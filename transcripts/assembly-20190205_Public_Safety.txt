IT AT THE END I ALSO WANT TO READ A STATEMENT FROM MY COLLEAGUE ON YES OTHER SITES THEY SENATOR HOLLY MITCHELL WHO IS AS WE ALL KNOW HAS BEEN A CHAMPION AND BEEN WORKING ON THIS FOR QUITE SOME TIME? THIS IS A BRIEF STATEMENT THAT SHE WANTED ME TO READ TO YOU. I INVITE EACH OF YOU TO JOIN ME IN THIS CRITICAL FIGHT FOR EQUITY AND JUSTICE. I STARTED TWENTY NINETEEN BY DOUBLING DOWN ON MY COMMITMENT OF REFORMING THE SYSTEM. BY INTRODUCING SB ONE FOR FOR THE FAMILIES OVER FEES ACTS WHICH WILL ELIMINATE CRIMINAL ADMINISTRATIVE FEES FOR ADULTS. WE CANNOT EXPECT TO MAKE REAL PROGRESS WITHOUT MAKING REAL AND SUBSTANTIAL CHANGES IN A TRULY. REGRESSIVE SYSTEM. NOW WHEN I FIRST WENT TO THE RIVER DUE TO REPORT. YOU KNOW AYE I'M A BIG FAN OF MOVIES AND A FAN OF CHRISTMAS MOVIES. AT ONE MY FAVE IS A CHRISTMAS CAROL AND STATE ALISTAIR ALISTAIR STARE VERSION AND REGIONAL -- IN VERSION NOT THE NOT THE CAPTAIN PICARD VERSION NOT THE LATER ONE OF A CHRISTMAS CAROL. AND IN IT. EBENEZER SCROOGE IS VISITED BY TOO CHARITY COLLECTORS. AND ONE SAYS AT THIS FESTIVE TIME OF YEAR MISTER SCROOGE IT IS MORE THAN USUAL DOES USUALLY DESIRABLE THAT WE SHOULD MAKE. SOME SLIGHT PROVISION FOR THE POOR. AND DESTITUTE. FOR WHICH EBENEZER SCROOGE ANSWERS ARE THERE NO PRISONS [inaudible] THE COLLECTOR'S. RESPOND PLENTY OF PRISONS AND EBENEZER REPLIES ANY UNIONS OF WORK HOUSES ARE THEY STILL IN OPERATION. WHICH DE COLLECTORS RESPOND THEY ARE I WISH THEY WERE NOT. THE TRADE IN EVERY NEEDS ARE DIDN'T REPLY TO TREADMILL AND THE POOR LAW. ARE IN FULL BIGGER THAN. SOME OF WHAT HE SAID. KIND OF DESCRIBES WHAT WE'RE GOING THROUGH RIGHT NOW WITH FINES AND FEES. HE FURTHER GOES ON AND THE BILL COLLECTORS ASK. WEATHER AND SOME OF THEM WOULD RATHER GO TO WOULD NOT WOULD RATHER DIE THAN GO TO PRISON. FOR WHICH EVER TEASERS SCREWS REPLIES. THEN LET IT BE SO WE CAN REDUCE THE POPULATION. THAT IS NOT THE KIND OF SOCIETY THAT WE WANT TO BE AN CHARLES DICKENS WHEN HE DESCRIBED WITH A DEBT WAS IN THE DEBTORS WAS FAMILIES IN A DEBTOR'S PRISON -- DEBTOR PRISON BACK IN THE EIGHTEEN HUNDREDS. WERE UNSANITARY OVERCROWDED. AND DANGEROUS ENVIRONMENTS IN WHICH DOES CONVICTED OF OWING MONEY. LET ME REPEAT THAT UP -- WE MONEY. THAT THEY COULD NOT PAY WERE PLACED IN GENERAL POPULATION WITH VIOLENT CRIMINALS. DICKENS WAS FORCED TO LEAVE SCHOOL TO WORK IN A FACTORY WHEN HIS FATHER. WAS THROWN INTO DEBTORS PRISON. WE HAVE PEOPLE NOW THERE WERE LOOK AT SHOPLIFTING. AS A METHOD OF SEEN PEOPLE BACK TO PRISON BY MAKING IT A FELONY. WE SHOULDN'T REGRESSED BACK TO THE EIGHTEEN HUNDREDS WE SHOULD BE MOVING FORWARD I THINK THIS IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY. TO SHOW HOW. A MONETARY RESTRICTIVE SYSTEM CAN LEAD. TO TWO PEOPLE WHO WERE LIVING IN POVERTY. FURTHER EXACERBATE THEIR SITUATION. AND SO I AM GOING UP. QUICKLY OKAY ANYONE TO MAKE ANY OPENING STATEMENTS OTHERWISE WE'LL GO RIGHT AND IT OF THAT I WOULD LIKE [inaudible] GO. TO I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR FOR IT AGAIN THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR HE SAID SAY THAT AGAIN THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I THINK REGGIE LIKE THAT -- FOR CONVENING THIS HEARING -- IT WAS SOMETHING I THINK WE TALKED ABOUT. DURING MOST OF THE REST OF LAST SESSION -- AND I'M GLAD TO SEE SO MANY FACES FAMILIAR AND NEW -- TO THIS HEARING BECAUSE I THINK IT IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT I'M SURE LIKE MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES I'M HERE TO LISTEN AND TO LEARN SO THAT WE CAN TAKE ACTION. IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE ARE HEARING SOLUTIONS AND TALKING ABOUT UNCOMFORTABLE PROBLEMS THAT ARE FACED IN THE SYSTEM. SO THAT WE CAN DEVELOP A SYSTEM THAT IS FAIR -- WE HAVE GOT TO STOP BUILDING SYSTEMS ON THE BACKS OF THE POOR AND THEN BREAKING THEIR BACKS BECAUSE THEY ARE POOR -- I WON'T GET IN WHILE THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT IN NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE AND BEARDEN BE GEORGIA INTERPRETED THE EQUAL JUSTICE CLAUSE OF THE FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT TO MEAN THAT JAILING PEOPLE FOR NOT PAYING FINES. AND FEES IS THE LEGAL UNLESS THE NON PAYMENT WAS WILL FALL WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO TALK ABOUT FOR REALLY CRITICAL ISSUES. ABOUT OUR JUDGES ABOUT OFFENDERS AND THE PARENTS AND FAMILY MEMBERS OF THE OFFENDERS ABOUT LAW ENFORCEMENT AND ALSO ABOUT RACE AND ECONOMICS. AS IT RELATES TO JUDGES THERE ARE A LOT OF CONCERNS THAT LIE IN HOW JUDGES INTERPRET THE WORD WELL -- FOR AND SO JAILING SOMEONE BECAUSE THEY ARE AN ABLE TO PAY FINES AND FEES AND HAVING INCONSISTENT STANDARDS ABOUT HOW WILLFUL IS DEFINED IS REALLY IMPORTANT. WE HAVE TO WE HAVE INSTANCES WHERE IF JUVENILES HAVE OUTSTANDING DEBT BY THE TIME THEY TURN EIGHTEEN OR WHEN THEY TURN EIGHTEEN THAT DEBT TURNS INTO A CIVIL JUDGMENT WE HAVE SITUATIONS WHERE YOUNG FOLKS ARE JAIL. ARE UNABLE TO PAY THAT DEBT THAT DEBT THEN GOES TO THE PARENTS OF THE PARENTS ARE UNABLE TO PAY THE DEBT THEN THE PARENTS ARE JAILED AS WELL. WE HAVE TO HAVE SERIOUS CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THE ECONOMIC IMPLICATIONS OF THAT KIND OF PROCESS OF THOSE KINDS OF PROCEDURES WE HAVE GOT TO US WE HAVE TO ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT IS ASKED TO DO DOUBLE DUTY. LAW ENFORCEMENT SHOULD NOT BE PROTECTING AND COLLECTING. THAT JUST AIN'T RIGHT. AND IT ALLOWS FOR A LOT OF HOLES. TO BE BY PASSED. AND THEN LASTLY ULTIMATELY WE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT THE RACE. IMPLICATIONS ON THE ECONOMIC Ã¡P IMPLICATIONS OF THIS KIND OF SYSTEM. WE KNOW THAT FOR AFRICAN AMERICANS THEIR 68% LESS LIKELY TO HAVE CASES DISMISSED BY THE COURT. AT LEAST 50% MORE LIKELY TO THAT LEAD TO ARREST AND ACCOUNT 492% OF CASES IN WHICH COURT ISSUE THE COURT WILL ISSUE AN ARREST WARRANT. THIS SAME NUMBER IS NOT AS HIGH CAN BE SAID FOR OTHER -- COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AND SO WE HAVE GOT TO ALSO HAVE UNCOMFORTABLE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT WHY THERE ARE DISPROPORTIONATE NUMBER OF PEOPLE OF COLOR AND POOR PEOPLE THAT ARE JAILED AND ULTIMATELY THEY ARE JAIL BECAUSE THEY ARE POOR. I'M HOPING THAT WE CAN COME TO SOME SOLUTIONS IN THIS HEARING SO THAT WE CAN WORK WITH OUR ADVOCATES AND OUR STAKEHOLDERS. TO REALLY MAKE THIS A LEGITIMATE AND ADJUST TO SYSTEM SO THANK YOU FOR CONVENING. THANK YOU MISTER LACKEY. YEAH JUST REAL QUICKLY I AM. I THINK THAT EVERYONE WOULD AGREE THAT -- WE HAVE A A VERY SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM ON OUR HANDS WITHIN THE THE MAJORITY. OF THESE -- FINES ARE BEING COLLECTED. OUR BECAUSE OF ENFORCEMENT AGAINST TRAFFIC OFFENSE. THESE AREN'T -- CRIMINAL OFFENSES THESE ARE PRIMARILY INFRACTIONS. BEING COMMITTED BY BY THE GENERAL PUBLIC. WE TALK ABOUT -- THE THE UNFAIR FOCUS UPON THE POOR. I WILL TELL YOU THAT IT'S A TRAFFIC CITATION FOR FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS. IS TOUGH FOR MOST AMERICANS MOST CALIFORNIA'S NOT JUST POOR. AND HERE'S THE BIGGER PROBLEM WE TALK ABOUT. BEING ABLE TO ARRIVE AT SOLUTIONS I HOPE WE DON'T JUST GET TOO HEAVY. ON THE PROBLEM BECAUSE WE ALL AGREE ON THE PROBLEM. THE SOLUTIONS BECOME VERY VERY DIFFICULT BECAUSE WE'VE ARRIVED AT THIS PROBLEM. OVER DECADES. THIS IS BEEN AN INCREMENTAL -- DEATH BY A THOUSAND CUTS TYPE OF THING BECAUSE NOW. WE HAVE INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE LANCE ON THE FUNDS THAT COME FROM THESE OFFENSES. HAD SO WHEN WE SAY THAT WE WANT TO DIVERT. THIS FUNDING MECHANISM TO THE GENERAL FUND WHICH IS LESS RELIABLE YOU'RE GOING TO SEE HUGE. OUTRAGE BY THE PEOPLE WHO ARE FUNDED BY. THESE FUNDS AND SO WE HAVE A VERY SERIOUS PROBLEM THAT WE SHOULD IDENTIFY A SERIOUS AND THERE'S NO EASY SOLUTIONS BUT TO ME. THE REMEDY IS THE SAME WAY THAT WE GOT HERE IT'S GOING TO HAVE TO BE INCREMENTAL. AND AND STARTING TO A REDUCE SOME OF THESE COSTS -- THAT'S NOT GONNA COME WITHOUT SOME REALLY SEVERE -- DIFFICULTY SO. I HATE TO A RAIN ON THE PARADE BUT I THINK THAT THIS IS GOING TO BE VERY VERY DIFFICULT AND I HOPE THAT WE CAN PUT OUR HEADS TOGETHER FIGURE THIS OUT. THANK YOU IN [inaudible] WE'RE GOOD. OKAY. SO LET'S BEGIN WITH THE OVERVIEW OF FINES AND FEES BY THE LA OWES OFFICE. OF WHO WANTS TO START FIRST. GOOD MORNING THANK YOU FOR HAVING US ANNUALLY ALONG WITH MY COLLEAGUE LUKE KUSH MORROW -- WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE WE WERE ASKED TO PROVIDE A LITTLE BIT OF CONTEXT TO FRAME YOUR DISCUSSION ABOUT FINES AND FEES TODAY -- I BELIEVE THE SERGEANTS HAVE PASSED OUT A HANDOUT THAT WILL BE USING SERVE AS A GUIDE -- FOR OUR COMMENTS TODAY THIS CANNOT IS ALSO NOW AVAILABLE ONLINE IF YOU PREFER TO ACCESS IT THAT WAY AS WELL. SO IF YOU TURN TO PAGE WHAT. IT LOOKS LIKE THIS. WE CAN GET THAT. YES THAT. ONE THE BILL THAT'S THE OLD VERSIONS OF THERE'S IT MIGHT. ACROSS NOW. I'M SORRY MOSTLY COMMITTEE DIDN'T GET. I AM I APOLOGIZE -- FOR IF YOU TURN TO PAGE ONE OF YOUR HAND OUT OUR COMMENTS ARE REALLY GONNA FOCUS ON KIND OF TWO AREAS. I'M GOING TO WALK YOU THROUGH CONTEXT ABOUT THE CRIMINAL FINES AND FEES IN THESE ARE THE ASSESSMENTS THAT A TRIAL COURT WILL LEVY UPON AN INDIVIDUAL. WHO IS CONVICTED OF A CRIMINAL OFFENSE WHICH DOES INCLUDE TRAFFIC VIOLATIONS -- MY COLLEAGUE LUKE WILL THEN BE CHATTING AND PROVIDING CONTEXT ABOUT THE PROBATION FEES AND THESE ARE FEES THAT STATE LAW AUTHORIZES PROBATION DEPARTMENTS TO CHARGE TO COVER SOME OF THEIR COSTS. IF YOU TURN TO PAGE TWO OF YOUR HAND OUT WE'LL GET STARTED WITH THOSE CRIMINAL FINES AND FEES. WE PROVIDED A TABLE HERE THAT WILL SERVE AS AN EXAMPLE FOR HOW THE TOTAL AMOUNT WILL BE ASSESSED ON THE TO EXAMPLE THAT YOU HAVE IS FOR STOP SIGN VIOLATION AND THEN FOR A D. Y.. IF YOU LOOK AT THE VERY FIRST LINE OF THE TABLE HE CAN START THAT THE YOU CAN SEE THAT THE ASSESSMENT GENERALLY STARTS WITH THE BASE FINE. THE BASELINE FOR THE STOP SIGN VIOLATION IS THIRTY FIVE DOLLARS AND FOR THE D. WHY IT'S THREE HUNDRED AND NINETY DOLLARS. STATE LAW THEN AS YOU MOVE DOWN THE TABLE STATE LAW AUTHORIZES THE EDITION OF CHARGES SUMMER RIP -- VOLUNTARY DEPENDING ON THE TYPE OF OFFENSE AND OTHER FACTORS THAT THAT CAN OCCUR. AT THE VERY BOTTOM YOU CAN SEE THE TOTAL AMOUNT -- FOR THE STOP SIGN VIOLATION IT BECOMES TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY EIGHT DOLLARS AND FOR A DO YOU WHY -- IT'S A LITTLE BIT OVER TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS AND SO FROM THE BASELINE IT'S ABOUT YOU KNOW FIVE TO SIX TIMES MORE THAN WHAT THE BASELINE WAS. JUDGES DO YOU HAVE THE ABILITY TO REDUCE OR WAVE SOME OF THESE CHARGES. IF YOU THEN TURN TO PAGE THREE OF YOUR HAND OUT. A FINE IN FEE LEVELS HAVE INCREASED PRETTY SIGNIFICANTLY OVER TIME SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND FIVE AND THAT HAS BEEN BOTH IN THE THE SIZE OF THE CHARGE AS WELL AS AN ADDITIONAL CHARGES I HAVE BEEN ADDED. AND SO FOR THE STOP SIGN VIOLATION WHICH WE JUST TALKED CHATTED ABOUT ON THE PREVIOUS PAGE YOU CAN SEE THAT THE TOTAL AMOUNT. INCREASED BY ABOUT 54% THAT'S A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT INCREASE. THESE FINES AND FEES ARE CHARGED FOR VARIOUS PURPOSES PSALM IS TO REFLECT THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE OFFENSE. SOME IS TO GENERATE REVENUE TO SUPPORT SPECIFIC TYPES OF ACTIVITIES AND OTHERS ARE JUST ARE USED TO TO KIND OF OFFSET STATE AND LOCAL COSTS FOR PROVIDING CERTAIN SERVICES. IF YOU THEN TURN TO PAGE FOUR OF YOUR HAND OUT. ONCE PAYMENT IS COLLECTED TO ADDRESS THE FINES AND FEES THAT ARE CHARGED THEY ARE DISTRIBUTED TO A VARIETY OF STATE AND LOCAL FUNDS. AND SO IN TOTAL THERE ARE ABOUT -- THEIR UP TO FIFTY STATE FINDS AN ADDITION TO MANY LOCAL FINDS THAT ARE ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE THESE DOLLARS -- STATE LAW THAN DICTATES A PRETTY CALM HOW ALL PAYMENTS ARE DISTRIBUTED TO THESE VARIOUS AND LOCAL FINES. AND THERE ARE RULES THAT ARE DEPENDENT ON THE SPECIFIC FINANCIALLY THAT'S CHARGED IN ADDITION TO ADDITIONAL ROLES IF PAYMENT IS NOT RECEIVED AND FALL. AND NAMELY THAT MEANS WHAT PAYMENTS WHAT CHARGES ARE KIND OF ADDRESSED FIRST AS YOU GO DOWN THIS HIERARCHICAL LAST. IF YOU TURN TO PAGE FIVE OF YOUR HAND OUT WE THEN PROVIDE A PIE CHART THAT KIND OF SHOWS WHERE THIS MONEY GOES AND WHO BENEFITS. IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN SIXTEEN ABOUT ONE POINT SEVEN BILLION WAS DISTRIBUTED TO STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. LOOK AT THE PIE CHART BEFORE YOU ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE YOU CAN SEE THAT ABOUT 50% OR EIGHT HUNDRED AND EIGHTY ONE MILLION WENT TO THE STATE. AND OF THIS AMOUNT ABOUT 60% WENT TO SUPPORT TRIAL CORE OPERATIONS ARE CONSTRUCTION. IF YOU LOOK AT THE RIGHT HAND SIDE OF THE PIE CHART. ABOUT 42% OF THAT THEN WENT TO SUPPORT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WITH ABOUT 80% OF THAT GOING TO THE COUNTY IS. THE SMALLEST SLIVER THAT LIGHT SLIVER -- WE ALSO KIND OF COVER ON PAGE SIX ABOUT 7% ABOUT A HUNDRED AND FOURTEEN MILLION DOLLARS. THAT GOES TO COURTS AND COUNTY IS THAT OPERATE COLLECTION PROGRAMS IN THESE OTHER COSTS RELATED TO COLLECT COLLECTING DELINQUENT PAYMENTS -- AND SO BEFORE I TURN THINGS OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE LUKE TO TALK ABOUT PROBATION FEES WE WOULD AS AS THE CHAIR REFERENCE WE HAVE DONE -- SOME WORK IN THIS AREA OUR OFFICE HAS RELEASED A REPORT WITH OUR RECOMMENDATIONS. ABOUT IMPROVING THE OVERALL KAMAL FIND IN THE SYSTEM WE WON'T GET INTO IT WE'RE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS IF YOU HAVE THEM. BUT IN A NUTSHELL AT THE HIGH LEVEL WE RECKON THE OVERALL SYSTEM WHAT'S THE GOAL OF THE SYSTEM HOW HOW SHOULD ABILITY TO PAY BE INCORPORATED OVER TIME WHAT HAPPENS TO LEVELS OF FINES AND FEES EXCITER UP. WE ALSO RECOMMENDED KIND OF INCREASING LEGISLATIVE CONTROL OVER THE USE OF THE DOLLARS WE DID RECOMMEND DEPOSITING MOST OF THE REVENUE INTO THE GENERAL FUND. CONSOLIDATING MOST OF THE FINES AND FEES. REEVALUATING THE PROGRAMS THAT ARE SUPPORTED BY THIS TYPE OF REVENUE -- AND THEN FINALLY MITIGATING THE IMPACTS THAT -- WOULD BE EXPERIENCED BY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. AND SO WITH THAT I'M GONNA TURN THINGS OVER TO MY COLLEAGUES TO TALK ABOUT PREVENTION PLEASE. TOMORROW THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE WE ARE ASKED ABOUT AN OVERVIEW OF THE FEES LEVIED ON PROBATION ORDERS NOT TO DO SO WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT BUT THE SPECIFIC FEES LEVIED. BY COUNTIES AS WELL AS THAT GIVE A SENSE THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF FEES INNOVATION OR MIGHT OF OR PERIOD OF OPERATION. SO IT STARTED OUT WITH THE TABLE ON PAGE -- SEVEN WE'VE PUT TOGETHER A SAMPLE OF SOME OF THE FEES CHARGED BY THREE COUNTIES. IS DESIGNED TO GIVE A SENSE OF THE VARIABILITY IN THE SIZE NUMBER AND TYPE OF FEES CHARGED BY THE COUNTIES. SO FOR INSTANCE WE GO TO THE FIRST ROW OF THE TABLE GPS MONITORING IS CHARGING A DAILY BASIS. WITH SAN LUIS OBISPO COUNTY CHARGING ABOUT FOUR HOW DO YOU COUNTY CHARGES ABOUT HALF OF THIS AMOUNT OF FIVE TO SEVEN DOLLARS PER DAY. WE GO DOWN THE NEXT ROW SUPERVISION FEES ARE CHARGED ON A MONTHLY BASIS. WITH -- FAMILIES OBISPO COUNTY CHARGING SEVENTY SIX DOLLARS PER MONTH. WHILE SAN DIEGO COUNTY CHARGES SEVENTEEN TO ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SIX DOLLARS PER MONTH DEPEND ON THE LEVEL OF SUPERVISION PROVIDED -- AND THEN IN ADDITION NOT ALL OF THESE COUNTIESCHARGES SAME FEE SO IF YOU GO TO THE LAST ROW OF THE TABLE. PROBATION VIOLATIONS RESULTS IN FEES AND BUTTE COUNTY OF ABOUT A HUNDRED NINE DOLLARS. BUT WE SEE THAT SOUND WAS OBISPO COUNTY AND SAN DIEGO COUNTY DO NOT CHARGE THAT FEE AT ALL. FOR THE MORE ABILITY TO PAY CAN BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT. TO EITHER ADJUST OR EVEN WAY SOME OF THE FEES. AND INABILITY TO PAY DOES NOT NECESSARILY PREVENT SERVICES FROM BEING PROVIDED SUCH AS SUPERVISION OR ELECTRONIC MONITORING. GOING ON TO PAGE. EIGHT WE WANTED TO GIVE A SENSE OF THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF RELATIONAL MIGHT -- IN ORDER TO DO SO WE CONSTRUCTED TO HYPOTHETICAL PROBATIONERS AND LOOK AT THE FEES THEY WOULD -- OVER THREE HOURS IN THAT SCENARIO AS WE CREATED -- WE FIND AT THE LEVEL OF SUPERVISION SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTS THE FEE AMOUNT. SO FOR INSTANCE IF WE GO TO THE FIRST COLUMN OF THE TABLE AND SAN LUIS OBISPO COUNTY. THAT LOW SUPERVISION PROBATION OR WHAT -- THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS OVER THREE HOURS IN THE SCENARIO WE CREATED WHILE THE HIGH SUPERVISION CREATION OR WHAT -- SIX TIMES AS MUCH OR EIGHTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS. WE GO OVER THE BUTTE COUNTY ON THE FAR RIGHT WITH YET THE LOSI PROVISION PROVISIONAL WOULD ONLY -- ABOUT ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS BUT THE HIGHS -- ABOUT SIXTEEN TIMES THAT AMOUNT OR SIXTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS. WE HAVE THE SERVICEMEN HELPFUL AND ARE HAVE ANSWERED THE QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE THE YEAH. CAN YOU GIVE US A SENSE -- BUT HOW MUCH. ON COLLECTED FEES AND FINES -- IS KIND OF OUTSTANDING EVERY WEEK WHEN I FIRST GOT HERE. WE HAD A DISCUSSION ABOUT TRAFFIC. FINES AND FEES AND HOW MUCH TO COURTS. THOSE IS NEVER GONNA MOUNT THEY WERE ASKED I THINK THEY WERE LIKE ONE POINT EIGHT WHEN I GOT IN TWENTY TWELVE IS LIKE ONE POINT. EIGHT BILLION OUT THERE AND THEY WERE ASKING FOR A BILLION IN. AND BEING A FRESHMAN ASSEMBLY MEMBER I SAID ONCE YOU JUST COLLECTED IN IN YOU CAN SOLVE YOUR BUDGET PROBLEM. AND EVIDENTLY I LEARNED IS NOT THAT EASY. TALK ABOUT HOW MUCH. ARE WE LOOKING OUT THERE IN THE SO AS A FIFTEEN SIXTEEN WE ARE TALKING ABOUT TWELVE BILLION A LITTLE BIT OVER TWELVE BILLION IN OUTSTANDING. DEBT -- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE WOULD HIGHLIGHT IS THAT -- ONE OF THINGS THAT WE FOUND IS THAT THERE WAS SOME WEAKNESSES IN THE COMPREHENSIVE COLLECTION OF INFORMATION ABOUT COLLECTIONS AND DISTRIBUTION. AND NE OF OUR REPORTS WE ACTUALLY HAVE A FIGURE THAT SHOWS -- A GRAPHIC OF THE MISMATCH BETWEEN THE TWO AND SO WE DID WE DID OFFER RECOMMENDATIONS PROVE THAT SIDE BECAUSE ONE OF THE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE HIGHLIGHTED IS FOR THE LEGISLATURE. TO MAKE CHANGES OR TO HELP THEM MAKE DECISIONS COMPREHENSIVE INFORMATION IS HELPFUL I NEED IT. OF THE TWELVE BILLION DOLLARS IT'S UNCLEAR HOW MUCH OF THAT IS ACTUALLY COLLECTIBLE AND SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT ACTUAL COLLECTIBILITY. ON IT COSTS COURTS AND COUNTIES A CERTAIN AMOUNT TO COLLECT THESE DOLLARS AND AT SOME POINT IT COSTS YOU MORE THAN WHAT YOU WOULD BRING IN AND THAT'S WHAT WHEN WE SAY I ON COLLECTIBLE THAT'S WHAT WE MEAN. AND SO ONE OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WE HAD WAS THAT WE THOUGHT THAT THERE SHOULD BE AN ASSESSMENT. ABOUT THE COLLECTIBILITY OF OF THAT DEBT. GOOD AND THEN YOU MENTIONED. THERE FOR IT. FIFTY PINE TREES ARE COLLECTED -- AND IN A MONIES DISTRIBUTED THERE'S ABOUT FIFTY DIFFERENT. DO WE HAVE A PRIORITY ORDER OR IS IT. SO IT IS SELF FIFTY I LEGISLATION. THERE THERE COULD BE MORE WE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THERE COULD BE MORE -- THE PRIORITY KICKS AND WHEN PAYMENT ISN'T. PROVIDED IN FULL -- AND SO TO GET IT SO TO GIVE ANY AS RESTITUTION. THE SECONDS KIND OF WITH A SECOND PRIORITY ORDER IS COSTS RELATED TO THE COLLECTION OF DELINQUENT THAT AND THERE'S A COST RECOVERY PROCESS. THAT'S AND THAT'S IN PLACE -- AND THEN THEIR SUBSEQUENT ORDERS AS WELL AND THERE ABOUT FIVE TEARS IN TOTAL AND ALMOST ALL OF THE FINES AND FEES THAT ARE CHARGED WILL FALL INTO ONE OF THOSE. FIVE CATEGORIES AND SO ONE OF THE INTERESTING THINGS ABOUT -- OUR SYSTEM ON THE COLLECTION SIDE IS THAT NEITHER THE COURTS NOR THE COUNTIES HAVE. THE GREATEST FISCAL INCENTIVES TO COLLECT SO I THINK THAT'S THAT'S ONE THING ON ON THE REVENUE SIDE THAT'S THAT'S DIFFERENT FROM THE POLICY WE'RE NOT WEIGHING IN ON THE POLICY THAT'S A DECISION -- FOR LEGISLATIVE MEMBERS -- TO MAKE. PART OF THAT RATIONALE AS AS YOU GO DOWN THE PRIORITY LIST IF YOU'RE AT THE BOTTOM YOU'RE IN THE LOWER PRIORITY AS THINGS ARE COMING OFF THE TOP. IT MIGHT MEAN THAT YOU DON'T GET YOUR FULL THE FULL AMOUNT THAT WAS ASSESSED. RELATED TO THE FINER FEE THAT YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO GET AND GAIN FROM. AND SO THAT REDUCES SOME OF THE THE FISCAL AND SENT. TO THE OTHER PIECE ON ON KIND OF COLLECTIONS IS THAT. THERE REALLY WASN'T INCENTIVE. TO COLLECT WHEN DAD WAS NON DELINQUENT SO THIS IS BEFORE ALL OF THE VARIOUS TOOLS THAT THE STATE HAS AUTHORIZED THESE ARE THINGS LIKE BEFORE IT WAS THE DRIVER'S LICENSE SUSPENSION -- WAGE GARNISHMENT SELENE'S AND SO ONE OF THINGS THAT WE FOUND WAS THAT THERE ARE THINGS THAT COURTS COULD DO COURTS IN COUNTIES COULD DEAL AND SOME OF THEM WERE DOING IT -- TO HELP INDIVIDUALS STAY ON TRACK THESE INCLUDED THINGS LIKE PAYMENT REMINDERS TO SOMETIMES IF YOU GET A UTILITY BILL ALL RIGHT YOU'LL GET A LITTLE NOTICE SAYING YOU OWE THIS MUCH. AND SO THEY IS SOME COURTS AND COUNTIES FOUNDED THAT WAS REALLY REALLY HELPFUL. BUT COSTS RELATED TO NON DELINQUENT COLLECTIONS WHICH IS BEHAVIOR WE POTENTIALLY WOULD WANT. ON SAMPLE SIZE WASN'T RECOVERABLE UNDER THE CURRENT STRUCTURE THAT WE HAVE -- RELATED TO DON'T COLLECTING DELINQUENT PAYMENTS. AND SO THAT SORT OF IT IN A NUTSHELL I MEAN I THINK THERE ARE OTHER THINGS THAT WE FOUND BUT HOPEFULLY THAT ADDRESSES YOUR QUESTION. OKAY AND IN THE LAST WHEN YOU. YOU YOU MENTIONED ABOUT. HAVING THESE FINES AND FEES GO INTO THE GENERAL FUND WITH WITH THAT WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT WE WOULD RE PROGRAM THIS MONEY BACK INTO PUBLIC SAFETY ONLY AND TO COLONEL JESS THAT THERE WOULD BE DIVERTED TO TRANSPORTATION OUR SCHOOLS SAID IT WOULD STAY. HOPEFULLY WITHIN. PER VIEW OF PUBLIC SAFETY OR IT BAR GOES A GENERAL FUND AND ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN. THERE ARE MULTI THEIR MULTIPLE REASONS FOR OUR RECOMMENDATION TO PAUSE INTO THE GENERAL FUND. THE FIRST MAJOR RATIONALE FOR THAT IS THAT. OVER TIME VARIOUS CRIMINAL FINES AND FEES HAVE BEEN ADDED ON FOR A WHOLE VARIETY OF PROCESS THESE AND FOR CERTAIN PROGRAMS. THE AMOUNT WHAT THEY DO BASICALLY THEIR OP PENDANTS ON THE AMOUNT OF FINING FEE REVENUE THAT'S COMING AND IT WAS NEVER REALLY MATCHED UP TO THE SERVICE LEVEL. THAT THE LEGISLATURE WAS EXPECTING. AND SO PART ONE OF THE REASONS FOR THAT IS THEN ESSENTIALLY TO DE COUPLE THAT RATIONALE AND SO THEN THE LEGISLATURE COULD FOCUS ON WHAT PROGRAM WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HOW IT WHAT ARE OUR EXPECTATIONS FOR THAT PROGRAM AND HOW MUCH WOULD IT COST. TO LIVE IT TO DELIVER THOSE SERVICES IT'S SOMETHING THAT IS ACTUALLY HAPPENING ON THE BUDGET SIDE. MISTER CHAIR YOU'LL YOU'LL BE HAVING THAT AS PART OF YOUR BUDGET DISCUSSIONS BECAUSE OVER TIME WE'VE HAD A NUMBER OF PROGRAMS -- AND FUNDS ENTERING INTO KIND OF INSOLVENCY OUR OPERATION SHORTFALL BECAUSE AMOUNT OF FINE AND FEE REVENUE THAT'S BEEN COMING AND HAS BEEN DECLINING. THE STATE'S TAKEN A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT ACTIONS INCLUDING BACK FILLING SOME OF THEM SHIFTING SOME OF THE PROGRAMS TO THE GENERAL FIND AND ALSO IMPLEMENTING REDUCTIONS. SO THAT'S KIND OF ONE PIECE. THE SECOND ASPECT IS. BECAUSE WE HAVE THIS VERY COMPLEX PROCESS FOR DISTRIBUTING TO ALL OF THE STATE AND LOCAL FINDS. SOME OF THESE PROGRAMS ARE NOT LOOKED AT AND EVALUATED BY THE LEGISLATURE ON AN ANNUAL BASIS AS PART OF THE BUDGET PROCESS FOR EXAMPLE. THESE PROGRAMS COME BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE WHEN THERE'S A PROBLEM. ESSENTIALLY THAT THEY'RE RUNNING OUT OF REVENUE AND OR YOU KNOW REVENUES AND EXPENDITURES ARE NOT MATCHED UP. AND THAT REALLY LIMITS THE LEGISLATURE'S ABILITIES IN TERMS OF WHAT TO DO TO ADDRESS THAT ISSUE. THE CONCEPT IS BASICALLY IF YOU KNOW THE PROBLEM IS COMING -- YOU CAN POTENTIALLY IMPLEMENT SOLUTIONS EARLIER ON THAT CAN MAKE IT LESS PAINFUL TO IMPLEMENT ESSENTIALLY -- IN TERMS OF THAN DEDICATING THE FUNDING SPECIFICALLY TO PUBLIC SAFETY THAT'S CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT THE LEGISLATURE CAN TALK ABOUT -- IT'S EIGHT SIX IT'LL BE IN THE GENERAL FUND SO THERE'S A QUESTION ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT WANT TO DEDICATE A CERTAIN PART OF PORTION OF THAT MONEY. TO PLEASE BUT FOR US WE THINK THAT IT IS A DECISION FOR THE LEGISLATURE AMONGST ALL OF ITS GENERAL FUND PRIORITIES. WE DON'T YOU KNOW THERE'S NOT THEIR VARIOUS RATIONALES CURRENTLY FOR HOW WE ASSESS THESE FINES AND FEES. AND WHEN WE TALK ABOUT OUR RECOMMENDATION ABOUT CONSOLIDATING MOST OF THE FINES AND FEES THE LEGISLATURE CONSENT THOSE FINES AND FEES BASED ON WHAT GOALS THEY WANT TO ME. SO FOR EXAMPLE IF THE GOAL IS DETERRENCE THAT CAN BE ONE FEE. IF FOR WAR FINE IF THE GOAL IS TO OFFSET THE IMPACTS OF WHATEVER THE BEHAVIOR AS IT CAN BE SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT. GOALS ARE NOT MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE BUT IT'S HOPEFUL TO HAVE DIRECTION FROM THE LEGISLATURE ABOUT WHAT THE LAW WHAT THE POLICY DIRECTION POLICY RATIONALE IS FOR THESE FINES AND FEES. THANK YOU NOT PROJECTED TO GO. NOW IN. BEEN [inaudible] MR QUIRK [inaudible] I'M [inaudible] SORRY. HE IS THE SECOND. I SEEM TO HAVE SOME BRONCHITIS -- THE WELL FIRST OF ALL THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- BOTH OF YOU FOR YOUR FINE PRESENTATION AND MISLI FOR THAT RECENT ANSWER -- I REALLY THINK YOU'VE HIT ON THIS SO [inaudible] WE THE CHAIR AND I HAVE BEEN ON THIS COMMITTEE FOR A LITTLE OVER SIX YEARS AND WE LOVE IT. WE DID I I THINK I DO SOME OF MY MOST IMPORTANT WORK HERE BECAUSE WE TRIED TO MAKE THE SYSTEM IS JUST AS WE CAN -- THIS TIME PERIOD -- STAFF IS MADE IS VERY AWARE THAT WHEN THERE'S A THIRTY FIVE DOLLAR BASE. FINE -- IT CAN. GO UP TO TWO HUNDRED THIRTY EIGHT DOLLARS -- AND WE OFTEN GET PEOPLE IN HERE WANTING TO INCREASE THE BASE FINE AND WE TELL THEM. YOU KNOW THE REAL FINE IS REALLY EIGHT OR TEN TIMES LARGER AND SO YOU REALLY SHOULDN'T DO THAT GENERAL I DON'T THINK WE'VE LET ANY OF THOSE GO WELL YOU'VE BEEN CHAIR I WAS CHAIR. ANJANA WHICH CHAIR HOWEVER. THESE FEES. PEOPLE DEPEND UPON THEM I DO REMEMBER WHEN THE EMS PENALTY ASSESSMENT CAME UP AND SAID IS THE CHAIR. THE DIFFICULTY WAS SO WHICH TWO DOLLARS FOR EVERY TEN OF BASS FINE AND FRANKLY IF THAT WERE THE ONLY. ENHANCEMENT WE HAD IT MIGHT NOT BE SO BAD BUT UNFORTUNATELY AS YOU MENTIONED IT'S ONE OF MANY. THE DIFFICULTY. AND EVEN -- THE AS CHAIR AT THE TIME MELISSA MELENDEZ -- SAID THAT GEE THIS IS NOT JUST OUR FEES ARE TOO HIGH AND I AGREE WITH THAT BUT THE PROBLEM WAS IF WE DIDN'T EXTENDED. THEN THE PEOPLE IN EMS THIS WAS A MAJOR PART OF THEIR FUNDING -- SO THE FIREMEN WERE HERE AND OTHER -- AMBULANCE COMPANIES WERE HERE AND IT WE REALLY NEED THIS AND PARTICULARLY WAS FIRE AND THEY'RE VERY HARD TO SAY NO. TO SO THE AND I'M SURE THAT THE COURTS WOULD COMPLAIN IF WE TAKE OFF ANY OF THESE -- THE COUNTIES WILL COMPLAIN -- I THINK. THIS IS JUST GOING TO BE VERY HARD TO DO BECAUSE ALL OF THESE ARE HERE FOR YOU NOW REASONABLE. WELL MAYBE NOT ALL OF THEM BUT MANY OF THEM ARE HERE BECAUSE THEY SUPPORT GOOD CAUSES -- AND THE COUNTY CERTAINLY WON'T TRUST ISSUE THAT GOES TO THE GENERAL FUND ELSE CREAM SO WILL THE COURTS SO WELL EMS. THIS IS WHAT I'M SAYING IS FRANKLY THERE OUGHT TO BE A BASE THE PERIOD. IT OUGHT TO GO TO THE GENERAL FUND AND THEN WE SHOULD PAY THESE OTHER THINGS BUT I DON'T KNOW THAT ANY OF THE GROUPS THAT GET ANY OF THIS MONEY WILL TRUST US -- TO SEND IT BACK TO THEM SO. THAT'S THE DIFFICULTY WE FACE AND I'M MENTIONING THIS FOR THE EDUCATION OF OUR NEW MEMBERS WE HAVE TWO NEW THIS YEAR AND THAT'S THAT'S WHAT WE FACE. I'M CERTAINLY WILLING TO LOOK AT A RADICAL SOLUTION BUT IT'S GONNA BE TOUGH [inaudible] THANK. THANK YOU BOTH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION IT'S SUPER HELPFUL -- ON THE BENEFITS IS PRETTY CLEAR WHO'S BENEFITING FROM ALL THESE FINES AND FEES -- YOU WHO VERY SMALL PERCENTAGE HERE ON THE COLLECTION PROGRAM WHAT ARE THE ADDITIONAL COSTS THAT GO INTO COLLECTING THESE FEES AND HOW DOES THAT COMPARE WITH THE BENEFIT. COULD YOU CLARIFY ON COULD YOU PLEASE CLARIFY I'M NOT QUITE SURE IN TERMS OF THE ADDITIONAL COSTS SO I ASSUME THE COUNTIES BEAR ADDITIONAL COST BEYOND JUST THE 7% OF COLLECTION PROGRAMS ARE NOT GOING TO COLLECTING THE SKIS -- YES SO THE 7% THAT YOU HAVE HIGHLIGHTED THAT IS THE COURT AND COUNTY COSTS FOR COLLECTING WHEN IT'S DELINQUENT -- SO THERE ARE ADDITIONAL COSTS ON BOTH SIDES WHEN THEY'RE COLLECTING -- WHEN IT'S NON DELINQUENT AND SO THEY ME IN COURT IN QUESTION AND WHAT THE AGREEMENT IS BETWEEN THE TWO OF THEM SO FOR EXAMPLE? THERE ARE CERTAIN COUNTIES WHERE THE COURT COLLECTS EVERYTHING. AND THEN THERE ARE OTHER COUNTIES WHERE THE COURT COLLECTS. 80% OF IT AND THEN THE COUNTY COLLECTS UP ANOTHER PORTION OF IT I THINK ONE OF THE ONE OF THE ONES THAT WE HAD HEARD MOST FREQUENTLY. WAS THAT -- FOR EXAMPLE THE COUNTY WOULD COLLECT THE PROBATION FEES -- IT BECAUSE SOME OF THOSE WOULD MORE DIRECTLY GO TO LIKE THE PROBATION DEPARTMENT ETCETERA -- WE DON'T HAVE A GREAT IDEA OF HOW MUCH THEY'RE PUTTING INTO THAT WE'VE HEARD ON A PIECEMEAL BASIS THAT IT CAN RANGE FROM THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS TO SOMETIMES EVEN IN THE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. I THINK WHEN WE LOOKED -- SO BEFORE THE REPORT THAT THE TERM MENTIONS IN 200-015-2000 SIXTEEN WHICH WAS FOCUSED ON THE DISTRIBUTION AND ASSESSMENT WE ACTUALLY DID A REPORT ON THE COLLECTION SIDE. AS WELL AND SO -- SOME OF THINGS THAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT IN TERMS OF THE LACK OF FISCAL INCENTIVES TO COLLECT THAT WAS -- THAT RESULTED FROM THAT REPORT INTO SPECIFICALLY IN RELATION TO YOUR QUESTION. IT WAS THAT ISSUE FOR US IN TERMS OF THERE ARE THINGS THAT WERE BEING DONE ON THE DON'T NON DELINQUENT SIDE THAT IF YOU'RE GOING TO OPERATE A COLLECTIONS PROGRAM THE STATE'S DECIDED THAT THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO -- YOU'D PROBABLY WANT TO KIND OF REWARD THAT BEHAVIOR IN AN INCENTIVE STRUCTURE AND OUR CURRENT IN STOCK INCENTIVE STRUCTURE DOESN'T DO THAT. THERE WERE SCENARIOS ACTUALLY WHEN WE'RE MODELING IT THAT THERE WERE COUNTY IS THAT INVESTED IN THAT COUNTIES REPORTS I WOULD INVEST IN THAT WHICH WOULD ACTUALLY BE PUNISHED ESSENTIALLY. BECAUSE THEY WERE COLLECTING ALAS DELINQUENT DADS AND SO THEY WERE ABLE TO RECOVER LESSEN THEIR COSTS. JUST IT THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR PRESENTATION I'M JUST TO PAY BACK ON ON ASSEMBLYMEMBER CORKS -- COMMENTS -- YOU KNOW OF THIS SORT OF FIFTY FUNDS -- THE SPECIFIC ONES SAID ASSEMBLYMEMBER CORK APPOINTED OUT. OF THEIR TOTAL BUDGET HOW MUCH OF THAT BUDGET NEED IS MET BY FINES AND FEES ARE THERE SOME OF THEM THAT ARE VERY SIGNIFICANT THAT ARE THEY'RE MET BY THIS. IT WILL VERY -- SO ON ONE SIDE UP TO A FEW YEARS AGO -- I WILL GIVE THE EXAMPLE OF POST THE THE THE FUNDS. THE DOLLARS THAT ARE USED TO SUPPORT THE PEACE OFFICER STANDARDS ON COMMISSION UP TO A FEW YEARS AGO THEY WERE SOLELY FUNDED BY FINANCIER REVENUE -- AS A KIND OF REFERENCE TO MY COMMENTS THE AMOUNT OF FINE AND HE REVENUE THAT HAS BEEN COMING AND HAS BEEN COLLECTED OVER TIME HAS BEEN DECREASING. AND SO THE STATE THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS HAD TO TAKE ACTION -- BECAUSE THEY HAD IMPLEMENTED REDUCTIONS THE STATE WASN'T AND HE WAS UNHAPPY WITH THE SERVICE LEVEL THAT WAS BEING PROVIDED AND SO ULTIMATELY THE STATE DECIDED TO PUT IN GENERAL FUND DOLLARS. THERE'S ACTUALLY PROPOSAL THIS YEAR AGAIN RELATED TO POST ANOTHER ONE KIND OF IN THAT VEIN IS THE STATE'S DNA -- LAPS AND THAT'S OPERATED BY DOJ AND SO THEY TRADITIONALLY WERE FUNDED BY KIND OF FIND FEE REVENUE AS WALL. COME ON THE FLIP SIDE THEN YOU HAVE TRIAL COURTS -- FOR EXAMPLE TRIAL COURT OPERATIONS IS FINE IF YOU'RE EVAN AS THEY GET A PORTION OF IT BUT THEY'RE ALSO SUPPORTED BY THE GENERAL FUND CIVIL FILING FEES ON THE PAN THE CIVIL SIDE. AS WELL AS THIS OUTSTANDING AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE COUNTIES IN COURTS IN TERMS OF HOW MUCH THE COUNTY IS PROVIDE TO SUPPORT THE COURTS SO DOES IT VERY -- AND IT IT SUBJECT TO KIND OF DISCUSSION IN TERMS OF WHAT ACTIONS TO TAKE. YEAH I WAS JUST WONDERING DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHY -- THE REASON BEHIND THE COMPLEXITY BASE FIND PERCENTAGES WHICH VERY FROM CITY TO CITY AND COUNTY COUNTING. I AM I AM NOT FAMILIAR WITH THE RATIONALE BEHIND THE DISTRIBUTION I THINK IT GOES BACK TO HISTORICAL TIMES I THINK MAYBE PERFORMED FOR FOR ME -- AND AS PART OF OUR RESEARCH I DON'T THINK I WAS EVER ABLE TO KIND OF ASCERTAIN SPECIFICALLY. HOW THOSE WERE ACHIEVED AND SO THERE MIGHT BE OTHERS IN THE AUDIENCE WHO HAVE BEEN AROUND HIM WHO MIGHT BE ABLE TO PROVIDE CONTEXT IS THIS QUITE COMPLICATED AND VERY SPORTY SIGNIFICANTLY? AT US. OKAY THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] SO. NO MORE QUESTIONS WE WANT TO THANK YOU. THANK YOU BOTH. AND WILL BRING ON MR -- ANTI ROLL BLISS THE PERSONAL IMPACT OF FINES AND FEES. THE USER ORGANIZER WITH THE YOUTH JUSTICE COALITION. AND YOU HAVE. ABOUT TEN MINUTES TO GET HERE YOUR STATEMENT -- THE WE HAVE A REALLY NICE SIGN. FOR JUST MOVED CLOSER AREA. MAY ARE RECORDED. LINE MONEY OF THE RECORDER NEAR RECORD. SURE COOL THANK YOU -- GOOD MORNING A MEMBERS OF THE ASSEMBLY PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE MORNING MISTER CHAIR -- THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME HERE TODAY FOR LONG ME TO SHOW MY PERSONAL TESTIMONY ON HOW CRIMINAL MINISTRY TO FEES FINES PENALTIES AN ASSESSMENT OF AFFECTED ME AND MY COMMUNITY. MY NAME IS ANTHONY ROBERT IS AND I'M YOUTH ORGANIZER WITH THE YOUTH JUSTICE COALITION ALSO KNOWN AS WHITE CASEY. TEN YEARS AGO Y. J. C. YOUTH AND FAMILIES PROCESS SUCCESSFULLY ORGANIZED WHEN A MORATORIUM ON THE BILLING OF FAMILIES WHO HAD A YOUNG PERSON AN ALLEY COUNTY PROBATION JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM. AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN WE FOUGHT WITH LOCAL PARTNERS TO END A FIFTY DOLLAR PUBLIC DEFENDER FREE AN ALLEY COUNTY AFTER THE ACLU RELEASED REPORT CONDEMNING THE PRACTICE. ALSO IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN Y. J. SHE WAS A CO SPONSOR ON SB ONE NINETY AUTHORED BY SENATOR HOLLY MITCHELL WHICH ENDED THE PRACTICE OF ASSESSING JUVENILE MINISTRY TO FEES IN CALIFORNIA. IN OCTOBER OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN WE HELP ALI COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS TO COMPLETELY ERASE NINETY MILLION DOLLARS OF JUVENILE IN JUSTICE THAT FOR FIFTY EIGHT THOUSAND FAMILIES IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY. NOW WE ARE WORKING ON LIMITING THESE BURDEN SOME FEES FOR ADULTS. FEES AND FINES FOR ADULTS AT THE LOCAL AND STATE LEVEL AT THE LOCAL LEVEL WE COORDINATE THE LET'S GET FREE LA COALITION WHICH IS CURRENTLY FIGHTING TO REPEAL FINES AND FEES AND ALL THE COUNTY AMONG OTHER THINGS. AT THE STATE LEVEL WE ARE PART OF THE DEBT FREE JUSTICE CALIFORNIA COALITION THAT IS HERE TODAY TO TESTIFY WHY AM -- FEES FINES COUNTIES IN ASSESSMENT SHOULD BE REPEALED. I WAS INVITED HERE TO SHOW THE IMPACT THEIR CRIMINAL FEES OF HAD ON ME PERSONALLY. GROWING UP MY FAMILY ALWAYS STRUGGLED. FINANCIALLY. EVEN THOUGH BOTH OF MY PARENTS WORKED FULL TIME JOBS IT WAS STILL LONG ENOUGH TO GET BY PAYCHECK TO PAYCHECK. THINGS GOT WORSE FOR MY FATHER WAS DEPORTED WHEN I WAS IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. SOON AFTER THAT WE WERE VIC DID AND LEFT HOMELESS LIVING WEEK BY WEEK OUT OF ROACH INFESTED MOTELS. MY BROTHER WHO IS IN COLLEGE BOUND SCHOOL PROGRAM AN AVID BASKETBALL PLAYER WAS ARRESTED AND SENTENCED TO PROBATION CAMP AT SIXTEEN YEARS OLD SHORTLY AFTER WE WERE AFFECTED. LUCKILY MY GRANDMOTHER TOOK US IN AND LET US LIVE WITH HER FOR YOU INTO MY MOM GOT BACK ON THEIR FEET WITH THREE CHILDREN. YEARS LATER AS A TEENAGER LIVING ON A BLOCK THAT HAD HEAVY POLICE PRESENCE AND A LACK OF RESOURCES AND OPPORTUNITIES I FOUND MYSELF GETTING CONSTANTLY STOPPED BY POLICE. PATTED DOWN AND SEARCHED WRONGFULLY BUT AGAIN DATABASE INTERESTED MULTIPLE TIMES. AS A YOUNG ADULT THINGS DID NOT CHANGE MUCH AND I EVENTUALLY ENDED UP CATCHING A FELONY CONVICTION IN TWENTY FOURTEEN AND SPEND MY TIME IN THE ALLEY COUNTY JAIL. WHEN I WAS ASSIGNED A PUBLIC DEFENDER I WAS HANDED A PIECE OF PAPER AND TOLD TO SIGN IT? BY THE ATTORNEY WAS GOING TO BE REPRESENTING ME. THEY TOLD ME THAT I HAD TO PAY FIFTY DOLLARS TO REGISTER THIS IS NOT IF I DIDN'T HAVE THE MONEY NOW THAT I COULD PAY WITHIN FIFTEEN DAYS. I WAS SHOCKED BECAUSE I ALWAYS STOP PUBLIC DEFENDERS ARE FREE BECAUSE THE US CONSTITUTION GERRY'S GUARANTEES COUNSEL FOR THE ACCUSED NO MATTER ONE'S INCOME. THIS IMMEDIATELY MADE ME DISTRUSTFUL OF MY PUBLIC COUNCIL AND EXACERBATED MY PRECONCEIVED NOTION THAT PUBLIC DEFENDERS WERE INCOMPETENT AND DIDN'T CARE FOR THE CLIENTS SOMETHING THAT I NOW KNOW. THAT COULDN'T BE FURTHER FROM THE TRUTH THAT IS WIDELY BELIEVED BY THE GENERAL PUBLIC IN PART BECAUSE THE POLICIES ACTIVE REGISTRATION FEE. MY DISTRUST LIED TO ME ARGUING WITH MY COUNSEL BECAUSE I THOUGHT THEY DIDN'T HAVE MY BEST INTEREST IN MIND. LOOKING BACK IS VERY WELL MIGHT HAVE UNDERMINED EFFECTIVE REPRESENTATION HOW MY BEHALF. IN ANY CASE I DON'T PAY THE FEE IN TIME IN THE PRIVATE COLLECTION AGENCY THE ALLEY COUNTY CONTRACTS WITH GC SERVICES SENT ME A LETTER SAYING THAT I WAS DELINQUENT AND I OWE THEM FIFTY DOLLARS. THIS JUST ADDED STRESS TO AN ALREADY INCREDIBLY STRESSFUL TIME IN MY LIFE AS MY CASE WAS SETTLED AND TIME WENT ON I RECEIVED NUMEROUS PHONE CALLS FROM GC SERVICES REMINDED ME THAT I OWE THEM MONEY. I EVENTUALLY PAID IT OFF BUT NOT BEFORE ALL THE EXTREME OCEAN ON FINANCIAL STRAIN DURING A HARD TIME IN MY LIFE. FORTUNATELY OTHER MENTIONED EARLIER ALLEY COUNTY HAS APPEALED THAT BE BUT STATE LAW STILL ALLOWS COUNTIES TO COLLECT PUBLIC DEFENDER REGISTRATION FEES AND SEVERAL BIG COUNTIES LIKE SUMMER TO DO YOU KNOW RIVERSIDE AND SAN DIEGO STILL COLLECTED. AN ACLU REPORT CITES AND EARLY AMERICAN BAR ASSOCIATION STUDY ON PUBLIC DEFENDER REGISTRATION FEES WHICH FOUND OUT OF TWENTY EIGHT JURISDICTIONS NATIONWIDE. STUDY NATIONWIDE THOSE PROGRAMS WHICH HAD DATA ON FEE COLLECTION RIGHT TO REPORTED COLLECTION RATE FROM 6220%. SO NOT ONLY DOES THIS BE SABOTAGED THE PUBLIC TRUST AND AND PUBLIC DEFENDERS BUT ALSO COMPROMISES EFFECTIVE REPRESENTATION WILL NOT. EVEN BEING COLLECTED AT A RATE THAT IS SUFFICIENT TO OFFSET COSTS WHICH IS ITS INTENDED GOAL. AFTER I WAS RELEASED I WAS PUT ON FELONY PROBATION FOR THREE YEARS WHEN I WENT IN TO CHECK MY MY P. O. IMMEDIATELY AFTER MY RELEASE I WAS IN FOR ANOTHER SHOT JUST AS MUCH OF THAT TIME WHEN I WAS HANDED A PIECE OF PAPER THAT TOLD ME OUT. FIFTY DOLLARS FOR SUPPOSEDLY FREE PUBLIC DEFENDER. THIS TIME I PUT MY P. ALL TOLD ME THAT I WOULD HAVE TO LOSE BEFORE MY PROBATION TERM WAS UP AND THAT THE MINIMUM MONTHLY PAYMENT WAS GOING TO BE FIFTY DOLLARS. I CANNOT BELIEVE THAT I HAD TO PAY FOR MY OWN PROBATION SUPERVISION A PROGRAM THAT DIDN'T HELP ME FIND A JOB OR GET IN A SCHOOL OR FINE HOUSING. I HAD JUST GOT BACK BECAUSE SORRY I JUST GOT A JAIL WITH THE FAMILY ON MY RECORD AND NO MONEY TO MY NAME. MY OLD JOB WOULD NOT TAKE ME BACK BECAUSE OF MY RECORD AND I COULDN'T FIND ANY STABLE EMPLOYMENT. I WAS LUCKY IF I FOUND A JOB ASSIGNMENT FOR A WHOLE WEEK. I WENT BACK TO COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND KEPT DRIVING TOWARD MY GOAL COMMUNITY A UNIVERSITY IN OBTAINING MY BACHELOR'S DEGREE. I DO NOT MAKE A PAYMENT TO PROBATION FOR AN ENTIRE YEAR AND ALTHOUGH I HAVE NOT HAD ANY PLEASE CONTACT AND CHECK THEM WITH MY PO ONE TIME EVERY MONTH THEY STILL SENT ME A LETTER SAYING THAT IF I TO MAKE A PAYMENT WITHIN TWO WEEKS. THAT I WOULD HAVE A PROBATION HEARING AND I COULD POSSIBLY BE VIOLATED AND THROWN BACK IN JAIL. THIS IS A PARTICULARLY ROUGH TIME FROM FROM MY FOUNDED WE HAD RECENTLY BEEN FORCED OUT OF OUR HOME AGAIN BECAUSE THE OWNER SOLD IT. WE WERE BACK AT MY GRANDMA'S AGAIN. INVESTORS OVERTAKING US IN TWICE THERE WAS THREE PEOPLE LIVING IN A FIVE HUNDRED SQUARE FOOT AFFORDABLE HOUSING APARTMENT FOR LOW INCOME SENIOR CITIZENS. MY LIVING SPACE WAS IN THE CORNER OF THE ROOM IN THE IN THE LEAD IN THE CORNER OF THE LIVING ROOM AND ALL I HAD WAS A ROLL OUT BAD AND A SMALL DRESSER. HOWEVER PROBATIONTHOUGHT WOULD BE NICE IF I COULD PAY THEM FIFTY DOLLARS EVERY MONTH FOR SERVICES THEY DON'T EVEN PROVIDE TO SUPPORT ME. I VISITED MY P. O. AND TOLD ME THAT I WAS IN SCHOOL RECEIVING GENERAL RELIEF BENEFITS AND THAT I COULD NOT AFFORD THE PAYMENTS. SHE TOLD ME THAT I COULD RECEIVE A FINANCIAL VALUATION IF I BROUGHT IN ALL MY PROOF OF INCOME. WHEN I CAME IN FOR THE EVALUATION? HOW IS NOT RECEIVING FINANCIAL AID BECAUSE I HAD TAKEN TOO MANY UNITS FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGE SO ALL I WAS RECEIVING WAS TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY DOLLARS IN FOOD STAMPS AND ABOUT TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS CASH A MONTH FROM G. R.? SOMEHOW PROBATION CALCULATED THAT I HAD THE ABILITY TO PAY HALF THE ORIGINAL FEET TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS TOTAL TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS. A MINIMUM MONTHLY PAYMENTS. THE ONLY REASON I WAS SURVIVING AT THE TIME WITH BECAUSE MY GRANDMA WAS LETTING ME LIVE THERE FOR FREE. AN ALLEY COUNTY PROBATION THE BUDGET INCREASED HAS INCREASED BY ALMOST FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN THE LAST ELEVEN YEARS ALTHOUGH CRIME IS JOB TO HISTORIC LOWS IN LOS ANGELES. THEIR BUDGET IS CLOSE TO ONE BILLION DOLLARS AND YET THEY STILL CHARGE PROBATIONERS FOR THEIR OWN SUPERVISION. BY GOOD FORTUNE SHORTLY AFTER THAT EVALUATION I FOUND EMPLOYMENT MY BROTHER'S JOB AND WAS ABLE TO MAKE THE PAYMENTS UNTIL MY PROBATION WAS TERMINATED. NONE THE LESS IF I HAD NOT HAD THE TREMENDOUS AN AMAZING SUPPORT FROM MY FAMILY. MOST LIKELY WOULD HAVE BEEN VIOLATED AND SENT BACK TO JAIL FOR NOT BEING ABLE TO PAY. PROBATION NEVER OFFERED ME BUS PASSES ACCESS TO COMPUTERS OR LIVE COUNSELING. IT WITH MY STRUGGLING FAMILY WHO PROVIDED THAT TYPE OF SUPPORT. SADLY EVERY DAY THOUSANDS HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS SPACES HELPLESS SITUATION. AND DO NOT HAVE THE SUPPORT THAT I DID. CRIMINAL ADMINISTRATIVE FEES AND FINES ARE NEXT ARE AN ECONOMIC DRAIN ON BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITIES AS WE ARE THE ONES THAT ARE OVERWHELMINGLY REPRESENTED IN THE SYSTEM DUE TO RACIAL BIAS AT EVERY STAGE OF THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. PEOPLE EXITING THE SYSTEM ARE OFTEN CHARGE THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS IN ADMINISTRATIVE FEES. AND A SEPARATE EXPERIENCE FROM THOSE ALREADY MENTIONED I WAS CONVICTED OF A MISDEMEANOR THAT CARRY TO BASE FINE OF THREE HUNDRED AND NINETY DOLLARS WHICH IS ALREADY ON AFFORDABLE FOR ME. BUT AFTER FEES PENALTIES IN ASSESSMENTS I ENDED UP PAYING OVER FIFTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS. THESE FEES ARE NOT JUST ABOUT COLLECTING REVENUE BUT ABOUT EXCESSIVE PUNISHMENT SINCE PEOPLE HAVE ALREADY SERVE TIME PAID FINES OR FACE OTHER CONSEQUENCES. FIND IN FEES DO NOT ENHANCE PUBLIC SAFETY. RATHER THEY MAKE IT EXTREMELY DIFFICULT FOR SUCCESSFUL REENTRY AND LEAD TO RECIDIVISM. CALIFORNIA IS THE RICHEST THING IN THE NATION IN THE FIFTY FIFTY RICHEST ECONOMY IN THE ENTIRE WORLD. YEAH IT IS HOME TO THE LARGEST PRISON SYSTEM ON THE PLANET THE LARGEST PROBATION DEPARTMENT AND LARGEST JAIL SYSTEM IN THE WORLD. AND IN MY HOME IN LOS ANGELES IS BASICALLY HOME TO THE LARGEST CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM IN THE WORLD AND IT IN TRAPS FAR TOO MANY PEOPLE ESPECIALLY LOW INCOME RESIDENTS AND PEOPLE OF COLOR. LET US HAVE A FAIR CHANCE BY ELIMINATING FEES FINES PENALTIES AND ASSESSMENT AND ALLOW US TO ENJOY ALL THE GREAT THINGS THAT CALIFORNIA HAS TO OFFER. NOT JUSTICE PRISONS AND JAILS AND THAT AND IT'S FINE COLLECTION AGENCIES. I RECOMMEND FOR THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE THAT YOU MOVE BEYOND CREATING AN ABILITY TO PAY MECHANISM FOR FEES AND FINES WHICH AS EVIDENCED BY MY OWN EXPERIENCE WITH PROBATION DOES NOT WORK. AND STAND FOR JUSTICE BY REPEALING THEM COMPLETELY ANY RACING ALL PAST THAT -- TO THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER ROVER SENT THANK YOU FOR GIVING US COMMITTEE -- A FACE OF THIS IN A REAL LIFE EXAMPLE YOU WERE VERY ELOQUENT THANK YOU APPRECIATE IT -- BOOKS ARE LIMITED [inaudible] IT. OKAY ONE QUICK QUESTION. SO I'D THANK YOU FOR YOUR HONEST CONCISE AND CLEAR TESTIMONY I AM I JUST WANTED I HAD A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS SO YOU FEES ARE LINKED TO THE OFFENSE AND THEN THE FINDER THE ADMINISTRATIVE COURTS. I'M AND THE COSTS -- WE DID ANY MEANS TESTING HAPPEN. WELL FOR IN THE VERY VERY VERY BEGINNING OF YEAR EXPERIENCE AN ENTRY JUST FOR SOMEONE TO SAY EXACTLY. YOU KNOW HOW MUCH ARE YOU EARNING HOW MUCH CAN YOU PAY TO DO THAT BEFORE HAND NEVER. DID THIS IMPACT YOUR CREDIT -- I THOUGHT IT HAD AND I CHECK MY CREDIT REPORT BEFORE THIS HEARING AND I DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING THAT WENT ON TO MY CREDIT REPORT BUT IT DOES GO TO A COLLECTION AGENCY SO I THOUGHT IT HAD BUT I DON'T BELIEVE IT DID. NOT SURE AND WAS INTEREST. DID YOU HAVE TO PAY INTEREST. ON THE THE FOR THE DON'T HAVE TO PAY INTEREST BUT FOR EVERY LIKE THERE IS LATE FEES ATTACHED TO IT SOULS ALMOST LIKE. THIS RIGHT WERE YOU EVER I KNOW THIS IS BUT IT ALL GOES TO THE SAME THING. WERE YOU EVER INVITED TO NEGOTIATE DOWN THE COSTS I WAS NEVER INVITED AFTER THE YEAR WHEN I GOT THE LETTER SAYING I HAD A PROBATION HEARING THAT I COULD BE VIOLATED BECAUSE I HAVEN'T MADE A PAYMENT -- I WENT AND SEEN MY P. I. P. O. IMMEDIATELY AND TOLD I CAN MAKE THIS AND I DON'T WANT TO BE VIOLATED I CAN I WANNA GO BACK TO JAIL. WHAT CAN I DO AND SO WE CAN HAVE A FINANCIAL VALUATION HIM THAT WAS A YEAR INTO MY PROBATION KNOWING THAT I WAS ON ON G. ARE? GOING TO SCHOOL NOT COLLECTING FINANCIALLY AT THE TIME SHE EVEN OFFER ME THAT I HAD TO BRING IT UP TO HER AND THEN -- I WAS ABLE -- TO NOT EVEN NEGOTIATE HOSES TOLD THAT THEY WOULD BE CUT IN HALF AND I STILL HAD TO PAY A TWENTY FIVE DOLLAR MINIMUM MONTHLY PAYMENT BUT ULTIMATELY. YOUR PROBATION WAS NOT DISMISSED UNTIL YOU PAID EVERYTHING DOWN TO ZERO YEAH YEAH AND I WAS SOMETHING HANGING OVER MY HEAD. THANK YOU THANK YOU. AGAIN THANK YOU FOR FOR YOUR TESTIMONY THANK YOU MISTER. TO AND CAN WE BRING UP THE ALAMEDA INS AND SAN FRANCISCO COUNTIES WHO ELIMINATED. THE ASSESSMENTS RELATED TO PROBATION SUPERVISION OUT AN ATTORNEY COSTS. BRANDON WOODS CARE BAKER. JEFF APACHE AND JOSE CISNEROS YEAH YES -- GOOD MORNING -- TO THE COMMITTEE I THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING US TO COME AND SHARE SOME COMMENTS REGARD TO HOW WE WERE ABLE TO ELIMINATE PUBLIC DEFENDER FEES. AND THE BASIC VERSION COSTS IN ALAMEDA COUNTY. I'M GOING TO FOCUS ON PUBLIC DEFENDER FEES AND ASSISTANT CHIEF PROBATION OFFICER KAREN BREAK WILL FOCUS ON THE PROVISIONS OF THIS [inaudible] ABSOLUTELY TRUE. FROM THAT IS THE WAY THE SYSTEM IS SET UP. AND THAT IS A HUGE HUGE FAILING. YOU SAW MY BIO -- DONE THE FIRST AFRICAN AMERICAN. PUBLIC DEFENDER ALAMEDA COUNTY I'M CURRENTLY THE ONLY CHIEF AFRICAN AMERICAN PUBLIC DEFENDER IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SO WHEN IT COMES TO SEEING THE WAY TO SYSTEM IMPACTS MEANS OF COLOR. THE WAY. PRISONS IMPACT MEANS OF COLOR POLICING THIS DEBT. THAT WE HAVE THAT. IS BEARS DOWN ON A COMMUNITY OF COLOR WE HAVE TO DO BETTER. WE MUST TO BETTER AND I JUST WANT TO MAKE A STATEMENT I APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS FROM THE SAME WITH REGARD TO HOW RACE. UNDERMINES HIS WHOLE SYSTEM HERE. AND WE JUST NEED TO BE MINDFUL THAT AS WHEN THEY GET OUT THERE AND THANK MISTER WILL BASE BECAUSE HIS TESTIMONY WAS VERY -- IMPACTFUL AND IN SOME WAYS I REALLY WE STOP RIGHT THERE ON WE COULD STOP RIGHT THERE SO. I MEAN FOR TO TALK ABOUT THIS PROCESS I NEED TO TALK TO YOU FIRST ABOUT HOW SOME OF THE COMES THE PUBLIC FROM THE CLIENT. IN ALAMEDA COUNTY AND I MOST OF STATE OF FIRST THING THAT HAPPENED IS SOMEONE'S ARRESTED. AND IF THEY CAN -- FROM THAT POINT THERE CHEN BE REFERRED TO A PUBLIC DEFENDER -- THEY CAN BE SENT TO US EITHER IN CUSTODY OR OUT OF CUSTODY AND THERE'S A DETERMINATION MADE WITH REGARD TO WHETHER THEY CAN AFFORD TO PAY FOR THEIR COUNTLESS SOME SORT OF FINANCIAL ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS -- AND NOW COUNTY WE GET OURSELVES AND IF SOMEONE CANNOT AFFORD TO PAY FOR COUNCIL WITHIN REPRESENT THEM [inaudible] AND I'M. THE REAL PROBLEM BEGINS AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE CASE ONCE THE CASE IS OVER. AT THAT POINT IN TIME DOWN A COUNTY THE PERSON'S REFER TO THE FATTER HEARING OFFICER THAT PERSON HAS BEEN GIVEN THE AUTHORITY BY THE COURT IN THE COUNTY DETERMINE WHETHER SOMEONE CAN PAY FORTIFIED IN FEES. AND THE TERM WHAT THEY'RE FINDING FEES WILL BE. SO IN ALAMEDA COUNTY. OUR FINES AND FEES FOR ATTORNEY SERVICE THE BASED UPON THE TYPE OF CRIME TO COMMIT WERE TO MISDEMEANOR OR FELONY. FOR MISDEMEANOR. IT'S A HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS. FOR THREE OR FOUR APPEARANCES ON A CASE. DO HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR FOUR MORE APPEARANCES. POINT IN FIFTY DOLLARS THERE'S A MOTION OR TRIAL AND THEN SEVENTY FIVE DOLLAR BASIN EACH APPEARANCE AFTER THAT RELITIGATE APPEARANCE. SO FOR FELONIES IT'S DUE HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR A CASE THREE ARE A FEW APPEARANCES FIVE HUNDRED FOR FOR A MORE APPEARANCES. FIVE HER DOLLARS FOR MOTION. THAT HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE DOLLARS FOR EACH ADDITIONAL SESSION RELATED LITIGATION IN THE TRIAL A MOTION. SO ONE OF MY LOWER JUST FINISHED UP A TRIAL -- LAST WEEK WAS A VERY QUICK TRIAL ON A FELONY CASE NOT SERIOUS CASE FOR A GOOD RESULT. UNFIT TO THE LESSON OF THIS YEAR'S CASE. FOR A CLIENT WOULD HAVE TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS JUST IN ATTORNEY'S FEES [inaudible] THAT'S IT. NOT COULDN'T PROBATION SUPERVISION ACOSTA COURT COST.

AND I'M SORRY AGAIN THAT APPRECIATE HOW WRAPPED UP -- BASED ON A RANDOM SAMPLING ABOUT HUNDRED FIFTH ABOUT CLIENTS. THE AVERAGE INCOME WAS NINE HUNDRED AND SIX SIX DOLLARS A MONTH. SO IT IS CLEAR OUR CLIENTS CANNOT AFFORD COUNSEL. OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS IT AVERAGE OF THE FEES WERE COLLECTING. ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS. HER. NOT TO IN TWENTY TWENTY THOUSAND I'M SORRY -- INTERNEES FEES A YEAR. THAT WAS THE COST OF ONE ATTORNEY. SO WE WERE ASSESSING FEES IN ASSESSING PEAS IN ASSESSING FEES IN THE RESULTS WE GET BACK WE'RE NOT VERY HIGH. SO I WAS PLEASED THAT TO A COLLABORATION. PROBATION. EFFORT LED BY EAST BAY CAMILLUS AND WHO HERE FROM. AND THE FEET AND LATER ON THAT WE WERE THEY ABLE TO LIMIT A FEES -- THIS WAS DONE TO A CLUB AND IT'S SO IMPORTANT TO LISTEN TO THE VOICE OF THE COMMUNITY BECAUSE THEY ARE THE ONES BEING IMPACTED IN HER. BY AS MUCH OF FEES SO I KNOW WHEN OVER THE THANK YOU. THANK YOU NECKS. THANK YOU -- BRENDAN I AM GOING TO GO ON SCRIPT NOT HAVING FLIGHT YOUR PUBLIC SPEAKING SKILLS. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I'M KAREN BAKER AND THE ASSISTANT CHIEF PROBATION OFFICER IT'S MY PLEASURE TO BE HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF CHIEF WINDY STILL -- TO DISCUSS THIS IMPORTANT TOPIC AND ALAMEDA COUNTIES DELIBERATION PROCESS FOR DECIDING TO IT AND PROBATION FEES. SHE STILL APOLOGIZES FOR HER INABILITY TO BE HERE TODAY SHE'S HOSTING A TWO DAY JUVENILE JUSTICE FORM IN ALAMEDA COUNTY TODAY AND TOMORROW. OUR BOARD OF SUPERVISORS APPROVED RESOLUTION NUMBER TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN DASH SIXTY SEVEN ON DECEMBER FOURTH REPEALING A NUMBER OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE FEES INCLUDING PROBATION FEES. THE RESOLUTION TOOK EFFECT ON JANUARY FOURTH. TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN ALAMEDA COUNTY AS YOU MAY KNOW INDEED JUVENILE FEES IN JULY TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN THEY WERE ELIMINATED STATEWIDE IN. TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN ALAMEDA COUNTY HAS NOW TAKEN THE IMPORTANT STEP IN CRIMINAL JUSTICE FEES FOR ADULTS AND IS CHARGING OUT THEIR OUTSTANDING DEBT JOIN THE CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO IN THIS ENDEAVOR. TO REMOVE BARRIERS FOR THE JUSTICE INVOLVED. AS OF LAST WEEK OUR CENTRAL COLLECTIONS REPORTS THAT BETWEEN PROBATION AND PUBLIC DEFENDER CLIENTS. NEARLY ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY EIGHT THOUSAND INDIVIDUAL ACCOUNTS WILL BE DISCHARGED FOR A TOTAL OF ALMOST FORTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS IN DEBT. BOOK FOR PROPOSING THE FEEL IN THE NATION THE GOVERNMENTAL PARTNERS GOT TOGETHER TO REVIEW OUR PAST COLLECTION PRACTICES. AND OUR ABILITY TO SUSTAIN SERVICES IF THERE WERE A LOSS OF THIS REVENUE. FOR PROBATION WE LOOKED AT THAT THESE OUTSTANDING BALANCES FROM FISCAL YEAR EIGHTEEN WE FOUND THAT THE OUTSTANDING PROBATION FEES THAT WERE DO AVERAGED ABOUT TWENTY ONE POINT THREE MILLION IN THAT STAYED FAIRLY CONSTANT OVER THAT FIVE YEAR PERIOD. AND WHILE WE WERE COLLECTED ON AVERAGE -- SAID ABOUT OUTSTANDING DEBT A YEAR. THIS DEBT HAD ACCUMULATED OVER TIME DESPITE PROBATION IS USE OF A SLIDING SCALE FEE IN DETERMINING AN OFFENDER'S ABILITY TO PAY AND ADJUSTING FEES ACCORDINGLY. PROBATION ALSO LOOKED AT ITS USE OF THIS REVENUE SOURCE THE REVENUE WAS MEANT TO FUND THE COSTS OF ADULT SUPERVISION AND DRUG LAB TESTS AND FEES. BUT THE AMOUNT COLLECTED ANNUALLY HAS ONLY BEEN BETWEEN FIVE AND SEVEN HUNDRED AT THE MOST EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR IT'S NEVER FUNDED THOSE ENDEAVORS. AND THE COUNTY'S GENERAL FUND HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE MAIN FUNDING SOURCE. WE DETERMINED THAT THE COST TO OUR CLIENTS WAS MUCH GREATER THAN THE LOW REVENUE WE WERE ABLE TO RECOUP. EVERY COUNTY NEEDS TO MAKE THAT DETERMINATION FOR THEMSELVES BECAUSE DIFFERENT DIFFERENT JURISDICTIONS HAVE DIFFERENT FUNDING CHALLENGES. BUT OUR COUNTY ESTIMATED THE AVERAGE REVENUE RECEIVED OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS BETWEEN PROBATION PUBLIC DEFENDER AND SHERIFF THESE. WAS ABOUT ONE POINT FOUR FIVE MILLION. SO WORKING COLLABORATIVE COLLABORATIVELY WITH THE AUDITOR THE COUNTY ADMINISTRATOR'S OFFICE THE PUBLIC DEFENDER THE SHERIFF AND WITH THE UNANIMOUS SUPPORT UNANIMOUS SUPPORT AND APPROVAL OF OUR BOARD WE WERE ABLE TO ELIMINATE THOSE FEES. IT WAS A PRIORITY FOR THE AB ONE OH NINE COMMUNITY CORRECTIONS PARTNERSHIP EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE AND OUR BOARD. THEIR FOR WE MADE THE DECISION TO USE EIGHTY ONE OH NINE GROWTH FUNDS TO ENSURE WE CAN CONTINUE THE SERVICES WITHOUT RELYING ON THAT CRIMINAL JUSTICE BE REVENUE. SHE STILL CAME TO ALAMEDA COUNTY IN AUGUST OF TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN IN HER VISION HAS INCLUDED TO END -- THESE FEES WHICH ARE RE ENTRY BARRIERS. ED AS DISCUSSED IN THE PAPER THAT'S INCLUDED IN THE LINK TO YOUR HEARING TO DEBT CRIMINAL JUSTICE FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS IN THE BARRIERS TO RE ENTRY THEY CREATE. SHE WANT ME TO JUST GIVE A COUPLE CLOSE TO YOU FROM THAT. SHACKLED TO DEBT EXPLORES THE TREND IN CRIMINAL JUSTICE NATION WIDE OF SHIFTING THE COST TO ADMINISTER CRIMINAL JUSTICE PROGRAMS TO THE JUSTICE INVOLVED. BY INCREASING THE AMOUNT TO NUMBERS OF FINES FEES AND SURCHARGES THEY ASSESS. THESE FEES ONLY EXACERBATE AN ALREADY CONSIDERABLE LISTA BARRIERS THE JUSTICE INVOLVED FACE POSTED CAR SERRATION. THE PAPER DETAILS THAT IN CALIFORNIA SIXTEEN DIFFERENT STATUTES CODIFY TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY NINE SEPARATE COURT FINES FEES FOR PICTURES SURCHARGES AND PENALTY ASSESSMENTS THAT CAN BE ASSESSED. MORE THAN 85% ON PROBATION OR PAROLE ARE REQUIRED TO PAY SUPERVISION FEES FINES COURT COSTS OR RESTITUTION IN ORDER TO REMAIN FREE FROM FURTHER SANCTIONS. SHE STILL PUTS PAPER NAMES FOR WAYS THESE FEES HAVE RECREATED. BARRIERS TO RE ENTRY. FIRST COURTS HAVE THE DISCRETION TO WAIVE OR MODIFY MONETARY SANCTIONS BUT THEIR RESEARCH FOUND THAT FEW CONSIDERED WHETHER PEOPLE HAD THE FINANCIAL RESOURCES. TO MEET THE OBLIGATIONS BEING IMPOSED. FURTHER FEW HAD MECHANISMS IN PLACE TO REDUCE BEES CONTENTION UPON PEOPLE'S FINANCIAL ABILITY TO PAY. SECOND YOU STAYS PROVIDE ADEQUATE PAYMENT PLANS TO ALLOW THOSE WHO ARE INDIGENT TO PAY DOWN THEIR DEBTS OVER TIME. IT IF THEY DID THERE WAS A FEE IN ORDER TO APPLY. THIRD JURISDICTIONS COULD BE PLACE FEES WITH COMMUNITY SERVICE WHICH IS ANOTHER WAY TO GET BACK YET MOST DO NOT OFFERED AS AN ALTERNATIVE OR PROVIDE LIMITED OPTIONS. AND FINALLY THESE FEES ARE ROUTINELY SUBJECT TO LATE FEES THESE FOR PAYMENT PLANS AND FEES FOR DEBT COLLECTION. CONSEQUENTLY THE JUSTICE INVOLVED IN OFTEN THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS WHO FREQUENTLY SHOULDER THE BURDEN OF THE LEGAL DEBT. CAN BE SADDLED WITH THESE OBLIGATIONS FOR DECADES. FOR MANY CRIMINAL JUSTICE THAT CAN TRIGGER A CASCADE OF DEBILITATING HAUNTS CONSEQUENCES MANY OF WHICH UNDERMINE POSTING CAR SERRATION REENTRY GOALS SUCH AS FINDING STABLE HOUSING TRANSPORTATION EMPLOYMENT. TOOK IN CLOSE AND I'LL JUST LEAVE YOU WITH THIS AND ALAMEDA COUNTY THE ANTICIPATED REVENUE LOSS AS A WHOLE WAS ONE POINT FOUR FIVE MILLION A YEAR. FOR ANY CUMULATED DEBT OF FORTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS [inaudible] THANK YOU. THANK YOU. X.. MORNING OF MY NAME IS JEFF ADACHI I. SERVIZI ELECTED PUBLIC DEFENDERS HAVE TO SCHOOL COUNTY. I'VE SERVED IN THAT POSITION FOR SIXTEEN YEARS AND I'VE BEEN A DEPUTY PUBLIC DEFENDER FOR THIRTY THREE YEARS -- THANK YOU -- CHAIR JONES SAWYER FOR HOLDING THIS HEARING. MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE. ALLOWING ME TO SPEAK. THIS IS A CHANCE FOR YOU TO MAKE HISTORY. IF YOU PASS A BILL LIMITING. UNNECESSARY CRIMINAL FINES AND FEES. CALIFORNIA WILL BE THE FIRST. STATE IN THE NATION TO DO THIS. THIS IS ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL. TO DO PROCESS TO EVERYTHING THAT WE SAY ABOUT OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM. LAST -- WHAT IT TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND THE DAY BEFORE THANKSGIVING I WAS WORKING THE FRONT DESK WE? HAVE REDUCING LETTING OUR EMPLOYEES GOAL EARLY. IN A YOUNG MAN CAME IN. ANY SAID IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU CAN DO TO HELP ME I SAID WHAT CAN HELP YOU NEED. HE SAYS I IT WAS SINGLE FILE IT'S A WORKING TWO JOBS. THE TAKEN SEVEN HUNDRED DOLLARS OUT OF MY CHECK EVERY MONTH IS OR HOW MUCH YOU MAKE. IS A MAKE ABOUT FIFTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS. THIS IS A YOUNG MAN WHO'D BEEN CONVICTED OF A FELONY. IT WAS SETTLED WITH THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS WITH THE FEES REMEMBER TALKING A RESTITUTION NOT TALKING ABOUT A FINE ASSOCIATED. WITH A PARTICULAR CRIME DO THINGS FOR LIKE COURT CONSTRUCTION FEES. AND IT WAS CAUSING HIM TO SINCE WE HAVE A SECOND JOB IN ORDER TO SUPPORT HIS KIDS. I TOLD AT THAT TIME A SAID ARE TRESOR JOSE CISNEROS AND I HAVE STARTED A WORKING COMMITTEE ALONG WITH DONNA MANDEL OUR POLICY ANALYST IN THE OFFICE TO TRY TO ADDRESS THIS. WE SPENT ABOUT A YEAR. LOOKING AT THIS PROBLEM. TO MY OFFICE REPRESENTS ABOUT TWENTY THREE THOUSAND PEOPLE A YEAR CHARGED WITH THE CRIME. 8290% OF CRIMINAL DEFENDANTS OR POOR. THEY DON'T HAVE MONEY TO PAY AND YOU KNOW MOST FOR PEOPLE OF COLOR -- THIS THE OTHER TENER 20% ARE JUST BARELY GETTING BY. MORE THAN A THIRD OF OUR CLIENTS ARE HOMELESS MANY HAVE MENTAL ILLNESS. AND IN SAN FRANCISCO AFRICAN AMERICANS IN OUR LESSON 5% OF THE POPULATION YET 50%. OF THE FOLKS WHO ARE IN THE SYSTEM AND OUR SERVER WITH THESE FINES. WOULD SIMPLY GUITAR JAIL OR PROBATION THEY CAN BE HIT WITH THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS. WITH THE PORT FEES AT THEY HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO WAY OF PAYING. WE HAVE A CLEAN SLATE PROGRAM WHICH IS EXCELLENT A PROGRAM. WHICH ALLOWS PEOPLE TO CLEAR THE RECORDS THE UNEMPLOYMENT ABOUT IN MOST EARNED ABOUT THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR IF YOU CAN IMAGINE SAN FRANCISCO. IN THE COURT WILL NOT CLEAR RECORD UNTIL ALL THE FIGHTS AND FEES ARE PAID. TO A STUDY THAT CENTER THE AVERAGE POST INCARCERATION DEBT. IS MORE THAN THIRTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS. AND IT'S NOT ONLY THE FORMAL INCARCERATED PERSON HAS TO PAY THE DEBT IT'S USUALLY FAMILY MEMBERS AND WOMEN. WHO THEMSELVES ARE TRYING TO GET BY COURSE SETTLE WITH THIS DEBT? ONE CLIENT OF OURS NICOLE IS A SINGLE MOTHER. OF TWO CHILDREN SHE'S WORKING TWO MINIMUM WAGE JOBS TO SUPPORT OUR KIDS IN TO PAY RECORD FEES. EVEN LOWER INCOME WAS BARELY ABOVE THE POVERTY LEVEL SHE STOOD SEVERAL HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH TAKEN FROM A PAYCHECK IN ORDER TO COVER THE DEBT. THIS IS TEN YEARS AFTER SHE FINISHED HER SENTENCE. SHE WANTED TO GO BACK TO SCHOOL TO BECOME A CERTIFIED NURSING ASSISTANT BUT SHE WAS NOT ABLE TO GET LICENSED ISSUE SHE GOT THE CONVICTION EXPUNGED. AND THAT RECORD PAY THE DEBT. MY STAFF RESEARCH RECORD FEES THAT OUR CLIENTS ARE BEING CHARGE IS. A PUBLIC DEFENDER A WOOD SAID WITHIN A FIVE FORTY FIVE FEES BEING CHARGED JUST IN SAN FRANCISCO. THERE WERE OVER TWO HUNDRED STATEWIDE FEES BOTH OF THESE FEES ARE FOR THE PURPOSE OF REVENUE GENERATION. IN THE BEING CHARGED SOME OF THE POOREST PEOPLE. INSTEAD OF JUST WHO IDENTIFY TEN FEES ARE AUTHORIZED BY THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS THE CASA PROBATION. EIGHTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS UP FRONT TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH FOR THREE YEARS. HE SAID REPORT A HUNDRED FIFTY BUCKS. BOOKING THREE HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE DOLLARS ELECTRONIC MONITORING GET THIS HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS JUST TO SIGN UP. IN THIRTY FIVE DOLLARS A DAY. A COLLECTION RATE ON COURT FEES WITH LESS THAN. EVEN AFTER FIVE YEARS OF HOUNDING OUR CLIENTS BY COLLECTION AGENCIES AND HAVING THEIR WAGES CARS. SOME OF THE DEPARTMENTS. THAT THESE WERE EARMARKED FOR DIDN'T EVEN BUDGET FOR THE MONEY BECAUSE THEY KNEW IT WASN'T THERE. ONCE WE MADE THIS RESEARCH PUBLIC THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS VOTED LAST YEAR TO ELIMINATE ALL CRIMINAL JUSTICE FEES IT HAD AUTHORITY OVER. THE SHERIFF ELIMINATE TO FEES IN HER DEPARTMENT. BEFORE THE BOOK BOARDED EVEN VOTED. THE BOARD ASKED THE COURT TO WEIGH THIRTY TWO MILLION IN OUTSTANDING DEBT THIS IS PASSED. SO LOSE RETROACTIVE FOR TWENTY THOUSAND PEOPLE. THIS IS MONEY THAT WAS UNLIKELY TO BE COLLECTED ANYWAY. WE VAST WITHIN S. WHY NOT MAKE THE FEE SUBJECT TO BUILD YOU TO PAY. RATHER THAN ELIMINATING THEM. I BELIEVE THAT ELIMINATION IS ONLY SOLUTION. FOR CRIMINAL JUSTICE DEBT FOR SEVERAL REASONS ONE ABILITY TO PAY PROVISIONS ARE ALREADY IN THE LAW. BUT IN MOST CASES THE COURTS DON'T BOTHER TO MAKE THAT DETERMINATION. AND THERE'S NOT A HEARING -- YOU KNOW MANY OF THE FEES A WHEEL LEMONADE WERE SUBJECT TO QUALITY IT FROM THE SPEEDS ARE TURNED OVER TO A COLLECTION AGENCY TYPICALLY HAVE TO DEFEND IT DOESN'T PAY. AND THAT'S WHAT THEY CONSIDER ABILITY TO PAY. 8290% OF CRIMINAL DEFENDANTS ARE ALREADY DETERMINED TO BE INDIGENT ANYWAY THAT'S WHY THEY HAVE A PUBLIC DEFENDER. DEBILITY TO PAY DETERMINATION HAS ALREADY BEEN DONE SO IT'S NOT NECESSARY. AND ALMOST NO ONE CAN AFFORD THESE FEES. EVEN THE 15220% OF FEES THAT ARE COLLECTED INTER SQUEEZE OUT OF PEOPLE UNDER DURESS. NEGATIVELY IMPACT THEIR ABILITY TO MOVE FORWARD. FINALLY BECAUSE A COLLECTION LATEST SOLO THE AMOUNT THE COUNTY SPENT ON COLLECTING THESE FEES. IS A SIGNIFICANT PART OF WHAT IS COLLECTED. TRULY IMPLEMENTING THE ABILITY TO PAY WOULD INCREASE THE ADMINISTRATIVE COST. INSTANCE YOU KNOW MOST PEOPLE CAN'T AFFORD TO PAY YOU SPENDING A LOT OF MONEY JUST TO FIND THAT RARE DEFENDED WHO CAN PAY. THIS IS NOT COST EFFECTIVE IN ITS INFANCY IT INEFFICIENT USE OF GOVERNMENT RESOURCES. OWN IN WITH A CITATION FROM A HIS ORANGE COUNTY PROBATION DEPARTMENT. TWENTY SIXTEEN QUOTE RAISING MONEY FOR GOVERNMENT TO LAW ENFORCEMENT WHATEVER THE SOURCE PARKING TICKETS POLICE ISSUE CITATIONS COURT IMPOSED FEES BILL FOR COURT APPOINTED LAWYERS PUNITIVE FINES INCARCERATION CHARGES SUPERVISION FEES AND MORE. CAN LAY A DEBT TRAP FOR THE POOR THIS IS CHARLES DICKENS SAID. WHEN A MINOR OFFENSE PRODUCES A DEBT THAT DEBT ALONG WITH THE INTENDED COURT APPEARANCE CAN LEAD TO A LOSS OF EMPLOYMENT? OR SHELTER COMPOUNDING INTEREST. YET MORE LEGAL ACTION IN AN EVER EXPANDING FINANCIAL BURDEN THE CYCLE IS PREDICTABLE IN IS COUNTERPRODUCTIVE. AS IT IS INTRACTABLE THIS IS YOUR CHANCE TO CHANGE THAT. CALIFORNIA HAS ONE OF THE WORST INCOMING QUALITY IN THE NATION AS MR ROLE THE SAYS IT DOES NOT HAVE TO FUND ITS BUDGET ON THE BACKS OF OUR MOST VULNERABLE. RESIDENTS MANY OF WHOM ARE ALREADY FACING UNEMPLOYMENT FOR HOMELESSNESS. THIS IS THE MOST REGRESSIVE FORM OF TAXATION IMAGINABLE IT FURTHER EXACERBATES WEALTHY INCOMING INEQUALITY. ESPECIALLY FOR PEOPLE OF COLOR. URGE THE COMMITTEE TO ELIMINATE AS MANY OF THESE REGRESSIVE FEES AS POSSIBLE THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER DOCTOR. ARE YOU THE ONLY ELECTED PUBLIC DEFENDER IN THE STATE. ARE THEY'LL. WE NEED TO CHANGE THE LONG DELAY COUNTY. OKAY MR CISNEROS. GOOD MORNING. GOOD MORNING FOLKS OF JOSE CISNEROS SAN FRANCISCO TREASURE I'M HAPPY -- TO JOIN A PUBLIC DEFENDER JEFF ADACHI IN OUR COLLEAGUES FROM ALAMEDA COUNTY -- TO SPEAK TO YOU TODAY ALMOST TWO YEARS AGO -- MY OFFICE LAUNCH THE FINANCIAL JUSTICE PROJECT TO ASSESS AND REFORM FINES AND FEES AND TICKETS. THAT WERE HAVING A DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACT ON LOW PEOPLE OF COLOR. WE ARE THE FIRST IN THE NATION TO LAUNCH SUCH SUCH AN EFFORT WITHIN GOVERNMENT. AND AS TREASURER I CERTAINLY KNOW THE FINES AND FEES ARE A FUNDAMENTAL PART OF GOVERNMENT FINES. SERVICE CONSEQUENCES FOR BREAKING RULES AND FEES HELP GOVERNMENTS UNDER WRITE THEIR OWN COSTS. BUT FOR LOW INCOME PEOPLE AND PARTICULARLY FOR PEOPLE OF COLOR FINES AND FEES CAN BECOME PREDATORY. THEY CAN PUSH PEOPLE INTO A FINANCIAL HOLE THEY CANNOT CLIMB OUT OF WE DECIDED TO START THE FINANCIAL JUSTICE PROJECT WHEN WE HEARD THE SAN FRANCISCO'S WERE STRUGGLING TO PAY FINES AND FEES. MANY FINES AND FEES HAVE GROWN IN SIZE IN RECENT YEARS AND EXCEED PEOPLE'S ABILITY TO PAY THEM. WHEN PEOPLE CANNOT PAY THEM CONSEQUENCES CAN SAID IN WE HEARD FROM PEOPLE WHO HAD THEIR DRIVER'S LICENSE SUSPENDED BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T PAY TRAFFIC TICKETS? AND THEN BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T DRIVE THEY COULDN'T GET TO WORK AND THEY LOST THEIR JOBS WE HEARD ABOUT HOMELESS PEOPLE GIVEN TWO HUNDRED DOLLAR TICKETS WERE SLEEPING ON THE SIDEWALK. WHICH GREW TO FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS WHEN LEFT ON PAY. WE HEARD ABOUT SNOWBALLING -- WITH LATE FEES AND CREDIT SCORES GOING DOWN THESE CONSEQUENCES HAD DRAMATIC IMPACTS AND SOME LIVES WERE RUINED. WE KNOW THAT NOT THIS IS NOT JUST A SAN FRANCISCO PROBLEM. STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT NEARLY HALF OF AMERICANS CANNOT COME UP WITH FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS TO PAY FOR AN EMERGENCY EXPENSE. AS TREASURER I KNOW WE CAN BALANCE OUR BOOKS IN WAYS THAT ARE NOT ON THE BACKS OF THE POOR. AND THAT THESE REFORMS CAN WORK BETTER FOR GOVERNMENT. TO IN OUR FINANCIAL JUSTICE PROJECT WE HAD TWO MAIN GOALS FIRST WE LISTEN TO THE COMMUNITY MEMBERS TO IDENTIFY FINE AND FEE PAIN POINTS. THEN WE IDENTIFY DOABLE SOLUTIONS FOR GOVERNMENT AND THE COURTS. WE'VE ADVANCED ARRANGER REFORMS SOMETIMES WE BASE A FINER A FEE ON ABILITY TO PAY. RESEARCH SHOWS THAT WHEN YOU PROPORTION OF FINE ON SOMEONE'S INCOME THEY PAY MORE EASILY. REVENUE CAN ACTUALLY INCREASE IN THAT CIRCUMSTANCE. SOMETIMES WE OFFER A PATHWAY TO ACCOUNT OF REQUIRE MONEY AND SOMETIMES WE ELIMINATE FEES THAT DON'T MAKE SENSE. BOB AS WE ALL HEARD IN JUNE OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN SAN FRANCISCO BECAME THE FIRST COUNTY AND IN THE NATION TO ELIMINATE ALL ARE LOCALLY CONTROLLED ADMINISTRATIVE FEES THAT WE CHARGE TO PEOPLE EXITING JAIL AND CRIMINAL JUSTICE. SO AS YOU HEARD WE ELIMINATED FEES LIKE THE FIFTY DOLLAR -- MONTHLY PROBATION FEE AND THE THIRTY FIVE DOLLARS ANKLE MONITOR FEE -- WE WERE PROUD TO WORK WITH OUR PUBLIC FOUNDER -- JEFF ADACHI INTER DISTRICT ATTORNEY TO PETITION THE COURT AND AS I JUST MENTIONED WE WIPED OUT THIRTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS IN DEBT FROM THESE FEES. THAT WERE -- STILL ON THE RECORDS OF TWENTY ONE THOUSAND PEOPLE. WE KNEW THIS WAS THAT WE WERE NEVER GOING TO COLLECT IN FACT THE LARGEST FEE THAT WE WERE COLLECTING HAD A PAYMENT RATE OF LESS THAN 10%. ALL THE DETAILS OF WHAT WE COLLECTIVELY DID AS A COUNTY ARE INCLUDED IN THE REPORT -- WE DEVELOPED CALLED THE FINANCIAL JUSTICE PROJECT TITLE CRIMINAL JUSTICE ADMINISTRATIVE FEES. HIGH GAINS FOR PEOPLE LOW GAIN FOR GOVERNMENT AND YOU ALL HAVE A COPY OF IT. WE CREATED THE REPORT TO BE A RESOURCE FOR OTHERS ACROSS THE COUNTRY WHO WANTED TO TAKE SIMILAR ACTION WE'VE BEEN GETTING CALLS FROM COUNTIES. ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY -- WITH THE FINANCIAL JUSTICE PROJECT WE WORKED WITH OUR DEPARTMENTS TO RECOMMEND THE FEES AND FINES THAT CAN BE ALSO PLACED ON A SLIDING SCALE OF INCOME OR ABILITY TO PAY. OR ALLOW ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT LIKE COMMUNITY SERVICE. CRIMINAL JUSTICE ADMINISTRATIVE FEES AS I THINK YOU'VE HEARD ARE UNIQUELY DIFFERENT WE WORK DILIGENTLY FIND THE MOST REVENUE NEUTRAL ALTERNATIVES LIKE HAVING THESE. FEES ON A SLIDING INCOME SCALE OR ABILITY TO PAY THE MORE WE LOOKED AT ALTERNATIVES THE MORE WE CAME TO ONE CONCLUSION. THAT THESE FEES ARE HIGH PAYING FOR PEOPLE BUT LOW GAME FOR GOVERNMENT AND THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE FEES FOR CRIMINAL JUSTICE FEES ELIMINATION IS THE BEST SOLUTION. FOR THESE REASONS THE FEES ARE ALMOST ALWAYS ASSESSED ON VERY LOW INCOME PEOPLE WHO CAN NOT A PAID FOR THEM FOR THEM. AS YOU FOR THE VAST MAJORITY OF PEOPLE ARE UNEMPLOYED HAVE UNSTABLE HOUSING NO STEADY SOURCE OF INCOME. AND FIND WORK DIFFICULT OR NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO OBTAIN. AN EVALUATION OF THE PUBLIC DEFENDER'S CLEAN SLATE PROGRAM. FOUND THAT MORE THAN TWO THIRDS OF THE CLEAN SLATE CLIENTS ARE UNEMPLOYED AND THOSE WHO WERE EMPLOYED. HAD A MEDIAN INCOME OF TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS A YEAR. SO FEW PEOPLE CAN AFFORD TO PAY THEM THAT IT DOESN'T PENALIZE PENCIL OUT TO CONDUCT AN ABILITY TO PAY DETERMINATION. THE ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN OF HAVING STAFF CONDUCTED ABILITY TO PAY DETERMINATION ON DIDN'T JUSTIFY THE REVENUE OUR PROBATION CHIEF KAREN FLETCHER SAID SHE WANT HER SHE DIDN'T WANT. HER PROBATION OFFERS DID NOT WANT TO SERVICE COLLECTION OFFICERS THEY WEREN'T TRAINED TO BE THAT. THE COLLECTION RATES ON THESE FEES AVERAGE ABOUT 17% WHEN YOU'RE LOOK AT ALL OF THEM -- OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS. AS I SAID THE COLLECTION RATE FOR THE LARGEST FEE WAS LESS THAN 10%. AND FOR MORE THAN HALF THE FEES THE MONEY THE AMOUNT OF MONEY PROJECTED TO COME IN WITH SO MINIMAL THAT IT WASN'T EVEN ACCOUNTED FOR IN OUR BUDGET. COMPARE THIS TO OUR MUNICIPAL TRANSPORTATION AGENCY PARKING CITATION COLLECTION RATES WHICH ARE ABOVE 90%. OUR BUSINESS REGISTRATION LICENSE FEES WHICH ARE 95%. RESEARCH OF COLLECTION A SIMILAR SOME JUVENILE JUSTICE ADMINISTRATION FEES AND OTHER COUNTIES. SHOW THE COUNTIES OFTEN SPEND MORE TO COLLECT THESE FEES THAN THEY ACTUALLY BRING IN. LET'S NOT FORGET THE FEES WE ELIMINATED ARE ADMINISTRATIVE FEES. THEIR GOALS ARE SIMPLY TO RECOUP COST THEY'RE NOT MEANT TO BE AN ADDITIONAL LAYER OF PUNISHMENT. THIRDLY THESE FEES ARE ALSO DIFFERENT IN THAT RESEARCH SHOWS THAT THEY CAN ACTUALLY CONTRIBUTE TO RECIDIVISM AND CREATE BARRIERS TO ENTRY. BECAUSE THESE FEES CAN BE COLLECTED THROUGH WAGE GARNISHMENT AND BANK ACCOUNT LEVIES THEY CAN DRIVE PEOPLE TOWARD UNDERGROUND ECONOMIES. AND CHARGING PEOPLE WITH SUCH LARGE BILLS CAN DRIVE PEOPLE TO FIND SOLUTIONS TO COME UP WITH LARGE AMOUNTS OF CASH. RESEARCH CONDUCTED BY THE WHITE HOUSE COUNCIL OF ECONOMIC ADVISERS. THE BRENNAN CENTER FOR JUSTICE AND OTHERS SHOWS THAT THESE FEES CAN CREATE BARRIERS TO ENTRY. AND ALL OF OUR SAN FRANCISCO CRIMINAL JUST JUST. LEADERS ALL SUPPORTED THESE REFORMS BECAUSE THEY KNOW THAT THESE REFORMS SUPPORT PEOPLE'S REENTRY. THAT'S GOING TO KEEP US SAFER AS A CITY AND ALSO CAN BE MORE EFFECTIVE IN THE LONG TERM. AND FINALLY OUR MAYORS BUDGET OFFICE ESTIMATE IT THE BENEFITS OF ELIMINATING THESE FEES FAR OUTWEIGHS THE COSTS. WE ESTIMATED THAT ELIMINATION OF THESE CRIMINAL JUSTICE ADMINISTRATION FEES COSTS ARE COUNTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR AND FOR GONE REVENUE. WE KNOW THAT'S REAL COST BUT ELIMINATING THESE FEES AND OUTSTANDING DEBT LIFTED THIRTY TIMES THAT THIRTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS IN DEBT. OFF OF TWENTY ONE THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS THAT'S AN INVESTMENT WITH A GREAT RETURN FOR OUR CITY. WHENEVER I THINK ABOUT OUR WORK REFORMING CRIMINAL JUSTICE HE'S I THINK ABOUT MERRY VANDERGRIFT. AFTER MERRY'S TIME IN JAIL SHE GOT CLEAN FROM HER OBJECTION. SHE FOUND A NEW JOB A REUNITED WITH THEIR DAUGHTER. EVERYTHING WAS GOING WELL. AND THEN WE HAD -- IT WITH A BILL FOR EIGHTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS TO PAY UP FRONT FOR THREE YEARS OF PROBATION FEES. THIS CERTAINLY DIDN'T HELP MERRY'S REENTRY INTO THE COMMUNITY AND GET HER BACK ON HER FEET IN FACT JUST THE OPPOSITE. AND THESE FEES DIDN'T WORK FOR GOVERNMENT EITHER BECAUSE AS I MENTIONED WE DON'T EVER RECOUP THE COST WE SPEND COLLECT THESE FEES. WE NEED TO FIND MORE JUST AND SUSTAINABLE SOURCES OF REVENUE TO PAY FOR OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. AND I'M PROUD OF THE WORK WE'RE STARTING TO DO IN CALIFORNIA AT THIS LOCAL AND HOPEFULLY AT THE STATE LEVEL. GOVERNMENT WILL -- SHOULD BE AN EQUALIZER OF OPPORTUNITY AND NOT A DRIVER OF INEQUALITY THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CISNEROS SO I ASSUME YOU'RE AN ELECTED TREASURE I AM YES ONE OF THE FEW. OR THE ONLY NO ACTUALLY ABOUT HALF OF THE TREASURES OKAY. I CAN SEE THE DIFFERENCE. ARE. ANY OTHER QUICK QUESTIONS BEFORE WE GO TO THE NEXT PANEL I WOULD. AS MUCH AS YOU LOVE TO SEE ELECTED TREASURES. LANDERS I REALLY THINK THIS MORE REFLECTS. THE ATTITUDES IN THE COUNTY THAN IT DOES WHETHER THEY'RE ELECTED OR NOT GIVEN THAT WE HAVE. TO ELECTED OFFICIALS WHO ARE ARE SAYING THE SAME THING SO I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD HAVE MORE ELECTED OFFICIALS JUST SAY. GOOD YOU ALL MENTION OBVIOUSLY THAT THE COST OF COLLECTING YOU KNOW. ISN'T YELLING THE RETURN CAN YOU QUANTIFY THE RESOURCES SPENT ON TRYING TO COLLECT. SINCE THAT CAME UP. FROM A FEW OF YOU COUNTY YOU IT'S DONE THROUGH OUR CENTRAL COLLECTIONS AND THEY ESTIMATED IT WAS ABOUT THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR FOR THE ONE POINT FOUR FIVE NAY AND WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO COLLECT. INSTEAD OF JUST WHO UNDERSTANDING IS THAT WAS BASICALLY A WASH BECAUSE THE AMOUNT OF COSTS THAT YOU'RE PUTTING INTO COLLECTIONS AND EVERYTHING ELSE PRETTY MUCH WIPED OUT. AND THAT WAS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY THE PROBATION DEPARTMENT EVEN THERE THERE THERE WERE GETTING I THINK TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS IN REVENUE EACH YEAR. VOTED TO ELIMINATE. RIGHT. I MEAN YOU KNOW IT IT DID RECALL REQUIRE BACK FILLING YOU KNOW SOME COST BUT IT WASN'T IN NEARLY IS IT AS MUCH AS YOU MIGHT THINK. OKAY. ONE MORE QUESTION. THANK YOU I TREASURE CISNEROS YOU MENTIONED SOME OF THE DOWNSTREAM COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS RIGHT AND I'VE SEEN CLIENTS FOR WHOM THIS IS THE CASE THEY LOSE THEIR LEG DRIVER'S LICENSE THEY LOSE THEIR JOB. THEY BECOMING ELIGIBLE FOR HOUSING BECAUSE OF THESE WARRANTS ARE OUT FOR THEM -- AND SO I WISH AND THE RECIDIVISM WHICH OBVIOUSLY COST AS MANY AS WELL AND IS A SAFETY ISSUE. I WISH WE COULD QUALIFY THAT IT'S RIGHT THOSE DOWNSTREAM COSTS THAT ARE DEFINITELY COSTING SAN FRANCISCO MONEY WHEN YOU SEE A RISE IN HOMELESSNESS BECAUSE OF THIS AND THE LIKE. ANY SENSE OF WHAT THE COST IS OF THAT. WE'RE STILL LOOKING AT THAT -- WOULD BE HAPPY TO GET BUT YOU KNOW. THE EVIDENCE IS IS VERY OBVIOUS AND WE JUST DIGGING TO FIND SOME MORE THE DETAILS TO SUPPORT THE ACTUAL NUMBERS. THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU. I WANT TO THAT. AT THE NEXT BATTLE -- CONSIDERATIONS OF REFORMING THE STRUCTURE OF FINES AND FEES US DEFINITELY COMPOST. THINK IS BOY. AB A BRANDING GRAIN. MERRY BORE. AND SHELLEY KARAN. HOPEFULLY I CAME CLOSE TO SOME OF THESE NAMES. YOU GOT MY NAME RIGHT RIGHT. GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN JONES SAWYER AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS STEPHANIE COMBOS BOY A AND I AM A SUPERVISING ATTORNEY AND THE POLICY ADVOCACY CLINIC AT UC BERKELEY SCHOOL OF LAW. IT'S AN HONOR TO BE TESTIFYING BEFORE YOU TODAY CONSIDERING THE SIGNIFICANT ROLE THAT THIS COMMITTEE HAS PLAYED IN ADVANCING CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND THE COUNTRY. SINCE TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN OUR CLINIC HAS BEEN RESEARCHING THE ARRAY OF COSTS IMPOSE ON PEOPLE IN OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM. WE WORK CLOSELY WITH SENATOR MITCHELL ON SB ONE NINETY EIGHT WHICH REPEALED COUNTY AUTHORITY TO CHARGE NEW JUVENILE FEES TO FAMILIES OF YOUNG PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA STARTNG JANUARY ONE OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND WE PUBLISHED A RESEARCH REPORT ON THE ISSUE WHICH FOUND THAT FEE PRACTICES ACROSS THE STATE WERE. HARMFUL UNLAWFUL AND COSTLY AND REALLY UNDERMINE THE REHABILITATIVE PURPOSE OF THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM. IN FACT WE WERE ABLE TO FIND A SINGLE COUNTY IN WHICH PRACTICES WERE BOTH LAWFUL AND REVENUE GENERATING WHICH IS WHY SEVERAL COUNTIES ACTED AHEAD OF SB ONE NINETY TO AND THE ASSESSMENT AND COLLECTION OF THESE HARMFUL AND REGRESSIVE FEES. ANY YEAR INTO IMPLEMENTATION OF SB ONE THAT ALL FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES HAVE STOPPED CHARGING JUVENILE FEES WITHOUT REPORTING ANY NEGATIVE IMPACTS TO PUBLIC SAFETY. OR PROVISION OF SERVICES TO YOUNG PEOPLE. AND ALTHOUGH NOT REQUIRED BY SB ONE NINETY THIRTY SIX COUNTIES HAVE VOLUNTARILY DECIDED TO STOP COLLECTING ON OLD JUVENILE FEET AT RELIEVING FAMILIES ACROSS THE STATE OF OVER TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS. DISAPPOINTINGLY THOUGH THERE ARE STILL TWENTY TWO COUNTIES THAT ARE ACTIVELY COLLECTING ON JUVENILE FEE ACCOUNTS. 82% OF WHICH IS HELD IN THREE COUNTIES RIVERSIDE ORANGE AND SAN DIEGO. GIVEN WHAT WE'VE LEARNED IN THE JUVENILE SPACE WERE NOW SUPPORTING RESEARCH EFFORTS ON THE ASSESSMENT AND COLLECTION IN A CRIMINAL OR ADULT JUSTICE SYSTEM. AND WHILE WE'RE STILL CONTINUING TO GATHER DATA AND SPEAK TO STAKEHOLDERS WE'VE ALREADY OBSERVE SIMILAR FINDINGS TO THOSE IN THE JUVENILE SPACE. THESE FEES ARE HIGH HARM TO INDIVIDUALS AND COSTLY TO BOTH LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND COMMUNITIES. AT EVERY POINT IN THE CRIMINAL LEGAL PROCESS CALIFORNIA STATE LAW AUTHORIZES COUNTIES TO CHARGE FEES. FROM BOOKING ARRESTS TO REPRESENTATION BY FREE PUBLIC DEFENDER AND PROBATION SUPERVISION. AN INDIVIDUAL CAN FACE A HOST OF FEES INCLUDING FOR THE COLLECTION OF THOSE FEES. COUNTIES ULTIMATELY DECIDE WHICH ADMINISTRATIVE FEES TO CHARGE SO PRACTICES VARY WIDELY ACROSS THE STATE. FOR EXAMPLE IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY AND IT'S ALL ON PROBATION FOR FIVE YEARS CAN BE CHARGED ALMOST TWELVE THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR PROBATION SUPERVISION. AND INVESTIGATION REPORT BUT JUST MY IMPERIAL THEY WOULD ONLY BE CHARGE SEVENTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS. TO PROTECT INDIVIDUALS AGAINST EXCESSIVE FEES STATE LAW ALLOWS FOR BUT DOES NOT ALWAYS MANDATE. A COUNTIES TO CONSIDER AN INDIVIDUAL'S INCOME BEFORE CHARGING FEES BUT YET IN MANY INSTANCES AND AS WE'VE HEARD. MOST COUNTIES ARE NOT CONDUCTING MEANINGFUL ABILITY TO PAY DETERMINATIONS AND IN SOME CASES NOT DOING ANY DETERMINATIONS AT ALL. AND SO PEOPLE ARE BEING FACED WITH BILLS THAT THEY SIMPLY CANNOT AFFORD TO PAY AND WILL NEVER PAY. AND ONCE IMPOSE FEES AREN'T JUST BILLS THEY CAN BECOME CIVIL JUDGMENTS SUBJECTING PEOPLE TO TAX INTERCEPTS AND WAGE GARNISHMENT. AND THESE FEES DISPROPORTIONATELY HARMED LOW INCOME PEOPLE AND PEOPLE OF COLOR. DUE TO OVER POLICING AND TARGET POLICING COMMUNITIES OF COLOR BLACK AND BROWN PEOPLE ARE PUNISHED MORE FREQUENTLY AND HARSHLY AT A VARIETY OF DISCRETION POINTS WHICH ONLY LEADS TO HIGHER FEE BURDENS. STUDIES HAVE FOUND THAT CRIMINAL JUSTICE THAT CORRELATES WITH A GREATER LIKELIHOOD OF RACES RECIDIVISM EVEN ONE CONTROLLING FOR CASE DEMOGRAPHICS AND CHARACTERISTICS DOES NOT ONLY HARMS PUBLIC SAFETY. BUT THESE NEGATIVE OUTCOMES ONLY MAKE REENTRY FOR PEOPLE THAT MUCH HARDER. AND AS WE'VE HEARD THESE FEES ARE REALLY JUST INTENDED TO HELP LOCAL JURISDICTIONS RECOUP COSTS AND IT COUNTIES OFTEN RECOVER ONLY A SMALL PROPORTION OF WHAT THEY A SASS. FOR EXAMPLE AS WE HEARD IN SAN FRANCISCO COUNTY LESS THAN 10% OF SOME ADMINISTRATIVE FEES WERE ACTUALLY COLLECTED. AND SUCH LOW RETURN RATES ARE NOT THE RESULT OF LACKS COLLECTION EFFORTS BECAUSE BUT BECAUSE MOST SYSTEM INVOLVED PEOPLE ARE LOW INCOME AND CANNOT AFFORD TO PAY THESE FEES. FOR EXAMPLE IN HUMBOLDT COUNTY 84% OF PEOPLE ON PROBATION HAD A MONTHLY INCOME OF LESS THAN ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS. FURTHER COUNTY SPEND SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TRYING TO ASSESS AND COLLECT FEES FOR EXAMPLE HERE IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY IN FISCAL YEAR. TWENTY SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN THEY REPORTED SPENDING OVER FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS COLLECTING ONLY TO FEES THE SUPERVISION AND DRUG TESTING FEES. BUT THESE THESE AREN'T JUST COSTLY TO COUNTIES FEES CROWD OUT SPENDING ON POSITIVE SOCIAL GOODS SUCH AS HEALTHCARE AND EDUCATION WHICH ONLY IMPOSES HARM OVER TIME. PROLONGS OR EXACERBATE POVERTY AND GENERATES COSTA FAMILIES COMMUNITIES AND SOCIETY. IN THE ONLY STUDY OF ITS KIND AT TWENTY SIX ANALYSIS FOUND THAT ELIMINATING JUVENILE FEES AND ONE COUNTY IN CALIFORNIA. RESULT IN A NET FINANCIAL BENEFIT TO SOCIETY A FIVE POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. MOMENTUM IS BUILDING FOR FINES AND FEES ARE FORM ESPECIALLY IN CALIFORNIA AS WE COME OFF THE HEELS OF SB ONE NINETY WHICH MADE CALIFORNIA THE FIRST STATE IN THE COUNTRY TO ELIMINATE FEES IN THE JUVENILE SYSTEM. AND WHILE MORE MORE COUNTIES ARE DECIDING TO TAKE UP THIS ISSUE THERE ARE SEVERAL WAYS IN WHICH THE LEGISLATURE CAN HELP PLAY A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN ENDING THE HARM CAUSED BY THESE FEES. FIRST THE LEGISLATURE CAN STOP THE CONTINUING HARM CAUSED TO FAMILIES LIVING IN COUNTIES THAT ARE STILL COLLECTING ON OLD JUVENILE FEET AT LEGISLATION THAT WOULD REQUIRE COUNTIES TO AND COLLECTION AND DISCHARGE OLDER. OLD JUVENILE FEES WAS ORIGINALLY A PART OF SB ONE NINETY AND WOULD PROVIDE RELIEF TO FAMILIES LIVING THE TWENTY TWO COUNTIES THAT ARE STILL ACTIVELY PURSUING JUVENILE FEE ACCOUNTS. SECOND THE LEGISLATURE CAN LIMIT THE ROLE THAT THE STATE PLAYS PARTICULARLY THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD IN THE ONGOING COLLECTION OF PREVIOUSLY SS JUVENILE FEES. BY ENDING LOCAL AUTHORITY TO CHARGE NEW JUVENILE FEES WITH THE SIGNING OF SB ONE NINETY CALIFORNIA MADE CLEAR THAT THESE FEES ARE HARMFUL AN AGGRESSIVE. AND YET STATE RESOURCES ARE STILL BEING PUT TOWARDS COLLECTION OF THESE FEES IN THOSE TWENTY TWO COUNTIES. THIRD OF THE LEGISLATURE CAN ELIMINATE COUNTY AUTHORITY TO CHARGE FEES TO ADULTS IN THE JUSTICE SYSTEM JUST LIKE IT DID WITH JUVENILE FEES AN SP. ONE NINETY ENDING THE ASSESSMENT OF THESE HE'S WILL ADVANCE PUBLIC SAFETY OR MITIGATING THE NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES THAT SUCH COST CURRENTLY IMPOSE ON INDIVIDUALS AND COMMUNITIES. FINALLY THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD ACKNOWLEDGE THE FULL RANGE OF COSTS THAT MAKE REENTRY FOR FORMER SYSTEM INVOLVED INDIVIDUAL INDIVIDUALS NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE. WE'VE SEEN THE RELIEF THAT YOUNG PEOPLE AND THEIR FAMILIES HAVE HAD UNDER SB. ONE NINETY BUT QUITE OFTEN FOR YOUNG PEOPLE IN THE JUVENILE SYSTEM. THERE ARE OTHER THINGS THAT THEY'RE STILL FACING FINES AND RESTITUTION SO FEES ARE REALLY ONLY ONE PIECE OF THE PUZZLE. CALIFORNIA HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE THE LEAD IN THIS COUNTRY ON FINES AND FEES. THE AMERICAN BAR ASSOCIATION THE NATIONAL COUNCIL OF STATE LEGISLATURES THE NATIONAL COUNCIL OF JUVENILE AND FAMILY COURT JUDGES AND THE US CIVIL RIGHTS COMMISSION HAVE ALL WAITED IN. AND THEY ALL AGREED THAT WE MUST ELIMINATE AND REDUCED FINES AND FEES. WE CANNOT CONTINUE TO LIVE UNDER THE ILLUSION THAT MAKING FEES AND FINES PROPORTIONATE TO THE ALLEGED CRIME OR RIGHT SIZING PAYMENT IS ANYTHING BUT EXACERBATING PERPETUATE EXISTING RACIAL INEQUITIES. BY INTRODUCING MONEY INTO THE JUSTICE SYSTEM WE'VE PERVERTED OUR CONCEPTION OF WHAT IT MEANS TO HELP BE HELD RESPONSIBLE. AND AS A RESULT WE ONLY WHITE IN THE REGION IMPACT OF OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM TO INCLUDE MORE PEOPLE AND MORE LONG LASTING COLLATERAL CONSEQUENCES AND CONSEQUENCES WHICH IS ONLY FURTHER THE JUSTICE SYSTEMS RELEGATION OF BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITIES TO A SECOND CLASS STATUS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND I'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS OR MEET WITH ANY OF THE MEMBERS AND THEIR STAFF. THANK YOU MIX [inaudible] THE MORNING. MY NAME'S BRANDING GREEN I'M A CLINICAL SUPERVISOR THESE BAKING LAWCENTER WHERE I LEAD A PRACTICE AROUND DECRIMINALIZATION OF POVERTY. THESE MAKE ME LAWCENTER WAS A FOUNDING MEMBER OF THE BACK ON THE ROAD COALITION THAT HAS DONE A LOT OF THE WORK AROUND TRAFFIC WHICH I THINK IS INSTRUCTIVE -- OFTENTIMES THESE ISSUES OR SPOKEN ABOUT AS FINANCIAL JUSTICE ISSUES I'M GLAD FOR THE INVITATION TO SPEAK ABOUT THESE IS RACIAL JUSTICE ISSUE. THE BACK IN A ROW COALITION PUBLISHED TWO REPORTS NOT FIND ARRESTED AND NOT TO FORGET SOME PROBLEM WHICH WERE THE HIGHLIGHTED HOW DRIVERS AYE SUSPENSIONS FOR INSTANCE ARE ACTUALLY ON THE MANIFESTATION OF RACIALIZED POLICING SO YOU EIGHT WE ARE ABLE TO MATCH SQUARELY. RACE ETHNICITY AND POVERTY IN SHOW WHERE THE HIGHEST INCIDENCE DRIVERS I SUSPENSIONS -- OCCURRED -- BOTH IN CALIFORNIA AND IN OTHER PARTS OF FOR INSTANCE BLACK FOLKS DON'T DRIVE WORSE THAN WHITE FOLKS AND ALMOST EVERYWHERE IN THE COUNTRY BY FOLKS SUFFER FROM DR AYE SUSPENSION THE DISPROPORTIONATE RIGHT. LOSS AND I WAS A PUBLIC DEFENDER CONTRA COSTA COUNTY AND WHEN I LEFT THERE TO START THIS PEOPLE ASK WHY DID IT. BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T REALLY SEE A DRIVER'S LICENSE BUSINESS TRAFFIC ISSUES CRIMINAL JUSTICE ISSUES BUT WE KNOW THE TRAFFIC -- ISSUES ARE ACTUALLY ON RAMPS TO CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM SO A DRIVER'S LICENSE PENSION IS THE MANIFESTATION OF A POLICE DOT WHICH USUALLY RESULT IN OTHER FORMS OF CRIMINALIZATION SO DRIVERS AYE SUSPENSIONS FOR INSTANCE CAN EITHER BE -- CHARGE IS A MISDEMEANOR CHARGE IN A FRACTION RIGHT. ON WE BOTH LET THAT WORK -- AIN'T RECENTLY OR LAST YEAR -- WHEN THE LEDGE WEIGHT WHEN THE GOVERNOR -- PUSHED IN DRIVES AYE SUSPENSION FOR FAILURE TO PAY FOR INSTANCE -- WE ARE ABLE TO PUSH ALAMEDA COUNTY COURT TO PER CALL OVER AND EIGHTY THREE THOUSAND DRIVERS AYE SUSPENSIONS MAKING ALAMEDA COUNTY THE FIRST COUNTY TO DO SO -- ALSO IN NETWORK -- WE WERE ABLE -- TO ADVOCATE IN HAVE ABILITY TO PAY BE SOMETHING EXISTS IN EVERY SUPERIOR COURT IN CALIFORNIA -- AND AS A RESULT OF THAT WORK WHY ABILITY PAY -- IS NOT AN EFFECTIVE OR EFFICIENT SOLUTION SO CURRENTLY YOU GET A TRAFFIC TICKET IN THEORY EVERY COUNTY COURT IN CALIFORNIA SO SEVEN ABILITY PAY PROCESS LOOKS EXTREMELY DIFFERENT FROM COUNTY TO COUNTY. SO ALAMEDA COUNTY -- BECAUSE WE'RE ABLE TO ADVOCATE ON THE GROUND WE OWE TO PUSH ALAMEDA COUNTY -- TO HAVE A OF PAY ME PROCESS WHERE IF YOU QUALIFIED YOU GOT A A 50% REDUCTION STILL NOT ENOUGH FOR THEM TO ACTUALLY THE TO BE TO MAKE PAYMENTS. ON THAT ABILITY PAY PROCESS WAS ACTUALLY BASED ON A 125% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LINE WHICH IS ROUGHLY TWELVE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS PER YEAR -- FOR REFERENCE THE AVERAGE MEDIAN INCOME ALAMEDA COUNTY IS ABOUT A HUNDRED TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS AND FOR BLACK FOLKS IN PARTICULAR IT'S UNDER THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. SO LAST YEAR WE WERE ABLE TO PUSH THE COURT TO ADOPT THE HOOD STANDARD WHICH IS THE CLOSEST THING -- TO AREA MEDIAN INCOME AND COST -- UNFORTUNATELY THE COURT ON THE ADOPTED THE EXTREMELY LOW INCOME STANDARD BUT THAT WAS APPROXIMATELY TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS MORE THAN THE FEDERAL POVERTY LINE SO THAT WOULD BRING MORE PEOPLE. INTO THIS ABILITY PAY PROCESS WILL STILL IS AN INDICATION OF JUST HOW BROKE IN IT IS -- IN OUR NEIGHBORING COUNTY CONTRA COSTA COUNTY WE HAD CLIENTS WHO CAME TO OUR CLINIC WHO WERE APPROVED FOR THE ABILITY TO PAY PROCESS AND FOR INSTANCE WERE GIVING COMMUNITY SERVICE -- IN OUR OPINION COMMUNITY SERVICES ACTUALLY INDENTURED SERVITUDE BECAUSE WHILE THE ASKING -- POOR FOLKS TO PERFORM COMMUNITY SERVICE OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO CANNOT PAY BECAUSE THIS IS A MANIFESTATION OF RACIALIZED POLICING -- WE'RE MOSTLY TALKING ABOUT LOW INCOME COMMUNITIS OF COLOR WHO ARE BEING ASKED TO USE THEIR LABOR TO PAY FOR THINGS -- THIS ONE PARTICULAR CLIENT WAS GIVING EIGHTY HOURS OF COMMUNITY SERVICE. SO IF YOU THINK ABOUT THAT THAT. WEEKS OF COMMUNITY SERVICE BECAUSE HE CANNOT AFFORD TO PAY A TRAFFIC TICKET -- FOR ME THAT IS -- STRIKING PROOF THEY BOTH ABILITY TO PAY BECAUSE IT LOOKS DIFFERENT FROM COUNTY TO COUNTY AND COMMUNITY SERVICE ARE NOT ADEQUATE SOLUTIONS. NUMBER IS MAKE ME LAWCENTER IS PART OF THE BACK OF THE WORLD COALITION WAS ALSO ON THE THE LEADERS IN THE WORK AROUND PARKING TICKET OR FORM -- PRIOR TO THE BILL TWO YEARS PRIOR TO THAT WE ISSUE PUBLIC RECORDS ACT REQUEST -- FOR THE EIGHT LARGEST CITIES IN ALAMEDA COUNTY AND WE COULD SHOW THAT FOR INSTANCE IN OAKLAND THE PHASE OF TICKETS MATT SQUARE THE OVER THE OUTSTANDING DEBT -- WE HAD CLIENTS WHO CAME MAIN WHO COULD NOT PAY THEIR PARKING TICKETS AND THEREFORE THEIR DMV REGISTRATION WAS WITH HAIL WHICH AGAIN BECAUSE THE WAY THAT -- POLICING HAPPENS MEANT THAT THOSE FOLKS WERE ALSO -- AT RISK FOR GOING TO AN ON RAMP TO THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM IF YOU DON'T HAVE REGISTRATION YOUR VEHICLE BE PULLED OVER YOU COULD END UP IN CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM OR HAVE YOUR VEHICLE TOLD. MOST RECENTLY -- OR RATHER THE THE SUCCESS -- MOST RECENTLY WAS IN ALAMEDA COUNTY BEFORE BUT THAT WORK WAS ACTUALLY THREE YEARS IN THE MAKING SO WHEN I FIRST STARTED IT. THESE BACON LAWCENTER I WAS HANDED A BUNCH A CASE FILES FOR WE'RE NO LONGER ON PROBATION BUT STILL OLD OUTSTANDING DEBT AND WERE EITHER CURRENTLY OR THREAT OF BEING -- HAVING THEIR WAGES GARNISHED BY THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD HAVING THEIR TAXES INTERCEPTED ACCEPT OR I'M TO ARRANGE A PUBLIC RECORDS ACT REQUEST WILL WE GET A LOT OF DATA FROM ALAMEDA COUNTY AND WERE ABLE TO SHOW JUST HOW ABILITY PAY -- WAS BROKEN SO LUCKILY FOR CLIENTS IN ALAMEDA COUNTY AND THEY WERE ABLE TO EXIT PROBATION -- WHILE STILL ALLOWING THE SEAS BUT THEY WEREN'T ABLE TO PAY THESE FEES SO THEIR LIVES WERE NOT ABLE TO CHANGE. MOST RECENTLY -- THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS -- APPROVED ADD TO THE THE ELIMINATION THESE FEES WILL ELIMINATE A HUNDRED SEVENTY EIGHT THOUSAND ACCOUNTS AND FORTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS IN DEBT. THAT WAS AMAZING MAKING ALAMEDA COUNTY THE SECOND COUNTY IN THE COUNTRY TO DO THAT -- BUT JUST TO SHOW HOW THAT WAS -- NOT ENOUGH -- MOST RECENTLY WE HAD CLIENTS COME IN WHO HAD THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS REMOVED BECAUSE OF THE PUBLIC DEFENDER REPRESENTATION FEE PROBATION FEE XTERRA BUT STILL OLD THESE FEES FROM -- THAT CRIMINAL. FINES FEES ONE PARTICULAR CLIENT -- OLD APPROXIMATELY FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS HE WAS ABOUT TO BE GARNISHED FOR THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD -- HE MAY TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR HIS RENT WAS ALSO TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS PER MONTH -- WHICH MEANT THAT HE HAD NO MONEY LEFT TO BE TO PAY FOR THESE FUNDS IF FEES AND HE WAS HAVING APPROXIMATELY 15% OF HIS CHECK GARNISH EACH MUCH BUT ACTUALLY WE MADE HIM. LATE -- ON HIS RIGHT BECAUSE YOU CAN PAY THE TOTAL AMOUNT. WE ARE NOW -- FOUNDING MEMBERS OF THE DEBT FREE JUSTICE CALIFORNIA -- COALITION WHICH IS A COALITION WHICH IS COMPRISED OF LAWYERS -- BASE BUILDING A MOVEMENT -- ORGANIZATIONS POLICY FOLKS X. CENTER -- IN ALAMEDA COUNTY WORK YOU ALL SHOULD HAVE A COPY OF OUR REPORT -- RIGHT WHICH REALLY GOES INTO DETAIL ABOUT -- HAVE ALAMEDA COUNTY NGUYEN CAME TO BE -- HOW THERE WAS ONLY APPROXIMATELY 4% OF -- FEES BEING COLLECTED HOW FOR INSTANCE -- FOLKS WERE NOT GETTING AN ABILITY TO PAY PROCESS EITHER AT THE BEGINNING OR AT IN PRIOR TO EXITING -- PROBATION -- AND AS I SAID EVEN THOUGH FORTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS HAS BEEN FOR GIVING NOW -- THAT IS STILL NOT ENOUGH FOR FOLKS ACTS OUT ALSO NOTED FOR INSTANCE TO SHARES WORK ALTERNATIVE PROGRAM IS A PROGRAM THAT WE DON'T KNOW -- HOW MANY PEOPLE WERE UNABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN BECAUSE IT WAS ONE THAT YOU HAVE TO PAY UP FRONT? SO IF YOU COULD PAID UP FRONT SINCE THE ALTERNATE INCARCERATION YOU JUST WENT TO JAIL -- SO NOW WILL HAVE MORE NUMBERS HOPEFULLY ON HOW MANY PEOPLE ACTUALLY BEEN A BEING ABLE TO BENEFIT FROM THAT -- SO I WON'T BE LABOR -- WITH OUR OTHER COLLEAGUES BRING IT WAS ACCEPT RESPECTABLE OUT BUT I THINK AGAIN THE TRAFFIC SPACE THE PARKING SPACE -- ARE INSTRUCTIVE IN TERMS OF WHY ABILITY PAY WILL NOT WORK -- IT'S BROKEN INEFFICIENT AND IT ACTUALLY ENDS UP SERVING TO HARM PEOPLE SO THE LAST THING I WOULD SAY IS THAT IN ALAMEDA COUNTY WE GET REPORTS FROM THE COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT. IN EVERY MONTH APPROXIMATELY 50% OF PEOPLE OR MORE WHO WE PRESUME WOULD ORDINARILY OR ARE AUTOMATICALLY QUALIFY FOR BILLY TO PAY ARE BEING DENIED -- ALAMEDA COUNTY. THANK YOU THANK YOU. NEXT. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS SHELLY CURRENT I'M THE DIRECTOR OF THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SERVICES OFFICE FOR THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL OF CALIFORNIA -- I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE WITH YOU THIS MORNING -- TO SHARE SOME PERSPECTIVES FROM THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL ABOUT THE SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE IN CALIFORNIA RICK RICK -- RIGHT NOW RELATED TO CRIMINAL FINES AND AS HAS BEEN NOTED BY PREVIOUS SPEAKERS ESPECIALLY THE LA ALL THE SYSTEM HAS EVOLVED SIGNIFICANTLY OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST TWENTY YEARS. AND THE RESULT IS -- FINES AND FEES THE AMOUNT THAT INDIVIDUALS AND UP PAYING -- IS MORE THAN IT WAS TWENTY YEARS AGO AND THE REASON THAT THAT HAS HAPPENED IS BECAUSE IT DECISIONS HAVE BEEN MADE BY PRIOR LEGISLATORS. TO FORM -- INPUT TO TO FUND IMPORTANT -- GOVERNMENT SERVICES THROUGH THE IMPOSITION OF FINES AND FEES. WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THE PURPOSES OF PUNISHER OF OF SENTENCING ON MAY THINK ABOUT PUNISHMENT OR DETERRENCE REHABILITATION REPARATIONS? AND SOME OF THE FINES AND FEES ARE INCLUDED RIGHT NOW -- IN IN THE SYSTEM GO TO THAT TO THE BASE FIND SOMETHING THEY BECAUSE COULD BE CONSIDERED PUNISHMENT OR RESTITUTION COULD BE. REPARATIONS BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT AT THE IMPORTANT SERVICES LIKE VICTIMS WITH TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY. OR EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES CONSTRUCTION OF COURT HOUSES -- OFFSETTING OTHER FINES AND FEES THOSE AREN'T DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE THE BOMB PURPOSES OF PUNISHMENT THAT ONE THINKS OF INITIALLY WHEN THERE'S OR SENTENCING WHEN THEY'RE THINKING ABOUT -- PUNISHMENT AND SO THAT'S JUST AS YOU ALL GOING TO THESE CONVERSATIONS AND DELIBERATIONS ABOUT THE BEST WAY OF APPROACHING SOME OF THESE IMPORTANT PUBLIC POLICY DECISIONS. I THINK IS MISS LEE POINTED OUT -- COURT FILINGS HAVE GONE DOWN SIGNIFICANTLY OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS -- THERE BEEN DIFFERENT POLICY REASONS FOR THAT HAVING HAPPENED AND I'LL I'LL TALK ABOUT THOSE IN A MINUTE -- BUT I THINK IT'S IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT -- BECAUSE OF THAT THE COLLECTION OF FINES AND FEES HAS HAS ALSO BEEN IMPACTED BY -- BY THE REDUCTION IN THESE COURT FILINGS -- AND SO AS A RESULT FUNDING FOR SOME OF THESE IMPORTANT GOVERNMENT SERVICES THAT THAT WE ALL RELY UPON -- HAVE ALSO GONE DOWN AND AND THAT'S ANOTHER THING THAT THAT WE ENCOURAGE YOU ALL TO CONSIDER AS YOU'RE TACKLING THIS IMPORTANT ISSUES. SO SOME OF THE POLICY CHANGES THAT I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT OR THINGS LIKE PROPOSITION FORTY SEVEN THAT WENT INTO EFFECT SEVERAL YEARS AGO AND THAT CHANGED A LOT OF FELONIES TO MISDEMEANORS. THAT HAD IMPLICATIONS ON ON FELONY FILINGS AND AND EVEN MOST RECENTLY MISDEMEANOR FILINGS AND AGAIN THE IMPACT OF THAT ON FINES AND FEES. THE TRAFFIC MNESTY PROGRAM WHICH WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS ENACTED THE COUPLE OF YEARS AGO BY THE LEGISLATURE ALSO REDUCE THE SOME OF THE BRANDS -- ON LOW INCOME DEFENDANTS AND OTHERS -- RELATED TO FINES AND FEES AND THEN ALSO RE THAT ADDRESS PENSION OF DRIVERS -- FORCE ALL OR TRAFFIC IN FRONT ALSO IT'S FINES AND FEES -- WE DON'T KNOW THE EXACT ESTIMATES ON HOW MUCH THIS IS GOING TO HAPPEN ALL OF THOSE HAVE BEEN RELATIVELY RECENT AND SO WE'LL GET WILL PAY ATTENTION OVER THE COURSE OF THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS. TO SEE WHAT IMPACT THOSE THOSE CHANGES IN LAWS THAT MIGHT HAPPEN. HOUSE ONE HIGHLIGHT A COUPLE OF THINGS THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL HAS DONE OF LATE TO ADDRESS SOME OF THESE SOME OF THESE ISSUES. ONE IS IN OCTOBER -- TWENTY SIXTEEN WE APPLIED FOR A UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE GRANT TO CONDUCT ABILITY TO PAY DETERMINATIONS FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE RECEIVED -- TO TRAFFIC INFRACTIONS AND OTHER LOW LEVEL IN FACT INFRACTIONS WE'RE AT THE POINT NOW WHERE I HOPE WITHIN THE NEXT COUPLE OF WEEKS WE'RE GOING TO GO ONLINE AND OUR FIRST TWO QUARTS. WHAT WILL HAPPEN IS INDIVIDUALS IN THOSE TWO COUNTIES IN THE FOR OUR FIRST TWO COUNTIES ARE ARE SHASTA AND TULARE INDIVIDUALS CAN GO ON A AND USE AN ONLINE TOOL? IF THEIR RECIPIENTS OF PUBLIC DEFENDANTS UP PUBLIC BENEFITS EXCUSE ME THE AUTOMATICALLY RECEIVE -- AT LEAST A 50% REDUCTION THAT WILL BE THE RECOMMENDATION TO THE TOOL THAT A THAT A JUDICIAL OFFICER WILL CONSIDER AND THEN IN IN OTHER COUNTIES THE AMOUNT -- THE AMOUNT WILL GO UP I ALSO WANT TO POINT OUT THAT IN THE LAST YEAR'S BUDGET -- THE LEGISLATURE INCLUDED AND GOVERNOR INCLUDED ADDITIONAL FUNDING -- TO EXPAND THAT PILOT TO THREE MORE COUNTIES AND SO OUR HOPE IS THAT BY THE END OF THIS YEAR WE WILL BE UP AND RUNNING WITH THE ABILITY FOR PEOPLE TO JUST GO ONLINE. AND GET AN ABILITY TO PAY DETERMINATION THOSE COUNTIES ARE CHEST AND TULARE AS I MENTION SAN FRANCISCO VENTURA SANTA CLARA MONTEREY ELDORADO AND FRESNO. SO SIGNIFICANT REPRESENTATION OF THE STATE -- AND THEN ALSO A COUPLE OF COUNTIES THAT HAVE PRETTY SIGNIFICANT POVERTY LEVELS AND SO WE HOPE THAT THAT WILL BE FAR REACHING. TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT THAT MANY HAVE SPOKEN ABOUT THIS MORNING -- ANOTHER ANOTHER BILL THAT I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THAT WAS ENACTED LAST YEAR THAT'S GOING INTO EFFECT -- WENT INTO AFFECTS HIS MADE TO BE NAMED JANUARY'S INCREASING THE AMOUNT THAT PEOPLE RECEIVE A CREDIT FOR COMMUNITY SERVICE AND SO ACROSS THE STATE WILL NOW BE TWENTY TWO DOLLARS. A MINUTE WAS SIGNIFICANTLY LESS WILL BE A BIT MORE CONSISTENCY ACROSS THE STATE TO MAKE THAT A MORE VIABLE OPTION -- FOR PEOPLE WHO WHO ARE IN A POSITION TO DO COMMUNITY SERVICE. AS YOU MOVE FORWARD IN THESE CONVERSATIONS I JUST HIGHLIGHT A COUPLE OF THINGS -- THAT WE ARE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT AND THINK ABOUT IT AT THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL -- ONE HAS TO DO WITH THE IMPAIR APPEARANCE OF IMPROPRIETY FOR JUDICIAL OFFICERS YOU KNOW IF IF THIS YOU KNOW A COUPLE PEOPLE EARLIER MENTIONED -- COURT CONSTRUCTION FEES RIGHT WE WANT TO WE WOULD LIKE TO AVOID A SITUATION WHERE SOMEONE MIGHT THINK THAT. A CERTAIN FINE OR FEE IS BEING IMPOSED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BECAUSE OF A BENEFIT THAT THE TRIAL COURT'S MIGHT SEE SO THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO TO TO AVOID GOING -- GOING FORWARD -- ALLOCATION COLLECTION AND DISTRIBUTION OF FINES AND FEES IS IS EXCEPTIONALLY COMPLEX -- AGAIN A COUPLE PEOPLE HAVE MENTIONED THAT BEFORE -- AND IT IT SAYS A DOCUMENT THAT IS CALLED THE TRIAL COURT REVENUE DISTRIBUTION GUIDELINES IT'S ISSUED BY THIS STATE COMPTROLLER EVERY YEAR -- THE IT'S OVER A HUNDRED PAGES IT HAS THREE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE CODE SECTIONS -- WITH HUNDREDS OF DIFFERENT VIOLATIONS SO IT IS EXCEPTIONALLY COMPLEX WHEN YOU BEGIN TO TO PEEL THE ONION TO SEE WHAT IT IS THAT THESE FINES AND FEES -- ARE ARE -- PROVIDING THE IMPORTANT GOVERNMENT SERVICES THAT ARE BEING PROVIDED -- THROUGH THESE FINES AND FEES. ANOTHER CONCERN -- THAT'S BEEN RAISED AT THE AT THE JUST FOR COUNCIL IS THE TOTAL COST OF FINES AND FEES -- AS I NOTED BEFORE WE'VE TAKEN SOME ACTIONS -- AT THE COUNCIL IN IN THE TRIAL COURTS IN ORDER TO MITIGATE SOME OF THE IMPACT OF THESE FINES AND FEES PARTICULARLY ON LOW INCOME -- DEFENDANTS AND SO THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE ARE WE ARE ALSO GREATLY CONCERNED ABOUT -- THE EXPANSION OF NON MONETARY SO PEOPLE ANOTHER VIABLE OPTION THAT THEY CAN HAVE -- AND THEN THE OTHER THING THAT THAT I WOULD I WOULD WANT A HOT HIGHLIGHT IS JUST THIS LOOK THE IMPORTANCE OF OF WHO IS AT THE TABLE AS THESE DECISIONS ARE BEING MADE RIGHT AS I AS I NOTED AT THE BEGINNING AND AS OTHER PEOPLE HAVE MENTIONED -- IMPORTANT LOCAL STATE JUDICIAL SYSTEMS ARE BEING FUNDED BY THESE FINES AND FEES AND SO AS YOU AS AS THESE CONVERSATIONS ARE BEING HAD IN THESE DECISIONS ARE BEING MADE. HOPE THAT THAT MANY VOICES ARE HEARD IN THAT ALONG ALONG WITH -- PEOPLE PROVIDING VOICES FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE IMPACTED BY THESE THESE HIGH FINES AND FEES -- FUNDING THAT IS DECREASED OR ELIMINATED FOR ALL OF THESE VITAL IMPORTANT A GOVERNMENT SERVICES. NEED TO BE BACK FILLED IN ANOTHER WAY RIGHT SOUL IS SO IT'S ONE THING TO SAY WE'RE GONNA CUT THESE FINES AND FEES AND IF THE FINES AND FEES ARE CUT FOR IMPORTANT PUBLIC POLICY REASONS THAT YOU ALL MIGHT MAKE. WE STILL NEED TO KEEP THE COURTS UP AND WE STILL NEED EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES WE STILL NEED THESE IMPORTANT THINGS -- THAT ARE HAPPENING IN COMMUNITIES RIGHT NOW THAT CALIFORNIANS EXPECT FROM FROM OUR GOVERNMENT. AND THEN THE LAST THING I WOULD HIGHLIGHT IS -- ON A CALL YOUR ATTENTION -- TO THE NATIONAL TASK FORCE ON FINES FEES AND BAIL -- CALIFORNIA PURCHASE WITHIN THAT ARE ADMINISTRATIVE DIRECTOR MARTIN HOSHINO PARTICIPATED IN THAT AND IT WAS A GROUP OF NATIONAL CORD EXECUTIVE LOOK AT SOME OF THESE ISSUES BECAUSE CALIFORNIA IS NOT UNIQUE. WHEN IT COMES -- TO IMPLICATIONS OF OF HIGH CRIMINAL FINES AND FEES AND SO DOES WHAT I CALL YOUR ATTENTION TO THAT DOCUMENT TO THAT MIGHT BE A RESOURCE THINKING. GOOD MORNING THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME ON THIS IMPORTANT TOPIC I AM MERRY BLOWER I AM THE ASSISTANT COUNTY EXECUTIVE OFFICER FOR NAPA COUNTY. FIRST OF ALL I WOULD LIKE TO THANK MISTER ROBLESS FOR SHARING HIS STORY. HIS GUTS TO GET UP HERE AND SPEAK TODAY BUT EVEN MORE IMPORTANTLY HIS COURAGE OF OVERCOMING THE OBSTACLES THAT HAVE BEEN IN FRONT OF HIM FOR HIS WHOLE LIFE. I'M HERE TODAY TO TALK BRIEFLY ABOUT THE SERVICES PROVIDED BY COUNTIES WHICH ARE IN SMALL PART FUNDED BY THE FINES AND FEES THAT WE'VE BEEN DISCUSSING HERE TODAY. THESE INCLUDE NOT ONLY COURT ORDERED FINES AND PENALTIES BUT CASA SUPERVISION CHARGE MY PROBATION DEPARTMENTS AND FEES FOR LEGAL SERVICES FOR THOSE REPRESENTED BY THE PUBLIC DEFENDER. WHICH ARE BASED ON THE ABILITY TO PAY AN ARE SET BY COUNTY BOARDS OF SUPERVISORS. TO GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE NAPA COUNTY PROBATION AVERAGES ABOUT ONE HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND PER YEAR. IN REVENUE FROM COURT FINES AND SUPERVISION PHASE WHICH IS 1% OF OUR PROBATION BUDGET. A PUBLIC DEFENDER HAS ABOUT TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND PER YEAR OF REVENUE OR 3% OF THEIR ANNUAL BUDGET. REVENUE SOURCE WHICH HAS REMAINED STAGNANT WALL THE EXPENSES CONTINUE TO GROW. CAN NAPA COUNTY FOR EXAMPLE THE PUBLIC DEFENDER AND CONFLICT CANCEL SERVICES BUDGETS WHICH COVERS FOUR LEVELS OF CONFLICT. COSTS SIX POINT ONE MILLION DOLLARS THIS FISCAL YEAR. WITH THIS WE PROVIDE QUALITY DEFENSE COUNSEL SERVICES FOR ADULT AND JUVENILE PROCEEDINGS. AS WELL CIVIL PROCEEDINGS SUCH AS CHILD SUPPORT HEARINGS. WE ALSO HAVE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES CASE MANAGEMENT STAFF EMBEDDED WITHIN THE PUBLIC DEFENDER'S OFFICE. TO ENSURE THAT THE CLIENTS GET START GETTING THE APPROPRIATE PROGRAMMING AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE WITHIN THE PROCESS. OUR PROBATION DEPARTMENT NOT ONLY PROVIDES PRE SENTENCE INVESTIGATION AND SUPERVISION OF INDIVIDUALS SENTENCED TO PROBATION. THEY ALSO PROVIDE EVIDENCE BASED PROGRAMS KNOWN TO ADDRESS COMMITTED GENIC FACTORS WITH THE GOAL OF REDUCING RECIDIVISM. THIS INCLUDES FUNDING FOR IN AN OUTPATIENT TREATMENT SERVICES FOR MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS. AS WELL AS COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPY MORAL RECOGNITION THERAPY PARENTING SUPPORT VOCATIONAL TRAINING GED CERTIFICATION AND OTHER PROGRAMS PROVEN TO SUPPORT THE CLIENTS AND REDUCE RECIDIVISM. DESPITE INCREASING POPULATIONS AS A WHOLE COUNTIES IN CALIFORNIA HAVE NOT INCREASED CAPACITIES ARE LOCAL JAILS SIGNIFICANTLY. INSTEAD WE HAVE FOCUSED OUR LIMITED RESOURCES ON PROVIDING TREATMENT AND SERVICES THAT SUPPORT REHABILITATION AND REDUCE RECIDIVISM. AS THE SAFETY NET PROVIDER WE ARE MANDATED TO SUPPORT OUR MOST VULNERABLE RESIDENTS AND WE KNOW THAT FOCUSING ON COMPREHENSIVE SERVICES FOR OFFENDER POPULATION. ALLOWS THESE INDIVIDUALS TO OVERCOME THE CHALLENGES AND BECOME PRODUCTIVE MEMBERS OF OUR SOCIETY. WE HAVE SEEN FIRSTHAND THE ABSENCE OF THESE COMPREHENSIVE SERVICES. LEADS TO INCREASES ON THE DEMAND FOR OUR SAFETY NET SERVICES. LAST WEEK NAPA COUNTY WAS JOINED BY CONGRESSMAN MIKE THOMPSON SENATOR BILL DODD AND ASSEMBLY WOMAN CECILIA AGUIAR-CURRY TO CELEBRATE THE OPENING OF OUR NAPA COUNTY REENTRY FACILITY. THIS IS THE FIRST FACILITY IN THE STATE WHICH IS JOINTLY OPERATED BY CORRECTIONS A PROBATION DEPARTMENTS. AND A TRULY INTEGRATED SYSTEM A CARE IN IN. ENVISIONED TO SMOOTH THE TRANSITION FROM INCARCERATIONS COMMUNITY WITH INDIVIDUAL GLIDES CASE PLANS FOR EACH RESIDENT. WELL STATE LEASE REVENUE BONDS FUNDED THROUGH SET SB TEN TWENTY TWO OR SIGNIFICANT SOURCE OF CONSTRUCTION FUNDING. THE COUNTY'S COMMITMENT TO FROM THE OPERATE NO FUNDING PUBLIC SAFETY REALIGNMENT FUNDS APPROXIMATELY TWO AND A HALF MILLION A YEAR. IS JUST ONE EXAMPLE OF OUR COMMITMENT TO REDUCING RECIDIVISM AND PROVIDING QUALITY SUPERVISION AND TREATMENT SERVICES. ANY CHANGES IN THE REVENUE SOURCES TO THE COUNTY HAVE THE POTENTIAL OF IMPACTING OUR ABILITY TO PROVIDE THESE SERVICES THAT LEAD TO STRONGER AND HEALTHIER INDIVIDUALS AND THEREFORE STRONGER COMMUNITIES. THE SYSTEM OF COURT FEES AND FINES AS WELL AS THE SUPERVISION FEES COUNTIES CAN CHARGE FOR BOTH ADULT PROBATION SERVICES. ARE A SMALL PIECE OF A MUCH LARGER PUZZLE AND AS SUCH ANY CHANGES TO THIS FUNDING STRUCTURE MUST BE CAREFULLY CONSIDERED. THE COURT FEES AND FINES ARE A KEY COMPONENT OF THE TRIAL REAL COURT TRIAL COURT REALIGNMENT PROCESS THAT BEGAN IN NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN WITH THE GOAL OF CREATING AN EQUITY AMONG THE VARIOUS COURTS IN THE FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES IN CALIFORNIA. THERE USED TO SUPPORT THE OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE OF TRIAL COURTS BOTH DIRECTLY TO THE COURTS AS WELL AS THROUGH COUNTY MAINTENANCE OF EFFORT AND COURT FACILITY FEE PAYMENTS. IN ADDITION TO DIRECTLY SUPPORTING THE JUSTICE SYSTEM. THESE FUNDS ALSO WERE SPECIFICALLY IDENTIFIED FOR TRAINING OF LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT DETENTION OF PROBATION STAFF. THROUGH PEACE OFFICER STANDARDS AND TRAINING TRUST FUND AND THE STANDARDS AND TRAINING FOR CORRECTIONS TRUST FUNDS. BOTH OF WHICH HAVE FAILED TO MEET THE COUNTY COSTS FOR THESE TRAINING REQUIREMENTS FOR SEVERAL YEARS. THE COUNTIES CONTINUE TO SUBSIDIZE THIS TRAINING. ALL THESE FEES PLAY A VITAL ROLE IN SUPPORTING OUR SYSTEM OF JUSTICE THE COLLECTION OF THESE FEES IS NOT AGGRESSIVE. AS WE'VE HEARD RESTITUTION IS THE FIRST PRIORITY. THE PROBATION SUPERVISION FEE CHARGED BY NAPA COUNTY IS TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY DOLLARS PER YEAR. AND NOT ONLY DO THEY SUPPORT THE STAFF TIME BUT THE DIRECT COSTS SUCH AS CHEMICAL TESTING AN ELECTRONIC MONITORING. THE INTENT OF THESE FEES IS NOT TO RECOVER THE COST OF THE SERVICES. BUT AS ONE TOOL IN HOLDING THE OFFENDER FOR THEIR ACTIONS. NON PAYMENT OF FEES ARE FIND IS NOT GROUNDS FOR A VIOLATION OF PROBATION. NAPA COUNTY IS COMMITTED TO PROVIDING QUALITY SERVICES TO ALL OF OUR RESIDENTS INCLUDING THOSE INVOLVED IN THE JUSTICE SYSTEM. AS PARTNERS WITH THE STATE IN THIS JUSTICE SYSTEM COUNTIES NEED TO BE ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN ANY CHANGES THAT IMPACT THE CONVOLUTED SYSTEM OF FEES AND FINES. AS IT WILL IMPACT THESE VERY CRUCIAL PROGRAMS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. MISSED CALL MARKET OF I JUST WANTED TO SORT OF RESPOND TO A SOME STATEMENTS THAT MS KARAN -- MENTION HE I THINK IT WOULD BE A FALSE CHOICE TO SUGGEST THAT CUTTING FINES AND FEES ALSO WOULD EQUATE CLOSING COURT -- AND I KNOW THAT'S NOT EXACTLY WHAT YOU SAID BUT THERE WAS AN INFERENCE -- YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW THAT THE FINANCIAL SUSTAINABILITY IN THE MANAGERIAL EFFICIENCY OF COURTS SHOULD BE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF DEFENDANTS. AND I ALSO THINK THAT AS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT COMMUNITY SERVICE -- YOU KNOW FINDING OTHER VIABLE OPTIONS FOR FOLKS TO PAY -- FOR THE FACT THAT THEY'VE DONE TIME FOR THEIR CRIME. ALSO BECOMES KIND OF CONCERNING. BECAUSE IN MANY INSTANCES WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE WHO ARE POOR WHO MAY BE MENTALLY FRAGILE. AND WHO ARE INDIGENT AND THEN BACK COMMUNITY SERVICE BEGINS TO CREEP SLOWLY. OR GO QUICKLY TO INDENTURED SERVITUDE -- TWENTY NINETEEN STYLE SO I THINK WE ALSO HAVE TO BE VERY CONSCIENTIOUS OF HOW ARE ALSO TRYING TO PRESCRIBE. COMMUNITY SERVICES WELL. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR SUPPORT [inaudible] JEFF -- OR OVERDRAWN BANK AND YOU SEE THAT. ARE. FIRST I WANT TO THANK THE UC REPRESENTATIVES FOR DOING A GREAT WORK YOU DO ONE MORE REASON WHY WE'RE SO LUCKY TO HAVE YOU SEE HERE -- SECOND -- SO. JUST LISTENING TO MISS BOWER'S TESTIMONY IT SOUNDED AS IF THERE MIGHT BE AN INTEREST IN NAPA COUNTY AND JUST. A LIMÃ³N -- EIGHTEEN THESE VARIOUS FEES IS THERE [inaudible] I'M. SO ARE COUNTY HAS NOT TAKEN THIS UP AS A AS A POLICY ISSUE OVER ALL BUT GENERALLY. WE WE ARE COMMITTED TO QUALITY PROGRAMS AND WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO HAVE THE RESOURCES TO DO THAT. IF WE CAN SIMPLIFY THIS FEE STRUCTURE WITHOUT HURTING OUR RESOURCES TO DO THAT WE'RE CERTAINLY INTERESTED IN BEING PARTIES IN THAT CONVERSATION OKAY BUT THE THE TWO PREVIOUS CANDIES ALAMEDA AND SAN FRANCISCO JUST ELIMINATING THEM -- SO WOULD YOU REQUIRE THE STATE TO REIMBURSE YOU OR HOW WHICH TO HOW WOULD THAT WORK. FOR FOR THE PROBATION IN THE PUBLIC DEFENDER FEES WHICH ARE UNDER THE BOARD'S CONTROL. THOSE ARE NINE WOULD NOT BE SUCH SIGNIFICANT IMPACTS THAT WOULD BE A COUPLE OF POSITIONS IN OUR COUNTY THAT WE WOULD HAVE TO PICK UP FROM THE GENERAL FUND. IN WE WOULD HAVE TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION WITH OUR BOARD OF SUPERVISORS. THE LARGER CONVERSATION OF THE THE FEES AND FINES THAT HELP US PAY OUR AMMO WE REQUIREMENTS TO THE COURTS AND SOME OTHER COSTS ARE MUCH MORE SIGNIFICANT. AND THAT'S HE PART OF RESTRUCTURING WE WOULD BE MOST INTERESTED IN I SEE SO THESE ARE THE STATE. MANDATED -- ARTS OF THE FINE IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. SO TO THE THE FINES AND THE FEES GO TO THE SOME COME TO THE COUNTY REVENGE COST SHARE SOME OF THAT BACK TO THE STATE SOME ARE KEPT BY THE COUNTY BUT WE HAVE A STATUTORY MOE REQUIREMENT. THAT WAS PART OF TRIAL COURT REALIGNMENT WE HAVE COURT FACILITY FEE PAYMENTS THAT ARE PART OF THE TRIAL COURT REALIGNMENT STATUTES. SO WE PAY A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THAT REVENUE BACK TO THE COURTS. AND AND YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE AWAY OUR REVENUE THAT PAYS FOR THAT THEN ARE YOU ALSO GOING TO TAKE AWAY THE EXPENSE THAT GOES WITH THAT. THAT'S A QUITE IT THAT'S QUESTION THAT'S A REQUEST THAT I ANTICIPATED -- SO DOES -- ON MISS CURRENT ON YOUR TESTIMONY -- DOES THAT. REFLECT THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL OR JUST -- THE SECTION ON CRIMINAL JUSTICE SERVICES. I I WORK FOR THE JUST COUNCIL SO YES THE JUST THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL. IF WE WERE TO ELIMINATE A LOT OF THESE. FINES AND FEES THAT THE STATE MANDATES WHAT WOULD THE COURTS NEED TO REMAIN WHOLE. I WOULD NEED TO GO BACK AND HAVE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE PEOPLE IN OUR FISCAL SHOP -- TO TO COME UP WITH A A SPECIFIC NUMBER OKAY BUT IT'S NOT ZERO IT'S NOT ZERO KNOWN ON A PROBABLY MANY MILLIONS OF DOLLARS YES OKAY AS MANY MILLIONS OF DON'T KNOW THE SAID THIS. BRINGS UP THE THE ISSUE THAT THAT I'M MENTION WHEN I FIRST GOT HERE -- SO I MEAN THIS IS DIFFICULT THIS IS NOT EASY INVOLVES A BUDGET REQUEST. I'M CERTAINLY WILLING TO DO THAT BUT I THINK WE HAVE. TO IF WE'RE GOING TO GO FORWARD ON THIS WE REALLY NEED TO DO A BUDGET REQUEST. THAT'S ALWAYS DIFFICULT -- OTHERWISE THIS A PROBABLY JUST DIE IN APPROPRIATIONS IN THE ASSEMBLY OR SENATE -- UNLESS WE CAN. SHOW THAT WE CAN REPLACE SOME OF THESE NECESSARY FUNDS -- ARE WE GOING TO BE SEEING BILLS COMING FORWARD YOU KNOW MISTER CHAIR NO I HAVEN'T I HAVEN'T HEARD OF ANYTHING IN THE PURPOSE OF THIS HEARING. IS GONNA GENERATE CONVERSATION -- BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY THEIR OF THEIR WE'RE AND TAKE THIS INFORMATION AND THEN HOPEFULLY OTHER MEMBERS OF THE ASSEMBLY -- HERE. FROM THE EXPERTS HERE AND THEN THEY CAN MAKE UP TO MY WERE THAT THEY WERE TO MOVE FORWARD -- HOPEFULLY -- TO THE INDIVIDUALS WHO TESTIFIED BEFORE THEY THEY MAKE A DECISION ABOUT MOVING ON WITH THEY WITH THE BILL NOT I'VE GIVEN EXAMPLE -- BEFORE WE ARRIVED HERE IF YOU IF YOU REMEMBER MISTER QUIRK DURING THE HARD TIMES IT DIFFICULT BUDGET TIMES -- THE GOVERNOR MADE A DECISION TO REALLY HAMPER THE CONSTRUCTION FUND AND MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS WERE TAKING OUT OF THAT. AND I'M NOT SURE TO STAY FOR WAS EVER. REPLENISHED -- I'M GONNA ASSUME WE DIDN'T. WE DID LIVE UP TO OUR PROMISE THAT WE WOULD GET REACHED MAKE YOU WHOLE AGAIN. AND THAT'S WHY WE HAVE SUCH A BIG CHASM IN IN BUNDY RIGHT NOW BECAUSE THE DURING HARD ECONOMIC TIMES DECISIONS WERE MADE THAT WERE ADVERSE TO THE JUSTICES SO I'M I'M VERY SENSITIVE. TO MAKING SURE THAT WHATEVER WE COME UP WITH A WHATEVER COMES TO OUR COMMITTEE THAT WE WE DON'T HAMPER ANY PART OF THE PUBLIC SAFETY APPARATUS. I THINK THAT'S A VERY IMPORTANT POINT AND IT SHOWS THAT WHILE I WOULD SAY THAT. CERTAINLY FIND TO TO HIGH WHAT THE RIGHT LEVEL IS I'M NOT SURE AND CERTAINLY -- THESE FEES -- WOULD BE BETTER OFF WITHOUT THEM. AND BUT IT'S IT'S SOMETHING THAT. IS GOING TO REQUIRE A LOT OF TIME AND EFFORT WORK WITH THE GOVERNOR IT CETERA -- I THINK IT'S WORTH WHILE FOR THOSE OF US IN THIS COMMITTEE. ARM TO THINK ABOUT -- WHAT WE SHOULD DO WHAT THE BUDGET ASKED WITH DATE BE -- TO AND WHAT YOU -- IN RELATION TO HAVING THE COUNTIES NOT UP HERE SCREAMING BLOODY MURDER. AND THE COURTS IT CETERA SO THERE'S JUST A LOT OF WORK TO DO AND I'M CERTAINLY WILLING TO PARTICIPATE. THANK YOU CAN JUST AS A NEW MEMBER HERE YOU KNOW I WASN'T PART OF THESE DEBATES YEARS PRIOR -- BUT I THINK TODAY HAS ILLUMINATED FOR ME WHAT I THOUGHT GOING IN -- BUT IS GIVEN MORE CONTEXT TO THE THE DISCRIMINATION AROUND THE FINES AND FEES IN PARTICULAR IMPACTING LOW INCOME. COMMUNITIES IN COMMUNIIES OF COLOR AND IT'S NOT MAKING OUR STREETS SAFER AND IT'S NOT ACTUALLY IT SEEMS GOOD FISCAL POLICY -- FOR FOLKS ARE TRYING TO RECOUP THESE FEES RIGHT SO I WANT TO BE A PART OF THE SOLUTION. WORKING WITH YOU ALL AND WORKING WITH ADVOCATES MOTHERS TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE FIX THE PROBLEM BUT I UNDERSTAND THE CHALLENGES BUT I THINK. IT FROM MY FINANCING COMPONENTS TO FIGURE OUT THE SOLUTION TO THIS. AND I THINK WE CAN. WITH ALL THE MINES COME TOGETHER AND I I WOULD DEFINITELY -- IMPLORE -- SOME WITH THE EXPERTISE LIKE MR LACKEY FROM THE CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY PATROL ACTUALLY KNOWS -- PROBABLY GIVEN A TICKET OR TWO IN HIS LIFETIME DIDN'T. THAT KNOWS. THE RIGHT WAY TO DO IT AND AND HOW. IT IMPACTS INEFFICIENT WAY AND SO WHAT BY AT I THINK THE GREAT THING ABOUT THIS COMMITTEE. IS WE HAVE A LOT OF MINES DEBT THAT HAVE SOME EXPERTISE AND WE CAN. PROBABLY LOWER BEFORE WITH THEIR WITH A WELL THOUGHT OUT ANSWER. OKAY. SO THANK YOU. AND NOW WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A PUBLIC COMMENT [inaudible] OR NOT. BUT THEM MIKE IS OPEN -- DEPENDING ON HOW MANY PEOPLE COME UP. IT'S EITHER GOING TO BE NAME AND ORGANIZATION [inaudible] AS SOARING TO NAME AN ORGANIZATION BECAUSE OF GET ON UP JUST A CITIZEN -- WELCOME FOR NEW. AND AND THE PROBLEM WE HAVE IS THAT IF YOU REALLY LOOK BACK AT BOOK [inaudible] AB. TWO THIRTY THREE OKAY ENACTED IN. NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN IT WAS THE TRIAL COURT FUNDING ACT.
