THAT'S HOW PLEASE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS FOR THE RECORD MY NAME'S ELAINE HELL IN CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR -- STATUS REPORT WE CURRENTLY HAVE TWELVE AUDITS THAT WERE APPROVED BY THIS COMMITTEE -- AIR THE PREVIOUS COMMITTEE IN AUGUST OF LAST YEAR BUT PRIMARILY THE OBVIOUS THAT -- ARTISTS THAT WERE APPROVED THIS. THIS PAST MARCH -- THE MOST RECENT AUDIT WE COMMENCED AS THE AUDIT OF SEX CITY UNIFIED AS A COMMITTEE DIRECTED US TO DO WE WAITED UNTIL LATE MAY EARLY JUNE TO COMMENCE THAT ON IT BUT ALL OF THE WORK. THAT HAS BEEN APPROVED BY THIS COMMITTEE IS UNDER WAY -- THAT'S TWELVE AUDITS WE ALSO HAVE A STATUTORY AUDIT THAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON WITH RESPECT TO THE STATE'S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- THAT ON IT SHOULD BE COMPLETED WITHIN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS -- AS AS YOU CAN SEE THE AGENDA TODAY HAD EIGHT ITEMS WITH THE CONSENT CALENDAR BEING APPROVED -- THERE WILL BE FIVE REMAINING ITEMS TO BE HEARD BY THE COMMITTEE MY STAFF RESOURCES AT THIS POINT FOR JULY AND AUGUST SINCE IT'S THE END OF JUNE WE ESTIMATED HOW MANY AUDITS WE CAN START BETWEEN NOW AND THE END OF AUGUST. WE CAN START SIX AUDITS ESSENTIALLY HAVE STAFF AVAILABLE IMMEDIATELY TO START MOST OF THOSE AUDITS -- IN ADDITION AS THE COMMITTEE IS AWARE THERE WILL BE ONE MORE COMMITTEE HEARING -- TOWARDS THE END OF AUGUST TOWARDS THE END OF SESSION THIS YEAR ARE AT THIS POINT WE'RE ESTIMATING WE WOULD BE ABLE TO START AN ADDITIONAL NINE AUDIT SO I WILL HAVE MORE TEAMS FREEING UP. OVER THE COURSE OF THE NEXT SEVERAL MONTHS AS WE RELEASE AUDIT REPORTS SO JUST WANTED TO GIVE THE COMMITTEE SOME CONTEXT SINCE WE CAN START SIX AUDITORY COURSE FOR THE NEXT TWO MONTHS. IF THE COMMITTEE DECIDES TO PROVE MORE THAN SIX I WILL START THOSE AUDIT AS STAFF FREE UP BUT THAT WILL STILL ALLOW FOR ADDITIONAL LOT IT'S TO BE APPROVED BY THIS COMMITTEE AT THE AUGUST HEARING. I'M ALSO JUST FOR MEMBERS INFORMATION ARE PART OF THE REASON WE DON'T HAVE QUITE AS MANY REESE SOURCES AVAILABLE THIS YEAR TYPICALLY WE HAVE MORE RESOURCES AVAILABLE FOR AN AUGUST HEARING. A COUPLE OF THINGS ONE IS REDISTRICTING -- AS I MENTIONED IN THE PAST WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR CREATING THE NEW CITIZENS REDISTRICTING COMMISSION -- WE HAD TO DRAW THREE NAMES TO ASSIGN STAFF AS OUR APPLICANT REVIEW PANEL. THOSE INDIVIDUALS HAVE TO BE AUDITOR'S WITH THE OFFICE WITH A MINIMUM OF TEN YEARS OF EXPERIENCE SO THAT MEANS I LOSE MANAGEMENT FOLKS AND WE PULLED THAT PANEL. THEY WILL BE COMMENCING THEIR WORK NEXT MONTH BUT WE'RE GONNA GET THEM AND SOME TRAINING SO I LOST ONE SUPERVISOR ACTUALLY LOST A DEPUTY WHICH HAD A RIPPLE EFFECT SO I HAD TO MOVE SOME PEOPLE UP. INTO ACTING POSITIONS ARE SO A LITTLE BIT OF A HIT IT'S TYPICAL HAPPENS EVERY TEN YEARS BUT I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THE COMMITTEE WAS AWARE OF THAT. THE OTHER -- REAP RESOURCE -- NOT I WANNA SAY CONSTRAINT BUT WE HAVE SOME STATUTORY ON IT'S WE ARE ALSO RESPONSIBLE FOR CONDUCTING ONE WE DO EVERY YEAR. IT'S OF CONTRACTING PRACTICES PROCUREMENT PRACTICES BY IN THE JUDICIAL BRANCH ON ONE YEAR IT'S FIVE JUDICIAL ENTITIES ON THE OPPOSITE YEAR WHICH IS THIS YEAR. OR REQUIRED TO GO IN AND AUDIT JUDICIAL COUNCIL THEMSELVES FORMERLY REFERRED TO AS A SEE SO WILL BE CONDUCTING THAT OUT WE HAVE TO START THAT ON IN JULY. BUT WE ALSO HAVE TWO NEW STATUTORY AUDITS THAT WE HAVE NOT BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR IN THE PAST ONE IS RELATED TO PROP FIFTY SIX WHICH WAS THE TOBACCO TAX INITIATIVE. THAT REQUIRED MY OFFICE TO DRAFT REGULATIONS TO DEFINE WHAT ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS WOULD BE THERE ARE A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT STATE AGENCIES THAT RECEIVE SOME OF THOSE FUNDS. TO ADMINISTER VARIOUS PROGRAMS -- IT VARIES FROM UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA GET SOME MONEY FOR RESEARCH -- DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION GETS MONEY FOR PREVENTION EDUCATING STUDENTS AND CERTAINLY DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH RISK RECEIVES FUN SO WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO PUT A TEAM TOGETHER TO CONDUCT SOME AUDIT WORK. WITH RESPECT TO TO THE USE OF THOSE FUNDS AND PARTICULARLY LOOKING AT ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS BUT THE STATUTE OR THE INITIATIVE ACTUALLY REQUIRES US TO CONDUCT A FINANCIAL AUDIT AND AND ACTUALLY DO SOME PERFORMANCE ART WORK AS WELL SO. WE WILL BE ASSIGNING A TEAM TO THAT. THE OTHER AUDIT THAT WE HAVE TO COMMENCE -- IS RELATED TO A STATUTE NOW I HAVE TO READ IT NATIVE AMERICAN GRAVES PROTECTION AND REPATRIATION ACT -- THIS IS SOME RESPONSIBILITY AT THE UNIVERSITY OF HAS THEY HAD TO COME UP WITH SOME POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THERE SOME THINGS THEY HAD TO PUT INTO PLACE THIS YEAR. WE ARE REQUIRED TO COMMENCE AN AUDIT AND TWENTY NINETEEN AND A SECOND AUDIT AND TWENTY TWENTY ONE SO AGAIN WE WE KNOW THAT WE'VE GOT TO DEDICATE AT LEAST ONE TEAM SOME RESOURCES TO THAT WORK. WE INTEND TO COMMENCE THAT WORK PROBABLY IN THE NEXT FEW MONTHS. BUT JUST FOR THE COMMITTEES INFORMATION JUST WANTED YOU TO UNDERSTAND THE NATURE OF SOME OF THE RESOURCES AND WHY WE'RE HAVING TO DEDICATE SOME OF THOSE TWO THAT STATUTORY WORKING CERTAINLY REDISTRICTING. BUT EVEN GIVEN THAT AS I SAID WE HAVE RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO START SIX AUDITS. WITHIN THE NEXT TWO MONTHS IN JULY AND AUGUST AND THEN WE'LL HAVE ANOTHER NINE TEAMS AVAILABLE FOR EITHER ADDITIONAL ARTISTS THAT ARE PROOF TODAY OR AUDITS THAT APPROVED AT THE AUGUST HEARING. WITH THAT MISTER CHAIR -- BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS MEMBERS MAY HAVE THANK YOU THANK YOU APPRECIATE THAT IN THE UPDATE ON THE CONTINUING -- WORKED THAT THAN REPORTS THAT WE SHOULD EXPECT WITH THAT LET ME ASK THERE'S ANY QUESTIONS ON THE STATUS REPORT. BY THE STATE AUDITOR FROM ANY MEMBERS OF THE DÃ­AS. HEARING AND SEEING NONE WE WILL MOVE INTO TODAY'S -- REGULAR CALENDAR. I BELIEVE -- SENATOR WIENER HAD ASKED -- TO PRESENT FIRST WILL HONOR THAT REQUEST -- CENTER WIENER IF YOU'D LIKE TO BEGIN. SO MEMBERS WE'RE STARTING WITH THE REGULAR CALENDAR IT'S NUMBER EIGHT TWENTY NINETEEN DASH ONE ONE EIGHT CALIFORNIA LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES AUTOMATED LICENSE PLATE READERS -- SENATOR WINNER WHEN YOU'RE READY TO BEGIN. I THANK YOU VERY MUCH I MISTER CHAIRMAN AND THANK YOU FOR ACCOMMODATING THE SCHEDULE ONE OF OUR WITNESSES BY ALLOWING US TO GO FOR A SWIM PRECIADO -- TO COLLEAGUES -- THIS -- AUDIT REQUESTS FOCUSES ON HOW DATA IS COLLECTED AND STORED BY PUBLIC AGENCIES THROUGH THE USE OF AUTOMATED LICENSE PLATE READERS. COMMONLY KNOWN AS A L. P. R.. LPARS SOPHISTICATED COMBINATION OF CAMERAS VISUAL PROCESSING SOFTWARE ANALYTICS TOOLS INSURABLE DATABASES. IT AUTO DETECTS LICENSE PLATE NUMBERS ON CARS THAT PASS A GIVEN LOCATION -- FOR EXAMPLE A CAMERA ATTACHED TO A LIGHT POSTS ON A ON A PUBLIC STREET. TRANSLATES -- THAT DATA INTO A FILE OF LETTERS AND NUMBERS ACCOMPANIED BY THE DATE TIME. AND LOCATION -- WHERE THE LICENSE PLATE WAS CAPTURED AND IT CREATES? AN ENTRY IN A DATABASE -- THESE DATABASES HAVE BILLIONS OF POINTS -- LPARS USED BY TRANSPORTATION AGENCIES FOR PARKING ENFORCEMENT OF AS WELL AS BY LAW ENFORCEMENT TO ENHANCE INVESTIGATIONS BY TRACKING THE LOCATIONS OF CARS. THAT MAY BE RELEVANT TO AN INVESTIGATION -- WHEN USED APPROPRIATELY THE STATE -- CAN BE VERY USEFUL TO PUBLIC AGENCIES. BY EFFICIENTLY AND FORCING PARKING AND OTHER RULES -- OR SHARING DATA ACROSS JURISDICTIONS -- ONE HI WHEN A A CRIME HAS BEEN COMMITTED. HOWEVER WHEN MISUSED -- THIS DATA AND THE POWERFUL ANALYTICS SOFTWARE THAT A COMPANY IT. CAN BE USED AS A TOOL OF MASS SURVEILLANCE. AGENCIES WITH ROBUST LPR NETWORKS -- CAN USE ANALYTICS TO KNOW DRIVING HABITS AND PROJECTS WHERE A CAR WILL BE LOCATED AT A GIVEN POINT IN TIME -- THE TOOLS BUILT FOR LPR ARE DESIGNED TO STORE AND NOT TO DELETE DATA ON PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT IMPLICATED IN ANY CRIME OR VIOLATION OF THE LAW. AND THE THAN THEIR SHARE OF BILLIONS OF THE STORED DATA POINTS ACROSS AGENCIES WITHOUT ACCOUNTABILITY TO THE PUBLIC ABOUT WHERE IT'S BEING SHARED. INDEED THERE ARE ALREADY KNOWN EXAMPLES OF THIS TECHNOLOGY BEING USED TO TRACK PEOPLE. IN OUR IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES AND IT IS KNOWN THAT MILLIONS OF THESE DATA POINTS HAVE BEEN SHARED IN THE PAST. WITH ICE -- THERE THEN USE OF THE FEDERAL IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT CAN PREDICT WHERE A FAMILY OR INDIVIDUAL WILL BE. AT ANY GIVEN POINT IN TIME. GIVEN THEIR PAST DRIVING HABITS. IN -- TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN OUR COLLEAGUE SENATOR JERRY HILL -- AUTHORED IMPASSE SENATE BILL THIRTY FOUR WHICH ESTABLISH REASONABLE REGULATIONS FOR DATA COLLECTED THROUGH THIS RELATIVELY NEW TECHNOLOGY. THE REQUIREMENTS AND SB THIRTY FOUR FOR NOW THE LAW DO NOT BAN LPR INSTEAD THEY REQUIRE THEM PUBLIC AGENCIES USE LPR. THEY FOLLOW STANDARDS TO ENSURE THAT THE PUBLIC KNOWS THAT IT'S BEING USED IN A JURISDICTION -- AND HOW IT'S BEING USED AND STORED FOR EXAMPLE THERE ARE REQUIREMENTS FOR AN AGENCY TO HAVE A PUBLIC HEARING BEFORE PROCURING A CONTRACT FOR THIS TECHNOLOGY -- AND REQUIREMENTS TO PUBLISH WHAT THE POLICIES ARE -- FOR STORING AND SHARING THAT DATA. UNFORTUNATELY RECENT RECENT ENQUIRIES -- INITIATED BY THE ELECTRONIC FRONTIER FOUNDATION IN THAT YOU SEE ALL YOU HAVE ON COVER THEM -- VARIOUS LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES. THAT USE LPR HAVE NOT BEEN FOLLOWING -- THE LAW. I HAVE NOT BEEN HAVING HEARINGS ARE REQUIRED TO HAVE OR PUBLISHING POLICIES. ADDITIONALLY THERE ARE OTHER SITUATIONS WHERE AN AGENCY HAS ADOPTED A POLICY ON PAPER -- WHEN THE AGENCY MERELY COPIED AND PASTED A BOILER PLATE ORDINANCE FROM A COMPANY CALLED LEXICAL WHICH IS IN THE INDUSTRY? BOB MOST OF THESE AGENCIES OR MANY OF THEM ARE NOT FOLLOWING THEIR OWN POLICIES. LIKELY BECAUSE THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THESE BOILER PLATE POLICIES CONTAIN. THE GOALS OF THE AUDIT TODAY ARE TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE DEGREE TO WHICH LPR IS BEING USED BY CALIFORNIA LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES. AND THEIR WHICH VENDORS -- TO DO A DEEP DIVE ON FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES THAT USE THE TECHNOLOGY. IN ORDER TO ASSESS COMPLIANCE WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF SB THIRTY FOUR PARTICULARLY REGARDING DATA SHARING. AND TO DEVELOP LEGISLATIVE RECOMMENDATIONS IF THE IF NEEDED TO SEE IF WE NEED TO UPDATE THE LAW OR TIGHTEN IT UP -- I I APPRECIATE -- THE STAFF WORKING WITH US IN THE AUDITOR. I DO WANT TO NOTE ARE -- FOR CITIES AND COUNTIES THAT ON OR INCLUDED -- IN THIS REQUEST -- WE WERE -- WE WERE ASKS. TO SPECIFY THE FOUR CITIES BY THE AUDITOR BY THE COMMITTEE ON OTHERWISE FOR CITIES WOULD BE RANDOMLY SELECTED -- WHICH MAY NOT EVEN HAVE THE TECHNOLOGY -- AND SO WHAT WE TRIED TO DO IS SELECT GEOGRAPHICALLY DIVERSE CITIES WITH LARGE ON LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES SO THAT WE COULD GET A MEANINGFUL A SAMPLE OF WHAT'S GOING ON AROUND -- THE STATE -- SO WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE AND WITH ME HERE -- TODAY ARE -- DE MÃ¡S A SENIOR INVESTIGATOR WITH THE ELECTRONIC FRONTIER FOUNDATION AND KEVIN BAKER -- WITH THE ACLU. OKAY THANK YOU. WE HAVE A MOTION WE HAVE A SECOND WITH THAT WILL MOVE -- TO YOU SAID YOU HAVE WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OF WAR HERE BRIEFLY FROM WHAT THIS IS PART OF THE MOVE TO THE STATE WATER. PLEASE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE -- MY NAME IS DAVE MÃ¡S IN A SENIOR INVESTIGATIVE RESEARCHER AT THE ELECTRONIC FRONTIER FOUNDATION. WHEN ALL THE SLEEVE THE CAPITAL TODAY AND GET IN OUR CARS TO GO HOME WE WILL BE TRACKED USING AUTOMATED LICENSE PLATE READERS ALSO KNOWN AS A PR POLICE WILL SCANNER LICENSE PLATES TO DOCUMENT OUR LOCATION. TO GIVE AN IDEA OF THE SCALE IN TWENTY SIXTEEN TO TWENTY SEVENTEEN DRIVERS AS SACRAMENTO HAD THEIR PLATE SCANNED A HUNDRED AND NINETY FIVE MILLION TIMES BY POLICE AND SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENTS. THAT'S NEARLY TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY THOUSAND SCANS PER DAY. THAT DATA WAS UPLOADED TO THE CLOUD WHERE BECAME SEARCHABLE BY MORE THAN EIGHT HUNDRED AGENCIES AROUND THE COUNTRY FROM POLICE IN RURAL GEORGIA TO THE US BORDER PATROL. THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE STATE OF BELONGS TO PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT AND NEVER WILL BE CONNECTED TO A CRIINAL INVESTIGATION. THESE NUMBERS ARE NOT UNIQUE MASS ALE PR COLLECTION IS GOING ON ACROSS CALIFORNIA. AND YOU MAY WELL ASK HOW IS THIS DATA WHICH REVEALS ARE SENSITIVE DRIVING PATTERNS PROTECTED AND CONTROLLED. A YOU WON'T LIKE THE ANSWER. IN TWENTY FIFTEEN THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE PASSED SB THIRTY FOUR A FAIRLY BASIC LIST REGULATIONS THAT INCLUDES IMPLEMENTING A USAGE POLICY THE PROTECT CIVIL LIBERTIES AND PRIVACY. IN ANALYZING RECORDS FROM AGENCIES AROUND THE STATE WE HAVE DETERMINED AGENCIES ARE OFTEN FLOODING FLOODING THIS LAW. SOME HAVE BEEN PROMULGATED POLICIES OR IF THEY HAVE THEY ARE FOLLOWING THEM. MANY ARE CONDUCTING AUDITS WE'RE KEEPING THE REQUIRED LOGS OF WHEN THE DATA IS SEARCHED OR SHARED. WHETHER YOU BELIEVE LPARS USEFUL PUBLIC SAFETY TO OR NOT ONE MUST RECOGNIZE THE NEED TO ENSURE THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT ARE ACTING AS RESPONSIBLE STEWARDS OF OUR CONFIDENTIAL LOCATIONAL DATA. AT NEW LEGISLATION MAY VERY WELL BE IN ORDER BUT BEFORE WE CAN GET THERE WE NEED TO MEASURE THE SCOPE OF THE PROBLEM. THAT IS WHAT YET THAT SUPPORTS AN IMPARTIAL STATE AUDIT AND WE URGE YOU TO MOVE THIS SOLID FORWARD FOR THE SAKE OF EVERY DRIVER IN THIS ROOM AND EVERY DRIVER IN CALIFORNIA. PLEASE PROCEED GOING TO TURN MEMBERS KEVIN BAKER FOR THE AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION OF CALIFORNIA WE REVEAL THE USE OF THIS TECHNOLOGY BY LIFE'S THROUGH PUBLIC INFORMATION OR REQUEST -- THE SENDER WIENER ALLUDED TO LEGISLATURE HAS RECOGNIZED THAT THIS IS POWERFUL TECHNOLOGY IT HAS ADOPTED STANDARDS FOR MINIMUM STANDARDS AT LEAST FOR USE. I THINK THE ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE AT THIS POINT SUGGESTED THERE ARE SERIOUS QUESTIONS ABOUT COMPLIANCE UNFORTUNATELY I THINK THAT ARISES WHEN YOU HAVE A STATUTE THAT DOESN'T HAVE A ROBUST ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM -- SO I THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE THAT THE COMMITTEE CONSIDER THIS REQUEST AND LOOK AT THIS ISSUE FURTHER THANK YOU THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT WITH THAT WILL GO AHEAD AND MOVE TO THE STATE AUDITOR. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AS CENTER WIENER INDICATED. VERY FIRST OBJECTIVE IS REALLY ASKING US TO TRY TO GET STATEWIDE INFORMATION -- AND JUST TO REMIND MEMBERS WE'VE DONE ON ITS IN THE PAST WHERE WE HAVE HAD TO SURVEY LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT WE RECENTLY DID AN AN AUDIT ON HATE CRIME REPORTING IN CALIFORNIA WHERE WE WERE ABLE TO SURVEY. OVER TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY LOCAL ENTITIES IN SOME STATE ENTITY SO THAT WOULD IN ALL LIKELIHOOD BE THE APPROACH WE WOULD USE THIS TO TO FIND OUT BECAUSE CENTER WIENER IS IS INTERESTED IN HOW MANY LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ENTITIES ARE USING THIS. TECHNOLOGY WHAT POLICIES AND PROCEDURES DO THEY HAVE IN PLACE SO WE WOULD INTEND TO DO A SURVEY TO TRY TO CAPTURE THAT INFORMATION AND THEN CERTAINLY THE THE KEY OBJECTIVE IN IN THE HONOR. TO AUDIT REQUEST AND THE ANALYSIS THAT WE'VE PREPARED IS TO GO LOOKING AT THOSE FOR PARTICULAR ENTITIES. ACTUALLY THERE'S FIVE BECAUSE IN SACRAMENTO WILL BE LOOKING AT TWO SACRAMENTO COUNTY NEWS ALSO ASKED US TO LOOK AT DEPARTMENT HUMAN. ASSISTANCE BUT ALSO LAPD FRESNO -- PD AND MARIN COUNTY SHERIFF AT EACH OF THESE ENTITIES WE WILL DRAW DOWN WE CERTAINLY WANT TO KNOW WHAT THEIR POLICIES AND PROCEDURES ARE COMPARING THOSE TO THE STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS TO MAKE SURE THEIR POLICIES AT LEAST ALIGNED WITH. THE STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS AND THEN ALSO DETERMINE COMPLIANCE ESSENTIALLY ARE THEY HOLDING THOSE PUBLIC HEARINGS -- WHEN NECESSARY ARE THEY SHARING PUBLIC INFORMATION -- DO THEY HAVE PROPER PROTOCOLS IN PLACE TO PROTECT THE DATA -- AND IF THEY DO ARE THEY FOLLOWING THOSE PROTOCOL SO TAKING IT A STEP FURTHER AND ACTUALLY TESTING ARE HOW THEY ARE PROTECTING THE INFORMATION. IF THEY HAVE SOLD THEIR SHARE THE INFORMATION ARE CAPTURING THAT AND THAT. SITUATION BUT ALSO UNDERSTANDING WHO THEY SHARED IT WITH AND AGAIN IS THAT IN COMPLIANCE WITH STATE LAW WAS IT APPROPRIATE FOR THEM -- THEIR RESPECTIVE ENTITY TO SHARE THAT INFORMATION HE'S ALSO ASKED US TO LOOK AT SOME OF THE CONTRACTS WITH THE THIRD PARTY VENDORS WHO PROVIDE THIS TECHNOLOGY REALLY UNDERSTAND -- THE TERMS OF THAT ARE INCLUDED IN THOSE CONTRACTS AND ARE THOSE AGAIN IN IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE STATE AND AN ALLIANCE WITH. STATE LAW AND THEN THE FINAL OBJECTIVE IS REALLY LOOKING AT STAT THE STATUTE AS IT EXISTS TODAY AND BASED ON THE WORK THAT WE DO COMING UP WITH SUGGESTED. PERHAPS CHANGES OR MODIFICATIONS TO EXISTING STATE LAW. THE BUDGET FOR THE SIDE IS A LITTLE OVER TWENTY EIGHT HUNDRED HOURS THAT WOULD TAKE US ABOUT SEVEN MONTHS -- WITH ONE TEAM HOW WE MAY BE ABLE TO SPLIT IT UP IN AND GO WITH TWO TEAMS DEPENDING UPON HOW MANY AUDITS ARE APPROVED -- BUT AGAIN WE WOULD WE WOULD INTEND TO GO TO ALL OF THOSE ENTITIES AND CERTAINLY CONDUCT THAT STATEWIDE SURVEY TO GET MORE GLOBAL INFORMATION. WITH THAT MISTER CHAIR ON I'LL ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS MEMBERS MAY HAVE THANK YOU. THANK YOU THINK FOR PRESENTATIONS I'M GONNA MOVE -- TO THE AFFECTED AGENCIES I INVITE ANY REPRESENTATIVES FROM AFFECTED AGENCIES IS TABLE OUT FROM DATA BY THEMSELVES. THIS TIME WHEN WE ASK IF THERE ARE ANY AFFECTED AGENCIES FOR THE SOUGHT. WE HAVE A COUPLE. NGUYEN PLEASE PROVIDE SPACE THANK YOU. CIVIC PLEASE IDENTIFY YOURSELVES -- WHICH AFFECTED AGENCY OR WITHIN A FEW COULD -- LIMIT CHORE COMES TO TWO MINUTES. THE FANTASY. PLEASE IN THE MIKE. STEPHEN CAST WITH FRESNO POLICE DEPARTMENT. GIL. DE MORE SEE -- SIDE WHEN COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT. SURELY DAVIS DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN ASSISTANCE OKAY IF YOU LIKE TO BEGIN WITH YOUR COMMENTS PLEASE -- GOOD MORNING EVERYONE HE NOTED WHO I WAS I AM THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF FINANCE ADMINISTRATION. AND I'M REPRESENTING SACRAMENTO COUNTY -- DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN ASSISTANCE. INVESTIGATING AND PROSECUTING WELFARE FRAUD. IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE PROGRAM INTEGRITY DIVISION WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN ASSISTANCE. AND ONE TAKEN SERIOUSLY TO PREVENT WELFARE FRAUD. TO ENSURE THAT THE DESERVING ELIGIBLE CUSTOMERS IN OUR COMMUNITY RECEIVE THE RESOURCES AND BENEFITS THAT THEY NEED. INVESTIGATIVE STAFF BEGAN. USING THE AUTOMATED LICENSE PLATE READER SYSTEM THE L. P. R.. IN JUNE OF TWENTY SIXTEEN AND TERMINATED ITS USE EFFECTIVE NOVEMBER FIRST. TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE REASON THE DEPARTMENT DISCONTINUED THIS TECHNOLOGY WAS IT APPROVED TO HAVE LIMITED UTILITY TO THE INVESTIGATIVE STAFF. WE DECIDED THAT BASED UPON THE VERY LIMITED USE OF THE TECHNOLOGY THAT WE COULD ACCOMPLISH OUR MISSION TO DETECT AND PREVENT FRAUD WITHOUT MAINTAINING THE SERVICE SO CONSEQUENTLY. WE TERMINATED OUR CONTRACT AND WE HAVE NOT USE THE SYSTEM IN THE LAST YEAR. OR SINCE LAST YEAR [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] PLEASE PROCEED. THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBER SALAS FOR OPPORTUNITY BEER TODAY -- LIKE I SAID PREVIOUSLY MONEY WAS LIEUTENANT AND MORE SEE AND I'M THE ASSISTANT COMMANDER. OR DIVISION. SO THE AUTOMATIC. LICENSE PLATE READER PROGRAM OTHERWISE KNOWN AS ALPERS ONE OF THE MANY INVESTIGATIVE TOOLS USED BY THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT. LICENSE PLATE READERS ARE ANOTHER EVOLUTIONARY STEP FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT INVESTIGATIONS. PREVIOUS STEPS INCLUDE THE USE OF FINGERPRINTS RADIOS COMPUTERS AND CARS. WHICH ONE NOT EVEN THE THING WHEN I WAS A PATROL -- DIGITAL MAPS IN CAR CAMERAS AMBER ALERT TEXT MESSAGES AND EVEN DNA. TOOLS THAT ARE NOW REPRESENTED IN EVERY MODERN TELEVISION CRIME DRAMA WE'RE ONE SIGNIFICANT ACCOMPLISHMENTS. THE SECOND COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT INTRODUCED LICENSE PLATE READERS AT THE END OF TWO THOUSAND TWELVE SINCE THAT TIME THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT CONTINUE TO DEVELOP THE PROGRAM POLICIES PROCEDURES. TO UTILIZE LPARS WITH MUCH SUCCESS IN TERMS OF ENFORCEMENT INVESTIGATIONS. AS BURGER MATURE THE PERSONNEL IN SYSTEMS WERE TRANSFERRED TO THE FIELD SUPPORT DIVISION WHICH IS A CENTRAL CLEARINGHOUSE FOR ALL INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN USER AUTHENTICATION. ONCE SB THIRTY FOUR WAS ENACTED THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT POLICY NEEDED A FEW CHANGES TO COMPLY WITH THE REQUIREMENTS BUT THAT POLICY IS STILL REMAINS ACCESSIBLE ON OUR PUBLIC. FACING WEB PAGES BEEN THERE SINCE APRIL EIGHTH OF TWENTY SIXTEEN WE DO NOT USE LIKE SUPPORT WE WROTE OURS BASED ON BEST PRACTICES ACROSS THE NATION AS WELL AS UNDERSTANDING THE THE RULES AND AND RELATIONSHIP WITH PRIVACY WITHIN LAW ENFORCEMENT. THERE ME TIE SO PURE OPERATIONS BY LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES AROUND THE COUNTRY. WHEN THIS HEARING I'D LIKE TO EXPLAIN HOW LP OR IS USED BY PATROL OFFICERS INVEST IN INVESTIGATORS? TO BEGIN A LICENSE PLATE IS SIMPLY JUST ANOTHER DATA POINT FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT. BECAUSE IT IS A DATA POINT THE ENTIRE LP OUR ROCESS WORKS TO MAXIMIZE THE ACCURACY OF THE SCANT IN LAYMAN'S TERMS THAT MEANS INSTALLING THE CAMERAS IN A MANNER THAT IDENTIFIES LICENSE PLATES. AND NOT THE SUBJECTS THAT ARE DRIVING THE VEHICLE. THIS IS VERY DIFFERENT FROM A RED LIGHT CAMERA PROGRAM WHICH THE INTENT IS TO LINK A DRIVER TO A VEHICLE. ONCE A PLAYER SCANNED THAT DATA POINT IS THE PROPERTY OF THE SACRAMENTO COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT. AND VIGILANT SOLUTIONS ARE CONTRACTED BETTER HOST OUT IN A CRIMINAL. JUSTICE INFORMATION SERVICE COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS THAT MEANS THE DATA STORE AN ENVIRONMENT WHICH HAS VERIFIABLE SECURITY MEASURES. BECAUSE ART MY COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT APPROACHES LICENSE PLATE AS ONLY A DATA POINT. THE INVESTIGATIVE PROCESS NEED THE USE LOOK UTILIZE THAT INFORMATION STILL EXIST. FOR EXAMPLE IF A DEPUTY RECEIVED AN ALERT THE STORM PLATE THAT ALERT THE CELL DOES NOT COST TO PROBABLE CAUSE RESTED ISSUED A VEHICLE STOP. THE DEPUTY MUST MAKE SURE THAT THE SCAMPI IS CORRECT. BECAUSE A ZERO AND THE LETTER -- OR VERY -- EASILY IN ACTION -- MISTAKEN AND THEY LOOK VERY SIMILAR TO THE COMPUTER. THE DEPUTIES NEED TO MAKE SURE LICENSE PLATE MATCHES THE MAKE MODEL OF THE VEHICLE THIS REPORTED AS STOLEN. IS NOT UNCOMMON FOR THIEVES TO ATTEMPT TO AVOID DETECTION BY LAW ENFORCEMENT BY STEALING OTHER PLATES. FROM VEHICLES IN HOPES OF THE OWNERS ARE NOT ALERT ENOUGH TO RECOGNIZE TO CHANGE. ONCE A PLATE SCANNERS CONFIRMED THE MAKE AND MODEL OF THE VEHICLE IS CONFIRM IT UP WE MUST STILL VERIFY THAT THE STORE NOTIFICATION IS STILL ACTIVE. ONLY THEN CAN LAW ENFORCEMENT ACTION OCCUR. PEOPLE OFTEN GET STUCK ON THE FACT THAT MILLIONS OF LICENSE PLATE SCANS OCCUR BUT ONLY HAVE THESE FEW NUMBER OF THEM WORSE FLAG AT THE TIME OF THE SKIN PERSONALLY. I BELIEVE THAT'S A GOOD THING. IN HIS BOOK INTELLIGENCE LED POLICING DR JERRY RADCLIFFE IN CHAPTER THREE DISCUSSED HOW 6% OF THE CRIMINAL POPULATION ACCOUNT 460% OF THE CRIME CALLS FOR SERVICE. IDENTIFYING THOSE PROLIFIC INVENTORS AND INTERRUPTING THEIR ABILITY TO COMMIT ADDITIONAL CRIMES HAS LESS TO DO WITH TRYING TO SURVEIL THE MASSES MORE TO DO WITH STOPPING THOSE INDIVIDUALS. WHO LOOK TO VICTIMIZE SEGMENTS OF THE POPULATION? THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME THANK YOU. PLEASE ADDITIONAL TESTIMONY SURE -- GOOD MORNING AGAIN I'M WITH THE FRESNO POLICE DEPARTMENT. THE FRESNO POLICE DEPARTMENT HAS UTILIZED -- LICENSE PLATE READER TECHNOLOGY FOR APPROXIMATELY LAST DECADE -- MORE RECENTLY -- WE HAVE. CHANGED PROVIDERS AND BEGIN USING VIGILANCE LUCIEN'S THE SAME COMPANY THAT -- WITHIN A MORE SEE -- SPOKE ABOUT SO REPEAT A LOT OF THE THE POINTS HE MADE BECAUSE THEY'LL BE THE SAME -- BUT WE WENT TO COUNCIL IN APRIL OF TWENTY SIXTEEN FOR APPROVAL -- FOR THE USE OF LICENSE PLATE READER SERVICES FROM VISUAL SOLUTIONS -- THAT WAS APPROVED SO WE'VE BEEN USING THEIR SERVICES SINCE APRIL TWENTY SIXTEEN AND WE DEPLOYED OUR FIRST -- VIGILANT SOLUTIONS LICENSE PLATE READER VEHICLES -- IN -- I BELIEVE MAY OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN SO WE STARTED WITH -- TO TWO VEHICLES AND WE ARE NOW UP. TO EIGHT VEHICLES -- ONE VEHICLE IN EACH FOR POLICING DISTRICTS -- IS EQUIPPED WITH LICENSE PLATE READER CAMERAS UNMARKED POLICE CARS AND THEN WE HAVE THREE UNMARKED CARS ASSIGNED TO OUR AUTO THEFT TEAM -- THAT ARE ALSO EQUIPPED WITH THE LP OUR CAMERAS -- I CAN TELL YOU -- YOU KNOW ANECDOTALLY OUR OFFICERS AND INVESTIGATORS ESPECIALLY. LOVE THE SERVICE AND THE INFORMATION -- THAT IT PROVIDES -- OUR INFORMATION THAT WE COLLECT AS AN AGENCY IS -- CAP FOR ONE YEAR UNLESS IT BECOMES PART OF THE CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION -- AND AT THAT TIME IT'S PURGED FROM THE SYSTEM SO WE HAVE ACCESS TO OUR DATA -- THAT WE COLLECT -- AS AN AGENCY I BELIEVE THAT NUMBER IS AROUND -- IT'S IT'S NOT VERY HIGH BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE THAT MANY CAMERAS BUT I BELIEVE IT'S FROM ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION A YEAR -- WHAT WE CALL THE TEXANS -- OR SCANS -- AND AND THEN IT'S PURGED -- IN -- CONDUCTS WITHOUT THAT WE DO HAVE ACCESS TO THE LICENSE PLATE SCANS THAT ARE COLLECTED BY VISUAL SOLUTIONS A PRIVATE COMPANY -- SO WE HAVE ACCESS TO THEIR NATION WIDE LPR DATA. SO WHAT THAT'LL OF FISH. HI. THANK YOU. WE WE HAVE OUR FOURTH. AGENCY AFFECTED IF YOU CAN PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME AND AFFILIATION PLEASE A GOOD MORNING MY NAME'S LIEUTENANT DAN GOMEZ ON WITH THE LOS ANGELES POLICE DEPARTMENT. AND I OVERSEE THE LPR PROGRAM FOR THE DEPARTMENT -- WE'RE PROBABLY THE THE AC THAT HAD AT ONE OF THE LONG AS WE START OUR PROGRAM AS EARLY AS TWO THOUSAND SIX AND WE'VE BEEN RUNNING IT -- CONCURRENTLY OF SINCE THAT TIME -- THE THE SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE ARE NOT VIGILANT WE'VE HAD THE SAME VENDOR THE ENTIRE TIME IT'S COMPANY CALLED TIPS TECHNOLOGY. WE DO NOT -- PUT ANY OF OUR DATA INTO THE CLOUD TODAY EVERYTHING IS HOUSE. IN OUR OWN DATABASES WHICH IS A C. JUST COMPLIANT DATABASES WOULD RELEASE THE MENTION BY ANOTHER ORGANIZATION -- WE FIND THE INFORMATION COMPLETELY VALUABLE FROM AN INVESTIGATIVE STANDPOINT IT WAS FUNDED COMPLETELY ALL OF OUR LPARS HAVE BEEN FUNDED THROUGH THE URBAN AREA SECURITY INITIATIVE -- SO WE'VE HAD PUBLIC HEARINGS EVEN PRIOR TO THE LOBBYING ENACTED WE HAD PUBLIC HEARINGS BOTH ON ITS PROCUREMENT AS WE EXPANDED INTO SOME OF OUR COMMUNITIES -- THROUGH OTHER GRANTS -- THROUGH OUR HOUSING AUTHORITY GRANTED WE ALSO HAD PUBLIC HEARINGS BOTH IN OUR HOUSING COMMUNITIES IN OTHER AREAS THAT WERE AFFECTED AND THIS IS AGAIN ALL PRIOR TO THE LOBBYING -- IMPLEMENTED SO WE WE FEEL COMFORTABLE IN THE PROCESS AND MATTER IN WHICH WE'VE DONE IT -- ALL THE CHIEFS AND I'VE OF COURSE I GOT THROUGH A FEW CHIEF SINCE I'VE BEEN THERE -- HAVE BEEN SUPPORTER OF THE OF THE PROGRAM AND WE CONTINUE TO ENSURE THAT WE ABIDE BY BOTH THE LAWS THAT ARE IN PLACE -- WE PROTECT ALL THE DATA AS INVESTIGATIVE DATA -- SO WE DON'T RELEASE DATE -- WE EVEN AS PART OF OUR IMPLEMENTATION BECAUSE WE WERE SO EARLY. WE WERE AHEAD OF THE MATURING OF THE TECHNOLOGY IN THE SOFTWARE SO WE DID PARTNER WITH A THIRD PARTY VENDOR VENDOR TO HAVE AN OVERLAY SOFTWARE. THAT AT THAT TIME REQUIRED PEOPLE TO ENTER IN WHY THEY WERE SEARCHING IF IT WAS PART OF THE CASE IT WOULD GIVE US AUDIT ABILITY AND THAT AGAIN WAS PRIOR TO THE LOBBYING -- IMPLEMENTED AND WE STILL USE THAT PRACTICE TODAY SO WITH THAT I I THINK THE MEMBERS THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY. THIS TIME LET'S GO TO MOVE TO QUESTIONS ON THE DÃ­AS AND WE WILL BEGIN WITH SENATOR MINING. THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIR I WANT TO THANK. THE SENATOR FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD. APPRECIATE THE SERVICE OF ALL OF THOSE HERE REPRESENTING AGENCIES I THINK. WHAT'S OFTEN STANDARD IN THESE -- AUDIT COMMITTEE HEARINGS THOSE TO HEAR SOME. DIRECT RESPONSE TO THE PROPOSED BOUGHT IT IN I DIDN'T REALLY HEAR THAT FROM MANY I THINK YOU TALKED ABOUT YOUR USES -- IN MAYBE SOME REFERENCE TO COMPLIANCE BUT OFTEN WE HEAR RESPONDENTS -- WELCOMING ON IT TO HELP IMPROVE -- COMPLIANCE WITH WITH STANDARDS. SO I WOULD HOPE THERE WOULD BE THAT OPENNESS SHOULD THE COMMITTEE SUPPORT THIS AUDIT THAT IT'S NOT. AN INDICTMENT OF THE WORK YOU DO IT'S REALLY. A PARTNERSHIP TO TRY -- TO EXAMINE SYSTEMS AND COME UP WITH RECOMMENDATIONS THAT CAN BE HELPFUL. FOR THE LAW ENFORCEMENT PURPOSES OR THE PUBLIC PURPOSE SERVICES THAT YOU PROVIDE SO JUST KIND OF BE CLEAR HOW WE WORK AS A COMMITTEE IT'S WERE WERE NOT BRINGING YOU HERE TO SAY GOTCHA IT'S WE WANT TO KNOW HOW IS THIS WORKING. HOW DO WE MAKE SURE IT'S IT'S SUPPORTING ITS INTENDED -- PUBLIC SAFETY USE BUT AT THE SAME TIME PROTECTING PROTECTING THE PUBLIC INTEREST. OF PROTECTING PRIVACY INFORMATION SO ONE QUESTION MAYBE FOR THE AUTHOR OR FOR ANYONE WHO KNOWS. I'M NOT FAMILIAR WITH THE SPECIFICS SPECIFICS OF SB. THIRTY FOUR IT DOES WHAT DOES IT ALLOW IN THE WAY OF SHARING COLLECTED DATA IF YOU KNOW. YEAH AND I'M GONNA MAYBE ASK FOR MR MOSS TO COME BACK UP. AS WELL FOR GOOD [inaudible] THANK YOU. THE BAND SCHERING UPPER PUTS CONSTRAINTS ON IT SO. YEAH SO THE LANGUAGE REGARDING SHARING -- THAT -- PROHIBITS FIRST ALL SHARING IT WITH THIRD PARTIES SO NON GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES -- THE LANGUAGE DOES SAY THATNEEDS TO BE SHARED ONLY WITH PUBLIC AGENCIE DEFINED AS AGENCIES WITH IN CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU AND THEN ONCE IT SHARED SAY BETWEEN LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES THERE'S POTENTIALLY A PUBLIC INTEREST IN THAT BUT FOR THESE THIRD PARTY VENDORS. IN THESE CONTRACTS ARE THEY PROHIBITED FROM SELLING THAT INFORMATION TO COVER OTHER COMMERCIAL INTERESTS THE COMPANY ITSELF GENERALLY SAYS THAT THE DATA BELONGS TO THE AGENCY AND THAT IT IS NOT SHARED -- THERE'VE BEEN. ELLIS ALLEGATIONS OVER THE PAST THAT THAT DATA MAY HAVE BEEN MAKING IT TO THE PRIVATE SECTOR BUT I DON'T HAVE ANY -- DOCUMENTATION THAT THAT IS THE CASE ANYMORE SO I THINK WHAT WOULD BE HELPFUL IN THE AUDIT IS. TO TO FOCUS ON SHARING OF DATA AND WHAT ARE THE CIRCUMSTANCES -- OR SUBPOENAS EVER REQUIRED TO SHARE DATA WITH OTHER LAW ENFORCEMENT OR PROSECUTORIAL ENTITIES WE IN CALIFORNIA ALSO TAKEN SOME -- POSITIONS LEGISLATIVELY THAT ARE CALIFORNIA STATE LAW ABOUT CIRCUMSTANCES FOR COORDINATING WITH ICE AGENTS. SOME OF THAT COORDINATION IS PROHIBITED SOME OF IT IS ALLOWED AND PROTECTED PURSUIT OF A FELON IS NOT PROHIBITED. BUT ONE OF THE INTRODUCTIONS WAS SHARING INFORMATION WITH ICE I'D BE CURIOUS OF THAT VIOLATES CALIFORNIA LAW IN TERMS OF WHAT WE HAVE. DEFINED AS APPROPRIATE COORDINATION WITH ICE ANA OR NOT. SO AGAIN I THINK THE THE AREAS OF CONCERN FOR ME. ARE EITHER COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION OF THIS DATA. TO FROM THE THIRD PARTY VENDORS OR THE AGENCIES WITH ANY OTHER ENTITY THAT MAY HAVE A COMMERCIAL INTEREST IN KNOWING. WHAT ARE MY DRIVING HABITS WERE MINE I STOP? FOR GASOLINE -- OR RESTAURANT WHEN I'M DRIVING AND I FIVE I GET ALERTS TELLING ME ABOUT A RESTAURANT THAT'S UP IN THE NEXT. EXIT MY CAR'S FEEDING THAT INFORMATION SOMEBODY'S HARVESTING IT. AND THEN TRYING TO GET ME TO STOP. THE RESTAURANT IT'S IT'S REALLY RATHER AMAZING SO AGAIN WE WANT TO PROTECT THE APPROPRIATE LAW ENFORCEMENT USE TO PROTECT PUBLIC SAFETY. I WOULD HOPE THAT AGENCIES HERE TODAY AND THE OTHERS IDENTIFIED IN ON IT WOULD. SEE THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO FORTIFY SYSTEMS TO BE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE LAW. WITH THE GOAL OF PROTECTING BOTH PUBLIC SAFETY. AND PUBLIC PRIVACY SODA WITH THAT I'D BE WILLING I WILL BE SUPPORTIVE YES DID YOU I JUST WANTED AND THEN -- YOU KNOW WHAT I SAID SO -- THE MARION COUNTY SHERIFF AND THE SAN FRAN FAIL POLICE DEPARTMENT DO CONTRACT WITH A THIRD PARTY TO DO ANALYSIS OF ITS DATA I DON'T KNOW. WHAT HAPPENS TO IT AFTER IT'S IN THE HANDS OF THE THIRD PARTY -- AND MEANWHILE THE OAKLAND POLICE DEPARTMENT HAS HISTORICALLY PROVIDED A DUMP OF ITS LICENSE PLATE READ AT READER DATA IN RESPONSE TO CALIFORNIA PUBLIC RECORDS ACT SO THE NEWSPAPER OURS TECHNICAL GOT SEVERAL YEARS WORTH OF THIS RAW DATA. WE ONLY ASK FOR SEVEN DAYS SO WE CAN ANALYZE IT AND WE IMMEDIATELY RECOGNIZE THE PRIVACY IMPLICATIONS OF THEM RELEASING IT IN THAT FORM. WELL THANK UNIT I WOULD HOPE. THOUGHT IT WOULD LOOK AT THE LIFE SPAN OF THE DATA NO SACRAMENTO MENTION THEY DESTROYED AFTER A CERTAIN. PERIOD OF TIME BUT I THINK THAT'S THE LEGITIMATE PRIVACY INTERESTS IS. WHO ELSE MAY HAVE ACCESS TO THIS DATA AND FOR WHAT PURPOSE ARE THEY SEEKING TO ACCESS IT -- SO WITH THAT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I THINK RESTAURANT AT THIS TIME -- MOVED TO CENTER BORE JUSTIN TO ASSEMBLY WOMAN RUBIO. THANK CHAIRMAN -- I WANT TO KIND OF FOLLOW ALONG THE LINE OF MY COLLEAGUE FROM -- FROM CARMEL THE HOW MANY CITIES OR JURISDICTIONS USE A. L. P. R. RIGHT NOW. I HAVE DOCUMENTED A MINIMUM OF A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY BUT I BELIEVE THAT'S A LOW NUMBER THAT'S JUST BASED OFF OF US. GOING WEBSITE BY WEBSITE LOOKING FOR AUTOMATED LICENSE PLATE READER POLICIES OR DIGGING THROUGH PROCUREMENT DATA -- SO IT'S THAT IS THAT IS THE LOW ONE WE'VE RECEIVED RECORDS FROM SIXTY AGENCIES WHICH ACCOUNTS FOR MORE THAN A BILLION LICENSE PLATE SCANS I WOULD ADD THAT -- WE'VE YET TO FIND -- SB THIRTY THIRTY FOUR POLICY ON THE LOS ANGELES POLICE DEPARTMENT'S WEBSITE -- SO I JUST WANT TO KNOW THAT THAT IS ONE OF THE REASONS THAT WE ARE INTERESTED IN SEEING THE OUTCOME OF AN AUDIT OF THEM BECAUSE WE JUST DON'T KNOW HOW THEY'RE USING IT BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT COMPLIANT IN THAT REGARD. IN HOW MANY -- ENTITIES USE VIGILANT SOLUTION OR COMPARABLE. TECHNOLOGY. WE DON'T KNOW I THINK THAT -- THE WAY I THINK ABOUT IT IN THE SPECTRUM OF COKE AND PEPSI THEY TEND TO BE THE COKE AND THEN THERE IS NO PEPSI IT JUST KIND OF GOES DOWN TO MAYBE THERE'S AN RC COLA ISN'T SOME SAFE WAY BRAND. BUT BUT THEY TEND TO HAVE THE THE LARGEST MARKET SHARE AND ONE REASON FOR THAT IS THAT THERE'S ONLY ONE IT CERTIFIED TRAINING BY THE PEACE OFFICER STANDARDS AND TRAINING COMMISSION. FOR LICENSE PLATE READER TRAINING AND VISUAL SOLUTIONS HAS VAT. CERTIFICATION THEY'RE THE ONLY ONES ABLE TO GIVE THAT TRAINING AND THEREFORE IT IS DIFFICULT HAVE OTHER VENDORS COMING IN BECAUSE POLICE ARE ONLY GETTING TRAINED ON ONE SYSTEM WHICH OFTEN TENDS TO BE A SORT OF MARKETING SEMINAR SLASH TRAINING SEMINAR. OKAY ANNA AND CENTER I THINK ONE OF THE AS YOUR SERVICE HEARING THERE IS A LACK OF SORT OF COMPREHENSIVE DATA JUST BASIC INFORMATION EVEN HOW MANY CITIES ACTUALLY DO IT -- AND SO ONE OF THE PURPOSES OF THIS AUDIT IS TO DO THE STATE WIDE SAYS GENERAL LOG SO WE CAN GET A LAY OF THE LAND. AND THEN DO THE DEEP DIVE INTO AND A SUBSET. AND THAT'S REALLY WHERE I'M GOING WITH -- WITH MY MY MY QUESTIONS I'M NORMALLY A FIERCE ADVOCATE. A PROPONENT OF ASKING QUESTIONS GETTING INFORMATION. HI. THERE'S A LITTLE BUZZING IN MY EAR ON THIS ONE THOUGH. AND I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S IF IT'S BECAUSE FRESNO WAS CHOSEN AS A LOCATION -- RIGHT NOW WE'RE LOOKING AT LA AND FRESNO I THINK YOU MENTIONED SACRAMENTO AND MORAN. BUT THE TWO CITIES ARE THAT WE ARE GONNA BE LOOKED AT IN MORE DETAIL EARLY IN FRESNO. AND THAT KIND OF PEAKS MY INTEREST IN THE PEAKS MY INTEREST BECAUSE IT'S NOT UNCOMMON IT'S NOT UNCOMMON KNOWLEDGE THAT FRESNO -- HAS HAD -- POLITICAL LEADERSHIP -- IN THE PAST -- THAT HAS TRIED TO FIGURE OUT THE ROLE OF THE SHERIFF. AND LAW ENFORCEMENT LAW ON IMMIGRATION RELATED ISSUES MY COLLEAGUE FROM CARMEL POINTED THAT OUT SPECIFICALLY. ON THE VARIOUS CONFLICTS OF INFORMATION SHARED BETWEEN. OUR ENTITIES INVOLVING THE STATE. AND THE RULES THAT PERTAIN AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. AND SO MY CONCERN IS THAT THIS APPEARS TO BE A BIT NINE INQUIRY INTO THIS AREA OF PRACTICE AND STUDY. IS THERE ANOTHER REASON THAT THE THAT FRESNO WAS CHOSEN. THAT -- IT HONESTLY HAVE TO ANSWER THAT RIGHT NOW BUT IT IS CAUSING ME SOME CONCERN -- THAT -- THIS IS BEING BACK TOWARD INTO IMMIGRATION DISCUSSION NOT A TRADITIONAL LAW ENFORCEMENT PRIVACY RELATED TO REQUIRE ANALYSTS MR MAS TO FOLLOW UP. AS WOULD BE VERY TRANSPARENT THAT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'RE INTERESTED IN IS. COORDINATION WHERE WITH ICING USE OF THIS DATA. IN TERMS OF ICE SO EVEN THAT WAS AND I REQUEST WE'RE NOT HIDING FROM THAT THAT'S NOT THE PRIMARY REASON WE'RE DOING THIS THIS IS JUST. TRYING TO FIGURE OUT OVERALL HELLO WHERE IS THIS BEING USED HELL HELL PREVALENT IS THE OUR CITIES COMPLYING. AND COUNTIES AND AGENCIES COMPLYING WITH SB THIRTY FOUR ARE THERE ANY CHANGES IN THE LAW WE NEED TO MAKE THAT'S THE PURPOSE OF IT BUT ALL I HAD LITTLE TO MR MAS SO IT IN THE PROCESS SO FIRST WE WANT TO SPREAD THESE AROUND HE STATE. SO THAT WAS ONE OF THE REASONS WE WONDERED AND SEVENTY LOCATIONS USING RC COLA COKE AND PEPSI EXACTLY SO FRESNO IS ON THAT LIST SO WHEN WE STARTED RESEARCHING THIS WE RECEIVED A COPY OF THE DATA SHARING REPORT FROM. THE HAWTHORNE POLICE DEPARTMENT WHICH INDICATED THE DATA FROM HAWTHORNE WAS BEING SHARED WITH SOMETHING CALLED THE FRESNO FASHION MALL A FASHION MALL SECURITY WE DIDN'T KNOW WE DON'T KNOW WHO IS RECEIVING A STATE IT SOUNDED LIKE A PRIVATE ENTITY. WHEN WE ASKED HAWTHORNE THEY SAID WE DON'T KNOW TALK TO FRESNO POLICE DEPARTMENT SO BOTH EFF AND THE CENTER FOR HUMAN RIGHTS AND PRIVACY? PASSED FRESNO OVER AND OVER AGAIN WHAT IS THE DEAL WITH THIS AND WE NEVER RECEIVED ANY KIND OF RESPONSE. SO THAT WAS ONE OF THE THE EVIDENCE ON WHITE HIGHLY FRESNO HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH IMMIGRATION BUT BECAUSE WE WANTED TO UNDERSTAND WHETHER THERE WERE SECURITY GUARDS AT A MALL RECEIVING THIS DATA WHETHER THERE WAS A POLICE SUBSTATION AT THE MALL THAT WAS RECEIVING THIS DATA. I MEAN BECAUSE CERTAINLY I THINK WE'D ALL BE CONCERNED IF THERE WERE MALL COPS WHO WERE ABLE TO SEARCH. YOU KNOW PEOPLE'S LOCATIONAL DATA WITHOUT ANY OVERSIGHT FROM THE POLICE DEPARTMENT HELLO ALL IN MY QUESTIONS HERE I THINK I WOULD FEEL CERTAINLY MORE COMFORTABLE. THAT IF YOU HAD A STRONG URBAN INST AND RURAL -- SAMPLE. AND YOU CRATER THRESHOLD AND ESSENTIALLY -- LOTTERY DID IT AS A DECISION -- I WOULD FEEL FOR MORE COMFORTABLE YOU KNOW -- NOT THROWN BAKERSFIELD IN THE BUS BUT BUT SOMETHING ALONG THOSE LINES -- ONLY BECAUSE THE SELECTION OF OF THIS AREA GIVEN THE POLITICAL HISTORY -- I IS OF CONCERN. RIGHT THANK YOU AND YOU KNOW AND MY UNDERSTANDING IS WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR AS WELL AS AS WE'RE TRYING TO GET REGIONAL -- SAMPLES FROM ACROSS THE STATE ROLL URBAN. SO WITH THAT WE LIVE TO ASSEMBLY WOMAN RUBIO AND THEN TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER PATTERSON. THANK YOU FOR ME -- THIS IS NOW MY THIRD YEAR SITTING ON THE COMMITTEE I ALSO SEE IT AS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE DEPARTMENTS TO HIGHLIGHT HIGHLIGHT. THEIR THEIR GOOD PRACTICES IT'S NOT ABOUT A GOTCHA -- WE FOUND THAT SOME -- ENTITIES THAT WE'VE AUDITED IN THE PAST HAVE HAVE BEEN SQUEAKY CLEAN SO THAT WE CAN SAY HEY WE WERE AUDITED BY THE STATE AND WE WERE PERFECT BUT ALSO TO USE. THE MODELS OF THE THE AGENCIES THAT ARE DOING WELL AS YOU KNOW KIND OF A THE MODEL FOR THE REST OF THE AGENCIES THAT ARE USING AND SOUL. YOU KNOW I KNOW IT'S A DIFFICULT -- THING. TO HEAR IS THAT THAT YOU'RE BEING AUDITED BUT SOMETIMES YOU CAN USE THAT AS A POSITIVE IF IT IN FACT. ALLEY PD HAS IN ALL OF THESE PRACTICES AND YOU HAVE. MANAGED TO TO FOLLOW THE LETTER OF THE LAW AND REALLY HAVE A GOOD PRACTICE GOING IT WOULD BE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR OTHER AGENCIES THROUGHOUT THE OF WHAT THE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY ONE TO BE ABLE TO USE. YOUR PRACTICES AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO IMPROVE THEIR SYSTEM SO I ALWAYS TRY TO LOOK AT THE POSITIVE AND IF NOTHING COMES OUT OF IT THE AGENCIES CAN CERTAINLY. BLASTED ALL OVER THE INTERNET THAT YOU KNOW THEY WERE SQUEAKY CLEAN THE BY GOT AUDITED AND THEY'VE GOT A GREAT REPORT SO I ALWAYS TRY TO LOOK AT THE POSITIVE OF THAT. IT IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR YOU TO LOOK AT YOUR PRACTICE SAYS AND IF YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY CLEAN THEN BLASTED ALL OVER THE INTERNET AND SAY HOW AMAZING YOU GUYS ARE BECAUSE THE AUDITOR CAME AND YOU KNOW SHE FOUND NOTHING WRONG SO. FOR ME THAT'S ALWAYS -- THE REASON -- TO TO FOLLOW THROUGH ON SOME OF THESE OUT ITS OWN THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. THANK YOU WITH OUR MOVING TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER PATTERSON AND THEN TO SENATOR GONZALEZ. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR UP. CAN I HAVE ASK YOUR FRESNO COULD EXPLORE. THE PROCESS. GET THE AUDIT IS GOING TO BASICALLY LOOK AT THE PRACTICES AND ARE YOU -- IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE PARTICULAR UNDERLYING LAW CAN YOU LAY OUT HOW FRESNO. THE INITIATED TO THE TECHNOLOGY WENT THROUGH THE IMPLEMENTATION. AND HIGHLIGHT IF YOU CAN. THAT PROCESS AS BEING IN KEEPING WITH THE UNDERLYING LAW. SURE SO IN IN FRESNO LIKE I I MENTIONED WE WE'VE HAD -- P. R.. FOR I THINK ABOUT A DECADE I WAS A PART OF THAT BUT WE HAD AN OP OUR SYSTEM THAT WE USED IN CONJUNCTION WITH CLOVIS PD. AND ALL THAT DATA WAS WAS HOSTED -- AT CLOVIS BUT IT WAS A PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THE TWO AGENCIES. AND THEN MORE RECENTLY AS THE TECHNOLOGY EVOLVED -- WE TESTED DIFFERENT TECHNOLOGIES DIFFERENT LPR SOLUTIONS -- WITH YOU KNOW FIX READERS AND MOBILE READERS. AND FOR FRESNO WE DECIDED THAT MOBILE READERS WOULD -- GET US THE MOST BANG FOR THE BUCK BECAUSE AS YOU KNOW FRESNO IS HUNDRED FIFTEEN SQUARE MILES IT'S JUST SPREAD OUT. TO GET ANY KIND OF COVERAGE OF FIXED READERS -- WOULD HAVE BEEN A HUGE EXPENSE SO WE WENT WITH THE MOBILE READERS. AND ALSO WITH THE INTENTION OF USING THOSE TO ASSIST US WITH SOME OF OUR OUR INVESTIGATIONS -- SO WE HAVE A LARGE -- CRIME SCENE -- WE CAN ALWAYS ROLE AN LP OUR CAR THROUGH THAT SCENE TO ASSIST THE INVESTIGATORS LATER ON WITH -- WITH ANY VEHICLES THAT WERE IN THE AREA AT THE TIME OF THE CRIME. IT CETERA. SO WE DISCOVERED -- THE COMPANY VIGILANT SOLUTIONS THIS BEEN MENTIONED -- THE THE VALUE FOR US WITH -- MOVING FORWARD WITH VIGILANT WAS THE AMOUNT OF DATA THAT THEY BROUGHT TO THE TABLE AND PROVIDED. SO IN THE WHAT I'LL CALL THE GREATER FRESNO AREA -- THAT YOU KNOW INCLUDES THE SMALLER CITIES SURROUNDING FRESNO -- THEY DO AROUND A MILLION DETECTIONS A MONTH. IS WHAT VIGILANT PUTS INTO THE SYSTEM. SO IN ADDITION TO THAT -- THE DETECTIONS -- THAT OR A COLLECTED BY THE FRESNO POLICE DEPARTMENT CAMERAS ALSO ARE ARE ALL SEARCHABLE WITHIN THE SAME DATABASE -- USING THE SAME USER INTERFACE. SO THAT THAT HAD A LOT OF VALUE TO US HAVING ALL OF THAT INFORMATION IN ONE PLACE IN ADDITION WE HAD ACCESS TO VIGILANT SOLUTION DETECTIONS FROM ACROSS THE NATION SO. SO ALL OF THAT DATA WAS IN ONE PLACE -- YOU PAY A SUBSCRIPTION TO HAVE ACCESS TO THEIR DATA AND THEN -- YOUR DATA CAN GO INTO THE SAME SYSTEM -- THE LAW ENFORCEMENT DATA THAT GOES INTO THEIR SYSTEM I IT WAS MENTIONED EARLIER THAT DATA BELONGS -- TO THE LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY -- AND THAT'S NOT CO MINGLED WITH THE COMMERCIAL DATA -- FROM THE VIGILANT SIDE -- IT WAS MENTIONED BUT SENSE THAT THERE IS A SEPARATION THEN. BETWEEN TYPES OF DATA. YES AND THAT THE PROPRIETARY RESPONSIBILITY OF THAT DATA RESTS WITH THE FRESNO POLICE TO PARK -- YOU HAVE IT AND DO WHAT WITH IT I I DON'T OUR DATA IS IS -- SENT TO THEIR SERVERS -- BUT THE DATA IS NOT -- COMMINGLED ARE MIXED. SO THE LAW ENFORCEMENT DATA IT REMAINS LAW ENFORCEMENT DATA IT'S NOT AVAILABLE TO THE COMMERCIAL SIDE -- I SUPPOSE UNLESS THE LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY CHOOSES TO SHARE THAT WITH THE COMMERCIAL SIDE -- BUT THE COMMERCIAL DATA IS AVAILABLE TO LAW ENFORCEMENT SO IN THAT CASE THAT WAS MENTIONED EARLIER WITH THE FRESNO FASHION FAIR -- SECURITY I APOLOGIZE YOU DIDN'T. SOMEHOW REACH ME I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU CAN REACH ME I WOULD HAVE RESPONDED BUT BUT THOSE ARE CAN YOU RESPONSIBLY TO THAT AND WHILE YOU'RE HERE -- CERTAINLY SO YEAH APPARENTLY HAWTHORNE CHOSE TO SHARE THEIR DETECTIONS WITH THE FRESNO FASHION FAIR MALL SECURITY. THE FRESNO FASHION FAIR MALL SECURITY THEY HAVE A LICENSE PLATE READER CAMERAS I BELIEVE IN ONE OF THE VEHICLES. AND THEY USE -- VIGIL SOLUTIONS AND THAT INFORMATION GOES INTO THE VIGILANT SO -- SOLUTION SYSTEM -- BUT THAT BUT THAT. THAT WAS NOT AN ACT OF THE FRESNO POLICE DEPARTMENT NO WE HAVE NO THIS WAS NO. NO WE DON'T THING ELSE HAPPENING SOMEPLACE ELSE CORRECT WE DON'T SHARE DATA WITH FASHION FAIR GOT IT -- NINE JUST A FOLLOW UP VERY QUICKLY THERE ARE. ELEMENTS OF THE LAW WITH RESPECT TO HOW YOU. UP ANNOUNCE IT -- ALL OF THAT CAN. CAN YOU STEP US THROUGH. THE PROCESS THAT PRESENT NO. AND OTHER AGENCIES AYE AYE I SUPPOSE USED TO COMPLY WITH THE LAW AND HOW CLEAR IS THAT INFORMATION -- SO WITH REGARD TO THE PUBLIC HEARING REQUIREMENTS -- I KNOW PRIOR -- TO MOVING FORWARD WITH THIS WE DID HAVE -- SEVERAL DIFFERENT -- A COMMUNITY MEETINGS WITH COMMUNITY LEADERS% ETCETERA NOT SPECIFICALLY -- FOR LICENSE PLATE READER BUT MORE GENERALLY TO DISCUSS ALL OF THE TECHNOLOGIES THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE A USER WE WERE LOOKING AT USING IN OUR CRIME CENTER -- BUT LPR WAS DEFINITELY ONE OF THOSE -- BUT ULTIMATELY WE WENT -- TO CITY COUNCIL -- WITH THE REQUEST FOR THE HEARING A CITY COUNCIL. AND THAT WAS AN EIGHT EIGHT EIGHT PUBLICLY ANNOUNCED THE HEARING -- AGENDA AND FULLY IN. INFORMED PEOPLE YES A REGULAR COUNCIL SAYS INTEREST. THANK YOU. THANK YOU WILL JUST CENTER GONZALEZ PLACE. THANK YOU SO MUCH -- FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AS SENATOR WIENER AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY EACH OF YOU AT THE FROM THE AGENCIES PARTICULARLY LAPD BEING IN MY BACKYARD AS WELL. IT'S REALLY GREAT TO KNOW -- ALL OF THE GOOD WORK YOU'RE DOING A BEING FROM TECHNOLOGY IN MY PAST -- IT'S GOOD TO KNOW THE CG -- THE SUGGESTS THAT CERTIFICATION THE OVERLAY IN SOFTWARE WHICH IS YOUR HEAD IT SEEMS LIKE IN THE OF THE CURVE -- I HAVE IN THE PAST WORKED WITH OTHER AGENCIES THAT HAVE NOT BEEN SEE JUST CERTIFIED. WILL NOT SAY WHO BUT I THINK THIS PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY ON THE SECURITY SIDE TO BE ABLE TO ENSURE THAT THE DATA IS NOT ONLY -- BUT IT'S THAT IT'S JUST PROTECTED -- ENCRYPTED AND SECURE THAT IT'S NOT YOU KNOW WE DON'T HAVE ANY BREACHES ON THAT SIDE. I'M ALSO INTERESTED IN THE PUBLIC NOTIFICATIONS AND HEARINGS WHICH I THINK IS NOT A STANDARD ACROSS THE STATE TO BE GOOD TO KNOW ABOUT -- HOW THAT WILL? COME ABOUT AND THEN I THINK JUST IN GENERAL -- AS SENATE I'M SORRY ASSEMBLY MEMBER RUBIO AND MENTIONED -- I THINK THIS IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY -- TO LOOK AT VARIOUS AGENCIES NOT NECESSARILY -- AWAY TO POLITICIZE THIS BUT REALLY TO LOOK AT VARIOUS AGENCIES AND WHAT THE PROCEDURES AND PROCESSES ARE AND HOW THE PUBLIC WILL. IN TAKE THAT AS WELL SO THANK YOU AGAIN. THANK YOU IF I MAY PLEASE SO THANK YOU FOR COMMENTS AND I JUST WANNA BE CLEAR FROM THE LOS ANGELES PART SIDE SO WE ABSOLUTELY WELCOME OF THIS COMMITTEE DECIDES TO MOVE FORWARD WHERE WE'RE HAPPY TO PARTICIPATE IN WOULD. FULLY PARTICIPATE -- WE FEEL AGAIN THAT WE'RE AHEAD OF WHAT IS HAPPENING TODAY. AND THERE ARE I JUST WANT TO LEAVE YOU WITH THE SENSE THE LAW ENFORCEMENT RECOGNIZES THE IMPORTANCE AND THE SENSITIVITY OF THE NATURE OF THIS -- INFORMATION AS WELL WE SHARE THROUGH THE INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION CHIEF OF POLICE WE HAVE CONFERENCES AND WE HAVE BEST PRACTICES COMMITTEES THAT DISCUSS LICENSE PLATE RECOGNITION HOW WE SHARE IT DATA SECURITY RETENTION ALL THOSE DIFFERENT ITEMS. ALSO ADD THAT FROM THE LOS AS POLICE DEPARTMENT SIDE WE ARE CURRENTLY INVOLVED IN A PENDING LOGIC ONGOING LITIGATION WITH THE ACLU AND THE EFF ON LICENSE PLATE RECOGNITION WE HAVE GOT -- WITHOUT GOING INTO THE DETAILS BECAUSE I'M NOT ALLOWED TO BUT WE HAVE CERTAINLY IN PUBLIC FORM AND THROUGH THE COURTS HAVE SHARED ALL THE DATA THAT WERE REQUIRED TO SHARE WITH THEM. ABSENT THE DATA OF THE LICENSE PLATE READS THEMSELF WE HAVE BEEN VERY PROTECTIVE OF THE DATA AND STILL ARE AND THAT'S AN ONGOING LITIGATION TODAY BUT WE RECOGNIZE THAT THE THE SECURITY AND THE THE SHARING OF THE DATA IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PIECE AND WE'VE TAKEN A VERY VERY. STRONG LINE ON THAT THE CITY HAS AND WE CONTINUE TO SO. IN RESPECT TO THE AUDIT AND WHAT WOULD BE ALLOWED FROM AN INVESTIGATIVE STANDPOINT WE WOULD BE LIMITED IN TERMS OF WHAT WE COULD OF DEFAULT AS THE INVESTIGATIVE SIDE BECAUSE THAT'S THE ONLY REASON THAT WE USE THE OPR DATA THAT POINT JUST UP. I JUST WANTED TO ASK I'M NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO VOTE FOR THIS I'M GONNA LAY OFFOF IT. FOR SOME OF THE REASONS EXPRESSED EXPRESSED HER BUT I DID WANT TO SAY SOMETHING WITH RESPECT TO THE AUDITOR AND WITH RESPECT FRESNO. MY SENSE IS THIS GOING TO MOVE FORWARD -- AND I HAVE FULL AND COMPLETE CONFIDENCE IN THIS ORDER. TO GO ABOUT DIGGING INTO THIS INFORMATION AND GETTING IT -- PUT TOGETHER AND I ALSO KNOW -- FROM -- EIGHT YEARS OF BEING MAYOR FRESNO -- THE FRESNO POLICE DEPARTMENT IS DOING IT RIGHT I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE DEMONSTRATED THAT THEY ARE DOING IT RIGHT IN THE PROCESS. BUT I AM CONCERNED SIMILAR WITH WHAT US SENATOR BOARD JUST MIGHT HAVE RAISED HERE -- I I I AM A LITTLE SUSPICIOUS ABOUT WHY FRESNO AND WHY NOT SOMEPLACE ELSE. BE THAT AS IT MAY FULL CONFIDENCE IN THIS AUDITOR WHEN SHE GOES AFTER THE FACT SHE FINDS THEM. AND I AGREE WITH THE OTHER MEMBERS UP HERE WHO HAVE SUGGESTED. THAT WHEN YOU WHEN YOU GET THE UP. THE LANE HOW SEAL OF APPROVAL IS PRETTY GOOD. ONE THAT I REALLY OF ENCOURAGE ALL OF THE AFFECTED AGENCIES UP. WORK WITH HER -- THIS IS THIS WILL BE A STATE A SOLUTION IN THE MAKING I THINK. MY OTHER CONCERN THOUGH IS WHAT WE DO AFTER THE FACT WE GET THE AUDIT BACK IN THERE ARE SOME SUGGESTED. LEGISLATION -- MY HOPE IS THAT WE'RE NOT LOOKING TO FIND SOME KIND OF A REASON TO OUTLAW THE TECHNOLOGY -- CONSTRAINING RESTRAINING THE DISSEMINATION OF IT THOSE KINDS OF THINGS MAKES A LOT OF SENSE -- SO I I CAN'T SUPPORT IT FOR REASONS STATED HERE BUT I CAN'T SUPPORT THIS AUDITOR. PERSONALLY AND PROFESSIONALLY I WOULD ENCOURAGE EVERYBODY THOUGHT IT GOES FORWARD PLEASE COOPERATE YOU'LL FIND HER WONDERFUL TO WORK WITH. THANK YOU MISTER SUN WILL GO TO MOVE TO MISTER VOEPEL YES -- I HAVE A QUESTION TO THE STATE AUDITOR AND THEN ALSO SHORT COMMENT. QUESTION IS. YOU STATED EARLIER THAT RIGHT NOW YOU HAVE CAPACITY FOR SIX AUDITS WITH YOUR TEAM AND THEN DOWN THE ROAD NINE AUDITS. OF WILL. COME A LITTLE BIT LATER. TODAY I'M LOOKING AT EIGHT AUDITS ON OUR SCHEDULE HERE. THREE OF ALREADY BEEN PASSED. ON CONSENT CALENDARS SO THAT WOULD BE IN THREE MORE AUDITS ARE AVAILABLE THAT YOU CAN GO ON SO [inaudible] IF. WE'RE BEYOND YOUR CAPACITY TO AUDIT. DO YOU SIMPLY PUT IT DOWN ON YOUR QUEUE FOR A LATER AUDIT SO IT BECOMES A TIME MATTER. YES -- IF IF THE COMMITTEE DECIDES TO PROVE MORE THAN SIX AUDITS TODAY WHAT WE WOULD DO IS AS SOON AS ADDITIONAL TEAMS FREE UP -- WE WOULD ASSIGN STAFF TO PARTICULAR ARTISTS AND THE WAY WE GO ABOUT ASSIGNING PARTICULAR AUDITS IS WE'RE LOOKING AT THE COMPLEXITY OF THE WORK AND THE RESOURCES THAT ARE AVAILABLE SO I WOULD PUT. ON SOME OF THESE AUDITS MORE SEASONED FOLKS THAN -- LESS EXPERIENCED SO WE GO THROUGH THOSE ANALYSES -- WITH MY EXECUTIVE TEAM SO IF -- AGAIN MORE THAN SIX AUDITS ARE APPROVED TODAY WILL BE ABLE TO START. MY SIX AUDITS BETWEEN JULY AND AUGUST -- THE NEXT COUPLE OF MONTHS AND THEN SUBSEQUENT TO THAT WE HAVE SOME WORK GOING OUT IN SEPTEMBER OCTOBER NOVEMBER SO WE'LL BE ABLE TO COMMENCE ANY ADDITIONAL LOT IT'S THEIR PROOF TODAY. IN THOSE MONTHS. THANK YOU AND THEN WITH THAT IN MIND -- I'M. I HAVE. GREAT RESPECT FOR THE AUTHOR. BUT I'M NOT QUITE SURE IN MY MIND HOW BADLY THIS AUDIT IS NEEDED. AND HERE'S MY LOGIC ON THAT. IF I WANT TO LOOK AT MY HOUSE OR MY NEIGHBORHOOD I GOT GOOGLE EARTH WE HAVE ZILLOW WE HAVE AMAZON ANOTHER THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY DEGREE RECORDINGS. WE HAVE CAMERAS EVERYWHERE FOR ONE LOOK IN MY BACKYARD IT'S HERE ON MY PHONE -- SOAP CELL PHONE GPS. THEY CAN SUBPOENA WHERE YOU BEN. WHERE YOU'RE GO ON? FOREVER ALL RIGHT EVEN MY WIFE KNOWS WHERE I'M AT SO. WITH GREAT RESPECT. I WOULD IF THIS BODY APPROVES THIS I WOULD PUT IT. IN A HOUSE RESPECTFULLY THAT IT GO DOWN ON YOUR PRIORITY LIST -- BECAUSE I I PERSONALLY JUST DON'T SEE ANY GREAT NEED FOR THIS [inaudible] SPECIFIC SAMPLING. RIGHT THANK YOU WITH THAT LET ME ASK THERE'S ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS FROM THE DÃ­AS. HEARING IN SAYING THAT -- MAY JUST ASK MADAM AUDITOR AT MISS HOW. YOU KNOW EARLIER I THINK IT WAS THE STATUS IT STATED THAT THEY TERMINATED -- USING THIS THIS THIS -- TECHNOLOGY BACK IN NOVEMBER OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN IF I HEARD THAT CORRECTLY. AND IF THAT ISTHE CASE IN FACT THIS WOULD NARROW -- THE SCOPE OF THE OUT IT WOULD BE MY WAS IT WOULD BE WHAT I WOULD GAS WOULD. DO YOU. CONCUR THAT'S CORRECT I MEAN IF IF IN FACT WE WOULD WANT TO CONFIRM THAT THEY HAVE NO LONGER THERE THE DEPARTMENT HUMAN. ASSISTANCE IN SACRAMENTO IS NO LONGER USING THAT TECHNOLOGY IF THERE'S SENATOR WIENER IS COMFORTABLE WITH THAT WHERE WE WE DON'T LOOK BACK AND SEE WHAT THEY HAD DONE IN THE PAST BECAUSE WE CONFIRM OR VERIFY THAT THEY'RE NO LONGER USING -- THE TECHNOLOGY THEN THAT WOULD REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF HOURS AND NECESSARY TO COMPLETE THE JOB OBVIOUSLY BECAUSE WE'RE WE'RE NOT LOOKING AT THAT PARTICULAR ENTITY -- ROUGHLY THAT WOULD SAVE -- PROBABLY A HUNDRED AND TWENTY HOURS -- AS AS FAR AS THE THE BUDGET ITSELF BECAUSE THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE HOURS WERE GOING TO EXPAND. OUR ON OBJECTIVE THREE WHICH IS DRILLING DOWN AT EACH OF THOSE ENTITIES OF COURSE I SPOKE ABOUT - THE OBJECTIVE RELATED TO THE SURVEY SURVEYING -- LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT THROUGHOUT THE STATE BUT IT WOULD ABSOLUTELY REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF TIME AND CERTAINLY THE COST OF THE AUDIT. HAVE I MIGHT JUST. ADD ON THAT SO SACRAMENTO COUNTY VARIOUS AGENCIES -- USE OR HAVE USED -- TO INCLUDING -- THE HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY WHICH JUST TERMINATED THEIR CONTRACT I BELIEVE LAST MONTH -- AND THERE HAVE BEEN SOME ISSUES IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY -- SOME BOAT BELIEVER. POTENTIAL VIOLATIONS OF SB THIRTY FOUR OZ ROBERT HAVE A CONVERSATION WE CERTAINLY DON'T WANT ON THE LISTS AUDITING BUT IF THERE WAS A TERMINATE A CONTRACT WHERE THERE WAS. AN ACTUAL VIOLATION THAT WAS HAPPENING THAT MAY HAVE POTENTIAL EVEN LED TO THE TERMINATION -- THAT'S USEFUL INFORMATION AS WELL SOBRE WHAT RAPID TO HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH THE AUDITOR OKAY UNDERSTOOD -- WITH THAT LET'S GO TO MOVE TO PUBLIC COMMENT FROM ASK THERE'S ANY PUBLIC COMMENT ON THIS ITEM. AND IF YOU COULD PLEASE BE CONCISE WITH YOUR COMMENTS AND OKAY [inaudible] ALL RIGHT. HEARING AND SEEING NO PUBLIC COMMENT AT THIS TIME. LET ME ASK IF US SENATOR YOU'D LIKE TO CLOSE ON THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND I WANT TO THANK CALLERS FOR VERY THOUGHTFUL -- CONVERSATION I TO BE CLEAR MY MY GOAL IS NOT TO BAN THIS TECHNOLOGY THIS TECHNOLOGY CAN BE VERY VERY USEFUL IN A VARIETY OF CONTACTS. ON BUT WHAT I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE KNOWLEDGE THAT WE WANTED TO BE USED THE WAY IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE USED -- AND NOT -- ABUSE WHETHER INTENTIONALLY OR UNINTENTIONALLY THIS IS NOT ABOUT THE SERVE OUT PEOPLE DOING THINGS MALICIOUSLY BUT WE ALL KNOW AND GOVERNMENT -- AND IT I AM IN THE CORPORATE SECTOR THINGS CAN BE DONE JUST AN ADVERT AND LIKE WE DON'T REALIZE WHAT'S HAPPENING. AND THE PURPOSE OF THIS AUDIT AS NOT TO POINT TO POINT FINGERS -- THE IT IS TO JUST MAKE SURE THAT THE LAW IS BEING FOLLOWED THAT THE PROCEDURES ARE CORRECT AND IF THERE ARE ISSUES THAT WE CAN HELP. LOCAL JURISDICTIONS COMPLY OR IF WE NEED TO IMPROVE THE LAW THAT WE CAN DO THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. SENATOR -- WITH THAT -- I DO HAVE A DO PASS RECOMMENDATION ON THIS -- DO BELIEVE YOU'RE TRYING TO PROTECT OUR PRIVACY AND CIVIL LIBERTIES AND SEE WHICH ENTITIES ARE COMPLYING WITH SENATE BILL THIRTY FOUR WHICH WAS SIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR.

CAMPUS BASED STUDENT FEES -- MISS FOR BATH WHEN YOU'RE READY FOR PRESENT ON AGENDA ITEM NUMBER FOUR PLACE YES GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST THE COMMITTEE'S APPROVAL OF AN AUDIT OF THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA. ADMISSIONS POLICIES AND PRACTICES INCLUDING EFFORTS TO DETECT AND ADDRESS FRAUD IN THE MISSIONS PROCESS. NEWS ARTICLES OVER THE LAST FEW MONTHS HAVE REPORTED ON A NATION WIDE STREET SCANDAL IN WHICH HUNDREDS OF INDIVIDUALS COMMITTED FRAUD. TO GAIN EMISSIONS TO SOME OF THE NATION'S TOP ACADEMIC INSTITUTIONS LET'S BE CLEAR WE'RE VERY LUCKY IN CALIFORNIA THE SOME OF THE NATION'S TOP INSTITUTIONS ARE PUBLIC HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS AND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. TO UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA CAMPUSES HAVE BEEN CONNECTED WITH EMISSIONS CHEATING SCANDAL UCLA MEN'S SOCCER COACH WAS M. -- INDICTED AS PART OF OUR IT IS INDICATED AS PART OF THE F. B. I.'S WIDESPREAD CORRUPTION INVESTIGATION. AND CHARGED WITH ALLEGEDLY ACCEPTING TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS IN BRIBES FOR FACILITATING THE ENROLLMENT. OF STUDENTS A SOCCER PLAYERS EVEN THOUGH THEY DID NOT COMPETITIVELY PLAY THE SPORT. AT UC BERKELEY A PARENT IS ALLEGED TO HAVE PAID SOME ONE TO TAKE THE SAT TEST IN PLACE OF A SON WHO IS A MINUTE TO BERKELEY. I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE SWIFT AND DECISIVE ACTION OF PRESENT APOLOGY NO AND THE WORK OF THE UC ON CONDUCTING ITS OWN INTERNAL INVESTIGATION INTO THESE CRIMES. I AGREE WITH PRESIDENT OF ALL TIME WHEN SHE SAID ILLEGAL INAPPROPRIATE AND UNETHICAL MEANS TO GAIN ADMISSION AT THE EXPENSE OF DESERVING APPLICANTS. IS ANTI IT SET A GOAL TO EVERY ASPECT OF OUR MISSION AND VALUES. AS A PUBLIC INSTITUTION ONE OF THE MOST HIGHLY REGARDED IN THE WORLD I CALLED THE NUMBER ONE PUBLIC UNIVERSITY IN THE WORLD -- I WENT TO UC BERKELEY GO BEARS -- WE ARE DEDICATED TO ENSURING LEVEL PLAYING FIELD FOR EVERY APPLICANT -- I'M SAT IN AS AS A UC BERKELEY GRAD OF THE RECENT SCANDAL BUT I'M OPTIMISTIC THAT AN A STATE AUDIT PERFORMED BY OUR INDEPENDENT AUDITOR. CAN. A HELP ASSURE CAL IF CALIFORNIANS THAT THE UC IS DOING ALL THAT IT CAN DO TO ENSURE THAT MERITOCRACY IN DIVERSITY THAT WE VALUE IS RETAIN WITHIN OUR HIGHER EDUCATION PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS CALIFORNIA. TO THIS END I REQUEST OF THE STATE AUDITOR CONDUCT AN AUDIT WITH THE FOLLOWING SCOPE. REVIEW AND ASSESS UC SYSTEM WHY POLICIES AND PRACTICES REGARDING EMISSIONS. REVIEW AND ASSESS THE UC ADMISSIONS POLICIES AND PROCESSES FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY. UCLAA UCSD. PROVIDING THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION REGARDING UC AUDIBLE STUDENTS ADMITTED TO THE THREE CAMPUSES UNDER THE UC SPECIAL MISSIONS POLICY OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS WITH A FOCUS ON STUDENTS ADMITTED TO THE IDENTIFICATION OF A SPECIAL TALENT OR TREATMENT. INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ATHLETIC ARTISTIC TALENT. AT WHAT SHE MEANT. REVIEW AND ASSESS UC AND UC CAMPUS POLICIES AND PRACTICES REGARDING RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THEM THE COLLEGE BOARD AC T. AND PRIVATE EMISSIONS CONSULTANTS. WARM WORK RELATED TO AN AUDIT REPORT REQUESTED BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER GIPSON TITLED THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA IT'S EMISSIONS AND FINANCIAL DECISIONS HAVE. DECIDED. DESERVE AND CALIFORNIA RESIDENT STUDENTS. REPORT FROM. TWENTY FIFTEEN TO TWENTY SEVENTEEN INCLUDE A THOROUGH REVIEW OF THE UC'S EFFORT TO IMPLEMENT THE STATE AUDITOR'S RECOMMENDATIONS RELATED TO THE MISSION OF NON RESIDENT APPLICANTS. AS WELL AS ANALYSIS OF THE TRENDS RELATED TO THE MISSION OF NONRESIDENT AND RESIDENT STUDENTS SINCE TWENTY TWO AND TWENTY ELEVEN BECAUSE THE UC IS CURRENTLY CONDUCTING ITS OWN REVIEW. I WANT TO BE SENSITIVE TO ALSO THE CAPACITY WITHIN THE AUDITOR'S OFFICE. AS THE STATE AUDITOR BEGAN HER AUDIT AFTER THE UC FINISHES ITS REVIEW OR SIX MONTHS FROM THE DATE OF THE COMMITTEE APPROVES THIS AUDIT REQUEST WHICHEVER OCCURS FIRST. AGAIN WHY KNOWLEDGE THE WORK OF THE UC ON CONDUCTING ITS OWN INTERNAL INVESTIGATION INTO THESE CRIMES. THE AUDIT CONDUCTED BY THE UC IS BEING CONDUCTED BY CAMPUS AUDITOR'S AND THE UC PRESIDENT REGION'S AUDITOR'S IT'S AN INTERNAL AUDIT IT IS NOT AN OBJECTIVE STATE ON IT. I BELIEVE THE MOST. EFFECTIVE INCREDIBLE WAY TO RESTORE OUR PUBLIC FAITH IN OUR HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS AS A WITH A WITH A FAIR AN INDEPENDENT STATE ON IT. I ENCOURAGE THE UC'S TO CONTINUE WORKING SYSTEM WIDE TO ADDRESS THEIR ISSUES AND WORK WITH THE STATE AUDITOR. IN HER INVESTIGATION THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND ATTENTION TO THIS REQUEST THIS MORNING MEMBERS AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT OF THIS AUDIT REQUEST. THANK YOU MISS BURNER **** BATH SIGNAL WITNESSES AT THE TABLE WILL MOVE TO THE STATE AUDITOR. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AS ASSEMBLYMEMBER BURNER HARDCORE VAST INDICATED. SOME OF THE OBJECTIVES ARE RELATED TO SYSTEM WIDE POLICIES ARE WITH RESPECT TO ADMISSION POLICIES AND PRACTICES BUT REALLY. SHE'S ASKING US TO DRILL DOWN AT THOSE THREE INDIVIDUAL CAMPUSES BERKELEY UCLA AND UC SAN DIEGO AND LOOKING AT A VARIETY OF ISSUES. LOOKING DETERMINE WHETHER THERE ARE PARTICULAR FACTORS -- THAT ARE CONSIDERED WHEN DECIDING TO ADMIT -- APPLICANTS TO THE RESPECTIVE CAMPUSES IDENTIFYING ANY RISKS ASSOCIATED LOOKING AT THE PROCESS ITSELF ARE THERE RISKS. IN THAT PROCESS OUR WEAKNESSES IN THAT PARTICULAR PROCESS IN ADDITION SHE IS ASKING US TO LOOK AT THE EXTENT TO WHICH DONATIONS A LEGACY ADMISSIONS ARE OR ANY OTHER TYPE OF INFLUENCE IS FACTORING IN SOME OF THOSE ADMISSION DECISIONS -- AGAIN AS SHE INDICATED SHE IS ASKING US TO LOOK AT A THREE YEAR WINDOW REALLY AGAIN DRILLING DOWN AND DETERMINING HOW MANY STUDENTS AT THOSE THREE RESPECTIVE CAMPUSES WERE ADMITTED UNDER A SPECIAL ADMISSIONS POLICY -- WHO WAS INVOLVED IN THAT DECISON MAKING AND DID THEY FOLLOW THE THAT THE POLICIES AND PROTOCOLS OF THEIR RESPECTIVE CAMPUS -- ALSO WHEN WE IDENTIFY THOSE STUDENTS -- WHAT CATEGORIES ARE THE AND ARE BY THE PRIMARILY ATHLETES ARE THERE SOME THAT WERE ADMITTED BECAUSE THEY HAVE A SPECIAL GIFT WITH RESPECT TO THE ARTS? THAT SORT OF THING ALSO ASKING US TO DETERMINE WHAT KIND OF FOLLOW UP ARE THE UNIVERSITY CAMPUS IS DOING TO ENSURE THAT THOSE STUDENTS CONTINUE TO PARTICIPATE IN A PARTICULAR ATHLETIC. ON THE ATHLETIC TEAMS -- ARE THEY CONTINUING TO PARTICIPATE AND THEN THE ACTIVITY THAT FOR WHICH THEY WERE GIVEN SPECIAL ADMISSION. AND THEN WITH RESPECT -- TO ONE MORE THING RELATED TO ADMISSIONS IS AS AS SHE INDICATED ANY INTERACTIONS BETWEEN NOW THE SYSTEM AND OR THOSE CAMPUSES WITH A C. T. COLLEGE BOARD AND PRIVATE CONSULTANTS. WITH RESPECT TO THE PREVIOUS AUDIT WE HAD ISSUED -- BACK IN MARCH OF TWENTY SIXTEEN THAT WAS RELATED TO NON RESIDENT -- ADMISSIONS AND RESIDENT AND THAT MORE NON RESIDENT STUDENTS HAD BEEN ADMITTED TO CALIFORNIA OUR UNIVERSITIES SHE'S ASKING US TO LOOK AT THE EFFICIENCY AND ESSENTIALLY WHATIS YOU SEE DONE TO REACT TO THE RECOMMENDATIONS -- THAT WERE MADE IN THAT REPORT BUT SHE'S ALSO ASKING US TO LOOK AT TRENDS OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS TO DETERMINE WHETHER IT'S THERE HAS BEEN ANY CHANGE. AS TO THE NUMBER OF RESIDENTS STUDENTS ADMITTED TO UC SCHOOLS ARE COMPARED TO NON RESIDENT STUDENTS ON THE BUDGET FOR THIS SITE IT'S ABOUT THIRTY FOUR HUNDRED HOURS. AGAIN THAT'S BECAUSE WE'RE GONNA DO SOME WORK SYSTEM WIDE I KNOW THERE HAS BEEN A RECENT REPORT ISSUED BY THE UC AUDITOR I KNOW HE'S IN THE AUDIENCE I'M NOT GOING. TO SPEAK TO IT TO THE SPECIFICS OF HIS PARTICULAR REPORT I DID REVIEW IT IT'S BASICALLY JUST LOOKING TO SEE ABOUT THE EXISTENCE OF POLICIES IT'S KIND OF A CONTROL REVIEW. LOOKING AT WHAT POLICIES TO EACH OF THE CAMPUSES HAVE ARE THEIR WEAKNESSES IN THOSE POLICY SO TO THE EXTENT WE CAN RELY ON THAT WORK IN THE EVENT DECIDED IS APPROVED. THAT WOULD REDUCE SOME OF THE AMOUNT OF TIME WE WOULD HAVE TO SPEND DOING THAT BUT I THINK THE LION'S SHARE OF WHAT. MS BOERNER HORVATH ASKING US TO DO IS GET OUT TO THOSE THREE CAMPUSES AND REALLY DRILL DOWN AND UNDERSTAND WHAT'S OCCURRING AT THOSE THOSE PARTICULAR INSTITUTIONS -- AND AGAIN THAT'S WHY THE HOURS ARE ARE. SUCH THAT THEY ARE BECAUSE WE WOULD WE WOULD NEED TO BE ON EACH OF THOSE RESPECTIVE CAMPUSES AND REALLY LOOKING AT HOW MANY STUDENTS WERE ADMITTED -- WHAT WAS THE DECISION MAKING DID THEY FOLLOW PROTOCOLS AND ARE THEY FOLLOWING UP? WITH RESPECT TO THOSE INDIVIDUAL STUDENTS WITH THAT MISTER CHAIR I WILL ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS MEMBERS MAY HAVE THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND THANK YOU MISS BOERNER HORVATH -- FOR YOUR COMMENTS ABOUT THE VALUE OF AN EXTERNAL -- AUDIT AS WELL WITH THAT LET'S GO TO MOVE TO THE AFFECTED AGENCIES I INVITE AT THIS TIME -- REPRESENTATIVES OF ANY OF THE AFFECTED AGENCIES WHICH WOULD BE THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA IN THIS CASE -- TO THE TABLE FOR TESTIMONY. IF YOU COULD PLEASE BE CONCISE WITH YOUR COMMENTS WOULD APPRECIATE THAT THANK YOU.

HOW LONG HAS THE THE INTERNAL AUDIT SHOP CALLING OF YOU GUYS BEEN IN EXISTENCE? TEN YEARS ABOUT TEN YEARS THIS ARE OKAY WITH THAT WE'RE GOING TO MOVE TO QUESTIONS FROM THE DÃ­AS -- SENATOR ROTH PLEASE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR USE THE WORD -- CANDOR AND I HAVE TO SAY I DID REVIEW YOUR FIRST REPORT -- AND I AM IMPRESSED WITH THE CANDOR WITH WHICH YOU AND YOUR OPERATION ADDENDA FIDE WEAKNESSES -- IN THE UC SYSTEM AN ADVERSE INDIVIDUAL CAMPUSES THAT'S SOMETIMES UNUSUAL IN STATE GOVERNMENT AND I COMMEND YOU FOR DOING SO -- I I DID NOTICE THAT IN IN YOUR REPORT CAMPUSES IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES APPEAR TO HAVE LOCAL OPTIONS WITH RESPECT TO ADMISSIONS PRACTICES AND PROCESSES THAT ARE IN PLACE. AND I'M I'M WONDERING. WHY WE DON'T STANDARDIZE SOME OF THOSE PROCESSES BUT I GUESS I LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR SECOND REPORT? A TO SEE HOW YOU DEAL WITH THAT -- IT WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT CONTROLS. I ASSUME THAT -- WHEN YOU ISSUE THESE TWO REPORTS THAT THERE'S BACKUP DATA THAT'S ATTACHED TO THEM AS WOULD BE TRUE IN A STANDARD AUDIT SITUATION? THAT'S CORRECT. SO WHEN YOU COMPLETE THE NOT ONLY THIS YOU'VE COMPLETED THIS FIRST REPORT WHEN YOU COMPLETE YOUR SECOND REPORT. A WILL WILL YOU BE IN A POSITION TO PROVIDE BOTH REPORTS AND THE BACKUP DATA SUPPORTING YOUR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS TO OUR STATE AUDITOR. WE WOULD YES OKAY. SO. I COMMEND THE AUTHOR -- IN TERMS OF RAW -- RESPECTING THE PROCESS AND AND ALLOWING THE INTERNAL AUDIT TO PROCEED -- TO GO TO ITS COMPLETION -- SO WE DON'T DUPLICATE EFFORT AT UNLESS IT'S NECESSARY TO DO SO. AND THANK YOU MADAM STATE WATER AUDITOR FOR YOUR COMMENTS I WOULD ASK THAT -- WHEN YOU RECEIVE A BOTH AUDIT REPORTS THAT YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THEM YOUR STAFF IN THE BACK OF DATA? TO MAKE SURE THAT THE IF THIS AUDIT IS APPROVED AND PROCEEDS. FORWARD THAT WE DON'T DUPLICATE EFFORT WHEN IT'S NOT NECESSARY TO DO SO HOWEVER THIS IS A VERY -- HIGH VOLTAGE ISSUE -- THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED AND AND RESOLVED AND SO I THANK YOU FOR AGREEING TO TAKE ON OF THE TASK. I THINK THAT IS ALL THAT I WANTED -- TO TO SAY ON THIS POINT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR RIGHT. THANK YOU ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS FROM THE DIET SENATOR MINING PLACE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND I ALSO WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR THE WILLINGNESS. TO KINDA STAGER SEQUENCE -- INITIATION OF A STATE ON IT I GUESS PURSUING THEIR LITTLE LITTLE BIT MORE. IT'S HARD TO KNOW WE WE WE DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO BE RETURNED IN THIS SECOND INTERNAL AUDIT -- IN WELL -- SENATOR ROTH SUGGESTED. ADAPTING A STATE AUDIT BASED ON GAPS OR AREAS FOR FURTHER INQUIRY -- I'M JUST WONDERING IF IF WE WILL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY. IN IN THE OPERATION OF OF OF THIS LEGISLATIVE AUDIT COMMITTEE. TO ALSO HAVE ACCESS TO THAT SECOND ON IT. AND HAVE A TOUCH POINT POTENTIALLY THE FUTURE MEETING IN THE FALLWHERE THERE'S SOME CONSENSUS. PRIORITIZATION WOULD THAT BE MAYBE I'LL DIRECT THIS QUESTION TO THE AUDITOR HAVE YOU FACED A CIRCUMSTANCE LIKE THIS. IN THE PAST. THE CLOSEST CIRCUMSTANCE TO SOMETHING LIKE THIS IN THE PAST IS IS WAITING OR DELAYING COMMENCING AN AUDIT BECAUSE THERE'S THERE'S EITHER ON ON THERE'S LITIGATION OR THERE'S ON GOING ON AT WORK AND AND TO ANSWER SENATOR ROSS QUESTION OR COMMENT. WE ARE REQUIRED BY STANDARDS TO CONSIDER ANY WORK THAT'S ALREADY BEEN DONE WHAT WE WOULD LOOK AT IN THOSE WORK PAPERS IS HOW THEY WENT ABOUT CONDUCTING THEIR WORK -- HAVE GREAT RESPECT FOR MISTER BUSTAMANTE I DON'T KNOW A LOT ABOUT THE INTERNAL AUDIT FUNCTIONS AT THE VARIOUS CAMPUSES -- I KNOW WHAT MY STAFF CAN DO -- BUT AS FAR AS YOUR QUESTION SENATOR THE THE ONLY REALLY PRECEDENT FOR SOMETHING LIKE THIS IS DELAYING THE COMMENCEMENT OF A PARTICULAR AUDIT I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE SCOPE OF THIS SECOND REVIEW THAT. THE UC AUDITOR AND AND THE INTERNAL AUDITORS INTEND TO DO -- AS AS IS BOERNER HORVATH SAID SHE SPECIFICALLY ASKING US TO DRILL DOWN AT THREE PARTICULAR CAMPUSES -- I DON'T KNOW AGAIN I I CAN'T SPEAK TO BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE SCOPE OF THE ON IT'S GONNA BE IS AS FAR AS WHAT THE UC IS INTENDING TO DO -- BUT AS FAR AS PRESIDENT IT'S REALLY BEEN MORE OF A DELAY -- IN DETERMINING. IF THE COMMITTEE WOULD APPROVE A REQUEST AND THEN ASK US TO DELAY COMMENCING THE AUDIT. IT IS PART OF THAT DELAY YOU WOULD A DAT TO THE INFORMATION IT'S AT YOUR DISPOSAL. ABSOLUTELY AT AND AGAIN AT UC HAS ASSERTED THEY WILL SHARE THE INFORMATION WITH US I MEAN WE WOULD HAVE ACCESS TO THE INFORMATION SO I WOULD MAKE SURE WE GET IT -- BUT I KNOW HE WOULD FULLY COOPERATE SO WE WOULD LOOK AT AS I DID I MEAN I REVIEWED THE FIRST REPORT BECAUSE I WANTED TO BE PREPARED FOR TODAY'S HEARING TO DETERMINE. WHAT WAS THE SCOPE AND AS HE INDICATED IT WAS REALLY LOOKING AT WHAT POLICIES EXIST OUT THERE WHAT CONTROLS AND ARE THEIR WEAKNESSES AND SOME OF THOSE POLICIES BECAUSE THERE IS DISCRETION AT VARIOUS CAMPUSES -- THERE IS SOME -- BORDER REGION POLICY OUT THERE AS FAR AS THAT THE PERCENTAGE OF INDIVIDUALS CAN THAT CAN BE ADMITTED UNDER THIS PARTICULAR -- SPECIAL ADMISSION BY EXCEPTION AND HE INDICATES IN HIS REPORT THAT THERE WAS AT LEAST ONE CAMPUS THAT EXCEEDED THAT THAT DIDN'T COMPLY WITH THAT POLICY SO I WOULD REALLY BE INTERESTED IN UNDERSTANDING THE SCOPE OF THE NEXT REVIEW WE WOULD ABSOLUTELY LOOK AT THIS ONE WANT TO LOOK AT THE WORK. PAPERS IN DETAIL ON THIS ONE AS SOON AS THEY ISSUE THE NEXT REPORT ON MY STAFF WOULD CALL THROUGH THAT REPORT LOOK AT THE WORK PAPERS AND DETERMINE IF WE CAN RELY ON THE WORK WE WILL BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT TO DUPLICATE. IF WE CAN'T THEN WE'RE GONNA GO OUT AND DO THE WORK OURSELVES THANK YOU AND FOR THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER. YOU'VE SELECTED THESE THREE CAMPUSES FROM. I GUESS. FIRST QUESTION WHY THOSE THREE CAMPUSES FOLLOW UP. BASED ON THE ORDER REPORT INTERNAL HONORED REPORT NOT YET RECEIVED -- WOULD THERE BE ANY PROSPECT OF CHANGING THE FOCUS OF THE CAMPUSES BASED ON WHAT YOU MIGHT LEARN. ON THE INTERNAL ON IT SO THE THREE CAMPUSES WERE CHOSEN BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY UC BERKELEY CA LAYING UCSD -- BOTH HAVE HIGH LEVELS OF EMISSIONS UNDER -- THE SPECIAL. SPECIAL ADMISSIONS NATIONAL EMISSIONS PROCESS THAT'S WHY THEY WERE CHOSEN FOR THAT. THANK YOU MOM THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR NO FURTHER QUESTIONS THANK YOU WITH THAT WILL GO TO MOVE BACK TO SENATOR OFFICE AMANDA MARTYR WHAT IWOULD ASK IS AFTER YOU COMPLETE YOUR REVIEW OF THE INTERNAL AUDIT REPORTS IN THE BACK OF DATA. WOULD YOU NOTIFY THE CHAIR AND THE VICE CHAIR -- TO THE EXTENT THAT YOUR AUDIT NEEDS TO BE MODIFIED THE THE SCOPE OF THE OTHER NEEDS TO BE CHANGED -- THERE HASN'T BEEN PRESIDENT FOR THAT IN THE PAST THAT THE CONCERN THAT I WOULD HAVE -- IS WELL THAT WOULD BE YOUR CALL. RIGHT I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE IF IF WE DECIDE WE NEED TO COMMENCE AN AUDIT ONCE AN AUDIT IS COMMENCED WHAT WE'RE DOING IS CONFIDENTIAL BUT CERTAINLY -- HI BY THIS IS THAT THERE IS YOU ALWAYS ASK DIFFICULT WELL TO THE CENTER. FOR WHAT IS NOT CONFIDENTIAL. ARE THE ISSUES THAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT AND SO MY QUESTION IS IF THOSE ISSUES NEED TO BE MODIFIED. FOR EXAMPLE THERE SIX AND YOU YOU CAN DELETE NUMBER SIX AND WORK ON FIVE THAT'S WHAT I WOULD BE ASKING NOT. TO KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING IN YOUR AUDIT OR WHAT YOU FOUND AS A PRELIMINARY MATTER. MY ONLY INTEREST IS IN AVOIDING DUPLICATION SO IF YOU REVIEW BOTH REPORTS IN THE BACK OF DATA. AND THE ASSEMBLY MEMBERS AS FOR FIVE POINTS AND YOU ONLY NEED TO LOOK AT FOR BECAUSE THE FIFTH ONE IS COVERED. THAT'S WHAT I WOULD ASK THAT YOU NOTIFY THE CHAIR AND THE VICE CHAIR BUT DOES THAT WORK YES CENTER ABSOLUTELY CAN DO THAT. THANK YOU MISTER THANK YOU WE ASK THERE'S ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS FROM THE DÃ­AS. HEARING AND SEEING -- NINE LÃ  BE GOOD TO MOVE TO PUBLIC COMMENTS.

WELL HOLD THAT WELL THE ROLE OPEN ON THAT ITEM -- MISS BOERNER HORVATH IF YOU'D LIKE TO MOVE ON TO AGENDA ITEM NUMBER. FIVE TWENTY NINETEEN DASH ONE ONE FOUR CSU STUDENT FEES. YES UGH GOOD MORNING CHAIR I MEMBERS I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE AUDIT COMMITTEE APPROVE A STATE AUDIT TO EXAMINE. THE INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF AND THE AMOUNT OF CAMPUS BASED STUDENT FEES FOR SELECT CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY CAMPUSES. WE ALL KNOW THAT COLLEGE AFFORDABILITY IS A SIGNIFICANT CONCERN FOR STUDENTS AND FAMILIES IN CALIFORNIA. FOR THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN TWENTY NINETEEN ACADEMIC YEAR TUITION FOR FULL A FULL TIME UNDERGRADUATE CSU STUDENT IS 500-070-0402 DOLLARS. HOWEVER IN ADDITION TO THE COST OF CSU TUITION THERE'S BEEN AN INCREASE IN THE LAST THREE YEARS OF CAMPUS BASED FEES. INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO STUDENT SUCCESS FEES MATERIALS SERVICES. YEAH MATERIALS SERVICES THE FACILITY FEES AND STUDENT CENTER FEES. THESE ADDITIONAL FEES COULD ADD THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS TO THE TOTAL COST OF ATTENDANCE. AT CAL POLY SAN LUIS OBISPO FOR EXAMPLE THESE ADDITIONAL FEES REYES STUDENTS COST OF A TO BUY ADDITIONAL FOUR THOUSAND SEVENTY FOUR DOLLARS PER YEAR OVER THE BASE TUITION. TO A TOTAL OF NINE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SEVENTY SIX DOLLARS. AND THESE ARE THE NUMBERS THAT DO NOT EVEN INCLUDE HOUSING BOOKS OR ANY OTHER COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH ATTENDING COLLEGE. THIS IS ALSO ENVIRONMENT WERE RECENT RESEARCH INDICATES THE FOOD INSECURITY AND TEN POINT 9% OF STUDENTS REPORTED EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS. AT ONE OR MORE TIMES IN THE LAST TWELVE MONTHS. EVERY PENNY COUNTS FOR MANY OF OUR STUDENTS AND SO IT'S CRITICAL THAT THE CSU PROVIDE ADDITIONAL TRANSPARENCY. ON CAMPUS BASED FEES STUDENT FEES. TO THIS END I AM A QUESTION THE STATE WATER FOCUS ON FOUR CAMPUSES DISTRIBUTED THROUGHOUT THE STATE INCLUDING CSU CHICO CSU SAN LUIS OBISPO CSU SAN DIEGO. AND SEE IF YOU SAN JOSE STATE. AND CSU SAN JOSE. IN PREPARING FOR THIS REQUEST IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT THERE ARE SIX CATEGORIES OF COMMON CAMPUS BASED FEES OFTEN POSED ON STUDENTS. THESE FEES CATEGORIES INCLUDE HEALTH FACILITIES HEALTH SERVICES. INSTRUCTION UP A CONSTRUCTION LEE RELATED ACTIVITIES MATERIAL SERVICES AND FACILITIES STUDENT SUCCESS AND STUDENT CENTER. THE AUDIT SHOULD PROVIDE INFORMATION ON HOW OFTEN AND BY HOW MUCH FEES WERE INCREASED OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS. IN EACH OF THE SIX AVAILABLE CATEGORIES IN EACH OF THE CAL CAMPUS THE SELECTED FOR THE AUDIT. AND ANSWER SOME BASIC QUESTIONS INCLUDING WHAT IS THE PROCESS FOR ORIGINATING APPROVING AND IMPLEMENTING A STUDENT FEE. DO ANY OF THESE CAMPUSES REQUIRE A STUDENT VOTE TO ADOPT THESE FEES. HOW MUCH DO STUDENT FEES ADD TO THE TOTAL COST OF ATTENDANCE? AT THESE SPECIFIC CAMPUSES. ARE ANY OPTIONAL ARE THEY COVERED BY FINANCIAL AID. ARE THE FUNDS GET COLLECTED KEPT IN A SEPARATE MISSION SPECIFIC ACCOUNTS OR ARE THEY COMMINGLED. WHAT SAFEGUARDS ARE IN PLACE TO ENSURE FUNDS ARE EXPENDED ON WHAT THEY WERE INTENDED? FOR THIS CSU HAVE A SYSTEM WHY PAUL SYSTEM MY POLICIES IN PLACE GOVERNING THE ADOPTION OF THE STUDENT FEES. THIS REQUEST COMES AT A TIME WHEN RECENTLY COMPLETED STATE AUDIT BY THE STATE AUDITOR WE FEEL THAT SEAT REVEALED THAT CSU HAD ACCRUED A PREVIOUSLY UNREVEALED SURPLUS OF OVER ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS. WELL STUDENT TUITION OVER THE SAME PERIOD CONTINUE TO INCREASE. THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY IS THE LARGEST SYSTEM OF HIGHER EDUCATION IN THE COUNTRY WITH TWENTY THREE CAMPUSES FIFTY THOUSAND FACULTY AND STAFF. OF FOUR HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FOUR THOUSAND STUDENTS. WE OWE IT TO THE STUDENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES TO ENSURE THAT WE DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO MINIMIZE ACOSTA SODI ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER EDUCATION. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND ATTENTION TO THIS REQUEST THIS MORNING MEMBERS AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT ON THIS ON A REQUEST HERE TODAY TO SUPPORT THE AUDIT REQUEST THIS IS AN GREEN. A FACULTY MEMBER FROM CSU CHICO. THANK YOU WILL MOVE TO YOUR WITNESS AND SUPPORT. GOOD MORNING CHAIR SALAS AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS SUSAN GREEN AND I'M A FACULTY MEMBER CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY CHICO. ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA FACULTY ASSOCIATION WHICH REPRESENTS TWENTY NINE THOUSAND FACULTY FROM CAMPUSES ARE FROM ALL TWENTY THREE OF OUR CAMPUSES AND CALIFORNIA STATE. UNIVERSITY SYSTEM WE'RE HERE TO SUPPORT THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER BORDER HER GRAPHS AUDIT REQUEST OF CAMPUS BASED STUDENT FEES IN THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY. I WANTED TO DRAW YOUR ATTENTION TO A SIMPLE CHART THAT WAS CREATED BY THE CSU WHICH WERE PROVIDED TO MANY OF YOUR STAFF AND TO SOME OF YOU IN PERSON. OUR AS WE DISCUSS THIS AUDIT YOU'LL SEE THAT AT LEAST ONE CASE THE CAMPUS BASED STUDENT FEES ARE SO HIGH THAT THEY ALMOST DOUBLE THE TUITION FOR THE SAN LUIS OBISPO CAMPUS WHICH THE MEMBER JUST MENTIONED. I ALSO WANT TO POINT OUT THE AT IF WE LOOK AT THAT SAME CHART IT SHOWS THAT SOME CAMPUSES A CHARGE SOME TYPE OF FEES AND OTHERS DO NOT. FOR EXAMPLE THE STUDENT SUCCESS BE CAN BE AS HIGH AS A HUNDRED FIFTY FOUR DOLLARS AT SAN LUIS OBISPO. SIX HUNDRED AND FIFTY FOUR DOLLARS AT SAN JOSE WHILE SOME CAMPUSES CHARGE ZERO WHY IS THAT. I ALSO WANTED TO PROVIDE A MORE PERSONAL EXPERIENCE STORY I'M A FACULTY MEMBER AT CHICO STATE AND IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE CAMPUS ADOPTED THREE CAMPUS BASED STUDENT FEE INCREASES. FOR HEALTH SERVICES STUDENT LEARNING AND ATHLETICS OVER THE REJECTION OF THE STUDENTS. GOVERNOR BROWN PROVIDED ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO THE SYSTEM DEPENDENT ON NO TUITION INCREASES IN. TWENTY EIGHTEEN TWENTY NINETEEN AND STUDENTS NATURALLY ASSUMED THAT THIS WOULD INCLUDE CAMPUS BASED FEES IN THE SAME SPIRIT. BUT THAT WAS NOT THE CASE. STUDENTS WERE LEFT QUESTIONING WHETHER THE FEES WERE NECESSARY AND HOW THEY WERE SPENT PARTICULARLY IN REGARDS TO MENTAL HEALTH ACCESS AND WAIT TIMES WHICH DID NOT IMPROVE DESPITE THE INCREASED REVENUES FROM ALL SOURCES. AS YOU ARE AWARE THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE AUDIT. THEY CAME OUT LAST WEEK OF THE CSU -- HAVE ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IN OUTSIDE ACCOUNTS RAISES QUESTIONS FOR THE LEGISLATURE AND FOR US AS WELL. THE CSU MAY NOT HAVE DONE ANYTHING WRONG BUT CLEARLY DEMONSTRATES THE NEED FOR GREATER TRANSPARENCY AND COMMUNICATIONS SURROUNDING REVENUES. THE STUDENTS THEIR PARENTS THE TAXPAYERS ARE YOU YOURSELVES DESERVE MORE THAN OPEC CHAU GAMES FROM THE CSU. WE ASK THAT YOU ADOPT THIS AUDIT SO THAT AT A MINIMUM WE HAVE ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY IN REGARDS TO CAMPUS BASED STUDENT FEES. AND THE AUDIT MAY SHED A LIGHT ON SOMETHING THAT THE LEGISLATURE AND THE PUBLIC WOULD LIKE TO TAKE FURTHER ACTION ON TO CORRECT THANK YOU. THANK YOU WITH THAT WE WILL GO TO MOVE TO THE STATE AUDITOR'S PRESENTATION. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS AS ASSEMBLYMEMBER BERNHARDT BATH INDICATED -- WE'D BE LOOKING AT THE CSU SYSTEM STARTING OUT LOOKING AT BOTH THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES IN THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE WITH RESPECT TO THE ADOPTION ANY POLICIES AND PROCEDURES ARE GUIDES THAT COMES. FROM HEADQUARTERS ESSENTIALLY ARE TO THE CAMPUSES BUT THE AGAIN THE FOR INDIVIDUAL CAMPUSES IS WHERE WE WOULD DRILL DOWN AND GO OUT AND LOOK AT EACH OF THOSE CAMPUSES SHE'S ASKING US TO LOOK AT A FIVE YEAR WINDOW. AND LOOK AT THE PROCESS FOR ORIGINATING APPROVING IMPLEMENTING A FEE IF THERE HAVE BEEN FEE INCREASES HOW DID THAT HAPPEN. IN THE EVENT THERE NEEDED TO BE A STUDENT REFERENDUM DID THAT OCCUR -- IF THE STUDENTS REJECTED THE THE PARTICULAR FEE INCREASE WAS IT WAS IT. SATISFIED IN SOME OTHER WAY. IS A QUESTION SHE'S ASKED CERTAINLY ASKING ABOUT THE IMPACT AND THE IMPLICATIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE COST OF ATTENDING THOSE FOR PARTICULAR INSTITUTIONS -- TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE WE WILL DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT STUDENTS ARE ABLE TO USE FINANCIAL AID TO IT TO PAY FOR SOME OF THE SPECIES. AND LOOKING AT SOME OF THE BACKGROUND MATERIALS TO PREPARE FOR THE HEARING I SAW THERE ARE SOME INSTANCES WHERE STUDENTS CANNOT USE FINANCIAL AID. SO THERE ARE CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE STUDENTS ARE HAVING TO PAY THIS OUT OF POCKET AND WE WOULD BE ABLE. TO CONDUCT THAT TYPE OF ANALYSIS DETERMINE WHICH FEES OUR STUDENTS CAN USE FINANCIAL AID TO PAY FOR AN AND THOSE FOR WHICH THEY CANNOT -- WHAT ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES ARE EACH OF THE CAMPUS'S ENGAGING IN TO MAKE SURE THAT IF THE FEE REVENUE IS GENERATED FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE THAT THE EXPENDITURES AND WE WOULD TEST EXPENDITURES TO MAKE SURE? THAT THOSE CAMPUSES WERE ONLY USING THOSE FUNDS FOR THOSE PARTICULAR PURPOSE IS TO PROVIDE ASSURANCE KNOWING TO STUDENTS AND PARENTS BUT THE GENERAL PUBLIC THAT. THE INSTITUTIONS ARE BEING FISCAL STEWARDS OF THESE FUNDS ARE THE REVENUES THAT ARE GENERATED -- AND THEN A COUPLE OF FINAL OBJECTIVES DETERMINE WHETHER THE CAMPUS BASED REVENUES ARE FUNDING PROGRAMS OR SERVICES. FOR THAT WERE NOT INCLUDED IN THE PARTICULAR RIFF REFERENDUM SO IS MONEY BEING GENERATED AND USED FOR OTHER PURPOSES SIMILAR TO THE EXPENDITURE TESTING WE'RE DOING BUT HOLISTICALLY LOOKING AT AT AT SOME OF THE STUDENT FEES. ARE AND THEN WHAT KIND OF MECHANISMS DO THE CAMPUSES ENGAGE AND TO INFORM STUDENTS NOT JUST ABOUT THE A PARTICULAR A FEE THAT MAY BE. NEEDING STUDENT APPROVAL OR AND ARE INCREASING BY. THE USE OF THOSE FUNDS OF THE STUDENTS IMPROVE THEIR THE REFERENDUM AND THAT THERE IS NOW AN ADDITIONAL FEE. HOW WELL DO THOSE RESPECTIVE CAMPUSES COMMUNICATE WITH THE STUDENT BODY AS TO HOW THAT MONEY IS BEING USED -- AND WHAT BENEFITS ARE BEING DERIVED FROM THAT PARTICULAR REVENUE -- THE HOURS FOR THIS AUDIT THIRTY TWO HUNDRED HOURS AGAIN WE'RE GONNA VISIT FOUR CAMPUSES WE'RE GONNA GO THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE DOWN IN LONG BEACH -- CERTAINLY HAVE SOME INFORMATION ARE GATHERING WITH RESPECT TO DECISIONS AT THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES HAVE MADE AND WHAT GUIDANCE THEY'VE PROVIDED TO THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE AND CERTAINLY -- TO THOSE FOUR CAMPUSES WE WERE WE WERE REFERRING TO WITH THAT MISTER CHAIR I WILL ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS MEMBERS HAVE THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION AT THIS TIME WE'RE GONNA GO TO MOVE TO THE AFFECTED AGENCIES OF CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY IS HERE. PLEASE BEGIN BY STATING YOUR NAME. FOR THE RECORD WOULD APPRECIATE THAT. PLEASE PROCEED WITH TESTIMONY. A GOOD MORNING ON BEHALF OF THE CSU OFFICE OF THE CHANCELLOR THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE THE UNIVERSITIES PERSPECTIVE. AS YOU CONSIDER AN AUDIT ON CSU CAMPUS BASED FEES. MY NAME IS RYAN STORM HIGH IN THE SYSTEM VICE CHANCELLOR FOR BUDGET FOR THE OFFICE OF THE CHANCELLOR WITH ME AS ASSOCIATE VICE CHANCELLOR -- FOR BUSINESS FINANCE BRED WELLS WHO'S HERE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS ALONG WITH ME -- ON YOUR ON THIS -- ON THIS AUDIT -- FOR MYSELF I'M. A PARTICULAR RESPONSIBLE FOR MATTERS RELATED TO STUDENT FEES -- AS ALL DESCRIBING A MOMENT THERE ARE MANY TYPES OF FEES OF THE SEA ISSUE. AND IT IS IMPORTANT NOTE THAT FEES PAY FOR DIRECT SERVICES AND RESOURCES SUCH AS THE USE OF STUDENT RECREATIONAL FAILITIES. HEALTH SERVICES AND INSTRUCTION RELATED ACTIVITIES. OUR STUDENTS RECEIVE -- DIRECT BENEFITS FROM THESE FEES THEY ENHANCE OR SUPPLEMENT THE EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCE OF THIS ISSUE. WITH THAT SAID A GOAL OF OURS IS TO KEEP COLLEGE AFFORDABLE FOR OUR STUDENTS. SALOME TO CLARIFY SOME OF THE QUESTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED AS YOU CONSIDER THIS AUDIT. WHEN THE QUESTIONS WAS DOES THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES HAVE POLICIES IN PLACE FOR THE ADOPTION OF CAMPUS BASED STUDENT FEES OR THE IS DETERMINED? ON A CAMPUS BY CAMPUS BASIS SO THE ANSWER IS YES ABSOLUTELY THE TRUSTEES HAVE A COMPREHENSIVE STUDENT FEE POLICY DATING. TO NINETEEN NINETY SIX BUT GOVERNS THIS PROCESS AS WELL AS OTHER TYPES OF FEES. THE MOST CURRENT VERSION OF THAT STUDENT FEE POLICY IS IN EXECUTIVE ORDER. ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED TWO AND CAN BE FOUND ON OUR INTERNET SITE. ANOTHER QUESTION THAT WAS POSED A WHAT ARE THE CATEGORIES OF FEES AND FOR WHAT SPECIFIC PURPOSES CAN THOSE FUNDS BE EXPENDED. NOT A STUDENT FEE POLICY ESTABLISHES SIX CATEGORIES OF FEES WHICH IS NOT TO BE CONFUSED WITH THE SIX TYPES OF CAMPUS BASED FEES THAT ARE CITED HERE SOME TALKING ABOUT THE SIX CATEGORIES. RUNNING FROM MOST SYSTEM WIDE ALL THE WAY DOWN -- TO VOLUNTARY FEES SO FIRST. THERE ARE COMMON SYSTEM WHY TUITION AND FEES THAT ALL STUDENTS WAS PAY REGARDLESS OF THE CAMPUS THEY TEND SUCH AS A SYSTEM WIDE TUITION. A SECOND THERE ARE CAMPUS BASED MANDATORY FEES SPECIFIC TO EACH CAMPUS THAT ALL STUDENTS ON THAT. CAMPUS MUST PAY. SUCH AS CAMPUS HEALTH SERVICES OUR STUDENTS UNION FEES -- THIRD COURSE FEES ARE FOR MATERIALS AND SERVICES ONLY FOR STUDENTS ENROLLED IN THOSE SPECIFIC COURSES SO OFTEN BECOME A FAD THE FACULTY MEMBER WHO'S REPRESENTING HERE TODAY HAS A PARTICULAR COURSE THAT REQUIRE SUPPLEMENTAL -- SUPPLIES ARE MATERIALS IN THERE ARE PARTICULAR FEES FOR THOSE PARTICULAR COARSENESS -- FOURTH THERE ARE ADMINISTRATIVE FEES FOR SUCH ITEMS AS ENROLLMENT DEPOSITS FOR LIBRARY FINES AND IF YOU PARTICIPATE IN AN INTERNATIONAL PROGRAM -- FIFTH CATEGORY ARE FEES FOR SELF SUPPORT PROGRAMS THESE ARE THINGS SUCH AS PARKING FOR HOUSING. AND FOR PROFESSIONAL CONTINUING EDUCATION. LASTLY THERE IS A SIX SYSTEM WIDE VOLUNTARY FEE. AND THAT SUPPORTS THE ACTIVITIES OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE STUDENT ASSOCIATION -- THE REPRESENTATIVE ENTITIES OF STUDENTS AT THIS ISSUE. SIR THERE ARE SEVERAL OTHER QUESTIONS INCLUDED IN THIS AUDIT REQUEST. AND I DO NOT WANT TO TAKE ANYMORE OF YOUR TIME TODAY SO I WILL I WILL LEAVE YOU WITH THIS -- MANY OF THE ANSWERS TO THOSE QUESTIONS ARE READILY AVAILABLE -- ON THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE AS WELL AS CAMPUS INTERNET SITES. IN THE RARE INSTANCE IN WHICH DETAILS ARE NOT READILY AVAILABLE ONLINE -- THE INFORMATION CAN BE EASILY PROVIDED BY CHANCES OFFICE MY OFFICE. OR CAMPUS STAFF AND TAKE YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO COMMENT. THANK YOU -- WITH THAT WE WILL GOOD IN RETURN BACK TO MEMBERS ON THE DÃ­AS. FOR QUESTIONS BUT LET ME JUST -- BEGIN BECAUSE I HEARD SOME COMMENTS ON THIS BUT LET ME ASK -- THE REPRESENTATIVES FROM CSU. AT DOES FINANCIAL AID COVER THE FEES. WE SURE DO -- THEIR NUMBER OF FINANCIALLY PROGRAMS -- YOU HAVE A YOU HAVE. CAL GRANTS THAT WILL COVER -- ACROSS THE BOARD TUITION BUT THEN THERE ARE OTHER ELEMENTS OF THE CAL GRANT PROGRAM WHERE -- THEY THEY CALL IT AND THAT AND ACCESS WARDER AND FOR LACK OF BETTER TERM -- THOSE WILL COVER FEES YOU HAVE FEDERAL -- FEDERAL PROGRAMS WHERE THOSE WILL COVER FEES YOU ALSO HAVE THE STATE UNIVERSITY GRANT PROGRAM SO THERE ARE MYRIAD OF FINANCIALLY PROGRAMS THAT WILL COVER THOSE FEES. GOT IT SO. THERE ARE PROGRAMS LIKE COVER SOME OF THE FEES ARE OUR MOST THE FEES. OKAY I HAVE AN ADDITIONAL QUESTION BUT ALL FIRST OF FOR TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER WHAT. THANK YOU MISTER THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I'M I'M LOOKING AT THIS LIST AND I'M A LITTLE. A LITTLE STE SURPRISED -- OF ONE OF THE UNITS KELSEY UNIVERSITIES I REPRESENT THAT SENT -- ACTUALLY THE ONLY ONE I pREPRESENT IS NUMBER FOUR ON THE LIST FOR FEES. AND ANOTHER THAT A LOT OF STUDENTS ARE COME FROM MY DISTRICT TO GO TO SOME OF THE STATE UNIVERSITY IS IS RIGHT UP THERE AS WELL SO. TO TO THE TOP FOR FEES. AREAS ARE ARE ARE NEAR AND DEAR TO MY CAN MY CONSTITUENTS -- THERE SEEMS TO BE GREAT DISPARITY ACROSS THESE AS FAR AS THE AMOUNTS FOR TWO PARTICULAR FEES. I GUESS WHEN I THINK OF IN STRUCTURAL INSTRUCTION ONLY RELATED ACTIVITIES I THINK THOSE ARE THINGS THAT FEEL LIKE THEY SHOULD BE WRITTEN PARTY YOUR TUITION. I UNDERSTAND COURSE MATERIALS BECAUSE I UNDERSTAND THAT AS SOMEONE WHO HAD A SCIENCE -- BACKGROUND THE BOOKS WERE MORE EXPENSIVE IN THE LABS WERE MORE EXPENSIVE. BUT I ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT INSTRUCTION ONLY RELATED ACTIVITIES WERE LIKE THINGS LIKE CLASSES AND THINGS LIKE THAT SO I'M A LITTLE PUZZLED BY THAT ALSO I'M DISAPPOINTED TO SEE THE REAL HIGH COST OF HEALTH SERVICES BUT ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT I AM IN A HEALTH MANPOWER SHORTAGE AREA AND THAT. IS A WHOLE NOTHER ISSUE WHICH WE COULD TALK ABOUT FOR A LONG TIME -- SO -- I THINK ONE OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE WE KEEP HEARING I KEEP HEARING FROM MY STUDENTS. IN MY IN MY FROM HUMBOLDT STATE UNIVERSITY IN PARTICULAR IS THAT IT IS REALLY REALLY EXPENSIVE TO GO TO SCHOOL THERE AND PEOPLE THINK BECAUSE IT'S A SMALL UNIVERSITY. IN A RURAL AREA IT WOULDN'T BE BUT IT'S NOT. THERE EVERYTHING IS HIGHER TRANSPORTATION COSTS ARE HIGHER FOOD IS HIGHER RENT CAN BE HIGH GASOLINE IS HIGH AND SO THE SUIT STUDENTS ARE STRUGGLING. SO PART IS WHAT I LIKE THIS MAKES ME FEEL A LITTLE BIT LIKE IT'S ALMOST LIKE THE AIRLINES WERE YOU GOT TO PAY FOR YOUR BAGS. YOUR YOU YOU KNOW YOU GET PEANUTS BUT YOU GOT TO BY ANY OTHER FOOD -- SO -- I'M REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO THIS SIDE X. SIDE I THINK THIS STUDENTS OF HUMBOLDT STATE UNIVERSITY IN THE OTHER UNIVERSITIES -- DESERVE TO KNOW WHAT THESE FEES ARE FOR WHERE THEY'RE GOING ESPECIALLY IN LIGHT OF THE FACT THAT WE'VE GOT AND HOW THIS ALL PLAYS INTO THAT ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS SURPLUS IT SITTING OUT THERE SO. THANK YOU ABSOLUTELY I THINK THAT'S A WERE MY LINE OF QUESTIONING WAS GOING AS WELL JUST BY MY QUICK MATH I WAS LOOKING AT SAN LUIS OBISPO -- STUDENT FEES IF THIS IS CORRECT FOUR THOUSAND SEVENTY FOUR DOLLARS FOR STUDENT FEES BUT TUITIONS FIVE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED AND FORTY TWO QUICK MATH SAYS IT'S US ABOUT 71%. OF YOUR TUITION COSTS IT WAS STUDENT FEES. SO LET ME ASK YOU KNOW AND AND I AM ON THE OTHER AND YOU LOOK AT CAL STATE LOS ANGELES WHICH AS A STUDENT FEES OF A LITTLE OVER A THOUSAND DOLLARS. AND WHEN YOU DO THE MATH ON THAT'S ABOUT 18% -- SO LET ME JUST ASK A CSU WHY SO MUCH DISCREPANCY WERE ONE UNIVERSITY WOULD CHARGE APPROXIMATELY 18% OF WHAT TUITION IS. IN STUDENT FEES WERE ANOTHER WOULD CHARGE NEARLY 71%. WELL THE ANSWER CAN BE AS DIVERSE AS THE THE OPTIONS THAT YOU HAVE LAID OUT IN FRONT OF YOU I HAVE A DIFFERENT CHART I DON'T I WAS IN PROVIDED THAT. THE MATERIALS THAT YOU HAVE IN FRONT OF YOU BUT I DO HAVE A A SIMILAR CHART. IT GENERALLY SPEAKING I WOULD SAY THAT -- IF YOU GO BACK. IN TIME TO DECADES AGO THE STRUCTURE OF THE SEA ISSUE IS GENERALLY THIS THAT THE STATE WOULD PROVIDE ACCESS TO THE UNIVERSITY WOULD HIRE THE FACULTY THE INSTRUCTIONAL. US SUPPORT FOR THAT FOR STUDENTS. IN AND FEES. WERE AN ADDITIONAL. SERVICE THAT DISTINGUISH PARTICULAR NEED IF A STUDENT NEEDED HOUSING. THEY WOULD BY HOUSING SEPARATELY FROM. ACCESS TO THE UNIVERSITY IF THEY NEEDED TO BUY A PARKING PASS BECAUSE THEY WERE DRIVING CURRENT CAMPUS SAME SORT OF THING RIGHT SINCE THAT TIME SINCE THE PERFECT MODEL WAS LAID OUT DECADES AGO WE HAVE MANY RECESSIONS MANY CHANGES IN GENERAL FUND AMOUNTS. AND WHAT IS ULTIMATELY HAPPENED IS YOU HAVE A SITUATION WHERE THIS UNIVERSITY YES NEARLY HALF FUNDED BY STATE GENERAL FUND. NEARLY HALF FUNDED BY TUITION AND FEES. IT TO YOUR PARTICULAR QUESTION ABOUT THE VARIANCE IN IN CAMPUSES. SEND US OBISPO FOR EXAMPLE THEY ARE AND AND ADD IN AN EXPERIMENTAL PROGRAM RIGHT. HI HIGH LEVEL OF NUMBER OF STUDENTS ARE ENGINEERS. THEIR AGRICULTURALIST THERE IS A MUCH GREATER EMPHASIS ON ON LEARNING BY DOING AND BECAUSE OF THAT THE REQUIRES ADDITIONAL EQUIPMENT. REQUIRES DISTANT DISH EDUCATIONAL SUPPLIES IN SOME OF THOSE FEES ARE RELATED TO THAT SORT OF EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCE -- THE OTHER THING TO TO TO POINT OUT AS WELL IS THAT -- THE WAY THAT OUR CAMPUS BASED FEES AND THAT'S PROBABLY THE CHART THAT YOU HAVE IN FRONT OF YOU -- THE WAY THAT OUR POLICY WORKS IS THAT A CAMPUS BASE FEE NEEDS TO BE ORIGINATED AT THE CAMPUS LEVEL. BY STUDENTS THE ADMINISTRATION BY THAT CAMPUS. THAT IS THEN FORWARDED TO THE UNIVERSITIES -- HEADQUARTERS TO THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE AND THERE IS WHERE ALSO A RIGOROUS -- REVIEW OF THAT FEE IS. IS TAKING A LOOK AT AND ULTIMATELY APPROVED OR DENIED BY THE CHANCE AT THAT LEVEL NOW THERE ARE A BATTERY OF WAYS IN WHICH THESE CAMPUS BASED FEES CAN BE CREATED IT CAN BE -- CREATED BY REFERENDUM OF STUDENTS -- FROM THEIR INSIGHT IT CAN BE ORIGINATED BY THE PRESIDENT. THROUGH SOMETHING THAT WE CALL ALTERNATIVE CONSULTATION YOU'LL SEE THAT PROBABLY IN THE PRODUCT OF THE OF THE AUDIT REPORT. WHERE IT'S NOT ALWAYS THE PERFECT -- SITUATION. TO HAVE JUST A GENERAL VOTE ABOUT A PARTICULAR FEE -- ONE STRATEGY FOR EXAMPLE THAT WE HAVE FOUND TO BE A VERY GOOD. ONE IS. WHAT PARTICULAR CAMPUS WAS INITIATING A PARTICULAR FEE FOR THEIR ENTIRE CAMPUS AND IN ORDER TO DO BUSINESS AS A STUDENT THROUGH THE? PORTAL OF THAT PARTICULAR CAMPUS. STUDENT HAD TO ON THREE SEPARATE OCCASIONS DECLINE TO LOOK. AT FOR LET ME PUT IT THIS WAY THEY HAD TO REVIEW BEFORE THEY CAN MOVE ON TO BUSINESS THEY HAD TO REVIEW. A PROPOSAL IN FRONT OF THEM HEY THERE'S THIS FEE THAT IS IN FRONT OF YOU ARE YOU INTERESTED IN LEARNING MORE ABOUT IT IF NOT TO THESE OTHER OPTIONS OVER HERE WE CAN LOOK AT AND CONSIDER THIS. ARE ALL THAT IS IN FEES APPROVED BY THE STUDENT BODY. NO THEY ARE NOT. NO THEY'RE NOT BY STATUTE -- A STUDENT ASSOCIATION FEE IS CREATED BY STATUTE ARE BY BY A STUDENT REFERENDUM -- THERE ARE ALSO A RECENTLY THERE WAS A LOT THE PAST THAT -- THAT REQUIRED A STUDENT VOTE FOR A STUDENT SUCCESS FEES -- BUT OUR FEE POLICY LARGELY ROUTE. LARGELY RECOMMENCED THE FIRST APPROACH WHICH IS THAT YOU RECEIVE A VOTE OF ADVICE FROM STUDENTS IN TERMS OF WHETHER THIS FEE MAKES SENSE OR NOT. AND THEN IT IS UP TO THE PRESIDENT ON A CAMPUS BASED FEE BASIS TO TAKE IT FORWARD TO THE CHANCE SIR FOR APPROVAL WITH THAT INPUT IN MIND. AND ALSO OTHER ITEMS SO YOU HAVE CAMPUS WORKSHOPS YET. MEETINGS THOSE SORTS OF THINGS IT'S IT'S AT LARGE BATTERY OF INFORMATION COMES INTO OUR HAD QUIT. COMES INTO THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE TO REVIEW THOSE FEES. FOR CONSIDERATION FOR APPROVAL. THANK YOU ORDER TO MOVE TO CENTER DEMONIC THAT SENATOR ROTH. THANK YOU A MISTER CHAIR. IN THE SENATOR WOULD ALLUDED TO THE MEDIA COVERAGE OF A ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLAR SURPLUS -- I GUESS FOR THE REQUEST JOURNAL AND OR FOR THE AUDITOR WOULD LOOKING IT AVAILABLE SURPLUSES FACTOR INTO THIS ON IT. THAT WASN'T PART OF THE SCOPE OF THE AUDIT BUT IT WAS A LOOKING AT ARE THE FUNDS PUT IN SEPARATE ACCOUNTS AND ARE THEY USE FOR THE PURPOSES THEY WERE INTENDED. BY COULD JUST COMMENT ON THAT CENTER MONNING OUT WE ARE TWO J. LACK IN A NUMBER OF THE POLICY COMMITTEES IN BOTH HOUSES LOOKING AT HOSTING A HEARING. ON THAT PARTICULAR ISSUE -- THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF INTEREST FROM THE POLICY COMMITTEES AS WELL. AND WE ARE COORDINATING THE TIMES IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S RIGHT WE GET BACK FROM BREAK THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THAT SO I WON'T BE LABOR AT THAT. I DO UNDERSTAND -- FROM THE CSU PERSPECTIVE THAT WHEN WE LOOK AT FEES SOMEWHERE SET -- IN THE SYSTEM WIDE AND THEN MANY OR DEVELOPED [inaudible] CAMPUS SPECIFIC -- ARE THE DECISIONS MADE AS TO SYSTEM WIDE. FEES OR COST BASED ON THE OVERALL BUDGET OF THE SEA ISSUE REVENUES IN. EXPENSES OUT. CERTAINLY THE THE FEE THAT YOU'RE YOU'RE WOULD BE THE FEE THAT WOULD BE MOST APPLICABLES TO WHETHER THE GENERAL FUND IS UP OR DOWN FOR THE C. ISSUE WOULD BE SYSTEM WIDE TUITION. THAT'S A THAT'S A DECISION THAT IS HELD BY THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES AND THEY MAKE THE FINAL DECISION ON WHETHER TUITION WERE TO GO UP AND DOWN DEPENDING ON THE AMOUNT OF GENERAL FUND IN WITH THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES BE MADE AWARE OF A ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLAR. SURPLUS THEY HAVE BEEN REGULARLY THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR OFF PLEASE YOU KNOW THIS -- CHART THAT WE WERE PROVIDED I REALIZE YOU DON'T HAVE THE BENEFIT OF HAVING IT SO I APOLOGIZE HOPEFULLY YOUR SHIRT HAS THE SAME DATA -- MAYBE SOMEONE CAN PROVIDE ONE TO YOU IF THEY HAVE. ONE THANK YOU OF THINK I HAVE ONE NOW. SO FOR EXAMPLE THE ONE I'M LOOKING AT UNDER THE CATEGORY OF CAMPUS MANDATORY FEES MATERIAL SERVICES AND FACILITIES WE HAVE CAL POLY POMONA. WAS. ZERO AND WE HAVE CAL POLY SAN LUIS OBISPO WITH TWELVE HUNDRED AND TEN DOLLARS. NOW CAN SOMEBODY EXPLAIN TO ME WHY THAT'S THE CASE GIVEN THE FACT THAT. MY RECOLLECTION IS ARE SOMEWHAT SIMILAR IN TERMS OF THEIR MISSION. SO DO I MEAN I THIS IS NOT I MEAN I THIS IS NOT KNOW YOUR BIBLE I WILL THAT'S WHY WE HAVE AN AUDITOR WHO MAY DO AN AUDIT HERE IF IT'S APPROVED. YEAH THE IT'S THE NAME SO SO THAT THAT CATEGORY MATERIAL SERVICES AND FACILITIES FEE. IS DERIVED FROM THE STATUTORY AUTHORITY FOR THAT SPECIFIC FEE SO DEPENDING ON HOW THE CAMPUS PROPOSES A FEE FOR EXAMPLE. IT MAY OR MAY NOT BE RECORDED IN THAT CATEGORY -- SAN LUIS OBISPO THE STUDENT SUCCESS FEE FOR EXAMPLE IS CALLED OUT SEPARATELY -- THE BECAUSE THE AUTHORITY TO FOR THAT PARTICULAR FEE WAS SUBSEQUENTLY MODIFIED -- PURSUANT TO THE LEGISLATION THAT RYAN SPOKE ABOUT EARLIER. SO IT IT MIGHT BE WHAT ONE WAY TO LOOK AT IS TO ADD IF YOU THINK ABOUT -- INSTRUCTIONAL RELATED ACTIVITIES WHICH IS ANOTHER STATUTORY DEFINITION MATERIAL SERVICES AND FACILITIES AND STUDENT SUCCESS TOGETHER. THOSE WITH MOST OFTEN BE FOR THINGS THAT ARE SIMILAR -- I WILL ACTUALLY I UNDERSTOOD THE EARLIER COMMENT WHEN. THE GENTLEMAN SPOKE ABOUT THE FACT THAT SAN LUIS OBISPO IS THERE'S AGRICULTURE IN THERE'S ENGINEERING AND YOU KNOW MAYBE YOU HAVE TO BUY THINGS BUT I AM HAVING DIFFICULTY. UNDERSTANDING THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ZERO AND TWELVE HUNDRED AND TEN AND AND AS TO THE EQUIPMENT ISN'T SOME OF THAT WOULDN'T SOME OF THAT BE FUNDED BY THE GENERAL FUND APPROPRIATION THAT WE PROVIDE -- TO TO SEE ISSUE IN GENERAL I MEAN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT PROVIDING AN EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCE AND I WOULD THINK THAT YOU WOULD BUDGET FOR THAT. IN YOUR BCP WOULD REFLECT THE THE COST OF OF THAT SORT OF EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITY CERTAINLY COULD COULD BE FOR SURE -- I THINK ONE OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE'VE EXPERIENCED OVER THE YEARS IS THAT -- WHEN WHEN GENERAL FUND HAS BEEN REDUCED AND AND NOT APPROPRIATELY BACK FILLED? WITH EITHER TUITION ARE GENERAL FUND IN THE FUTURE THAT THERE HAS BEEN A NEED -- TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE ACCESS FOR STUDENTS. AT OUR UNIVERSE IS AT THE SAME TIME BE ABLE TO INVEST IN -- THEIR EDUCATION AND THE INVOLVEMENT OF TECHNOLOGY IN TERMS OF THEIR EDUCATIONAL. IN TERMS OF THE SPECIFICS ABOUT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ZERO AND ELEVEN HUNDRED TWELVE HUNDRED DOLLARS THAT WOULD WHATEVER YOU CITED -- IT WOULD REQUIRE US TO GO BACK AND HAVE TO LOOK ON A CASE BY CASE BASIS WHAT EACH OF THOSE FEES ARE -- YOU KNOW WE WE WE HAVE SEVEN I THINK I THINK WE HAVE THAT WERE I THINK WE TALK ABOUT THE SAME TABLE HERE SO I THINK THIS IS ACTUALLY FROM MY OFFICE IS WEBSITE THAT DEPICTS THE CAMPUS BASED FEES. BUT IF YOU DO THE MATH HERE -- JUST IN TERMS OF CATEGORIES YOU'RE LOOKING AT A HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE DIFFERENT CATEGORIES OF FEES BECAUSE YOU'VE TWENTY THREE CAMPUSES AND HAVE -- SEVEN SIX SEVEN A DIFFERENT FEES AND THEN WITHIN THAT THIS ISN'T JUST ONE PARTICULAR FEE IT COULD BE. A COLLECTION OF THOSE SPECIFIC FEES ON THE CAMPUS SO THERE COULD HAVE BEEN ONE THAT WAS CREATED FOR FIVE DOLLARS AND IN NINETEEN SEVENTY AND THEN THERE COULD HAVE BEEN ONE THAT WAS SUGGESTED LATER. SO WE HAVE TO GO BACK AND DO AND MAYBE THAT'S PART OF THE THE AUDITOR'S WORK IS THAT WHEN YOU ARE LOOKING ON A CAMPUS BY CAMPUS BASIS WHAT THOSE PARTICULAR FEE DOLLARS ARE IN TOTAL I DON'T HAVE ALL THE ANSWERS FOR ALL OF THE CAMPUS IS IN ALL. OF THE FEES AT MY DISPOSAL RIGHT NOW. BUT OBVIOUSLY WE CAN FOLLOW UP IF YOU HAVE A PARTICULAR -- HE'S BEEN PHRASE YOU WANT ME TO TO TO RESEARCHERS WELL WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS WITH THIS ORDER REQUEST WE MAY ACTUALLY. HAVE THE ANSWERS WHICH YOU WILL PARTICIPATE IN THE FORM OF A STATE AUDITOR'S REPORT SO. THANK YOU FOR THE INFORMATION THANK YOU MISTER. THANK YOU ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS FROM THE DÃ­AS. A SENATOR GONZALEZ PLEASE. AND I APOLOGIZE IF IT'S BEEN ASKED THAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD -- WHEN WAS THE STUDENT SUCCESS BE ENACTED? WELL THIS TO SUCCESS FEE -- I THINK THE EARLIEST ONE WAS WHEN THAT FIRST OF ALL IS TO SUCCESSFULLY IS A CAMPUS BASED FEE THAT IS ORIGINATED BY EACH CAMPUS. FIRST ONE THE EARLIEST ONE THAT WE CONSIDER A STUDENT SUCCESS FEE. AREAS WAS GREAT IN. TWO THOUSAND EIGHT THE LAST ONE THAT WAS CREATED. WAS IN TWENTY FOURTEEN MAY OF TWENTY FOURTEEN SO LITTLE OVER FIVE YEARS AGO -- AND THEY ARE AND AND AND MAD MAD JUST LITTLE BIT TO THAT. THEY'RE VERY SIMILAR -- TO THE INSTRUCTION RELATED ACTIVITIES THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT HERE AS WELL AS MATERIAL SERVICES AND FACILITIES FEES IN FACT. WE WOULD ARGUE THAT THEY ARE A SUBSET OF THE MATERIAL SERVICES FEE -- PAYS FOR A LOT OF THE EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCE AND THEN THE INSTRUCTION RELATED ACTIVITIES SORTS OF THINGS SO. AND PERHAPS -- AND I KNOW WE'VE SOME I TALKED ABOUT THIS BUT PERHAPS THAT COULD BE OBVIOUSLY LOOKED AT AND WITHIN THE AUDIT TO SEE HOW. SOME OF THEM MAY OR MAY NOT BE SUBSETS AND WHY THEY MAY NOT BE -- ONE FEE AND A LITTLE BIT MORE IN ALIGNMENT WITH EACH OTHER -- IF IF I MAY ALSO WE DO WE ARE STATUTORILY REQUIRED TO PROVIDE INFORMATION ON STUDENT SUCCESS FEES EVERY YEAR AND WE HAVE A REPORT THAT WE ISSUE EVERY YEAR AND IS AVAILABLE ONLINE AT ALL TIMES. SO IT WHAT THAT DOES IS IT DETAILS OUT WHICH CAMPUSES HAVE STUDENT SUCCESS FEES WHAT THEY WHAT THEY PAY. FOR AS WELL AS IF THERE ARE ANY CHANGES TO THOSE FEES -- OR RICK THE LIMITATIONS ARE CREATION OF NEW ONES SO THAT INFORMATION'S VERY READILY AVAILABLE. GREAT AND I HAVE A QUESTION -- THE HEALTH FACILITIES AND HEALTH SERVICES AND I KNOW -- THERE SOME ZEROS -- VERY FEW BUT THERE'S SOME OF THOSE HAVE THERE BEEN. ANY DISCUSSIONS ABOUT. PERHAPS MAKING THEM NON MANDATORY -- JUST GIVEN THE FACT THAT SOME STUDENTS MAY OR MAY NOT BE TRADITIONAL BUT HAVE THEIR OWN HEALTH INSURANCE IN MAY -- NOT NEED THIS -- PARTICULAR. SERVICE NO WE HAVEN'T ANY DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THAT. OKAY -- THINK THOSE ARE ALL MY QUESTIONS BUT I JUST. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR OPENNESS AND I LOOK FOR TO APPROVING THIS TODAY. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU WITHOUT WILL MOVE TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER WHAT. YET THEN JUST TO FOLLOW UP ON AND I AM. FASCINATED BY THE STUDENT SUCCESS FEE BECAUSE I WOULD HOPE THAT THE UNIVERSITY'S MISSION IS TO MAKE SURE ALSO STUDENTS FROM OUR SUCCESSFUL. AND I'M ALSO FASCINATED BY THE FACT THAT SUMMER ZERO AND SOME ARE VERY LARGE SO I GUESS SOME PEOPLE WANT THEIR UNIVERSE THEIR UNIVERSES BE EVEN MORE SUCCESSFUL. I'M CURIOUS ABOUT THE WIDE REALLY VERY INTERESTED IN THESE FEES AND HOW THEY ARE SPEND I CAN. I CAN SEE THAT IF YOU'RE BOUNCING AROUND AND YOU'RE CAUGHT USE YOU'RE LOOKING AT SOME OF THESE MAY BE RELATED TO INSTRUCTIONAL RELATED ACTIVITIES WHICH ALSO THANK. SHOULD BE PART OF TUITION. ARE THEIR DISCLOSURES TO STUDENTS UP FRONT. BECAUSE I'LL GO BACK TO MY AIRPLANE ANALOGY. THIS FEELS LIKE HIS THIS IS TUITION BUT YOU GOT ALL THESE ADDITIONAL FEES THERE THEY GET TACKED ON TO THE BILL. AND YOU DON'T REALLY KNOW THAT UNTIL YOU BUY THE TICKET. SO HOW MUCH OF THIS IS TRULY DISCLOSED UP FRONT TO FAMILIES AND PROSPECTIVE STUDENTS SO THEY ACTUALLY KNOW. WHAT THEY'RE GETTING I WAS BEEN A LONG TIME SINCE I'VE BEEN IN COLLEGE I WAS A UC STUDENT AND I RECOGNIZE THERE WERE FEES? BUT I WILL TELL YOU OF THAT PROPORTION TO THE TRADITION TO TO THE TUITION AND WITH NOTHING LIKE THIS. NOT EVEN CLOSE. SO IT JUST FEELS LIKE AN EXPLOSION OF THESE ADDED ON FEES. THAT ARE GOING SOMEWHERE WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY WHY WE'RE GOING TO DO THIS AUDIT -- FEDERAL LAW REQUIRES ONLY THE UNIVERSITIES ALL PROVIDE INFORMATION ABOUT THE COST OF ATTENDANCE PRIOR -- TO PAYMENT OR REGISTRATION SO. WELL PART OF THE ISSUES YOU'RE LOOKING AT THESE IN AGGREGATE IF YOU LOOK AT EACH CAMPUSES OF WEBSITE YOU'LL SEE -- THE FEES LAID OUT FOR THAT SPECIFIC CAMPUS. AND AGAIN T'S REQUIRED TO BE DISCLOSED PRIOR -- TO AT AT THE TIME OF APPLICATION AND THERE'S NO I MEAN THERE THESE THINGS ARE ALL OVER THE BOARD SO THERE'S NO OVERSIGHT ABOUT THAT THIS IS THESE ARE REASONABLE -- OR THE I UNDERSTAND THEY DO GO THROUGH REVIEW BUT IT IT FEELS LIKE. CAMPUSES. ARE PRETTY AUTONOMOUS. YEAH EACH YEAR IS RYAN INDICATED WE COLLECT THIS INFORMATION -- BOTH AFTER THE FEE HAS BEEN PASS BUT ALSO WHILE EACH INDIVIDUAL FEE IS BEING PROPOSED. THAT DATA IS AGGREGATED AND REPORTED TO THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES ANNUALLY. AND TYPICALLY BEFORE THE BUDGET ACT BROUGHT PROCESS AND COMPARISONS ARE MADE AMONGST CAMPUSES AND BETWEEN CAMPUSES AND OTHER NATIONAL COMPARISON INSTITUTIONS. SO IS THERE NO EFFORTS USE -- TO USE THE BUYING POWER OF TWENTY THREE UNIVERSITIES TO HELP WITH SOME OF THESE. IN FEE REDUCTIONS -- I YOU KNOW I WOULD THINK THAT THERE MIGHT BE OPPORTUNITIES OUT THERE -- THAT WERE UNIVERSITY COULD ACTUALLY WORK IN CONCERT TO USE THE POWER OF OF TWENTY THREE VERSES THE POWER OF ONE YES -- I WE CONSIDER THE POWER OF TWENTY THREE TO BE TWENTY TWO UNIVERSITIES TEND UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA AND OVER A HUNDRED AND TEN COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND WE ENGAGE IN -- COLLECTIVE PURCHASING PROGRAM -- THAT'S BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL REPORTED TO THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES LAST YEAR SAVINGS IN -- OF THE IN EXCESS OF TWENTY THREE MILLION JUST FROM AGGREGATE CONTRACTS. THE GOAL TODAY THIS YEAR'S MUCH LARGER WILL BE REPORTING TO THE BOARD -- ON THE SAVINGS RESULTING FROM THOSE EFFORTS AND JAN JANUARY I BELIEVE BECAUSE OF GENDER JANUARY. SO MAYBE THIS AUDIT MAYBE YOU KNOW THIS WHAT IS THE CUMULATIVE TOTAL OF THESE FEES FOR THE OVER THE TWENTY THREE CAMPUSES IT'S YEAH IT'S A BIG AND I DON'T HAVE AN EXAMPLE IT'S A REALLY WHEN YOU SAID TWENTY THREE MATT YOU'VE GOT. Q. YOU'RE YOU'RE YOU'RE GETTING SAVINGS OF TWENTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS THAT FEELS LIKE A DROP IN THE BUCKET TO WHAT THIS NUMBER IS FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY FOUR THOUSAND STUDENTS -- THERE'S A THAT'S THIS IS A BIG NUMBER IT'S A REALLY REALLY BIG REALLY AND I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY -- MISTER HART ABOUT WHY SHE WANTS LOOK IN IT INTO A WITH THE HOT IT DISCREPANCY NOT ONLY IN THE STUDENT SUCCESS BECAUSE WE WANT ALL STUDENTS TO BE SUCCESSFUL. BUT WHY SOME CAMPUSES ARE ZERO OTHERS CHARGE A LITTLE BIT MORE BUT EVEN THE FEES OVERALL LIKE EARLIER JUST BY ROUGH MATH 71%. OF THE TUITION COSTS WAS FEES FOR SAN LUIS OBISPO FOR INSTANCE WHICH ARE THE CSU RESPONDED TO BUT HOPEFULLY. THIS OUGHT TO GET APPROVED WHILE WILL SHED A LITTLE MORE LIGHT ON THAT. THAT YOU HAD A COMMENT ON MR WHICH QUESTIONS -- TO TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF WHETHER STUDENTS ARE INVOLVED IN UNDERSTANDING WHAT THESE FEES ARE AND WHETHER THEY'RE GOING UP OR DOWN OR BEING ADJUSTED -- BYE BYE FEE POLICY WE REQUIRE THAT CAMPUSES HAVE A FEE ADVISORY COMMITTEE. AND THE VAST MAJORITY OF THAT FEE ADVISORY COMMITTEE IS POPULATED BY STUDENT REPRESENTATIVES. SO. THE MAN THE GENERAL CONDUCT OF THIS THESE BE ADVISORY COMMITTEE SAYS THERE'S IT'S A STANDING ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON CAMPUSES. IT'S PART OF THE ANNUAL BUDGET DEVELOPMENT PROCESS ON THE CAMPUSES. AND THEY HOLD REGULAR MEETINGS AND WHERE THERE ARE IDEAS IN AND CONVINCED CONSIDERATIONS ABOUT NEW FEES AND OR WHETHER THERE ARE FEES THAT ARE STATIC -- THESE -- THESE ADVISORY COMMITTEES ARE -- ARE DEFINITELY INVOLVING STUDENTS -- AND AND AND AND AND THEN -- ONE THING THAT WELL THAT'S A THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S IT I LOST MY TRAIN OF THOUGHT HIM AS A COMPLEX. THANK YOU -- WE HAVE SENATOR MORE LIKE THAT SENATOR MINING WITH ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS CENTER MORE LIKE IF YOU MISTER CHAIR JUST A QUICK QUESTION I MIGHT'VE MISSED AT THE BEGINNING BUT OF THE CATEGORIES YOU'VE YOU'VE GOT SIX I'M JUST CURIOUS WHY PARKING FEES WERE NOT INCLUDED. YES CENTER MORE LOCK -- THERE'S A STORM I WAS ASKING THE ASSEMBLY WOMAN BUT THANK YOU FOR MY DAD FOR JUMPING IN ARE YOU SHE WROTE THE LETTER YEAH.

ALL RIGHT SUTTER MONNING PLACE THANK YOU ON A QUICK FOLLOW UP ON ASSEMBLY MEMBER WOODS QUESTION -- THERE'S CURRENT FEDERAL LAW THAT REQUIRES WEBSITES TO SHOW SOME OF THE COST OF TUITION AND FEES. WE CURRENTLY HAVE SENATE BILL FOUR SIXTY SEVEN BROUGHT TO US BY STUDENTS FROM. CAL POLY SAN LUIS OBISPO SUPPORTED BY THE STATE WHAT ASSOCIATION THAT WOULD REQUIRE FURTHER INFORMATION INCLUDING HOUSING COSTS. FOR TWO BEDROOM IN ONE BEDROOM APARTMENTS. AND ON CAMPUS HOUSING. FORMER ASSEMBLYMEMBER CUT CHIU ASIDE GENE HAS BEEN COUNSELLING THE STUDENTS WHO BROUGHT THIS.

BY MYSELF IN ASSEMBLY MEMBER PATTERSON AND AT THIS TIME AGO IT IN HAND THE GAVEL OVER TO OUR VICE CHAIR MISTER RUFF GERMAN THE FLOOR IS YOURS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO PRESENT ON THIS ITEM TODAY -- BEFORE WE BEGIN I AM PREPARED TO REMOVE QUESTION FIVE FROM THE AUDIT LETTER. GIVEN LAST WEEK'S ACTIONS ON THE BUDGET MAKING THIS QUESTION. A MOOT POINT -- I'D ALSO LIKE TO INFORM THE COMMITTEE OF OUR DISCUSSIONS WITH THE ADMINISTRATION ON ACTUALLY DELAYED IMPLEMENTATION TO ALLOW THE STRIKE TEAM -- RESULTS TO ACTUALLY BE IMPLEMENTED IN THE AUDITOR'S -- FINDINGS ISSUE IF THIS AUDIT SO MOVES FORWARD I APPRECIATE THE GOVERNOR'S COMMITMENT TO OVERHAULING. AND FIXING THE PROBLEMS AT DMV THE THOUGHT OF REQUESTED ABOUT FILLING OUR DUTY. TO MAKE GOVERNMENT WORK BETTER FOR THE CONSTITUENTS THAT WE ARE ELECTED TO SERVE. AND TO BE A PART OF THE SOLUTION. MANY CALIFORNIANS ARE FRUSTRATED AND ANGRY WITH THE SITUATION. THAT THE DMV AND THEY HAVE EVERY RIGHT TO BE. HAD IT IS THIS COMMITTEE'S ROLE IN PARTICULAR TO PROVIDE OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY WHEN GOVERNMENT IS NOT WORKING FOR THE PEOPLE. THAT IS WHY I AM HERE TODAY PRESENTING THIS REQUEST. TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE JUST THROWING MONEY AT A PROBLEM AND HOPING IT GOES AWAY. I VOTED TO SUPPORT THE BUDGET BILL WITH ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR THE DMV BUT NOT WITHOUT SOME APPREHENSION. AND CONCERN. AND WHILE I DID ALSO BELIEVE VOTE FOR IT. AND WAS PLEASED TO SEE THE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS INCLUDED IN THE BUDGET INDEPENDENT OVERSIGHT IS NECESSARY TO ENSURE. THAT PROBLEMS ARE BEING FIXED. AND TO ASSURE THE PUBLIC THAT WE ARE DOING WHAT IS RIGHT. IN ADDRESSING THE PROBLEM AND NOT SWEEPING IT UNDER THE RUG. ISSUES OF THE DEPARTMENT OF MOTOR VEHICLES HAVE BEEN OF GREAT CONCERN TO ME AND MANY CALIFORNIANS OVER THE PAST YEAR. MEDIA HAS RIGHTFULLY FOCUSED HIS ATTENTION ON THE DMV AND ITS SHORTCOMINGS. AND I'M SURE WE HAVE ALL HEARD FROM CONSTITUENTS REGARDING VARIOUS ISSUES AT THE DMV. THE DMV HAS STRUGGLED IN MANY WAYS OVER THE PAST YEAR. BUT STRUGGLED WITH ISSUING FEDERALLY MANDATED REAL ID'S. WHICH WE WILL NEED -- TO BOARD AN AIRPLANE BEGINNING IN OCTOBER OF TWENTY TWENTY THE DMV ALONG WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY HAVE ALSO STRUGGLED WITH THE DEVELOPMENT. AND DEPLOYING THE MOTOR VOTER PROGRAM. A HUNDRED AND FIVE THOUSAND REGISTRATION ERRORS HAVE BEEN MADE SINCE APRIL. TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND FOR LAST YEAR ESPECIALLY THE DMV STRUGGLED WITH PROVIDING SERVICES TO CALIFORNIANS IN A TIMELY MANNER. TO DEAL WITH THESE ISSUES THE DMV HAS REQUESTED AND THE LEGISLATURE HAS ALLOCATED A LOT OF MONEY WE RECENTLY APPROVED TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY TWO MILLION IN ADDITIONAL FUNDS FOR THE DMV. THAT IS A 17% INCREASE FOR A TOTAL DMV BUDGET OF ONE POINT THREE SIX BILLION DOLLARS. WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT THESE ADDITIONAL FUNDS AS WELL AS THE ENTIRE. ALLOCATION TO DMV IS SPENT IN THE MOST EFFICIENT AND RESPONSIBLE. MANNER POSSIBLE. I REALIZE OTHER REVIEWS HAVE ALREADY TAKEN PLACE REGARDING THE DMV AND TEN TO FOR THIS AUDIT REQUEST TO PICK UP WHERE THE GOVERNOR STRIKE TEAM AND OTHER REPORTS FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. AND ERNEST AND YOUNG LEAVE OFF. I WOULD LIKE TO SEE IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE THAT THE MOST RECENT ACTIONS TAKEN BY THE DMV TO ENSURE THAT OUR REAL IDEAS COMPLY WITH THE FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS. ARE ADEQUATE AND ACCEPTABLE TO THE US DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY. I WOULD LIKE THE STATE AUDITOR LOOK AT THE DMV IS RECENT REQUEST. FOR ACTUAL WERE STRIKING THAT PART BECAUSE WE THAT'S A MOOT POINT. I WOULD LIKE TO THE I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO STATE AUDITOR FORM SOME WORK REGARDING THE MOTOR VOTER PROGRAM. OUR RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE PRIOR REVIEWS BEING IMPLEMENTED. HOW EFFECTIVE IS A TRAINING PROVIDED TO DMV EMPLOYEES? ALSO WOULD LIKE STATE AUDITOR TO REVIEW THE DEPARTMENT TECHNOLOGIES ROLE IN HELPING -- THE DMV DEVELOP IMPLEMENT AND TEST SYSTEMS CONNECTED TO THE MOTOR VOTER PROGRAM. I LIKE TO THINK THE DMV THE PARKING OF TECHNOLOGY FOR BEING HERE TODAY. HOPE CORRECTIVE ACTION IS BEING UNDERTAKEN. ALREADY I BELIEVE A REVIEW BY THE STATE AUDITOR WILL ONLY HELP IN THIS EFFORT. LASTLY I BELIEVE IT IS CRITICAL THAT WE ADDRESS THESE ISSUES AT THE DMV TO PROVIDE CONFIDENCE TO VOTERS. AND DMV CUSTOMERS ALIKE -- MEMBERS SH THE SHORT OF IT IS I BELIEVE THAT THERE'S VALUE IN HAVING AN EXTERNAL AUDIT I THINK WE SHOULD LOOK AT EVERY POSSIBLE RECOMMENDATION INVITE INDEPENDENT LOOK AT WHAT WE CAN DO. WE ARE LOOKING TO BE A PART OF THE SOLUTION MOVING FORWARD AND WITH THAT I'LL RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE IN A DO YOU HAVE OPENING. COMMENTS FROM THANK YOU. MISTER PATTERSON MISTER CHAIRMAN UP. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR IS THIS WORKING. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR IT FOR A THE OPPORTUNITY TO JOINTLY UP UP. UP PRESENT THIS WITH YOU AS PREVIOUSLY STATED -- THIS IS A LEGISLATURE HAS GIVEN ADDITIONAL TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS TO ADDRESS THE CHALLENGES IT REAL ID. IMPLEMENTATION -- A 17% INCREASE. BUT MEMBERS AYE I HAVE BEEN -- SUPPORTIVE OF GOVERNOR NEWSOME'S DMB STRIKE TEAM AS THEY TRIED TO FIX THIS CHRONICALLY MISMANAGED DEPARTMENT. HOWEVER I THINK ALL OF US HAVE. BEEN SO INCLINED WITH THE EXPECTATION THAT THE LEGISLATURE AND THE ADMINISTRATION WOULD ACTUALLY HOLD THE DEPARTMENT ACCOUNTABLE AND WE WOULD SEE. NOT SERIOUS AND QUANTIFIABLE RESULTS. I THINK THE TIME IS LONG PAST DUE THAT THIS STATE AUDITOR SHOULD HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY OF TAKING A GOOD HARD LOOK AT THE KINDS OF CONCERNS WE ALL. HAVE HERE. OTHER CHAIR -- AND I HAVE WORKED TOGETHER TO CRAFT AN AUDIT THAT DOES NOT RECREATE WHAT IS ALREADY BEING DONE BY THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCES REPORT FOR MARCH. INSTEAD WE HAVE PURPOSELY IDENTIFIED WAYS FOR THE STATE AUDITOR TO BE THE MOST EFFECTIVE AND REVIEW INFORMATION THAT WOULD BE THE MOST BENEFIT. NOT ONLY TO THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE BUT ALSO TO THE MEMBERS OF THE GENERAL PUBLIC. THIS -- AS OF THE CHAIR SUGGESTED IT A TWO HUNDRED FORTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS IS IS PART OF THIS REVIEW. WHICH WILL HELP GUIDE THIS LEGISLATURE. NOT IF BUT WHEN. THEY NEXT COME BACK ASKING FOR MORE MONEY [inaudible] NEXT YEAR. THERE IS AN ACCOUNTABILITY EFFORT HERE THAT WE MUST BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN. AND I SUBMIT TO YOU THAT THE MOST INDEPENDENT THE MOST EFFECTIVE AND FAIR APPROACH TO THIS. IS TO HAVE OUR CALIFORNIA'S STATE AUDITOR. BOB BE ENGAGED IN IT. AGAIN THIS AUDIT IS NOT DUPLICATIVE IT IS NOT PREMATURE IN FACT IT IS VERY MUCH PASSED TO DO. THAT IT IS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY THERE'S NO BETTER WAY. OUT WE CAN SEE THIS THEN TAKING A LOOK AT THE ISSUES PRESENTLY WITH OUT REAL ID AND WITH THE MOTOR. VOTER PROGRAM. JUST YESTERDAY WE HAD MORE CONFUSION ABOUT REAL ID. AND WHETHER OR NOT -- THAT CONFUSION. STAMPS TO A MISUNDERSTANDING -- BETWEEN THE GOVERNOR AND OUR OWN ATTORNEY GENERAL WITH RESPECT TO WHETHER OR NOT REAL IDEAS ARE GOING TO BE NECESSARY -- FOR PURCHASE OF AMMUNITION OR NOT -- THERE SEEMS TO BE. CONTINUED A CONFUSION AROUND THE DOCUMENTATION NECESSARY. TO GET THE REAL ID BUT WE HELD WITH THE DM THESE HELP LAST WEEK A WEEK BEFORE -- VERY WELL ATTENDED -- OF WORKSHOPS ON REAL ID. AND EVEN IN THE QUESTION AND ANSWER PERIOD WHERE WE HAD DMV EXPERTS IN THE ROOM. THERE WAS OFTEN A WELL WE'RE NOT SURE ABOUT THAT LET ME GET BACK TO YOU. THERE WERE LOTS OF QUESTIONS FROM PEOPLE I HAVE A MILITARY ID ARE I HAVE OTHER FORMS OF FEDERAL ID. AND SO. I THINK IT IS WE CAN STIPULATE THAT THERE IS SIGNIFICANT CONFUSION. AND I ALSO THINK THAT WE'VE GOT TO TAKE IN AN A LOOK AS WELL. WITH RESPECT -- TO THE PROBLEMS WITH -- WITH MOTOR VOTER -- COME TO FIND OUT THROUGH INVESTIGATIVE JOURNALISM I WANT TO UNDERSCORE THIS. IT HASN'T BEEN BECAUSE WE ASK THE AUDITOR TO LOOK AT THE MOTOR VOTER PROBLEM. OF PEOPLE BASICALLY SUGGEST WELL THERE'S NOT REALLY A PROBLEM HERE LET'S MOVE ON THE REALITY HAS BEEN THROUGH INVESTIGATIVE JOURNALISM. THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY THE DEPARTMENT OF MOTOR VEHICLES. NEW THAT THE MOTOR VOTER PROGRAM WAS NOT READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION. BUT IT WAS PUSHED FORWARD RUSHED FORWARD -- AT THE EXPENSE OF OVER AFFECTING A HUNDRED THOUSAND VOTERS. MEMBERS WE HAVE SEVENTY SEVEN THOUSAND REGISTERED ERRORS FROM SOFTWARE ISSUE. TWENTY THREE THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS BEING INCORRECTLY REGISTERED TO VOTE BECAUSE OF WHAT WAS CALLED AN ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESSING ERROR. AND FIVE THOUSAND TRANSMITTAL ERRORS RIGHT BEFORE A MID TERM ELECTION. MEMBERS I I HAVE HAD CONSTITUENTS NOT ONLY MY DISTRICT BUT UP AND DOWN THE STATE TO HAVE. CALLED MY OFFICE TO TALK TO TO US ABOUT THE CONCERNS THEY'VE HAD OVER THEIR PARTY AFFILIATION BEING CHANGED. OTHERS WHO WERE REGISTERED TO VOTE AFTER THEY HE EVEN OPTED OUT AND OTHERS WERE -- AT WANTED TO VOTE. WERE NOT REGISTERED IN TIME FOR THE ELECTION DUE TO THESE KINDS OF ERRORS. MEMBERS WHEN IT COMES TO REAL ID AND WHEN IT COMES TO MOTOR. VOTER WE HAVE TO HAVE A A PERFECT BATTING AVERAGE. THE YOU KNOW BATTING TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY ONE WE OUGHT TO BE BATTING A THOUSAND IS REALLY IMPORTANT. THIS DEPARTMENT IS THE MOST PUBLIC FACING ENTITY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT TOUCHES MILLIONS UPON MILLIONS OF PEOPLE. PLACING THIS AUDIT. AT THIS TIME IN THE HANDS OF OUR AUDITOR. PROVIDES HUGE RESOURCES AND AND FAIRNESS AND EXPERTISE. THAT QUITE FRANKLY.-WILL INFORM THIS LEGISLATURE AND ALSO WILL HELP US UNDERSTAND WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION SIDE IS DOING WITH RESPECT TO THEIR AUDITS. SO THIS IS NOT ABOUT EITHER FOUR WE THINK THIS IS ABOUT ALL OF US% TOGETHER. FINDING THIS PATHWAY THAT IS GOING TO END UP. CREATING THE TWENTY TH THAT DMV OF THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY. ONE MORE POINT WITH RESPECT -- TO CONCERNS WERE RAISED ABOUT MOTOR VOTER -- MANY OUT. SAID THAT THEN THAT. THERE WAS GOING TO BE SOME ISSUES THAT NON CITIZENS WOULD FACE. INCLUDING LAWFUL RESIDENTS WHO WOULD BE MISTAKENLY REGISTERED TO VOTE AT THE RISK OF THEIR CITIZENSHIP. AT IN AND SO WHAT HAPPENED. ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED IN ELIGIBLE VOTERS INCLUDING NON CITIZENS WERE REGISTERED TO VOTE LAST YEAR BECAUSE OF WHAT QUOTE EIGHT PROCESSING. ERROR WHEN WE REGISTER PEOPLE TO VOTE WE HAVE TO HAVE A 100%. RELIABILITY THERE IS NO -- GRAY AREA WHEN IT COMES TO THE IMPORTANT FRANCHISE OF OF BUILDING TO MAKE SURE ALL PEOPLE ARE ELIGIBLE HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY AND THAT WE HAVE A PROCESS IN WHICH THE REGISTRATION. IS NOT MERELY ACHIEVED IT IS PRECISE AND ACCURATE WE THINK THAT THE AUDITOR WILL HELP US GET TO THAT PLACE. AFTER MONTHS OF MISTAKES WE HAVE THOUSANDS OF EMBARRASSING ERRORS. WE BELIEVE IT IS TIME FOR NONPARTISAN INDEPENDENT AUDIT. FOR THE MOTOR VOTER AND THE REAL ID. BECAUSE IT'S ESSENTIAL FOR THE PEOPLE CALIFORNIA KNOWN UNDERSTAND INCENSED ESSENTIAL FOR US. TO HAVE A TRUST WORTHINESS IN IN WHAT WE ARE. GETTING FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF MOTOR VEHICLES ONE POINT TO ADD ON TO THE CHAIR. WE WE HEARD THE DISCUSSION -- WITH RESPECT TO SEQUENCING. AND WE WE THINK THIS IS A AN AN IMPORTANT AREA WHERE WE MAY BE ABLE. TO HAVE THE AUDIT APPROVED AND YET SEQUENCE IT IN SUCH A WAY THAT WE INCORPORATE. THE EXECUTIVE. RANCHES INFORMATION BOB AND THAT IS THE END THAT WILL. IN MANY WAYS PROBABLY ANSWER SOME QUESTIONS IT WILL PROBABLY REDUCE THE THE TIME AND THE COST NECESSARY AND WILL CERTAINLY. MOVE THE CONCERNED THAT THIS AUDIT YEAH -- IS SOMEHOW DUPLICATIVE AND WITH THAT THE THE CHAIR AND I ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT THANK YOU. WELL BEFORE WE GO TO THE STATE AUDITOR COULD YOU SIMPLY CLARIFY FOR ME THE SEQUENCING ISSUE BECAUSE I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT WHEN WHAT YOU'RE OUT ITS THIRD. SO THAT'S SOMETHING WE WERE TALKING WITH THE OTTER THE ADMINISTRATION IS WE'RE LOOKING AT A POTENTIAL DATE WE WERE UNABLE TO REACH COMPROMISE BUT I WOULD -- TO FOR PROBABLY TO THE AUDITOR ONCE THE ERNST AND YOUNG REPORT COMES OUT AND ALSO ONCE THE STRIKE TURNER TEAM FINISHES ITS REPORT WHICH WERE TOLD SHOULD HAPPEN -- AT THE END OF JULY SO EVEN IF WE DID IMPLEMENTATION DATE OF SAY AUGUST OR SEPTEMBER FIRST -- AND I'M ALSO TOLD THAT THEY ARE IMPLEMENTING SOME OF THOSE CHANGES AS WELL SO THE AUDITOR WOULD. IN FACT HAVE A CHANCE TO LOOK AT AND INFORM. THE RECOMMENDATIONS WHICH ONES ARE BEING EFFECTIVE IF THEY'RE ALREADY. IMPLEMENTING SOME OF THOSE HOW THEY'RE IMPLEMENTING THOSE WHAT WERE ULTIMATELY AIMED AT DOING IS. WE WANT TO BE A PART OF THE SOLUTION WE WANT TO BE A PART OF THE ANSWER. AND WE DON'T WANT TO BE DUPLICATIVE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYTHING THAT THOSE REPORTS ARE IDENTIFYING. THAT WE'RE MOVING FORWARD ON THOSE BECAUSE I THINK EVERY CALIFORNIAN DESERVES -- YOU KNOW A BETTER DMV A BETTER A BETTER OUTCOME A BETTER EXPERIENCE AND SO WE'RE HOPING -- WITH THEY DELAYED IMPLEMENTATION IS WHAT WE'VE ASKED HERE TODAY TO ALLOW THOSE REPORTS TO COME OUT -- SO THAT WE CAN MOVE FORWARD AND FORMED THE PROCESS AND REMOVING QUESTION NUMBER FIVE BECAUSE THAT WAS DONE IN THE BUDGET. THAT IT WILL REDUCE THE COST ACTUALLY OF THE AUDIT -- AS WELL IN THE HOURS REQUIRED -- TO COME UP WITH RECOMMENDATIONS ANOTHER INDEPENDENT LOOK AT THIS SO THAT WE'RE ANALYZING EVERY ANGLE POSSIBLE AN INDEPENDENT FORM. TO SOLVE THESE ISSUES AT DMV. I UNDERSTAND I SO IT'S A FLOATING START DATE WHICH THE AUDITOR GETS TO DETERMINE WHICH IS SORT OF UNUSUAL FOR US TO MONITOR. THANK YOU THANK YOUR CENTER ROTH -- AS AS A MEMBERS INDICATED WE WOULD BE LOOKING AT BOTH REAL ID AND MOTOR VOTER -- A COUPLE OF OBJECTIVES LOOK ASKING US TO IDENTIFY AND EVALUATE CHALLENGES CERTAINLY THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ISSUE REPORT IN MARCH OF TWENTY NINETEEN WE COULD LOOK AT THE THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT THE DEPARTMENT FINANCE MADE -- TO THE DMV AND DETERMINE WHAT THEY WHAT ACTIONS THEY'RE TAKING TO ADDRESS THOSE PARTICULAR RECOMMENDATIONS BUT ALSO IDENTIFY ANY OTHER CHALLENGES -- THAT DMV IS FACING WITH RESPECT TO REAL ID AND AND OUR THE STATE'S EFFORTS TO COMPLY WITH FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS -- BUT ALSO -- THE MEMBERS ARE ASKING US TO LOOK AT NOT JUST WHAT CALIFORNIA DMV IS INTENDING TO DO TO REACH COMPLIANCE WITH FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS. AND AND THE DEADLINE OF OCTOBER FIRST TWENTY TWENTY FOUR REAL ID'S TO BE. YOU KNOW TO THIS FOR THE STATE BE FULLY COMPLIANT AND FOR INDIVIDUALS IN CALIFORNIA HAVE A REAL ID BUT MOVING FORWARD -- IN THE EVENT THERE INDIVIDUALS WHO TAKE LONGER BECAUSE THEY USE OTHER -- IDENTIFICATION NOW WITH RESPECT TO CERTAIN OTHER FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS BUT NOT JUST LOOKING AT CURRENT BUT ALSO WHAT DIEM VIS -- PLANS ARE FOR THE FUTURE TO TO ENSURE CAN CONTINUED COMPLIANCE WITH REAL ID REQUIREMENTS WITH RESPECT TO MOTOR VOTER. AND WE DO UNDERSTAND THAT ERNST AND YOUNG IS CONDUCTING SOME WORK -- ONE OF THE OBJECTIVES IS ASKING US TO SPECIFICALLY LOOK AT THAT REVIEW AGAIN WE WOULD BE INTERESTED IN LOOKING AT THE SCOPE OF WHAT THEY DID THE SUPPORT THEY HAVE FOR ANY CONCLUSIONS THEY REACH WHATEVER RECOMMENDATIONS THEY MAKE -- AND THEN WHAT DMV'S INTENT IS AS FAR AS OR WHAT THEIRPLANS ARE BOTH DMV AND DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY AND MOVING FORWARD TO ADDRESS ANY ISSUES THAT WERE IDENTIFIED IN THERE THE ERNST AND YOUNG REPORT. BUT IN ADDITION TO THAT -- WE WOULD ALSO BE LOOKING AT WHAT TYPES OF TRAINING HAVE BEEN PROVIDED TO DMV EMPLOYEES WITH RESPECT TO MOTOR VOTER ANY FUTURE TRAINING THEY INTEND TO TO PROVIDE -- AND THEN ALSO LOOKING AT DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY AND WHAT THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES AND ROLES WORK ROLE WAS -- IN HELPING DMV DEVELOPED THE PROGRAM AND THE PROCESS IS -- FOR ESTABLISHING DIEM THE MOTOR VOTER AND CERTAIN ELECTRONIC FORMS THERE ARE SPECIFIC FORMS THAT -- DEPARTMENT TECHNOLOGY ASSISTED IN DEVELOPMENT IMPLEMENTATION SO THE MEMBERS ARE ASKING US TO TO SPEND SOME TIME AT DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY AND ADDITIONAL OBJECTIVE IS ASKING US TO LOOK AT CONTROLS OVER THE SYSTEM. TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE APPROPRIATE CONTROLS TO AVOID ANY AUTHOR ON AUTHORIZED ACCESS. TO DMV SYSTEMS -- AND IN THE EVENT THAT THERE HAS BEEN THERE ARE IDENTIFIED SECURITY WEAKNESSES WHAT ACTIONS ARE BEING TAKEN TO SHORE UP THOSE PARTICULAR WEAKNESSES AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER SALAS INDICATED THERE IS ONE OBJECTIVE IN THE AUDIT ANALYSIS. THAT CORRESPONDS TO THE THE NUMBER IN HIS LETTER WOULD BE OBJECTIVE NINE WHERE WE WERE BEING ASKED TO LOOK AT THE REQUEST THAT -- DMV HAD SUBMITTED. RIGHT TO THE LEGISLATURE FOR APPROVAL SINCE THAT. GIVES ME HAS BEEN APPROVED WE WOULD TAKE THAT OBJECTIVE OUT NOT NEED TO DO THAT WORK. SKEWS ME -- AND THAT WOULD SAVE SOME TIME WOULD SAVE A LITTLE OVER A HUNDRED HOURS BECAUSE WE FELT THAT LOOKING AT THE THE B. C. P. AND THEIR UNDERLYING SUPPORT WOULDN'T TAKE OUR STAFF A LOT OF TIME AND THEN CERTAINLY SUPERISOR REVIEW. SO THE HOURS WOULD BE REDUCED AGAIN CENTER ROTH SIMILAR TO YOUR QUESTION ON ON THAT PREVIOUS AUDIT REQUEST TO THE EXTENT WE CAN RELY ON ANY WORK THAT ERNST AND YOUNG HAS BEEN DONE AT THE HAS BEEN DONE BY ERNST AND YOUNG. AND HAS BEEN DONE BY DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WE WOULD CERTAINLY DO THAT. BUT THE FOCUS TO THIS PARTICULAR AUDIT IS OKAY ISSUES HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED WHAT ACTIONS ARE DMB AND OR DEPARTMENT TECHNOLOGY TAKING A TO ADDRESS THOSE CONCERNS. THANK YOU AFFECTED AGENCY ANYONE HERE. FROM D. M. V. [inaudible] ANYONE ELSE. COME ON DOWN IDENTIFY YOURSELF FOR THE RECORD PLEASE. GOOD MORNING CHAIR AND MEMBERS I AM KATHLEEN WEB I AM THE ACTING DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT OF MOTOR VEHICLES WITH ME TODAY. IS WEST COOPED UP THE DIRECTOR OF LICENSING OPERATIONS DIVISION I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO MEET WITH YOU. PROVIDE A STATUS ON DMV'S EFFORT SUPPORTING THE REAL IDEA MOTOR VOTER PROGRAMS FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS. TV HAS MADE A COMMITMENT CONTINUES TO WORK WITH THE SECRETARY OF STATE. THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE TO IMPLEMENT CORRECTIVE ACTIONS AND ENHANCEMENTS. TO APPROVE PERFORMANCE OF BOTH A REAL ID AND THE MOTOR VOTER PROGRAMS. IN MARCH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE OF THE DEPARTMENT FINANCE OFFICE THE STATE OUGHT SENATE VALUATIONS. COMPLETED AN AUDIT OF THE DMV AND UNDERTOOK THE FOLLOWING. ASSESS THE EFFICIENCY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF DMV'S CURRENT OPERATIONS AND MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS TO IMPROVE ITS PRACTICES. AND ENHANCE THE FIELD OFFICE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE AND EVALUATE DMV'S INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEM AND ITS IMPACT ON THE FIELD OFFICE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE. DMV IS RESPONDED TO THE ART OF FUNDING THROUGH A CORRECTIVE ACTION PLAN IT PROVIDED TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AT THE END OF MAY. THE PLAN OR THE CAP IS IT'S REFER TO CONTINUES A PROCESS OF OVERSIGHT AND EVALUATION. ON HOW DMV WILL DRESSING CORRECT ALMOST ONE HUNDRED INDIVIDUAL AREAS IDENTIFIED BY THE AUDITOR'S FOR IMPROVEMENT. ADDITIONALLY THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCES OVERSEEING AN INDEPENDENT ASSESSMENT OF THE DMV'S MOTOR VOTER PROGRAM BY ERNST AND YOUNG. THE RESULTS OF THIS INDEPENDENT REVIEW IS EXPECTED TO BE COMPLETED IN JULY. TV ALSO CONTINUES TO WORK WITH THE STRIKE TEAM OF FINDING ADDITIONAL IMPROVEMENTS. DESTRY MY OUR OPERATIONS IMPROVE OUR CUSTOMERS EXPERIENCE AND MODERNIZE THE DMV. ADDITIONALLY SINCE LAST AUGUST DMV'S PROVIDE A MONTHLY REPORTS TO THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BUDGET COMMITTEE. ON ITS WAIT TIMES ANOTHER OPERATIONAL IMPROVEMENTS TO BETTER SERVE OUR CUSTOMERS. THE REPORT PROVIDES COMPREHENSIVE DATE ON EACH FIELD OFFICE AND PROVIDES INFORMATION OF PREVIOUS AN UPCOMING MILESTONES. FURTHER THE TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY TWENTY BUDGET WILL REQUIRE ADDITIONAL PERFORMANCE METRICS REPORTING. TO ENSURE THAT FUNDING IS BEING SPENT APPROPRIATELY. WE ARE FULLY COMMITTED TO MAKING THE DMV BETTER AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THE COMMITTEE MAY HAVE [inaudible] MEMBERS QUESTIONS [inaudible] SIR MONEY. THANK YOU MISTER VICE CHAIR I WANT TO THANK THE MEMBERS FOR MOVING THIS FORWARD -- ALTHOUGH I DO HAVE SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT TIMING IN. NEED SO I GUESS A QUESTION. FOR IN FROM DEPARTMENT DIRECTOR THANK YOU FOR STEPPING UP IN. HOW DO YOU ASSESS THE? CORRECTIVE ACTION PLAN FROM DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ON IT IN% THE ON GOING PARENTS TEN YOUNG. DO YOU THINK THOSE ARE COMPREHENSIVE IN PROVIDING. DIRECTION HIGHLIGHTED AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT. SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE TOOK UPON OURSELVES WHEN WE ARE ALSO SUBMITTING OUR BUDGET REQUEST ALL OF YOU IS TO DEVELOP A COMPREHENSIVE WORK PLAN. AND IN THE HOT COMPREHENSIVE WORK PLAN WE HAVE IDENTIFIED WHEN I CALL KIND OF A WORKING SCHEDULE. TO ADDRESS ALL THE THINGS THAT WE NEED TO DELIVER -- I AM A FIRM BELIEVER OF BEING KIND OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT -- ELK AND ALSO ABOUT PERFORMANCE MUCH MANAGEMENT. IS THAT IF YOU DON'T ACTUALLY DOCUMENT YOU DON'T MEASURE IT OFTENTIMES DOESN'T GET DONE. AND SO IT WAS REALLY CLEAR TO ME TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CLEARLY IDENTIFY ALL THAT NEED TO BE DONE THE MILESTONES. DEVELOP TIMELINES -- BE ABLE TO ALSO MAKE APPROPRIATE COURSE CORRECTIONS IF WE DETERMINE THE PATH WE WERE TAKING WAS NOT THE RIGHT PATH. THOSE ARE ALL IMPORTANT IN MAKING GOOD DECISIONS SO I FEEL BETWEEN THE CORRECTIVE ACTION PLAN. THE WORK PLAN AND THEN -- DETERMINING WHAT THE ASSESSMENT IS FROM ERNST AND YOUNG -- WILL HAVE A GOOD HANDLE ON THINGS WE NEED TO DO. THAT BEING SAID I DON'T DISMISS THE VALUE OF AN AUDIT I AM A KIND OF A CHAMPION FOR AUDITS AND APPRECIATE THE VALUE. I THINK THE TIMING OF IT IS PROBABLY WHAT'S MOST IMPORTANT. IS IMPORTANT FOR US TO AT LEAST ALLOW THE TIME TO IMPLEMENT WHAT WE STARTEDTO ACTUALLY SEE THAT THERE'S BEEN SOME MARKET IMPROVEMENTS I WOULD TELL YOU SAID SHE JUST APPROVE THE BUDGET. WE HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE EVEN IMPLEMENT SOME OF THE THINGS THAT YOU'VE ALLOWED US TO GO AHEAD AND IMPLEMENT -- AND THEN THE SO YOUNG ASSESSMENT IS GOING TO BE INTERESTING BUT I WILL ASSURE YOU. THAT ON A WEEKLY BASIS WE ARE A CONSTANT CONVERSATION WITH THE SECRETARY OF STATE WITH REGARDS TO THE PROGRAMMATIC ASPECTS OF MOTOR VOTER -- AND IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT. THE DEPARTMENT OF MOTOR VEHICLES SERVES AS AN ADMINISTRATOR FOR THE SECRETARY OF STATE. WE PROCESS THE INFORMATION MAKING THE DETERMINATION ON THOSE THAT ARE ELIGIBLE TO VOTE IN REGISTERING IN THE ROLES THAT STILL LIES WITH THE SECRETARY OF STATE. SO I THINK THAT'S ALSO PART WHEN YOU CONSIDER WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO BE EVALUATING. THANK YOU FROM. THE THE THE PROPOSED BUDGET ALLOCATION FOR NINETEEN TWENTY DOES THAT PROVIDE YOU SUFFICIENT RESOURCES TO IMPLEMENT YEAR STRATEGIC. WORK PLAN. AT THIS POINT TIME BASED ON OUR ASSESSMENT AND TRYING TO ALSO BE EXTREMELY GOOD STEWARDS OF THE MONEY SO THE CALIFORNIANS WE BELIEVE IT DOES -- I THINK WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE VOLUME OF CALIFORNIANS THAT DO HAVE DRIVER'S LICENSE AND IDENTIFICATIONS AND THEY ONE OF THE LARGEST STATES TO GO AHEAD AND UNDERTAKE THIS OFFER -- IT IS A SIGNIFICANT AND I THINK AS I SAID EARLIER IT'S A STARK AN UNPRECEDENTED FOR THE CALIFORNIA FOR THE DMV. BUT I DO BELIEVE WE HAVE THE RESOURCES I THINK MORE IMPORTANTLY IT'S NOT JUST ONE SET OF THINGS WERE LOOKING OUT TO IMPROVE IT. IT'S HOW DO WE USE OUR WEBSITE IN A MORE EFFICIENT WAY IT'S HOW DO WE DEPLOY MORE CHAOS SO THAT WE CAN SERVE MORE PEOPLE THROUGH THE VEHICLE REGISTRATION PROCESS. HOW DO WE CREATE MORE CAPACITY THAN IN OUR FIELD OFFICES TO HANDLE THE DRIVER'S LICENSE AND IDENTIFICATION? PROCESSING THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE SO I THINK AT THIS POINT TIME WE FEEL CONFIDENT BUT I ALSO KNOW WILL BE REPORTING TO YOU ON A REGULAR BASIS. AND THE FUNDING YOU'VE GIVEN US IS FOR A TWO YEAR PERIOD OF TIME SO WE'LL BE ABLE TO GET IN. CONTINUE TO ASSESS HOW WE ARE APPROPRIATELY FORECASTED WHAT WE NEED HELP WE ARE PROBABLY FORECAST AT THE DEMAND -- AND HAVE WE ANTICIPATED THE POSITIVE RESULTS FROM THE OTHER THINGS THAT WE THINK WE'RE GOING TO BE DOING. TO HELP ADDRESS CUSTOMER NEEDS. THANK YOU -- SO [inaudible] AND YOU'VE SUGGESTED A WILLINGNESS TO COOPERATE SHOULD THERE BE A STATE ON IT BUT GIVEN WHAT YOU ARE SEEKING TO IMPLEMENT RIGHT NOW -- THE TIMING OF THAT ON IT I THINK YOU ALLUDED TO IT BUT WHAT IT DIVERT INTERNAL RESOURCES THAT WOULD IMPEDE YOUR ABILITY TO ACHIEVE. CURRENTLY IDENTIFIED OBJECTIVES. WELL I THINK -- I CAN ASSURE YOU IN MY SHORT TENURE AT DMV -- WITH A NUMBER OF AUDIT SICK IT DONE ON THE DMV I AM CONSTANTLY DIVERTING RESOURCES. TO SUPPORT THE AUDIT ACTIVITY -- THAT JUST COMES WITH THE TERRITORY SO BUT I CAN'T TELL YOU WHAT THE RESOURCES WOULD BE BECAUSE THAT WOULD DEPEND ON THE SCOPE OF THE AUDIT. BUT THERE WOULD BE A DIVERSION OF RESOURCES TO SUPPORT THE AUDIT ACTIVITY. INTO ASKED THAT ANOTHER WAY -- WOULD IT BE MORE USEFUL. TO SERVING THE PUBLIC INTEREST. TO HAVE AN AUDIT THAT CAME. LATER AFTER THE RETURN OF THE ERNST AND YOUNG ON IT IN YOUR ABILITY TO PURSUE SOME OF THE CURRENTLY STATED A REFORM SENATE CHECKED OF STATE YOU'RE WORKING ON I WOULD APPRECIATE THAT -- I I THINK IT WOULD ALLOW US TIME. TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE CITY YOUNG FOLKS HAVE IDENTIFIED AS SOME IMPROVEMENTS THAT COULD BE MADE -- AND AGAIN IT'S IT'S THROUGH A PARTNERSHIP WITH THE SECRETARY OF STATE THAT WE'D BE LOOKING AT IMPROVEMENTS THAT COULD BE MADE -- BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT NOT TO MAYBE -- OVER AUDIT OR OVER ANALYZED -- TO I THINK WE NEED ALLOW SOME THINGS TO HAPPEN IN TO MATERIALIZE TO LET US UNDERSTAND WHAT IT MEANS FOR US. I THINK PROGRAM MEDICALLY THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE VESTED IN DMV DOING REALLY REALLY WELL -- INCLUDING MYSELF IN THE GOVERNOR ON THE GOVERNOR'S STRIKE TEAM. AND I THINK WE LIKE A CHANCE TO REALLY TRULY IMPLEMENT SOME OF THESE THINGS WE BELIEVE WILL MAKE A DIFFERENCE BUT I CERTAINLY DON'T DISMISS. THE REQUESTED I THINK I'M. AS YOU'VE ALL POINTED OUT WE TOUCH MORE CALIFORNIANS THAN ALMOST ANY OTHER DEPARTMENT -- AND WE TAKE THAT RESPONSIBILITY VERY SERIOUSLY BUT I ALSO APPRECIATE -- DOING AUDITS TO CHECK THE INTEGRITY OF OUR SYSTEM AND HOW WE'RE DELIVERING I THINK THAT'S A GREAT MEASUREMENT FOR THE DMV AS WELL. BUT I REALLY WOULD APPRECIATE US THINKING ABOUT THE TIMING OF IT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR IF I MAY YES PLAN -- AND THAT'S WHY WE WERE TRYING TO NEGOTIATED DELAYED IMPLEMENTATION SO THAT WE HAVE THE RIVER. THE ANSWERS FROM NOT ONLY THERE TO SEND YOUNG REPORT BUT EVEN THE STRIKE FORCE TEAM YOU KNOW SO I APPLAUD THEIR EFFORTS IN DOING THAT BUT WE DON'T WANT TO BE DUPLICATIVE OF THAT BUT WANTED TO ALLOW THE AUDITOR TO COME IN. ONCE WE RECEIVE THOSE AND THAT WAS WHY WE WERE PUSHING FOR A DELAYED IMPLEMENTATION SO WE CAN INCORPORATE THOSE -- MOVING FORWARD AS WELL THANK YOU AND I APPRECIATE THAT CLARIFICATION. I HAVE NO FURTHER QUESTIONS RIGHT NOW MISTER CHAIR THANK CENTER. COLLEAGUES FOR THE QUESTIONS. MOVE THE MOVE THE AUDIT. FOR A SECOND. LET ME -- LET ME MAKE A COMMENT HERE -- FIRST I WANT TO COMMEND THE AUTHORS -- THERE COULD BE. TWO NO FINER AUTHORS FOR THIS PARTICULAR REQUEST -- AND I WANT TO SAY THAT I CERTAINLY VALUE EXTERNAL AUDIT CERTAINLY BY OUR SUPERB STATE AUDITOR. WHO DOES AN OUTSTANDING JOB IN FACT THE LAST TIME THIS MATTER CAME BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE -- I VOTED FOR IT. NOW IT DIDN'T MAKE IT THROUGH THE HOOP -- BUT SINCE THAT TIME -- THE THE CALIFORNIA OFFICE OF STATE AUDITS CONDUCTED IS HAS BEEN REFERENCED -- ON AUDIT OF THE DMV AND ISSUED A REPORT. TOWARD THE END OF MARCH OF TWO THOUSAND AND NINETEEN AND WHAT WE FOUND WAS THIS IS NO SIMPLE MATTER HERE IN THE DMV THE ISSUE IS A VERY VERY COMPLEX. WE HAVE IT ISSUES BOTH IN TERMS OF THE SYSTEM WE HAVE STAFFING ISSUES IN TERMS OF NUMBERS OF PEOPLE IN THE TRAINING PROVIDED. WE HAD SIGNIFICANT LONG STANDING FUNING ISSUES. I IN THE DMV PROVIDING THE DMV WITH ENOUGH MONEY. TO DO THE VERY VERY IMPORTANT. JOB IS THAT WE OF TEST DMV WOULD DOING BOTH AT THE STATE LEVEL ON THE FEDERAL LEVEL. AND WE CERTAINLY IDENTIFIED PUBLIC COMMUNICATION ISSUES IN TERMS OF WHAT'S REQUIRED FOR ALMOST ANYTHING AND HOW TO GET THAT INFORMATION OUT OR WHETHER WE HAVE THE SYSTEMS. INSIDE THE DMV AND OUTSIDE TO FOR TO PUSH THAT INFORMATION OUT WELL. WE STARTED WORKING ON THOSE AS YOU ALL KNOW AND IT'S BEEN REFERENCED WE'VE APPROPRIATED SEVERAL HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS -- IN LONG OVERDUE FUNDING FOR THE D. M. V. TO START. WORKING THESE ISSUES WHETHER IT'S I. T. UPGRADES FOR HIRING AND TRAINING THE RIGHT THE RIGHT PEOPLE TO DO THE JOB. OF THE GOVERNOR DESIGNATED A STRIKE TEAM -- WITH THE HEAD. OF THE SECRETARY OFOF GOV OPS -- WHO IS -- ABSOLUTELY THE MOST OUTSTANDING PUBLIC SERVANT I THINK I'VE EVER HAD THE PLEASURE. OF THE WORKING WITHIN. IN THIRTY TWO YEARS OF MILITARY SERVICE AND ALL OF THE REST OF THE TIME THAT I'VE PUT IN IN AND OUT OF THE SERVICE. WE HAVE AN ERNST AND YOUNG OF STUDY THAT'S GOING ON THAT'S BEEN REFERENCED IT'LL BE ISSUED IN. HOPEFULLY A FEW MONTHS -- TO DEAL WITH SOME MORE OF THESE -- MORE OF THESE PROBLEMS. AND IDENTIFY SOLUTIONS. SO AT THIS POINT WHILE I CERTAINLY VALUE AN EXTERNAL WATER THAN I THINK AT SOME POINT IN TIME WE DO NEED -- TO AUTHORIZE AND APPROVE. AN AUDIT BY OUR STATE AUDITOR TO GO IN AND SEE WHAT THE FIXES ARE THAT HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED AND WHETHER THOSE HAVE BEEN WORKING I'M NOT SURE FRANKLY THAT THIS IS. THE RIGHT TIME TO DO SO FROM A PERSONAL PERSPECTIVE I THINK WE NEED TO LET THIS PROCESS CONTINUE WE NEED TO LET THE ERNST AND YOUNG REPORT SURFACE. WIENER WINDOW AT THE STRIKE TEAM WORKS THROUGH THE LIST OF RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WERE IDENTIFIED BURKE CALIFORNIA OFFICE OF STATE AUDITS. AND ADDRESS THOSE THAT I HOPE WERE FORTHCOMING AS PART OF THE YEAR AND JUSTIN YOUNG. OF AUDIT. AND ALLOW THOSE IMPLEMENTATIONS TO OCCUR. HOPEFULLY SUCCESSFULLY BEFORE WE LAUNCH THE STATE HONOR IN THERE SO THAT WHEN WE DO LAUNCH THE STATE AUDITOR. ON OF FORAY INTO THE DMV TO THE TUNE OF ALMOST FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS. THAT THE STATE AUDITOR HAS SOMETHING NEW TO LOOK AT SO THAT WHEN SHE ISSUES A REPORT SHE ISSUES OF REPORT BASED ON THE CHANGES THE SOLUTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED THE CHANGES THAT HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED. TO TELL US IN FACT WHETHER THOSE WORK OR NOT SO I JUST WANTED TO PUT. A MY POSITION ON THE RECORD TO COMMAND THE REQUEST YEARS -- AT FOR THEIR EFFORTS AND INDICATE THAT -- I CERTAINLY WILL BE SUPPORTIVE AT SOME POINT IN THE FUTURE OF AN AUDIT OF OUR DMV. pI'M NOT GONNA BE JUST BE ABLE TO SUPPORT IT. TO TODAY. SO HAVING SAID THAT PUBLIC COMMENT ON THIS ISSUE SEEING NONE [inaudible] CENTER. YES -- CAN I TO I DON'T WANT TO SURPRISE ANYONE SO I YOU KNOW AFTER REVIEWING -- ALL THE INFORMATION AS WELL -- I TO WILL BE OF THE SAME SENTIMENT OF SENATOR ROTH -- IT. I KNOW THAT YOUR BRAND NEW IN YOUR COMING IN HERE I'M BRAND NEW AS WELL AND I KNOW HOW DIFFICULT IT MAY BE ON YOU WHEN THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF ATTENTION AND I JUST TRUST THAT WE ARE DOING AND PUTTING THE RIGHT PROCEDURES IN PLACE TO ENSURE THAT. WE'RE GETTING ENOUGH INFORMATION FIRST AND FOREMOST BEFORE WE BEGIN ANOTHER AUDIT -- AND IN REFERENCE TO THE FIFTEEN HUNDRED OR SO NON ELIGIBLE PERSONS THAT MAY BE UNDOCUMENTED TO VOTE. THERE WAS NO MMHM -- MENTION HERE OF WORK WITH SECRETARY OF STATE AND SO I THINK THAT IF THAT IS AN ISSUE THAT PERHAPS. THAT COULD BE ADDRESSED ON THE ROAD AS WELL -- SO WITH THAT. THAT'S WHERE I STAND AT THIS POINT. COLLEAGUES IT'S BEEN MOVED AND SECONDED OF LET'S CALL THE ROLL. IF I MAY CLOSE YOU CERTAINLY MAY I APOLOGIZE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- AND I APPRECIATE THE DIALOGUE HERE TODAY AND I APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS FROM BY THE VICE CHAIR AS WELL. AND MOVING FORWARD YOU KNOW IT. AT THE END OF THE DAY WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS CRAFTED MODERATE. THAT WOULD BE RESPECTIVE OF THE WORK THAT'S BEING DONE BY THE ADMINISTRATION BY THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE A STRIKE TEAM -- GOVERNMENT OPS AN EARNEST YOUNG -- WHICH IS WHY WE TRY TO COME TO THIS COMPROMISE OF PERHAPS A DELAYED IMPLEMENTATION ONE DAUGHTER WOULD GO IN -- MY IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT SOME OF THOSE -- RECOMMENDATIONS ACTUALLY BEING -- MOVED ON NOW. SO. I BELIEVE AUDITOR WOULD HAVE -- SOME MATERIAL ACTUALLY REVIEW -- WITH THAT I JUST THINK IT'S INTUITIVE ON ALL OF US TO USE ALL THE RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO US AT THE STATE. TO TRY TO COME UP WITH THE RECOMMENDATIONS TO HELP SOLVE THE ISSUES AT DMV I BELIEVE THE AUDITOR CAN PROVIDE SOME OF THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS WITH AN IN DEPTH LOOK. AT HOW WE GET TO IMPROVING DMV FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS. RIGHT WE KNOW THAT THERE'S BEEN DOCUMENTED INSTANCES THAT I'VE BEEN. ACROSS NUMEROUS HEADLINES AND A NUMBER OF NEWS REPORTS -- WE HEAR IT ANECDOTALLY FROM OUR CONSTITUENTS BACK HOME -- YOU KNOW EVEN FOR FAMILY MEMBERS WHO HAVE TOLD ME THEY WAITED IN LINE FOR OVER EIGHT HOURS. WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS WE WANT TO TRY TO FIX DMV FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS WE THINK THE ODD IT HELPS? DO THAT MOVES US IN THAT DIRECTION WE SEE THIS AS BEING A PART OF THE SOLUTION NOT A HURDLE. IN ANY SENSE OF THE WORD BUT SOMETHING THAT WE CAN DO COLLECTIVELY WITH ALL OUR STATE RESOURCES TO TRY TO IMPROVE IN AND MAKE A DIFFERENCE. AND WITH THAT I THINK -- MISTER PATTERSON HAD ADDITIONAL COMMENTS I'D APPRECIATE THAT WANT TO REITERATE THAT THE MANNER IN WHICH WE ARE APPROACHING THIS. IS TO PRECISELY DELAY THIS TO THE OPPORTUNITY TO SEE THE ERNST AND YOUNG AUDIT. TO COME FORWARD A MAYBE THAT'S JULY OR AUGUST. SOONER OR LATER I THINK WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO HAVE THE ARE INDEPENDENT EYES OF THE STATE AUDITOR ON THIS. AND I AM NOT I DON'T REALLY WANT TO IN INTER UP POLITICAL KINDS OF THINGS BUT LET'S UNDERSTAND WE HAVE A SEPARATE SEPARATION OF POWERS. AND THERE IS THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH THERE'S THE TO LET JUST LET LEGISLATIVE -- SENATE. AND ASSEMBLY AND THERE IS. INHERENT IN THAT. A DEGREE OF OF CONFLICT WHAT WE HAVE IN OUR STATE AUDITOR. IS AN INDEPENDENT. NONPARTISAN. HIGHLY SKILLED WITH A STAFF THAT HAS REPEATEDLY COME FORWARD WITH AUDITS THAT HAVE BEEN -- REVELATIONS POINTING AND DIRECTIONS -- THAT WE DIDN'T EVEN KNOW ABOUT THAT EVEN -- SURPRISED -- THAT THE INSTITUTIONS OF THE WORK THAT. ASSEMBLY TO THE AUDIT. IT IS THE IMPORTANCE IT SEEMS TO ME. TO HAVE AT THE TABLE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE [inaudible] AN INDEPENDENT. A HIGHLY REGARDED [inaudible] A PROFESSIONAL. IT IS ALSO. OF MY EXPERIENCE IN -- EIGHT YEARS BEING A MAYOR FRESNO THAT WITHOUT AUDITS YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT'S GOING ON EVEN THOUGH YOU ARE AT THE EXECUTIVE OF THE CITY AND SO WE HAD. LOTS OF STAFF AUDITOR'S IT HAD TO DO THIS KIND OF KIND OF WORK. THAT AGAIN ARE. ASKING THOSE WHO ARE CONSIDERING -- NOT VOTING ON THIS OUGHT TO RECOGNIZE THAT WHAT WE ARE DOING HERE IS PRECISELY WHAT YOU'RE ASKING WHICH IS. SPUR SPACE THIS AWHILE WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS LET'S NOT STE. THAT'S NOT DO NOTHING. LET'S HAVE THAT INFORMATION COME. SEQUENCE AT THE WAY WE HAVE THAT DECIDED EARLIER ON ON A ON A DIFFERENT AUDIT. AND ALLOW THE AUDITOR TO TAKE A LOOK AND THEN. MOVE FORWARD. UP HAVING SAID THAT. I ACTUALLY THINK THAT. THERE'S GONNA BE A HIGH PROBABILITY THAT THAT OVER TIME WE WILL CONTINUE UNFORTUNATELY TO SEE. OUR PROBLEMS AND I THINK SOONER OR LATER. GIVEN A PERIOD OF TIME. IT WOULD BE HELPFUL. NOT IN A HINDRANCE NOT DUPLICATION BUT HELPFUL. TO HAVE A LANE HOUSE EYES ON THIS AS WELL SO I I I SUSPECT THERE WILL BE OTHER MEMBERS COMING FORWARD UP WITH OTHER AUDIT. IT'S SIMILAR AUDIT REQUESTS AS WE MOVE FORWARD AND AT SOME POINT I HOPE THOSE THAT ARE READY. TO MOVE THIS ONE FOUR WOULD WOULD BE WILLING TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE NEXT ONE THAT WE BRING FORWARD. WITH POP FOR THAT FOR THESE REASONS I ASK FOR YOUR AYE BOAT. THANK YOU GERMAN OF PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. THE MOTION IS TO APPROVE WATER REQUEST NUMBER TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN DASH.

OKAY AT THIS TIME WE'RE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND MOVE TO AGENDA ITEM. NUMBER SEVEN THIS IS TWO ZERO ONE NINE DASH ONE ONE SIX JUVENILE JUSTICE CRIME PREVENTION ACT FUNDS BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER JONES SAWYER. ASSEMBLY MEMBER REGINALD BYRON JONES SAWYER SENIOR YOU MAY PROCEED -- WHEN YOU ARE READY? OKAY -- GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS. I AM RECESS I AM RESPECTFULLY REQUESTING THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE AUDIT COMMITTEE TO APPROVE AN AUDIT TO EVALUATE TO SPENDING. DECISION MAKING REPORTING AND EVALUATION OF JUVENILE JUSTICE CRIME PREVENTION ACT JJ CPA FUNDS. IN TWO THOUSAND THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE PASSED THE SHIFT CARD IN THIS CRIME PREVENTION ACT WHICH AUTHORIZE NON COMPETITIVE FUNDING FOR COUNTIES TO SUPPORT PROGRAMS TO REDUCE YOUTH. CRIME THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE ALSO ASSIGNED A BOARD OF STATE AND COMMUNITY CORRECTION BSE SEE AT THE FUND ADMINISTRATOR ADMINISTRATOR. A TWO THOUSAND ONE SENATE BILL EXTENDED THE FUNDING AND CHANGE ITS NAME TO THE JUVENILE JUSTICE CRIME PREVENTION ACT J. J. C. P. A THIS WAS ESTABLISHED TO PROVIDE A STABLE FUNDING SOURCE FOR PROGRAMS. PROVEN TO REDUCE CRIME AND DELINQUENCY AMONG WHAT I CALL AT PROMISE YOUTH. THE MANAGEMENT OF THE FUND SHOULD BE BASED ON IMPLEMENTING LANGUAGE COLLABORATIVE AND INCLUSIVE OF THE COMMUNITY. FURTHER PROOF OF COMMUNITY FOCUSED INTENT IS THE REDEFINITION OF FRONTLINE LAW ENFORCEMENT TO INCLUDE COMMUNITY CRIME PREVENTION AND JUSTICE JUVENILE JUSTICE PROGRAM. DJJ C. P. A PROGRAM. HAS PROVIDED GRANTS TOTALING APPROXIMATELY A HUNDRED MILLION. EACH YEAR FOR COUNTY TO SUPPORT YOUTH IN THE COMMUNITY THROUGH AN ARRAY OF INTERVENTION AND PREVENTION PROGRAMS. EXCUSE ME MY CONCERN IN A REASON FOR THIS AUDIT IS TO ENSURE THAT THESE FUNDS ARE USED APPROPRIATELY TO PROVIDE THE RETURN ON INVESTMENT R. O. Y. DE CALIFORNIA JUST BACK WHEN FUNDING THESE PROGRAMS. IN PARTICULAR HAVE CONCERNS THAT COUNTIES ARE OUT OF COMPLIANCE WITH DECISION MAKING PROCESS IS MANDATED BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. JJ CPA REQUIRES COUNTIES TO CREATE A JUVENILE JUSTICE COORDINATING COUNCIL THAT COLLABORATIVELY DEVELOP JJ CPAP SPENDING PLANS WITHIN GRAZIER FROM COUNTY DEPARTMENTS COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND THE COMMUNITY. AT LARGE GET A NUMBER OF COUNTIES HAVE LEFT MANDATED MEMBER SEATS VACANT FOR YEARS AND THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT SOME COUNTIES ARE NOT ENGAGING IN COLLABORATIVE REALLY OR UPDATING THE REQUIRED SPENDING PLANS TO KEEP UP WITH THE NEEDS OF YOUTH. CURRENT SPENDING PRACTICES MUST BE INVESTIGATED TO NOT ONLY ACCOUNT FOR POOR ALLOCATION DECISIONS BUT ALSO POTENTIAL UNDER SPENDING OF JJ CPA FUNDS FOR EXAMPLE. THE LOCAL AUDIT OF LOS ANGELES COUNTY FOUND THAT BY DECEMBER OF TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN TWENTY SEVEN MILLION IN UNSPENT J. J. C. P. FUNDS. HAD BEEN ALLOCATED AND LITTLE EVIDENCE EXISTED TO SHOW ANY OF THE SPENDING WAS EFFECTIVE IN REDUCING RECIDIVISM A RIP. IMPROVING YOUTH OUTCOMES MOREOVER EXISTING COUNTY REPORTING PRACTICES MAKE IT EXTREMELY DIFFICULT FOR COUNTY AGENCIES ELECTED OFFICIALS ARE MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC. TO EVALUATE HOW EFFECTIVELY JJ CPA. DOLLARS ARE BEING INVESTED OVER A HUNDRED MILLION IN STATE FUNDS HAVE BEEN ALLOCATED TO COUNTIES ANNUALLY WITHOUT ADEQUATE REPORTING TRANSPARENCY OVERSIGHT FOR NEARLY TWO DECADES. THIS PROVOKEDAUDIT WOULD NOT ONLY INSURE POLICYMAKERS AND MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC HAVE AN ACCURATE UNDERSTANDING OF HOW THE STATE DOLLARS ARE BEING ALLOCATED TO MANAGE EACH YEAR BUT ALSO INSURANCE INVESTMENT LOCAL SERVICES THAT MEET THE DID. THE DIVERSE NEEDS OF OUR STATE YOU. MEMBERS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR OPENING WE WILL MOVE TO YOUR WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. GOOD AFTERNOON THE PHONE IF YOU STATE YOUR NAME. FOR THE RECORD AT LEAST ONCE MADE THEM WITH THE YOU'VE JUST COALITION. OKAY -- HE'S -- IN LA COUNTY WE ORGANIZE TO IN THAT JJ CPA FUNDED VOLUNTARY PROP BRIGHT PROBATION PROGRAM I SAY VOLUNTARY WITH -- PARENTHESES AROUND IT BECAUSE THAT MANY YOUTH AND FAMILIES WERE GIVEN MUCH CHOICE. WHETHER OR NOT TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS PROGRAM. THOUSAND YOUTH EACH EACH YEAR ARE SUPERVISED. BY PROBATION OFFICERS EVEN THOUGH THEY HAD NEVER BEEN ARRESTED. 81% ARE SUPERVISED BY. PROBATION OFFICERS FOR ACADEMIC REASONS SUCH AS LOW GRADES ARE A ABSENCES -- I'M WHAT I WITNESSES PROGRAM IN SCHOOL -- WHEN MY FORMAL PROBATION OFFICER? TOLD ME THAT I HAD TO REPORTS OF MY ON CAMPUS PROBATION OFFICER -- BACKGROUND WITH THE COMPTON HIGH. AND I CALLED AND I WE AT THIS -- BUNGALOW AND THE BUNGALOW -- IS WHAT IT TO POLICE. THE SCHOOL PLEASE WHERE -- SO I ALSO SYSTEMS OF VOLUNTEER PROBATION BEAR WITH ME SO. SO THE PREVENTION OF HIS WAS PUT INSIDE BUT SO THE PROBATION OFFICE WAS PUT IN FACT POLICE BUNGALOW SINCE I WAS A FORMER PROBATION EVERY DAY. FOR DURING MY FORTY FIVE MINUTE LUNCH BREAK I HAD TO WALK POLICE TO WALK TO THE POLICE VOTED. AT A YOUNG AGE I WAS -- SORRY I'M I'M I'M I'M ALL OVER THE PLACE WITH MY WITH MY NOTES OKAY BUT LET ME COME DOWN. SO I CALIFORNIA 90% OF YOUTH ARE INCARCERATED. THAT ARE INCARCERATED IN JUVENILE LOS PROBATION CAMPS AND STATE DJJ YOUTH PRISONS WE'RE SUPPOSED SUSPENDED AND EXPELLED FROM SCHOOL BEFORE THEY WERE LOCKED UP LIKE MYSELF -- AND ELEMENTARY SCHOOL I WAS SUSPENDED -- FOR I WAS EXPELLED FOR BEING SUSPENDED TOO MANY TIMES AND EVENTUALLY I WAS ON PROBATION AGE. TWELVE OUT OF VIOLATED A PROBATION -- AT COMP DIES SO I HIGH SCHOOL AND I WAS ACTUALLY SENT. TO JAIL FROM COMPTON HIGH. SO I KNOW THIS PROGRAM. THE VOLUNTARY PRO PROGRAM OR PROBATION PERIOD DOESN'T GIVE YOU THE TOOLS NECESSARY TO REALLY BE SUCCESSFUL IN LIFE. SO I FEEL LIKE THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA NEED TO KNOW WHERE THEIR MONEY IS GOING AND IF IT'S GOING TO PROGRAM IS GONNA REALLY BENEFIT THE COMMUNITY. THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. GOOD MORNING ARE OR AFTERNOON AFTERNOON -- MY NAME IS FOR NAME AND ART -- BUT THE CENTER ON JUVENILE AND CRIMINAL JUSTICE. IN THE MOST RECENT YEAR REPORTED THE STATE A LOT IT A TOTAL OF ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY NINE POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS FOR JJ CPA TO REDUCE YOUTH INVOLVEMENT IN THE JUSTICE SYSTEM. THROUGH LOCAL PROGRAMMING. COUNTIES RECEIVE GRANTS NON COMPETITIVELY EVERY YEAR AND WITH LITTLE OVERSIGHT OR ACCOUNTABILITY THERE ARE RISING CONCERNS ACROSS THE STATE ABOUT POOR MANAGEMENT OF JJ CPA FINDS. RECENT EFFORTS BY RESEARCHERS TO FIND OUT HOW THESE FUNDS ARE BEING SPENT HALF ON MAJOR ISSUES WITH DATA REPORTING PRACTICES BY COUNTIES AS WELL AS THE BSE SEE. COUNTY REPORTING OF PROGRAMS ARE MINIMAL RELYING ON BRIEF PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS SOME OF WHICH HAVE NOT BEEN UPDATED YEAR TO YEAR AND REPORTING LACKS ANY STATE LEVEL SUMMARY OR ANALYSIS ON OUTCOMES. IN FACT WE'VE BEEN UNABLE TO EVEN FIND OUT THE NUMBER OF YOUTH BEING SERVED BY JJ CPA FUNDED PROGRAMS. THE JG CPA IS A VITAL INVESTMENT FOR THE STATE BUT COUNTY ALLOCATIONS DO NOT SEEM TO HAVE KEPT UP WITH THE NATIONAL BEST PRACTICES NOR CURRENT JUVENILE JUSTICE TRENDS. ACROSS THE STATE AND NATION WE ARE SEEING HISTORIC DECLINED IN USE THE REST MEANING THAT FEWER USE ARE COMING INTO CONTACT WITH THE JUSTICE SYSTEM ALL TOGETHER. YET THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT THE MAJORITY OF JJ CPA DOLLARS ARE BEING SPENT ON SALARIES AND BENEFITS NOTABLY FOR COUNTY PROBATION DEPARTMENTS DESPITE THE DROPPING NUMBERS OF YOUTH THEY SERVE. HARMFUL PROGRAMS FUNDED BY THE JJ CPA SUCH AS VOLUNTARY PROBATION WHICH IMPOSES RESTRICTIVE PROBATION SUPERVISION OVER YOUNG PEOPLE WHO HAVE NOT BEEN PROSECUTED FOR CRIME. FURTHER CRIMINALIZE YOUTH RATHER THAN PREVENTING THEIR INVOLVEMENT IN THE JUSTICE SYSTEM AS JJ CPA INTENDS. IN SOME CASES AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER JONES SAWYER MENTIONED COUNTIES ARE FAILING TO DISTRIBUTE FUNDS EFFECTIVELY LEAVING MILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND SPENT INSTEAD OF SUPPORTING YOUTH IN THE COMMUNITY. TODAY YOUR CONSTITUENTS AND FELLOW LEGISLATORS SURE DEEP CONCERNS ABOUT THE ILL SPENDING UNDER UTILIZATION AND POOR EVALUATION OF THE JJ CPA. TO PROMOTE HEALTHY AND SAFE COMMUNITIES ACROSS CALIFORNIA A STATE AUDIT IS LONG OVERDUE AND MUCH NEEDED. WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR APPROVAL OF THIS AUDIT REQUEST THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND I BELIEVE MISTER JONES SAWYER MENTIONED THIS HAS BEEN LOOKED AT FOR OVER TWO DECADES. CORRECT RIGHT WITH THAT WE'RE GONNA GO AHEAD AND MOVE TO THE STATE AUDITOR'S PRESENTATION. YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS AS AS ASSEMBLYMEMBER JONES SAWYER INDICATED THIS WOULD BE AN AUDIT OF THE J. C. PA -- THE JUVENILE JUSTICE CRIME PREVENTION ACT P. SPECIFICALLY IDENTIFIED COUNTIES THAT HE WOULD LIKE US TO TO VISIT AND REVIEW THOSE COUNTIES ARE KERN LOS ANGELES MENDOCINO SAN JOAQUIN AND SANTA BARBARA. AND THERE'S A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT OBJECTIVES THAT HE'S ASKED US TO ACCOMPLISH I'M GONNA TRY. TO ADDRESS THOSE AT A FAIRLY HIGH LEVEL -- BUT WE WILL DRILL DOWN TO ALT SO THE FIRST FIRST. A GROUP OF OBJECTIVES ARE QUESTIONS IS RELATED TO THE PROCESS FOR SOLICITING APPLICATIONS AWARDING FUNDS ALLOCATING FUNDS HOW ARE THEY GOING ON THESE RESPECTIVE COUNTIES GOING ABOUT DOING THAT ARE THERE DIFFERENCES IN. THE CONTRACTS THAT ARE OR THE AWARDS THAT ARE ARE PROVIDED WITHIN THOSE RESPECTIVE COUNTIES. THERE'S A SERIES OF QUESTIONS RELATED TO UP A PLAN THERE EACH -- COUNTY IS SUPPOSED TO PREPARE A COMPREHENSIVE MULTI AGENCY OUR JUVENILE JUSTICE PLANNED SO HE'S ASKING US TO LOOK AT THOSE PLANS HAVE THEY BEEN REVISED. OUR IS IT COMPLYING WITH US CERTAIN STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS ARE THEIR MEASURABLE OF PERFORMANCE METRICS IN THOSE PLANS HOW ARE THEY MONITORING THE ACCOMPLISHMENT OF THOSE METRICS IN THE PLANTS. CERTAINLY ASKING US TO LOOK FOR ANY UNSPENT FUNDS A FIVE YEAR -- WINDOW FIVE FISCAL YEARS THIRTEEN FOURTEEN THROUGH SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN TO DETERMINE IF THERE'S ANY ON SPENT MONEY AT EACH OF THOSE PARTICULAR COUNTIES. EACH COUNTIES RESPONSIBLE FOR HAVING A COUNCIL OF THAT WILL IS INVOLVED IN SOME OF THIS DECISION MAKING A JUVENILE JUSTICE COORDINATING COUNCIL HE'S ASKED US TO LOOK AT THE MEMBERSHIP OF THAT COUNCIL THE AUTHORITY AND RESPONSIBILITY. IS THE EACH INDIVIDUAL MEMBER OF THAT COUNCIL HAVE EQUAL OUR RESPONSIBILITY AND AUTHORITY. HOW OFTEN DO THEY MEET OUR SOME OF THE DISCUSSIONS RELATED TO HOW THEY MAKE THEIR DECISIONS -- HAVE THEY DEVELOPED BY LAWS PROTOCOLS IT CETERA SO LOOKING AT THAT COUNCIL HE'S ASKING US TO IDENTIFY DATA. WITH RESPECT TO ALLOCATION OF MONEY -- COUNTIES PROCESSES FOR AGAIN MONITORING THOSE THOSE PARTICULAR FUNDS AND THEN A VARIETY OF OF INFORMATION AGAIN OVER THAT FIVE YEAR WINDOW HOW MUCH WAS THE BUDGET HOW MUCH WAS EXPANDED. HOW MUCH OF THAT WENT TO PAY FOR PROBATION -- SALARIES OR OTHER LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OR NON LAW ENFORCEMENT A SALARY SO A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT THINGS ARE IN THAT PARTICULAR OBJECTIVE -- THE PERCENTAGE OF COUNTY PROBATION DEPARTMENTS THAT ARE SUPPORTED WITH THESE FUNDS NOT JUST THE SALARIES BUT THE PER NATION DEPARTMENT AS A WHOLE -- ALSO TRYING TO LOOK AT ISSUES RELATED TO AT RISK YOUTH THE DOLLAR AMOUNT PERCENTAGE OF COUNTY EXPENDITURES THAT ARE. REALLY USED FOR ADDRESSING AT RISK YOUTH AND PROVIDING SERVICES FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHAT'S THEIR DEFINITION OF AT RISK YOUTH DOES IT DIFFER FROM ONE COUNTY TO ANOTHER -- ASKING US TO TO DEVELOP SOME DEMOGRAPHIC INFORMATION OVER A FIVE YEAR WINDOW WITH RESPECT TO THOSE INDIVIDUALS AT THE YOUTH THAT ARE BEING SERVED BY THIS PARTICULAR PROGRAM. ON THERE WERE SOME SPECIFIC WELFARE AN INSTITUTION CODE SECTIONS THAT -- MISTER JONES SAWYER WANTED TO MAKE SURE WE LOOKED AT AND DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT THESE THESE FUNDS ARE BEING USED FOR THOSE PARTICULAR PURPOSES IN THE OUT WELFARE INSTITUTIONS CODE. IN REFERRING TO THE BOARD OF STATE COMMUNITY CORRECTIONS ASKING US TO LOOK AT THEIR PROCESSES -- FOR ENSURING THAT COUNTIES ARE COMPLYING AND AND FOLLOWING STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS AND SIMILAR OBJECTIVE TOWARD ARE REFERRING TO AS FAR AS GETTING. INFORMATION WANTING US TO TRY TO CAPTURE SOME STATEWIDE INFORMATION RELATED TO EXPENDITURES -- BUDGETS EXPENDITURES HOW MUCH SPENT ON PROBATION DEPARTMENTS STATEWIDE WE CERTAINLY WILL DRILL DOWN AT THOSE FIVE COUNTY SEE IDENTIFIED BUT ASKING US TO TRY TO CAPTURE. THROUGH THE BOARD OF STATE COMMITTEE CORRECTIONS STATEWIDE INFORMATION SO I WON'T GO THROUGH THE LAUNDRY LIST BECAUSE I JUST LAID THOSE OUT FOR YOU FOR THEIR SPECIFIC COUNTIES. AND THEN THE LAST ISSUE IS HOW MANY OF THE COUNTY STATEWIDE ARE REPORTING USING JJ CPA FUNDS -- FOR PURPOSES SPECIFIED IN THE WELL FOR AN INSTITUTION CODES -- THAT HE IDENTIFIED IN HIS REQUEST AND WE WILL CERTAINLY LOOK TO TO DETERMINE IF THERE ARE OTHER. CODE SECTIONS OR OTHER STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS THAT DOC COUNTIES NEED TO BE FOLLOWING -- SO A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT OBJECTIVES ARE THIRTY THREE HUNDRED HOURS TAKE US ABOUT EIGHT MONTHS TO GET DONE BUT AGAIN BECAUSE WE'RE NOT ONLY LOOKING AT STATE LEAD RESPONSIVE AGENCY RESPONSIBILITIES THOSE FIVE COUNTIES. AND THEN THE BOARD OF STATE COMMUNITY CORRECTIONS. THANK YOU MADAM AUDITOR FOR YOUR PRESENTATION AT THIS TIME LET'S GO TO MOVE TO THE AFFECTED AGENCIES. PLEASE THEY COME TO THE TABLE THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU IF WE CAN -- HAVE YOU FIRST START BY STATING YOUR NAME AND AFFILIATION WITH WHAT'S AGENCY AND BEGIN WITH YOUR TESTIMONY GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I'M KATIE HOWARD THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE BOARD OF STATE AND COMMUNITY CORRECTIONS. I JUST WANT A BRIGHT PROVIDE SOME ADDITIONAL BACKGROUND TODAY -- IN ADDITION TO WHAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER JONES SAWYER HAS REQUESTED AND WHAT THE STATE AUDITOR HAS REFERENCED ON THE ISSUE OF STATEWIDE AND LOCALLY AVAILABLE DATA ON JUVENILE JUSTICE. ISSUES ACROSS THE BOARD HAS BEEN SOMETHING THAT HAD QUITE A BIT OF ATTENTION IN THE LEGISLATURE -- IN THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS BACK IN THE BUDGET ACT OF TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN IN A TRAILER BILL THERE WAS A JUVENILE JUSTICE DATA WORKING GROUP PUT TOGETHER WE ACTUALLY HAVE A REALLY HELPFUL REPORT WHICH WERE. HAPPY TO PROVIDE THAT REFLECTS -- SOME OF THE LIMITATIONS IN THE AVAILABLE DATA IN THE AVAILABLE STATE WIDE DATA SYSTEMS FOR THESE KINDS OF DATA. AND I WILL JUST SAY THAT -- AS A RESULT OF ALL A WHOLE LOT OF WORK AND REVIEW AND ANALYSIS THAT WENT ON ABOUT WAS AVAILABLE WHAT WAS AVAILABLE AT THE TIME AND IN A SECOND DELIVERABLE. FROM THIS SAME WORKING GROUP ABOUT WHAT A POSSIBLE FUTURE JUVENILE JUSTICE STATEWIDE DATA SYSTEM MIGHT LOOK LIKE. THERE WERE COMPROMISES MADE. AND A LOT OF DISCUSSIONS BETWEEN ADVOCATES AND COUNTIES AND THE STATE ABOUT HOW THE JJ DATA PARTICULARLY TO THE JJ CPA AND WHILE BG. COULD BE STATS THAT YOUTH -- YOUTHFUL OFFENDER BLOCK GRANTS WHICH IS ANOTHER RELATED GRANT HERE -- AND EVEN THOUGH WE SAY GRANTS OFTENTIMES PEOPLE THINK OF THOSE AS COMPETITIVE GRANT PROGRAMS THESE THESE ARE ALLOCATED OUT TO THE COUNTIES BY FORMULA. SO ANYHOW WHAT THE MAIN POINT THAT I WANT TO SAY HERE TODAY IS THAT -- THERE WERE NEW -- PORTING REQUIREMENTS AGREED TO AND CODIFIED IN AB NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT OF TWO THOUSAND AND SIXTEEN THAT RELIED ON THE AVAILABLE STATEWIDE DATA SOURCES AND THAT ARE ADMITTEDLY LIMITED THERE'S QUITE A BIT OF DATA THAT WE'RE OF COURSE HAPPY TO PROVIDE TO THE AUDITOR ON STATEWIDE EXPENDITURES -- BY PROGRAM WHAT'S FUNDED IN J. J. C. P. A. AND WHY WILL BE G. BUT THE LEVEL OF DETAIL ABOUT THE NUMBER OF YOUTH SERVED IN THOSE PROGRAMS ISN'T AVAILABLE THE ISSUE OF OUTCOME MEASURES IS PARTICULARLY -- PROBLEMATIC AND I THINK JUST THE BOTTOM LINE POINT THAT I WANT TO MAKE TODAY IS THAT THERE'S A REAL AWARENESS -- FROM THE COUNTIES AND THE STATE THAT BECAUSE OF THESE FUNDS BEING PROTECTED BY PROPOSITION THIRTY IF THERE ARE ADDITIONAL DATA REQUIREMENTS PUT ON TO THE COUNTIES. THE STATE HAS TO PAY FOR THOSE AND THAT IS JUST REALLY QUITE FRANKLY BEEN A BIG ISSUE HERE SO -- WE'RE MORE THAN HAPPY TO SHARE ALL THE INFORMATION THAT WE HAVE WE DO GET THE REPORTS BACK FROM THE COUNTIES -- QUITE CONSISTENTLY ON HOW THEY'RE SPENDING THOSE FUNDS BUT IT SEEMS LIKE THE SPIRIT OF MISTER JONES MISTER JONES SERVICE REQUEST IS TO HAVE MORE INFORMATION ABOUT OUTCOMES WHICH I'M JUST GOING TO SAY. ARE NOT COLLECTED. THANK YOU ADDITIONAL TESTS. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAMES STEPHANIE JAMES I'M THE CHIEF PROBATION OFFICER SAN JOAQUIN COUNTY. AND I ALSO HAVE THE PLEASURE OF SERVING AS THIS YEAR'S PRESIDENT FOR THE CHEAP PROVISIONAL SERVES THE CALIFORNIA. I WHEN THE CRIME PREVENTION ACT OF TWO THOUSAND WAS PASSED RESOURCES BORN FUSED INTO COUNTY PROBATION DEPARTMENTS FOR REDUCING DELINQUENCY IN ADDRESSING JUVENILE CRIME THROUGH QUOTE PREVENTION INTERVENTION SUPPRESSION. AND INCAPACITATION. USING THESE RESOURCES AND WITH THE SUPPORT APPROVAL OF THE JUVENILE JUSTICE COORDINATING COUNCILS MANY EARLY INTERVENTION AND PREVENTION PROGRAMS AS WELL AS ENHANCE PROVISIONS SERVICES. HAVE BEEN PUT INTO PLACE THAT HAVE BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL. OUR EFFORTS STATEWIDE IN THIS AREA -- CLEAR AS THE RESULTS TO THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM HAVE BEEN ASTONISHING IN THE PAST TEN YEARS THERE HAVE BEEN A 73% REDUCTION IN JUVENILE ARRESTS. BEEN DIVERTED BY PROBATION DEPARTMENTS. THERE'S BEEN A 60% DECLINE IN YOUTH DETENTION RATES A 74% DECREASE IN DJJ POPULATIONS. AND 90% OF OUR YOUTH ARE SO IN THE JUSTICE SYSTEM OR SERVER SAFELY IN OUR COMMUNITIES. THIS IS BEEN ACCOMPLISHED BY USING VALIDATED RISK ASSESSMENTS DIVERTING LOW LEVEL YOUTH FROM THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM. TARGETING HIGHER RISK YOUTH WITH THERAPEUTIC INTERVENTIONS AND PROVIDING TARGETED INTERVENTIONS THAT ADDRESS OUR USE NEED TO HELP THEM ONTO A HEALTHY PATHWAY. THE PURPOSE OF NOT ACCOMPLISH THIS WORK ALONE. AS THE LYNCH PIN IN THE JUSTICE SYSTEM WE HAVE WORKED IN COLLABORATION WITH OUR PUBLIC AGENCY PARTNERS. BEHAVIORAL HEALTH HUMAN SERVICES SCHOOLS LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT DISTRICT ATTORNEYS AS WELL AS OUR FAITH BASED AND COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS. JJ CPA FUNDING IS JUST ONE SMALL PIECE OF FINDING INFORMATION APARTMENT. THERE ARE MANY OTHER LOCAL STATE FEDERAL FUNDING STREAMS AS WELL AS BOTH PUBLIC AND PRIVATE GRANTS. THAT ARE USED TO PROVIDE SERVICES TO YOUTH AS WELL AS TO PARTNER WITH OTHER AGENCIES. DEPARTMENT STAFF ARE HIGHLY TRAINED IN NUMEROUS EVIDENCE BASED INTERVENTIONS AND PROVIDE MANY DIRECT SERVICES TO OUR CLIENTS. THESE SERVICES ARE BASED OUR RESEARCH AND OF IMPROVING TO BE EFFECTIVE WE DELIVER THEM WITH THE FACT IF THANK AFFECT HIS MY CATS AT WORD WITH EFFECTIVENESS AND ARE ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE RESULTS. ASIAN CHIEFS ARE COMMITTED TO SERVING AT RISK YOUTH IN OUR COMMUNITY. BY PROVIDING THEM WITH SERVICES TO ADDRESS THEIR NEEDS AND TO PREVENT THEM FROM COMING WITHIN THE JUSTICE SYSTEM. I IN AS YOU WILL HEAR IN A FEW MORE MINUTES THE CHEAPER BASENESS OFFICERS OF CALIFORNIANS NOT BELIEVE THAT THE CURRENT SCOPE OF THIS AUDIT REQUEST WILL TELL THE FULL NARRATIVE OF OUR WORK. THE OUTCOMES THAT HAVE BEEN ACHIEVED AND THE PARTNERSHIP. PARTNERSHIPS THAT HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED AND SUSTAINED. THAT HAVE MADE THIS WORK SUCCESSFUL I BELIEVE IN MAKING DATA DRIVEN DECISIONS AND DO NOT BELIEVE THE ART IN ITS CURRENT FORM IS GOING TO PROVIDE THE OUTCOME DATA NECESSARY. TO ENHANCE THE SERVICES PROVIDED TO THE U.. SO I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST THAT THIS AUDIT REQUEST BE EXPANDED AND REVISED TO INCLUDE OUTCOMES RELATED TO THE PROGRAMS THAT ARE BEING FUNDED. AS WELL AS LOOK AT THE VAST ARRAY OF SERVICES THAT ARE BEING PROVIDED TO YOUTH IN OUR COMMUNITIES THERE ARE OTHER FUNDING STREAMS AS WELL. THANK YOU ADDITIONAL TESTIMONY YES HI -- GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS HI MY NAME IS A SHEILA MITCHELL ON THE CHIEF DEPUTY PREVENTION OFFICER FOR A LOS ANGELES COUNTY. I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF CHIEF MCDONNELL SINCE OUR ARRIVAL IN JANUARY OF TWO THOUSAND AND SEVENTEEN TO DO CPA HAS BEEN A KEY PRIORITY FOR US. I CHEER THE JUVENILE JUSTICE CORN IN COUNCIL ON BEHALF OF THE CHIEF I JUST WANTED TO GIVE YOU A GLIMPSE IN TERMS OF SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE BEEN DOING FOR THE PAST COUPLE OF YEARS. ONE WE HAVE -- THE JUVENILE JUSTICE CORNING COUNCIL IS NOW A TWENTY EIGHT MEMBER BODY. WHICH IS COMPRISED OF TEN COMMUNITY MEMBERS AS WELL AS COUNTY DEPARTMENTS AS WELL AS THE OFFICE OF YOU FOR DEVOTION AND DEVELOPMENT. AND OTHER -- STAKEHOLDERS THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS PUT IN PLACE IN TWO THOUSAND AND SEVENTEEN I'M ALSO IN MARCH OF TWO THOUSAND AND SEVENTEEN OF THE JUVENILE JUSTICE CLINIC COUNCIL COMMISSIONED A NEW ADVISORY COUNCIL. AND THIS IS THE COMMUNITY ADVISORY COUNCIL THAT IS CHAIRED BY A NONPROFIT JOSH GREEN WITH URBAN PIECE. AND IT IS A WAY TO SOLICIT INPUT FROM THE COMMUNITY THAT HELPS INFORM THE PLAN. IN NOVEMBER TWO THOUSAND AND SEVENTEEN WE APPROVED OR GROW FUNDS IN WHICH 81% OF ALL OF OUR ROLE FUNDS WENT TO COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS. THE MANY OF THOSE WENT TO COUNTY GOVERNMENT. IN JANUARY TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN WITH OUR NEW OFFICE OF YOU TO VERSION IN DEVELOPMENT. THE J. J. C. C. APPROVED TWELVE MILLION DOLLARS TO GO AND THAT IS REALLY ABOUT DEVOTING KIDS FROM THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM. IN MARCH OF TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN WE COMMISSIONED A NEW ON COMMITTEE AND THIS COMMITTEE WAS CHARGE WOULD REVAMPING OUR PLAN. I'M A PLAN HAD NOT BEEN REVISED IN ITS TOTALITY IT WAS TO REIMAGINE WITH THAT PLAN COULD LOOK LIKE AN OMINOUS HAVE BEEN REVISED -- IN FIFTEEN YEARS IT WAS DONE SO ON THROUGH CHAIRED IT WAS A TASK FORCE OF ABOUT TWELVE PEOPLE IT WAS CHAIRED BY -- PETITIONS SONG WITH THE CHILDREN'S DEFENSE FUND AND ONE OF OUR FELLOWS THAT THAT WE HAVE AND THE PROBATION DEPARTMENT. I THINK EARLY AS SOMEONE MENTIONED ON ONE OF THE SPEAKERS ABOUT VOLUNTARY PROBATION -- THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT WE DISCONTINUED AND TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN YOU KNOW IS A VERY DIFFICULT DECISION BECAUSE WHY WE WERE DOING VOLUNTARY PUBLICATION WITHIN THE SCHOOLS. IT WAS SOMETHING THAT THE SCHOOLS REALLY ASKED US TO DO AND THAT WE WERE DOING GOOD WORK AT HOWEVER PHILOSOPHICALLY IT WAS NOT SOMETHING THAT I WAS IN LINE WITH US DOING. AND SO WHAT WE DID IN ITS STEAD AS WE STEPPED OUT OF DOING VOLUNTARY PROBATION WE REALLY WORK WITH SOME OTHER NON PROFITS TO HELP MOVE INTO THE SCHOOLS TO TAKE. THAT WORK WE ESTABLISHED IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN IT WAS APPROVED BY A BOARD IN TWO THOUSAND AND NINETEEN SOMETHING THAT IS VERY INNOVATIVE IT'S CALLED A PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS. ANYONE KNOWS THAT WHEN YOU WORKING COUNTY GOVERNMENT BY THE TIME YOU CONCEIVE OF AN IDEA -- IN TERMS OF A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL SOMETIMES IT TAKES A YEAR TO GET THOSE FUNDS OUT. THEN SO THIS PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP THAT WE HAVE IN CONJUNCTION WITH TO FOUNDATIONS. IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY IS WITH LIBERTY HEALTH FOUNDATION AND THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY FOUNDATION ONE IS TO DO WE GRANTING WE MOVED FROM GETTING I'VE FUNDS OUT FROM A PERIOD OF ONE AND A HALF YEARS. TO A PERIOD OF THREE TO FOUR MONTHS AND THEN THE OTHER FOUNDATION IS LIBERTY HILL AND THEY DO CAPACITY BUILDING FOR US. ON TO OTHER POINTS WE REALLY REMAIN ON INFORMED OUR MISSION STATEMENT GUIDING PRINCIPLES FOR JGTC OR FUNDS -- MIRA. OUR MISSION VISION IN FACT A OF ALL OF OUR FUNDS FROM THIS -- FUNDING SOURCE GOES TO COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS WITH 13% GOING TO COUNTY GOVERNMENT. WE HAVE NO UNALLOCATED FUNDS AT THIS POINT I KNOW THAT WAS NOT THE THE THE PLACE WE WERE AT TO WHEN WE ARRIVED IN TWO THOUSAND AND SEVENTEEN A PLAN -- IS A COLLABORATIVE PLAN DEVELOP WITH A COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS A PLAN IS AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC IT IS ON A WEBSITE WE MEET REGULARLY. AND THAT IS MY TESTIMONY IF I CAN ASK IF THERE'S ANOTHER AFFECTED AGENCY IF SOMEONE CAN PROVIDE. THEM AN OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT THEIR TESTIMONY AS WELL. YOU CAN BE CONCISE WE'D APPRECIATE THAT. ABSOLUTELY AFTERNOON CHAIR COMMITTEE MEMBERS I'M TANIA HEITMANN CHIEF PROBATION OFFICER FOR SANTA BARBARA COUNTY I JUST WANT TO SHARE THAT WE WELCOME THE OPPORTUNITY TO REVIEW THE PROGRAMS AND SERVICES PROVIDED TO THE YOUTH IN SANTA BARBARA COUNTY. IN THE LAST TWO YEARS WE UNDERTOOK A DEEP DIVE INTO OUR LOCAL LOCAL JUVENILE DATA. ALTHOUGH IT WASN'T FOCUS SPECIFICALLY ON JJ CPA -- WE ARE CURRENTLY IMPLEMENTING SUBSTANTIAL CHANGES TO OUR OVERALL SYSTEM AS A RESULT OF WHAT WE LEARNED. AS SUCH WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE AUDIT EXTENDED INTO FISCAL YEARS EIGHTEEN NINETEEN AND NINETEEN TWENTY WE WOULD ALSO SUGGESTED FOR THE REVIEW OF THE SCOPE TO ENSURE IT PROVIDES A FULL PICTURE OF HOW THESE FUNDS ARE UTILIZED. AS WELL AS THE LOCAL CHALLENGES AND NEEDS BEING ADDRESSED WE THANK YOU FOR YOUR INTEREST IN OUR WORK. THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT I BELIEVE THAT'S ALL THE AFFECTED AGENCIES AT THIS TIME WE'RE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND MOVE -- BACK TO THE DYESS FOR QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS. HEARING AND SEEING NONE LET ME JUST ASK THE AUTHOR IF YOU'VE LOOKED AT SOME OF THE TESTIMONY -- PROVIDED BY THE AFFECTED AGENCIES WAS LOOKING AT MAYBE. AN EXPANDED SCOPE OF THE OUTCOMES IN THE SERVICES BEING PROVIDED IS THAT SOMETHING YOU LOOKED AT AND THE ULTIMATE DECISION AND WHAT THAT ACTUALLY WOULD BE FOR THE OUTER. YEAH AND I'M NOT SUREIF THIS IS MORE FOR THE AUDITOR'S BECAUSE IT TO IT'S REALLY A QUESTIN OF COSTS AND I KNOW I'VE DONE OTHER AUDITS BEFORE. AND PART OF LIMITING IT WAS. ACTUALLY THE THE BUDGET AND STAFFING THAT THEY HAVE -- WE WENT IN THIS DIRECTION ECAUSE WE THOUGHT WE WOULD GET THE MOST BANG FOR A BUCK AND TO BE ABLE TO GET THE INFORMATION WE WANTED SO I I'M NOT TRYING. TO AVOID YOUR QUESTION BUT CORRECT. IF IF FOR FOR MY PERSPECTIVE IF WE HAVE THE RESOURCES WE HAVE TO STAFF ANY RESOURCES WE SHOULD DO IT. AND THE FUNDING TO DO IT -- BUT I DON'T WANT TO COMPROMISE THE ENTIRE AUDIT BECAUSE WE WE OVER DO NO WORRIES SO. SO MISTER CHAIRMAN ONE OF THE ONE OF THE COMMENTS WAS AS FAR AS LOOKING AT THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THESE PROGRAMS AND HOW AND I THERE WERE. WARS INFORMATION PROVIDED AS FAR AS THE NUMBER OF YOUTH -- WHO ARE NO LONGER ENGAGED IN AT LAW ENFORCEMENT PROCESS THERE THERE ACTUALLY IS AN OBJECTIVE? IN THE IN THE AUDIT REQUEST AND IN OUR ANALYSIS THAT ASKS US TO DETERMINE HOW EFFECTIVE THESE PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN AND REDUCING INTERACTIONS. BETWEEN YOUTH IN THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM SO I THINK WE WOULD BE ABLE TO GET AT THAT PARTICULAR COMMENT WITH THE EXISTING SCOPE -- THAT WE HAVE DEVELOPED AS FAR AS EXPANDING THE NUMBER OF YEARS WE'RE LOOKING AT WE'RE ALREADY LOOKING AT FIVE FISCAL YEARS -- WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO SOME OF THE THE COMMENTS MADE LOOKING AT NINETEEN TWENTY I MEAN IT'S NOT EVEN NINETEEN TWENTY YET IT WILL BE SOON -- BUT I THINK. THE THE OBJECTIVES THAT MISTER JONES SAWYER HAS ASKED US TO ACCOMPLISH LOOKING AT A FIVE YEAR WINDOWWILL IDENTIFY SOME TRENDS -- SO. IT WOULD BE A SCOPE MODIFICATION THERE CERTAINLY RULES RELATED TO THE COMMITTEE IT WOULD BE AN EXPANSION OF THE AUDIT. ALSO I WOULD HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THAT I DO THINK THERE'S A LOT OF INFORMATION THAT -- MISTER JONES SAWYER IS ASKING US TO CAPTURE AND I DO THINK WE WILL BE ABLE TO GET AT SOME OF THE DEMOGRAPHICS HOPEFULLY AT LEAST IT AT THE SPECIFIC COUNTIES MAYBE NOT IT IS STATEWIDE BASIS BASED ON SOME OF THE COMMENTS MADE -- BUT CERTAINLY WE WILL BE. HOPING TO LOOK AT I'M SOME OF THE REDUCTIONS THERE IS THAT SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE AS FAR AS THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OF MANY OF THESE PROGRAMS THAT HAVE BEEN FUNDED BY THIS ACT. UNDER THE PARAMETERS OF THE AUDIT WE WILL BE ABLE TO ANSWER SOME OF THESE QUESTIONS AS TO THE EFFECTIVENESS AND THE OUTCOMES AS WELL WE WERE HOPING. TO THANK YOU ALL RIGHT WITH THAT LET'S GO TO MOVE TO PUBLIC COMMENT TO HAVE PUBLIC COMMENT ON THIS ITEM. WE DO IF YOU COULD PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME AND AFFILIATION IF YOU WERE ARE WITH THE GROUP OR WHICH COUNTY YOU LIVE IN. PLEASE PROCEED. AND IF YOU CAN MAKE YOUR COMMENTS CONCISE IN UNDER TWO MINUTES PLEASE I GET AFTERNOON MY NAME IS DOMINIQUE YOUNG FOR THE CHILDREN'S DEFENSE FUND CALIFORNIA I JUST WANT TO PROVIDE SOME ADDITIONAL PERSPECTIVE FROM LA COUNTY ABOUT THE NEED FOR THE STATE RIGHT AUDIT. AS SHEET METAL SAID THERE ARE A LOT IMPROVEMENTS THAT HAVE HAPPENED SINCE TWENTY SEVENTEEN BUT THOSE ARE MAINLY PROPELLED BY DISTURBING FINDINGS BY ADVOCATES IN TWENTY SIXTEEN THAT WERE NOT INCLUDED IN THE AUDIT. AND THOUGH IT'S MAINLY INCLUDED ONE I'M AN ADMISSION BY THE RAND CORPORATION WHO IS THE LEAD RESEARCHER SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND ONE FOR LA COUNTY. HE SAID THAT THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE IN THE YEARS PRIOR IN THE FIFTEEN YEARS TO SHOW THAT ANY OF THE CHICKIES CPA FUNDED PROGRAMS WERE EFFECTIVE AT REDUCING RECIDIVISM OR IMPROVING YOUTH OUTCOMES. AND SECOND THEY GET REGARDING VOLUNTARY PROBATION THAT I'VE GONE TO THE POINT WHERE IN TWENTY FOURTEEN TO TWENTY FIFTEEN MORE THAN HALF APPROPRIATIONS CASELOAD WERE ACTUALLY YOUTH WHO HAD NEVER BEEN ARRESTED. AND BASED ON THIS INFORMATION I JUST WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THAT THERE IS A REAL NEED FOR STATEWIDE AUDIT FOR OVERSIGHT ACCOUNTABILITY AND IMPROVEMENTS BECAUSE WHAT TYPE OF ADVOCACY CANNOT AND SHOULD NOT NEED TO BE REPLICATED ACROSS THE STATE. THANK YOU. MY NAME IS MICHAEL AND DOES AND ON THE POLICY DIRECTOR FOR THE ANTI RECIDIVISM COALITION. A WIN ORGANIZATION THAT IS COMPRISED OF IN SERVICE FORMALLY COSTS FOR INDIVIDUALS THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND THEY'RE AND MANY DIFFERENT COUNTIES -- I LIVE IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY AND IN MANY DIFFERENT COUNTIES THESE INDIVIDUALS NEED SERVICES. IT'S BEEN OVER CLOSE TO TWENTY YEARS -- SINCE WE'VE HAD NOT ON THIS AND I THINK THIS IS THE RIGHT TIME SEEN THAT WE'VE SEEN. DECLINES IN YOU THE REST AND MORE DIVERSION FOR THIS POPULATION SO -- WE NEED SERVICE IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND I THINK THIS IS A GREAT TIME TO HAVE THIS AUDIT DONE -- MAN WITH THIS ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU. DOES ANYONE CAME WITHIN WITH THE ALLIANCE FOR BOYS AND MEN OF COLOR AT POLICY LINK FIRST WE WANT TO THANK THE CHAMPION OF THIS WE THINK SOMEONE NUMBER JONES SAWYER -- AND THE ALLIANCES MADE UP OF A NETWORK OF OVER TWO HUNDRED PLUS PARTNERS THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- I CURRENTLY RESIDE IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY HOWEVER OUR COMMUNITY MEMBERS AND COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS ARE LARGELY BEING LEFT OUT OF THE DECISION MAKING PROCESS FOR HOW THE JJ CPA FUNDS ARE BEING SPENT. WITH POOR TRANSPARENCY IN REPORTING THE COMMUNITIES THAT WE SERVE HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO FIND OUT ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF JJ CPA FUNDED PROGRAMS WITHOUT THE STATE AUDITOR'S SUPPORT. SOME COUNTIES ARE FUNDING HARMFUL PROGRAMS LIKE VOLUNTARY PROBATION WHICH SUBJECT YOUTH WITH NOT COMMITTED A CRIME TO RESTRICTIVE AN INVASIVE PROBATION REQUIREMENTS. WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE TO LOOK INTO HOW THIS IS AFFECTING COMMUNITIES LIKE THE ONES THAT I SERVE AND BUT I LIVE IN. AND DECIDE IS GREATLY NEEDED THANK YOU THANK YOU ADDITIONAL PUBLIC COMMENT PLEASE -- GOOD AFTERNOON WHEN A STATUS MY NAME IS ISRAEL VIA ON THE PROGRAM POLICY COORDINATOR WITH ME BY OUT IN SALINAS MONTEREY COUNTY -- WE ARE PROUD CALL SPONSORS OF THIS REQUEST -- THIS AT THIS STANDS NOW THESE RACES ARE NOT BEING INVESTED IN EFFECTIVE DO PROGRAMA SERVICES AS RECIDIVISM ROOTS REMAIN VERY VERY HIGH. VERY LITTLE LEASES ARE BEING SHARED WITH CRUCIAL AND OFTEN THE MOST EFFECTIVE STAKEHOLDERS WHEN IT COMES TO NOT WORKING WITH OUR CHILDREN BUT EMBRACING HELPING ELEVEN THESE CHILDREN. AND THAT BEING COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS. OF FORTY SOME OF THESE FUNDS HAVE BEEN USED TO FIND SOME TYPE OF WANT TO PROBATION WHICH IS ONE OF THE STRINGS CONCEPT I'VE HEARD OF THE DECISION MAKING PROCESS IS NOT EQUITABLE AGAIN. ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT STAKEHOLDERS IS LEFT OUT. OR OR VERY MINIMAL INCLUSION THAT'S ON ON MONDAY COUNTERS ONE COMMUNITY SEAT -- SO AGAIN THIS IS NOT EMBRACING OR A REFLECTIVE OUR COMMUNITY COMMUNITY STAKE HOLDERS COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS FORMING CARCERI IT AND DIRECTLY IMPACTED FAMILIES WHICH ARE VERY VERY IMPORTANT STAKEHOLDERS AT WHAT MUCH TO CONTRIBUTE TO THIS CONVERSATION -- WHERE DAD IS CONCERNED THERE AGAIN THERE'S VERY VERY LIMITED DATA VERY VERY LIMITED -- REPORTING REQUIREMENTS -- WE HAVE CONCERNS OF HOW MUCH. OF THESE RESOURCES ARE ARE BEING USED THE GAME THE AS IT WAS MENTIONED THERE IS NO NUMBERS TO SEE HOW MANY YOUTH ARE BEING HELPED -- BUT ONE THING THAT I DID CLEARLY READ FROM THE B. S. E. C.'S YEARLYCHECK THE CPA REPORT IS THAT THE MAJORITY THESE FUNDS ARE GOING. TO SALARIES AND BENEFITS SPECIFICALLY NOT TO OUR KIDS WHICH IS VERY VERY ALARMING AND DISHEARTENING -- I THINK WHAT'S GOING ON IN LA IS EXACTLY WHEN THIS HAPPENED ACROSS THE STATE THEY INCLUDED MUCH MORE COMMUNITY SEATS TO THEIR JUVENILE JUSTICE COMMISSION THEY'VE ALSO INCLUDE A COMMUNITY OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT WE NEED IN OUR COUNTY AND ACROSS THE STATE. AND WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AND I WILL THANK YOU. NO PUBLIC COMMENT [inaudible] PLEASE. GOOD AFTERNOON BRIAN GOLDSTINE WITH THE CENTER ON JUVENILE AND CRIMINAL JUSTICE. IN MAY TWENTY EIGHTEEN CJ CJ RELEASED A REPORT LOOKING AT FIVE BAY AREA COUNTIES AND HOW THEY USE. J. C. K. FUNDING AND OUR FINDINGS WEREALARMING. WE FOUND THAT 75% OF THE FUNDING WAS GOING -- TO COUNTY SALARIES AND A SMALL PORTION OF IT WAS GOING TO COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS. WE ALSO FOUND THAT MILLIONS OF FUNDING WAS UNSPENT WHEN WE WENT OUT INTO THE COMMUNITY WHEN WE WENT OUT INTO COUNTIES. AND PRESENTED ON HER FINDINGS WHAT WAS ALSO ALONG WITH THE FACT THAT. KEY JUVENILE JUSTICE STAKEHOLDERS DOING THE WORK EVERY DAY. WE'RE NOT INVOLVED THEY WEREN'T PART OF THIS COLLABORATION. WE THINK THIS AUDIT IS ESSENTIAL AND WE HOPE THAT YOU SUPPORT THANK YOU THANK YOU. ADDITIONAL TO PUBLIC COMMENT PLEASE. A GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS LAURIE DELFI ON THE ODD POLICY DIRECTOR AT THE W. HE WOULD BURNS INSTITUTE WERE A NATIONAL NONPROFIT BASED IN OAKLAND. AND YOU WORK TO REDUCE RACIAL NOTHING DISPARITIES IN THE JUSTICE SYSTEM. I'M HERE TODAY TO STRONGLY SUPPORT THE JG CPA AUDIT -- AND AND TWENTY FIFTEEN I SAT ON THE JUVENILE JUSTICE STATUS -- WORKING GROUP THAT WAS MAKING RECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPROVEMENTS ON DATA COLLECTION FOR JJ CPA AND THE YOUTH CENTER BLOCK GRANT PROGRAM I'M PLEASED THAT SOME OF THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS WERE BROUGHT TO WERE WERE -- MOVE FORWARD BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE LEARNED IN THAT IS ALSO INCORPORATED IN THE REPORT IS pTHAT THE JJ CPA OF BRICK. REPORTING IS REALLY COMPLIANCE MONITORING IT DOESN'T TALK A LOT ABOUT WHAT THE IMPACT IS BOTH ON THE YOUTH AND THEIR FURTHER TRAJECTORY INTO THE JUSTICE SYSTEM AND THAT SOMETHING WE NEED TO NOW THIS IS A HUGE INVESTMENT OF FUNDS. THAT CAN IMPACT A HUGE NUMBER OF CHILDREN IN THE STATE AND WE NEED TO KNOW WHAT THE RETURN ON THAT INVESTMENT IS -- AND WHAT WE DON'T KNOW A LOT ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH THOSE FUNDS AND pARE WE DO KNOW THAT THERE'S TENS OF THOUSANDS OF KIDS WHO ARE COMING INTO THE JUSTICE SYSTEM. THAT DON'T NEED TO BE THERE THAT HAVE LOW LEVEL OFFENSES MISDEMEANOR IN STATUS OFFENSES THAT DON'T NEED TO HAVE THEIR PETITION FILED IN COURT. ONE THING THAT I WOULD NOTE THOUGH IS THAT IN THE C. POCK OPPOSITION LETTER THERE'S REFERENCE 267% OF YOU TWO ARE REFERRED TO PROBATION BEING DIVERTED OUT OF THE SYSTEM. AND IF WE LOOK AT THE LATEST DATA THAT'S AVAILABLE FROM THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE WHICH IS THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN DATA OF THE APPROXIMATELY SEVENTY ONE THOUSAND YOUTH WHO WERE REFERRED TO PROBATION 53% OF THEM HAD A FORMAL PETITION FILED IN COURT. 5655% OF THOSE YOUTH WERE USED WHO HAD COMMITTED MISDEMEANOR STATUS OFFENSES SO THERE'S A LARGE SWATH OF YOUTH WE ARE NOT REACHING CURRENTLY WITH JJ CPA THAT WE NEED TO TOUCH. AND THOSE NUMBERS ARE DESPERATELY IMPACTING YOUTH OF COLOR 44% OF WHITE YOUTH I REFER WHO ARE REFERRED A PETITION DONE. COMPARED 262% OF BLACK YOUTH AND THANK YOU DESPITE ALL PUBLIC COMMENT. GOOD EVENING WHEN I STARTED IS MY NAME IS JAMES MARTINEZ WITH ME BY. I AM A YOLO COUNTY CONSTITUENTS AND I STRONGLY SUPPORT THE JJ CPA AUDIT -- AS I WAS HEARING YOU KNOW I'M A BIG BELIEVER IN CHANGE AND I UNDERSTAND THAT ADVANCEMENT DEMANDS CHANGE AND I THINK IT'S TIME FOR US NOW TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT. WHAT WHAT'S HAPPENING THEN IS NOT WORKING NOW? AND WE CAN SEE THIS AS THE PROOF IS IN THE PUDDING. IN A LOT OF TIMES I THINK WE GET CAUGHT UP ON WHAT WE WANT WITH THE SELF BUT OFTEN WE FORGET ABOUT OTHERS OUTSIDE OF OURSELVES. AND ONE THING I FOR THAT WE NEED TO KEEP IN MIND HERE TODAY. IS HOW THE PRACTICES ARE NOT WORKING AND AS YOU CAN SEE HERE HOW IT IT WAS MENTIONED IN THE THE FUNDING IS. IS BASICALLY BUT EVEN BEING PUT TOWARDS. SYSTEMS ARE BEING INEFFECTIVE. AND IF SOMETHING'S BEING INEFFECTIVE IN THE WATER WE CONTINUE TO FUNNEL RESOURCES IN AN AREA WHERE IT'S NOT BEING. MEANINGFUL -- BEING SOMEONE WHO WAS FORMALLY SYSTEM IMPACTED. I'M I'M SPEAKING FROM EXPERIENCE I'M NOT SPEAKING FROM WHAT I READ I'M NOT SPEAKING FROM WHAT I HEARD I'M SPEAKING FROM HANDS ON EXPERIENCE AND I'M A BIG BELIEVER. THAT THOSE THAT ARE CLOSEST TO THE PROBLEM OF THE ONES CLOSEST TO THE SOLUTION AND THE SOLUTION HERE TODAY IS THIS AUDIT TO ENSURE THAT. EVERYTHING IS GOING ACCORDINGLY TO THE WISHES OF THE PEOPLE AND JUST NOT THE WISHES OF A SELECT GROUP THE IN GROUP. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ADDITIONAL PUBLIC COMMENT. HELLO MY NAME IS CHRISTIAN FRANCO AND I WORK REGIONALLY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WORKING WITH USE YOU FOR SYSTEM IMPACTED JUST AS THE BALL. ON JUVENILE HALL FROM SACRAMENTO COUNTY YOLO COUNTY -- SOLANO COUNTY AND ALSO AT THE STATE LEVEL AT DJJ AS WELL AND SO MY THIS AUDIT. IS SUPPORTED -- TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE INVESTING. IN THE RIGHT AREAS RIGHT THAT THE PROGRAMS THAT ARE MOST EFFECTIVE -- IN REDUCING RECIDIVISM AND DIVERT IN OUR YOUNG PEOPLE -- ARE ALLOCATED FOR RIGHT -- SO IT'S A IT'S A GRAND OPPORTUNITY FOR US AS THE STATE TO DO THIS I WORK WITH THESE FOLKS EVERYDAY I ACTUALLY -- CANCEL MY BJJ -- PROGRAMMING TODAY. FIFTY YOUTH THAT I REACH AT THE STATE LEVEL TO COME HERE AND ASK THAT YOU ARE SUPPORT THIS AUDIT. THANK YOU. ADDITIONAL PUBLIC COMMENT. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I'D DANIEL SANCHEZ ON BEHALF OF THE CHIEF PROBATION OFFICERS OF CALIFORNIA REALLY APPRECIATE BEING ABLE TO BE HERE TODAY THIS IS A EXTREMELY IMPORTANT -- TOPIC BOTH FOR US AS WE KNOW IT IS FOR ASSEMBLYMEMBER JONES SAWYER -- A FEW COMMENTS THAT I WANT -- TO KIND OF IN PART TO THIS COMMITTEE IN AND HOPE THAT YOU'LL CONSIDER GOING FORWARD -- GIGI CPA HAS BEEN A TRULY TRANSFORMATIVE -- INVESTMENT IN LOCAL SYSTEMS -- WHEN IT WAS ENACTED THE FOCUS REALLY WAS ON -- TO INFUSE THE LOCAL SYSTEM AND FOR A LOOK AT THE LOCAL DEVELOPMENT OF A PLAN THAT MEETS SENSE BASED ON THOSE NEEDS -- AND AND WHAT THE SERVICE -- REQUIREMENTS AND NEEDS WERE OF THE LOCALITY -- THAT HAS LED TO AND I THINK THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT POINT THAT WE DON'T FORGET HAS LED TO HISTORIC DECLINES IN BOTH ARREST AND DETENTION -- DIVERSION IS A VERY MUCH A FOCAL POINT OF PROBATION AND SOMETHING THAT WE KNOW IS A IS A GROWING FOCUS AND SO WHEN WE LOOK AT THE SYSTEM THERE SIGNIFICANT DATA TO SHOW THAT -- BOTH THE WITH WITH JJ CPA AND OTHER FUNDING SOURCES THAT THERE HAVE BEEN. SIGNIFICANT ADVANCEMENTS THAT CONTINUE TO BE MADE AND I I JUST DON'T WANT THAT POINT TO BE LOST AND THAT THIS IS IT GETTING TO THE RIGHT EFFECTIVE APPROACHES -- WE CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THAT IS THAT IS THAT COMMITTEES DESIRE TO TO LOOK AT THESE THINGS -- BUT WE'RE CONCERNED THAT THE WAY THE SCOPE IS CURRENTLY DRAFTED THAT IT MAY NOT CAPTURE ALL OF THE PIECES THAT -- WE THINK BOTH THE AUTHOR WOULD BE INTERESTED IN THE LEGISLATURE BE INTERESTED IN OR THAT REALLY PAINTS THE FULL PICTURE -- OF THE TYPES OF PROGRAMMING THAT IS HAPPENING SO IF YOU THINGS I WOULD -- NOTE -- THE ANNUAL REPORT AS WE MENTIONED THERE IS ANNUAL REPORTING THAT IS HAPPENING -- AND SO WE THINK THAT THAT IS SOMETHING THAT -- IS ALREADY IN MANY WAYS CAPTURED WITHIN THAT THE SCOPE OF THE AUDIT -- REGARDING THE TIMELINE IT DOES MENTION -- UP UNTIL. SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN I THINK INCLUDING EIGHTEEN NINETEEN IS IMPORTANT SIGNIFICANT CHANGES HAPPEN YEAR OVER YEAR AND SO NOT HAVING THAT LAST YEAR IN THIS COULD MISS SOME SOME VALUABLE INSIGHTS -- THE REQUESTEDTHIS IS ON ONE PARTICULAR FUNDING SOURCES AND AS WE KNOW BECAUSE THESE AREN'T FUSIONS AND A LOCAL SYSTEM AND THERE'S BLENDING OF SOURCES AND AND FIGURING OUT HOW BEST TO A RE SOURCE THE LOCAL COMMUNITIES. THAT AGAIN IT MAY NOT PAY THE FULL PICTURE FOR LOOKING AT ONE SPECIFIC SOURCE FOR ONE SPECIFIC PURPOSE -- THE ONE OTHER THING WE WOULD ENCOURAGE JUST OUT COMMITTEE IS TO LOOK AT OTHER METRICS THAT MAY BE IMPORTANT. ON THE PHONE THE FOCUS IN MANY WAYS SEEMS TO BE ON WHERE THE DOLLARS ARE GOING INTO TO WHICH ENTITIES -- BUT THAT DOESN'T NECESSARILY GET OUT QUALITY OF SERVICES OUTCOMES FOR YOUTH AND OTHER IMPORTANT FACTORS THAT WE THINK AGAIN ARE PART OF MAKING SURE WE'RE DOING. THE RIGHT THINGS THAT WE ALL WANT TO SEE HAPPENING INTHIS REGARD -- AND THEN THOUGH THE ONE OTHER POINT I WOULD SAY IS THAT -- I THINK THERE'S BEEN A DISCUSSION ON THIS BEING A GRANT PROCESS WITH KIND OF SOLICITATIONS AND AND GRANTEES AGAIN THIS WAS NOT DESIGNS NECESSARILY IN THAT FASHION THIS WAS DESIGNED AS AS THAT HAS BEEN DISCUSSED WITH THE LOCAL JJ CC. ON TO DEVELOP THAT PLAN AND THEN IMPLEMENT FROM THERE AND SO WE THINK THAT'S AN IMPORTANT POINT THAT SOME OF THE QUESTIONS MAY NOT COMPLETELY COMPORT WITH I THINK HOW -- THE PROGRAM WAS DESIGNED IN AND DOLLARS ARE FLOWING SO -- WITH THAT WE APPRECIATE THE DISCUSSION CERTAINLY GLAD TO BE PART OF IT I THINK WE WENT ON CERTAINLY ASK AND HOPE THAT THERE'S CONSIDERATION BY THIS COMMITTEE TO HAVE MORE DISCUSSION ABOUT THE SCOPE OF THE AUDIT -- IF IT IS TO MOVE FORWARD TO MAKE SURE WE CAN DO ALL THE THINGS THAT ARE DESIRED BY THIS COMMITTEE AND THE LEGISLATURE THANK YOU. ADDITIONAL TESTIMONY FROM THE PUBLIC IF YOU CAN KEEP YOUR COMMENTS CONCISE. WE APPRECIATE THAT THANK YOU. HELLO EVERYONE MY NAME IS ARE YOU THOMAS ARM FROM THE YOU JUST COALITION ALL IN ENGLISH CALIFORNIA AND I'M HERE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THE JAYS A CPA AUDIT REQUEST. THIS ISSUE MATTERS TO ME BECAUSE MY EXPERIENCE BEING ON PROBATION FOR THREE YEARS FROM THE AGE SIXTEEN OPUS EIGHT SCENE WAS A VERY HUMILIATING EXPERIENCE. DURING THE ENTIRE TIME I WAS ON PROBATION I NEVER HAD A SUPPORT AND ROLLING IN SCHOOL ONCE I WAS KICKED OUT AND OUT OF SCHOOL FOR MONTHS. I WAS TOLD TO DO ANGER MANAGEMENT CLASSES FOR HIGH RISK HIGH NEEDS YOU BUT MY MOTHER COULDN'T AFFORD. THE FEES SO BASICALLY ALL I GOT DURING THOSE THREE YEARS WAS DRUG TESTED. ARE YOU TELLING ME THAT THE STATE SHOULD GIVE LA COUNTY FORTY FORTY MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR AS WELL MORE THAN SIXTY MY AS OTHER COUNTRIES. YOU DON'T WANT TO SEE HOW THEY SPEND IT. ON IF THE PROBATION DEPARTMENT WE'RE USING MONEY RESPONSIBLY THEY SHOULD SPONSOR THIS AUDIT INSTEAD OF INSTEAD OF PUTTING MORE MONEY INTO PROBATION WE SHOULD PUT MORE MONEY INTO OUR COMMUNITIES. AND JOB CENTERS AND YOUTH CENTERS NO THINGS THAT HELP US IN LONG RUN SO I RESPECT I RESPECTFULLY ASKS FOR YOUR A VOTE. THANK YOU. ADDITIONAL PUBLIC COMMENT. IRVING OUR IS WITH YOU JUST COALITION AND BROTHERS ON THEMSELVES COALITION -- TO AS A PRODUCT OF SCHOOL TO PRISON PIPELINE -- I MEAN SEVENTEEN YEARS OLD I'M BEING ARRESTED FOR LOITERING -- AND BEING ON PROBATION FOR THREE YEARS WAS SOMETHING THAT I NEVER SAW UP CORRECT. LOW DURING YOU KNOW HANGING OUT. I WISH THE YOU KNOW I'M A SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD ANY ANY KID WOULD DO THAT HANG OUT YOU KNOW. AND JUST BEING DRUG TESTED AND PROBATION OFFICER PULLING UP TO MY HOUSE EVERY HOUR WHEN HE FEELS LIKE IT THAT'S ARREST ME. YOU KNOW THAT'S NOT INVESTING IN OUR YOUTH DOES NOT MAKE IN OUR FUTURE ALL UP GROW AND BE BETTER. THAT'S ACTUALLY HOLDING US BACK IN -- NOT MAKING AS LEARN ANYTHING BEHIND FOUR WALLS THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT LET ME TURN BACK. TO THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER IF YOU'D LIKE TO CLOSE. THANK YOU AND I JUST JUST SAY A FEW KEY THINGS ARM AT AS YOU KNOW SHOULD CHEER YOU AND I CAME IN A TWENTY TWELVE AND ONE OF THE THINGS WE TALKED ABOUT WAS OVERSIGHT. AND BECAUSE WE HAD TWELVE YEARS INSTEAD OF SIX WE'RE IN A SEVENTY YEAR. WE WOULD BE GONE. THERE WOULD BE NOBODY. THERE WOULD BE NO OVERSIGHT TO WOULD BE NO DISCUSSION ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON THAT'S THE BEAUTY OF THE INTELLIGENCE OF THE ELECTORATE TO GIVE US TWELVE YEARS. A CITY WE HAVE THIS OPPORTUNITY LOOK AT THINGS AND IS LISTEN TO SOME OF THE DISCUSSION AND THE WISDOM OF THE COUNTY. TO TO STOP A PROGRAM THAT WAS NOT FUNCTIONING -- FOR FOR MAYBE TWENTY OR TEN YEARS IF THEY HAD ONGOING OVERSIGHT LIKE THIS IT MAY HAVE BEEN CAUGHT SOONER. AND THAT'S WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT THE TO HAVE THIS OVERSIGHT MY INTENT. IS TO SH TO HIGHLIGHT. THE GOOD THINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING AND THE THINGS THAT NEED IMPROVEMENT I DON'T SAY BAD ADJUSTED THINGS THAT NEED IMPROVEMENT TRY TO FIGURE THAT OUT -- ANY REASON IT'S SO IMPORTANT WE DO IT NOW. AND WITH THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM IT BECAUSE THE GOVERNOR OF THIS STATE. HAS DECIDED THAT. HE'S GOING TO TOTAL SEA CHANGE IN THE WAY WE DO DEAL WITH JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM THEY'VE TAKEN IT OUT THE CDC ARE AND WE'RE TRYING TO DEVELOP. WHAT THAT NEW PARADIGM WILL BE? WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS. I THINK THIS AUDIT WILL HELP US GET TO THAT THIS AUDIT WILL HELP US LEARN HOW COUNTIES AND CITIES AND AN SEC ALL WORK TOGETHER NOW. AND AGAIN LOOK AT THE THINGS THAT ACTUALLY WORK. SO THAT WE CAN INCORPORATE THOSE THINGS. IN THIS NEW SYSTEM THAT GOVERNOR NEWSOME -- PLANTS TO CREATE. AND AND AND JUST JUST FINALLY ONE OF THE FRUSTRATING THINGS. THAT HAPPEN BEFORE ANY THE PEOPLE THAT WERE HERE -- PROBABLY WERE INVOLVED -- I WAS CHAIR BUDGET SUB. FIVE I WAS ABLE TO GET A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. FOR REHABILITATION PROGRAMS. AND IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN I ASKED HOW. THAT MONEY WAS SPENT -- AND DIDN'T GET ANY RESPONSE THIS LEGISLATURE DISASSEMBLY THIS ASSEMBLY MEMBER WAS IGNORED. ON EVEN BY MY OWN COUNTY COUNTY OF LA COULD NOT GET INFORMATION ON HOW EFFECTIVE THESE PROGRAMS WHAT HAPPENED TO THE MONEY WHERE THE MONEY IS COULD NOT GET A RESPONSE FROM MY OWN. COUNTY. THINK ABOUT I JUST SAID WE GAVE THEM A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS AND I COULDN'T FIND OUT HOW THE MONEY WAS SPENT IN MY HOME. DISTRICT AND I GOT THE MUCH. THAT'S WHY. THIS AUDIT IS SO IMPORTANT THAT WE GET THIS INFORMATION OUT SO THAT. ONE THAT THIS LEGISLATURE IS RESPECTED. TO THAT WE DO OUR FIDUCIARY RESPONSIBILITY WHICH IS TO HAVE OVERSIGHT. WE NEED TO START DOING IT NOW. WHEN A SEVENTY YEAR? IF NOT NOW WHEN. SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE [inaudible] ALL RIGHT.
