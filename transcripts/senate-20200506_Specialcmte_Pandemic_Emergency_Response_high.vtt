00:07:15.968 --> 00:07:16.969
LAUNCHED WE KNEW THAT

00:07:17.036 --> 00:07:19.205
CALIFORNIA WAS DOING SOMEWHERE

00:07:19.272 --> 00:07:21.107
BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND AND FIVE

00:07:21.174 --> 00:07:23.009
THOUSAND P. C. R. S. DIAGNOSTIC

00:07:23.075 --> 00:07:25.311
TESTS PER DAY. AND WE KNEW THAT

00:07:25.378 --> 00:07:26.512
WE NEEDED TO SCALE UP FROM

00:07:26.579 --> 00:07:28.881
THERE AND SO THE GOAL THAT WE

00:07:28.948 --> 00:07:30.216
WERE GIVEN WAS RAPIDLY SCALING

00:07:30.283 --> 00:07:33.152
UP TESTING GOAL OF TWENTY FIVE.

00:07:33.219 --> 00:07:34.587
I THINK PER DAY BY THE END OF

00:07:34.654 --> 00:07:36.656
APRIL. I WE HAD A MID APRIL

00:07:36.722 --> 00:07:38.024
GOAL OF TEN THOUSAND TEST PER

00:07:38.090 --> 00:07:40.126
DAY. AND WE WERE EVEN ABLE TO

00:07:40.193 --> 00:07:41.627
MEET THAT GOAL OF TEN THOUSAND

00:07:41.694 --> 00:07:43.396
PRESS HAS PRETTY MET APRIL AND

00:07:43.462 --> 00:07:45.031
THEN MEET THE GOAL OF TWENTY

00:07:45.097 --> 00:07:45.998
FIVE THOUSAND TEST TODAY BY THE

00:07:46.065 --> 00:07:47.466
END OF THE MONTH. AND TODAY

00:07:47.533 --> 00:07:49.535
WERE IN THE LOW THIRTY

00:07:49.602 --> 00:07:51.537
THOUSANDS TEST PER DAY. I'M FOR

00:07:51.604 --> 00:07:55.341
CALIFORNIA. AND THE STRATEGY

00:07:55.408 --> 00:07:56.809
THAT WE USE TO MEET THAT GOAL

00:07:56.876 --> 00:07:58.144
AND THAT WERE USING MOVING

00:07:58.211 --> 00:08:00.179
FORWARD. IS TO TAKE A REALLY

00:08:00.246 --> 00:08:01.447
CAREFUL LOOK AT A NUMBER OF

00:08:01.514 --> 00:08:03.649
DIFFERENT FACTORS NUMBER ONE IS

00:08:03.716 --> 00:08:04.483
LOOKING AT. WHAT IS THE

00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:06.986
INSTALLED CAPACITY ACROSS THE

00:08:07.053 --> 00:08:11.524
STATE. IT'S OUR TASK FORCE ARE

00:08:11.591 --> 00:08:12.925
THROUGH LOTS OF. PHONE CALLS

00:08:12.992 --> 00:08:15.695
AND EMAILS CONDUCTED ALL. DOING

00:08:15.761 --> 00:08:16.863
CLOSE WITH THE HAAS. TO DID.

00:08:16.929 --> 00:08:18.598
WHAT IS THE INSTALLED CAPACITY

00:08:18.664 --> 00:08:19.565
OF THE HIGH THROUGHPUT

00:08:19.632 --> 00:08:21.934
MACHINES. WHO'S DOING TESTING

00:08:22.001 --> 00:08:23.703
HOW MUCH PCR TESTING CAN THEY

00:08:23.769 --> 00:08:25.938
DO PER DAY. AND THE THROUGH THE

00:08:26.005 --> 00:08:27.139
DATA THAT WE GATHERED WE ARE

00:08:27.206 --> 00:08:28.541
ABLE TO DETERMINE THAT

00:08:28.608 --> 00:08:30.710
CALIFORNIA- HAS INCREDIBLE

00:08:30.776 --> 00:08:33.079
CAPACITY TO DO PCR TESTING. BUT

00:08:33.145 --> 00:08:34.380
THERE ADDITIONAL CHALLENGES IN

00:08:34.447 --> 00:08:36.148
THE SUPPLY CHAIN. OUR TEST

00:08:36.215 --> 00:08:37.884
THREE ASIANS- KITS AND

00:08:37.950 --> 00:08:39.185
CARTRIDGES THAT WERE NEEDED FOR

00:08:39.252 --> 00:08:41.220
SPECIFIC MACHINES. SO WE'RE

00:08:41.287 --> 00:08:43.155
ALSO WORKING ON WITH THE

00:08:43.222 --> 00:08:44.857
MANUFACTURERS AND DISTRIBUTORS

00:08:44.924 --> 00:08:45.658
OF THOSE MACHINES AND

00:08:45.725 --> 00:08:48.227
CARTRIDGES. TO PROBLEM SOLVE

00:08:48.294 --> 00:08:49.195
THE SUPPLY CHAIN WHERE WE CUT.

00:08:49.262 --> 00:08:52.064
AND THROUGH THAT PROCESS WE

00:08:52.131 --> 00:08:53.532
DISCOVERED THAT LACK OF THE

00:08:53.599 --> 00:08:55.067
SPECIMEN COLLECTION KIDS WAS A

00:08:55.134 --> 00:08:56.969
REAL BOTTLENECK FOR THE

00:08:57.036 --> 00:08:59.639
COUNTIES SEEKING TO TEST PEOPLE

00:08:59.705 --> 00:09:00.606
THAT MAYBE THEY HAD THE

00:09:00.673 --> 00:09:01.841
INSTALLED CAPACITY OR THE

00:09:01.908 --> 00:09:04.043
ABILITY. TO DO THE PCR TEST

00:09:04.110 --> 00:09:05.945
WITH THE MACHINES. BUT THEY

00:09:06.012 --> 00:09:07.146
DIDN'T HAVE THE SPECIMEN

00:09:07.213 --> 00:09:08.948
COLLECTION KITS AND SO IT

00:09:09.015 --> 00:09:10.182
BECAME REALLY CLEAR THAT THE

00:09:10.249 --> 00:09:11.651
SUPPLY CHAIN WAS A MAJOR HURDLE

00:09:11.717 --> 00:09:12.318
IT'S SOMETHING WE'RE STILL

00:09:12.385 --> 00:09:14.053
WORKING ON WE MADE A LOT OF

00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:16.322
PROGRESS- TO SOLVE SOME OF

00:09:16.389 --> 00:09:17.290
THOSE PROBLEMS AND WE'RE

00:09:17.356 --> 00:09:18.424
GETTING A LARGE SHIPMENT OF

00:09:18.491 --> 00:09:20.126
SAID SUPPLIES FOR SPECIMEN

00:09:20.192 --> 00:09:21.994
COLLECTION KITS AND THIS WEEK.

00:09:22.061 --> 00:09:23.029
AND WILL CONTINUE TO IN THE

00:09:23.095 --> 00:09:24.964
FUTURE OF THE TESTING TASK

00:09:25.031 --> 00:09:27.199
FORCE WAS ABLE TO PROCURE SOME

00:09:27.266 --> 00:09:29.001
OF THOSE SUPPLIES DIRECTLY FOR

00:09:29.068 --> 00:09:29.869
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WE'RE

00:09:29.936 --> 00:09:31.570
ALSO THINGS. IN FROM FEMA FROM

00:09:31.637 --> 00:09:34.807
OUR FEDERAL PARTNERS- AND THEN

00:09:34.874 --> 00:09:36.676
SOME OF THE LOCAL LABORATORIES

00:09:36.742 --> 00:09:39.145
OF COURSE OUR GOAL TO CONTINUE

00:09:39.211 --> 00:09:41.347
TO. GROW UP YOUR SUPPLY. OUR

00:09:41.414 --> 00:09:42.381
OWN THROUGH THE SMALL I'M

00:09:42.448 --> 00:09:44.417
MECHANISM. ONE THING THAT

00:09:44.483 --> 00:09:48.955
BECAME AND AS WE BEGAN TO RAMP

00:09:49.021 --> 00:09:52.925
UP TESTING CALIFORNIA WHAT'S TO

00:09:52.992 --> 00:09:53.526
MAKE SURE THAT OUR CALIFORNIA.

00:09:53.592 --> 00:09:56.295
IN GUIDANCE SIXTY IT. AND THE

00:09:56.362 --> 00:09:57.229
REASON THAT SOME IS WHEN

00:09:57.296 --> 00:09:58.764
TESTING WAS SCARE. ARE FOR AND

00:09:58.831 --> 00:10:00.266
PUBLIC HEALTH WAS ON TESTING

00:10:00.333 --> 00:10:02.468
THE HIGHEST PRIORITY GROUPS.

00:10:02.535 --> 00:10:04.770
AND IS TESTING EXPANDED WE KNEW

00:10:04.837 --> 00:10:07.039
WE HAD TO EXPAND THE GUIDANCE-AND WE DID THAT AND THAT

00:10:07.106 --> 00:10:08.441
INCLUDED A SYMPTOMATIC

00:10:08.507 --> 00:10:10.910
FRONTLINE WORKERS FOR EXAMPLE

00:10:10.977 --> 00:10:11.477
THOSE WHO WORK IN A SKILLED

00:10:11.544 --> 00:10:13.045
NURSING FACILITY. SO OUR

00:10:13.112 --> 00:10:15.548
GUIDANCE HAS EXPANDED- WE KNOW

00:10:15.614 --> 00:10:16.382
THAT WE HAVE THE TESTING

00:10:16.449 --> 00:10:18.017
CAPACITY AND NOW THE GOAL IS

00:10:18.084 --> 00:10:19.852
REALLY TO EXPAND THE SPECIMEN

00:10:19.919 --> 00:10:20.953
COLLECTION SITES ACROSS THE

00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:23.990
STATE. AND I'LL TURN IT OVER TO

ABOUT A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW

00:11:42.368 --> 00:11:44.070
WE'RE EXPANDING THE SPECIMEN

00:11:44.136 --> 00:11:44.637
COLLECTION SITES ACROSS THE

00:11:44.703 --> 00:11:47.339
STATE. LAST MONTH WE WERE

00:11:47.406 --> 00:11:48.741
EXCITED TO ENTER INTO A

00:11:48.808 --> 00:11:51.577
PARTNERSHIP WITH OPTIM SIR. AND

00:11:51.644 --> 00:11:53.379
THE GOAL OF THE OPTIONS OUR

00:11:53.446 --> 00:11:55.748
RELATIONSHIP WAS TO ALLOW

00:11:55.815 --> 00:11:56.882
PRESSMAN COLLECTION SITES

00:11:56.949 --> 00:11:59.685
ACROSS THE STATE TO EXPAND. AND

00:11:59.752 --> 00:12:02.988
LOOKING AT CALIFORNIA. COOL WAS

00:12:03.055 --> 00:12:04.223
TO STRATEGICALLY PLACED SO

00:12:04.290 --> 00:12:06.392
SPECIMEN COLLECTION SITES IN

00:12:06.459 --> 00:12:07.893
THE PLACES OF GREATEST NEED AND

00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:09.495
WE ARE LOOKING AT WHAT WE CALL

00:12:09.562 --> 00:12:11.297
TESTING DESERT THAT'S NOT JUST

00:12:11.363 --> 00:12:12.798
A GEOGRAPHIC DEFINITION IT

00:12:12.865 --> 00:12:14.733
MIGHT BE IN A HIGHLY POPULATED

00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:16.335
OUR REGION THAT HAS TESTING

00:12:16.402 --> 00:12:19.238
CAPACITY BUT NOT ENOUGH AND-

00:12:19.305 --> 00:12:20.506
PEOPLE WHO AREN'T ABLE TO

00:12:20.573 --> 00:12:22.141
ACCESS IT. LOOKED AT THE MAP

00:12:22.208 --> 00:12:23.142
AND WE LOOKED AT A FEW

00:12:23.209 --> 00:12:25.744
INDICATORS- LOOKED AT POVERTY

00:12:25.811 --> 00:12:27.746
WE LOOKED AT ABILITY TO TASK

00:12:27.813 --> 00:12:30.382
RACE ETHNICITY HOW POPULOUS THE

00:12:30.449 --> 00:12:32.618
REGION WAS AND THEN WE LOOK AT

00:12:32.685 --> 00:12:33.552
DRIVING. AND SO ACROSS THE

00:12:33.619 --> 00:12:35.221
STATE WE WORKED WITH OUR

00:12:35.287 --> 00:12:37.123
COUNTIES THAT WERE IDENTIFIED.

00:12:37.189 --> 00:12:38.557
AND THE COUNTIES ARE WERE THE

00:12:38.624 --> 00:12:40.025
ONES ACTUALLY CHOOSE THE BRICK

00:12:40.092 --> 00:12:41.327
AND MORTAR LOCATION OF THE

00:12:41.393 --> 00:12:43.295
SPECIMEN COLLECTION SITES. WE

00:12:43.362 --> 00:12:44.897
MADE RECOMMENDATIONS BASED ON

00:12:44.964 --> 00:12:46.799
THE DATA THAT WE HAD- BUT THE

00:12:46.866 --> 00:12:48.167
COUNTIES ARE TRUE PARTNERS IN

00:12:48.234 --> 00:12:50.236
THIS AND ESTABLISHING ON THE

00:12:50.302 --> 00:12:52.004
LOCATION FOR THE SITE. AND

00:12:52.071 --> 00:12:53.572
OFTEN SERVED PROVIDES THE

00:12:53.639 --> 00:12:55.608
SPECIMEN COLLECTION KIT. AND

00:12:55.674 --> 00:12:57.409
HAS THE CAPACITY TO DO A

00:12:57.476 --> 00:12:58.444
HUNDRED AND THIRTY TWO TESTS

00:12:58.511 --> 00:13:00.513
PER DAY SPECIMENS COLLECTED PER

00:13:00.579 --> 00:13:03.282
DAY. AT EACH SITE. SO THAT

00:13:03.349 --> 00:13:05.351
BRINGS AND TEN THOUSAND FIVE

00:13:05.417 --> 00:13:06.385
HUNDRED AND SIXTY ADDITIONAL

00:13:06.452 --> 00:13:07.653
SPECIMEN COLLECTION KIDS IN THE

00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:10.389
CALIFORNIA. AND THE DATA SYSTEM

00:13:10.456 --> 00:13:12.358
IS INTEGRATED WITH OUR STATE

00:13:12.424 --> 00:13:14.026
DISEASE COLLECTION SYSTEM SO

00:13:14.093 --> 00:13:16.595
THAT BOTH THE COUNTY PUBLIC

00:13:16.662 --> 00:13:20.733
HEALTH DEPARTMENT AND THE STATE

00:13:20.799 --> 00:13:21.734
OF CALIFORNIA. CAN DAY AS IT

00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:25.037
COMES IN RAIL. I'M LOS BE ABLE

00:13:25.104 --> 00:13:27.106
IT HELLO LEVEL AND- THIS IS

00:13:27.173 --> 00:13:30.409
ABOUT WHAT. AND CO. THEY TO

00:13:30.476 --> 00:13:32.044
PRIORITIZE THE SITE FOR AND

00:13:32.111 --> 00:13:33.612
I'LL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE SOME

00:13:33.679 --> 00:13:36.448
COUNTIES ARE PRIORITIZING FRONT

00:13:36.515 --> 00:13:37.349
LINE HEALTH CARE WORKERS AND

00:13:37.416 --> 00:13:40.286
pLOCAL HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. TO

00:13:40.352 --> 00:13:41.787
ENSURE THAT THIS CERTAIN TIMES

00:13:41.854 --> 00:13:43.389
ARE BLOCKED OUT AT DOCTOR

00:13:43.455 --> 00:13:45.491
SERVICE SITE FOR THE FRONT AND

00:13:45.558 --> 00:13:46.892
HEALTH CARE WORKERS THEY'RE

00:13:46.959 --> 00:13:48.194
ALSO DOING MESSAGING VULNERABLE

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:50.029
COMMUNITIES THE TEACHER CLEAN

00:13:50.095 --> 00:13:52.298
PLACING THE SITE. IN LOCATIONS

00:13:52.364 --> 00:13:54.200
WHERE POPULATIONS ON THAT ARE

00:13:54.266 --> 00:13:56.335
HISTORICALLY UNDER CLOSURE MAY

00:13:56.402 --> 00:13:58.470
NOT BE ABLE TO ACCESS HEALTH.

00:13:58.537 --> 00:13:59.805
AND SO IT'S A PART THE STATE

00:13:59.872 --> 00:14:01.207
AND THE COUNTIES WITH THE GOAL

00:14:01.273 --> 00:14:03.809
OF QUICKLY SCALE AT SCALING UP-

00:14:03.876 --> 00:14:05.177
OUR ABILITY TO COLLECT

00:14:05.244 --> 00:14:08.681
SPECIMENS- WE KNOW AS SUCH A

00:14:08.747 --> 00:14:10.916
HUGE EFFORT STANDS UP. TO

00:14:10.983 --> 00:14:12.418
EIGHTY TESTING RATES OUR SPRING

00:14:12.484 --> 00:14:13.519
COLLECTION SITES WITHIN TWO

00:14:13.586 --> 00:14:15.888
WEEKS- WE KNOW THAT THIS IS

00:14:15.955 --> 00:14:17.356
THERE'S GOING TO BE THINGS THAT

00:14:17.423 --> 00:14:18.357
NEED TO BE IMPROVED IN

00:14:18.424 --> 00:14:20.559
LOCATIONS. OFTEN SERVICE

00:14:20.626 --> 00:14:22.962
WORKING HARD SAYS- TWO WEEKS OR

00:14:23.028 --> 00:14:24.363
CHANGES TO THE WAY THAT WE DO

00:14:24.430 --> 00:14:26.432
THE OPERATIONS TO ENSURE THAT

00:14:26.498 --> 00:14:28.667
IT STANDS SAFELY AND ENSURE

00:14:28.734 --> 00:14:30.402
THAT THE RIGHT DATA IS

00:14:30.469 --> 00:14:31.670
COLLECTED. AND AT THIS POINT

00:14:31.737 --> 00:14:33.339
THERE'S A AND FOUR SITES ARE

00:14:33.405 --> 00:14:35.341
ACROSS THE STATE AND WE EXPECT

00:14:35.407 --> 00:14:37.443
OUR APPLE GO UP OVER THE REST

00:14:37.509 --> 00:14:40.346
OF THIS WEEK. AND I SO WANT TO

00:14:40.412 --> 00:14:42.147
SEE ARM IT'S BEEN PARTNERS

00:14:42.214 --> 00:14:43.616
BETWEEN THE IN THE STATE OF

00:14:43.682 --> 00:14:45.851
CALIFORNIA. AND THERE CAN TO

01:09:51.287 --> 01:09:52.288
OF DIFFERENT ESSENTIAL

01:09:52.354 --> 01:09:54.957
OCCUPATION- AND IF YOU DO THE

01:09:55.024 --> 01:10:00.429
MATH ON THAT IT'S A REALLY

01:10:00.496 --> 01:10:01.063
LARGE NUMBER OF. CALLS A YOU'RE

01:10:01.130 --> 01:10:01.830
ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. WE I AM IN

01:10:01.897 --> 01:10:03.632
TESTING ON THAT FOR CON BEST TO

01:10:03.699 --> 01:10:06.035
GATE. OTHER WORDS IN ORDER TO

01:10:06.101 --> 01:10:07.202
THE BREAD AND BUTTER PUBLIC

01:10:07.269 --> 01:10:09.605
HEALTH STRATEGY OF CONTAINMENT

01:10:09.672 --> 01:10:11.273
IS TO CREATE A REALLY AREN'T

01:10:11.340 --> 01:10:13.175
ACCURATE CONTACT INVESTIGATION

01:10:13.242 --> 01:10:14.910
WHERE YOU CAN TRACK AND TRACE

01:10:14.977 --> 01:10:17.179
AND IDENTIFY ANYONE WHO IS

01:10:17.246 --> 01:10:19.415
EXPOSED AND TEST THEM AND

01:10:19.481 --> 01:10:20.215
PARTICULARLY TO THE POINT THAT

01:10:20.282 --> 01:10:22.251
YOU MAKE WITH THIS AFTER JANET

01:10:22.318 --> 01:10:25.821
CAN- HAVE THOSE ARE INFECTIOUS

01:10:25.888 --> 01:10:28.057
A SYMPTOMATIC TRACKING IN

01:10:28.123 --> 01:10:29.825
TRACING TESTING THOSE THAT MEET

01:10:29.892 --> 01:10:31.126
INFECTIOUS BASIN TO NOT A

01:10:31.193 --> 01:10:32.561
REALLY IMPORTANT. AND THAT'S

01:10:32.628 --> 01:10:33.829
WHY WE'RE WORKING ON THE TURN

01:10:33.896 --> 01:10:35.564
AROUND TIME TESTS WE KNOW THAT

01:10:35.631 --> 01:10:36.832
THERE ARE GOING TO BE

01:10:36.899 --> 01:10:39.001
ADDITIONAL TESTING MODALITIES-

01:10:39.068 --> 01:10:41.670
LET RAPID WHEN SAYING OF THE

01:10:41.737 --> 01:10:44.974
VIRUS- WE ARE NOT TO DEPLOY NOW

01:10:45.040 --> 01:10:51.280
TWICE. IN FORTY WE HIS THAT IS

01:10:51.347 --> 01:10:53.515
THAT GOING TO ABILITY IT'S HELP

01:10:53.582 --> 01:10:56.285
A SCALE ACOSTA I'M AND I THE

01:10:56.352 --> 01:10:57.519
RIGHT TURNAROUND THAT WE SO

01:10:57.586 --> 01:10:58.187
THERE'S MORE WERE TO BE DONE WE

01:10:58.253 --> 01:10:59.755
KNOW MADE SOME PROGRESS BUT WE

01:10:59.822 --> 01:11:01.557
WITH YOU THAT WE NEED TO BE

01:11:01.624 --> 01:11:03.525
FASTER AND WE NEED TO BE

01:11:03.592 --> 01:11:08.130
DEPLOYED. A QUICK FOR THOSE

01:11:08.197 --> 01:11:09.765
CONTACT INVESTIGATION. MISTER

01:11:09.832 --> 01:11:12.067
MARK ANY OUT ON THOSE. THANK

01:11:12.134 --> 01:11:13.535
YOU YES I SAY YOU KNOW I WERE.

01:11:13.602 --> 01:11:15.104
WE WOULD BE ABLE TO TAKE THE

01:11:15.170 --> 01:11:16.505
NEARLY FORTY MILLION

01:11:16.572 --> 01:11:18.741
CALIFORNIANS AND TO HAVE THEM

01:11:18.807 --> 01:11:20.943
ALL AT ONE WORST QUOTE IN A

01:11:21.010 --> 01:11:23.012
VERY CLOSE PERIOD OF TIME WITH

01:11:23.078 --> 01:11:24.613
A MEDIATOR NEAR IMMEDIATE

01:11:24.680 --> 01:11:27.049
RESULTS AND UNDERSTAND EXACTLY.

01:11:27.116 --> 01:11:28.250
WHERE THE VIRUS DID AT THAT

01:11:28.317 --> 01:11:30.986
POINT THAT WOULD BE IDEAL IT'S

01:11:31.053 --> 01:11:33.188
ALSO NOT FEASIBLE WITH THE

01:11:33.255 --> 01:11:35.424
CURRENT TECHNOLOGY AND CAPACITY

01:11:35.491 --> 01:11:38.494
AND SUPPLIES- AND SO I THINK

01:11:38.560 --> 01:11:40.729
WHAT WE HAVE DONE. YOU KNOW IN

01:11:40.796 --> 01:11:44.333
TERMS OF FINDING A DRAMATIC

01:11:44.400 --> 01:11:46.101
CARRIERS. WITH THE IN PLACE

01:11:46.168 --> 01:11:49.738
ORDERS GOING ON FOR WEEKS BUT

01:11:49.805 --> 01:11:51.807
THE SIXTY EIGHT THOUSAND AMOUNT

01:11:51.874 --> 01:11:55.310
WAS- AT A NUMBER OF COMPONENTS

01:11:55.377 --> 01:11:57.079
ONE OF WHICH IS REGULARLY

01:11:57.146 --> 01:11:59.214
CASTING PEOPLE WHO MAY HAVE

01:11:59.281 --> 01:12:01.083
EXPOSURE. LIKE FRONTLINE

01:12:01.150 --> 01:12:03.552
HEALTHCARE WORKERS. AND OR

01:12:03.619 --> 01:12:05.287
OTHER ESSENTIAL WORKERS AND

01:12:05.354 --> 01:12:08.490
KEEPING CLOSE TABS ON THEM AND

01:12:08.557 --> 01:12:10.693
THEN FINING PEOPLE WHO IF THEY

01:12:10.759 --> 01:12:12.494
HAPPEN TAX SHELTER IN PLACE.

01:12:12.561 --> 01:12:13.929
AND THERE'S TYPICALLY ABOUT A

01:12:13.996 --> 01:12:15.497
FOURTEEN DAY INCUBATION PERIOD

01:12:15.564 --> 01:12:17.766
FOR THE VIRUS BEFORE YOU START

01:12:17.833 --> 01:12:19.468
EXPERIENCING SYMPTOMS. THEN IF

01:12:19.535 --> 01:12:21.537
YOU ACTUALLY DONE THAT EVIDENCE

01:12:21.603 --> 01:12:23.505
IS THAT PEOPLE HAVE SHELTER IN

01:12:23.572 --> 01:12:24.940
PLACE THEY HAVEN'T BEEN MOVING

01:12:25.007 --> 01:12:26.742
THEN WHAT YOU DO IS YOU LOOK

01:12:26.809 --> 01:12:28.310
FOR THE PEOPLE WHO ARE. INTO

01:12:28.377 --> 01:12:29.945
MATIC LATER BECAUSE RESERVE

01:12:30.012 --> 01:12:31.914
LAID THE VAST VAST MAJORITY OF

01:12:31.980 --> 01:12:32.981
ALL OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE

01:12:33.048 --> 01:12:35.050
COMING OUT OF SHELTERING PLACE.

01:12:35.117 --> 01:12:36.351
BY THEIR ALREADY PROCESSED

01:12:36.418 --> 01:12:39.188
THROUGH. EXPERIENCING A VIRUS

01:12:39.254 --> 01:12:42.524
OR NEVER HAD IT AND SO- THAT

01:12:42.591 --> 01:12:44.393
THE THINKING BEHIND WHY THAT

01:12:44.460 --> 01:12:46.295
WOULD BE SUFFICIENT TESTING IN

01:12:46.361 --> 01:12:47.963
THE APPROACH- THAT WOULD BE

01:12:48.030 --> 01:12:50.499
TAKEN AGAIN IN THE IDEAL WORLD

01:12:50.566 --> 01:12:52.668
WE COULD BE DOING THAT'S WAY

01:12:52.735 --> 01:12:54.536
MORE BROADLY- AND WE CAN

01:12:54.603 --> 01:12:56.305
CERTAINLY POTENTIALLY EXPAND

01:12:56.371 --> 01:12:58.607
BEYOND FIFTY THOUSAND OR TRY

01:12:58.674 --> 01:13:03.312
TO. IMPROVE THE TURN AROUND

01:13:03.378 --> 01:13:05.214
TIME. I CAN'T GET EVERY NEW

01:13:05.280 --> 01:13:07.216
MIGHT BE. BACK BUT YOU HAVE TO

01:13:07.282 --> 01:13:07.783
TEST INTO POCKET IN A VERY

01:13:07.850 --> 01:13:09.251
SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. GREAT

01:13:09.318 --> 01:13:11.120
THANK AND SENATOR JACKSON DID

01:13:11.186 --> 01:13:11.920
YOU HAVE ANOTHER QUESTION

01:13:11.987 --> 01:13:14.456
YOU'RE ON MUTE. YES I WOULD I

01:13:14.523 --> 01:13:16.125
WOULD LIKE TO- I'D LIKE TO ASK

01:13:16.191 --> 01:13:17.526
A FOLLOW UP AND THEN A QUESTION

01:13:17.593 --> 01:13:19.561
ON THE PRIVACY ISSUE. SO GIVEN

01:13:19.628 --> 01:13:21.196
THE FACT THAT WE STILL DON'T

01:13:21.263 --> 01:13:22.431
HAVE THAT THE TURNOUT ISN'T

01:13:22.498 --> 01:13:24.500
THAT FAST THAT WE STILL AREN'T

01:13:24.566 --> 01:13:27.736
ABLE TO TEST. THE SIXTY OR

01:13:27.803 --> 01:13:28.270
SEVENTY THOUSAND WOULD YOU

01:13:28.337 --> 01:13:30.806
BELIEVE WOULD BE APPROPRIATE-

01:13:30.873 --> 01:13:32.708
AND ONE OF THE OPTIONS THAT

01:13:32.775 --> 01:13:35.077
QUESTIONS WHY THAT NUMBER WHAT

01:13:35.144 --> 01:13:37.045
DOES THAT TELL YOU- GIVEN THAT

01:13:37.112 --> 01:13:38.547
THE FACT THAT THE- THING ISN'T

01:13:38.614 --> 01:13:41.884
ADEQUATE. YET DAD THE TURN TIME

01:13:41.950 --> 01:13:45.254
IS SO LOW WHY WHY DO YOU THINK

01:13:45.320 --> 01:13:48.524
THAT WE ARE. IN A POSITION TO

01:13:48.590 --> 01:13:50.893
MOVE ON TO THE SECOND PHASE IF

01:13:50.959 --> 01:13:52.728
WE DON'T HAVE ADEQUATE.

01:13:52.795 --> 01:13:56.064
ATTESTING TO MEET THOSE-

01:13:56.131 --> 01:13:58.967
PRELIMINARY OR BASED A QUESTION

01:13:59.034 --> 01:14:01.170
AS TO WHO. I IS INFECTED AND

01:14:01.236 --> 01:14:05.941
WHO IS POTENTIALLY TRANSMIT THE

01:14:06.008 --> 01:14:09.311
DISEASE. THANK YOU SENATOR

01:14:09.378 --> 01:14:11.580

AND THEN IF MY COLLEGE STUDENT

01:14:29.097 --> 01:14:30.165
DALY WANTS TO JUMP IN ABOUT

01:14:30.232 --> 01:14:31.867
THAT TRACK AND TRACE EFFORTS-

01:14:31.934 --> 01:14:35.637
PLEASE DO- SO LET ME START WITH

01:14:35.704 --> 01:14:36.371
THE OFFICE YOU QUESTION OF HOW

01:14:36.438 --> 01:14:38.173
DID WE ARRIVE AT THAT NUMBER WE

01:14:38.240 --> 01:14:40.108
WRITE THAT NUMBER A FEW

01:14:40.175 --> 01:14:41.743
DIFFERENT WAYS. AND EVERYONE'S

01:14:41.810 --> 01:14:43.512
DOING MATH TRYING TO CALCULATE

01:14:43.579 --> 01:14:45.380
WHAT THE NUMBER METRICUS. AND

01:14:45.447 --> 01:14:47.082
WE IS THE STATE HAVE NOT GIVEN

01:14:47.149 --> 01:14:48.283
OUT A RECOMMENDATION TO

01:14:48.350 --> 01:14:51.019
COUNTIES OF WHAT THEIR- ON.

01:14:51.086 --> 01:14:54.122
METRIC IS ON A WHOLE BUT THAT.

01:14:54.189 --> 01:14:55.157
WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT IS THE

01:14:55.224 --> 01:14:57.326
NUMBER OF COHORTS OF PEOPLE

01:14:57.392 --> 01:14:58.994
THAT WE NEED TO BE TESTED SO

01:14:59.061 --> 01:15:00.262
MISTER MARK OF IT SHOULD WORK

01:15:00.329 --> 01:15:01.830
FOR YOU. ON YOU KNOW ESSENTIAL

01:15:01.897 --> 01:15:03.432
WORKERS FRONTLINE HEALTHCARE

01:15:03.498 --> 01:15:06.034
WORKERS ON SAFETY OFFICERS AT

01:15:06.101 --> 01:15:07.169
CENTER AND SO FEW OUT OF THOSE

01:15:07.236 --> 01:15:08.704
GROUPS AND THEN YOU LOOK AT THE

01:15:08.770 --> 01:15:10.205
FREQUENCY. WITH WHICH THEY

01:15:10.272 --> 01:15:11.707
WOULD NEED TO BE TESTED AND

01:15:11.773 --> 01:15:13.609
THEN YOU DIVIDE OVER TIME. YOU

01:15:13.675 --> 01:15:16.378
COME TO AROUND THE SIXTY TO

01:15:16.445 --> 01:15:18.981
EIGHTY THOUSAND DIAGNOSTIC ON

01:15:19.047 --> 01:15:20.148
PCR TEST DAY. THERE ARE SOME

01:15:20.215 --> 01:15:21.583
INTERESTING IS THAT HAVE BEEN

01:15:21.650 --> 01:15:22.784
PUBLISHED. ON THAT THE

01:15:22.851 --> 01:15:24.519
GOVERNOR'S MANSION WAS DONE BY

01:15:24.586 --> 01:15:29.491
WERE THAT DID YOU ASK FOR.

01:15:29.558 --> 01:15:30.359
THOUSAND PER DAY JUST ONE THERE

01:15:30.425 --> 01:15:31.293
ARE STILL OTHERS. SO THAT'S HOW

01:15:31.360 --> 01:15:34.162
ARRIVED AT THE NUMBER. I WILL

01:15:34.229 --> 01:15:36.298
ALSO SHARE THAT. TESTING IS

01:15:36.365 --> 01:15:38.066
JUST ONE PART OF THE STRATEGY

01:15:38.133 --> 01:15:39.635
THAT CONTINUING TO PHYSICAL

01:15:39.701 --> 01:15:41.236
DISTANCE AND IMPLEMENT SOCIAL

01:15:41.303 --> 01:15:44.273
DISTANCING- WHERE POSSIBLE AND

01:15:44.339 --> 01:15:45.841
FOLLOWING THE RECOMMENDATIONS

01:15:45.908 --> 01:15:46.875
FROM LOCAL HEALTH OFFICIALS

01:15:46.942 --> 01:15:49.044
REGARDING. MASS GATHERINGS OR

01:15:49.111 --> 01:15:50.212
RESTAURANTS YOU KNOW FOLLOWING

01:15:50.279 --> 01:15:54.049
THE SEQUENTIAL RESPONSIBLE AND-

01:15:54.116 --> 01:15:58.420
I. LIFTING FIVE SOME OF THOSE.

01:15:58.487 --> 01:16:00.055
MEASURE IS A RISK THE WAY TO

01:16:00.122 --> 01:16:01.189
APPROACH THIS BECAUSE TESTING

01:16:01.256 --> 01:16:02.958
IS IMPORTANT BUT IT'S NOT THE

01:16:03.025 --> 01:16:04.826
ONLY THING. YOU NEED TO

01:16:04.893 --> 01:16:06.361
PRACTICE THE GOOD HYGIENE IN

01:16:06.428 --> 01:16:09.164
THE PHYSICAL DISTANCING- IT IS

01:16:09.231 --> 01:16:11.066
IT IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO YOU

01:16:11.133 --> 01:16:14.102
AND WE KNOW THE AS INCREASE

01:16:14.169 --> 01:16:16.038
SEROLOGY TESTING IS BEING DONE

01:16:16.104 --> 01:16:17.572
AND FORMS WHAT PERCENTAGE OF

01:16:17.639 --> 01:16:19.574
THE POPULATION MAY HAVE ALREADY

01:16:19.641 --> 01:16:21.510
BEEN A IN FACT IT. ON THAT

01:16:21.576 --> 01:16:24.179
HELPS TO FORM WHAT WE DO BUT

01:16:24.246 --> 01:16:25.414
AND SO WE HAVE BETTER SEROLOGY

01:16:25.480 --> 01:16:27.215
TESTING THAT ARE RELIABLE AND A

01:16:27.282 --> 01:16:31.253
DIAGNOSTIC LEVEL AND ON A-

01:16:31.320 --> 01:16:32.354
BASIS IN CALIFORNIA. WE NEED

01:16:32.421 --> 01:16:34.656
CONTINUE TO BE VERY SLOW AND

01:16:34.723 --> 01:16:36.458
VERY THOUGHTFUL ABOUT LIFTING

01:16:36.525 --> 01:16:38.260
ANY OF THOSE- ANY THE STATURE

01:16:38.327 --> 01:16:39.828
AND THE MEASURES THAT ARE PUT

01:16:39.895 --> 01:16:44.433
IN PLACE FOR SOCIAL DISTANCING

01:16:44.499 --> 01:16:45.033
AND PHYSICAL DISTANCING. AND

01:16:45.100 --> 01:16:46.635
OUR GOAL IS TO HAVE TO. BY THE

01:16:46.702 --> 01:16:48.670
AT EIGHT THAT WE FEEL THERE'S

01:16:48.737 --> 01:16:51.473
ADEQUATE DIAGNOSTIC PCR TESTING

01:16:51.540 --> 01:16:54.743
TO SUPPORT ON THE COUNTIES

01:16:54.810 --> 01:16:56.311
TRACK AND TRACE EFFORTS. THANK

01:16:56.378 --> 01:16:57.612
YOU DOCTOR DEAN AND JUST DO A

01:16:57.679 --> 01:16:59.481
QUICK TIME CHECK WITH ABOUT

01:16:59.548 --> 01:17:00.382
FIVE MORE SENATORS AFTER

01:17:00.449 --> 01:17:01.149
SENATOR JACKSON'S SO JUST

IS THIS IS A QUESTION ON

01:17:08.824 --> 01:17:10.492
PRIVACY THAT WAS RAISED-

01:17:10.559 --> 01:17:14.096
PREVIOUSLY BY SENATOR BATES- AS

01:17:14.162 --> 01:17:17.165
WE- HAVE ADVANCED AND WE HAVE

I THINK WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO BE.

01:29:39.107 --> 01:29:41.109

COLLECTION SITE. IT IS NOT A

01:29:48.583 --> 01:29:50.651
GREAT SOLUTION. BECAUSE OF FOR

01:29:50.718 --> 01:29:52.186
A WHOLE HOST OF REASONS THAT WE

01:31:29.717 --> 01:31:30.685
WORRIED ABOUT. AND THIS IS WHAT

01:31:30.751 --> 01:31:31.419
ONE OF THE CHALLENGES WITH

01:31:31.485 --> 01:31:32.386
RURAL ALWAYS BELIEVE IT'S

01:31:32.453 --> 01:31:34.055
BECAUSE OF THE ACTION. IS THERE

01:31:34.121 --> 01:31:36.457
LEFT BEHIND. I DON'T WANT THAT

01:31:36.524 --> 01:31:38.659
TO HAPPEN ESPECIALLY SINCE THIS

01:31:38.726 --> 01:31:41.062
IS AT THE STAKES ARE SO HIGH SO

01:31:41.128 --> 01:31:43.764
IF OUR- SO CALLED SOLVING FORT

01:31:43.831 --> 01:31:46.167
STRATEGY IS SIMPLY SAID IT'S AN

01:31:46.234 --> 01:31:48.669
IMPASSE. AND HAVING THEM GO OUT

01:31:48.736 --> 01:31:50.204
AND RURAL COMMUNITIES THAT

01:31:50.271 --> 01:31:50.838
DOESN'T WORK BECAUSE THEY DON'T

01:31:50.905 --> 01:31:52.807
HAVE EMPLOYEES. SO WHAT I WOULD

01:31:52.874 --> 01:31:55.009
HOPE IS SOLVING FOR IT MEANS

01:31:55.076 --> 01:31:57.578
THEY GET EQUITABLE TREATMENT.

01:31:57.645 --> 01:31:58.479
THAT WE ARE PROVIDING FOR THE

01:31:58.546 --> 01:32:00.448
REST OF THE STATE AND AGAIN. I

CONTINUE DISCUSSING- THE ISSUE

01:32:28.309 --> 01:32:30.111
OF WHETHER IT'S BASED ON REGION

01:32:30.177 --> 01:32:32.313
AND OF COURSE- WE'RE STARTING

01:32:32.380 --> 01:32:34.248
NOW WITH TESTING BUT THE- THE-

01:32:34.315 --> 01:32:36.017
EXPECTATION WOULD BE THAT WE-

01:32:36.083 --> 01:32:36.817
OF COURSE. RECEIVE SOME

01:32:36.884 --> 01:32:39.320
ANSWERS- TO ENSURE WERE MOVING

01:32:39.387 --> 01:32:40.821
TOWARD THE STRATEGY IN PLAN

01:32:40.888 --> 01:32:42.623
THAT FITS- EVERYONE OF OUR

01:32:42.690 --> 01:32:44.792
COMMUNITIES AT DIFFERENTLY SO

01:32:44.859 --> 01:32:45.993
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT

01:32:46.060 --> 01:32:48.329

FOR YOUR HARD WORK AND ALSO OUR

01:32:59.173 --> 01:33:00.474
PUBLIC HEALTH. OFFICERS AS

01:33:00.541 --> 01:33:02.944
WELL- I KNOW YOU WORKING HARD

01:33:03.010 --> 01:33:05.246
TO. PROTECT PEOPLE IN YOUR

01:33:05.313 --> 01:33:07.181
COUNTIES IN ACROSS CALIFORNIA

01:33:07.248 --> 01:33:08.849
IF YOU ARE SEVERAL QUESTIONS

01:33:08.916 --> 01:33:10.851
ARE STARTING OFF WITH TESTING-

01:33:10.918 --> 01:33:13.087
SO PCR TESTING IS THE CURRENT

01:33:13.154 --> 01:33:14.655
GOLD STANDARD WE KNOW THAT

01:33:14.722 --> 01:33:15.890
THERE ARE SOME CHALLENGES THE

01:33:15.957 --> 01:33:19.427
NATURE OF THE VIRUSES THAT

01:33:19.493 --> 01:33:21.062
ACTUALLY. THIS THE VIRUS NEWS

01:33:21.128 --> 01:33:23.264
FROM THE NASOPHARYNX DOWN TO

01:33:23.331 --> 01:33:24.432
THE LUNGS- DEPENDING ON WHEN

01:33:24.498 --> 01:33:26.467
YOU DO IS THE SAMPLE COLLECTION

01:33:26.534 --> 01:33:27.802
YOU MAY OR MAY NOT ACTUALLY

01:33:27.868 --> 01:33:30.338
TAKE UP THE VIRUS. GIVEN THE

01:33:30.404 --> 01:33:33.307
VIRAL LOAD. SO I CERTAINLY

01:33:33.374 --> 01:33:35.409
UNDERSTAND THIS EMPHASIS ONPCR

01:33:35.476 --> 01:33:37.545
TESTING- BUT AS WE'RE MOVING

01:33:37.611 --> 01:33:39.347
FORWARD ARE YOU LOOKING AYE

01:33:39.413 --> 01:33:41.182
COMBINATION STRATEGY NO THERE'S

01:33:41.248 --> 01:33:42.149
LIMITATIONS ON THE CURRENT

01:33:42.216 --> 01:33:43.684
STRATEGY TASK. BUT THE MORE

01:33:43.751 --> 01:33:45.353
ACTUALLY IDENTIFY WHO ACTUALLY

01:33:45.419 --> 01:33:48.589
IS BOTH CURRENTLY INFECTED. AS

01:33:48.656 --> 01:33:50.091
WELL AS WHO MIGHT HAVE THE

01:33:50.157 --> 01:33:52.259
DISEASE AND I KNOW THEY'RE

01:33:52.326 --> 01:33:53.761
STILL QUESTION MARK. WHAT DOES

01:33:53.828 --> 01:33:55.029
YOUR ALREADY TEST REALLY MEAN

01:33:55.096 --> 01:33:56.430
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT LEVEL AND A

01:33:56.497 --> 01:33:58.532
BODY ACTUALLY RESULTS IN AN

01:33:58.599 --> 01:34:01.335
ACTUAL ARE. ET SO THAT IS A

01:34:01.402 --> 01:34:03.704
STILL OPEN QUESTION IN SCIENCE-

01:34:03.771 --> 01:34:05.406
SO WE DON'T KNOW THAT BUT SAME

01:34:05.473 --> 01:34:08.576
TIME YEAH WE DO PCR TESTING.

01:34:08.642 --> 01:34:10.411
AND THEN- WE KNOW THAT THE

01:34:10.478 --> 01:34:12.113
VIRAL LOAD CHANGES OVER TIME

01:34:12.179 --> 01:34:13.848
AND SO WE MAY NOT IN FACT I

01:34:13.914 --> 01:34:14.582
THINK THERE'S SOME INDICATIONS

01:34:14.648 --> 01:34:16.984
THAT THE- SENSITIVITIES ONLY

01:34:17.051 --> 01:34:19.020
70% FOR NASAL FRAGILE SLAPS FOR

01:34:19.086 --> 01:34:21.889
PCR. AND SO IS THERE A STRATEGY

01:34:21.956 --> 01:34:23.657
THINK ABOUT COMBINATION TESTING

01:34:23.724 --> 01:34:26.227
ASTROLOGY AND YOU SEE ARE TO

01:34:26.293 --> 01:34:29.430
TRY TO GET A BETTER HANDLE ON.

01:34:29.497 --> 01:34:30.998
IT ACTUALLY IS POSITIVE KNOWING

01:34:31.065 --> 01:34:33.234
THAT'S RELATIVE COURSE TAKES

01:34:33.300 --> 01:34:35.236
ABOUT EIGHT DAYS FOR FROM TIME

01:34:35.302 --> 01:34:37.238
EXPOSURE TO SEE SOME ANTIBODY

01:34:37.304 --> 01:34:38.439
PRODUCTION OR SOMETHING EVEN

01:34:38.506 --> 01:34:39.607
PICKED UP SO I REALIZE THESE

01:34:39.673 --> 01:34:40.441
ARE SOMEWHAT TECHNICAL

01:34:40.508 --> 01:34:41.909
QUESTIONS BUT- ULTIMATELY

01:34:41.976 --> 01:34:43.811
POLICY WHY SCORE WE LANDING IN

01:34:43.878 --> 01:34:44.945
TERMS OF TRYING TO BE SURE WE

01:34:45.012 --> 01:34:46.213
CAN DOWN A FLIGHT. IS TRULY

01:34:46.280 --> 01:34:50.184
POSITIVE AND HAVE A BETTER

01:34:50.251 --> 01:34:52.853
ASSET RESULTS. YES DOCTOR DEAN.

01:34:52.920 --> 01:34:54.488
YES THANK YOU DOCTOR PLAN FOR

01:34:54.555 --> 01:34:57.425
THAT QUESTION- WE HAVE NOT-

01:34:57.491 --> 01:34:59.860
ISSUED A GUIDANCE OR A POLICY

01:34:59.927 --> 01:35:01.295
FOR SPECIFIC GROUPS THAT SHOULD

01:35:01.362 --> 01:35:02.863
BE GETTING A SPECIFIC TYPE OF

01:35:02.930 --> 01:35:04.131
SEROLOGY TASK BECAUSE WE'RE

01:35:04.198 --> 01:35:06.067
STILL. LOOKING IN WANTING TO

01:35:06.133 --> 01:35:07.902
SEE- VALIDATION OF SOME OF

01:35:07.968 --> 01:35:10.204
THOSE TESTS- THE GOOD NEWS IS

01:35:10.271 --> 01:35:13.240
WE DID- PROACTIVELY IS AS AS

01:35:13.307 --> 01:35:14.675
THE STATE PURCHASE ONE POINT

01:35:14.742 --> 01:35:15.810
FIVE MILLION TESTS OF THE NEW

01:35:15.876 --> 01:35:17.478
ABBOTT SEROLOGY TEST SO THOSE

01:35:17.545 --> 01:35:18.779
ARE COMING INTO CALIFORNIA

01:35:18.846 --> 01:35:19.947
RIGHT NOW. IT STARTED TO SHIP

01:35:20.014 --> 01:35:21.649
IN THE STATE LAST WEEK AND

01:35:21.715 --> 01:35:22.783
THERE'S A RUN ON THE ARCHITECT

01:35:22.850 --> 01:35:24.085
MACHINE WHICH IS THE MACHINE

01:35:24.151 --> 01:35:25.553
THAT MANY HOSPITALS I THINK

01:35:25.619 --> 01:35:27.188
OVER A HUNDRED AND SIXTY AYE

01:35:27.254 --> 01:35:28.889
MACHINES ARE IN CALIFORNIA. ON

01:35:28.956 --> 01:35:30.257
THEY BELIEVE THE TURN AROUND

01:35:30.324 --> 01:35:32.126
TIME ON THAT TEST IS AROUND

01:35:32.193 --> 01:35:33.394
THREE TO FOUR HOURS- BUT WE

01:35:33.461 --> 01:35:34.361
THOUGHT THAT WAS A REALLY

01:35:34.428 --> 01:35:35.529
IMPORTANT MOVE FOR CALIFORNIA

01:35:35.596 --> 01:35:36.864
BECAUSE WE WANTED TO SEE AN

01:35:36.931 --> 01:35:38.766
INCREASE IN SEROLOGY TEST. WELL

01:35:38.833 --> 01:35:40.868
WE'RE STILL CAUTIOUS- ABOUT

01:35:40.935 --> 01:35:42.269
RECOMMENDING THAT AND BEING

01:35:42.336 --> 01:35:44.538
USED IN ANY SPECIFIC GROUP. WE

01:35:44.605 --> 01:35:46.607
DO KNOW THAT MANY ON MANY OF

01:35:46.674 --> 01:35:47.675
OUR LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS

01:35:47.741 --> 01:35:49.777
ARE LOOKING AT USING THEM AND-

01:35:49.844 --> 01:35:51.045
CONJUNCTION WITH PCR TESTING.

01:35:51.112 --> 01:35:53.047
YOU'LL SEE OUR NEW UPDATED

01:35:53.114 --> 01:35:54.482
GUIDANCE ON A KNOWLEDGE IS THAT

01:35:54.548 --> 01:35:56.750
IN SAYING ON PCR TESTING WITH

01:35:56.817 --> 01:35:59.587
OR WITHOUT SEROLOGY. I'M AWARE

01:35:59.653 --> 01:36:01.122
THAT A NUMBER OF GROUPS ARE

01:36:01.188 --> 01:36:02.523
LAUNCHING STUDIES A COUPLINGS

01:36:02.590 --> 01:36:03.924
AS YOU SAID COUPLING UP THE PCR

01:36:03.991 --> 01:36:06.026
TESTING WITH SEROLOGY. AND

01:36:06.093 --> 01:36:08.028
HOPEFULLY WILL HELP EDUCATE US

01:36:08.095 --> 01:36:10.464
ON HOW AND WHERE. CAN BEST BE

01:36:10.531 --> 01:36:15.202
USED. I'M TO THE POINT ABOUT

01:36:15.269 --> 01:36:15.803
THAT SENSITIVITY IS BEST. SEE

01:36:15.870 --> 01:36:21.275
OUR- THE WHAT'S BEEN INTEREST.

01:36:21.342 --> 01:36:22.543
THE TESTS WERE SOME OF THEM ARE.

01:36:22.610 --> 01:36:23.511
IMPEDE SEASONING SOME OF THEM

01:36:23.577 --> 01:36:24.879
ARE THE UP CAN'T. THEY CAN

01:36:24.945 --> 01:36:26.680
SPEAK MORE TECHNICAL BUT WHAT

01:36:26.747 --> 01:36:28.249
THEY FOUND IN SOME OF THEIR IN

01:36:28.315 --> 01:36:30.050
HOUSE VALIDATION IS THAT THE

01:36:30.117 --> 01:36:31.986
TRADITIONAL PC ARE. ON MAY HAVE

01:36:32.052 --> 01:36:33.487
A SENSITIVITY AND SPECIFICITY

01:36:33.554 --> 01:36:35.523
AS HIGH AS NINETY SEVEN AND

01:36:35.589 --> 01:36:36.857
NINETY NINE PERCENT. I WHICH IS

01:36:36.924 --> 01:36:38.759
VERY GOOD. AND ESPECIALLY AS WE

01:36:38.826 --> 01:36:41.095
LOOK AT NEW TESTING MODALITIES-

01:36:41.162 --> 01:36:42.863
FOR EXAMPLE SOME OF THE NEW

01:36:42.930 --> 01:36:43.664
TESTING MODALITIES ARE

01:36:43.731 --> 01:36:46.033
SWAPPING. I'M INTO YOUR NARES

01:36:46.100 --> 01:36:47.001
OR THE FRONT OF THE NOSE WHICH

01:36:47.067 --> 01:36:49.470
IS A SELF WHAT. WE'RE WATCHING

01:36:49.537 --> 01:36:51.472
NOT THE DATA THAT'S COMING OUT

01:36:51.539 --> 01:36:53.174
ON THAT CAREFULLY. TO SEE WHAT

01:36:53.240 --> 01:36:55.242
WORKABLE- OPERATOR ERROR OR

01:36:55.309 --> 01:36:57.178
SELF SWABBING PLAYS WHEN YOU

01:36:57.244 --> 01:36:58.078
RUN AND THEN ON THE TRADITIONAL

01:36:58.145 --> 01:37:00.247
PC OUR MACHINE KNOWING THAT

01:37:00.314 --> 01:37:02.082
THAT SENSITIVITY AND

01:37:02.149 --> 01:37:04.118
SPECIFICITY IS PRETTY GOOD. SO

01:37:04.185 --> 01:37:05.219
I AGREE WITH YOU CONCERN ABOUT

01:37:05.286 --> 01:37:07.121
ME SEVEN EASIER POSITIVE MAYBE

01:37:07.188 --> 01:37:08.422
WE GOT THEM A FEW DAYS LATER OR

01:37:08.489 --> 01:37:09.857
TO YOUR POINT THAT THE VIRAL

01:37:09.924 --> 01:37:11.358
LOAD CAN VERY AND THEN NEEDS A

01:37:11.425 --> 01:37:12.459
FRIEND JAIL OR A FRIEND YOU'RE

01:37:12.526 --> 01:37:15.396
ALL FAIRINGS- WE- WERE LOOKING

01:37:15.462 --> 01:37:17.765
AT THAT. THERE'S IN SOME WAYS

01:37:17.831 --> 01:37:22.203
IT'S NOT. CAN I KNOW ABLE RISK

01:37:22.269 --> 01:37:23.103
WHEN YOU'RE DOING THOSE KIND OF

01:37:23.170 --> 01:37:23.737
SWABS THAT YOU'RE GOING TO MISS

01:37:23.804 --> 01:37:24.605
CERTAIN. OF PEOPLE THAT ARE.

01:37:24.672 --> 01:37:25.573
AND JUST YOU'RE NOT DETECTING

01:37:25.639 --> 01:37:27.675
THE VIRUS SO. I'M INTERESTED IN

01:37:27.741 --> 01:37:29.810
SEEING MORE DATA ON SEROLOGY

01:37:29.877 --> 01:37:31.212
TESTING IS IT IMPROVES BUT LIKE

01:37:31.278 --> 01:37:32.947
I SAID WE PURCHASED ONE POINT

01:37:33.013 --> 01:37:35.349
FIVE MILLION TESTS ARE VERY

01:37:35.416 --> 01:37:35.950
SUPPORTIVE OF THAT RAMPING UP

01:37:36.016 --> 01:37:40.054
IN CALIFORNIA. AND I'M SORRY

01:37:40.120 --> 01:37:45.192
WHAT WAS THE SECOND QUESTION.

01:37:45.259 --> 01:37:47.695
OKAY THANK YOU- SO NO PRE SHEET

01:37:47.761 --> 01:37:49.129
THAT ANSWER I MEAN I THINK YOU

01:37:49.196 --> 01:37:50.531
WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE SINCE

01:37:50.598 --> 01:37:52.166
THE SPECIFICITY I THINK SOME OF

01:37:52.233 --> 01:37:54.068
THAT AGAIN IT'S NOT THE TESTING

01:37:54.134 --> 01:37:56.237
TECHNIQUE IT'S THE ABILITY TO

01:37:56.303 --> 01:37:57.972
DETECT AND- SO WHAT BE

01:37:58.038 --> 01:37:58.939
INTERESTED IN LOOKING AT SOME

01:37:59.006 --> 01:37:59.974
OF THE DATA THAT YOU TALKED

01:38:00.040 --> 01:38:01.375
ABOUT I KNOW ANOTHER CHANNEL

01:38:01.442 --> 01:38:03.711
TALKS. SO KISSING ON THAT. IN

01:38:03.777 --> 01:38:05.579
RELATION TERMS OF THE ACTUAL.

01:38:05.646 --> 01:38:07.481
GETTING THE TESTING SO FOR

YOUR COMMITMENT TO. HELPING THE

01:54:59.592 --> 01:55:01.828
STATE OVERCOME THIS DEADLY

01:55:01.894 --> 01:55:03.463
DISEASE- ONLY YOU KNOW WE

01:55:03.529 --> 01:55:04.530
REALLY HAVEN'T FOCUSED ONTHIS

01:55:04.597 --> 01:55:05.832
ISSUE BUT I WANT TO MENTION IT

01:55:05.898 --> 01:55:08.334
BECAUSE- IN MY DISTRICT THIS IS

01:55:08.401 --> 01:55:09.769
A BEEN A REALLY IMPORTANT

01:55:09.836 --> 01:55:11.771
QUESTION WHICH IS THAT-

01:55:11.838 --> 01:55:13.506
EVERYBODY THAT NEEDS TO GET

01:55:13.573 --> 01:55:16.209
TESTED CAN GET TESTED- AND I

01:55:16.276 --> 01:55:17.610
AND I MEAN THAT IN TERMS OF

01:55:17.677 --> 01:55:18.845
WHETHER YOU HAVE INSURANCE AND

01:55:18.911 --> 01:55:20.647
WHETHER YOU'RE IN DOCUMENTED-

01:55:20.713 --> 01:55:22.415
THAT IS REALLY IMPORTANT THAT

01:55:22.482 --> 01:55:24.317
UP. THE STATE WANTS TO MAKE THE

01:55:24.384 --> 01:55:25.918
RESOURCES AVAILABLE AND I THINK

01:55:25.985 --> 01:55:28.154
THAT'S REALLY SIGNIFICANT- AND

01:55:28.221 --> 01:55:29.489
I ALSO WANT TO SUPPORT AN

01:55:29.555 --> 01:55:30.823
ASSOCIATE MYSELF WITH THE

01:55:30.890 --> 01:55:31.758
COMMENTS THAT WERE MADE BY

01:55:31.824 --> 01:55:33.860
SENATOR MCGUIRE REGARDING RURAL

01:55:33.926 --> 01:55:37.230
COMMUNITIES- MY DISTRICT IS A

01:55:37.297 --> 01:55:38.931
RURAL COMMUNITY AND SOME OF THE

01:55:38.998 --> 01:55:41.634
SOME OF THE CONCERNS WELL SOME

01:55:41.701 --> 01:55:43.169
OF THE ISSUES THERE'S A LACK OF

01:55:43.236 --> 01:55:45.271
INFORMATION ON THE TESTING-

01:55:45.338 --> 01:55:47.140
MODALITIES AND HOW THEY WORK.

01:55:47.206 --> 01:55:48.975
AND WHETHER RURAL CALIFORNIA IS

01:55:49.042 --> 01:55:52.111
ACTUALLY GOING TO SEE THE

01:55:52.178 --> 01:55:53.546
SOPHISTICATED TESTS COME

01:55:53.613 --> 01:55:54.914
THROUGH. IT'S GOING TO BE

01:55:54.981 --> 01:55:57.583
IMPORTANT- IS IT NOT ONLY THAT

01:55:57.650 --> 01:55:59.385
THE TESTING SITES BE AVAILABLE

01:55:59.452 --> 01:56:01.321
BUT ALSO THAT THE- QUICKER

01:56:01.387 --> 01:56:04.757
TESTS- ARE AVAILABLE TO THEM AS

01:56:04.824 --> 01:56:06.092
WELL AND THERE'S ALREADY A

01:56:06.159 --> 01:56:09.996
SENSE ON THAT. AT THE-

01:56:10.063 --> 01:56:12.098
DISTRIBUTION OF RESOURCES HE IS

01:56:12.165 --> 01:56:14.567
NOT- DOES NOT TAKE INTO

01:56:14.634 --> 01:56:15.635
CONSIDERATION SOME OF THE

01:56:15.702 --> 01:56:16.969
ISSUES IN RURAL CALIFORNIA AND

01:56:17.036 --> 01:56:18.338
THAT- THEY'RE NOT GETTING THEIR

01:56:18.404 --> 01:56:20.006
FAIR SHARE SO THAT THIS SENSE

01:56:20.073 --> 01:56:21.841
THAT IT'S NOT FAIR IS ALREADY

01:56:21.908 --> 01:56:24.277
OUT THERE- BUT WHAT I WANT TO

01:56:24.344 --> 01:56:26.245
DO IS I WANT TO TALK ABOUT-

01:56:26.312 --> 01:56:29.449
DATA COLLECTION. AND DAM AND

01:56:29.515 --> 01:56:31.451
JUST GET A SENSE OF WHETHER YOU

01:56:31.517 --> 01:56:33.252
WERE COLLECTING THE RIGHT KIND

01:56:33.319 --> 01:56:34.887
OF DATA TO GET BACK TO SOME OF

01:56:34.954 --> 01:56:36.489
THEM THE COMMENTS THAT WERE

01:56:36.556 --> 01:56:39.892
MADE BY SENATOR JACKSON- YOU

01:56:39.959 --> 01:56:41.194
KNOW THE DATA BECOMES REALLY

01:56:41.260 --> 01:56:43.262
IMPORTANT AND FOR LOOKING AT.

01:56:43.329 --> 01:56:45.231
WHO CAN OPEN AND HOW QUICKLY

01:56:45.298 --> 01:56:48.201
AND IN WHERE WE'RE SEEING THE

01:56:48.267 --> 01:56:52.572
DISEASE- MANIFEST ITSELF AND-

01:56:52.638 --> 01:56:54.173
THAT THE WHOLE ISSUE WITH

01:56:54.240 --> 01:56:55.475
MAKING SURE THAT WERE

01:56:55.541 --> 01:56:57.110
IDENTIFYING THE LGBT COMMUNITY

01:56:57.176 --> 01:56:59.045
IS REALLY IMPORTANT. BUT ALSO

01:56:59.112 --> 01:57:01.748
HOUSING CONDITIONS BECOME VERY

01:57:01.814 --> 01:57:04.851
IMPORTANT IN MANY OF MY- IN IN

01:57:04.917 --> 01:57:06.586
MANY OTHER PARTS OF MY DISTRICT

01:57:06.652 --> 01:57:08.287
HOUSING OVERCROWDING IS

01:57:08.354 --> 01:57:10.523
SIGNIFICANT AND YOU HAVE MANY

01:57:10.590 --> 01:57:13.126
ON RELATED INDIVIDUALS THAT

01:57:13.192 --> 01:57:16.028
RENT- THE UNITS. THE OCCUPATION

01:57:16.095 --> 01:57:17.463
BECOMES REALLY IMPORTANT TO

01:57:17.530 --> 01:57:21.601
PARTICULARLY AS WE LOOK AT- THE

01:57:21.667 --> 01:57:25.204
M. EMPLOYMENT SITUATION WHICH

01:57:25.271 --> 01:57:27.507
IS YEAH IN AGRICULTURE MANY

01:57:27.573 --> 01:57:28.641
TIMES PEOPLE ARE WORKING ON

01:57:28.708 --> 01:57:30.276
MACHINES AND THEY REQUIRE YOU

01:57:30.343 --> 01:57:32.011
TO STAND SHOULDER TO SHOULDER.

01:57:32.078 --> 01:57:34.347
AND SO- THERE'S THE POTENTIAL

01:57:34.414 --> 01:57:38.184
FOR- THE THAT THE SPREAD OF THE

01:57:38.251 --> 01:57:39.652
VIRUS IN THOSE KINDS OF

01:57:39.719 --> 01:57:43.423
SITUATIONS- AND ALSO A QUESTION

01:57:43.489 --> 01:57:46.492
AS TO. WHY WE ARE USING

01:57:46.559 --> 01:57:48.127
SENTENCE TRACK INSTEAD OF

01:57:48.194 --> 01:57:50.763
IDENTIFYING- IT IS CITIES

01:57:50.830 --> 01:57:52.265
BECAUSE MANY OF OUR SENSES

01:57:52.331 --> 01:57:53.299
TRUCKS ESPECIALLY IN RURAL

01:57:53.366 --> 01:57:55.468
CALIFORNIA- INVOLVES COUNTY AND

01:57:55.535 --> 01:57:57.804
INCORPORATED PROPERTY WITH- A

01:57:57.870 --> 01:58:01.541
VERY DENSE CITY URBAN TYPE OF

01:58:01.607 --> 01:58:03.676
DEVELOPMENT AND THE DATA IS

01:58:03.743 --> 01:58:06.312
LIKELY TO BE SKEWED WE'VE SEEN

01:58:06.379 --> 01:58:07.980
THIS OVER THE YEARS WITH. ON

01:58:08.047 --> 01:58:10.716
DEMOGRAPHIC DATA BETTY ITS

01:58:10.783 --> 01:58:13.319
COLOR BY THIS MADE THAT THAT

01:58:13.386 --> 01:58:15.054
REALLY DOESN'T TELL YOU WHAT'S

01:58:15.121 --> 01:58:16.289
GOING ON IN THE COMMUNITY AND

01:58:16.355 --> 01:58:18.458
SO- THOSE WITH THOSE ISSUES

01:58:18.524 --> 01:58:19.859
BECOME REALLY IMPORTANT TO ME

01:58:19.926 --> 01:58:22.395
AND THEN FINALLY AT THE AT AS A

01:58:22.462 --> 01:58:25.198
KIND OF A POINT. IS THAT. I

01:58:25.264 --> 01:58:26.799
HAVE A QUESTION IT'S A FIRST

01:58:26.866 --> 01:58:29.101
TIME TODAY THAT WE'VE HAD A

01:58:29.168 --> 01:58:32.071
DISCUSSION ABOUT. LEAVING

01:58:32.138 --> 01:58:34.707
ISSUES UP TO THE COUNTIES. TO

01:58:34.774 --> 01:58:36.075
THE PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT

01:58:36.142 --> 01:58:40.012
TO- TO REGULATE FOR LACK OF A

01:58:40.079 --> 01:58:42.315
BETTER WORD- SOME OF THE

01:58:42.381 --> 01:58:44.250
CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH PEOPLE.

01:58:44.317 --> 01:58:46.886
ESSENTIAL WORKERS SHOULD BE.

01:58:46.953 --> 01:58:48.921
PROTECTED AND I SAY THAT

01:58:48.988 --> 01:58:50.823
BECAUSE I HAVE SIX DISTRICTS AS

01:58:50.890 --> 01:58:52.925
PART OF MY SIX COMPANIES AS

01:58:52.992 --> 01:58:54.193
PART OF MY DISTRICT AND EACH

01:58:54.260 --> 01:58:55.495
COUNTY DID SOMETHING A LITTLE

01:58:55.561 --> 01:58:56.829
BIT DIFFERENT IN REGARDS TO

01:58:56.896 --> 01:58:59.131
FARMWORKERS. AND WHETHER

01:58:59.198 --> 01:59:00.199
EMPLOYERS SHOULD PROVIDE

01:59:00.266 --> 01:59:02.401
PROTECTIVE. EQUIPMENT WHERE

01:59:02.468 --> 01:59:04.637
THEIR- THERE WAS THERE WERE

01:59:04.704 --> 01:59:05.805
REQUIREMENTS ABOUT HOW THEY

01:59:05.872 --> 01:59:08.274
WERE TO GET TO WORK MANY OF

01:59:08.341 --> 01:59:10.409
THEM COMMUTE TOGETHER AND NOT

01:59:10.476 --> 01:59:13.246
AND WHETHER THE AND EDUCATION-

01:59:13.312 --> 01:59:15.281
PROGRAM PRIOR TO STARTING

01:59:15.348 --> 01:59:17.416
EMPLOYMENT BECOMES IMPORTANT

01:59:17.483 --> 01:59:19.485
WHETHER IT'S A GOOD THING TO

01:59:19.552 --> 01:59:22.655
HAVE A- TEMPERATURE- TAKEN

01:59:22.722 --> 01:59:24.690
BEFORE THEY GO. BEGIN TO WORK

01:59:24.757 --> 01:59:26.225
IT JUST DIFFERENT THINGS THAT

01:59:26.292 --> 01:59:29.495
THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN BENEFICIAL

01:59:29.562 --> 01:59:31.130
TO HAVE STARTED SOME TIME AGO

01:59:31.197 --> 01:59:32.698
AND TO HAVE THAT THE DIFFERENT

01:59:32.765 --> 01:59:33.933
COUNTIES DOING DIFFERENT THINGS

IF WE CAN JUST- ELABORATE ON

02:02:14.994 --> 02:02:17.663
THAT A BIT MORE- BECAUSE I KNOW

02:02:17.730 --> 02:02:19.098
MANY OF OUR ESSENTIAL WORKERS

02:02:19.165 --> 02:02:21.967

02:02:22.034 --> 02:02:24.170

THINKING ABOUT TESTING OF

02:02:38.684 --> 02:02:40.853
ESSENTIAL WORKERS AND ON THE

02:02:40.920 --> 02:02:42.121
ONE OF THE CHALLENGES IS IT

02:02:42.188 --> 02:02:43.556
THERE HAD THEIR SIMPLY HASN'T

02:02:43.622 --> 02:02:45.991
BEEN ENOUGH TESTING CAPACITY ON

02:02:46.058 --> 02:02:47.059
TO DO THE LEVEL THAT WE WOULD

02:02:47.126 --> 02:02:49.161
LIKE. TO DO AS WAS MENTIONED

02:02:49.228 --> 02:02:51.464
EARLIER YOU KNOW BECAUSE THIS

02:02:51.530 --> 02:02:52.398
VIRUS IS SPREAD ISN'T A

02:02:52.465 --> 02:02:53.999
SYMPTOMATIC THESE ARE PEOPLE

02:02:54.066 --> 02:02:55.835
THAT DON'T HAVE SYMPTOMS THE

02:02:55.901 --> 02:02:56.969
POINT THAT YOU MADE ABOUT

02:02:57.036 --> 02:02:59.205
PEOPLE THAT LIVE IN CONGREGATE

02:02:59.271 --> 02:03:01.407
SETTINGS OR- APARTMENTS TO LIVE

02:03:01.474 --> 02:03:03.042
IN VERY CLOSE PROXIMITY TO EACH

02:03:03.109 --> 02:03:04.844
OTHER ON THAT THAT'S A RISK

02:03:04.910 --> 02:03:05.845
FACTOR FOR SPREADING THE

02:03:05.911 --> 02:03:07.413
DISEASE. SO AS WE THINK ABOUT

02:03:07.480 --> 02:03:09.315
TESTING- ESSENTIAL WORKERS

02:03:09.381 --> 02:03:10.816

FOURTEEN DAYS- THAT'S NOT AN

02:03:21.594 --> 02:03:23.662
OFFICIAL GUIDANCE PER SE BUT

02:03:23.729 --> 02:03:24.730
THAT'S KIND OF A BENCHMARK

02:03:24.797 --> 02:03:26.265
THAT'S BEING USED OF HOW OFTEN

02:03:26.332 --> 02:03:28.534
SOMEONE THAT HAS- A HIGH RISK

02:03:28.601 --> 02:03:31.170
FOR EXPOSURE. WHAT WOULD BE A

02:03:31.237 --> 02:03:32.638
REASONABLE A PERIOD OF TIME TO

02:03:32.705 --> 02:03:35.374
RETEST THEM- IF CASTING WAS

02:03:35.441 --> 02:03:36.642

AROUND YOU KNOW WHAT WE DO WITH

02:07:41.153 --> 02:07:43.255

02:07:43.322 --> 02:07:44.390
HEARD THE SAME THING IN TERMS

02:07:44.456 --> 02:07:47.793
OF PEOPLE NOT REALLY WANTING. I

02:07:47.860 --> 02:07:49.728
BELIEVE IT IT MAY GO BACK TO

02:07:49.795 --> 02:07:51.096
OUR COMMENTS THAT WERE MADE

02:07:51.163 --> 02:07:53.132
EARLIER ABOUT IT BUT THEY

02:07:53.198 --> 02:07:55.000
ABOUT- YOU KNOW WHETHER NOT YOU

02:07:55.067 --> 02:07:56.568
FOR FREE TO GET IT AND WHAT

02:07:56.635 --> 02:07:58.437
WHAT HAPPENED WITH THAT- WE

02:07:58.504 --> 02:08:00.406
WERE IF I UNDERSTAND CORRECTLY-

02:08:00.472 --> 02:08:01.306
AS THEY WERE IMPLEMENTING

02:08:01.373 --> 02:08:03.876
PROJECT FROM YOU YOU OFFER.

02:08:03.942 --> 02:08:05.444
LOCATIONS BURKE YOU BOTH THE

02:08:05.511 --> 02:08:09.448
COME OFF OF THE STREET AND THE

02:08:09.515 --> 02:08:10.249
HOUSE THEY WERE OFFERING THAT.

02:08:10.315 --> 02:08:12.751
AS WELL BUT THAT PARTICULAR AND-

02:08:12.818 --> 02:08:13.352
A PERSON WHO WOULD AFFECT THE

02:08:13.419 --> 02:08:14.353
POP BUT THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN.

02:08:14.420 --> 02:08:16.288
IN A LOCATION WHERE THEY COULD

02:08:16.355 --> 02:08:18.957
HAVE BEEN ISOLATED. IN ORDER TO

02:08:19.024 --> 02:08:20.592
PREVENT THEM SPREADING OTHERS.

02:08:20.659 --> 02:08:22.594
I THINK YOU KNOW WE HAVE TO

02:08:22.661 --> 02:08:24.096
REALLY LOOK CLOSELY AT WHAT

02:08:24.163 --> 02:08:25.397
OTHER POTENTIAL ON AND IS THERE

02:08:25.464 --> 02:08:28.300
MIGHT BE. IN THAT REGARD. WE

02:08:28.367 --> 02:08:30.269
HAVE HAD A STRONG EFFORT TO TRY

02:08:30.335 --> 02:08:33.105
TO. GET PEOPLE WHO ARE RENTING

02:08:33.172 --> 02:08:34.807
ALMOST THAT INTO EITHER A

02:08:34.873 --> 02:08:36.475
SHELTER LOCATION OR HOUSING

02:08:36.542 --> 02:08:38.644
LOCATION. IN RDER TO PUT THEM

02:08:38.710 --> 02:08:40.212
IN AN ENVIRONMENT THAT ALLOWS

02:08:40.279 --> 02:08:42.047
THEM TO HAVE ACCESS TO THE

02:08:42.114 --> 02:08:43.415
FACILITIES FOR HAND WASHING

02:08:43.482 --> 02:08:45.551
BETTER. EFFECT I THINK THAT ARE

02:08:45.617 --> 02:08:48.520
NEEDED TO PREVENT THAT. I AM

02:08:48.587 --> 02:08:51.590
PREVENT- GETTING THE FILM WHILE.

02:08:51.657 --> 02:08:52.591
BUT I THINK. WE HAVE A LOT MORE

02:08:52.658 --> 02:08:53.225
WORK TO DO TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT

02:08:53.292 --> 02:08:54.793
HOW TO. MAKE THAT ARE

02:08:54.860 --> 02:08:56.595
COMFORTABLE DECISION BUT THOSE

02:08:56.662 --> 02:08:57.563
ARE EXPENSE AND ALMOST THAT.

02:09:06.839 --> 02:09:09.007
GO BACK TO THE DATA QUESTION. I

02:09:09.074 --> 02:09:10.943
THINK THERE ARE THINGS THAT ARE

02:09:11.009 --> 02:09:11.910
MANDATED IN TERMS OF STATE

02:09:11.977 --> 02:09:14.847

IN THERE HAVE TO BE A BETTER

02:09:18.083 --> 02:09:19.485
MAPPING OF THE- I TYPICALLY

02:09:19.551 --> 02:09:21.420

FROM THE HOSPITAL- BUT I CAN'T

02:09:26.125 --> 02:09:28.861

THE TERMS OF THOSE

02:09:32.030 --> 02:09:33.632
REQUIREMENTS. THE CITY IS NOT

02:09:33.699 --> 02:09:35.067

TERMS OF STATE RIGHT. ALSO

02:09:38.804 --> 02:09:39.705
THERE NEED TO BE FROM CHANGES

02:09:39.771 --> 02:09:41.440

02:09:49.681 --> 02:09:50.349
THINK THAT THERE ARE MECHANISMS

THERE. ARE YOU WOULD HAVE TO

02:09:52.050 --> 02:09:53.185

02:13:39.144 --> 02:13:41.646
COMPLY CLIA CERTIFIED LABS LIKE

02:13:41.713 --> 02:13:43.048
THOSE CRESCENT UNIVERSITIES

02:13:43.115 --> 02:13:48.820
LIKE UCSD. TO DEVELOP- DID

02:13:48.887 --> 02:13:50.455
NINETEEN DIAGNOSTIC TESTING

02:13:50.522 --> 02:13:51.456
MAINLY TALKING ABOUT THAT YOU

02:13:51.523 --> 02:13:53.658
SEE ARE FAST WHICH IS THE

02:13:53.725 --> 02:13:55.260
DIAGNOSTIC TESTS THE DOCTOR

02:13:55.327 --> 02:13:57.796
CHARITY IN WAS DISGUSTING YEAH.

02:13:57.863 --> 02:13:59.197
I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY

02:13:59.264 --> 02:14:01.566
SOMETHING SO HIGH COMPLEXITY

02:14:01.633 --> 02:14:03.969
CLIA CERTIFIED LAB IS WE RUN BY

02:14:04.035 --> 02:14:05.804
A BOARD CERTIFIED PATHOLOGIST

02:14:05.871 --> 02:14:06.872
OR SOMEBODY WITH THE BALLOT

02:14:06.938 --> 02:14:09.107
GETS TRAINING IT HAS A VERY

02:14:09.174 --> 02:14:10.442
VERY COMPLICATED SERIES OF

02:14:10.509 --> 02:14:11.910
REQUIREMENTS IN ORDER TO

02:14:11.977 --> 02:14:14.346
PROVIDE. DIAGNOSTICS HOSPITAL

02:14:14.413 --> 02:14:17.182
ESTATE THERE ALSO TEST OUT

02:14:17.249 --> 02:14:19.317
DIFFERENT TYPE OF LAB FACILITY

02:14:19.384 --> 02:14:23.388
WHICH IS CALLED- CLEO WAIT AND

02:14:23.455 --> 02:14:24.589
THAT ALLOWS MORE SIMPLIFIED

02:14:24.656 --> 02:14:26.792
TESTING SO THE- POINT IS BEEN

02:14:26.858 --> 02:14:28.827
RAISED WITH REGARD TO WHY NOT

02:14:28.894 --> 02:14:31.897
INCORPORATE PHARMACIES. INTO

02:14:31.963 --> 02:14:34.232
THE TESTING. OUR TESTING

02:14:34.299 --> 02:14:35.767
PORTFOLIO IN THE STATE I WOULD

02:14:35.834 --> 02:14:38.203
SUGGEST THAT MOST PHARMACIES

02:14:38.270 --> 02:14:40.238
THAT YOU ON SITE TESTING OR

02:14:40.305 --> 02:14:42.874
CLEAR AWAY. AT MOST OF THE

02:14:42.941 --> 02:14:45.410
TESTING THAT THE FDA ALLOWS

02:14:45.477 --> 02:14:46.545
UNDER EMERGENCY USE

02:14:46.611 --> 02:14:48.413
AUTHORIZATION AND FDA APPROVAL

02:14:48.480 --> 02:14:50.615
NOW THAT DOES THE TESTING

02:14:50.682 --> 02:14:52.150
MACHINES THE HIGH THROUGHPUT

02:14:52.217 --> 02:14:53.819
THINGS THAT WE USE ARE ARE HIGH

02:14:53.885 --> 02:14:56.388
COMPLEXITY SO I'LL TALK I CAN

02:14:56.455 --> 02:14:57.556
AND I CAN ADDRESS THAT IN MORE

02:14:57.622 --> 02:15:00.158
DETAIL BUT- THERE IS. A LITTLE

02:15:00.225 --> 02:15:01.793
BIT OF A PROBLEM WITH REGARD

02:15:01.860 --> 02:15:03.829
THE TECHNOLOGY NEEDED AND HOW

02:15:03.895 --> 02:15:05.897
WE DO IT MY PERSONAL VISION AND

02:15:05.964 --> 02:15:07.165
I COMPLETELY AGREE THAT WE NEED

02:15:07.232 --> 02:15:09.334
TO EXPAND TO RURAL AREAS WE

02:15:09.401 --> 02:15:16.708
NEED TO EXTEND TO PLACES. WHERE

02:15:16.775 --> 02:15:17.909
FARMWORKERS MAY BE. LIVING JUST

02:15:17.976 --> 02:15:20.212
STATE YOU. AND MY- PREFERENCE

02:15:20.278 --> 02:15:24.749
BE TO HOW WE- FASTER. AND GET

02:15:24.816 --> 02:15:25.484
TO UP YOU KNOW WELL PREPARED OR

02:15:25.550 --> 02:15:27.552
TO SO THIS GIVES YOU AN IDEA

02:15:27.619 --> 02:15:30.055
WITHIN NINE DAYS OF THE FDA

02:15:30.121 --> 02:15:32.290
GUIDANCE ARMORY TWENTY NINE THE

02:15:32.357 --> 02:15:34.693
LAST DAYS OF THE DAY OFF- BUT

02:15:34.759 --> 02:15:37.028
YOU SEE ES DE ONE WHY WITH THIS

02:15:37.095 --> 02:15:39.564
FIRST DIAGNOSTIC TEST. ALL FIVE

02:15:39.631 --> 02:15:41.733
CAMPUSES THAT DIAGNOSTIC TESTS

02:15:41.800 --> 02:15:43.869
WITHIN- WITHIN A WEEK OF THAT

02:15:43.935 --> 02:15:46.104
DAY. AND THIS SHOWS YOU WHAT

02:15:46.171 --> 02:15:48.306
OUR CURRENT CAPACITY IS THE PCR

02:15:48.373 --> 02:15:50.308
TEST OUR THREE PUT HER DAY IF

02:15:50.375 --> 02:15:51.776
YOU READ THIS OUT. IT'S YOU

02:15:51.843 --> 02:15:54.513
KNOW. COMING UP ON TEN THOUSAND

02:15:54.579 --> 02:15:56.448
TEST PER DAY WE WORK IS THE

02:15:56.515 --> 02:15:57.449
SYSTEM WE CAN GREEN IS THE

02:15:57.516 --> 02:16:01.386
SYSTEM DISCUSS. OUR PROBLEMS

02:16:01.453 --> 02:16:02.487
AND ISSUES. AND I WILL ALSO

02:16:02.554 --> 02:16:04.055
SUGGESTS THAT I HAVE A LITTLE

02:16:04.122 --> 02:16:05.423
BIT OF A DIFFERENT OPINION

02:16:05.490 --> 02:16:07.692
BECAUSE I THINK. WE NEED TO

02:16:07.759 --> 02:16:09.294
THINK IN TERMS OF CASTING

02:16:09.361 --> 02:16:12.864
STRATEGY AND TECHNOLOGY. AND

02:16:12.931 --> 02:16:14.399
THE PROBLEM IN MY MIND IS

02:16:14.466 --> 02:16:16.401
EVOLVING FROM ONE IN WHICH GOAL

02:16:16.468 --> 02:16:18.103
WE NEED MORE TESTS WE NEED MORE

02:16:18.169 --> 02:16:21.206
TESTS TO. WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND

02:16:21.273 --> 02:16:23.208
THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAYS TO USE

02:16:23.275 --> 02:16:25.510
OUR CATS BECAUSE I WILL TELL

02:16:25.577 --> 02:16:28.780
YOU THAT OF THIS MAJOR CAPACITY

02:16:28.847 --> 02:16:30.081
YOU SEE IN THE UC SYSTEM. WE

02:16:30.148 --> 02:16:32.684
DON'T USE A LARGE PERCENTAGE OF

02:16:32.751 --> 02:16:34.386
IT AS MUCH AS 50% OF THOSE

02:16:34.452 --> 02:16:36.154
TESTS THAT WE COULD BE DOING

02:16:36.221 --> 02:16:38.223
WERE NOT PERFORMING. AND ONE I

02:16:38.290 --> 02:16:39.824
WAS ONCE ASKED WHY NOT STEVE IS

02:16:39.891 --> 02:16:40.859
THAT WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH

02:16:40.926 --> 02:16:42.827
PATIENTS DESPITE AN AGGRESSIVE.

02:16:42.894 --> 02:16:45.830
OUTREACH PROGRAM WE ALL OFFER

02:16:45.897 --> 02:16:50.001
SEROLOGY NOW. AND I KNOW- WE'VE

02:16:50.068 --> 02:16:52.137
ALREADY HEARD SOME DEBATE ABOUT.

02:16:52.203 --> 02:16:54.205
THE USEFULNESS OF SEROLOGY. ARE

02:16:54.272 --> 02:16:55.974
WE GONNA TALK FOLLOWING ME AN

02:16:56.041 --> 02:16:57.909
EXPERT USER OLOGY I WOULD JUST

02:16:57.976 --> 02:17:00.011
SAY MY OPINION IS I AM AN

02:17:00.078 --> 02:17:02.113
OPTIMIST. I'M A BELIEVER A WHAT

02:17:02.180 --> 02:17:03.448
WE CALL THE MEMORY B.

02:17:03.515 --> 02:17:05.617
LYMPHOCYTE I THINK THE PROBLEM

02:17:05.684 --> 02:17:08.219
WITH THIS VIRUS. IS NOBODY'S

02:17:08.286 --> 02:17:10.221
BEEN EXPOSED TO IT SO WE'RE ALL

02:17:10.288 --> 02:17:12.357
WE SEE OPEN NINETEEN WE'RE LIKE

02:17:12.424 --> 02:17:13.925
INSTANCE WITHOUT THE BENEFIT OF

02:17:13.992 --> 02:17:16.494
MOTHER'S MILK. AND SO IT'S A

02:17:16.561 --> 02:17:18.330
COMPLETELY BRAND NEW CHALLENGE

02:17:18.396 --> 02:17:20.699
TO OUR IMMUNE SYSTEM. ONCE

02:17:20.765 --> 02:17:21.833
YOU'VE RECOVERED AND YOU WILL

02:17:21.900 --> 02:17:24.302
HAVE POSITIVE SEROLOGY IT IS

02:17:24.369 --> 02:17:25.704
ABSOLUTELY TRUE WE DON'T KNOW

02:17:25.770 --> 02:17:27.539
TO WHAT EXTENT. THAT MEANS YOUR

02:17:27.606 --> 02:17:29.341
IMMUNE WILL YOU GET IT AGAIN

02:17:29.407 --> 02:17:31.910
HOW LONG WITH THAT I HE LAST

02:17:31.977 --> 02:17:33.645
BUT I DO THINK THAT SHOWING

02:17:33.712 --> 02:17:35.614
THAT SOMEBODY AS A POSITIVE

02:17:35.680 --> 02:17:40.051
STRATEGIES. DECISIONS ALONG

02:17:40.118 --> 02:17:41.987
WITH THAT. THE UC. A BY THE WAY

02:17:42.053 --> 02:17:43.622
I IT WAS SENATOR DODD SPOKE

02:17:43.688 --> 02:17:45.223
ABOUT AN ANTIGEN TEST THAT'S

02:17:45.290 --> 02:17:46.825
DIFFERENT THAN AN ANTIBODY

02:17:46.891 --> 02:17:48.994
TEST. ANTIGEN TESTS ARE

02:17:49.060 --> 02:17:51.196
DETECTING PROTEINS ASSOCIATED

02:17:51.262 --> 02:17:52.631
BUYER SO SUPPOSED TO BE ARE IN

02:17:52.697 --> 02:17:54.199
A WHICH IS WHAT WE DO YOU SEE

02:17:54.265 --> 02:17:57.402
OUR- IT IS ANOTHER WAY. TO

02:17:57.469 --> 02:17:59.004
DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT

02:17:59.070 --> 02:18:00.672
SOMEBODY IS ACTIVELY INSPECTED

02:18:00.739 --> 02:18:02.641
AT THE TIME. I WILL SAY THAT IN

02:18:02.707 --> 02:18:04.709
MY LAB AT UCSD OUR TURNAROUND

02:18:04.776 --> 02:18:06.745
ON PCR IS LESS THAN TWENTY FOUR

02:18:06.811 --> 02:18:08.246
HOURS INCLUDING THE TIME

02:18:08.313 --> 02:18:09.981
REQUIRED TO GET SAMPLES FROM

02:18:10.048 --> 02:18:12.050
OUR COLLECTION CENTERS WHICH

02:18:12.117 --> 02:18:13.418
INCLUDE DRIVE THROUGH CENTERS

02:18:13.485 --> 02:18:15.720
NEED TO CREATED. INTO THE LAB

02:18:15.787 --> 02:18:18.390
AND TO REPORT THE RESULTS SO I

02:18:18.456 --> 02:18:20.659
THINK RAPID TURNAROUND TIME IS

02:18:20.725 --> 02:18:22.761
VERY VERY IMPORTANT. I HAD ON

02:18:22.827 --> 02:18:24.062
THE TABLE I DIDN'T TALK ABOUT

02:18:24.129 --> 02:18:29.300
IT THE ABBOTT ID NOW SYSTEM.

02:18:29.367 --> 02:18:30.135
SPOKE ABOUT THAT THAT'S

02:18:30.201 --> 02:18:31.903
ACTUALLY GO BACK THE ABBOTT ID

02:18:31.970 --> 02:18:33.505
SYSTEM YOU SEE WE'RE USING

02:18:33.571 --> 02:18:36.007
THAT. THAT IS A ONE HOUR TURN

02:18:36.074 --> 02:18:37.876
AROUND TIME THAT'S ALSO WHAT

02:18:37.942 --> 02:18:40.478
YOU CALL CLEO WADE. SO THAT

02:18:40.545 --> 02:18:42.647
COULD BE USED IN THE PHARMACY

02:18:42.714 --> 02:18:45.750
OR LOW COMPLEXITY LABORATORY

02:18:45.817 --> 02:18:48.153
IT'S A LOS THROUGH. ALREADY IT

02:18:48.219 --> 02:18:50.722
IS FDA APPROVED FOR USE IN

02:18:50.789 --> 02:18:53.058
DETERMINING MY LAB FOR ME TO DO

02:18:53.124 --> 02:18:55.193
IT. WE HAVE THE CAPACITY TO DO

02:18:55.260 --> 02:18:56.728
ABOUT A HUNDRED CASPER DAY

02:18:56.795 --> 02:18:58.930
USING THIS SYSTEM. ABBOTT I

02:18:58.997 --> 02:19:00.331
DON'T KNOW IF THEY COULD MAKE

02:19:00.398 --> 02:19:02.133
ENOUGH MACHINES TO DO WHAT

02:19:02.200 --> 02:19:03.902
CALIFORNIA WOULD LIKE TO DO AND

02:19:03.968 --> 02:19:05.470
DOCTOR DEAN SPOKE ABOUT THE

02:19:05.537 --> 02:19:08.106
FACT THAT YES. THE SENSITIVITY

02:19:08.173 --> 02:19:09.741
OF THAT ASSET A IS A LITTLE BIT

02:19:09.808 --> 02:19:11.810
LOWER THAN THE SENSITIVITY OF

02:19:11.876 --> 02:19:13.678
OUR HIGH THROUGHPUT PLATFORMS

02:19:13.745 --> 02:19:15.747
LIKE THE ROCHE AND THE ABIT A

02:19:15.814 --> 02:19:16.948
QUICK MINUTE THAT WE USE

02:19:17.015 --> 02:19:18.883
STANDARD LEE HERE USED TO GET

02:19:18.950 --> 02:19:20.251
STATE. WITH REGARD TO

02:19:20.318 --> 02:19:27.325
SENSITIVITY I'LL JUST SAY YES.

02:19:27.392 --> 02:19:28.993
THE VIRUS DOES. TO YOUR LONG.

02:19:29.060 --> 02:19:30.261
BUT USING THE ROCHE DID IT INTO

02:19:30.328 --> 02:19:31.596
IN THE PEACE ARE. ASKED SAY

02:19:31.663 --> 02:19:33.231
THAT WE YOU. WE GET THE CAT AS

02:19:33.298 --> 02:19:34.265
AS LOW AS HUNDRED TWO HUNDRED.

02:19:34.332 --> 02:19:36.868
OF THAT SIX. SO WHEN. YOU THE

02:19:36.935 --> 02:19:39.003
PROBLEM WITH DETECTING AS I

02:19:39.070 --> 02:19:40.538
ALWAYS SAY LOOK IF THE VIRUS IS

02:19:40.605 --> 02:19:42.907
ON THE SPOT. WE CAN SEE IF WE

02:19:42.974 --> 02:19:44.576
CAN DETECT IT. THAT DOESN'T

02:19:44.642 --> 02:19:45.877
MEAN YOU PUT THE SWAB IN THE

02:19:45.944 --> 02:19:47.479
RIGHT PLACE CLINICALLY STICK

02:19:47.545 --> 02:19:49.047
OUT YOU ARE UP TO DOES IN HIS

02:19:49.114 --> 02:19:49.981
BRAIN TISSUE THAT'S NOT OUR

02:19:50.048 --> 02:19:51.916
FAULT EITHER. BUT IN FACT THE

02:19:51.983 --> 02:19:54.052
ASSET HAS A GREAT ANALYTICAL

02:19:54.119 --> 02:19:56.855
SENSITIVITY. AND DOCTOR DEAN

02:19:56.921 --> 02:19:58.556
WAS CORRECTED IN DESCRIBING THE

02:19:58.623 --> 02:20:00.692
ANTIBODY TEST. LITTLE BIT LESS

02:20:00.759 --> 02:20:02.260
SENSITIVITY AND THERE'S SOME

02:20:02.327 --> 02:20:04.763
ARE. HALF OLOGY MATHEMATICS

02:20:04.829 --> 02:20:07.132
INVOLVED IN THAT SO WHAT WE

02:20:07.198 --> 02:20:08.666
DOING IN OUR REGION THIS IS.

02:20:08.733 --> 02:20:10.034
YOU KNOW WE'RE UNIVERSITY

02:20:10.101 --> 02:20:12.003
HOSPITAL THE OTHER FOUR

02:20:12.070 --> 02:20:16.708
CAMPUSES UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL. A

02:20:16.775 --> 02:20:17.909
REAL SHOUT OUT. CHIU UCSF.

02:20:17.976 --> 02:20:19.244
BECAUSE THANKS TO THE TRANS

02:20:19.310 --> 02:20:21.346
UPPER BURKE INITIATIVE THEY GOT

02:20:21.412 --> 02:20:23.181
A GRANT THAT ALLOWS THEM TO

02:20:23.248 --> 02:20:24.249
PROVIDE TESTING ABSOLUTELY

02:20:24.315 --> 02:20:26.417
FREE. TO EVERYBODY WHO NEEDS IT

02:20:26.484 --> 02:20:28.119
I THINK THAT'S FANTASTIC IT IS

02:20:28.186 --> 02:20:29.921
TO BE USED MORE OFTEN. WE'VE

02:20:29.988 --> 02:20:31.689
TRIED REACHING OUT AND WE HAVE

02:20:31.756 --> 02:20:32.924
REACHED OUT TO STILL NURSING

02:20:32.991 --> 02:20:34.559
WRIST THIS A LOT EASIER TO USE

02:20:34.626 --> 02:20:37.395
UCSD. WE HAVE A PROGRAM CHEST

02:20:37.462 --> 02:20:39.330
FIRST RESPONDERS YOU'VE REACHED

02:20:39.397 --> 02:20:41.299
OUT AND THAT WE ARE TESTING

02:20:41.366 --> 02:20:43.168
PEOPLE ON HOMELESS FACILITIES.

02:20:43.234 --> 02:20:44.869
UP WE'VE MAY OVERFLOW TESTING

02:20:44.936 --> 02:20:46.337
AVAILABLE TO OUR MEN'S HEALTH

02:20:46.404 --> 02:20:47.405
SERVICES THE REGIONAL

02:20:47.472 --> 02:20:49.140
LABORATORIES WE SERVE SMALL

02:20:49.207 --> 02:20:51.776
HOSPITALS. WE SUPPORT THE BA

02:20:51.843 --> 02:20:53.411
WITH ALL OF THAT AGAIN WITH

02:20:53.478 --> 02:20:55.079
THEIR CAPACITY AT FIFTEEN

02:20:55.146 --> 02:20:56.581
HUNDRED ON AVERAGE. ABOUT SIX

02:20:56.648 --> 02:21:00.418
HUNDRED. BUT HER DATE- I AM

02:21:00.485 --> 02:21:01.753
PERSONALLY CONCERNED I'VE BEEN

02:21:01.820 --> 02:21:03.288
QUOTED IN THE LOCAL NEWSPAPER

02:21:03.354 --> 02:21:05.323
SAYING BUT I TOTALLY BELIEVE.

02:21:05.390 --> 02:21:06.724
YOU CST SHOULD HAVE

02:21:06.791 --> 02:21:08.026
RESPONSIBILITY FOR EVERY HUMAN

02:21:08.092 --> 02:21:09.594
BEING FROM THE MEXICAN BORDER

02:21:09.661 --> 02:21:11.696
UP THROUGH RIVERSIDE. AND I

02:21:11.763 --> 02:21:13.731
THINK EVERY HOSPITAL THE UC

02:21:13.798 --> 02:21:17.001
SYSTEM IS THERE. TO TAKE ON

02:21:17.068 --> 02:21:19.103
REGION'S AND WE CAN'T SUPPORT.

02:21:19.170 --> 02:21:21.172
AND WE'RE AVAILABLE JUST WHAT

02:21:21.239 --> 02:21:23.608
WE ARE STATE ASSETS. I WILL SAY

02:21:23.675 --> 02:21:24.909
I'M VERY YOU KNOW I THINK IT

02:21:24.976 --> 02:21:26.978
WAS CENTER MCGUIRE SPOKE ABOUT

02:21:27.045 --> 02:21:29.647
YOU KNOW BEING ABLE TO ACCESS

02:21:29.714 --> 02:21:35.286
REACH RURAL COMMUNITIES. AND I

02:21:35.353 --> 02:21:39.724
AM. FAMILIAR WITH THE OPTIMIST

02:21:39.791 --> 02:21:41.593
TESTING I MAYBE THE A TO THIS

02:21:41.659 --> 02:21:43.595
AND WE'RE ON RIGHT NOW ALONG

02:21:43.661 --> 02:21:44.896
WITH A LOT OF OTHER PLACES.

02:21:44.963 --> 02:21:46.364
WE'RE WORKING ON WAYS THAT

02:21:46.431 --> 02:21:48.333
PATIENTS CAN SELF REQUIRE

02:21:48.399 --> 02:21:50.368
SPECIMENS PEOPLE ARE WORKING ON

02:21:50.435 --> 02:21:53.304
SALIVA AND THEN THERE IS A- A

02:21:53.371 --> 02:21:54.706
TEST THAT YOU CAN USE THAT YOU

02:21:54.772 --> 02:21:55.907
DON'T HAVE TO PUT ALL THE WAY

02:21:55.974 --> 02:21:57.509
UP YOUR NOSE TO YOUR THROAT SO

02:21:57.575 --> 02:21:58.509
WHAT HEALTH PROFESSIONAL

02:21:58.576 --> 02:22:00.578
DOESN'T HAVE TO DO THAT EVEN IF

02:22:00.645 --> 02:22:02.513
THAT SUPERVISED BY A HEALTH

02:22:02.580 --> 02:22:03.481
PROFESSIONAL LIKE WE'RE

02:22:03.548 --> 02:22:05.016
CONSIDERING. THE HEALTH

02:22:05.083 --> 02:22:06.317
PROFESSIONAL DOESN'T HAVE TO

02:22:06.384 --> 02:22:08.319
CHANGE PROTECTIVE CLOTHING IN

02:22:08.386 --> 02:22:10.622
BETWEEN EVERY CASTLES THAT IS A

02:22:10.688 --> 02:22:12.757
WAY TO GET SAMPLES FROM MORE

02:22:12.824 --> 02:22:17.195
DISTANT SITES. TO STRONG

02:22:17.262 --> 02:22:18.296
TESTING CENTERS WHETHER IT'S

02:22:18.363 --> 02:22:21.399
THE UC SYSTEM HOSPITAL OR QUEST

02:22:21.466 --> 02:22:23.067
OR SOME OTHER LARGE FACILITY

02:22:23.134 --> 02:22:24.369
WITH GREAT RAPID TURNAROUND

02:22:24.435 --> 02:22:26.871
TESTING AND WE HAVE ALL KINDS

02:22:26.938 --> 02:22:28.706
OF WAYS PRE ON A LITTLE COOL

02:22:28.773 --> 02:22:30.675
THANK YOU DOCTOR ON IS THANK

THANK YOU VERY MUCH I'M SURE

02:22:37.949 --> 02:22:39.417
WHAT WE CAN GET BACK TO

02:22:39.484 --> 02:22:40.585
ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS AFTER THE

02:22:40.652 --> 02:22:42.921
PANEL- AND ADDITIONAL THOUGHTS

02:22:42.987 --> 02:22:46.691
THERE THANK YOU VERY MUCH- NEXT

MY NAME IS ALAN WILL AND I'M A

02:23:12.617 --> 02:23:15.320
LABORATORY MEDICINE. FASTER AT

02:23:15.386 --> 02:23:17.221
UCSF WHICH IS ONE OF THE

02:23:17.288 --> 02:23:19.023
INSTITUTIONS THAT'S TRYING TO

02:23:19.090 --> 02:23:20.959
LEAD THE WAY FOR. EDUCATION

02:23:21.025 --> 02:23:22.460
HEALTHCARE AND MEDICAL

02:23:22.527 --> 02:23:24.762
RESEARCH. WE ACTUALLY HAVE

02:23:24.829 --> 02:23:26.664
ABOUT THE MOST EXPERIENCE WITH

02:23:26.731 --> 02:23:28.900
ANTIBODY TESTING IN THE STATE

02:23:28.967 --> 02:23:31.069
SO WE HAVE- DONE THOUSANDS OF

02:23:31.135 --> 02:23:33.037
RESULTS. AND THAT WE HAVE ADDED

02:23:33.104 --> 02:23:34.706
THEM WITH THE VARIOUS CLINICAL

02:23:34.772 --> 02:23:37.608
HISTORIES OF ALL ON OUR CALL

02:23:37.675 --> 02:23:39.310
THE PATIENTS THAT HAVE. COME

02:23:39.377 --> 02:23:41.079
THROUGH SAN FRANCISCO GENERAL

02:23:41.145 --> 02:23:43.581
FROM DAY ONE AND I'M HERE TO

02:23:43.648 --> 02:23:45.683
SORT ASSURE YOU JUST BRIEFLY

02:23:45.750 --> 02:23:48.920
ARE EXPERIENCED AN ECHO SOME OF

02:23:48.987 --> 02:23:51.990
DR DEAN OF COMMENTS THAT. RIGHT

02:23:52.056 --> 02:23:54.625
NOW WE'RE NOT REALLY READY TO

02:23:54.692 --> 02:23:56.828
DISTRIBUTE ANTIBODY TESTING. TO

02:23:56.894 --> 02:23:58.096
EVERYBODY BECAUSE WE'RE NOT

02:23:58.162 --> 02:24:00.064
SURE WHAT IT MEANS I CERTAINLY

02:24:00.131 --> 02:24:03.101
AGREE THAT EVERYBODY POSITIVITY

02:24:03.167 --> 02:24:05.937
INDICATES A PRIOR INFECTION WE

02:24:06.004 --> 02:24:07.805
REALLY DON'T HAVE ANY ISSUES.

02:24:07.872 --> 02:24:09.741
WITH CROSS REACTIVITY TO OTHER

02:24:09.807 --> 02:24:12.744
ARE VIRUSES. BUT THE PROBLEM IS

02:24:12.810 --> 02:24:15.947
YOU HAVE- NO GUARANTEE. OF

02:24:16.014 --> 02:24:17.949
IMMUNITY AND SO AS A

02:24:18.016 --> 02:24:20.084
POPULATION. HOW YOU CAN USE

02:24:20.151 --> 02:24:22.387
THAT INFORMATION ARE YOU

02:24:22.453 --> 02:24:23.321
BECAUSE YOU THINK THAT YOUR

02:24:23.388 --> 02:24:25.623
POSITIVE OF HAVING AN INFECTION

02:24:25.690 --> 02:24:27.525
THAT YOU CAN LACKS. ON YOUR

02:24:27.592 --> 02:24:29.761
SOCIAL DISTANCE SAYING THAT YOU

02:24:29.827 --> 02:24:31.162
CAN RETURN TO WORK WITH FULL

02:24:31.229 --> 02:24:32.830
CONFIDENCE THAT YOU WILL NOT BE

02:24:32.897 --> 02:24:34.766
SPREADING THE VIRUS TO ANYBODY

02:24:34.832 --> 02:24:36.901
ELSE. THESE ARE THE IMPORTANT

02:24:36.968 --> 02:24:39.570
QUESTIONS THAT WE NEED TO ASK

02:24:39.637 --> 02:24:42.840
RIGHT NOW BEFORE GOING TO RELAX

02:24:42.907 --> 02:24:44.475
THE SHELTER IN PLACE OR WE'RE

02:24:44.542 --> 02:24:46.677
GOING TO RETURN. EVERYBODY BACK

02:24:46.744 --> 02:24:49.347
TO. TO WORK AND YOU KNOW WE DO

02:24:49.414 --> 02:24:51.649
NEED TO GET BACK TO WORK

02:24:51.716 --> 02:24:53.284
ECONOMY IS IN RECESSION. HI

02:24:53.351 --> 02:24:55.887
THIS IS A VERY DIFFICULT TIME

02:24:55.953 --> 02:24:57.455
FOR MOST OF THE PEOPLE IN OUR

02:24:57.522 --> 02:24:59.757
STATE UNEMPLOYMENT VERY HIGH.

02:24:59.824 --> 02:25:00.992
WHAT WE NEED TO BE VERY

02:25:01.059 --> 02:25:02.293
CAUTIOUS AND SO WHAT I WANTED

02:25:02.360 --> 02:25:06.731
TO. SHOW YOU ARE COUPLE OF

02:25:06.798 --> 02:25:08.766
SLIDES THAT TELLS HISTORY OF

02:25:08.833 --> 02:25:10.168
WE'VE DONE. SO TO GIVE YOU A

02:25:10.234 --> 02:25:11.169
IDEA WHAT SOME OF THESE RESULTS

02:25:11.235 --> 02:25:23.448
MEAN. SO HERE. THREE DIFFERENT

02:25:23.514 --> 02:25:26.551
TIME PERIODS I'M SORRY TO. TWO

02:25:26.617 --> 02:25:29.921
DIFFERENT TESTS FOR- KOBE THEIR

02:25:29.987 --> 02:25:31.689
BODIES THE MOST TYPICAL

02:25:31.756 --> 02:25:33.424
PRESENTATION IS THAT YOU GET

02:25:33.491 --> 02:25:35.726
ANTIBODIES WITHIN THE FIRST

02:25:35.793 --> 02:25:37.195
SEVEN TO TEN DAYS. I GM COMES

02:25:37.261 --> 02:25:40.631
FIRST AID IDG COMES LATER BOB I

02:25:40.698 --> 02:25:41.799
WOULD SAY THREE QUARTERS OF OUR

02:25:41.866 --> 02:25:43.434
PATIENTS LOOK LIKE THIS. BUT

02:25:43.501 --> 02:25:44.268
THEN THERE'S A HANDFUL OF

02:25:44.335 --> 02:25:46.337
PEOPLE WHO HAVE DELAYED

02:25:46.404 --> 02:25:48.906
RESPONSE YOU CAN SEE HERE THAT.

02:25:48.973 --> 02:25:50.741
THIS PERSON DIDN'T DEVELOP

02:25:50.808 --> 02:25:52.743
ANTIBODIES FOR THREE WEEKS

02:25:52.810 --> 02:25:54.579
EVERYBODY SAYS WELL CORENTIN

02:25:54.645 --> 02:25:56.013
FOR TWO WEEKS AND YOU'RE FINE.

02:25:56.080 --> 02:25:57.482
NOT SO SURE ABOUT THAT IN THIS

02:25:57.548 --> 02:25:59.183
PARTICULAR CASE. HERE'S AN

02:25:59.250 --> 02:26:01.986
INDIVIDUAL WHO HAD A DECLINE IN

02:26:02.053 --> 02:26:04.322
THE ANTIBODY RESPONSE AFTER TWO

02:26:04.388 --> 02:26:06.557
AND A HALF WEEKS OUT. IS THIS

02:26:06.624 --> 02:26:08.693
PERSON A MOON DURING THE FIRST

02:26:08.759 --> 02:26:10.328
TWO WEEKS AND IS NOW BECOMING A

02:26:10.394 --> 02:26:12.964
NON IMMUNE WE DON'T KNOW THAT.

02:26:13.030 --> 02:26:14.899
AND THEN THE MOST INSIDIOUS OF

02:26:14.966 --> 02:26:17.368
ALL THE DATA IS 4% OF PATIENTS

02:26:17.435 --> 02:26:19.504
HAVE NO ANTIBODIES AFTER THIRTY

02:26:19.570 --> 02:26:20.938
DAYS SOME OF THEM ARE IMMUNE

02:26:21.005 --> 02:26:23.007
SUPPRESSED SOME OF THEM ARE NOT

02:26:23.074 --> 02:26:26.043
CAPABLE OF RAISING ANTIBODIES.

02:26:26.110 --> 02:26:27.111
SO THESE ARE DATA FROM A

02:26:27.178 --> 02:26:29.113
QUANTITATIVE CENTRAL LAB

02:26:29.180 --> 02:26:30.948
PLATFORM. THAT ALLOWS US TO

02:26:31.015 --> 02:26:33.451
LOOK AT THE FIDELITY OF THIS

02:26:33.518 --> 02:26:35.786
TEST. IF WE'RE GOING TO GO WITH

02:26:35.853 --> 02:26:39.223
RAPID POINTED CARE DEVICES SUCH

02:26:39.290 --> 02:26:41.792
AS SEEN HERE ON THE RIGHT. I

02:26:41.859 --> 02:26:45.396
THINK THAT THAT'S A MISTAKE. WE

02:26:45.463 --> 02:26:47.165
OWE THAT RELY. THESE LAST AT

02:26:47.231 --> 02:26:48.799
LEAST AS CURRENTLY CAN. IS NOT

02:26:48.866 --> 02:26:53.571
THE NOW FIVE. IF TO THE THIRD

02:26:53.638 --> 02:26:57.441
FLOOR. WHERE THEY COULD BE.

02:26:57.508 --> 02:26:58.943
MADE NOT ONLINE. HOW DO YOU

02:26:59.010 --> 02:27:00.778
PASSED IN IF YOU SAY WELL GET

02:27:00.845 --> 02:27:02.880
YOUR POP. YOUR GO OUT IN THE-

02:27:02.947 --> 02:27:05.550
HAVE. A GOOD TIME. IN YOUR

02:27:05.616 --> 02:27:08.119
PICTURES. AND START THE EFFECTS

02:27:08.186 --> 02:27:10.855
ALL OF AND I THINK THAT IS.

02:27:10.922 --> 02:27:17.128
WHAT THE MOST DANGER. SO I

02:27:17.195 --> 02:27:18.896
WOULD NEED TO SHOW YOU THE

02:27:18.963 --> 02:27:20.097
BECAUSE I WANT YOU TO HAVE AN

02:27:20.164 --> 02:27:21.232
IMAGE OF WHAT'S GOING ON. SO

02:27:21.299 --> 02:27:23.134
THE SOCK BALL THE VIRUS AND THE-

02:27:23.201 --> 02:27:24.001
OF THE BOTTOM STRUCTURE IS A

02:27:24.068 --> 02:27:26.204
OUR LONG CELLS. OF THE VIRUS IS

02:27:26.270 --> 02:27:28.439
TO RECESS. IT'S HERE. AND THEN

02:27:28.506 --> 02:27:31.509
TAKES OVER G. OF PROTEIN MAKING

02:27:31.576 --> 02:27:33.511
CAPABILITIES OF OUR CELL SO

02:27:33.578 --> 02:27:35.246
INSTEAD OF PRODUCING CELLS ARE

02:27:35.313 --> 02:27:37.081
PROTEINS THAT WE NEED. IT

02:27:37.148 --> 02:27:40.184
STARTS PRODUCING VIRUS AND A

02:27:40.251 --> 02:27:42.987
DEN PROPAGATES ANYTHING THIS

02:27:43.054 --> 02:27:44.622
ISSUE GOES ON AND ON.

02:27:44.689 --> 02:27:48.726
ANTIBODIES ARE KEY TO- BLOCKING

02:27:48.793 --> 02:27:52.230
THE ENTRY OF THE VIRUS TO THE

02:27:52.296 --> 02:27:54.165
CELLS THESE ARE WHAT WE CALL

02:27:54.232 --> 02:27:56.467
NEUTRALIZING ANTIBODIES THESE

02:27:56.534 --> 02:27:57.635
ARE THE ONES THAT WE ARE ALSO

02:27:57.702 --> 02:28:02.607
HOPING TO GET. WHEN WE GET A

02:28:02.673 --> 02:28:03.274
VACCINE. THERE IS ALSO

02:28:03.341 --> 02:28:05.843
DISCUSSED OF. GIVING MONOCLONAL

02:28:05.910 --> 02:28:07.612
ANTIBODIES THAT WILL BLOCK THIS

02:28:07.678 --> 02:28:11.249
PROCESS SO ANTIBODY PRODUCTION

02:28:11.315 --> 02:28:13.651
IS KEY BUT THE QUESTION IS WHAT

02:28:13.718 --> 02:28:15.920
IS OUR ANTIBODIES BEING

02:28:15.987 --> 02:28:18.055
DIRECTED TO THAT THERE ARE MORE

02:28:18.122 --> 02:28:20.524
THAN JUST A SO CALLED SPIKE

02:28:20.591 --> 02:28:23.461
PROTEIN. IN THE VIRUS THERE ARE

02:28:23.527 --> 02:28:25.563
OTHER PROTEINS THAT ARE PART OF

02:28:25.630 --> 02:28:27.898
THE STRUCTURE OF THE VIRUS

02:28:27.965 --> 02:28:30.601
ITSELF. THAT DON'T REALLY

02:28:30.668 --> 02:28:33.337
INDICATE THAT THERE IS A MUNITY

02:28:33.404 --> 02:28:35.139
DOESN'T BLOCK THIS ENTRY

02:28:35.206 --> 02:28:37.608
PROCESS THEN IT'S NOT IMMUNE

02:28:37.675 --> 02:28:39.910
IT'S ALL BYSTANDER IT TELLS YOU

02:28:39.977 --> 02:28:41.145
THAT THE VIRUS PROTEIN WAS

02:28:41.212 --> 02:28:43.314
THERE. FOR TICKETS A STRUCTURAL

02:28:43.381 --> 02:28:45.349
PROTEIN QUITE FRANKLY IT

02:28:45.416 --> 02:28:46.984
DOESN'T HELP US IS WE DON'T

02:28:47.051 --> 02:28:49.320
KNOW IF THIS IS A MUNITY SO

02:28:49.387 --> 02:28:50.921
THERE IS A GOLD STANDARD TEST.

02:28:50.988 --> 02:28:51.989
THE GOLD STANDARD TEST IS

02:28:52.056 --> 02:28:53.591
CALLED A PLAQUE NEUTRALIZATION

02:28:53.658 --> 02:28:56.961
ASPECT. WHERE WORKS IS THAT YOU

02:28:57.028 --> 02:29:00.398
TAKE CELLS ARE PETRI DISH THAT

02:29:00.464 --> 02:29:03.100
YOU CAN RAISE YOU TREATED WITH

02:29:03.167 --> 02:29:05.569
ANTIBODIES FROM A PATIENT SO

02:29:05.636 --> 02:29:07.438
THEY HAVE NEUTRALIZING

02:29:07.505 --> 02:29:11.642
ANTIBODIES AS SHOWN IN THE RED

02:29:11.709 --> 02:29:15.579
DIAMOND HERE. THEY WILL BLOCK.

02:29:15.646 --> 02:29:19.917
HE ALSO I FIRE TO IN. THAT SO.

02:29:19.984 --> 02:29:21.085
THAT IS THE BUT WE WANT TO SEE.

02:29:21.152 --> 02:29:23.154
IF WE ERA BY. THAT ARE WHAT I

02:29:23.220 --> 02:29:25.723
SAY BYSTANDERS THAT DO NOT IN

02:29:25.790 --> 02:29:28.225
NEUTRALIZE THE ABILITY OF THE

02:29:28.292 --> 02:29:30.094
VIRUS TO GAIN ENTRY TO

02:29:30.161 --> 02:29:34.532
OURSELVES THEN THIS IS A- NON

02:29:34.598 --> 02:29:37.768
NEUTRALIZING ANTIBODY. IT'S A

02:29:37.835 --> 02:29:40.137
MY LAST SLIDE IS THIS ONE THIS

02:29:40.204 --> 02:29:42.940
IS A STUDY CONDUCTED IN CHINA

02:29:43.007 --> 02:29:45.009
ARE USING ONE OF THE SPIKE

02:29:45.076 --> 02:29:48.112
PROTEINS AS THE BINDING FOR THE

02:29:48.179 --> 02:29:50.915
ANTIBODIES SO THE X. AXIS HERE

02:29:50.981 --> 02:29:53.784
ON THE BOTTOM IS THE RESULT OF

02:29:53.851 --> 02:29:56.654
A- TYPICAL WHAT WE CALL ALISA

02:29:56.721 --> 02:29:59.523
ANTIBODY TEST. THE Y. AXIS THE

02:29:59.590 --> 02:30:02.326
UP AND DOWN ACCESS IS THE

02:30:02.393 --> 02:30:04.395
RESULT OF THE- ACTUALIZING

02:30:04.462 --> 02:30:06.731
ANTIBODY TEST THAT WHICH THAT I

02:30:06.797 --> 02:30:07.264
SHOWED YOU IN THE PREVIOUS

02:30:07.331 --> 02:30:09.667
SLIDE. AND THE THREE ZONES THAT

02:30:09.734 --> 02:30:11.669
I'VE HIGHLIGHTED IN RED ARE KEY

02:30:11.736 --> 02:30:14.238
HERE. HIS OWN IN THE BOTTOM

02:30:14.305 --> 02:30:16.841
LEFT INDICATES THAT THERE ARE

02:30:16.907 --> 02:30:19.009
SOME PATIENTS WHO HAVE NO

02:30:19.076 --> 02:30:21.779
ANTIBODY RESPONSE AND WHO DON'T

02:30:21.846 --> 02:30:22.213
PRODUCE NEUTRALIZING

02:30:22.279 --> 02:30:25.449
ANTIBODIES. NOT IMMUNE WE DON'T

02:30:25.516 --> 02:30:27.284
EVEN KNOW IF THEY'RE INFECTED

02:30:27.351 --> 02:30:28.986
OR PERCENT OF OUR PATIENTS ARE

02:30:29.053 --> 02:30:31.789
SO EXHIBIT THIS. THAT'S NOT SO

02:30:31.856 --> 02:30:32.923
MUCH OF A PROBLEM. LOOK AT THE

02:30:32.990 --> 02:30:35.226
LOOK AT THE TOP LEFT THE TOP

02:30:35.292 --> 02:30:36.961
LEFT HERE TO PATIENTS OR MAYBE

02:30:37.027 --> 02:30:40.965
MORE THEY HAVE NO ANTIBODIES

02:30:41.031 --> 02:30:43.300
BUT THEY HAVE OTHER ANTIBODIES

02:30:43.367 --> 02:30:46.337
ARE NOT BE DETECTED BY THE

02:30:46.404 --> 02:30:48.672
CURRENTLY AVAILABLE A LICENSE.

02:30:48.739 --> 02:30:51.008
AND THESE ARE IN FACT. IMMUNE

02:30:51.075 --> 02:30:52.543
SO YOU HAVE SOMEBODY WHO COULD

02:30:52.610 --> 02:30:54.044
BE IMMUNE EVEN THOUGH THEY

02:30:54.111 --> 02:30:56.013
DON'T HAVE ANTIBODIES YOU JUST

02:30:56.080 --> 02:30:57.248
HAVE TO PRODUCE THE RIGHT

02:30:57.314 --> 02:31:00.317
ADVICE OKAY SO THAT TOO. IS NOT

02:31:00.384 --> 02:31:01.585
SO MUCH OF THE PROBLEM THAT I

02:31:01.652 --> 02:31:05.589
SEE. THE PROBLEM I SEE IS THE

02:31:05.656 --> 02:31:06.590
BOTTOM RIGHT SET ON IN THE- AND

02:31:06.657 --> 02:31:07.625
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE CAUGHT

02:31:07.691 --> 02:31:09.627
CONCENTRATION WOULD BE FOR THE

02:31:09.693 --> 02:31:11.429
NEUTRALIZING ANTIBODY IN THIS

02:31:11.495 --> 02:31:12.930
CHART THEY COULD INVADE EVEN A

02:31:12.997 --> 02:31:14.732
LITTLE BIT HIGHER THAN THAT

02:31:14.799 --> 02:31:16.233
CIRCLE. WHAT THESE PATIENTS

02:31:16.300 --> 02:31:18.469
SYNDICATE AND DOCTORS I CAN ASK

02:31:18.536 --> 02:31:20.137

PATIENTS HAVE ANTIBODIES. THAT

02:31:30.381 --> 02:31:32.616
ARE NOT NEUTRALIZING SO IF YOU

02:31:32.683 --> 02:31:34.752
TELL THEM THAT THEY'RE IMMUNE

02:31:34.819 --> 02:31:36.387
IS SEND THEM BACK INTO THE

CONFERENCE AND THE REASON I'M

02:48:08.311 --> 02:48:11.314
HONING IN ON THIS IS. THERE WAS

02:48:11.381 --> 02:48:11.915
THERE WERE STATEMENTS MADE AT

02:48:11.981 --> 02:48:15.185
THAT. AN INDIVIDUAL. WHO AT THE

02:48:15.251 --> 02:48:19.255
TIME HE PERISHED. ARM SUFFERED

02:48:19.322 --> 02:48:20.590
FROM AILMENT COMPLETELY

02:48:20.657 --> 02:48:23.159
UNRELATED US EXAMPLE OF A HEART

02:48:23.226 --> 02:48:25.628
ATTACK. PAN BECAUSE AT THE TIME

02:48:25.695 --> 02:48:28.398
OF DEATH. HE HAD TESTED

02:48:28.465 --> 02:48:32.635
POSITIVE. THEY RULED THAT A CO

02:48:32.702 --> 02:48:35.104
GOOD YEAH. SO I GUESS WHAT I'M

02:48:35.171 --> 02:48:38.341
TRYING TO UNDERSTAND IS OUR- IS

02:48:38.408 --> 02:48:41.778
EVERYONE WHO HAS CO GOOD. AUG

02:48:41.845 --> 02:48:44.914
OF TEST POSITIVE FOR COBRA ARE

02:48:44.981 --> 02:48:46.816
WHETHER NOT THEY PASSED AWAY

02:48:46.883 --> 02:48:49.052
FOR SOME COMPLETELY UNRELATED

02:48:49.118 --> 02:48:51.688
COSTS ARE THEY PUT ON THE

02:48:51.754 --> 02:48:55.792
ROSTER OF CODED RELATED DEATHS.

02:48:55.859 --> 02:48:59.062
THERE WILL. YEAH SO I BELIEVE

02:48:59.128 --> 02:49:01.164
THE ANSWER IS YES I CERTAINLY

02:49:01.231 --> 02:49:02.899
THERE COULD BE A COINCIDENCE

02:49:02.966 --> 02:49:03.933
THAT SOMEBODY HAS A HEART

02:49:04.000 --> 02:49:06.035
ATTACK AND ALSO IS CALLED A

02:49:06.102 --> 02:49:08.571
POSITIVE BUT YOU CAN ALSO ASK

02:49:08.638 --> 02:49:10.373
DID THE COLD THE DISEASE CAUSED

02:49:10.440 --> 02:49:12.942
THE HEART ATTACK WE KNOW THAT

02:49:13.009 --> 02:49:15.545
KOBE IS A HIGHLY CARDIO TOXIC

02:49:15.612 --> 02:49:18.781
SO IT'LL EIGHT IT IF A PERSON

02:49:18.848 --> 02:49:21.351
WHO HAD CALLED THEN SURVIVES

02:49:21.417 --> 02:49:23.019
AND THEN HAD A HEART ATTACK

02:49:23.086 --> 02:49:24.220
YEAH THEN I COULD SEE THAT

02:49:24.287 --> 02:49:25.722
THERE COULD BE SOME AMBIGUITY

02:49:25.788 --> 02:49:27.357
BUT CERTAINLY COLD BIT

02:49:27.423 --> 02:49:29.759
INFECTIVITY PLAYED A ROLE MORE

02:49:29.826 --> 02:49:31.427
THAN LIKELY UNLESS THEY'RE

02:49:31.494 --> 02:49:32.896
COMPLETELY ASYMPTOMATIC IN

02:49:32.962 --> 02:49:33.830
WHICH CASE. WE MIGHT NOT EVEN

02:49:33.897 --> 02:49:37.300
HAVE KNOWN THAT THEY WERE COLD

02:49:37.367 --> 02:49:38.701
ACOSTA. ARE YOU WILL YES OTHER

02:49:38.768 --> 02:49:40.303
STATES AND OTHER COUNTRIES ARE

02:49:40.370 --> 02:49:41.538
MAKING THE SAME METRIC

02:49:41.604 --> 02:49:43.606
DETERMINATIONS THAT WE ARE IN

02:49:43.673 --> 02:49:49.245
THAT PARTICULAR INSTANCE. AND I

02:49:49.312 --> 02:49:50.780

LIKE A COMPANY LIKE QUEST YOU

02:55:51.974 --> 02:55:53.442
THAT KIND OF THING. BUT IT IS A

02:55:53.509 --> 02:55:54.777
