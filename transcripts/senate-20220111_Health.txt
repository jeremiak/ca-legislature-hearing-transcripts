FIRST WE WANT TO STATE THAT WE ARE THE YEAH WE ABSOLUTELY UNDERSTAND AND SYMPATHIZE WITH PATIENTS WERE BURDENED WITH HIGH CONFIDENCE ONE. AND WE SHARE ARE YOU WILLING TO REPLACE RATIONS THAT THE EXPONENTIAL RISE PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICES CONTINUE TO DRIVE INCREASING COSTS WITHIN OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. WE CONTINUALLY AND SEPARATELY EXPRESSED THAT ADDRESSING THE PORTABILITY PRESCRIPTION DRUGS IN OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. IS CRITICAL TO MAINTAINING. AFFORDABILITY PARMALEE. BASICALLY FOR AN- IF YOU PER HAVE COST INCREASE IN TWENTY FOURTEEN WITH NO END IN SIGHT. HE IS ALSO IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THESE PRICES CONTINUE TO INCREASE WITHOUT ANY MAJOR MEDICAL IMPROVEMENT THE DROUGHT SEVENTY THREE DOES NOT NEED A TEMPERATURE AT THAT PRICE INCREASES IMPLEMENTED BY THE MANUFACTURERS AND I THOUGHT. WELL YOU KNOW CALIFORNIA CURRENTLY LIMIT PATIENT COST SHARING FOR ALL PRESCRIPTION DRUGS THE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS. FOR THIRTY DAY SUPPLY. THE CAP WAS CAREFULLY AND BUCKLING DOES SHE EXPECT PROTECT. ALL CONSUMERS FROM HYPOTHETICALLY DRUGS WHILE ENSURING THAT. THE OVERALL COST OF HEALTHCARE IN PORTABLE. AND AT FORTY THREE IN ITS CURRENT FORM DIRECTLY INTERFERES WITH APPLE I. STATUS IN ARBITRARY PRICE HAPPENING PLAN WITHOUT ADDRESSING THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE TYPE RIGHT. WHICH IS THE EVER INCREASING PRICE THE DRUG MANUFACTURER TARGET THE FLIGHT THEY NEED DR. WE DO WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE AMENDMENT THAT ARE COMING OUT OF ME TODAY AND WILL BE WORKING WITH OUR MEMBERS.

I WOULD PREDICT THE PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED CALIFORNIA WOMEN'S PATIENT COST SHARING FOR ALL PRESCRIPTION DIRECTED TWO HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS FOR A THIRTY DAY SUPPLY. THE CATHOLIC CHURCH I AM NOT GOING TO GO SHE DID IN ORDER TO PROTECT CONSUMERS FROM THE HIGH COST OF SPECIALTY DRUGS WHILE INSURING THAT THE COST OF HEALTHCARE RIPPING INTO CORTICAL. BILL DIRECTLY INTERFERES A TACKLE AND INCREASING THE COST OF PREMIUMS FOR ALL INSURANCE ENROLLEES BY TREATING INSULIN DRUGS DIFFERENTLY. WHAT DO YOU THINK THAT COST SHARING OF INSULIN DRUG USE SOCIAL LIFE THAT ADDITIONAL EXPENSE AGAINST ALL RATEPAYERS. ULTIMATELY CREATING WINNERS AND LOSERS WITHIN OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM BY TREATING INDIVIDUAL WRONG IS CURRENTLY BASED ON SPECIFIC DISEASE. AND OR DRUGS THAT THEY TAKE OUR CONCERN WITH RESPECT TO THE PORTABILITY- I DIGITAL IS FURTHER. DEVELOP DEMENTIA BERGMAN ALASTAIR AS IT WAS A MAN IT. WOULD COST ME FIFTY NINE MILLION DOLLARS IN ADDITION ALL. CHANGING THE PRESSURE DRUG BENEFITS IN THIS MAN MAKES IT DIFFICULT FOR INSURE TO MEET THEIR STOCK EVER. ACT VALUE. WITHIN A ESPECIALLY MY BROWN LEVEL. IF MANDATED REDUCTION IN COST SHARING IMPACT ACTUAL VALUE FOR PLANTING INSURERS MAYBE FOURTH INCREASE OTHER COST SHARING COMPONENTS IN ORDER TO KEEP THE OVERALL BENEFIT DESIGN WITHIN THE REQUIRED ACTION WROTE ABOUT YOU. ADDRESSING AFFORDABILITY OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS IN THE ABILITY OF THOSE WHO NEED THEM TO ABSORB THE RISING COST OF THE CRITICAL CONTINUING ISSUE. ULTIMATELY IT IS THE UNDERLYING RISING COST OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS THAT DRIVES THE NEED FOR COST SHARING AND FACTORED GREATLY INTO INCREASING THE COST OF HEALTHCARE. CURRENTLY PRESCRIPTION DRUGS ARE THE SECOND HIGH EXPENSE INCLUDES OUR HEALTH PLANS AND INSURERS. FOR THESE REASONS WE ARE CURRENTLY OPPOSED TO THE BILL- IMPRINT WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE DOCTOR BUT REGRETTABLY OUR PLEDGE TO TRY. THANK YOU.
