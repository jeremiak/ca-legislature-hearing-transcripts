SPORTS TOURISM AND INTERNET MEDIA. THIS CALL TO ORDER AND WE DON'T HAVE A CORE AND YET. WELL WE HAVE THE SENATORS SKINNER READY TO PRESENT -- SB TWO ZERO SIX SO SENATOR OKAY THANKS SO MUCH -- THANK YOU. CHAIR AND MEMBERS -- WE ARE PRESENTING. I AM JOINED BY MY PRINCIPAL. JOINT CO AUTHOR -- CENTER BRADFORD AND WE ARE PRESENTING SB TWO OH SIX SB TWO OH SIX ADDRESSES A LONG STANDING. ISSUE IN COLLEGE ATHLETICS AND THAT IS THAT OUR STUDENT ATHLETES ARE TREATED FAR DIFFERENTLY THAN ANY OTHER CATEGORY OF STUDENTS THEY ARE THE ONLY CATEGORY OF STUDENTS. THAT ARE COMPLETELY PROHIBITED FROM MONETIZING THEIR SKILL OR TALENT IN ANY WAY IF YOU CONSIDER ANY OTHER COLLEGE MAJOR THERE IS NO RESTRICTION ON THAT COLLEGE MAJOR WHETHER THAT COLLEGE STUDENT IS AN ENGINEERING STUDENT A COMPUTER SCIENCE STUDENT MUSIC. MAJORING IN MUSIC MAJORING IN DRAMA THERE IS NO PROHIBITION ON THERE USING THEIR SKILLS. TO TO PERFORM TO RECORD TO PRODUCE AN APP TO DO COMPUTER GRAPHICS. ONLY COLLEGE ATHLETES SO WHAT IS SB TWO OH SIX DO. IT PROVIDES OUR COLLEGE ATHLETES THE SAME RIGHTS AS OLYMPIC ATHLETES TO RECEIVE A FINANCIAL GAIN FROM THEIR NAME IMAGE AND LIKENESS THROUGH SPONSORSHIPS AND ENDORSEMENTS. YESTERDAY ON THE FLOOR OF BOTH OF OUR HOUSES FOR PRIDE MONTH WE ARE HONORED A NUMBER OF PEOPLE AMONG THEM WAS FORMER NBA PLAYER JASON COLLINS [inaudible] NOW. AFTER THE CEREMONY I WAS SPEAKING WITH JASON COLLINS AND HE HAD SEEN THE USA TODAY ARTICLE SO WE TALKED ABOUT SB. TWO OH SIX WHAT DID HE TELL ME HE SAID THAT AS A STUDENT AT STANFORD. HE SAW HIMSELF DEPICTED IN A VIDEO GAME ABOUT BASKETBALL. THIS WAS A GAME THAT HE HAD PURCHASED. YET IT WAS USING HIS LIKENESS WITHOUT PERMISSION OR WITHOUT PROVIDING ANY PAYMENT. THESE ARE THE TYPES OF CIRCUMSTANCES THAT COLLEGE ATHLETES CONTINUALLY FACE. NOW FOR FEMALE ATHLETES THE PROBLEM IS EVEN MORE SERIOUS BECAUSE AND I IMAGINE MANY OF YOU ARE THINKING YOU KNOW THE MALE ATHLETES THEY HAVE THE POSSIBILITY TO GO PRO. OF COURSE YOU'LL HEAR LATER WHAT TINY TINY PERCENT OF ATHLETES EVERY EVEN HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY GO PRO BUT IF YOU THINK ABOUT WOMEN ATHLETES. THERE ARE FEW TO NO PROFESSIONAL OPPORTUNITIES. COLLEGE MAY BE THE ONLY TIME FOR WHICH THEIR ATHLETIC PROWESS MAYBE SO VALUED THAT THEY MIGHT BE ABLE TO HAVE THEIR HOME TOWN CAR DEALER FOR THAT MATTER SPONSORED THEM OR ROTARY CLUB OR QANTAS CLUB. ALL OF WHICH IS PROHIBITED NOW UNDER THE AND SEE TO A ROLES. AND THOSE RULES CREATE AS I MENTIONED VERY UNFAIR CONDITIONS CONDITIONS THAT THE FORMER CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER OF THE NC TO A DâN BOGAN WHO WAS ALSO A FORMER VICE CHANCELLOR AT UC BERKELEY. HE SAYS THEY ARE CONTRADICTORY TO A KEY TENET OF THE NC TWO EIGHT OWN BYLAWS. AND IN WITHIN THE NC TWO WAYS BY LAWS IS THE FOLLOWING PHRASE. THAT THEIR RULES ASSURE THAT ATHLETICS PARTICIPANTS ARE NOT TREATED DIFFERENTLY FROM ANY OTHER MEMBER OF THE STUDENT BODY. AND YET AS I DESCRIBED THE STUDENTS ARE TREATED DIFFERENTLY THAN ANY OTHER [inaudible] STUDENT MEMBER -- I'M GONNA TURN NOW TO MY JOINT AUTHOR SO HE CAN MAKE SOME COMMENTS THANK YOU CENTERS SKINNER AND MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I IT WON'T BE REDUNDANT BUT I THINK ARE. SINNERS SKINNER MADE IT CLEAR THIS IS THE ISSUE THAT'S NOT REALLY CENTERED ON SPORTS CENTER ON FAIRNESS AND IN MANY WAYS IT'S A CIVIL RIGHTS ISSUE -- AGAIN THE MAJORITY OF THESE ATHLETES -- ARE AFRICAN AMERICAN OVER HALF OF ON YOUR FOOTBALL AND BASKETBALL TEAMS ARE AFRICAN AMERICAN YOUNG MAN DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE ONLY MAKE UP 3%. OF THE STUDENT BODY ON MOST CAMPUSES IN UNIVERSITIES THE YOUNG MAN AS WELL AS WOMEN -- FILL ARENAS ALL ACROSS THIS COUNTRY WERE. A UNIVERSITIES MAKE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS BECAUSE OF THEIR ATHLETIC TALENT. AND THE REAL CONTRARY HERE IS THAT YOU HAVE CULTURES THAT COME INTO THESE YOUNG FOLKS HOMES COACHES WARM NOW MILLIONAIRES COACHES WHO CAN NOW SIR ASSAD SIGNED ENDORSEMENT DEALS AS WELL. FOR THE JERSEY FOR THE SHOES THAT THESE ATHLETES APPLY A PLAY AT AND AGAIN THESE ATHLETES ARE NOT ABLE TO BENEFIT NOT ONE DIME. I WANT TO SEND YOU A STATE OR AYE A ODD TO THE COLLEGE WITH A BUNCH OF ATHLETE TO ONE ON THE APPLY PROS SPORTS. BUT MANY OF THEM BORROWED MONEY. FROM ME WHILE IN COLLEGE BECAUSE DESPITE BEING ON A SCHOLARSHIP THEY COULD MAKE ENDS MEET. AT AGAIN A SCHOLARSHIP FOR THE MOST PART ONLY PAY FOR TUITION AND ROOM AND BOARD ON A VERY MINIMAL A SITUATION YET WE ALL KNOW YOU NEED FAR MORE. THAN THAT TO SURVIVE MANY OF THESE ATHLETES DID NOT EVEN HAVE CARS. NOT TO GET TO AND FROM. A CAMPUS ONCE A FOR THOSE WHO LIVE OFF CAMPUS SO. THIS IS THE ISSUE OF FAIRNESS -- IT'S NOT ABOUT -- REALLY. ALL. GETTING RICH AS A COLLEGE ATHLETE AT SOME FOLKS WANNA MAKE THIS OUT BUT THE REAL PHENOMENON HERE IS THAT. MOST. ATHLETE TO PLAY BASKETBALL ARE RECRUITED UNDER THE PREMISE THAT. IT'LL BE ONE AND DONE. THEY SIGNED FOR ONE YEAR. JUST AS WE JUST SAW LAST WEEK ZION WILLIAMSON. THE NUMBER ONE PICK IN THE NATION. AND THEY ENTERED SCHOOL LIKE THAT. OUR YOUNG MAN WHO GREW UP IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD WHO WENT ON TO PLAY. FOR A UNIVERSITY OF PORTLAND PLATE FOR THE KINGS FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS HIS FATHER WAS VERY CLEAR HE'S DOING ONE AND DOT. HE'S GOING TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF HIS ATHLETIC ABILITIES JUST GET ENOUGH EXPERIENCE ON THAT -- INTO A COLLEGE LEVEL DIVISION ONE LEVEL AND HE'S GONNA GO PEARL AND THAT'S WHAT HE'S DONE AND THAT'S WHAT INCENTIVIZE IS MOST OF THESE YOUNG. ATHLETES NOT EVEN TO A MANAGER AT EDUCATION SO I WHICH AS I STATED -- ON OUR FLOOR THAT THIS BILL DID MORE I WISH IT GUARANTEED CONTINUING EDUCATION FOR ANY ATHLETE WHO PLAYED FOR A MAJOR UNIVERSITY UNTIL THEY ACHIEVE A DEGREE IN IF THEY WANT TO GO ON TO GET A GRADUATE DEGREE. THEY SHOULD BE AFFORDED THAT OPPORTUNITY BECAUSE AGAIN. THE GENERATE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND DON'T BENEFITS SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A VOTE. THANK YOU. THE WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. GOOD MORNING CHAIR AND ASSEMBLYMEMBERS -- THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO COME SPEAK ABOUT SB TWO OH SIX AS A FORMER STUDENT ATHLETE MYSELF -- AND A RETIRED ATHLETE I GUESS YOU COULD SAY -- MY NAME IS ERIN CAFARO AND I AM A TWO TIME OLYMPIC GOLD MEDALIST AND A UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA. GOLDEN BERYL -- SO -- GO BEARS -- I'M HERE. TO SUPPORT SB TWO OH SIX FOR THE WELL BEING OF THE CURRENT STERN ATHLETES AND ALSO BRING TO LIGHT THE IMPLICATIONS OF THE BILL. FOR THE FUTURE SUCCESS OF STUDENT ATHLETES AND THEIR FUTURE ENDEAVORS AFTER GRADUATION [inaudible] SO. I WALKED ONTO THE COW WOMEN'S ROWING TEAM -- AS A FRESHMAN AND WAS ABLE TO EARN A PARTIAL SCHOLARSHIP. BY MY SENIOR YEAR AND THAT WAS IN A LARGE PART THANKS TO TITLE -- NINE I MANY OF THE OLYMPIC SPORT ATHLETES I COMPUTED WITH AND MET DURING MY ATHLETIC CAREER. WERE ALSO ON PARTIAL. TO KNOW -- SCHOLARSHIPS AS WELL. AND THESE ATHLETES WENT ON TO REPRESENT THEIR COUNTRY IN THE OLYMPICS DURING THEIR UNDERGRADUATE CAREER. AND SOME OF THEM HAD TO MAKE THIS HARD DECISION -- WHETHER TO FOREGO THE OPPORTUNITY TO CAPITALIZE ON THE SMALL WINDOW THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT -- OR NO LONGER COMPETE FOR THEIR UNIVERSITY OR OF FINISH THEIR EDUCATION [inaudible] SO AFTER. GRADUATION -- I WAS INVITED TO TRAIN WITH THE US ROWING NATIONAL TEAM. AND IT TOOK ME TWO YEARS TO EARN A SPOT. ON OLYMPIC. AND SO THAT MEANT I WENT TWO YEARS WITHOUT A STIPEND OR HEALTH INSURANCE -- SO. I THE COMPENSATION FOR MY NAME AND LIKENESS DURING MY AND SEE A BELAY -- CAREER WHICH WE ACTUALLY ALSO ONE TWO AND THREE BLADE CHAMPIONSHIPS -- IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A SIGNIFICANT HELP DURING THAT TIME AS I WAS BUILDING MY NEXT CAREER AS A I GUESS YOU COULD SAY. THAT AN AMATEUR PROFESSIONAL ATHLETES -- THERE ARE MANY OTHER ATHLETES THAT DON'T HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO CONTINUE THEIR SPORT -- AFTER COLLEGE GRADUATION GRADUATION. BUT THEY ALSO COMMITTED THESE LONG. HARD HOURS HONING THEIR SKILLS TO REPRESENT THEIR SCHOOL. WHILE THEIR CLASSMATES WERE ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF INTERNSHIPS AND JOBS DURING THIS TIME. AND I SEE THIS ACTUALLY QUITE FREQUENTLY NOW IS AYE MENTORING A LOT OF OTHER STUDENT ATHLETES AND THEY'RE HAVING A HARD TIME GETTING JOBS BECAUSE THEIR RESUMES AREN'T AS COMPETITIVE -- THEY DID NOT HAVE THE EMPLOYMENT EXPERIENCE THAT THERE. COHORTS -- AND THEIR CLASSMATES DEAD BECAUSE THEY WERE DOING THEIR FULL TIME JOB AS AN ATHLETE -- SO I KNOW. WE TYPICALLY THINK OF THESE HOW HIGH PROFILE SPORTS AS THE BENEFICIARIES OF COMPENSATION -- FOR THE NAME IN NIGHT AT NAME AND LIKENESS BUT I JUST WANT TO BRING ATTENTION TO ANOTHER SIGNIFICANT POPULATION OF ATHLETES THAT COULD BENEFIT. FROM THE ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL SUPPORT -- NOT ONLY TO MAINTAIN YOU KNOW THE OPPORTUNITY COMPETE FOR THEIR SCHOOL BUT ALSO TO SUPPORT THEIR TRANSITION FOR THEIR FUTURE CAREER ASPIRATIONS THANK YOU [inaudible] GOOD MORNING. CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR INVITING ME TO SPEAK MY NAME IS LEONARD SIMON I AM A LAWYER IN SAN DIEGO. A LAW PROFESSOR. IN SAN DIEGO AS WELL I'VE TAUGHT SPORTS IN THE LAW AT THE UNIVERSITY OF SAN DIEGO FOR THE LAST. DOZEN YEARS AND ALSO TAUGHT AT USC AND MY ALMA MATER DUKE UNIVERSITY -- I'M HERE AS AN INTERESTED CITIZEN I'M NOT A LOBBYIST NO ONE ASKED ME TO COME HOME AND NO ONE BUT ME HOPE THE HOTEL ROOM OR AIRPLANE TICKET I'M HERE. BECAUSE I BELIEVE IN WHAT -- WHAT CENTER SKINNER AND ASSEMBLYMAN BRADFORD HAVE PROPOSED THAT I HAVE FOR SEVERAL YEARS I'VE TAUGHT AMATEURISM -- AND NCAA REGULATION FOR THOSE DOZEN YEARS AND AS TIME HAS PASSED AND PEOPLE OF SU THE NCAA MANY MANY TIMES. IT IS COME TO ME THAT THE PROPER COMPROMISE. OF THE DISPUTE OVER PAY FOR PLAY IS EXACTLY. WHAT THIS BILL [inaudible] IT'S THE BILL IS IS IS APPROPRIATE -- FOR SEVERAL REASONS ONE IS THAT IT'S FAIR AND IT'S QUITE CONSISTENT WITH CALIFORNIA LAW WHICH IS UNDERMINED. BY THE NCAA CALIFORNIA LAW RECOGNIZES INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. IT RECOGNIZES THE NAME IMAGE AND LIKENESS AS A AS A RIGHT THAT ALL OF US HAVE ALL OF US CAN MONETIZE HER NAME'S IMAGES AND LIKE IT'S AS IF THEY'RE WORTH ANYTHING MINE ISN'T WORTH MUCH. OTHERS ARE WORTH A WHOLE LOT MORE. BUT AN ATHLETE WHO WISHES TO GO TO COLLEGE WHICH I THINK IT'S SOMETHING WE TRY TO ENCOURAGE. CANNOT MONETIZE -- CANNOT MONETIZE HIS OR HER NAME IMAGE AND LIKENESS AT RISK OF LOSING. COLLEGE EDUCATION SO WERE WERE UNDERMINING CALIFORNIA LAW THE CURRENT STATUS QUO DISCOURAGES EDUCATION. SOMETHING THAT I DON'T THINK CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE WANTS TO DO IT DISCOURAGES STUDENTS FROM GOING SCHOOL. DISCOURAGES THEM FROM STAYING. AT SCHOOL BECAUSE MANY OF THE BEST STUDENTS WITH THE BIGGEST BIGGEST NAMES AND MANY OF THE OTHER STUDENTS WITH THE JUST THE ROLE PLAYERS AND THE NON REVENUE SPORTS. REPORT. MANY OF THEM WERE JUST MIDDLE CLASS GOING TO COLLEGE IS EXPENSIVE. AND AS HAS BEEN SAID. EARLIER. A SCHOLARSHIP DOESN'T PROVIDE EVERYTHING THERE ON A CAMPUS WHERE OTHER PEOPLE HAVE SPENDING MONEY THERE ARE OTHER THINGS ONE WOULD LIKE TO DO THERE ARE TRAINING COSTS. AND THEY HAVE NO ACCESS TO ANY MONEY OTHER THAN EXACTLY WHAT THE UNIVERSITY PROVIDES THAT. THIS IS A SUBSTANTIAL DISINCENTIVE TO GO TO SCHOOL OR TO STAY IN SCHOOL THE YOUNG LADY PLAYING SOCCER NAMES A LIBYA MOULTRIE. SHE'S FOURTEEN SHE'S ALREADY QUITE WELL KNOWN FOR HER SOCCER SHOULD NEVER GO TO COLLEGE. BECAUSE SHE HIRED AN AGENT. AND SHE'S MONETIZING HER SOCIAL MEDIA PRESENCE IN ORDER TO PAY FOR THE TRAINING THAT SHE NEEDS AS A AS A WOULD BE. FUTURE PROFESSIONAL ATHLETE OR TO FUTURE MEMBER OF THE U. S. WOMEN'S SOCCER TEAM SO IT FOURTEEN SHE'S BEEN FORCED TO CHOOSE BETWEEN. FOLLOWING HER DREAM AND HER PHENOMENAL TALENT AT FOURTEEN OR GOING TO COLLEGE AND SHE'S PERMANENTLY INELIGIBLE. THERE'S NOTHING WE CAN DO TO BRING IT BACK I DON'T THINK BUT THERE ARE A LOT MORE OUT THERE LIKE LIKE HER. MATTHEW BOWLING IS AN EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD IN TEXAS WHO IS THE FASTEST U. S. HIGH SCHOOL SPRINTER ANYBODY'S SEEN IN A DECADE. HE HAS TO DECIDE THIS SUMMER WHETHER YOU WANT TO GO TO UNIVERSITY GEORGIA WHICH IS OFFERED HIM A SCHOLARSHIP. OR HE WANTS TO TRAIN PROFESSIONALLY AND GET READY FOR THE TOKYO OLYMPICS. THAT'S HIS CHOICE HE NEEDS THE FUNDING FROM NAME IMAGE AND LIKENESS FROM SOCIAL MEDIA FROM SHOE CONTRACTS IN ORDER TO PAY FOR THE COACHING WHICH MIGHT GET HIM READY. SO YOU CAN GET AN EDUCATION OR YOU CAN FOLLOW HIS DREAM. I MAKE A VERY PERSONAL TO ME BECAUSE I'M NOT A CALIFORNIA GOLDEN BEAR I'M TO DUKE BLUE DEVIL. AND IF YOU NOTICED YEAH SIGNED WILLIAMSON WHEN PRO TRUE. OTHERS WHEN PRO ONE GUY DIDN'T ON THAT FANTASTIC FRESHMAN TEAM TRADE JONES. STATE IS GONNA BE A SOPHOMORE NEXT YEAR PLAYING BASKETBALL WHY? I CAN ONLY TELL YOU ONE FACT THAT MIGHT BE SIGNIFICANT WHICH IS THAT HIS BROTHER IS A PROFESSIONAL BASKETBALL PLAYER AND HIS FAMILY IS PROBABLY WHAT YOU WOULD CALL UPPER MIDDLE CLASS HE GOT TO CHOOSE. HE CHOSE. THE STATE GET A FURTHER EDUCATION AND MAYBE MAKE HIS GAME A LITTLE BETTER. EIGHTEEN YEARS AGO DO CAT A POINT GUARD SAME POSITION WILL AVERY. MIKE SHE CHESKY A COACH YOU PROBABLY HEARD OF RECOMMENDED HE STAY FOR ONE OR TWO MORE YEARS AND HE LEFT APOLOGIZED TO THE COACH. AND THE SYSTEM IN SAID. MY MOTHER DOESN'T HAVE ANY FOOD YOU CAN'T PAY THE RENT I CAN'T BE HERE ANY LONGER I'M SIGNING A CONTRACT. THAT'S NOT A POSITION YOU WANT TO PUT YOUNG PEOPLE IN CHOOSING BETWEEN AN EDUCATION. AND AND TAKING CARE OF THEIR FAMILIES ARE TAKING CARE OF THEMSELVES SO THE RULE REALLY DISCOURAGES EDUCATION AND FORCES UNFORTUNATE DECISIONS. OTHERS HAVE ALREADY SAID THIS IS TOTALLY INCONSISTENT WITH HOW WE TREAT. ARTISTS MUSICIANS AND ACTORS ON CAMPUS THEY CAN THEY CAN COMPETE IN NATIONAL INTERNATIONAL COMPETITIONS -- WITHOUT WORRYING ABOUT WHETHER THEY'RE MAKING ANY MONEY ON THE SIDE -- I THINK IT RAISES VERY SERIOUS AND I TRUST PROBLEMS BECAUSE NO UNIVERSITY COULD EVEN MAKE ITS OWN DECISION ON THIS ASSEMBLY DECIDED TO EXPERIMENT. AND DO WHAT SENATOR SKINNER HAS PROPOSED. THEY WOULD BE IN TROUBLE THERE BUT THE UNIVERSITIES ARE MAKING THE DECISIONS THE NCAA IS. FINALLY I WOULD SAY. THE BILL IS VERY BALANCED. IT DOESN'T REQUIRE SCHOOLS TO PAY SALARIES. IT'S NOT EFFECTIVE TOMORROW IT'S GOT A THREE YEAR WINDOW AND THERE IS -- LOTS OF ROOM TO GET THIS DONE LOTS OF TIME TO GET THIS DONE AND LOTS OF TIME. UP FOR EVERYONE TO ADJUST TO A CALIFORNIA. IN THIS CASE IT'S NOT THE ONLY STATE LOOKING AT THIS COLORADO IS LOOKING AT A WASHINGTON LOOKING AT BUT CALIFORNIA SHOULD DO AS IT DOES IN MANY. AREAS AND SHOULD LEAVE SHOULD GET OUT AHEAD. I WOULD URGE ECONOMIC THROUGH THE BILL IN THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR PATIENCE THANK YOU ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT PLEASE COME FORWARD STATE YOUR NAME AND YOUR AFFILIATION PLEASE. MY NAME IS OLIVIA SMILLA REPRESENTING THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA STUDENT ASSOCIATION AND WE ARE IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU. NEIL SWEENEY THE US TWENTY VICE PRESIDENT OF THE U. A. W.

GOOD MORNING CAME WHEN DEAN FROM THE ALLIANCE FROM BOYS TO MEN OF COLOR AT POLICY LINK PROUD CO SPONSORS IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. THANK YOU. OF ANY. WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION PLEASE COME FORWARD. TO HAVE ENOUGH SEAT [inaudible] MORE. CAN I IN A STUDIO WITH ASSISTANCE SUPPORT. TO VIEW THE SEATS TO THE OPPOSITION WITNESSES SO. WHICH WILL PUT YOU ON A TO START THE GOOD MORNING -- MY NAME IS AB FEE AND I SERVE AS THE ATHLETIC DIRECTOR AT LONG BEACH STATE UNIVERSITY -- AND WE APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH ALL OF YOU TODAY. I AM HERE IN OPPOSITION OF THIS BILL AND BRIEFLY WANT TO SHARE MY THOUGHTS AND CONCERNS THERE ARE MANY POTENTIAL UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF THIS BILL. THE CO AUTHORS PAINT ONE POSSIBLE SCENARIO. BUT I WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK TO ANOTHER POSSIBLE SCENARIO WHERE THE OPPORTUNITY TO COMPETE FOR AND STATE CHAMPIONSHIPS GOES AWAY. LONG BEACH STATE JUST HAPPENS TO BE THE HOME OF THE BACK TO BACK DEFENDING NATIONAL CHAMPION MEN'S VOLLEYBALL PROGRAM. IF CALIFORNIA CREATES RULES THAT DRASTICALLY CONTRAST CURRENT AND STATE PRINCIPLES AND THE FABRIC OF AMATEURISM THE BECOMES AN INHERENT ISSUE OF TWO WORLDS THAT CANNOT CO EXIST. I FEAR THE DISTINCT POSSIBILITY OF A SCENARIO WHERE CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS COULD BE EXPELLED FOR WILLFUL BREAKING OF NCAA RULES. WHICH IS DIRECTLY LINKED TO WHAT THE NCAA REFERS TO AS A LACK OF INSTITUTIONAL CONTROL. SHE CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS BE EXPELLED THE VERY STUDENT ATHLETES THE BILL IS INTENDED TO ASSIST WOULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. DUE TO POSSIBLE LOSS OF SCHOLARSHIP OPPORTUNITIES DUE TO SHATTERING OF NCAA ATHLETICS IN CALIFORNIA. I WOULD ADD THE CONVERSATION WE'RE HAVING TODAY IS AN IMPORTANT. ONE AND WE ARE ALL FOCUSED ON ENHANCING THE STUDENT ATHLETE EXPERIENCE. HOWEVER MY PERSONAL OPINION IS THIS IS THE WRONG MECHANISM. TO ACHIEVE THAT GOAL AND ULTIMATELY DOES MORE HARM THAN GOOD. THE MOST IMPORTANT EVENTS THAT WE HOST TEACHER AT LONG BEACH STATE UNIVERSITY IS COMMENCEMENT. AND I FEAR THAT MANY FIRST GENERATIONS DO NATALIE IT'S COULD LOSE THE OPPORTUNITY. FOR THE MOST IMPORTANT AND WHAT I DESCRIBE AS PRICELESS A COLLEGE DEGREE. THAT DEGREE CARRIES THEM FORWARD. AND CAN HELP THEM ACHIEVE THEIR GOALS DREAMS OR ASPIRATIONS. AND IT IS LIFE CHANGING. IN CLOSING. I'D LIKE TO THANK YOU ALL AGAIN FOR ALLOWING US TO EXPRESS OUR CONCERNS. THANK YOU THANK YOU [inaudible] MORNING PANELIST. MY NAME IS LATONYA SHEFFIELD AND I AM COACH OF MEN AND WOMEN'S TRACK AND FIELD AT LONG BEACH STATE. I OPPOSE IT LEGISLATION BECAUSE IT. IT ALIGNS WITH THE POTENTIAL -- TO BE HARSHLY LIMITING -- TO OUR OUR STUDENT ATHLETES. IT CAN LIMIT THEM IN MANY WAYS. FIRST IN THE COMPETITIVE OPPORTUNITIES. EVEN BY SPORT. AND CERTAINLY BY GENDER. DEFINITELY BY GENDER. I CHAIR THE DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION COMMITTEE -- AT LONG BEACH STATE AND OUR ATHLETIC DEPARTMENT. AND WHAT ARE COR. MOTIVATION IS TO INCLUDE TO WELCOME. AND THIS BILL IMMEDIATELY IMMEDIATELY. IT'S A DIVIDE. IT DIVIDES BECAUSE IT'S MEN. FOOTBALL IT'S MEN BASKETBALL IT'S MEN BASEBALL THAT WILL LITERALLY GET THE IMMEDIATE. THE IMMEDIATE. ADVANTAGE. WHERE OUR MINOR SPORTS? SUCH IS. OUR STUDENTS AT THE STUDENT ATHLETES THAT I COACH. THERE MIGHT THAT TO MINORITY SPORT IN TRACK AND FIELD. I HEARD SOMEONE SAY TODAY THAT. THE EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES WOULD -- BE COMPROMISED. I SAY THAT THE RIGOR OF GOING PRO. AND ALL THE HOURS THAT IT TAKES. THAT IS THE LIMITING FACTOR. YOU HEAR ALL THE TIME HOW ATHLETES ARE GOING BACK TO SCHOOL AND EARNING THEIR DEGREE I'M NOT SUGGESTING THAT THEY HAVE TO WAIT. I'M SUGGESTING THAT THERE IS A RECORD THAT IS IMMENSE I'M AN OLYMPIAN. I'M ALSO AN OLYMPIC COACH. SO I UNDERSTAND THAT OUR POOL OF ATHLETES THEY COME FROM THE UNIVERSITY THAT IS OUR POOL OF ATHLETES. AND THOSE ATHLETES. I SPECIFICALLY COACH THE SPRINT AS WELL AS THE HURDLES. THAT SEEM TO HAVE THE LARGER MINORITY BASE. THESE ARE KIDS THAT WERE JUST LIKE ME [inaudible] GREW UP. NOT NECESSARILY HAVING A FULL SCHOLARSHIP WHAT WAS IN THE ELITE ATHLETE BUT HAD TO WORK OUR WAY. WE HAD TO WORK OUR WAY. SO MY LIKENESS MY BRANDING WASN'T AN OPTION. IT WASN'T UNTIL. I WENT ON TO THE NCAA CHAMPIONSHIP AND ONE THAT PERHAPS THERE WAS AN OPPORTUNITY. BUT IF I COMPARE MYSELF. TO A FOOTBALL ATHLETE A BASKETBALL ATHLETE. OR BASEBALL ATHLETE MY LIKENESS WOULD STILL NOT ALLOW ME. THE COST OF LIVING NOR MY FAMILY. SO I'M SPEAKING TO BACK GROUP OF FOLK. THAT LOWER LEVEL MADE MAKE ME IT MADE MAJOR TYPE OF GROUP. AND LONG BEACH STATE IS DEFINITELY A MID MAJOR SPORT WE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO CONTENT. WILL PUT OUR STUDENT ATHLETES PERHAPS EVEN IN A DEFICIT IN THEIR FAMILIES AND THE DEFICIT FINANCIAL DEFICIT. IF CALIFORNIA SAYS. THAT WE'RE WE'RE GOING TO PASS THIS LEGISLATION. THEN THE NC A A SAYS YOU GUYS ARE NO LONGER A MEMBER OF WHATEVER VIOLATIONS THAT WE HAVE. HAVE HAVE INDULGED. WHERE THOSE ATHLETES GOING TO CALL? THE PUT THEIR FAMILIES IN THE SITUATION WHICH THEY HAVE TO LOOK FURTHER. OUT OF STATE USING OUT OF STATE COSTS. SO I JUST WANTED. TO HAVE YOU THINK ABOUT THAT IT'S NOT THAT I DON'T BELIEVE. THAT ATHLETES SHOULD BE COMPENSATED. FOR THEIR OWN LIKENESS. I'M AN ATHLETE. THROUGH AND THROUGH I BELIEVE THAT. BUT JUST NOT IN THIS MANNER. PERHAPS MAYBE NOT NECESSARILY AT THE STATE MANA BUT MAYBE. MAYBE AT THE NCAA. AND LET'S NOT PUT A TORCH ON IN CA AND THEN WE'D BE CASUALTIES. LOW KICK FROM LOS ANGELES. INNER CITY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH COACH. AND AND AN EXCELLENT. HI MY NAME IS THE MY MCDONALD -- FORMER SOCCER PLAYER ABOUT A MONTH REMOVED AT THIS POINT FROM THE LONG FROM ON THE STATE -- AND I'M HERE TO OPPOSE SB TWO OH SIX FROM THE SOON ATHLETE PERSPECTIVE JUST BECAUSE IT HURTS MY OPPORTUNITIES AFFORDED TO ME THROUGH THE ATHLETIC PROGRAM. MY TH	C AGE BUT AID PACKAGE HAS HELPED ME ATTENDED TO MY DEGREE AS WELL AS MANY OF MY FELLOW STUDENT ATHLETES. THROUGH THE ATHLETICS EXPERIENCE I'VE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO BECOME A CITY A CS YOU'LL BE SENATOR AT LARGE. ARE BIG WEST CONFERENCE -- SENT STUDENT ATHLETE ADVISORY COMMITTEE. A REPRESENTATIVE AND ENGAGE AS A STUDENT LEADER ALL THROUGHOUT OUR CAMPUS. I HAVE ALSO HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO TRAVEL TO PANAMA ON A SERVICE TRIP ALONG SIDE MY THOUGHT IT PROGRAM FAMILY. AS A WOMAN OF COLOR ON THE SOCCER FIELD I AM A MINORITY IN THE MOST IN MOST SECTORS THAT I ENTER. YEAH THE L. B. S. U. ATHLETIC PROGRAM HAS GIVEN ME THE OPPORTUNITY THAT I MAY NOT HAVE DONE ON MY OWN WITHOUT PLAYING THE SPORT THAT I LOVE. WITH THE PASSING OF SB TWO OH SIX I FEAR THAT WOMEN THAT COME AFTER ME. AND THE POSSIBILITIES BEING FAR MORE LIMITED THAN OPPORTUNITIES I'VE HAD -- IT WAS ALSO MENTIONED THAT. WHAT LIKE WHAT ATHLETE WOULD NOT LIKE TO BE PAID FOR BY LIKE MISSING COMPENSATION? BUT AS WE SEE RIGHT NOW IN THE WOMEN'S WORLD CUP THOSE WOMEN ARE FIGHTING TO BE PAID THE EQUAL AMOUNTS SO WHAT IT WHAT ABOUT A GIRL FROM. WHO WENT TO THE LOCAL COLLEGE? I'M FROM LONG BEACH CALIFORNIA I AM AT LONG BEACH THROUGH AND THROUGH GIRL. LOVE THE FIVE SIX TWO SO WHAT MAKES YOU THINK IF WOMEN. THE PROFESSIONAL LEVEL. WOULD GET PAID THE SAME THEY WOULD LIKE AYE I CAN'T GO TO MY THEY'RE NOT GOING TO GIVE ME ANY MONEY IS BASICALLY WHAT I'M SAYING. I'M NOT GONNA MAKE ANY MONEY OFF MY IMAGE OR LIKENESS BECAUSE I'M NOTHING. TO YOU ALL. I AM. I LOVE MYSELF. BUT I'M WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY IS THAT THE WOMAN AT THE PROFESSIONAL LEVEL CANNOT GET A PROPER PLAYING SURFACE TO PLAY ON AND IF THEY ARE NOT AFFORDED THE SAME OPPORTUNITIES THAT WE GIVE OUR MAN THAT WE GIVE. THE U. S. MEN'S NATIONAL TEAM AND THEY'RE FIGHTING FOR THE SAME. LEG UP WHEN THEY ARE ABOUT TO BE FOUR TIME WORLD FULL WORLD CUP CHAMPIONS. I'M NOT GONNA BE AFFORDED THE SAME. THE SAME RIGHTS. SO WHERE WERE PLAYING ON THE BACK OF THESE MEN MAJOR STUDENT ATHLETES AND MY AID PACKAGE HAS -- TREMENDOUSLY HELPED ME. I STILL HAD TO WORK BUT ASKED MENTAL HELP HELP ME AND I'M ENTERING THE WORKFORCE WITH. A BACHELORS OF ARTS AND I'M GOING TO GO GET A MASTERS. BUT I'M NOT IN ANY DEBT. AND THAT'S SO NICE THAT'S SO NICE AND IN COMPARISON TO MY COUNTERPARTS. MIKE THAT THEY HAVE MINIMAL DEBT AND COMPARED TO SOME OF OUR NON ATHLETIC COUNTERPARTS THANK YOU GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THANK YOU FOR BRINGING UP THE EQUAL PAY DE SHOE. TO FALL ELECTION THOUGH WITH A FEW. TO IT WAS A A POSSIBLE WITHOUT -- ANY COMPENSATION LIKE TO GET A PICTURE WITH YOU LATER. ALL RIGHT BEFORE -- BY CALL ON THE ADDITIONAL WITNESSES AND OPPOSITION WE DO HAVE A QUORUM SO WOULD ASK THE SECRETARY. TO CALL THE ROLL PLEASE.

FOR GOOD MORNING ALEX GRAYS WITH THE ASSOCIATION INDEPENDENT CALIFORNIA COLLEGES UNIVERSITIES REPRESENT EIGHTY FOUR PRIVATE NONPROFIT SCHOOLS IN THE STATE NINE AT THE DIVISION ONE LEVEL NINE DIVISION TO LEVEL IN THIRTEEN AT THE DIVISION THREE LEVEL NANCY TWO WAY -- IF I COULD JUST ADD THAT -- YOU KNOW OUR INSTITUTIONS LOOK AT THIS FROM A PERSPECTIVE OF IF THIS GOES THROUGH NEEDING TO TAKE A UTILITARIAN. PERSPECTIVE AN APPROACH TO THE THE RISKS THAT -- POSES TO OUR STUDENT ATHLETES AND WHAT WE BELIEVE WILL BENEFIT A VERY SMALL PERCENTAGE OF STUDENT ATHLETES -- WEIGHED AGAINST THE POTENTIAL HARM TO MANY OF OUR STUDENT ATHLETES -- I THINK THERE'S SOME OTHER THINGS ARE BROUGHT UP THAT THAT CHARACTERIZES -- NO LONGER ACCURATE IN TERMS OF THE NC TO A BUT WOULD BE HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS AND DISCUSS THAT FURTHER [inaudible] THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS JANET LOW BECAUSE REPRESENTING THE UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WE ARE IN A I SEE SEE YOU MEMBER SCHOOL. AND H. STAND HERE IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL I JUST WANTED TO KNOW TO WE DID WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE IN TWENTY TWELVE TO PASS A STUDENT ATHLETE BILL OF RIGHTS. AT THAT TIME OUR FOOTBALL PROGRAMS GRADUATION RATE WAS AT THANK YOU THANK YOU. ENTER MARTINEZ CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY WHICH YOUR OPPOSED THANK YOU. RYAN MAC LANEY TESTIFYING ON BEHALF OF THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICERS OF CALIFORNIA'S COMMUNITY COLLEGES IN A CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE ATHLETIC ASSOCIATION IN OPPOSITION [inaudible] THANK YOU. MORNING TYLER I YOU ARMY AFTER THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA RESPECTFUL IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU. THANK YOU. RUNNING FEEL LEVELS WITH STANFORD UNIVERSITY IN OPPOSITION I DO JUST WANT TO NOTE THAT I THINK MANY OF THE COLLEGES WOULD SHARE SOME OF THESE CONCERNS REGARDING NAME IMAGE AND LIKENESS. WE'RE JUST CONCERNED AND OPPOSE THE PROCESS SO IN IN AND THE REST THAT IT PLACES ON INSTITUTIONS AND STUDENTS -- ABILITY TO PLAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU ARE ON UNDERSTAND A WOULD TO HAVE A LATE OPPOSITION LET HER. THE SERGEANTS COUNTLESS PASSION ALL. AT THIS POINT -- LIKE -- TO OPEN UP -- FOR DETAILS FOR ANY COMMENTS QUESTIONS. MOM. I MEAN YOU MEMBERS. ONLY GOOD ALL. THANK YOU. AND THANK YOU. TO SENATOR SKINNER AND BRADFORD -- FOR BRINGING THIS HIGHLY NON CONTROVERSIAL BILLED TO OUT. AT I ACTUALLY HAD A QUESTION -- FOR THE ON POSITION BEFORE I MAKE MY COMMENTS AND I WANTED TO KNOW THAT -- DO STUDENTS WHO ARE ON PARTIAL SCHOLARSHIP OR WHO ARE RECEIVING NO SCHOLARSHIP AT ALL WHO ARE ATHLETES DO THEY ALSO HAVE TO ABIDE BY THE NC DOUBLE A RULES [inaudible] YES [inaudible] OKAY -- SO I'M. GOING I HAVE TO SAY I REPRESENT -- WENT TO A GREAT SCHOOL THAT HAS -- A PHENOMENAL -- ATHLETIC PROGRAM AND REPRESENT A GREAT SCHOOL -- THAT HAS A PHENOMENAL ATHLETIC PROGRAM. OKAY -- AND HAVE HEARD FROM THEM -- AND I'VE ALSO HEARD FROM THE STUDENT ATHLETES AT THOSE SCHOOLS AS WELL AND I I DO WANT TO JUST SAY THAT I THINK WE'RE CONFLATING SO MANY ISSUES WHEN YOU SORT OF TALK ABOUT THIS -- THE YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT JUST KIND OF EQUITY -- ON CAMPUSES BETWEEN STUDENT ATHLETES AND NON STUDENT ATHLETES YOU'RE HAVING CONVERSATIONS AROUND INCOME AND DISPARITY -- AND AND WHO ACTUALLY NEEDS A SCHOLARSHIP YOU'RE HAVING CONVERSATIONS ABOUT IF STUDENTS ARE EMPLOYEES OR NOT I MEAN I THINK THE NORTHWESTERN RULING WAS A GREAT EXAMPLE AN INDICATIVE OF THE CONVERSATIONS THAT WE ARE HAVING -- ACROSS THE COUNTRY ABOUT YOU KNOW OUR STUDENT ATHLETES ALREADY. ARE PAID TO PLAY YOU KNOW. THEY HAVE -- TO SHOW UP AND DO THE TRAINING AND WORK WITH THEIR COLLEAGUES THEY HAVE TO GO THROUGH THIS REGIMENT OR ELSE. AND MANY OF THEM LOOK A CERTAIN KIND OF WAY AND MANY OF THEM COME FROM -- CERTAIN COMMUNITIES AND THEN YOU HAVE AND AND WE ALSO KNOW THAT SOME SOME OF THAT -- SPORTS PLOT PAY. FOR NOT ONLY THE OTHER SPORTS BUT ALSO PAY FOR ALL OF THE OTHER THINGS THAT REVENUE IS JUST NOT BEING GENERATED TO COVER ON THESE CAMPUSES. AND THEN YOU HAVE THE IN CA. YOU KNOW IN AS I HAVE READ THROUGH MULTIPLE PAGES OF ARTICLES ON THE NC A A AND ITS PUNISHMENTS AND THE PROHIBITIONS AND HOW FOLKS OF LOST ELIGIBILITY. YOU KNOW IT'S RIGHT OUT OF THE GODFATHER MOVIE. YOU KNOW AND HAVING CONVERSATIONS AROUND -- THOSE KINDS OF PROHIBITIONS AN ELIGIBILITY I THINK THE FACT THAT -- BAN IN YOU KNOW -- HAD TO GET THE CALL FROM HIS FRIEND WHO'S PLAYING THIS VIDEO GAME AND SAYS HEY I'M ACTUALLY PLAYING A GAME AND THIS IS YOU. YOU KNOW AND HAD TO TAKE THAT TO COURT. BECAUSE HE HE HAD NOT BENEFITED FINANCIALLY FROM HIS AMATEUR CAREER [inaudible] RIGHT. NOT TO MENTION ALL OF THESE OTHERS I MEAN AND THE LIST GOES ON AND ON DONNIE EDWARDS. WE HAD REGGIE BUT I MEAN ALL OF THESE FOLKS WE HAVE TO HAVE A SERIOUS CONVERSATION ABOUT A HOW THE NC A A AND BY THE WAY I THINK THE NCAA IS ACTUALLY A MEMBERSHIP ORGANIZATION YES COMPRISED OF THE SCHOOLS AND SO IN MY MIND. JUST LIKE A UNION. THE SCHOOLS ACTUALLY HAVE THE POWER IN THE PROGRAMS THAT ARE THE MOST SUCCESSFUL HAVE THE POWER IN PERSUADING THE IN CA TO REALLY THINK ABOUT. THE RULINGS THAT IT WANTS TO GIVE OUT. I ALSO THINK THERE'S SOME YOU KNOW WE SHOULD KIND OF BE TALKING ABOUT THAT I'VE HEARD ABOUT THIS COMPETITIVE DISADVANTAGE THAT SCHOOLS WILL FACE IN CALIFORNIA. HOW OTHER SCHOOLS AND OTHER STATES WILL SORT OF POACH THESE ATHLETES AND TAKE THEM BECAUSE OF THIS RULING? AND I ACTUALLY SEE IT IN ANOTHER WAY -- I THINK THAT THERE WILL BE A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE HELD BY THE SCHOOLS IN CALIFORNIA. WHO SAY IF YOU COME TO ONE OF OUR COLLEGES WE ARE GOING? TO WE HAVE THIS STRUCTURE SET UP IN PLACE. WHERE -- IF IF YOU ARE ABLE TO BENEFIT OFF OF YOUR LIKENESS IN YOUR IMAGE YOU CAN. MANY OF THE YOUNG FOLKS NOWADAYS ARE TRYING TO FIND WAYS -- TO EARN ADDITIONAL REVENUE -- AND TO BENEFIT FROM THEIR BRANDING I CERTAINLY DON'T THINK THAT IN CA DOUBLE AGE SHOULD BE RESPONSIBLE AND HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO DECIDE THAT IMAGE AND HOW IT'S USED. AND I ALSO BELIEVE THAT THIS IS BECAUSE THE NCA A IS SAYING WELL YOU KNOW IF WE ALLOW THESE ATHLETES TO BENEFIT AND HAVE THIS COMPENSATION THEN WE ARE GOING TO LOSE VIEWERS WERE GONNA LOSE REVENUE. BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE NOT GOING TO WATCH BECAUSE THEY'RE GOING TO SAY THESE ARE BECAUSE I PROFESSIONALS. YOU KNOW IN MY MIND THAT SORT OF I CAN TO SORT OF PRICE GOUGING -- AND SO I JUST HAVE SIRIUS SIRIUS CONCERNS AND I AM HOPEFUL JUST LIKE I HEARD SENATOR PAN SAY THAT WE CAN HAVE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT HOW OUR SCHOOLS ARE ACTUALLY GOING TO BE HELPING AND SUPPORTING THE STUDENTS. RATHER THAN TRYING TO FIGURE OUT YOU KNOW HOW TO SORT OF A BITE BY ARBITRARY DECISIONS COMING FROM THE NCAA AS IT RELATES TO THEIR OWN ABILITY TO MAKE NEW REVENUE. AND SO I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENTS [inaudible] QUESTION. SURE WELL FIRST I WANT TO THANK ALL THE WITNESSES FOR COMING HERE TODAY AND I'M SPEAKING AND SHARING YOUR VERY IMPRESSIVE STORIES -- WAS NOT A STUDENT ATHLETE I WAS ON THE DEBATE TEAM I DON'T KNOW IF THAT COUNTS. A SIMILAR RIGHT -- YEAH YEAH. YEAH -- YOU KNOW I I THIS IS ONE OF THOSE DIFFICULT BILLS WERE EVERYBODY WANTS TO DO THE RIGHT THING FOR OUR STUDENTS BUT PEOPLE HAVE DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES BASED ON KIND OF WHAT THEIR PATH HAS BEEN. SO -- I'M VERY HOPEFUL THAT THE BILL'S AUTHORS WHO ARE VERY PASSIONATE ABOUT HELPING STUDENTS ARE GOING TO CONTINUE THE DISCUSSION AS THIS GOES FORWARD -- TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ACHIEVE THE GOALS OF FINDING WAYS TO GIVE TO OPEN UP OUR OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE STUDENTS -- WHILE ALSO PROTECTING YOU KNOW ALL OF THE PROGRAMS THAT YOU HAVE SPOKEN SO ELOQUENTLY ABOUT NEEDING TO PROTECT YOU KNOW I'LL JUST ADD THE COMMENT THAT THERE IS SOMETHING. YOU KNOW SADDAM THIS CONVERSATION ABOUT. STUDENTS WHO. ARE MISSY. ARM. THESE SPORTS AS KIND OF THEIR TICKET INTO THE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM OR TO YOU KNOW A MUCH BETTER LIFE -- NOT EVERY STUDENTS GOING TO END UP BEING AN ELITE ATHLETE A PROFESSIONAL ATHLETE -- AND YOU KNOW HAVING NO WATCHED THE WONDERFUL DOCUMENTARY SOME YEARS AGO WAS HOOP DREAMS YOU KNOW THERE THERE'S A SAID SORT OF A SADNESS AND AS DESPERATION DOESN'T TO A LOT OF THIS. AND ALSO CERTAINLY SOME EXPLOITATION THAT HAPPENS WITH THE STUDENTS I'M WITH PROFESSIONAL ATHLETES -- THAT YOU KNOW MAKES ALL OF THIS A TON OF A DIFFICULT MORE DIFFICULT CONVERSATION AND GIVEN THAT IT'S OVERLAID WITH PEOPLE WHO JUST WANT TO EDUCATION I WANT A BETTER LIFE AND SOMETIMES HAVE TROUBLE ACHIEVING THAT. YOU KNOW I CAN'T HELP BUT THINK THAT PART OF OUR CONVERSATION ALSO HAS TO CONTINUE TO BE ABOUT HAVING TO OPEN HOW TO OPEN UP THOSE OPPORTUNITIES SO THAT MORE CALIFORNIA'S. CHILDREN CAN HAVE A GOOD COLLEGE EDUCATION AND THAT YOU KNOW FINANCES DON'T BECOME THAT BARRIER. AND YOU KNOW ON THE OTHER THING I WAS THINKING WAS THAT IT'S UNFAIR THAT. YOU KNOW ALL OF YOU HAVE -- TO BE WITH YOUR SUPPORT SEEN AS YOU KNOW KIND OF LESSER THEM YOU KNOW THAT WOMEN'S SPORTS ARE NOT GIVEN THE SAME ATTENTION AND IT -- AND OPPORTUNITIES AS MEN WHO PLAY SPORTS AND YOU KNOW WITH SOMEONE WITH A DAUGHTER YOU KNOW THAT SAD THAT SHE MAY END UP BEING AN ATHLETE WHO DOESN'T HAVE AS GOOD A PLAYING FIELD AS THE BOYS DO. SO THAT'S NO DIFFERENT CONVERSATION AND THIS BILL IS NOT GOING TO ADDRESS THAT -- AND YOU KNOW WE JUST HAVE TO KEEP WORKING TO MAKE SURE IT DOESN'T NEGATIVELY IMPACT WHAT YOU ALREADY HAVE AS YOU YOU KNOW AS YOU STATED THOSE CONCERNS SO I'M GOING TO SUPPORT THIS TODAY AND I'M. YOU KNOW LOOKING FOR DECEIVING SCENE A CONVERSATION BEFORE AND I HOPE THAT YOU ARE PART OF THAT CONVERSATION BECAUSE I KNOW THAT YOU WILL. YOU KNOW CONTINUE TO PUSH THIS INTO THE RIGHT PLACE SO THANKS AGAIN FOR BEING HERE. THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRIEDMAN AND DOCTOR CHOI. THANK YOU CHAIR. AND THE LISTENING [inaudible] TO JUST ME. WHAT SIZE SAW A E. AIR -- THE CORE QUESTION MEAN IS ONCE WE INACTIVE THIS KIND OF A LAW -- WE ARE CONFLICTING WITH THE NC DOUBLE A REGULATIONS. AND THE STUDENTS SO -- WILL GET HURT. AS LONG AS AT THE SCHOOL -- STAYS A AS A MEMBER AND THE MAYBE. EXPECTED -- SO WHAT. YOUR ORIGINAL INTENT IS. TO HELP STUDENTS ATHLETES. SO THAT THAT THEY WOULD BE ON THE SAME NAM. PLAYING FIELD DOT UP BASED UPON THE IMAGES OF WHAT LIKENESS. LIKE THE ANY OTHER STUDENTS HOWEVER. IF YOU'D ON WORK OUT. IN A DOORS SAID THE MEMBER INVESTED CELL. PHONE CONVINCED THE BLAZE INTO W. -- WOULD NOT CHANGE -- BUT THE LUCKILY -- HOPE YES THAT THAT THEY MAY COME UP WITH A SOME. A GUIDE Là M<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt; SOLUTION&lt;/c&gt;</u> BECAUSE SAW WHAT I READ IS THAT THAT THEY HAVE FORMED A WORKING TASK FORCE. AND THAT THEY ARE WORKING ON IT. AND THE YOUR BILL PROPOSES. THAT THE NOT EVEN THIS OF COURSE INTO EFFECT THE IS NOT GONNA BE IMPLEMENTED UNTIL. TWO THOUSAND TWENTY THREE THAT'S A QUITE A FEW YEARS. SO FROM NOW 1-220-00 WHATEVER NOT TWENTY THREE OF THE TASK FORCE TO MAY COME UP WITH IS SOME RECOMMENDATIONS. SO I WONDER WHY -- WE TRY TO CONFRONT WITH THE NC DOUBLE A AND A PUT THE ATHLETES IN FACT THE IN JEOPARDY OF THE FUTURE POTENTIAL. IN ALL OF POLL BECAUSE ONCE YOU VIOLATE UP FROM MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE OLD THE BED THE FROM JOINING. IN A FEW JOKES IN ALL PROTEINS. SO WHAT YOUR INTENT IS SAW. NOT SO WELL KNOWN. I SUPPORTED THE BECAUSE OF THE THE THE THE FIRST STEP IS -- TO TO I AM NOT IN THE COME UP WITH THE A WORK BURKE AGREEMENT WITH THE NC DOUBLE A RATHER THAN JUST A PUSHING. AND OF FIGHT AND UP BUT THE ATHLETES SO IN IN THE JEOPARDY -- THROUGH THE CHAIR IF I COULD RESPOND -- A COUPLE THINGS FIRST THERE WAS A VERY -- A VERY LIVELY AND I THOUGHT VERY PRODUCTIVE EXCHANGE AT THE SENATE ED COMMITTEE BETWEEN DOCTOR PAN AND THE REPRESENTATIVES OF COLLEGES WHERE HE ASTOR BERRIES REPRESENT OF THE COLLEGES. WHAT IS THE BOARD OF THE NCQA ART AREN'T YOU THE NC TWO WAY? AND THEY SAID YES IT IS MADE UP OF COLLEGES. AND SO IT IS ABSOLUTELY TRUE RIGHT NOW THAT THE NC TO A IS THREATENING CALIFORNIA AND WE HAVE REPRESENTATIVES OF OUR COLLEGES COMING. BECAUSE OF THIS CONCERN OF THAT THREAT BUT IT IS COLLEGES THREATENING THEMSELVES BECAUSE THE NC TWO EIGHT IS COLLEGES NOW. THE NC TWO EIGHT TRIES TO HIDE BEHIND THAT. AND YET THE COLLEGES THEMSELVES COULD PLAY A STRONG ROLE IN CHANGING THESE RULES. THE SP TWO OH SIX IS NOT THE VERY FIRST CONVERSATION AROUND THIS ISSUE THIS ISSUE HAS BEEN DOMINATING DISCUSSIONS WITH IN COLLEGE ATHLETICS FOR YEARS. AND THERE WAS PREVIOUS LEGISLATION THAT CALIFORNIA LOOKED AT BACK AS EARLY AS I BELIEVE. TWO THOUSAND NOW EACH TIME THE COLLEGES SAID YOU CAN'T PUT US AT A DISADVANTAGE THE NC TO A MAY RETALIATE IN THE NC TO A WILL CHANGE THEIR RULES. THE NC TO A HAS ONLY MINIMALLY CHANGE THEIR RULES AND THE RULES THEY HAVE CHANGE THUS FAR LITERALLY ONLY BENEFIT ELITE MALE ATHLETES. SO WE HEAR NOW THE CONCERN. WHICH I TOTALLY SHARE THIS CONCERN THAT ARE FEMALE ATHLETES ARE PUT AT SUCH A DISADVANTAGE. BUT IN FACT THINK ABOUT IT FOR A MOMENT. THE VERY RULE OF IN SITU WAY THAT DENIES ANY WOMAN COLLEGE STUDENT FROM MARKETING HERSELF. BASICALLY SERVES TO NOT ONLY HURT HER BUT HURT THE ENTIRE POSSIBILITY OF FEMALE ATHLETES IN FEMALE SPORTS BECOMING A BIGGER. A BIGGER FORCE WITHIN OUR ECONOMIC MARKET PLACE AND OUR CULTURE. AND YET THESE WOMEN ARE THEIR ONLY TIME OF REALLY BEING ABLE TO BE IN THE LIMELIGHT IS DURING COLLEGE BECAUSE THERE'S SO FEW PRO OPPORTUNITIES SO LET'S TAKE COURT CAITLYN OR HOW SHE FOR A MOMENT. THE UCLA GYMNAST. SHE HAS IF YOU LOOK ON YOUTUBE MILLIONS OF YOU TO VIEWERS MILLIONS NOW ANY OTHER STUDENTS COULD MARKET THEMSELVES WITH THOSE MILLIONS OF YOUTUBE YOURS. AND BE ABLE TO MONETIZE IT SHE CANNOT. WILL SHE BE ABLE TO GO PRO AFTER THE POSSIBILITY IS VERY IS LOW IT'S POSSIBLE BUT LOW. I'M YET SHE COULD UNDER THESE RULES SHE COULD HAVE POTENTIALLY MONETIZED THAT THE PHENOMENAL YOU TO VIEWERS THAT SHE GOT WE HEARD FROM ERIN CAFARO AS A ROWER SHE DIDN'T EVEN GET A SCHOLARSHIP UNTIL HER SENIOR YEAR AND ONLY A PARTIAL SCHOLARSHIP. DURING THE TIME THAT SHE WAS ROWING FOR CAL. AND BEING LOOKED AT AS A POTENTIAL OLYMPIC ATHLETE WHO SHE LATER BECAME AND WAS A GOLD MEDAL STARK. WE WE CANNOT RIGHT NOW SIT HERE AND SAY THAT THERE WAS NO ONE WHO MIGHT HAVE SPONSORED HER. HER LOCAL QANTAS CLUB OR ROTARY CLUB MIGHT HAVE BEEN WILLING TO SPONSOR HER WHEN SHE DID NOT HAVE A SCHOLARSHIP AND HELP HER COVER HER COSTS. BUT THAT IS DENIED SO. I SAY THAT THE NC TO A IN THERE MAKING THESE THREATS TO CALIFORNIA. IS PUTTING THIS CHILLING EFFECT AND COULD CAUSE SOME OF YOU FILL UP WE CAN'T CHANGE THE RULES. BUT IN FACT THIS BILL IS DESIGNED TO GIVE NC TWO WAY TO CHANGE THE RULES AND TO GIVE OUR CALIFORNIA COLLEGES. THE ABILITY TO ADVOCATE FOR OUR STUDENTS. TO ADVOCATE FOR OUR STUDENTS AND IF YOU LOOK AT THERE WAS A TWITTER STORM YESTERDAY. BECAUSE OF THE USA TO TODAY ARTICLE AND THE FIRST TIME THE NC TWO EIGHT MADE PUBLIC THEIR THREATS. AND THEN NOT TWITTER STORM AND I THINK YOU ALL HAVE A COPY. PEOPLE TO SET YOU KNOW THE NC TWO WAY IS COLLEGES THE NC TO A COULD CHANGE THESE ROLES. DE UM COMMISSION OR TASK FORCE THAT THE OF STARTED WAS LITERALLY STARTED DUE TO THE FACT THAT SB TWO OH SIX PASSED THE SENATE AND THERE'S NOW CONGRESSIONAL LEGISLATION AND OTHER STATES LOOKING AT THIS. WE HAVE THE TIME TO BRING THIS TOGETHER AND I DIDN'T MENTION IN MY OPENING. THAT I AM ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS. WHERE WE ARE WE HAVE BUILT INTO THE BILL WITH THE A CHAIR SUGGESTION WE HAVE BUILT INTO THE BILL THAT IN THE THREE YEAR PERIOD BEFORE THE BILL WOULD TAKE A FACT? THAT WE WOULD MONITOR WE CALIFORNIA WOULD MONITOR THE CHANGES THAT NC TO A MATE AND WE COULD COME BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE. AND REVISE OUR RULES AS ACCORDINGLY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH A CHAIR I HAVE A JUST A FOLLOW UP COUPLE MORE QUESTIONS -- THAT IS -- I'M SURPRISED AT HOW COME NC THE PLAY REPRESENTATIVE I DON'T KNOW IF US IN THE AUDIENCE SO WOULD NOT COME HERE TO SPEAK ON THEIR BEHALF. IS THE ANY MEMBER FROM AND SEE THE PLAY HOME IS ASIAN. COLLEGE. JUST COLLEGES OKAY THEY ARE THE AMOUNT ON TODAY'S. SACRAMENTO BEAT THAT THE PATTERN SAYS SO AND TO DOUBLE LADY COULD BAN CALIFORNIA COLLEGES TO FROM BOARD GAMES SO AND A TORN MUSCLE AWFUL PROPOSED -- ETHNIC BAY. CHAU. IF. YOU HAVE NATION THAT THEY'VE BEEN VERY RESISTANT FOR FOR FOR A LONG TIME. IF FOR THEY WILL NOT. BUT CHECK AND THE CONFRONTATION OF TO CALIFORNIA LAW. HOW WOULD YOU HANDLE THIS KIND OF THE SITUATIONS WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY IF THE BILL MOVES FORWARD? TO REVISIT THE ISSUE IN THE PERIOD OF TIME THAT T. M.. THAT WE'VE GIVEN THE NC TWO EIGHT TO BE ABLE TO DELIBERATE. BUT I I JUST WANT US TO KIND OF STEP BACK FOR A MOMENT AND THINK FOR A MINUTE. IMAGINE IF ANY OTHER. BILLION DOLLAR INDUSTRY USED COLLEGE STUDENTS AS THE SOURCE OF THEIR REVENUE. TV MOVIES ANY YET DENIED STUDENTS ANY ABILITY TO SHARE IN THAT WERE TO RECEIVE ANY TYPE OF COMPENSATION OR MONETIZE. THERE WOULD BE UNIVERSAL OUTCRY. AND YET THESE ARE THE CONDITIONS THAT AND SEE TO A HAS SET UP. AND THEY ARE A BILLION DOLLAR INDUSTRY IN FACT THE TV NETWORKS. NC TO WEIGH IN THE COLLEGES THE MEDIA OUTLETS THE SPORTS APPAREL COMPANIES THE VIDEO GAME MAKERS ALL OF THEM MONETIZE THE COLLEGE ATHLETES THE STUDENTS. AND YET THE STUDENTS CANNOT IN ANY OTHER INDUSTRY THAT WAS MONETIZING THE COLLEGE STUDENT. AND THEY DID NOT AND THEY DENIED STUDENTS YOU WOULD HAVE INCREDIBLE OUTCRY. CALIFORNIA HAS A LOT OF EXPERIENCE WITH ARMAGEDDON THREATS FROM ENTRENCHED INTERESTS FOR EXAMPLE WHEN AMAZON WHEN WE DID LEGISLATION TO STOP THEIR ANTI COMPETITIVE AN UNFAIR COLLECTION REFUSAL TO COLLECT SALES TAX. THERE WAS ALL KINDS OF CHRIST THAT WE WERE DESTROYING THE INTERNET THAT WE WERE YOU KNOW THE ARMY GRETTON THREATS. NOTHING HAD HAPPENED. AMAZON IS BIGGER THAN EVER INTERNET SALES IN OUR LARGER THAN RETAIL SALES CORPORATIONS UP AND DOWN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SAID THEY WOULD LEAVE CALIFORNIA WHEN WE PASSED THE LAW THAT REQUIRED GENDER PAY EQUITY. THEY DID NOT. THERE'S BEEN THREATS OF JOB LOSS IN ECONOMIC DOOM WHEN CALIFORNIA ADOPTED BOLD CLIMATE CHANGE LAWS AND YET WERE THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY OF THE WORLD WE HAVE THE BOLDEST CLIMATE CHANGE LAWS. WE WITHSTOOD ALL OF THOSE WITHOUT DOOMSDAY CONSEQUENCES THIS IS WHAT CALIFORNIA DOES WE LEAD AND WE LEAD WITH OUR VALUES. ALEX GRAYS THE ICY CO -- I JUST WANNA MAKE ONE OR TWO BRIEF COMMENTS IF I MAY UM. FIRST OF ALL THE BAND DECISION ON OTHER THINGS LEAD TO THE ELIMINATION OF THE MONETIZATION OF THESE ATHLETES FOR VIDEO GAMES -- STUDENT ATHLETES CAN PROFIT -- OUTSIDE ABOUT LET X. -- JOSH LAMB FROM THE FENCING TEAM AT DUKE WAS ALLOWED YOU THE SAME IMAGE LIKE THIS PROMOTE A COMPANY -- THAT HE DEVELOPED. AND AND THERE ARE ADDITIONAL -- OPPORTUNITIES IN WAIVERS FOR STUDENTS TO BENEFIT -- OUTSIDE ABOUT POLITICS -- THAT ADDITIONALLY IN REGARDS TO WHAT WE ARE THE NC TWO WAY I WOULD JUST SAY THAT WE ARE YES WE ARE MEMBERS OF THE AND TEACH YOU A AND I THINK WHATEVER. YOUR THOUGHTS ON IN SITU WAY -- YOU KNOW THE INSTITUTIONS ARE IN A I WOULD SAY SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT POSITION AT ALL THIS IN IN SITU A IS AN ORGANIZATION -- YOU KNOW WE HAVE TWENTY FOUR DIVISION ONE PROGRAMS THAT ARE -- IN CA MEMBERS IN CALIFORNIA THERE ARE I THINK THREE HUNDRED FIFTY ONE DIVISION ONE PROGRAMS NATIONALLY -- WE DO HAVE THE ABILITY TO PARTICIPATE IN THE GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE -- THROUGH -- V. CONFERENCES AND THROUGH OTHER MECHANISMS THAT SUCH AS THAT AND CALIFORNIA'S CITIZENS HAVE SUPPORTED A NUMBER OF IMPROVEMENTS THAT THE AG STAND BENEFITS THE STUDENT ATHLETES -- WE'VE SUPPORTED POLICY CHANGE THE PERMIT INSTITUTIONS TO PASTE IN ATHLETES UP TO THE FULL COST OF ATTENDANCE. THAT WAS I THINK FOR SO FOR FIVE YEARS AGO -- AS WELL AS PROVIDE A STIPEND TO COVER PERSONAL EXPENSES AND TRAVEL THE HOME. OUR INSTITUTIONS OF SUPPORT MOVING TO GUARANTEE MULTIPLE YOUR SCHOLARSHIPS TO STUDENTS AS WELL AS REPLACEMENT SCHOLARSHIPS. THEY GET INJURED AS WELL AS ENHANCE MEDICAL MENTAL HEALTH COVERAGE. WE'VE ALSO INCREASE THAT STUDENT ATHLETES PARTICIPATION IN THE GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE FOR EXAMPLE THE WEST COAST CONFERENCE WHICH SEVEN OF OUR MEMBERS -- PARTICIPATING SO IT'S LIKE THE U. OPIES SANTA CLARA AS UNIVERSITY SAN DIEGO'S -- IN LAST YEAR ADDED A STUDENT ATHLETE FROM EACH INSTITUTION IS A VOTING MEMBER -- IN THAT GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE. CURRENTLY THIS YEAR WERE SUPPORTING AB FIFTEEN EIGHTEEN WHICH IS A BILL THAT YOU'VE AUTHORED -- THAT WOULD ALLOW LEAD STUDENT ATHLETES THE OPPORTUNITY TO EXPLORE PROFESSIONAL OPPORTUNITIES -- WITHOUT JEOPARDIZING THEIR ABILITY TO COME BACK IF THEY YOU KNOW GO EXPLORE THAT REALIZE THAT THEY THEY PERHAPS -- OR NOT IS WELL POSITIONED ATTRACTED IS PERHAPS THEY IMAGINE THEY MIGHT BE -- I THINK IN JUST LASTLY WITH THE THE NC TO A WORKING GROUP YOU KNOW THEIR RECOMMENDATIONS ARE COMING OUT IN OCTOBER -- WE'VE BEEN TOLD THAT THEY ARE GOING TO BE RECOMMENDED POLICY CHANGES AROUND THESE ISSUES -- GIVEN THERE'S A DELAY TILL TWENTY TWENTY THREE IMPLEMENTATION. WE BELIEVE THAT THERE IS NOT HARM IN PUSHING THIS CONVERSATION BACK INTO EARLY NEXT YEAR TO SEE WHAT THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS ARE AND WHERE WE CAN HAVE ALIGNMENT -- BECAUSE AGAIN YOU KNOW OUR SCHOOLS. YOU KNOW IF YOUR STUDENT ATHLETE AND YOU RECEIVE COMPENSATION. I I I WOULD SAY THAT IT IS GOING TO PUT YOU IN A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE BECAUSE AGAIN AT THE PROGRAMS ARE GOING TO HAVE TO EVALUATE IF YOU HAVE ONE STUDENT ATHLETE BEING PAID IF YOU ALLOW THEM TO COMPETE. THEIR ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES FOR THE ENTIRE PROGRAM VACATE WINS YOU'RE AN ELIGIBLE FOR POSTSEASON PLAY -- YOU ALSO FACE YOU KNOW SCHOOLS ARE OF REQUIRED TO SELF REPORT VIOLATIONS -- AND IF YOU'RE REPEAT VIOLATOR IF YOU HAVE YOU KNOW STUDENT ATHLETES ACROSS MULTIPLE SPORTS READ YOU KNOW MULTIPLE OUTLETS IN ONE SPORT. WHO ARE AT COMPETING RECEIVES COMPENSATION YOU FACE THE POSSIBILITY OF LOS COLLAR SHIPS WHICH IS THAT OPPORTUNITIES FOR FUTURE STUDENT ATHLETES THAT ARE NOT NO LONGER AVAILABLE -- SO AGAIN FROM THAT UTILITARIAN PERSPECTIVE I THINK OUR SCHOOLS ARE GOING TO FEEL AS THOUGH IF THERE IS A STUDENT ATHLETE THAT THEY KNOW IS RECEIVING COMPENSATION FOR THE NAME IMAGE AND LIKENESS THAT STUDENT ATHLETES NOT TO BE ALLOWED TO COMPETE. IN ORDER TO PROTECT THE OTHER STUDENT ATHLETES THAT TEAM AND THEIR ABILITY TO LISTEN ABOUT. THANK YOU ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS. ALL RIGHT WILL DEFINITELY WILL GIVE YOU TWO MINUTES. THE THREE YEAR HOLD IF YOU WILL WITH THE BAT WHERE THE THE THE BILL WILL BE -- KINDA AND THAT OUR RECRUITING. WHAT ATHLETE WOULD WANT TO COME WE'RE NOT A MEMBER OF THE INSTITUTION [inaudible] THEY'RE NOT. JUST ONE VERY BRIEF COMMENT TO EXPAND ON THAT. IN THE RECRUITING WORLD. WE ARE RECRUITING INTO THE HIGH SCHOOL AGES SO WE ARE RECRUITING SEE ATHLETES WHO WOULD BE THE INCOMING CLASS OF TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE AND TWO COACHES COMMENTS. IF YOU WERE FORCED INTO DECISION WHERE. SCHOOL A IN CALIFORNIA -- SCHOOL BE AND ARIZONA FOR EXAMPLE AND YOU WERE TOLD. WELL. DON'T GO TO SCHOOL A IN CALIFORNIA BECAUSE YOU WILL NOT HAVE A SCHOLARSHIP WAITING FOR YOU BECAUSE THERE IS THE POTENTIAL. THE POTENTIAL THAT UNIVERSITY WOULD BE EXPELLED. AND THERE ARE ONLY A CERTAIN NUMBER OF ROSTER SPOTS ACROSS THE UNITED STATES WE'RE TALKING ABOUT 800-021-0000 STUDENT ATHLETES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ALONE. THERE ARE NOT ENOUGH UNIVERSITIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY TO TAKE ALL THE STUDENT ATHLETES. SO THERE WILL BE DIFFICULT DECISIONS MADE IN THIS INTERIM PERIOD SO THERE IS A HARMONISED SHORT RUN. WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH EARNS THANK YOU FOR THE WITNESSES FORK -- TRAVEL ALL THE WAY FROM LONG BEACH AND SAN DIEGO TO TESTIFY. AT ALL I HAD -- EXTENSIVE CON CONVERSATION WITH THE AUTHOR ON THIS BILL I'M OWN COME VERY CONFIDENCE THAT -- SENATOR SKINNER UNDERSTOOD. THE SHE UNDERSTAND THE CONCERNS AND THAT YOU SHOULD -- WAS BROUGHT UP A FULL WERE BY BY THE OPPOSITION. AND ALSO -- THANK HER FOR TAKING THE MAMMON TO KIND OF LEAVE THE CONVERSATION -- OPEN WE WILL DEFINITELY EXAM TO USE TO RELATING TO THIS ROUTE OCTOBER RULING FROM AN UNKNOWN NC DOUBLE A AND WOOD -- WILL DEFINITELY YOU WHO WILL REVERSE IT AS USUAL -- ON IMPLEMENTATION SUFFICIENT FUNDIE AND AND RECOMMENDATION SO -- ARE I WOULD BE SUPPORTING THIS -- TO THE EARTH THIS BILL I I JUST HAD A ONE QUICK QUESTION FOR THE ATTORNEY FROM A SAN DIEGO. I REMEMBER EARLY -- í INDICATED THAT THIS IS ALREADY A CALIFORNIA LAW. AND SO OUR QUESTION IS IF IT'S ALREADY A CALIFORNIA LAW NORTH CONNECT -- YOU HAVE. ZERO ONE ARE YOU OKAY. WELL WILL IT. MY MY QUESTION IS YOU IF IT'S ALREADY IN THE BOOK. WHY DO WE NEED A BAIL? OUT WHAT I MEANT TO SAY MISTER CHAIRMAN IS THAT IT IS ALREADY CALIFORNIA LAW THAT EVERY CITIZEN. OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. OF ANY AGE CAN ANY. ARE. STATUS EDGY STUDENT OR FOR WORKER HAS THE RIGHT. TO MONETIZE HIS NAME. LIKENESS AND IMAGE HI DO YOU DO. FOURTEEN YEAR OLD SOCCER PLAYERS DO AND WHAT I SAID WAS IF I DIDN'T SAY IT PROPERLY AND MISLED YOU I APOLOGIZE WHAT I SAID WAS. THE THOSE FOLKS WHO WANT TO GO TO COLLEGE HAVE TO GIVE UP THAT LEGAL RIGHT. THAT THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE AND THE CALIFORNIA COURTS. HAVE GIVEN THEM. SO CALIFORNIA GIVES THEM THE RIGHT. TO BENEFIT FROM SOCIAL MEDIA TO HAVE SHOE CONTRACTS AND HAVE ENDORSEMENTS. BUT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA TELLS THEM. YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO PLAY HERE IF YOU COME HERE YOU CAN MATRICULATE YOU CAN BE A STUDENT. YOU SIMPLY ARE NOT ELIGIBLE TO FOLLOW YOUR SUPPORT TOWARD FORCES THEM INTO A STATION THAT THEY WISH NOT TO HAVE TO MAKE. ALL RIGHTS AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SO -- I THINK WE'RE READY. TO TO CALL THE ROAD AND AGAIN THIS IS THE ADDRESS OF FIRST UP ON WILL WILL -- HOPEFULLY PHONE INCLUDING -- YOU ALL OF YOUR MANY OF YOU. INTO. A DISCUSSION AND I SEE -- OF US MEMBER THIS AREA. HAS THE COMMON. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I THOUGHT YOUR STAFF MAY HAVE SEEN ME EARLIER BUT I GUESS THEY DIDN'T -- MISTER BRADFORD IT'S NICE TO HAVE YOU BACK IN THE ASSEMBLY -- THANK YOU GOT TO MODI I LIKE PLEASE AS WELL. THE SKINNER. I'LL BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL TODAY -- BUT I GUESS THE ONLY COMMENT THAT I WANTED TO LEAVE WITH WAS THAT I JUST FIND IT TROUBLING THAT WE'RE INSTEAD OF CREATING ENVIRONMENTS WHERE. WE PROMOTE EDUCATION AND WE ALLOW STUDENTS TO HAVE THE BENEFIT OF A VERY -- OF A NURTURING ENVIRONMENT FOR EDUCATION WE'RE ALL THE MORE -- GIVING INTO THE CULTURE OF HOW WE MONETIZE EVERYTHING -- I DON'T THINK THIS BILL HURTS THAT THE CULTURE IS ALREADY THERE. I THINK WE'RE ONLY. ALLOWING FOR THERE TO BE A LITTLE BIT MORE FREEDOM THROUGH THIS BILL SO THAT MAYBE THIS TO SOME EXTENT DOESN'T BECOME AN ISSUE -- BUT I I I YOU KNOW THIS IS THIS IS. MARKET PRESSURES VERSUS CULTURE VERSES HOW DO YOU CREATE AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE YOU CAN ACTUALLY ALLOW STUDENTS TO THRIVE -- AND UNFORTUNATELY I THINK IN THE LONG RUN. ABOVE AND BEYOND EVERYTHING ELSE I THINK WE'RE LOSING. AND BUT WITH THAT I'D BE. SUPPORTING THIS BILL BECAUSE I'D WANT THERE TO AT LEAST I'M HOPING THAT. THIS BILL ALLOWS FOR THERE TO BE CERTAIN FREEDOMS OR CERTAIN PRESSURES ALLEVIATED -- AND AND SEE WHERE IT GOES IT'S IT'S KIND OF AN EXPLORATORY OPPORTUNITY. SO THANK YOU. RICHARD RESEARCHER. FOR IT I I ANSWER SKINNER -- CLOSED DOOR HER COMMENTS WORSE SHOULD SERVE AS OUR COLD BUT I JUST WOULD LIKE TO COMMENT AND I WANT TO THANK ALL THE WITNESSES BOTH. IN SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE AND IN OPPOSITION FOR YOUR INSIDE AND AND YOUR THOUGHTS ASH AS RELATES TO THIS BUT I THINK. A CEMENT MISSOURIAN HIT THE NAIL ON THE HEAD. THIS IS ALREADY OUT OF CONTROL THE HORSE IS ALREADY OUT THE BAR WHEN YOU HAVE. COLLEGE COACHES MAKE HIM AKING MORE THAN. PRESIDENTS OF UNIVERSITIES. WHEN THEY MAKE MORE THAN THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES? WHO MAKE MORE THAN HEADS OF SOME CORPORATIONS THIS IS ABOUT MONEY FOLKS? AND THIS IS NOT ABOUT THE NINE YOUNG FOLKS IN EDUCATION AND THAT THIS HOPEFULLY INCENTIVIZE EASY JUNKETS TO STAY IN COLLEGE BECAUSE WE'VE GIVEN THE EXAMPLES OF A ONE AND DONE. WHO GO TO COLLEGE JUST LONG ENOUGH TO GETTHEIR NAME OUT THERE TO BE DRAFTED AND THEY GO ON TO MAKE MONEY BECAUSE THEY KNOW THEIR SHELF LIFE AS THE ATHLETE? IS LIMITED. THIS IS ABOUT FAIRNESS FOR YOUNG LADIES AS WELL. OUR WE WANT BALLOTS WE'VE DISCUSSED IN THIS LEGISLATURE ABOUT GENDER EQUITY GENDER PAY EQUITY FOR YEARS SINCE I'VE BEEN HERE WE'VE TALKED ALL LAST WEEK DURING OUT THE WORLD CUP SOCCER GAMES. HOW APPALLED WE ALL WERE ALL THAT THESE WOMEN ATHLETES MAKE PENNIES ON THE DOLLAR COMPARED TO MEN? AND FOR MOST ELITE ATHLETES WITH THE EXCEPTION OF FOOTBALL MOST OF THEM IF YOU'RE A LEAGUE BASKETBALL PLAYER. LIKE LEBRON JAMES YOU BYPASS COLLEGE ALTOGETHER. YOU KNOW YOU ARE YOU SAY AND MOST MANY OF THESE GUYS NOW DO ONE YEAR IF YOU'RE GOOD BASEBALL PLAYER YOU'RE DRAFTED. I'M USUALLY IN YOUR SENIOR YEAR BY IT HI MAJOR LEAGUE TEAM. END OF YOUR GREAT SOCCER PLAYER. LIKE OUR FREDDIE A DO THIS KID WAS RECRUITED AND DROPPED IT FOURTEEN BY A PROFESSIONAL SOCCER TEAM SO AGAIN WE HAVE BEEN EXPLOITING THESE YOUNG FOLKS. MANY OF THEM WERE BLACK AND BROWN FOR THE MOST PART MANY COME FROM SOCIAL ECONOMIC -- DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND THIS IS ALL WE'RE SEEING IS THAT WHILE THEY HAVE A I A A WORK VALUE WE'RE NOT SEEN PAY THESE ATHLETES WERE SEEN. ALLOW THEM TO OUR CREW BE IT IN SOME TRUST FUND OR SOME AND NOBODY THAT THEY CAN SHARE AND AFTER THEIR PLANE DAYS ARE OVER THIS IS NOT ABOUT. PAIN ATHLETES IT'S AGAIN IT'S BOB BALANCING THE PLAYING FIELD. AND GIVING EVERYBODY OPPORTUNITY IN ITS INCENTIVE TO STAY IN SCHOOL. IT IS THE SENATE TO STAY IN SCHOOL BECAUSE IF IF IF IF THEY WERE ABLE TO EARN INCOME. FOR LEASE PUT SOMETHING ASIDE MANY THESE KIDS WOULD NOT BE DOING ONE AND DONES THEY WOULD NOT BE LEAVING COLLEGE AFTER JUST. ONE SEASON THEY WOULD STAY FOR ALL FOUR YEARS THEY WOULD GET THEIR COLLEGE DEGREES SO I THINK THIS IS. A CIVIL RIGHTS ISSUE OF TODAY ASH I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE.
