THAT THIS IS AGREEMENT DOUBLE

00:13:31.477 --> 00:13:34.313
DOOR- SO CERTAINLY WE HEAR IN

00:13:34.380 --> 00:13:36.048
THE LEGISLATURE HAVE HAD TO DEAL

00:13:36.115 --> 00:13:37.716

PARTIES TO AGREE TO THIS

00:13:53.566 --> 00:13:54.400
AGREEMENT. SO I THINK THAT'S

00:13:54.466 --> 00:13:57.036
VERY IMPORTANT. I ALSO WANT TO

00:13:57.102 --> 00:13:58.737
MAKE NOTE THOUGH IS THAT-

00:13:58.804 --> 00:14:01.373
CERTAINLY- IT'S IMPORTANT TO

00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:03.142
RECOGNIZE THAT FIRST OF ALL

00:14:03.209 --> 00:14:05.110
THERE WAS NEVER EVER EVEN WITH

00:14:05.177 --> 00:14:08.247
MICRON A LIMIT ON ECONOMIC

00:14:08.314 --> 00:14:11.083

00:14:11.150 --> 00:14:13.018

DISAGREEMENTS LIFTING CAPS ON

00:14:15.788 --> 00:14:17.957
NON ECONOMIC DAMAGES SO IN OTHER

00:14:18.023 --> 00:14:19.692
WORDS WE NEED TO KEEP IN MIND

00:14:19.758 --> 00:14:20.259
THAT PATIENTS WHEN THEY'RE

00:14:20.326 --> 00:14:22.328
INJURED THEY WILL ALWAYS GET

00:14:22.394 --> 00:14:23.596
FULL COMPENSATION INJURY HAD IT

00:14:23.662 --> 00:14:25.497
BEFORE WE'LL CONTINUE TO HAVE IT

00:14:25.564 --> 00:14:27.366
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT AS WELL SO

00:14:27.433 --> 00:14:29.235
THAT I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT

00:14:29.301 --> 00:14:30.436
I THINK TO REMEMBER. SECOND OF

00:14:30.502 --> 00:14:32.771
ALL YOU'LL BE HONEST AS IT IS A-

00:14:32.838 --> 00:14:34.740
AS A PHYSICIAN- THIS WILL PUT

00:14:34.807 --> 00:14:36.875
UPWARD PRESSURE- BECAUSE RAISING

00:14:36.942 --> 00:14:38.811
THE CAPS ON HEALTHCARE COSTS

00:14:38.877 --> 00:14:40.379
THIS WILL RAISE THE OVERHEAD

00:14:40.446 --> 00:14:42.514
COST LIABILITY COSTS FOR A

00:14:42.581 --> 00:14:44.950
CLINICS HOSPITALS AND PHYSICIANS

00:14:45.017 --> 00:14:47.152
BUT IT DOES DO IN A WAY THAT IS-

00:14:47.219 --> 00:14:49.288
PREDICTABLE AND MANAGEABLE IN

00:14:49.355 --> 00:14:51.724
THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT. SO

00:14:51.790 --> 00:14:53.759
THAT WILL AUSUBEL MINIMIZE THOSE

00:14:53.826 --> 00:14:55.160
COST PRESSURES AND COST

00:14:55.227 --> 00:14:56.128
INCREASES AND THAT'S WHY THIS

00:14:56.195 --> 00:14:57.730
DEALS ALSO SO VERY IMPORTANT AS

00:14:57.796 --> 00:14:59.665
WELL- THE ALTERNATIVE WOULD HAVE

00:14:59.732 --> 00:15:02.134
BEEN. MUCH HIGHER POTENTIALLY

00:15:02.201 --> 00:15:04.169
HIGHER INCREASES AND LESS

00:15:04.236 --> 00:15:05.938
PREDICTABLE ONES WHICH I COULD

00:15:06.005 --> 00:15:08.207
PUT A MAJOR PRESSURE ESPECIALLY

00:15:08.274 --> 00:15:09.275
AS WE'RE STRUGGLING WITH TRYING

00:15:09.341 --> 00:15:13.012
TO CONTROL HEALTH CARE COSTS SO

00:15:13.078 --> 00:15:14.713
THIS DEAL DOES ACHIEVE. I WELL

00:15:14.780 --> 00:15:16.148
CERTAINLY HAS CERTAIN EFFECTS IT

00:15:16.215 --> 00:15:17.483
CERTAINLY IS ONE THAT WILL LEAD

00:15:17.549 --> 00:15:19.652
TO. A BETTER SOLUTION MOVING

00:15:19.718 --> 00:15:21.920
FORWARD. AND AGAIN WANT TO THANK

THREATENED. AND THERE OF COURSE

00:16:14.773 --> 00:16:17.343
HAS BEEN A DEBATE ABOUT. WHETHER

00:16:17.409 --> 00:16:18.510
THAT WAS A MANIPULATION OF THE

00:16:18.577 --> 00:16:20.546

OF THAT TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY

00:16:44.536 --> 00:16:46.372
THOUSAND IS NOW. IT IS ROUGHLY

00:16:46.438 --> 00:16:47.806
FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS AND SO

00:16:47.873 --> 00:16:50.242
WHILE THERE'S NO LIMIT ON THE

00:16:50.309 --> 00:16:52.311
ECONOMIC DAMAGES THE WOMEN ON

00:16:52.378 --> 00:16:54.480
THIS PART WAS KEEPING PEOPLE

00:16:54.546 --> 00:16:56.715
FROM GETTING REPRESENTATION THAT

00:16:56.782 --> 00:16:58.917
WAS THE REAL ISSUE THAT HAPPENED

00:16:58.984 --> 00:17:02.020
HERE. AND FOR THOSE OF US

00:17:02.087 --> 00:17:03.589
SITTING ON THIS FLOOR. WE HAD

00:17:03.655 --> 00:17:06.291
THE ISSUES OF- WHEN I WAS IN A

00:17:06.358 --> 00:17:07.993
LEGISLATIVE RACE IN TWENTY TEN.

00:17:08.060 --> 00:17:09.795
JUST THE FACT THAT I SAID THIS

00:17:09.862 --> 00:17:12.097
SHOULD BE INDEXED AS A CAP LED

00:17:12.164 --> 00:17:13.432
TO A MAJOR INDEPENDENT

00:17:13.499 --> 00:17:14.900
EXPENDITURE AGAINST ME IN THAT

00:17:14.967 --> 00:17:17.202
RACE. WHEN I WAS RUNNING A YEAR

00:17:17.269 --> 00:17:19.805
AND A HALF AGO I BASICALLY SAID.

00:17:19.872 --> 00:17:21.540
WE SHOULD MOVE ON THIS UNLESS

00:17:21.607 --> 00:17:23.609
EVERYONE'S IN THE TABLE AND THAT

00:17:23.675 --> 00:17:26.779
IS WHAT JUST HAPPENED. AND SO IN

00:17:26.845 --> 00:17:29.081
SALUTING EVERYBODY FOR THIS I

00:17:29.148 --> 00:17:30.749
THINK THE INTERESTING THING IS.

00:17:30.816 --> 00:17:32.518
IS THIS WAS KEPT A SECRET AS

00:17:32.584 --> 00:17:33.952
LONG AS IT WAS THIS IS

00:17:34.019 --> 00:17:36.688
SACRAMENTO AMAZINGLY IT DIDN'T

00:17:36.755 --> 00:17:37.890
FLOAT OUT THERE THAT THESE

00:17:37.956 --> 00:17:40.826
NEGOTIATIONS WERE GOING ON FOR A

00:17:40.893 --> 00:17:42.394
LONG TIME. AND THAT IS

00:17:42.461 --> 00:17:44.363
SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE I THINK IF

00:17:44.430 --> 00:17:45.531
IT HAD. IT WOULD HAVE BEEN HARD

00:17:45.597 --> 00:17:47.566
FOR SOME OF THE PLAYERS. TO HOLD

00:17:47.633 --> 00:17:49.935
THEIR PEOPLE IN LINE. AND IT

00:17:50.002 --> 00:17:51.270
GAVE THEM A CHANCE ONCE A DEAL

00:17:51.336 --> 00:17:52.838
WAS REACHED TO CONVINCE THEM

00:17:52.905 --> 00:17:54.773
THAT THIS WAS IN THEIR LONG TERM

00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:57.876
INTEREST. AND WHEN WE WERE IN

00:17:57.943 --> 00:17:59.244
THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE. OUR

00:17:59.311 --> 00:18:01.146
HEART WAS ALL PREPARED TO SPEAK

00:18:01.213 --> 00:18:03.182
TO OPPONENTS AND I THOUGHT THERE

00:18:03.248 --> 00:18:04.283
WOULD BE RANDOM OPPONENTS THAT

00:18:04.349 --> 00:18:05.884
FOR DIFFERENT REASONS BECAUSE OF

00:18:05.951 --> 00:18:07.319
THEIR OWN INTERESTS THOUGHT THAT

00:18:07.386 --> 00:18:08.887
THEY COULDN'T SUPPORTERS. BUT

00:18:08.954 --> 00:18:10.756
WHEN THE CHAIR CALLED FOR

00:18:10.823 --> 00:18:12.458
WITNESSES THERE WAS NOBODY IN

00:18:12.524 --> 00:18:13.125
THE ROOM AND THERE WAS NOBODY ON

00:18:13.192 --> 00:18:15.661
THE PHONE LINE. THAT IS

00:18:15.727 --> 00:18:17.062
MONUMENTAL BUT SOMETHING THAT IS

00:18:17.129 --> 00:18:19.832
THIS BIG DOES NOT HAVE ANY REAL

00:18:19.898 --> 00:18:21.667
OPPOSITION. AND THEN I

00:18:21.733 --> 00:18:23.969
APPRECIATE- OF THE PREVIOUS

00:18:24.036 --> 00:18:26.538
SPEAKERS NAMING WHO WAS INVOLVED

00:18:26.605 --> 00:18:28.006
IN THIS BECAUSE I THINK. FOR THE

00:18:28.073 --> 00:18:29.608
CONSUMER ATTORNEYS AND FOR THE

00:18:29.675 --> 00:18:31.643
CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION

00:18:31.710 --> 00:18:33.479
IN PARTICULAR HELLO. A

PROTECTION. WERE ALSO

00:18:37.916 --> 00:18:39.852
SIGNIFICANTALONG WITH EVERYONE

00:18:39.918 --> 00:18:42.688
AND THE DOCTORS COMPANY-

00:18:42.754 --> 00:18:44.590
CONSUMER WATCH HANDS OF THE

00:18:44.656 --> 00:18:47.559
PROPONENT OF THE BALLOT MEASURE

00:18:47.626 --> 00:18:48.961
WELL I THINK. AS MUCH AS WE LIKE

00:18:49.027 --> 00:18:51.296
TO THINK THAT ABOUT MEASURE

00:18:51.363 --> 00:18:53.098
DOESN'T FORCE A SOLUTION IT

00:18:53.165 --> 00:18:55.200
REALLY HELPED. AND THE REFORM

00:18:55.267 --> 00:18:57.269
THAT THE LEGISLATURE MADE. TO

00:18:57.336 --> 00:18:59.238
REALLY ALLOW FOR SOMEBODY TO

00:18:59.304 --> 00:19:01.373
PULL BACK AN INITIATIVE. REALLY

00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:03.242
WAS INSTRUMENTAL IN MAKING THIS

00:19:03.308 --> 00:19:07.145
HAPPEN IF THAT WASN'T THERE- SO

00:19:07.212 --> 00:19:09.314
THAT RIGHT NOW IN THIS ACROSS

00:19:09.381 --> 00:19:11.650
THE BOARD AGREEMENT. WE HAVE THE

00:19:11.717 --> 00:19:13.619
ABILITY TO PULL IT OFF THE

00:19:13.685 --> 00:19:15.454
BALLOT FOR LEAST DOWNPLAY IT IN

00:19:15.521 --> 00:19:18.690
A WAY THAT'S VERY SIGNIFICANT SO

00:19:18.757 --> 00:19:22.027
THIS IS A BIG AND I THINK THAT.

00:19:22.094 --> 00:19:24.363
THE TERROR ATTACKS FREQUENTLY

00:19:24.429 --> 00:19:26.164
THAT THE LEGISLATURE OR STATE

00:19:26.231 --> 00:19:28.333
GOVERNMENT DOESN'T WORK THIS IS

00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:30.602
REALLY AN INSTANCE WHERE TRULY

00:19:30.669 --> 00:19:32.371
WORKS WERE WERE HAVING A LONG

00:19:32.437 --> 00:19:35.274
TERM SOLUTION. THAT'S OF BENEFIT

00:19:35.340 --> 00:19:37.209
TO ALL THE PARTIES THAT IS GOING

00:19:37.276 --> 00:19:38.810
TO REMOVE ONE OF THE MOST

00:19:38.877 --> 00:19:40.512
CONTENTIOUS ISSUES. IN STATE

00:19:40.579 --> 00:19:42.781
GOVERNMENT FROM THE TABLE SO I

00:19:42.848 --> 00:19:44.883
SALUTE EVERYBODY THAT WORKED ON

00:19:44.950 --> 00:19:46.985

AND- THE SENATE I HAS COME AT

00:19:58.564 --> 00:20:00.799
THIS FROM KIND OF A UNIQUE

00:20:00.866 --> 00:20:04.736
PERSPECTIVE. I SPENT MY CAREER

00:20:04.803 --> 00:20:08.407
DEFENDING MICRO. HAVING BEEN

00:20:08.473 --> 00:20:11.543
ALMOST KILLED BY THE THERE ONE

00:20:11.610 --> 00:20:16.982
TIME. BUT WHAT MY WIFE AND I HAD

00:20:17.049 --> 00:20:19.918
NO INTENTION OF FILING A LAWSUIT

00:20:19.985 --> 00:20:21.920
. I WAS VERY VESTED IN THE

00:20:21.987 --> 00:20:23.422
HEALTH CARE INSTITUTION MY

00:20:23.488 --> 00:20:26.925
COMMUNITY. AND THE BILL PROBLEMS

00:20:26.992 --> 00:20:29.895
I BECAME A VICTIM. BUT WE WANT

00:20:29.962 --> 00:20:32.197
TO WORK TO IMPROVE THE WHOLE

00:20:32.264 --> 00:20:34.967
SYSTEM FOR EVERYBODY. RATHER

00:20:35.033 --> 00:20:37.269
THAN THE NONSENSE WELL I'M USING

00:20:37.336 --> 00:20:41.740
THE WRONG WORD BUT- A LAWSUIT.

00:20:41.807 --> 00:20:43.175
THEN I FEEL JUST A TINY BIT

00:20:43.241 --> 00:20:46.812
BETRAYED BY THIS COMPROMISE WHY

00:20:46.878 --> 00:20:48.947
. BECAUSE I PROBABLY LONGER THAN

00:20:49.014 --> 00:20:52.250
ANYBODY HAVE DEFENDED MICRO. I

00:20:52.317 --> 00:20:55.020
UNDERSTAND THE CIRCUMSTANCES

00:20:55.087 --> 00:20:57.089
THAT HAS FOSTERED THIS

00:20:57.155 --> 00:21:00.359
COMPROMISE. AND IT PROBABLY HAS

00:21:00.425 --> 00:21:02.194
MERIT WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE

00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:05.130
INDEXING OF 2% A YEAR. I DON'T

00:21:05.197 --> 00:21:07.866
LIKE INDUCTION. IT'S VERY

00:21:07.933 --> 00:21:10.869
PROBLEMATIC. AND THAT'S

00:21:10.936 --> 00:21:14.573
AUTOMATIC AS WELL. BUT I WOULD

00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:16.708
SAY WE SHOULD BE CAUTIOUS AND I

00:21:16.775 --> 00:21:19.745
MAY BE A PROBLEM THE ONLY ONE SO

00:21:19.811 --> 00:21:22.914
VOICES MY OPINION ON THIS. BUT

00:21:22.981 --> 00:21:24.916
MICRO HAS SERVED US WELL OVER

00:21:24.983 --> 00:21:28.754
THE DECADES MAYBE IT IS INDEED A

00:21:28.820 --> 00:21:31.790
NEW TIME. AND I PROBABLY SHOULD

00:21:31.857 --> 00:21:34.192
BE ONE OF THE MOST ENTHUSIASTIC

00:21:34.259 --> 00:21:36.395
SUPPORTERS. BUT TODAY I WILL BE

00:21:36.461 --> 00:21:41.900

PROUD CO AUTHOR BABY THIRTY FIVE

00:21:51.043 --> 00:21:53.211
. I FIRST BECAME INTERESTED IN

00:21:53.278 --> 00:21:55.313
IN THIS AREA BECAUSE OF SOME

00:21:55.380 --> 00:21:57.649
CONSTITUENTS- MY FIRST YEAR IN

00:21:57.716 --> 00:21:59.351
OFFICE THAT BROUGHT TO MY

00:21:59.418 --> 00:22:02.454
ATTENTION THAT. THERE WASN'T AND

00:22:02.521 --> 00:22:04.122
WE'VE KNOWN THIS TO BE TRUE IN

00:22:04.189 --> 00:22:05.490
THE CENTRAL VALLEY QUALITY CARE

00:22:05.557 --> 00:22:09.294
. AND WHEN I GOT MORE INVOLVED

00:22:09.361 --> 00:22:11.663
AND LEARN MORE ABOUT THE STORIES

00:22:11.730 --> 00:22:14.666
I LEARNED THAT. THERE IS A LOT

00:22:14.733 --> 00:22:16.134
OF ISSUES THAT WE NEEDED TO DO

00:22:16.201 --> 00:22:18.870
TO FIX. AND JUST REALLY

00:22:18.937 --> 00:22:22.507
UNFORTUNATE UP. STORIES THAT

00:22:22.574 --> 00:22:24.810
INDIVIDUALS YOUNG WOMAN COULD

00:22:24.876 --> 00:22:28.280
STILL BE ALIVE TODAY HAD WE IN

00:22:28.346 --> 00:22:30.982
PLACE A. B. A SYSTEM OF HEALTH

00:22:31.049 --> 00:22:32.217
CARE IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY

00:22:32.284 --> 00:22:33.985
IMPROBABLY PERHAPS THROUGHOUT

00:22:34.052 --> 00:22:36.121
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THAT

00:22:36.188 --> 00:22:39.825
PROVIDES QUALITY CARE- INCLUDING

00:22:39.891 --> 00:22:43.862
AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES.

00:22:43.929 --> 00:22:45.831
AND FOR THIS REASON I BEEN VERY

00:22:45.897 --> 00:22:47.899
MUCH IN FAVOR OF CREATING

00:22:47.966 --> 00:22:51.703
CHANGES SO THAT. WE PREVENT HARM

00:22:51.770 --> 00:22:53.271
IN THE FIRST PLACE THAT WE

00:22:53.338 --> 00:22:55.340
PREVENT MISTAKE IN THE FIRST

00:22:55.407 --> 00:22:57.509
PLACE BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE

00:22:57.576 --> 00:22:58.510
DAY IT'S ABOUT. GETTING QUALITY

00:22:58.577 --> 00:23:01.179

WE NEED I MEAN IT BENEFITS

00:23:07.152 --> 00:23:09.421

00:23:09.488 --> 00:23:11.289
BILL IF SOMEONE IS INJURED OR

00:23:11.356 --> 00:23:13.358

BE ENTITLED TO A REASONABLE

00:23:16.628 --> 00:23:18.263
COMPENSATION. EVEN THOUGH THERE

00:23:18.330 --> 00:23:19.898
IS NO AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT CAN

00:23:19.965 --> 00:23:21.299
