01:18:34.976 --> 01:18:36.878
DEPARTMENTS ONLINE -- WILL NOT

01:18:36.945 --> 01:18:38.180
BE CAPTURED IN THE TOTAL PROJECT

01:18:38.246 --> 01:18:39.648
COST CURRENTLY.

01:18:39.714 --> 01:18:40.382
WE'RE ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT

01:18:40.449 --> 01:18:41.716
ADDITIONAL COSTS FOR DEPARTMENTS

01:18:41.783 --> 01:18:43.085
THAT ARE ALREADY TRANSACTING

01:18:43.151 --> 01:18:45.253
FISCALE -- RELATED TO ADDITIONAL

01:18:45.320 --> 01:18:46.988
RESOURCES ARE FUNDING THAT ARE

01:18:47.055 --> 01:18:49.291
BEING REQUESTED THROUGH THE TWO

01:18:49.357 --> 01:18:50.258
THOUSAND NINETEEN TWENTY BUDGET --

01:18:50.325 --> 01:18:51.793
WERE AWARE OF SIX BCP'S WHERE

01:18:51.860 --> 01:18:53.328
THAT IS OCCURRING.

01:18:53.395 --> 01:18:54.463
AND WE REMAIN CONCERNED ABOUT

01:18:54.529 --> 01:18:55.831
DEPARTMENTS FACING CHALLENGES

01:18:55.897 --> 01:18:57.032
CLOSING THEIR MONTH END AND YEAR

01:18:57.099 --> 01:18:59.067
END FINANCIAL STATEMENTS --

01:18:59.134 --> 01:18:59.668
LOOKING IN NUMBERS YEAR OVER

01:18:59.734 --> 01:19:02.671
YEAR -- THERE ARE CONCERNS

01:19:02.737 --> 01:19:04.573
AROUND YOU KNOW THE THE THE

01:19:04.639 --> 01:19:05.941
PERCENTAGE THAT ARE ABLE TO

01:19:06.007 --> 01:19:08.777
CLOSE AT LEAST THE FIRST MONTH --

01:19:08.844 --> 01:19:11.113
OF THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN

01:19:11.179 --> 01:19:11.947
NINETEEN FISCAL YEAR.

01:19:12.013 --> 01:19:13.215
AND SO TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE

01:19:13.281 --> 01:19:14.749
ARE CONTINUE DELAYS AND AND

01:19:14.816 --> 01:19:15.951
AGAIN THERE ARE A NUMBER OF

01:19:16.017 --> 01:19:16.952
DEPARTMENTS THAT ARE QUITE A BIT

01:19:17.018 --> 01:19:18.954
LARGER IN THIS LATEST RELEASE --

01:19:19.020 --> 01:19:20.455
THAT COULD AFFECT THE TIMELINESS

01:19:20.522 --> 01:19:21.890
OR QUALITY OF THE STATE'S ANNUAL

01:19:21.957 --> 01:19:23.792
FINANCIAL REPORT -- WE ARE AWARE

01:19:23.859 --> 01:19:24.826
THAT THERE ARE CHANGES FOURTH

01:19:24.893 --> 01:19:26.228
COMING IN THE PROJECT BASS LINE

01:19:26.294 --> 01:19:28.230
AND WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR

01:19:28.296 --> 01:19:31.466
THAT PROCESS GOING FORWARD.

01:19:31.533 --> 01:19:32.567
SO I'VE BEEN PRETTY QUIET IN

01:19:32.634 --> 01:19:33.802
THIS COMMITTEE MEETING BUT I AM

01:19:33.869 --> 01:19:36.271
GONNA PIPE UP AT THIS POINT --

01:19:36.338 --> 01:19:37.639
AND I KNOW I CAN TELL FROM THE

01:19:37.706 --> 01:19:39.941
PANEL THAT -- IS NOT OF YOUR

01:19:40.008 --> 01:19:41.443
PARTICULAR EXCITED TO BE HERE ON

01:19:41.510 --> 01:19:44.212
THIS TOPIC. FOR MEMBERS THE

01:19:44.279 --> 01:19:46.414
PUBLIC IF I CAN I THINK THIS

01:19:46.481 --> 01:19:49.084
PROJECT WAS DESCRIBED JUST A FEW

01:19:49.151 --> 01:19:50.619
MINUTES GOES A DYNAMIC PRODUCT.

01:19:50.685 --> 01:19:51.753
PROJECT AND I THINK IT

01:19:51.820 --> 01:19:53.155
REPRESENTS ONE OF THE BIGGEST

01:19:53.221 --> 01:19:54.589
FAILURES.

01:19:54.656 --> 01:19:55.790
IN STATE GOVERNMENT IT'S AN

01:19:55.857 --> 01:19:57.492
EMBARRASSMENT TO STATE

01:19:57.559 --> 01:19:58.927
GOVERNMENT IT'S BEEN A DISASTER.

01:19:58.994 --> 01:20:00.962
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A PROJECT

01:20:01.029 --> 01:20:03.632
THAT STARTED IN TWO THOUSAND

01:20:03.698 --> 01:20:04.866
FIVE IT IS NOW.

01:20:04.933 --> 01:20:05.700
200-014- A PROJECT THAT HAS HAD

01:20:05.767 --> 01:20:07.202
HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS

01:20:07.269 --> 01:20:10.505
OF OVER ON LATEST TAB IS NINE

01:20:10.572 --> 01:20:11.806
HUNDRED EIGHTEEN MILLION DOLLARS.

01:20:11.873 --> 01:20:13.708
AND NOW WHAT WE'RE HEARING THIS

01:20:13.775 --> 01:20:16.578
AT THEIR CONTINUED DELAYS -- I'D

01:20:16.645 --> 01:20:17.312
LIKE TO SECTION THE

01:20:17.379 --> 01:20:18.113
REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE

01:20:18.180 --> 01:20:19.281
COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE IF YOU

01:20:19.347 --> 01:20:21.650
COULD ARTICULATE.

01:20:21.716 --> 01:20:23.218
I'VE UNDERSTAND THERE'S A LETTER

01:20:23.285 --> 01:20:24.586
SENT THE LEGISLATURE I DON'T

01:20:24.653 --> 01:20:26.755
HAVE IN FRONT OF ME THAT.

01:20:26.821 --> 01:20:28.423
HAS ADDITIONAL CONCERNS THAT

01:20:28.490 --> 01:20:30.192
THIS SYSTEM COULD CAUSE DELAYS

01:20:30.258 --> 01:20:32.294
IN THE REPORTING OF ACTOR FISCAL

01:20:32.360 --> 01:20:34.029
STATEMENTS FOR THE STATE'S

01:20:34.095 --> 01:20:35.063
KAFFIR.

01:20:35.130 --> 01:20:36.464
WHICH COULD I UNDERSTAND

01:20:36.531 --> 01:20:37.999
POTENTIALLY IMPACT OUR STATE'S

01:20:38.066 --> 01:20:39.000
CREDIT RATING.

01:20:39.067 --> 01:20:41.603
COULD YOU ELABORATE ON THAT AND

01:20:41.670 --> 01:20:43.305
I'D LIKE TO HEAR A RESPONSE FROM

01:20:43.371 --> 01:20:48.944
THE PROJECT.

01:20:49.010 --> 01:20:50.045
THERE COULD BE A VARIETY OF

01:20:50.111 --> 01:20:51.479
REASONS WHY THE STATE'S KAFFIR

01:20:51.546 --> 01:20:52.881
COULD BE DELAYED -- THEY COULD

01:20:52.948 --> 01:20:54.216
BE SYSTEM ISSUES THE COULD BE

01:20:54.282 --> 01:20:55.584
WORKLOAD ISSUES WHEN YOU SAY

01:20:55.650 --> 01:20:57.185
COULD BE SIR I'M SORRY WHAT

01:20:57.252 --> 01:20:58.687
WHAT'S THE ANSWER.

01:20:58.753 --> 01:21:00.822
YOU JUST DON'T ACTUALLY EVEN

01:21:00.889 --> 01:21:02.757
KNOW WHAT THE ANSWER IS.

01:21:02.824 --> 01:21:04.326
WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY ASSEMBLY

01:21:04.392 --> 01:21:06.761
MEMBER IS THAT THE KAFIR CAN BE

01:21:06.828 --> 01:21:08.964
DELAYED AND OR HAVE ISSUES FOR A

01:21:09.030 --> 01:21:10.799
VARIETY OF REASONS?

01:21:10.865 --> 01:21:12.133
OUR AND STATE AUDITOR CAN

01:21:12.200 --> 01:21:13.101
PROBABLY EXPLAIN WHAT THOSE

01:21:13.168 --> 01:21:13.902
REASONS ARE.

01:21:13.969 --> 01:21:17.138
THE THE CAPPER WHICH IS THE

01:21:17.205 --> 01:21:18.373
STATE'S AUDITED FINANCIAL

01:21:18.440 --> 01:21:20.041
STATEMENTS CAN BE DELAYED

01:21:20.108 --> 01:21:21.476
BECAUSE OF COMPLEXITY IS HAVING

01:21:21.543 --> 01:21:22.510
TO WHAT WHAT WHAT WE HAVE TO DO

01:21:22.577 --> 01:21:23.712
THAT PARTICULAR HERE.

01:21:23.778 --> 01:21:24.846
IT COULD BE DELAYED BECAUSE OF

01:21:24.913 --> 01:21:26.348
THE WORKLOAD ISSUES WHETHER IT'S

01:21:26.414 --> 01:21:29.117
FISCALE -- WORKLOAD ISSUES.

01:21:29.184 --> 01:21:30.885
OR OTHER ISSUES WITH IN OTHER

01:21:30.952 --> 01:21:32.320
SYSTEM SO THERE'S A THE CARD THE

01:21:32.387 --> 01:21:33.755
CAPPER IS A COMPLEX ANIMAL THE

01:21:33.822 --> 01:21:35.724
KAFFIR PROJECT PLAN EVERY YEAR

01:21:35.790 --> 01:21:37.259
HAS OVER NINE HUNDRED

01:21:37.325 --> 01:21:39.060
DELIVERABLES. FOR US TO BE ABLE

01:21:39.127 --> 01:21:39.928
TO COMPLETE IT.

01:21:39.995 --> 01:21:41.263
AND HAVE THE STATE AUDITOR ISSUE

01:21:41.329 --> 01:21:42.163
AN OPINION.

01:21:42.230 --> 01:21:43.632
SO THERE ARE A VARIETY OF ISSUES

01:21:43.698 --> 01:21:44.799
AND EVERY YEAR IT'S SOMETHING

01:21:44.866 --> 01:21:45.567
DIFFERENT IT'S NEVER THE SAME

01:21:45.634 --> 01:21:47.135
THING TWICE THE CONTROLLERS

01:21:47.202 --> 01:21:49.271
CONCERN THIS YEAR WAS SOME OF

01:21:49.337 --> 01:21:49.904
THE ISSUES WE WERE HAVING WITH

01:21:49.971 --> 01:21:50.772
THIS GAL.

01:21:50.839 --> 01:21:54.009
AND NOT NECESSARILY -- TECHNICAL

01:21:54.075 --> 01:21:55.710
ISSUES BUT WORKLOAD ISSUES THAT

01:21:55.777 --> 01:21:56.645
WE WERE HAVING WITH THIS GAL MAY

01:21:56.711 --> 01:21:59.281
CAUSE A DELAY IN THIS YEAR'S AND

01:21:59.347 --> 01:22:00.582
OR NEXT YEAR'S KAFFIR.

01:22:00.649 --> 01:22:01.650
AND ALSO AS THE LA -- MENTION

01:22:01.716 --> 01:22:02.751
BECAUSE SOME OF THE DEPARTMENTS

01:22:02.817 --> 01:22:04.386
ARE HAVING TROUBLE CLOSING THEIR

01:22:04.452 --> 01:22:05.387
BOOKS AND PROVIDING THE

01:22:05.453 --> 01:22:06.888
FINANCIAL INFORMATION THAT IS

01:22:06.955 --> 01:22:08.089
WHAT THE CONTROLLERS CONCERNED

01:22:08.156 --> 01:22:09.591
ABOUT AND HER LETTER WAS.

01:22:09.658 --> 01:22:12.494
PRIMARILY DESIGNED OR INTENDED

01:22:12.560 --> 01:22:14.162
TO JUST GET THAT WORD OUT THERE

01:22:14.229 --> 01:22:15.530
THAT SHE HAS THAT CONCERN THAT

01:22:15.597 --> 01:22:17.565
WE FOCUS ON THE ENHANCEMENTS TO

01:22:17.632 --> 01:22:18.800
THE SYSTEM THAT WILL HELP

01:22:18.867 --> 01:22:20.001
WORKLOAD ISSUES.

01:22:20.068 --> 01:22:21.236
BOTH AT THE DEPARTMENT LEVEL AND

01:22:21.303 --> 01:22:23.538
SCO LEVEL IN ORDER TO GET THINGS

01:22:23.605 --> 01:22:25.073
RESOLVED AND GET THE KAFFIR AND

01:22:25.140 --> 01:22:26.841
OF THE OTHER FINANCIAL --

01:22:26.908 --> 01:22:28.176
PRODUCTS THAT WE NEED TO PUT OUT.

01:22:28.243 --> 01:22:29.744
ON TIME THAT'S WHAT THE LETTER

01:22:29.811 --> 01:22:31.112
WAS INTENDED TO DO THE

01:22:31.179 --> 01:22:32.514
CONTROLLER HAS FULL SUPPORT IS

01:22:32.580 --> 01:22:34.049
FULLY SUPPORTIVE OF THE PROJECT

01:22:34.115 --> 01:22:35.684
HAS FULL CONFIDENCE IN THE

01:22:35.750 --> 01:22:37.452
PROJECT WILL SUCCEED -- THE

01:22:37.519 --> 01:22:38.887
PROJECT WILL PROVIDE

01:22:38.953 --> 01:22:40.622
EFFICIENCIES BUT IT'S A BELL

01:22:40.689 --> 01:22:42.023
SHAPED CURVE RIGHT IT'S GOES UP

01:22:42.090 --> 01:22:43.425
IT UP HERE FOR AWHILE THEN IT

01:22:43.491 --> 01:22:44.025
WILL EVENTUALLY WILL GO BACK

01:22:44.092 --> 01:22:44.626
DOWN.

01:22:44.693 --> 01:22:47.028
BUT IT HAS TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE

01:22:47.095 --> 01:22:48.897
THE TOOLS THAT WE NEED NOT ONLY

01:22:48.963 --> 01:22:50.398
FOR THE DEPARTMENTS BUT ALSO FOR

01:22:50.465 --> 01:22:54.369
THE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE --

01:22:54.436 --> 01:22:56.104
CONTROL FUNCTIONALITY TO WORK.

01:22:56.171 --> 01:22:57.972
IF I COULD ASK FOR RESPONSE FROM

01:22:58.039 --> 01:22:59.708
THE PROJECT LET ME SAY I I A I

01:22:59.774 --> 01:23:00.275
HAVE A LOT OF FAITH IN OUR

01:23:00.342 --> 01:23:03.578
CONTROL -- AND I A BELIEVER

01:23:03.645 --> 01:23:05.914
ASSESSMENT THAT -- THERE ARE

01:23:05.980 --> 01:23:08.116
CONTINUE NEEDS. FOR NEEDS FOR

01:23:08.183 --> 01:23:10.118
DELAY BUT GIVEN THE HISTORY OF

01:23:10.185 --> 01:23:12.020
THIS PROJECT GIVEN THE FACT THAT

01:23:12.087 --> 01:23:13.855
SOMEONE BORN IN.

01:23:13.922 --> 01:23:14.456
TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN WHO'S NOW

01:23:14.522 --> 01:23:16.024
IN HIGH SCHOOL WOULD EXPERIENCE

01:23:16.091 --> 01:23:16.925
AN AWFUL LOT OF DIFFERENT TYPES

01:23:16.991 --> 01:23:18.727
OF TECHNOLOGIES OVER THE PAST

01:23:18.793 --> 01:23:19.961
FOURTEEN YEARS.

01:23:20.028 --> 01:23:21.596
MANY OF US HAVE JUST NO FAITH

01:23:21.663 --> 01:23:23.698
THAT THIS PROGRAM IS EVER GOING

01:23:23.765 --> 01:23:26.468
TO COME TO COMPLETION SO -- TELL

01:23:26.534 --> 01:23:27.936
US WHY WE SHOULD HAVE SOME FAITH.

01:23:28.002 --> 01:23:29.537
SO THE PROJECT STARTED IN TWO

01:23:29.604 --> 01:23:30.805
THOUSAND AND FIVE AS JUST THE

01:23:30.872 --> 01:23:32.374
BUDGETARY REPLACEMENT SYSTEMS

01:23:32.440 --> 01:23:34.175
THAT WAS OUR FIRST INTRODUCTION

01:23:34.242 --> 01:23:35.210
TO THIS PROJECT.

01:23:35.276 --> 01:23:36.411
AND THAT COST ESTIMATE WAS AT A

01:23:36.478 --> 01:23:37.245
HUNDRED AND FORTY MILLION

01:23:37.312 --> 01:23:38.880
DOLLARS JUST TO REPLACE THE FOUR

01:23:38.947 --> 01:23:39.881
MAIN FRAMES.

01:23:39.948 --> 01:23:42.016
AT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE.

01:23:42.083 --> 01:23:43.885
BY TWO THOUSAND AND SEVEN IT WAS

01:23:43.952 --> 01:23:45.053
EVIDENT THAT THERE WERE A NUMBER

01:23:45.120 --> 01:23:47.822
OF OTHER SYSTEMS STATEWIDE THAT

01:23:47.889 --> 01:23:49.190
NEEDED TO BE REPLACED.

01:23:49.257 --> 01:23:50.759
SO IN TWO THOUSAND AND SEVEN THE

01:23:50.825 --> 01:23:52.060
STATE COMPTROLLER THE STATE

01:23:52.127 --> 01:23:53.595
TREASURER'S OFFICE THE

01:23:53.661 --> 01:23:54.629
DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL SERVICES

01:23:54.696 --> 01:23:56.231
PROCUREMENT DIVISION.

01:23:56.297 --> 01:23:58.199
AS WELL AS THE GOVERNOR'S -- THE

01:23:58.266 --> 01:23:59.901
ORIGINAL SCOPE OF THE BUDGET

01:23:59.968 --> 01:24:01.369
BEING SYSTEM REPLACEMENT WERE

01:24:01.436 --> 01:24:02.937
COMBINED INTO WHAT IS THE

01:24:03.004 --> 01:24:04.773
FINANCIAL INFORMATION SYSTEM FOR

01:24:04.839 --> 01:24:06.007
CALIFORNIA FISCAL.

01:24:06.074 --> 01:24:08.243
THAT ESTIMATED THAT TIMES OF THE

01:24:08.309 --> 01:24:11.112
SCOPE SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGED AND

01:24:11.179 --> 01:24:13.047
THAT INITIAL -- ESTIMATE WAS AT

01:24:13.114 --> 01:24:15.283
ONE POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS.

01:24:15.350 --> 01:24:17.685
OVER THE COURSE OF THE NEXT FEW

01:24:17.752 --> 01:24:19.254
YEARS AS WE HAVE BEEN

01:24:19.320 --> 01:24:20.955
IMPLEMENTING THIS PROJECT BOTH

01:24:21.022 --> 01:24:22.824
THE SCOPE AS WELL AS THE

01:24:22.891 --> 01:24:24.426
SCHEDULE HAS SHIFTED.

01:24:24.492 --> 01:24:26.161
BASED ON THE NEEDS ARE THE

01:24:26.227 --> 01:24:27.862
CURRENT NEEDS OF THE DEPARTMENTS

01:24:27.929 --> 01:24:29.330
AND WHERE THE CONTROL AGENCIES

01:24:29.397 --> 01:24:31.599
AS WELL AS IN ONE CASE WE

01:24:31.666 --> 01:24:33.334
CHANGED SIGNIFICANTLY.

01:24:33.401 --> 01:24:35.670
THE WAY WE ON BOARD DEPARTMENTS

01:24:35.737 --> 01:24:37.539
WE WENT FROM THE IDEA IT WHEN WE

01:24:37.605 --> 01:24:38.873
WERE ONE POINT SIX BILLION

01:24:38.940 --> 01:24:39.908
DOLLARS TO HAVE.

01:24:39.974 --> 01:24:41.075
PEOPLE IN EVERY SINGLE

01:24:41.142 --> 01:24:42.510
DEPARTMENTS TO HELP WITH THIS

01:24:42.577 --> 01:24:44.345
TRANSITION TO A TRAIN THE

01:24:44.412 --> 01:24:45.980
TRAINER MODEL WHICH IS WHAT WE

01:24:46.047 --> 01:24:47.182
ULTIMATELY IMPLEMENTED.

01:24:47.248 --> 01:24:49.984
THAT IN SOME PART WAS DUE TO THE

01:24:50.051 --> 01:24:51.820
FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE STATE

01:24:51.886 --> 01:24:53.121
OF CALIFORNIA AT THAT TIME.

01:24:53.188 --> 01:24:53.988
SO.

01:24:54.055 --> 01:24:55.690
THAT IS THE HISTORY OF OF THE

01:24:55.757 --> 01:24:57.959
DOLLARS AND THE SCOPE HAS

01:24:58.026 --> 01:24:59.561
CHANGED HAS BEEN ADDED

01:24:59.627 --> 01:25:01.629
SUBTRACTED WE'VE ADDED

01:25:01.696 --> 01:25:03.331
REPLACEMENT FUNCTIONALITY -- FOR

01:25:03.398 --> 01:25:04.532
THE BACK OFFICE AT THE

01:25:04.599 --> 01:25:05.733
DEPARTMENT GENERAL SERVICES

01:25:05.800 --> 01:25:07.101
WHICH WAS OUT OF SCOPE AND IS

01:25:07.168 --> 01:25:09.370
NOW IN SCOPE AND WE DEPLOYED

01:25:09.437 --> 01:25:10.205
THAT SO THERE'S A NUMBER OF

01:25:10.271 --> 01:25:10.972
THINGS THAT.

01:25:11.039 --> 01:25:12.640
HAVE BEEN DONE THE PROJECT IS

01:25:12.707 --> 01:25:14.275
TREMENDOUSLY SUCCESSFUL.

01:25:14.342 --> 01:25:16.611
IN THAT A HUNDRED AND FIFTY TWO

01:25:16.678 --> 01:25:18.913
DEPARTMENTS ARE UTILIZING IT --

01:25:18.980 --> 01:25:21.449
FOR THEIR ACCOUNTING ALL STATE

01:25:21.516 --> 01:25:22.183
DEPARTMENTS ARE UTILIZING FOR

01:25:22.250 --> 01:25:24.118
THE DEVELOPMENT AND DEPLOYMENT

01:25:24.185 --> 01:25:25.453
OF TE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET.

01:25:25.520 --> 01:25:27.789
THE LAST THREE YEARS WE HAVE --

01:25:27.856 --> 01:25:28.656
THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET HAS BEEN

01:25:28.723 --> 01:25:30.558
INTRODUCED UTILIZING THE FISCAL

01:25:30.625 --> 01:25:31.626
SYSTEM.

01:25:31.693 --> 01:25:34.062
AND THE MAN SINCE TWENTY SIXTEEN

01:25:34.128 --> 01:25:34.696
WE HAVE PRETTY EIGHT BEEN ABLE

01:25:34.762 --> 01:25:36.831
TO PRODUCE A WEEK THE DEPARTMENT

01:25:36.898 --> 01:25:37.398
OF FINANCE HAS BEEN ABLE TO

01:25:37.465 --> 01:25:37.999
PRODUCE.

01:25:38.066 --> 01:25:39.534
THE ENACTED BUDGET WITH THE SAME

01:25:39.601 --> 01:25:40.969
LEVEL OF DETAIL THAT THE

01:25:41.035 --> 01:25:42.637
INTRODUCED BUDGET IS WHICH IS

01:25:42.704 --> 01:25:44.305
MUCH MORE BENEFICIAL TO THE

01:25:44.372 --> 01:25:46.307
LEGISLATURE TO THE PUBLIC AS A

01:25:46.374 --> 01:25:46.774
MINISTRY.

01:25:46.841 --> 01:25:49.410
IF I MAY COULD YOU JUST RESPOND

01:25:49.477 --> 01:25:50.812

CONTROLLERS LETTER BECAUSE AGAIN

01:25:52.614 --> 01:25:53.047
I THINK.

01:25:53.114 --> 01:25:54.415
WHAT I THOUGHT I WAS RESPONDING

01:25:54.482 --> 01:25:55.250
TO THE WHOLE FAILURE PIECE TO

01:25:55.316 --> 01:25:56.317
START THAT'S HELPFUL I I THINK

01:25:56.384 --> 01:25:57.452
WHAT THE PUBLIC CONTINUES TO

01:25:57.519 --> 01:25:58.052
HEAR?

01:25:58.119 --> 01:26:00.722
MORE DELAYS MORE BUREAUCRACIES.

01:26:00.788 --> 01:26:02.223
WHEN IT COMES TO WHY THIS IS THE

01:26:02.290 --> 01:26:02.891
CASE?

01:26:02.957 --> 01:26:04.325
I HAVE BEEN ON THIS COMMITTEE IN

01:26:04.392 --> 01:26:05.460
THE BUDGET COMMITTEE NOW THIS IS

01:26:05.527 --> 01:26:07.862

I SAY I THINK YOU KNOW I KEEP

01:26:09.330 --> 01:26:10.765
ASKING THESE QUESTIONS AND I AM

01:26:10.832 --> 01:26:12.166
TEMPTED NOT TO VOTE.

01:26:12.233 --> 01:26:13.167
FOR ANYTHING ELSE TO CONTINUE

01:26:13.234 --> 01:26:14.502
THIS PROGRAM BUT I KNOW HOW

01:26:14.569 --> 01:26:16.271
IMPORTANT IT IS AND WE'RE SURE

01:26:16.337 --> 01:26:17.171
EVERY SINGLE YEAR.

01:26:17.238 --> 01:26:18.973
THAT THINGS ARE ON TRACK AND

01:26:19.040 --> 01:26:20.575
THEN WE GET YET ANOTHER LETTER

01:26:20.642 --> 01:26:21.676
SAYING.

01:26:21.743 --> 01:26:24.212
THAT A KEY PARTNER IN THE

01:26:24.279 --> 01:26:25.980
FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT OF OUR

01:26:26.047 --> 01:26:26.881
STATE.

01:26:26.948 --> 01:26:34.022
DOES NOT HAVE FULL FAITH AND

01:26:34.088 --> 01:26:34.622
CONFIDENCE YET THAT THE SYSTEM

01:26:34.689 --> 01:26:35.356
IS READY TO GO.

01:26:35.423 --> 01:26:36.457
SO AGAIN AS SAID THE

01:26:36.524 --> 01:26:37.091
COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE DID STATE.

01:26:37.158 --> 01:26:37.759
THAT WE ARE WORKING WITH THEM TO

01:26:37.825 --> 01:26:38.426
PRIORITIZE WHATEVER ENHANCEMENTS

01:26:38.493 --> 01:26:40.728
WILL HELP ASSIST THE DEPARTMENTS.

01:26:40.795 --> 01:26:42.530
WE ARE WRECKED WE RECOGNIZE THAT

01:26:42.597 --> 01:26:43.831
THE DEPARTMENTS DO CONTINUE TO

01:26:43.898 --> 01:26:44.732
STRUGGLE.

01:26:44.799 --> 01:26:46.234
AND WE ARE RE PRIORITIZING AND

01:26:46.301 --> 01:26:47.368
REDIRECTING SOME OF THE EXISTING

01:26:47.435 --> 01:26:50.538
CONTRACT DOLLARS FROM.

01:26:50.605 --> 01:26:51.806
WORKING ON SOME OF THE FUTURE

01:26:51.873 --> 01:26:53.341
FUNCTIONALITY THAT THEY ARE

01:26:53.408 --> 01:26:54.175
TALKING ABOUT WHICH WE ARE

01:26:54.242 --> 01:26:55.443
DELAYING TO ASSIST THE

01:26:55.510 --> 01:26:57.879
DEPARTMENTS -- WITH THEIR MONTH

01:26:57.946 --> 01:26:59.347
ENDING YEAR AND CLOSE THERE IS

01:26:59.414 --> 01:27:01.249
KEY ENHANCEMENTS THAT WILL BE

01:27:01.316 --> 01:27:02.917
DEPLOYED IN HAVE BEEN DEPLOYED

01:27:02.984 --> 01:27:04.652
IN THE RECENT WEEKS.

01:27:04.719 --> 01:27:06.421
WE CONTINUE TO WE'VE IMPLEMENTED

01:27:06.487 --> 01:27:08.022
OVER TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY

01:27:08.089 --> 01:27:09.090
ENHANCEMENTS SINCE THE BEGINNING

01:27:09.157 --> 01:27:11.059
OF THIS YEAR. TO THE SYSTEM SO

01:27:11.125 --> 01:27:12.794
IT IS A CONSTANT DYNAMICALLY

01:27:12.860 --> 01:27:15.430
CHANGING SYSTEM TO MEET THE

01:27:15.496 --> 01:27:16.798
NEEDS AT ANY GIVEN TIME.

01:27:16.864 --> 01:27:18.199
OF A HUNDRED FIFTY TWO

01:27:18.266 --> 01:27:19.567
DEPARTMENTS EIGHTEEN THOUSAND

01:27:19.634 --> 01:27:21.002
AND USERS AND FOR CONTROL

01:27:21.069 --> 01:27:21.970
AGENCIES THAT ARE BOTH

01:27:22.036 --> 01:27:23.605
CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY

01:27:23.671 --> 01:27:25.139
RESPONSIBILITIES.

01:27:25.206 --> 01:27:26.741
SO THE COMPLEXITY OF THIS

01:27:26.808 --> 01:27:30.144
PROJECT CANNOT BE OVERSTATED AND

01:27:30.211 --> 01:27:34.148
I BELIEVE THAT WE ARE ON A PATH.

01:27:34.215 --> 01:27:35.416
TO GET THIS VERY I MEAN THAT WE

01:27:35.483 --> 01:27:36.884
ARE LESS THAN TWO HUNDRED

01:27:36.951 --> 01:27:39.754
REQUIREMENTS AT A FORTY FIVE

01:27:39.821 --> 01:27:40.622
HUNDRED OR FORTY TWO HUNDRED

01:27:40.688 --> 01:27:41.255
PLUS.

01:27:41.322 --> 01:27:43.091
REQUIREMENTS IN THE SYSTEM WHEN

01:27:43.157 --> 01:27:46.461
WE SET OUT THEY'VE BEEN DEPLOYED.

01:27:46.527 --> 01:27:47.362
AS WELL AS THE ENHANCEMENTS TO

01:27:47.428 --> 01:27:49.197
THE SYSTEM WE WILL CONTINUE TO

01:27:49.263 --> 01:27:50.231
PARTNER WITH THE COMPTROLLER'S

01:27:50.298 --> 01:27:51.799
OFFICE OF MY OTHER PARTNERS TO

01:27:51.866 --> 01:27:53.501
MAKE SURE THAT A QUALITY PRODUCT

01:27:53.568 --> 01:27:54.636
IS PUT OUT ON THE STREET AND

01:27:54.702 --> 01:27:55.737
THAT.

01:27:55.803 --> 01:27:59.107
WE DO NOT HAVE -- ISSUES WITH

01:27:59.173 --> 01:28:01.643
INTEGRITY OR QUALITY OF THAT YOU

01:28:01.709 --> 01:28:03.511
KNOW COULD HAPPEN IF WE RUSHED

01:28:03.578 --> 01:28:05.613
TO DEPLOYMENT BEFORE THE THE

01:28:05.680 --> 01:28:07.382
SYSTEM IS FULLY TESTED AND THIS

01:28:07.448 --> 01:28:09.550
DISTORTS REMAINING FUNCTIONALITY.

01:28:09.617 --> 01:28:12.186
IS ACCEPTED BY THE STATE

01:28:12.253 --> 01:28:14.656
COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE SO THE

01:28:14.722 --> 01:28:15.623
COMMITTEE REPORT SAYS THE

01:28:15.690 --> 01:28:17.025
CONTROLS FUNCTIONALITY WAS

01:28:17.091 --> 01:28:18.726
DELAYED REPEATEDLY AND IS STILL

01:28:18.793 --> 01:28:20.194
YEARS AWAY FROM BEING REALIZED.

01:28:20.261 --> 01:28:21.496
IT'S HARD TO BE SYMPATHETIC TO

01:28:21.562 --> 01:28:22.764
THE CALLS FOR YET ANOTHER DELAY

01:28:22.830 --> 01:28:23.865
USING THE SAME ARGUMENTS OF

01:28:23.931 --> 01:28:25.133
IMPENDING DOOM THAT BEEN USEFUL

01:28:25.199 --> 01:28:27.902
LAST FIVE YEARS WHAT'S THE

01:28:27.969 --> 01:28:29.937
WHAT'S THE DATE THAT WE WOULD

01:28:30.004 --> 01:28:32.040
EXPECT THAT THIS PROJECT WOULD

01:28:32.106 --> 01:28:33.207
BE FINALIZED.

01:28:33.274 --> 01:28:33.675
IF I GET ASKED TO THE

01:28:33.741 --> 01:28:35.510
COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE.

01:28:35.576 --> 01:28:37.345
GIVE ANY SENSE.

01:28:37.412 --> 01:28:38.780
AS FAR AS THE SCHEDULE GOES NOW

01:28:38.846 --> 01:28:40.982
WE'RE LOOKING AT JULY OF TWENTY

01:28:41.049 --> 01:28:42.016
TWENTY FOR THE FINAL TWO

01:28:42.083 --> 01:28:44.118
MILESTONES TO BE RELEASED.

01:28:44.185 --> 01:28:45.553
WHICH ARE MILESTONE FOREIGN

01:28:45.620 --> 01:28:48.756
MILESTONE FIVE I BELIEVE -- AND

01:28:48.823 --> 01:28:49.857
THAT WOULD BE THE LAST TWO

01:28:49.924 --> 01:28:52.160
PIECES OF FUNCTIONALITY THAT

01:28:52.226 --> 01:28:53.995
WOULD GO LIVE AT THAT POINT.

01:28:54.062 --> 01:28:56.631
OUR OUR OFFICE WOULD NEED TO

01:28:56.698 --> 01:28:57.999
PRODUCE A KAFFIR.

01:28:58.066 --> 01:28:59.300
ARTIFICE GAL.

01:28:59.367 --> 01:29:02.003
THE FOR THE FOR THAT FISCAL YEAR --

01:29:02.070 --> 01:29:03.237
SO IT TO TO BE ABLE TO SEE IF

01:29:03.304 --> 01:29:05.239
THE WORK PROPERLY TO PRODUCE THE

01:29:05.306 --> 01:29:06.340
KAFFIR WOULD TAKE ANOTHER

01:29:06.407 --> 01:29:07.875
ANOTHER YEARRIGHT IT WOULD BE.

01:29:07.942 --> 01:29:09.143
THE FOLLOWING FISCAL YEAR BUT

01:29:09.210 --> 01:29:10.478
THE FUNCTIONALITY WILL ALL BE IN

01:29:10.545 --> 01:29:13.981
PLACE BY JULY OF TWENTY TWENTY

01:29:14.048 --> 01:29:14.949
HAS THIS BEEN BROUGHT TO THE

01:29:15.016 --> 01:29:16.017
ATTENTION OF THE NEW GOVERNOR.

01:29:16.084 --> 01:29:19.153
A FEW DISCUSSES WITH HIS TEAM.

01:29:19.220 --> 01:29:21.022
WE HAVE BRIEFED ADMINISTRATION

01:29:21.089 --> 01:29:22.356

01:29:22.423 --> 01:29:24.225
AND ARE THEY WHAT WHAT IS THEIR

01:29:24.292 --> 01:29:27.795
PERSPECTIVE ON THIS -- AS I SAID

01:29:27.862 --> 01:29:29.797
IN MY EARLIER COMMENTS -- SO

01:29:29.864 --> 01:29:30.798
MINISTER COMMITTEE TAKES AN

01:29:30.865 --> 01:29:32.767
ACTION THAT WE EXPECT TO TAKE --

01:29:32.834 --> 01:29:35.236
TOMORROW -- YOU SHOULD EXPECTED

01:29:35.303 --> 01:29:36.604
MINISTRATION WILL SUBMIT A

01:29:36.671 --> 01:29:38.706
REVISED PROPOSAL BETWEEN NOW AND

01:29:38.773 --> 01:29:40.608
THE MAY REVISION FOR ADDITIONAL

01:29:40.675 --> 01:29:42.276
BUDGET EXPENDITURES TO PUSH THIS

01:29:42.343 --> 01:29:44.078
PROJECT ACROSS THE FINISH LINE

01:29:44.145 --> 01:29:45.613
HOW MUCH WHAT'S YOUR GUESS.

01:29:45.680 --> 01:29:47.849
NOT GONNA GET OUT IN FRONT OF

01:29:47.915 --> 01:29:48.449
THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL

01:29:48.516 --> 01:29:48.816
OKAY.

01:29:48.883 --> 01:29:50.384
FROM MY PERSPECTIVE I'M

01:29:50.451 --> 01:29:51.018
OBVIOUSLY GOING TO ONE OF WILL

01:29:51.085 --> 01:29:54.355
KNOW A LOT OF INFORMATION BEFORE

01:29:54.422 --> 01:29:55.957
I AM READY TO VOTE FOR THAT.

01:29:56.023 --> 01:29:56.991
AND I THINK MANY OF OUR

01:29:57.058 --> 01:29:57.992
COLLEAGUES WILL LIKELY FEEL THE

01:29:58.059 --> 01:29:59.594

?

01:30:46.707 --> 01:30:47.909
TWELVE THIS ITEM I THINK IS A

01:30:47.975 --> 01:30:50.178
LITTLE LESS CONTROVERSIAL.

01:30:50.244 --> 01:30:51.946
IF WE COULD GO TO THE

01:30:52.013 --> 01:30:52.547
COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE FOR YOUR

01:30:52.613 --> 01:30:53.915

THINK THINGS SHOULD WORK FAR TOO

01:37:52.700 --> 01:37:53.901
OFTEN WE FAIL TO ASK THE PEOPLE

LARGELY ONE OFF ONE DEPARTMENT

60% OF ALL IT PROJECTS FAIL AND

01:44:00.934 --> 01:44:02.736
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE UP AGAINST AND

01:44:02.803 --> 01:44:04.771
I THINK IT WAS -- APPROPRIATE

01:44:04.838 --> 01:44:05.872
THAT WE HAD THE ITEM AROUND

01:44:05.939 --> 01:44:07.474
FISCAL JUST A FEW ITEMS AGO

01:44:07.541 --> 01:44:08.875
BECAUSE THAT.

01:44:08.942 --> 01:44:10.143
TELLS YOU WHAT YOU'RE UP AGAINST.

01:44:10.210 --> 01:44:11.745
IN MY PERSPECTIVE IS -- THE

01:44:11.812 --> 01:44:13.380
VISION IS FANTASTIC AND THE

01:44:13.447 --> 01:44:15.349
DEVIL'S IN THE DETAILS RIGHT AND

01:44:15.415 --> 01:44:16.717
THERE DON'T SEEM TO BE A LOT OF

01:44:16.783 --> 01:44:18.185
DETAILS ON HOW THIS IS GONNA BE

01:44:18.251 --> 01:44:19.019
CARRIED OUT SO MY QUESTIONS

01:44:19.086 --> 01:44:19.853
REALLY.

01:44:19.920 --> 01:44:21.154
ARE JUST TRYING TO DRILL DOWN A

01:44:21.221 --> 01:44:22.889
LITTLE BIT ON QUESTIONS ARE

01:44:22.956 --> 01:44:24.024
RAISED IN THE COMMITTEE AND ALSO

01:44:24.091 --> 01:44:26.326
SOME QUESTIONS THAT WE ALL HAVE --

01:44:26.393 --> 01:44:28.428
THIS IS FOCUSED ON REALLY AN

01:44:28.495 --> 01:44:30.364
AGILE.

01:44:30.430 --> 01:44:31.932
APPROACH AN AGILE PROCUREMENT

01:44:31.999 --> 01:44:34.334
APPROACH -- BUT OBVIOUSLY OUR

01:44:34.401 --> 01:44:35.702
STATE HASN'T REALLY HAD THAT

01:44:35.769 --> 01:44:37.337
SKILL SET OR THAT EXPERTISE AND

01:44:37.404 --> 01:44:39.973
WONDERING HOW YOU PLAN TO BRING

01:44:40.040 --> 01:44:43.010
THAT IN QUICKLY -- I THINK

01:44:43.076 --> 01:44:44.711
RELATED TO THAT -- THEIR

01:44:44.778 --> 01:44:46.279
CONCERNS ABOUT HOW WE GROW THIS

01:44:46.346 --> 01:44:47.948
PROJECT OVER TIME AND WONDER IF

01:44:48.015 --> 01:44:49.249
YOU CAN JUST GIVE US A SENSE OF

01:44:49.316 --> 01:44:51.752
WHAT YOUR EXPECTATIONS ARE

01:44:51.818 --> 01:44:52.986
AROUND HELD BASS THIS OFFICE MY

01:44:53.053 --> 01:44:55.255
GROW -- AND THEN CLEARLY WE ALSO

01:44:55.322 --> 01:44:58.725
KNOW THAT -- STATE WORKERS AND

01:44:58.792 --> 01:44:59.893
BY AND BY THE STATE

01:44:59.960 --> 01:45:01.662
BUREAUCRACIES WILL BE CRITICAL

01:45:01.728 --> 01:45:02.195
TO MAKING THIS HAPPEN AND

01:45:02.262 --> 01:45:03.263
THERE'S ALWAYS BEEN A

01:45:03.330 --> 01:45:04.865
SIGNIFICANT TENSION WITH OUTSIDE

01:45:04.931 --> 01:45:06.266
TECH VENDORS WERE POINTED THE

01:45:06.333 --> 01:45:07.968
FINGER AT STATE BUREAUCRATS WILL

01:45:08.035 --> 01:45:09.703
POINT FINGERS BACK AT TECHNOLOGY

01:45:09.770 --> 01:45:10.604
WORKERS.

01:45:10.671 --> 01:45:11.938
CAN YOU GIVE US A SENSE OF HOW

01:45:12.005 --> 01:45:14.207
YOU PLAN TO MANAGE.

01:45:14.274 --> 01:45:15.709
THE PAST TENSIONS AND AND MOVE

01:45:15.776 --> 01:45:17.077
IT INTO MORE POSITIVE FUTURE

01:45:17.144 --> 01:45:20.580
SURE FOR FIRST LET ME START BY

01:45:20.647 --> 01:45:22.449
BY -- RESTATING THIS IS NOT

01:45:22.516 --> 01:45:23.283
ABOUT TECHNOLOGY THIS IS NOT

01:45:23.350 --> 01:45:24.217
ABOUT INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY

01:45:24.284 --> 01:45:25.919
PROJECTS THIS IS ABOUT SERVICE

01:45:25.986 --> 01:45:27.387
DELIVERY MUCH OF WHAT'S GOING TO

01:45:27.454 --> 01:45:28.588
IS GOING TO HAPPEN IN THE

01:45:28.655 --> 01:45:29.823
DIGITAL SPACE THAT'S WHERE

01:45:29.890 --> 01:45:31.124
SOCIETY IS TODAY.

01:45:31.191 --> 01:45:33.026
SO SO DON'T THINK OF THIS IN

01:45:33.093 --> 01:45:34.528
TERMS OF BUYING OR BUILDING BIG

01:45:34.594 --> 01:45:36.730
STATE IT PROJECTS IT'S ABOUT

01:45:36.797 --> 01:45:38.231
FOCUSING ON SERVICE DELIVERY HOW

01:45:38.298 --> 01:45:39.633
WE DELIVER SERVICES TO CUSTOMERS

01:45:39.700 --> 01:45:41.068
WHERE THE PAIN POINTS FOR THE

01:45:41.134 --> 01:45:42.269
PEOPLE TO HAVE TO DO BUSINESS

01:45:42.335 --> 01:45:43.570
WITH THE GOVERNMENT HOW TO MAKE

01:45:43.637 --> 01:45:44.371
LIFE EASIER FOR THEM HOW.

01:45:44.438 --> 01:45:45.772
CAN WE MAKE THE PROCESS MORE

01:45:45.839 --> 01:45:48.341
INTUITIVE EASIER UBIQUITOUS TO A

01:45:48.408 --> 01:45:50.110
JUST LIKE THEIR LIVES ARE TODAY

01:45:50.177 --> 01:45:51.078
WITH MOBILE PHONES AND COMPUTERS

01:45:51.144 --> 01:45:52.979
AND AND PORTABLE DEVICES THEY

01:45:53.046 --> 01:45:54.114
THERE THERE IS VIRTUALLY NO

01:45:54.181 --> 01:45:56.983
LIMIT ON YOUR PERSONAL LIFE AND

01:45:57.050 --> 01:45:57.484
HOW YOU INTERACT WITH.

01:45:57.551 --> 01:45:59.286
BUSINESSES AND YOUR FRIENDS AND

01:45:59.352 --> 01:46:00.954
FAMILY AND EVERYTHING ELSE.

01:46:01.021 --> 01:46:01.822
EXCEPT THAT WHEN YOU GET TO THE

01:46:01.888 --> 01:46:03.490
STATE LEVEL THE THE STATE FORCES

01:46:03.557 --> 01:46:04.991
YOU INTO NINETEEN SIXTIES AND

01:46:05.058 --> 01:46:06.560
SEVENTIES BUSINESS PROCESSES.

01:46:06.626 --> 01:46:07.060
MANY OF WHICH HAVE BEEN

01:46:07.127 --> 01:46:09.896
AUTOMATED AND PUT ON A WEB AND

01:46:09.963 --> 01:46:11.231
THEY'RE NOT VERY INTUITIVE THEY

01:46:11.298 --> 01:46:11.998
DON'T HAVE FULL FUNCTIONALITY

01:46:12.065 --> 01:46:13.667
THEY DON'T PROVIDE INFORMATION

01:46:13.734 --> 01:46:14.868
THEY DON'T HAVE OPEN DATA.

01:46:14.935 --> 01:46:16.203
THAT THERE'S A THERE'S A LOT A

01:46:16.269 --> 01:46:17.437
LOT OF BAD OUT THERE AND LOT OF

01:46:17.504 --> 01:46:19.239
PROBLEMS ARE TRYING TO SOLVE.

01:46:19.306 --> 01:46:20.841
AND BUT THIS IS ABOUT A TARGETED

01:46:20.907 --> 01:46:22.109
EFFORT TO TO FOCUS ON THE

01:46:22.175 --> 01:46:23.643
DELIVERY OF GOVERNMENT SERVICES

01:46:23.710 --> 01:46:24.978
TO THE PEOPLE WE SERVE AND THIS

01:46:25.045 --> 01:46:27.180
MODEL HAS BEEN DONE SUCCESSFULLY

01:46:27.247 --> 01:46:28.582
AROUND THE GLOBE SO WE'RE NOT

01:46:28.648 --> 01:46:29.850
INVENTING SOMETHING NEW HERE WE

01:46:29.916 --> 01:46:30.984
ARE IN FACT TAKING.

01:46:31.051 --> 01:46:33.487
A GOVERNMENT LED MODEL THAT --

01:46:33.553 --> 01:46:35.055
WAS VERY SUCCESSFUL IN EUROPE

01:46:35.122 --> 01:46:36.056
HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL AT THE

01:46:36.123 --> 01:46:37.290
FEDERAL LEVEL UNITED STATES HAS

01:46:37.357 --> 01:46:38.158
BEEN SUCCESSFUL AT THE LOCAL

01:46:38.225 --> 01:46:42.095
LEVEL IN OTHER PLACES AND WE'RE

01:46:42.162 --> 01:46:43.864
SIMPLY SAYING.

01:46:43.930 --> 01:46:44.431
DO YOU KNOW WHAT WEEK WE GET

01:46:44.498 --> 01:46:45.799
BEAT UP WHEN THINGS GO BAD WE WE

01:46:45.866 --> 01:46:47.134
RIGHTFULLY ARE TAKING OUR LUMPS

01:46:47.200 --> 01:46:48.735
OVER WHAT'S HAPPENING AT DMB.

01:46:48.802 --> 01:46:50.036
AND AND AND WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO

01:46:50.103 --> 01:46:51.772
FIX THAT THIS IS A MORE SYSTEMIC

01:46:51.838 --> 01:46:53.340
APPROACH TO FIXING THOSE THINGS

01:46:53.406 --> 01:46:56.076
PROACTIVELY AS OPPOSED TO FIXING

01:46:56.143 --> 01:46:56.710
REACTIVE WE WANT SOMETHING BLOWS

01:46:56.777 --> 01:46:57.444
UP.

01:46:57.511 --> 01:46:59.045
SO I I WOULD I WOULD I WOULD ASK

01:46:59.112 --> 01:47:00.313
THAT WE LOOK AT THIS THROUGH THE

01:47:00.380 --> 01:47:01.681
LENS OF SERVICE DELIVERY AND NOT

01:47:01.748 --> 01:47:03.316
LINK IT NECESSARILY TO OUR

01:47:03.383 --> 01:47:04.484
HISTORY WITH BIG IT PROJECTS

01:47:04.551 --> 01:47:06.019
BECAUSE NOTHING WHAT WE'RE DOING

01:47:06.086 --> 01:47:07.120
HERE IS ABOUT THE GUY TO

01:47:07.187 --> 01:47:09.356
PROSECUTE YOU GIVE.

01:47:09.422 --> 01:47:11.091
ANY EXAMPLES OF WHAT YOUR VISION.

01:47:11.158 --> 01:47:12.325
WHAT ON WHAT LIKE IN WHAT

01:47:12.392 --> 01:47:13.260
CONTEXT?

01:47:13.326 --> 01:47:15.595
ANY CONTEXT WHAT WHAT WHAT ARE

01:47:15.662 --> 01:47:16.730
YOU GONNA TACKLE FILM SO SO

01:47:16.797 --> 01:47:18.331
WE'VE WE'VE IDENTIFIED A COUPLE

01:47:18.398 --> 01:47:19.933
OF OF PRELIMINARY TARGET

01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:20.934
OPPORTUNITY.

01:47:21.001 --> 01:47:23.537
PARCHMENTS DEPARTMENT MOTOR

01:47:23.603 --> 01:47:24.805
VEHICLES BEING.

01:47:24.871 --> 01:47:25.572
ONE WHERE -- IT'S RIGHT FOR AN

01:47:25.639 --> 01:47:28.608
ENTIRE REVISIT OF HOW THEY HOW

01:47:28.675 --> 01:47:29.876
THEY SERVE THE PUBLIC AND WE'VE

01:47:29.943 --> 01:47:31.011
LOOKED AT AND WE'RE TALKING

01:47:31.077 --> 01:47:32.245
ABOUT THE BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS

01:47:32.312 --> 01:47:33.446
IN THE LICENSING FUNCTIONS THAT

01:47:33.513 --> 01:47:35.949
THE PARTNER CONSUMER AFFAIRS

01:47:36.016 --> 01:47:36.483
WHICH HAS BEEN A CONSTANT

01:47:36.550 --> 01:47:39.319
STRUGGLE -- AS THEIR STARTING

01:47:39.386 --> 01:47:41.021
POINTS BUT WE'RE ALSO ALONG WITH

01:47:41.087 --> 01:47:43.223
THIS IS IS THE THE BUILDING OF

01:47:43.290 --> 01:47:45.091
THE BIT ACADEMY IN DELIVERING

01:47:45.158 --> 01:47:46.293
THE TRAINING TO HELP DRIVE THE

01:47:46.359 --> 01:47:47.861
CULTURAL CHANGE THE DRIVE THAT

01:47:47.928 --> 01:47:49.329
MINDSET CHANGE.

01:47:49.396 --> 01:47:50.363
AND THEN WITH THE INNOVATION

01:47:50.430 --> 01:47:51.965
FUND AND THE DEPARTMENT THE

01:47:52.032 --> 01:47:53.300
OFFICE BEING ABLE TO GO OUT AND

01:47:53.366 --> 01:47:54.701
LEAD DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS ON A

01:47:54.768 --> 01:47:56.136
PARTY BASIS FOR DEPARTMENTS

01:47:56.203 --> 01:47:57.370
MAYBE IT'S BUILDING A NEW APP

01:47:57.437 --> 01:47:59.105
MAYBE IT'S REDESIGNING -- THE

01:47:59.172 --> 01:48:02.442
WAY YOU REGISTER OR RENEW YOUR

01:48:02.509 --> 01:48:04.744
VEHICLE REGISTRATION -- AND

01:48:04.811 --> 01:48:05.712
BRINGING THAT TO BRING THAT TO

01:48:05.779 --> 01:48:07.113
BEAR TO THE PUBLIC AS A NEW

01:48:07.180 --> 01:48:08.281
INNOVATIVE SERVICE AND THEN THE

01:48:08.348 --> 01:48:09.382
THINGS WE'VE LEARNED ALONG THE

01:48:09.449 --> 01:48:11.184
WAY DOING THAT WE WILL THEN HAND

01:48:11.251 --> 01:48:12.619
OFF TO OTHER DEPARTMENTS WHO

01:48:12.686 --> 01:48:13.753
HAVE SIMILAR BUSINESS PROCESS

01:48:13.820 --> 01:48:16.356
NEEDS. TO TO TAKE IT TO SCALE

01:48:16.423 --> 01:48:17.557
AND APPLIED ACROSS EXECUTIVE

01:48:17.624 --> 01:48:19.626
BRANCH COULD YOU GIVE US SOME

01:48:19.693 --> 01:48:21.528
EXAMPLES OF WHERE THIS IS WORK

01:48:21.595 --> 01:48:22.596
ELSEWHERE AND I YOU ALLUDED TO

01:48:22.662 --> 01:48:23.997
THEM BUT YEAH IN IT THAT'S

01:48:24.064 --> 01:48:25.899
WORKED IN GREAT BRITAIN -- THEY

01:48:25.966 --> 01:48:27.801
HAVE THERE'S THERE'S A TON OF

01:48:27.868 --> 01:48:28.368
MATERIAL OUT THERE ABOUT THE

01:48:28.435 --> 01:48:30.103
SUCCESSES -- THE PROJECTS

01:48:30.170 --> 01:48:32.272
THEY'VE DONE AND HOW VALUABLE

01:48:32.339 --> 01:48:33.907
SPEND AND THEY STARTED.

01:48:33.974 --> 01:48:36.009
IN ENGLAND WITH -- ALL THEIR

01:48:36.076 --> 01:48:37.644
VARIOUS WEB DOMAINS IT WAS IT

01:48:37.711 --> 01:48:40.146
WAS A A MISMATCH ACROSS THE YOU

BRING ALL THAT INTO A SINGLE

01:48:44.284 --> 01:48:45.118
PLATFORM.

01:48:45.185 --> 01:48:46.553
AND A SINGLE PORTAL FOR THE

01:48:46.620 --> 01:48:48.755
CITIZENS OF THE U. K. TO ACCESS

01:48:48.822 --> 01:48:49.256

SERVICES DID SOMETHING THAT WE

01:48:56.630 --> 01:48:57.764
NEED TO LOOK TO IN CALIFORNIA

01:48:57.831 --> 01:48:59.866
AND THEY DID -- LOG IN DOT GOV

01:48:59.933 --> 01:49:00.901
WHICH IS A SORT OF US.

01:49:00.967 --> 01:49:03.069
IDENTITY MANAGEMENT FEATURE FOR

01:49:03.136 --> 01:49:05.071
US CITIZENS ACCESSING CERTAIN

01:49:05.138 --> 01:49:06.273
GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS IN A BILL

01:49:06.339 --> 01:49:08.008
DIDN'T HAVE NOW EXTENDED THAT

01:49:08.074 --> 01:49:09.242
SAME FUNCTIONALITY THAT CITY

01:49:09.309 --> 01:49:10.243
BUILT IN SUCH A WAY THAT THEY

01:49:10.310 --> 01:49:11.411
CAN EASILY LINK IT TO OTHER

01:49:11.478 --> 01:49:12.545
DEPARTMENTS TO HAVE SOMEWHERE

01:49:12.612 --> 01:49:13.480
IDENTITY MANAGEMENT IS A NEVER

01:49:13.546 --> 01:49:14.514
ROLLED OUT ACROSS A NUMBER OF

AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL AND THERE'S

01:49:18.251 --> 01:49:24.991
THERE THERE'S THERE'S A TON OF

01:49:25.058 --> 01:49:26.726
OF INFORMATION OUT THERE ABOUT

01:49:26.793 --> 01:49:27.694
THE GOOD WORK BEING DONE IN THE

01:49:27.761 --> 01:49:28.194
SPACE AROUND THE WORLD.

01:49:28.261 --> 01:49:29.429
AND GIVEN YOU YOU YOU POINTED TO

01:49:29.496 --> 01:49:29.963
TWO DEPARTMENTS THAT HAVE

01:49:30.030 --> 01:49:31.765
HISTORICALLY ABSOLUTELY OBJECT

01:49:31.831 --> 01:49:34.501
WE FAILED AT THINK ABOUT THE USE

01:49:34.567 --> 01:49:36.503
OF IT DMV AND THE PARTY CONSUMER

01:49:36.569 --> 01:49:37.704
SERVICES.

01:49:37.771 --> 01:49:40.006
DCA WHAT'S WHAT'S THE THINKING

01:49:40.073 --> 01:49:42.976
ON WHAT YOU WOULD DO NEXT GIVEN

INTEREST FOR MANY OF US IN THE

01:50:46.106 --> 01:50:47.474

CALL IT GYPSY FOR SUPPORT

01:57:12.792 --> 01:57:14.093
BECAUSE IT'S KIND OF FOR SHORT

01:57:14.160 --> 01:57:15.261
IT'S KIND OF A MOUTH FULL.

01:57:15.328 --> 01:57:16.763
WHICH IS THE STUDY BEING CREATED

01:57:16.829 --> 01:57:18.331

01:57:22.802 --> 01:57:24.337
IMPORTANT DATA SETS FOLLOWING

01:57:24.404 --> 01:57:26.038
THE TWENTY TWENTY CENSUS.

IDENTIFY HOW SUCCESSFUL WE WERE

01:57:29.809 --> 01:57:31.477
IN ACHIEVING A FULL AND COMPLETE

01:57:31.544 --> 01:57:32.044

01:57:39.285 --> 01:57:40.720
THE TWENTY THIRTY CENSUS.

01:57:40.787 --> 01:57:41.788
THIS LAST POINT IS IMPORTANT

01:57:41.854 --> 01:57:43.122
BECAUSE THE CENSUS OFFICE IS

01:57:43.189 --> 01:57:45.057
WORKING DILIGENTLY NOT ONLY TO

01:57:45.124 --> 01:57:46.692

STATE AGAIN FOR THE TWENTY

01:57:55.034 --> 01:57:55.968
THIRTY CENSUS.

01:57:56.035 --> 01:57:57.236
THIS WILL SAVE TIME AND

01:57:57.303 --> 01:57:59.505
RESOURCES FOR ONE PREPARATION

01:57:59.572 --> 01:58:01.007
FOR THE NEXT CYCLE BEGINS.

FOR STATEWIDE OUTREACH EFFORTS

RELATED TO INCREASING THAT PART

01:58:24.430 --> 01:58:26.632
PARTICIPATION RATE.

01:58:26.699 --> 01:58:27.567
I HOPEWE DON'T HAVE ANY

01:58:27.633 --> 01:58:28.835
CONCERNS AT THE PROPOSAL AND WE

WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT THAT'S

01:58:29.969 --> 01:58:32.638
CONSISTENT WITH PAST --

01:58:32.705 --> 01:58:35.007
LEGISLATIVE ACTION IN THIS AREA.

PUSH FOR ADDITIONAL FUNDING WHEN

01:58:47.386 --> 01:58:49.388
IT CAME TO THE CENSUS -- I HAVE

01:58:49.455 --> 01:58:50.690
ALWAYS BEEN OF THE PERSPECTIVE

01:58:50.756 --> 01:58:52.191
THAT WE ARE STILL WOEFULLY SHORT

01:58:52.258 --> 01:58:54.760
WHEN IT COMES TO TO OUT REACH --

01:58:54.827 --> 01:58:56.562
OFTENTIMES THOSE OF US WHO ARE

01:58:56.629 --> 01:58:57.763
ELECTED OFFICE.

01:58:57.830 --> 01:58:59.065
GENERAL THERE'S MANY MANY MANY

01:58:59.131 --> 01:59:01.000
TIMES THIS TO REACH OUT TO OUR

01:59:01.067 --> 01:59:02.735
CONSTITUENTS JUST EDUCATE THEM

01:59:02.802 --> 01:59:04.570
ON ONE ELECTION.

01:59:04.637 --> 01:59:07.206
AND HERE WE ARE TALKING ABOUT --

01:59:07.273 --> 01:59:08.741
SOMETHING THAT IS OF A OF A

01:59:08.808 --> 01:59:10.142
MAGNITUDE OF WHAT'S AT STAKE SO

01:59:10.209 --> 01:59:11.878
MUCH GREATER THAN ANY INDIVIDUAL

01:59:11.944 --> 01:59:13.112
ACTION AND SO.

01:59:13.179 --> 01:59:15.214
I CERTAINLY SUPPORT I KNOW A

01:59:15.281 --> 01:59:16.949
CALL FOR MORE FUNDING AROUND OUT

01:59:17.016 --> 01:59:18.784
REGIONAL JUST MENTION THAT WHEN

01:59:18.851 --> 01:59:20.453
I WAS THE PRESIDENT OF THE SAN

01:59:20.520 --> 01:59:21.721
FRANCISCO BOARD OF SUPERVISORS

01:59:21.787 --> 01:59:23.089
WORKING WITH THEN MAYOR GAVIN

01:59:23.155 --> 01:59:25.458
NEWSOM -- WE INVESTED

01:59:25.525 --> 01:59:26.826
SIGNIFICANT SAN FRANCISCO

01:59:26.893 --> 01:59:29.228
DOLLARS INTO HOW TO HARD TO

01:59:29.295 --> 01:59:31.564
REACH POPULATIONS INVESTING

01:59:31.631 --> 01:59:33.032
SPECIFICALLY AN OUT REACH.

01:59:33.099 --> 01:59:34.267
AND WE WERE THE ONE MAJOR COUNTY

01:59:34.333 --> 01:59:36.869
AS YOU KNOW THAT DID NOT SEE A

01:59:36.936 --> 01:59:39.238
REAL DROP IN ARE HARD TO REACH --

01:59:39.305 --> 01:59:41.641
POPULATIONS WHEN IT CAME TO THAT

01:59:41.707 --> 01:59:43.776
CENSUS. TWENTY TEN AND SO IT'S

01:59:43.843 --> 01:59:44.677
MY PERSPECTIVE WE WE NEED TO

01:59:44.744 --> 01:59:46.445
DOUBLE DOWN -- BECAUSE WE KNOW

01:59:46.512 --> 01:59:47.914
THAT EVERY DOLLAR WE INVEST

01:59:47.980 --> 01:59:50.950
TODAY WILL MEAN LITERALLY MANY

01:59:51.017 --> 01:59:52.285
MANY TIMES THAT AS FAR AS

01:59:52.351 --> 01:59:53.619
FEDERAL FUNDING WE CAN RECEIVE

01:59:53.686 --> 01:59:54.887
AND OTHER BENEFITS THE STATE

01:59:54.954 --> 01:59:55.521
COULD RECEIVE.

01:59:55.588 --> 01:59:57.056
RELATED TO CENSUS I ALSO

01:59:57.123 --> 01:59:58.291
UNDERSTAND THAT THERE HAS BEEN A

01:59:58.357 --> 01:59:59.559
REQUEST FOR ADDITIONAL MEDIA

01:59:59.625 --> 02:00:01.527
OUTREACH -- WHICH IS SOMETHING

02:00:01.594 --> 02:00:03.095
THAT I WOULD ALSO SUPPORT GIVEN

02:00:03.162 --> 02:00:04.630
THE DIVERSITY OF OUR STATE GIVEN

02:00:04.697 --> 02:00:06.065
THE CHALLENGES OF COMMUNICATING

02:00:06.132 --> 02:00:07.366
AND GIVEN THE SUCCESSES THAT WE

02:00:07.433 --> 02:00:08.968
SAW WHEN IT CAME TO THE

02:00:09.035 --> 02:00:10.369
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ACA.

02:00:10.436 --> 02:00:12.672
AND MEDICAL EXPANSION I THINK

02:00:12.738 --> 02:00:13.239
THAT WOULD BE AN APPROPRIATE

02:00:13.306 --> 02:00:14.040
CONVERSATION.

02:00:14.106 --> 02:00:15.074
WE'RE NOT GONNA HAVE A SPECIFIC

02:00:15.141 --> 02:00:15.975
CONVERSATION TODAY ABOUT HOW

02:00:16.042 --> 02:00:19.345
MUCH WE THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE.

02:00:19.412 --> 02:00:20.613
TO INCREASE THE OUT REACH BUDGET

02:00:20.680 --> 02:00:22.114
OR THE MEDIA OUTRAGE BUDGET BUT

02:00:22.181 --> 02:00:23.616
SUFFICE IT TO SAY.

02:00:23.683 --> 02:00:25.217
THIS IS AN AREA THAT I WOULD

02:00:25.284 --> 02:00:27.386

IF WE TOOK A MERE FRACTION OF

02:00:34.126 --> 02:00:37.163
WHAT WE WASTED IN I. T. O. FOR

02:00:37.229 --> 02:00:38.931

02:00:38.998 --> 02:00:39.832
HERE.

02:00:39.899 --> 02:00:41.867
OR IN OTHER AREAS WE WOULD BE

02:00:41.934 --> 02:00:43.703
FAR BETTER OFF AS A STATE FAR

02:00:43.769 --> 02:00:45.338
BETTER OFF PHYSICALLY -- AND I

02:00:45.404 --> 02:00:48.040

02:21:36.054 --> 02:21:38.356
TO BE FAMILIAR WITH THE CENSUS.

02:21:38.423 --> 02:21:39.591
MOST LIKELY TO SAY THAT THEIR

02:21:39.657 --> 02:21:41.125
ANSWERS TO THE SENSES WILL BE

02:21:41.192 --> 02:21:42.227
USED AGAINST THEM.

02:21:42.293 --> 02:21:45.663

02:43:42.078 --> 02:43:43.079
HAVE COME TO EMBRACE.

02:43:43.146 --> 02:43:44.414
BEING THAT I WAS IN THEATER I

02:43:44.481 --> 02:43:46.449
WAS ABLE TO TAKE CERTAIN MUSIC

02:43:46.516 --> 02:43:48.885
PIECES CERTAIN ART PIECES AND

02:43:48.952 --> 02:43:51.888
UTILIZE THEM BETWEEN BREAKS.

02:43:51.955 --> 02:43:53.223
IN THOSE THINGS AND HAVE THESE

02:43:53.290 --> 02:43:55.292
YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN COME AND SEE

02:43:55.358 --> 02:43:56.626

ONLY HOW THEY SAW THIS SOCIETY

02:44:06.736 --> 02:44:08.138

02:44:08.205 --> 02:44:10.006
COMMUNITY STARTED TO SEE THEM.

02:44:10.073 --> 02:44:12.075
AND THAT INCREASES ONE'S SELF

02:44:12.142 --> 02:44:14.344
ESTEEM IN A WAY TO WERE BY THEIR

02:44:14.411 --> 02:44:17.180
NOT LOOKING ANYMORE TO PREY UPON
