LEGISLATIVE HEARING OF THE ASSEMBLY COMMITTEES ON GOVERNMENT ORGANIZATION BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS AND HEALTH TO PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF VAPING TOBACCO CANNABIS PRODUCTS HEALTH EFFECTS AND DEFICIENCIES IN REGULATION CURRENT LAW. LIKE TO BEGIN BY WELCOMING THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND THANKING THEM FOR BEING HERE OUR WITNESSES AND CERTAINLY THE GENERAL PUBLIC FOR YOUR TENNIS TODAY. I'D LIKE TO THANK THE STAFF FROM THE RESPECTIVE COMMITTEES FOR PUTTING TOGETHER AN INDEPTH AGENDA ON THIS IMPORTANT AND TIMELY TOPIC. THIS JOINT INFORMATION HERE WILL BE THE FIRST OF TWO HEARINGS ON THE SUBJECT OF YOU CIGARETTES AND VAPING. TODAY'S HEARING WILL PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF THE ISSUES RELATED TO VAPING INCLUDING THE HEALTH OF FACTS AND REGULATORY LANDSCAPE WITH TESTIMONY PROVIDED BY MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS TO BACK ON VAPING EXPERTS AND STATE GOVERNMENT REGULATORS. THE HEARING WILL ALSO LOOK INTO THE GROWING POPULARITY BE CIGARETTES IN VAPING EXAMINE THE OVERALL. IMPACT ON USE AND GENERAL CONSUMERS. E. CIGARETTES OR VAPING DEVICES WITH SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS IN ANNUAL SALES OF BECOME PART OF THE DAILY LIFE FOR MILLIONS OF AMERICANS. VAPING IS RISEN DRAMATICALLY IN POPULARITY AROUND THE WORLD FROM SEVEN MILLION USERS IN TWENTY ELEVEN TO OVER THIRTY FIVE MILLION USERS TODAY. AS THIS HAPPENS TRADITIONAL TOBACCO SMOKING RATES CONTINUE TO DECLINE. HOWEVER RECENT STUDIES HAVE FOUND THAT MORE THAN HALF OF AMERICAN ADULTS E. CIGARETTE USERS ARE UNDER THIRTY FIVE YEARS OF AGE FUELING CONCERN ABOUT THE POPULARITY OF VAPING AMONG YOUNG PEOPLE. YOUTH ACCESS AND USES SKYROCKETED WITH THE PREPARATION OF FLAVORS ATTRACTED TO THE TEENAGERS SUCH AS BAZOOKA JOE BUBBLE GUM COTTON CANDY AND GUMMY BEARS. FEDERAL STATISTICS SHOW A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN VAPING AMONG TEENS BETWEEN TWENTY SEVENTEEN TWENTY EIGHTEEN. MORE THAN ONE IN FOUR HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS REPORTED VAPING IN THE PAST MONTH. UP FROM ONE IN FIVE STUDENTS IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN. THE SERVER YOU SOMEONE MIDDLE STUDENTS HAS ALSO MIDDLE SCHOOL STUDENTS HAS ALSO INCREASED. FEDERAL HEALTH OFFICIALS ARE CALLING THIS TROUBLING TREND AN EPIDEMIC IN FEAR THAT TEENAGERS WHO VAPE WILL EVENTUALLY START SMOKING. BUT NOW AS A LEGISLATURE WE'RE NOT ONLY FACED WITH THE ISSUES OF RAPID RISE IN TEEN E. CIGARETTE USE BUT A NATIONAL OUTBREAK OF MYSTERIOUS LONG INJURY CASES. ASSOCIATED WITH THE USE OF VAPING PRODUCTS. THE CDC NOW REPORTS SERVING THIRTEEN HUNDRED VAPING ELLIS'S AT LEAST TWENTY SIX NATION WIDE LINKED TO THE USE OF THE CIGARETTES. AND RAPING. THERE ARE NO MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED. NEW CASES REPORTED JUST LAST WEEK AND THE CDC TOLD CONGRESS THIS MORNING THAT THE STATISTICS ARE UNFORTUNATE EXPECTED TO INCREASE CONSIDERABLY IN THE NEAR FUTURE. THE MEDIAN AGE OF DC'S TO PATIENTS WAS FORTY NINE YEARS OLD. THE RANGE WAS FROM SEVENTEEN TO SEVENTY FIVE YEARS OLD. ACCORDING TO RECENT FINDINGS BY THE CDC MOST OF THE PATIENTS IMPACTED BY THESE ILLNESSES REPORTED USING T. H. C. CONTAINING PRODUCTS SUGGESTING THG PRODUCTS ARE PLAYING A ROLE IN THESE ELLIPSES. THAT SAID SOME PATIENTS HAVE REPORTED USING BOTH THC PRODUCTS AND NICOTINE PRODUCTS AS WELL AS A SMALLER NUMBER REPORTING USING ONLY NICOTINE PRODUCTS. SIMILAR TESTING ON THE SAMPLES COLLECTED OR RECEIVED BY THE FDA SHOWS A VARIETY OF PRODUCTS OR PRODUCT COMPONENTS WITH DIFFERENT INGREDIENTS OR DELIVERY SYSTEMS MAKING THIS INVESTIGATION ESPECIALLY CHALLENGING. AUTHORITIES ARE STILL GATHERING INFORMATION BUT ACCORDING TO RECENT REPORTS PATIENTS WITH THE CONDITION SEEM TO BE OVERWHELMINGLY MALE AROUND 70% WITH 80% OF PATIENTS UNDER AGE THIRTY FIVE. ACCORDING TO THE CDC THERE THE INVESTIGATION IS ONGOING AND NO SINGLE BRAND PRODUCT SUBSTANCE OR ADDITIVE HAS BEEN LINKED TO ALL CASES. WHILE THE CAUSE OF THE OUTBREAK REMAINS UNKNOWN THE CDC WARNS AGAINST THE USE OF ANY CIGARETTE OR ANY PAPER PRODUCT. ASIDE FROM THE RECENT WIRELESS'S OUTBREAK THE LONG TERM HEALTH EFFECTS OF CONTINUED EAST CIGARETTE VAPING USE REMAIN ON NO ONE IS A SCIENTIFIC COMMUNICANT IN USED TO STUDY THE HEALTH HAZARDS. POSED BY THIS TECHNOLOGY. BOTTOM LINE WE STILL DO NOT HAVE ALL THE ANSWERS BUT AS A LEGISLATURE MUST GET A GRASP ON THE MULTIPLE CASES SURROUNDING THE CIGARETTES PEIPING. WE MUST CONSIDER THE HEALTH AND SAFETY CONCERNS IMPACTS ON YOUTH BLACK MARKET ENFORCEMENT ISSUES AND THERE IS AN ADEQUATE STATE REGULATION OVERSIGHT. WE NEED TO IDENTIFY WHERE EXISTING EFFORTS HAVE FAILED AND DISCUSS EXPERT RECOMMENDATIONS TO REVERSE THE DEEPLY CONCERNING EPIDEMIC OF BEAUTY CIGARETTE USE A BABY NEWS. IN CHILDREN'S AND FAMILIES ACROSS CALIFORNIA. THEY WILL SERVICE AN OPPORTUNITY TO ESTABLISH A CONSISTENT SET OF FACTS SO THERE WERE ALL OPERATING OFF THE SAME SET OF FACTS AND HIGHLIGHT THE BEST AVAILABLE INFORMATION WE CURRENTLY HAVE. I WOULD NOW ASK CHAIRMAN LOW FOR HIS OPENING REMARKS. THANK YOU VERY. MUCH I MISTER CHAIR AND AGAIN THANK YOU VERY MUCH TO THE COLLECTIVE WORK OF OUR RESPECTIVE COMMITTEES AND FORMING THIS IMPRINT THIS AGAIN I KNOW THAT THIS IS JUST THE BEGINNING OF THE CONVERSATION THAT WE HAVE TO BE. AS RESPONSIVE TO CONSUMER PROTECTION AND THE CONSTITUENCIES THAT WE REPRESENTS A SIMILE WITHIN THE RESPECT OF A BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS YOU HIT ON THE HEAD MISTER CHAIR BUT- OUR IN REGARDS TO THE- THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND CANNABIS. AND I'M PART OF THE CRISIS ON VAPING IS WITH RESPECT TO THE FAILURE OF THE REGULATORY SYSTEM AND TO WHICH THE LEGAL ACCESS TO QUALITY REGULATED CANNABIS. PRODUCTS ARE THE STATE IS RELATIVELY LIMITED IN FACT AS WE WELL KNOW ROUGHLY THREE QUARTERS OF CITIES AND COUNTIES. HAVE BEEN LICENSE CANNABIS RETAILERS SITTING THOSE AREAS TO UNLICENSED UNREGULATED UNTAXED AND UNTESTED ILLICIT MARKET OPERATORS. ASSEMBLY WE ALSO KNOW THAT THE IDENTIFY ROOT CAUSES AND IMPACTS OF THESE ILLNESS. WILL HAVE AN IMPACT ON THOSE RESPONSIBLE ACTORS WITHIN THE LEGAL AND THE ILLICIT MARKET AND WE NEED TO HOLD THEM RESPECTFULLY TO ACCOUNT THAT BEING SAID. WE ARE LOOKING AT WHAT TO DO ON TO PROTECT INDIVIDUALS IN THE MARKET PLACE AND AVERAGE CALIFORNIANS. IT MAY ALSO BE OF CONSIDERATION THAT WE EXPLORE A MORATORIUM ON ADDITIVES WHICH APPEARS TO REFLECT. INDUSTRY'S BEST PRACTICES WE AS A STATE OUR PORT OF ENTRY FOR A LOT OF BEEPING SUPPLIES IT THE UNITED STATES. AND I KNOW THAT WE HAVE AND PARTICULAR IMPORTANT ROLE. YEAH WITH RESPECT TO THE INDUSTRY AS A LARGE STATE AND THE NATION'S SUPPLY CHAIN OF THE ILLICIT MARKET PLACE. IN BOTH CANNABIS AND NICOTINE BEATING PRODUCTS SO I VERY MUCH LOOK FORWARD TO THE TESTIMONY FROM OUR PUBLIC OF REPRESENTATIVES. AND LOOK FOR TO THEN CONTINUED CONVERSATION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH TO. THE CHAIRS HERE AND I THINK A CHAIRMAN GRAY ACTUALLY FRAME THIS DISCUSSION VERY VERY WELL AS A STAR AS A STARTING POINT SO. I JUST WHAT I'LL BE BRIEF I REALLY WANT TO HEAR FROM OUR EXPERTS THIS AFTERNOON. BUT YOU HAVE SOME COMMENTS I THINK THE EXPLOSION OF POPULARITY OF THE CIGARETTES HERE AT THE CIGARETTE USE HAS BEEN A PROBLEM FOR SOME TIME. WAS STAGGERING NUMBERS OF YOUTH BECOMING ADDICTED TO NICOTINE. IN THE LAST SEVERAL WEEKS HAS BECOME ALL TOO CLEAR THAT WE HAVE A MUCH BIGGER PROBLEM ON OUR HANDS WITH THE OUTBREAK. OF LONG ILLNESS AND INJURIES AND DEATH AND THE QUESTIONS AROUND EXACTLY WHAT'S CAUSING THIS. MY COLLEAGUES AND I ARE COMMITTED TO WORKING ON ALL ASPECTS OF THIS ISSUE AND BUYS AS YOU'VE HEARD THIS HEARING IS JUST A FIRST STEP. I BREAK THIS INTO TWO DIFFERENT IN MY MIND THE WAY I LOOK AT THIS AND THERE ARE MANY ASPECTS TO THIS I AM CONCERNED ABOUT ONE. THE NUMBER OF YOUNG PEOPLE THAT ARE STARTING TODAY. PERIOD WHETHER IT'S- NICOTINE OR THC. NUMBER TWO. THE ILLNESS THAT WERE FACING THE PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS THAT WE'RE FACING THERE AND SO I THINK. AS WE START HEARING ABOUT THIS. I THINK THOSE ARE SEPARATE ISSUES IN MANY WAYS THERE IS SOME CROSS OVER BUT- THAT'S HOW MY- MY- WEIRD COMPARTMENTALIZED MIND WORKS. SO WITH THAT I'M HAPPY TO INTRODUCE OUR FIRST PANEL. SO I ASKED HIM TO PLEASE COME UP.% DOCTOR ALISA TONG. AND KIMBERLY BACK TO DORI. WHO WILL GIVE US AN OVERVIEW OF THE VAPING E. CIGARETTE INDUSTRY. AND DISCUSS THE PREVALENCE OF PRODUCTS USE. THANK YOU IN ADVANCE. THANK YOU I THEIR ASSEMBLY MEMBERS MY NAME IS ELISA TONG AND I'M SPEAKING TODAY AS A PRACTICING PHYSICIAN AND TOBACCO RESEARCH EXPERT FOR IDENTIFICATION PURPOSES BOB I WORKED AT UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA DAVIS. TODAY MY SUMMER BACK TO DORI FROM THE CALIFORNIA YOUTH ADVOCACY NETWORK AND I WILL SHARE SOME BRIEF BACKGROUND INFORMATION ABOUT UNDERSTANDING THE NEW VAPING EPIDEMIC FOR CALIFORNIA. THE WORD EPIDEMIC HAS BEEN USED FOR YEARS TO DESCRIBE HOW TOBACCO IS THE LEADING PREVENTABLE CAUSE OF DEATH NOW THE WORD EPIDEMIC IS BEING USED FOR VAPING WITH THE SHARP RISE IN YOUTH RATES THE MASSIVE PROLIFERATION OF PRODUCTS AND SHOCKING NEW CASES OF AVIAN ASSOCIATED PULMONARY INJURY AND DEATHS FIRST I'LL HIGHLIGHT SOME KEY POINTS FOR THE REGULATORY HELP LANDSCAPE NEXT MISS HOMER BACKDOOR WILL HIGHLIGHT THE IMPACT AND- YOUTH. AND YOUNG ADULTS. AT THIS IS WHAT I CALL MY GREATEST HITS LIKE. BUT LOOKING BACK LESSONS FROM THE PAST ABOUT MARKETING AND SCIENCE ARE IMPORTANT FOR UNDERSTANDING WHAT IS GOING ON TODAY. SO IN THE FIFTIES AND SIXTIES WHEN SCIENTIFIC STUDIES THAT FIRST STARTED LINKING SMOKING CIGARETTES TO LUNG CANCER EMERGED THE TOBACCO COMPANIES STARTED RUNNING. THESE HISTORIC ADVERTORIALS CALLED A FRANK STATEMENT TO CIGARETTE SMOKERS TO CREATE DOUBT BY DISPUTING THE STUDY FINDINGS. SAYING EXPERIMENTS WITH MICE WERE NOT REGARDED AS CONCLUSIVE FOR LUNG CANCER THEY ALSO RAN ADS SHOWING DOCTORS HERE PROMOTING PRODUCTS. THEY ALSO STATED THEY BELIEVE THEIR PRODUCTS WERE NOT INJURIOUS TO HEALTH AND THAT THEY WOULD COOPERATE FOR PUBLIC HEALTH. AND THEN GROWING OVER TIME ALL THE SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE TEN YEARS LATER IT TOOK THE FIRST SEARCH LANDMARK CERTAIN GENERAL'S REPORT IN NINETEEN SIXTY FOUR TO SYMPATHIZE ALL THAT BIOLOGICAL. AND DEPUTY A LOGICAL EVIDENCE. CONCLUDING THAT SMOKING DOES INDEED CAUSE LUNG CANCER. SUBSEQUENTLY THE U. S. CONGRESS ADOPTED LAWS FOR HEALTH WARNINGS ON CIGARETTE PACKAGES IN ADVERTISING BANS IN THE BROADCAST MEDIA. HOWEVER TOBACCO CONTROL WORK CONTINUES TODAY AT THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL STATES DUE TO THE QUOTE THE ADDICTIVE NATURE OF TOBACCO. AND POWERFUL ECONOMIC FORCES PROMOTING ITS USE. NOW IN THE SEVENTIES EIGHTIES THE NEXT COUPLE DECADES THE INDUSTRY STARTED TRYING TO DEVELOP AND MARKET NEW PRODUCTS AS LESS HARMFUL TO SMOKERS. BUT IT WAS ACTUALLY THE EVIDENCE THAT NON SMOKERS COULD ALSO BE HARMED THAT HAD THE MOST IMPACT SAMPLES IN THE ROOM MAY NOT HAVE BEEN ALIVE DURING THIS TIME BUT- THAT ADVERTISEMENT ON THE LEFT HAND SIDE WITH THE DISCO LADY. SHOWS THAT THE INDUSTRY SOLD LOW TAR CIGARETTES MILD LIGHT ULTRA LIGHT CIGARETTES ARE LESS HARMFUL BECAUSE WE KNEW THAT TARA CAUSE CANCER WHEN IT WAS PAINTED ON THE BACKS OF MICE MAYBE THIS WAS A WAY TO GET LESS CANCER. HOWEVER THESE CIGARETTES WERE ALSO MACHINE TESTED FOR LOWER LEVELS OF TAR BUT THAT'S NOT REALLY WHAT HAPPENED WHEN PEOPLE ACTUALLY USE THESE PRODUCTS. SO IT DID NOT ACTUALLY REDUCE THE HEALTH RISKS OF SMOKING AND IT TOOK US YEARS TO FIGURE THAT OUT. SO IN REAL LIFE SMOKERS COULD CHANGE THE WAY THEY SMOKE BECAUSE THEY WERE TRYING TO GET A LOT MORE NICOTINE AND THEY COULD ACTUALLY GET THE SAME AMOUNT OF CHEMICALS OR EVEN MORE. THAN THE MACHINE BASED NUMBER SUGGESTED. SO AS- TIME WENT ON IN THE MID NINETEEN EIGHTIES THE SURGEON GENERAL CAME OUT WITH A REPORT ON. THE GROWING AGAIN THE GROWING SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE THAT SECONDHAND SMOKE EXPOSURE CAUSED HARM TO NONSMOKERS AND IN FACT BECAUSE LIKE CANCER. THIS EVIDENCE HELP STIMULATE ABROAD RATE OF CHANGE FROM. SOME OF YOU IN THE ROOM MAY REMEMBER NO SMOKING SECTIONS WHICH PEOPLE JOKINGLY SAY IT'S LIKE HAVING A NO PEEING SECTION IN A POOL. BECAUSE IT DOESN'T REALLY WORK. TO NOW WHAT WE HAVE FOR SMOKE FREE POLICIES THAT PROTECT NONSMOKERS SO. IN CALIFORNIA WE ARE VERY FORTUNATE THAT NINETEEN NINETY NINE WITH OUR FOR OUR FIRST TOBACCO TAXED. THAT WE CREATED A COMPREHENSIVE TOBACCO CONTROL PROGRAM TO CHANGE SOCIAL NORMS AROUND SMOKING. REDUCE PRODUCT AVAILABILITY AND PROTECT PUBLIC HEALTH. INSTEAD OF ONLY FOCUSING ON TREATING INDIVIDUAL SMOKERS ON THIS APPROACH HAS BEEN WIDELY RECOGNIZED INTERNATIONALLY. AS ONE OF THE GREATEST PUBLIC HEALTH SUCCESS IS TO THIS DAY. NOW THE NINETIES TO THE TWO THOUSAND WERE MARKED BY LAWSUITS. UP WHISTLE BLOWERS HELPED BRING INTERNAL TOBACCO INDUSTRY DOCUMENTS TO LIGHT THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY PROTECTED THROUGH ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE. THESE INTERNAL DOCUMENTS DOCUMENTS WHEN STARK CONTRAST TO THE PICTURE IN THE UPPER RIGHT OF WHERE THE TOBACCO INDUSTRY CEOS AT THE TIME TESTIFIED IN FRONT OF CONGRESS I BELIEVE NICOTINE IS NOT ADDICTIVE. SUBSEQUENTLY THE STATE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S UP SUIT FOR MEDICAID COSTS FOR TOBACCO RELATED DISEASE LEADING TO WHAT IS CALLED AS THE MASTER SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT. AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL IN TWO THOUSAND SIX THE US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE RULED THAT THE INDUSTRY VIOLATED THE RACKETEERING AND CORRUPT INFLUENCE ORGANIZATIONS LAW CONCLUDING THAT INDUSTRY QUOTE. CONTINUES TO ENGAGE IN AND EXECUTE A FIFTY YEAR SCHEME TO DEFRAUD THE PUBLIC ON HEALTH EFFECTS AND MARKETING TO CHILDREN. AND THEN FOR YEARS AFTERWARDS THE INDUSTRY ARGUED AGAINST FEDERAL PENALTIES AND IT TOOK OVER A DECADE LATER IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEENTH FOR THEM TO FINALLY ERIC QUOTE. OF CONSTRUCTIVE COURT ORDERED STATEMENTS WHICH SOME OF WHICH ARE SEEN ON THE LOWER RIGHT. AND SO THESE RAN KIND OF IN LIKE MIKE TV'S BLACK AND WHITE THERE'S YOU CAN STILL SEE SOME OF THEM ON YOUTUBE. HOWEVER STUDY SHOWED THAT ONLY 40% OF US. ADULTS WERE ACTUALLY AWARE OF THESE CORRECTIVE STATEMENTS ABOUT THE RANGE OF WHAT THEY HAD THE STATE INCLUDED IT KNOWLEDGE MENTION THAT. NICOTINE WAS INDEED ADDICTIVE LOW TAR LIGHT ULTRALIGHT MILE THE NATURAL CIGARETTES ACTUALLY LACKED HEALTH BENEFITS AND WERE DECEPTIVELY MARKETED AS LESS HARMFUL. THE CIGARETTES FROM MANIPULATED TO MAXIMIZE NICOTINE DELIVERY. AND THAT THERE IS NO SAFE LEVEL OF EXPOSURE TO SECONDHAND SMOKE. SO NOW WE COME TO THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION IN TWO THOUSAND NINE THEY WERE GIVEN AUTHORITY TO REGULATE TOBACCO PRODUCTS. THIS INCLUDED THE MANUFACTURE DISTRIBUTION AND MARKETING OF TOBACCO PRODUCTS. THE FDA IS SUPPOSED TO APPROVE THAT NEW PRODUCTS ARE NOT WORSE THAN CIGARETTES BEFORE THEY GO TO MARKET. THERE ALSO SUPPOSED TO APPROVE ANY MARK PRODUCTS MAKING CESSATION OR REDUCED HARM CLAIMS. ARE GO THROUGH THEIR OFFICE AS WELL AND PRODUCTS LIKE JEWEL HAVE NOT DONE FOR EXAMPLE. FLAVORS AND CIGARETTES HAVE ALREADY BEEN BANNED THROUGH THIS REGULATION EXCEPT FOR MENTAL CIGARETTES DUE TO INDUSTRY PRESSURE. HOWEVER THIS LED TO THE RISE OF NEW PRODUCTS THAT WERE NOT QUOTE CIGARETTES SOME YOU CAN SEE ON THE FAR UPPER RIGHT THAT DID NOT HAVE TO FOLLOW RULES MADE FOR CIGARETTES. UP WITH THE BROWN PAPER WRAPPING. YOU COULD SUDDENLY HAVE A CIGARETTE YOU OR LITTLE CIGAR AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO FOLLOW THE FLAVOR PACKAGING RULES THAT WERE MADE FOR CIGARETTES. ELECTRONIC CIGARETTES FROM THE RISE AS WELL BUT IT TOOK YEARS FOR THE FDA TO FINALIZE WHAT'S CALLED THE QUOTE DEEMING ROLL. UP TO BEGIN REGULATION THAT WAS IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN AND THE FDA DELAYED IMPLEMENTATION OF THAT FOR. UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY TWO FOR MANUFACTURERS TO SUBMIT INFORMATION AND IMPROVE THEIR PRODUCTS BUT NOW WITH PUBLIC PRESSURE AS YOU ALL MAY WELL KNOW. THIS HAS BEEN MOVED UP TO NEXT YEAR. THIS COMPLICATED BUT LET ME WALK YOU THROUGH THIS THROUGHOUT THE YEARS CALIFORNIA SUCCESS STORY IS THAT CIGARETTE SMOKING PREVALENCE RATES HAVE DECLINED FASTER THAN THE REST OF THE COUNTRY. BUT THE NEWS NOW IS THAT BEEPING AND MARIJUANA USE RATES. ARE RISING ESPECIALLY IN YOUNG ADULTS. SO THIS DATA FOCUSES ON THE GENERAL ADULT POPULATION IT'S MISS SUMMER BAGUETTE OR HE'S GOING TO DESCRIBE YOUTH AND YOUNG ADULTS. SINCE CALIFORNIA HAS A TOBACCO TWENTY ONE LAW NOT TO SELL TO PERSONS UNDER TWENTY ONE. SO THE BAR CHART SHOWS ON THE FAR RIGHT THAT IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN ARE CALIFORNIA PROBLEMS FOR ANY TOBACCO USE. WAS ALMOST FIFTEEN PERCENT. ON THE FAR LEFT YOU'LL SEE CIGARETTES THAT'S TEN PERCENT. AND ONLY 3% FOR BEEPING THAT LITTLE BAR THE SECOND BAR FROM THE LEFT. HOWEVER AT YOUNGER PEOPLE WHO ARE AGE TWENTY ONE TO TWENTY NINE YEARS OLD THEY BAIT THAT MUCH HIGHER RATES WITH 11% IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN AND 13% AND- TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN. AND USERS MAY USE OUR SWITCH ACROSS MULTIPLE TOBACCO PRODUCTS. AND IN THE U. S. OVER HALF OF THE CIGARETTE USERS ARE CURRENT SMOKERS. MARIJUANA USE ON THE- RIGHT IN ADULTS ESPECIALLY YOUNG PEOPLE IS ALSO RISING. WITH OVER ONE AND FOR YOUNG ADULTS OVER TWENTY ONE. SIMILARLY CO USE OF MARIJUANA AND TOBACCO IS RISING NOW WITH ONE EIGHT YOUNG ADULTS OVER TWENTY ONE. SO WHAT THE SLOW FEDERAL REGULATORY LANDSCAPE FOR VAPING IT'S DIFFICULT TO KNOW WHAT'S ACTUALLY IN THESE THE CIGARETTE PRODUCTS AND THEIR AIR ASSAULT AT DESPITE WHAT THEY'RE LABELED HOUSE THIS IS A GRAPHIC FROM THE CDC WHERE THEY NOTE THAT PRODUCTS THAT ARE MARKETED AS EVEN HAVING NO NICOTINE. HAVE BEEN FOUND TO CONTAIN NICOTINE SO STUDIES TO DATE SHOW THAT THIS AEROSOL IS NOT WATER VAPOR WHICH IS WHAT MANY PEOPLE THINK AND THE PUBLIC INSTEAD THIS AEROSOL AS A CHEMICAL MIXTURE THAT CAN CONTAIN PROPYLENE GLYCOL VOLATILE ORGANIC COMPOUNDS CARCINOGENS HEAVY METALS FLAVORS. AND CULTURE FINE PARTICLES ULTRA FINE PARTICLES FOR EXAMPLE CAN ARE JUST SOME OF THE SUBSTANCES THAT CAN HAVE IMMEDIATE HARMFUL EFFECTS SO ALL OF US WHO EXPERIENCE THE CALIFORNIA SMOKY FIRES FOR EXAMPLE OR FREEWAY AIR POLLUTION. THERE THOSE THINGS ARE ALL OF THE ULTRA FINE PARTICLES ARE KNOWN TO CAUSE INFLAMMATION THAT'S IMPORTANT FOR HEART AND LUNG FUNCTION IN PARTICULAR. EVEN IF SOME PRODUCTS CONTAIN LESS OF THESE HARMFUL INGREDIENTS THE CDC HAS UNDERSCORED. THIS DOES NOT MEAN IT IS A SAFE PRODUCT. THERE ISN'T IN FACT NO SAFE TOBACCO PRODUCT WE ALREADY LEARNED THAT LOW TAR CIGARETTES AS DEFINED BY MACHINE DOESN'T MEAN IT'S A SAFER PRODUCT WE ARE STILL LEARNING HOW HEATING AND INHALING CHEMICALS IN THESE PRODUCTS. AFFECT THE HUMAN BODY. SO DESPITE HAVING BEEN BANNED IN CIGARETTES FLAVORS AND THEIR MARKETING OF FLAVORED TOBACCO PRODUCTS ARE CONCERNING FOR THE RISE AND USE AND THEY'RE HARMFUL HEALTH EFFECTS. SO JUST A COUPLE EXAMPLES HERE SOME MENTHOL. HAS BEEN MOST NOTABLY BEEN TARGETED TOWARDS THE AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY. ARE CONTRIBUTING TO A TOBACCO RELATED HEALTH DISPARITIES. JOHN BEING JUST A FLAVOR PREFERENCE THE GROWING EVIDENCE ABOUT MENTHOL IS THAT ITS NUMBING PROPERTIES MAKE IT EASIER EASIER TO AND INITIATE AND HAIL. ITS CHEMICAL PROPERTIES MAKE IT HARDER TO QUIT BECAUSE IT'S ACTUALLY WORKING ON THE NICOTINE RECEPTORS AND IT AND THERE'S AN ASSOCIATE A CARCINOGEN WITH THESE OILS COUPLE GUNS AND THERE THERE'S A RECENT JAM ARTICLE THAT SAYS. THERE ARE LEVELS THAT ARE HIGHER WAY HIRING E. CIGARETTES THAT ACTUALLY WHAT'S IN REGULAR CIGARETTES OR ALSO FTA LEVELS FOR FOOD AND IT'S BEEN BANNED AS A FOOD ADDITIVE AS A SYNTHETIC. CHEMICAL. OTHER FLAVORS THAT ARE APPEALING TO CHILDREN INCLUDE FRUIT CANDY OR SWEET FLAVORS THAT HAS BEEN NOTED. BUT THESE HAVE SAFETY STANDARDS THAT ARE MEANT FOR EATING NOT FOR AN HAILING. GROWING EVIDENCE SHOWS THAT THESE FLAVORS BY THEMSELVES AND IN COMBINATION CAN HARM HEALTH. SUCH AS WITH LUNG FUNCTION BLOOD VESSEL CELLS AND WHITE BLOOD CELLS WHICH IS IMPORTANT FOR AT YOUR- IMMUNITY. I ALSO FEEL WHICH IS FOUND IN THREE QUARTERS OF E. LIQUIDS IS ASSOCIATED WITH BRONCHIOLITIS OBLITERANS AN IRREVERSIBLE LUNG DISEASE DESCRIBE AND WORKERS FROM BUTTER POPCORN FACTOR FACTORIES. SO THE HIGH POTENCY OF NICOTINE. LEVELS AND MARIJUANA'S PSYCHOACTIVE COMPONENT THC AND THESE BACKING PRODUCTS IS REALLY ALARMING. IMPACT THE SURGEON GENERAL HAS RELEASED WARNINGS TO YOUNG ADULTS FOR BOTH OF THESE COMPONENTS BECAUSE THE DEVELOPING BRAIN IS ESPECIALLY VULNERABLE THROUGH AGE TWENTY FIVE. NICOTINE ITSELF IS NOT HARMLESS WITH POTENTIAL FOR CARDIOVASCULAR EFFECTS BOB SEIZURES AND EVEN POISONINGS IT'S USED IN PESTICIDES. WITH BABY NEW NICOTINE SALTS AND LIQUIDS HAVE HIGH BIO AVAILABILITY AND ARE MORE EASILY ABSORBED WITH LESS AEROSOL THAN REGULAR CIGARETTES AND REGULAR CIGARETTES. THE INDUSTRY HAD USED AMMONIA TO BASICALLY FREE BASE HIGHER LEVELS OF NICOTINE I'M TO BE ABSORBED IN YOUR BODY. IN FACT THAT DIAGRAM ON THE RIGHT IT SURE IS FROM THE CDC AND IT SHOWS ONE SMALL JEWEL POD AT E. JUICE CONTAINS AT LEAST AS MUCH NICOTINE AS ONE PACK OF CIGARETTES BUT AGAIN AS NOTED IN MAYBE EVEN HIGHER DEPENDING ON HOW YOU USE IT. NEWER PRODUCTS. AT THAT YOU HAVE EVEN HIGHER E. LIQUID CONCENTRATIONS OF NICOTINE MAYBE FROM REFILLABLE. AND AS MORE PEOPLE BAIT MARIJUANA THE SURGEON GENERAL HAS PUT OUT A WARNING THAT THC CONCENTRATIONS OF INCREASED THREE FOLD OVER THE PAST COUPLE DECADES. SO THIS HEALTH EFFECTS OF VAPING THESE HIGH POTENCY NICOTINE AND MARIJUANA PRODUCTS. INCLUDING IN COMBINATION AND HOW HEATING MIGHT BE DIFFERENT THAN BURNING. THIS IS ALL LEARNING FOR EVERYONE AND PUTTING THE MEDICAL PROFESSION AND THIS IS AN ONGOING NATURAL EXPERIMENT IN HUMANS. SO AND AS MENTIONED NOW THIS PAST SUMMER WITH THE VAPING ASSOCIATED PULMONARY INJURY ALL THIS COMBINATION OF ON THE RISE IN VAPING NICOTINE AND MARIJUANA. AT HAS BROUGHT US TO THIS STATE UP SO EVERY WEEK THE CBC'S REPORTING MORE CASES SO AS MENTIONED EARLIER UP THIRTEEN HUNDRED CASES OVER A HUNDRED. CASES IN CALIFORNIA TWENTY SIX DEATHS INCLUDING THREE IN CALIFORNIA KING COUNTY TULARE COUNTY IN LA COUNTY. AND THIS ISN'T JUST A YOUTH PROBLEM BECAUSE THE MEDIAN AGE OF DEATH IS FORTY NINE YEARS OLD AND THE RANGE IS SEVENTEEN TO SOMEBODY FIVE. AND AGAIN THE CDC STATES NO SINGLE PRODUCT OR SUBSTANCE HAS BEEN LINKED TO ALL CASES ALTHOUGH MOST REPORTED BEEPING TEACH SEE A IT'S ONLY ABOUT A THIRD EXCLUSIVELY. AND WELL OVER HALF REPORTED BEEPING NICOTINE SO THE CDC HAVE COME OUT TO SAY TO THE PUBLIC PEOPLE SHOULD NOT USE VAPING PRODUCTS WITH THC CONSIDER THAT AS WELL FOR NICOTINE PRODUCTS ALSO. OTHER RECOMMENDATIONS ARE NOT TO BUY BEEPING PRODUCTS OFF THE STREET OR MODIFY OR ADD SUBSTANCES HOWEVER MANY PEOPLE GET THEIR PRODUCTS SOCIALLY FROM OTHERS SO IT'S HARD TO TELL. REGARDLESS OF THE INVESTIGATION THE CDC EMPHASIZES THAT YOUNG PEOPLE PREGNANT WOMEN AND NEVER USERS SHOULD NOT VAPE THERE IS NO SAFE TOBACCO PRODUCT USE AND T. H. C. IS ASSOCIATED WITH A WIDE RANGE OF HEALTH EFFECTS ESPECIALLY AMONGST HEAVY USERS. AND WE'RE STILL LEARNING ABOUT THAT. ON TO THE STATE. IT'S WORTH NOTING ALSO THAT SECONDHAND SMOKE EXPOSURE NONSMOKERS HAS BECOME. THAT INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT ISSUE SO THE CDC IMAGE ON THE LEFT DESCRIBES HOW THE SURGEON GENERAL HAS CONCLUDED THAT AEROSOL FROM PEIPING CAN CONTAIN HARMFUL SUBSTANCES. AND USE IN PUBLIC PLACES UNDERMINES EXISTING PROTECTIONS FOR NON USERS. BACK IN TWO THOUSAND SIX THERE IS A CERTAIN GENERAL'S REPORT THAT CONCLUDED THERE IS NO RISK FREE LEVEL OF EXPOSURE TO SECONDHAND SMOKE AND NON USERS. THIS IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT FOR HEART AND LUNG HEALTH. AND ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE IS THE IMAGE FROM CALIFORNIA'S A TOBACCO CONTROL PROGRAMS NEW SECONDHAND DANGERS CAMPAIGN. THEM WHERE THEY DESCRIBE OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS SECONDHAND MARIJUANA EXPOSURE THINKING INCREASED BY INCREASED. BY 67% AND IT'S WORTH NOTING ALSO THAT 30% OF CALIFORNIA YOUTH IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN ALSO REPORT EXPOSURE TO SECONDHAND SMOKE. VAPOR AND MARIJUANA SO THE SMOKE AND TOBACCO FREE POLICIES THAT PROTECT PUBLIC HEALTH NOW NEED TO CONSIDER VAPING INCLUDING MARIJUANA. SO WRAPPING UP SMOKING CESSATION HAS A STRONG EVIDENCE BASE THAT IT WORKS COUNSELING SUPPORT AND MEDICATIONS CAN HELP PEOPLE QUIT FOR GOOD. HOWEVER IT'S BECAUSE OF THE HIGHLY ADDICTIVE NATURE OF NICOTINE IT CAN TAKE AT LEAST EIGHT TO TWELVE REALLY GOOD AT TIMES FOR SOMEONE TO QUIT FOR GOOD. AND PROVIDERS ARE TOLD THEY SHOULD ASK ABOUT TOBACCO USE EXPOSURE ADVISED TO QUIT AND ADVISE ABOUT HEALTH HARMS. AND REFER TO COUNSELING SUPPORT AN OFFER MEDICATIONS WE ARE STILL TRYING TO LEARN WHAT TO DO ABOUT THE THING. IT'S NOT EVEN A REQUIREMENT FOR US TO ASK ABOUT THE THING. BUT OUR STATE QUITE LINE NOW THE CALIFORNIA SMOKERS HELPLINE AT UC SAN DIEGO THEY HAVE NOW STEPPED UP AS OUR FREE STATEWIDE RESOURCE TO HELP NOT ONLY. HELP PEOPLE QUIT SMOKING BUT ALSO WITH A BANG AND THIS INCLUDES FOR TEENS. THERE ARE SEVEN FDA APPROVED TOBACCO CESSATION AIDS TO ASSIST WITH NICOTINE WITHDRAWAL SYMPTOMS OVER TWO TO THREE MONTHS AND MOST PEOPLE ARE FAMILIAR WITH THE NICOTINE PATCH LAWCENTER Gí FASTER ACTING MODALITIES LIKE THE NASAL SPRAY IN AN INHALER NONE OF WHICH ARE MEANT TO GO INTO YOUR LUNGS. THIS IS LIKE THE BACK OF YOUR THROAT AND SHE'D ABSORPTION. AND NONE OF THESE ARE MEANT TO BE FOR LONG TERM EITHER. SO IN THE U. S. U. CIGARETTES ARE NOT APPROVED AS A SMOKING CESSATION AID AS CONCLUDED BY THE U. S. PREVENTIVE SERVICES TASK FORCE WHICH REVIEWS ALL THE SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE. BUT NOW ARE HEALTH SYSTEMS AND PROVIDERS ARE NOW CHALLENGED UP WITH FIGURING OUT HOW TO ASK ADVISE AND TREAT. PEOPLE WHO BAKED AND TO HELP PEOPLE QUIT BAKING FOR GOOD. SO WITH THAT I'LL TRANSITION TO. SUMMER BY THE DORY. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY MY NAME IS KIM HOMER BAGUETTE OR AND I'M WITH AN ORGANIZATION THAT WORKS STATEWIDE ON TOBACCO CONTROL ISSUES WITH YOUTH AND YOUNG ADULTS AND WE ALSO WORK WITH ALL OF OUR COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES IN THE STATE ON SMOKING TOBACCO FREE POLICY INITIATIVES TODAY I'M GOING TO HIGHLIGHT AND SUMMARIES FOR YOU THE NATIONAL AND STATE DATA WE HAVE ON YOUTH AND YOUNG ADULT USE. I DO WANT TO NOTE THAT THIS IS TOBACCO HAVE YOU BECAUSE THAT'S MY AREA OF EXPERTISE BUT IT'S ALSO WHAT WE HAVE A LOT OF RESEARCH ON. SO LOOKING AT CURRENT USE WE NOW AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL THAT WE SAW OUR PEAK. IN U. FATE BEING IN TWENTY FIFTEEN AND WE STARTED TO GO DOWN. IN TWENTY SIXTEEN WITH A SLIGHT UPTICK IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN. MUCH OF THIS IS DUE TO THE TYPES OF DEVICES THAT WERE AVAILABLE ON THE MARKET. PRIOR TO THE NEW DEVICES THAT WE HAVE WE LIKE TO SAY THERE ARE THREE TYPES OF PRODUCTS. WEEK SICK LIKE SIR THE FIRST THEY LOOK JUST LIKE LITTLE CIGARETTES. THE SECOND ARE THE V. PENS WHICH NOW WE'RE HEARING FROM YOUNG PEOPLE ARE REALLY ONLY BEING USED AS WAX PENS TO BE. TEACH SHE SOLUTIONS. AND THEN THE THIRD FOR THE MONTH AND THE TANKS. AND PART OF THE CHALLENGES WITH THESE PRODUCTS WERE THEY WERE NOT VERY GOOD AT DELIVERING NICOTINE SUSPICION. AND SO INDIVIDUALS ARE NOT GETTING SATIATED WHEN USING THEM IN TRYING TO. USE THEM OTHER THAN. OTHER TOBACCO PRODUCTS. TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE ALL CHANGED WITH THE INTRODUCTION OF THE NEW POD BASED PRODUCTS. THERE ARE TWO THINGS THAT CHANGE WITH THESE PRODUCTS THE FIRST WAS THE SIZE OF THE DEVICE WHICH IS VERY PROBLEMATIC FOR YOUNG PEOPLE BECAUSE THEY'RE EASY TO HIDE. AND BECAUSE ARE ALSO SMALLER THE BATTERIES ARE SMALLER THERE'S LESS AEROSOL THAT IS OMITTED FROM THEM AND SO THERE IS. VERY VERY DIFFICULT TO TAX. THE SECOND WAS THE TYPE OF SOLUTIONS THAT'S IN THESE PRODUCTS SO IT'S A NICOTINE SALT SOLUTION IT'S EASIER TO CONSUME AND SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER AND NICOTINE SOLUTIONS. THAN THE OTHER PRODUCTS BEFORE THESE. THESE ARE THE PRODUCTS THAT YOUNG PEOPLE HAVE BEEN USING IN THESE ARE THE PRODUCTS THAT ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS EPIDEMIC THAT WE ARE NOW RECOGNIZING AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL. SO WITHIN A ONE YEAR PERIOD. WE SAW AN INCREASE OF ONE AND A HALF MILLION STUDENTS USE STUDENTS. WHO INCREASE THEIR USE OF THESE PRODUCTS WITH FREE SHIPPING. AND THE GREATEST INCREASE WAS SEEN AMONG HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS. I'M LOOKING AT THE RECENT DATA THAT WAS RELEASED FROM THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT. THIS IS PRELIMINARY DATA AND MORE WILL BE COMING SOON BUT IT'S SHOWING THAT WE ARE CONTINUING TO SEE AN INCREASE IN THE FADING OF TOBACCO PRODUCTS. AND SO IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN WHEN THE ALARMS WENT OFF WE SIGN INCREASE UP TO ALMOST 21% THAT HAS JUMPED AGAINST NEARLY 28% AND THIS IS PASTA THIRTY DAY YOU SAID THIS IS NOT EVER USE THIS IS. REGULAR THIRTY DAY USE. WHAT'S ALSO TROUBLING IS THE TYPES OF PRODUCTS THAT YOUNG PEOPLE ARE USING SO WE KNOW IN TWENTY SIXTEEN THERE OVER FIFTEEN THOUSAND UNIQUE FLAVORS OF EVEN DEVICES ON THE MARKET. AND WE KNOW THAT YOUNG PEOPLE WERE MOST LIKELY TO USE CANDY FLAVORED OR FRUIT FLAVORED. BUT IN TWENTY NINETEEN WE SEEN A JUMP OF YOUNG PEOPLE USING MINTS AND THEN SLATED PRODUCTS. SO WE HAVE A LOT TO CELEBRATE WITH OUR CIGARETTE SMOKING WE'VE DONE SOME PHENOMENAL GROUP WORK TO GET US DOWN 22% AT THE HISTORIC LOW. BUT THAT IS NOT THE SAME WITH ALL TOBACCO PRODUCTS AND SO SPECIFICALLY LOOKING IN CALIFORNIA. THE DATE IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN WHICH WE SAW AS MUCH AS TIME WE'RE DEALING WITH RIGHT NOW. DATA A YEAR AGO CAN BE ARCHAIC WHEN WE'RE DEALING WITH THIS PROBLEM. BUT WHAT WE HAVE IS NEARLY 11% OF TEENS REPORTED TO PASS THIRTY DAY USE OF VAPING DEVICES. AND YOU CAN SEE WITH THE YELLOW IN THIS CHART THE MAJORITY OF THE PRODUCTS THAT ARE BEING USED REGARDLESS OF ITS VAPING OR ANOTHER TOBACCO PRODUCT. IS A FLAVORED. PRODUCT. I'M DATA FROM THE CALIFORNIA STUDENT TOBACCO SURVEY ALSO SHOWS THAT YOU USE OF MARIJUANA IS HIGH. SO THERE WAS NOT ANY SIGNIFICANT CHANGES FROM TWENTY SIXTEEN TO TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND USE BUT IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT MARIJUANA USE AMONG TEENS IS STILL HIGHER THAN TOBACCO USE. AND ALSO HIGHER THAN E. CIGARETTE USE. I'M THE SURVEYS THAT THE QUESTIONS THAT WERE ASKED ON THE SURVEY ASK STUDENTS WHO REPORTED VAPING WHAT TYPES OF PRODUCTS A. B. TEN THEY DID ASK OF THE BATES TEACH SEE SOLUTION. AND 21% CLOSE 222% OF TEENS DID REPORT VAPING TEACH SHE PRODUCTS IN CALIFORNIA. NOW LOOKING AT YOUNG ADULTS WE SEE A SIMILAR TREND AND THAT CIGARETTE SMOKING IS GOING DOWN. THE CIGARETTE USE IS GOING UP AND MARIJUANA USE HAS GONE UP SIGNIFICANTLY. I'M WE AGAIN I HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN TRYING TO REDUCE COMBUSTIBLE PRODUCTS BUT THE SAME CAN'T BE SAID FOR BEEPING DEVICES. WHAT'S INTERESTING AND I'VE BEEN WORKING WITH COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES FOR OVER EIGHTEEN YEARS. IS IT FOR A LONG TIME WE'VE BEEN SEEING THE USE OF TOBACCO USE RATES GO DOWN WITH COLLEGE STUDENTS SO WE CAN PREDICT THAT IF SOMEBODY DOES NOT GO TO COLLEGE. THAT THEIR LIKELIHOOD OF SMOKING CIGARETTES HIGHER THAN SOMEBODY WHO IS IN COLLEGE. NOW THAT HAS BEEN COMPLETELY REVERSED BY THIS TREND BEEPING. AND SO COLLEGE STUDENTS NOW HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER RATES OF BEEPING NICOTINE SOLUTIONS AND VAPING MARIJUANA PRODUCTS THAN INDIVIDUALS WHO DO NOT GO TO COLLEGE. ONE CHALLENGE WITH THIS SPECIFICALLY IN TWO AS OUR COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES MANY IN CALIFORNIA WHICH ARE NOW SMOKING TOBACCO FREE. HAVE AN INFLUX OF STUDENTS WHO ARE ADDICTED TO THESE PRODUCTS WE'RE NOW GOING TO THEIR CAMPUSES. AND ARE IN NEED OF SUPPORT TO HELP THEM QUIT. AND THEY'RE GOING TO SMOKING TOBACCO FREE CAMPUSES BUT OUR K. THROUGH TWELVE CAMPUSES ARE SMOKING TOBACCO FREE IN YOUNG PEOPLE ARE STILL USING THESE PRODUCTS. SO WHEN WE LOOK AT LITERATURE SPECIFIC TO WHY YOUNG PEOPLE USE TOBACCO PRODUCTS AND SPECIFICALLY VAPE. WE HAVE EVIDENCE THAT SHOWS THAT YOUNG PEOPLE OF IT BECAUSE IT'S THEIR NORM SERVE THEIR FRIENDS ARE USING THESE PRODUCTS OR THEY HAVE FAMILY MEMBERS WHO USE THEM THEY'RE MORE LIKELY TO USE THEM. WHAT'S INTERESTING IS IF YOU TALK TO A YOUNG PERSON IF YOU TALK TO COLLEGE STUDENTS TO USE THEIR PERCEPTION OF WHAT THE USE IS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN WHAT IT ACTUALLY IS. AND SO THAT MAKES THEM BELIEVE THAT IT'S COMPLETELY NORMALIZED TO USE THESE PRODUCTS WHAT'S INTERESTING MANY OF THE YOUNG PEOPLE THAT WE WORK WITH HAVE NOT BEEN EXPOSED TO SECONDHAND SMOKE INDOORS THEY'VE GROWN UP IN A SMOKE FREE CALIFORNIANS THE NORM OF CIGARETTE SMOKING. IS NOT THERE. WE'VE COMPLETELY REVERSED THAT WITH KEEPING BECAUSE YOUNG PEOPLE ARE SAYING AT AND THEY THINK EVERYBODY DOES IF YOU EVER TALK TO EIGHTEEN YOU ASK THEM HOW. DO YOU KNOW PEOPLE THAT BE IF THEY SAY YES EVERYBODY IS VAPING. I'M ALSO WITH FLAVORS SO FLAVORS WAS A HIGH INDICATOR OF WHY PEOPLE ARE USING THESE PRODUCTS TO EXPERIMENT WITH FLAVOURS. AND IT WHEN WE ASKED WE DO FOCUS GROUPS OF YOUNG PEOPLE AND WE ASKED THEM ABOUT THE PRODUCTS THAT THEY USE. AND ALL OF THE YOUNG PEOPLE WE TALKED TO SAY THEY USE PRODUCTS BECAUSE OF THE FLAVORS AND THEY TASTE GOOD. AND FLAVORS IN THE VAPING DEVICES WERE AWESOME COMBUSTIBLE PRODUCTS AT MASS THE HARSHNESS OF. THE SMOKE AND IT MAKES THEM BELIEVE THAT IT'S NOT AS BAD. WE'VE HAD AND FLAVORED CIGARETTE PRODUCTS SINCE TWO THOUSAND NINE WITH THE EXCEPTION OF MONTHLY THE PRODUCT. AND SO THERE'S A LOT OF MISPERCEPTIONS ROUND THE HARMS OF MANY OF THESE PRODUCTS. AND E. CIGARETTES ARE ALSO INCLUDED IN THAT. IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW AS WELL THAT WHEN WE DID OUR FOCUS GROUPS WITH YOU OF WHAT WE TALK PRIMARILY ABOUT TOBACCO. THE CONVERSATION WE HAVE THE IN PERSON WRAPS BACK INTO MARIJUANA. AND WHILE YOUNG PEOPLE HAVE MIXED FEELINGS ON THE SAFETY OF E. CIGARETTES THE MAJORITY OFYOUNG PEOPLE WE TALKED TO BELIEVE THAT MARIJUANA WAS COMPLETELY SAFE. SO ANOTHER REASON FOR THIS IS THE ACCESS TO TOBACCO PRODUCTS. SO WHEN JULIA STARTED TO BECOME POPULAR IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN TWENTY EIGHTEEN. THE TRUTH INITIATIVE THAT NATIONAL STUDY SPECIFIC TO INDIVIDUALS WHO HAD REPORTED TOOL USE TO FIND OUT WHERE THEY WERE READING THESE PRODUCTS AND AS YOU CAN SEE THE MAJORITY OF YOUNG PEOPLE REPORTED THAT THEY WERE GETTING THEM IN THE RETAIL ENVIRONMENT. AND GETTING THEM LOCALLY. AND SO WHEN WE LOOK HERE IN CALIFORNIA OUR BIGGEST OFFENDERS OF RETAILERS ARE SELLING TOBACCO PRODUCTS ARE ACTUALLY THE TOBACCO IN THE SHOPS WHERE YOUNG PEOPLE ARE NOT ALLOWED IN. AND YET THEY ARE SELLING AT RATES HIGHER THAN. LEVELS OF ANY OTHER RETAILER. SO SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT WE HAVE. FOR AN ORGANIZATION THAT WORKS WITH YOUNG PEOPLE. THE FIRST IS WE HAVE EXTENSIVE DATA TO SHOW THAT YOUNG PEOPLE WHO EXPERIMENT WITH VAPING OR YOUNG PEOPLE WHO DO VAPE. ARE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE LIKELY TO BECOME TOBACCO USERS USE A COMBUSTIBLE PRODUCTS THAT THEY HAVE NOT BEEN USING BUT STIL WILL START USING. OR USE MARIJUANA PRODUCTS. WE ALSO KNOW THAT THE YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE LEAVING TODAY WOULD NOT HAVE CONSIDERED SMOKING A CIGARETTE. THEY WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN AT HIGH RISK FOR TOBACCO USE AND NOW THEY ARE BECAUSE OF THEIR BEEPING BEHAVIOR. WE ALSO KNOW THAT YOU CIGARETTE RATES ARE CONTINUING TO GROW. AND USE OF COMBUSTIBLE CIGARETTES IS DECREASING OR STAYING THE SAME IN SOME POPULATIONS. IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO KNOW AS DOCTORS HUNG IT SAID THAT THE LAW THE PRODUCTS THAT YOUNG PEOPLE ARE USING TODAY HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER LEVELS. OF NICOTINE THAN THE PRODUCTS OF THE PAST WHAT'S HARD ABOUT THESE PRODUCTS WE DON'T KNOW WHAT YOUNG PEOPLE ARE USING. SO I'M LIKE A CIGARETTE THAT YOU WOULD BUY YOU WOULD SMOKE IT AND THEN IT WOULD BE EXTINGUISHED AND WOULD BE DONE THESE PRODUCTS ARE USED AND SH STUDENTS ARE SHARING THEM. WHEN WE TALK TO TEENS ABOUT THEIR USE AND WE ASKED THEM IF THEY ON THE PRODUCTS THEY SAY NO WHAT HAPPENS IS THEY LEAVE CLASS THEIR FRIEND DOES A PUFF PUFF AND THEN PASSES THE PRODUCT TO THEM. AND THEN THEY PUFF PUFF AND PASS IT BACK AND SO THEY ARE SHARING DEVICES AND SHARING DIFFERENT SOLUTIONS AND OFTEN TIMES THEY HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY BEEPING. WHAT'S ALSO INTERESTING IS IN NINETEEN NINETY AFTER THE MASTER SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT WAS SIGNED WE SAW A CHANGE IN FACT THESE BEHAVIOR AMONG YOUNG PEOPLE WHERE YOUNG PEOPLE WOULD EXPERIMENT WITH TOBACCO BEFORE THE AGE OF EIGHTEEN AND IF THEY BECAME ADDICTED THEY WOULD DO SO IN THEIR YOUNG ADULT YEARS. AND THAT HAS SHIFTED IN MY TIME IN TOBACCO CONTROL THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THAT WE HAVE YOUNG ADULTS OR YOUTH THAT ARE ACTUALLY SELF IDENTIFYING AS BEING ADDICTED TO TOBACCO AND SEEKING HELP IN QUITTING. AND WE'RE TRYING DESPERATELY TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET THEM THAT HELP. OFTENTIMES THEY MAY NOT BE READY TO QUIT BUT AT LEAST MOTIVATING. FOR THOSE QUITE ATTEMPTS IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE THEY ARE DEAD. LOVE THE DICTION. ARE VERY DIFFERENT AS WELL AND AGAIN WE DON'T FULLY UNDERSTAND HOW MUCH NICOTINE INDIVIDUALS ARE GETTING IT'S BASED ON THE PRODUCTS ARE USING THE BY AVAILABILITY OF THOSE PRODUCTS. THE FREQUENCY OF USE AND THAT IS STILL NOT PERFECT SCIENCE TO UNDERSTAND THAT. THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITIES ARE RESPONDING. THIS DATE IS ALREADY OUTDATED THAT'S ANOTHER ORDINANCES PASSED EARLIER THIS WEEK BUT AS OF FRIDAY THERE WERE FORTY FOUR LOCAL JURISDICTIONS THAT HAD ORDINANCES. THAT SPECIFICALLY RELATED TO FLAVORED PRODUCTS IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT MUCH OF THIS WORK WAS STARTED EARLY ON IN RESPONSE TO FTA NOT INCLUDING MENTHOL. IN THE BAN ON CIGARETTES SO MUCH OF THIS WORK STARTED TO TRY TO ELIMINATE INFLATED PRODUCTS FROM THE MARKET. AND HAS SINCE EXPANDED TO INCLUDE ALL OF VAPING PRODUCTS I'M OTHER PRODUCTS SUCH AS WHO GOT THE MAJORITY OF HOOKAH BARS IN OUR STATE ACTUALLY WITHIN A MILE OF A COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY CAMPUS SO IT'S NOT SURPRISING THE COLLEGES. COLLEGE STUDENTS HAVE THE HIGHEST RATES OF WHO CAN USE IN OUR STATE. SO WHEN WE LOOK AT THIS MORE MORE COMMUNITIES ARE STARTING TO AMEND THEIR TO FACTORY TELL LICENSE OR DOCKED ORDINANCES SPECIFICALLY BANNING THE SALE OF ALL FLAVORED TOBACCO PRODUCTS ALTHOUGH SOME DO HAVE EXEMPTIONS. WE DO HAVE RIGHT NOW IT'S FOUR ORDINANCES BUT PREVIOUSLY THREE ORDINANCES THAT BANNED THE SALE ELECTRONIC SMOKING DEVICES. I'M SAN FRANCISCO AND RICHMOND HAVE LIMITATIONS ON THEIRS IF FTA WERE TO APPROVE THESE PRODUCTS LIVERMORE SPAN IS A COMPLETE BAN WITH NO END DATE. AND THEN OF COURSE THE BEVERLY HILLS TO PASS AN ORDINANCE THAT BANNED THE SALE F ALL TOBACCO PRODUCTS IN THEIR COMMUNITY WITH THE EXCEPTION. OF THREE CIGAR BARS THAT WERE LEFT IS AN EXEMPTION TO ALLOW USE AND SALE WITHIN THOSE BARS. SO IN SUMMARY WE DO HAVE AN EPIDEMIC AND WE KNOW THAT WE HAVE A HISTORY OF WORKING WITH AN INDUSTRY THAT HAS UTILIZED TACTICS TO TRY TO DISSUADE THE CONVERSATION ON PUBLIC HEALTH. THE NEW E. CIGARETTE COMPANIES HAVE EMPLOYED MANY OF THE SAME STRATEGIES AND THEY'RE UNDER FEDERAL NGHE SHOULDN'T. INTO GRIFFIN FEDERAL LITIGATION FOR THAT RIGHT NOW. THERE ARE NUMEROUS HEALTH CONCERNS WITH ALL OF THESE PRODUCTS IS DR TOM HAD MENTIONED THE HIGH POTENCY OF THESE NEW POPPIES PRODUCTS BOTH WITH NICOTINE BUT ALSO TEACH SHE IS VERY ALARMING. WE SEE SOME OF THE PRODUCTS WE HAD OUR TEAM'S BEEN DOING FOCUS GROUPS FOR YEARS AND ANNUALLY WE ASK THEM ABOUT THE PRODUCTS THAT THEY SEE WHAT PRODUCTS THEY USE. DEPENDS. FULL AS WAX KINDS AND THEY KNOW EXACTLY WHERE TO GET THE CARTRIDGES AND HOW TO GET THEM. WE KNOW THAT YOU THINKING ABOUT THE BEING HAS CONTINUED TO INCREASE AND AS NEW DATA FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SHOWS. IT IS CONTINUING. AND WE KNOW THAT THE BURDEN OF THIS PROBLEM IS CURRENTLY EXISTING OTHER K. THROUGH TWELVE SCHOOLS IN OUR COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES WHERE YOUNG PEOPLE ARE USING THESE PRODUCTS. AND HEALTH SYSTEMS ARE ALSO TRYING TO IDENTIFY HOW DO WE HELP THESE PEOPLE QUIT USING THEM. BUT THERE IS A RESPONSE FOR A LOCAL COMMUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA TO RESPOND. AND THERE ARE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS THROUGHOUT THE STATE THAT ARE GOING TO TRY TO REDUCE THESE RATES AND THE SUPPORT A TOBACCO FREE. CALIFORNIA THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE YOUR PRESENTATION IT'S BOTH VERY INFORMATIVE AND PRETTY ALARMING QUITE FRANKLY. I'D LIKE TO OPEN THIS UP TO THE- TO THE MEMBERS FOR QUESTIONS. QUESTIONS FROM. OKAY MR GRAMM. THANK YOU ARE. FOR YOUR PRESENTATION. I'M CURIOUS. ABOUT THE ATTENTION YOU WENT OVER THE LOCAL ORDINANCES. AT THE CITY AND COUNTY LEVEL TRUCK CALIFORNIANS I NOTICED EVERYONE OF THEM JUST FLAVORED TOBACCO IN ANY SICK YEARS RIGHT YET DURING THE PRESENTATION UNLESS I READ THERE ARE IT COULD BE THAT THE HIGHEST UC'S TO BE MARIJUANA. EXCEPT OR VAPING AMONGST TEENAGERS WHICH SEEMS CONSISTENT SINCE THE- OUTBREAK OF THIS PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS AT LEAST WITH ILLNESSES AND THE- YES I'VE HAD NUMEROUS CONVERSATIONS WITH SCHOOL OFFICIALS IN MY DISTRICT. EVERYONE OF THEM HAS SUGGESTED THAT THE GREAT MAJORITY OF PRODUCTS THAT THEY CONFISCATE FROM YOUNG PEOPLE AT THE HIGH SCHOOLS EVERYONE. AND IS CURIOUS THAT THE PUBLIC POLICY RESPONSE STARTING WITH THE PRESIDENT ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THE LOCAL LEVEL IS RUNNING PRESENTATION. IS EXCLUSIVELY FOCUSED ON EAST SIX. WHEN THAT'S NOT APPARENTLY THE NUMBER ONE DRIVER CERTAINLY A SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTOR WHICH ALSO WAS NOT IN YOUR PRESENTATION WHY DO YOU THINK THAT IS. SO IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE OUR TOBACCO TAX DOLLARS ARE USED TO FIND A COMPREHENSIVE TOBACCO CONTROL PROGRAM TO ADDRESS TOBACCO CONTROL ORDINANCES A SIMILAR PROGRAM FOR MARIJUANA DOES NOT EXIST. IN THE STATE. TO HAVE A PROGRAM THAT EXIST. THAT MY TO. DRIVE MORE OF THESE LOCAL ORDINANCES EFFORTS MAYBE CALLS FOR THE BANNING OF FLAVORED MARIJUANA FOR EXAMPLE. I CAN'T COMMENT ON THAT SPECIFICALLY BUT I A CAN KNOW THAT CALIFORNIA DOES HAVE ONE OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL TOBACCO CONTROL PROGRAMS IN THE WORLD AND IT'S BEEN EXTRAORDINARILY SUCCESSFUL AND REDUCING TOBACCO USE IN OUR STATE AS WELL AS CHANGING NORMS AROUND TOBACCO USE AND STATE. SORRY I RAN INTO SEVERAL YOUNG PEOPLE THEY BEGIN MY DISTRICT OVER THE PAST. THIRTY DAYS AND TOOK THE TIME TO KIND OF CHAT WITH THEM ABOUT. WHAT THEY WERE DOING AND WHAT PRODUCT THEY WERE USING AND- FOR THINGS I FROM KIND OF SHOCKING AND- AND MAYBE SOMETHING WE COULD COME TO EXPECT GIVEN THE PUBLICITY AND THE PRESS REPORTING IN SOME OF THE INFORMATION OUT THERE. IS THAT THEY WERE ALL UNDER THE IMPRESSION. THAT MARIJUANA VAPING. WAS SAFE FROM THE TOBACCO VAPING COULD KILL YOU. I STILL THEY GOT THAT IMPRESSION FROM THE NEWS REPORTS OF SOME OF THE INFORMATION PUT OUT THERE BY ADVOCACY GROUPS AND OTHERS COMICS CLOSELY FOCUSED ON TOBACCO BUT IT SEEMS LIKE A DANGER WHEN CLEARLY WE DON'T QUITE KNOW WHAT'S CAUSING IT AND THE PUBLIC HEALTH WARNINGS TO. NOT PAY PERIOD UNTIL WE HAVE A BETTER IDEA OR PERHAPS. WE DON'T GET A BETTER IDEA PEOPLE SHOULD BE BABY AT ALL. AND IT'S ACTUALLY AN UNSAFE. OR CRITICALLY UNSAFE PRODUCT BY IT STRIKES ME THAT THAT'S A DANGEROUS PUBLIC HEALTH OUTCOME. WHEN YOU HAVE YOUNG PEOPLE NOT INFORMED. ABOUT THE REAL DANGERS WOULD YOU AGREE. CORRECT YES AND AGAIN I AM I GET I'M I'M NOT IN CHARGE OF FUNDING DECISIONS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BUT- DO YOU WANT TO THAT WE HAVE AN INCREDIBLE TOBACCO CONTROL PROGRAM WHO HAS. OBVIOUSLY WHEN WE TALK TO YOUNG PEOPLE I WANT TO NOTE THAT EVEN THOUGH WE HAVE SEEN INCREASES AND BEEPING AMONG YOUNG PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA. IT'S LOWER THAN THE NATIONAL LEVEL SO THE WORK THAT'S BEING DONE. TO ADDRESS TOBACCO CONTROL. AND WE ARE OUR MAKING GOOD SUCCESSES BUT I CAN'T SPEAK TO THE MARIJUANA PREVENTION AND PUBLIC HEALTH ASPECT OF THAT. MISTER COOPER. IS FOR THE SECOND LAURIE OF THAT PROMOTION A RIGHT TO THE NONPROFIT RIGHT SO YOU GUYS GET MONEY IN BLUE THE BIG ISSUE IS I AGREE WITH WHAT MR GRAY SAID OVER TWO BILLION DOLLARS IN TOBACCO TAX REVENUE IS BROUGHT IN BY THE STATE AND YET LESS THAN 3% IS USED FOR ENFORCEMENT SO WHY PUT YOURSELF ON THE BACK PORCH BECAUSE IT DOES. IT'S A DIFFERENT MODEL NOW THINGS HAVE CHANGED WITH THE BABY SO A LOT OF THAT MOVIE AND READING THE INFORMATION HERE ABOUT SOME PAPERWORK WERE MOST THAT WHEN THEY GO TO THE CITIES AND COUNTIES GOALS EDUCATION OR TRAINING BUT NOT AND FOR SOME THAT'S REALLY THE BIG ISSUE WITH THAT IN THIS LEGISLATURE WILL DO WITH THIS ISSUE BECAUSE THE BLACK MARKET THEY'RE THERE TO MAKE MONEY AND MAKE PROFITS FOR THE PEOPLE AND THAT WILL TALK ABOUT LATER ON BUT- WE'VE GOT CHANGE THAT MODEL IT WITH THIS WE ALSO HAVE A GIMMICK THING THIS. BUT YET. TO PROCESS SUFFICIENT UNDER THE AG. OKAY THIRTY EIGHT MILLION THIS YEAR FOR CITY PH IN THE OJ. BUT ONCE AGAIN YOU KNOW AS FAR AS OLD OPERATIONAL. OPERATIONS THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT DOES. DOES NOT GETTING DONE THAT MUCH. SO THERE ARE A WHOLE HOST OF ISSUES WITH THIS BUT I PUT THE BLAME ON THE STATE FOR A LOT OF THESE ISSUES THAT COME UP FOR A LONG TIME. FOR IMMEDIATE ISSUES BUT HOW DO YOU. I GUESS RECTIFY THAT USING MORE MONEY SHOULD BE GIVEN TOWARDS A FORCE MAKERS THING THE RATES ARE LOW. BUT NOW OBVIOUSLY IF THE KEEPING WITH VAPING SO. IN MY OPINION ON THE ENFORCEMENT IN MORE TO BE ALLOCATED BECAUSE- OBVIOUSLY THIS EDUCATION PART IS WORKING WITH SO MUCH. IN THE TRAINING WE WORKING SO MUCH BECAUSE- YOU GO TO A- A BUNCH OPERATE WITHOUT PASHA BUT A- GOOD. PET SHOP WHERE YOU WANT TO CALL IT BUT- THE BLACK MARKET IS OUT THERE SO THESE KIDS CAN GO ANYWHERE THE BLACK MARKET AND GET IT. THEY'RE GONNA SELL SO DO YOU FAVOR OR SUPPORT MORE FUNDING FOR THE ENFORCEMENT. SO I AM I CAN'T SPEAK TO THAT AND I CAN'T TAKE A POSITION ON IT BUT I CAN'T SAY THAT I KNOW THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE IS HERE AND THAT BILL SHARE THE WORK THAT THEY'VE BEEN DOING WITH THE GRANTS THAT THEY'VE BEEN GIVEN OUT. THE GOOD THING THAT'S HAPPENING WITH THE FUNDING FROM PROP FIFTY SIX WITH THE COMBINATION OF FUNDING FOR DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH. THERE'S A LOT OF NEW PARTNERSHIPS TO TRY TO BRING ALLIES AND ENFORCEMENT. FROM THE SCHOOLS AND THEN ALSO FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND COMMUNITY TOGETHER TO IDENTIFY HOW TO COMBAT THAT BUT I'M NOT AN EXPERT ON THE ENFORCEMENT SIDE NOR CAN I SPEAK TO THAT. WHAT THE END OF THE DAY. THE ENFORCEMENT STILL HAPPENS AND LOCAL LEVEL. A COVER. FOR A LONG TIME. DOT PASSES THE MONEY SOLDIER LOCAL SHERIFFS AND POLICE DEPARTMENTS. THAT DO ALL THESE OPERATIONS SO. LIKE I SAID THE FUNDING IS INADEQUATE AND HAS BEEN FOR QUITE SOMETIME. THANK YOU. IT MIGHT BE JUST THAT ALSO IT DEPENDS ON THE SOCIAL NORM OF THE WHOLE SOCIETY SO WE KNOW THAT KIDS ARE NOT. ALWAYS JUST GOING TO THE STORES TO BUY IT THEY'RE GETTING IT. MAYBE FROM THEIR PARENTS WERE AT LEAST SOME OF THE- CONFISCATED PRODUCTS HAVE BEEN. EVEN AMONGST FRIENDS OR FAMILY SO. WE HAVE TO ADDRESS THE WHOLE SOCIETY AND NOT JUST. TARGET AND PUNISHED THE PEOPLE BUT THINK ABOUT. THE WHOLE OF SOCIETY AND ALSO THE HEALTH THE PUBLIC HEALTH GOOD THAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO. IF MY BAG RESTING THIRTY YEARS LAW ENFORCEMENT. IN THEIR THOUSANDS OF SHOPS IN LA THEIR BLACK MARKET SHOPS. SO IT'S RELATIVELY EASY FOR YOU A YOUNG PERSON TO GO TO BLACK MARKET SHOP. IN BY. LIKE THESE COACHES PRISON CHINA BUT- THEY'RE FILLED UP HERE IN CALIFORNIA. BE A CANNABIS OR- THE NICOTINE SO IT HAPPENS HERE. IN THE GOOD OLD USA. SO LIKE I SAID ISSUE IS YOU CAN'T JUST BRING YOU HAD THE GROUND. TO THOSE LISTA SHOPS THAT ARE OUT THERE IN THE THOUSANDS. MR MCCARTY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR OF IT YOU KNOW THIS IS SO OVERWHELMING ON EVEN KNOW WHERE TO START FOR SO MANY PIECES AND I APPRECIATE WELL FIRST OF ALL THANK YOU TO THE THREE CHAIRS FOR BRING US TOGETHER ONE CAME UP I THINK IT WAS LATE AUGUST EARLY SEPTEMBER BEFORE WE SAW A LOT OF THIS MOVEMENT SO. CERTAINLY IS VERY TIMELY AND THE ISSUES AND FRANKLY THE QUESTIONS THAT ARE RISING COME BY THE BY THE DAY IF NOT BY THE HOUR. I DO THINK THAT IS THE OVER ARCHING TOPIC IS IMPORTANT AS YOU SAID DR I THINK THAT'S KIND OF HOW I SET UP THE ARTICULATED VERY WISELY THAT THIS THE YOUTH EPIDEMIC AND WE SEE THE ROMANTICISM WITH THE FLAVORS WHICH I'LL GET TO IN A SECOND FOR THIS OTHER QUESTION THAT THAT IS GREAT DOT IS THIS WHOLE ISSUE THE ALL THE BABY IS IT SAFE IN THE FIRST PLACE SB PERMITTING AND I'M SO THERE'S I KNOW THAT THERE'S LEGAL. MEANS OF IT SOME SAY THE LEGAL PIECES BUT HOW DO YOU DIFFERENTIATE AND I THINK THAT THAT IS A REAL QUESTION WE HAVE TO OFFER ASK OURSELVES SO I WANT TO START WITH THE FIRST AS FAR AS THE OVER THE PRODUCT AS A WHOLE SAW THAT YOUR GREAT POWER POINT IN THE. IN THE DECLINE IN SMOKE IT'S- CROSS. IN ONE OF. THE DESERVE THE STREET THIS IS. AN ALTERNATIVE. AND HAVE BEEN THERE THEY HAVE SAID THAT IT'S A SAFE ALTERNATIVE IN THE FDA OF COURSE. CAME AT THEM AND SAID YOU CAN'T SAY THAT. BUT NOW MY UNDERSTANDING I JUST SAW THIS ADVERTISEMENT CAME UP ON. SOMEONE'S EMAIL YESTERDAY AND THEY SAID TO ME AND IT SAYS IT'S A SATISFYING. ALTERNATIVE SO I GUESS THEY'RE CHANGING THEIR LANGUAGE IT'S NOT A- SAFE ALTERNATIVE TO SATISFYING I GUESS THAT'S NECESSARY. ILLEGAL SO. AS FAR AS THE ALTERNATIVE WHAT WHAT IS THE PUBLIC HEALTH. WORLD SAY ABOUT THAT IS FAR AS HELL TO RICHARD TO STANDARD. TOBACCO SMOKE YES RIGHT SO I THINK THAT'S FIVE UNDERSCORING WHAT THE CDC. HAS EMPHASIZED THERE'S NO STATE TOBACCO PRODUCT AND RELEARNING. ABOUT THE WHAT RANGE OF HEALTH EXCEPT TO SEE AS WELL. WHAT I TELL MY PATIENTS IS. YOUR PLANS ARE MEANT TO BE CLEAN AIR AND SO MICHAEL AS A PROVIDER WILL BE TO HELP YOU QUIT FOR GOOD. SO IT AS AN ALTERNATIVE I WOULD PROBABLY SAY LET'S TRY TO GET YOU TO ZERO. AND HAVE CLEAN LINES. YES IT'S SOMEWHAT SIMILAR TO YEARS AGO THEY CAME OUT WITH FILTERS THEY SAID FILTERED CIGARETTES ARE SAFER AND POTENTIALLY MARGINALLY SAFER BUT BUT ARE THEY SAFE SO MY NURSING WHEN THEY FIRST CAME OUT WITH. THE PATCHES AND THE GUM THERE WERE THERE WERE PRESCRIPTIONS TO GET THEM YOU CAN MY OVER THE COUNTER. HAS THAT EVER BEEN THAT TALKED ABOUT AS HAVING IF THERE IF THERE IS AN ALTERNATIVE TO HAVING IT. UTILIZED BY. MEDICINE LIKE THANK YOU. RIGHT PHARMACY AS OPPOSED TO. HIS LITTLE SHOPS THAT WE SEE AROUND TOWN RIGHT SO HOW TO QUIT ESPECIALLY WHEN NICOTINE IS SO ADDICTIVE THESE MEDICATIONS THOSE FIVE NICOTINE. REPLACEMENT MEDICATIONS ARE MEANT TO HELP PEOPLE WITH ALL SYMPTOMS IS WHICH ARE SPECIALLY WORSE IN THE FIRST COUPLE WEEKS ANXIETY IRRITABILITY. YOU KNOW I'VE SEEN PEOPLE WANT TO LEAVE THE HOSPITAL AGAINST MEDICAL ADVICE BECAUSE THEY CAN'T GO OUT FOR A CIGARETTE BUT- THAT IT CAN REALLY LEAD TO A LOT OF AGITATION SO THOSE MEDICATIONS ARE MEANT OVER TWO TO THREE. MONTHS TO HELP YOU ON HELP YOUR BRAIN LEARN THE NICOTINE ADDICTION AND TO LEARN NEW BEHAVIORS TO REPLACE THE PRODUCT THAT YOU WERE USING. SO YOU KNOW I'VE HEARD IN THE NEWS MEDIA WELL MAYBE PEOPLE TRYING TO QUIT PEIPING SHOULD GO BACK TO CIGARETTES NOTE WE HAVE MEDICATIONS THAT ARE TIME TESTED. UT WHAT WE'RE FACING HERE IS A NEW HIGH POTENCY NICOTINE THAT EVEN. BETTER I DON'T EVEN QUITE HOW DOES PEOPLE I CAN ONLY JUST HOPE TO TRY TO TIE TRIP. TO THEIR NEEDS AND TOLD THEIR OWN SYMPTOMS ARE ABATED. OKAY AND THEN. TO THE PEACE AND ARE YOU TALKED ABOUT THIS KIMBERLY SO. IT'S AB ICING IS A IS A BIG BED AND LITERALLY LAST NIGHT WAS DRIVING THROUGH MY DISTRICT AND WE SEE THE SHOPS ALL OVER THERE. AND WE KNOW THAT THEY THERE IS THE YOUTH ELEMENT WITH THE FLAVOR. HAVE YOU SEEN THE REPORT SAID LGBT COMMUNITY IS HAVE HIGHER NUMBERS FOR THIS LITTLE I SAW SHOP WITH. THE WITH THE PRIDE COLORS I'M SURE YOU CAN SEE IT. IT'S A BLUEBERRY VAPE SHOP. VERY VAGUE AND SMOKE ON WHAT HAPPENED. AND JUST UNBELIEVABLE THAT'S EXACTLY HAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE POPULATION AND IT'S TARGETING. THE COMMUNITY COME TO COME RIGHT IN KNOWING THAT THERE'S THIS ROMANTICISM I KNOW THAT I HAVE. ELEVEN YEAR OLD GIRLS AND THEY'RE SELLING GIRL SCOUT COOKIES RIGHT OVER HERE IT'S A FLAT. AND ONE OF MY DAUGHTERS SAW SOMEBODY COMING OUT IN VAPING THE SENTIMENTS LIKE DAY THAT THAT. DILUTES IT SMELLS REALLY GOOD IT SMELLS LIKE IT TASTES REALLY GOOD TOO. ELEVEN YEAR OLD. YES SO YOU KNOW THESE KIDS HAVE EVERYTHING AROUND THEM THE STATE SCHOOL THAT THEY HAVE THE ADVERTISING IN CELL THIS IS A CRAZY CRAZY EPIDEMIC AND IT'S COMING FROM ALL DIFFERENT ANGLES AND YOU KNOW IT'S PART OF ITS OF COMING UPON US TO REALLY ACT AND I KNOW THERE'S NO ONE SOLUTION. I GET THAT IS NOT ONE BILL ONE THING I KNOW TALK ABOUT LESTER'S OF A PACKAGE OF THINGS ON THE MENU TO DO TO TACKLE THIS AND I THINK THAT THE WORK WE WERE DOING THIS TODAY THE CONVERSATION HOPEFULLY GET BE PUSHING SOME POLICY IN THE NEAR FUTURE CITIES ARE STEPPING UP AND DOING IT TOO BUT- I DON'T THINK THAT ONE. FLAVOR BANNER POLICY IS GOING TO YOU KNOW. EVEN IF YOU GO AFTER THE SHOPS AND MISTER GRAY AND I HAD SOME AMAZING. EXHORTATIONS THIS PAST YEAR TALKING ABOUT THE SHOPS THAT ARE GETTING SICK THE STINGS IT'S NOT THE GROCERY STORES IT'S THE LITTLE MON POSH SHOPS AND THEY'RE THE ONES ARE HAVING THE HUGE HUGE NUMBERS AND SO HAVING MORE ENFORCEMENT THERE LIKE MISTER COOPER SO I THINK IS PART OF THE SOLUTION. BUT EVEN IF WE SHUT DOWN THAT YOU KNOW KIDS ARE SMART. THEY FIGURE OUT MOM'S HOUSE WHERE TO AMAZON AND BUY STUFF ONLINE AND SO IT'S GONNA TAKE A MULTITUDE OF WAYS TO GO AFTER THIS SO AT THE LAST TOPIC I WANTED DISCUSSES. I UNDERSTAND THAT IT'S A NEW WANTS TO ISSUE WITH THAT WITH THE NON TOBACCO. VAPING AND FIRST ONE EVEN KNOW HOW MANY. IF THERE IS IT IS IT PREVALENT FOR THAT CANNABIS VAPING AND FLAVORS. DO DO WE KNOW THAT. SO I TRIED TO GET DATA ON THE BEEPING SPECIFICALLY I HAVE TEACH SEE AND FLAVOR TEACH SEE AND I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THAT EXISTS. OKAY SO IF IT HAS MISTER GRACE SUGGEST IF WE DID HAVE A ACROSS THE BOARD NO FLAVOR FOR TOBACCO AND CANNABIS REALLY KNOW HOW MUCH THAT WOULD IMPACT THAT. CANNABIS VAPING PRODUCTS. POTENTIALLY IT'S YET CORRECT MY EXPERTISE IS NOT IN TEACH SEASIDE SO I'M NOT AWARE OF WHAT PERCENT OF VAPING DEVICES ARE SOLD IN FLAVORS AND WHAT PERCENT OF YOUNG PEOPLE ARE BEEPING FLAVORED WAX PENS OKAY WORD PEACHY DEVICES AND IN THE LAST ISSUE IN THIS THE QUESTION WHICH I THINK IS THE QUESTION WE'RE ASKING ABOUT THE ILLNESS IS AND IT'S MAINLY FROM. THE THC PRODUCTS AND THE INDUSTRY SAYING HEY THAT'S NOT OUR PRODUCT THAT'S THE ILLEGAL BLACK MARKET PRODUCT IS COMING OVER AND THEY'RE NOT HAVING THE SAME METALS IN THERE THAT WE HAVE BEEN TESTED AND SO FOR I DON'T KNOW THE SCIENCE. I MAY BE MESSING THAT UP. BUT I WOULD ASSUME THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE. WHO USE THIS PRODUCT THEY USE IT ALL RIGHT THEY DON'T THEY'RE NOT. THEY DON'T TO JUST DO ONE OR THE OTHER SO IT'S HARD TO TELL WHICH ONE. WAS THE CULPRIT. AND SO IS THERE A WAY TO HAVE AND- THEY FONG NUANCED WAY FOR THE CANNABIS PRODUCTS. AND GO AFTER. THE DEVICES THAT ARE REALLY CAUSING HARM CAN WE UNDERSTAND THAT. IT ALMOST GETTING AT YES BUT I THINK THAT'S WHY THE CDC HAS COME OUT SAYING OUT OF ALL THE FIVE HUNDRED AND SO. THINGS THEY COULD GET FROM THE CASES THAT WERE SICK. AND THEY COULDN'T FIND ONE SUBSTANCE OR ONE PRODUCT TO. CALL UPON THAT'S WHY THEY'RE STILL MAKING THAT VERY STRONG STATEMENT EVERYONE PLEASE JUST STOP THE DENTAL WILL TRY TO FIGURE THIS OUT. I DON'T THINK WE REALLY KNOW AND I. SO FAR THERE'S NO SUGGEST TO SAY AS A SAFE DEVICE. OR WAY OF VAPING OR WHAT CHEMICAL SO THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY IS WITH THE CDC AND SAME. WITH THE ALL THE QUESTIONS AND NOT ENOUGH ANSWERS WE SHOULD JUST DO IT TIME OUT ON ALL THE STUFF. I THINK THAT WOULD BE. THE SAME THING FOR PUBLIC HEALTH. AND IT IS THEIR ONGOING RESEARCH THAT THE LABELS YOU TO SEE IF THEY- THEIR DEVICES THAT ARE. LEGALLY SOLD. DO YOU HAVE SOME SAFETY REQUIREMENTS IN THEM. THAT SO THIS IS WHERE THE FTA REGULATION IS SUPPOSED TO COME INTO PLAY WHERE THE MANUFACTURERS ARE SUPPOSED TO SUBMIT. INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR PRODUCTS AND THE EFFECT ON HEALTH. SO THAT'S WHY THAT DEADLINE THAT MORATORIUM IS NOW. BEING UP TO NEXT YEAR OKAY THANK YOU AND I KNOW OUR LATER PANEL HAS. THE COUNCIL THAT POTENTIALLY THESE ISSUES WILL BE ADDRESSED. THANK YOU THE KINGS CHAIR THANK YOU SO WE HAVE MISTER MISS LOAN MISTER LOW AND THEN MISTER COOPER AGAIN. THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATION I THINK FOR ME I FIRST STARTED THINKING ABOUT THIS IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN TWELVE WHEN I WAS A SCHOOL BOARD AND WE DID NOT KNOW IF OUR TOBACCO POLICY FOR STUDENT CONDUCT ACTUALLY COVERED MEETING IT WAS VERY CONFUSING THEN WE DIDN'T KNOW IF THE LAW. ALLOWED FOR THAT AND I THINK SINCE THEN THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAVE EVOLVED IN THE THINKING AND I KNOW SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES HAVE TOUCHED UPON. ISSUES OF ENFORCEMENT OR IMPACT. ONE OF THE CITY I HEARD IN THIS PRESENTATION REPEAT. THE LACK OF UNDERSTANDING AND EDUCATION WHICH I FIND TO BE ONE OF THE HARDER THINGS TO DO TO EDUCATE THE PUBLIC. AND SO I JUST WONDERED IF YOU COULD SPEAK TO WHAT YOU'RE SEEN IN TERMS OF BEST PRACTICES EDUCATING. THE USE WORK OUR PUBLIC ABOUT THIS CERTAINLY THERE HAVE BEEN ARTICLES. CLEARLY THE ARTICLES HAVE NOT HAD AN IMPACT ON NO MASS NUMBER OF MINERS. I DECREASING THEIR USE AT LEAST NOT WITH THE DAY THAT YOU PRESENTED SO WHAT ARE THE BEST PRACTICES WHAT WHAT IS CALIFORNIA DOING WELL TO TRY TO EDUCATE MINORS. AND ADULTS ABOUT THE IMPACT. THANK QUESTION AGAIN REFER BACK TO THE TRACK CONTROL PROGRAM. CALIFORNIA SO THE FOR THE FOCUS OF THAT PROGRAM PROGRAM IS TO DE NORMALIZE THE USE OF TOBACCO CONTROL AND PART OF THAT IS BY ENGAGING COMMUNITIES TO CHANGE THE NORMS OF. ACCESS TO TOBACCO THE EXPOSURE TO THE ADVERTISING AND MARKETING TO VARIOUS TOBACCO PRODUCTS AND RETAIL ENVIRONMENTS I'M ALSO THERE'S A LOT OF WORK HAPPENING AT THE LOCAL LEVEL TO CHANGE THE NUMBER THE DENSITY OF RETAILERS AND COMMUNITIES THE LOCATION OF THOSE RETAILERS AND MOVING THEM AWAY FROM SCHOOLS SO THAT'S PART OF IT THE SECOND SIDE IS TO DO THE MEDIA CAMPAIGN. AND TO TRY TO ENGAGE. AND WHAT'S ANYA. AROUND NOT JUST THE DANGERS OF THE PRODUCTS BUT WHAT'S HAPPENING WITHIN COMMUNITIES AND TOBACCO INDUSTRY TACTICS AND SO THAT WORK IS CONTINUING. SO THAT'S JUST A SIDE THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH PASSED. THE PART OF EDUCATION WHO'S ALSO PARTNER IN THIS WORK THEN DOES THE SCHOOL WORK SPECIFICALLY AND SO THERE FUNDING THROUGH THEIR TOBACCO USE PREVENTION EDUCATION PROGRAM. BINGO OPPOSED TO TRY TO TRAIN TEACHERS. AND EDUCATE PARENTS AND ADMINISTRATORS ON THE PROBLEM OF THESE PRODUCTS WHAT HI THIS OFF GUARD WAS HOW QUICKLY IS PRESS ROOM. AND AS ASSEMBLY FOR GREAT DEAD THAT OFTENTIMES WE GO. TO SCHOOLS AND WE ASK WHAT PRODUCT YOUNG PEOPLE ARE USING. I'VE I REMEMBER I WAS ACTUALLY AND I'M MADERA COUNTY AND TALK TO SOME. WORKING WITH HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS AND LEARN THE ALL OF THE PRODUCTS THEY CONFISCATED WERE WAX PEN AND I WAS SURPRISED BY THAT BUT WHEN WE TALK TO STUDENTS WE FIND OUT THAT THEY ARE CONSTANTLY TRYING TO BE AHEAD OF THE GAME SO WHEN WE FOCUS JUST ON JUL. PARENTS KNOW WHAT TOOLS ARE SO THEY'RE LOOKING FOR JEWEL AND SO THEN KIDS GO TO SOARING OR THEY GO TO NOVA OR ANY OF THE OTHER NEW PRODUCTS AND SO IS TRYING TO GET THE BIGGER PICTURE NOT JUST FOCUS ON A PRODUCT BUT TRYING TO CREATE HEALTHIER COMMUNITIES BY. REMOVING PRODUCTS AND THEN BY HAVING MEDIA CAN. TO MAKE PEOPLE. AS WAS ALSO NOTED A LOT OF THE COMPREHENSIVE POLICIES AT LOCAL JURISDICTIONS ARE CREATING NOT SO MUCH ON THE SALES ON THE USE OF THESE PRODUCTS. I KNOW THAT THE MAJORITY OF OUR COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES IN THE STATES HAVE. COMPREHENSIVE POLICIES THAT COVER THE INHALATION OR YOU HAVE ANY COMBUSTIBLE OR V. BRACE PRODUCT ON THEIR CAMPUS. AND THE IDEA THAT IF WE CAN REMOVE THE DISRUPTING VISIBLE THAT CHANGE THE NORM THEN THAT WILL THEN. CHANGE PEOPLE'S USE BECAUSE IT'S NOT WANTS TO USE THAT. IT'S A REALLY COMPREHENSIVE PROGRAM THAT COMMUNITIES ARE WORKING ON COMMITTEE COLLECTIONS ARE. THE STATE. DEPARTMENT PUBLIC OF HAS A REALLY ROBUST VERY SICK. IMMEDIATE AND THEN THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION IS WORKING WITH IN SCHOOLS TO TRY TO DRAW FROM APPROACH. BOB PARENTS TO MAKE THEM AWARE OF THESE AND THEN REALLY HELPING TO A QUICK STOP TO EQUIP TRUSTED ADULTS TO BE ABLE TO ASK THE QUESTION ABOUT USE TO ADVISED ENCOURAGE QUITE A TIMES AND THEN TO REFER THEM TO SERVICES THAT CAN HELP THEM QUIT. IT'S CLEAR YOU SOUNDS IT IS NO DOUBT THAT IT'S COPPER. MY CONCERN IS THAT DESPITE HOW COMPREHENSIVE IT IS THE PROBLEM. IN THE POTENTIAL SOLUTION AND SO I'M JUST WONDERING IF OUR DEFINITION OR UNDERSTANDING OF COMPREHENSIVE IS GOING TO HAVE TO ADAPT TO A PROBLEM THAT THE VAULT I'M NOT A VERY FAST TO AND DEEP WAY AND I THINK I'M TRYING TO GRAPPLE. WITH THAT SO I APPRECIATE THE FEEDBACK. MAY I ADD THAT THE DOCTORS NEED TO BE EDUCATED AS WELL. WE DO IT WE DON'T KNOW HOW TO ASK AND TREAT THESE THINGS AND THE WHAT THE KIDS ARE DOING WE DON'T EVEN KNOW THAT THEY'RE THE SAME PARENTS. OR THE PROVIDERS WHO ARE TRYING TO KEEP. MAY NOT KNOW THAT YOU KNOW THIS PROBLEM IS OUT THERE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH IN THE GARAGE DOCTOR TALKING IT CAN REALLY FOR PRESENTATION I WILL ADMIT TO THAT YOUR PRESENTATION SCARE THE CRAP OUT OF ME. BECAUSE WE HAVE DONE IS SUCH HARD WORK IN TRYING TO ADDRESS THIS PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS NOW. SEEMS TO BE COMING RIGHT BACK AGAIN AND SO THE SENSE OF URGENCY IS VERY REAL BUT I WANT TO MAKE PERHAPS CALL YOUR ATTENTION TO THE SLIDE THAT YOU PROVIDED TO US WITH RESPECT TO ONE THIRD OF TO. SHOPS AND VAPE SHOP SOLD HIM IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN. YOUR GRAPHIC HERE ABOUT 34% OF USAGE COMES FROM TOBACCO AND BABY. A BIG SHALL SPECIFICALLY SO THAT OF ONE THIRD GOING TO THAT OF MINORS. WE HEARD EARLIER ABOUT THAT OF LOCALS AND SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN THE CHALLENGES OF LOCAL MUNICIPALITIES TRYING TO TACKLE THIS ISSUES OF BANDS OUT RIGHT. AND OFTENTIMES AT THE STATE LEVEL WE BATTLE ON. THAT OF LOCAL CAN OVER THIS A MILLION. THAT THE LOCALS ARE NOT NECESSARILY CONTROL. AS I'VE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO MEET OF WHEN WE'RE NOW AT A SESSION WITH LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICT AND BOARD MEMBERS THIS IS THE NUMBER ONE ISSUE THAT THEY ARE HEARING AND SEEING ABOUT THAT THEY ARE NOT ABLE TO TACKLE THIS AND THEY'RE ASKING SPECIFICALLY FOR ADDITIONAL HELP OFTEN THE STATE TO ATTACK THIS DO YOU HAVE ANY AGAINST INSIGHTS WITH RESPECT TO THAT OF LOCALS AND THE ROLE OF STATE VERSUS LOCAL AND AGAIN. SEEING THAT THE LACK OF ENFORCEMENT SPECIFICALLY GOING TO SELLING TO MINORS OF ONE THIRD GOING TO TOBACCO STORES DO YOU HAVE ANY SENSE ON THE OBSERVATIONS OR MECHANISMS TO YOUR HEARING AS YOU ARE ENGAGING TALKING TO THOSE MOST IMPACTED. THEIR NUMBER JURISDICTIONS ARE STRONGER TUCKER RETAIL INSTANCES MANY DON'T HAVE RETAIL LICENSES RIGHT NOW AND ARE LOOKING AT ADOPTING THEM WITH STRONGER FEES ASSOCIATED STRONGER PASSED TO YOU AND THEN ALSO THE INCLUSION OF FLAVOR BANDS. THAT THE PHONE FLAVOR VAN IS BECAUSE I KNOW THAT. PEOPLE ARE IN THIS BACK TO YOU SPEAK HAS THE PROPER. THEY SEEM LESS WELL AS SALT. THOSE PRODUCTS IT'S ELIMINATING PRODUCTS THAT ARE ATTRACTING USED TO PURCHASE. YOUR BY THE BED TO IT AS WELL SOURCE IN THE TRANS A GIVEN YOUR PRESENTATION THERE ARE THAT THAT'S A RELATIVELY SMALL SEGMENT OF LOCAL MUNICIPALITIES THAT HAVE ACTUALLY TAKEN ACTION. AND YET THE IMPACTED POPULATIONS SINGS. IT IS TO USE ALSO SHOWN THE PERCENTAGE CONTINUES TO RISE BUT AGAIN I THINK IT MAY BE DO YOU HAVE ANY INSIGHTS WITH RESPECT TO DO YOU BELIEVE THAT. LOCAL JURISDICTIONS ARE ACTUALLY DOING WHAT THEY CAN AND SHOULD BE DOING TO TRY TO TACKLE THIS ISSUE IS GIVEN THE RATES AND THEN ALSO GIVEN THE STATISTICS OF THAT OF ENFORCEMENT GOING TO MINORS BECAUSE AGAIN LOCAL CITY HERE ALL THE TIME THE CONTROL BUT THEY'RE CLEARLY NOT AGAINST ALL IF. OF THE MIND MINERS ARE BEING SOLD THESE PRODUCTS. I THINK THAT SOME JURISDICTIONS IN THE STATE HAVE A STRONGER HISTORY OF ADOPTING STRONG TOBACCO CONTROL ORDINANCES AND WE SEE THAT WITH THOSE JURISDICTIONS HAVING POLICIES IN PLACE NOW. I KNOW THAT THERE'S A LOT OF WORK BEING DONE THROUGHOUT THE STATE BUT I KNOW THAT THEIR REGIONS WHERE IT MAY NOT BE HAPPENING. SURE DID YOU OFF THE TOP HER HEAD YOU TO JUST REFERENCE THAT NUMBER OF JURISDICTIONS THAT HAVE COMPREHENSIVE POLICIES THAT MAYBE HE'S- DOING BETTER WITH RESPECT TO THAT OF ENFORCEMENT AND SOME HIS BOSS ALREADY. I CAN'T SPEAK TO THAT AND FORCE MEANT PIECE BUT I KNOW THAT. SPECIFICALLY THE BAY AREA HAS BEEN THE CHAMPION. FOR FLAVORED ORDINANCE I WE KNOW THAT LOS ANGELES HAS RECENTLY THERE COUNTY HAS RECENTLY HAD AN ORDINANCE THE CITY IS LOOKING AT AN ORDINANCE. THE CITY OF SACRAMENTO'S WHICH JUST WENT INTO EFFECT. SO DEFINITELY MORE OF THE URBAN COMMUNITIES HAVE ORDINANCES THAT ARE. ALREADY ADOPTED OR CLOSER TO ADOPTION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MISTER COOPER. A FOLLOW UP TO DISCLOSE QUESTIONS ORDINANCES THEY HAPPEN IN PLACE BUT YOU WALK AROUND DOWNTOWN OUTSIDE PEOPLE STILL VAPING BE AT SACRAMENTO LA OR SAN FRANCISCO BUT ONLY BACK TO DOCTOR CDCS TO TAKE A BREAK FROM VAPING AND THAT'S JUST UNREALISTIC I THINK WHEN PEOPLE ARE INVOLVED IN ADDICTION BE IT TOBACCO ALCOHOL THE C. DRUGS. IT IS TOUGH TO KEEP NO MATTER WHAT. SO WE'VE GOT A WHOLE GROUP OF PEOPLE. OUT THERE AND I THINK IT'S UNREALISTIC TO DO THAT MAYBE TEN YEARS FROM NOW WHATEVER WE FIND OUT WE MORE INFORMATION ON THIS I DON'T KNOW THERE'S NO TIME LINE REALLY AND I'M SURE IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN ANYTIME SOON. SO BEING REALISTIC. THEY'RE NOT TAKING A BREAK. I GUESS THAT'S THE DOCTOR. VAPING IF IT'S I GUESS IF IT'S NOT FROM THE BLACK MARKET IS STILL SAFER THAN SMOKING TOBACCO THEN. SO I THINK THIS IS WHERE THE FTA REGULATION AS OF THE CIGARETTES IS STILL NOT THERE AND- THIS IS FOR THE MANUFACTURERS TO SUBMIT INFORMATION ABOUT HEALTH SO I DON'T THINK WE CAN EVEN MAKE THAT STATEMENT THAT IT'S A SAFE AND IT RIGHT NOW THE CITY SAYING THERE IS NO. SAFE TOBACCO PRODUCT. WE KNOW THAT THEIR INHALING THESE CHEMICALS WITH VAPING CAN HAVE IMMEDIATE HEALTH EFFECTS SO. AS THE SURGEON GENERAL HAS NOTED YOU KNOW EVEN FOR NON USERS SECONDHAND AEROSOL HAS HARMFUL CONSTITUENTS. SO I THINK WHAT WE'RE SEEING RIGHT NOW IS MAYBE WHAT YOU'RE REFERRING TO IS. DOES MAYBE HAVING LESS CARCINOGEN AND SOME OF THESE PRODUCTS MAYBE DOES THAT MEAN LESS HARM AND I THINK THAT'S WHY I'M TRYING TO. ALSO SHOW OF THIS IS MAYBE WHAT WAS FOR LOW TOP BEFORE BUT IT. SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE TO KEEP COMING EVERY DAY. THE MEDIA BIOLOGICAL EFFECTS AND IT'LL TAKE A FEW YEARS TO GET EPIDEMIOLOGY DATA SO I THINK THAT'S WHERE A LOT OF THE PUBLIC CONFUSION IS WHERE THEY THINK THESE ARE NEWER SAFER CLEANER PRODUCTS THEY DON'T MAKE YOU SMELL IT MIGHT MUST BE BETTER BUT I THINK WE ARE NOW. FINDING OUT. THERE IS STILL A LOT OF. ON THE SCIENCE SO FAR THE SIGNS THIS. THIS IS NOT A SAFE PRODUCT SO FOR SOME THE PREVIOUS VAPING PENS FROM NICOTINE PART THAT ONE THREE FTA THEY WERE APPROVED BY THE FDA AND TESTED. THE NEVER WHAT WHAT WHAT ARE THE MANUFACTURE SUBMITTED TO THE FDA RIGHT SO I THINK AND TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN AT THE DEEMING RULED BY THE FDA IS THAT IT HAS A FORTY. TO REGULATE E. CIGARETTES BUT RIGHT NOW WHATEVER'S ON THE LABEL IT'S NOT REGULATED BUT THAT HASN'T BEEN IMPLEMENTED YET SO THAT'S WHY THEY STARTED TRYING TO MOVE UP THAT MORATORIUM TO SAY START SUBMITTING IT'S ACTUALLY IN THESE THINGS THE FDA DOES FUND WHAT'S CALLED TO COURT THESE TOBACCO CENTERS OF REGULATORY AND SEVEN PRODUCING SOME OF THIS. SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE AND IT NEEDS TO BE COMPILED AND THEY'RE ALSO INFORMING THE FTA ABOUT THESE PRODUCTS AS WELL SO. IT'S STILL EARLY STAGES TO SAY THAT THESE THAT WE EVEN KNOW WHAT'S IN THESE PRODUCTS AND THE EFFECTS ON HUMAN HEALTH SO THE MEDIA'S BEEN ALL OVER THIS NAY FAMILIAR EGGS. A LOT OF TEST SAMPLES FOR TESTING AND FROM WHAT I'VE- SEEN. IN THE MEDIA. OTHER TESTS OF THAT CAME BACK. WERE FROM THE ILLICIT MARKET. BE IT TOBACCO OR CANNABIS. IN NOT THE GYM IT MANUFACTURES. SO AS IN WHEN YOU LOOK AT THIS I MEAN A LOT OF IT COMES FROM. EARLIER YOU GUYS TALKED ABOUT THE BRICK AND MORTAR IT'S LIKE SEVENTY FOUR PERCENT. A LOT OF IT COMES FROM THE ILLICIT MARKET SO. HEY IT IT SEEMS TO ME IN JUST AS A LEYVA IN THAT THAT IS A BIG ISSUE WITH IT WHERE A LOT OF THESE PRODUCTS DO COME FROM. NO DOUBT THAT SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE REGULATED AND YOU KNOW AS YOU'RE MENTIONING YOU KNOW WE NEED. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE TO ALSO HELP WITH THIS BUT AS- YOU KNOW I THINK. IT'S VERY CHALLENGING BECAUSE THE PRODUCTS THAT THE CDC INVESTIGATION HAS THEN IT'S NOT EVEN ALL OF THE CASES THAT THEY'VE BEEN ABLE TO GET THE PRODUCTS AND TEST SO THEY DON'T KNOW AND THAT'S WHAT THEY CONCLUDE IS RIGHT NOW THERE IS NO SINGLE PRODUCT OR SUBSTANCE. AT THE SAME TIME THEY'RE SAYING PLEASE ASK SOME OF THESE QUESTIONS ABOUT WHERE PEOPLE GETTING IT HOW ARE THEY USING IT WHAT ARE THEY FILLING IT UP WITH AND THEY'RE ASKING DOCTORS TO ASK THESE QUESTIONS TO HELP IT OUT. WE DON'T KNOW. THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE. I'D LIKE TO GO AHEAD OF ALL OF THE LAST YEAH. SO MY COLLEAGUES HAVE INSPIRED SOME ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS FOR YOU. WHAT IS IT YOU KNOW THE DEBATE OR DISCUSSION THE DIALOGUE IN THE STATE LEGISLATURE IN CALIFORNIA THIS YEAR. WAS PREDOMINANTLY ON ONE HAND FOLKS THAT WANTED TO FOCUS. ON THE MORATORIUM FOR THE BANNING OF FLAVORED. HE SAID PRODUCTS. AND THE OTHER. BLESSED AFTER WE HAD WAS TO FOCUS MORE ON THE OVERSIGHT REGULATION TAXATION OF THE SIX AS WE DO IN TO PATRICIA TRACK. I WAS INVOLVED IS ONE OF THE AUTHORS ON THE OVERSIGHT REGULATORY APPROACH AND THE INSPIRATION FOR THAT WAS FRANKLY ATTRITIONAL TRACK RIGHT WE'VE SEEN INTEREST MICHAEL EDUCATION OVERSIGHT REGULATION TAXATION HAS BEEN A SUCCESSFUL. RECIPE TO REDUCE CONSUMPTION WITH YOUTH AND THE GENERAL PUBLIC RIGHT. AND SOMETIMES WE DON'T NEED TO BE SMARTER THAN OURSELVES UP HERE BUT RATHER LOOK AT AFFECTED PRACTICES IN THE REPLICATION THIS IS SO. AT ONE POINT WE HAD A BILL BEFORE LEGISLATURE THAT OF THE FIFTEEN THOUSAND REPORTED. TOBACCO FLAVORS EASTICK FLAVORS THAT WERE OUT THERE WOULD HAVE RESTRICTED THE SALE FOURTEEN THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED NINETY SEVEN AMONG CONSISTENT WITH TRADITIONAL TRACK WHERE YOU HAVE MEANT ALL INTERNATIONAL TOBACCO FLAVORS AVAILABLE BUT NOT. SOME OF THESE FLAVORS THAT WE DISCUSSED EARLIER. AND. THE COMMITTEE THAT I SERVE ON THE REGULATORY TRACK OF ALCOHOL AS WELL AND I WOULD POINT TO PROHIBITION IN THE EARLY PART OF THE LAST CENTURY AS AN EXAMPLE OF WHERE MORE TRAINS BANDS. AREN'T ACTUALLY ALWAYS EFFECTIVE IN FACT SOMETIMES THEY SERVE TO EXASPERATED BLACK MARKET. AND NOW IS WERE FACED WITH REAL HEALTH CONCERNS THAT ALL EVIDENCE THUS FAR SEEMS TO POINT TO BLACK MARKET PRODUCTS. I HAVEN'T SEEN I HAVEN'T READ A LOT THAT SUGGESTS THE LEGAL THC AND OR TOBACCO PRODUCTS WERE COSTS THAT THEY MAY BE AND OTHERS A LOT YET TO LEARN. BUT WE CERTAINLY KNOW THAT SOME OF THESE BLACK MARKET PRODUCTS HAVE CAUSED SOME DAMAGE. SO. DO YOU AGREE OR DO YOU NOT AGREE BASED ON YOUR WORK. THAT REGULATORY OVERSIGHT EDUCATION TAXATION WOULDN'T BE A GOOD DIRECTION TO GO FOR. THE SIX JUST AS WE'VE DONE WITH TRADITION TOBACCO OR DO YOU SHARE THE VIEW. THAT WE ARE YOU SOMETHING ENTIRELY DIFFERENT DO MORE OF A PROHIBITION STYLE A BAN ON PRODUCTS. THE SPORT. THAT WAS. JUST THAT WAS A SOFTBALL QUESTION BECAUSE YOU WERE. I CAN WRITE. WELL I THINK THIS IS A PERSONALLY AND I'M JUST SPEAKING FOR MYSELF I MEAN I THINK THIS IS SOMETHING I MEAN PEIPING IS SO NEW ALL THESE HEALTH EFFECTS AND HEALTH HARMS ARE JUST GROWING WE HAVE TO LOOK AT EVERY SINGLE OPTION I MEAN FOR SURE. TO CONTROL AT WHATEVER WE CAN IS MOST IMPORTANT. I THINK WE'RE LEARNING EVEN. TWO ONE BUT- YOU KNOW AS A PROVIDER THE OPIATE EPIDEMIC IS VERY MUCH ON ALL OF OUR MINDS AND THIS IS SOMETHING WE ARE TASKED VERY HEAVILY TO DO. AND THAT WAS UNDER A MEDICAL MODEL AND NOT A MARKET MODEL. SO EVEN THAT YOU KNOW WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE ADDICTION IS A VERY CHALLENGING THING THAT PEOPLE GET FROM MANY DIFFERENT SOURCES AND A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH IS VERY MUCH NEEDED. AND I WOULD SAY THE SAME. IN REGARDS TO. THE TYPE OF WORK THAT'S BEING DONE AND WE KNOW AND WE LOOK BACK TO TWO THOUSAND NINE WE KNOW THAT WHEN WE REMOVE FLAVORS FROM CIGARETTES. HEARING CALIFORNIA EVERY POPULATION HOW TO DECREASE IN CIGARETTE CONSUMPTION WITH THE EXCEPTION OF AFRICAN AMERICANS WHO HAVE THE HIGHEST RATES OF MONTHLY DID USE. SO WE KNOW THAT THERE IS A POSITIVE IMPACT BY REMOVING THOSE FLAVORED PRODUCTS. AND SO I CAN ONLY BE ASSUMES THAT WHEN WE LOOK AT THE TWO DIFFERENT ISSUES AND I AGREE WITH DOCTOR WOULD THAT WE HAVE AN ISSUE HAVE YOU FACING. AND I INCREASING AND THEN WE HAVE THE ISSUE OF THE ILLNESSES. BUT LOOKING SPECIFICALLY AT THE U. FACING SIDE THAT. REMOVING YOU FRIENDLY PRODUCTS AND FLAVORED PRODUCTS FROM THE MARKET. WHAT HAPPENED. ON YOUTH USE OF THE PRODUCTS AND EVENTUALLY. THEIR TRANSITION TO OTHER TOBACCO PRODUCTS DOWN THE ROAD WHICH WHAT THE RESEARCH IS SHOWING US. I TEND TO AGREE WITH THAT. IS WHY WE- DESIGNED THE BILL THAT WE ARE WORKING ON. SELECT TOBACCO EXACTLY WHICH IS BANNING FLAVORS OUTSIDE OF TRADITIONAL TOBACCO FLAVORS MENTAL AND INTERNATIONAL TOBACCO. SOME THAT DID WORK IN SEEMS LIKE COULD WORK AGAIN THE OTHER EFFORTS ON FLAVORS. ARE DIFFERENT THAN WHAT YOU JUST DESCRIBED. THE OTHER QUESTION I HAD. IS AVAILABILITY AND POPULARITY OF NICORETTE. YES THE QUESTION IS WHAT WHAT WHEN I FIRST LEARNED ABOUT THE CIGARETTE OF A PICKUP TRUCK I WENT AND WANTED TO SEE ALL OF THESE CRAZY FLAVORS RIGHT AYE CAPTAIN CRUNCH AND BUBBLE GUM THIS AND ICE CREAM THAT. AND SO I WENT TO THE JEWEL WEBSITE. START LOOKING THEY FIND ANY OF. I HAD BEEN TOLD OTHERS ALWAYS CRAZY YOU KNOW FIFTEEN THOUSAND FOR EVER SINCE I WON THE WEBSITE AND FOUND FRUIT MEANT. AND SEVERAL OTHERS RIGHT AND I LOOKED AT A COUPLE OTHER COMPANY WEBSITES AND FOUND SIMILAR. SIMILAR RESULTS. WHAT STRUCK ME ABOUT THAT IS I WAS FAMILIAR THROUGH SOME FRIENDS AND FAMILY WITH FOLKS WHO HAD USE NICORETTE THE PAST. AND IT STRUCK ME THERE WERE SIMILAR OF NICORETTE FLAVORS. AND I WAS RIGHT THERE'S A TYPE OF FRUIT MEANT SAME TYPES OF FLAVORS THAT WERE OFFERED IN THESE PRODUCTS. WHY NOT SEE AN EPIDEMIC OF NICORETTE USE. AMONG STATES IF IN FACT JUST BEING LOGICALLY CONSISTENT THE FLAVORS DRIVE CONSUMPTION TEENS THAT I WOULD ASSUME WE SHOULD NEVER NICORETTE EPIDEMIC. AND I DON'T BELIEVE WE HAVE. THAT'S ON THE DOCTOR. SURE SO USUALLY. NICOTINE GUM OR LOZENGE IS USUALLY TWO MILLIGRAMS OF NICOTINE WE'RE TALKING THESE TOOL PARTS THAT THE MANUFACTURER SAYS HAS LIKE FIFTY SIX MILLIGRAMS. AND THAT'S SUPPOSED TO BE THE EQUIVALENT OF AT LEAST ONE PACK OF CIGARETTES SO WHEN YOU'RE HAVING FLAVORS FLAVORS IS JUST ONE PART OF THE MARKETING AND IT'S ALSO THE TASTE THAT MASKS. MAYBE WHATEVER BITTERNESS EVEN IN NYC NICOTINE GUM OR LOZENGE YOU KNOW PATIENTS SAY THEY'RE SOME PEPPERY TASTE THAT BOTHERS THEM IN THE MIDST NOMS IT AND MASKS THAT SO. I THINK WE'RE TALK THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TAUGHT AT THE HIGH POTENCY NICOTINE PLUS. THE FLAVOR THEY PEEL OF FLAVORAND THAT IN THE NATION I THINK IS SOMETHING. THAT'S WAY DIFFERENT FROM THESE VAPING PRODUCTS THAT AND WITH. THE MESSAGE THAT THE F. A. OVERSEAS. GREECE AND YOUTH USE OF MONTHLY THAT BIG CAN DEVICES AND MEANT BABY DEVICES. AND A DECREASE IN FRUITS AND CAN BE A SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER SO WE ARE GETTING TO A POINT WHERE YOUNG PEOPLE. ARE SWITCHING TO MEN'S WERE STARTING WITH MINT PRODUCTS. I'M ON THE NECK RIGHT SIDE ZIPPER SHOULD ABOUT BABY PRODUCTS NOT AT NOT G RRECT SO ON THAT ON THE G DE. SO IT IS THERE IS NO STANDARD FOR USE OF NICOTINE REPLACEMENT THERAPY PRODUCTS FOR USE WITH MINORS. THOSE PRODUCTS ARE MARKETED TO MINORS AND SO WHEN WE LOOK AT JEWEL WHO I THINK WE CAN CALL HIM HOW WORK ON THEIR CURRENTLY AGAIN UNDER INVESTIGATION FOR THE PRACTICES OF THE MARKETING THAT THEY DID DO TO YOUTH SPECIFICALLY. AND SO THAT'S A HUGE DIFFERENCE IS THAT I'M ACCESS TO THESE PRODUCTS THEY'RE A LOT MORE ATTRACTIVE TO YOU FAN G OMOTED BY PROVIDERS AND THEN ALSO THE INVASIVE MARKETING OF THESE NEW DEVICES. ON SOCIAL MEDIA SITES AND SPECIFICALLY TO YOU. SO THERE MIGHT POINT IS BACK IN THE DIRECTION OF RESTRICTIONS ON MARKETING EDUCATION TAXATION INCREASED OVERSIGHT AND PENALTIES ALL THOSE THINGS THAT MIGHT. DIAL IN ON. ACCESSING THOSE PRODUCTS MAKE IT MORE SIMILAR TO A NICORETTE PRODUCT THAT'S MORE RESTRICTIVE. ITS AVAILABILITY WOULD ALSO ARE JUST TO FOLLOW UP ON YOUR THOUGHT DOCTOR BRINGS UP AND WE DID NOT DISCUSS THIS AT LEAST NOT THAT I'M AWARE OF AND- PERHAPS SOME OTHER CHURCH MEMBERS DID DISCUSS IT. WAS THE- FOCUSING ON THE NICOTINE CONTENT WHICH I THINK YOU KNOW YOU BRING UP THIS KIND OF EXCESSIVE NICOTINE CONTENT MAY BE WITH ME WE NEED TO FOCUS TAXATION. MORATORIUM PROHIBITION PROVISIONS ON EXACTLY ON THE AMOUNT OF NICOTINE CONTAINED IN A PRODUCT THAT SOME WE HAVE LOOKED AT BUT- DO YOU THINK THAT MIGHT BE AN EFFECTIVE AVENUE TO GO DOWN. I THINK THAT'S WORTH EXPLORING ON THE E. LIQUIDS AND TRYING. TO UNDERSTAND WHAT'S IN THEM AND ALSO. YOU KNOW WE KNOW PEOPLE ARE PRICE RESPONSIVE SO THAT AS- WITH THE CLOSEST WE GOT THAT I KNOW THE BILL THAT I WAS WORKING ON SOME MY COLLEAGUES WE WERE WE WERE. LOOKING AT A TAXATION APPROACH THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN BASED OFF. OF THE NICOTINE. CONTENT IN THE PRODUCT. SO GO BACK AND TAKE ANOTHER LOOK AT THAT. BASED ON YOUR COMMENTS HERE TODAY. I THINK ALSO AT JUST TO NOTE JUST LIKE WITH THE TAR YOU KNOW WHATEVER'S REGISTERING IN THE MACHINE WE STILL NEED TO LEARN WHAT'S ACTUALLY. GOING ON WITH THE HUMANS AS WELL. IN MY FINAL MY FINAL QUESTION I WAS SURE I HEARD YOUR ANSWERS ON PROHIBITION. YOUR FOR A PROHIBITION OR BAND VERSUS REGULAR REGULATION OVERSIGHT TAXES I CAN LAY THAT OUT THERE AND I DIDN'T HEAR YOU GUYS. ANSWER THAT. AS A PROVIDER I'M NOT SURE THAT'S USUALLY MY REALM. AND I'M HERE TO EDUCATE ABOUT THEIR QUESTION LEGISLATURE'S ON YOUR YOU KNOW OPINION GIVEN YOUR INVOLVED WITH ALL WELL I THINK TIME IS TELLING THAT THESE PRODUCTS ARE NOT SAFE AND SO IT'S WORTH. LOOKING AT EVERY ANGLE. THAT WE'RE UNDERSTANDING BEES BUT THE VAPING US A PULMONARY INJURY WE STILL HAVE A LOT TO LEARN THAT. YOU KNOW IF THE CDC IS SAYING TO STOP APING. YOU KNOW WHAT ARE OUR OPTIONS SO. I DON'T KNOW THAT THAT'S CALLED PROHIBITION BUT I THINK IT'S CALLED. HOW DO WE ACT FOR PUBLIC HEALTH. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU WHAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH FEW QUESTIONS FOLLOW UP. I JUST WANT COMMENTED COMMENT AND. MISTER GRANT I AGREE AND DISAGREE ON THINGS AND SO AT THAT MAY OR MAY NOT BE OBVIOUS PEOPLE SAID. THAT'S OKAY BUT- BUT- HE POINT OUT THAT YOU KNOW WE TALKED ABOUT BANNING THE FOURTEEN THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED NINETY SEVEN FLAVORS AND STILL LEAVING OTHERS OUT THERE. BUT MY UNDERSTANDING FROM TOBACCO FREE KIDS IS THAT WHEN YOU LEAVE MEANT AND MENTAL ON THE TABLE. YOU STILL GOT FIFTY PERCENT. THAT'S THE PREFERENCE 450% OF USERS SO THAT'S TO ME IS A IS KIND OF A PROBLEM AND SO. AND THAT'S THAT'S DATA THAT WAS FAIRLY DECENT I CAME OUT IN AUGUST PLEASE SO. THANK MEANT WAS SOME. AND HE HAD MENTAL IN THERE AND THE NUMBER STILL HIGH SO IN OTHER WORDS THAT'S WHY RULE THAT'S WHY MISTER CARTY NINE PARTICULAR LOOKING AT A BAN ON ALL FLAVORS BUT SO BUT- TALKING ABOUT THE FTA AND SAFETY AND PENSION T. CORPSE OR TWO COURSES THAT THE COURSE. IT SEEMS KIND OF COUNTER INTO IT SEEMS COUNTERPRODUCTIVE IT SEEMS WRONG THAT WOULD PUT PASSED THE INDUSTRY TO PROVIDE US WITH SAFETY DATA CONSIDERING. THE HISTORY OF THE INDUSTRY AND HOW THEY'VE BEEN SENT ON TO GO THROUGHOUT TIME. TO THAT BEEN OUT THERE SO. FAIL TO SEE WHY. YES YOU HAVE DAYS PUSHING THAT UP BUT HOW DO WE GET OTHER DATA OUT THERE THAT ISN'T POTENTIALLY BUYS IT FEELS A LITTLE LIKE THE FOX GUARDING THE HEN HOUSE QUITE FRANKLY. AND IT JUST FEELS BACKWARDS ESPECIALLY IN THIS ERA. WITH A HISTORY OF NOT BEING TRUTHFUL ON ON ISSUES WHY WOULD WE THEN. TAKE THE SAME PEOPLE AND HAVE THEM. HAVE THEM YOU KNOW CONDUCT THE RESEARCH AND THAT THEY YOU KNOW. THIS IS THIS IS SAFE. YES WELL THERE ARE A LOT OF CONTRADICTIONS IN THE HISTORY OF TOBACCO CONTROL AND I THINK WORD THIS WHOLE VAPING EPIDEMIC IS MAKING US TRY TO EXAMINE EVERYTHING FROM OF. FROM UP WHAT WE KNOW AND WHAT WE'RE SEEING NOW. I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT THAT SOME OF THESE T. CORES ARE. VERY CAN SERVE AS IN TERMS OF INDEPENDENT REVIEWS SO I'VE HAD COLLEAGUES AT UC SAN FRANCISCO WHERE THERE'S A NEW PRODUCT THAT. CALLED I COAST THAT IS THE HEAT NOT BURN PRODUCT IT'S NOT VAPING IT'S HEATING AND THEY JUST GOT FTA THEY SUBMITTED THROUGH THE FDA APPROVAL TO MARKET. AND THE FOLKS AT THESE CENTERS LOOKED AT THE DATA INDEPENDENTLY AND CAME TO SOME DIFFERENT CONCLUSIONS SO FOR EXAMPLE THIS PRODUCT. THAT HE'S NOT BURNS TOBACCO VERSES REGULAR CIGARETTES WHEN THEY LOOKED AT THE INDUSTRY DATA THEY SHOWED. THERE WAS ACTUALLY. TWO HUNDRED A 1000% HIGHER. OF OVER FIFTY CONSTITUENCIES OUT OF A HUNDRED CHEMICAL CONSTITUENTS IN THIS HEAT NOT BURN PRODUCT COMPARED TO REGULAR CIGARETTES AND EVEN HIGHER. LIVER FUNCTION TESTS LIVER INFLAMMATION FROM BLOOD TESTS THAN REGULAR CIGARETTES SO. I THINK. THESE TWO COURSES THAT ARE HELP TO THAT ARE HELPING THE FTA UNDERSTAND WHAT IS IMPORTANT DATA FOR REGULATORY SCIENCE PLAY VERY CRITICAL ROLES. BUT THEY ARE NOT INDUSTRY THEY'RE TYPICALLY UNIVERSITIES THAT ARE PROVIDING DATA AND ALSO CAN HELP WITH INDEPENDENT. REVIEW OF DATA AS WELL. IN THE INTEREST OF TIME I-DO HAVE SOME OTHER COMMENTS AND ALL AND ALL MONEY HIT ON THEM BUT BUT I KNOW WE'VE GOT A LOT A BIG AGENDA AHEAD OF US HERE THANK YOU WITH REGARDS TO MISTER LOS TALK ABOUT THAT REALLY A SMALL NUMBER OF CITIES AND THAT HAVE ACTUALLY TAKEN ACTION IN A SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME THE FACT IT. ALMOST 10% OF CALIFORNIA CITIES. IN SOME ACTION ON. THANK YOU SIGNIFICANT I THINK YOU'RE GONNA SEE THAT NUMBER GROW. IF THERE IS AN ACTION FOR ME THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OF THE STATE SO I THINK PART OF THAT IS JUST PEOPLE SAY WHAT WE GOT A PROBLEM HERE WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING AND MAYBE IT'S NOT THE RIGHT THING TO DO. BUT IT'S BETTER THAN DOING NOTHING AT ALL AND SO I THINK THAT THAT YOU'RE GOING TO SEE MORE AND MORE OF THAT HI TO HEAR THAT IS LIKE THE NUMBER ONE ISSUE IN SCHOOL BAKING. AND IT ISN'T DISTINGUISH REMAKING TOBACCO INVADING CANNABIS IT'S A BABY IT'S ALL LUMPED TOGETHER IS THE NUMBER IT IS THE NUMBER ONE ISSUE I HEAR FROM FROM PEOPLE. WE HAVE DONE A MARVELOUS JOB ON EDUCATION RELATED TOBACCO I THINK IT SHOWS BYTHE NUMBER OF THE PERCENTAGE AND HOW THAT CAN OF ACTUAL TRADITIONAL TOBACCO USE AND CONTINUE TO GO DOWN. THE START CHANGE BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN AND- EIGHTEEN AND THEN NOW INTO NINETEEN. I GOTTA WONDER IF IT ISN'T JUST BECAUSE OF THE TRENDY LITTLE DEVICE. THOSE ORIGINAL DEVICES WERE PRETTY. KEY AND BIG. AND HARD TO HIDE AND- MOM SEE THAT WHAT THE HECK IS THIS THING. BUT IT'S HARD IT'S A MUCH EASIER TO CONCEAL SOMETHING LIKE LIKE THE JEWEL DEVICES AND SO. THAT MAKES IT COOL AND I WONDER HOW MUCH OF THAT IS AN ISSUE. I THINK NOW WE'RE ALSO WE ARE HEARING NOW THAT. THAT IN THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY ALL CALL IT RIGHT NOW WITH. THE ILLNESSES THAT ARE HAPPENING. KIDS ARE ARE ARE TAKING A MORE CAUTIOUS APPROACH. ABOUT THAT SOME KIDS ANYWAY. FEMALES MORE THAN MALES BECAUSE I THINK. GUYS THING TO THINK THEY'RE INVINCIBLE PERIOD. AND SO I THINK THAT THERE ARE THERE AT THE LEAST. FOR NEW. STARTS AND THOSE THAT. ARE CURRENTLY THERE ARE QUITE A QUALITY. CONTENT. BECAUSE IT'S DICTION IT'S SIMPLE IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE. TO WALK AWAY FROM. I THINK ONE OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE FACE IN EDUCATION CERTAINLY THE CANNABIS SPACES. THE PROMISE OF PROSPECTS BEFORE WAS REVENUE FOR THAT. AND WE HAVE A TIME LAG NOW AND THE REVENUE ISN'T WHAT WE EXPECTED FROM THE TAXES AND SO WE'RE KIND OF. A LITTLE BIT BEHIND THE SCENES ON THAT FROM MY PERSPECTIVE AND WE ARE PROGRAMS EITHER SO MAYBE WE PIGGY BACK OFF OF. THE SUCCESSFUL PROGRAMS THAT YOU'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT BUT THE RESOURCES. TO MOVE THAT HAVE AND HAVEN'T BEEN IS AVAILABLE YEAH. IT IS INTERESTING I HAVE A SON IS NOW TWENTY THREE HE'S HE SAID AND THRUST MIDDLE SCHOOL AND HIGH SCHOOL. THAT CANNABIS WAS MUCH MORE ACCESSIBLE AND MUCH MORE CONSUMED. AND TOBACCO ONCE AND SO THE NUMBERS THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT USAGE DOESN'T SURPRISE ME TOO MUCH BASED ON. THAT AND WHAT I HEAR FROM FROM OTHER FROM OTHER PEOPLE SO. IN IT AS FAR AS TAXATION WHETHER WE ARE IF WE ARE TAXING. CAM NICOTINE PRODUCTS OR CANNABIS PRODUCTS MAYBE EVEN YOU KNOW LABELING YOU KNOW DIFFERENT LABELS AND- YOU KNOW MAYBE WE GO AT SOME POINT TO I THINK THERE'S A ISN'T THERE SOME SORT OF A- IS LIKE A STICKER SOMETHING ON. TOBACCO PRODUCTS ITS STANCE MAYBE GO THAT WAY IT WITH CANNABIS AT SOME POINT. BUT THAT DOESN'T HELP US WITH THE ILLICIT MARKET. AND SO THAT I THINK IS THAT THAT WILL CONTINUE TO BE THAT'LL HELP DISTINGUISH BETWEEN THE TWO MARKETS BUT I DON'T KNOW THAT THAT HELPS US WITH THE OF LISTEN MARKET. UNTIL THERE'S A REPORT SO ANYWAY AS FAR SO IF YOU WANT TO COMMENT I THREW A LOT OUT THERE SORRY. YEAH I WAS A QUESTIONS. THANK YOU FOR COMING TO HAVE YOU VOTE. SO WHEN IT'S ON THE COOL FACTOR OF THESE DEVICES CERTAINLY IT'S VERY COOL WE WORK WITH YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE ENGAGED AND WORKING ON THESE ORDINANCES IN THEIR LOCAL COMMUNITIES. AND THEY HAVE COME IN SHARED WITH US THAT THEY SHY AWAY FROM TELLING THEIR PEERS WHAT THEY'RE WORKING ON BECAUSE IT'S NOT COOL TO BE AN ANTI TOBACCO PERSON RIGHT NOW BECAUSE BIG BEEPING HAS BECOME. THE NORM SO THAT'S AN ISSUE BUT THE ISSUE IS THAT EVEN IF IT WAS JUST A CALL TRANSFER A LITTLE BIT IT'S A COOL TURN WITH THE HIGHLY ADDICTIVE SOLUTION. SO NOW YOUNG PEOPLE ARE DICTATED SO EVEN IF THEY DON'T WANT TO USE ANYMORE AS YOU'D MENTIONED THIS IS AN ADDICTION NOT A HABIT. AND SO NOW WE'RE DEALING WITH SOMETHING THAT WAS COOL WHO HAS CREATED A NEW GENERATION OF NICOTINE ADDICTS SO THAT'S A BIG ISSUE. THE OTHER THING WE'VE BEEN TALKING A LOT ABOUT THE BEING AS THAT'S THE INTENT OF THIS HEARING. BUT ALSO JUST TO NOTE THAT THE FLAVORS THAT WE SAW CIGARETTE SMOKING. GOING DOWN OVER THE LAST MANY YEARS AND MUCH OF. THAT CAN BE A TRIBUTE TO FTA. AND REMOVING THE FLAVORS THAT CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO THE AMAZING WORK THAT'S HAPPENED HERE IN CALIFORNIA. BUT IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT TOBACCO USE OF OTHER PRODUCTS WAS NOT CHANGING OR WAS INCREASING WITH USING ADULTS AND THAT'S EITHER FLAVOR TOBACCO PRODUCTS. AND OFTENTIMES YOUNG PEOPLE WILL SMOKE THEIR MARIJUANA WITH A FLAVORED. CIGAR WRAPPER. AND SO THEY CONNECTION THERE IS. ALL OF THE FLAVOR TOBACCO IT'S NOT SIMPLY FLAVORED NICOTINE SOLUTIONS IT'S AN ISSUE WITH YOUNG PEOPLE. IT'S THE FLAVORING AND ALL OF THE PRODUCTS. SO I'VE SEEN OUR COMMENTS HAVE DRAWN UP MORE QUESTIONS SO. MR MCCARTY AND THEN MR RIVAS YEAH AND WHAT THE FIRST THING ABOUT THE CITY'S I JUST WANT TO MENTION DOCTOR WHAT IS THERE'S 10% RIGHT NOW BUT I WOULD SAY THE POPULATION WISE IT'S PROBABLY CLOSE TWENTY FIVE THIRTY WITH LA SAN FRANCISCO LA COUNTY THE CITY OF LA ON THE VERGE OTHER BIG CITIES AND SO. SOME OF THE RULES ARE DIFFERENT SO THAT'S ONE THING LIKE WE SAW WITH A PLASTIC BAGS IN MENU LABELLING OF ALL THESE JURISDICTIONS WITH SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT LAWS IT'S MASK FUSION FOR CONSUMERS AND THE INDUSTRY PROBABLY I'M NOT LET'S HAVE ONE STATEWIDE A POLICY WITH AN GET SUPPORT FROM THE TAX CAN REGULATION. I GET WHAT YOU'RE WHAT YOU'RE SAYING TERM GRAY BUT THERE'S SOME PRODUCTS THAT YOU KNOW WHEN THERE'S MODERATE USE TAXING REGULATION OVERSIGHT MAKES SENSE LIKE ALCOHOL MODERATE USE WE DON'T TAX IT REGULATES AND HAVE HAVE POLICY FOR COCAINE HEROIN AND METHAMPHETAMINE BECAUSE WE KNOW IT'S UNSAFE FOR ANY. SET SUBSET OF HUMANS THE KIDS ESPECIALLY I THINK THE SAFETY THING IS THE QUESTION HERE AND ONE THING WE HAVEN'T TALKED ABOUT YET ASK YOU LAST QUESTION HERE. IS THAT THE TOBACCO MINOR SETTINGS VERY DIFFERENT IN THIS PRODUCT OF THE NICOTINE THE HIGH DOSAGE HAVE A HUGE IMPACT ON YOUNG PEOPLE IN THEIR DEVELOPMENT THEY'RE STILL THERE DEPRESSION ANXIETY AND BEHAVIORAL ISSUES THERE'S ONE YOUNG MAN THAT SUING TOOL TALKING ABOUT WHAT IT LET LED TO HIS. LIFESTYLE CHANGE AND THAT'S A PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUE THAT HAS COST UPON SOCIETY AND HEALTHCARE COSTS AND SO YOU KNOW THAT PIECE WE HAVEN'T REALLY TALKED ABOUT YET IS THAT THE IMPACT IT HAS JUST ON THE ACTUAL YOUNG PEOPLE'S DID HE MENTION TALK ABOUT THAT FIRST THING THOUGH. YES SO I THINK WHEN THE SURGEON GENERAL'S TALKING ABOUT THE DEVELOPING BRAIN HE'S ALSO ADDRESSING MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES AND I THINK. THAT UP AND IT'S GETTIN MARIJUANA'S AND IT'S NOT TO SAY THE DOES IT'S NOT IMPORTANT. FOR OLDER PEOPLE IT'S JUST THAT. THIS IS ESPECIALLY IN. POURTANT FOR THE NEXT GENERATION SO. I THINK THOSE ARE VERY EXCELLENT POINTS YOU BRING UP UP THAT IT'S NOT JUST WILL HELP THAT. YOU KNOW THESE PULMONARY INJURY CASES ARE. ALARMING BUT THERE'S YOU KNOW IT'S THE WHOLE PERSON THAT WE NEED TO LOOK AT. THANK YOU RIVAS YEAH SO I APPRECIATE THE INFORMATION YOU KNOW I COME FROM. PART OF MY TIME THE ASSEMBLY I WAS SCHOOL DISCIPLINE MANAGER SO I SAW THE SEVEN EMIC RIGHT BEFORE MY EYES I SAW ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING YOU KNOW. AND SO I GUESS IS A VERY COMPLEX ISSUE AND A DISCUSSION WE PROBABLY MAKE IT WORSE BY ALL THE DIALOGUE YOU'VE HEARD UP HERE I MEAN MORE COMPLEX. BUT CERTAINLY SEEMS LIKE A RACING AGAINST THE CLOCK IT SEEMS LIKE THIS EPIDEMIC IS GETTING WORSE DAY BY DAY AND 'VE BEEN BASED ON ALL THIS CONVERSATION UP HERE IT'S YOU KNOW VERY EASY TO GET LOST IN THE WEEDS OF THIS COMPLEX ISSUE. I AND THERE'S OBVIOUSLY A LOT THAT WE DO NOT KNOW. BUT BASED ON WHAT WE DO KNOW WE DO KNOW THAT THERE IS A PUBLIC HEALTH PROBLEM THERE'S A CRISIS RIGHT THAT WE HAVEWAS IT MORE THAN A THOUSAND CASES OF LUNG ILLNESS THAT HAVE BEEN REPORTED. IN PEOPLE UNDER THIRTY FIVE YEARS OF AGE 60% OF THOSE PATIENTS ARE UNDER EIGHTEEN YEARS OLD. 21% ARE BETWEEN EIGHTEEN AND TWENTY YEARS OF AGE AND AS OF THIS MORNING TWENTY NINE DEATHS RELATED TO THIS. AND IN IN YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY AS I MENTIONED EASY TO GET IN THE WEEDS BUSINESS COMES AS WE TALK ABOUT ENFORCEMENT WE COULD TALK ABOUT FLAVORS AND UNFLAVORED WE TALK ABOUT T. C. WE TALK ABOUT. YOU KNOW. THE NICOTINE WE TALK ABOUT TAXATION. BUT THE ONLY THING WE CAN THAT WE REALLY DO KNOW THE ONE THING WE CAN POINT TO. IS THAT THE RELATE THE ONE THING WE COULD POINT TO RELATE TO THE COST OF ALL THE ILLNESSES AND THE DEATHS. IS BABY. THAT ALL REPORTED PATIENTS HAVE A HISTORY OF USING PAPER PRODUCTS RIGHT. AND SO TO ME STANDING UP HERE WE WE'VE GOT ALL THE INFORMATION WE LOOK AT WHAT OTHER STATES ARE DOING WE KNOW WHAT YOU KNOW OUR GOVERNOR DID THROUGH EXECUTIVE ACTION. BUT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT IT ABSENT A COMPLETE VAN OF ALL BABY PRODUCTS THE FLAVOR NOT FAVOR ALL THE PRODUCTS. NOTHING IS GOING TO BE IN IN LESS WE HAVE THAT NOTHING IS GOING TO BE ENOUGH. TO PREVENT FUTURE ILLNESSES INTEL WE ABSOLUTELY KNOW WHAT IS CAUSING THESE ILLNESSES. IT IS SO YOU KNOW. AND TELL YOU KNOW IN IN THE MEANTIME THAT WERE ROLLING OUT ALL THESE PUBLIC AWARENESS CAMPAIGNS THAT WE ARE ADOPTING REGULATIONS AND BUILD A POLICY FRAMEWORK YOU KNOW REGULATORY FRAMEWORK TO ADDRESS THIS CRISIS. YOU KNOW AND FIND THE MOST EFFECTIVE THE SOLUTION OR HOWEVER MANY YOU KNOW ID IS GOING TO TAKE. UNLESS WE HAVE AN ABSOLUTE BAN. IT SEEMS TO ME THAT WE'RE GONNA KEEP READING ABOUT MORE ILLNESSES WE'RE GONNA KEEP READ ABOUT MORE DEATHS. ASIDE FROM THE PUBLIC HEALTH COST IMPACT THE TREATMENT OF SOME OF THESE PEOPLE IS. GOING TO BE ASTRONOMICAL AND I REPRESENT A RURAL AREA. WHERE WE ARE WE KNOW WE LACK HEALTH CARE SERVICES AND SO UNDERSTANDING AVAILABILITY OF TREATMENT. LET ALONE THE COST IS A PROBLEM SO ABSENT SO I GUESS MY QUESTION IS ABSENT A COMPLETE BAN. YOU KNOW THIS IS ONLY GONNA GET WORSE IS THAT TRUE OR NOT TRUE OR YOU KNOW. I DON'T KNOW. I THINK I'LL COMMENT THAT EVERY WEEK MY SLIDES ARE OUTDATED BECAUSE THESE CASES ARE RISING AND THIS IS. THESE ARE YOUNG PEOPLE WHO CAN AND SOME OF THEM AS YOUR NOTING HOSPITALIZED IN THE ICE YOU VERY EXPENSIVE COSTS OF CARE THEY'RE LUCKY THEY'RE YOUNG BECAUSE THEY CAN WALK OUT THE PEOPLE WHO ARE DYING ARE MIDDLE AGED. YOU KNOW HOW DO WE STOP THIS I THINK THIS IS. THIS IS WHY WE'RE COMING TOGETHER TODAY BUT- TO AB ANTICIPATE THE HEALTH PROFESSIONS ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO TAKE CARE OF THIS IT HAS TO BE MORE UPSTREAM. AND AS I THINK EVERYONE'S NOTED TODAY A VERY COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH. YOU KNOW I THINK IT'S THE CAT'S OUT OF THE BAG ALREADY AND YOU KNOW WHAT CAN WE ALL DO TOGETHER. TO HELP CONTROL THE EPIDEMIC. THANK YOU THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH. FOR KICKING THIS OFF. MUCH VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE INFORMATION AND WE'LL GO AHEAD AND. WITHOUT SHERMAN LOW ONE SECOND PANEL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THEN AS WE THEN CLEAR THE TABLE FOR THE NEXT A PANEL OF THE NEXT PANEL IS HOW BEEPING AND ELECTRONIC CIGARETTES ARE REGULATED IN CALIFORNIA. AND WHAT MORE NEEDS TO BE DONE OUR PANELISTS SUSAN FINELLI THE ACTING DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH LAURIE AJAX CHIEF OF THE BUREAU OF CANNABIS CONTROL NICOLAS MADURO'S DIRECTOR FOR THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF TAX AND FEE ADMINISTRATION. KAREN LEAF SENIOR ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL FOR TOBACCO LITIGATION AND ENFORCEMENT SECTION AND THEN FINALLY HERDER KAPUT FOR SENIOR ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL FOR THE CANVAS CONTROL SECTION AND MEMBERS AND COLLEAGUES THAT JUST AS A POINT OF. THEIR VACATION THAT IF IT'S BEEN AN HOUR AND FORTY FIVE MINUTES AND OUR FIRST PANEL DISCUSSION AND I KNOW THAT WE HAVE THIS PANEL AND ADDITIONAL PANEL AFTER THAT FOLLOWED BY PUBLIC COMMENTS SO. I KNOW THAT WILL TRY TO BE VERY DIRECT WITH SOME OF OUR COMMENTS IN THE INTEREST OF TIME TO BE ABLE TO GET AS MUCH INFORMATION AS POSSIBLE SO HAVING SAID THAT. AMOUNT WE FIRST BEGIN THEN IN ORDER. HERE AND WE BEGIN WITH SEASON FINALE PLEASE. GOOD AFTERNOON TEARS TEARS AND MEMBERS I'M SUSAN VALLEY ACTING DIRECTOR FOR THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH I'VE BEEN ASKED TODAY TO SPEAK ABOUT THE ROLE OF THE PART OF PUBLIC HEALTH. IN TOBACCO IN VAPING REGULATION. FIRST I WANT TO START WITH AS YOU'RE AWARE GOVERNOR'S SOME DID ISSUE THE EXECUTIVE ORDER AND GAVE SPECIFICALLY ASKED THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. TO LAUNCH A TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS STATEWIDE DIGITAL AND SOCIAL MEDIA. PUBLIC AWARENESS CAMPAIGN TO EDUCATE YOUTH YOUNG ADULTS AND PARENTS ABOUT THE HEALTH RISKS OF VAPING. DEVELOPING RECOMMENDATIONS TO REDUCE THE VEIL ABILITY OF VAPING DEVICES TO PERSONS UNDER TWENTY ONE YEARS OF AGE INCLUDING THE ESTABLISHMENT OF WARNING SIGNS ABOUT THE HEALTH RISKS OF VAPING. AT BOTH THE IN ADVERTISING AND AT RETAIL RETAILERS. INCREASED ENFORCEMENT REGARDING ILLEGAL SALES OF VAPING PRODUCTS AND SPECIFICALLY E. LIQUID FLAVORS TO YOUTH IN ADDITION SEE THE PAGE WAS CHARGED TO MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS REGARDING THE ESTABLISHMENT OF STANDARDS. FOR NICOTINE CONTENT AND UNIFORM PACKAGING FOR PURPOSES OF INCLUDING NICOTINE CONTENT IN THE CAP CALCULATION TAXES. FOR TODAY NO RECOMMEND HE NO RECOMMENDATIONS HAVE BEEN FINALIZED AT THIS TIME AND WE CONTINUE TO EXPLORE ALL COMPREHENSIVE OP SET OF OPTIONS AS WE LOOK TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE. WE WILL RELEASE AN ADVERTISING CAMPAIGN JUST WAITING YOUNG PEOPLE FROM PEIPING RAISING AWARENESS OF THE NEW OUTBREAK ASSOCIATED WITH VAPING ANDY NORMALIZING ALL TOBACCO USE IN CALIFORNIA. ON THAT CAMPAIGN IS SET TO START NEXT WEEK. AS YOU HEARD THIS MONTH THIS AFTERNOON FROM THE FIRST PANEL THE NUMBERS AROUND USE VAPING ARE VERY CONCERNING IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN THE HIGH SCHOOL SMOKING PREVALENCE IN CALIFORNIA WAS 2% COMPARED 28% NATIONALLY. BUT WE'RE AFRAID THAT PROGRESS IS GOING TO GO THE OTHER WAY AT THE SAME TIME WE'RE SEEING THIS ALARMING RISE IN THE NUMBER OF SCHOOL AGE CHILDREN USING ELECTRONIC CIGARETTES. AND E. CIGARETTES WERE THE MOST COMMONLY USED TOBACCO PRODUCT ON HOW CALIFORNIA HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS EIGHTY SIX POINT 4% OF THE HIGH SCHOOLS TOBACCO USERS REPORT IT USING A FLAVORED TOBACCO PRODUCT. THE COST OF SMOKING CALIFORNIA IS ESTIMATED EIGHTEEN ONE POINT ONE BILLION OR FOUR HUNDRED AND FOUR THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED AND THREE DOLLARS PER SMOKER ALL CALIFORNIANS ARE PAYING THESE COSTS NOT JUST THE SMOKERS. MOST RECENTLY THIS PEIPING OUTBREAK RAISES GREATER CONCERNS FOR YOUTH AS WELL AS ADULTS IN THE NEXT PANEL DR CHARITY DEAN FROM OUR ARE ACTING STATE HEALTH OFFICER WILL SHARE INFORMATION ABOUT THE OUTBREAK AND THE HEALTH IMPACTS. SO NEXT TIME WHEN I TURN TO OUR ROLE IN. REGULATING BOTH TOBACCO AND CANNABIS FIRST OFF I WANT TO START BY EMPHASIZING THAT MUCH OF THE REGULATORY CONTROL IF YOU AS YOU HEARD IN THE FIRST PANEL IS RESIDES WITH THE FEDERAL FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION FOR TOBACCO PRODUCTS.

A CLOSING WE CONTINUE TO WORK THROUGH THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY AND THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE TO ADDRESS THE OUTBREAK AND TO REDUCE YOUTH YOU SOME TO BACK ON CANNABIS PRODUCTS WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING OUR WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE WITH STAKEHOLDERS. TO ADDRESS THE PUBLIC HEALTH CONCERNS THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT TODAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH IT IS ACT. THANK YOU FAIRS AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS IMPORTANT DISCUSSION MY NAME IS LAURIE AJAX AND ON THE CHIEF OF THE BUREAU OF CANNABIS CONTROL. AS ONE OF THE STATE AGENCY RESPONSIBLE FOR REGULATING COMMERCIAL CANNABIS LICENSES INCLUDING DISTRIBUTION MICRO BUSINESSES RETAILERS AND TESTING LABS THE BUREAU OF CANNABIS CONTROLS BEEN CLOSELY FOLLOWING THE OUTBREAK OUTBREAK OF HEALTH ILLNESS IS BEING REPORTED ACROSS THE COUNTRY THAT HAVE BEEN LINKED TO VAPING. THE BUREAU SUPPORTS GOVERNOR NEWSOME'S EXECUTIVE ORDER IN SEPTEMBER TAKING DIRECT ACTION TO ADDRESS THIS PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS. ALL CANNABIS AND CANNABIS PRODUCTS LEGALLY SOLD IN CALIFORNIA MUST COME THROUGH A SUPPLY CHAIN OF ONLY LICENSE CANNABIS BUSINESSES STARTING AT CULTIVATION AND ANY WITH THE SALE TO CONSUMER. THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE ALL LICENSEES MUST COMPLY WITH REQUIREMENTS THAT PUT PUBLIC SAFETY FIRST. THE MOST CRUCIAL PUBLIC HEALTH RELATED STEP IN THE LEGAL SUPPLY CHAIN IS MANDATORY REGULATORY COMPLIANCE TESTING. BEFORE ANY CANNABIS OR CANNABIS PRODUCT CAN BE SOLD BY LICENSED RETAILERS IN CALIFORNIA IT MUST GO THROUGH RIGOROUS TESTING FOR CONTAMINANTS SUCH AS PESTICIDE MOLD HEAVY METALS PROCESSING CHEMICALS RIDGES RURAL SOLVENTS AND OTHER HARMFUL INGREDIENTS. FOR EXAMPLE CANNABIS AND CANNABIS TRUCK PRODUCTS ARE TESTED FOR SIXTY SIX PESTICIDES AND TWENTY RESIDUAL SOLVENTS AND PROCESSING CHEMICALS. IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF PESTICIDE REGULATION THE BUREAU IS SET LEVELS FOR THESE CAN. IT'S THAT CANNOT BE EXCEEDED IN CANNABIS OR CANNABIS PRODUCTS THESE LEVELS ARE SET BASED ON WHAT ARE CONSIDERED A SAFE AMOUNT FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION. ONLY AFTER A TESTING LABORATORIES CONFIRM THAT THE CANNABIS ARE CANNABIS PRODUCT DOES NOT EXCEED ANY OF THESE LIMITS CANNOT BE DISTRIBUTED TO RETAILERS FOR SALE TO CONSUMERS. CANNABIS AND CANVAS PRODUCTS THAT CANNOT MEET TESTING STANDARDS MUST BE DESTROYED. WELL NO SINGLE SUBSTANCE OUR PRODUCT HAS YET BEEN LINKED TO THE CASES INVOLVING VAPING RELATED ILLNESSES IT HAS BEEN REPORTED THAT MANY OF THE CASES INVOLVE THE USE OF THC CONTAINING PRODUCTS PARTICULARLY FROM THE UNLICENSED MARKET. THEREFORE TO ASSIST WITH THE DRIVE ADDRESSING THE VAPING HEALTH ISSUES THE BUREAU IN COOPERATION WITH OTHER STATE EIGHT AND EIGHT ENTITIES IS FOCUSED ON LICENSE ACTIVITY TRACING SOURCES OF VAPING ILLNESSES AND PUBLIC EDUCATION. THE BUREAU THE CANNABIS ENFORCEMENT UNIT WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF TAX AND FEE ADMINISTRATION AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES ARE CURRENTLY WORKING TOGETHER TO IDENTIFY AND SHUT DOWN UNLICENSED RETAILERS DISTRIBUTORS AND MANUFACTURERS. THE CANNABIS ENFORCEMENT UNIT PROVIDES SWORN PEACE OFFICER SERVICE TO INVESTIGATE AND LICENSE ACTIVITY COMPLAINTS RECEIVED BY THE BUREAU. THE BUREAU ON THE CANVAS ENFORCEMENT UNIT ARE WORKING TOGETHER TO PRIORITIZE COMPLAINTS INVOLVING ILLEGAL CANNABIS VAPING PRODUCTS. IN THE LAST SIX WEEKS THE CANNABIS ENFORCEMENT UNITS SERVE TWELVE SEARCH WARRANTS INVOLVE ILLEGALLY MANUFACTURED VAPING PRODUCTS. THE SEARCH WARRANTS WERE SERVED ON UNLICENSED CANNABIS RETAILERS DISTRIBUTORS AND MANUFACTURERS IN CONJUNCTION WITH LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES. DURING THESE OPERATIONS TWENTY ONE THOUSAND POUNDS OF CANNABIS GOOD RECEIVED WITH A RETAIL VALUE OF FIFTY ONE MILLION. THIS INCLUDED THE SEIZURE OF TWENTY THOUSAND VAPE PENS AND VAPE PEN CARTRIDGES. THE MOST RECENT CASE YOU MAY HAVE HEARD IN THE MEDIA IS ABOUT THE SEIZURE OF CUSHY PUNCH PRODUCTS I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT THE SITUATION IS BEING ACTIVELY INVESTIGATED HOWEVER I'M NOT ABLE TO PROVIDE ANY FURTHER DETAILS ABOUT THIS DURING MY TESTIMONY TODAY AS THIS INVESTIGATION IS ON GOING. IN ADDITION TO STOPPING AND LICENSED RETAILERS AND COUNTERFEIT CANNABIS PRODUCTS IT IS CRITICAL TO EDUCATE CONSUMERS ABOUT HOW TO IDENTIFY A LICENSED RETAILER. THE BUREAU'S OVERSEEN A STATEWIDE PUBLIC INFORMATION CAMPAIGN CALLED HASH TAG GET WE'D WEISS. THE CAMPAIGN INCLUDES EXTENSIVE OUTREACH EDUCATING CONSUMERS ABOUT THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH CANNABIS PURCHASED FROM UNLICENSED BUSINESSES AND ENSURING THEY UNDERSTAND THAT ONLY CANNABIS AND CANNABIS PRODUCTS PURCHASED FROM LICENSED RETAILERS HAVE PASSED. STATE REGULATORY TESTING. THE BUREAU IS HIGHLIGHTING HOW A CONSUMER CAN USE THE CA POT CHECK DOT COM WEBSITE TO VERIFY THE BUSINESS IS LICENSE BEFORE MAKING A PURCHASE. THE CAMPAIGN ALSO IS MAKING IT CLEAR TO AND LICENSE BUSINESSES THAT THEY WILL BE PROSECUTED FOR THEIR ACTIVITIES. IN LESS THEY CEASE OPERATIONS OR GET LICENSE. THE BUREAU SUPPORTS THE GOVERNOR'S EFFORTS TO CONFRONT THE YOUTH OF AB AN EPIDEMIC AND ADDRESSES ONGOING PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS. THE BUREAU WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE TO ENSURE THESE PRODUCTS ARE SAFE FOR CONSUMER THANK YOU AGAIN FOR HAVING ME HERE TODAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH NOW NICOLAS MADURO'S FROM THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF TAX AND FEE ADMINISTRATION. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS TO COMMITTEES MY NAME'S NICK MADERA SOME THE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA PROMISED TAX AND FEE ADMINISTRATION CD TFA. IT'S A MOUTHFUL TO SAY THE CALIFORNIA PROPERTY TAX AND FEE ADMINISTRATION SO. CDFA ADMINISTERS ABOUT THIRTY SEVEN TAX PROGRAMS FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA OUR LARGEST IS THE SALES AND USE TAX PROGRAM BUT WE ALSO ADMINISTER THE TOBACCO TAXES FOR THE STATE AS WELL AS THE CANNABIS TAXES. TODAY ALL FOCUS ON THOSE TWO PROGRAMS. I'D LIKE TO FOR STARTUP BY DISCUSSING HOW THOSE TAX PROGRAMS WORK THEN BRIEFLY OUTLINE OUR ENFORCEMENT METHODS AND LASTLY ALL HIGHLIGHTS SOME OF THE CHALLENGES WE FACE AS WE ILLEGAL THEY PRODUCTS BOTH IN THE TOBACCO AT HAND CANNABIS. ROUNDS SO THE TOBACCO TAX PROGRAMS WE HAVE THREE BASIC CATEGORIES OF TAX PROGRAMS WE ADMINISTER SUIT CIGARETTE TAXES TOBACCO PRODUCT TAXES AND SERVE CIGARETTE TOBACCO PRODUCTS LICENSING FEES. LAST YEAR THE DEPARTMENT BROUGHT IN AND ADMINISTERED ABOUT SEVENTY FOUR POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS IN TAX REVENUE OF THAT TWO POINT ONE BILLION DOLLARS. IS RELATED TO THESE TOBACCO TAX AND FEE PROGRAMS. OTHER TOBACCO PRODUCTS WHICH ARE THE NON CIGARETTE TAXES ACCOUNTED FOR ABOUT 13% OF THAT REVENUE WERE TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS IN FY. EIGHTEEN NINETEEN THOSE ARE TAXES DERIVED FROM HISTORICALLY IT WAS CIGARS SMOKING TOBACCO CHEWING TOBACCO AND SNUFF. WITH PROP FIFTY SIX AND TWENTY SIXTEEN. ELECTRONIC CIGARETTES AND VAPE PRODUCTS WERE ADDED TO THAT DEFINITION OF TOBACCO PRODUCTS AND SO ON. IT IS ONLY SINCE THEN THAT WE'VE BEEN. TAXING THOSE VAPING PRODUCTS AS OTP OR OTHER TOBACCO PRODUCTS. WE ESTIMATE THAT LAST YEAR THE TAX REVENUE FROM THOSE PROGRAMS FROM TO FROM VAPING PRODUCTS AMOUNTED TO ABOUT FIFTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS STARTING NEXT YEAR WE WILL HAVE EXACT NUMBERS AS WE'RE CHANGING OUR RETURNS. TO REQUIRE THAT VAPING PRODUCTS BE SEPARATELY LISTED ON THE TAX RETURNS. THE RATE ON T. P. INCLUDING VAPING PRODUCTS IS SET BASED ON THE TOBACCO THE CIGARETTE TAX RATE SO CIGARETTES ARE TAXED AT TWO DOLLARS AND EIGHTY SEVEN CENTS PER PACK IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA NOW STARTED OUT AS THREE CENTS BACK IN THE FIFTIES AND ROB TO TWO EIGHTY SEVEN. WHAT WE DO ANNUALLY IS WE TAKE THAT TWO EIGHTY SEVEN AND WE ADD FIFTY CENTS TO IT SO YOU'RE AT THREE DOLLARS AND THIRTY SEVEN CENTS PER PACK WE DIVIDE THAT BY TWENTY WHICH IS THE NUMBER OF CIGARETTES IN A SINGLE PACK. YOU GET SIXTEEN POINT EIGHT FIVE CENTS AND THEN WE DIVIDE THAT NUMBER EACH YEAR BY THE AVERAGE WAITED COST OF A SINGLE CIGARETTE. THIS YEAR THAT MEANS THAT T. P. INCLUDING ALL OF THESE TO BACK OF EGG PRODUCTS. ARE TAXED AT A RATE OF FIFTY NINE POINT TWO SEVEN PERCENT. NOW ONE. CURIOUS THING ABOUT THE WAY THE CALIFORNIA TAXES ARE SET UP IS THAT THAT AVERAGE WILL STILL COST WHICH IS THE DENOMINATOR IN THE EQUATION. RISES EACH YEAR BECAUSE OF INFLATION. WHICH MEANS THAT THE TAX RATE ON OTHER TOBACCO PRODUCTS ACTUALLY GOES DOWN EACH YEAR. IT IS. TO ME A STRANGE OUTCOME BUT WE HAVE. ANYWAY IN ADDITION TO THAT TAX WE ALSO HAVE THE CIGARETTE TOBACCO PRODUCTS LICENSING PROGRAM WHICH LICENSES ANNUALLY OF ABOUT THIRTY ONE THOUSAND RETAILERS THREE HUNDRED WHOLESALERS AND EIGHT HUNDRED DISTRIBUTORS NOW ON THE TOBACCO SIDE OF THE EQUATION. WE ADMINISTER THE SALES AND USE TAX PROGRAM WHICH APPLIES TO THESE TOBACCO SALES AS WELL AS THE EXCISE TAX AND THE CULTIVATION TAX. LAST FISCAL YEAR THAT ALL OF THOSE PROGRAMS TOGETHER BROUGHT IN ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS AND TO DATE SINCE ADULT. LEGAL CANNABIS. OF THEY'VE HAVE BROUGHT IN ABOUT SIX HUNDRED THIRTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS. THE EXCISE TAX IS AGAIN A VERY COMPLICATED ONE AT THE MOMENT IT'S 15% BASED ON THE WHOLESALE COST. PLUS AND MARK UP RATE THAT CD TFA DETERMINES EACH YEAR WHICH IS CURRENTLY SET AT 60% SO IT'S NOT A 15% ON THE ACTUAL PRICE PAID BY THE CONSUMER. IT COULD BE MUCH LESS THAN 15% IT COULD BE MUCH HIGHER BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY MARK UP THE ACTUAL MARKUP. VARIES IN TRANSACTIONS AND THAT. ANYWAY SO THOSE THE TAX PROGRAMS WE ADMINISTER. HOW WE ENFORCE THEM WE HAVE THREE BASIC METHODS INSPECTIONS INVESTIGATIONS AND AUDITS. WE HAVE TEN INSPECTION TEAMS DEDICATED TO TOBACCO ENFORCEMENT AND NOW. THROUGH B. C. P. LAST YEAR TO ACT CANNABIS ENFORCEMENT AS WELL AROUND THE STATE. THEIR JOB DAY IN AND DAY OUT IS TO DO INSPECTIONS OF RETAILERS TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL THE PRODUCTS IN THOSE STORES IS TAX PAID. IN THE CASE OF CIGARETTES AS WAS MENTIONED EARLIER ALL OF THE TAX PAID MATERIALS HAVE STAMPS THE EVERY PACK OF CIGARETTES IN THE STATE HAS TO HAVE A TAX STAMP AND ACTUALLY THE TAXES PAID WHEN YOU PARK WHEN THE DISTRIBUTOR PURCHASES THAT STAMP AND PLACES IT ON THE- THE- PACK OF CIGARETTES. FOR OTHER MATERIALS. OUR INSPECTORS GO IN AND HAVE TO ASK FOR THE INVOICES AND- THE RETAILERS HAVE TO PROVE TO US THAT THE MATERIAL IS TAX PAID IF THEY CAN'T PROVE IT THEN WE SEIZE THE MATERIAL. IN SINCE JULY OF THIS YEAR OUR INSPECTORS HAVE DONE ABOUT TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED INSPECTIONS. IN THE PAST TWO MONTHS ALONE WE'VE DONE A HUNDRED AND FORTY SIX INSPECTIONS OF VAPING SPECIFIC RETAILERS. OF THOSE HUNDRED AND FORTY SIX WE'VE HAD SEVENTEEN SEIZURES OF PRODUCTS AMOUNTING TO ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND NINETY THOUSAND DOLLARS OF VALUE NOW THAT'S ON THE TOBACCO SIDE OF THE HOUSE ON THE CANNABIS FRONT. WE'VE DONE ABOUT TWO HUNDRED INSPECTIONS SINCE JULY AND PARTICIPATE IN SEVENTY FIVE SEARCH WARRANTS AS AS LAURIE MENTIONED WE PARTNER OFTEN WITH BCC AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS AS WELL AS LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ALL AROUND THE STATE. IN ADDITION TO THOSE VISITS OUR OUTREACH PROGRAM BECAUSE OF THE SCOPE OF THE PROBLEM WE'RE DEALING WITH WE'VE HAD OUR OUTREACH TEAMS AROUND THE STATE ALSO DOING CANNABIS VISITS THEY'VE DONE ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY EIGHT. SINCE JULY AND IN THOSE CASES WE'RE ACTUALLY VISITING NOT JUST PERMIT HOLDERS WERE VISITING AND THE. CANNABIS SELLER THAT WE CAN FIND AND DUE TO SITES LIKE WITH MAPS AND OTHERS. PEOPLE ARE HIDING THEIR RETAIL ACTIVITY. THERE ARE SOME REAL CHALLENGES ON BOTH OF THESE FRONTS AND I'D LIKE TO JUST ADDRESS THOSE VERY BRIEFLY. ON THE TOBACCO SIDE. THE LACK OF STAMPING. OUTSIDE OF CIGARETTES IS A CHALLENGE IT'S MUCH EASIER TO GO INTO A STORE AND SEE THAT. ALL THE PRODUCT IS STAMPED AND ACTUALLY THE STAMPS CONTAIN. INFORMATION OUR INSPECTORS HAVE DEVICES WHICH ALLOW THEM TO READ THE STAMPS AND YOU CAN TELL. WHO THE DISTRIBUTOR WAS WHEN IT WAS DISTRIBUTED A LOT OF BACKGROUND INFORMATION ON. ON EACH OF THOSE. STAMPS. ALSO ON THE VAPING SIDE. THE TAX RATE. IS LOWER I THINK THAN YOU WOULD ANTICIPATE. BECAUSE IT BECAUSE THE TAXES BASED ON THE WHOLESALE COST THE WHOLESALE COST OF SOME OF THESE PRODUCTS IS. RELATIVELY LOW AND SO IF OF APING CARTRIDGE IS THE EQUIVALENT OF ONE PACK OF CIGARETTES IN MANY INSTANCES THE TAX ON A BEEPING CARTRIDGE IS MUCH LESS THAN THE TWO DOLLARS AND EIGHTY SEVEN CENTS TAX ON A PACK OF CIGARETTES SO THAT'S AN ISSUE. WE'RE ALSO SEEING IT YOU KNOW THERE'S A- VERY THERE'S BOTTOM EASE OF MARKET ENTRY IN THE VAPING SECTOR. WE'VE SEEN A. PEOPLE CAN GO ON LINE ORDER MATERIALS FOR THEIR STORES THEY CAN SELL THE NICOTINE LIQUID SEPARATELY FROM THE OTHER LIQUIDS AND PEOPLE CAN MIX THEM AT HOME ONLY THE NICOTINE LIQUID IS TAXED CURRENTLY NOT ANY OF THE OTHER VAPING FLAVORED JUICES IF THEY'RE SOLD SEPARATELY ONCE THEY'RE COMBINED AND IT'S ALL TAX BUT OTHERWISE ONLY THE NICOTINE. THE PENALTIES HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN PRETTY LOW FOR NON COMPLIANCE THAT ACTUALLY GOES ON THE CAñADA SIDE AS WELL. OUR INSPECTORS AT LEAST ARE OPERATING IN A WORLD WHERE THE PENALTIES ARE OFTEN MISDEMEANORS WHERE IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO GET LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT EVEN WANT TO GET INVOLVED IN A MISDEMEANOR CASE AND THE FINES ARE PRETTY LOW. EVEN FOR FAILURE TO LEAD OUR INSPECTORS IN TO RECORD SEE YOUR BOOKS YOU KNOW IT'S A FIVE THOUSAND DOLLAR FINE IF SOMEBODY'S OPERATING ON THE FAR SIDE OF THE LAWN MAKING MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ACTING ILLEGALLY. THE PROSPECT OF MY AUDITOR'S WITH THEIR POCKET PROTECTORS SHOWING UP AND KNOCKING ON THE DOOR AND THE YOU HAVE A POTENTIAL OF BUT A MISDEMEANOR THAT. IN SOME CASES AS MANY REDUCE DOWN TO FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS BY LOCAL COURTS IS NOT A REAL THREAT TO MANY OF THESE FOLKS ON THE CAñADA SIDE THE ILLEGAL MARKET IS VERY LARGE THE WAY WE HAVE TRADITIONALLY APPROACH. ENFORCEMENT IS CUMBERSOME AND SLOW IT RELIES LARGELY ON THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM WHICH IS. SLOW AND DIFFICULT IT'S DIFFICULT TO BUILD THE CASES IT TAKES TIME. WITH THOUSANDS OF ILLEGAL OPERATORS AROUND STATE IT'S NOT I DON'T THINK THAT'S A METHOD THAT SEARCH THE STATE BEST AND WE'RE LOOKING AT OTHER WAYS OTHER THINGS THAT WE CAN DO. AND AS TO WITH TOBACCO WERE ALSO STUDYING STAMPING WE'RE WORKING CURRENTLY ON. A THOROUGH REVIEW IN LIGHT OF THE GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE ORDER WHICH WILL BE PRESENTING TO HIM AT THE END OF THIS MONTH THAT WILL. REVIEW ALL OF THESE OPTIONS AND SEE IF WE CAN'T FIND A BETTER WAY ANYWAY LOOK FOR YOUR QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND FINALLY AT TWO REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE WHEN AND CANNABIS CONTROL SECTION AND ALSO IN THE TOBACCO LITIGATION ENFORCEMENT SECTION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH CARILLO AS WELL AS CHAIRMAN WOULD AND CHAIRMAN GRAY AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS KAREN LIFE I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF ATTORNEY GENERAL HAVE YOUR FOR SERRA. THE I AM THE HEAD OF THE TOBACCO LITIGATION AND ENFORCEMENT SECTION WITHIN THE CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE MY COLLEAGUE HERE HER WINDOW POR IS THE HEAD OF CANNABIS CONTROL SECTION WITHIN THE CALIFORNIA. ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE SO THE TWO OF US ARE HERE TO REPRESENT THE TURNING GENERAL AND. MY COLLEAGUE RENDER WILL BE SPEAKING TO YOU ABOUT THE CANNABIS SIDE OF THE VAPING ISSUES WHILE I WILL. FOCUS MY REMARKS ON THE TOBACCO SIDE. LET ME SAY THAT WE'RE VERY GRATEFUL TO HAVE THIS HEARING BECAUSE IT CALLS ATTENTION TO WHAT WE DO IS A VERY IMPORTANT PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUES. OF OTHERS HAVE ALREADY SPOKEN TO THE SEVERE HEALTH ISSUES THAT HAVE SURFACED WITH THE USE OF VAPING DEVICES IN RECENT MONTHS AS WELL AS THE HUGE SPIKE IN UNDER AGE USE OF ELECTRONIC CIGARETTES I DON'T THINK I NEED TO REPEAT THAT AT THIS TIME. EXCEPT TO REMIND ALL OF US THE ACCORDING TO THE TWENTY NINETEEN NATIONAL YOUTH TOBACCO SURVEY PULMONARY DATA WERE NOW NATIONWIDE A POINT WHERE MORE THAN ONE OUT OF FOUR HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS IS USING ELECTRONIC CIGARETTES THIS IS THE MOST POPULAR. FORM OF TOBACCO USE. AMONG YOUNG PEOPLE TODAY. AND THIS IS FOR A PUBLIC HEALTH STANDPOINT EXTREMELY ALARMING BECAUSE IT THREATENS TO REVERSE MUCH OF THE GREAT WORK IN PROGRESS THAT HAS BEEN DONE OVER MANY YEARS TO REDUCE TOBACCO USE IN THE UNITED STATES. THE PRODUCT THAT KILLS MORE AMERICANS THAN ANY OTHER PRODUCT IT IS THE SINGLE LARGEST SOURCE OF PREVENTABLE DEATH AND DISEASE IN OUR COUNTRY CLAIMING THE LIVES OF FOUR HUNDRED AND EIGHTY THOUSAND AMERICANS. EVERY YEAR. END ALL THIS IS OCCURRED IN THE FACE OF A REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT HERE IN CALIFORNIA AT LEAST WITH RESPECT TO TOBACCO IS FAIRLY ROBUST AND I WILL TURN MY REMARKS TO THAT NOW. UNDER CALIFORNIA LAW ELECTRONIC CIGARETTES ARE CONSIDERED TOBACCO PRODUCTS AS SUCH THEY ARE SUBJECT AS MY COLLEAGUE HERE NICOLAS MADURO SAID TO STATE EXCISE TAXES AND STATE LICENSING LAWS STATE SMOKE FREE LOS STATE UNDER AGE SALES LOANS AND REMOTE SAW SALES LOSS AND I'M SURE I HAVEN'T GIVEN THE FULL LIST BUT IT THERE'S FAIRLY COMPREHENSIVE. REGULATION OF ELECTRONIC CIGARETTES AT THE STATE LEVEL IN ADDITION MANY LOCAL COMMUNITIES OF ADOPTED ORDINANCES TO REGULATE. ELECTRONIC CIGARETTES IN ONE FASHION OR ANOTHER MAINLY THIS COMES IN THE FORM OF LOCAL RETAIL TOBACCO LICENSE ORDINANCES BUT IN SOME INSTANCES IT IS A LEGISLATION THAT IS SPECIFICALLY DIRECTED AT ELECTRONIC CIGARETTES OR FLAVORED PRODUCTS. AT LEAST SEVEN COUNTIES IN MORE THAN THIRTY TWO OF CITIES IN THE STATE REGULATE IN THIS FASHION. AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. ELECTRONIC CIGARETTES ARE REGULATED BUT TO A LESSER DEGREE THE FEDERAL FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION HAS REGULATORY AUTHORITY UNDER THE FEDERAL FAMILY SMOKING PREVENTION AND TOBACCO CONTROL ACT WHICH WAS PASSED IN TWO THOUSAND AND NINE AND UNDER THEIR DEMAND RATINGS. ELECTRONIC CIGARETTES ARE WITHIN THEIR REGULATORY AMP IT HOWEVER. FTA HAS IT HERE TO AN ENFORCEMENT POLICY WHICH HAS ALLOWED ELECTRONIC CIGARETTES TO BE SOLD AND MARKETED IN THE UNITED STATES INCLUDING IN CALIFORNIA WITHOUT GOING THROUGH THE REQUIRED PREMARKET APPROVAL PROCESS BY THE FDA. NOW I'VE SEEN IN NEWS REPORTS TO THE FACT THAT THE FDA IS REVIEWING THAT ENFORCEMENT POLICY AND MAY. CHANGE IT ESPECIALLY WITH RESPECT TO FLAVORED ELECTRONIC CIGARETTES BUT WE HAVEN'T SEEN ANYTHING DEFINITIVE FROM THAT AGENCY AT THIS POINT OF I WOULD NOTE THAT ELECTRONIC CIGARETTES ARE NOT SUBJECT TO FEDERAL EXCISE TAXES NOR OR THEY SUBJECT IS A NUMBER OF OTHER. FEDERAL LAWS THAT APPLY TO OTHER TOBACCO PRODUCTS SUCH AS THE PACT ACT WHICH GOVERNS. INTERESTED INTERSTATE. A NET AND MAIL ORDER SALES OF CIGARETTES AND SMOKELESS TOBACCO OR THE FEDERAL CONTRABAND CIGARETTE TRAFFICKING ACT WHICH GOVERNS SMUGGLING OF CIGARETTES. WITH THAT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OWN ROLE WITH RESPECT TO BACK UP. THIS ROLE DATES BACK. SEVERAL DECADES NOW TO REALLY THE MID A NINETEEN NINETIES WHEN CALIFORNIA AMONG A LARGE NUMBER OF OTHER STATES SUED THE MAJOR CIGARETTE MANUFACTURERS FOR. A HOST OF WRONGDOING BUT MOST NOTABLY THEIR DECADES LONG CONSPIRACY TO DECEIVE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ABOUT THE HEALTH RISKS OF THE PRODUCTS AND THEN TAKE TO DO THIS OF NICOTINE. THOSE LAWSUITS WERE RESOLVED BY THE- MASTER SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT WHICH AT THE TIME WAS THE LARGEST CIVIL SETTLEMENT IN AMERICAN HISTORY. IT IMPOSES A NUMBER OF ON GOING OBLIGATIONS ON THE PART OF THE SIGNATORY MANUFACTURERS PARTICULARLY IN THE AREAS OF ADVERTISING AND MARKETING BUT THEY ALSO OBLIGATE THE MANUFACTURERS TO MAKE PAYMENTS TO THE SUBTLE IN STATES. IN PERPETUITY SO ALONG AS THEY CONTINUED TO MANUFACTURE AND SELL THEIR PRODUCTS. IN THE DOMESTIC STREAM OF COMMERCE. THE CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE HAS HAD A UNIT NOW FOR TWENTY YEARS THAT HAS OVERSEEN. THEIR COMPLIANCE WITH THIS. REALLY LANDMARK AGREEMENT. WE HAVE NOT HESITATED TO SUE INDIVIDUAL MANUFACTURERS WHEN WE THOUGHT THE DAY DID NOT COMPLY WITH THEIR OBLIGATIONS UNDER THAT AGREEMENT SO WE HAVE SUED AND WON ON ISSUES SUCH ISSUES TARGETING AND REACHED AN FREE SAMPLING. WE HAVE OVERSEEING THEIR COMPLIANCE WITH PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS AND THEY ARE SUBSTANTIAL. TO DATE CALIFORNIA HAS RECEIVED SIXTEEN POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IN PAYMENTS FROM THE SIGNATORY MANUFACTURERS. AND IN TWENTY NINETEEN A LITTLE CALIFORNIA RECEIVED JUST SHY OF EIGHT HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IN ADDITION TO MAKING SURE THAT THE COMPANIES THAT ARE PART OF THE MASTER SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT. LIVE UP TO THEIR OBLIGATIONS UNDER THAT AGREEMENT. THE STAFF WITHIN THE CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE AND FORCES A ST PAUL CALLED AN ESCROW STATUTE THAT APPLIES TO THE MANUFACTURERS THAT I'M NOT PART OF THAT SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT. THERE ARE CERTAIN OBLIGATIONS THAT THEY HAVE BASED ON THEIR SALES HERE IN CALIFORNIA WE ARE THANKFUL WE HAVE ANOTHER STATE LAW CALLED THE TOBACCO DIRECTORY STATUTE THAT SHORES UP OUR ABILITY TO ENFORCE BOTH OF THOSE LAWS. THAT LAW OBLIGATES THE TOURNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE TO CREATE AND MAINTAIN A PUBLIC LIST ON OUR WEBSITE. OF ALL THE CIGARETTE MANUFACTURERS AND BRANDS THAT ARE LAWFUL FOR SALE IN THE STATE AN THERE IS A IN SCREENING PROCESS. THE MY STAFF AND I DO WITH RESPECT TO EVERY SINGLE CIGARETTE MANUFACTURER THAT WANTS TO BE LISTED ON THAT DIRECTORY TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAVE SATISFIED THE STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS WHICH INCLUDE. A SHOWING THAT THEY'VE COMPLIED WITH THEIR FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS AND THEIR COMPLAINT WITH OTHER LAWS SO TO STATE LICENSING STATUTES. SO WE HAVE THAT AS A TOOL I CAN TELL YOU BASED ON MY OWN EXPERIENCE THAT IT IS SERVED CALIFORNIA WELL IT IS A GATE KEEPING FUNCTION. THAT HAS BEEN VERY VALUABLE IT AND BEING ABLE TO SURE THE- THE CIGARETTES THAT ARE SOLD IN CALIFORNIA. ARE AWFUL FOR SALE IN CALIFORNIA AND TO MAKE THOSE OUT THERE IN THE FIELD EASILY IDENTIFIED THE VOGUE BRANDS INVOKE MANUFACTURERS WHO THAT QUALIFY AS CONTRABAND. WELL I MUST SAY THE TOBACCO DIRECTORY ALASKA'S COACH YOU DON'T APPLY THE LIKE TONIC CIGARETTES THAT SAID THE CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE HAS BEEN ACTIVE WITH RESPECT TO ELECTRONIC CIGARETTES AMONG. OF OVERSEEING THE COMPLIANCE OF ELECTRONIC CIGARETTE SELLERS THAT SELL OVER THE INTERNET TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE COMPLIANT WITH CALIFORNIA'S STEAK ACT AND OTHER LAWS THAT APPLY TO THEM AND IN TWENTY NINETEEN SO FAR THIS YEAR ALONE WE HAD ISSUED FORTY MORE THAN FORTY WARNING LETTERS TO RETAILERS THAT ARE SELLING THROUGH THE INTERNET. THAT HAVE SOLD TO UNDER AGE CUSTOMERS OR OTHERWISE NOT COMPLIANT WE HAVE ALSO. HAVE NOT HESITATED TO SUIT OF EASTER EGG COMPANIES FOR OTHER FORMS OF WRONGDOING INCLUDING FALSE ADVERTISING AND OF USE TARGETING AND WE HAVE A JUDGMENT AGAINST TO WE ALSO WORK CLOSELY WITH OTHER STATE AGENCIES INCLUDING CITY TFA WE SHARE INFORMATION WITH THEM ABOUT BUSINESSES THAT WE HAVE REASON TO THINK MAY BE OPERATING WITHOUT REQUIRED STATE LICENSES OR POTENTIALLY VIOLATING THEIR OBLIGATIONS TO PAY THE STATE EXCISE TAXES THAT ARE OWED. AND IN ADDITION THE CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE OR MORE PRECISELY ATTORNEY GENERAL BRACERO HAS URGED THE FDA TO STEP UP ITS ENFORCEMENT. WITH RESPECT TO ELECTRONIC CIGARETTES TO ACT MORE AGGRESSIVELY IN THE NAME OF PUBLIC HEALTH. IN EARLIER THIS YEAR ATTORNEY GENERAL THE SERRA ALONG WITH SEVERAL OTHER STATE ATTORNEYS GENERAL URGED THE FDA TO PRIORITIZE ENFORCEMENT OF ALL FLAVORED ELECTRONIC CIGARETTES. ALL SO IT IS THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S ON RECORD. THIS IS AN IMPORTANT AREA OF ENFORCEMENT. I WOULD ADD THE THANKS TO PROP FIFTY SIX THE CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE HOUSE OF NEW ISSUE ROLE. IN SUPPORTING LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT. THE PROP FIFTY SIX AS HAS BEEN NOTED IS AMONG OTHER THINGS INCREASES THE STATE EXCISE TAX ON CIGARETTES AND OTHER TOBACCO PRODUCTS IF YOUR MARKS THE REVENUE FOR A NUMBER OF PURPOSES INCLUDING THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR THAT IS ALLOCATED TO THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE FOR DISTRIBUTION TO LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT. FOR ENFORCEMENT OF STATE AND LOCAL LAWS THAT DEAL WITH ILLEGAL AN UNDER AGE SALES OF TOBACCO SO THERE'S A PARTICULAR FOCUS ON SALES AND USE BY MINORS. MISSILE MAY I ASK YOU TO CONCLUDE YOUR REMARKS THAT WE CAN GET ON TO THE NEXT BE FANTASTIC I'M SORRY THANK YOU VERY MUCH I WAS REALLY JUST ABOUT FINISHED I APPRECIATE YOUR PATIENCE THE PROGRAM HAS FUNDED OF MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED GRANTS TO DATE. AND THAT HAS FUNDED A VARIETY OF LOCAL AGENCIES OF POLICE DEPARTMENT SURE SUPPORT OFFICES LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS MANY OF THEM ARE USING THE GRANT FUNDS FOR A LOT DEALING WITH ELECTRONIC CIGARETTE ISSUES IN THEIR OWN COMMUNITIES SO WITH THAT I WOULD JUST NOTE THAT THERE'S. MORE INFORMATION ON OUR PUBLIC WEBSITE AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH. A GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN GRAY CHAIRMAN LOW AND CHAIRMAN WORD AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR CONVENING THIS HEARING ON AND YOUR LEADERSHIP ON THIS VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE. I AM GOING TO CUT SOME OF MY REMARKS SO IN LIGHT OF THE TIME. AGAIN MY NAME IS FREDERICK ACCORDING TO SENIOR ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL FOR THE COUNT OF THIS CONTROL SECTION IN THE OFFICE OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL THIS IS ONE OF THE NEWER SECTIONS IN THE OFFICE I WANT TO JUST GIVE YOU A LITTLE BIT OF BACKGROUND ON WHAT THE SECTION. WAS SET OUT TO DO. A SECTION WAS FORMED BY ATTORNEY GENERAL THE SERRA INTO TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN. WE REPRESENT A LICENSING AGENCIES THE BUREAU OF CANNABIS CONTROL CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FOOD IN IRAQ AND THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH IN CIVIL AND ADMINISTRATIVE MATTERS WE ALSO WORK WITH INFORMS ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES SUCH AS THE CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY PATROL DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE. STATE WATER AND REPRESENT THEM IN THEIR CANNABIS ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES WE ALSO PROVIDE GUIDANCE TO A NUMBER OF STATE AGENCIES INCLUDING THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS THE CANNABIS ENFORCEMENT UNIT. WE ALSO ADVISE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL ON MATTERS IMPACTING LEGAL COMMERCIAL CANNABIS OPERATIONS IN CALIFORNIA RECENTLY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL SUPPORTED US. HE ACTUALLY HE CONTINUES TO SUPPORT A STRONG REGULATED MARKET AND WITH THIS IN MIND EIJI BUT SERRA RECENTLY SIGNED ON TO SEVERAL LETTERS IN SUPPORT OF FEDERAL LEGISLATION. I NAMELY THE SAFE BANKING ACT AND THE STATE'S ACT IN ADDITION HE PROVIDED SUPPORT FOR COMMENT FOR THE FDA TO ENGAGE IN RESEARCH ON C. B. D. AND OTHER CANNABIS RELATED PRODUCTS. YOU'VE HEARD ALL ABOUT THE REGULAR RATIONS SO I WON'T GO INTO THAT EXCEPT TO SAY THAT CALIFORNIA DOES HAVE A COMPREHENSIVE REGULATION OF CANNABIS CANNABIS PRODUCTS IN CANNABIS SALES. NOW TO REITERATE CALIFORNIA HAS SOME OF THE MOST RIGOROUS STANDARDS FOR TESTING CANNABIS AND CANNABIS PRODUCTS THAT ARE SOLD IN THE REGULATED MARKET PLACE IN THIS STATE. UNFORTUNATELY WE STILL HAVE A VERY LARGE ARMY. THE ONLY CALL MARKET. AND THEY SELL THEY CONTINUE TO SELL PRODUCTS IN THE STATE THAT ARE OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN AND HAVE NOT BEEN TESTED. I AGAIN WILL NOT REPEAT TO THE CDC INFORMATION THAT YOU'VE HEARD SEVERAL TIMES. EXCEPT TO SAY THAT WE NEED TO KEEP IN MIND THAT THE CDC HAS BEEN UNABLE TO LINK THE OUTBREAK TO A SINGLE PRODUCT OR SUBSTANCE. HOWEVER WE WILL ACKNOWLEDGE THAT MOST OF THE PATIENTS REPORTED A HISTORY OF USING T. H. C. CONTAINING PRODUCTS. A FEW ARE REPORTED NICOTINE ONLY PRODUCTS BUT THE CDC ALSO REPORTS ABOUT THE PATIENTS REPORTED THAT THEY DIDN'T PURCHASE THE SEAT TNC PRODUCTS FROM LICENSED REGULATED MARKET PLACES THEY OBTAIN THEM FROM OTHER SOURCES IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN FRIENDS FAMILY MEMBERS. NO ONE KNOWS WHERE THEY CAME FROM. SO AS YOU ALL KNOW PROPOSITION SIXTY FOUR RESULTED IN THE REDUCTION OF MANY. UP AND SAYS I WAS MAKING THE FRACTIONS ARE MISDEMEANORS SO WHEN IT COMES TO REGULATING UNLICENSED MARKET PLACE. IT'S BECOME A LITTLE DIFFICULT FOR OUR PROSECUTORS AND LAW ENFORCEMENT TO PURSUE THESE CASES. AS YOU ALSO KNOW OUT SEVERAL SECTIONS OF THE HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE REDUCED CRIMES TO INFRACTIONS AND MISDEMEANORS. UP THERE REALLY AREN'T TOO MANY FELONIES EXCEPT MAYBE SALE TO MINORS IF YOU CAN ATTACH A FELONY TO ANOTHER OFFENSE FRAUD ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT. YOU HAVE A MORE WEIGHT TO PURSUE A PROSECUTION. THE LEGISLATURE ALSO INCLUDED IN MY CURSOR A- BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS CODE TWO SIX ZERO THREE EIGHT WHICH ALLOW CIVIL PENALTIES OF UP TO THREE TIMES THE AMOUNT OF THE LICENSE FEE FOR EACH VIOLATION OF UNLICENSED COMMERCIAL ACTIVITY AND MOST RECENTLY AS PART OF THE TRAILER BILL YOU ADDED A CODE SECTION BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS CODE SECTION TWO SIX ZERO THREE ONE. POINT FIVE WHICH ALSO PERMITS A LICENSING AUTHORITY TO ISSUE CITATIONS TO LICENSED OR UNLICENSED OPERATORS ARE THE CITATION CAN INCLUDE IN ORDER OF ABATEMENT OUTDOOR ADMINISTRATIVE FINES NOT TO EXCEED FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS PER VIOLATION FOR A LICENSEE AND THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS PER VIOLATION FOR AN UNLICENSED PERSON. AGAIN EACH DAY A VIOLATION CONSTITUTES A SEPARATE VIOLATION. A BY RECENT ESTIMATES 80% OF THE CANNABIS INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA REMAINS UNLICENSED UNREGULATED. WE ARE NOW TWENTY TWO MONTHS INTO LICENSING. ARE THOSE BUSINESSES WE CAN ARGUE THAT INTENDED TO COME INTO THE LEGAL REGULATED MARKET HAVE ALREADY DONE SO OR ARE IN THE PROCESS OF DOING SO BY HAVING OBTAINED PROVISIONAL LICENSE IS SUBMITTED ANNUAL LICENSE APPLICATIONS AND OR SUBMITTED APPLICATIONS TO LOCAL JURISDICTIONS. ARE BASED ON THE VOLUME OF ILLEGAL BUSINESS IS CONTINUING TO OPERATE IN CALIFORNIA ANY MEANINGFUL ENFORCEMENT REQUIRE SUFFICIENT RESOURCES IN COORDINATION OF EFFORTS. I'M IN THE PAST SEVERAL WEEKS WE HAVE HEARD FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS FROM THROUGHOUT THE STATE. WHAT WE'VE HEARD IS WHERE ENFORCEMENT DOES TAKE PLACE IT IS QUESTIONABLE AS TO WHAT IMPACT IT IS HAVING DUE TO THE LIMITED ABILITY OF PROSECUTORS TO TAKE MEANINGFUL ACTION AGAINST THOSE IN THE ILLEGAL UNREGULATED MARKET PLACE. AGAIN CURRENTLY VIOLATIONS OF THE LAW. THAT ARE ONLY BASED ON CAMPUS VIOLATIONS ARE GENERALLY. INFRACTIONS ARE MISDEMEANORS. FOREIGN I'M LEGAL ON REGULATED BUSINESS RUNNING POTENTIALLY THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS AS MR MAJORIS ALSO INDICATED THOSE MINES MAY BE VIEWED AS THE COST OF DOING BUSINESS AND MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN ANY IMPACT ON DETERRING CONTINUED PARTICIPATION IN THE ILLEGAL. UNREGULATED MARKET PLACE. IN MANY INSTANCES RETAIL POP UP SHOPS ARE SHUT DOWN ONE DAY AND WE UP HERE THE NEXT DAY SEVERAL DOORS AWAY. IN ONE RECENT MEETING WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT REPRESENTATIVES THIS WAS DESCRIBES POINT WHAT KAMAL. SO WHILE PROVIDING LICENSING AGENCIES WITH ENFORCEMENT TOOLS THERE REMAINS A GAP FOR MEANINGFUL ENFORCEMENT CRIMINAL AGAIN THE CRIMINAL PENALTIES BEING INFRACTIONS AND MISDEMEANORS FOR UNLICENSED DOWN I'M WANT TO FOCUS ON UNLICENSED ONLY. IT'S NOT HAVING A FACT. THE ATTORNEY GENERAL SUPPORTS BOTH A STRONG REGULATE ACCOUNT OF THIS MARKET AND EFFORTS TO ENSURE THE SUCCESS FOR THE LEGAL MARKET PLACE IN CALIFORNIA AND WE WELCOME THE OPPORTUNITY TO FURTHER DISCUSS HOW THIS CAN BE DONE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THE COMMENTS THAT WERE GIVEN AND THEN AGAIN IT WILL GET INTO A COMMON SING QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS OF THE JOINT COMMITTEE AND JUST AS A REMINDER AT TO COMMITTEE MEMBERS THAT WE STILL HAVE AN ADDITIONAL. PANEL AS WELL AS A PUBLIC COMPANY SO WITH FIRST BEGIN WITH DOCTOR WOULD. THANK YOU VERY MUCH TO ALL OF YOU APPRECIATE APPRECIATE THE INFORMATION AND I CAN SENSE. THAT YOU ARE ALL SOMEWHAT OVERWHELMED BY THE ENORMITY OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE FACE. I DID HERE MISS AGE ACTUALLY TALKED YOU SAID THAT YOU WERE. ACTIVELY WORKING WITH MANUFACTURERS AND RETAILERS AND SO ON I DIDN'T HEAR DELIVERIES ARE YOU ENFORCING AGAINST DELIVERY DRIVERS UNTIL AN ILLICIT DELIVERY OPERATIONS AS WELL. YEAH WHEN WE TALK ABOUT RETAILERS WE. DELIVERY YES I OPPOSE A HUGE NUMBER OF YEAH LICENSE DELIVERIES AND THAT AND I DO WONDER WHERE THEY'RE GETTING THEIR PRODUCTS BECAUSE THERE'S NO STORE FRONT TO TRACE IT BACK TO. IN MANY CASES. WITH REGARD TO THE AND I KNOW YOU CAN'T TALK ABOUT COULD YOU PUNCH THING AND SO I'M NOT GOING THERE BUT IT DOES MAKE ME WONDER HOW MANY OTHER OPERATIONS ARE OUT THERE SO WHEN YOU GUYS ARE SHUTTING DOWN THE LIST OF OPERATIONS ARE YOU TESTING IN THE PRODUCTS THAT COME OUT OF THOSE STORES TO SEE ARE THOSE PRODUCTS IN LINE WITH. CURRENT STANDARDS I WOULD GUESS THAT THEY'RE NOT AND WOOD I KIND OF WELL I WOULD THINK LIKE TO THINK NOT I KIND OF WONDER HOW MANY MORE COULD SHE PUNCHES ARE OUT THERE QUITE FRANKLY WITH WITH THE VALUE OF PRODUCT THAT MAY NOT PASS TESTING AND NEEDING AN OUTLET TO RECOUP. THEIR THE MONEY THAT GOES WITH THAT SO. LITTLE FRUSTRATING THAT WE DON'T HAVE MUCH IN THE WAY OF ENFORCEMENT TOOLS IT SOUNDS LIKE TO. OTHER THAN CITATIONS AND MISDEMEANORS RICHARD HARDLY EVEN A SLAP ON THE WRIST IT FEELS LIKE. I'M CERTAIN THAT WAS MORE OF AN EDITORIAL COMMENT BUT IF YOU HAVEN'T. OBVIOUSLY IF YOU HAVE ANY COMMENT ON THAT. SO DEPENDING ON THE YOU KNOW WE GET MANY COMPLAINTS ON UNLICENSED ACTIVITY AND NOW ESPECIALLY WITH ALL THE MEDIA SURROUNDING THE VAPING CRISIS WE GET A LOT OF COMPLAINTS SO WE WORK TOGETHER WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. AND IF WE FEEL SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE TESTED WE ARE WORKING IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THEM TO HAVE THAT PRODUCT TESTED. WITH REGARDS TO THOSE ARE. MISS MADURO'S FROM CD TFA. SO AS WE TALK ABOUT. THE TAXATION TAXATION. THOSE ARE ALSO SORT OF A SLAP ON THE WRIST AS WELL I THOUGHT. I THOUGHT PEOPLE IN GENERAL KIND OF FREIGHT. ABOUT THE TAX COLLECTORS INFORMER SO. I KNOW I AM I AM VERY CAREFUL ABOUT MY RETURNS AND THINGS. BUT I GOT THE IMPRESSION FEELS LIKE. THAT MAYBE SOME PEOPLE ARE NICE AND SOME IS INDUSTRIE I THINK THAT'S RIGHT I TO HAVE SOMEBODY THREATEN ME WITH A MISDEMEANOR AS A- NERDY MIDDLE AGED FELLOW WOULD BE. AFRAID BUT. ALAS THOSE PEOPLE LEARNING LOTS OF MONEY IN THE ILLEGAL CANNABIS MARKET DON'T SEEM AFRAID AND THAT IN THE TÁI HERE TO THE VAPING IN MY MIND IS THAT. YOU KNOW I WOULD. THE PRODUCTS THAT ARE BEING SOLD THAT ARE UNTAXED ARE ALSO UNTESTED RIGHT AND THAT'S THE REAL I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE. FOR THAT HE'S GOT I THINK THAT'S A THAT'S THE KEY CAN I DO THINK. I IN MY MIND IT IS BOTH THE CRIMINAL SANCTIONS BUT- TO BRING A CRIMINAL CASE TAKE SO LONG. AND IT'S REALLY DIFFICULT WHEN WE'RE- GOT THOUSANDS OF THESE IN MY MIND WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN IS THERE NEEDS TO BE THERE NEED TO BE CIVIL PENALTIES. OR TAX PENALTIES. THAT ARE ALLOWED TO BE PUT ON VERY QUICKLY AND IF THEY'RE PUT ON AN AIR PEOPLE CAN APPEAL BUT- I JUST. THANK THAT EVEN GOING TO A FELONY THE IS NOT GOING TO ADDRESS THE SCOPE OF THE PROBLEM BECAUSE IT WILL TAKE SO LONG TO GET THROUGH THE NUMBER OF ILLEGAL OPERATORS THAT WE'RE SEEING OUT THERE WE ARE TRYING ALL SORTS OF WAYS IN THE TAX FROM INCLUDING ASSESSING TAXES AND TELLING PEOPLE YOU KNOW WE'VE YOU WON'T GIVE US YOUR RECORDS WE'VE DETERMINED THAT YOU OF THE STATE OF MILLION AND A HALF DOLLARS AND- WE'LL- TAKE YOUR HOUSE AND ALL OF YOUR POSSESSIONS AND EVERYTHING ELSE. BECAUSE WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE. BEST WEIGHT I MEAN A THEY DO THE MONEY TO THE STATE BUT WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE BEST WAY TO PROCEED IS AND I'M NOT SURE THAT. WHAT WE'VE ALWAYS DONE. IS WHAT. WILL WORK IN THIS SITUATION. AS I THINK YOU HAVE A PRETTY BIG TOOL BELT BUT NOT A LOT OF TOOLS. THAT'S ONE WAY TO PUT IT. THINKING ALONG ALONG THESE LINES IS. AND THIS IS MORE A QUESTION FOR THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE BECAUSE AND MAKING THIS TO VAPING WHICH IS REALLY WHAT THIS IS ABOUT BUT THIS IS BRINGING UP SOME OTHER ISSUES THAT ARE OF CONCERN I THINK THE CHAIRMAN GRAY AND I WERE COMMENTING TO GET TOGETHER TWENTY TWO MONTHS INTO THIS AND WE HAVE 80% OF THE MARKET UNLICENSED. IS PRETTY APPALLING AND IT'S ROOM IN IT I WOULD IMAGINE FOR THOSE PEOPLE IN THE LICENSE MARKET IT'S PRETTY IT'S PRETTY FRUSTRATING EXTREMELY FRUSTRATING TO KNOW THAT THEY'RE PLAYING BY THE RULES AND WE'VE GOT THIS AND I UNDERSTAND IT AND IT FEELS LIKE ALL OF YOU HAVE TOOL BELTS AND NOT ENOUGH TOOLS AND NONE OF RESOURCES IT'S A BY THE TOOLS. AND SO ON SO IT IS A CHALLENGE SO I WANT TO ASK A QUESTION AND I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER AND SO IT BUT I AM CURIOUS AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT HOW THIS EQUATES IN THE REST OF THE WORLD SOMEONE TO ASK THE SAME QUESTION. IF WE WERE TO FIND THAT THERE WASAN ENTITY OR SOMEONE WHO WAS ADDING SOMETHING TO THE VAPING LIQUIDS THAT WAS CAUSING THIS OUTBREAK. THAT HAS CAUSED GREAT BODILY HARM. AND DEATH IN SOME CASES. WE'VE TO DECRIMINALIZE SO MUCH AROUND CANNABIS. WHAT WHAT THE RECORDS FOR THE H. E. B. WITH THEIR HOW WOULD YOU PROSECUTE THAT CASE OR WOULD YOU BE ABLE TO PROSECUTE IT BASED ON. WHAT IN THE ROLE OF THE LAWS UNDER PROP SIXTY FOUR. I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER I'M JUST AYE BUT I'M CURIOUS. THE REASON I SAY THAT I WOULD BET THAT IF YOU WERE GROWING LETTUCE OR SPINACH SOMEWHERE. AND YOU DID SOMETHING IN THE ADDED SOMETHING THERE. AND PEOPLE DIED ACROSS THE UNITED STATES THE YOU'D BE PRETTY RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT AND A WHOLE NUMBER WAYS SO. IS THIS INDUSTRY GOING TO BE THIS HAVE THE SAME LEVEL OF RESPONSIBILITY AS THE LETTUCE INDUSTRY. OR THE SPANISH INDUSTRY. OR TYLENOL OR ANYTHING ELSE OUT THERE BUT BECAUSE IT ADDED A PRODUCT TO SOMETHING THE CAUSE GREAT BODILY HARM AND DEATH. WELL AS I INDICATED IF YOU CAN ATTACH A CANNABIS VIOLATION TO SOMETHING ELSE CAN IT BECOMES A FELONY SO I THINK IN THE CASE OF A DEATH YOU CAN ATTACH IT TO A DIFFERENT LAW THAT WOULD CREATE. A FELONY VIOLATION. IT WOULD JUST BE A YOU KNOW UP A MANUFACTURING CANNABIS VIOLATION ANYMORE IT WOULD BE SOMETHING MORE THAN THAT. THOUGH IT WOULD BE REQUIRED TO SOMEBODY IS SOME AT. SOME ENTITIES OR WHATEVER WERE FOUND TO BE ADDING SOMETHING THAT BECAUSE THIS. WHETHER KNOWINGLY OR UNKNOWINGLY I MEAN CREATING A PUBLIC HEALTH HAZARD. WELL I THINK YOU WOULD DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN KNOWINGLY OR UNKNOWINGLY ISN'T ONE OF THEM. OBVIOUSLY NO THERE ATTY RIGHT OUT OF THE CONSEQUENCES. YEAH THERE WOULD BE CONSEQUENCES ABSOLUTELY. OKAY JUST LIKE IT WOULD BE FOR LETTUCE GROWERS. WELL OR OR YOU KNOW AT A CULTIVATOR WHO USES SAT DEADLY PESTICIDES AND CULTIVATION IN A TIE RETURN VITAL MENTAL HARM OR- SOME OTHER FELONY CRIME AND PURSUANT BOKEH OUR OUR IS THE ARE THERE CASES BEING PURSUED WERE WITH CULTIVATORS HERE USING. BANNED PESTICIDES AND THAT HAVE BEEN CAUGHT. BECAUSE THEY GET NOW YOU'VE LINKED THOSE THINGS ARE THOSE CAN OTHER CASES ACTUALLY BEING. BEING PROSECUTED NOW OR OR. CHARGED OR OR THOSE MISDEMEANORS. WELL MY OFFICE IS REVIEWING SEVERAL CASES I REALLY CAN'T COMMENT ON WHAT WE WILL END UP CHARGING. BUT WE ARE AS I SAID WE DO OUR WORK IN CONJUNCTION WITH STATE WATER AND DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL WILDLIFE. AND BECAUSE THOSE ARE ENVIRONMENTAL THOSE ARE DIFFERENT LOTS OF PEOPLE HAVE TO CORRECT THEY HAVE ABOUT WATER CODES YOU CAN ATTACH. OKAY I THANK YOU. IT'S A GREAT. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN LOW. I WILL DO MY BEST TO CONDENSE SOME OF THESE QUESTIONS I MAY PROVIDE SOME QUESTIONS TO THE PANEL IN WRITING POST COMMITTEE BECAUSE- THERE'S A LOT I WANT TO GET INTO AND I KNOW. IN THE INTEREST OF TIME ALL TRY. GET TO THE KEY POINTS AS I SEE THEM. I'M A START OVER HERE WITH THE PART OF PUBLIC HEALTH. DURING THE PROCESS OF CONSTRUCTING A BE SIXTEEN THIRTY NINE WHICH LEGISLATION MYSELF AND SEVERAL MY COLLEAGUES AND SERVICE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE WORKED ON. WE BROUGHT IN THE PART OF PUBLIC HEALTH WE BROUGHT IN A. B. C. AND TALKED ABOUT WHAT STING OPERATIONS ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES WERE CURRENT. WHEN THE A. B. C. CAME IN IT WAS SUCH A 354-040-5000 STING OPERATIONS ERRATICALLY INVOLVED ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN NGUYEN DPH CAME IN. THEY SAID WE DON'T KNOW. AND THEY TOLD ME ALL WORK WE'RE ISSUING GRANTS TO LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ASKED HOW MUCH MONEY WAS IT DIDN'T SEEM SIGNIFICANT MY IMPRESSION. BUT I'M LEFT FOR THIS PART PUBLIC HEALTH IS NOT DOING MUCH FOR ENFORCEMENT THEIR TOBACCO THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND THE FRANKLY THE GRANTS WERE GIVEN LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT VERY IN TASTING FOR LOCAL AW ENFORCEMENT TO GET INVOLVED IN. WHAT'S YOUR RESPONSE TO MY IMPRESSION. WE HAVE ABOUT FOUR THOUSAND VISITS TO RETAILERS EVERY YEAR OF THOSE IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN WE HAVE THREE HUNDRED FORTY FIRST TIME VIOLATIONS WHICH ENDED UP IN SUSPENSION OF LICENSE AS TEN SECOND TIME VIOLATORS AND ONE THIRD TIME BY LATER ON AT THE LOCAL LEVEL WE REALLY DO MORE AND OF THE TRAINING OF LAW ENFORCEMENT OF WHAT. THEY WOULD DO I DON'T HAVE INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT. SPECIFICALLY THE NUMBER OF LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT VISITS BUT I CAN TRY AND GET THAT FOR YOU. WELL CERTAINLY I THINK WE NEED IF YOU DON'T NEED TO FIND OUT AND WE NEED TO GIVE YOU THE TOOLS YOU THE FINE AND CONDUCT MORE STING OPERATIONS BECAUSE IT'S- AGAIN WE DON'T NEED TO REINVENT THE WHEEL WE KNOW THAT WHAT WE DO IN THE AREA ABOUT COST CONTROL EFFECTIVE. LAW ENFORCEMENT KNOWS HOW TO DO THIS I THINK PART OF THE PROBLEM IS THAT WE HAVE THE ENFORCEMENT ANY NON LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY. BUT NONETHELESS. I THINK WE MAKES AN IMPROVEMENT THERE BUT I'LL BE HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOU AND I'D LIKE SOME FEEDBACK WHEN I PROVIDE THE LEGISLATION AND- WHICH IS WERE TAKING. SECONDLY. ACTUALLY YOU MAY HAVE ANSWERED HOW MANY. LICENSES WERE RIVER REMOVED THERE WERE NO LICENSES REMOVE THERE IS ONE THAT COULD HAVE BEEN REMOVED EXCEPT THAT THE BUSINESS SHOT DOWN SO IT WAS NO LICENSES REMOVED RIGHT. OKAY FROM THE STATE LEVEL I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT THE LOCAL LEVEL UNDERSTOOD I'M GONNA MOVE ON NOW TO APPEAR OF CANNABIS CONTROL. I WANT TO BEGIN WITH THE FLAVOR ISSUE. I RECENTLY VISITED DISPENSARY TO TAKE A LOOK AT. A DISPATCHER FROM A FLAVOR VIEWPOINT. AND. I'M A GO AHEAD AND READ YOU SOME OF THE FLAVORS THAT WERE DISPLAYED ON THE BOARD OF MARIJUANA BANANA SPLIT BLUEBERRY MILKSHAKE WEDDING CAKE ICE CREAM CAKE. KEY LIME PIE. PUNCH IT BETTER BREAST. SO I'M CURIOUS AS TO YOUR PERSPECTIVE GIVEN THAT FLAVORS ARE A MAJOR CONCERN FOR SOME MY COLLEAGUES AS IT RELATES TO E. CIGARETTES. WHAT'S THE PERSPECTIVE ON THESE FLAVORS IF EASTER FLAVORS ARE DRIVING TEENAGE CONSUMPTION AND AN UNDERAGE CONSUMPTION THAT I WOULD ASSUME. THAT IS TRUE WITH MARIJUANA BUT ARE THERE NO RESTRICTIONS. SO EIGHT A LOT OF THOSE COULD BE ALSO STRAINED NAMES THAT THEY USE IT'S NOT ALWAYS NECESSARILY FLAVORS ON THE DO YOU HAVE A CANNABIS TERPENES. BUT MOST THE TIME WHAT WE SEE THOSE ARE STRAIN NAMES AND SO WE DO LOOK AT ESPECIALLY FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH SIDE. YOU KNOW ANY PACKAGING CAN'T BE ATTRACTED TO CHILDREN ON THE CAN ADVERTISE TO CHILDREN BUT FOR MOST OF THESE THOSE WOULD BE CANNABIS FLOWER WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AND SO. RESTRICTIONS ON PACKAGING AGAIN WOULD BE STILL CAN'T BE ATTRACTED TO CHILDREN. NOW WHETHER OR NOT THOSE NAMES REPRESENT A FLAVOR OR A STRAIN I THINK AS FAR AS WE TALK ABOUT MARKETING THE NAME OF A PRODUCT IS IN FACT MARKETING. AND DOES CERTAINLY AT LEAST STRIK ME AT FIRST BLUSH AND I'M GONNA TRY TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THIS AS DIRECTED TOWARDS YOUNG PEOPLE OR PERHAPS. PERHAPS NOT MAYBE THE FLAVORS AREN'T THE KEY ISSUE I'M SURE THEY OPEN THAT WE'VE BEEN. DEBATING THAT ALL YEAR LONG. HOW MANY. CANNABIS LICENSE HAVE BEEN. SUSPENDED OR REMOVED THIS PAST TWENTY TWO MONTHS. SO MOST OF OUR LICENSES AT THE BUREAU ARE PROVISIONAL LICENSES SO WE ISSUE WE ISSUE A VARIETY OF DISCIPLINARY WE CAN GIVE AND IF WE GO INTO A RETAIL INSPECTION AND WE FIND VIOLATIONS WE CAN ISSUE A NOTICE TO COMPLY WE CAN ALSO SUSPEND OR WE CAN ALSO REVOKE. WE WE'VE GOT WE'VE DONE SOME SUSPENSIONS LIKE FOR EXAMPLE FOR A SALES TO MINOR THAT WE HAD WITH THE LIVERY OF A LICENSED A RETAILER MOST OF THE TIME WE ARE TRYING TO GET OUR RETAILERS OR ANY OF OUR LICENSEES TO COMPLY WITH OUR REGULATIONS IF THERE'S A PUBLIC SAFETY ISSUE THEN WE WILL REVOKE THE LICENSE OR IN SOME CASES AND SPLIT LICENSEE WILL CANCEL THEIR LICENSE OR- OF WHAT NOT SO WE'VE HAD SEVERAL OF THOSE I DON'T HAVE THE EXACT. NUMBERS BUT I CAN CERTAINLY PROVIDE THOSE TO YOU. THANK YOU AND HOW MANY. STING OPERATIONS HAVE BEEN CONDUCTED ON UNDER AGE PURCHASES. SO THAT'S HANDLED BY THE SWORN LAW ENFORCEMENT PART OF THE BUREAU UNDER THE CANVAS ENFORCEMENT UNIT AT THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS AND I CAN CERTAINLY. GET THOSE FOR YOU TO AS WELL. OKAY WELL WAIT FOR THOSE. ANSWERS AND I'LL HAVE SOME FOLLOW UP. DEPART OF TAX AND FEE ADMINISTRATION. I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY AS A- YOUNG STAFF LEGISLATIVE STAFFERS IN THIS BUILDING TO WORK ON THE TAX STAMP PROGRAM WORKING WITH DAN GOVERNMENTAL RELATIONSHIP OR DRUM PORTENT AND MY UNDERSTANDING I HAVE A FALL THAT PROGRAM THE YEARS IS THAT IT'S BEEN A PRETTY EFFECTIVE IN ADDRESSING BLACK MARKET SALES OF TOBACCO PRODUCTS AND I WANT TO GET YOUR TAKE ON. I THINK IT HAS BEEN EFFECTIVE IN IN CIGARETTES WHICH IS ALSO APPLIES TO IN ADDRESSING BLACK MARKET SALES THAT'S. THE CARD TAKES ME TO MY NEXT QUESTION WHICH IS. IN A IN ARBIL THAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING OUR WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO. MOVE IN THE DIRECTION OF A TAX STAMP PROGRAM FOR VAPING PRODUCTS OR E. CIGARETTE PRODUCTS KNOWING THAT IT WAS EFFECTIVE IN DEAL WITH THE BLACK MARKET CRUCIAL BACK OR ONE WOULD ASSUME WE COULD ACCOMPLISH THE SAME THING WITH THE CIGARETTES. DO YOU SEE WHAT HURDLES CHALLENGES TOOLS ARE NEEDED IN ORDER TO ACCOMPLISH THAT WELL I DON'T THINK WE COULD JUST SORT OF LIFT AND SHIFT WITH THE SAME TAX STAMPING REGIMEN THAT WE HAVE THEIR INTO VAPING FOR A FEW REASONS ONE. CIGARETTES ARE ALL TAX TO TWO DOLLARS AND EIGHTY SEVEN CENTS PER PACK THE TAX ON OTHER TOBACCO PRODUCTS. IS BASED ON THIS WHOLESALE COST CALCULATION SO IT'S NOT YOU COULDN'T SELL JUST A SINGLE VALUE STAMP AND SAY THAT THAT'S YOUR STAMP FOR EVERY PRODUCT IF YOU WANTED TO BE AN ACTUAL TAX STAMP. THE OTHER ISSUE IS THAT THE PACKAGING ON THESE OTHER PRODUCTS THE SIZE THE NUMBER OF ITEMS CONTAINED IS ALSO NOT THE SAME WITH CIGARETTES EVERY SINGLE PACKAGE TWENTY CIGARETTES. AND THERE ARE MACHINES THAT ARE DEVELOPED THAT OPEN THE- BOXES AND STAMP EVERYTHING. AND IT BECOMES VERY EFFICIENT. THAT SAID. THE IN MY MIND IS THAT ONE OF THE MAJOR THINGS THAT COULD BE ADDRESSED YEAR IS TRACING WHERE THE PRODUCTS CAME FROM AND ENSURING THAT ITS TAX PAID AND INSURING THAT IT'S NOT A COUNTERFEIT PRODUCT AND THOSE COULD BE ACHIEVED WITH WITH A STAMP THAT IS REQUIRED THAT IS NOT NECESSARILY A STAMP THAT THE DISTRIBUTOR BUYS FROM US FOR A CERTAIN TAX AMOUNT ALTHOUGH THAT'S POSSIBLE BUT YOU WOULD HAVE TO HAVE VARYING VALUES SO IT IS A LITTLE BIT MORE COMPLICATED BUT I DO THINK AND THIS IS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THE GOVERNOR'S ASKED US TO LOOK AT THAT WILL BE REPORTING OUT TO HIM. LATER THIS MONTH ON THAT THAT IT'S POSSIBLE TO DESIGN A SYSTEM THAT WOULD ACCOMPLISH THAT I WILL ALSO SAY THAT I BELIEVE. THAT INITIAL GETTING THE CIGARETTE TAX TAX STEP UP AND RUNNING TOOK I THINK THREE YEARS. WHICH IS A LONG TIME I'D ALSO LIKE TO COME UP WITH SOMETHING THAT WE COULD DO MORE QUICKLY. THE DOES THE SAME ISSUES WE WERE STRUGGLING WITH AN A. B. SIXTEEN THIRD I WAS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO. FAST TRACKED THE- THE TAXPAYER PROGRAM AS RELATES ALTHOUGH FAR ENOUGH THE ISSUE. THAT STALLED ARE LEGISLATION IN THE STATE SENATE THIS YEAR. IT WAS IN FACT THE ISSUE YOU RAISED ON EQUIVALENCY. AND I RELEASE LANGUAGE IN EARLY AUGUST. THAT ATTEMPTED TO CREATE A MORE QUIBBLING TAX BETWEEN TRADITIONAL TRACKING SIX THAT WE WERE GOING TO PUT INTO A. B. SIXTEEN THIRTY NINE. WHEN THE SENATE FOUND OUT ABOUT THAT THE SENATE RULES COMMITTEE REFUSED TO GRANT US A HEARING. ON THE LEGISLATION IS THEY DON'T WANT TO ADDRESS A ATTACKS AT THIS TIME. BUT WILL BE COMING BACK FIRST THING IN THE YEAR TWO STILL WORK ON THAT ISSUE AND I'M TO PROVIDE. YOU THE LANGUAGE THAT WE HAVE TO GET YOUR FEEDBACK. AND ALSO LIKE. SOME ADDITIONAL FEEDBACK ON THE ISSUES YOU RAISED ABOUT A NON COMPLIANCE WITH TAXES AND HOW WE MIGHT ASSIST IN AMPING UP THE PENALTIES ARE NO CHAIRMAN WOULD RAISE THAT AND I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING WE'D ALL LIKE TO. HAVE SOME POTENTIAL SOLUTIONS ON YOU KNOW THAT CERTAINLY CAN BE A VERY EFFECTIVE. METHOD OF ADDRESSING BLACK MARKET ACTIVITIES. I WILL BE HAPPY TO PROVIDE YOU ANY. ASSISTANCE WE CAN. TAKE A LOOK AT THE EQUIPMENTS ATTACKS THAT I PROPOSED IN AUGUST AND SEE IF SEE IF THAT MEETS. THE MARK YES OKAY. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. THE THING THAT CONCERNS ME THE MOST I I'VE GOT ABOUT SIX QUESTIONS HERE BUT THE THING THAT YOU RAISED ON THE INCONSISTENCIES IT YOU KNOW A IN THE WAY RETRIEVES DIFFERENT PRODUCTS AND THE AND THE PENALTIES AND TOOLS AVAILABLE TO YOU TO ENFORCE RIGHT AND HOW THAT WAS A AS I UNDERSTOOD IT. MADE FURTHER DIFFICULT BY SOME OF THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORMS THAT THIS BODY IN THE STATE HAVE ENACTED IN THE PAST YOU KNOW DECADE. ARM IS AN ACCURATE DEPICTION OF WHAT YOU SAID. YES EXCELLENT. SO I'D LIKE TO SEE SOME RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE DOJ AND FROM OUR TRADE GENERAL ON. WHAT STEPS THE LEGISLATURE CAN TAKE TO GIVE YOU THOSE TOOLS SO AS TO HAVE PROPER ENFORCEMENT I THINK MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES WILL BE INTERESTED IN THAT AS WELL. WITH THAT ARE. I WILL DO MY FOLLOW UP WITH ALL OF YOU AND PROVIDE YOU THE DRAFT LANGUAGE THAT WE HAVE PREPARED THAT'S GOING TO BE A CONSISTENT APPROACH TO VAPING TOBACCO AND MARIJUANA. AS WELL AS ENFORCEMENT YEAH I THINK I THINK WE HAVE THE KNOW HOW YOU MAY NOT ALL HAVE ALL THE TOOLS YOU NEED BUT WE NEED TO KNOW WHAT THOSE TOOLS THAT ARE MISSING ARE AND THEN WE NEED TO GET A CONSISTENT. APPROACH TO ALL OF THESE PRODUCTS BECAUSE WHAT WE'RE DOING NOW IS. YOU KNOW THERE'S CERTAIN LEGISLATORS. IN THIS BUILDING WHO WERE. HI IT WITH ONE HAND BANNING FLAVORED TOBACCO AND WITH ANOTHER HAND ENCOURAGING US TO SMOKE MARIJUANA AND MOVING VEHICLES WHAT WE NEED TO GET A MORE CONSISTENT POLICY HERE THERE'S SOME REAL INTELLECTUAL DISHONESTY WITH WHICH WE'RE DOING IN THIS AREA AND I THINK WE NEED YOUR ASSISTANCE AND I THINK A LOT OF ISSUES HAVE BEEN RAISED HERE TODAY. THE DON'T MAKE A LOT OF SENSE AND NOT WE NEED TO GET ON THE SAME PAGE SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY ALTERNATE BACK TO GERMAN Là THANK YOU VERY MUCH IT'S GREAT AND NEXT UP AND MISTER MCCARTY HELD BY MISTER COOPER. I THINK IN THE INTEREST OF TIME I PREFER GOING TO THE NEXT PANEL PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICER GOV GREAT THANK VERY MUCH PHYSICAL. I AGREE WITH MISTER CHRIS BODIES IT CONSISTENT AT BEING INCONSISTENT REALLY THE BILL IS MEAN NOTHING SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE MISDEMEANOR FIVE THOUSAND ARE FINE THAT'S THE SAME WITH SOME OF BREAKING A WINDOW SOMEONE'S WIND OR DO A LOT JOB IT'S A MISDEMEANOR NO ONE'S GOING TO JAIL COUNTY JAIL IT'S BEEN A TIME FOR MISDEMEANOR BUT TIMES PLEA BARGAINING COURT. THE FINAL BE A THOUSAND DOLLARS A FIVE OR DOLLARS THAT'S REAL THAT'S REAL REALITY SOUL WHY NOT DO IT I MEAN YOU'VE A LOT OF GOOD BUSINESSES THAT ARE FOLLOWING THE LAW AND THAT ARE PREDICTED BUSINESSES WE HAVE THAT THAT ELEMENT TO GO DEAL WITH AND JUST LIKE BUT COULD SHE PUNCH WE HAD ONE FOOT IN THE LEGAL AND ONE FROM THE BLACK MARKET. YEAH WE TRY TO DO WITH ALL THE TIME WE ARE 60% OF MARIJUANA CALIFORNIA GOES OUT OF STATE GROW HOUSES SACRAMENTO'S GROW EL CENTRAL IN THE ENTIRE COUNTRY SO WHAT WHAT'S WHAT'S FRUSTRATING FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT THEY'LL DO A POWER SURGE WERE BECAUSE OF POWER USAGE HIT THE HOUSE DO WITH ELECTRICITY WHERE'S. MOTOR P. JEANNIE WILL. AND THE LEAVE THE MARIJUANA IN THE HOUSE. SEE THE ONE THOUSAND SOUTH THE PLAN THROUGHOUT THEIR- LIVES PLANS MAKE IT BACK IN THE BLACK MARKET. SO HOW DO WE CHANGE THAT. I HAD A BILL AND SEVENTEEN. THAT WOULD ADDRESS THIS. IT DID WITH THE CIVIL FUNDING FOR THE STATE AGENCIES. CAN HELP THESE DEVELOP LEGITIMATE CANNABIS BUSINESSES. THAT BILL. WAS GONNA DIE IN PUBLIC SAFETY. BECAUSE YOU CAN'T GET ANY THESE BILLS OUT OF PEOPLE TAKING EITHER HOUSE. THAT'S REALLY WHAT IT COMES DOWN TO. AND IT IS CRAZY SOME OF THINGS THAT GO ON WITH THIS. IT'S A BIG ISSUE. SO WE SHOULDN'T FEEL THE BABY OUT WITH THE BATH WATER. BUT HOW WE DO IT. THESE FOLKS THROUGH THE BLACK MARKET. YOU FIND THEM AND PUNISH THEM. BECAUSE IT LASSEN MINISTRATIONS THAT HEY WE'RE NOT SIGNING ANY LAW THAT PUTS ANYBODY IN JAIL OR PRISON. GOT A NEW GOVERNOR. I'M EXCITED ABOUT HIM AND I WANT THANK HIM FOR LIKE HIS TEAM TO COME OUT HERE. AND RIVER LAW ENFORCEMENT TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT. HOW THEY CAN SOLVE THIS PROBLEM HOW CAN HOW TO ATTACK IT SO HE'S- HE'S BEEN COLLABORATIVE AND. HEALTHY WILL SEEM MORE BIG THINGS IN THE GOVERNOR. MORNING LISTEN CITATIONS THEY DON'T CARE YOU MAKING SO MUCH MONEY. I'M TALKING THE BLACK MARKET LEGAL MARK A BLACK MARKET. IN THE BUSINESS TO MAKE MONEY. BY SELLING. PRODUCT IN THE MORE YOU MAKE THE MORE YOU GO SO IT'S WORTH IT FOR THE PENALTY THERE'S NOTHING. IT'S LIKE NO HARM NO FOUL. WANNA KEEP GOING YOU'RE MAKING TENS OF THOUSAND DOLLARS. EVERY DAY WHY WOULD YOU STOP THAT. BUT THIS LEGISLATURE. RIGHT NOW THERE'S NO PENALTIES FOR ANYTHING. THEY DON'T WANT TO ASSN FORFEITURE. AND SO THESE GUYS ARE MAKING BIG BIG MONEY. AND YOU HAVE TO USE ASSET FORFEITURE LESS THIS DOESN'T WANT TO DO THAT. SO HOW DO WE CHANGE THAT. HOW DO WE GET IT DONE. HOPEFULLY THEY DEAL COME OUT AND- AND HELP WITH SOME OF THAT BUT I DO HAVE A QUESTION. FOR MR MADERO'S. ON THE- WE SELL TO A WITH THE ISSUES. EXCUSE ME TRUE. AS FAR AS THE OPEN THEY'VE SYSTEM THAT GOES UNTAXED. HOW HOW DO WE CHANGE THAT. WELL FOR THE. NON TOBACCO ELEMENT OF THE VEIL I. ONE COULD CHANGE THE DEFINITION OF TOBACCO PRODUCTS TO INCLUDE THAT THOSE OTHER LIQUIDS OR IF YOU WENT TO NICOTINE BASED TAX THAN WHATEVER THE NICOTINE CAN. PORTION IS WOULD BE TAXED AT PRESUMABLY A FAIRLY ROBUST RATE AND SO IF YOU MIXED IT IT WOULDN'T MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE BECAUSE YOU'RE JUST TAXING THAT NICOTINE PORTION BUT NOT AT THE SAME CALCULATION NUMBER USING CURRENTLY IN FROM IS A JACKSON YOUR OPINION HOW BAD IS IT KILL THIS BLACK MARKET IMPACTING LEGITIMATE. CANNABIS BUSINESS. WELL IT'S PROBABLY THE EXCELLENT NUMBER ONE COMPLAINT THAT WE GET THE COMPLAINTS COMING INTO THE BUREAU IS THE LICENSE MARKET AND HOW IT'S DIRECTLY COMPETING WITH OUR LICENSEES AND I THINK. WE ALL AGREE WITH YOU THAT ENFORCEMENT IS. A TOP PRIORITY AND WE ALL WORK TOGETHER VERY WELL TO COMBAT THAT AND PARTNER TOGETHER TO MAKE SURE WERE ATTACKING THE LEGAL MARKET BUT- IT THERE THERE THERE IT IS VERY PREVALENT HERE DO YOU HAVE SUFFICIENT RESOURCES. I THINK BETWEEN ALL OF US WORKING TOGETHER AS A STATE WE HAVE WE DO HAVE SUBSTANTIAL RESOURCES I THINK WE'RE STILL LEARNING THE SCOPE OF THE PROBLEM AND AGAIN WE FEEL IT'S A TOP PRIORITY ONE OF THE THINGS THAT YOU FOR. ALL OF US COLLABORATE AND IT'S NOT JUST THE PEOPLE AT THIS TABLE IT'S WITH US CDFA AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT IS BEING HUGE WITH ASSISTING US WITH SOME OF THESE. ON YOU KNOW SERVING THE SEARCH WARRANTS AND- BUT WHAT ABOUT YOUR RESOURCES AT BCC. A WE HAVE RESOURCES YOU KNOW WE'RE STILL FILLED SUFFICIENT. WE'RE STILL BUILDING OUR OUR STRUCTURE SO. OKAY SHOT THERE I'VE NEVER HEARD IN THE DEPARTMENT HEAD IN MY FIVE YEARS HERE CONFORMS. IN SAY NO WITHOUT SEVERE RESOURCES BECAUSE WE KNOW THEIR BOSSES SO I GET THIS YOU DON'T WANT TO DIS YOUR BOSS LIKE I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU WANT TO BE. WILL BE POLITICALLY CORRECT BUT THAT'S A BIG ISSUE AND I'LL BE OFF WITH ONE THING. THE STATE. THE PAY SUCKS SO WHEN GOVERNOR BROWN GOT IT BE ANY PROGRESS CLOCKING FOR SMITH THERE'S A LOT OF EXPERTISE HERE THAT IS GONE THAT'S BEEN GONE THERE'S NO EXPERTISE WITH THAT. SO NOR OVERNIGHT AS FIFTEEN YEARS. SO THIS LONGTIME DEVELOP EXPERTISE SO MOST FOLKS FROM LOCAL AGENCIES THAT HAVE THAT EXPERTISE SO THE STATE IT'S TOUGH TO DO THAT. THE PAY SUCKS. IN WITH PEPPER YOU KNOW IT'S IS VERY DIFFERENT AS THE CITIES AND COUNTIES SO THAT'S THE TOUGH PART YOU DEAL WITH IT'S FINE THE FOLKS THAT ARE CAPABLE THAT CAN DO IT SO. TO ME IT GOES BACK TO LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT TELL THOSE FOLKS BEING ABLE PART OF THIS TO DEAL WITH THIS HAVE THE EXPERTISE THAT NEED THE FUNDING THERE. TO MAKE THESE INVESTIGATIONS AND DO THEM. WE'VE GOT THOUSANDS OF ILLEGAL. STOREFRONTS LA WITH THE RIGHT RESOURCES THEY CAN DO IT. THAT ALSO CHANGING IT ON THE JUST WHEN YOU GET A MARIJUANA ARE YOU READY TO MARIJUANA. WHATEVER FLOWER WHATEVER THEY CALL IT. DUE TO STRUCTURE. RIGHT AWAY. AS REASON LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES. CANNABIS OUR FLOWER WHATEVER. IS BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO STORE IT. AND YOU GET THOUSANDS OF PLACES TO OUR WAREHOUSE FOR A YEAR OR SIX MONTHS WHATEVER IT. IS NOT FEASIBLE AS FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT AND TAKE IT. VERSUS HAVING AN IMMEDIATE DESTRUCTION ORDER. YOU DESTROY THAT IN ALL THE IMPLEMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT. IF YOU'VE GOT A DOCTOR'S NOTE THAT WOULD LEAVE YOUR ELEVEN PLANTS. WE'RE TAKING EVERYTHING ELSE. SO IT IT'S GOT A CHANGE THAT. UNTIL THIS BODY. GETS OFFICE BUT. NOTHING'S GONNA CHANGE THIS WHATSOEVER HE STARTS THE LEGISLATURE AND WE CAN'T GET A HIT BILL FOR HEARING. THE DAM COMMITTEE THAT'S THE PROBLEM. THAT IS A PROBLEM YOU HAVE GREAT BILLS THAT COME THROUGH THAT A REASONABLE NOT CRAZY STUFF. BUT THEY DON'T WANT TO HEAR IT SO THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IN THE IN THE COMMITTEE SO. THAT'S REALLY WHAT IT COMES DOWN TO. YOU KNOW. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MISTER COOPER. A DOCTOR WOULD. YEAH JUST REALLY BE THIS WAS A THANK YOU I KNOW I FEEL LIKE YOU. YOU YOU KNOW I'VE I SOUND HARSH AYE AYE AYE BUT I'M REALLY. APPRECIATE THE WORK YOU'RE DOING I FEEL LIKE YOU PROBABLY FEEL LIKE YOU'RE SWIMMING UPSTREAM ALL THE TIME AND- AND YOU KNOW WE GAVE. WE GAVE THE INDUSTRY TOOLS TO BECOME INTO COMPLIANCE. WE GAVE TIME FOR PEOPLE TO COME INTO COMPLIANCE AND IT'S FRUSTRATING THAT 80% OF THE- THE INDUSTRY HAS CHOSEN NOT TO DO THAT. AND THAT WE DON'T HAVE THE TOOLS TO ENFORCE AGAINST THAT. IN A IN IN IN A MORE EXPEDITIOUS WAY MAYBE THAT'S THE RIGHT WAY TO SAY IT. I DON'T I DON'T KNOW BUT IT FEELS LIKE IT FEELS LIKE. IT'S LIKE WELCOME ALL. PROBABLY IN IN SOME PLACES AND- AND YOU KNOW IT'S UNFAIR TO THE FOLKS THAT HAVE GONE THROUGH ALL THE HOOPS AND TO DO IT RIGHT. SO I THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING YOU YOU ALL ARE DOING. AND THE BEFORE I GET IN THE ANY OF FINAL CLOSING COMMITTED TO. ANY OF THE FIVE OF YOU WISH TO. SHARE ANY OBSERVATIONS OUR RESPONSES TO ANY OF THE DIALOGUE THAT WAS PREVIOUSLY MADE ON THIS DICE. SEEN ON NO OKAY. I ALSO WANT TO ECHO THOSE COMMENTS IN THE DEEP APPRECIATION AS A DOCTOR WOULD AND NUMBER OF MY COLLEAGUES ON THE WORK THAT YOU ARE DOING. PLEASE INTERPRET ARE COMMON TO SAYING THAT WE WANT TO BEST UNDERSTAND HOW TO BEST EMPOWER AND EQUIP YOU WITH THE TOOLS NECESSARY IN THE RESOURCES NECESSARY. TO BE TO DO THE JOBS THAT YOU KNOW IS IMPORTANT TO DO FOR THE LARGEST REGULATED MARKET IN THE WORLD ARGUABLY. A SIMILE ALONG THOSE LINES IT'S CLEAR THAT YOU OF ALL STATED SOME DEFICIENCIES IN THE AREAS OF OPPORTUNITY AND THE LOST OPPORTUNITIES. THAT YOU'VE HAD. AND WOULD LIKE TO TELL YOU TO HELP CREATE A GREATER SENSE OF URGENCY YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT THE LACK OF ENFORCEMENT A SLAP OF ON THE WRIST. COMMENTS LIKE JUST IN NORAL. MODES OF OPERATING PROCEDURE FOR MANY OF THESE INDIVIDUALS. BUT TO COME TO US AND SAY THIS IS WHAT WE ARE SEEING A WE NEED THIS STORY THE LEGISLATIVE SUPPORT TO BE ABLE TO TACKLE THESE ISSUES. IT'S ALSO CLEAR TO ME THAT THERE ARE NUMBER OF VARIOUS ENTITIES THAT OVERSEE THIS OF ENFORCEMENT AND WITHIN CANNABIS VAPING ALIKE. WE ALSO TALK ABOUT LOCAL CONTROL. AND STATE CONTRACTS STATE A POSITION AS WELL A PERHAPS MY COLLEAGUES MAY ALSO JOIN ME IN EXPLORING THEN PERHAPS A CONSOLIDATION INTO DEPARTMENTAL STATUS. TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE A UNIFORM APPROACH TO SOME OF THESE AREAS SO WE HAVE A SENSE OF CONSISTENCY ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY. SO THAT WE CAN HAVE A SENSE OF HOW WE ARE TACKLING THIS ALL IN ONE HOUSE AS WELL TOO SO THE EFFICIENCIES. I THINK AS MISTER COOPER ALSO MENTIONED IS VERY IMPORTANT. A SIMILE ALSO WANT TO MAKE A POINT THAT WE OFTEN TIMES IN THIS LEGISLATIVE BODY. HAVE SOUGHT TO TRY AND ADDRESS MANY THESE DIFFERENT ISSUES. IN FACT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THAT OF LOCAL CONTROL CITY SAYING THAT WE WANT TO MAINTAIN LOCAL CONTROL WHEN IN FACT I SAY AGAIN. CITIES ARE NOT IN CONTROL THERE ARE UNLICENSED DISPENSARIES OPERATING. ALL THE TIME YEAH AND MANY DIFFERENT PLACES AND SO WHEN WE THEN SAY LET US HELP OPEN UP THE REGULATED MARKET. FOR BILL PROPOSAL ON COMMENSURATE LE. THIS IS ON A. B. C. LICENSES IN. CITIES THAT BILL DOES NOT PASS. WE ALSO SAW A BILL PROHIBITING DELIVERY THAT BUILDS NOT PASSED WE SAW A PIECE OF LEGISLATION TO LOWER. EXCISE TAX THAT DID NOT PASS. SO WE ARE ATTEMPTING TO DO WHAT WE CAN. ABOARD I THINK IS. GOING TO BE HELPFUL IS IF YOU HELP PROVIDE US OF THE SPECIFICS AND SAYING THE JUSTIFICATION IS VERY CLEAR. WHICH ARE WHO I WOULD SUGGEST ARGUE BUT IT LEAVE IT TO PUBLIC COMMENT THAT IS ACTUALLY IN UNISON. TO THAT OF WHAT YOU'RE HEARING FROM INDUSTRY WHICH IS WE THE REGULATED AND THE INDUSTRY THAT IS REPRESENTED IN THIS AUDIENCE. ALSO SAY WE WANT TO JOIN IN LOCKSTEP WE ARE WILLING TO PAY OUR TAXES WE WILLING TO PAY FOR THESE. WE KNOW WHO THE BAD ACTORS ARE WE WANT TO BE IN THE REGULATED MARKET. BUT THEY FEEL LIKE. THEY ARE NOT SURVIVING. AND NOT ONLY IS THAT THAT INDIVIDUALS ARE DYING AS WE ALL KNOW BUT SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS ARE ALSO DYING. AT SO. THERE NEEDS TO BE A GREATER SENSE OF URGENCY SO. WE IMPLORE YOU TO HELP CREATE THAT. SENSE OF URGENCY FOR US BECAUSE WE WANT TO WORK WITH IN THE STATE BUDGET TO HELP GIVE YOU MORE. TOOLS AND RESOURCES AND PEOPLE WE ALSO WANT TO CHANGE LEGISLATION TO HELP EMPOWER YOU SO THAT YOU CAN GO AFTER THE BAD ACTORS ALIKE. UP AND THEN ALSO MESSAGE VERY CLEAR TO THE ADMINISTRATION. OF THAT THIS IS AN INFORMATIONAL HEARING THAT HAS ENGAGE WITH BROAD PUBLIC SUPPORT OF ALL STAKEHOLDERS. TO THAT WHEN YOU SEE PIECES OF LEGISLATION. THAT COMES FROM US THIS IS GETTING THE ADMINISTRATION INVOLVED AND STAKEHOLDERS ALIKE. SO AGAIN WE WANT TO WORK HAND IN HAND WITH EACH AND EVERYONE OF YOU. I YOU PROVIDE AS A SOME GOOD TOOLS AND RECOMMENDATIONS LIKE. A BUT AGAIN WE NEED TO CREATE A GREATER SENSE OF URGENCY FOR THIS BECAUSE- THIS IS OF IMMENSE IMPORTANCE TO NOT ONLY PUBLIC HEALTH. BUT THE FUTURE. THAT WILL TRANSCEND BEFORE LONG BEFORE LONG AFTER WE WILL WE WILL BE HERE. SPECTER OF THESE CHAIR DO SO AGAIN DEEP APPRECIATION FOR ALL. OF YOUR COMMITMENTS AND WE LOOK FOR TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH YOU AGAIN. THANK YOU. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN LOW END AT THANK YOU AGAIN. AT THIS TIME WE'RE GOING TO MOVE TO THE FINAL. PANEL TODAY WHAT AT THE HEALTH EFFECTS ASSOCIATED WITH VAPING AND ELECTRONIC CIGARETTES OF WHAT MORE NEEDS TO BE DONE WITH WELCOME DOCTOR CHARITY DEAN ASSISTANT DIRECTOR ACTING STATE PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICER FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH IF YOU COULD. COME UP AND PRESENT YOUR TESTIMONY PLACE. WELCOME. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRS AND MEMBERS I'M DOCTOR CHARITY DEAN ACTING STATE PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICER AT THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO PROVIDE AN UPDATE ON THE VAPING ASSOCIATED PULMONARY INJURY. THE CURRENT STATUS OF THE BABY OUTBREAK IS ALARMING. NATIONALLY THERE HAVE BEEN ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED NINETY NINE CASES AND AT LEAST TWENTY SIX DEATHS. THE NATIONAL CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION REPORTS 76% OF PATIENTS SELF REPORT USING THC. TODAY NEW DATE IT WAS POSTEDON THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH WEBSITE CD PH DOT CA DOT GOV AND I'M GOING TO DISCUSS IT. WE'VE HAD A HUNDRED AND THIRTY THREE CASES IN CALIFORNIA THREE DEATHS THE MEDIAN AGE OF CASES HAS BEEN TWENTY SEVEN. ALL OF THOSE CASES HAVE BEEN HOSPITALIZED. OF THOSE 43% REQUIRED CARE IN THE INTENSIVE CARE UNIT AND 28% REQUIRED MECHANICAL INTUBATION. SEVENTY EIGHT OF THOSE CASES HAVE BEEN INTERVIEWED THIS MEANS THAT THEY SELF REPORT TO THE PERSON INTERVIEWING THEM WHAT THEY USE AND WHERE THEY OBTAINED THE PRODUCT. THE CASE IS REPORT VAPING OR DABBING MOSTLY CANNABIS PRODUCTS AND WAXES OILS AND OTHER FORMS. OF THE SEVENTY EIGHT INTERVIEWED UCB D. 47% USE NICOTINE. MOST USE A COMBINATION OF THESE AND ONLY 10% REPORTED USING ONLY NICOTINE. THERE WAS ONE CASE THAT DID SELF REPORT PURCHASING FROM A CONFIRMED LICENSED RETAILER MANY ASPECTS OF THAT ARE BEING INVESTIGATED AND THAT INVESTIGATION IS STILL ONGOING. THE REMAINING CASES WHO SELF REPORTED DURING THE INTERVIEW STATED THAT THEY HAD PURCHASED THEIR VAPING PRODUCTS FROM ILLICIT STREET VENDORS. POP UP SHOPS. SOCIAL CONTACTS OR UNVERIFIED SELLERS AND BY UNVERIFIED SELLERS WE MEAN RETAILERS THAT EITHER COULD NOT BE LOCATED OR COULD NOT BE VERIFIED AS HAVING A LICENSE. THERE ARE MULTIPLE PATTERNS OF LUNG INJURY WHICH ARE EMERGING BASED ON THE MEDICAL FINDINGS FROM TISSUE BIOPSIES AUTOPSIES AND BLOOD WORK. MANY OF THESE ARE NOW EMERGING IN PUBLISHED LITERATURE. I'M GOING TO LIST A FEW THE YOU MAY HAVE HEARD OF IN THE MEDIA EXHAUSTION A SLIGHT PUEDEN AMMONIA. THE THEORY BEHIND THAT WAS IT AND HAILING VAPORIZED OILS CAN CAUSE THIS CLINICAL SYNDROME. THAT CAN BE SEEN ON SOME OF THE CLINICAL SPECIMENS LIKE LONG WASHINGS. CHEMICAL PNEUMONITIS OR CHEMICAL INHALATION INJURY. ACUTE EOSINOPHILIC PNEUMONIA BRONCHIOLITIS OBLITERANS DIFFUSE ALVEOLAR DAMAGE DIFFUSE ALVEOLAR HEMORRHAGE ALL OF THESE INVOLVE ACUTE LUNG INJURY AND INFLAMMATION SO YOU CAN SEE THAT THERE ARE NOW A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT CLINICAL SYNDROMES THAT ARE EMERGING NOT JUST ONE. THE CHALLENGE THERE IS THAT MULTIPLE PATTERNS OF LONG INJURY SUGGEST MULTIPLE MECHANISMS WHICH IN TURN SUGGESTS THAT THERE MAY BE MULTIPLE DIFFERENT CAUSES DIFFERENT CHEMICALS LEADING TO THIS NOT JUST ONE. EXTENSIVE LABORATORY TESTING IS BEING DONE NATIONALLY THERE ARE PUBLISHED AND ANECDOTAL REPORTS FROM LABS AT THE FEDERAL AND STATE LEVEL. ALL OF THEM AGREE THAT AT THIS POINT THERE IS NO SINGLE DEVICE SUBSTANCE PRODUCT OR DEVICE TYPE THAT HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED AS THE CAUSE OF THE OUTBREAK. VITAMIN E. ACETATE HAS BEEN RECOVERED FROM SOME PRODUCTS BUT NOT ALL. THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH I RECEIVED A HUNDRED AND FORTY SIX CARTRIDGES ARE PODS WHICH WERE VOLUNTARILY SURRENDERED BY PATIENTS AND THE EXTENSIVE TESTING IS ONGOING. THERE ARE MANY UNKNOWNS ONE I WOULD HIGHLIGHT IS THE UNKNOWN OF WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU MIX CHEMICALS TOGETHER HEAT THAT MIXTURE AN AEROSOLIZED IT. WHICH MAY CREATE NEW TOXIC COMPOUNDS THE EFFECT OF WHICH ON THE LONG TISSUE IS UNKNOWN. ANOTHER UNKNOWN ARE VARIABLES INTRINSIC IN THE DEVICES THEMSELVES HEATING ELEMENTS BATTERIES REFILLABLE CARTRIDGES AND METALS AND AGAIN THE COMBINATION OF THESE WITH HEAT MAYBE CREATING UNKNOWN SUBSTANCES THAT WE DON'T EVEN KNOW TO TEST FOR. THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH HAS HAD A ROBUST RESPONSE TO THIS OUTBREAK. THE MEDICAL AND HEALTH COORDINATION CENTER WAS ACTIVATED IN AUGUST IT IS NOW ACTIVATED AT LEVEL TWO. WE HAVE ISSUED THREE K. HAD ALERTS STATEWIDE. MULTIPLE HEALTH ADVISORIES INCLUDING TO THE PUBLIC AND TO HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS. WE ISSUED A PRESS RELEASE AND HAVE BEEN VERY RESPONSIVE TO MEDIA INCREASE. FROM THE BEGINNING FROM AUGUST FROM THE FIRST DAY WE'VE COLLABORATED WITH OUR NATIONAL PARTNERS AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL WITH THE CDC WITH OTHER STATES THAT WERE REPORTING CLUSTERS WITH OUR LOCAL HEALTH JURISDICTIONS AND WITH PROVIDERS IN CALIFORNIA. ACROSS OUR DEPARTMENT MULTIPLE CENTERS HAVE BEEN INVOLVED THEY HAVE ALL COME TOGETHER TO OFFER STAFF AND EXPERTISE TO RESPOND. I SPECIALLY WANT TO MENTION THE WORK OF OUR STATE PUBLIC HEALTH LABORATORIES WHERE IT'S BEEN A TEAM EFFORT TO SYNTHESIZE AND TEST VARIOUS CHEMICAL HYPOTHESES. DESCRIPTION OF THE EMERGING CLINICAL SYNDROME INCLUDES RESPIRATORY SYMPTOMS SUCH AS COUGH SHORTNESS OF BREATH CHEST PAIN. ANGIE I SENT SYMPTOMS INCLUDING ABDOMINAL PAIN NAUSEA VOMITING DIARRHEA BUT IT ALSO INCLUDES FEVER FATIGUE AND WEAKNESS. PATIENTS PRESENT WITH LOW OXYGEN LEVELS WHICH IS WHY MANY OF THEM NEED TO BE IN THE INTENSIVE CARE UNIT WITH SUPPLEMENTAL OXYGEN THEY HAVE AN ABNORMAL CHEST X. RAY MANY HAVE AN ABNORMAL CT SCAN AS WELL SHOWING BILATERAL INFILTRATES ON BOTH SIDES OF THEIR LINES NOT JUST ONE. THE UNKNOWN I'M SORRY THE LONG TERM HEALTH EFFECTS ARE UNKNOWN BECAUSE THIS IS AN EMERGING CLINICAL SYNDROME WE'RE LOOKING VERY CAREFULLY AT WHAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW. BUT WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THESE PATIENTS LEAVE THE HOSPITAL HOW QUICK IS THEIR RECOVERY WILL THEY HAVE LIFELONG ADVERSE HEALTHEFFECTS ON THEIR LUNGS. WE DON'T KNOW THAT YET. ONE OF THE CHALLENGES IS THIS IS A DIAGNOSIS OF EXCLUSION WHICH IS WHY I MENTIONED THE SYMPTOMS. IN ORDER TO MAKE THE DIAGNOSIS OF A BABY CASE YOU HAVE TO FIRST RULE OUT INFECTIOUS CAUSES OR OTHER POSSIBLE CAUSES. THIS WILL BE A CHALLENGE DURING UPCOMING INFLUENZA SEASON. SO HOW DO WE FIND THE CAUSE. THE PUBLIC HEALTH APPROACH TO THIS AS IT IS TO MANY OTHER OUTBREAKS IS A COMBINATION OF EXAMINING THE EPIDEMIOLOGY DATA. THE CLINICAL SYNDROME THE COURSE OF ILLNESS IN THE PATIENT. THE PATIENT'S CLINICAL SPECIMENS AND OF COURSE A LABORATORY ANALYSIS OF THE VAPING PRODUCTS THEMSELVES. AND IT WILL BE THAT INFORMATION DOVE TAILING TOGETHER THAT WILL GET US CLOSER TO AN ANSWER. IT COULD TAKE YEARS FOR THE MEDICAL AND SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY TO DEFINITIVELY DETERMINE WHAT THE CAUSES ARE. PUBLIC HEALTH RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE PUBLIC ARE IMPORTANT AND WE'VE BEEN SHARING THEM IN OUR PUBLICLY SHARED A PRESS RELEASE AND HEALTH ALERTS NUMBER ONE. WE RECOMMEND THAT THE PUBLIC REFRAIN FROM VAPING NO MATTER THE SOURCE THERE IS ALWAYS A RISK WHEN YOU INHALE A FOREIGN SUBSTANCE INTO YOUR LUNGS AND THE RISK OF VAPING NOW INCLUDES DEATH. IT CAN BE DIFFICULT FOR CONSUMERS TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN REGULATED AND UNREGULATED PRODUCTS CONSIDERING THERE ARE COUNTERFEIT LABELS THAT CAN BE VERY DECEPTIVE. NUMBER TWO FOR THOSE WHO CHOOSE TO VAPE ONLY PURCHASE FROM A VERIFIED LICENSED RETAILER. NUMBER THREE FOR SOMEONE WHO HAS RECENTLY VAPE AND IS EXPERIENCING SOME OF THESE SYMPTOMS THEY SHOULD SEEK CARE IMMEDIATELY AND THEY NEED TO SHARE THEIR HONEST AND THOROUGH VAPING HISTORY AND PRODUCTS USED WITH THAT PROVIDER. AND NUMBER FOUR IF YOU STOP VAPING DO NOT SWITCH TO CIGARETTES INSTEAD PLEASE CONSIDER USING AN FDA APPROVED QUITTING TREATMENT. THAT CONCLUDES MY REMARKS THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO COME TODAY AND I'LL TAKE ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE. THANK YOU DOCTOR THIS TIME WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR ANY QUESTIONS COMMENTS. YES FIRST OFF THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I'VE BEEN I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT THE CHALLENGES AS WE DO IN OUR COLD AND FLU SEASON AND HOW HOW YOU DISTINGUISH THAT AND THE COMPLICATIONS THAT MAY ARISE FROM PERSON WHO HAD DOES HAVE THE- HAVE A COLD OR THE FLU. AND HOW MUCH OF ONE PLUS ONE MIGHT EQUAL THREE AND THAT'S NOT A GOOD THING IN THIS CASE SO APPRECIATE YOUR YOUR COMMENTS AROUND THAT PEOPLE THAT ARE SUFFER PORTING. ANY RESIDUAL LEFT FOR TESTING HAS THAT IS THAT AND HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY DOING THAT OR IS PRESENT CONSUMED IN ALL GONE BEFORE THEY GET TO YOU. SURE SOME PATIENTS ARE VOLUNTARILY TURNING OVER THE PRODUCT AND THEIR VAPING DEVICE AND THOSE ARE SENT TO THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH TO CONDUCT TESTING. AND SO ALL THE RESULT THE RESULTS ARE STE IT TAKES A WHILE TO DO THAT OBVIOUSLY SO. IT'S BEEN A VERY COMPLEX ANALYSIS AND WE'RE LOOKING AT SOME OF THOSE RESULTS BUT IT REALLY IS IN THE BEGINNING STAGES OF A COMPREHENSIVE LABORATORY ANALYSIS. CONSIDERING HOW MANY CHEMICALS HAVE TO BE TESTED FOR. THANK YOU. FIRST OFF THE FREE TEST MY WERE WE ARE. FIRST CONTACT THE DEPARTMENT AND LOOKED INTO AT THAT TIME THE REPORTED CASES MY RECOLLECTION. WAS SIXTY TWO AT A SIXTY THREE CASES WERE REPORTED THC WITH ONE. CASE I KNOW AND I HEARD YOU SAY EARLIER 81% THC AS HAVE THERE BEEN MORE CASES HAS THAT HAS THAT INFORMATION CHANGED. SINCE I LAST SPOKE WITH. SURE I CAN'T REMEMBER THAT EXACT WEEK BECAUSE THE DATA IS CHANGING SO RAPIDLY BUT YES YOU ARE CORRECT RIGHT NOW 81% OF THE CASES SELF REPORT USING THC. THE NEW ONES IS THAT MANY OF THE CASES ARE COMBINING THE THC WITH C. B. D. AN WITH NICOTINE. AND SO IF YOU'RE TO ADD UP THE PERCENTAGES THAT WE THE DATA THAT WE PUBLISHED ON OUR WEBSITE TODAY YOU'LL SEE IT DOESN'T ADD TO A HUNDRED PERCENT. BECAUSE MANY OF THEM ARE COMBINING THE SUBSTANCES TOGETHER. IN THE MEDIA REPORTS A LONG ILLNESSES HAVE. AT LEAST IT'S BEEN SUGGESTED LINKED TO BLACK MARKET. PRODUCTS AND WE'VE HAD A LOT OF QUESTION ABOUT THAT TODAY. HAVE THERE BEEN ANY CASES OF LONG ILLNESS OR DEATH FOR THAT MATTER. WHO HAVE USED LEGAL CANNABIS PRODUCTS EXCLUSIVELY. I CAN ONLY SPEAK TO THE DATA THAT WE HAVE FOR CALIFORNIA. OF THE SEVENTY EIGHT CASES WHO WERE INTERVIEWED IN CALIFORNIA THERE WAS ONLY ONE CASE SELF REPORTED EXCLUSIVELY PURCHASING FROM LICENSED RETAILERS AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT WHEN WE DO THESE EPIDEMIOLOGY INTERVIEWS FOR ANY OUTBREAK. WERE ASKING PATIENTS TO USE THEIR BEST RECOLLECTION AND SELF REPORT TO THE INTERVIEWER AND SO WE LOOK AT EVERY ASPECT OF THAT AND THAT STILL BEING INVESTIGATED. BUT THERE WAS ONLY ONE CASE THAT SOFT REPORTED EXCLUSIVELY LEGAL RETAILERS EVERYONE ELSE WE CAN ASSUME BASED ON THEIR SELF REPORT NON LEGAL PRODUCTS REALLY SOME NOT LEGAL PRODUCTS. THAT'S CORRECT THE REST TO SELF REPORTED EVEN THE ONES WHO MAY HAVE MENTIONED A BRICK AND MORTAR LOCATION THOSE WERE NOT ABLE TO BE FOUND OR NOT ABLE TO BE VERIFIED IS LICENSED AND HOW MANY OF THEM REPORT EXCLUSIVELY USING NICOTINE BABY PRODUCTS AND KNOW OUR THC OR MARIJUANA PRODUCTS ONLY TEN PERCENT. OF THE SEVENTY EIGHT WHO WERE INTERVIEWED. I ASKED MY STAFF TO DO A LITTLE RESEARCH. IT STRUCK ME AS ODD THE THING IS NOT A ACTIVITY THE ONLY OCCURS HERE IN UNITED STATES BUT YET I'VE HEARD NOTHING OR READ NOTHING. ABOUT DEATH ILLNESS AT CENTER OF DO TODAY BEING OUTSIDE UNITED STATES. CAN YOU SPEAK TO THAT'LL HAVE YOU SEEN ANY EVIDENCE OR REPORTS WORLDWIDE. THERE HAVE BEEN A HANDFUL OF CASES REPORTED IN CANADA I'M NOT AWARE OF THESE CLUSTERS OR OUTBREAK EMERGING IN OTHER COUNTRIES. DOES THAT STRIKE YOU AS ODD. IT STRIKES ME AS INTERESTING. AND AS WE LOOK AT ALL THE POSSIBLE CAUSES IN THE UNITED STATES INCLUDING OUR SB DATA OUR PATIENTS THAT THE CLINICAL LABS. THAT SOMETHING THAT WERE BEING OUT WE'RE LOOKING AT WHAT CHANGED AND WHY NOW. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND APPRECIATE THE ANSWERS. JUST A QUICK FOLLOW UP ON IT I APPRECIATE YOUR LINE OF QUESTIONING THERE SO I THINK IT'S I THINK IS REALLY VALUABLE SAID SOMEONE REPORTED WE HAD ONE PERSON REPORT THAT THEY HAD PURCHASED FROM A LICENSED. REGULATED CANNABIS FACILITY WAS AT VERIFIED THAT THAT INDEED WAS A LICENSED FACILITY OR WAS THAT THE PATIENTS RECOLLECTION BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT IT WAS A LICENSED FACILITY. THAT INVESTIGATION IS STILL ONGOING ALT ALL TELL YOU THAT WE SHARE WE AS PUBLIC HEALTH WHEN WE GET THOSE REPORTS FROM PATIENTS THAT WERE INTERVIEWED. WE SHARE THEM WITH BCC SO THAT THEY CAN BE INVESTIGATED. IN THAT ONE CASE THE FACILITY THE BRICK AND MORTAR LOCATION THAT WAS MENTIONED WAS CONFIRMED TO BE LICENSED. BUT ASPECTS OF THAT ARE STILL BEING INVESTIGATED. THANK YOU. MR Là THANK YOU VERY MUCH. APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS THAT YOU MADE AND IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY YOU HAD INDICATED THAT OF THE DATA STILL INCONCLUSIVE BUT THAT YOU ARE VERY MUCH LOOKING TO THE DISTINCTION ON. A WHAT IS BEEN RECENTLY INTRODUCED AND THAT WHEN THERE'S A CONCLUSION AND TO HOPEFULLY FINDING THE CULPRIT THAT THAT INFORMATION WILL BE READILY AVAILABLE BUT FOR MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WHEN THAT TIME COMES TO WHICH THEN. A GIVEN YOUR RESEARCH THAT YOU DO FIND CONCLUSIVE EVIDENCE OF WHERE THE CULPRIT IS WHAT BEEN TRANSPIRES SO THAT WE CAN ENSURE THAT CONSUMERS WILL BE PROTECTED DOES THAT COME FROM EXECUTIVE ORDER DOES THAT COME FROM. OF ADMINISTRATION AND WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE HOW DO YOU SEE THAT HAPPENING. I THINK THAT WOULD DEPEND ON WHAT THE CULPRIT WAS. IT'S NOT CLEAR THAT IT'S JUST THE SUBSTANCE OR JUST THE DEVICE IT COULD EVEN BE A COMBINATION OF THEM SO IT SEEMS THAT THE ABILITY TO STOP THE OUTBREAK ENDS AND REMOVE THE CULPRIT SUBSTANCE OR DEVICE WILL DEPEND ON WHAT IT IS RIGHT NOW AND NUMBER OF HYPOTHESES ARE BEING LOOKED AT. EVERYTHING'S ON THE TABLE. AND COMBINATIONS AND THAT IS TAKES TO CONCLUSION TO WHICH IS CAUSING HARM AND DEATH WHAT THEN TRANSPIRES. THEN DID DO WE SEE THE ADMINISTRATION AN EXECUTIVE ORDER TO IS THAT THE LEGISLATURE YOU COME TO THE LEGISLATION SAYING OKAY HERE'S WHAT IT ISPLEASE PASSED LEGISLATION HOW DO YOU SEE DID YOU HAVE A SENSE ON HOW THAT WOULD THAN. BEFORE MY SENSE IS THAT IF WE KNEW WHAT WAS CAUSING THIS THAT SWIFT ACTION WOULD BE TAKEN AND ALL OPTIONS WOULD BE CONSIDERED. THANK YOU. THREE OF US. AND SO THAT'S A YOU KNOW A GREAT QUESTION AND CERTAINLY YOU KNOW SO BASED ON ON ON ON WHAT YOU MENTIONED YOU KNOW I FIND A STARTLING THAT THIS COULD TAKE YEARS TO FIND OUT WHAT THE CULPRIT IS A BASED ON WHERE WE ARE NOW IT SEEMS LIKE THIS IS OBVIOUS IN EVOLVING ISSUE AS YOU MENTIONED THE DATA SEEMS TO BE CHANGING AND EVERY STATE IS HANDLING THIS CRISIS AS IT IS FROM DAY TO DAY IN THEIR OWN WAY. WE AS A STATE BASED ON THE EXECUTIVE ORDER THAT THE GOVERNOR SIGNED IS THAT ENOUGH IS THAT RESPONSE ENOUGH FOR OUR STATE WITH THIS CRISIS. MOVING FORWARD. MANY OPTIONS ARE BEING CONSIDERED TO RESPOND TO THIS CRISIS THE RECOMMENDATIONS IN RESPONSE TO THE EXECUTIVE ORDER ARE STILL BEING FINALIZED. BUT MANY OPTIONS ARE ON THE TABLE INCLUDING SWIFT ACTIONS THOROUGH OPTIONS TO ADDRESS THE OUTBREAK AND THE YOUTH VAPING EPIDEMIC. EVEN THOUGH THESE ARE DISTINCT ISSUES THE OUTBREAK OF VAPING LONG INJURY AND THE YOUTH VAPING EPIDEMIC THEY ARE RELATED THERE IS SOME CROSSOVERS I THINK DOCTOR WOULD HAVE POINTED OUT AT THE BEGINNING. AND SO THE RECOMMENDATIONS BEING CONSIDERED TAKE A BROAD APPROACH AND EVERYTHING'S ON THE TABLE. RESTORED FINAL FINALLY THANK YOU THANK YOU IS THE MORE SEVERE THE MORE HERE THAN WHERE YOU QUESTIONS YOU COME UP WITH BUT CONSIDERING THAT ACTUALLY VAPING HAS BEEN AROUND FOR AWHILE AND NOT JUST NICOTINE BUT ALSO CANNABIS DOES IT NOT SURPRISE YOU THAT SUDDENLY THIS IS HAPPENING THIS THIS THIS JUST FEELS A LOT LIKE THIS IS ISOLATE TO SOMETHING BECAUSE THERE HAVE BEEN OTHER THINGS YOU YOU KNOW WE GO BACK TO SEVERAL YEARS AGO. AND THE CANNABIS INDUSTRY THAT'S THEIR MEETINGS BEEN GOING ON FOR AWHILE CERTAINLY WITH NICOTINE'S BEEN GOING ON FOR AWHILE BUT ALL OF A SUDDEN WHICH THERE'S SOMETHING SOMETHING'S NOT RIGHT AND THIS IS THAT THAT OBVIOUSLY IS UNUSUAL ON DOES THAT. DOES THAT SURPRISE YOU IN SOME WAY. YES AND AS WE DISCUSSED THIS WITH OTHER STATES WHO WERE FACING A SIMILAR OUTBREAK SITUATION SINCE AUGUST THAT QUESTION EMERGED. THE INCREASING CASES THAT WE'RE SEEING IS IT AN ARTIFACT OF US LOOKING FOR THEM HAD THEY BEEN THERE ALL ALONG I BELIEVE IN CALIFORNIA THE ANSWER IS NOW THAT THIS IS SOMETHING NEW THAT WERE SAYING THAT WE HAVEN'T SEEN BEFORE. WE DON'T KNOW THE CAUSE YET SO WE DON'T KNOW WHY BUT WE'RE LOOKING AT MULTIPLE THEORIES AND ASKING WHAT CHANGED TO BECAUSE THIS SPIKING CASES THERE ARE REPORTS IN THE LITERATURE REPORTING SIMILAR ADD VAPING LONG INJURY CASES FROM BEFORE AUGUST OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN. BUT NOT EVEN CLOSE TO THE NUMBER THAT WE'RE SEEING NOW. THAT KIND OF BRINGS ME BACK TO WINE. THE VITAMIN A ACETATE YOU MENTION THAT. WAS AN INGREDIENT NOT FOUND IN ALL CASES BUT WHAT DO WE KNOW. ABOUT THE EFFECTS OF INHALING VITAMIN ASKED. I'M SORRY THE EFFECTS OF WHAT OF INHALING VITAMIN THE ASKED. DO WE KNOW ANYTHING NOT A LOT SO ONE OF THE CHALLENGES OF INVESTIGATING POSSIBLE CULPRITS LIKE VITAMIN A ACETATE. I'M IS THAT IT'S NOT JUST THE SUBSTANCE ITSELF SO IT MIGHT BE SAFE WHEN INGESTED YOU CAN EAT IT MAYBE IT'S A VITAMIN YOU KNOW IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE THINK MAY HAVE HEALTH BENEFITS WHEN EATEN. BUT WHEN YOU HEAT IT UP AND YOU VAPORIZE IT AND YOU INHALE IT INTO THE LONG. THE EFFECTS IT HAS ON THE LONG TISSUE ON THE LITTLE AIR SACS IS UNKNOWN AND SO LOOKING AT EACH CULPRIT EVEN AS VITAMIN A ACETATE IS CONSIDERED ISN'T JUST TESTING THE ACTUAL LIQUID ITSELF. IT INVOLVES TESTING WHAT HAPPENS WHEN IT'S VAPORIZED OUR NEW COMPOUNDS CREATED AND THEN WHAT HAPPENS WHEN IT'S INHALED INTO THE LONG WHAT DOES THE TISSUE DAMAGE LOOK LIKE WHAT DO THE CELLS LOOK LIKE. THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY GETTING TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS COULD TAKE TIME BECAUSE IT COULD INVOLVE STUDIES OVER A PERIOD OF TIME USING ANIMAL MODELS LOOKING AT OF A- WIDE RANGE OF TOXINS THAT ARE HEATED TO THE POINT OF BEING VAPORIZE AND THEN INHALED. INTO THE LUNGS. SO I THINK YOU'RE REGIONAL QUESTION WAS WHAT IS THE EFFECT OF VITAMIN E. ACETATE. IT WAS AT THAT MAY HAVE BEEN WHAT WAS CAUSING THE LIGHT POINT AMMONIA. THAT IS BEING EXAMINED AND STUDIED AND- YET UNKNOWN. IN MY UNDERSTANDING IS IT'S NOT. IT IS AT THIS TIME A LEGAL INGREDIENT. FOR ILLEGAL CANNABIS PRODUCTS IS THE IS THE IS THAT CORRECT OR IS IT IN FACT IT BANNED INGREDIENTS WE TAKE ANY ACTION ON THAT TO YOUR KNOWLEDGE ON VITAMIN E. ACETATE IT'S NOT INCLUDED IN THE LIST OF THINGS THAT MANUFACTURERS MUST TEST FOR. OKAY. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS BEFORE WE MAKE HER JUST. I'VE BEEN GOING BACK AND FORTH WELL AND IT IS THE BACK AND FORTH AND IT IS IT IS A IS ONE OF THE CHALLENGES WITH WHEN I'M I'M SICKENED SPEAK SPECIFICALLY TO THE CANNABIS INDUSTRY THINGS ONE OF THE CHALLENGES WITH THIS INDUSTRY THERE ARE THINGS IN THE HISTORY THAT HAVE BEEN USED IN THE PAST THAT WERE SAFE ON OTHER THINGS I THINK THERE'S A THERE'S A THERE'S A PESTICIDE CALLED EAGLE TWENTY YEARS OR SO I'M I MAY BE SAYING IT WRONG. BUT WAS USEFUL USED ON LEAFY VEGETABLES AND OTHER KINDS OF THINGS AND IT WAS SAFE BUT WHEN YOU ACTUALLY BURNED IT INTO ITALY IT LIBERATED CYANIDE SO THAT'S OVIOUSLY NOT SAFE AND IT WAS NOT KNOWN BY A OTHER PEOPLE SO. BECAUSE WE'RE NOT TESTING FOR IT NOW WELL IF TO THE BUREAU. THERE MAY BE OTHER THINGS IT EMERGED HAVE. VITAMIN THE ACETATE ON ITS OWN MAY BE PERFECTLY SAFE BUT IN THIS SETTING MAY MAY NOT. AND SO IT IS PARTICULARLY CHALLENGING. AS PEOPLE OR- SOME PROBABLY EXPERIMENTING QUITE FRANKLY. AND ADDING THINGS TO THE PRODUCTS TO ENHANCE THEM IN SOME WAY BUT- BUT THIS IS THIS IS NOT AN UNUSUAL. OCCURRENCE OF THIS THIS IS AN ISOLATED INCIDENT WITH THIS WITH THE INDUSTRY AND- PART OF THAT IS THE CHALLENGE OF DOING RESEARCH AND BEING ABLE TO SEE WHAT TRULY A SAFE AND WHICH REALLY ISN'T. I THINK AFTER. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY I THINK AT THIS TIME WE WILL TAKE ANY PUBLIC COMMENT. ONE ANY OF US. OKAY SEE WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT INTERESTED PUBLIC COMMENT WE'RE GOING TO ASK YOU IN LIGHT OF. THE RIGHT TO THE HEARING HERE TO TRY TO CONFINE YOUR COMMENTS TO AROUND ONE MINUTE. THANK YOU SO MUCH AND GO AHEAD AND BEGIN NAY GRAYSON. YOU SO MUCH I REALLY WE REALLY APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO TALK WITH YOU TODAY SO THANK YOU TO THE CHAIRS AND THE COMMITTEE. MY NAME IS LINDSAY ROBINSON I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA CANNABIS INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION WE REPRESENT ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED MEMBERS ACROSS THE STATE AND ROUGHLY FIFTEEN THOUSAND EMPLOYEES. THE LEGAL CANNABIS INDUSTRY IS EXTREMELY CONCERNED ABOUT THE CURRENT BEEPING ISSUES AS WELL AS COUNTERFEIT PRODUCTS FLOODING THE ILLICIT MARKET WE'RE COMMITTED TO BUILDING CONSUMER SAFETY AND CONFIDENCE AND OUR FOCUS IS ON PUBLIC SAFETY WE LOOK FORWARD TO OUR CONTINUED PARTNERSHIP. WITH THE REGULATORS THE NEWSMEN MINISTRATION AND THE LEGISLATURE AS YOU ALL KNOW HOW THE LEGAL CANNABIS INDUSTRY VIGOROUSLY TESTS ALL OF ITS PRODUCTS THE FOLKS WHO ARE OUR MEMBERS YOU SEE SEE I A AND ARE PART OF THE LEGAL INDUSTRY HAVE ABSOLUTELY HE JUMPED THROUGH ALL OF THE HOOPS TO BE COMPLIANT AND WE'RE ABSOLUTELY COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH ALL OF YOU. OUR BIGGEST FEAR IS THAT IF WE CUT OFF ACCESS TO LEGAL CANNABIS THE ILLICIT MARKET THRIVES EVEN FURTHER WHICH CREATES MORE REST OF PUBLIC HEALTH SO WE APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PARTNER WITH YOU AND BE A RESOURCE AND THANK YOU. FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY THANK YOU. HI GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN NOT. GRAY AND CHAIRMAN WOULD IN AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS TIFFANY DEBT THAT I WORK WITH CANNOT CRAP I HAD A BAR CONSUMER AND GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS. WHERE ONE OF THE LARGEST MANUFACTURERS IN THE STATE WE'VE DONE A LOT OF RESEARCH ON THIS ISSUE. IT IS WORTH MENTIONING THAT CALIFORNIA HAS THE MOST RIGOROUS TESTING STANDARDS IN THE COUNTRY. WE DID SOME A COMPARATIVE TESTING OF OTHER PRODUCTS IN CALIFORNIA CANNABIS WITH REGARD TO PESTICIDES. IS CLEANER THAN CHOCOLATE MILK IT'S CLEANER THAN LINE IT'S CLEANER THAN BABY FOOD. IT LOOKS AS THOUGH THIS IS THE VAPING ISSUE IS AN ISSUE WITH THE AT LISETTE MARKET OUR MESSAGE TO YOU. IS THAT IT THE ONLY WAY DOES STOP THE ILLNESSES AND DEATHS THAT ARE HAPPENING IS TO HELP CONSUMERS MIGRATE FROM THE ILLICIT MARKET TO THE LIST OF MARKET. THERE ARE THREE REASONS WHY THEY'RE BUYING IN THE BLACK MARKET THEY CAN'T TELL THE DIFFERENCE THEY DON'T WANT TO PAY THREE TIMES AS MUCH FOR THE REGULATED PRODUCT. OR THEY DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO REGULATED PRODUCTS SO ARE WHAT WE TO URGE YOU TO DO IS TO WORK COME PASSING THIRTEEN FIFTY SIX TO EXPAND ACCESS TO LEGAL WELL TESTED WELL REGULATED CANADA. AND LOOK AT SOME FOR FARM THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR THIS HEARING MY NAME'S DALE GEHRINGER WITH OUR WITH CALIFORNIA NORMAL HI SPONSORED THE FIRST PUBLISHED STUDIES ON CANNABIS VAPORIZATION A BACK IN TWO THOUSAND AND ONE AND TWO THOUSAND AND THREE WHICH DEMONSTRATED QUITE CLEARLY. THAT THE PRICES WERE VERY EFFECTIVE IN REMOVING THE WITH TOXINS IN MARIJUANA SMOKING WERE REALLY HELPFUL AS A- SMOKE HARM REDUCTION DEVICE SINCE THEN A MARIJUANA VAPORIZERS HAVE COME TO BE. ACCEPTED AS THE OUR GOLD STANDARD FOR ADMINISTRATION IN MEDICAL STUDIES. HOWEVER THERE ARE VAPORIZERS AND THERE ARE VAPORIZERS THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF INNOVATION RECENTLY WITH NEW KINDS EXTRACTS POSSIBLE NEW CHEMICALS AND ADDITIVES AND THERE IS AN ISSUE ABOUT THE HARDWARE WHICH COMES FROM CHINA. FROM MANY DIFFERENT SOURCES ARE SOME OF THEM MORE. REPUTABLE THAN OTHERS SO I THINK WE WILL TO INVESTIGATE THOSE THINGS ARE HOWEVER I HAVE TO OUR ON OUR- HI. CONSUMERS REALLY APPRECIATE THE AVAILABILITY OF TESTED HIGH QUALITY. VAPORIZERS ALL MOVING OUT MARKET NOW IN CALIFORNIA OUR HOPE THEY STAY THERE AND SHOULD A PROBLEM EVER ARISE WITH ONE OF THOSE AT LEAST WE'LL BE ABLE TO TRACK IT DOWN A LOT. BETTER THAN THE STUFF IS FROM THE OFFICE OF MARK THANK YOU. RAND MARTIN HERE ON BEHALF OF CLEAVER IS ONE OF THE LARGEST VERTICALLY INTEGRATED OPERATIONS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WE APPRECIATE THE EMPHASIS TODAY ON ENFORCEMENT WE CAN TELL YOU FROM THE PERSPECTIVE ON THE GROUND IS ENFORCEMENT RESOURCES MAY BE SUBSTANTIAL BUT THEY ARE FAR FROM SUFFICIENT. WE AS A STAKEHOLDERS IN YOU IS THE LEGISLATURE HAVE WORK TO PUT MORE FUNDS INTO THE BUDGET FOR THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS FOR MORE RESOURCES FOR ENFORCEMENT. THAT WAS DONE IN THE CONTEXT OF MAKING IT EASIER FOR LEGAL OPERATORS TO CONTINUE TO OPERATE SUCCESSFULLY AND ALSO TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR TAX RESOURCES WERE WERE ROBUST AS AS PROJECTED BUT NOW IT'S TAKING A WHOLE NEW COMPLY. TAKEN ON A WHOLE NEW COMPLEXION WITH THIS PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUE WE REALLY NEED THIS COMING BUDGET CYCLE TO AMP UP OUR EFFORTS TO GET MORE EXCUSE ME MORE MONEY INTO THE BUDGET FOR ENFORCEMENT PURPOSES. THANK YOU. HI AM ELLEN COME WITH CALIFORNIA NORMALLY HAVE AN OPPOSITE PERSPECTIVE OF. THE HUNDRED YEARS OF PUNITIVE ACTIONS AGAINST MARIJUANA SELLERS HASN'T MADE OUR STATE SAFER. THE ONLY THING THAT WILL EVER WORK IS PROPER REASONABLE REGULATION. WE THANK LORI A JETS IN THE BCC FOR AN ACTING THOSE REGULATIONS IN CALIFORNIA KEEPING US SAFE. WE SUPPORTED THE BILLS MR LOW MENTION TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM OF TWO THIRDS OF CALIFORNIA CITIES AND COUNTIES NOT LICENSING. CANNABIS RETAILER DELIVERY. TO LAURIE IN KINGS COUNTY WHERE WE HAVE SEEN DEATHS DUE TO THIS CRISIS HAVE NO LEGAL OPTION AVAILABLE. MR GREY THERE WAS NO BILL TO ENCOURAGE CANNABIS USE BY PASSENGERS AND COMMERCIAL VEHICLES IN CALIFORNIA THAT WAS ALLOWED FOR IN CAL IN PROP SIXTY FOUR AS IT IS IN COLORADO. THERE WAS A BILL TO REGULATE THOSE VEHICLES WHICH WAS SENSATIONALIZED IN THE PRESS AS ALLOWING IT. NOW THE TRANSPORTATION BILL HAS ENSURED THAT THE EXEMPTION FOR PASSENGERS AND SUCH VEHICLES APPLIES ONLY TO ALCOHOL. NOT CANNABIS. EXCESSIVE ALCOHOL USE IN CALIFORNIA IS RESPONSIBLE FOR TEN THOUSAND DEATHS AND SEVENTY TWO THOUSAND HOSPITALIZATIONS ANNUALLY. THE PENALTY IN CALIFORNIA FOR ILLEGAL SALES OF FIREARMS AS FAR AS I CAN FIND IS A MISDEMEANOR. WITH THE ONE THOUSAND DOLLAR FINE THERE ARE THIRTY FIVE HUNDRED DEATHS DUE TO FIREARMS ANNUALLY IN CALIFORNIA. GOOD AFTERNOON TURN MEMBERS MY NAME IS JESSE GROW AND I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF U. S. T. W. WESTERN STATES COUNCIL I USED TO DOUBLE REPRESENTS THOUSANDS OF CANNABIS WORKERS WITHIN THE STATE. WE'RE COMMITTED TO ENSURING THE LEGAL CANNABIS INDUSTRY CONTINUES TO PUT CONSUMER SAFETY FIRST STRONG REGULATIONS AND STRONG ENFORCEMENT ARE CRITICAL TO PROTECTING CONSUMERS. THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH WHILE CAUTIONING AGAINST VAPING UNTIL MORE IS KNOWN ABOUT THE RATE OF THESE ILLNESSES HAS BEEN CLEARED ITS ADVICE TO CONSUMERS. ILLEGAL CANNABIS DISPENSARIES SO UNREGULATED AN UNTESTED CANVAS PRODUCTS AND SHOULD NOT BE USED ONE THING WE DO KNOW IS THAT LICENSE CANNABIS BUSINESSES CONTINUE TO BE THE SAFEST OPTION FOR CONSUMERS. NO CANNABIS WAITING PRODUCTS PURCHASED AT LEGAL CANNABIS BUSINESSES HAVE BEEN CONFIRMED LINKED TO ANY OF THE RECENT HEALTH CASES REPORTED. I IN RESPONSE TO THE OUTBREAKS OF RESPIRATORY ILLNESS LINKED TO VACATE VAPING IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT CALIFORNIA FURTHER STRENGTHEN ITS ENFORCEMENT EFFORTS THE THREAT THE ILLICIT MARKET BY IDENTIFYING CLOSING THE ESTIMATED THREE THOUSAND A LEGAL DISPENSARIES. OPERATING IN THE STATE AT THE SAME TIME STATE OFFICIALS AND INDUSTRY LEADERS MUST REDOUBLE THEIR COMMITMENT TO ENSURING A LEGAL MARKET PLACE IN WHICH CONSUMERS CAN PURCHASE CANNABIS. PRODUCTS WITH CONFIDENCE ON THEIR SAFETY THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON LYNN SILVER THE PUBLIC HEALTH INSTITUTE DOCTOR WOULD YOUR FORMER COUNTY HEALTH OFFICER I'M GLAD TO SEE THIS HEARING TODAY. THIS IS NOT JUST AN ISSUE OF LEGAL VERSUS ILLEGAL PRODUCTS THIS IS A MUCH DEEPER PROBLEM IF THERE IS NO SINGLE CAUSE WE NEED TO LOOK AT THE FORCES THAT ARE DRIVING ADDICTION INITIATION AND HEAVY USE AND THEREBY EXPOSING PEOPLE TO WHATEVER HAZARDS ON MAYBE CAUSING THIS EPIDEMIC BUT ALSO THE MANY OTHER MEN MORE SERIOUS HEALTH CONSEQUENCES ONE NOT MORE SERIOUS THAN DEATH OBVIOUSLY. THIS WEEK FOR EXAMPLE I PURCHASED STILL Z. GRANDDADDY PURP A SLING A SLEEPING VAPING DEVICE WHICH I'LL GIVE YOU GUYS RESEMBLING A MEMORY STICK WITH GREAT FLAVOR NINETY THREE MILLIGRAMS FOUR TIMES THE MAXIMUM T. H. C. DOES FOR EDIBLE PACKAGES FORTY TIMES THE MAXIMUM CANADIAN EDIBLE PACKAGES THE EQUIVALENT OF THIRTY EIGHT NINETEEN NINETY JOINTS. FURTHERMORE IN JUST ZERO POINT ZERO TWO OUNCES IT IS AN INVITATION TO USE THE DICTION LEGALLY MARKETED IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FOR THE MORE RECENT STUDIES DEMONSTRATE A FIVE FOLD INCREASE AND PSYCHOSIS RISK WITH THEY'LL USE OF CANNABIS PRODUCTS OVER 10% THC WHICH IS ALMOST THE ENTIRE CALIFORNIA REGULATED IN LEGAL OR ILLEGAL MARKET. WE NEED TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES TO SUCCESSFULLY REVERSE BOTH THIS EPIDEMIC IN NEGATIVE HEALTH CONSEQUENCES FROM CANNABIS I WANT TO MAKE A COUPLE OF A FEW JUST VERY CONCRETE RECOMMENDATIONS AND I CAN LEAVE A WRITTEN A SET OF COMMENTS WITH YOU ONLY CALL FOR URGENT COMMONSENSE ACTION FROM THE STATE LEGISLATURE IN STATE AGENCIES TO PREVENT EVEN MORE SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES. FIRST CLOSE THE KITTY ON RAMP OF FLAVORED PRODUCTS AND SOUNDS LIKE FLAVORED PRODUCTS LIKE THE ONE ASSEMBLY MEMBER GRAY CITED THE BANANA OF THE THIS AND THAT THAT MAY NOT BE FLAVORED BUT CERTAINLY SOUND TO A KID LIKE THEY ARE BOTH FOR NICOTINE IN FOR CANNABIS. SECOND BUILD ON SAN FRANCISCO EN ROUTE. MEN'S COURAGEOUS INITIATIVES AND SUSPEND SALES OF BEIPING PRODUCTS. A UNTIL THE E. CIGARETTE INDUSTRY PROVES THEIR SAFETY TO THE FTA AND FOR THE CASE OF CANNABIS UNTIL WE UNDERSTAND WHAT IS GOING ON WITH THE BEIPING EPIDEMIC. THIRD INTERRUPT THE ADDICTION GLIDE PATH CREATED BY PRODUCTS LIKE THIS BY LIMITING THE POTENCY OF THC PRODUCTS ALLOWED. THIS WILL REDUCE YOUTH ADDICTION TO BEIPING LUNG DISEASE PSYCHOSIS A SECONDARY DAVE CANNABIS WOULD Y. IN QUEBEC FOR EXAMPLE HAVE ALREADY DONE THIS. FOURTH TELL PEOPLE THE TRUTH WE ONLY HAVE WARNINGS IN SIX POINT FONT ON PACKAGES TODAY WE NEED TO HAVE CLEAR PROMINENT HEALTH WARNINGS TO CONSUMERS IN STORES ON PRODUCTS AND ON ADDS. MAKING CLEAR THE RECOGNIZED HEALTH RISKS FROM CANNABIS INCLUDING ADDICTION LOW BIRTH WEIGHT BEEPING. THE BABY NAPA DIMMICK PSYCHOSIS AND SO FORTH. FIFTY LIMIT THE MARKETING THAT KIDS AND TEENS ARE SEEING EVERY DAY FOR EXAMPLE EVEN THE RESTRICTION ON BILLBOARDS THAT WAS PART OF PROP SIXTY FOUR WAS WEAKENED BY THE DECEMBER REGULATIONS ALLOWING SOME OF THE SPATE OF BILLBOARDS WERE SEEING ALL ACROSS THE STATE. DO NOT ALLOW MARKETING IN RESTAURANTS ALCOHOL STORES AND OTHER PLACES WHERE KIDS GO WE BOUGHT A COFFEE CUP IN UP I THINK WAS PETER STAR BUCKS A WEEK AGO WITH THE CHILL BANNER. ON THE COFFEE CUP FOR EXAMPLE. AND ESTABLISH A SCIENTIFIC ADVISORY BOARD FOR CANNABIS REGULATION THAT IS FREE OF CONFLICTS OF INTEREST. ON THAT IS ESSENTIAL TO HELP GUIDE THESE PROCESSES WITH EXEMPTION THE TIME FOR ACTION IS NOW THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS LET ME REMIND EVERYBODY WE JUST EXPERIENCED TWO VERY LONG ONE MINUTE COMMENTS. WE ACTUALLY THE COULD BE GENERALLY INTERESTED IN WHAT YOU HAVE SAVED THE DEGREE TO WHICH YOU COULD CONFINE YOUR COMMENTS TO A MINUTE AND PROVIDE ANY WRITTEN TESTIMONY QUESTIONS SIR TO THE COMMITTEE WILL CERTAINLY MAKE SURE EVERYBODY SEES US. PERCY GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ON DRESS I MADE AS ON BEHALF OF SELECT MOXIE IN CROSS GO ONE THANK YOU FOR CALLING THIS INFORMATIONAL HEARING TO DISCUSS IMPORTANT TOPICS. AND THANK GOD THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR ALL THE WORK THROUGH THE LEADERSHIP OF CAMERON FORNEY THE CEO OF SELECT WE'VE HELPED BUILD A LARGE COALITION OF TWENTY FIVE PLUS CANNABIS INDUSTRY BUSINESSES. TO COME TOGETHER AND RECOMMEND FIVE PILLARS NOW WE STRONGLY BELIEVE WOULD LEAD TO AN EFFECTIVE AN IMMEDIATE IMPACT ON A LIST OF VAPING PRODUCTS WE'VE SHARED OUR COALITION RECOMMENDATIONS WITH COMMITTEE STAFF AND THE FIVE PILLARS INCLUDE ADDRESSING THE ILLICIT MARKET. ENHANCING TESTING REGULATIONS CERTIFYING HARDWARE AND FACILITIES. AND I COUNTERFEITING EFFORTS AND CERTIFIED SHIPPING. WE'VE HAD MANY DISCUSSIONS AND MEETINGS WITH GOVERNOR NEWSOME'S ADMINISTRATION AS WELL AS CANNABIS REGULATORS. AND WE GREATLY APPRECIATE THEIR EFFORT AND INTEREST TO WORK WITH US AND DISCUSS OUR RECOMMENDATIONS. WE'RE EXCITED A PARTNER AND WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE SPECIFICALLY YOUR COMMITTEES. TO ENSURE THAT YOUTH VAPING EPIDEMIC IS NOT ONLY REDUCED WITHOUT STRONG EFFECTIVE ENFORCEMENT IS DIRECTED AT AROUND A KIDDING ILLEGAL ENCOUNTER FOR VAPING PRODUCTS IN CALIFORNIA THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE COMMITTEE FOR COMMUNITY TODAY AND HAVING THIS HEARING IF THERE'S ONE MESSAGE I WOULD LIKE THE COMMITTEE TO TAKE AWAY FROM THIS IS THREE WORDS BANDS DON'T WORK MY NAME IS LOUIS HAN I'M A CALIFORNIA NATIVE AND I HAVE BETTER THOUSANDS OF CANNABIS COMPANIES FOR THE RQ GROUP A NINE YEAR OLD INVESTOR NETWORK THAT HAS INVESTED MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS. INTO THE CANNABIS INDUSTRY. A MORATORIUM ON ALL CANNABIS VAPING IS NOT THE ANSWER. DESPITE YEARS OF CANNABIS DATA PRODUCTS THING ON THE MARKET WE ARE ONLY HEARING ABOUT THESE ISSUES NOW THIS IS BECAUSE THIS IS THE DEATH RATTLE OF ILLEGITIMATE PRODUCERS ARE USING FAST AND CHEAP METHODS IN ORDER TO CLING. ON TO THE MARKET SHARE THAT THEY HAVE LEFT. A BAN ON CAMPUS BEEPING IS EXACT RESPONSE THAT THEY'RE LOOKING FOR. BECAUSE THAT WILL SHUT DOWN THEIR LEGITIMATE COMPETITORS WHILE ALLOWING THEM TO CONTINUE TO THRIVE. BANDS WILL ONLY PERPETUATE THIS PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS INSTEAD WE SHOULD INVEST MORE RESOURCES INTO ENFORCEMENT AND RESEARCH.

GOOD AFTERNOON LARA DOCKS DEAL WITH EVEN ENTERPRISES WHICH AS A FULLY LICENSED VERTICALLY INTEGRATED CANNABIS COMPANY THAT INCLUDES MANUFACTURING VAPE PRODUCTS WHICH ARE RIGOROUSLY TESTED AS YOU'VE HEARD TODAY I WOULD JUST LIKE TO ECHO SOME OF THE COMMENTS I'VE BEEN HEARING WHICH IS THAT YES THE PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUE IS VERY IMPORTANT AND SHOULD BE ADDRESSED IN A SMART AND AFFECTIVE WAY. NOT WITH REACTIONARY BANDS BUT WITH THOROUGH RESEARCH PUBLIC EDUCATION AND REALLY GETTING TO THE ROOT OF THE PROBLEM WHICH WE'VE HEARD IS DIRECTLY CONNECTED TO THE ILLICIT MARKET CREATED THROUGH PROHIBITION AND LACK OF ENFORCEMENT THAT BEING SAID AND I AGREE WITH OTHERS THAT THIS ISSUE IS BEING SOMEWHAT COMPLETED WITH THE YOUTH OF BEEPING AND THE TRACTOR FLAVORS BUT IF THE STATE. IN OTHER LOCAL MUNICIPALITIES ARE CONSIDERING A FLAVOR BàN I WOULD THAT WOULD EXTEND TO CANNABIS I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO CAREFULLY CONSIDER AND MAKE CLEAR THE DEFINITION OF FLAVOR WHICH SHOULD FOCUS ON ARTIFICIAL FLAVORS RATHER THAN NATURALLY OCCURRING TERPENES. THANK YOU. THANK YOU HELLO ALICIA PRIEGO ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CANNABIS MANUFACTURERS ASSOCIATION AND WE ALSO STAND READY TO WORK WITH AND BE A RESOURCE FOR THE LEGISLATURE AND THE REGULATORY AGENCIES. AS COVERED EXHAUSTIVELY TODAY THIS IS A YOUTH ANALYST AT MARKET ISSUE AND WE ARE ALSO LOOKING AT BEST PRACTICES AND HAVE SEEN IN EUROPE AND THAT THEY HAVE A VERY VIGOROUS EDUCATION EFFORT ON THE USE OF A BEING. DEVICES AND HARDWARE AND ALSO LIMIT NICOTINE CONTENT AND OTHER INGREDIENTS INSIDE THE DEVICES AND NOTABLY DO NOT HAVE THE SAME ISSUES THAT WE'RE EXPERIENCING HERE. I'M AND LASTLY THE NOTABLE ABSENCE OF REPORT CITING CASES ARISING FROM LEGAL REGULATED OUTLET SPEAK STRONGLY TO THE EFFECTIVENESS OF CONTROLLED ACCESS AND REGULATION THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

AND THEN ADOPTING SOME ANTI COUNTERFEITING. MEASURES WOULD CERTAINLY BE CRITICALLY IMPORTANT THANK YOU. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MY MICHAEL WHEELER I'M THE VICE PRESIDENT OF POLICY WITH FLOW KANA AND WERE CANNABIS DISTRIBUTOR THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR TAKING TIME TODAY WITH THIS HEARING OBVIOUSLY A VERY COMPLICATED ISSUE I ASK ECHO MANY OF MY PEERS WITH REGARDS TO THEIR REMARKS AROUND THE USEFULNESS EFFECTIVENESS OF BANDS AND PROHIBITION THEY DON'T WORK I THINK WE'VE TALKED A LOT ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF HOW HOW WE ENCOURAGE USE OF THE REGULATED MARKET THROUGH REDUCING TAXATION AND INCREASING ACCESS TO A LEGAL REGULATED PRODUCT HOWEVER WHAT I WANTED TO ADD TO THE COMMENTS TODAY WERE THAT. I'VE GOT THREE KIDS AT HOME THEY'RE YOUNG THEY'RE NOT TO EXPOSE TO THIS YET BUT I MEAN I'M VERY CONCERNED ABOUT IT I'M VERY CONCERNED ABOUT TEEN VAPING AND ABSOLUTELY POSITIVELY YOU KNOW WE STAND AT YOUR SIDE IN INCOME WORKING IN ANY WAY TO STAMP OUT TEAM VAPING THIS IS A HORRIBLE EPIDEMIC I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU WHEN I DIDN'T HEAR ANY OF THE PANELISTS TALK ABOUT TODAY WAS SOME OF THE FACTORS THAT ADD TO THE COOLNESS SO WHEN YOU GET A CHANCE TO TAKE A LOOK AT YOU TO. GO LOOK AT TEEN THEY ARE VAPE TRACKS ANYTHING HAVING TO DO WITH VAPE TRICKS ON YOUTUBE IT'S AMAZING IT'S REALLY COOL YOU'LL BE YOUR JOB WILL DROP AND THIS IS PART OF WHAT MAKES IT COOL KIDS SIT AROUND ALL DAY SUCKING ON THEIR ON THEIR THE PEN DOING THESE TRICKS OVER AND OVER AGAIN IT'S PRACTICE PRACTICE MAKES PERFECT BUT IT'S ADDING TO THE USE OF THESE PRODUCTS SO. JUST ANOTHER ANOTHER DATA POINT FOR ALL OF THIS THANKS. GOOD AFTERNOON PAMELA LOPEZ WITH CASE STREET CONSULTING. ON BEHALF OF THE SILICON VALLEY CANNABIS ALLIANCE. CANNABIS IS MEDICINE AND LICENSED AND REGULATED. FOLKS IN THE CANNABIS INDUSTRY ARE ABSOLUTE PARTNERS AND WORKING WITH YOU TO GET TO THE HEART OF THIS CRISIS. WE WOULD URGE YOU TO REMEMBER AT THAT ACCESS TO CANNABIS IS AN IMPORTANT WAY. TO HELP CONSUMERS GET AWAY FROM THE BLACK MARKET ILLICIT PRODUCTS THAT ARE MAKING THEM SICK. IF I RECALL CORRECTLY TO DATE ONLY SIX HUNDRED LICENSED RETAILERS EXIST IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE LICENSED NON. OUT STOREFRONT DISTRIBUTORS THAT'S DOWN FROM THREE THOUSAND STOREFRONTS THAT WERE OPEN. BEFORE THE PASSAGE OF PROP SIXTY FOUR AND BEFORE CANNABIS WAS LICENSED AND REGULATED. SO THERE WILL ALWAYS BE BAD GUYS WHO ARE TRYING TO SELL ILLICIT STUFF ON THE BLACK MARKET TO MAKE A QUICK BUCK. BUT IT'S OUR JOB IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO MAKE SURE THAT CONSUMERS. HAVE ACCESS TO PRODUCTS THAT THEY KNOW ARE LICENSED AND SAFE. HI SABRINA FANDRICH WITH BERKELEY PATIENTS GROUP AND JUST TO REITERATE WHAT SOME OF THE OTHER PEOPLE OF SAID WE OUR COUNTRY IN OUR STATE OF GONE THROUGH MULTIPLE ITERATIONS OF PROHIBITION. EVERY SINGLE TIME WE REALIZE THAT IT DOESN'T WORK OUT THAT WAS THE WHOLE POINT OF PROP SIXTY FOUR HOWEVER WHEN YOU HAVE TWO THIRDS OF THE STATE THAT ARE BANNING RETAIL SALES IT SHOULDN'T BE A SURPRISE TO ANYONE. THAT WE'RE SEEING THE BATHTUB GIN OF TWENTY NINETEEN HAPPENING OR THE QUE TO SPICE OF TWENTY NINETEEN HAPPENING. I WOULD ALSO NOTE. IT'S IMPORTANT WHEN TALKING ABOUT FLAVORS TO CONSIDER THE GENESIS OF THE FLAVOR IT WAS MENTIONED BEFORE AND THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN NATURALLY OCCURRING FLAVORS AND ARTIFICIAL FLAVORS. AND ALSO I WANTED TO BRING TO YOUR ATTENTION OF AND NOBODY HAS MENTIONED TODAY IS LOOKING AT THE DATA IN THE U. K. AND IN EUROPE AND- THIS IS A VERY UNIQUELY AMERICAN CRISIS DOWN. THE UNITED KINGDOM HAS ONE OF THE LOWEST YOUTH USE RATES AND ACTUALLY SUBSIDIZES VAPE SMOKING AND PROMOTED AS SMOKING SENSATION POLICY. AND THERE SHOULD WE SHOULD ASK THE QUESTION AS TO WHY WHY IS THERE A DISCONNECT BETWEEN YOU KNOW EVIDENCE BASED PUBLIC POLICY AND- EMOTIONALLY DRIVEN PROHIBITIVE POLICIES THAT ARE. UNIQUELY AMERICAN THAT WE NEED TO LOOK AWAY FROM THANK YOU. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS ERIC ACOSTA WITH THE AMERICAN LUNG ASSOCIATION VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE ROBUST DISCUSSION TODAY ON THIS ISSUE AND WE JUST SIMPLY WANT TO EMPHASIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF INCLUDING FLAVORS IN THE CONVERSATION PARTICULARLY MEANT AND MENTHOL AGAIN VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE DISCUSSION FOR THE FOR THE CONVERSATION THANK YOU. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON A CHAIRMAN GRAY AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS ALEX THOMPSON I AM THE DIRECTOR OF COMPLIANCE FOR PURE EXTRACTS VAPORIZER CARTRIDGE MANUFACTURER AND DEL REY OAKS I WORK ALONGSIDE THREE DOZEN DILIGENT ETHICAL PEOPLE PASSIONATELY HOPING MEDICINAL AND RECREATIONAL CONSUMERS THROUGH OUR PRODUCTS. AS I HOPE EACH OF YOU CAN SAY I LOVE MY WORK I JOIN THE REGULATED CANNABIS INDUSTRY EIGHT YEARS AGO AS A CROHN'S DISEASE SUFFER AND DOCTORAL STUDENT CANNABIS SAVE MY LIFE THEN AND STILL PROVIDES ME WITH LIFE CHANGING SYMPTOM RELIEF PARTICULARLY WHEN VAPORIZED AS A PATIENT SCHOLAR IN INDUSTRY MEMBER PLEASE HEAR ME THAT RASH ACTION ON THIS TOPIC MAY HAVE DISASTROUS FALLOUT. SINCE FIRST HEARING OF RECENT MEDICINAL CONCERN OVER VAPORIZER PRODUCTS PURE EXTRACTS BEGIN INTENSIVE RESEARCH SUPPLEMENTAL LABORATORY TESTING. AND MADE POINT REQUESTS ARE CANNABIS VENDORS TRIPPING SUPPLIERS AND CARTRIDGE PRODUCT MANUFACTURERS FOR ALL AVAILABLE RESEARCH AND SAFETY DATA. WE WELCOME YOUR FURTHER GUIDANCE IN PROTECTING OUR CONSUMER SAFETY PARTICULARLY FOCUSING ON CUTTING AGENCIES WITHIN THE ILLICIT MARKET THOUGH. INCLUDING VITAMIN A ACETAT WE STRONGLY SUPPORT ADDITIONAL LABORATORY TESTING AND CONSUMER WARNING REQUIREMENTS. WE'LL NEVER IGNORE THE WELL BEING OF OUR CONSUMERS WE ARE ALSO SINCERELY CONCERNED THOUGH ABOUT THE LIVELY ARMOR LIKELIHOODS AND THE MEDICINAL NEEDS OF OUR THOUSANDS OF CONSUMERS. PLEASE COLLABORATE WITH OUR INDUSTRY TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE AND AT WITHIN AN EVIDENCE BASED MANNER. THAT PROVIDES AN ONGOING ACCESS TO AND NINE COMBUSTED IN HELLO CANNABIS OPTION THANK YOU. HI MY NAME IS JOHN WITH LEADERSHIP I'M SPEAKING ON THE ILLICIT MARKET. THE LACK OF ENFORCEMENT A OF THIS MARKET IS NOT REALLY THE PROBLEM IS A LACK OF LICENSING IN THE CITY. SO MANY OF US THAT WERE IN THE ILLICIT MARKET IN A LOT OF THESE COMPANIES FORGET THE MAJOR COMPANIES FORGET THAT THEY WERE IN A LISTEN MARKET AT ONE POINT IN TIME AND HOW DID THEY GET THE MONEY IN ORDER TO GET THE LICENSE THAT THEY DO HAVE NOW. I'VE BEEN STRUGGLING FOR THE LAST THREE YEARS IN ORDER TO GET LICENSING IN THE INDUSTRY AND NOBODY HAS BEEN ABLE TO GIVE IT TO ME SO I'VE BEEN DOING THE BEST THAT I CAN IN ORDER TO TRY TO YOU KNOW GET THE CORRECT INFORMATION TO GET IN THE INDUSTRY. SO FOR A LOT OF US IN THE ILLICIT MARKET WE ARE DEFINITELY TRYING TO BEST WE HAVE FAMILIES WE TAKE CARE OF BUSINESS AND SO FORTH. BUT IT'S KIND OF HARD WHEN YOU HAVE PEOPLE THAT ARE IN POWER THEY CONTROL THE NARRATIVE. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME'S AND ALCOR I CHAIR THE ANTI VAPING ALLIANCE AT RIO AMERICANO HIGH SCHOOL TODAY I BROUGHT PROPS THIS IS MONTHS WORTH OF CONFISCATED DEVICES FROM THE HIGH SCHOOL. I'D TAKE THEM JUST ABOUT EVERYWHERE I GO BECAUSE I FIND THAT THEY ARE THE BEST EDUCATIONAL TOOL THAT WE HAVE IN THIS FIGHT SO IT'S A VARIETY OF NICOTINE AND MARIJUANA DEVICES AND AS WE HEARD TODAY THE STUDENTS ARE. VAPING THESE DEVICES INTERCHANGEABLY. I. I AM ASKING THAT WE DO SOMETHING URGENTLY I THINK WAITING UNTIL THE NEXT LEGISLATIVE SESSION DELAYS THIS AND WE ARE CEDING STUDENTS AND FAMILIES TRULY SUFFERING WITH ADDICTION ALREADY THEY'RE SPENDING A LOT OF MONEY ON ADDICTION COUNSELORS. TEACHERS AND ADMINISTRATORS ARE HAVING A VERY DIFFICULT TIME EDUCATING OUR KIDS BECAUSE OF THIS DISTRACTION. THE SCHOOLS NEED MORE HELP SO I ASK YOU FOR ATTENTION TO THE SCHOOLS EITHER ADDITIONAL PERSONNEL OR ADDITIONAL HELP AT THE STATE LEVEL THANK YOU. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS LAURIE BREMNER WITH THE AMERICAN CANCER SOCIETY CANCER ACTION NETWORK THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT THING THAT WE CAN DO TO TACKLE THE TEEN E. CIGARETTE EPIDEMIC IS TO PASS A POLICY THAT PROHIBITS THE SALE OF ALL FLAVORED TOBACCO PRODUCTS. SINGLE FLAVOR POLICY WITH NO EXEMPTIONS ENSURES THAT YOUTH DON'T GO FROM ONE TYPE OF TOBACCO PRODUCTS TO ANOTHER. TO CHASE THE CANDY FLAVOR THAT GOT THEM HOOKED IN THE FIRST PLACE. MINTON MENTHOL ARE EXTREMELY POPULAR AMONG YOUTH. AND EXEMPTING THOSE FLAVORS WOULD UNDERMINE ALL EFFORTS DESIGNED TO LIMIT YOUTH INITIATION. LEGISLATORS INTRODUCED TO BILLS LAST YEAR THAT WOULD HAVE PROHIBITED THE SALE OF ALL FLAVORED TOBACCO PRODUCTS BUT THEY DID NOT ADVANCE. JUL ANOTHER TOBACCO COMPANIES LOBBY FURIOUSLY AGAINST LABOR POLICIES BECAUSE THEY KNOW THEY WILL RESULT IN A REDUCTION OF TOBACCO USE IN OUR STATE. THE AMERICAN CANCER SOCIETY CANCER ACTION NETWORK HOPES THAT THE OUTCOME OF THESE HEARINGS WILL BE FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO ADOPT THE CONSENSUS. ALONG WITH THE PUBLIC HEALTH COMMUNITY AND MORE THAN FORTY CALIFORNIA CITIES THE PROHIBITING THE SALE OF ALL FLAVORED TOBACCO PRODUCTS WITH NO EXEMPTIONS IS THE BEST WAY TO COMBAT YOUTH TOBACCO ADDICTION. WE NEED A HOLE JEWEL AND THE OTHER TOBACCO COMPANIES ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE DISASTER THAT THEY'VE CAUSED BY PASSING A BILL THAT PROHIBITS THE SALE OF ALL FLAVORED TOBACCO PRODUCTS THE NEED IS URGENT. WE NEED TO GET THIS DONE. JUST TO CLARIFY AGAIN FOR THE RECORD. THERE'S A LOT OF CONFISCATING ON THIS ISSUE THAT WAS JUST ON TOBACCO OR ON ALL VAPING. I'M ADDRESSING ONLY TOBACCO AGE TOBACCO PRODUCTS BUT ALL TOBACCO PRODUCTS INCLUDING MENTHOL AND MEANT. COMBUSTIBLE CIGARETTES AS WELL. THANK YOU. HI THANKS EVERYBODY FOR COMING TOGETHER TODAY MY NAME IS MIKE CLEMENS ON THE PRESIDENT CO FOUNDER OF KILLED EXTRACTS WERE LICENSED MANUFACTURER OPEN CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN AS HAS BEEN EXPLORED TODAY CALIFORNIA SPENT YEARS CAREFULLY CRAFTING A FRAMEWORK OF REGULATORY CONTROLS TO ADDRESS THE PUBLIC HEALTH RISKS WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT TODAY LIKE THE API. I DON'T BELIEVE THAT WE'RE SEEING A FAILURE OF THESE CONTROLS I THINK THAT WE'RE SEEING THE RESULT OF A FAILURE TO ADEQUATELY SUPPORT LEGAL CANNABIS INDUSTRY WITHIN THIS FRAMEWORK THE ECONOMIC BURDENS ON THE INDUSTRY FROM THE REGULATORY LAYER HAS DRIVEN UP PRICES AND DRIVEN CONSUMERS TO CONTINUE TO PURCHASE FROM THE ILLICIT MARKET. TO MISTER COOPER'S POINT A RECENT AUDIT FOUND CLOSE TO THREE THOUSAND ILLEGAL RETAILERS IN CALIFORNIA VERSES THE EIGHT HUNDRED AND SEVENTY THREE THAT MS A TAXES TEAM AT THE BCC HAS LICENSE A LACK OF ENFORCEMENT AGAINST THE BAD ACTORS ACROSS THE STATE HAS RESULTED IN A BLACK MARKET THAT'S NOT ONLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR REGULATED. THIS IS. BUT IT ALSO. OPERATES OUTSIDE OF THE OVERSIGHT THAT SUPPOSED TO INSURE PRODUCTS CONFORM TO A SAFE STANDARD. FURTHER MORE ANY MOVE TO JUST COMPLETELY BAN ANY PRODUCT ALTOGETHER WILL ONLY EXACERBATE A DANGEROUS SITUATION BY DRIVING MORE CONSUMERS. AWAY FROM A REGULATED BUSINESSES TO THE ILLICIT SOURCES. AND IS STILL FAILS TO ADDRESS THE UNDERLYING PROBLEM OF CONTAMINATION IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN. IT WOULD BE DISASTROUS TO THE INDUSTRY AND TO THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA THAT IF IS ENTRUSTED THEIR ELECTED OFFICIALS TO WORK TOGETHER. TO MAKE THIS INDUSTRY WORK WOULD ALSO THREATEN THE ENTIRE STATE PROGRAM THAT WE'VE ALL WORKED REALLY HARD TO CREATE SO WE JUST NEED TO ENFORCE THE LAW. AND WE NEED TO MAKE COMPLIANCE LESS COSTLY FOR THE GOOD ACTORS THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MARIN BE NOW ON THE HAVE THE NAY CAN I WAS VINCE ASSIST BUSINESS ASSOCIATION WE FIVE WE'VE ACTIVELY HAVE WORKED AT TO PUSH. FOR PENALTIES UNDER PROPS. AS PROP SIXTY FOUR WAS DRAFTED ONLY TO ALLOW FOR PENALTIES FOR LEGAL. OPERATORS SO FOR THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS YOU HAD STATE AGENCIES. AND ATTORNEY GENERAL AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT NOT HAVING THE TOOLS NECESSARY TO SHUT DOWN THE LEGAL MARKET. AB NINETY SEVEN IS THE FIRST STEP THAT WE WORKED ON AB FOURTEEN SEVENTEEN WHICH- ALLOW THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. I DISTRICT ATTORNEYS IN CITY ATTORNEYS TO IMPOSE PENALTIES WAS HELD IN THE SENATE. APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE WE'VE THAT. THERE'S A CRISIS WE ARE LEGAL WE HAVE ENSURE THAT OUR PRODUCTS ARE SAFE.  A BAN ON ALL BEEPING PRODUCTS WILL ONLY PUSH PEOPLE TO THE LEGAL MARKET. WE WANTED THE RIGHT THING AND WE'VE BEEN ADVOCATING THIS FOR YEARS. AND NOW THERE'S A CRISIS. NOW PEOPLE ARE SAYING THAT THEY LEGAL MARK AND. USED TO BE SHUT DOWN THAT WE'VE BEEN ADVOCATING THAT FOR YEARS THANK YOU. THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIRMAN TIM AND REPRESENT THE CALIFORNIA CHAPTER OF THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF CARDIOLOGY AND SINCE I'M THE LAST PERSON I WILL GO TOO MUCH LONGER BUT CONSISTENT WITH WITH SOME OTHER FOLKS THAT FIVE MENTIONED WE BELIEVE IS AN ORGANIZATION THAT A BAN ON ALL VAPING PRODUCTS IS THE WAY TO GO AND LISTENING TO DR DEAN'S TESTIMONY WAR THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH IS SAYING. PEOPLE SHOULD NOT BE VAPING AT ALL ON WE THINK IS THE PRUDENT APPROACH SO WE WANT TO GET TO THE NEXT LEVEL ON THE AND WE ARE ASKING FOR BAND SIMILAR TO WHAT WAS DONE IN MASSACHUSETTS ALTHOUGH THEY DID ON A FOUR MONTH TIME FRAME ON ALL VAPING PRODUCTS. THANK THANK YOU. HELLO DEAR GEILO PRESIDENT THE UNITED CAN AS BUSINESS ASSOCIATION GONNA KEEP IT SHORT REGULATIONS ARE JUST SUGGESTIONS. WITHOUT ENFORCEMENT. THAT IS WHAT WE NEED TO FOCUS ON WE ARE TRYING TO BUILD AN INDUSTRY OR TRYING TO KEEP SAFETY AND SECURITY MONTHS ARE CONSUMERS. AND WE DON'T HAVE A GOOD ENFORCEMENT BRANCH WE ARE JUST ALLOWING THESE REGULATIONS TO JUST KIND OF GO. PASSES BY WE'RE NOT REALLY FOCUSING ON WHAT THE EFFECTS ARE NOT ONLY FOR THE INDUSTRY IS ITS GROWTH BUT ALSO THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF ITS CONSUMERS THANK YOU. THANKS FOR YOUR COMMENTS. THAT BRINGS US TO THE CONCLUSION OF PUBLIC COMMENT WILL LIVE BRING IT BACK HERE. TO THE COMMITTEE FOR CLOSING COMMENTS I'D LIKE TO. THANK CHAIRMAN WOULD CHAIRMAN LOW I THINK THIS IS BEEN. VERY INFORMATIVE HEARING I KNOW IT'S BEEN A LONG. AFTERNOON BUT THIS IS A TREMENDOUSLY MPORTANT SUBJECT I KNOW WE ALL SHARE. A DESIRE TO MOVE FORWARD. WITH SOME SOLUTIONS IN CONCRETE. ACTIVITY VIA EARLY IN THE LEGISLATIVE YOUR NEXT YEAR SO. THANK YOU AGAIN GERMAN KNOWLEDGE YOU MAKES CLOSING REMARKS. I JUST THINK YOU TO MY COLLEAGUES FOR WORKING WITH US TO PUT THIS TOGETHER OBVIOUSLY. WHEN YOU FILL THE ROOM AND NOT LET IN A AND I'M NOT LEGISLATIVE SESSION. YOU CLEARLY HAVE A TOPIC OF INTEREST AND- APPRECIATE THE INFORMATION WE LEARN TODAY WE WILL USE THIS TO. CRAFT A AN ADDITIONAL HEARING. TO EXPLORE THIS ISSUE FURTHER. AND JUST SO PEOPLE KNOW WE ARE NOT IN SESSION. WE CANNOT TAKE ANY SORT OF LEGISLATIVE ACTION NOW. UNTIL WE RECONVENE IN JANUARY THAT'S JUST THE WAY THE- IT WORKS SO. WE APPRECIATE EVERYBODY'S ATTENDS HERE ALL OF OUR PANELISTS EVERYBODY WHO CAME AND MANY PEOPLE CAME FROM A LONG DISTANCE TO. PARTICIPATE TODAY I THINK IT'S BEEN REALLY VALUABLE INFORMATION AND- LOOK FORWARD. TO EVERY CONVENE AND ASK US IN THIS PROJECT THANK YOU SO MUCH. WITH THAT WORD WITH THAT WERE INJURED
