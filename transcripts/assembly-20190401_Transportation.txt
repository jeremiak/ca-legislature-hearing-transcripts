TRANSPORTATION COMMITTEE. A WELCOME EVERYBODY WE HAVE ONE AUTHOR ASSEMBLY MEMBER MELENDEZ. THAT IS -- AB. FIVE FIVE THREE PLEASE. PROCEED TO THE PODIUM AND WE'RE GOING TO START AS A SUB COMMITTEE BECAUSE WE DON'T OF A QUORUM ASSUMES WE DO WE WILL. STOP THE PROCEEDINGS TO ESTABLISH A QUORUM BUT GOOD AFTERNOON. AND PLEASE -- OR AT YOUR pCONVENIENCE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. MY WITNESSES ARE MAKING THEIR WAY UP HERE TO THE PODIUM THANK. HERE THEY COME. OKAY M. AND I AM HERE TO DATE TO ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT OF AB FIVE FIVE THREE WHICH ALLOWS VOTERS TO DECIDE WHETHER THEY WANT TO CONTINUE SPENDING. UP ON FINDING ON CALIFORNIA'S HIGH SPEED RAIL OR WHETHER TO PRIORITIZE THEIR SPINES TOWARDS MULTI FAMILY HOUSING -- AS YOU KNOW THE HIGH SPEED RAIL PROJECT HAS CHANGED DRAMATICALLY WORD IS NOW AND HOW. YOU MAY SIT DOWN LADIES I'M SORRY. SHE HAS A BABY IN HER HANDS TO SO -- THE THE THE PROJECT IS NOW YOU KNOW NO LONGER WHAT IT WAS SOLD TO TO THE VOTERS IT'S NOW FROM THE CENTRAL VALLEY -- IT'S IT'S A CENTRAL VALLEY PORTION OF THE PROJECT WHICH IS VASTLY DIFFERENT THAN WHAT THE VOTERS AGREED TO AND WE DID NOT. AGREE TO A TRAIN FROM MERCED TO BAKERSFIELD I DO KNOW THAT SEC. GIVEN THAT I THINK WE AS CALIFORNIANS IN AS ASSEMBLY MEMBERS NEED TO RE PRIORITIZE WHERE THIS MONEY IS GOING I'M I HAVE WITH ME TODAY SOME PEOPLE WHO ARE DIRECTLY AFFECTED. BY THIS PROJECT THAT I AND I WANT THEM TO SHARE WITH YOU THEIR EXPERIENCE -- BUT I FIRST I WANT TO TALK ABOUT A COUPLE OTHERS -- WHO AREN'T HERE WITH THIS TODAY SHOW HALF WHICH WAS PLANNING ON SELLING HER HOME -- IN MADERA ONCE SHE RETIRED AND IT WAS INITIALLY PRAISE FOR FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS AND THEN THE HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY TOLD HER THAT THE TRAIN WAS GOING TO BE BUILT ON HER PROPERTY. WITHIN THE NEXT FEW YEARS SO OF COURSE SHE TRIED TO SELL IT AND THE REALTORS FOUND IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO SELL THAT HOME ONCE PEOPLE DISCOVERED THAT THEY WOULD EVENTUALLY HAVE TO MOVE BECAUSE OF THE TRAIN. AND THEN THE AUTHORITY -- CAME IN AND SAID WHAT WE WILL BUY YOUR HOME BUT THEY ONLY OFFER TO BUY THE HOME FOR ABOUT A THIRD OF ITS VALUE. SO IT'S A LOSE LOSE ON BOTH ENDS FOR PEOPLE LIKE THIS. MITCH HUTCHERSON WAS THE OWNER OF RIVERSIDE NURSERY AND DECIDED TO CLOSE HIS BUSINESS DOWN AFTER THIRTY FIVE YEARS OF OPERATION BECAUSE THEY COULD NOT AFFORD THE RELOCATION COSTS. IF THAT'S YOUR LIVELIHOOD OF THAT'S IT'S PAYING THE BILLS IN YOUR FAMILY YOU'RE TOLD YOU HAVE TO MOVE BECAUSE THE TRAIN IS GOING TO GO TO YOUR PROPERTY AND YOU CAN'T AFFORD TO MOVE YOUR BUSINESS. YOUR LIVELIHOOD IS NOW GONE TO THAT A TRAIN THAT DOESN'T EXIST YET CAN GO THROUGH YOUR PROPERTY. AND THEY WERE CLOSE THEY WERE FORCED TO CLOSE THEIR BUSINESS DOWN. AND THEN THERE IS ALSO A KEY LIMÃ³N CAN SHARE YOU OWN FRESNO AS LONG TIME STANDING RESTAURANT IN JEWELERS DINER IN FRESNO SOME OF YOU MAY BE AWARE OF THAT. THEY SOLD THE BUSINESS TO THE HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY FOR ABOUT HALF OF WHAT IT WOULD HAVE TAKEN THEM TO RELOCATE AND HAD TO CLOSER BUSINESS AFTER SIXTY YEARS. SO THESE ARE JUST A FEW -- AS STORIES THERE ARE MANY -- BUT I WANTED SHARE THEM WITH YOU TODAY I DO HAVE TWO WITNESSES WITH ME THOUGH -- HE WILL TELL YOU THEIR OWN STORY -- RATIO DEBT MORE FROM THE CITY OF REFUGE IN OAK PARK SACRAMENTO AND ISABELLA GARCIA WHO CURRENTLY LIVES IN ONE OF THE CITY OF REFUGE. REFUGES TRANSITIONAL HOUSING PROGRAMS THIS IS THIS IS A DIRECT AFFECT ON THEIR LIVES AND I WOULD JUST ASK THAT YOU GIVE THEM YOUR THOUGHTFUL ATTENTION AND LISTEN TO HOW. THIS HAS IMPACTED THEIR DAILY LIFE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HAVING US HERE TODAY MY NAME IS MICHELLE DEBT MORE AND I AM AT THE FOUNDER AT CITY OF REFUGE IN SACRAMENTO ALONG WITH MY HUSBAND LEARNED IT MORE. AND WE'VE BEEN IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD FOR NINETEEN YEARS AND OUR COMMITMENT TO HOUSING WAS ACTUALLY NOT A PART OF OUR BEGINNING AT RAND IT STARTED WITH AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS AND ABOUT NINE YEARS AGO -- BUT WE SAW A TREND OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING REALLY BEGAN TO SPREAD ACROSS -- OUR STATE OUR NATION AND OVER THE COURSE OF ONE YEAR WE HAD SEVENTEEN YOUNG WOMEN WHO WERE EIGHTEEN YEARS AND OLDER THAT HAD. SHOWN UP AT OUR DOOR NEEDING REFUGE AND EATING HOUSING AND EATING A SECOND CHANCE AND SO WE STARTED WITH A LITTLE TWO BEDROOM ONE BATH HOUSE AND WE BEGAN. I TAKING THESE YOUNG WOMEN IN. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE FOUND -- AS WE BELIEVE THAT PEOPLE PEOPLE ARE AN ASSET PEOPLE ARE NOT OUR PROBLEM. AND FUTURE GENERATIONS ARE AN ASSET TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND WHEN WE LOOK AT THE NEED FOR HOUSING AND OUR COMMITMENT FOR HOUSING IN CALIFORNIA AND SAFE AFFORDABLE HOUSING. IT REALLY TAKES A PERSPECTIVE THAT PEOPLE ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT ASSET THAT LIVES ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT ASSET AND THAT WE AS A STATE ARE GOING TO BE COMMITTED TO FUTURE GENERATIONS. I'M ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE FOUND AS WE BEGIN TO TAKE THESE YOUNG WOMEN AND WE TO DATE HAVE TAKEN AND THREE HUNDRED AND TWENTY SEVEN WOMEN INTO OUR HOUSING PROGRAM. WAS AT THAT NEXT STEP FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING WAS REALLY NOT AN OPTION -- WE CAN PASS BILLS ON HUMAN TRAFFICKING BUT IN LAST WE HAVE AN OPTION FOR HEALTHY AND SAFE COMMUNITIES -- WE CAN'T STOP SUCH ATROCITIES IN OUR IN OUR STATE. I'M WE'D THEN OPENED UP ART TRANSITIONAL HOUSING PROGRAM YOU KNOW PARK WHICH WAS A SEVEN BEDROOM FOUR BATH HOUSE WHICH THIS LITTLE ASSET RIGHT HERE HI SERAPHINE I LIVED IN OUR HOUSING PROGRAM. AND AT IT WAS PURELY GIVING YOUNG WOMEN THE CHANCE TO REBUILD THEIR LIVES IN THE CONTEXT OF A COMMUNITY. THAT WAS RAPIDLY CHANGING. WHEN WE LOOK AT COMMUNITIES ACROSS CALIFORNIA WE SEE CITIES LIKE OAKLAND AND SACRAMENTO IN LOS ANGELES WHERE WE'RE SEEING COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE BEEN REDEVELOPED? GENTRIFIED SOME PEOPLE CHOOSE TO USE THAT WORD. BUT I BELIEVE THAT IF WE ARE INTENTIONAL ABOUT REBUILDING HEALTHY COMMUNITIES WHERE PEOPLE CAN AFFORD TO LIVE AND TO PARTICIPATE IN TO BE A PART OF IT WE WILL SEE. SYSTEMIC ISSUES BEGAN TO CHANGE WE WILL SEE EDUCATION BEGAN TO CHANGE WE WILL SEE. I GENERATIONS OF HOMELESSNESS BEGAN TO CHANGE AND SELL THAT IS OUR REQUEST -- THAT YOU WOULD CONSIDER -- PUTTING FINDING TOWARDS BUILDING HEALTHY COMMUNITIES WHERE FRIENDS LIKE MY FRIEND ISABELLA CAN LIVE AND SHE CAN SEE HER CHILDREN -- CONTINUE IN A TRAJECTORY OR CYCLES OF ABUSE. AND HORROR DO NOT CONTINUE. BUT THEY BECOME OUR FUTURE LEADERS OF OUR STATE. I'M GONNA PUT A PAUSE ON THE TESTIMONY WE'RE GOING.

I'LL JUST GET TO THE CHASE THE TO THE SHORT CHASE OF IT IS THE THE THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF ISSUES SURROUNDING THE PROJECT. I THINK THAT WE'VE SEEN SOME CHANGES IN LEADERSHIP THAT THIS GOVERNOR HAS COMMITTED TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL OVERSIGHT.

AND HOUSING IS CRITICAL AS IT IS AS THE GOVERNOR ALSO STATED IS TIED TO OUR TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM WE HAVE CONGESTION ON THE ROADS WE HAVE CONGESTION IN THE SKIES.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR IN THE THANK YOU -- TO THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD AS WELL AS FOR THE WITNESSES AND THEY'RE VERY EMOTIONAL APPEAL -- FOR HOUSING I JUST WANTED TO BE ABLE TO GO ON RECORD -- TO BE ABLE TO STATE THAT -- OBVIOUSLY HOUSING IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT. THAT HOWEVER TO TRY TO SILO HOUSING AND TRANSPORTATION TO WHERE THEY'RE NOT INTEGRATED AND WORK TOGETHER RATHER THAN AGAINST EACH OTHER IS NOT PRODUCTIVE FOR THE WHOLE PICTURE. AND AS WAS STATED IN TESTIMONY WHERE WE DO HAVE HOUSING -- I HAVE RAN SEVERAL HOUSING BILLS MYSELF AND AND ENJOYED THE THE BENEFIT OF SUPPORT OF MY COLLEAGUES TO BUILD A MOVE CERTAIN HOUSING BILLS FORWARD THAT HAVE BEEN A PART OF THE THE PACKAGE IN. TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN AND THEN ALSO TO BE ABLE TO MAKE SURE THAT -- BY CHOOSING ONE I DIDN'T DENY OR REJECT THE OTHER I THINK BEING ABLE TO UNDERSTAND THAT TRANSPORTATION IS JUST AS IMPORTANT. AS HOUSING IN MANY INSTANCES AND THAT HOUSING -- WITHOUT TRANSPORTATION -- IS IS NOT REALLY BENEFITING THE HOSTED A CALIFORNIA'S FAR AS THE QUALITY OF LIFE AS WELL AS SITUATIONS IN YOUR VERY INSTANCE SO WITH THAT SAID -- I AM SUPPORTIVE OF TRANSPORTATION AND I'M SUPPORTIVE OF PROJECTS THAT HELP US MOVE AND TO BE ABLE. TO CONNECT HOUSING COMMUNITIES TOGETHER AS WELL AS BEING ABLE SUPPORT HOUSING IN THE RIGHT VENUES AND IN THE RIGHT MECHANISMS. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OF THE AUTHOR FROM COMMITTEE SEEING NONE. SOMEWHERE WAS LIKE CLOSE I WOULD THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND AND AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR YOUR THOUGHTFUL COMMENTS DAY I UNDERSTAND. IT'S A TOUGH CALL BECAUSE YOU'RE FOR HOUSING YOUR FOR AT YOU KNOW TRANSPORTATION AND THEY ARE ALL INTER TWINED WHAT I WILL SAY TO YOU THOUGH IS THAT -- IF THERE IS NO HOUSING THERE IS NOTHING TO CONNECT. TO WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A TRAIN IN A TRAIN BUILT IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY DOESN'T HELP THOSE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA DOESN'T HELP THOSE IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WE ARE NUMBER ONE IN POVERTY IN THE NATION WE HAVE THE MOST NUMBER OF HOMELESS PEOPLE IN THE NATION. THAT IS A TRAVESTY AND THIS BILL LIKE MANY OTHERS FRANKLY TOOK TO GIVE FULL CREDIT WHERE CREDIT IS DUE LIKE MANY OTHERS THIS BILL SEEKS TO ADDRESS THAT ISSUE BECAUSE WE CAN'T CONTINUE TO IGNORE THAT. RIGHT -- AND I DON'T DISAGREE WITH YOU THAT TRANSPORTATION IS A IMPORTANT OBVIOUSLY IT IS BUT I ALSO DON'T THINK THAT THERE'S ANYTHING WRONG WITH PUTTING THIS BACK BEFORE THE VOTERS. TO GIVE THEM ANOTHER CHANCE TO WEIGH IN ON THIS -- AND GIVEN THE FACT THAT THERE HAS BEEN SO MUCH MEDIA ATTENTION GIVEN TO OUR HOMELESS SITUATION THAT IS NOT GETTING BETTER IT IS GETTING WORSE. AND THE FACT THAT WE HAVE SUCH A HIGH NUMBER OF PEOPLE LIVING IN POVERTY. I THINK THE VOTERS DESERVE THE CHANCE TO HAVE THIS PUT BEFORE THEM AGAIN AND MAKE THEIR DECISION IT IS IT'S THEIR MONEY THEY ARE THE ONES THAT APPROVED THE PROJECT IN THE FIRST PLACE. CERTAINLY WE SHOULD GIVE THEM THE OPPORTUNITY TO VOTE ON THIS AGAIN -- AND I JUST I THINK WE OWE IT TO THEM TO DO THAT I DON'T THINK IT'S IRRESPONSIBLE I FRANKLY THINK IT'S A BIT DISRESPECTFUL TO NOT PUT IT BEFORE THEN GIVEN THE FACT THAT. THE HOUSING CRISIS HAS GONE ON FOR SO LONG AND IN CALIFORNIA AND WE ALL AGREE WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT RIGHT. SO WITH THAT SAID I APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS -- BUT I AM HERE TO RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE [inaudible] A MOTION. SO I HAVE A A MOTION BY SUMMER FONG AS SECOND BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER.

A MEMORIAL ROUNDABOUTS -- CAN ALSO BE FOUND THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES. THERE HAVE BEEN NO REPORTED ISSUES IN MASSACHUSETTS THE COMMUNITY OF FREETOWN. FOUGHT TO CREATE A WRAP AROUND ABOUT IT IN THE TORY ASLI DANGEROUS FOUR WAY INTERSECTION. AND WORK WITH THE STATE AND LOCAL OFFICIALS TO DEDICATE THAT ROUND ABOUT IN HONOR.

MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I AM PLEASED TO PRESENT. AB. ELEVEN SIXTY SEVEN THIS MEASURE WOULD SERVE [inaudible] WOULD SEVER. THE HIGH SPEED ROLES FUNDING. FROM GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUND. MEMBERS WE ARE ALL AWARE OF THE RECENT DEVELOPMENTS WITH THE HIGH SPEED RAIL PROJECT. IT IS CLEAR THAT THE PROJECT HAS FAILED TO ACCOMPLISH EVEN COME CLOSE TO ACCOMPLISHING VOTER INTENT. MISTER CHAIR EVEN. YOU HAVE STATED THAT THE AUTHORITY. NEEDS INCREASED ACCOUNTABILITY AND OVERSIGHT. AND I APPLAUD YOUR WORK IN LEADERSHIP ON TRYING TO BRING THE RELIC FORTY INTO COMPLIANCE. HOWEVER IS BECOME FAR TOO APPARENT THE MORE TIME WILL BE NEEDED TO FIX THE AUTHORITY. IF. IT EVEN CAN BE FIXED. AS SUCH WE ALL NEED TO LOOK AT ITS CURRENT FUNDING SOURCE AND SEE IF. THE AUTHORITY DESERVES THESE FUNDS. THE QUESTION I MUST GAS. WHAT ARE WE REALLY FUNDING? MISTER CHAIR. YOU AGAIN RECOGNIZE THE FLAWED DECISION MAKING AND THAT POOR CONTRACT MANAGEMENT BY THE AUTHORITY HAS LED TO BILLIONS. AND COST OVERRUNS AND DELAYS. ALL OF THIS SPELLS WASTED TAXPAYER DOLLARS IN THE BILLIONS. AGAIN I ASK WHAT ARE WE REALLY PAYING. FOR I HAVE COME TO THE UNDERSTANDING. THAT WE ARE WASTING AN R. G. G. R. F. MONIES. ON THIS BOONDOGGLE OF A PROJECT AND MEMBERS. I DIDN'T SUPPORT THE CAP AND TRADE REVISION. SO WE COULD THROW THE MONEY AWAY. INSTEAD I'D LIKE TO SEVER FUNDING FROM THE HIGH SPEED RAIL AND SEND IT TO CAL FIRE. WHERE IT'LL ACTUALLY BE PUT TO GOOD USE? AS WE ARE ALL TO AWARE MASSIVE AND DEVASTATING WILDFIRES ARE BECOMING ALL TOO COMMON IN OUR STATE. SADLY IT IS RESULTED. IN AN UNACCEPTABLE LOSS OF LIFE. A LARGE CONTRIBUTE FACTOR. TO THIS DISASTER SITUATION IS FOUND WITHIN OUR FOREST TODAY. WE HAVE A MASS PROBLEM WITH ARE FORCED HEALTH. AND COMPLACENCY IS NOT MAKING IT ANY BETTER. AND ONLY WORSE. SIMPLY PUT. LEAVING OUR FORCE MANAGEMENT ON MANAGED. IS NO LONGER A SAFE OPTION. WE CAN AND MUST DO A BETTER JOB. OF PROTECTING BOTH THE FOREST AND THE COMMUNITIES OF THE URBAN WILDLAND INTERFACE. ONE WAY THAT WE CAN ACCOMPLISH THIS. IS BY ADDICT QUICK LEE FUNDING CAL FIRE. I AM VERY GRATEFUL TO SEE THE GOVERNOR NEWSOME RECOGNIZES THAT NEED. TO CLEAR OUT DEAD TREES BY DECLARING A STATE OF EMERGENCY THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. AHEAD OF THE COMING FIRE SEASON. EXECUTIVE ORDER IN ZERO FIVE ONE NINE CREWS ARE STATE'S COMMITMENT TO REDUCING FIRE FUELS THAT ARE STILL PLAGUING OUR COMMUNITIES TODAY. ONE SUCH WAY THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO ADDRESS THE STATE OF EMERGENCY AND PREVENT FUTURE EMERGENCIES. AS THROUGH THE SUPPLEMENT TOLL FUNDING. TO CAL FIRE FUND WITHIN AB. ELEVEN SIXTY SEVEN WITH THE FUNDING WE CAN HIRE MORE FIREFIGHTERS AND PURCHASE NEW EQUIPMENT. WE CAN BETTER PROTECT OUR BRAVE FIREFIGHTERS AND OUR COMMUNITIES. ALSO I'M INCLUDED A PROVISION WHICH WOULD HELP FIREFIGHTERS WHO HAVE LOST THEIR HOMES WHAT DEPLOYED TO REBUILD AND REGAIN A SENSE OF NORMALCY. MEMBERS THIS FUNDING FOR CAL FIRE IS LONG OVERDUE. I ASK YOU TO JOIN ME TODAY. AND SUPPORTING THIS MEASURE TO ENSURE ADEQUATE FUNDING FOR CAL FIRE [inaudible] I ASK. YOU TO JOIN. OUR GOVERNOR IN RECOGNIZING. THIS STATE OF EMERGENCY THAT WE ARE AN BUT I ASK YOU FOR YOUR AYE VOTES THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER MATHIS. WITH THIS PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME AND WE REPRESENT PLEASE. COURSE MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS GOOD AFTERNOON DAVID WILL FOR THE HOWARD JARVIS TAXPAYERS ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT OF AB ELEVEN SIXTY SEVEN HERE TODAY AND AS THAT MISTER MATHIS NOTED -- ADDITIONAL MONEY TO FIGHT WILDFIRES IS VERY MUCH NEEDED WE KNOW EIGHTY NINE A ONE LAST YEAR DEVOTED ABOUT A BILLION DOLLARS -- TO DO BRUSH ACCORDING TO DO THINGS LIKE TREE REMOVAL BUT CLEARLY AND I THINK THE GOVERNOR'S EMERGENCY DECLARATION MAKES GOOD NOTE OF THIS THAT MONEY WAS NOT SUFFICIENT AND MORE IS NEEDED. THE WHOLE POINT OF CAP AND TRADE MEMBERS IS TO FIGHT EMISSIONS AND PROMOTE EMISSION REDUCTIONS AND WHAT BETTER WAY TO DO THAT. THAN -- TO YOU KNOW INSURE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS -- THROUGH PUTTING OUT WILD FIRES FASTER AND ENSURING THAT THEY DON'T EVEN HAPPENED AT ALL CONTINUES TO OCCUR -- I THINK THAT'S INTO A COMPLETELY APPROPRIATE USE OF CAP AND TRADE DOLLARS AND CERTAINLY MORE. EFFICIENT AND BETTER THAN HIGH SPEED RAIL THERE WAS TWO THOUSAND SEVEN REPORT MISTER CHAIRMAN DONE BY. THE REASON FOUNDATION ON HIGH SPEED RAIL THAT MAKES IT CLEAR THAT A STATE -- HIGH SPEED RAIL SYSTEM BETWEEN SAN FRANCISCO AND SAN DIEGO WILL ROOM WILL RESULT IN A NET INCREASE OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS -- NOW YOU LOOK AT THE WILD FIRES FROM LAST YEAR SIXTY EIGHT MILLION TIMES. OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AS A RESULT OF THESE FIRES CARBON EMISSIONS -- THAT'S ROUGHLY THE AMOUNT OF ENERGY THAT IT TAKES TO GENERATE ALL THE ELECTRICITY IN THE STATE FOR ONE YEAR. IT SEEMS LIKE MORE MONEY FOR FIREFIGHTERS MORE MONEY FOR BRUSH REMOVAL MORE MONEY FOR THESE THINGS IS A COMPLETELY WONDERFUL USED TO CAP AND TRADE FUNDS WE ASK THE MONEY WOULD GO THERE AND WOULD ASK FOR AN AYE. THANKS SIR ANY OTHER MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC FEEL LIKE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THE AUTHORS BILL. SEEING NONE ANY MEMBERS THE PUBLIC LIKE TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION OR SHARE CONCERNS WITH AUTHORS.

AS MENTIONED -- AFTER THEIR REPORT COMES OUT AT THE END OF MAY WE ARE BUILDING AND INVESTING IN A POLICY OF REDUCING OUR CLIMATE FOOTPRINT THE PART OF THAT IS A TRANSFORMATIVE INNOVATIVE.

REDUCTION FUND TO SUPPORT THE CLEARING OF TREES AND THE CONSTRUCTION OF HOMES NEITHER OF THESE YEAR USES ENSURE AND NEXUS BETWEEN THE EXPENDITURE AND THE NEED TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. THE PROGRAM IS PROMOTED IN AB ELEVEN SIXTY SEVEN WOULD NOT DIRECTLY REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS IN THE NEAR TERM. NOR WOULD THEY INSURE REDUCTIONS OVER TIME. AN UNDERLYING ASSUMPTION OF TE BILL'S EXPENDITURE PROPOSAL IS THAT FOREST SUFFERING FROM BEETLE INFESTATION AND DROUGHT IMPACTS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE RECENT MEGA FIRES. THAT HAVE DOES DEVASTATED SANTA ROSA PARADISE AND OTHER POPULATED PARTS THE STATE THIS ASSUMPTION IS FAULTY AND IS BEING USED THROUGHOUT THE CAPITAL TO PUSH MEASURES THAT ARE HARMFUL FOR THE FOREST ECOSYSTEM. THE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUND IS A VALUABLE MECHANISM FOR ACHIEVING CALIFORNIA'S CLIMATE GOALS. THE STATE MUST ENSURE THAT THE FUNDING SUPPORT SOLUTIONS THAT ARE PROVEN AND EFFECTIVE IN REDUCING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS IN THE NEAR TERM THANK YOU.

I THANK YOU. SOON -- WE'RE GONNA MOVE ON TO AB [inaudible] TWELVE SIXTY SEVEN THIS MR CHAD THANK YOU COLLEAGUES. THE COMMITTEE STAFF THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK ON THIS -- BILL IN THE ANALYSIS. YOU KNOW I'M HERE THIS AFTERNOON TO PRESENT ASSEMBLY BILL TWELVE SIXTY SEVEN WHICH IS LEGISLATION SEEKING TO UPDATE CALIFORNIA SUCCESSFUL. PROVISIONAL LICENSING PROGRAM OTHERWISE KNOWN AS PDL. NOW I FOR ONE THING MY FRIEND CHAIRMAN FRAZIER -- BECAUSE THIS LEGISLATION -- AB TWELVE SIXTY SEVEN MAY HAVE ROBERT RIVAS AS THE AUTHOR -- BUT THIS BILL -- CERTAINLY -- THIS IDEA IS NOT NEW -- FOR SEVERAL YEARS CHAIRMAN FRAZIER HAS PROVIDED INCREDIBLE LEADERSHIP -- ON THIS ISSUE. I AND WITH HIS HELP HIS GUIDANCE I BELIEVE WE WERE WE ARE ON OUR WAY TO MAKING THE CHANGES -- TO HAVING THE IMPROVEMENTS THAT WILL ULTIMATELY SAVE YOUNG DRIVERS LIVES SO FOR THAT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN. RECENTLY PUBLISHED STUDY IN THE NEW ENGLAND JOURNAL OF MEDICINE AND ACCORDING TO THE DATA FROM THE US. THE CENTERS -- FOR THE DISEASE CONTROL PREVENTION. THE MAJOR CAUSE OF DEATH IN CHILDREN AGED ONE TO NINETEEN IN THE UNITED STATES IS NOT CANCER. OR ANOTHER MEDICAL CONDITION IT'S INJURY. INJURY RELATED TO DEATH SUCH AS TRAFFIC ACCIDENT FATALITIES. DRUG OVERDOSES HOMICIDES AND SUICIDES. BUT IT'S TRAFFIC ACCIDENTS THAT OVERWHELMINGLY ACCOUNT. FOR A SIGNIFICANT PERCENTAGE OF THOSE UNINTENDED INJURY DEATHS OF OUR YOUNG PEOPLE. CALIFORNIA IS NO EXCEPTION. ACCORDING TO THE CENTER FOR DISEASE FOR THE THE DISEASE CONTROL AND THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH. DRIVER INVOLVED ACCIDENTS ARE THE LEADING CAUSE OF INJURY AND DEATH OF OUR YOUNG PEOPLE IN THE STATE. THE DATA IS CRYSTAL CLEAR AND ACCORDING TO SEVERAL SUBJECT AREA EXPERTS FROM PUBLIC SAFETY. HEALTH CARE PUBLIC HEALTH. INSURANCE COMPANIES YOUTH ADVOCATES SEVERAL FACTORS HAVE LED AND WILL CONTINUE TO LEAD. IN A DISPROPORTIONATE NUMBER OF YOUNG PEOPLE INVOLVED IN MOTOR VEHICLE ACCIDENTS. AND AMONG THOSE ARE. AMONG THOSE FACTORS IMMATURITY. LACK OF DRIVING EXPERIENCE NIGHT DRIVING. DRIVING WITH OTHER TEEN PASSENGERS. THE PERVASIVENESS OF CELL PHONE USE WHILE DRIVING. OTHERWISE KNOWN AS DISTRACTED -- DRIVING. AND FINALLY TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN A LIBERTY MUTUAL STUDY FOUND THAT IN ADDITION TO ALL THESE FACTORS. OLDER TEENAGERS ARE MORE LIKELY TO ENGAGE AND DANGEROUS BEHAVIORS WHILE BEHIND THE WHEEL FINALLY. SO WHEN WE DATE BACK TO THE MID NINETEEN NINETIES. THE STATE'S BEGAN TO ENACT A GRADUATED DRIVER'S LICENSE LAWS HELLO I KNOW THAT AS THE GDL. THEY DID THIS TO HELP CONTROL THE PROBLEM RELATED TO YOUTH RELATED INJURY ACCIDENTS. AND TO DATE EVERY SINGLE STATE IN THIS COUNTRY HAS SOME KIND OF GDL LAW. AND HERE CALIFORNIA OUR VERSION OF THE G. D. L. IS KNOWN AS THE PDL THE PROVISIONAL DRIVER'S LICENSE PROGRAM. AND SINCE NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT PDL REQUIREMENTS CONSIST OF A RIGOROUS LEARNING PERIOD -- AND THAT'S DONE. BEFORE GRANT TO YOUNG PEOPLE BETWEEN SIX TO EIGHTEEN YEARS OLD WITH A DRIVER'S LICENSE THAT CONTAINS FULL PRIVILEGES. AND SO THE LICENSEE PROCESS IN CALIFORNIA INCLUDES THREE STAGES THE FIRST IS A LEARNER'S PERMIT. STAGE TWO IS A PROVISIONAL LICENSE AND STAGE THREE IS A FULL LICENSE. AND CALIFORNIA'S BL PROGRAM HAS SAVED LIVES. AND HAS HAD A REMARKABLE IMPACT ON REDUCING THE NUMBER OF YOUNG DRIVER BECAUSE VEHICLE ACCIDENTS. RESEARCH HAS SUGGESTED THAT YOUNG DRIVERS WHO CHOOSE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PL PROGRAM HAVE 55% FEWER FATAL CRASHES. THE NOVICE EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY YEAR OLD DRIVERS WHO CHOOSE TO WAIT AND BYPASS THE PDL PROGRAM ALTOGETHER. AND TODAY AT LEAST ONE THREE DRIVERS WICKS INTEL AFTER TURNING AGE EIGHTEEN TO GET A LICENSE. TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM OUR STATE STRATEGIC HIGHWAY SAFETY PLAN. RECOMMENDS EXTENDING THE PDL. PROGRAM TO THE AGE OF TWENTY ONE THUS COVERING EIGHTEEN NINETEEN AND TWENTY YEAR OLDS. AND IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THIS BILL. FOLLOWS THIS RECOMMENDATION. IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THIS BILL TWELVE SIXTY SEVEN AB TWELVE SIXTY SEVEN CRATE A FAST TRACK PDL PROGRAM FOR THIS NEW AGE GROUP. AND TO EMPHASIZE EACH PDL STAGES SHORTEN THE LEARNER'S PERMIT PHASE IS SIXTY DAYS NOT SIX MONTHS. THE PROVISIONAL LICENSE PHASES SIX MONTHS NOT TWELVE MONTHS. AND FINALLY I WANT TO BRIEFLY COMMENT ON THE BILL ANALYSIS PREPARED BY COMMITTEE STAFF THE PART OF THE ANALYSIS THAT CORRECTLY POINTS OUT THAT THE DMV HAS FINANCIAL CHALLENGES. FINANCIAL CHALLENGES THAT AB TWELVE SIXTY SEVEN TOOK INTO ACCOUNT. AND I'M PROUD THAT THIS BILL CONTAINS COST. BY PROVIDING THE MEANS TO PAY FOR ALL SUCH BUDGET INCREASES DUE TO THIS PDF EXTENSION. THIS IS MADE POSSIBLE IN THIS BILL BY THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE DMB AND DRIVER EDUCATION SCHOOLS. ALSO I SHOULD SAY THAT I STRONGLY STRONGLY SUPPORT THE GOVERNOR'S EFFORT TO REINVENT THE DEPARTMENT OF MOTOR VEHICLES. THE DMV'S CHRONIC MISMANAGEMENT HAS BEEN WELL DOCUMENTED. BUT IN NO WAY IN NO WAY. SHOULD THIS PRIOR MISMANAGEMENT OF THE DMV IMPEDE GOOD POLICY CHANGES. CHANGES THAT WILL HELP SAVE YOUNG WIVES AND MAKE OUR STREETS MAKE OUR HIGHWAYS A SAFER PLACE FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS. IN SO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND COMMITTEE HERE WITH ME I HAVE THREE WITNESSES AND I WILL ALLOW THEM TO INTRODUCE HIMSELF BECAUSE I WILL JUST PUT YOUR THEIR NAMES I'M SURE SEVERELY. THANK YOU MISTER PLEASE PROCEED THE HI. MY NAME IS STEVE BERYL AND I'M THE PROGRAM DIRECTOR FOR THE CALIFORNIA COALITION FOR CHILDREN'S SAFETY AND HEALTH. AND WHEN THE LEAD STAFF PEOPLE IN THIS WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON THIS -- ALONG WITH -- THE CHAIR AND THE AUTHOR FOR A LONG TIME NOW -- IT'S A LONG TIME COMING I'M ALSO HERE -- ALSO ON ON A ON BEHALF OF IMPACTING DRIVERS WHICH IS -- THE OTHER CO AUTHOR OF THE OF THE BILL AND THEY COULDN'T BE HERE WE HAVE A MAJOR EVENT ON THIS ISSUE ON WEDNESDAY -- NATIONAL EVENT -- BY AM JOINED HERE AT THE TABLE WITH KATHY BARRANCA LETTER INTRODUCED HERSELF SHE'S A CO CHAIR OF THE CALIFORNIA UNINTENTIONAL INJURY PREVENTION STRATEGIC PLAN PROJECT WE TRY TO GET A LONGER NAME FOR THAT. PROJECT BUT WE COULDN'T GET ENOUGH WORDS -- AND WHAT THAT PROJECT IS IS TO TRY TO END UNINTENTIONAL INJURY AS A LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH IN HOSPITALIZATION OF OUR CHILDREN UP THROUGH THE AGE OF NINETEEN THERE ARE EIGHT LEADING CAUSES OF DEATH THAT TAKE THE LIVES AND HOSPITALIZED WITH SEVERE INJURIES OUR CHILDREN. HERE IN CALIFORNIA. TEEN DRIVER INVOLVED CRASHES AND YOUTH DRIVER INVOLVED CRASHES IS BY FAR THE LEADING CAUSE IF WE'RE EVER GOING TO GET THE UNINTENTIONAL INJURY NOT TO BE THE LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH IN HOSPITALIZATION. WE HAVE TO SOLVE THIS ISSUE FIRST AS THE AUTHOR HAS SO LAID OUT SO ELOQUENTLY THE COMPONENTS OF THIS AND IT IS IT SOMETHING THAT YOU IF THIS BILL PASSES AND WHEN IT PASSES. 55% REDUCTION ON TEEN DRIVER CAUSED CRASH FATALITIES WILL TAKE PLACE YOU LITERALLY ARE GOING TO BE VOTING ON SOMETHING THAT LITERALLY WILL KEEP HUNDREDS OF TEENS ALIVE EVERY YEAR. I'M ONLY GOING TO CALM IT GETS THESE ARE THE AUTHORS ALREADY COMMENTED ON A NUMBER OF COMPONENTS ALL I'M HERE TO TESTIFY ON TECHNICAL ISSUES. BUT THERE ARE TWO ISSUES THAT ARE WANTED JUST KIND OF CRYSTALLIZED. IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT EVERY YEAR IN CALIFORNIA. A THIRD OF A HIGH SCHOOL IS KILLED EVERY YEAR IN CALIFORNIA BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE GDL COVERING THIS FULL AGE GROUP. A THIRD OF A HIGH SCHOOL DIES EVERY YEAR AND FAR MORE ARE HOSPITALIZED. THE OTHER THING THAT THIS BILL HAS ACCOMPLISHED IS NEGOTIATING OVER TIME TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL THE CHANGES THAT THIS BILL BRINGS ABOUT IS PAID. FOR THROUGH THE FEES THAT ARE ALREADY A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE DMV IN OUR LICENSE DRIVER EDUCATION SCHOOL SO THERE'S PLENTY OF MONEY TO PAY FOR THE PROGRAM. THIS IS NOT A NEW PROGRAM DMV DOES THIS IS BEEN COMING THEY WERE THE SIGNATORY ON THE STRATEGIC HIGHWAY SAFETY PLAN. THIS IS NOT GOING TO BE A BIG LIFT FOR THEM TO CHANGE THIS IT WILL TAKE SOME WORK BUT THIS IS NOT THE THING THAT'S GOING TO KEEP. THE DMV FROM BECOMING A SOUND AND NON CHALLENGED PLACE. THEY HAVE ENOUGH MONEY IN THIS BILL. AND IT'S A PROGRAM THAT IS BEEN ON THE LANDSCAPE FOR A LONG TIME THERE WILL BE SOME CHANGES BUT IT'S JUST AN AGE CHANGE THAT WE HAVE TO GO THROUGH. THE OTHER THING I WANT TO STRESS IS THAT A LOT OF MISCONCEPTIONS ABOUT WHEN A DRIVER HAS A PROVISIONAL LICENSE AND AS THE AUTHOR POINTED OUT WE HAVE SHORTENED THAT PROVISIONAL LICENSE FOR EIGHTEEN NINETEEN AND TWENTY YEAR OLDS TO SIX MONTHS. YOU CAN DRIVE TO WORK YOU CAN DRIVE TO SCHOOL YOU CAN ALL YOUR FAMILY MEMBERS AROUND YOU CAN DRIVE YOURSELF TO THE IF YOU'RE A FARM WORKER GOING TO A DAIRY FARM AT THREE IN THE MORNING. YOU CAN DO THAT THAT HAS NEVER BEEN BLOCKED BY THE GDL PROGRAM. IF YOU'RE GOING TO SCHOOL IN THE URBAN AREAS YOU CAN DO THAT WE JUST FOR THOSE SIX MONTHS UNTIL YOU'RE A VERY SAFE EXPERIENCED DRIVER WE DON'T WANT YOU DOING. THE THINGS THAT BECAUSE WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE FORENSICS OF THESE ACCIDENTS GETS DISTRACTED DRIVING IS THE BIGGEST CAUSE OF THE ACCIDENT THAT KILLED THESE KIDS. AND KILL THE YOUNG PEOPLE AND SO THOSE THINGS ARE RESTRICTED FOR SIX MONTHS BUT YOU CAN TRY TO WORK YOU CAN DO ALL THAT AND A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK THAT -- IF YOU HAVE THIS YOU CAN'T YOU CAN'T DO THAT. SO I'M GONNA JUST STOP WILL BE AVAILABLE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS IF YOU HAVE ANY IT'S NOT A NEW ISSUE IS THE AUTHOR POINTED OUT. MISTER CHAIRMAN WAS KATHY WEARING CAN NOT GIVEN THAT FAST -- MOTION AND SECOND ALL JUST BE AVAILABLE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU THAT'S VERY STUDIOUS. GET TO WORK WITH THE HEALTH OFFICER'S ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA HERE TO REGISTER OUR STRONG SUPPORT FOR THE BILL. THANK YOU WITHOUT. ANY OTHER MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC FEEL LIKE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THE AUTHORS BILL PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME AND WHO YOU REPRESENT CAN STONE STONE ADVOCACY ON BEHALF OF ALL STATE INSURANCE IN ENTHUSIASTIC SUPPORT. MATIC IN ON BEHALF OF THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA LIFE AND HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANIES WITH SUPPORT [inaudible] THANK YOU. KEVIN ANDERSON ON BEHALF OF NATIONWIDE IN SUPPORT. ANY OTHER MEMBERS THE PUBLIC SCHOOL WOULD LIKE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT THE AUTHORS BILL. SAYING NO TO ANY MEMBERS OF PUBLIC THAT WOULD LIKE TO TESTIFY OR SHARE CONCERNS. ABOUT THE AUTHORS BILL. SEEING NONE ANY QUESTIONS OF THE COMMITTEE OF THE AUTHOR. THIS FREEDOM. THANK YOU I HAVE A QUESTION FOR THE ADVOCATES AND I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S REALLY A A POINT OR QUESTION. BUT YOU WERE COMPARING -- FOR PEOPLE WHO GO THROUGH THE PROGRAM -- AND THEIR ACCIDENT RATES TO PEOPLE WHO DON'T GO TO THE PROGRAM AND THEIR ACCIDENT RATES. SO IF I'M CORRECT IN THE WAY THESE PRO THIS PROGRAM WORKS IS PEOPLE ARE BASICALLY OPTING IN -- BY GETTING THEIR LICENSE AT A CERTAIN AGE CORRECT SO YOU HAVE A GROUP THAT'S OPTING INTO THE PROGRAM AS OPPOSED TO A GROUP THAT'S NOT. CURRENTLY OUR PROGRAM ONLY GOES TO AGE. EIGHTEEN OF ABOUT 40% OF OUR OF OUR YOUNG FOLKS TODAY WAIT UNTIL AFTER AGE EIGHTEEN BUT THE RESEARCHERS SHOWN IT'S NOT BECAUSE OF THE GDL IS BECAUSE OF ECONOMICS. NO I I UNDERSTAND THAT BUT WHAT I'M SAYING THAT YOU'RE COMPARING THE ACCIDENT RATES. OF A GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE SELF SELECTED TO OPT INTO THIS PROGRAM AS A AS OPPOSED TO PEOPLE WHO WAIT AND THEN DON'T HAVE THE BENEFIT OF THE PROGRAM -- NO THE SIXTEEN SEVENTY ROLES OF THE GET THEIR LICENSE HAVE TO GO THROUGH G. DEAL RIGHT SO WHAT THAT GIVES US AND WHAT IT GIVES US A NOTE ALL THE OTHER FIFTY STATES AS WE CAN RESEARCH. WHERE THE FATALITIES HAPPEN SO EIGHTEEN NINETEEN OR TWENTY YEAR OLDS THAT CAN JUST WALK IN AND GET THEIR LICENSE UNLIKE OLDER TWENTY YEAR OLDS AND I CAN GO INTO THAT TOO IF YOU WANT? BUT THOSE FOLKS EIGHTEEN NINETEEN AND TWENTY YEAR OLDS -- THAT DO NOT HAVE THE BENEFIT OF GDL THEIR FATALITY CRASH RATE IS IT'S 55% HIGHER THAN THOSE SIXTEEN AND SEVENTEEN YEAR OLDS THAT GO THROUGH GDL AND THOSE ARE FATAL ACCIDENTS RIGHT NOW I UNDERSTAND I GUESS I'M JUST MAKING THE POINT THAT I THINK YOU'VE GOT A LOT OF STRONG CORRELATION. BUT THAT'S NOT EXACTLY THE SAME AS TAKING TO POPULATIONS THAT ARE THE SAME AND THEN HAVING ONE GO THROUGH THE PROGRAM AND ONE NOT THESE ARE THESE ARE DIFFERENT POPULATIONS ONE IS OLDER -- THERE'S A VARIETY OF REASONS SO I'M JUST I GUESS MY POINT IS JUST I WAS NINE I THINK THIS PROGRAM IS GREAT AND I'M SURE THERE IS. I DON'T THINK THAT THE CORAL IF YOU KNOW YOUR YOU ARE TALKING TO DIFFERENT POPULATIONS AND PEOPLE WHO ARE SELF SELECTING WHETHER IT'S TO GET THEIR LICENSE AT A CERTAIN AGE OR NOT -- SO I DON'T THINK THAT. THE BECAUSE I DON'T THE CORRELATION IS EXACTLY IS SORT OF SCIENTIFICALLY PROVEN AS YOU'RE MAKING IT OUT TO BE I'M NOT SAYING THAT THERE'S NOT SOME CORRELATION THERE BUT IT'S NOT THE SAME AS IF YOU TOOK ONE GROUP OF SIXTEEN YEAR OLDS. AND ONE GROUP THAT YOU KNOW AND AND ONE PORT ONE GROUP OF EIGHTEEN YEAR OLDS. THAT'S EXACTLY THE SAME AND RANDOMIZE THEM TO TWO DIFFERENT -- TWO DIFFERENT PROGRAMS IT'S A LITTLE IT'S A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT AND WHAT YEAR OLD MIGHT YOU KNOW DR. DIFFERENTLY THEY HAVE TWO MORE YEARS OF EXPERIENCE THEY MAY DRIVE DIFFERENTLY THAN EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD GETTING A LICENSE FOR THE FIRST TIME I'M JUST SAYING THAT IF YOU PUT EIGHTEEN ENROLLED IN THE SAME PROGRAM YOU MIGHT NOT GET THE EXACT SAME RESULT AS PUTTING SOMEBODY FIFTEEN INTO IT. THAT'S ALL I'M NOT I'M NOT ARGUING I'M JUST SAYING YOU'RE NOT EXACTLY THE SAME POPULATIONS THAT WE WE HAVE CRASH DATA FROM INDIANA IN NEW JERSEY THAT HAVE GONE TO TWENTY ONE SO WE KNOW WHAT THE EIGHTEEN NINETEEN TWENTY OR LOOK LIKE WHEN THEY WHEN THEY GO THROUGH ITS. BUT YOUR YOUR POINTS WILL TAKE. ASSEMBLY MEMBER MEDINA YEAH -- AS A LONG TIME -- HIGH SCHOOL TEACHER. THAT YEAR AFTER YEAR -- SAW. THE TRAGEDIES OF SOMETIMES -- YOUNG PEOPLE AGO GOT INVOLVED IN AN AND AND ALSO -- NUMEROUS DEATHS IN MY TWENTY YEARS OF TEACHING I SUPPORTED THIS BILL THE LAST TIME AND WHEN I THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING IT FORWARD AGAIN THIS YEAR AND I WILL SUPPORT IT AGAIN. ANY OTHER CUNNINGHAM. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD I THINK. WE'VE GOT A PROBLEM KIDS ARE WAITING LONGER TO GET THEIR DRIVER'S LICENSE THEY'RE THEY'RE ABLE TO ESSENTIALLY. EVADE THE INTENT IN A WAY OF WHAT THE GRADUATED LICENSE PROGRAM IN THE ADDITIONAL TRAINING IT PROVIDES TWO YOUNG DRIVERS. WAS SUPPOSED TO PROVIDE. I THINK THAT'S A FAIR POINT ABOUT THE DATA BUT I DO THINK THERE'S SOME DATA SUGGESTING AT LEAST THAT -- THEPUBLIC SAFETY AND OUR ROAD SAFETY WOULD BENEFIT FROM HAVING EIGHTEEN NINETEEN TWENTY YEAR OLDS GO THROUGH A RATHER TRUNCATED PROGRAM BUT STILL PROGRAM WHERE THEY GET SOME TRAINING. AND IN MY PROFESSIONAL LIFE AS AN ATTORNEY I'VE SEEN. A LOT OF PEOPLE DO A LOT OF DUMB THINGS IN CARS AND I'VE SEEN A LOT OF TRAGEDY COME FROM SO. I BELIEVE THAT THIS IS A WERE THE BILL AND I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT. TODAY AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MR DAILY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I JUST WANNA FOLLOW UP ON THE COMMENTS ALL OF WHICH I AGREE WITH IN. THE SALUTE THE AUTHOR FOR DOING A NICE JOB TO SUMMARIZE -- WHAT YOU'D LIKE TO DO HERE AND ALSO WERE IT CERTAINLY DOES? IT'S A GREAT FOLLOW UP ON THE WORK THAT ARE CHAIR HAS DONE ON THIS SUBJECT OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS SO THANK YOU AND NAMA. IN TWO ZERO SIX SUPPORTER OF THE BILL. THE QUESTION IS OF THE AUTHOR OF THE COMMITTEE. SO THREE THIS WAS LIKE CLOSE -- YOU KNOW I I CERTAINLY -- APPRECIATE AGAIN MISTER ALL OF THE WORK IN THE COMMENTS I THINK. THE COMMENT THAT MISS WE DO MADE IS A GOOD ONE YOU KNOW WE DON'T KNOW. YOU KNOW IF IF IT DOES BECOME LAW. YOU KNOW WEEK YOU KNOW WE DON'T ANTICIPATE THAT THE IMPACT IS GOING TO BE A GOOD. ONE BUT CERTAINLY THOSE FACTORS AS FAR AS YOU KNOW THE INFLUENCE THAT IN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN TWENTY ROLES GONNA HAVE IN THIS PROGRAM YOU KNOW THE KIND OF SUPPORT THEY GONNA GET FROM THE PARENTS WILL KIND OF YOU KNOW INVOLVEMENT IS THE IS. MUCH DIFFERENT THAN IF YOU HAVE SOMEONE WHO'S -- FIFTEEN SIXTEEN YOU KNOW OR MUCH YOUNGER -- BUT WE CAN ONLY I ANTICIPATE GOOD OUTCOMES FROM THIS BECAUSE CERTAINLY -- IT'S MUCH BETTER THAN WHAT WE HAVE -- AND NO YOU KNOW WE CAN I JUST PAY TO HAVE -- DEPOSIT OUT AND BUT WITH THAT RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AND I BOTH ON AND THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THE TIMES TO CHECK. AND THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU SUMMARY OF THIS -- AS MANY ON THE COMMITTEE ALREADY KNOW EXTENDING CALIFORNIA'S PROVISIONAL DRIVER'S LICENSE. PROGRAM UP TO TWENTY ONE YEARS OLD HAS BEEN A PRIORITY OF MINE. ACCORDING TO THE CDC AND THAT'S A DRIVERS TO GO THROUGH A PROVISIONAL LICENSING PERIOD EXPERIENCE. 4260% FEWER VEHICLE CRASHES THAN THOSE WHO WAIT UNTIL THEY'RE EIGHTEEN TO GET THEIR DRIVER'S LICENSE. CAR CULTURE IS NT WHAT IT USED TO BE. OVER 30% OF OUR DRIVERS ARE WAITING UNTIL THEY ARE EIGHTEEN OR OLDER TO GET A LICENSE. EXTENDING OUR PTO REQUIRES TOLD DRIVERS WILL ONLY MAKE SURE OUR ROADS ARE SAFER FOR EVERYBODY. AS A PARENT WHO LOST A CHILD. IN A CAR ACCIDENT. I IMPLORE YOU TO SUPPORT THIS BILL THANK YOU.

WE WILL NOW MOVE -- TO FILE ITEM. FOR A AB. SEVEN ZERO EIGHT I'M NOT SURE WHEN YOU CAN BEGIN WHEN YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS. AB SEVEN AWAIT CLOSES A LOOPHOLE. THAT ALLOWS ONLINE TRAFFIC VIOLATORS SCHOOLS TO CREATE HUNDREDS OF SIMILARLY NAMED SCHOOLS FOR THE PURPOSE OF DOMINATING. THE BILL CAN BE REFERRAL SECOND. WITH THAT. COOL AFTER CHRIS TO OUR WITNESSES BECAUSE THEY TRAVEL DISTANCES TO COME. MISTER CHAIRMAN MADAM CHAIRMAN MEMBERS -- SCOTT QUESTION BEHALF OF THE DISTANCE LEARNING COMPANY -- AS THE AUTHOR HAS POINTED OUT. THE GAME HAS BECOME IN THE TRAFFIC VIOLATORS SCHOOL REGISTERING AS MANY NAMES AS POSSIBLE ON THE LIST. BECAUSE YOU'RE OPPORTUNITY OF THROUGH RANDOM SELECTION OF GETTING SELECTED BY CONSUMERS IS IS A HIGHER WITH EACH ONE SO. TODAY CALIFORNIA HAS SLIGHTLY OVER TWENTY NINE HUNDRED TRAFFIC VIOLATORS SCHOOLS. FIVE COMPANIES OWN OVER TWO THOUSAND OF THOSE. ONE COMPANY ALONE HAS. FOURTEEN HUNDRED THEY REGISTERED A HUNDRED NEW SCHOOL NAMESTHIS MONTH FIVE HUNDRED IN JANUARY. THIS NOT ONLY HURTS LEGITIMATE BUSINESSES LIKE MY CLIENT. IT DECEIVED CONSUMERS. ANNA BURDENS THE DMV YOU HAS TO PROCESS IN YOUR WOOL. OF APPLICATION RENEWALS FOR EACH ONE OF THESE THREE ALMOST THREE THOUSAND SCHOOLS. AND IS RENDERED THE AUDIT PROCESS THE RANDOM AUDIT PROCESS VIRTUALLY MEANINGLESS BECAUSE THE SCHOOLS ARE OWNED. OF VIRTUALLY BY THE SAME IT'S A TEASE. BEFORE HEADED OVER TO OUR OTHER WITNESSES I'LL JUST POINT OUT TO YOU -- THIS IS WHAT THE THE COURTS HAND OUT TO FOLKS. PAGE AFTER PAGE AFTER PAGE. THE WRITING IS SO SMALL NOW BUT EVEN WITH MY GLASSES I CAN'T I CAN'T READ IT. ORANGE COUNTY ALONE IS IS PUBLISHING TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND COPIES OF THIS PER MONTH. AT A COST OF LIKE FIFTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH. IT IT'S GOTTEN OUT OF CONTROL IT'S HURTING CONSUMERS AND WE WOULD URGE AN AYE VOTE HAVE A COUPLE VERY QUICK WITNESSES FOR YOU THANK YOU. AT THE VERY MUCH PLEASE PROCEED WHEN READY. MADAM CHAIRMAN -- IN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR LET ME SPEAK TODAY -- I URGE YOUR EYES FOR THIS -- ON AB SEVEN AWAIT. I I I NOT SURE IF ANYBODY GOT THIS IF YOU GUYS ALL GOT THIS. I JUST PUT TOGETHER A QUICK LITTLE SUMMARY WHAT'S GOING ON HERE -- AB TWO FOUR NINE NINE HAD A COUPLE NEW POLLS LEFT IN IT THAT WE WERE GOING TO CLOSE UP EVENTUALLY IN THIS IS THE TIME TO DO IT. MAINLY THE LIST MANIPULATION IS THE BIGGEST PROBLEM. IF YOU LOOK ON THIS SHEET THAT ID THAT I GIVE YOU PROBABLY -- STARTING ON PAGE THREE TALK ABOUT EXAMPLES OF THE THINK SCHOOLS. YOU'LL SEE ON THERE. THERE'S FIVE THIS SCHOOL HAS FOURTEEN HUNDRED NAMES ON THE LIST AND THEY HAVE FOURTEEN HUNDRED IDENTICAL WEBSITES IF YOU LOOK AT PAGE ONE THROUGH FIVE THE ONLY THING THAT HAS CHANGED. IS NUMBER ONE AFTER THE NAME NUMBER TWO AFTER THE NAMES NUMBER THREE AFTER THE NAME ALL THE WAY THROUGH. THANK YOU WOULD HAVE TO FOURTEEN HUNDRED OF THOSE. FINALLY ITEM I WOULD HAPPEN TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE THE CUSTOMER REVIEWS ON EACH OF THE WEBSITES AND THEY'RE THE EXACT SAME. SO THESE ARE NOT INDEPENDENTLY RUNNING SCHOOLS THESE ARE FRONTS. THESE ARE SHAMS AND THERE ARE MISLEADING THE CONSUMER TO BELIEVE THAT THEY HAVE CHOICE. ANOTHER VERY IMPORTANT FACTOR BEFORE I GO. IS IT'S AGAIN. WHAT MISTER WHICH SAYS IT'S COSTLY TO THE TAXPAYERS THE OF FREE ADVERTISING? AND FREE MARKETING TO THE CAN UP FOR THE BUSINESSES AND THEY SHOULDN'T GET THIS FREE MARKETING -- WHEN IT'S REALLY JUST A FRONT? I THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT WASN'T NEXT WITNESS HI MS LARSON WHICH YOU ALONG WITH BUT ALL KINDS -- WE CAN IN THE TRAFFIC SAFETY INDUSTRY NOW 420- YEARS. AND JUST ROAD BRIEFLY -- WE WANT TO TALK WITH THE IMPACT AND CONSUMER HE CREATES CONFUSION -- FOR FOR THE CONSUMER AS A SIGN OF FOR ONE COURSE THAT HAS THE EXACT SAME NAME AS ANOTHER COURSE JUST WITH A DIFFERENT NUMBER AT THE END -- SO DURING THE COURSE OF THE SHOULD NEED ASSISTANCE. GETTING HOLD OF SOMEONE BASED ON AT THE EXACT SAME NAME GOING TO THAT LIST AGAIN IS VERY PROBLEMATIC A LOT OF TIMES ARE UNABLE TO GET THAT ASSISTANCE OR ONCE YOU'VE COMPLETED THE COURSE A YEAR LATER. IF THEY NEED A ANOTHER RECERTIFICATION OR THE TO DUPLICATE THE TICKET WE FINDING THAT SCHOOL AGAIN ON THAT LIST IS ALMOST NEXT TO IMPOSSIBLE. LAST NIGHT ALSO POINT OUT THAT. GIVEN THESE PROBLEMS THAT THE CONSUMER MIGHT FACE WITH ONE OF THESE SCHOOLS IF -- SEVERAL YEARS LATER THEY DECIDE THAT THEY HAVE TO TAKE ANOTHER RECIPROCATION COURSE IN A TRAFFIC SCHOOL COURSE TRYING TO AVOID THAT SAME BAD ACTORS ALMOST NEXT IMPOSSIBLE SINCE THEY HAVE SUCH MANIPULATION ON THE LIST. YOU HAD A BAD EXPENSES ONE UNIT TO VOTE IN THE FUTURE YOU'VE WRITTEN UP ALL RIGHT AT THE EXACT SAME SCHOOL AGAIN SEVERAL YEARS LATER. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. I THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES. PLEASE REPEAT MADAM CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU GERRY ALEXANDER. DIRECTIVE EDUCATION CONCEPTS WE'VE BEEN DOING BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA FOR OVER TWENTY FIVE YEARS AND A JUST SENTENCE ME TO SEE HOW AN INDUSTRY THAT CAN SAVE LIVES JUST GOT KID THAT BY A FEW MONEY GRABBING INDIVIDUALS -- BUT ONE OF THE AND I CALLED. THE TESTIMONY. THAT WE JUST HEARD. IS REALLY TRUE AND AND AND PRESIDENT BUT I ALSO WANT TO TESTIFY ANOTHER SUBJECT AND THAT'S CONSUMER SECURITY -- DMV RULES REGULATING TRAFFIC WITH A SCHOOL INDUSTRY BEEN WRITTEN MANY YEARS AGO BEFORE THE ADVENT OF THE ONLINE EDUCATION. CURRENTLY SCHOOLS COLLECT ONE OF THE MOST SENSITIVE DATA. OUT THERE WE COLLECT NAME HOME ADDRESS DRIVER'S LICENSE. OF EACH OF EACH STUDENT. THERE IS CURRENTLY ABSOLUTELY NO PROVISIONS WITH. WITH WITH WITHIN THE REGULATIONS THAT MANDATE THAT THAT SECURITY IS PROTECTED -- THE MATTER OF FACT YOU'LL FIND THE PICTURE IN YOUR PACKETS. THIS IS THE FRONT DOOR TO THE GLOBAL HEADQUARTERS OF THE COMPANY THAT THE PRESENTS FOURTEEN HUNDRED SCHOOLS IN CALIFORNIA. THAT'S THAT'S THE OFFICE OF FRIDAY MORNING [inaudible] SO. WE DEFINITELY SEE THIS AS A PART YOU ENERGY HAS TO CLEAN UP THE INDUSTRY AND A LEGITIMIZING. I IMPROVE SECURITY FOR CONSUMERS -- AND BY AND BY THE WAY NOT NOT NOT ONLY ITS EXPOSES THE DATA THAT WE COLLECT WHICH ARE MILLIONS OF STUDENT RECORDS -- ITS EXPORT THIS IDEA IN THE AYE IF YOU'RE A MEMBER FOR YEARS AGO WE HAD A CASE WITH WERE TARGET DATE WAS -- HAD. MILLIONS OF REC -- PRIVATE THAT GREAT GUARDS WERE EXPOSED. THAT HACKER FIND ITS WAY INTO TARGET. THROUGH A SMALL IF REGENERATION REPAIR COMPANY BECAUSE THEY DID NOT FOLLOW PROPER PROTOCOLS. EACH TRAFFIC SCHOOL CURRENTLY CONNECTS TO THE DMV TO REPORT STUDENT COMPLETIONS SO WE REALLY HAVE A DIRECT PIPELINE TO THE ENTIRE D. V. IF ONE OF THE SCHOOLS ATTACK. THANK YOU. I THINK VERY MUCH WOULD YOU LIKE TO PRODUCE THE SPEAK IN SUPPORT MEN [inaudible] BILL. BUT A VERY MUCH ARE THERE ANY OTHER INDIVIDUALS IN THE PUBLIC THAT LIKE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT. SEEING NONE ANY. ANYONE IN THE PUBLIC THAT LIKE TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION. PLEASE COME ON UP BUT HIM PROCEED WHEN YOU'RE READY. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN PAUL CURRY ON BEHALF OF TRAFFIC ONE ONE DOT COM. I'D LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT WE DID HAVE AN OPPOSITION LETTER DELIVERED TO THE COMMITTEE OF THE RIVER. ANALYSIS DOES NOT REFLECT THAT THE AMENDMENTS WE WERE NOT ABLE TO OBTAIN THE AMENDMENTS UNTIL THE TWENTY FIFTH WHEN THEY WERE RELEASED TO THE PUBLIC WE HAD ACTUALLY CONTACTED THE AUTHORS OFFICE TRYING TO GET THE COPIES OF THE AMENDMENTS. WE WERE EVEN INFORMED WHO THE SPONSORS OF THE LEGISLATION WAS UNTIL LATER IN THE DAY. BEFORE THE COMMITTEE HEARING SO WE DROPPED A LETTER OFTEN OPPOSITION ON THE TWENTY SIX BEFORE NOON I PERSONALLY DROPPED THAT LETTER BOTH THE AUTHOR AND THE COMMITTEE STAFF SO THAT WE COULD BE ON TOP. OF ON THE RECORDS SOMEONE TO MAKE THAT CLEAR TO THE COMMITTEE BECAUSE THIS IS BEEN A VERY DIFFICULT A BILL. FOR US TRYING TO WORK ON TRYING TO FIND WHO WE NEEDED TO TALK TO WE WE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO DO THAT WE'VE BEEN WILLING TO TRY TO WORK WITH PEOPLE -- THAT'S NOT BEEN POSSIBLE SO I HAVE A PMR CLIENT HERE WHO WILL EXPLAIN. OUR OPPOSITION THANK YOU. I THANK YOU VERY MUCH PLEASE ENTER NAME AND PRETTY WHEN YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU COMMITTEE MY NAME IS ARMAND JUST MILLION I'M THE OWNER OF TRAFFIC ONE ONE DOT COM I'VE BEEN IN THE INDUSTRY TWENTY PLUS YEARS OF ALONG WITH MR SOLD THIS WEEK. PIONEERED IN A SENSE THIS INDUSTRY -- VERY LONG TIME AGO -- I'M SPEAKING TO IN OPPOSITION OF AB SEVEN AWAITS. THERE'S NO ARGUMENT THAT A HANDFUL TRAFFIC SCHOOLS OWNERS HAVE GROSSLY ABUSED AND MANIPULATED TVS LIST I AM IN COMPLETE AGREEMENT THAT THE SCHOOLS ARE OF THE PLATING THIS LIST IN THE SENATE SUCH A WAY OF USING THE SAME DOMAIN NAMES AND SO FORTH -- HOWEVER IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THE COMMITTEE UNDERSTANDS BOTH -- SUPPORTERS HIDDEN AGENDA AND ALSO THE NEGATIVE IMPACT THIS BILL WILL HAVE. IN ITS CURRENT FORM THIS IS PURELY SELF INTEREST BILL THAT HAS VAGUE LANGUAGE DOES UNFAIR TO SMALLER TVS COMPANIES AND VERY COSTLY TO THE DMV. FIRST OF SUPPORTERS WANT YOU TO BELIEVE THAT THE CURRENT SYSTEM OF PRINTING ALL LICENSE SCHOOLS ON PBS LISTA SOMEWHAT HARMFUL TO THE PUBLIC. AND I SAY ALL SCHOOLS MEANING THERE ARE MANY SCHOOLS THAT DO HAVE MULTIPLE SCHOOLS LIKE I DO THAT DO IT IN NAME. OF NON ABUSIVE WAY AS THE MAIN OUR GROUP HAS DONE. THIS CAN'T BE FURTHER SORRY -- THEY WANT YOU TO BELIEVE THAT IT'S GOING TO HURT THE PUBLIC BUT THIS CAN'T BE TRUE FOR THE CAN BE FURTHER FROM THE TRUTH. IN FACT THE RISE OF NUMBER LICENSE SCHOOLS HAS INCREASED COMPETITION IN THE INDUSTRY AND RESULTING IN LOWERING THE COST OF TRAFFIC SCHOOL COURSES WHICH IS AN OBVIOUS BENEFIT TO THE PUBLIC. DOES SUPPORTERS SCHOOLS FOR EXAMPLE CHARGE. ON TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS FOR EACH COURSE WELL MY COMPANY FIVE DOLLAR TRAV SCHOOL DOT COM CHARGES FIVE DOLLARS FOR THE EXACT SAME SERVICE IN HISTORY CONDITIONS EVEN MORE OF A SERVICE. THEIR TRAFFIC VIOLATORS HAVE ALREADY PAID SEVERAL HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS IN FINES AND PENALTIES SAVE THEM MONEY ON THE COST OF YOUR TRIBE TRAFFIC SCHOOL SHOULD BE IMPORTANT TO THIS COMMITTEE. IT IS BECAUSE OF THIS INTENSE COMPETITION DOUBLE SOME SUPPORTERS FEEL THAT THE MOST PASSED HIS BILL IN ORDER TO RETURN THE GOOD OLD DAYS WHEN THEY DOMINATED THE INDUSTRY. IT'S A POINT TO NOTE ALSO THE SUPPORT OF THE BILL HAVE BEEN THIS INDUSTRY AS LONG AS I HAVE. AND AGAIN BEFORE THE INDUSTRY MODEL CHANGE STAYED TRULY DID DOMINATE THE INDUSTRY. SECOND THE VAGUE LANGUAGE OF THIS BILL WAS WILL NOT SOLVE ANY PROBLEMS BUT WILL ONLY BRING ON NEW PROBLEMS AND HARM SOME VERY ETHICAL TVS IS. SUCH AS MY OWN IT IS VAGUE LANGUAGE IN THIS CURRENT TVS REGULATIONS THAT MADE IT IS THE CURRENT TVS REGULATIONS THAT MADE IT EASY FOR ME IN OUR GROUP THOUSANDS OF SCHOOLS. USING A AN UNSCRUPULOUS BUSINESS PRACTICES. AS MR SOLD THIS MENTIONED MR MAN ARGUES THE EXACT SAME WEBSITE ADDRESS FOR HUNDREDS OF SCHOOLS WHICH IS A CLEAR PROBLEM HOWEVER ANOTHER NO NO WE'RE IN THEIR CURRENT LEGISLATION IS THERE PRO -- PROPOSED BUDGET LOCAL LEGISLATION IS A LANGUAGE TRYING TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM. IF THIS BILL PASSES CURRENT LAW ABIDING SCHOOL BE NECK. NEGATIVELY IMPACTED WHICH IS PART OF THE SUPPORTERS INTENDS TO WE CAN COMPETITION. THE TRUE CAUSE OF THE INDUSTRY THIS BILL AS AMENDED IS UNFAIR VAGUE AND WILL BE VERY COSTLY FOR THE DMV. CURRENTLY EACH LICENSE SCHOOL HAS A REQUIREMENT TO PAY YEARLY DMV LICENSE FEE A HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE DOLLARS UP TWO HUNDRED AND FIVE DOLLARS. THE MUST CARRY FIFTEEN THOUSAND ARE BOND AMONG OTHER FINANCIAL REQUIREMENTS BY MEETING THESE REQUIREMENTS CURRENT LEGISLATION GRANTS EACH LICENSE SCHOOL THE RIGHT TO AN INDIVIDUAL LISTING ON THE LIST. IF A GROUP OF SCHOOLS ONLY PURE ONCE ON THE LIST. AS THEY ARE PROPOSING IT IS ONLY LOGICAL THAT THEY SHOULD ONLY PAY ONE LICENSING FEE ONE BOND AT CETERA. HOWEVER THE PROPOSED BILL DOES NOT AMEND ANY OF THE CURRENT LEGISLATION LANGUAGE TO REFLECT THIS. THIS BILL ALSO FAILS TO EXPLAIN HOW THE SCHOOLS WE GROUP ON A LIST WILL ONLY ONE OF THE SCHOOL MAYES WE LISTED IF THERE IS ONLY ONE LISTING PER GROUP HOW WILL THE PUBLIC BE ABLE TO VERIFY THE LICENSE NUMBERS OF EACH SCHOOL IN THE GROUP. IS IT FAIR THAT THE COURTS AND PUBLIC ARE LEFT STRUGGLING TO MAKE SENSE OF IT ALL. BUT THE MOST DANGEROUS ASPECT OF ALL IS THE WAY THE BILL DEFINES AFFILIATED TRAFFIC SO THEY'LL MAY LATER SCHOOLS OR THE WAY THEY TRY TO GROUP THE SCHOOLS LEAVING THE WIDE OPEN FOR MISINTERPRETATION AND ABUSE. LET ME EXPLAIN THE BILL SITES FOUR CRITERIA IN A SCHOOL WE NEED TO MEET ONE OF THE CRITERIA TO BE CONSIDERED PART AN AFFILIATED GROUP WITH ANOTHER SCHOOL. EVEN IF THEY ARE NOT AFFILIATED AT ALL UNDER THIS BILL TWO SEPARATE SCHOOLS COULD HAVE THEIR LICENSES REVOKED FOR ONE YEAR. ON A FIRST OFFENSE AND FIVE YEARS FOR SECOND OFFENSE IF THEY FEEL TO REPORTER AFFILIATION. BASED ON THIS DEFINITION TO SCHOOLS CANNOT BE. ONE BASED ON THE CRITERIA FOR AFFILIATION IS TO SCHOOLS CANNOT BE IN THE SAME BUILDING. IF FOR EXAMPLE OF TRAFFIC SCHOOL ABC IS ALREADY IN GREAT BUILDING WITH LOW RENT I CAN'T HAVE MY OFFICE IN THE SAME BUILDING OR I WILL CAN BE CONSIDERED AS A GROUP OF LICENSE I'M SO I WILL BEGROUP ALONG WITH THAT EVEN THOUGH. I MAY NOT EVEN KNOW THE COMPANY. AND BOTH OF OUR LICENSES WILL BE REVOKED. TWO TVS IS COULD NOT SHARE THE SAME COMPUTER NETWORK OR SERVER WHICH MEANS THAT IF TO SCHOOLS ARE USING THE SAME HOSTING SERVICES SUCH AS GO GOOGLE GO THAT OUR AMAZON WEB SERVICES. YOUR CONSIDER GROUP. THE SHARING OF TELEPHONE SERVICES MANY LET A LEGITIMATE SMALLER SCHOOLS GOING TO UTILIZE THE SAME ANSWERING SERVICE WHICH SPECIALIZES IN THIS INDUSTRY THIS WOULD AND THAT'S REALLY FOR SMALLER TVS IS TO OCCUR HARD COSTS. BECAUSE IT SAYS THEY CAN NO LONGER USE THIS TYPE OF SERVICE. AND WHAT ABOUT THE VERY REAL POSSIBILITY THAT ONCE SIR I THINK -- WE WOULD TRY TO KEEP TIME LIMIT I UNDERSTAND BOTH SIDES -- ONE MORE MINUTE I REALLY AM FOUR POINT I'M SORRY I APPRECIATE I APOLOGIZE. UP AND THERE'S ALSO A HUGE POSSIBILITY OF SABOTAGE THE WAY THE LANGUAGE IS WRITTEN ANOTHER SCHOOL CAN SIMPLY LEASED SPACE IN THE SAME BUILDING HIGHER THE SAME TELEPHONE CALL CENTER OR EVEN TO USE THE SAME WEBSITE HOSTING COMPANY. AND THAT'LL AUTOMATICALLY. GROUP THEM AND IT LONG AND THEY WOULD HAVE NOT MENTIONED UP TO THE DMV AND THEY'LL LOSE THEIR LICENSE FOR A YEAR FOR LEASE FOR THE FIRST OFFENSE -- THE LEGAL ADMINISTRATIVE -- BOTH PARTS OF THIS IS A NIGHTMARE FOR THE DMV. I DO HAVE A COUPLE THINGS TO SAY BUT I THINK I PRETTY MUCH COVERED IT I DO APPRECIATE THE COMMITTEE'S TIME. I THANK YOU VERY MUCH. BEFORE WE GET TO COMMITTEE QUESTIONS ANY ADDITIONAL SPEAKERS IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE. I SAW SOMEONE GET UPSET IT AS SEEN ON ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. IT'S GOING IN. YEAH THIS IS MORE OF A QUESTION. FOR THE OPPOSITION. YEAH I HAVE I'M LOOKING AT THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS AND IT SAYS TEXAS HAS FIFTY SEVEN OF THESE SCHOOLS FLORIDA THIRTY THREE FIFTEEN IN NEW YORK. SURE THE LARGEST POPULATION STATES RELATIVES CALIFORNIA. UP WE'VE TWENTY NINE HUNDRED I I I GUESS I JUST WANT. I GET THAT YOU DON'T THINK THE BILL'S PERFECT IN THEIR ASPECTS OF THE PARTICULARS YOU DON'T LIKE BUT ON A GENERAL LEVEL LIKE WHO BENEFITS FROM HAVING. LIKE WOOD MISTER WHAT SHOWED US THESE PAGES THE COURTS HAND OUT WITH THOUSANDS OF THESE THINGS ON THIS ESSENTIALLY JUST. A RANDOM. DARK THROWS TO WHO GETS THE BUSINESS AT A HOUSE THAT BENEFITING THE CONSUMERS OR THE OR THE SYSTEM OR HELPING PEOPLE CLEAR UP TICKETS I DON'T I JUST DON'T GET IT [inaudible] WELL. THANK YOU. WELL AS FAR AS FEW OF THE OTHER STATES TEXAS FOR EXAMPLE HAS A SEVENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLAR APPLICATION FEE. SO IT MAKES IT VERY HARD TO GET ON THERE MORE THAN ONCE. THAT'S ONE OF THE MAIN. ENTRY THAT TEXAS DOES HAVE A NEW YORK HAS FOURTEEN OR FIFTEEN SCHOOLS NEW YORK HAS BEEN IN A PILOT PROGRAM FOR ALMOST TEN YEARS NOW -- THE STATE HOUSE COMPLETELY SHUT IT DOWN IF I WANTED TO START A COUPLE -- TRAFFIC'S WOUND AT NEW YORK I CANNOT BECAUSE BUT LEGISLATION WILL NOT ALLOW ME INTO THE PILOT PROGRAM IS FINISHED. I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH YOU TWENTY EIGHT HUNDRED SCHOOLS ON THE LIST AND YOU KNOW TWO THOUSAND AND BEING FOR ONE SCHOOL IS RIDICULOUS ESPECIALLY THE WAY THEY'RE DOING IT. THERE IS AN OLD MAIN BENEFIT TO IT BUT MY ARGUMENT ISN'T NECESSARILY TO ALLOW TO HAVE TWO THOUSAND SCHOOLS MY ARGUMENT IS THE WAY THE LANGUAGE IS CURRENTLY WRITTEN. IT IS JUST A RECIPE FOR DISASTER L. AS I EXPLAINED. IT WILL. THE BILL IT FOR ONE SCHOOL TO SABOTAGE ANOTHER AND ABILITY AYE I COULD GO AND RENT AN OFFICE BASEMENT BUILDING AND HAVE NO IDEA MY COMPETITORS IN THERE BECAUSE I DON'T. I'M NOT CHECKING OBVIOUSLY AND I COULD LOSE MY LICENSE BECAUSE I DIDN'T KNOW I MEAN SOMETHING JUST ISN'T RIGHT ABOUT THAT. NOT TO MENTION THE COST THIS IS GOING TO BRING ON THE DMV THERE'S A SIMPLE SOLUTION FOR THIS -- AND I'M OFFER TO SPEAK WITH OUR SO WITH THESE SUPPORTERS TO GIVE MY SUGGESTIONS ON THIS ONE SIMPLE SOLUTION ONE OF MANY IS TO REQUIRE REGULATION THAT EACH SCHOOL HAS A UNIQUE U. R. L.. SIMPLE MR MAIN ART WOULD HAVE TO HAVE FIFTEEN HUNDRED DOMAINS FIFTEEN HUNDRED WEBSITE AND SO ON AND SO ON MR MEAN ARE ALSO HAS ONE U. R. L. AND THE ALMOST PROBABLY FILTER TO THE SCENE. DATABASE THERE SHOULD BE A REQUIREMENT THAT EACH SCHOOL NEXT HAVE SEPARATE ACCESS DATABASE LÃ  DIFFERENT PASSWORDS USER BASIC Y. OF IDEAS ARE NOT IN LEGISLATION RIGHT NOW THAT COULD BE. I APPRECIATE THAT WITH THE CHAIRS INDULGENCE COULD I GIVE NATIONAL H.. TO UNITY TO RESPOND TO THAT THANK YOU SIMILAR CUNNINGHAM FIRST OF ALL -- THE OPPOSITION HERE BY THE WAY IF YOU LOOK AT YOUR LIST FIVE DOLLAR TRAFFIC SCHOOL HE'S GOT APPROX THREE HUNDRED FIFTY SCHOOLS. HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE OF THEM START OFF FIVE EIGHT IDENTICAL FIVE DOLLAR TRAFFIC SCHOOL AND THEN YOU ADD LIKE ONE TWO THREE OR TWO FOUR SEVEN AT THE END OF IT HOW THAT SERVES THE PUBLIC'S INTEREST. I DON'T KNOW BUT THE INTENT OF THIS BILL WAS TO CLEARLY GET OUT WILL CONTINUE TO TIGHTEN LANGUAGE I'M SURE DOING THAT THE THE CHAIR IS A STICKLER -- TO ENSURE THAT WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS IS PROGRAMS ARE CLEARLY AFFILIATED THEY HAVE A CAUGHT THEY SHARE REVENUE. THEY SHARE A MAILING ADDRESS AS WELL AS THE PHYSICAL ADDRESS SO IT'S NOT JUST THAT YOU'RE IN THE SAME BUILDING WE ACTUALLY HAVE THE SAME MAILING ADDRESS BUT BUT WE WE HAVE IS WE HAVE THE STRIP. OF OF MALLS WHERE YOU HAVE SOMEBODY THAT UNMARKED AD WITH A ONE ADDRESS WITH. FIFTY SERVERS -- AND THE BILL WILL GET PO BOXES FOR EACH AND EVERYONE OF THEM TAKE TO GET AROUND THIS WE THINK THE LANGUAGE IS PRETTY TIGHT. WE DEFINE FOR DIFFERENT WAYS WHAT AN AFFILIATED SCHOOLS ARE I THINK ANY COMMON. SENSE PURSUE LOOK AT AND SEE WHAT WHAT WE'RE GETTING AT AND AND HOW WOULD WORK WILL CONTINUE TO TIGHTEN THAT. BUT THAT'S THE ANSWER IS -- MISTER CUNNINGHAM THANK YOU. AT THE VERY MUCH MUCH JIM ADDED TO KNOW IF YOU WANT TO ADD ANYTHING. DRESSED IN THE CLOTHES WILL DO. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS IN THE COMMITTEE [inaudible] SEEING NONE. AND THE SHOW JUST CLOSE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN YOU KNOW. AS A FORMER SMALL BUSINESS OWNER WHEN I WAS APPROACHED WITH THIS LIST. I WAS ABSOLUTELY APPALLED. THERE ARE CONSUMERS IN THE DMV WAS BEING GAMES LIKE THIS. AND FINDING A LOOPHOLE TO BE ABLE TO TO CREATE THIS OPPORTUNITY I THOUGHT WAS APPALLING. THAT'S WHY WE MOVED THE BILL FORWARD WE KNOW THAT THERE'S THERE'S POSSIBLY ISSUES GOT POSITION MIGHT HAVE BROUGHT UP SOME GOOD POINTS THAT WE NEED TO ADDRESS GOING FORWARD. THAT'S WHAT THIS PROCESS IS ABOUT MOVING FORWARD AND ADJUSTING AS WE SEE THINGS IT WILL AUGMENT OR MAKE THE BILL BETTER. WITH THAT I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE.
