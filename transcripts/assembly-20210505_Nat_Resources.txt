AS THE EVOLVING CLIMATE CRISIS THREATENS THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF CALIFORNIANS IN OUR ENVIRONMENT EVERY DAY. HOWEVER WE ARE IN AN ESPECIALLY UNIQUE CIRCUMSTANCE AS WE ARE ALSO FACING A GLOBAL HEALTH CRISIS THAT IS BECAUSE OUR STATE'S UNEMPLOYMENT RATE TO LINGER AT DOUBLE THE RATE OF MARCH OF TWENTY TWENTY. RIGHT BEFORE SHELTER IN PLACE ORDERS WERE ISSUED. TO COMBAT BOTH OF THESE DILEMMAS CALIFORNIA NEEDS A CREATIVE SOLUTION AB FIFTEEN HUNDRED WILL REBUILD OUR WORK FORCE IN PROTECT OUR STATE AGAINST FUTURE CLIMATE RELATED DISASTERS. THAT UNLIKE COVERT NINETEEN WE KNOW ARE COMING SPECIFICALLY THIS BILL WILL PLACE A SEVEN BILLION DOLLAR BOND ON THE JUNE TWENTY TWENTY TWO BALLOT TO FINANCE VARIOUS CLIMATE ADAPTATION ACTIVITIES. WHICH CREATE LONG TERM GREEN JOBS THAT HELP US REACH OUR CLIMATE GOALS AND FRANKLY IT'S A MODEST DOWN PAYMENT GIVEN THE SCALE OF THE CHALLENGE THAT WE ARE FACING AS A STATE. AS THE NEED FOR EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS EFFORTS RISE IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT WE INVEST IN THE INFRASTRUCTURE NECESSARY TO PROTECT OUR COMMUNITIES. ENVIRONMENT AND ECONOMY FROM CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS AND MADAM CHAIR I'VE- I THINK I'VE BEEN MOTIVATED BY THE MAGNITUDE OF THE CHALLENGE THAT WE ARE FACING WE CAN'T AFFORD TO SIT BACK JUST IN MY REGION ALONG THE BAY AREA OVER A HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS- IS AT RISK. AND TWENTY FOUR BILLION DOLLARS AT RISK JUST IN MY COUNTY SO SEVEN BILLION REPRESENTS A MODEST APPROACH WE ARE GOING TO BE HEARING IN JUST A BIT FROM ADRIAN COVERT- WITH THE BAY AREA COUNCIL AS WELL AS RICO MASTRODONATO WITH THE TRUST FOR PUBLIC LAND ON THE LINE- BUT- BEFORE WE DO THAT LET ME TURN IT OVER TO. OUR JOINT AUTHOR AND REALLY THE LEAD ON THIS EFFORT OF COLLEAGUE ASSEMBLY MEMBER GARCIA. THANK YOU- COLLEAGUE INTO MEDICARE. MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE- I DON'T THINK I NEED TO ELABORATE MORE ON THE REASONS WHY THE BOND IS NECESSARY I'LL JUST SAY THAT- THERE IS A SENSE OF URGENCY ON ALL OF OUR PARTS UP AND DOWN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- MORE SO. WHEN WE LOOK AT PARTICULAR AREAS WHERE NOW THE GOVERNOR HAS DECLARED A DROUGHT. AND THE SIGNIFICANT IMPACT THAT THAT WILL HAVE STATEWIDE- I'D LIKE TO JUST POINT TO. ONE OF THE TOP REASONS WHY THIS BOND HAS COME FORWARD. AB LAST YEAR CALIFORNIA'S WORSE FIRE SEASON ON RECORD WITH OVER FOUR POINT. TWO MILLION ACRES BURNED. SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF LOSS WHEN IT COMES TO LIFE. AND PROPERTY. IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE HAVE TO DO BETTER WE HAVE TO DO MORE. IN NOW IS THE TIME. AS WAS MENTIONED BY MY COLLEAGUE IN A CO EQUAL PARTNER HERE. HI THIS IS A DOWN PAYMENT. AND WE HAVE A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY ALSO WITH THE BUDGET SURPLUS THAT IS BEFORE US. TO MAKE SOME ADVANCEMENTS. IN THE AREAS THAT WE HAVE OUTLINED AS PRIORITY IN THIS BOND SO. I DON'T KNOW THAT THE QUESTION WOULD BE EITHER OR- BUT I THINK GIVEN THAT WE RECOGNIZE THAT THIS IS A DOWN PAYMENT HAS BEEN MENTIONED. ARE THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO MORE- WITH THAT- RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR RIVAL. THANK YOU- BEFORE WE MOVE ON TO THE WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. OF WE HAVE A QUORUM AND I'D LIKE TO.

I WOULD THINK. FOR THIRTY YEARS AND EVERYTHING SCIENCE WARNED US ABOUT THIS COMING TRUE. WORST WILDFIRES EVER LAST YEAR ALL OF OUR READ THE BOARDS ARE AT 50% AND ARTWORK FACING ANOTHER CATASTROPHIC DROUGHT TWENTY TWENTY WHAT THE HOTTEST YEAR ON RECORD AND AUGUST THROUGH- OCTOBER IN CALIFORNIA. WHAT THE HOTTEST IN CALIFORNIA HISTORY- THE BOND ADDRESSES WILDFIRES BOTH THE NOTES AND DRINKING WATER WILDLIFE HABITS THAT. ARE FARMERS AND ANNA AND AGRICULTURE. REGIONAL CLIMATE RESISTANCE BUT I'M GOING TO FOCUS ON SOMETHING MADAM CHAIR I KNOW YOU CARE ABOUT WHICH IS EXTREME HEAT. THE STATE HAVE NO COMPREHENSIVE STRATEGY FOR WORK PROGRAM THAT ADDRESSES THE CLIMATE RELATED IMPACTS OF EXTREME HEAT. AND HELP ONLY TO NATURE BASED PROGRAMS THAT. EVEN A DRAFT THAT YOU ARE URBAN GREENING AND URBAN FORESTRY- BOTH HAVE BEEN GROSSLY UNDER FUNDED- AND URBAN GREENING DIDN'T GET ANY MONEY AND THE BUDGET IN JANUARY- THEY ARE REPRESENTED IN THIS BOND ALONG WITH THE AB THIRTY ONE PROGRAM- AND THAT'S AGAIN IT'S DESPITE THE REALITY OF WHAT WE EXPERIENCED LAST YEAR AND WHAT SCIENCE IS TELLING US- HE PUTS MORE PEOPLE IN THE HOSPITAL. AND KILLED SOME FRANKLY THAN ANY OTHER WELL WEATHER RELATED- BENT. AND JUST TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA- THERE WERE SURFACE TEMPERATURES RIGHT THERE AND- THE- THE EAST END OF THE COUNTY WHERE YOUR- DISTRICT AND- CHAIR REBATES. THAT WERE SURFACE TEMPERATURES THAT ARE HUNDRED AND FIFTY DEGREES PEOPLE CAN'T SURVIVE IN THE WORLD THAT- IF COMIC. ESPECIALLY IF THERE ARE NO GREEN SPACES NO TREE CANOPY. AND WE HAVE DENSELY POPULATED URBAN AREAS WHERE HEAT ISLANDS ARE FOCUSED LIKE YOU. HAVE A MAGNIFYING GLASS ON. SO I STRONGLY AND YOU THIS. AT THE GET THE MAN WE BACK URKE THING ON TO- IS. A LAW GERMAN FOR GREENING. BUT THIS FONG I DO WE'VE ALL OF THE PRIORITY I THANK THOSE PRIOR SHOULD BE. ALSO REPRESENTED IN THE BUDGET- THIS YEAR BECAUSE OF THE MAGNITUDE OF THE URGENCY- BUT THIS IS OUR- A GREAT PIECE OF LEGISLATION THOUGHTFULLY PUT TOGETHER BY BOTH AUTHORS BUT I WANT TO THANK THEM- Ã‹ OF THE TRUST FOR PUBLIC LAND AND- AND ALL OF CALIFORNIA FRANKLY FOR THE STOP- AB FIFTEEN HUNDRED. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- AND WITH THAT AYE RICHER AYE VOTE. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS. GOOD MORNING THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND ASSEMBLY MEMBERS MALIK GARCIA HI NEED HEARING COVERAGE WITH THE BAY AREA COUNCIL ON BEHALF OF THE LARGEST EMPLOYERS IN THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA THEIR EXAMPLES PLEASED TO SUPPORT AB FIFTEEN HUNDRED WITHIN THE PAST SEVEN YEARS CALIFORNIA'S ALREADY VOLATILE CLIMATE HAS SHATTERED LONGSTANDING CLIMATE RECORDS RELATED TO DROUGHT WILDFIRE HEAT AND FLOODS. THESE DISASTERS DAMAGE ECOSYSTEMS DAY HURT ECONOMIES AND THEY DISRUPT AND TOO OFTEN COST HUMAN LIVES THE TWENTY TWELVE THROUGH TWENTY SIXTEEN DROUGHT OUR MOST RECENT DROUGHT BEFORE THE ONE WE'RE CURRENTLY AND COST THREE POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS IN ECONOMIC LOSSES AND NEARLY THIRTY THOUSAND JOBS THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN WILD FIRES ALONE COST NEARLY A HUNDRED FIFTY BILLION DOLLARS IN ECONOMIC LOSSES AND ALL OVER A HUNDRED DEATHS. AND IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN A RECORD OF UP TO TWELVE YEAR COST NEARLY A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN FLOOD DAMAGES IN SAN JOSE ALLOWED TO NEARLY TOPPLED THE OROVILLE DAM SPILLWAY AND AS THE PREVIOUS SPEAKER MENTIONED AUGUST TWENTY TWENTY WAS THE HOTTEST MONTH IN STATE HISTORY EXTREME HEAT IS CAUSING INCREASED- PUBLIC SAFETY POWERSHOT ALTHOUGH THEN SCROLLING BLACKOUTS AND AROUND FORTY THAT'S ON AVERAGE EACH YEAR. AB FIFTEEN HUNDRED WOULD INVEST SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS IN UPGRADING AND IMPROVING THE RESILIENCE OF CALIFORNIA'S NEIGHBORHOODS BUSINESSES INFRASTRUCTURE AND ECOSYSTEMS D. EASE- AND PREPARE AND DEFEND AGAINST THESE AND OTHER CLIMATE RELATED CHALLENGES AND IN DOING SO AB FIFTEEN HUNDRED WOULD NOT ONLY HELP SAVE LIVES AND AVOID COSTLY DAMAGES FROM CLIMATE RELATED DISASTERS IT WOULD ALSO HELP CREATE JOBS STIMULATE GROWTH IMPROVING ECOSYSTEM HEALTH AND PROTECT COMMUNITIES. ACCORDING TO ANALYSIS CONDUCTED BY THE BAY AREA COUNCIL ECONOMIC INSTITUTE AB FIFTEEN HUNDRED WOULD SUPPORT THE CREATION. OF APPROXIMATELY A ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND JOHN. AND THEIR POINT FOUR BILL DOLLAR IN I CAN ACT OF CALIFORNIA ACROSS THE BOARD LYFT. PUTTING PEOPLE TO WORK TO STRENGTHEN THEIR NATURAL ENVIRONMENT IS AN AMERICAN TRADITION GOING BACK TO THE NEW DEAL AND THE MOST RECENT POLLING SHOWS A STRONG MAJORITY CALIFORNIANS WOULD SUPPORT A CLIMATE RESILIENCE BOND. TIED TO JOB GROWTH THAT THIS ONE IS THANK YOU FOR MY COMMENTS- PREDICT MY COMMENTS AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I. ABOUT. THANK YOU- NEXT WILL MOVE TO WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION WE HAVE ONE- ROBERT REID.

THANK YOU THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS- THANK YOU FOR THE INTRODUCTION SELLING MEMBER RIVAS- THIS CALIFORNIA'S CENTRAL VALLEY FLOOD CONTROL ASSOCIATION AS AN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION ON AB FIFTEEN HUNDRED- MAKE NO MISTAKE THERE'S A LOT OF GOOD PROVISIONS IN THIS BILL A LOT OF IMPORTANT FUNDING FOR MANY IMPORTANT PROGRAMS AND YOU'VE HEARD FROM THAT SUPPORT WITNESSES ABOUT HEAT AND DROUGHT. AND IN IN CLIMATE CHANGE BUT THIS BILL IS SORELY LACKING IN FUNDING THAT WE NEED FOR THE OPPOSITE OF THOSE AND THAT'S FROM THE WINTER TIME WHEN WE WILL ALL SEE IT INCREASINGLY- OCCURRENCES OF ATMOSPHERIC RIVERS THAT REALLY BLAST IN THE CALIFORNIA.

AND SO WE'RE GONNA HAVE INCREASING PRESSURE ON THE STATE PLAN A FLOOD CONTROL IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY% WHICH HAS SIXTEEN HUNDRED MILES OF LEVEES BYPASSES AND WEIRS THAT ARE IN MANY CASES- NOT ADEQUATE TO PROTECT THE LIVES AND PROPERTY WE'VE GOT ABOUT OVER ONE MILLION PEOPLE AND NEARLY ONE HUNDRED. BILLION DOLLARS IN DAMAGE WILL PROPERTY INCLUDING THE AREA AROUND THIS BUILDING THAT ARE SUSCEPTIBLE TO FLOODS. THIS WOULD BE THE THIRD BOND MEASURE IN A ROW- PROP ONE PROP SIXTY EIGHT IN THIS BILL THAT DON'T PUT SIGNIFICANT FUNDING INTO OUR FACILITIES FOR STATE PLAN FLOOD CONTROL. THE BILL THE BILL ONLY HOUSE- THE LAST SIGNIFICANT MONEY CAME FROM PROPOSITION ONE IN TWO THOUSAND SIX FIFTEEN YEARS AGO. WE STILL HAVE LEVEES IN OUR SYSTEM THAT WERE DAMAGED IN THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN WINTER THAT HAVE NOT BEEN REPAIRED. THEY'RE CURRENTLY ORPHAN SITES THAT FEMA DIDN'T DECIDE TO TAKE UP- THE REPAIRS FOR IN THE DEPARTMENT WATER RESOURCES HAVEN'T HASN'T HAD SUFFICIENT FUNDING TO DEAL WITH THOSE. THIS BILL DOESN'T CLUED ANY FUNDING FOR PROJECTS- THAT ARE IN AB SEVEN EIGHTY ONE BY SOME MEMBER DALY IN ORANGE COUNTY AB NINE TWENTY ONE BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER MCCARTY FOR WEST SACRAMENTO SB FOUR NINETY SIX FOR CENTER LATER IN THE PAHAR RIVER- WHICH HAS A- PROPOSED FLOOD PROJECT.

THANK YOU- ANY WITNESSES AT THE REMOTE TESTIMONY LOCATION SEEN NONE OF ANY QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. MISTER MATHIS. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- I THERE'S A LOT OF QUESTIONS WHEN WE START TALKING ABOUT BONDS WHEN THE BEING CAUGHT CLIMATE CHANGE AND CALL IT A YET ANOTHER WATER BOND- I THINK SOMETHING THAT REALLY STRUCK ME WAS THE FACT THAT. THE ONE OF THE PEOPLE THAT SPOKE IN FAVOUR MENTION THE FACT THIS IS ALREADY BEEN PULLED SO THIS MAKES US MORE OF A POLITICAL MOVE ALMOST ANYTHING- BUT I'M CURIOUS TO MY COLLEAGUES THAT ARE BRINGING THIS FORWARD. IN TWENTY FOURTEEN WITH. PROPOSITION ONE THIS POST REVISED SEVEN POINT FIVE BILLION. MEMBERS WE'VE BEEN HERE WE WE'VE TRIED TO WORKING OVERSEE THIS WE WERE A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE PROMISED- SOME NEW DAM SOME OTHER WATER PROJECTS NEW JOBS. A LOT OF THE SAME TALKING POINTS WE'RE HEARING TODAY. WHERE IS THAT MONEY GONE WAY OF THOSE JOBS GALLON IN WHAT IS HAPPENING WITH THIS. BECAUSE WE CONTINUE TO HEAR FOR IN IN A COLLEAGUES BY MEMBERS PRESENT AS I LOVE YOU GUYS I LOVE WORKING WITH YOU BUT THE SERIOUSLY. WHAT ARE WE DONE. SINCE SINCE WE GOT IN OFFICE NOW AND WHERE IS THIS GUY BECAUSE WE SAW THIS AGAIN AND IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN. WE SAW THE PUSH FOR PROPOSITION THREE. EIGHT POINT NINE BILLION. HERE TODAY WE'RE WE'RE ONLY ASKING FOR SEVEN BILLION IN IN WHAT I DON'T THINK THIS IS A MATTER OF A PRICE TAG. BECAUSE MY AND MY DEEPEST CONCERN IS THE FACT THAT ONE LAST YEAR WHEN WE STARTED SHUTTING DOWN OUR STATE BECAUSE OF THE COVERT NINETEEN PANDEMIC. WE WERE TOLD WE WERE GOING TO BE IN A RECESSION. WE DID MASSIVE CUTBACKS WE DID ALL OF THESE THINGS AND YET. TODAY AS WE PREPARE TO HEAR THE GOVERNOR'S MAY REVISE IT COMES UP. WE KNOW THERE'S A PROJECTED TWENTY BILLION DOLLAR SURPLUS. B. FOREST SERVICE SO WHY SHOULD WE GO BACK TO THE VOTERS. AND ASK OF THEM. FOR ANOTHER BOND WHEN WE JUST TOOK A SURPLUS OF THEIR MONEY. IN IN WHAT ARE WE DOING WITH THIS BECAUSE UNTIL WE FIX YOU CALL RED TAPE YOU CAN CALL GREEN TEA RIGHT INTEL YOU FIX THE PROCESS. WITH HOW THESE MONIES ARE ACTUALLY CREATING THE DELIVERABLES THE RETURN ON INVESTMENT THESE JOBS WE CLAIM THEY'RE GOING TO CREATE. WHY SHOULD WHY SHOULD ANY OF US SUPPORT THIS. BECAUSE I BE ON THE LOOK WE CAN LIST THE JOBS THAT'S GREAT WE NEED TO DO THINGS FOR CLIMATE CHANGE WE KNOW THAT WE WORK TOGETHER ON THAT. WE TALK ABOUT NEW RIDER PROJECTS WE TALK IF WE PASSED LEGISLATION WE PUSH THESE THINGS DAY IN AND DAY OUT WE LOSE SLEEP OVER THE. BUT WHERE IS THE RETURN ON INVESTMENT THAT WE KEEP TELLING THE PUBLIC WE'RE GOING TO DELIVER ON. WE CAN TALK CREAM JOBS ALL DAY LONG. NATIONALS AT IT. WHERE'S THE DELIVERABLES. SO THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION I THINK YOU KNOW THE ANSWER TO YOUR OWN QUESTION AND I THINK IT'S A FAIR QUESTION FOR THE GENERAL PUBLIC TO- HERE AT THIS DIALECT ONE MILLION REMAINS- AVAILABLE FROM PROP NE FOR THE PROJECTS THAT YOU MENTION I-THINK YOU ALSO RECOGNIZE THE CHALLENGES OF MAKING THOSE INVESTMENTS UP AND DOWN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT CONTINUE TO EXIST- WHETHER THEY BE ENVIRONMENTAL AND OR OTHER RELATED MATTERS RIGHT AND SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE TO. COLLECTIVELY WORK ON BUT- I THINK THAT THIS SPECIFIC BOND- THAT IS BEFORE YOU TODAY HAS A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF BENEFITS AND CO BENEFITS UP AND DOWN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA INCLUDING TO ADDRESS THE DROUGHT ISSUES IN YOUR SPECIFIC AREA- THAT YOU REPRESENT IN THE PORTABLE AREA AND WE ALL RECOGNIZE AND UNDERSTAND THE SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES THAT EXISTING YOUR SPECIFIC DISTRICT SO I MEAN TO THE POINT OF- WHAT'S BEFORE US TODAY- WHETHER YOU SUPPORTED THIS BOND OR NOT TODAY YOU WILL REAP SIGNIFICANT BENEFITS. FROM INVESTMENTS GOING BACK TO YOUR DISTRICT AS A RELIGIOUS MATTER OUTSIDE YOUR CALLING MR GARCIA WE WE'VE HEARD THIS TIME AND AGAIN THIS THIS TURNS INTO WE'RE WE'RE GONNA GET SOME STUFF FOR YOUR DISTRICT YOU'RE GOING TO GET SOME STUFF FOR YOUR DISTRICT IN FOR YOUR DISTRICT AND FOR YOUR DISTRICT IN IN THE LAUNDRY LIST. OF PROJECTS GOES ON AND ON. BY NO MEANS AT THIS POINT IN TIME. DO I THINK WE SHOULD CONTINUE A LAUNDRY LIST OF PROMISES BECAUSE WE'VE DONE THE LAUNDRY LIST OF PROMISES. IN IN IN THE FACE ALL OF THIS LANGUAGE. IS THEIR SEQUEL EXEMPTION. FOR ALL OF THESE PROJECTS FOR CLIMATE CHANGE THAT WE KNOW HAS TO GET DONE. BUT YET THE READ THAT THE TAPE THE BUREAUCRACY TIES IT UP. WHERE IS THAT BECAUSE IT'S NOT IN HERE. WHERE IS THE PROCESS OR NOT SPENDING OVER 80% OF THIS MONEY. ON GOVERNMENT BUREAUCRACY ADMINISTRATIVE OVERHEAD IN THREE HUNDRED PLUS PAGE DOCUMENTS THAT THREE TO FIVE AGENCIES HAVE TO GET JUST TO GET THROUGH WHAT ONE STEP. ALL OF THIS MONEY ALL IT THEY'RE GREAT PROMISES BROUGH. BUT WE'VE BEEN PROMISING THE PUBLIC THIS STUFF FOR NEAR DECADE. WHERE IS IT BE BECAUSE YOU YOU CAN TELL ME THAT THIS IS GONNA BE GREAT FROM MY DISTRICT THIS IS GONNA BE GREAT FOR YOUR TO. THE TALKING POINTS ARE ON POINT. THEY'RE ABSOLUTELY CORRECT AND I KNOW WE ALL WANT TO SEE THEM. BUT THIS DOES NOT CHANGE THE PROCESS. OF DELIVERABLES. IT IS WITH THAT SADLY I FEEL IT'S ANOTHER FALSE PROMISE I KNOW WE ALL WANT TO SEE IT WE'VE WE'VE TALKED ABOUT IT FOR OUR TEAM HERE UP HERE. WHERE'S THE DELIVERABLES BECAUSE THIS DOESN'T CHANGE THE PROCESS IS ANOTHER PROMISE. WILL OF- WE NEED TO WORK ON A BILL RELATED TO THE PROCESS I'M HAPPY TO- YOU KNOW PARTNER UP WITH YOU AND OTHER MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE BEFORE YOU. TODAY IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO BRING GREAT INVESTMENTS TO PLACES LIKE YOURS AND OTHER LOCATIONS IN THE STATE THAT NEEDS A SAFE CLEAN DRINKING WATER AND THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF RESOURCES. OUTLINED HERE NOT A LAUNDRY LIST OF GIMMES ARE YOU KNOW CHRISTMAS GIFTS BUT REAL TANGIBLE INVESTMENTS THAT COULD CHANGE CIRCUMSTANCES. UP AND DOWN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA INCLUDING YOUR DISTRICT HAS A RELEASE A SAFE CLEAN DRINKING WATER THANKS AGAIN MR GARCIA WE WE'VE HAD THIS BEFORE. IN WHEN I GOT ELECTED WE WHEN WE MATTER FACT GOT ELECTED. IN THE FOURTEEN ELECTIONS WE CAME IN WE MADE PROMISES TO EACH OTHER THAT THEY WERE GOING TO GO AFTER THE STUFF I STILL TO THIS DAY HAVE PEOPLE IN MY DISTRICT THAT LIVE IN THIRD WORLD CONDITIONS. DUE TO WATER BECAUSE OF FALSE PROBLEM. PROMISES. FROM THIS BODY FROM PREVIOUS BODIES OVER BONDS OVER WE'RE GOING TO DO THESE THINGS THE MONEY'S GOING TO COME. VOTE WITH US WE'RE GONNA MAKE THIS HAPPEN WE'RE GOING TO CREATE THESE JOBS. THEY'RE STILL LIVING IN THIRD WORLD CONDITIONS. SO UNTIL THAT PROCESS CHANGES AND WE CAN MAKE GOOD ON THESE PROMISES. YOU CAN TELL ME THIS IS GONNA BE GREAT ALL DAY LONG. BUT UNTIL WE ACTUALLY SEE A FEASIBLE CHANGE IN THE POLICY TO MAKE IT HAPPEN. VERSES RHETORIC. ABSOLUTELY NOT. HEY MR STONE. THANK YOU WHEN I CAN ASK YOU WHERE PREVIOUS BONDS HAVE BEEN SPENT THAT'S MY JOB TO FIGURE OUT NOT YOURS ON ON THIS THEN I'LL GIVE YOU A GREAT EXAMPLE OF PROJECTS HAVE BEEN FUNDED BY BOND MONEY IN THE PAST AND THAT IS PROJECTS THAT ARE DONE THROUGH THE INTEGRATED. REGIONAL WATER. MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS. AND THOSE ARE PROJECTS THAT. THAT I'M WORRIED OR NOT REALLY INCLUDED IN HERE BECAUSE OF. SOME OF THE LACK OF SPECIFICITY IN THE LANGUAGE AROUND THE WATER. AND WHY I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT. IS THIS IS ABOUT RESILIENCE. BUT LOCAL AGENCIES THROUGH THESE REGIONAL PROGRAMS REGIONAL INTERESTS. REGIONAL WHICH MEANS THAT THEY'RE VETTED BY LOCAL AGENCIES MULTIPLE LOCAL AGENCIES. THESE ARE PROJECTS TO BENEFIT HABITAT. THE BENEFIT WATER SUPPLY THE BENEFIT FISHERIES THAT HAVE TRULY MULTIPLE BENEFITS. AND WE DON'T THINK OF THESE PROGRAMS AS PART OF THE RESILIENCE. BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN AROUND FOR A WHILE WE'VE BEEN FUNDING THEM BUT THEY'VE BEEN DOING RESILIENCE FOR A LONG TIME. SO I JUST WANT TO ASK AND- THIS GARCIA THANK YOU WE GOT A AN ANSWER THIS MORNING TOSOME QUESTIONS WE'VE BEEN ASKING FOR A WHILE AND I APPRECIATE THAT- BUT I DISAGREE THAT THE LANGUAGE IN THEIR NECESSARILY COVERS THESE KINDS OF PROGRAMS. SO THAT IS SOMETHING I'M ASKING IF WE CAN STRENGTHEN. BECAUSE THOSE ARE TRUE RESILIENCE PROGRAMS THAT HAVE BEEN HUGELY SUCCESSFUL THAT HAVE NOT BEEN HELD UP BY SEEK WITH IT HAVE NOT BEEN HELD UP AND IT'S NOT. POLITICAL RHETORIC BECAUSE THEY TAKE. LOCAL AGENCIES HAVING TO VET THEM. AMONGST EACH OTHER AND WITH THE PUBLIC AND. AND SOME VERY VERY SUCCESSFUL RESULTS IN FORCING THE CENTRAL COAST BUT REALLY ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO WE FUNDED THIS PROGRAM THROUGH THESE BONDS BEFORE THE RETURN ON INVESTMENT IS HUGE AND DATE THESE ARE REALLY VERY GOOD PROGRAM SO I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE. THAT WERE CLEAR THAT THOSE PROGRAMS WILL BE ABLE TO TAP INTO THESE TO THESE BONDS AND CONTINUE THE WORK THAT THEY'VE BEEN DOING SOMEONE UNDERSCORE AGAIN THESE ARE RESILIENCE PROJECTS THAT HAVE BEEN GOING ON LONG BEFORE RESILIENCE BECAME SOMETHING THAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT HERE. SO THAT'S MY ONLY ASK IS THAT IS THAT YOU CONSIDER THOSE PROGRAMS BECAUSE OF THE BENEFITS THAT THEY HAVE BOTH. TO WATER SUPPLY AND TO THE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS THERE BUT ALSO THE REGIONAL ASPECTS IN REGIONAL ASPECTS. BENEFITS OFFSHORE BENEFITS TO THE FISHERIES AND OTHERS SO I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE WE'RE NOT FORGETTING THE PROGRAMS THAT HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL ALONG THE WAY. AS WE ARE PUTTING TOGETHER THIS NEW BOND SO THANK YOU FOR THAT THANK YOU MRS ON IF I MAY JUST RESPONDED THAT WE CERTAINLY ARE OPEN TO- BE MORE SPECIFIC WHEN IT COMES TO THE- LANGUAGE RELATED TO THE INTEGRATED REGIONAL WATER MANAGEMENT PLAN WE RECEIVE SOME FEEDBACK FROM OTHER. PARTS OF STATE WHERE THIS PROCESS HAS WORKED YEAH- YOU KNOW INITIALLY WE LOOKED AT THIS AND SEE IN THE SECTION OF REGIONAL CLIMATE ADAPTATION- SPECIFICALLY TO ADDRESSING RESILIENCY RIGHT- THERE'S- A HUNDRED FIFTY. MILLION DOLLARS IN THAT AREA BUT- IF THE NEED TO BE MORE SPECIFIC- IN TERMS OF ELIGIBILITY FOR THE- I. R. W. ENDS UP WILL. DEFINITELY KEEP THAT IN MIND AS WE MOVE FORWARD THANK YOU THAT'S MY ASK OUR PROJECT. THANK YOU MISTER- DOCTOR. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I WOULD TO SAY IT SAY THANK YOU THE AUTHORS AROUND THE FIRE SECTIONS- THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS TO THE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES FOR PRE HAZARD MITIGATION GRANT PROGRAM PREVENT WILDFIRES REDUCE THE RISK OF WILDFIRES TO COMMUNITIES BY INCREASING COMMUNITY HARDENING. THANK YOU- HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS TO THE REGIONAL FIRE FORCE CAPACITY PROGRAM TO INCREASE REGIONALS A CAPACITY PRIORITIZE DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT PROJECTS THAT IMPROVE FOREST HEALTH AND FIRE RESILIENCE THANK YOU THESE ARE BOTH. THOSE THAT WE'VE BEEN WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON MY OFFICE. A HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS TO DEPARTMENT FORESTRY AND FIRE PROTECTION TO SUPPORT VARIOUS LONG TERM FOR STILL PROJECTS I WAS ALSO THAT WAS. OUT OF S. B. NINE A ONE I THANK YOU. WHAT I DO WANT TO ASK YOU TO CONSIDER-% IS- SOMETHING AROUND CANNABIS- CLEANUP- PROP SIXTY FOUR. PROMISED TO MONEY TO HELP CLEAN UP THE ENVIRONMENT FROM ILLEGAL CANNABIS GROWS AND- IT'S NOT ENOUGH. AND MATTER OF FACT IS JUST BARELY TRICKLING IN AT THIS POINT- THE INITIATIVE WAS PASSED IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN LEGALIZATION HAPPEN IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN. THESE TRESPASS GROWS HAVE CONTINUED TO GROW AND PULLED PROLIFERATE THEY DO INCREDIBLE ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE TO OUR WATERSHEDS OUR BIODIVERSITY. ENDANGERED SPECIES AND MUCH MORE. WHETHER WE DO THIS AS A DIRECT APPLICATION ALLOCATION TO D. F. TO A D. TO THE DFW FUND OR- OR MAKE CANNABIS CLEAN UP AN ELIGIBLE EXPENSE- IN THE OTHER WATERSHED FOCUSED PROGRAMS I THINK WOULD BE A WERE THE USE OF THIS. OF THESE FUNDS. SO IF YOU'RE WILLING TO CONSIDER THIS I'D BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOU WE KNOW THIS ISSUE WELL. WE'VE DEALT WITH THIS ISSUE IT WAS ONE OF MY DRIVING FORCES FOR WORKING ON. THE MEDICAL CANNABIS REGULATORY SAFETY ACT IN TWENTY FIFTEEN- INCREDIBLE DAMAGE BEING DONE TO OUR WATERSHEDS. ON IN THIS YEAR IN A DROUGHT SITUATION WE'RE EXPECTING THAT THEY'LL BE A LOT OF ILLEGAL DIVERSIONS- FOR. FOR ROAD CANNABIS GROWS- OF WATER IN A DROP. THAT IS GOING TO AFFECT US ALL IN A REALLY REALLY SIGNIFICANT HUESO DEATH YOUR CONSIDERATION THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY OTHER MEMBERS WISH TO SPEAK. AT THE THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THE WORK YOU'VE BEEN DOING- INVOLVED IN DOING ON THIS- N. AS AS THE WORK CONTINUES I HAVE INTERESTS AND HOW WE'RE GOING TO BE A DEFINING- PARK POOR NEIGHBORHOODS- AND- I HAVE INTEREST IN. HOW WE START TO PUT SOME ADDITIONAL GUARDRAILS ARE INFORMATION AROUND THE FOUR HUNDRED MILLION TO THE STATE WATER BOARDS IN THE HUNDRED MILLION FOR WATER BIRDS ON THE WATER CONTAMINATION AND CLEAN WATER ISSUES. I DO APPRECIATE THAT MONEY- AND SO IT'S NOT A COMPLAIN IT'S MY DISCUSSES DETAILS MOVE ON ONE OF THE ISSUES WE SAW IT AS WE WANT TO HAVE SOME OF THOSE DEFINITIONS. MADE IT TO THAT'S ON MY LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES STILL THAT I'M QUALIFY ON AND SUGGESTED EARNING FROM THAT FOR A LITTLE MORE NEW ONES ALONG THE WAY- AND SO I DO APPRECIATE THE WORK THAT'S- THAT YOU'RE DOING ON THIS- WE HAVE A LOT OF EMERGING CHEMICALS INCLUDING P. FILES. THAT JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE PREPARED FOR THAT- AND WHILE WE CAN'T THINK OF EVERYTHING THAT WE'RE LIVING ENOUGH FLEXIBILITY IN THAT LANGUAGE AWAY WILL TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS ON THE ROAD- AND SO. THANK YOU. HEY MISTER FLOOR THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR- GENTLEMAN I THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD I JUST HAVE ONE QUICK QUESTION I JUST DIG INTO ONE PARTICULAR- SECTION THERE'S FORTY MILLION DOLLARS- TO CDFA AS IT RELATES TO- METHANE EMISSION REDUCTION FOR DAIRY LIVESTOCK. DOES THAT INCLUDE OR EXCLUDE DIED YESTERDAY. IT I GUESS YOURS WOULD BE- ELIGIBLE WE ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT OUT FORTY MILLION DOLLARS- WON'T GO VERY FAR CORRECT WHEN IT COMES TO ADDRESSING THE SPECIFIC ISSUE OF BY TESTERS IN THE STATE SO RIGHT NOW THAT FORTY MILLION DOLLARS WILL NOT JUST BE GOING THROUGH A MMP CURVE MMP BUT IT ELIGIBLE FOR DIGESTIVE AS WELL CORRECT THAT'S THE WAY I UNDERSTAND IT YES. OKAY BECAUSE ONE OF THE THINGS WE'VE TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT I MEAN THROUGH THE- LAST NUMBER OF YEARS THROUGH CARB. CDFA YOU KNOW ALL PREVIOUSLY HISTORICALLY ALLOCATIONS OF MONIES TO THOSE AGENCIES HAVE BEEN TECHNOLOGY NEUTRAL. MR STONE IS BROUGHT DOWN TO A POINT FORWARD I THOUGHT WAS VERY VERY- LIKE WE CANNOT FORGET ABOUT THE PROGRAMS THAT HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN THE PAST RIGHT NOW METHANE DIED YESTERDAY. REDUCE UP TO FORTY PERCENT. OF OUR GREENHOUSE GAS AS FAR AS METHANE PRODUCTION WITHIN- CATTLE AND DAIRY. SO I AM JUST VERY VERY CONCERNED THAT IF THAT IS NOT ABSOLUTELY CLEAR. BECAUSE WE WENT THROUGH THIS AN ATTIC- COMMITTEE A FEW WEEKS OR LAST WEEK. AND SOME OF THE OPPOSITION TO THIS- IS REALLY REALLY AGGRESSIVE. AND THEY'RE REALLY REALLY LOUD. AND IF WE ACTUALLY CARE ABOUT METHANE REDUCTION GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION CO TWO REDUCTION WE CANNOT. JUST PICK AND CHOOSE WHAT TECHNOLOGIES WE WANT THIS MONEY TO BE AVAILABLE WE HAVE TO USE BEST PRACTICES. AND RIGHT NOW I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH YOU FORTY MILLION IS SIGNIFICANTLY ON I'D LOVE TO SEE A CLOSER TO A HUNDRED. AND HOPEFULLY WE CAN GET IT THERE- IT'LL BE INTERESTING TO SEE WHAT THE GOVERNOR HAS IN HIS BUDGET AS WELL. BUT I DO WANT SOME SORT OF COMMITMENT THAT AS THIS THING MOVES FOR BECAUSE I KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF MOVING PIECES RIGHT NOW- YOU KNOW COMING OUT OF THAT COMMITTEE AS WELL THAT YOU'RE WORKING WITH ON THE CHAIR. JERRY THIS. IS THERE A COMMITMENT THAT WE CAN MAKE SURE IN LANGUAGE. THAT METHANE DIGESTION ARE INCLUDED. IN THIS FUNDING. IT WILL CONTINUE TO WORK ON THAT AND HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOU AND OTHERS THAT ARE INTERESTED IN SEEING THAT. AMOUNT INCREASE. AND TALK ABOUT THE SPECIFICS IN THE LANGUAGE FOR PURPOSES OF ELIGIBILITY WE TO. AS I MENTIONED IN MY OPENING COMMENTS ARE LOOKING TO- THIS SURPLUS THAT'S BEFORE US TO SEE HOW FAR WE CAN STRETCH OUT. SOME OF THOSE INVESTMENTS THAT THAT WILL ALIGN WITH THE INVESTMENTS THAT WE HAVE. BEFORE US TODAY BUT THE I THINK THE CORE OF YOUR QUESTION IS. CAN WE DO MORE IN TERMS OF THE AMOUNT- WE CERTAINLY ARE OPEN TO THAT. AND THE SECOND PART OF YOUR QUESTION IS THE ISSUE OF THE TECHNOLOGIES AND WILL CERTAINLY- THEY FOCUSED ON THAT. PART AS WELL IN THE COR MY QUESTION AND WE'VE HAD THESE CONVERSATIONS AS I WANT TO STOOP TO USE BEST PRACTICES. AND THE AND WE AS A ANALECTA BODY. IT'S OUR JOB TO GO FIND OUT FUNDING. SO ARE AGENCIES CAN GO DO THEIR JOBS.
