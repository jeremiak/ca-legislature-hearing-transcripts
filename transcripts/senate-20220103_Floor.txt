CENTER GROVE. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I'M HONORED IN SOMEWHAT SADDENED TODAY TO ANNOUNCE THE RETIREMENT OF RICHARD PAUL. WHO HAS SERVED AS A VALUED PROFESSIONAL STAFF MEMBER IN THE SENATE SINCE NINETEEN NINETY TWO AND HAS WORKED IN THE REPUBLICAN POLICY OFFICE SINCE NINETEEN NINETY NINE. PRIMARILY AS OUR CAUCUS CONSULTANT FOR THE GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATION COMMITTEE. SENATE REPUBLICAN LEADER WILKE WAS SCHEDULED TO SPEAK FIRST ABOUT RICHARD BUT SINCE HE WAS UNABLE TO BE IN SACRAMENTO TODAY HE ASKED ME TO LEAD OFF. IT HELPED HIM PLAN TO HONOR RICHARD IN PERSON TODAY ON THE FLOOR BUT HIS BATTLE WITH CANCER IS KEEPING HIM FROM BEING HERE. WE WERE DEVASTATED THAT RICHARD CAN'T BE WITH US ON THE FLOOR TODAY BUT WE KNOW THAT HE'S WATCHING THE SENATE FLOOR SESSION. FROM HIS LAPTOP WHERE HE'S CURRENTLY AT. I WANTED TO PERSONALLY WELCOME HIM ALBEIT VIRTUALLY- AND TO THE SENATE FLOOR. I AM HONORED TO RISE TODAY TO RECOGNIZE THE SERVICE STRENGTH COURAGE. AND JUST COMPLETE DEDICATION AND HARD WORK OF OUR DEAR FRIEND AND COLLEAGUE RICHARD PAUL. I COULD PROBABLY STAND HERE AND SPEAK FOR AN ETERNITY ON THE MERITS OF RICHARD'S WORK ON AS A COMMITTEE CONSULTANT. IN ON HIS DEDICATION TO THE FELLOWSHIP PROGRAM OR AS A VOLUNTEER AT THE CALIFORNIA STATE RAILROAD MUSEUM. HOWEVER TODAY I'D LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT A LITTLE ABOUT RICHARD'S HEALTH JOURNEY AND HIS DEDICATION TO BOTH PUBLIC SERVICE ABOVE ALL ELSE. AS MANY OF YOU KNOW DURING THE SUMMER OF TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN RICHARD WAS DIAGNOSED WITH METASTATIC SARCOMA. IT'S A VERY RARE FORM OF CANCER. THE DISEASE SPREAD TO HIS SPINE DAMAGED HIS SPINAL CORD AND IT RESULTED IN A PARTIAL PARALYSIS SURGERIES IN TOWARD MULTIPLE ROUNDS OF CHEMOTHERAPY AND SPENT MONTH AFTER MONTH AND HOSPITALS AND REHABILITATION FACILITIES DURING HIS EXTENSIVE TREATMENT. UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF STANFORD SARCOMA SPECIALIST DOCTOR CHRISTINE HAND YOU A REMARKABLE DEDICATED TEAM OF PHYSICIANS NURSES. AND OTHER PROVIDERS HAVE DELIVERED RICH RICHARDS EXCEPTIONAL CARE. HOWEVER IT'S RICHARD'S BROTHER BRAD. THAT HAS STOOD BY HIS SIDE AS A PRIMARY CARE GIVER IN SUPPORT SYSTEM. HE IS THE EPITOME OF ABSOLUTE SELFLESS LOVE. THE RESPECT AND ADORATION ADORATION THAT I HAVE FOR THESE CARETAKERS IS EXCEEDED ONLY BY GRATITUDE THAT I EXPRESSED TO THEM TODAY FOR ALL THAT THEY HAVE GIVEN. MY GRATITUDE ALSO EXTENDS TO ROGER MADISON. AVENUE GALLERY. RICHARDS CO WORKER AND LONGTIME STEADFAST FRIEND ROGER HAS SUPPORTED RICHARD IN EVERY CAPACITY AND HAS ACTED AS OUR PRINCIPAL LIAISON AS A SOURCE OF UPDATES.

I WANT YOU TO NOW THAT YOU PROVIDED AND WAVERING SUPPORT TO WHAT I THINK IS ARE PART OF A POLICY M. FAMILY THE FAMILY THAT WE LOVE AND TREASURE IN THIS BUILDING. YOU WERE THE ONE THAT GAVE US THE INFORMATION ON HOW TO PRAY. JOIN TOGETHER AND ASK GOD FOR FAVOR OVER THIS ILLNESS. AND I JUST THANK YOU FOR BEING THERE EVERY SINGLE DAY FOR ROGER APOLOGIZE. AND DESPITE ALL THE OBSTACLES AND CHALLENGES THAT RICHARD HAD FACED HE IS NOT LET THIS DISEASE DEFINE HIM OR HIS SPIRIT. RICHARD B. M. BORN RICHARD HAS BORNE ALL THE SUFFERING AND YES THIS TRAGEDY WITH EXTRAORDINARY COURAGE. AND UNPARALLELED SPRING STREAM AND REMARKABLE RESILIENCY. AND AN ABSOLUTE GRACE. RICHARDS HEART OF FAITH HAS NURTURED THE SOUL FULL OF HOPE CARRYING THROUGH THE MOST DIFFICULT YEARS. IN SECURING IN HIS HEART AND MIND THE KNOWLEDGE THAT HE IS THE SON OF AN ALMIGHTY GOD. IT IS BEEN AN ABSOLUTE HONOR BEING ABLE TO WORK WITH RICHARD IN A PROFESSIONAL CAPACITY THAT IS DEVELOPED INTO A WONDERFUL FRIENDSHIP OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS. HE IS FOR PROFESSIONAL WORTHY OF RECOGNITION AND PRAISE HIS DISTINGUISHED HIMSELF WITH HIS UNWAVERING COMMITMENT TO CIVIL SERVICE AND HIS DEDICATION IN WORKING FOR THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. UNDER THE MOST DIFFICULT PERSONAL CIRCUMSTANCES. PRESIDENT WOODROW-WILSON ONCE SAID THE EAR OF THE LEADER MUST RING WITH THE VOICES WORK THROUGHOUT THE YEARS REFLECTS HIS CALL TO INSURE THAT THE LEGISLATURE RESPONDS TO THE NEEDS OF THE CITIZENS AND HOW WE CAN SERVE THE PEOPLE OF THE GREAT STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AS THEY SAY LEADERSHIP IS SERVICE NOT POSITION AND WE'RE FORTUNATE TO WORK ALONGSIDE RICHARD AS A LEADER AND A FRIEND SOME IN THIS BUILDING FOR OVER THIRTY ONE YEARS. ON A PERSONAL LEVEL RICHARD AND I BECAME CLOSE DURING THIS TIME. THAT I SPENT AS THE MINORITY LEADER. I'M BLESSED TO HAVE SAT WITH HIM AND PRAYED WITH HIM TALK TO HIM ENJOYED HIS WISDOM AND DIRECTION WITH HIM AND HAVE EXPERIENCED THE PRESENCE OF HIS SOUL. RICHARD HAS BEEN NOTHING LESS THAN A BLESSING IN AN ABSOLUTE PLEASURE TO WORK WITH AND I WILL ALWAYS TREASURE TREASURE AT THE TIME THAT WE SPENT. WINSTON CHURCHILL EXPLAINED IT THIS WAY WE MAKE A LIVING BY WHAT WE GET WE MAKE A LIFE BY WHAT WE GIVE. RICHARD GAVE. THIRTY ONE YEARS TO THIS BUILDING IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IN DEDICATED SERVICE IN HIS LIFE. RICHARD PAUL WE ARE AMAZED AT YOUR STRENGTH DURING THIS DIFFICULT BATTLE AND I WANT TO RECOGNIZE YOUR DEDICATION TO THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA FOR OVER THREE DECADES. WE STAND WITH YOU AND WE WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT OUR PRAYER WARRIORS IN THIS BUILDING ARE SPEAKING WITH A PEACE AND STRENGTH AND HEALTH AND HEALING OVER YOU. EVERY SINGLE DAY. AS RICHARD IS THE LONGEST SERVING MEMBER IN A REPUBLICAN CAUCUSHE'S OFTEN REFERRED TO AS THE DEAN OF THE CAUCUS CONSULTANTS. SO IT'S NO BETTER- FOLLOW THAT I INTRODUCE THE DEAN OF THE SENATE- THAT HAS WORKED WITH RICHARD FOR A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF YEARS TO SPEAK ON RICHARD'S BEHALF AS WELL. NIELSEN THANK YOU. MADAM CHAIR. AND RICHARD. AS I HAVE LOOKED AT THE CAMERA. I FEEL THAT I'M LOOKING RIGHT AT YOU. I FEEL YOUR PRESENCE HERE. IN THIS INSTITUTION WITH US. YOU'RE NOT PIPED IN BY VIDEO YOU'RE HERE BECAUSE YOUR HEART TO SEE. I LAUGHED AND TOLD COLLEAGUES SIMPLY AS SENATE CONGRESS. YOU KNOW THE ONES WHO REALLY COUNT. ARE NOT THE ELECTED MEMBERS. BUT THE PEOPLE WHO WORK HERE. THE YOUNG SON. WHO WORK COUNTLESS PREPARING MEMBERS TO DO THEIR JOB ON BEHALF OF THE PEOPLE. HE HAD TENDERED UC BERKELEY. GETTING A DEGREE IN HISTORY. WHICH RELATES TO SOMEONE ELSE SPEAK OF LATER ALEX BASS. WHO IS OUR RESIDENT THE STORY. AND GIVE ME SOME INFORMATION. ABOUT RICH. HE WAS A SENATE FELLOW. A VERY INTERESTING POSITION MOST OF US HAVE ENJOYED FELLOWS IN OUR OFFICE IS WORKING. WE KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS. HE THEN HAS BECOME A STEWARD OF THE MENTOR IN THE SENATE FELLOWSHIP. AND WE MOST OF US HAVE ENJOYED HAVING FELLOWS. IN OFFICE. HE CAME HERE. FIRST WORKING. WITH SENATOR BILL AND. THEN BILL BAKER. AND ASSEMBLYMAN THE BAY AREA. BILL WYMAN FROM TO HATCH. AND THEN HE THE SENATE FELLOWSHIP PROGRAM. AND SERVED AS A GEO CONSULTANT BROUGHT TO THAT POSITION. BUT SENATOR KEN MADDY. A DEAR FRIEND AND NOW DECEASED. BUT VERY MUCH A PART. THIS INSTITUTION. CENTER BOARD JUST NOW REPRESENTS FRESNO I DO NOT REPRESENT IT. BUT I WAS BORN THERE. WITH THE SCHOOL THERE. IN MY HEART. IS THERE. AND I KNOW HOW. IN NEW VERY WELL AS REPUBLICAN LEADER. KEN WAS A VERY DISCERNING A MAN PERSON OF THE SENATE. RICHARD COULD NOT HAVE HAD. BETTER MENTAL. BUT THE VALUE LADIES AND GENTLEMAN THE SCENT OF AMENITY. IS WHAT DO THEY GIVE BACK. AND THIS MAN HAS GIVEN BACK SO MUCH. TO THE CENTER. TO THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE. THE CALIFORNIA. THE GAO COMMITTEE IS CALLED THE JEWISH COMEDIANS. ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES TO SPEAK NEXT SERVICES SHARE. THE ISSUES BEFORE THAT COMMITTEE COMPLEX. DO IT. WHEN INDIAN GAMING BECAME A PART OF CALIFORNIA. HE PARTICIPATED IN NEGOTIATIONS A MALL WAS PACKS. COMMUNICATING THEIR VALUE. WHAT WAS IN THEM UP WAS NOT. THEY BECAME AN EXPERT. IN THAT VERY UNIQUE NICHE. IT IS IN GAMING CAN CALIFORNIA. A VERY IMPORTANT PART THAT'S NOT JUST OUR ECONOMY BECAME ONE OF THE ARCHITECTS. OF WHAT WE NOW ENJOY. WITH THE INDIAN GAME. HE LATER WORKED FOR ROSS JOHNSON. FOR A TIME THEN HE BECAME A PART OF THE REPUBLICAN POLICY CONSULTANTS OFF. ESTEEMED IN THOSE COUNCILS OF HIS PEERS. WHEN THEY HEARD THAT I WAS GOING TO MAKE SOME REMARKS. BUT THAT MANY CALLS. FROM HIS PEERS WHO HAD WORKED WITH HIM. BEHIND THE SCENES SCENES THAT WE DID NOT SEE. WE'RE NOT A PART OF. BUT FROM WHICH WE GAIN THE VALUE. OF THE WISDOM THAT HE IMPARTED. IN THE RESIDENT HISTORY SO WHEN VIEWED IN THE SPARE. AND SO. ALEX VASSAR HAS TOLD ME THAT. HE HAD BEEN. THE THIRTY ONE YEAR CAREER. SERVING WITH FIVE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY NINE. LEGISLATORS OVER THOSE YEARS. INCLUDING TWO HUNDRED AND FOURTEEN. STATE SENATOR. DURING HIS TENURE. ALMOST THIRTY THOUSAND BUILT THE BEEN SIGNED INTO LAW. THAT'S NO MEAN FEAT TO BE ABLE TO STORE THOSE BILLS THROUGH AND COMMUNICATE TO THE MEMBERS OF THE VARIOUS COMMITTEES AND TO THE FLOOR. ON THE MERITS AND THE DEMERITS. OF THOSE MANY DEALS. HE WAS AN AFICIONADO. OF TRAINS. HE LOVED TRAINS. DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH A PART OF THE HISTORY OF THIS STATE. THINGS ARE. I THINK OF THE PROMONTORY POINT IN THE DRIVING OF THAT. LAST SPIKE. CONNECTED EAST AND WEST AND MID WEST AMERICA. HE KNEW ABOUT THAT HE THEY HAD A HAD A ROLE WORKING THROUGH THE- HISTORIC TRAIN MUSEUM IN OLD SACRAMENTO JUST A FEW BLOCKS AWAY FROM HERE. HE LEARNED THE RULES OF BEING A BRAKEMAN. A LOT OF COUNTRY SONGS ABOUT THE BREAK. THEIR BRAVERY. IT IS A CONDUCTOR. HE WAS A MAINTENANCE OF WAY TECHNICIAN. AND HE BURNED A FEDERAL CERTIFICATE. AS A SHIP TO CERTIFY. THE SAFETY OF OUR RAILROADS. AS MY COLLEAGUE FROM BAKERSFIELD IS MENTIONED HE'S COME UP ON A STUMBLE ALONG THE WAY. WE NEVER KNOW WHEN THOSE MOMENTS THEY OCCUR. IN OUR LIVES. THAT IS NOT THE QUESTION. THE QUESTION IS HOW DO WE- HOW DOES RICHARD DEAL. WITH THAT SITUATION. AS HE IS NOW AND WHAT CAN WE DO ABOUT. I ALWAYS FIND REFUGE IN PEACE IN MY HEART AND SOUL IN PRAYER- CERTAINLY THAT'D RICHARD TO MY PRAYERS. AND I KNOW THAT THOSE WILL TOUCH IT. AND HAVE THEIR VALUE. TO HIM. AND I KNOW THE LORD DOES LISTEN TIMER ASKED BY SOMEONE TO PRAY FOR THEM. BECAUSE JIM GARD LISTENS TO YOU. NO I LAUGHED AND I SAID NO. GOD LISTENS TO EVERYBODY. IF I HAVE ANY PURCHASE WITH THE LORD JUST I HAVE A LOT MORE TO PRAY ABOUT THE MANY. WELL RICHARD IS ONE THAT WE SHOULD DO TO ADD TO OUR PRAYERS NOW. THIS IS A CHALLENGING TIME. AND ALL MY PRAYERS. FOR RICHARD. THERE'S A VERSE IN THE BIBLE. MAY THE PEACE OF GOD WHICH SURPASSES ALL UNDERSTANDING. GUARD YOUR HEARTS. AND MINDS THROUGH CHRIST JESUS. I BELIEVE THAT RICHARD FEELS THAT PRESENCE IN HIS LIFE ARE TESTIMONIES TO HIM. BECAUSE TO BE REMINDED OF THAT AGAIN. TO RELIVE THE WONDERFUL MOMENTS OF HIS LIFE AND WONDERFUL ACCOMPLISHMENTS THAT HE WROTE HERE. AND HE- LIKE HIS MENTORS INCLUDING CENTER MAY. WILL LIVE ON IN THIS INSTITUTION. MANY MEMBERS ARE. ULTIMATELY NOT TOO MEMORABLE. BUT SOME DO LIVE ON WITHIN CTM INTO INSTITUTION. AND EVEN FEWER STAFF. OREGON RECOGNIZED OR REMEMBERED. WHEN I'M CRUISING AROUND THE CAPITAL FOLKS. THOSE UNKNOWN VOICES. THE GIVE US GOOD COUNSEL. PLATING. DOES IT- JANET. PARKER CARS. THE SPECIAL SERVICES. THEY'RE THE ONES. THERE ARE THE ARCHITECTS OF OUR SUCCESS. IT IS NOT ABOUT US IT'S ABOT WHAT THEY GIVE US. AND WHAT THEY THREW US. GET TO THIS INSTITUTION. THE GOVERNOR OF THE STATE. RICHARD HAS BEEN A PART. OF ALL OF THAT. FOR OVER THREE DECADES. WE WISH YOU PEACE OF HEART. I UNDERSTAND. OF STRENGTH. THESE CHALLENGING TIMES. AND WHEN- NOTWITHSTANDING ANY CHALLENGES THAT WE FACE. WE LOOK TO THE LORD. HE WILL BRING US THAT PEACE. WHICH SURPASSES ALL UNDERSTANDING. FATHER IN HEAVEN MAY THAT BE. RICHARDS REWARD. YOUR GRACE BE UPON HIM YOUR BLESSINGS BE UPON HIM. AND LET HIM LIVE FULLY EVERY SINGLE DAY AND MOMENT. BEFORE YOU TAKE IT HOME. SENATOR DODD. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT AND MEMBERS AS CHAIR OF THE SENATE GEO I'M HONORED TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SAY A FEW WORDS ABOUT THE DISTINGUISHED CAREER OF RICHARD PAUL. WHEN I FIRST BECAME CHAIR OF GEO MY COMMITTEE STAFF WAS ADAMANT THAT THE THAT RICHARD COULD BE ONE OF THE FIRST PEOPLE THAT I MEET. HIM WHEN I MET HIM. I UNDERSTOOD EXACTLY WHY THEY HAD THAT IT MIGHT. NOT ONLY WAS INCREDIBLY KNOWLEDGEABLE ABOUT THE ISSUES. BUT HE WAS ABSOLUTELY HONEST AND COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH ME AND MY STAFF AND OPEN AND BIPARTISAN MANNER. A COMMITMENT. THAT HAS NEVER FALTERED. THROUGHOUT MY CHAIRMANSHIP HE'S BEEN A SOUNDING BOARD FOR MY STAFF TOGETHER THEY'VE HELPED ME IN SHARING WHAT I HOPE IS A WELL RUN COMMITTEE THAT WORKS ACROSS THE AISLE TO IMPROVE THE LIVES. OF EVERYBODY IN THE STATE. AT A TIME WHEN BIPARTISANSHIP IS NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO ACHIEVE. I HOPE WE CAN TAKE RICHARD'S COMMITMENT AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW POLICY CAN BE IMPROVED. BY WORKING TOGETHER. FOR EVERYONE HERE SAID BILLS REFERRED TO GEO I CAN TELL YOU THAT MANY TIMES THE REASON WHY YOUR BILLS RECEIVE THAT NUMBER OF VOTES THAT THEY DID. WAS BECAUSE OF THE WORK THAT RICHARD DID BEHIND THE SCENES TO ENSURE BIPARTISAN SUPPORT. I CAN I HOPE WE CAN TAKE THAT ALL. TAKE A MOMENT TODAY TO APPRECIATE THAT WORK. MY COMMITTEE STAFF OTH PAST AND PRESENT ALSO WANTED ME TO PUBLICLY SHARE THEIR GRATITUDE NOT ONLY FOR ALL YOUR HELP. BUT FOR YOUR FRIENDSHIP AS WELL RICHARD. THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA EVERY MEMBER OF THE LEGISLATURE IN ALL THE STAFF HERE OWES YOU A GREAT AMOUNT OF GRATITUDE I HOPE YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOUR WORK HAS AND WILL ALWAYS BE APPRECIATED. RICHARD THERE ARE SO MANY MORE WORDS I COULD SAY. ULTIMATELY THOUGH SOMETIMES THE SIMPLEST WORDS SAY IT BEST. THANK YOU. SENATOR JONES. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT AND MEMBERS RICHARD GOD BLESS YOU. AND WE ARE GIVING YOU OUR GREATEST GREETINGS FOR YOUR RETIREMENT. AND I JUST WANT TO SHARE KIND OF YOU KNOW BRIEFLY AS A MEMBER OF THE GEOCHEMISTRY- WHEN I FIRST GOT THERE AND READING THROUGH THEN ALICE'S- MAYBE THE SECOND OR THIRD WEEK I'M REALIZING THERE'S ACTUALLY SOME. PRETTY INTERESTING COMMENTS COMMENTARY AND THESE ANALYSIS AND WHAT I'M JUST CRACKED ME UP AND I START LAUGHING- WHO IS WRITING THIS STUFF. AND THEN OF COURSE MY STAFF- MISSION RICHARD PAUL AND SHORTLY AFTER THAT I GOT AN- OPPORTUNITY TO MEET HIM. AND- A. AND BUILD A RELATIONSHIP WITH THEM AS A MEMBER OF THAT COMMITTEE IN HIS ANALYSIS OR YOU ARE ALWAYS SPOT ON. INFORMATIVE FUNNY. OFTEN SATIRICAL AND MOST OF ALL THOUGHT PROVOKING. RICHARD ALWAYS HIT THE NAIL ON THE HEAD WHEN A BILL PROPOSED CREATING A NEW STATE AGENCY DEPARTMENT OR BUREAU. AS HE OFTEN ASKED POINTED QUESTIONS SUCH AS IT IS THERE NO OTHER EXISTING GOVERNMENT ENTITY THAT CAN BE UTILIZED INSTEAD OF REINVENTING THE WHEEL. AGAIN HERE'S A FAVORITE PASSAGE THAT RICHARD OFTEN PINNED TO QUOTE. WHY DO WE NEED A SEPARATE AND DISTINCT COMMISSION TO STUDY. THIS ISSUE YET AGAIN WHY ESTABLISHED YET ANOTHER COMMISSION IN THE STATE GOVERNMENT WHEN THE GOVERNOR HAS ALREADY ISSUED AN EXECUTIVE ORDER CREATING ESSENTIALLY THE SAME THING. AND I WELL MAYBE A QUESTION TO ALEX AZAR WOULD BE IS HOW MANY TIMES DID THAT SHOW UP IN IN A IN AN ANALYSIS. ONE OF RICHARD'S FAVORITE TARGETS WAS THE LITANY OF EXEMPTIONS. AND CARVE OUTS OF THE LEGISLATURE MAKES EVERY YEAR TO THE TIED HOUSE LAW. WITH RICHARD OFTEN RAISING THE QUESTION OF HOW ABOUT LETTING THE MODERN. MARKET PLACE DEAL WITH THIS RATHER THAN PROPPING UP THIS R. K. GOVERNMENT SYSTEM OF CONTROL. RICHARD STAYED. TRUE TO THE FREE MARKET PRINCIPLES AND WROTE. THE ABC ACTORS PUNCHED FULL OF HOLES ALREADY. WHY NOT JUST FIX THIS SECTION OF LAW SO THAT EVERY NEW DEVELOPMENT STADIUM ARENA THEATRE ETCETERA. DOES NOT NEED TO COME CRAWLING TO THE LEGISLATURE SEEKING LEGAL EXEMPTIONS SO THAT THEY MAY CONDUCT WHAT IN ANY OTHER INDUSTRY WOULD BE CONSIDERED COMMON BUSINESS PRACTICES. SOMETIMES THOSE ANALYSIS ARE HARD TO READ FOR SOME OF THE FOLKS THAT WE WORK WITH HERE IN THE CAPITAL. BUT I THINK THE MEMBERS OF OUR CAUCUS AND THE MEMBERS OF THE SENATE ENTIRELY. ARE GONNA MISS. SEEING RICHARD AROUND EVERYDAY WITH HIS- HAPPY COMMITTED DEMEANOR TO THE SERVICE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IN HIS RETIREMENT. WE'RE GONNA MISS IS THAT HIS TOUGH BUT ENTERTAINING ANALYSIS TO REALIGN AS WE SCRUTINIZE THE ALL TOO MANY PROPOSALS TO INCREASE THE SIZE OF GOVERNMENT SERVICE TO ALL OF US WE WISH YOU WELL IN RETIREMENT AND FOR A LONG AND MANY HEALTHY YEARS TO BE ABLE TO ENJOY IT. THANK YOU. SENATOR GROWTH WOULD YOU LIKE TO CONCLUDE. THANK YOU MADAM FOR A PRESIDENT I'D LIKE TO THINK OF THE SENATORS WHO SPOKE ON BEHALF OF RICHARD TODAY- WE PREVIOUSLY PRESENTED THIS FRAMED A RESOLUTION TO RICHARD. AND TO FOR ALL OF HIS ACCOMPLICES WORKING IN THE LEGISLATURE FOR MORE THAN THREE DECADES RICHARD I'D LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FOR OVER THREE DEDICATED DECADES AND YOUR DEDICATION AND UNWAVERING SERVICE TO THE PEOPLE. I ALSO WANT TO SAY ONE MORE TIME. R. ROGERS AND GREG I KNOW THAT YOU ARE- NOT FAMILY BUT BIOLOGICAL FAMILY TO RICHARD. AND THAT BRAD IS HIS DEVOTED BROTHER. BUT IF I COULD- BESTOW ANY- TITLE ON BOTH OF YOU GREG AND ROGER I WOULD LIKE TO SAY YOU HAVE BEEN THE GREATEST ON BIOLOGICAL BROTHERS OR FAMILY. THAT RICHARD COULD EVER POSSIBLY HAVE SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE TO THIS EXTRAORDINARY MAN.
