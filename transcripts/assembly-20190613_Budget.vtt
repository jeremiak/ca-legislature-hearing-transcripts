ELIGIBLE FOR THAT -- AT THE AYE

00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:29.248
ILLUSTRATED WITH THE FACT THAT

WITH THAT.

00:17:37.356 --> 00:17:38.690
YES SO I LOOKED INTO THAT BROUGH

00:17:38.757 --> 00:17:39.558
WE LOOKED INTO THAT BRIEFLY AND

00:17:39.625 --> 00:17:41.193
I WILL DEFER TO MY COLLEAGUE BUT

00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:43.195
THE THE SHORT ANSWER IS THAT --

00:17:43.262 --> 00:17:44.229
THE FUNDING FOR FREE COMMUNITY

00:17:44.296 --> 00:17:46.165

DEFER TO MY COLLEAGUE CHRIS.

00:17:56.041 --> 00:17:57.509
CERTAINLY -- SO ALL THE CULTURES

00:17:57.576 --> 00:17:58.177
THROUGHOUT THE STATE CAN

00:17:58.243 --> 00:17:59.745
PARTICIPATE -- THERE ARE CERTAIN

00:17:59.812 --> 00:18:01.213
REQUIREMENTS THAT THEY NEED TO

00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:02.781
MEET SUCH AS THE FEDERAL LOAN

00:18:02.848 --> 00:18:04.149
PROGRAMS WE WORK WITH THE

00:18:04.216 --> 00:18:05.417
CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE WHO IS

00:18:05.484 --> 00:18:06.852
ACTUALLY WORKED WITH --

00:18:06.919 --> 00:18:08.253
COMMUNITY COLLEGES TO HELP

00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:10.055
STUDENTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE TO

00:18:10.122 --> 00:18:11.190
ENSURE THAT THEIR COHORT DEFAULT

00:18:11.256 --> 00:18:13.258

00:18:13.325 --> 00:18:14.626
DONE BY.

00:18:14.693 --> 00:18:15.594
INSURANCE STUDENTS ARE IN THE

00:18:15.661 --> 00:18:17.563
THE PASSED OUT LOAN REPAYMENT

00:18:17.629 --> 00:18:19.731
PLANS OFTEN THOSE ARE INCOME

00:18:19.798 --> 00:18:21.667
BASED A REPAYMENT PLANS.

00:18:21.733 --> 00:18:23.469
SO ARE FURTHER UNDERSTANDING IS

00:18:23.535 --> 00:18:25.704
THAT LESS THAN 2% OF COMMUNITY

00:18:25.771 --> 00:18:27.339
COLLEGE STUDENTS STATEWIDE

00:18:27.406 --> 00:18:31.043
HAPPENED ROLE LOANS -- SO WE WE

00:18:31.109 --> 00:18:32.077
KNOW THAT THAT THERE IS A

00:18:32.144 --> 00:18:33.545
CONCERN IN.

00:18:33.612 --> 00:18:34.980
A SMALL NUMBER OF COLLEGES IN

00:18:35.047 --> 00:18:37.850
THE STATE HOWEVER WE THINK THAT --

00:18:37.916 --> 00:18:39.751
THE EXISTING PROGRAM INSURES

00:18:39.818 --> 00:18:42.521
THAT ALL STUDENTS HAVE ACCESS TO

00:18:42.588 --> 00:18:43.922
THE GREATEST FINANCIAL AID

00:18:43.989 --> 00:18:45.257
AVAILABLE TO THEM THE DIFFERENT

00:18:45.324 --> 00:18:47.125
TYPES OF PROGRAMS -- AND WE KNOW

00:18:47.192 --> 00:18:48.994
THAT THE CHANCES OFFICE IS MORE

00:18:49.061 --> 00:18:49.628
THAN WILLING TO WORK WITH THOSE

00:18:49.695 --> 00:18:51.396
DISTRICTS TO ENSURE THAT THEY

00:18:51.463 --> 00:18:52.831
WOULD REMAIN ELIGIBLE FOR ALL

00:18:52.898 --> 00:18:54.266
FEDERAL PELL GRANT PROGRAMS.

00:18:54.333 --> 00:18:55.834
AND HAVE DEFAULT RATES THAT

00:18:55.901 --> 00:18:59.805
WOULD DEFINITELY BE BELOW -- ANY

00:18:59.872 --> 00:19:00.405
THAT WOULD TRIGGER SANCTIONS.

00:19:00.472 --> 00:19:01.273
WELL I I HAD A DISCUSSION WITH

00:19:01.340 --> 00:19:03.141
THE CHANCELLOR OF THE LARGEST

00:19:03.208 --> 00:19:04.109
COMMUNITY COLLEGE IN MY DISTRICT

00:19:04.176 --> 00:19:06.745
AND THE REASON WHY THEY DON'T

00:19:06.812 --> 00:19:07.279
PARTICIPATE IS THAT THERE

00:19:07.346 --> 00:19:07.646
DEFAULT RATE.

00:19:07.713 --> 00:19:09.314
WAS OVER 34% IN THE LAST YEAR

00:19:09.381 --> 00:19:11.183
THEY DID PARTICIPATE SO THEY

00:19:11.250 --> 00:19:11.750
DON'T FEEL LIKE THEY CAN'T

00:19:11.817 --> 00:19:13.285
PARTICIPATE I DON'T THINK IT'S

00:19:13.352 --> 00:19:14.720
FAIR TO TIE.

00:19:14.786 --> 00:19:16.388
THIS FUNDING THAT'S SUPPOSED TO

00:19:16.455 --> 00:19:18.190
BE FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGE FOR ALL --

00:19:18.257 --> 00:19:19.491
TO CERTAIN REQUIREMENTS

00:19:19.558 --> 00:19:21.026
REGARDING THE FEDERAL LOANS

00:19:21.093 --> 00:19:26.632
BECAUSE THAT THAT RESULTS IN MY

00:19:26.698 --> 00:19:27.232
CONSTITUENTS NOT HAVING ACCESS

00:19:27.299 --> 00:19:29.735
TO IT.

00:19:29.801 --> 00:19:31.703

00:19:33.739 --> 00:19:35.841
LESSON. 22% OF THE STUDENTS IN

00:19:35.908 --> 00:19:37.175
COMMITTEE COLLEGE -- UTILIZE

00:19:37.242 --> 00:19:38.110
FEDERAL LOANS.

00:19:38.176 --> 00:19:39.177
THAT'S MY UNDERSTANDING BASED ON

00:19:39.244 --> 00:19:40.913
DATA THAT IS RECEIVED FROM THE

00:19:40.979 --> 00:19:41.847
CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE.

00:19:41.914 --> 00:19:44.116
THEN IF THE GOAL OF THE FUNDING

00:19:44.182 --> 00:19:47.986
IS TO ENSURE MORE THAT STUDENTS --

00:19:48.053 --> 00:19:49.655
PARTICIPATE IN AND ROLLING

00:19:49.721 --> 00:19:50.856
COMMITTEE COLLEGE AND I HAVE --

00:19:50.923 --> 00:19:52.391
COMMITTEE COLLEGES ALSO OR DON'T

00:19:52.457 --> 00:19:54.459
THE FALL INTO THE SAME CATEGORY --

00:19:54.526 --> 00:19:57.696
AS WAS OBERNOLTE AND IS THE WHY

00:19:57.763 --> 00:19:59.698
WOULD WE HAVE THAT CRITERIA.

00:19:59.765 --> 00:20:00.499
I THINK IT GOES TO THAT POINT OF

00:20:00.566 --> 00:20:01.934
ENSURING THAT STUDENTS HAVE

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:04.069
ACCESS TO THE GREATEST --

00:20:04.136 --> 00:20:06.371
ABILITY -- TO PARTICIPATE IN

00:20:06.438 --> 00:20:07.906
FINANCIAL AID OPPORTUNITIES THAT

00:20:07.973 --> 00:20:09.441
ARE OUT THERE INCLUDING FEDERAL

00:20:09.508 --> 00:20:11.376
LOAN PROGRAMS.

00:20:11.443 --> 00:20:13.378
BUT IF IF -- IF FUNDING IS

00:20:13.445 --> 00:20:15.747
PROVIDED BY THE STATE TO COVER

00:20:15.814 --> 00:20:17.516
THE ENROLLMENT COSTS WOULD AND

00:20:17.583 --> 00:20:20.919
THE WIND WE ELIMINATE THE NEED

00:20:20.986 --> 00:20:21.453
FOR THEM TO TAKE OUT MORE

00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:22.387
STUDENT LOANS.

00:20:22.454 --> 00:20:23.422
IT WOULD CERTAINLY REDUCE THEIR

00:20:23.488 --> 00:20:24.856
NEED TO TAKE OUT CERTAIN TYPES

00:20:24.923 --> 00:20:26.491

CHECK THE MAP THAT WE'VE GONE

00:27:36.654 --> 00:27:37.455
OVER.

00:27:37.522 --> 00:27:38.690
ABOUT WHAT THAT'S GOING TO COST

00:27:38.757 --> 00:27:40.859
THE AVERAGE CALIFORNIA IN TERMS

00:27:40.925 --> 00:27:43.928

YES SIR WE DID LOOK INTO IT AND

00:27:46.231 --> 00:27:47.298
ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES MAY BE ABLE

00:27:47.365 --> 00:27:48.333
TO SPEAK TO THAT AS WELL BUT WE

00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:50.568
ARE NOT ANTICIPATING ANY CHANGE

00:27:50.635 --> 00:27:52.670
IN THE DEDUCTION IN THE BUDGET

00:27:52.737 --> 00:27:54.839
YEAR -- SO IT ALL DEPENDS THESE

00:27:54.906 --> 00:27:56.341
ARE ALL ESTIMATES IT DEPENDS ON

00:27:56.408 --> 00:27:57.742
HOW MANY PEOPLE TAKE UP TO LEAVE

00:27:57.809 --> 00:27:59.077
AND FOR HOW LONG WHETHER THEY

00:27:59.144 --> 00:28:00.779
TAKE THE FULL EIGHT WEEKS -- BUT

00:28:00.845 --> 00:28:01.479
FOR THE FIRST YEAR OF

00:28:01.546 --> 00:28:03.915
IMPLEMENTATION WE'RE NOT

00:28:03.982 --> 00:28:05.850
ANTICIPATING A CHANGE.

00:28:05.917 --> 00:28:06.851
HI DANIEL BRAND OF A DEPARTMENT

00:28:06.918 --> 00:28:08.219
OF FINANCE I WOULD ALSO NOTE

00:28:08.286 --> 00:28:09.854
THAT WE'RE NOT ANTICIPATINGAN

00:28:09.921 --> 00:28:11.856
INCREASE IN THE FOLLOWING A YEAR

00:28:11.923 --> 00:28:13.324
AS WELL THE FIRST INCREASE.

00:28:13.391 --> 00:28:15.427
WOULD BE AND WE ESTIMATE WOULD

00:28:15.493 --> 00:28:18.029
BE AROUND TWENTY TWENTY TWO AND

00:28:18.096 --> 00:28:23.134
THAT'S A POINT 1% -- THANK YOU

00:28:23.201 --> 00:28:24.102
OKAY SO THE THE AND THAT'S WHAT

00:28:24.169 --> 00:28:25.170
THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST WAS

00:28:25.236 --> 00:28:26.838
SAYING ALSO WAS THAT IN THE LONG

00:28:26.905 --> 00:28:28.006
TERM.

00:28:28.073 --> 00:28:29.974
THIS HAD THE POTENTIAL TO COST

00:28:30.041 --> 00:28:32.277
CALIFORNIANS POINT 1% IN

00:28:32.343 --> 00:28:33.878
ADDITIONAL PAYROLL TAX DEDUCTION

00:28:33.945 --> 00:28:34.846
WHICH IF THE AVERAGE

00:28:34.913 --> 00:28:37.182
CALIFORNIANS WAGES SIXTY TWO

00:28:37.248 --> 00:28:38.316
THOUSAND YEAR.

00:28:38.383 --> 00:28:38.950
ABOUT SIXTY TWO DOLLARS A YEAR

00:28:39.017 --> 00:28:40.752
SO WOULD YOU WOULD YOU AGREE

00:28:40.819 --> 00:28:41.886
THAT THAT'S A REASONABLE

00:28:41.953 --> 00:28:43.655
ESTIMATE LONG TERM OF WHAT -- OF

00:28:43.721 --> 00:28:44.889
WHAT EXTENSION OF THE PAID

00:28:44.956 --> 00:28:46.658
FAMILY LEAVE PROGRAM WILL OR

00:28:46.724 --> 00:28:47.358
WILL COST.

00:28:47.425 --> 00:28:48.760
I GENERALLY I THINK YOU KNOW

00:28:48.827 --> 00:28:50.128
THOSE NUMBERS ARE IN LINE WITH

00:28:50.195 --> 00:28:51.062
WHAT WE ARE THINKING OF WOULD

00:28:51.129 --> 00:28:52.263
MAKE THE POINT THOUGH THAT THAT

00:28:52.330 --> 00:28:53.865
MONEY IS NOT BEING USED FOR

00:28:53.932 --> 00:28:55.633
OTHER PURPOSES BUT WOULD BE

00:28:55.700 --> 00:28:57.068
RETURNED TO PARTICIPANTS WERE.

00:28:57.135 --> 00:29:00.271
PAYING THAT IF THEY CHOOSE TO

00:29:00.338 --> 00:29:02.173
TAKE PAID FAMILY LEAVE.

00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:02.774
I'M SORRY I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND

00:29:02.841 --> 00:29:03.408
WHAT YOU JUST SAID -- SURE SAID

00:29:03.475 --> 00:29:05.143
THIS SIDE INCREASE OF POINT 1%

00:29:05.210 --> 00:29:06.678
WERE TO HAPPEN IT WOULD BE GOING

00:29:06.744 --> 00:29:08.213
INTO THE FUNDS SO IT WOULD NOT

00:29:08.279 --> 00:29:09.814
BE USED FOR OTHER.

00:29:09.881 --> 00:29:13.051
GENERAL FUND PURPOSES I

00:29:13.118 --> 00:29:14.352
UNDERSTAND SO YES. ONE OF THE

00:29:14.419 --> 00:29:15.019
THINGS THAT I OBJECTED TO IS THE

00:29:15.086 --> 00:29:15.487
WAY THAT THIS HAS BEEN

00:29:15.553 --> 00:29:16.688
CHARACTERIZED AS SOMETHING

00:29:16.754 --> 00:29:18.056
THAT'S NOT GOING TO COST

00:29:18.123 --> 00:29:19.157
CALIFORNIANS MONEY.

00:29:19.224 --> 00:29:20.091
AND THE POINT I'M TRYING TO MAKE

00:29:20.158 --> 00:29:21.559
IS THAT YES IT WILL COST EVERY

00:29:21.626 --> 00:29:24.229
CALIFORNIAN. SIXTY TWO DOLLARS A

00:29:24.295 --> 00:29:27.198
YEAR TO TO AFFECT THIS CHANGE.

00:29:27.265 --> 00:29:28.299
SO I THINK ARE ONLY RESPONSES TO

00:29:28.366 --> 00:29:29.200
FULL NUMBER ONE YOU KNOW WE

00:29:29.267 --> 00:29:30.368
DON'T ANTICIPATE THAT IN THE

00:29:30.435 --> 00:29:32.437
NEXT TWO YEARS AND SECOND AND

00:29:32.504 --> 00:29:33.438
THIS IS OF COURSE AN ONGOING

00:29:33.505 --> 00:29:35.306
PROCESS BUT THIS TASK FORCE IS

00:29:35.373 --> 00:29:36.774
STARTING UP AND WE'RE HOPING TO

00:29:36.841 --> 00:29:39.711
IDENTIFY THE PATH FORWARD --

00:29:39.777 --> 00:29:45.250
THIS IS JUST THE FIRST STEP.

00:29:45.316 --> 00:29:48.653
GIVING ANY OTHER COMMENTS.

00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:52.657
COMMENTS FROM THE PUBLIC.

00:29:52.724 --> 00:29:54.192
SEEING NONE.

00:29:54.259 --> 00:29:56.094
LET'S MOVE ON TO SB EIGHTY FOUR

00:29:56.161 --> 00:29:56.694
CAL ACCESS REPLACEMENT SYSTEM

00:29:56.761 --> 00:29:59.731
PROJECT.

00:29:59.797 --> 00:30:02.033
SO ONE MAJOR ITEM IN SB --

00:30:02.100 --> 00:30:03.301
EIGHTY FOUR THIS IS -- AN UPDATE

00:30:03.368 --> 00:30:05.136
TO CAL ACCESS -- FOR THE

00:30:05.203 --> 00:30:06.404
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NEW ONLINE

00:30:06.471 --> 00:30:08.139
FILING DISCLOSURE SYSTEM FOR

00:30:08.206 --> 00:30:09.707

DEADLINE FOR A FEBRUARY UNTIL

00:30:11.543 --> 00:30:13.378
FEBRUARY OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE

00:30:13.444 --> 00:30:14.279
THE REASON FOR THIS IS THAT THE

00:30:14.345 --> 00:30:15.847
CURRENT DEADLINE WOULD HAVE A

00:30:15.914 --> 00:30:17.348
NINETY DAY PERIOD.

00:30:17.415 --> 00:30:19.217
RIGHT IN THE MIDST OF THAT STATE --

00:30:19.284 --> 00:30:21.085
ELECTION SEASON NEXT YEAR AND

00:30:21.152 --> 00:30:22.887
THAT DEADLINE WAS SET BEFORE

00:30:22.954 --> 00:30:24.556
CALIFORNIA MOVED UP ITS PRIMARY

00:30:24.622 --> 00:30:26.758
NEXT YEAR FROM JUNE TO MARCH

00:30:26.824 --> 00:30:28.493
SERVICE PUSHES THAT DEADLINE TO

00:30:28.560 --> 00:30:30.028
AFTER THE ELECTION SEASON SO

00:30:30.094 --> 00:30:31.863
THAT THERE ARE NO -- THAT THEY

00:30:31.930 --> 00:30:32.697
WE HOPE THERE ARE FEWER HICK UPS

00:30:32.764 --> 00:30:36.634
AND IT ALSO PROVIDES SIX POINT

00:30:36.701 --> 00:30:37.135
NINE MILLION DOLLARS FOR

00:30:37.202 --> 00:30:37.669
IMPLEMENTATION [inaudible]

00:30:37.735 --> 00:30:38.703
THANK YOU.

00:30:38.770 --> 00:30:41.539
QUESTION TO THE COMMITTEE.

00:30:41.606 --> 00:30:44.709

00:30:44.776 --> 00:30:46.411
OKAY SEE NUMBERS COULD SB EIGHTY

00:30:46.477 --> 00:30:48.913
FIVE RESOURCES.

00:30:48.980 --> 00:30:51.049
SO THIS RESOURCES AVAIL -- THEIR

00:30:51.115 --> 00:30:52.350
NUMBER OF COMPONENTS TO IT ONE

00:30:52.417 --> 00:30:54.085
IS SIX AND EXTENSION OF THE

REVOLVING FUND.

00:31:02.694 --> 00:31:03.895
AND THIS BILL WOULD ALSO REQUIRE

00:31:03.962 --> 00:31:05.430
CAL FIRE TO COORDINATE WITH THE

00:31:05.496 --> 00:31:06.998

TO LIVE INSUFFICIENT FUNDS

00:31:37.128 --> 00:31:38.529
BASICALLY GIVING THEM A LITTLE

AUTHORITY TO RAISE THE FEES

00:51:11.134 --> 00:51:13.970
TOLERATE ANY MORE EXCUSES TO GET

00:51:14.037 --> 00:51:16.506
THIS DONE AND SO I I APPLAUD.

00:51:16.573 --> 00:51:17.374
THAT CHEERED THAT WE'RE MOVING

00:51:17.441 --> 00:51:19.776
IN THAT DIRECTION AND THEN ON

00:51:19.843 --> 00:51:21.244
THE THE GRANTS FOR THE

00:51:21.311 --> 00:51:23.980
CALIFORNIA RE ENTRY AND RICHMOND

00:51:24.047 --> 00:51:24.848
GRANTS I KIND OF WANT TO GET

ORGANIZATIONS YEAR KIND OF THE

00:51:27.717 --> 00:51:28.952
FEEL WOULD FALL INTO THAT

00:51:29.019 --> 00:51:29.553
CATEGORY.

TO SEE IF THEY CAN APPLY -- I

00:51:40.931 --> 00:51:43.233
THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT --

00:51:43.300 --> 00:51:45.001
DID YOU NEED GROUPS THAT HAVE OF

00:51:45.068 --> 00:51:47.504

00:52:12.095 --> 00:52:12.796
ABOUT.

00:52:12.863 --> 00:52:14.030
IS I BASS WHEN SOMEONE IS

00:52:14.097 --> 00:52:16.466
RELEASED AFTER GOING TO A

00:52:16.533 --> 00:52:17.033

ME THEY DON'T KNOW?

00:52:21.438 --> 00:52:23.607
AND I SAID SOMETIMES VERY EASY

00:52:23.673 --> 00:52:24.374
BY.

00:52:24.441 --> 00:52:26.743
GETTING A SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER

00:52:26.810 --> 00:52:28.044
CHECKING WITH WHETHER NOT THEY

00:52:28.111 --> 00:52:30.013
PAID THEIR STATE TAXES COULD

00:52:30.080 --> 00:52:31.014
TAKE PAY THEIR STATE TAXES

00:52:31.081 --> 00:52:31.848
UNLESS THEY'RE VERY GOOD

00:52:31.915 --> 00:52:32.282
CRIMINALS.

00:52:32.349 --> 00:52:33.884
GOING NINE TO FIVE WORK EVERY

00:52:33.950 --> 00:52:35.018
DAY AND THEN THEY'RE BEING

00:52:35.085 --> 00:52:36.720

00:52:38.622 --> 00:52:40.123
ALL NIGHT THEY'RE NOT DOING THAT.

00:52:40.190 --> 00:52:41.791
AND WHEN I ASKED WHY DON'T YOU

00:52:41.858 --> 00:52:43.994
CHECK WITH THE STATE FRANCHISE

00:52:44.060 --> 00:52:45.562
BOARD THEY SAID WOULD THEY CAN'T

00:52:45.629 --> 00:52:46.830
THEY'RE NOT ABLE TO DO THAT.

00:52:46.897 --> 00:52:48.164
AND THEY THEY PROBABLY NEED

00:52:48.231 --> 00:52:49.499
LEGISLATION AND A SIT IN FRONT

00:52:49.566 --> 00:52:50.600

ACTUALLY MAKE THAT LEGISLATION

00:52:52.903 --> 00:52:53.803
HAPPEN.

00:52:53.870 --> 00:52:56.139
WHY HAVEN'T YOU EVER COME TO US --

00:52:56.206 --> 00:52:59.042

EFFORT. TO TRY TO ACTUALLY GET

00:53:06.883 --> 00:53:08.018
THAT DONE I THINK THAT WILL HELP

00:53:08.084 --> 00:53:09.686
THEM IN THE LONG RUN IN THIS

00:53:09.753 --> 00:53:15.225
PART ABOUT WORKING WITH -- CDC

00:53:24.267 --> 00:53:25.168
WILL HAVE.

00:53:25.235 --> 00:53:27.337
A DRAMATIC IMPACT ON HOW MUCH

00:53:27.404 --> 00:53:28.939
MORE MONEY WE NEED TO PUT INTO

00:53:29.005 --> 00:53:37.514
REHABILITATION SO I COMMEND YOU

00:53:37.581 --> 00:53:42.085

00:53:42.152 --> 00:53:45.121

SECURITY NUMBERS WE KNOW MOST

00:53:49.292 --> 00:53:50.427
FOLKS DON'T GO BACK TO A PRISON.

00:53:50.493 --> 00:53:51.595
MAJORITY YOU'RE BEING SENT TO

LET'S MOVE ON TO SB. NINETY FIVE

TWO MAJOR CHANGES IN SB NINETY

00:55:26.489 --> 00:55:27.090
FIVE BOTH OF THEM RELATED TO THE

00:55:27.157 --> 00:55:27.724
COURTS THE FIRST -- AS PART OF

00:55:27.791 --> 00:55:28.291
THE BUDGET AGREEMENT IS THE

00:55:28.358 --> 00:55:29.459
INCLUSION OF TWENTY FIVE

00:55:29.526 --> 00:55:30.360
ADDITIONAL JUDGESHIPS AND THESE

00:55:30.427 --> 00:55:31.494
WOULD BE ALLOCATED BY THE

00:55:31.561 --> 00:55:32.495
JUDICIAL COUNCIL.

00:55:32.562 --> 00:55:33.997
AND THIS COMES AT A COST OF

00:55:34.064 --> 00:55:35.598
THIRTY POINT FOUR MILLION

00:55:35.665 --> 00:55:37.167
DOLLARS GENERAL FUND THE SECOND

00:55:37.233 --> 00:55:38.768
IS AN INCREASE IN THAT TRIAL

00:55:38.835 --> 00:55:41.371
CORPORATE SERVE CAP FROM 1% 23%

00:55:41.438 --> 00:55:43.006
EFFECTIVE JUNE OF NEXT YEAR

00:55:43.073 --> 00:55:44.240
WHICH WILL GIVE OUR TRIAL COURTS

00:55:44.307 --> 00:55:46.309
A LITTLE BIT MORE FLEXIBILITY IN

00:55:46.376 --> 00:55:49.112
THEIR BUDGETING.

00:55:49.179 --> 00:55:51.748
THANK YOU MISTER BROWN.

00:55:51.815 --> 00:55:52.348
TO JUST LIKE TO THANK YOU THE

00:55:52.415 --> 00:55:53.750
ADMINISTRATION FOR THE TWENTY

00:55:53.817 --> 00:55:54.818
FIVE JUDGESHIPS IT'S GONNA GO A

00:55:54.884 --> 00:55:56.219
LONG WAYS TOWARDS RESTORING

00:55:56.286 --> 00:55:57.754
ACCESS TO JUSTICE FOR THE PEOPLE

00:55:57.821 --> 00:55:58.722
THAT WE REPRESENT.

00:55:58.788 --> 00:56:01.124
HAD A QUESTION ABOUT RAISING THE

00:56:01.191 --> 00:56:03.093
TRIAL COURT RESERVE CAP -- IS

00:56:03.159 --> 00:56:04.894
YOU KNOW THAT CAP WAS IMPOSED

00:56:04.961 --> 00:56:07.130
AND DURING THE GREAT RECESSION.

00:56:07.197 --> 00:56:08.565
TO MAKE SURE THAT THE COURTS

00:56:08.631 --> 00:56:11.000
SPENT THROUGH THEIR RESERVES

00:56:11.067 --> 00:56:11.501
BEFORE THEY NEEDED STATE

00:56:11.568 --> 00:56:12.235
ASSISTANCE.

00:56:12.302 --> 00:56:13.369
THE QUESTION IS WHY DOES THERE

00:56:13.436 --> 00:56:15.672
NEED TO BE A CAP ANYMORE BECAUSE

00:56:15.739 --> 00:56:17.407
THERE WASN'T ONE BEFORE WHY IS

00:56:17.474 --> 00:56:21.211
3% THE RIGHT NUMBER OF 1% NOT.

00:56:21.277 --> 00:56:22.445
SO THE ADMINISTRATION DEFINITELY

00:56:22.512 --> 00:56:23.379
WANTED TO INCREASE THE CAP YOU

00:56:23.446 --> 00:56:24.514
KNOW NOW THAT WE ARE OUT OF THE

00:56:24.581 --> 00:56:25.115
RECESSION I THINK YOU'LL FIND

00:56:25.181 --> 00:56:26.983
WITH A NUMBER OF THESE PROGRAMS.

00:56:27.050 --> 00:56:28.017
THERE ARE GENERALLY CAPS IN

00:56:28.084 --> 00:56:30.420
PLACE AND I THINK THE REASON IS

00:56:30.487 --> 00:56:31.688
ONE IT MAKES AFFECTED BUDGETING

00:56:31.755 --> 00:56:34.324
PRACTICE WHERE YOU WANT --

00:56:34.390 --> 00:56:36.025
INSTEAD CITIES TO HAVE RESERVES

00:56:36.092 --> 00:56:37.093
BY IF THEY HAVE SUCH LARGE

00:56:37.160 --> 00:56:39.028
RESERVES WELL BEYOND WHAT THEY

00:56:39.095 --> 00:56:40.430
NEED THEN I THINK IT FOR THE

00:56:40.497 --> 00:56:42.132
ADMINISTRATION FOR LEGISLATORS

00:56:42.198 --> 00:56:43.600
FOR TAXPAYERS YOU WONDER WHY ARE

00:56:43.666 --> 00:56:44.734
WE APPROPRIATING MORE MONEY TO

00:56:44.801 --> 00:56:45.935
THEM WHEN THEY HAVE SUCH A BIG

00:56:46.002 --> 00:56:46.636
QUESTION.

00:56:46.703 --> 00:56:48.104
WHEN THAT MONEY COULD BE USED

00:56:48.171 --> 00:56:49.672
FOR OTHER PURPOSES BUT SO IT'S A

00:56:49.739 --> 00:56:50.974
BALANCE BECAUSE WE WANT TO MAKE

00:56:51.040 --> 00:56:51.975
SURE THAT RESERVE IS NOT TOO

00:56:52.041 --> 00:56:52.976
SMALL BECAUSE IT CAN MAKE

00:56:53.042 --> 00:56:54.744
PLANNING VERY UNPREDICTABLE?

00:56:54.811 --> 00:56:56.112
BUT WE ALSO BELIEVE ESCORTS OR

00:56:56.179 --> 00:56:57.981
OTHER ENTITIES TO HAVE A HEALTHY

00:56:58.047 --> 00:57:01.351
RESERVE THEN THAT MONEY CAN BE

00:57:01.417 --> 00:57:02.719
USED FOR OTHER PURPOSES.

00:57:02.786 --> 00:57:03.987
OKAY WELL I MEAN I THINK THAT

00:57:04.053 --> 00:57:04.654
THERE WERE SOME BAD ACTORS WHEN

00:57:04.721 --> 00:57:07.023
THE RESERVE WAS IMPOSED THE CAP

00:57:07.090 --> 00:57:08.158
WAS IMPOSED.

00:57:08.224 --> 00:57:09.726
BUT MOST OF OUR TRIAL COURTS ARE

00:57:09.793 --> 00:57:11.161
NOT BAD ACTORS AND THEY REALLY

00:57:11.227 --> 00:57:13.029
STRUGGLE WITH THAT RESERVE CAP

00:57:13.096 --> 00:57:15.465
IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT EVEN 3% IS

00:57:15.532 --> 00:57:15.665
JUST.

00:57:15.732 --> 00:57:16.800
A COUPLE WEEKS.

00:57:16.866 --> 00:57:18.268
OF RESERVE WHICH IS NOT VERY

00:57:18.334 --> 00:57:19.803
MUCH MONEY IS VERY DIFFICULT FOR

00:57:19.869 --> 00:57:21.704
TRIAL COURTS TO BUDGET FOR

00:57:21.771 --> 00:57:23.306
CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PROJECTS FOR

00:57:23.373 --> 00:57:24.374
EXAMPLE THAT ARE THAT ARE

00:57:24.440 --> 00:57:25.975
OUTSIDE THE NORMAL COURSE OF

00:57:26.042 --> 00:57:27.210
BUSINESS FOR THEM SO.

00:57:27.277 --> 00:57:28.244
I CONTINUE TO BELIEVE THE REALLY

00:57:28.311 --> 00:57:29.813
WE DON'T NEED A RESERVE CAP

00:57:29.879 --> 00:57:35.285
ANYMORE BUT % BETTER THAN 1%.

00:57:35.351 --> 00:57:37.120
THANK YOU ANY OTHER.

00:57:37.187 --> 00:57:40.390
COMMENTS THE COMMITTEE.

00:57:40.456 --> 00:57:42.559
OKAY SEE NO MORE BECAUSE THE

00:57:42.625 --> 00:57:44.627
CLEANING THE PUBLIC COMMENT.

00:57:44.694 --> 00:57:50.233
SEE NUMBERS MOVE ON THE SB.

00:57:50.300 --> 00:57:50.834
NINETY SIX SIR SB NINETY SIX

00:57:50.900 --> 00:57:51.434
REFERS TO THE STATE EMERGENCY

00:57:51.501 --> 00:57:53.169
TELEPHONE NUMBER ACCOUNT THIS IS

00:57:53.236 --> 00:57:54.938
THE SPECIAL FINDS THAT FUNDS

00:57:55.004 --> 00:57:56.806
IMPROVEMENT TO THE NINE ONE ONE

00:57:56.873 --> 00:57:58.842
SYSTEM THAT WAS ON THE VERGE OF

00:57:58.908 --> 00:58:00.109
INSOLVENCY.

00:58:00.176 --> 00:58:01.411
AND SO WHAT THIS TRAILER BILL

00:58:01.477 --> 00:58:03.012
DOES IS IT CHANGES THE CURRENT

00:58:03.079 --> 00:58:05.148
SYSTEM WHICH CHARGED A FEE ON

00:58:05.215 --> 00:58:06.983
INTERSTATE VOICE CALLS ON AS

00:58:07.050 --> 00:58:08.685
MANY OF YOU KNOW AS MORE PEOPLE

00:58:08.751 --> 00:58:09.819
SHIFT FROM VOICE CALLS TO

00:58:09.886 --> 00:58:11.087
TEXTING AND OTHER FORMS OF

00:58:11.154 --> 00:58:12.689
COMMUNICATION.

00:58:12.755 --> 00:58:14.123
THE FEE REVENUE WAS DECLINING

00:58:14.190 --> 00:58:15.792
THREATENING OUR ABILITY TO FUND

00:58:15.859 --> 00:58:17.427
FURTHER IMPROVEMENTS FOR NINE

00:58:17.493 --> 00:58:18.995
ONE ONE SYSTEMS AT EXACTLY THE

00:58:19.062 --> 00:58:20.129
TIME WHEN WERE INCREDIBLE

00:58:20.196 --> 00:58:21.397
EXPERIENCING INCREASING

00:58:21.464 --> 00:58:23.032
WILDFIRES AND OTHER EMERGENCIES.

00:58:23.099 --> 00:58:25.068
AND PEOPLE ARE REALLY RELYING ON

00:58:25.134 --> 00:58:26.436
UPGRADES TO THAT SYSTEM BUILDING

00:58:26.502 --> 00:58:27.971
REDUNDANCIES INTO IT SO THAT

00:58:28.037 --> 00:58:30.540
WHEN PEOPLE CALL 911- EMERGENCY

00:58:30.607 --> 00:58:32.075
THAT CALL WILL BE RELIABLE AND

00:58:32.141 --> 00:58:34.244
IT WILL REACH DISPATCH QUICKLY.

00:58:34.310 --> 00:58:36.145
SO WHAT THIS TRAILER BILL DIES

00:58:36.212 --> 00:58:37.280
IT'S WHICH IS FROM AN

00:58:37.347 --> 00:58:38.581
INTERESTING VOICE COFFEE TO A

00:58:38.648 --> 00:58:41.451
FLAT FEE ON ACCESS LINES -- IT

00:58:41.517 --> 00:58:42.585
WOULD BE UNDER THIS TRAILER BILL

00:58:42.652 --> 00:58:44.821
BETWEEN ZERO AND EIGHTY CENTS WE

00:58:44.888 --> 00:58:46.356
ARE ESTIMATING FOR THE FIRST

00:58:46.422 --> 00:58:47.657
YEAR THAT THE FEE WOULD CON MAN

00:58:47.724 --> 00:58:49.125
AT THIRTY FOUR CENTS SO THAT

00:58:49.192 --> 00:58:52.195
SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF VARIABLES --

00:58:52.262 --> 00:58:53.763
I'D BUT WE BELIEVE THAT THIS FEE

00:58:53.830 --> 00:58:54.697
WILL ENABLE -- THE

00:58:54.764 --> 00:58:55.999
ADMINISTRATION THE STATE TO

00:58:56.065 --> 00:58:57.367
REPLENISH THAT ACCOUNT AND FUND

00:58:57.433 --> 00:59:00.703
THE IMPROVEMENTS THAT

00:59:00.770 --> 00:59:03.940
CALIFORNIA'S ARE COUNTING ON

00:59:04.007 --> 00:59:04.207
THANK YOU.

00:59:04.274 --> 00:59:05.775
MISTER RELATED.

00:59:05.842 --> 00:59:08.044
IF WE ESTIMATE THAT -- YES NEEDS

00:59:08.111 --> 00:59:11.614
34% SPUR LINE TO FUND NEXT GEN

00:59:11.681 --> 00:59:12.081
NINE ONE ONE WHERE WE

00:59:12.148 --> 00:59:14.517
AUTHORIZING THEM -- TO FOR A

00:59:14.584 --> 00:59:16.452
SURCHARGE OF UP TO EIGHTY CENTS.

00:59:16.519 --> 00:59:17.787
SO I THINK THE MAIN REASON IS

00:59:17.854 --> 00:59:19.589
BECAUSE THIS IS -- TRAILER BILL

00:59:19.656 --> 00:59:21.291
AND GOES IN THE STATUTE WE DO

00:59:21.357 --> 00:59:22.158
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS

00:59:22.225 --> 00:59:23.927
FLEXIBILITY BUILT AND NOT JUST

00:59:23.993 --> 00:59:25.061
FOR THIS YEAR FOR NEXT YEAR BUT

00:59:25.128 --> 00:59:26.562
FOR MANY YEARS IN THE FUTURE

00:59:26.629 --> 00:59:28.197
BECAUSE UPGRADING OUR NINE ONE

00:59:28.264 --> 00:59:29.999
ONE SYSTEM IS NOT A ONE YEAR OR

00:59:30.066 --> 00:59:30.600
TWO YEAR.

00:59:30.667 --> 00:59:32.001
I'VE AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT

00:59:32.068 --> 00:59:33.703
NEEDS TO BE DONE CONTINUALLY I

00:59:33.770 --> 00:59:35.772
WILL POINT OUT THAT AT THROUGH

00:59:35.838 --> 00:59:37.240
THE ANNUAL BUDGET ACT -- SO THIS

00:59:37.307 --> 00:59:38.875
FEE WILL RAISE MONEY FOR THAT

00:59:38.942 --> 00:59:41.210
SPECIAL FUNDS BUT HOW THAT MONEY

00:59:41.277 --> 00:59:43.479
IS SPENT IN OVERSIGHT IS A LOT

00:59:43.546 --> 00:59:44.514
UP TO THE LEGISLATURE AND THE

00:59:44.580 --> 00:59:45.381
ADMINISTRATION.

00:59:45.448 --> 00:59:47.016
SO THE BALANCE OF THAT FIND AND

00:59:47.083 --> 00:59:49.252
THE NEED TO INCREASE THE FEE --

00:59:49.319 --> 00:59:50.954
WILL ULTIMATELY DEPEND IN MANY

00:59:51.020 --> 00:59:52.155
WAYS ON HOW MUCH THE LEGISLATURE

00:59:52.221 --> 00:59:53.356
WANTS TO APPROPRIATE OUT OF THAT

00:59:53.423 --> 00:59:55.058
ACCOUNT FOR UPGRADES TO THE NINE

00:59:55.124 --> 00:59:56.459
ONE ONE SYSTEM WELL I THINK

00:59:56.526 --> 00:59:57.126
WE'RE ALL.

00:59:57.193 --> 00:59:59.862
FANS OF UPGRADING TO NEXT GEN

00:59:59.929 --> 01:00:00.463
NINE ONE ONE BUT I'M SURE I'M

01:00:00.530 --> 01:00:02.065
NOT ALONE IN OPINING THAT THE

01:00:02.131 --> 01:00:03.666
LEGISLATURE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE

01:00:03.733 --> 01:00:04.667
AN ACTIVE ROLE.

01:00:04.734 --> 01:00:07.770
IN OVERSIGHT OF THAT PROJECT AND

01:00:07.837 --> 01:00:10.406
TO AUTHORIZE A MAXIMUM CAP OF

01:00:10.473 --> 01:00:14.544
OVER TWICE WHAT'S REQUIRED SEEMS

01:00:14.610 --> 01:00:16.179
A LITTLE FOOLHARDY.

01:00:16.245 --> 01:00:17.814
LIKE TO ASK YOU SOMETHING ELSE

01:00:17.880 --> 01:00:18.348
ABOUT THAT THE WHICH IS.

01:00:18.414 --> 01:00:18.982
REALLY MY BIGGEST PROBLEM WITH

01:00:19.048 --> 01:00:19.649
THIS PARTICULAR TRAILER BILL WE

01:00:19.716 --> 01:00:20.984
HAVE A TWENTY ONE BILLION DOLLAR

01:00:21.050 --> 01:00:22.285
BUDGET SURPLUS THIS YEAR.

01:00:22.352 --> 01:00:24.420
WHY IS IT NECESSARY TO INCREASE

01:00:24.487 --> 01:00:26.155
TAXES?

01:00:26.222 --> 01:00:28.024
ON OUR CONSTITUENTS IN HERE ONE

01:00:28.091 --> 01:00:30.927
OF BUDGET SURPLUSES THAT LARGE

01:00:30.994 --> 01:00:31.494
RICHEST THE OPTICS OF IT ARE

01:00:31.561 --> 01:00:32.095
TERRIBLE.

01:00:32.161 --> 01:00:34.497
SO OUR VIEW OF THIS IS THAT WE

01:00:34.564 --> 01:00:35.832
ARE SWITCHING TO A SYSTEM THAT'S

01:00:35.898 --> 01:00:38.001
FOLLOWED BY YEAH I THINK FORTY

01:00:38.067 --> 01:00:38.634
SEVEN OTHER STATES YOU KNOW --

01:00:38.701 --> 01:00:40.203
SO WHERE WELL BEHIND THE CURVE

01:00:40.269 --> 01:00:42.338
CALIFORNIA COMPARED TO HOW WE

01:00:42.405 --> 01:00:43.272
STRUCTURE OUR NINE ONE ONE FEES

01:00:43.339 --> 01:00:44.907
SO THERE IS A NINE ONE ONE FEE

01:00:44.974 --> 01:00:46.242
IN PLACE IT'S JUST NOT

01:00:46.309 --> 01:00:47.777
ACCOMPLISHING THE PURPOSES. FOR

01:00:47.844 --> 01:00:49.746
WHICH WAS INTENDED BACK IN

01:00:49.812 --> 01:00:50.380
NINETEEN SEVENTY THREE OR WHEN

01:00:50.446 --> 01:00:51.781
WE FIRST REALLY STARTED STANDING

01:00:51.848 --> 01:00:53.316
UP THE NINE ONE ONE SYSTEM.

01:00:53.383 --> 01:00:54.951
AND WHEN IT COMES MORE BROADLY

01:00:55.018 --> 01:00:56.052
TO THE SURPLUS THAT YOU

01:00:56.119 --> 01:00:57.720
MENTIONED -- WE OF COURSE

01:00:57.787 --> 01:00:59.022
BELIEVE THAT MOST OF THAT

01:00:59.088 --> 01:01:01.524
SURPLUS AS MUCH AS ALMOST 90% IS

01:01:01.591 --> 01:01:03.292
BASED ON ONE TIME FUNDING AND

01:01:03.359 --> 01:01:05.428
BECAUSE WE'VE YOU UPGRADING THE

01:01:05.495 --> 01:01:06.429
NINE ONE ONE SYSTEM AS AN ON

01:01:06.496 --> 01:01:07.530
GOING PROJECT.

01:01:07.597 --> 01:01:08.498
WE DO BELIEVE IT NEEDS TO BE

01:01:08.564 --> 01:01:09.932
MATCHED WITH AN ONGOING SOURCE

01:01:09.999 --> 01:01:11.634
OF FUNDING WELL THEN I WOULD BE

01:01:11.701 --> 01:01:13.102
IN FAVOR OF FUNDING IT.

01:01:13.169 --> 01:01:15.071
THIS YEAR OUT OF OUR RESERVE OUT

01:01:15.138 --> 01:01:16.706
OF OUR A SURPLUS IN IN FUTURE

01:01:16.773 --> 01:01:17.673
YEARS IF WE DIDN'T HAVE THE

01:01:17.740 --> 01:01:19.409
MONEY TO FUND IT THEN GOING TO

01:01:19.475 --> 01:01:20.343
CALIFORNIANS.

01:01:20.410 --> 01:01:21.344
AND ASKING THEM TO FUNDED

01:01:21.411 --> 01:01:22.845
BECAUSE ASKING THEM TO FUNDED

01:01:22.912 --> 01:01:23.346
NOW.

01:01:23.413 --> 01:01:24.814
IN A YEAR WHEN WE HAVE SUCH A

01:01:24.881 --> 01:01:26.549
LARGE SURPLUS I THINK IS

01:01:26.616 --> 01:01:27.083
UNCONSCIONABLE.

01:01:27.150 --> 01:01:28.351
I WILL MAKE ONE FINAL POINT

01:01:28.418 --> 01:01:30.219
WHICH IS THAT THIS FEE I BELIEVE

01:01:30.286 --> 01:01:33.156
GOES INTO EFFECT ON JANUARY --

01:01:33.222 --> 01:01:34.257
TWENTY TWENTY OF TWENTY TWENTY

01:01:34.323 --> 01:01:35.758
SO FOR THESE LAST SIX MONTHS --

01:01:35.825 --> 01:01:37.493
IT DOES NCLUDE A GENERAL FUND

01:01:37.560 --> 01:01:40.096
APPROPRIATION AS THE NEW FEE

01:01:40.163 --> 01:01:40.730
STRUCTURE IS BEING SETTING UP

01:01:40.797 --> 01:01:42.498
MOBILE WE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY WE

01:01:42.565 --> 01:01:43.366
COULD EASILY FUNDED IT NEXT YEAR.

01:01:43.433 --> 01:01:48.671
AND COME BACK THE YEAR AFTER

01:01:48.738 --> 01:01:49.305
THAT IF WE DIDN'T HAVE A SURPLUS

01:01:49.372 --> 01:01:51.841
ANYMORE [inaudible]

01:01:51.908 --> 01:01:54.177
THIS REVIEW.

01:01:54.243 --> 01:01:55.011
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- WITH A

01:01:55.078 --> 01:01:55.645
FOLLOW UP QUESTION ON THAT HOW

01:01:55.711 --> 01:01:56.946
MUCH DO WE EXPECT TO RAISE WITH

01:01:57.013 --> 01:01:59.816
THE THIRTY FIVE CENTS -- THE

01:01:59.882 --> 01:02:02.185
FIRST FIVE YEARS.

01:02:02.251 --> 01:02:05.154
AND SO IT THIRTY FOUR CENTS --

01:02:05.221 --> 01:02:06.823
WE AND ON A FULL YEAR IS IT

01:02:06.889 --> 01:02:08.491
MISTER MISS MISS ONE OFTEN YEAH

01:02:08.558 --> 01:02:09.092
I JUST POINTED OUT THAT -- IT

01:02:09.158 --> 01:02:11.160
GOES INTO EFFECT JAN FIRST.

01:02:11.227 --> 01:02:12.495
TWENTY TWENTY SO THE TWO

01:02:12.562 --> 01:02:13.129
THOUSAND NINETEEN TWENTY BUDGET

01:02:13.196 --> 01:02:14.664
IS ONLY ASSUMING SIX MONTHS AT

01:02:14.730 --> 01:02:16.466
THAT RATE BUT A FULL YEAR AT

01:02:16.532 --> 01:02:19.368
THAT RATE WOULD RAISE ABOUT A

01:02:19.435 --> 01:02:20.002
HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE MILLION

01:02:20.069 --> 01:02:20.837
DOLLARS.

01:02:20.903 --> 01:02:22.572
OKAY SO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE

01:02:22.638 --> 01:02:24.474
MILLION SO -- THE ADDITIONAL

01:02:24.540 --> 01:02:25.708
FIVE CENTS WOULD NOT BE A BEGIN

01:02:25.775 --> 01:02:27.009
IF WE DID ONLY FORTY CENTS

01:02:27.076 --> 01:02:28.578
INSTEAD OF EIGHTY CENTS TO FIVE

01:02:28.644 --> 01:02:29.245
CENTS WOULD NOT BE A BIG ENOUGH

01:02:29.312 --> 01:02:30.079
CUSHION.

01:02:30.146 --> 01:02:31.781
IS WHAT YOU'RE SAYING THAT'S

01:02:31.848 --> 01:02:32.915
WHAT WE NEED THE EIGHTY CENTS.

01:02:32.982 --> 01:02:34.684
SO THE WAY THAT THE THE TRAILER

01:02:34.750 --> 01:02:37.053
BILL IS SET UP IS THERE'S A VERY --

01:02:37.120 --> 01:02:39.989
TYPE PARAMETER CALCULATION ON

01:02:40.056 --> 01:02:41.757
HOW THE FEE IS SET. TO THE CAP

01:02:41.824 --> 01:02:45.561
UP TO EIGHTY CENTS BUT YES HAS.

01:02:45.628 --> 01:02:47.630
VERY MINIMAL -- CONTROL OVER HOW

01:02:47.697 --> 01:02:49.265
THAT ACTUALLY IS CALCULATED SO

01:02:49.332 --> 01:02:51.667
THE WAY THAT IT WORKS IS.

01:02:51.734 --> 01:02:53.336
THE FUND BALANCE IN SET NOW IS

01:02:53.402 --> 01:02:54.570
TAKE INTO ACCOUNT.

01:02:54.637 --> 01:02:55.438
AND THEN THE LEGISLATURE'S

01:02:55.505 --> 01:02:58.508
ANNUAL AMOUNT OF PREPARATION

01:02:58.574 --> 01:02:59.008
FROM SET NOW.

01:02:59.075 --> 01:02:59.609
AND THEN THE TOTAL NUMBER OF

01:02:59.675 --> 01:03:01.110
ACCESS LINES THAT ARE REPORTED

01:03:01.177 --> 01:03:03.946
BY SERVICE PROVIDERS -- TO YES.

01:03:04.013 --> 01:03:05.448
SO THERE'S NOT REALLY A

01:03:05.515 --> 01:03:07.550
DISCRETIONARY PIECE ON YES IS

01:03:07.617 --> 01:03:09.018
PART IN HOW THAT FEE IS

01:03:09.085 --> 01:03:10.086
CALCULATED.

01:03:10.153 --> 01:03:11.187
ONCE THE LEGISLATURE MAKES A

01:03:11.254 --> 01:03:12.922
DETERMINATION ON HOW MUCH THE

01:03:12.989 --> 01:03:14.490
PERFORATED FROM SET NOW.

01:03:14.557 --> 01:03:15.491
THEY WILL ESSENTIALLY DIVIDE

01:03:15.558 --> 01:03:17.093
THAT AMOUNT BY THE NUMBER OF

01:03:17.160 --> 01:03:18.728
ACCESS LINES AND THAT'S WHAT

01:03:18.794 --> 01:03:20.897
DETERMINES WHAT THE FEE WILL BE

01:03:20.963 --> 01:03:22.698
FOR THAT FOR THE UPCOMING FISH

01:03:22.765 --> 01:03:24.967
CARRIER RIGHT THANK YOU -- BUT

01:03:25.034 --> 01:03:26.235
YOU KNOW EARLIER IN THE A

01:03:26.302 --> 01:03:27.236
PREVIOUS TRAILER BILLS WE TALKED

01:03:27.303 --> 01:03:29.472
ABOUT THE THE RESERVES THAT 3%

01:03:29.539 --> 01:03:31.707
RESERVES VERSUS THE 1% AND AND

01:03:31.774 --> 01:03:32.542
THE STATEMENT WAS YOU KNOW WE

01:03:32.608 --> 01:03:33.543
WANT TO CAPITA WE DON'T WANT TO

01:03:33.609 --> 01:03:35.178
HAVE TOO MUCH OR NOT ENOUGH.

01:03:35.244 --> 01:03:36.812
AND SO IN MY OPINION THE YOU

01:03:36.879 --> 01:03:39.815
KNOW HAVING THEIR A FEET UP TO

01:03:39.882 --> 01:03:42.185
EIGHTY CENTS -- SEEMS LIKE OVER

01:03:42.251 --> 01:03:45.154
50% OF WHAT WE ACTUALLY NEED AND

01:03:45.221 --> 01:03:48.124
SO -- I'M JUST CONCERNED THAT

01:03:48.191 --> 01:03:49.659
WE'RE LEAVING IT THAT BIG OF A

01:03:49.725 --> 01:03:51.427
CUSHION OPEN AND I WOULD FEEL

01:03:51.494 --> 01:03:52.995
COMFORTABLE WITH THE FORTY CENTS.

01:03:53.062 --> 01:03:54.497
GIVING US THE FIVE CENT QUESTION

01:03:54.564 --> 01:03:56.199
AS OPPOSED TO FIFTY FIVE CENT

01:03:56.265 --> 01:03:57.767
CUSHION AND THAT'S BASICALLY

01:03:57.833 --> 01:03:58.167
JUST.

01:03:58.234 --> 01:04:00.636
MY OPINION -- BUT OBVIOUSLY YOU

01:04:00.703 --> 01:04:02.138
KNOW WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE TRYING TO

01:04:02.205 --> 01:04:03.406
UPGRADE THE SYSTEM AND I THINK

01:04:03.472 --> 01:04:04.640
WE'RE ALL IN FAVOR OF THAT IT'S

01:04:04.707 --> 01:04:05.174
JUST.

01:04:05.241 --> 01:04:06.542
YOU KNOW HAVING THE QUOTE ON

01:04:06.609 --> 01:04:09.378
QUOTE FLEXIBILITY UP TO EIGHTY

01:04:09.445 --> 01:04:11.347
CENTS IS KIND OF AS A CONSUMER

01:04:11.414 --> 01:04:12.848
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT I

01:04:12.915 --> 01:04:14.617
KNOW IT'S ONLY EIGHTY CENTS WE

01:04:14.684 --> 01:04:15.818
OXY IT WOULD ONLY EIGHTY CENTS

01:04:15.885 --> 01:04:17.954
BUT A LOT OF OUR POPULATION AND

01:04:18.020 --> 01:04:18.554
EIGHTY CENTS COULD.

01:04:18.621 --> 01:04:19.055
YOU KNOW.

01:04:19.121 --> 01:04:25.995
IF YOU HAVE THREE OR FOUR LINES --

01:04:26.062 --> 01:04:27.964
KANNADA UP.

01:04:28.030 --> 01:04:29.131
QUICKLY AND I THINK THAT'S WHY

01:04:29.198 --> 01:04:29.932
MOST THE DISCRETION IN HOW THEY

01:04:29.999 --> 01:04:30.967
GET SAID IS ACTUALLY LEFT TO THE

01:04:31.033 --> 01:04:32.435
LEGISLATURE WHEN IT DETERMINES

01:04:32.501 --> 01:04:33.035
HOW MUCH APPROPRIATE FROM THE

01:04:33.102 --> 01:04:33.236
FUND.

01:04:33.302 --> 01:04:34.470
SO IT IS GOING TO BE AN

01:04:34.537 --> 01:04:35.037
OVERSIGHT BY THE LEGISLATURE

01:04:35.104 --> 01:04:35.605
EXACTLY LEGISLATURE IN THE

01:04:35.671 --> 01:04:36.272
BUDGET EVERY YEAR WILL DETERMINE

01:04:36.339 --> 01:04:36.872
THE AMOUNT OF CORPORATE FROM

01:04:36.939 --> 01:04:38.241
THAT FUND AND THAT IS THE

01:04:38.307 --> 01:04:40.476
LARGEST DETERMINANT IN WITH A

01:04:40.543 --> 01:04:43.379
FEW GET SET AT THANK YOU.

01:04:43.446 --> 01:04:44.480
THANK YOU DOCTOR WHAT.

01:04:44.547 --> 01:04:45.514
YES THANK YOU SO SO IS THERE AN

01:04:45.581 --> 01:04:47.783
ANNUAL REPORT ON THIS OR IS THIS

01:04:47.850 --> 01:04:49.018
JUST WE ASK FOR THE INFORMATION

01:04:49.085 --> 01:04:52.188
AND THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS.

01:04:52.255 --> 01:04:52.855
HAS TO THE FUN CONDITION

01:04:52.922 --> 01:04:54.156
STATEMENT THAT'S PUBLISHED IN

01:04:54.223 --> 01:04:55.324
THE BUDGET EVERY YEAR WOULD

01:04:55.391 --> 01:04:57.526
INDICATE WHAT THE EXPENDITURE

01:04:57.593 --> 01:05:00.630
AND REVENUE ASSUMPTIONS ARE AND

01:05:00.696 --> 01:05:02.865
AND THAT WOULD YEAH WE OKAY

01:05:02.932 --> 01:05:03.866
STATEMENT DOESN'T A SELFLESS THE

01:05:03.933 --> 01:05:05.301
FEVER IT LISTS ALL THE

01:05:05.368 --> 01:05:07.603
INFORMATION THAT USED TO

01:05:07.670 --> 01:05:08.204
CATHOLIC THE FEES WE CAN VERY

01:05:08.271 --> 01:05:08.504
EASILY GIVE.

01:05:08.571 --> 01:05:09.705
YOU THAT.

01:05:09.772 --> 01:05:11.007
NOTE THE FOLLOW UP QUESTION --

01:05:11.073 --> 01:05:11.807
SO I REPRESENT A LARGELY RURAL

01:05:11.874 --> 01:05:13.142
AREA AND WITH INCREASED RELIANCE

01:05:13.209 --> 01:05:16.145
ON SO TECHNOLOGY -- THAT BECOMES

01:05:16.212 --> 01:05:17.179
PROBLEMATIC FOR A LOT OF OUR

01:05:17.246 --> 01:05:20.383
CONSTITUENTS IN THE FIRES IN TWO

01:05:20.449 --> 01:05:21.350
THOUSAND AND SEVENTEEN WE

01:05:21.417 --> 01:05:22.551
ACTUALLY HAD AN ENTIRE.

01:05:22.618 --> 01:05:24.587
AREA I WOULD GO OUT BECAUSE OF

01:05:24.654 --> 01:05:26.689
THE INABILITY TO COMMUNICATE SO

01:05:26.756 --> 01:05:28.291
WITH SOME OF THIS MONEY THEN.

01:05:28.357 --> 01:05:29.358
GOING FOR ADDITIONAL

01:05:29.425 --> 01:05:32.228
INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WILL HELP.

01:05:32.295 --> 01:05:33.529
IN THESE HARD TO REACH CELLULAR

01:05:33.596 --> 01:05:36.198
AREAS WHEN PEOPLE NEED TO REACH

01:05:36.265 --> 01:05:37.066
NINE ONE ONE DURING EMERGENCIES

01:05:37.133 --> 01:05:39.135
AND IS THAT IS THAT PART OF THE

01:05:39.201 --> 01:05:40.870
PURPOSE OF THIS BECAUSE I WILL

01:05:40.936 --> 01:05:43.205
TAKE IN IN ABOUT 4250% OF MY

01:05:43.272 --> 01:05:44.707
DISTRICT SOMETIMES THERE'S

01:05:44.774 --> 01:05:46.375
THERE'S NO CELL COVERAGE AT ALL.

01:05:46.442 --> 01:05:48.711
SO -- DURING AN EMERGENCY IN

01:05:48.778 --> 01:05:49.812
YOUR TRYING TO TRACK PEOPLE DOWN

01:05:49.879 --> 01:05:51.347
FOR THEY ARE TRYING TO TRACK

01:05:51.414 --> 01:05:53.783
PEOPLE DOWN IT'S REALLY

01:05:53.849 --> 01:05:55.851
DIFFICULT -- AUTOMOBILE

01:05:55.918 --> 01:05:58.487
ACCIDENTS -- CUT OFF BECAUSE OF

01:05:58.554 --> 01:06:00.256
LANDSLIDES THESE ARE THINGS THAT

01:06:00.323 --> 01:06:01.857
HAPPEN EVERY YEAR IN MY

01:06:01.924 --> 01:06:03.326
DISTRICTS SO.

01:06:03.392 --> 01:06:05.361
SO ARE WE ARE WE WORKING ON THE

01:06:05.428 --> 01:06:11.434
INFRASTRUCTURE -- AS WELL OR IS

01:06:11.500 --> 01:06:11.967
THIS JUST TO MAINTAIN THE

01:06:12.034 --> 01:06:14.570
CURRENT.

01:06:14.637 --> 01:06:17.306
HELLO STATUS QUO SO THE FUNDING

01:06:17.373 --> 01:06:18.374
THAT WILL BE.

01:06:18.441 --> 01:06:19.975
AND THEN THE NEXT GENERALIZED.

01:06:20.042 --> 01:06:21.677
PROGRAM DOES BUILDING NEW

01:06:21.744 --> 01:06:22.778
TECHNOLOGY FOR HOW THE NINE ONE

01:06:22.845 --> 01:06:25.181
SYSTEM WORKS IT DOESN'T INCLUDE

01:06:25.247 --> 01:06:26.382
ME UP WHEN I CAN BE FUNDING LIKE

01:06:26.449 --> 01:06:27.583
NEW CELL TOWERS AND THINGS LIKE

01:06:27.650 --> 01:06:29.418
THAT SO IN TERMS OF LIKE.

01:06:29.485 --> 01:06:31.487
CELL COVERAGE.

01:06:31.554 --> 01:06:32.254
THIS DOESN'T IT YOU KNOW

01:06:32.321 --> 01:06:34.390
SPECIFICALLY ADDRESS THAT BUT IT

01:06:34.457 --> 01:06:35.558
IS HELPING TO ADDRESS.

01:06:35.624 --> 01:06:38.361
THE RELIABILITY OF THE NINE ONE

01:06:38.427 --> 01:06:39.795
ONE SYSTEM ITSELF SO THAT LIKE

01:06:39.862 --> 01:06:41.097
FOR EXAMPLE RIGHT NOW IN A MAJOR

01:06:41.163 --> 01:06:42.631
INCIDENT THERE ARE TIMES WHEN

01:06:42.698 --> 01:06:44.333
DISPATCH CENTERS GET OVERWHELMED

01:06:44.400 --> 01:06:46.635
CALLS GO UNANSWERED -- OR THEY

01:06:46.702 --> 01:06:48.804
GET ANSWERED YOU KNOW IN WELL

01:06:48.871 --> 01:06:51.173
OVER THREE SECONDS WHICH IS THE

01:06:51.240 --> 01:06:51.907
THE KIND OF THE TARGET.

01:06:51.974 --> 01:06:53.075
THE BIG FOCUS OF THIS IS TO MAKE

01:06:53.142 --> 01:06:54.276
SURE THAT WE DON'T HAVE NINE ONE

01:06:54.343 --> 01:06:56.212
ONE CALLS GOING ON ANSWERED THAT

01:06:56.278 --> 01:06:56.846
ALL NINE ONE CALLS GET ANSWERED

01:06:56.912 --> 01:06:57.847
QUICKLY.

01:06:57.913 --> 01:06:59.482
IF A DISPATCH CENTER HAS TO BE

01:06:59.548 --> 01:07:01.117
EVACUATED BECAUSE OF AN INCIDENT

01:07:01.183 --> 01:07:02.351
THOSE CALLS CAN BE READ

01:07:02.418 --> 01:07:03.986
REDIRECTED TO A NEIGHBORING

01:07:04.053 --> 01:07:05.654
CLOSE DISPATCH CENTER SO THAT

01:07:05.721 --> 01:07:07.156
THE CALL STILL GET ANSWERED

01:07:07.223 --> 01:07:10.226
PEOPLE STILL GET -- DIRECTION IT

01:07:10.292 --> 01:07:11.961
ALSO.

01:07:12.027 --> 01:07:13.195
PROVIDE SOME -- OVERTON WARNING

01:07:13.262 --> 01:07:15.231
COMPONENTS SO THAT YOU CAN HAVE

01:07:15.297 --> 01:07:17.700
WHICH IS KIND OF REVERSED NINE

01:07:17.767 --> 01:07:18.601
ONE IF YOU WILL WHERE THEY'LL

01:07:18.667 --> 01:07:19.835
HAVE THE ABILITY TO KIND OF PUSH

01:07:19.902 --> 01:07:21.971
INFORMATION OUT TO NINE ONE ONE

01:07:22.037 --> 01:07:24.774
FOLKS SO I RATHER THAN THIRTY

01:07:24.840 --> 01:07:26.509
PEOPLE CALL IN -- TO REPORT THE

01:07:26.575 --> 01:07:27.676
SAME INCIDENT YOU KNOW SOME

01:07:27.743 --> 01:07:29.111
POINT I BELIEVE THE HAVE THE

01:07:29.178 --> 01:07:30.279
CAPABILITY.

01:07:30.346 --> 01:07:31.514
TO RECEIVE REPORTS NAME PUSH OUT

01:07:31.580 --> 01:07:33.682
INFORMATION TO THE FOLKS IN THE

01:07:33.749 --> 01:07:35.184
AFFECTED AREA.

01:07:35.251 --> 01:07:36.485
BASED ON CELL COVERAGE THINGS

01:07:36.552 --> 01:07:38.020
LIKE THAT SO THAT'S REALLY THE

01:07:38.087 --> 01:07:40.423
KIND OF THE FOCUS INCIDENTS.

01:07:40.489 --> 01:07:43.325

THANK YOU IT AND FOLLOWING UP ON

01:07:46.629 --> 01:07:47.430
THE ON THAT DISCUSSION -- AND

01:07:47.496 --> 01:07:48.864
SOMEBODY OF COUNTY WE DO HAVE A

01:07:48.931 --> 01:07:49.432
LOT OF REMOTE AREAS THAT ARE

01:07:49.498 --> 01:07:49.665
THERE.

01:07:49.732 --> 01:07:51.133
AND HOPEFULLY -- LOOKING AT THIS

01:07:51.200 --> 01:07:52.268
IN HERE IN THE DISCUSSION --

01:07:52.334 --> 01:07:54.036
PREVIOUSLY FROM ASSEMBLYMEMBER

01:07:54.103 --> 01:07:54.904
WHAT'S QUESTION.

01:07:54.970 --> 01:08:00.643
THE NEXT THE RECEPTION BETTER IN

01:08:00.709 --> 01:08:02.044
THE REMOTE AREAS THAT ARE THERE

01:08:02.111 --> 01:08:03.179
THAT WE CAN SAY THAT WE'RE

01:08:03.245 --> 01:08:04.447
EXPANDING.

01:08:04.513 --> 01:08:05.614
THAT AREA AND WITH THE

01:08:05.681 --> 01:08:07.149
INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE SCENE THE

01:08:07.216 --> 01:08:08.818
THINGS THAT ARE GOING ON IN THE

01:08:08.884 --> 01:08:09.919
REMOTE AREAS IN THE STATE OF

01:08:09.985 --> 01:08:12.154
CALIFORNIA AND TAKING TO IT.

01:08:12.221 --> 01:08:13.722
IN ACCOUNT THIS WHOLE STATE IN

01:08:13.789 --> 01:08:15.291
THE GEOGRAPHICAL LOCATIONS IT

01:08:15.357 --> 01:08:16.792
WILL MOVE FOR WITH THE NINE ONE

01:08:16.859 --> 01:08:17.526
SYSTEM.

01:08:17.593 --> 01:08:19.895
AND THE CAP OF EIGHTY CENTS.

01:08:19.962 --> 01:08:21.263
SO TO THE EXTENT THAT THE

01:08:21.330 --> 01:08:23.766
COVERAGE ISSUES ARE BECAUSE OF A

01:08:23.833 --> 01:08:25.835
CELL TOWER COVERAGE THIS ISN'T

01:08:25.901 --> 01:08:27.336
GOING TO ADDRESS THAT SO FOR

01:08:27.403 --> 01:08:29.104
EXAMPLE YOU KNOW IF VERIZON OR

01:08:29.171 --> 01:08:30.473
EIGHTEEN TO YOU WHOEVER YOU KNOW

01:08:30.539 --> 01:08:31.841
THAT SERVICE PROVIDER IS.

01:08:31.907 --> 01:08:33.142
DOESN'T HAVE COVERAGE IN A

01:08:33.209 --> 01:08:34.543
PARTICULAR AREA.

01:08:34.610 --> 01:08:35.811
THIS ISN'T GOING TO BUILD CELL

01:08:35.878 --> 01:08:37.580
TOWERS PROVIDE THAT KIND OF

01:08:37.646 --> 01:08:39.215
COVERAGE THIS IS GOING -- TO

01:08:39.281 --> 01:08:40.616
ENHANCE AND IMPROVE THE

01:08:40.683 --> 01:08:41.984
INFRASTRUCTURE THE STATE FIRST

01:08:42.051 --> 01:08:45.187
RESPONDERS USE -- ON THE NINE

01:08:45.254 --> 01:08:46.088
ONE ONE AND AND THEIR ABILITY TO

01:08:46.155 --> 01:08:47.556
RECEIVE CALLS BUT I WILL MAKE

01:08:47.623 --> 01:08:49.792
THE ADDITIONAL POINTS SO -- MY

01:08:49.859 --> 01:08:51.360
COLLEAGUES RIGHT IT'S NOT A WE

01:08:51.427 --> 01:08:52.862
CAN'T EXPAND CULTURALLY NOT

01:08:52.928 --> 01:08:54.063
CENTER THE PURVIEW OF THAT CELL

01:08:54.129 --> 01:08:54.997
PHONE PROVIDER COMPANIES

01:08:55.064 --> 01:08:56.599
THEMSELVES -- BUT FOR PEOPLE IN

01:08:56.665 --> 01:08:58.167
RURAL AREAS WERE ESPECIALLY

01:08:58.234 --> 01:08:59.335
DEPENDENT BECAUSE THEY MIGHT NOT

01:08:59.401 --> 01:09:00.803
BE NEAR A MEDICAL FACILITY OR

01:09:00.870 --> 01:09:03.305
NEAR AN EVACUATION CENTER.

01:09:03.372 --> 01:09:06.175
THEY ARE IN SOME WAYS RELYING ON

01:09:06.242 --> 01:09:06.809
NINE ONE ONE BEING ABLE TO GET

01:09:06.876 --> 01:09:08.110
THROUGH IF THEY DO HAVE COVERAGE

01:09:25.494 --> 01:09:27.363
INFRASTRUCTURAL ASPECT OF THE

THIS TRANSITION AND THIS FEE.

01:09:45.347 --> 01:09:46.582
IT SEEMS AS IF AS WE AS

01:09:46.649 --> 01:09:48.551

TO THAT A LITTLE BIT.

01:09:55.658 --> 01:09:56.725
SURE YEAH THE EXISTING FEE

01:09:56.792 --> 01:09:59.662

BETTER UNDERSTAND -- IT'S IT'S

01:14:11.079 --> 01:14:13.215
CLEAR THAT THERE ARE DISTRICTS

01:14:13.282 --> 01:14:15.317
ARE IN VERY DIFFERENT PLACES

01:14:15.384 --> 01:14:17.920
WHEN IT COMES -- TO CULTIVATION

01:14:17.986 --> 01:14:19.788
LIGHT MANUFACTURING AND SALE --

01:14:19.855 --> 01:14:22.658

35% OF THE ENTIRE STATES

01:14:27.362 --> 01:14:29.698
CULTIVATION AND WE HAVE LEARNED

01:14:29.765 --> 01:14:31.667
A LOT ABOUT WHAT SOME OF THESE

IS SPECIFICALLY RELATED -- TO

01:14:37.406 --> 01:14:39.441
THE SEQUEL EXEMPTION ON THE FACT

01:14:39.508 --> 01:14:41.143

01:14:49.051 --> 01:14:50.552
MANUFACTURING OR DESPITE OUR OUR

01:14:50.619 --> 01:14:52.020
SALES BUT I WILL SPEAK TO

01:14:52.087 --> 01:14:55.557
CULTIVATION WHEN WE ARE LEARNING

01:14:55.624 --> 01:14:57.259
THAT THERE ARE AT AND REALLY

01:14:57.326 --> 01:14:58.327

SPECIFICALLY -- IN MY DISTRICT

01:15:00.495 --> 01:15:02.598
AROUND AGRICULTURE -- THAT THOSE

01:15:02.664 --> 01:15:03.866
PUBLIC ENVIRONMENTS REVIEW

01:15:03.932 --> 01:15:05.300

01:15:05.367 --> 01:15:08.804
UNDERSTAND WHAT WE'VE LEARNED IS

01:15:08.871 --> 01:15:10.239
THAT -- WELL NOT ALL

01:15:10.305 --> 01:15:12.207
AGRICULTURAL COUGH CROPS AND

01:15:12.274 --> 01:15:13.709
MISSION THE SAME WAY AND SO

01:15:13.775 --> 01:15:15.410
WE'VE HAD A NUMBER OF EXAMPLES

01:15:15.477 --> 01:15:17.179
COME UP -- I WOULD SAY OVER THE

01:15:17.246 --> 01:15:18.380
LAST TWENTY FOUR HOURS THERE'S

01:15:18.447 --> 01:15:19.781
BEEN A NUMBER OF JOURNALISTIC

01:15:19.848 --> 01:15:22.551
PIECES THAT DESCRIBES SOME OF

01:15:22.618 --> 01:15:24.753
THE CHALLENGES -- THAT WE HAVE A

01:15:24.820 --> 01:15:26.755
IN CULTIVATION AND THEY ALSO

01:15:26.822 --> 01:15:29.191
KNOW THAT THERE HAVE BEEN ABUSES

01:15:29.258 --> 01:15:30.893
IN THE LICENSING PROCESS.

01:15:30.959 --> 01:15:36.031
AND SO I AM TRYING TO UNDERSTAND

01:15:36.098 --> 01:15:37.599
WHAT PROTECTIONS ARE IN PLACE

01:15:37.666 --> 01:15:38.166
FOR LOCAL MUNICIPALITIES TO

01:15:38.233 --> 01:15:40.869
ENSURE THAT ONE WE MEET THAT

01:15:40.936 --> 01:15:42.104
DESIRE AND THE WILL OF THE

01:15:42.170 --> 01:15:42.604
PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF

01:15:42.671 --> 01:15:43.605
CALIFORNIA.

01:15:43.672 --> 01:15:45.807
BUT TO THAT WE ALSO PROTECT ALL

01:15:45.874 --> 01:15:48.043
OTHER ECONOMIC ENGINES FOR OUR

01:15:48.110 --> 01:15:49.845
COUNTY IN PARTICULAR WITH ADD

01:15:49.912 --> 01:15:52.014
PESTICIDES DON'T MIX -- THE

01:15:52.080 --> 01:15:54.216
SPACE BETWEEN CROPS ON THE

01:15:54.283 --> 01:15:56.218
MATTERS TECHNOLOGY THAT WE HAVE

01:15:56.285 --> 01:15:57.686
IN PLACE RELATED TO ORDER OKAY

01:15:57.753 --> 01:15:59.221
HAS BEEN FOR OTHER CROPS AND NOT

01:15:59.288 --> 01:16:00.622
NECESSARILY CANNABIS TO THINGS

01:16:00.689 --> 01:16:02.557
ARE NOT NECESSARILY WORKING.

01:16:02.624 --> 01:16:03.759
IN THE WAY THEY HAVE SO I'M

01:16:03.825 --> 01:16:05.027
HOPING THAT YOU CAN SPEAK TO

01:16:05.093 --> 01:16:07.129
THAT AND WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO

01:16:07.195 --> 01:16:08.430
TO ENSURE THAT LOCAL

01:16:08.497 --> 01:16:09.898
MUNICIPALITIES HAVE THE

01:16:09.965 --> 01:16:11.934
RESOURCES FOR ENFORCEMENT THE

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:15.137
RESOURCES ALSO TO DEAL -- WITH --

01:16:15.203 --> 01:16:17.039
THESE ISSUES THAT ARE QUICKLY

01:16:17.105 --> 01:16:19.441
ARISING PARTICULARLY IN LIGHT

01:16:19.508 --> 01:16:21.043
THAT THE SEQUENCE EMPTION AND

01:16:21.109 --> 01:16:23.078
THE PERFECT -- TEMPORARY PERMITS

01:16:23.145 --> 01:16:25.514
GO THROUGH TWENTY TWENTY FIVE SO

01:16:25.580 --> 01:16:27.716
FROM MY LOOK IF IN TWELVE MONTHS

01:16:27.783 --> 01:16:29.685
WE'VE LEARNED THIS MUCH I JUST

01:16:29.751 --> 01:16:31.320
WONDER AM IF EXTENDING IT

01:16:31.386 --> 01:16:33.588
ANOTHER SIX YEARS -- WITHOUT A

01:16:33.655 --> 01:16:36.124
PUBLIC -- PROCESSES -- TO TO

01:16:36.191 --> 01:16:37.859
REVIEW THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS

01:16:37.926 --> 01:16:38.961
WHAT ELSE ARE WE GONNA LEARN AND

01:16:39.027 --> 01:16:40.762
WHAT KINDS OF HARDSHIPS ARE WE

01:16:40.829 --> 01:16:42.664
PLACING ON MUNICIPALITIES WHO

01:16:42.731 --> 01:16:43.465
HAVE.

01:16:43.532 --> 01:16:44.766
FOLLOWED THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE

01:16:44.833 --> 01:16:48.603
ON IN OUR EXCEEDING I THINK THE

01:16:48.670 --> 01:16:51.173
EXPECTATION.

01:16:51.239 --> 01:16:51.773
SO I THINK THAT THERE'S A FEW

01:16:51.840 --> 01:16:53.342
IMPORTANT POINTS THAT REALLY

01:16:53.408 --> 01:16:55.377
THAT INTENTION HERE BEHIND THAT

01:16:55.444 --> 01:16:57.145
PROVISIONAL LICENSE AUTHORITY IS

01:16:57.212 --> 01:16:59.881
TO BE USED AS A STEP UP LICENSE.

01:16:59.948 --> 01:17:01.249
AND REALIZING THAT WERE IN A

01:17:01.316 --> 01:17:03.952
MARKET THAT'S IN TRANSITION --

01:17:04.019 --> 01:17:05.454
IT'S STRUCTURED IN A WAY WHERE

01:17:05.520 --> 01:17:08.290
IS -- AS IT RELATES TO SEE WHEN

01:17:08.357 --> 01:17:10.292
FOR EXAMPLE THAT IF IT'S NOT

01:17:10.359 --> 01:17:10.926
COMPLETE THAT NEEDS TO BE UNDER

01:17:10.993 --> 01:17:11.893
WAY.

01:17:11.960 --> 01:17:12.928
IT ALLOWS THE LICENSING

01:17:12.995 --> 01:17:14.896
AUTHORITIES TO REVOKE OR SUSPEND

01:17:14.963 --> 01:17:16.565
SOMEONE'S LICENSE IF THEY'RE NOT

01:17:16.631 --> 01:17:19.334
ACTIVELY AND DILIGENTLY PURSUING --

01:17:19.401 --> 01:17:21.036
ANYA LICENSURE WHICH WOULD BE

01:17:21.103 --> 01:17:22.471
COMPLETION OF SEA QUEST -- BUT

01:17:22.537 --> 01:17:23.939
THIS IS PROVIDING FLEXIBILITY

01:17:24.006 --> 01:17:25.574
THAT RELIES DEFINITELY ON THE

01:17:25.640 --> 01:17:27.242
LOCAL JURISDICTIONS IN SOME WAY

01:17:27.309 --> 01:17:29.244
BECAUSE THEY ARE DEFINITELY THE

01:17:29.311 --> 01:17:31.213
KEEPERS OF THE SEQUEL PROCESS --

01:17:31.279 --> 01:17:32.848
BUT IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO NOTE

01:17:32.914 --> 01:17:34.383
THAT THIS DOESN'T REMOVE ANY

01:17:34.449 --> 01:17:36.752
LOCAL -- JURISDICTION DISCRETION

01:17:36.818 --> 01:17:39.421
SELF LOCAL JURISDICTION CHOOSES

01:17:39.488 --> 01:17:40.856
TO REQUIRE COMPLETION OF C. BUT

01:17:40.922 --> 01:17:42.991
BEFORE -- GETTING A PROVISIONAL

01:17:43.058 --> 01:17:44.459
LICENSE THAT THAT IS STILL

01:17:44.526 --> 01:17:45.727
ALLOWABLE UNDER THIS TRAILER

01:17:45.794 --> 01:17:47.662
BILL -- OR ANY OTHER LOCAL

01:17:47.729 --> 01:17:49.698
ORDINANCE THAT THEY CHOOSE -- I

01:17:49.765 --> 01:17:51.233
WOULD ALSO SAY THAT IT'S MY

01:17:51.299 --> 01:17:52.601
UNDERSTANDING THAT LOCAL

01:17:52.667 --> 01:17:54.603
GOVERNMENTS -- ARE STILL KIND OF

01:17:54.669 --> 01:17:56.204
WORKING THROUGH HOW TO

01:17:56.271 --> 01:17:57.873
INCORPORATE -- COMMERCIAL

01:17:57.939 --> 01:17:59.841
CANNABIS ACTIVITY INTO THEIR

01:17:59.908 --> 01:18:01.810
EXISTING SEQUEL PROCESS AND THAT

01:18:01.877 --> 01:18:03.111
THEY DO HAVE A LOT OF

01:18:03.178 --> 01:18:04.212
ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEWS THAT ARE

01:18:04.279 --> 01:18:05.747
ALREADY TAKING PLACE ON SOME OF

01:18:05.814 --> 01:18:06.882
THESE BUSINESS OPERATORS AS THEY

01:18:06.948 --> 01:18:08.984
WOULD ANY OTHER BECAUSE THEY ARE

01:18:09.051 --> 01:18:11.086
ALREADY DOING -- THE LEAD AGENCY

01:18:11.153 --> 01:18:12.287
AND LOOKING AT DISCRETIONARY

01:18:12.354 --> 01:18:13.989
VIEWS FOR VARIOUS PROJECTS SO I

01:18:14.056 --> 01:18:15.290
BELIEVE THAT STILL ALLOWS FOR

01:18:15.357 --> 01:18:16.792
THAT DISCUSSION SOME REVIEWS ARE

01:18:16.858 --> 01:18:19.394
TAKING PLACE -- AND ADD THAT WE

01:18:19.461 --> 01:18:21.463
AREN'T REMOVING ANY DISCRETION

01:18:21.530 --> 01:18:23.465
FROM THE LOCALS TO SORT OF

01:18:23.532 --> 01:18:29.404
REQUIRE FURTHER -- SEQUIN

01:18:29.471 --> 01:18:30.005
DILIGENCE IF THAT'S WHAT THEY

01:18:30.072 --> 01:18:30.238
PREFER.

01:18:30.305 --> 01:18:30.906
AND I APPRECIATE THAT YOU'RE NOT

01:18:30.972 --> 01:18:31.506
REMOVING DISCRETION I GUESS I

01:18:31.573 --> 01:18:32.140
JUST THE PART I DIDN'T HEAR IS

01:18:32.207 --> 01:18:33.675
WHAT PROTECTIONS ARE WE PUTTING

01:18:33.742 --> 01:18:34.509
IN PLACE FOR LOCAL

01:18:34.576 --> 01:18:36.578
MUNICIPALITIES TO DEAL WITH THE

01:18:36.645 --> 01:18:37.245
TRADE OFFS.

01:18:37.312 --> 01:18:39.748
OF WHAT IS -- NOW ISSUES BETWEEN

01:18:39.815 --> 01:18:42.184
AGRICULTURE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT

01:18:42.250 --> 01:18:44.719
AIR QUALITY -- I MEAN PESTICIDES

01:18:44.786 --> 01:18:46.988
BRAIN I HAVE A LIST ON IN

01:18:47.055 --> 01:18:48.457
ADDITIONALLY WHAT PROTECTIONS

01:18:48.523 --> 01:18:50.258
ARE YOU PUTTING IN PLACE HERE

01:18:50.325 --> 01:18:51.760
FOR LOCAL MUNICIPALITIES TO DEAL

01:18:51.827 --> 01:18:54.563
WITH THE ABUSE OF THE PROCESS.

01:18:54.629 --> 01:18:56.164
AT THE LIGHTS TEMPORARY LIKE SO

01:18:56.231 --> 01:18:57.199
WITH SO AGAIN THAT THE THE THE

01:18:57.265 --> 01:18:59.301
POWER TO REMOVE SOMEONE FROM

01:18:59.367 --> 01:19:00.735
LICENSURE STILL WITHIN THE LOCAL

01:19:00.802 --> 01:19:01.937
JURISDICTIONS POWER SO THEY MAKE

01:19:02.003 --> 01:19:03.171
A DETERMINATION THAT THOSE

01:19:03.238 --> 01:19:04.306
FACTORS.

01:19:04.372 --> 01:19:06.007
ARE CREATING -- SOME LOCAL

01:19:06.074 --> 01:19:07.075
HAZARDS THAT NEED TO BE

01:19:07.142 --> 01:19:08.743
ADDRESSED BY REMOVING LICENSURE

01:19:08.810 --> 01:19:09.811
FROM SOMEONE THEY CAN BY THE

01:19:09.878 --> 01:19:12.180
STATE AND WE CAN -- SUSPEND OR

01:19:12.247 --> 01:19:13.748
REVOKE THEIR LICENCE ENTIRELY SO

01:19:13.815 --> 01:19:16.051
THAT'S DEFINITELY A PROTECTION

01:19:16.118 --> 01:19:17.919
IT ALSO SPECIFIES AGAIN -- THAT

01:19:17.986 --> 01:19:19.287
THEY NEED TO BE -- THE

01:19:19.354 --> 01:19:20.288
INDIVIDUALS NEED TO BE WE

01:19:20.355 --> 01:19:22.424
DILIGENTLY ACTIVELY PURSUING THE

01:19:22.491 --> 01:19:23.758
COMPLETION OF THEIR ANNUAL

01:19:23.825 --> 01:19:26.027
LICENSE SO THE HOPE THERE IS

01:19:26.094 --> 01:19:27.562
OBVIOUSLY THAT IF PEOPLE ARE

01:19:27.629 --> 01:19:28.630
JUST GETTING A PROVISIONAL AND

01:19:28.697 --> 01:19:32.567
NOT DOING ANYTHING THEN THEY CAN --

01:19:32.634 --> 01:19:34.035
BASICALLY HAVE THEIR LICENSE

01:19:34.102 --> 01:19:36.171
REMOVE SO AND I THINK THE OTHER

01:19:36.238 --> 01:19:37.305
THING TO NOTE IS THAT SOME OF

01:19:37.372 --> 01:19:38.840
THE WHAT'S TAKING PLACE ON THE

01:19:38.907 --> 01:19:40.008
LOCAL LEVEL WAS DONE THROUGH THE

01:19:40.075 --> 01:19:41.576
TEMPORARY LICENSE PROCESS AND

01:19:41.643 --> 01:19:43.011
THE PHASE THAT WE'RE MOVING INTO

01:19:43.078 --> 01:19:44.513
IS NOT TEMPORARY LICENSES.

01:19:44.579 --> 01:19:46.148
IT'S PROVISIONAL ANY ANY

01:19:46.214 --> 01:19:47.215
LICENSES THEY HAVE TO PAY THEIR

01:19:47.282 --> 01:19:48.717
ANNUAL LICENSE FEE REGARDLESS OF

01:19:48.783 --> 01:19:50.018
WHAT CATEGORY THERE AND THAT THE

01:19:50.085 --> 01:19:51.286
FOLLOW ALL ANNUAL LICENSE

01:19:51.353 --> 01:19:52.454
REQUIREMENTS.

01:19:52.521 --> 01:19:53.822
THEY HAVE TO BE IN TRACK AND

01:19:53.889 --> 01:19:56.057
TRACE -- SO IT IS A DIFFERENT

01:19:56.124 --> 01:19:57.792
TYPE OF LICENSE THAT REMOVING TO

01:19:57.859 --> 01:19:59.327
IN THIS IN THIS SPACE AND SO I

01:19:59.394 --> 01:20:00.529
THINK THAT THERE ARE I

01:20:00.595 --> 01:20:01.997
SUFFICIENT PROTECTIONS THAT ARE

01:20:02.063 --> 01:20:02.931
IN PLACE.

01:20:02.998 --> 01:20:04.099
UNDER THIS NEW STRUCTURE THAT

01:20:04.166 --> 01:20:05.400
WERE WERE SORT OF ACTUALLY IN

01:20:05.467 --> 01:20:07.669
THE MIDST OF AND THAT WERE IN

01:20:07.736 --> 01:20:08.937
PLACE EVEN TWELVE MONTHS AGO.

01:20:09.004 --> 01:20:10.505
I APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS I

01:20:10.572 --> 01:20:12.407
WOULD ASK US.

01:20:12.474 --> 01:20:13.341
TO DO YOU CAN DIG DEEPER A

01:20:13.408 --> 01:20:14.676
LITTLE BIT DEEPER BECAUSE I

01:20:14.743 --> 01:20:16.411
THINK THAT WHILE THE INTENT IS

01:20:16.478 --> 01:20:18.647
THERE -- I AM NOT SURE THAT IT'S

01:20:18.713 --> 01:20:19.714
GOING TO MANIFEST ITSELF IN A

01:20:19.781 --> 01:20:21.516
WAY THAT ACTUALLY DOES

01:20:21.583 --> 01:20:23.351
EVERYTHING THAT IS INTENDED. TO

01:20:23.418 --> 01:20:25.220
DO FOR LOCAL MUNICIPALITIES I

01:20:25.287 --> 01:20:26.588
THINK AGRICULTURE IS A VERY BIG

01:20:26.655 --> 01:20:28.657
PART OF OUR STATE AND CERTAINLY

01:20:28.723 --> 01:20:30.725
CANNABIS IS PART OF IT -- BUT WE

01:20:30.792 --> 01:20:34.095
WANT ALL CROPS TO BE ABLE. TO

01:20:34.162 --> 01:20:35.030
MOVE FORWARD IN A WAY IN THE

01:20:35.096 --> 01:20:37.165
STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- THAT

01:20:37.232 --> 01:20:38.667
DOESN'T DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACT

01:20:38.733 --> 01:20:39.901
AND WE'RE LEARNING A LOT ABOUT

01:20:39.968 --> 01:20:41.736
IT AND I HOPE THAT AND AS

01:20:41.803 --> 01:20:43.572
DISCUSSIONS CONTINUE ABOUT THIS

01:20:43.638 --> 01:20:45.140
PARTICULAR ISSUE -- THAT WOULD

01:20:45.207 --> 01:20:46.408
TAKE A LITTLE BIT DEEPER THE

01:20:46.474 --> 01:20:47.709
INTENT IS THERE AND I'M NOT

01:20:47.776 --> 01:20:49.211
GOING TO ARGUE THAT BUT I DON'T

01:20:49.277 --> 01:20:50.412
SURE THAT THAT'S THE WAY THAT

01:20:50.478 --> 01:20:51.646
IT'S MANIFESTING ITSELF IN

01:20:51.713 --> 01:20:56.618
COMMUNITIES THAT ARE FOLLOWING

01:20:56.685 --> 01:20:58.253
THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE -- AND IN

01:20:58.320 --> 01:20:59.120
DOING SO TO A GREAT EXTENT THANK

01:20:59.187 --> 01:21:00.388
YOU IN JUST TWO LAST POINTS ON

01:21:00.455 --> 01:21:00.922
THIS THAT ARE ACTUAL AND

01:21:00.989 --> 01:21:01.957
ORIGINAL TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE

01:21:02.023 --> 01:21:03.191
DID NOT HAVE A SUNSET ON THE

01:21:03.258 --> 01:21:05.227
LANGUAGE SO WE HAVE AGREED TO A

01:21:05.293 --> 01:21:06.895
TWENTY TWENTY FIVE CENTS AT AND

01:21:06.962 --> 01:21:08.396
WE HAVE AGREED THAT -- TO

01:21:08.463 --> 01:21:09.397
PROVIDE ADDITIONAL

01:21:09.464 --> 01:21:10.265
ADMINISTRATIVE CLARITY ABOUT

01:21:10.332 --> 01:21:12.167
WHAT SEQUEL UNDER WAY MEANS SO

01:21:12.234 --> 01:21:13.535
WE CAN ACTUALLY MOVE PEOPLE

01:21:13.602 --> 01:21:15.203
THROUGH THAT PROCESS AND ADDRESS

01:21:15.270 --> 01:21:18.173
ANY -- ENVIRONMENTAL -- PROBLEMS

01:21:18.240 --> 01:21:19.307
THAT THEY MAY BE CREATING AND I

01:21:19.374 --> 01:21:21.543
APPRECIATE THE THE CHANGES I

01:21:21.610 --> 01:21:24.045
ALSO THINK THAT I GO BACK TO TO

01:21:24.112 --> 01:21:25.547
TO A COMMENT THEY MADE THE IN

01:21:25.614 --> 01:21:26.982
TWELVE MONTHS -- BUT WE'VE

01:21:27.048 --> 01:21:28.817
LEARNED A LOT IN THE STATE ABOUT

01:21:28.883 --> 01:21:31.620
WHAT IS NOT WORKING AND SO AS WE

01:21:31.686 --> 01:21:33.888
THINK ABOUT THE REASON -- AND

01:21:33.955 --> 01:21:35.457
THE TIMELINE FOR HOW LONG WE'RE

01:21:35.523 --> 01:21:37.092
GOING TO EXTEND THIS PROCESS

01:21:37.158 --> 01:21:38.493
WE'RE GOING TO BE LEARNING MORE

01:21:38.560 --> 01:21:40.328
SO IF WE LEARNED THIS MUCH IN

01:21:40.395 --> 01:21:41.429
TWELVE MONTHS I SUSPECT THAT

01:21:41.496 --> 01:21:42.964
WE'RE GONNA LEARN DUBLIN IN.

01:21:43.031 --> 01:21:44.733
ANOTHER TWELVE MONTHS AND SO THE

01:21:44.799 --> 01:21:46.901
LONGER WE PROJECT THAT AL ON THE

01:21:46.968 --> 01:21:48.069
MORE REAL LEARN AND I THINK WE

01:21:48.136 --> 01:21:49.838
NEED TO ALSO BE IN A POSITION TO

01:21:49.904 --> 01:21:51.706
EMPOWER OUR LOCAL MUNICIPALITIES

01:21:51.773 --> 01:21:52.841
TO DEAL WITH SOME OF THE TRADE

01:21:52.907 --> 01:21:56.411
OFFS THAT ARE COMING.

01:21:56.478 --> 01:21:59.748
WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS

01:21:59.814 --> 01:22:00.048
[inaudible]

01:22:00.115 --> 01:22:01.049
THIS REVIEW.

01:22:01.116 --> 01:22:02.450
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I WOULD

01:22:02.517 --> 01:22:03.885
LIKE TO THINK THE ADMINISTRATION --

01:22:03.952 --> 01:22:04.653
FOR BRINGING THIS PROPOSAL

01:22:04.719 --> 01:22:06.454
FORWARD THE UNDERGROUND MARKET

01:22:06.521 --> 01:22:08.757
AS WE ALL KNOW AS A HUGE PROBLEM

01:22:08.823 --> 01:22:10.392
IN CALIFORNIA I THINK THIS BILL

01:22:10.458 --> 01:22:11.926
WILL GO A LONG WAY IN ENFORCING

01:22:11.993 --> 01:22:14.362
THE LAW -- MY CONCERNS -- ARE

01:22:14.429 --> 01:22:16.965
THAT THE TAXES THAT WE WERE

01:22:17.032 --> 01:22:18.466
PROMISED WE'RE GOOD AND GOING TO

01:22:18.533 --> 01:22:19.701
BE GENERATED WITH CANNABIS ARE

01:22:19.768 --> 01:22:21.002
NOT BEING PRODUCED AND I THINK

01:22:21.069 --> 01:22:22.604
THAT THE UNDERGROUND MARKET IS A

01:22:22.671 --> 01:22:25.006
HUGE PROBLEM -- SO I JUST WOULD

01:22:25.073 --> 01:22:26.341
LIKE TO THANK THE ADMINISTRATION

01:22:26.408 --> 01:22:27.909
AND YOU KNOW I AGREE WITH MISTER

01:22:27.976 --> 01:22:29.377
MOM THAT WE NEED TO LOOK FURTHER.

01:22:29.444 --> 01:22:30.979
AS TO AS TO HOW WE'RE GOING TO

01:22:31.046 --> 01:22:32.714
ENFORCE IT -- I THINK WE'RE

01:22:32.781 --> 01:22:34.649
PIECE MILLING A LOT OF THE

01:22:34.716 --> 01:22:36.551

01:22:36.618 --> 01:22:38.420
SOME CITIES DON'T HAVE -- THE

CAPABILITIES. TO ENFORCE A LOT

01:22:40.889 --> 01:22:41.890
OF THESE ISSUES SO I THINK THAT

01:22:41.956 --> 01:22:43.058
THE STATE NEEDS TO PLAY A BIGGER

01:22:43.124 --> 01:22:44.726

01:22:46.094 --> 01:22:47.429
ADMINISTRATION FROM BRING IT

01:22:47.495 --> 01:22:49.230

01:22:49.297 --> 01:22:51.299
WE HAVE TO KEEP -- DIGGING AND

01:22:51.366 --> 01:22:53.134

01:29:01.069 --> 01:29:02.403
TO DENY THAT PERSON A LICENSE SO

01:29:02.470 --> 01:29:03.805
THIS JUST AS AN ALLOWANCE FOR

01:29:03.871 --> 01:29:05.273
THEM TO KEEP PEOPLE ON LICENSURE

01:29:05.339 --> 01:29:07.075
BECAUSE I THINK THE ALTERNATE IS

01:29:07.141 --> 01:29:08.710
THAT IF WE MAKE THE BARRIER TOO

01:29:08.776 --> 01:29:10.144
HIGH AND WE AREN'T CONSIDERED OF

01:29:10.211 --> 01:29:12.113
WHERE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS ARE

01:29:12.180 --> 01:29:14.282
ABOUT SORT OF THEIR SEQUEL

01:29:14.348 --> 01:29:15.750
PROCESS WE COULD HAVE.

01:29:15.817 --> 01:29:16.951
IT THAT WE JUST PUT UP TO BIGGER

01:29:17.018 --> 01:29:18.186
BARRIERS AND PEOPLE WON'T BE

01:29:18.252 --> 01:29:19.620
ABLE TO ACCESS THE LEGAL MARKET

01:29:19.687 --> 01:29:20.855
AND THEY COULD CONTINUE INTO THE

01:29:20.922 --> 01:29:22.490
ILLEGAL MARKET SO.

01:29:22.557 --> 01:29:24.192
I MEAN THAT'S REALLY THAT THE

01:29:24.258 --> 01:29:26.394
THE THE POLICY POINT HERE IS

01:29:26.461 --> 01:29:28.362
THAT IF IT WERE NOT A FULLY

01:29:28.429 --> 01:29:29.363
EXEMPTING PEOPLE FROM SEEK

01:29:29.430 --> 01:29:31.032
WHETHER TO THE SEQUEL EXEMPTIONS

01:29:31.099 --> 01:29:31.733
ARE.

01:29:31.799 --> 01:29:33.334
IF YOU HAVE A LOCAL ORDINANCE IN

01:29:33.401 --> 01:29:35.470
PLACE HOUSE YOU HAVE TO REQUIRED

01:29:35.536 --> 01:29:37.405
DISCRETIONARY REVIEW LOCALLY FOR

01:29:37.472 --> 01:29:38.573
SITE SPECIFIC.

01:29:38.639 --> 01:29:40.908
PROJECTS SO YOU JUST YOU HAVE TO

01:29:40.975 --> 01:29:42.276
COMPLETE YOUR SEEK WHAT PROCESS

01:29:42.343 --> 01:29:43.811
ON THE ACTUAL AUTHORIZATION AT A

01:29:43.878 --> 01:29:44.979
LATER DATE.

01:29:45.046 --> 01:29:46.214
AND THE SECOND ONE IS SAYING

01:29:46.280 --> 01:29:47.548
THAT IT HAPPENED SPEAK WHAT HAS

01:29:47.615 --> 01:29:49.550
TO BE UNDER WAY FOR THE LICENSEE.

01:29:49.617 --> 01:29:51.185
AND WE ALSO HAVE A PROVISION

01:29:51.252 --> 01:29:52.887
THAT SAYS IF THE JURISDICTION

01:29:52.954 --> 01:29:53.955
TELLS US THAT THEY'RE NOT

01:29:54.021 --> 01:29:55.289
DILIGENTLY ACTIVELY WORKING

01:29:55.356 --> 01:29:56.624
TOWARDS THAT THAT WE CAN SUSPEND

01:29:56.691 --> 01:29:58.126
AND REVOKE THEIR LICENSE.

01:29:58.192 --> 01:29:59.794
SO IT'S NOT WITHOUT WERE ASKING

01:29:59.861 --> 01:30:01.896
TO LIKE FOR FULL SEQUEL -- NON

01:30:01.963 --> 01:30:03.564
COMPLIANCE WE REALIZE THAT

01:30:03.631 --> 01:30:05.166
THAT'S AN IMPORTANT ELEMENT BUT

01:30:05.233 --> 01:30:06.868
WE REALIZE THAT THIS IS A MARKET

01:30:06.934 --> 01:30:07.835
IN TRANSITION THAT NEEDS A

01:30:07.902 --> 01:30:09.403
PERIOD WHERE WE CAN HAVE PEOPLE

01:30:09.470 --> 01:30:11.172
THAT ARE IN OR PART WAY AND SO

01:30:11.239 --> 01:30:12.373
WE CAN GUIDE THEM TO FULL

01:30:12.440 --> 01:30:13.574
LICENSURE.

01:30:13.641 --> 01:30:14.942
AND IT'S A PROTECTION OF THE

01:30:15.009 --> 01:30:18.980
ENVIRONMENT IN THE LONG TERM I

01:30:19.046 --> 01:30:19.480
THINK.

01:30:19.547 --> 01:30:20.214
TO I WANT TO BE SURE.

01:30:20.281 --> 01:30:21.449
THROUGH THE THROUGH THE CHAIR.

01:30:21.516 --> 01:30:22.817
I DO WANT TO BE SURE THAT WE

01:30:22.884 --> 01:30:24.552
DON'T.

01:30:24.619 --> 01:30:25.586
WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT THE

01:30:25.653 --> 01:30:27.054
BALANCE?

01:30:27.121 --> 01:30:28.523
IN.

01:30:28.589 --> 01:30:30.625
IN THIS THIS SPACE.

01:30:30.691 --> 01:30:33.995
THAT WE DON'T GIVE MORE VALUE TO

01:30:34.061 --> 01:30:36.964
A BUSINESS ENTITY SIMPLY BECAUSE

01:30:37.031 --> 01:30:38.466
IT'S A BIT CANNABIS BUSINESS

01:30:38.533 --> 01:30:40.635
ENTITY.

01:30:40.701 --> 01:30:44.272
ON THE BALANCE WITH A COMMUNITY

01:30:44.338 --> 01:30:45.907
THAT IS GOING TO HAVE.

01:30:45.973 --> 01:30:49.143
THIS ENTITY IN THEIR MIDST.

01:30:49.210 --> 01:30:51.746
OUR OUR OUR COMMUNITIES ALREADY

01:30:51.813 --> 01:30:53.681
ARE OVER BURDENED IN SO MANY

01:30:53.748 --> 01:30:54.682
WAYS.

01:30:54.749 --> 01:30:57.318
AND SEEK WELL THE SEQUEL PROCESS

01:30:57.385 --> 01:30:59.086
IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. FOR

01:30:59.153 --> 01:31:01.289
PROTECTIONS FOR OUR COMMUNITIES.

01:31:01.355 --> 01:31:03.457
AND IF.

01:31:03.524 --> 01:31:07.228
A LOCAL GOVERNMENT IS.

01:31:07.295 --> 01:31:09.831
IS ALLOWED TO DECIDE WHETHER A

01:31:09.897 --> 01:31:11.566
CANNABIS BUSINESS IS MORE

01:31:11.632 --> 01:31:13.401
IMPORTANT THAN THE HEALTH OF

01:31:13.467 --> 01:31:14.669
THEIR COMMUNITY.

01:31:14.735 --> 01:31:16.838
AND THEY SIDE WITH CANNABIS THAT

01:31:16.904 --> 01:31:19.273
IS EXTREMELY.

01:31:19.340 --> 01:31:21.375
PREJUDICIAL TO COMMUNITIES LIKE

01:31:21.442 --> 01:31:24.679
MINE.

01:31:24.745 --> 01:31:26.113
SO I HOPE THAT.

01:31:26.180 --> 01:31:28.082
THOSE DISCUSSIONS CONTINUE AND

01:31:28.149 --> 01:31:30.384
I'M SURE THAT THEY WILL.

01:31:30.451 --> 01:31:31.853
A ONE MORE QUESTION IF I MAY --

01:31:31.919 --> 01:31:33.621
MISTER CHAIR.

01:31:33.688 --> 01:31:36.157
IN THE LANGUAGE ITSELF WHERE

01:31:36.224 --> 01:31:38.893
TALKS ABOUT THE LOCAL EQUITY

01:31:38.960 --> 01:31:41.229
PROGRAM WHICH I THINK IS A

01:31:41.295 --> 01:31:44.765
LAUDABLE -- IDEA.

01:31:44.832 --> 01:31:49.136
IN ONE OF THOSE -- ONE ONE

01:31:49.203 --> 01:31:51.339
ASSISTANCE.

01:31:51.405 --> 01:31:53.674
THE ASSISTANCE IT THERE CAN BE

01:31:53.741 --> 01:31:55.810
PROVIDED.

01:31:55.877 --> 01:31:58.779
TO THOSE DEALING IN CANNABIS.

01:31:58.846 --> 01:32:00.381
IT STATES ASSISTANCE SECURING

01:32:00.448 --> 01:32:03.684
CAPITAL INVESTMENTS FOR DIRECT

01:32:03.751 --> 01:32:05.486
ACCESS TO CAPITAL.

01:32:05.553 --> 01:32:06.487
IS THIS SOMETHING MORE THERE'S

01:32:06.554 --> 01:32:08.122

01:32:13.227 --> 01:32:13.461
[inaudible]

01:32:13.527 --> 01:32:16.264
SO -- THE I MEAN THE THIS

01:32:16.330 --> 01:32:17.999
FUNDING IS SPECIFIC TO THE

01:32:18.065 --> 01:32:19.967
CANNABIS INDUSTRY -- THERE ARE

01:32:20.034 --> 01:32:21.302
SMALL BUSINESS TECHNICAL

01:32:21.369 --> 01:32:23.571
ASSISTANCE CENTERS -- AND WE

01:32:23.638 --> 01:32:25.172
ACTUALLY ESTABLISHED A TWENTY

01:32:25.239 --> 01:32:27.541

REFLECTED HERE BUT THIS IS VERY

01:32:43.624 --> 01:32:44.825
UNIQUE AND SPECIFIC BECAUSE

UNFORTUNATELY THIS INDUSTRY HAS

01:32:46.260 --> 01:32:49.196

01:35:32.126 --> 01:35:34.228
ESSENTIALLY LOOK AT THIS BILL AS

01:35:34.295 --> 01:35:35.529
A TIME EXTENSION FOR THE SEQUEL

01:35:35.596 --> 01:35:36.897

AND THAT REALLY IS A SORT OF THE

01:35:50.711 --> 01:35:52.880
PURPOSE OF THIS -- THIS BILL IS

01:35:52.947 --> 01:35:54.281
TO PROVIDE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

01:36:39.927 --> 01:36:40.995

REASONABLE INCREASE THAT'S VERY

01:45:09.069 --> 01:45:09.870
HARD TO DO THAT.

01:45:09.936 --> 01:45:12.406

01:45:29.856 --> 01:45:31.324
INCREASE.

01:45:31.391 --> 01:45:32.859
IT'S DIFFICULT FOR US TO DECIDE --
