RUDY SALAS I AM THE CHAIR OF THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE AUDIT COMMITTEE WE'RE GONNA GO AHEAD AND CALL THE OVERSIGHT HEARING OF THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE AUDIT COMMITTEE THE ASSEMBLY VETERANS AFFAIRS COMMITTEE. ON THE SENATE VETERANS AFFAIRS COMMITTEE TO WATER THIS MORNING WE WILL DISCUSS THE FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS IDENTIFIED BY THE STATE AUDITOR. AND HER AUDIT REPORT RELEASED IN JANUARY OF THIS YEAR. TITLED CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS AND PART OF GENERAL SERVICES THE DEPARTMENT'S MISMANAGEMENT OF THE VETERANS HOME PROPERTIES HAS NOT SERVED VETERANS BEST INTEREST. AND HAS BEEN DETRIMENTAL TO THE STATE. I WANT TO THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER IRWIN -- FOR REQUESTING THIS AUDIT AND HELPING TO ENSURE THAT THE VETERANS HOME PROPERTIES ARE BEING USED TO BENEFIT VETERANS. WE WILL ALSO DISCUSS THE DEPARTMENT OF VETERAN AFFAIRS OF THE DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL SERVICES PLANS TO IMPLEMENT CHANGES. AND CORRECTIVE ACTIONS -- INCLUDING THE STATE AUDITOR'S RECOMMENDATIONS TO HELP INSURE THAT VETERANS HOME PROPERTIES ARE BENEFITING. VETERANS. AS YOU KNOW CAL VANCE MANAGES EIGHT VETERANS HOMES IN THE STATE I WHICH VETERANS ARE PROVIDED RESIDENTIAL REHABILITATIVE AND MEDICAL CARE. WITH CAL THAT'S CONSENT. DJ S. CAN LEASE PROPERTY AT THE HOMES TO THIRD PARTIES AS LONG AS A LEASES ARE IN THE BEST INTEREST OF VETERANS. AND THE OTHER REPORTS STATE AUDITOR FOUND D. G. S. COULD NOT EXPLAIN HOW IT. HAD ESTABLISHED RENTAL RATES -- SOME RENTAL RATES ERE FAR BELOW CURRENT MARKET RATES SOME THIRD PARTY OCCUPANT. SOME THIRD PARTIES OCCUPY THE HOMES PROPERTY WITHOUT WRITTEN AGREEMENTS THAT WOULD PROTECT. THE STATE FROM LIABILITY. SOME LEASES WERE INCONSISTENT WITH THE VETERANS HOMES BEST INTERESTS AND VIOLATED LAWS. THE REPORT ALSO FOUND THAT THE GS IN CALVET FELL TO ENSURE THAT -- OVER HALF A MILLION DOLLARS RECEIVED FROM LEASES WERE SPENT TO BENEFIT OUR VETERANS -- THAT ONE OF THE MOST SURPRISING THINGS. IS THAT IN TWENTY THIRTEEN THE STATE AUDITOR PRODUCED REPORT STATING THE YOUNG WILL VETERANS HOME IMPROPERLY ENTERED INTO TO LEASES THAT VIOLATED STATE LAW. ONE LEASE WAS FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF AN ADVENTURE PARK. INCLUDING SEVEN ZIP LINES ON ALMOST TWO HUNDRED ACRES OF THE VETERANS HOME PROPERTY. THE STATE EVENTUALLY HAD TO PAY GET OUT OF THAT LEASE. AND TWENTY FOURTEEN THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE CRITICIZED CALVET FOR FAILING TO OBTAIN TGS IS APPROVAL. AND FOR FAILING TO MONITOR AND ENFORCE COMPLAIN FOR THIS OVERSIGHT HEARING IS THAT. WE WILL. MY GOAL IS REALLY FOR US TO SEE CANCERS AND TO FIND REMEDY SO THAT WE CAN BETTER SERVE OUR VETERANS. AND BETTER MOVE FORWARD WITH THESE LEASES WITH THIRD PARTY BUSINESS VENDORS HAVE THAT ACCOUNTABILITY -- LESS LIABILITY ON THE STATE BUT ALSO BELIEVE THAT WE'RE DOING THE MOST THAT WE CAN TO PROTECT OUR VETERANS AND ENSURE THAT -- WE'RE DOING EVERYTHING THAT WE CAN FOR FOR OUR MILITARY VETERANS -- WITH THEM I MOVED TO OPENING COMMENTS FROM THE CHAIRS AT THIS TIME WE'RE GONNA MOVE TO ASSEMBLYWOMAN JACQUI IRWIN WHO IS CHAIR OF THE ASSEMBLY VETERANS COMMITTEE. MR ONE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. HELLO OF THIRD AS THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR -- FOR CONVENING THIS HEARING AND THANK YOU TO THE STATE AUDITOR. AND THE TEAM THAT CARRIED OUT THE AUDIT I REQUESTED THIS AUDIT LAST YEAR ON THE STRENGTH OF SOME INFORMATION MY STAFF HAD REQUESTED FROM. CALVET WHICH ITSELF LEAD TO OTHER DISCOVERIES BY THE DEPARTMENT ITSELF AS THE AUDIT MAKES CLEAR. BUT WE COULD NEVER UNDERTAKEN A THOROUGH INVESTIGATION OF THESE USES OF REAL PROPERTY WITHOUT THE AUDITOR'S RESOURCES AND INDEPENDENT AUTHORITY. THANK YOU I'D ALSO LIKE TO THANK -- CALVET SECRETARY DR. IT CAN'T BE EASY TO STAND UP AND TAKE ACCOUNTABILITY IS FOR PRACTICES THAT -- PRECEDED YOU IN MOST CASES BY DECADES. I FOUND THAT YOU IN YOUR DEPARTMENT OR A FORTHCOMING ABOUT THE AUDIT AND ITS FINDINGS AND RESPONSIVE AND I LOOK FORWARD. TO FOLLOWING UP ON THE WORK HAT YOU'VE DONE IN IMPROVING CONDITIONS AND PRACTICES AT THE HOME BY. TAKING ON TOGETHER SOME OF THE PROBLEMS THAT THIS AUDIT UNCOVERED. AND THANK YOU TO TO TGS FOR MAKING IT STAFF AVAILABLE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS FROM THE PANEL. IN PRINCIPLE GUIDING MY APPROACH TODAY IS THAT WE ARE HERE TO SHINE A LIGHT ON STATE PRACTICES AND PROCEDURES IN THE INTEREST OF BETTER. AND MORE TRANSPARENT -- THE GOVERNMENT I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT THE MUSEUM THE THEATER -- AND AND OTHER BUILDINGS ARE VALUED COMMUNITY RESOURCES THAT PROVIDE MUTUAL BENEFITS TO THE HOME IT'S RESIDENTS. AND THE RESIDENTS OF YON PHIL THE QUESTION FOR ME IS HOW STATE AGENCIES ARE CONDUCTING THE BUSINESS OF THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. MY QUESTIONS TODAY WILL BE DIRECTED AT INVESTIGATING THE PROCESS OR LACK OF ONE THAT GOT US HERE. AND THAT WILL INFORM THE DESIGN OF A BETTER ONE WE NEED TO GET THIS RIGHT STRIKING THE RIGHT BALANCE WILL BE BETTER FOR EVERYBODY INVOLVED. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SEVEN WOMEN URBAN AT THIS I'M GONNA MOVE TO SENATOR ARCHULETA WHO IS. THE CHAIR OF THE SENATE -- VETERANS AFFAIRS COMMITTEE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND I'D LIKE TO BEGIN BY SAY THANK YOU -- TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER SALAS ASSEMBLY MEMBER IRWIN THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND AND YOUR PARTICIPATION BRING US ALL TOGETHER. AND LADIES AND GENTLEMEN WE'RE HERE TO CONTINUE OUR RESPECT AND HONOR FOR THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO SERVE THIS GREAT COUNTRY. AND I'D LIKE TO THINK THAT THAT SHOULD BE THE BACKBONE SHIN HOW BEST TO SERVE AND REPRESENT. THE HONORABLE MEN AND WOMEN WHO HAVE GIVEN SO MUCH TO OUR COUNTRY THOSE WHO SERVE IN THE ARMY NAVY AIR FORCE MARINE CORPS COAST GUARD. THEY ALL NEED TO BE RECOGNIZED AND HONORED AND I THINK THAT THIS AUDIT. IN THIS PARTICIPATION OF FROM THE SECRETARY BETTER TO FAIRS AND ALL THOSE INVOLVED WILL BRING THIS TO LIGHT -- IT THIS IS NOT TO BE A WITCH HUNT THIS IS TO BE AN INFORMANT INFORMANT I I'M SORRY INFORMATION BEHIND -- PARTICIPATION TO WHICH ALL OF US CAN AGREE THAT WE NEED TO MAKE SOME CORRECTIONS. WE'VE HEARD FROM BOTH -- CHAIRED CO CHAIR OF THE ISSUES OF COURSE PERTAINING TO THE PROPERTY THE USE THAT LEASES -- MY CONCERN OF COURSE IS THE THE TREATMENT OF THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO ARE -- RESIDENTS OF OUR VETERANS HOMES AND THAT IT'S IMPORTANT BUT IT IS A BUSINESS IN A BUSINESS SHOULD BE RUN. WITH DIGNITY AND HONOR IN ESPECIALLY OUR VETERANS HOMES AND I'M SO PROUD. TO SHARE WITH YOU I SURE BUT THE EIGHTY SECOND AIRBORNE AND AND I KNOW THAT -- ALL THESE MEN AND WOMEN WHO GIVEN THEIR LIVES OR FAMILIES AND SO ON AND GOT TO BE RECOGNIZED THEY BRING ALONG WITH EACH YEAR -- POSITIVE MEETING INFORMATIVE MEETING AS I MENTIONED AND AND SEE WHAT STEPS ARE NECESSARY TO BE TAKEN -- NOT JUST IN THE FUTURE BUT IMMEDIATELY IMMEDIATELY BEGINNING TODAY AFTER THIS MEETING. THAT WHAT CAN BE DONE. AND I'M HOPING THE SECRETARY WILL PICK UP THE TELEPHONE AND AND GET AN ACCURATE ACCOUNT OF EXACT WHAT'S TAKING PLACE AND TAKE -- HIS PLAN OF CORRECTIVE NESTS INTO ACTION AND HIS STAFF AND EVERYONE ELSE. AND OF COURSE THE THE AUDIT IS IN DEPTH -- IT IS NOT -- PRETTY TO BE HONEST WITH YOU -- BUT AS FACTUAL AND THE DATA IS THERE. TO SHOW THAT WE NEED TO COME TOGETHER THE CORRECTION OF THESE ISSUES AND AGAIN I'D LIKE. TO SAY THAT I I THANK THE ASSEMBLY MEMBERS WHO ARE HERE IN THE SENATORS YOU'RE HERE. BECAUSE THIS IS A TEAM EFFORT. TO BRING THE STAND HONOR MEN AND WOMEN IN UNIFORM AND OUR VETERANS AND I THANK YOU. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THOSE COMMENTS AND I THINK -- WHAT YOU'RE HEARING FROM EACH OF THE CHAIRS AS WE'RE REALLY LOOKING AT TRYING TO IDENTIFY SOLUTIONS MOVING FORWARD -- WE KNOW THE AUDIT REPORTS WHETHER YOU GO ALL THE WAY BACK TO TWENTY THIRTEEN IN THE ONE OF THE FIRST OUT ITS. THAT IDENTIFIED SOME OF THESE ISSUES -- BUT THE ULTIMATE GOAL IS HOW DO WE BEST SERVE VETERANS AND WHAT ACTION ITEMS CAN WE TAKE TO FIX THOSE ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED IN REPEATED AUDITS AND ALSO. IN THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCES FINDINGS AS WELL SO WITH THAT WE'RE GONNA GO AHEAD AND START WITH A START WITH THE CHEN ITEM NUMBER TWO AN OVERVIEW OF THE AUDIT FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS SO IF WE COULD PLEASE HAVE -- MISS HOW AND HER TEAM APPROACH. AND PLEASE JUST GIVE US. IF YOU JUST GIVE US A BACKGROUND A PRESENTATION ON YOUR FINDINGS. AND PLEASE BEGIN WHEN YOU ARE READY THANK YOU [inaudible] WE'RE THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND YOUR WOMAN IRWIN CHAIRMAN ARCHULETA -- AND MEMBERS OF ALL THE COMMITTEES THAT ARE HERE TODAY FOR THE RECORD MY NAME IS ELAINE HOW ON THE CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR. TO MY RIGHT IS AMANDA MELON AMANDA WAS THE AUDIT TEAM SUPERVISOR WORKING WITH STAFF OUT AT THE HOMES PRIMARILY WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME AT YOUNG BILL BECAUSE THEY HAVE -- THE MAJORITY OF THE LEASES THAT WE LOOKED AT BUT WE ALSO SPENT SOME TIME AT SOME OF THE OTHER HOMES AS WELL. SO TO LAY OUT WHAT WE'RE GOING TO PRESENT WE HAD ACTUALLY THREE KEY ISSUES IN THE AUDIT REPORT. THE FIRST ISSUE IS RELATED TO THE AGREE -- THE HOMES ENTERED INTO WITH VARIOUS ENTITIES AND CONCERNS WE HAD WITH THOSE LEASES THE LENGTH OF THE LACES SOME OF THE TERMS IN THE LEASES. THE SECOND ISSUE IS RELATED TO ACTUALLY COLLECTING REVENUE COLLECTING -- THE THE LEASE REVENUE OTHER TYPES OF PAYMENTS EMPLOYEE HOUSING PAYMENTS THOSE SORTS OF THINGS WE HAD SOME CONCERNS WITH RESPECT TO THAT. AND THE LAST ISSUE WAS -- AND AMANDA WILL COVER THE THE THIRD ISSUE RELATED -- TO THE STATE REALLY BEING PUT AT RISK IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE THERE ARE EVENTS OCCURRING PARTICULARLY AT THE I DON'T FEEL FACILITY WHERE THE STATE DIDN'T HAVE A WRITTEN AGREEMENT AND REALLY DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING THAT WOULD PROTECT. THE STATE AGAINST ANY POTENTIAL LIABILITY PROPERTY DAMAGE THOSE SORTS OF THINGS NOW WE DON'T NECESSARILY SAY IN THE REPORT THAT THESE AREN'T EVENTS THAT WERE BENEFICIAL TO VETERANS. OUR CONCERN IS REALLY MAKING SURE THAT THE STATE IS PROPERLY NEGOTIATING WITH A PARTICULAR ENTITIES ENTER ENTER IT TO THE APPROPRIATE TYPES OF AGREEMENTS -- TO PROTECT THE STATE ASSURE THAT THE STATE GETS -- YOU KNOW THE ASSOCIATED VALUE BECAUSE ULTIMATELY THAT MONEY GOES INTO THE HOMES AND AGAIN IS FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE VETERANS EITHER IN THE GENERAL FUND TO BENEFIT THE HOMES IN GENERAL OR AT A SPECIFIC HOME LIKE YOU DON'T BILL WHERE IT WOULD GO INTO THE MORALE FUND. THAT DIRECTLY BENEFITS -- VETERANS. SO LET ME START WITH THE FIRST ISSUE -- AND THIS IS RELATED TO AGREEMENTS THAT CALVET INDEED YES ENTERED INTO THE LEASES -- AND I AS OUR TITLE SAYS CALVET INDEED YES ESTABLISHED AGREEMENTS THAT WERE OF QUESTIONABLE BENEFIT AS YOU SAID MISTER CHAIRMAN AND AND I THINK MS OR ONE SPOKE ABOUT IT IS. DTS HAS THE AUTHORITY TO THE PERMISSION OF CAL THAT PARTICULAR RELATED TO TO PROPERTIES AT THE PARTICULAR HOMES BUT WHAT THE STATE LAW SPECIFICALLY REQUIRES IS THAT. THE DECISION HAS TO BE BASED ON IS THIS LEAST IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE HOME. AND WHEN WE WERE LOOKING AT THE LEASES AND WE WERE ASKING QUESTIONS OF BOTH CALVET INDEED YES. NEITHER OF THEM COULD REALLY SHOW US ANY SPECIFIC CRITERIA THAT THEY USED TO DETERMINE THAT THIS PARTICULAR LEASE -- THAT WE WERE LOOKING AT WAS IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE HOME. SO WE HAD CONCERNS WITH RESPECT TO THAT. NOW ONE THING THAT YOU'LL HEAR A THEME THROUGH PART OF MY PRESENTATION CERTAINLY AMANDA'S IS -- THE THE VETERANS AFFAIRS SECRETARY AND THE DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS WAS VERY RESPONSIVE VERY EASY TO WORK WITH DURING THE COURSE OF THIS AUDIT. THAT IS NOT TYPICAL WHEN WE WHEN WE ARE OUT CONDUCTING AUDITS SO THEY ACTUALLY TOOK SOME CORRECTIVE ACTION. WHILE WE WERE CONDUCTING THE WORK AS WE WOULD BRING ISSUES TO THEIR ATTENTION THEY WOULD TRY TO ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE ISSUES IMMEDIATELY. AND WITH RESPECT -- TO THE THE DISCUSSION I JUST HAD AS FAR AS THE BEST INTERESTS OF THE HOME WE WERE STILL CONDUCTING ON IT WORK WE DIDN'T ISSUE THIS AUDIT UNTIL JANUARY OF THIS YEAR. BUT CALVET ACTUALLY DISTRIBUTED A MEMO TO ALL THEIR HOME ADMINISTRATORS IN DECEMBER OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE. TO THE ADMINISTRATORS ABOUT WHAT THEY FELT AS THE APPROPRIATE CRITERIA FOR BEST INTEREST OF THE HOME. WE STILL HAVE A RECOMMENDATION RELATED TO THAT IT'S TO WORK WITH THE GS SINCE TGS ULTIMATELY APPROVES LEASES. THEY NEED TO AGREE ON WHAT THAT CRITERIA SHOULD BE SO ESSENTIALLY CAL THAT HAS TAKEN A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION WE JUST WANT TO SEE FURTHER. DISCUSSIONS AND FINALIZING THAT PARTICULAR WORK -- WE ALSO SAW A SECOND ISSUE RELATED TO LEASES IS THE TERMS OF THE LEASES. GENERALLY A STATE LAW REQUIRES A LEASE TO NOT EXCEED FIVE YEARS -- BUT MANY OF THESE LEASES WERE FOR LONGER PERIODS OF TIME THIRTY FORTY FIFTY YEARS -- IN SOME INSTANCES ALSO WHEN WE WERE LOOKING AT THE LANGUAGE IN THE LEASES WE HAVE ATTORNEYS -- WORK WITH ALL OF OUR STAFF. THE LEASE TERMS DID NOT ALLOW THE STATE TO TERMINATE THE LEASE ON AT ITS DISCRETION AND TYPICALLY THAT'S WHAT YOU HAVE IN A CONTRACT TO RELEASE THE STATE SHOULD HAVE THE ABILITY TO SAY WE WANT TO TERMINATE THIS LEASE WE WANT TO GET OUT OF IT. THE TERMINATION LANGUAGE THAT WE SIGNED THE LEASE IS REALLY ONLY COULD HAPPEN. IF THERE WAS A BREACH OF THE LEASE TERMS SO WE FELT THAT THE THE DEPARTMENT GENERAL SERVICES AND CAL THAT NEED TO TAKE A LOOK AT SOME OF THOSE TERMS IN THOSE LEASES. TO REALLY STRENGTHEN THE STATE'S POSITION WITH RESPECT TO THAT. WE IDENTIFIED ONE LEAST THAT HAD NOT BEEN APPROVED BY DE GS. AND BASED ON STATE LAW THAT LEASES ESSENTIALLY VOID OR VOIDABLE SO WE HAVEA RECOMMENDATION TO DG ASKING CAL THAT. TO WORK THIS IS A LEASE RELATED TO THE SWIMMING POOL WITH THE TOWN -- AND SO WE NEED THE STATE NEEDS TO CAL THAT DID YES NEEDS TO WORK WITH THE TOWN TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT THEY DO WANT TO ENTER INTO A LEASE CONTINUED UP THE POLE FUNCTIONING BECAUSE IT'S A BENEFIT. TO TO THE COMMUNITY -- BUT THERE NEEDS TO THAT IS -- THE THE TERMS ARE DISCUSSED AGREED UPON AND ESSENTIALLY APPROVED BY TGS SO WHERE RECOMMENDATION RELATED TO THAT. NOW THE OTHER LEASES THAT WE LOOK AT WERE HOUSING -- AND MANY STATE AGENCIES PROVIDE EMPLOYEE HOUSING. AND WHEN WE LOOKED AT THESE LEASES FOR EMPLOYEES -- TO TO HAVE HOUSING ON ON THERE YOU DON'T FEEL CAMPUS IN PARTICULAR -- THAT AGAIN THEY LACKED THOSE KEY TERMS TO PROTECT THE STATE'S INTEREST THEY HAD THE DEVELOPED REQUIREMENTS FOR LEASES BUT THEY DIDN'T INCLUDE CERTAIN TERMS AND CONDITIONS. IN ALL OF THE AGREEMENTS WE SAW INCONSISTENCIES BETWEEN THE VARIOUS LEASES WITH -- INDIVIDUAL EMPLOYEES -- THEY ALSO DIDN'T PROTECT THE STATE AGAINST LIABILITY -- AND SHIELDING THE STATE SO AGAIN SIMILAR TO THE LEASES -- FOR SOME OF THE OTHER -- ENTITIES LIKE THE MUSEUM THE THEATER AT CETERA THESE EMPLOYEE LEASES THE TERMS DID NOT HAVE. THE APPROPRIATE LANGUAGE TO REALLY PROTECT THE STATE SO WE FELT THAT CAL THAT NEEDED TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THAT AGAIN THIS WAS EVEN PRIOR TO THE AUDIT. BECAUSE THE AGENCY WANTS THE WAS APPROVED REALLY KIND OF JUMPED ON PARTICULAR ISSUES AND WANTED TO HAVE AN UNDERSTANDING SO AS WE SAY IN THE REPORT -- AS EARLY AS MAY OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN CALVET ISSUED A DIRECTIVE TO THE HOME ADMINISTRATOR STATE SAYING THAT HEADQUARTERS WAS GOING TO TAKE CONTROL. OF APPROVING EMPLOYEE HOUSING LEASES -- BECAUSE THERE WAS SO MUCH INCONSISTENCY HUG HEADQUARTERS FELT THEY WANTED TO TAKE THAT RESPONSIBILITY AT HEADQUARTERS SO THEY COULD CONTROL IT -- AND BE IN CHARGE OF THAT THEY ALSO. ADOPTED A POLICY IN NOVEMBER OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND AGAIN THIS IS DISCUSSED IN THE REPORT. THAT CAL VETS POLICY WITH RESPECT EMPLOYEE HOUSING WILL MIRROR WHAT CAL HR OUR STATE AGENCY HAS RESPONSIBILITY. FOR HOUSING ARRANGEMENTS AND AND UNDERSTANDING HOW THOSE ARRANGEMENTS SHOULD BE PUT TOGETHER AND WHAT THE STATE AGENCY SHOULD BE DOING -- CAL THAT AB ESSENTIALLY ADOPTED KELLY CHARGE POLICY SO AGAIN TAKING SOME OF CORRECTIVE ACTION DURING THE COURSE OF THE AUDIT WITH THAT WHILE WE WERE CONDUCTING IT. AND THEN THE LAST ISSUE IN THIS PARTICULAR AREA IS REALLY WE FELT THAT CALVET NEEDED STRONGER POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THEY REALLY DIDN'T HAVE ANY STRUCTURE. AS FAR AS GUIDANCE FOR THE INDIVIDUAL -- ADMINISTER YOURSELF TO VARIOUS HOMES SO WE HAVE SOME RECOMMENDATIONS RELATED TO THAT AND AGAIN CAL THAT IS WHAT WAS WORKING ON AND PUBLISH SOME POLICIES IN DECEMBER OF EIGHTEEN SO OUR RECOMMENDATIONS IN THE REPORT ARE YOU'VE GOTTEN A GOOD START ON THIS. YOU NEED TO CONTINUE -- TO FINALIZE YOUR POLICIES BUT THEN ALL ISMS TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE POLICIES ARE BEING ENFORCED. SO THAT WAS OUR FIRST SECTION -- UP THE AUDIT REPORT AND I KNOW ASSEMBLY MEMBER IRWIN HAS A BILL RELATED TO THE FIVE YEAR WINDOW -- AS FAR AS THE STATURE BECAUSE WE MADE A LEGISLATIVE RECOMMENDATION AND I UNDERSTAND -- AB -- TWO FORTY BY MS OR WHEN IS IS ADDRESSING THAT PARTICULAR SITUATION. NOW THE SECOND ISSUE THAT I'M GOING TO GO OVER IS RELATED TO COLLECTION OF RENTAL. FEES AND PAYMENTS SO WHEN WE TALKED TO DJ YES WE ASK TGS HOW DID YOU DETERMINE WHAT THE RENTAL RATE WOULD BE FOR THESE PARTICULAR FACILITIES THEIR REQUIRED. BY STATE LAW TO MAKE SURE A RENTAL RATES ARE AT MARKET VALUE -- INDEED YES HAD A VERY DIFFICULT TIME IN SHOWING US EVIDENCE THAT THEY REALLY DETERMINED THAT THE RENTS THAT WERE BEING CHARGED. TO VARIOUS FACILITIES WERE REALLY AT MARKET RATE -- SO AGAIN WE HAD A RECOMMENDATION -- TO DEPARTMENT GENERAL SERVICES THERE ARE ALSO PROVISIONS THAT ALLOW AN ENTITY IF AN ENTITY PROVIDE SERVICES OR I'M SOME OTHER IMPROVEMENTS TO A PROPERTY THAT SHOULD BE REFLECTED IN THE RENTAL RATES SO THE RENTAL RATE MAKE. THE MARKET RATE MAY BE A CERTAIN AMOUNT BUT IT'S REDUCED BY DID YES TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE ENTITY THAT'S RENTING THAT PARTICULAR FACILITY. FROM CAL THAT OR A PARTICULAR THAT'S ACKNOWLEDGED AS PART OF THE CALCULATION BUT AGAIN WE DIDN'T SEE ANY EVIDENCE OF THAT SO WE REALLY FELT THE TGS NEEDS TO DO A BETTER JOB. OF MAKING SURE THAT IT CAN DEFEND -- WHAT RATES? THEY ARE DETERMINING ARE THE APPROPRIATE RATES FOR THESE PARTICULAR FACILITIES -- THE MISTER CHAIRMAN YOU TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT LOOKING AT PROCEEDS SO -- STATE LAW REQUIRES THAT PROCEEDS FROM LEASES A VETERANS HOMES BE DEPOSITED INTO THE GENERAL FUND AND THEN THAT AUGMENT THAT IS IS A IT'S DONE BY CAL VET BUT THEN CAL THAT HAS RESPONSIBILITY TO NOTIFY THE DEPARTMENT FINANCE AND CERTAINLY THE LEGISLATURE BECAUSE THE WAY THE STATE LAW READS. RIGHT NOW IS ANY FUNDS COLLECTED FROM THESE LEASES GOING TO THE GENERAL FUND BUT THAT SHOULD -- ALSO HE'S RESULT IN AN AUGMENTATION -- TO THE APPROPRIATION FOR CALVET. BUT THAT'S THE PART THAT WASN'T HAPPENING CALVET WAS COLLECTING THE FUNDS THEY COLLECT ABOUT. THREE HUNDRED NINETY THOUSAND TGS COLLECTED -- A LITTLE OVER A HUNDRED EIGHTEEN THOUSAND A TGS INAPPROPRIATELY DEPOSIT THOSE FUNDS IN THE WRONG ACCOUNT THEY DID NOT DEPOSIT THEM IN THE GENERAL FUND SO WE HAVE A RECOMMENDATION RELATED TO THAT. THAT MONEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN APPROPRIATED TO THE GENERAL FUND AND IF CAL THAT HAD PROPERLY NOTIFIED FINANCE IN THE LEGISLATURE THAN THE LEGISLATURE COULD HAVE TAKEN ACTION IN AN AUGMENTED THE APPROPRIATION. THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN. SO WE HAVE OBVIOUSLY RECOMMENDATIONS RELATED TO THAT NOW THERE ARE SOME ENTITIES ON A A HOME -- AT K. AT A YOUNG FILL FOR EXAMPLE THERE'S A CONVENIENCE STORE THERE'S A GOLF COURSE THE WAY THE LEASES WORK FOR THOSE PARTICULAR ENTITIES -- THERE'S A PERCENTAGE OF THEIR SALES ESSENTIALLY THE CONVENIENCE STORE OR THE GOLF COURSE THE PERCENTAGE OF SALES SHOULD BE GOING TO CAL THAT -- WHAT WE FOUND WHEN WE STARTED LOOKING AT THE RECEIPTS AND WHAT CAL THAT WAS DOING TO MONITOR TO MAKE SURE IT WAS CAPTURING A RECEIVING ALL THE REVENUE IT WAS DO? WE FOUND IT WAS SHORT -- THOSE TWO ENTITIES HAD NOT. PAID OVER OVER A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS IN FEES TO BASED ON THE PERCENTAGE TO CAL THAT AGAIN THESE FUNDS WOULD GO INTO THE MORALE FUN SO AGAIN THIS IS A HIT ON THE VETERANS. SO CALVET NEEDS TO DO A BETTER JOB OF MAKING SURE THAT THEY'RE MONITORING -- WHAT THEY ARE ENTITLED TO RECEIVE FROM ENTITIES LIKE THE CONVENIENCE STORE OR THE GOLF COURSE SO WE HAVE RECOMMENDATIONS RELATED TO THAT? AND THEN THE LAST PIECE RELATED TO FEES IS TIED TO EMPLOYEE HOUSING. AS I SAID THEY THAT CAL THAT AT THAT POINT HAD NOT. DEVELOPED THE POLICY THAT WAS SIMILAR TO CALLIE CHARGE POLICY WHAT CAL HR REQUIRES STATE AGENCIES THAT PROVIDE EMPLOYEE HOUSING TO DO. IS HAVE THOSE AGENCIES MAKE SURE THEY'RE RENTING THE FACILITIES THE HOMES AT FAIR MARKET -- AND TO AT LEAST REVIEW ALL OF THE THE EMPLOYEE HOUSING LEASES EVERY SURE THERE AT MARKET WHAT CAL HR SUGGESTS IS DO 20% OF THE ASSESSMENTS. AND WHEN YOU HIT A FIVE YEAR WINDOW YOU'VE HAD EVERY SINGLE HOME -- CAL THAT WASN'T DOING THAT SO WHEN WE LOOKED AT THE EMPLOYEE HOUSING RATES AND COMPARE IT TO FAIR MARKET ON AVERAGE THEY WERE ALMOST A 100% BELOW. MARKET RATE SO THEY WERE SIGNIFICANTLY SHORT WE ACT WE CALCULATED ABOUT A HUNDRED FIFTY TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS JUST FOR FIFTEEN HOMES THERE FIFTEEN HOMES THAT WERE OCCUPIED. BY EMPLOYEES WHERE THIS THE CAL THAT HAD NOT BEEN RECEIVING -- THE APPROPRIATE AMOUNT OF RENT IF IT WAS AT MARKET RATES. NOW WHAT CALVET CAN DO -- THERE IS A LIMIT THEY CAN'T ALL OF A SUDDEN INCREASE ALL OF THOSE RENTS A 100%. THERE ARE. LIMITS AS TO WHAT IS AN AGENCY CAN DO IF THEY WANT TO INCREASE RENT THEY CAN ONLY INCREASE AT A YEAR -- SO THERE THERE WILL BE SOME TIME FOR THEM TO CATCH UP NOW IF ANY OF THOSE HOMES ARE VACATED BY AN EMPLOYEE IN A NEW PLAN PLOY HE COMES IN AND THEN THEY CAN RECTIFY AND GET TO MARKET RATE -- BUT AGAIN THEY THEY WERE AS HOMES AS FAR AS THE AMOUNT THEY WERE -- REQUIRING EMPLOYEES TO PAY. THE OTHER ISSUE THAT WE IDENTIFIED RELATED TO THAT IS THAT'S A FRINGE BENEFIT SO THOSE EMPTY THE THE DEPARTMENT SHOULD BE REPORTING THAT INFORMATION TO THE IRS BECAUSE YOU PAY TAXES ON THAT -- SO WE HAD A VARIETY OF RECOMMENDATIONS -- RELATED TO THIS PARTICULAR SECTION OF THE REPORT REALLY TALKING ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT. SEEKING THE AUGMENTATION NOW WHAT YOU WILL HEAR AND WE DISCUSSED IN THE REPORT WE TALK TO THE DEPARTMENTS ABOUT PARTICULARLY CAL THAT IS. THEIR THEIR PERSPECTIVE ON THE STATUTE THAT REQUIRES THEM TO COME TO THE LEGISLATURE AND FINANCE TO GET AN AUGMENTATION THEY BELIEVE THAT'S OUT OBSOLETE AND OUTDATED AND PERHAPS IT IS. BUT IT'S STILL ON THE BOOKS SO THAT'S WHAT WE SAID TO THEM IS IF YOU FEEL THAT THE STATUTE -- IS THE APPROPRIATE STATUTE AND SEEK THE AUGMENTATION IF YOU FEEL IT IT IS OUTDATED AND OBSOLETE THEN WE'VE GOT TO GET A MODIFICATION TO THAT STATUTE GET IT EITHER OFF THE YOU KNOW OFF THE BOOKS OR MODIFIED IN AN APPROPRIATE MANNER -- SO IT REFLECTS REALITY OF WHAT'S HAPPENING. TODAY. AND THEN THE OTHER ISSUES REALLY ARE JUST MAKING SURE YOU'RE TRACKING COMPLIANCE WITH PAYMENTS WITH RESPECT TO LEASES -- ANNUALLY REVIEWING THOSE RENTAL RATES FOR EMPLOYEE HOUSING AND THEN FOR RECOMMENDATIONS TO TGS RELATED TO THEIR DOCUMENTATION THEIR DECISION MAKING WITH RESPECT TO WHAT THEY'RE CHARGING FOR RENTAL RATES WHEN THEY LEASE PROPERTIES -- MAKING SURE THAT THEY'VE DOCUMENTED IF THEY MAKE A DECISION TO REDUCE THE RENTAL AMOUNT BASED ON IMPROVEMENTS OR OTHER SERVICES THAT ENTITIES PROVIDING TO THE STATE LET'S MAKE SURE ALL OF THAT IS PROPERLY DOCUMENTED IN THE IN THE FILES SO THAT. WE HAVE THAT INFORMATION -- WITH THAT I'M GONNA HANDED OVER TO MS MELON AND SHE'LL TALK ABOUT THE THE THE THIRD -- ISSUE WE IDENTIFIED IN THE TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS THANK YOU THANK YOU. HI GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEES MY NAME IS AMANDA MELON AND AS A STATE AUDITOR SAID I WAS A SUPERVISOR IN THIS PARTICULAR AUDIT. AND I'LL COVER THE LAST KEEP FINDING THAT WE MADE DURING OUR AUDIT. AND THAT WAS THAT CALVET HAD A VERY DISTANT APPROACH TO MANAGING THE USES OF THE PROPERTIES. AND THAT RESULTED IN USES THAT EXPOSE THE STATE AND THE HOME TO RISK OF LIABILITY. AND IT BECAUSE CALVET TO MISS AN OPPORTUNITY TO CLICK FUNDING THAT COULD HAVE GONE BACK TO THE HOME TO BENEFIT THE VETERAN RESIDENTS. SO FOR STARTERS THERE WERE FOUR ENTITIES THAT WERE OCCUPYING SPACE AT THE YOUNG BILL HOME. AND CAL THE HEADQUARTERS WAS UNAWARE THAT THEY WERE THERE. UNTIL THEY BEGAN PREPARING FOR AUDIT. ONE OF THOSE ENTITIES AS NAPA VALLEY COLLEGE IN THE OCCUPIED A SIZEABLE AMOUNT OF SPACE IN A FORMER I SEE YOU IN THE HOLDER IN BUILDING IN A HOSPITAL THERE. AND WE FOUND EVIDENCE THAT THEY HAD OCCUPIED SPACE AT THE HOME FOR THIRTY YEARS. SO IT WAS SURPRISING TO US THAT CALVET HEADQUARTERS IS UNAWARE THAT THEY WERE THERE. ON TOP OF THAT NONE OF THOSE FOR ENTITIES HAD WRITTEN AGREEMENTS FOR THE USE OF THEIR SPACE. SO THAT EXPOSE THE STATE TO SIGNIFICANT RISK OF LIABILITY IN THE EVENT THAT SOMETHING HAPPENED IN ONE OF THOSE SPACES. AND NONE OF THOSE ENTITIES WERE PAYING ANY RENT FOR THE SPACE THEY WERE OCCUPYING. AND SO CAL THAT HAD MISSED A REAL OPPORTUNITY TO COLLECT ADDITIONAL FUNDING THAT COULD HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE OPERATION OF THE HOME TO THE BENEFIT OF THE VETERAN RESIDENTS. SO WE MADE SOME RECOMMENDATIONS TO ON THIS THAT THEY REVIEW THOSE FOR ENTITIES AND EVALUATED DETERMINE WHETHER THEIR PRESENCE. IS IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF THE HOME AND IF THEY ARE WORK WITH TGS TO DEVELOP LEASE AGREEMENTS FOR THEM IF THEY'RE NOT THEY SHOULD HAVE PICKED THEM. AND SO CALVET STARTED WORKING ON THIS DURING OUR AUDIT NOW THEY REQUESTED AT LEAST FROM TGS FOR ONE OF THE ENTITIES A NAPA COUNTY HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES. AND IS REVIEWING THE OTHERS. THERE WERE OTHER USES OF THE PROPERTIES THAT CAL THAT WASN'T AWARE OF AS WELL. CALVET FOUND NOW IN OCTOBER. TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN THE YOUNG BILL HOME HAD BEEN PERMITTING SHORT TERM USES. OF THE PROPERTY -- BY THIRD PARTIES AND THAT THE HOME HAD NOT ALWAYS REQUIRED WRITTEN AGREEMENTS AGAIN EXPOSURE TO RISK. AND HAD NOT ALWAYS COLLECTED FEES FOR THOSE USES AGAIN FOR GOING FUNDING. SO WE EXPECTED THAT WHEN CAL THE HEADQUARTERS FOUND OUT ABOUT THESE USES THAT THEY WOULD TAKE APPROPRIATE STEPS TO ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES BUT IT DID NOT. IT DEVELOPED A WRITTEN AGREEMENT BUT IT ONLY REQUIRED THEM SOMETIMES IT DIDN'T REQUIRE EVERY THIRD PARTY THEY USE A PROPERTY TO SIGN IT. IT CHARGE SOME FEES BUT IT DIDN'T CHARGE THEM ALL OF THE TIME SOME PAID A FEE SOME DID NOT AND EVEN THOSE THAT DID PAY FEES THEY PAID INCONSISTENT FEES FOR THE SAME USE OF THE PROPERTY. BUT MOST TROUBLING IS THAT SIMILAR TO WHAT THE STATE AUDITOR SAID ABOUT THE LEASES OF THE PROPERTY IS THAT CALVET HAD NEVER DEFINED WHAT TYPES OF USES WOULD BE CONSISTENT WITH THE BEST INTERESTS OF THE HOME. AND IT PERMITTED ONE USE OF THE VETERANS HOME PROPERTY THAT WE FOUND WERE CONTRARY TO THOSE INTERESTS. SO CALVET PERMITTED A FILM CREW TO GO INTO THE WEST LOS ANGELES HOME WHICH IS LARGELY A SKILLED NURSING FACILITY AT THE HOSPITAL. THAT FILM CREW WENT IN THERE AND FILL IN THE TELEVISION SHOW. CLEARLY THAT IS SOMETHING THAT COULD BE JUST THERE AND IT COULD RISK VIOLATING THEIR PRIVACY SO WHY CALVET EVER PERMITTED THAT TO HAPPEN IS UNCLEAR. SO WE MADE SOME RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE LEGISLATURE ABOUT THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE WE RECOMMENDED THAT THE LEGISLATURE. REQUIRE CALVET TO INCORPORATE INTO REGULATION SPECIFIC CRITERIA ABOUT WHAT TYPES OF THESE USES CONSISTENT WITH THE BEST INTERESTS OF VETERANS IN THE HOME. THAT IT DENY ANY USES THAT ARE THAT DON'T MEET THAT CRITERIA. THAT IT ESTABLISH A FEE SCHEDULE FOR THOSE USES -- AND THEN IT REQUIRE WRITTEN AGREEMENTS THAT PROTECT THE INTERESTS OF THE STATE. SO THAT SUMS UP OUR KEY FINDINGS THAT WE MADE IN OUR AUDIT BUT WE'RE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU HAVE. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION AND KINDA LAYING. THE GROUND WORK IN THE FRAMEWORK FOR WHICH WE ARE WE ARE GOING OPERATE FROM -- OBVIOUSLY THERE'S A LOT OF ISSUES IDENTIFIED BUT I THINK WHAT I'LL DO IS I'LL DEFER -- TO MY COLLEAGUES AND I HAVE A LIST OF QUESTIONS AS WELL BUT LET ME AT THIS TIME WE ASK -- CENTER ARCHULETA FEW WANTS TO BEGIN -- HIS LINE OF QUESTIONING. THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION -- TRULY INFORMATIVE THANK YOU -- AND TROUBLING. NO DOUBT. OF IT IN YOUR REPORT YOU CALVET FAILED TO ENSURE THAT SIX HUNDRED AND TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS WAS APPROPRIATIONS HOW DO WE REACH THAT NUMBER. IN IS THAT NUMBER GROWING AS WE SIT HERE. AND IF WE DON'T TAKE ACTION IMMEDIATELY WILL IT GROW AND HOW CAN WE STOP. THANK YOU SENATOR -- SOME OF THE MONEY ACTUALLY HAS BEEN COLLECTED BY THE STATE SO WHEN I WAS REFERRING TO THE CALVET COLLECTED THREE HUNDRED NINETY ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS. DEPOSITED IN THE GENERAL FUND BUT DIDN'T NOTIFY FINANCE FOR THE LEGISLATURE'S THAT MONEY HAS BEEN COLLECTED BY CAL THAT ALSO THE DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL SERVICES COLLECTED ABOUT A HUNDRED AND EIGHTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS RELATED TO SOME OTHER LEASES -- THAT -- WE BELIEVE NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED BECAUSE THAT MONEY WAS COLLECTED HOWEVER DGSE TO POT AND NOT DEPOSITED IN THE GENERAL FUND THEY DEPOSITED IT IN A DIFFERENT FUND SO THAT NEEDS TO BE RECTIFIED. AND THEN THE LAST PIECE GETTING UP TO THE HUNDRED TO SIX HUNDRED TEN IS ABOUT A HUNDRED AND ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS. AND THAT IS FUNDS THAT I WAS REFERRING TO WHEN I TALKED ABOUT THE CONVENIENCE STORE AND THE GOLF COURSE OF THOSE ENTITIES HAD NOT PAID THE AMOUNTS DUE TO THE STATE SO THAT ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS. AGAIN AS IN A RECOMMENDATION WHERE WE BELIEVE CAL THAT NEEDS TO GET THAT GET THOSE FUNDS FROM THOSE TWO ENTITIES SO THERE'S A PIECE THE STATE IS ALREADY RECEIVEDAND THEN THERE'S A PIECE THAT THE STATE. NEEDS TO CONTINUE TO PURSUE -- FROM BOTH OF THOSE TWO ENTITIES AT YON PHIL. AND LET ME ASK YOU ONE OTHER THING ABOUT THE BOY APPLE LEASES IN THOSE WE SAT DOWN WITH THE THE ATTORNEYS AND ALSO MAY BE BROUGHT IN THE ENTITIES TO SEE IF WE COULD RE NEGOTIATE THEM. BECAUSE I WOULD THINK THAT THOSE IN THE OTHER SIDE WE'VE BEEN USING THE FACILITIES YEAR AFTER YEAR FOR DECADES -- WOULD BE WILLING TO SIT AT THE TABLE AND RE NEGOTIATE AND OBVIOUSLY SOME OF THESE LEASES SHOULD BE COMPLETELY AVOIDED OUT IN REACHED RENEGOTIATED IF THEY WISH. SO WHETHER CALVET CAN GET OUT OF THE LEAST DEPENDS ON THE LEASE SO ONE OF THEM IS THE POLICE THAT ONE'S VOID SO THAT WHEN THEY CAN GET OUT OF THERE ARE OTHERS THAT CONTAIN TERMINATION CLAUSES THAT ALLOW THEM TO TERMINATE AT WILL. WITH NOTICE TO THE TENANT BUT THERE ARE THREE LEASES THAT ARE -- FAR BEYOND THE FIVE YEAR TERM THEY DO NOT CONTAIN TERMINATION CLAUSE THAT ALLOW THE STATE TO TERMINATE FOR WHATEVER REASON THE WANT TO STAY AUTHOR MENTION WHERE THE HOUSE BECAUSE THE TENANT HAS TO BE IN BREACH OF THEIR AGREEMENT. AND THOSE ARE THE ONES THAT ARE GONNA BE TRICKY THAT'S THE MUSEUM THE THEATER. AND THE GOLF COURSE SO ONE OF OUR RECOMMENDATIONS ADDRESSES THIS IT SAYS TO CALVIN DDS THAT THEY NEED TO WORK TOGETHER TO TRY TO RENEGOTIATE ANY LEASES THAT ARE NOT CONSISTENT. WITH THE BEST INTEREST OF THE HOME OR THE VIOLATE STATE LAW SO THE EXTENT THAT WERE ABLE TO GET OF THOSE WILL BE TOTALLY UP TO WHATEVER THEY'RE ABLE TO NEGOTIATE WITH THE TENANTS. IN MY LAST QUESTION WAS CHAIR IS IN REFERENCE TO THE EMPLOYEE HOUSING -- RAISING THOSE RENTS AT 25% PER YEAR HAS ANYONE SAT DOWN WITH SOME THE TENANTS -- SLASH EMPLOYEES TO KNOW THAT IT'S COMING AT THE THIS MAY HAPPEN. YES MY UNDERSTANDING OF HOW THAT IS THAT THEY HAVE ALREADY STARTED THESE -- THEY'VE NOTICED ALL OF THE EMPLOYEES THAT THEY'RE GOING TO RAISE THE RENT NAY INTEND TO RAISE EVERYONE'S RENT BY 25% THANK YOU. WE JUST CONTINUE ON THAT LINE OF QUESTIONING THOSE ONE OF MY QUESTIONS AS WELL. IF WE INCREASED 25% TO HELP BRING IT BACK UP TO MARKET RATE VALUES HOW MANY YEARS DO WE NEED TO DO THIS TO GET TO MARKET RATE. SO IT DEPENDS ON THE INDIVIDUAL LEASE SO EACH LEASES VALID FOR A CERTAIN PERIOD OF TIME -- FOR SOME FOLKS THEY HAVE -- PRIORITY HOUSING IT MEANS THAT THEY CAN STAND THERE FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME. FOR OTHERS THEIR LEASES ONLY LIKE A YEAR LONG -- WHEN THE HOUSE CHANGES HANDS TEMAS EN CALVET CAN IMMEDIATELY CHARGE MARKET RENT SO FOR ANY HOMES WHERE THE TENANT LEAVES WE CAN DO THAT AUTOMATICALLY? IT'S THOSE WHERE THERE'S SOMEONE IN THE HOUSE RIGHT NOW THAT IT MIGHT TAKE A FEW YEARS BEFORE WE CAN GET IT TO MARKET RENT. AND IF THE GRAVEL ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS FROM ASSEMBLY WOMAN MEMBERS. IT'S JUST A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS SO -- THESE -- YOU LOOK AT ALL THE HOMES AND WE'RE REALLY FOCUSING ON YON PHIL SO IT IF THESE -- POLICIES OR LACK OF POLICIES ACROSS. DDS AND VETERAN AFFAIRS -- THAT -- CAL THAT. ARE -- ACROSS THE BOARD WHY DID WE WHY IS IT WHY ARE ALL THESE ISSUES FOCUSED AT YON PHIL. THE MAJORITY OF THE LEASES ARE YON PHIL THERE ONLY TO LEASES THAT WE REVIEW THAT WERE AT OTHER HOMES SO THERE'S A SALON IT FRESNO. AND A TELECOMMUNICATION FACILITY TO LIVE IS TO THERE'S AN ATM THERE AS WELL BUT ALL THE REST OF THE LEASES ARE AT THE OUT BILL HOME AND ALL OF THE EMPLOYEE HOUSING IS AT THE AMPLE HOME AND WHETHER IT ISSUES WITH THE OTHER LEASES. AB SO WE REVIEWED THE TELECOMMUNICATION FACILITY LEASE AND WE FOUND THAT. THE DURATION AT LEAST WAS. THERE'S AN EXCEPTION FOR OUR TELECOMMUNICATION FACILITIES IF THEY CAN BE TEN YEARS LONG AND LEASES TEN YEARS LONG. WE ALSO FOUND SOME EVIDENCE THE DS A CONSIDERED MARKET RENT FOR THAT FACILITY SO WE DIDN'T IDENTIFY ANY MAJOR ISSUES WITH THAT PARTICULAR LEASE. OKAY AND THEN -- I'M NOT SURE IF THIS IS A QUESTION FOR YOU OR TGS BUT WITH THE MUSEUM LEASE AGREEMENT IT DOESN'T STIPULATE WHAT HAPPENS. AFTER THE EXPIRATION OF THE FIFTY TWO AT LEAST IT DOES SPECIFY IF LEASES TERMINATED. OF FOR A TERM VIOLATIONS THE PROPERTY OF REVERTS BACK TO THE STATE BUT ELSEWHERE IT SAYS THAT -- LEASING MAY TRANSFER THE PROPERTY WITH THE STATE'S APPROVAL TO OTHER -- PARTIES CAN YOU CLARIFY WHAT ACTUALLY WILL HAPPEN TO THE PROPERTY AFTER FIFTY TWO YEARS OR DO WE NEED TO ASK TGS FOR THAT OR IS THERE NO ANSWER I I THINK THAT'S A QUESTION FOR DTS THANK YOU. I HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS AND THEN WE'LL MOVE TO OTHER MEMBERS -- YOU KNOW MISS HOW. YOU KNOW THANK YOU FOR FOR PRESENTING THE THREE KEY AREAS IT ANY SUCH AGREEMENTS COLLECTING REVENUE STATE STATE -- LIABILITY -- I'M JUST GONNA CONTINUE FIRST WITH THE LINE OF QUESTIONING MISTER WHEN HAD IN TERMS OF LIKE THE LEASES. SO WE IDENTIFIED THREE LONG TERM LEASES ON I'M SORRY YOUR COLLEAGUE. I DON'T HAVE THE AGENDA FOR ME. AMANDA MAILING A MAN MANTA MILLEN -- YOU IDENTIFIED IN THE GOLF THE GOLF COURSE FOR INSTANCE THAT -- THERE MIGHT POSSIBLY BE A BREACH BECAUSE A PERCENTAGE OF THE CELLS TO NOT GO BACK TO THE VETERAN SO TO ME THAT'S LAS REVENUE -- FOR THE MORALE FUND AND WHATEVER ELSE VETERANS NEED WOULD THAT BE SOMETHING. A LEGAL STANDING FOR THE STATE ACTUALLY RE NEGOTIATE THAT LEASE -- SO LET ME ADD A LITTLE BIT MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE GOLF COURSE PERCENTAGE RENT PAYMENTS THE GOLF COURSE HAD BEEN MAKING PERCENTAGE RENT PAYMENTS EVERY YEAR. THE REASON WHY CALVET DIDN'T COLLECT THE FULL AMOUNT OF PERCENTAGE RENT IS BECAUSE CALVET HAD NOT. CALCULATED THE AMOUNT THAT THE GOLF COURSE ACTUALLY NEEDED TO PAY. TO DETERMINE THAT THE GOLF COURSE HAD PAID ENOUGH AND SO IT WAS REALLY CAL THAT FAULT THAT THEY WEREN'T COLLECTING THE TOTAL AMOUNT. ON THAT -- THEY ARE. THEY HAVEN'T PAID THE FULL AMOUNT THAT WAS DUE BUT I THINK MISTER DAWSON. WEIGH IN ON WHETHER THERE HI CHRIS FOR DAWSON -- SEEN -- AS MISS KNOWN WAS INDICATING THAT WAS A COLLECTION ISSUE AND WE DIDN'T NEED WE DIDN'T ANALYZE IT IN THE SENSE THAT IT WOULD BE A BREACH I THINK THAT'S A QUESTION FOR TGS COUNCIL. CON. ALL RIGHT WELL THANK YOU -- YOU KNOW YOU HAD MENTIONED ALSO IN YOUR PRESENTATION. THE LENGTH. OF THE THE LEASES YOU KNOW IN A LOT OF THEM ARE NOT TO EXCEED FIVE YEARS BUT IN YOUR FINDINGS DID YOU HOW MANY LEASES ACTUALLY EXCEEDED FIVE YEARS I KNOW WE'VE TALKED ABOUT. YOU KNOW THE SERMON MENTIONED A FIFTY TWO YEAR LEASE FOR THE MUSEUM FOR INSTANCE BUT HOW MANY OF THOSE THE LEASES ACTUALLY EXCEEDED FIVE YEARS. SO AS I MENTIONED EARLIER THERE WERE TWO LEASES THAT EXCEEDED FIVE YEARS BUT COULD -- SO ONE OF THOSE IS TELECOMMUNICATIONS FACILITY THE TEN YEAR LEASE AND THEN THERE'S A FIRE STATION THAT'S TWENTY FIVE YEARS. AND THAT IS PERMITTED UNDER EXCEPTION THAT ALLOWS -- FACILITIES THAT ARE USED IN EMERGENCY RESPONSE. THERE WERE FOUR OTHER LEASES THAT EXCEEDED FIVE YEARS THAT DID NOT HAVE SUCH AN EXCEPTION THOSE ARE THE THREE THAT YOU MENTIONED THE MUSEUM THE GOLF COURSE AND THE LINCOLN THEATRE -- BUT THERE IS ALSO A FIRE TRAINING FACILITY A FIREFIGHTER TRAINING FACILITY THAT HAS A TWENTY FIVE YEAR LEASE BUT IS NOT DOES NOT HAVE AN AUTHORIZATION TO DO THAT -- AND THAT ONE DOES HAVE A TERMINATION CLAUSE THOUGH. THAT ONE ALLOWS THE STATE TO TERMINATE THE LEASE WITH A YEAR'S NOTICE. OKAY. AND FOR THE LEASES THAT WE'RE PAYING NO RENT IS -- TERMINATION CLAUSES AND THOSE OR HE MENTIONED LIKE NAPA. VALLEY COLLEGE FOR INSTANCE AND SOME OF THE OTHERS. RIGHT THEY DON'T HAVE AGREEMENTS -- SO. TO WHAT IF THAT THAT WAS OUR MAIN CONCERN WAS THAT IN FACT THEY WERE. OCCUPYING SPACE OUT THE HOME WITH NO WRITTEN AGREEMENT WHICH EXPOSES THE STATE. TO POSSIBLE LIABILITY AND ALSO THERE IS THE LOSS OF THE REVENUE THAT THEY OUGHT TO BE COLLECTED. TO THE STATE ASSUMES ALL THE LIABILITY BUT THE SOURCES. THAT IS CORRECT [inaudible] OKAY. LET ME JUST ASK A GENERAL QUESTION JUST BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE. OF THE AUDITOR'S OFFICE IS LOOKED AT THIS SINCE I KNOW SINCE TWENTY THIRTEEN FOR INSTANCE. AND THEN WE HAD THE ADDITIONAL ARMOR TO FINANCE NOW LAST YEAR'S OUT OF THE CAME OUT IN OUR EARLIER JANUARY. WHAT PROGRESS HAVE YOU SEEN FROM THE OLD OUT ITS TO THE NEW WHAT IT AND WATER AREAS WE SHOULD BE FOCUSING ON IN TERMS OF MOVING FORWARD? AND MR ONE HAS LEGISLATION YOU'VE -- REFER REFERENCED IT A COUPLE OF TIMES AS WELL IN TERMS OF MAYBE NEEDING MORE OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY. IN TERMS OF THE CRITERIA IS IN THE REGULATIONS BUT JUST FROM TWENTY THIRTEEN TO TO NOW. WHICH PROBLEMS ARE STILL THE SAME. AND IF YOU JUST COMMENT ON THAT PLACE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR IT IS SOME OF THE ISSUES RELATED TO THE AGREEMENTS THE LANGUAGE IN THE AGREEMENTS OF THE LENGTH OF THE AGREEMENTS ARE SIMILAR. CERTAINLY THE ISSUE WE IDENTIFIED IN THE INVESTIGATIVE REPORT WE WE PUBLISHED BACK IN TWENTY THIRTEEN WAS. DECISIONS WERE BEING MADE AT THE YOUNG BILL HOME THAT HEADQUARTERS WASN'T AWARE OF ONE'S HEAD QUARTERS BECAME AWARE OF IT THEY CEASE AND DESIST AND THAT'S WHY THE STATE HAD TO NEGOTIATE. AND PAY THE VENDOR -- I'M A LITTLE OVER TWO AND A I THINK THE DIFFERENCE WE'RE SEEING TODAY AND THAT'S WHY I WANTED TO MAKE SURE I I COMMENTED IN AND MY PRESENTATION IS. THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION -- MEMBER -- HAS REALLY -- IN SOME WAYS TRY TO GET AHEAD OF THE AUDIT SINCE THE ON IT WAS APPROVED THEY WERE OUT OF THE DIFFERENT FACILITIES TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT ROPERTIES ARE RELEASING. HOW MANY LEASES THE WE HAVE ONE OF THE TERMS OF THOSE LEASES ETCETERA REALLY TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE NATURE OF THE CONDITIONS OUT OF THE VARIOUS FACILITIES? NOW WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER IF THEY HAD KNOWN THAT PRIOR TO AN AUDIT BEING REQUESTED APPROVED -- BUT I ALSO THINK THAT AS I SAID THERE WERE SOME STEPS THAT AS WE BROUGHT ISSUES TO THE ATTENTION OF THE ADMINISTRATION -- THEY JUST TRIED TO RECTIFY SOME OF THOSE ISSUES LIKE I SAID THEY DEVELOPED A POLICY IN MAY OF EIGHTEEN THEIR ADOPTING THE KELLY CHAR POLICY. THEY DEVELOPED A POLICY IN DECEMBER OF EIGHTEEN THAT WAS DISTRIBUTED TO THE ADMINISTRATORS -- WITH RESPECT TO MAKING SURE THEY COME UP WITH CRITERIA. AS FAR AS IDENTIFYING WHAT WHAT. BEST INTEREST OF THE HOME MEANS WHAT KIND OF CRITERIA IN MINISTRY TO SHOULD BE CONSIDERING BUT I ALSO SEE A DIFFERENCE IN THIS PARTICULAR AUDIT OR RESPONSE TO THIS AUDIT. WHERE THE ADMINISTRATION IS SAYING WE WANT TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR EMPLOYEE HOUSING WE ARE GOING TO BE MAKING DECISIONS AT THE AGENCY SECRETARY LEVEL THE DEPARTMENT BUT THE AGENCY SECRETARY OR HIS DESIGNATE WILL BE INVOLVED IN SOME OF THESE DECISIONS SO? I THINK THAT WE'RE SEEING -- PROGRESS WITH RESPECT IN THIS PARTICULAR ENTITY THAT'S AND NOTICED RESPECT TO PRIOR ADMINISTRATIONS BUT I SEE A DIFFERENCE -- AS I SAID A LOT OF TIMES WHENEVER WE CONDUCT AN AUDIT WE'RE SHARING INFORMATION WITH AN ENTITY TO GIVE THEM THE OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE CORRECTIVE ACTION AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE AND WILL GIVE HIM CREDIT FOR THE REPORT. LOT OF TIMES YOU DON'T SEE THAT OUR OUR REPORTS IN THIS PARTICULAR REPORT YES THE AGENCY STARTED FIXING THINGS. WHAT I AM HOPING TO SEE AND AND WHEN WE GET OUR SIXTY DAY RESPONSE WHICH IS DUE THE END OF THIS MONTH -- AND THEN OUR SIX MONTH IS THAT THE ONE THAT WE REALLY USE AS A BELLWETHER AS FAR AS HAS THIS AGENCY REALLY TAKEN THE RECOMMENDATION SERIOUSLY AND GOTTEN SOME THINGS DONE. SO I'M HOPING BY THE SIX MONTH RESPONSE WE'LL SEE A LOT OF THESE POLICIES FINALIZED SOME OF THE DISCUSSIONS BETWEEN DTS AND CAL THAT FINALIZED AS FAR AS WHAT IS GOING TO BE THE CRITERIA. FOR DETERMINING WHEN WE SHOULD LEASE PROPERTY OUT WHAT TERM SHOULD BE IN THAT IN THE LANGUAGE OF THOSE LEASES WHO SHOULD BE APPROVING THOSE LEASES HEADQUARTERS NEEDS TO BE AWARE OF WHAT'S HAPPENING AT THE VARIOUS HOME SO. THERE THERE WERE SOME SIMILARITIES TO PRIOR -- REVIEWS TWENTY THIRTEEN I MEAN THERE WAS AN AUDIT -- AS FAR BACK AS TWO THOUSAND AND THREE WHEN WE LOOKED AT EMPLOYEE HOUSING AT A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS AND HAD THIS ISSUE AND AND I LOOKED AT THAT THIS MORNING AND CAL THAT WAS IN THERE. BUT I DO THINK THAT THERE IS. A DIFFERENT RESPONSE TO THIS PART THE CURRENT. THANK YOU ON IN THE WHEN CAL THAT COMES UP THE COMMENT ON THIS AS WELL. AND SO PRETTY THAT AT THIS TIME WHEN WE SEE IF THERE'S ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS SO WE WILL MOVE -- TO SO THEY'RE MORE LIKE FIRST. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU MICHELLE FOR ANOTHER FIND. REPORT [inaudible] ADAM. THE THOUGHT CAME TO MIND WHEN I WAS READING THEM WHAT A WAY TO RUN A RAILROAD. JUST LIKE. GET FRUSTRATED SO HERE IN OUR BECOMING OUT OF CAR KELLY GOVERNMENT AND CITY GOVERNMENT YOU HAVE A CITY MANAGER IN A COUNTY EXECUTIVE OFFICER BUDGET. I DON'T SEE AN END SACRAMENTO IT CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER OR A CEO. BUT I DO SEE SECRETARIES ARE JUST CURIOUS. ON THE ORGANIZATIONAL CHART WHO DOES CALVET REPORT TO AND WHO IS D. G. S. REPORT -- TO CALVET I MEAN IT'S AN IT'S AN AGENCY LEVEL POSITION -- SO REPORTS TO THE CABINET SAID -- DIRECTLY -- AND THEN D. G. S. IS UNDER I THINK IT'S USED TO BE STE. KEN DEVOPS CEASE TO BE STATE CONSUMER SERVE THEIR UNDER -- GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS AGENCY IN THAT AGENCY SECRETARY REPORTS TO CABINET. THE NEW GOVERNING SOME SO THEN. IS THERE A BETTER WAY TO RUN SOME OF THESE DEPARTMENTS -- PORT CHARGES LOW IS IS THAT A RHETORICAL QUESTION. NO CENTER I DON'T. COME OUT OF AN EXECUTIVE FOR SESSIONS AND I'M IN LEGISLATIVE SO NOW YOU'RE LIKE WHAT THREE MINUTES TO ASK YOU A QUESTION. AND AND AND BUT I'M LOOKING FOR SOLUTIONS RIGHT BECAUSE THIS IS EMBARRASSING STUFF. AND IT'S LIKE. MANAGEMENT FAILURE SO NOW WHAT WE DO. YOU KNOW IT IS HURT A WAY TO IMPROVE THIS WITH A C. O. O. POSITION SOMEONE WHO COULD. SAY WHAT YOU'RE YOU'RE SHORT STAFFED OR YOU DON'T HAVE THE PROPER TRAINING WHAT WE'LL GET SOMEONE IN THERE FROM ANOTHER DEPARTMENT BECAUSE THEY'RE THEY'RE OVERSTAFFED. WERE WERE WHATEVER. AND I DON'T SEE THAT MECHANISM OR THAT OPPORTUNITY. SO I'M JUST CURIOUS IF YOU EVER TRY TO LOOK AT THE THIRTY THOUSAND FOOT LEVEL AND SAID BOY HERE SOME IDEAS THAT WOULD. PREVENT. SOME OF THESE EMBARRASSING MANAGEMENT [inaudible] MISTAKES. WELL AND AND AND SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE DONE IN THE PAST AS AN AS A THE STATE AUDITOR'S OFFICE IN WORKING WITH YOU KNOW I'VE WORKED WITH FOR FIVE DIFFERENT ADMINISTRATIONS NOW. IS BRIEFING THE AGENCY SECRETARIES. OF THE ISSUES WE'VE IDENTIFIED IN AUDITS -- I'VE OFFERED THAT TO EVERY ADMINISTRATION OF ALREADY MET WITH THE NEW ADMINISTRATION -- THEY'RE VERY ATTENTIVE AND WANTING TO UNDER WE'VE IDENTIFIED IN THE PAST AND REALLY WANTING TO KNOW ARE THE AGENCIES BEING RESPONSIVE ARE THE DEPARTMENT'S BEING RESPONSIVE TO YOUR YOUR RECOMMENDATION SO I THINK THAT WILL HELP. BUT I THINK THAT IT'S IT'S REALLY KEY AT THE CABINET LEVEL SO FOR EXAMPLE GOVERNMENT OFFICE HAS A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS. THAT REPORTS TO IT. INDEED YES IS ONE OF THEM THERE ARE OTHERS SO WHAT WHAT'S HAPPENING AT THAT AGENCY LEVEL FOR THAT AGENCY TO REALLY UNDERSTAND. NOT JUST ISSUES AT THE STATE AUDITOR'S OFFICE RAISES BUT IF THERE ARE ISSUES RELATED TO BUDGET OR OTHER YOU KNOW -- PROGRAM A LOT OF THESE DEPARTMENTS HAVE INTERNAL AUDIT SHOPS ARE THEY PAYING ATTENTION TO THE REVIEWS THAT THEIR OWN INTERNAL AUDITORS ARE DOING. I THINK AND AND YOU KNOW I DON'T I MEAN AUDITOR'S TYPICALLY ARE SKEPTICS AND AND VERY CRITICAL. BUT I DO REALLY WANT TO SAY THAT. THE THE CURRENT AGENCY SECRETARY OF VETERANS AFFAIRS HE REACHED OUT TO ME AS SOON AS A SITE WAS APPROVED YOU HAVE MY FULL COOPERATION I WANT YOU TO KNOW WE'RE GOING TO BE OUT THERE THESE HOMES GETTING AHEAD OF THIS WERE ALREADY TRYING TO IDENTIFY. WHAT LEASES WE HAVE -- AND AND I DON'T KNOW I AM NOT TO SPEAK FOR HIM TO SAY HE WAS EMBARRASSED NOT TO BE ABLE TO NOW BUT HE WANTED TO GET ON TOP OF IT RIGHT AWAY AND I THINK. THE FACT THAT WE HAVE A EXAMPLES IN THE REPORT WHERE THEY ARE IMMEDIATELY TAKING CORRECTIVE ACTION NOT WAITING FOR REPORT TO BE ISSUED AND THEN REACTING TO IT THEY ARE REACTING TO THE FEEDBACK. IMMEDIATELY AND AND AND I BELIEVE IT'S ONLY FAIR. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU FOR THE SUMMER GONNA MOVE TO ASSEMBLY WOMAN -- PEACHY NORRIS AND THEN WE'LL MOVE TO CENTER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. A GOOD MORNING THANKS FOR BEING HERE. A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT. TAKE ON PERHAPS THIS IS THE SAME -- THE SAME POINT WHICH IS NOT AS MR SALAS NOTED THIS INCREASE BEEN GOING ON FOR SOME TIME THE ISSUES THAT. NOTED IN THE REPORT HAD BEEN GOING ON FOR SOME TIME HOW CAN WE AS LEGISLATORS. BE MORE EFFECTIVE IN MORE QUICKLY IDENTIFYING AND RECTIFYING THESE TYPES OF PROBLEMS WHETHER IT'S YOU KNOW IN CAL THAT SIR IT IN OTHER DEPARTMENTS. AGAIN THAT'S A AYE AYE I THINK THERE'S A VARIETY OF OF OVERSIGHT OPPORTUNITIES THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS CERTAINLY THROUGH THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE AUDIT COMMITTEE VARIOUS POLICY COMMITTEES THE TO VETERANS AFFAIRS COMMITTEES -- OF HAVING THIS JOINT HEARING TODAY I THINK AND BUDGET SUB COMMITTEES THERE CAN BE QUESTIONS ASKED IN THE PAST MY OFFICE OFTENTIMES WOULD TESTIFY IT BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE HEARINGS -- IF A DEPARTMENTS BUDGET WAS UP HE ASKED TO PRESENT HAVE YOU DONE AUDITS OF THE DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS IN THE LAST THREE YEARS. AND ARE YOU FEELING LIKE THE RECOMMENDATIONS ARE BEING FULLY IMPLEMENTED OR NOT AND IN SOME CASES IF THEY'RE NOT THEN THE MEMBERS WOULD QUESTION THE DEPARTMENT. YOU'RE ASKING FOR MORE RESOURCES BUT THE AUDITOR IS SAYING YOU'RE NOT EVEN DOING X. Y. AND Z. THAT HER OFFICE SUGGESTED. SO I THINK THERE ARE A VARIETY OF MECHANISMS THAT THE LEGISLATURE. CAN USE -- TO EXERCISE ITS OVERSIGHT AND AND RESPONSIBILITIES AND AUTHORITY CERTAINLY -- THE OTHER ISSUE THAT WE IDENTIFY IN SOME REPORTS AND I AND I GOING TO HAVE TO HAVE. AMANDA ASSIST US BUT I THINK THERE ARE CERTAIN REPORTS THAT DEPARTMENTS HAVE TO PROVIDE TO THE LEGISLATURE -- AND MAKING SURE THAT THE REPORTS AND I KNOW YOU GET A LOT OF INFORMATION BUT ARE THERE KEY THINGS THAT THE LEGISLATURE'S CONCERNED ABOUT -- AND THAT IT WE TRY TO TAKE THAT -- SERIOUSLY AS FAR AS WE DON'T WANT TO OVERLOAD MEMBERS BECAUSE WELL BELIEVE ME I'M FULLY AWARE OF HOW BUSY ALL OF YOU ARE BUT ARE THEY ARE KEY ELEMENTS OR OF INFORMATION THAT VARIOUS DEPARTMENTS SHOULD BE PROVIDING TO THE LEGISLATURE. AND AND IN SOME CASES WILL MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS LIKE CAN BE CALLING THAT INFORMATION AND BRINGING CERTAIN THINGS TO YOUR ATTENTION. THANK YOU BUT THIS TIME I SHOULD NOTE THAT WE DO HAVE TO ADDITIONAL -- MEMBERS THAT HAVE BEEN INVITED TO JOIN US AT TODAY'S HEARING THAT IS -- SENATOR BILL DODD AND ALSO ASSEMBLY WOMAN CECILIA AGUIAR-CURRY THIS TIME WILL MOVE TO SENATOR DOT. OP THANK YOU BYE I'D LIKE TO THANK THE CHAIRS A J. LIKE IN THE VETERANS COMMITTEE FOR ALLOWING. ME TO BE HERE TODAY -- TO BECAUSE I THINK THOSE ARE INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT HEARING -- I DO HAVE SOME PREPARED REMARKS BECAUSE I I REALLY THINK THAT SOME OF THIS -- NEEDS TO BE PUT INTO CONTEXT AND I HOPE THAT THIS IS HELPFUL. FIRST OF ALL AS A SENATOR REPRESENTING THE YACHT BILL THAT'S HOME THE CARE THE RESIDENTS IMPROPER MANAGEMENT OF THE FACILITY. IS OF UTMOST IMPORTANT TO ME -- THE YOUR BILL VETERANS HOME HAS BEEN AN INCREDIBLY ENORMOUS ASSET FOR VETERANS -- FOR WELL OVER A CENTURY IT'S BEEN A CRITICAL PARTNER -- TO THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITIES OF THE TOWN OF YACHT BILL AND THE BROADER NAPA VALLEY. WITH PROPER MANAGEMENT AND INVESTMENT I KNOW IT WILL CONTINUE TO MEET THOSE NEEDS -- FOR THROUGH FOR THE NEXT CENTURY. WHAT'S CLEAR TIME HASN'T PROVIDED THE LEVEL OF DILIGENCE AND OVERSIGHT WE EXPECT FROM ALL OUR STATE DEPARTMENTS WITH RESPECT TO THE EVENTS IN LEASES. I DO FEEL HOWEVER THAT THE AUDIT OVERLOOK SOME OF THE BENEFITS. OF THE VARIOUS LEASES -- TO PROVIDE HOME RESIDENTS IN. THE CAPITAL INVESTMENTS MADE BY GROUPS TO BUILD RENOVATE OR MAINTAIN BUILDINGS AND AFTER LISTENING -- TO THIS IS MISS HOUSE -- TESTIMONY I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT SAY AT THIS POINT I PERHAPS -- THEY WOULD'VE IF THEY'VE BEEN. YOU KNOW PUT IN THE LEASES WHAT THE BENEFITS WORSE I APPRECIATE -- THAT CONTACTS BUT I THINK THAT THE THAT NEW ONCE IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE CERTAINLY NOBODY'S GOING TO BUILD A GOLF COURSE. OR BUILDING MUSEUM. OR SIGNIFICANTLY INPUT MILLIONS OF DOLLARS INTO A THEATER FOR A FIVE YEAR LEASE. SO IMMEDIATELY THERE'S GOT TO BE SOMETHING IN THERE THAT ALLOWS FOR A INVESTMENTS FROM THE COMMUNITY WORKS VOWED TO BE -- APPROPRIATE USE AND ALL ULTIMATELY BENEFIT VETERANS THE IT IN THAT REGARD. AND I THINK -- THAT'S WHERE THE PRESENTATION WAS. FOR THE BEST INTERESTS OF THE HOMES. LONG TERM AND WHETHER OR NOT -- THESE LEASES. AND THE AMOUNT OF RENT IS ACTUALLY COMING BACK TO BENEFIT THE VETERANS THEMSELVES AND SO I BELIEVE THAT WAS AN ISSUE IDENTIFIED SO FULLY. TO TO THAT POINT MISTER DOT YEAH I PERSONALLY GOT MISTER CHAIR AND I THINK THAT -- REASONABLE PROCESS AND CRITERIA FOR THESE LEASES ANY BETTER. PERMITS I THINK ARE IMPORTANT -- TO TO TO MAKE SURE THAT -- NOT ONLY THAT -- LOOK IT JUST GOES DOWN THIS WAY THEY ARE PART OF THE COMMUNITY IT USED TO BE LIKE WHEN I GREW UP. THE ONLY TIME WE EVER SAW VETERANS WITH THE PEOPLE WENT TO THE LOCAL BARS IN THE TOWN OF YOUR BILL AND THAT WAS IT. AND I TELL YOU TODAY IT IS A MUCH DIFFERENT SITUATION THERE MEMBERS OF OUR CENTRAL COMMITTEES THEY'RE INVOLVED IN SO MANY COMMUNITY EVENTS AND IT THING SO SOME OF THESE THINGS LIKE THE THEATER. AND THESE OTHER THINGS WERE A MAJOR INVESTMENTS ARE GOING ON WE JUST HAVE TO HAVE SOME -- COMMON SENSE PREVAIL. TO TO YOUR POINT IF IT'S JUST PUT IN THE LEAST AND SHOWN THE BENEFITS THAT'S PROBABLY -- WHAT YOU NEED GOING FORWARD? BUT I I MY POINT IS WE CAN'T HAVE THE PENDULUM SWINGING FROM LAX OVERSIGHT TO SIMPLY SHUTTING DOWN THE COMMUNITY. THE VETERANS HOME -- AT THE HOME -- WE WILL NOT BE THE VETERANS AT THE HOME WILL NOT BENEFIT BY BEINGS WALLED OFF FROM THE COMMUNITY AND THE TAXPAYERS NAPA VALLEY WILL NOT BENEFIT. FROM BEING BARRED FROM OF THE CAMPUS. FOR EXAMPLE THERE'S AN ANNUAL BIKE RACE THAT HAPPENS EVERY SINGLE YEAR THEY RAISE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS FOR VETERANS. FOR VETERANS NOW THAT WASN'T IN THE LEAST MAYBE THERE WASN'T EVEN A YOU KNOW AS A CONTRACTOR AND I GET THAT. BUT THIS WHAT I'M JUST CONCERNED ABOUT IS THE PENDULUM SWINGING YOUR THE WRONG WAY AND ALL THE SUDDEN MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITY WHO HERETOFORE HAVE BEEN. MAJOR PROPONENTS OF THE VETERANS HOME AND SUPPORTERS THROUGHOUT THE COMMUNITY GET TURNED OFF TO THE STATE TURNED OFF THE VETERANS WHICH IS YOU KNOW EVEN WORSE THESE PEOPLE THAT SERVED -- ON BEHALF OF OF THEIR COUNTRY BUT I THINK IT'LL BE WE NEED A COLLABORATIVE PROCESS TO GET CD DA WE'RE NEEDS TO BE. AND I LOOK FORWARD YOU ARE PARTNERING AN IDEA ON THIS ISSUE AND JUST WANTED TO MAKE THOSE POINT TONIGHT THANK YOU ALL FOR BEING HERE TODAY AND ANSWERING THESE QUESTIONS. RIGHT TAKE SENATOR DODD FOR THOSE -- COMMENTS I KNOW YOU KNOW. THIS COMMITTEE IN THE OBJECTIVE OF THE HEARING IS REALLY TO GET OUT THE RECOMMENDATIONS AND FIGURE OUT WAYS THAT WE CAN. FURTHER BENEFIT VETERANS HOW CAN WE DO THAT RESPONSIBLE YET OTHERS SOME GOOD PROGRAMS ARE HAPPENING OUT THERE BUT YOU KNOW WHAT'S A LIABILITY THE STATE IF THEY ARE MAKING A LOT OF MONEY SAY FOR INSTANCE. FOR THE EVENT YOU IDENTIFIED MORE THEY PAYING A LOT IS A STATE ASSUMING A LIABILITY FOR THAT OR SHOULD THEY BE. PAYING THEIR FAIR SHARE AS WELL SO THAT THEY CAN CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD AND AND BE PROSPEROUS AND THEN ACTUALLY BENEFIT -- EVERYONE CAN MOVE AND LET ME BE CLEAR I THINK THAT THERE SHOULD BE NO LIABILITY. ON BEHALF OF THE STATE I SUPPORT THE RECOMMENDATIONS -- IT I THINK ANYBODY WITH ANY COMMON SENSE. WOULD SAY THAT IF THE IF YOU'VE GOT A LEASE I MEAN JUST IF IT HAPPENS EVERYDAY BUSINESS YOU DO NOT WANT THE LIABILITY IF YOU'RE GONNA LEAVE SOMETHING OUT AND YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE. THOSE DISCLAIMERS TO MAKE SURE THAT SOMEBODY'S GOT INSURANCE NAME IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AS THE BENEFICIARY IN THE EVENT. OF A PROBLEM THANK YOU. THE SAME WAY THAT WE WE HAVE QUESTIONS FROM ASSEMBLY MEMBER BROUGHT WE'VE DONE SOME STUFF IN MY DISTRICT ALWAYS PRE APPRECIATE YOUR PROFESSIONALISM. JUST ONE SIMPLE QUESTION DID YOU IDENTIFY ANY INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE INVOLVED IN THESE DECISIONS AND IF SO WHO ARE THEY OR WHO ARE THEY AND DO YOU THINK THERE'S ANY DISCIPLINE ACTIONS THAT NEED TO TAKE PLACE. M.. SO WITH REGARD TO FOR INSTANCE THE FOR ENTITIES THAT WERE OCCUPYING SPACE IN THE HOME -- IT WAS APPARENT TO US THAT THOSE ENTITIES HAD. TAKEN UP RESIDENCE DURING A TIME. BEFORE ANY OF THE CURRENT FOLKS. THAT ARE AT THE HOME WHERE THERE SO THEY ARE NO LONGER WITH CAL THAT -- SOME OF THESE LEASES GO BACK A VERY LONG TIME. EVEN BACK TO NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT SO A LOT OF THE PEOPLE AT CALVIN TGS WHO OVERSAW SOME OF THESE AGREEMENTS ARE THERE ANYMORE. AS A RESULT WHEN WE WERE ASKING CAL THAT DDS WHY DID THESE THINGS HAPPEN WHY DID DDS CAL THAT MAKE THESE DECISIONS THEY WEREN'T REALLY ABLE TO PROVIDE ANSWERS. BECAUSE THEY JUST WEREN'T THE PEOPLE WHO WERE AROUND AT THAT TIME. THANKS VERY MUCH. AND I WANTED TO ADD TO THAT. MR BREAUX THERE WERE. A COUPLE OF INDIVIDUALS WITH RESPECT TO THE HOUSING -- WHO MAY WERE MAKING ARRANGEMENTS TO THEIR OWN BENEFIT -- THE THE CAL THAT HAD HIRED A STATE ASSET. USE ME MANAGER AND THERE WAS ALSO A DEPUTY ADMINISTRATOR ONCE CALVET BECAME AWARE OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES AROUND THE INAPPROPRIATE HOUSING BENEFITS FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS -- AS WE SAY IN THE REPORT CAL THAT TOOK SWIFT ACTION TERMINATED BOTH INDIVIDUALS. THANK YOU I THINK WE HAVE A QUESTION 4% ARCH LETTER THEN WE'RE GONNA MOVE TO ASSEMBLY WOMAN OCCURS. YOU MISTER CHAIR OF I WOULD HOPE THAT ONE RECOMMENDATION WOULD BE THAT MAY BE AN ANNUAL. A CURSORY AUDIT. TEAMING UP WITH THE THE DID THE DEPARTMENT OF COURSE WITH THE WITH THE SECRETARY AND AND JUST TO MAKE IT A FRIENDLY VISIT JUST TO SEE HOW THINGS ARE GOING ALONG. SO WHEN WE TO PREVENT THIS SORT OF THING AND IF WE KNOW PROGRESS IS MADE AND I APPRECIATE YOUR STAND IN YOUR AND JUST FEELING -- THAT THE SECTOR IS DOING THE RIGHT THING AND I APPRECIATE THAT AND I FEEL THE SAME WAY. OF AND IT IS MY COLLEAGUE HAD MENTIONED WE HAVE A COMMUNITY WHOSE HONORING VETERANS IN WORKING -- WITH OUR VETERANS WE WANT TO BRING EVERYONE TOGETHER BUT IT IS A BUSINESS TO BUSINESS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND UNDER THAT WE HAVE LIABILITY ISSUES AND CONCERNS CHAU -- IF YOU COULD PUT SOMETHING TOGETHER AND AND MAYBE GET WITH THE SECTARIAN CHIEF YOU COULD COME TO AN AGREEMENT TO SEE ONE ANOTHER EVERY YEAR -- UNDER FRIENDLY BASIS SEE HOW THINGS ARE MOVING ALONG I THINK THAT WOULD BE A STEP FORWARD. AND I APPRECIATE THANK YOU. THANK YOU BY THE SEVERAL MOVED ASSEMBLYWOMAN AGUIAR-CURRY HI AGAIN GOOD MORNING AND THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE PART -- IT'S REALLY SHOWED A LOT OF THINGS THAT WE'VE THOUGHT ABOUT THIS FOR A LONG TIME AND I'VE MET WITH -- THE OF A RESIDENTS THERE I'VE HAD PUBLIC OUTREACH MEETINGS MYSELF AND SENATOR DODD CONGRESSMAN THOMPSON WE'VE HAD THESE CONVERSATIONS WE'VE HAD PEOPLE FROM THE AGENCIES THERE. AND I'VE HEARD CRICKETS. AND I APPRECIATE WERE GOING RIGHT NOW AND I'M GONNA BE VERY INVOLVED IN MAKING SURE THAT EVERYBODY FOLLOWS THROUGH. WITHOUT BEING SAID IS THAT RIGHT NOW THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE DOING A CALVET MASTER PLAN FOR YOUNG FILL. I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT MASTER PLAN IS BEING DONE AND I WOULD APPRECIATE THAT THE YOUR RECOMMENDATIONS ARE INCORPORATED INTO THAT MASTER PLAN -- I AM REQUESTING A DRAFT OF THAT MASTER PLAN BECAUSE EVERY SINGLE TIME I HAVE A MEETING THEY SAID WE HAVE TO WAIT FOR THE MASTER PLAN WE NEED TO WAIT FOR THE ON IT. I CAN'T LET THOSE VETERANS WAITING THE LONGER. AND I REFUSED TO LET THEM WAIT ANY LONGER. QUITE FRANKLY I WAS THERE WITH THE EIGHTY YEAR OLD GENTLEMAN WITH NO HEAT IN HIS ROOM THAT'S WRONG THE ELEVATOR DOESN'T WORK. THAT'S WRONG THESE FUNDS SHOULD HAVE BEEN REACHED EVER WAS NOT WATCHING WHERE THEM FUNDS WERE GOING I'M APPALLED I'M SO ANGRY RIGHT NOW SO. I WANTED TO I THANK YOU FOR THIS THIS IS GOING TO GIVE US A ROADMAP TO DO THE RIGHT THING. THAT COMMUNITY THAT NAPA VALLEY CHERISH THESE PEOPLE AND THAT CENTER. AND WE WANT TO MAKE IT BETTER AND I THINK OTHERS COME TRUE COMMITMENT FOR MYSELF AND CENTER JOB COUNTY -- THE COUNTY SUPERVISORS EVERYONE TO GET THE BACK ON THEIR FEET THE TOWN A YOUNG BILL HAS LOST SO MUCH OUT OF THIS IF SOMETHING HAPPENED SO -- WE HAVE THIS BEAUTIFUL MUSEUM THIS THERE WE'LL TALK ABOUT FAIR MARKET VALUE AND HOW THAT ALL WORKED OUT BECAUSE THAT DOES NOT MAKE SENSE TO ME FOR THEM AT ALL. BUT THOSE ARE THE THINGS THAT I I WANT TO TELL YOU IS THAT THIS IS NOT BEEN JUST FROM THIS REPORT THIS IS FOR A WHILE AND WHEN YOU SAY THAT SINCE. TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN THEY'VE HAD A LOT OF AND REALLY NOTHING HAS HAPPENED UNTIL THEY HEARD ANOTHER AUDITS COMING THROUGH WRONG. JUST WRONG SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR WORK I'LL BE KEEPING. AN EYE ON THIS I APPRECIATE -- THE TIME IT TOOK I KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF PIECES TO PUT TOGETHER AND NOT EVERYBODY WAS AT THE TABLE TO HELP YOU WITH THAT SO. I THANK YOU AGAIN. AND THANK YOU FOR THOSE COMMENTS I THINK THAT KINDA IT'S A GOOD SUMMATION OF WHERE WE WANT TO HEAD BUT LET THIS TIME WE ASK IF THERE'S ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENTS YOU'D LIKE TO MAKE. IF. PLEASE SENATOR UMBERG. JUST A COUPLE QUESTIONS IN THESE MAY BE MORE APPROPRIATE FOR THE NEXT PANEL BUT I'LL GIVE THEM A PREVIEW -- I UNDERSTAND HAS BEEN LAWSUITS FILED -- BOTH CLAIMS WITH RESPECT TO INJURIES AS WELL AS LAWSUITS CONCERNING USES OF PROPERTY THAT CURRENTLY IS -- HOMES PROPERTY DID YOU ANALYZE ANY OF THAT IN A THE LAWSUITS -- OR POTENTIAL CLAIMS FOR WE WERE AWARE OF SOME OF THEM AIMED INCLUDING -- DURING A A BIKE -- THAT -- WE ONLY NOTED THAT IT HAD BEEN DISMISSED WE DIDN'T DO MUCH ANALYSIS OF OF THOSE. LAWSUITS OTHER THAN TO NOTE THAT IT IS INDICATIVE OF THE THE THE THE LIABILITY THAT THE STATE IS EXPOSED. TO SO ONE THING THAT WOULD BE OF USE TO ME AT LEAST IS IS SOME ANALYSIS AS TO WHAT HAS BEEN FILED WHAT HAS BEEN RESOLVED AND AND WHAT IS PENDING WHERE THERE'S BEEN CLAIMS THAT. HAVE BEEN ASSERTED BUT HAVE NOT BEEN FILED THAT KIND OF THING JUST SO WE HAVE A SENSE OF THE STATE'S EXPOSURE. AND AGAIN MAYBE THAT MAY BE BEST FOR THE FOR THE CALVET FOLKS BUT I'LL I'LL PUT THAT OUT THERE THEN THE SECOND IS DURING THE COURSE OF YOUR AUDIT DID WERE QUESTIONS S. LIKE WHY DO WHY DO WE HAVE A RESERVOIR AT YON PHIL -- AND IF SO WHAT WERE THE RESPONSES. SO WITH THE RESERVOIR WAS NOT AMONG THE LEASES THAT WE SELECTED FOR REVIEW. BECAUSE WHEN WE REVIEW THE AGREEMENT FOR THE RESERVOIR WE DETERMINED THAT IT WAS NOT A LEASE AND SO WE FOCUS OUR AIRCREW OF REVIEW ON THE AGREEMENTS THAT AND WE DETERMINED TO BE LEASES. OKAY. SO LET ME WHEN WE WHEN WE HAVE THINGS LIKE READ A SUPPOSE THAT'S FOR A FUTURE ANALYSIS AS TO WHY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS A RESERVOIR IS IT. WELL UNLESS THERE'S BEEN A WHAT IS BEING USED FOR ALL RIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU WILL MOVE TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER VOEPEL AS ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS. NOT NECESSARILY A QUESTION WELL ACTUALLY IT IS A LEGAL QUESTION IF. GOING. OVER A FIVE YEAR AGREEMENT AND CONTRACT VIOLATE STATE LAW. WHAT WE HAVE STATE LAWS? SO MY POINT IS. IF THIS WAS IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR. I WOULD ORDER MY ATTORNEY. TO AVOID. THE CONTRACTS INVITED UP IN COURT. THAT ALSO HELPS YOU CAN READ NEGOTIATION TRUST ME ON THAT. ONE SO. WE EITHER HAVE. TO CHANGE STATE LAW. OR IN FOR STATE LAW ON THESE CONTRACTS I WOULD LOVE TO SEE THE LAW CHANGED A BIT. SO THAT [inaudible] THE DIRECTOR. CAN OVERRIDE THE FIVE YEAR CONTRACT UNDER THE DIRECTOR'S AUTHORITY. AND MAKE SURE THAT THE DIRECTORS OF ANY. ANY OF OUR ORGANIZATIONS REPORTED. TO THE PROPER AUTHORITY. THAT WAY THE PENDULUM DOESN'T SWING TOO FAR AWAY. AND WE CAN BE RESPONSIVE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. SOME REAL WOMAN ENOUGH BURGER -- THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR REPORT THIS IS VERY SHOCKING FOR ME TO REALIZE THAT. SO MANY FUNDS ARE NOT GETTING TO THE PEOPLE WHO THEY WERE INTENDED TO TO TO RECEIVE THE BENEFITS. IS THERE ANYTHING YOU DISCOVERED THAT WOULD QUALIFY AS CRIMINAL -- OR RICE LEVEL OF CRIMINAL -- NEGLIGENCE AND DID YOU LOOK AT WHETHER THERE'S ANY APPROPRIATE POLICY PROCEDURES IN PLACE FOR REPORTING TO RELEVANT AUTHORITIES IN TERMS OF GIVE TO PUBLIC FUNDS. YOU KNOW I'M HEARING ABOUT THIS YOU JUST SEE SUCH NEGLIGENCE AT SOME POINT STATE FUNDS ARE BEING USED MISUSED AND MISS ALLOCATED WAS THAT PART OF YOUR AUDIT OR DO YOU HAVE ANY THOUGHTS ON THAT. WE DID NOT IDENTIFY ANYTHING THE RISE A LITTLE OF CRIMINAL LIABILITY -- THERE'S CERTAINLY AS YOU SAID THAT THESE FOR MISUSES OF STATE FUNDS BUT THAT IS A CIVIL AND NOT CRIMINAL AT LEAST AT THE THE THE CRITERIA THAT WITH THAT WE IDENTIFIED -- INCLUDES THE THE MISUSE OF STATE RESOURCES -- AT WHICH THERE ARE -- PENALTIES IN. THE SENSE OF DISCIPLINE. BUT NOT -- CRIMINAL AT THE OKAY THANK YOU WELL MAY I ASK IF THERE'S ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS -- HEARING AND SEEING NINE LET ME THANK THE ARMOR AND HER TEAM FOR YOUR DILIGENT WORK AND LEMME. LAYING THE FRAMEWORK -- FOR US TO MOVE FORWARD SO THIS TIME WE'LL GO AHEAD IN THE INTEREST OF TIME WE'RE GOING TO GO TO CALL UP THE DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS AND THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL SERVICES TOGETHER -- IN THE INTEREST OF TIMES I WOULD IMAGINE BASED OFF THE LINE OF QUESTIONING WE'VE HAD SO FAR. THAT CRAP SAID WE PRUDENT TO HAVE ON BOTH COME UP GIVE A PRESENTATION. AND THEN WE WILL ASK QUESTIONS THAT WILL EITHER THE DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS OR THE FORMER GENERAL SERVICES. CAN GOING TO GIVE A RESPONSE AT THIS TIME FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS WE HAVE A MISTER ABBAS KIANI THE SECRETARY VETERANS AFFAIRS -- THOMAS MARTIN DIRECTOR FUTURE OPERATIONS OF PLANNING DAVID GERARD ASSISTANT DEPUTY SECRETARY FOR CAPITAL ASSETS AND FACILITIES MANAGEMENT. FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL SERVICES WE HAVE JASON KENNEY DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR REAL ESTATE SERVICES DIVISION. AND JIM MARTIN CHIEF BRANCH SO WHEN WE START WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS WILL GO THROUGH PRESENTATION FROM. BOTH VETERANS AFFAIRS INDEED YES AND THEN MOVE ON TO QUESTIONS. SO MISTER BUSCEMI PLEASE. SALAS AND ALL THE MEMBERS OF THIS COMBINED COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME HERE TODAY TO DISCUSS THIS REPORT. ON LEASING IN THE VETERANS HOMES. AND I WOKE. START OFF BY SAYING I WELCOME. THE FINDINGS OF THIS AUDIT AND I APPRECIATE THE WORK OF MS HOWLIN HER STAFF AND LET ME EDITORIALIZE FOR A SECOND -- THE OUR RELATIONSHIP TO THE ORDER IS NOT ADVERSARIAL -- I WAS SO IMPRESSED AT THE PROFESSIONALISM OF EVERYONE IN HER OFFICE WHO SPEND A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF TIME IN OUR BUILDING AND OUR CAMPUSES -- IT WAS -- G. MEAL AND THEY ARE THOROUGH THEIR PROFESSIONAL AND A DELIGHT TO WORK WITH I LOOK ON THEM AS OF SUPPLYING ME WITH ADDITIONAL TOOLS AND I THINK YOU ALSO ADDITIONAL TOOLS. TO HELP ME DO A BETTER JOB AS A STE SO A CARETAKER OF OUR ELDERLY VETERANS -- I WANT THE COMMITTEES KNOW THAT I AM SERIOUS IN ADDRESSING ALL THE MATTERS RAISED IN THAT ORDER AUDIT. AND FEEL IT'S IMPORTANT FOR ME TO RESPOND TO THE IN PERSON. IN ORDER TO PUT MY FOLLOWING REMARKS INTO A BROADER CONTEXT I WANT FIRST TO ACKNOWLEDGE. THAT OUR EIGHT VETERANS HOMES FROM READING TO CHULA VISTA HAVE UNTIL RECENTLY ACTED MORE AS INDEPENDENT FACILITIES RATHER THAN AS A SYSTEM OF LONG TERM CARE. ACCORDING TO THE REPORT THE YOUNG FILL HOME ON ITS OWN ENGAGED OVERTIME IN UNFAVORABLE LONG TERM PROPERTY USE ARRANGEMENTS SOME OF WHICH GO BACK DECADES. NOW CAL THAT AS YOU KNOW HAS A CORE MISSION ON ALL OUR CAMPUSES AND THAT IS TO PROVIDE HIGH QUALITY HEALTHCARE. AND A TRANQUIL HOME LIKE SETTING FOR THE ELDERLY MEN AND WOMEN WHO BRAVELY SERVED OUR NATION IN UNIFORM AND THEIR SPOUSES WHO RESIDE THERE WITH THEM. OUR HOMES ARE PLACES OF COMFORT RESPECT AND SECURITY. I WANT TO BE CLEAR A VETERANS HOME SUCH AS THE ONE IN YON PHIL IS NOT A FORTRESS. WALLED OFF FROM ITS SURROUNDINGS OUR VETERANS HAVE LONG ENJOYED A POSITIVE AND NURTURING RELATIONSHIP WITH THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITY AND WE WOULD LIKE TO CONTINUE THAT RELATIONSHIP. HOWEVER TO PARAPHRASE THE AUDITOR. OUR HOME IS NOT A PUBLIC PARK. IT'S NOT AN EVENT SPACE. IT'S NOT AN EXTENSION OF THE FAIRGROUNDS. CALVET FEELS THAT THIS SPACE ARE VETERANS HOME CAN BE SHARED WITH THE COMMUNITY AS LONG AS DAY EVENTS AND LONG TERM LEASES ALIGNED BOTH WITH OUR CORE MISSION OF CARING FOR ELDERLY. DESTITUTE VETERANS AND TO PROTECT THE STATE INTERESTS AS WE DO SO. THE ORDER JUST OUTLINED HER FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS SO I'D LIKE TO TOUCH ON WHAT WE'VE DONE SO FAR. AND WHAT WE'RE CURRENTLY DOING TO ADDRESS THE ISSUES GOING FORWARD. FIRST AS SHE MENTIONED EVEN BEFORE THE PUBLISHED WE BEGAN TAKING STEPS TO IMPROVE LEASE MANAGEMENT AT ALL OF OUR HOMES. AND THESE EFFORTS CONTINUE TODAY I'M HAPPY TO REPORT THAT ALL LEASES ENTERED INTO IN THE PRESENT REGIME. THAT MEANS MAY. HAVE IT HERE TO THE MAXIMUM LEASE PERIOD OF FIVE YEARS I DISAGREE WITH ONE OF THE ASSEMBLY WOMEN WHO SAID NOTHING'S HAPPENED IN FIVE YEARS. EVERY LEAST OF CALVET ENTERED INTO SINCE THAT NINETEEN THIRTY THIRD. TWENTY THIRTEEN AUDIT HAS COMPLIED WITH THE STATE MANUAL THAT REGULATES THESE KINDS OF LEASES. IT'S MY LONG TERM LEASES THAT GIVE ME -- HARPER. THESE LEASES OFFERED DIRECT AND TANGIBLE BENEFITS TO OUR RESIDENTS SECONDLY. THE AUDIT INCLUDED NINE INDIVIDUAL RECOMMENDATIONS I'M PROUD TO SAY THE SEVERAL OF THE NINE RECOMMENDATIONS HAVE ALREADY BEEN IMPLEMENTED AND SOLUTIONS TO THE REMAINING ONES ARE IN DEVELOPMENT. SINCE TWENTY FIFTEEN CALVET HAS MADE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS IMPROVING PROPERTY MANAGEMENT. CALVET HAS RENEGOTIATED PRIOR AGREEMENTS TO ENSURE THOSE LEASES BETTER SERVE THE RESIDENTS AND PROTECT STATE INTERESTS. APPROVAL AUTHORITY FOR ANY NEW LEASE NOW RESTS EXCLUSIVELY WITH SENIOR LEADERSHIP IN SACRAMENTO AND NOT WITH THE HOMES ADMINISTRATORS [inaudible] BY ME. WITH REGARD TO THESE ONE DAY -- EVENTS BICYCLE RACES PICNICS ON THE SUCH THESE ARE NOT LEASES THESE ARE LICENSES SO WITH REGARD TO THOSE I HAVE ISSUED A NEW PROPERTY USE POLICY. THIS POLICY WILL GIVE SOME PHASE IN TIME. THIS YEAR. FOR PART OF THIS YEAR FOR LICENSEES TO ADJUST THEIR PLANS AND NOT TO HAVE THEM IN KERR ANY FINANCIAL -- DISCOMFORT. BY SUDDENLY PULLING THE RUG OUT FROM UNDER THEM. BUT THESE NEW ARRANGEMENTS WILL STILL PROTECT THE TERM THE STATE IN TERMS OF LIABILITY. SAFETY SECURITY AND IT WILL ENSURE THAT THE RESIDENTS ARE NOT UNDULY DISRUPTED. EVERY HOUSING LEASE FOR EMPLOYEES ON THE ON FILL CAMPUS HAS BEEN RE WRITTEN TO MEET CAL HR REQUIREMENTS AND BEST PRACTICES.

ADDRESSED APPROPRIATELY MOVING FORWARD -- WITH THAT WE'RE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE ON ANY OF THE AUDIT FINDINGS. THANK YOU. RIGHT THIS TIME WILL RETURN BACK TO MEMBERS ON THE DíAS AND LET ME SAY I APPRECIATE. YOUR COMMENTS ABOUT TAKING CORRECTIVE ACTION OBVIOUSLY THERE WAS A NUMBER OF ISSUES IDENTIFIED IN THE AUDIT -- THIS PAST AUDIT OR NOT IT'S PREVIOUSLY -- MYSTERY BUG BUSCEMI YET TALKED ABOUT -- CHANGE OVER THE DEPARTMENT IN TERMS OF EMBRACING THE AUDITOR HER TEAM. AND OUR RECOMMENDATIONS AND SO. AT THIS TIME -- YOU KNOW ONE THING YOU HAD MENTIONED IS EVERY LEASE NOW IS WITHIN THE FIVE YEAR -- THE FIVE YEAR TIME SPAN BUT DOES THAT FIVE YEAR ALSO INCLUDE. THE TERMINATION CLAUSES OUT AS OUTLINED IN THE AUDITOR'S REPORT AND DO WE HAVE A CRITERIA ESTABLISHED FOR WHAT'S IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF THE HOMES. YEAH YES WE HAVE A DOCUMENT THAT -- TRIES TO THIS IS A PHILOSOPHICAL DOCUMENT IS NOT THE EASIEST THING IN THE WORLD TO WRITE. WHAT'S IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE HOMES IN THE VETERANS THAT LIVE THERE BUT WE'VE GOT ONE THAT AT LEAST HAS -- PAST FIRST SCRUTINY WITH TGS BUT I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT IS STILL WORK IN PROGRESS AND WILL CONTINUE TO WORK TOGETHER IN PARTNERSHIP UNTIL WE'RE BOTH. A SATISFIED BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO RELY ON EACH OTHER GOING FORWARD -- WORKING TO SAY WE WANT THIS AND INTO THE VETERANS CAN WE GO LINE BY LINE AND MAKE SURE THAT THIS LEAST COMPORTS WITH THAT FAST -- THERE WAS THE FIRST PART TO YOUR QUESTION -- IT WAS JUST EVERYTHING'S WITH A WAS OUR FOR YOUR LEASES NOW THAT YOU'VE DONE TO SAID YOU'RE DOWN COMPLIANCE WITH FIVE YOUR OF THE FOR THE FOR THE NOW HAVE YOU BUILT IN TERMINATION CLAUSES FOR THOSE FOR THE STATE IF THE STATE NEEDS TO BACK OUT OR TO YES. RIGHT AND WITH RESPECT TO THE ENTITIES THAT -- WE'VE DISCOVERED THAT ARE JUST SORT OF SQUATTING ON THE CAMPUS THIS IS A VAST CAMPUS AND I AND I I'M GOING TO TAKE THE LIBERTY AND JUST TELL YOU. WHEN THREE SENTENCES OF WHY IT'S TAKING ME THREE YEARS TO GET AROUND TO THIS? I WAS HIRED BECAUSE I'M A PHYSICIAN I WAS HIRED TO COME IN AND BRING THE EIGHT VETERANS HOMES FROM THE TWENTIETH CENTURY INTO THE TWENTY FIRST. AND WITH NO DISRESPECT TO MY PREDECESSORS -- I FOUND ALL EIGHT HOMES TO BE OF MEDIOCRE QUALITY. THEY WERE AT TWO STARS NOT MY DECISION. AND I DEVOTED ALL OF MY SKILL EXPERTISE AND TIME AND ENERGY. TO CREATING A SYSTEM OF HOMES AND BY SYSTEMATIZING AND STANDARDIZING OPERATIONS ACROSS ALL THE HOMES THAT IMPROVE PATIENT SAFETY. AND INCREASED EFFICIENCY BUT ENABLED ME TO INCREASE THE QUALITY OF CARE DELIVERED TO THOSE RESIDENTS. I CAN HELP VERY HAPPILY TELL YOU NOW ALL EIGHT HOMES ARE IT FIVE STARS. AND WERE RECENTLY -- CITED BY US NEWS AND WORLD REPORT IN NOVEMBER. AS AMONG THE TOP ONE HUNDRED NURSING FACILITIES IN CALIFORNIA I'M VERY PROUD OF THAT I DIDN'T DO IT MY STAFF DID OKAY WE'VE GONE FROM TWO STARS TO FIVE STAR. WHEN THAT HAPPENED LATE LAST YEAR IT ENABLED THE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MY TEN YEAR TO TURN MY ATTENTION TO THE MORE MUNDANE ASPECTS? OF THE BUSINESS. NOW I LOOK TO SOME OF THOSE LEASES WHEN I FIRST GOT HERE AND WAS -- I I'M NOT A LAWYER AND I'M NOT A PROPERTY MANAGER BUT I WAS KIND OF SHOCKED BY THE TERMS OF THIS. I I WONDERED WHO HAD A GUN TO THEIR HEAD WHEN THEY SIGN THESE -- BUT JOE. IN CONSULTATION WITH MY LAWYERS I DISCOVERED THAT SOME OF THEM WE COULD DEAL WITH AND SOME OF THEM WE COULDN'T. WHEN THE AUDIT STARTED AROUND THE CAMPUS ROOM BY ROOM AND I WAS ASTOUNDED AT WHAT WE FOUND -- THE SEIU WAS USING THEM -- ROOMS IN OUR HOLDEN BUILDING -- FOR WHICH THEY PAID NO RENT -- FOR YEARS -- A MED TECH -- REPAIR COMPANY WAS USING ROOMS NAPA COUNTY FOR THIRTY YEARS HAD BEEN USING THE OLD I SEE YOU WHICH WAS SET UP AS A NURSE TRAINING STATION FORGIVE ME WHEN I FIRST GOT HIRED AND WALK MY THAT. I JUST THOUGHT IT WAS PART OF THE VETERANS HOME IT NEVER DAWNED ON ME TO ACTUALLYINQUIRE WHAT WAS THE LEGAL UNDERPINNING OF THAT WHICH WAS. NINE WE'RE IN THE PROCESS WITH ALL FOUR OF I THINK I'VE NAME FOR THEM OF EITHER. REGULAR ISING THAT ARRANGEMENT AND REQUESTING LAN A WRENCH OR ASKING THEM TO LEAVE. NOW WHAT SEEMS LIKE YOU DISCOVERED A LOT. DURING THAT TIME AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WAS BROUGHT UP IN THE LAST PANEL WAS THE ISSUE OF LIABILITIES AND SO I KNOW FOR INSTANCE -- THERE WAS. REPORTED INCIDENCES OF THE MEDIAN I BELIEVE IT WAS ALSO IDENTIFIED IN THE AUDITOR'S REPORTS FOR INSTANCE LIKE A NOT KNOWING THAT THERE WAS HOT AIR BALLOON LAUNCHES FROM THE GOLF COURSE FOR INSTANCE AND ONE WAS A LIABILITY ON THAT. BUT AS YOU -- YOU ALSO MENTION NOW YOU HAVE A PROPERTY YOU THIS POLICY DOWN. AND COMPASS. YOU KNOW THE LIABILITY ISSUE AS WELL. ABOUT A YEAR AND A HALF AGO -- THE ISSUE OF BALLOONS ON THE GOLF COURSE CAME UP AND I WENT OVER AND MET WITH THE GENTLEMAN THAT MANAGES SAID AND HE SAID WELL WE HAVE LIABILITY. WE ALSO HAVE A CONVERSATION OF OF THE FACT THAT -- A JUNIOR ADMINISTRATOR AT THE AWFUL CAMPUS EIGHT YEARS AGO DECIDED IT WAS JUST TOO MUCH WORK FOR CALVET TO BE LOOKING INTO HIS BOOKS. TO FIGURE OUT THE THE PROFIT SHARING ARRANGEMENTS SO SHE SAID SHE SAID TO THE GOLF COURSE WILL JUST CUT US A CHECK EACH MONTH AND THAT'LL BE FINE. SO -- I DIDN'T KNOW THAT UNTIL THE AUDIT HAPPEN AND WE'RE GOING TO SIT DOWN THIS WEEK WITH THE GOLF COURSE AND HAVE A AN ATTEMPT TO RENEGOTIATE THAT LEASE. IT WILL INCLUDE SUB LEASES. WE DON'T DEAL WITH THE BALLOON COMPANY THAT'S A SUBLEASE OF THE GOLF COURSE BUT YOU HAVE TO KNOW. IN OUR OPINION IF I MAY ANY USE OF THE GOLF COURSE HAS TO BE REASONABLY RELATED TO OPERATING THAT GOLF COURSE. AND THE SOUL PRIMARY USE OF THAT PROPERTY HAS TO BE A GOLF RECREATION FACILITY I THINK ANYONE WOULD BE HARD PRESSED TO SAY THE BALLOONS. ARE A REASONABLY RELATED TO THE OPERATION OF THE GOLF COURSE NOR DO THEY COMPORT WITH OUR MISSION. THE BALLOONS HAVE NO BENEFITS TO OUR VETERANS AND THEIR INHERENTLY DANGEROUS SO IT IS MY INTENTION. TO WORK WITH THE BALLOON COMPANY TO ASK EIGHT TO ANOTHER PART OF THE COUNTY -- AND THE TO GIVE THEM SOME TIME TO DO THAT. CUT IT. SO THANK YOU FOR COMMENTING ON THAT I KNOW THERE ARE A NUMBER OF EXAMPLES THAT WE CAN POINT TO AND BUT I WILL ALLOW SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES. TO ASK QUESTIONS AND THEN I'LL CONTINUE WITH MY LINE OF QUESTIONING [inaudible] BELIEVE. ASSEMBLY WOMAN AROUND. THANK YOU AND APPRECIATE AGAIN HOW PROACTIVE YOU HAVE BEEN OF AND AND SOME OF THESE QUESTIONS I'M NOT SURE IF IT'S TGS OUR CALVET THAT SHOULD BE ANSWERING SO IN THE TWENTY THIRTEEN AUDIT OF YON PHIL -- IT WAS REPORTED THAT AN OFFICIAL INDEED FROM TGS ADVISE CALVET THAT THE CONTRACT THAT IT HAD ENTERED INTO WITH THE VENDOR WAS ILLEGAL -- FOR SEVERAL REASONS NOT THE LEAST OF WHICH IT WAS -- LONGER THAN FIVE YEARS. IN THIS AUDITS -- TGS SAYS THEY BELIEVE THAT THE LIMIT DOES NOT APPLY TO LEASES DISCREPANCY. YEAH YEAH I'LL I'LL FILL THAT ONE SO -- AND I DEFINITELY PREFER THE CONCERN THE DISCREPANCY -- THERE THERE ARE A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT POLICING AUTHORITIES AND STATUTES SO ONE GOVERNMENT CODE ONE FOUR SIX SEVEN ZERO IS ONE GOVERNMENT CUT ELEVEN ELEVEN POINT TWO IS ONE MILITARY PATRICK -- TEN TWENTY THREE IS -- ONE WELL FIRST USING CODE -- FOR THREE SIXTY IS ONE THERE'S THERE'S NUMEROUS DIFFERENT AUTHORITIES AND THEY ALL COME APPLYING VARIOUS DIFFERENT SITUATIONS AND CIRCUMSTANCES SOME DEPARTMENT SPECIFIC LIKE THE NBC SEXUALLY CITED. SOMEWHERE GENERAL TO DDS IS AUTHORITY -- ONE FOUR SIX SEVEN ZERO ABSOLUTELY DOES HAVE A FIVE YEAR PROHIBITION -- OTHER STORIES DO NOT TELL OF ELEVEN POINT TWO DOES NOT FOR EXAMPLE THAT ALLOWS FOR A LONG TERM BASIS -- WHEN WE LOOK AT? TEN TWENTY THREE WHICH IS THE AUTHORITY THAT WE WERE DISCUSSING WITH THE AUDITORS AND THE REPORT -- THAT ALLOWS US TO LEASE AT TERMS DEEMED TO BE IN THE BEST INTEREST THE STATE BY BY THE DIRECTOR OF THE G. S. -- OTHER TERRITORY LANGUAGE VERTICALLY ELEVEN ELEVEN POINT TWO DESCRIBES DURATION AS A TERM SO WE WOULDN'T FOR THAT -- WE COULD SET A LONGER TERM BASED ON TEN TWENTY THREE LANGUAGE. IN ADDITION -- THE TEN TWENTY THREE STAFF EARLY EIGHTIES -- THERE WAS AN ROLE BILL REPORT -- ON A CLEAN UP -- PROVISION THAT HAPPENED -- IN EIGHTY TWO THAT DESCRIBED ELEVEN ELEVEN I'M SORRY TEN TWENTY THREE AS ALLOWING LONG TERM LEASES -- THERE'S EVEN A A LAWSUIT THAT OCCURRED -- IN THE MID NINETIES -- WHERE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL -- ISSUE OF FILING THAT MADE THE ARGUMENT THAT TEN TWENTY THREE ALLOWED LONG TERM LEASING IN ADDITION TO IT. SEPARATE FROM ONE FOUR SIX SEVEN ZERO SO I I MAKE THE ARGUMENT THAT -- YES TEN TWENTY THREE DOES ALLOW LONG TERM LEASING -- TWO SECRETARIES POINT OUR PREFERENCE FOR ANY LEASING OF STATE PROPERTY GENERALLY IS IN THE SHORT TERM THE CHANGE IN -- THAT HAPPENS ON STATE PROPERTY AND STATE FUNCTIONS AS FREQUENT OFF WHERE WE WOULD GENERALLY NOT WANT TO SEE ANYTHING LONG TERM AND AS POINT ME OUT OF MOST OF THESE LEASES WITH PROBLEMS. ARE EXACTLY THOSE LONG TERM LEASES -- BUT YES ULTIMATELY I THINK DEPEND SOME TO ALLOW FOR LONG TERM LEASES AND SOME DO NOT OKAY -- BUT THAT WAS JUST WITH THAT ONE SPECIFIC. PROPERTY -- WELL CITING WHAT SPECIFICALLY YEAH BUT THE TECH THE TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN RESPONSE MAKES THE THE DEVIOUS OFFICIAL WHO RESPONDED CITED -- ONE FOUR SIX SEVEN ZERO SO I I WOULD ASSUME THAT WAS THE OPERATING AUTHORITY THAT THE LEASE WAS ENTERED INTO -- AND AND WHICH CASE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN SUBJECT TO THE FIVE YEAR LIMITATION. OKAY AND THEN -- I HAD ASKED. ASKED BEFORE IT DOES. TO THE AUDITOR ABOUT THE MUSEUM LEASE AGREEMENT AND AND KIND OF CAN YOU CLARIFY THE STATUS OF YOUR BUILDING IN BUT WHAT DOES HAPPEN -- UPON EXPIRATION OF THE LEASE SURE THERE WERE THERE WAS AN AMENDMENT -- TO THAT LISA CLARIFY THAT -- IT'S PROVISION THIRTY FIVE AND I THINK A COPY IF YOU WANT TO SEE IT BUT ULTIMATELY WHAT IT SAYS IS AT THE END OF THE DAY -- WHEN THE TERM RUNS OUT THE LESS HE COMES TO US AND SAYS YOU TODAY? WOULD LIKE TO RENEW OR THEY WOULD LIKE TO RIGHT NOW. IF THEY WOULD LIKE TO RENEW AND WE'RE OKAY WITH THAT WE CAN RENEW. IF THEY WOULD LIKE TO RENEW AND WE DO NOT WANT THEM TO CONTINUE IN THE STATE TAKE POSSESSION OF THE PROPERTY INCLUDING THE IMPROVEMENTS -- IF AT THE END THAT TERM THEY DECIDE THAT THEY DO NOT WANT TO RENEW THEMSELVES THE LEAST OBLIGATES THEM -- TO ELIMINATE THOSE IMPROVEMENTS OR TURN THE IT TOOK GREEN FIELD. TO ELIMINATE THE IMPROVEMENTS YES. IT WOULD REQUIRE AN TO DEMOLISH THEM IF IF THEY CHOOSE NOT IF THEY COME TO US AND SAY YEAH WE'VE NO INTEREST WHATSOEVER. IN CONTINUING ON THAN WE COULD REQUIRE THEM TO THE MOST IMPROVEMENTS. WEEK WE COULD ALSO BY -- AGREED NOT. TO ALLOW THE NOT TO TEAR IT DOWN AND THEN TO TAKE ON OWNERSHIP AND MANAGEMENT OURSELVES YES. WE ARE OBLIGATED IT'S GOOD POINT. NO IT'S GOOD POINT GOOD POINT GOOD POINT OKAY -- DOCTOR BOSS YANNI YOU OF THAT YOU. ACTUALLY -- TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THIS BUT BEING A ROLE WITHIN THIS WITH A ON'T AS PART OF THE COMMUNITY THE WHAT WHAT DO YOU THINK IS THE RIGHT BALANCE AND DO YOU THINK THAT IN ORDER TO STRIKE THAT BALANCE. AND TO BE FAIR AND IMPARTIAL THAT WE NEED TO TIGHTEN SOME STATUTORY AND REGULATORY LOOPHOLES. HOME I'LL BE CAREFUL NOT TO TREAD -- IN T. YOUR YOUR AREA OF EXPERTISE -- THAT LET'S BE HONEST THIS IS THE OLDEST AND LARGEST VETERANS CEMETERY IN THE COUNTRY -- THE ASSEMBLY. VETERANS HOME AND THE CEMETERY AT THE TOP THERE IS -- IS REALLY THE OLDEST SON AND VERY VULNERABLE AND HAS -- CIVIL WARVETERANS VETERANS OF THE MEXICAN AMERICAN WAR. THE IMPROVEMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE -- THROUGH THE GENEROSITY OF THE PEOPLE IN THE TOWN AND COMMUNITY IS -- PROBABLY NON PER I'LL IT'S EXTRAORDINARY AND IT CEMENTS THE RELATIONSHIP I THINK BETWEEN. THE HOME AND THE COMMUNITY ALSO THE MORE VOTING MEMBERS. I THINK THEY MAKE UP ONE THIRD OF THE ELECTORATE IN THE OUT FILL. AND IT'S NOT MY WISH THAT THOSE LARGE IMPROVEMENTS GO AWAY -- WILL HAVE MORE TO SAY THAT WHEN WE GET TO THE MASTER PLAN -- POSSIBLY AT THE END OF THIS YEAR. BUT LET ME SAY THAT -- FOR EXAMPLE -- YOU KNOW WE WE ASSESS THE MUSEUM OF RENT OF FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH. IN. NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT THAT RENT OVER THIRTY ONE YEARS HAS HAS RISEN TO THE BREATHTAKINGLY -- HIGH -- NUMBER OF FIVE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY THREE DOLLARS AND THIRTY THREE CENTS A MONTH -- SO. I I DON'T WANT. TO I'M NOT IN THE LOOKING TO PUT ANY WHILE BUSINESS SIX EXCEPT POSSIBLY PASSED THE BALLOONS TO MOVE DOWN THE ROAD A BIT -- BUT IT'S NOT CLEAR TO ME THAT SOME OF THESE ACTIVITIES HAVE. ABSOLUTE TANGIBLE BENEFITS TO THE VETERANS FOR EXAMPLE -- WE USED TO HAVE AN ARRANGEMENT WITH THE THEATER THAT THE VETERANS WERE GIVEN A FREE TICKETS AND THAT WAS RE NEGOTIATED A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO SO THAT. NOW EFFECTIVELY BUT LET'S TAKE A TAKE THE LAST THREE YEARS WE HAVE RECEIVED OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS SIXTY THOUSAND DOLLARS IN RENT FROM THE THE LINCOLN THEATRE. BUT WE HAVE PAID THE LINCOLN THEATRE -- IN TICKETS [inaudible] AND OUR RENT FROM THE THEATER IS FIFTY FIVE DOLLARS A DAY BUT WHEN I ASKED ONE DAY. TO HAVE THE ARMED FORCES BANNED FROM TRAVIS AIR FORCE BASE CALM DOWN AND GIVE A CHRISTMAS CONCERT TO THESE VETERANS. I'M CHARGED OF A FEE OF JUST SHY OF FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS AND I HAD TO CANCEL THAT. THAT CONCERT FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS. WE CLEARLY HAVE WORK TO DO WITH THE MANAGEMENT OF THE MUSEUM AND THE THEATER THE THEATER MANAGEMENT HAS BEEN -- EXTRAORDINARILY DIFFICULT FOR ME TO WORK WITH. YEAH THAT SEEMS -- VERY DISHEARTENING AND I WAS JUST I WAS ACTUALLY LOOKING AT THAT AGREEMENT IT SEEM LIKE THAT PROVISION WAS REMOVED IN. TWO THOUSAND AND TWELVE CAN YOU COMMENT ON WHY WE WOULD WHY THAT WAS EVEN REMOVED OR HOW THAT KEEPING CAME ABOUT. IN TERMS OF I'M SORRY I I NEGLECTED. TO DAVE GIRARD -- IS SO THE DEPUTY -- FOR CONTRACTS AND PROCUREMENT AND THOMAS MARTIN IS THE ASSISTANT TO THE HOMES MANAGER. THE UNDERSECRETARY THANK YOU TOM PLEASE. HI AGAIN THOMAS MARTIN -- AT DROPPED IF YOU DROP PERSONS PLANNING IS. THIS IS A COMMON REFRAIN IN THE IN HIS HOUSE -- AS TO MONNING -- WE WEREN'T AROUND AT THAT TIME WE'RE NOT SURE WHY IT WAS NEGOTIATED AWAY IN. TWENTY TWELVE IT'S SO I CAN CERTAINLY SAY SOME FORTUNE AS A SECTOR SAYING -- THAT ALLOW THIS BENEFITS TO OUR RESIDENTS WERE ELIMINATED -- BUT WE'RE NOT AWARE OF THERE'S THERE'S NO DOCUMENTATION EXPLAIN WHY THE DECISION WAS MADE. OR WHY THIS ONE IS BENEFITS WOULD BE GIVEN UP -- SPASO AS PART OF A AS SETTLEMENTS -- THAT BEEN NEGOTIATED THAT YEAR BUT AGAIN THE DETAILS CERTAIN UNFORTUNATELY LOST TO US AT THIS TIME. IT JUST DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO ME OF 10% OF THE SEATS WERE SET ASIDE FOR VETERANS AND THEIR MEMBERS -- WHY WE WOULD NEGOTIATE THAT BENEFIT AWAY FOR VETERANS? AND YOU KNOW ADDITIONALLY TO YOUR POINT MR AMBOS COUNTY YOU KNOW. BEING A GOOD PARTNER IF YOU WANTED A HOST EVENTS FOR VETERANS AND YOU'RE BEING CHARGED. FULL PRICE WHEN [inaudible] YEP. THIS ARRANGEMENT IS ACTUALLY COSTING YOU MORE MONEY THAN IT IS ACTUALLY BENEFITING ANY OF THE VETERANS. WITH A POINT TO A NUMBER OF THESE AGREEMENTS WITH THESE LONG TERM LEASES -- ONE OF THE OTHER THINGS I WAS LOOKING AT ALSO WAS A EVEN WITH THE FIRE DEPARTMENT WHERE THEY CHARGE CAL THAT SEVEN HUNDRED AND THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. BUT YET TGS WAVE THE THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS THE THAT THEY WOULD. THAT THEY WOULD CHARGE THEM I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WANT TO COMMENT ON THAT OR MAYBE D. G. S. CAN COMMENT ON THAT. BUT IT'S SEVEN THIRTY AND THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLAR WAY WHEN THEY'RE CHARGING YOU. YOU KNOW THREE QUARTERS OF A MILLION DOLLARS -- DOESN'T SEEM APPROPRIATE. YEAH AND AND THIS IS WHERE AS SECRETARY SAID THAT REFRAIN OF THE POOR DOCUMENTATION AND NO ONE BEING AROUND MAKES IT DIFFICULT -- I MEAN THE THERE IS THERE IS THE ORAL HISTORY I'LL SAY IT THAT WAY -- BUT WHETHER THAT ACTUALLY IS IS I COULD NOT A DIFFERENT STORY -- SO AND ALL THAT BUT AT THE RISK OF SOUNDING WILL SPECULATIVE I MEAN GOING BACK TO THE FIRST POINT YOU MADE ABOUT THE RENEGOTIATION OF THE THE TICKETS WILL. TWO THOUSAND TWELVE THE OPERATOR OF THE THEATER WENT BANKRUPT AND SO THERE'S A BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDING THERE'S A SETTLEMENT NEGOTIATION THEIR ORAL HISTORY IS THAT PART OF THAT -- NEGOTIATION OR TO MAKE IT MORE PROFITABLE TO RUN THEY NEEDED TO MAXIMIZE REVENUE AND SO THE OTHERS THOSE LITTLE TINY TIDBITS OF HANDS THAT WHETHER THAT WAS A JUSTIFIABLE DECISION WHEN I WAS REALLY JUST SORT OF WENT WITH THAT ACTUALLY WHAT HAPPENED A LITTLE HARD TO TELL -- AS IT RELATES TO THE THE THE FIRE TRAINING YOU KNOW ABOUT THE AGAIN ORAL HISTORY IS THAT THERE THERE IS A IT'S MEANT TO BE AN OFFSET ULTIMATELY AGAINST WHAT WITH THE STATE WOULD NORMALLY PAY FOR SOME OF THOSE FIRE PROTECTION SERVICES -- BUT AGAIN IT'S IT'S THIS IS THIS IS ALL THE MINUTE ANSWERS WHAT HAPPENED BACK THEN WHEN THOSE THINGS WERE NEGOTIATED. YEAH I JUST IT'S IT'S SHOCKING BECAUSE SEEMS LIKE A LOT OF THESE WE NEGOTIATIONS ARE THESE AMENDMENTS OBVIOUSLY -- BENEFIT THE BUSINESS VENDORS AT THE EXPENSE OF OTHER VETERANS OF THE HOMES AND YOU KNOW WE KNOW THAT YOUNG FILL IN THESE HOMES RE DESIGNATED TO BE PRIMARILY -- SERVICING VETERANS AND SO AS WE CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD HOW DO WE RENEGOTIATE THESE -- LONG TERM LEASES SO THAT THEY DO BENEFITS -- ORAL TO GO WHICH IS SERVING VETERANS. AND A YOU KNOW I I AM A LITTLE DISHEARTENED WHEN HERE FIFTY YEAR LEASES I I GET THE CAPITAL COSTS AND MAKING THAT PLAY OUT BUT WHEN THOSE BUSINESS VENDORS ARE -- PULLING BACK FROM OFFERING YOU KNOW 10% OF THEIR AVAILABLE SPACE IN THE THEATER OR FREE ADMISSION AT THE MUSEUM. YOU KNOW. IT DOESN'T SEEM VERY BENEFICIAL FOR THE VETERANS ARE FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHEN WE'RE ASSUMING ALL THE LIABILITY FOR THIS MOVING FORWARD -- I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF IMPROVEMENT THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE AND YOU KNOW I KNOW YOU GUYS COMMENTED IS. A LITTLE ON SOME OF THE THE PROCEDURAL THINGS THAT YOU WERE DOING THE POLICIES AT YOUR EMPLOYMENT IN BUT WHAT ADDITIONALLY TO WE NEED TO DO TO HELP ENSURE THAT WE HAVE THE BEST INTERESTS OF VETERANS MOVING FORWARD. HOW CAN THE STATE ON OUR SIDE AS LEGISLATORS WHETHER THAT'S DONE THROUGH STATUTE AND THEN WAS OR WHEN WAS TALKING ABOUT A COUPLE OF GOVERNMENT CODES? HOW CAN WE DO WHAT WE DO ON OUR SITE ACTUALLY HELP YOU -- WITH BECAUSE THAT WE HAVE PLEASE YOU COULD THE P. -- TO TO ACQUIRE A SMALL AUDIT -- UNIT IN CALVET -- THAT -- THEY WOULD BE ABLE -- TO IT'S IN THE BUDGET -- WE WOULD BE ABLE -- TO BEFORE WARNED OF SOME OF THESE ISSUES AND WOULD BE ABLE -- TO BETTER ABLE AS PER THE ORDERS REQUEST OF US TO RIDE HERD OVER WITH THE PROPERTIES THAT WERE MANAGING. ON THAT WOULD BE AT THAT WOULD BE AN ENORMOUS HELP TO ME. SO WE WILL LOOK INTO THAT AND THEN I KNOW MR VOTE VOEPEL IN THE THE PREVIOUS PANEL ACTUALLY ASKED ABOUT POTENTIAL LITIGATION IS THAT SOMETHING THAT. THE DEPARTMENT WOULD ENTERTAIN KIND OF MOVING FORWARD AS WELL. WITH THESE -- BUSINESS MATTERS. I I'M I'M SORRY I I YOU'RE REFERRING TO AT LITIGATION TO TO TERMINATE -- TERMINATOR JUST AMEND OKAY -- YES WHICH SAYS A SECTOR MENTIONED WE ARE WE'RE WORKING WITH TGS TO SEE WHAT OUR OPTIONS WHAT OPTIONS ARE AVAILABLE TO US. TO TERMINATE IN AND IN THOSE CASES WHERE WE CAN -- AND RENEGOTIATE AND OTHER KEY. OBVIOUSLY THE WILLINGNESS OF THE THE LASSIES -- IN. EIGHT JUST BECAUSE JUST BECAUSE TODAY WE DON'T NECESSARILY AGREE WITH THE THE TERMS ARE RENTAL RATES FOR ANY OF THOSE ASPECTS DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN IT'S NOT A VALID AGREEMENT -- THAT WE WE MAY BE BOUND TO FIVE AGAIN THAT'S PART OF THE RESEARCH THAT WE'RE DOING TO FIND OUT -- TO I I BELIEVE IT WAS -- ONE OF THAT WHEN THEY ALLEGE THIS POINT -- TO SEE IF THERE'S IF THERE'S A POTENTIAL WAY TO AVOID THE AGREEMENT OR CHANGE IN SOME WAY ESPECIALLY FOR THOSE AGREEMENTS ARE TAKING AWAY BENEFITS BENEFITS FROM VETERANS -- WITH LIKE WE TALKED BUT I NEVER SIR WHAT HAS ONE ADDITIONAL QUESTION THE REMOVED TO CENTER ARCH LETTER THAN TO SENATOR DODD -- REMEMBER THAT I GUESS I COULDN'T MAKE IT KIND OF LIKE I DID HAVE A BILL ON THE AUDITOR AND PERHAPS WE CAN. TRY THAT ONE AGAIN. OF SO -- ONE OF THE DISTURBING THINGS ABOUT TRYING TO REMEMBER EVERYTHING THROUGH HORRELL ORAL HISTORY IS -- YOU KNOW AS SOON AS THOSE PEOPLE LEFT WE HAVE NO IDEA REALLY WHAT HAPPENS SO HOPEFULLY GOING FORWARD WE'RE NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT PUTTING POLICIES IN PLACE BUT ALSO. MAKING SURE THAT THE RECORD KEEPING IS -- ACCURATE AND YOU TALK ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED AND TWENTY TWELVE THAT YOU TOOK AWAY THAT THAT VETERANS BECAUSE THE COMPANY RUNNING THEATER DECLARED BANKRUPTCY. BUT THE WORLD MY UNDERSTANDING IS THERE WAS ALSO A BIG STATE INVESTMENTS A FEW YEARS BEFORE TO TRY TO KEEP THE ORDER SOLVE IT IS THAT ACCURATE. YEAH. THAT'S GOING BACK INTO OUR HISTORY AND I'M A LITTLE ON THAT. I WAS IT WAS -- TWO THOUSAND FOUR BUT THE POINT IS THERE THERE HAS CERTAINLY BEEN SOME STATE INVESTMENT SO THEN A FEW YEARS LATER TO GIVE AWAY -- ALL THE THE SEATS AT LEAST DOESN'T. MAKE SENSE BUT REALLY THE THE QUESTION I HAVE BECAUSE I KNOW A LOT OF MY COLLEAGUES HAVE OTHER QUESTIONS AS AS FORGIVE DOCTOR BOSS YANNI. HOW DOES THIS AUDIT -- INFORMED -- THE MASTER PLAN AND A LOT OF US ARE. VERY ANXIOUS TO SEE -- WHAT'S GOING TO BE IN THERE AND HOW WE MOVE FORWARD BUT ARE THESE FINDINGS GOING -- TO HELP MOVE THIS FORWARD. CHAU EGGMAN LET ME BE CLEAR THERE'S TWO THINGS AFOOT THAT AYE AYE TWO THINGS TO OBLIGATIONS I HAVE TO PRESENT TO THE LEGISLATURE BY THE END OF THIS YEAR ONCE ISN'T IS A NEEDS ASSESSMENT. AND THAT IS. WE WERE TASKED BY THE LEGISLATURE TO START THINKING AHEAD TEN TWENTY AND THIRTY YEARS TO SEE HOW IS THE VETERAN POPULATION CHANGING WHAT ARE THE NUMBERS THAT WILL BE COMING OUT US WHERE WILL THEY BE COMING FROM. WHAT AGES WILL THEY HAVE WHAT WHAT -- MEDICAL BURDENS WILL THEY BEAR THE THE VETERANS THAT ARE COMING WE ALREADY START TO SEE SOME OF THE EVIDENCE COMING THROUGH -- WE HAVE MEETINGS -- MONTHLY IT'S NOW GETTING TO BE -- MASTER PLAN SO IT -- AND I'LL GIVE YOU A LITTLE BIT MORE ON THAT IN A SECOND -- WE ALREADY START TO SEE SOME OF THE TRENDS THE THE FOR THE VETERANS THAT I'M GONNA BE TASKED WITH TAKING CARE OF FOR MAKING SURE THAT MY SUCCESSORS. WILL BE WELL EQUIPPED ARE NOT WORLD WAR TWO VETERANS THESE ARE NOT -- THESE ARE THE THE THE COMING WITH A MUCH MORE HEAVY MEDICAL BURDEN -- THE COMING WITH SIGNIFICANTLY MORE DIAGNOSIS ON THE WORLD WAR TWO AND KOREAN VETS -- CAME AT US WITH AND MANY OF THEM HAVE. ARE GOING TO MAKE DEMANDS ON US THAT ARE GOING TO BE VERY DIFFICULT. TO TO MEET TO THESE ARE MENTAL HEALTH DEMANDS -- RELATED. TO THE EFFECTS THAT THEY SUFFER AS A RESULT OF THE MODERN BATTLE BATTLEFIELD WHICH WE ARE BECOMING INCREASINGLY AWARE IS LETHAL TO THE YEMEN BRAIN. AND SO MANY OF THE INJURIES ARE NOT SOMATIC BUT MENTAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL. SO -- HAVING SAID THAT THAT THE SO THAT'S THAT NEEDS ASSESSMENT I WILL PRESENT TO YOU. THE MASTER PLAN IS IN A SENSE A RESPONSE TO THE NEEDS ASSESSMENT IT'S GOING TO BE LET'S LOOK AT OUR EIGHT HOMES. AND I'M ALREADY STARTING TO SEE THE EVIDENCE RIGHT NOW IN THIS LAST WEEK WE'RE JUST STARTING TO LOOK AT NEEDS ASSESSMENTS THAT WERE DONE BY FIVE SISTER STATES. I JUST CAME BACK FROM A NATIONAL MEETING WHERE WE HAD THESE CONVERSATIONS I'M CURIOUS TO SEE WHAT THEY ARE LEARNING -- WE'RE GOING TO LOOK AT DO WE HAVE THE RIGHT NUMBER OF FACILITIES ARE THEY IN THE RIGHT PLACES I'M ALREADY STARTING TO DEVELOP CRITERIA AND LET ME SHARE THEM WITH YOU. I THINK ANY VETERANS HOME THAT WE RUN. SHOULD MEET THE FOLLOWING FOUR OR FIVE CRITERIA. IT SHOULD BE ACROSS THE STREET FROM A VA HOSPITAL. I HAVE VETERANS IN YON PHIL AND AND AND IN REDDING WHERE I HAVE TO PUT IN A BUS AND THEY HAVE TO DRIVE THREE HOURS ONE WAY TO EITHER PAOLO ALTO MARTINEZ MAY THIRD -- OR FOR MILEY IN SAN FRANCISCO THEIR NEAREST VA. OF YOU KNOW OF A SET OF FIVE SIX HOUR ROUND NOW A VETERANS HOME. OUR VETERANS HOMES WERE PLACED IN GREAT POSITIONS COM I THINK WHEN THEY WERE BUILT. WE'RE GONNA LOOK AHEAD AND SEE DOES IT MAKE SENSE THAT THEY ALL BE WHERE THEY ARE. THE I THINK THEY SHOULD BE CLOSE TO A VA HOSPITAL I THINK THEY SHOULD BE IN A VETERAN RICH -- DENSITY AREA I THINK THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE GREAT INFRASTRUCTURE WHERE WE CAN -- TREAT THEM -- MORE EASILY IN THE COMMUNITY AND THE DOCTORS NURSES AND ENTRY LEVEL PHARMACISTS AND CLINICIANS AND THERAPISTS SHOULD ALL BE ABLE TO LIVE WITHIN A REASONABLE DISTANCE. OF THE HOMES WHERE THEY WORK IT'S NOT EXACTLY THE CASE IN WEST LA WHERE MOST OF MY RESUME -- MOST MY EMPLOYEES HAVE TO TRAVEL GREAT GREAT DISTANCES -- SAME THING WITH NAPA IT'S A VERY DIFFICULT REGION FOR ENTRY LEVEL EMPLOYEES. TO LIVE ON THE SALARY THAT WE GIVE THEM. SO WE'RE STARTING TO LOOK I THINK -- THE MODEL FOR TEN TWENTY AND THIRTY YEARS FROM NOW MAY BE A LITTLE DIFFERENT THAN THESE LARGE HOMES. BUT I WANT TO GIVE TOO MUCH AWAY AND I'M. UNTIL I START PUTTING THIS STUFF TOGETHER WERE STILL IN THE RESEARCH PHASE OF THIS OF THE WRITING FACE. THANK YOU I THINK THOSE ARE -- SOMETHING THAT MAKES SENSE. DOES MOVE TO SENATOR -- ARCHULETA. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- THANK YOUR PRESENTATION EACH AND EVERYONE OF YOU -- AND SCHECTER RIGHT LIKE COMMENT AND COMPLIMENT YOU RENTS FIRST. YOU TOOK CARE OF THE HEALTH AND WELFARE OF THESE VETERANS THAT WAS PRIOR -- I ALREADY TO YOU YOU WENT AFTER THAT. AND YOU MAKE SURE THEY WERE TAKEN CARE OF AND I AND I SINCERELY THANK YOU FOR THAT. NOW WE COME TO THE BUSINESS AT HAND WHICH IS TAKING CARE OF THE FACILITIES. AND YOU HAD MENTIONED THAT THERE EIGHT FACILITIES. AND YOU FOUND THAT THEY'RE ALL INDEPENDENT. SO I'M AND YOU FOUND THAT THEY WERE INDEPENDENT AS YOU REALIZE THAT YOU SHOULDN'T BE THEY SHOULD BE UNDER ONE UMBRELLA. ONE SUPERVISOR WANT SECTARIAN THAT YOU CHAU CONSEQUENTLY MY QUESTION IS HOW ARE YOU GOING TO BRING BACK TOGETHER WHAT IS YOUR PLAN OF ACTION. FOR BETTY BACK ON BOARD THANKS TO THE LEGISLATURE TWO YEARS AGO WHEN DID WE CREATE OF A SYSTEM OF HOMES. IT USED TO BE THAT THE MILITARY VETERANS CODE RED THERE WAS A CHAPTER FOR YON PHIL THERE'S A CHAPTER FOR CHULA VISTA AND SO ON BUT TWO YEARS AGO THE LEGISLATURE ALLOWED ME TO AMEND THE MILITARY VETERANS CO JUST SAY. VERY SUCCINCTLY THERE SHALL BE A SYSTEM OF VETERANS HOMES IN CALIFORNIA AT YON PHIL READY FRESNO WEST LA AND SO ON BUT IN THAT VERY SIMPLE SENTENCE SAID IN A ASIAN IN ALL ASPECTS OF CLINICAL CARE WE HAD. THIRTY THIRTY FIVE STANDARDIZATION TEAMS REPRESENTED BY PEOPLE THAT EVERYONE OF THE EIGHT HOMES ARE STANDARDIZED EVERYTHING EXCEPT THE BUDGET THAT WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE A STANDARDIZED BUDGET WHERE I COULD. MANAGE THE HOMES AS A UNIT AND I DO HAVE ONE DEPUTY SECRETARY KOBE PETERSON -- FOR YOUR AND KOBE. WHOSE -- RESPONSIBLE FOR RUNNING THE HOMES FOR ME. AND ALSO I'D LIKE TO FOLLOW UP WITH OBVIOUSLY YOU'VE YOU'VE SHARED I'M SURE YOU HAVE WITH ALL YOUR DIRECTORS ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THE AUDIT. FINDINGS BECAUSE THINGS ARE -- MIGHT BE SIMILAR FROM ONE TO THE OTHER LITTLE DIFFERENT FROM ONE TO THE OTHER BUT CERTAINLY -- LEASES AND AND AND PARTICIPATION COMMUNITY PARTICIPATION AND ACCEPT REST SO I'M I'M HOPING THAT THAT YOU HAVE A MEETING. WITH EVERYONE OF YOUR DIRECTORS AND YOU SIT DOWN WITH THEM SURE THEY UNDERSTAND. THAT -- YOUR PLAN YOUR COMMAND YOUR CHANGES ARE EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY -- FROM THIS DAY FORWARD AND THIS WILL BE THE FIRST TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE THE THE AUDIT THAT CAME UP FOUR YEARS FROM NOW. AND EVERYTHING WAS WAS ADDRESSED THE PLAN ESPECIALLY AND AT SOME OF THE OTHER THINGS. BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY THAT WE PUT OUR OUR ADDUCTION ROW AND AND WE KNOW EXACTLY WHERE THE MONEY'S GOING HOW WE ARRIVE TO IT AND EVERYBODY WAS EQUAL. IN PARTICIPATION AND TALK ABOUT PARTICIPATION I I'M REALLY SAD TO HEAR THAT. OUR VETERANS CANNOT SIT DOWN AT THE THEATER -- UNLESS THE TICKET IS BOUGHT FOR THEM AND AT THE END IT TURNS OUT THAT IT MAY BE TURNED AWAY OR WHATEVER IT MIGHT BE BUT TO CHARGE -- OR TO US TO RECEIVE THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR LESS THAN WHAT WE TAKE IN OR VICE VERSA WHATEVER IT MIGHT BE I MEAN. WHERE IS THE PARTICIPATION OF FROM THE DIFFERENT ENTITIES TO REALIZE THAT WE'RE ALL HERE FOR THE SERVICE IN THE BEST INTEREST OF OUR VETERANS? WE NEED TO BRING THEM BACK AND IF I MAY JUST WANT TO CORRECT SOMETHING THAT WAS SAID FROM THE DESK OF THE MUSEUM DOES GIVE FREE ENTRY TO THE VETERANS AFL -- AND THEY DO. I'M NOT SURE WHETHER IT'S FREE TO ANY VETERAN BUT IT CERTAINLY TO THE VETERANS AT THE AT THE HOME IS WANT TO CORRECT THAT FOR THE RECORD. AND PLEASE CONTINUE WITH THE MY COMMENT ABOUT YOUR INDEPENDENT YEAR PLAN TO BRING UNDER EVERYONE UNDER YOUR COMMAND AND HOW YOU -- PLAN TO DO THAT SHOW -- THOMAS CAN ELABORATE BUT IN DECEMBER WE SENT OUT A DIRECTIVE TO ALL EIGHT HOME ADMINISTRATORS WE CALL THEM. THE HOME ADMINISTRATORS ALL EIGHT OF THEM ARE THEMSELVES GOVERNMENT. GOVERNOR'S APPOINTEES AND THEY WERE INSTRUCTED THAT UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES COULD THEY ENTERTAIN THE LEASES OR LICENSES THEY COULD NOT LET THEM OUT -- WITHOUT BEING CLEARED BY MYSELF OR MY DIRECT -- REPRESENTATIVE -- AND I THINK THAT THAT MESSAGE HAS GOTTEN CARE SO GOING BACK TO THESE PLACES SHOULD THEY BE CO SIGNED. BY -- TGS AND YOURSELF. I GOT A MAIL CAN BE FOUR HUNDRED THEY ALSO LEASES BUT I'M YOU KNOW JUST A HANDFUL YEAH SO YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO REVIEW OF BOTH TOGETHER AND COME TO AN AGREEMENT. BEFORE THEY GO OUT. SO YEAH SO -- THE WAY THE PROCESS WORKS IS YES IF I LEASES BEING LET UNDER DIGEST WITH ALREADY WE TECHNICALLY THE ONES THAT HAVE THE SUCH WITH OR TO LET THE LEAST IN THE FIRST PLACE. THEY WITH A CLIENT IN THIS CASE WE WORK TOGETHER IT WOULD BE THE THE HOME GET SOMETHING OUTSIDE OF THAT NORMAL PROCESS IN WHICH CASE AND YES ABSOLUTELY IT SHOULD HAVE GONE THROUGH THE NORMAL. PROCESS I JUST DESCRIBED AND I THINK THE MORE TALK ABOUT OVERSIGHT LITTLE MUTUAL OVERSIGHT BETWEEN BOTH ENTITIES -- WORKING TOGETHER IS WHAT WE'RE HOPING TO SEE THAT ONE SHOULD QUESTION ONE ONE SHOULD QUESTION THE OTHER IN A COURSE THE BUCK STOPS WITH SECRETARY VETERANS AFFAIRS SO -- WITH THAT. EVERY LEE SHOULD BE LOOKED AT REVIEWED ACKNOWLEDGED AND AS A STATE PASSED THE MUSTARD JOE. I HOPE THAT WE'RE GOING IN THAT DIRECTION IN THE FUTURE AND I AND I CONGRATULATE YOU FOR WHAT YOU'VE DONE IN THE PAST. ESPECIALLY THE SERVER REPRESENT OUR VETERANS AND THEIR CARE WELL ONE OF THE THINGS WE'VE BEEN ABLE -- TO CREATE AND IT WOULD HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE WITHOUT ELAINE HOWLS -- OFFICE AND AND ALL WE HAD NO RECORD OF ANY OF OUR LEASE SEASON ARE ARE -- DAY USE AND ARE SQUATTERS AND AND EVERYONE ELSE BUT NOW WE HAVE AND WE COULD HAVE BROUGHT THIS WELL ACTUALLY I THINK THERE IT IS THAT BINDER. THAT HAS EVERY SINGLE LEASE AT THAT -- ARRANGEMENT MINOR AND I DIDN'T. GOOD THANK YOU THANK YOU WE'RE GONNA MOVE TO SENATOR DODD THAN TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER GLORIA FIRST WELL I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE MOVE FORWARD AND I REALLY SUPPORT OF THE WAR YOU KNOW WHERE WE'RE GOING MOVING FORWARD. BUT I GOTTA TELL YA THAT I'M GETTING A LITTLE TIRED OF THE NARRATIVE -- THAT SOMEHOW EVEN AS A STATE REPRESENTATIVE THAT SOMEHOW A SMALL NONPROFIT IN YOUR BILL CALIFORNIA SCHOOLED. THE DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS OR SCHOOLED DG HESS. I MEAN THE REALITY IS -- THEY GO THROUGH A PROCESS THEY'VE GOT A BANKRUPTCY I DON'T I WASN'T INTIMATELY FAMILIAR WITH THAT. THOSE ARE ALL CIRCUMSTANCES BUT IT GETS BACKED NOT TO BLAME BEING -- THE NONPROFIT FOR THESE TICKETS BUT PERHAPS THAT WAS THE BEST THING THE TGS OR THE DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS COULD NEGOTIATE AT THAT GIVEN TIME. BUT MAYBE THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN AN HOUR OR SOMETHING IN THREE YEARS IF YOU'RE A FINANCIAL HEALTH IMPROVES -- THAT WE'RE GOING TO GO BACK TO GIVING THE VETERANS -- WHAT THEY NEED IN AS YOU POINTED OUT SENATOR THEY RICHLY DESERVE AND I THINK THAT THERE PROBABLY AT THAT STAGE RIGHT NOW? IN IT I GUESS WHAT I JUST WANT TO SEE IS THAT WE NOT -- TAKE THIS FROM THE SUBLIME TO THE RIDICULOUS I I APPRECIATE THOSE REMARKS CENTER THANK YOU -- BUT I THINK THAT THAT BOLSTERS WHY ARE -- THE THEY ARE IMPEDIMENTS TO ROUTINE RENEGOTIATION OF THINGS THAT. THINGS CHANGE I TOTALLY DISAGREE WITH YOU I TOTALLY DISAGREE WITH YOU ON THAT LONG TERM LEASES ARE APPROPRIATE WHEN YOU'RE PUTTING INVESTMENT IN THE HOME. WHEN YOU'RE PUTTING THAT THERE IT'S AN AGREED UPON BEFORE YOU DO ANYTHING TGS IS INVOLVED WITH THAT THEY OBVIOUSLY WERE THE CAL THAT WAS AND -- INVOLVED WITH THAT IN A LONG TERM LEASE WAS THE ONLY WAY THAT THAT WAS EVER GOING TO HAPPEN AND I'M SORRY. TGS DEALS WITH LEASES ALL THE TIME -- FOR REAL ESTATE THROUGHOUT THE STATE ENTIRE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- THAT I GUARANTEE YOU. WILL HE JUST MADE IT CLEAR THAT THEY DO HAVE EXEMPTIONS FOR LONGER TERM LEASES BUT IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT OTHER TYPES OF LEASES IN COMMUNITIES. OUTSIDE OF CAL BET THEY NEGOTIATE LEASES EVERY SINGLE DAY SO YOU CAN DO LONG TERM LEASES TO PUT IT OFF ON THE FACT THAT THAT'S THE ISSUE -- REALLY NEGLECTS THE FACT THAT IN PREVIOUS WHAT NOT NOT YOU GUYS WITH THE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION. CALVET INDEED YES DROPPED THE BALL SO HOW THEN PLEASE EXPLAIN TO ME HOW THEN DO I THEN GO BACK TO THE THEATER MANAGEMENT AND SAY IT'S BEEN SEVEN YEARS NOW FURTHER ON HOW DO I LOOK THAT'S TAKEN HOW DO WE TAKE ANOTHER LOOK AT THIS NOW. I HAVE NO. NO RECOURSE BUT THAT'S NOT THEIR FAITH. IN WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS IS PREVIOUS STATE DEPARTMENTS GOT SCHOOL BY THIS LITTLE TINY NONPROFIT. IN YOUR BILL THAT'S ALMOST THAT SOUNDS RIDICULOUS TO ME. BUT I WILL GUARANTEE YOU THIS ASSEMBLY MEMBER -- CURRY AND I IF YOU WANT THIS EVEN INVOLVED. WILL GO WITH YOU TO THOSE NOT PROFITS. IT TALK ABOUT THINGS THE BENEFIT. OUR VETERANS AND MAKE SURE THAT OUR VETERANS GET THEIR FAIR SHARE AND MAKE SURE THAT. EVERY LEASE -- HERE IS THAT IF WE CAN BE HELPFUL IN THAT REGARD WE'D LOVE TO DO IT BUT SIRIUS YEAH I APPRECIATE THOSE COMMERCENTRE DAUGHTER ONE OF THE THINGS YOU HAD MENTIONED WAS. YOU KNOW IF FOR INSTANCE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE THEATER THE THEATER IS IN BETTER FINANCIAL HEALTH. PERHAPS WE CAN RENEGOTIATE SOME THESE PROVISIONS BECAUSE IN TWENTY TWELVE THE SETTLEMENT WAS THEY REMOVED. THE FREE TICKETS FOR THE VETERANS RIGHT AND IF THEY'RE IN A BETTER FINANCIAL STATE WHY DO WE NOT REINSTITUTE THAT SO THERE'S ACTUAL BENEFIT TO VETERANS I THINK IS WHAT YOU'RE SAYING. THAT'S CORRECT. TOTALLY RIGHT OKAY WHY APPRECIATE THAT I THINK -- FROM CAL THAT'S PERSPECTIVE THEY'RE JUST HAVING A LITTLE BIT OF FRUSTRATION BECAUSE THEY FEEL LIKE THEY'RE LOCKED INTO THESE LONG TERM. LEASES WITHOUT THE ABILITY TO SOME OF THE PROVISIONS ESPECIALLY AS WE HELP VETERANS -- CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD AND SO I GUESS THAT'S REALLY WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS HOW DO WE BENEFIT VETERANS AND MAKE SURE THAT THAT VETERANS ARE BENEFITING FROM ALL OF THESE LEASES AND WHAT'S THE BEST WAY FOR US TO DO THAT I HEARD EARLIER TESTIMONY THAT YOU WERE. ACTUALLY LOOKING AT LITIGATION TO POSSIBLY MOVE THROUGH THAT I KNOW -- THE SIR WHEN ASKED EACH YES ABOUT THE FIVE YEAR LEASE AND MOVING FORWARD TO HAVE ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS ON THAT BUT I KNOW. HAVE SOME COLLEAGUES OF QUESTIONS BEFORE WE MOVE INTO THAT -- THAT'S NEXT FOR ME BUT LET'S MOVE TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER GLORIA. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN -- IF THEY GIVE A SECTOR OF FOR YOU. YOUR COMMENTS AND TO THE STATE AUDITOR'S WELL WHO ALWAYS DOES AN INCREDIBLE JOB THANK YOU SO MUCH -- I FIRST OFF KANSEN THE CHRISTMAS CONCERT SEEMS LIKE A REALLY BAD IDEA AND IT SEEMS LIKE EVERYONE SHOULD FIGURE OUT A WAY TO MAKE SURE THE VETERANS CAN HAVE A CHRISTMAS CONCERT FREE POLITICAL ADVICE -- BUT THE THE THE THE CONCERN THAT I'M INTERESTED IN AND I AND OR OR NOT NO THAT ORDINARILY WE WOULD AVOID PERSONALITY CHART KINDS OF CONVERSATIONS IN PUBLIC THAT WAS ALREADY MENTIONED -- THAT THE TWO PRIMARY. EMPLOYEES WERE DISMISSED AS THAT TO HEAR THAT CORRECTLY IN THE BY THE AUDITOR'S OFFICE YES -- I A KNOWLEDGE IN THAT THE BUT WILL PORT -- THE AUDIT. POINTS OUT THAT THESE ARE VIOLATIONS OF LAW IS THAT THE ONLY CONSEQUENCE OF THE ACTIONS AT YON PHIL -- AT SO SO FOR THAT FOR THOSE FOR THOSE TWO EMPLOYEES -- YEAH AS YOU MENTION I KNOW IT'S IT'S NOT A AN ANSWER ANYONE LIKES TO HEAR BUT YOU THERE ARE. THERE ARE -- PERSONNEL ISSUES WE CAN NECESSARILY DISCUSS THEM TOO MUCH DETAIL -- I CAN SAY THAT -- HOLD SOMEONE TO AN AGREEMENT. THAT EITHER DOESN'T EXIST OR WAS APPROVED ALBEIT INAPPROPRIATE WITH AN APPROPRIATELY WITH AN APPROPRIATE TERMS -- BYE. BYE PREVIOUS LEADERSHIP AT THE HOME. BUT BUT NEITHER OF THOSE EMPLOYEES ARE CURRENTLY STATE EMPLOYEES AT NIGHT AND TO BE ADMINISTRATOR IN EXECUTIVE THAT ARE NAMED IN THE REPORT NEITHER OF THEM ARE STILL ON THE PAYROLL TO STAY CALIFORNIA -- I I CAN SPEAK TO WHETHER I CAN SPEAK TO WHETHER THEY'RE STILL EMPLOYEES WITH THE STATE -- A BIG AND CLEAR AND I'M PLACE WITH US ALI MAY HAVE OR RIGHTS OF SQUARE IN THE STATE I SEE -- THE DOW TO BE QUITE A DEBBIE QUESTION FOR ADDITIONAL FOLLOW UP I WOULD THINK FOR THE COMMITTEE AS WELL AS TO UNDERSTAND -- IF THERE VIOLATIONS OF LAW I MEAN I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE MAY BE A STANDARDS OF PRACTICE AND OTHER THINGS BUT YOU KNOW JUST A BRIGHT LINE OF VIOLIN LANA SHOULD THE CONSEQUENCE OF THIS IS CIVIL OR CRIMINAL -- BUT YOU KNOW IF WE HAVE PARENTS OF COLLEGE AGE KIDS GOING TO JAIL FOR GET THE KIDS INTO I'VE THE COLLEGES PAIN BRIBES I MEAN THE I THIS SEEMS OF A SIMILAR CALIBER AT LEAST IN TERMS OF STEALING FROM VETERANS AND AND MISAPPROPRIATING FUNDS IN EXECUTING LEGAL CONTRACTS AND IT. SEEMS LIKE A LOT GOING ON HERE THAT MAY GO BEYOND -- JUST PERSONAL DISMISSAL AND I JUST GENTLY ONE ASKED THAT QUESTION I RECKON IN PUBLIC THEY COULD SELECT QUESTION I WAS IN MY FOR THE SECRETARY. IS THAT I UNDERSTAND WHAT THE FOCUS OF THE AUDIT WAS JOHN BILL GIVEN THE NATURE OF THE LEASES THAT ARE AVAILABLE THERE CONTRAST IN WITH SOME OF THE OTHER HOMES. HOW MUCH OF THIS IS THE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE INVOLVED HOW MUCH OF THIS IS ABOUT A CULTURE I MET CITY VA AND WHAT CAN YOU SAY IF IT IS IF IT'S IF IT'S BOTH WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO CHANGE THE CULTURE CITY VIA? A CULTURE WHERE WE'RE BY THE LEASES ORIGINATED AND SOCIAL CULTURE WELL I MEAN IN TERMS OF THE ABILITY FOR SINGLE ADMINISTRATOR TO HAVE. THIS KIND OF OF I WOULD SAY RECKLESS BEHAVIOR AND WELL AT OKAY DO YOU THINK IT'S JUST THE ADMINISTRATOR AT A NOW THAT THAT PERSON IS NO LONGER THERE. WE GENERALLY COOL OR DO YOU DO YOU ARE ALL MINISTERS OPERATING ON THIS SORT OF LEVEL THAT YOU KNOW NOT AND IT IS CERTAINLY NOT ANYMORE EVERYONE OF THE ADMINISTRATORS KNOWS THAT THEY CANNOT DO ANYTHING IN THAT MANUAL WITHOUT IT BEING CLEARED BY US. BUT CAN I JUST WIND THE CLOCK BACK TO TWO THOUSAND THE YEAR TWO THOUSAND WHICH IS IN OUR MEMORY. THE IT WAS JUST YEAH BILL YON PHIL WAS CAL VET. IT WAS HEADQUARTERED THERE ANY GREW UP OVER CENTURY AND AS A% CONSEQUENCE HISTORICALLY IT DEVELOPED A SENSE OF AUTONOMY AND THE THE ADMINISTRATORS THAT WERE PUT IN THERE FELT NO NEED. IT BACKED UP BY HISTORY TO COMMUNICATE THEIR ACTIVITIES WHETHER IT WAS TO BUILD UP THINGS ON THE CAMPUS AND OR TO ENTER INTO AGREEMENTS WITH THE COMMUNITY FOR THE PLACEMENTS OF OF THESE AMENITIES LIKE A GOLF COURSE -- AND THEY DID IT. AND WITH SUPPORT OF ALL KINDS OF OUTSIDE INFLUENCES [inaudible] AND AND SO. AS THE TIME HAS GONE BY WE'VE SORT OF CORRALLED OUR AUTHORITY A LITTLE BIT MORE STRICTLY -- INSULT THAT LAST DECEMBER WE NOW HAVE AN A DIRECTIVE FROM ME THAT THEY CAN'T DO THIS BUT YOU CAN SEE THAT THIS IS JUST BEEN AN ACCRETION OVER HISTORY WHERE. HOME ADMINISTRATORS AT YON PHIL HAD A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF AUTONOMY AND EXERCISED. SO THE ANSWER I'M SORRY DID YOU HAVE FOR NOW. I WAS JUST GOING TO ADD -- THAT'S THERE'S I KNOW AND I KNOW THE SIMILAR QUESTIONS ASKED EARLIER ABOUT YOU KNOW -- AT LEAST SOME OF THE WANNA BE WRONG BUT ABOUT -- THE THE EMPHASIS ON THE ON THE CAMPUS PART OF THE ISSUE IS JUST SIMPLY THAT THE SIZE YEAH I GET THAT ME CONNECTION OF YOUR BILL OTHER HOMES DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE. EXCESS SPACE FOR EXAMPLE TO HAVE TIME TO REDUCE ITS WHERE I'M GOING IN AND I THINK THE SECRETARY JUST ANSWERED THAT THERE IS A CULTURE AT LEAST BECAUSE OF THE HISTORIC NATURE OF YOUNG. CENTERS BUT THE REASON I ASK IS THAT I RECOGNIZE YOUR BILL IS AS IS ADVANTAGED IN REAL ESTATE RIGHT BUT YOU EASILY COULD HAVE -- INTERESTING OF RELATIONSHIPS CONTRACTS WITH OTHER THAN THE INITIATORS COULD HAVE WITH OTHERS IN THE COMMUNITY THEY DON'T HAVE ANY DO WITH REAL ESTATE -- BUT WOULD BE EQUALLY AS PROPS OFFENSIVE TO THIS BODY -- IF THEY WERE KNOWN SO THAT HAS THE QUESTION ABOUT THE CULTURE BUILDING AROUND THIS YOU'RE SAYING. THE ADMINISTRATOR IS NOW GONE. HOPEFULLY NO LONGER ON THE STATE PAYROLL DECEMBER'S CONCERT A GENERAL LIABILITY FOR THE STATE BUT THAT THE CULTURE ITSELF AND THE SAFEGUARDS HAVE BEEN BUILT AROUND. BEHAVIOR OF THIS KIND WE PROBABLY WOULDN'T SEE AGAIN UNDER THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES. M. BECAUSE OF A PENDING LAWSUIT I WOULD LOVE TO ELABORATE THAT WHAT YOU JUST SAID IS TRUE. THERE WAS A HISTORICAL -- A SENSE OF FREEDOM ON THE PART OF PEOPLE THAT RAN THAT CAMPUS THAT WAS DIVORCED FROM OVERSIGHT FROM CAL THAT. THAT ENDED I PERSONALLY HIRED -- THE OF THE PRESENT ADMINISTRATOR AND WE HAVE A GOOD UNDERSTANDING AND A GOOD WORKING RELATIONSHIP AND ENJOY YOUR CONFIDENCE TODAY YES RIGHT. AND I GEN BUT THANK YOU. WE'RE GONNA MOVE TO ASSEMBLY WOMAN AGUIAR-CURRY THAN TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER -- PETRIE-NORRIS THAN TO SENATOR DRAWS SO I JUST HAVE A REALLY QUICK COMMENT WHEN SOME OF THESE LEASES WERE EXTENDED FOR SO MANY YEARS I THINK WE HAVE TO REMEMBER IS THAT IT'S A LOT OF PRIVATE INVESTORS THAT WERE FROM UP IN THAT. IN THE AREA THAT HELP FUND SOME OF THESE SO FOR INSTANCE THE MUSEUM WAS PAID BY A LOT OF LOCALS THEY CONTINUE WANT US TO SUPPORT THAT THAT MUSEUM. A THE INTENT IS ALWAYS TO BE A BENEFIT TO THE COMMUNITY SO JUST AS LIKE A TO JUST TO CLARIFY IS THAT -- THE MUSEUM WAS A PRIVATE -- TO HELPFUL AS WELL AS OTHERS THE COMMUNITY TO MAKE SURE THAT STAYS THERE. AND SO THAT BASICALLY IS PAY FOR ITS JUST AS ON THE PROPERTY OF YEAH AND I BELIEVE THAT MISTER SECRETARY HAD COMMENTED THAT THEY WERE. THAT THE MUSEUM AT LEAST OFFERS A FREE ADMISSION. TO TO THE VETERANS THAT UTILIZE THE FACILITIES ARE CORRECT. AND THE OTHER ONE IS THEY HAVE A ROOM IS FROM THE LOCAL COMMUNITY HAVE PAID FOR THE POOL AS WELL SO THEY'VE BEEN TOLD FOR THIS YEAR THEY CANNOT USE THE POOL FOR THE COMMUNITY [inaudible] ASSEMBLY. WHO WAS TOLD WHAT? WE'RE TOLD THAT THEY CANNOT USE THE POOL THIS YEAR WHO WHO WAS TOLD AND THE CITY OF A YOUNG. THAT'S THAT'S NOT THAT'S NOT TRUE WE JUST OFFER THEM A LEASE AND WE'VE -- WE WE REDUCE THE RENT FROM ONE DOLLAR. TWO ZERO IT MIGHT BE BRAND NEW BUT AS OF A COUPLE WEEKS AGO THOUGH IT WAS LAST WEEK BEFORE THEIR TOWN COUNCIL MEETING. THEN MY BAD I WAS NOT WITH US OKAY THAT'S RIGHT. BUT WE HAVE WE CERTAINLY NOT KICKING THE TOWN OUT OF THEY RUN THAT POOL SINCE. WELL OVER TEN OR 206-415-2000 -- FIVE THEY HAVE PUT SOME IMPROVEMENTS IN AWHILE AGO -- THE PERSON INTO THE WATER -- BUT LIKE I SAID WE WE ENJOY THAT RELATIONSHIP I KNOW IT'S A BENEFIT TO KIDS IN THE COMMUTER AND OTHERS IN THE COMMUNITY WERE WILLING TO OPEN. CONTINUE TO KEEP THAT CAMPUS OPEN FOR THAT. AND WE'RE GOING TO DROP LIKE I SAID THE RENT DOWN. TO ZERO BECAUSE IT MEETS MY CRITERIA. OKAY THANK YOU OKAY THIS TIME WILL MOVE TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER PETRIE-NORRIS. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE AND THANK YOU FOR ALL THE GOOD WORK THAT YOU ARE DOING I'M. SO THE INITIAL AUDIT THAT WAS ON THE SUBJECT WAS FROM OCTOBER OF TWENTY THIRTEEN AND AS I'M SURE WHERE THE TITLE IS WASTEFULNESS FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH STATE CONTRACTING REQUIREMENTS. AN INEXCUSABLE NEGLECT OF DUTY WHICH IS QUITE I'M SO I FIND MYSELF KIND OF CON FOUNDED THAT IT'S FIVE AND A HALF YEARS LATER AND WE'RE STILL GRAPPLING WITH SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT WERE RAISED IN THAT INITIAL REPORT. IS UP UNDERSTAND TWO THINGS ONE HOW IS IT POSSIBLE THAT IT'S FIVE AND A HALF YEARS LATER AND WE'RE STILL HAVING THIS CONVERSATION AND SECOND HOW CAN WE BE CONFIDENT THAT WE'RE NOT GOING TO STILL BE HAVING THIS CONVERSATION. IN FIVE AND HAVE A GREAT YEARS THAT'S GREAT YEAH YEAH THAT'S REALLY THE CENTRAL QUESTION THANK YOU -- SHOW I I ALREADY GAVE YOU AND A LITTLE BIT A SHORT WHILE AGO OF RESPONSIBLE TWENTY FOUR SEVEN THREE SIXTY FIVE FOR THE LIVES OF THREE THOUSAND PEOPLE IN THOSE HOMES. AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY WERE FED AND CLOTHED AND AND SUPPORTED IN EVERY POSSIBLE WAY IT DIDN'T LEAVE ME A LOT OF BAND WITH TO GO INTO OTHER THINGS BUT WE DID START AND AS I MENTIONED ALREADY. WE AFTER THAT AUDIT IN TWENTY THIRTEEN WE STARTED MAKING SURE THAT EVERYONE OF THE LEASES THAT WE ENTERED INTO ADHERED TO THE FIVE YEAR. MAXIMUM TIME AND ALL THE OTHER REQUIREMENTS THAT -- THE THE LEASING MANUAL THAT THE STATE PUTS OUT -- REQUIRES US TO DO. WHERE WE FELL SHORT AND I'D I CAN TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS IS NOT IN THE THE LEASES AND? WE NOT ONLY ENTERED INTO NEW RELEASES BUT WE WERE NEGOTIATED OLDER LEASES TO MAKE SURE THE FORMAT AND THE LANGUAGE COMPORTED WITH THE NEW STANDARD. BUT WHAT'S THE WORD I'M LOOKING FOR FOR THE OTHER ACTIVITIES THAT WE DAY USE EAH SO. I DID NOT HAVE THE TIME TO GO IN A LOOK INTO POKE INTO THE WAY I DID WHEN THE TWO OF US. AT THE THREE OF US WENT INTO EVERY ROOM ON THAT CAMPUS. WE THE DAY USES THE THE PICNICS AND THE BICYCLE RACES ON THE WALKS FOR CHARITY BY THE WAY. CHARITIES THAT RAISE A LOT OF OFTEN. AN EMBARRASSINGLY LITTLE AN AMOUNT OF THAT IT DOESN'T COME SOME OF THEM RAISE MONEY -- THIS ONE COMING UP IN APRIL THAT RAISES A LOT OF MONEY FOR VETERANS IN GENERAL STATEWIDE. BUT MY NEW STANDARD GOING FORTH IT WILL BE TO BENEFIT THE RESIDENTS ON THAT CAMPUS. BUT I DIDN'T LOOK AT ALL OF THOSE THINGS AND I DIDN'T LOOK AT THE PEOPLE WHO WERE USING OUR PROPERTY WITH NO ARRANGEMENTS AT ALL AND I DIDN'T LOOK AT THE SUBLET LEASES -- I DON'T KNOW IF I'M SUPPOSED TO THERE'S A DANCE COMPANY THAT USES THE THEATER I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT ARRANGEMENT IS. THE LITTLE GIRL FALLS AND BREAKS HER ANKLE WHO GET SUED I DON'T KNOW BUT I WILL FIND OUT. AND I WILL MAKE SURE THAT WERE INDEMNIFIED -- AT THAT ALL PARTIES ARE COVERED THAT THE STATE IS PROTECTED. SO I THINK GOING FORWARD WE ARE QUITE CLEAR THAT OUR PARTNERSHIP WILL WHAT DO YOU CALL ME BACK IN SIX MONTHS OR SIX YEARS WILL. WILL BE ABLE TO SHOW WE'RE NOW ON A STRAIGHT AND NARROW PATH. BUT THE LONG TERM LEASES I WILL -- I'M SADDLED WITH THEM UNLESS THERE'S SOME OTHER KIND OF RELIEF THAT I CAN'T IMAGINE. OKAY WELL THANK YOU I APPRECIATE YOUR CANDOR AND I DO ALSO APPRECIATE THE WAY THAT YOU DID PRIORITIZE THAT THEY CARE ABOUT TRENDS AND I THINK IT IS A TREMENDOUS ACHIEVEMENT THAT YOU YOU KNOW TOOK THEM FROM A TWO STAR RATING. TO SPEND THE BEST FACILITIES IN CALIFORNIA SO I THINK THAT'S REALLY SOMETHING TO BE PROUD. THANK YOU WILL MOVE -- TO SENATOR DRAWS IN FOR QUESTIONING [inaudible] THANK YOU. WHEN I STILL FIND HARD -- TO UNDERSTAND THANKS SAID AS SAID BY SENATOR DODD IS. HOW THIS COULD HAPPEN? UNDER THE NOSE OF A DEPARTMENT LIKE THE G. S. AND CAL THAT'S YOU KNOW IT'S THERE'S SOME FOLKS ON THE GROUND. WHO DID WRONG? BUT HOW DID THAT GET. PASSED [inaudible] THESE DEPARTMENTS. UP ON IT AND OVER AND OVER HOW TO GET PASSED TO ME IT'S NOT SO MUCH. WE COULD WE COULD FIGURE OUT WHAT WENT WRONG WITH SOME LEASES. BUT MY CONCERN IS HOW IT EVEN HAPPENED IN THE FIRST PLACE. BECAUSE THIS IS NOT SOME. ERROR IS SOME DEPARTMENT THAT'S WAY OUT THERE THAT NOBODY EVER CARES ABOUT. CALVET CINDY GS. ARE HUGE TO DOUBLE THE GS HUGE DEPARTMENTS AND YOU'RE ONLY RESPONSIBLE MORE BIG RESPONSIBILITIES THESE LEASES. HOW DOES THAT HAPPEN THAT THE HIGHER UP LOW TAKE PLACE? WELL IF I COULD IF I COULD -- OFFER SOME PROTECTION TO MY COLLEAGUES FROM THE G. S. I THINK WHEN A A LEASE WAS NEGOTIATED -- INFORMALLY BETWEEN THE HOME ADMINISTRATOR AT DOWN FELL BACK IN THE EIGHTIES AND THE NINETIES -- AND ARRANGEMENTS WERE MADE WITH VARIOUS ENTITIES AND THEN BROUGHT TO D. G. S. IT PROBABLY LOOKED BONAFIDE IT PROBABLY LOOKS GOOD I I AT LEAST. I MEAN HOW DOES IT LOOK GOOD. SO YEAH -- IT'S A IT'S A VERY VERY FAIR QUESTION IT REALLY IS I WOULD SAY -- AND THIS KIND OF GOES BACK TO SOMETHING THAT CENTER DOT HAD TIED KIND OF ALLUDED TO I DON'T WANT TO DEMONIZED ANY OF THE IN PARTICULAR LESSEES IN THIS PROCESS -- THERE ARE SOME LEASES -- WHERE EVEN EVEN THOUGH SO MANY THINGS RUN FABLE THERE MAY HAVE BEEN GOOD EXPLANATIONS OF THE TIME FOR THEM? UNFORTUNATE BECAUSE THERE ISN'T IMITATIONS HARD TO ACTUALLY SAY THAT NOW. LOOKING BACK IN A TWENTY THIRTY YEARS LATER SOME CASES WE GO BACK AND WE THINK THAT THIS IS THE SAME KIND OF CRAZY -- IN THOSE INSTANCES YES IT DOES LOOK LIKE IT IT ALTERNATELY WAS NEGLIGENT ON ON BOTH DEPARTMENTS PART IN MAKING SURE THAT THESE WERE IN THE BEST INTEREST OF TIME AGAIN BIT BY THAT YOU BY VIRTUE HINDSIGHT. UNLESS THERE WAS SOME MITIGATING CIRCUMSTANCES -- THESE THESE TO GET THROUGH. I I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR ASIDE FROM AND I REALLY APPRECIATE. YOUR LOOKING FORWARD THE MASTER PLAN TAKING SOME CORRECTIONS BUT I'D LIKE TO KNOW WHAT CORRECTIONS IT CAN BE MADE AT A HIGHER LEVEL. NOT JUST ON THE GROUND. I CAN RESPOND FOR TGS AT LEAST I MEAN. AS I LIEU TO BEGINNING MY TESTIMONY YOU KNOW WE WE HAVE TWO DIFFERENT GROUPS AT TGS THAT HISTORICALLY DO LEASING ONE THAT GOES OUT TO THE PRIVATE SECTOR IN LEASES THEIR SPACE AND ONE THAT LEASES STATE SPACE. THE GROUP AT LEAST STATE SPACE -- IS QUITE SMALL -- AND IT'S IT'S ESSENTIALLY BEEN SOMETHING OF A CORNER FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS -- IN ORDER AND THE GROUP THAT ACTUALLY GOES OUT AND LEASES PRIVATE SECTOR SPACE BECAUSE IT'S LARGER IT'S MORE ABOUT SB TOO FAR FAR MORE TRANSACTIONS THERE'S A LOT MORE PROCESS A PROCEDURE THAT'S BUILT AROUND THE PASSING SO ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS THAT WE DID WAS. WHEN I? CAME ON BOARD AND IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN WE WE TOOK THOSE TWO GROUPS AND WE MERGE THEM TOGETHER -- SO NOW THERE'S A SINGLE PERSON RESPONSIBLE FOR STATE LEASING IN GENERAL SECOND THING WAS THOSE TWO GROUPS DID HAVE DECENTRALIZED THESE MANAGEMENT THEY'RE KIND OF RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR OWN -- DEPOSITING OF FUNDS AND VALIDATING THAT -- RENEWALS ARE HAPPENING ON TIME AND SO WE'VE PULLED THOSE FUNCTIONS OUT AND CENTRALIZE THEM AS WELL SO THERE'S OF ESSENTIALLY OF A THIRD PARTY ACCOUNTABILITY WITH THAT SECTION TO MAKE SURE THAT -- LEASE PAYMENTS ARE BEING COLLECTED TIMELY THE WE'VE DONE THOSE REORGANIZATIONS THE SECOND PIECE AND THIS IS THIS IS WHAT I LAMENTED THE AUDIT IS YOU KNOW AS I LOOK BACK AT SOME LEASES THAT EXIST ON THE APPLE THE SOME OF THE MORE RECENT ONES. EVEN THE ONES POST TWENTY THIRTEEN I SEE INDICATIONS THAT THEY WERE DONE IN IT IN KEEPING WITH HOW WE CAN EXPECT TO SEE FAIR MARKET VALUE DETERMINED I CAN'T PROVE IT UNFORTUNATE BECAUSE THE POOR DOCUMENTATION AND SO WE DO. WE DID -- MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS NOT ONLY A POSSIBLE TEN THAT MIRRORS -- THE OTHER LEASING GROUPS -- DOCUMENTATION SENATOR FAR MORE BUST BUT WE BEGAN TRAINING STAFF TO THAT EFFECT -- WE HAVE ALSO LOOKED AT EACH OF THESE AREAS THE AUDITOR -- IDENTIFIED SO AGAIN THAT'S FOR MARKET VALUE IN LIEU BY PUBLIC BENEFIT -- WE'VE GOT SOME LEASES THAT IN SOME CASES WERE SUCH POORLY ENACTED THAT ARE IN A FIFTY YEAR LATE NIGHT OF VETERAN SUMS BUT OTHER. OTHER LOCATIONS WITH A LONG TERM LEASES AT CERTAIN RATES AND WE HAVE TO BRING THEM TO FOR MARKET VALUE -- AFTER THOSE TERMS EXPIRE IN ALL THOSE CASES WE'VE GOT POLICIES NOW TO ADDRESS SPECIFICALLY HOW TO DO THOSE THINGS -- PROOF WILL BE IN THE PUDDING WHETHER WE CAN SHOW THAT WERE ACTIVELY MANAGING TO THOSE THINGS -- AND I THINK THE AUDITOR AND THEIR RESPONSE TO OUR OUR RESPONSES SO FAR HAVE BEEN. YES YOU WITH POLICIES IN PLACE TO GET APPROVED ACTUALLY DOING IT BECAUSE THERE IS A KIND. ALL RIGHT THANK. SO RAZA WAS TALKING ABOUT THE LEASES WELL A LOT OF US WERE TALKING ABOUT THE LEASES AND SEEMS TO BE LIKE SOME DISCREPANCY SO I'LL JUST GET SOME CLARITY FROM D. G. S.. THE SIMS -- THERE SEEMS TO BE SOME DISCREPANCY BETWEEN WHAT THE AUTHOR PRESENTED WENT -- CODE SECTION YOUR FOLLOWING OVER AT THE GS AND LET ME JUST ASK ONE GENERAL QUESTION. SENSORS MULTIPLE CODE SECTIONS WHICH ONE DOES THE GS FOLLOWER FOLLOWER DOESN'T LIKE WHAT CODE SECTION FOR ONE LEASES ANOTHER CODE SECTION FOR ANOTHER LEASE. SO -- I CAN IS THAT WHAT QUESTION ONE OF TWO WAYS YOU KNOW BECAUSE DID YES BECAUSE WE HAVE A LEASING AUTHORITY FOR MOST APARTMENTS -- WE HAVE SORT OF OUR DEFAULT AUTHORITY WHICH IS GOVERNMENT CODE -- ONE FOUR SIX SEVEN ZERO THAT IS -- KIND OF IT'S IT'S OUR IT'S OUR GO TO NINE TIMES OUT OF TEN BECAUSE MOST APARTMENTS DON'T HAVE ANY SPECIAL LEASE AUTHORITY -- WERE SPECIAL PROVISIONS ABOUT LEASING -- HOWEVER -- IF THERE IS A PIECE OF PROPERTY THAT IS -- ACCESS TO DEPARTMENTS FORESEEABLE NEED WE CAN ENTER INTO VERY VERY LONG TERM ARRANGEMENTS UNDER A DIFFERENT SECTION OF GOVERNMENT CODE THERE'S A SECTION GOVERNMENT COLOSSUS TO ENTER INTO LEASES FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING. SO DEPENDING ON THE SPECIFIC DEAL POINTS AND THE USE OF THE LAND WE DO HAVE DIFFERENT LEASE AUTHORITY WE PAY THAT. TOO IN THE CASE OF CALVET -- MILITARY VETERANS CO TEN TWENTY THREE REALLY SHOULD CONTROL -- AND SO FROM TGS AND YOU JUST LEGAL PERSPECTIVE THAT DOES ALLOW FOR A LONG TERM LEASES -- AGAIN WE GENERALLY PREFER GOING BACK TO SOMETHING CENTER DOT SAID IN LESS THERE ARE -- EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES LIKE THIS A CAPITAL INVESTMENT OR THERE ARE SOME SOME NEED TO DO SOMETHING LONGER TERM BUT GENERALLY ARE DEFAULT IS FIVE YEARS WHICH IS WHY AS THE SECRETARY MENTIONED. POST TWENTY THIRTEEN ALL THE LEASES ENTERED INTO HAVE BEEN A FIVE YEAR DURATIONS. AND SO FEW ENTRANCES LONG TERM LEASES ARE ADDITIONAL PROTECTIONS OR OTHER CRITERIA THAT YOU REQUIRE. MOVING FORWARD A FEED WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THEOLD OUT IT'S MOVING TO THIS YEAR'S AUDITS. THE LACK OF NOT HAVING AN OPT OUT CLAUSE FOR INSTANCE FOR THE STATE OR CERTAIN CRITERIAS WEREN'T MATT OR EVEN THE BENEFITS FOR VETERANS AND AND THIS CASE. I MEAN DO WE HAVE THAT MOVING FORWARD IS THAT -- CRITERIA THAT'S NOW ESTABLISHED BECAUSE OF THE AUDIT -- CAN YOU COMMENT ON THAT ESPECIALLY. FOR MORE LEASES -- THROUGH LONG TERM LONGER THAN FIVE YEARS. SURE I MEAN I THINK -- SO WE WE DO USE A STANDARDIZED OF A LEASE FORM TEMPLATE -- BECAUSE THE MAJORITY RELEASES ARE DONE DEPARTMENTS THOSE TWO HAVE STANDARDIZED INSURANCE PROVISIONS THEY'RE STANDARDIZED TERMINATION CLAUSES -- AND WE WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH OUR TURN IS TO MAKE SURE THAT COVERS THE VAST MAJORITY AGREEMENTS -- IF WE WERE TO ENTER INTO SOMETHING LONG TERM -- ESPECIALLY SOMETHING THAT WAS NATION A GOOD EXAMPLE IS -- YOU KNOW THERE WAS A LEGISLATION THAT WAS PASSED A COUPLE YEARS AGO TO ALLOW CENTER INTO A LONG TERM LEASE FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR DIFFERENT DEPARTMENT -- THAT HAD A SEPARATE OUR FEE BUILT INTO IT HAD VERY SEPARATE AND TAILORED LEASE TERMS THOSE BECOME VERY FOCUSED ON THAT PARTICULAR ARRANGEMENT SO YES. IF WE'RE DOING SOMETHING LONG TERM ESPECIALLY SOMETHING YOU SHOULD WE DO FAIRY INVALID OR MAKE SURE THAT -- WE DON'T JUST USE THE SENATE LEASE TERM WE TAILOR IT TO THAT PARTICULAR LEAST OPTICAL NEGOTIATION COTTONS OUT JUST A POLICY OR REGULATION THAT YOU HAVE NOW IMPLEMENTED SINCE I DON'T KNOW HOW FAR BACK WHEN. WAS THAT SOMETHING THAT. WE SHOULD REQUIRED BY STATUTE -- IT IS YEAH IT'S IT'S MARKETS ARE POLICY -- I'M NOT AWARE OF ANY SUCH TôI REQUIREMENT BUT SUCH IT DOESN'T GO INTO SPECIFIC DETAIL ABOUT WHAT TERMS CONDITIONS IMPOSED FOR THE MOST PART OF THE SET UP TO OUR DISCUSSION. OKAY. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU FOR THE CLARITY LET ME ASK -- IF THERE'S ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS OF THE DíAS -- HERE AGAIN SAYING NONE I THINK WE'LL MOVE TO CLOSING BUT LET ME JUST THANK YOU GUYS FOR BEING HERE LIKE TO THANK THE AUDITOR HER TEAM -- CAL THAT'S AND ALSO THE CHANCE FOR BEING HERE THINK AT THE END OF THE DAY WE'RE ALL TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE HELP VETERANS -- AND MOST EFFICIENT -- IT WE CAN -- THAT'S RIGHT. RIGHT BEFORE WE CONTINUE WITH CLOSING LET ME ASK IF THERE'S PUBLIC COMMENTS. ALLRIGHT IF PUBLIC COMMENT IF YOU CAN PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME AND IF YOU'RE WITH AN ORGANIZATION ORGANIZATION AS WELL -- PLEASE -- L'IMAGE COMES TO TWO MINUTES WE'D APPRECIATE THAT THANK THANK YOU THANK YOU APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY I'M WITH AN ORGANIZATION CALLED THE COUNTY OF NAPA I'M A NAPA COUNTY SUPERVISOR DIANE DILLON. AND THE OROVILLE -- FACILITY LIES WHOLLY WITHIN MY SUPERVISORIAL DISTRICT IN VERY I'M VERY PROUD OF THAT. I APPRECIATE -- THE DOCTORS OVERSIGHT OF THE MEDICAL NEEDS. I WOULD URGE. YOU TO CONSIDER THAT ALL OF THIS DID NOT SAY WHY THE HECK DID THEY DO IT THAT WAY BACK THEN -- BUT THERE'S A CONTEXT FOR EACH OF THESE DECISIONS THAT WAS MADE YES IN SOME CASES THERE'S ONLY ORAL HISTORY BUT I DON'T THINK YOU'VE HEARD ALL THE ORAL HISTORY TODAY. SO I WOULD -- APPRECIATE -- THE OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO PARTICIPATE. REFERENCE WAS MADE TO THE NAPA COUNTY -- BEING IN IN THE HOSPITAL THERE IS NO FEDERAL CLINIC. IN NAPA COUNTY FOR VETERANS -- WE WERE PROVIDING SERVICES AND WE BELIEVE WE SHOULD BE GOOD PARTNERS WITH -- THE YOUNG FILL UP VETERANS HOME AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE STE WE STRIVE TO BE WE PROVIDE LIBRARY SERVICES BECAUSE THOSE ARE RESIDENTS. OF OUR COUNTY EVEN THOUGH THEY HAVE THEIR OWN LIBRARY WE AUGMENTED THEIR SERVICES AT NO COST TO THEM SO THERE ARE MANY SITUATIONS. WHERE THERE'S A A RECIPROCITY THAT DOESN'T INCLUDE -- REQUIRE MONEY -- BUT WAS -- TACITLY NO I WOULD HATE TO SEE AYE THOSE RELATIONSHIPS -- BE ELIMINATED IN THIS PROCESS TO TAKE EVERYTHING TO SOMETHING THAT'S BY THE BOOK -- THE TOWN OF YOUR BILLS NOT HERE TODAY THEY PUT OVER MILLION DOLLARS INTO THAT POOL THEY'VE ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT WHERE THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE RESPONSIBLE ANYMORE FOR THEM. YEARLY MAINTENANCE AND INSTEAD HAVE PASSES FOR THE RESIDENTS -- BUT I YOU KNOW. THAT MAY BE THE BY THE BOOK OF HOW YOU WANT TO RUN THINGS BUT MAYBE THE WAY THAT AGREEMENT WAS ORIGINALLY MADE WAS REALLY. BETTER FOR THE IN THE BIGGER PICTURE IN THE LONGER RUN SO PLEASE LOOK AT THE CONTEXT OF THESE DECISIONS AND LET'S NOT ACT WITH TOO MUCH HASTE UNTIL WE HAVE ALL THE FACTS ON THE TABLE THANK YOU. THANK YOU SUPERVISORS COMMENTS YEAH I THINK WE'RE LOOKING FOR WHEN WHEN. US AREAS IF WE CAN ESPECIALLY WHEN IT -- IS OFFERING SERVICES BUT ALSO WRITTEN AGREEMENTS AS WELL SO THAT EVERYBODY UNDERSTANDS PARAMETERS WHICH WERE MOVING FORWARD. PLEASE CONTINUE PUBLIC COMMENT. THANK YOU -- CHAIRS AND MEMBERS I AM I AM FOUNDER AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER VETERANS RESOURCE CENTER OF AMERICA. ALSO SERVED IN THE ARMY AND IN VIETNAM. NINETEEN SIXTY SIX SIXTY SEVEN VETERANS RESOURCE CENTER IS A COMMUNITY BASED VETERANS SERVICE AGENCY WITH NEARLY A FIFTY YEAR HISTORY OF RYAN SERVICES. FOR VETERANS AND ONCE AGAIN I I THANK YOU FOR ATTENDING TO THIS ISSUE AND ALLOWING ME TO SPEAK HERE OVER THE YEARS THOUSANDS OF VETERANS HAVE BEEN FORTUNATE SECURE HOME AT YON PHIL. MANY OF OUR CLIENTS ACTUALLY -- HAVE COME THROUGH OUR SERVICES AND AND ARE NOW RESIDENTS OF YOUNG WILL AND JADA WILL HAVE SERVE THEM VERY WELL. THE INVALUABLE STATE RESOURCES DEDICATED TO VETERANS CAN CONTINUE ITS MISSION SERVING AGING VETERANS. AND DO SO MUCH MORE BYE BYE OPINION ACROSS THE REGION THROUGHOUT THE STATE. THERE ARE HOMELESS VETERANS WHO NEED HOUSING EMPLOYMENT AND TRAINING ANOTHER SERVICES INCLUDING WORKING VETERANS YOU NEED AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THESE. ALL VETERANS DESERVE A CAREFUL THOUGHTFUL AND TRANSPARENT PLANNING PROCESS THAT FULLY EXPLORES HOW WE MAY BETTER USE IS GREAT RESOURCE. ACCORDING TO THE AUDIT YA UNTIL VETERANS HOME AND PROPERTY IS NOT ALWAYS OPERATE IN THE BEST INTEREST OF VETERANS BUT WE CAN ALL AGREE THAT THESE PROBLEMS NEED TO BE ADDRESSED TO THE DEPARTMENTS OF MASTER PLAN IN THIS IS VERY VERY IMPORTANT -- THAT YOU SHOULD ADDRESS THE AUDITS CONCERNED JUMP RULES ESTABLISHED AND CHARGED TO SERVE VETERANS FIRST. AND NOT TO BE A FACILITY PRIMARILY FOCUSED ON ON VETERAN ISSUES THEREFORE. WE FULLY SUPPORT INVESTMENTS TO IMPROVE IN TO INVEST IN SKILLED NURSING CENTER UPGRADED YON PHIL. SKILLED NURSING CARE IS AN URGENT NEED FOR AGING VETERANS AND AS YOU'LL SEE BY THE COLOR OF MY HAIR. I MAY BE ONE OF THOSE VETERANS. BUT OUR VETERANS POPULATION IS LARGE THEIR NEEDS ARE MANY AND LAND AND RESOURCES ARE SCARCE JA RULE HAS A BIG FOOT PRINT AND WITH CAREFUL PLANNING. COULD HOUSE OF RIDING OF NEEDED SERVICES VETERANS WE UNDERSTAND THERE ARE COMPETING INTERESTS FOR NON VETERAN USES OF YON PHIL. CAN THE ALA CHALLENGES MANY OF THOSE USES. WE DID NOT CATEGORICALLY OPPOSED ALTERNATIVE NON VETERAN USES AT YON PHIL BUT VETERAN USAGE IS PARAMOUNT. ALTERNATIVE USES SHOULD NOT CIRCUMVENT OR DIMINISH THE PRIMARY PURPOSE OF SERVING VETERANS. WE ARE NOT SUPPORTING THE SALE OF ANY PART OF THE OUT BILL PROPERTY AT THIS POINT BUT IF NOT RETURN USES ARE PERMITTED OR PORTIONS OF THE PROPERTY SOLD. THAN REVENUES GENERATED MUST BE EXCLUSIVELY ALLOCATED DO BETTER -- BENEFIT VETERANS DEPARTMENT IS CURRENTLY ENGAGED IN DEVELOPING A MASTER PLAN FOR YON PHIL. WE URGE YOU TO SEEK VETERAN COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT. IN THESTAKEHOLDER PROCESS SPECIFICALLY WE ASK THAT YOU INCLUDE. CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION VETERANS SERVICE AGENCY IN THE MASTER PLANNING PROCESS CATHERINE HAS A STATE WIDE EXPERIENCE IN VETERANS CARE. CURRENTLY INVOLVED IN THE WEST LA PROJECT AS WELL ONE OF OUR PARTNERS INCLUDING AS I SAID WEST LA THIS EXPERIENCE CAN BE A VALUABLE RESOURCE AS YOU MOVE FORWARD -- I'M DEDICATED.

SOME OF THOSE ISSUES -- THROUGH THE B. C. P. PROCESS OF MAYBE AN INTERNAL -- ODDITY. PLEASE OFFICIAL PUBLIC COMMENT. GOOD MORNING -- MY NAME IS -- IT ROOM WARM. I AM THE LEGISLATIVE CO CHAIR. OF THE í ALLY COUNCIL. AS SUCH WE ARE THE GROUP. OF REPRESENTING THE VETERANS AT YON PHIL -- TO THE ADMINISTRATOR AND WHEREVER ELSE MIGHT BE S.. I HAVE TWO PAGES WHICH I'M PASSING OUT -- TO EACH OTHER THERE'S TWO OF THEM FOR EACH ONE OF THE COMMITTEES. I AND I WON'T READ MY REMARKS -- BUT I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE JUST A MOMENT. TO ANSWER SOME OF THE QUESTIONS RAISED IN THE COURSE OF YOUR THING. I'VE BEEN AT YON PHIL TEN YEARS. AND SO I HAVE A FAIRLY GOOD PICTURE. OF AT LEAST THE TEN YEARS OF ITS HISTORY. AS TO WHY THE THE WASN'T FALL APART AFTER CONTRACTS IN THE TWENTY THIRTEEN THERE WAS IN FACT A BILL BY YAMADA -- THAT -- INTENDED TO DO THAT. AND IT WAS -- HI JACKED IS THE WORD SOMETIMES USED TO IN THE SENATE. THIS ASSEMBLY BILL HIJACKED IN THE SENATE. IN ORDER TO PROVIDE CGV EIGHTIES -- START A OF HAVING THE STATE WIDE. MORALE WELFARE AND RECREATION -- THAT HAD NOT YET OCCURRED. SO SO THE FIRST EFFORT TO DO THAT WAS. DIRECTED TO SOMEWHERE ELSE. AS TO WHY THE TICKETS WERE TAKEN Y.. THE ALLIED COUNCIL IS A TIME STRENUOUSLY OBJECTED TO THAT. WE WERE NOT TOLD ABOUT IT UNTIL AFTER THE FACT. AND MY UNDERSTANDING. BECAUSE I HAD A LONG CONVERSATION WITH THE WITH THE FEEDER PERSON THAT NEGOTIATED THAT. IS THAT WAS AN IDEA THAT CAME OUT OF THE BLUE. FROM THE CVV A LAWYER WHO IS NEGOTIATING THEIR CONTRACT -- ANDO I THINK THAT THE THEATER WOULD BE OPEN. TO FIND YOU SOME DIFFERENT ARRANGEMENTS. THAT I MIGHT JUST ALSO ADD THAT THE GOLF COURSE -- PROVIDES GREEN FEES. AND IN CART. FOR THE MEMBERS SO THEY ARE SOMEBODY WHO DO IN FACT HAVE SOME DIRECT. CONTRIBUTION MY TWO POINTS. MY TWO POINTS ARE. WHERE IS THE MONEY? THERE'S BEEN MONEY TAKEN OUT FOR LEASES. NONE OF IT HAS BEEN IN THE HOT DIDN'T DEPOSIT. TO THE MWR OLE FUN. IN YOUR FILL NONE. AND WE'RE GETTING READY TO CONSIDER NEXT YEAR'S BUDGETS. WILL BE GOOD ENOUGH FOR A WAS. TEN THOUSAND OR A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS ADDITIONAL THAT MIGHT BE SPENT. SO THAT'S MY FIRST POINT. THIS MONEY IS. IS A DIRECTED TOWARDS. THE END OF YOUR PHONE FROM SOME OF THE LEASES. AND WE'D LIKE TO SEE SOME OF THAT BENEFIT. THE SECOND POINT [inaudible] IS. MEMBERS VETERANS OF THE HOME. LEAST OUR OWN. ARE NOT INVOLVED. IN DISCUSSIONS AND POLICIES WERE SHOULD BE. AND THE LATEST. OUTRAGE I WOULD SAY. THERE'S A DEVELOPMENT OF THE POLICY. FOR WHAT IS THE BEST INTEREST OF THE VETERANS AND NO VETERAN WAS PASSED. NEED I SAY MORE. SO I'VE GIVEN YOU SHOULD COMMITTEES. TWO PAGES LEANING UP TO THESE POINTS. I WOULD BE GLAD. TO THANK YOU AND I'M PRETTYSURE. EIGHT OF BOTH OF ARM LEGISLATOR TODAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU THANK FOR COMMENTS AND FOR YOUR SUBMISSION AND THOSE OF BEEN DISTRIBUTED TO MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AS WELL. PLEASE ADDITIONAL PUBLIC COMMENT THANK YOU I'M LARA RAFFERTY AND THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE NAPA VALLEY MUSEUM DOWN FILL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR ALL THE THAT YOU'RE DOING ON BEHALF OF THE VETERANS AND WE UNDERSTAND IT'S OF DIFFICULT PROCESS TO GO BACK IN. AND TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT HAPPENED LONG AGO THE GOOD NEWS WITH REGARD TO THE MUSEUM IS THAT THE PERSON WHO ACTUALLY SIGNED A RELEASE IS STILL VERY ACTIVE WITH MUSEUM SO IF ANYBODY WOULD LIKE -- TO PUT IMPACTS ON THIS WERE HAPPY TO OFFER HIM UP -- TO HELP FILL IN SOME BLANKS. TWO QUICK FACTS I WANTED TO CORRECT -- OR CLARIFY PERSONAL YES WE DO OFFER FREE ADMISSION TO VETERANS OF RESIDENTS OF THE VETERANS HOME. EVERY DAY -- WE ALSO ARE A PARTICIPATING MEMBER OF THE NATIONAL ENDOWMENT FOR THE ARTS BLUE STAR PROGRAM VERY PROBABLY WHICH AT OUR OWN EXPENSE -- FOR THREE MONTHS OF THE YEAR WE OFFER FREE ADMISSION TO EVERY MEMBER OF THE ACT TO DO WHAT WE ALWAYS OFFER FREE ADMISSION TO ACTIVE DUTY MILITARY. ALL YEAR BUT THIS INCLUDES RESIGNED DURING EVERY VETERAN IT'S EVERY RESERVIST AND WE AND THEY HELP US PUSH IT OUT AND NATION WIDE AND IT'S BEEN A REALLY POPULAR PROGRAM. ON THE OTHER THING I WANTED TO ALSO CLARIFY IS THAT WE HAVE A GROUND LEASE WITH THE WITH THE STATE WE DON'T HAVE TIME WHICH IS A VERY IMPORTANT CLARIFICATION I THINK IT WAS A MAYBE A LITTLE LOST IN THE AUDIT REPORT ON INADVERTENTLY -- WE'VE DEVELOPED THE LAND WE BUILT THE BUILDING WE MAINTAIN THE BUILDING AS IT IN SOME CASES WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO SCRAPE IT OFF THE THE GROUND WHEN WE LEAVE. SO -- WE ARE IN YOUR THIRTY ONE OF A OF A LONG LEASE WE SPENT MILLIONS OF DOLLARS REYES FROM THE COMMUNITY TO BUILD OUR BUILDING -- IF YOU ADVERTISE THAT OUT OVER EVEN JUST A FEW YEARS THE THIRTY YEARS THIS FIRST A LOOK AT HALF THE LEASE PAYMENTS WELL ABOVE MARKET RATE -- BUT WE WE WANT YOU TO UNDERSTAND THAT BUT THEM THE FUNDAMENTAL THING I WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU ALL INTERESTED WITH THAT THE PICTURE YOU'RE HEARING TODAY. IS SO AT ODDS WITH THE REALITY RIGHT NOW WE HAVE A CALLED WALT DISNEY'S SHIP WITH THE WALT DISNEY FOUND AND I HAD MANY RAILROAD TRAIN GEEKS THERE WERE LIVING AT THE VETERANS HOME. BUT THERE'S A WHOLE HECK OF A LOT OF ON AND SOME OF THEM COME EVERY DAY AND THEIR THEIR HAND IN HAND WITH THE LITTLE KIDS IN SCHOOL THE SCHOOL CHILDREN AND GROUPS THAT COME THROUGH -- AND THEY'VE BECOME SORT OF INFORMAL DOCENTS IN MANY CASES THEY VOLUNTEER IN GOOD NUMBER THEY TURN OUT AND TO ALL OF OUR EXHIBITIONS OUR NEXT ONE IS PICASSO WE DID A WONDERFUL JULIA CHILD EXIT WHICH WHAT INTERNATIONAL PLAN AND THEY WERE SO PROUD OF IT -- THE BETTER I CAN'T SPEAK FOR ALL THE VETERANS BUT WE DO HAVE A GREAT RELATIONSHIP WITH COM ALSO WITH THE TELEVISION STATION AND THEY OFTEN WILL COME OUT WE HAVE THE FIRST MOM IN SPACE AN ASTON NASA ASTRONAUT. ANALLY FISHER AND THAT WAS WHAT THAT WAS BROADCAST TO THE FOLKS BACK AT THE VETERANS HOME WE REALLY DO FEEL THAT WERE SO CLOSELY CONNECTED TO THEM. AND I'M REALLY PROUD TO TELL YOU THAT WE SOUGHT AND OBTAINED COUNTY FUNDING OF THIS. START THIS PROCESS BY YEAR AGO AND WE ARE BUILDING A PERMANENT HISTORY CASE DEDICATED TO THE COUNTRY THE HISTORY AND CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE VETERANS HOME. AND IT'S GOING TO INCLUDE A ROTATING SERIES OF EXHIBITS THAT BRINGS FROM THE PRIVATE COLLECTION OF THE VETERANS HOME LIBRARY OBJECTS THAT HAVE NEVER BEEN SEEN BY THE PUBLIC FOR SEVEN THEY HAVE A COLLECTION OF SWEETHEART PILLOWS FROM WORLD WAR. TWO THEIR UNIFORMS THERE. BATTLES OR THINGS LIKE THAT AND SO WHAT WE REALLY YOU. PLEASE DON'T BE -- EVER IN ANY DOUBT THAT THERE IS A GREAT BENEFIT FROM THE MUSEUM AND THE LAST THING I WANT TO SAY TO YOU IS THIS. THE THIRTY YEARS AGO OR THIRTY ONE YEARS AGO. PEOPLE ACTUALLY WE HAD OTHER ALTERNATIVES OF PLACES TO BUILD THIS MUSEUM WE WERE ENCOURAGED TO COME BECAUSE THE LINCOLN THEATER WHICH WAS WAS THERE ALREADY -- THERE WAS A DESIRE ON THE PART OF THE COMMUNITY TO BUILD SOMETHING THAT IS EXISTS NOWHERE ELSE IN OUR REGION AND THAT IS TO SIDE BY SIDE CULTURAL INSTITUTIONS. THEY'RE OPERATING AT AT A WORLD CLASS LEVEL. GREAT ART AND AND CULTURE TO THE VETERANS BUT ALSO TO BRING THE COMMUNITY THERE TO ENJOY THAT CULTURE. SIDE BY SIDE WITH THE VETERANS AND IF I BELIEVE IF YOU ASK THE THE VETERANS AND YOU ASKED THE COMMUNITY MEMBERS WHO FUNDED THIS. TO THE TUNE OF YOU KNOW TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON ANY BY THE WAY I INCLUDING THAT THE SIX HUNDRED AND SEVENTY ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS WE HAVE TO PAY. EVERY YEAR -- TO KEEP OUR OB ARE MUSEUM OPERATING NONE OF WHICH IS SUBSIDIZED BY THE STATE I THINK THAT YOU WILL FIND YOU GOT TREMENDOUS VALUE AND WE WE HAVE. EXERCISE OUR OPTION TO RENEW OUR LEASE WE AND TO BE THERE TILL THE YEAR TWENTY FORTY AND BUT WE WOULD LOVE TO BE PART OF THE CONVERSATION AND MAKE SURE THAT WE CONTINUE. TO BE OF AS MUCH BENEFIT TO THE BUT THAT ARE AS HOT AS WE CAN. THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR PUBLIC COMMENTS IN THE CLARIFICATION BUT ACTUALLY EVEN. IN YOUR COMMENTS SHOWING THE DIRECT BENEFIT TO VETERANS AND THE PROGRAMS ARE DOING. THAT. ADDITIONAL PUBLIC COMMENT. THANK YOU MY NAME IS PATRICIA MUSCOVITES AND I AM THE GENERAL MANAGER OF LINCOLN THEATRE. AND I HAVE A STATEMENT THAT OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS ASKED ME TO READ AT THIS HEARING. WHICH I THINK WILL ANSWER A FEW QUESTIONS THAT HAVE COME UP AND CORRECT SOME INACCURATE STATEMENTS YEAH FIGURE PLEASE TRY TO DO THAT WITH THE TWO MINUTES AFTER YOU COULD ALWAYS A BIT THE STATEMENT AS WELL FOR THE COMMITTEE. TO WOULD BE HAPPY TO YES -- ELECTRONICALLY OR A COPY WITHOUT MY WRITING ON IT. THANK YOU. OKAY SO I'LL TRY TO BE FAST WE WOULD ADDRESS THE FINDINGS OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR HER REPORT ISSUE TO THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE AUDIT COMMITTEE DATED JANUARY. TWENTY NINE NINETEEN TWENTY NINETEEN REGARDING FRIENDS OF LINCOLN THEATRE THE NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION THAT BUILT AND OPERATES LINCOLN THEATRE FACILITY AS IT AS IT IS KNOWN TODAY. WE KNOW THAT THE AUDITOR RECEIVED COMMENTS ABOUT THE OUT A REPORT FROM CALVET AND TGS WHICH INCLUDED AS PART OF THIS AUDIT REPORT. BUT DID NOT SOLICIT ANY COMMENTS FROM THE ENTITIES IT AUDITED. EITHER DURING THE AUDIT OR AFTER THE AUDIT WAS COMPLETED. WE BELIEVE SUCH FEEDBACK FROM LINCOLN THEATRE MIGHT HAVE CORRECTED SOME FACTUAL ERRORS IN THE AUDIT REPORT AND PROVIDED NECESSARY BACKGROUND REGARDING LINCOLN THEATER'S OPERATIONS AT THE VETERANS HOME IN YOUR BILL. WE'RE SURPRISED THE DETERMINATIONS WERE MADE WITHOUT HEARING FROM UNDERSTANDING AND INVESTING ALL RELEVANT FACTS AS IT RELATES TO THE PRINCIPAL PARTIES INVOLVED INCLUDING THE TENANTS. THERE'S NO EQUITY FAIRNESS OR DUE PROCESS IN THIS MANNER AND APPROACH. IN ORDER TO GET THE REAL A FULL PICTURE OUR VOICES AND HISTORICAL EVENTS AND FACTS MUST BE INCLUDED TO BALANCE OUT THE RESULTS. ANYTHING SHORT OF THIS IS ON DEMOCRATIC AND CAPRICIOUS. FIRST AND FOREMOST WE WOULD LIKE TO KNOW THE LINCOLN THEATRE AS PART OF ITS TENDENCY CONTRIBUTED MORE THAN TWENTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS. TO RENOVATE AN AGING AND UNDER UTILIZED THEATER WHICH WAS ORIGINALLY BUILT AT THE VOTE SOME IN. NINETEEN FIFTY SEVEN WITH THOSE PRIVATE FUNDS CONTRIBUTED THE BUILDING WAS TRANSFORMED INTO A MODERN MULTI USE STATE OF THE ART TWELVE HUNDRED SEAT PERFORMING ARTS CENTER. SINCE THAT MAJOR RENOVATION WE'VE CONTRIBUTED MORE THAN FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND IN ADDITIONAL IMPROVEMENTS AND SIGNIFICANT REPAIRS TO THE BUILDING. OUR CURRENT STRATEGIC PLAN ALSO INCLUDE THING AND WE ARE pAN EXCELLENT SHAPE. AS YOU CAN UNDERSTAND SUCH SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL INVESTMENT IN REAL PROPERTY IS NOT POSSIBLE WITH A SHORT TERM LEASE OR OPERATING AGREEMENT. WE NEED TO TELL OUR FOUNDERS AND OUR PATRONS AT LINCOLN THEATRE WILL BE AROUND LONG ENOUGH TO SEE A RETURN ON ITS INVESTMENT. WHEN THE AUDITOR'S APPRAISER NOTED THAT REASONABLE MARKET RENT FOR THE THEATER IS ONE POINT THREE SIX MILLION PER YEAR? THE AUDITOR FAILED TO NOTE THAT THE VALUE UNDERLYING THAT LARGE RENTAL AMOUNT WAS CREATED BY LINCOLN THEATRE WHEN IT CONTRIBUTED THE MONEY TO RENOVATE AND MAINTAIN THE PROPERTY. IN EFFECT IT IS EXACTLY WHAT LINCOLN THEATRE HAS ALREADY PAID TO OCCUPY THE PROPERTY. ANOTHER FINDING BY THE AUDITOR WAS THAT ARE OPERATING AGREEMENT DID NOT ALIGNED WITH THE INTERESTS OF THE VETERANS SOME RESIDENTS. SPECIFICALLY THE REPORT MENTIONS THAT LINCOLN THEATRE DOES NOT PROVIDE FREE OR DISCOUNTED TICKETS FOR TO OUR PERFORMANCES. OUR ORIGINAL AGREEMENT AS NOTED PREVIOUSLY PROVIDED A LARGE ALLOTMENT OF FREE TICKETS TO VETERANS SOME RESIDENTS BUT CALVET INSISTED ON RENEGOTIATING THE AGREEMENT TO REPLACE A FREE TICKET PROGRAM. IN EXCHANGE FOR AN INCREASE IN RENT WHICH DOUBLED. THE ASSUMPTION OF RESPONSIBILITY FOR CERTAIN EQUIPMENT AND SYSTEMS INTEGRAL TO THE BUILDING AND FURTHER GIFTING OF ASSETS FROM LINCOLN THEATRE TO CAL. IN EFFECT CALVET WAS MOVING SOME OF ITS FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY BACK TO THE RESIDENTS OF THE VETERANS -- CURRENTLY THE VETERANS HOME ACTIVITIES OFFICE ADJOURNMENTS HOW MANY TICKETS RESIDENTS WANT FREAK SHOW AND PURCHASES THOSE TICKETS OUT OF M. W. R. FUND. WE ALSOPROVIDE LIMITED OF FREE TICKETS TO THE RESIDENTS OF THE VETERANS HOME ON OUR OWN BEHALF AND WOULD BE WILLING TO REVISIT THIS MODIFICATION IN OUR OPERATING AGREEMENT. WITH CALVET. WE SUPPORT GETTING AS MANY VETERANS HOME RESIDENTS TO THE LINCOLN THEATRE IT'S POSSIBLE IT'S OUR MISSION TO PROVIDE ACCESS TO THE ARTS IN OUR COMMUNITY ESPECIALLY TO VETERANS. THE VETERAN THE VETERANS HOME RESIDENTS STAGE MANY ACTIVITIES AT THE THEATER. FOR EXAMPLE THE THEATER HAS HOSTED A BLACK HISTORY MONTH PRESENTATION. BOOK SIGNINGS BALLROOM DANCES IN TOWN HALL STYLE MEETINGS WITH VETERANS AND THEIR ELECTED OFFICIALS. WHICH YOU GUYS WERE WERE GRACIOUS ENOUGH TO ATTEND. THAT RECENTLY THE VETERANS HOME USE THE THEATER TO DO A STATE OF THE HOME PRESENTATION FOR THE VETERANS AS WELL. WE DO NOT CHARGE MARKET RATES IF ANYTHING AT ALL FOR THESE VETERAN LET ACTIVITIES. WE DO OUR BEST TO ALIGN THE ACTIVITIES OF THE LINCOLN THEATER WITH THOSE OF THE VETERANS HOME IN AN EFFORT TO CONTINUE OUR HEALTH IN COLLABORATIVE RELATIONSHIP. OUR OTHER ACTIVITIES INTEGRATE THE VETERANS HOME WITH THE NAPA VALLEY AS A WHOLE. THERE ARE MANY LOCAL RESIDENTS WHO WOULD NEVER HAVE VISITED THE VETERANS HOME IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR THE ACTIVITIES OF LINCOLN THEATRE. WE SERVE OVER FIFTY EIGHT THOUSAND PATRONS AND OFFER A HUNDRED FIFTY LIVE PERFORMING ARTS EVENTS PER YEAR. WE OFFER CHILDREN'S CONCERTS OVER EIGHTEEN HUNDRED CHILDREN PER YEAR. FOUR HUNDRED PRESCHOOLERS RECEIVE FREE ARTS AND MUSIC CLASSES EVERY WEEK WE PROVIDE COMMUNICANTS ARTS THAT BRING. SEVENTEEN HUNDRED ATTENDEES PER YEAR DEAR PROGRAMS OF CLASSICAL AND POPULAR MUSIC. WE OFFER YOUNG ARTISTS THE OPPORTUNITY TO PERFORM IN A STATE OF THE ART PERFORMANCE VENUE INCLUDING STUDENTS FROM JUSTIN SIENA NAPA INVENTED HIGH SCHOOLS. AS WELL AS AN APPLE VALUE SOMETHING. WE OFFER FREE AND DISCOUNTED RENTAL AND ORGANIZATIONAL SUPPORT TOO MANY NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS WHO HOST EVENTS AT THE THEATER EACH YEAR. WE ALSO HELP SUSTAIN ART AND CULTURE IN NAPA VALLEY WE HAVE SEVERAL MAJOR ANNUAL EVENTS INCLUDING VESSEL NAPA VALLEY LIVE IN THE VINEYARDS NAPOLI FILM FESTIVAL. ENOUGH I JUST GOT AWAY IN MUSIC IN THE VINEYARDS. WE ALSO SERVE AS THE HOME TO SYMPHONY NAPA VALLEY. ORGANIZATIONAL RESTRUCTURE TO PROVIDE THE ONGOING SUPPORT REQUIRED THE LEADER IN THE ARTS AND CULTURE SECTOR OF NAPA VALLEY WE HAVE A STRONG BOARD OF DIRECTORS A CONSERVATIVE MANAGEMENT STYLE DEDICATED STAFF AND MANY VOLUNTEERS. WE LOOK FORWARD TO SERVING THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND NAPA VALLEY COMMUNITY FOR YEARS TO COME. PLEASE COME JOIN US AND SPENT SOME TIME IN THE THEATER YOU WILL BE GLAD YOU DID SINCERELY FRIENDS OF LINCOLN THEATRE PORT DIRECTOR. THANKS FOR PUBLIC COMMENT AND OUT OF MANAGING THE TOBY. ADDITIONAL DISCUSSIONS BETWEEN THE THEATER CAL VETS AND THE LEGISLATORS ARE REPRESENT AREA I KNOW THE BOARD DOES BOTH OF THAT AND JUST TO CLARIFY THERE WAS NOT A BANKRUPTCY FILED -- IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE THERE WAS A PETITION TO DISSOLVE THE ORGANIZATION WHEN IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE FINANCES WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THE ONGOING OPERATION. AND THAT PETITION FOR DISSOLUTION WAS RESCINDED. BECAUSE WE WERE ABLE TO RENEGOTIATE WITH CAL THAT. TO MAKE THE AGREEMENT SUSTAINABLE AS WELL AS GETTING SOME ADDITIONAL FUNDING. BUT IT WASN'T A BANKRUPTCY THANK YOU REPUBLICAN. MY NAME IS JAMES MUSSON I'VE BEEN RESIDING IN INDEPENDENT LIVING AT THE ULTRA VETERANS HOME FOR CLOSE TO FIFTEEN YEARS. AND I HAD MOVED IN BEFORE THE RENOVATION OF THE CONTAINER WAS COMPLETED. I WANTED TO CONCUR WITH SOME OF THE REMARKS MADE BY MY COLLEAGUE GOOD WITH MARK. THERE IS NOT ENOUGH. INPUT. BY THE VETERANS RESIDING AT THE HOME. IN THE DECISION MAKING PROCESS. WANTED TO QUOTE A SHORT PHRASE FROM THE REPORT. BEST INTERESTS OF THE HOME. WHO MAKES THAT DECISION? HOW IS THAT DECISION MADE? LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT THE ADMINISTRATOR AT THE ON FULL HOME. RESIDES AT THE HOME. SO HE SHOULD HAVE AN IMPORTANT. INPUT. TO THE SECRETARY IN DETERMINING THE BEST INTEREST OF THE HOME. BUT IN PUTTING THAT INPUT TO THE SECRETARY. THAT ADMINISTRATORS SHOULD HAVE A TOWN HALL OR OTHER MEANS OF GETTING THE INPUT FROM THE VETERANS SO THEY KNOW WHAT THE VETERANS OPINION AND FEELINGS ARE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. FOR YOUR COMMENTS ON BUT ONE ONE OF THE COMMON SHOOT ME. ON DECEMBER EIGHTH TWENTY FIFTEEN CHAIRMAN NAVA THE LITTLE HOOVER COMMISSION. SENT A LETTER TO THE GOVERNOR AND THE LEAD LEGISLATORS. THAT BETTER COULD HAVE BEEN WRITTEN TODAY THAT LETTER SAID IMMEDIATE ACTION WAS NEEDED. TO ADDRESS THE INFRASTRUCTURE PROBLEMS AT THE HOME. AND HERE AT THE HOME IN YOUNG FEEL. WE'RE STILL WAITING. THANK. THANK YOU. YES GOOD THERE'S ADDITIONAL PUBLIC COMMENT HEARING AND SEEING -- NINE WILL RETURN BACK TO MEMBERS OF THE HELLO MISTER WITH THE TI QUALITY.

THEIR WILLINGNESS TO MOVE FORWARD AND TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES AND CORRECT THE SYSTEMIC. ISSUES WE'VE SEEN IN. WHETHER IT'S A TWENTY THIRTEEN EARNED THE AUDIT BEFORE THAT SOME OF THE SYSTEMIC PROBLEMS THAT WE'VE IDENTIFIED. I KNOW -- THE AUDITOR'S IDENTIFIED ALSO A SIXTY DAY A SIX MONTH ON A ONE YEAR CHECK IN FROM THE RECOMMENDATIONS. I AM HOPING THAT I WILL HEAR FROM HER THAT EACH OF THE AGENCIES AFFECTED WILL BE -- COOPERATING WITH HER MOVING TO AND ALSO THE ISSUES RAISED IN THE RECOMMENDATIONS -- I'M -- I THINK I I SEE NODS SO I'M ASSUMING THAT YOU GUYS ARE WILLING TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR ON THAT BUT LET ME MOVE -- TO CENTER ACTUALLY DO HAVE SOME CLOSING REMARKS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I'D LIKE TO THANK OUR OUR COLLEAGUES FROM THE ASSEMBLY THE SENATE -- FOR BEING HERE AND BEING FROM PATIENT WITH -- THE AUDIENCE AND EVERYONE OF US AND ESPECIALLY LIKE TO THANK YOU GENTLEMEN AS WELL YOUR STAFF -- THE AUDIT YOU DID A GREAT JOB BY I WAS VERY IMPRESSED WITH THAT IT IT REALLY OPENED UP MY EYES THE DOORS SAID WE ALL NEED TO LOOK THROUGH -- BUT MISTER SECRETARY ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THAT I YOU HAD MENTIONED. IT WAS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT IF A VETERAN LIVE TO FAR AWAY FROM -- FROM A VETERANS HOSPITAL. THAT -- YOU LOOK INTO THAT I THINK THAT ARE YOU NOT WITHIN FORTY MILES I THINK THE LIMIT FORTY MILE YOU SHOULD SHOW CENTER I I HAVE TO BE CAREFUL TO SEPARATE OURSELVES FROM THE FEDERAL VA. AND YOU'RE REFERENCING THE THE THE RECENT ADAPTATION OF THE CHOICE ACT CALLED THE MISSION ACT. WHICH WILL GIVE. OF THOSE VETERANS IN THE UNITED STATES. WHO HAVE ACCESS TO CARE AT A VA HOSPITAL THE OPPORTUNITY SHOULD THEY BE OUT OF -- OUT OF RANGE IF YOU WILL OR WITHIN AND THEY CAN'T GET AN APPOINTMENT AT A FEDERAL Vì THEY WILL BE GIVEN THE OPTION TO GO SEE CARE IN THE COMMUNITY IF APPROVED BY THEIR VA HOSPITAL. THE ONLY MINOR IMPEDIMENT TO THAT HAPPENING IS THEY HAVE TO FIGURE OUT A FUNDING MECHANISM FOR THAT YET OKAY WELL PLEASE LOOK INTO THAT BECAUSE I THINK THAT WOULD. SOLVE THE PROBLEM IMMEDIATELY I KNOW THAT -- WHEN I SERVED -- AND IN MY POSITIONS AND REPRESENTING VETERANS AND I WAS DOWN IN TEXAS SOMEWHERE AND WE'RE ABLE TO DO THAT. AND THE VETERANS WERE ABLE TO GO TO THE LOCAL HOT SO PLEASE LOOK INTO THAT THE OTHER THING I'D JUST LIKE TO COMPLIMENT YOU FOR STANDING UP IN OWNING. THE SITUATION AND ACCEPTING THE AUDIT AND AND READY TO WORK WITH THEM AND BEFORE I SIGN OFF I WOULD LIKE TO ACKNOWLEDGE SENATOR BILL DODD. AND ASSEMBLY WOMAN CURRY FOR YOUR REPRESENTATION IN YOUR AREAS AND I KNOW THAT -- YOU'VE BEEN THERE SEVERAL TIMES AND I CAN APPRECIATE. WHAT YOU'RE SAYING AND AS A MAYOR OF A CITY THAT SOMETIMES WE HAVE AN ENTITY THAT COMES TO OUR CITY? AND WE TRY TO BE BUSINESS FRIENDLY AND AND I THINK OF WILL. REALIZE THAT ALL OF US WHO SERVED OUR GREAT COUNTRY -- LOOK TO YOU AND ALL OF YOU TO TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO SERVED IF WE CAN COME TOGETHER TO FIND THAT -- HAPPY MEDIUM BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY THERE'S ISSUES TO ADDRESS BUT THESE ARE BUSINESS ISSUES YOU KNOW THE LEASES AND SO ON AND I THINK WE CAN WORK THAT OUT OVER TIME. I'D LIKE YOU TO CONSIDER MISTER SECRETARY ESTABLISH THAT. THE OTHER THING IS -- TO LOOK AT THE INTERNAL AUDITS -- AS A MEDICAL DOCTOR OF WHAT'S GOING ON UP AND DOWN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IN ADVISE SOME OF THE OTHER. ADMINISTRATORS TO DO SOME INTERNAL AUDITING SHOW -- WE'RE NOT LOOKING AT ISSUES PERTAINING TO THE CARE AND MAINTENANCE OF OUR VETERANS AND THESE THINGS ARE. ARE TANGIBLE WHO CAN WORK ON IT WOULD TAKE CARE OF THEM -- BUT WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE CARE THE VETERANS WE WANT TO BE SURE WERE PROACTIVE. SO I THANK YOU FOR COMING BEFORE US AND I APPRECIATE YOUR SERVICE. TO OUR MEN AND WOMEN IN UNIFORM AND I CERTAINLY WOULD LIKE -- TO GET OUT TO YOU KNOW IT'S FILLED IN WHEN YOU GET OUT -- CAN FOR TO THAT TOO THANK YOU GET. RIGHT.
