00:39:27.565 --> 00:39:28.933
ADDICTIONS AND MANY TIMES I'VE

00:39:28.999 --> 00:39:30.634
BEEN IN AND OUT OF THE SYSTEM

00:39:30.701 --> 00:39:32.036

OPPORTUNITY TO RECOVER -- WOULD

00:40:07.037 --> 00:40:09.173

00:40:21.085 --> 00:40:22.820
WITH VERY LITTLE OPPORTUNITY

00:40:22.887 --> 00:40:25.890
WHETHER EVEN BE TO DRIVE.

00:40:25.956 --> 00:40:27.892
FOR RESOURCES IT PUTS THEM BACK

00:40:27.958 --> 00:40:29.627

00:40:33.831 --> 00:40:35.099

00:48:09.253 --> 00:48:14.258
THIS IS A HUGE UMBRELLA TO SAY.

00:48:14.324 --> 00:48:17.094
AS FAR AS FUNDING HOUSING ACROSS

00:48:17.160 --> 00:48:19.062
THE STATE HOW ARE WE GOING TO DO

00:48:19.129 --> 00:48:21.098
THIS WE KNOW THERE'S A SHORTAGE

00:48:21.164 --> 00:48:22.366
WE KNOW THAT THERE IS AN ARRAY

00:48:22.432 --> 00:48:24.935
OF NOT ONLY LEGISLATION.

00:48:25.002 --> 00:48:27.004
PROPOSALS BILLS AND ALSO

00:48:27.070 --> 00:48:28.739
RESOURCES BUT HOW DO WE MAKE

00:48:28.805 --> 00:48:29.873
SURE.

00:48:29.940 --> 00:48:31.608
THAT THIS GETS TO WHERE IT NEEDS

00:48:31.675 --> 00:48:33.143
THE FUNDS GET TO WHERE THEY NEED

00:48:33.210 --> 00:48:34.811
TO BE AND THAT WE HAVE

00:48:34.878 --> 00:48:37.214
COLLABORATION -- THIS BILL WILL

00:48:37.281 --> 00:48:39.383
CREATE A HOLISTIC APPROACH TO

00:48:39.449 --> 00:48:40.384
GET PEOPLE OFF THE STREETS

00:48:40.450 --> 00:48:43.153
QUICKLY WITH RENTAL ASSISTANCE

00:48:43.220 --> 00:48:45.122
AND WHEN I NOTE THAT SOME SOME

00:48:45.188 --> 00:48:46.957
HAVE SAID TO ME ABOUT WHAT WHY

00:48:47.024 --> 00:48:47.758
WOULD YOU WANT TO PAY FOR

00:48:47.824 --> 00:48:49.059
SOMEBODY'S OF RENT THAT'S A

00:48:49.126 --> 00:48:50.394
TEMPORARY FIX.

00:48:50.460 --> 00:48:52.429
WHAT WE KNOW FOR SURE IS WHEN WE

00:48:52.496 --> 00:48:56.566
CAN KEEP PEOPLE IN THERE?

00:48:56.633 --> 00:48:58.669
THEIR HOMES THAT BEING RENTED

00:48:58.735 --> 00:49:01.204
THAT WE SOLVE AN ISSUE BECAUSE

00:49:01.271 --> 00:49:03.040
ONCE SOMEBODY'S EVICTED IT BUT

00:49:03.106 --> 00:49:05.108
IT COULD COST UP TO TEN THOUSAND

00:49:05.175 --> 00:49:07.010
DOLLARS TO PUT THEM BACK INTO A

00:49:07.077 --> 00:49:08.545
ROOM AND OTHER RENTAL AND MANY

00:49:08.612 --> 00:49:10.814
TIMES IT'S NOT AN EASY PROCESS.

00:49:10.881 --> 00:49:11.915
BECAUSE THEY HAVE AN INFECTION

00:49:11.982 --> 00:49:14.084
ON THE RECORD -- IT WOULD

00:49:14.151 --> 00:49:16.320
PROVIDE FOR RENTAL ASSISTANCE

00:49:16.386 --> 00:49:17.354

WE CAN ALL AGREE THAT OUR

00:51:21.511 --> 00:51:22.846
STATE'S GOAL SHOULD BE TO END

00:51:22.913 --> 00:51:24.080

WITH THIS NEW FLEXIBLE PROGRAM

00:51:31.855 --> 00:51:33.089
THE STATE COULD ACHIEVE THIS

00:51:33.156 --> 00:51:34.357
GOAL BY COMBINING SERVICES AND

00:51:34.424 --> 00:51:36.860
PROGRAMS PROVEN TO DECREASE

00:51:36.927 --> 00:51:38.628

THE POOL IS MEANT TO BE FLEXIBLE

00:52:12.596 --> 00:52:14.364
IN FACT OUR LEGISLATION LAYS OUT

SAID -- WITH PUBLIC ADVOCATES I

02:26:19.937 --> 02:26:21.405
AM VERY EXCITED TO BE ON THE

02:26:21.472 --> 02:26:23.107
SIDE OF THE TABLE WITH THE

02:26:23.174 --> 02:26:26.177
APARTMENT ASSOCIATION REALLY.

ORGANIZATION -- FOCUSES ITS WORK

02:26:30.548 --> 02:26:31.816
IN A IN IN PART IN HOUSING

02:26:31.883 --> 02:26:33.851
JUSTICE THAT'S A MAJOR COMPONENT

02:26:33.918 --> 02:26:35.920
WHAT WE DO. TO ADVANCE THE

02:26:35.987 --> 02:26:36.754
RIGHTS OF FAMILIES TO LIVE IN

02:26:36.821 --> 02:26:38.422
COMMUNITIES WITH GOOD JOBS AND

02:26:38.489 --> 02:26:39.891
GOOD SCHOOLS AND GOOD SERVICE AS

02:26:39.957 --> 02:26:42.493
REGARDLESS OF THEIR ETHNICITY OR

02:26:42.560 --> 02:26:44.562
INCOME -- I DON'T THINK ANY TO

02:26:44.629 --> 02:26:45.663
EXPLAIN THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING

02:26:45.730 --> 02:26:47.598
CRISIS ANYONE ON THIS COMMITTEE --

02:26:47.665 --> 02:26:49.534
WE DIDN'T GET INTO THIS CRISIS

02:26:49.600 --> 02:26:51.068
ONE WAY IT WAS A LOT OF

02:26:51.135 --> 02:26:52.670
DECISIONS AND MARKET MECHANISMS

02:26:52.737 --> 02:26:53.838
THAT GOT US HERE AND IT'S NOT

02:26:53.905 --> 02:26:55.106
GOING TO BE ONE WAY THAT WE GET

02:26:55.173 --> 02:26:56.607
OUT WE NEED A LOT OF TOOLS.

02:26:56.674 --> 02:26:57.875
AND A LOT OF POLICIES TO FIX

02:26:57.942 --> 02:27:00.311
THIS AND I THINK AB FIFTEEN

02:27:00.378 --> 02:27:00.945
SIXTY EIGHT CAN BE ONE OF THOSE

02:27:01.012 --> 02:27:03.915
TOOLS -- SIMPLY PUT FIFTEEN

02:27:03.981 --> 02:27:04.549
SIXTY EIGHT RECONDITION CERTAIN

02:27:04.615 --> 02:27:05.516
STATE GRANT FUNDS TO

02:27:05.583 --> 02:27:07.451
JURISDICTIONS CONTINGENT ON

02:27:07.518 --> 02:27:07.985
HAVING A COMPLAINT HOUSING

02:27:08.052 --> 02:27:09.954
ELEMENT -- CONDITIONING FUNDS

02:27:10.021 --> 02:27:11.422
THAT -- RECALCITRANT

02:27:11.489 --> 02:27:13.558
JURISDICTIONS WANT WILL HELP

02:27:13.624 --> 02:27:14.926
BRING THEM INTO COMPLIANCE.

02:27:14.992 --> 02:27:15.693
PUBLIC ADVOCATES HELPED CREATE

02:27:15.760 --> 02:27:17.762
THE WHEN BAY AREA GRANT PROGRAM

IN DC AREA MEMBERS MAY BE

02:27:19.997 --> 02:27:20.798
FAMILIAR WITH THAT.

02:27:20.865 --> 02:27:23.434
BUT LIKE AB FIFTEEN SIXTY EIGHT

02:27:23.501 --> 02:27:24.035
THIS PROGRAM CONDITION CERTAIN

02:27:24.101 --> 02:27:25.403
FUNDS BASED ON LOCAL JUST

02:27:25.469 --> 02:27:27.305
JURISDICTIONS ADVANCING THE BAY

02:27:27.371 --> 02:27:28.139
AREA'S LAND USE AND HOUSING

02:27:28.206 --> 02:27:28.973
GOALS.

02:27:29.040 --> 02:27:30.274
AND JURISDICTIONS MUST MEET

02:27:30.341 --> 02:27:31.809
CERTAIN REQUIREMENTS INCLUDING

HAVING A COMPLIANT HOUSING

02:27:33.244 --> 02:27:35.780
ELEMENT TO QUALIFY.

BEFORE -- BAG.

02:27:37.148 --> 02:27:37.748
OVER TWENTY JURISDICTIONS IN THE

02:27:37.815 --> 02:27:38.382
BAY AREA DIDN'T HAVE COMPLAINED

02:27:38.449 --> 02:27:40.318
HOUSING ELEMENTS AND NOW NEARLY

02:27:40.384 --> 02:27:41.786
ALL OF THEM DO.

02:27:41.852 --> 02:27:43.120
THE LEGISLATURE HAS CREATED MANY

02:27:43.187 --> 02:27:44.121
CARROTS TO ENCOURAGE

02:27:44.188 --> 02:27:45.356
JURISDICTIONS TO DO THE RIGHT

02:27:45.423 --> 02:27:46.657
THING ON HOUSING BUT SO FAR

02:27:46.724 --> 02:27:48.359
CARROTS HAVE NOT BEEN ENOUGH TO

02:27:48.426 --> 02:27:49.994
GET SOME JURISDICTIONS TO ACT.

02:27:50.061 --> 02:27:51.896
AB FIFTEEN SIXTY EIGHT WOULD NOT

02:27:51.963 --> 02:27:53.564
TAKE EFFECT UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY

02:27:53.631 --> 02:27:53.998

JURISDICTIONS PLENTY OF TIME TO

02:27:55.600 --> 02:27:56.601
DO THE RIGHT THING.

02:27:56.667 --> 02:27:58.769

[inaudible]

02:28:07.778 --> 02:28:10.381
CHAIRMAN CHIU.

02:28:10.448 --> 02:28:12.416
KEVIN -- I CONSIDER THE SMART

02:28:12.483 --> 02:28:15.219
LEGISLATION WATCHING OVER THE

02:28:15.286 --> 02:28:16.554
VARIOUS YEARS.

02:28:16.621 --> 02:28:19.857
YES WE HAVE SOME FUN OUTSIDE --

02:28:19.924 --> 02:28:22.960
ANYWAY -- BUT ANYWAY -- DEALING

02:28:23.027 --> 02:28:24.395
WITH THIS I THINK IT'S GOOD

02:28:24.462 --> 02:28:28.065
LEGISLATION BECAUSE INDEED THE

02:28:28.132 --> 02:28:29.867
SHOULD WE SAY STICK IS OUT THERE

02:28:29.934 --> 02:28:33.404
TO WHAT AND THE REASONS WHY --

02:28:33.471 --> 02:28:35.039
IN THE PAST YOU'VE NOT SEEN THIS

02:28:35.106 --> 02:28:36.741
AND I BELIEVE I KNOW I'M NOT

02:28:36.807 --> 02:28:38.409
VERY OFTEN AGREEMENT WITH THE

02:28:38.476 --> 02:28:41.379
TRADE IN THE ASSOCIATION -- I

02:28:41.445 --> 02:28:45.216
BELIEVE IT'S A GOOD EFFORT TO

02:28:45.283 --> 02:28:46.917
DEAL WITH THE UNDER -- THOUSAND

02:28:46.984 --> 02:28:50.788
SHOULD WE SEE DOLLAR RENTING

02:28:50.855 --> 02:28:50.988
ISSUE.

02:28:51.055 --> 02:28:55.059
AND HOLDS THE STE.

02:28:55.126 --> 02:28:56.994
MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC IN SUPPORT.

02:28:57.061 --> 02:28:57.895
MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC IN

02:28:57.962 --> 02:29:04.101
OPPOSITION TO THE BILL.

02:29:04.168 --> 02:29:05.336
GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN MEMBERS

02:29:05.403 --> 02:29:06.537
CHRIS LEE ON BEHALF OF THE

02:29:06.604 --> 02:29:08.039
CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF

02:29:08.105 --> 02:29:09.940
COUNTIES -- RESPECTFULLY IN

02:29:10.007 --> 02:29:11.742
OPPOSITION THE BILL HAS TAKEN

02:29:11.809 --> 02:29:13.044
SORT OF AN INTERESTING PATH WE

02:29:13.110 --> 02:29:15.146
WENT FROM A VERY NARROWLY

02:29:15.212 --> 02:29:18.582
DEFINED STICK AS REGIONAL SAY.

02:29:18.649 --> 02:29:20.484
AND I'M A BIG TRIGGER THAT WOULD

02:29:20.551 --> 02:29:21.886
LIKELY WOULD HAVE CAUGHT UP

02:29:21.952 --> 02:29:24.455
NEARLY ALL JURISDICTIONS WE NOW

02:29:24.522 --> 02:29:25.056
SORT OF FLIP THAT AND WE HAVE

02:29:25.122 --> 02:29:28.125
EVEN INCREDIBLY BROAD STACK

02:29:28.192 --> 02:29:29.794
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ALL

02:29:29.860 --> 02:29:31.295
POTENTIAL STATE GRANT FUNDS.

02:29:31.362 --> 02:29:33.397
WITH A VERY NARROW EXCEPTION FOR

02:29:33.464 --> 02:29:34.832
CERTAIN TRANSPORTATION RELATED

02:29:34.899 --> 02:29:36.734
GRANTS AND CERTAIN HOUSING

02:29:36.801 --> 02:29:38.936
ELEMENT RELATED GRANTS AND SO

02:29:39.003 --> 02:29:41.238
THE ANTI HAS REALLY BEEN UP TO

02:29:41.305 --> 02:29:42.707
IN TERMS OF IF YOU LOOK AT THE

02:29:42.773 --> 02:29:44.909
SERVICES THAT COUNTIES PROVIDE.

02:29:44.975 --> 02:29:46.010
FOR MENTAL HEALTH AND HUMAN

02:29:46.077 --> 02:29:48.913
SERVICES BEHAVIORAL HEALTH WATER

02:29:48.979 --> 02:29:51.148
SEWER INFRASTRUCTURE CAP AND

02:29:51.215 --> 02:29:53.984
TRADE AGRICULTURAL SERVICES WE

02:29:54.051 --> 02:29:54.885
NOW HAVE A BILL THAT'S

02:29:54.952 --> 02:29:57.021
INCREDIBLY BROAD IN TERMS OF THE

02:29:57.088 --> 02:29:58.989
POTENTIAL FUNDING THAT COULD BE

02:29:59.056 --> 02:29:59.890
WITHHELD FROM LOCAL

02:29:59.957 --> 02:30:01.192
JURISDICTIONS.

02:30:01.258 --> 02:30:02.293
AND SO THAT'S OBVIOUSLY A

02:30:02.360 --> 02:30:04.729
SIGNIFICANT CONCERN FOR COUNTIES

02:30:04.795 --> 02:30:06.263
ON THE OTHER HAND WE'VE MOVED

02:30:06.330 --> 02:30:07.998
FROM A STANDARD THAT WE DIDN'T%

02:30:08.065 --> 02:30:10.301
THINK VERY MANY JURISDICTIONS

02:30:10.368 --> 02:30:11.769
WOULD BE ABLE TO FEASIBLY MEET

02:30:11.836 --> 02:30:13.471
GIVEN OUR EXISTING FUNDING

02:30:13.537 --> 02:30:15.673
SHORTAGE. FOR BELOW MODERATE

02:30:15.740 --> 02:30:18.175
INCOME HOUSING -- AFFORDABLE TO

02:30:18.242 --> 02:30:19.210
LOWER INCOME HOUSEHOLDS IN

02:30:19.276 --> 02:30:21.278
CALIFORNIA AND NOW WE'RE TALKING

02:30:21.345 --> 02:30:25.015
ABOUT THE STANDARDS FROM AB --

02:30:25.082 --> 02:30:25.850
SEVENTY TWO SEES ACTED NOT

02:30:25.916 --> 02:30:28.052
OBJECT TO AB SEVENTY TWO WE DID

02:30:28.119 --> 02:30:29.387
REQUEST SOME AMENDMENTS TO

02:30:29.453 --> 02:30:31.389
INCREASE THE DUE PROCESS

02:30:31.455 --> 02:30:34.658
PROVISIONS INHERENT IN AB --

02:30:34.725 --> 02:30:35.826
SEVENTY TWO AND I THINK THAT'S

02:30:35.893 --> 02:30:36.627
SOMETHING THAT'S A SPECIALLY

02:30:36.694 --> 02:30:38.629
NEEDED IN THIS BILL NOW BECAUSE

02:30:38.696 --> 02:30:40.331
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT RATHER THAN

02:30:40.398 --> 02:30:41.665
HAVING A PROCESS WHERE EACH CD

02:30:41.732 --> 02:30:43.033
IS GOING TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL

02:30:43.100 --> 02:30:43.934
ASSISTANCE.

02:30:44.001 --> 02:30:44.969
AND POTENTIALLY REFERRED

02:30:45.035 --> 02:30:46.704
JURISDICTIONS TO THE ATTORNEY

02:30:46.771 --> 02:30:48.572
GENERAL -- WE'RE NOT LEAVING UP

02:30:48.639 --> 02:30:49.907
TO THAT SAME ADMINISTRATIVE

02:30:49.974 --> 02:30:53.244
PROCESS A REALLY MUCH STRONGER

02:30:53.310 --> 02:30:55.279
REMEDY WHICH IS WITHHOLDING THE

02:30:55.346 --> 02:30:57.848
ABILITY TO APPLY FOR ALL STATE

02:30:57.915 --> 02:30:59.950
GRANTS I'M WE DO HAVE A SPECIFIC

02:31:00.017 --> 02:31:03.587
CONCERN WITH THE FACT THAT THE

02:31:03.654 --> 02:31:04.088
BILL DOES NOT INCLUDE A

02:31:04.155 --> 02:31:06.090
DEFINITION OF THE STATE GRANT.

02:31:06.157 --> 02:31:07.358
AS YOU KNOW COUNTIES PROVIDE A

02:31:07.425 --> 02:31:09.160
HUGE NUMBER OF THE STATE LEVEL

02:31:09.226 --> 02:31:11.162
SERVICES ESPECIALLY IN THE

02:31:11.228 --> 02:31:12.863
HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES STATE.

02:31:12.930 --> 02:31:14.665
I'M A SPACE SO WE ESPECIALLY

02:31:14.732 --> 02:31:16.634
NEED TO CLARIFY THAT THE BILL

02:31:16.700 --> 02:31:18.202
DOESN'T APPLY TO ANYTHING IN

02:31:18.269 --> 02:31:19.503
REALIGNMENT THERE'S SOME

02:31:19.570 --> 02:31:20.371
LANGUAGE IN THERE ABOUT

02:31:20.438 --> 02:31:22.006
CONSTITUTIONALLY PROTECTED

02:31:22.072 --> 02:31:24.175
REVENUES -- SOME REVENUES IN

02:31:24.241 --> 02:31:25.476
REALIGNMENT ARE CONSTITUTIONALLY

02:31:25.543 --> 02:31:27.912
PROTECTED OTHERS ARE NOT AND SO

02:31:27.978 --> 02:31:29.246
IF WE'RE GOING TO PUT YOU KNOW

02:31:29.313 --> 02:31:31.182
OUR IMPLEMENTATION OF HEALTH AND

02:31:31.248 --> 02:31:32.583
HUMAN SERVICES PROGRAMS.

02:31:32.650 --> 02:31:35.085
AT RISK -- THAT IS A HUGE

02:31:35.152 --> 02:31:37.121
CONCERN FOR US -- FINALLY ON THE

02:31:37.188 --> 02:31:38.789
DUE PROCESS PIECE I I REALLY

02:31:38.856 --> 02:31:40.224
THINK THAT SOMETHING THAT NEEDS

02:31:40.291 --> 02:31:42.359
TO BE LOOKED AT IN THIS BILL

02:31:42.426 --> 02:31:45.062
BECAUSE TWO OF THE ELEMENTS.

02:31:45.129 --> 02:31:46.964
IN THAT SUBDIVISION J. THE

02:31:47.031 --> 02:31:48.499
HOUSING ACCOUNTABILITY ACT IN

02:31:48.566 --> 02:31:50.634
THE DENSITY BONUS LAW REALLY ARE

02:31:50.701 --> 02:31:52.803
MOVING TARGETS ALL RIGHT --

02:31:52.870 --> 02:31:54.505
THERE'S PROPOSALS TO AMEND IN

02:31:54.572 --> 02:31:56.140
CITY BONUS NEARLY EVERY YEAR

02:31:56.207 --> 02:31:57.741
THERE'S BILLS THAT NEARLY WENT

02:31:57.808 --> 02:31:59.143
INTO EFFECT LAST YEAR THERE'S

02:31:59.210 --> 02:32:00.544
MORE UNDER CONSIDERATION THIS

02:32:00.611 --> 02:32:01.345
YEAR.

02:32:01.412 --> 02:32:03.347
AND SO THE RISK OF ACCIDENTAL

02:32:03.414 --> 02:32:06.183
NON COMPLIANCE -- INCREASES WITH

02:32:06.250 --> 02:32:07.852
EACH LEGISLATIVE CHANGE THERE

02:32:07.918 --> 02:32:11.489
AND SO FOR THOSE REASONS I SEE

02:32:11.555 --> 02:32:13.491
SECONDS RESPECTFULLY OPPOSED.

02:32:13.557 --> 02:32:14.191
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN

02:32:14.258 --> 02:32:14.859
ROBINSON WAS SHOT YOUR AND WE ON

02:32:14.925 --> 02:32:16.327
BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA TRANSIT

02:32:16.393 --> 02:32:19.663
ASSOCIATION -- WE WERE OPPOSED

02:32:19.730 --> 02:32:21.065
TO THE INITIAL VERSION OF THIS

02:32:21.131 --> 02:32:23.167
BILL WHICH ATTEMPTED -- TO THIS

02:32:23.234 --> 02:32:24.535
HOLD THE FLOW TRANSPORTATION

02:32:24.602 --> 02:32:25.870
FUNDING TO JURISDICTIONS THAT

02:32:25.936 --> 02:32:27.471
WERE FOUND TO BE IN COMPLIANCE --

02:32:27.538 --> 02:32:29.206
WE STILL REMAIN CONCERNED WITH

02:32:29.273 --> 02:32:31.542
THE BILL I DO SOME OF THE ISSUES

02:32:31.609 --> 02:32:32.042
THAT WERE RAISED IN THE

02:32:32.109 --> 02:32:35.346
COMMITTEE ANALYSIS SUCH AS THE

02:32:35.412 --> 02:32:36.380
PROHIBITION ON THE ACCESS TO CAP

02:32:36.447 --> 02:32:39.517
AND TRADE GRANTS ARE AGENCIES --

02:32:39.583 --> 02:32:41.385
ARE ARE WELL FUNDED FROM A

02:32:41.452 --> 02:32:42.286
PROGRAM KNOWN AS THE TRANSIT

02:32:42.353 --> 02:32:43.921
INTERCITY REAL CAPITAL PROGRAM

02:32:43.988 --> 02:32:45.489

COMMUNITIES THAT ARE STRUGGLING --

02:36:57.908 --> 02:36:59.877
IN A POSITION WHERE SOME OF THE

02:36:59.943 --> 02:37:02.579
OTHER FUNDS WOULD HELP THEM.

02:37:02.646 --> 02:37:04.548
MOVE FORWARD IN A WAY THAT THE

ISSUES AND OTHER -- AREAS THAT

02:37:21.932 --> 02:37:22.933
THE CITY NEEDS TO BE HEALTHY
