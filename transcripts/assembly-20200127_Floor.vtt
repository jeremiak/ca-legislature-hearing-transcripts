UNDER CERTAIN LIMITED

01:51:32.752 --> 01:51:34.654

01:51:49.069 --> 01:51:50.537
THEM IN SUPPORT THAT MEASURE A

01:51:50.603 --> 01:51:51.771
FEW YEARS AGO BUT WE'VE SEEN

01:51:51.838 --> 01:51:52.739
THAT IT HAS A SIGNIFICANT

01:51:52.806 --> 01:51:54.607
LOOPHOLE THAT WE NEED TO

01:51:54.674 --> 01:51:56.276
ADDRESS AND THAT IS THIS IF AN

01:51:56.342 --> 01:51:58.378
OFFICER IS UNDER ACTIVE

01:51:58.445 --> 01:51:59.879
INVESTIGATION WHETHER INTERNAL

AND IF THEY RESIGN. THE PUBLIC

01:52:11.424 --> 01:52:12.892
NEVER HAS THE ABILITY TO GET

01:52:18.631 --> 01:52:19.833
THINKING THIS IS PROBABLY

01:52:19.899 --> 01:52:21.134
FAIRLY RARE AND YOU'RE RIGHT

01:52:21.201 --> 01:52:23.236
BUT WE'VE ALREADY SEEN IT

01:52:23.303 --> 01:52:25.038
HAPPEN ONCE IN A HAPPENED IN MY

01:52:25.105 --> 01:52:26.706

01:52:37.350 --> 01:52:40.553
NEVER CAME TO LIGHT. THAT'S THE

01:52:40.620 --> 01:52:43.156
PROBLEM IT'S HAPPENED BEFORE

01:52:43.223 --> 01:52:45.024
AND WILL HAPPEN AGAIN LESS WE

01:52:45.091 --> 01:52:47.093
DO SOMETHING AND THE POINT OF

01:52:47.160 --> 01:52:49.629
THIS IS NOT TO GO AFTER PEOPLE

01:52:49.696 --> 01:52:50.196
THAT WERE FALSELY ACCUSED OF

01:52:50.263 --> 01:52:53.933

01:52:55.401 --> 01:52:56.903
THAT THEY COMMITTED SOMETHING

01:52:56.970 --> 01:52:58.505
THAT SHOULD DISQUALIFY YOU

CERTAINLY IN THAT CATEGORY AND

01:53:06.079 --> 01:53:07.213
WE'VE ALREADY SAID THAT AS A

01:53:07.280 --> 01:53:10.116
STATE WHEN WE PASSED SB

01:53:10.183 --> 01:53:10.717

02:01:52.038 --> 02:01:53.005
MORE LIKELY TO ACCEPT MEDICARE

02:10:25.450 --> 02:10:27.119
BUT WE NEED CARE PROVIDERS OF

02:10:27.186 --> 02:10:28.787
WE DON'T HAVE CARE PROVIDERS.

02:10:28.854 --> 02:10:30.856
THEN EXPANDING ACCESS DOESN'T

02:10:30.923 --> 02:10:32.324
REALLY MEAN NYTHING THEY'RE

02:10:32.391 --> 02:10:34.526

NURSE PRACTITIONERS WILL TAKE

02:10:55.781 --> 02:10:56.748
THE PLACE OF POSITIONS WE WOULD

02:10:56.815 --> 02:10:58.817

02:11:11.863 --> 02:11:13.432
LETTER TO THE PROPERTY AND VERY

02:11:13.498 --> 02:11:15.200
LOW NUMBERS OF PROVIDERS.

02:11:15.267 --> 02:11:17.169
THAT'S A SYSTEM A RECIPE FOR

02:11:17.236 --> 02:11:18.537
DISASTER AS WE SEE HIV

02:11:18.604 --> 02:11:20.973

FOR YEARS I THINK TO SAY IT'S

02:11:32.484 --> 02:11:34.586
GOING TO FAST IS A LITTLE

02:11:34.653 --> 02:11:35.954
DISINGENUOUS AND THIS IS JUST

02:11:36.021 --> 02:11:37.122
