00:09:10.850 --> 00:09:12.084
WATER. TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL

00:09:12.151 --> 00:09:14.287
AND SUBSTANTIAL ENVIRONMENTAL

00:09:14.353 --> 00:09:15.588
CONCESSIONS AND THE BENEFITS

00:09:15.655 --> 00:09:17.456
INCLUDING REQUIRING THE PROJECT

00:09:17.523 --> 00:09:20.426
TO DELIVER NET ZERO GREENHOUSE

00:09:20.493 --> 00:09:22.061
GAS EMISSIONS. AS I MENTIONED

00:09:22.128 --> 00:09:23.095
THIS IS A DIFFERENT ISSUE WITH

00:09:23.162 --> 00:09:24.830
REGIONAL IMPACTS THIS DAM WAS

00:09:24.897 --> 00:09:26.732
BUILT IN NINETEEN FIFTY AND

00:09:26.799 --> 00:09:28.434
WHEN IT WAS BUILT IT WAS BUILT

00:09:28.501 --> 00:09:29.435
TO THE SAFETY STANDARDS OF THAT

00:09:29.502 --> 00:09:31.504
TIME- BUT AS WE KNOW THE DAM

00:09:31.570 --> 00:09:33.205
WAS CONSTRUCTED ALONG TO

00:09:33.272 --> 00:09:33.739
EARTHQUAKE FAULT LINES THE

00:09:33.806 --> 00:09:35.741
CALAVERAS. A FAULT WHICH IS A

00:09:35.808 --> 00:09:37.343
MAJOR BRANCH OF THE SAN ANDREAS

00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:39.478
FAULT SYSTEM. AND THE DAM ALSO

00:09:39.545 --> 00:09:40.746
SITS DIRECTLY ABOVE THE CAIRO

00:09:40.813 --> 00:09:42.715
CREEK FAULTLINE- AND TODAY THE

00:09:42.782 --> 00:09:44.383
STATE HAS SOME SERIOUS

00:09:44.450 --> 00:09:46.652
STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY ISSUES- IN

00:09:46.719 --> 00:09:47.853
THE EVENT OF AN EARTHQUAKE A

00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:49.822
BREACH OF THE DAM AT FULL

00:09:49.889 --> 00:09:50.890
CAPACITY WOULD BE CATASTROPHIC.

00:09:50.957 --> 00:09:52.758
IT SHOULD BE MENTIONED THAT

00:09:52.825 --> 00:09:53.326
WHILE VALLEY WATER CAN DRAIN

00:09:53.392 --> 00:09:56.295
THE DAM- COMMITTEE V. EIGHT A

00:09:56.362 --> 00:09:57.930
MAJOR RAIN EVENT THE WATERSHED

00:09:57.997 --> 00:09:59.932
CAN REFILL THE MUCH FASTER THAN

00:09:59.999 --> 00:10:01.867
IT CAN BE DRAINED. AND SO IF A

00:10:01.934 --> 00:10:03.336
BREACH OF THE WERE TO OCCUR

00:10:03.402 --> 00:10:04.570
IT'S PREDICTED THAT FROM THE

00:10:04.637 --> 00:10:05.938
SIDE OF THE DAM FLOODING WOULD

00:10:06.005 --> 00:10:07.540
EXTEND MORE THAN FORTY MILES.

00:10:07.606 --> 00:10:08.441
FLOODING OVER A HALF DOZEN

00:10:08.507 --> 00:10:10.176
CITIES AND TOWNS AND SUBMERGING

00:10:10.242 --> 00:10:12.044
MUCH OF THE SILICON VALLEY.

00:10:12.111 --> 00:10:13.813
MOST LIKELY THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE

00:10:13.879 --> 00:10:15.581
AT A MINIMUM WOULD NOT BE ABLE

00:10:15.648 --> 00:10:17.516
TO EVACUATE. RESULTING IN A

00:10:17.583 --> 00:10:19.185
SIGNIFICANT LOSS OF PROPERTY

00:10:19.251 --> 00:10:20.753
AND POTENTIALLY LIFE. AND SO

00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:22.521
THIS BILL IS AN URGENCY BILL

00:10:22.588 --> 00:10:24.156
CONTAINS AN URGENCY CLAUSE.

00:10:24.223 --> 00:10:25.191
BECAUSE ON FEBRUARY TWENTIETH

00:10:25.257 --> 00:10:26.625
THE FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY

00:10:26.692 --> 00:10:28.761

THIS YEAR. THAT'S ACCORDING TO

00:10:37.536 --> 00:10:38.904
THE FEDERAL ORDER THIS.

RETROFIT IS FOR EX NUMBER ONE

00:10:40.806 --> 00:10:42.541
HIGHEST DAM SAFETY PRIORITY

00:10:42.608 --> 00:10:44.310
PROJECT IN THE NATION. A

00:10:44.377 --> 00:10:45.111
BECAUSE BASED ON NEW

00:10:45.177 --> 00:10:46.412
INFORMATION REGARDING THE DAM

00:10:46.479 --> 00:10:47.780
TO SEISMIC VULNERABILITIES THE

00:10:47.847 --> 00:10:49.648
DAM SAFETY RISK IS ON

00:10:49.715 --> 00:10:52.952
ACCEPTABLY HIGH. AND THIS

00:10:53.019 --> 00:10:55.121
FEDERAL DIRECTIVE- TO BEGIN

00:10:55.187 --> 00:10:56.222

IN THE COUNTY SANTA CLARA POSES

00:10:58.324 --> 00:11:00.559
MANY MANY CHALLENGES- THE

00:11:00.626 --> 00:11:01.594
DRAINAGE WILL SEVERELY REDUCE

00:11:01.660 --> 00:11:03.129
WATER RESERVES GROUNDWATER

00:11:03.195 --> 00:11:05.064
BASINS COULD BE IMPACTED IN THE

00:11:05.131 --> 00:11:06.032

00:11:06.098 --> 00:11:07.700
PRO TO DROUGHT THIS IS A HUGE

00:11:07.767 --> 00:11:10.870
HUGE PROBLEM. AND SO AGAIN THIS

00:11:10.936 --> 00:11:12.071

FACILITATE CONSTRUCTION

00:11:17.009 --> 00:11:17.576
IMPROVEMENTS AT THIS. IT WOULD

00:11:17.643 --> 00:11:19.311
ALSO CREATE OVER FIVE THOUSAND

DESPITE ITS OVERFLOW THAT. THAT

AND WE DO HAVE A MOTION ON THE

00:40:31.529 --> 00:40:35.199
BILL FROM VICE CHAIR JONES AND

00:40:35.266 --> 00:40:38.602
I RECOGNIZE SENATOR JACKSON. S.

THANK YOU AND I APPRECIATE THE

00:40:41.772 --> 00:40:44.708
URGENCY OF THIS- AND SO I'M I'M

00:40:44.775 --> 00:40:47.511
KIND OF TORN. BECAUSE PUBLIC

00:40:47.578 --> 00:40:49.046
SAFETY OF COURSE IS SO

00:40:49.113 --> 00:40:51.248
CRITICALLY IMPORTANT MY CONCERN

00:40:51.315 --> 00:40:53.984
AGAIN IS- AS WE REQUIRE THE

00:40:54.051 --> 00:40:57.221
COURTS ARE TO DO EXPEDITED

00:40:57.288 --> 00:40:58.989
REVIEW THERE ARE THERE ARE FEW

00:40:59.056 --> 00:41:00.858
PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT

00:41:00.925 --> 00:41:01.759
ONE IS I DON'T THINK WE REALLY

00:41:01.826 --> 00:41:04.995
CAN FORCE THEM TO DO A REVIEW

00:41:05.062 --> 00:41:05.963
IN TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY

00:41:06.030 --> 00:41:08.332
DAYS- IT'S KIND OF ASPIRATIONAL

00:41:08.399 --> 00:41:09.533
ONE OF THE REASONS IS BECAUSE

00:41:09.600 --> 00:41:10.634
WE DON'T REALLY HAVE CONTROL

00:41:10.701 --> 00:41:12.203
OVER THE COURTS AND THE

00:41:12.269 --> 00:41:15.472
PROCEDURAL- MANNER WITH WHICH

00:41:15.539 --> 00:41:19.543
THEY- OPERATE. THIS A ARE NOW

00:41:19.610 --> 00:41:21.011
WITH IN THE MIDST OF THIS

00:41:21.078 --> 00:41:24.281
PANDEMIC- WE ARE FIGHTING TO

00:41:24.348 --> 00:41:28.552
RETAIN THE ABEYANCE ON FICTIONS

00:41:28.619 --> 00:41:29.620
OUR CRIMINAL COURTS ARE

00:41:29.687 --> 00:41:32.857
BACKLOGGED BECAUSE OF THE-

00:41:32.923 --> 00:41:35.226
MONTHS WHERE WE HAVE ALSO

00:41:35.292 --> 00:41:38.796
WITHHELD THE PROCESS BY WHICH-

00:41:38.863 --> 00:41:41.232
OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE PROCEEDS

00:41:41.298 --> 00:41:43.334
AND OF COURSE THAT THE LAW THE

00:41:43.400 --> 00:41:45.636
CONSTITUTION ALLOWS FOR SPEEDY

00:41:45.703 --> 00:41:49.373
TRIALS- WE'VE SEEN A NUMBER OF

00:41:49.440 --> 00:41:52.509
DISTRICT ATTORNEYS WORKING WITH

00:41:52.576 --> 00:41:54.278
PUBLIC DEFENDERS TO KEEP. THE

00:41:54.345 --> 00:41:56.480
COURTS FUNCTIONING EVEN THOUGH

00:41:56.547 --> 00:41:58.215
THE REALLY NOT FUNCTIONING AND

00:41:58.282 --> 00:42:00.818
NOW WE'RE GOING TO DO THIS-

00:42:00.885 --> 00:42:03.554
EXPEDITED REVIEW. SO THE IN THE

00:42:03.621 --> 00:42:05.856
IN ITS CURRENT CONTEXT I'M

00:42:05.923 --> 00:42:08.125
CONCERNED IN THAT REGARD ALSO

00:42:08.192 --> 00:42:10.828
THE MORE EXPEDITED REVIEWS THAT

00:42:10.895 --> 00:42:12.296
WE DIRECT FOR THESE VARIOUS

00:42:12.363 --> 00:42:13.697
KINDS OF PROJECTS THE QUESTION

00:42:13.764 --> 00:42:15.833
THAT COMES TO ME IS. WHAT

00:42:15.900 --> 00:42:18.369
WHAT'S THE NEXT URGENCY THAT

00:42:18.435 --> 00:42:20.537
REQUIRES IMMEDIATE CARE BECAUSE

00:42:20.604 --> 00:42:22.473
OUR- INFRASTRUCTURE IS IN

00:42:22.539 --> 00:42:25.109
DISREPAIR AND- IT'S DANGEROUS

00:42:25.175 --> 00:42:28.012
AND SO MANY DIFFERENT AREAS SO

00:42:28.078 --> 00:42:30.981
I AM TORN BECAUSE I RECOGNIZE

00:42:31.048 --> 00:42:33.717
AND I DON'T WANT TO SEE- THIS

00:42:33.784 --> 00:42:37.187
LEVEL OF POTENTIAL DISASTER.

00:42:37.254 --> 00:42:39.290
WHICH APPARENTLY DOES EXIST ON

00:42:39.356 --> 00:42:40.925
THE OTHER HAND I'M A LITTLE

00:42:40.991 --> 00:42:43.560
WORRIED ABOUT. NGUYEN IS AN

00:42:43.627 --> 00:42:45.896
URGENT PROJECT ENERGY PROJECT I

TRUE REGARDING THE DOUBLING OF

THE PENALTY MINIMUM. WHICH WILL

01:13:44.753 --> 01:13:47.055

PER GALLON RANGE. THIS

01:14:09.378 --> 01:14:10.679

YES THANK YOU- ASSEMBLY MEMBER

01:18:52.861 --> 01:18:54.162
THIS PREVENTED CURRENT IN OUR

01:18:54.229 --> 01:18:56.465
DISTRICT. ON MY BIRTHDAY SO I

01:18:56.531 --> 01:19:00.235
REMEMBER QUITE WELL- AND AS WE

01:19:00.302 --> 01:19:01.770
DUG DEEPER INTO WHAT WAS THE

01:19:01.837 --> 01:19:05.173
CAUSE OF THIS- THE FACT IS THAT

01:19:05.240 --> 01:19:07.209
PLAINS ALL AMERICAN PIPELINE

01:19:07.275 --> 01:19:09.978
HAD A CHOICE TO PUT IN A CUT

01:19:10.045 --> 01:19:12.080
OFF VALVE WOULD HAVE COST ABOUT

01:19:12.147 --> 01:19:16.351
A MILLION DOLLARS- IN THAT YEAR

01:19:16.418 --> 01:19:18.053
THEY HAD MADE I THINK PROFITS

01:19:18.120 --> 01:19:19.321
OF ABOUT EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION

01:19:19.387 --> 01:19:21.022
DOLLARS. SO THEY MADE A

01:19:21.089 --> 01:19:25.160
BUSINESS DECISION TO USE AN OLD.

01:19:25.227 --> 01:19:26.728
INADEQUATE CUT OFF FAILED THAT

01:19:26.795 --> 01:19:28.663
WOULD HAVE IMMEDIATELY

01:19:28.730 --> 01:19:30.565
RECOGNIZE WHEN THE PRESSURE HAD

01:19:30.632 --> 01:19:31.766
GOTTEN TO THE POINT THAT IT

01:19:31.833 --> 01:19:34.970
HAD. AND WOULD HAVE CUT OFF OF

01:19:35.036 --> 01:19:38.306
THAT OIL. SO INSTEAD WHAT

01:19:38.373 --> 01:19:40.976
HAPPENED WAS IT WAS A WRITER ON

01:19:41.042 --> 01:19:42.477
MEMORIAL DAY WEEKEND UP NEAR

01:19:42.544 --> 01:19:44.379
SOME OF OUR BEAUTIFUL STATE

01:19:44.446 --> 01:19:47.482
BEACHES AND OTHER FACILITIES.

01:19:47.549 --> 01:19:49.885
SO PEOPLE FROM ALL OVER THE

01:19:49.951 --> 01:19:51.653
STATE THE CENTRAL VALLEY IN.

01:19:51.720 --> 01:19:53.188
THE SOUTHERN PART OF THE STATE

01:19:53.255 --> 01:19:55.690
WHO HAD PLANNED PROBABLY CLOSE

01:19:55.757 --> 01:19:56.825
TO A YEAR IN ADVANCE THAT'S

01:19:56.892 --> 01:19:58.426
WHEN RESERVATIONS HAD TO BE

01:19:58.493 --> 01:20:00.428
MADE AT THE STATE PARKS AND ALL

01:20:00.495 --> 01:20:02.430
TO COME UP TO SPEND THAT TIME

01:20:02.497 --> 01:20:04.933
WITH THEIR FAMILIES. THE PARKS

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:07.669
WERE CLOSED. SO THIS NOT ONLY

01:20:07.736 --> 01:20:10.405
IMPACTED PEOPLE COMING TO WRECK

01:20:10.472 --> 01:20:12.240
CREATE IN THE AREA BUT ALSO THE

01:20:12.307 --> 01:20:14.910
BUSINESSES SMALL BUSINESSES SO

01:20:14.976 --> 01:20:18.413
pKEEP EXPRESSING THEIR CONCERN

01:20:18.480 --> 01:20:20.382
FOR SMALL BUSINESSES. WHAT

01:20:20.448 --> 01:20:21.816
HAPPENED HERE WAS THAT SMALL

01:20:21.883 --> 01:20:23.985
BUSINESSES FOR A PERIOD OF

01:20:24.052 --> 01:20:25.620
SEVERAL WEEKS IF NOT MONTHS

01:20:25.687 --> 01:20:28.657
WE'RE NOT ABLE TO FUNCTION AND

01:20:28.723 --> 01:20:29.524
SO THEY WENT OUT OF BUSINESS.

01:20:29.591 --> 01:20:31.693
SO THIS ONE MILLION DOLLAR

01:20:31.760 --> 01:20:34.262
INVESTMENT ENDED UP COSTING

01:20:34.329 --> 01:20:35.397
MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF

01:20:35.463 --> 01:20:37.499
DOLLARS TO THE LOCAL COMMUNITY

01:20:37.566 --> 01:20:39.768
AND ALSO THE CLEANUP COSTS. AND

01:20:39.834 --> 01:20:42.037
THEN THERE WAS A PROSECUTION OR

01:20:42.103 --> 01:20:42.871
PROSECUTION OF CRIMINAL

01:20:42.938 --> 01:20:44.973
PROSECUTION IN WHICH THEY WERE

01:20:45.040 --> 01:20:46.208
FAR THE COMPANY WAS FOUND

01:20:46.274 --> 01:20:48.543
LIABLE NOW UNFORTUNATELY. YOU

01:20:48.610 --> 01:20:51.413
CAN'T PUT A CORPORATION IN JAIL.

01:20:51.479 --> 01:20:52.781
SO WHAT YOU CAN DO THOUGH IS

01:20:52.847 --> 01:20:55.217
THAT YOU CAN IMPOSE PENALTIES

01:20:55.283 --> 01:20:57.485
AND THE PURPOSE IS TO PREVENT

01:20:57.552 --> 01:20:58.954
THIS KIND OF BEHAVIOR FROM

01:20:59.020 --> 01:21:00.922
OCCURRING IN THE FUTURE. THE

01:21:00.989 --> 01:21:04.326
JUDGE VERY SPECIFICALLY GBOMO

01:21:04.392 --> 01:21:06.161
ON THE FACT THAT THE AMOUNT OF

01:21:06.228 --> 01:21:08.096
PENALTY HE WAS ABLE TO INFLICT

01:21:08.163 --> 01:21:11.933
WAS SO MINIMAL BECAUSE THE- THE

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:13.802
CURRENT STATE OF A MAXIMUM

01:21:13.868 --> 01:21:16.104
PENALTIES WAS SO LOW AND I

01:21:16.171 --> 01:21:18.240
SUSPECT THAT'S THE REASON THAT

01:21:18.306 --> 01:21:21.042
YOU BROUGHT THIS BILL. AND SO

01:21:21.109 --> 01:21:23.044
IF WE'RE LOOKING TO TRY TO

01:21:23.111 --> 01:21:24.646
DETER THEIR BEHAVIOR IN THE

01:21:24.713 --> 01:21:26.281
FUTURE WHICH COST A NUMBER OF

01:21:26.348 --> 01:21:28.416
OUR LOCAL SMALL BUSINESSES TO

01:21:28.483 --> 01:21:32.554
GO UNDER. AND POLLUTED ARE-

01:21:32.621 --> 01:21:34.923
OCEANS. POLLUTED TO OR AND

01:21:34.990 --> 01:21:36.591
RUINED THE ABILITY OF PEOPLE

01:21:36.658 --> 01:21:38.026
FROM ALL OVER THE STATE TO COME

01:21:38.093 --> 01:21:40.929
AND ENJOY THE BEAUTIFUL COAST

01:21:40.996 --> 01:21:41.463
THAT BELONGS TO US ALL IN

01:21:41.529 --> 01:21:44.099
CALIFORNIA. THE AT THE ATTEMPT

01:21:44.165 --> 01:21:46.167
HERE TO A DOUBLE THE FINES IS

01:21:46.234 --> 01:21:48.069
REALLY. FRANKLY KIND OF

01:21:48.136 --> 01:21:50.438
MINIMAL- THE FACT THAT THERE

01:21:50.505 --> 01:21:54.276
WOULD BE OPPOSITION- IS ALSO.

01:21:54.342 --> 01:21:55.443
NOT SURPRISING BUT

01:21:55.510 --> 01:21:56.911
DISAPPOINTING WE'RE NOT TALKING

01:21:56.978 --> 01:21:58.413
ABOUT PUTTING THEM OUT OF

01:21:58.480 --> 01:21:59.714
BUSINESS THE GOAL IS TO TRY TO

01:21:59.781 --> 01:22:01.483
DISCOURAGE THIS BEHAVIOR GOING

01:22:01.549 --> 01:22:03.551
FORWARD SO. I THINK THE I THINK

01:22:03.618 --> 01:22:04.986
IT'S HELPFUL TO PUT THAT IN

01:22:05.053 --> 01:22:07.389
THAT CONTEXT BECAUSE IT WAS THE

01:22:07.455 --> 01:22:10.492
JUDGE WHO AGAIN WAS UNABLE TO

01:22:10.558 --> 01:22:12.527
DO MORE EVEN AFTER A CRIMINAL

01:22:12.594 --> 01:22:14.896
CONVICTION. OF THIS COMPANY A

01:22:14.963 --> 01:22:17.899

03:16:43.224 --> 03:16:45.660
MOUNTAIN LION OR GARIBALDI- THE

03:16:45.727 --> 03:16:47.061
DO YOU KNOW THE GIANT WHITE SEA

03:16:47.128 --> 03:16:49.831

SPECIES. WE CAN DO BOTH HERE I

03:16:53.902 --> 03:16:56.337
THINK THIS BILL IS READY- I

03:16:56.404 --> 03:16:57.205
THINK THAT THE AMENDMENTS

03:16:57.272 --> 03:16:58.406
PROVIDE SOME IMPORTANT

03:16:58.473 --> 03:17:00.208
CLARIFICATION. AND I REALLY

03:17:00.275 --> 03:17:02.677
HOPE THAT I DIDN'T HEAR MUCH IN

03:17:02.744 --> 03:17:04.812
ENGAGEMENT- FROM THE OPPONENTS

03:17:04.879 --> 03:17:06.414
ABOUT THE MEANINGFUL AMENDMENTS

03:17:06.481 --> 03:17:08.183
MADE TO THE MEASURE OR HOW HOW

03:17:08.249 --> 03:17:10.418
FAR WE TRIED TO PUSH HERE. BUT

03:17:10.485 --> 03:17:12.453
I HOPE AT LEAST THOSE WHO HAVE

03:17:12.520 --> 03:17:14.255
BEEN MAY BE TOLD THAT THIS BILL

03:17:14.322 --> 03:17:15.957
WILL SHUT OFF YOUR ABILITY TO

03:17:16.024 --> 03:17:17.358
BE AN ANGLER HUNTER IN THE

03:17:17.425 --> 03:17:18.493

RECOGNIZE THE- THAT PEOPLE

03:17:22.864 --> 03:17:23.464
MAYBE WANT A LITTLE MORE

03:17:23.531 --> 03:17:25.066
GRANULARITY IN THE DEFINITION

03:17:25.133 --> 03:17:26.868
BUT I THINK THE FLEXIBILITY IS

03:17:26.935 --> 03:17:28.636
ACTUALLY CRITICAL TO ALLOWING

03:17:28.703 --> 03:17:30.638
SOME OF THESE OTHER USES BEING

03:17:30.705 --> 03:17:32.240
ENGAGED SO. I'M GONNA BE

03:17:32.307 --> 03:17:35.043

ALL BEEN GIVEN GUIDELINES BY

03:17:47.622 --> 03:17:49.857
WHICH WE MUST CONFORM AN ASSET

03:17:49.924 --> 03:17:50.792
TO REMOVE BILLS THAT WERE NOT

03:17:50.858 --> 03:17:52.894
RELATED TO COVERT AND EVEN I

03:17:52.961 --> 03:17:54.896
HAD BILLS THAT WERE REMOVED

03:17:54.963 --> 03:17:56.331
THAT WERE COVERED RELATED I

03:17:56.397 --> 03:17:58.132
WANNA SEE AUTHORED TERMS OF

03:17:58.199 --> 03:17:59.567
WHAT IS THIS BILLS CONNECTIONS

03:17:59.634 --> 03:18:01.736
CO THE CRISIS CURRENTLY THAT

03:18:01.803 --> 03:18:03.504
WAS MY CONCERN AS WELL. THANK

PUT THE COVER NINETEEN PANDEMIC

03:18:09.978 --> 03:18:12.080
UNDERSCORES. THE PROTECTION OF

03:18:12.146 --> 03:18:13.381
FRAGILE INTACT ECOSYSTEMS

03:18:13.448 --> 03:18:14.415
CRITICAL TO PUBLIC HEALTH WELL

03:18:14.482 --> 03:18:18.386
BEING- NOT ONLY. IS THE

03:18:18.453 --> 03:18:20.255
PROTECTION OF OUR BIODIVERSITY

03:18:20.321 --> 03:18:23.157
AND- OUR OUR ECOSYSTEMS

03:18:23.224 --> 03:18:24.826
CRITICAL BUT WE CAN SEE RIGHT

03:18:24.892 --> 03:18:26.060
NOW IN THE PAST FEW MONTHS

03:18:26.127 --> 03:18:27.262
WE'VE BEEN ASKED TO SHELTER AT

03:18:27.328 --> 03:18:29.330
HOME. THAT ACCESS TO AN EVENT

03:18:29.397 --> 03:18:32.533
AND AVAILABILITY- AND THE

03:18:32.600 --> 03:18:34.502
PRESENCE OF OUR OPEN SPACES AND

03:18:34.569 --> 03:18:36.738
PROTECTED SPACES- HAS BEEN ONE

03:18:36.804 --> 03:18:38.906
OF THE FEW RESPITE THREE BEEN

03:18:38.973 --> 03:18:43.278
ALLOWED. TO AN AGENT. AS TO THE

03:18:43.344 --> 03:18:44.912
PROTECTIONS OF THE ECOSYSTEMS

03:18:44.979 --> 03:18:46.614
DO NOT DISEASES LIKE OVER

03:18:46.681 --> 03:18:48.583
NINETEEN RESULT FROM HUMAN

03:18:48.650 --> 03:18:49.117
WILDLIFE INTERACTIONS LIKE

03:18:49.183 --> 03:18:51.886
THOSE THAT OCCURRED- IT THROUGH

03:18:51.953 --> 03:18:53.821
INCLUSION ON WILDLIFE HABITAT

03:18:53.888 --> 03:18:54.756
PROTECTING MORE OPEN SPACE WILL

03:18:54.822 --> 03:18:56.257
DECREASE HUMAN CONTACT WILDLIFE

03:18:56.324 --> 03:18:58.026
TO TRAVEL DECREASES BUT AS

03:18:58.092 --> 03:19:00.061
OXY'S IS HUMANS- I CAN

03:19:00.128 --> 03:19:01.095
UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING

03:19:01.162 --> 03:19:03.064
I'M SORRY YOU'RE YOU'RE RACING

03:19:03.131 --> 03:19:06.467
THROUGH SOMETHING FOR- IT THE-

03:19:06.534 --> 03:19:08.436
A COUPLE DIFFERENT THINGS AND

03:19:08.503 --> 03:19:10.938
SO ONE IS A PROTECT PROTECT

03:19:11.005 --> 03:19:14.676
MORE OPEN DECREASES HUMAN

03:19:14.742 --> 03:19:17.278
CONTACT WITH WILDLIFE WHICH IN

03:19:17.345 --> 03:19:20.214
TURN WILL DO THIS FOR. HUMAN

03:19:20.281 --> 03:19:22.216
SIGN UP FOR JUST GOT I'M TRYING

03:19:22.283 --> 03:19:22.984
TO GET SOME BREAD FROM BUT YOU

03:19:23.051 --> 03:19:24.652
EXT THAT THAT WE'RE GONNA BE

03:19:24.719 --> 03:19:28.623
FIGHTING COVETED TWENTY THIRTY.

03:19:28.690 --> 03:19:30.692
IF IT'S NOT OPEN TO BE OTHER.

03:19:30.758 --> 03:19:34.429
RESULTS OF US NOT- NOT BEING

03:19:34.495 --> 03:19:36.030
CONSCIOUS OF PROTECTING

03:19:36.097 --> 03:19:37.665
BIODIVERSITY THERE'S NO DOUBT

03:19:37.732 --> 03:19:38.900
ABOUT THAT AND WE'VE SEEN

03:19:38.966 --> 03:19:41.035
INCREASE OF DISEASE IS BASED

03:19:41.102 --> 03:19:42.670
UPON OUR DESTRUCTION ABOUT

03:19:42.737 --> 03:19:44.839
DIVERSITY. ABOUT SEPARATE FROM

03:19:44.906 --> 03:19:46.174
THAT IS THE IDEA OF HAVING

03:19:46.240 --> 03:19:47.842
ENSURING I THINK THE LAST FEW

03:19:47.909 --> 03:19:50.311
MONTHS OF SHOWN ACCESS TO

03:19:50.378 --> 03:19:52.680
MEANINGFUL RECREATION. OUTDOOR

03:19:52.747 --> 03:19:56.684
SPACES WATER. OCEAN RIVER WAYS

03:19:56.751 --> 03:19:58.920
PARKS OPEN SPACES HAS BEEN

03:19:58.986 --> 03:20:00.455
CRITICAL FOR OUR MENTAL HEALTH

03:20:00.521 --> 03:20:01.823
IN REVIEWING YOUR BILL IT HAS

03:20:01.889 --> 03:20:03.224
NO MENTION OF ACCESS AND I'LL

03:20:03.291 --> 03:20:05.526
I'LL EXPLAIN THAT BECAUSE- I'M

03:20:05.593 --> 03:20:06.828
VERY FAMILIAR WITH CALIFORNIA'S

03:20:06.894 --> 03:20:08.730
COAST AND OPEN SPACES AND A LOT

03:20:08.796 --> 03:20:10.698
OF THOSE ARE PROTECTED AND

03:20:10.765 --> 03:20:13.267
DON'T ALLOW ACCESS. AND YOUR

03:20:13.334 --> 03:20:15.603
BILL HAS NO MENTION RELATED TO

03:20:15.670 --> 03:20:16.904
ACCESS AND I THINK IT'S VERY

03:20:16.971 --> 03:20:18.973
IMPORTANT THAT WERE ALLOWED TO

03:20:19.040 --> 03:20:22.043
ACCESS OPEN SPACE AND HIS. ARE

03:20:22.110 --> 03:20:25.113
BOTH LOCKED. SO I WILL LIKE TO

03:20:25.179 --> 03:20:27.115
SEE IS LEVEL OF MENTION THAT AS

03:20:27.181 --> 03:20:29.183
THIS MOVES FORWARD. THAT WE

03:20:29.250 --> 03:20:31.185
MAKE REFERENCE TO ACCESS

03:20:31.252 --> 03:20:32.153
BECAUSE YOU'RE MAKING THAT

03:20:32.220 --> 03:20:33.654
ARGUMENT FROM THE PODIUM BUT

03:20:33.721 --> 03:20:35.656
IT'S NOT IN THE BILL. OF THAT

03:20:35.723 --> 03:20:36.991
THE OTHER THING I'D LIKE TO

03:20:37.058 --> 03:20:40.862
ADDRESS HIS- THE 30% NUMBER

03:20:40.928 --> 03:20:42.797
WHAT'S THAT I MEAN I MEAN. I'M%

03:20:42.864 --> 03:20:44.565
I'M OK IF IT'S NOT BUT I JUST

03:20:44.632 --> 03:20:45.867
WANT UNDERSTAND WHAT WHAT

03:20:45.933 --> 03:20:48.403
AMOUNT OF LAND. AND HAS SINCE

03:20:48.469 --> 03:20:50.138
BEEN ABLE HAVE WE BEEN ABLE TO

03:20:50.204 --> 03:20:52.240
BECAUSE WE HAVE. FEDERAL BLM

03:20:52.306 --> 03:20:54.308
LANDS WE HAVE STATE LANDS WE

03:20:54.375 --> 03:20:57.111
HAVE FEDERAL. PARK LANDS WE

03:20:57.178 --> 03:20:59.547
HAVE. BOB PROTECTED LANDS THAT

03:20:59.614 --> 03:21:01.215
WE'VE ENTERED INTO AGREEMENTS

03:21:01.282 --> 03:21:03.418
WITH PRIVATE OWNERS WE YOU KNOW

03:21:03.484 --> 03:21:06.053
FRANKLY THERE ARE SOME REALLY

03:21:06.120 --> 03:21:07.021
REACH BRIDGE PEOPLE ON THE

03:21:07.088 --> 03:21:08.322
COAST OF CALIFORNIA AND THEY

03:21:08.389 --> 03:21:09.323
HAVE BEEN ABLE TO RAISE A LOT

03:21:09.390 --> 03:21:10.758
OF MONEY TO PURCHASE LAND

03:21:10.825 --> 03:21:11.926
AROUND THEIR PROPERTY SO THAT

03:21:11.993 --> 03:21:13.828
THEY'RE NEVER DEVELOPED. WELL

03:21:13.895 --> 03:21:15.496
IT IT SERVES FOR TWO PURPOSES

03:21:15.563 --> 03:21:16.931
TO PROTECT OUR COASTAL VIEWS I

03:21:16.998 --> 03:21:19.066
GET IT AND THAT NOBODY EVER BUT

03:21:19.133 --> 03:21:23.037
IT ALSO HAS. A OF UP TO PROTECT

03:21:23.104 --> 03:21:24.672
THAT LAND FOR MARINE DIVERSITY

03:21:24.739 --> 03:21:26.507
AND THEY GET A BIG TAX BREAK IN

03:21:26.574 --> 03:21:28.042
DOING THAT. THEY THEY THEY

03:21:28.109 --> 03:21:31.746
RAISE MONEY TO A NON TO ACCESS

03:21:31.813 --> 03:21:33.781
A SLOW AND THEN. THEY GET TO

03:21:33.848 --> 03:21:36.050
BASICALLY USE IT FOR THEIR OWN

03:21:36.117 --> 03:21:37.452
PURPOSE BUT THERE'S NO PUBLIC

03:21:37.518 --> 03:21:38.820
ACCESS AND THAT I HOPE THAT

03:21:38.886 --> 03:21:40.521
WE'RE NOT ENGAGING IN THAT KIND

03:21:40.588 --> 03:21:43.558
OF ACTIVITY TO THIS BILL

03:21:43.624 --> 03:21:44.692
BECAUSE IT DOESN'T REALLY. HELP

03:21:44.759 --> 03:21:47.228
US WITH WITH ACCESS AND FROM

03:21:47.295 --> 03:21:48.463
MUCH MORE LIMITED BENEFITS AND

03:21:48.529 --> 03:21:51.566
I. AND YOU KNOW WE CAN'T DO

03:21:51.632 --> 03:21:53.267
THAT IN POOR AREAS WE CAN ONLY

03:21:53.334 --> 03:21:55.369
DO THAT IN AND RICH AREAS IN

03:21:55.436 --> 03:21:56.404
CALIFORNIA WHERE POOR PEOPLE

03:21:56.471 --> 03:21:58.439
LIVE. THEY DON'T GET ACCESS TO

03:21:58.506 --> 03:22:00.241
OPEN SPACE AND PROTECTED LANDS

03:22:00.308 --> 03:22:03.377
AND FAXES TO REVIEW SPECIES AND

03:22:03.444 --> 03:22:04.712
INTERACT WITH THEM AND

03:22:04.779 --> 03:22:06.247
HOPEFULLY LEARN ABOUT THEIR

03:22:06.314 --> 03:22:07.615
THEIR OBLIGATIONS TO PROTECTING

03:22:07.682 --> 03:22:09.517
THEMSELVES THAT'S THE STORY OF

03:22:09.584 --> 03:22:10.918
CALIFORNIA AND I'M NOT

03:22:10.985 --> 03:22:12.253
INTERESTED N FURTHERING A

03:22:12.320 --> 03:22:14.121
POLICY THAT WILL DO THAT AND-

03:22:14.188 --> 03:22:15.423
SO THAT'S WHY I ACCESS IS

03:22:15.490 --> 03:22:17.592
IMPORTANT STRATEGIC. LOCATION

03:22:17.658 --> 03:22:20.595
OF THESE IS ALSO IMPORTANT I.

03:22:20.661 --> 03:22:22.296
AND THAT'S NOT MENTIONED IN THE

03:22:22.363 --> 03:22:24.699
BILL AS WELL. AND I'D LIKE TO

03:22:24.765 --> 03:22:26.267
SEE IF YOU COULD WORK IN GOOD

03:22:26.334 --> 03:22:29.403
FAITH TO ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES.

03:22:29.470 --> 03:22:31.038
HOW DID YOU COME UP WITH A 30%

03:22:31.105 --> 03:22:32.840
NUMBER AND HOW MUCH DO WE

03:22:32.907 --> 03:22:35.710
CURRENTLY HAVE. UNDER

03:22:35.776 --> 03:22:36.177
PROTECTION INSTEAD OF

03:22:36.244 --> 03:22:38.112
CALIFORNIA. FIRST OF ALL IF I

03:22:38.179 --> 03:22:40.515
COULD- SUNDER- THE BILL DOES

03:22:40.581 --> 03:22:42.183
SPECIFICALLY STATE THAT IS THE

03:22:42.250 --> 03:22:44.318
GOAL OF THE STATE EVEN THIS

03:22:44.385 --> 03:22:46.687
BILL. REPRESENTING THAT TO

03:22:46.754 --> 03:22:47.722
IMPROVE ACCESS TO NATURE FOR

03:22:47.788 --> 03:22:49.156
ALL PEOPLE BUT THERE'S A REASON

03:22:49.223 --> 03:22:51.025
WHY I WAS RULES ONE OF THE KEYS

03:22:51.092 --> 03:22:52.927
GROUP OF CO SPONSORS. OF THIS

03:22:52.994 --> 03:22:54.328
BILL AND HOW DO YOU FIND ALL

03:22:54.395 --> 03:22:56.364
PEOPLE THOUGH I MEAN WHEN YOU

03:22:56.430 --> 03:22:57.732
GO INTO THE CENTRAL VALLEY PRO

03:22:57.798 --> 03:22:59.667
COUNTY THAT. AREAS IN MY

03:22:59.734 --> 03:23:01.235
COMMUNITY SAN DIEGO IT SOME

03:23:01.302 --> 03:23:02.637
PEOPLE HAVE A HARD TIME AYE WE

03:23:02.703 --> 03:23:03.638
HAVE TO PUT MONEY IN THE

03:23:03.704 --> 03:23:05.473
BUDGET. TO GET PEOPLE FROM

03:23:05.540 --> 03:23:07.675
ENGLAND TO THE COAST. UNLESS

03:23:07.742 --> 03:23:09.176
SOMETHING THROUGH A DIRECT.

03:23:09.243 --> 03:23:11.412
GOVERNMENT SUPPORT AND IF I

03:23:11.479 --> 03:23:12.780
MEAN OF THE BILL IS MORE

03:23:12.847 --> 03:23:14.382
SPECIFIC ON THAT I'D LOVE TO

03:23:14.448 --> 03:23:15.583
SEE THAT BECAUSE THAT IS

03:23:15.650 --> 03:23:18.786
IMPORTANT YES NO THANK YOU- THE

03:23:18.853 --> 03:23:20.688
BUILD ACTUALLY THAT'S PART OF.

03:23:20.755 --> 03:23:22.056
ONE OF THE MAIN PURPOSE OF THE

03:23:22.123 --> 03:23:25.192
BILL PAYS FOR IT TOO AS WE-

03:23:25.259 --> 03:23:29.897
PROTECT LANDS A PRACTICAL.

03:23:29.964 --> 03:23:31.132
PRECIPITATING WAS NEVER NOT

03:23:31.198 --> 03:23:31.899
PRESCRIPTIVE AND HOW WE DO IT.

03:23:31.966 --> 03:23:33.334
BECAUSE AGAIN THIS IS A THE GO.

03:23:33.401 --> 03:23:33.901
HOWEVER IT DOES VERY SPUR.

03:23:33.968 --> 03:23:35.202
STATE PARTICULARLY FOR

03:23:35.269 --> 03:23:36.470
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES

COASTLINE PROTECT POSSIBLY.

03:28:54.655 --> 03:28:56.423
BECAUSE YOU SAID WE'RE AT 60%

03:28:56.490 --> 03:28:58.125
OF US MARINE PROTECTED AREAS OF

03:28:58.192 --> 03:28:59.960
16% YES THAT'S A THAT'S

03:29:00.027 --> 03:29:01.362
ACCORDING TO THE ESTIMATES AS

03:29:01.428 --> 03:29:03.297
INDICATED IN THE AND THE STAFF

03:29:03.364 --> 03:29:07.468
ANALYSIS- SO THIS FIFTY TO THE

03:29:07.534 --> 03:29:08.502
STATE OPTIONS WHAT IS

03:29:08.569 --> 03:29:09.970

REQUEST AND YOU KNOW HOW THAT

03:29:16.944 --> 03:29:18.145
WE DO WE DEFINE THAT BECAUSE

03:29:18.212 --> 03:29:19.513
SINCE AND WE HAVE AREAS THAT

03:29:19.580 --> 03:29:20.414
ARE NOT PROTECT MARINE

03:29:20.481 --> 03:29:21.949
PROTECTED AREAS BUT ARE ALSO

03:29:22.016 --> 03:29:24.018
PROTECTED AREAS. ALONG SAN

CUMULATIVE NUMBER ABSOLUTELY

03:29:30.791 --> 03:29:31.792
THE OF IT I THINK THAT THIS IS

03:29:31.859 --> 03:29:33.594
NOT A COMPREHENSIVE PERCENTAGE

03:29:33.661 --> 03:29:35.496
IS PROBABLY MUCH HIGHER THAN A

03:29:35.562 --> 03:29:37.531
16% THAT WAS THE MOST. EASILY

03:29:37.598 --> 03:29:39.500
ACCESSIBLE DATA POINT BECAUSE

03:29:39.566 --> 03:29:41.402
IT'S EASY TO FIND THOSE THE

03:29:41.468 --> 03:29:42.569

03:29:45.839 --> 03:29:49.310
WILL INTO THAT ALSO. YOU THE

03:29:49.376 --> 03:29:50.678

ALSO SOME UNTREATED I MEAN

03:29:56.517 --> 03:29:58.319
WE'VE DECIMATED. THE IN THE

03:29:58.385 --> 03:29:59.954

THAT NOW. IN CAL IF YOU LOOK AT

03:39:03.730 --> 03:39:05.298
THE TYPES OF PROTECTION THAT

03:39:05.365 --> 03:39:06.099
ARE CALLED FOR BY THE

03:39:06.166 --> 03:39:09.603

03:39:41.101 --> 03:39:43.403
ADDRESS- BIG CONCERN THAT WE'VE

03:39:43.470 --> 03:39:45.238

ENGAGE IN UNPROTECTED. IN THAT

03:39:58.919 --> 03:40:00.320
IT PAYS TO PROVIDE CONTRIVING

03:40:00.387 --> 03:40:01.755
BIODIVERSITY AND THERE'S NO

03:40:01.821 --> 03:40:03.590
PROBLEM BECAUSE THAT DEFINITION

03:40:03.657 --> 03:40:05.125
ALLOWS FOR THOSE ACTIVITIES

03:40:05.191 --> 03:40:07.427
THAT SUPPORT ABOUT DIVERSITY.

03:40:07.494 --> 03:40:08.895
IT'S NOT CLEAR WHAT IT MEANS IS

03:40:08.962 --> 03:40:10.497
RESULT IN REDUCED ACCESS TO

03:40:10.564 --> 03:40:12.899
SPECIALLY CONSIDERING THE FACT.

03:40:12.966 --> 03:40:16.770
THAT IT DOESN'T CALLS FOR

03:40:16.836 --> 03:40:19.072
EXPANSION OF AT GREAT PROTECTED

03:40:19.139 --> 03:40:21.041

LONG BIODIVERSITY IS AND ON THE

03:40:36.590 --> 03:40:39.593
ALLOWED IN THOSE AREAS I ALSO

03:40:39.659 --> 03:40:41.561

COLLEAGUE FROM SAN DIEGO HAD

03:41:50.130 --> 03:41:52.532
STARTED OFF WITH A QUESTION

03:41:52.599 --> 03:41:54.434
THAT I THINK IS IMPORTANT TO

03:41:54.501 --> 03:41:55.935
ASK BECAUSEIT ALSO BEARS

03:41:56.002 --> 03:41:58.905
DIRECTLY ON. THE URGENCY OF

03:41:58.972 --> 03:42:01.074
THIS MATTER AND WHETHER NOT

03:42:01.141 --> 03:42:02.642
THAT EXISTS WE'VE BEEN ASKED.

03:42:02.709 --> 03:42:06.279
THAT WE DEAL. WITH RELATED

03:42:06.346 --> 03:42:08.982
MATTERS WILDFIRE IN HOUSING

03:42:09.049 --> 03:42:11.151
THAT WAS THE ORIGINAL- A

03:42:11.217 --> 03:42:14.487
RECOMMENDATION BY THE PRO TEM I

03:42:14.554 --> 03:42:17.624
THINK IT'S CLEAR THAT THERE ARE

03:42:17.691 --> 03:42:21.227
SO MANY EXAMPLES THE FAT THAT

03:42:21.294 --> 03:42:23.463
WE'VE GONE ABOVE AND BEYOND

03:42:23.530 --> 03:42:27.801
THOSE- PARAMETERS. AND I LOVE

03:42:27.867 --> 03:42:31.371
THE VERBAL GYMNASTICS OF TRYING

03:42:31.438 --> 03:42:34.607
TO CREATE A NEXUS THE CODE. IT

03:42:34.674 --> 03:42:35.842
GETS JUST MORE INNER ALL THE

03:42:35.909 --> 03:42:40.280
TIME- THAT IS A MAIN. I FIND

03:42:40.346 --> 03:42:41.448
I'M HARD PRESSED TO THINK IF

03:42:41.514 --> 03:42:43.983
THIS IS COVERED RELATED BUT

03:42:44.050 --> 03:42:46.319
MOVING BEYOND THAT BECAUSE I

03:42:46.386 --> 03:42:47.053
THINK IT'S HERE NOW THE

03:42:47.120 --> 03:42:49.756
CHAIRMAN DECIDED TO ALLOW THE

03:42:49.823 --> 03:42:52.859
ROSTER BILLS. TO MOVE FORWARD

03:42:52.926 --> 03:42:55.195
IN THE WAY THAT HE DID. BUT I'M

03:42:55.261 --> 03:42:59.232
LOOKING AT THIS. IT'S ALMOST AS

03:42:59.299 --> 03:43:01.668
IF THIS SEEMS. LIKE WE'RE

03:43:01.735 --> 03:43:05.672
JUMPING AHEAD OF A PROCESS I

03:43:05.739 --> 03:43:07.640
THINK- YOU'D APPRECIATE THIS AS

03:43:07.707 --> 03:43:08.341
AN ATTORNEY IN FACT MY

03:43:08.408 --> 03:43:09.442
UNDERSTANDING IS THAT PROVIDE

03:43:09.509 --> 03:43:12.112
WANTED SAME LAW SCHOOL- SO I

03:43:12.178 --> 03:43:18.284
THINK- THE- IS THAT. IS THAT.

03:43:18.351 --> 03:43:19.619
THIS IS AN ASPIRATIONAL

03:43:19.686 --> 03:43:24.057
DOCUMENT. IT DOESN'T HAVE SET

03:43:24.124 --> 03:43:25.391
POLICIES IT DOES NOT HAVE

03:43:25.458 --> 03:43:27.060
METRICS IT DOES NOT HAVE CLEAR

03:43:27.127 --> 03:43:30.630
DIRECTION. EXCEPT FOR THE

03:43:30.697 --> 03:43:32.332
NOTION THAT WE WANT TO MAKE

03:43:32.398 --> 03:43:35.001
CERTAIN THAT 30% IS ACHIEVED

03:43:35.068 --> 03:43:37.003
ART WHETHER IT BE THE NATIONAL

03:43:37.070 --> 03:43:38.138
LEVEL OR A COMBINATION OF

03:43:38.204 --> 03:43:40.607
STATES IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE

03:43:40.673 --> 03:43:42.442
OVERALL INTERNATIONAL SET OF

03:43:42.509 --> 03:43:45.945
OBLIGATIONS. BUT THE ISSUE IS.

03:43:46.012 --> 03:43:47.247
BASED ON THE CONVERSATIONS THAT

03:43:47.313 --> 03:43:48.882
I'VE HAD IN THE COMMENTS THAT

03:43:48.948 --> 03:43:51.184
I'VE HEARD FROM FOLKS THAT RELY

03:43:51.251 --> 03:43:54.587
ON THESE RELATED INDUSTRIES

03:43:54.654 --> 03:43:55.188
THAT BELIEVE THAT THEY WILL BE

03:43:55.255 --> 03:43:56.422
IMPACTED. WOULD IT NOT BE

03:43:56.489 --> 03:44:00.026
APPROPRIATE. FOR US INSTEAD OF

03:44:00.093 --> 03:44:04.197
A MAN DAY A LEGISLATIVE MANDATE

03:44:04.264 --> 03:44:05.932
IN AN ASPIRATIONAL FORM OF

03:44:05.999 --> 03:44:07.967
THIRTY PERCENT. TO INSTEAD

03:44:08.034 --> 03:44:11.437
DIRECT THE STATE INSTRUMENTS

03:44:11.504 --> 03:44:13.439
THE STATE AGENCY AND IN THEIR

03:44:13.506 --> 03:44:15.375
IN THE RELEVANT DEPARTMENT. TO

03:44:15.441 --> 03:44:17.877
DEVISE WAYS THAT WOULD BE

03:44:17.944 --> 03:44:19.279
BROUGHT BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE

03:44:19.345 --> 03:44:21.581
ON WHAT THINGS THEY WOULD DO TO

03:44:21.648 --> 03:44:23.750
BE ABLE TO ACHIEVE. THE NUMBERS

03:44:23.817 --> 03:44:25.518
THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT BECAUSE I

03:44:25.585 --> 03:44:26.119
THINK WITH THE FEAR THAT WE'RE

03:44:26.186 --> 03:44:28.888
HEARING. FOLKS IN THE FISHERIES

03:44:28.955 --> 03:44:30.557
FOLKS IN WILDLIFE FOLKS IN

03:44:30.623 --> 03:44:33.092
AGRICULTURE. THE FEAR THAT

03:44:33.159 --> 03:44:33.593
WE'RE HEARING IN THEIR

03:44:33.660 --> 03:44:38.298
OPPOSITION. IS ONE OF. DISTRUST

03:44:38.364 --> 03:44:40.200
WE'RE WE'RE IS GOING TO GO IN

03:44:40.266 --> 03:44:42.235
COULD THIS ULTIMATELY IMPACT

03:44:42.302 --> 03:44:44.437
THEIR LIVELIHOOD. AND I THINK

03:44:44.504 --> 03:44:46.472
THERE'S MERIT TO THAT IT'S

03:44:46.539 --> 03:44:48.608
THOSE SETS OF CONCERNS. SO

03:44:48.675 --> 03:44:50.043
WOULD IT MAY BE MORE

03:44:50.109 --> 03:44:52.145
APPROPRIATE TO USE THIS

03:44:52.212 --> 03:44:54.848
LEGISLATIVE VEHICLE TO DIRECT

03:44:54.914 --> 03:44:58.017
THE STATE AGENTS. TO SAY THIS

03:44:58.084 --> 03:44:59.886
IS WHAT WE'D LIKE TO SEE HAPPEN

03:44:59.953 --> 03:45:01.421
PLEASE REPORT BACK TO THE

03:45:01.487 --> 03:45:03.823
LEGISLATURE. ON HOW IT COULD BE

03:45:03.890 --> 03:45:07.994
ACCOMPLISHED IN WHAT FASHION.

03:45:08.061 --> 03:45:09.262
SECOND PART OF THAT WOULD BE

03:45:09.329 --> 03:45:11.631
SINCE WE'RE IN COORDINATION. ON

03:45:11.698 --> 03:45:13.199
THE ROAD WITH OTHER STATES AND

03:45:13.266 --> 03:45:15.134
FEDERAL AUTHORITIES. HOW

03:45:15.201 --> 03:45:16.302
EXACTLY THEY WOULD BE DOING THE

03:45:16.369 --> 03:45:19.038
SAME THING. BECAUSE I THINK ONE

03:45:19.105 --> 03:45:20.106
OF THE CONCERNS IS THAT IF

03:45:20.173 --> 03:45:21.307
WE'RE PUSHING THIS FROM A

03:45:21.374 --> 03:45:22.709
NATIONAL THE INTERNATIONAL

03:45:22.775 --> 03:45:25.645
STANDPOINT. AND WE AT WE I

03:45:25.712 --> 03:45:27.180
THINK WE'VE HEARD FROM FOLKS

03:45:27.247 --> 03:45:29.182
THAT WASHINGTON HAS DIFFERENT

03:45:29.249 --> 03:45:30.917
ENVIRONMENTAL POLICIES THAN

03:45:30.984 --> 03:45:33.253
CALIFORNIA. WILL CALIFORNIA

03:45:33.319 --> 03:45:36.256
ENDEAVOR TO MAKE UP THE SLACK.

03:45:36.322 --> 03:45:37.824
MEETING THAT WE COULD EXCEED

03:45:37.891 --> 03:45:40.727
THAT 30% IF THE MAJORITY OF

03:45:40.793 --> 03:45:43.196
AMERICA DOES NOT IN EFFORT TO

03:45:43.263 --> 03:45:46.266
MEET THE 30% INTERNATIONALLY OR

03:45:46.332 --> 03:45:48.368
NATIONALLY. SO YOU CAN SEE WHY

03:45:48.434 --> 03:45:49.869
THERE ARE A LOT OF FOLKS ARE

03:45:49.936 --> 03:45:53.506
TERRIBLY CONCERNED ABOUT THAT.

03:45:53.573 --> 03:45:54.841
AND THEN LASTLY IS THAT IF WE

03:45:54.908 --> 03:45:57.677
REACHED. IT CONTEXT

03:45:57.744 --> 03:45:59.145
UNDERSTANDING OF WHERE WE FIT

03:45:59.212 --> 03:46:02.081
IN TO THIS LARGER AGENDA THAT'D

03:46:02.148 --> 03:46:04.250
BE MEMORIALIZED IN LEGISLATION

03:46:04.317 --> 03:46:05.952
AND BROUGHT BACK TO US SO MY

03:46:06.019 --> 03:46:08.187
ULTIMATE POINT IN ALL THIS IS

03:46:08.254 --> 03:46:12.191
THAT. THIS VEHICLE IT DOESN'T

03:46:12.258 --> 03:46:16.496
HAVE SUBSTANCE IT IT IS

03:46:16.562 --> 03:46:19.232
ASPIRATIONAL MANDATE. BUT THE

03:46:19.299 --> 03:46:22.035
CONSEQUENCES COULD BE SO SEVERE

03:46:22.101 --> 03:46:23.569
THAT WE ARE ABDICATING OR

03:46:23.636 --> 03:46:26.105
LEGISLATIVE RESPONSIBILITIES IN

03:46:26.172 --> 03:46:28.174
ALLOWING REGULATORY AGENCIES

03:46:28.241 --> 03:46:30.043
THE WEIGHT OF THE LAW IN

03:46:30.109 --> 03:46:33.279
AUTHORITY TO DEVISE POLICIES TO

03:46:33.346 --> 03:46:36.282
ACHIEVE WHAT THIS LEGISLATION

03:46:36.349 --> 03:46:39.185
ENDEAVORS. AND THAT I THINK IS

03:46:39.252 --> 03:46:40.320
TERRIBLY DANGEROUS FOR THE

03:46:40.386 --> 03:46:42.055
TRADITION OF THE LEGISLATIVE

03:46:42.121 --> 03:46:44.657
BODY AS A CO EQUAL BRANCH OF

03:46:44.724 --> 03:46:45.291
GOVERNMENT WE'VE HEARD OVER AND

03:46:45.358 --> 03:46:47.560
OVER AGAIN. SO MY POINT ALLEN

03:46:47.627 --> 03:46:50.196
ALLEN TO HEAR. IS THAT NOT ONLY

03:46:50.263 --> 03:46:55.101
IS NOT CODED RELATED AT ALL. WE

03:46:55.168 --> 03:46:57.603
ARE CREATING MORE UNCERTAINTY

03:46:57.670 --> 03:47:00.006
IN THE MARKET PLACE. AT A TIME

03:47:00.073 --> 03:47:01.941
WHEN WE ARE DESPERATE FOR JOBS

03:47:02.008 --> 03:47:05.912
IN CERTAINTY IN THE MARKETPLACE.

03:47:05.979 --> 03:47:11.084
AND LASTLY WE ARE NOT ACTING IN

03:47:11.150 --> 03:47:13.119
A LEGISLATIVE CAPACITY THAT

03:47:13.186 --> 03:47:15.989
GOES INTO SPECIFICITY ON WHAT

03:47:16.055 --> 03:47:16.556
THIS WOULD MEAN FOR RELATED

03:47:16.622 --> 03:47:20.026
AREAS OR INDUSTRIES. AND I

03:47:20.093 --> 03:47:22.261
THINK IT MIGHT BE THE WAY THAT

03:47:22.328 --> 03:47:23.796
THEY SHOULD BE DONE BASED ON

03:47:23.863 --> 03:47:24.497
THE COMMENT I HEARD JUST A

03:47:24.564 --> 03:47:26.733
MOMENT AGO THIS IS TO

03:47:26.799 --> 03:47:29.902
SIGNIFICANT. TO JAM THROUGH. IN

03:47:29.969 --> 03:47:33.606
AUGUST. WOULD IT WOULD NOT ALL

03:47:33.673 --> 03:47:35.308
BE BETTER SERVED IF THIS WERE

03:47:35.375 --> 03:47:37.744
BROUGHT IN JANUARY AND HAD THE

03:47:37.810 --> 03:47:39.679
FULL WEIGHT OF DEBATE IN THE

03:47:39.746 --> 03:47:44.617
FULL WEIGHT. OF THE EXPLICATION

03:47:44.684 --> 03:47:45.151
OF THE ISSUES. THANK YOU

03:47:46.552 --> 03:47:47.653

THIS POINT- OR WOULD YOU LIKE

03:47:49.856 --> 03:47:52.825

AND ALLOW ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS

03:48:04.570 --> 03:48:05.304
FOR AND AGAINST TO BE PART OF

03:48:05.371 --> 03:48:08.674

03:48:17.183 --> 03:48:17.984
IMPLEMENTATION A RESPONSE FOR.

03:48:18.051 --> 03:48:21.487
A OF THE METRICS. BUT WE'VE

03:48:21.554 --> 03:48:24.090
DONE THIS IN OTHER ARENAS AND

03:48:24.157 --> 03:48:25.324
IT'S MAKING ABOUT WHETHER IT'S

03:48:25.391 --> 03:48:26.926

AND DAN. HOW COULD I GOAL IS

03:48:31.531 --> 03:48:34.801
SET SUBSCRIPT LEGISLATION OR

03:48:34.867 --> 03:48:35.768
SUCH COULD MINISTRATION ACTION

03:48:35.835 --> 03:48:36.602
IS GOOD. HELPS US ACHIEVE THAT

03:48:36.669 --> 03:48:39.105
GOAL AND SO. THAT WE CAN GO TO

03:48:39.172 --> 03:48:40.039
ADMINISTRATION I MEAN TO YOUR

03:48:40.106 --> 03:48:44.077
POINT. WITH THE MESSAGE I TELL

03:48:44.143 --> 03:48:44.677
THEM TO TELL US WHAT. WE WANT

03:48:44.744 --> 03:48:45.878
WHAT ONE TO DO WHAT WE CAN SAY

03:48:45.945 --> 03:48:46.846
THIS IS OUR GOAL BASS ON THE

03:48:46.913 --> 03:48:50.049
SIZE. AND BASED UPON THE

03:48:50.116 --> 03:48:51.217
FEEDBACK WE'VE GOTTEN BY THE

03:48:51.284 --> 03:48:54.454

THIS BILL. CLICK TO DOESN'T

03:48:57.223 --> 03:48:59.092
INTENTIONALLY IS NOT

03:48:59.158 --> 03:49:00.193
PRESCRIPTIVE IN FACT SOME OF

03:49:00.259 --> 03:49:02.028
THE SPECIFICITY THAT WE STRUCK

03:49:02.095 --> 03:49:04.097
RESTRICT. BASED ON FEEDBACK

03:49:04.163 --> 03:49:05.765
FROM THE OPPOSITION BECAUSE

03:49:05.832 --> 03:49:07.033
THEY DIDN'T WANT THAT LEVEL OF

03:49:07.100 --> 03:49:10.436
SPECIFICITY IN THERE AND SO DOT

03:49:10.503 --> 03:49:12.305
DOT. IT IS AN EFFORT FOR US TO

03:49:12.371 --> 03:49:13.806
CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THEM AND

03:49:13.873 --> 03:49:15.741
EVERYONE ELSE THE SPONSORS AND

03:49:15.808 --> 03:49:17.577
THE OPPOSITION SO THAT WE CAN

03:49:17.643 --> 03:49:20.113
ACHIEVE OR TWENTY THIRTY THIRTY

03:49:20.179 --> 03:49:23.249
BY THIRTY GOAL TOGETHER AND IS

03:49:23.316 --> 03:49:23.850
THAT WHAT WE'RE NOT GONNA TAKE

03:49:23.916 --> 03:49:24.951
ON THE PER OF OTHER STATES WE

03:49:25.017 --> 03:49:28.054
HAVE ARTICLE SOUTH CAROLINA. IN

03:49:28.121 --> 03:49:28.888
THE LEGISLATURE NOT THERE BY

03:49:28.955 --> 03:49:30.089
THIRTY OF LEGISLATION RIGHT NOW

03:49:30.156 --> 03:49:32.558
AS WELL. THE IDEA IS TO GET ALL

03:49:32.625 --> 03:49:34.160
STATES ENGAGE IN THIS PROCESS

03:49:34.227 --> 03:49:35.595
AS WELL AS THE FEDERAL

03:49:35.661 --> 03:49:37.630
GOVERNMENT BECAUSE THIS IS NOT

03:49:37.697 --> 03:49:38.731
JUST ONE IT'S NOT SOMETHING

03:49:38.798 --> 03:49:40.233
THAT JUST SOUTH CAROLINA JUST

03:49:40.299 --> 03:49:42.401
CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO DO. A DEBIT

03:49:42.468 --> 03:49:44.070
ASAL EFFORT THAT I THINK ALL

03:49:44.137 --> 03:49:49.642
ALONG CENTER PARKS. OF THE- WE

03:49:49.709 --> 03:49:50.977
CAN LEAD THE APPS. BY LEE SAID

03:49:51.043 --> 03:49:53.946
IN A- AND THEN ONCE GOAL IS WE

03:49:54.013 --> 03:49:55.581
WERE WITH THE FITNESS. IS TO

03:49:55.648 --> 03:49:57.550
WHAT. IS AS TO. HOW TO BEST

03:49:57.617 --> 03:49:59.085
ACHIEVE AS WELL. AS WITH THE

03:49:59.152 --> 03:50:01.320
OTHER IN FOLLOW UP LEGISLATION

03:50:01.387 --> 03:50:04.090
THAT MAKES SENSE- AND THIS BILL

03:50:04.157 --> 03:50:04.624
WAS INTRODUCED MONTHS AGO

03:50:04.690 --> 03:50:05.992
THERE'S NOT SOMETHING I JUST

03:50:06.058 --> 03:50:08.794
SHOWED UP. LOCKABLE WEEKS- AND

03:50:08.861 --> 03:50:10.196

ENGAGING AND ACTIVE I'LL GET

03:50:11.864 --> 03:50:12.932
INTO THAT A LITTLE BIT LATER ON

03:50:12.999 --> 03:50:14.667
TERMS TO ENGAGEMENT BUT YEAH

03:50:14.734 --> 03:50:16.402
THERE'S DIFFERENTWAYS. THIS IS

03:50:16.469 --> 03:50:17.403
AN APPROACHES. HEY WE HAVE A

03:50:17.470 --> 03:50:18.471
DIFFERENT OPINION ON THE

03:50:18.538 --> 03:50:19.672
APPROACH BUT I THINK THIS IS

03:50:19.739 --> 03:50:21.674
THE RIGHT WAY TO APPROACH IT.

03:50:21.741 --> 03:50:26.512

DO THINK THAT THERE ARE SOME

03:50:43.095 --> 03:50:44.463
CONCERNS REGARDING HE

03:50:44.530 --> 03:50:48.067
PERCENTAGE OF- STATE LANDS

03:50:48.134 --> 03:50:50.603
CURRENTLY ARE PROTECTED. I

03:50:50.670 --> 03:50:51.671
BELIEVE THAT THE CALIFORNIA

03:50:51.737 --> 03:50:53.806
NATURI SERVICES AGENCY PUTS THE

03:50:53.873 --> 03:50:55.541

03:51:00.246 --> 03:51:05.618
IS ON THAT ARE HOW THEY CAME UP

03:51:05.685 --> 03:51:09.388

03:53:35.901 --> 03:53:36.769
THAT DOESN'T MEAN THERE'S

03:53:36.836 --> 03:53:37.370
ACTUALLY LANGUAGE IN THE BILL

03:53:37.436 --> 03:53:40.639
THAT MAKES IT DEAL WITH ACCESS.

03:53:40.706 --> 03:53:43.542
AND IT'S WELL INTENTIONED BUT

03:53:43.609 --> 03:53:44.110
THERE'S BEEN SOME CIRCULAR

03:53:44.176 --> 03:53:46.979
REASONING AND YOU WANNA PROTECT

03:53:47.046 --> 03:53:48.047
AREAS AND CLOSE THEM. AND THEN

03:53:48.114 --> 03:53:49.782
YOU SAY THAT YOU WANT TO MAKE

03:53:49.849 --> 03:53:51.484
SURE THAT THEY HAVE ACCESS SO

03:53:51.550 --> 03:53:53.119
HOW DOES PROTECTING LAND WATER.

03:53:55.454 --> 03:53:57.089

COME BACK TO FORTY TWO OH

03:55:51.971 --> 03:55:55.107
THREE. SO THIS IS BEEN A

03:55:55.174 --> 03:55:58.644
FASCINATING DISCUSSION I HAVE

03:55:58.711 --> 03:56:00.513
NOW READ THIS BILL BACK AND

03:56:00.579 --> 03:56:01.947
FORTH SEVERAL TIMES WE'VE BEEN

03:56:02.014 --> 03:56:05.351
HERE BECAUSE THERE IS AND HAS

03:56:05.417 --> 03:56:08.754
BEEN. REAL CONCERN EXPRESSED

03:56:08.821 --> 03:56:11.524
THAT THIS LEGISLATION IS REALLY

03:56:11.590 --> 03:56:14.159
GOING TO UNDERMINE THE ABILITY

03:56:14.226 --> 03:56:16.128
OF OUR SPORT FISHERMEN TO FISH

03:56:16.195 --> 03:56:19.598
AND PEOPLE TO HIKE IN AND I'M

03:56:19.665 --> 03:56:21.267
LOOKING TO SEE WHERE IN THE

03:56:21.333 --> 03:56:25.871
BILL THAT COULD BE. INTERPRETED

03:56:25.938 --> 03:56:26.672
AS SUCH AND REALLY THE BOTTOM

03:56:26.739 --> 03:56:29.441
LINE IS THERE IS JUST AN

03:56:29.508 --> 03:56:31.577
INHERENT DISTRUST. THIS BILL IS

03:56:31.644 --> 03:56:34.046
PURELY ASPIRATIONAL AND I'M

03:56:34.113 --> 03:56:35.714
REMINDED ON THINGS THAT WE'VE

03:56:35.781 --> 03:56:37.316
DONE OVER THE LAST MANY YEARS

03:56:37.383 --> 03:56:38.350
THAT WERE ALSO PURELY

03:56:38.417 --> 03:56:41.987
ASPIRATIONAL BACK- I THINK

03:56:42.054 --> 03:56:44.957
PROBABLY IN THE YEAR TWO

03:56:45.024 --> 03:56:49.128
THOUSAND WE WANTED TO BECOME-

03:56:49.194 --> 03:56:53.198
USING. NON FOSSIL FUELS I THINK

03:56:53.265 --> 03:56:55.701
20% BY TWENTY TWENTY WE DID A

03:56:55.768 --> 03:56:57.469
BILL THE CALL FOR THAT IT

03:56:57.536 --> 03:56:58.404
DIDN'T SAY HOW WE WERE GOING TO

03:56:58.470 --> 03:57:00.773
DO IT. IT JUST SAID THIS IS OUR

03:57:00.839 --> 03:57:04.476
GOAL IN FACT WE REACH THAT 20%

03:57:04.543 --> 03:57:06.512
FORTY BEFORE TWENTY TWENTY.

03:57:06.579 --> 03:57:07.746
WHICH I THOUGHT WAS INTERESTING

03:57:07.813 --> 03:57:12.117
HOW DID OUR 30%OF GREENHOUSE

03:57:12.184 --> 03:57:13.953
GAS EMISSIONS I BELIEVE. BY THE

03:57:14.019 --> 03:57:16.989
FORTY HOUR PASHA LEGISLATION TO

03:57:17.056 --> 03:57:18.490
FIFTEEN ARE AND THEN IT ALSO

03:57:18.557 --> 03:57:20.259
DIDN'T TELL US HOW TO DO IT

03:57:20.326 --> 03:57:22.661
JUST THAT WE NEEDED TO DO IT IT

03:57:22.728 --> 03:57:24.797
HAD SOME GUIDELINES BUT THERE

03:57:24.863 --> 03:57:27.466
WAS REALLY NOT NO PRESCRIPTIVE.

03:57:27.533 --> 03:57:28.467
METHODOLOGY OR ANYTHING OF THE

03:57:28.534 --> 03:57:32.338
SORT THAT WAS USED. IT I'VE HAD

03:57:32.404 --> 03:57:33.539
PROBABLY MORE RESPONSE FROM MY

03:57:33.606 --> 03:57:35.307
LOCAL COMMUNITY ON THIS BILL

03:57:35.374 --> 03:57:37.009
THAN ANY OTHER BILL THIS YEAR

03:57:37.076 --> 03:57:38.777
AND I APPRECIATE THAT THE

03:57:38.844 --> 03:57:40.646
PASSION OF MY SPORT FISHER.

03:57:40.713 --> 03:57:42.781
INDUSTRY AND IN SANTA BARBARA I

03:57:42.848 --> 03:57:44.550
HAVE VERY DIFFERENT WHO ARE.

03:57:44.617 --> 03:57:46.085
PASSIONATE ABOUT SPORTS FISHING

03:57:46.151 --> 03:57:48.120
AND I'VE DONE IT IS WELL I'M

03:57:48.187 --> 03:57:49.888
NOT BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL BUT-

03:57:49.955 --> 03:57:51.857
BUT I HAVE TRIED AND I

03:57:51.924 --> 03:57:54.059
CERTAINLY APPRECIATED AS A VERY

03:57:54.126 --> 03:57:55.594
EXCITING SPORT IF YOU'RE ABLE

03:57:55.661 --> 03:57:57.730
TO LAND ANYTHING- BUT I'VE

03:57:57.796 --> 03:57:59.598
WATCHED PEOPLE DO IT. AND IT

03:57:59.665 --> 03:58:01.533
REALLY DOES TAKE A TALENTED AND

03:58:01.600 --> 03:58:03.802
AN INTENSITY OF COMMITMENT SO I

03:58:03.869 --> 03:58:05.904
DON'T WANT TO IN ANY WAY

03:58:05.971 --> 03:58:08.641
DOWNPLAY. THEIR CONCERNS EXCEPT

03:58:08.707 --> 03:58:12.911
TO SAY THERE REALLY. I THINK

03:58:12.978 --> 03:58:13.545
BASED UPON THE UNKNOWN.

03:58:13.612 --> 03:58:14.780
LAURENTIIS DEPENDING WHAT WE'RE

03:58:14.847 --> 03:58:17.082
GOING TO BE AT THIS BILL IS

03:58:17.149 --> 03:58:17.616
GOING TO BE CALLING FOR. I

03:58:17.683 --> 03:58:19.385
DON'T THINK IT CALLS FOR MUCH

03:58:19.451 --> 03:58:21.620
OTHER THAN A COMMITMENT TO

03:58:21.687 --> 03:58:23.055
SEEING THAT THIS HAPPENED AND

03:58:23.122 --> 03:58:27.092
SO- AND THEN I SHOULD I WANT

03:58:27.159 --> 03:58:28.427
TO. HELLO MY SHOW TO THE OF THE

03:58:28.494 --> 03:58:30.629
REMARKS MADE BY OUR CHAIR THERE

03:58:30.696 --> 03:58:32.297
ARE SOME REAL LEGITIMATE

03:58:32.364 --> 03:58:35.000
CONCERNS HERE- AGAIN WHEN WE

03:58:35.067 --> 03:58:36.669
TRY SOMETHING NEW OR THAT SON

03:58:36.735 --> 03:58:39.405
KNOWN AND ISN'T AS CLEAR AS

03:58:39.471 --> 03:58:42.341
PEOPLE WANTED TO BE- THAT THIRD

03:58:42.408 --> 03:58:44.109
THAT THERE ARE CONCERNS BUT I

03:58:44.176 --> 03:58:47.112
THINK. THE ASPIRATIONAL GOAL OF

03:58:47.179 --> 03:58:51.417
THIS 30% OF MANDATE IS A GOOD

03:58:51.483 --> 03:58:54.019
ONE- YOU KNOW I'VE I'VE HAD THE

03:58:54.086 --> 03:58:56.255
EXPERIENCES I HAPPEN TO HAVE. A

03:58:56.321 --> 03:58:57.623
FAMILY THAT COMES FROM NEW FROM

03:58:57.690 --> 03:59:00.793
LAND. AND SO WE VISITED THE NEW

03:59:00.859 --> 03:59:03.395
FEES- MANY YEARS AGO YOU KNOW

03:59:03.462 --> 03:59:04.630
NEW FROM LAND USED TO BE A

03:59:04.697 --> 03:59:08.434
ROBUST COD FISHING AREA- EACH

03:59:08.500 --> 03:59:11.036
EVERYWHERE YOU WENT THERE WAS

03:59:11.103 --> 03:59:13.505
CARD THIS CARD THA AND NOW THE

03:59:13.572 --> 03:59:15.374
COD FISHERMEN LEAST AS OF A FEW

03:59:15.441 --> 03:59:17.743
YEARS AGO WERE ALLOWED TO. TWO

03:59:17.810 --> 03:59:21.146
DAYS OF FISHING A YEAR AND A

03:59:21.213 --> 03:59:22.581
TOTAL OF I THINK FOR CARD.

03:59:22.648 --> 03:59:24.083
BECAUSE IT'S BEEN SO TERRIBLY

03:59:24.149 --> 03:59:26.118
OVER FISH THERE NO CARDS LEFT.

03:59:26.185 --> 03:59:27.820
NO PART OF IT FRANKLY WAS IT

03:59:27.886 --> 03:59:28.520
WAS OVERFISHED BY OTHER

03:59:28.587 --> 03:59:31.223
COUNTRIES. THAT HAD COME IN AND

03:59:31.290 --> 03:59:32.925
SO IT WOULD BE MY HOPE THAT

03:59:32.991 --> 03:59:34.560
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE WOULD

03:59:34.626 --> 03:59:37.062
CONSIDER. THAT ARE JURISDICTION

03:59:37.129 --> 03:59:40.866
ONLY GOES OUT THREE MILES AND

03:59:40.933 --> 03:59:42.234
YOU KNOW WE HAVE AS I

03:59:42.301 --> 03:59:43.902
UNDERSTAND IT A SUBSTANTIAL

03:59:43.969 --> 03:59:46.772
STOCK OF FISH AT THIS POINT

03:59:46.839 --> 03:59:47.439
TIME. BUT THAT CAN GO VERY

03:59:47.506 --> 03:59:50.409
QUICKLY AS I RECALL OUR FRIENDS

03:59:50.476 --> 03:59:53.912
IN NEWFOUNDLAND- EXPERIENCING

03:59:53.979 --> 03:59:55.214
THAT ALL NOW FRANKLY ON THEIR

03:59:55.280 --> 03:59:56.715
SOCIAL WELFARE PROGRAM BECAUSE

03:59:56.782 --> 03:59:59.084
THEY DON'T HAVE A LIVELIHOOD-

03:59:59.151 --> 04:00:00.085
AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THAT

04:00:00.152 --> 04:00:02.087
WE CERTAINLY DON'T WANT TO SEE.

04:00:02.154 --> 04:00:04.389
I GREW UP IN NEW ENGLAND MANY

04:00:04.456 --> 04:00:05.524
YEARS AGO THEY WERE LOOSE THERE

04:00:05.591 --> 04:00:07.726
WAS A AN ABSENCE OF LOBSTER

04:00:07.793 --> 04:00:11.563
STOCK. AND SO THEY LITERALLY

04:00:11.630 --> 04:00:13.165
CUT OFF LOBSTER FISHING. OR

04:00:13.232 --> 04:00:15.868
TRAPPING. FOR FIVE TO TEN YEARS

04:00:15.934 --> 04:00:17.436
AND NOW THEY HAVE A ROBUST

04:00:17.503 --> 04:00:20.806
STOCK SO MY SENSE IS THAT WE

04:00:20.873 --> 04:00:23.175
CAN DO THIS RIGHT. AND THAT IS

04:00:23.242 --> 04:00:26.178
IN ALL OF OUR BEST INTEREST TO

04:00:26.245 --> 04:00:27.646
DO IT RIGHT. SO WITH THAT- I AM

04:00:27.713 --> 04:00:29.348
GOING TO SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY

04:00:29.414 --> 04:00:29.948
BECAUSE I THINK IT'S A GOOD

04:00:30.015 --> 04:00:32.885
ASPIRATION- BUT I DO

04:00:32.951 --> 04:00:35.454
ANTICIPATE. AT THAT WE ARE NOT

04:00:35.521 --> 04:00:37.523
GOING TO BE RELINQUISHING OUR

04:00:37.589 --> 04:00:39.525
RESPONSIBILITIES AS A CO EQUAL

04:00:39.591 --> 04:00:41.360
BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT BECAUSE

04:00:41.426 --> 04:00:42.161
THESE ISSUES WILL COME BACK

04:00:42.227 --> 04:00:44.229
BEFORE US. BUT THE HOPE IS TO

04:00:44.296 --> 04:00:46.131
GET EVERYBODY AT THE TABLE AND

04:00:46.198 --> 04:00:47.766
FIGURE OUT HOW WE GET TO THAT

04:00:47.833 --> 04:00:49.701
THIRTY PERCENT. AND I THINK

04:00:49.768 --> 04:00:51.036
THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL ATTEMPTS

04:00:51.103 --> 04:00:53.906
TO DO. AND BECAUSE OF THAT I'M

04:00:53.972 --> 04:00:55.974
A WILLING TO SUPPORT IT TODAY

04:00:56.041 --> 04:00:58.377
THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR

04:00:58.443 --> 04:01:00.579
JACKSON. I JUST WANT TO OFFER A

04:01:00.646 --> 04:01:02.881
FEW COMMENTS AND THEN RETURN TO

04:01:02.948 --> 04:01:07.953
THE AUTHOR- FOR HIS CLOTHES.

04:01:08.020 --> 04:01:09.721
SEVERAL HAVE COMMENTED THAT

04:01:09.788 --> 04:01:11.690
WHAT'S THE NEXUS BETWEEN THIS

04:01:11.757 --> 04:01:14.426
IN COVERT NINETEEN I ACTUALLY

04:01:14.493 --> 04:01:15.761
SEE A VERY STRONG NEXUS WHEN WE
