00:45:20.117 --> 00:45:21.351
ADOPTED NEW ZEALAND- RULES FOR

00:45:21.418 --> 00:45:23.687
RESTORATION. THEN IN TWENTY

00:45:23.754 --> 00:45:24.488
TWENTY TWO FEBRUARY TWENTY

00:45:24.555 --> 00:45:25.856
TWENTY TWO- THE PC FINALLY

00:45:25.923 --> 00:45:28.025
ADOPTED. SIMILAR RESILIENCY

00:45:28.092 --> 00:45:29.893
REQUIREMENTS FOR WIRED

00:45:29.960 --> 00:45:31.428
COMMUNICATIONS IN ADDITION TO

00:45:31.495 --> 00:45:33.397
THAT WE MUST HAVE BACKUP POWER

00:45:33.464 --> 00:45:35.532
FOR SEVENTY TWO HOURS. TO MAKE

00:45:35.599 --> 00:45:36.200
SURE THOSE COMMUNICATIONS ARE UP

00:45:36.266 --> 00:45:38.001
AND RUNNING DURING- DISASTERS

00:45:38.068 --> 00:45:40.971
DURING PS PS. AND WHATNOT SO WE

00:45:41.038 --> 00:45:42.773
HAVE DONE A LOT NOW IT'S

00:45:42.840 --> 00:45:43.941
INTERESTING TO HEAR FOLKS SAY

00:45:44.007 --> 00:45:46.009
WELL. THAT THOSE RULES AND THAT

00:45:46.076 --> 00:45:48.412
LEGISLATION WAS TIED TO

00:45:48.479 --> 00:45:49.513
COMMUNICATIONS IT WASN'T TIED TO

00:45:49.580 --> 00:45:51.148
BROADBAND. SO THIS IS GOING TO

00:45:51.215 --> 00:45:52.483
BE A REAL SHOCK TO- COMMITTEE

00:45:52.549 --> 00:45:54.785
IT'S THE SAME NETWORK SO THAT

00:45:54.852 --> 00:45:56.587
WAY IF IT GOES OUT OF THE VOICE

00:45:56.653 --> 00:45:59.590
GOES OUT. ROBIN GOES OUT YOUR

SERVICE SO IT ALL GOES OUT IT IS

00:46:04.428 --> 00:46:06.296
THE SAME NETWORK IT IS MORE OR

00:46:06.363 --> 00:46:07.865
LESS THE SAME NETWORK THAT GOES

00:46:07.931 --> 00:46:09.666
OUT. SO WHAT THIS BILL DOES KNOW

00:46:09.733 --> 00:46:11.135
IT ASKS FOR DIFFERENT TYPE OF

00:46:11.201 --> 00:46:12.436

00:46:21.712 --> 00:46:23.013

00:46:23.080 --> 00:46:24.414
SORT OF PROPRIETARY INFORMATION

00:46:24.481 --> 00:46:25.282

THAT'S A DISTRACTION WE'RE

TRYING TO GET NETWORKS UP AND

OCCURRED. TO RATHER THAN ASSUME

00:47:56.340 --> 00:47:59.042

WE SHOULD CONFIRM THAT IT IS A

00:48:01.912 --> 00:48:03.280
MESS SO. UNTIL WE HAVE SOME

00:48:03.347 --> 00:48:05.682
SPECIFIC REASON WHY- WE WOULD

. ANY COMMENTS CONCERNS VICE

00:49:40.110 --> 00:49:42.012
CHAIR SIR TELL YOU HAVE A

00:49:42.079 --> 00:49:45.148
COMMENT QUESTION YES THEY DO- SO

00:49:45.215 --> 00:49:46.783
. YEAH I HAD PROBLEMS WITH THIS

00:49:46.850 --> 00:49:49.786
BEFORE AND IT SENT SOME OF IT

00:49:49.853 --> 00:49:50.954
WAS RELATED TO THE INFORMATION

00:49:51.021 --> 00:49:52.756
GOING OUT IMMEDIATELY AND YOU

00:49:52.823 --> 00:49:54.358
KIND OF ADDRESS THAT A LITTLE

00:49:54.424 --> 00:49:56.226
BIT HERE. BUT YOU KNOW THIS IS

00:49:56.293 --> 00:49:57.227
IT BEING THE EMERGENCY

00:49:57.294 --> 00:49:58.962
MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE WERE TRYING

00:49:59.029 --> 00:50:00.897
TO FOCUS ON THE EMERGENCY

00:50:00.964 --> 00:50:03.066
MANAGEMENT PART AND WE'RE KIND

00:50:03.133 --> 00:50:04.167
OF TALKING ABOUT TWO DIFFERENT

00:50:04.234 --> 00:50:06.436
THINGS ONE OF IS YOU KNOW WHAT

00:50:06.503 --> 00:50:11.475
DO WE DO IMMEDIATELY. TO GET-

00:50:11.541 --> 00:50:13.977
COMMUNICATIONS BACK UP. AND

00:50:14.044 --> 00:50:15.112
THAT'S SOMETHING WE ALWAYS DEAL

00:50:15.178 --> 00:50:17.013
WITH IN THE FIRE SERVICE- IT'S

00:50:17.080 --> 00:50:17.981
AND IT'S A CRITICAL

00:50:18.048 --> 00:50:19.449
COMMUNICATIONS IS THE MOST

00:50:19.516 --> 00:50:22.652
CRITICAL ELEMENT. AND SO THAT

00:50:22.719 --> 00:50:23.854
WHEN WE'RE DOING THAT PART OF

00:50:23.920 --> 00:50:29.960
IT- SPEED- IS WAY MORE IMPORTANT

00:50:30.026 --> 00:50:33.397
THAN- THE YOU KNOW THE LINE LOVE

00:50:33.463 --> 00:50:35.065
THE LONGER OUTLOOK. AND THEN

00:50:35.132 --> 00:50:36.133
THERE'S THE LONGER OUTLOOK AND I

00:50:36.199 --> 00:50:38.568
THINK THAT'S WHAT YOUR BILL IS

00:50:38.635 --> 00:50:40.637
TRYING TO ADDRESS- MAKE CALLAWAY

00:50:40.704 --> 00:50:43.073
ELSE DOES ALREADY COLLECT- THEY

00:50:43.140 --> 00:50:45.041
THEY'RE THE ONES WHO COORDINATE.

00:50:45.108 --> 00:50:47.511
ALL OF THE DOWNED POWER ALL THE

00:50:47.577 --> 00:50:48.845
OUTAGES AND ALL THOSE THINGS

00:50:48.912 --> 00:50:50.447
ALREADY AND IT JUST SEEMS

00:50:50.514 --> 00:50:52.382
DUPLICATIVE FROM EMERGENCY

00:50:52.449 --> 00:50:54.584
MANAGEMENT PART. TO BE TRYING TO

00:50:54.651 --> 00:50:58.221
DO THAT- I THINK IS ONE

00:50:58.288 --> 00:50:59.856
GENTLEMAN IT STATED. IT IT KIND

00:50:59.923 --> 00:51:01.291
OF MONIES UP WHAT YOU'RE

00:51:01.358 --> 00:51:02.492
SUPPOSED TO BE DOIG WHICH IS AS

00:51:02.559 --> 00:51:03.427
RAPIDLY AS POSSIBLE GETTING

00:51:03.493 --> 00:51:05.529
PEOPLE BACK TO COMMUNICATING.

00:51:05.595 --> 00:51:08.198
AND- AND- WHAT WHAT WE'RE

00:51:08.265 --> 00:51:10.434
TALKING ABOUT WITH THIS LONGER

00:51:10.500 --> 00:51:12.502
TERM IT SEEMS IS. THE

00:51:12.569 --> 00:51:15.872
OPPORTUNITY TO UPGRADE SYSTEMS.

00:51:15.939 --> 00:51:17.741
AND THAT'S THAT'S A DIFFERENT

00:51:17.808 --> 00:51:19.910
DISCUSSION BECAUSE THEN THAT

00:51:19.976 --> 00:51:21.945
BECOMES PART OF RATE PAYER

00:51:22.012 --> 00:51:24.147
ISSUES WHERE DOES THE STATE COME

00:51:24.214 --> 00:51:26.616
IN TO TRY TO HELP UPGRADE THOSE-

00:51:26.683 --> 00:51:28.618
THE- THOSE NAY COMMUNICATIONS

00:51:28.685 --> 00:51:31.188
SYSTEMS THEMSELVES- BUT DURING

00:51:31.254 --> 00:51:32.522
THE A MANAGE THE EMERGENCY

00:51:32.589 --> 00:51:34.791
MANAGEMENT PART OF IT. IT'S

00:51:34.858 --> 00:51:36.359
ABOUT THE MOBILE MOBILE

00:51:36.426 --> 00:51:38.028
COMMUNICATION TRACK SWITCHER OF

00:51:38.094 --> 00:51:40.864
KIND OF IN IT YOU KNOW THEY

00:51:40.931 --> 00:51:41.698
HAVE- ACCESSIBILITY LIMITED A

00:51:41.765 --> 00:51:44.367
LIMITS- AS THEY'RE TRYING TO

00:51:44.434 --> 00:51:46.069
POSITION THEMSELVES BUT THERE'S

00:51:46.136 --> 00:51:47.904
ALSO COMMUNICATIONS TOWERS THESE

00:51:47.971 --> 00:51:49.005
LITTLE MOBILE COMMUNICATIONS

00:51:49.072 --> 00:51:50.507
TOWERS. THEY CAN BE SET UP

00:51:50.574 --> 00:51:52.676
TEMPORARILY- AND THAT'S

00:51:52.742 --> 00:51:53.977
SOMETHING I THINK THE STATE ROLE

00:51:54.044 --> 00:51:55.745
BUT I SHOULD BE THAT'S SOMETHING

00:51:55.812 --> 00:51:57.080
WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT IT FROM

00:51:57.147 --> 00:51:58.415
