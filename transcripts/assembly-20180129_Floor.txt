ALL BUT UNFORTUNATELY BEEN WORKING ON THESE REGULATIONS FOR OVER TWO AND A HALF YEARS AND WE STILL DON'T KNOW EXACTLY. WHEN THEY'LL BE DONE. PROPOSALS VERY SIMPLE. WE ASK THAT AUTONOMOUS VEHICLE COMPANIES BEFORE THEY PUT THE VEHICLES ON THE ROAD. TELL LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT WHERE THE VEHICLES ARE GOING. HOW TO SHUT THAT DOWN BECAUSE IT WON'T HAVE HUMAN BEINGS IN THEM? AND ALSO THAT THEY DRAFT A PLAN WITH LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT WE BELIEVE THAT THIS IS GOOD PUBLIC POLICY. SOME PRACTICE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR STREETS ARE SAFE. AT ALL TIMES. THIS INCIDENT CAME ABOUT A COUPLE OF LAST YEAR. WHEN A COMPANY IN SAN FRANCISCO DECIDED TO PUT IN AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES ON THE ROAD PRIOR TO RECEIVING APPROVAL.

ASSEMBLY BILL TWELVE THIRTY ONE BY SOME THE MEMBER WEBER AND ACTUALLY THE PUBLIC POST SECONDARY EDUCATION. DOCTOR WEBER. YES MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS I'M HERE TO PRESENT YOU AB TWELVE THIRTY ONE. THE MERIT SALARY ADJUSTMENTS FOR THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY. EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT. ABOUT TO SEE IF SHE WAS THE ONLY CALIFORNIA STATE AGENCY THAT DOES NOT PROVIDE SALARY STEPS TO ITS STAFF. THIS CREATES AN INVERSION AND SALAS WHERE NEW HIRES ARE EARNING MORE THAN MORE EXPERIENCED EMPLOYEES. IN NINETEEN NINETY SIX THE CSU BOARD OF TRUSTEES UNILATERALLY ELIMINATED EXISTING EMPLOYEES DAHLE STEPS. INCREASING INCREASES TIED TO JOB PERFORMANCE AND LONGEVITY. THIS IS RESULTED IN NEW HIRES EARNING HIGHER SALARIES IN EXISTING EMPLOYEES WHO HAVE WORKED IN THE SAME CLASSIFICATION FOR MANY YEARS. THIS IN EQUITY HAS CREATED A NINETY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN VERSION GAP BETWEEN THE SAUDIS OF NEWLY HIRED AND LONG EMPLOYED SEE ISSUE STAFF. FOR TWO DECADES SEE ISSUE HAS BEEN WILL UNWILLING TO REINSTATE THE DAHLE STEPS DESPITE THE FAILURE OF THE EXISTING DAHLE STRUCTURE. AND THE INABILITY OF EMPLOYEES TO EARN A FAIR AND EQUITABLE WAIT. AB TWELVE THIRTY ONE WILL REINSTATE THE FIVE PERCENT DAHLE STEP WAS CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY SUPPORT STAFF NOW EMPHASIZE THAT THIS IS SUPPORT STAFF. BECAUSE THIS IS NOT FACULTY AND THOSE WHO BREAK THE GREATER SALAS WITH THOSE WHO ARE THE JANITORS THE CUSTODIANS OF THOSE WHO WORK AROUND THE UNIVERSITY. THIS INCREASE WILL BE MADE ANNUALLY WHEN EMPLOYEES MEET THE STANDARDS OF THIS IS A MERIT INCREASE AND NOT JUST AN AUTOMATIC INCREASE THAT EXIST. MEMBERS MAINTAINING A HIGH QUALITY C. ISSUE DEPENDS ON THE RETENTION OF EXPERIENCED EMPLOYEES INVESTED IN THE LONG TERM HEALTH AND GROWTH OF UNIVERSITY. THE CURRENT DAHLE STRUCTURE DOES NOT FACILITATE THIS AB TWELVE THIRTY ONE WOULD RETURN A POLICY WAS THE ISSUE STAFF TO PAY LIKE OTHER STATE EMPLOYEES AND SEE ISSUE MANAGEMENT. THE FIVE PERCENT INCREASE IS ON PAR WITH WHAT'S THE ISSUE STAFF USED TO GET BEFORE NINETEEN NINETY SIX AND IS IN LINE WITH WHAT OTHER STATE EMPLOYEES RECEIVE. AGAIN THESE PAY RAISES WOULD BE MERIT BASED AND NOT OUT OF MATIC AND THEY REQUIRE AN ASSESSMENT OF PERFORMANCE I RESPECTFULLY ASK ME I BOTH AB TWELVE THIRTY ONE. THANK YOU DOCTOR WEBER MISTER ALLEN YOU'RE RIGHT SHE OTHER. WITHOUT OBJECTION. CAN YOU NAME ONE PRIVATE COMPANY IN CALIFORNIA GIVES AUTOMATIC REYES OF FIVE PERCENT OF EMPLOYEES EVERY SINGLE YEAR JUST FOR SHOWING UP. I NEVER WORK IF A PRIVATE COMPANY BEFORE I'VE ALWAYS WORKED NONPROFITS A STATE INSTITUTION LIKE YOU VERY MUCH. ON MY OWN TIME ALL THIS IS THE PROBLEM WITH THE DAYS CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE WE HAVE A BILL BEING PROPOSED BY AN AUTHOR WHO HAS NEVER WORKED IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR. THE AUTHOR NOW WANTS TO GIVE THESE EMPLOYEES AN AUTOMATIC FIVE PERCENT RAISE EVERY SINGLE YEAR THAT THEY JUST SHOW UP FOR WORK. THIS IS THE PROBLEM IN CALIFORNIA TODAY THIS IS WHY OUR STATE BUDGET IS OUT OF CONTROL. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN THERE IS NO PRIVATE COMPANY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHERE YOU CAN GET AN AUTOMATIC FIVE PERCENT RAISE EVERY YEAR. IF THIS BILL PASSES I WOULD URGE EVERY SINGLE CALIFORNIA TO APPLY FOR THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM SO THEY CAN GET ONE OF THE ABSOLUTE BEST JOBS IN CALIFORNIA BECAUSE THESE JOBS SIMPLY DON'T EXIST IN THE REAL WORLD. THIS BILL HAS NO REAL THINKING IN IT AND IT IS AUTHORED BY SOMEONE WHO HAS NEVER WORKED IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR. I URGE NO VOTE. MS GONZALEZ FLETCHER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I RISE IN SUPPORT. OF THIS BILL. PERHAPS I'M WE COULD ALL READ THE BILL WHERE IT STATES THAT IT'S A MERIT BASED STEP. THAT MEANS YOU'RE EVALUATED BASED ON PERFORMANCE. I I I THINK THAT'S A GREAT IDEA AND ALTHOUGH I'M SURE. THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE WHO WOULD LIKE A JOB. WITH OUR CAL STATE SYSTEM IF YOU DO WANT TO BE A FOOD HANDLER A CUSTODIAN.

I DID WORK FOR A DAY DAY NEWBERRY'S ONCE WHEN I WAS IN COLLEGE I HAVE WORKED FOR PRIVATE ENTITIES. ENTITY BEFORE. AS POINTED OUT THIS IS THIS IS WHERE IT'S OUR INCREASE IN THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE WHEN YOU WORK AT A COMPANY AND YOU ARE STUCK IN A POSITION. AND YOU DON'T HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO MOVE UP BASED ON YOUR PERFORMANCE IN THIS IS MERIT BASIS IS NOT JUST AUTOMATIC THIS IS MERIT BASE. IT BECOMES REALLY DEMORALIZING FOR THOSE WHO WORK HERE. WHEN I FIRST WENT TO THE UNIVERSITY I'VE AYE AYE THEY HAD MERIT STEP INCREASES AMONG FACULTY. AND AS A RESULT AND ANALYSTS ALSO AMONG STAFF AND AS A RESULT OF THE VALUATION OF YOUR ADMINISTRATOR IN TERMS OF THE THINGS YOU DONE THERE WERE FIVE STEPS AT EVERY POSITION. AND YOU HAD A CHANCE TO EARN YOUR WAY TO WORK UP THAT LADDER TO A HIGHER PAY. AND THEREFORE WAS AN INCENTIVE FOR DOING THAT WHEN THEY TOOK THIS AWAY I WAS CHAIR OF THE DEPARTMENT. AND HERE I WAS EVERY YEAR EVALUATING MY STAFF EVALUATING MY ADMINISTRATIVE COORDINATOR WOULD KNOW THE NO OPPORTUNITY TO MOVE THE PERSON UP OR ANYWHERE ELSE WOULD JUST DOING THE VALUATION SETTING GOALS AND OBJECTIVES INVOICE AND EVALUATING WHERE THEY WERE MEETING THEM. AND THERE WAS NO INCENTIVE FOR THEM TO DO IT NOW THEY DID OFTENTIMES BECAUSE THEY PRIDED HIMSELF IN THE WORK THAT THEY DID. BUT THERE WAS NO INCENTIVE THAT WAS BUILT IN THIS IS WHAT GOOD COMPANIES DO IF YOU LOOK AT A COMPANY IS WHAT THE GOVERNMENT DOES IS WHAT ALL OF OUR AGENCIES DO. TO INCENTIVIZE OUR FOLKS TO WORK HARD TO KNOW THAT THERE IS MERIT ATTACHED TO IT THAT THEIR RAISES THAT COME BUT RAISES DON'T COME BECAUSE OF MAYOR THEY COME BECAUSE OF THE ECONOMIC TIMES BEING BETTER. AND MAYBE THE MARKET PLACES CHANGE OF THE JOB DESCRIPTION THE DEFINITIONS OF CHAINS AND THEREFORE THEY GIVE A THREE PERCENT EVERYBODY ACROSS THE BOARD BUT MERITED IT INCREASES THE STEPS ARE FOR MERIT. AND THAT'S IMPORTANT AND WE SHOULD NOT THE FACT THAT THIS IS THE ONE AGENCY THE STAFF MEMBERS THE CLASSIFIED MEMBERS OF THE C. ISSUE THAT DO NOT HAVE MERIT INCREASES AND WE SHOULD HAVE THE. THE THE DESIRE TO CREATE THE FAIRNESS AS WELL AS TO GIVE THEM THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK HARD AND US TO SAY THANK YOU BY HAVING AN INCREASE A STEP INCREASE WHEN THEY A BASICALLY ACCOMPLISH THEIR GOALS.

A CYNICAL SIX TWENTY SIX BY SOME A MEMBER EDUARDO GARCIA AND OTHERS IN EXPLAIN TO THE CALIFORNIA RETAIL FOOD CODE. MR GARCIA YOU'RE RECOGNIZED MEMBER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS. AS WE ENTER INTO THE NEW YEAR I'D LIKE YOU ALL TO REMEMBER THE HOLIDAY SEASON WE JUST CELEBRATED. THERE'S A CUSTOM IN MY DISTRICT AND PERHAPS IN MANY OF YOURS. WHERE YOU HAVE THE MONEY IS BEING SOLD IN AND AROUND THE NEIGHBORHOOD? AND OFTENTIMES WE REFER TO THE PERSON. AND MOST TIMES IT'S A. WOMAN AND WE FOR TOURISM AMALI LADY. DURING THE HOLIDAY SEASON. IN MY DISTRICT WERE OVER ONE QUARTER OF MY CONSTITUENTS ARE CURRENTLY UNEMPLOYED. THE HIGHEST RATE OF UNEMPLOYMENT THAN ANYWHERE ELSE IN CALIFORNIA. THE CELL OF HOMEMADE FOOD COULD PROVIDE MEANINGFUL INCOME. A COMMUNITIES LIKE MINE BUT ALSO IN MANY THE COMMUNITIES. LIKE YOURS. FAMILIES WHO CANNOT AFFORD CHRISTMAS PRESENTS A SCHOOL SUPPLIES OR ASKING ME WHY. THEY AREN'T ALLOWED TO SELL THEIR FOOD. KERN OPTIONS FOR SELLING FOOD OUR SEVERITY PROHIBITIVE. AND MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR MANY COOKS TO INDEPENDENT BENEFIT FROM THEIR LABOR AND SKILLS. AS A RESULT THOUSANDS. A POTENTIAL SMALL BUSINESS ENTREPRENEURS MISS OUT ON A CRITICAL INCOME OPPORTUNITY. OR CHOOSE TO OPERATE. UNDER THE TABLE WITHOUT THE BENEFIT OF SAFETY GUIDELINES OR OTHER RESOURCES TO PROTECT. THE PUBLIC HEALTH AND WELL BEING OF CALIFORNIANS. THAT IS WHY I AM HONORED TODAY TO STAND WITH MY CORE OUT THERE THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER FROM FRESNO. TO PRESENT EIGHT B. SIX TWENTY SIX THE HOMEMADE FOOD OPERATIONS AT. THE GOAL OF THIS BILL IS TO PROMOTE ECONOMIC EMPOWERMENT. PARTICULARLY IN OUR MOST FORMAL COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE. WHERE THE CELL OF HOMEMADE FOOD IS ALREADY INCREDIBLY? POPULAR. I'D LIKE TO CLEAR UP TO BIG MISCONCEPTIONS ABOUT THIS BILL. A. B. SIX TWO SIX IS AN OPT IN PROGRAM THAT WILL ONLY BE ALLOWED IN COUNTIES. THAT DECIDE THAT THIS IS AN ACTIVITY. APPROPRIATE FOR THEM. IF YOU ARE CONCERNED THAT A COUNTY YOUR DISTRICT OPPOSES IT. IT'S OKAY. THEY ARE NOT REQUIRED. TO ADOPT THIS PERMIT. IF THEY CHOOSE NOT TO. THE HEALTH OFFICERS AT EACH COUNTY. ARE RELATED TO BUT DIFFERENT THEN THE ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS. WHO ARE THE STAFF RESPONSIBLE FOR PERMITTING FOOD FACILITIES? AB SIX TWO SIX INCLUDES EVERY AMENDMENT OFFERED BY THE ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH REGULATORS WHICH WERE CLOSE TO TWELVE. AMENDMENTS P. EXPERTS. SOME OF WHOM RECOGNIZE THAT ENFORCEMENT TO TRY TO STAMP OUT THIS ACTIVITY. ONLY HURTS COMMUNITIES. BUT THEY STILL CANNOT SUPPORT THE BILL BECAUSE OF THEIR POLITICAL RELATIONSHIP WITH THE HELP OFFICERS AND COUNTIES. COUNTIES THAT ADOPT AB SIX TWO SIX WILL CREATE A PERMIT PROCESS THAT WILL REQUIRE INSPECTIONS. SAFE FOOD HANDLING TRAINING AND OTHER SAFETY AND PUBLIC HEALTH PRECAUTIONS. THIS IS AN ADDITION TO THE STATISTICS THAT SHOW THAT RATES OF FOOD BORNE ILLNESS IN HOME SETTINGS ARE A FRACTION OF THE RATE OF ILLNESSES WE SEE. IN COMMERCIAL SETTINGS. FURTHER THIS BILL LIMITS THE CELL. THE SCALE AND SALES TO ENSURE IT IS A STEPPING STONE TOWARD AND NOT. A REPLACEMENT UP THE USE OF COMMERCIAL KITCHEN SPACES WHEN APPROPRIATE AND AVAILABLE TO CUTS. IN SOME. AB SIX TO SIX IS LONG OVERDUE. ADJUSTMENT TO OUR CODE THAT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO HAVE A BIG IMPACT ON THE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. OF THE VERY COMMUNITIES THAT NEED IT THE MOST. THE BILL HAS RECEIVED STRONG BIPARTISAN SUPPORT AND NO NO VOTES I URGE YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER ARAMBULA. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER AND MEMBERS. I AM PROUD TO STAND IS A CO AUTHOR OF AB SIX TWENTY SIX. THIS BILL IS A POWERFUL ECONOMIC TOOL TO HELP HOME COOKS LEGALLY SELL FOOD FROM THEIR HOME KITCHENS. THIS BILL WILL PERMIT THE SALES OF HOMEMADE FOODS AND PROVIDE SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS WITH THE LEGAL AND SAFE PROCESS THROUGH WHICH TO RUN THEIR MICROENTERPRISE. CONSUMERS AND ENTREPRENEURS ALIKE WILL BENEFIT FROM THE PUBLIC HEALTH REPORTING SYSTEM. DELINEATED IN THIS BILL WHICH WILL HELP TO ENSURE THAT THE KITCHENS ARE INSPECTED AND FOLLOWED PROPER PUBLIC HEALTH PROTOCOLS. ENGENDERING CONFIDENCE IN THE COOKS AND SATISFIED CONSUMERS. IN AREAS SUCH LIKE FRESNO THIS BILL WILL ALLOW INDIVIDUALS IN REMOTE AND RURAL REGIONS TO USE THEIR SKILLS AND TALENTS. TO LEGALLY SELL FOOD FROM THEIR HOMES HELPING STAY AT HOME PARENTS IMMIGRANTS FARMERS AND TALENTED COOKS FROM ALL WALKS OF LIFE. SO HOMEMADE FOOD AS A MEANS FOR EXPORT ECONOMIC UPWARD MOBILITY. I WANTED TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR THIS BILL I KNOW HE AND I BOTH HAVE NOT MISSED TOO MANY HOMEMADE THE MULLIS. BUT WE MUST LOOK TO THE FACT THAT THIS PERMITTING PROCESS IN AB SIX TWENTY SIX WILL INCREASE THE CONFIDENCE OF THE ENTREPRENEURS AND THE CONSUMERS. HELPING SET THEM ON A TRACK OF SUCCESS. I HOPE YOU'LL JOIN ME TODAY INSUPPORTING THE HOMEMADE FOOD OPERATIONS ACT I URGE YOUR AYE VOTE. ASSEMBLY MEMBER GARCIA WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE OR ACCEPT THAT AS YOUR CLOTHES. COLLEAGUES SEVERAL YEARS AGO THERE WAS A DEBATE. WITH REGARD TO THE FOOT TRUCKS THAT WE SEE IN AND AROUND THE CAPITAL AND PERHAPS IN YOUR DISTRICTS WHERE WE SEE. FOOD TRUCK FESTIVALS AND THERE WAS A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF PUSH BACK. THAT YOU KNOW THEY COULD BE HARMFUL HURTFUL TO THE PUBLIC CAL. AND WELL BEING OF YOU KNOW THOSE WHO WOULD PATRONIZE THESE PARTICULAR FOOD TRUCKS AND. AND AND I THINK THAT'S BEEN NO DEMYSTIFY.

NEXT DOOR WHERE SHE WAS ARRESTED FOR SELLING SEMICHA. AND PROSECUTED BY THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY. NOW I MEAN I THINK THAT WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE IS VERY PRAGMATIC IN. COMMONSENSE APPROACH TO MAKING SURE THAT ALL OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH REGULATIONS AND INSPECTIONS ARE PLACE. IN ORDER TO AGAIN. ESTABLISH THESE MICRO ENTERPRISES IN OUR COMMUNITIES PROTECT THE PUBLIC HEALTH AND ONCE AGAIN DECRIMINALIZE SOMETHING THAT HAPPENS ALREADY IN OUR COMMUNITIES I RESPECTFULLY ASK ARRIVAL.

ONE ONCE VICTIMS HAVE ESCAPED THEY MUST CONFRONT THE REALITIES OF NEEDING HOUSING BASIC DAILY NECESSITIES AND TREATMENT FOR MEDICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES.

THE HUMAN TRAFFICKING VICTIM WHOSE PROMISED WAGES WERE NEVER RECEIVED WHILE THEY LABORED AND WAS DEPRIVED OPPORTUNITY TO EARN LEGAL WAGES CANNOT CURRENTLY BE COMPENSATED FOR LOST INCOME. THE WAY CURRENT REGULATIONS ARE WRITTEN SIMPLY DO NOT ACKNOWLEDGE THIS KIND OF CIRCUMSTANCE FOR COMPENSATION.
