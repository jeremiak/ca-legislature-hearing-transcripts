ASSEMBLY MEMBER WELCOME TO AGRICULTURE COMMITTEE. AND YOU MAY BEGIN WHEN YOU ARE READY. OTHER MEMBERS THANK YOU. TODAY ON AB TWENTY ONE FIFTY THREE. AB TWENTY ONE FIFTY THREE STRETCHES THE DOLLAR OF CALFRESH RECIPIENTS EVEN FURTHER BY COMBINING SUCCESSFUL FRUIT AND VEGETABLE SUPPLEMENTAL BENEFIT PROGRAMS WITH THE EFFICIENCIES OF CALIFORNIA'S EBT SYSTEM. CALIFORNIANS ARE FACING FOOD INSECURITY AT ALARMING RATES AT THE START OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO ONE IN TEN CALIFORNIANS WERE HAVING DIFFICULTY PUTTING FOOD ON THE TABLE. IT IS EVEN MORE DIFFICULT FOR LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS WITH ONE IN FOUR WHO ARE HAVING DIFFICULTIES WITH AFFORDABLE FRUITS AND VEGETABLES. THE RESEARCH SHOWS THAT WE CAN CHANGE THIS WHEN PEOPLE HAVE THE MONEY TO PURCHASE FRUITS AND VEGETABLES THEY DO. A NUMBER OF PROGRAMS AROUND THE STATE'S CURRENTLY PROVIDE DOLLAR FOR DOLLAR MATCH TO CALFRESH RECIPIENTS ASSEMBLYMEMBERS I COULD ASK YOU TO STOP HAVING SOME TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES AND WE NEED TO. TAKE A RECESS FOR ABOUT FIVE MINUTES. WHAT WE KNOW. AND HOLDING OUT THAT LONG. RIDLEY MY HAMBURGER. TO SEE- OKAY MAYBE SEVEN OTHER. OKAY OKAY ASSEMBLY MEMBER START. WHEN YOU ARE READY THANK YOU. AS WE STATED A NUMBER OF PROGRAMS AROUND THE STATE CURRENTLY PROVIDE DOLLAR FOR DOLLAR MATCH TO CALIFORNIA'S RECIPIENTS AT FARMERS MARKETS. AB TWENTY ONE FIFTY THREE RECOGNIZES THE IMMENSE POTENTIAL BENEFITS OF THESE MATCHING PROGRAMS AND MEETS CALFRESH RECIPIENTS WHERE THEY NORMALLY PURCHASE PRODUCE. THE EXPANSION WHICH IS PROPOSED WITHIN AB TWENTY ONE FIFTY THREE WOULD INCLUDE LARGE RETAIL CHAINS CORNER STORES AND OTHER DIRECT FARM TO CONSUMER ENTITIES THAT SELL CALIFORNIA GROWN FRUITS AND VEGETABLES. IMPORTANTLY THIS BILL LEVERAGES THE EFFICIENCY OF THE ET CARDS ALREADY USED BY CALFRESH RECIPIENTS TO REDUCE THE HASSLE AND TO MAKE ACCESSING FRUITS AND VEGETABLES THAT MUCH EASIER FOR FAMILIES ACROSS CALIFORNIA. I AM JOINED TODAY BY TAYLOR ROSHEN REPRESENTING THE FARM BUREAU AND BY DAVID BARBER DONE I'M A PARTICIPANT IN THE MAS FRESCO PROGRAM IN SAN DIEGO STRUCTURE WAS GREAT TO SEE YOU HI GOOD AFTERNOON- CHEN MEMBERS TO THE RUSSIAN THE CALIFORNIA FARM BUREAU WE HEAR IN SUPPORT OF TWENTY AND FIFTY THREE AND THANK DR ARAMBULA AND THE SPONSORS FOR THEIR WORK ON THIS- AS THE SOME MEMBER NOTED THE HEALTH BENEFITS THIS BILL- ARE OBVIOUS. MAKING HEALTHY FOOD MORE AFFORDABLE FOR ANY POPULATION BUT PARTICULARLY FOOD INSECURE I WILL HAVE DEMONSTRABLE HEALTH BENEFITS IT DOES THIS BY BUILDING ON THE EXISTING PILOT PROGRAM TO PURCHASE TO IMPROVE THE PURCHASING POWER. OF THAT BENEFIT RECIPIENTS AT A BROTHER SPOKE A SWATH OF RETAILERS AS MEMBER NOTED WE'VE GOT SOME GREAT SUCCESS HAPPENING AT CERTIFIED FARMERS MARKETS AND IT'S NOW TIME TO TRANSITION THEM TO LARGER RETAIL WHERE PEOPLE- ACTUALLY ARE PURCHASING THEIR FRESH FRUITS AND VEGETABLES- I'M SURE YOU'VE ALL SEEN IT AT YOUR OWN SUPERMARKET SHELVES INFLATION'S HIT A ALL TIME HIGH OF FORTY YEAR RECORD HIGH. AND USD JUST REPORTED- A FEW DAYS AGO THAT THE COST FOR FOOD TODAY IS 10% HIGHER THAN THE COST WAS LAST YEAR AT THE SAME TIME- SO UNFORTUNATELY WHAT THAT MEANS IS- MANY OF ARE FOOD INSECURE FAMILIES ARE TRYING TO STRETCH THEIR DOLLARS FURTHER. AND HAVE TO MAKE SOME TOUGH CHOICES ABOUT WHAT THEY BUY WHEN THEY EAT AND HOW MUCH THEY EATEN OFTENTIMES THAT MEANS THEY'RE NOT BUYING- FRESHFRUITS AND VEGETABLES ESPECIALLY NOT CALIFORNIA GROUND SO WHAT WE FEEL LIKE THIS BILL DOES IS IT REALLY SEEKS TO MAKE THAT CHOICE A LITTLE EASIER- AND IT'S REALLY A WIN FOR THOSE COMMUNITIES AND A WIN FOR THE FARMERS I'M IN CALIFORNIA THAT SELL INTO THOSE MARKETS SO. IN DOING THAT WE THINK WE EMPOWER ALL PARTS OF THE COMMUNITY AND WE'RE VERY SUPPORTIVE WE REQUESTED AYE VOTE. THANK YOU.

THE ORGANIC TRANSITION PROGRAM WILL SUPPORT FARMERS AS THEY TRANSITION TO ORGANIC FARMING BY FOCUSING ON LIMITED RESOURCE AND SOCIALLY DISADVANTAGED PRODUCERS AND PROVIDING FINANCIAL AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO BECOME CERTIFIED ORGANIC. UNDERSERVED FARMERS FACE BARRIERS THAT LIMIT THEIR ACCESS TO ORGANIC CERTIFICATION AND MARKETS THESE PRODUCED OFTEN MANAGE THEIR BUSINESS ON THINNER MARGINS THAT PREVENT THEM FROM ASSUMING ADDITIONAL RISK AB TWENTY FOUR NINE NINE TWENTY FOUR NINETY NINE SEEKS TO ADDRESS THESE CHALLENGES TO KEEP FARMERS IN BUSINESS. I APPRECIATE THE THOUGHTFUL ENGAGEMENT FROM THE FARM BUREAU AND THE FOR TO CONTINUE DISCUSSIONS AS THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT AS REBEKAH WEBER MARIE NORRIS.

THIS IS YOUR FOUNDATION RUNS THE GRANT PROGRAM TO PROVIDE ASSISTANCE TO FARMERS THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES TO TRANSITION TO ORGANIC AND MANY OF THE LEARNINGS FROM THE SUCCESSFUL GRANT PROGRAM ARE BAKED INTO TWENTY FOUR NINETY NINE. I ASKED THE COMMITTEE TO SUPPORT AB TWENTY FOUR NINETY NINE THIS BILL IS AIMED AT THE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. OF SOCIALLY DISADVANTAGED AND LIMITED RESOURCE FARMERS AND RANCHERS. IT EXPANDS ON EXISTING EQUITY PROGRAMS THAT CDFA. BY PROVIDING FINANCIAL AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO UNDERSERVED FARMERS AND RANCHERS TO TRANSITION TO ORGANIC. CDFA IS TWENTY TWENTY FORMER EQUITY ACT REPORT HIGHLIGHTS THAT SOCIALLY DISADVANTAGED FARMERS AND RANCHERS NEED GREATER ACCESS TO RESOURCES. AB TWENTY FOUR NINETY NINE SEEKS TO FILL THIS GAP BY PROVIDING FINANCIAL AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO TRANSITION TO ORGANIC. ORGANIC SO FARMERS- EXCUSE ME. ORGANIC ED IS A UNIQUE LABEL THAT GUARANTEES THAT FOOD IS RAISED AND GROWN USING ECOLOGICAL PRACTICES ORGANIC FARMERS AND RANCHERS ARE REQUIRED TO CONSERVE SOIL WATER WETLANDS WOODLANDS AND WILDLIFE. ORGANIC CERTIFICATE HELPS FARMERS TO STAY IN BUSINESS BY PROVIDING MARKET OPPORTUNITY AS WELL AS BEING ALIGNED WITH ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS. WE HAVE HEARD FROM UNDERSERVED FARMERS WHO WOULD LIKE TO BE CERTIFIED ORGANIC BUT THAT THE TRANSITION PERIOD IS TOO ONEROUS. HEAVING ORGANIC CERTIFICATION IS NOT EASY FARMERS CANNOT APPLY PROHIBITED SYNTHETIC PESTICIDES AND FERTILIZERS TO THE LAND FOR THREE YEARS PRIOR TO TEIR FIRST ORGANIC HARVEST. FARMERS MUST MAKE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS INCLUDING SEED AND FEED LABOR INFRASTRUCTURE. PREVENTATIVE HEALTH CARE PRACTICES AND ECOLOGICAL MANAGEMENT OF PESTS WEEDS AND DISEASES. AB TWENTY FOUR NINETY NINE CREATES A PILOT ORGANIC TRANSITION PROGRAM. TO ENSURE THAT SOCIALLY DISADVANTAGED AND LIMITED RESOURCE FARMERS HAVE EQUAL ACCESS TO ORGANIC CERTIFICATION WIDE MARKET ANALYSIS OF YOUR CAN EXPECT- WE KNOW FARMERS NEED A CLEAR PICTURE. OF THE NEEDS AND OPPORTUNITIES OF THE MARKET PLACE FOR THEIR PRODUCTION PLANS AS WELL AS FOR PROVING THE FEASIBILITY OF THEIR BUSINESS PLANS AND EXPANSION STRATEGIES TO LENDERS.

OR PLEASE ENTER THE COME IS ON PROBATE- ONLY. ONCE IN COMMENTS- FOR- THOSE IN SUPPORT OF ASSEMBLY BILL TWO FOUR NINE NINE. NEXT CALL PLEASE WE HAVE NO FURTHER LINES AT THIS TIME THANK YOU STOP WRITERS AT THIS TIME WILL TAKE ANY- COMMENTS THAT HAVE CONCERN OPPOSITION TO SEND THE BILL TO FOUR NINE NINE. NOW TO THE TIME TO MAKE THOSE COMMENTS. OR. REMEMBER STILL RUSSIAN WITH THE CALVARY FROM THERE WERE A BIT OF A TWEENER HERE WE SUBMITTED A LETTER OF CONCERN FOR THE RECORD- I WANNA BE CLEAR WERE VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THE THEORY IF A FARMER WANTS TO MAKE A DECISION TO TRANSITION TO ORGANIC WE WANT TO BE SUPPORTIVE OF IT BECAUSE FOR EXACTLY THE REASONS THE WITNESSES MENTIONED IT'S TOUGH TO BE ORGANIC. I'M SORRY ONE OF PROVIDE THAT SUPPORT WHERE WE CAN AND I THINK THE STATE CAN PLAY AN ACTIVE ROLE IN THAT. THE CONCERN IS REALLY TWO FOLD ONE ON PROGRAMMATIC FUNCTIONS OR ADMINISTRATION OF THE PROGRAM. AND THE SECOND IS ON PRESIDENT- TWENTY FOUR NINETY NINE PROPOSES TO PLACE THE PROGRAM FOR TRANSITION TO ORGANIC IN THE FORMER EQUITY OFFICE OR WITH THE FARMER EQUITY ADVISER- UNDERSTANDABLY. THAT MIGHT BE THE FIRST POINT OF CONTACT FOR SOCIALLY DISADVANTAGED FARMERS AND RANCHERS BUT WE DO FEEL AS THOUGH IT HAS A BETTER HOME AND EITHER THE STATE ORGANIC PROGRAM- WHERE IT RELLY COVERS THE PANOPLY OF OPTIONS AROUND ORGANIC CERTIFICATION REGISTRATIONS. OR THE OFFICE OF ENVIRONMENTAL FARMING INNOVATION WHICH THIS LEGISLATURE JUST GAVE SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS TO LAST YEAR TO TRANSITION TO ORGANIC. I AND SO WE FEEL AS THOUGH. THOSE TWO PLACES ARE BUT- FOR PROGRAM LIKE THIS WITH. INCOMES WITH THE EQUITY OFFICER. RATHER CONCERN IS ONE OF PRESIDENT- WINS AGUIAR-CURRY PASSED THE FARM EQUITY ACT IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN. OUR UNDERSTANDING WAS THAT THE AT THE OFFICE WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR EMBEDDING THE PRINCIPLES OF DIVERSITY EQUITY INCLUSION AT THE PROGRAMMATIC GRASSROOTS LEVEL. THAT WE EACH PROGRAMS EQUITY COMPONENTS TAKEN TO IT- WITH THAT'S APTLY HAPPEN IT'S HARD WORK. TENSION ALL WORK- ARE CONCERNED. EIGHTY NINE. BUT IT MIGHT THE MESSAGE. ABSOLUTELY ON AND- THE- THE EITHER THAT COULD BE THE WORK ISN'T BEING TAKEN SERIOUSLY AND ISN'T BEING DONE IN EARNEST. OR THAT IF IS THERE IS A BENCH FARMER A RANCHER HAS A CHALLENGE WITH THE FARMER FACING PROGRAM AT THE GOVERNMENT ALLOWED LEVEL. THEIR ONLY RECOURSE IS TO NOT ADDRESS THE PROGRAM IN QUESTION BUT TO GO TO THE FORMER EQUITY POSITION AND RE CREATE A NEW PROGRAM. THAT SERVES THEM THERE. I THINK OUR PERSPECTIVE AT FARM BUREAU IS THAT EVERYONE DESERVES A SEAT AT THE TABLE. AND THE TABLE NOT BIG ENOUGH YOU DON'T BUILD A NEW TABLE FOR SOMEBODY ELSE. YOU MAKE THE TABLE BIGGER YOU SCOOCH DOWN TO MAKE ROOM. SO I THINK OUR CONCERN IS THAT- THE PROGRAM IS REALLY. ILL PLACE TO REALLY SERVICE THE FULL SUITE OF NEEDS THAT AN ORGANIC PRODUCER OR SH ONE DAVE ORGANIC PRODUCER WOULD REALLY NEED SO- CONCERNED WE'VE BEEN WORKING IN EARNEST WITH THE AUTHOR IN THE SPONSORS OF THEY'VE BEEN INCREDIBLY% GENEROUS WITH THEIR TIME. SO WE HOPE TO FIND A PATHWAY FORWARD. THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR THOSE COMMENTS- AT THIS TIME THERE ANY OTHER. MEMBERS IN THIS ROOM. WAS BRIGHT COMMENTS. SEEN ON THE SHOP RIGHT ARE THERE ANY CALLERS IN THE QUEUE. FOR COMMENTS IN OPPOSITION. TO ASSEMBLY BILL TWO FOUR NINE NINE. CLEVELAND THIS IN OPPOSITION PLEASE PRESS ONE THEN ZERO AT THIS TIME.
