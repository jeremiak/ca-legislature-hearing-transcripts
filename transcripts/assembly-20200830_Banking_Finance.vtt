ALSO HERE SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF

00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:23.315
NEARLY TWENTY EIGHTEEN AMERICAN

00:21:25.617 --> 00:21:26.118
SUPPORTING EIGHTY NINE SEVEN

00:21:26.184 --> 00:21:29.454
NOT. I COME FROM SILICON VALLEY

00:21:29.521 --> 00:21:30.288
WHERE WERE FOR THIRTY FIVE

00:21:30.355 --> 00:21:32.357
YEARS. BEFORE RETIRING AS A

00:21:32.424 --> 00:21:33.592
VICE PRESIDENT AT CISCO

00:21:33.659 --> 00:21:35.927
SYSTEMS. SINCE THEN I'VE SPENT

00:21:35.994 --> 00:21:37.362
MUCH OF MY TIME RESEARCHING THE

00:21:37.429 --> 00:21:39.097
CORPORATE GLASS CEILING FOR

00:21:39.164 --> 00:21:41.900
MINORITY MEN AND MINORITY WOMEN.

00:21:41.967 --> 00:21:43.568
MY RESEARCH HAS FOUND THAT IN

00:21:43.635 --> 00:21:44.736
THE LAST DECADE THEY'VE BEEN

00:21:44.803 --> 00:21:46.738
VERY LITTLE PROGRESS HAD BEEN

00:21:46.805 --> 00:21:48.707
MADE TO DIVERSIFY THE HIGHER

00:21:48.774 --> 00:21:49.474
LEVELS OF LEADERSHIP IN THE

00:21:49.541 --> 00:21:52.377
PAST. DESPITE BEST EFFORTS OF

00:21:52.444 --> 00:21:54.546
THE CORPORATE SECTOR. MY REVIEW

00:21:54.613 --> 00:21:57.049
OF UC DATING CALIFORNIA SHOWS

00:21:57.115 --> 00:21:59.151
THAT WHITE MEN AND WOMEN ARE

00:21:59.217 --> 00:22:01.253
NOW ONLY 46% OBSTRUCTION

00:22:01.319 --> 00:22:03.689
WORKFORCE BUT STILL REPRESENTS

00:22:03.755 --> 00:22:05.857
71% OF ALL EXECUTIVES IN TWENTY

00:22:05.924 --> 00:22:08.326
P. SO THE DATE IS CLEAR.

00:22:08.393 --> 00:22:10.262
EXISTING STRATEGIES TO

00:22:10.328 --> 00:22:12.464
DIVERSIFY HAVE FAILED. THAT'S

00:22:12.531 --> 00:22:13.331
WHY IT'S TIME FOR A NEW

00:22:13.398 --> 00:22:14.700
APPROACH TO CELEBRATE

00:22:14.766 --> 00:22:15.867
LEADERSHIP TO ENGAGE AT THE

00:22:15.934 --> 00:22:17.769
HIGHEST LEVELS IT'S PRIVATE

00:22:17.836 --> 00:22:19.404
CALIFORNIA REQUIRES SEATS IN

00:22:19.471 --> 00:22:22.574
THE BOARDROOM OR IT'S UNDER

00:22:22.641 --> 00:22:24.109
REPRESENTED COMMUNITIES.

00:22:24.176 --> 00:22:26.178
MEETINGS REPRESENT 67% OF

00:22:26.244 --> 00:22:28.814
CALIFORNIA POPULATION. BUT HOLD

00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:31.216
ONLY 14% OF FORTUNE ONE

00:22:31.283 --> 00:22:31.717
THOUSAND BOARD SEATS IN

00:22:31.783 --> 00:22:34.619
CALIFORNIA. MY ANALYSIS FOUND

00:22:34.686 --> 00:22:36.621
THAT EIGHTY NINE THIRTY NINE

00:22:36.688 --> 00:22:38.323
WILL DOUBLE THAT NUMBER. IT HAD

00:22:38.390 --> 00:22:39.791
A HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE MINORITY

00:22:39.858 --> 00:22:41.960
BOARD MEMBERS TO FORTY ONE

00:22:42.027 --> 00:22:44.229
THOUSAND BOARDS. NOW SOME WORRY

00:22:44.296 --> 00:22:45.831
THAT FINDING QUALIFIED MINORITY

00:22:45.897 --> 00:22:47.766
RECORDS WOULD BE HARD. BUT I

00:22:47.833 --> 00:22:49.401
REFUSE TO BELIEVE IT CAN'T FIND

00:22:49.468 --> 00:22:50.936
A HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE HIGHLY

00:22:51.002 --> 00:22:54.606
QUALIFIED AND IT'S ON THE

00:22:54.673 --> 00:22:55.107
TWENTY THOUSAND MINORITY

00:22:55.173 --> 00:22:56.274
EXECUTIVES IN CALIFORNIA. AND

00:22:56.341 --> 00:22:57.776
IT SHOULD ONLY BE 28% OF

00:22:57.843 --> 00:22:59.578
CALIFORNIA FORTY ONE THOUSAND

00:22:59.644 --> 00:23:01.747
GOLD SEATS. WE DO NOT THINK

00:23:01.813 --> 00:23:03.982
THAT 22% 20% IS TOO MUCH TO

00:23:04.049 --> 00:23:06.118
ASK- CORPORATE LEADERS TO

00:23:06.184 --> 00:23:08.286
BETTER REPRESENT 67% OF ALL

00:23:08.353 --> 00:23:09.588
CALIFORNIANS IN

00:23:09.654 --> 00:23:11.356
UNDERREPRESENTED COMMUNITIES.

A PART OF AND AM VERY

00:32:10.628 --> 00:32:12.363
INTERESTED IN. BUT WE CANNOT

00:32:12.430 --> 00:32:13.831
UNDERSCORE ENOUGH THE ROLE THAT

ARE CHAIR HAS PLAYED IN GETTING

00:32:16.167 --> 00:32:20.004
US TO THIS POINT. AND FROM MY

00:32:20.071 --> 00:32:21.906
VIEW I'M NOT SURE GOES FAR

00:32:21.973 --> 00:32:23.708
ENOUGH I'M NOT SURE THAT THAT

00:32:23.775 --> 00:32:26.177
YOU NECESSARILY CREATES THE

00:32:26.244 --> 00:32:27.345
ENVIRONMENT THAT WE WOULD HAVE

00:32:27.412 --> 00:32:29.247
HOPED AND I KNOW THAT THE WHAT

00:32:29.314 --> 00:32:31.015
THE CHAIR HAD SET UP BUT

00:32:31.082 --> 00:32:31.916
SOMETIMES WE HAVE TO TAKE A

00:32:31.983 --> 00:32:34.218
BOLD STEP IN A STEP THAT IS

00:32:34.285 --> 00:32:34.819
BEFORE US AND THAT'S WHAT'S

00:32:34.886 --> 00:32:37.055
BEFORE US TODAY IT IS A

00:32:37.121 --> 00:32:38.723
COLLECTION OF A LOT OF TIME AND

00:32:38.790 --> 00:32:41.392
EFFORT TO NEGOTIATE SOMETHING

00:32:41.459 --> 00:32:43.961
REALLY TRULY SUBSTANTIAL. SO

00:32:44.028 --> 00:32:45.363
THE CHANGE THE ADMINISTRATION

00:32:45.430 --> 00:32:46.898
BACK IN JANUARY INTRODUCED A

00:32:46.964 --> 00:32:48.166
PROPOSED BUDGET TRAILER

00:32:48.232 --> 00:32:49.067
LANGUAGE AND IT'S GONE THROUGH

00:32:49.133 --> 00:32:50.802
MULTIPLE ITERATIONS. AND

00:32:50.868 --> 00:32:52.036
FORTUNATELY IT'S GONE THROUGH

00:32:52.103 --> 00:32:54.138
THOSE ITERATIONS. UNDER THAT

00:32:54.205 --> 00:32:56.607
THE GUIDANCE OF THIS COMMITTEE

00:32:56.674 --> 00:32:58.810

CERTAINLY IT'S CHAIR WHO PLAYED

00:33:00.244 --> 00:33:02.914
A VERY STRONG ROLE IN THIS. AND

00:33:02.980 --> 00:33:05.316
WHAT THIS REALLY DOES NOW. IS

00:33:05.383 --> 00:33:07.418
GIVE DEPARTMENT BUSINESS

00:33:07.485 --> 00:33:09.320
OVERSIGHT SOME REAL TOOLS TO BE

00:33:09.387 --> 00:33:14.792
ABLE TO ADDRESS THAT. THE LACK

00:33:14.859 --> 00:33:15.293
OF CONSUMER PROTECTION.

00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:17.929
FINANCIAL PROTECTION THERE ARE

00:33:17.995 --> 00:33:19.764
FORTY. IS THEY DIDN'T DO IT

00:33:19.831 --> 00:33:20.765
BECAUSE OF SOME CONCERNS THAT

00:33:20.832 --> 00:33:21.833
HAVE BEEN RAISED AND THEN

00:33:21.899 --> 00:33:23.568
RAISED BY MEMBERS OF THIS HOUSE

00:33:23.634 --> 00:33:25.036
THE AMENDMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN

00:33:25.103 --> 00:33:26.804
TAKEN AS WE'RE MOVING FORWARD

00:33:26.871 --> 00:33:29.107

WE LEARN AND AS WE SEE WHAT DVO

00:33:41.052 --> 00:33:43.221
DOES THAT WILL BUILD THAT

00:33:43.287 --> 00:33:44.455
RELATIONSHIP AND THAT TRUST SO

00:33:44.522 --> 00:33:46.257
THAT WE CAN DO OVERSIGHT. BUT

00:33:46.324 --> 00:33:48.025
WE ALSO ARE NOT GOING TO BE

00:33:48.092 --> 00:33:50.194

ENFORCEMENT THAT WE WOULD

00:33:56.667 --> 00:33:58.903
EXPECT. SO WE NEED TO THEN THIS

00:33:58.970 --> 00:34:00.805
THIS ALSO BILL ALSO

00:34:00.872 --> 00:34:03.441

THAT THEIR INCLUSION THAT.

00:52:31.047 --> 00:52:32.482
WOULD ALLOW THE DEPARTMENT TO

00:52:32.549 --> 00:52:34.417
USE STATE AUTHORIZED AUTHORITY

00:52:34.484 --> 00:52:37.153

DRAWN REMEDY WITHIN THE STATE

00:52:42.759 --> 00:52:44.361

00:52:44.427 --> 00:52:45.996

AND FOR CONSUMERS IN ALL PARTS

00:55:13.610 --> 00:55:15.478

CONSUMERS HAVE A PLACE TO GO TO

00:55:24.020 --> 00:55:26.222
