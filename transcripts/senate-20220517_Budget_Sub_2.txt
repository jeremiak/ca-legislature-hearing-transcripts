BAKER PRIORITIZE PROGRAMS OR PROJECTS GOING FORWARD AT A POINT WHEN THEY DON'T HAVE AVAILABLE RESOURCES AND THEN IT ALSO HELPS ALIGN THE APPROPRIATION THE FISCAL YEAR IN WHICH THE RESOURCES THAT THE REVENUES ARE ARE AVAILABLE- SO JUST GOING A LITTLE BIT INTO THE KIND OF OVERALL I MET BUDGET PICTURE. BUILDING ON. THE LEADERSHIP AND THE HISTORIC FIFTEEN BILLION DOLLAR MULTI YEAR CLIMATE RESILIENT INVESTMENTS THAT WE- ENACTED IN THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET ACT. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET DID PROPOSED AN ADDITIONAL TWENTY TWO POINT FIVE BILLION OVER FIVE YEARS- TRANSFORMATIVE I'M INVESTED TRANSPORTATION ENERGY HELPING EDUCATION QUALIFIER THEY'LL IN DROUGHT AND HEALTH- AND TO CONTINUE TO ADDRESS PRESSING ISSUES THE MAYOR VISION INCLUDES AN ADDITIONAL. NINE POINT FIVE BILLION OVER FOUR YEARS FOR A TOTAL OF THIRTY TWO BILLION THE CONTAINS ADVANCED BASED CLIMATE AN OPPORTUNITY AGENDA. NOW WHEN YOU COMBINE LAST YEAR BURKE INVESTMENT WITH THAT NEW INVESTMENT AND DID BUDGET- THIS REFLECT THE HISTORIC FORTY SEVEN POINT. ONE BILLION INCLINED AND THAT. NOW GOING ON SOME OF THE- KEY MAJOR INVESTMENT THAT WE HAVE IN THE MAYOR VISION AUTHOR OFFER WITH WATERS BILLION AND DROUGHT RESPONSE. SO THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET ACT INCLUDED FIVE POINT TWO BILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT IN CALIFORNIA WATER FROM THE FOR IMMEDIATE RALPH AND LONGER WATERS BILLION- IN THIS YEAR THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET HAD BOTH ADDITIONAL. INVESTMENT OUT SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION GENERAL FUND- NOW GIVEN THE INTO THE VISION OF THE DROUGHT THAT JANUARY. THE MAYOR VISION INCLUDES AN ADDITIONAL ONE POINT THREE BILLION GENERAL FUND AND ALSO ALLOCATE THE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION- DROUGHT CONTINGENCY FROM THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. OR CURRENT BILLION AND RESPOND WHICH IS DESIGNED TO ONE HEALTH COMMUNITY AND FISH OR WILDLIFE AVOID IMMEDIATE NEGATIVE IMPACT AS A RESULT THE CREAM DROUGHT. WHILE TO CONTINUE TO ADVANCE OUR PROJECT A PROGRAM THAT EIGHT TO BE. MORE RESILIENT TO FUTURE GROWTH. THIS INCLUDES FIND ACROSS MANY DIFFERENT- BURKE CATEGORY ADDING- WATER. AND I THINK YOUR WATER ANYTHING WATER PROJECT- AGRICULTURAL CONSERVATION TECHNICAL. LEAD GRANT HERBAL WATER DISTRICT AND SMALL. FIRE FOR RELIEF. ACCORDING DATA AND WATER CONSERVATION EDUCATION CAMPAIGN EMERGENCY DRINKING WATER BOND. ADDRESSING FISH AND WILDLIFE IN FACT BUT BOTH HE WOULD DRIVE I MEAN CHANGED AMONG MANY OTHERS THAT- HOLD OPEN NOTE THAT THE MERE VISION DOES INCLUDE. FIVE HUNDRED MILLION GENERAL FUND. THREE TWENTY FIVE FORTY- BAD- MULTI YEAR. TO PROMOTE STRATEGIC WATER FIVE IN THE- THAT BEEN WATER SUPPLY REALIZED AND THE ENVIRONMENT- THESE RESOURCES WILL BUILD ON THAT TWO POINT SEVEN BILLION PROVIDED IN PROPOSITION ONE UNDER THE WATER STORAGE INVESTMENT PROGRAM- NOW MOVING ON- HAPPENED GREAT- THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET HAVE BOWS- NINE HUNDRED FORTY. MILLION IN THE DISCRETIONARY- HAPPY GREAT FUNDING ACROSS SEVERAL PROGRAMS INCLUDING THEIR MISSION VEHICLE- EIGHTY SIX SEVENTEEN. PROTECTIONS FOR THE PATIENT AT THE- END AND ALTHOUGH COMMUNITY MODERATE- MEMORY CAN BE DOT RESULTED IN AN ADDITIONAL FOUR HUNDRED AND TEN MILLION. IN IN GROSS REVENUES ABOVE BE PRELIMINARY ESTIMATE- WITH A HUNDRED AND TWENTY OF THE FOUR TEN BEING DISCRETIONARY REVENUES. AVAILABLE FOR THE MAY REVISION. SO THE MAYOR MADE PRIORITIZES OTHER THIRTY HUNDRED FOR MILLION OF THE PROGRAM- THAT THE HUNDRED MILLION. TO EXPAND THE NUMBER OF SATELLITE LAUNCHED FOR MAPPING OPERATION I WHICH WILL PROVIDE DEEPLY MEASUREMENT OF LARGE AND- METHANE EMISSIONS IN THE STATE- WHICH ALSO HELP ENHANCE ENFORCEMENT CAPABILITIES. AND THEN AN ADDITIONAL TWENTY MILLION ONE TIME FOR EIGHTY SIX SEVENTEEN MEDIA PROTECTION PROGRAM WHICH WHEN COMBINED WITH THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INVESTMENT- BRING THAT FULL PROGRAM INVESTMENT TO ABOUT TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION- IS ALSO IMPORTANT OTHER PROGRAMS THAT HAVE HISTORICALLY RECEIVED CAP AND TRADE I. LIKE THE TRANSFORMERS I MEDIUM THE BAY METHANE REDUCTION PROGRAMS FARMER HEALTHY FOILED AMONG MANY OTHERS ARE ALSO SET TO REPEAT GENERAL FUND IN TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE ASSOCIATED WITH THE MULTI YEAR. WE'RE ENACT IN LAFAYETTE BUT- NOW MOVING ON THE VATICAN- MARCH THE ADMINISTRATION ACCELERATE ONE POINT SEVEN FIVE BILLION AND- THAT INVESTMENT YOU ARE PRIMARILY SUPPORTER OF PASSENGER VEHICLE INCENTIVES. ARE STILL BE A CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE AND ALTHOUGH UP THE ROAD FROM OPTION PROGRAMS. THE ADMINISTRATION MAYOR. BUILT ON TOP OF THE MARKET COLORATION PROPOSAL BY ACCELERATING ADDITIONAL FIVE HUNDRED AND THIRTY MILLION GENERAL FUND IN BETWEEN WHAT WE DO WHICH BRINGS. COLORATION TO I. TWO POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS FOR DOESN'T THAT. OKAY I'LL RING THE FUNDING WILL ENABLE THE CALIFORNIA EVERY FIRST WORD AND ENERGY COMMISSION TO INITIATE THE PROCESS IMPLEMENT THE FUNDING- IT HELPS CREATE GREATER MARKET FEET AND ALSO ENABLE CONSUMERS TO FIND BETTER FOR VEHICLE PURCHASES. BUT THE CONFIDENCE THAT THEY WILL HAVE ACCESS TO THE REBATE AND THE INFRASTRUCTURE IN THEIR COMMUNITY. I AND WE BELIEVE EARLY PUBLIC INVESTMENT PROVIDED A VERY CLEAR MARKET IN THE PRIVATE MARKET AND ALTHOUGH MAKE THE BET THAT NEXT ELLERY THEIR ACTIVITIES. AND PROVIDE TANGIBLE RELIEF TO CALIFORNIA AND. THEY ARE FACING RECORD HIGH YEAH. NO ON TO THE INVESTMENT WITHIN CAL FIRE INCIDENT THAT WE ARE SEARCH CAPACITY. THAT BEING AND OTHER OPERATIONAL ENHANCEMENTS- THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL BEGIN TO GET YOU ADMIT TO CONTINUE BUILDING OR WILDFIRE DOING A WIDE. AND ALSO EXPANDED THATTHE WILDFIRE RISK ARE AT. THE MAYOR VISION BUILD ON THESE EFFORTS WITH ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR EXPANDED FIREPROOF. AND ERIC BACK OPERATION. THE DIFFICULT. IT INCLUDES- ABOUT EIGHTY AND GENERAL FUND- TO AUGMENT CALIFORNIA HI PROTECTION RESOURCES THROUGH DECEMBER TWENTY TWENTY TWO GIVEN THE CURRENT DROUGHT CONDITIONS INCREASING HIGHER SEVERITY AND FIVE AND ALTHOUGH THE INMATE POPULATION- IN ADDITION THE MAYOR VISION ALSO INCLUDES AN ADDITIONAL A HUNDRED AND FIFTY POINT TWO MILLION AND FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY FIVE PROVISIONS WOULD HAVE HELLFIRE CAPABILITIES TO MEET THE DEMAND OF THE WALL AND FIRE FIGHTING IN A CHANGING CLIMATE. AND THERE'S A FEW DIFFERENT A BET THE BEER- UNDER TO FOUR MILLION AND TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY POSITION THEY'VE BEEN OVER SEVERAL YEARS HI CAL BY OUR STAFFING- RELATED TO APPEAR THE BUYERS THAT WERE INCLUDED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET- THIRTY SEVEN- WE NEED MILLION A HUNDRED NINETY PHYSICIANS WOULD HAVE STAFFING IMPROVE OPERATIONAL EFFECTIVENESS AND ALSO PROVIDES CRITICAL ADMINISTRATIVE AND PROGRAM SUPPORT NECESSARY THE FIFTEEN CAL FIRE'S MISSION FUNCTION IN AN INCREASINGLY COMPLEX ENVIRONMENT AND THEN LASTLY THERE'S NO ADDITIONAL POSITION. IT WITH- YOU QUIT MID A COUPLE OF THE GOVERNOR BUDGET FIREFOX HEALTH AND THEN A COUNTRY FOR THE NEXT IF YOU HELLO THINKERS. I'LL WORK NOW HERE- YOU KNOW RECOGNITION OF THE HEAVY TOLL OF THE AT THAT WALL PARK VIEW IN IMMIGRATION IF YOU THINK EIGHT WITH REPRESENTATIVES FROM FIREFIGHTERS ASSOCIATION ON OPTIONS YOU. THAT I FELT LIGHTER TO GROW THE HEALTH AND WELLNESS OF CALIFORNIA BY PARTS. NOW MOVING ON TO A COUPLE INVESTMENT WITHIN EACH. DEPARTMENT OF PARKS AND RECREATION. OUR VISION DOESN'T WHO AN ADDITIONAL EIGHTY THREE POINT FIVE MILLION THE INCREASE WILL AFFECT. THE BIG PART THROUGH. A ONE TIME THAT. I DIDN'T INCLUDE FIFTEEN MILLION TO EXPAND EXISTING WORKSTATION ENACTED PROGRAMS WORKING THROUGH TWELVE BILLION- FORTY MILLION FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF A NEW BETTER THAN THEIR CENTER AND THAT ALTHOUGH OTHER INTERPRETIVE IMPROVEMENT. AND COLONEL ALLENSWORTH BURKE PARK. FIFTY MILLION OR DEPARTMENT OF PARKS TO PARTNER- WITH THAT CALIFORNIA AFRICAN AMERICAN MUSEUM. TO BETTER TELL ME THE STORY OF BLACK HISTORY AND STATE PARK. AND THEN ALSO. THIRTEEN POINT FIVE MILLION. TO EXPAND THE NUMBER OF OUR PATH TO A MAJOR THROUGH A PILE FOR. TO PROVIDE A PART THAT THIS WORK CHECK OUT A LOCAL- NOW WILL COMPLETE WITH THE ENERGY PACKAGE. SO THAT MAYOR VISION DOES INCLUDE AN ADDITIONAL EIGHT BILLION IN INVESTMENT TO FURTHER STATE ENERGY SYSTEMS RELIANT. INCREASED RELIABILITY AND AFFORDABILITY AND ALSO A CALORIE THE DEPLOYMENT AND RESOURCES NEEDED TO ACHIEVE CALIFORNIA'S CLEAN ENERGY TRANSITION AS WELL AS PROVIDE COMBAT RELIEF TO CALIFORNIA TO HELP HOLD. THEIR IMPACTED BY KOBE NINETEENTH AND DEMI- CLIMATE CHANGE JUST CONTINUE TO CAUSE UNPRECEDENTED STRESS. ON THE STATE ENERGY. IT FOR AND RELIABILITY I WISH WE COULD HELP THAT RECOVER DISPARAGING. BOTH GIVEN GIVEN THE CHALLENGES- THEY'RE VERY INVESTMENT PROPOSED THAT PART OF THE ENERGY PACKAGE. THERE'S A FIVE POINT TWO BILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT. IN STRATEGIC RELIABILITY WHICH INCLUDES FOUR POINT TWO BILLION FOR INVESTMENT AND STRATEGIC RELIABILITY AT THAT AT THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES. AND THEN NINE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION AT THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION UP OR DISTRIBUTED ELECTRICITY BACK ABOUT. AND UTILITY BILL AFTER- THE RESERVE WILL BE STATEWIDE RESOURCE CAPABLE OF PROVIDING UP TO FIVE THOUSAND MEGAWATTS. AVAILABLE WHEN THE GREATEST THREAT. AND THEN WILL INCREASE THE CAPABILITY TO WITHSTAND EXTREME HEAT- AND WITH THAT- CLIMATE EVENT. BUT WILL NOT TAKE THE PLACE OF THE LONGSTANDING OBLIGATION OF ALL LOAD SERVING ENTITIES THAT PROCURE SUFFICIENT RESOURCES TO MAINTAIN RELIABILITY- THE MAYOR VISION ALSO PRODUCE TWO HUNDRED AND NINETY FIVE MILLION. OVER MULTIPLE YEARS OR THE OPERATOR OF THE COMMISSION AND DEVELOPING DEMAND RESPONSE INITIATIVES IBM EFFORTS WILL HELP REDUCE ENERGY DEMAND. DURING. PEAK ENERGY TIMES. THE FACT ALSO. THAT MANY CALIFORNIANS ARE STRUCK TO PAY ALEX BILLS AND- PROVIDE ADDITIONAL ONE POINT TWO BILLION IN REMAIN. OR ELECTRIC UTILITY RATEPAYERS WOULD BE CALIFORNIA. YEAH IT INCLUDES NINE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY MILLION SO THE PUBLIC UTILITY COMMISSION TO PROVIDE RESIDENTIAL SOLAR AND STORAGE SYSTEM INVENTED BY INCLUDING FOR LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS. TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE MILLION- EIGHT INCLUDED IN ENERGY PACKAGE WITH BAD ELECTIONS RCOGNITION. INCLUDING FROM THE FALL IN THE IN THE POOR OF THE STATE WITH YOUR VALUE VISION AND NEED FOR CLEAN BERMAN WHAT COULD BE- FROM NEW GEOTHERMAL REPORT THAT IN THE REGION. AND THEN LAST WEEK TO THE BUILDING ON THE SUCCESS OF THE EPIC PROGRAM WHICH IS THE DATE FOR ME HERE A RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM- THAT CONRAD. THE ONE BILLION PROGRAM TO COMPANIES HEADQUARTERED IN. OKAY UNDEVELOPED COMMERCIAL LIFE I NEW TECHNOLOGY THAT WILL SHE PROCLAIM. AND CLEANER EAGLE. THAT DOES PROVIDE THAT A HIGH LEVEL- OF SOME OF THE KEY BACK THEN AND AGAIN WE HAVE A MEDIUM IS. COLLEAGUES HERE- AVAILABLE THE L. BATCH BUT. OKAY THANK YOU I. THE SELLERS WE HAVE THAT WAS A HIGHLIGHT THE GOVERNOR'S MOVING SOME DROUGHT MONEY FROM LAST YEAR'S PACKAGE TO THIS CURRENT FISCAL YEARS WHICH IS A NICE ACCOUNTING THING THEY'VE GOT. CAP AND TRADE REVENUES THAT THEY'RE GOING TO DO MORE COLLECTION OF DATA BUT NO REDUCTION OF METHANE. AND WE'VE GOT- ACCELERATION GIVEN THE INFLATIONARY CHALLENGES THAT WE'VE HAD SINCE JANUARY WE'RE GOING TAKE SALARY THE PURCHASE OF. A SEPT THE STEP PACKAGE WHICH WILL HAVE HEAT UP THE ECONOMY MORE AND WE HAVE. A LITTLE BIT OF ATTENTION ON- A PARKS AND RECREATION- OF A MODEST ATTENTION BUT NOTHING ON THE MAINTENANCE BACKLOG OF ONE POINT TWO CAN YOU GIVE US. THE L. A. YO'S ANALYSIS OF THIS MAY REVISION. HEY MICHELLE GOOD MORNING RACHEL EHLERS WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE NICE TO SEE YOU ALL MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS- SO AS MISTER AGUILAR JUST WENT OVER THE MAY REVISION IT HAS A LOT A LOT OF ACTIVITIES AND A LOT OF FUNDING. FOR IT FOR YOU TO CONSIDER A MAJOR INCREASES AS NOTED FOR WATER IN DROUGHT FOR ENERGY FOR WHAT DEPRESSION ANYA ALL OF THE SPENDING IS ONE TIME. ASSEMBLY DEPENDING IS FOCUSED ON NEAR TERM IMMEDIATE CHALLENGES LIKE SUMMER WILDFIRES POTENTIAL ENERGY SHORTAGES AB AND DROUGHT UP QUITE A BIT OF IT IS FOCUSED ON LONGER TERM ACTIVITIES AND ISSUES LIKE- YOU KNOW WHAT LONG TERM WATER RELIABILITY. AND ENERGY DECARBONISATION ACTIVITIES ARE SO OVERALL WE THINK THAT THE GOVERNOR IS FOCUSING ON A REASONABLE SET OF ISSUES- THERE'S MERIT OBVIOUSLY FOCUSING ON CLIMATE RELATED CHALLENGES AS WE SPENT MONTHS IN THIS SUB COMMITTEE DISCUSSING- THERE'S MERIT. MKE OF A FOCUS SHORT TERM A LONGER TERM ACTIVITIES AND THERE'S MERIT IN REALLY FOCUSING ON ONE TERM RATHER THAN I'M GOING FUNDING JUST GIVEN FUTURE BUDGET UNCERTAINTY. BUT OVERALL I THINK HER COMMENTS FOR YOU TODAY ARE A LITTLE DIFFERENT THAN THEY MIGHT BE ANOTHER BUDGET CIRCUMSTANCES AND THAT'S REALLY BECAUSE OF THIS OVER ARCHING BUDGET CONSTRAINTS THAT HAS EMERGEDTHE STATE APPROPRIATIONS LIMIT YOURSELF- PER THE CONSTITUTION THE STATE HAS TO SPEND A CERTAIN AMOUNT WHEN THIS. LIMIT IS KIND OF ACTIVE AS IT IS RIGHT NOW- EITHER ON CERTAIN ACTIVITIES THAT ARE EXCLUDABLE FROM THE LIMIT OR ON ON TAX REFUNDS SO- THE ESTIMATES ARE FOR THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR. AND THE BUDGET YEAR BECAUSE IT'S THOUGHT OF KIND OF AS A MULTI YEAR ISSUE THAT THE STATE NEEDS TO SPEND ABOUT FORTY TWO BILLION DOLLARS ON THESE EITHER EXCLUDALE ACTIVITIES ARE TAX REFUNDS ACROSS THOSE THREE YEARS. I AND IN OUR ESTIMATE THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL LEAVES ABOUT THREE POINT FIVE BILLION UNADDRESSED OF THAT REQUIREMENT IN THE BUDGET YEAR TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE. AND WE REALLY STRONGLY RECOMMENDS THAT YOU- DON'T PASS A BUDGET THAT HAS UNADDRESSED STYLE REQUIREMENTS. IN PART BECAUSE WE REALLY SEE A BIG PROBLEM LOOMING ON THE HORIZON IN BUDGET YEAR PLUS. TWENTY THREE. FOUR I WE HAVE ESTIMATES THAT THE STATE WILL HAVE ABOUT A TWENTY TWO BILLION DOLLAR ITSELF ENDING REQUIREMENTS. AND A MUCH LOWER SURPLUS WERE WERE ESTIMATING ONLY ABOUT YOU KNOW ALMOST A TWO BILLION DOLLAR SURPLUS TO ADDRESS THAT- CLASS. THERE ARE SOME VERY CONCERNING SIGNS ON THE HORIZON ABOUT A POTENTIAL RECESSION SO WE'RE REALLY WE'RE REALLY SEEING SOME OUT YOUR CONCERNING SIGNS AND THINK IT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT OPPORTUNITY THIS YEAR TO. HEARING FOR THAT AND ONE OF THE WAYS TO DO THAT IS TO PUT ADDITIONAL FUNDS IN RESERVE. TIME AT THE WAY BUT BECAUSE OF THIS SORT OF ISSUE OF THIS ALEX GLUTAMYL ACTIVITIES AND THE NON. EXCLUDABLE ACTIVITIES ARE THOSE KINDS OF SPENDING THAT COUNT TOWARDS THE LIMIT IT DOES SET UP THIS- SORT OF INTERESTING AND UNUSUAL AB CHALLENGE FOR YOU AS YOU'RE PUTTING TOGETHER YOUR BUDGET. SO I THINK IN SOME OF OUR COMMENTS WE SORT OF CONSIDER THOSE TWO CATEGORIES OF SPENDING SEPARATELY THOSE THAT ARE EXCLUDABLE FROM THE LIMIT AND THOSE THAT DO COUNT TOWARDS THE LIMIT- AND WE THINK THERE'S A REALLY EXCEPTIONALLY HIGH BAR FOR THOSE THAT HAVE. THAT COUNT TOWARDS THE LIMIT BECAUSE THE TRADE OFF IS B. AS- IN PUTTING FUNDING INTO RESERVES. SO FIRST TALKING ABOUT THIS EXCLUDABLE- ACTIVITY WITHIN THIS SUB COMMITTEE ACTUALLY YOUR DISCUSSION IS. A LITTLE DIFFERENT THAN OTHERS BECAUSE MOST OF THE ACTIVITIES PROPOSED ARE EXCLUDABLE MISTER CAPITAL OUTLAY- OR EMERGENCY SPENDING WHICH DOESN'T COUNT TOWARDS THAT LIMIT- BUT EVEN WITHIN THAT THAT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT YOU NEED TO TAKE THE SAME PACKAGE OF EXCLUDABLE ACTIVITIES THAT THE GOVERNOR HAS PROPOSED. AND YOU CAN AND PURSUE SOMETHING THAT PACKAGE OF ACTIVITIES THAT REALLY FOCUSES ON ON WHAT YOU THINK THE HIGHEST PRIORITIES ARE- THERE COULD BE ACTIVITIES THAT THE GOVERNOR'S PRIORITIZING- THAT YOU DON'T THINK ARE ARE. OUR HIGHEST PRIORITIES OR VICE VERSA YOU KNOW JUST AS AN EXAMPLE IN THAT SENATE MAJORITY PACKET YOU DISCUSSED LAST WEEK THERE WAS QUITE A BIT OF FUNDING FOR- COASTAL RESILIENCE AND SEA LEVEL RISE. THAT'S NOT REALLY A LARGE COMPONENT OF THE MAY REVISION BEFORE YOU SO THAT'S JUST ONE EXAMPLE OF A DIFFERENT TYPE OF PRIORITY YOU CAN FOCUS ON. ANOTHER KEY CONSIDERATION TO THINK ABOUT YOUR YOUR PACKAGE AGAIN IN THIS EXCLUDABLE CATEGORY IS CAPACITY- THERE'S BEEN VERY SIGNIFICANT- INVESTMENTS. LAST YEAR AND IN SOME OF THE MULTI YEAR FUNDING THAT WAS APPROVED SO THINK ABOUT. ARE THERE PROGRAMS WHERE MAYBE THERE ISN'T ENOUGH DEMAND DIFFERENT THE AMOUNT. OF FUNDING THAT'S PROPOSED MAYBE EVEN WITH A MULTI YEAR. KIND OF INCOME PERIOD MAYBE THERE ARE ENOUGH- PROJECTS A BACKLOG IN SOME OF THESE AREAS AND MAYBE. AND THERE MIGHT BE OTHER AREAS THAT THAT MIGHT HAVE GREATER CAPACITY. ALSO THINKING ABOUT- PROGRAMS THAT ARE KIND OF NEW AND HAD JUST GOTTEN UP AND RUNNING IS IT PREMATURE PERHAPS TO PUT ADDITIONAL FUNDING IN THERE ARE SOME EXAMPLES UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. I'M FOR EXAMPLE THAT- MULTI BENEFIT LANDRY PURPOSING FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSERVATION. THE STATE PARKS LIBRARY PARTNERSHIP PROGRAM YOU KNOW THE THESE THERE ARE PROGRAMS THAT SHOW A LOT OF PROMISE BUT THEY JUST GOT THE FIRST ROUND OF FUNDING SO DO YOU WANT TO WAIT AND SEE A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT DEMAND BEFORE YOU POTENTIALLY. PUT MORE FUNDING AND- ANOTHER IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION IS JUST THINKING ABOUT THE MIX OF ACTIVITIES TO ACHIEVE YOUR POLICY GOAL SO IN THE WILDFIRE SPACE THINKING ABOUT PREVENTION- VERSES RESPONSE AND HOW YOU WANT TO BALANCE. THAT IN THE ENERGY PACKAGE THINKING ABOUT HOW MUCH YOU THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO FOCUS ON POTENTIAL SHORT TERM- SHORTAGES. AS COMPARED TO LONGER TERM GOALS A PARTICULAR BECAUSE SOME OF THE SHORTER TERM ACTIVITIES DO YOU HAVE- A KIND OF DEPEND ON FOSSIL FUELS. AND GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS WHICH IS A LITTLE BIT COUNTER TO THELONGER TERM GOALS OF THE STATE SO THINKING ABOUT HOW YOU'RE BALANCING THOSE ACTIVITIES- AND THEN ALSO TIMING THIS IS A LOT TO DECIDE ON. RIGHT NOW I AM A BIG PRETTY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. SO IN SOME CASES YOU COULD THINK ABOUT ADOPTING AN ARCHITECTURE OR FRAME. SPENDING A LITTLE BIT MORE TIME OVER THE SUMMER AS YOU DID LAST YEAR. ON DEVELOPING DETAILS. BUT AS YOU MENTIONED MISTER CHAIR QUITE A BIT OF THE SPENDING IS SCORED INTWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO- BECAUSE OF THOSE SALVOR CHOIR MENTIONED SO THAT COULD BE AN EXTRA CONSTRAINT- IN SOME WAYS ABOUT. HOW MUCH TIME YOU HAVE FOR SOME OF THESE AREAS- SO THEN IT'S KIND OF SHIFTING A LITTLE BIT TO THINK ABOUT THAT NON EXCLUDABLE ACTIVITIES SO NOT CAPITAL OUTLAY NOT EMERGENCY SPENDING- THAT DOES COUNT TOWARDS THAT LIMIT AND DOES CREATE A TRADE OFF FOR- FOR EXAMPLE PUTTING MONEY INTO RESERVES. WHICH IS AWESOME NON EXCLUDABLE- AGAIN WE THINK THERE'S A MUCH HIGHER BAR FOR THOSE ACTIVITIES BECAUSE OF THOSE TRADE OFFS THAT COME WITH THEM- SO YOU KNOW THINKING ABOUT SOME OF THE NEW ACTIVITIES THAT ARE PROPOSED THAT. AREN'T ALREADY UNDER WAY WHERE THERE MAY NOT BE A LOT OF DETAIL AVAILABLE THOSE MIGHT BE THINGS YOU MIGHT WANT TO THINK EVEN IF THEY SEEM LIKE THEY HAVE SOME AMERICAN CONCEPT YOU MIGHT WANT TO THINK ABOUT. NOTED SOME OF THE REALLY BIG NEW IDEAS PROPOSED ARE AT CLIMATE INNOVATION GRANTS. M. AND THEN ALSO SOME OF THE CALIFORNIA ADMIN PROPOSALS WHICH ARE ARE ARE NEW- AND AGAIN EVEN WITHIN THIS NON X. LITTLE ACTIVITY REALLY THINKING ABOUT WHAT ARE THE HIGHEST PRIORITIES IF YOU HAVE MOST OF THE WILDFIRE SPENDING. IS NON EXCLUDABLE YOU PROBABLY ARE GOING TO WANT TO DO SOME OF THAT BUT THINKING ABOUT THE MIX OF PREVENTION AND RESPONSE AND WHAT ARE THE HIGHEST PRIORITIES I AM ALSO THINKING ABOUT ONE TIME AND ONGOING- WHERE THERE ARE SOME OF THESE ONGOING PROPOSALS IS THAT SOMETHING YOU REALLY WANT TO COMMIT TO NOW GIVEN THE UNCERTAINTY IN THE FUTURE. I'M JUST SPENDING A MOMENT MENTIONING GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUND AS AS THE CHAIR NOTED. ON THE MAYOR VISION ONLY INCLUDES AN ADDITIONAL FOUR HUNDRED MILLION INTO JACK'S SPENDING- WITH A HUNDRED AND TWENTY MILLION OF THAT ALLOCATED TO NEW DISCRETIONARY SPENDING- THIS WOULD BRING THE TOTAL DISCRETIONARY SPENDING TO ABOUT ONE POINT ONE BILLION. BASED ON OUR OFFICES HIGHER ESTIMATE- REVENUE ESTIMATES WE DO THINK YOU HAVE SOME MORE- THAT YOU COULD KIND OF SAFELY COMMIT TO SPENDING. SPECIFICALLY AN ADDITIONAL FIVE HUNDRED MILLION ROUGHLY- INDISCRETION OR GDR REVENUE. THE G. G. R. F. CAN PLAY A PIECE IN HELPING YOU IN THIS LARGER BUDGET ARCHITECTURE WE DO THINK THERE IS. SOME OPPORTUNITY TO USE G. JEFF AND GENERAL FUND KIND OF STRATEGICALLY AND THINK ABOUT WHICH ACTIVITIES YOU'RE FINDING OUT OF THE G. G. R. F. MAYBE THOSE NON EXCLUDABLE. KIND OF NINE CAP OUTLAY WOULD BE BETTER SUITED FOR GIGI R. F. TO FREE UP SOME OF YOUR GENERAL FUND- TO HELP WITH SOME OF THESE BUDGET ARCHITECTURE ISSUES SO. JUST JUST WANTED TO FIND OUT OF THE POSSIBILITY AND WHERE WHERE OF COURSE HAPPY TO HELP YOU- AS YOU WORK THROUGH THAT.AND THEN THE FINAL POINT I WANTED TO MAKE WAS- REALLY A THEME THAT CAME UP IN YOUR HEARING LAST WEEK THINKING ABOUT OVERSIGHT AND EVALUATION AND- WITH HIS LARGE EXPENDITURES HOW ARE WE ENSURING THAT WE ARE LEARNING WHAT WE'RE GETTING. FOR OUR SPENDING- AND- FUTURE VERSIONS AS WELL. I THAT MIGHT INCLUDE REPORTING. JUST YOU KNOW UNDERSTAND WHAT THE MONEY BOUGHT- BUT ALSO. YOU THINK MORE BROADLY THAN JUST REPORTING LANGUAGE THINKING ABOUT TRUE EVALUATIONS AND ARE THERE. INFORMATION WE WANT TO KIND OF COLLECT BASELINE UP FRIENDS TO BAND MEASURE AGAINST OUTCOMES DO YOU WANT TO PUT SOME FUNDING IN FOR MORE RIGOROUS KIND OF SCIENTIFIC EVALUATION AND SOME OF THESE CASES PARTICULARLY WHERE THERE ARE PILOT PROGRAMS THAT ARE PROPOSED- JUST SO THAT WE ARE. NOT ONLY ENSURING THAT WE'RE SPENDING STATE DOLLARS EFFECTIVELY BUT AGAIN REALLY AS WE'RE WORKING ON THESE. KIND OF GENERATIONAL- EXISTENTIAL CHALLENGES FROM FROM CLIMATE CHANGE IN PARTICULAR HOW DO WE KNOW WHAT'S WORKING HOW CAN WE BE- INFORMING OUR FUTURE DECISIONS AND MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE BEING AS STRATEGIC AS POSSIBLE. SO WITH THAT HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS AND MY COLLEAGUES ARE HERE ON THE CALL AS WELL. THANK YOU. THANK YOU- SECRETARY CROWFOOT YOU HAVE- VARIOUS DEPARTMENTS YOU'VE GOT YOUR NATURE BASED SOLUTIONS- THE CALIFORNIA REPLETE WITH FINANCE TALKED ABOUT THAT PARKS AND RECREATION- GOOD MORNING THE BILL GOOD MORNING CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE LET ME FIRST THANK YOU CHAIR FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS ON THE SUBCOMMITTEE. YOU KNOW MUCH OF WHAT OF THE PROGRESS WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO MAKE FRANKLY IS AS A RESULT OF THE LEADERSHIP AND- FORTITUDE OF YOU AND YOUR COLLEAGUES ON THIS SUBCOMMITTEE AND I UNDERSTAND GIVEN TERM LIMITS THIS MAYBE YOUR YOUR THE LAST BUDGET YOU HELPED TO SHAPE SO JUST ON BEHALF OF OUR ENTIRE AGENCY AND DEPARTMENTS I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR ALL THAT YOU'VE DONE AND CAN KIND I WAS WONDERING IF SO MANY PEOPLE FROM THE DEPARTMENTS ARE ON JUST TO. SEE THE LAST SHOW OR THEY ACTUALLY WANT TO ANSWER THE QUESTIONS BUT I'LL PUT THAT ASIDE- PLEASE PROCEED THANK YOU KNOW WE DO THIS WORKING TREMENDOUSLY CHALLENGING TIMES CLIMATE CHANGE IS ACCELERATING AND GENERATING IMPACT IN CALIFORNIA THAT WE EXPECTED. IN THE MIDDLE PART OF THE CENTURY OR EVEN TOWARDS THE END OF THE CENTURY. WE'RE IN THE THIRD YEAR OF A WORSENING DROUGHT. WE'RE STARING DOWN THE BARREL OF WHAT COULD BE ANOTHER CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRE SEASON. AND EXTREME HEAT. AND THIS HEAT WAVE THAT HIT THE ENTIRE SOUTHWEST. ARE STRESSING OUR EECTRICITY GRID I CERTAINLY MORE THAN WE HAD ANTICIPATED. SEVERAL YEARS AGO SO I THINK YOU FOR YOUR FOCUS ON ACTING QUICKLY AND DECISIVELY ON INVESTMENTS. THERE IS A WHOLE LOT BETWEEN THE JANUARY PROPOSAL AND THE MAY REVISION TO CONSIDER. AND WE WOULD REALLY APPRECIATE DOING SO AS AS- AS MUCH AS YOU CAN TO REALLY GET THIS FUNDING OUT THE DOOR TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE. BUILDING OUR RESILIENCE TO CLIMATE CHANGE- I WANT TO. WANT TO PUT A SPECIAL PLUGIN FOR IN BACK. IN OUR DEPARTMENTS AND IN OUR PEOPLE. THAT ARE DELIVERING THESE PROGRAMS. YOU KNOW WE'VE HAD REMARKABLE REVENUE GROWTH AS WE KNOW IN THIS ONE TIME FUNDING AS A RESULT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO MAKE. HISTORIC INVESTMENTS. IN MANY CASES. WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO SCALE UP THE STAFF. AND THE TEAM WITHIN OUR DEPARTMENTS THAT ARE ACTUALLY GETTING THAT FUNDING OUT THE DOOR AND SUPPORTING ALL OF OUR PARTNERS. HEALTHCARE IS A GREAT EXAMPLE. YOU KNOW WE TALK ABOUT THE HEROISM OF CALIFORNIA- FOLKS IN UNIFORM. BUT THERE ARE HEROES ACROSS CALIFORNIA- THAT HAVE BEEN WORKING TO. ADMINISTER A BUDGET THAT'S WELL OVER DOUBLE IT WHAT IT USED TO BE JUST A FEW YEARS AGO. I AM WE HAVEN'T GROWN ADMINISTRATIVE CAPACITY. I IN MANY OF OUR DEPARTMENT SO WHERE YOU DO SEE FUNDING FOR CRITICAL STAFF POSITIONS. IT MAY NOT BE AS ALLURING AS SOME OF OUR NEW PROJECTS OR OR PROJECTS GETTING OUT ON THE GROUND. BUT I CAN TELL YOU TO MAINTAIN. OUR OUR. BUSINESS IN. IN THAT THE PACE OF ACTS THAT WILL NEED TO OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS. THOSE INVESTMENTS ARE REALLY REALLY CRITICAL. SO THAT'S JUST A TOP LINE COLOR COMMENTARY ONCE AGAIN HUGE THANKS TO OUR DEPARTMENTS YOU HAVE EXPERTS ACROSS OUR AGENCIES. DAN AGENCY TO ANSWER SPECIFIC QUESTIONS IF YOU HAVE THEM. WELL THANK YOU I'M- NOT GOING TO WERE ANYBODY. CENTER DOLLY HE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS- SO I DO HAVE- QUITE A FEW THINGS I WANTED TO JUST TO. I WENT OUT TO LA- ABOUT THIS FISCAL CLIFF THAT YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT WHAT YOUR PROJECT PROJECTION- TWENTY TWENTY THREE IS CAN YOU GIVE US A LITTLE MORE BACKGROUND ON WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ONE TIME EXPERT MOST OF THIS IS A ONE TIME EXPENDITURES BUT- WE HAVE ONGOING. ISSUES YEAH AND THANK YOU SENATOR I THINK MOST OF THE CONCERN REALLY DOES COME FROM THIS KIND OF NEW- WELL IT'S NOT NEW IT'S BEEN IT WAS APPROVED BY VOTERS IN NINETEEN SEVENTY NINE BUT JUST THIS EMERGING- AB STATE APPROPRIATIONS LIMIT OR SELF CONSTRAINT WHERE IT REQUIRES THAT A CERTAIN PORTION ARE AND NOW DEFENDING THERE'S A LINK TO THE AMOUNT OF REVENUES THAT ARE RAISED- EITHER BEING. SPENT ON THESE EXCLUDABLE PURPOSES OR OR GIVEN BACK AS TAX REFUNDS AND WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO HANDLE THAT- OR ADDRESS THAT IN THE MOST RECENT YEARS BECAUSE OF THIS REALLY UNPRECEDENTED SURPLUS. THAT WE HAVE KIND OF THIS SORT OF. A FINDING THAT IS THAT IS NOT DEDICATED TO OUR ON GOING EXISTING PROGRAMS THAT CAN INSTEAD BE AB DIRECTED TO ADDRESS THIS- THESE THESE REQUIREMENTS. ARE BUT AS WE'RE LOOKING AT HAD YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT WE'RE NOT FORECASTING THAT LEVEL OF SURPLUS TO CONTINUALLY REALLY DIDN'T SEE IT AS AS KIND OF AN UNEXPECTED UNANTICIPATED- LARGE ONE TIME WINDFALL AND SO. WHEN HAVING THESE CONSTRAINTS AND THESE REQUIREMENTS FOR A CERTAIN TYPE OF SPENDING WITHOUT THAT- OKAY UNACCOUNTED FOR. EXTRA FEW WELL FUNDING MEANS THAT WE EITHER NEED TO COME UP WITH A FUNDING ELSEWHERE- YOU KNOW FROM RESERVES WITH IS OBVIOUSLY THE LEAST IMPACTFUL OR LOOK INTO BASED PROGRAMMING SO IT IS IT IS A NEW. CONSTRAINTS AND- ARCHITECTURE SITUATION THAT THE BUDGET HAS TO DEAL WITH THAT IS THAT HASN'T BEEN IN THE PAST- SO THAT'S ONE SET OF CONCERNS AND THEN THE OTHER IS THERE ARE AGAIN PRETTY PRETTY CONCERNING SIGNS OF A POTENTIAL RECESSION- KIND OF ON THE HORIZON. WHICH WOULD ALSO COMPLICATE THINGS IF WE IF WE HAVE LESS REVENUE OF COURSE IF WE HAVE LESS REVENUE IT ALSO MEANS THAT ARE SELF FUNDING REQUIREMENTS BUT DOWN SO THAT HELPS A LITTLE BIT IN THAT AREA BUT- YOU KNOW A LOT OF A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY I THINK. SPENDING AND SO I THINK. PART OF OUR BIG MESSAGE IS OBVIOUSLY YOU HAVE TO DRESS YOURSELF CONCERNED REQUIRED- DOES HE SHARE WITH THE WITH SOME OF THIS EXCLUDING. INTO REFUND PROPOSAL. BUT TO THE DEGREE. YOU CAN MINIMIZE YOUR- ON THE HONDA. ACTIVITIES THAT ARE SUBJECT TO THE LIMIT AND INSTEAD PUT THAT FUNDING IN RESERVES WE THINK IT WILL REALLY HELP YOU. AT IN THE IN THE YEARS TO COME. THANK YOU. LIKE TO DIRECT MY QUESTIONS TO- MR CROWFOOT AND HIS DEPARTMENT- SO LAST YEAR WE HEARD FROM DIRECTOR BONHAM ABOUT THE HATCHERIES WE HAD SOME BIG ISSUES IN THE HATCHERIES AND- IN IN THE IN THIS. IN THE IN THE WATER PORTION OF ALL OF MY NOTES HERE THERE'S GOING TO BE QUITE A FEW P. WISE ADDITIONAL STAFF. AND IF YOU COULD GIVE ME AN UPDATE ON WHERE THE RESOURCES THAT WE SPENT LAST YEAR ON THE HATCHERIES IN THIS IN THIS SITUATION WITH THE HATCHERIES- THROUGHOUT OUR SYSTEM IN THE IN THE LEAST IN THE NORTHERN PART OF STATE I'M- WAS WANTED TO GET AN UPDATE ON THAT. AND THEN THE SECOND QUESTION I HAVE- IS ABOUT- THOUGH WE ALSO AUTHORIZED FUNDS IN THE LAST COUPLE OF BUDGETS TO- BASICALLY. GET OUR WATER RIGHT SYSTEM- DATA SYSTEM. SET IN A WAY WHERE IT'S NOT A PAPER WOULD BE ONLINE AND I WANTED TO GET AN UPDATE ON WHERE WE'RE AT ON THAT THOSE PROJECTS THAT WE FUNDED IN THE LAST BUDGET CYCLE. YEAH I THINK SO THANKS SO MUCH SENATOR LET ME TURN TO DIRECTOR JOHN BONHAM AT FISH AND WILDLIFE FOR THE FIRST QUESTION. AND THEN OF COURSE OUR OUR COLLEAGUE CHAIR JOAQUIN ASK ABOUT AT THE STATE WATER BOARD FOR THE SECOND. SENATOR DOLLY THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION ABOUT- HATCHERIES THREE THINGS IN RESPONSE. WELL I DON'T HAVE ALL THE METRICS- READING MY FINGER TIPS WE CAN FOLLOW UP WITH YOUR OFFICE AND GIVE A PRECISE ACCOUNTING. OF THE CURRENT BUDGET AND THE PRIOR BUDGET. WHERE THE LEGISLATURE AND GOVERNOR AUTHORIZED US FIXING CERTAIN INFRASTRUCTURE ACROSS OUR WHOLE SYSTEM. SO WE CAN IDENTIFY THE EXACT NUMBER PROJECTS NUMBER OF NEW TRAILERS NEW CHILLERS NEW UV SYSTEMS ETCETERA AND WE'D BE GLAD TO FOLLOW UP WITH YOU ON THAT FRONT. SECOND WITHIN THE MAY REVISE RIGHT NOW IS A SEPARATE PROPOSAL THAT YOU MAY BE REFERRING TO ABOUT OUR HATCHERIES AND INLAND FISHERIES FUND REALIGNMENT. AND THAT MAY REVISED PROPOSAL WOULD DEDICATE FIFTEEN PERMANENT POSITIONS THE LABOR FORCE WITHIN OUR HATCHERIES AS SECRETARY CROWFOOT WAS MENTIONING. WE'VE HAD INFRASTRUCTURE CHANGE WE'VE HAD PRODUCTION INCREASE BUT WE ALWAYS HAVEN'T HAVEN'T ALWAYS FOLLOWED WITH THE NECESSARY NUMBER OF PEOPLE TO DO THE WORK IN THE HATCHERIES WHICH ARE OFTEN OUT IN THE RURAL LANDSCAPE. SO THAT'S POINT NUMBER TWO AND THEN THIRD. WITHIN THIS MAY REVISED IS ALSO ANOTHER HATCHERY RELATED PROPOSAL SOMEONE SEPARATE SO I THINK IT'S SEVENTEEN MILLION DOLLARS. AND THIS PROPOSAL IS TO LOOK ACROSS ALL OF THE TWENTY ONE STATE AND FEDERAL HATCHERIES IN CALIFORNIA. AND WITH EXPERT HELP ANALYZE WHAT PRESSURES THEY'LL FACE UNDER CLIMATE CHANGE AND FIVE TEN FIFTEEN YEARS OUT. AND THEN BEGAN TO MAKE THOSE CHANGES A VERY GOOD EXAMPLE RUSSIAN RIVER WARM SPRINGS HATCHERY LAST YEAR IN THE DROUGHT WITH THE U. S. ARMY CORPS WE ALMOST RAN OUT OF COLD WATER IN THE RESERVOIR. AND HAD TO SHUTTER THE HATCHERY WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO RELY ON A LARGE RESERVOIRS ABOVE HATCHERIES FOR COLD WATER ANYMORE AND THE SEVENTEEN MILLION DOLLARS SUSSMAN SPEAKS TO ANALYZING AND FIXING FOR THAT FUTURE PROOFING BOTTOM I PUSH IT THAT I WANTED TO- ALSO PUBLICLY APOLOGIZE TO YOU- LAST I THINK WAS LAST WEEK I MENTIONED THIS SAFE HARBOR AGREEMENTS AND YOU REACHED OUT TO ME APPARENTLY YOUR PHONE. WAS BLOWING UP I APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE BEEN WORKING ON THOSE ISSUES UP IN AND SISKIYOU COUNTY- THE OTHER THING I WANTED TO ASK ABOUT WAS THE YEARS-FUNDING IN HERE FOR- CANNABIS- HELP I THINK IT IS FOR BUT IT IT'S BASICALLY HOWEVER. WHO IS TAKING CARE THAT THERE'S POSITIONS FOR CANNABIS I THINK IT'S TWENTY POSITIONS FOR IT'S COMING OUT THE CANNABIS BUDGET. OF NORTON POINT HERE. YES ACTUALLY SIXTY ONE POSITIONS ON GOING- SO HOW'S THIS GOING TO WORK IS THIS GOING TO BE- IN SUPPORT OF THE LOCALITIES BECAUSE IN THE DID IN THE IN THE COUNTIES THAT I REPRESENT THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES- GETTING CODE ENFORCEMENT AND ENOUGH LAW ENFORCEMENT TO GO IN. AND AND DEAL WITH THE ILLEGAL GROWS THAT WE HAVE- IT THROUGHOUT MY DISTRICT AND I KNOW THROUGHOUT THE STATE IT'S A HUGE PROBLEM. YEAH I THINK SO MUCH I WOULD FIRST MAYBE TURNED AT THE CHARLESTON WELL TO ANSWER THE QUESTION ON THE- ON WATER RATES TO TODAY'S DEBATE DIGITIZATION- AND INTERNET SHOPPING JOAQUIN ON THE QUESTION OF CANNABIS POSITIONS. OR MIGHT. YEAH THANK YOU SENATOR ON- THE- FUNDING THAT WE RECEIVED LAST YEAR WHICH WAS THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS TO- UPDATE OUR WATER RATES DATA SYSTEM SO THIS IS THE ELECTRONIC WATER RATES SYSTEM THAT HAVEN'T BEEN UPDATED- HERE IN SOME DECADES I IS IN A GOOD PLACE WHERE ACTUALLY ACTIVELY SELECTING CURRENTLY UP UNDER WE'VE TAKEN- WHAT ARE IMPROVEMENTS IN PROCUREMENT FOR OTHER AGENCIES THAT THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY AND OTHERS. HAVE REALLY ADVANCE TO BE ABLE TO HELP STATE AGENCIES BETTER NAVIGATE AND COME QUICKLY TO A FINISHED PRODUCT- AND SO WE'RE REALLY I'M HOPEFUL THAT HERE WITHIN THE NEXT YEAR- EVEN AS WHERE WE'RE GOING TO UNDER IN SELECTING A VENDOR BURKE WE'RE ALREADY SANDBOXING WITH REAL SYSTEMS AND BEING ABLE TO WORK- RELATIVELY QUICKLY FOR AN AGENCY THAT. HAS IS REALLY NEEDED- AND INVESTMENT LIKE THAT TEN MILLION OF IT IS TO DIGITIZE- WHAT OUR PAPER RECORDS. AND THAT ACTUALLY PART OF THAT AND THE CONTRACTS AND DISCUSSIONS ARE GOING ON FOR THE SYSTEM THAT WE'RE WE'RE LOOKING TO BE ABLE TO INVEST IN IN HERE WITHIN THE NEXT YEAR HAVE WHEN IT COMES TO THE POSITIONS THAT WE REQUESTED FOR THIS FISCAL- COMING FISCAL YEAR THIS WILL REALLY COMPLEMENT ALL THE INCREDIBLE WORK THAT'S GONE LAST YEAR TO WORK WITH WATER RIGHT HOLDERS IN VARIOUS OTHER STATES INCLUDING UP IN THE KLAMATH WATERSHED ON SCOTTISH SHASTA- AS WELL AS THE RUSSIAN RIVER WATERSHED IN AND BROUGHT THE DELTA. TO BETTER IT ACTUALLY HAVE BEEN MISSED. AND WHO HAS HAS ACCESS TO WHAT CAN BE ABLE TO ONE REPORTERS IN THEIR WATERSHED TO BE ABLE TO MAKE WHAT ARE VERY DIFFICULT DECISIONS IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS DROUGHT SO THAT THE POSITIONS OF REQUESTING NOW REALLY COMPLIMENT WHAT IS THAT INITIAL INVESTMENT IN JUST THAT THE DATA BACK AND WHICH- YOU KNOW IT IT REALLY TOUCHES SO MANY OTHER ASPECTS OF THE PORTS WORK- IT'S YOU KNOW OUR OUR WATER RIGHTS THE SYSTEM DOESN'T JUST LIVE IN A SILO SO WHAT IS ACTUALLY HELPING US TO REALLY IS ACCELERATE A LOT OF MODERNIZATION AT THE WATER BOARD THAT WE THOUGHT SOARED. IT WILL TELL. INTEGRATE DATA. ACROSS NOT JUST WATER RIGHTS BUT WATER QUALITY. DRINKING WATER AND RESPONSE TO COMMUNITIES EVEN. AND ROUTE SO- APPRECIATE THE REQUEST ON THE UPDATE AND GLAD TO. BE ABLE TO A BIG BROTHER ON ON HOW THE PROJECTS GOING OVER THIS NEXT YEAR. SO WE HAVEN'T LET A CONTRACT OUT YET THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE SAYING. I WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF- AND I HAVE THE I'VE I'M NOT PART OF THE SELECTION OF THAT THAT'S ALL HANDLED APPROPRIATELY UNDERSTAND- FOLKS IN THE MIDDLE OF SELECTING THAT BACK. AND- THANK YOU. CENTER AS THE CANNABIS SPECIFICALLY FOR OUR DEPARTMENT TWO THINGS BACK IN JANUARY- TEN AND THAT BUDGET PROPOSAL FROM THE ADMINISTRATION OUR DEPARTMENT- SIX- SEVEN LIMITED TERM POSITIONS THOSE ARE FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF ASSEMBLY BILL ONE FORTY ONE WHICH IS YOU KNOW IS AROUND- DEPARTMENT OF CANNABIS CONTROLS LICENSURE AND PROVISIONAL LICENSES WE WILL HAVE A WORKLOAD ASSOCIATED WITH THAT. I THINK YOUR QUESTIONS MORE ABOUT OUR WILDLIFEOFFICERS WE HAVE OUR OFFICER RANKED AS HIGH AS EVER BEEN BECAUSE THE GOVERNOR NEWSOM'S LEADERSHIP AND WE'RE IN PRETTY REGULAR COORDINATION WITH THE SHERIFF AND SISKIYOU COUNTY AND OTHER COUNTIES IN YOUR DISTRICT AND WILL REMAIN SO BECAUSE THIS IS THE TIME OF YEAR WHERE WERE WORKING OUT IN A JOINT FORCE DEPLOYMENT TO DEAL WITH THESE ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES ACROSS THE NORTHERN PART OF THE STATE. AND IT SHOULD BE USEFUL WE PROVIDE A FOLLOW UP WITH YOUR OFFICE OFFLINE ABOUT THE- I PERSONALLY MY GOODNESS WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THE SIXTY ONE INJECTIONS THAT WERE REFERENCED WERE ACTUALLY POSITIONS WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF PARKS RECREATION- THESE POSITIONS WILL WORK ON THAT. PREVENTING ILLEGAL CANNABIS- CULTIVATION STATE PARKS REMEDIATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT RESTORATION OF NATURAL HABITATS IMPACTED BY ILLEGAL CANNABIS GROWS. AND I CAN CONFIRM THAT THEY WILL ALSO BE COORDINATING WITH LOCALS ON. SO. OKAY THE PROJECT OUT TO SO I WANTED TO MOVE ON TO CALIFORNIA- I DO HAVE A COUPLE CONCERNS I MENTION THIS TO. OTHER MEMBERS ON THE COMMITTEE- SO A LOT OF OUR- FUEL REDUCTION PROJECTS THAT HAVE BEEN LAID OUT IN YEARS PAST HAVE- WE'RE BID THE CONTRACT WERE BIT BY THE CONTRACTORS. ON FUEL COSTS THAT WERE AROUND THREE DOLLARS A GALLON AND THAT'S DOUBLED. SINCE THEY'VE TAKEN THOSE CONTRACTS SO MANY THOSE CONTRACTORS- THAT I'M HEARING FROM- THROUGHOUT THE DISTRICT AND THROUGHOUT THE STATE ARE NOT ABLE TO. MAKE MAKE A PROFIT QUITE FRANKLY AND SO THERE THERE'S BEEN A MOST THEIR RESOURCES ON APPEAL SO IS THERE AN ABILITY- FOR A STIPEND. TO EXISTING CONTRACTS- SO WE CAN KEEP THOSE- FUEL- REDUCTION PROJECTS GOING THROUGHOUT THE STATE. THAT'S SOMETHING WE CAN CERTAINLY LOOK INTO. M. WE ARE REALLY PROUD OF. USING THE FUNDING THAT YOU ALL PROVIDED LAST YEAR STARTING WITH THAT EARLY ACTION BUDGET IN APRIL FIVE HUNDRED THIRTY SIX. MILLION DOLLARS FOLLOWED UP BY EIGHT HUNDRED SOME ODD MILLION. I JUST SEVERAL MONTHS LATER AND WE'VE GOT OVER FIVE HUNDRED. PROJECTS WELL OVER FIVE HUNDRED PROJECTS I THINK UNDER WAY AS A RESULT OF THAT MONEY DOES THOSE PROACTIVE- VEGETATION MANAGEMENT WILDFIRE RESILIENCE PROJECTS- THE CONCERN YOU RAISED IS THE FIRST TIME I'VE HEARD IT AND SO I CAN COMMIT THAT BUT WE WILL GET BACK TO YOU FROM OUR AGENCY. FOR THOSE GRANT PROGRAMS THAT ENTITIES THAT ARE NOT RELATED TO CAL FIRE I ADMINISTER AND THEN I WOULD TURN IT OVER TO CHIEF TYLER TO ANSWER ON BEHALF OF CAL FIRE. THANK YOU SENATOR DOLLY FOR THE QUESTION A SOMEWHERE TO SECRETARY PRO BUT- IT WOULD BE IMPORTANT TO ENSURE THAT OTHER GRANTEES ARE WORKING WITH THEIR LOCAL- GRANT ADMINISTRATORS BUT IT IS- HEARD LOUD AND CLEAR- I WILL- CONFER WITH STAFF HERE- TO FIGURE OUT A WAY. RECOGNIZING THE INCREASE AND IN FUEL COSTS FOR THOSE FUNDS. THIS JUST FYI SO IF YOU'RE A LOT OF THESE PROJECTS ARE FUNDED NOT JUST BY BY A CONSERVANCY A FIRE CITY COUNCIL FEDERAL MONIES ALL THESE MONIES ARE COMPILED TOGETHER FOR A LOT OF THESE. PROJECTS WERE THEIR PROJECTS CROSSOVER FROM PRIVATE PUBLIC AND FEDERAL LANDS AND SO THE THEIR LET THE CONTRACTS HAVE BEEN LET FOR SO MANY DOLLARS PER ACRE TO TREAT. AND THEN YOU KNOW THEY THEIR OF THEIR TO COUPLE YOUR CONTRACT WILL WHEN THE WHEN THE PRICE OF FUEL GOES UP. THESE CONTRACTORS IMMUNITY IS DOUBLING THEIR COST OF FUEL SO THEY'RE NOT ABLE TO TREAT THE ACRES- BECAUSE THEY JUST FRANKLY ARE LOSING MONEY AND SO THEY'RE STOPPING- AND WAITING FOR THE FUEL TO COME DOWN WHAT MAY BE A LONG TIME BEFORE THE FUEL COMES DOWN WE NEED TO TREAT THOSE ACRE SO. I BROUGHT IT UP TO CENTER MCGUIRE I KNOW THAT HE'S HE'S AWARE OF IT BUT THERE'S THERE ARE FORMULAS- THAT WE ALL USE IN PRIVATE INDUSTRY I'M IN THE TRUCKING BUSINESS WE HAVE A FORMULA THAT ADDS FUEL GOES UP. THERE'S AND THERE'S A FUEL SURCHARGE PUT ON. AN IDENTITY QUAID'S TO WHATEVER THE AMOUNT IS SO THAT THE CONTRACTOR CAN CONTINUE TO WORK IN. AND CREATE AND FINISH PROJECT UNFORTUNATELY. OUR GRANT PROGRAMS DON'T KNOW THEY- ARE. A FIXED AMOUNT. SO THERE HAS TO BE SOME. OF THE- ABILITY TO BUILD A PUT IN. THOSE FUNDS TO COVER THOSE COSTS SO I JUST WANTED TO DO I WANTED ON RECORD I KNOW IT'S A PROBLEM. WE NEED TO TREAT THESE ACRES- SOONER THAN LATER SO- I'M HOPING THAT WE CAN FIGURE THAT OUT THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS MY LAST. A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS- I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE GRID- ROUTE. BRED RELIABILITY- I DIDN'T SEE MUCH IN HERE ABOUT- TRANSMISSION IN CALIFORNIA FOR GETTING POWER WHERE WE NEED. TO MOVE IT AROUND BECAUSE OUR GREAT IS ANTIQUATED- THAT'S ONE QUESTION IT WHAT'S WHAT'S THE PLAN FOR LONG TERM STABILITY IN THE GREAT WE HAVE A LOT IN HERE. ON ON ZAPS IN DRIED STRIKES AND ALL THESE THINGS THAT ARE GOING TO USE- THERE'S EIGHT SIX BILLION DOLLARS OVER THE NEXT FOUR YEARS ON ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES. I'D LIKE FOR SOMEBODY TO TOUCH ON- THE GRID RELIABILITY- WE'RE TALKING ABOUT- ROLLING BLACKOUTS THIS SUMMER AND WERE. YOU KNOW TALKING ABOUT TAKING OFF- POWER PLANTS LIKE- THE ONE IN SAN LUIS OBISPO THE NUCLEAR BLAST NUCLEAR PLANT IN CALIFORNIA SO CAN SOMEBODY ADDRESS. A GRID RELIABILITY FOR THE FOR THE OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS- PUTTING ALL THESE- YOU KNOW ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES. ON THE GRID QUITE FRANKLY THAT'S WHAT THAT THAT'S SOMETHING I'D LIKE TO SEE WHAT THE LONG TERM PLAN IS BORDERS SHORT TERM PLAN THEY JUST CAN. CONTINUE TO BUILD MORE ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES FROM WHAT I SEE HERE IT DOESN'T TALK ABOUT GRID RELIABILITY. YEAH I THINK SENATOR WE'VE GOT LEADERS FROM BOTH THE ENERGY COMMISSION AND ARE INDEPENDENT SYSTEM OPERATOR IT'LL TURN TO IN JUST A MOMENT. I WILL JUST EMPHASIZE BOTH RELIABILITY AND AFFORDABILITY ARE KEY PRIORITIES AS WE MODERNIZE OUR GRID. AND AS WE ALL KNOW WE'RE DEALING WITH THESE UNPRECEDENTED HEAT WAVES ACROSS THE ENTIRE SOUTHWEST THAT ARE STRAINING OUR GRAD. SO A LOT OF INVESTMENT IN THE IN NEAR TERM RELIABILITY- BUT TO YOUR QUESTION- LET ME TURN TO COMMISSIONER SEE ABOUT GOING TO. OUR FIRST- TO ANSWER. THANK YOU SENATOR FOR YOUR QUESTION I WOULD I WOULD KIND OF PLACE THAT THE STATED THAT MANY HIGH LEVEL I'M DELIGHTED YET YOU. ASKED FOR AND I WOULD. REQUEST COLLEAGUES FROM. CALAVERAS A TO HELP ANSWER THE TENTH WE SHOULD QUESTION PARTICULARLY IN HOW WE'RE PLANNING FOR THAT. IN TERMS OF- THE LIABILITY PLANNING. FOR THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS AS YOU AND DENOTE. WE HAVE HAD A LOT OF DIFFICULTY MAKING SURE. WE CAN BALANCE SUPPLY AND DEMAND- AND TO ENSURE THAT THAT WE'RE ABLE TO DO ADEQUATE PLANNING. AND I WOULD I WOULD WANT TO GO TO THE AS TO THE S. AND P. METICULOUS STEPS THAT'S HOW WE THINKING CARRILLO. SO ONE YOU KNOW APPY OBSERVATIONS OF. AUGUST TWENTY TWENTY- WE ARE VERY CLEAR AND IT'S PRETTY CLEAR TO US THAT CALIFORNIA. IS AT THE TIP OF THE CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS TO. BOTH OUR DEMAND SIDE AS WELL AS SUPPLY SIDE. SO WE ARE DOING. EVERYTHING WE CAN IN TERMS OF UNDERSTANDING THE RISK I TO DEMAND. AS WELL AS SUPPLY AS WE PLAN TO THE NEXT. FIVE YEARS THE FIRST STEP ABOUT THIS IS STILL DOING ADEQUATE PLANNING TAKING ALL OF THOSE THINGS INTO ACCOUNT. AND ENSURING ENOUGH PROCUREMENT HAVE BEEN OPTIMIZED REPORTS THAT. SECOND TEMPLE THAT WOULD BE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE AUTHORIZED PROCUREMENT IS ACTUALLY BEING BILLED IN A TIMELY FASHION. AND FINALLY THE THIRD PART OF IT IS ACTUALLY GOING TO A PARTICULAR SUMMER. WE LOOK AT- WHAT IF WHAT IS ON THE HORIZON OVER THE NEXT SIX MONTHS. AND THINK THROUGH WHAT EXTRAORDINARY- MEASURES SHOULD BE TAKEN IN ORDER TO TAKE YOUR ADDED THAT A LIABILITY AND IN THE SHORT TERM. ON THE PLANNING AND PROCUREMENT OPERATING OF THE PROCUREMENT PART. WE HAVE DONE A NUMBER OF. THE STATE HAS TAKEN A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT ACTIONS. IN TERMS OF PLANNING FOR CERTAIN LEVELS OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND AUTOMATING PROCUREMENT- SO IF YOU HAVE AUTHORIZED- A LARGE AMOUNT APPROACH GOVERNMENT I ALMOST FIVE THOUSAND. MEGAWATTS OF NEW. OUT COMMUNITIES. TO SUPPORT THE GRADE TAKING INTO ACCOUNT- THE LAY BUT THAT IT TOOK. THAT YOU AMEND. AND THEN WE- YOU KNOW AS WE LOOK THROUGH. THAT THE POPE THAT WE'VE- IT ALSO TAKE A ACCOUNT. THAT THE DIFFERENT RESOURCES WE EXPECT TO RETIRE INCLUDING. ADDED DIABLO CANYON AT TWO THOUSAND MEGAWATTS ROUGHLY AS WELL AS SOME OF THEIR LEGACY- ONCE THROUGH COOLING AFTER THAT I KNOW ABOUT ABOUT FOUR THOUSAND MEGAWATTS. SO WE HAVE TAKEN THAT INTO ACCOUNT. WHAT ONE OF THE THINGS WE WERE NOT ABLE TO CATCH NOT PLAN IS. A COMPOSITE COINCIDENTAL EVENTS THAT ARE CONTINUING TO UNRAVEL. APPLE IN- AUGUST TWENTY TWENTY WE LOK AT HIGH HEAT- POSSIBILITY OF START PLANNING FOR HIGH HEAT. BUT WHAT WE OBSERVE IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE WHAT ARE THE LIABILITY SITUATION WAS NOT BECAUSE OF HIGH KEY IT WAS MORE BECAUSE THE FIRES AND FIRE RELATED OUTAGES PUT ON THE TRANSMISSION OF LAST GENERATION SITE. SO WE'RE TAKING THOSE THINGS INTO ACCOUNT AND TRYING TO PLAN THROUGH AND NOW AS WE LOOK AT THE COINCIDENTAL NATURE OF ALL BUSINESS. IF THEY WERE TO OCCUR IN EXTREME UP AN EXTREME SITUATION THAT MODOC RESPECT WE ARE LOOKING AT EXTREMELY OBNOXIOUS. YEAH MUCH OF THE BUDGET THAT THEY GIVE TODAY DISCUSSED- REALLY REALLY LOOKS TO THINK ABOUT THAT LOOKING A STRATEGIC RESERVE TO- OTHER SUCH AS SUCH AN EXTREME TO. IN TERMS LONG TERM PLAN. AS YOU KNOW- WE THE TIME PLAN THAT IT. THROUGH AND IT HIGHLIGHTS AND I WILL I TO THEM. IN A MOMENT- AND ALSO WANTED TO OFFER THE PLANNING WE ARE CONTINUING TO LOOK AT- SCENARIOS. HI OF PETITIONS IN OPERATING APPROACH. THAT I WOULD LIKE TO REQUEST MY PROPERTY- ARGUED MILLER. YES THIS IS MARK ROSS FISHER- CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER AT THE CALIFORNIA ISO. AND I WILL REPEAT- MUCH OF THE MATERIAL THAT- VICE CHAIR GUNDA HAD ALREADY EXPRESSED I'LL FOCUS MY COMMENTS ABOUT THE TRANSMISSION PLANNING. AND IN THAT REGARDS THE TRANSITION PLAN THAT WE DEVELOP IT IS- ALIGNS WITH ULTIMATELY THE PROCUREMENT. ACTIVITY IN THE RESOURCE PLANNING THAT IS CONDUCTED THE CPUC- SO WE TRY TO KEEP UP WITH. THE TRANSMISSION NECESSARY TO SUPPORT THOSE RECURSOS RESOURCE PLANS. I THINK WE'RE IN AN EXTRAORDINARY- DYNAMICSTHE RIGHT NOW WHERE THE RESOURCE PLANS HAVE BEEN INCREASING YEAR OVER YEAR AND AS A RESULT OF THAT- THE TRANSMISSION PLANNING- TO SUPPORT THAT. HAS BECOME MORE CHALLENGING AN INCREASE IN THE FACT THIS LAST YEAR- WE APPROVED- ABOUT TWO POINT NINE. BILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF. ADDITIONAL TRANSMISSION- TO SUPPORT THAT INCREASING GROWTH AND WE EXPECT THAT TO INCREASE. IN THE COMING YEARS OF THE- RESOURCE PLANS INCREASE. AS WELL. I THINK IT IS THE SECOND POINT IS- WE CONDITIONALLY- LOOK OUT- IN THE FIVE TO TEN YEAR. PLANNING HORIZON- THIS PAST YEAR WE ALSO. LOOK OUT OVER A TWENTY YEAR OUTLOOK. TO ALIGN WITH THE CDC'S SB ONE HUNDRED- AND- AND IN DOING SO WE TRY TO PROVIDE SOME INSIGHTS INTO WHAT IS THE TRANSMISSION NECESSARY IN THE LONGER TERM- TO SUPPORT CONTINUE TO SUPPORT FOR. THE CLEAN ENERGY TRANSITION- THESE WILL BECOME ACTIONABLE AS THEY'VE KIND OF ROLL INTO MORE THE TENURE RISE AND WILL CONTINUE TO WORK TO ADAPT THOSE AND IDENTIFY THOSE OF LARGER. MORE SIGNIFICANT. PROJECTS THAT ARE NECESSARY TO KEEP THE TRANS ASIAN- MOVE FORWARD- SO THAT I WILL STOP IF THERE'S ANY QUESTIONS. I JUST THANK YOU FOR THOSE COMMENTS I WANTED I WANTED ON RECORD BECAUSE I THINK THAT. THERE'S A LOT OF FOLKS WHO DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT'S HAPPENING IN CALIFORNIA. CALIFORNIA RATE WE TALKED ABOUT THE DIRECTOR TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT. THE RATES. CALIFORNIANS PAY ALMOST A BILLION DOLLARS. IN RATES TO SHIFT POWER OUT OF OUR STATE BECAUSE WE OVER PRODUCED DURING CERTAIN TIMES WE HAVE A LOT OF WIND AND SUN- AND WE HAVE NO ABILITY TO TRANSPORT THE POWER TO PLACES IN CALIFORNIA WHERE WE NEED IT WE HAVE A HUGE TRANSMISSION PROBLEM IN CALIFORNIA AND- YEAH WE TALK ABOUT GETTING POWER WE WANT TO GO WE NEED TO DO IF THERE'S IF THERE'S ONE STATE OF EMERGENCY IT'S BUILT ENDING POWER LINES IN THIS IN THE STATE. TO GET THE POWER THAT WE OVER GENERATE TO THE PLACES THAT WERE UNDER GENERATED SO I WANNA GO ON RECORD AND WE TALK ABOUT I ONLY HEAR ABOUT HIS BATTERIES ARE GOING TO SAVE US. THEY'RE NOT. THEY'RE NOT SAVING US AT THE MOUNT OF POWER WE NEED TO ELECTRIFY OUR TRANSPORTATION. SECTOR AND ALSO POWER ARE. IN INDUSTRY IN OUR HOMES- WE CAN'T GET. PER PERMITTED FACILITY ANYWHERE IN THE STATE I MEAN. TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND MEGAWATTS COMING ONLINE I'D LIKE TO KNOW WHAT THE PROJECTION OF GETTING ONE OF THOSE PLANTS BUILT IN CALIFORNIA IN THE NEXT TEN YEARS. BECAUSE TEN YEARS AND DOLLARS WERE SUPPOSED TO MEET. OUR ELECTRIC VEHICLE MANDATE. AND SO I ACTUALLY USED TO BUILD POWER LINES AND BUILD POWER PLANTS WHEN I WAS YOUNGER. AND I ME TAKE SOME YOU DON'T JUST DO THAT OVERNIGHT. AND THE PERMITTING PROCESS IN CALIFORNIA SO ANTIQUATED THATFOR US TO GET WHERE WE WANT TO GO IS GONNA BE VERY DIFFICULT SO I WANT THIS COMMITTEE TO UNDERSTAND. AND THEN ON TOP OF THAT I WANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT AT LEAST- CANYON WHICH I DON'T ONE OF THE MEMBERS ON THIS COMMITTEE. REPRESENTS I BELIEVE- THEY'RE DROPPING THAT THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE USING THAT THAT IS THE STORAGE FOR. NATURAL GAS THAT RUNS PEAKER PLANTS WHEN YOU HAVE. HI HE AND- AND NEED ELECTRICITY SO WE HAVE NO ABILITY TO. PRODUCE ENERGY CALIFORNIA'S GONNA BE IN THE DARK. AND WE'RE GONNA SEE A LOT OF PEOPLE REALLY FRUSTRATED IN CALIFORNIA'S I WANT. I WANT AND WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT THIS WE DON'T TALK ABOUT. THE LONG TERM EFFECTS OF THE SHORT TERM PROBLEMS BECAUSE WE DON'T DO GOOD PLANNING AND- LOOKED UP THE ISO IS BEEN TALKING ABOUT. WHEELING POWER WE CAN'T WILL POWER IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF TRANSMISSIONS I KNOW THAT. SENATOR BACKER IS DOING A BILL ON TRANSMISSION WE NEED TO FOCUS ON THAT BILL WE NEED TO BUILD ALLOW CALIFORNIANS TO GET POWER WHERE THEY NEED IT AND DRIVE THE COST OF THE SAME TIME. SO THOSE ARE THE LASTING THE LAST THING I HAVE MISTER CHAIRMAN IS THERE'S NO WHERE IN THIS BUDGET. THAT I COULD FIND WHAT WE TALK ABOUT ACTUALLY. BUILDING WATER STORAGE- SITES RESERVOIR IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY THERE'S PLENTY OF MONEY IN THE BUDGET WE SHOULD FUND THAT PROJECT FULLY OUT OF OUR- OUT OF OUR SURPLUS AND BILL SITES RESERVOIR IT'S A GREAT PROJECT FOR. NUMBER ONE ENVIRONMENT AND ALLOWS THE DELTA OPERATED EFFICIENT WAY IT HELPS FISH HELPS KEEP US COLD WATER WHERE WE NEED IT. AND WE NEED WATER IN CALIFORNIA IF WE'RE GOING TO SEE- WHAT WE'VE SEEN A LOT OVER THE LAST COUPLE YEARS. WHERE WE SEE A LOT OF WATER FLOW BECAUSE THE TEMPERATURES ARE RISING AND ARSENAL BLACK PACK IS COMING IN RAIN- WE SAW THE OROVILLE SITUATION A FEW YEARS AGO WE SHOULD CAPTURE THAT WATER. INSIGHTS RESERVOIR WE'D HAVE IT FOR TODAY DO USE BUT THESE PROJECTS TAKE TIME AND WE NEED TO FUND THEM RIGHT NOW AND MOVE FORWARD THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN I THANK YOU FOR. ALL OF THE TO ROUND A CALL TO- ANSWER MY QUESTIONS I APPRECIATE IT DO WE HAVE A COMMENT ON THE SITES RESERVOIR AND WATER STORAGE- YES COMMENT- THANK SENATOR DON. WE AGREE SITES RESERVOIR CAN AND SHOULD BE AN IMPORTANT PART OF OUR SOLUTION MOVING FORWARD. CAPTURING WATER IN THE WAIT YEARS FOR USE IN YEARS LIKE WE'RE EXPERIENCING RIGHT NOW. I AM I AM PROUD THAT THE WATER COMMISSION HAS MOVED. OUT OF SEVEN OF THESE PROJECTS THAT WILL BE FUNDED BY OUR PROP ONE. A GENERAL OBLIGATION BOND. NOW WELL OVER TWO BILLION DOLLARS FOR STORAGE. THREE SURFACE STORAGE PROJECTS FOR UNDERGROUND WATER PROJECTS PROVIDING TWO POINT SEVEN. MILLION ACRE FEET OF STORAGE. I'M STATES IS MOVING FORWARD IT'S OBVIOUSLY THE LARGEST. A RESERVOIR OF ITS KIND IN A GENERATION SO IT HAS A NUMBER OF STEPS THAT IT HAS TO GO THROUGH. BUT WE'VE GOT A BIG SIGNIFICANT CHUNK OF PUBLIC FUNDING. I INTO THAT PROJECT. I AND THEN THE THAT MAY REVISION BUDGET ALSO CALLS FOR AN ADDITIONAL FIVE HUNDRED MILLION BUDGET YEARS- TO AUGMENT PROJECTS SUCH AS SITES. I'M SO WE DO NOT FEEL LIKE WE ARE GROWING. FOCUSED ON HELPING THAT PROJECT COME ONLINE AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. LAST POINT NOW I'M DIRECTED ME TO ENSURE THAT OUR STATE PROCESS THESE ARE WATER COMMISSION ISN'T- SLOWING DOWN THE PROGRESS OF GETTING THOSE PROJECTS ONLINE. AND SO WE'VE BEEN REALLY FOCUSED ON THAT AND HE'S RECENTLY DIRECTED US TO GO FURTHER THAN THAT AND WORK WITH THE SEVEN PROJECT TO IDENTIFY HOW WE CAN REMOVE BARRIERS TO ACCELERATE THOSE PROJECTS COMING ONLINE BECAUSE I THINK WE ALL RECOGNIZE WE NEED TO DIVERSIFY OUR WATER SUPPLIES. JUST THANK YOU FOR THAT COMMENT I JUST WANT TO. SAY WE HAVE NINETY SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS. AND WE SHOULDN'T JUST BE RELYING ON PROP ONE MONIES WE SHOULD PUT SOME OF THIS MONEY INTO THE- THE PROJECTS THAT'S AT ODDS ALL I'M SAYING I NEED THERE IF THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO SPEND ONE TIME MONEY. THIS IS THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO THAT WE SHOULD BE TALKING THAT WE SHOULD BE SPENDING THE MONEY THERE THAT'S ALL I'M TRYING TO. PUSH ON THE BUDGET IS TO PUT THE MONEY IN THERE. EVERY DAY THAT WE DON'T. PUT A SHOVEL IN THE GROUND. THE INFLATION IS DRIVING THESE PROJECTS. IN SOMETIMES DOUBLE THE PRICE AND SO. EVERY DAY WE WAIT IT'S GOING TO CONTINUE TO GO HIGHER. AND WE WON'T HAVE THESE MONIES ACCORDING TO THE L. A. IF BY TWENTY TWENTY THREE WE'RE GONNA SEE A DIP. IN THE KANEMI AND IT'LL BE FRUSTRATING TO NOT HAVE A PROJECT BUILT ONCE AGAIN AND RIGHT NOW IS THE TIME TO DO SO THANK YOU FOR THAT. I LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING EVEN MORE OF THE GENERAL FUND. AND A SURPLUS GOING TOWARDS THOSE PROJECTS THANK YOU. SAN REQUIRED HAVE QUESTIONS. THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER CHAIR I JUST GONNA PROVIDE JUST SOME COMMENTS- IN A DISAPPOINTED MOMENT SAY THANK YOU SO MUCH TO THE HAIR CARE WHAT KASKY FOR- HIS DUE DILIGENCE- HIS HARD WORK- IN HIS MANY YEARS OF COMMITMENT TO THIS PROCESS AND PEOPLE CALIFORNIAN ALSO WANT TO THANK YOU TO THE BUDGETS UP TO STAFF TEAM FOR ALL THEIR WORK- IN GETTING THIS TO US YOU KNOW THERE'S BEEN A LOT TO CRUNCH INTO THE ENTIRE SENATE BUDGET TEAM AS WELL. THE JUST GONNA BE DOING SOME COMMENTS AND I KNOW THAT WERE ALL SPIT BALLING ON SEVERAL ISSUES THAT ARE IN FRONT OF US- IN THERE IS A LOT OF WORK. TO CONTINUE. I'M GONNA START OUT. LIKE A BROKEN RECORD AS I WAS DOING TALK ABOUT WILDFIRE SEASON AND- LOOK MY BOTTOM LINE IS THIS WILDFIRE SEASON IS A THING OF THE PAST IN THE STATE- FIRES. ARE NOW- YEAR ROUND CHALLENGE. AND THEY'RE BURNING MORE INTENSELY. AND WE HAVE SIMPLY NOT STAFFED UP. TO MEET. THIS ERA OF MEGA FIRES. WE HAVE. IN WE ARE NOW IN THE WORST DROUGHT IN TWELVE CENTURIES. AND WHEN WE TAKE A LOOK AT THE PREDICTIONS FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY TWO YEAR AHEAD WE BURNED ALMOST ONE POINT FIVE MILLION ACRES ACROSS THE WEST- AND THAT'S FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES MORE. COMPARED TO THE TEN YEAR AVERAGE. SO PREDICTIONS FOR CALIFORNIA IT'S NOT LOOKING GOOD. IN WHILE I GREATLY APPRECIATE WHERE THE GOVERNOR THE SECRETARY- IN CHIEF TYLER HAVE ADVANCE IN THIS MAY REVISED IT'S SIMPLY NOT ENOUGH- IN I HAVE GREAT RESPECT. FOR SECRETARY CRAWFORD I WAS JUST SHARING WITH SENATOR STERN THAT HE IS ONE OF THE HARDEST WORKING IN STATE SERVICE. AND THE FIRE CREWS IN THE SUPPORT STAFF THAT ARE BEING ADVANCED IN THIS BUDGET DOESN'T BEGIN TO FIX THE SHORTAGE THAT WE SEE IN CALIFORNIA. IT DOESN'T. AND I AM GRATEFUL THAT WE'RE ADVANCING CONSERVATION CORPS CREWS IN STAFFING UP THE NATIONAL GUARD BUT LET'S JUST BE CANDID WE HAVE A CRISIS IN CALIFORNIA RANKS IN THERE ARE PROUD BUNCH THEY DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS THAT EXIST BUT THE FACT IS THAT WOMEN A MINUTE CAL FIVE WHO WERE DEPLOYED FORTY FIFTY SIXTY DAYS AT A TIME YEAR AFTER DAM YEAR AFTER DAM YEAR IT DOESN'T WORK ANY LONGER. AND THE ONLY WAY THAT WE'RE GONNA GET THROUGH THIS IS BY INVESTING. IN RELIEF IN THE WAY WE GET TO RELIEF IS BRINGING ON ADDITIONAL FIREFIGHTERS AND THAT IS NOT THE SILVER BULLET WE ALSO HAVE TO INVEST IN PREVENTION IS WELL- AND THAT'S WHY THE SENATE IS GOING TO INVEST. IN ENHANCED RESOURCES FOR PREVENTION BUT WE SHOULD BE DOUBLING THE NUMBER THE SIXTEEN HAND CREWS THAT WERE HIRED LAST YEAR WE SHOULD. BE BRINGING ON ADDITIONAL. RELIEF FULL TIME PERSONNEL TO STAFF UP FIRE ENGINES IT'S SIMPLY NOT ACCEPTABLE IN JUST GOING TO BE CANDID I KNOW YET AGAIN. FOR THE SEVENTH YEAR IN A ROW WILL BE STANDING ON A STREET IN A COMMUNITY THAT I PROBABLY REPRESENT WATCHING HOMES BURKE. ON THE PHONE IT TOO I AM THE CHIEF TYLER- IN BACON FOR RESOURCES IN THOSE RESOURCES SIMPLY WON'T BE ABLE TO COME BECAUSE THE WEST IN THIS STATE IS TAPPED OUT. AND WHY WE CONTINUE TO SOUND THIS ALARM YEAR AFTER YEAR AFTER YEAR AND NOT INVEST. IT BLOWS MY MIND. IN JUST BEING CANDID ABOUT IT I'M SICK OF HEARING. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE COME IN FRONT OF THIS COMMITTEE AND TALK ABOUT. WHAT THEY'VE DONE IT'S SIMPLY NOT ENOUGH IT'S NOT ENOUGH. IN WHY WE SIT HERE FRIEDGEN ACCEPTING THIS. RIDICULOUS ANSWER THAT WE SIMPLY HAVE ENOUGH STAFFING A CAL FIRE IT JUST BLOWS MY MIND AND YOU CAN TELL I'M INCREDIBLY FRUSTRATED AND IT'S SUPER PERSONAL FOR SO MANY OF US BECAUSE WE ARE SEEN OUR COMMUNITIES. LITERALLY BURNED DOWN. SO NOW SINCE TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT STAFFING UP IN WE SIMPLY DON'T DO IT WE DON'T DO IT. SO I WE'RE GONNA NEED TO CONTINUE TO PUSH- THE SENATE HAS ITS PLAN- IT'S IN THE BUDGET AND AGAIN THESE ARE JUST MY OWN COMMENTS ON ASKING QUESTIONS BECAUSE HONESTLY I DON'T WANT TO HEAR. THE ANSWERS BECAUSE IT'S THE SAME ANSWER THAT I HEARD LAST YEAR AND THE YEAR BEFORE THAT SO THAT'S WHY I'M JUST OFFERING COMMENTS AND I'M NOT GOING TO SWITCH TO THE ISSUE OF FIRE PREVENTION. SO ON FIRE PREVENTION- AGAIN WE CAN'T DO ONE WITHOUT THE OTHER RIGHT WE HAVE TO STEP OFF THE CALFIRE CALIFORNIA WE ALSO HAVE TO STEP UP FOR WILDFIRE PREVENTION. THE WHERE THE SENATE WANTS TO GO IS THE ONE THING FIVE BILLION PLUS A SIX HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE MILLION FOR CONSERVANCIES. I THINK THAT IS SMART IN WHAT WE LEARNED FROM LAST YEAR WITH CONSERVANCIES- WE ARE ABLE TO GET THAT MONEY OUT QUICKER- AND I THINK THAT IS A WINNING. MODEL THAT WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD WITH. I ON THE ISSUE SALMON- REALLY GRATEFUL FOR THE HUNDRED MILLION THAT THE GOVERNOR IS PROPOSING. FOR SALMON. A TO BE A PROTECTED SPECIES FROM TOTAL COLLAPSE. I WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT TO SAY THANK YOU TO. DIRECTOR BONHAM DR BONHAM HAS BEEN ON THIS LIKE A HAWK- AND WE'RE ALSO GONNA NEED ADDITIONAL DETAIL FOCUSED. ON THE SPECIFICS ON HABITAT RESTORATION WATER WAY ENHANCEMENTS. IN I KNOW THAT WORK IS STILL TO COME- IN AGAIN JUST WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO AFTER AFTER BONTA FOR HIS WORK ON THAT. JUST JUMPING- I'M ALMOST DONE HERE AND MISTER CHAIR IN REGARDS TO THE SENATE A CLIMATE PROPOSAL AGAIN- AND I AM SURE THAT WE'RE GOING TO HEAR FROM SENATOR STERN IS WELL ON THIS. ISSUE AND GRATEFUL FOR HIS LEADERSHIP ON THAT A LITTLE CHAIRED BY CAL SKI IS. THE REASON WHY THE SENATE IS GOING BIG AND- ADVANCING THE MOST AGGRESSIVE CLIMATE ACTION BUDGET IN THE UNITED STATES THIS YEAR IT'S BECAUSE OF THE LEVEL CRISIS THAT EXISTS IN OUR COMMUNITIES. THAT'S WHY WE ARE LOOKING AN ADDITIONAL THREE POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS WHEN IT COMES TO SEA LEVEL RISE IN PREPARING OUR COMMUNITIES FOR SEA LEVEL RISE IN LOOKING AT MANAGED RETREAT. WHY WE'RE LOOKING AT A BILLION DOLLARS TO INVEST FOR THE FIRST TIME ONE BILLION DOLLARS IN COMMUNITIES- THE MOST VULNERABLE TO THIS KIND OF CRISIS. DID MANAGE COMMUNITIES. THAT'S WHY IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT MONEY BUT DEVELOPING THE INTERIM TARGETS TO BE ABLE TO HIT OUR TWENTY FORTY GOALS THAT IS. REALLY CRITICAL BECAUSE HONESTLY WE'RE NOT WE ARE HERE TWENTY FORTY GOALS UNLESS WE BENCHMARK THEM HERE IN THE YEARS TO COME. AND THEN ALSO. IT BEEN A LOT OF DISCUSS. ABOUT THE POWER GREAT I THINK WE'RE GONNA BE SHORT ABOUT FOURTEEN TO SEVENTEEN HUNDRED MEGAWATTS. POTENTIALLY THIS COMING SUMMER AND FALL WHICH IS ALARMING. AND THAT'S WHEN THE SENATE IS GOING TO BE ADVANCING A PLAN. TO BE ABLE TO GET NEW GREEN POWER EIGHT POWER GENERATION FACILITIES ONLINE FASTER WITH THE SEVEN YEAR PLAN FOCUSING. ON INDUSTRIAL SOLAR OFFSHORE WIND ON CHARLIE ENTRE NGUYEN IN. DEVELOPING ADDITIONAL COMMERCIAL GEOTHERMAL PLANTS WHICH IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL. FINALLY IN JUST SOME THANK YOUS AS WELL ON CANNABIS- GRATEFUL AND I KNOW WE'RE NT FOCUSING ON THIS IN THIS COMMITTEE. AGAIN WE COMMUNITY THAT GENERATES. ABOUT TWO THIRDS OF THE CANVAS IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. YOU'RE WELCOME- BUT- BOTTOM LINE IS THIS THE TAX REFORM THAT WE NEED ON THE CULTIVATION SIDE- IS CRITICAL GRATEFUL THAT THE- ADMINISTRATION- DIRECTOR ELLIOTT- FROM BEER CANS CONTROL GOVERNMENT NEWSON. IS FOCUSING ON THIS BUT I ALSO BELIEVE- WE'RE GOING TO NEED TO CONTINUE INVESTING ADDITIONAL LAW ENFORCEMENT PRESENCE WE ARE WE'RE STAFFING UP BUREAU OF WITH ABOUT TWENTY POSITIONS OF ADDITIONAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS JUST BEING HONEST. IT'S BEEN CHALLENGING TO BE ABLE TO HIRE ON FISH AND WILDLIFE HAS BEEN AN INCREDIBLE PARTNER WITH A LOCAL SHERIFF'S OFFICES. BUT TO BE ABLE TO HELP STABILIZE THE MARKET. WE HAVE TO FOCUS ON WHERE THE- I'M LICENSE UNPERMITTED CANNABIS PRODUCT IS COMING FROM AND THERE ARE LITERALLY TENS OF THOUSANDS OF ACRES IN THE STATE. THAT HAVE BEEN POINTED WITH UNLICENSED UNPERMITTED CANNABIS- MMHM. MANY OF WHICH ARE TAKING FROM- STREAMS THAT ARE IMPAIRED BY THE DROUGHT OR STRAINS THAT HAD ENDANGERED SPECIES. AND WE WERE ABLE SECURE ABOUT ONE POINT FIVE MILLION IN THE BUDGET LAST YEAR FOR LOCAL SHERIFF'S OFFICES TO TAG TEAM WITH- THE BUREAU ALONG WITH FISH AND WILDLIFE TO BE ABLE TO GO IN. TO ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS. ON THESE ON LIGHT. FARMS I THAT OUR THREAT THE SPECIES IT'S A AS TAKEN FROM IMPAIRED WATERWAYS. IN WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO DO MORE OF THAT HAD TO BE ABLE TO ASSIST FISH AND WILDLIFE PLUS OUR LOCAL SHERIFF'S OFFICES. IN THAT ONE POINT FIVE MILLION CANDIDLY IS A DROP IN THE BUCKET. COMPARED TO WHAT WE SEE ACROSS THE STATE ESPECIALLY. THE NORTH STATE LASTLY MISTER CHAIR I WANT TO SAY A FEW THANK YOUS. TWENTY ONE TO SAY THANK YOU TO CHAIR ASK ABOUT- ASK ABOUT AND HIS TEAM. AT THE DEPARTMENT HAVE BEEN ACTIVE IN ENGAGE THROUGHOUT THE STATE NOT FOCUSING ON THIS DROUGHT CRISIS- HE FOCUSES ON LARGE COMMUNITIES IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. AND A SMALL COMMUNITIES IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA- AND TAKING A VERY STRATEGIC APPROACH IN THAT. AND TAKE ANY WORSE FOR STRATEGIES THAT YOU'RE ASKING I JUST WANT TO SAY THANK YOU FOR THAT. YOU KNOW THAT THERE'S A LOT MORE WORK TO COME. ALSO DID DIRECTOR BONHAM UP FOR HIS WORK ON ALL ISSUES A SALMON AND FINALLY ON SECRETARY. SECTOR CROWFOOT- YOU ASK- THIS GENTLEMAN WHAT'S HAPPENING IN SENATOR STERN SISTER CREE ASKING WHAT'S HAPPENING IN SENATOR DOLLY SISTER T. AS HIS FINGER ON THE PULSE. HE'S ACTIVE HE'S ENGAGED- AND ARE GRATEFUL FOR THE WORK ON THAT. AND LOOK FOR THE SCENE- THIS BUDGET NEGOTIATIONS. ON COME TO FRUITION AND WORKING ON GETTING SOME ADDITIONAL CHARACTERIZATIONS- INTO. THE BUDGET IS WELL THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU SENATOR SINISTER. YEP M. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN. AND IT PRESHEAF THE TESTIMONY FROM THE ADMINISTRATION- AND THAT IN NO WAY DO I CONSIDER THIS THIS HEARING YOUR SWANSONG MISTER CHAIR BECAUSE- WE HAVE A SERIOUS NEGOTIATION ON OUR HANDS TO ENGAGE IN AND THE HISTORIC BUDGET SURPLUS TO WORK ON AND I THINK- THEIR THEIR RISKS. OF UNDER DOING IT WHEN IT COMES TO CLIMATE WHETHER IT'S FIRE WATER NATURE BASED SOLUTIONS ENERGY. ARE ARE SIGNIFICANT- I'LL MAKE SOME COMMENTS AND I HAVE A JUST A COUPLE QUESTIONS- I WANT TO ECHO AS A SOUTHERN CALIFORNIAN WHOSE DISTRICT IS ON FIRE AT THE SAME TIME MY BROTHERS HERE TO THE NORTH. AND THEIR COMMUNITIES WERE ALSO ON FIRE THAT. WE'RE ONE FAMILY WHEN IT COMES TO FIREFIGHTING. AND THE CONCERN I HAVE ABOUT THE CURRENT BUDGET PROPOSAL AND THE LACK OF INVESTMENT IN CREWS- IS THAT. BY FAILING TO INVEST DEEPLY NOT ONLY IN IN THE CALIFORNIA RANKS BUT ALSO IN THE RANKS OF OUR CONTRACT COUNTIES. ESPECIALLY THOSE THAT ARE INVOLVED ARE JOINT JOINT USE AGREEMENTS- THE FOLKS WHO ARE THERE TO FLEX WHEN NEEDED. I THINK OF OUR L. A. COUNTY TEAMS THAT WENT NORTH TO FIGHT IN PARADISE THE SAME I'M AT THEIR BACKYARD WAS A FIRE BECAUSE WE SIMPLY DIDN'T HAVE. THE WOMAN AND MAN POWER TO ADDRESS IT- I HAVE DEEP CONCERNS ABOUT THAT AND I THINK WE CAN I THINK WE CAN WE CAN ADDRESS IT. I SEE IT IN THE SENATE'S BUDGET PROPOSAL- I THINK WE NEED A ROBUST PACKAGE AND I LOOK FORWARD TO ENGAGING WITH THE ADMINISTRATION ON THAT URGENT ISSUE- AND THIS IS GOING TO HAVE TO BE. AS THE SECRETARY WELL NOTED INVESTMENT PEOPLE. T IT'S NOT YOU CAN'T JUST DO WITH INFRASTRUCTURE ALONE- BUT I THINK IT'S WELL WORTH IT- I'LL SAY ON ON WATER- YOU KNOW THE WORK CURRENTLY UNDER ZERO ALLOCATION IN LARGE STRETCHES SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WITH THE THAT ARE DEPEND ON THE STATE WATER PROJECT. AND THE CONDITIONS ARE TO BE. QUITE DIRE SPECIALLY IN FIRE COUNTRY- FIRE IS GROWING IN A LACK OF WATER- IS A VERY VERY BAD FORMULA AND- I DID HAVE A QUESTION POTENTIALLY I THINK FOR D. W. R. ON ON SORT OF HOW THAT ALLOCATION FITS IN WITH THE BUDGET PROPOSAL HERE. BUT MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT- UNDER THE UNDER THE CONTRACT THAT D. W. R. HAS- WITH AUTO ON STATE WATER PROJECT THAT. THAT THERE IS AN ALLOWANCE FOR HEALTH AND SAFETY CONDITIONS LIKE EXTREME FIRE RISK AND YET NONE OF THOSE HEALTH AND SAFETY CONDITIONS ARE CURRENTLY IN THE ALLOCATION- JUST BROKE BEFORE I ASK YOU WHAT THE BUDGET NEXUS TO IT DO I HAVE THAT. THAT ACCURATE THAT FIRE ZONES HAVE NOT BEEN RECOGNIZED IN THE- IN THIS ZERO ALLOCATION. I DON'T KNOW IF THIS NAME IS THERE ANYONE FROM HER TEAM A D. W. ARE STILL. IS SENATOR I BELIEVE WE HAVE SEEN THE- MESSNER WHO IS THE CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE W. R. TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION BUT IF SHE'S NOT. ABLE TO COME ON SCREEN I WILL DO MY BEST TO ANSWER THAT. THANK YOU THE BILL. MORNING SECRETARY THIS IS TED CRADDOCK A SERVICE THAT YOU DIRECTOR FOR THE STATE WATER PROJECT. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION SENATOR. FROM OUR STATE WATER PROJECT ALLOCATION IS CURRENTLY 5% OF FOR THE CONTRACTORS TO RECEIVE WATER. IN ADDITIONALLY WE'RE PROVIDING HEALTH AND SAFETY WATER TO. A FEW OF OUR CONTRACTORS THAT HAVE ADDITIONAL NEEDS FOR HUMAN. HEALTH AND SAFETY SO HOPEFULLY THAT ANSWERS THE QUESTION. BUT THOSE THE HEALTH AND SAFETY ALLOCATIONS DO NOT INCLUDE- THE AREAS I REPRESENT. RIGHT DIDN'T THAT MET REGIONS I MEAN I DON'T KNOW WHAT WHAT AREAS YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT BUT MY UNDERSTANDING IS THERE'S NO ACCOMMODATION FOR HIGH FIRE SEVERITY ZONES ALL THROUGHOUT THE SOUTH LAND IN THAT ALLOCATION IS THAT TO HAVE THAT ACCURATE I'M THINKING OF AREAS. IN D. W. P. K. A GUESS LOS VIRGINIS- I MEAN THOSE ARE THAT'S MY BACKYARD I'M SURE THERE ARE MORE SANTA CLARITA. THE OF A SENSE. YEAH THE- WHAT WE'VE ASKED FOR IS FOR OUR CONTRACTORS TO IDENTIFY WHETHER THEY HAVE ANY HEALTH AND SAFETY NEEDS. BEYOND THE 5% WATER ALLOCATION PROVIDED. AS ON THE CASE THE METROPOLITAN WATER DISTRICT THEY HAVE REQUESTED ADDITIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY WATER THAT THAT WE ARE PROVIDING. A TO THAT DISTRICT WHICH IS THEN DISTRIBUTED TO THE RETAILERS AND THEIR THEIR SERVICE AREA. OKAY LOOK I'LL FOLLOW UP THEN ON THAT- AND MAYBE JUST TRY TO GET A LITTLE MORE GRANULARITY ABOUT WHAT TO EXPECT BECAUSE I THINK WHAT WHAT PEOPLE ARE WORRIED ABOUT I MEAN THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE WHO SERVE APPROACHING THIS DROUGHT. SELFISHLY IN JUST SAYING I WANT MY- YEAH I WANNA HOLD ON TO MY- MIKE. BECAUSE MEDIC. BECAUSE MEDICALLY INTERESTED AND WHETHER IT'S A LONGER- YEAH THE BOUGAINVILLEA. BUT I THINK FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT INTERFACE WITH THE WILL BE- WE'VE GOT SERIOUS COMMUNITY BENEFITS THAT WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT AND SO IF WE LET. THOSE ASSETS DIE OFTEN WE LOSE OUR OAK WOODLANDS OR WE LOSE THE INTEGRITY OF OUR- OF OUR CHAPARRAL ON THE HILLSIDES. THAT WE'RE NOT ONLY GONNA HAVE A LOT MORE FUEL ON OUR HANDS BUT WE'RE ALSO GOING TO HAVE- POTENTIAL- EROSION MUD SLIDE ISSUES IN THE LIKE SO LOOK FORWARD TO ENGAGING ON THAT- MIGHT MY WATER QUESTION. BEYOND THAT IN IN THE BUDGET CONTEXT IS- ABOUT THE RECYCLED WATER BUDGET AT I SEE HERE- HUNDRED MILLION. IN THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL FOR WATER RECYCLING- AND- I KNOW THE SENATE HAS. I THINK- BILLION DOLLAR PROPOSAL ON THAT FRONT. AND I'M WONDERING JUST IN TERMS OF HOW FAR YOU EXPECT- WATER RECYCLING GROUNDWATER CLEAN UP TO GO AND HOW FAST WHAT'S THE- WHAT HOW SHORT ARE WE GONNA BE IN TERMS OF OVERALL. PROJECT NEEDS OUT THERE WITH THE WITH THE CURRENT PROPOSAL IN THE REVISED. I CAN TAKE PART OF THAT SENATOR- I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT THE HUNDRED MILLION IS FOR GRANTS AND ANOTHER WAY THAT WE FINANCE A LOT OF THESE WATER RECYCLING PROJECTS IT'S THROUGH THE STATE REVOLVING FUND. THERE I THINK OVER JUST THIS LAST YEAR WE'LL HAVE COMMITTED ABOUT ONE POINT SIX BILLION TO WATER RECYCLING PROJECTS THAT'LL CREATE ABOUT SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND ACRE FEET A YEAR OF NEW SUPPLY SO THAT'S THE IF THE WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE FOUR HUNDRED MILLION THAT'S BEEN REQUESTED. FOR THE STATE MATCH FOR THE STATE REVOLVING FUND THOSE COULD BE CONSIDERED AS WELL- IMPORTANT DOLLARS FOR WATER RECYCLING WHEN IT COMES TO WHAT YOU KNOW THE POTENTIAL NEED IS OUT THERE. THERE'S A LOT AND WHEN IT COMES TO- GRANTS- YOU KNOW IF IT IS THEN YOU KNOW THE COMPONENT THAT HELPS WITH AFFORDABILITY BUT SO DO THE LOANS THAT STATE REVOLVING FUND. CAN PROVIDE WHICH ARE YOU KNOW HOW THE BOND RATE WHICH FOR ME AT THE SIGNIFICANT PROJECTS BUT THEY CAN COST HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS- IT CAN BE A SIGNIFICANT SAVINGS TO AFFORDABILITY AND COMMUNITY ITSELF. JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE AND FLAGGED- THAT OF THE PROJECT IS A PROPOSED. POSSIBLE BEHIND- THIS PRINT THESE PROJECTS BEING DEPLOYED AND WE KNOW THE- YOU KNOW THE UPGRADE POTENTIAL- JUST TAKE ONE WATER RECYCLING PLANT- CARSON OR HYPERION WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. FIVE TO SIX BILLION DOLLAR PROJECTS AND THAT'S JUST FOR- THE SOUTH LAND ALONE SO I KNOW THE NEED IS HUGE I KNOW YOU'RE WELL AWARE OF IT- BUT I WOULD LOVE TO SORT OF GET A SENSE OF HOW FAR WE EXPECT BOTH WITH THE COMBINATION OF THE REVOLVING FUND. AND WITH THE GRANTS- A QUICK YOU KNOW SORT OF IN PROPORTION A NEEDS ASSESSMENT I THINK WOULD HELP TO SET SOME EXPECTATIONS BECAUSE THIS TO ME SEEMS LIKE A- REALLY SMART YEAR. TO BE GOING BIG ON THAT KIND OF WATER RESILIENCE INFRASTRUCTURE SO- LOOK FORWARD TO FOLLOWING UP THERE. WHAT WHILE I HAVE YOU A CHERISHED KABEL I WANTED TO A PIVOT TO ENERGY BRIEFLY- IT MAY SEEM ODD THAT I WOULD BE. ASKING YOU I ALSO. I THINK THE QUESTION ALSO GOES SOMEWHAT TO D. W. R. BUT- YOU KNOW WE HAD A DISCUSSION. I THINK IT WAS LAST YEAR AND EVEN THE YEAR BEFORE THAT- AROUND- THIS SORT OF ONE TIME EXTENSION OF ONCE THROUGH COOLING- GAS PLANTS AROUND THE STATE. AND AS WATER CHAIR MY CONCERNS WITH THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF EXTENDING SOME OF THESE ALREADY OUTDATED- COMPONENTS OF OUR FLEET I'M TRYING TO GET A SENSE HERE AND I'M NOT SURE. WHICH PARTY MINISTRATIONS BEST TO ASK THIS BUT- IS THERE AN INTENTION WITH THE STRATEGIC ELECTRICITY RELIABILITY RESERVE- TWO WEEKS FURTHER EXTEND THE LIFE OF. OF THOSE KINDS OF GAS PLANTS AROUND THE STATE. THANK YOU SENATOR AND YOU KNOW HOW WE HAVE AN INSTRUMENT KNOWN AS IRAQ GROUP KNOWN AS A SACK WITH WHICH IS OUR- A GROUPING OF ALLIES SO ON THE ENERGY COMMISSION. IF YOU SEE AND THEY- HAVE GATHER AND CONSULT UP TO THE BOARD WHEN UP AND FLAG WHEN POTENTIAL CHANGES WILL WILL. AB I THINK AT THIS POINT WE'RE WAITING OR- SOME SIGNAL AND CONVENING FROM THE SOUTHWEST TO DOUBLE TO LET THE BOARD KNOW OUT WHAT. I REQUEST MAY BE COMING TO THEM TO HELP FACILITATE I KNOW WHAT R. I. ENERGY CHALLENGES. THAT- HAVE BEEN SPOKEN ABOUT. THANKS FOR THAT. AND MAYBE I COULD TURN TO I THINK. MAYBE W. R- OR THE OR THE ENERGY COMMISSION- YEAH IT LOOKS LIKE THE DVR FOUR POINT TWO BILLION AND- AND THEN THE ENERGY COMMISSION WHICH IS PLAYING A REALLY IMPORTANT NOT JUST DEPLOYMENT ROLE BUT ALSO PLANNING FUNCTION. IN ENSURING THAT NO THROUGH THIS RELIABILITY CHALLENGE THAT WERE ALSO- ACCELERATING OUR OUR CLIMATE GOALS I THINK WE CAN DO BOTH. I DON'T THINK IT'S A CHOICE BETWEEN- YOU KNOW INCREASE EMISSIONS ENDS FURTHER SETTING OURSELVES BACK IN OUR OUR SCOPING PLAN TARGETS. AND MEETING RELIABILITY AS WE SAW DURING THE EXTREME HEAT EVENTS- AND THE FIRES THAT RELIANCE ON CENTRALIZED BASELOAD GAS PLANTS AS TEXAS DID THROUGH THEIR EXTREME WEATHER EVENTS WAS ACTUALLY A- BAD STRATEGY- WE HAD OVER HEATING. WE HAD TRANSMISSION LINE CONSTRAINTS AND YET THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF MEGAWATTS THAT I UNDERSTAND ARE IN THE PIPELINE EITHER IN DEMAND RESPONSE. THROUGH THIRD PARTIES OR OR THE I. O. U.'S BUT ESPECIALLY THROUGH THIRD PARTIES AND AS WELL AS THE- THE SOLAR. AND OTHER SORT OF FLEXIBLE ASSETS THAT MAY BE BOTTLE NECKED- AND HAVE SOME RISK IN THE PIPELINE GIVEN THE- THE. THE LARGER. THE FINANCIAL FACING- THE SOLAR STORAGE COMMUNITY FROM FROM SOME OF THE FEDERAL INQUIRIES UNDER WAY- FTC IN OTHER INVESTIGATIONS OF SORT OF CAST TO. A BIT OF ANXIETY OVER THE INVESTMENT CLIMATE AND I WONDER IF WE CAN DO ANYTHING- TO ACCELERATE DEPLOYMENT THERE IN A WAY THAT DOESN'T COST THE TAXPAYERS MUCH BUT SIMPLY DE RISKS THE- THE PROJECT DEPLOYMENT SO IF WE'RE THINKING ABOUT. NO SEE THERE'S TWO THOUSAND MEGAWATTS OF- COMMUNITY SCALE- STORAGE AND SOLAR- IS THERE FLEXIBILITY WITHIN THE STRATEGIC ELECTRICITY RELIABILITY RESERVE TO- TO SORT OF. D. RISK THAT DEPLOYMENT AND I'M TALKING A MATTER OF MONTHS TO GET THOSE KINDS OF PROJECTS ONLINE BECAUSE BUILDING A HIGH VOLTAGE TRANSMISSION LINE WILL TAKE YEARS IS CENTER DOLLY RIGHTLY NOTED BUT THESE PROJECTS WILL TAKE MONTHS AND THEY'RE IN LINE IT JUST SOUNDS LIKE- WE NEED TO JUST FIND A WAY TO. MAKE THEM GO SO I JUST WANTED TO GET A SENSE FROM WHOEVER THE ADMINISTRATION SORT OF TAKING THE LEAD ON. THAT RESERVE WHAT THE WHAT THE OVERALL INTENTIONS ARE- EXTENDING GAS MORE ABOUT TRANSMISSION OR- OR SORT OF DOUBLING DOWN ON ON CLEAN ENERGY TO MEET THOSE NEEDS. YEAH I THINK SENATOR STERN IN A MOMENT I'LL TURN TO COMMISSIONER- AND- FROM THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION AND YOU RIGHTLY KNOW IT IS A PARTNERSHIP OF OUR INDEPENDENT SYSTEM OPERATOR RCP U. C. I CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION AND OF COURSE DEPARTMENT WATER RESOURCES GIVEN. IT TAKES A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF ENERGY TO MOVE WATER AROUND THE STATE. I WILL KNOW THAT YOU KNOW PREVIOUS ACTIONS TO ADDRESS THIS CRITICAL PRIORITY OF MAINTAINING RELIABILITY. YOU INCLUDED UNDER WHICH I THINK WE ALL RECOGNIZE IS A LARGE PART OF THE FUTURE- EMERGENCY GENERATION. AND ACCELERATING. BUT COMMISSIONER GUNTER CAN YOU JUST BECAUSE THIS IS THE FIRST TIME WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE RELIABILITY RESERVE I THINK WITH THE SUBCOMMITTEE CAN YOU TO BACK UP AND EXPLAIN ITS PURPOSE AND THEN THE SENATOR STERN'S QUESTION- TALK ABOUT SOME OF ITS CORE COMPONENTS. THAT YOU ANTICIPATE INCLUDING. THANK YOU AT CRAWFORD I THANK YOU SENATOR FOR THE DETAIL QUESTION- THANK YOU FOR CREATING IT. OUT SO THAT ONLY SO I THINK I JUST WANNA. FIVE STARTED THE TOP AND IT JUST KIND OF TALKING ABOUT THE- ENERGY TO LIABILITY. AND THAT KIND OF AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE AND SECURING ENERGY RELIABILITY. DURING THE- TRANSITION. SO HAVE NO FRANKLY SPEAKING IN OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS. THE CHALLENGES THAT EXPEDIENCY ING- ARE. REALLY EXTREMELY LARGE AND- YOU BELIEVE IT. THANK YOU KNOW THE YOU KNOW HEAT WAVES THE COOPER. HAVE I THINK READING DEMAND BEYOND THE MUCH BEYOND THE PLAN ASSUMPTION YOU KNOW CURRENTLY- ARE LOOKING GUY. A RECORD LEVEL TO DEBATE IN IN HYDRO CONDITIONS AND IT COULD BE SOMETHING LIKE A BOOK LIKE WILDFIRE. THAT COULD KNOCK OUT ABOUT FOUR THOUSAND MEGAWATT TRANSMISSION COMING INTO CALIFORNIA. THE SERVER LOAD SO WE'RE LOOKING AT THIS- POTENTIAL OF ALL THE THINGS CONVERGING. AS WE MOVE PARTNER THE EXPLODING THAT TOO AND I'M PRESS. LEVEL OF RELIABILITY CHALLENGE. SO AS WE THINK THROUGH THEN ADDED A MEDIATION OF THAT- YOU KNOW LOOKING AT THE GOT PROPOSAL- PROPOSAL IS ABOUT. I DON'T HAVE BILLION. FOR THE OVERALL STRATEGIC RESERVE COMPONENTS. AND THE RESERVE HAS TO BE KIND OF THING THROUGH. AT THIS POINT IN THAT THE AGENT COULD COME. TO THROUGH. WE HAVE A NEED FOR. ENSURING A LARGE AMOUNT OF MEGAWATTS CAN QUICKLY COME ONLINE SAID THAT THE- IF THE A FUNCTION OF THESE RESOURCES THAT WE COULD BRING IT TO THE STATE. OUR IT'S ALSO THE- IN WHICH WE DEPLOY THEM. I'M RESOURCE GUIDE WITH THE- SO THAT WE NOT. INHIBITED BY SUPPLIES ISSUES ON A- TYPE. AND ALIGNMENT WITH STATE AND PRIOR. AS WE THINK. AND ALSO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO LEVERAGE FEDERAL FUNDING. SO WHEN WE LOOK AT THAT- TALAGA. THE TO TWO H. IN A WE HAD A AT. QUICKLY RAMPING UP ITS FIFTY RESERVE. AND THAT MIGHT NOT- THREE. SOME THE ASSETS THAT ARE- LOOKING TO RETIRE. BUT MODERNISED THE THERE IN. THANK SO THAT REMOVED HIM OF THE MY PLACE. YOU'RE NOT TREATED IF THE NEED FOR THE STRATEGIC. BUT LOOKING AT SIXTY HOURS A YEAR ROUGHLY SIXTY HOURS A YEAR. AND THAT'S REALLY WHEN YOU HAVE THE WALLET. OF BOTH INCREASED. AND THE INTERSECTION OF POTENTIALLY MANY TIED TO OF AB THAT WHOLE. AND FIX THAT OF OUR OF RESOURCE CURRENTLY A BILL. AND IT'S GOOD DEAL TODAY. BUT BUILT IN THE CON OF THE LAW. PRIORITIES CAN BROUGHT THIS. RESERVE AT THE WEIGHT US TO HOLD A TO THINGS. ALL THERE INCLUDING AT THE END BACKUP GENERATOR THAT ARE. WE COULD HAVE PUT IN SOME- AND THAT THE BUDGET HAS MONEY FOR CLEANING COMING DIESEL ADDS THAT INCENTIVES. AND INCREASING AMOUNT OF CLICK. THAT WE COULD. EXPLORE SO OVERALL THE STRATEGY WOULD BE GIVEN THAT THE LARGE GAP THAT WE'RE OBSERVING. COULD BE QUICKLY THEN CLAMPED UP WITH WHAT RESOURCES WE QUICKLY BRING ON. IN A COST EFFECTIVE MANNER BUT AS WE GO INTO THE NEXT FIVE YEARS OF CONTINUE TO. EXPAND THE STRATEGIC RESERVE AND I THINK IT TO THE ADEQUATE D. AS OTHER POLICY PRIORITIES SHAPE UP WE CAN THINK THROUGH- YOU KNOW EXPANDING THAT INTO CLEAN. FIVE TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THAT WE DO NOT WANT TO INTERFERE. WITH THE PROCUREMENT OF THE UTILITIES SO WE WANT TO UTILITIES TO CONTINUE. MOVING FORWARD ADEQUATELY TO WORK THE SB ONE HUNDRED GOALS IN THE IN THE- IN PROCURING THE CLEAN ENERGY SOURCES. AND WE GIVE THEM THE FREEDOM TO DO SO BY ALLOWING THE FIFTY TWO COULD THERE BUT THE INSURANCE. THAT'S COMPRISED OF A BROAD. PORTFOLIO OF WITH CLEAN AND TRADITIONAL WITH THE I. TWO WORDS HOW QUICKLY CAN WE BUILD AT A COST EFFECTIVELY BE CAN BE BUILT AND PROVIDE FOR. OUR NEEDS THAT. THANK YOU FOR THAT MISS OF A CHAIRED. SAID JUST TO. TRY INTERPRET YOUR- IT'S A LIKE. THERE SOME NEAR TERM INTO. TO LEAN ON. A VARIETY OF ASSETS BUT BUT CERTAINLY- EXPANDING THE USE OF GAS AND GOING BEYOND SAY THE ONCE THROUGH COOLING RETIREMENT TIMELINES DOES NOT SOUND LIKE IT'S OFF THE TABLE IN FACT SOUNDS LIKE IT'S VERY MUCH ON THE TABLE AND- AND PART OF THE PLAN IN THE NEAR TERM IS THAT IS THAT FAIR TO SAY. FOR THIS COMING YEAR. AT YES SENATOR. OKAY THANK- ARE ALL I WOULD SAY ON THAT NOTE IS THAT. I WOULD JUST ASK THAT I KNOW THAT A PIECE OF THIS PUZZLE IS ALSO THE AT WITH THE ENERGY COMMISSION. IF THERE'S IF THERE'S ANY WAY TO. TO LOOK AT SORT OF A PRIORITIZATION FRAMEWORK AS YOU LOOK THROUGH IT FOR THOSE KINDS OF ENERGY RESERVES. THAT ARE GOING TO MEET OUR CLIMATE GOALS AS WELL. TO PUT THOSE- YOU KNOW SORT OF. WITH WITH A RISK ADDER ON TOP RIGHT WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT. WHAT WHAT ACTUALLY ISN'T RELIABLE ENOUGH- TO MEET THESE DEMANDS. I WOULD JUST ASK THAT- YOU YOU ALL CONSIDER- SOME KIND OF CLIMATE FILTER. THAT PLAN- THAT ALSO LOOKS AT SPEED- BECAUSE I THINK THAT. AS I SAID I THINK THERE'S ABOUT TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED MEGAWATTS. IN THE PIPELINE OF. OF ASSETS THAT DON'T REQUIRE ANY SUBSIDY THAT ARE ALREADY BEING PLANNED AND FOR DEPLOYMENT AROUND THE STATE. WITH CLEAN STORAGE WITH SOLAR- THAT SHOULD BE FLEXIBLE ENOUGH FOR IT TO BE USEFUL TO THE AYE SO AS WELL AS TO D. W. ARE SO. HOPE YOU OAK CONSIDER THAT AND HAVE SOME KIND OF PRIORITIZATION FRAMEWORK SO THAT. WE DON'T SORT OF SET OURSELVES BACKWARDS HERE BUT I DO RECOGNIZE THE UNIQUE CHALLENGE WE'RE FACING AND- APPRECIATE. YOU KNOW THE ENORMOUS PRESSURE THE ADMINISTRATION'S UNDERSIDE THINK YOU'RE SMART TO GET. AHEAD OF IT AND- AND I WOULD JUST SAY THAT YOU KNOW A GOOD CLIMATE STRATEGY IS OUR BEST REAL RELIABILITY STRATEGY SO- I APPRECIATE THAT. THE ONLY OTHER THING I WANT TO ECHO WAS JUST- ON WHEN IT COMES TO. ABOUT FIRE PREVENTION AND NATURE BASED SOLUTIONS OF THESE READ. POLLUTION'S I WANTED ECHO MIKE MY COLLEAGUES IN THE NORTH- WE'VE SEEN TREMENDOUS OUTPUT FROM. BOTH THE B. C. B. AS WELL AS OUR CONSERVANCIES AND WOULD LOVE TO SEE YOU MINISTRATION. AND KEEP LOOKING AT AT THAT END OF THE SAID PLAN IS. GOT A VERY ROBERT FRAME ON THAT FRONT AND I THINK THE MONEY'S BEEN ABLE TO BE PUSHED OUT THE DOOR VERY QUICKLY. BOTH ON FIRE PREVENTION AS WELL AS ON- ON SOME NATURE BASED CLIMATE SOLUTIONS THAT SHOULD HAVE SOME. A VERY VALUABLE NEAR TERM IMPACTS SO I HOPE YOU ALL WILL- WILL CONSIDER THAT BUT I DO APPRECIATE JUSTIN IN THE VERY NEAR TERM- NOT NOT WINNING IN YOUR COMMITMENT ON. ON THE BIODIVERSITY RISKS THAT THIS DROUGHT AND FIRE CONDITIONS ALSO FACING. TO DOUBLE DOWN A WILDLIFE CORRIDOR. AND REALLY NOT STOPPING AT LIBERTY CANYON WANNA COMMEND SECRETARY CROWFOOT FREEZE IT INCREDIBLE LEADERSHIP ON THIS FRONT AND IT'S VERY EXCITING TO HAVE THE GOVERNOR DOWN HERE DISTRICT TO DO THE LARGEST. WILDLIFE QUARTER PROJECT IN THE ENTIRE WORLD- BUT I'M I'M TRYING NOT TO GET TOO ENAMORED WITH IT BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT ONE QUARTER ITSELF WILL NOT SOLVE THIS ISSUE. AND SO I APPRECIATE JUST THE CONTINUE LOOK TO THE FUTURE TO TRY TO- LOOK TO THOSE SORT OF BIODIVERSITY RISK HOT SPOTS AROUND THE STATE. AND PRIORITIZE THAT AND YOU KNOW DIRECTOR BOTTOM AND YOUR ENTIRE TEAM INCLUDING CHECK CALTRANS JUSTIN. INCREDIBLE SO THANK YOU FOR THAT WORK AND LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUE CONVERSATION. THANK YOU I'M- ENERGY COMMISSION ROOM WATER RESOURCES LET'S STAY WITH ENERGY FOR A WHILE BECAUSE- I'VE GOT A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS. I GUESS UNLESS CENTERS DURIN'S QUESTION DIFFERENTLY ON THE- SIR THX ELECTRICITY RELIABILITY RESERVE WHAT'S NOT IN. WHAT'S NOT INCLUDED IN THAT BECAUSE THE PARAGRAPH I GOT I GOT EVERY EXISTING NATURAL GAS PLANT DIABOLIQUE DABBLE CANYON ANY NEW RESOURCES THAT MAKE CAN'T COME ON NOT A LOT OF INFORMATION AND HOW THAT MAY BE ACCELERATED THIS SIR ANYTHING THAT'S NOT. INCLUDED. AND THANK YOU AS CHAIR- JUST A JUST FUNDING TO YOUR COMMENT DIRECTLY ON THE STRATEGIC RESERVE I THINK THE GOAL OF THAT IS THERE WOULD BE. DOES THE RESOURCES THAT ARE DISPATCHABLE WHEN WE NEED THEM SO THAT WOULD NOT GENERALLY INCLUDE LARGE- BASED BASED POWER SUCH AS DIABLO SO AT THIS POINT WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THE STRATEGIC RESERVE WE'RE THINKING ABOUT PUTTING TOGETHER. A PORTFOLIO RESOURCES BUT IT COULD BE A CONTRACTED AT THE SOURCES. WHAT THE PREVIOUS ALREADY NEEDED TO PROCURE OR THAT HE SOURCES THAT WE MIGHT- BUT NEW STILL IN THE GROUND APPLE ARE KIND OF HOLDING ON TO CONTACT THE DOCTOR IT'S A PRETTY LARGE- WE WOULDN'T WE WOULD LOVE TO HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY. TO BE ABLE TO ORGANIZE OURSELVES INTO AFTER THEIR STORES POINT DOUBLE OF A DISPATCH. IN CONSULTATION BUT WITH THE CARD ON HOW BEST TO ORGANIZE AT THE FLIGHT DISPATCH OF THE RESOURCES. IN GENERAL I THINK UNTIL THE RESOURCES THAT ARE LARGE- BASELOAD RESOURCES WOULD NOT BE WHAT WE WOULD THINK OF FOR A STRATEGIC RESERVE HAVING SAID THAT- I RECOGNIZE- YOU KNOW THE GOVERNOR I TALKED ABOUT- PUTTING ALL THE- OPTIONS ON THE- TABLE. OUT FOR- FOR. AT PUTTING TOGETHER THE RELIABILITY AND EXECUTING THE LIABILITY AND IF YOU KNOW IF YOU KNOW SOMETHING LIKE THE OUTLOOK AND YOU WILL BECOME- OR OR OF THIS AND FIND I DO KNOW THAT WOULD BE A DISCUSSION. WITH THE LEGISLATURE. LOOKING FOR. SO I GUESS ONE OF THE MAIN. FOR A HUNDRED TO SUPPORT. TO CARBOMER COMMISSION MISS WHAT PROVIDING MATCHING FOR WE KNOW THE GOVERNMENT'S HASN'T WORK OUT THERE. IF WE IF WE'RE GOING TO ALLOW SOME OF THESE BERNIE- OR POLLUTING PEAKER PLANTS ARE OLD NATURAL GAS FACILITIES TO STAY ONLINE FOR RELIABILITY WOULDN'T YOU WANT TO INVEST MORE MONEY ON LET'S SAY NEW NATURAL GAS FACILITIES THAT MAY BE TAKE ADVANTAGE OF CARBON CAPTURE OR SOME BIO FUELS ARE SOME OTHER THINGS. JUST AS A INSURANCE POLICY ON THE CARBON GAME IF WE'RE IF WE'RE TRYING TO BALANCE OFF WITH OKAY THESE REAL BILL WE HAVE A PLAN TO TAKE THEM OFF LINE BUT IF WE- AND I THERE'S PEOPLE WON'T LIKE THAT BUT BUT FROM A CAR ANALYSIS WOULD YOU WANT TO. PUT SOME MORE MONEY IN THERE SO PEOPLE FEEL A LITTLE LESS ANXIOUS. SINCE SINCE MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT A NATURAL GAS FACILITY IN ORDER TO CARBON CAPTURE THEY DON'T GET ANY CREDIT UNDER CAP AND TRADE AND IT'S FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS TO DO THE PROJECT AND- A HUNDRED MILLION OR EIGHTY MILLION FOR A BIO MASS. AND THEY GET THEY DON'T GET THE REDUCTION OF CARBON. IT I'M I'M LOOKING FOR SOME BALANCING AGENT HERE WITH AT WITH. FIVE POINT TWO BILLION ONE HUNDRED MILLION. NO THANK. THAT CHAIR FOR THE QUESTION- I WILL DEFER TO- ARE. ON THE CALL FROM HE TO X. THE INTENT OF THE AND ALL- FOR A CARD TO WEIGH IN ON THE ON THE BROAD. QUESTION YOU HAD AROUND- THE CARD IN A BASEMENT- IN MARKET STRUCTURE. VIRGINIA. INSERTING YOU REPEAT THE QUESTION AGAIN. PHYLOGENY COULD YOU PLEASE EXPLAIN- THE INTENT FOR THE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR AFFECT YEAH I GUESS YOU HAVE A VICE YOU'RE GOING TO THE IDEA THAT IF WE'RE GOING TO. INVEST IN CONTINUE WITH THESE- ARM FOR RELIABILITY SOME OF THESE POLLUTING HEAVY POLLUTING FACILITIES IT AT THE TUNE OF FIVE POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS WHICH WE NEED FOR REAL RELIABILITY LET'S ACCEPT THAT YOU HAVE A HUNDRED MILLION TO SUPPORT CARBON RENEWAL PROJECTS WHICH SEEMS LIKE. A MAYBE ONE BIO FUEL PLANT THAT WOULD GET A GRANT THAT WOULD HAVE WOULD REDUCE THEIR CARBON AND IF WE'RE GOING TO HAVE SOME ADDITIONAL RELEASES REGARDLESS OF ALL THE OTHER STUFF WE DID WOULD YOU WANT TO PUT A HIGHER INVESTMENT WHY AGAIN IT'S FOUR HUNDRED MILLION TO DO OCCUR- OF NATURAL GAS PLANT WHATEVER THE NEW NATURAL GAS PLANT IS THAT WOULD GET TO. AT LEAST REDUCE THE CARBON THAT WE EXPECT TO COULD BE ON THERE WHEN WE NEED THE ENERGY FOR A BALANCING HER THE GREAT. I'M HEARING. ON ALL OKAY THANK YOU FOR YOUR KIND OF HIGH LEVEL QUESTIONS. I WILL KIND OF START WITH THAT BONTA NOTE ON TO MY COLLEAGUE VIRGINIA SO I THINK THAT YOU MAKE A VERY IMPORTANT POINT ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF KEEPING THE OPTIONS OPEN AND ESPECIALLY PROVIDING OPPORTUNITIES YET TO BE A PART OF THE POWER SECTOR OUR CONVERSATION I WOULD LIKE A VIRGINIA TO LAY OUT THE INTENT FOR THE HUNDRED MILLION. AND I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE. A CALL BACK ON THE ON THE BROADER QUESTION THANK YOU. OKAY SO- SO THIS HUNDRED MILLION IS FOCUSED ON AREN'T DETERRED. TECHNOLOGY FOR DIRECT- CARBON CAPTURE. OF CO TWO FROM THE ATMOSPHERE. AND WHAT SIX MAKING BOLD EFFORT- AGGRESSIVELY- CARBON WE RECKON THAT. THAT WE'RE GONNA- OPEN IN ORDER THE CHEESEBURGER- GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION GOALS. AND THE HUNDRED MILLION FOCUSED ON DIRECTOR CAPTURE BECAUSE NEEDED TO REDUCE THE AT AND WE CAN DO TO LIVEHE RESIDUAL MISSION THE NEEDS TO BE CONTINUED TO BE A BETA THAT CAN BE OF THE THROUGH- NORMAL PROCESSES INTO THIS COULD BE THE LEGACY FIELD EMISSIONS THAT NAME. AFTER WE DO OUR ENERGY EFFICIENCY- INTO- NO POINTS WERE SCORED CAPTURE AND. THESE OTHER THINGS. AND THIS. TO HELP TO YOU REDUCING AND ACCELERATE. AFTER AIR CAPTURE TECH SO THAT WE CAN REDUCE THE COST AND THE ENERGY INTENSITY AND OPERATING EFFICIENCY. AND TO THE FRONT OF USED TO SUPPORT- FIVE RESEARCH- HOTEL AND HIGHLAND BEACH. AND TESTING OUT OF NEW- TECHNOLOGIES TO BETTER UNDERSTAND. THE COSTS AND ALSO DEFINED WAYS ON HOW TO REDUCE. THE ENERGY YOU AND OPERATING EFFICIENCY. AND- SO YOU KNOW WE'RE HOPING THAT THE FUNDS WILL BE USED TO ALSO HELP OFF SUPPORT ANY FEDERAL FUNDING THAT COULD BE COMING- THE- AND THE AFTER STRUCTURE AND JOBS ACTORS ABOUT. THREE AND A HALF BILLION FOR DIRECTOR CAPTURES HOPING THAT FUN OFFICE EACH YEAR TO CALIFORNIA BY- SOME OF THE BILLION TO PROVIDE COST YEAR. NOTES THAT. AND THE- AND ALSO TO PARTNER OTHER PROJECTS THAT ARE ON ALSO- YEAH WORKING ON THE RESTORATION PART HIS A FORTY FIVE TAX CREDIT. AND OTHER- PROJECT. OKAY SO WHAT WE WOULD MAYBE SENATE ADJOURNMENT BECAUSE HE DOES. A PERFECT CRAWFORD JUST JUMP AT THE HIGH LEVEL THIS MILL DOLLAR ISRAEL FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE. CAN TO LEE INNOVATION WHICH IS MAKING THIS INVESTMENT IN DIRECT AIR CAPTURE TECHNOLOGY CAPTURES CARBON FROM THE AIR TURNS IT INTO AN INERT SUBSTANCE AND WE THINK IN THE FUTURE AS WE MOVE TOWARDS CARBON NEUTRALITY WHICH OF COURSE IS OUR KEY GOAL. IT'S GOING TO BE REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT. THAT STRATEGIC RELIABILITY RESERVE IS ALL ABOUT ENSURING THAT WE MAINTAIN ENERGY RELIABILITY IN THE SHORT TERM AND THAT WE HAVE RESOURCE AS THIS COMMISSIONER POINTED OUT TO- DISPATCH AT ENERGY AS WE NEED IT AS WE'RE EXPERIENCING THESE UNPRECEDENTED HEAT STORMS. BUT MAKE NO MISTAKE OUR GOAL OUR TARGET OUR COMMITMENT IS CLEAR WHICH IS NOT A 100% I CARBON FREE ENERGY AND ULTIMATELY CARBON- NEUTRALITY. I IN SO THIS HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS WE THINK IS AN IMPORTANT INVESTMENT RELEASED STAND UP- AND ACCELERATE THIS DIRECT AIR CAPTURE TECHNOLOGY AND THEN AS MISS LOU POINTS OUT MAJOR FEDERAL FUNDING- THAT WE CAN ATTRACT INTO CALIFORNIA- WE THINK THROUGH THIS INVESTMENT. RIGHT I JUST I'LL I'LL GET TO THE LITHIUM VALLEY DEVELOPMENT NEXT BUT BUT THE ONE OF THE ONE OF THE TENANTS THAT YOU HAVE THERE IS TO ACCELERATE DEVELOPMENT OF STREAMLINING THE PERMITTING- AND WE DON'T HAVE THAT IN THE CARBON CAPTURE AND- THEN I GET. IN WE KNOW THAT DIRECT AIR CAPTURE IS THE CADILLAC VERSION I GUESS WE SEE THE LEXUS VERSION NOW AND THAT'S VERY EXPENSIVE BUT THERE'S ALSO NATURE BASE DRUM- A CARBON CAPTURE THERE'S ALSO THE GOOD OLD FASHIONED YOU KNOW YOU GOT A FACTORY GOT IN INDUSTRY YOU CARBON CAPTURE IT YOU. YOU YOU SINK IT INTO. EXISTING WELL AND I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH SOMEBODY AT THE AT THE VARIOUS DEPARTMENTS HE'S GOT A NOTE. THAT IN THE WORST CASE SCENARIO- IN THE SUMMER WE GOT ALL THESE PLAN ON EXTENDING THE LIFE OF THE NATURAL GAS AND THERE'S GOING TO BE. A COSTS TO THE TO THE AIR QUALITY AND SO IF WE IF WE PUT OF A HUNDRED MILLION INTO DEVELOPMENT OF A DIRECTOR CAPTURE LET'S JUST SAY WE BUILD IT WE CAN ALSO KNOW HOW MUCH CARBON THAT'S GOING TO. PUT DOWN AND I'M JUST SUGGESTING THAT YOU MIGHT WANT TO LOOK AT MORE MONEY FOR A VARIETY OF CARBON CAPTURE IF WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO KEEP THESE. POLLUTING FACILITIES OPEN YOU KNOW FOR A LONGER TIME A WEEK IT'S- A IN THE SHORT TERM AND SHORT TERM BECAUSE SOME OF THESE PEOPLE WANT TO. WANT TO. DO THAT- WE'LL GET TO THE ADULT. THEY'LL REMAIN LET'S GO TO. THE SALTON SEA AND THE LITHIUM- VALLEY I THINK THE L. A. YO. CAN YOU HELP ME OUT HERE DO WE HAVE. SETH KERSTING ON THE ON THE LINE- I'M TRYING TO FIND FIGURE OUT THE- HOWEVER THIS IS GOING TO WORK THIS THE STATE IS GOING TO DO- EXCISE TAX. OR PLACE FI RE. ON THE EXTRACTION AND WE'RE-NOT GOING TO ALLOW LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO DO THAT AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO GIVE MONEY BACK TO THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS I'M SURE I BOTCHED THAT UP- BUT- I DON'T SEE. A LOT CAN YOU HELP HOLD MY HAND AND EXPLAIN IT MISTER CHRISTIAN- SURE THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR SAID CHRISTINE WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE SO WOULD BE- TRAILER BILL LANGUAGES. IS NOT YET- AVAILABLE FOR THIS STUDY WERE SURE OF GOING OFF A COMBINATION OF THE DESCRIPTION IN THE- BUDGET SAY IN THE MEMBERS SUMMARY DOCUMENTS AND ALSO SOME SOME BRIEFINGS THAT WE'VE HAD WITH THE ADMINISTRATION- ARE UNDERSTOOD THIS IS A PROPOSAL THAT HAS A VARIETY OF- COMPONENTS- ARE I DIDN'T DEPART YOU'RE DESCRIBING IS ONE OF THE WHAT WE DO IS SORT OF THE CENTRAL COMPONENTS THAT WE HAVE- I STARTED TO TAKE A LOOK AT. WHICH IS- SENSUALLY AS WE UNDERSTAND IT TO PROHIBIT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS FROM IMPOSING TAXES ON LITHIUM. EXTRACTION AND INSTEAD TO IMPOSE A STATE TAX ON LITHIUM EXTRACTION- AND THE- DAY THE RATE FOR PROPOSED RATE HAS NOT YET BEEN- SPECIFIED- AND SO. YOU KNOW IN DISCUSSIONS WITH THE ADMINISTRATION OUR UNDERSTANDING IS SORT OF THAT THE MAIN ARGUMENT FOR DOING THIS IS THAT- IT WOULD HELP THE INDUSTRY EXPAND IN PART BY PROVIDING CERTAINTY ABOUT THE TAX POLICIES THAT WOULD APPLY TO. LITHIUM EXTRACTION- AND THERE'S SORT OF A FURTHER ARGUMENT THAT THE STATE SHOULD ACT NOW DUE TO POTENTIAL LOCAL ACTIONS LATER THIS YEAR PERHAPS IMPOSING LOCAL TAXES. I AND CERTAINLY IN SOME SITUATIONS ON CERTAIN LOCAL POLICIES CAN DISCOURAGE PRIVATE INVESTMENT WHICH COULD JUSTIFY PREEMPTION BY THE STATE BUT IN THIS CASE. ARE YOU MINISTRATION HAS NOT PRESENTED SO FAR ANY EVIDENCE IN THE THAT POLICY UNCERTAINTY IS WEAKENING INVESTMENT IN THIS INDUSTRY. IT'S NOT CLEAR WHY THE STATE WOULD BE BETTER POSITIONS TO COMMIT TO FUTURE POLICIES THUS PROVIDING CERTAINTY- MORE SO THE LOCAL GUY- IT IF AS THE ADMINISTRATION SEEMS TO ANTICIPATE- A LOCAL ACTIONS ARE CURRENTLY NEAR FUTURE. AT EVERY EARLY SO AT THE INDUSTRIES DEVELOP THAT'S IN LIKE IT SHOULD CREE MORE. NOT LESS AND FINALLY THERE IS THAT THE STATE WOULD FIRST HAVE A SENSE OF WHAT YOU PROCREATE TAX RATE WOULD BE MORE SO THAN LOCALS. BUT BECAUSE THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL DOESN'T INCLUDE TAX RATE- THAT SEEMS SORT OF LIKE A QUESTIONABLE PREMISE AT THIS IME AND THEN A REVISION TIMELINE DOESN'T PUT THE LEGISLATURE IN A POSITION TO COME UP WITH ITS OWN TAX RATES SO THAT'S JUST OUR COMMENTARY ON THAT MAIN PIECE. OF BUT THERE ARE OTHERS AS WELL AND- IT AND IF YOU'D LIKE TO DISCUSS THIS ANYBODY WITH THE ENERGY COMMISSION OR FINANCE HAS A COMMENT THAT MANY SPEECH AT. SOME LIGHT ON THIS. YEAH IS IT A MINUTE WOULD. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- THE LIBYAN TAX BECAUSE ON UNFORTUNATELY WAS A LITTLE BIT SLOW BUT WILL BE UP TODAY AND FOR ALL THE LANGUAGE WILL BE OUT THIS WEEK WHICH WILL IDENTIFY THE TAX RATE- BUT- LARGELY THE STATE'S STEPPING IN HERE IN ORDER TO ACCELERATE THIS INDUSTRY- ARE PARTNERING WITH THE FEDS IS WHILE IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE THAT- THIS STATE CAN REALLY TAKE ADVANTAGE. OF WHAT IS NOW BEING CALLED KIND OF SAUDI ARABIA LITHIA- I HAVE BECOME TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION THIS WEEK ON THE- TAX RATE. IT'S BEEN PROPOSED. OKAY I SEE I SEE THAT WHINY XCELERATED LITHIUM AND NOT ACCELERATE LATE SEE YOU- BIOMASS AND WOODY PRODUCTS IN IN OUR FORCE WE'VE GOT YOU KNOW WHAT TO STUDIES TO COME OUT THAT WE NEED TO MAKE AN INVESTMENT INTO THESE FACILITIES PROVIDE CERTAINTY THAT WOULD. WHAT PRODUCTS WOULD COME IN AND YOU KNOW X. DEVELOPMENT OF BY STREAMLINING THAT- THAT THE PERMITTING PROCESS WE GOT TWO HUGE PROJECT PROBLEMS WE GOT TOO MUCH WOOD PRODUCTS WE GOT A LOT OF THINGS YOU WANT TO DO BUT WE GOT TO GET IT OUT. OF THE- OF THE FORCE WHY NOT FROM AN ENERGY POSITION WHY NOT. HAVE SOME SORT OF. PROGRAM LIKE THAT. IT TAKES CHAIR AS SECRETARY GRAVERT HERE YEAH I THINK IT'S ACTUALLY NOT A FOR ITS AND SO ON LITHIUM VALLEY WE RECOGNIZE THAT CALIFORNIA HAS ALMOST THIS UNIQUE RESOURCE IN THE WORLD THAT WE NEED TO MEET OUR CLEAN ENERGY GOALS THAT CAN REALLY LIFT UP THE REGION. AND WE THINK THIS IS A TREMENDOUS OPPORTUNITY TO DO IT RIGHT IN A WAY THAT ACTUALLY NOT BUILD MORE ECONOMIC ACTIVITY IN CALIFORNIA FOR THAT THE BATTERY SECTOR AND THAT CLEAN ENERGY SECTOR IN A WAY THAT BENEFITS FOLKS THAT LIVE IN THE IMPERIAL THE COACHELLA VALLEY AND OF COURSE I ALSO BENEFITS SALTON SEA RESTORATION THAT'S ONE PIECE. I ABSOLUTELY AGREE THAT WE NEED TO DO MORE TO STAND UP ECONOMIC ACTIVITY ACROSS OUR LANDSCAPE IN OUR FORESTS ACTUALLY GET THE- VEGETATION OUT OF OUR FORESTS THAT ARE BEING- ADDRESSED OR OR THIN THROUGH THIS ECOLOGICALLY BASED FOREST MANAGEMENT AND FRANKLY WHILE THE PUBLIC INVESTMENTS ARE REALLY ROBUST HUGE THANKS TO YOU ALL- WE NEED MORE PRIVATE ECONOMIC ACTIVITY SO WE ARE WORK TO STREAMLINE. FOR PROJECTS AND WE MADE A SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS WITH A LARGE PROGRAM WE CALL THE VEGETATION TREATMENT PROGRAM- PROGRAMMATIC ER WHICH IS A MULTIPLE AND I CAN I CAN DETAIL THAT BUT THE SHORT OF IT IS WORKING TO GET THESE PROJECTS DONE MORE QUICKLY AND COST EFFECTIVELY AND THEN ALSO AGAIN THANKS TO YOUR INVESTMENTS LAST YEAR INVEST IN- IN GROWING SECTORS FOR THESE PRODUCTS. AND WE OBVIOUSLY HAVE. A TIMBER INDUSTRY THAT. THAT IS NOT A GOOD IN CALIFORNIA AND THERE'S ALSO THE BUT FOR USE OF THE VEGETATION THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY PART OF THAT INDUSTRY. I THROUGH THINGS LIKE CROSS LAMINATED TIMBER SO THERE'S A LOT OF INVESTMENTS THROUGH PARTNERS LIKE INFRASTRUCTURE BANK WHICH ARE HERE TODAY WHO ARE HERE TODAY- TO ACTUALLY STAND THIS UP SO WE NEED TO DO BOTH. WE NEED TO. ACCELERATE OUR SECTORS TO HELP US MANAGE OUR FORESTS AND LANDSCAPES AND WE THINK WE NEED TO ACCELERATE- SMART LITHIUM DEVELOPMENT. OKAY OKAY I GUESS. MISTER REAL YOU HAVE SOMETHING THAT. I DON'T THINK- GOOD MORNING CHAIRED THE NEXT CAREER WITH THE ENERGY COMMISSION I COULD SPEAK A LITTLE BIT MORE TO THE ISSUE OF WITH HIM IF IT- PRISONS- COMMITTEE. YEAH SO I WOULD I WOULD SHARE THAT AS WE KNOW- LITHIUM IS BECOMING AS CREDIBLE INCREASINGLY CRITICAL RESOURCE FOR THE STATE AND THE WORLD AS WE MOVE TOWARD CLEAN ENERGY FUTURE TO TACKLE THAT BECAUSE I'M A ARE GOING TO TRY TO PRESENT ABOUT WE ESTIMATE THAT ABOUT A THIRD OF TODAY'S GLOBAL LITHIUM THAT MAN COULD POTENTIALLY BE UNDER THE SOLVENCY THIS IS A CRUCIAL INDUSTRY THANKS FOR THE STATE TO SUPPORT MUCH LIKE WE SUPPORTED EASY- INFRASTRUCTURE AND GROWTH IN THE STATE. THE BATTERY IN THE TECHNOLOGY AND THE FACT ECOSYSTEM AROUND THAT WILL BE- INCREASINGLY CRITICAL FOR OUR GROWTH THAT. THE CLEAN ECONOMY. OKAY I'M LET'S SWITCH TO THE P. SEE I KNOW YOU HAVE A- READ. A PROPOSAL IN THE AND- THE MAY REVISE I DIDN'T SEE ANY TRAILER LANGUAGE I GUESS MY QUESTION IS DID. IS TO ADDRESS ELECTRICITY RATES TO PREDETERMINED FIXED CHARGES. ISN'T THAT CONTROVERSIAL I MEAN THIS IN LOW INCOME PEOPLE HAVE A HAVE A HARDER TIME PAYING A FIXED RATE AND A HIGH INCOME PERSON. I MEAN- IT'LL SEND A PRICE SIGNAL THAT I CAN I WILL AGREE I'LL STIPULATE TO THAT. IT DOESN'T ABUSE HE HAVE DISABILITY NOW. GO AHEAD. MISTER BAKER. YEAH HELLO SENATOR- BEST PC HAS AUTHORITY TO- APPROVED RESIDENTIAL FIXED CHARGES- THEY A LECTURE BEST AROUND UTILITY UP TO A CERTAIN STATUTORY CAP AT THIS POINT. AND SO WE HAVE SOME AUTHORITY TO DO THAT. BUT WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS THAT CUSTOMERS OF THE ELECTRIC VALUE THIRD RANKING RATE PRESSURES. DUE TO WILDFIRE RELATED TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION COSTS AMONG OTHER FACTORS AND CURRENTLY MOST ELECTRIC ARE YOU FOR ARE COLLECTED THROUGH CHARGES. AND THAT CREATES. AN ECHO ACROSS RECOVERY- ESPECIALLY FOR THOSE CUSTOMERS THAT CAN'T AFFORD TO REDUCE THEIR CONSUMPTION- THROUGH DISTRIBUTING YOUR RESOURCES ADOPTION AND WHAT HAVE YOU AND SO HI BIOMETRIC CHARGES THEY ALSO CREATE A BARRIER TO ELECTRIFICATION. AND DEATH RATE REFORM PROPOSAL WOULD ALLOW THE FEW KEY TO REDUCED CHARGES. ATTACHED TO VOLUMES OF ELECTRICITY CONSUMED IT WOULD ALSO ELP TO CONTROL RATE VOLATILITY. AND ENABLE I HAVE A BETTER PRICE SIGNALS TO ENHANCE THE WIDESPREAD ELECTRIFICATION EFFORT YOU. YOU ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT IT. THIS PROPOSAL CONTROVERSIAL. YOU SEE HOW THEY THAT PASSED FEBRUARY WHAT ARE SECOND HEARING ON THAT MATTER OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS AND WE'VE BEEN REPORTING ON THAT TO THE LEGISLATURE THROUGH OUR SB SIX NINETY FIVE REPORT. AND WE OBSERVE THAT RESIDENTIAL FIXED CHARGE RATE REFORM WAS. AMONG THE STAKEHOLDER PROPOSALS THAT APPEAR TO HAVE. BEEN BROAD SUPPORT- ACROSS A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT STAKEHOLDER GROUPS. AND SO WE SEE THAT THAT- I KEEP STRATEGY FOR OPENING UP OPPORTUNITIES- FOR. FURTHER PARTICIPATION BY CUSTOMERS AND IN- ELECTRIFICATION OPPORTUNITY AND WE'RE ALSO PROPOSING TO- AND THAT- STATUTORY CHANGE DIRECT THE PUBLIC UTILITY COMMISSION TO INCORPORATE- AT IN AND INCOME TAX INCOME FACTOR IN AND HOW- ANY- FIXED CHARGES ARE ARE STRUCTURED. IT WOULD ALSO BRING THE- ELECTRIC- I'LL YOU UP MORE IN LINE WITH WHAT WE'RE SEEING- ELSEWHERE IN THE INDUSTRY. CURRENTLY CALIFORNIA'S ELECTRIC I USE THAT ARE- ONE OF THE FEW ELECTRIC UTILITY. OFF THE COUNTRY THAT DON'T HAVE BIG CHARGES- IT'S VERY COMMON ANOTHER INDUSTRY AND- FOR EXAMPLE THAT SACRAMENTO MUNICIPAL UTILITY DISTRICT HAS A- TWENTY DOLLAR PER CHARGE AND I THINK THAT THE COURT HAS A SEVEN DOLLAR. CHARGE AND SO- THAT WAS- THE PURPOSE IS TO- PROVIDE MORE FLEXIBILITY THAT THE PUBLIC UTILITY COMMISSION TO BE ABLE TO CONSIDER THIS ISSUE RIGHT OKAY ONE MIGHT WE ARE EXPECTED BUDGET TRAILER BILL TO EXPLAIN THIS IN. A GREATER DETAIL OR LANGUAGE FORGET THIS LANGUAGE YOU HAVE AN IDEA HI JERRY THIS IS M. IN OUR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND EXPECTING IT TO BE UP THIS WEEK EXCELLENT BECAUSE WE DO YOU KNOW WHICH WE SEE ONE POINT TWO BILLION TO PLAY ELECTRIC ARREARS WHICH IS ACCEPTABLE WHEN WE WANT TO DO THAT BUT THEN WE'RE GOING TO RAISE THE RATES GOING FORWARD YOU CAN SEE WHY SOME MEMBERS MIGHT. BE CONSIDERED CONCERN I MISS ELLERS AND WHOEVER'S AT THAT- ALLEY- I GOT A QUESTION ON THE CAP AND TRADE- YOU HE- I KNOW THERE'S AN AUCTION TOMORROW- IT SEEMS LIKE PRICES ARE GOING UP IN THAT THAT. IN GAS- IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE THAT WE DON'T. RECEIVE OVER A BILLION DOLLARS IN DEBT I'M ON THE NUMBERS AGAIN THIS IS MY SEVENTH YEAR IS SEAT CHAIR NOT MY SIX YEARS THAT YEAR SO EVERY YEAR WE HAVE THIS DISCUSSION ABOUT WHAT THE ANTICIPATED REVENUE AS AN- IN. AND MY UNDERSTANDING WERE ABOUT SIX HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS LESS OR ABOVE WHAT THE GOVERNOR'S MAY REVISE- HAS EVEN THOUGH WE KNOW WE'VE GOTTEN THREE POINT FOUR BILLION ALREADY IN FROM THE THREE OCT. OPTIONS YOU HINTED AT. AT THE- GANN LIMIT OF LIMITATIONS AND HOW CAP AND TRADE MAY BE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR SOME OF THESE- PROPOSALS THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS- THAT MAY NOT BE CAPITAL INVESTMENTS- THEY HAVE TO A FARM- THE SATELLITE- METHANE SATELLITE IN THE AND ALSO MORE MONEY FOR AB SIX ONE SEVEN WHICH IS AYE IT I'M INTRODUCTION MARKS INDICATED THAT THAT DOESN'T REDUCE METHANE AT ALL IT JUST TELLS US PRECISELY WHERE IT IS WHICH IS VALUABLE. BUT YOU KNOW WE MIGHT WANT TO START SPENDING SOME MONEY ON REDUCING METHANE SO CAN YOU HELP ME. OR GIVE GIVE THE LEGISLATURE SOME GUIDANCE ON HOW WE MIGHT BE LOOKING AT OUR EXPENDITURE PLAN VIS A VIS SAID THE SALT LIMITED AND ALSO SOME OF THESE- PROPOSALS THAT REALLY. DON'T REDUCE THE THANK A CAR. SIR MARKET SHARE AND AGAIN PASSES TO MY COLLEAGUES BROWN. HELLO MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS ROSS BROWN WITH LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE SO I'LL FINISH NOT GOALS ARE THE FEW PIECES OF THAT QUESTIONS SO FIRST ON THE- YOU MENTIONED JUST SORT OF THE REVENUE ESTIMATES AND MY CALLING IS EHLERS MENTION THIS IN HER COMMENTS WE DO- THAT MAY REGION DOES INCLUDE SOME ADDITIONAL DISCRETIONARY FUNDING TO ACCOUNT FOR. THE MOST RECENT AUCTION- INCREASES KIND OF THEIR JANUARY PROPOSAL FROM ABOUT ONE BILLION TO ABOUT ONE POINT ONE BILLION. BASED ON OUR REVENUE ESTIMATES WE DO THINK THAT THE LEGISLATURE COULD- COMFORTABLY ALLOCATE A ROUGHLY FIVE HUNDRED MILLION MORE THAN THAT IT'S GOING TO CURRENT PRICES CONTINUE OVER THE NEXT YEAR SO THAT'S- WANT TO ADD A COMMENT ON THE BIGGER PICTURE DDR- FUND INDIGENOUS YOU- ON THE- MY COLLEAGUE IS A LARGE ALSO MENTIONS- JUST SOME CONSIDERATION THAT YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT STRUCTURING YOUR OVERALL. I GENERAL FUND AND G. G. R. F. BUDGET- YEAH WE- MENTIONED THE CLASS MISTAKE STYLE REQUIREMENTS AND THAT THE STATE DOES HAVE SOME. POTENTIALLY WORKS DOING KIND OF MEETING SOME OF THOSE DAHLE REQUIREMENTS AND THERE'S THE POTENTIAL TO FOR ONE OPTION FOR ADDRESSING THOSE IS SOME POTENTIAL SHOPS AND KIND OF WHICH FUNDING SOURCES BETWEEN GENERAL EUROPE FOR USED TO FIND SPECIFIC ACTIVITIES AND OF COURSE WE'RE HAPPY TO- TO HELP PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROFITABLE. FOR YOU AND YOUR STAFF ARE ON THE FINAL ISSUE AROUND THE JUST WHAT'S ACTUALLY BEING PROPOSED AS PART OF THIS YEAR'S MAYOR VISION GIGI R. F. PACKAGE THE- BIG INCREASE AS YOU REFERENCED- WAS A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR METHANE MONITORING SATELLITES- AND YES THOSE ARE REALLY TARGETED AT AT MONITORING I THINK. THE ADMINISTRATION'S INDICATED MAYBE IF YOU KNOW THE IT WITH ADDITIONAL MONITORING THERE COULD BE OPPORTUNITIES TO- IDENTIFY WHERE THAT WHERE NOTHING IS- IS BEING ADMITTED AND PERHAPS TAKE ACTIONS- WE DO THINK. THIS IS AN IMPORTANT YOU YOU SORT OF HAD ON I THINK ONE OF THE CONNECT HE CONSIDERATIONS HERE IS REALLY IS THIS A HIGH PRIORITY. FOR WHERE TO SPEND- LIMITING THAT THE STATE LIMITED RESOURCES THERE SO IT'S A HUNDRED DOLLAR PROPOSED. FOR MONITOR AND THEIR- BUT I'M SURE YOU'RE AWARE ANY OTHER WAY IN WHICH STATE CAN. ABOUT MONEY ANDREAS CLIMATE REALLY ACTED. AND THROUGH YEAH- WELL THAT AMOUNT MONEY IS KIND OF REALLY THE BEST USE OF A BREEZE. I WANT TO SORT OF FLAG. ONE OTHER QUESTION AGAIN WORK THESE ARE ALL PROPOSALS THAT WERE KIND OF CONTINUING TO LOOK INTO JUST ONE OTHER ISSUE ON THE METHANE MONITORING PROPOSAL- WE'RE STILL TRYING TO GET SOME OF THE DETAILS ON EXACTLY HOW THAT. MONEY WOULD BE SPENT SAID OUR UNDERSTANDING IS THAT SOME OF THAT WOULD BE SPENT TO- HELP KIND OF WATCH SOME OF THE- SATELLITE- BUT THERE ALSO MIGHT BE SOME KIND OF ONGOING. COSTS FOR DATA COLLECTION THAT THOSE COSTS- DON'T APPEAR TO BE THERE ARE ANY KIND OF ONGOING SPENDING PROPOSALS AS PART OF THIS THAT'S ANOTHER. I FISCAL CONSIDERATION IF YOU THINK ABOUT. YOU KNOW WHAT'S BEING PROPOSED HERE AND WHETHER OR NOT IT MIGHT CREATE SORT OF MORE ONGOING COST SO THAT'S SOMETHING WILL CONTINUE TO ADD TO EXPLORE LOOK INTO AND PROVIDE COMMENTS TO YOU AND WHAT IS THE GO. YEAH I GUESS I MEAN WE KNOW SOURCE OF METHANE OUR GARY FARMS OR LIFE. WE'VE GOT INFORMATION NOW THAT IN HAWAII THEY HAVE SOME SEAWEED PRODUCTION THAT WE CAN FEED TO THAT THE- ANIMALS AND REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF BELCHING AND BLAH BLAH BLAH WE'VE GOT. AMPLE WE'VE GOT. THAT GESTURES WE KNOW IF WE PUT IN SEVENTEEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR JURY DIGESTED TO SUBSIDIZE IT WE GET ONE. POINT TWO MILLION METRIC TONS OF CARBON REDUCTION OF THE DERRY'S NOT HIDING I MEAN I GUESS THERE COULD BE SOME CALLOUS SOMEWHERE WE KNOW WHERE THEY ARE OUR LANDFILLS ARE. YOU KNOW WE MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO GET ON THE BACKSIDE OF LANDFILL WE KNOW ON THE FRONT SIDE WHAT HOW MUCH METHANE SUBMITTING WE KNOW FROM OUR- SEWAGE TREATMENT PLANTS WERE THE METHODS IT'S- LIKE THERE'S- SOME SURPRISES THERE SOME. UNKNOWN SOURCE OF METHANE OUT THERE I MEAN. THAT I'M GOING TO WE'LL GET IT FOR A HUNDRED MILLION WE'RE GONNA KNOW. OF FINANCE OR MISS. HE ELAINE- HI MELISSA THIS ON THE RESEARCH CHIEF CAR- AND I WANT TO GO TO ABOUT OF THESE OFFICER THAT THEY LEAVE TO RUN TO MAKE SO WE WORK WITH BROAD RULE AND THAT ARE IN PLACE SO YOU'LL BE ABLE TO TEN EXACTLY- WHERE ANIMATION IS COMING FROM FOR EXAMPLE A LEAK FROM THE TANK- AND YOU'LL BE ABLE TO DO THAT WITH THESE ADDITIONAL EIGHT SATELLITES MUCH MORE QUICKLY SO IT ALLOWS US TO LOOK AT OVER 80% OF NOTHING AT THE MEETING INFRASTRUCTURE EVERY TWO WEEKS. AND THEN WITH THAT WE CAN WORK WITH OUR REGULATORY PROGRAMS MORE EFFECTIVELY IMPLEMENT AND ENFORCE THOSE REGULATIONS- AND GET REDUCTIONS NOW AND THAT'S IMPORTANT FOR METHANE ESPECIALLY BECAUSE A SHORT LIVED CLIMATE POLLUTANT AND ANY REDUCTION WE HAVE NOW WILL HAVE A SOONER FAT- TO UP WITH NUMBER SEVEN THERE HOW DOES THAT WORK THROUGH A I GOT A THE PAETUS CALIFORNIA I'VE A LANDFILL IT'S EMITTING METHANE RIGHT NOW THE SATELLITE GOES UP IT'S SO WRONG IT'S NOT TEN IT'S TWENTY FIVE HOW DO YOU CHANGE THAT HOW DO YOU GO OUT TO THE LANDFILL AND IMMEDIATELY YOU KNOW WITH THE WITH THE LOCAL AIRPORT HAVE YES STOP THAT. SO THERE'S VERY DIFFERENTLY THAT THE ON WHAT YOU'RE SOURCE IS- IT'S FOR THE OF WELL I DON'T. THEN IF YOU SEE THAT A INSPECTOR SOMEBODY EVELYN CAN GO OUT FIND WHERE IT IS AND SOMETIMES IT'S AS SIMPLE AS CLOSING OF DAHLE- THERE'S BEEN INSTANCES WHERE A TANK HATCHES OPEN AND IT'S CLOSING OUT OF TEN CATS. YOU MAY NOT FIND NOT FOR A WHILE BUT IF YOU HAVE THESE OVERFLIGHTS HAPPENING WITH THE SATELLITES HAPPENING YOU'LL FIND OUT RIGHT AWAY- SO THOSE ARE SOME OF THE THINGS THAT YOU CAN FIX QUICKLY. THAT ARE SORT OF POINTS OR SOMETHING. BUT I GET MY UNDER. AND I'M NOT I'M NOT PROMOTING TERRY DIGEST BUT- AT THAT. IF WE TOOK A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS AND AGAIN THIS IS A QUESTION DO WE DO THAT IN CAP AND TRADE OR DO WE DO IT IN GENERAL FUND BECAUSE OF THIS. S. A. L. YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT IS BUT IF WE INVESTED A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. IN SIX THIRTY DIE CHESTER'S. WE KNOW THAT WE'RE GOING TO GET SEVEN MILLION METRIC TONS OF CARP OF METHANE REMOVED FROM THE ATMOSPHERE. YOU KNOW THAT NOW IT'S- WE KNOW THAT THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S THERE AND IT'LL TAKE A TWELVE MONTHS OR EIGHTEEN MONTHS THE TO DO THIS. WHY WOULD YOU NOT COUPLE THE PROPOSAL OF MONITORING AND GET AND YOU GET MORE MONEY THIS AB SIX ONE SEVEN SO WE GET MORE DEVICES OUT THERE SERENO'S AND THEN JUST DO IT. I MEAN PRETEND WHAT WILL WORK FOR NIKE STATE OF CALIFORNIA LET'S JUST DO IT FINANCE WHY WOULD YOU NOT DO THAT CARP. WHAT AT WHAT IS SET NOT IN HERE. SO IF YOU DON'T MIND MISTER JERICHO'S CHRISTIAN CULTURE WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I'LL JUST KIND OF- TALKED THE POINT ABOUT WHY SPECIFICALLY THE ADMINISTRATION. WAS- ARE PROPOSING TO UTILIZE YOUR FUNDS AS OPPOSED TO GENERAL FUND- SO SPECIFIC THE UTILIZATION GDR F. AND REASON WHY WE ARE PROPOSED TO UTILIZE THOSE FUNDS SPECIFICALLY IS- MAINLY A LINE. THROUGH THE THAT THE PURPOSE OF EUROPE AND REDUCING OUR GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS YOU KNOW METHANE IS THAT CONSIDERED ONE OF THE MOST OUT THERE. AND GIVEN THAT THIS PARTICULAR PROPOSAL WOULD DIRECTLY- ACTUALLY REDUCE OR HELP- IT SPECIFICALLY- I TRY TO ADDRESS THE WEEKS THAT HARBORS LIVING TO. THE ADMINISTRATION FELT THAT THE- POTENTIAL- INVESTMENTS FROM TO EUROPE HIDING GOOD AND NEXUS. THAT'S THE MAIN REASON WHY WE PRIORITIZE UTILIZING THE DRAFT VERSUS. GENERAL FUND. NO I MEAN I MEAN IT'S CERTAINLY THE FIRST. IN WE WON'T KNOW IT'S- WILL THAT DE. AGAIN WOULD YOU A LOT OF INVESTMENT. AB SIX ONE SEVEN HAS A LOT OF INVESTMENT ON COLLECTED DATA GETTING PEOPLE INVOLVED IN WORD LEAKS IS BUT WE'RE NOT. WE'RE NOT GETTING TO THE ULTIMATE PROBLEM OF HOW DO YOU REDUCE THOSE. HAD A HAVE YOU REDUCE THOSE EMISSIONS OR WARD BUDGET ALL RIGHT RIGHT I'M- I'LL GO BACK TO CENTER CRAWFORD MY LAST QUESTION- YOU KNOW WORDS I GUESS THIS OFFICIALLY STARTS NEGOTIATIONS WE HAVE. THE YOU'VE OUTDOOR ACCESS AND- THIRTY BY THIRTY PROPOSAL WITH THE DETAILS IN THE MAY REVISE OF THE SEVEN HUNDRED SIXTY EIGHT- THAT WHICH WAS AGREED TO LAST YEAR THE SENATE PROPOSAL HAS- CHALLENGE THE ADMINISTRATION WITH THE BILLION DOLLARS MORE SPENT OVER A FEW YEARS- IN WE BELIEVE THAT SOME OF THE SOME OF THE THINGS IT YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT. INCREASING EQUITY ACCESS GRANT PROGRAMS HAPPENING- OUTDOOR ACCESS FOR THE WILDLIFE CONSERVATION URBAN GREENING AND- URBAN FOREST AND ME THIS GOAL OF BY THIRTY THIS AT THIS ADDITIONAL. BILLION DOLLARS FOR BIODIVERSITY HELPS YOU ACHIEVE YOUR GOAL DID TO DISTURB WITH THAT. WELL LET ME FIRST. HUGE THANKS TO THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR LAST YEAR FOR AGREEING TO THREE QUARTERS OF A BILLION DOLLARS FOR NATURE BASED SOLUTIONS. AND FOR THOSE WHO ARE WATCHING MAY BE SCRATCHING THEIR HEADS WHEN WE SAY THAT TERM NATURE BASED SOLUTIONS THIS IS ALL ABOUT HELPING NATURE HELP US IN OTHER WORDS IMPROVING OUR ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION- BOTH TO REMOVE CARBON AND STORE CARBON FROM THE ATMOSPHERE OFFER CLIMATE IMPACTS PROTECT THIS REMARKABLE BIODIVERSITY WE HAVE IN TO PROVIDE MORE EQUITABLE ACCESS TO THE OUTDOORS FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS. AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE SO EXCITED TO BE ADVANCING THIRTY BY THIRTY WHICH IS REALLY I HAVE AN IDEA SEATED IN THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSERVE 30% OF OUR LANDS AND COASTAL WATERS BY TWENTY THIRTY. NOW THIS THREE QUARTERS OF A BILLION DOLLARS IS CERTAINLY JUST A DOWN PAYMENT TO WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO ACHIEVE THIRTY BY THIRTY AND ARE IMPROVE MANAGEMENT OF OUR LANDS FOR THIS CLIMATE ACTION SO I WOULD SAY IN ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION SENATOR WHITE HOUSE THE WHITE HOUSE SKI- RESOURCES INTO ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION INTO THIRTY BY THIRTY IN COMING YEARS. HOWEVER MUCH THEY ARE WILL INDEED. BENEFIT THESE GOALS. WE HOPE DID MISS ADMINISTRATION WILL SHARPEN THEIR PENCILS AND LOOK AT THE SENATE PROPOSAL ON THE BIODIVERSITY BECAUSE WE- WE BELIEVE WE'VE WE'VE BUILT ON THAT SPIRIT THAT YOU TALKED ABOUT WAX. LAST YEAR ALL RIGHT I'VE- I'M GONNA STOP ASKING QUESTIONS THANK YOU FOR THE PRESENTATION OF THE GOVERNOR'S MAY REVISE AT THIS TIME I WILL OPEN. THE THE HEARING UP FOR PUBLIC COMMENT EVERYBODY AT THE MINISTRATION ALLEY- ONCE AGAIN THANK YOU VERY MUCH- SO THOSE MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WHO WOULD LIKE TO COMMENT ON THE GOVERNOR'S MANY REVISIONS ON RESOURCES PLEASE COME FORWARD. WHERE'S YOURS. THANK YOU GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN BURST. ARTEMI RECALL MASTRODONATO THE TRUST FOR PUBLIC LAND I'M HERE TO STRONGLY URGE YOU TO CONSIDER RESTORING FUNDING TO THE STATE WIDE LOCAL PARKS AND COMMUNITY REVITALIZATION PROGRAM THAT WAS ESTABLISHED IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT BY AB THIRTY ONE IS CURRENTLY OUT OF MONEY. YOU JUST COMMENTED SENATOR WACHOWSKI ABOUT EQUITY IN ACCESS THE FIRST PLACE WE NEED TO START TO GET TO ACHIEVE THAT IS WHERE PEOPLE LIVE TO MAKE IT WITHIN WALKING DISTANCE AND PARKS ARE NOT AN AMENITY PARKS ARE A CORE COMPONENT TO A HEALTHY COMMUNITY. AND THEY PROBABLY HAVE AS MANY QUALITY CO BENEFITS AS ANY GRANTING PROGRAM IN THE STATE A LOCAL PARKS ADDRESS NOT ONLY EQUITABLE ACCESS BUT EXTREME HEAT THEY MITIGATE FLOODING THE IMPROVE AIR AND WATER QUALITY- THEY OBVIOUSLY PERCENT RECREATIONAL BENEFITS TO THE COMMUNITY. SO THERE'S A LOT OF BANG FOR THE BUCK HERE AND I SHARE SENATOR MCGUIRE'S FRUSTRATION ABOUT THIS NOT BEING FUNDED AND I CAN'T FIGURE OUT WHY AND TO THE NOTION THAT CALIFORNIA MAY BE HALFWAY THERE ARE GETTING CLOSE TO BEING. PARK- YOU KNOW HAVING ENOUGH PARKS ARE- UP TO THE TRUST FOR PUBLIC LAND'S ANNUAL PARK SCORE CAME OUT A LITTLE WHILE AGO SEVEN CALIFORNIA CITIES ARE IN THE BOTTOM 25% OF THE LARGEST CITIES IN THE US WHEN IT COMES TO PARK ACCESS- AND- A LIST OF. UP SEVEN DIFFERENT SENATORS AND SEVEN DIFFERENT DISTRICTS THE A REPRESENT THOSE CITIES. AND WHEN WE TALK ABOUT VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES. IF YOU'RE PARK POOR YOU ARE VULNERABLE BECAUSE THERE IS A 1100% CORRELATION BETWEEN LOW INCOME. AND PARK POOR AND LOW INCOME MEANS HIGHER OBESITY RATES MORE UNDERLYING CONDITIONS AND MORE- THREAT TO THE COMMUNITY. SO I URGE YOU TO CONSIDER RESTORING THIS ARE GONNA. WE'RE HAVING A RALLY AT THREE O'CLOCK OUTSIDE THE CAPITAL SO PLEASE JOIN US NEXT. MISTER CHAIRMAN CENTER STERN AT MANNING ON BEHALF OF CATALINA CHANNEL EXPRESS- WE KELLY CHANNEL EXPRESSES THE COMPANY THAT OPERATES THE FERRY SERVICE- EVERYDAY HOURS DAY THREE AND SIXTY FIVE DAYS A YEAR TO CATALINA ISLAND SO IT'S LIFE FLIGHT SO YOU WHY AM I HERE- CARB ADOPTED A RULE THIS YEAR ON HARBOR CRAFT AND BASICALLY REQUIRED- OVERHAULING OF THE FLEET FOR A VARIETY OF HARBOR CRAFT VESSELS INCLUDING FERRIES- WE WORK CONSTRUCTIVELY WITH CARBONTHAT BUT THE REALITY IS THAT- IN ORDER TO GET THE EMISSIONS REDUCTION IN THE GREENHOUSE GAS BENEFITS. WE WERE GOING TO HAVE TO REPLACE ALL OF OUR FERRIES THEY COST TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS A VESSEL TO REPLACE WE HAVE- TO THE PURITY YEARS TO DO IT BUT SOME OF THE BEST REPLACEMENTS HAVE TO START IMMEDIATELY. SO OUR. SIX NEW VESSELS OVERTIME. THE THE PROBLEM WE HAVE IS THAT THE EXISTING FUNDING PROGRAMS FOR A MORE FOR EXAMPLE. IT'S ONLY A HUNDRED THIRTY MILLION A YEAR AND ITS OVER SUBSCRIBED IN SOUTH BECAUSE THERE'S NO MONEY AVAILABLE IN THIS FUNDING CYCLE TWO THINGS ONE IS- WE HAVE A MEMBER REQUESTS IN THE ASSEMBLY SIDE BUT WE'RE TRYING TO SEE IF WE CAN FIND A PART OF FUNDING. THAT COULD BE AVAILABLE FOR FERRIES WE'RE NOT ASKING FOR A BECAUSE FOR EXAMPLE. THERE ARE FAIRIES WHO ARE OPERATED BY PUBLIC ENTITIES- WHO HAVE THE ABILITY TO FUND SOMETHING LIKE THIS. CATALINA CHANNEL EXPRESS IS A PRIVATE COMPANY. THEY CAN'T GET FINANCING FOR TWENTY MILLION YOU CAN UP THE FAIREST POSSIBLY HIGH ENOUGH THE RECOVERY. AND SO WITHOUT STATE FUNDING IT'S NOT FINANCE RIPPLE ON AND SO- WE WERE LOOKING FOR A GRANT PROGRAM- ONE IDEA- AND I THINK FINANCES LOOKING AT THIS IS. THERE TO SIX HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR- SPENDING- PROPOSAL IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET FOR OFF ROAD VEHICLES TRUCKS AND OTHERS- AND- THAT WOULD BE ONE PLACE THAT WE COULD TRY TO INCLUDE- YOU SEE REGULATED COMMON CARRIER FERRIES FOR- FUNDING. AND THE OTHER WOULD BE JUST TO HAVE A COMPETITIVE POT FOR- THE PC REGULATED FERRIES THAT ARE PRIVATE ENTITIES. SO THEY CAN COMPETE FOR THE FUNDING. SO APPRECIATE NOW YOU HAVE A LOT ON YOUR PLATE AND A GAZILLION DOLLARS OF ASSETS BUT- THIS ONE MAKES A DIFFERENCE BECAUSE IT'S THE ONLY WAY TO GET TO AND FROM CATALINA ISLAND THANKS. THANK YOU NECKS. HELLO GOOD MORNING CHAU CASKEY AND MEMBERS STEVEN MYERS ON BEHALF OF THE LOCAL CONSERVATION COURSE HERE IN CALIFORNIA- THE CORES ARE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THE FIFTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS IN THE MAY REVISED. TO THE CALIFORNIA CONSERVATION CORPS FOR EXPANDING EDUCATION AND ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES AT LOCAL AND TRIBAL CORES FOR CLIMATE LEADERSHIP. OF THIS FUNDING WILL EMPOWER YOUNG ADULTS FROM SOME OF THE MOST DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES IN THE STATE TO ENGAGE IN PROJECTS THAT WILL CREATE MORE CLIMATE RESILIENT COMMUNITIES AND TRAIN THEM. TO BE THE STATE'S NEXT GENERATION OF- CLIMATE LEADERS. WE'RE ALSO ENCOURAGED BY THE ADDITIONAL FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN THE MAY REVISED TO THE TO EXPAND FUNDING FOR THE ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM. IN LIGHT OF THIS ADDITIONAL FUNDING WE WOULD ASK THE SENATE TO CONSIDER SENATOR GONZALEZ'S REQUEST TO ALLOCATE. TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS OF WHAT IS NOW ONE BILLION DOLLAR PART OF FUNDING TO THE CCC AND THE LOCAL COURSE TO ALLOW OUR CORPS MEMBERS TO CONTINUE ENGAGING IN PROJECTS. TO MAKE OUR COMMUNITIES MORE WALKABLE AND BIKEABLE AND WILL IMPROVE AIR QUALITY AND M. AND- REDUCE VEHICLE EMISSIONS BY REDUCING VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED THANK YOU SO MUCH. NEXT MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS THE COMMITTEE LOUIS BROWN HERE TODAY ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA COTTON GROWERS IN JENNER'S ASSOCIATION A WESTERN AGRICULTURAL PROCESSORS SERVICES ASSOCIATION. OPPOSED TO THE EIGHTY PERMANENT STAFF POSITIONS AT THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD THAT ARE UNFUNDED- THOSE EIGHTY POSITIONS ARE PERMANENT. AND THOSE EIGHTY POSITIONS WILL COME BACK TO US AND OUR MEMBERS AS FEE PAYERS THE WATER BOARD. TO COMPENSATE FOR THOSE IN YEARS TO COME WE'VE HAD ON GOING ON CONVERSATIONS WITH THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD ABOUT. THE INCREASES IN FEES THAT WE SEE ON A REGULAR BASIS AND I'VE GOT NO WHERE ON THAT. THESE FEES COME BACK TO OUR MEMBERS WE HAVE FAMILY OWNED NOT PROCESSING FACILITIES COTTON GINS THROUGHOUT THE STATE THAT PAY MORE ON AN ANNUAL BASIS. IN FEES TO THE STATE WATER BOARD INTO ALL OTHER STATE AGENCIES COMBINED. SO WE GET REALLY CONCERNED WE SEE ONE TIME FUNDING ALLOCATIONS. COMBINED WITH PERMANENT STAFF BECAUSE WE KNOW THOSE PERMANENT STAFF GOING TO COME BACK AND WE WILL BE EXPECTED TO PAY FOR THEM. VIA FEES THANK YOU. THANK YOU MAX. JR MEMBERS THANK YOU I'M TOM KNOX VALLEY CLEAN AIR NOW WE MANAGED TO CLEAN CARS FOR ALL PROGRAM IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY ON BEHALF OF THE VALLEY ARE DISTRICT. WE APPRECIATE THE PRIORITY THE ADMINISTRATION LEGISLATURE AND PUT ON CLEAN CARS FOR ALL IN THIS BUDGET. HOWEVER WE HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THE PROPOSED FUNDING SPLIT BETWEEN HE FIVE DISTRICTS THAT CURRENTLY OFFER CLEAN CARS FOR ALL. AND A PROPOSED NEW STATEWIDE PROGRAM. IF THE PRIORITY HERE IS TO EXPEDITE MORE FUNDING FOR ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE PURCHASES IN THE COMMUNITIES THAT MOST NEED TO HELP. THE EXISTING PROGRAMS THE FIVE YEAR DISTRICTS SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO THIS. THESE ARE APPROVAL PROGRAMS THAT ARE OVERSUBSCRIBED MOST OF THE TIME AND HAVE A LOT MORE CAPACITY TO SERVE MANY MORE CUSTOMERS. FOR EXAMPLE OUR OUR CURRENT CUSTOMER APPLICATION RATE. WITH SUPPORT ANNUAL I SPENT A FIFTY TO SIXTY MILLION IN SILICON VALLEY ALONE. IF THE CURRENT FUNDING PROPOSAL MAY REVISE IS ENACTED THE TEN MILLION ALLOCATED TO SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY WOULD NOT BE ASSIST. NOT BE SUFFICIENT TO FUND EVEN THE CUSTOMERS WHO CURRENTLY HAVE APPLICATIONS PENDING. ONCE WE SERVE THOSE PENDING CUSTOMERS WOULD BE FORCED TO SHUT DOWN OUR PROGRAM. I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST THIS COMMITTEE CONSIDER FLIPPING THE PROPOSED AMOUNTS FOR THE EXISTING TO SERVE PROGRAMS AND THE PROPOSED STATEWIDE PROGRAM. IT IF TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION IS ALLOCATED EXISTING PROGRAMS ALLOW FOR CONTINUED PROGRESS THROUGHOUT THE STATE IN THE DISTRICTS REPRESENT AN ESTIMATED CONTAIN MORE THAN 90% OF THE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES- TO CLOSE BY BY THANKING SENATOR STERN- HE RECOGNIZED VERY EARLY ON THAT THIS- PROGRAM NEEDS TO BE RUN AS A REGIONAL PROGRAM.

ON TODAY WE HAVE A CLIMATE CRISIS AND WE BELIEVE THIS OPTION IS NECESSARY TO GET NEW PROJECTS ONLINE TO SUPPORT OUR RELIABILITY NEEDS. THE CDC CITING PROCESS IS VERY THOROUGH AND RIGOROUS IT ALSO TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION LOCAL CONCERNS SO WE ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT ON THAT THANK YOU THANK YOU NECKS. MISTER CHAIR SENATOR STERN BETHEL ALSO ON BEHALF OF VARIOUS CLIENTS- STARTING WITH WATER REUSE CALIFORNIA THANK YOU SENATOR STERN FOR HIGHLIGHTING THE TENS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF NEED FOR WATER RECYCLING- CAN'T THROW ENOUGH MONEY AT IT CREATES NEW WATER SO.

SO RESPECTFULLY REQUEST THE SUB COMMITTEE AT THIS TO THE BUDGET AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME THANK YOU NEXT. MISTER CHAIR SENATOR STERN DILUTION HERE- ON BEHALF OF THE FORTY ACRE CONSERVATION LEAGUE. ONE OF THE STATE'S ONLY BLACK LED LAND CONSERVANCY'S ONE EXPRESS. AWESOME SUPPORT FOR THE ADMINISTRATION AND THEIR ALLOCATIONS- TO SPECIFICALLY TO THE WILDLIFE CONSERVATION BOARD. ALTHOUGH I WILL SAY OVERALL MR CHEER THAT WE REALLY STRONGLY SUPPORT THE SENATE'S FRAMEWORK THAT YOU ALL LAID OUT- IN TERMS OF THOSE INCREASED INVESTMENTS I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT TWO ADDITIONAL POINTS. CONCERNING THE WILDLIFE CONSERVATION BOARD WERE A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED THAT THEIR PROPOSAL- DOES NOT INCLUDE MORE IN THE WAY OF FUNDING. THE PUBLIC ACCESS PROGRAMS WHICH WE SEE IS. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT I THINK WE WOULD ASK YOU MISTER CHAIR TO CONSIDER- IF NECESSARY STATUTORY LANGUAGE THAT WOULD ENABLE THE WILDLIFE CONSERVATION BOARD. TO UTILIZE OTHER FUNDING POTS THAT ARE GENERAL FUND FUNDED FOR PUBLIC ACCESS SO THERE IT'S A LITTLE INTERCHANGEABLE IN THAT SENSE. AND THEN THE SECOND THING THAT I THINK WE WOULD ASK YOU AND WE WANT TO START TO HAVE THESE CONVERSATIONS. ARM WE APPRECIATE WE SUPPORT WE RESPECT THE ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS SET ASIDE. FOR TRIBES IN THE WAY OF THAT THAT'S GOING TO BE ROLLED OUT- BUT WE WOULD ASK THAT YOU ALL LOOK AT IT NOT A STRICTLY AS A SITE FOR TRIBES BUT- A BY PARKS SAID ASIDE BROADLY OR AT LEAST CARVING SOME MONEY OUT WHERE. THERE'S A CERTAIN AMOUNT GUARANTEED TO TRIBES BUT THERE'S ALSO A CERTAIN AMOUNT IN THE- RESERVE FOR BLACK INDIGENOUS PEOPLE OF COLOR SETRA. ARM WE HAVE I HAVE BEEN PRETTY SUCCESSFUL IN. WORKING WITH VARIOUS PARTS OF THE ADMINISTRATION OTHER PROGRAMS PRIMARILY RELATED TO HOUSING IN ARTFULLY CRAFTING- BY POT SET ASIDE LANGUAGE WITHOUT VIOLATING ANY- LET'S JUST SAY U. S. OR CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTIONAL ALL RESTRICTIONS AND SO WOULD LOVE TO TALK TO YOU A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THAT THANK YOU SIR. THANK YOU NEXT. THANK YOU CHAIR SOONER STERN KEITH ON BEHALF OF SITES RESERVOIR WANTED TO- WHAT THE GOVERNOR THE MINISTRATION AND THANK THEM FOR THE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR GENERAL FUND COMMITMENTS TO THE WATER STORAGE PROGRAMS- LIKE THE PREVIOUS SPEAKER WERE CURIOUS ABOUT THE TWENTY FIVE TWENTY SIX APPROPRIATION. I WOULD SUGGEST THAT WE'RE IN A DROUGHT NOW AND I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO ROBUST DISCUSSION ABOUT MOVING THAT APPROPRIATION TO THIS YEAR THIS IS THE STATE'S INVESTMENT IN THE PUBLIC- BENEFIT OF ALL THESE PROGRAMS IS FOR ALL THE PROP ONE STORAGE PROGRAMS ON HERE FOR SITES WITH THIS BENEFITS ALL THE PROP ONE ALL SEVEN PROJECTS. AGAIN WE'RE VERY APPRECIATIVE OF THE HARD WORK OF THE SECRETARY AND ALL THE AGENCIES AND MOVING ALL THESE PROJECTS FORWARD WE SEE THEIR DEDICATION AND WHAT I WOULD SUGGEST IS THAT IN THIS TIME OF GREAT INFLATION AND X. EXCESS COSTS THE LONGER THAT WE WAIT THE MORE THAT MONEY IS GOING TO BE. WORTH LESS SO I WOULD GREATLY ENCOURAGE US TO SUPPORT THE GOVERNOR I HOPE THE LEGISLATURE WOULD CONSIDER MOVING IT FROM A TWENTY FIVE TWENTY SIX TWO PERHAPS THIS YEAR THIS YEAR'S BUDGET I THINK THAT WE HAVE THE RESOURCES FROM EVERYTHING THAT I'VE SEEN- IN PRINT IT'S AN INVESTMENT IN THE PUBLIC. ITS INVESTMENT IN WATER IN THE LONGER THAT WE WAIT THE LESS THAT FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS GOING TO BE WORTH THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU NEXT. THANK YOU CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS- SO MY NAME IS ANNA LENA I'M WITH THE TRUST OF PUBLIC LAND- WITH THE LOS ANGELES RAMS TO BE EXACT GOOD MORNING AND THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS YOU- AND- PROVIDE SOME PUBLIC COMMENT ON THE IMPORTANCE OF GREEN SCHOOLYARDS. AND MAKING THE CASE FOR AN INCREASE FOR FROM FIFTY MILLION TO TWO HUNDRED MILLION. AS PROPOSED CURRENTLY. THE PATENT DEMOCRATS YOU KNOW EXACERBATING ISSUES SUFFERED BY THE MOST VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES ACROSS CALIFORNIA. OPEN SPACE AND PARK ACCESS IS ONE OF THEM. ACROSS CALIFORNIA WE WILL FIND MANY COMMUNITIES WITH NO PARKS WITHIN A TEN MINUTE WALK. BUT THOSE SAME COMMUNITIES OFTEN HAVE A SCHOOL. AND THOSE SAME SCHOOLS HAVE LITTLE TO NO OPEN SPACE. WITHIN THEM. GREEN SCHOOLYARDS ARE BY BRANDS GREEN SPACES WITH NATURAL PLAY STRUCTURES AND OUTDOOR CLASSROOMS LEAST CAN PROMOTE PARK EQUITY CLIMATE RESILIENCE AND LEADUS TOWARDS A MORE POSITIVE EDUCATION. AND HEALTH OUTCOMES WHICH EVERYBODY WANTS. DESPITE THE BEST BENEFITS GREEN SCHOOLYARDS CAN PROVIDE THERE IS CURRENTLY NO FUNDING TO TURN ALL ASPHALT HEAVY. SCHOOLYARDS INTO GREEN SCHOOLYARDS. IN LOS ANGELES WE ARE WORKING ON OUR FIRST GREEN SCHOOLYARD IN THE HIGHLY VULNERABLE COMMUNITY BECAUSE UNION. WE ARE DRYING FROM DECADES OF EXPERTISE IN CREATING GREEN SPACES. ARE WHEN IT COMES TO PARKS IT BETTER FOCUS ON COMMUNITY LED DESIGN AND PARTICIPATORY DESIGN. AND MANY OF THE LESSONS THAT WE HAVE LEARNED FROM OUR NEW YORK PROGRAM WHO TO DATE HAS HAVE TRANSFORM TWO HUNDRED. GREEN SCHOOLYARDS INTO WHAT WE CALL GREEN SCHOOLYARDS VERY SUCCESSFULLY. I AM A PRODUCT OF LAUSD AND THAT'S A PLAY ON THESE HOT HOT ASPHALT. PLACE ARCHERS AND YARDS THAT'S FOR OVER THREE DECADES LATER I CAN TELL YOU THAT THAT SEEMS SCHOOL THAT I WENT TO HAVE STRUCTURALLY BEEN UPGRADED. BUT THE SCREEN SCHOOL YOU ARE OR I MEAN THE LACK OF A GREEN SCHOOLYARD IS CURRENTLY A REALITY THERE. SO WITH THAT IN MIND. GREEN SCHOOLYARDS I WANTED TO JUST EMPHASIZE THE GREEN SQUARES CAN HELP US CONTACT PARK INEQUITIES WHICH ARE SUFFERED BY OUR MOST VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES AND REALLY HELP US OFFSET SOME OF THIS EXTREME HEAT ISLAND EFFECTS- THAT MANY OF THESE COMMUNITIES ALSO SUFFER. THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU NEXT.
