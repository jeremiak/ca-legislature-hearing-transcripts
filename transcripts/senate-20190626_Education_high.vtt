00:26:38.363 --> 00:26:38.964
FOR THAT.

00:26:39.030 --> 00:26:44.803
BUT WE SHOULDN'T BE TRYING.

00:26:44.869 --> 00:26:47.105
TO LEGISLATURE -- THE CURRICULA.

00:26:47.172 --> 00:26:50.442
AND A SO I THINK -- IN MANY WAYS

00:26:50.508 --> 00:26:52.677
THAT'S MY CONCERN IS THAT I

00:26:52.744 --> 00:26:53.278
WOULD LOVE IT IF EVERY SCHOOL

00:26:53.345 --> 00:26:53.945
DISTRICT.

00:26:54.012 --> 00:26:55.914
NO DOUBT THAT THEY YOU BILLS

00:26:55.981 --> 00:26:56.982
ACCOMPLISHED BUT A MUCH DIME

00:26:57.048 --> 00:26:58.583
BAND AS SOME CONCERNS ABOUT.

00:26:58.650 --> 00:26:59.718
THIS IS THE ROUTE WHICH WERE

00:26:59.784 --> 00:27:03.021
TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH IT -- AND

00:27:03.088 --> 00:27:05.256
SO CAN YOU SPEAK.

00:27:05.323 --> 00:27:07.025
TO EFFORTS -- I MEAN IS THAT I

00:27:07.092 --> 00:27:07.692
UNDERSTAND FUND NOW THIS IS

00:27:07.759 --> 00:27:08.426
ACTUALLY SPONSORED BY THE

00:27:08.493 --> 00:27:10.395
SUPERINTENDENT OF THE WHOSE

00:27:10.462 --> 00:27:11.863
OVERSEAS IN THE VERY DEPARTMENT

00:27:11.930 --> 00:27:13.698
I MEAN WHY CAN'T THE

00:27:13.765 --> 00:27:15.066
SUPERINTENDENT IN THE WAY OF THE

00:27:15.133 --> 00:27:16.101
AND EVERYONE SAID.

00:27:16.167 --> 00:27:17.202
WE SHOULDN'T.

00:27:17.268 --> 00:27:18.903
WE SHOULD DO THIS THROUGH THE

00:27:18.970 --> 00:27:21.206
USUAL WAY THAT WE'RE SUPPOSED TO

00:27:21.272 --> 00:27:22.907
BE DOING THIS INSTEAD OF TRYING

00:27:22.974 --> 00:27:24.242
TO IMPOSE IT.

00:27:24.309 --> 00:27:26.411
FROM THE LEGISLATURE -- BECAUSE

00:27:26.478 --> 00:27:28.413
THERE'S MANY WERE THE THINGS AND

00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:28.980
THEY SAID THAT MAKE STUDIES

00:27:29.047 --> 00:27:32.484
CERTAINLY I THINK YOU MAKE A

00:27:32.550 --> 00:27:33.084
VERY POWERFUL CASE FOR ETHNIC

00:27:33.151 --> 00:27:35.420
STUDIES -- NAVY PEOPLE CAN'T

00:27:35.487 --> 00:27:36.521
BECAUSE POWERFUL CASE FOR OTHER

00:27:36.588 --> 00:27:37.789
THINGS BUT YEAH I THINK I THINK

00:27:37.856 --> 00:27:38.656
WE I I AM CONCERNING YOUR

00:27:38.723 --> 00:27:40.425
TEACHER -- SO I APPRECIATE THAT

00:27:40.492 --> 00:27:41.326
TO YOUR OWN EXPERIENCE THAT YOU

00:27:41.393 --> 00:27:42.894
KNOW -- YOU KNOW YOU HAVE TO

00:27:42.961 --> 00:27:43.928
FIGURE OUT HOW TO MANAGE A

00:27:43.995 --> 00:27:45.230
CURRICULA YOU HAVE A CERTAIN

00:27:45.296 --> 00:27:46.331
FIXED AMOUNT OF TIME WITH

00:27:46.398 --> 00:27:49.401
STUDENTS -- AND YOU HAVE TO

00:27:49.467 --> 00:27:51.069
FIGURE OUT HOW DO I YOU KNOW HOW

00:27:51.136 --> 00:27:52.270
TO EDUCATE.

00:27:52.337 --> 00:27:55.040
AND SO FORTH AND AND CERTAINLY I

00:27:55.106 --> 00:27:56.374
THINK -- ETHNIC SAY IS A VERY

00:27:56.441 --> 00:27:58.710
IMPORTANT PART OF THAT BUT AT

00:27:58.777 --> 00:27:59.711
CERTAIN POINTS OUT LIKE I AS THE

00:27:59.778 --> 00:28:04.149
EDUCATORS NEED TO BE ABLE.

00:28:04.215 --> 00:28:05.350
TO YOU KNOW FIGURE HIGH PUT ALL

00:28:05.417 --> 00:28:07.919
THE PIECES TOGETHER RIGHT SELF.

00:28:07.986 --> 00:28:08.486
THE LEGISLATURE SAYS I WANT

00:28:08.553 --> 00:28:09.287
MANDATE THIS COURSE HERE IN THAT

00:28:09.354 --> 00:28:10.955
CLASS AND HAS TO BE IN A CERTAIN

00:28:11.022 --> 00:28:15.060
WAY -- THAT CAN CONSTRAIN EVERY

00:28:15.126 --> 00:28:16.027
I THINK WE SAID.

00:28:16.094 --> 00:28:17.862
YOU SHOULD TEACH ETHNIC STUDIES

00:28:17.929 --> 00:28:19.631
AND THAT SHOULD BE SOMETHING.

00:28:19.697 --> 00:28:20.865
THAT STUDENTS NEED TO

00:28:20.932 --> 00:28:22.600
DEMONSTRATE COMPETENCE AND AND

00:28:22.667 --> 00:28:24.436
DAY AND AND BEFORE THEY GRADUATE

00:28:24.502 --> 00:28:25.904
THAT'S ONE THING BUT THEN THE

00:28:25.970 --> 00:28:29.007
START BEING VERY SPECIFIC ABOUT

00:28:29.074 --> 00:28:29.607
WHICH I WAS A PERHAPS YOU CAN

00:28:29.674 --> 00:28:31.609
SPEAK [inaudible]

00:28:31.676 --> 00:28:32.310
TO WHY.

00:28:32.377 --> 00:28:33.445
WHY WE'RE NOT GOING THROUGH THE

00:28:33.511 --> 00:28:35.180
DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION WHY

00:28:35.246 --> 00:28:36.815
ISN'T THE SUPERINTEND WELL YOU

00:28:36.881 --> 00:28:37.715
CAN'T SPEAK FOR THE SUPER DEAD

00:28:37.782 --> 00:28:38.550
BODIES SPONSOR BUT I MEAN WHY

00:28:38.616 --> 00:28:41.219
ARE WE GOING THROUGH THAT ROUTE

00:28:41.286 --> 00:28:42.787
INSTEAD OF THIS -- ONE WHERE

00:28:42.854 --> 00:28:43.755
WE'RE BASICALLY TELLING

00:28:43.822 --> 00:28:46.057
DEPARTMENT OCCASION THEY HAVE TO

00:28:46.124 --> 00:28:47.892
DO SOMETHING.

00:28:47.959 --> 00:28:48.760
I MEAN YOU HAVE A LOT OF SUPPORT

00:28:48.827 --> 00:28:50.628
WILL HAVE EDUCATORS HERE -- I

00:28:50.695 --> 00:28:52.530
MEAN IT'S GREAT -- SO WHY THE

00:28:52.597 --> 00:28:53.264
WAY PEOPLE FEEL LIKE THEY CAN'T

00:28:53.331 --> 00:28:55.066
GO THROUGH THE EDUCATION ROUTE

00:28:55.133 --> 00:28:57.102
THROUGH THE EDUCATION DEPARTMENT

00:28:57.168 --> 00:28:58.903
WHERE V. OF EDUCATORS FELL

00:28:58.970 --> 00:29:01.239
EDUCATORS THERE AND WE HAVE SO

00:29:01.306 --> 00:29:02.941
MUCH SUPPORT AND EDUCATION TO ME

00:29:03.007 --> 00:29:03.908
THAT WAS EXPRESSED HERE.

00:29:03.975 --> 00:29:05.210
WHY CAN'T IT BE ACCOMPLISHED

00:29:05.276 --> 00:29:07.879
THAT WAY INSTEAD OF -- BASICALLY

00:29:07.946 --> 00:29:11.683
FROM THE OUTSIDE FRANKLY YEAH.

00:29:11.749 --> 00:29:12.650
THANK YOU SENATOR YES I I THINK

00:29:12.717 --> 00:29:13.718
IT'S AN EXCELLENT EXCELLENT

00:29:13.785 --> 00:29:15.653
QUESTION.

00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:18.022
SO AS YOU MENTIONED I WAS A

00:29:18.089 --> 00:29:21.292
TEACHER HIGH SCHOOL TEACHER.

00:29:21.359 --> 00:29:22.427
AND ONE OF THE SUBJECTS THAT I

00:29:22.494 --> 00:29:25.163
TOP WAS HISTORY -- AND GOT A

00:29:25.230 --> 00:29:30.068
MASTERS IN HISTORY -- SO I FEEL --

00:29:30.135 --> 00:29:31.870
SOMEWHAT COMPETENT IN THE FIELD

00:29:31.936 --> 00:29:33.505
OF HIS I RECOGNIZE IS AN EXPERT

00:29:33.571 --> 00:29:35.240
IN THIS.

00:29:35.306 --> 00:29:37.308
AND I AND I WOULD SAY THAT IT IS

00:29:37.375 --> 00:29:39.210
NOT I AGREE WITH YOU.

00:29:39.277 --> 00:29:41.946
THAT IT IS NOT OR SHOULDN'T BE.

00:29:42.013 --> 00:29:43.248
THE LEGISLATURE'S ROLE

00:29:43.314 --> 00:29:48.086
[inaudible] TO RIGHT CURRICULA.

00:29:48.153 --> 00:29:49.354
TO SAY WHAT CLASSES SHOULD

00:29:49.420 --> 00:29:51.456
INCLUDE.

00:29:51.523 --> 00:29:53.758
WHETHER IT BE HISTORY.

00:29:53.825 --> 00:29:55.593
OR FOREIGN LANGUAGE OR MATH OR

00:29:55.660 --> 00:29:57.462
SCIENCE IT IS NOT THE ROLE OF

00:29:57.529 --> 00:29:59.397
THE LEAD OF THE LEGISLATURE TO

00:29:59.464 --> 00:30:00.632
SAY WHAT SHOULD BE.

00:30:00.698 --> 00:30:02.433
IN THE CURRICULUM.

00:30:02.500 --> 00:30:05.336
AND THIS BILL DOESN'T DO THAT.

00:30:05.403 --> 00:30:08.439
THIS BILL DOESN'T DO THAT AT ALL.

00:30:08.506 --> 00:30:10.208
AS I MENTIONED IN MY EARLIER

00:30:10.275 --> 00:30:12.243
REMARKS.

00:30:12.310 --> 00:30:14.445
WE HAD A ASSEMBLY MEMBER LEVEL

00:30:14.512 --> 00:30:16.347
WHO INTRODUCED THE BILL THAT

00:30:16.414 --> 00:30:17.382
PASSED THE DEPARTMENT OF

00:30:17.448 --> 00:30:19.284
EDUCATION. TO CREATE THE

00:30:19.350 --> 00:30:20.785
CURRICULUM.

00:30:20.852 --> 00:30:22.453
THEY HAVE DONE THAT NOW.

00:30:22.520 --> 00:30:24.756
THAT CURRICULUM THAT THEY

00:30:24.822 --> 00:30:25.557
CREATED.

00:30:25.623 --> 00:30:28.927
WITH INPUT FROM TEACHERS.

00:30:28.993 --> 00:30:31.229
FROM -- ACADEMICS.

00:30:31.296 --> 00:30:33.431
OF FROM PEOPLE IN THE FIELD.

00:30:33.498 --> 00:30:35.200
THEY DEVELOP THE CURRICULUM.

00:30:35.266 --> 00:30:37.702
SO WE THE LEGISLATURE.

00:30:37.769 --> 00:30:39.537
OUR HANDS OFF ON THAT AS WE

00:30:39.604 --> 00:30:40.505
SHOULD BE.

00:30:40.572 --> 00:30:43.408
AS WE SHOULD BE -- IT I THINK

00:30:43.474 --> 00:30:44.809
WOULD BE DANGEROUS FOR

00:30:44.876 --> 00:30:47.045
LEGISLATURE'SLEGISLATORS TO SAY

00:30:47.111 --> 00:30:49.214
WHAT HAS TO BE IN THE CURRICULUM

00:30:49.280 --> 00:30:50.715
SO WE DID THAT.

00:30:50.782 --> 00:30:52.317
WE DID THAT WE DID WITH DID THAT

00:30:52.383 --> 00:30:54.419
WITH THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER ALEJO'S

00:30:54.485 --> 00:30:57.255
BILL.

00:30:57.322 --> 00:30:59.157
BUT THAT'S WHAT THAT BILL DID

00:30:59.224 --> 00:30:59.457
[inaudible]

00:30:59.524 --> 00:31:02.393
CREATED CURRICULA.

00:31:02.460 --> 00:31:05.597
NOW THAT WE HAVE THAT CURRICULUM

00:31:05.663 --> 00:31:07.265
CORRECT ROUTE [inaudible]

00:31:07.332 --> 00:31:09.300
BY SAYING

00:31:09.367 --> 00:31:11.102
WE HAVE THIS CURRICULUM

00:31:11.169 --> 00:31:12.136
DEVELOPED BY EXPERTS

00:31:12.203 --> 00:31:12.437
[inaudible]

00:31:12.503 --> 00:31:13.972
INPUT.

00:31:14.038 --> 00:31:18.343
BY A BROAD VARIETY OF EXPERTS.

00:31:18.409 --> 00:31:20.712
INCLUDING TEACHERS.

00:31:20.778 --> 00:31:22.580
BUT WE THINK THAT CURRICULUM IS

00:31:22.647 --> 00:31:23.348
IMPORTANT ENOUGH THAT IT SHOULD

00:31:23.414 --> 00:31:25.550
BE TAUGHT.

00:31:25.617 --> 00:31:26.451
EVERYWHERE IN THE STATE OF

00:31:26.517 --> 00:31:28.920
CALIFORNIA.

00:31:28.987 --> 00:31:30.989
AND THAT I DO THINK IS THE ROLE

00:31:31.055 --> 00:31:33.658
OF THE LEGISLATURE. TO SAY WHAT

00:31:33.725 --> 00:31:36.561
SHOULD BE THE REQUIREMENTS

00:31:36.628 --> 00:31:39.864
[inaudible] FOR GRADUATION --

00:31:39.931 --> 00:31:40.832
CERTAINLY FOR HIGH SCHOOL

00:31:40.898 --> 00:31:42.767
STUDENTS.

00:31:42.834 --> 00:31:45.436
AND LATER TODAY THERE IS A BILL

00:31:45.503 --> 00:31:49.474
THAT I AM CO AUTHOR ON ASKING --

00:31:49.540 --> 00:31:51.075
TELLING THE CSU THAT THEY SHOULD

00:31:51.142 --> 00:31:53.711
DO THE SAME.

00:31:53.778 --> 00:31:54.946
AND AND THAT'S AN EVEN BIGGER

00:31:55.013 --> 00:31:57.615
STEP BECAUSE I WAS A COMMUNITY

00:31:57.682 --> 00:31:58.449
COLLEGE TRUSTEE.

00:31:58.516 --> 00:32:01.352
AND RESPECT THE DIFFERENTIATION

00:32:01.419 --> 00:32:04.489
BETWEEN -- GIVING THE FACULTY

00:32:04.555 --> 00:32:04.789
[inaudible]

00:32:04.856 --> 00:32:06.491
POWER.

00:32:06.557 --> 00:32:08.226
IN THE END IN THE COLLEGE LEVEL

00:32:08.293 --> 00:32:11.696
TOOK. TO HAVE ALL THINGS --

00:32:11.763 --> 00:32:14.365
ACADEMIC.

00:32:14.432 --> 00:32:16.000
BUT AS I SAID ALSO IN BEEN THE

00:32:16.067 --> 00:32:17.502
BEGINNING.

00:32:17.568 --> 00:32:20.171
IT IS NOW BEEN FIFTEEN YEARS.

00:32:20.238 --> 00:32:21.673
IT HAS BEEN FIFTY YEARS

00:32:21.739 --> 00:32:21.973
[inaudible]

00:32:22.040 --> 00:32:24.142
SINCE.

00:32:24.208 --> 00:32:26.077
STRUGGLE BECAUSE T CAME OUT OF

00:32:26.144 --> 00:32:26.577
STRUGGLE.

00:32:26.644 --> 00:32:28.446
OF STUDENTS [inaudible]

00:32:28.513 --> 00:32:30.682
DIVERSE STUDENTS.

00:32:30.748 --> 00:32:32.617
WHO STOOD UP AND SAID YOU KNOW

00:32:32.684 --> 00:32:35.887
WE DON'T SEE OURSELVES REFLECTED?

00:32:35.953 --> 00:32:37.555
IN THE TEACHERS IN FRONT OF US

00:32:37.622 --> 00:32:38.956
IN THE COUNSELORS AT THE HIGH

00:32:39.023 --> 00:32:41.559
SCHOOLS IN THE ADMINISTRATORS.

00:32:41.626 --> 00:32:43.861
IN THE CURRICULA SO IT WAS OUT

00:32:43.928 --> 00:32:45.596
OF THAT STRUGGLE THAT THESE

00:32:45.663 --> 00:32:49.133
CLASSES THAT THIS -- CAME OUT OF

00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:51.703
AND WE'VE NOW SEEN FIFTY YEARS.

00:32:51.769 --> 00:32:54.505
WHERE NOTHING IS CHANGED?

00:32:54.572 --> 00:32:56.240
WE WE WE ARE SEEING SOME

00:32:56.307 --> 00:32:59.277
DISTRICTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE

00:32:59.344 --> 00:33:00.178
OF CALIFORNIA SEEING THE VALUE.

00:33:00.244 --> 00:33:01.546
OF TEACHING ETHNIC STUDIES AND

00:33:01.612 --> 00:33:03.147
INCLUDING THEM IN THOSE INCLUDE --

00:33:03.214 --> 00:33:07.685
DAVIS SANTA BARBARA [inaudible]

00:33:07.752 --> 00:33:09.287
LOS ANGELES.

00:33:09.354 --> 00:33:10.955
SO WE'VE SEEN MANY DISTRICTS

00:33:11.022 --> 00:33:13.558
CHOOSE AND AND AND TO MAKE IT A

00:33:13.624 --> 00:33:14.926
REQUIREMENT ON THEIR OWN.

00:33:14.992 --> 00:33:17.829
BUT I DO THINK IT IS THE THE THE

00:33:17.895 --> 00:33:19.130
THE JOB.

00:33:19.197 --> 00:33:21.132
OF THE LEGISLATURE TO LOOK AT

00:33:21.199 --> 00:33:24.068
THINGS HOLISTICALLY AND TO SAY.

00:33:24.135 --> 00:33:25.803
THIS.

00:33:25.870 --> 00:33:27.605
BUT NEEDS TO BE TAUGHT THIS

00:33:27.672 --> 00:33:28.506
SHOULD BE SOMETHING THAT

00:33:28.573 --> 00:33:29.374
EVERYONE.

00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:31.409
IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS

00:33:31.476 --> 00:33:33.845
COMPETENT AS A TEACHER.

MANY DECADES IN THE PAST CAN

00:36:50.074 --> 00:36:52.310
POINT TO OUR OWN STORIES.

EVER HAVING READ ANYTHING.

00:37:12.296 --> 00:37:13.664
IN HISTORY BOOKS OR IN ANY BOOK

00:37:13.731 --> 00:37:14.465
ABOUT THE CONTRIBUTIONS ARE ON

00:37:14.532 --> 00:37:15.900
THE PRESENCE.

00:37:15.967 --> 00:37:18.569
OTHER THAN -- NATIVE AMERICANS

00:37:18.636 --> 00:37:19.103
IN A VERY.

00:37:19.170 --> 00:37:21.238
NOT IN A VERY POSITIVE WAY IN A

00:37:21.305 --> 00:37:21.939
VERY NEGATIVE WAY.

00:37:22.006 --> 00:37:24.508
SO I I APPRECIATE EVERYONE'S --

00:37:24.575 --> 00:37:26.210
ROLE IN MOVING THIS FORWARD -- I

00:37:26.277 --> 00:37:27.111
WOULD.

00:37:27.178 --> 00:37:29.680
I WOULD -- WITH REGARD TO MY

00:37:29.747 --> 00:37:31.716
COLLEAGUE CENTER PANS --

00:37:31.782 --> 00:37:33.951
CONCERNS I WOULD NORMALLY HAVE

00:37:34.018 --> 00:37:36.354
THE SAME CONCERN I WOULD START

00:37:36.420 --> 00:37:37.855
OUT WITH WITH THAT CONCERNED --

00:37:37.922 --> 00:37:40.224
BECAUSE WE DO WANT TO LIMIT WHAT

00:37:40.291 --> 00:37:42.426
THE RULE IS AND MAKE SURE THAT

00:37:42.493 --> 00:37:43.961
IT'S ABSOLUTELY AN ESSENTIAL

00:37:44.028 --> 00:37:46.063
PART OF WHAT.

00:37:46.130 --> 00:37:47.565
OUR RESPONSIBILITIES ARE.

00:37:47.632 --> 00:37:49.333
BUT HAVING BEEN THROUGH THE

00:37:49.400 --> 00:37:51.669
STRUGGLE AND HAVING SEEN THAT

00:37:51.736 --> 00:37:55.339
LIKE YOU SAID AT LEAST FIFTY

00:37:55.406 --> 00:37:56.607
YEARS AGO THAT THE STARTED

00:37:56.674 --> 00:37:58.175
THAT TIME COMES WHEN.

00:37:58.242 --> 00:38:00.378
LEGISLATURE HAS TO STEP IN

00:38:00.444 --> 00:38:02.480
BECAUSE IT'S NOT GETTING DONE

00:38:02.546 --> 00:38:02.780
[inaudible]

00:38:02.847 --> 00:38:06.717
AND WE'RE OF THE MIND WE DO THAT

00:38:06.784 --> 00:38:09.320
IN A NUMBER OF SUBJECTS IN A

00:38:09.387 --> 00:38:10.888
NUMBER OF AREAS.

00:38:10.955 --> 00:38:12.256
WE DO THAT WITH HEALTH WE DO

00:38:12.323 --> 00:38:14.592
THAT WITH OTHER THINGS WHEN IT'S

00:38:14.659 --> 00:38:15.893
NOT GETTING DONE RIGHT.

00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:17.061
GOVERNMENT HAS TO STEP IN TO

00:38:17.128 --> 00:38:21.666
CORRECT IT -- I WOULD PREFER.

00:38:21.732 --> 00:38:25.636
IN A MUCH MUCH OF A BIGGER WAY I

00:38:25.703 --> 00:38:26.904
WOULD PREFER THAT WE DIDN'T HAVE

00:38:26.971 --> 00:38:29.140
THE WE SPOKE OF THE REQUIREMENT

00:38:29.206 --> 00:38:31.876
OF THOSE SPECIFIC ETHNIC STUDIES.

00:38:31.942 --> 00:38:34.111
I WOULD PREFER THAT HISTORY

00:38:34.178 --> 00:38:37.348
BOOKS INCLUDED US WITHOUT HAVING

00:38:37.415 --> 00:38:40.418
ETHNIC STUDIES REQUIRED -- I

00:38:40.484 --> 00:38:42.520
THINK IT'S SHAMEFUL I THINK IT'S

00:38:42.586 --> 00:38:44.188
SHAMEFUL THAT WOMEN'S ROLES THE

00:38:44.255 --> 00:38:47.158
LGBT Q. ROLE THAT THE THE ROLE

00:38:47.224 --> 00:38:49.026
OF ETHNIC GROUPS.

00:38:49.093 --> 00:38:50.695
I THINK IT'S SHAMEFUL THAT OUR

00:38:50.761 --> 00:38:52.930
HISTORY BOOKS DO NOT REFLECT THE

00:38:52.997 --> 00:38:53.597
TRUTH.

00:38:53.664 --> 00:38:55.199
OF WHAT WHAT HAS BEEN THE

00:38:55.266 --> 00:38:57.101
HISTORY OF THIS COUNTRY IN OF

00:38:57.168 --> 00:38:58.002
THE WORLD.

00:38:58.069 --> 00:38:59.937
SO -- I THINK THERE ARE TIMES

00:39:00.004 --> 00:39:02.406
WHEN WE DO HAVE TO STEP IN AND I

00:39:02.473 --> 00:39:04.008
THINK THIS IS ONE OF THOSE FEW

00:39:04.075 --> 00:39:06.777
TIMES SO.

00:39:06.844 --> 00:39:08.012
I APPRECIATE AND SUPPORT YOU.

00:39:08.079 --> 00:39:11.949
VERY GOOD -- I OUT ONE AT SHARE

00:39:12.016 --> 00:39:13.484
MY THOUGHTS AS WELL -- BUT FIRST

00:39:13.551 --> 00:39:14.585
I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR

00:39:14.652 --> 00:39:15.920
LEADERSHIP IN THIS AREA I WANT

00:39:15.986 --> 00:39:17.154
TO THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER LIKE

00:39:17.221 --> 00:39:19.056
HELL FOR HIS LEADERSHIP PRIOR TO

00:39:19.123 --> 00:39:19.857
YOU AND THERE'S SO MANY OTHERS

00:39:19.924 --> 00:39:20.591
WHO HAVE.

00:39:20.658 --> 00:39:22.026
TRIED TO LEAD IN THIS AREA NOT

00:39:22.093 --> 00:39:23.160
NECESSARILY THROUGH LEGISLATION

00:39:23.227 --> 00:39:25.429
BUT THROUGH ACTIVISM ON OUR

00:39:25.496 --> 00:39:26.764
CAMPUSES.

00:39:26.831 --> 00:39:28.599
AND IN OUR COMMUNITIES --

00:39:28.666 --> 00:39:30.434
THERE'S NO DOUBT IN MY MIND THAT

00:39:30.501 --> 00:39:32.937
ETHNIC STUDIES IS A CRITICAL.

00:39:33.003 --> 00:39:35.506
UP POINT OF UNDERSTANDING FOR US

00:39:35.573 --> 00:39:37.341
IN CALIFORNIA FOR US AS A

00:39:37.408 --> 00:39:38.409
SOCIETY.

00:39:38.476 --> 00:39:40.377
THAT -- WITHOUT THAT TYPE OF

00:39:40.444 --> 00:39:42.113
UNDERSTANDING.

00:39:42.179 --> 00:39:43.948
AND TOLERANCE OUR WHOLE COHESION

00:39:44.014 --> 00:39:46.183
AS A COMMUNITY AS A STATE AS A

00:39:46.250 --> 00:39:48.853
COUNTRY AS  WORLD -- IS IS IN

00:39:48.919 --> 00:39:49.820
JEOPARDY.

00:39:49.887 --> 00:39:51.655
AND SO IT IS SO IMPORTANT THAT

00:39:51.722 --> 00:39:55.059
WE HAVE THAT UNDERSTANDING --

00:39:55.126 --> 00:39:56.160
THE DILEMMA FOR ME IN YOUR BILL

00:39:56.227 --> 00:39:59.163
THOUGH IS SIMILAR TO DOCTOR PANS

00:39:59.230 --> 00:40:00.798
THE ISSUE THAT HE HAS RAISED.

00:40:00.865 --> 00:40:02.333
AS I UNDERSTAND IT THE

00:40:02.399 --> 00:40:05.069
LEGISLATURE IN THEIR WISDOM HAS

00:40:05.136 --> 00:40:06.837
A IT HAS DIRECTED.

00:40:06.904 --> 00:40:08.239
THAT MODEL CURRICULUM THE

00:40:08.305 --> 00:40:09.840
ESTABLISHED IN THIS AREA.

00:40:09.907 --> 00:40:11.575
AND THAT WE ARE IN THE PROCESS

00:40:11.642 --> 00:40:13.377
OF DOING THAT RIGHT NOW.

00:40:13.444 --> 00:40:14.912
IT'S COMPLETED SENATOR.

00:40:14.979 --> 00:40:17.414
OKAY ACCORDING TO THE ANALYSIS.

00:40:17.481 --> 00:40:19.884
SAYS THAT THE THE INSTRUCTIONAL

00:40:19.950 --> 00:40:21.819
QUALITY COMMISSION.

00:40:21.886 --> 00:40:23.420

00:40:23.487 --> 00:40:25.389
CURRICULUM BY DECEMBER THIRTY

00:40:25.456 --> 00:40:26.490
FIRST TWENTY NINETEEN HAVE THEY

00:40:26.557 --> 00:40:28.125
ALREADY DONE THAT.

00:40:28.192 --> 00:40:29.794
RIGHT THE GROUP MODEL CURRICULUM

00:40:29.860 --> 00:40:31.428
AS HAS BEEN COMPLETED.

00:40:31.495 --> 00:40:33.864
I IT IS NOW MY UNDERSTANDING AND

00:40:33.931 --> 00:40:35.332
IF THERE'S ANYONE HERE FROM THE

00:40:35.399 --> 00:40:36.867
DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION THE MY

00:40:36.934 --> 00:40:37.668
CORRECT ME.

00:40:37.735 --> 00:40:39.003
BUT THE THE MODEL CURRICULUM HAS

00:40:39.069 --> 00:40:40.638
BEEN COMPLETED.

00:40:40.704 --> 00:40:42.239
IT'S ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED PAGES

00:40:42.306 --> 00:40:44.809
IT'S ON MY DESK -- AND IT IS NOW

00:40:44.875 --> 00:40:47.278
LOOK -- THE TIME FOR PUBLIC

00:40:47.344 --> 00:40:48.579
REVIEW.

00:40:48.646 --> 00:40:49.180
OF THAT MODEL GET KILLED AND

00:40:49.246 --> 00:40:50.681
THAT THAT THAT'S CONSISTENT WITH

00:40:50.748 --> 00:40:52.082
THE ANALYSIS THE HOUSES SAYS

00:40:52.149 --> 00:40:53.450
THAT THERE'S A DEADLINE FOR

00:40:53.517 --> 00:40:54.885
COMPLETING THE DRAFT IT'S GOING

00:40:54.952 --> 00:40:57.321
THROUGH THAT.

00:40:57.388 --> 00:40:58.556
REVIEW PROCESS THAT THE THE

00:40:58.622 --> 00:40:59.957
STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION HAS TO

00:41:00.024 --> 00:41:01.292
ADOPT THE CURRICULUM.

00:41:01.358 --> 00:41:03.661
BY MARCH THIRTY FIRST TWENTY

00:41:03.727 --> 00:41:04.695
TWENTY SO WE HAVE A PROCESS IN

00:41:04.762 --> 00:41:07.097
PLACE YOU JUST ACKNOWLEDGE THAT

00:41:07.164 --> 00:41:08.232
THAT WHICH IS GOOD.

00:41:08.299 --> 00:41:10.668
THAT THEY'RE TRYING TO PROVIDE.

00:41:10.734 --> 00:41:12.136
A AT WITH GOOD WISDOM THIS MODEL

00:41:12.203 --> 00:41:13.637
CURRICULUM FOR HOW THE SCHOOLS

00:41:13.704 --> 00:41:16.440
CAN TEACH ETHNIC STUDIES RIGHT.

00:41:16.507 --> 00:41:17.808
AND THE EFFORT TO TRY TO PROMOTE

00:41:17.875 --> 00:41:19.276
AND ENCOURAGE OUR SCHOOL

00:41:19.343 --> 00:41:20.444
DISTRICTS TO TEACH ETHNIC

00:41:20.511 --> 00:41:21.645
STUDIES SO THAT.

00:41:21.712 --> 00:41:24.715
THAT PROCESS IS IS IS GOING.

00:41:24.782 --> 00:41:25.883
AHEAD.

00:41:25.950 --> 00:41:28.786
AND WITH THE MARCH. TWENTY

00:41:28.853 --> 00:41:29.854
TWENTY DEADLINE FOR THE STATE

00:41:29.920 --> 00:41:31.655
BOARD OF EDUCATION TO ENGAGE SO

00:41:31.722 --> 00:41:33.657
THE DILEMMA FOR ME IS IS THAT

00:41:33.724 --> 00:41:34.792
TYPICALLY WHEN -- THAT THE

00:41:34.859 --> 00:41:35.926
QUESTION OF IS THERE A

00:41:35.993 --> 00:41:38.329
COMPELLING STATE NEED FOR US TO

00:41:38.395 --> 00:41:38.896
GET INVOLVED IN ALL KINDS OF

00:41:38.963 --> 00:41:39.864
THINGS.

00:41:39.930 --> 00:41:42.700
YOU HAVE TO LOOK AND SAY OKAY.

00:41:42.766 --> 00:41:44.268
WHAT'S THE PROGRESS OF THE WORK

00:41:44.335 --> 00:41:45.603
BEING DONE.

00:41:45.669 --> 00:41:47.438
AND ARE THERE ROAD BLOCKS TO IT

00:41:47.504 --> 00:41:48.806
THAT WE SHOULD BE AWARE OF EYES

00:41:48.873 --> 00:41:50.641
ARE OPPOSITION TO IT THAT WE

00:41:50.708 --> 00:41:52.109
SHOULD BE AWARE OF HAVE SCHOOL

00:41:52.176 --> 00:41:53.978
DISTRICTS HAD THE CHANCE TO

00:41:54.044 --> 00:41:55.679
ENACT THIS AND THEY HAVEN'T.

00:41:55.746 --> 00:41:58.015
TAKEN THOSE STEPS THESE ARE ALL

00:41:58.082 --> 00:41:58.649
THE QUESTIONS THAT GO THROUGH MY

00:41:58.716 --> 00:41:59.917
HEAD.

00:41:59.984 --> 00:42:01.852
AND I GUESS THAT THAT LEAVES ME.

00:42:01.919 --> 00:42:03.988
SHORT TO THE EXTENT THAT.

00:42:04.054 --> 00:42:05.322
WE HAVEN'T EVEN GIVEN THAT MODEL

00:42:05.389 --> 00:42:06.690
CURRICULUM YET.

00:42:06.757 --> 00:42:08.192
THAT THERE HASN'T BEEN THE

00:42:08.259 --> 00:42:09.660
ENGAGEMENT THAT I'M AWARE OF AND

00:42:09.727 --> 00:42:11.295
MAYBE YOU CAN SHARE -- WHAT YOU

00:42:11.362 --> 00:42:12.596
NOW?

00:42:12.663 --> 00:42:13.464
WHERE SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT SAID

00:42:13.530 --> 00:42:15.399
NO NO NO NO NO WE HAVE A

00:42:15.466 --> 00:42:16.533
THOUSAND SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAVE

00:42:16.600 --> 00:42:18.202
WE GIVEN THE CHANCE TO DO THE

00:42:18.269 --> 00:42:20.237
RIGHT THING -- BECAUSE CLEARLY

00:42:20.304 --> 00:42:22.840
THEIR WORK IS LACKING I WE AGREE.

00:42:22.907 --> 00:42:24.441
BUT I SEE HOW MANY KIDS ARE

00:42:24.508 --> 00:42:26.277
TAKING AT THINK STUDIES 1%

00:42:26.343 --> 00:42:27.478
THAT'S EMBARRASSING.

00:42:27.544 --> 00:42:28.979
AND IS THAT OUR FAULT WE'RE

00:42:29.046 --> 00:42:29.780
WE'RE NOT PROVIDING THAT

00:42:29.847 --> 00:42:31.282
CURRICULUM OR IS OR SOME OTHER

00:42:31.348 --> 00:42:32.816
PLACE WHERE WE CAN BE WORKING

00:42:32.883 --> 00:42:34.151
TOGETHER TO MAKE THAT BETTER.

00:42:34.218 --> 00:42:35.386
BUT THAT'S REALLY MY FIRST

00:42:35.452 --> 00:42:37.187
QUESTION TO YOU IS IS WHAT WHAT

00:42:37.254 --> 00:42:38.989
HAVE WE DONE TO GIVE THE SCHOOL

00:42:39.056 --> 00:42:41.692
DISTRICTS THEIR ABILITY TO DO

00:42:41.759 --> 00:42:42.293
THE RIGHT THING BEFORE WE STEP

00:42:42.359 --> 00:42:44.495
IN.

00:42:44.561 --> 00:42:46.597
SOME SCHOOL DISTRICTS LIKE DAVIS

00:42:46.664 --> 00:42:48.265
THAT RECENTLY ADOPTED ETHNIC

00:42:48.332 --> 00:42:50.034
STUDIES.

00:42:50.100 --> 00:42:52.069
AS RECENT AS LAST MONTH.

00:42:52.136 --> 00:42:53.837
HAVE SAID WHY WAIT FOR THIS

00:42:53.904 --> 00:42:56.240
LEGISLATION TO GET PAST AND THEY

00:42:56.307 --> 00:42:58.008
HAVE SAID THAT AT THEIR MEETINGS.

00:42:58.075 --> 00:42:59.543
AT THEIR BOARD MEETINGS AND WE

00:42:59.610 --> 00:43:01.912
SAW HERE -- A SEVERAL SCHOOL

00:43:01.979 --> 00:43:04.315
BOARD MEMBERS IN SUPPORT OF A OF

00:43:04.381 --> 00:43:07.418
THIS BILL.

00:43:07.484 --> 00:43:08.919
I I I KNOW THAT.

00:43:08.986 --> 00:43:10.888
I I WOULD SAY THAT EVERYONE HERE

00:43:10.955 --> 00:43:13.424
WHO'S TESTIFIED -- WHICH SHARE

00:43:13.490 --> 00:43:15.125
MY OWN CONCERN.

00:43:15.192 --> 00:43:17.661
THAT IT IS ONE THING TO CREATE

00:43:17.728 --> 00:43:18.996
CURRICULUM FOR DEPARTMENT OF

00:43:19.063 --> 00:43:21.398
EDUCATION IS ANOTHER THING TO

00:43:21.465 --> 00:43:22.733
IMPLEMENT THAT CURRICULA

00:43:22.800 --> 00:43:23.033
[inaudible]

00:43:23.100 --> 00:43:24.568
AND SO.

00:43:24.635 --> 00:43:25.736
DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION

00:43:25.803 --> 00:43:27.705
SOMETIMES CREATES CURRICULUM

00:43:27.771 --> 00:43:30.040
LIKE THEY DID FOR THE SEVEN SAYS

00:43:30.107 --> 00:43:32.276
ARE CHAVEZ HOLIDAY.

00:43:32.343 --> 00:43:35.346
OR PERHAPS THE WHOLE COST.

00:43:35.412 --> 00:43:37.047
BUT IT IS ANOTHER THING TO SEE

00:43:37.114 --> 00:43:38.482
THAT CURRICULUM IMPLEMENTED IN

00:43:38.549 --> 00:43:40.451
THE DISTRICTS.

00:43:40.517 --> 00:43:43.487
AND AND I WOULD BE VERY HAPPY.

00:43:43.554 --> 00:43:45.990
IF EVERY ONE OF THOSE ONE

00:43:46.056 --> 00:43:47.157
THOUSAND SCHOOL DISTRICTS ACROSS

00:43:47.224 --> 00:43:48.959
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

00:43:49.026 --> 00:43:50.828
DID LIKE DAVIS.

00:43:50.894 --> 00:43:53.063
OR SANTA BARBARA.

00:43:53.130 --> 00:43:54.932
AND ON THEIR OWN SAID WE WERE

00:43:54.999 --> 00:43:58.035
GOING TO DO THIS.

00:43:58.102 --> 00:43:59.703
BUT I THINK THEY'VE HAD TIME TO

00:43:59.770 --> 00:44:01.605
DO THAT ALREADY.

00:44:01.672 --> 00:44:04.074
YOU KNOW IT'S BEEN AGAIN FIFTY

00:44:04.141 --> 00:44:07.211
YEARS.

00:44:07.277 --> 00:44:08.479
I AM NOT GONNA LIVE ANOTHER

00:44:08.545 --> 00:44:09.880
FIFTY YEARS.

00:44:09.947 --> 00:44:12.282
BUT I WOULD HATE.

00:44:12.349 --> 00:44:14.284
THAT MY GREAT GRAND CHILDREN

00:44:14.351 --> 00:44:15.953
WOULD STILL BE HAVING THE SAME

00:44:16.020 --> 00:44:17.354
CLASSES.

00:44:17.421 --> 00:44:19.790
BEING TAUGHT THE SAME THINGS

00:44:19.857 --> 00:44:21.091
THAT ARE BEING TAUGHT TODAY

00:44:21.158 --> 00:44:21.392
[inaudible]

00:44:21.458 --> 00:44:26.363
I WOULD RESPECTFULLY SAY THAT.

00:44:26.430 --> 00:44:28.065
WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO DO IS GET

00:44:28.132 --> 00:44:30.300
BOTH THINGS ON AT THE SAME TIME

00:44:30.367 --> 00:44:31.468
THAT WHEN THE CURRICULUM IS IS

00:44:31.535 --> 00:44:33.037
READY?

00:44:33.103 --> 00:44:34.671
BECAUSE OUR BILL SAYS THAT THIS

00:44:34.738 --> 00:44:36.640
WOULD BECOME A HIGH SCHOOL

00:44:36.707 --> 00:44:40.944
GRADUATE XIN REQUIREMENT AND

00:44:41.011 --> 00:44:41.578
TWENTY TWENTY FOUR TWENTY TWENTY

00:44:41.645 --> 00:44:42.212
FIVE GIVING SCHOOL DISTRICTS.

00:44:42.279 --> 00:44:44.715
AMPLE TIME TO PREPARE TRAIN

00:44:44.782 --> 00:44:46.683
THEIR TEACHERS.

00:44:46.750 --> 00:44:48.619
GET THE CURRICULUM SO WE ARE

00:44:48.685 --> 00:44:50.087

00:44:50.154 --> 00:44:51.889
DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION.

00:44:51.955 --> 00:44:53.357
AS AS YOU NOTED [inaudible]

00:44:53.424 --> 00:44:55.192
THEY ARE.

00:44:55.259 --> 00:44:57.828
A SPONSOR OF THIS BILL.

00:44:57.895 --> 00:44:59.096
AND TONY THURMOND STATE

00:44:59.163 --> 00:45:00.864
SUPERINTENDENT WAS WITH ME --

00:45:00.931 --> 00:45:02.833
WHEN HE WHEN WE PRESENTED THIS

00:45:02.900 --> 00:45:06.203
BILL IN THE -- ASSEMBLY THEY ARE

THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP

00:45:08.172 --> 00:45:10.007
AND SI I THINK THAT THAT IS THE

00:45:10.074 --> 00:45:11.742
ISSUE THAT GIVES ME PAUSE NOT

00:45:11.809 --> 00:45:13.544
ABOUT THE BELIEF AND THE DESIRE.

00:45:13.610 --> 00:45:14.878
TO HAVE THAT UNDERSTANDING THAT

00:45:14.945 --> 00:45:16.413
BROADER UNDERSTANDING OF OUR OF

00:45:16.480 --> 00:45:18.515
OUR WORLD AND OUR CLASSES BUT

00:45:18.582 --> 00:45:18.916
THAT.

00:45:18.982 --> 00:45:20.984
THAT WE SEEM TO BE ON ATTRACTED

00:45:21.051 --> 00:45:22.619

00:45:22.686 --> 00:45:23.987
AND THAT HOPEFULLY HAVE OURS ARE

00:45:24.054 --> 00:45:25.956
EDUCATIONAL LEADERS TAKE THE

00:45:26.023 --> 00:45:27.091
RIGHT STEPS TO INCORPORATED.

00:45:27.157 --> 00:45:28.692
AND I THINK THAT'S A BETTER

00:45:28.759 --> 00:45:30.561
PROCESS TO PLAY OUT THAN US

00:45:30.627 --> 00:45:32.930
CREATING A MANDATE -- RIGHT UP

00:45:32.996 --> 00:45:34.198
FRONT EVEN THOUGH FOR SUCH A

00:45:39.136 --> 00:45:39.803
MY CONCLUDING COMMENTS.

ALEJO'S HAD THIS BILL WHEN I

00:45:50.647 --> 00:45:52.616
FIRST CAME TO THE SENATE AND I

00:45:52.683 --> 00:45:54.518
WAS HAPPY TO VOTE FOR THEN.

00:45:54.585 --> 00:45:56.253
I VOTED FOR YOUR BILL LAST YEAR

00:45:56.320 --> 00:45:56.987
I WILL BE SUPPORTING IT THIS

00:45:57.054 --> 00:45:58.188

WE ARE WORKING ON MODEL

00:45:59.256 --> 00:46:00.991
CURRICULUM BUT I THINK WHAT I

00:46:01.058 --> 00:46:02.159
WORRY ABOUT IS EXACTLY WHAT YOU

00:46:02.226 --> 00:46:04.027

FIFTY YEARS AND SOMETIMES WE

00:46:06.096 --> 00:46:07.998
CANNOT RELY ON PEOPLE AND WAIT

00:46:08.065 --> 00:46:09.032
FOR THEM TO DO THE RIGHT THING

00:46:09.099 --> 00:46:09.867
OUT OF THE GOODNESS OF THEIR

00:46:09.933 --> 00:46:10.667
HEART.

00:46:10.734 --> 00:46:13.370
AND OUR JOB IS TO LEGISLATE AND

00:46:13.437 --> 00:46:15.472
LEGISLATING THIS IS MEANING THAT

00:46:15.539 --> 00:46:17.341
PEOPLE WILL BE FORCED TO LEARN

00:46:17.407 --> 00:46:19.409
ABOUT EACH OTHER AND GUESS WHAT

00:46:19.476 --> 00:46:20.777
WHEN WE LEARN ABOUT EACH OTHER

00:46:20.844 --> 00:46:22.045
WE'RE GOING TO DISCOVER THAT WE

00:46:22.112 --> 00:46:23.580
HAVE MORE IN COMMON.

00:46:23.647 --> 00:46:25.349
THAN NOT A MAYBE IT WILL CREATE

00:46:25.415 --> 00:46:26.917
A BETTER WORLD BECAUSE THEN WILL

00:46:26.984 --> 00:46:28.452

LOOK AT IT IN TERMS OF THAT

01:37:54.568 --> 01:37:55.769

THE FIRST TIME IT'S EVER BEEN

01:37:56.971 --> 01:37:58.072
RECOMMENDED IT'S BEEN

01:37:58.138 --> 01:37:59.139
RECOMMENDED BEFORE.

01:37:59.206 --> 01:38:00.708

KNOW OF WHERE THEY HAVE

01:38:12.886 --> 01:38:14.655
SYSTEMATICALLY DECIDED HOW THEY

01:38:14.722 --> 01:38:16.323

OVER THAN A NUMBER OF YEARS.

01:38:17.958 --> 01:38:19.860
SO THE RECOMMENDATION IS THERE

01:38:19.927 --> 01:38:21.595

PUSH IT A LITTLE BIT MORE ON

01:38:31.171 --> 01:38:32.273
THEIR CAMPUSES HAVE MET

01:38:32.339 --> 01:38:34.708
RESISTANCE OF COURSE -- A FEW

01:38:34.775 --> 01:38:37.344
HAVE BEEN ABLE -- TO WHO ALREADY

01:38:37.411 --> 01:38:39.313
HAVE IN PLACE A STRUCTURE THAT

01:38:39.380 --> 01:38:40.881
ALLOWS IT TO HAPPEN TO HAVE BEEN

01:38:40.948 --> 01:38:42.549
ABLE TO DO SOMETHING WITH IT --

01:38:42.616 --> 01:38:44.618
BUT IT HAS NOT BEEN COME A MAJOR

01:38:44.685 --> 01:38:46.253
ISSUE STATEWIDE THAT WE CAN

01:38:46.320 --> 01:38:47.588
EMBRACE AND SAY OKAY THEY'VE

01:38:47.655 --> 01:38:48.589
TAKEN THE RECOMMENDATION IN A

01:38:48.656 --> 01:38:50.557
MOVING FORWARD WITH IT -- IT'S

01:38:50.624 --> 01:38:53.027
NOT THE YEAR AND SO -- SO YOU

01:38:53.093 --> 01:38:54.428
DON'T HAVE A PLAN THAT'S BEING

01:38:54.495 --> 01:38:56.297
LAID OUT BY THE THE ACADEMIC

01:38:56.363 --> 01:38:58.532
SENATE -- TO IMPLEMENT THIS

01:38:58.599 --> 01:39:00.134
PARTICULAR PROPOSAL.

01:39:00.200 --> 01:39:01.335
SO I I KNOW YOU'RE SPEAKING

01:39:01.402 --> 01:39:03.604
ABOUT THE STATE WIDE I THINK

01:39:03.671 --> 01:39:04.138
YOU'RE SPEAKING ABOUT THE

01:39:04.204 --> 01:39:05.172
STATEWIDE ACADEMIC.

01:39:05.239 --> 01:39:06.307
BUT I'M REALLY INTERESTED IN THE

01:39:06.373 --> 01:39:09.109
CAMPUS BY CAMPUS CHOICE SO OTHER

01:39:09.176 --> 01:39:09.610
WORDS.

01:39:09.677 --> 01:39:10.811
I HEAR THAT ALREADY WHO'VE

01:39:10.878 --> 01:39:12.680
ALWAYS DONE THAT WHO'S ALWAYS

01:39:12.746 --> 01:39:14.081
HAD ETHNIC STUDIES OR I SHOULD

01:39:14.148 --> 01:39:16.283
SAY A MULTI CULTURAL STUDIES

01:39:16.350 --> 01:39:18.152
COMPONENT WHICH IS DIFFERENT

01:39:18.218 --> 01:39:19.887
THAN AN ETHNIC STUDIES COMPONENT.

01:39:19.953 --> 01:39:21.355
ALL AND AND IT SAID IT WILL

01:39:21.422 --> 01:39:23.557
STATE WE HAD A MULTI CULTURAL

01:39:23.624 --> 01:39:25.159
REQUIREMENT THAT WAS THE ACOSTA

01:39:25.225 --> 01:39:27.061
CULTURE WHATEVER IT WAS.

01:39:27.127 --> 01:39:28.696
AND IT COULD BE SATISFIED IN A

01:39:28.762 --> 01:39:30.364
MULTITUDE OF WAYS THAT WOULD

01:39:30.431 --> 01:39:32.666
NEVER CAUSE THEM TO EVER ADDRESS

01:39:32.733 --> 01:39:39.473
THE ISSUES OF PEOPLE OF COLOR IN

01:39:39.540 --> 01:39:41.942
CALIFORNIA -- WE COULD YOU COULD

01:39:42.009 --> 01:39:42.543
TAKE IT BY STUDYING SOUTHERN

01:39:42.609 --> 01:39:43.444
EUROPEANS OR WHATEVER YOU WANTED

01:39:43.510 --> 01:39:44.044
THAT THAT HAVE SOME DIVERSITY

01:39:44.111 --> 01:39:44.845
COMPONENT BUT ABILITY TO

01:39:44.912 --> 01:39:46.580
ACTUALLY DEAL WITH THE ISSUES OF

01:39:46.647 --> 01:39:48.649
OF RACE AND AND AND AND

01:39:48.716 --> 01:39:50.517
ETHNICITY IN CALIFORNIA IN THE

01:39:50.584 --> 01:39:51.785
UNITED STATES AND THE ISSUE THAT

01:39:51.852 --> 01:39:52.353
IT.

01:39:52.419 --> 01:39:54.621
IMPACTS THEIR LIVES DALY OF THAT

01:39:54.688 --> 01:39:55.823
WAS NOT YOU COULD GET A WAY YOU

01:39:55.889 --> 01:39:57.324
COULD GET OUT OF THE UNIVERSITY

01:39:57.391 --> 01:39:59.693
WITHOUT EVER TECH TAKING THAT

01:39:59.760 --> 01:40:00.160
SUBJECT MATTER.

01:40:00.227 --> 01:40:02.196
AND AND THAT IS ONE OF THE

01:40:02.262 --> 01:40:03.464
CONCERNS THAT IF WE'RE GOING TO

01:40:03.530 --> 01:40:04.898
REALLY ADDRESS THE ISSUES THAT

01:40:04.965 --> 01:40:06.300
WE FACE EVERY DAY.

01:40:06.367 --> 01:40:07.501
THAT WE SEE EVERYDAY IN OUR

01:40:07.568 --> 01:40:09.336
CLASSROOMS AND ARE IN IN THE

01:40:09.403 --> 01:40:11.004
PLACES WHERE WE LIVE YOU HAVE TO

01:40:11.071 --> 01:40:12.773
BEGIN TO BASICALLY CRACKED OPEN

01:40:12.840 --> 01:40:14.541
THAT IT CAN BEGIN TO ENGAGE IN

01:40:14.608 --> 01:40:15.542
THAT CONVERSATION.

01:40:15.609 --> 01:40:17.411
AND NOT NOT DIVERT YOUR INTEREST

01:40:17.478 --> 01:40:18.545
IN OTHER AREAS AND SAY ALWAYS

01:40:18.612 --> 01:40:20.981
SATISFIED BECAUSE WE TOOK A

01:40:21.048 --> 01:40:21.715
COURSE IN.

01:40:21.782 --> 01:40:22.349
SOME SOME OTHER COUNTRY

01:40:22.416 --> 01:40:24.051
SOMEWHERE ELSE WITHOUT ACTUALLY

01:40:24.118 --> 01:40:25.519
TOUCHING THE CALIPHATE THE

01:40:25.586 --> 01:40:27.221
YELLOW CALIFORNIA OR THE OR THE

01:40:27.287 --> 01:40:29.623
USE UNITED STATES ISSUES.

01:40:29.690 --> 01:40:30.891
RIGHT BUT MY QUESTION REALLY IS

01:40:30.958 --> 01:40:32.459
TRYING TO ADDRESS.

01:40:32.526 --> 01:40:34.428
I THE COMPELLING NEED FOR US TO

01:40:34.495 --> 01:40:36.497
ACT AS A LEGISLATURE WE CAN

01:40:36.563 --> 01:40:37.631
BECAUSE WE WE JUST MADE TO MEET

01:40:37.698 --> 01:40:38.599
THEM IS FINISHED -- BECAUSE OF

01:40:38.665 --> 01:40:40.768
AN ABSENCE OF ACTIONS ON THE

01:40:40.834 --> 01:40:42.102
CAMPUS IS TO SHOW THAT

01:40:42.169 --> 01:40:44.171
SENSITIVITY AND IN SOME CASES TO

01:40:44.238 --> 01:40:46.206
ADOPT THAT AS A REQUIREMENT IN

01:40:46.273 --> 01:40:47.808
GENERAL EDUCATION.

01:40:47.875 --> 01:40:49.009
AND THAT FOR ME AT LEAST IT'S

01:40:49.076 --> 01:40:50.778
LIKE WE'VE TWENTY THREE CAMPUSES

01:40:50.844 --> 01:40:51.912

01:40:51.979 --> 01:40:53.914
EACH WITH ACADEMIC SENATE'S ON

01:40:53.981 --> 01:40:54.515
EACH.

01:40:54.581 --> 01:40:56.417
AND SO FOR ME TO TRY TO GET TO

01:40:56.483 --> 01:41:01.155
THIS HIGHER BAR -- AND PRATT

01:41:01.221 --> 01:41:02.189
PRECEDENT SETTING BAR.

01:41:02.256 --> 01:41:03.223
I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND --

01:41:25.412 --> 01:41:26.547
OF ETHNIC STUDIES.

01:41:26.613 --> 01:41:28.415
AND AND THAT FIFTY YEARS IS NOT

01:41:28.482 --> 01:41:29.850
FIFTY YEARS OF IDLE ACTIVITY.

01:41:35.789 --> 01:41:37.324
PERSISTENT AND CONSISTENT

01:41:37.391 --> 01:41:39.393
DISCUSSIONS OF ETHNIC STUDIES ON

01:41:39.460 --> 01:41:42.062
THOSE CAMPUSES AND INCLUSION OF

01:41:51.305 --> 01:41:52.706
THERE ON ALL THE CAMPUS AND IT

01:41:52.773 --> 01:41:53.974
ALWAYS HAS BEEN.

01:41:54.041 --> 01:41:55.375
AND AFTER FIFTY YEARS OF THAT

01:41:55.442 --> 01:41:56.944
WHEN I CAME TO THE LEGISLATURE

01:41:57.010 --> 01:41:58.412
AUTHORED THE FIRST PIECE OF

01:41:58.479 --> 01:41:59.680
LEGISLATION THAT WAS A A

01:41:59.746 --> 01:42:01.315
RESOLUTION CONCERNING ETHNIC

01:42:01.381 --> 01:42:02.049

01:42:02.115 --> 01:42:03.817
AND OUT OF THAT RESOLUTION WE

01:42:03.884 --> 01:42:05.085
HAD A HEARING APPEAR OUT OF THE

01:42:05.152 --> 01:42:06.787

WE HAVE THE NEEDS TO BE

01:42:14.228 --> 01:42:14.595
ADDRESSED.

01:42:14.661 --> 01:42:16.129

THERE IS AN EVAN FLOW TO OUR

01:45:18.945 --> 01:45:21.381
POLITICAL SYSTEM -- THAT -- IS

01:45:21.448 --> 01:45:23.583
SOMETIMES COMFORTABLE DO OBSERVE --

01:45:23.650 --> 01:45:24.851
BECAUSE WE OBVIOUSLY WOULD LIKE

01:45:24.918 --> 01:45:26.153
IT TO BE THE WHERE IS TODAY

01:45:26.219 --> 01:45:26.853
RIGHT.

01:45:26.920 --> 01:45:28.822
AND IN PREVIOUS LEGISLATURE'S

01:45:28.889 --> 01:45:29.890
THERE'VE BEEN PEOPLE IN CHARGE

01:45:29.956 --> 01:45:31.992
THAT HAVEN'T BEEN LIKE YOU ARE

01:45:32.059 --> 01:45:37.864

TO GO TOO FAR BACK AND SO.

01:45:39.366 --> 01:45:40.100
YET THERE IS A POTENTIAL IN THE

01:45:40.167 --> 01:45:41.635
FUTURE EVEN THOUGH WE WOULDN'T

01:45:41.702 --> 01:45:42.169
EXPECT OR HOPE FOR IS.

01:45:42.235 --> 01:45:43.036
THAT THE FOLKS THAT ARE UP HERE

01:45:43.103 --> 01:45:44.905
AT THE DAIS -- ARE GONNA BE AT

01:45:44.971 --> 01:45:45.706
FOLKS WITH A DIFFERENT

01:45:45.772 --> 01:45:47.307
PHILOSOPHY PHILOSOPHICAL VIEW

01:45:47.374 --> 01:45:49.810
ABOUT OUR CAMPUSES IN ACADEMIC

01:45:49.876 --> 01:45:51.845
FREEDOM AND THE CHOICES THAT --

01:45:51.912 --> 01:45:53.880
MAYBE THEY WANT TO MAKE ABOUT --

01:45:53.947 --> 01:45:54.648
MANDATES THAT THEY WANT TO

01:45:54.715 --> 01:45:56.717
REQUIRE WE HAVE NEVER PROVIDED

01:45:56.783 --> 01:45:58.685
THIS TYPE OF A MANDATE BEFORE IT

01:45:58.752 --> 01:46:02.189
IS AN BY WORRY A SLIPPERY SLOPE.

01:46:02.255 --> 01:46:03.557
IN TERMS OF WHAT WOULD COME NEXT

01:46:03.623 --> 01:46:05.125
I'M NOT BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF

01:46:05.192 --> 01:46:06.860
MERIT BUT BECAUSE OF WE HAVE A

01:46:06.927 --> 01:46:08.395
PROCESS IN PLACE WE HAVE A BOARD

01:46:08.462 --> 01:46:10.063
OF TRUSTEES WHICH IS A VERY

01:46:10.130 --> 01:46:11.565
DIVERSE BOARD OF TRUSTEES.

01:46:11.631 --> 01:46:13.166
WE HAVE CAMPUS LEADERSHIP WITH

01:46:13.233 --> 01:46:14.768
GREAT DIVERSITY NOW

01:46:14.835 --> 01:46:16.203
UNPRECEDENTED.

01:46:16.269 --> 01:46:17.337
MORE THAN HALF OF THE UNIVERSITY

01:46:17.404 --> 01:46:20.474
PRESIDENTS ARE WOMEN TODAY AT

01:46:20.540 --> 01:46:21.074
THE CSU.

HAVE A LOT MORE WORK TO DO ON

01:46:21.975 --> 01:46:23.810
DIVERSITY WITHIN OUR FACULTY AND

01:46:23.877 --> 01:46:24.478
I KNOW THAT'S AN ONGOING

01:46:24.544 --> 01:46:25.412
CHALLENGE.

01:46:25.479 --> 01:46:26.847
IT WAS I WAS HEARTENING TO HEAR

01:46:26.913 --> 01:46:28.648
EARLIER IN TESTIMONY THAT AS A

01:46:28.715 --> 01:46:30.817
PART OF THE PRESIDENTIAL REVIEW

01:46:30.884 --> 01:46:32.152
THAT THIS ISSUE IS A PART OF

01:46:32.219 --> 01:46:33.253
THOSE STANDARDS AND I KNOW I

01:46:33.320 --> 01:46:34.654
SAID AS A TRUSTEE DURING THOSE

01:46:34.721 --> 01:46:35.555
REVIEWS.

01:46:35.622 --> 01:46:36.556
AND THOSE THINGS ARE TAKEN VERY

01:46:36.623 --> 01:46:37.791
SERIOUSLY IN TERMS OF THE

01:46:37.858 --> 01:46:39.493
LEADERSHIP OF THE CAMPUS.

01:46:39.559 --> 01:46:41.061
IN THESE TYPES OF AREAS.

01:46:41.128 --> 01:46:42.295
AND SO I JUST WANT TO INSURE

01:46:42.362 --> 01:46:43.663
THAT THAT OBSERVATION THAT AS

01:46:43.730 --> 01:46:45.132

WOULD LIKE TO SEE IT.

01:46:48.135 --> 01:46:49.369
TOO THERE IS A VERY SLIPPERY

01:46:49.436 --> 01:46:51.171
SLOPE WE GET ON WITH THESE TYPES

01:46:51.238 --> 01:46:53.707
OF MANDATES AND AGAIN THAT'S NOT

01:46:53.774 --> 01:46:54.641

01:47:30.177 --> 01:47:31.545
A INTO A NOTED WE ARE NOWHERE

01:47:31.611 --> 01:47:35.448
NEAR THE IDEAL -- THAT.

01:47:35.515 --> 01:47:36.550
THAT IT MEETS INTEGRATED

01:47:36.616 --> 01:47:38.652
TOGETHER THE FACT THAT IT'S NOT

01:47:38.718 --> 01:47:40.854
MEANS THAT'S WHY WE NEED TO HAVE

01:47:40.921 --> 01:47:44.157
I THINK STUDIES -- SO I GUESS

01:47:44.224 --> 01:47:45.792

THE STATE WHAT ECONOMIC SENATE

WILL TAKE THIS UP AND AND WILL

01:52:01.381 --> 01:52:02.782
HAVE TAKEN A POSITION ON IT

01:52:02.849 --> 01:52:03.716
BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE THE

01:52:03.783 --> 01:52:04.451
AUTHORITY TO DO THAT IN THE

01:52:04.517 --> 01:52:06.119
STATE WHAT SENATE DOES NOT HAVE

01:52:06.186 --> 01:52:07.854
THE AUTHORITY TO DO THAT.

01:52:07.921 --> 01:52:10.557
OKAY AND IS THAT SOMETHING OKAY

01:52:10.623 --> 01:52:11.858
FOR THOSE THAT THERE WAS A

01:52:11.925 --> 01:52:16.029
CHANCE ARE DONE IS THAT

01:52:16.096 --> 01:52:17.564
SOMETHING THE CHANCEL CALL.

01:52:17.630 --> 01:52:18.231
FOR SO WE WE DO HAVE INFORMATION

01:52:18.298 --> 01:52:19.332
THAT LAYS OUT EXACTLY HOW EACH

01:52:19.399 --> 01:52:21.935
CAMPUS HAS BEEN AND HAS NOT BEEN

01:52:22.001 --> 01:52:23.303
RESPONSIVE TO EACH AND AND I

01:52:23.369 --> 01:52:24.471
KNOW THE QUESTION I ASKED IS

01:52:24.537 --> 01:52:26.272
THAT TAKING UP THIS VERY ISSUE

01:52:26.339 --> 01:52:27.674
OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE

01:52:27.740 --> 01:52:29.075
REPORT AND HAVING THE SENATE

01:52:29.142 --> 01:52:30.743
SIDE LIKE TO DEFER. TO THE

01:52:30.810 --> 01:52:31.478
SENATE BUT THE SENSE NOT

01:52:31.544 --> 01:52:33.346
ACTUALLY GOING TO ACT ON IT AND

01:52:33.413 --> 01:52:34.681
EVEN DEBATE AT THE END THAT'S

01:52:34.747 --> 01:52:35.648
CONCERNING TO ME.

01:52:35.715 --> 01:52:36.850
AND IT'S BEEN THREE YEARS SINCE

01:52:36.916 --> 01:52:38.151
A REPORT CAME OUT.

01:52:38.218 --> 01:52:39.719
THE THE BASIS OF MY STATEMENT IS

01:52:39.786 --> 01:52:41.020
SAYING THAT WE ALREADY HAVE SOME

01:52:41.087 --> 01:52:42.689
INFORMATION THAT WE CAN SHARE

01:52:42.755 --> 01:52:44.023

01:52:44.090 --> 01:52:46.259
CAMPUSES THAT HAVE TAKEN IT UP.

01:52:46.326 --> 01:52:47.794
AND SO WHAT WE WILL NEED TO DO

01:52:47.861 --> 01:52:49.229
IS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE A

01:52:49.295 --> 01:52:51.264
COMPREHENSIVE BASE OF

01:52:51.331 --> 01:52:52.699
INFORMATION THAT SAYS WHICH

01:52:52.765 --> 01:52:55.301
CAMPUSES HAVE AND WHICH HAVE NOT.

01:52:55.368 --> 01:52:57.437
TAKEN OF THIS PARTICULAR ITEM

01:52:57.504 --> 01:52:59.005
AND THAT IF YOU'RE ASKING THAT

01:52:59.072 --> 01:53:00.773
WE CAN PROVIDE INFORMATION THERE

01:53:00.840 --> 01:53:01.708
AND WHICH HAVE AND WHICH HAVE

01:53:01.774 --> 01:53:04.110
NOT WE CAN CERTAINLY HAVE THAT

01:53:04.177 --> 01:53:06.746
BY THE END OF THE CALENDAR RIGHT

01:53:06.813 --> 01:53:09.115
IN IT NO NO ADD INFORMATION IS

01:53:09.182 --> 01:53:10.717
GREAT.

01:53:10.783 --> 01:53:12.252
A BUT WHAT I WANNA KNOW ALL YOU

01:53:12.318 --> 01:53:13.520
HEAR ABOUT'S LEADERSHIP.

01:53:13.586 --> 01:53:16.389
SO WILL THE CHANCELLOR SO I JUST

01:53:16.456 --> 01:53:17.891
HEARD YOU KNOW THE THE STATEWIDE

01:53:17.957 --> 01:53:20.026
SENATE WILL TAKE SOMETHING UP

01:53:20.093 --> 01:53:21.494
BUT SAYS HE DOESN'T HAVE THE

01:53:21.561 --> 01:53:22.462
AUTHORITY TO ALTHOUGH I HOPE THE

01:53:22.529 --> 01:53:24.464
STATEWIDE SENATE WOULD CALL IN

01:53:24.531 --> 01:53:25.732
EACH OF THE CAMPUS'S TO DO THIS --

01:53:25.798 --> 01:53:26.399
I WOULD ALSO HOPE THE CHANCELLOR

01:53:26.466 --> 01:53:28.468
WOULD COMMIT TO CALLING ON EACH

01:53:28.535 --> 01:53:30.336
FACULTY SENATE EACH CAMPUS. TO

01:53:30.403 --> 01:53:32.972
TAKE UP TO DISCUSS AND MAKE A

01:53:33.039 --> 01:53:35.575
DECISION WHETHER THEY SUPPORT OR

01:53:35.642 --> 01:53:36.676
OPPOSE.

01:53:36.743 --> 01:53:37.644
LET'S PUT HIM ON THE RECORD.

01:53:37.710 --> 01:53:39.579
THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THIS

01:53:39.646 --> 01:53:41.447
REPORT THAT CAME OUT THREE YEARS

01:53:41.514 --> 01:53:50.056
AGO THAT WAS DONE I UNDERSTAND

01:53:50.123 --> 01:53:51.524
IT THE CHANCES BEHEST RIGHT.

01:53:51.591 --> 01:53:54.627
AND AND AND AND SO THAT WE I'D

01:53:54.694 --> 01:53:55.161
LIKE TO HEAR BACK FROM THE

01:53:55.228 --> 01:53:55.562
FACULTY SENATE.

01:53:55.628 --> 01:53:57.230
ARE DO THEY AGREE WITH THE IDEA

01:53:57.297 --> 01:53:58.298
OF FOOT THIS GOAL OF THIS BILL

01:53:58.364 --> 01:53:59.165
COST FOR AS WELL AS THE REST THE

01:53:59.232 --> 01:54:00.200
REPORT ARE WE GOING TO HIT YOU

01:54:00.266 --> 01:54:03.436
KNOW RECOMMEND -- ETHNIC STUDIES

01:54:03.503 --> 01:54:04.437
IS THERE A GRADUATION CLIMATE AS

01:54:04.504 --> 01:54:05.939
RECOMMENDED BY THIS TASK FORCE

01:54:06.005 --> 01:54:07.307
SO IT BECAUSE RIGHT NOW WHAT

01:54:07.373 --> 01:54:08.141
HAPPENS IS THAT IF THE SAYS THAT

01:54:08.208 --> 01:54:10.043
THEY DON'T ACT.

01:54:10.109 --> 01:54:10.577
YOU'RE PUTTING US IN A BAD

01:54:10.643 --> 01:54:11.744
POSITION BECAUSE I AGREE WITH

01:54:11.811 --> 01:54:12.712
YOU I DON'T WANNA HAVE TO TELL

01:54:12.779 --> 01:54:14.113
THE FACT THE SENATE WHAT TO DO

01:54:14.180 --> 01:54:15.014
BUT THE FACT WE SENATE'S NOT

01:54:15.081 --> 01:54:16.249
EVEN GOING TO ACT THAT PUTS US

01:54:16.316 --> 01:54:17.650
IN A VERY AWKWARD POSITION WE'VE

01:54:17.717 --> 01:54:18.918
HEARD A LOT OF POWERFUL

01:54:18.985 --> 01:54:20.286
TESTIMONY ABOUT.

01:54:20.353 --> 01:54:21.354
HOW IMPORTANT ETHNIC STUDIES IS

01:54:21.421 --> 01:54:23.289
A VALUABLE IS NOT ONLY FROM THE

01:54:23.356 --> 01:54:24.924
PROPONENTS BUT FROM YOURSELVES

01:54:24.991 --> 01:54:26.059
AND SO I THINK THIS WOULD BE A

01:54:26.125 --> 01:54:28.394
MATTER OF -- TOP IMPORTANCE

01:54:28.461 --> 01:54:31.931
GIVEN THE IMPACT OF ETHNIC

01:54:31.998 --> 01:54:35.635
STUDIES TO THE FACULTY SENATE.

01:54:35.702 --> 01:54:37.770
AND CHANCELLOR BY THE WAY SO

01:54:37.837 --> 01:54:40.506
WHERE'S THE CHANCELLOR ON THIS.

01:54:40.573 --> 01:54:42.508
WELL THE THE THE CHANCELLOR HAS

01:54:42.575 --> 01:54:45.278
BEEN VERY RESPONSIVE IN TERMS OF

01:54:45.345 --> 01:54:46.713
IN TERMS OF MAKING SURE THAT THE

01:54:46.779 --> 01:54:49.249
CAMPUSES.

01:54:49.315 --> 01:54:49.949
UNDERSTAND THEIR RESEARCH.

01:54:50.016 --> 01:54:51.551
I I'D LIKE TO SEE A LITTLE MORE

01:54:51.618 --> 01:54:53.353
LEADERSHIP IN THAT REGARD WEBER

01:54:53.419 --> 01:54:56.256
CALLING ON THE FACULTY SENATE TO

01:54:56.322 --> 01:54:57.824
IT EITHER TO EACH OF THE

01:54:57.890 --> 01:54:59.259
ACTUALLY SENATE'S AND THE

01:54:59.325 --> 01:54:59.792
PRESIDENTS OF EACH.

01:54:59.859 --> 01:55:00.893
TO BE SURE THAT THEY ACTUALLY

01:55:00.960 --> 01:55:02.462
TAKE THIS UP THE GEN DIS TO HAVE

01:55:02.528 --> 01:55:04.430
A DISCUSSION TO MAKE A DECISION

01:55:04.497 --> 01:55:06.132
BEFORE THE END OF THE YEAR.

01:55:06.199 --> 01:55:08.368
SO THAT HOPEFULLY THE SYSTEM

01:55:08.434 --> 01:55:10.370
COULD MOVE FORWARD I MEAN IF IF

01:55:10.436 --> 01:55:11.237
EVERYTHING COMES A SAYS WELL

01:55:11.304 --> 01:55:12.839
THESE ARE ALL THE REASONS.

01:55:12.905 --> 01:55:13.539
WE DON'T THINK THIS IS A GOOD

01:55:13.606 --> 01:55:14.974
IDEA OF THIS PUT THAT ON THE

01:55:15.041 --> 01:55:16.142
RECORD AND LET'S HAVE A

01:55:16.209 --> 01:55:17.410
DISCUSSION ABOUT THAT MAYBE

01:55:17.477 --> 01:55:18.411
THERE'S SOMETHING WE CAN DO TO

01:55:18.478 --> 01:55:19.912
MELIORATE THOSE ISSUES BUT WE

01:55:19.979 --> 01:55:21.114
CERTAINLY HEARD A LOT OF

01:55:21.180 --> 01:55:22.482
POWERFUL TESTIMONY NAY HER TO

01:55:22.548 --> 01:55:23.916
YOU DON'T DISAGREE WITH THAT.

01:55:23.983 --> 01:55:25.585
ABOUT THE VALUE OF ETHNIC

01:55:25.652 --> 01:55:30.390
STUDIES AND SO I'D LIKE THE

01:55:30.456 --> 01:55:31.924
FACULTY TO TAKE THE LEAD.

01:55:31.991 --> 01:55:34.127
RIGHT I'D LIKE TO FACULTY TAKE

01:55:34.193 --> 01:55:34.794
THE LEAD INSTEAD OF US HAVING TO

01:55:34.861 --> 01:55:36.429
DO IT.

01:55:36.496 --> 01:55:37.230
I MEAN I AGREE WITH YOU I DEBTS

01:55:37.297 --> 01:55:38.564
THIS IS THIS IS PROBABLY NOT A

01:55:38.631 --> 01:55:40.133
GOOD IDEA THAT WERE TRYING YOU

01:55:40.199 --> 01:55:42.035
KNOW THAT FOR THE FIRST TIME WE

01:55:42.101 --> 01:55:43.670
WERE GONNA POST SO I THEM AND I

01:55:43.736 --> 01:55:44.504
TALKED.

01:55:44.570 --> 01:55:45.438
TO SEVERAL WEBER AND EXPRESSED

01:55:45.505 --> 01:55:47.307
HIS CONCERNS AS WELL BUT I ALSO

01:55:47.373 --> 01:55:48.141
SUBMIT THAT I HEAR HER

01:55:48.207 --> 01:55:49.375
FRUSTRATION I HEAR THE

01:55:49.442 --> 01:55:52.011
FRUSTRATION OF MANY OF THE

01:55:52.078 --> 01:55:52.645
PEOPLE OF TESTIFIED FOR THE BILL

01:55:52.712 --> 01:55:53.479
THAT.

01:55:53.546 --> 01:55:55.682
WHAT'S TAKING SO LONG AND YOU

01:55:55.748 --> 01:55:56.849
KNOW IF AND IF THERE'S A REASON

01:55:56.916 --> 01:55:57.984
THE FACT THE SENATE OPPOSES.

01:55:58.051 --> 01:55:59.786
LET'S UNDERSTAND THAT WHAT'S THE

01:55:59.852 --> 01:56:01.154
REASON FOR THE OPPOSITION WHAT

01:56:01.220 --> 01:56:01.754
IS THERE SOMETHING WE COULD DO

01:56:01.821 --> 01:56:03.122
THE MILLER IT SO WE CAN SOLVE

01:56:03.189 --> 01:56:04.691
THE PROBLEM.

01:56:04.757 --> 01:56:08.127
INSTEAD OF WAITING AROUND THIS

01:56:08.194 --> 01:56:09.028
IT WILL BE HEARD FIFTY YEARS

01:56:09.095 --> 01:56:09.696
THIS REPORT CAME OUT THREE YEARS

01:56:09.762 --> 01:56:14.300
AGO.

01:56:14.367 --> 01:56:17.337
CAN CAN WE HAVE SOMETHING DONE.

01:56:17.403 --> 01:56:20.073

SURE THAT THE CHANCELLOR HAS A

01:56:24.143 --> 01:56:25.511
CONVERSATION WITH EACH OF THE

01:56:25.578 --> 01:56:26.512
PRESIDENT'S.

01:56:26.579 --> 01:56:28.514
AS A PART OF THE EVALUATION

01:56:28.581 --> 01:56:29.882
PROCESS THAT I JUST TALKED ABOUT.

01:56:29.949 --> 01:56:31.684
DETERMINE WHICH ONES HAVE

01:56:31.751 --> 01:56:34.087
ALREADY TAKEN THIS UP AS AN

01:56:34.153 --> 01:56:36.689
ISSUE IN HALF THAT AND THEN ASKS

01:56:36.756 --> 01:56:38.524
THE PRESIDENT'S TO ENSURE THAT

01:56:38.591 --> 01:56:39.792
THEY'RE WORKING IN COLLABORATION

01:56:39.859 --> 01:56:42.328
WITH THEIR SENATE'S. TO GET

01:56:42.395 --> 01:56:44.931

RECOMMENDATIONS.

01:56:51.437 --> 01:56:53.005

01:56:53.072 --> 01:56:55.408
GET OUT.

01:56:55.475 --> 01:56:56.642
I MEAN THIS IS NOT JUST ABOUT

01:56:56.709 --> 01:56:57.910
INFORMATION IS ABOUT LEADERSHIP

01:56:57.977 --> 01:56:58.544
RIGHT.

01:56:58.611 --> 01:57:00.179
BUT STE CONFRONT THE ISSUE AND

01:57:00.246 --> 01:57:02.482
DEAL WITH IT NOT JUST SAY WELL

01:57:02.548 --> 01:57:03.282

A DINNER STANDARD.

01:57:11.391 --> 01:57:13.092
OLD BUT WE HAVE BEFORE US A

01:57:13.159 --> 01:57:14.227
RECOMMENDATION WE HAVE BEFORE US

01:57:14.293 --> 01:57:16.262
A BILL THAT BASICALLY SUPPORTS A

01:57:16.329 --> 01:57:20.733
RECOMMENDATION THAT CAME FROM

01:57:20.800 --> 01:57:22.268
CSU SYSTEM ITSELF.

01:57:22.335 --> 01:57:22.869
THE TASK FOR THE CSU SYSTEM

01:57:22.935 --> 01:57:23.903
ITSELF.

01:57:23.970 --> 01:57:24.637
RIGHT SO IN THAT SENSE WHAT

01:57:24.704 --> 01:57:25.271
HAPPENS IS THAT.

01:57:25.338 --> 01:57:27.206
YEAH I DON'T LIKE THE IDEA OF US

01:57:27.273 --> 01:57:28.574
IMPOSING THOSE REQUIREMENTS.

01:57:28.641 --> 01:57:31.511
AT THE SAME TIME.

YOU KNOW THAT'S NOT ENTIRELY

01:57:47.927 --> 01:57:49.595

AND IF THEY DON'T AGREE WITH

01:58:05.478 --> 01:58:08.181
THAT THEN EXPLAIN WHY NOT AND

01:58:08.247 --> 01:58:10.616

BEFORE THE END OF THE YEAR

01:58:55.595 --> 01:58:57.029
SESSION AND I HOPE THAT YOU

01:58:59.065 --> 01:59:01.901
DON'T HAVE TO LEGISLATE.

01:59:01.968 --> 01:59:05.438
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

01:59:05.505 --> 01:59:06.806

ALL RIGHT AND ANY.

01:59:15.982 --> 01:59:18.718
AT THE TIPS THAT YOU KNOW -- I

01:59:18.784 --> 01:59:20.086
DON'T KNOW IF THEY'RE ANY OF THE

01:59:20.152 --> 01:59:22.221
QUESTIONS -- I'LL JUST LET ME

01:59:22.288 --> 01:59:24.056
SAY THAT -- THIS ISSUE OBVIOUSLY

01:59:24.123 --> 01:59:26.125
HAS BEEN CIRCULATING AROUND FOR

01:59:26.192 --> 01:59:28.895
A NUMBER OF YEARS AND IT SHOULD

01:59:28.961 --> 01:59:30.363
BE APPARENT TO THIS BODY.

01:59:30.429 --> 01:59:31.597
BUT THAT BODY IS NOT GOING TO

01:59:31.664 --> 01:59:32.932
ACT IN THE WAY THAT WE THINK

01:59:32.999 --> 01:59:34.567
IT'S APPROPRIATE.

01:59:34.634 --> 01:59:36.736
I MEAN -- AS I SAID YOU KNOW

01:59:36.802 --> 01:59:38.137
I'VE BEEN AT THE UNIVERSITY FOR

01:59:38.204 --> 01:59:39.672
FEEL LIKE FOR EVER.

01:59:39.739 --> 01:59:41.374
AND I'VE SERVED ON ALL OF THE

01:59:41.440 --> 01:59:43.843
COMMITTEES THAT THEY TALK ABOUT --

01:59:43.910 --> 01:59:46.512
AND I KNOW THAT THEY HAVE OFTEN

01:59:46.579 --> 01:59:48.214
BEEN MANDATE FROM OUTSIDE.

01:59:48.281 --> 01:59:50.283
THAT HAVE IMPACTED THE CAMPUS.

01:59:50.349 --> 01:59:51.717
I REMEMBER WHAT ROTC CAME SAN

01:59:51.784 --> 01:59:53.719
DIEGO STATE.

01:59:53.786 --> 01:59:55.087
THE FACULTY DID NOT WANT IT.

01:59:55.154 --> 01:59:56.756
BACK THE SAME ACADEMIC SENATE

01:59:56.822 --> 01:59:58.190
ACTUALLY VOTED AGAINST.

01:59:58.257 --> 01:59:59.525
BUT IT WAS ADMINISTRATION AND

01:59:59.592 --> 02:00:00.860
THE POWERS ABOVE THAT

02:00:00.927 --> 02:00:02.161
IMPLEMENTED ROTC IT'S AN ABLE

02:00:02.228 --> 02:00:03.729
STATE.

02:00:03.796 --> 02:00:05.431
DESPITE ALL OF THOSE QUESTIONS

02:00:05.498 --> 02:00:07.099
ABOUT OUR RIGHT TO CONTROL

02:00:07.166 --> 02:00:08.367
CURRICULUM AND TO DECIDE WHAT

02:00:08.434 --> 02:00:09.402
WE'RE GOING TO DO THERE ARE

02:00:09.468 --> 02:00:10.803
OTHER THINGS THAT HAPPEN AT THIS

02:00:10.870 --> 02:00:12.138
INSTITUTION.

02:00:12.204 --> 02:00:13.973
THAT DOT THAT BASICALLY OF DO

02:00:14.040 --> 02:00:16.275
NOT FOLLOW THIS REALLY PRISTINE

02:00:16.342 --> 02:00:18.644
ANALYSIS OF A FACULTY ENGAGEMENT

02:00:18.711 --> 02:00:20.379
AND SO FORTH AND SO ON AND I

02:00:20.446 --> 02:00:21.647
GUESS THE PROBLEM IS I'VE BEEN

02:00:21.714 --> 02:00:22.848
BEHIND THE CURTAIN AND I KNOW

02:00:22.915 --> 02:00:24.150
WHAT'S BEHIND THE CURTAIN.

02:00:24.216 --> 02:00:25.518
SO I'M NOT IMPRESSED WHEN PEOPLE

02:00:25.585 --> 02:00:27.119
TELL ME ABOUT THE IVORY TOWER

02:00:27.186 --> 02:00:29.388
TELL ME ABOUT ACADEMIC FREEDOM

02:00:29.455 --> 02:00:31.324
DIALOGUE IS THE SENATE

02:00:31.390 --> 02:00:32.558
COMMITTEES THE DADA DADA DOT.

02:00:32.625 --> 02:00:34.327
I KNOW THAT'S ALL A WAY OF

02:00:34.393 --> 02:00:35.795
SAYING IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN

02:00:35.861 --> 02:00:36.963
WHEN YOU LOOK AT ETHNIC STUDIES

02:00:37.029 --> 02:00:38.197
ETHNIC STUDIES CAME INTO

02:00:38.264 --> 02:00:39.332
EXISTENCE NOT BECAUSE PEOPLE

02:00:39.398 --> 02:00:40.533
THOUGHT IT WAS A GOOD ACADEMIC

02:00:40.600 --> 02:00:41.734
IDEA.

02:00:41.801 --> 02:00:43.069
NOT BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT IT WAS

02:00:43.135 --> 02:00:45.338
TIME BUT IT WAS FAIR IS BECAUSE

02:00:45.404 --> 02:00:46.539
STUDENTS WERE BURNING BUILDINGS

02:00:46.606 --> 02:00:48.708
AT IN THE CAMPUS I CAME TO SAN

02:00:48.774 --> 02:00:49.575
DIEGO STATE BECAUSE A BUNCH OF

02:00:49.642 --> 02:00:51.444
STUDENTS BURNED ALL THE TRASH

02:00:51.510 --> 02:00:52.178
CANS OF FROM THE PRESIDENT'S

02:00:52.244 --> 02:00:53.412
OFFICE.

02:00:53.479 --> 02:00:55.147
HE REALIZED ALL WE GOT TO HIRE

02:00:55.214 --> 02:00:56.882
SOME BLACK PEOPLE TO GET UP IN

02:00:56.949 --> 02:00:58.284
HERE THE STOP THE STUFF.

02:00:58.351 --> 02:01:00.486
AND THAT'S HOW I GOT HIRED AND

02:01:00.553 --> 02:01:01.654
THAT'S WHAT MOST LOS GOT HIRED

02:01:01.721 --> 02:01:03.289
SAN FRANCISCO STATE WAS A

02:01:03.356 --> 02:01:05.091
PROTEST FOR WELL OVER A YEAR.

02:01:05.157 --> 02:01:06.425
OKAY EVERY CAMPUS THAT YOU SEE

02:01:06.492 --> 02:01:07.393
WAS NOT SOME LITTLE ORDERLY

02:01:07.460 --> 02:01:09.261
PROCESS THAT OCCURRED STUDENTS

02:01:09.328 --> 02:01:10.563
SO OFTEN WERE DISPEL FROM

02:01:10.630 --> 02:01:12.298
CAMPUSES I HAVE FRIENDS WHO

02:01:12.365 --> 02:01:13.432
COULD NOT FINISH THEIR DEGREE

02:01:13.499 --> 02:01:14.333
CAL STATE LA.

02:01:14.400 --> 02:01:15.968
AND GUIDED MAYBE TWENTY YEARS

02:01:16.035 --> 02:01:17.737
LATER BECAUSE THEY WERE EXPELLED

02:01:17.803 --> 02:01:19.238
FROM THE CAMPUS FOR PROTESTING

02:01:19.305 --> 02:01:20.473
BUT ETHNIC STUDIES SO THIS IS

02:01:20.539 --> 02:01:22.074
NOT SOMETHING THAT IS GOING TO

02:01:22.141 --> 02:01:23.743
EASILY WALK THROUGH THE IVORY

02:01:23.809 --> 02:01:26.012
TOWER HOLES AND BE EMBRACED IT

02:01:26.078 --> 02:01:27.413
IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.

02:01:27.480 --> 02:01:29.181
THE A LOT OF POLITICS THAT OCCUR%

02:01:29.248 --> 02:01:29.782
WHEN YOU HAVE WHEN YOU START

02:01:29.849 --> 02:01:31.951
TALKING ABOUT REQUIRING A COURSE

02:01:32.018 --> 02:01:33.052
TO BE TAUGHT YOU HAVE BEEN

02:01:33.119 --> 02:01:34.453
CHANGING THE PERSPECTIVE NOT

02:01:34.520 --> 02:01:35.855
ONLY OF THE PUBLIC BUT OF THE

02:01:35.921 --> 02:01:37.056
FACULTY AS WELL.

02:01:37.123 --> 02:01:38.124
IN TERMS OF WHAT THEY SEE IS

02:01:38.190 --> 02:01:39.959
IMPORTANT WHAT THEY VALUE THAT'S

02:01:40.026 --> 02:01:41.427
GOING TO CHANGE IT'S ALSO GOING

02:01:41.494 --> 02:01:42.928
TO SOMETIMES CHANGE THE DYNAMICS

02:01:42.995 --> 02:01:44.530
OF POWER AT AN INSTITUTION.

02:01:44.597 --> 02:01:46.132
BECAUSE STUDENTS NOW WILL BE C.

02:01:46.198 --> 02:01:47.566
FACULTY WILL HAVE REQUIRED TO

02:01:47.633 --> 02:01:49.168
SEE PEOPLE WHO DON'T LOOK LIKE

02:01:49.235 --> 02:01:50.102
THEM WE CAN GIVE THEM

02:01:50.169 --> 02:01:51.837
INFORMATION THAT THEY DON'T HAVE.

02:01:51.904 --> 02:01:53.973
IT ALSO CHANGES THE DYNAMICS IN

02:01:54.040 --> 02:01:55.408
TERMS OF WHO'S FUNDED AND WHO'S

02:01:55.474 --> 02:01:56.642
NOT FUND IT SO LET'S BE REAL

02:01:56.709 --> 02:01:57.710
ABOUT IT THIS IS POWER

02:01:57.777 --> 02:01:59.745
DISCUSSION THIS IS ABOUT WHO

02:01:59.812 --> 02:02:00.846
WILL HAVE INFLUENCE.

02:02:00.913 --> 02:02:08.554
NOT ONLY AT THE INSTITUTION BUT

02:02:08.621 --> 02:02:11.223
WHO WILL HAVE INFLUENCE AND CAL

02:02:11.290 --> 02:02:13.192
ONE YEAR THE IVORY TOWER SOMEHOW

02:02:13.259 --> 02:02:14.560
ANOTHER STRONGHOLDS ITSELF INTO

02:02:14.627 --> 02:02:15.161
THIS IMPARTIAL -- PERSPECTIVE

02:02:15.227 --> 02:02:15.961
BUT THE REALITY IS IT IS VERY

02:02:16.028 --> 02:02:16.729
PARTIAL IT IS VERY CONCERNED

02:02:16.796 --> 02:02:17.863
ABOUT ECONOMICS IT IS VERY

02:02:17.930 --> 02:02:18.264
CONCERNED ABOUT.

02:02:18.330 --> 02:02:19.832
MAINTAINING THE STATUS QUO AND

02:02:19.899 --> 02:02:21.300
WE CAN YOU TO PARTICIPATE IN

02:02:21.367 --> 02:02:22.168
THAT OR WE CAN CHANGE IT.

02:02:22.234 --> 02:02:23.335
AND SO I YOU KNOW I'M NOT

02:02:23.402 --> 02:02:24.070
IMPRESSED AT ALL WITH THE

02:02:24.136 --> 02:02:24.837
CONVERSATION BECAUSE I KNOW

02:02:24.904 --> 02:02:25.771
WHAT'S GOING HAPPEN NEXT YEAR

02:02:25.838 --> 02:02:26.772
THE YEAR AFTER YEAR AFTER IT WE

02:02:26.839 --> 02:02:28.040
CONTINUE DOWN THIS PATH.

02:02:28.107 --> 02:02:29.508
AT SOME POINT EVERYTHING WE'VE

02:02:29.575 --> 02:02:31.444
EVER DONE HAS VIOLATED THE RULES

02:02:31.510 --> 02:02:33.045
IN ORDER TO GET IT DONE BROWN

02:02:33.112 --> 02:02:34.613
VERSUS BOARD OF EDUCATION TALKS

02:02:34.680 --> 02:02:35.881
ABOUT THE ARE WE GOING TO

02:02:35.948 --> 02:02:38.017
INTERVENE IN STATES WHERE THEY

02:02:38.084 --> 02:02:39.051
HAVE STATES RIGHTS TO DETERMINE

02:02:39.118 --> 02:02:40.453
WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN IN SCHOOLS.

02:02:40.519 --> 02:02:43.823
AND WE FINALLY SAID YES WE HAVE.

02:02:43.889 --> 02:02:45.057
TO AND WHEN WE BEGIN TO LOOK AT

02:02:45.124 --> 02:02:46.459
ALL THE CHANGES THAT HAVE

02:02:46.525 --> 02:02:48.060
OCCURRED IN THIS NATION THEY

02:02:48.127 --> 02:02:48.894
HAVE ATTAINED THEY'VE A CARD

02:02:48.961 --> 02:02:50.296
BECAUE PEOPLE DECIDED.

02:02:50.362 --> 02:02:53.132
ENOUGH IS ENOUGH WE HAVE TO MOVE

02:02:53.199 --> 02:02:54.567
FOR THIS IS WHAT WE BELIEVE IN

02:02:54.633 --> 02:02:56.102
AND WE HAVE TO CHANGE THE RULES

02:02:56.168 --> 02:02:57.169
OF ENGAGEMENT.

02:02:57.236 --> 02:02:58.070
AND SO WHEN I LOOK AT THE

02:02:58.137 --> 02:03:00.306
ACADEMIC SENATE HAVING SPENT ALL

02:03:00.372 --> 02:03:02.374
OF MY LIFE AT THE C. ISSUE.

02:03:02.441 --> 02:03:03.409
ALL OF MY ACADEMIC LIFE THERE

02:03:03.476 --> 02:03:04.977
AND WORKING TO CHANGE THE WHAT

02:03:05.044 --> 02:03:07.012
IS HAPPENING I UNDERSTAND THE

02:03:07.079 --> 02:03:08.214
LANGUAGE I UNDERSTAND THE BOOKS

02:03:08.280 --> 02:03:10.316
IN THE HOWEVER BECAUSE MAYBE SO

02:03:10.382 --> 02:03:11.984
FORTH AND SO ON ALL THE

02:03:12.051 --> 02:03:12.952
RESTRICTIONS THAT ARE OFTEN PUT

02:03:13.018 --> 02:03:14.453
UP. TO SIMPLY SAY WE'RE NOT

02:03:14.520 --> 02:03:15.521
GOING TO DO THIS BECAUSE WE'RE

02:03:15.588 --> 02:03:17.323
NOT GOING TO EMPOWER STUDENTS TO

02:03:17.389 --> 02:03:18.991
HAVE THE INFORMATION THEY NEED

02:03:19.058 --> 02:03:20.559
TO BE THE KIND OF CITIZENS THAT

02:03:20.626 --> 02:03:21.327
WE WANT.

02:03:21.393 --> 02:03:23.095
WE COMPLAIN ABOUT ALL THE HATRED

02:03:23.162 --> 02:03:25.331
IN CALIFORNIA WE COMPLAIN ABOUT

02:03:25.397 --> 02:03:26.699
THE LACK OF INFORMATION PEOPLE

02:03:26.766 --> 02:03:28.267
HAVE WE COMPLAIN ABOUT STUDENTS

02:03:28.334 --> 02:03:29.602
NOT BEING CHALLENGED TO THINK

02:03:29.668 --> 02:03:30.970
DIFFERENTLY AND TO FORM A

02:03:31.036 --> 02:03:32.238
CALIFORNIA THAT IS VERY VERY

02:03:32.304 --> 02:03:33.038
DIFFERENT.

02:03:33.105 --> 02:03:35.040
I SEE WHAT HAPPENS TO WHITE

02:03:35.107 --> 02:03:36.342
STUDENTS WHO TAKE ETHNIC STUDIES

02:03:36.408 --> 02:03:38.611
THEIR LIVES ARE CHANGED FOREVER

02:03:38.677 --> 02:03:40.045
THE PERSPECTIVES ARE CHANGED FOR

02:03:40.112 --> 02:03:42.681
EVER AND AND SO WE HAVE TO LOOK

02:03:42.748 --> 02:03:43.249
AT THIS NOT JUST AS A BLACK

02:03:43.315 --> 02:03:43.849
BROWN THING.

02:03:43.916 --> 02:03:45.117
BUT WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THIS AS

02:03:45.184 --> 02:03:47.520
RESCUE IN CALIFORNIA IF WE'RE

02:03:47.586 --> 02:03:48.921
EVER GOING TO TALK ABOUT ETHNIC

02:03:48.988 --> 02:03:50.523
STUDIES IN K. TWELVE IT IS

02:03:50.589 --> 02:03:52.158
BECAUSE WE HAVE EDUCATED THE

02:03:52.224 --> 02:03:53.793
TEACHER TEACHERS IN THE C. ISSUE

02:03:53.859 --> 02:03:54.794
TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT. TO BE

02:03:54.860 --> 02:03:56.996
ABLE TO CHANGE THE COMMON

02:03:57.062 --> 02:03:57.830
NARRATIVE THAT'S THERE AND TO

02:03:57.897 --> 02:03:59.231
PRESENT THE INFORMATION THAT'S

02:03:59.298 --> 02:03:59.732
ALWAYS CENTRAL.

02:03:59.799 --> 02:04:01.400
THIS IS CRITICAL FOR CALIFORNIA

02:04:01.467 --> 02:04:07.006
BEING THE DIVERSE STATE IT WANTS

02:04:07.072 --> 02:04:08.407
TO BE HAVE THE INFORMATION TO

02:04:08.474 --> 02:04:09.542
MAKE THE DIFFERENCE IN THE LIVES

02:04:09.608 --> 02:04:10.810
OF OUR YOUNG PEOPLE BUT IN THE

02:04:10.876 --> 02:04:11.243
LIVES OF ALL OF US.

02:04:11.310 --> 02:04:12.745
AND IT'S ONLY FOR THAT REASON

02:04:12.812 --> 02:04:13.612
THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AND

02:04:13.679 --> 02:04:14.146
I BOTH DID YOU TO HAVE THE

02:04:14.213 --> 02:04:14.880
COURAGE TO JOIN ME AND NOT

02:04:14.947 --> 02:04:16.882
LISTEN TO THE NARRATIVE THAT I

02:04:16.949 --> 02:04:18.050
HAVE LISTEN TO FOR FIFTY YEARS.

02:04:18.117 --> 02:04:19.185
ALL IN TERMS OF WHAT THE

02:04:19.251 --> 02:04:20.586
UNIVERSITY CAN AND CANNOT DO

02:04:20.653 --> 02:04:22.054
BECAUSE I KNOW THEY DO WHAT THEY

02:04:22.121 --> 02:04:24.056
WANT TO DO WHEN THEY WANT TO DO

02:04:24.123 --> 02:04:25.758
IT REGARDLESS OF WHO WAS IN

02:04:25.825 --> 02:04:26.859
CHARGE.

02:04:26.926 --> 02:04:29.094
WHO HAS A ROLE TO DO IT WHO HAS

02:04:29.161 --> 02:04:30.663
THE RIGHT TO DO IT ALL THOSE

02:04:30.729 --> 02:04:32.198
KINDS OF THINGS?

02:04:32.264 --> 02:04:33.799
I HAVE BEEN A PART OF THAT FOR

02:04:33.866 --> 02:04:35.734
EVER I KNOW THE NARRATIVE I KNOW

02:04:35.801 --> 02:04:36.869
THE LANGUAGE AND THANK GOD I'M

02:04:36.936 --> 02:04:39.772
HERE TO TELL YOU THAT IT'S ALL.

02:04:39.839 --> 02:04:41.473
UNFAIR UNFOUNDED AND IF I

02:04:41.540 --> 02:04:42.741
BELIEVE IN THE EASTER BUNNY THEN

02:04:42.808 --> 02:04:44.243
I WOULD BELIEVE IN THAT SO ONCE

02:04:44.310 --> 02:04:45.845
AGAIN I ASK FOR YOU TO VOTE FOR

02:04:45.911 --> 02:04:48.480
THIS BILL FOR AB FOURTEEN SIXTY

02:04:48.547 --> 02:04:50.382
FOR US TO DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT.

02:04:50.449 --> 02:04:54.453
AND THE CHALLENGES SYSTEM AS IT

02:04:54.520 --> 02:04:56.488
SHOULD BE.

THANK YOU DOCTOR WEBER -- OKAY.

02:05:02.895 --> 02:05:03.596

02:05:05.664 --> 02:05:06.632

02:05:06.699 --> 02:05:08.801
OPINION ON THE BILL -- AND I DO

02:05:08.868 --> 02:05:10.402

02:05:15.474 --> 02:05:17.343
SOMETHING THAT THE ACADEMIC

02:05:17.409 --> 02:05:19.011

02:05:19.078 --> 02:05:20.479
EXIT WITH THE TASK FORCE HAS

02:05:20.546 --> 02:05:21.547

IT'S NEVER HAPPENED.

02:05:30.522 --> 02:05:31.857
AND I WOULD JUST SAY THAT NEVER

02:05:31.924 --> 02:05:33.392
NEVER HAPPENS UNTIL IT DOES

02:05:33.459 --> 02:05:36.929
