AGAIN IT'S AB TWENTY FIVE FORTY ONE FILE ITEM NUMBER ONE. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS. GOOD AFTERNOON. I WOULD LIKE TO FIRST THANK THE COMMITTEE CONSULTANT TANYA LIEBERMAN FOR WORKING HARD WITH MY STAFF AND THE SPONSORS ON THIS BILL LIKE SEPT THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY FIVE FORTY ONE WOULD FUND AND ENSURE MUCH NEEDED EARLY INTENSIVE LANGUAGE SERVICES FOR DEAF AND HARD OF HEARING CHILDREN OF AGES ZERO THROUGH FIVE. AS AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL TEACHER FOR OVER THIRTY YEARS I KNOW HOW VITAL THE FIRST FIVE YEARS OF A CHILD'S LIFE IS NOT ONLY IN THEIR PHYSICAL MENTAL EMOTIONAL AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT BUT ALSO IN LANGUAGE ACQUISITION. THIS IS WHY RESOURCES AND SERVICES NEED TO BE PROVIDED AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE AND A CHILD'S LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENT. CALIFORNIA HAS COMPREHENSIVE AND COORDINATED SYSTEM THROUGH THE STATE'S NEWBORN HEARING SCREENING PROGRAM WHICH INFANTS. BEFORE THEY LEAVE THE HOSPITAL. GO THROUGH THIS ALLOWS US TO IDENTIFY THE TWO OUT OF TWO TO THREE OUT OF EVERY THOUSAND INFANTS WHO ARE BORN DEAF OR HARD OF HEARING THIS POWERFUL TO OVERLY DETECTION ALLOWS THE FAMILY AND THEIR LOCAL OR EARLY INTERVENTION PROVIDER TO DEVELOP AN INDIVIDUALIZED FAMILY SERVICE PLAN IN ORDER TO PROVIDE SERVICES AT THE EARLIEST AGE. LANGUAGE ACQUISITION FOR DEAF AND HARD OF HEARING CHILDREN REQUIRE FULL ACCESS AND EXPOSURE TO LANGUAGE STARTING AT BIRTH AND CONTINUING THROUGH AGE FIVE IN ONE OR BOTH LANGUAGES AMERICAN SIGN LANGUAGE AND ENGLISH. AB TWENTY FIVE FORTY FOUR ONE REQUIRES FUNDING TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS FOR CONTRACTING WITH CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS FOR THE DEAF OR NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED. TO NOT NON PUBLIC NON SECTARIAN SCHOOLS OR AGENCIES FOR PURPOSE OF PROVIDING SPECIALIZED SERVICES TO CHILDREN AGAIN FROM BIRTH TO FIVE. HAVING A STRONG LAO LANGUAGE FOUNDATION WILL EMPOWER DEAF AND HARD OF HEARING CHILDREN'S TO SUCCEED AND KINDERGARTEN AND THROUGHOUT THEIR ACADEMIC YEARS WITH ME TODAY TO PROVIDE TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT AND ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS OUR MISSIONARY FARINA CHAIR OF THE CALIFORNIA COLLEGIATE COALITION OF AGENCIES SERVING THE DEAF AND HARD OF HEARING. AND THE SPONSORS OF AB TWENTY FIVE FORTY ONE AND MISS JULIE RAMS THE MORROW SO MARIO BOARD A MEMBER OF THE CALIFORNIA EDUCATORS OF THE DEAF AND SITS ON THE CAL ADDS LEGISLATIVE. AFFAIRS COMMITTEE. WITH THAT YOUR FIRST WITNESS. GOOD AFTERNOON I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THE MY GUESS ON IF YOU CAN HEAR MY INTERPRETER. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR. I AM SHERRY FARINA I IN THE CHAIR OF THE CALIFORNIA COALITION OF AGENCIES SERVING THE DEAF AND HARD OF HEARING. I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF A COLLECTIVE GROUP OF A LONG LIST OF STAKEHOLDERS WHO ARE AND SPONSOR OF THIS BILL- WE REPRESENT. THE AND I REPRESENT THE FULL REPRESENTATION OF DEAF AND HARD OF HEARING- CHILDREN. IN CALIFORNIA. WE ALL OF US HAVE WORKED TOGETHER FOR THE PAST TEN YEARS ESPECIALLY INCLUDING THE PASSAGE OF SB TWO TEN. THAT WAS IN CHAPTER TWENTY FIFTEEN AND IT BROUGHT THE STATE'S FOCUS ON ACCESS TO LANGUAGE FOR CHILDREN WHO ARE DEAF AND HARD OF HEARING AGES ZERO TO FIVE. THIS BILL AB TWENTY FIVE FORTY ONE. WE'LL KEEP THE STATE'S FOCUS ON IT AND THE ONLY PROVEN FACT THAT CHILDREN WHO ARE DEAF AND HARD OF HEARING TO BE READY TO LEARN THEY ABSOLUTELY MUST HAVE ACCESS TO LEARNING LANGUAGE. BECAUSE OF LANGUAGE DEPRIVATION EPIDEMIC DEAF CHILDREN MAY ARRIVE TO PUBLIC SCHOOLS WITH ZERO LANGUAGE OFTENTIMES. DURING THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS WILL CONTACT OUR AGENCIES REQUESTING HELP AND SUPPORT FOR SERVICES SUCH AS DEAF COACHING WORKING WITH FAMILIES AND THEIR INFANTS AND CHILDREN. HOWEVER NOT ALL SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAVE THIS FUNDING TO DO THAT. AND ALSO WHEN A CHILD. IS TRANSITIONING FROM I. F. S. B. TO AN I EP. OFTEN TIMES SCHOOL DISTRICTS WILL SAY NO SORRY WE HAVE NO MONEY TO PROVIDE SERVICES SO THAT CHILD THEN OR ANY PROGRESS THAT CHILD HAD BENEFITTED FROM THE FIRST THREE YEARS IS NOW LOST UNTIL THEY ARRIVE TO CANNING GARDEN. AND THERE IS NOTHING NO COMMUNICATION. TO MOVE FORWARD IN THEIR ACADEMICS SO THE CHILD'S PROGRESS OBVIOUSLY. GOES DOWN. AB TWENTY FIVE FORTY ONE WELL CORRECT AN IMBALANCE OF THE EARLY LANGUAGE ACQUISITION AND PREPARES DEAF AND HARD OF HEARING CHILDREN TO BE READY TO LEARN WHEN THEY ARRIVE TO KIDDING GARDEN. THE BOTTOM LINE IS KEY LANGUAGE ACCESS. THAT IS THE BASIC HUMAN RIGHT. FOR DEAF AND HARD OF HEARING CHILDREN DESERVE MANY SERVICES AS POSSIBLE SO THAT THEY CAN BE CAUGHT UP IN REQUIRED LANGUAGE. SO THAT THEY ARE ABLE TO BE READY TO LEARN AND BE EDUCATED THERE ARE SCHOOL SYSTEMS SO WE ASK FOR YOUR STRONG SUPPORT TO AB TWENTY FOUR FIVE FORTY ONE. THANK YOU CHAIR AND MEMBERS. GOOD AFTERNOON I'M DR JULIE RAIMES THE MARIO I'M THE CHAIR FOR LEGISLATIVE CHAIRS FROM CAL AT WHICH IS THE CALIFORNIA EDUCATORS FOR THE DEATH IN CALIFORNIA. I ASKED YOU TO SUPPORT TWENTY FIVE FORTY ONE. TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL ESSENTIAL INTERVENTION SERVICES FOR OUR YOUNG DEAF AND HARD OF HEARING CHILDREN AGES ZERO TO FIVE TO ENSURE LANGUAGE ACQUISITION AND THEIR DEVELOPMENT. IT IS A VERY COMMON MISCONCEPTION THAT WHEN. THE DEAF CHILD WHO IS RECEIVING SERVICES IS FINE BUT THAT'S NOT TRUE THEY'RE NOT DOING FINE FINE IS SAID A DIRTY FOUR LETTER WORD THEY'RE NOT DOING OKAY WITHOUT LANGUAGE THERE IS NO BRAIN DEVELOPMENT THERE'S NO COMMUNICATION THERE'S NO OPPORTUNITIES TO LEARN. THERE ARE NO ABILITY TO SUCCEED. SO ALL THE STUDIES THAT WE HAVE HERE IN CALIFORNIA ALL THE DATA AT THE STATE. IT SHOWS THAT THE BRAIN IS NOT SIMPLY PICKING UP LANGUAGE AND COGNITIVE DEVELOPMENT. SPECIALIZE IN SERVICES NEEDS TO BE PROVIDED TO THE CHILD AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE FROM AGES ZERO TO FIVE OFTENTIMES SCHOOL DISTRICTS DO NOT TO PAY FOR THE NECESSARY CRITICAL LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENT DAHLE SERVICES. AND THIS IS A REFLECTIVE IN OUR STATE DATA REPORTS. ACCORDING TO THE L. A. REPORT STUDENTS OUTCOMES FOR THE PAST SEVERAL DECADES. SHOWS THAT DEVON HARD OF HEARING CHILDREN ARE THE VERY LOWEST PERFORMING GROUP. AB THEIR PROFICIENCY LEVEL IT'S NOT BECAUSE THEIR DEATH. IT IS BECAUSE THEY ARE MISSING THE CRITICAL WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY OF LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENT AND ACQUISITION THIS GAP IS HUGE AND IT HURTS THE DEAF AND HARD OF HEARING CHILDREN DEVELOPMENT IN ALL AREAS BY THE TIME THEY ARRIVED TO KENNY GARDEN. THEY'RE NOT READY TO LEARN. THEY STRUGGLE BECAUSE THEY WERE LANGUAGE DEPRIVED AS MENTIONED EARLIER FROM MISSOURI FARINA AND ACCORDING TO S. B. TWO TEN DATA DEAF AND HARD OF HEARING CHILDREN ARE FALLING BEHIND WITH THEIR EARLY LANGUAGE MILESTONES AT AGE THREE. AT AGE FIVE THEY ALREADY HAVE NOT BEEN READY TO READ AND WRITE WHEN THEY GET TO KINDERGARTEN. HOWEVER IT IS IMPORTANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT ALL THE DATA SHOWS THAT DEAF AND HARD OF HEARING CHILDREN WHO HAVE RECEIVED CONSISTENT AND PROPER SERVICES TO ACCESS LANGUAGE FROM ZERO TO FIVE ARE SUCCEEDING IN SCHOOL CALIFORNIA TEACHERS WHO WORK WITH DEAF AND HARD OF HEARING CHILDREN NEED MORE SUPPORT. FROM EXTERNAL LANGUAGE AND EDUCATION EXPERTS SO PLEASE SUPPORT AB TWENTY FIVE FORTY ONE THANK YOU. GREAT THANK YOU WELL AS I DO WE HAVE A- OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. HE'S COME FORWARD TO THE MICROPHONE STATE YOUR NAME AFFILIATION AND POSITION ON THE BILL ONLY PLEASE.

OF THE FUNKY JOSE MEDINA MR MEDINA COME FORWARD. FILE ITEM NUMBER TWO. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS TODAY I PRESENT A. B. SIXTEEN FIFTY TWO A BILL THAT CODIFIES THE RECENT ATTORNEY GENERAL'S LEGAL OPINION EMPLOYEE OF A CHARTER SCHOOL MAY NOT SERVE AS A MEMBER OF THE COUNTY BOARD OF EDUCATION IN THE COUNTY WHERE THEY'RE EMPLOYED SCHOOL IS LOCATED. EXISTING LAW PROHIBITS AN EMPLOYEE OF A SCHOOL DISTRICT FROM BEING ELECTED OR APPOINTED MEMBER OF THAT SCHOOL DISTRICT'S GOVERNING BOARD. UNLESS AND UNTIL THEY RESIGNED AS A EMPLOYEE. AB SIXTEEN FIFTY TWO WILL ALSO APPLY THAT SAME LIMITATION TO ANY EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR CHARTER SCHOOL EMPLOYEES CONSERVING ON THE CHARTER SCHOOLS AUTHORIZING SCHOOL DISTRICT'S GOVERNING BOARD. BUT PROVIDING A PROCESS FOR THE IMPACTED SITTING BOARD MEMBERS TO FINISH THEIR RESPECTIVE TERMS OF OFFICE THIS BILL IS A SIMPLE SOLUTION TO ENSURE FAIR AND DIVERSE REPRESENTATION. AB SIXTEEN FIFTY TWO WILL PREVENT ANY CONFLICTS OF INTEREST AND ESTABLISH EQUALITY BETWEEN CHARTER SCHOOL EMPLOYEES AND TRADITIONAL PUBLIC SCHOOL EMPLOYEES. IN SUPPORT OF AB SIXTEEN FIFTY TWO I HAVE A STATEMENT THAT I'D LIKE TO READ ON BEHALF OF CLEAR CRAWFORD SENIOR POLICY ADVISOR- IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST WHO IS NOT ABLE TO BE HERE THE DESCENT. THE TESTIFIED. SO THIS IS A STATEMENT FROM CLAIRE CRAWFORD OF IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST. WHICH IS CONDUCTED EXTENSIVE RESEARCH ON THE CHARTER SECTOR IN CALIFORNIA AND ITS IMPACT ON THE OVERALL PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM. THE GENERAL DIRECTION OF THE LEGISLATURE HAS BEEN TO RECOGNIZE THAT HAVE CHARTER SCHOOLS ARE PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND CHARTER SCHOOLS MUST OPERATE WITH THE SAME TRANSPARENCY FAIRNESS OPENNESS AND ACCOUNTABILITY. YET THIS SO FAR HAS NOT BEEN ENFORCED FOR CHARTER SCHOOL EMPLOYEES TWO RECENT EXAMPLES SHOW THE NEED TO CLARIFY PUBLIC INTEGRITY LOTS. A NEW CHARTER PETITION RECENTLY PROPOSED BY THE PACIFIC CHARTERED INSTITUTE CHANGE THE FOLSOM CORDOVA UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT WAS DENIED. LEAVING THE CHARTER SCHOOL WITH THE OPTION TO APPEAL THE DECISION THE SACRAMENTO COUNTY BOARD OF EDUCATION. YET THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE PACIFIC CHARTERED INSTITUTE SITS ON THE SACRAMENTO BOARD OF EDUCATION. SACRAMENTO SUPERINTENDENT ALSO EVALUATES THE MERITS OF THE CHARTER PETITION OF THE COUNTY BOARD. THE SECOND SITUATION IS THE CASE OF THE M. INSPIRED CHARTER SCHOOL CHAIN THAT. THE APPOINTED SAN DIEGO COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT JOINED SEVEN OTHER COUNTY SUPERINTENDENTS AND CALLING FOR AN AUDIT OF THE INS SPIRED CHARTER CHANGE. HAD THERE BEEN MEMBERS OF THE COUNTY BOARD AFFILIATED WITH THE INSPIRED CHARTER CHANGE THEY COULD HAVE HAD A SIGNET SIGNIFICANT CHILLING EFFECT ON THE APPOINTED THE TIME WHERE THE LEGISLATURE CONSIDERS AND ALLOWING- MEMBERS OF- TEACHERS OR EMPLOYEES OF PUBLIC SCHOOLS TO CHARTER SCHOOL EMPLOYEES IN PARTICULAR THEIR LEADERSHIP SHOULD BE COVERED N THE SAME MANNER AS ALL PUBLIC SCHOOL EMPLOYEES REGARDING PUBLIC INTEGRITY LOS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MR MEDINA YOU READ OFF ONE WITNESS STATEMENT DID YOU HAVE ANOTHER WITNESS I WAS AGED ONE WITNESS I THINK THIS IS THE ONLY WITNESS UNDERSTOOD THANK YOU DO WE HAVE ANY- WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL. ASCENA OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL. WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ANY COMMENTS OR ANY THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS MR MCCARTY BENNETT. SECOND BY MISTER LEE. YEAH I JUST WANT TO. THIS NOTE THAT MR MEDINA THIS IS I THINK AN APPROPRIATE BILL OF GOOD GOVERNMENT BILL AND YOU KNOW WE WENT THROUGH SOME CHARTER ISSUES A FEW YEARS AGO I THINK HAD SOME FAIR LEGISLATION AND A LED BY. THE CHAIR AND WE WERE ON THESE ON THESE BILLS THIS ISN'T THAT YOU KNOW OUR YOU KNOW RE HASHING THE CHARTER WARS THIS IS ABOUT CONFLICTS OF INTEREST AND ONE OF THE SIGNIFICANT BILLS THAT WE PASSED WAS FIFTEEN OH FIVE IT SAYS THAT THE BOARD SHOULD LOOK AT THE OVERALL. FISCAL HEALTH OF THE UNDERLYING SCHOOL DISTRICT THAT HE SAID SOMEBODY ON THE BOARD WHO HAS THAT ANOTHER AGENDA- THEY'RE NOT ABLE TO DO THEIR JOB. AND SO I THINK THIS IS PARAMOUNT THAT WE HAVE YOU KNOW MAKE SURE WE HAVE FAIRNESS AND TRANSPARENCY IN THIS IS A SPOT ON MEASURES OF THANK YOU. WELL SAID MR MCCARTY ANY OTHER. AMBER'S COMMITTEE WE STILL TIME WE DO HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND YOU MAY CLOSE RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL. AMENDMENTS ARE NOW. PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO THE ASSEMBLY FLOOR- DONALD HI DONALD I DALLI DALLI I'D THAT IT. SENATE I'D CHEN. CAN I LEAVE. LEAI MCCARTY MCCARTY AYE QUIRK-SILVA. THE BILL HAS EXPOSED ZERO IT IS OUT MISTER MEDINA THANK YOU SO GONNA FILE ITEM NUMBER THREE AB EIGHTEEN FIFTY THREE BY MR BERMAN THAT'S FILE ITEM NUMBER THREE YOU MAY COME FORWARD AND PROCEED WHEN READING. AND IF YOU HAVE WITNESSES THEY MAY COME FORWARD AS WELL. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS AND COLLEAGUES. FIRST OF ALL I THINK COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR WORK ON THIS BILL I'LL BE ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS DESCRIBING THE ANALYSIS. OUR SOCIETY HAS WITNESSED PROFOUND CHANGES IN THE WAYS WE LIVE AND WORK YOU TO ADVANCES IN COMPUTER. COMPUTER SCIENCE IS TRANSFORMING INDUSTRY BOLSTERING PRODUCTIVITY AND DRIVING JOB CREATION INNOVATION THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY. DESPITE GROWING RECOGNITION OF THE IMPORTANCE OF COMPUTER SCIENCE EDUCATION COMPUTER SCIENCE COURSES ARE ONLY TAUGHT IN 41% OF CALIFORNIA HIGH SCHOOLS WITH JUST THREE PERCENT. OF THE ONE POINT NINE MILLION HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS ENROLLED IN THESE CRITICAL COURSES. THE PRIMARY REASON SCHOOLS DON'T OFFER COMPUTER SCIENCE COURSES IS BECAUSE THERE ARE NOT ENOUGH TEACHERS TRAINED TO TEACH THOSE COURSES. AB EIGHTEEN FIFTY THREE WOULD TAKE AN IMPORTANT STEP IN ENSURING ALL STUDENTS CAN ACCESS COMPUTER SCIENCE. BOB BY PREPARING FUTURE TEACHERS TO TEACH COMPUTER SCIENCE IN K. THROUGH TWELVE SCHOOLS. SPECIFICALLY THIS BILL WOULD CREATE AN INCENTIVE GRANT PROGRAM FOR INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER EDUCATION TO DEVELOP OR EXPAND K. THROUGH TWELVE COMPUTER SCIENCE AND COMPUTATIONAL THINKING COURSE WORK. IN TEACHER PREPARATION PROGRAMS I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE ON A. B. EIGHTEEN FIFTY THREE- AND WITH ME TODAY ARE ALEXIS HERE AGAIN REPRESENTING CO DOT ORG THE BILL SPONSOR. AND LEE SAID NICK NICK. NICK NICK POCKET THE TALKING. ABOUT THE RIGHT. WITH TECHNET. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS MY NAME IS ALEXIS HERE AGAIN THE SENIOR DIRECTOR OF STATE GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS AT CO EXPANDING ACCESS TO COMPUTER SCIENCE IN SCHOOLS AND INCREASING PARTICIPATION BY YOUNG WOMEN AND STUDENTS FROM OTHER UNDERREPRESENTED GROUPS OUR VISION IS THAT EVERY STUDENT IN EVERY SCHOOL HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN COMPUTER SCIENCE AS PART OF THEIR CORE K. THROUGH TWELVE EDUCATION WE THINK ASSEMBLY MEMBER BERMAN FOR CHAMPIONING AB EIGHTEEN FIFTY THREE WHICH EXPANDS OPPORTUNITIES FOR PRE SERVICE TEACHERS TO GAIN ACCESS TO COMPUTER SCIENCE TRAINING COURSE FOR COMPETITOR G. AS WAS MENTIONED. IN CALIFORNIA ONLY OFTEN. OFFER ANY COMPUTER SCIENCE EDUCATION AT ALL THOSE SCHOOLS ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY IN SUBURBAN AND WEALTHIER COMMUNITIES. THE PRIMARY REASONS SCHOOLS DON'T TEACH AS A LACK OF TRAIN TEACHERS WERE PREPARED TO TEACH THIS CRITICAL SUBJECT. GOING TO K. THROUGH TWELVE COMPUTER SCIENCE. PRE SERVICE PIPELINE IS A FOUNDATIONAL STRATEGY FOR BRINGING COMPUTER SCIENCE TO OUR SCHOOLS PRE SERVICE TEACHERS ARE THE NEXT GENERATION OF EDUCATION LEADERS IN A POSITION TO TEACH FOUNDATIONAL COMPUTER SCIENCE SKILLS FOR A WORK FORCE. THAT NOW DEMANDS THE SKILLS. MULTIPLE SUBJECTS SEEKING ELEMENTARY PRE SERVICE TEACHERS ARE IDEAL CANDIDATES TO BENEFIT FROM THIS PROGRAM. AS THEY DON'T NEED A NEW CREDENTIAL. TO TEACH COMPUTER SCIENCE BUT RATHER HAVING FOUNDATIONAL TRAINING SUFFICIENT TO PREPARE STUDENTS. IN ORDER TO GIVE STUDENTS ACCESS EARLIER IN THEIR EDUCATION JOURNEY ITS CRUDE CRITICAL THAT WE HAVE ACCESS TO THOSE COURSES AND STARTING IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. AND WE KNOW STUDENTS WHO HAVE ACCESS EARLY ARE MORE LIKELY TO GO ON TO STUDY COMPUTER SCIENCES IN COLLEGE THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE FOR FEMALE STUDENTS AND STUDENTS OF COLOR. FINALLY THE CALIFORNIA STATE STRATEGIC IMPLEMENTATION PLAN FOR COMPUTER SCIENCE INCLUDES THIS AS A FOUNDATIONAL RECOMMENDATION TO ENSURE THAT WE'RE EXPANDING. COMPUTER SCIENCE BY BUILDING UP THE PRE SERVICE EDUCATION PIPELINE. FOR THESE REASONS WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS BILL THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU TO YOUR NEXT WITNESS. GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS LI ANY TARGET I'M TESTIFYING ON BEHALF OF TECHNET THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF ASSEMBLY BILL EIGHTEEN FIFTY THREE. AS YOU'RE ALL WELL AWARE CALIFORNIA IS HOME TO SOME OF THE MOST INNOVATIVE COMPANIES IN THE WORLD. IN ADDITION CALIFORNIANS OF ALL AGES ARE INCREASINGLY ACCESSING INFORMATION AND INTERACTING WITH EACH OTHER ONLINE. AS A NATURAL CONSEQUENCE JOBS IN THE SPACE ARE ALSO GROWING AND IN HIGH DEMAND. ABOUT SEVENTY SEVEN THOUSAND OPEN COMPUTING RELATED JOBS EACH MONTH. IN ORDER TO FILL THESE JOBS WITH A QUALIFIED WORKFORCE WE NEED TO MAKE SURE STUDENTS ARE ABLE TO ACCESS COMPUTER SCIENCE COURSEWORK. UNFORTUNATELY THAT'S NOT HAPPENING ACROSS THE STATE CURRENTLY LESS THAN HALF OF ALL CALIFORNIA PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS EVEN OFFER A COMPUTER SCIENCE COURSE. AND THE PRIMARY REASON FOR THAT IS A LACK OF TEACHERS TRAINED TO TEACH THE SUBJECT. AB EIGHTEEN FIFTY THREE IS CRITICAL TO EXPANDING THE NUMBER OF COMPUTER SCIENCE TEACHERS. INTRODUCING COMPUTER SCIENCE AT A YOUNG AGE WILL HELP TO ENSURE THAT ALL STUDENTS DEVELOP FOUNDATIONAL KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS. IN COMPUTER SCIENCE TO PREPARE THEM FOR COLLEGE CAREERS AND CIVIC ENGAGEMENT. AND WE CAN ACHIEVE THAT BY INVESTING MORE INTENTIONALLY AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR COMPUTER SCIENCE TEACHERS. IN TURN THIS WILL ALSO STRENGTHEN OUR PIPELINE OF TALENT INTO COMPUTER SCIENCE RELATED JOBS. ACROSS OUR STATE THAT MAKE CALIFORNIA SUCH A LEADER IN INNOVATION AND FOR THESE REASONS WE STRONGLY SUPPORT AB EIGHTEEN FIFTY THREE THANK YOU. GREAT THANK YOU ANY OTHER SUPPORT. I'M FOR THE MICROPHONE. GOOD AFTERNOON ASHLEY HOFFMAN ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE IN SUPPORT. BACK'S PERRY ON BEHALF OF COLLEGE BOARD AWESOME SPORT THANK YOU M.

MARKUPS IN CALIFORNIAN FIREMEN OF TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION NETWORK VERY MUCH REGRET COMING OUT IN OPPOSITION OF THIS BILL IT IS PUTTING THE CART BEFORE THE HORSE THE BIGGER PROBLEM WE HAVE TODAY IS TO DEFICIENCY OF GENERAL TECH TECHNOLOGY IN DID YOU GALES OF OUR TEACHERS AND STUDENTS THE EXPECTED THE DIGITAL SKILLS EXPECTATIONS OF POTENTIAL TO OF CREDENTIAL STUDENTS TEACHERS AND STUDENTS HAVE NOT CHANGED IN TWENTY YEARS THIS BILL NEEDS TO BE REWORKED TO INCLUDE SUPPORT THAT IS NEEDED FOR THE GENERAL DIGITAL AND TECHNOLOGY SKILL SETS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU I'M SEEING AFURTHER OPPOSITION ANY CONSUMMATE COMMITTEE MEMBERS ALL OF THIS MAY COMMENT I THINK WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO HEAR IS BUILD THE CAPACITY TO BUILD THE CAPACITY. RIGHT TRYING TO HELP PEOPLE THERE TO HELP STUDENTS SUCCEED IN A AND THE TECH TECHNOLOGICAL WORLD WHICH IS A BIG THING RIGHT THIS ABOUT THE FUTURE CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY SO I APPRECIATE- WHAT YOU'RE DOING. HERE TODAY A BUILDING THE PIPELINE URGE YOU TO DO IS REALLY HOLD AS IT AS THIS GOES FORWARD A BUDGET PLAN WHAT ARE THE SIGNS OF BEING YOU WATCH THE UNIVERSITIES THE COLLEGES BECAUSE THEY LOVE THE MONEY THEY DON'T LOVE THE ACCOUNTABILITY. WE NEED IS DEFINITELY SEE SOME OUTPUTS AND WHAT IS THE PRODUCT THEY'RE PRODUCING WITH THE MONEY. WE GIVE THEM BECAUSE OFTEN THEY COLLABORATE. THAT'S GREAT. GREAT BUT YOU DON'T DEVELOP PROGRAMS RIGHT GET THE MONEY AND SO THERE HAS TO BE SOMETHING ATTACHED THE MONEY IN THE END I WOULD HOPE SO PAY ATTENTION TO THE OPERATE HERE AND- SO WITH THAT- ANY OTHER. COMMENTS I MAKE ONE MORE COMMENT THAT IS HAVE TO MAKE- ONE OF THE BIG CHALLENGES WE'RE HAVING THE SCHOOLS RIGHT NOW I TALKED TO AN ASSISTANT SUPERINTENDENT THE OTHER DAY- AND SHE SAID I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS IS WHAT'S GOING ON OUT THERE RIGHT. AND SHE HAS A HARD TO GET CLASSIFIED STAFF SHOULD ABSOLUTELY THAT'S ALWAYS BEEN A CHALLENGE RIGHT SPECIAL ALWAYS MANAGES TO THE UNIQUE THING THAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW. THIS TEACHERS ARE LEAVING THE TEACHING PROFESSION MAJOR. CHANGES I'VE NEVER SEEN THAT BEFORE. USUALLY THEY GO TO ANOTHER DISTRICT RIGHT. BUT THEY'RE COMPLETELY LEAVING THE TEACHING PROFESSION SO YOU IF YOU LOOK AT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED BUDGET. WITH A FIVE POINT 33% COLA. WOEFULLY INADEQUATE YOUNGER PEOPLE SAY THAT'S A STARK. WILL CPI'S AND SEVEN POINT FIVE JURORS IN PERSON INCREASES OR TWO POINT THREE. RIGHT THERE ARE ALMOST TEN RIGHT. THEN YOU ADD ABOUT 4% COSTS THAT ARE UNIQUE TO SCHOOL DISTRICT COST PRESSURES NON CBI. DIRECT ABOUT THIRTEEN POINT 85% JUST STAY STATUS QUO. RIGHT WOULD LAST YEAR. AND YET THE MONEY IN THE ROSE BUDGET IS DRIVING MONEY AWAY FROM THE CLASSROOM AND ARGUABLY. AT LEAST FROM MY PERSPECTIVE CREATING A STRUCTURAL DEFICIT. THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS WE NEED TO CERTAINLY WHAT YOU'RE DOING HERE TODAY. BUT AS WE LOOK AS WE- START TO WORK ON THE BUDGET HELP YOU'LL PAY. ATTENTION TO THAT- MISTER ROOM BUT ALSO THOSE WHO CAME UP AND SPOKE SOME OF PRIVATE COMPANIES WE NEED YOUR HELP. TO GET THIS MONEY IN THE CLASSROOM LOWER SOME CLASS SIZES BECAUSE THAT SPEAKS TO STUDENT MENTAL OF. KNOW HOW AND ALSO TEACHER MENTAL HEALTH.

RESEARCHERS MEMBERS WHICH ACTUALLY THE CALIFORNIA STATE PATRIOTS COUNCIL THE WESTERN STATES COUNCIL SHEET METAL WORKERS. IN THE INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF PLUMBING AND MECHANICAL OFFICIALS AND WITH THESE COMMENTS LOW WHO ALSO TESTIFY. REALLY QUICKLY MR CHAIRMAN IN NINETEEN TWENTY A TWO THOUSAND AND TWENTY REPORT BY THE UC DAVIS WESTERN COOLING EFFICIENCY CENTER AND THE INDOOR ENVIRONMENTAL GROUP AT LAWRENCE BERKELEY NATIONAL LAB. FOUND THAT OVER HALF OF NEW SCHOOL H. FAX SYSTEMS HAD SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS WITHIN THREE YEARS OF INSTALLATION AND A VAST MAJORITY OF CLASSROOMS IN CALIFORNIA FAILED TO MEET MINIMUM VENTILATION RATES. FURTHERMORE NEARLY 20% OF THE CLASSROOMS AVERAGE YOUR TWO THOUSAND PARTS PER MILLION IN CO TWO. WELL OVER THE ELEVEN HUNDRED PPM MAXIMUM THAT IS WHAT RECOMMENDED AND WEALTH IN THE LAKE CLASSROOMS. COMBINED THESE UNDERPERFORMING SYSTEMS FAILED ME TAKE GOOD INDOOR AIR QUALITY AND THEY GET A DAILY IMPACTS TO HEALTH. IN ADDITION STUDIES HAVE FOUND THAT BETWEEN 3250% OF NEW H. FAX SYSTEMS. AND UP 285% OF REPLACEMENT SYSTEMS ARE INSTALLED INCORRECTLY LEADING THE UNDER PERFORMANCE THIS RESULTS. ACCORDING TO THE CPUC AND CAL FORTY INTERVIEW COMMISSION INCREASED ENERGY USE OF UP TO THIRTY PERCENT- WE WOULD URGE AN AYE VOTE. RESULTS GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS COMMENTS ON BEHALF OF THE SAME ORGANIZATIONS AND SCOTT JUST MENTIONED. AB TWENTY TWO TWENTY TWO THIRTY TWO IS AN IMPORTANT STEP TO ENSURING THAT OUR SCHOOLS HAVE EXPECTS ESTIMATES THAT ARE ENERGY EFFICIENT AND PROVIDES STUDENTS AND TEACHERS ADEQUATE VENTILATION. A RECENTLY PUBLISHED A TOWN STUDY SHOWS VENTILATION CAN CUT SCHOOL COVERT CASES BY EIGHTY TWO PERCENT. AS WE TRANSITION AWAY FROM MASK IN THE CLASSROOM IT'S CRITICAL THE TEACHERS AT LEAST HAVE THE PROTECTION PROVIDED BY PROPERLY OPERATING VENTILATION SYSTEMS. CURRENTLY TOTAL IT REQUIRES ANNUAL INSPECTIONS OF SCHOOL EXPECTS SYSTEMS BUSES NOT PROVIDING GUIDANCE AND WHAT THAT INSPECTION. INCLUDES OR HOOP WHAT QUALIFICATIONS ARE NEEDED FOR THE PEOPLE WHO DO THOSE INSPECTIONS. WHATEVER INSPECTIONS ARE CURRENTLY BEING DONE THE STUDY SAID SCOTT JUST MENTION SHOW THAT THE INSPECTION ARE NOT SUFFICIENT TO ENSURE ADEQUATE VENTILATION IN THE SCHOOLS. AFTER IN A SIXTY TWO POINT ONE IS A NATIONAL INDUSTRY STANDARDS SET FORTH ITS FAXES TO INSPECTION TESTING. REQUIREMENTS IT RECOMMENDS A COMPREHENSIVE INSPECTION AND VERIFICATION EVERY FIVE YEARS THIS BILL REQUIRES THAT SETS FORTH WHAT THAT WILL INCLUDE DOS REQUIRES CARBON MONOXIDE SENSORS IN THE CLASSROOM SO YOU KNOW DURING THE SCHOOL YEAR WE CAN MAKE SURE WE HAVE ADEQUATE VENTILATION AND CORRECT ANY. CHANGES IN THE VENTILATION RATES THAT OCCUR BECAUSE OF CLASS SIZE OR OTHER REASONS WE URGE A VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY OTHERS IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. MISTER CHAIRMAN BIRDS LIKE MONEY GOING TO BE HAVE THE CALIFORNIA STATE. BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION TRADES COUNCIL AND VERY STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU- S. SEEN OTHERS IN SUPPORT ANY OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. PRESS THE BUTTON RIGHT THERE. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS KATHLEEN DOMINGO AND I SPEAK TODAY ON BEHALF OF BOTH THE CALIFORNIA CATHOLIC CONFERENCE WHERE I SERVE AS EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR AND THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF PRIVATE SCHOOL ORGANIZATIONS OF WHICH I AM A DIRECTOR. APSO IS A STATE WIDE OR ASSOCIATION WITH TWENTY FOUR MEMBER ORGANIZATIONS THAT PROVIDE SERVICES TO FOURTEEN HUNDRED K. THROUGH TWELVE PRIVATE SCHOOLS AND ROLLED IN ROLLING APPROXIMATELY THREE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY THOUSAND STUDENTS ACROSS CALIFORNIA. SIX HUNDRED AND EIGHTEEN OF THOSE SCHOOLS ARE CATHOLIC SCHOOLS LOCATED IN TWELVE DIOCESES AND ARTS. THROUGHOUT THE STATE. WE REGARD THE GOALS AND INTENT OF AB TWENTY TWO TWENTY THIRTY TWO AS LAUDABLE WE MUST RESPECTFULLY TAKE AN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION. TO A MEASURE THAT WOULD IMPOSE A CRUSHING UNFUNDED MANDATE UPON THE STATE'S PRIVATE SCHOOLS. SIGNIFICANT FUNDING HAS BEEN PROVIDED TO PUBLIC SCHOOLS FOR THESE PURPOSES BUT NOT TO PRIVATE AND RELIGIOUS SCHOOLS. AB TWENTY TWO THIRTY TWOS REQUIREMENTS FOR PRIVATE SCHOOLS DO NOT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THAT ALREADY MANY OVERWHELMINGLY RELY UPON DEFICIT BUDGETING. AND AEROBIC FUNDRAISING EFFORTS JUST TO KEEP OUR DOORS OPEN. PRIVATE SCHOOLS ARE STILL REELING FROM THE DEVASTATING FINANCIAL IMPACT OF THE COVERED NINETEEN PANDEMIC AND THEY ARE STRUGGLING TO MANAGE COSTS IN A HIGHLY INFLATIONARY ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT. WE NEED TO MARSHAL WHATEVER ADDITIONAL RESOURCES WE CAN TO ADDRESS LEARNING LOSS AND REPAIR THE SOCIO EMOTIONAL DAMAGE INFLICTED UPON OUR CHILDREN BY THE TRAUMA AND DESTRUCTION OF THE PREVIOUS TWO YEARS. AB DE TO THIRTY TWO MIGHT BE A WONDERFUL OPPORTUNITY FOR SCHOOLS RECEIVING STATE FUNDING HOWEVER IT IS AN OVERWHELMING BURDEN TO PRIVATE SCHOOLS PARTICULARLY THERE IS THOSE SERVING LOW INCOME POPULATIONS. WE RESPECTFULLY ASK TO. MEANT THAT WHAT. APPLICATION DELTA PRIVATE AND PAROCHIAL SCHOOLS. THAT WOULD REMOVE OUR OPPOSITION TO AB TWENTY TWO THIRTY TWO. THE OTHER OPTION OF COURSE WOULD BE TO FIND THE COST OF THESE REQUIREMENTS FOR ALL SCHOOLS INCLUDING PRIVATE AND RELIGIOUS SCHOOLS THANK YOU. GREAT THANK YOU ANY FURTHER OPPOSITION CENA FURTHER OPPOSITION OVER IRAQ AND THE RAIL I JUST WANT TO START OFF BY SAYING THANK YOU MISTER MCCARTY AS A CLASSROOM TEACHER I KNOW INDOOR OR QUALITY PROBABLY BETTER THAN MOST I CAN TELL YOU WHEN YOU HAD THAT ONE PM OUR YOU'VE ALREADY PROBABLY HAD ABOUT A HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE PLUS KIDS IN THE ROOM RIGHT. CHANGING AROUND THE DAY. BUT I MEAN THAT'S A LOT OF ERROR. A LOT OF BREATH GOING INTO THE CLASSROOM AND AS ALWAYS LEAVE THAT CLASSROOM- I WOULD I WAS THE KIND OF TO YOUR EYES OUT OF MY DOOR OPEN AND A FAN BECAUSE I HAD TO. TURN THAT AIR OR JUST AS THOSE AFTERNOON HOURS LISTEN YOU REALLY FEEL IT AS AN ADULT I DID I CAN TELL YOU. RIGHT AND IMPACTS THE QUALITY OF EDUCATION BECAUSE IT IMPACTS A STUDENT'S ABILITY TO PAY ATTENTION READ THE GET TIRED THOSE ARE THE PHYSICAL EFFECTS. OF WHAT YOU WISH TO ADDRESS AVOID SO I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THAT TO THE PRIVATE SCHOOL ISSUE- I STRUGGLE WITH WHERE YOU'RE COMING FROM BECAUSE I THINK. PRIVATE SCHOOL STUDENTS TO. SHOULD HAVE THE ADVANTAGE OF HAVING- CLEANER IN THE CLASSROOM APPROPRIATE ERROR HOWEVER YOU WANT TO LABEL IT- AND IF YOU GO ON AMAZON THESE THINGS REALLY AREN'T. THAT EXPENSIVE TO MONITOR. THE AIR. RIGHT BECAUSE I LOOKED I THOUGHT ABOUT GETTING ONE FOR MY OWN CLASSROOM ONE TIME BECAUSE I WANT TO. CHECK CHECK WITH ALL THE STUFF MEANT BECAUSE I. YOU KNOW SINCE THERE WAS A PROBLEM ON- BUT AGAIN I APPRECIATE YOUR QUESTION I APPRECIATE YOU TALK ABOUT THE COST IMPLICATIONS EVEN THOUGH SOME PRIVATE SCHOOLS ARE VERY WELL FUNDED RIGHT. I GET THE POINT YOUR POINT IS PROBABLY THAT'S NOT ALL OUR RIGHT- SO I APPRECIATE. YOUR PERSPECTIVE WITHOUT ANY OF THE OTHER. COMMITTEE MEMBERS. MISTER BENNETT. I DID IT I JUST MIKE MY QUESTION FOR THE PRIVATE SCHOOL REPRESENTATIVES. THIS IS JUST IT IF THE H. FAX SYSTEM IS NOT WORKING PROPERLY AND THE CHILDREN ARE NOT GETTING GETTING CLEAN AIR. I ASSUME THAT YOUR POSITION AS YOU WILL YOU WANT THAT CORRECTED. WE WOULD LOVE TO HAVE THAT CORRECTED YES AND IN MANY CASES THAT INVOLVES SIGNIFICANT FUNDRAISING AT THE LEVEL OF THE SCHOOL- WE AGREE WITH THE PREMISE OF THIS BILL WE JUST CANNOT. TAKE ON THAT OVERWHELMING FINANCIAL BURDEN BUT IT IS IMPERATIVE TO CORRECT THAT PROBLEM IF IT EXISTS YES WE WOULD LIKE TO IF WE CAN'T. AND THEN THE QUESTION IS JUST HOW THE PEOPLE FUND THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. I'M ANY OTHER. MR CHEN. THANK YOU GEORGE JUANITA CLARIFICATION I WANT TO CLARIFY WHETHER OR NOT THE AUTHOR WAS TAKING AMENDMENTS THAT WOULD REMOVE THE MANDATE FOR THE PRIVATE SCHOOLS IS THAT- SOMETHING THAT IS GOING TO BE. A TAKE TO CONSIDERATION- WELL I DON'T KNOW THAT TODAY HE'S OPEN TO THAT HE WOULD HAVE TO APPOINT HERE'S WHY- TWO REASONS YOU KNOW WE DON'T SEE THE SCHOOL DISTRICT'S UP HERE. OPPOSING THE BAIL. BECAUSE I WOULD THINK TO KNOWING THAT YOUR EQUIPMENT IS NOT WORKING PROPERLY YOU WANNA KNOW THAT TOO. BECAUSE YOU'RE PAYING HIGHER MANY TIMES ENERGY BILLS ROM. EQUIPMENT IS NOT PROPERLY. INSTALLED THE FIRST TIME AS A HEARD FROM OUR WITNESSES. AND SECONDLY- QUALITIES ARE QUALITY I KNOW THAT TWO YEARS AGO. RIGHT HERE IN MY CITY SACRAMENTO WE HAD THE WORST AIR QUALITY IN THE WORLD. FOR THREE STRAIGHT DAYS WHY BECAUSE FIRES UP THERE UP NORTH AND SO THE KIDS ARE TOO DIFFICULT TIME LEARNING AND FOCUSING. AND HAVING TO BE RIDICULOUS TO HAVE. ALL THE PRIVATE SCHOOLS AB ONE RULES OTHER HERE BUT LET'S GET THEIR KIDS ARE KIDS AND PUBLIC HEALTH IS PUBLIC HEALTH SO- WILL BE WILLING TO LISTEN TO THE ISSUES BUT I THINK OVERALL. WE DO A LOT OF THINGS IN THE PUBLIC HEALTH CODE RELATES TO ALL SCHOOLS. THIS IS ONE RIGHT NOW I THINK ALL SCHOOLS. THANK YOU. UP THERE HAS BEEN MISTER BENNETT IT IS JUST ONE OF WHAT TO ECHO THAT WHAT WAS THE POINT OF MY QUESTION TO THE PRIVATE SCHOOLS THAT IS- I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD HAVE A SEPARATE SEPARATE STANDARDS SO I CERTAINLY AGREE WITH THE AUTHOR- AN EXCEPTION.

TWENTY FOUR OH ONE TWENTY FOUR ONE FIVE AND IN NINETEEN THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THIS IS A- ISSUE THAT YOU ARE NICE BUT A LOT OF TIME TALKING ABOUT IN OUR BUDGET SUB COMMITTEE WE HAD A DIALOGUE EARLIER WITH MR BERMAN HIS BILL ABOUT THE TEACHER SHORTAGE AND THE WORK WE NEED TO DO TO GET MORE TEACHERS IN THE CLASSROOM ASSEMBLY PUT WE'RE NOT- WE'RE NOT DOING A GOOD JOB AT KEEPING UP- CERTAINLY PEOPLE IN THE PIPELINE BUT ALSO PEOPLE LEAVING THEIR PROFESSION. THIS WILL HELP ADDRESS OUR TEACHER SHORTAGE BY SUPPORTING THE EXPANSION OF INTEGRATED TEACHER PREP PROGRAMS THAT OUR CALLS UNIVERSITIES ACTUALLY DO WHAT YOU'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT NO MORE I'M NOT AS MUCH PLANNING BUT ACTUALLY MORE DOING OH YES WE DO ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS FOCUSING ON THIS ON THIS PIECE I WE DO NOT WE STARTED THIS A DECADE OR SO AGO BUT WE REALLY NEED TO STEP IT UP ACCORDING TO THE LEARNING POLICY INSTITUTE. IN ROMAN ART TEACHER PROGRAMS HAVE DECLINED BY TWO THIRDS OVER THE LAST ROUGHLY TWO DECADES AT THE SAME TIME THE DEMAND YOUR HIRES HAS OUTPACED THE NUMBER OF CANDIDATES COMPLETING THESE PROGRAMS SINCE THE PANDEMIC DISTRICT HAVE FACED NEW CHALLENGES INCREASED NUMBER OF TEACHER RETIREMENTS AND RESIGNATIONS SOMETIMES MID YEAR AS YOU NOTED. THIS PUTS DISTRICT IN A TOP POSITION TO RELY ON UNDER TEACHERS WHO HAVEN'T COMPLETED THEIR CREDENTIALS HAVE EMERGENCY CREDENTIALS ARE WORSE SUBSTITUTES ARE WORSE NO TEACHERS I WE NEED MORE QUALIFIED TEACHERS AND RIGHT NOW YOU KNOW HOW THE RULES ARE YOU GET A DEGREE IN FOUR YEARS YOU CAN GET A JOB LIKE YOUR FRIENDS COLLEAGUES DO YOU CAN DECIDE YOU WILL BECOME A TEACHER BUT A SCHOOL FRIEND NOTHER YEAR GET MORE DEBT FOR GO A YEAR OF INCOME TO GET A JOB IN TEACHING THAT SOMETIMES PAYS LESS THAN YOUR FRIENDS ARE GETTING WITH A FOUR YEAR DEGREE. SO ONE WAY WE CAN ADDRESS THIS IS HAVING MORE INTEGRATED TEACHER PREP PROGRAM SO YOU DO A BOTH WHILE YOU'RE GETTING YOUR UNDERGRADUATE DEGREE AT THIS BILL OF COURSE WILL HAVE A FOCUS ON SURE RICH FIELD SUCH A SPECIAL. AD BILINGUAL. STEM IN E. C. E. THIS CAN BE A WIN WIN FOR CALIFORNIA. OUR SCHOOLS AND CERTAINLY OUR TEACHERS I WITH ME TODAY ARE TWO WITNESSES RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR ABOUT. OF ONE WITH. BY. YEAH. GOOD AFTERNOON I'M MY NAME'S ERIK BAHNSON I AM THE SUPERINTENDENT WITH THE PLACERVILLE SCHOOL DISTRICT- AND I'M ALSO HERE REPRESENTING THE SMALL SCHOOL DISTRICT ASSOCIATION- AS YOU KNOW SMALL SCHOOL DISTRICTS SOCIAIS ASIAN- REPRESENTS OVER TWO THIRDS OF THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS WITHIN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SCHOOL DISTRICTS OF STUDENT OF EIGHTY A TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED OR BELOW- WE'RE WE ARE PROUD TO SUPPORT- AB TWENTY FOUR OH ONE AND THANK ASSEMBLY- MCCARTY FOR AUTHORIZING THIS IMPORTANT BILL- THIS COMMITTEE AS WELL WHERE THE SEVERE TEACHER SHORTAGE- AND IT IS GETTING WORSE- THE TEACHER SHORTAGE. ALSO HAVE SMALL SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND HIT SMALLER DISTRICTS WILL DISTRICTS HARD- FOR EXAMPLE I'LL JUST GIVE A PERSONAL EXAMPLE OF THIS- I HAVE I HAVE SIXTY SIX TEACHERS WITHIN MY DISTRICT. I HAVE TWELVE THEY'RE LEAVING AT THE END OF THE SCHOOL YEAR. OF CLOSE 220% OF MY TEACHING FORCES LEAVING THAT I'M GONNA NEED REPLACE- CALLOUS EFFORTS ARE BEING MADE TO REPLACE THESE THESE TEACHERS THEY ARE DONE THROUGH LOOKING WITHIN THE STATE OUT OF STATE AND EVEN OUT OF THE COUNTRY- AND FOR US TO BE ABLE TO REPLACE THE POSITIONS THAT WE HAVE- THIS ADDRESS SO BEING NOT BEING REPLACED IS NOT A DIRECT DIRECT RESULT OF. THE EFFORT THAT IS BEING DONE. IT'S CONCERNING BECAUSE WE ON'T KNOW THE FULL TIME P. CREDENTIALS ARE THE BEST WAY FOR OUR STUDENTS TO LEARN. AND HAVING SUBSTITUTES OR EVEN NON CREDENTIALED TEACHERS IN THE CLASSROOM IS NOT THE WAY TO GO. S. STA APPRECIATE THE AMOUNT OF ATTENTION THIS COMMITTEE HAS FOCUSED ON ADDRESSING THE TEACHER SHORTAGE AS WELL AS ADDRESSING OTHER SHORTAGES- FOR MULTI PRONGED APPROACH. GROWING THE INTEGRATED TEACHER PROGRAM IS AN IMPORTANT PIECE OF THE PUZZLE. THESE PROGRAMS ARE CRITICAL TO HELPING BUILD AND SUSTAIN OUR TEACHERS WORKFORCE AS A TRACK PEOPLE INTO THE WORKFORCE WILL LIKELY WOULDN'T PURSUE THIS FILLED OTHERWISE. THESE PROGRAMS ALSO PRODUCE FULLY QUALIFIED TEACHER AT A FASTER PACE. I RECEIVED MY TEACHER CREDENTIAL PROGRAM THROUGH PROGRAM JUST LIKE THIS. AS POINTED OUT IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS EVIDENCE SHOWS THAT INTEGRATED TEACHER PREPARATION PROGRAMS HAS SUCCESSFULLY PRODUCED A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF POTENTIAL TEACHERS. S. IS THE A PRE SHAVE THE AUTHOR AND THE COMMITTEE'S COMMITMENT TO ENSURING THAT THE PROGRAM FOCUSES ON PRODUCING TEACHER SHORTAGE AREAS. THANKS AGAIN AND RE RESPECTFULLY. REQUEST YOUR SUPPORT. RIGHT THANK YOU YOU HAVE ANOTHER WITNESS IN SUPPORT. UP IT USED TO SORRY YOUR BACKS IS LIKE A FIELD TRIP WHAT YOU BELIEVE IT- MISTER CHAIRMAN JEFF FROST REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF SUBURBAN DISTRICTS SCHOOL DISTRICTS- WE DON'T HAVE A FORMAL POSITION YET BECAUSE OUR COMMITTEE HAS NOT MET. BUT THIS IS AN ISSUE- THAT WE HAVE LONG SUPPORTED THE CONCEPT OF CREATING TEACHER COLLEGES IS DONE EVERYWHERE EXCEPT IN CALIFORNIA- IN THIS APPROACH IS GOING TO GET TO EXACTLY WHAT YOUR FIRST WITNESS TALKED ABOUT. THE GREAT BUILT AND- WE SUPPORT THANK YOU OTHERS IN SUPPORT. SEE NO OTHERS IN SUPPORT I JUST WANNA COMMENT COULD BE ALMOST MCCARTY- I SEE YOU HAVE THE CTC ADMINISTERING THIS I HOPE THEY GET BACK IN THEIR OFFICES SOON AND OPEN THEM SO THEY- CAN ADMINISTER THIS. AS I CALLED OVER THE OTHER DAY AND REALIZE THAT. NO ONE ANSWERS THE PHONE THEY DON'T PHONE NUMBER BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT THEY'RE- BUT I THINK THE COMING BACK SHORTLY. SO HOPEFULLY- I CAN GIVE THEY WILL MISS AND A GOOD CELL PHONE NUMBER IF YOU WANT A ARE EXACTLY- BUT I MEAN. SO I HAVE AN ISSUE AS A TEACHER. YES HOW MANY DREADED THOUSAND OTHER TEACHERS AND STATE THAT. PROBABLY NEED SERVICE FROM THE CDC TO PROVIDE A CLOSED. SO BUT THAT'S ANOTHER ISSUE- BUT EITHER WAY I. LISTEN I WE MADE A LEGISLATIVE CHANGE A FEW YEARS AGO WITH MY BILL RIGHT THAT ALLOWED. FOR TEACHERS TO COMBINE. THE CREDENTIAL EXPERIENCE IN THAT FOR YEARS. AND NOW WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO HERE IS BUILD UPON THAT. I WOULD JUST SAY SOMETHING I STATED EARLIER IS. AS WE GET THIS MONEY OUT. WE NEED TO SEE RESULTS RIGHT IT CAN'T JUST BE THAT THEY COLLABORATED THEY PLANNED. IT'S GONNA BE WHAT ARE THEY PRODUCE RIGHT. BECAUSE THIS TO ME IS A NO BRAINER AS FAR AS AN AVERAGE. OF THE OTHER NO BRAINERS LOWERING CLASS SIZES. BECAUSE YOUR NEW TEACHER CALIFORNIA IS THE LARGEST CLASS SIZES. IT'S KILLER OUT THERE WHEN YOUR NEW TEACHER TO HAVE THIRTY FIVE THIRTY SIX KIDS IN A CLASSROOM ABOUT. AYE WHAT WHAT AT THIRTY SIX. AS A NEW MIDDLE SCHOOL TEACHER. RIGHT THEY CAN EAT YOU ALIVE REAL QUICK IF YOU'RE NOT PREPARED. YOU KNOW YOU ARE PREPARED THEY'RE GONNA TRY IT'S THEIR JOB THEIR EIGHTH GRADERS RIGHT- SO WITH THAT THANK YOU FOR THE BILL'S MCCARTY ANY. OTHER COMMENTS- MISTER LEE.

FILE ITEM NINETEEN AB TWENTY FOUR OH ONE THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS O'DONNELL HI THE DONAL I'D DALY. ALII SENATE SENATE SENATE I CAN N. I. LI LI I MCCARTY MCCARTY AYE QUIRK-SILVA. THE BILL HAS SIX VOTED IS ALISTAIR MCCARTY THANK YOU WITH THAT WILL GO TO FILE ITEM NUMBER FOUR FINE REFORMISTS RIVAS. IT'S AB EIGHTEEN SIXTY EIGHT. GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS I WANT TO START BY THANKING YOUR COMMITTEE STAFF FOR WORKING WITH MY OFFICE ON THIS BILL I WOULD LIKE TO ACCEPT THE AMENDMENTS PROPOSED BY THE COMMITTEE. AB EIGHTEEN SIXTY EIGHT- WOULD HELP BETTER UNDERSTAND THE NEEDS OF ENGLISH LEARNERS WHO REQUIRE ADDITIONAL ASSISTANCE THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE ENGLISH LEARNER GROWTH AND ACHIEVEMENT DATA TO BE PROPERLY COLLECTED AND UPLOADED TO THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION'S WEBSITE FOR THE PUBLIC TO VIEW. ABOUT ONE POINT ONE FIVE MILLION ENGLISH LEARNER STUDENTS ARE ENROLLED IN CALIFORNIA'S PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND OF THESE STUDENTS ARE LONG TERM ENGLISH LEARNERS. ANOTHER A HUNDRED THIRTY THOUSAND ENGLISH LEARNER STUDENTS ARE AT RISK OF BECOMING LONG TERM ENGLISH LEARNERS. CURRENTLY ALL TYPES OF ENGLISH LEARNER STUDENTS ARE CLASSIFIED INTO A SINGLE CATEGORY OF THEIR LEARNING STATUS WITHOUT REGARD TO THEIR SEPARATE LEVELS OF ENGLISH PROFICIENCY. THIS MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO IDENTIFY THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF ENGLISH LEARNERS AND THEIR RESPECTIVE ACHIEVEMENTS PROGRESS AND THEIR NEEDS WITHOUT THE ABILITY TO PROPERLY DIFFERENTIATE THE UNIQUE ENGLISH LEARNER STUDENT GROUPS. CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS WILL NOT BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THEM WITH THE SUPPORT THAT THEY NEED TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN SCHOOL. AB EIGHTEEN SIXTY EIGHT WILL ALLOW THE STATE TO BETTER SERVE OUR ENGLISH LEARNERS BY REQUIRING CD TO FURTHER SEPARATE ACHIEVEMENT AND ROMAN AND OTHER OUTCOMES FOR LONG TERM ENGLISH LEARNERS AND STUDENTS AT RISK OF BECOMING LONG TERM. ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS TODAY I HAVE WITH ME TO PROVIDE TESTIMONY OF MANUEL WHEN DRAW STRONG ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR OF POLICY FOR CALIFORNIANS TOGETHER. AND DOCTOR MUCH MARLENE BATTISTA DIRECTOR OF CERTIFICATED. HUMAN RESOURCES FOR THE OXNARD SCHOOL DISTRICT. THANK YOU TO YOUR WITNESSES. I THINK PRESS THE BOOK THERE SHOULD BE A BUTTON DOWN THERE M. I. C. GREAT WELL GOOD EVENING EVERYBODY- I'M- HAPPY TO BE HERE TODAY TO TALK ABOUT THIS VERY IMPORTANT. PIECE OF LEGISLATION THAT WE HOPE WILL SUPPORT. ADDITIONAL TRANSPARENCY FOR LONG TERM ENGLISH LEARNERS AND OUR STUDENTS AT RISK OF BECOMING LONG TERM ENGLISH LEARNERS. OVER THE PAST DECADE CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN A LEADER ON THE ISSUE OF ALLTEL'S. CORNING THE TERM AND DEVELOPING THE ROBUST DEFINITION THAT WE HAVE TODAY. AS YOU MAY KNOW LONG TERM ENGLISH LEARNERS OR ELL TELLS OUR ENGLISH LEARNERS WHO HAVE BEEN ENROLLED IN U. S. SCHOOLS. FOR SIX OR MORE YEARS AND WHO HAVE REMAINED AT THE SAME LEVEL OF ENGLISH LANGUAGE PROFICIENCY OR REGRESSED FOR TWO CONSECUTIVE YEARS. SO THESE ARE STUDENTS ARE STUCK IN THE SYSTEM. BY DEFINITION ALL LONG TERM ENGLISH LEARNERS OUR STUDENTS AND OUR SECONDARY SCHOOLS THAT MEANS THAT THESE ARE STUDENTS IN GRADES SIX TO TWELVE. AND WHEN WE LOOK AT THE DATA- BRIGHT BEFORE THE PANDEMIC FOR THAT NINETEEN TWENTY SCHOOL YEAR. WE KNOW THAT NEARLY HALF OF ALL ENGLISH LEARNERS IN GRADES SIX TO TWELVE. OUR LONG TERM ENGLISH LEARNERS. THESE ARE OVER TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND STUDENTS IN OUR SYSTEM. MOREOVER WHEN WE LOOK AT THE PERCENTAGE OF THE STUDENTS THAT ARE DULY IDENTIFIED A STUDENTS TO DISABILITIES WE SEE THAT 36% OF THE STUDENTS ARE DULY IDENTIFIED. AB EIGHTEEN SIXTY EIGHT SIXTY SIX TO MAKE THE STUDENTS MORE VISIBLE BY ENSURING THAT ACHIEVEMENT AND SPECIAL EDUCATION DATA IS FURTHER DISAGGREGATED BY L. TELLS. AND STUDENTS AT RISK OF BECOMING OUTHOUSE FOR THAT ARE DISTRICTS AND SCHOOLS HAVE THE INFORMATION THAT THEY NEED TO BETTER SUPPORT TEACHERS AND STAFF. TO SERVE THE UNIQUE NEEDS OF THE STUDENTS. MOREOVER THIS WOULD NOT CREATE ANY ADDITIONAL REPORTING BURDEN FOR DISTRICTS THE DATA REQUESTED IN THIS LEGISLATION. IS ALREADY REPORTED TO THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION- THROUGH THE DISTRICTS VOTER REQUIRE ANY ADDITIONAL REPORTING BY DISTRICTS. GO AGAIN FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK ABOUT THIS VERY IMPORTANT PIECE OF LEGISLATION. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME'S DR MARLENE BATTISTA AND I'M THE DIRECTOR OF% CERTIFICATED HUMAN RESOURCES FOR OXNARD SCHOOL DISTRICT BUT I'M HERE REPRESENTING CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION FOR BILINGUAL EDUCATORS ONE OF THEIR BOARD MEMBERS. WE BELIEVE THERE'S A NEED TO BE PROACTIVE IN OUR CONTINUING APPROACH TO ENSURE OUR LONG TERM ENGLISH LEARNERS ARE PROVIDED WITH THE NECESSARY SUPPORT AND PROGRAMS THEY NEED TO BE SUCCESSFUL. WE KNOW THE PANDEMIC HAS CREATED LEARNING LOTS FOR ALL STUDENTS BUT MOST ESPECIALLY OUR ENGLISH LEARNERS AND HAS PUT MANY MORE STUDENTS AT RISK OF BECOMING LONG TERM ENGLISH LEARNERS. OUR CURRENT SYSTEM FOR DISAGGREGATED DATA FOR CALIFORNIA'S LONG TERM ENGLISH LEARNERS DOES NOT PROVIDE ADEQUATE INFORMATION TO MONITOR THEIR ACHIEVEMENT LEAVING US WITHOUT VALUABLE DATA ENABLING US TO MAKE CHANGES TO OUR SYSTEM OF SUPPORT FOR THE STUDENTS. ABEIGHTEEN SIXTY EIGHT WILL PROVIDE A MORE COMPREHENSIVE LOOK INTO THE CONSTRUCT USED TO SERVE THE STUDENTS BY ALLOWING US TO BREAK DOWN SPECIAL EDUCATION DATA BY ENGLISH LANGUAGE STATUS TYPE OF DISABILITY AND SPECIFIC LEARNING DISABILITY CATEGORY. ADDITIONALLY A. B. ONE EIGHT SIX EIGHT WILL ENABLE US TO STUDY THE ACHIEVEMENT AND ROMAN AS WELL AS OUR OUTLOOK OTHER OUTCOMES OF OUR EXISTING LONG TERM ENGLISH LEARNERS STUDENTS AS WELL AS THOSE THAT ARE AT REST FOR BECOMING A LONG TERM ENGLISH LEARNERS. HOW MAY BELIEVE THIS IS AN IMPORTANT BILL IS A FUNDAMENTAL STEP THAT WILL ALLOW OUR STATE TO EVALUATE WHETHER WERE ADEQUATELY SERVING THE STUDENTS BY CREATING SUCCESSFUL POLICIES AND STRATEGIES TO HELP OUR LONG TERM ENGLISH LEARNERS TO TRULY SUCCEED. ON BEHALF OF COPY I URGE YOU AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU. OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS BRIAN RIVAS ON BEHALF OF THE EDUCATION TRUST WEST IN SUPPORT.

THE SIX FOOT SO IT IS I WILL MOVE YOUR NEXT ON THIS RIVAS WHICH IS AB I'D FILE ITEM NUMBER FIVE FILE ITEM NUMBER FIVE AB NINETEEN THIRTY NINE YOU A PROCEED WHEN READY THANK YOU THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS I WANT TO START BY ONCE AGAIN THANKING YOUR COMMITTEE STAFFER WORKING WITH MY OFFICE ON THE BILL AND I'D LIKE TO ACCEPT THE AMENDMENTS PROPOSED BY THE COMMITTEE. AB NINETEEN THIRTY NINE WOULD FOSTER YOUTHS PASSION FOR LEARNING ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE AND WAYS TO MITIGATE ITS EFFECTS THIS BILL WOULD MAKE CLIMATE CHANGE OF COURSE REQUIREMENT FOR GRADES ONE THROUGH TWELVE SO THAT OUR FUTURE LEADERS CAN GAIN THE KNOWLEDGE THEY NEED TO CREATE. A SUSTAINABLE FUTURE. IN TWENTY SIXTEEN. A REPORT BY STANFORD UNIVERSITY EXAMINED HOW ENVIRONMENTAL LITERACY HAD BENEFITED STUDENTS. FROM NURSERY SCHOOL TO SECONDARY SCHOOL. THE STUDY FOUND. THAT 83% OF STUDENTS IMPROVE THEIR ENVIRONMENTAL BEHAVIOR. STUDENTS WHO ARE BEING EDUCATED ABOUT THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE ARE CLEARLY BETTER PREPARED TO FIGHT FOR A BETTER FUTURE. BUT NOT ALL CHILDREN ARE BEING PROVIDED THE OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN. I ALSO KNOW THAT YOUNG PEOPLE WANT TO LEARN ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE IN SCHOOL THEY'RE DEMANDING THIS AND THIS IS OUR OPPORTUNITY TO OFFER THIS COURSE IN THE REGULAR SCHOOL DAY. CALIFORNIA HAS CERTAINLY MADE SOME PROGRESS ON ADVANCING CLIMATE CHANGE LITERACY BUT THERE REMAINS MUCH WORK TO BE DONE TO TEACH THESE TOPICS AND OUR SCHOOLS SINCE THE STATE'S ATTEMPTS TO TEACH ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE REMAIN OPTIONAL. RECOGNIZING THAT EDUCATION IS THE FIRST STEP IN COMBATING CLIMATE CHANGE IT ONLY TOOK THE INITIATIVE MANDATING CLIMATE CHANGE EDUCATION IN EVERY SCHOOL GRADE. MEXICO QUICKLY FOLLOWED AND AMENDED THEIR CONSTITUTION TO INCLUDE CLIMATE CHANGE AS A REQUIREMENT OF EDUCATION. MEANWHILE IN THE US NEW JERSEY IS THE FIRST STATE TO REQUIRE SCHOOLS TO TEACH CLIMATE CHANGE BEHIND OTHER STATES AND COUNTRIES THAT TEACH ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE AS A RESULT WERE MISSING CRITICAL OPPORTUNITIES TO TEACH THOSE WHO WILL BE BEST POSITIONED TO HELP DELIVER THE SOLUTIONS TO MITIGATE AND ADAPT TO CLIMATE CHANGE. AB NINETEEN THIRTY NINE WILL EMPOWER STUDENTS TO FIND CLIMATE CHANGE SOLUTIONS BY MAKING CLIMATE CHANGE A STATE EDUCATION PRIORITY. TODAY I HAVE WITH ME TO PROVIDE TESTIMONY REBEKAH FRANK CO FOUNDER OF SIERRA CLUB CLIMATE LITERACY COMMITTEE UP FROM THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA CHAPTER. THANK. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU. I WILL PROBABLY ALL HEARD ABOUT GRETA AS IN GREATER BURKE THE SWEDISH CLIMATE ACTIVIST. BUT HOW ABOUT RISHI OR ELLA- SHERA FOR AARON. THOSE ARE SOME OF THE STUDENTS THE CLIMATE LITERACY TEAM WAS LUCKY ENOUGH TO WORK WITHIN SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO PASS RESOLUTIONS SUPPORTING A CLIMATE CURRICULA. IN FACT I'M NOT SURE WE WOULD HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL WITHOUT THE ENERGY OF THESE ACTIVISTS. ON THE ONE HAND THEY HAVE RECOGNIZE THE DARKNESS OF OUR SITUATION. ACCORDING TO THE U. N. EVEN IF NATIONAL COMMITMENTS TO REDUCE EMISSIONS BY TWENTY THIRTY OR KEPT THE TEMPERATURE WILL CONTINUE TO INCREASE TO TWO POINT SEVEN DEGREES CENTIGRADE. BY THE END OF THE CENTURY EXITING THE CRUCIAL MAXIMUM OF ONE POINT FIVE DEGREES. THESE ACTIVISTS KNOW THAT GREENHOUSE GASES NEED TO BE REDUCED BY HALF BY TWENTY THIRTY TO AVOID THIS OUTCOME. ON THE OTHER HAND THEY ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT MANY OF THEIR FELLOW STUDENTS DON'T FULLY UNDERSTAND CLIMATE CHANGE. OR FEEL POWERLESS TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT. AND THROUGH EXPERIENCE THEY SAY THE GAPS AND HOW CLIMATE CHANGE IS COVERED IN CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS IT'S NOT ABSENT BUT ITS BODY. THESE GAPS CAN BE NARROWED THROUGH THIS BILL ESTABLISHING REQUIREMENTS FOR ALL OF THE STATE'S ONE THOUSAND PLUS DISTRICTS. AS PART OF SCIENCE INSTRUCTION STUDENTS WILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN ABOUT WHAT'S CAUSING THE CLIMATE TO CHANGE ITS EFFECTS ON THEIR LIVES AND COMMUNITIES. THE ACTIONS WHICH CAN BE TAKEN TO COUNTERACT THE EFFECTS AND THE WAY USED TO ADOPT THE INEVITABLE CHANGES. EDUCATION IS VITAL TO OVERCOME LACK OF KNOWLEDGE AND MISCONCEPTION AND TO LAY A FOUNDATION FOR ACTION. IF WE THINK THAT WE HAVE HAD TO MAKE HARD CHOICES UP TO NOW ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE WE CAN BE CERTAIN THEY WILL BECOME INCREASINGLY HARDER. YET THEY MAY NOT HAPPEN OR AT LEAST NOT HAPPEN QUICKLY ENOUGH WITHOUT THE SUPPORT OF TODAY'S STUDENTS. CALIFORNIA'S FUTURE TAXPAYERS VOTERS AND LEGISLATORS. THE ONLY WAY WE CAN AVOID EVER WORSENING EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE FOR THIS AND FUTURE GENERATIONS US TO WORK TOGETHER. RELYING ON EDUCATED PUBLIC SUPPORTIVE OF TAKING WELL INFORMED ACTION. AT BOTH THE POLICY AND THE PERSONAL LEVELS. THIS BILL GETS IS MOVING IN THE NEED A DIRECTION PLEASE PLEASE ARTIST. THE JOB THANK YOU I CANNOT ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS ROSS BARKLEY ABOUT THE CITY OF SACRAMENTO IN SUPPORT. MISTER CHAIRMAN STEVE BAKER WITH THEIR AND REDUCES HIS FOR TEN STRANDS IN SUPPORT.

THANK YOU ANY OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. IMPORTER. MARK ABSTAINED CALIFORNIAN FIRE MENTAL TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION NETWORK THE PROBLEM WITH THIS BILL WITH THE TEACHING OF CLIMATE CHANGE OUTSIDE OF THE CONTEXT OF A COMPREHENSIVE- SCIENCE OR EARTH SYSTEMS COURSE LEADS TO- EAT E. E. D. E. A WAX PROVIDING STUDENTS WITH A CUT COMPREHENSIVE UNDERSTANDING OF THE ISSUE I HAVE SEEN IT CLASSROOMS CLIMATE CHANGE BEING TAUGHT IN ISOLATION AND IT DOESN'T REALLY COVER THE NEED AND THE DETAIL AND THE COMPLEXITY OF THE ISSUE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. TINO FOR THEIR OPPOSITION GOING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE DO WE HAVE A MOTION. EVERY MOVES AT ITS SECOND BY STALLING. OF THREE ON A SECOND THIS. MOREOVER YEAH MISTER BENNETT OKAY SO WITH THAT MR- THE VICE CHAIR IS A QUESTION. ASSEMBLY MEMBER DINO I HAVE A QUESTION SO. BEFORE I HAVE IN THE ASSEMBLY I SERVE ON THE SCHOOL BOARD SO I'M JUST WITH MY UNDERSTANDING IS THE SCIENCE FRAMEWORK IS OP AND TWENTY TWENTY FIVE TO FOR TEXTBOOKS AND CURRICULUM TO BE. YOU KNOW READOPTED AND TO MAKE THE IMPORTANT I. BELIEVE THE CLIMATE CHANGE IS IMPORTANT FOR STUDENTS TO BE LEARNING AND I DO HAVE CHILDREN IN SCHOOL AND THEY ARE LEARNING. ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE AND MADE IT MAY BE SPOTTY I'M- NOT AN EXPERT ON THAT. BUT I'M JUST WONDERING IF YOU HAD CONSIDERED WAITING FOR THAT TWENTY TWENTY FIVE SO THAT THERE WOULD BE TIME. FOR SCHOOL BOARDS AND TEACHERS AND ADMINISTRATORS MINISTRATIONS TO WEIGH IN ON TO MAKE SURE THAT CURRICULUM. WAS READY TO BE ADOPTED. YEAH RIGHT NOW- THIS BECOMES IN EFFECT THE TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR SCHOOL YEAR. ARE THERE ALREADY IS CURRICULUM OUT THERE- THAT TEACHES ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE AND LIKE YOU SAID SOME SCHOOLS ARE DOING IT- WHICH IS GREAT AND YOU KNOW A LOT OF SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAVE MADE THIS A PRIORITY- BUT RIGHT NOW IT IS STILL OPTIONAL. RIGHT AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE INCLUDING IT AS PART OF THE INSTRUCTION. OF LIKE BECAUSE THE CUT THE CURRICULUM IT IS THERE AND READY FOR TEACHERS TO USE. OF THAT'S WHY WE'RE WE WANT TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THAT. YOU KNOW MAKE THIS TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR SCHOOL YEAR. GREAT THANK YOU IT IS IN THE FRAMEWORK. NAY THAT THAT JUST JUST KNOW THAT AND- ONE OF THE THINGS- WE DID HAVE A CONVERSATION I WAS WHEN I MAKING THIS OR- A GRADUATION REQUIREMENT YES OUR STUDENTS DO NOT NEED ONE MORE. GRADUATION REQUIREMENT. HEY THIS BUILDING SEEMS TO HIT GRADUATION REQUIREMENTS ON LIKE THERE. YOU KNOW. WHATEVER YOU WANT- THAT IS A PRETTY IMPORTANT TOPIC I TAUGHT IT AND COME TO MY OFFICE INITIALLY WHEN I TAUGHT- BUT AGAIN IF PEOPLE ARE GONNA COME FORWARD WITH ONE MORE GRADUATION REQUIREMENT I WANT TO IT TO YOU'RE GONNA TAKE OFF BECAUSE- WHAT WE'RE DOING IS WE'RE ACTUALLY BECAUSE I HAD THAT I THOUGHT ACTUALLY WAS ELECTIVES GEOGRAPHY. RIGHT MANY G. BUT EITHER WAY IT WAS ELECTED- SO THAT THAT THAT YOU KNOW WE DO A LITTLE BIT OF PUSH BACK ON THAT JUST BECAUSE AGAIN. EVERYBODY WANTS A NEW GRADUATION REQUIREMENT NO ONE WANTS TO REMOVE ONE. AND THAT'S A REALLY CHALLENGING. FOR OUR HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS IN OUR HIGH SCHOOLS TO IMPLEMENT WHAT THEY'VE ALREADY GOT SO MANY. THINGS THEY HAVE TO DO. AND ARE ALREADY UNDER FUNDED BUT YOU DON'T HEAR THAT SPEECH AGAIN. ALL RIGHT AWAY THAT- YOU CALLS. I HAVEN'T BUT- I KNOW I DID ACCEPT YOUR AMENDMENTS MISTER CHAIR- THANK YOU FOR WORKING WITH ME ON THIS BILL AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. GREAT THANK YOU.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS AND COMMITTEE STAFF FOR YOUR TIME AND FOR WORKING WITH ME TO IMPROVE THIS BILL. I'LL START BY SAYING THAT WE'VE ACCEPTED THE COMMITTEE'S PROPOSED AMENDMENTS. AB TWO SIX FOUR ZERO THE ZAKI BILL AS AN IMPORTANT MEASURE THAT WILL HELP ENSURE THAT PARENTS CAREGIVERS EDUCATORS AND STUDENTS ALL HAVE ACCESS TO COMPREHENSIVE INFORMATION. AND STRATEGIES TO REDUCEALLERGIC REACTIONS ON SCHOOL CAMPUSES AND EARLY EDUCATION CENTERS. OVER FIVE POINT SIX MILLION CHILDRENIN AMERICA HAVE FOOD ALLERGIES NEARLY 40% OF THESE CHILDREN HAVE EXPERIENCED A SEVERE ALLERGIC REACTION. AND MANY OF THESE REACTIONS HAPPENED ON SCHOOL CAMPUSES. IT IS CRUCIAL TO EMPHASIZE THAT FOOD ALLERGIES CAN BE LIFE THREATENING ANAPHYLAXIS IS A POTENTIALLY LETHAL ALLERGIC REACTION THAT CAN HAPPEN WITHIN MINUTES AND IF NOT PROPERLY TREATED. CAN BE FATAL. NO STUDENT SHOULD FEEL UNSAFE ON CAMPUS AND NO PARENT SHOULD HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT WHETHER THEIR CHILD SCHOOL IS AWARE OF ALL AVAILABLE RESOURCES AND BEST PRACTICES WHEN IT COMES TO FOOD ALLERGIES. THAT'S WHY I INTRODUCED THIS MEASURE AB TWO SIX FOUR ZERO WILL REQUIRE THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION TO CREATE AN ACCESSIBLE AND DIGITAL RESOURCE THAT WILL INCLUDE PRACTICAL INFORMATION PLANNING STEPS AND STRATEGIES FOR REDUCING ALLERGIC REACTIONS ON SCHOOL CAMPUSES AND EARLY EDUCATION CENTERS. IT WILL HELP ENSURE THAT CALIFORNIA PARENTS ARE AWARE OF THE STATE AND FEDERAL LAWS HOW TO INITIATE INDIVIDUALIZED FOOD ALLERGY MANAGEMENT AND PREVENTION PLANS HOW TO OBTAIN INGREDIENT LIST FROM SCHOOL FOOD SERVICE PROVIDERS AND MUCH MORE. TODAY TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL IS AKKI AND PRISCILLA HERNANDEZ. THANK YOU TO YOUR FIRST WITNESS.

IN OUR DOUBTS JUST KNOWING WHAT TO DO FOR A- I. FEEL SAFE INCLUDED AT SCHOOL. I WOULD I WOULD EITHER NOT FINDING GETTING EVERYBODY EVEN WORSE TRUST ME I KNOW. BUT THIS GUY WILL SHOW THAT OUR SCHOOL CARES AND JUST WANTS TO MAKE US FEEL INCLUDED. BUT THIS GUY WILL HELP US A LOT MORE. INITIAL ESPECIALLY HELP OUR DEL. THESE FEELINGS ARE IMPORTANT BECAUSE SOMETIMES YOU CAN'T YOU CAN'T PARTICIPATE IN SNACKS ALL THE ACTIVITIES I JUST HANG OUT WITH THE FRIENDS BECAUSE THEIR P. B. AND J. AND WHEN YOU DO HAVE A REACTION IT CAN BE SCARY. IT CAN ALSO BE. DIFFERENT AND MAKE YOU FEEL A LITTLE EMBARRASSED AND DON'T GET ME WRONG BEING DIFFERENT ISN'T BAD AT ALL. ACTUALLY IN FACT IN BEING IN THE CAN BE A GREAT THING. BUT SOMETIMES YOU JUST WANT TO BE. WITH YOUR FRIENDS STAY BEING AFRAID OF FOOD. CALIFORNIA'S A WONDERFUL STATE AND I THINK IT COULD AND WILL BE BETTER WITH AB TWENTY SIX FORTY HERE IN SACRAMENTO IN MAKING SURE THE KIDS WITH FOOD ALLERGIES IN SCHOOL HAD THE MOST PROPER AND DEDICATED INFORMATION POSSIBLE.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN BIRDS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY FIVE SIXTY FIVE HERE TODAY I WOULD LIKE TO BEGIN BY THANKING COMMITTEE STAFF FOR ALL OF THEIR HARD WORK ON THIS MEASURE AND ACCEPTING ALL OF THAT RECOMMENDED COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS LISTED ON THE ANALYSIS. MEMBERS AS WE ARE ALSO KEENLY AWARE SCIENCE AND MATH ARE KEYS TO ADDRESSING GLOBAL CHALLENGES AND FINDING SOLUTIONS FOR ISSUES LIKE CLIMATE CHANGE AND PROTECTING PUBLIC HEALTH CALIFORNIA HAS WILL- WORLD CLASS STANDARDS FOR SCIENCE AND MATH IN TWENTY SIXTEEN CALIFORNIA ADOPTED THE NEXT GENERATION SCIENCE STANDARDS AND CURRENTLY OUR STATE IS LOOKING AT A REVISED AND IMPROVED MATHEMATICS FRAMEWORK. NOW WE MUST INVEST IN SUPPORTING TEACHERS IMPLEMENTING WE KNOW THAT TOO MANY STUDENTS ARE NOT GETTING THE ACADEMIC INSTRUCTIONAL OPPORTUNITIES THEY NEED AND DESERVE. THIS LEADS TO INEQUITIES IN LEARNING OUTCOMES AND HAVE CONSEQUENCES FOR COLLEGE GOING RATES AND PROVIDE A PROFESSIONAL PERTINENTES FOR CALIFORNIA STUDENTS THE EXPERIENCE OF THE GLOVE COVERED NINETEEN HAVE OUR HAS REVEALED THESE INEQUITIES LIKE NEVER BEFORE AND NOW IS THE TIME TO INVEST IN OUR STUDENTS AND OUR TEACHERS. WE WANT AND NEED MORE STUDENTS TO BE PREPARED FOR HIGH PAYING AN IMPACTFUL STEM CAREERS AND WE WANT OUR TEACHERS TO HAVE OPPORTUNITIES FOR CONTINUED LEARNING AND PROFESSIONAL COLLABORATION TO SUPPORT GREAT GREAT TEACHING PRACTICES. THIS IS WHY I HAVE INTRODUCED AB TWENTY FIVE SIXTY FIVE WHICH WILL IMPROVE MATH AND SCIENCE INSTRUCTION BY INVESTING IN PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT FOR SCIENCE AND MATH TEACHERS AND TEACHER LEADERS THE APPROACH OF AB TWENTY FIVE SIXTY FIVE IS TO BUILD ON WHAT WE KNOW WORKS COMMUNITIES OF PRACTICE FOR LOCAL EDUCATORS TO COME TOGETHER AND FOR NETWORKS- FOR TEACHERS AND TEACHER LEADERS TO SHARE AND BUILD ON THEIR EXPERIENCES. I HAVE ALSO SUBMITTED A BUDGET REQUEST TO ENSURE THAT FUNDING WILL BE AVAILABLE TO MAKE THIS INVESTMENT POSSIBLE BY IMPROVING HOW WE TRAIN TEACHERS TO TEACH SCIENCE AND MATH WE CAN MAKE THESE COURSES MORE ACCESS TO OUR- STUDENT POPULATION. IT WILL ALSO HELP EDUCATORS LEARN HOW TO TEACH SCIENCE AND MATH IN WAYS THAT ENGAGE STUDENTS. AND I AM SO PLEASED TO SEE THAT THE COALITION IS WORKING TOGETHER TO ADVOCATE FOR A NEW BLUEPRINT FOR ACTION. FOR EQUITABLE SCIENCE AND MATH EDUCATION. THIS BLUEPRINT IS A GREAT PLAN THAT WILL SERVE CALIFORNIA STUDENTS WELL AND I APPLAUD YOUR ADVOCACY FOR THE CRITICAL IMPROVEMENTS- YOU ARE YOU ARE RECOMMENDING FOR STUDENTS AND EDUCATORS. TODAY I HAVE WITH ME BRIAN RIVAS SENIOR DIRECTOR OF POLICY AND GOVERNMENT RELATIONS FOR EDUCATIONAL. EDUCATION TRUST WEST AND PETE AARON PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF SCIENCE EDUCATORS TO SPEAK TO THE COMMITTEE IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS BRIAN RIVAS ON BEHALF OF THE EDUCATION TRUST WEST THANK YOU TO YOUR STAFF FOR WORKING WITH US ON THIS AND DEVELOPING COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS. UP WE CO SPONSORED THIS BECAUSE WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT ACHIEVEMENT LEVELS IN MATH AND SCIENCE AND MAYBE MRE THAN THAT WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT THAT MEANS FOR ACCESS TO COLLEGE. IN FOR OPPORTUNITIES LATER IN LIFE. IF I MAY. JUST WANT TO SHARE A COUPLE QUICK DATA POINTS FROM THE LATEST ACHIEVEMENT. ASSESSMENTS IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND GRANTED. THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION IS URGING CAUTION BECAUSE WE WERE IN A PANDEMIC AND FEWER STUDENTS TOOK THE TESTS. BUT NONETHELESS 34% OF STUDENTS IN MATH MATTER EXCEEDED STANDARDS AND ONLY ONE IN FIVE LOW INCOME STUDENTS. AND ONE IN FIVE LET NEXT STUDENTS MET OR EXCEEDED STANDARDS. IN SCIENCE IT WAS 29% IN ONLY ONE IN SIX OF LOW INCOME STUDENTS AND ONE OF ONE IN SIX OF LATIN X. STUDENTS. WE DO EQUITY AUDITS FOR LOCAL EDUCATIONAL ENTITY OR- AGENCIES WHICH IS A COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS TO HELP THEM IMPROVE POLICY AND PRACTICE FOR LOW INCOME STUDENTS AND STUDENTS OF COLOR. INFREQUENTLY THOSE ANALYSES YIELD THAT WHEN IT COMES TO COMPLETING A THROUGH G. MATH AND SCIENCE IS A STUMBLING BLOCK IT'S ONE OF THE- THREE OR FOUR SUBJECTS WITH THE LOWEST COMPLETION RATES. BEYOND THAT FOR THOSE WHO MAKE IT TO COLLEGE. CALCULUS CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS TEND TO BE GATEKEEPERS FOR STUDENTS TO HIGH PAYING TECHNICAL FIELDS IN THE STEM STEM FIELDS. AND SO STUDENTS WHO DON'T DO WELL IN MATH AND SCIENCE HAVING TROUBLE GETTING INTO COLLEGE AND THEN THEY HAVE LIMITED OPTIONS WHEN THEY GET THERE. WE DECIDED TO PARTNER WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF SCIENCE EDUCATORS BECAUSE- THEY KNOW WHAT WORKS BEST THEY KNOW WHAT IS NEEDED THEY HAVE FIRST HAND EXPERIENCE WITH THE LACK OF INVESTMENT IN THE STATE FRAMEWORK FOR SCIENCE. AND THE UNEVEN IMPLEMENTATION THAT RESULTED. THIS BILL PROPOSES AN INVESTMENT IN THE CALIFORNIA PARTNERSHIP FOR MATH AND SCIENCE EDUCATION AND THEN FUNDING FOR TEACHER AND SCHOOL SITE LEADERS. TO IMPROVE INSTRUCTION AND REALLY TURN AROUND WHAT WE'RE SEEING WHEN IT COMES TO STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT. WE URGE AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU. RIGHT RIGHT YES ALL RIGHT GOOD AFTERNOON ASSEMBLY MEMBER O'DONNELL AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS- CASE IS PLEASED TO SUPPORT AND CO SPONSOR AB TWENTY FIVE SIXTY FIVE BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER RUBIO WE THANK. ASSEMBLY MEMBER RUBIO FOR OFFERING IN CHAMPIONING THIS BILL WE ALSO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFFER WORKING US ON THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS- WE KNOW THAT IF YOU WANT TO CREATE MEANINGFUL CHANGE IN CLASSROOMS YOU NEED TO EMPOWER TEACHERS AS LEADERS THAT'S WHAT AB TWENTY FIVE SIXTY FIVE IS DESIGNED TO DO. REAL PROFESSIONAL RUN TAKES TIME IT INVOLVES PRACTICE IN THE CLASSROOM AND IT BUILDS TEACHER LEADERSHIP THAT LEADS TO LONG TERM CAPACITY AND EFFICACY. IN TWENTY FOURTEEN THE STATE ALLOCATED ONE A QUARTER BILLION DOLLARS INTO PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT TO SUPPORT COMMON CORE I GOT TO ATTEND SOME OF THOSE TRAININGS IT WAS FIVE DAYS IN A ROW IN A ROOM WITH A POWER POINT WITH THE PERSON WHO HAD JUST BEEN HIRED BY A PUBLISHER- THERE WAS NO ABILITY TO TRY THINGS OUT LEARN AND ADJUST THERE WAS NO LEADERSHIP CAPACITY BUILT AND IT HONESTLY DIDN'T LEAD TO MEANINGFUL CLASSROOM CHANGE. WHEN NDSS WAS ADOPTED ON THE OTHER HAND THERE WERE NO STATE FUNDS ALLOCATED TO SUPPORT IT BUT USING MONEY FROM FOUNDATIONS GROUPS LIKE CASE WORKED WITH COUNTY OFFICES CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION CALIFORNIA SCIENCE PROJECT K. TWELVE ALLIANCE CTA ADDRESSED WEST CHILDREN NOW AND OTHERS. WE WERE ABLE TO BUILD STATEWIDE LEADERSHIP AND LEARN HOW TO GROW TEACHERS INTO LEADERS AND HOW TO DESIGN PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT THAT RESPECTED THE REALITIES OF THE CLASSROOM WE LEARNED HOW TO MAKE SCIENCE LEARNING EQUITABLE. AND IMPACTFUL. CDA THE STATE BOARD AND SUCCESSFULLY CREATED THE CALIFORNIA PARTNERSHIP FOR MATH AND SCIENCE EDUCATION TO BRING ALL THESE GROUPS TOGETHER. AND WORK WITH DISTRICTS COUNTIES IN TEACHER LEADERS TO JOIN IN COMMUNITIES OF PRACTICE. THIS COMMUNITY IS A PRACTICE THAT THIS BILL SUPPORTS BUILDS EDUCATOR CAPACITIES TO ADVANCE ACCESS. TO MEANINGFUL MATH AND SCIENCE TEACHING AND LEARNING. AND PROMOTES RELATIONSHIP BUILDING CONNECTING PARTICIPANTS WITH EXPERTS AND RESEARCHERS AND SUPPORTING LEADERS. BUT AGAIN THIS WORK WAS PRIVATELY FUNDED WE DID GREAT WORK BUT IT WAS NEVER ENOUGH IN THE STATE IS BIGGEST CALIFORNIA. I DON'T NEED TO EXPLAIN TO THIS COMMITTEE WHY HIGH QUALITY EDUCATION SCIENCE AND MATH IS VITAL TO STUDENTS OF CALIFORNIA. OR WHY A WORK FORCE EDUCATED IN SCIENCE AND MATH IS A KEY TO CALIFORNIA'S FUTURE ECONOMIC VIABILITY. I'M AS AMENDMENT THIS MEASURE PROVIDES SUSTAINED OPPORTUNITIES FOR TEACHER LEADERSHIP AND PROFESSIONAL LEARNING. AND SUPPORTS THE INFRASTRUCTURE COMMUNITIES OF PRACTICE. FOR CLASSROOM TEACHERS AND SITE AND DISTRICT BASED TEAMS CASE SUPPORTS AB TWENTY FIVE SIXTY FIVE AND URGES A YES VOTE. THANK YOU OTHERS IN SUPPORT. MY NAME'S KELLY QUAN MARTIN I AM AN EDUCATOR AND THE ELK GROVE UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT WITH OVER SIXTEEN YEARS OF EXPERIENCE I'M A PARENT I AM A BOARD MEMBER WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF SCIENCE EDUCATORS I AM A TEACHER LEADER WITH THE CALIFORNIA SUBJECT MATTER PROJECTS AND I'M A FACULTY MEMBER WITH THE SCHOOL OF EDUCATION AT UC DAVIS AND THE COLLEGE OF EDUCATION AT SAC STATE.

THANK YOU WELL NOW MOVED FIVE ON THE FOURTEEN AGAIN BY MISS- RUBIO AB TWENTY SIX NINETY FOUR FILE ITEM FOURTEEN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN BIRDS I THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT NOW ASSEMBLY BELL TWENTY SIX NINETY FOUR TODAY I WOULD LIKE TO BEGIN BY THANKING COMMITTEE STAFF FOR ALL OF THEIR WORK ON THIS MEASURE AND BY ACCEPTING ALL OF THE RECOMMENDED COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS LISTED IN THE ANALYSIS. MEMBERS AS YOU ALL ARE WELL AWARE CALIFORNIA'S CURRENTLY FACING AN UNPRECEDENTED SHORTAGE OF TEACHERS WHICH HAS BEEN IT- EXASPERATED BY A- COURT COVERED NINETEEN PANDEMIC. AB TWENTY SIX NINETY FOUR WILL TACKLE THIS SHORTAGE BY PROVIDING FUNDING FOR TEACHER INDUCTION PROGRAMS IN CALIFORNIA. CALIFORNIA IS CURRENTLY FACING AND I'M PRESIDENT AND SHORTAGE OF TEACHERS WHICH- WE ALL KNOW IS CRITICAL TO THE LEARNING OF- STUDENTS AB TWENTY SIX NINETY FOUR TACKLE THIS RETARDED. BY PROVIDING FUNDING FOR TEACHER INDUCTION PROGRAMS IN CALIFORNIA. THE FINANCIAL BURDEN ON NEW TEACHERS WHO ARE REQUIRED TO OBTAIN A FOUR YEAR DEGREE IN A SPECIFIC SUBJECT AREA. AND ROLLING THEY TEACHING CREDENTIALING PROGRAM AND PARTICIPATE IN AND IN MANY INSTANCES PAID FOR BUT IT'S A PROGRAM. WE THIS REQUIREMENT NOT ONLY CREATES A DISTINCT A DISINCENTIVE FOR PROSPECTIVE TEACHERS TO ENTER THE PROFESSION BUT ALSO CONTRIBUTES TO THE HIGH NUMBER OF NEW TEACHERS LEAVING THE PROFESSION. THEREFORE IT IS IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE STATE AND ITS PEOPLE TO PROVIDE FUNDING. UP FOR INDUCTION PROGRAMMES AND PROHIBIT INDUCTION PROVIDERS FROM CHARGING YOU TEACH TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS STATE MANDATED PROGRAM. AB TWENTY SIX NINETY FOUR AND IT'S HAPPENING BUDGET REQUEST WILL ACCOMPLISH JUST THAT. THE BILL IS SPONSORED BY SUPERINTENDENT PUBLIC INSTRUCTION TONY THURMOND AND HAS NO KNOWN OPPOSITION. WITH ME TODAY WE HAVE THAT THE SUPERINTENDENT CHERYL COTTON TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN BIRDS OF THE CNVENTIONAL COTTON THAT THE SUPERINTENDENT OF THE INSTRUCTION MEASUREMENT ADMINISTRATION BRANCH OF THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. I HAVE WITH ME MONEY LIKE WAYNE OUR INTERIM DIRECTOR FOR IT THE EDUCATOR EXCELLENCE AND EUITY DIVISION I'M TESTIFYING ON BEHALF OF THE STATE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION TONY THURMOND. WHO IS A PROUD SPONSOR OF. AB TWO SIX NINE FOUR THE PANDEMIC HAS BROUGHT MANY RESIGNATIONS FROM TEACHERS WHICH HAS INTENSIFIED THE PERSISTENT. SHORTAGE TWO THIRDS OF CALIFORNIA DISTRICTS HAVE REPORTED HAVING MORE TEACHER VACANCIES AND DIFFICULTIES ATTRACTING NEW TEACHERS THIS YEAR. IF TRISH IS ESPECIALLY HIGH IN THE FIRST FEW YEARS OF TEACHING IN THE FIRST YEAR OF TEACHING. SEVERAL STUDIES HAVE ESTIMATED THAT BETWEEN 40% AND 50% OF NEW TEACHERS LEAVE. WITHIN THE FIRST FIVE YEARS OF ENTRY INTO TEACHING. THERE ARE MANY HURDLES TO BECOMING A TEACHER IN CALIFORNIA TRADITIONAL CREDENTIALING PROGRAMS FOR CANDIDATES IN CALIFORNIA INCLUDE AN ADDITIONAL TWO TO THREE SEMESTERS AFTER COMPLETING A BACHELOR'S DEGREE. TWO OF THE SEMESTERS MUST BE SPENT DOING UNPAID STUDENT TEACHING. FOR MANY THIS OPTION IS VERY CHALLENGING FROM A FISCAL STANDPOINT. AFTER COMPLETING THE CREDENTIAL PROGRAM NEW TEACHERS ARE FACED WITH ADDITIONAL COSTS RELATED TO REQUIRED ASSESSMENTS AND CREDENTIALING FEES. ONCE EXAMS AND FEES HAVE BEEN PAID BY THE BEGINNING TEACHER NEW TEACHERS MUST THEN CLEAR THEIR PRELIMINARY CREDENTIAL. THE CLEAR THEIR PRELIMINARY CREDENTIAL NEW TEACHERS ARE REQUIRED TO PARTICIPATE IN AN INDUCTION PROGRAM. THE TRADITIONAL TWO YEAR INDUCTION PROGRAM COST APPROXIMATELY FIVE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLARS. AB TWO SIX NINE FOUR WOULD REMOVE THE FINANCIAL BURDEN FOR THOUSANDS OF NEW TEACHERS IN NEED OF CLEARING THEIR PRELIMINARY CREDENTIAL. OR WHO STILL NEED TO COMPLETE THEIR TEACHING PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT AND OR THE READING INSTRUCTION COMPETENCE YES ASSESSMENT. THIS LEGISLATION IS A CRITICAL STEP TOWARD ADDRESSING THE FISCAL CHALLENGES THAT IMPACTS OUR TEACHER WORK FOR SHORT SHORTAGE IN CALIFORNIA. WORKING CLOSELY WITH CTC ON THIS BILL THANK YOU AGAIN- A SIMPLE ASSEMBLY MEMBER RUBIO FOR THIS IMPORTANT PIECE OF LEGISLATION AND TO THIS COMMITTEE I HOPE YOU CAN SUPPORT THIS IMPORTANT MEASURE.

JENNIFER DIETRICH WITH THE PARTNERSHIP FOR CHILDREN AND YOUTH AND GENEVIEVE. KERNS UPPER. WHICH SET UP THANK YOU YOUR WITNESSES DONNELLA MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS GENEVIEVE KONIG CHAU FAIR AND I'M SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF GENERATION THAT WE ARE A STUDENT LED ADVOCACY GROUP FOCUSED ON EDUCATIONAL EQUITY AND WE ARE PROUD CO SPONSORS OF AB TWO FIVE OH SEVEN. AT JOHN UP WE BELIEVE THAT ALL STUDENTS SHOULD HAVE EQUAL ACCESS TO OPPORTUNITIES FOR LEARNING AND FOR GROWTH. QUALITY AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAM PROVIDE A SAFE AND ENGAGING PLACE TO PROMOTE THE PHYSICAL SOCIAL EMOTIONAL AND ACADEMIC GROWTH OF STUDENTS OF ALL AGES. AND MANY OF THE BENEFITS OF AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS ARE ESPECIALLY IMPACTFUL FOR USE IN MIDDLE AND HIGH SCHOOL. AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS OFFER AVENUES TO COLLEGE AND THE WORKPLACE I PROVIDING STUDENTS WITH OPPORTUNITIES TO DEVELOP AND USE TECHNOLOGY. BY PROMOTING CROSS CULTURAL UNDERSTANDING COLLABORATIVE THINKING AND LEADERSHIP SKILLS. AND RESEARCH SHOWS THAT YOU TO PARTICIPATE IN AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS HAVE GREATER ACADEMIC SUCCESS CAREER PREPARATION AND SOCIAL EMOTIONAL DEVELOPMENT THAN THOSE WHO DO NOT PARTICIPATE. MIDDLE AND HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS WHO REGULARLY PARTICIPATE IN AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS ALSO REPORT GREATER SCHOOL CONNECTEDNESS ACADEMIC MOTIVATION AND CARING ADULTS RELATIONSHIPS. IS CRUCIAL BENEFITS KEEPING YOUTH ENGAGED IN SCHOOL WHICH IS MORE THAN EVER MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER IN THE WAKE OF COVERT NINETEEN WHICH RESULTED IN DRAMATIC DECREASES IN STUDENT ATTENDANCE AND ENGAGEMENT. JENNIFER PLOTS THE STATE'S MONUMENTAL INVESTMENTS IN UNIVERSAL AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS. UNIVERSAL AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS WILL PROMOTE EDUCATIONAL EQUITY LEVELING THE PLAYING FIELD FOR LOW INCOME STUDENTS WHO MAY NOT HAVE HAD ACCESS TO THE SAME AFTER SCHOOL ACTIVITIES ENRICHMENT AND ACADEMIC SUPPORT AS THEIR MORE AFFLUENT PEERS. HOWEVER THE ENTIRETY OF THE STATE'S PLAN FIVE BILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT IN UNIVERSAL AFTER SCHOOL IS PRIORITIZE FOR ELEMENTARY SCHOOL STUDENTS. CALIFORNIA'S MIDDLE AND HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS DESERVE TO HAVE A SAFE AND RICH IN PLACE AFTER SCHOOL HOURS WHERE THEY CAN DEVELOP SKILLS AND RELATIONSHIPS I WILL HELP THEM SUCCEED IN SCHOOL CAREER AND LIFE. BY PRIORITIZING A PORTION OF EXISTING AFTER SCHOOL FUNDING FOR STUDENTS IN MIDDLE AND HIGH SCHOOL AB TWO FIVE ZERO SEVEN WILL ENSURE THE OLDER YOUTH MAINTAIN ACCESS TO THESE BENEFICIAL PROGRAMS. AS THE STATE'S INVESTMENT IN UNIVERSAL AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS GROW. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. GOOD AFTERNOON JAN DIETRICH ON BEHALF OF THE PARTNERSHIP FOR CHILDREN AND YOUTH. THE PANDEMIC HAS INCREASED DEPRESSION ANXIETY AND STRESS AMONG STUDENTS LAST WEEK THE CDC WARNED OF ACCELERATING MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS AMONG ADOLESCENTS WITH MORE THAN FOUR IN TEN TEENS REPORTING THAT THEY FEEL QUOTE PERSISTENTLY SAD AND HOPELESS. AND ONE IN FIVE TEENS SAYING THEY'D KOMPLETT CONTEMPLATED SUICIDE. WE KNOW THAT STUDENT SUCCESS IN SCHOOL AND LIFE HINGES ON THE SUPPORT OF CARING AND EFFECTIVE ADULTS GETTING CALIFORNIA FOUR IN TEN HIGH SCHOOL FRESHMAN. CAN'T IDENTIFY A CARING RELATIONSHIP WITH AN ADULT ON CAMPUS. AS YOU ALL KNOW SCHOOL COMMUNITIES ARE ALSO STRUGGLING WITH A DRAMATIC DECREASE IN STUDENT ATTENDANCE AND ENGAGEMENT AFTERSCHOOL AND SUMMER LEARNING PROGRAMS BUILD RELATIONSHIPS AND CARE WITH CARING AND SUPPORTIVE ADULTS PROVIDE SAFE SPACES WHERE STUDENTS CAN BUILD CONFIDENCE AND FEEL A SENSE OF BELONGING. IN CONNECTS COOLS FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES. IRAN'S ALSO PROVIDE ACADEMIC AND VOCATIONAL AND RECREATIONAL ACTIVITIES TO HELP KEEP YOU INVESTED AND GROWING AND AS THEY'VE ALREADY SAID THE RESEARCH SHOWS. YOU KNOW INCREASE IN ATTENDANCE MORE LIKELY TO GRADUATE HIGH SCHOOL LOWER RATES OF SUSPENSION AND EXPULSIONS LESS LIKELY TO BECOMING INVOLVED IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE. THERE IS AN URGENT NEED TO INCREASE EQUITABLE ACCESS TO THESE PROGRAMS THAN ADOLESCENTS ARE CURRENTLY BEING LEFT OUT DUE TO THE LACK OF FUNDING ONLY 25% OF HIGH SCHOOLS IN CALIFORNIA HAVE PUBLIC FUNDING FOR AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS. AND AS ALREADY STATED THE STATE'S FIVE BILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT IN EXPANDING AFTER SCHOOL AND SUMMER PROGRAMS LEAVES OUT MIDDLE AND HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS NOT A PENNY IS PRIDE PRIORITIZED FOR THEM. AB TWENTY FIVE OH SEVEN PRIORITIZES FEDERAL AFTER SCHOOL FUNDING FOR HIGH SCHOOL MIDDLE SCHOOL YOUTH IN FUTURE GRANT COHORTS AND ENSURES THAT THE CURRENT LEVEL OF STATE FUNDING FOR MIDDLE. FOR MIDDLE SCHOOL YOUTH CANNOT BE REDUCING FUTURE COHORTS. LIKE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL MIDDLE AND HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS NEED ACCESS TO THE SAFE PLACES TO BUILD THOSE SKILLS AND THOSE CRITICAL RELATIONSHIPS AT SCHOOL SO THEY CAN SUCCEED IN SCHOOL LIFE AND CAREER.
