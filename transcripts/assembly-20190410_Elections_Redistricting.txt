THE ASSEMBLY RULES COMMITTEE RECENTLY REVISED THE COMMITTEE REFERRAL ON THAT BILL AS A RESULT IF THAT BILLS APPROVED BY THIS COMMITTEE TODAY IT WILL BE RE REFER TO THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT COMMITTEE.

BEFORE I BEGIN I WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR THEIR WORK ON THIS BILL I IN THAT THERE ARE SOME WRINKLES TO IRON OUT AND I COMMIT TO WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEE TO ADDRESS. THE ISSUES AS THE BILL MORE MOVES FORWARD. I'M HERE 2% AB THIRTEEN OH SIX MY BILL TO GIVE THE FAIR POLITICAL PRACTICES COMMITTEE. THE AUTHORITY TO IMPOSE AN ADMINISTRATIVE OR CIVIL PENALTY AGAINST A PERSON FOR MISUSE OF PUBLIC RESOURCES. FOR CAMPAIGN ACTIVITY. I'M SURE EVERYONE ON THE COMMITTEE IS FAMILIAR WITH THE RECENT ARTICLES REGARDING THE USE OF FUNDS BY BAR IN SUPPORT OF BALLOT MEASURES. HOWEVER WE KNOW THERE HAVE BEEN OTHER INTO INSTANT SAYS THAT PART WHICH IS THE MOST EGREGIOUS. I INTO THIS THIS BILL BECAUSE SOME OF FOUR O'CLOCK CLARIFICATION ABOUT HOW OFFICIALS AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE EXPECTED TO BEHAVE. LÃ  MEASURES ARE PUT ON THE BALLOT IF NEEDED. THE ABILITY TO IMPOSE HAVE IMPLICATIONS FOR WHEN THOSE RULES ARE BROKEN IS ALSO NEEDED. THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT UNLESS THERE ARE REAL DETERRENCE WHAT WHAT PENALTIES THAT BBC CAN IMPOSE IN THESE INSTANCES I SIMPLY CHEST THE COST OF DOING BUSINESS. ULTIMATELY WHAT I'M ASKING FOR IS THAT ANYTHING THAT EACH OF US OR OUR STAFF HAVE TO ABIDE BY. HERE WITH ME TODAY IS. HI PHILLIP ON ON BEHALF OF THE F. A. B. C. AS WELL AS DAVID BAINBRIDGE AT B. B. C.'S COUNCIL TO HELP ANSWER ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS. THANK YOU -- MISS OR MISTER CRT INTRODUCED US YES. NO. IS IT EASY ENOUGH. ANY ADDITIONAL INNOCENT SUPPORT. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. AND ITS WINNERS. BRING IT BACK TO COLLEAGUES QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. YEAH THIS REALLY QUICKLY I WANNA SAYS SUPPORT THIS BILL -- THE I THINK THERE'S A VERY MUCH. I MEAN IT'S ALREADY LAW BUT THE THE NEED TO HAVE THIS SEPARATION THIS VERY CLEAR SEPARATION BETWEEN. YOU KNOW GOVERNMENT BODIES THERE I'VE SEE DOING THEIR WORK BUT THEN WHEN. YOU KNOW MAYBE THEY WANT TO SEE A MEASURE PASS. THEY CAN'T BEGINNING INVOLVED ON THAT CAMPAIGN SIDE THEY CAN'T BE USING PUBLIC RESOURCES IN PUBLIC. AND WE'VE SEEN THAT THAT ONE IS GOTTEN VERY BLURRED IN MANY DIFFERENT CASES SO I THINK HAVING THIS ADDITIONAL TOOL. IN PLACE THAT GIVES THAT THE PC THAT. HE HAS SOME TEETH TO REALLY ENFORCE THAT IS A MUCH NEEDED THINGS ALL THE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY THANK YOU GREAT. WHICH ARTICLES. YES BEFORE -- I WANTED NICK ASSEMBLY MEMBER MELENDEZ TO INTRODUCE A SIMILAR MEASURE BUT HAS AGREED TO JOIN AUTHOR THIS -- INSTEAD AND SO WE HAVE A BIPARTISAN ISSUE I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEE AND WE HAVE SOME STUFF TO WORK ON IT YOU HAVE MY COMMITMENT TO FIND A GOOD PLACE TO LAND. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN I. BUT WHEN YOU HAVE A QUORUM PERFECT I APPRECIATE IT AS SOON AS WE GET TO A QUORUM -- I WILL BE RECOMMENDING AN AYE VOTE AS DETAILED IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSISTHEIR NUMBER OF STATE LAWS THAT PROHIBIT THE USE OF PUBLIC RESOURCES FOR CAMPAIGN ACTIVITIES. BUT THERE HAVE BEEN RELATIVELY FEW PROSECUTIONS FOR VIOLATIONS OF THOSE LAWS. AS THE AUTHORS MENTION THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS LAYS OUT A COUPLE OF CONCERNS WITH THE APPROACH THAT THE CURRENT VERSION OF THE BILL TAKES. IN TRYING TO ADDRESS THAT ISSUE ADDITIONALLY THE LACK OF CLEAR STANDARDS ABOUT WHAT CONSTITUTES A PROHIBITED CAMPAIGN ACTIVITY BY GOVERNMENT AGENCIES PRESENTS CHALLENGES TO COMPLIANCE WITH THE LAW. BUT I KNOW THAT THIS BILL WILL BENEFIT FROM FURTHER DISCUSSIONS ABOUT HOW -- IT CAN BE REFINED -- AND IN WITH THE OTHERS COMMITMENT THAT SHE'S GRISLY GIVEN WILL CONTINUE THOSE DISCUSSIONS AND I'M PREPARED TO SUPPORT THE BILL AS SOON AS WE GET A QUORUM THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU. OKAY MOVING ON I THINK WE'VE GOT ASSEMBLY MEMBER QUIRK SILVA. WITH -- AB SIX TWENTY SIX ITEM NUMBER. SEVEN NUMBER A GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS AND I AND THANK YOU THE EARLY BIRD GETS THE WORM THIS MORNING HANG TIME HERE EARLY SO I GET TO PRESENT THE HEAD. ANY HOW. I AM GOING TO BE PRESENTING AB SIX TWENTY SIX I'D LIKE. TO LET YOU KNOW THAT MY TESTIMONY IS A LITTLE BIT LONGER THAN USUAL BECAUSE WE'RE REALLY TRYING. TO MAKE SURE THE NUANCES OF THIS BILL ARE TOLD. AB SIX TWENTY SIX WOULD CLARIFY IN EXISTING CONFLICT OF IN INTERESTS A STATUE GOVERNMENT CODE. TEN NINETY THAT A DESIGN PROFESSIONAL PERFORM PERFORMING WORK ON ONE PORTION OUR FATE PHASE OF A PUBLIC WORKS PROJECT DOES NOT AUTOMATICALLY DISQUALIFY THAT SAME DESIGN PROFESSIONAL FROM PERFORMING WORK ON IT LATER PORTION OR PHASE OF THAT SAME. PROJECT AND I'LL JUST JUMP IN HERE THAT COMING FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENT -- AND ALSO ON SOME OF OUR MAJOR -- BOARDS FROM SANITATION TO SKAGGS -- THIS REALLY PERTAINS TO SOME OF THESE BIG PROJECTS WERE TALKING ABOUT BECAUSE OF AMBIGUITY IN THE LAW THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT IS TAKING PLACE TODAY. NUMBER ONE PUBLIC AGENCY CITIES COUNTY SPECIAL DISTRICTS ARE BEING PRECLUDED FROM CONTRACTING WITH THE DESIGN PROFESSIONALS ON MORE THAN ONE PORTION OF THE PROJECT. EVEN IF THAT ENGINEER OR ARCHITECT OR LAND SURVEYOR IS THE BEST MOST QUALIFIED PROFESSIONAL FOR THE PART OF THE PROJECT AS WELL. NUMBER TWO PUBLIC AGENCIES ARE ALREADY REQUIRED UNDER STATE AND FEDERAL STATUE TO CONTRACT WITH THESE DESIGN PROFESSIONALS ON THE BASIS OF QUALIFICATIONS. BASED TO SELECTIONS QB US MEANING THAT THE ENGINEERS OR ARCHITECTS ARE COMPETITIVELY SELECTED ACCORDING TO HOMEOWNERS EVER IS MOST QUALIFIED FOR THE JOB AT HAND. LEGISLATION WAS PASSED THROUGH THIS COMMITTEE IN TWENTY THIRTEEN AND TWENTY FOURTEEN WHICH COLLECTIVELY SET THE STAGE FOR THE SITUATION THAT WE ARE IN TWO DAY ESTABLISHING THAT THE F. P. C. C. WITH AUTHORIZED TO ISSUE OPINIONS ON WHETHER OR NOT A CONFLICT EXISTED. AND A CONTRACT WITH A LOCAL AGENCY. NUMBER TO ANYONE WHO AIDS OR A BET OR CAUSES A CONFLICT TO OCCUR CAN BE HELD PERSONAL UP PERSONALLY LIABLE TO SUBJECT TO F. PCC. ADMIN ACTION CIVIL FINES AND POTENTIALLY JAIL TIME. GOVERNMENT CODE TEN NINETY WAS WRITTEN AND INTENDED FOR THE SITUATION OF CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS ARE PUBLIC OFFICIALS OR THE LIKE WHO HOLD A FINANCIAL INTEREST. IN ANY ENTITY ATTEMPTING TO CONTRACT WITH THE CITY OR PUBLIC AGENCY FOR WHICH THE PUBLIC OFFICIAL IS THE DECISION MAKER. WITH THE LEGISLATOR WHICH WITH THE WHAT THE LEGISLATURE COULDN'T HAVE KNOWN AT THAT TIME IS THAT A LATER COURT CASE WOULD EXTEND THOSE PROVISIONS THAT A CONTRACTOR OR DESIGN PROFESSIONAL COULD BE SUBJECT. TO TEN NINETY ESSENTIALLY WHAT THE SERIES OF THE EVENTS HAVE DONE IS TURN THE F. T. C. C. INTO A DE FACTO ARBITER. ON POTENTIALLY EVERY LOCAL AGENCY PUBLIC WORKS CONTRACTS A ROLE THEY ARE NOT [inaudible] FIT. FOR LACKING CLARITY IN THE LOT MANY PUBLIC AGENCIES HAVE SIMPLY ELECTED TO DOES THE LAW DOES ALLOW FOLLOW ON CONTRACTS WITH DESIGN PROFESSIONALS SINCE THE RISK OF GETTING IT WRONG IS TOO GREAT. AND AGAIN THIS GOES BACK TO SOME OF MY LOCAL COUNCIL DAYS AND SOME OF MY A REGIONAL BOARDS. WITH THAT DECISION YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT QUITE A BIT OF EXPERTISE AND ALSO DOLLARS -- AS PROJECTS -- THE PRICES ESCALATE WITH CHANGEOVERS AND SO FORTH SO THIS IS REALLY. VERY SPECIFIC WHEN YOU COME OUT TO THESE TYPE OF LARGE CONTRACTS IF THIS LEGISLATION PASSES THEY WILL STILL RETAIN THAT RIGHT TO REQUIRE FURTHER CONTRACT RESTRICTIONS OR DISALLOW CONTRACTS FOR ANY REASON SO. THAT THEY DESIRE AB SIX TWENTY SIX MERELY SEEKS TO RESTORE SOME OF THE CLARITY TO PUBLIC AGENCIES THAT A DESIGN PROFIT PROFESSIONAL IS NOT AUTOMATICALLY INCLUDED FROM PARTICIPATING IN SUBSEQUENT PHASES. OF WORK IF THEY HAD ANY INVOLVEMENT IN THE EARLIER PHASE ULTIMATELY THE PUBLIC DESERVES THE BEST SAFEST AND MOST COST EFFECTIVE PUBLIC WORKS PROJECT. IT IS IN THE PUBLIC WHO IT IS THE PUBLIC -- SUFFERS WHEN THEY'RE PROJECTS ARE NOT ABLE TO BE DESIGNED BY THE BEST MOST QUALIFIED PROFESSIONALS. OUT WITH THAT TODAY HAVE WITH ME JOHN MOFFITT ON BEHALF OF A C. E. C. CALIFORNIA AND MIKE BELOW OFFER A I A CALIFORNIA IN SUPPORT. GREAT. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE JOHN MOFFITT ON BEHALF OF THE AMERICAN COUNCIL OF ENGINEERING COMPANIES I THINK THE AUTHOR -- OUTLINED SORT OF THE SERIES OF EVENTS THAT GOT US TO WHERE WE ARE TODAY -- IF YOU KNOW THE THE TWENTY THIRTEEN BILL ALLOWING THE F. PPC TO GIVE OPINIONS AND ALSO IN FORCE. TEN NINETY THE THE FOLLOW A BILL -- IMPOSING AIDING AND ABETTING LIABILITY ON AND CITY LOCAL GOVERNMENT -- EMPLOYEES AND THEN THIS TWENTY SEVENTEEN APPELLATE COURT HEARING DAVIS BE FRESNO UNIFIED WHICH WAS AN INTERESTING CASE BECAUSE THE LOWER COURT DISMISSED. A NUMBER OF CAUSES OF ACTION FRAUDULENT ACTIVITY IT'S AT TRADE CENTER ONE OF THOSE CAUSES WAS CONFLICT OF INTEREST. IN THE LOWER COURT DISMISSED IT SAID NO. THE CONTRACTOR IS NOT AN OFFICER OR EMPLOYEE FOR THE PURPOSES OF GOVERNMENT CODE SECTION TEN NINE TEN NINETY ONLY APPLIES TO OFFICERS AND EMPLOYEES. IN THE SITUATION WHERE THERE'S A KH CONTRACT AN UNDUE INFLUENCE HE WENT TO THE APPELLATE COURT IN THE APPELLATE COURT. REINSTATED SAID THE LOWER COURT GOT IT WRONG IN A COUPLE OF THOSE FRAUD ISSUES. BUT THEN ALSO WITH RESPECT TO TEN NINETY THE LOWER COURT REMEMBER. THIS CASE WAS ABOUT A CONTRACTOR NOT AN ENGINEERING FIRM NOT AN ARCHITECTURAL FIRM BUT A CONTRACTOR. WHO IS BUILDING A SCHOOL THEN LEASING IT BACK TO FRESNO UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT? AND THE THE APPELLATE COURT BASICALLY SAID WELL LOOK. YOU KNOW YOU SHOULD LOOK INTO THIS YOU SHOULDN'T JUST DISMISS THIS CLAIM THAT THEY MIGHT. BE AN OFFICER OR EMPLOYEE OF THE YOU KNOW OF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT ENTITY. AND AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT WHAT THEY SAID WAS WHETHER DAVIS WILL BE ABLE TO PROVE CONTRACTOR VIOLATED THE CONFLICT OF INTEREST INTEREST PROVISION OF GOVERNMENT CODE SECTION. TEN TEN NINETY WILL DEPEND UPON THE FACTS ESTABLISHED BY THE EVIDENCE. IT IN SIX CONTRACTOR WAS SAID THEY MIGHT BE. AND BUT WHAT THAT DID IS THAT PUT US IN THE SITUATION THAT WE ARE TODAY BECAUSE AS WE STARTED TO SEE CONTRACTS IN OTHER JURISDICTIONS START TO MOVE THROUGH. YOU'VE GOT CITY ATTORNEY'S PUBLIC WORKS DIRECTORS AND OTHERS WHO ARE SAYING HEY LOOK I LIKE THESE ENGINEERS AND ARCHITECTS BUT I'M NOT GOING TO JAIL FOR ANYBODY. SO THEY'RE EITHER SAYING HEY SORRY YOU GUYS ARE OUT BECAUSE WE JUST DON'T WANT TO DEAL WITH THIS ISSUE. OR THEY'RE SAYING LET'S GO TO THE F. PPC AND GET AN OPINION. AND SO WHAT OUR FIRMS ARE DOING IS THEY'RE SAYING OKAY WE'RE NOT GOING TO BID ON THE EARLY PHASES AND SO -- WHAT WE'D LIKE TO DO IN THIS BILL IT DOES NOT SAY ANYBODY GETS A FUTURE CONTRACT IT JUST AS A MATTER OF LAW? THE FACT THAT YOU WERE IN PRE DESIGN SERVICES DOES NOT PRECLUDE YOU UNDER PROP CONFLICT OF INTEREST FROM JUST BIDDING ON FUTURE PHASES. WE SUPPORT THE BILL AND ASK FOR AYE BOAT GREAT AND IF I CAN IN. THE BEGINNING OR FOR ONE SECOND I'M GONNA TAKE THIS MOMENT TO ESTABLISH A QUORUM BEFORE LOSE IT -- SERVE MADAM SECRETARY COULD YOU PLEASE CALL THE ROLL BERMAN I ARE HERE BERMAN HERE GALLAGHER. GALLAGHER HERE CALDERON LOW. SO HERE MAYES. MAYES HERE MULLIN WEBER. WITH QUORUM GREAT REFORM SORRY FOR THE INTERRUPTION. IT'S YOUR TURN MEMBERS MIKE BULLARD ON BEHALF OF THE AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF ARCHITECTS CALIFORNIA COUNCIL OF FIRST OF ALL WITHOUT ATTEMPTING TO BETTER ANYBODY UP THAT THE ANALYSIS. WAS REALLY GOOD AT POINTING OUT. THAT THE QUESTIONS HERE THERE'S NOTHING INTUITIVE ABOUT SECTION TEN NINETY AND HOW THIS KICKS IN. IT'S AN IMPENETRABLE STATUTE AND I THOUGHT IT LAID OUT YOU KNOW IF YOU'VE READ IT YOU UNDERSTOOD THE PROBLEM HERE -- THE PROBLEM IS WE HAVE A STATUTE. WHY WOULD ARCHITECTS BE IN THE ELECTIONS COMMITTEE YEAH AND WHY WOULD THEY BE IMPACTED BY A CONFLICT OF INTEREST ON PUBLIC OFFICIALS? BUT THE PROBLEM IS SEVERE BECAUSE THE CONSEQUENCES OF VIOLATING THE STATUTE ARE SO SEVERE AND IT IS BECOMING AN ARTICLE OF FAITH AMONG THE ARCHITECTS WE TALKED. TO DON'T GET INVOLVED IN IT THE EARLY PHASES OF A CONTRACT YOU MAY BE DISQUALIFIED FROM THE BIG PART PORTIONS OF THE CONTRACT WHICH COME LATER. AND SO THE THE BILL IS ATTEMPTING TO GET THE BEST PEOPLE IN EARLY TO GIVE THE NEEDS ASSESSMENT THE EARLY CONSULTATION THAT THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT NEEDS. YOU SHOULD ALSO KNOW THAT WE BELIEVE THIS BILL IS CONSISTENT WITH HOW STATE CONTRACTING IS DONE UC AND CSU SO THIS ISN'T A RADICAL CONCEPT AT ALL IT IS A CLARIFICATION -- THERE HAVE BEEN ARGUMENTS MADE IT YOU KNOW I'VE LOOKED AT IT UP AND DOWN AND I DON'T SEE THE LIABILITY ISSUE FOR EXAMPLE THE THE QUESTION AROSE IS THIS RELATE TO APPORTIONMENT OF LIABILITY WE BELIEVE THAT. APPORTIONMENT OF LIABILITY IN THE EVENT OF MALPRACTICE WILL. HAPPEN EXACTLY AS IT DOES NOW A WITH OR WITHOUT THIS BILL WHAT THIS BILL WILL DO IS. A COMMONSENSE READING OF TEN NINETY SUGGEST JUST BECAUSE YOU WERE INVOLVED IN THE EARLY STAGES OF THE CONTRACT YOU SHOULD NOT BE AUTOMATICALLY DISQUALIFIED FROM LATER WORK. AND FOR THAT WE THINK THE IT'S GOOD FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT IT'S GOOD FOR CONTRACTING -- AND WE SUPPORT THE BILL THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. CHRIS CON REPRESENT THE COACHELLA VALLEY WATER DISTRICT IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. MISTER CHAIR MEMBER SCOTT GOVERNOR ON BEHALF OF THE CONSTRUCTION EMPLOYERS ASSOCIATION WE ARE THE LARGEST. UNIONIZED GENERAL CONTRACTORS IN THE STATE THE FRESNO CASE ACTUALLY INVOLVED ONE OF OUR MEMBERS -- IT IS INTERESTING THAT THIS BILL IS IN ELECTIONS BECAUSE IT'S KIND OF A CONVERGENCE OF ELECTIONS AND PUBLIC CONTRACTING. WHICH IS REALLY WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE. TO THE EXTENT THIS BILL IS SIMPLY. CLOSING THE LOOPHOLE. WHY IS IT ONLY LIMITED TO DESIGN PROFESSIONALS RIDE WHY NOT CONTRACTORS ONE OUT EVERY FORM OF PROCUREMENT? THE REASON IS IT IS AND SHOULD BE A CONFLICT WHAT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT IS HOW WHAT WILL WORK IN. THE REAL WORLD. A DESIGN PROFESSIONAL WILL GET A PRECONSTRUCTION. AGREEMENT SO THEY WILL ASSIST THE AGENCY IN DEVELOPING THE PLAN FOR CONSTRUCTION. THEY COULD THEORETICALLY. ALTER THAT PLAN TO CREATE -- AND I'M LEVEL PLAYING FIELD AS IT RELATES TO THE BIDDING FOR THE DESIGN WORK. AS THE DESIGNER THEY COULD THEN TELL THE PUBLIC AGENCY THAT THEY ARE THE ONES WHO SHOULD BE HIRED AS THE CONSTRUCTION MANAGER. SO TO THE EXTENT CONSTRUCTED BILLET THE ISSUES ARISE ISN'T AS THE LIABILITY MR BLOOD WAS REFERRING. TO THE ONLY WAY AN AGENCY. COULD PROTECT THEMSELVES IS GONE RIGHT THERE IS NO OBJECTIVE VOICE THE CONSTRUCTION MANAGER WOULD HAVE TO BLAME THEMSELVES FOR DESIGN FLAWS. AND CAN YOU IMAGINE THAT. WE SCREW THIS UP SO WE'RE GOING TO BE ON THE HOOK IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN INSTEAD IS THEY'RE GOING TO BLAME THE LICENSE CONTRACTORS AND SAY WELL THEY DID. THEIR RESPONSIBILITY THE PUBLIC AGENCIES THE TAXPAYERS WILL HAVE NO OBJECTIVE VOICE IN THE PROCESS THIS IS WHY. IT IS A CONFLICT THAT'S WHY MY MEMBERS ARE CLAMORING. TO KIND OF PERMIT THIS PRACTICE BUT TO THE EXTENT YOU WANT PER MINUTE WRECK YOU KNOW RECOGNIZE THE AGENCIES ARE LOSING OBJECTIVITY THEY ARE ALLOWED AND ONE PARTY. TO RIG EACH BID TO AWARD TO THEMSELVES AND WHAT PROBLEMS ARISE. THERE'S NO ONE THERE SO WE THINK THIS IS BAD POLICY IT'S REMAIN A CONFLICT -- BUT IF THE GOAL OF THIS COMMITTEE IS TO OPEN IT UP TO EVERYONE THEN DO JUST THAT ALLOW EVERYONE WHO PRIDES PRE CONSULTING SERVICES NOT ANY PROJECT. ON ANY TYPE OF CONTRACT TO DO IT. WE DON'T THINK IT'S GOOD POLICY BUT IF YOU WANT TO HAVE A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD THAT'S WHAT YOU SHOULD DO THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR TAUGHT BLOOM STEIN FOR THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA CONTRACTORS ASSOCIATION THIS IS A DANGEROUS MEASURE WE ASK FOR AN OVER. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS CHRIS WALKER BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA SHEET METAL AIR CONDITIONING CONTRACTORS ASSOCIATION A WE TO WERE OPPOSED TO AFTER THE CONFLICT REASONS STATED BY MR GOVERNOR -- IF IT'S IF IT'S CONFLICT FOR US IT'S A CONFLICT FOR THE ARCHITECTS THANK YOU THANK YOU. ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION SEEING NONE AT BRING BACK TO COLLEGE QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS MISTER MESS. WHAT'S THE THE TALK ABOUT THOSE -- THOSE THOSE TWO THINGS -- WHAT IS IT A CONFLICT OF IT DOES CONTINUE TO BE A CONFLICT OF INTEREST AND IT ISN'T THAN -- THAT AND BE AS SPECIFIC AS YOU CAN AS AS WHITE ISN'T. IT IT. I THINK THE ANALYSIS POINTS OUT WELL THAT WHEN THE F. PPC IS THE HAS BEEN BROUGHT THESE CASES IN THE VAST MAJORITY OF THEM THEY FOUND THAT NO CONFLICT EXISTS. TO TO MISTER GOVERNOR'S POINT TO BE PERFECTLY BLUNT IF I WAS THEM I WOULD BE WORRIED ABOUT THIS FRESNO V. UNIFIED RULING AND ITS APPLICATION TO CONTRACTORS FEW IN THE FUTURE. THAT WAS A CASE ABOUT A CONTRACTOR. AND WE DON'T DISAGREE THAT WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT WHEN YOU HAVE FACED PROJECTS. THAT ARE COMPETITIVELY BID USING QUALIFIED BASED SELECTION WHICH IS THE LAW. WHICH IS THE MOST QUALIFIED ENTITY OR FIRM SHOULD GET THE NEXT PHASE OF THIS PROJECT. AND ITS BID EVERY SINGLE STEP OF THE WAY. WE BELIEVE IT SHOULDN'T BE A CONFLICT FOR THEM EITHER YOU KNOW THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO TO TO BE A PART OF THE EARLY CONSTRUCTION PART OF THE PROJECT. AND THEN GET FUTURE PHASES THAT PROJECT TO IF THEY'RE THE BEST FOR HIM FOR THAT. AND AND I AGREE I THINK THIS THIS CASE -- AND THE HESITANCY ON BEHALF OF LOCAL PUBLIC ENTITIES IS CATCHING UP US TO US NOW BECAUSE WE ARE ON THE FRONT END. OF PROJECTS PRE DESIGN EARLY DESIGN STRUCTURAL DESIGN AS PROJECTS MOVE ALONG THEY'RE GOING TO GET IN THE CONSTRUCTION PHASES AND SO I I DON'T DISAGREE WE DON'T BELIEVE IT'S A CONFLICT FOR US WE DON'T BELIEVE IT'S A CONFLICT FOR THEM. AS LONG AS QPS IS FOLLOWED WHICH IS STATE STATUTE AND AS LONG AS EACH PHASES COMPETITIVELY BID WITH THE INFORMATION PUT OUT THERE SO THAT. BIDDERS ON EACH PHASE THE PROJECT CAN SEE THE WORK THAT WAS DONE BEFORE. DO YOU HAVE ANY DATA AT ALL BUT BEFORE THERE'S THIS CHILLING EFFECT OCCURRED -- THOSE WHO DID THE PRE DESIGN WORK -- HOW MANY OF THOSE FIRMS ENDED UP GETTING THAT THE CONTRACT OR WAS IT IS OR ANY? ANY DATA ON THAT AT ALL I DON'T I DON'T HAVE ANY PRE DATE ON THAT BUT I CAN GIVE YOU A MORE RECENT EXAMPLE ONE OF OUR ENGINEERING FIRMS HAD DID SOME PRE DESIGN WORK FOR A WATER DISTRICT IN SAN LUIS OBISPO. THEY DID THE PRE DESIGN WORK. THE THE WATER DISTRICT GOT THAT WORK BACK PUT THE NEXT PHASE OUT FOR AN RFP. THE ENGINEERING FIRM WANTED TO BID ON THAT. TOO THE WATER DISTRICT ASKED THE F. PPC FOR AN OPINION THE F. PPC SAID THERE MAY BE A CONFLICT HERE YOU NEED TO GATHER MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THAT PRE WORK. THE WATER DISTRICT DID THAT FELT COMFORTABLE THAT THERE WASN'T A CONFLICT. PUT IT OUT THAT ENGINEERING FIRM BID ON THAT CONTRACT DIDN'T GET IT. BECAUSE THEY WERE NOT THE MOST QUALIFIED BIDDER FOR THAT NEXT PHASE AND SO TO SUGGEST THAT SOMEHOW. THESE THINGS CAN ALWAYS BE SKEWED IN THE FAVOR OF THE OF THE FIRM THAT DID THE EARLIER -- THE EARLIER WORK IT'S JUST FALLS IT DOESN'T ALWAYS OCCUR THAT WAY SOMETIMES AND EVEN THE F. PPC. POINTED OUT THEIR MOST RECENT OPINION SOMETIMES THERE'S A GOOD PUBLIC POLICY REASON. FOR THE SAME FIRM TO BE DOING YOU KNOW DIFFERENT PHASES OF WORK AND THAT'S OKAY THAT IS NOT A CONFLICT. MICHELLE I'M GONNA MOVE THE BILL TODAY -- BUT I THINK THERE'S PROBABLY NEED TO BE SOME ASSURANCES. ON THIS BUT I CAN'T IMAGINE THAT THE AUTHOR -- BUT WOULD WOULD BRING FOR THE BILL -- THAT IS GOING TO ALLOW FOR A FOR INCREASED CONFLICTS OF INTEREST AND I'M A I WOULD IMAGINE THAT THE AUTHORS GONNA CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION TO MAKE SURE. OF THAT WOULD THAT WE GET SOME CLARIFICATION OF CLARIFICATIONS NEEDED SOME OF THE BILL. THANK YOU IN MOTION THE SECOND BY SIR GALLAGHER. YES SO I MEAN HEY LOOK IN THIS OVER IT'S IT'S REALLY NOT I THINK IT IS A PRETTY COMPLEX ISSUE. AND I GUESS. MY UNDERSTAND WHAT THIS BILL WOULD DO AT LEAST IN CURRENT FORM IS SORT OF PROVIDE A BLANKET EXEMPTION. FOR CERTAIN DESIGN PROFESSIONALS ARCHITECTS. AND SAY THERE IS NO CONFLICT OF INTEREST IS THAT CORRECT. WELL I WAS GOING TO ADD HERE IS ON AND I AM VERY MUCH WILLING TO SIT DOWN AND TALK TO THEM SOME OF THE OPPOSITION. BUT IN THIS CASE WERE SPEAKING JUST ABOUT THE ARCHITECTS BUT THAT DOESN'T PRECLUDE THAT WE COULDN'T GO BACK AND LOOK AT OTHER -- ENTITIES I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS IS TO MAKE THE ASSUMPTION IS THAT JUST BECAUSE SOMEBODY HAS WORKED ON THE DESIGN PHASE THAT ACT AUTOMATICALLY MEANS THEY'RE GOING TO GO TO THE NEXT PHASES I MEAN LIKE I SAID I'VE BEEN ON SOME OF THE REGIONAL BOARD SANITATION. THAT HAS HUGE CONTRACTS AND THAT IS NOT ALWAYS THE CASE THE OPPOSITE OF IT IS ALSO THE REVERSE WHERE YOU MAY. GO OUT FOR AN RFP I ON THE BOARD MAKES A DECISION BASED ON MANY FACTORS WHETHER IT'S COST pWHETHER IT'S QUALIFICATIONS AND THEN LATER ON BECAUSE OF CHANGE ORDERS YOU HAVE QUITE A BIT OF DIFFERENCE IN WHAT WAS INITIALLY PRESENTED. SO -- AS FAR AS THIS CONFLICT THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT -- I THINK RIGHT NOW IT'S VERY SPECIFIC. TO THE ARCHITECTS BUT IT DOES NOT MEAN WE'RE NOT WILLING TO LOOK AT TO EXPANSION OR EVEN NOT WORKING WITH THE OPPOSITION VERY CAREFULLY WILL BUT SO THAT READING IS IT'S ENGINEERED GEOLOGIST ARCHITECT LAND SURVEYOR OR PLANNER. RIGHT REFORM IN SPECIFIED SERVICES ON A PROJECTS SO THERE'S SEVERAL DIFFERENT OF THE DESIGN THE DESIGN TEAM IN ESSENCE BUT WHAT I'M SAYING WHAT I'M GETTING AT IS IS THIS SAYING THAT HEY THEY CAN NEVER BE FOUND TO HAVE A CONFLICT UNDER. TEN NINETY IF THIS BILL PASSES IT'S IT'S A BLANKET EXEMPTION IF THEY WERE INVOLVED IN THE PRE CONSTRUCTION WORK THEY CAN NEVER BE FOUND TO HAVE A CONFLICT IS NOT CORRECT. NOT THAT I'M UNDERSTANDING IT THAT WAY YEAH I KNOW THAT I'M ROGER PALM PRESIDENT RICK ENGINEERING COMPANY -- AND A MEMBER OF A CC WE'VE WORKED -- MY MEMBERSHIP -- WITH AN ORGANIZATION FOR NUMBER YEARS ON THIS. THIS THIS BILL IF IT WERE PASSED IN ITS CURRENT FORM WOULD NOT PRECLUDE IT WOULD NOT BY STATUTES SAY THAT THERE IS NO CONFLICT OF INTEREST YOU WOULD SAY BY STATUTE. THAT THERE ISN'T NECESSARILY A CONFLICT. IT WOULD ENABLE -- A PUBLIC AGENCY. TO SELECT A A PARTICULAR DESIGN PROFESSIONALS TO PERFORM SUBSEQUENT SERVICE DOESN'T TELL THEM TO DO THAT. BUT IT WOULDN'T NECESSARILY PRECLUDE THEM FROM BEING ABLE TO PROVIDE THOSE OVER FOR SERVICES. IN IN A PUBLIC AGENCY IS AS IT WOULD ALLOW THE PUBLIC AGENCY THAT CHOICE. TWO SELECT A NEW CONSULT IF THEY'RE DOING THE PROJECT IN MULTIPLE FACES. REDOING A PRELIMINARY DESIGN PHASE THE SUB TO THE WE DECIDE FOR EXAMPLE THAT THEY HAVE FUNDING AND ABLE TO MOVE THE PROJECT ON TO THE NEXT PHASE. THEY WOULD. THEY WOULD UNLESS THERE WAS SOME OTHER EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES OUTLINED IN A IN IN THE BILL THEY WOULD BE. THAT BY STATUTE THEY WOULD BE PRECLUDED FROM USING THE SAME DESIGN. FOR HER SUBSEQUENT FATE. IT WOULD ALLOW THEM. BUT IT WOULDN'T COME HELD THEM. TO USE THAT SAME CARD. RIGHT BUT ISN'T THAT KIND OF CURRENT LAW AS WELL BECAUSE LIKE AS YOU SAID MOST OF THE TIME THAT AT PPC HAS WEIGHED IN ON THIS THEY FOUND THAT THERE ISN'T A CONFLICT HOWEVER. THERE HAVE BEEN CASES. WHERE THEY HAVE FOUND -- SO FOR EXAMPLE FROM THE ANALYSIS THERE WAS A SIMON ADVICE LETTER. IN REACHING THAT CONCLUSION THAT THERE WAS A CONFLICT THE F. B. PC NOTED THAT THE ARCHITECTURAL FIRM WAS ENTER CURRENT INTEGRALLY INVOLVED IN THE PRELIMINARY DISCUSSIONS. NEGOTIATIONS REASONING PLANNING AND SPECIFICATIONS THAT WILL RESULT IN THE CONTRACT FOR ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN. OF A NEW JAIL AND AND THEREFORE HAS THE POTENTIAL. TO EXERT CONSIDERABLE INFLUENCE OVER THE COUNTIES DECISIONS CONCERNING -- ZONING ASSEMBLY MEMBER GALLAGHER I THINK ONE OF THE ISSUES ISN'T THAT THEY COULDN'T. FIND A CONFLICT OR THAT THEY COULD I THINK IT'S THE CLARITY. BECAUSE RIGHT NOW THERE'S THIS NARRATIVE. THAT IF YOU START WITH THE DESIGN PHASE THEN IT RISKY TO MOVE TO THE NEXT PART OF THE PROJECT AND IN ORDER TO BE EXTREME. IN ESSENCE A SAFE VERSUS SORRY THERE'S THERE'S COLLUDED RIGHT THEY'RE MAKING THAT DECISION THEMSELVES WITHOUT EVEN GOING THROUGH THE F. T. C. C. N. SO THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THE F. T. C. C.. STILL WOULDN'T SAY THERE'S A CONFLICT DEPENDING ON THE PROJECT I MEAN I THINK THAT EACH ONE OF THESE CASES END OF IT IS INDIVIDUALLY LOOKED AT SO YOU'RE SAYING THAT WOULD JUST REALLY QUICKLY SO YOU'RE SAYING IN. IN YOUR COMPANY'S CASE YOU'LL EVEN EXCLUDE YOURSELVES FROM. OTHER WORK ON THE JOB OTHER WORK ON A PARTICULAR JOB BECAUSE YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT THIS. ABSOLUTELY. IF THERE'S A LOCAL PAYS FOR A PROJECT IT'S REALLY SIMPLE DAY TYPICALLY NOT NECESSARILY ALWAYS BUT TYPICALLY THE FRONT END OF A PROJECT FOR LIMON EVERY SERVICES. INVOLVES A LESSER AND LOWERED FEET. THAT L. HIGHER FEE IS USUALLY ATTENDED WITH THE PROPRIETORS PREPARATION OF CONSTRUCTION DOCUMENTS AND SPECIFICATIONS RIGHT IF YOU FEEL THAT YOU'RE WELL QUALIFIED TO DO EITHER BUT YOU KNOW THAT YOU'VE GOT A CHANCE TO DO ONE OR THE OTHER. SOME FIRMS AND WHERE ONE OF THEM HAVE IT TIMES DECIDED WE'RE GONNA KEEP OUR POWDER DRY ON THE FRONT END OF THIS PROJECT BELIEVING THAT THERE WILL BE A SECOND PHASE AND THEN COMPETE ONLY ON THE BACKEND. OKAY [inaudible] YES IN. SO WHAT I STRUGGLE WITH THE JUST A LITTLE BIT HERE IS BECAUSE I CAN SEE THAT THERE COULD BE CONFLICTS YOU KNOW AND AND I THINK THERE'S INSTANCES FOR EXAMPLE WHERE THERE'S MAYBE. YEAH EVEN IN SMALL TOWNS WHERE THERE'S ONLY. ONE YOU KNOW GROUP IN TOWN AND THEY HELP TO THE KIDS THE DESIGN AND AND ULTIMATELY YOU KNOW SURPRISE SURPRISE THEY GET THE CONTRACT. YOU KNOW DOWN THE ROAD I MEAN SAID THERE THERE IS ESPECIALLY WHEN THERE'S A LOT OF INVOLVEMENT ON THE FRONT I'M WITH HOW THIS THING GET SET UP. YOU KNOW WHAT THEY'RE LOOKING FOR I THINK THERE COULD BE ISSUES OF CONFLICT OF INTEREST TEN NINETY IS A REALLY HARSH. STANDARD AS WE KNOW AND AND AND I THINK THE OTHER ISSUE HERE IS THAT USUALLY. AT LEAST THE WAY I'VE ALWAYS HEARD EXPLAINED TEN NINETY IS REALLY SPECIFICALLY GEARED TOWARDS ELECTED OFFICIALS AND PUBLIC EMPLOYEES. IT'S NOT REALLY THE INTENT OF IT IS NOT TO GO AFTER CONTRACTORS -- HOWEVER SINCE WHERE THEY GET SO INTER TWINED IN THE DECISION MAKING. THAT THERE COULD BE AN ISSUE AND SO. THAT'S A MAN THAT'S WHY I THINK I KIND OF STRUGGLE WITH THIS BILL LITTLE BIT THERE COULD BE THE THE CONFLICT. BUT AS YOU SAY -- AND IN MANY CASES THERE REALLY ISN'T AS PRECLUDING GOOD PEOPLE FROM BILLION -- PROJECTS -- AND I THINK IT IS BECAUSE OF THE DILEMMA IT I MEAN I I'VE SAID PROBABLY THREE TIMES TO MY LOCAL COUNCIL DAYS. I IT YOU MAY HAVE AN INITIAL. ARCHITECT DESIGN FIRM THAT DOES INDEED GET THE NEXT PART OF THE PHASE AND IF YOU ANALYZE THAT IS WELL I MEAN IF THERE'S ONLY. ONE IN A SMALL CITY OF THERE'S ONLY ONE BIG FIRM. THERE ARE IN ANY THEY'RE USING THIS THIS PRACTICE IN THAT VERY WELL COULD BE ON THE OTHER HAND IF YOU HAVE MULTIPLE FIRMS I KNOW. IN FULLER TEN WE YOU I WAS PART OF THE LAST MAJOR REDEVELOPMENT PROJECT. THAT WE HAD IN SOME OF THOSE WERE SUBSTANTIAL THIRTY MILLION DOLLAR PROJECTS TO TO DESIGN REDO A LIBRARY COMMUNITY CENTER SOME OF THESE PROJECTS. AND WE DID IN FACT USE THE SAME FIRM FOR BOTH PROJECTS ON THE OTHER HAND THERE WERE OTHER PROJECTS THAT WE DID NOT USE THEM BUT WE DID USE THE SAME FIRM FROM BEGINNING. TO END ON TWO PROJECTS I CAN THINK OF BUT WE HAD MULTIPLE PROJECTS THAT WE DIDN'T USE THEM. FOR THANK. DID TO JUST ONE LAST POINT. ONE LAST POINT YOU KNOW I THINK WE RECOGNIZE WE COULD USE SOME FINE TUNING AS WE MOVE ALONG HERE -- ONE OF THAT ONE OF THE LETTERS THAT WAS GIVEN TO THE COMMITTEE RAISE THE ISSUE OF DESIGN BUILD WE'VE ALREADY OFFERED AN AMENDMENT TO EXEMPT DESIGN BUILD THEY HAVE THEIR OWN SPECIFIC STATUTES WITH RESPECT TO CONFLICT FOR DESIGN BUILD. WAS NOT OUR INTENT TO GO AFTER THOSE THINGS AND SO WE ARE ABSOLUTELY WILLING TO KEEP FINE TUNING IS THE BILL MOVES THROUGH THE PROCESS GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COLLEAGUES. SO I THINK WHAT OFFER CLICK IMAGE CHAIRS AGAIN LISTEN IS CONVERSATION OR ALRIGHT ABOUT CONFLICTS OF INTEREST WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE BUT WE KEEP THE PUBLIC'S TRUST. EVEN BE EVEN IN REGARDS TO BIDDING I THINK ABOUT THE SMALL COMMUNITIES AND VERY SMALL PROJECTS THIS IS WHEN THIS BECOMES. REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE YOU MIGHT NOT GET ENOUGH BEDS -- YOU MIGHT NOT HAVE SOMEBODY BED AFTER THE DOING THE PLUMBER DESIGN WORK TO ACTUALLY DO DO TO DO THE PROJECT AND SO -- AGAIN MY WILL JUST BEFORE MAKING THE MOTION I THINK THE AUTHORS WELL WHERE THIS INITIAL CONTINUE WORK ON THIS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN GET CONTINUE. TO KEEP THE PUBLIC TRUST IT IN MIND -- AND AND WORK ON IT AS AS WE GO FORWARD THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- WITH THAT WE HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. I JUST THAT I'D LIKE TO MENTION THAT IT'S NOT THE INTENT OF THIS LEGISLATION TO SUPERSEDE THE CONFLICT OF INTEREST PROVISIONS THAT ARE ALREADY PRESENT UNDER DESIGN BUILD. AUTHORIZING STATUTES AND WE COMMIT TO CONTINUING TO WORK ON THIS GREAT I APPRECIATE THAT -- YEAH THE I AGREE WITH THE MOST OF IF NOT ALL THE CAUGHT -- COMMENTS ARE MADE BY MY COLLEAGUES THIS IS PROBABLY THE BILL THAT I STRUGGLE WITH THE MOST AND AND THERE WERE A LOT OF BILLS I STRUGGLE WITH IN THIS HEARING -- BUT THERE I'M CONVINCED THAT THERE IS A A PROBLEM THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM DOESN'T CREATE OTHER PROBLEMS -- AND I'M NOT CONVINCED OF THAT TODAY -- WHICH IS WHY. YEAH WE'VE WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THE AUTHORS OFFICE -- BUT WITH THE AUTHOR AND THE SPONSORS COMMITMENT TO CONTINUE WORKING ON THE BILL WITH INTERESTED PARTIES WITH THE OPPOSITION -- AND WITH THE F. F. PPC. AND WITH THE THE EXPLICIT UNDERSTANDING THAT I MAY ASK FOR THE BILL TO COME BACK TO THE COMMITTEE DEPENDING ON HOW THOSE DISCUSSIONS GO. I AM PREPARED TO SUPPORT THE BILL THE DAY TO A LOT OF DISCUSSION TO CONTINUE -- SO WITH THAT -- READY TO SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY. MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL THE MOTION IS TO PASS AND RE REFER TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS BERMAN AYE. BERMAN AYE AYE GALLAGHER GALLAGHER I CALDERON. CALDERON AYE LOW. NO I'M MAYES.

FROM LAKE ELSINORE FOR ALLOW ME GO AHEAD OF HER A GOOD MORNING MEMBERS OF COMMITTED I'M REPRESENTING AB ELEVEN FIFTY TODAY. IN MOST LARGE CITIES COMMUNITY COLLEGE BOARD MEMBERS ARE REQUIRED TO EITHER PAY A FILING FEE OR PRODUCE SIGNATURES FROM THE COMMUNITY IF THEY'RE SEEKING TO REPRESENT. IN FACT ALL OF YOU IN THIS ROOM TODAY YOU HAD TO PAY A FEE OR GATHER UP TO THREE THOUSAND SIGNATURES TO NOT ONLY DEMONSTRATE YOUR COMMITMENT TO THIS OPPORTUNITY FOR PUBLIC SERVICE. BUT ALSO TO SHOW THAT YOU HAVE SUPPORT IN THE COMMUNITIES YOU WISH TO REPRESENT. THE CITY OF COMMITTEE CALLS DISTRICT BOARD AS WELL AS THE GROSS MONTHLY MARKET COLLEGE COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT BOARD I DO NOT HAVE THE SIMPLE DEMOCRATIC. REQUIREMENTS AB ELEVEN FIFTY ADDRESSES THIS BY REQUIRING CAN IT'S FOR THE GOVERNING BOARDS OF THESE TO COMMUTE BECAUSE DISTRICTS TO COLLECT AT LEAST A HUNDRED SIGNATURE ABOUT LEGAL BUT SIGNATURES OF VOTERS AND THEIR TRUSTY AREA. AND SUPPORTER CANDIDACY IN ORDER TO QUALIFY FOR THE BALLOT WITH THIS BASIC BALLOT APARTMENT THERE HAVE BEEN CASES OF CANDIDATES RUNNING FOR MULTIPLE OFFICES AT THE SAME TIME.

CORRECTLY -- SO TO HAVE TO GET A HUNDRED SIGNATURES TO BE ABLE TO BUT TO RUN FOR COLLEGE BUT I I GUESS I UNDERSTAND THAT THE PROBLEM THAT THERE'S MULTIPLE CANDIDATES THAT ARE RUNNING. IN THE SEATS AND MAYBE THEY'RE NOT REAL SERIOUS ABOUT ABOUT RUNNING AND SO YOU WOULD HAVE SOME SORT OF LEVEL PROTECTION BUT OUR ISN'T THE FILING FEES AND OTHER THINGS THAT HAVE TO BE DONE JUST SEEMS WEIRD THAT YOU HAVE TO CLICK THE HUNDRED SIGNATURES TO RUN FOR SCHOOL.

OKAY I GUESS SOMEONE WONDER WHAT WHAT ARE WE TRYING TO SOLVE FOR HERE WHAT'S THAT WHAT'S THE GOAL HERE WHAT WE SOLVING. FOR WE'RE ALSO TRYING TO ENSURE THAT THAT THAT THE CANDY THAT DIED THAT DAY WHICH TO SERVE IN THE DISTRICT -- THAT THEY DO HAVE SOME SUPPORT I'M KIND OF IN THE DISTRICT. OKAY THAT THAT THAT THE INSPIRATION OF A CANDIDACY IS NOT PUBLIC SERVICE IT'S NOT SELF AGGRANDIZEMENT -- WITH WITH NO FEE NO SIGNATURES -- YOU KNOW YOU SEE VACANCY DECIDE TO RUN -- IT OF ONE WOULD ARGUE THAT'S DEMOCRATIC BUT I WOULD SAY THAT THE THE THE PROCESS THAT WE REQUIRE OF A LOCAL SCHOOL BOARD MEMBERS AS WELL AS ADJACENT -- COUNTY BOARD SCHOOL THE SCHOOL BOARD MEMBERS -- AND OTHERS DO HAVE THIS REQUIREMENT IT'S UNUSUAL THAT THE SAN DIEGO COMMITTEE BECAUSE DISTRICT AS WELL AS THE GHOST BUCKLEY A MARKET DON'T HAVE -- ANY SUCH REQUIREMENTS OF HARMONIZING THAT WITH OTHER AREA EDUCATION BOARDS. THE NUMBERS ARE DIFFERENT TYPES OF SENATORS I WILL KNOWLEDGE THAT I WE WOULD WITH THE HIGHER -- ONE BUT AS YOU NOTED IT'S NOT. IT'S NOT SO ONEROUS THIS TO BE A DISQUALIFYING -- BUT JUST I THINK SHOWS MORE SERIOUSNESS OF THE PEOPLE WHO WISH TO APPROPRIATE MULTI MILLION DOLLAR BUDGETS -- CAM. SEE THE CHAIRS COME BACK HERE. CELL PAST EXPECTED BUT I GUESS THIS DRUG HERE'S WHY ISN'T THIS A LOCAL ISSUE AND IT SEEMS LIKE MAN WE GET A LOT OF SAN DIEGO ISSUES. HERE IN THE STATE LEGISLATURE WAS LIKE HEY MAN IF YOU GUYS HAVE PROBLEMS WITH YOUR LOCALS AND HOW THEY CONDUCT THINGS TALK TO YOUR CITY COUNCILMAN AND AND YEARS AND YEARS. TRUSTEES AND AND SAY HEY MAN WE THINK YOU GUYS SHOULD CHANGE YOUR STANDARDS. I DON'T THINK THAT WE SHOULD BE THE BODY. THAT ESTABLISHES THOSE FOR YOUR LOCAL ELECTIONS. YOU KNOW AND I SUSPECT HE DOES SINCE THE FEDERATION OF TEACHERS IS HERE THAT MAYBE THERE'S YOUR ANOTHER MOTIVE HERE AS WELL -- AND HE OF PEOPLE RUNNING FOR SELF AGGRANDIZEMENT AND POLITICS MEN THAT'S A PRETTY TOUGH PROBLEM TO SOLVE RIGHT THERE. NOT ONLY WE'RE GOING TO SOLVE IT IN THIS COMMITTEE BUT WITH THAT I JUST I MEAN SO THAT WOULD BE JUST MIGHT COME AS I THINK THIS TO BE BETTER HANDLED LOCALLY -- BUT I UNDERSTAND THE CONCERN. THANK YOU RECOVERING MISTER RESTER -- ANY ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS YEAHYEAH. HI. I JUST WANTED -- TO I DON'T KNOW WHICH ONE IS MY PHONE YEAH I GUESS IT IS THANK YOU -- I WANT TO THANK MY CYNICAL COLLEAGUE FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD I HAD NO IDEA THAT THEY DIDN'T HAVE. TO FILE ANY ANY ELVES SIGNATURES AND MAINLY BECAUSE IT'S PRETTY MUCH A STANDARD IN CAL IN SAN DIEGO THAT I WAS ON THE SCHOOL BOARD AND YOU KNOW ALL THE OTHER SCHOOL BOARDS AND WHAT HAVE YOU THAT. THE ASSUMPTION IS THAT EVERYBODY'S COLLECTING SIGNATURES IN -- TO DEMONSTRATE THAT THEY HAVE SOME SUPPORT OF FORD AND SO -- SO I AND YOU KNOW I THIS IS INTERESTING THAT THEY DIDN'T SO I HAVE I WOULD DEFINITELY SUPPORT IT WHY DOESN'T DO LOCAL STUFF THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION. OKAY AND I THINK THAT THE PRESIDENT MAY WOULD HAVE TO GO TO THE BALLOT I THINK OR THEY DON'T HAVE TO GO THE BALLOT THEY COULD DO IT THEMSELVES. WHAT THE I MEAN THE THESE ARE ENTITIES OF THE STATE OKAY SO I'LL HAVE RESPONSIBILITIES THAT'S WHY WE'RE WE'RE BRINGING IT FORWARD CRACKED OKAY OKAY THAT IS? BUT I I I SUPPORTED I MEAN WE REALLY NEED -- TO AND OF SAN DIEGO IS IS INTERESTING IT'S IT'S A IT'S A BIG CITY THAT JUST BECAME BIG IN MENTALITY IN THE LAST FEW YEARS. YOU KNOW OF IF YOU GO THERE YOU THINK IT'S REALLY LIKE A LITTLE HOME TOWN -- IN A LOT OF PEOPLE'S MINDS AND SO MUCH MANY OF THE POLICIES AND THINGS HAVE BEEN THERE HAVE REALLY BEEN VERY PAROCHIAL IN TERMS OF OF HOW WE OPERATE IT'S IT IS A DIFFERENT PLACE AND SELL. OF THEIR A LOT OF THINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING NOW IN THE CITY TO HARMONIZE. WHAT DO PRACTICES EXIST BETWEEN VARIOUS AREAS AND AND SO MANY THERE'S SEVERAL DIFFERENT OF COMMUNICABLE AS BOARDS IN SAN DIEGO -- AS WELL AS SCHOOL BOARDS AND SO -- THERE'S A LOT OF EFFORTS TO TRY TO STANDARDIZE THE EXPECTATIONS THAT ARE THERE BECAUSE PEOPLE LIVE IN ONE AREA BUT WORK SOMEWHERE ELSE AND SO THE ASSUMPTION IS. THAT IT'S PRETTY MUCH ONE BUT IS IT REALLY IS NOT SO I WOULD SUPPORT THIS I THINK IT'S IT'S IT'S MODEST IN TERMS OF THAT IT'S A LARGE AREA SO BEING ABLE TO COLLECT HUNDRED SIGNATURES. YOU CAN DO THAT IN A LESS THAN A WEEK IN IN FRONT OF A MALL OR FOR JUST KNOCK ON PEOPLE'S DOORS AND WE'D HAVE BEEN FAIRLY LIBERAL ABOUT FOLKS. ACTUALLY NOT MEETING THE TARGET -- IF THEY GO TO COURT WHICH IS OUT NOW THE WHOLE WEIRD STORY ITSELF THAT HAPPENS ALL THE TIME IN SAN DIEGO -- WHERE YOU ONLY HAVE NINETY EIGHT SIGNATURES EVEN THOUGH HE TOOK A HUNDRED AND FIVE AND SO YOU STILL IN UP ON THE BALLOT? BUT NONE THE LESS I I SUPPORT THIS AND I THANK YOU FOR BRINGING FORTH. THANK YOU DOCTOR OUR MISTER CALDERON. THIS GUY THAT THE BILL MAKES SENSE I GET IT I APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO HERE -- I MEAN I THINK THE HUNDRED IS A LITTLE BIT HIGH I THINK IF IT'S GOOD FOR IS GOOD FOR US TO COULD BE GOOD FOR THEM. I KNOW IT'S NOT THAT DIFFICULT BUT STILL KIND OF A PAIN IN THE IT DOESN'T IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT IT SHOULD BE THERE IT JUST. YOU KNOW WE CAN BE A LITTLE BIT MORE REASONABLE ON THE THE NUMBER OF SIGNATURES THAT WE'RE ASKING FOR NOT A LOT OF DIFFERENT REASONS WHY THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE A LOT OF DIFFERENT REASONS THAT SOMEBODY MAY PUT THEIR NAME ON THE BALLOT. IN ALTHOUGH THERE ARE LAWS PROTECTING AGAINST THIS IT DOESN'T STILL PRECLUDE PEOPLE FROM PUTTING THE NAME ON A BALLOT BECAUSE THEY WANT TO UNDER CUT ANOTHER PERSON SO THAT THEY DON'T WIN AND SO THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT REASONS. WHY PEOPLE PUT THEIR NAMES ON THE BALLOT BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT ANYBODY WHO WANTS TO RUN FOR OFFICE WE WANT TO ENCOURAGE THEM TO RUN FOR OFFICE BUT THEY ALSO HAVE TO HAVE A STAKE? AND THERE HAS TO BE AT LEAST SOME LEVEL OF SUPPORT WITHIN THE COMMUNITY SO THAT THEY'RE NOT JUST PUTTING. THEY'RE NOT JUST PUTTING THE NAME ON THE BALLOT FOR THE SAKE OF PUTTING THEM IN NAME ON THE BALLOT FOR WHATEVER REASONS -- AS OUR MOTIVATING THEM IT'S THERE THERE'S INVESTMENT THERE AND OUR PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY THAT THEY'RE TALKING TO AND THEY'RE ACTUALLY. DOING THE WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE FOR TO RUN A LEGITIMATE CAMPAIGN TO BE A LEGITIMATE -- PUBLIC OFFICIAL IF IN FACT THEY DO IT. THANK YOU. THE MISTER CALDERON DID ALL THIS IS MADE JUST ONE LAST THING AND BUT JUST BE QUICK AND ACTUALLY DO AGREE WITH -- MISTER CALDERON -- BUT THE IDEA THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME LIMIT YOU GOT TO HAVE SOME SOME BOMB BAIRD ENTRY IF YOU WILL NOT EVERYBODY SHOULD BE ABLE TO HAVE. OTHER NAME ON ABOUT YOU GOT TO SHOW THAT THERE SOME SOME OF THE SUPPORT I I DO WONDER THOUGH SHOULD THIS BE THE STATE RULE THAT APPLIES TO ALL OF THE ALL SCHOOL DISTRICTS ALL CALLS DISTRICTS -- BUT WHY DO WE LIMIT DISTRICT FOR FOR THOSE FOR THOSE. TWO WITH THIS IN LEASES IN SAN DIEGO AREA THE ONES THAT WE'VE IDENTIFIED I MEAN. STATEWIDE LEGISLATION I GUESS WOULD BE MAYBE SOMETHING THAT THIS COMMITTEE COULD CONSIDER -- SUGGESTING. I WOULD SAY SPEAK FOR YOUR COMMUNITIES BUT I KNOW THIS IS THE NATION'S INDIA OKAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WITH THAT MISTER GORE WE LIKE TO CLOSE OUR THE CHEF OF THE TIME IT WILL HAPPEN. DOCTOR WEBER NOW HAVE EXPLAINED THE COMMITTEE WHY SAN DIEGO'S CHANGING -- OUR PHYSICAL PRESENCE HERE IS THE ILLUSTRATION OF THAT -- AND SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR EITHER THANK YOU VERY MUCH. A CANDIDATES FOR MANY OFFICES ARE REQUIRED TO COLLECT SIGNATURES ON NOMINATION PAPERS IN ORDER TO QUALIFY TO BE ON THE BALLOT THAT'S ESPECIALLY TRUE IN LARGER JURISDICTIONS WHERE THE POTENTIAL POOL OF CANDIDATES IS LARGER. THIS BILL WOULD IMPOSE A MODEST NOMINATION REQUIREMENT FOR CANDIDATES IN TO COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICTS IN THE NEAR THE AUTHORS DISTRICT SO I'M RECOMMENDING SUPPORT. ON THIS DISTRICT BILL WITH THAT -- WE PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. THE MOTION IS TO PASS AND RE REFER TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS BERMAN HI BERMAN HI GALLAGHER. GALLAGHER NO CALDERON CALDERON I LOW. LOW I'M MAYES. MAYES AYE MULLIN WEBER. WEBER I THAT BILL IS OUT ON A FIVE TO ONE VOTE OKAY THE ROLE OPEN FOR ABSENT MEMBERS COLLEAGUES I WOULD JUST LIKE TO REMIND EVERYBODY THAT WE HAVE.

PLEASE WHENEVER YOU'RE READY THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I AM HERE TODAY TO PRESENT TO YOU AB. THREE FIVE NINE AFTER SERVING THE LEGISLATURE FORMER ASSEMBLY MEMBERS AND SENATORS OFTEN REGISTERED LOBBYISTS TO MAKE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS REPRESENTING CORPORATIONS AND SPECIAL INTEREST GROUPS. MANY HAVE RESIGNED FROM OFFICE IN ORDER TO WORK FOR LARGE CORPORATE FIRMS. NEARLY EVERY STATE HAS STRONG REVOLVING DOOR PROHIBITIONS TO FOR BED FORMER LEGISLATORS FROM LOBBYING FOR CERTAIN AMOUNT OF TIME INDENTURE FORMER OFFICIALS DON'T INTENTIONALLY OR UNINTENTIONALLY. PLACE IMPROPER INFLUENCE ON STAFFING COLLEAGUES YET CALIFORNIA HAS ONE OF THE MOST LENIENT REVOLVING DOOR POLICIES ONLY WHEN YOU'RE AFTER THEY SERVE THEY CAN ENTER IT AS A LOBBYIST. IT DOES THIS DOES NOT GO NEARLY FAR ENOUGH TO COMBAT POLITICAL CORRUPTION WITH A TEAR LEGISLATIVE CYCLE FORMER LEGISLATORS CAN HEAVILY INFLUENCE POLICY NEGOTIATIONS THAT THEY TOOK PART OF JUST A YEAR PRIOR AS A LEGISLATOR. EXCEPT THIS TIME THEY CAN INFLUENCE NEGOTIATIONS WITH FISCAL PROMISES AND TIME AND TIME AGAIN CALIFORNIA LEGISLATORS HAVE CONTINUED TO RESIGN TO TAKE HIGHER PAYING LOBBYING JOBS -- AB THREE FIFTY NINE WILL EXTEND THE PROHIBITION ON FORMER ASSEMBLY MEMBERS AND SENATORS LOBBYING THE LEGISLATURE TO FIVE YEARS ALONG A COOLING OFF PERIOD BETWEEN LEGISLATORS TIME IN OFFICE IN THEIR ABILITY TO INFLUENCE CURRENT POLICY NEGOTIATIONS. THIS BILL IS SUPPORTED BY CONSUMER WATCHDOG CALIFORNIA LANDS A RETIRED AMERICANS IN THE LEAGUE OF WOMEN VOTERS -- I DOOR REYES IS HERE FROM THE LEAGUE OF WOMEN VOTERS TO TESTIFY I WOULD LIKE TO ADD THOUGH THAT I KNOW THERE'S BEEN SOME DISCUSSION ABOUT THE LENGTH OF TIME -- AND TO MY KNOWLEDGE NO ONE'S OFFICE HAS COMMUNICATED THAT THEY WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE AMOUNT OF TIME LOWERED THOUGH I'M OPEN TO THAT SO PERHAPS IT COULD BE PART OF THE DISCUSSION TODAY WITH THAT MISTER REISS FAMILY WOMEN BETTER SCRIPT THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN ASSEMBLY MEMBERS OF THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY TODAY ON BEHALF AND IN SUPPORT OF AB. THREE FIFTY NINE OF ALL OF THE FEATURES IN THE MODERN POLITICAL SYSTEM PERHAPS NONE THAT FUELS PUBLIC CYNICISM. AS MUCH AS THE REVOLVING DOOR BETWEEN PUBLIC SERVICE AND PAID LOBBYING. IN PARTICULAR ADVOCACY. ON BEHALF OF WELL FUNDED CORPORATE INTERESTS. T. LOBBYIST DRAWN FROM THE RANKS OF FORMER LEGISLATORS ARE ABLE TO TRADE ON THEIR RELATIONSHIPS WITH THOSE FORMER LEGISLATORS WITH THEIR PAST COLLEAGUES. TO USE EXPERTISE THAT'S BEEN ACQUIRED WHEN THEY WERE IN THESE HALLS DOING THE PEOPLE'S BUSINESS. THEY BRING INSIDER SAVVY RIGHT THEY THEY KNOW WHO THE LEGISLATORS THEY KNOW HOW TO PITCH MESSAGING THEY UNDERSTAND THE INTRICACIES OF CAUCUS DYNAMICS. THEY ENJOY ACCESS IT'S HAD BY VERY FEW OF US THEY CAN GET BUSINESS DONE OVER TAX THEY CAN GET BUSINESS DONE OVER TO A STEAK DINNERS WE'VE ALL SEEN. RECENTLY OR THAT COUPLE YEARS AGO THERE WAS A ASSEMBLY BILL. THAT WAS INTRODUCED TO REDUCE AIR POLLUTION AND AIR POLLUTION REDUCTION BILL. FULL DISCLOSURE THIS WAS A BILL THAT WAS SUPPORTED BY THE LEAGUE AT THE TIME [inaudible] SO. IT WENT DOWN IN A REALLY TIGHT VOTE. AND IT WENT DOWN AFTER BIG OIL HIRED FORMER LEGISLATORS. OF A WELL LIKED FOR LEGISLATORS INFLUENTIAL ONES TO LOBBY THEIR COLLEAGUES. ON ON OILS BEHALF. WHILE RECENT LEGISLATION HAS TIGHTENED READ THE STAFF ANALYSIS THE RULES FOR OF LEGISLATORS WHO RESIGNED MID TERM THE LEAGUE OF WOMEN VOTERS DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT THAT IS SUFFICIENT [inaudible] IT. IN FACT WE THINK THERE ARE LACKS RESTRICTIONS ACTUALLY LEGITIMIZE THE BETRAYAL OF THE PUBLIC TRUST BY FORMER LEGISLATORS. AS THE WORK AGAINST THE INTERESTS OF THOSE VERY CONSTITUENTS WHO PUT THEM INTO OFFICE. ORDINARY VOTERS SHOULD NEVER BE SECOND PLACE THEY SHOULD NEVER BE SECOND PLACE TO MONEYED INTEREST TO PERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS THEY SHOULD NEVER BE SECOND PLACE. TO TO THE LOWER OF THE PRIVATE SECTOR. TO THE EXTENT THAT AB THREE FIFTY NINE TO TURN SOME CANDIDATES SPEEDED UP. ELECTED OFFICE THAT'S A FEATURE NOT A BUG THE LAW IS GOING TO HAVE A SALUTARY EFFECT ON FILTERING OUT CANDIDATES WHO ARE PURSUING ELECTIVE OFFICE FOR THE WRONG REASONS. IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN FLORIDA VOTERS APPROVE THE MOST STRINGENT COOLING OFF ON THE NATION MANDATING A SIX YEAR PERIOD. BEFORE FOR LEGISLATORS CAN TAKE ON PAY LOBBYING CALIFORNIA HAS THE OPPORTUNITY HERE. TO REINFORCE ITS REPUTATION AS THE LEADER IN CLEAN GOVERNMENT. THIS LEGISLATION REPRESENTS A REALLY BOLD STATEMENT IN SUPPORT OF ACCOUNTABLE RESPONSIVE POLITICS THAT LEVELS THE PLAYING FIELD FOR ALL OF CALIFORNIA'S VOTERS SO WE DO REQUEST YOUR SUPPORT ON THIS BILL AB THREE FIFTY NINE THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT DO YOU [inaudible] PLEASE. I'M. SORT OF SUPPORT -- DISCOVER COULD MONEY CAMPAIGN -- THREE VERY WELL. IF AMENDED -- WEEK WE CAN'T TAKE A POSITION ON THE CURRENT FIVE YEAR BAN BUT WE DEFINITELY THINK A TWO YEAR RESTRICTION WOULD BE VERY VERY APPROPRIATE FOR ALL THE REASONS THAT THE LEAGUE OF WOMEN VOTERS. A SAID IN THE AUTHOR SAID WE THINK OFF THE FOR BRING THIS FORWARD AND AND WE WOULD DEFINITELY -- G. TO SUPPORT IT STRONGLY IF YOU. IF IT IS OMITTED THAT WAY THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH WILL CALL AT THE TWEETER SECTION ANY OTHER TWEENER. THERE IN THE AUDIENCE YEAH ANYONE IN OPPOSITION. SING NUMBERING ABOUT A COLLEGE FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS SEEING NONE. BRING BACK TO THE AUTHOR FOR CLOSE. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS WITHOUT A LONGER COOLING OFF PERIOD CORPORATIONS AND SPECIAL INTEREST GROUPS WILL HAVE JUST AS STRONG A VOICE AS THOSE WHO HONESTLY IN INTENTIONALLY BROUGHT US HERE ARE CONSTITUENTS. THE PEOPLE CALIFORNIA CHOSE US TO REPRESENT THEM AND WE HAVE TO CONSIDER WHETHER WHEN YOU'RE PROHIBITION IS REALLY NOT TO KEEP BUT TO KEEP ABUSE AND MANIPULATION FROM TAKING PLACE. IN OUR SYSTEM -- MEMBERS PLEASE I WOULD ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT THIS MORNING I KNOW THERE MAY BE SOME HESITATION BUT I THINK I SUSPECT THAT EVERYBODY FEELS THE SAME AS I DO IS THAT WE NEED. TO BRING THIS UNDER CONTROL OF IT THINKING I SWEAR I ABOUT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH DOCTOR WEBER. I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT IF THIS IS REALLY A PROBLEM -- I REALLY AM BECAUSE I DON'T SEE A WHOLE LOT OF MEMBERS WALKING THE HALLS HERE. ARE GIVEN THE TERM LIMITS IN TERMS OF A LOT OF LOBBYIST I JUST DON'T SEE IT YOU KNOW I SEE THEM LEAVING TO RUN FOR THE OFFICES. BUT I CAN PROBABLY THINK OF ONE PERSON WHO IT AND WE DO ADDRESS THAT THE PERSON WHO LEFT IN THE MIDDLE OF A TERM. OUT WE'VE GOT SOME FOLKS WHO RETIRED WHO LEFT BECAUSE OF ALL THE OTHER STUFF THAT HAPPENED WANTED TO SO I'M JUST TRYING TO YOU KNOW I'M I'M I I I UNDERSTAND THE FIVE YEARS I MAY THINK IT'S KIND OF EXCESSIVE IN TERMS A CERTAIN EXTENT. BECAUSE YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW MAYBE BECAUSE AT THAT I HAVE NO DESIRE TO BE A LOBBYIST EVER AND I DON'T KNOW -- AND SO MAYBE THIS IS NOT AN ATTRACTION. NO FANS NO BUT I MEAN IS GIVEN WHERE I AM IN MY LIFE YOU KNOW I DON'T WANT TO BE IN ON IN A WHEELCHAIR AS A LOBBYIST BUT NONE THE LESS AND I'M SURE THERE'S SOME OR OR ON CRUTCHES OR WHATEVER BUT A WALKER BUT ALL OF IT. HUH BUT I'M JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT IF THERE'S IF THERE'S A PROBLEM YOU KNOW I MEAN. I SEE CREATING A RULE BUT I DON'T NECESSARILY SEE THAT HAPPENING HERE SO THAT'S THAT'S MY CONCERN THAT I JUST DON'T SEE. OF FOLKS LEAVING IMMEDIATE COMING BACK AS LOBBYIST I MEAN I'VE SEEN SOME WILL WORK WITH. AGENCIES NOT AS LOBBYISTS BUT JUST AS CONSULTANTS OR WHATEVER SO I'M JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHERE THE PROBLEM IS THAT THAT'S MY NUMBER ONE CONCERN I DON'T. KNOW I I DON'T WANT TO JUST START CHANGING NUMBERS FOR THE SAKE OF CHANGING NUMBERS AND WE GO TO FIVE AND THEN DISCOVER. THAT'S REALLY DIFFICULT FOR PEOPLE WHO -- BECAUSE YOU GET INTO THIS PUT THESE JOBS IN THERE THERE'S NOT A WHOLE LOT OF JOB SECURITY INVOLVED IN IT. YOU GOT TWELVE YEARS TWELVE YEARS OF YOUR EARNING A LIFE EARNING WITHOUT PENSION WITHOUT BENEFITS WITHOUT ALL THAT STUFF THAT COMES IN SO YOU KNOW ALL THAT WEIGHS ON ME THAT I I RECOGNIZE THE FOLKS HERE MAKING. QUITE A SACRIFICE TO A CERTAIN EXTENT TO BE HERE ESPECIALLY THOSE WERE YOUNGER AND THIS IS THERE YOU KNOW WHAT TIME AND WHICH THEY SHOULD BE TRYING TO DEVELOP A PENSION OR SOMETHING. AND THEY'RE NOT BECAUSE IT DOING THE PEOPLE'S BUSINESS FOR TEN TWELVE YEARS AND OLDER ROUNDER HUH THANKS FOR THE REMINDER YEAH IT. IS TIME YOU KNOW I'M I'M EMPATHETIC TO WHAT DO TO THAT GENERATION SO. I YEAH I I JUST THE END IS NOT THAT I'M OPPOSED TO IT I JUST NEED A BETTER ARGUMENT THAT THAT THIS IS HAPPENING BECAUSE I DON'T REALLY. SEE IT A LOT NUMBER ONE AND NUMBER. TWO FOLKS ARE INFLUENCED BY VARIOUS PEOPLE UP HERE I DON'T I HOPE THAT PEOPLE AREN'T SO OVERLY INFLUENCES SIMPLY BECAUSE I KNEW YOU AT ONE POINT IN YOUR LIFE. THAT YOU MAY HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO TALK TO ME BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN I WILL VOTE FOR THE CRAZINESS THAT YOU MIGHT BE. PROMOTING AT THE TIME SO. AT TELL ME THERE'S A PROBLEM I'M JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE PROBLEM IS WHEN I LOOK AT THE NUMBERS EVEN THE RATIONALE A LOOK AT THE NUMBERS AND I TRY NOT TO BASE DID SOMETHING YOU KNOW BECAUSE THEN THAT AFFECTS. A WHOLE LOT OF FOLKS WHO NOT DOING THAT SO. I DON'T KNOW I'VE MAYBE I'M I'M NOT AWARE OF IT BUT I'D LIKE TO KNOW THAT THERE'S A PROBLEM. BEFORE I'D GO TO ONE FOR ONE TO FIVE YOU KNOW I I'D LIKE TO KNOW THAT THERE'S A PROBLEM. WELL FIRST. I'M AS A MATTER PRINCIPLE THE LEAGUE'S POSITION IS THAT. THE LEGISLATURE'S NOT A TRAINING GROUND FOR A LUCRATIVE CAREER AND THAT'S NOT THE WAY WE WANT OUR REPRESENTATIVES TO BE THINKING ABOUT IT THEY REPRESENT THE INTERESTS OF THE VOTERS. THEN THAT DO NOT. REPRESENT THE INTEREST. OF OR THEY SHOULD NOT REPRESENT THE INTERESTS OF CORPORATIONS WHICH IS WHAT THIS KIND OF CHURN THIS REVOLVING DOOR. OF RESULTS IN. I DID COME WITH THE ONE EXAMPLE OF AND IT WAS ASSEMBLY MEMBER CRISTINA GARCIA IS BILL COUPLE YEARS AGO MANY OF YOU VOTED IN FAVOR OF IT. OUT TO REDUCE POLLUTION AND THAT NARROW. DEFEAT THAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT WAS VERY CLEARLY THE DIRECT RESULT OF THE LOBBYING BY FOUR FORMER LEGISLATORS. WHO WERE HIRED SPECIFICALLY BY? OIL COMPANIES AND BLOOM PRESS ONE OTHER INDUSTRY. TO DEFEAT THE BILL AND THEY WILL IT WORKED THEY DID YOUR HONOR THIS REALLY NARROW. NARROW. WAY. ON THE FLOOR. ASSEMBLY MEMBER GARCIA WAS. IN. TWO BECAUSE SHE COULD NOT BELIEVE THAT A BILL THAT WAS PITCH TO HELP HER CONSTITUENTS. AND AND HELP THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA COULD REALLY P. DEFEATED BY THE KINDS OF MAC IN NATIONS THAT GO ON WHEN THE FORMER LEGISLATORS BODY UP. WITH THE CURRENT LEGISLATORS AND AND TURN THE TIDE. IT WAS A SURPRISE AND WE SEE THOSE KINDS OF SURPRISES IN OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES AS WELL. WELL YEAH I MEAN. YEAH THAT'S ONE INSTANCE. WE SEATED OTHER INSTANCE INSTANCES BUT IN GENERAL IT IS SIMPLY THE WRONG DYNAMIC. IN THE TIME THAT I'VE BEEN HERE YOU AND I HAVE BEEN HERE AND THERE ARE THREE THAT I KNOW OF JUST OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD WHO WERE IN THE LEGISLATURE ONE IN THE SENATE. TO THE ASSEMBLY WHO LEFT -- IN MILITARY TERMS ONE LEFT FOR HEALTH REASONS THE OTHER TWO RESIGNED AND THEN THEY WENT ON TO BE LOBBYIST. I UNDERSTAND. THAT I UNDERSTAND THAT BUT I'M I'M I'M TRYING. TO YEAH I GUESS AND OKAY SO WE'VE HAD THREE AND SIX IT'S ALMOST SEVEN YEARS NOW -- SO I'M TRYING TO I'M JUST I STILL AM TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHERE THIS BIG PROBLEM IS AND AND AND AND I I UNDERSTAND THE THE THE PASSION AND THE EMOTIONS OF THOSE WHO. OF US WHO DO BILLS THAT WE REALLY ARE CONCERNED ABOUT AND ALL OF US FIGHT THE MONSTERS THAT ARE IN THE OTHER PLACE AND WE DON'T CALM THE THIRD HOUSE. WHAT BUT OUT THERE WHO WHO CAN LOBBY AND WHO CAN? GET PEOPLE TO DO THINGS MAYBE BECAUSE OF WHATEVER REASONS I HAVE NO IDEA THAT THEY CAN DO BUT BUT I'M JUST. YEAH I'M JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHERE THE PROBLEM IS IN THIS SEEMS LIKE SOMETHING IN SEARCH OF A PROBLEM IN AN ADULT. YOU KNOW AND I MAYBE BECAUSE I'M NOT THAT INFLUENCED BY LOBBYIST. YOU KNOW I HEAR PEOPLE NOT TAKING EVERYBODY'S INFORMATION BUT I'M NOT I JUST DON'T I DON'T SEE THIS -- THIS HAPPENING ON A REGULAR BASIS AND I'M NOT SURE IF. IN ANY OTHER AND AND AND POLITICS IS IS IS ONE ARENA BUT YOU KNOW YOU'VE GOT. OF FOLKS GET AN EXPERTISE IN SOMETHING LIKE POLITICS OR LIKE LOBBYING ALIKE LÃ  BIT BILL MAKING A BILL WRITING WHATEVER. OUT AND THEREFORE THEY SHOULD NEVER USE THAT SKILL AGAIN -- AS AS WAS SAYING A BEING TRYING TO DO SOMETHING THE WEATHER HERE. IN AND YET WE HAVEN'T REALLY ATTACK THE REAL ISSUE WHICH IS OF UNFORTUNATELY TERM LIMITS AND ALL THOSE OTHER THINGS THAT THE KEY PEOPLE FROM ACTUALLY. DEVELOPING -- HERE AS REAL GOOD LEGISLATORS. AND AND BASICALLY OF A MASKING THE KIND OF KNOWLEDGE AND SKILL TO SO ESSENTIAL TO BE AN EFFECTIVE LEGISLATOR TAKES SEVERAL YEARS TO DO THAT -- SO I YOU KNOW I DON'T I DON'T KNOW I I I JUST. OF I WOULD LOVE TO SUPPORT SOMETHING BUT I'M NOT SURE GOING TO FIVE YEARS IS REALLY THE THE RIGHT THING TO DO IT MAYBE TWO YEARS MAY BE A GOOD TIME FRAME OR I'M NOT SURE BUT IT JUST SEEMS TO BE. A SOMEWHAT EXCESSIVE TO A CERTAIN EXTENT GIVEN THE FACT THAT AND THAT I DON'T HAVE EVIDENCE OF THIS IS A HUGE PROBLEM THANK AND UP AND I GUESS IT AND I'VE LOST BILLS AND% OTHERS OF LOS BILLS THAT WERE VERY PERSONAL. VERY EMOTIONAL FOR US COLLEAGUE GOT THEIR NOSE WE'VE GONE THROUGH SOME TEARS WITH SOME BILLS -- AND YOU KNOW AND HAVE BEEN DEFEATED BY WHO KNOWS WHAT MAYBE MONEY THAT'S PEOPLE GIVING FOLKS FOR CAMPAIGNS ALL KINDS OF THINGS. BUT THAT'S THE REALITY OF THIS PLACE I WOULD LIKE TO TO BE PURE AND WHAT HAVE YOU BUT I'VE COME TO UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE A NUMBER FORCES THAT AYE CONFLICT FIGHT AGAINST. WHEN I'VE GOT DIFFICULT BILLS ON THE FLOOR THAT A MORE THAN A COMMA AND SEMICOLON? AND AND SO. I DON'T KNOW ANYWAY IT'S JUST DIFFICULT FOR ME TO ENVISION FIVE YEARS WITHOUT A REAL PROBLEM AND AND I'M YOU KNOW AND I THINK THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER INDICATED THAT SHE IS WILLING TO TAKE AMENDMENTS TO REDUCE AT FIVE YOU RIGHT WE'RE GONNA MISTER MAYES NOW. THANK YOU SO OBVIOUSLY OF DEMOING TO SPEAK UP BUT DOCTOR WEBER INSPIRED ME TOO I KNOW WE'RE TRYING TO MOVE BILLS AND WE'VE GOT A WEDDING THAT'S A GOOD IDEA SO I SAW I'LL BE I'LL BE I'LL BE QUICK. YOU KNOW THAT THE I'M NOT GONNA SUPPORT THIS TODAY -- AN ACTUAL TELL YOU -- WHAT'S GOING ON IN MY HEAD -- AND HAVE HAS GONE ON IN MY HEAD -- A BEING SOMEBODY WHO STUDY POLITICAL SCIENCE TO OF THE DECIDED WHEN HE WAS TWENTY FOUR YEARS OLD TO RUN FOR POLITICAL OFFICE THINKING. OF THAT AT SOME POINT IN TIME -- I WANTED IT TO CONTINUE TO RUN. THERE ARE LOTS OF DIFFERENT THINGS THAT MOVE US AS ELECTED OFFICIALS ONE THING I'VE LEARNED SINCE I'VE I'VE BEEN HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE. IS THAT THE EIGHTEEN MET THE SEVEN NINE COLLEAGUES I HAVE IN THE ASSEMBLY THE OTHER FORTY AND THE SENATE ARE GOOD PEOPLE WE HAVE A LOT OF DIFFERENCES OF OPINION. I DON'T KNOW OF ANYBODY THAT GOT THAT RAN FOR OFFICE -- GOT ELECTED -- TO TRY TO MAKE A LIVING OUT OF OUT OF OUT OF SACRAMENTO -- BUT THE TRUTH IS THE TRUTH IS FOR PEOPLE LIKE ME WHO STUDIED POLITICAL SCIENCE AND WHO HAVE BEEN IN OF THE ELECTED OFFICE FOR SOME TIME I KNOW PUBLIC POLICY REALLY WELL IN FACT. I DON'T KNOW MUCH MORE OTHER THAN PUBLIC POLICY I GUESS I COULD GO BACK AND BE A FINANCIAL ADVISER I'M AT SOME POINT TIME BUT I THINK THE CURRENT RULES THAT WE HAVE THE HAVING THAT COOLING OFF PERIOD. OF ONE YEAR AFTER MAKES A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF SENSE AND I WOULD SUPPORT THAT THAT I THINK FIVE YEARS IS IS TOO LONG JUST TO MOVE A BILL TO COME UP WITH SOME OTHER. TIME FRAME I'M NOT SURE IS IS IMPORTANT HERE IS THE OTHER TRUTH I COULDN'T -- AFTER I WAS OUT OF THE THE THE THE THE OUT OF OFFICE I HAVE TO GET A JOB SEVEN OF MONEY BY NOT MONEY MY BANK ACCOUNT A TO BE ABLE. TO TO SURVIVE FOR A YEAR AND SO MOST OF US -- ARE GOING TO GO DO THAT WHEN WE'RE WHEN WE'RE DONE HERE -- I WOULD SAY AND I THINK THE BOB MAYES BILL OF THAT RANT WAS RAN BEFORE WAITING TILL AFTER -- OUR TERM OF OFFICE IS OUT FOR THAT YEAR TO START AT THE THAT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE BUT I THINK -- ANYTHING AFTER THAT IS -- IS JUST IS JUST TOO MUCH I THINK THAT THE CURRENT RULES ARE ARE FORGET IN. WESTERN GALLAGHER IS VERY VERY BRIEFLY I'LL I WOULD HOPE WE COULD SUPPORT THIS BILL TODAY I THINK'S ARE I THINK WE ALL KNOW THAT -- YOU KNOW. AT WE ALL LIKE EACH OTHER A LOT WE HAVE GREAT RELATIONSHIPS EACH OTHER BUT WE YOU KNOW IF IF THE ISSUE IS ONE THAT WE DISAGREE WITH. AND I DON'T CARE HOW MUCH I LIKE YOU AND YOU KNOW I'M STILL GO VOTE NO. AND AND AND I DO AND I DO. I VISIT FIRSTLY DISAGREE WITH THE WITH THE CONTENTION MADE ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED WITH THAT BILL. LAST YEAR WAS A LOT OF DIFFERENT REASONS IT WAS GOING INTO THAT DEBATE AND PEOPLE HAD VERY DIFFERENT REASONS FOR WHY THEY VOTED YES OR NO AND HAD. YEAH HENRY PRAYERS REALLY GOOD GUY BUT WE DON'T LIKE HIM THAT MUCH. I MEAN SO -- I MEAN. IS LIKE BUT I MEAN THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE ARE BRING ENOUGH BUT I JUST I I DON'T I DON'T THINK THAT THAT IS TRUE AT ALL THAT THAT'S WHY THAT BILL DIED OR ANY OF THOSE THINGS -- AND SO BUT I I DO THINK THAT THERE'S A THERE'S A LEGITIMATE. YOU KNOW ONE YEAR TURNAROUND YOU RESIGN AND WHEN YOUR TURN AROUND I MEAN. THERE'S SOMETHING THERE THAT MAYBE IT DOES NEED TO BE EXTENDED SO IT SOUNDS LIKE THE ASSEMBLY MEMBERS WANTED TO WORK ON THAT AND FIND WHAT IS THAT RIGHT TIMELINE I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING WE CAN ALL SUPPORT -- BECAUSE THE PUBLIC PERCEPTION IS IMPORTANT -- AND ENSURING THAT THERE IS SOME SEPARATION BEFORE SOMEONE'S BACK LOBBY IN THIS AGAIN SO. THE YOU MISTER CALDERON. Q. I APPRECIATE THE DISCUSSION OF REACH OUT TO YOUR OFFICE ALREADY HAD TO LET YOU KNOW MY POSITION ON THIS BILL -- I THINK A COUPLE THINGS NEED TO BE CLARIFIED IT IS IN ONE YEAR AFTER YOU RESIGNED. THE CURRENT LAW AND I DON'T THINK THAT BASED ON THE THE LAW THAT HAS BEEN PASSAGE. THERE REALLY ISN'T A LOT OF INFORMATION OUT THERE BUT IT'S SAY I TERM OUT WILL OKAY IT'S A YEAR AFTER I TURNED OUT THAT I CAN GO AND LOBBY IF THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO DO BUT IF I RESIGNED EARLY SAY I RESIGNED TODAY. IS IN IN NEXT APRIL THAT I CAN BECOME A LOBBYIST NO IT'S DECEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE THAT I WOULD BE ABLE TO BECOME A LOBBYIST BECAUSE IT STARTS AFTER THE TERM THAT I RESIGNED FROM ENDS. ARE ALSO THE INDIVIDUAL THAT WAS NAMED ALONG WITH THE OTHER INDIVIDUAL THAT'S BEEN TALKED ABOUT -- FROM THE OIL INDUSTRY THEY'RE NOT LOBBYIST AND THEY NEVER HAVE BEEN LOBBYIST. OUR AND THEIR NOT LOBBYING THE LEGISLATURE BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT REGISTERED LOBBYISTS ARE SO IT'S AN IMPORTANT DISTINCTION TO MAKE AS WELL AS THAT. YES IN INDIVIDUAL MAY HAVE RESIGNED BUT THEY DID RESIGNED TO BECOME A LOBBYIST OR LOBBYIST'S NOW YOUR LATER THEY'RE NOT LOBBYIST. AND THEY DO NOT LOBBY -- AND I AND I JUST. I I APPRECIATE AND RESPECT BILLS. THAT ARE MEANT TO KIND OF BEAT UP ON OURSELVES A LITTLE BIT IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW OUR MOTIVATIONS AND WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO WHAT WE USE THESE POSITIONS FOR AFTERWARDS BECAUSE I GET I GET THE CYNICISM OF GOVERNMENT. AND THE AND PEOPLE THAT ARE IN GOVERNMENT WHAT THEIR MOTIVATIONS ARE BUT I JUST WHOLEHEARTEDLY REJECT THIS IDEA THAT ANYTHING I DO RIGHT NOW IS PREDICATED UPON WHAT MY LIFE IS GOING TO BE. AFTER OR WHAT I'M DOING NOW WAS MOTIVATED BY WHAT MY LIFE WILL BE LIKE LATER TON OF PEOPLE CONTRIBUTE TO ALL OF OUR CAMPAIGNS. I DON'T AND I BOUGHT EVERY SINGLE DAY AGAINST PEOPLE THAT HAVE CONTRIBUTED MIKE TO MY CAMPAIGN THAT IS NOT WOULD DECIDE WHAT I DO WANT TO BILL AND WHAT I DO AFTER THIS HAS NO BEARING WHATSOEVER. ON ON YOU KNOW THE RELATIONSHIPS OR ANYTHING THAT I BUILT RIGHT NOW HASEVERYTHING TO DO WITH THIS JOB -- AND SO WHILE I APPRECIATE THESE TYPES OF MEASURES I JUST THINK IT'S IT'S KIND OF AN EASY THING TO DO. IT GETS A LOT OF PRESS THE LET THE PRESS LED TO TALK ABOUT BILLS THAT WE AUTHOR WE PASSED WE BEAT UP ON EACH OTHER. I I THINK THE CURRENT THE CURRENT LAWS ARE ARE ARE SUFFICIENT. AND WE ALSO HAVEN'T HAD ENOUGH TIME WITH THE CURRENT LAW TO MAKE ANY TYPE DETERMINATION WHETHER THAT THAT IS AN INSUFFICIENT OR NOT SO BECAUSE THAT RIGHT -- REASON I WON'T BE SUPPORT OF THE DAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- WITH THAT -- WE DON'T HAVE A MOTION OR A SECOND SO ALSO MOVED SO WE HAVE A MOTION WELL -- MR BERMAN SINCE OUR CHAIRMAN BERMAN EXCUSE ME SENSE -- THIS IS BEEN A LITTLE UNORTHODOX I'M USED TO CLOSING AND THEN GOING TO ABOUT NOT CLOSING AND THEN EVERYONE GETTING NOT RETUNING NEED TO COMMENT. SO IF YOU DON'T MIND IF I COULD JUST ADD A FEW -- I APPRECIATE -- EVERYONE'S OPINION THAT THEY'VE EXPECT THAT -- COMMUNICATED THIS MORNING I MUST SAY I'M A LITTLE TAKEN BY SURPRISE BECAUSE WE REACHED OUT TO EVERYONE'S OFFICE AND NO ONE COMMUNITY ANY OF THE COMMUNICATED ANY OF THESE CONCERNS. I'M A TO THIS POINT IN FACT A TIME LIMIT MAJOR OFFICE SAID THAT YOU WERE SUPPORTING THE BILL SIZE VERY SURPRISED THIS MORNING TO HEAR. ON THAT HE WAS NOT SO -- IF IF THERE IS INTEREST IN LOWERING. THE THRESHOLD TWO THREE YEARS OR TWO YEARS AS I'VE STATED BEFORE HIM I AM INTERESTED IN HAVING THAT COMMUTE THAT CONVERSATION NO ONE HAS ENGAGE IN THAT CONVERSATION. IF THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE WANT TODAY IN ORDER TO MOVE THE BILL FORWARD WE CAN AMEND THE BILL IN THE NEXT COMMITTEE TO WHATEVER'S AGREED UPON THIS MORNING BUT I THINK. IT SOUNDS LIKE WE ALL AGREE THAT WE DON'T WANT UNDUE INFLUENCE WERE PERHAPS A LITTLE BIT IN DISAGREEMENT A NUMBER OF YEARS SO I GUESS THAT'S MY QUESTION TO THE COMMITTEES IF. YOU'RE COMMITTED TO THIS IDEA ABOUT WANT TO SEE THE NUMBER CHANGED THEN HOW ABOUT WE AGREE UPON THAT NUMBER TODAY MOVE THE BILL FORWARD AN AMENDED IN THE NEXT COMMITTEE THANK YOU VERY MUCH IT LOOKS LIKE MR LOAD OF A COMMONER. YEAH YEAH IF I MIGHT MISTER HERE MY RIGHT NOW YOU'LL GET A CHANCE THERE. FOR AND THEN THAT'LL BE IT. I THINK IT I THINK I THAT EVERYONE GETS A CHANCE TO TALK I I I I APPRECIATED THE THE KNOWLEDGE IN IN TRYING. TO ADDRESS IN IT ACCOMMODATE THE UNDUE INFLUENCE BUT I CAN I I ALSO SIMILARLY TAKE RESERVATION TO THE NOTION. THAT. MEMBERS WHO WISH TO ADVOCATE AND LOBBY IS INHERENTLY BAD OR EVIL WITH A. B. FOR CYSTIC FIBROSIS OR CANCER SOCIETY THAT REPRESENTED FROM LEGAL AND VOTERS U. S. A. YOU MADE THE ASSUMPTION THAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT CORPORATIONS. ABOUT THIS IS DEMOCRACY IN ACTION AND WHAT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY AND THE THING THAT INDIVIDUAL THAT WE CARE ABOUT OR THOSE THAT ELECTED HIM BRING US HERE. AND WHICH WE GO BACK TO SEE THEM EVERY WEEKEND THERE ARE ALSO A NUMBER OF MEMBERS WHO FLY UP AND OF POSTED ABOUT THIS THAT LEAVE THEIR HOMES AT FOUR AM IN THE MORNING TO FLY UP HERE. ON THIS IS ABOUT DEDICATION OF WORK AND SO I THINK EVEN WHEN YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THE REQUIREMENTS AND THRESHOLD OF THAT OF A REGISTERED LOBBYIST. OF THAT OF ONE THIRD OF THAT WORK TO AN INDIVIDUAL A FORMER LEGISLATOR COULD STILL FUNCTION IN THIS CAPACITY SHOULD THEY NOT ADVOCATE OF FOR MORE THAN A THIRD OF THEIR TIME. SO I THINK WHEN WE TALKING ABOUT AS THE AUTHOR STATES IN A STATEMENT ABOUT THAT OF THE ON INTO INFLUENCE PERHAPS THEN WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THE TYPE OF COMPENSATION THAT WE REQUIRED SO WE CAN. PREVENT AS MUCH OF THE ONION TO INFLUENCE OR THE NOTION THAT IT AN INDIVIDUAL A LEGISLATIVE WE TRY TO SEEK HIGHER COMPENSATION IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR PERHAPS WE SHOULD COMPENSATE THEM WELL SO THAT THEY DON'T HAVE TO DO THAT. AND LEAVE THEIR FAMILIES AND NOT BE THE BREAD WINNER AT HOME SO I THINK THAT'S THE NOTION THAT WHICH WE WERE BUT TIME AND TAKE A LOOK AT AND AGAIN IT'S THE TO THE AUTHOR WHEN YOU SAID IT'S ABOUT THE TO THE TIME FRAME OF THE YEARS. MY FIRM FOR ME THIS IS NOT ABOUT THE NOTION OF JUST A BLANKET BAN I THINK WE'RE IF WE'RE REALLY TRYING TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE AT HAND. IT IS TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION ABOUT HOW WE CAN PROTECT THE THE PUBLIC INTEREST IN TERMS OF TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY. THANK YOU AND IT'S ARM ALIGNED AS YOU LIKE TO RESPOND OR ELSE. WELL I'LL JUST RESPOND BRIEFLY IN SAYING THAT I DON'T THINK ANYONE SITTING AT THIS TABLE SUGGESTED THAT THOSE WHO GO INTO LOBBYING ARE ARE ARE EVIL -- THAT'S YOU KNOW THAT IT'S IT'S I'M A PURPOSE. FOR IT'S A PROFESSION THAT MANY CHOOSE AND I'M NOT TRYING TO PREVENT ANYONE FROM GOING INTO THAT LINE OF WORK I JUST THINK THAT THE TIME FRAME OF THE COOLING OFF PERIOD -- IS APPROPRIATE I THINK EVERYONE OBVIOUSLY HAS A RIGHT TO GO MAKE A LIVING FOR THEIR FAMILY IN WHATEVER WAY THEY CHOOSE. BUT I DO THINK IT'S A PERFECT HAVE SOME SORT OF BUFFER IN BETWEEN THE TIME THEY WERE LEGISLATOR IN THE TIME THAT THEY ARE ABLE. TO INFLUENCE THE PEOPLE LIKE US -- HONOR BOTH WHETHER IT'S FOR THE AMERICAN CANCER SOCIETY OR IT'S FOR YOU KNOW A BIG OIL COMPANY -- BUT WITH THAT I WILL EXTEND MY QUESTION AGAIN WHICH IS IT IS IT IN THE INTEREST OF THIS COMMITTEE. TO MOVE THE BILL FORWARD WITH THE PROMISE THAT WE WILL LOWER THE THRESHOLD TO TWO YEARS OR THREE YEARS OR WHATEVER -- SEEMS TO BE THE CONSENSUS ON THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU THAT'S WHAT I HEARD A LOT OF WAS THE THANK YOU FOR THE PRESENTATION -- IT'S SO WITH RIGHT NOW THE BILL HAS A MOTION IT DOES NOT HAVE A SECOND WILL KEEP THE ITEM OPEN UNTIL THE END OF THE HEARING.

GALLAGHER NO CALDERON I DID NOT BE OF CALDERON. LOW. LOW ON MAYES. MAYES AYE MULLIN. WEBER. WEBER I THE BILL IS OUT ON A FIVE TO ONE VOTE WILL KEEP THE ROLE OPEN FOR ABSENT MEMBERS MOVING ON YOUR NEXT BILL SB SIX EIGHTY ONE ITEM NUMBER NINE THANK YOU. I'M REALLY MOTION. WE HAVE A SECOND. AB X. EIGHTY ONE IS JUST A MEASURE TO TRY -- TO CIRCUMVENT WHAT WE WHAT WE FOUND IN LAST PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION WHERE A LOT OF FOLKS DIDN'T UNDERSTAND IF YOU'RE NOT REGISTERED A CERTAIN PARTY YOU MAY NOT RECEIVE THE BALLOT THAT YOU THINK THAT YOU WANT TO VOTE IN. AND FOR EXAMPLE AT A NO PARTY PREFERENCE VOTER IN CALIFORNIA I'M CAN'T REQUESTED DEMOCRATIC -- BALLOT DATE WOULD HAVE TO RE REGISTER AS A REPUBLICAN TO GET A REPUBLICAN BALLOT IN THE PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY THIS TRIES TO INFORM THE MULTIPLE TIMES BY MULTIPLE METHODS THAT THIS IS HAPPENING SO WE DON'T HAVE. SOME SORT OF DISCONTENT THAT ODD THAT I DON'T KNOW YOU. THE FIGHT [inaudible] I JUST [inaudible] THAT'S COOL. IT I IT ALSO DEALS WITH THE SITUATION OF COURSE WE KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE HAVE REGISTERED AS AMERICAN INDEPENDENCE THINKING THAT THEY'RE NO PARTY PREFERENCE -- ALERTS THEM TO THAT ALERT THEM WHAT THEY NEED TO DO IN ORDER TO VOTE FOR THE PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY WHICH THEY'RE INTERESTED IN. WITH ME IS PAUL MITCHELL. WHO'S BEEN HOUNDING ME ABOUT THIS ISSUE FOR YEARS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- PAUL MITCHELL ON WITH POLITICAL DATE INCORPORATED AND THIS IS DEFINITELY A A A VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE BUT IT KIND OF GETS LOST BECAUSE WE ONLY THINK ABOUT IT EVERY FOUR YEARS AND IT'S SUCH A LITTLE KINDA NICHE THING. BUT THE STATE HAS AN OPEN DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY FOR PRESIDENT AND WE ALL KNOW THAT. BUT IT'S OPEN IN AIR QUOTES BECAUSE OF THE PROCESS. I IF YOU'RE A NON PARTISAN VOTER OR ACTUALLY. IT'S ACT WE CALLED IT. A PRIMARY QUALIFY DTS PQ DTS. I ANY NEW N. P. P. VOTER OR SOMEBODY WHO'S IN A IN A REGISTER OR IN A PART OF ITS NOT QUALIFIED LIKE IF YOUR REFORM PARTY MEMBER. OF YOU PUT BEACH PARTY OR PIRATE PARTY YOU WOULD BE ABLE TO VOTE IN THESE QUOTE UNQUOTE OPEN PRIMARIES. HOWEVER IF YOUR POLL VOTER IT'S PRETTY SIMPLE. YOU GO IN TO THE POLLING PLACE AND THEY OFFER YOU A PRESIDENTIAL BALLOT YOU TAKE IT YOU GO WITH THE WITH YOUR REGULAR ABOUT NEW VOTE. BUT IF YOU'RE A VOTE BY MAIL VOTER. IT ISN'T THAT EASY THEY HAVE TO MAIL YOU A LITTLE POSTCARD. AND YOU HAVE TO SIGN IT FOR YOU FILL IT OUT SIGN IT AND RETURN IT -- IT'S EVEN HARDER IN THIS TWENTY TWENTY ELECTION CYCLE BECAUSE OF THREE FACTORS. ONE IS THERE'S AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE REGISTERING NO PARTY PREFERENCE NOTABLY THOSE TO REGISTERING UNDER THE NEW AUTOMATIC VOTER REGISTRATION THE DMV MORE THAN HALF OF THEM ARE CHOOSING NO PARTY PREFERENCE. SECONDLY THERE'S MANY MANY MORE VOTE BY MAIL. SO TWO THIRDS OR MORE OF THE PEOPLE REGISTERED TO VOTE ONLINE OR REGINALD ABOUT AS VOTE BY MAIL. AND THIRD THE TIME FRAME. WE'RE GONNA HAVE A MARCH THIRD PRIMARY THAT MEANS BALLOTS HAVE TO BE MAILED FEBRUARY THIRD. THAT MEANS BALLOTS HAVE TO BE PUT TOGETHER BY THE COUNTY IS PREPARED FOR MAILINGS IN MID JANUARY. SO WHEN ARE THEY GONNA SEND OF THESE POSTCARDS. THEY'RE GONNA HAVE TO SELL THESE POSTCARDS UP POSTCARDS OVER THE HOLIDAYS THIS YEAR. SO YOU'RE GONNA BE PLANNING FOR THANKSGIVING CHRISTMAS FAMILY AND YOU GET WITH ALL THE JUNK MAIL YOU CAN GET LITTLE TINY POSTCARDS YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO FILL OUT AND RETURN. MOST VOTERS GET CONFUSED BY THIS PROCESS AND THE NUMBER HAS BEEN SKYROCKETING THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE IN THE SITUATION. SO THERE ARE FIVE POINT SEVEN NINE FIVE MILLION PRIMARY QUALIFIED TEACHERS VOTERS IN CALIFORNIA [inaudible] OF THOSE. IF YOU LOOK AT THOSE WHO ARE P. A. V. OR IN ONE OF THE NEW VOTE CENTER COUNTIES. THAT'S FOUR MILLION OF THEM SO IN COMPARISON. THERE WERE TWO MILLION VOTERS WHO IN THIS SITUATION BEING A VOTE BY MAIL AND A NON PARTISAN VOTER IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN THERE ONLY ONE MILLION OF THEM IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT AND THIS COMING ELECTION IN TWENTY TWENTY THERE'S GOING TO BE FOUR MILLION. OF THOSE FOUR MILLION HOW MANY OF EVER VOTED. IN A PRIMARY INTERPOSE EVENTUAL PRIMARY LESS THAN. NINE HUNDRED THOUSAND SO AND THE ON TOP OF THAT OVER ONE AND A HALF MILLION. OF THOSE FOUR MILLION VOTERS HAVE NEVER EVEN VOTED BY MAIL AT ALL IN ANY ELECTION. SO. IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN WE LOOK AT THIS ISSUE AND WE FOUND THAT DID NOT KNOW HOW TO GET THE ABSENTEE BALLOT THAT THEY'RE THE BALLOT THAT THEY WANTED -- WE FOUND THAT TWO THIRDS OF THE VOTERS SAID THEY WANTED TO VOTE IN THE DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY. YET. OVER A MILLION BALLOTS WERE RETURNED WITH NO PRESIDENTIAL RACE AT ALL ON THE BALLOT. REMEMBER IF YOU DON'T FILL OUT THE POSTCARD. YOU GET THE BALLOT AND IT HAS LEGISLATIVE AND CONGRESSIONAL AND BALLOT MEASURE IN CITY COUNCIL BUT THE PRESIDENTIAL SECTION IS BLANK. AND OVER A MILLION BALLOTS WERE RETURNED WITH A BLANK PRESIDENTIAL SECTION AND WE PULLED THEM AND FOUND THAT -- TO VOTE IN THE DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY IN. TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN BUT DIDN'T KNOW HOW. TO SO THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT VOTER DISENFRANCHISEMENT ISSUE WHERE IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN WE CAN SEE. THAT EVEN THOUGH THERE WAS HALF AS MANY VOTERS IN THE SITUATION FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE WERE DISENFRANCHISED BECAUSE OF THIS PROCESS SO WHAT THIS BILL ATTEMPTS TO DO IS BRING EDUCATION. TO THE PROCESS OF WHAT PARTY ARE YOU IN. WE CAN TALK FOREVER ABOUT THE AMERICAN INDEPENDENT PARTY IN THE CONFUSION THERE -- AND THE PROCESS FOR GETTING A BALLOT IF YOU WANT TO VOTE IN EITHER THE DEMOCRATIC OR REPUBLICAN PRIMARIES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. THE GUARDS OPEN [inaudible] I'M SORRY. ALL MY NAME IS CALLING BRITAIN I'M WITH THE ELECTION INTEGRITY PROJECT CALIFORNIA. AND WE SUPPORT THIS BILL IF AMENDED. AND I JUST WANT TO READ JUST VERY VERY CLEAR. VERY QUICKLY NAME AN ORGANIZATION OKAY. WE JUST URGE THAT THE BILL BE AMENDED. TO CHANGE THE MANDATED NUMBER OF VOTER NOTICES TO ONE CARD VERSUS THREE OF THREE IN IN SIXTY DAYS OF WE BELIEVE THAT ONE SENT BY MAIL IT WOULD BE SUFFICIENT. TO GROW EDUCATE SEVEN THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU VERY MUCH THAT WAS THE TWEEN AROUND AGAIN. WE'RE NOW WE'RE GOING TO WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. MY NAME IS ERIC HARRIS OF WITH DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ANYONE IS IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE TO BRING ABOUT A COLLEGE FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. SEEING NINE WE'VE GOT A MOTION AND A SECOND MAN. SOMEONE ORGANS ALL AS WE LIKE TO CLOSE. I A I DO WANT TO NOTE -- I ATE I DO PLAN TO AMEND THIS IN TWO WAYS I JUST WANT TO LET. ALL OF YOU KNOW IT AFTER TALKING TO MY REGISTER HE ASKED THAT I MOVED IT FROM NINETY DAYS TO A HUNDRED TWENTY DAYS IN ADVANCE -- TO TRULY PREPARE I HAVE ENOUGH TIME -- SO THAT THEY CAN START TO DO THAT AND IN DOING SO IT PUTS US AT A A POINT WHERE WE WILL OF COURSE HAVE TO ADDED URGENCY CLAUSE IN ORDER -- TO TO HAVE THE THE BILL IMPLEMENTED IN TIME -- I THINK IT'S SUCH A COMMONSENSE MEASURE -- AND I DO I HE POINTED OUT THAT THEY PULLED OUT ON THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT THEIR NUMBER OF INDEPENDENTS WHO DON'T REALIZE. THAT THEY WOULD HAVE TO RE REGISTER AS A REPUBLICAN ABOUT NOT PRIMARY I THINK THAT'S A POSITIVE FOR REPUBLICANS AS WELL AS WELL AND I'LL BE HONEST I MEAN PEOPLE DON'T LOVE THIS ON OUR SIDE BUT DISENFRANCHISES DEMOCRATS WHO WHO. IDENTIFY THEMSELVES AS REPUBLICANS IT WILL ALSO -- WHO ARE TRUMP SUPPORTERS IT IT WILL ALSO ALLOW THEM TO UNDERSTAND THAT THEY WON'T HAVE THAT ABILITY TO VOTE NOT ELECTION SO? I I THINK TRANSPARENCY IS GOOD I THINK TELLING VOTERS WHAT WHAT THEY SHOULD EXPECT IN AND HOW THEY SHOULD EXPECT IS GOOD IF IT BENEFITS US OF A BENEFITS OTHER FOLKS BUT THIS IS JUST ABOUT -- LETTING THEM KNOW HOW TO EXERCISE THE RIGHT TO VOTE SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU CAN YOU. DO TO THEIR TWO MOMENTS THAT YOU WERE PLANNING TO MAKE YOUR THE URGENCY CLASS. HAS OF THE ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY DAYS KNOWS THAT ONE GOTCHA -- GREAT NO THIS WAS AN ISSUE WHEN I WAS. FIRST RUNNING IN TALKING A LOT OF DOORS I HEARD A LOT OF CONFUSION FOR DTS VOTERS ABOUT THIS AND I DIDN'T FULLY UNDERSTAND THE ISSUE AND SO I WASN'T ABLE. TO TO KIND OF GIVE THEM GOOD GUIDANCE ON WHAT THEY NEED TO DO AND I THINK THIS WILL WILL HOPEFULLY -- KIND OF SOLVE A LOT OF FRUSTRATIONS THAT EXIST WITH A LOT OF VOTERS AND EDUCATE FOLKS ON ON WHAT THEY NEED TO DO TO TO HAVE THEIR VOICE HEARD TO REALLY APPRECIATE THE BILL WITH THAT -- HAPPY TO MAKING MY RECOMMENDATION AMOUNT OF SECRETARY PLEASE CALL VOTE.

OUR TEAM WORKS TO ENSURE THAT HISTORICALLY DISENFRANCHISED UNDER PARTICIPATING COMMUNITIES ARE ABLE TO ACCESS OUR DEMOCRACY. CALIFORNIA CONTINUES TO SEE SEVERE AND PERSISTENT VOTER PARTICIPATION DISPARITIES -- IN CALIFORNIA'S TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN GENERAL ELECTION OF ELIGIBLE ASIAN AMERICANS JUST JUST 36% VOTED OF ALL OTHERS OVER 61% VOTED. SHOCKINGLY THESE VOTER PARTICIPATION DISPARITIES ARE ACTUALLY WORSE THAN THE DISPARITIES WE SAW TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN WE PASSED AUTOMATIC VOTER REGISTRATION PARTIAL SAME DAY VOTER REGISTRATION PRE REGISTRATION OF SIXTEEN TO SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD. THESE ARE ALL EXCELLENT BILLS AND THEY HELP DRIVE UP TURN OUT IN. TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN UNFORTUNATELY WHAT WE SAW WAS THAT VOTER PARTICIPATION AMONG ASIAN AMERICANS LATINOS ONE UP LESS THAN ELECTED AT LARGE WHICH MEANT THAT TURNOUT DISPARITIES GOT BIGGER.

FOR NON ENGLISH SPEAKING VOTERS TO ACCESS THE TRANSLATOR MATERIALS TO WHICH THEY ARE ENTITLED UNDER LAW AND WHICH COUNTY ELECTIONS OFFICIALS ARE EXPENDING GREAT EXPENSE AND TIME IN ACTUALLY MAKING. BUT ARE BEING REQUESTED A DRAMATICALLY LOWER RATES -- ONLY THE STATE'S VOTER REGISTRATION DATABASE HAVE A LANGUAGE PREFERENCE IDENTIFIED FOR SOMETHING OTHER THAN ENGLISH JUST 3%. THIS IS TRUE DESPITE THE FACT IT UP CITIZENS OF VOTING AGE IN CALIFORNIA. 35% SPEAK A LANGUAGE OTHER THAN ENGLISH AT HOME FOLKS ARE NOT X.

VERY EXCITED TO ATTEND OUR EVENT AND SHE EVEN BROUGHT ADDITIONAL VOTERS WITH HER. SHE BOTTOM BECAUSE SHE HAD NEVER REALLY VOTED FOR ANY OF THE BALLOT MEASURES IN THE PAST BECAUSE SHE DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THEM AND SHE WAS SCARED TO VOTE FOR SOMETHING THAT WOULD HARM HER FAMILY.

ALAS SESSION I WAS HAPPY TO SUPPORT THIS AUTHORS EFFORTS TO IMPROVE THE AVAILABILITY OF TRANSLATED VOTING MATERIALS FOR CALIFORNIA'S LANGUAGE MINORITY COMMUNITIES. THIS BILL TAKES AN IMPORTANT NEXT STEP TO IMPROVE OPPORTUNITIES FOR VOTERS TO REQUEST BALLOT MATERIALS IN LANGUAGES OTHER THAN ENGLISH. A SO I'M RECOMMENDING SUPPORT WITH THE TECHNICAL AMENDMENT THAT IT HAS BEEN ACCEPTED BY THE AUTHOR -- WITH THAT MA'AM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL VOTE THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED AND RE REFER TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS BERMAN. BERMAN I GALLAGHER. CALDERON CALDERON I'D LOW. WELL I'D MAYES. MAYES I'M MULLIN [inaudible] WEBER [inaudible] I THAT'S OUT ON A FIVE OVER WILL KEEP THE ROLE OPEN FOR ABSENT MEMBERS THANK YOU VERY MUCH IF YOU'D LIKE TO MOVE ON TO ITEM NUMBER TWELVE AB. EIGHT FORTY NINE YES PLEASE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR COLLEAGUES IN STAFF I AM ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS RECOMMENDED IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS ON AB EIGHT FORTY NINE THANK YOU FOR THOSE. AND ALSO BE TAKEN SOME ADDITIONAL AMENDMENTS RESPONSIVE TO SOME OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE CONCERNS I'VE HEARD RAISED BY THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT ASSOCIATIONS INCLUDING REDUCING THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF HEARINGS FROM. TEN TO SIX ONLY APPLY THE NEW PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT REQUIREMENTS OF THE REDISTRICTING CONTEXT AND SCALING BACK SOME OF THE HEARING ACCESSIBILITY. REQUIREMENTS. REDISTRICTING IS OF CRUCIAL IMPORTANCE TO LOCAL DEMOCRACY HOW LOCAL GOVERNMENT ELECTION DISTRICTS ARE DRAWN CAN HELP DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT A COMMUNITY WILL BE FAIRLY REPRESENTED. AT THEIR MOST INTIMATE AND CLOSEST LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT. UNLIKE STATE LEVEL REDISTRICTING THERE ARE VERY FEW REQUIREMENTS GOVERNING LOCAL REDISTRICTING TO ENSURE THE PROCESS IS FAIR AND TRANSPARENT. AND THAT THE PUBLIC AND ESPECIALLY UNDER REPRESENTED COMMUNITIES ARE ENGAGED IN THE PROCESS CURRENTLY LOCAL DISTRICT MAPS CAN BE DRAFTED THEN INTRODUCED AND ADOPTED AT THE SAME MEETING WITHOUT FIRST BEING PUBLISHED AND SHARED. WITH THE PUBLIC ADDITIONALLY THERE IS NO PUBLIC OUTREACH REQUIREMENT INCLUDING TO NON ENGLISH SPEAKING COMMUNITIES WERE LESS LIKELY TO BE AWARE. OF THE PROCESS THE CURRENT LAW UNDERMINES THE GOAL OF FAIR REPRESENTATION AB EIGHT FORTY NINE WILL BRING TRANSPARENCY AND CREEK CLEAR STANDARDS THAT WOULD BE SIMILAR TO THOSE OF STATE AND CONGRESSIONAL. REDISTRICTING REQUIREMENTS I'M COMMITTED TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH STAKEHOLDERS TO ENSURE THAT WE STRUCK THE RIGHT BALANCE HERE BETWEEN COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT AND TRANSPARENCY. THANK YOU MEMBERS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE I HAVE WITH ME NICHOLAS HEIGHT ONE POLICY AND LEGAL DIRECTOR OF COMMON CAUSE CALIFORNIA AS WELL. AS JONATHAN STEIN ONCE AGAIN HAD A VOTING RIGHTS AND SENSES PROGRAMS THAT ASIAN AMERICANS ADVANCING JUSTICE THANK YOU VERY MUCH RESPOND AND JUST CLARIFICATION THE MEMONS WILL BE TAKEN IN THE NEXT COMMITTEE BECAUSE OF TIMING ISSUES. THANK YOU FOR FOR AGREEING TO ACCEPT THE AMENDMENTS IN THE NEXT COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR YOUR HELP OUT WITH THEM AND APPRECIATE CLARIFICATION BRIDGET THANKS PLEASE. CHAIR BERMAN MEMBERS NICKEL SIDE ON WITH CALIFORNIA COMMON CAUSE. FAIR REDISTRICTING IS CRUCIAL AT ALL LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT TO ENSURE A REPRESENTATIVE AND INCLUSIVE DEMOCRACY. IS PRO TRUST IN THE FAIRNESS WERE SYSTEM. IT IS HARD TO UNDERSTATE THE IMPORTANCE OF REDUCING WHEN THE PROCESS IS MISUSED A CAN OF THE PRACTICAL EFFECT. OF DEPRIVING COMMUNITIES OF VOICE IN GOVERNMENT FOR AN ENTIRE DECADE. THE GOOD NEWS IS A WHEN IT COMES TO STATE AND CONGRESSIONAL REDUCING CALIFORNIA'S THE NATIONAL MODEL. THE STATE'S CITIZENS REDUCING COMMISSION AS A TRANSPARENT PROCESS COMMITMENTS PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT AND APPLIES FAIR IN CLEAR CRITERIA. HOWEVER MANY OF THESE PROTECTIONS ARE LACKING AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. FOR EXAMPLE UNLIKE FOR STATE AND CONGRESSIONAL REDISTRICTING THERE'S NO REQUIREMENT FOR LOCAL REDUCING. THE COMMUNITIES AND NEIGHBORHOODS BE CAPS HOLE. IN FACT OTHER THAN FEDERAL REQUIREMENT OF EQUAL POPULATION AND YOU'RE A COMPLAINTS THERE NO MANDATORY STANDARDS AT ALL FOR LOCAL REDUCING JUST DISCRETIONARY CONSIDERATIONS THE CAN BE IGNORED. AND WHERE IS A STATE COMMISSION GAUGES AND AN EXTENSIVE HEARING PROCESS STATE LAW REQUIRES LOCAL GOVERNMENTS JUST HOLD ONE PUBLIC HEARING PRIOR TO ADOPTING MAPS AND NO PUBLIC OUT REQUIREMENTS. AS A RESULT. MANY COMMUNITIES AND ESPECIALLY ALREADY UNDER REPRESENTED COMMUNITIES OFTEN FAILED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE REDUCING PROCESS. YOU MAY NOT EVEN BE AWARE THAT IT IS OCCURRING. TAKEN TOGETHER THIS PROVIDES A LITTLE ONLY A LITTLE SAFETYNET AGAINST EXTREME GERRYMANDERING AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. FOR EXAMPLE I LIKE TO THE COMMITTEE -- THIS MAP WHICH IS THE COUNCIL DISTRICTS OF THE CITY MARTINEZ WHICH I BELIEVE ILLUSTRATES THIS POINT. PROTECTING COMMENTS FOUR OF WHOM LIVE NEAR EACH OTHER THE COUNCIL DO SKINNY AND CONTORTED NORTH SOUTH DISTRICTS. CRACKING NEIGHBORHOODS AND COMMUNITIES WITH ALMOST COMPLETE DISREGARD. THIS INVERTS VERY PURPOSE THREE DISTINCT RIGHT FAIR REPRESENTATION TOLL PEOPLE. INSTEAD MAKES THE PROCESS JUST A TOOL DOUBLE STRING COMMENTS THANK YOU. THE SPLITTING OF NEIGHBORHOODS AND COMMUNITIES ITSELF A PROBLEM ALSO CONTRIBUTES THE STARK UNDER REPRESENTATION OF RACIAL MINORITIES IN CALIFORNIA LOCAL GOVERNMENT. IN THE LAST CYCLE SO RICH ORGANIZATIONS REPEATEDLY OBJECTED TO MINORITY COMMUNITIES BEING SPLIT THREE DISTINCT INCLUDING AND COUNTIES LIKE LOS ANGELES SAN BERN DINO ORANGE INTO LAURIE. CITIES LIKE LONG BEACH OAKLAND PLACENTIA IN SACRAMENTO AND SCHOOL DISTRICTS LIKE KERN HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICT. REDUCING HAS ALSO BEEN ABUSED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL TO DISENFRANCHISE VOTERS BASED ON THEIR PARTY AFFILIATION. AFFECTING PEOPLE OF BOTH PARTIES. AB EIGHT FOUR NINE THE FARM OUTSIDE TO STRENGTHENS LOCAL REDUCING PROCESS AGAINST THESE PIECES IN TWO KEY WAYS FIRST. REFORMS A CRITERIA FOR LOWER DISTRICT TO MINIMIZE POSSIBILITY GERRYMANDERING THOSE HOUSES MANDATORY RANK CRITERIA. MODEL CLOSELY OFF OF THE STATE CRITERIA. SO THE KEEPING NEIGHBORHOODS AND COMMUNITIES WILL BE PRIORITIZED THE BILL ALSO FOR THE FIRST TIME PROHIBITS PARTISAN GERRYMANDERING AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. FINALLY AB EIGHT FOUR NINE ALSO PROVIDES IMPORTANT PROCEDURAL AND TRANSPARENCY SAFEGUARDS SO THE PUBLIC CAN BETTER PARTICIPATE IN THE LOCAL PROCESS. THIS INCLUDES REQUIRING MINIMUM FOR HEARINGS BEFORE MAP CAN BE APPROVED NO PART OF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ENGAGING COMMUNITY OUTREACH SO DIVERSE COMMUNITIES INCLUDING NON ENGLISH SPEAKING CHINESE COMPRESS SPATE. TOGETHER THESE CHANGES PROPOSED MAYBE A POINT ON WILL CONTRIBUTE TO MORE REPRESENTATIVE INCLUSIVE IN ACCOUNTABLE LOCAL MOXIE AND WE ARE. WE URGE AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU IF YOU. MY NAME IS JONATHAN STEIN AGAIN I HAD THE VOTING RIGHTS AND SENSES PROGRAMS THAT ASIAN AMERICANS ADVANCING JUSTICE ASIAN LAW CAUCUS I'D LIKE TO SPEAK TO THE COMMUNITY EDUCATION AND PUBLIC PARTICIPATION PARTS OF THE BILL. WHAT THIS BILL DOES IN THE BROADEST POSSIBLE SENSE IS GIVES HISTORICALLY DISENFRANCHISED COMMUNITIES THAT BEEN LEFT OUT OF OUR DEMOCRACY A FIGHTING CHANCE I LIKE TO SHARE STORIES? IN A CITY SHIFT FROM OUT LARGE DISTRICT ELECTIONS THAT REQUIRED HOLD FOR PUBLIC HEARINGS THE CITY OF FREMONT GOTTA CBRE NOTICED LETTER AND BEGIN TO CHIP THE DISTRICTS. WE FOUND OUT ABOUT IT AFTER TWO HEARINGS HAVE BEEN COMPLETED AND DRAFT MAPS THAT ARE THE PUBLIC. FREMONT IS HOME TO THE LARGEST AFGHAN POPULATION OUTSIDE OF AFGHANISTAN IS FAMOUS ACROSS THE AFGHAN DIASPORA WORLDWIDE. AND YET BECAUSE THE AFGHAN COMMUNITY HAS NO VOICE IN CITY POLITICS NO AFGHANS HAVE BEEN CONSULTED IN THE DRAWING OF MAPS AND THAT SPLIT THE AFGHAN CULTURAL AND COMMERCIAL HUB INTO TWO DISTRICTS OR THREE DISTRICTS DEPENDING ON THE MAP. WE BROUGHT INTO THE COMMUNITY TEACHING AFTER A COMMUNITY MEMBERS ABOUT DISTRICTS HELPING THE MAP THEIR COMMUNITY AND PREPARE THEM TO STEP FORWARD AND PROVIDE TESTIMONY. IN THE FIRST TWO HEARINGS NEVER ZERO AFGHANS PRESENT FOR THE LAST TWO AFGHANS OVER HALF OF THE SPEAKERS NONE OF THEM EVER SPEAK INTO THE CITY COUNCIL. FOR EACH SPOKE PASSIONATELY SOMETIMES THE TRANSLATOR BUT HOW IMPORTANT FREMONT LOS THE AFGHAN COMMUNITY AND HOW IMPORTANT AFTER A COMMUNITY WHAT'S THE FREMONT. THIS BOOK ABOUT FINDING A NEW HOME AFTER LEAVING ONE TORN BY WAR. WE SPOKE ABOUT WANTING TO FEEL VALUED LISTEN. TO ONE WOMAN IN BROKEN ENGLISH THANK THE CITY COUNCIL PER SERVING THE CITY AND SAID THAT SOMEDAY SHE HELPED HER SON WHO'S GETTING GREAT GRADES IN SCHOOL WOULD SOME DAY BE THE MAYOR OF FREMONT. LONG STORY SHORT THE MAPS REDRAWN AND THE AFGHAN CULTURE BECAUSE COMMERCIAL HUB WAS KEPT TOGETHER IT WAS A VICTORY FOR REPRESENTATION AND FOR DEMOCRACY. BUT HERE'S THE THING NO ONE OTHER THAN US REACHED OUT TO THE AFGHAN COMMUTING TOLD IN THIS PROCESS WAS HAPPENING IF WE HADN'T DONE THAT THAT VICTORY WOULD HAVE HAPPENED. IS A WORKING PEOPLE THEY CAN'T TAKE TIME OFF IF THOSE MEETINGS HAVE BEEN HELD AT NIGHT THIS VICTORY WHAT HAPPENED. THERE WERE NO TRANSLATORS ON HAND IF COMMUNITY MEMBERS HAD BEEN WILLING TO TRANSLATE THAT VICTOR WOULD HAVE HAPPENED. IT TOOK TIME TO ORGANIZE TO EDUCATE TO MOBILIZE IF THERE'D BEEN JUST ONE HEARING THAT BACK VICTORY WOULDN'T OF HAPPENED. IT FREMONT LITERALLY EVERYTHING WENT RIGHT IF ONE THING HADN'T A COMMUNITY HAS ALREADY LEFT OUT OF LOCAL DEMOCRACY WITHIN SLICED AND DICED IN THE DISTRICT IN PROCESS. THE PURPOSE OF THIS BILL IS TO CREATE A LOCAL REDISTRICTING PROCESS WHERE THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN WE'RE COMMUNITIES HAVE A FIGHTING CHANCE TO MAKE THEMSELVES HEARD. I KNOW SOME LOCAL JURISDICTIONS MAY SEE THE REQUIREMENTS FOR ADDITIONAL HEARINGS FOR DOING OUTREACH AND PROVIDING TRANSLATORS AS BURDENSOME. BUT WITHOUT THOSE THINGS CONSIDER THE BURDEN PLACED ON OUR COMMUNITIES. LIVING UNDER DEMOCRATIC SYSTEMS THAT DON'T REPRESENT THEM THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND THEIR NEEDS THEY DON'T LOOK AT THE COMMUNITIES THE MEANT TO SERVE. AND LIVING AS AN AFTERTHOUGHT IN YOUR OWN LOCAL DEMOCRACY FOR A TEN YEAR REDISTRICTING CYCLE THAT IS BURDENSOME. VOTE YES ON A. B.

YOU KNOW AND I I THINK I YOU KNOW ON A BROADER SCALE AND I'VE I'VE EXPRESSED THIS PRETTY DIRECTLY TO THE SPONSORS THIS BILL WE HAVE WORK -- TO IN IN CONCERT WITH THE BOAT PEOPLE THEY'RE SITTING AT THIS TABLE THEY'VE SPOKEN AT OUR CONFERENCES THEY'VE SPOKEN. YOU KNOW AT TO TO OUR MEMBERS ARE WORKING TOGETHER TO TRY TO FIND YOU KNOW MEAN FOR SOLUTIONS TO ENGAGE VOTERS -- AND WITH SIXTY PAGES OF AMENDMENTS I THINK IT DROPPED INTO A MEASURE THAT AFFECTS EVERY ASPECT OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT I THINK THE NARRATIVE THAT THAT IT CLEARLY SUPPORT ABOUT THE TESTIMONY IS THAT. LOCAL JURISDICTIONS ARE ACTIVELY TRYING TO JERRY MANDER THEY'RE ACTIVELY TRYING TO DISENFRANCHISE VOTERS AND I WOULD REMIND AT ALL BUT ONE MEMBER OF THIS COMMITTEE SERVED IN A AND A CAPACITY OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT. I WOULD ASK THAT YOU TAKE THAT IN CONSIDERATION WHEN YOU'RE THINKING OF THE FACT THAT ARE WE ACTIVELY TRYING -- TO SUPPRESS VOTING I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT IS THAT TO BE THE CASE IN CALIFORNIA GIVEN THAT WE ARE -- THE REALLY THE MODEL OF DEMOCRACY MOVING FORWARD SO -- WITH THAT -- THE BECAUSE IT IS DOES OPPOSED MEASURE THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH. CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE DON'T GIVENS WITH THE CALIFORNIA SPECIAL DISTRICTS ASSOCIATION OPPOSITION OF THIS MEASURE. WE BELIEVE THIS IS A MOSTLY ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH TO ALL PUBLIC AGENCIES AND I THINK THAT IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE WE LOOK AT WHO THIS IS APPLYING TO IN. AND IN PARTICULAR HOW TO APPLYING TO THE SPECIAL DISTRICTS -- THERE ARE JUST FOR THE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE. THERE ARE THREE HUNDRED AND TWENTY NINE SPECIAL DISTRICTS REPRESENTED. BY THE BY THIS COMMITTEE THERE OVER TWO THOUSAND SPECIAL DISTRICTS IN THE STATE. NOW WHILE MOST OF THEM ARE CURRENTLY NOT HAVING BY DISTRICT ELECTIONS THAT NUMBER IS RAPIDLY CHANGING IN RESPONSE TO THE CVR A LAWSUIT SO WHILE A IT'S PROBABLY LESS THAN HALF NOW IT'S GOING TO BE IT. I I DID I THINK AT SOME POINT WE'RE GONNA HAVE ALMOST ALL OF OF OUR OUR DISTRICTS RANGE IN SIZE FROM -- THEY THEY COVERED MULTIPLE CITIES TO WORK -- TWO SQUARE MILES OR GO OVER TWO OR THREE DIFFERENT COUNTY LINES. YOU FOR THE JUST FOR THE DISTRICTS THAT ARE WITHIN REPRESENTING THIS COMMITTEE THAT WOULD BE AT THE MINIMUM OF FOUR MEETINGS FOR THE THREE HUNDRED TWENTY NINE DISTRICTS THAT'S ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTEEN PUBLIC OUTREACH MEETINGS. AND THAT'S JUST FOR SPECIAL DISTRICTS THAT DOES NOT INCLUDE ALL THE CITIES THAT ARE WITHIN YOUR YOUR JURISDICTIONS OR THE COUNTIES. AND AND AND THIS IS NOW SENATE SOMEHOW BRING IN THE PUBLIC TO BE MORE ENGAGED IN THE THE DISTRICTING LINES FOR THEIR WATER DISTRICT. FOR THEIR UTILITY DISTRICT SPECIAL DISTRICTS -- TYPICALLY PROVIDING ONE SINGULAR SERVICE WHAT THE RESIDENTS TYPICALLY CARE ABOUT -- FROM THEIR FROM THEIR ELECTED OFFICIALS IS VIEWED AS A POWER TURNOUT. DOES THE WATER WORK. IT IT'S NOT IT'S NOT AN ISSUE OF I MEAN THESE ARE NONPARTISAN ELECTIONS THERE THERE ARE DIFFERENT THAN STATE AND CONGRESSIONAL. RACES WITH THE WE'RE WE'RE NOT DRAWING LINES TO TRY AND HAVE REPUBLICANS BECAUSE WE'RE NONPARTISAN. IT'S AGAIN TO THE WATER TURNOUT DISEASE DOES YOUR UTILITY WORK -- IT WILL INITIALLY THIS IS GOING TO HAVE SIGNIFICANT UNFUNDED MANDATE. COST TO OUR PUBLIC AGENCIES MANY OF ART SPECIAL DISTRICTS ARE EVEN ELIGIBLE FOR REIMBURSEMENT THROUGH THE THROUGH THE MANDATE PROCESS AT THE COMMISSION ITS STATE MANDATES. SO THESE ARE SIGNIFICANT COSTS THAT WILL BE PASSED ON TO RESIDENTS DOESN'T MATTER WHAT THEIR HOW MUCH MONEY THEY MAKE THEIR FEES MAY HAVE TO GO UP JUST TO PAY THE WATER BILL OR THEIR UTILITY BILL -- FOR THOSE REASONS WERE POSES MEASURE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS JEAN HEARST HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE URBAN COUNTIES OF CALIFORNIA AND THE RURAL COUNTY REPRESENTATIVES OF CALIFORNIA. ARE WITH AN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION AS COUNTY GOVERNMENTS WHO. RUN LOCAL ELECTIONS AND ARE VERY FAMILIAR WITH THAT -- REIMBURSEMENT PROCESS WE HAVE SORT OF THE UNIQUE. ROLE IN SORT OF BRINGING UP THE ISSUE OF THE COST OF THIS. THE MANDATE PROPOSED BY AB. EIGHT FORTY NINE WE ARE VERY FAMILIAR WITH THE PRACTICE OF REQUIRING LOCAL AGENCIES TO DO NEW AND HIGHER LEVELS OF SERVICE IN ELECTIONS AND THEN THOSE MANDATES GET SUSPENDED RESULTING IN A NO FUNDING AT THE LOCAL LEVEL OR THE CHOICE. TO STOP PROVIDING THIS SERVICE OBVIOUSLY IN ELECTIONS THAT'S VERY DIFFICULT OUR ELECTIONS OFFICIALS IN OUR COUNTY LEADERS DON'T REALLY WANT TO GO DOWN THAT PATH -- YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT SOME OF THE PRACTICAL COMPLEXITIES WE CERTAINLY AGREE WITH OUR COLLEAGUES ON THOSE BUT WE REALLY WANT TO ENCOURAGE YOU TO CONSIDER. THE COST OF IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS MEASURE AS OF THIS BILL IS CONSIDERED BY THIS COMMITTEE -- AND AGAIN WE HAVE -- AND OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION COMMITTED TO CONTINUE THE DIALOGUE BUT VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE COST. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES OPPOSITION. JEFF NEAL WITH THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES ONE ASSOCIATE MYSELF WITH THE OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION MY COLLEAGUE TING THANK YOU. THOROUGHBRED ON BEHALF OF THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA HEALTHCARE DISTRICTS WOULD ALIGN OUR COMMENTS WITH THOSE OF OUR COLLEAGUE FROM THE SPECIAL DISTRICTS ASSOCIATION THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ANY ADDITIONAL WHEN THIS IS IN OPPOSITION SING NONE BRING IT BACK TO COLLEGE FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS OR MOTIONS OR SECONDS MISTER MISS. I'M JUST GOING TO AGAIN FOR BREVITY'S SAKE JUST TO ALIGN MYSELF WITH US SOME OF THE AT THE OPPONENTS -- THE COMMENTS -- I AT ONE POINT TIME IN TWENTY GUESSES TWENTY ELEVEN I WORKED FOR A COUNTY SUPERVISOR AND SAM YOU COUNTY AND WE ACTUALLY BUT A LOT OF TIME. A DRAWING THE LINES DECEMBER YOU KNOW COUNTY -- AND IT'S INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT WHEN YOU'RE WHEN YOU'RE DOING THAT I DO THINK THAT THIS IS A LOCAL A LOCAL CONTROL ISSUE IN JUST LET MY COMMENTS WITH THEM ABOUT THE OPPOSITION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH [inaudible] NEED ADDITIONAL. COMMENTS FROM ANY COLLEAGUES. DR WEBER. I WANT TO OF THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AS I THINK -- AND I'M I DIDN'T GET THE ORGANIZATION YOU WITH THE CALIFORNIA SPECIAL DISTRICTS ASSOCIATION RIGHT OKAY. BOB AND I I SAY THIS BECAUSE I THINK. OFTENTIMES THERE'S A PERSPECTIVE THAT EVERYTHING IS GOING WELL. AND THAT EVERYBODY'S HAPPY AND UNTIL YOU GET TO DIFFERENT GROUPS THAT ARE SMALLER DO YOU REALIZE THAT EVERYBODY'S NOT HAPPY THOSE WHO GENERALLY ON THE BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS AND RUN AND THINGS ARE VERY HAPPY. WITH WHAT HAPPENS THEY THINK IT'S VERY FAIR VERY HONEST THEY EITHER IN SAN DIEGO THEY HAD WE HAD JUDGES WHO WOULD BASICALLY DOING THIS. AND AND IT ENDED YOU KNOW WHEN YOU GET DOWN TO THE LEVEL FOLKS THEY WERE SAYING YOU KNOW OUR COMMUNITIES HAVE BEEN DIVIDED WE HAVEN'T HAD BEEN HURT WE DON'T KNOW YOU KNOW ON AND ON AND ON AND SO. IF YOU'RE NOT A PART OF IT THEN YOU DON'T REALIZE YOU KNOW THAT THAT THAT THERE THERE'S THIS THIS THING GOING ON AND MANY OF OUR SPECIAL DISTRICTS PARTICULAR HOSPITAL DISTRICTS. OF OF FOLKS DON'T EVEN KNOW THEY EXIST -- AT LEAST I DISCOVERED IN IN SAN DIEGO THAT SOME OF THEM BOB AND YET THEY'RE MAKING MAJOR DECISIONS ABOUT HEALTHCARE IN COMMUNITIES AND WHO'S BEING SERVED WHO'S NOT BEING SIR. SO THE HEALTHCARE DISTRICT IN SAN DIEGO NOW PEOPLE GOES MY PARTICULARLY THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE RAISING ISSUES THAT ARE COMING FORTH BUT MOST COMMUNITY FOLKS HAVE NO IDEA BECAUSE OF THE WAY THE DISTRICTS THE THE STRUCTURE. OR HOW THEY DO THE BUSINESS THEY DO THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW THEY EXIST SO I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT -- THAT -- THAT WE DO OPEN UP THIS WHOLE AREA BECAUSE THERE ARE MANY MANY COMMUNITIES THAT ARE OF A SPLIT AND I HAVE SOME THAT A SPLIT AND DIVIDED IN VARIOUS WAYS. AND IT DOES MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR THOSE COMMUNITIES TO EVEN JUST TO ACCESS THEIR ELECTED OFFICIALS SOMETIMES PEOPLE SAY WELL YOU'RE VERY FORTUNATE TO HAVE THREE ELECTED OFFICIAL WANT TO TALK TO THREE ELECTED. ME YEAH IF YOU HAVE NOTHING ELSE TO DO BUT IF YOU KNOW. THE WHOLE IDEA OF IT THEY HAD YOUR YOUR YOUR POWER HAS BEEN DIVIDED UP SO YOU THINK YOU HAVE THREE REPRESENT IS WHAT YOU REALLY DON'T BECAUSE OF THE WEIGHT OF THE OF OF THE THE COLLECTIVE IS NOT THERE AND SO TRYING TO FIGURE OUT. HOW YOU DO IT AND I KNOW IT'S DIFFICULT AND IS EXPENSIVE AND DEMOCRACY ALWAYS TAKES MORE TIME THAT WE WANT TO GIVE? UP BUT I THINK THERE'S SOME VALUE AND IT'S OUR I REALLY RESPECT YOUR COMMENTS BECAUSE I KNOW IT'S HARD. WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO MANAGE ALL THESE THINGS IN TRYING TO GET THINGS GOING AT IT IT REQUIRES MORE RESOURCES AND WHAT TIME BUT AT THE SAME TIME THOSE THE TO GET PEOPLE INVOLVED AND ENGAGED -- IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT SO THAT UP THOSE ENTITIES HAVE A LOT MORE -- OF PARTICIPATION I THINK BUT THE GENERAL PUBLIC IN THAT SENSE SO I EXT. THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL AS WE MOVE FORWARD. SECOND HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND. ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. MS ONE WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE IT JUST SUPER QUICKLY I APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS OF THE OPPOSITION AND WE WILLCONTINUE TO WORK WITH THEM TO TRY TO STRIKE THE RIGHT BALANCE HERE WE'RE NOT TRYING TO IMPOSE ANY UNNECESSARY. WORK OR BURDEN WHAT EVERYTHING THAT WE ASK OUR LOCAL DISTRICTS AND LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO DO IN THIS REGARD TO HAVE VALUE. AND WE'RE TRYING TO FIND WAYS TO BE EFFICIENT. FOR EXAMPLE ALLOWING THE HEARINGS TO BE CONSOLIDATED WITH ALREADY SCHEDULED MEETINGS SO THAT YOU DON'T HAVE A SEPARATE MEETING BUT YOU CAN JUST INCORPORATED AS AN AGENDA ITEM AT A TIME CERTAIN DURING. AN EXISTING MEETING WE THINK THAT'S PRACTICAL THAT THAT'S HELPFUL -- I ALSO DON'T THINK IT'S NECESSARY OR PRODUCTIVE TO GET IN INTO INTENTIONS OF OF WHAT ANY CITY COUNCIL OR JURISDICTION HAS HAS. INTEND TO DO OR NOT DO. YOU KNOW I'LL ALWAYS HAVE GOOD INTENTIONS BUT I ALSO NEED TO LOOK AT THE OUTCOMES AND THE OUTCOMES ARE ARE ARE NOT ACCEPTABLE WE SAW THE MARTINEZ MAP. OF WE HAVE BEST PRACTICES THAT WE LEARNED BOB AT THE STATE LEVEL SHOULD BE AND COULD BE APPLIED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL TO CREATE -- A FAIR DEMOCRATIC PROCESS SO. THE EASY WAY THAT ALWAYS THE FAIREST OF THE JUST TO THE BEST WAY -- THIS WILL CREATE SOME BURDENS BUT WE WE WHAT DO ARE OUR BEST TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYTHING WE ASK OUR LOCAL JUSTICE THIS CAN FICTIONS TO DO. HELPS OUR DEMOCRACY AND ADDS VALUE WITHOUT A RESPECT AFTER RIVAL THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO A MEMBER BONTA. A CLEARLY THERE'S A LOT OF WORK TO BE DONE TO MODERNIZE THE RULES THAT GOVERN LOCAL REDISTRICTING IN THIS BILL CONTAINS A NUMBER OF IMPORTANT ELEMENTS. TO IMPROVE THE LOCAL REDISTRICTING PROCESS. THAT BEING SAID IT'S IMPORTANT TO FIND THE PROPER BALANCE BETWEEN PROVIDING FOR AN INCLUSIVE REDISTRICTING PROCESS. IN ENSURING THAT THE PROCESS IS WORKABLE FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. THE OPPONENTS OF THIS BILL RAISE SOME VERY LEGITIMATE ISSUES -- AND SO I APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S EFFORTS TO TRY TO ADDRESS THEIR CONCERNS AND ADDRESS SOME LOGISTICAL AND LOGISTICAL CONCERNS THAT I HAD ABOUT THIS BILL ACTUALLY. HAD A MEETING A COUPLE WEEKS AGO WITH WITH THE PROPONENTS OF THE BILL BECAUSE I FIRST HEARD ABOUT IT I THOUGHT THIS IS A VERY RIGHTEOUS ISSUE -- WITH A LOT OF BIG PROBLEMS IN THE BILL AS IT WAS INITIALLY DRAFTED AND SO I REALLY APPRECIATE -- YEAH THE WILLINGNESS OF OF THE AUTHOR -- AND AND THE SPONSORS OF THE BILL TO MAKE SOME CHANGES MY ASSUMPTION IS THOSE WILL BE THE LAST CHANGES MADE -- AS YOU ALL CONTINUE TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS WITH WITH THE THE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS -- SO DOLLARS INCREASE AT THE OTHERS COME INTO ANY WORKING WITH THE OPPONENTS AS WE DISCUSSED WITH THAT UNDERSTANDING IN THE UNDERSTANDING OF THE AUTHOR WILL BE TAKING AMENDMENTS.

THANK YOU CHAIR MEMBERS ASSEMBLY BILL FIFTY NINE BUILDS UPON OUR STATE'S COMMITMENT TO INCREASE EVICTING GAUGE WHEN AND VOTER TURNOUT AMONG YOUNG VOTERS. I ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE SUGGESTED AMENDMENT FOR THE ANALYSIS. OF THE BILL WOULD DO THE THE FOLLOWING REQUIRE A VOTE CENTER OR SATELLITE OFFICES OF THE COUNT COUNTY ELECTIONS OFFICE TO BE PLACED. ON A CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY CAMPUS REQUEST THAT YOU SEE SYSTEMS AT A PLACE OF THOSE VOTES ON OUR SIDE OFFICE ON THEIR CAMPUSES. GIVE PREFERENCE TO VOTE CENTERS AND SATELLITE OFFICES THAT CALIFORNIA'S BEAUTY COLLEGE CAMPUSES AND PRIVATE UNIVERSITIES. REQUIRED COUNTY ELECTIONS OFFICIALS TO CONSIDER COLLEGE CAMPUSES WILL THESE TEN THOUSAND STUDENTS FOR A BOAT CENTER LOCATION AS PART OF THEIR JOB PLANTS. AND REQUIRE EACH VOTE CENTER SIDE OFFICE TO BE ACCESSIBLE TO VOTERS WITH DISABILITIES. IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE ACCESSIBILITY REQUIREMENTS DESCRIBED IN THE FEDERAL. EIGHTY EIGHT HAVING ACCESS TO ABOUT CENTER CAN EASILY SOLVE EVERY REASON A PERSON MAY HAVE THAT PREVENTS THEM FROM CASTING ABOUT. FOR THE MOVE FORGOT TO BETTER SIR LOS ABOUT THE AT WORK OR SCHOOL ON TUESDAYS. I DON'T HAVE STAMPS MAYBE ENGLISH AS THEIR FIRST LANGUAGE. IT CAN ALL BE SOLVED. AND THEY WILL BE ABLE TO CAST A BALLOT. CALL CALL CAPS ARE UNIQUELY SUITED TO HOST VOTE CENTERS AND SATELLITE OFFICES BECAUSE CALL STUDENTS ESPECIALLY BASS THESE BARRIERS TO VOTING AND AS WE KNOW COLLEGE CAMPUSES OURS. WRINKLED THROUGHOUT OUR ENTIRE STATE. THAT'S CSU SACRAMENTO -- BY WAY OF EXAMPLE WERE ABOUT CENTER WAS PLACES PAST ELECTION WE SAW A TOTAL OF FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY FOUR IN PERSON VOTERS FIVE HUNDRED EIGHTY EIGHT PEOPLE THAT REGISTERED AND VOTED. USING CONDITION WHICH IS AN ENORMOUS NUMBER WHICH IS. USING CONDITIONAL VOTER REGISTRATION AT TWENTY FOUR HUNDRED VOTE BY MAIL BALLOTS DROPPED OFF AB FIFTY NINE WILL EXPAND THE SUCCESS THAT WE SOUGHT CSU SACRAMENTO CAMPUSES ALL ACROSS THE STATE. BY BRING ABOUT CENTER TO THEM WE ARE EMPOWERING AND ENGAGING YOUNG PEOPLE WHICH WILL IN TURN DECREASED A DISPROPORTIONATE REPRESENTATION VOTER TURNOUT. AND MOVE MOVE US TOWARD A MORE TOWARDS A MORE PERFECT DEMOCRACY. WITH ME PROVIDE SPORTING TESTIMONY IS NO WELL MORE OF THE PRESIDENT ASSOCIATES STUDENTS AT SAC STATE. MIKE MOOD OF FAR OUT FROM SEATTLE BACK TO COLLEGE AND RACHEL EBAY FROM UC IRVINE. PLEASE. GOOD MORNING SIR BERMAN AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS NO WELL MORE AND I CURRENTLY SERVE AS THE ASSOCIATED STUDENTS PRESIDENT AT SAC STATE I WANT TO THINK ASSEMBLY MEMBER KALRA -- FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY IN HIS LEADERSHIP ON THIS CRITICAL ISSUE OF CIVIC RIGHTS AND ENGAGEMENT. I'M EXCITED TO ATTEST TO THE EFFECTIVENESS OF HAVING A VOTE CENTER ON A COLLEGE CAMPUS -- WILL STUDENTS DEEPLY CARE ABOUT ISSUES OUTSIDE OF OUR COLLEGE EXPERIENCE AND BEING CIVIC WE ENGAGED THE UNIQUE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT WERE IN -- MAKING GAUGING IN ELECTION PROCESS SEES A LOT MORE CHALLENGING -- BOTH DUE TO LOGISTICS AND DUE TO OVERALL AWARENESS FOR STUDENTS LIFE CAN GET TO BE EXPRESSLY HECTIC WITH COMPETING RESPONSIBILITIES THAT INCLUDE ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT OF COURSE ENGAGING IN EXTRA CURRICULAR. AND PROFESSIONAL ACTIVITIES BUT ALSO WORKING JOBS OFTEN MULTIPLE ONES AND WELL OVER TWENTY HOURS A WEEK TO AFFORD TO PRESENT A COLLEGE EDUCATION. I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT THIS BILL ENABLES ALL CSU STUDENTS TO EXERCISE THE RIGHT TO VOTE IN THE SAME WAY THAT WE WERE ABLE TO AT SAC STATE. BY INCREASING ACCESS AND VISIBILITY TO THIS MOST FUNDAMENTAL CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT. I ALSO WANT TO MENTION SOME POINTS OF PRIDE THAT WE HAVE -- REGARDING OUR VOTE CENTER WE HAD THE LARGEST CONDITIONAL VOTER COUNT ABOUT VOTE CENTERS AND SAT COUNTY AND ACTUALLY THE ENTIRE STATE. IN ADDITION WE HAD TWO THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED VOTE BY MAIL BALLOTS DROPPED OFF AND THE AMOUNT OF STUDENTS WAITING TO BE ISSUED A BALLOT IN THE LINES -- AT THE POLLS WAS ALSO QUITE EXTRAORDINARY WE GOT STUDENTS WAITING IN LINE AND TOLL OF IN PM WHICH REALLY UNDERSCORES THE DEDICATION THAT STUDENTS HAD IN EXERCISING THIS RIGHT. IN ESSENCE IT WAS CLEARLY NEEDED AND IT WAS USED EXTENSIVELY. HAVING THE VOTE CENTER ALSO PROVIDED AN OPPORTUNITY FOR VARIOUS STUDENT LEADERS TO COME TOGETHER AND HOST INCREDIBLE. OF BOTH PARTIES THAT HIGHLIGHTED THE CENTER AND THAT REALLY CREATED A CULTURE OF COMMUNITY OF CIVIC ENGAGEMENT. I'M IT SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED VOTER APATHY A YOUNG AMONG YOUNGER VOTERS WHICH IS A HUGE ISSUE. AND THE IMPACT WAS ALMOST IMMEASURABLE -- EXCEPT IT IS AND THAT'S WHY PROVIDED THE NUMBERS. FOR THESE REASONS I URGE YOU TO SUPPORT AND VOTE YES ON A. B. FIFTY NINE THANK YOU THANK YOU. A GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN AND THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR ALLOWING ME TO SPEAK HERE TODAY -- MY NAME IS MAHMOUD EL FAR I'M THE DIRECTOR OF MUCH FOR LET'S CALIFORNIA AND THE DIRECTOR OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS FOR THE STUDENT GOVERNMENT. AT SUBCOMMITTEE COLLEGE ALSO LIKE THIS THANK ASSEMBLYMAN KALRA FOR LETTING ME TESTIFY HERE TODAY. I'M HERE IN SUPPORT OF AB FIFTY NINE BECAUSE I BELIEVE IT IS ESSENTIAL INISH INSURING STRONGER VOTER TURNOUT AMONG COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS AS WELL AS COLLEGE STUDENTS IN GENERAL. AND THE STRENGTH IN OUR DEMOCRACY AS A WHOLE YOUNG PEOPLE CALIFORNIA VOTE AT ALARMINGLY LOW RATES. I BELIEVE ON CAMPUS VOTE CENTERS WILL MAKE IT EASIER FOR YOUNG PEOPLE TO VOTE. AND WILL ELIMINATE ANY MORE BARRIERS THAT PREVENT THEM FROM VOTING. COMMUNITY COLLEGES ARE SPECIALLY IN NEED OF ON CAMPUS VOTE CENTERS DUE TO THE DIVERSITY OF THEIR STUDENT BODIES. THERE ARE TWO POINT THREE MILLION STUDENTS ENROLLED IN COMMUNITY COLLEGES ACROSS CALIFORNIA AND ONE POINT THREE MILLION OF THEM ARE UNDER. TWENTY FIVE COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS OFTEN WORK FULL TIME AND PART TIME JOBS WHILE GOING TO SCHOOL AND HAVE TROUBLE FINDING TIME TO VOTE ON ELECTION DAY. MANY MAY HAVE NEVER VOTED BEFORE AND HAVE NEVER HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO GO TO THE POLLS WITHOUT APPARENT. THE ABILITY TO VOTE I VOTE CENTERS ON CAMPUS WOULD ALLOW STUDENTS TO EASILY VOTE. WITHOUT HAVING TO MISS CLASS OR CALL OUT OF WORK. BUT SENATOR MOWER COST EFFECTIVE SAFE AND IT MAKES IT EASIER TO VOTE. IN THE PAST MID TERM ELECTION I SAW HOW BENEFICIAL ON CAMPUS VOTE CENTERS CAN BE EVEN FOR ONE SINGLE DAY. I THOUGHT ABOUT COLLEGE WE HAD A POP UP VOTE CENTER THAT ARRIVED ON OUR CAMPUS FOR ONE DAY ON HALLOWEEN. AS YOU COULD IMAGINE YOU'D EXPECT STUDENTS NOT TO BE ON CAMPUS DURING HALLOWEEN -- BUT IT DEDICATED FULL SERVICE VOTE CENTERS. AND PROVIDE ON CAMPUS FOR FUTURE ELECTIONS AND WE HAD A SIGNIFICANTLY HIGH VOTER TURNOUT ON THAT DAY. IN THE STEPS DESPITE IT BEING A HOLIDAY OVER THREE HUNDRED STUDENTS CAST EARLY BALLOTS THAT DAY AND WE CAN EXPECT THAT NUMBER TO SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE IF THIS BILL DOES PASS. THIS IS AN IMPORTANT ISSUE FOR MUCH REALIZE CALIFORNIA BECAUSE YOU WANT TO EMPOWER YOUTH TO HAVE A ROLE IN THE POLICY DECISIONS. THAT SHAPE THEIR LIVES AB FIFTY NINE GIVES YOUNG PEOPLE THE TOOLS TO MAKE THEIR VOICES HEARD. THEREFORE I RESPECTFULLY ASK ALL OF YOU HERE ON THE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE FOR YOUR SUPPORT ON THIS BILL THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU VERY MUCH. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS RICHARD YOU BAY AT ONE OF THE CORRECT THIS UP IN MY FOR LIFE CALIFORNIA AND I'M A STUDENT AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA IRVINE. AS STUDENT I SAW FIRSTHAND THE DIFFICULTIES AND THE IMPORTANCE OF VOTING IN COLLEGE CAMPUSES. STUDENTS CARE ABOUT THE ISSUES AND POLITICS BUBBLE AT A LOWER RATE THAN ANY OTHER AGE GROUP I SAW YOU SAY STUDENTS CANVASSING FOR CANDIDATES UP AND DOWN. THE BALLOT ON AND ON ALL SIDES OF THE SPECTRUM. THANKS FOR A GREAT REGISTER VOTERS YOU SEE I WAS LUCKY ENOUGH TO HAVE SEVERAL POLLING PLACES ON CAMPUS BUT EVERY SINGLE ONE STILL HAD A LINE LONGER THAN TWO HOURS. I PERSONALLY HAD TO WAIT ABOUT TWO AND A HALF HOURS JUST TO VOTE BUT THE TIME I GOT TO THE FRONT OF THE LINE I HAD MR LECTURE IN NOTED TECHS AND THE RIGHT TO VOTE. TO ME IT WAS WORTH IT BUT I SHOULD NOT HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN BOTH. MANY OF MY FRIENDS AND HALL MATES TOLD ME THAT THEY DIDN'T VOTE BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO GET TO CLASS. THEN HAVE TIME TO WAIT IN LINE AND MANY ALSO HAD COMPLICATIONS WHAT THEY FOUND THE RIGHT TO THE POLLING CENTER. IN ADDITION TO LONG LINES THE BOWLING CENTERS THAT HAVE TRAINED STAFF AND TOLD STUDENTS IT WAS NO SAME DAY VOTER REGISTRATION. MANY OF THE BALLOTS WERE PROVISIONAL BECAUSE THEY SIMPLY RAN OUT OF ORIGINAL BALLOTS. AND MANY STUDENTS FACE DISENFRANCHISEMENT BECAUSE OF AN UNACCOUNTED ISSUES WITH ALL MY REGISTRATION THAT DID NOT ALLOW THEM TO CHANGE THE ADDRESS TO THE SCHOOLS. THERE'S NO DENYING THAT THEY'RE HERE THAT THERE'S A HIGH DEMAND AND LOW SUPPLY VOTING LOCATIONS AND THE ANSWER WOULD BE TO PROVIDE VOTING CENTERS AND WHICH WOULD A LOT FOR THE EXTRA ASSISTANCE. AREAS LIKE LONG LINES TO TO THE LEAD TO THE DISENFRANCHISEMENT OF YOUNGER POPULATIONS WOULD BE EVEN WORSE THAN. LONG LINES WOULD BE NO LINE AT ALL BECAUSE THERE'S NO WHERE TO VOTE. LIKE MANY OF MY PEERS I DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO A CAR OR RELIABLE TRANSPORTATION WOULD WOULD WHICH WOULD MEAN THAT IF THERE WERE NO NEARBY -- LOCATION VOTE I DON'T KNOW HOW I WOULD GET THEIR I CAME HERE ALL THE WAY FROM IRVINE TO ADVOCATE FOR THIS BILL WHICH SHOWS THAT I GO TO ANY LENGTHS TO VOTE. HOWEVER IT THE AVERAGE BUSY BECAUSE CITY CANNOT AFFORD TO SPEND MUCH TIME AWAY FROM SCHOOL TO GET TO A POINT PLACE. AS COLLEGE STUDENTS WE NEED AB FIFTY NINE TO GIVE STUDENTS THE OPPORTUNITY TO VOTE TERM FRANCHISE A POPULATION OF AGAINST COSTED FRIENDS THAT ARE OFTEN FORGOTTEN. I FULLY SUPPORT AB FIFTY NINE AND ASK OF THIS COMMITTEE TO VOTE IN FAVOR OF THIS BILL. THANK YOU.

GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO PRESENT ASSEMBLY BILL SEVEN EIGHT SEVEN WHICH WOULD HELP PROVIDE INCARCERATED PEOPLE IN COUNTY JAILS INFORMATION ON VOTER REGISTRATION AND VOTERS RIGHTS. CALIFORNIA INCARCERATE OVER EIGHTY THOUSAND PEOPLE. IN HIS JAIL AND MORE THAN HALF OF THEM -- HAVE NOT BEEN SENTENCED OR ON FENTON'S OR EXCUSE ME HAVE NOT BEEN CONVICTED OR THEY ARE ON SENTENCE. OF THIS IS A LARGE COMMUNITY THAT HAS HISTORICALLY BEEN EXCLUDED FROM CIVIC PARTICIPATION DUE TO EITHER -- MISSED INFORMATION OR LACK OF INFORMATION MANY. WHO ARE BEHIND BARS DO NOT KNOW THEY CAN REGISTER TO VOTE CURRENT LAW REQUIRES STATES AND LOCAL JUVENILE DETENTION FACILITIES TO ASSIST AND VOTER REGISTRATION FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE AGED WHO ARE AGENT? WHO CAN VOTE OF H. AND R. HAVE NOT BEEN SERVING A FELONY -- SENTENCE THIS BILL WOULD AN ACT A SIMILAR PROVISION FOR ADULTS BY REQUIRING EACH COUNTY JAIL TO ALLOW AT LEAST ONE ORGANIZATION. TO PROVIDE A BORDER EDUCATION PROGRAM IN COUNTY JAIL THIS PROGRAM WILL INCLUDE INFORMATION ABOUT VOTERS RIGHTS. VOTER REGISTRATION ASSISTING WITH RETURNING THE VOTER REGISTRATION CARD TO AN ELECTION OFFICIAL WITH ME TO PROVIDE SUPPORTING TESTIMONIES REPRESENTATIVE. FROM A NEW WAY OF LIFE AND ALSO THE ACLU. GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS BRITTANY STONECIPHER AND I'M A VOTING RIGHTS ATTORNEY WITH THE ACLU OF CALIFORNIA. THE ACLU IS PLEASED TO SUPPORT AB SEVEN EIGHTY SEVEN WITH WHICH WOULD REDUCE PRACTICAL BARRIERS FOR PEOPLE ARE IMPACTED BY THE CRIMINAL LEGAL SYSTEM BUT WHO NONETHELESS HAVE THE RIGHT TO VOTE. AS CALIFORNIA HAS BEGUN TO MOVE AWAY FROM MASS INCARCERATION AND TOWARDS CREATING MORE INCLUSIVE ELECTORATE IT CLARIFIED THAT PEOPLE KEEP THEIR VOTING RIGHTS WHEN THEY'RE IN COUNTY JAIL OR WHEN THEY'RE ON A FORM OF COUNTY LEVEL COMMUNITY SUPERVISION. NONETHELESS THE APPROXIMATELY EIGHTY THOUSAND PEOPLE WHO ARE INCARCERATED IN COUNTY JAILS LARGELY BLACK AND BROWN FOLKS. FACE A UNIQUE SET OF LOGISTICAL OBSTACLES WHEN THEY REACH FOR THE BALLOT BOX. EIGHTY SEVEN EIGHTY SEVEN WILL HELP CALIFORNIANS IN COUNTY JAIL TO OVERCOME THESE HURDLES BY REQUIRING SHERIFF'S TO ALLOW ORGANIZATIONS TO CONDUCT IN PERSON VOTER REGISTRATION ACTIVITIES. COUNTIES ORGANIZATIONS HAVE PARTNERED WITH JAILS TO PROVIDE THESE PROGRAMS OF OFTEN SEEN GREAT SUCCESS. IN JUST TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN FOR INSTANCE COUNTY ORGANIZATIONS HELP THE REGISTER OVER THREE THOUSAND PEOPLE AND HELP TO RETURN OVER THOUSAND BALLOTS FROM INSIDE LA COUNTY JAILS. IN ORANGE COUNTY BY CONTRAST WITH THE SHERIFF HAS DENIED ACCESS TO JAILS TO DO REGISTRATION CIVIL RIGHTS ORGANIZATIONS OF OFTEN HAD TO RESORT TO LESS EFFECTIVE AND MORE RESOURCE INTENSIVE METHODS SUCH AS WAITING OUTSIDE OF THE JAILS AT NIGHT. FOR PEOPLE TO BE RELEASED SECOND REGISTER THEM OR SPENDING MONEY ON DOING MASSIVE MAILINGS TO PEOPLE INSIDE THE COUNTY JAILS. EIGHTY SEVEN EIGHTY SEVEN ALSO MADE PROCEDURAL REFORMS THAT WILL UP THAT ON HOW COUNTIES UPDATE THE REGISTRATION STATUS OF VOTERS WITH CONVICTIONS. SO THAT WE CAN ENSURE THAT PEOPLE ARE NOT IMPROPERLY DISENFRANCHISED BECAUSE OF OUTDATED COURT REPORTING SYSTEMS OR MISINFORMATION. UNFORTUNATELY WE'VE HEARD FROM ADVOCATES ELECTION OFFICIALS AND VOTERS THAT SOME COURTS ARE STILL SENDING OVER INCLUSIVE LISTS OF CONVICTED OR EVEN JUST CHARGED. UP PEOPLE WITH FELONIES. LAST YEAR SEVERAL COUNTIES FACE THE THREAT OF LAWSUITS IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TYPES OF ERRORS. LAOS THE PROTECT THE RIGHT TO VOTE FOR PEOPLE ON COUNTY SUPERVISION AND THE I ON THIS BILL THANK YOU.

YOU DO YOU DO LEGALLY HAVE THAT THAT RIGHT BUT BEFORE COMING THEY SO YOU I SPENT A LONG TIME WITH LEGAL SERVICES FOR PRISONERS THE CHILDREN GOING INSIDE OF COUNTY JAILS AND PRISONS AND THERE ARE A LOT OF LOGISTICAL BARRIERS TO ACCESSING. THINGS THAT ARE VERY EASY ON THE OUTSIDE TO LONG MAIL PROCESSING% TIMES RESTRICTIONS ABOUT NOT BEING ABLE TO HAVE PAN AND THINGS LIKE THAT THAT WOULD BE A SIGNIFICANTLY AIDED BY A PARTNERSHIP WITH CAN'T COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS AND THE SHERIFF TO BE ABLE TO LET ORGANIZATIONS INSIDE TO HELP. RIGHT OKAY SO. SO I MEAN THAT'S WHERE I'M GETTING A BIT. THE POINT I'M GETTING AT IS YOU HAVE THE ABILITY TO BILLS REGISTER AND VOTE SO THEY'RE JUST I MEAN TO ME IT'S LIKE ANYBODY ELSE. WHY SHOULD WE SPECIFICALLY -- SAY HEY LOOK FOR THIS SPECIFIC GROUP WE GOTTA DO EVEN MORE. YOU KNOW OF A MAN WHAT WHY NOT SAY THAT ABOUT. I DON'T KNOW -- HOME SCHOOL PARENTS WE NEED TO REACH OUT TO THEM TO MAKE SURE THEY VOTE OR I MEAN WHY DO WE HAVE. TO FOCUS ON ONE INDIVIDUAL GROUP OF PEOPLE HOW DO ALREADY HAVE ACCESS TO BILLS REGISTRATION AND THE RIGHT TO VOTE. HOW DO HOW DO YOU REGISTER BUT WE HAVE NO PAN? SO TODAY IF SOMEBODY SAID IF THERE'S A PERSON IN COUNTY JAIL AND SAID HEY I WANT TO REGISTER TO VOTE -- THE INDIVIDUAL. YOU'RE SAYING THAT THE THE YEAH THE JAIL SUPERVISOR WOULD GIVE THEM A REGISTRATION PAPERWORK WITH THIS A SO I CAN'T GIVE YOU A PEN HER I.. BUT IS THAT WHAT THEY WOULD DO INDIVIDUALS IN JAIL RIGHT NOW -- BECAUSE WHATEVER THEY FACE WITH WHO AGAIN HAD NOT BEEN CONVICTED -- WILL NOT ALWAYS. TRUE RED INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE IN JAIL AND COUNTY JAILS RIGHT NOW -- VOTER REGISTRATION [inaudible] VOTING. THAT'S THE REASON WHY WE WANT TO GO IN THERE TO LET THEM KNOW THEY HAVE THE RIGHT BECAUSE THEY DON'T THINK THEY HAVE ANY RIGHTS BECAUSE ONCE A GOING TO JAIL. THEY BELIEVE THEIR RIGHTS HAVE BEEN SOMEHOW TAKEN AWAY BECAUSE THEY'RE THEY'RE IN JAIL AND SO WHAT THESE ORGANIZATIONS WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO IS TO DO VOTER EDUCATION. TO LET THEM KNOW YOU ARE BECAUSE YOU HAVE NOT BEEN SENTENCE -- BUT YOU HAVE THE RIGHT -- TO ONE TO REGISTER TO VOTE AND EXERCISE -- THAT VOTE AS WELL AND SO THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL AND SPIRIT THIS BILL IS ATTEMPTING TO TRY TO DO IS ALLOW ORGANIZATIONS TO EDUCATE. THOSE INDIVIDUALS WERE IN COUNTY JAIL THAT YOU DO HAVE THE RIGHT AND THEN ALSO ONCE YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOU HAVE THAT RIGHT IS TO ALSO PROVIDE THE VOTER REGISTRATION CARD. TAKE THEIR VOTER REGISTRATION CARD TO THE ELECTION OFFICIAL AND DEPOSIT WITHIN -- THAT PARTICULAR STRUCTURE STILL THEY CAN IN FACT VOTE. BY WHY I GET OUT I GET OUT WHAT YOUR INTENT I WILL WRAP UP HERE MISTER CHAIRMAN I'M SORRY AND I KIND OF CAME IN HERE LATE TO THIS -- BUT I I MEAN I THINK WHAT I'M GETTING AT IS. YOU KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE OUT THERE IN THE WORLD THAT MAYBE DON'T NECESSARILY KNOW THAT FRANCES THEY COULD REGISTER THE SAME DAY AND AND VOTE YOU KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T KNOW EVERY SINGLE DETAIL SURE ABOUT THEIR VOTING SO I JUST. HAVE A HARD TIME LIKE PIGEON HOLE IN ONE GROUP AND SAY HEY WE'RE GOING TO DO OUT REACH TO THIS GROUP IN THIS GROUP ONLY. I MEAN OVER OTHER GROUPS I MEAN WHY NOT DO IT LIKE I SAID. FOR A BUNCH OF OTHER GROUPS RIGHT NOW. I JUST THINK THAT -- ONE WE'RE GIVING OUT NOTICES TO PEOPLE THERE'S LOTS OF INFORMATION OUT THERE ABOUT HOW TO VOTE. AND AND TO ME IT NOBODY'S ACCESS IS BEING BLOCKED OFF AND SO I JUST DON'T SEE AGAIN THE REASONING YOU KNOW FOR THIS SPECIFIC RIGHT WRIST GALLAGHER FOR THE SAME REASON THE STUDENTS WERE HERE. REPRESENTING THE UNIVERSITY IS TO MAKING SURE THAT EVERY -- STUDENTS ON CAMPUS HAVE ACCESS TO THE RIGHT TO VOTE NOW WITH PROPER VOTER EDUCATION -- BEING MADE AVAILABLE TO THEM THAT IT WAS THE STUDENTS WHO RIDE I I DON'T THINK THEY NEEDED EITHER AND SO YOU KNOW EXACTLY -- BUT NO I'M NOT. IN THE BECAUSE THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSISTENT RIGHT TO SAY IT BECAUSE I MEAN JUST TO BE VERY CLEAR LIKE. TO ME THERE'S SO MUCH INFORMATION OUT THERE IT IS EASY TO VOTE AND I'VE SAID THIS MANY TIMES THIS COMMUNITY IN THIS COMMITTEE. SO -- TO SAY THAT AND WITH CONSIDERING ALL THAT WE HAVE DONE TO MAKE IT VERY EASY TO VOTE. IN THE STATE. TO SAY THAT WE NOW HAVE TO TARGET SPECIFIC GROUPS WHETHER IT'S STUDENTS OR ANY GROUP FOR THAT MATTER -- OVER OTHER GROUPS YOU KNOW TO ME IS KIND OF WHY WE MAKE IN THAT SPECIAL CASE FOR A SPECIAL GROUP OF PEOPLE. MAYBE THEY VOTE FOR ONE PARTY OVER THE OTHER MORE THAN THE OTHER I DON'T KNOW MAYBE THAT'S THE REASON I DON'T KNOW. I'M NOT I'M NOT SAYING THAT THAT TO A REASON. BUT WHAT ABOUT THE BUT I THINK. MIDDLE WITH EMPLOYEES YEAH I HEARD THE JURY COMMISSIONER WAS TRYING TO MAKE THE CASE TO REPUBLICANS BUT I HEARD THAT GOT FACT FACT CHECK FALLS ON THE ANYWAYS. BUT BOTTOM LINE IS I MEAN I DON'T KNOW WHY WE NEED TO SPECIFICALLY TARGET ANY GROUP OVER ANOTHER -- YOU KNOW WHEN THERE IS A LOT OF INFORMATION OUT THERE FOR THE PUBLIC TO MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT. VOTING AND AND AND KNOW WHAT THEIR RIGHTS ARE AND WHAT THEY HAVE ACCESS. TO THE WAS ROASTER BUT WEBER. I JUST WANTED IS SIMPLY SAY YOU KNOW. THIS IS A THIS IS AN EXTREMELY IMPORTANT ISSUE THAT ARE MY COLLEAGUES RAISING YOU KNOW MOST OF YOU KNOW I SPENT IF YOU THE FIRST FOUR YEARS OF MY LIFE HERE AT THE CAPITOL. BASICALLY WITH VARYING VOTING RIGHTS BILLS TO IN TERMS OF THOSE WERE INCARCERATED MAKING SURE IT AND IN COURT MAKING SURE THAT -- THAT PEOPLE KNEW THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO VOTE AND I WAS AMAZED AT HOW MANY PEOPLE WALK AROUND THIS CAPITAL WHO DID NOT KNOW SOMEONE MORE PROBATION OFFICERS WHO DIDN'T KNOW THAT -- THAT'D NEXT THE PERSON WITH THE EX FELON HAD THE RIGHT TO VOTE THEY THOUGHT IT ONCE YOU COMMITTED FELONY YOU COULD NEVER VOTE AGAIN I MEAN THESE ARE PEOPLE TOLD ME WHEN I GOT AND I WAS JUST TOTALLY SHOCKED. BECAUSE THEY WERE PROBATION OFFICERS AND OTHERS WHO DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THE RULES WE DIDN'T KNOW THE LAW. AND THEN IN ADDITION TO THAT WHEN THE WHOLE ISSUE WITH THE CURRENT -- SECRETARY STATE CAME DOWN THE DECISION WE DID A PODCAST AND WE HEARD SO MANY PEOPLE WHO TALKED ABOUT THE FACT THAT THEY WERE ADVOCATES TRYING TO GET INTO JAILS. TO BASICALLY REGISTER PEOPLE TO VOTE AND HELP THEM UNDERSTAND AND THEY WERE BEING BLOCKED BY SHERIFF'S WHO DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THE LAW NUMBER ONE IN WHO DIDN'T REALLY CARE SOME OF THEM. NOW THERE'S SOME SHERIFFS LIKE THE ONE IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY WHO GOES OUT OF HIS WAY GORE DOES TO MAKE SURE THAT THE MATERIALS THERE IS AVAILABLE BUT HE'LL TELL YOU EVERYONE DOESN'T DO THE SAME THING. AND SO AS A RESULT WE HAVE A GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO ARE INCARCERATED. WHICH MEANS THEY HAVE LIMITED ACCESS TO TELEPHONES MATERIALS ALL THOSE KINDS OF THINGS AND IF THAT JAIL DOES NOT PUT UP MATERIAL FOR THEM TO REGISTER TO VOTE THEY WILL LET HIM GO ONLINE AND REGISTER TO VOTE. AND ALL THAT OTHER KIND OF STUFF IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN IN MOST FOLKS DON'T KNOW THAT THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO VOTE THAT EVEN GROUPS ARE GOING TO PICK UP THEIR ABSENTEE BALLOTS -- IF THEY GIVEN AFTER THE BALLOT BECOMES AN OBSTACLE IN A CHALLENGE SO. THIS IS UNLIKE YOU KNOW I CAN SOMETIMES UNDERSTAND STUDENTS BECAUSE STUDENTS REALLY CAN MAKE THE TIME TO DO WHATEVER THEY WANT TO DO YOU KNOW BEGIN SOME SLACK THEIR YOUNG WHATEVER. YOU KNOW BUT BUT IF IT WAS A PARTY GOING ON YOU KNOW EVERYBODY BE DEAR AND SO -- SO I UNDERSTAND THAT. I'M I'M I'M JUST SAYING IT ON CAMPUS AS I UNDERSTAND THAT THE STUDENTS WILL FIGURE IT OUT IF THEY REALLY WANT TO BECAUSE IT UBER LIFT ALL OVER THE WORLD OKAY. BUT BUT PEOPLE WHO ARE INCARCERATED WILL LOCKED UP OR AT THE MERCY. OF OF THE SHERIFF IN THE JAILER AND ALL THESE OTHER PEOPLE WHO MAY NOT GIVE THEM THE MATERIAL AND SO I THOUGHT ON THIS PODCAST ARE A LOT OF COMMUNITY ORGANIZATION WAS SAYING. YOU KNOW WE HAVE THIS AS OUR MISSION WE GO INTO JAILS WE TAKE MATERIAL WE EXPLAIN THINGS AND WE CAN'T GET THROUGH THIS SUCH AN ABEER YOUR THAT YOU KNOW YOU CAN'T BRING CERTAIN PEOPLE YOU CAN'T HAVE THIS KIND OF AND SO. SOME JAILS DO NOT GET THE BENEFIT OF COULD NOT PROFIT ORGANIZATIONS GOING IN TO HELP THEM SO THIS IS REALLY A SPECIAL CASE OF FOLKS WHO ARE WHO DON'T HAVE ACCESS. BECAUSE THEY ARE LOCKED UP AND IF THEY AND YET THEY NEED THE INFORMATION AND THEY NEED THE MATERIALS THAT THEIR SELF YOU KNOW I I SUPPORT THIS BECAUSE IT IS A HUGE PROBLEM FOR THE NONPROFIT GROUPS THAT ARE OUT THERE. TRYING TO HELP FOLKS REGISTER TO VOTE UNLIKE SOME OF THE OTHER STUFF JUST TRYING TO GET PEOPLE MOTOR. MOTOR MOTIVATED IN OUR COMMUNITIES TO GO TO THE POLLS THESE FOLKS EVEN IF THEY'RE MOTIVATED HAVE TREMENDOUS OBSTACLES. THANK YOU DOCTOR MISTER CALDERON. THANK YOU -- FOR THIS IS JOE AND I JUST I JUST WANNA MAKE A CLARIFICATION BECAUSE I MEAN I THINK HE WAS HALF JOKING BUT YOU KNOW THERE IS THIS IDEA THAT WE THAT WE AUTHOR -- THESE TYPES OF BILLS DEMOCRATS BECAUSE WE BELIEVE IN THE PUBLIC BELIEVES THAT THIS POPULATION IS A POPULATION OF A VOTE FOR DEMOCRATS AND IT'S ANOTHER WAY FOR US TO HOW TO RIG THE ELECTION IN OUR FAVOR BECAUSE WE'RE ALLOWING THEM. TO VOTE WHEN OF COURSE YOU SHOULD HAVE NO SYMPATHY FOR SOMEONE WHO MESSED UP -- IN LIFE IN A GRANTED NOBODY. NOBODY IS GOING TO EXCUSE SOME OF THE BEHAVIOR OF SOME THESE INDIVIDUALS ARE BUT OUR LAWS ARE LAWS AND IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THERE LAW THAT THESE LAWS ARE ENFORCED. AND THAT EVERYBODY'S AWARE WHAT THE LAWS ARE -- BUT I I DO WANT TO MAKE THE CLARIFICATION THAT WHEN WHEN GEORGE PAPADOPOULOS WAS ASKED ABOUT HIS TIME IN JAIL. A HE SAID IT WASN'T BAD AT ALL BECAUSE THE GUYS WE SOARING WITH WORLD SHOT STOCKS TRUMP SUPPORTERS AS IN A TREATED. WELL. YEAH AND HE FELL RIGHT AND HOW MANY THAT HERE ON THE RIGHT SO I JUST IF THIS IS THIS IS NOT ABOUT ANECDOTAL ARTISAN. THIS IS NOT ABOUT A PARTISAN ISSUE AND THEIR PEOPLE IN JAILS ABOUT FOR BOTH REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS I JUST THINK IT'S IMPORTANT -- TO MAKE THE CLARIFICATION THAT THIS ISN'T ABOUT -- TRYING TO GET MORE VOTES FOR THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY'S ABOUT THE LINE MAKE SURE THE LAW IS ENFORCED CORRECTLY THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- SEEING NO ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM MY COLLEAGUES -- MISTER GIBSON. WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE YES THANK YOU VERY MUCH I CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THE COMMITTEES AND ALL THE MEMBERS IN THIS ROBUST CONVERSATION I DO WANT. TO MAKE ONE CORRECTION A NEW WAY OF LIFE WAS HERE BUT HAD TO ACTUALLY -- CATCH A FLIGHT BACK HOME AND TO MR GALLAGHER'S ON POINT -- HE'S MADE A REFERENCE TO SPECIAL GROUPS OF PEOPLE AND I THINK THAT YOU KNOW IT IT IS A SPECIAL GROUP OF PEOPLE AS A SPECIAL GROUP OF PEOPLE. WHO HAVE BEEN -- IN IN THIS SPECIFIC REGARD -- HAVE BEEN TOLD OR BELIEVE THAT THEY HAVE NO RIGHTS AND THIS BILL CLARIFIES WITH EDUCATION -- IN THIS PARTICULAR REGARD -- BUT AGAIN WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DO EVERYTHING WE CAN FOR THIS A POPULATION OF INDIVIDUALS WHO STILL HAVE RIGHTS -- ON IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK BUT I VOTE THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER GIBSON THIS BILL ESTABLISHED STATEWIDE PROCEDURES THAT WILL HELP ENSURE OR MUSICIANS THAT CONDUCT IN PERSON VOTER REGISTRATION. ACTIVITIES AT JAIL FACILITIES ARE TREATED FAIRLY ACROSS THE STATE. I HOPE HOWEVER THAT THE AUTHOR AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR OF INDICATIONS THAT YOU'LL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE COUNTY ELECTIONS OFFICIALS. TO ADDRESS THEIR CONCERNS REGARDING THE DATA SHARING PROVISIONS THANK YOU -- IN THE BILL -- WITH THAT I'M RECOMMENDING A SUPPORT ON THE BILL MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL VOTE. THE MOTION IS TO PASS AND RE REFER TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS BERMAN HI BERMAN I'D GALLAGHER. THINKING ABOUT IT GALLAGHER IS NOT VOTING ANOTHER LOOKING BACK -- CALDERON CALDERON ON A LOW MAYES MULLIN. WEBER. WEBER I THE BILL IS ON CALL THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MOVING ON I SEEMS MCCARTY IN THE AUDIENCE WANTS TO EXPAND SOME RIGHTS -- WORKING WITH THE ITEM NUMBER -- EIGHT SB SIX FORTY SIX YES MISTER GIPSON JUST WARNED AS THAT THAT'S RIGHT YEAH. THIS IS A SIMILAR -- TOPICAL BIT DIFFERENT THIS IS PART OF A A PACKAGE OF BILLS THE TO BILL PACKAGE I'M WORKING ON TO RESTORE THE VOTE FOR PAROLEES PEOPLE WHO HAVE SERVED THEIR TIME. BUT HAVE BEEN RELEASED FROM PRISON BUT STILL AREN'T ALLOW THE RIGHTS TO VOTES. MISTER MISTER VICE CHAIR THIS IS IN A RED STATE OR A BLUE STATE ISSUE. MISTER VICE CHAIR. MISTER VICE CHAIR. YES. THE STATE A FLORIDA UTAH MAINE NORTH DAKOTA. HAVE A RESTORED RIGHTS FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE SERVED THEIR TIME IN PRISON TO VOTE. THERE'S EVEN TWO STATES IN THE COUNTRY. OR YOU CAN VOTE. WHILE YOU'RE INCARCERATED IN STATE PRISON ONE OF THEM IS A REPUBLICAN STATE ONCE A DEMOCRAT STATE SO IT'S NOT A BLACK AND WHITE ISSUE WE SAW IN FLORIDA THAT JUST AS MANY PEOPLE WHO OUT THERE -- RIGHTS RESTORED TO VOTE REPUBLICAN AS DEMOCRAT THIS IS ABOUT FULLY REINTEGRATING INDIVIDUALS BACK INTO OUR SOCIETY WE WANT INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE ON PAROLE. TO BE ABLE TO FEEL THAT THEY ARE A FIRST CLASS CITIZENS AND NOT. LEFT WITHOUT SOME RIGHTS LIKE BUILDING SO THIS IS CONTINGENT ON THE PASSAGE OF A CA SIX WHICH WILL BE BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE IN THE COMING WEEKS BUT BUT BECAUSE OF SCHEDULING ISSUES -- WE HAD TO BRING THIS TRAILER BILL -- FORWARD AND A BIT EARLIER -- ASK FOR YOUR VOTE TODAY WITH ME ARE TWO REPRESENTATIVES -- ONE FROM ACLU AND WENT FROM ALL OF US OR NOT. PLEASE. GOOD MORNING AGAIN I'M FOR INSTANCE A FOR A VOTER IT'S ATTORNEY WITH THE ACLU OF CALIFORNIA AND ACLU IS PROUD TO CO SPONSOR AB SIX FORTY SIX BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THAT ALLOWING PEOPLE TO VOTE WHILE THEY'RE ON PAROLE MAKE OUR DEMOCRACY STRONGER. AND OUR COMMUNITIES SAFER. AS MENTIONED AB SIX FORTY SIX AS A COMPANION BILL TO A CA SIX AN ACA SIX A PLACE MEASURE ON THE TWENTY TWENTY BALLOT TO ELIMINATE PROLE DISENFRANCHISEMENT FROM THE STATE CONSTITUTION. AND AB SIX FORTY SIX WILL GO INTO EFFECT TO CLEAN UP THE ELECTIONS CODE ONLY IF THE MEASURE PASSES. AT THE LEGISLATION IS NEEDED NOT ONLY BECAUSE VOTING IS A FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT BUT ALSO BECAUSE IT'S AN ACTIVE COMMUNITY. RESTORING VOTING RIGHTS TO CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE ON PAROLE GIVES PEOPLE WERE RETURNING HOME A VOICE IN THE POLICIES THAT SHAPE THERE'S THEIR LIVES AND A STAKE IN THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS. IT'S NO WONDER THEN THAT STATES WITH YOUR BARE BARRIERS TO VOTING ALSO HAVE LOWER RATES OF RECIDIVISM. IN FACT A RECENT SURVEY FOUND THAT 76% OF CALIFORNIANS ON PAROLE SAID THAT VOTING WOULD HELP KEEP THEM OUT OF JAIL. PEARL DISENFRANCHISEMENT ISOLATES ARE FORMALLY INCARCERATED FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS CORD DISPROPORTIONATELY PEEPER PEOPLE OF COLOR. AND A CHILLS ELECTORAL PARTICIPATION OVERALL. BECAUSE CURRENT LAW ALLOWS PEOPLE ON SOME FORMS OF COMMUNITY SUPERVISION LIKE PROBATION AS WE DISCUSSED EARLIER TO ACCESS THE BALLOT BOX BUT IT BANS IT FOR PEOPLE -- ROLE CONFUSION INEVITABLY HOUSES SOME ELIGIBLE VOTERS TO STAY HOME INSTEAD OF GOING TO THE POLLS. EIGHTY SIX FORTY SIX ALONG WITH A CA SIX WILL MAKE CLEAR THAT ANY OTHERWISE ELIGIBLE ADULTS CAN VOTE ONCE THEY FINISH THEIR PRISON TERM. AND WILL MAKE A LITERAL THE ELECTORAL PROCESS STRONGER AND MORE INCLUSIVE FOR THESE REASONS WE RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THEY ARE GOOD AFTERNOON OR GOOD MORNING CHAIR AND MEMBERS ARE. MY NAME IS DARREN SUPERMAN -- SENIOR ORGANIZER WHAT ALL OF US NON COMPONENT PARTS OF RATED AND NOW I'M CRIMINAL PEROT. AND JUST A LITTLE BIT ABOUT ALL OF US NONE -- WE'RE GRASSROOTS ORGANIZATION FORMED BY PHONE ACROSS FOR THE PEOPLE TO RESTORE CIVIL HUMAN RIGHTS A FORMER CLASSMATE OF PEOPLE -- TODAY I'M HERE TO SPEAK OUT AGAINST FELONY DISENFRANCHISEMENT -- I'M FIFTY YEARS AGO. AND I VOTED ONE TIME IN MY ENTIRE LIFE. I CAN VIVIDLY REMEMBER THE DAY I ACTUALLY VOTED -- I WENT TO THE POLLS OF MY FATHER -- WE CAST OUR VOTE. AND AFTERWARD ON THE WAY HOME I REMEMBER HIM LOOKING AT ME SMILED AND I REMEMBER LOOK ON HIS FACE THE LOOK IN HIS EYE. I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND IT AT THE TIME OF EIGHTEEN YEARS AGO -- BUT HE WAS PROUD OF ME I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY BUT TODAY I FULLY UNDERSTAND WHAT I HAVE TWO SONS OF MY OWN. AND DOWN I WOULD LIKE TO EXPERIENCE THAT. THAT THAT YOU KNOW THAT FEELING HE HAD [inaudible] ARM. I SPENT TWENTY SIX YEARS IN THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT CORRECTION. I CURRENTLY HAVE FIVE YEARS OF PEROT -- I'VE BEEN HOME ABOUT TWO AND A HALF YEARS SO I HAVE TWO AND A HALF YEARS LEFT TO GO. SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT THAT IN TOTALITY BEST THIRTY ONE YEARS THIRTY ONE YEARS THE BALLOT BOX WE HAVE BEEN OUT OF REACH FOR ME. THIRTY ONE YEARS MY VOICE WILL HAVE BEEN SILENT -- I CONSIDER MYSELF A FIGURES IN -- I'M TOLD I'M A CITIZEN I'M COUNTING ON SINCE THAT A CITIZEN I MEAN I HAVE A VALID. BIRTH CERTIFICATE DRIVER'S LICENSE HEALTH CARE NUMBER ALL THESE THINGS ARE. I HAVE TO RESPONSIBILITIES AND BURDENS OF A CITIZEN -- I'M A TAXPAYING CITIZEN BUT I DON'T HAVE ANY REPRESENTATION. I HAVE NO SAY IN HOW MY TAX DOLLARS ARE SPENT I HAVE NO SAY IN WHAT ELECTED OFFICIAL REPRESENTS ME MY ISSUES. OF MY FAMILY FISHING ALL MY COMMUNITY. AND I HAVE TO ACT LIKE ONE TO MY ROOMS IN. AND MY RIGHTS BEGIN -- FOR FAR TOO LONG I BELIEVE THAT FELONY DISENFRANCHISEMENT HAVE. DEPRIVE -- AFRICAN AMERICAN AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR -- OF THE PHENOMENA RIGHT TO VOTE -- WE KNOW THAT. FELL IN ITS OPEN TITAN WAS ENACTED IN -- EIGHTEEN FORTY NINE AND IT WAS A STRATEGY -- TO POLITICALLY MARGINALIZED AFRICAN COMMUNITY AFTER AMERICAN COMMUNITY -- WE KNOW FELONY DISENFRANCHISEMENT SERVE NO LEGITIMATE LAW ENFORCEMENT PURPOSE NO PUBLIC POLICY PURPOSE NO PUBLIC SAFETY PURPOSES -- IT'S PURELY PUNITIVE AND IS ROOTED IN THE JIM CROW MENTALITY. PUMP THIS COUNTRY HERE THIS COUNTRY. OF THIS COUNTRY HAVE A HISTORY MARK [inaudible] ARM. BY SUCCESSFUL STRUGGLES -- TO EXPAND VOTING RIGHTS FOR DIFFERENT RACES AND GENDERS AND AND CLASSES. AND I THINK THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO CONTINUE TO BUILD ON THAT EXPANSION -- WE KNOW VOTING IS THE CORNERSTONE OF A DEMOCRACY WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY THAT YOU HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TODAY TO PROTECT THAT DEMOCRACY. WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO LET CALIFORNIA'S KNOW WHAT'S THAT IS AN ACROSS THIS NATION. NO THAT. OF DEMOCRACY IS ALL INCLUSIVE AND DEMOCRACY NEEDS EVERYONE. AND I'M ACTION YOU TODAY TO VOTE YES.

WOULD YOU LIKE TO MAKE A PRESENTATION OR JUST OPPOSITION PLEASE. UGH MY NAME IS KAREN POWERS. I AM A REPUBLICAN AND A TRUMP SUPPORTER. I RESPECT ALL OF YOU TODAY IT'S BEEN A VERY INTERESTING EXPERIENCE [inaudible] ALWAYS. YEAH -- I JUST WANTED TO SAY THAT ELECTION INTEGRITY PROJECT OF CALIFORNIA IS NOT IN SUPPORT OF THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SEE NO ADDITIONAL WITNESSES AND SUPPORT OPPOSITION BRING ABOUT A COLLEAGUES FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS MISTER ROYSTER. SO FIRST I WANT TO APPRECIATE THE TESTIMONY. FROM THE GENTLEMAN HERE AND AND YOU KNOW CERTAINLY I AYE ME OF SYMPATHIZE WITH WHAT YOU'RE SAYING WHICH IS THAT YOU WANT TO VOTE AND AND THAT EXPERIENCE THAT YOU HAVE WITH YOUR FATHER WHEN YOU FIRST. VOTED RIGHT AND THAT YOU WANT TO PARTICIPATE. IN OUR OUR REPUBLIC YOU KNOW AND BE PART OF THAT VOTING SYSTEM. THE WAY I LOOK AT THIS POLICY WISE IS THE I LOOK AT IT AS FOR PAROLE IS IS STILL PART OF SERVING YOUR SENTENCE YOU'RE YOU'RE. YOU'RE OUT BUT IT'S WERE WRONG PAROLE BECAUSE WE WANT TO SAY HEY WE ARE GOING TO ABIDE BY CERTAIN RULES THEY SHOW THAT. THAT WE ARE REHABILITATED MORE OF RAY TO GO BACK. YOU KNOW -- AND SO THE PAROLE IS REALLY. YEAH PART OF YOUR SENTENCE IN A WAY AND SO -- TO ME I THINK YOU KNOW ONCE PEARL IS COMPLETED. THEN YOU'RE VOTING RIGHTS ARE RESTORED AND WE SAY AS A SOCIETY OKAY. YOU READY TO TO TO VOTE AND PARTICIPATE IN A DEMOCRACY SO TO ME I I LOOK AT THAT IS JUST THAT WHOLE THAT WHOLE PROCESS RIGHT. AND IT SEEMS TO ME AS YOU'RE SAYING HERE TODAY THAT. HE OF EUROPEAN ABOUT WHATEVER IT WAS THAT CAUSE YOU TO BE INCARCERATED IN THE FIRST PLACE AND YOU WANT TO PARTICIPATE AGAIN AND THAT'S CERTAINLY. SOMETHING THAT I BELIEVE AND I THINK EVERYBODY PRIDE THAT EVERYBODY AT THIS TABLE BELIEVES IN I JUST SEE IT AS A POLICY MATTER THAT THAT SHOULD BE DONE AFTER PEARL IS COMPLETE. YOU'VE COMPLETED YOUR TERMS -- YOU'VE MET WITH ALL THE REQUIREMENTS OF YOUR PAROLE -- AND THEN I THINK ABSOLUTELY YOU KNOW YOU SHOULD BE PARTICIPATING IN R. N. N. AND ALL THOSE THINGS AND ALL OF YOUR RIGHTS HAVE BEEN FULLY RESTORED. SO THAT'S HOW I LOOK AT IT FROM A POLICY MATTERS. I DO HAVE TO FACT CHECK -- MY COLLEAGUES WHO I HAVE A LOT OF RESPECT -- FOR FROM SACRAMENTO -- BECAUSE THIS GOT BROUGHT I MEAN THIS HAS BEEN BROUGHT UP A LOT TO IT. THAT THE THAT SOMEHOW MAYBE THE PARTISAN BREAKDOWN IS THE SAME I GET IT THEY DID THE ONLY STUDY THAT HAS BEEN DONE. ON ON FLORIDA ACTUALLY -- IS THEY REVIEWED ONE POINT FIVE MILLION EX FELONS IN FLORIDA WHO COULD NOT VOTE -- PREVIOUSLY BUT WERE GIVEN RIGHTS TO VOTE A DECADE AGO UNDER CHARLIE CRIST. AND WHAT THEY WHAT THEY FOUND IN THAT STUDY. WAS THAT -- OF THE NINETEEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED EXPENSE HIS RIGHTS WERE RESTORED UNDER CRIST. ABOUT 58% WERE REGISTERED DEMOCRATS. 24% WERE REGISTERED REPUBLICANS. AND THE REST REGISTERED WITH NEITHER PARTY. SO THAT'S THE ONLY REAL STUDY WE SEE AS HOW THAT PARTISAN BREAKDOWN GETS MADE AND I JUST I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY DEFINITIVE PROOF -- MAYBE OTHER THAN JARED KUSHNER SAYING THAT -- YOU KNOW ON A ON A TV INTERVIEW. THAT THERE'S MORE REGISTERED REPUBLICANS -- YOU KNOW WHO ARE THAT. STRAIGHT AFTER THEY'VE HAD THEIR RIGHTSRESTORED AS FELL AND SO I JUST JUST FOR THE RECORD I MEAN THAT'S THE DATA THAT'S OUT THERE -- THEN THE LATEST CHANGE IN FLORIDA HAS NOT BEEN EVALUATED YET. BECAUSE THEY JUST HAVEN'T HAD ENOUGH TIME TO EVALUATE. I DON'T KNOW THAT THAT NECESSARILY MATTERS. I DON'T KNOW WHY WE NEED TO WOULD NECESSARILY TO BRING IT UP WHAT YOU'RE PARTISAN BREAKDOWN IS BUT JUST. THE FACTS OF WHAT WE'VE SEEN IS THAT. THEY DO TEND TO BE MORE REGISTER TO THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY. SO THE WAS RUSHER. ANY OTHER ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS IN COLLEAGUES ARE MOTIONS OR SECONDS. WELL YOU KNOW I I APPRECIATE THAT WHAT YOU'VE DONE AND I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT AS AS WE TALK ABOUT. THE CONCEPT OF BOATING AND GET PAST THE HISTORIC KIND OF REALITY THAT WE'VE HAD AS IT IN TERMS OF INCARCERATION AS A BEING A VERY PUNITIVE THING. THAT. HAS DONE MORE DESTRUCTION THAN THAN GOOD IN TERMS OF BUILDING INDIVIDUALS AND WE SEE THAT -- IN TERMS OF WHAT HAPPENS WITH RECIDIVISM AND WHAT HAPPENS WHEN PEOPLE ARE INCARCERATED AND DON'T GET THE OPPORTUNITY TO REBUILD THEIR LIVES TO COME BACK AND SO FORTH AND SO ON SO OUR JUDICIAL. ARE. OUR OUR PRISON SYSTEM HAS BEEN VERY DESTRUCTIVE -- IN IN A LOT OF WAYS IT HAS IN THIS SAY TO ME THIS ANY SAFER -- SURE THEY'RE PEOPLE WHO WILL ALWAYS HAVE TO GO TO PRISON BUT WE I THINK WE ALL RECOGNIZE TO SEVENTY STAND CALIFORNIA WE'VE OVER INCARCERATED. AND PART OF THAT MENTALITY IS AT ONE POINT WE DIDN'T WANT TO TAKE CLASSES WE DIDN'T WANT TO IMPROVE THEMSELVES AND NOW WE'RE COMING BACK FROM THERE THANK GOD. OF AND AND WE SHOULD BE MOVING TOWARD A POSITION WHERE PEOPLE STILL ALL HAVE RIGHTS AND STILL EXIST HAVE RIGHTS WENT WHEN THEY'RE INCARCERATED AS WELL. AND VOTING IS ONE OF THOSE MOST AND FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS IN THIS WHOLE COUNTRY WAS BUILT ON THE WHOLE ISSUE OF NO TAXATION WITHOUT REPRESENTATION. THAT WE SHOULD HAVE TO PAY FOR GOVERNMENT UNLESS WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY DECIDE WHO'S GOING TO REPRESENT US THAT'S A FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE THAT THAT STARTED THE REVOLUTION FOR THIS COUNTRY. NOW FOR ME PRO PEOPLE GET OUT OF PRISON ANYMORE EITHER IN PRISON ARE BEING TAXED THERE'S TAXATION NEW PAYING PROPERTY TAXES YOU'RE PAYING. OF SALES TAX YOU'RE BEING TAXED AND YET YOU CAN'T DEFINE OR DETERMINE WHAT PEOPLE UP HERE ARE GOING TO REPRESENT YOU IN TERMS OF THAT TAXATION. THAT'S A FUNDAMENTAL AMERICAN PRINCIPLES THAT WE HAVE SCHOOL IT OVER FOR FOR OVER FOUR HUNDRED YEARS IN TERMS OF NO TAXATION WITHOUT REPRESENTATION AND THAT IS A FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE OF THIS NATION. AND WHY WE SUPPOSEDLY BEGAN THIS DEMOCRATIC -- EXPERIMENT SO I I TOTALLY SUPPORT THE EFFORT I I YOU KNOW AND EVENTUALLY I THINK AT SOME POINT CALIFORNIA WILL GO FURTHER WHEN HE REALIZES WHAT IS RESPONSIBILITY IS TO ALL OF THE CITY OF CALIFORNIA. WHETHER THEY REGISTERED DEMOCRAT OR REPUBLICAN YOU KNOW WHATEVER IT IS BOB AND YOU KNOW SO I I THINK IT'S JUST A FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT AND AND PEOPLE HAVE THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE AND I THOROUGHLY SUPPORT THIS EFFORT. AND WILL SUPPORT THE ACA WHEN IT COMES BEFORE SO I'M WITH THE BILL THANK YOU DOCTOR WEBER I HAVE A MOTION LOOKING FOR A SECOND. I'VE GOT A TWO SECONDS. ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS AND COLLEAGUES SEEING NONE. MCCARTY WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE THANK YOU THAT THAT WAS A GREAT CLOSE BY BY DODD WHATEVER JUST ONE MORE AT ON THIS ISN'T JUST ABOUT VOTING. IT'S ABOUT RE INTEGRATING PEOPLE IN OUR SOCIETY IT'S A PUBLIC SAFETY ISSUE. IT WOULD YOU RATHER HAVE A PAROLE LEE -- IN YOUR COMMUNITY. STEWING BECAUSE THEY CAN'T GET A JOB BECAUSE THEY COULD FILL OUT APPLICATIONS ON PEROT THREW AWAY THEIR APPLICATION. STEWING IN THEIR IN THEIR HOUSE THEIR BASEMENT BECAUSE THEY CAN'T VOTE THEIR SECOND CLASS CITIZEN I THINK THE PRISON SYSTEM SAYS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE SAFE ENOUGH TO BE OUT THERE IN THE COMMUNITY. AND IT DOES A DISSERVICE BY HAVING FRAWLEY'S AS SECOND CLASS CITIZENS THIS IS ABOUT REAP SAFELY REINTEGRATING PEOPLE INTO OUR SOCIETY. THAT'S AN IMPORTANT ELEMENT TO THIS EFFORT ASK THE RIGHT BOOK THANK YOU MISTER MCCARTY ELATED -- FIGURING BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD I KNOW THAT THIS BILLS ONLY THE IMPLEMENTING LEGISLATION AC SIX AND WILL ONLY BECOME OPERATIVE VOTERS APPROVED A CA. SIX BUT IT'S IMPORTANT ON THE LESS AND I EXPECT WE'LL HAVE A LENGTHY DISCUSSION OR MAYBE NOT ABOUT THIS POLICY WHEN THE COMMITTEE CONSIDERS A CA SIX I AM AND I JUST WAS OUT I DIDN'T REFLEXIVELY. SUPPORT THIS WHEN I FIRST HEARD ABOUT IT I WENT BACK AND I DID SOME RESEARCH I DID SOME RESEARCH ON WHAT OTHER STATES ACROSS THE COUNTRY DID DID A LITTLE THINKING ABOUT. THE CONCEPT OF HAVING PAROLEES HAVE THE RIGHT TO VOTE AND IT'S TRUE. YEAH WE PEARL IS ONE MORE STEP TO HAVING ALL OF YOUR RIGHTS -- IT REINSTATED AND IT'S NOT THE SAME AS BEING IN PRISON OBVIOUSLY AND SO I THINK IT MAKES SENSE. TO AT TO ADD THE RIGHT TO VOTE. TO BE ONE OF THOSE RISE THAT'S REINSTATED WHEN YOU'RE ON PAROLE AND AND FINISHING UP YOUR SENTENCE -- BUT WHEN IT'S BEEN IDENTIFIED THAT YOU KNOW YOU YOU YOU NO LONGER. SERVE WITHOUT TO SOCIETY YOU'VE YOU PAID A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF THE DUES OF FROM THE CRIME THAT YOU COMMITTED -- BUT WE DO REALLY WANT TO RE INTEGRATE EVERYBODY BACK INTO SOCIETY AND REDUCE THE RECIDIVISM THAT WE SEE AND AND HAVE PEOPLE HAVE PRIDE -- IN ENGAGING -- IN OUR SOCIETY AND AND THE RIGHT TO VOTE IS IN VOTING IS IS ONE OF THE BEST WAYS TO DO THAT SO. I THINK IT MAKES SENSE -- AND I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT TODAY. AND I'M SECRETARY PLEASE -- CALL VOTE. AT THE MOTIONS TO PASS AND RE REFER TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS BERMAN I BERMAN I'D GALLAGHER [inaudible] SHARON. LOW. NO I MAYES. MULLIN. MULLIN AYE WEBER. WEBER I THAT IS OUT ON THE FOUR OH VOTE WILL KEEP THE ROLE OPEN FOR ABSENT MEMBERS THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU CAN HAVE AN THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK THANK YOU. YES. AND SOMETHING WE'RE CERVANTES BELIEVE YOU GOT TO BILLS. ITEMS ONE IN THREE AND IN THE MEANTIME I'D LIKE TO ANNOUNCE THAT ITEM FIVE AB -- FOR SIXTY WAS PULLED AT THE REQUEST OF THE AUTHOR -- AND I'M GOING TO HAND THIS OFF TO US A MEMBER LOW JUST FOR TWO MINUTES [inaudible] YEAH. MISTER CHAIR IF I COULD START WITH AB FORTY NINE I WANT TO START BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS AS OUTLINED ON PAGE FOR THE ANALYSIS. ON AND THINK ARE THE COMMITTEE STAFF IN THE CHAIR FOR THEIR ASSISTANCE ON THIS BILL. IN A REPRESENTATIVE DEMOCRACY LIKE OURS NOTHING IS MORE FUNDAMENTAL THAN PROTECTING AND PROMOTING THE RIGHT TO VOTE. OUR STATE ELECTION LAWS HAVE BEEN BODY THIS BY MAKING VOTING BY MAIL EASIER AND MORE ACCESSIBLE. AS A RESULT MORE MORE CALIFORNIA VOTERS ARE CHOOSING TO EXERCISE THEIR RIGHT TO VOTE BY MAIL THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN MID TERM ELECTIONS MORE THAN 65% OF CALIFORNIANS. USED VOTE BY MAIL AS OUR PRIMARY OPTION IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT OUR STATE LAWS REFLECT THIS GROW REALITY. HOWEVER SADLY DURING THOSE SAME MID TERM ELECTIONS IT BECAME EVIDENT THAT THERE ARE FLAWS IN OUR SYSTEM THAT MUST BE FIXED. THERE ARE MANY INSTANCES OF VOTERS WHO DO NOT RECEIVE THEIR BALLOTS IN A TIMELY MANNER. INDEED IN MY DISTRICT THAT I REPRESENT MANY CASES OF VOTERS IN WHICH THEY DID NOT RECEIVE THEIR BALLOT UP UNTIL THE DAY BEFORE THE ELECTION ON ELECTION DAY OR DID NOT RECEIVE THEIR VOTE. THERE BALLOT AT ALL. SOME VOTERS EXCEEDING THE CALIFORNIA VOTER PROTECTION ACT WILL HELP FIX THIS IN TWO WAYS FIRST IT WILL REQUIRE COUNTY REGISTRARS TO COMPLETE THE DISTRIBUTION OF MAIL BALLOTS TOO EARLY BUT BY MAIL REGISTRANTS WITHIN FIVE DAYS. OF WHEN THEY ACTUALLY WHEN THEY BEGIN TO SEND THOSE BALLOTS OUT WHICH CURRENTLY IS TWENTY NINE DAYS UGH. IN CURRENT LAW BEFORE ELECTION DAY LET ME BE CLEAR THIS IS NOT CHANGED THE EXISTING TIMELINE WHEN A BALLOT MUST BE SENT OUT. IT ONLY REQUIRES THAT THESE BALLOTS BE MAILED OUT WITHIN FIVE DAYS. BY ENSURING THE EARLY REGISTRANTS -- OUR CENTER BALLOT WITHIN FIVE DAYS OF THE EXISTING THRESHOLD WE WILL MAKE IT MORE LIKELY THAT VOTERS RECEIVE THEIR BALLOT ON TIME. THIS WILL ALLOW THEM TO PROPERLY EXERCISE THEIR RIGHT TO VOTE AND GIVE THEM THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADEQUATELY DO THEIR RESEARCH. SECOND TO ONE AMENDED THIS BILL WILL ALSO REQUIRE THAT. THERE ARE VOTER VOTE CENTERS IN EACH ASSEMBLY DISTRICTS -- I HAVE WILL BE TAKEN COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS -- IN THE NEXT COMMITTEE TO ADDRESS CONCERNS THAT WERE OUTLINED IN THE ANALYSIS I IN WHICH THE COUNTY HAS TO INCLUDE AT LEAST FIFTY THOUSAND REGISTERED VOTERS. I IN DOING SO. WE ARE GIVING MORE OPPORTUNITIES. ACCESSIBILITY TO ALL VOTERS IN CALIFORNIA I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE ON THIS MEASURE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES WISHING TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT. FIFTH MELISSA ROMERO WITH THE CALIFORNIA LEAGUE OF CONSERVATION VOTERS AND SUPPORT. THE SHOW WENT ALONG ON BEHALF OF SECRETARY STATE ALEX BUT THE YET NO FORMAL POSITION YET BUT I'M GONNA THINK THE AUTHOR ON THE RECENT AMENDMENTS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT SEEN ON ANY WITNESSES WISHING TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION. GOOD MORNING THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ASSEMBLYMEMBER LOW MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I'M RYAN ROCCO -- IT THE I AM THE PLASTER COUNTY COURT CARTER REGISTAR VOTERS AND I'M ALSO ALLEGED THAT LEGEND COMMITTEE CO CHAIR FOR THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF COURSE ELECTIONS OFFICIALS. JUST WANTED TO SAY THAT.

I THINK WE'LL GO IN A NUMERICAL ORDER STARTING WITH FIVE SEVEN ONE GREAT. LOVE FOR HIM PAYING CONTRIBUTION LIMITS THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS. CALIFORNIA IS ONE OF THE VERY FEW STATES THAT HAVE STATE CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS LIMITS BUT NO LOCAL. CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTION LIMITS WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT UNLESS A LOCAL GOVERNMENT ADOPTED SOME CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTION LIMITS LITERALLY ANY AMOUNT CAN BE CONTRIBUTED DIRECTLY TO A CANDIDATE FOR LOCAL OFFICE. WE'VE SEEN EXAMPLES OF CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS RECEIVING DIRECT CONTRIBUTIONS FROM A SINGLE DONOR. THAT ARE HIGHER THAN THE AVERAGE CALIFORNIANS ANNUAL SALARY EVEN SINGLE CONTRIBUTIONS AS HIGH AS A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS CONTRIBUTIONS OF THIS MAGNITUDE UNDERMINE PUBLIC TRUST IN OUR DEMOCRACY. THIS BILL CREATES A REASONABLE DEFAULT CONTRIBUTION LIMIT TO STOP EXCESSIVE CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS FOR CITY AND COUNTY RACES WHILE ALSO RESPECTING LOCAL CONTROL AB FIVE SEVEN ONE ESTABLISHES DEFAULT CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTION LIMITS OF FORTY SEVEN HUNDRED DOLLARS. AT THE LOCAL LEVEL FOR CITIES AND COUNTIES THAT HAVE NOT ADOPTED THEIR OWN CONTRIBUTION LIMITS IT'S SOMETHING OF A BACKSTOP WERE. GOING TO BE PUTTING INTO LAW HOPEFULLY. THIS IS THE EXACT SAME AMOUNT AS THE STATE INDIVIDUAL CONTRIBUTION LIMITS WE ARE BOUND TO WITH THE ASSEMBLY IN THE SENATE. IT SUPPORT DISTRESS THAT AB FIVE SEVEN ONE MAINTAINS COMPLETE LOCAL CONTROL AT ANY POINT EVEN TWENTY YEARS FROM NOW. A LOCAL JURISDICTION CAN OPT OUT BY ENACTING ITS OWN CONTRIBUTION LIMITS. WHETHER LOWER OR HIGHER THAN THE DEFAULT LIMIT SO WITH ME TODAY'S NECKLACE HEIGHT ON WITH CALIFORNIA COMMONSENSE TO OFFER ADDITIONAL COMMENTS IN SUPPORT THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THERE IS A BIPARTISAN MOTION AND SECOND -- CHAIR NICKEL SEVEN WITH CALIFORNIA COME BECAUSE OF JUST BE BRIEF WE THINK UNLIMITED DONATIONS ARE PROBLEM FOR DEMOCRACY THE OPEN DOOR CORRUPTION PAID PLAYING AND CREATE THE PARENTS SPECIAL INTERESTS CONTROL.

IT'S BEEN A LONG MORNING. WHERE AM I THIRTEEN GOT IT THIS IS STILL A GOOD BILL FOR THE RECORD? I WANT TO THANK THE OTHER FOR HIS WILLINGNESS TO ACCEPT THE AMENDMENTS THAT ARE SUGGESTED IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS THE DISCLOSE ACT AND LAST YEAR SOCIAL MEDIAS CLOSE ACT OR LANDMARK REFORMS THAT HELP GIVE VOTERS IMPORTANT INFORMATION. ABOUT THE FUNDERS OF CAMPAIGN ADVERTISEMENTS SO IT'S VITAL THAT WE TAKE THE NECESSARY STEPS TO ENSURE THAT THOSE LAWS CAN BE EFFECTIVELY IMPLEMENTED AND ENFORCED. THAT'S WHY I'M RECOMMENDING SUPPORT WITH THE AMENDMENTS MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE VOTE. THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED AND WE REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS BERMAN HI. BERMAN I GALLAGHER. CALDERON CALDERON I'D LOW. LOW AYE MAYES. MAYES AYE MULLIN AYE MULLIN AYE WEBER. WEBER I GREAT THE BILL IS OUT ON THE SIX OF A WILL LEAVE IT OPEN FOR ABSENT MEMBERS AND MOVING ON TO ASSEMBLY -- TO ITEM NUMBER EIGHTEEN AB. FIFTEEN SEVENTY FOUR GOT A MOTION AND SECOND THING MATURES SAVE THE WEIGHTY ONE FOR LAST THIS IS A BE FIFTEEN SEVENTY FOUR ON LOBBYING EXPENDITURE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS. FIFTEEN SEVENTY FOUR WOULD INCREASE TRANSPARENCY OF LOBBYING EXPENDITURE DISCLOSURES MAKING IT EASIER FOR THE PUBLIC TO SEE WHICH ENTITIES ARE SEEKING TO INFLUENCE POLICY MOVING THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE. CURRENTLY LOBBYING ENTITIES ARE REQUIRED TO REPORT EXPENDITURES TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE ON A QUARTERLY BASIS FOUR TIMES A YEAR. ALTHOUGH THE INFORMATION IN THESE EXPENDITURE REPORTS BECOMES PUBLICLY AVAILABLE OF EVENTUALLY IT TYPICALLY TAKES WEEKS EVEN LONGER THAN A MONTH. FOR INSTANCE AT PEAK LOBBY ACTIVITY DURING THE MONTH OF AUGUST TOWARD THE END OF SESSION. IT COULD BE AS LATE AS OCTOBER BEFORE LOBBYING EXPENDITURE REPORTS FOR THAT PERIOD BECOME AVAILABLE FOR THE PUBLIC TO REVIEW FAR AFTER VOTES ARE CAST IN THE LEGISLATIVE SESSION HAS CONCLUDED. THIS LAG AVAILABILITY OF INFORMATION IS NOT ACHIEVING FULL TRANSPARENCY THE PUBLIC DESERVES TO KNOW WHO IS SEEKING TO INFLUENCE THE LEGISLATURE IN A TIMELY MANNER. WHILE THE BILL IN ITS CURRENT FORM WOULD REQUIRE MONTHLY REPORTS THROUGHOUT THE CALENDAR YEAR MY FOCUS IS TIMELY REPORTING DURING SESSION AT THOSE PEAK TIMES AND I AM CURRENTLY WORKING WITH STAKEHOLDERS. TO COME UP WITH AN APPROACH AS BOTH REASONABLE FOR THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR DOING THIS REPORTING YET MUCH MORE TRANSPARENT AND TIMELY THAN THE STATUS QUO. I THANK THE POLITICAL TREASURES ASSOCIATION FOR THEIR INPUT THUS FAR IN THE FOR DEVELOPING AMENDMENTS WITH THE HELP OF THEIR FEEDBACK. WE ARE AWAITING RESPONSE FROM THE SECRETARY OF STATE'S OFFICE TO ENSURE THAT THE BILL IN ITS FINAL FORM IS CONDUCIVE AND NOT IN CONFLICT WITH THE REVAMP. AND RELAUNCH OF CAL ACCESS IN TWENTY TWENTY SO WE'LL SEE WE WILL WORK THROUGH THOSE ISSUES IT IS INTERESTING TO NOTE AND I THANK. EATEN THE COMMITTEE STAFFER FOR WORKING THROUGH THESE ISSUES OF THE ORIGINAL P. R. A. REQUIRED MONTHLY REPORTING DURING SESSION YET WAS AMENDED BACK TO QUARTERLY IN. NINETEEN SEVENTY NINE I DON'T KNOW THE HISTORY ON THAT PARTICULAR ADJUSTMENT TO QUARTERLY HOWEVER BUT IN THIS AGE OF ONLINE DISCLOSURE WE SHOULD GO BACK TO THE FUTURE AND REQUIRE MORE TIMELY REPORTING. WHEN LOBBYING IS AT ITS PEAK DURING SESSION AND I ASKED FOR AN AYE VOTE? THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AND JUST TO CONFIRM -- WILL YOU BE ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS IN COMMON WITH EVERY ANALYSIS THANK YOU. ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. ANY WINNERS -- FOR SUPPORT AND THEN WE'RE GONNA TRAINERS AND SUPPORT. YES KEVIN WOLF -- CABINET THE MANY CAMPAIGN IN SUPPORT THANK YOU VERY MUCH WINNERS. MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS TERRY THE TWEENER FROM MY S. YEAH YOU CALIFORNIA AFTER CONVERSATIONS WITH THE AUTHOR.

MS MULLIN WE LIKE TO CLOSE AS FOR NAY VOTE AWESOME I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE'S PROPOSED AMENDMENT TO ENSURE THAT THIS BILL GOES DOES NOT INTERFERE WITH THE ORDERLY IMPLEMENTATION OF THE CAL ACCESS REPLACEMENT SYSTEM. THIS BILL WILL HELP IMPROVE TRANSPARENCY OF LOBBYING EXPENDITURES DURING KEY POINTS IN THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS AND I KNOW THE AUTHORS OPEN CONTINUE TO REFINE THIS BILL. TO MINIMIZE ANY ADDITIONAL BURDEN TO ACHIEVING THAT IMPROVE TRANSPARENCY SO WITH THAT I'M HAPPY TO RECOMMEND SUPPORT OF THE BILL OF SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE VOTE. THE MOST IS TO PASS AS AMENDED AND RE REFER TO THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE BERMAN HI BERMAN AYE GALLAGHER. CALDERON CALDERON AYE LOW. NO I MAYES MAYES AYE MULLIN AYE MULLIN AYE WEBER.

AND THEN ALSO THE PAID SIGNATURE GATT. YEAH THE PIT SIGNATURE GATHERS IN BEING PAID ON A PER SIGNATURE BASIS AND BANNING THAT WE ARE POSTED THAT IS WE'VE OPPOSE THE BILL IN PREVIOUS YEARS. YOU KNOW WE'RE CONCERNED THAT PAYING ON AN HOURLY RATE WHICH OBVIOUSLY THIS BILL WOULD LEAD TO HAVE PAID SIGNATURE IF BEING PAID PER SIGNATURE IS -- GOTTEN RIGHT OF YOU KNOW COULD ACTUALLY LEAD TO MORE MONEY IN POLITICS AND I KNOW THIS IS AN ARGUMENT THAT'S BEEN MADE BEFORE IN THIS COMMITTEE WE THINK THAT HOLDS WATER. THERE'S REALLY NO COMPELLING EVIDENCE THAT WE CAN FIND A SIGNATURE GATHERING FRAUD EITHER AND SO FOR ALL THOSE REASONS AND WITH RESPECT TO THE CHAIRMAN'S UPCOMING WEDDING AND WANTING HIM TO LEAVE I'M GONNA GET OUT OF HERE I SUPERNOVA.
