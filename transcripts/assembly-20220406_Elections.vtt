00:48:33.543 --> 00:48:35.646
STEP AS WELL IN PART OF THIS

00:48:35.712 --> 00:48:36.613
PROCESS IS ACTUALLY ALLOWING FOR

00:48:36.680 --> 00:48:38.548
DIALOGUE FOR THESE YOUNG

00:48:38.615 --> 00:48:40.250
INDIVIDUALS TO TALK TO ELECTED

00:48:40.317 --> 00:48:42.019
OFFICIALS TO UNDERSTAND. PART OF

00:48:42.085 --> 00:48:43.854
WITH THE DATA WILL SHOW IS THAT

00:48:43.920 --> 00:48:46.523
YOUNG PEOPLE- DON'T AND VOTERS

00:48:46.590 --> 00:48:47.991
IN GENERAL BUT ESPECIALLY YOUNG

00:48:48.058 --> 00:48:50.560
PEOPLE THEY DON'T FOCUS MUCH. ON

00:48:50.627 --> 00:48:52.629
A PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION CYCLES

00:48:52.696 --> 00:48:54.298
SO OUR EFFORT HERE THAT WE'RE

00:48:54.364 --> 00:48:56.099
PLANNING ON DOING IS ENGAGING

00:48:56.166 --> 00:48:57.467
YOUNG VOTERS SO THAT THEY CAN

00:48:57.534 --> 00:48:59.670
START TO LEARN THE IMPORTANCE OF

00:48:59.736 --> 00:49:00.337
LOCAL GOVERNMENT. THE IMPORTANCE

00:49:00.404 --> 00:49:03.173
OF THE STATE LEVEL ELECTIONS TO

00:49:03.240 --> 00:49:04.508
UNDERSTAND THAT THE DECISIONS

00:49:04.574 --> 00:49:05.742
BEING MADE HERE IMPACT THEM

00:49:05.809 --> 00:49:07.477
SIGNIFICANTLY THAT'S WHY THE

00:49:07.544 --> 00:49:09.146
DATA SHOWS THAT THE VOTED A

00:49:09.212 --> 00:49:10.347
PRESIDENTIAL IT'LL DROP OFF

00:49:10.414 --> 00:49:11.448
SIGNIFICANTLY IN NON

00:49:11.515 --> 00:49:13.350
PRESIDENTIAL. SO THE EFFORT THAT

00:49:13.417 --> 00:49:14.584
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TERMS OF

00:49:14.651 --> 00:49:15.752
ENGAGING OUR YOUNG PEOPLE

00:49:15.819 --> 00:49:17.321
DEVELOPING THE CURRICULUM WILL

00:49:17.387 --> 00:49:19.056
BE ENGAGING THEM ON THAT LOCAL

00:49:19.122 --> 00:49:21.258
LEVEL SO. YOU KNOW LOOK POLITICS

00:49:21.325 --> 00:49:23.093
IS LOCAL AND WRITING ABLE TO

00:49:23.160 --> 00:49:24.828
UNDERSTAND THAT WILL ENGAGE THEM

00:49:24.895 --> 00:49:26.229
IN A WAY THAT THEY'VE NEVER BEEN

00:49:26.296 --> 00:49:27.264
ENGAGED BEFORE TO HAVE THAT

00:49:27.331 --> 00:49:29.199
VOICE. TO ONE OF BOTH AND

00:49:29.266 --> 00:49:30.267
PARTICIPATED A HIGHER LEVEL

00:49:30.334 --> 00:49:31.902
MOVING FORWARD YEAH. I THINK

00:49:31.968 --> 00:49:34.004
CIVICS CLASS. IS ONE OF THE

00:49:34.071 --> 00:49:36.907
REQUIRED CLASSES AND IN HIGH

00:49:36.973 --> 00:49:38.675
SCHOOL. AND IF WE'RE NOT DOING

00:49:38.742 --> 00:49:40.610
THAT DURING CIVICS CLASS. AND

00:49:40.677 --> 00:49:42.512
WE'RE MAKING IT. AND YOU KNOW

00:49:42.579 --> 00:49:44.314

QUARTER OF. A SEMESTER RELATED

00:49:53.357 --> 00:49:55.592
TO CIVICS. AND I THINK IT'S A

00:49:55.659 --> 00:49:56.793
BIG PIECE THAT WE'RE MISSING AS

00:49:56.860 --> 00:49:58.762
WELL- I THINK THIS IS AN

00:49:58.829 --> 00:50:00.364
OPPORTUNITY THAT WE HAVE SEEN BY

00:50:00.430 --> 00:50:01.798

01:24:29.197 --> 01:24:32.000
AND A DEMOCRACY. TO DO THE DUTY

01:24:32.066 --> 01:24:33.968
THAT WHICH IS THE PEOPLE'S IT

01:24:34.035 --> 01:24:35.537
FAILS. NOW SAY THAT AGAIN.

01:24:35.603 --> 01:24:37.639
ANYTIME WE CREATE AMERICA AND A

01:24:37.705 --> 01:24:39.374
MECHANISM IN A DEMOCRACY TO DO

01:24:39.441 --> 01:24:41.309
THE DUTY THAT WHICH IS THE

01:24:41.376 --> 01:24:43.311
PEOPLE'S. IT FAILS. TERM LIMITS

01:24:43.378 --> 01:24:45.213
ARE A GREAT EXAMPLE OF THAT. HAS

01:24:45.280 --> 01:24:46.481
LIMITING THOSE WHO CAN BE

01:24:46.548 --> 01:24:48.016
ELECTED BEEN THE GREAT FIX

01:24:48.082 --> 01:24:50.919
EVERYBODY IS SEEKING I THANK NOT

01:24:50.985 --> 01:24:53.021
. AND WHAT IS THAT GREAT FIX.

01:24:53.087 --> 01:24:54.255
MAINLY IT'S IN THE EYE OF THE

01:24:54.322 --> 01:24:55.957
BEHOLDER BUT NOT NECESSARILY

01:24:56.024 --> 01:24:58.593
BEHOLDEN TO THE BASIC TENETS OF

01:24:58.660 --> 01:25:01.095
DEMOCRACY. IN SHORT OUR FOUNDING

01:25:01.162 --> 01:25:02.597
FATHERS NEVER CONTEMPLATED THAT

01:25:02.664 --> 01:25:05.066
WE WOULD CONJURE UP A SHORT CUT

01:25:05.133 --> 01:25:07.001
IN ORDER TO BETTER OUR

01:25:07.068 --> 01:25:07.836
DEMOCRACY. BUT HERE WE ARE

01:25:07.902 --> 01:25:09.437
DISCUSSING RANKED CHOICE VOTING

01:25:09.504 --> 01:25:11.172
WHICH I'M ARGUING TODAY IS A

01:25:11.239 --> 01:25:12.841
SHORT CUT AND CHEAPENS THE MOCK

01:25:12.907 --> 01:25:14.676
CHRISSY AND THE EFFORTS OF THOSE

01:25:14.742 --> 01:25:16.744
WHO HAVE SOUGHT TO PROTECTED

01:25:16.811 --> 01:25:19.180
AROUND THE GLOBE. FIRST WHAT IS

01:25:19.247 --> 01:25:22.584
RANKED CHOICE VOTING. WELL IT'S

01:25:22.650 --> 01:25:24.686
HARD TO EXPLAIN SO THERE'S THE

01:25:24.752 --> 01:25:26.421
FIRST PROBLEM. IT IS DIFFERENT

01:25:26.488 --> 01:25:28.189
THAN A STANDARD ELECTION WHEREIN

01:25:28.256 --> 01:25:29.724
THE ONE WHO GETS THE MOST VOTES

01:25:29.791 --> 01:25:31.593
WINS OR MOVES ON TO A RUNOFF.

01:25:31.659 --> 01:25:34.028
IT'S VERY DIFFERENT. AS YOU MAY

01:25:34.095 --> 01:25:35.897
BE AWARE RANKED CHOICE VOTING IS

01:25:35.964 --> 01:25:37.632
THE PROCESS WHEREIN VOTERS ARE

01:25:37.699 --> 01:25:39.033
ASKED TO RANK THEIR CANDIDATES

01:25:39.100 --> 01:25:40.902
IN ORDER OF PREFERENCE. INSTEAD

01:25:40.969 --> 01:25:42.837
OF VOTING FOR A SINGLE CANDIDATE

01:25:42.904 --> 01:25:43.805
AND ALLOWING THE CANDIDATE GETS

01:25:43.872 --> 01:25:45.773
THE MOST VOTES TO BE THE VICTOR.

01:25:45.840 --> 01:25:48.676
OR TO GO WORK TO GO FOR TO A

01:25:48.743 --> 01:25:50.345
RUNOFF. WITH RANKED CHOICE

01:25:50.411 --> 01:25:52.180
VOTING SHOULD NO CANDIDATE

01:25:52.247 --> 01:25:54.215
ACHIEVE A MATE MAJORITY VOTE THE

01:25:54.282 --> 01:25:56.050
LOWEST VOTE EARNING CANDIDATE.

01:25:56.117 --> 01:25:57.218
IS ELIMINATED AND THE VOTERS

01:25:57.285 --> 01:25:59.120
NEXT PREFERRED CANDIDATE IS

01:25:59.187 --> 01:26:01.256
COUNTED INSTEAD. THE PROCESS

01:26:01.322 --> 01:26:03.424
CONTINUES AND ROUNDS. AND IT

01:26:03.491 --> 01:26:05.260
REPEATS UNTIL A CANDIDATE HAS A

01:26:05.326 --> 01:26:06.294
MAJORITY OF VOTES IN THE

01:26:06.361 --> 01:26:08.062
ELECTION. THERE COULD BE MANY

01:26:08.129 --> 01:26:09.797
ROOM THERE COULD BE MANY ROUNDS

01:26:09.864 --> 01:26:11.466
OF VOTERS MAY VOTE MANY TIMES

01:26:11.533 --> 01:26:14.168
FOR JUST AN OFFICE. SO AGAIN

01:26:14.235 --> 01:26:15.470
RANK CHOICE VOTING REQUIRES

01:26:15.537 --> 01:26:16.871
VOTERS TO RANK CANDIDATES IN

01:26:16.938 --> 01:26:18.806
ORDER OF PREFERENCE OF NOBLE IF

01:26:18.873 --> 01:26:20.041
NO CANDIDATE IN ROUND ONE

01:26:20.108 --> 01:26:21.743
RECEIVES 50% OF THE FIRST PLACE

01:26:21.809 --> 01:26:23.711
VOTES THE ONE RECEIVING THE

01:26:23.778 --> 01:26:25.179
FEWEST VOTES IS ELIMINATED. AND

01:26:25.246 --> 01:26:27.115
THAT CONTENDERS SECOND PLACE

01:26:27.181 --> 01:26:28.483
VOTES ARE ALLOCATED TO THE

01:26:28.550 --> 01:26:30.418
REMAINING CANDIDATES. THESE RE

01:26:30.485 --> 01:26:31.986
OUT THESE ROUNDS REALLOCATING

01:26:32.053 --> 01:26:33.321
SECOND THIRD OR FOURTH PLACE

01:26:33.388 --> 01:26:35.957
VOTES OR MORE FROM THE BOTTOM UP

01:26:36.024 --> 01:26:38.359
CONTINUE. UNTIL ONE CANDIDATE.

01:26:38.426 --> 01:26:41.162
GETS A MAJORITY CONFUSED. YOU

01:26:41.229 --> 01:26:43.131
SHOULD BE BECAUSE SORT OF VOTERS

01:26:43.197 --> 01:26:44.999
. IN ESSENCE IT IS ONE PERSON

01:26:45.066 --> 01:26:47.402
MANY VOTES NOT ONE PERSON ONE

01:26:47.468 --> 01:26:50.104
VOTE. BUT WHY SUPPORT RANKED

01:26:50.171 --> 01:26:52.440
CHOICE VOTING AND I MET WITH

01:26:52.507 --> 01:26:53.241
SOME OF THE SUPPORTERS NO LAW

01:26:53.308 --> 01:26:54.576
ALL SUPPORTERS BUT THESE ARE

01:26:54.642 --> 01:26:56.444
SOME OF THE THINGS I HEARD- AND

01:26:56.511 --> 01:26:58.446
WHY THEY SUPPORTED RANKED CHOICE

01:26:58.513 --> 01:27:00.615
VOTING. IT SAVES MONEY BECAUSE

01:27:00.682 --> 01:27:02.917
THERE WILL ONLY BE ONE ELECTION

01:27:02.984 --> 01:27:04.052
AND MY RESPONSE TO THAT IS

01:27:04.118 --> 01:27:05.386
SIMPLE. WE'RE GOING TO ALTER

01:27:05.453 --> 01:27:07.221
DEMOCRACY JUST TO MAKE ELECTIONS

01:27:07.288 --> 01:27:09.057
CHEAPER. NOBODY SAID DEMOCRACY

01:27:09.123 --> 01:27:12.093
WAS FREE. AND WE CAN AFFORD

01:27:12.160 --> 01:27:14.862
ELECTIONS. ANOTHER REASON RANK

01:27:14.929 --> 01:27:16.331
CHOICE VOTING IS MORE CONVENIENT

01:27:16.397 --> 01:27:18.066
FOR PEOPLE ON THEY WILL NOT HAVE

01:27:18.132 --> 01:27:19.767
TO FILL OUT ANOTHER BALLOT IN A

01:27:19.834 --> 01:27:21.569
RUN OFF MY RESPONSE TO THAT.

01:27:21.636 --> 01:27:23.104
DEMOCRACY IS NOT ALWAYS

01:27:23.171 --> 01:27:24.706
CONVENIENT AND WE SHOULD NOT

01:27:24.772 --> 01:27:26.407
CHEAP IN THE ELECTORAL PROCESS

01:27:26.474 --> 01:27:28.676
JUST TO APPEASE THOSE WHO DON'T

01:27:28.743 --> 01:27:29.944
NOT WANT TO BE INCONVENIENCED

01:27:30.011 --> 01:27:32.313
WITH VOTING. VOTING IS A CIVIC

01:27:32.380 --> 01:27:36.684
DUTY NOT A CIVIC BOTHERED. NEXT

01:27:36.751 --> 01:27:38.753
RANK CHOICE VOTING HELPS ME GET

01:27:38.820 --> 01:27:40.221
THOSE THAT SUPPORT MY CAUSE IS

01:27:40.288 --> 01:27:42.390
MORE EASILY ELECTED ESSENTIALLY

01:27:42.457 --> 01:27:43.925
SPECIAL INTERESTS CAN BETTER

01:27:43.992 --> 01:27:46.828
CONTROL THE OUTCOME. I BELIEVE

01:27:46.894 --> 01:27:48.796
THAT STATEMENT SPEAKS FOR ITSELF

01:27:48.863 --> 01:27:50.098
. THEY OFFER MENTION ARGUMENTS

01:27:50.164 --> 01:27:52.133
ARE NOT REFLECTIVE OF DEMOCRATIC

01:27:52.200 --> 01:27:54.602
VALUES. BUT I'VE CONVENIENCE AND

01:27:54.669 --> 01:27:57.672
I FIND THAT UNFORTUNATE. NOW THE

01:27:57.739 --> 01:27:58.740
PROBLEMS WITH DRINK CHOICE

01:27:58.806 --> 01:28:00.608
VOTING. NUMBER ONE VOTER

01:28:00.675 --> 01:28:03.378
CONFUSION HEY ASKING VOTERS TO

01:28:03.444 --> 01:28:04.946
RANK THEIR CHOICES INSTEAD OF

01:28:05.013 --> 01:28:06.280
CHOOSING A SINGLE CANDIDATE

01:28:06.347 --> 01:28:08.449
CONFUSES VOTERS WHO ARE USED TO

01:28:08.516 --> 01:28:10.852
THE DEMOCRATIC CONCEPT OF THE

01:28:10.918 --> 01:28:12.854
ONE WITH THE MOST VOTES WINS.

01:28:12.920 --> 01:28:15.223
STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THIS DYNAMIC

01:28:15.289 --> 01:28:16.224
IMPACTS MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES

01:28:16.290 --> 01:28:18.760
MOST. ENGLISH LEARNERS AND THOSE

01:28:18.826 --> 01:28:20.094
WHO HAVE ACCESS TO MAINSTREAM

01:28:20.161 --> 01:28:22.630
MEDIA OR AN EDUCATION CAMPAIGN

01:28:22.697 --> 01:28:24.098
MAY BE TAKING PLACE ARE LEFT TO

01:28:24.165 --> 01:28:25.900
FIGURE IT OUT FOR THEMSELVES I

01:28:25.967 --> 01:28:27.268
GIVE THE EXAMPLE OF THAT FROM MY

01:28:27.335 --> 01:28:29.203
OWN LIFE. I TAUGHT ESL FOR MANY

01:28:29.270 --> 01:28:30.738
YEARS THAT'S ADULTS RIGHT MANY

01:28:30.805 --> 01:28:31.939
HAD LIMITED ENGLISH RIGHT BUT

01:28:32.006 --> 01:28:33.341
MANY WERE CITIZENS OR BECOMING

01:28:33.408 --> 01:28:34.375
CITIZENS AND I WOULD TEACH THEM

01:28:34.442 --> 01:28:36.244
HOW TO VOTE HOW THE PROCESS

01:28:36.310 --> 01:28:37.812
WORKS BUT I CAN'T IMAGINE.

01:28:37.879 --> 01:28:39.147
TRYING TO TEACH SOME OF THESE

01:28:39.213 --> 01:28:41.649
FOLKS WITH LIMITED ENGLISH. HOW

01:28:41.716 --> 01:28:43.818
TO VOTE. THE DIRECT CHOICE IT

01:28:43.885 --> 01:28:45.453
WOULD BE VERY A VERY COMPLEX

01:28:45.520 --> 01:28:48.356
TASK BECAUSE IT'S SO HARD. TO

01:28:48.423 --> 01:28:50.925
EXPLAIN. RANKED CHOICE VOTING

01:28:50.992 --> 01:28:53.061
DISENFRANCHISES VOTERS MANY

01:28:53.127 --> 01:28:54.662
VOTERS GIVE UP AND DON'T FINISH

01:28:54.729 --> 01:28:56.364
VOTING AND ALL AROUND BECAUSE OF

01:28:56.431 --> 01:28:57.999
VOTER FATIGUE. ONE STUDY SHOWED

01:28:58.066 --> 01:29:00.101
THAT ALMOST 30% OF VOTERS GAVE

01:29:00.168 --> 01:29:02.070
UP BEFORE COMPLETING ALL OF THE

01:29:02.136 --> 01:29:03.705
VOTING ROUNDS BECAUSE OF FATIGUE

01:29:03.771 --> 01:29:06.908
CONFUSION. IT CAN BE ARGUED THAT

01:29:06.974 --> 01:29:08.710
THIS IS DISENFRANCHISEMENT

01:29:08.776 --> 01:29:10.344
MASQUERADING AS A MORE EFFICIENT

01:29:10.411 --> 01:29:13.881
DEMOCRACY. MAKE GAMING THE VOTE

01:29:13.948 --> 01:29:15.850
THIS IS REAL. THOSE WHO FULLY

01:29:15.917 --> 01:29:17.752
UNDERSTAND RANKED CHOICE VOTING

01:29:17.819 --> 01:29:19.721
FOLLOW SPECIAL INTERESTS OFFICE

01:29:19.787 --> 01:29:21.222
CAN TURN ELECTION INTO SOMETHING

01:29:21.289 --> 01:29:23.791
AKIN TO A PREDICTIVE VIDEO GAME.

01:29:23.858 --> 01:29:25.660
WHEREIN A GROUP OF VOTERS ARE

01:29:25.727 --> 01:29:27.929
LED TO VOTE IN SPECIFIC PATTERNS

01:29:27.995 --> 01:29:29.564
SO AS TO ELIMINATE ONE CANDIDATE

01:29:29.630 --> 01:29:32.166
AND PROP UP ANOTHER THROUGH THE

01:29:32.233 --> 01:29:34.635
DIFFERENT ROUNDS OF VOTING. NEXT

01:29:34.702 --> 01:29:36.738
MAJORITY RULE. RANKED CHOICE

01:29:36.804 --> 01:29:38.439
VOTING GOES AGAINST THE CONCEPT

01:29:38.506 --> 01:29:40.808
OF ONE PERSON ONE VOTE AND

01:29:40.875 --> 01:29:42.610
MAJORITY RULE. IF A CANDIDATE

01:29:42.677 --> 01:29:43.811
ONLY ACHIEVES A MAJORITY BY

01:29:43.878 --> 01:29:46.080
ELIMINATING THOSE THAT IS NOT A

01:29:46.147 --> 01:29:48.649
REAL MAJORITY. MAJORITY RULE

01:29:48.716 --> 01:29:50.251
WITH MINORITY RIGHTS IS AN

01:29:50.318 --> 01:29:53.621
AMERICAN VALUE. TANK NEXT WILL

01:29:59.160 --> 01:30:01.162
PROBLEM AND A FIX FOR AMERICAN

DEMOCRACY IS A PEJORATIVE AND IT

01:30:03.498 --> 01:30:05.800
IS IN THE EYE OF THE BEHOLDER WE

REALLY MOVE THAT BALL FORWARD.

01:31:23.444 --> 01:31:24.946
AB TWO EIGHT AWAY GOES IN THE

01:31:25.012 --> 01:31:25.947
OPPOSITE DIRECTION AND WE

01:31:26.013 --> 01:31:28.182
RESPECTFULLY BUT STRONGLY OPPOSE

01:31:28.249 --> 01:31:29.851
IT RANKED CHOICE VOTING HAS BEEN

01:31:29.917 --> 01:31:31.619
VERY SUCCESSFULLY USED A LOCAL

01:31:31.686 --> 01:31:33.387
CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS FOR ALMOST

01:31:33.454 --> 01:31:34.822
TWENTY YEARS SO I TAKE ISSUE

01:31:34.889 --> 01:31:36.757
WITH THE IDEA THAT IT'S JUST A

01:31:36.824 --> 01:31:38.159
FAD. IT HAS A NUMBER OF

01:31:38.226 --> 01:31:39.861
ADVANTAGES WINNING CANDIDATES

01:31:39.927 --> 01:31:40.828
ARE ELECTED WITH MAJORITY

01:31:40.895 --> 01:31:43.231
SUPPORT A SINGLE ACTION WITHOUT

01:31:43.297 --> 01:31:45.166
THE NEED OR THE EXPENSE OF A RUN

01:31:45.233 --> 01:31:47.668
OFF ELIMINATES. ELIMINATES THE

01:31:47.735 --> 01:31:49.637
SPOILER EFFECT I MEAN HAVE SOME

01:31:49.704 --> 01:31:51.606
WATER- SO THE WINNER IS A BETTER

01:31:51.672 --> 01:31:53.040
REFLECTION OF VOTERS PREFERENCES

01:31:53.107 --> 01:31:54.141
AND THERE'S N NEED FOR A

01:31:54.208 --> 01:31:55.843
PRIMARY SO LOCAL ELECTIONS CAN

01:31:55.910 --> 01:31:57.245
BE HELD RIGHT ALONGSIDE THE

01:31:57.311 --> 01:31:58.646
STATEWIDE GENERAL ELECTION WILL

01:31:58.713 --> 01:32:01.782
TURN OUT ITS HIGHEST AND ALSO

01:32:01.849 --> 01:32:02.817
VERY. MUCH MORE REPRESENTATIVE.

01:32:02.884 --> 01:32:05.620
IN THE BAY AREA RCV. HAS LED TO

01:32:05.686 --> 01:32:07.722
MORE WOMEN CANDIDATES OF COLOR

01:32:07.788 --> 01:32:09.323
BEING ELECTED TO LOCAL OFFICE IN

01:32:09.390 --> 01:32:11.325
IN CITIES WITHOUT RCV. THE

01:32:11.392 --> 01:32:12.994
BILL'S FINDINGS CLAIM THAT RCV

01:32:13.060 --> 01:32:14.862
IS UNDEMOCRATIC BECAUSE

01:32:14.929 --> 01:32:16.297
CANDIDATES WITH A PLURALITY OF

01:32:16.364 --> 01:32:17.832
FIRST CHOICE VOTES MAY NOT WIN

01:32:17.899 --> 01:32:19.133
IN THE ELECTION. BUT IT'S

01:32:19.200 --> 01:32:20.735
ACTUALLY MUCH MORE DEMOCRATIC

01:32:20.801 --> 01:32:22.236
THEM PLURALITY WINNER ELECTIONS

01:32:22.303 --> 01:32:23.404
BECAUSE IT ENSURES THAT THE

01:32:23.471 --> 01:32:25.239
WINNER HAS MAJORITY SUPPORT.

01:32:25.306 --> 01:32:27.108
FINDINGS ALSO CLAIMED THAT RCB'S

01:32:27.174 --> 01:32:29.310
CONFUSING AND CAUSES VOTERS TO

01:32:29.377 --> 01:32:31.679
MAKE MISTAKES BECAUSE- BUT THIS

01:32:31.746 --> 01:32:33.147
ACTUALLY JUST RALLY ISN'T

01:32:33.214 --> 01:32:34.582
SUPPORTED BY THE DATA THAT WE'VE

01:32:34.649 --> 01:32:37.852
SEEN. RCV IS A STRAIGHTFORWARD-

01:32:37.919 --> 01:32:39.453
PROCESS VOTERS JUST INDICATE

01:32:39.520 --> 01:32:40.454
THEIR FIRST SECOND AND THIRD

01:32:40.521 --> 01:32:42.957
CHOICE AND POLLING SHOWS THAT.

01:32:43.024 --> 01:32:45.660
VOTERS UNDERSTANDING OF RCV AND

01:32:45.726 --> 01:32:47.295
THE OVER VOTE ERROR RATES ARE

01:32:47.361 --> 01:32:48.663
ACTUALLY NO DIFFERENT THAN WHAT

01:32:48.729 --> 01:32:51.866
WE SEE WITH BOTH PLURALITY IN

01:32:51.933 --> 01:32:53.868
TOP TWO. VOTING MOREOVER VOTERS

01:32:53.935 --> 01:32:55.269
HAVE INDICATED THAT THEY PREFER

01:32:55.336 --> 01:32:56.971
RCV TO THE SYSTEM IT REPLACED

01:32:57.038 --> 01:32:58.572
STRONG EVIDENCE VOTER COMFORT

01:32:58.639 --> 01:33:00.308

01:33:00.374 --> 01:33:02.276
ONLY BANS FUTURE USE OF OUR TV

01:33:02.343 --> 01:33:04.445

01:33:06.013 --> 01:33:07.815
REPRESENTING MORE THAN ONE

IN FACT I THINK IT'S A TOOL THAT

01:43:18.225 --> 01:43:19.960

URINALYSIS THE COMMITTEE'S

01:43:40.881 --> 01:43:42.950

01:43:45.252 --> 01:43:46.520

01:43:57.864 --> 01:43:59.399
COMPELLING THAT THE ELECTION

01:44:08.609 --> 01:44:10.310
THERE IS DIVERSIFICATION AND OUR

01:44:10.377 --> 01:44:12.479
ELECTED OFFICIALS PULL- I THINK

01:44:12.546 --> 01:44:13.814
THAT'S ALL PRETTY COMPELLING IN

01:44:13.880 --> 01:44:15.716

01:45:23.917 --> 01:45:24.851
THAT REQUIRES DEBATE AND

01:45:24.918 --> 01:45:26.820

01:45:34.761 --> 01:45:36.663
HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS AND HAVING

01:45:36.730 --> 01:45:38.699
THOSE QUESTIONS. BUT THERE'S ONE

01:45:38.765 --> 01:45:40.233
BENEFIT OF RANKED CHOICE VOTING

01:45:40.300 --> 01:45:41.468
THAT I THINK DOES NOT GET

01:45:41.535 --> 01:45:43.236
IDENTIFIED ENOUGH AND I THINK

01:45:43.303 --> 01:45:44.504
THEY'RE BEEN VERY MANY GOOD

01:45:44.571 --> 01:45:46.540
THINGS IDENTIFIED HERE-

01:45:46.606 --> 01:45:47.441
PARTICULARLY THE AMOUNT OF

01:45:47.507 --> 01:45:49.276
MINORITY REPRESENTATION AND SOME

01:45:49.342 --> 01:45:51.378
OF THE OTHER THINGS. THAT I

01:45:51.445 --> 01:45:54.581
HAVE. WITNESSED OVER AND OVER

01:45:54.648 --> 01:45:57.984
AGAIN- A CITY WHERE A CANDIDATE

01:45:58.051 --> 01:46:00.687
WHO HAD NO ABILITYTO GET A

01:46:00.754 --> 01:46:02.823
MAJORITY VOTE OF THE CITIZENS OF

01:46:02.889 --> 01:46:04.424
THAT CITY TO BE ON THE CITY

01:46:04.491 --> 01:46:08.495
COUNCIL. CONSISTENTLY TERM AFTER

01:46:08.562 --> 01:46:10.363
TERM WOULD WIN ELECTIONS BECAUSE

01:46:10.430 --> 01:46:13.133
A CANDIDATE HAD TWO THINGS GOING

01:46:13.200 --> 01:46:15.602
FOR IT THAT HE HAD A SMALL GROUP

01:46:15.669 --> 01:46:16.603
MINORITY GROUP OF PEOPLE THAT

01:46:16.670 --> 01:46:18.805
WERE ALWAYS GOING TO VOTE FOR.

01:46:18.872 --> 01:46:21.108
AND HE ALWAYS MADE SURE THAT

01:46:21.174 --> 01:46:22.209
THERE ARE LOTS OF CANDIDATES

01:46:22.275 --> 01:46:23.610
RUNNING HE WOULD GO OUT AND

01:46:23.677 --> 01:46:24.344
ENCOURAGE EVERYBODY TO RUN

01:46:24.411 --> 01:46:26.279
BECAUSE THE MORE PEOPLE THAT

01:46:26.346 --> 01:46:27.748
RAN. THE MORE HE WAS ASSURED

01:46:27.814 --> 01:46:30.517
THAT HIS 28% OF THE VOTERS WAS

01:46:30.584 --> 01:46:32.519
GOING TO GUARANTEE HIM A SEAT

01:46:32.586 --> 01:46:35.922
AND SO I THINK DEMOCRACY IS NOT

01:46:35.989 --> 01:46:37.958
SWELL SERVED WHEN YOU HAVE.

01:46:38.024 --> 01:46:39.192
REPRESENTATIVES ON THE CITY

01:46:39.259 --> 01:46:40.727
COUNCIL THAT ARE CONSISTENTLY

01:46:40.794 --> 01:46:43.230
VOTED AND THEY DO NOT HAVE A

01:46:43.296 --> 01:46:46.333
MAJORITY VOTE. THEY DO NOT HAVE

01:46:46.399 --> 01:46:48.368
THE ABILITY TO EVER GET A

01:46:48.435 --> 01:46:50.904
MAJORITY VOTE. AND THAT IS TO ME

01:46:50.971 --> 01:46:52.372
THE GREAT BENEFIT OF RANKED

01:46:52.439 --> 01:46:54.608
CHOICE VOTING HIS THAT YOU AT

01:46:54.674 --> 01:46:57.177
LEAST GET SOMEONE WHO IF IT WAS

01:46:57.244 --> 01:46:59.479
DOWN TO TWO PEOPLE. THIS PERSON

01:46:59.546 --> 01:47:01.381
WOULD NEVER HAVE WON A TWO

01:47:01.448 --> 01:47:04.050
PERSON RACE. I THINK IT IN THE

01:47:04.117 --> 01:47:05.552
IN THE CITY THAT I'M TALKING

01:47:05.619 --> 01:47:08.155
ABOUT AND SO- WITH THAT- I

01:47:08.221 --> 01:47:10.056
CERTAINLY AND MOST. OF IT IS

01:47:10.123 --> 01:47:11.958
JUST TIME REMAIN A SUPPORTER OF

01:47:12.025 --> 01:47:14.027

01:47:53.066 --> 01:47:55.468
CHARTER CITIES ARE ARE AT A LOT

01:47:55.535 --> 01:47:56.570
OF PEOPLE DON'T KNOW AND

DEMOCRACY. IT HAS A DUTY TO

01:48:38.578 --> 01:48:40.447

01:51:11.498 --> 01:51:14.367
FACT- DISENFRANCHISES VOTERS

01:51:14.434 --> 01:51:15.769
VOTERS END UP OFTENTIMES GIVING

01:51:15.835 --> 01:51:18.038

SHOULD BE A COUNCILMAN. OKAY I

01:51:37.223 --> 01:51:38.858
DON'T THINK WE SHOULD CREATE A

01:51:38.925 --> 01:51:39.793
MECHANISM- WHEN SOMEONE COULD

01:51:39.859 --> 01:51:41.294
BECOME A ACCOUNTS MEMBER WITHOUT

01:51:41.361 --> 01:51:43.029

01:53:23.830 --> 01:53:25.999
ENSURING THAT OUR DEMOCRACY IS

01:53:26.065 --> 01:53:27.567
FUNCTIONAL- AND HAS A HIGH

01:53:27.634 --> 01:53:28.468
EFFICACY AS HIGH THE NEXT IF

THIS IS POSSIBLE USE RANKED

01:53:29.903 --> 01:53:31.671
CHOICE VOTING I WAS ALREADY

01:53:31.738 --> 01:53:33.973
LIMITED. ONLY TO CHARTER CITIES.

01:53:34.040 --> 01:53:35.074
BUT DISTINCT MEANS THEY'RE ALSO

01:53:35.141 --> 01:53:36.442
ADDITIONAL TWO CHARTER CITIES

01:53:36.509 --> 01:53:37.477

ELECTIONS AND SO I SEE AN

01:53:42.248 --> 01:53:43.449
INHERENT CONTRADICTION. IN

01:53:43.516 --> 01:53:44.984

DEMOCRACY THAT'S ALREADY TAKING

01:53:47.554 --> 01:53:49.522

THERE'S EVIDENCE THAT THEY'VE

01:56:37.457 --> 01:56:40.326
MOVED ADDRESSES. IF THAT HAPPENS

01:56:40.393 --> 01:56:42.095
I NOTICE GOES OUT FOR YEARS

01:56:42.161 --> 01:56:43.763
BEFORE THE ACTUAL CANCELLATION

01:56:43.830 --> 01:56:45.732
RIGHT FOUR YEARS TO LET FOLKS

FOUR YEARS. BUT THERE'S NO

01:56:53.373 --> 01:56:55.074
REQUIREMENT TO LET VOTERS KNOW

01:56:55.141 --> 01:56:56.142
THAT THEIR REGISTRATIONS

01:56:56.209 --> 01:56:57.910
ACTUALLY BEING CANCELED FOR THAT

01:56:57.977 --> 01:56:59.879
ADDRESS CHANGE PROCESS. AND

01:56:59.946 --> 01:57:01.881

AT ALL SO AB TWO EIGHT FOUR ONE

01:57:12.692 --> 01:57:13.192

ARE- COMING UP. SO STUDIES

01:57:20.833 --> 01:57:21.834
INDICATE THAT MULTIPLE

01:57:21.901 --> 01:57:22.902
COMMUNICATIONS PLUS AN

01:57:22.969 --> 01:57:24.704
OPPORTUNITY TO CURE THE PROBLEM

01:57:24.771 --> 01:57:27.039
CAN BE ONE OF THE MOST EFFECTIVE

01:57:27.106 --> 01:57:27.407
WAYS TO PREVENT

01:57:27.473 --> 01:57:30.743
DISENFRANCHISEMENT. AB TWO EIGHT

01:57:30.810 --> 01:57:32.311

01:57:33.679 --> 01:57:36.149
PROVIDES THEM THIS OPPORTUNITY

01:57:36.215 --> 01:57:37.984

01:57:59.605 --> 01:58:00.907
SEVENTEEN PERCENT. THE

CONSERVATORSHIP FOR MANY REASONS

01:58:15.555 --> 01:58:17.089
AND BY LAW THEY RETAIN THEIR

01:58:17.156 --> 01:58:18.224
VOTING RIGHTS UNLESS THE COURT

01:58:18.291 --> 01:58:19.759

REGULAR AND UNCLEAR MANNER. THIS

01:58:40.379 --> 01:58:41.714
MAY BE BECAUSE ABOUT HALF OF
