00:34:32.537 --> 00:34:35.173
THE STATE. THE NEED IS AND IS

00:34:35.239 --> 00:34:37.275
THERE FOR EVERY FURTHER ACROSS

00:34:37.341 --> 00:34:38.376
THE STATE STATE SO I DON'T

00:34:38.443 --> 00:34:40.645
THINK. OF FROM OUR RESEARCH IS

00:34:40.711 --> 00:34:42.513
THAT IT'S UNDERSERVED ALL ACROSS

00:34:42.580 --> 00:34:44.615
THE STATE AND NOT. WE HAVEN'T

00:34:44.682 --> 00:34:46.117
SEEN IN THE AREA IF YOU KNOW OF

00:34:46.184 --> 00:34:48.619
THEM LET US KNOW WE CAN MAYBE.

00:34:48.686 --> 00:34:50.488
OF AMEND THE BILL TO SPECIFIC

00:34:50.555 --> 00:34:52.723
SAID NOT IN THAT AREA- WELL I

00:34:52.790 --> 00:34:54.959
THINK I THINK LIKE WITH ANY KIND

00:34:55.026 --> 00:34:56.761
OF MEDICAL SERVICE THERE ARE

00:34:56.828 --> 00:34:58.963
CERTAIN AREAS THAT HAVE- MORE

00:34:59.030 --> 00:35:00.865
PROVIDERS WHETHER IT'S MEDICAL

00:35:00.932 --> 00:35:02.600

00:35:02.667 --> 00:35:03.801
HEALTH PROVIDERS IN WHICH YOU

00:35:03.868 --> 00:35:05.570
FIND IN SOME OTHER AREAS AND SO

00:35:05.636 --> 00:35:07.872
I THINK WITH. THIS FUND THIS

00:35:07.939 --> 00:35:09.574
ORIGINAL FUN IT'S REALLY. TRYING

00:35:09.640 --> 00:35:12.844
TO FOCUS ON PROVIDING MORE- THAN

00:35:12.910 --> 00:35:14.645
TO HEALTH PROVIDERS IN

00:35:14.712 --> 00:35:16.514
UNDERSERVED AREAS. I THOUGHT

00:35:16.581 --> 00:35:19.484
ABOUT MAYBE ADDING THAT INTO THE

00:35:19.550 --> 00:35:21.686
BILL SINCE THAT IS A- KEY

00:35:21.752 --> 00:35:23.488
COMPONENT OF THE OPPOSITION I'M

00:35:23.554 --> 00:35:26.157
- WELL FIRST I DO AGREE WITH YOU

00:35:26.224 --> 00:35:27.525
WHEN IT COMES TO MEDICAL

00:35:27.592 --> 00:35:29.694
SERVICES WE IN THIS BODY HAS

00:35:29.760 --> 00:35:30.495
ALWAYS TARGET AREAS THAT

00:35:30.561 --> 00:35:33.865
UNDERSERVED. EIGHT MEDICAL UN

00:35:33.931 --> 00:35:35.867
DOES IS SEEKING MEDICAL HELP

00:35:35.933 --> 00:35:37.768
ESPECIALLY RURAL AREAS AS A MUCH

00:35:37.835 --> 00:35:39.370
MUCH HARDER DIFFICULT TIME THAN

00:35:39.437 --> 00:35:41.172
THOSE OF US SAY AN ORANGE COUNTY

00:35:41.239 --> 00:35:43.441

00:35:43.508 --> 00:35:45.276
EIGHT. SO I COMPLETELY

00:35:45.343 --> 00:35:47.578
UNDERSTAND THAT. OUR PURPOSE OF

00:35:47.645 --> 00:35:49.981
THE BILL HAS BEEN IS TO LOOK AT

00:35:50.047 --> 00:35:52.283

SPECIFIC LANGUAGE TO NARROW IT

00:36:00.825 --> 00:36:02.260
DOWN TO MAKE SURE THAT IT

00:36:02.326 --> 00:36:04.529
DOESN'T GO INTO AREAS THAT HAS

00:36:04.595 --> 00:36:06.197

PROBABLY ALL AWARE OF. SOME OF

01:11:34.089 --> 01:11:36.525
THE- AND INTENDED CONSEQUENCES

01:11:36.592 --> 01:11:38.394
OF YOU KNOW THE LEGALIZATION OF

GROWING ILLEGAL MARIJUANA. I'M I

01:11:45.701 --> 01:11:47.503

YOUR BILL- IS. THAT YOU GO DOWN

01:11:51.774 --> 01:11:53.075

01:11:53.142 --> 01:11:55.210
THAT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE SOMEONE

01:11:55.277 --> 01:11:57.680
WHO IS. WE ARE TRYING TO GO

01:11:57.746 --> 01:11:59.615
AFTER WHO YOU SHOULD BE TRYING

01:11:59.682 --> 01:12:01.083
TO GO AFTER THEY'RE NOT A BIG

01:12:01.150 --> 01:12:02.918
PLAYER IF YOU HAVE SOMEONE WHO

01:12:02.985 --> 01:12:06.722
ONLY HAS SIX PLANTS. AND SO TO-

01:12:06.789 --> 01:12:09.191
START INCREASING THEIR FINES-

01:12:09.258 --> 01:12:10.359
FOR SOMEONE WHO'S PROBABLY LIKE

01:12:10.426 --> 01:12:13.128
LOW INCOME VERY SMALL PLAYER IN

01:12:13.195 --> 01:12:15.597
THIS GAME IS. IS A LITTLE BIT

01:12:15.664 --> 01:12:17.533
CONCERNING FOR ME SO IS THERE

01:12:17.599 --> 01:12:19.268
ANY PARTICULAR REASON WHY YOU

01:12:19.334 --> 01:12:21.236
WENT SOLO. IN ORDER FOR

01:12:21.303 --> 01:12:25.507
TOMORROW. LIKE AB TWENTY SEVEN

01:12:25.574 --> 01:12:27.242
TWENTY EIGHT IS BASED ON THE

01:12:27.309 --> 01:12:28.243
COUNTIES FEE STRUCTURE WHICH WAS

01:12:28.310 --> 01:12:29.778
ENACTED AN ORDINANCE LAST AUGUST

01:12:29.845 --> 01:12:32.081
IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE- I THINK

01:12:32.147 --> 01:12:34.049
THAT I AGREE WITH YOU I THINK

01:12:34.116 --> 01:12:35.617
THAT THE PURPOSE OF THIS BILL IS

01:12:35.684 --> 01:12:37.352
TO GO AFTER THE BIG FISH NOT THE

01:12:37.419 --> 01:12:39.521
LITTLE GUY- AND I THINK THAT

01:12:39.588 --> 01:12:40.689
THAT'S AN OPEN CONVERSATION

01:12:40.756 --> 01:12:42.257
MOVING FORWARD AND I'LL DEFER TO

01:12:42.324 --> 01:12:43.992
THE AUTHOR OF COURSE BUT- I

01:12:44.059 --> 01:12:45.394
THINK THAT'S PART OF A SOMETHING

01:12:45.461 --> 01:12:47.596
WE COULD REDUCE. THE REASON TO

01:12:47.663 --> 01:12:49.164
GO TO SIX WELL PLANTS IZLE

01:12:49.231 --> 01:12:51.166
CURRENT LAW SAYS YOU CAN HAVE

01:12:51.233 --> 01:12:52.434
SIX INDIVIDUALS WE HAVE TO WORK

01:12:52.501 --> 01:12:54.203
THAT WAY BEFORE BUT I'M NOT

01:12:54.269 --> 01:12:56.171
AFTER. I'M I'M SORRY CAN YOU SAY

01:12:56.238 --> 01:12:58.173
THAT AGAIN IT. THE CURRENT LAW

01:12:58.240 --> 01:13:00.209
SAYS YOU HAVE TO HAVE UP TO SIX

01:13:00.275 --> 01:13:02.377
PLANTS IS CURRENT LAW THAT'S WHY

01:13:02.444 --> 01:13:04.246
WE HAVE TO HAVE THAT LANGUAGE IN

01:13:04.313 --> 01:13:05.748
THE BILL GOING FORWARD WE'RE NOT

01:13:05.814 --> 01:13:07.816
AFTER THE LITTLE ONES IN THE I

01:13:07.883 --> 01:13:09.818
DON'T THINK ANY DA IN THE STATE.

01:13:09.885 --> 01:13:11.553
WOULD HAVE BEEN ONE OF THE ONES

01:13:11.620 --> 01:13:12.421
THAT HAVE HUNDREDS THOUSANDS OF

01:13:12.488 --> 01:13:13.655
PLANTS. RIGHT I GUESS MY CONCERN

01:13:13.722 --> 01:13:15.824
IS WHEN YOU ACTUALLY PUT IT IN

01:13:15.891 --> 01:13:17.025
HERE. THEN THE OPPORTUNITY IS

01:13:17.092 --> 01:13:18.861
AVAILABLE TO GO AFTER SOMEONE.

01:13:18.927 --> 01:13:20.529
WITH ONLY SIX OR SEVEN PLAN BUT

01:13:20.596 --> 01:13:22.598
I THINK WITH THE LEADS COUNCILS

01:13:22.664 --> 01:13:23.999
LANGUAGE IT HAD TO BE PUT IN

01:13:24.066 --> 01:13:26.235

ALLIANCE COALITION. JENNIFER

01:41:35.556 --> 01:41:38.125
TANNAHILL ON BEHALF OF THE

01:41:38.192 --> 01:41:39.193
CALIFORNIA DENTAL HYGIENISTS

01:41:39.259 --> 01:41:48.802
ASSOCIATION.

01:41:48.869 --> 01:41:50.404
GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS MELODY

01:41:50.471 --> 01:41:51.872
RANDOLPH. AND I'M HERE

01:41:51.939 --> 01:41:53.740
REPRESENTING OVER SEVENTY

01:41:53.807 --> 01:41:54.775
THOUSAND DENTAL ASSISTANTS AND

01:41:54.842 --> 01:41:56.910
DENTAL ASSISTING EDUCATORS. WE

01:41:56.977 --> 01:41:58.579
HAVE MANY CONCERNS WITH THIS

01:41:58.645 --> 01:42:00.314
CHANGED OUR SCOPE OF PRACTICE.

01:42:00.380 --> 01:42:02.316
ALL ADDRESS JUST A FEW HERE.

01:42:02.382 --> 01:42:04.384
NUMBER ONE THESE ARE NOT BASIC

01:42:04.451 --> 01:42:07.454
SUPPORTIVE DUTIES AS DEFINED. OF

01:42:07.521 --> 01:42:11.024
THE UNLICENSED DA. IN BE IN P.

01:42:11.091 --> 01:42:12.292
SEVENTEEN FORTY CURRENT POLICY

01:42:12.359 --> 01:42:14.027
REQUIRES THE USE OF A HANDPIECE.

01:42:14.094 --> 01:42:15.629
THIS DRUG CAUSES FRICTION AND

01:42:15.696 --> 01:42:17.064
HEAT AND CAN POTENTIALLY KILL

01:42:17.130 --> 01:42:18.565
THE NERVE OF THE TOOTH AND

01:42:18.632 --> 01:42:20.234
DAMAGE SOFT TISSUE. THE

01:42:20.300 --> 01:42:21.635
PHOSPHORIC ACID USED DURING

01:42:21.702 --> 01:42:23.504
SEALANT PLACEMENT DAMAGES THE

01:42:23.570 --> 01:42:25.739
OUTER LAYER OF THE ENAMEL IN

01:42:25.806 --> 01:42:27.808
ORDER FOR THE SEALANT TO STICK.

01:42:27.875 --> 01:42:29.843
IF IT TOUCHES SOFT TISSUE IT'LL

01:42:29.910 --> 01:42:32.613
BURN IT WITHIN SECONDS. DOES

01:42:32.679 --> 01:42:34.581
THIS SOUND BASIC AND SUPPORTIVE.

01:42:34.648 --> 01:42:36.617
LACK OF FUNCTIONAL. FOUNDATIONAL

01:42:36.683 --> 01:42:38.418
EDUCATION AND TRAINING IS OUR

01:42:38.485 --> 01:42:40.487
NUMBER TWO. THIS CHANGED HER

01:42:40.554 --> 01:42:41.388
SCOPE OF PRACTICE WOULD ALLOW

01:42:41.455 --> 01:42:43.357
SOMEONE TO PERFORM THESE DUTIES

01:42:43.423 --> 01:42:44.691
WITHIN WEEKS OF THE FIRST DAY IN

01:42:44.758 --> 01:42:47.160
DENTISTRY. THE TWO DAY COURSE

01:42:47.227 --> 01:42:48.595
REFERENCED EARLIER ON THE

01:42:48.662 --> 01:42:50.297
CERTIFICATION COURSES IT'S JUST

01:42:50.364 --> 01:42:52.232
A TWO DAY COURSE. IN THESE

01:42:52.299 --> 01:42:53.467
PROCEDURES WERE WRITTEN WITH THE

01:42:53.534 --> 01:42:54.835
UNDERSTANDING THAT PEOPLE TAKING

01:42:54.902 --> 01:42:57.471
THEM WILL ALREADY HAVE. A YEAR'S

01:42:57.538 --> 01:42:59.072
WORTH OF EDUCATION TRAINING AND

01:42:59.139 --> 01:43:01.375
EXPERIENCE WE CAN'T POSSIBLY

01:43:01.441 --> 01:43:02.976
COVER THE FOUNDATIONAL KNOWLEDGE

01:43:03.043 --> 01:43:04.478
AN ASSISTANT NEEDS PRIOR TO

01:43:04.545 --> 01:43:06.113
PERFORMING THESE DUTIES. IN

01:43:06.179 --> 01:43:10.050
THESE SHORT COURSES. AB TWENTY

01:43:10.117 --> 01:43:10.951
ONE NINETY SIX INCREASES THE

01:43:11.018 --> 01:43:12.686
INSTRUCTIONAL HOURS TO CUT HAIR

01:43:12.753 --> 01:43:14.988
FROM A THOUSAND HOURS TO TWELVE

01:43:15.055 --> 01:43:16.757
HUNDRED HOURS. BUT A DA CAN

01:43:16.823 --> 01:43:18.392
PLACE PHOSPHORIC ACID ON A

01:43:18.458 --> 01:43:20.827
TOOTH. AND AFTER SIXTEEN HOURS

01:43:20.894 --> 01:43:25.232
OF EDUCATION. THAT SOUNDS CRAZY

01:43:25.299 --> 01:43:27.067
. DENNIS SUPERB. CONTRARY TO

01:43:27.134 --> 01:43:28.502
WHAT THE BILL'S SPONSOR WOULD

01:43:28.569 --> 01:43:30.037
LEAD YOU TO BELIEVE THE DENTIST

01:43:30.103 --> 01:43:31.438
RARELY SUPERVISORS DURING THESE

01:43:31.505 --> 01:43:34.341
PROCEDURES. AND LASTLY THIS BILL

01:43:34.408 --> 01:43:35.576
DOES NOT ADDRESS THE STAFFING

01:43:35.642 --> 01:43:37.811
SHORTAGE IN FACT WE BELIEVE THAT

01:43:37.878 --> 01:43:39.846
MOVING THESE DUTIES FROM THE RTA

01:43:39.913 --> 01:43:41.682
TO THE DA WILL MAKE THE SHORTAGE

01:43:41.748 --> 01:43:43.050
WORSE. AS WE HAVE HEARD FROM

01:43:43.116 --> 01:43:45.085
NUMEROUS MEMBERS OF OUR

01:43:45.152 --> 01:43:47.554
ORGANIZATIONS THAT TRAINED AND

01:43:47.621 --> 01:43:49.656
SEASONED RDAS. WILL LEAVE

01:43:49.723 --> 01:43:51.892
DENTISTRY VIEWING THIS AS A HUGE

01:43:51.959 --> 01:43:53.493
STEP IN THE DESTRUCTION OF THEIR

01:43:53.560 --> 01:43:55.596
CAREER. PLEASE CONSIDER THE LONG

01:43:55.662 --> 01:43:56.997
TERM CONSEQUENCES TO THIS

01:43:57.064 --> 01:43:58.165
DRASTIC CHANGE IN THE DENTAL

01:43:58.231 --> 01:44:00.167
ASSISTING SCOPE OF PRACTICE WE

01:44:00.233 --> 01:44:01.835
RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR NO

01:44:01.902 --> 01:44:04.304

CHAIRMAN MEMBERS JENNIFER TANAH

01:44:09.977 --> 01:44:11.478
HELL WITH AARON REED AND

01:44:11.545 --> 01:44:12.379
ASSOCIATES ON BEHALF OF THE

01:44:12.446 --> 01:44:13.947
CALIFORNIA DENTAL HYGIENISTS

01:44:14.014 --> 01:44:16.650
ASSOCIATION. CITY HA ECHOES THE

01:44:16.717 --> 01:44:18.085
DENTAL ASSISTING ALLIANCES

01:44:18.151 --> 01:44:19.886
CONCERNS FOR PATIENT SAFETY WITH

01:44:19.953 --> 01:44:21.622
THIS BILLS LACK OF FOUNDATIONAL

01:44:21.688 --> 01:44:23.390
EDUCATION BEFORE USING

01:44:23.457 --> 01:44:25.692
PHOSPHORIC ACID ETCH AND

01:44:25.759 --> 01:44:27.327
MOTORIZED HAND TOOLS INSIDE A

01:44:27.394 --> 01:44:29.429
CHILD'S MOUTH. WITH POTENTIALLY

01:44:29.496 --> 01:44:30.397
JUST A COUPLE OF WEEKS ON THE

01:44:30.464 --> 01:44:33.667
JOB LET'S BE CLEAR ABOUT WHAT

01:44:33.734 --> 01:44:34.501
WE'RE DISCUSSING. THERE ARE TWO

01:44:34.568 --> 01:44:36.670
TYPES OF DENTAL ASSISTANTS ONE

01:44:36.737 --> 01:44:38.705
THE UNLICENSED DENTAL ASSISTANT

01:44:38.772 --> 01:44:40.841
AND TO THE LICENSED REGISTERED

01:44:40.907 --> 01:44:44.011
DENTAL ASSISTANT. OR RDA. THE

01:44:44.077 --> 01:44:45.679
UNLICENSED DENTAL ASSISTANT IS

01:44:45.746 --> 01:44:47.347
ON THE JOB TRAINED NO BACKGROUND

01:44:47.414 --> 01:44:49.016
CHECK IN IS GENERALLY PAID

01:44:49.082 --> 01:44:51.752
MINIMUM WAGE. A LICENSED RDA HAS

01:44:51.818 --> 01:44:53.453
TWO PATHS TO ENTRY WHICH ARE

01:44:53.520 --> 01:44:56.289
EITHER OF FIFTEEN MONTHS ON THE

01:44:56.356 --> 01:44:57.424
JOB TRAINING CERTIFIED BY A

01:44:57.491 --> 01:45:00.193
DENTIST. OR COMPLETION OF A

01:45:00.260 --> 01:45:01.361
BOARD APPROVED EDUCATIONAL

01:45:01.428 --> 01:45:03.997
PROGRAM THE LICENSED RTA EARNS

01:45:04.064 --> 01:45:05.666
MORE THAN MINIMUM WAGE UP TO

01:45:05.732 --> 01:45:06.967
ABOUT TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS AN

01:45:07.034 --> 01:45:08.402
HOUR IN THE BAY AREA USUALLY

01:45:08.468 --> 01:45:10.070
WITH BENEFITS WHICH IS A

01:45:10.137 --> 01:45:11.304
SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE FROM THE

01:45:11.371 --> 01:45:13.974
MINIMUM WAGE UNLICENSED DENTAL

01:45:14.041 --> 01:45:15.876
ASSISTANT POSITION. THIS BILL

01:45:15.942 --> 01:45:17.377
DOES NOT FIX A BARRIER TO ENTRY

01:45:17.444 --> 01:45:19.279
PROBLEM BECAUSE THERE ALREADY

01:45:19.346 --> 01:45:21.348
EXISTS AN ON THE JOB TRAINING

01:45:21.415 --> 01:45:24.818
OPTION TO BECOME A LICENSED RDA

01:45:24.885 --> 01:45:27.120
THE BARRIER TO ENTRY IS VERY LOW

01:45:27.187 --> 01:45:29.156
. IT IS AN EXCELLENT ENTRY POINT

01:45:29.222 --> 01:45:30.691
INTO THE ORAL HEALTH CARE FIELD

01:45:30.757 --> 01:45:32.826
STAFFING SHORTAGES THAT EXIST

01:45:32.893 --> 01:45:34.194
CAN BE ADDRESSED THROUGH

01:45:34.261 --> 01:45:36.363
INCREASED PAY AND BENEFITS. WE

01:45:36.430 --> 01:45:37.531
ARE CONCERNED THAT THE CAREER

01:45:37.597 --> 01:45:39.499
LADDER FOR LICENSED RDAS WILL

01:45:39.566 --> 01:45:41.501
COLLAPSE AS A DENT AS DENTAL

01:45:41.568 --> 01:45:43.670
OFFICES WILL BE INCENTIVIZED TO

01:45:43.737 --> 01:45:45.238
INSTEAD HIRE A PERSON WITH NO

01:45:45.305 --> 01:45:47.007
EXPERIENCE AND INADEQUATE

01:45:47.074 --> 01:45:49.076
TRAINING TO DO THESE PROCEDURES

01:45:49.142 --> 01:45:50.277
FOR MINIMUM WAGE WITHOUT

01:45:50.343 --> 01:45:52.412
BENEFITS. THEREBY MAKING THE

01:45:52.479 --> 01:45:55.982
LICENSED RDA CATEGORY EVAPORATE

01:45:56.049 --> 01:45:57.284
. BECAUSE CORONA POLISHING

01:45:57.350 --> 01:45:59.219
SEALANTS ARE THE MAIN PROCEDURES

01:45:59.286 --> 01:46:01.488
PERFORMED BY LICENSED RDAS. THIS

01:46:01.555 --> 01:46:03.423
BILL INCENTIVIZES DENTAL OFFICES

01:46:03.490 --> 01:46:04.658
TO FIRE THE LICENSE RDAS AND

01:46:04.725 --> 01:46:06.493
REPLACE THEM WITH MINIMUM WAGE

01:46:06.560 --> 01:46:09.162
AND LYFT AND SIMPLY. PORTABILITY

01:46:09.229 --> 01:46:11.364
IS ANOTHER ISSUE MEANING A

01:46:11.431 --> 01:46:13.133
LICENSED RDA CAN COMMAND A GOOD

01:46:13.200 --> 01:46:14.768
WAGE IF SHE MOVED TO ANOTHER

01:46:14.835 --> 01:46:16.536
CITY OR OUT OF STATE WITH HER

01:46:16.603 --> 01:46:17.838
LICENSE IT'S MORE DIFFICULT FOR

01:46:17.904 --> 01:46:19.606
AN UNLICENSED DENTAL ASSISTANT

01:46:19.673 --> 01:46:21.241
SAID VANCE THROUGH THE CAREER

01:46:21.308 --> 01:46:24.211
LADDER TO INCREASE PAY AND-

01:46:24.277 --> 01:46:26.413
BENEFIT OPPORTUNITIES. NOTABLY

01:46:26.480 --> 01:46:28.181
THERE IS NOT CONSENSUS AMONG

01:46:28.248 --> 01:46:30.150

PROCEDURES TO UNLICENSED STAFF.

HOWEVER WITH THE LATE NOTICE

01:46:35.622 --> 01:46:37.023
THAT A REMOTE TELECONFERENCE

01:46:37.090 --> 01:46:38.391

01:48:56.963 --> 01:48:58.098
CORONA POLISHING AND THE

01:48:58.164 --> 01:49:00.066
SEALANT. SO THEY WOULD NOT- BE

01:49:00.133 --> 01:49:01.735
ABLE TO START PRACTICING WITHIN

01:49:01.801 --> 01:49:03.536
WEEKS OF BEING HIRED THEY WOULD

01:49:03.603 --> 01:49:05.305
HAVE TO COMPLETE ALL THE

01:49:05.372 --> 01:49:05.805
NECESSARY TRAINING AND

01:49:05.872 --> 01:49:06.840
CERTIFICATIONS AND THEN

01:49:06.907 --> 01:49:08.275
ADDITIONALLY GET CERTIFIED FOR

01:49:08.341 --> 01:49:10.443
THESE TWO- DUTIES BEFORE THEY

01:49:10.510 --> 01:49:11.745
CAN BEGIN PRACTICING AND HOW

01:49:11.811 --> 01:49:13.680
MUCH IS THAT TIME. THE TRAINING

01:49:13.747 --> 01:49:15.215
THAT THEY GO THROUGH. I'M I AM

01:49:15.282 --> 01:49:17.217
NOT SURE THE HOURS OFF THE TOP

01:49:17.284 --> 01:49:19.152
OF MY HEAD BUT IT IS IT HAS TO

01:49:19.219 --> 01:49:21.221
BE DONE WITHIN THEIR FIRST YEAR

01:49:21.288 --> 01:49:22.822
OF BEING. HIRED YOU CAN DO THE

01:49:22.889 --> 01:49:26.393
TWO HOURS OF THAT- IS IT ALREADY

01:49:26.459 --> 01:49:28.862
A AND THEN THE EIGHT HOURS OF

01:49:28.929 --> 01:49:29.863
INFECTION CONTROL THAT'S WHAT

01:49:29.930 --> 01:49:31.998
YOU'RE REFERRING TO OKAY. I'M SO

01:49:32.065 --> 01:49:35.168
THAT'S A TOTAL OF TEN HOURS- AND

01:49:35.235 --> 01:49:37.170
I'M SORRY. YOU WERE GOING TO

01:49:37.237 --> 01:49:39.239
THANK I WAS JUST GONNA SAY I CAN

01:49:39.306 --> 01:49:40.607
ADDRESS THAT YEAH THE INFECTION

01:49:40.674 --> 01:49:41.808
CONTROL IS EIGHT HOURS. THE

01:49:41.875 --> 01:49:42.709
DENTAL PRACTICE ACT IS TWO

01:49:42.776 --> 01:49:50.016
HOURS. THE CROWN OF POLISH IS.

01:49:50.083 --> 01:49:51.851
TWELVE OKAY SO AGAIN WITH IN A

01:49:51.918 --> 01:49:54.654
WEEK OR TWO THEY COULD. BE DOING

01:49:54.721 --> 01:49:58.158
THESE PROCEDURES OKAY. I'M WHAT.

01:49:58.224 --> 01:49:59.693
WHAT ARE THERE ANY RISK

01:49:59.759 --> 01:50:04.397
ASSOCIATED WITH THE- POLISHING

01:50:04.464 --> 01:50:08.935
THERE ANY COMPLICATIONS. IN

01:50:09.002 --> 01:50:10.537
THEORY THERE'S COMPLICATIONS

01:50:10.603 --> 01:50:12.706
THERE COULD BE COMPLICATIONS-

01:50:12.772 --> 01:50:15.141
BUT SOME OF THE OTHER- TASKS

01:50:15.208 --> 01:50:17.377
THAT DA'S CAN DO THERE'S ALSO

01:50:17.444 --> 01:50:18.611
THAT SAME RISK IF SOMEONE IS

01:50:18.678 --> 01:50:20.513
CARELESS AND THIS IS WHY WE DO

01:50:20.580 --> 01:50:22.182
ON THE JOB TRAINING WE MAKE SURE

01:50:22.248 --> 01:50:23.883
THAT THE QUALITY AND THE SAFETY

01:50:23.950 --> 01:50:26.119
IS THERE WHEN OUR ASSISTANTS ARE

01:50:26.186 --> 01:50:29.689
PERFORMING THESE DUTIES OF THE

01:50:29.756 --> 01:50:32.225
V. I'VE NEVER ACTUALLY SEEN.

01:50:32.292 --> 01:50:34.027
SOMEONE HAVE DAMAGE FROM CORONA

01:50:34.094 --> 01:50:37.230
POLISHING THAT'S- IT'S A IT'S A

01:50:37.297 --> 01:50:40.100
MINIMALLY INVASIVE- YOU REMOVE A

01:50:40.166 --> 01:50:42.302
VERY SMALL AMOUNT OF TO

01:50:42.369 --> 01:50:43.770
STRUCTURE AND IT'S REALLY THE

01:50:43.837 --> 01:50:47.173
BIO PHONE THAT YOU'RE REMOVING-

01:50:47.240 --> 01:50:49.376
IT'S REALLY CONSIDERED

01:50:49.442 --> 01:50:51.177
COMPLETELY REVERSIBLE. SO WHAT

01:50:51.244 --> 01:50:53.413
WOULD BE SOME OF THE SOME OF THE

01:50:53.480 --> 01:50:56.649
COMPLICATIONS. IF YOU HAD-

01:50:56.716 --> 01:50:58.485
PRESSURE APPLIED TO THE TOOTH

01:50:58.551 --> 01:50:59.986
FOR AN EXTRAORDINARY AMOUNT OF

01:51:00.053 --> 01:51:01.788
TIME YOU COULD OVER HEAT THE

01:51:01.855 --> 01:51:03.390
TOOTH BUT NO ONE'S NO ONE'S

01:51:03.456 --> 01:51:04.891
POLISHING THAT WAY YOU KNOW

01:51:04.958 --> 01:51:06.092
EVERYBODY'S ON A TIME SCHEDULE

01:51:06.159 --> 01:51:07.927
NO ONE'S GOING TO HOLD. AN

01:51:07.994 --> 01:51:09.796
INSTRUMENT ON A TOOTH FOR TWO

01:51:09.863 --> 01:51:11.464
MINUTES TO COOK THE POP THAT IS

01:51:11.531 --> 01:51:14.367
NOT WHAT HAPPENS ALSO THERE IS A

01:51:14.434 --> 01:51:16.836
SPECIFIED TIME. THERE'S MORE IS

01:51:16.903 --> 01:51:18.671
. SO IS THERE A SPECIFIED TIME.

01:51:18.738 --> 01:51:20.340
THERE'S NOT A SPECIFIED TIME BUT

01:51:20.407 --> 01:51:22.375
IN PERFORMING THAT DUTY YOU

01:51:22.442 --> 01:51:24.110
REALLY YOU CLEAN THE SURFACE OF

01:51:24.177 --> 01:51:25.345
THE TOOTH YOU'RE CONSTANTLY

01:51:25.412 --> 01:51:27.080
MOVING IN YOUR MOVING IN GENTLE

01:51:27.147 --> 01:51:28.815
CIRCLES AND YOU'RE MOVING.

01:51:28.882 --> 01:51:30.483
RATHER QUICKLY IF ANYONE HAS

01:51:30.550 --> 01:51:31.518
EVER HAD A DENTAL CLEANING YOU

01:51:31.584 --> 01:51:33.386
KNOW. THEY'RE NOT SITTING THERE

01:51:33.453 --> 01:51:35.655
IN ONE SPOT FOR TWO MINUTES OR

01:51:35.722 --> 01:51:36.556
OR FOR A PROLONGED AMOUNT OF

01:51:36.623 --> 01:51:38.324
TIME WHERE YOU'RE GOING TO DO

01:51:38.391 --> 01:51:39.392
DAMAGE. OKAY AND SO YOU'RE

01:51:39.459 --> 01:51:40.427
SAYING THAT THERE COULD BE

01:51:40.493 --> 01:51:42.062
THERMAL DAMAGE WHICH WOULD LEAD

01:51:42.128 --> 01:51:45.165
TO NERVE DAMAGE. IN THEORY I'VE

01:51:45.231 --> 01:51:49.369
NEVER SEEN THAT HAPPEN OKAY. I'M

01:51:49.436 --> 01:51:51.404
CAN YOU TELL HOW MUCH PRESSURE

01:51:51.471 --> 01:51:52.439
SOMEONE IS APPLYING BY WATCHING

01:51:52.505 --> 01:51:54.240
THEM. YOU CAN BECAUSE YOU AN

01:51:54.307 --> 01:51:56.076
SEE THE COP FLEXING OR THE IF

01:51:56.142 --> 01:51:58.678
YOU'RE USING A PERSONAL TO PRO

01:51:58.745 --> 01:51:59.913
FOR YOU CAN SEE HOW MUCH THE

01:51:59.979 --> 01:52:01.648
BRUSH BRISTLES ARE FLEXING. OKAY

01:52:01.714 --> 01:52:03.783
AND WHAT IS THE COMPLICATIONS OF

01:52:03.850 --> 01:52:09.022
STEALING. SEALANTS- BASICALLY

01:52:09.089 --> 01:52:11.357
THE BIGGEST RESO THE PHOSPHORIC

01:52:11.424 --> 01:52:13.960
ACID ETCH THAT THEY'RE REFERRING

01:52:14.027 --> 01:52:17.230
TO IS NO GREATER DAMAGE THAN YOU

01:52:17.297 --> 01:52:18.898
YOUR PATIENT WHO'S DRINKING COCA

01:52:18.965 --> 01:52:20.967
COLA MOUNTAIN DEW AND SUGAR

01:52:21.034 --> 01:52:23.436
SWEETENED BEVERAGES AND ACIDIC

01:52:23.503 --> 01:52:25.305
BEVERAGES ON THE REGULAR THE-

01:52:25.371 --> 01:52:27.373
THAT PROLONGED DAMAGE- THAT A

01:52:27.440 --> 01:52:28.942
PATIENT MIGHT DO TO THEMSELVES

01:52:29.008 --> 01:52:30.777
IS GREATER THAN WHAT YOU WOULD

01:52:30.844 --> 01:52:33.446
HAVE FROM. I. TWENTY FIFTEEN TO

01:52:33.513 --> 01:52:36.282
TWENTY SECOND ASSETS- YES IT ADD

01:52:36.349 --> 01:52:38.251
SHE WANTS THE CYLINDERS ON THE

01:52:38.318 --> 01:52:39.686
CEILING AND THE BONDING AGENT

01:52:39.752 --> 01:52:41.621
ARE FILLING IN THE STRUCTURE

01:52:41.688 --> 01:52:43.223
THAT HAS BEEN ACID EDGE SO NOW

01:52:43.289 --> 01:52:44.691
THAT THAT STRUCTURE IS

01:52:44.757 --> 01:52:46.626
COMPLETELY PROTECTED. THE ASSET

01:52:46.693 --> 01:52:47.827
AS JUST PREPARES THE TWO

01:52:47.894 --> 01:52:50.263
STRUCTURES SO THAT IT CAN BONTA

01:52:50.330 --> 01:52:52.298
THOSE AGENTS ON. THE ACTUAL

01:52:52.365 --> 01:52:54.701
POLISH OR THE SEALANT THAT IS

01:52:54.767 --> 01:52:56.536
PUTTING IS FLOWN INTO THE-

01:52:56.603 --> 01:52:57.637
FLOWED INTO THE GROOVES OF THE

01:52:57.704 --> 01:53:00.073
TOOTH AND CREATES IT CREATES A

01:53:00.140 --> 01:53:02.075
SEAL SO THAT BACTERIA CANNOT GET

01:53:02.142 --> 01:53:03.042
INTO THOSE DEEP GROOVES AND

01:53:03.109 --> 01:53:04.410
BECAUSE THE CAT. THAT THE

01:53:04.477 --> 01:53:07.113
SOCIALLY LIKE A TED TO MAKE IT

01:53:07.180 --> 01:53:09.249
LIKE LAYMAN'S TERMS IT'S ALMOST

01:53:09.315 --> 01:53:10.517
LIKE A MANICURE. EXCEPT APPLIED

01:53:10.583 --> 01:53:11.951
TO THE TWO MEN TRAPPED IN THE

01:53:12.018 --> 01:53:13.219
PROPER WAY TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:53:13.286 --> 01:53:15.321
BACTERIA CONTAMINATION IS

01:53:15.388 --> 01:53:17.323
ELIMINATED AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE.

01:53:17.390 --> 01:53:19.926
AND THEN- SEALED TO SEAL OUT-

01:53:19.993 --> 01:53:22.428
THE POSSIBILITY OF- ACTOR

01:53:22.495 --> 01:53:24.397
GETTING INTO INTO THE TO THINK

01:53:24.464 --> 01:53:30.103
HOUSING- CAPPY. OKAY SO. WITH

01:53:30.170 --> 01:53:32.438
THE- POLISHING THEIR IS A RISK

01:53:32.505 --> 01:53:34.641
OF- THERMAL DAMAGE EADING TO

01:53:34.707 --> 01:53:36.476
NERVE DAMAGE WITH THE SEALANT

01:53:36.543 --> 01:53:38.344
THERE IS. YOU'RE USING SOMETHING

01:53:38.411 --> 01:53:40.947
ACIDIC SO THERE IS THAT RISK

01:53:41.014 --> 01:53:43.950
THEIR- SORRY IF YOU. IF I CAN

01:53:44.017 --> 01:53:45.785
JUST ADD ALL OF WHICH DOCTOR

01:53:45.852 --> 01:53:47.887
JUST SAID IT'S ABSOLUTELY TRUE

01:53:47.954 --> 01:53:51.224
BUT AGAIN THE ISSUE HERE IS THAT

01:53:51.291 --> 01:53:52.659
WE'RE TAKING SOMEBODY WHO'S

01:53:52.725 --> 01:53:55.161
NEVER EVEN WORKED POTENTIALLY IN

01:53:55.228 --> 01:53:56.930
A PATIENT'S MOUTH WITH MINIMAL

01:53:56.996 --> 01:53:58.932
TRAINING BEING ABLE TO DO THESE

01:53:58.998 --> 01:54:00.934
DUTIES WHICH HAS JUST BEEN SAID

01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:03.770
WE ARE TAKING AWAY SERVICES OF

01:54:03.836 --> 01:54:06.105
THE ENAMEL THAT YOU CAN'T GET

01:54:06.172 --> 01:54:08.741
BACK TO THESE ARE. IRREVERSIBLE

01:54:08.808 --> 01:54:11.377
DUTIES THAT COULD POTENTIALLY BE

01:54:11.444 --> 01:54:12.845
DONE BY SOMEBODY WHO DOESN'T

01:54:12.912 --> 01:54:15.515
EVEN KNOW HOW TO RENTS AN

01:54:15.582 --> 01:54:16.783
ASPIRATE MUCH LAST. USE THE HAND

01:54:16.849 --> 01:54:18.851
PIECE IN THE MOUTH AND

01:54:18.918 --> 01:54:21.221
PHOSPHORIC ACID. RIGHT OKAY WELL

01:54:21.287 --> 01:54:23.623
MY QUESTION I WAS GOING TO BE SO

01:54:23.690 --> 01:54:26.292
WE TALKED ABOUT- THE POTENTIAL

01:54:26.359 --> 01:54:27.460
NERVE DAMAGE WE TALKED ABOUT THE

01:54:27.527 --> 01:54:29.362
AESTHETIC. AND YOU HAD STATED

01:54:29.429 --> 01:54:31.431
BEFORE THAT DENTAL ASSISTANTS

01:54:31.497 --> 01:54:32.999
HAVE SIMILAR RISK WITH THE

01:54:33.066 --> 01:54:34.033
THINGS THAT THEY ARE ALLOWED TO

01:54:34.100 --> 01:54:36.769
DO LOOKING AT WHAT THEY ARE

01:54:36.836 --> 01:54:39.606
ALLOWED TO DO WHAT IS. WHAT IS

01:54:39.672 --> 01:54:41.441
IT THAT THEY DO NOW THAT HAS

01:54:41.507 --> 01:54:43.943
SIMILAR RISKS TO WHAT WE ARE

01:54:44.010 --> 01:54:45.678
PROPOSING OR WHAT YOU ARE

01:54:45.745 --> 01:54:48.348
PROPOSING. CHAIR PLACING AND

01:54:48.414 --> 01:54:50.149
REMOVING RUBBER DAMS- THERE'S A

01:54:50.216 --> 01:54:52.685
CLAMP THAT COULD IF IMPROPERLY

01:54:52.752 --> 01:54:54.954
PLACED IMPINGE ON THE TISSUE. I

01:54:55.021 --> 01:54:56.623
AM PLACING AND THAT WOULD CAUSE

01:54:56.689 --> 01:54:58.157
NERVE DAMAGE NOT NERVE DAMAGE

01:54:58.224 --> 01:55:00.593
BUT WOULD COME BECAUSE- DAMAGE

01:55:00.660 --> 01:55:03.196
TO THE GUM TISSUE AND- APERI

01:55:03.263 --> 01:55:04.631
DONNELLY COMPROMISE PATIENT THAT

01:55:04.697 --> 01:55:07.066
TISSUE DAMAGE COULD BE LONGER

01:55:07.133 --> 01:55:10.570
TERM- SAME THING WITH PLACING

01:55:10.637 --> 01:55:12.205
WEDGING AND REMOVING MATRICES

01:55:12.272 --> 01:55:14.274
FOR SORT OF PRODUCT- PROCEDURES

01:55:14.340 --> 01:55:17.210
THAT- THOSE. METERS FANS CAN

01:55:17.277 --> 01:55:19.746
OPERATE THE GUM TISSUE-

01:55:19.812 --> 01:55:22.715
TEMPORARILY AND IT HEALS- INTER

01:55:22.782 --> 01:55:25.318
AURAL IMPRESSIONS- THERE ARE

01:55:25.385 --> 01:55:27.120
SITUATIONS WHERE A PATIENT COULD

01:55:27.186 --> 01:55:29.722
GAG. ON THE MATERIAL IF NOT DONE

01:55:29.789 --> 01:55:31.624
PROPERLY AND EVEN IF DONE

01:55:31.691 --> 01:55:32.759
PROPERLY AND THAT APPLIES TO ANY

01:55:32.825 --> 01:55:34.193
OF THESE I EAT ANY OF THESE

01:55:34.260 --> 01:55:35.962
PROCEDURES DONE PROPERLY STILL

01:55:36.029 --> 01:55:37.964
RUN RISKS OF SMALL THINGS.

01:55:38.031 --> 01:55:39.932
HAPPENING WITH THAT ARE USUALLY-

01:55:39.999 --> 01:55:43.136
SOMETHING THAT THE PATIENT CAN

01:55:43.202 --> 01:55:44.137
RECOVER FROM WITH MINIMAL

01:55:44.203 --> 01:55:45.438
INCIDENT- AND THAT'S THE SAME

01:55:45.505 --> 01:55:47.940
MATT THAT WOULD GO THE SAME WAY

01:55:48.007 --> 01:55:49.275
AS- PROFI POLISHING. SO THE

01:55:49.342 --> 01:55:51.277
PATIENT GAGS WHAT ARE YOU

01:55:51.344 --> 01:55:52.879
CONCERNED ABOUT ASPIRATION.

01:55:52.945 --> 01:55:57.116
ASPIRATION VOMITING-

01:55:57.183 --> 01:55:57.750
ACCIDENTALLY SWALLOWING MATERIAL

01:55:57.817 --> 01:56:01.688
THAT'S. I'M ADDITIONALLY

01:56:01.754 --> 01:56:03.656
REMOVING ORTHODONTIC SEPARATOR

01:56:03.723 --> 01:56:05.291
SOMETIMES ORTHODONTIC SEPARATORS

01:56:05.358 --> 01:56:07.493
CAN BE MISPLACED AND GO TO START

01:56:07.560 --> 01:56:11.564
TO FIRE SUBSTANTIVELY- REMOVING

01:56:11.631 --> 01:56:13.333
SUTURES YOU COULD ACCIDENTALLY

01:56:13.399 --> 01:56:15.368
INJURE A PATIENT REMOVING

01:56:15.435 --> 01:56:16.369
SUTURES BY I ACCIDENTALLY

01:56:16.436 --> 01:56:19.305
CUTTING THEM. I'M SO ALL OF

01:56:19.372 --> 01:56:20.606
THESE THINGS ARE ARE VERY

01:56:20.673 --> 01:56:22.275
IMPORTANT TO TRAIN OUR

01:56:22.342 --> 01:56:24.110
ASSISTANCE IN AND WE AS THE

01:56:24.177 --> 01:56:26.112
DENTISTS ARE RESPONSIBLE AND

01:56:26.179 --> 01:56:27.980
LIABLE FOR ANY OF THOSE THINGS

01:56:28.047 --> 01:56:29.615
THAT HAPPEN. I LIKE THE

01:56:29.682 --> 01:56:31.084
AMENDMENTS THAT WERE PROPOSED BY

01:56:31.150 --> 01:56:32.352
THE COMMITTEE BECAUSE IT

01:56:32.418 --> 01:56:33.553
STRENGTHENS THOSE THOSE

01:56:33.619 --> 01:56:35.588
PROTECTIONS ABOUT THE TYPE OF

01:56:35.655 --> 01:56:37.156
TRAINING AND THE AMOUNT OF

01:56:37.223 --> 01:56:38.224
TRAINING THAT THEY'RE GOING TO

01:56:38.291 --> 01:56:39.359
GET THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE

01:56:39.425 --> 01:56:41.494
DOING THESE PROCEDURES WITHIN A

01:56:41.561 --> 01:56:42.895
MONTH OF HIRING THEY'RE GOING TO

01:56:42.962 --> 01:56:44.630
BE TRAINING ON THE JOB. MAN THIS

01:56:44.697 --> 01:56:46.532
IS SOMETHING THAT THEY CAN

01:56:46.599 --> 01:56:49.335
DEVELOP BUT THE- DIFFICULTY WE

01:56:49.402 --> 01:56:51.337
HAVE IS THESE ASSISTANCE CAN

01:56:51.404 --> 01:56:55.041
GOING GET THESE CERTIFICATES AND

01:56:55.108 --> 01:56:57.343
LEARN THIS SKILL AND THESE ARE

01:56:57.410 --> 01:56:59.312
SKILLS THAT ARE APPROVED BY THE

01:56:59.379 --> 01:57:00.646
DENTAL BOARD OF CALIFORNIA AND

01:57:00.713 --> 01:57:02.815
PROVIDED BY THE DENTAL ASSISTANT

01:57:02.882 --> 01:57:05.618
PROGRAMS- THEY TAKE THESE THESE

01:57:05.685 --> 01:57:07.220
CERTIFICATE PROGRAMS AND THEN

01:57:07.286 --> 01:57:09.789
THEY CAN'T USE THEM ON THE JOB.

01:57:09.856 --> 01:57:11.891
AND SO WE ACTUALLY SEE IN IN-

01:57:11.958 --> 01:57:14.293
ENVELOPING THIS N. THAT DA SCOPE

01:57:14.360 --> 01:57:16.329
WILL GIVE THEM A CHANCE TO USE

01:57:16.396 --> 01:57:18.664
THOSE SKILLS AND ADVANCE SO THAT

01:57:18.731 --> 01:57:20.066
THEY HAVE MORE OF A SKILL

01:57:20.133 --> 01:57:22.068
DEVELOPMENT LADDER INTO GO INTO

01:57:22.135 --> 01:57:24.871
BECOMING AN RGA. WE WANT MORE RT

01:57:24.937 --> 01:57:28.341
AS WE DON'T WANT HIM TO HAVE-

01:57:28.408 --> 01:57:30.243
LET'S TRAIN DA'S WE WANT OUR

FUNCTIONAL AND LICENSE AS

01:57:33.112 --> 01:57:35.181
POSSIBLE BUT WE DO BELIEVE THAT

01:57:35.248 --> 01:57:36.716
THIS CREATES A PATHWAY. FOR

01:57:36.783 --> 01:57:38.751
DEVELOPING THOSE SKILLS IN A

01:57:38.818 --> 01:57:40.787
STEPWISE MANNER SO THAT THEY

01:57:40.853 --> 01:57:43.556
CAN- EVENTUALLY MOVE FORWARD

01:57:43.623 --> 01:57:47.393
INTO RDA POSITIONS AND GREATER

01:57:47.460 --> 01:57:48.694
RESPONSIBILITY. YOUR DENTAL IS

AS AS THE- RDAS. THEY THEY HAVE

01:58:05.144 --> 01:58:07.647

GREATEST. MAYBE SOMETHING WALKIE

01:58:15.621 --> 01:58:16.589
WITH ANATOMY THAT THERE THAT

01:58:16.656 --> 01:58:20.426
THEY MAY NOT HAVE PICKED UP ON

01:58:20.493 --> 01:58:21.994
IN THERE- ON THE JOB TRAINING.

01:58:22.061 --> 01:58:24.797
THEN ASSISTANCE DO NOT HAVE ANY

01:58:24.864 --> 01:58:26.732
REQUIRED COURSEWORK. THEY DON'T

01:58:26.799 --> 01:58:28.401
HAVE TO AFTER THEY'VE TAKEN THE

01:58:28.468 --> 01:58:29.402
INFECTION CONTROL IN THE DPA

01:58:29.469 --> 01:58:31.070
THEIR FIRST YEAR THEY NEVER HAVE

01:58:31.137 --> 01:58:33.072
TO DO IT AGAIN. IF THEY STAY IN

01:58:33.139 --> 01:58:35.308
THE D. A. CATEGORY- THEY DON'T

01:58:35.374 --> 01:58:36.642
HAVE ANY CONTINUING EDUCATION

01:58:36.709 --> 01:58:38.444
REQUIREMENTS AND IN FACT THE

01:58:38.511 --> 01:58:40.279
DENTAL BOARD OF CALIFORNIA HAS

01:58:40.346 --> 01:58:42.949
NO JURISDICTION OVER. THE

01:58:43.015 --> 01:58:44.851
UNLICENSED DENTAL ASSISTANT AND

01:58:44.917 --> 01:58:46.519
THAT IS ONE OF OUR OTHER

01:58:46.586 --> 01:58:47.653
CONCERNS HERE IS THAT THEY'D BE

01:58:47.720 --> 01:58:49.622
ABLE TO DO THESE PROCEDURES AND

01:58:49.689 --> 01:58:51.891
NOT HAVE TO CONTINUE THEIR

01:58:51.958 --> 01:58:52.859
EDUCATION BECAUSE ARE NOT

01:58:52.925 --> 01:58:59.198
LICENSED- YOU KNOW I AM.

01:58:59.265 --> 01:59:03.503
CONCERNED WITH- EXPANDING THE

01:59:03.569 --> 01:59:07.874
SCOPE WITHOUT AYE EXPANDING.

01:59:07.940 --> 01:59:09.675
TRAINING AND TO HAVE COMPARABLE

01:59:09.742 --> 01:59:12.111
TRAINING- AND THAT'S WHY I BEGAN

01:59:12.178 --> 01:59:14.213
WITH ASKING WHAT IS YOU KNOW THE

01:59:14.280 --> 01:59:16.883
TIME REQUIREMENT TO BECOME- A

HOW PEOPLE GROW IN THE FIELD AND

01:59:27.126 --> 01:59:28.494
I BELIEVE THAT THERE IS A

01:59:28.561 --> 01:59:31.531
PROCESS FOR THAT- I WASN'T

01:59:31.597 --> 01:59:35.401
REALLY SURE WHAT THE OVERALL-

01:59:35.468 --> 01:59:36.602
REASONING FOR THE BILL WISE

01:59:36.669 --> 01:59:38.371
BECAUSE I WOULD AS I WAS READING

01:59:38.437 --> 01:59:39.605
IT WAS STATING SOMETHING ABOUT

01:59:39.672 --> 01:59:41.207
THERE BEING A SHORTAGE. OF

DENTAL ASSISTANTS. BUT I DON'T

01:59:43.809 --> 01:59:45.011
UNDERSTAND HOW EXPANDING THEIR

01:59:45.077 --> 01:59:47.580
SCOPE WOULD INCREASE THE NUMBER

01:59:47.647 --> 01:59:50.049

LEGISLATURE HAS DONE AN

BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER LEE IS

02:02:25.571 --> 02:02:27.373
TRAUMATIC ENOUGH- ESPECIALLY I

02:02:27.440 --> 02:02:29.642
WOULD SAY PEDIATRIC DENTISTRY IS

02:02:29.709 --> 02:02:32.078
ONE OF THE HARDEST OF FIELDS OUT

02:02:32.144 --> 02:02:34.814
THERE- DOING THIS TYPE OF WORK

02:02:34.880 --> 02:02:36.682
FOR CHILDREN AND REALLY FOR ALL

02:02:36.749 --> 02:02:38.584
ALL ADULTS THAT- WE FEEL

02:02:38.651 --> 02:02:40.586
INCREDIBLY UNCOMFORTABLE ALREADY

02:02:40.653 --> 02:02:42.588
AND FOR. THOSE OF YOU THAT THAT

02:02:42.655 --> 02:02:44.023
KNOW ME AND KNOW ME WELL KNOW

02:02:44.090 --> 02:02:46.559
THAT I WOULD NEVER PUT A BILL

02:02:46.625 --> 02:02:47.159
FOR THAT ACTUALLY JEOPARDIZES

02:02:47.226 --> 02:02:48.461
THE WORKFORCE OR JOBS FOR PEOPLE

02:02:48.527 --> 02:02:50.129
THAT ARE ALREADY DOING THIS TYPE

02:02:50.196 --> 02:02:51.230
OF WORK THAT'S NOT WHERE I COME

02:02:51.297 --> 02:02:53.566
FROM IT'S NOT MY PHILOSOPHY NOR

02:02:53.632 --> 02:02:54.467
MY VALUES. WHAT ARE MY VALUES

02:02:54.533 --> 02:02:56.001
THOUGH ARE WORKING WITH THE

02:02:56.068 --> 02:02:57.837
OPPOSITION AND I'M SAD TO REPORT

02:02:57.903 --> 02:02:59.038
THAT DESPITE MULTIPLE ATTEMPTS

02:02:59.105 --> 02:03:02.441
TO WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION. AS

02:03:02.508 --> 02:03:03.943
WELL AS THE SPONSORS TO WORK

02:03:04.009 --> 02:03:05.611
WITH THE OPPOSITION THEY

INITIALLY SAID YES WE WILL WORK

WITH YOU AND THEN COMPLETELY

02:03:08.380 --> 02:03:10.382
DECLINED SO I DON'T THINK THAT

02:03:10.449 --> 02:03:12.518
THAT'S ACTUALLY A GOOD WAY TO DO

02:03:12.585 --> 02:03:14.854
WORK OR POLICY. AND SO- THE

02:03:14.920 --> 02:03:16.722
COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS MAKE THAT
