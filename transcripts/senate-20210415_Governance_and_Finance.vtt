SUFFICIENT PLANNING HAS NOT

00:12:44.563 --> 00:12:46.765
BEEN DONE- WE KNOW THAT THE

RESILIENCY EFFORTS AND

00:12:47.867 --> 00:12:50.436
HARDENING- CAN BE A HUGE FACTOR

00:12:50.503 --> 00:12:52.104
IN KEEPING HOME STANDING IN THE

00:12:52.171 --> 00:12:53.572
BUILDING STANDARDS ESPECIALLY

00:12:53.639 --> 00:12:55.274
APPLYING THEM BEYOND JUST THE

00:12:58.511 --> 00:13:00.546
EFFECTIVE PREVENTION METHOD AS

00:13:00.613 --> 00:13:03.149
WELL- BUT IT'S NOT ENOUGH OF

00:13:03.215 --> 00:13:04.650
THE LOSSES WE'VE SEEN IN

00:13:04.717 --> 00:13:06.819

00:13:36.282 --> 00:13:38.517
AND TRY TO FIND A WAY IN THIS

00:13:38.584 --> 00:13:39.652
BILL TO AT LEAST PUT AN IDEA

00:13:39.718 --> 00:13:41.687
OUT THERE. ABOUT A DENSITY

00:13:41.754 --> 00:13:44.156
BONUS- TO ACCOMPANY ANY

00:13:44.223 --> 00:13:46.358
LIMITATIONS IN DEVELOPMENT OF

00:13:46.425 --> 00:13:48.427
FIRE ZONES SO THAT INFILL

00:13:48.494 --> 00:13:49.795
DEVELOPMENT ANOTHER SUSTAINABLE

00:13:49.862 --> 00:13:51.497
DEVELOPMENT WOULD BE SUPER

00:13:51.564 --> 00:13:52.898
CHARGED IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO JUST

00:13:52.965 --> 00:13:54.366
SAY NO I THINK WE'VE GOT TO SAY

00:13:54.433 --> 00:13:57.436
YES AND SAY YES TWICE AS MUCH-

00:13:57.503 --> 00:13:59.104
BUT THE FACT IS THAT. THE

00:13:59.171 --> 00:14:01.173
DEVELOPMENTS IN THESE HIGH FIRE

00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:02.441
SEVERITY ZONES DON'T TEND TO BE

00:14:02.508 --> 00:14:03.943
AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THEY ARE

00:14:04.009 --> 00:14:06.045
NOT NECESSARILY THOSE THAT ARE

00:14:06.111 --> 00:14:07.112
INTENDED TO ADDRESS THE HOUSING

00:14:07.179 --> 00:14:09.114

00:14:15.387 --> 00:14:16.789
INTO HARM'S WAY. THAT ARE

00:14:16.855 --> 00:14:17.690
INHERENTLY GOING TO BE

00:14:17.756 --> 00:14:19.692
SUBSIDIZED BY THOSE NOT LIVING

00:14:19.758 --> 00:14:21.927
IN FIRE ZONES INTO THOSE LIVING

00:14:21.994 --> 00:14:23.729

00:18:00.045 --> 00:18:00.879
THIRTY FIVE IS A BILL THAT

00:18:00.946 --> 00:18:02.781

BUILDING AFFORDABLE HOUSING LOW

00:18:12.624 --> 00:18:15.828
RISK AREA. IT SAYS NO KIND OF

00:18:15.894 --> 00:18:18.197
RISKY HOUSING WITHOUT PLANNING

00:18:18.263 --> 00:18:20.065
WHILE SAYING YEAH OTHER STATE I

00:18:20.132 --> 00:18:20.933
THINK THAT'S EXACTLY THE

00:18:20.999 --> 00:18:23.335
DIRECTION CALIFORNIA HAD IN ITS

00:18:23.402 --> 00:18:26.638
HOUSING POLICY WITH RESPECT TO

00:18:26.705 --> 00:18:28.474
WILDFIRE. I WE THE REALITY IS

00:18:28.540 --> 00:18:30.442
AS AS- SENATOR WHAT IRON

00:18:30.509 --> 00:18:32.711

TENS OF THOUSANDS OF HOUSING

00:18:33.679 --> 00:18:36.949
UNITS WILDFIRE. AND THAT'S EVEN

00:18:37.015 --> 00:18:38.317
AS WE STRUGGLE TO BUILD ENOUGH

00:18:38.383 --> 00:18:41.353
NEW HOUSING MAKE IT. CALIFORNIA

00:18:41.420 --> 00:18:42.421
CAN YOU TO BE IN AFFORDABLE

00:18:42.488 --> 00:18:45.123
ATTRACTIVE PLACE. FOR FAMILIES

00:18:45.190 --> 00:18:47.192
TO LIVE. CATASTROPHIC FIRES

00:18:47.259 --> 00:18:49.027
ALSO HAD A BIG IMPACT ON THE

00:18:49.094 --> 00:18:50.896
PEOPLE WHOSE HOMES BURNED DOWN

00:18:50.963 --> 00:18:52.798
ALSO ON RENTERS IN NEARBY

00:18:52.865 --> 00:18:54.132
COMMUNITIES BECAUSE INSURANCE

00:18:54.199 --> 00:18:56.134
COMPENSATION FOR FIRE VICTIMS

00:18:56.201 --> 00:18:58.170
LOSE. REPLACEMENT HOUSE. THOUGH

00:18:58.237 --> 00:18:59.605
IN SANTA ROSA AND KEEP OUT OF

00:18:59.671 --> 00:19:01.440
THIS BUT A WIDESPREAD BRENT.

00:19:01.507 --> 00:19:04.009
AND ELECTION FOR LONGTIME

00:19:04.076 --> 00:19:05.077
RESIDENTS. AFTER THE TOP

00:19:05.143 --> 00:19:07.179
EMPIRES POUNDING THE COMMUNITY

00:19:07.246 --> 00:19:08.380
IMPACT OF THESE NATURAL

00:19:08.447 --> 00:19:12.084
DISASTERS. I THINK SB FIFTY

00:19:12.150 --> 00:19:13.452
FIVE IN A KIND OF PLANNING THAT

00:19:13.519 --> 00:19:15.888
IT REQUIRES IS CRITICALLY

00:19:15.954 --> 00:19:18.390
IMPORTANT RIGHT NOW BECAUSE

00:19:18.457 --> 00:19:19.791
OVER THE LIFETIME OF THE HOUSE

00:19:19.858 --> 00:19:22.528
INSTRUCTED TODAY CLIMATE CHANGE

00:19:22.594 --> 00:19:23.462
AND CONTINUE TO GET WORSE

00:19:23.529 --> 00:19:24.730
DESPITE THE EFFORTS OF THE

00:19:24.796 --> 00:19:26.865
STATE OF CALIFORNIA THE UNITED

00:19:26.932 --> 00:19:27.566
STATES AND THE GLOBAL EFFORTS

00:19:27.633 --> 00:19:30.202
ON CLIMATE. THE RISKS ARE VERY

00:19:30.269 --> 00:19:31.236
LIKELY TO DRAMATICALLY

00:19:31.303 --> 00:19:33.872
INCREASE- OR HOUSE IS LOCATED

00:19:33.939 --> 00:19:36.074
IN THE BEER AT HIGH AND

00:19:36.141 --> 00:19:39.011
MODERATE- BOB PERHAPS ARE. THE

00:19:39.077 --> 00:19:41.280
CURRENT SCIENCE THE BEST WE

00:19:41.346 --> 00:19:44.049
UNDERSTAND IT YES THAT TWENTY

00:19:44.116 --> 00:19:45.050
TO FORTY FIRE SEASON LIKE THE

00:19:45.117 --> 00:19:47.185
ONE WE JUST EXPERIENCED WERE

00:19:47.252 --> 00:19:48.353
FOUR MILLION ACRES BURNING

00:19:48.420 --> 00:19:51.423
CALIFORNIA COULD BE. AVERAGE

00:19:51.490 --> 00:19:53.759
NOT TO ORDINARY THAT MEANS WE

00:19:53.825 --> 00:19:55.193
NEED TO BE THINKING AHEAD

00:19:55.260 --> 00:19:56.795
PARTICULARLY FOR LONG LIVED

00:19:56.862 --> 00:20:00.299
ASSETS LIKE- NEW DEVELOPMENT AS

00:20:00.365 --> 00:20:04.736
WE PLAN. ON IT WE DO HAS ARE

00:20:04.803 --> 00:20:05.337
PLANNING. IN ADDITION PASSED

00:20:05.404 --> 00:20:06.672
THE POINT OUT THE COST OF THIS

00:20:06.738 --> 00:20:08.006
NEW HOUSING INTO BARS OF

00:20:08.073 --> 00:20:09.241
PRESSURE THE POTENTIAL GROWING

00:20:09.308 --> 00:20:11.109
LAST YEAR WE SPENT MORE THAN

00:20:11.176 --> 00:20:11.643
THREE BILLION ON WILDFIRE

00:20:11.710 --> 00:20:15.280

MAJOR OBLIGATION THE TAXPAYERS

01:12:14.763 --> 01:12:17.666
OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WE

01:12:17.733 --> 01:12:19.902
HAVE A VERY PROBLEMATIC

01:12:19.968 --> 01:12:22.037
SITUATION OF THE BONDED

01:12:22.104 --> 01:12:22.604
INDEBTEDNESS OCCURRED OVER

01:12:22.671 --> 01:12:26.542
DECADES IN THE STATE. ONE OF

01:12:26.608 --> 01:12:27.609
THE THINGS THAT HAVE HAPPENED

01:12:27.676 --> 01:12:29.378
AS MANY MORE IDEAS NOW OR

01:12:29.445 --> 01:12:30.646
SEEKING FUNDING FROM BOND

01:12:30.713 --> 01:12:33.549
SOURCES. THE DEBT ON THE

01:12:33.615 --> 01:12:37.019
TAXPAYERS. AS THIS PARTICULAR

01:12:37.086 --> 01:12:39.621
BILL IS CONCERNED IT'S AN AREA

01:12:39.688 --> 01:12:41.557
WHERE I HAVE GREAT INTEREST AND

01:12:41.623 --> 01:12:43.592
I THINK THERE'S MUCH IN THIS

01:12:43.659 --> 01:12:45.894
THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL. I TOO

01:12:45.961 --> 01:12:47.129
WOULD THINK AMENDMENTS IN TERMS

01:12:47.196 --> 01:12:49.031
OF HOW THINGS ARE APPROPRIATED

01:12:49.098 --> 01:12:52.568
AND THERE'S A MEASURE. WHAT HAS

01:12:52.634 --> 01:12:54.069
BEEN OF CONCERN TO ME OVER

01:12:54.136 --> 01:12:55.704
DECADES OF BOTH FROM THE

01:12:55.771 --> 01:12:57.539
LEGISLATURE AND FROM OUTSIDE

01:12:57.606 --> 01:12:59.475
INTEREST HOW THESE THINGS GET

01:12:59.541 --> 01:13:01.176
TO BE A BIG PORK BARREL BY YOUR

01:13:01.243 --> 01:13:05.314
VOTE. KIND OF PROPOSITIONS. I'M

01:13:05.380 --> 01:13:07.149
NOT ACCUSING US OF BEING SUCH

01:13:07.216 --> 01:13:09.618
BUT IT HAS THE POTENTIAL. THE

01:13:09.685 --> 01:13:10.152
POINT I WANT TO DO WELL ON

01:13:10.219 --> 01:13:12.588
THOUGH. I'M TRYING TO

01:13:12.654 --> 01:13:15.324
CONCEPTUALIZE A MATTER AND WAY

01:13:15.390 --> 01:13:18.227
OR BY THE LEGISLATURE CAN

01:13:18.293 --> 01:13:20.562
PROVIDE HAVE OVERSIGHT. OF HOW

01:13:20.629 --> 01:13:21.764
THE EXPENDITURES OF THESE BOND

01:13:21.830 --> 01:13:25.334
FUNDS. ARE BEING MADE SO THERE

01:13:25.400 --> 01:13:26.902
CAN BE AN ACCOUNTABILITY

01:13:26.969 --> 01:13:28.270
INSTEAD OF JUST THROWING

01:13:28.337 --> 01:13:29.972
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OUT THERE

01:13:30.038 --> 01:13:30.939
TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE

01:13:31.006 --> 01:13:32.641
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS GO TO

01:13:32.708 --> 01:13:34.843
CONSTRUCTIVE PURPOSES AND WITH

01:13:34.910 --> 01:13:37.045
CONCRETE RESULTS. WE REALLY

01:13:37.112 --> 01:13:40.048
DON'T HAVE THAT THE OVERSIGHT

01:13:40.115 --> 01:13:41.984
IS MINOR IF ANY AT ALL.

01:13:42.050 --> 01:13:43.218
ALTHOUGH I CREDIT THE BUDGET

01:13:43.285 --> 01:13:44.787

ON OVERSIGHT WE HAVE ACCEPTED

01:13:54.797 --> 01:13:56.064

BE COMING FORWARD THIS WOULD BE

01:14:12.815 --> 01:14:13.849

THE BONDED INDEBTEDNESS

01:15:00.462 --> 01:15:01.430
QUESTION WE WANT TO MAKE SURE
