FIVE WANT TO THANK THE MEMBERS WHO HERE COLLEGE EYES FOR THINGS OVERLAPPING UNFORTUNATELY IN MY OFFICE AND SO- WAS DELAYED IN GETTING HERE BUT I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR OUR FIRST MEETING. OUR AGENDA TODAY IS NOT A VERY LONG TWO ITEMS- BUT WE HOPE THAT THE THAT AGENDA WILL BE INFORMATIVE AND HELPFUL- WE'RE GOING TO BEGIN WITH ITEM. FIFTY TWO TWENTY FIVE AND THE FIRST ON THE ASACOL THE ROLE. WEBER HERE JONES SAWYER LACKEY. MELENDEZ STONE HEY WE DO HAVE A QUORUM- WE'RE NOT VOTING ON ANY ITEMS TODAY BUT WE DO HAVE A QUORUM FOR THE MEETING SO WE'RE GONNA BEGIN WITH ISSUE NUMBER ONE WHICH IS ALL ISSUES UNDERNEATH THE DEPARTMENT TO CALVIN PART OF CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION OF ONE TO DEAL WITH THE POPULATION OVER VIEW IN THE GOVERNOR'S UP PRISON CLOSURE PROPOSAL- SO WILLOWS WHO ARE SCHEDULED TO PRESENT THE PALACE SOMEONE FROM CDC OUR- DEPARTMENT FINANCE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S AND DON SPECTER WHO WAS A PRISON LAW OFFICE. BUT. THEY WERE GOING TO BEGIN WITH THE CDC ARE. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR WOMAN- GOOD AFTERNOON AND ASSEMBLY MEMBERS. WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE INVITE TODAY TO TALK ABOUT THESE TWO REALLY IMPORTANT ISSUES ONE ABOUT THE POPULATION IN THE NEXT SUBJECT REGARDING THE ALLEGATION INQUIRE MANAGEMENT SECTION. BUT YOU KNOW FIRST OF ALL I WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE POPULATION HAS REALLY BEEN ON THE SUBJECT- THAN THIS OF THE A LOT OF CONVERSATION I'VE BEEN WITH- WITH PEOPLE AND- I'LL JUST SORT OF WITH THE RAW NUMBERS AS OF THIS MORNING WE ARE AT- HUNDRED TWENTY THREE THOUSAND AND TWENTY THREE INMATES. THAT FIGURE REPRESENTS ABOUT FOUR FIVE FORTY TWO THOUSAND INMATES LESS SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND TEN. THAT'S ABOUT 2025% REDUCTION OVER THE PAST TEN YEARS. THE POPULATION QUESTION ASKED SPECIFICALLY ABOUT REDUCTIONS AND THAT'S A LOT OF THE CONVERSATIONS I'VE BEEN HAVING REDUCTIONS IN WHAT. WHAT WE CAN DO AS A DEPARTMENT TO BRING DOWN FACILITIES EVER SINCE THE GOVERNOR MADE. I THINK- THE RIGHT COMMENT IN THAT WITHIN THE NEXT FIVE YEARS WE WILL BRING DOWN A FACILITY. BUT FOR ME AS A SECRETARY- DIRECTING THE DEPARTMENT OF COMMUNICATING. TO THE AGENCIES AS BIG AS IT IS- I THINK  HAVE TO LOOKING AT THE COMMUNICATE BEYOND THE NUMBERS ITSELF. THE NUMBERS TO ME REPRESENT PEOPLE. I THINK WHAT ON THE SURFACE EVERY BEING BEHIND EVERY PERSON IS A NUMBER WOULD NEEDS CONCERNS AND EARS- THAT'S EVERYONE INVOLVED THAT'S THE INMATE POPULATION THAT THE STAFF IN THE COMMUNITY AND EVERYBODY THAT COMES IN PROVIDE SERVICES. INTO THE INSTITUTION- THIS FOR ME THIS CHANGE OF THINKING FROM NUMBERS TO PEOPLE. REALLY PART OF THE TRANSFORMATION OF THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND HOW WE ARE RECOGNIZING. OUR OUR REQUIREMENT TO REACH THE NEEDS OF THE INDIVIDUAL THAT ARE SENT TO US. TO PREPARE THEM FOR THE ONE DAY THAT WILL BE RETURNING HOME. THE EMPLOYEES THE CDC ARE SEEK- I BELIEVE THE SECRET GREATER PURPOSE. BASIC THE ABILITY TO REACH INDIVIDUALS BEYOND YEARS PAST WHEN WE WERE JUST REALLY HOUSING PEOPLE- THE DAYS OF OVERCROWDING- WHICH WAS NOT A GOOD DAY. THE DAYS AND WE HAD A LOT OF STATE WHEN WE HAD MORE IN STATE WE HAD IN TRIPLE BONTA WE HAD A MAN DAY ROOMS- IT'S A DIFFERENT DAY. IN CORRECTIONS WE HAVE CHALLENGES AND WE HAVE SOME ISSUES TO TAX. IN A BETTER. I BELIEVE LONG PURPOSE REALLY TO TAKE A LOOK AT OUR POPULATION OF MORE POINT OF THE STAFF TO PROVIDE THE SERVICES BECAUSE WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT IS OVER SIXTY THOUSAND EMPLOYEES IN THE DEPARTMENT ONE OF THE THINGS I AM CONCERNED WITH ON TOP OF INMATE REHABILITATION REENTRY IS ALSO THE EMPLOYEES THAT PROVIDE THE SERVICES. BECAUSE THEY ALSO ARE AFFECTED AND I BELIEVE THESE POPULATION REDUCTIONS HAVE HELPED US IN A PROVIDE DISABILITY TO CHANGE HOW WE REACH THE INMATES ARE SENT TO US FROM THE FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT- IF YOU HAVEN'T ALREADY PLEASE TAKE A LOOK AT THE VISION AND MISSION STATEMENT. THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION HAS RECENTLY CHANGED. IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT IT IT IS QUITE DIFFERENT THAN IT WAS YEARS AGO IT IS MORE A MISSION STATEMENT THAT'S- MORE DRIVEN TOWARDS THE NEEDS OF THE INDIVIDUALS WITH THE ULTIMATE GOAL OF RE ENTRY. BACK INTO OUR COMMUNITIES. BUT THEY CAN JUST GOING BACK TO THE POPULATION QUESTION. THE REDUCTIONS HAVE BEEN MADE POSSIBLE BY. TOO MANY AVENUES THROUGH A VARIETY OF LEGISLATION VOTER APPROVED INITIATIVES. SOME OF THEM INCLUDE AND I WON'T GET INTO THE DETAILS AB ONE OH NINE PROPERTY SIX PROP FORTY SEVEN AND MOST RECENTLY. PROP FIFTY SEVEN. WHICH I BELIEVE. HAS REALLY CHANGED THE LANDSCAPE OF CORRECTIONS AND HOW ARE STAFF OR PROVIDING SERVICES TO THE INMATES. AND FOCUSING ON PUTTING THE ARE IN ITS RIGHTFUL PLACE IN REHABILITATION THE CDC ARE. IT WAS CHANGED IN TWO THOUSAND AND SIX BUT I. YOU KNOW JUST THROUGH THE RECESSION IN TOUGH TIMES. IT REALLY MEANS MORE NOW THAN IN TIME ELSE- WE'RE DEALING WITH LESS INMATES. WERE DEALING WITH THE ABILITY TO RUN. A DIFFERENT WAY. TO PROVIDE BETTER REENTRY COMMUNICATING WITH A PROBATION PARTNERS- AND ALSO THE COMMUNITY. TO LET THEM KNOW WHAT THE IMAGE ARE BEING PROVIDED WHEN THEY DO GO HOME. AND TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE A CONTINUITY OF CARE STATUS WITH THEM- WHAT WE HAVE- INCREASED- UNDER THE AUTHORITY CREDIT EARNINGS AND INTOTHIS WAR CREDIT FOR INMATES PARTICIPATING IN. VARIOUS REHAB PROGRAMS INCLUDING HIGH SCHOOL AND COLLEGE PROGRAMS FACE FACE COLLAGEN THIRTY FOUR OF OUR INSTITUTIONS. IT'S LIKE NO OTHER AND NOW WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION COMING UP FOR THE INTEGRATED SUBSTANCE ABUSE DISORDER TREATMENT WHICH I THINK IS A- IS SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN LONG OVERDUE IN OUR PRISON SYSTEM. THE ONE PIECE OF THE- POPULATION REDUCTIONS THAT DON'T THAT DOESN'T TALKED ABOUT VERY MUCH AND THAT'S THE AUTHORITY VESTED IN CORRECTIONS IN THE ELEVEN SEVENTY D. IN THE PENAL CODE. AND WHAT THAT DOES IT ALLOW THE SECRETARY TO REFER INMATES BACK TO SENSING COURSE FOR VARIOUS REASONS EITHER CHANGES IN LOS SENSING DISCREPANCIES- BUT ALSO I THINK ONE OF THE IMPORTANT ONES IT'S TO- REFER CASES. BACK TO FENCING COURTS RECOGNIZING THE INMATES HAVE CHANGED. AND WE CAN SHOW THE SENSE IN COURT HELEN INDIVIDUAL WHO HAS BEEN SENTENCED HAS CHANGED AND- FOUR CENTS IN RECONSIDERATION. WHAT THAT'S BEEN DOING INSTEAD OF OUR INSTITUTIONS INMATES ARE SEEKING OUT REHABILITATION LIKE NO OTHER TIME- THEY ARE. ACTIVELY TRYING TO REESTABLISH FAMILY TIES AND ACTIVELY TRYING TO BETTER THEMSELVES NOT ONLY FOR THEMSELVES BUT FOR THE COMMUNITY THEY LIVE IN IN THESE PRISONS IN THESE PRESENT THEM PARTICULAR THESE PRISON YARDS. SO IT'S BEEN VERY BENEFICIAL- BEYOND THE CRITICAL ITEMS THAT- BUT I SPOKEN ABOUT I THINK CORRECTION OF THE HOLD THE POPULATION REDUCTION CAN BE ATTRIBUTED. TO THE PARTNERSHIP THAT WE'VE ESTABLISHED OF THE COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS. PROGRAMS LIKE DOT PROGRAMS THAT WE'VE NEVER HAD IN THE PAST PROGRAMS THAT HAVE COMEIN THAT- TEN FIFTEEN YEARS AGO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT OF AS- OR HOW HOW COULD THAT. BENEFIT ANY IN MAY BUT IF YOU COME INTO AN INSTITUTION TAKE A LOOK AT SOME OF THESE PROGRAMS PARTICULAR THE DOG PROGRAM. IN VARIOUS INSTITUTIONS THIS CHANGE THE DYNAMIC OF WHAT WE HAVE FOUND IS THAT IMAGE OR SEEKING A PURPOSE A GREATER PURPOSE. AND WHAT GREATER PURPOSE IS TO. PUT A LIVING AN ENTITY A DOG IN FRONT OF THEM TO TRAIN THEM TO HELP PEOPLE BE ON THEMSELVES EVERYTHING FROM VETERANS SUFFERING FROM PTSD AND OTHER NEEDS. DISABLED DISABLED INDIVIDUALS TO TRAIN THEM TO ASSIST OF THE FIFTH AND DOGS. AND THEN ALSO JUST THE MORE STANDARD RESCUE. THE INMATES OF POURED BACK INTO THESE- INTO THESE DOGS BUT- THAT DOES THIS CHANGE THE ATMOSPHERE IN THE PRISONS- THOSE ARE JUST A FEW EXAMPLES- I DO WANT TO SAY THAT THROUGH THE AMBITIOUS- POPULATION REDUCTION THAT WE'VE UNDERTAKEN WE HAVE. TAKEN DOWN OUR PRISON FROM ON THE STATE. WHICH IS A GOOD THING- WERE NOW IN LINE TO BRING DOWN- THE LAST OF OUR TO PRIVATE FOR PROFIT PRISONS- BY APRIL OF NEXT MONTH. BUT THEN WE ALSO HAVE. A PLAN TO BRING DOWN OUR- MODIFIED COMMUNITY CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES WHICH REALLY CONTRACTED WITH- SHAFTER TAFT AND MAKE FOR AN DELANO. AND THOSE ARE GOING TO BE COMING DOWN IN THE LATEST ONE IN TWENTY TWENTY TWO. SO FOR THAT A BELIEVER IN A BETTER PLACE AND WHAT THAT'S ALLOWED US TO DO IS UTILIZE SPACE BETTER- TO PUT LESSEN MASON AREAS THAT WE- THAT WE USED TO HAVE OVERCROWDED BUT- I THINK THE USE OF OUR GYMS THE MORE USE OF SPACE AND LESS INMATES ILLUSTRIS ON STAFF IS PROBABLY ONE OF THE BEST THINGS WE CAN DO LASTLY A CLOSE WITH- TO SUSTAIN THESE CHANGES AND REDUCTION JUST NOT JUST FOR THE SAKE OF BRINGING INMATES DOWN A POPULATION DOWN. PROP FIFTY SEVEN WAS REALLY PUT THEIR TO ENHANCE INMATES ACCESS TO REHABILITATION AND HAVE THEM SEE CUT REHABILITATION IN WAYS I NEVER DID IN THE PAST. I KNOW WHEN WE TALK ABOUT PROFIT THE SEVEN IT REALLY FROM A PERSPECTIVE OF. BLOWING UP PRISON NUMBERS GETTING PEOPLE OUT FASTER. BUT THE I THINK THE POPULATION REDUCTION AS A PERTAINS TO FIFTY SEVEN I THINK THAT'S- A BENEFIT. TO THE INMATE SEEKING REHABILITATION AND SEEKING TO BETTER THEMSELVES. AND I THINK THAT'S WHERE WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT CREDITS AND INCENTIVES. IMAGE TO PARTICIPATE IN PROGRAMS NOT JUST TO GET OUT OF PRISON NOT JUST TO GET OUT SOONER. THEY HAVE TO GET OUT AT THE RIGHT TIME WITH THE RIGHT DOSAGE AND THEY'VE KERN THESE THINGS PARTICIPATING IN COURSES IN ACHIEVING- MASTERY OF SKILLS IN CERTAIN PROGRAM SO- I'M VERY LOOKING FORWARD TO- THAN WHAT SOME OF THESE THAT REDUCTION TO BRING US- AND I KNOW SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT COME UP ABOUT. YOU KNOW WHICH PRISON NEXT AND I'M SURE THIS CAN BE A VERY. YOU KNOW POINT A TOPIC IN MY- OTHERS A BRING UP IT IS BUT I CAN TELL YOU THAT. THESE AREN'T EASY TASK TO BRING. STATE OWNED PRISONS DOWN IS NOT AN EASY THING TO DO- BECAUSE- ALL POPULATIONS AREN'T CREATED THE SAME AND THEY'RE NOT HOUSE THE SAME OR THEY'RE NOT TREATED THE SAME THERE ARE THESE- SUB SUB POPULATIONS THAT HAVE NEEDS- THAT ARE REQUIRED IN CERTAIN INSTITUTIONS AND THERE'S ALSO THE STAFF TO CONSIDER AS WE BRING THEM DOWN- AND ANY. YOU KNOW ANY CONSIDERATION OR ANY- VOCALIZATION OF THIS PRISON ON THIS DAY IT THERE'S UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES BY COMING OUT TOO EARLY BY SAYING SOMETHING LIKE THAT SO I WILL END WITH THAT AND- I WELCOME ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU HAVE. ABILITY TO. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR CAITLYN O'NEILL WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE I'M GONNA BE SPEAKING FROM A HANDOUT CALLED EFFECTIVELY MANAGING STATE PRISON INFRASTRUCTURE I BELIEVE YOU HAVE- IN THE SERGEANTS HAVE EXTRA COPIES. I TURNING TO PAGE ONE THE STATE PRISON SYSTEM HAS SIGNIFICANT INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS A RECENT STUDY FOUND OF THE STATE'S TWELVE OLDEST PRESENCE RECOMMENDED OVER ELEVEN BILLION DOLLARS IN- INFRASTRUCTURE UPGRADES THAT THE- FOR THE STATE TO MAKE IN ORDER TO CONTINUE TO OPERATE THOSE PRISONS IN THE LONG TERM- OTHER INFORMATION SUGGESTS THAT THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT NEEDS AT THIS. THE OTHER TWENTY TWO STATE OWNED PRISONS THAT AGAIN COULD PUT IT IN THE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS. TURNING A PAGE TO PAGE TWO. THE SEE A FIGURE HERE SHOWING THAT THE STATE INMATE POPULATION HAS BEEN DECLINING IN RECENT YEARS AND IS PROJECTED TO CONTINUE TO DECLINE THIRD JUNE TWENTY TWENTY FOUR. AND RECENT DECLINES HAVE. BEEN ACCOMMODATED BY REMOVING INMATES FROM. OUT OF STATE CONTRACT FACILITIES FOLLOWED BY- IN STATE CONTRACT FACILITIES. THAT ARE PRIVATELY OPERATED IN HOUSE MALE INMATES AS REQUIRED BY STATE LAW- THE DEPARTMENT IS GOING ITS- ANTICIPATES THAT THE REMAINDER OF THOSE. I OF INMATES IN THOSE FACILITIES WILL BE REMOVED BY APRIL THIS OF THIS SPRING. AFTER THAT- THE STATE CAN CHOOSE AS TO WHETHER TO ACCOMMODATE THAT A FURTHER DECLINES- BY REMOVING INMATES FROM PUBLICLY OPERATED CONTRACTS LOCATED IN CALIFORNIA. OR PROCEED TO CLOSING PRISONS. AND WE ESTIMATE THAT GIVEN THIS THE MAGNITUDE OF THE PROJECT TO DECLINE AFTER AGAIN AFTER THE FINAL- INMATES ARE REMOVED FROM THE PRIVATE FACILITIES HOUSING MALES. THERE WILL BE ABOUT A TWENTY TWO SIXTY TWO HUNDRED AND MAY DECLINE WITH BY JUNE TWENTY TWENTY FOUR WHICH IS ENOUGH TO CLOSE TO PRESENCE. AND MOVING ON TO PAGE FOUR I WE JUST RELEASED A REPORT ON FRIDAY WHICH I AND I HAVE COPIES OF HERE IF ANYONE WOULD LIKE TO TAKE ONE WITH THEM- AND I'M GOING TO JUST GIVE SOME VERY BRIEF- TAKE AWAYS FROM THE REPORT AS IT PERTAINS TO THIS CONVERSATION BUT I'M CERTAINLY HAPPY TO- ANSWER QUESTIONS ON THE REPORTER TALK AT A LATER DATE IN MORE DETAIL. ABOUT THAT IF I'D BE HELPFUL- BUT OUR REPORT- ESSENTIALLY- RECOMMENDS A ROADMAP TO GUIDE THE LEGISLATURE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF A PLAN TO STRATEGICALLY MANAGE PRESENT INFRASTRUCTURE- IN LIGHT OF THE POOR CONDITION OF STATE FACILITIES AND THE POSSIBILITY OF PRISON CLOSURE IN THE NEAR TERM. AND WE RECOMMEND- THAT THE LEGISLATURE DIRECT CD START TO CLOSE TO PRISONS IN THE NEAR TERM. THIS WOULD ALLOW THE STATE TO AVOID- INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS AT THOSE TWO PRESENTS AND THEN CONCENTRATE- REMAINING EFFORTS AND RESOURCES AT THE OTHER PRISONS THAT ARE AND SIGNIFICANT NEED OF REPAIR. WHICH WE THINK WOULD REDUCE- REDUCE THE REST OF STATUS SUED FOR THE RESULTING ACT THE CONDITIONS RESULTING FROM POOR INFRASTRUCTURE- CLOSING TO PRISONS WOULD ALSO RESULT IN ABOUT A HUNDRED MILLION AN ANNUAL OPERATIONAL SAVINGS RELATIVE TO THE ADMINISTRATION'S PLAN TO. REMOVE AN FOR INMATES FROM PUBLIC CONTRACTS AND THEN CLOSE ONE AT PRESENT WE ALSO RECOMMEND REQUIRING CDC ARE TO DEVELOP A STRATEGY TO IMPROVE INFRASTRUCTURE AT THE REMAINING PRESENCE- AND THAT WOULD INVOLVE. THEM SUBMITTING A LIST OF THE SIGNIFICANT HIGH PRIORITY INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS THEY THINK ARE NECESSARY OVER THE NEXT AT TEN YEARS AS WELL AS- SUBMITTING A- RECOMMENDED PROJECT PRIORITY ORDER AND TIMELINE- AND- THAT- PRIORITIZES ISSUES THAT THREATEN THE IN MAINE STAFF WELL BEING AS WELL AS- CONSIDERS OPPORTUNITIES TO REDUCE COSTS IN A NUMBER OF WAYS. BETWEEN THE DETAILS- FURTHER IN OUR REPORT. AND FINALLY ON PAGE FIVE I'M JUST GOING TO GOING TO A BIT MORE DETAIL ON THE STEPS RELATED TO PRISON CLOSURE GIVEN THAT'S A KEY TOPIC FOR TODAY- WE- WE GET. RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE DIRECT THE DEPARTMENT TO IDENTIFY A RANK PRISONS FOR CLOSURE- BASED ON KEY CARD KEY CRITERIA WE THINK THE STATE SHOULD CONSIDER CLOSING PRISONS WITH HIGH OPERATIONAL COSTS- INDOOR COSTLY INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS RELATIVE TO THE AMOUNT OF IN MAKE CAPACITY THAT THEY GIVE TO THE SYSTEM. AND THE STATE WE- WE WOULD ALSO WANT TO LIKELY AVOID THE CLOSING- OR BE COGNIZANT OF THE IMPACTS OF CLOSING PRISONS WITH. SPECIALIZED MISSIONS FOR EXAMPLE PRISONS THAT ARE SPECIALIZED IN PROVIDING THE HIGHEST LEVELS OF HEALTH CARE TO INMATES. I'M AND THEN THIRD THE- PRISONS THAT HAVE DIFFICULTY PROVIDING ADEQUATE SERVICES DUE TO THEIR LOCATION FOR EXAMPLE- DIFFICULTY IN RECRUITING RECRUITING STAFF- DUE TO THEIR LOCATION- COULD BE PART TIED FOR CLOSURE OVER OTHER PERSONS THAT OPERATE MORE EFFECTIVELY. AND ANY OF THE LEGISLATURE COULD ALSO IDENTIFY OTHER CRITERIA THAT IT WOULD LIKE TO BE CONSIDERED- IN NOT RANKING. AND THEN WE RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE DIRECT THE DEPARTMENT TO PROVIDE A DETAILED PRISON CLOSURE PLAN BY JANUARY OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE- THAT WOULD OUTLINED IT ESSENTIALLY DRESS THE KEY LOGISTICS- THAT WOULD NEED TO. HAPPEN TO- FACILITATE A PRISON CLOSURES. I'M AND THEN AS A PART OF THAT PLAN- AND CLOSURE PROCESS THE STATE WILL LIKELY BARGAIN WITH UNIONS TOO AND WITH THE UNIONS REPRESENT EMPLOYEES WHO WORK AT THE PRESENTS- TO MINIMIZE THE EFFECTS ON THE WORK FORCE AND DAY TO DAY OPERATION SO WE WOULD WANT TO SEE THAT- THOSE. AT UNION THE PRODUCT OF THOSE UNION NEGOTIATIONS ALSO SUBMITTED WITH THE PLAN SO THEY COULD BE CONSIDERED TOGETHER. AND I'D BE HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME THANK YOU. THANK YOU ROBERT NELSON PART OF FINANCE. AS NOTED BY SECRETARY DEUS IF THE CURRENT DOWNWARD POPULATION TREND CONTINUES WE WILL. CONTINUE ELIMINATING CONTRACT FACILITIES THROUGH TWENTY TWENTY TWO. AND EVALUATE OPTIONS TO CLOSE IN A STATE PRISON BY TWENTY TWENTY FOUR. I LIKE TO KNOW THAT ABILITY TO CLOSE FACILITIES DEPENDS ON THE CURRENT POPULATION TREND HOLDING I'D LIKE TO NOTE. THAT A NUMBER OF FACTORS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED BEFORE SELECTING WHICH PRESENT A CLOSE SUCH AS WE HAVE MADE SUBSTANTIAL INVESTMENTS IN RECENT YEARS IN BUILDING CAPACITY. FOR REHABILITATIVE SERVICES TO INMATES IN STATE PRISONS. ANY OF OUR REHABILITATION IS EXPECTED TO BE FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY THREE MILLION. IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE. COMPARED TO THREE MILLION IN TWENTY TWELVE THIRTEEN. OUR STATE PRISON PRISONS OFFER A VARIETY OF PROGRAMMING SUCH AS FACE TO FACE COLLEGE AN INTEGRATED SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT PROGRAM. BUT THE PRISON TOO EARLY COULD IMPEDE THE DEPARTMENT'S ABILITY TO MEET THE NEEDS OF ITS INMATE POPULATION FROM US FISCAL STANDPOINT CLOSER TO PRISON BEFORE A CONTRACT FACILITIES IS NOT CLEAR CUT. IS NOT COMPARING HIS SON APPLES TO APPLES COMPARISON IN GENERAL THE INMATES WE SEND CONTRACTORS CITIES ARE CHEAPER TO HOUSE THE NOSE IN STATE PRISONS FOR EXAMPLE. ARE CONTRA BEDS ARE LOWER SECURITY. IT FINALLY CLOSING THE STATE PRISON BEFORE CONDUCT CONTRADICT AS SILLY AS WOULD DIFFER CONSIDERABLE SAVINGS A SHORT TERM WHILE KEEPING THOSE CONTRA BEDS OPEN- WE HAVE THE ANSWER QUESTIONS CONCLUDES MY COMMENTS. THANK YOU THANK. THANK YOU DONALD SPECTOR FROM THE PRISON LAW OFFICE. FIRST OF ALL I AGREE WITH- SECRETARY DENIES THAT THE POPULATION AS- GONE WAY DOWN A SINCE THE COURT ORDERED THE POPULATION DECREASED AND AS A RESULT THINGS ARE MUCH BETTER THAN THEY WERE AND THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT THERE HAS BEEN MORE REHABILITATIVE OPPORTUNITIES FOR PEOPLE IN PRISON THAN THERE EVER HAVE BEEN BEFORE SO WE CAN GRADUALLY THE ADMINISTRATION AND MISTER DE AS AN AS FOLKS FOR DOING ALL THAT- SECONDLY- PLEASE KEEP IN MIND THAT. CALIFORNIA'S PRISONS ARE STILL VERY OVERCROWDED- BY THEIR OWN ESTIMATE SYSTEM WIDE THERE AT ABOUT A HUNDRED AND FOR SOME PRISONS ARE AT A HUNDRED AND 60% OF WHAT THEY WERE DESIGNED FOR AND MANY ARE IN THE HUNDRED AND FIFTY TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY RANGE. SO THE DON'T WANT TO COMMIT THE HAVE THE IMP. THE WE'RE OP. AFTER A SYSTEM WHICH IS AN OVERCROWDED IT IS VERY OVERCROWDED AND SQUAT. IT CAUSES A LOT OF LOGISTICAL PROBLEMS. IN OPERATING THAT SYSTEM- MANY OF WHICH MISTER DE AS HESTER ARE. FIGURE OUT HOW TO DEAL WITH- AS FAR AS THE- CLOSURE OF THE PRISONS US IS CONCERNED- WE AGREE WITH THE LA OWES RECOMMENDATIONS I THINK THEY THOUGHT FALL AND I THINK THEY SET OUT ON. A PROCESS BY WHICH THAT CAN HAPPEN. IN TERMS OF THE POPULATION REDUCTION THIS ISN'T A IT'S BEEN PRESENTED AS SOMETHING PASSIVE. IN THE SENSE OF WELL IF THE POPULATION TREND CONTINUES HOWEVER THE STATE HAS CONTROL OVER THE POPULATION IN TWO WAYS ONE. IF THROUGH THE PAROLE BOARD- AND SECONDLY THROUGH PROPOSITION FIFTY SEVEN THE SECRETARY OF CORRECTIONS HAS THE AUTHORITY TO AWARD CREDITS- AND THE AMOUNT OF CREDITS SO- IN MY OPINION THE DEPARTMENT HAS THE ABILITY. TO MAINTAIN A DECREASE IN POPULATION THROUGH THOSE TWO MECHANISMS THE THIRD- GOING TO THE INFRASTRUCTURE AS THE LA OO AND THAT YOUR STAFF HAVE DEMONSTRATED. THERE'S AN ALMOST A TWENTY BILLION DOLLAR NEED FOR- INFRASTRUCTURE REPAIR BASED ON THE- THE ELEVEN BILLION DOLLARS THAT IDENTIFIED BY KITCHELL AND THEN ANOTHER EIGHT SOMETHING- IDENTIFIED BY THE CDC I'M SELF. SO THESE TO INFRASTRUCTURE REPAIRS ARE SORELY NEEDED BECAUSE THE PRISONS ARE REALLY CRUMBLING- SOME OF THEM. AND THEY MAKE LIFE FOR MY CLIENTS THE PEOPLE WHO ARE INCARCERATED IN INTOLERABLE IN SOME RESPECTS I WANT TO READ TO YOU. A COUPLE OF SENTENCES FROM A COURT ORDER THAT WE RECENTLY OBTAINED LAST YEAR ABOUT THE FACT THAT IN ONE OF THE PRISONS THE ROOF WAS FAILING- THE JUDGE WROTE IT IS A SHAME THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND DEPARTMENT CORRECTIONS AND REBUILD. HAVE A LOT OF THE FACILITY A DINING BEFORE ALL TO SEE JUST DISTRICT. IT IN SPAIN IT'S A PICTURE OF A CORRECTION. CIVIL WHEN I GO. CAN SELL BOTH ITS LOCATION IN THE NATION AND THE STATE OF SUCH FINANCIAL ABUNDANCE AND ADVANCE LEGAL STANDARDS FOR THE HABITABILITY OF REAL PROPERTY AND CLEANLINESS OF FOOD SERVICES ESTABLISHMENTS AS YOU REAL RECALL. THE FACT OF THAT THE ROOF FAILED MEANT THAT- THERE WERE- FECES FROM BIRDS FALLING ON TO THE DINING HALL- WATER DAMAGE WAS- POLLUTING OF THE DINING HALL AND THE LIKE SO THESE INFRASTRUCTURE REPAIRS- NEED TO BE. PUT ON A VERY- URGENT LEVEL MISTER DE AS HAS BEEN GRACIOUS ENOUGH TO ALLOW US TO- TO GO INSPECT THE PRISONS. FROM THE KITCHEN REPORT TO- PROVIDE OUR INPUT ON WHAT A LIST OF PRIORITIES SHOULD BE BUT I URGE THE COMMITTEE TO- MAKE THAT A PRIORITY AS WELL AND BOTH OF. I WOULD HOPE THAT SOME OF THE FUNDS COULD BE PUT IN THE MAYOR THE VISOR THE OR THE JUNE BUDGET SO THAT THEY CAN GET STARTED IN SOME OF THE MOST CRITICAL PLACES. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. OKAY ANY QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS. WE'LL HAVE TO YOU HAVE WITH US WAS TO TING OR COMPARED BUT EACH YEAR THANKS FOR BEING HERE. WITH THE STONE. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER SECRETARY FOR BEING HERE AND TAKING US THROUGH THE SAID I THINK JUST THE- A FEW COMMENTS AND THEN TRYING TO MAKE SURE WERE HEADED IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. I THINK A COUPLE YEARS AGO. THIS COMMITTEE WAS WAS. ASKING FOR THE GOVERNOR'S THAT COME FORWARD IS HOW HOW DO WE START TO TALK ABOUT CLOSING PRISONS. AND IF YOU ARE ABLE TO COME UP WITH A PLAN THEN WE WOULD. I THINK EVERYBODY IS IT SHOULD BE A LITTLE FEARFUL OF US COMING UP WITH A PLAN SINCE YOU'RE THE EXPERT SAID. IN HOW IT GETS DONE. SO I'M A LITTLE BIT CONCERNED AT AT THE RELUCTANCE TO MOVE FORWARD BECAUSE I THINK WE DO HAVE A SITUATION WHERE WE SPENT. BUILDING CAPACITY IN SENDING MORE MORE PEOPLE THE PRESIDENT OF THE LAST NUMBER OF DECADES THROUGH AND A NUMBER OF. INITIATIVES THAT. HAVE NOT KEPT OUR COMMUNITY SAFER BUT HAVE JUST PUT MORE MORE PEOPLE TO PRESENT IN WITHOUT THE REHABILITATION. WHEN THEY COME OUT THEY'RE ACTUALLY ADDING. TO THE LACK OF SAFETY IN OUR COMMUNITIES WE- HAVE NOT BEEN WORKING WITH THE PUBLIC SAFETY GOAL BUT JUST THIS NOTION OF. LOCKING PEOPLE UP FOR THE SAKE OF LACKEY BLACK. SO UNLESS WE'RE ON A REAL TRAJECTORY. TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF BEDS IN THERE AND REDUCE THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE. THAT WE ARE SENDING TO PRESENT IT AND M. SINCE. THEN WE'RE WE'RE CONSTANTLY BE CHASING. MONEY AFTER- AFTER. MONEY REALLY AND IN THESE PROGRAMS I THINK FOR US TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THE INVESTMENTS. IN INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS WE'RE ALWAYS GOING TO BE PUSHING UP AGAINST THIS FEAR THAT WHAT WE'RE REALLY DOING IS FACILITATING. MAINTAINING THAT SPACE MAINTAINING CERTAIN CAPACITIES WITHOUT THAT GETTING TO OUR REHABILITATIVE GOALS. AND REALLY OUR PRISON REDUCTION GOALS REDUCING THE THAT NUMBER OF. OF PEOPLE WHO ARE HOUSE ESPECIALLY HOUSED UNNECESSARILY OR WERE COULD BE HELD IN DIFFERENT PLACES. SO I THINK THAT'S WHEN THINGS THAT THAT NEEDS TO BE LOOKED AT HERE. AND I'M VERY MUCH LOOKING FORWARD TO THE ABILITY TO COME FOR THE PLANET I THINK THE PLAN ALSO IF WE'RE GONNA DO THIS AMOUNT OF WORK. IF YOU'RE GONNA DO THIS ABOUT WORK BECAUSE I KNOW THAT THAT COULD BE DO A LOT OF IT. I THINK THIS COULD ALSO SET UP CRITERIA FOR LOOKING EVEN FURTHER AHEAD OF HOW WE CONTINUE TO KEEP MAIN GOALS IN THE FOREFRONT. ALSO HOW WE SCORE TO IDENTIFY ATTRIBUTES MILESTONES CHANGES THAT CONTINUE TO ALLOW FOR. CLOSING MORE PRISONS AS THEIR- AS BECOMES NECESSARY. AND ONE THING THAT HAS COME UP SO THAT THE LA- WAS TALKING ABOUT THE- THE PUBLIC. CONTRACTED BEDS AND I THINK IN YOUR STATEMENT. WE WERE LOOKING TO CLOSE THOSE PUBLIC CONTRACTED BUT STAY OUT. SO I GUESS THERE'S A THERE'S A BIT OF A DICHOTOMY THERE. GIVEN THAT THOSE BEDS ARE CHEAPER. AND. RESPECT ON. THAT THIS. VERSE MAIN. SOME OF THE AND I'M NOT WEIGHING IN WITH ANY PARTICULAR. BENT ON WHICH IS THE RIGHT DIRECTION BUT JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND BETTER. THE DECISION MAKING IF WE'RE GONNA HAVE. GOING TO BE CLOSING PRISONS BUT MAINTAINING SOME FLEXIBILITY. WHAT WITH THE TRADE OFFS FOR THE PURPOSE STANDPOINT TO MAKE THAT DECISION. I THINK THE A ONE THE ONE THE STATE GOT INTO THE AGREEMENTS WITH. BEGINNING WITH OUT OF STATE THE BEGINNING WITH AND STATE BEDS CONTRACTING WITH EITHER. PROFIT PRIVATE FOR PROFIT. FOR COMMUNITY CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES WHICH ARE RUN BY LOCAL COMMUNITIES. WE NEED THOSE BEDS THE OVERCROWDING SITUATION IN OUR STATE PRISONS PROPER WITHIN THE THIRTY FIVE INSTITUTIONS. AND NOW READ A POINT TO WHERE WE ARE DOWN O OUR LAST- BUT I THINK WHEN WE LOOK AT THESE INSTITUTIONS- WHERE THEY'RE AT THESE FACILITIES FIRST OF ALL HAVE TO THANK THEM FOR THE SERVICE OF THE BEEN PROVIDING BECAUSE THEY HAVE BEEN. ALLOWING US PUT INMATES IN THOSE BEDS THAT HAVE A VERY LOW IF NO MEDICAL NEEDS VERY LOW TO NO MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS INMATES THAT ARE ON THE LOWER LEVEL OF THE SECURITY SPECTRUM- SO THE HOUSE IN THESE FACILITIES BUT ONCE AT THE A AND THAT DOES CONCERN ME WITH THESE FACILITIES IS A- VIGIL THAT WILL BE GOING HOME- SOONER THAN OTHER. BECAUSE OF POINTS IN THE SERVER AND I BELIEVE WITHIN THE STATE PRISONS THEMSELVES OF FUNDING THAT WE RECEIVED FROM THIS BODY HERE- THROUGH THE REHABILITATIVE MRS BROWN'S APPLE. THAT SERVICE THAT GET IN SOME PARTS DOESN'T IS BETTER THAN WHAT THE AT THESE COMMIT CORRECTION FOR. NOT TO SAY THAT GOOD PARTNERS AND ME A NEED I BELIEVE ARE ENTRY. AND SERVE AND ACCESS TO THOSE PROGRAMS ARE BETTER- WE HAVE- FACE TO FACE COLLEGE LIKE I SAID EARLIER WE HAVE BETTER VOCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES AND TRAINING INSIDE OF OUR STATE PRISONS WE HAVE THE ABILITY FOR INMATES TO LEARN TRAITS THAT ARE PRISON INDUSTRY AUTHORITY. THAT THEY CANNOT GET AND THESE COMMUNITY CORRECTION FACILITIES. NOW WHAT. YOU KNOW ONCE MEANT THAT I READ YOU KNOW THOUGHT WILL. THE EFFORTS FOR THESE OKAY. ARE BETTER THAN SOME OF OUR STATE PRISONS. I HAVEN'T SEEN- A REPORT FOR THAT I DON'T YOU I WOULDN'T WANT TO CHALLENGE THAT. BUT I WOULD SAY THAT THE REASON WE HAVE SERVICES PROVIDED BY THESE FACILITIES- WE DO THEM BETTER IN STATE PRISON- AND I WOULD CHAMPION I WOULD. LOOKAT- TO STICK WITH THE PLAN THAT'S BEEN PUT FORTH BY THE GOVERNOR TO BRING THEM DOWN- AND IN TURN I KNOW THAT THE QUESTIONS WILL WHICH ONE NEXT WHAT COMES NEXT AND I'VE HAD. DISCUSSIONS WITH. PEOPLE ON THIS COMMITTEE HERE- AND THEY'RE VERY GOOD QUESTIONS. THE TWELVE PRISONERS STUDY THAT WE- THAT WE SET FORTH AND WITH- KITCHELL AS MISTER SPECTER MENTIONED THE CONTRACTOR WHO. DID THE STUDY ON THE TWELVE OLDEST PRISONS. WE HAVE A- WE WORKED WITH THEM AND WE HAVE RECEIVED FINAL REPORTS IN THE LAST TWELVE NOW WE'RE THE NEXT STEP. IS TO WORK WITH THE SAME CONTRACTOR TO- TO SEEK A PRIORITIZATION- WITH THEM. TO TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT. WHAT THE INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS ARE IN THOSE LOCATIONS BASED ON THE POPULATIONS THAT DO EXIST WITH THEM. AND ALSO TO COME UP WITH A PLAN IN REVIEWING DEVELOP- AN ORDER IN WHICH THEY WERE TO COME DOWN IN THE END IT WILL BE A DISCUSSION WITH THE ADMINISTRATION ON WHICH ONES. WHICH ORDER THEY WERE TO COME DOWN CLOSE IN A PRISON IS NOT AN EASY THING- WE HAVE SUB SUB SETS A POPULATIONS THAT. REQUIRE HIGH NEEDS- WE ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT- SOME OF THE INSTITUTIONS ARE IN LOCATION LIKE SAID BEFORE. WE DO HAVE A HARD TIME RECRUITING. AND WOULD HAVE A HARD TIME RETAINING PEOPLE IN SOME PLACES AND THE CONCERN. IF WE GET AHEAD OF A TIME THAT WHEN WE'RE READY TO ACTUALLY ANNOUNCE AN INSTITUTION. IT WOULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE ABILITY TO GET PEOPLE TO EITHER STAY AT THE FACILITY OR TO RECRUIT TO THAT FACILITY WITH SENATOR COULD IMPACT OUR REHABILITATIVE EFFORTS AT THAT FACILITY. RIGHT AND THEN AND I DO UNDERSTAND THAT WHICH IS WHY COMING WITH A PLAN AND- AND RECOGNIZE THE APPLICATIONS. I THINK YOUR POINT IS WELL TAKEN ABOUT. IT'S BILL TATE OF SERVICES THAT NEEDS TO. REMAIN THE FOCUS AND ACTUALLY BE AN ENHANCED FOCUS AS WE MOVE THROUGH AND IT SOUNDS LIKE IN SOME OF THE CONTRACT THE PUBLIC CONTACT FACILITIES WHICH WE NEED TO GET. COMPLETELY OUT OF THE BUSINESS OF DEALING WITH A PRIVATE CONTRACTOR FACILITIES ABSOLUTELY THAT'S THAT'S I THINK LONG BEEN A OF A BIT OF A STATE IN OUR SYSTEM AND HOW WE- SHOULD BE CONTEMPLATING OURSELVES. BUT WITH THOSE FACILITIES. THOSE THOSE INMATES THAT THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE. IN CUSTODY THERE ON THAT CONTRACT BASIS. PROBABLY ARE ONES THAT ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE CONSIDERED FOR. RELEASE WAR PUBLIC SHOULD HAVE BEEN COULD HAVE BEEN HELD T THE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL AND NOT NECESSARILY BE. THE BURDEN BECAUSE I THINK IT'S AS WE GET TO. A SYSTEM WITH REDUCED CAPACITY AND REDUCE THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING THERE THOSE ARE SOMETIMES GOING TO BE THE MOST DIFFICULT REALLY TO SERVE AND SO I THINK THE PROGRAMMING AND INFRASTRUCTURE IT WILL DEFINITELY NEED TO REFLECT THAT- BUT IS WERE MAKING DECISIONS AND TRY TO INVEST AGAIN IN THESE FACILITIES AND MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE MEETING HELPING TO MEET YOUR INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS AS AS SOME OF THOSE FACILITIES ARE CRUMBLING. I THINK WE NEED TO BE MAKING SURE WHICH IS WHY THIS COMMITTEES ASKED FOR. TO THAT WE KNOW THAT WHAT WE'RE INVESTING IN WITH REHABILITATIVE SERVICES. THAT WE'RE GETTING DATA ON HOW EFFECTIVE THOSE SERVICES ARE FOR. BIRD REDUCING RECIDIVISM. THAT WE ARE KEEPING AN EYE ON AND- WHERE THE POPULATION IS AND WHAT THOSE SPECIAL NEEDS ARE SO THAT AS WERE MAKING THOSE DECISIONS ABOUT. REHABILITATING INFRASTRUCTURE OR MAKING SURE THAT THAT WE'VE GOT PROGRAMMING REALLY ACROSS THE SYSTEM THAT WE UNDERSTAND WHAT ALL OF THOSE THOSE IMPLICATIONS ARE. THAT'S WHY COMING UP WITH A WITH STANDARDS IN COMING UP WITH THE PLANNING DOCUMENTS. AND REALLY BE ABLE SAID THAT STANDARD AND IN LOOKING TO PUT A CLOSE WONDERFUL GOING CLOSE TO. MOVING PEOPLE OUTOF THE CONTRACT TO FACILITIES YOU KNOW THAT THAT'S ALL FINE BUT- KEEPING IN MIND CRITERIA FOR EVEN NEXT STEPS THE YOU KNOW HOW DO WE KEEP LOOKING AT. IMPROVING AND TESTING OUR GOALS ALONG THAT WAY BECAUSE THEN THAT MAKES IT A LOT EASIER FOR THIS COMMITTEE TO BE ABLE TO DO THE INVESTMENT IN THE EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE THAT YOU NEED VI&lt;c.cyan&gt; ROOFS VIçT OTHERS. SO&lt;/c&gt; THAT WE'RE NOT CONTINUE INTO TO THROW GO GOOD MONEY AFTER JUST CHASING MORE BEDS KEEPING CAPACITIES UP WHEN I THINK WE ALL HAVE THE ABILITY TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE REDUCING THOSE COULD THE ACTUAL NEED. FOR SOME OF THESE FACILITIES OVER TIME SO THAT'S WHY. I'D LIKE TO GET THERE IN AND NOT. I THINK THERE'S LESS. SPECULATION ABOUT WHAT IF THIS BALLOT MEASURE PASSES WITHOUT ABOUT MEASURE PASSES I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD BE. SHY ABOUTPUTTING TOGETHER AN AGGRESSIVE PLAN THINGS MAY CHANGE LONGTIME BUT THERE'S A LOT OF CONTROL WITHIN THE SYSTEM. TO AFFECT THE POPULATION AND WHO'S WHERE AND WHY AND FOR PUSHING MORE FOR REHABILITATIVE SERVICES AND I WOULD HOPE WE COULD GET TO THE POINT WHERE THIS COMMITTEE IS LOOKING AT. EVEN POTENTIAL EVEN THOUGH OUR GOAL IS TO REDUCE THE OVERALL PRISON COST. IF WE'RE LOOKING FOR ADDITIONAL MONEY BECAUSE OF EFFECTIVE. PROGRAMMING ASSISTING PEOPLE WHO ARE INSIDE AND HELPING THEM WITH WITH THEIR NEEDS SO THAT WHEN THEY COME OUT WORK SEE RECORD SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCING RECIDIVISM RATES I THINK THAT'S THE VALUE. THAT WE ALL SHARE HERE FOR AS LONG AS WE CAN. MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE ON THE SAME PAGE COMMUNICATING IN IN UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT PLAN IS. ANYONE ELSE MR LACKEY YOUR QUESTION YEAH. JUST A JUST A COUPLE COMMENTS- FIRST OF ALL WE HAVE THIRTY FOUR PRISONS OR SOMETHING CLOSE TO THAT RIGHT CORRECT. FELT THE STATE AND EACH ONE OF THOSE PRESENTS A VERY UNIQUE- THEY HAVE UNIQUE ENVIRONMENTS AS WELL AS POPULATIONS. AND THAT THE CRITERIA THAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THE NEEDS TO BE ESTABLISHED ON DETERMINING. AND EVERYBODY WOULD AGREE THAT- REDUCING. THE PRISON POPULATION IS A LAUDABLE GOAL AND SOME WE- HOPE THAT THE TREND CONTINUES TOWARD. BUT I WILL TELL YOU RIGHT NOW THAT THERE ARE NUMBER OF PRISONS THAT ARE AND VERY VERY. A DEPLORABLE CONDITION- I'M GOING TO MENTION ONE OF THEM. PLEASANT VALLEY PRISON- I HAPPEN TO KNOW. FOR A FACT THAT WHEN IT RAINS. IT'S DISGUSTING AND IT'S JUST UNIMAGINABLE THAT THAT HAS NOT BEEN TAKING CARE OF OVER THIS LONG PERIOD OF TIME AND- I THINK THOSE ARE THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT AND FUNDING- BECAUSE THE CONDITION NOT ONLY IMPACTS THE IN MAY BUT ALSO EMPLOYEES AND I THINK THAT. THIS PRESENT REDUCTION SHOULD ALSO CONSIDER COMMUNITIES IN WHICH THE PRISON EXISTS- WE SHOULD ALSO AGREED TO CONSIDER EMPLOYMENT IMPACTS- BY THE EMPLOYEES AND HOW THEIR LIVES ARE GOING TO BE IMPACTED BY THIS DECISION MAKING- AND AS WELL AS AS THE INMATE I MEAN AS YOU WERE JUST INDICATING IT DOESN'T LIKE WE HAVE A HIGH VACANCY RATES IN AND OUR PRISONS IF I UNDERSTOOD THERE STILL POPULATION CONCERNS AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. MAYBE EXACERBATING THAT CIRCUMSTANCE AND I THINK THAT WE JUST NEED TO BE CAUTIOUS. AND I THINK THAT SOME OF THESE OTHER CONCERNS. ARE DESERVING OF OUR ATTENTION- AND I DON'T KNOW WHY WE HAVEN'T DONE A BETTER JOB OF. OF ADDRESSING SOME THESE INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS BECAUSE THEY'RE REALLY REALLY QUITE STARK. AND IN MANY THE CONDITION SOME WAY WORSE THAN OTHERS BUT- THE ONE I JUST MENTIONED AS- IT'S UNIMAGINABLE THAT THAT SITUATION STILL EXISTED SO. I WOULD JUST HOPE THAT WOULD BE WE WOULD BE VERY VERY CAUTIOUS AND THE WAY THAT WE MOVE TOWARD THIS. VERY IT LAUDABLE GOAL BUT NONETHELESS I THINK WE NEED TO BE FOCUSED ON. THE TOTAL PACKAGE AND NOT JUST ONE ASPECT. APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS ASSEMBLY MEMBER- AYE AYE I'M VERY FAMILIAR WITH THE PLEASANT VALLEY SITUATION I KNOW THAT THE WARDEN PERSONALLY- THE ROOF ISSUES AT THAT INSTITUTIONS AND OTHERS LIKE IT. THEY STEM FROM. I THINK- RAMPING BACK UP FROM THE LEAN TIMES DURING THE TOUGH BUDGET YEARS- THAT CALIFORNIA FACED- AND JUST THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE THAT DID OCCUR IN. IN ATTEMPTING TO TRY AND GET FUNDING FOR THESE LOCATIONS AND TOUGH YEARS WERE. WRONG PLAN NOW THAT PLACE- PLEASANT VALLEY IS FUNDED TO GET THOSE ROOFS FIX THEIR- THEY ARE IN A BETTER CONDITION BUT I DO HAVE OTHERS. THAT WERE BUILT IN SIMILAR TIMES- I HAVE SOME BURKE PRISONS BUILT IN THE- EIGHTEEN HUNDREDS WITH RUSSO BETTER CONDITION MAYBE IT'S A DIFFERENT DESIGN OR DIFFERENT TIMES WHO KNOWS. BUT I'M WELL AWARE THAT THE IMPACT IT HAS ON THE STAFF. IT'S TOUGH ENOUGH TO GO TO WORK IN A PRISON JUST TO DO THE THINGS THAT ARE. WITHIN THE INTO CATIONS WHERE YOU HAVE. FOR THEM. THIS IS. A TIMBER BUT THE- WHAT THE FUNDING THAT WE DID RECEIVE THE NINETY. IN PRE A ON GOING. BY MONEY TO CONTINUE WITH THOSE REPAIRS- AND THE MONEY THAT WE ARE ASKING FOR IN THIS BUDGET IS TO GET HEAD. OF OTHERS OF THE SITUATION SO WE DON'T HAVE A PLEASANT VALLEY. NINE FIVE MAKE ONE QUICK COMMENT SURE THAT. AS I UNDERSTOOD- I'M NOT A FINANCIAL PERSON SO BUT I'VE READ IT FROM EITHER- MISS KIM'S REPORTER THE LA- REPORT. THE CAPITAL OUTLAY BUDGET OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSING IS A HALF A BILLION DOLLARS APPROXIMATELY. AND AS YOU JUST HEARD. THE NEED IS AROUND TWENTY BILLION DOLLARS FOR AND SO. I WOULD WELL HE'S- A SECRETARY IS CORRECT THAT THEY HAVE SOME MONEY- WE'VE BEEN ADVOCATING THIS FOR MANY YEARS I THINK THEY NEED A- MUCH LARGER INFUSION AND I. HOPE THE BUDGET COMMITTEE WOULD SEE FIT TO INCREASE THAT AMOUNT. ANY OF THE COME QUESTIONS MISTER CHANG. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I THINK. APPRECIATE BOTH OF MY COLLEAGUE. MICHAEL THESE COMMENTS AS WELL INSPECTORS COMMENTS I THINK THE- THE CHALLENGE WITH THE- PRIORITIZATION- OF THE CAPITAL- HAS BEEN THE FACT THAT WE- HAVEN'T RECEIVED A PRIORITIZATION FROM THE DEPARTMENT. SO THAT'S BEEN VERY CHALLENGING SO IT'S A IT'S I THINK. YEAH MY COLLEAGUE- FROM MOMMY. PALM DALES COMMENTS ARE ARE RIGHT ON THE MONEY BET BUT PART OF THE CHALLENGES IS UNLESS WE HAVE A PLAN ON WHICH FACILITIES GO FIRST AND WHICH ONES ARE IN THE- WORST URBAN. SIGNED OF DISREPAIR AS WELL AS WHAT THE PRIORITIES IT'S SORT OF HARD FOR US BECAUSE ALL WE GET IS A LIST OF THE PEACE. AND ALL WE CAN TAKE IS ABOUT I THINK YOUR POINT IS VERY EXTRAORDINARILY WILL TAKE THEM YEAH NOT NOT TO TAKE ANYTHING AWAY FROM YOUR COMMENT. ON SO DOUBTS THE SECRETARY THE OBVIOUS QUESTION TO WHICH ONE NEXT AND WHEN WE KNOW. I THINK- THAT ATTORNEY ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND UNITED SPOKE AT LENGTH ON THIS ON THIS ISSUE. AND OUR DISCUSSIONS- THERE WELL TAKEN AND THEY AREN'T THEY ARE DISMISSED AT ALL BUT I KNOW THE ONE QUESTION THAT CONTINUALLY COMES UP IS WHICH ONE PLAN- AND AS I SAID EARLIER. IT'S NOT AS EASY- BUT I RECOGNIZE ASKING FOR MONEY AND YOU APPROVING IT JUST AS AN ATHLETE I RECKON IT'S NOT EASY TO DO EITHER BECAUSE I THINK ONE POINT THAT I TOOK FROM MY CONVERSATIONS WILL ASSIST TAKE THE- CRC QUESTION. ABOUT WE'RE SEEKING SIX MILLION DOLLARS TO REPAIR WALLS FLOORING SINKS AND FOR MEDICAL DISTRIBUTION ARIA. BUT THAT'S THE ONE THAT'S CURRENTLY ALWAYS BEEN UP FOR DISCUSSION AND YOU KNOW HAS HAS BEEN NOT HAS BEEN DOCUMENTED THE ONE THAT'LL CLOSE- I CAN TELL YOU THAT WAS A SIX MILLION DOLLAR REQUESTS BUT FOR NEW BUILDING IT WOULD'VE BEEN A SEVENTY MILLION DOLLAR QUESTION WE WOULDN'T REQUEST SEVENTY MILLION BECAUSE OF THESE FACTORS LIKE TO DISCUSS- BECAUSE- IT COULD BE ONE. OR IT COULD BE ONE OF THE CENTRAL VALLEY COULD. BUT I THINK WE HAVE TO GET TO A POINT TO WERE ONCE WE'RE BACK FROM THE IN STATE COMMITTEE CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES. AS WE SEE THE POPULATION STE- CONTINUE TO DROP BUT THEN ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT WERE NOT A STATIC STATE THINGS CAN HAPPEN. TO MISTER SPECTER'S POINT. HE COULD FILE A LAWSUIT AND COULD STORE SEND A PROPER CRY BUT BUT BUT- HE- MORE REASON. TO A PLAN. RIGHT I MEAN YOU YOU YOU JUST HEARD ARE MY CALLING ASKED VERY SPOKE ABOUT A PARTICULAR. AND IN A ROOF. COM I WISH I COULD I WISH WE COULD ALL SAY WELL THAT. THAT FACILITY RANKS NUMBER THREE OR NUMBER THIRTY AND THESE ARE THE REASONS WHY THAT ROOF HASN'T BEEN. REPAIR RIGHT I THINK THAT WOULD BE. READ THAT THAT WOULD HAVE A LEAST SOME RESERVE VERSES ON. WE'RE WORKING ON OUR GUESS THAT THAT'S WHY I'M HERE THAT WERE WE'RE WORKING THAT THIS THE IS ON. FOURTH YOUR HAVING. THIS KIND HERE. YOUR ARE SET SECRETARY HAVE IN THIS. TOPIC HERE IN THAT BEEN THE CONTINUES SPOTS I. DO GIVE YOU. TO SORT OF WORK WAR AND ALL THINK ONLY PERSON. LEFT TO ME IS A- AND I JUST WANNA PLUG GOVERNOR. I MAKING A VERY BRAVE. ANNOUNCEMENT OF TALKING ABOUT A PRISON CLOSURE THE BUDGET. IN HIS BUDGET ANNOUNCED AND WE THINK THAT'S GREAT AS I BY COLLEGE SANTA CRUZ MENTION. THE SYSTEM THAT BEEN ABOUT A CHAMPION FOR FROM A NUMBER YEARS AND COMMITTEE. BUT CLEAN AUTO. KEEP HIS GONNA BE FRANKLY LAST PATIENT AND I AM AND I THINK THE CAN IS THE LACK CAN ON THIS BUT ISSUE LAWS A MINUTE PROPOSAL T CLOSE NORCO. AND IT DOESN'T APPEAR THE TOP HAS EVEN EVEN THOUGH IT WAS THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL THIS DOES APPEAR THAT THAT THE DEPARTMENTS MOVED. ANYWHERE NEAR THAT IS THAT FAIR TO SAY. I THINK WE HAVE TO A DENTURE QUESTION NO WE AREN'T ANY CLOSER TO CLOSE THE NORCO WE'RE NOT STEPS EVEN EVEN THOUGH THAT WAS IN A MISTER STRICT VERSION PROPOSAL. THAT BUT HASN'T I WOULD SAY THAT EVERY IS TO THAT WE HAVE OF THE THIRTY FOR INSTITUTIONS THAT THAT WE ARE NOT THE CONTRACTOR SO THAT CAL CITY. THAT WE RECOGNIZE LIKE I SAID IN THE BEGINNING THESE ARE. THESE ARE PEOPLE IN THESE LOCATIONS ABSOLUTE AND THE FUNDING THAT I'M SEEKING. TO IMPROVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE WHETHER BE REUSS COUNTERS HEALTH CARE MENTAL HEALTH REHABILITATION SPACE. IT'S BECAUSE I HAVE PEOPLE IN THERE. TODAY AND WE ARE WAITING FOR THE COMPLETION OF THE TWELVE PRESENT STUDY SO I CAN. HAVE THE- CHURCHILL'S ASSESSMENT OF THE PRIORITIZATION. SO WE CAN GO OVER WITH THEM THEN EVENTUALLY WE CAN HAVE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE IN OCTOBER. STATED EARLIER EVEN BEYOND THE TWELVE THE RE. THAT THERE'S EIGHT EIGHT. EARLY IN THE OF INSTRUCTION THE THEIR- SO EVEN OUTSIDE THE TWELVE GOT A LOOK AT OTHERS AND PINNACLE TWENTY SIXTY SAID DOES US. THE CRITERIA THAT WE DO LOOK AT AND WHAT WE'RE SUPPOSED FACTORY IN INCOME TO THESE. NO NO I NOW UNDERSTAND HAVE ENOUGH ACCOUNT. OF AT THE TOLL PLANS I KNOW WITH UPS AND BUT- MY FEEL IS YOU. THIRTY FOUR THIS FACILITY HE GOT FOUR VERY. WARDENS WHO. YOU KNOW PER IF YOU IF YOU GOT A MALL A CALL OR SEND A MORE THE COULD. GO THROUGH ALL VARIOUS I'D- THAT ARE PRETTY SIGNIFICANT. SO I GUESS I GUESS I'M JUST TRYING UNDER. WHY THAT HOW OCCURRED ALE WHY TO PER HASN'T IT UPON ITSELF TO DO. A MUCH CLEARER ASSESSMENT. AND AGAIN LIKE I SAID YOU KNOW THE WITH THE WORDS NO IT'S ON IN THE U. YEAH I DON'T THINK YOU'LL GET A HAVE TALKED ENOUGH FOR A YOU KNOW ALL OF THEM. THAT I'M THERE'S NOT ONE. IN THERE FOR THAT THEY REALLY KNOW ABOUT. SO IDEA THAT WE TO GO HIGH SOME PALED MONEY. TO CAN ASSESS OF WHAT FOUR OVER KNOWS. TODAY SEEMS LOW BIT OUGHT. AND SO HAS ACT. OCCURRED WE HAVE COME OF WAR ON A BASS. AND I CAN TELL YOU A WARDEN THE CHAMP IN THEIR INSTITUTION HI THAT THEY THEY THEY BELIEVE IN WHAT THEY DO THEY NEED FUNDING TO FIX THE THINGS THAT THEY BELIEVE ARE IMPACTING. THE INMATES IN THE STAFF AND- THE WELL BEING OF EVERYONE THAT WALKS IN THOSE GATES ON A DAILY BASIS- THEY WOULD GIVE ME THEIR PRIORITIZATION BUT IT WOULD BE IN THE FORM OF BECAUSE THEY WANT TO STAY. IN THE CURRENT CATALOG OF CORRECTIONS BEYOND FIVE YEARS WILBERFORCE THEM BUT THAT'S- BUT THAT'S WHERE. YOUR JOB AT. RIGHT I MEAN THERE JOB IS TO. LET WHAT THEIR NEEDS IS YOUR JOB IS TO. ASSESS MY MORE GLOBAL POINT OF VIEW WHERE THE STATE PARTIES ARE RIGHT I MEAN DO YOU KNOW ALL YOU'RE ASKING THEM IS I ASSUME. WHEN YOU'RE- THE BCP'S AND YOU'VE IDENTIFIED WHERE YOU'D LIKE THIS YEAR'S BCP'S TO GO YOU GET THE LESS FROM THE WARDENS THAT. IS THAT FAIR WHAT DO THEY HAVE NOT HAVE ANY INPUT IN THE WE GET WE GET REQUESTS THROUGHOUT THE YEAR AND THEY ARE PUT IN TWO FOUR FACILITIES MAINTENANCE THE COMPUTER FACILITIES MAINTENANCE DIVISION. FOR THE PRIORITIZE THE RIGHT FACILITIES MAINTENANCE DIVISION THAT COME UP FROM THE WARDEN'S. AND HOW DOES THE DEPARTMENT PRIORITIZE THAT LAST. I THINK WE LOOK AT A NUMBER ONE THE HEALTH AND SAFETY- AND THEN- WE TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT THE CURRENT IN NEED IS FOR THAT PARTICULAR INSTITUTION WHETHER IT BE A HEALTH CARE FACILITY OR TO DON'S CASE- MISTER SPECTER'S ABOUT THE CHAU SITUATION. THAT GOT BUMPED UP. SO THAT ONE HAD TO GET FIXED SO IT'S ITEMS LIKE THAT THERE'S SOME OF THEM ARE EMERGENT. A SOE HOME LONG THIS IS SHOWBIZ TODAY ALL FACT THAT THE READY EMPLOY TO. WHICH PROPOSALS RISE TO THE TOP OR NOT WHAT WHY ISN'T THAT JUST WHY DON'T YOU JUST PUT A PLAN TOGETHER WITH THAT SAME CARD HERE THAT YOU ALREADY EMPLOYMENT. WE SOME REMEMBER WE ARE. WE ARE ATTEMPTING TO. AT WE GET AS DONE IT'S COME. BUT AFTER WE GET THAT PART. DONE WE WILL BE TO CAN. TO ROBUST DISK. ABOUT WHICH ORDER THEY'LL DOWN BY. THERE THERE IS NOTHING STATIC ABOUT CORRECTIONS WHAT WILL BE GOOD TO WILL BE GOOD THE DAY. IN A MY THE COULD CHANGE. THERE'S NOTHING STELLAR ABOUT LIFE. A SO DOESN'T MEAN. THAT I IF YOU CAME ME AS A I DON'T HAVE A PLAN FOR MY LIFE AGO WILL THEN WHERE YOU GO. RIGHT IN QUITE FOR THE PART WHERE TO PUT GO IT'S GREAT THAT DEPARTMENT HAS A MAY ST. WHAT IS THE PLAN TO EXECUTE. THE ON THAT MISSION. I THINK AND SO THE JUST ME FINISH SO GET AGAIN COM. THE DEPARTMENT IS EVERY DAY. PRIORITIZE AND- THE CAPITAL NEEDS. OF THE THIRTY FOUR FACILITIES SEPARATISM YEAH. SO WHY IS THE DEPARTMENT ACTUALLY PUTTING THAT INTO PAPER. AND ACTUALLY ARTICULATING THAT FOR OUR VANTAGE POINT VALUES VANTAGE POINT FOR THE PUBLIC SPANISH POINT. WHY IS NOT PUBLIC INFORMATION. I THINK WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR THE ORDER OF INSTITUTIONS OF THE GOING TO COME DOWN. BUT ALSO ACROSS VARIOUS THE COULD BUT BASS THE COUNTRY THE CARTER STOP. THOU PROCESS NOT PUBLIC CLINIC. IS NOT PART COMING. YEAR WE THE BOOK OF TOTAL REASONABLE QUESTION WE GOT A- SAID HEY YOU GOT A LEAKY WISER. MY VERY WE. I DON'T THINK YOU CAN ABLE TO ANSWER WHY. ON WHY WE HAVEN'T FIX THAT OR WHY WE'RE REQUESTING FUN YOU KNOW WHY YOU IN FOR THREE. WE ARE FIX THE OFFICE OF YES. YES. WE GOT FUNDED FOR REPAIRS HAVE BEEN DONE TO ARE COMPLETED AND OTHERS I HAVE TO CHECK WHERE THEY ARE PURCHASE A BUT THEY THEY MAY BE COMPLETE. WE ARE REAP PLEASANT VALLEY. BUT I WHAT WE ALSO KNOW FOR BECAUSE OUR OTHER THE PROOF HAVEN'T BEEN FIXED. THERE MAY ROOF PROJECT RIGHT CURRENTLY PLACE RIGHT AND THERE'S A- AT LEAST FROM I COULDN'T REALLY ARE. WHY THE IS. GOOD FOR SEDUCTIVE EFFECTS. I IT'S BASED ON THE NEED THAT COME WHAT HAVE FOUND IS THE LEAN TIMES OF THE BUDGET THAT WAS NO. PLAN TO YOU KNOW SICK ON GOING FOR JUST REPAIR THEY WERE ALWAYS OTHER EVEN ISSUE THAT WERE COMING UP RIPARIAN. BUT BUT I GUESS IS THAT MEAN THAT IS. WHAT THOSE GET SUBMITTED IS THAT. YOU HAVE WE HAVE WITH SOME HELP OR GUIDANCE. THE ANSWERS. LET YOU LOOK OVER MUCH WHAT I DON'T I DON'T I DON'T WHAT I APOLOGIZE THE. AND JUSTICE. HI CLOSER TO. IF I. HAVE A TWO YEAR ROLLOUT SO THIS BUDGET INCLUDES FUNDING FOR DESIGN AND THEN THE NEXT YEAR INCLUDES MONEY FOR CONSTRUCTION AND SO OVER THE NEXT ABOUT TEN YEARS WE HAVE THE SEVEN PHASES WERE WE'VE ACTUALLY IDENTIFIED WHICH OF THE RIVER PLACES WILL BE DONE OVER THAT PERIOD OF TIME. AND HOW DO YOU HOW DO THEY GET PRIORITIZE. I'M AS THE SECRETARY MENTIONED I THINK IT HAS A LOT TO DO WITH KIND OF THE STEP AT THE STATUS OF THAT INFRASTRUCTURE SO WHEN WE'VE GOT ROOF WHERE WE'VE GOT LEAKY BUT IT'S- THERE'S A PUBLIC SAFETY CONCERN THOSE ARE GENERALLY RISING TO THE TOP OF THE LAST. BUT I WOULD ALSO MENTION THAT THE- THE DEPARTMENT HAS AN ONGOING BASS LINE A SPECIAL REPAIR FUNDING AND SO WHILE WE'VE GOT THIS SEVEN YEAR ROLL OUT THERE'S ALSO THE SPECIAL PERFORMANCE OF WE'VE GOT OTHER ISSUES THAT COME UP AT SOME OF THESE INSTITUTIONS THAT MAY RATE RISE TO THE LEVEL. RATHER THAN WAITING FOR THE NEW BUDGET PROCESS WE'VE GOT THAT ONGOING BASICALLY FUNDING THE COULD ALSO BE CONTRIBUTE TO THOSE PERSONS ARTS TO THOSE REFER PLACEMENTS ONE THICKER MY FEELING IS LOOK WE HAVE THESE HOME. SEPARATE FUNDS FOR A MERGER FOR MANY OF THE DEPARTMENTS FOR MANY OF THE ISSUES AND CAL CAL FIRE COMES TO MIND- IN TERMS OF SORT OF APPROPRIATIONS WERE MONEY GETS APPROPRIATE WE ARE OUT OF SESSION BECAUSE OF EMERGENCIES AND WE'VE- OBVIOUSLY HAD A QUITE A FEW CAL FIRE EMERGENCIES OVER THE LAST HERE- WHAT WHAT I WOULD SAY IS THE DEPARTMENT COULD GET GREATER FLEXIBILITY. AND FREEDOM IF. I AM PUT FORWARD. THERE WAS A METHOD. AND A PIRATE STATED TO STATION PUT FORWARD. THAT WE CAN ALL AGREE ON SO THEN. WE WOULD HAVE TO TRY TO DECIPHER ON THE PC PEAS ARE COMING FORWARD AS WELL AS- HAVE TO NIT PICK OVER EVERY SINGLE ITEM. OM I THINK GOING BACK TO- I THINK MIX MISTER SPECTER'S EARLIER POINT AND ONE OF THE REASONS WHY- THE COMMITTEE HAS BEEN I THINK RED ISN'T TOO- JUST WRITE THE CHECK FOR- IN ALL THE REPAIRS IS BECAUSE- WE KEEP WAITING FOR. WHICH WHICH POTENTIAL FACILITIES MAY BE UP FOR CLOSURE SUCH I GUESS ONE QUESTION IS INSTRUCTORS CAN YOU GUARANTEE TO THE COMMITTEE THAT YOU WON'T BE BRINGING FORWARD ANY BCP'S OF ANY FACILITIES THAT WILL BE PROPOSED FOR CLOSURE BECAUSE THE LAST THING WE'D LIKE TO DO IS PUT A NEW ROOF ON A FACILITY THEY GO TEAR DOWN TWO YEARS LATER OR HAVE A NEW ROOF ON OFFICIALLY THAT EMPTY AGAINST YOUR MEDICAL TERM DOWN. I CANNOT I CANNOT GIVE I CAN GIVE I CANNOT GUARANTEE THAT TO THE COMMITTEE RIGHT SO UNTIL YOU CAN GUARANTEE THAT THAT IT'S MAKES IT VERY DIFFICULT TO APPROPRIATE THESE RESOURCES ON YEAH BECAUSE WHY WHY WOULD I YOU KNOW GIVE YOU MONEY TO FIX THE CAR AND THEN SAID TO THE JUNK YARD THE NEXT DAY. AND WE GOT LONG LONG LIST OF CARS SOME THAT NEED TO BE FIXED. I UNDERSTAND AND IT'S- I JUST WANT TO LET THE COMMITTEE KNOW THAT THERE IS NO INTENT TO TRYING TO SAY HI. WE'RE NOT GOING TO CLOSE THE STATE PRISON BECAUSE THAT IN THE END THAT'S OUR GOAL. THAT IS ALL OF OUR GOAL TO REHABILITATE TO LOWER PRISON POPULATION TO MAKE SAFER COMMUNITIES. BUT WHEN IT COMES TO THE QUESTION OF CLOTHES IN A PARTICULAR PRISON- THE IT'S NOT AS EASY AS ONE WOULD THINK AND WE ARE HAVING INTERNET DISCUSSIONS THAT THEY ARE TRYING TO STAY WITHIN THE SPIRIT OF TWENTY SIXTY SEVEN AND- CREATING A LIST BASED ON INFORMATION FROM THE TOLL PLAZA STUDIES AND OTHERS. THAT WE KNOW IT'S COMPLICATED EVEN MORE REASON TO HAVE A PLAN. I DON'T I DON'T THINK. YOU'VE HEARD ANYBODY UP HERE SAYING THAT A STOCK COMPANY ABSOLUTELY BELIEVE IT'S COMPLICATED BUT- EVEN MORE REASON TO HAVE CRITERIA AND EVEN MORE REASON TO HAVE A PLAN. NO ONE'S ARGUING THE EIGHTEEN MONTH TIME FRAME. BUT I THINK WHAT WE WHAT WE ARE ARGUING AS WE DON'T WANT TO BE WASTING. VERY PRECIOUS TAXPAYER RESOURCES. BECAUSE YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND. SOLD THAT'S NOT OKAY MOVIE WE HAVE MANY OTHER THINGS THAT WE NEED TO SPEND THE MONEY WE HAVE HE A PRESCHOOL FACILITY GOT KINDERGARTEN FACILITIES WE HAVE. ON RECREATIONAL CELLS WITH HEALTH FACILITIES THIS IS NOT THE ONLY GAME IN THIS BUDGET SO SUGGESTS JUST SWITCH THE TOPIC HAS COME BACK TO FINANCE FOR SECOND THAT'S ONE TO CLARIFY WHAT ON. FINANCE IT ON THE ABILITY XIN WHICH IS. YOU MENTION THAT THE INCREASES SPENDING WITH ABOUT THREE HUNDRED MILLION TO ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED MILLION OF CAP OVER WHAT TIME FRAME THE WAS. SO EVER EXPECT TO SPEND FIVE OR FIFTY THREE MILLION IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE. I COMPARED TO THREE MILLION IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE THIRTEEN. OKAY THE END CAN. CAN YOU TALK ABOUT THE- RECIDIVISM RATE- IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWELVE ON WARES TODAY I DON'T HAVE INFORMATION ON ME BUT I CAN. SO YOU SO YOU INCREASE SPENDING TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR ORDER PROPOSED TO DO IT IN ABOUT TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. WHAT WHAT IMPROVEMENTS IN RECIDIVISM HAVE OCCURRED TO THAT SPEND ANOTHER ARMY BUT CAN DEFINITELY GET ABOUT BACK TO WHEN I. WE'LL TALK ABOUT THE SECRETARY HAD PARTY NO THE TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS IS WORKING. I WOULD SAY THAT THE MOST RECENT RECIDIVISM NUMBERS ARE THERE THEY STAYED PRETTY MUCH THE SAME FORTY SIX FOUR SIX POINT OF THINGS FOR SIX POINT FOUR. I THINK THAT'S IT FOR SIX THIRSTING FOR CUT TWO HUNDRED MILLION UNDER SAID ABOUT AND THAT THEY COULD THESE REPORT NUMBERS FROM THREE YEARS PRIOR. TO THAT SO WE'RE DEALING WITH THOSE NUMBERS AS AS A COURT COMES OUT WE ARE. STILL WAITING TO SEE WHAT THESE INVESTMENTS CUT PAN OUT IN THE NEXT COHORTOF RECIDIVISM NUMBERS BECAUSE WE'RE DEALING THREE YEARS PASS AS WE DEVELOP THE COHORT NUMBERS FOR RECIDIVISM YES WHAT WE'RE HERE LAST YEAR WE HAD THIS. SUMMER CONVERSATION AROUND RECIDIVISM SO- WHAT THE QUESTIONS I HAD ASKED IS SORT OF. HOW TO TRACK THE PROGRESS BY IN MAY SO WANTED TO JUST HEAR AFTER TWELVE MONTHS. HAVE MADE ANY PROGRESS ON BEING ABLE TO TRACK THE PROGRESS PER IN MAY. IF WE LOOK AT THE GAINS OF PROPOSITION FIFTY SEVEN. INMATES WHO HAVE EARNED CREDITS BASED ON THESE EXPANDED REHAB OPPORTUNITIES THAT'S THE ANSWER MY QUESTION THE QUESTION IS VERY SPECIFIC HAVE YOU. MADE GAINS IN TRACKING THE PROGRESS BY IMAGE IF I'M AN INMATE. AND I AM TAKING COURSES. HAVE YOU MAY PROGRESS IN TRACKING THEM TRACKING THAT INFORMATION BECAUSE A YEAR AGO. WE GOT A SOME RESPONSE TO THE FACILITIES QUESTION WHICH IS WE WERE WORKING ON SO I JUST WENT THROUGH YOUR DIVISION OF REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMS WE HAVE. INCREASED OUR TRACKING AND ARE OUT COMES ON IT AND THAT'S WHAT THIS COMMITTEE WHAT MEANS OF THE LAST COMMITTEE THAT WE'RE IN FRONT OF WE DID WE DIDN'T HAVE A- A ROBUST TRACKING SYSTEM WE HAVE NOW ESTABLISHMENT OF THE DIVISION OF REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMS TO SHOW THE GAINS IN THE VARIOUS INVESTMENTS IN REHABILITATION SO WAS I SAID HE PULLED UP MY RECORD WILL THIS. BEFORE JOHN DOES RECORD. I THINK IT DEPENDS ON WHAT YOU KNOW WHERE THAT INDIVIDUAL IS IN THERE WHAT WHAT WILL TAKE FROM WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT IT BEFORE YOU DON'T HAVE ANY INFORMATION AS TO WHAT INFORMATION WILL POP UP WHEN YOU SAY I THINK WE'RE IN FOR ESTABLISHMENT OF THE REHABILITATIVE CASE PLANTS OF THE CORRECTIONAL COUNSELING SERVICE PLUGIN INMATES INTO THESE PROGRAMS THAT THAT OTHERWISE WOULDN'T BEEN ABLE TO PARTICIPATE BECAUSE OF THE PRISON REDUCTIONS. WERE ABLE TO GET INTO PROGRAMS- AND IT MORE AND MORE RAPID MANNER- ANY BUT I THINK WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR IS THE POINT IN TIME GAME FOR EVERY SINGLE INMATE I WOULD SAY THAT- THE GAINS THAT WE'RE SEEING THAT IN THE INSTITUTIONS INMATES ARE RECEIVING MORE PROGRAM AND THEY HAVE IN THE PAST THERE IN COLLEGES AND VOCATIONAL PROGRAMS THEY ARE. WELL I'M NOT I'M NOT GONNA ARGUE THAT BUT- WISHES CAN YOU PROVE IT. CAN YOU PROVE. I BELIEVE WE CAN HELP THROUGH THESE RECIDIVISM REPORT NUMBERS WHICH I CAN HAVE A REAL BILL RIGHT RIGHT PROGRAMS ALL ABOARD THE CALL ME ALL OF YOU KNOW WHAT I'M LOOKING AT A NUMBER OF MY COLLEAGUES AND WE ALL HAVE DIFFERENT LICENSES AND DIFFERENT DEGREES AND WE KIND OF TAKE DIFFERENT COURSES TO ACCOMPLISH DIFFERENT THINGS. YOU KNOW. MY COLLEAGUE FROM- PONDO HE KEPT YOU CAN DO BETTER- HOW THE PATROL OFFICER WITHOUT. YOU KNOW ACCOMPLISHMENT TAKING THEIR CERTAIN COURSES HAVE INSTRUMENT OF TRAINING. SO IS THAT BEING TRACKED ON AN INDIVIDUAL LEVEL BY HIM. WE TRACK LITERACY GAINES WE TRASK COLLEGE COMPLETIONS WE TRACK VOCATIONAL COMPLETIONS WE TRACK. OF COURSE WE TRACK PARTICIPATION REBUILT IN A PROGRAMS WHICH LEAD TO MORE INCREASE CREDITS EARNED BY INMATES WE TRACKED THE MILESTONE COMPLETIONS- THAT- GAIN BY INMATES WHO MASTERY OF THE SUBJECT SOLD SO LIMITED YES BOX SO YOU TRACK WHEN SOMEONE PASSES A MILESTONE. YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHERE THEY ARE TO ACHIEVING THE MOUSE DOES NOT FOR CHARACTERIZATION I GUESS I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT WHAT WHAT THAT MORE JUST LIKE JUST LIKE IF YOU GO T COLLEGE. DO YOU KNOW FOR LACK OF A BETTER WORD YOU THINK SO GRADUATE SCHOOL. YOU KNOW WHEN SOMEONE'S GRADUATE HIGH SCHOOL YOU DON'T KNOW HOW MANY CLASSES THERE SHORTCOMING CLASSES IT TAKE. TO GET TO. I THINK I JUST WANTED TO SEND IT IS THAT CORRECT OR NOT. I MEAN SOME OF. THE DEPARTMENT HAS THAT INFORMATION AVAILABLE IT'S JUST WE DON'T HAVE IT ON HAND WHAT I'M- SELECT YOUR GREAT PLAINS TRACKING WHAT IT MEANS COME AND WEATHER AT. YOUR WEATHER AT IN HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA LEVELS YOU KNOW THERE ARE LITERACY RATES. ALL RIGHT SIDE INFORMATION AVAILABLE I THINK WHAT'S BEEN SAYS WE JUST DON'T HAVE IT ON HAND I CAN DEMONSTRATE IT WITH YOU. HELLO I WASN'T ASKING FOR BUT THE YOU HAD LIKE FROM THE COMMITTEE I'M ASKING IF YOU HAD IT A ALL AND- YET YOU HAVE. YES AND- DOES THAT. HELP DRIVE THE ASSIGNMENTS. FOR BY IN MAY. YES BECAUSE BECAUSE WHAT I'VE WHAT I'VE VISITED. I'VE ONLY VISITED FEW OF THE FACILITIES SO AGAIN THIS IS NOT A- BY THE WAY THE SIDE. EFFECTS STUDY OF IT. COME IT SEEMED RATHER THAN PEOPLE BEING ASSIGNED COURSES OR CLASSES ALONG A MORE LINEAR APPROACH TO TELL YOU WHAT IT OR ARE SOMEWHAT LINEAR APPROACH WHICH IS HOW YOU WOULD ASSUME THIS WOULD GO. IT WAS JUST SORT OF LIKE. YOU KNOW FOR LACK OF BETTER WORDS YOU KOW LIKE I'M VISITING SO PEOPLE GOT. WHAT'S GOT PUT IN CHAIRS THE PARTS OF YOUR GREAT LAKES DEVELOPING THIS PRINTER PROGRAMMING FOR COLLEGE FOR JUNIOR COLLEGE AND YOU'LL SEE IT. THE PROPOSAL LATER THIS YEAR IN A COUPLE WEEKS FOR HIGHER ED ON THERE YOU'RE GOING TO GREAT LENGTHS TO COORDINATE THE SUCH A PROGRAM IS MAKING SURE THAT IN THE SECOND MAN HAVE. THE BASIC SKILLS TO DO THOSE COLLEGES- WORKING WITH THE JUNIOR COLLEGES THERE ARE PROVIDING. NINE DEGREES GET THEM OUT I NOTEBOOK GLOBAL LEVEL ALL THIS IS. OCCURRING WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HIS DETAILS MATTER. RIGHT CAN I THINK A I'LL JUST GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE I MEAN THAT THAT THIS IS THIS IS THE BEST WAY TO PUT RIGHT INTO THE JOB IS I HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO VISIT SALINAS VALLEY BECAUSE WE HAD THE ON. INSPECTOR GENERAL HERE LAST YEAR THE LAST TWELVE MONTHS AGO WE HAD A VERY YOU KNOW- A LIVELY HEARING BASED ON THAT FACILITY- AND WHY YOU WOULD BUY YOU WOULD LOOK AT A GLOBAL LEVEL AND SAY OH SALINAS ALWAYS GOT A SHOP CLASS SOARING AUTO BODY CLASS AND THEN THE UP FRONT. I THINK IT WAS. HVAC CLASS THEN YOU HAVE A LAW LIBRARY WHEN YOU HAVE A COMPUTER CLASS AND YOU HAVE A- LIFE SKILLS CLASS. THAT THERE WERE WASN'T. THE CASE BECAUSE NOT. EVERY INMATE AT THE FACILITY COULD TAKE. THOSE CLASSES BECAUSE EACH OF THOSE CLASSROOMS WITH SEGMENTED BY YARD. AND THERE ARE FOUR DIFFERENT YARDS AT THAT. FACILITY IS THE ONLY REALLY ONLY TWENTY FIVE PERCENT. OF THAT I THINK ABOUT FOUR THOUSAND INMATES COULD. ACCESS THE AUTO BODY SHOPS OF MORE GLOBAL PRISON LEVEL YOU CHECKED THE BOX. BUT ONLY 25% OF THE FACILITY PEOPLE THE FACILITY CAN ACTUALLY. TAKE THAT CLASS. I THINK AND A- AND YOUR TOWARD AND WE SPOKE BRIEFLY ABOUT AND I THINK ONE OF THE I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS FROM A ONE DAY VISIT IT DOESN'T PAINT THE GREATER PICTURE OF WHAT IT TAKES TO ASSIGN INMATES TO VARIOUS JOBS PROGRAMS BASED ON WHATEVER FACILITY THAT THEY LIVE ON BECAUSE NOT ALL FACILITIES. HOUSE NOR CAN MEET THE NEEDS OF THAT THE WHOLE FACILITY THE FACILITY YOU VISITED IT'S NOT A SHARED SHARED FACILITY MEANING ONE IN MACON ACCESS ALL THE PROGRAMS IN THAT WHOLE PRISON THERE ARE THOSE TYPES OF PRISONS SALINAS IS THAT IS NOT ONE OF THEM- I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND THE THOUGHT THAT IF AN INMATE ON A YARD- COULD FILL A VACANCY ON DELTA FACILITY. I THINK JUST. FOR CONVERSATION YEAH THAT'S AN EASY THING TO DO BUT THERE ARE CONCERNS THAT THEY MADE ON THAT FACILITY CANNOT FOR HIS OWN SAFETY OR THE SAFETY OF OTHERS PROGRAM ON THAT FACILITY NO THAT'S THE ONLY THAT'S QUESTION AUDITED THE QUESTION IS IF THE INMATES AND DELTA YARD HAVE A LAW LIBRARY HOW COME BUT THEY WANT ACCESS TO THE AUTOBODY SHOP HOW CAN THEY CAN GET ACCESS TO THE ABACHA. I'M I'M NOT UNDER. WHO YOU HAD AUTO BODY SHOP SALINE YARD. YOU KNOW OUR YARD HEY. AND YOU GOT INMATES ON YARD THAT WANNA ACT. THE COURSES ON YOUR DAY THEY CAN'T DO THAT THE FACILITY. IF THERE ARE. FOR WHATEVER CUSTODIAL NEED ARE CONCERNED THAT EXISTS THAT HE CANNOT BE PLACED IN THAT FACILITY THEIR HOUSE THEIR BASE FOR VARIOUS REASONS THERE WILL COME A DAY AND I HOPE THE DAY WILL COME TO WHERE I CAN. HOUSE ALL INMATES TOGETHER. AND MAKING SURE SAME FACILITIES AND THE THERE'S NO RISK OF VIOLENCE OR- FLOOR NO WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT EVEN INTERMINGLING YOUR YOUR MISSED THE POINT AGAIN AGAIN THE THAT THE CHALLENGES THAT YOU HAVE. INDIVIDUAL CLASSROOMS TIED TO INDIVIDUAL YARDS CORRECT. IN SEOUL ONLY 25% OF THE INMATES COULD ACTUALLY TAKE ADVANTAGE. OF THOSE CLASSROOMS 25% OF THE INMATES OF THE WHOLE OF THE WHOLE OF THE WHOLE PRISON YEAH THE WHOLE PRISON SO FROM FACILITIES EIGHT A D. ONLY 25% CAN ACCESS EIGHT YARDS. AT AND FOR THAT REASON I SPOKE ABOUT EARLIER THAT THERE ARE VARIOUS REASONS WHY THEY CANNOT AT THAT FACILITY IS NOT A SHARED. SHARED USE FACILITY. NO I UNDERSTAND THAT BUT I THINK THAT THE CHALLENGES IS THAT. ON. IT DOESN'T APPEAR THAT THE AGAIN AND AGAIN I'M I'M LOOKING A BIG PROPONENT OF REHABILITATION DONE CORRECTLY I THINK WHAT'S CONCERNING IS GOING BACK TO THE DISCUSSION WE JUST HAD A CAPITAL IS THAT THE DEPARTMENT. COM DOESN'T HAVE A SYSTEMIC WAY. OF BEING ABLE TO TRACK THE PROGRESS SO EVEN IF THE AGAIN EVEN F THE RECIDIVIST NUMBERS I YOU KNOW ARE.ARE THE SAME OR EVEN LET'S SAY HIGHER. BUT IF YOU COULD SEE ROGRESS BY INDIVIDUAL YOU WOULD HOPE. THAT AT SOME POINT THOSE NUMBERS WOULD GO DOWN. I THINK THE CHALLENGE IS RIGHT NOW THOSE RECIDIVISM NUMB BUT THAT THAT THAT TRACKING. DOESN'T HAPPEN IN THE LEVEL OF DETAIL THAT YOU WOULD EXPECT WITH THAT SIZABLE INVESTMENT. SO I MEAN IT'S UP TO MAYBE IT'S JUST YOU KNOW WE NEED TO GET TOGETHER AND UNDERSTAND WHAT IS BEING TRACKED AND WHAT'S NOT BUT BASED ON AGAIN YOU KNOW I'VE ONLY VISITED A COUPLE OUR OUR BUDGET TEAM IS VISITED A LOT MORE ON. THERE IS THE- THERE IS NOT THE CORRELATION THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE FROM THE INCREASE IN SPENDING TO THE LEVEL OF TRACKING TO THE LEVEL BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT OFFERING MORE COURSES I THINK YOU ARE FROM OF COURSE. I DON'T THINK IT'S BECAUSE THE COURSES. OUR BAD CONNECTION I DIED I HAVE I HAVE A REASON TO BELIEVE I WAS GIVE THAT WITHOUT THE PROGRAM IS GOOD. OR ARE RELATIVELY SPEAKING YOU KNOW GOOD GOOD IT'S- THAT THE PROGRAMMING IS ADEQUATE TO ACHIEVE THE GOAL. I THINK. A MAJOR PROBLEM IS. WHETHER OR NOT THE INMATES ARE BEING PLACED IN THE RIGHT CLASSES AT THE RIGHT TIME. IN THE RIGHT ORDER TO ACHIEVE THEIR AND CALL. I BELIEVE THE PLANE BEING PLACE AT THE RIGHT TIME AT THE RIGHT PLACE ON THE RIGHT FACILITY. WHAT WAS I'M SORRY WHAT WHAT IS THAT BUT IS THAT WHAT THAT MEANS IS TO ORIGINAL POINT TO WHAT WHY CAN'T AN INMATE ON FACILITY A ACCESS THE CLASSROOM FACILITY DE. THE END MADE UP OCILLA GA HE IS ABLE TO ACCESS THE PROGRAMS ASSIGNED TO HIM AT THAT RIGHT TIME BASED ON HIS REHABILITATIVE NEEDS. ON THAT FACILITY GOD. IN SO IF THAT. INDIVIDUAL NEEDS OTHER THINGS THAT ARE BEING OFFERED AT THAT PARTICULAR YARD THEY JUST AREN'T GETTING THEM. I THINK AT SOME POINT WE SEEK TO SEE IF THERE'S ANY OTHER ALTERNATIVE HOUSING FOR HIM THAT MEET HIS NEED. THAT CAN'T LET THAT'S COMMENSURATE WITH HIS MENTAL HEALTH MEDICAL. SECURITY CONCERNS. MAYBE AT ANOTHER FACILITY WE HAVE OVER WRITTEN. THOUSANDS OF INMATES DOWN. TO LEVELS SO THEY CAN GAIN ACCESS TO THESE PROGRAMS WE HAVE BEGAN WORKING OUTSIDE OF OUR NORMAL OPERATION SECURITY CONCERNS OF AN INMATE HASN'T RECEIVED DISPONER HISTORY BUT YET IT'S STILL TRADITIONALLY HIGHER LEVEL. WE WILL HOUSE AMONG THE FACILITY FOR HIS NEEDS CAN BE MET. SO WE HAVE GONE BEYOND TO THINK DIFFERENTLY TO ADDRESS THE CONCERN THAT YOU HAVE ABOUT THINGS LIKE HOW COME HE CAN'T ACCESS A PROGRAM ON ANOTHER YARD. WE HAVE TO HOUSE MONEY FACILITY THAT'S COMMENSURATE WITH HIS CURRENT NEEDS. AS TO NOT. PUT IN THIS SITUATION WAS BAD FOR HIM OR HER. RIGHT BUILT THAT IS THE ULTIMATE PRIORITY AGAIN IS THE. THE PROTECTION OF HARM THIS INDIVIDUAL MAY OR MAY NOT COSTS RELATIVE TO THE PERSON'S REHABILITATION. I THINK THAT'S ALL OF OUR CONCERN I THINK THIS SHOULD BE EVERYONE'S CONCERN YEAH. BUT BUT I GUESS. MY CONCERN ABOUT THIS PARTICULAR ITEM IS WE'VE INVESTED TWO HUNDRED MORE ADDITIONAL DOLLARS I THINK THIS COMMITTEE- PREVIOUS GOVERNOR THIS GOVERNOR HAVE KIND OF STEPPED UP AND ON THEIR PART AND SAID HEY YOU GOT BASICALLY ALMOST DOUBLE THE AMOUNT OF REHABILITATION FUNDING THAT. THAT TOM YOU HAD FROM BEFORE. IN THERE THE REASON YOU KNOW I'M I'M SORT OF THE LABOR THIS POINT IS THIS TO ME IS THAT THE KEY TO THE SUCCESS OF THE DEPARTMENT. IS WHETHER THE DEPARTMENT REALLY HOUSE AND ABILITY TO IMPROVE SOME INDIVIDUALS LIKE. RIGHT IS HE YOUR ARE YOU JUST WERE HOUSING SOME INDIVIDUAL IN TAKEN TIME OFF THEIR LIFE OR IT IS ACTUALLY THE GOAL TO. IMPROVE THEIR LIFE. THAT WHEN THEY COME FOR HOWEVER LONG THEY COME FOR THAT THEIR LIFE IS IMPROVED. AND I KNOW IT SOUNDS- PERHAPS POLLYANNA SHORT LITTLE BASS PROVISIONAL- BUT ALL SPEND IT A DIFFERENT WAY I MEAN I WILL SAY YOU'VE YOU'VE RECEIVED. THE MONEY TO NOW IMPROVE THESE INDIVIDUALS BLOCKS. ADD. YOUR IT'S NOT CLEAR WHAT THE DEPARTMENTS. BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN DOING SO. I BELIEVE THE INVESTMENTS BY THIS LEGISLATURE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAVE IMPROVED THE LIVES OF INMATES I BELIEVE THEY HAVE A HAS IMPROVED THE OUTLOOK ON. WHAT THE POST INCARCERATION LOOKS LIKE. THAT HAS IMPROVE THEIR OPPORTUNITIES IN FRONT OF PAROLE BOARDS- WE HAVE SEEN GRANTS AND PAROLES LABORAL DATES LIKE WE VIA BUT I NEVER WITNESSES A- AS A PRISON YOU KNOW RANK AND FILE PERSON. AND THAT'S TO THESE INVESTMENTS. I'VE SEEN THE GAINES AND- THE POST RELEASE WITH OUR COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATION PARTNERS THAT ARE OUT THERE. TO THE POINT TO WERE INMATES- FORMALLY INCARCERATED TO HAVE LIVED EXPERIENCE COME BACK. TO POUR BACK INTO THE IN MY POPULATIONS BECAUSE OF THESE INVESTMENTS SO YES I DO SEE A BENEFIT OF IT AND I DO BELIEVE WE'RE TRACKING IT WELL AND I KNOW THEY'LL BE SOME FOLLOW UP WITH YOU I'M SURE OR THIS COMMITTEE. SORRY FINANCE YEAH I JUST WANNA SAY- THE INVESTMENTS OF IT MADE HAVE KINDA LET THE FOUNDATION FOR SOME PRETTY INNOVATIVE THINGS YOU'LL SEE NEXT FEW WEEKS PROPOSALS ARE FOR EXAMPLE- DEPARTMENTS ESTABLISHING THE YOUNG OFFENDER FREE REHABILITATIVE COMMUNITIES PROGRAM. WHICH CLUSTERS YOUNG OFFENDERS TOGETHER TO HAVE MORE- DEDICATE TREATMENT FOR TRAUMA- GONNA SEE A MODERNIZATION OF AQABA TECHNOLOGY TO GET THE MORE ACCESS TO DOING HOMEWORK STUDIES- ALSO ACCESS TO HIGHER EDUCATION THAT CONTINUES THE FRAME THE GROUNDWORK HAS BEEN LAID HAVING THEM GIVEN ACCESS TO YOUR CALL JUSTIN HOPPING HIGHER AT GET BASHERS AGREES I MEAN I WAS. WITHOUT WHAT'S BEEN INVESTMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE THE PAST THAT YOU WOULDN'T HAVE THESE IN A VEHICLES COMING FORWARD- SO LOOKING FOR THE DEFINITELY YOU CAN SEE THOSE AND PRESENTED TO THE COMMITTEE AND- YES ONE MORE BOTTOM BUT I THINK YOU KNOW YOU'VE- GONE TO GREAT LENGTHS OF A THAT FOUNDATION THAT. THE FRUITS LABOR WILL BE COMING FOR NOW WITH THESE INNOVATIVE PROGRAMS THAT ARE GONNA HAVE YOU MENTIONED MORE YOUR THE END OF THOSE NEEDS AND CAN HELP THEM REBUILD EIGHT REHABILITATE FAST. AND YOU KNOW LEADER OF RECESSES. OF RECIDIVISM. THANK THANK YOU BYE THAT CAN I THINK. HOME AT THE- I DON'T ARE WITH THIS. THAT WHAT YOU'VE WITNESS HAS A I'M SURE THE KERR. I THINK WE'RE LOOKING FOR. IS NOT CHEST. HOME GREAT INDIVIDUAL STORES BUT WERE LOOKING FOR IS MUCH LARGER WHOLESALE CHANGE. AND I THINK WHAT WE WANT TO SEE IS- IN A MUCH MORE SYSTEMIC CHANGE AND I THINK PART OF THAT IS AGAIN MAKING SURE WE HAVE THE DATA. TO UNDERSTAND YOU KNOW HOW PEOPLE ARE MOVING ALONG THEIR OWN PERSONAL INDIVIDUAL ROAD MAPS KNOWING THAT EVERYBODY'S ROAD MAPS COULD BE A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENTLY BASED ON THEIR SENTENCE BASED ON THE KIND OF SILLY- BUT- ALSO. YOU KNOW MAKING SURE THAT THE CLASS SAYS THAT- YOU KNOW ARE BEING ARE BEING MATCHED YOU KNOW MUCH OF THE YOU KNOW OKAY AND CAN I DON'T KNOW WHAT PERCENTAGE IT IS RIGHT BUT YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE GETTING OUT OF THE PRIVATE THIS PRINT THE BEST AS WELL SOME OF THESE PRIVATE PRISON CONTRACTORS ARE. THE BIGGEST CONTRACTORS BEHIND THESE WILL BE ABILITY ASIAN PROGRAMS THAT. CORRECT BUT SOME OF THE BIGGEST THING I MEAN THEY'RE THEY'RE PART OF BUT NOT THE BIGGEST NOW IS IT AT THE BECAUSE I JUST THAT THEY'RE THEY'RE LIKE I SAID WE BUT BUT WE WE'VE MADE A DECISION THAT WE'RE GOING TO GET OUT OF CONTRACTING WITH THESE FOLKS BECAUSE WE DON'T OUR OUR INTERESTS AND THEY'RE JUST DON'T REALLY ALONG. CORRECT RIGHT BECAUSE THEIR INTEREST ARE ALIGNED. BY KEEPING PEOPLE IN AS LONG AS POSSIBLE SO THEY KEEP MAKING MONEY. STE SO WHICH IS NOT A WHICH IS NOT ANY OF OUR PRIORS I THINK I THINK WE ALL SHARE THE SAME SAME. ALIGNMENT YEAH THESE ARE SO THE SAME THE FOCUS. WHO HAVE CONTRACTS FOR THESE QUORUM COURT REHABILITATION. PROGRAM RELEASE YES POST RIDLEY CIRCUMSPECT YES HOW ONE METHOD WHICH MIGHT- ALLEVIATE YOUR CONCERNS I DON'T KNOW IF THEY DO THIS BUT IF YOU HAVE A PERFORMANCE- GOALS IN THE CONTRACT. AND THEY DON'T MEET THEM- THERE COULD BE SOME PENALTY OR- SOME. OF OTHER INCENTIVES FOR THEM TO MEET THEM I THINK THAT'S A GREAT POINT I THINK THAT'S WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR I'M LOOKING FOR. PERFORMANCE METRICS DATA. ON A MORE. GLOBAL LEVEL- YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT YOU KNOW HOW WHAT PERCENT ARE INDIVIDUALS ON TO REACHING THEIR GOALS ARE I DON'T THINK WERE. I'M NOT WHAT WE UNDERSTAND THIS IS VERY. CHALLENGING THE WORK IS VERY VERY HARD BUT THE DEAL WITH ALL THE PLAN ON CAPITOL. WE GET OTHERS LIKE THERE'S A LOT OF DATA LACKING. AND YOU KNOW WHAT PROGRESS INMATES ARE MAKING. I BELIEVE THE DATA DOES EXIST WE DON'T HAVE IT HERE WITH ALL STATE WOULDN'T BUT THAT'S WHAT I LOVE AYE I WILL RETRACT THAT STATEMENT CAN YOU KNOW FOR. TOTAL WE MEET AND GO THROUGH THAT DATA. OKAY THANK YOU MANAGER THANK YOU MISTER CHANG- WANNA THANK ALL F YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS ARE I THINK MOST OF THE QUESTIONS ARE PROBABLY HAVE NOT YET BEEN ANSWERED- BUT I DO WANT TO. EMPHASIZE THAT- YEAH WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT AND A DEVELOPING A PLAN. OF FOR AT LEAST THREE FOUR YEARS. AND I AM OPTIMISTIC HOPEFULLY THAT WE WILL SEE A PLAN. THAT WILL COME FORTH IT WOULD BE EASIER FOR. YOU n HAVE POINTED OUT TO DEVELOP PLAN- I'M NOT SURE IF THE PLAN COULD ACTUALLY BE DEVELOPED FROM THOSE WHO RUN PRISONS IF THEIR PRIMARY OBJECTIVE IS TO ALWAYS DEFEND THE PRESIDENT. OF IT- AND THAT. IT JUST IN THE CONVERSATION THERE THAT THEY'RE GONNA DO THAT PUT THEIR BEST FOOT FORWARD TO KEEP THEIR PRISON. DOES IS NOT GOING TO HELP US BASICALLY ARRIVE AT THAT CONCLUSION SO I THINK AS A COMMITTEE WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO MAKE A DECISION FAIRLY SOON. AS TO WHAT WE THINK THE PROCESS SHOULD BE AND MAYBE IT'S NOT THAT PROCESS WHICH WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE. OF COMING FORWARD TO SAY THAT- WE'VE BEEN ASKING FOR THE LONGEST AND AS A RESULT WE HAVE HELD BACK. SOMETIMES RESOURCES AND BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT TO FIND OURSELVES REHABILITATING SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE HAVE IT HAVE PLANS TO. TO BASICALLY CLOSE DOWN FAIRLY SOON OR THERE OR THE COSTA REHABILITATION IS SO GREAT. THAT IT'S NOT WORTH IT BECAUSE WE WOULD HAVE TO DO ENTIRELY. WE HEAR WHAT MY BILL ANOTHER ONE BECAUSE OF THE INVITE. IS AND A HOST OF OTHER THINGS THAT THESE PRISONS HAVE SO WE REALLY NEED TO HAVE A VERY GOOD ASSESSMENT OF OUR SYSTEM- WITH REGARDS TO WHAT ITS NEEDS ARE. AND THEN AS A WELL AS WELL AS WHAT KIND OF SERVICES ARE BEING OFFERED. AS A LOOK AT THE REPORT I SEE THAT YOU HAVE ALL THE INITIALS THE EACH SEASON AND SO FORTH AND SO ON. SO I YOU KNOW I ASK MYSELF A QUESTION- JUST A AS AN AVERAGE A BALLPARK FIGURE HOW MANY PEOPLE DO WE HOW MANY PRISONS DO WE NEED THAT OFFER THESE KINDS OF SERVICES. KNOWING THAT IT'S GOING TO BE SOMEWHAT FLEXIBLE. SO YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET IT TO THE ACTUAL DOWN TO THE VERY END MADE IN TERMS OF USE. BUT IF WE KNEW THAT THERE WAS A NEED FOR EX NUMBER OF ALWAYS SEES WHATEVER THAT IS I WAS LOOKING AT ONE OF THE NUMBERS THAT THAT. OPEN HOUSE SOMETHING SOMETHING OPEN. OUTPATIENT YEAH YEAH ALL YOUR ALL YOUR SYMBOLS YOU'VE GOT IT YOU'VE GOT IT. YOU GOT YOUR YOUR YOUR LEDGER THAT IT TELLS ME ALL THE VARIOUS KINDS OF SERVICES. THAT ARE THAT ARE PROVIDED AT AT A PARTICULAR PRESENT. SO I'M SAYING TO MYSELF OKAY IF I JUST AND I'M NOT THE ONE THAT'S INFORMED IF I'M JUST LOOKING AT BECAUSE THEY WOULD DO I NEED FIVE OF THOSE LITTLE ANY THREE OF THEM. TWENTY TWO OF THEM. YOU KNOW DO THEY WORK WELL WITH THIS SYSTEM VERSES THAT SYSTEM. MY ASSUMPTION IS YOU KNOW THAT ALL THE PEOPLE WHO WORK IN THE OFFICE KNOWS THAT. SO IF WE WERE TALKING ABOUT NEEDS AND MAKING SURE THAT. IF WE IF WE WERE TO CLOSE A PRISON. OF THAT THOSE NEEDS ARE STILL BEING MET- IT WOULD SEEM TO BE LOGICAL THAT THAT WOULD BE A PART OF THE CONVERSATION THAT. WE HAVE TO HAVE EXT NUMBER SERVICES EXT OF A MENTAL HEALTH BILLS BATES WHATEVER IT IS. SO THAT AS WELL AS YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT- OF GETTING RID OF SOME OF THE OLDER PRISONS THE ONES THAT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO REPAIR ANYMORE- THAT THAT WOULD BE. A VERY BOLD SOMETHING THAT WE WOULD LOOK AT. OF CLOSING THE PRISON AS A NO WILL BE A VERY DIFFICULT TASK BECAUSE EVERYBODY I'VE BEEN HAD MEMBERS ALREADY. TELL ME THEY WANT THE PRISONS IN THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD. OF THEY WANT TO- TO KEEP THEM. THERE THAT NOT THE MAJOR ONES BUT THE ONES THAT THEY'RE USING. IN THE SMALLER CITIES THAT THAT HANDLE THE OVERFLOW THAT DON'T PROVIDE. REHABILITATIVE KIND OF SERVICES WE THINK THEY SHOULD HAVE. THAT'S GONNA BE A MAJOR ISSUE BECAUSE THERE'S SOME MEMBERS. WAY DR ECONOMY OF THAT COMMUNITY. YOU KNOW WE AT THAT THAT IS A CONSIDERATION BUT IT CAN'T BE THE MAJOR CONSIDERATION IN TERMS OF WHAT WHAT FACILITIES WE KEEP. UP BECAUSE EVERY. ALL EVERY PRISON HAS A POPULATION. OF PEOPLE THAT THEY EMPLOY. AT AND THEY FOR. INTO THE ECON OF THEIR COMMUNITY. SO YOU KNOW WE CAN'T SAY OKAY WE CAN'T BECAUSE IN THAT CASE WE SHUT NOTHING DOWN. AND I KNOW THAT'S A BIG ISSUE EVEN WITH THE MILITARY WHEN THEY'VE CLOSED DOWN THINGS AS ALWAYS ALL THESE OTHER THINGS. THAT ARE TAKING IN CONSIDERATION YET. US SOMETIMES FOR ECONOMIC REASONS WE HAVE TO DO THAT. SO I YOU KNOW I SEWER COMMITTEE WILL WILL HAVE. A MORE IN DEPTH DISCUSSION ABOUT WHAT WE PLAN TO DO IN TERMS OF MOVING FORWARD. BECAUSE WE CAN'T KEEP ASKING THE SAME QUESTIONS OVER AND OVER- WE'RE GONNA LOOK AT THE REHABILITATION ISSUE THATWAS ONE FROM LAST YEAR- ENDS AND WE MAY ASK FOR. A MORE IN DEPTH REPORT ON THAT I WAS TALKING TO STAFF ABOUT THAT BECAUSE- OF ONCE AGAIN THAT WAS ONE OF THE MAJOR ISSUES THAT. WE WERE PUTTING PEOPLE IN CLASS WE HAVE THE NUMBERS THE DATA. BUT THEY WANT IN THIS ONCE THEY NEEDED. I AM SO YOU KNOW IF YOU TAKING THE FOURTH. SOMETHING AND YOU DON'T KNOW THE FIRST LEVEL. IT'S GONNA BE DIFFICULT FOR YOU TO APPRECIATE THE FOURTH LEVEL- AND SO THAT SEEMS TO BE A- ONE OF THE THINGS IS THERE AND HOW WOULD HOW DO WE ADDRESS THAT- MAYBE EVERY PRISON DOESN'T OFFER ALL OF THE SAME. KIND OF SERVICES OR EITHER YOU LOOK YOU YOU LOOK AT THAT. THERE'S A LOT OF TIMES WE MOVED FROM. LEVEL FOR THIS SECURITY TO THREE TO TWO TO ONE SO MAYBE THERE'S SOME. SOME STRATEGY THAT NEEDS TO BE UTILIZED- IN TERMS OF INTRODUCING MATERIAL AT ONE LEVEL. AND MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO- FOR THEM TO BE. MOVED AS THEY PROGRESS IN AT DIFFERENT LEVELS OF THEIR- INCARCERATION. BUT CLEARLY THIS IS A QUESTION THAT WE KEEP ASKING. OVER AND OVER. A WHERE THE PLAN WAS A PLAN WAS A PLAN. I DON'T THINK WE WANT TO STRIDE PLAN. OF MOST OF US CARE. BUT I DON'T THINK YOU WANT ME TO BECAUSE I DON'T UNDERSTAND ALL THE SYMBOLS BUT ACT MAKE UP- SO. I DON'T THINK YOU WANT THAT TO HAPPEN. ALL WELL I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT I. THINK IT A MUCH MORE JUST A MEDIC WAY. KNOWING THAT EIGHTY PLAN WE PUT TOGETHER MAY HAVE TO BE A- CHANGED. IT OFFICE SOME UPTAKE OR THERE'S SOME GREAT DECLINE SOMEWHERE. WE HAVE TO MAKE THAT ADJUSTMENT WITH TO MAKE THAT CHANGE- BUT IT BUT TO CONTINUE TO. EXIST WITHOUT A CLEAR. ALL MAKES IT VERY DIFFICULT FOR US TO FUND THINGS AND TO. JUSTIFY WHAT WE'RE DOING. AND MEET THE NEEDS OF THOSE WHO INCARCERATED AT THE SAME TIME. OKAY UNDERSTOOD THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE WANT TO GO TO OUR NEXT ITEM. WHICH IS OUR UPDATE OF US STAFF% COMPLAINT PROCESS. AND WILL BEGIN OF CALIFORNIA YOU MISTER OF A SECRETARY YES. I GUESS SO WE I DIDN'T DRAFT UPPER RIGHT UP LARGE TALKING POINTS BUT POPULATION BUT I WILL SAY THAT SINCE SOME THE DEPARTMENT HAS BEEN VENTURING AND WE ARE IN THE- FINALIZE LANGUAGE AS IT RELATES TO THE ALLEGATION ENQUIRING MANAGEMENT SECTION. IT IS A NEW TO NEW. POLICY THAT WE ARE DRAFTING AND PROPOSING TO SUBMIT ON THE NIGHT OF MONTH FOR SUBMITTAL TO THE OFFICE OF ADMINISTRATIVE LAW BY THE FIRST AVAILABLE TO IMPLEMENT THIS NEW DRAFT LANGUAGE THAT- I BELIEVE IT REVAMPS HOW WE AS A DEPARTMENT HANDLE ALLEGATION INQUIRE RES- IN OUR PRISONS AND COMPLAINTS FROM INMATES- THE ORIGINAL CONCERN DEVELOPED FROM AN OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL VISIT TO SALINAS VALLEY STATE PRISON. AND HOW THE INSTITUTION WAS HANDLING THEIR STAFF COMPLAINTS WHAT WHAT WE FOUND AFTER DISCUSSION AS A REPORT WAS DRAFTED. WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT THE CONCERN WERE PRISON STAFF THEMSELVES WERE ASSIGNED TO ANSWER ALLEGATION INQUIRE RES AND WRITE REPORTS- TO THE HIRING AUTHORITY OR THE WARDEN- ON INVESTIGATIONS THAT WERE- DONE THAT WERE. BEING ALLEGE INSIDE THAT SAME PRISON WHAT- WHAT THE CONCERN AND RIGHTLY SO NOW WE CHANGE THAT THE REGULATIONS HERE WAS THAT STAFF MEMBERS ARE FORCED TO WRITE REPORTS ON FELLOW STAFF MEMBERS WOULD BE LIKE. THE PRESSURE WAS TOO INTENSE THE OBJECTIVITY WAS NOT THERE SO A DECISION WAS MADE TO THESE REGULATIONS AND EVEN BEFORE. TO MOVE THAT OUT OF THE PRISON SYSTEM- IT. THAT OUT OF THE PRISON SYSTEM. THANK YOU DOCTOR. WHAT TESTS WERE. OUT OF THE PRISON ITSELF AND THE THROUGH THIS SECTION ALLEGATION MANAGEMENT- SECTION WHICH NOW IT DOESN'T EXIST UNDER THE DIVISION OF ADULT INSTITUTIONS WHICH- THE ENTITY THAT OVERSEES THE PRISON THE THIRTY FIVE INSTITUTIONS. SO THAT. OUT OF THE OFFICE OF- OFFICE- OFFICE OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS AT NOW SITS UNDER A SEPARATE UNDERSECRETARY. WHICH IS UNDER THE- ANOTHER DIRECTOR WHICH IS OUTSIDE OF THE PRISON AND THEY ARE IN CHARGE OF THE OVERSIGHT OF THIS POLICY AND THIS CHANGE AND HOW WE HANDLE APPEALS AND GRIEVANCES. SO WHAT THAT DOES IT GIVES A MORE OBJECTIVE REVIEW OF COMPLAINTS SUBMITTED BY INMATES- AND THAT GIVES- WARDENS A BETTER UNDERSTANDING FROM- FROM OUTSIDE ENTITIES. A WHAT'S IN FRONT OF THEM VERSUS WHAT'S BEEN GENERATED BY THE INSTITUTION AND ALSO- SOLIDIFIES A LANGUAGE THAT THERE WILL BE NO REPRISALS BY ANYBODY FOR FILING A COMPLAINT- IT ALSO. ELIMINATES THE SCREENING PROCESS- WHAT WE USED TO SCREEN OUT IN THE OLD DAYS BEFORE THIS POLICY- LISTINGS ARE SREENED OUT- IT ALSO MANDATES THAT THE STAFF THAT ARE GOING TO BE CONDUCTING MEANS ALLEGATION INQUIRE REESE ARE TRAINED BY SEE POST- WHICH IS A CHANGE FROM THE PAST AND I THINK IT THEY'RE GOING TO BE TRAINED IN A MORE PROFESSIONAL WAY. ONE THAT IT'S MORE INDUSTRY STAND- BUT THEN ALSO- IT ALSO ALLOWS FOR COMPLAINTS IF THEY DO COME BACK AND THERE IS A DISAGREEMENT ON WHAT IS ACCEPTED AS THE STUFF COMPLAINT OR ALLEGATION INQUIRE IT THERE'S ALSO BACKSTOPS. WITHIN THIS REGULATION THAT ALLOW THE- THE NEW DIRECTOR OVER THE OVERSIGHT TO REFERRED THIS OVER TO THE DIRECTOR OF THE HEALTH INSTITUTIONS TO HAVEN'T SECOND LOOK WHAT AWARD AS CHOI. NOT TO THE RIVER SOME FAIR. SO IN THE I BELIEVE REMOVING THE PILLS FOR. THE PRESIDENT. IS A IS A GOOD CHANGE. MOVING INTO AN OUTSIDE ENTITY IS A GOOD CHANGE- REMOVING THE REVIEW PROCESS OUTSIDE OF THE PRISON- IS A GOOD CHANGE- I KNOW. THIS WORK- WE'VE BEEN IN DISCUSSION WITH WITH MANY PEOPLE OVER TO INCLUDE MISTER SPECTER THAT NUMBER IS CONVERSATION MISTER SPECTER AND I KNOW. HE DOESN'T AGREE WITH SOME ASPECTS OF THIS IN THE FINAL CONCLUSION OF IT BUT I BELIEVE WE HAVE MOVED- MOVE THIS POLICY IN AN AREA TO WHERE I BELIEVE WE WILL SEE GAINES. I KNOW THERE IS A REQUESTED AN ASSET THAT THIS NEW POLICY AND REGULATION TAKE ON MORE THAN IT WAS ORIGINALLY INTENDED. TO INCLUDE USES OF FORCE ALL USES OF FORCE TO INCLUDE PRISON RAPE ELIMINATION TO ALMOST MOVED ALL ENQUIRIES UNDER THIS NEW SECTION. BUT I NEED DO NEED TO BE CLEAR THAT THAT'S NOT WHAT THIS A WRITTEN THAT THAT'S NOT WHAT IT WAS ORIGINALLY INTENDED FOR IT WAS INTENDED. TO HAVE A MORE TRANSPARENT OR OBJECTIVE REVIEW OF INMATE ALLEGATION INQUIRE. WHAT WHAT I WOULD SAY IS THAT. I THINK THIS CHANGES THE DYNAMIC. OF HOW THE PRISONS ARE DEALING WITH ISSUES I THINK IT HAS OTHERS OTHER EYES ON THEM THE TRADITIONAL WEREN'T THERE AND IN THE END I BELIEVE THAT THEY'RE GONNA. THE ISSUES ARE BEING ADDRESSED IN HERE- CHANGE HOW INMATES WILL RECEIVE INFORMATION AND THEIR THEIR COMPLAINTS- REMEDIED. I THINK IT'S IN IT'S IN A BETTER PLACE NOW. NOW I KNOW MISTER SPECTER AND I WE DISAGREE ON SOME SECTIONS OF THIS BUT- AS A WHOLE. MOM I THINK THAT WERE OR BETTER OFF WITH THIS THIS NEW POLICY. FINANCE HELLO AS YOU RECALL WE HAD RAISED SOME CONCERNS WITH THIS PROPOSAL WHEN IT CAME THROUGH LAST AS BRING AND WHICH I'M HAPPY TO REITERATE BUT WE DON'T HAVE ANY NEW COMMENTS AT THIS TIME AND WE DO PLAN TO LOOK AT THE REGULATIONS WHEN THEY BECOME AVAILABLE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR YOU TO EVALUATE THIS IN THE BROADER CONTEXT OF WHAT'S HAPPENED IN THIS DEPARTMENT FOR THE LAST FEW DECADES- I WILL GO BACK THAT LONG BUT IF YOU'LL JUST BEAR WITH ME FOR A FEW MINUTES. FIRST OF ALL I LIKE TO START WITH THE PROPOSITION ABOUT YOUR EMPHASIS IN THE LAST PART OF THE HEARING ON REHABILITATION. I THINK THAT'S EVERYBODY'S GOAL OF BUT I THINK- MISTER DE AS WILL AGREE WITH ME THAT YOU CAN'T DO REHABILITATION IN A PLACE. WHERE PEOPLE DON'T FEEL SAFE. AND IN MANY PLACES IN THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS ESPECIALLY OVER TIME. PEOPLE WHO ARE INCARCERATED DON'T FEEL SAFE AND IN SOME CASES THE STAFF DON'T FEEL SAFE EITHER- SO- MY COMMENTS ARE DEVOTED TO MAKING THE BEST. USE OF THIS APPEALS PROCESS SO THAT UP. THE STAFF MISCONDUCT IS MINIMIZED AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE SO IN A FULLY FUNCTIONING SYSTEM- WHERE YOU HAVE GOOD STAFF ACCOUNT ACCOUNTABILITY FOR STAFF OF THE PROBLEMS A WITH STAFF MISCONDUCT ARE IDENTIFIED BY THE DEPARTMENT AND THEY RESOLVED BY THE DEPARTMENT SO THAT THEY DON'T GET OUT OF HAND AND ARE YOU HAVE SAFELY RUNNING PRISONS. ARE UNFORTUNATELY OF THAT HASN'T BEEN THE CASE THROUGH THE HISTORY OF THIS DEPARTMENT AS LONG AS I'VE BEEN DOING THIS AND- I THINK IT'S FAIR FAIR TO SAY THAT- FOR THE REASONS I WILL ARTICULATE IN THE SECOND THAT THE STAFF COUNTY ACCOUNTABILITY SYSTEM IN THE DEPARTMENT. IS BROKEN HAS BEEN BROKEN FOR DECADES- BECAUSE IT'S BEEN A ESSENTIALLY ONE SCANDAL AFTER ANOTHER IT JUST DEPENDS ON WHETHER WE OR SOME OTHER ENTITY LIKE THE OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL HAS BEEN ABLE TO DISCOVER IT. SO AS YOU MAY AS SOME OF YOU MAY REMEMBER AND THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES- QUIRK AND WAS INVOLVED WITH A GLADIATOR FIGHTS WHICH WAS SET UP BY CORRECTIONAL STAFF. THEN IN THE NINETIES THERE WAS PELICAN BAY WHERE THE COURT FOUND THAT THERE WAS AN INTENTIONAL PATTERN OF EXCESSIVE FORCE USED FOR ADMINISTRATIVE PURPOSES AS PUNISHMENT. THAT WAS CURED THROUGH A LEGAL ACTION AND A COURT ORDER IN THE MADRID CASE MORE RECENTLY- HIGH DESERT- WE ON COVERED THROUGH OUR MONITORING OF PEOPLE WITH THIS BILL THE ADA CASE ARMSTRONG- THAT WE DID A OVER WE DISCOVERED A PATTERN AND PRACTICE OF. COME STAFF MISCONDUCT RANGING FROM- EXCESSIVE USE OF FORCE TO RACIALLY OF. RACIAL COMMENTS LATE RACIAL SLURS TO TREATING PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES AND A AND A AT A DISCRIMINATORY MANNER- AND- THEN THIS OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL DD A REPORT ABOUT THAT AND FOUND- FOUND EXACTLY WHAT WE HAD. A LEADS TO OCCURRED AS HAPPENED- IN EVEN MORE RECENTLY IN SALINAS VALLEY STATE PRISON- THERE WAS A PATTERN OF EXCESS OF MISCONDUCT- IT WASN'T CURED BY ANY NONE OF THESE WERE CURED OR EVEN IDENTIFIED BY THE DEPARTMENT TO OUR KNOWLEDGE- AND- THE- OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL WHEN THEY LOOKED AT SALINAS VALLEY FOUND THAT THE WHOLE IN QUERY PROCESS INTO WHETHER THERE IS STAFF MISCONDUCT. WAS COMPLETELY BROKEN BECAUSE THE STAFF FOREIGN TRAINED THEY WERE OFTEN- THE COLLEAGUES OF A SOME. OTHER STAFF MEMBERS WHO WERE DURING THE REVIEW. OF THE WARDENS WEREN'T REFERRING MATTERS UP THE CHAIN TO THE OFFICE OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS IN AN APPROPRIATE WAY AND- THE SYSTEM OF ACCOUNTABILITY LACKED INDEPENDENCE- FROM THE INSTITUTION. SO NOW- I DON'T KNOW WITH WITH THE NEW IT BUT MY COLLEAGUES- AND MY CO COUNSEL FILED A MOTION- RECENTLY JUST ON FRIDAY ABOUT RICHARD DAY DONOVAN- FACILITY WHICH THEY ALLEGED- PERVASIVE STAFF MISCONDUCT AGAINST PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES WHO ARE HOUSED IN THAT FACILITY. AND I JUST LIKE TO KIND OF. READ YOU. A COUPLE OF SENTENCES FROM THAT MOTION WHICH SAYS BASED WHICH ARE BASED O A FIFTIES SOME ODD DECLARATION SIGNED BY PEOPLE WHO ARE INCARCERATED SAYS THAT OFFICERS OF THROWING PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES OUT OF WHEELCHAIRS THEY'RE PUNCHING DEAF PEOPLE WHEN THEY CANNOT HEAR SPOKEN ORDERS THEY'RE BEATING PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES WHO REQUEST HELP CARRYING HEAVY PACKAGES THEIR CLOSING CELL DOORS ON PEOPLE WHO USE WALKERS AND WHEELCHAIRS AND ATTACKING SUICIDAL PEOPLE WHEN THEY ASK FOR MENTAL HEALTH CARE WITNESSES REPORT AT LEAST ONE AND POSSIBLY TWO INSTANCES WHERE STAFF USE FORCE IN A WAY THAT CONTRIBUTED TO THE DEATHS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE INCARCERATED. THAT SOME OF THOSE DECLARATIONS- WERE REVIEWED AND OTHER INFORMATIONAL REVIEWED BY THE FORMER SECRETARY OF THE WASHINGTON STATE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS WHO IS AN EX NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED EXPERT ON PRISON AND HE SAID TO DATE CGC APPEARS TO BE INCAPABLE OF CHANGING THE STAFF CULTURE DESPITE HAVING A WEALTH OF INFORMATION FROM CREDIBLE SOURCES ABOUT THE NATURE AND DEPTH OF THE PROBLEMS OF STAFF MISCONDUCT. THE OMBUDSMAN FOR THE US SECRETARY OF CORRECTIONS OF ROAD IN EMAIL TO- THE DIRECTOR OF ADULT INSTITUTIONS. AND IT'S WORTH QUOTING- AT A LITTLE IN LENGTH SHE SAID- HE SAID WHAT WE HEARD WAS OVERWHELMING ACCUSATIONS OF ABUSE BY THE OFFICERS AND SERGEANTS WITH SERGEANTS AND LIEUTENANTS LOOKING IN THE OTHER DIRECTION I HAVE NEVER HEARD ACCUSATIONS LIKE THIS IN ALL MY YEARS I WOULD STRONGLY SUGGEST PLACING A STRIKE TEAM ON THIS YARD IMMEDIATELY. MANY OF THE INMATES HAVE EXPRESSED FEAR WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO THEM TOMORROW WHEN THE TEAM IS NOT THERE THIS IS A VERY SERIOUS SITUATION AND NEEDS IMMEDIATE ATTENTION IF THERE IS ANY MEANS OF INSTALLING CAMERAS IMMEDIATELY I WAS STRONGLY SUGGESTED AT LEAST IN THE BLIND SPOTS IN THE BACK DOOR OF THE GYM. A REVIEW OF THE APPEAL PROCESS RULE VIOLATION REPORTS AND STAFF COMPLAINTS OR FAT YARD ALSO NEEDS TO TAKE PLACE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE THAT'S THAT'S NOT US THAT'S THE OMBUDSMAN. LATER OF THE CHIEF FONG BIRDS AND WROTE THERE HAS BEEN LITTLE TO NO PROGRESS IN SEPTEMBER I AM NOT TYPICALLY AN ALARMIST BUT AGAIN I HAVE NEVER HEARD SUCH DISREPAIR HOPELESSNESS AND FEAR FROM INMATES. AND I HAVE BEEN ON QUITE A FEW OF THESE TEAMS TO REVIEW AN INTERVIEW INMATES THE CI W. TOUR RESULTS DON'T COME CLOSE TO THIS AND SEE AYE W. WAS VERY BAD. SO IN ADDITION TO THAT- WE HAVE THE SITUATION AT THE- SACRAMENTO COUNTY SACRAMENTO STATE PRISON- AT FOLSOM. WHERE THEY WERE NINE SUICIDES IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN THAT'S AN ASTRONOMICAL RATE OF SUICIDES OFPER POPULATION. THERE WERE THREE HOMICIDES- AND WE'VE JUST LEARNED. FROM A TOUR LAST WEEK THAT. NOT ONLY INMATES ARE FEARFUL OF GET OF RECALL OF LEAVING THEIR CELLS TO GET HEALTH CARE BUT THE DOCTORS NURSES AND OTHER CLINICIANS ARE SCARED TO PROVIDE THE CARE- BECAUSE OF THEIR FEAR OF VIOLENCE. SO WHAT YOU HAVE RIGHT NOW IS THAT CDC ARE REALLY HAS NO WORKING SYSTEM TO IDENTIFY THESE PROBLEMS THAT SYSTEM IS US THE PRISON LAW OFFICE MY COLLEAGUES AND ROADS IN BE GALVANIC GROUND FILLED IN AND THE INSPECTOR GENERAL TO SOME EXTENT IF I WERE TO CHARACTERIZE THE SITUATION IN THE MOST GLOBAL TERMS I WOULD pACCOUNTABILITY SYSTEM- IS NOT INDEPENDENT. OF THE INSTITUTIONS AND- IT'S NOT COMPLETELY CENTRALIZED THAT STILL- WORKING AT THE INSTITUTIONS. SO LAST YEAR- YOU ALL AS THE LEGISLATURE- AND THE ADMINISTRATION- APPROPRIATED TEN MILLION DOLLARS TO HIRE- SPECIALLY TRAINED INVESTIGATORS IN THOSE THE ONES THAT MISSED STE MISTER DE AS WAS REFERRING TO. AND WE APPRECIATE THAT VERY MUCH AND WE APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT THE ADMINISTRATION INCLUDING MISTER DE AS SUPPORTED THAT IN ORDER TO START TO AMELIORATE SOME OF THESE PROBLEMS- AND THOSE INVESTIGATORS WILL BE A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION BECAUSE THEY WILL LIKE MISTER DATA SAID THERE WILL GET ENHANCE TRAINING- AND THEY WORK FOR THE OFFICE OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS WHICH YOU KNOW HAS BEEN. IT'S THAT HAVE THEIR THEIR ABILITY TO PROPERLY INVESTIGATE CASES IN THE PRISONS HASN'T BEEN QUESTION. SOME MIGHT THE PLACE I START FROM IS YOU HAVE A WORKING PART OF THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS. WHAT YOU NEED TO DO IS PUT MORE OF THE CASES INTO THAT DEPARTMENT FOR THEM TO INVESTIGATE BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN TRAINED AS INVESTIGATORS THEY KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING. AND THEY CAN THANK YOU YOU CAN HAVE THE RIGHT. MORE ACCURATE AND RELIABLE RESULTS. SO BUT IN THE NEW REGULATIONS DRAFT REGULATIONS THAT MISTER DE AS REFERRED TO- SOME OF THEM ARE POSITIVE CHANGES THAT- HE MENTIONED A NUMBER OF THEM AND I FULLY SUPPORT THEM BUT SOME OF THEM HAVE FATAL FLAWS BUT THERE FATAL FLAWS BECAUSE IN MY OPINION. THEY REDUCE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE INVESTIGATORS. OF BY REDUCING THEIR INDEPENDENCE ESSENTIALLY- THERE ARE TWO- THERE ARE THREE WAYS I THINK THAT THEY DO THIS ONE IS THAT. ONLY CASES IN WHICH THERE IS NO REPORT OF A USE OF FORCE WHICH- HAPPENS BUT IS VERY IT'S VERY RARE THAT YOU ACTUALLY FIND OUT ABOUT IT. OR CASES IN WHICH- SOMEBODY SUFFERS SERIOUS BODILY HARM OR INJURY AS DEFINED BY THE PENAL CODE SO FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU HAVE AN OFFICER WHO THROUGH IT A PERSON WHO COULDN'T WALK OUT OF A WHEELCHAIR- AND KICK THEM BUT DIDN'T. AND WROTE A REPORT ABOUT IT BUT THERE WAS NO SERIOUS BODILY INJURY THEN THE OFFICE OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS INVESTIGATORS ARE NOT GOING TO DO THAT INVESTIGATION. AT OR IF I PUNCH YOU IN THE FACE AND I'M AN OFFICER AND YOU'RE A PERSON WHO IS INCARCERATED AND I'D I JUST GIVE YOU A BLOODY NOSE OR I GIVE YOU A BLACK GUY- THERE'S NO SERIOUS BODILY INJURY SO THAT ALSO WOULDN'T BE INVESTIGATED BY THE- THE OFFICE OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS INVESTIGATORS CALLED THEY'RE CALLED THE AIMS INVESTIGATORS. AND THE SECOND MAJOR PROBLEM IS THAT THE WARDEN STILL DECIDES WHETHER WHICH OF THE TWO INVESTIGATIVE SYSTEMS THE CASE GOES TO. THE WARDEN DECIDES WHETHER HIS STAFFER GONNA INVESTIGATED OR THE OFFICE OF INSPECTOR. OFFICE OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS INVESTIGATES IT AND- THAT HAS BEEN ONE OF THE MAJOR PROBLEMS IS THAT THE WARDENS HAVE HAD THESE. SITUATIONS UNDER THEIR DIRECTION AND SUPER MEDIA SUPERVISION AND YET THEY HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO ELEVATE THESE. ISSUES TO THE OFFICE OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS IN THE SUFFICIENT WIFE SO THAT MISTER DE AS AND HIS SUBORDINATES UNDERSTAND THAT THERE'S A CRISIS. SO WHAT WHAT. WE'VE BEEN ADVOCATING FOR AND SO FAR WE HAVEN'T REALLY BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN CONVINCING OF THE SECRETARY OR THE ADMINISTRATION THAT IT'S CRUCIAL. IS THAT THE- ALL OF THESE USE OF FORCE CASES SHOULD BE. TURNED OVER TO THE OFFICE. OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS IN ORDER. FOR THEM TO MAKE A DETERMINATION HOW FOR HOW THEY SHOULD BE INVESTIGATED NOT THE WARDEN. AND I CAN GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE OF THE FACT THAT- I'VE SAT IN ON SOME OF THESE COMMITTEES WERE THE WARDEN REVIEWS THESE IN INSTANCES AND- THE SITUATION AS THE WARDEN IS SITTING THERE AND SO ARE ALL THE CAPTAINS AND ASSOCIATE WARDEN SO IT'S BASICALLY A SEA OF GREEN- UNIFORMS- AND HE HAS TO DECIDE WHETHER ALL OF THE PEOPLE THAT THEY KNOW- THEIR FRIENDS ARE GOING TO BE-INVESTIGATED BY THE OFFICE OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS RATHER THAN BY HIM. AND IT'S A OR HER AND IT'S A VERY DIFFICULT DECISION TO MAKE AND I THINK IT- THE WAY THE REGULATIONS A DRAFT OF THE MOMENT. REALLY REDUCES THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE INVESTIGATION AND PLAYS INTO THE FACT THAT. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THESE. INSTANCES OF CONTINUE STAFF MISCONDUCT WHICH ARE NOT GOING TO BE PROPERLY INVESTIGATED. THERE ARE ALSO SOME OTHER TECHNICAL PROBLEMS BUT SO- WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO DO MISTER DE AS IS CORRECT THAT WE HAVE HAD MANY DISCUSSIONS- I'VE HAD WITH HIM I'VE HAD WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE. AND WE REALLY HAVEN'T BEEN. COME TO AN AGREEMENT- AND I THINK IT WILL REALLY REDUCE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE TEN MILLION DOLLARS YOU SPENT IN ORDER TO HAVE THIS- STRAND A SOLVE SOME OF THESE PROBLEMS. OKAY I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE ANY COMMENTS YEAH IBM. WELL I THINK WE WERE RELATIVELY CLEAR LAST TIME WHEN WE TALKED ABOUT THIS AND I FIND IT VERY ALARMING THAT THESE THINGS ARE STILL TAKING PLACE- IN OUR PRISONS. AND I READ A LOT OF THE STORIES AND THEY'RE ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE THAT THEY'RE COMMITTED BAR STAFF. YOU KNOW WE TRY TO OF HOPEFULLY. KEEP THE VIOLENCE DOWN AMONG. THE INMATES BUT IT SEEMS THAT A LOT OF THE STUFF IS INSTIGATED BY PEOPLE WHO WORK FOR US. AND OUR AND WE SHOULD NOT BE DOING THIS I DON'T KNOW WHETHER WE HAVE. DIFFICULTY FINDING PEOPLE TO WORK OR OR OR WHAT BUT THIS DEFICIT. IT'S ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE AND I GUESS SO OFTEN I HEAR ABOUT FOLKS WHO ARE INCARCERATED WHO COME OUT AND TELL ME SOME OF THE THINGS THAT ARE JUST ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE THAT HAPPENED TO THEM WHAT WAS SEXUAL ASSAULT. ALL AND THOSE KINDS OF THINGS AND IT'S JUST- IT'S HORRIBLE THAT WE WOULD HAVE A SYSTEM THAT WE WOULD PROTECT IN SOME WAY. THE KIND OF THINGS THAT OCCUR. YEAH I FIND IT. TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE AND I KNOW IT'S BEEN GOING ON FOR EVER AND IT AND IT BOTHERS ME THAT BECOMES THAT. THE CULTURE OF INCARCERATION IN THIS NATION YOU KNOW THAT. A PERSON. GETS INCARCERATED THE FIRST THING SOMEONE SAYS TO THEM ARE YOU GOING TO BECOME JONES GIRLFRIEND. I MEAN THAT SAYS WE INCOME DON'T THIS LEVEL OF BEHAVIOR. YOU KNOW WHETHER IT'S STATE ABOUT THE POLICE OFFICER OR WHOEVER IT IS. IS LIKE WE EXPECT ABUSE TO OCCUR IN OUR PRISON SYSTEM. WHICH IS TO ME TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE. AND YOU KNOW OF. GOING TO PRISON IS FRIGHTENING ENOUGH BUT KNOWING THAT THERE WILL BE YOU KNOW ALL KINDS OF VIOLENCE ON FOLKS WHEN THEY BEAR. WITH NOBLE. EFFORT TO SEEM TO STOP IT IT SOME POINT WELL YOU HAVE NO MEANS OF TRYING TO- CORRECT IT UP OR OR YOU HAVE NO RIGHTS TO SAY WHAT TOOK PLACE BECAUSE IN THE BE RETALIATION TO YOU. EITHER BY OTHER INMATES OR BY THE FOLKS WHO RUN THE PRISONS THAT I MEAN THAT IS. THAT IS THAT TO ME IS VERY FRIGHTENING AND UNACCEPTABLE AND I CAN'T FIGURE OUT HOW WE COULD EVER EXPECT. TO RUN A SYSTEM OF INCARCERATION. AND EXPECT PEOPLE TO COME OUT BETTER. IF THEY'RE IN THAT KIND OF ENVIRONMENT. IT IT'S YOU KNOW IT'S WORSE IN THE VIOLENCE THEY THEY FACE ON THE STREET SO I'M JUST YEAH I'M VERY CONCERNED AND I AND I KNOW WE'RE GOING TO LOOK AT THE REGULATIONS I HOPE- AND- BECAUSE WE'RE SPENDING MONEY ON THIS BUT ASKING FOLKS WHO WHO HAVE HISTORICALLY. DONE VIOLENCE AGAINST OTHERS TO ONCE AGAIN HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO DETERMINE WHO DOES THE INVESTIGATION AND THOSE KINDS OF THINGS IS JUST DUMB IT I CAN X. SEE HOW WE CAN EXPECT ANYTHING DIFFERENT. AND MAYBE YOU CAN BUT I CAN'T SEE HOW WE'D EXPECT ANY DIFFERENT RESULTS IF THE IF I DON'T EMPHASIZE IN THE BEGINNING. ASSEMBLYMEMBER CHAIR CHAIRWOMAN. FVE EMPHASIZE IN THE BEGINNING THAT WE DO WE DO TAKE THIS SERIOUSLY WE DO- I KNOW. DON AND I'VE HAD MANY DISCUSSIONS AND THIS TYPE OF ACTIVITY THAT DON DESCRIBED- THE END I WANT TO WEED OUT THESE TYPES OF INDIVIDUALS. THAT COMMIT THESE ACTS AND WE HAVE AT THE PARTICULAR INSTITUTION THAT DON SPEAKS ABOUT RJD WE HAVE TERMINATED FOURTEEN INDIVIDUALS AT THAT PRISON- AT ANOTHER INSTITUTION WEIGHT ISSUES WE DISMISS THE SIX INDIVIDUALS- WE DO SICK PROSECUTION A REFER FOR PROSECUTION FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO DO. COMMIT THESE ACTS OF THE DOES TARNISH CPC ARE THAT DOES TARNISH THE GOOD WORK THAT'S DONE BY THE THOUSANDS OF EMPLOYEES AND THE THOUSANDS OF PEACE OFFICERS WHO GO THERE TO DO THE RIGHT THING TO BE ROLE MODELS. WHAT I THINK WHAT WAS SPOKE ABOUT BY MISTER SPECTER. I THINK PART OF IT IS IT IS IN A SIMPLIFICATION OF VARIOUS PROCESSES THAT OCCUR. LIKE I USED TO FORCE PROCESS. EVERY REPORTER EVERY USE OF FORCE THAT IT IS- THAT IS DONE IN OUR INSTITUTIONS FROM THE LOWEST LEVEL TO THE HIGHEST LEVEL THERE'S A REVIEW PROCESS THAT OCCURS AND I KNOW MISTER SPECTER DID SPEAK OF A ROOM FULL OF A SOCIAL WARDENS AND CAPTAINS AND- WHICH I SAT IN THERE. AND MYSELF BUT ALSO IN THAT ROOM IS INSPECTOR GENERAL THERE IN THAT ROOM ALSO LISTENING TO THE REVIEW PROCESS FROM THE BEGINNING FROM THE TIME THE OFFICER WROTE THE REPORT OF THE STAFF MEMBER OF THE REPORT. TO THE INTO WHETHER THEY CLEAR IT OR NOT ALONG THE WAY THAT THEY'RE THERE ARE REFERRALS THAT DO OCCUR FOR INAPPROPRIATE USES OF FORCE OR EXCESSIVE USE OF FORCE IN THAT PROCESS AND IT'S WELL DOCUMENTED IT'S WELL AUDITED BY BY THE O. I. G. THEY PUT ON A SEMI ANNUAL REPORT- I GET I COULD. GOING TO ADD NUMBERS BUT I'LL JUST GO INTO ACTUAL USES OF FORCE IN THE PRISON SYSTEM IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN. SO THEY WERE. 600-020-0407 USES OF FORCE WE'RE DOING AND IT POLICY BY THE COMMITTEE OUT OF ALL THAT 600-020-0404 ONE OF THOSE THE ORANGE DISAGREED WITH. NOW I CAN WHAT OF THOSE FORTY ONE THE VERY DAY AND THE LEVEL OF DISAGREEMENT WHETHER IT BE ON THE PUNISHMENT OR WHETHER BE ON THE PROCESS OR REFERRAL. WHAT I'M EXPLAINING TODAY IS THAT THIS NEW REGULATION WILL ADDRESS SOME OF THESE CONCERNS DON AND I DO DISAGREE. ON ONE PARTICULAR AREA FOR THAT WERE THERE'S A FORK IN THE ROAD AFTER THE- INVESTIGATION IS DONE OF IN KOREA IS DONE BY THE NEW UNIT. THAT WHO DETERMINES WHETHER SHE GOT OFFICE INTERNAL AFFAIRS SHOULD IT BE. THE NEW AIMS UNIT. WHICH IS A CAPTAIN OR A LIEUTENANT BECAUSE THE WAY THAT THIS IS DESIGNED AS CAN BE BROKEN UP INTO THREE REGIONS. NORTHERN CENTRAL SOUTHERN. THE BE A CAPTAIN OVERSEEING EACH ONE OF THOSE UNITS AND LIEUTENANTS THAT WORK AND DO THESE ENQUIRIES. SO THE THOUGHT IS ONCE A COMPLAINT IS REFERRED UP TO THE AIMS UNIT. THE LIEUTENANT'S GO AND THEY DO AN INQUIRY THEY REVIEW THE DOCUMENTS TO INTERVIEW INMATES THEY GENERATE A DOCUMENT REFER IT BACK. AND IT'S UP TO THAT HUNDRED THIRTY THEN THEY CAN MAKE THAT DECISION IS IT GONNA GO TO THE OFFICE OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS. OR THEY'RE GONNA DO A MORE LOCALIZED TRAINING OR OR OTHER MATTERS. BUT THERE'S ALSO ANOTHER STEP THAT I SPOKE OF BRIEFLY. THAT IF THERE'S A DISAGREEMENT OR IN THEIR- IF THERE IS- A DECISION MADE BY THAT WHARTON THEY'RE GONNA HAVE TO. ARTICULATE IN THIS POLICY WHY THEY CHOSE NOT TO REFER. THAT REFERRAL. AND THOSE DOCUMENTS THERE WILL BE AUDITED BY THIS NEW- NEW UNIT. AND IF THERE'S ANY DISAGREEMENTS WITH THAT EGGS REFERRED TO THE DIRECTOR OF ADULT INSTITUTIONS THE ASSOCIATE DIRECTORS. AND THEN THEY CAN MAKE A DETERMINATION FOR IT GOES. FOR MINUTE SPECTRUM NIGHT. ON THAT PIECE ARE THOSE REGULATE OF. NOW FOR US TO REVIEW THEY'RE IN THEIR END DRAFT. I THINK WHAT I SENT IT TO YOU CHEN THE NINE. TO GET THE LATEST ONE YEAH TO. MONICA WE HAVE THE MAKE. WELL BOTH OF US HAVE THEM HE SENT IT TO ME SO I AM SURE WILL HOPEFULLY WE'LL GET A CHANCE TO SEE THEM BEFORE THEIR- FULLY IMPLEMENTED. THE COMMITTEE COULD SEE THEM YET PLEASE LOOK. QUICKLY BECAUSE HE'S GONNA SUBMIT THEM TO THE- A. L. AND A WEEK. OUR SERVER OKAY WHICH I THINK IT WOULD BE NICE IF- WELL WE NEED TO SEE THEM BEFORE THE FULLY IMPLEMENTED FOR THE COMMITTEE TO REVIEW THEM. BEFORE PAYING THAT KIND OF MONEY FOR THE REPORT. YEAH AND I JUST HAVE ONE FINAL COMMENT WHICH IS GIVEN ALL THE- TERRIBLE ABUSES THAT HAVE HAPPENED OVER THE YEARS I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY. I KNOW IF THIS IS A PROFESSIONAL DISAGREEMENT AND I UNDERSTAND MISTER DE AS A- HE ANSWERS TO A LOT MORE CONSTITUENTS THAN I DO- BUT GIVEN THE SITUATION- I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY HE- THE STATE'S STATE AS A WHOLE ISN'T. GOING FOR THE MOST INDEPENDENT SITUATION THAT THEY CAN HAVE AND THE MOST VIGOROUS INVESTIGATIONS THAT THEY CAN HAVE BOTH OF THE THINGS I'M SUGGESTING ARE AIMED IN THAT DIRECTION AND GIVEN THE SITUATIONS THAT WE JUST DISCOVERED AT RJ DE I JUST. WHICH IS. I'D IN ORDER BEEN HISTORY THESE KINDS OF CASES I THINK THAT'S WHAT'S NEEDED WHEN I. I HAVE A FRIEND WHO'S A THE DIRECTOR OF THE PENNSYLVANIA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS CITIES THE SEC. OF THAT. AND I CALLED HIM UP WHEN THE SLINGS VALLEY CASE WAS GETTING GOING AND THE ORIGIN WAS DOING THE REPORT I SAID WHAT JOHN WHAT DO YOU DO AND HE SAID WHAT I DID WAS I. FOUND SOMEBODY A FORMER FBI AGENT. HI MADE HIM IN CHARGE OF THE OFFICE OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS AND I TOOK ALL OF THE- DISCRETIONARY DECISIONS AWAY FROM THE WARDENS AND LOCATED IN THE OFFICE OF AN INTERNAL AFFAIRS AND MICE THE SITUATION HAS SUBSTANTIALLY IMPROVED I CAN'T VERIFY THAT BUT THAT'S WHAT HE SAID. SO I THINK THAT'S THE DIRECTION THE DEPARTMENT HAS TO GO AND IF IT'S GOING TO HAVE ANY HOPE OF IDENTIFYING THESE PROBLEMS AND FIXING THEM. THANK YOU THANK YOU DID YOUR THING THEN. LIST OF. I DO I GUESS I'M- A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED IN HOW THIS IS ULTIMATELY ROLLING OUT. BECAUSE THE. WE HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL IN THE MESSAGE THAT WE'RE SENDING WITH THE REGULATIONS AND I APPRECIATE. YOUR THAT YOU ARE THE SECTOR ABSOLUTELY SERIOUS ABOUT THIS. BUT BECAUSE WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO CHANGE ITS ESSENCE IS CULTURAL AND CULTURE THAT'S BEEN BUILT UP OVER DECADES TO DO THAT I THINK WE NEED TO TAKE. A BIT MORE DRAMATIC STEP THANOTHERWISE IN ANYTHING THAT. I THINK WITHOUT A DEFAULT MADAM CHAIR TO A VERY VERY CLEAR INDEPENDENCE. WE'RE NOT SENDING BACK RIGHT MESSAGE. AND WE OFTEN UP HERE TALK ABOUT THE PRISON SYSTEM IN GENERAL BUT IT CAN NOT ALWAYS THAN ABOUT SPECIFIC POPULATIONS BUT BY EXAMPLE AND SOME OF IT IS AN- THE STAFF REPORT. I THINK WOMEN WHO ARE CARS RATED FACE SOME VERY DRAMATIC CIRCUMSTANCES THAT ARE HARD TO GET OUT OF IT HARD TO CHANGE FACT HAVE BEEN RECENTLY TALKING JUST BEGINNING TO CUT HAVE CONVERSATIONS. SOME PEOPLE WHO HAVE. GONE INTO SOME OF THE WOMEN'S FACILITIES THERE. AT THE- SEE TO BE FAIRLY PERVASIVE HOW MUCH I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE VERY DIFFICULT TO ASCERTAIN. BECAUSE IN A NUMBER OF THE WOMEN WHO EVEN WHEN THEY COME OUT OR SO TRAUMATIZED BY WHAT HAPPENED AND SO FEARFUL OF TALKING. WHAT I'VE ASKED IF THERE'S A WILLINGNESS COME TALK TO ME TO HELP EXPLAIN SO THAT THAT I CAN UNDERSTAND WHAT HAPPENED INSIDE THERE'S A REAL UNWILLINGNESS FOR WOMEN WHO HAVE COME OUT. TO EVEN ARTICULATE WHAT HAPPENED INSIDE THERE SO AFRAID. OF CONSEQUENCES. THEY'RE OUTSIDE. NOT INSIDE ANYMORE THAT IT'S HARD I THINK FOR US TO SIT HERE AND IMAGINE WHAT IT'S LIKE. AND THE TRAUMA AND THE FEAR. INSIDE SO THE THIS COMMITTEE HASN'T ALWAYS FOCUSED ON THE INSTITUTIONS FOR WOMEN AND THAT IS ONE OF MY SUGGESTIONS BUT I'M TEARS THAT WE TAKE A LOOK AT THAT. AND SEE IF THERE'S A WAY THAT WE CAN. GET BETTER INFORMATION. IN A PRODUCTIVE WAY ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING THERE SO IF THERE'S AN INVESTIGATION THAT HAS ANY POSSIBILITY. OF BEING DEALT WITH INSIDE. I THINK THAT'S GOING TO CHANGE VERY DRAMATICALLY THE CHARACTER OF SOMEBODY WHO IS INSIDE A WOMAN WHO'S INSIDE. THEIR WILLINGNESS TO COME FORWARD AT ALL IN THE FIRST PLACE. BECAUSE OF THAT THAT IF IT. THAT FEAR WILL BE I THINK VERY DEBILITATING TO THE CASE IF THEY HAVE CONFIDENCE THAT THERE WILL ALWAYS BE AN OUTSIDE INVESTIGATION. AND PRINT AND THE ABILITY TO PROTECT THEM FROM RETALIATION ALTHOUGH I THINK THE CULTURE IS SUCH THAT THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BELIEVE. THAT YOU CAN SAY THE REGULATIONS CAN SAY AND THE STRUCTURE CAN BE THAT THEY WILL BE PROTECTED FROM ITALIAN ASIAN THEY WILL NOT BELIEVE. IF THEY'RE STILL CARING THAT FEAR ONCE THEY COME OUT. I DON'T SEE HOW THEY ON THE ANYONE ON THE INSIDE. WE'LL WE'LL BE ABLE TO TRUST OF THAT UNTIL THAT PROCESS STARTS TO SHOW REAL RESULTS. SO I WOULD HOPE THAT THIS COMMITTEE COULD TAKE A LITTLE BIT LOOK AND LET'S I THINK WE SHOULD TAKE A LOOK AT. THE FACILITIES FOR WOMEN SPECIFICALLY AND MAYBE THIS COMMITTEE AND OR PUBLIC SAFETY AND SEE IF WE CAN GET A BETTER SENSE OF WHAT'S HAPPENING. HOW IT'S HAPPENING. AND HOW WE REALLY FIND A TRULY INDEPENDENT AND EFFECTIVE WAY OF GETTING THE STORIES TOLD AND THEN STARTING TO DRIVE THAT. TO DRIVE THAT CHANGE SO IT'S THOSE PATTERNS THAT WERE TRYING TO BREAK DOWN THOSE PATTERNS THAT HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED A LONG TIME. AND THE INSTITUTION. BOTH THE THAT THE WOMEN HER IN THE INSTITUTION AN INSTITUTION ITSELF HAVE RELIED ON. THOSE PATTERNS FOR SO LONG THAT BREAKING THOSE PATTERNS OF BREAKING THE EXPECTATIONS I DON'T THINK IS GOING TO BE AN EASY TASK AT ALL- ESPECIALLY WHEN PEOPLE ARE SO AFRAID TO COME FORWARD. SO I. I'M VERY INTERESTED TO SEE THE REGULATIONS I THINK WE NEED TO SEE THE REGULATIONS. BUT IF THOSE REGULATIONS DO NOT FOSTER ENOUGH OF A GUARANTEE OF THAT INDEPENDENCE OF THAT OUTSIDE LOOK AND THAT REAL SENSE OF PROTECTION FROM RETALIATION AND THAT'D BE DEMONSTRATED THAT TO BE ARTICULATED AND THAT DEMONSTRATED. I DON'T KNOW THAT WE'RE GOING TO GET THE INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT'S REALLY HAPPENING. IN THE CASES THAT WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND. THIS OF THE CRISIS THAT THAT I FEEL IS THERE. BUT IS NOT ABLE TO BE REALLY EXPLAIN THAT AT THE LEVEL THAT I THAT I THINK WILL BE HELPFUL BECAUSE IF IT'S AT ALL PARTIALLY TRUE IT IS FRIGHTENING AND IF THE WHAT I'M HEARING IF IT SEEMS AS PERVASIVE AS IT IS ENTIRELY UNACCEPTABLE AND REALLY ABSOLUTELY OUT OF CONTROL SO I UNDERSTAND YOUR PROCESS AND SETTING THE REGULATIONS. BUT FOR ME I THINK IT I THINK BY HOPEFULLY FOR THIS COMMITTEE THAT IF WE'RE NOT COMFORTABLE WITH THE LEVEL OF INDEPENDENCE THAT'S THERE THAT THAT'S NOT GOING TO BE ACCEPTABLE HERE AND IS NOT GOING TO FLY BECAUSE THAT'S GOING TO BE A CORNERSTONE TO REALLY BEING ABLE TO HAVE ACCESS TO THE INFORMATION AND TO THAT THE STATE OF WHAT'S INSIDE INSIDE. I THINK IT'S BEEN. IT'S GONE ON FOR SO LONG TIME. THAT WITHOUT A REAL DRAMATIC STATE WITH THE THESE REGULATIONS SHOULD NOT BE JUST. A NEXT STEP. AND OPENING AWAY YET BUT SHOULD BE A DRAMATIC STEP TO SHOW THAT THE DEPARTMENT THAT WE- EVERYONE IS VERY VERY SERIOUS ABOUT. MAKING THAT THE KINDS OF CULTURAL STRUCTURAL THOSE CHANGES. TO ENSURE. THE SAFETY ON THE INSIDE. SO I HAVE. SOMEONE STONE. WE HAVE SOME WOMEN WE'VE BEEN TALKING TO AT THE CALIFORNIA INSTITUTION FOR WOMEN WHO HAVE BEEN ADVOCATING FOR PUBLICLY IF YOU WANT TO KNOW IF YOU WANT TO TALK TO THEM WE'LL BE HAPPY TO GO DOWN THERE WITH YOU AND- I THINK THEY WOULD PROBABLY- BE WILLING TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT SOME OF THE- ISSUES THAT THEY MAY. BECAUSE I'M HEARING THIS FROM SOME FOLKS TO INSIDE AND WHEN THEY'RE REELING BACK TO ME SO I WOULD HAVE YOU I THINK. FROM THIS COMMITTEE FORMALLY. SHOULD MAKE THAT REQUESTED A POTENTIALLY GO DO SOME TOURS IN AND SORT OF SEE WHAT. WHAT WE CAN DO BECAUSE I ALSO IT FOR ALL THE WORK THAT WE HAVE DONE WITH THE REHABILITATION SIDE AND- THE REFORMS AND ALL THAT THE MESSAGE THAT I'M GETTING BACK IN AGAIN THIS IS THIRD HAND. THEY'RE NOT FEELING. ANY APPROPRIATE ATTENTION BEING PAID IN THE WOMEN'S FACILITIES BECAUSE WE ARE TALKING MORE GENERALLY. AND I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THAT WE NEEDED LEGISLATURE TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR ADDRESSING THE FACT THAT WE HAVE NOT ALWAYS BEEN. THERE AND BEEN AVAILABLE AND I THINK IF WE TAKE SOME SOME MORE FROM HIS STEPS AND SHOW THAT THERE'S- ATTENTION BEING PAID THAT WE'RE WILLING TO LISTEN AND BE A PART OF THIS PROCESS. I THINK JUST THAT WILL WILL ALSO. GO A LONG WAYS BUT ALSO MISS SECTOR I'M I'M HOPING THAT WHAT YOU PERCENT AND I THINK THAT. WHAT WE WOULD EXPECT IS SOMETHING THAT IS. EVEN BEYOND KIND OF CURRENT STATUS BUT IS THE WITH THE GREATEST AMOUNT OF INDEPENDENCE OF REVIEW BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO BE A CREDIBILITY QUESTION FOR THAT WHOLE SYSTEM RIGHT I AGREE AND APPRECIATE BOTH YOUR COMMENTS AND I TAKE THAT VERY SERIOUSLY TO THE I MEAN I TO THE POINT TO WHERE I. KNEW I WAS GOING TO BE HERE.THEN I SENT OUT- THE LINK TO THIS HEARING TO ALL THE WARDEN SO THEY CAN UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF THE SO THEY CAN SEE. WHAT WE'RE DOING WHAT WE'RE DISCUSSING THAT IT IS IMPORTANT. ONE OF THESE ALLEGATIONS IS FAR TOO MANY. THAT WERE FAR TOO MANY I TAKE IT VERY SERIOUSLY- YES WE ARE SEEKING FUNDING FOR CAMERAS IN THESE FACILITIES TO EXPAND OUR CAMERAS ON THE YARDS AT RJD. AT THE WOMEN'S FACILITY AT C. O. W. AT SALINAS VALLEY. TO ASSIST WITH SOME OF THESE CULTURAL ISSUES. BUT YOU KNOW LIKE YOU SITTING HERE LISTENING TO THE CRITICISMS OF THE AGENCY THAT I BELIEVE IS DOING GOOD WORK BUT DEFINITELY CAN BE DOING BETTER-IT DOES AFFECT ME. YOU KNOW NOT ONLY IS PROFESSIONAL BUT PERSONALLY. BECAUSE I CARE ABOUT THE POPULATION I DO CARE ABOUT THESE PRISONS I DO CARE ABOUT WHAT WE'RE PRODUCING ONCE A RELEASE. AND I'M SAD TO HEAR ABOUT. THE STORIES OF PEOPLE LEAVING IT ONLY WANT TO TALK ABOUT I EXPERIENCE. OTHER STORIES THAT ARE OPPOSITE OF THAT SO I'M SURE SOMEWHERE IN THE MIDDLE THAT WE NEED TO IMPROVE THAT. OBVIOUSLY MOST OF US ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE. OF THE REGULATIONS AND SO I'M GOING TO SUGGEST THAT THE THAT YOU BEFORE YOU SUBMIT THEM THAT THIS COMMITTEE HAVE ACCESS TO THEM. AND THAT WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS SOME. PRIOR TO THE SUBMIT AND MEAN IT YOU KNOW WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE FORT SUBMIT IT. RATHER THAN HAVING TO RESPOND TO IT AFTER THE FACT. AND WE HAVEN'T SEEN IT SO- WE WOULD LIKE TO. BE ABLE TO WEIGH IN ON IT AND A- GET SOME SENSE OF- FEELING THAT IT THAT IT IS SO. THAT IS ACCEPTABLE. AS YOU SINCE IT'S SO MUCH WORK HAS GONE INTO. ANOTHER WE COULD TO WON'T GO PROBABLY DELAY IT THAT MUCH. I'M I'M NOT SURE THE MECHANICS OF IT I DON'T KNOW BUT CLEARLY. AND DONT. SENATE OVER DUE. TO THE STAFF. OKAY BUT WE- I BELIEVE ANY REVIEW THERE I THINK THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME CONTACTS WITH EXPLANATION. SURE EDUARDO PORTION OF AND THAT'S WHY I SAY IT. WAS IF IT'S SENT TO US THEN WE WOULD HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO MEET ABOUT IT. AND HAVE CONVERSATION WITH YOU AND WHOEVER ELSE IS INVOLVED IN IT. YEAH EITHER THE AUTHORS OF IT- TO FIND OUT EXACTLY WHAT THE RATIONALE IS FOR. AND WHATNOT- THEY THEY BELIEVE IT'S GOING TO ANSWER THE ISSUES THAT WE RAISED IN THAT WE'RE GOING TO SEE. A DRAMATIC CHANGE AND WHAT'S WHAT IS TAKING PLACE- THAT WILL BE VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT IS POINTED OUT WITH MISSED A STONE THE HISTORIC NATURE. OF THE ABUSES THAT HAVE OCCURRED IN A- AND LIMITED RESPONSE. FROM US TO THOSE ISSUES WILL MAKE SURE. THAT WE ARE FINDING THAT PEOPLE KNOW THAT. IS A. THIS IS HERE IN TOWN. NEW GROUP PEOPLE WHO DIFFERENCE OF EYES. IF OF VALUES. IT MAY BE THAT THE IS A C. F. AND WE WANT TO. MAKE THAT IT TAKES FOR. AND THAT WILL BE IMPORTANT FOR US AS WELL AS FOR THOSE WHO ARE- THAT WE HAVE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THAT ARE IN OUR CUSTODY- I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL FOR COMING. WE DO HAVE UP PUBLIC COMMENTS. I GOT YOUR FOR ANYONE WANTS TO MAKE A COMMENT YOU HAVE ONE MINUTE TO COMMENT NOT VERY LONG- CONCERNING IT MAKE SURE YOU GIVE US YOUR NAME AND YOUR- JUST. YOUR NAME AND IF YOU HAVE AN AFFILIATION- BUT WILL TAKE COMMENTS FOR ONE MINUTE IF YOU PLAN TO MAKE COMMENTS PLEASE GET IN LINE- SO WE HAVE ONE PERSON WHO'S GOING TO COME IT. IS THAT CORRECT. IF YOU PLAN TO COMMENT PLEASE GET IN LINE ALSO WE HAVE SOME SENSE OF THE AMOUNT OF TIME WE ARE. UP AGAINST A DEADLINE TO CLOSE UP THE HEARING. OKAY THANK YOU. YES OKAY SO MY NAME IS DIANA CREWS.
