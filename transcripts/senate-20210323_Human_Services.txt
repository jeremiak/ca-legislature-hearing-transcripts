CONSULTANT PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. HER TADO HERE. JONES CORTESE. KAMLAGER PAN THERE. WE HAVE A QUORUM. OKAY WE HAVE A QUORUM LET'S CALL UP OUR FIRST AUTHOR TO PRESENT THEIR FELT. AND FIRST UP IS. SENATE BILL FOUR THREE FOUR BY SENATOR BATES. SENATE RATES UP PLEASE FEEL FREE TO BEGIN WHEN YOU ARE READY. FIVE MILLION. YES THEY BEGIN YES. I WAS DISTRACTED ANYWAY THANK YOU ARE BETTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS LIKE SB FOUR THIRTY FOUR PROHIBITS AN OPERATOR OF A LICENSE RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT FACILITY OR CERTIFIED ALCOHOL OR OTHER DRUG PROGRAM FROM PROVIDING ANY FORM OF FALSE ADVERTISING OR MARKETING SERVICES MY NAME THIS BILL BRANNON SAW AN HONOR OF BRANDON NELSON WHO PASSED AWAY IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN AT THE AGE OF TWENTY SIX AND AN UNLICENSED REHAB HOME HIS PARENTS WHO SIGNED BRANDON UP FOR CARE AT WHAT THEY BELIEVED. WAS A TREATMENT FACILITY AND WE'RE SURE THAT HE WOULD RECEIVE THERAPY SESSIONS THE CASE MANAGER A HOUSE MANAGER AND MORE UNFORTUNATELY THAT IS NOT WHAT HE RECEIVED ACCORDING TO A COMPREHENSIVE INVESTIGATION BY THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA NEWS GROUP IT FOUND AND I QUOTE NELSON DIDN'T HAVE A TEAM OF PROFESSIONALS OVERSEEING HIS TRANSITION HE APPARENTLY DIDN'T EVEN GET HIS MEDICATIONS ON TIME. AND ACCORDING TO HIS PARENTS AND POLICE REPORTS WHAT HE THOUGHT WERE SALES PITCHES. NOT HEALTH CARE ADVICE. M. QUOTE I BELIEVE WE HAVE AN ALL. AS ALLEGE TO MAKE SURE THAT NO PERSON HAS TO GO THROUGH WITH THEM WAT BRANDON AS FAMILY WENT THROUGH. OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS THE LEGISLATURE HAS RECOGNIZED THAT CONSUMERS WITH SUBSTANCE ABUSE DISORDERS HAVE DISABLING CONDITIONS AND THAT THESE CONSUMERS AND THEIR FAMILIES ARE VERY VULNERABLE. HOWEVER THERE ARE NO PROVISIONS IN THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE TO CONTROL UNETHICAL MARKETING PRACTICES THAT PREY ON DISTRESSED FAMILIES. OR INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE SEEKING TREATMENT AS A RESULT OF PATIENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES CAN BE MISLED MISDIRECTED MISDIAGNOSED BY AND QUALIFIED INDIVIDUALS. THE GOAL OF SB FOUR THIRTY FOUR IS PROTECT INDIVIDUALS WITH ADDICTION. AND ENSURE THAT THEY ARE RECEIVING THE TREATMENT THAT THEY ARE PROMISED MARKETERS WHO KNOWINGLY AND WILLFULLY MAKE MATERIAL FALSE STATEMENTS. WHETHER IN ADVERTISING OR BY DIRECT COMMUNICATION WITH CURRENT OR POTENTIAL PATIENTS. MUST BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE. S. FOUR THIRTY FOUR OFF ALSO AUTHORIZES THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES TO INVESTIGATE ALLEGATIONS. OF MISCONDUCT AND IMPOSE SANCTIONS ULTIMATELY THIS MEASURES SEEK TO PROTECT. THOSE WHO ARE AT THEIR MOST VULNERABLE AND SEEKING TREATMENT. THE BILL SUPPORTED BY THE CALIFORNIA CONSORTIUM OF ADDICTION PROGRAMS AND PROFESSIONALS AND THE ADVOCATES FOR RESPONSIBLE TREATMENT. HE SIMILAR VERSION OF THIS BILL PASSED THIS COMMITTEE IN TWENTY NINETEEN BUT WAS VETOED BY THE GOVERNOR AT THAT TIME THE BILL ADDRESSES THOSE CONCERNS. IT PASSED OUT OF SENATE HEALTH ON CONSENT AND SO I ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT OF BRANDON'S LOST. IN HERE BUT HERE I BELIEVE TELECONFERENCING OF ROSEN ALLEN NELSON THE PARENTS OF BRANDON. WILL TESTIFY IN SUPPORT TODAY. WE WILL NOW OPEN UP TO WITNESSES IN SUPPORT AND OPPOSITION LEADER WITNESSES AND SUPPORT WILL BE AND OPPOSITION WILL BE LIMITED TO THREE MINUTES EACH- THE FIRST WITNESS CAN FEEL FREE TO BEGIN WHEN YOU'RE READY. THIS IS ALAN NELSON- AND THANK YOU SENATOR BATES FOR TAKING AN INTEREST IN OUR FAMILY'S TRAGEDY AND INTRODUCING S. B. PORT THIRTY FOUR BRANDON'S WALL. MY WIFE ROSE AND I HAVE BEEN MARRIED FOR THIRTY THREE YEARS OUR YOUNGEST SON JUSTIN IS A CAL GRAD TWENTY THREE YEARS OLD AND LIVES WITH US IN SANTA MONICA WORKING ON A MUSIC CAREER. OUR MIDDLE SON TRENT ON HARVARD GRAD LIVES IN BOSTON A WORKS FOR A TECHNOLOGY COMPANY. OUR OLDEST SON BRANDON IS TWENTY NINE YEARS OLD A U. EIGHT EIGHT AEROSPACE ENGINEERING GRAD AND HAS LIVED IN HEAVEN FOR THE PAST THREE YEARS IN FIFTEEN DAYS. UNFORTUNATELY HE IS UNABLE TO PROVIDE HIS IMMENSE TALENTS TO THE WORLD. IN JANUARY OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN BRANDON HAD A PSYCHOTIC BREAK IN WAS TAKEN IN ON A FIFTY ONE FIFTY THAT WAS AN EXTENDED. PRIOR TO THAT HE HAD BEEN EMPLOYED IN THE AEROSPACE INDUSTRY AND A CONTRIBUTING MEMBER OF SOCIETY. ONCE COMMITTED INTO THE MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM ROSE AND I ASSUME BRANDED WOULD BE WELL TAKEN CARE UP. WE KNEW NOTHING ABOUT THE MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM BUT ASSUME THAT THERE WOULD BE STRICT REGULATION AND OVERSIGHT THAT WOULD PROVIDE CARD RAILS FOR HIS TREATMENT. BRANDON'S EXPERIENCE NOTHING COULD BE FURTHER FROM THE TRUTH. BRANDON WAS PASSED FROM FACILITY TO FACILITY ENDING UP IN A FOR PROFIT PROGRAM THAT REPRESENTED TO US THAT THEY HAD PROFESSIONAL PSYCHIATRISTS AND COUNSELORS. INSTEAD THE BRANDED ENDED UP IN A SOBER LIVING HOME WITH NO INDIVIDUAL ATTENTION BUT RATHER A GROUP SESSION RUN BY AN UNLICENSED COUNSELOR HE WAS NOT GIVEN IS NEEDED MEDICATION PRESCRIBED BY THE PRIOR NONPROFIT HOSPITAL SHE WAS NOT MONITORED AS AND THEN PROMISE. AND AT SEVEN FORTY FIVE PM ON MARCH EIGHTH TWENTY EIGHTEEN BRANDON HUNG HIMSELF IN THE SOBER LIVING HOME FROM AN EXPOSE FIRE SPRINKLER AND ONE OF THE SOBER LIVING HOME BEDROOMS. THE NINE ONE ONE CALL IS CHILLING AND I WOULD LIKE TO SUBMITTED INTO EVIDENCE. HOUSE MANAGER OF THE SOBER LIVING HOPE DID NOT KNOW THE ADDRESS OF THAT HOUSE HE DID NOT KNOW BRANDON'S NAME HE DID NOT KNOW BRAND INSPIRED HISTORY ANY DOT DID NOT KNOW HOW TO ADMINISTER CPR. BRANDON'S EXPERIENCE ROSEN I BELIEVE THE CALIFORNIA MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM SHOULD BE REVIEWED FROM TOP TO BOTTOM. AND WE HAVE SOME SUGGESTIONS BASED ON WHAT WE HAVE SEEN IN BOTH NONPROFIT AND FOR PROFIT FACILITIES. STRICT REGULATION AND OVERSIGHT COULD HAVE PREVENTED OUR FAMILY AND NO DOUBT HUNDREDS OF OTHER FAMILIES. FROM BEING SENTENCED TO A LIFETIME OF GRIEF. IN THE MEANTIME SB FOUR THIRTY FOUR IS A STEP TOWARDS MAKING SURE. THE FOR PROFIT FACILITIES RUN BY UNSCRUPULOUS CHARLATANS PROVIDE THE CARE OF THE BABY PROMOTE AND ADVERTISE. I DO NOT JUST MAKE EMPTY PROMISES TROLLING FOR HUMAN ATM MACHINES WITH NO REGARD FOR THE WELFARE. AS WAS DONE WITH BRANDON. THANK YOU AND IF I COULD KNOW HOW TO SUBMIT THE NINE ONE ONE CALL INTO TESTIMONY I'D APPRECIATE THAT. THANK YOU. AND WE WILL FOR NOW FOR MARCH SECOND WITNESS. ROSE NELSON. HELLO THANK YOU SENATOR BAIT FOR OFFERING SB FOUR THREE FOREIGNERS FUNDS HONOR BRANDON WOULD HAVE ADVOCATED FOR THIS BILL SHOULDN'T HAVE SURVIVED THESE RE HAVE RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT FACILITY SHOULD NOT MARKET ADVERTISE OR PROMOTE SERVICES THAT THEY DO NOT PROVIDE TO THE MENTALLY ILL OR THOSE WHO SUFFER FROM ADDICTION THE SO CALLED REHAB FACILITIES HAVE SLICK WEBSITES PROMISING PROFESSIONAL HELP FROM PSYCHIATRISTS PSYCHOLOGISTS AND THERAPISTS AND CASE MANAGERS. SO WHAT DOES THIS ALL MEAN TO A CONSUMER LIKE YOU AND ME IMAGINE YOU ARE A PARENT OF AN INTELLIGENT PROMISING YOUNG MAN UNFORTUNATELY HIS STRICKEN BY MENTAL ILLNESS AT AGE TWENTY SIX NO DRUGS NO ALCOHOL QUALITY SHOULD HEAR THE PSYCHOTIC BREAK BECOME SUICIDAL AND IS TAKEN ON A FIFTY ONE FIFTY DUE TO LAWS YOUR CHILD IS PASSED BY A SOCIAL WORKER FROM A NONPROFIT PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL TO A FOR PROFIT REHAB TREATMENT FACILITY. YOU VALIDATE THE SOCIAL WORKERS ADVISED BY CHECKING OUT THE FACILITY'S WEBSITE IT CLAIMS TO HAVE THE PERFECT MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAM SPECIFICALLY FOR YOUNG ADULTS. LIKE BRANDON AS A PARENT THE AWFUL. OF MENTAL ILLNESS THE FIRST TIME YOU THIS IS AN AFTER RECALL. ALL THE RIGHT WE ARE AT THE PARA ON THE WEBSITE. THE PROGRAM PROVIDES A THERAPIST A PSYCHIATRIST PSYCHOLOGIST DAILY GROUP THERAPY AND MUCH NEEDED MEDICATION WHICH WAS PRESCRIBED. YOU THINK HOPE IS ON THE WAY WRONG. HOW WOULD YOU KNOW YOUR CHILD IS REALLY GOING TO A HOUSE RENTED BY THE TREATMENT FACILITY. THE HOUSE IS LOCATED IN A RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD IT IS NOT LIKE AND BECAUSE ONLY THE FACILITY HEADQUARTERS THIS LICENSE. IN THIS RESIDENTS HOUSE THERE ARE PROGRAMS NO PROFESSIONAL THERAPY NO PSYCHIATRIST NO PRESCRIBED MEDICATION. AND NO CONNECTION TO MUCH NEEDED FAMILY MEMBERS YOUR CHILD IS STRIPPED OF ITS BONE DRIVER'S LICENSE. THAT'S PART OF THEIR STAKE TREATMENT PLAN. IMAGINE THIS HAPPEN TO YOU BECAUSE THIS IS OUR SON STORY. OUR BELOVED SON BRANDON HUNG HIMSELF IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN AND ON LICENSE FOR PROFIT RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT HOUSE IN SAN CLEMENTE CALIFORNIA WHEN FOUND HIS BODY STILL WARM THE ON. LICENSE NON PROFESSIONAL HOUSE MANAGER CALLED NINE ONE ONE IN AN EFFORT TO SAVE HIM. THE HOUSE MANAGE YOUR GRANNY EVEN TELL NINE ONE ONE WHAT THE ADDRESS THEY WERE LOCATED WHAT HE DIDN'T KNOW BRANDON'S NAME IS AGE IT NOT ONLY PSYCHIATRIC BACKGROUND HE DIDN'T KNOW CPR IT WAS TOO LATE. OUR SON WAS GONE TOO SOON. I PRAY THAT ANOTHER FAMILY WILL NEVER EXPERIENCE AN AWFUL TRAGEDY LIKE ARE THE COMPANY OF UNIMAGINABLE. THERE CAN BE A SOLUTION SB FOUR THIRTY FOR BRANDON'S LAW PROVISION OF DEATHS THAT DECEPTIVE MARKETING PRACTICES. MUST PASS AND RETAIN YOU FOR YOUR AB.

TWELVE THIRTY TWO CLEANS UP IS PROBABLY NOT THE RIGHT WORD ENHANCES OR EXPANDS. THE IMPORTANT POLICY PURPOSE OF SB TWELVE THIRTY TWO WHICH ALLOWED QUALIFYING LOW INCOME STUDENT PARENTS. ENROLLED IN PUBLICLY FUNDED COLLEGES- TO THAT WERE WORKING PART OR FULL TIME TO RECEIVE CAL WORKS BENEFITS FOR UP TO FOUR YEARS. I ALSO RECEIVE FUNDS TO PURCHASE BOOKS PRIOR TO THE BEGINNING OF THE ACADEMIC TERM. THIS BILL EXPANDS TWELVE THIRTY TWO IN THE FOLLOWING WAYS. NUMBER ONE IT MAKES ELIGIBLE STUDENTS ENROLLED IN PRIVATE FOR A NOT FOR PROFIT INSTITUTIONS. NUMBER TWO IT CLARIFIES THAT ALL INSTRUCTIONAL HOURS INCLUDING INCLUDE SUMMER SESSION CLASSES. AND NUMBER THREE CLARIFIES THAT THE STUDENTS ARE NOT SUBJECT TO SELF INITIATED PROGRAM RULES. A COLLEGE EDUCATION IS EVEN MORE DIFFICULT TO ATTAIN FOR STUDENT PARENTS. ON CAL WORKS. AND THE COVERT NINETEEN PANDEMIC HAS ONLY EXACERBATED THOSE STRUGGLES AS PARENTS ARE FORCED TO JUGGLE WORKING ND STUDYING FROM HOME WHILE STILL PROVIDING CHILD CARE. STUDENT PARENTS ON CAL WORKS ARE OFTEN REQUIRED TO WORK AN ADDITIONAL TWENTY TO THIRTY HOURS TO RECEIVE FULL CAL WORKS OF BENEFITS. THE STUDENT ON CAL WORKS TO DOT MEET THEIR WORK OUR REQUIREMENTS. THEY COULD HAVE HAD THEIR BENEFITS REDUCED THIS EFFECTIVELY PUNISHED LOW INCOME PARENTS. WERE SEEKING A COLLEGE EDUCATION. IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT WE ENSURE ALL STUDENT PARENTS INCLUDING THOSE IN PRIVATE NOT FOR PROFIT INSTITUTIONS.

ONE ZERO EIGHT. SB ONE ZERO EIGHT DECLARES THAT THE ESTABLISHED POLICY OF CALIFORNIA THAT EVERY HUMAN BEING HAS THE RIGHT TO ACCESS EFFICIENT HELP YET AND AFFORDABLE FOOD. PRIOR TO THE COVERED NINETEEN PANDEMIC. IT WE HAD A FOOD INSECURITY WHICH WAS FURTHER WORSENED BY BY THIS PANDEMIC AND IT REALLY SHOWED ARBEL THE BILL OUR VULNERABILITIES VULNERABILITIES AND OUR FOOD SUPPLY CHAIN THE UNITED NATIONS FOOD AND AGRICULTURE ORGANIZATION ASSESSED AT JUST FIFTEEN CROP PLANTS PROVIDE 90% OF THE WORLD'S FOOD ENERGY INTAKE.

GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS BOSTON HERE TO PRESENT SB FOUR SIX FOUR SB FOUR SIX FOUR ALSO ADDRESSES FEEDING THE RESIDENTS OF OUR STATE IT WORKS TO ENSURE THERE IS GREATER EQUITY IN CALIFORNIA'S FOOD ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS PRIOR TO THE COVER NINETEEN PANDEMIC APPROXIMATELY ONE IN TEN CALIFORNIANS EXPERIENCE FOOD INSECURITY. THE PANDEMIC AND RESULTING ECONOMIC CRISIS HAS EXACERBATED FOOD INSECURITY ACROSS THE STATE. THE PARTICULARLY AMONG LOW WAGE IMMIGRANTS AND THEIR FAMILIES UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS DACA RECIPIENTS TEMPORARY PROTECTED STATUS HOLDERS AND CERTAIN VISA HOLDERS ARE EXCLUDED FROM FEDERAL CALFRESH AND ARE STATE FUNDED HEALTH CALIFORNIA FOOD ASSISTANCE PROGRAM. THESE EXCLUSIONS FORCED IMMIGRANT HOUSEHOLDS TO MAKE IMPOSSIBLE CHOICES BETWEEN BUYING GROCERIES AND COVERING THE COST OF RENT OR OTHER BASIC NEEDS. THIS LIMITS OUR ABILITY TO ACHIEVE ECONOMIC SECURITY AND UPWARD MOBILITY. SB FOUR SIX FOUR MODERNIZES THE CALIFORNIA FOOD ASSISTANCE PROGRAM EXPANDING ELIGIBILITY FOR STATE FUNDED NUTRITION BENEFITS TO ANYONE IN ELIGIBLE FOR CALFRESH TO SOLELY THEIR IMMIGRATION STATUS. IN DOING SO THE BILL PROVIDES GREATER FOOD SECURITY TOO LOW INCOME AND IMMIGRANT WORKERS HELPING LIFT THEM OUT OF POVERTY AS CATFISH IS PROVEN TO DO.

OKAY AND WE WILL BE CALLING UP OUR SENATOR RUBIO 2% ON SB SIX SEVEN EIGHT THIS AND RUBIO- PLEASE FEEL FREE TO BEGIN WHEN YOU'RE READY. AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. TODAY I PRESENT SENATE BILL SIX SEVENTY EIGHT WHICH IS AN IMPORTANT BILL THAT WILL MAKE CALIFORNIA THE FIRST STATE IN THE NATION TO FOCUS ON THE UNIQUE NEEDS OF UNACCOMPANIED WOMEN EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS THIS GROUP AS DEFINED BY FEDERAL RULES AS SINGLE WOMEN WITHOUT CHILDREN OR DEPENDENTS. DESPITE MAKING UP NEARLY ONE THIRD OF HOMELESS ADULTS NATIONWIDE THERE ARE NO PROGRAMS THAT FOCUS ON THEIR NEEDS AND EXPERIENCES ACCORDING TO FEDERAL DATA ON UNACCOMPANIED WOMEN EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS WEIGHTED AVERAGE OF TEN YEARS. TO HAVE ACCESS TO STABLE HOUSING IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT 80% OF THE EARTH OF THIS GROUP REPORTED TRAUMA OR ABUSED BY AN INTIMATE PARTNER. AS THE COST OF THEIR HOMELESSNESS SO WHEN PEOPLE ASK WHY DIDN'T SHE LEAVE BASIS HI FOR THE ANSWER. EITHER CONTINUE TO GET ABUSED OR POSSIBLY END UP HOMELESS SO IT'S NOT AN EASY CHOICE FOR WOMEN THE FIRST STEP TO SOLVING OUR HOMELESS PROBLEM IS HAVING ACCURATE DATA. ABOUT WHO IS ON HEALTH AND WHAT THEIR NEEDS ARE. AND THIS BILL DOES EXACTLY THAT SB SIX SEVEN EIGHT WILL REQUIRE THE STATE'S HOMELESS COORDINATING AND FINANCIAL COUNSEL TO COLLECT DATA ABOUT THIS GROUP FROM LOCAL CONTINUUM OF CARE. AND USES DATA TO HELP SET SPECIFIC MEASURABLE GOALS TO PREVENT AND END HOMELESSNESS. FOR THIS FORGOTTEN GROUP OF WOMEN. FINALLY THIS BILL COMPLIMENTS A RECENT AUDIT OF THE HOMELESS COORDINATED AND FINANCIAL COUNCIL THAT STATES THAT THE COUNCIL COULD BE MORE STRATEGIC AND MORE DATA DRIVEN. IN THEIR APPROACH TO SOLVING THE HOMELESS CRISIS THE SPONSORS IS DOWNTOWN WOMEN'S CENTER A HOMELESS SERVICE PROVIDER LOCATED AT LOS ANGELES SKID ROW. IT IS SUPPORTED BY A WIDE COALITION OF OVER TWENTY HOMELESS PROVIDERS AND COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS AND IT HAS NO OPPOSITION. IF I MAY I WOULD LIKE TO INTRODUCE MY- MY WITNESSES FIRST WE HAVE VICKY VICKERS A FORMER UNACCOMPANIED WOMEN EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS AND DR SOPHIA HERRERA THE DIRECTOR OF RESEARCH PLANNING AND POLICY AT THE HUB FOR URBAN INITIATIVES THANK YOU.

GOOD AFTERNOON SENATOR. MY NAME IS VICKY BAKER AND I'M A PURE LEADER WITH PROJECT ONE HUNDRED IN ALLEYS GET BRO AT THE DOWNTOWN WOMEN'S CENTER. I MEAN I THINK THEY GET AROUND HOW WOMEN. I'M HERE TODAY TO ASK YOU TO SUPPORT SB SIX SEVEN EIGHT. UNACCOMPANIED WOMEN EXPERIENCE HOMELESS THAT ACT OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE. I BELIEVE IN THIS BILL SO STRONGLY BECAUSE WOMEN NEED TO BE RECOGNIZED TO BE CARED. FOR IN TO BE SEEN FOR THE FOUR PEOPLE THAT THEY ARE. I MYSELF HOMELESS DUE TO GET. WHICH I WAS DIAGNOSED WITH AT THE AGE OF TWENTY. WHEN I RAN OUT OF MEDICATION I HAD SEVERE HALLUCINATIONS. I ENDED UP LEAVING EVERYTHING AND WOUND UP LIVING BEHIND AN OLD PARK IN SANTA MONICA. I WAS THERE FOR FOUR AND A HALF YEARS. LOCAL POLICE WOULD REGULARLY PASS BY THE PARK BUT BECAUSE I WASN'T CAUSING ANY ISSUE. IT SEEMS. AS IF THEY THOUGHT THEY WERE DOING ME A FAVOR I JUST LEADING ME THERE ALONE. IN THE PARK THERE WERE AND HOW THAT TREND THAT WOULD LOOK AFTER ME. BUT WHEN OTHER PEOPLE COME DOCTOR THROUGH IT OR OTHER ASSISTANCE I WOULD PUT MY HANDS IN FEAR. IT WAS ONLY AFTER I BECAME INCREDIBLY SICK AND FINALLY ACCEPTED SERVICES THAT I WAS ABLE TO REACH THE- MY ANTI PSYCHOTIC MEDICINE AND I WAS ABLE TO BEGIN THE PROCESS OF PUTTING MY LIFE BACK TOGETHER. NOW YEARS LATER I LIVE IN PERMANENT HOUSING AND I WORK TO HELP OTHER WOMEN OUT OF HOMELESSNESS. AND PUT THEM ON THEIR PATH TOWARDS PERSONAL ABILITY. TODAY THERE ARE OVER A HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND UNACCOMPANIED WOMEN. IN HOMELESSNESS WITHOUT CHILDREN OR OTHER DEPENDENTS ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND EVEN AS THE TOTAL NUMBER WOMEN CORRAN HOUSE RINGING TO FLAT MORE AND MORE WOMEN ARE FALLING INTO HOMELESSNESS BY THEMSELVES. SB SIX SEVENTY EIGHT WILL MAKE CALIFORNIA THE VERY FIRST STATE DESIGNATE UNACCOMPANIED WOMEN AS UNIQUE ALMOST POP SUBPOPULATION. AND TO RECOGNIZE THEY HAVE UNIQUE NEEDS AND CHALLENGES THAT MUST BE CLEARLY ADDRESS. WITH YOUR SUPPORT WE CAN MAKE CALIFORNIA A NATIONAL LEADER IN THE FIGHT AGAINST WOMEN TOLD. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND I HOPE THE U. BOAT YEAH IN FAVOR SB SIX SEVEN EIGHT THANK YOU. THANK YOU PREFER MOVING I JUST WANNA REMIND THAT WE WANT TO LIMIT AT TWO THREE MINUTES EACH FOR EACH THE WITNESS AND WILL BE MOVING ON TO LEAD. SUPPORT NUMBER TWO.

RECOGNIZING UNACCOMPANIED WOMEN AT THE TOP OF THE NATION'S FINANCIAL IN THE EFFORTS TO END AND PREVENT HOMELESSNESS. I SUCCESSFUL STRATEGY APPLIED BY THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION TO DECREASE THE NUMBERS COME ON A HOUSE THAT ORANGE WASHED TO PRECISELY IDENTIFY THEM AT THE SPECIFIC SUBPOPULATIONS WOULDN'T THINK NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED BUT PART OF. THE SERVICES AND CARE THAT THEY NEED. IN PENSION AND THE HAS. IN A FEW PERCENT DECREASE NATIONALLY IN BETTER INCOME. BY CALLING OUT UNACCOMPANIED WOMEN CALIFORNIA HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO UNDERSCORE THE ABSOLUTE NEED FOR TRAUMA INFORMED DEFINING CARE IN ENGAGEMENT SEPARATE SERVICE DELIVERY IN HOUSING PROGRAM SERVING AT A COMPANY NAY MAY NEED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE RANGE OF THEIR TRAUMATIC EXPERIENCES WHILE LIVING ON THE STREETS PARTICULARLY VICTIMIZATION IN THE FALL. AND THE IMPACT OF THOSEDRAMATIC EXPERIENCES IN WOMEN'S LIVES WHEN WOMEN DO NOT FEEL SAFE THEY DO NOT TRUST INSTITUTION THE BALANCE FROM ONE SERVICE AGENCIES MY MOTHER IT WILL NOT PROVIDE ACCURATE INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR NEEDS A PERSONAL STORY WHICH IS CRITICAL FOR MAKING THAT INFORMED DECISION. LASTLY TO END HOMELESSNESS AMONG UNACCOMPANIED WOMEN WE ALSO NEED TO MAKE EVIDENCE INFORMED DEFICIENCY CONSUMER IMPLEMENTATION THEREFORE INCLUDING UNACCOMPANIED WOMEN AT THE TOP OF THE NATION'S NEWLY ESTABLISHED HOMELESSNESS DATA INTEGRATION SYSTEM BY THE STATE WILL HELP TO. ESTABLISH INFLOW IN ALCOA PATTERNS IN HOMELESS AND OTHER SYSTEM CONSERVANCY DEVELOP A FRAMEWORK THAT CAN HELP THE STATE UNDERSTAND THE NEEDS OF WOMEN STATEWIDE AND BY REGION.

ON HOW TO CARE FOR FOSTER YOUTH WHO ARE AT RISK OF EXPERIENCING CHILD LABOR TRAFFICKING CURRENTLY RESOURCE FAMILIES ARE REQUIRED ONLY TO BE TRAINED ON CHILDREN AT RISK OF SEX TRAFFICKING. HOWEVER NUMEROUS REPORTS HIGHLIGHT THAT FOSTER YOUTH ARE AT A DISPROPORTIONATE RISK OF CHILD LABOR TRAFFICKING ONE STUDY FOUND THAT YOUTH WHO HAVE A HISTORY IN THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM ACCOUNT 426% OF ALL YOUTH. WHO HAVE BEEN LABOR TRAFFICKED FOSTER PARENTS MUST BE PROVIDED WITH COMPREHENSIVE TRAINING THAT FOCUSES ON THE DIVERSE NEEDS OF OUR FOSTER YOUTH INCLUDING THE PREVENTION OF CHILD LABOR TRAFFICKING AND I SHOULD HAVE ONE AND POSSIBLY TWO WITNESSES IN SUPPORT ON THE TELECONFERENCE LINE. WE WILL NOT OPEN IT UP TO WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OF POSITIONALLY WITNESSES SUPPORT OPPOSITION WILL BE LIMITED TO THREE MINUTES. AND WE HERE TO TESTIFY WE HAVE LEAD SUPPORT NUMBER ONE. FORMER ASSEMBLYMEMBER PEDRO NAVA THE LITTLE HOOVER COMMISSION AND NEED SUPPORT NUMBER TWO JAMELIA HINES OF THE SURVIVOR OF CHILD LABOR TRAFFICKING. ARE THEY AVAILABLE. YUP I'M AVAILABLE CAN YOU HEAR ME YES PLEASE FEEL FREE TO BEGIN WHEN YOU'RE READY THANK YOU OKAY. WONDERFUL THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY BOB GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS. MY NAME IS PEDRO NAVA AND I'M THE CHAIRMAN OF THE LITTLE HOOVER COMMISSION HERE TODAY IN SUPPORT OF SB FIVE EIGHTY FOUR. THE COMMISSION IS AN INDEPENDENT BIPARTISAN OVERSIGHT AGENCY CHARGED WITH MAKING RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE GOVERNOR AND THE LEGISLATURE. TO IMPROVE THE EFFICIENCY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF STATE GOVERNMENT. LAST YEAR WE ISSUED A SERIES OF THREE REPORTS EXAMINING THE STATE'S RESPONSE TO LABOR TRAFFICKING EVERYTHING FORM OF MODERN SLAVERY BUT EXPLOITS INNOCENT WORKERS THROUGH FORCE FRAUD OR COERCION. OFTEN VICTIMS ARE TRAPPED IN A PRESS OF SITUATIONS OUR DECISION TO FOCUS ON LABOR TRAFFICKING STEM FROM THE FACT. THAT EXISTING EFFORTS TO COMBAT HUMAN TRAFFICKING PRIMARILY FOCUSED ON SEX TRAFFICKING SO MANY EXPERTS SUGGEST LABOR TRAFFICKING IS MORE PREVALENT. LABOR TRAFFICKING IS A SINISTER CRIME BUT IT CAN BE DIFFICULT TO DETECT YOU CAN BE HIDDEN IN PLAIN SIGHT CLUB AND WITHIN BUSINESSES OR INDUSTRIES. THAT MIGHT OTHERWISE BE LEGITIMATE. TRAFFICKERS PREY ON THE MOST VULNERABLE AMONG US REGARDLESS OF GENDER AGE OR CITIZENSHIP STATUS. AND RESEARCH SUGGESTS THAT RUNAWAY AND HOMELESS YOUTH AS WELL AS FOSTER CHILDREN ARE PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE TO THIS EXPLOITATION. YEAH CALIFORNIA'S PROTECTIONS FOR CHILD VICTIMS OF LABOR TRAFFICKING ARSON. IN A REPORT ENTITLED LABOR TRAFFICKING STRATEGIES TO UNCOVER THIS HIDDEN CRIME. WE FOUND THAT EXISTING LAWS FOCUS FAR MORE ON SEX TRAFFICKING. COMBATING SEX TRAFFICKING IS ABSOLUTELY VITAL AND MUST CONTINUE BUT IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT WE TARGET LABOR TRAFFICKING JUST AS AGGRESSIVELY. EXISTING PROTECTIONS FOR CHILD VICTIMS OF SEX TRAFFICKING PROVIDED STRONG FOUNDATION UPON WHICH TO BUILD. IN OUR REPORT WE URGE LAWMAKERS TO UPDATE THOSE PROJECTIONS. THAT THEY ALSO PROTECT CHILDREN WHO ARE EXPLOITED FOR LABOR. THIS WILL ENSURE THAT CHILD VICTIMS OF ALL TYPES OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING ARE PROTECTED UNDER CALIFORNIA LAW. SB FIVE EIGHTY FOUR WOULD ADVANCE THE COMMISSION'S RECOMMENDATION BY REQUIRING THAT RESOURCE FAMILY TRAINING INCLUDE. CHILD LABOR TRAFFICKING EDUCATION IN ADDITION TO EXISTING REQUIREMENTS FOR CHILD SEX TRAFFICKING EDUCATION. I'LL BE OUT THE LITTLE HOOVER COMMISSION I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR AYE VOTE AND THANK.
