00:09:55.895 --> 00:09:57.563
REFORMATION OR GASIFICATION TO

00:09:57.630 --> 00:10:00.800
PRODUCE HYDROGEN. AND THE OTHER

00:10:00.866 --> 00:10:02.835
BENEFITS OF HYDROGEN IS THAT IT

00:10:02.902 --> 00:10:04.603
CAN DECARBONISE DIFFICULT

00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:07.306
SECTORS LIKE SHIPPING LONG HAUL

00:10:07.373 --> 00:10:11.310
TRUCKING AIR TRAVEL SO MUCH AND

00:10:11.377 --> 00:10:12.144
BECAUSE IT COULD POTENTIALLY

00:10:12.211 --> 00:10:16.282
USE EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE IT

00:10:16.349 --> 00:10:18.084
PRESERVES WELL PAYING JOBS.

00:10:18.150 --> 00:10:20.086
WHAT SB EIGHTEEN SPECIFICALLY

00:10:20.152 --> 00:10:22.755
DOES IS IT VANCE'S GREEN

00:10:22.822 --> 00:10:25.191
HYDROGEN BY ESTABLISHING A

00:10:25.257 --> 00:10:26.859

VALLEY COMMUNITIES AND IN FACT

00:30:33.198 --> 00:30:35.133
ARE MORE LIKELY TO EXACERBATE

00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:36.434
THOSE IMPACTS BY ENCOURAGING

AVAILABLE- ALL OUT THROUGHOUT

00:31:22.847 --> 00:31:24.849
CALIFORNIA- AND I THINK IT'S A

00:31:24.916 --> 00:31:26.517
IT'S A BETTER TRANSITION ENERGY

00:31:26.584 --> 00:31:28.920
THAN BATTERIES QUITE FRANKLY

00:31:28.987 --> 00:31:30.822
HYDROGEN PUTS OUT WATER. WHEN

00:31:30.888 --> 00:31:32.824
IT'S WHEN IT'S USED FOR FUEL

00:31:32.890 --> 00:31:34.492
AND- WE DON'T HAVE TO WORRY

00:31:34.559 --> 00:31:35.560
ABOUT WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO WITH

00:31:35.627 --> 00:31:36.594
ALL THE BATTERIES AFTER WE GET

00:31:36.661 --> 00:31:38.529
DONE SO I'M SUPER EXCITED ABOUT

00:31:38.596 --> 00:31:40.298
THIS BILL I DO HAVE A QUESTION

00:31:40.365 --> 00:31:42.333
OF THE AUTHOR THOUGH- CAN YOU

00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:43.768
COULD PLEASE CLARIFY. FOR THE

00:31:43.835 --> 00:31:44.869
RECORD AND THAT IS WOODY

00:31:44.936 --> 00:31:47.005
BIOMASS PART OF THIS GREEN

00:31:47.071 --> 00:31:50.041
ENERGY- GREEN GREEN HYDROGEN I

00:31:50.108 --> 00:31:53.978
SHOULD SAY- THROUGH THE CHAIR

00:31:54.045 --> 00:31:56.681
THE CIRCUIT. YES OKAY THANK YOU

00:31:56.748 --> 00:31:57.882
REALLY APPRECIATE THE QUESTION

00:31:57.949 --> 00:32:01.185
SO IN THE ANALYSIS YOU WILL

00:32:01.252 --> 00:32:08.893
NOTE THAT THE- THERE IS A

00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:11.596
DISCUSSION ABOUT THESE NOTIONS

00:32:11.663 --> 00:32:14.098
OF KERKORIAN'S MEDIA GET THE

00:32:14.165 --> 00:32:15.933
ROOM TO BE WAS A TURQUOISE BUT

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:16.701
SOMETHING LIKE THAT BLUE

00:32:16.768 --> 00:32:20.238
HYDROGEN AGREE NITROGEN THESE

00:32:20.305 --> 00:32:22.573
VARIOUS- THEY'RE NOT IN

00:32:22.640 --> 00:32:26.311
STATUTES YET BUT- AS I

00:32:26.377 --> 00:32:27.712
INDICATED BEFORE THE ONLY THING

00:32:27.779 --> 00:32:29.881
WE HAVE IN STATUTES YET A FOR A

00:32:29.947 --> 00:32:30.882
DEFINITION IS GREEN

00:32:30.948 --> 00:32:32.750
ELECTROLYTIC HYDROGEN SO WHAT

00:32:32.817 --> 00:32:34.619
I'M TRYING TO DO HERE. IS

00:32:34.686 --> 00:32:36.554
CREATING DEFINITION FOR ANY

00:32:36.621 --> 00:32:38.356
HYDROGEN PRODUCED BY KNOWN

00:32:38.423 --> 00:32:40.658
FOSSIL FUEL FEEDSTOCKS SO THAT

00:32:40.725 --> 00:32:41.793
OF COURSE WOULD INCLUDE WOODY

00:32:41.859 --> 00:32:43.995
BIOMASS NOW AS YOU HEARD FROM

00:32:44.062 --> 00:32:46.831
SOME OF THE SCREENERS THERE

00:32:46.898 --> 00:32:49.367
THEY HAVE A CONCERN THAT-

00:32:49.434 --> 00:32:51.135
PERHAPS THE DEFINITION WOULD BE

00:32:51.202 --> 00:32:52.070
WRITTEN IN SUCH A WAY THAT

00:32:52.136 --> 00:32:53.404
WOULD EXCLUDE IT THAT'S

00:32:53.471 --> 00:32:55.173
CERTAINLY NOT MY INTENTION

00:32:55.239 --> 00:32:59.377
THOUGH- CLEARLY THERE'S STILL-

00:32:59.444 --> 00:33:00.712
DISCUSSIONS TO BE HAD WITH

00:33:00.778 --> 00:33:02.447
STAKEHOLDERS BUT AT THE MOMENT.

00:33:02.513 --> 00:33:05.149
I VIEW THE WOODY BIOMASS AS A

00:33:05.216 --> 00:33:07.485
NON FOSSIL FUEL SOURCE AND

00:33:07.552 --> 00:33:10.922
SHOULD BE ONE OF THE FEEDSTOCKS

00:33:10.988 --> 00:33:14.926
FOR GREEN HYDROGEN. THANK YOU

00:33:14.992 --> 00:33:16.227
FOR THAT CLARIFICATION I'M

00:33:16.294 --> 00:33:18.262
SUPER EXCITED TO HEAR THAT. I

00:33:18.329 --> 00:33:19.864
JUST WANTED IT ALSO JUST FOR

00:33:19.931 --> 00:33:21.833
THE RECORD SAY. THAT WE'VE HAD

00:33:21.899 --> 00:33:24.902
MILLIONS OF TREES BURN OUT AND

00:33:24.969 --> 00:33:26.337
WHEN THEY DECAY THERE PUTTING

00:33:26.404 --> 00:33:28.039
UP NOTHING WHICH IS A POISONOUS

00:33:28.106 --> 00:33:30.942
GAS- WE CAN USE THOSE TO CREATE

00:33:31.008 --> 00:33:32.377
HYDROGEN WHICH IS A CLEAN FUEL

00:33:32.443 --> 00:33:34.045
SO. I WILL BE SUPPORTING YOUR

00:33:34.112 --> 00:33:35.346
LEGISLATION DAY AND I LOOK

00:33:35.413 --> 00:33:37.181
FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU. ON

00:33:37.248 --> 00:33:38.783
SOMETHING THAT'S SUPER EXCITING

00:33:38.850 --> 00:33:40.451
I THINK FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO

00:33:40.518 --> 00:33:41.586
ACTUALLY FINALLY BE MOVING

00:33:41.652 --> 00:33:43.321
FORWARD ON AN ENERGY THAT'S

00:33:43.388 --> 00:33:45.423
TRULY CLEAN- WHEN WE HAVE

00:33:45.490 --> 00:33:46.891
EXCESS ELECTRICITY TO MAKE IT

00:33:46.958 --> 00:33:48.459
SO I APPRECIATE THAT. AND I

00:33:48.526 --> 00:33:52.363
LOOK FORWARD TO- WATCHING THIS

00:33:52.430 --> 00:33:52.964

WHO COMMUTES BACK AND FORTH

00:33:59.904 --> 00:34:01.672
EVERY DAY GARCIA MY ELECTRIC

00:34:01.739 --> 00:34:03.975
CHARGE- BUT I GO TO AG LAND AND

00:34:04.041 --> 00:34:05.743
STILL SEE ALL KINDS OF- OPEN

00:34:05.810 --> 00:34:06.844
BURNS AND WE KNOW THAT THERE'S

00:34:06.911 --> 00:34:08.246
ALL KIND OF ORGANIC WASTE OUT

00:34:08.312 --> 00:34:10.381
IN OUR FIELD AND- BEING

00:34:10.448 --> 00:34:11.616
PRODUCED AT OUR DAIRIES AND

00:34:11.682 --> 00:34:12.784
EVERYWHERE ELSE AND IT'S

00:34:12.850 --> 00:34:13.584
ALREADY THERE WHEN I TOOK MY

00:34:13.651 --> 00:34:15.586
PRODUCING NEW IT IS THERE IT

00:34:15.653 --> 00:34:17.221
NEEDS TO BE DEALT WITH AND IF

00:34:17.288 --> 00:34:18.156
WE DON'T DEAL WITH IT IN A

00:34:18.222 --> 00:34:20.291
CLEAN WAY AND THEN WE JUST

00:34:20.358 --> 00:34:20.892
CONTINUE TO ADD TO THE TO THE

00:34:20.958 --> 00:34:22.894
WASTE. SO FOR ME THIS JUST HITS

00:34:22.960 --> 00:34:25.229
ALL I MEAN CREATING MORE ENERGY

00:34:25.296 --> 00:34:26.898
AND YOU AND WE CAN STORE IT

00:34:26.964 --> 00:34:28.733
ANOTHER HUGE ISSUE AND WE CAN

00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:30.601
ALSO USE WHAT'S ALREADY IN OUR

00:34:30.668 --> 00:34:32.570
ENVIRONMENT THAT WE USE- FOR

00:34:32.637 --> 00:34:33.738
ALL OTHER PARTS OF OUR ECONOMY

00:34:33.805 --> 00:34:35.606
AND OUR ENVIRONMENT SO I'M ALSO

00:34:35.673 --> 00:34:37.008
VERY EXCITED ABOUT THIS AND

00:34:37.074 --> 00:34:40.445
LOVE. TO BE A CO AUTHOR WHEN

00:34:40.511 --> 00:34:41.379
THE TIME IS RIGHT. SENATE

00:34:41.446 --> 00:34:44.849
HERTZBERG ONES. I DID. THINK

00:34:44.916 --> 00:34:47.318
MISTREATMENT. I JUST WANT TO

00:34:47.385 --> 00:34:49.187
PUT THIS DISCUSSION IN A LARGER

00:34:49.253 --> 00:34:52.056
CONTEXT FROM. MY EXPERIENCE IN

00:34:52.123 --> 00:34:56.093
LIFE AND YOU KNOW WE TRY IS

00:34:56.160 --> 00:34:56.928
HUMAN BEINGS TO COME UP WITH

00:34:56.994 --> 00:34:59.597
NEW WAYS. TO CREATE ENERGY VERY

00:34:59.664 --> 00:35:01.232
SORTS WHEN THE AUTOMOBILE WAS

00:35:01.299 --> 00:35:03.634
FIRST INTRODUCED FOR THE FIRST

00:35:03.701 --> 00:35:05.102
FOURTEEN YEARS 80% OF THE CARS

00:35:05.169 --> 00:35:07.305
WERE STEAM ENGINES. AND IT

00:35:07.371 --> 00:35:09.674
SHIFTED TO THIS INTERNAL

00:35:09.740 --> 00:35:11.576
COMBUSTION ENGINE FOR WHATEVER

00:35:11.642 --> 00:35:13.010
POLITICAL OR OTHER REASONS

00:35:13.077 --> 00:35:15.213
CERTAINLY WATER WAS A LOT

00:35:15.279 --> 00:35:17.215
CHEAPER THAN OIL AT THE TIME.

00:35:17.281 --> 00:35:19.016
AND WE HAVE BEEN DEALING WITH

00:35:19.083 --> 00:35:20.618
FOR THE LAST MANY YEARS A

00:35:20.685 --> 00:35:23.721
SERIES OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES. TO

00:35:23.788 --> 00:35:24.856
TRY TO COME UP WITH THE

00:35:24.922 --> 00:35:26.824
ULTIMATE PERPETUAL ENERGY IN A

00:35:26.891 --> 00:35:29.360
BIGGER THINK ABOUT WHAT WE'RE

00:35:29.427 --> 00:35:31.496
TRYING TO DO. THE MALDIVES HAVE

00:35:31.562 --> 00:35:33.264
A RELIABLE ENERGY STANDARD

00:35:33.331 --> 00:35:34.799
PORTS FULLY INSTEAD OF A 100%

00:35:34.866 --> 00:35:36.167
BECAUSE THEY INTEGRATE ALL

00:35:36.234 --> 00:35:38.102
THEIR VARIOUS TECHNOLOGIES. I

00:35:38.169 --> 00:35:40.638
AGREE WITH- THE COMMENT MADE

00:35:40.705 --> 00:35:42.807
EARLIER ABOUT BATTERIES. SO

00:35:42.874 --> 00:35:44.275
MUCH OF WHAT WE DO I MEAN

00:35:44.342 --> 00:35:45.510
BATTERIES ARE HEAVY METAL

00:35:45.576 --> 00:35:46.811
THEY'RE GOING TO GO INTO TO

00:35:46.878 --> 00:35:48.446
LANDFILLS THEY'VE GOT ALL SORTS

00:35:48.513 --> 00:35:51.082
OF CONSEQUENCES FOR. EVEN SOLAR

00:35:51.148 --> 00:35:52.750
EIGHT YEAR ENERGY PAY BACK

00:35:52.817 --> 00:35:54.886
ANYTHING THAT WE CAN DO TO GO

00:35:54.952 --> 00:35:56.420
WITH NEW AND CREATIVE WAYS

00:35:56.487 --> 00:35:58.055
THERE PEOPLE ARE ALWAYS GOING

00:35:58.122 --> 00:35:59.790
TO BELLY ACHE ABOUT. WHERE WE

00:35:59.857 --> 00:36:02.126
ARE BUT WE ARE AS A LEGISLATURE

00:36:02.193 --> 00:36:03.961
IS WE ALWAYS INVENTED WE CREATE

00:36:04.028 --> 00:36:06.030
COME UP WITH NEW IDEAS. THIS IS

00:36:06.097 --> 00:36:06.864
A FRAMEWORK LOOK AT

00:36:06.931 --> 00:36:09.367
ELECTROLYSIS WILL FURTHER

00:36:09.433 --> 00:36:10.835
REFINE THIS DEFINITION

00:36:10.902 --> 00:36:12.069
EVERYBODY'S AND THINGS WE HAVE

00:36:12.136 --> 00:36:13.337
TO DEAL WITH IT I THINK IT'S

00:36:13.404 --> 00:36:14.906
GOING TO CREATE A LOT OF JOBS.

00:36:14.972 --> 00:36:16.007
I THINK IT'S GOING TO REALLY

00:36:16.073 --> 00:36:17.475
MOVE US TO A MUCH MORE

00:36:17.542 --> 00:36:19.810
INTELLIGENT APPROACH. TO ENERGY

00:36:19.877 --> 00:36:21.245
PRODUCTION AS PART OF AN

00:36:21.312 --> 00:36:22.513
INTEGRATED PACKAGE OF

00:36:22.580 --> 00:36:24.148
EVERYTHING WE DO THE ENERGY

00:36:24.215 --> 00:36:26.284
CRISIS THAT WE HAD. WAS NOT

00:36:26.350 --> 00:36:27.785
JUST A CRISIS ABOUT THE LIGHTS

00:36:27.852 --> 00:36:29.754
GOING OUT BUT WAS A CRISIS THAT

00:36:29.820 --> 00:36:31.722
A VERY SMALL GROUP OF COMPANIES

00:36:31.789 --> 00:36:33.858
HAD TOTAL CONTROL OVER OUR

00:36:33.925 --> 00:36:35.826
ENERGY PRODUCTION. AND WE HAVE

00:36:35.893 --> 00:36:37.495
BEEN GRAPPLING WITH WHETHER

00:36:37.562 --> 00:36:38.996
IT'S THE RESOURCE ADEQUACY

00:36:39.063 --> 00:36:41.899
POLAR. ALL SORTS OF WAYS TO

00:36:41.966 --> 00:36:45.937
DEAL WITH HOW TO CONVERT. OUR

00:36:46.003 --> 00:36:48.306
SOURCE OF ENERGY AND SO I THIS

00:36:48.372 --> 00:36:50.575
IS A VERY CREATIVE AREA THE

00:36:50.641 --> 00:36:52.043
TECHNOLOGY IS CHANGING

00:36:52.109 --> 00:36:54.011
DRAMATICALLY. AND IT IS JUST

00:36:54.078 --> 00:36:55.913
ANOTHER STEP OF THE KIND OF

00:36:55.980 --> 00:36:57.114
APPROACH THAT THIS COMMITTEE

00:36:57.181 --> 00:36:58.015
NEEDS TO TAKE IN THIS

00:36:58.082 --> 00:36:59.383
LEGISLATURE THIS GOVERNMENT

00:36:59.450 --> 00:37:01.686
NEEDS TO TAKE. TO INVENT THE

00:37:01.752 --> 00:37:03.287
FUTURE ASK FOR SUPPORT THIS

00:37:03.354 --> 00:37:08.626
MEASURE THANK YOU THE CENTER.

00:37:08.693 --> 00:37:09.260
BRADFORD DID YOU HAVE YOUR MAKE

00:37:09.327 --> 00:37:10.094
UP. THE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR.

00:37:10.161 --> 00:37:10.861
AND THANK YOU TO THE FOR

00:37:10.928 --> 00:37:12.096
BRINGING THE COMMENTS MEASURE

00:37:12.163 --> 00:37:14.365
BUT- I DO HAVE CONCERNS AND IT

00:37:14.432 --> 00:37:15.666
HAS TO DO WITH THE ROLE THAT

00:37:15.733 --> 00:37:17.802
CAR WILL PLAY AND I THINK WE

00:37:17.868 --> 00:37:19.203
ALL SHOULD BE CONCERNED BASED

00:37:19.270 --> 00:37:21.272
ON THE RECENT AUTHOR. OF CARBS

00:37:21.339 --> 00:37:24.508
IN ABILITY TO. REALLY MONITOR

00:37:24.575 --> 00:37:25.810
ANY OF THESE PROGRAMS THAT

00:37:25.876 --> 00:37:27.445
THEY'VE BEEN TASKED WITH THE

00:37:27.511 --> 00:37:28.913
COME BACK WITH FEASIBLE WAYS

00:37:28.980 --> 00:37:31.849
OF. HOW TO BEST SPEND DOLLARS

00:37:31.916 --> 00:37:33.851
IN IT AND EVEN THE AUDIT SAYS.

00:37:33.918 --> 00:37:35.219
THEIR THEIR PRACTICES ARE

00:37:35.286 --> 00:37:38.222
INDEFENSIBLE AND TO CONTINUE TO

00:37:38.289 --> 00:37:40.491
ALLOW CAR TO DETERMINE WHAT'S

00:37:40.558 --> 00:37:42.827
BEST FOR LOW INCOME. OR

00:37:42.893 --> 00:37:44.996
MINORITY COMMUNITIES IS TOTALLY

00:37:45.062 --> 00:37:46.597
LAUGHABLE I ONLY WISH THERE WAS

00:37:46.664 --> 00:37:48.399
ANOTHER AGENCY WHO WOULD BE

00:37:48.466 --> 00:37:49.700
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SCOPING

00:37:49.767 --> 00:37:51.202
PLAN. AND COMING BACK WITH

00:37:51.268 --> 00:37:52.637
FEASIBLE PLANTS ARE REALLY

00:37:52.703 --> 00:37:54.138
ADDRESS WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO

00:37:54.205 --> 00:37:55.873
HERE BECAUSE THEY ARE TRAINABLE

00:37:55.940 --> 00:37:57.174
BUT CARPETS CLEARLY

00:37:57.241 --> 00:38:00.845
DEMONSTRATED. THEY'RE NOT THE

00:38:00.911 --> 00:38:02.346
AGENCY TO BE IN CHARGE OF THIS.

00:38:02.413 --> 00:38:03.981
THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANYONE ELSE

00:38:04.048 --> 00:38:06.350
IN THE COMMITTEE- CENTER

00:38:06.417 --> 00:38:13.057
CERTAIN. THANKS RICHER-

00:38:13.124 --> 00:38:15.426
APPRECIATE THE BILL AND GETTING

00:38:15.493 --> 00:38:17.194
OUT AHEAD OF THIS IF I THINK IS

00:38:17.261 --> 00:38:18.329
A REALLY SMART APPROACH JUST.

00:38:18.396 --> 00:38:21.232
GIVEN ALL THE RESEARCH AND

00:38:21.298 --> 00:38:22.867
DEVELOPMENT IN NEW ACTIVITY IN

00:38:22.933 --> 00:38:24.435
THIS ARENA I THINK IT'S

00:38:24.502 --> 00:38:26.404
IMPORTANT TO PUT SOME

00:38:26.470 --> 00:38:29.040
GUARDRAILS IN PLACE- SO I THINK

00:38:29.106 --> 00:38:31.742
THE BILL SMART IN THAT WAY- I'M

00:38:31.809 --> 00:38:33.077
JUST HOPING THE AUTHOR CAN YOU

00:38:33.144 --> 00:38:34.712
JUST DRILL DOWN A LITTLE BIT I

00:38:34.779 --> 00:38:36.781
KNOW WOODY BIOMASS WAS BROUGHT

00:38:36.847 --> 00:38:41.118
UP BUT- THE CONCERNS RAISED BY-

00:38:41.185 --> 00:38:42.186
SOME OF THE TWEETERS. ABOUT

00:38:42.253 --> 00:38:43.320
SORT OF THE LIKE WHAT

00:38:43.387 --> 00:38:44.555
ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS ARE

00:38:44.622 --> 00:38:45.756
GOING TO BE AROUND THE VARIOUS

00:38:45.823 --> 00:38:47.558
FEEDSTOCKS SO I WOULD IMAGINE

00:38:47.625 --> 00:38:48.459
FOR INSTANCE A LIKE. WOODY

00:38:48.526 --> 00:38:50.528
BIOMASS TAKEN OUT OF OUR

00:38:50.594 --> 00:38:52.396
PROJECTS THAT'S NOT SUSTAINABLY

00:38:52.463 --> 00:38:54.331
HARVESTED WOULD NOT BE ELIGIBLE

00:38:54.398 --> 00:38:57.401
OR- THAT THERE'S ACT BIOMASS

00:38:57.468 --> 00:38:58.469
FOR INSTANCE THAT WE YOU KNOW

00:38:58.536 --> 00:39:00.304
DIDN'T COMPLY WITH THE LOCAL

00:39:00.371 --> 00:39:02.306
AIR DISTRICTS ALIKE JUST HOW TO.

00:39:02.373 --> 00:39:04.575
HOW TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE.

00:39:04.642 --> 00:39:05.409
EVEN ON THE DAIRY IN THE

00:39:05.476 --> 00:39:07.611
METHANE FRIEND I KNOW THAT'S A

00:39:07.678 --> 00:39:08.212
BIG ISSUE CAN YOU JUST TALK

00:39:08.279 --> 00:39:09.880
THROUGH. AND HE'S TRYING TO

00:39:09.947 --> 00:39:11.115
STAY HIGH LEVEL BUT HOW TO

00:39:11.182 --> 00:39:14.485
NAVIGATE ALL THE SORT OF ISSUES.

00:39:14.552 --> 00:39:15.720
THE CHAIR THEY HAVE BEEN

00:39:15.786 --> 00:39:18.422
ANSWERED. SO YOU KNOW THESE ARE

00:39:18.489 --> 00:39:20.691
IT'S LIKE SO MANY THINGS. DO WE

00:39:20.758 --> 00:39:23.127
LOOK TO ONE STATUTE. TO TAKE

00:39:23.194 --> 00:39:24.395
CARE OF ALL PROBLEMS NOT

00:39:24.462 --> 00:39:27.064
NECESSARILY. AND CERTAINLY WHEN

00:39:27.131 --> 00:39:29.266
IT COMES TO ITS TAKES

00:39:29.333 --> 00:39:31.502
SUSTAINABLE FORESTRY PRACTICES.

00:39:31.569 --> 00:39:33.771
WE'RE GOING TO NEED. OUR

00:39:33.838 --> 00:39:36.407
EXISTING STATUTES ENFORCED. FOR

00:39:36.474 --> 00:39:38.109
BOARD POTENTIALLY NEW TO MAKE

00:39:38.175 --> 00:39:40.411
SURE THAT WE ARE HARVESTING

00:39:40.478 --> 00:39:43.481
MANAGING MAINTAINING OUR FOR

00:39:43.547 --> 00:39:46.250
SUSTAINABLY. AND TO BURDEN OUR

00:39:46.317 --> 00:39:48.219
DEFINITION OF GREEN HYDROGEN ON

00:39:48.285 --> 00:39:50.821
WHETHER OR NOT THAT PRACTICE

00:39:50.888 --> 00:39:53.290
WAS MET IT'S NOT A FAIR BURDEN.

00:39:53.357 --> 00:39:55.126
AND WHAT I WOULD SAY IS THAT.

00:39:55.192 --> 00:39:57.194
WHILE I APPRECIATE THERE'S A

00:39:57.261 --> 00:40:00.164
CONCERN THAT IF WE FOR EXAMPLE

00:40:00.231 --> 00:40:04.101
ALLOW FOR- WOODY BIOMASS

00:40:04.168 --> 00:40:06.070
GASIFICATION THAT THERE'S OTHER

00:40:06.137 --> 00:40:07.538
POLLUTANTS THAT COULD EMERGE.

00:40:07.605 --> 00:40:09.039
AND YES THAT IS POTENTIAL

00:40:09.106 --> 00:40:13.277
HOWEVER. HI TO CHEN HAS LEAGUE

00:40:13.344 --> 00:40:14.912
REDUCE POTENTIAL FOR SOME OF

00:40:14.979 --> 00:40:16.580
THE MOST NORTHERLY PROBLEMS WE

00:40:16.647 --> 00:40:18.682
HAVE LONG HILLS LONG HAUL

00:40:18.749 --> 00:40:22.553
TRUCKING. DIESEL POLLUTION IS

00:40:22.620 --> 00:40:25.156
NOT ONLY DETRIMENTAL FROM A

00:40:25.222 --> 00:40:26.857
CLIMATE PREVIEWS IT IS KILLING

00:40:26.924 --> 00:40:29.059
PEOPLE IT IS KILLING

00:40:29.126 --> 00:40:33.130
CALIFORNIANS NOW IT IS THE

00:40:33.197 --> 00:40:35.566
SINGLE LARGEST FOREIGN SOURCE

00:40:35.633 --> 00:40:38.369
OF SO MANY POLLUTANTS THAT ARE

00:40:38.435 --> 00:40:39.670
CREATING ALL KINDS OF HEALTH

00:40:39.737 --> 00:40:43.507
IMPACTS AND SO TO LOOK AT THE

00:40:43.574 --> 00:40:45.810
POTENTIAL FOR NOW I CERTAINLY

00:40:45.876 --> 00:40:48.612
DON'T AND I MY BILL DOESN'T

00:40:48.679 --> 00:40:50.214
ADVOCATE THAT WE CONVERT ALL

00:40:50.281 --> 00:40:52.817
LONG HAUL TRUCKS TO HYDROGEN

00:40:52.883 --> 00:40:54.819
THAT WAS PRODUCED USING FOSSIL

00:40:54.885 --> 00:40:58.489
FUELS NO THAT'S NOT SMART.

00:40:58.556 --> 00:41:00.691
HOWEVER IF WE ARE UTILIZING

00:41:00.758 --> 00:41:03.727
BIOMASS AND WHILE I WANT TO

00:41:03.794 --> 00:41:06.697
AVOID ANY OTHER POLLUTANTS AS A

00:41:06.764 --> 00:41:08.132
RESULT OF IT AND I THINK WE

00:41:08.199 --> 00:41:09.600
SHOULD NEED TO TIGHTEN UP RULES

00:41:09.667 --> 00:41:11.402
AROUND BIOMASS AND SUCH I DO

00:41:11.468 --> 00:41:13.237
NOT WANT TO EXCLUDE HYDROGEN

00:41:13.304 --> 00:41:15.005
FROM BIOMASS AND I THINK SOME

00:41:15.072 --> 00:41:16.974
OF AND I WILL CONTINUE TO TALK

00:41:17.041 --> 00:41:17.842
TO MY COLLEAGUES AND

00:41:17.908 --> 00:41:18.943
ENVIRONMENTAL MOVEMENT THE

00:41:19.009 --> 00:41:20.644
STAKEHOLDERS TO TRY TO GET TO A

01:19:50.685 --> 01:19:53.455
COST OF THIS BACK UP GENERATION

01:19:53.522 --> 01:19:56.324
WHICH AGAIN IS TOTALLY UNFAIR

01:19:56.391 --> 01:19:57.926
TO BE THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE

01:19:57.993 --> 01:20:01.363
BEING DIRECTLY IMPACTED BY-

01:20:01.429 --> 01:20:05.534
THESE PSP POWER INTERRUPTIONS-

01:20:05.600 --> 01:20:07.402
NO ONE IN L. A. COUNTY WELL I

01:20:07.469 --> 01:20:08.703
SHOULD SAY NO ONE AND ONLY

01:20:08.770 --> 01:20:10.105
CALLING BUT THE MAJORITY OF THE

01:20:10.172 --> 01:20:11.806

01:20:15.777 --> 01:20:19.381
THESE WILDFIRES SO TO ASK THEM

01:20:19.447 --> 01:20:21.116
TO BEAR THE COST OF BACKUP

01:20:21.183 --> 01:20:24.019
GENERATION IS TOTALLY UNFAIR

01:20:24.085 --> 01:20:25.620
AGAIN AS INDIVIDUAL WHO SPENT A

01:20:25.687 --> 01:20:27.222
NUMBER OF YEARS AND THE

01:20:27.289 --> 01:20:30.825
TELEPHONY SPACE. THE REAL ISSUE

01:20:30.892 --> 01:20:33.461
WHEN I HEAR LAN LINES WHICH ARE

01:20:33.528 --> 01:20:34.863
BEING INCLUDED IN THIS IT'S

01:20:34.930 --> 01:20:36.665
ALMOST LAUGHABLE BECAUSE THE

01:20:36.731 --> 01:20:38.133
REAL ISSUE WITH LANDLINES ARE

01:20:38.200 --> 01:20:40.535
VERY RARELY DO GLAM LIGHTS GO

01:20:40.602 --> 01:20:42.170
OUT BECAUSE OF A LACK OF POWER.

01:20:42.237 --> 01:20:44.206
THEY GO OUT BECAUSE OF POOR

01:20:44.272 --> 01:20:49.678
MAINTAIN MAINTENANCE AND.

01:20:49.744 --> 01:20:50.478
MAINTAINING THE COPPER WATER.

01:20:50.545 --> 01:20:51.313
JUST TEN YEARS WHEN I SERVICE

01:20:51.379 --> 01:20:53.448
HERE UTILITY. ON THE ASSEMBLY

01:20:53.515 --> 01:20:55.550
SIDE WE HAD A MASSIVE

01:20:55.617 --> 01:20:58.486
RAINSTORMS. AND L. A. COUNTY.

01:20:58.553 --> 01:21:00.255
IN DURING THEIR RATING STORM.

01:21:00.322 --> 01:21:02.390
ALMOST A HUNDRED THOUSAND

01:21:02.457 --> 01:21:04.726
CUSTOMERS. LOST ELEVEN HE HAD

01:21:04.793 --> 01:21:06.027
NOTHING TO DO OF WILDFIRES HAVE

01:21:06.094 --> 01:21:06.928
NOTHING TO DO WITH POWER

01:21:06.995 --> 01:21:08.563
SHORTAGES HE HAD TO DO WITH THE

01:21:08.630 --> 01:21:10.432
FACT THAT THAT INFRASTRUCTURE

01:21:10.498 --> 01:21:12.734
WASN'T MAINTAINED. AND THE C.

01:21:12.801 --> 01:21:14.336
LACKS THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF

01:21:14.402 --> 01:21:16.905
CALIFORNIA LIKE FRONTIER WERE.

01:21:16.972 --> 01:21:19.541
UNABLE TO PROVIDE WILL FRONTIER

01:21:19.608 --> 01:21:22.377
IS NOT A PART OF THAT. PROVIDE

01:21:22.444 --> 01:21:24.479
SERVICES TO THEIR CUSTOMER AND

01:21:24.546 --> 01:21:25.714
AGAIN IT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH

01:21:25.780 --> 01:21:27.682
POWER OUTAGES SO THE CONTINUE

01:21:27.749 --> 01:21:30.852
TO ADD LAN LINES AS TO. PART OF

01:21:30.919 --> 01:21:32.287
THIS REASON FOR BACK UP POWER

01:21:32.354 --> 01:21:34.222
IS DISINGENUOUS AN ARGUMENT IN

01:21:34.289 --> 01:21:37.826
AND OF ITSELF- SO. I WOULD

01:21:37.892 --> 01:21:39.527
ASKED AGAIN THAT WE ASK THOSE

01:21:39.594 --> 01:21:40.662
INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE DIRECTLY

POWER OUTAGE JUST THE BEAR THE

01:21:47.269 --> 01:21:50.739
COST OF THIS. THAT FOUR BILLION

01:21:50.805 --> 01:21:53.775
DOLLARS FOR. THIRD OF THAT COST

01:21:53.842 --> 01:21:56.678
PROBABLY 25% OF THAT COST WOULD

01:21:56.745 --> 01:21:58.580
BE A BETTER INVESTMENT TO

01:21:58.647 --> 01:22:00.081
IMPROVE THE COPPER WIRE.

01:22:00.148 --> 01:22:01.916
INFRASTRUCTURE WITHOUT
