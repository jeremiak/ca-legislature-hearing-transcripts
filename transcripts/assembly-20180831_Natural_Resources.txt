ALONG WITH THE ERROR SUPPORTING WITNESSES. I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS. SIGN HERE TO PRESENT ON AB. NINE EIGHT SEVEN AB NINE EIGHT SEVEN IS FIRST AND FOREMOST ABOUT JOBS AND ECONOMIC EQUITY. FOR COMMUNITIES IN AND AROUND MY DISTRICT. BUT WE ALSO WORKED VERY HARD TO DEMONSTRATE THAT IN CALIFORNIA. ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION ARE NOT MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE. IN FACT COMPARED TO PAST PROJECTS OF SIMILAR TYPE AND SCOPE WE ACTUALLY BELIEVE THIS PROJECT IS NOTHING LESS THAN THE GOLD STANDARD FOR GREEN PROJECTS. THAT IS IN PART DUE TO THE CHAIR AND HIS STAFF'S [inaudible] DILIGENT HONEST AND VERY HARD WORK TO HELP MAKE THIS BILL STRONGER. CLEANER AND GREENER SO THANK YOU. AS A RESULT THIS BILL SIMULTANEOUSLY OFFERS THE PROMISE OF THOUSANDS OF NEW LOCAL JOBS FOR MY COMMUNITIES AND THE PROMISE OF CUTTING EDGE ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS AND POLLUTION REDUCTIONS. EIGHTY NINE EIGHT SEVEN GUARANTEES THAT THE NEW PRIVATELY FUNDED. AND FINANCE CLIPPERS ARENA IN INGLEWOOD MEETS THE HIGHEST ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS INCLUDING A FULL AND COMPREHENSIVE III OUR LEAD GOLD CERTIFICATION. ANNETTE ZERO ENERGY STANDARD WHICH IS THE HIGHEST IN THE NATION 15% REDUCTION IN VEHICLE TRIPS I TRANSPORTATION MANAGEMENT PLAN AND TRANSIT DESIGN INSISTENCE. ON SITE AND LOCAL MITIGATION A THIRTY MILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT INTO EMISSION REDUCTION SOLAR ROOFING AND MEASURABLE METRICS TOWARDS EMISSION GOALS. WITH PENALTIES ATTACHED. FUNDAMENTALLY WE BELIEVE THAT SIMILAR PRIVATELY FUNDED PROJECTS IN COMMUNITIES SUCH AS SAN FRANCISCO IN RIGHT HERE IN SACRAMENTO ARE PROVIDING CLEAR AND MEASURABLE THEN IT BENEFITS FOR BOTH THE ECONOMY AND THE ENVIRONMENT. AND WE SEE NO REASON WHY INGLEWOOD AND ITS SURROUNDING COMMUNITIES SHOULDN'T HAVE THE SAME OPPORTUNITIES. I WILL ALSO MENTION THAT TODAY HAVE PASSED OUT OF THE SENATE WITH THE THIRTY FOUR ZERO VOTE. I ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT ON AB NINE EIGHT SEVEN AND WILL LET THEM. MY WITNESSES TESTIFY AS WELL.

IT A VERY EXCITING PROJECT TO HAPPEN. BUT IS ESTABLISHING. A NEW PRECEDENT FOR SHOWING HOW YOU CAN DO A PROJECT LIKE THIS AND ALSO. ACCOMPLISH ALONG WITH THAT ENVIRONMENTAL IMPROVEMENTS FOR THE COMMUNITY. UP THIS DEVELOPMENT IS IN THE DISADVANTAGE COMMUNITY IT'S IN A TRANSIT STARVE COMMUNITY AND AND MISTER PALMER IN THE CLIPPERS HAVE MADE A COMMITMENT TO MAKE THIS INVESTMENT IN THIS COMMUNITY KNOWING THAT IT'S HARDER TO MAKE THAT KIND OF INVESTMENT AND ONE OF THE REASONS WHY. IS THAT. SOMETIMES THE INFRASTRUCTURE THE TRANSIT DOESN'T EXIST TO HELP YOU DO THINGS. WHAT YOU'RE COMMITTEE STAFF? HELPED US TO DO IS TO CRAFT A BILL THAT SETS A STANDARD NOT ONLY FOR GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS NOT ONLY. FOR ENERGY EFFICIENT BUILDINGS BUT ACTUALLY A WAY TO FUNDAMENTALLY. CHANGE AND IMPROVE. POLLUTION EMISSIONS IN THE COMMUNITY AND WE'RE DOING THAT WITH TWO PRIMARY COMMITMENTS ONE IS THAT. 50% OF THE MITIGATION THAT'S REQUIRED TO MEET THE NET ZERO GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. MUST OCCUR AT THE LOCAL LEVEL WHICH WERE COMMITTED TO IN THE COMMUNITY [inaudible] SECONDLY. IN ADDITION TO THAT WE HAVE WE HAVE COMMITTED TO ALSO TAKE STEPS TO REDUCE BOTH KNOCKS AND PARTICULATE EMISSIONS BY SIGNIFICANT TARGETS AND WE ARE COMMITTED TO A THIRTY MILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT.

NOT JUST IN INGLEWOOD BUT OF THE SURROUNDING ZIP CODES AND MISTER CHAIRMAN I KNOW YOU'RE AWARE THAT. MANY OF YEARS OF CODES -- ARE ENCOMPASSED IN THAT. SO WHAT WE'VE DONE IN THE RAMS PROJECT IS WE'VE RECRUITED. HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF APPRENTICES FROM THOSE COMMUNITIES FOR WHO FOR THE FIRST TIME EVENT ACCESS -- TO THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY AND IS THAT PROJECT WINDS DOWN WE'RE GOING TO NEED SOMEPLACE TO TRANSITION THOSE APPRENTICES.

THAT WE'VE EVER PUT TOGETHER FOR A PROJECT LIKE THIS IT HAS OUGHT NOT JUST OFFSETS IT HAS LOCAL MITIGATION FOR HALF OF THAT. IT HAS NOT JUST GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION REDUCTIONS BUT ALSO LOCAL AIR QUALITY IMPROVEMENTS AND SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN ENVIRONMENTAL INFRASTRUCTURE SO WE WOULD ASK FOR YOUR ARRIVAL.

EVENING AGAIN IF MARIA WHO WAVE LEYVA MCGUIRE ATKINS PREMISE JEEP FORUM. AB NINETY SEVEN IS COMPLETELY UNNECESSARY THE CLIPPERS DO NOT NEED DESIGNER LEGISLATION. THEY CAN USE EXISTING LAW A. B. NINE HUNDRED TO SEEK TO EXPEDITE ANY SEQUEL LITIGATION. THEY HAVE THE TIME. THE CLIPPERS HAVE COMMITTED TO PLAYING STAPLES CENTER UNTIL. TWENTY TWENTY FOUR AND THERE'S NO REASON TO GRANT THEM RELIEF FROM MANY OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS AND MAYBE. NINE HUNDRED MORE IMPORTANTLY TO THE CONTRARY OF WHAT WAS STATED AND SENATE COMMITTEE HEARINGS AND WHAT THE CITY AND CLIPPERS OF TOLD THE PUBLIC. THE BILL STILL INCLUDES PRIVATE RESIDENCES. I LIKE OAKLAND WHICH WOULD REPLACE AN EXISTING STADIUM OR DEVELOP IN AN INDUSTRIAL AREA THE CLIPPERS ARENA WOULD GO INTO A RESIDENTIAL COMMUNITY. THE FORUM APPRECIATES THE THOUGHTFUL WORK OF THE SENATE ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY COMMITTEE AND JUDICIARY COMMITTEES AND FROM WHAT I HEAR YOUR COMMITTEE. AND THE CHANGES MADE TO THE INITIAL BILL TO TRY AND ALIGN IT FURTHER WITH AB. NINE HUNDRED BUT THERE REMAINS AND SO REASON FOR A BI. NINE EIGHTY SEVEN THIS COMMITTEE REJECTED A SIMILAR BILL LAST YEAR AND WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST THAT YOU DO THE SAME TODAY. THANK YOU. GOOD EVENING TURN MEMBERS DAN POEM FOR THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL -- IN OPPOSITION AS YOU'VE HEARD IN MY PREVIOUS TESTIMONY ON SIMILAR BILLS. THE COUNCIL'S CONCERNS WITH A AB NINE EIGHTY SEVEN FOCUS SOLELY. ON THE ADVERSE IMPACTS THESE EXPEDITED JUDICIAL REVIEW BILLS HAVE. ON THE COURTS AND MORE IMPORTANTLY. ON THE LITIGANTS THAT WE ARE CHARGED WITH SERVING IN A MANNER THAT IS SUPPOSED TO ENSURE. EQUAL ACCESS TO JUSTICE WE TAKE THIS CHARGE VERY SERIOUSLY. HE A CENTRAL PROBLEM WITH THIS BILL. AND ALL OF THE OTHER MEASURES THAT ARE MODELED AFTER THE EXPEDITED JUDICIAL REVIEW SCHEME THAT BEGAN IN. TWENTY ELEVEN WITH THE ENACTMENT OF AB NINE HUNDRED AND SB. TWO NINETY TWO IS ALLOWING A SPECIAL CATEGORY OF SECRET CASES. TO CUT TO THE FRONT OF THE LINE AHEAD OF ALL OTHER LITIGANTS. pUNDERMINES THE PUBLIC'S TRUST AND CONFIDENCE IN OUR COURT SYSTEM. AND CONFLICTS WITH OUR FUNDAMENTAL RESPONSIBILITY TO DISPENSE FAIR AND IMPARTIAL AND PARTIAL JUSTICE. IN EACH AND EVERY CASE AND FOR THOSE REASONS THAT THE COUNCIL IS. OPPOSED AND RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR NO VOTE ON CONCURRENT STINK. AND THAT I AYE WAS A GENEROUS IN ALLOWING THAT. OTHER WITNESSES TO TESTIFY YOU KNOW. IF YOU WANT TO SET THE TABLE ERA CAN NOW BE CUECA CAO JUST CIRCLE CALIFORNIA ALSO OPPOSED AND NOT ON THE MERITS THE PROJECT AT ALL THE JUST ON THE PROCESS OF A POTENTIALLY TRUNCATING LITIGATION AND IMPACTS COULD HAVE ON LITIGANTS NOTION ABOUT THANK YOU. ARE THANK YOU. ANY FURTHER WITNESSES AND OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL SEEING NONE -- QUESTIONS COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE STARTING WITH MR ACOSTA. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR OF I WORKED ON IT BUT YOU KNOW SIMILAR BILL LAST YEAR WITH MISTER BRADFORD WE ARE UP. SUPPORTIVE OF THAT PROCESS LAST YEAR I'M. HAD SOME ISSUES OBVIOUSLY WITH THEM A DEMAND BY TO SEE THAT THAT'S OUT OF THIS BILL. AND WE DON'T -- WE DON'T HAVE THAT ISSUE HERE -- I YOU KNOW. HAVE ALWAYS BEEN CRITICAL OF THE PROCESS OF OF ANY KIND OF EXEMPTIONS FOR SEQUINED NOT FOR BUT AFTER THESE KINDS OF PROJECTS BUT NOT FOR HOUSING HOWEVER. I'M ALSO A REALIST AND I UNDERSTAND THAT -- WE HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY THAT -- YOU KNOW ARE RELYING ON THESE KINDS OF INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS AND JOBS CREATORS AND THE YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT THE FACT THAT WE'VE GOT A PREMISES GOING TO WORK AND LEARNING. YOU KNOW NEW TRADES WE'VE GOT DISADVANTAGED YOUTH IN THESE COMMUNITIES AND AND AND I AM ONE OF FIVE BELIEVE THREE MEMBERS HERE FROM LOS ANGELES -- AND I REPRESENT THE BOTH THAT THE CITY AND THE COUNTY. I AM VERY CLOSE TO THIS AREA SPEND A LOT TIME DOWN IN THIS AREA. AND I HAVE WELL OVER THE YEARS. YOU KNOW ALL THE ALL OFTEN LAMENTED THAT THE FACT THAT IT'S BEEN KIND OF A BLACK HOLE IN A LOT OF WAYS IT'S A WONDERFUL COMMUNITY OF THIS WONDERFUL VIBRANT -- PEOPLE DOWN THE THIS IS THE KIND OF THING THAT GIVES COMMUNITIES A SHOT IN THE ARM IS THE KIND OF THING THAT BRINGS UP ENTIRE NEIGHBORHOODS AND COMMUNITIES AND DISTRICTS AND HELPS -- AND THAT'S I GOT CUT OFF BY THE CHAIR BECAUSE I WAS GOING TO LONG APPARENTLY. THANK YOU SO CHAIR I GUESS THAT MIGHT THAT'S LIKELY TO HIT WARNING BUT I ONLY HAD ONLY NEED A COUPLE MORE SECONDS YOU KNOW -- WE HAD SOME SNAFUS ON ME I'M GETTING ON TO THE BILL THIS GO AROUND AND AND AND THOSE THINGS DO HAPPEN. ARE HOWEVER DOESN'T -- IT DOESN'T DIMINISH MY ENTHUSIASM. FOR THE FACT THAT WE NEED THIS KIND OF THE PROJECT WE BUT WE ALSO NEED. ANY KIND OF RELIEF WE CAN FROM THE ONEROUS WEIGHT OF OF SEQUENT NOT THE ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW. NOT THE ENVIRONMENTAL MITIGATION THAT'S ALL HERE. BUT WE NEED TO HAVE SOME A CLARITY FOR VERY LARGE AND SMALL PROJECTS I WILL I WILL SAY. I HOPE WE CAN CONTINUE WORK WITH -- THE OPPONENTS I AND THE PROPONENTS IN THE FUTURE ON HOUSING. BECAUSE IT'S DESPERATELY NEEDED IT'S NEEDED IN THIS PARTICULAR AREA GOING FORWARD BUT AT THE SAME TIME -- I WILL TAKE A THIS PROJECT AND SUPPORT IT AND I'D LIKE TO MOVE THE BILL -- AND AND GET THE SUB PROCESS MOVING THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS AND THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AGAIN. ALRIGHT THANK YOU [inaudible] MR SHOWN. THAT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND AT AT THE RISK OF HAVE A SEAT NEXT TO MY SEAT MATE FOR THE REST THE EVENING. AND HEAR ABOUT THIS I AM SURE AGAIN TO GET GET I I AM ACTUALLY GOING TO OPPOSE IT. BECAUSE WE IS. SURE TO GRAY PROJECT WILL DO SOME GREAT THINGS THAT'S NOT MY ISSUE AT ALL. THIS BILL AND ALL THE PREVIOUS ONES AND I HAVE A VERY CONSISTENT VOTING RECORD ON THESE ARE REALLY BUILT AROUND A FLAWED PRESUMPTION. THAT SICK WAS AN ISSUE SEEK WAS A PROBLEM. AND HAVING SERVED TO THE LOCAL LEVEL AND ON ANY NUMBER OF PROJECTS FOLLOWING THIS IF THE PROCESS. IT CAN GET DONE. IT DOES GET DONE A GETS DONE ON A REGULAR BASIS BUT THESE KINDS OF PROJECTS. ARE RAISED TO A LEVEL THAT. THAT WE NOW SEEM TO BE WILLING TO SET ASIDE. GOOD POLICY IN ORDER JUST TO MOVE SOMETHING THAT THAT GETS ARGUED BECAUSE OF ITS COMPELLING NATURE. AND I I I JUST CAN'T. FOLLOW THAT LOGIC AND I'M GONNA STICK MY CONSISTENCY AND A POSTER PROJECT. OKAY MOTIONS WERE MADE BY MISTE COSTA SECOND BY MISTER FLORA -- MISTER MCCARTY THEN ISRAEL'S. THANK YOU THAT I HAVE SEN KIND OF BIG PICTURE -- COMMENTS ABOUT THIS AND THAT AND NINE HUNDRED GOING FOR IT BUT JUST I WANTED TO GIVE YOU THE OPPORTUNITY. ASSEMBLY MEMBER TO ADDRESS TO THE ISSUES THAT CAME UP FROM THE OPPOSITION. UP ONE WAS WE HEARD LAST YEAR AND I THOUGHT THAT THE THAT YOU OR YOUR TEAM. THE CITY TRIED IT YEAH TO ADDRESS THIS BUT RESIDENTIAL PROPERTIES BECAUSE I WAS THE CLAIM AND OTHERS THAT. THE FORMER SRO HOTEL. SELECT FEW MONTHS AGO AT JERICHO AT YOUR REQUEST. AND SO SO THAT YOU CAN ADDRESS THAT. AND ALSO. AND I'LL GET TO THOSE LATER YESTERDAY OVER ARCHING QUESTION BOT Y. NINE HUNDRED IS INFERIOR AND DOESN'T WORK. IF THAT CLIPPERS DO HAVE A LEASE. AT THE STAPLES CENTER. WHERE THEY CALL OKAY WITH THE LAKERS UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY FOUR INCH? AND DID THE NOTION WAS WE NEED DESKS WE NEED CERTAINTY BECAUSE NINE HUNDRED WILL THAT A COUPLE YEARS DOWN THE ROAD. AND THAT'S UNDERSTANDING SIX YEARS BEFORE LEASES UP SO. YOU CAN ADDRESS THOSE TWO ISSUES. HOW AM I WILL LET THE WITNESS HAS JUMPED IN BUT I DO WANT TO SAY THAT THAT'S THE DESIGN IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE SERENA WILL NOT IMPACT RESIDENTS -- BUT YOU CAN EXPAND. OSAMA MCCARTY GELANG REPRESENTING THE BRETT MURPHY SPOLE. THE CLEAR SIMPLE ANSWER ON THE RESIDENTS QUESTION IS THE AGREEMENT WE HAVE WITH THE CITY WHICH IS A PUBLIC DOCUMENT PROHIBITS THE DESIGN OR USE OF ANY RESIDENTIAL OR CHURCH PROPERTIES WHATSOEVER SO JUST PROHIBITED. AND IT'S A LEGAL DOCUMENT THAT WE HAVE. SECONDLY I THINK IMPORTANTLY. THE QUESTION IS ABOUT TIMING. SO FROM A TIMING STANDPOINT. THIS IS TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND WE HAVE TO BE READY TO OPEN THE DOORS FOR THE SERENA RATE BE ABLE TO DEMONSTRATE TO THE NBA THAT WE HAVE THE DOORS OPEN BY. TWENTY TWENTY FOUR WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT IT TAKES TO DO THAT. THAT SIX YEAR PERIOD. THE FIRST TWO YEARS INVOLVE DESIGN. YEAH I OUR WORK GETTING THROUGH THE FINALIZATION OF THE I. R.. THE SECOND TWO YEAR PERIOD. ALLOWS FOR BOTH THE LITIGATION PERIOD AND OTHER CHANGES OF MY NET TO BE MADE TO THE ARE BASED ON THE MEDICATION. THAT LEAVES YOU TWO YEARS TO BUILD. TWO YEARS IS. JUST ON THE RAGGED EDGE HERE IN SACRAMENTO THEY HAD JUST OVER TWO YEARS TO BUILD IT AND LIKELY THEY MADE IT. IN OCTOBER BEFORE THE FIRST GAME WAS REQUIRED TO BE DONE. THAT'S THE TIMELINE WE FACE IF WE CAN'T DEMONSTRATE THAT WE CAN MEET THAT TIMELINE AND IT REALLY IS THAT SIMPLE TWO YEAR PERIOD THEN. MISTER PALMER THE TEAM IN THE NBA WILL BE FORCED TO LOOK. ELSEWHERE. AND SO WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO DEMONSTRATE THAT AND THAT'S THE NEED THAT'S WHY THE AB. NINE SYSTEMS THAT WORK. SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE AB NINE HUNDRED AS IT CURRENTLY EXISTS. COULD VERY WELL WOULD SUNSET DURING OUR CERTIFICATION PARA. NOBODY KNOWS WHAT HAPPENS. IF THE CURRENT AB NINE HUNDRED SUNSETS IN THE MIDDLE OF OUR CERTIFICATION PROCESS. WE DON'T KNOW WHETHER THAT WORKS OR NOT NUMBER ONE NUMBER TWO AB. NINE HUNDRED REQUIRES THAT WE DEMONSTRATE. WITHIN THE FIRST YEAR OF THE OPERATION THEY WERE IN A 15% VEHICLE TRIP PRODUCTION. WE'RE IMAGE STRANDS AT STAR COMMUNITY. WE KNOW WE CAN'T MEET THAT STANDARD IN THE FIRST YEAR. WHAT THIS STILL BILL DOES IS ALLOW US SIX ADDITIONAL YEARS TO MEET THAT STANDARD? AND THE PRICE FOR THAT SIX ADDITIONAL YEARS IS ALL OF THESE ADDITIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPROVEMENTS THAT THIS BILL INCLUDES. YOU'VE HEARD IT TALKED ABOUT. THE HIGHEST STANDARD OF ANY OF THESE BILLS HAS COME ALONG AND AND IT TRULY IS SO THE ANSWER TO THE QUESTION IS. AB NINE HUNDRED DOES WORK BECAUSE THE TIMING. AND BECAUSE OF NEEDING THE EXTRA TIME TO MEET THAT STANDARD. WHILE WE'RE DOING OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL THINGS AND THE RESIDENTS ISSUE IS IS IS DRIVING THE DESIGN INCLUDES NO AND OUR AGREEMENT WITH THE CITY SPECIFICALLY PROHIBITS THE USE OF ANY RESIDENTIAL OR CHURCH LOTS PERIOD. AND IN THIS ELEMENT OF GOOD POINT -- DIDN'T. BY THE WAY IT AS IT RELATES TO THAT 15% TRIP PRODUCTION STANDARD THAT THIS REQUIRED TO BE MET BY TWENTY THIRTY IF WE DON'T THIS BILL BUILDS AND FOR THE FIRST TIME [inaudible] ACTUALLY ENFORCEMENT OF THESE PROVISIONS ON THE BACK IT INCREASES THAT STANDARD WHAT 15% STANDARD TO A 17% STANDARD. AND THEN SUBSEQUENTLY AT TWENTY SO. THERE'S THERE'S NOT ONLY. STANDARDS THAT HAVE TO BE MET BUT THERE'S ACTUALLY ENFORCEMENT. FOR THE FIRST TIME TO MAKE SURE THOSE STANDARDS ARE. THANK YOU. THAT PITCHER ON TO DO WE HAVE SOME RESPONSE ON THE RESIDENTIAL I TELL YOU WHAT IF YOU'D LIKE. YES I IT'S JUST A CLARIFICATION ON THE RESIDENTIAL THE BILL INCLUDES A LIST OF ASSESSOR PERSONAL NUMBERS OF PROPERTIES BY A SUCH A PERSON BIRCH AND TWO OF THOSE PROPERTIES ARE RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY WITH RESIDENCES IN THEM AND PEOPLE WHO HAVE. SUBMITTED A LETTER TO THE COMMITTEE. IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL SO I I'M JUST CONFUSED ON THAT POINT OF THE NO RESIDENTS IS INCLUDED IF. THE PROJECT AREA AS DEFINED IN THE BILL INCLUDES TO RESIDENTIAL. MR LIKE MISTER CHAIRMAN IF IT'S OKAY I'LL RESPOND TO THAT IT'S A REAL SIMPLE ANSWER -- IN THE SENATE AND I THINK ALSO YOUR COMMITTEE SELF NOT FELT MORE COMFORTABLE IF IN THE BILL WE WOULD ACTUALLY NAMED THE PARCEL NUMBERS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO THE STREAMLINING SO EVERYBODY UNDERSTOOD EXACTLY. THE ASSESSOR PARCEL NUMBERS THAT INCLUDE. THERE ARE IN FACT. TO RESIDENTIAL PROPERTIES THAT ARE INVOLVED IN ONE OF THOSE PERSONAL. THE CITY IS PROHIBIT US FROM USING THEM AND ARE DESIGNED DOES NOT INCLUDE THEM. WE CAN'T HOWEVER LEGISLATIVELY CARVE OUT A COUNTY ASSESSOR PARCEL NUMBER. THE LEGISLATURE'S NOT AUTHORIZED IF WE COULD WE WOULD DO THAT. BUT WE CAN'T. IF THOSE TWO RESIDENTIAL PROPERTIES ONE AS A SINGLE THING HOUSE ONE IS A TRI PLEX. IF THEY CHOOSE TO SELL WERE HAPPY FOR THAT. IF THEY DON'T SELL THAT'S FINE. TOO IT'S IT INVOLVES THE DRIVEWAY FOR THE ENTRANCE FOR ONE OF THE PARKING [inaudible] STRUCTURES AND ONE STRUCTURES ON EITHER SIDE. BUT THE CITIES OR PROHIBIT US FROM USING FROM TAKING HIM. AND THE DESIGN DOES NOT INCLUDE. AND SO THE THAT'S THE ANSWER TO THAT. WHY A ARE THOSE TWO RESIDENCES IN PARCELS THAT INCLUDE THE BILLS THAT WE CAN'T LEGISLATE SPLIT THE PARCEL BUT THE CITY'S PROHIBIT US FROM USING THEM AND GIVE THAT THE DESIGN? OR AN ATTACK [inaudible] ALRIGHT OKAY. SO I'M I'M GOING TO OPPOSE THIS I'M NOT SIX BRING US TODAY THAT LET YOU KNOW I'M DONE. I THINK I WANT TO SHARE A FEW THINGS ON I ONE THAT THE TIMING OF NINE HUNDRED I DON'T THINK MATHEMATICALLY WORKS OUT BECAUSE TEARS AND DESIGN TEARS CONSTRUCTIONS FOR YEARS. AND THIS IS GOING TO TWENTY EIGHTEEN TWENTY FOUR SIX YEARS. THEN WE CAME HERE LAST YEAR THOSE OXY SEVEN YEARS SO. SO SO FOR IT FOR THAT -- BUT I GUESS IT THAT THE BIGGER PICTURE IS THAT -- AND YOU MENTION THIS TO IS IS NINE HUNDRED MAY EXPIRE DURING THAT I THINK WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT NINE HUNDRED BECAUSE I THINK THIS IS A GREAT PROJECT FOR INGLEWOOD IN LOS ANGELES. COUNTY -- A BILLION DOLLARS IN INVESTMENT THERE WITHOUT ONE PENNY PUBLIC SUBSIDY IS SOMETHING TO BE. APPLAUDED DOWN THE STREET WE HAVE A BEAUTIFUL ARENA BUT IT'S TAXPAYERS UNIT PAYING SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN THE NEXT THIRTY YEARS. AND DEBT SERVICE SO HERE NO PUBLIC SUBSIDY -- I TOTALLY GET THE SIGNIFICANCE. AND THAT AND THAT -- THE OVERALL CENTER THERE WITH -- THE RAMS FOOTBALL STADIUM UNDER CONSTRUCTION. BY JUST THINK IF YOU LOOK BACK IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN WHY WE CREATED AB NINE HUNDRED BECAUSE THE LEGISLATURE BEFORE WE'RE HERE. WE DON'T LIKE PICKING WINNERS AND LOSERS. WE DON'T LIKE PICKING THE PERSON WITH THE BIGGEST CHECKBOOK. AND THAT'S WHAT THIS LOOKS LIKE. CRYSTAL CLEAR. AND IT'S JUST I THINK REALLY REALLY UNFORTUNATE. AND I WOULD MUCH RATHER I AND I KNOW THAT. NINE HUNDRED IS PROBLEMATIC FOR YOU FOR A FEW REASONS AND I DID HEAR YOU SAY THE LITIGATION WOULD TAKE UP YEARS. TO SO IT'S IT WOULD BE -- THE FACT THAT NINE HUNDRED MAY EXPIRE THE NINE HUNDRED DOESN'T ALLOW YOU TO DO THAT TRACK TRANSPORTATION IMPROVEMENTS IN THE FIRST YEAR. I GET THAT I WOULD MUCH RATHER TODAY OPEN UP NINE HUNDRED AND PUT THOSE NEW ELEMENTS IN NINE HUNDRED SO THEN. THE GOVERNOR THROUGH THE ENTIRE PROCESS CAN PICK THESE. LEADERSHIP PROJECTS WHICH HAVE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT -- LABOR AND ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS AND HAVE A FAIR PROCESS WE DON'T HAVE. TO DO THESE ONE OFFICE ONE AT A TIME BECAUSE IF YOU LOOK AT THE LIST. WE'VE HAD A FEW SOME PROJECTS IN PENCIL OUT OF LOS ANGELES. TURNABOUT FARMER'S FIELD AND SO FORTH SOME SOME HAVE. SOME ARENA STADIUM PROJECTS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO MATERIALIZE UNDER NINE HUNDRED SO IT'S JUST EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTING THAT WE HAVE -- TO PICK AND CHOOSE WINNERS AND LOSERS IN THIS PROJECT WHEN SMALLER PROJECTS WITHOUT THE RESOURCES DON'T HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO COME UP HERE. HIGHER ADVOCATES INCOME ADVOCATE FOR IT AND AGAIN. THAT'S WHY WE CREATED NINE HUNDRED TO MAKE A SIMPLIFIED STATEWIDE -- PROCESS FOR FOR BIG ECONOMIC DON'T PROJECTS I THINK OVER A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. TWO OUGHT TO PARTICIPATE ON AND I I GET TO THE POINT THAT YOU MAKE IS CRYSTAL CLEAR SOME OF THE PROJECTS THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE. TO PARTICIPATE. FOR NINE ARE VERY DIFFERENT ECONOMICALLY. AND DIVERSELY WISE THAN THE PROJECT THAT YOU'RE REPRESENTING HERE TODAY SO I I DO TRULY UNDERSTAND THE FAIRNESS PROJECTS -- BUT HAVING A PROJECT THAT JUST PICKS ONE OUR VILLAGES PICKS ONE PROJECT I DON'T THINK IT'S GOOD. PUBLIC POLICY AND AGAIN I PREFER US TO LOOK AT THAT. THE NINE HUNDRED ENVELOPE AND FIX THAT ITSELF THANK YOU. THANK YOU MR CHOW. OH I'M SORRY DID YOU HAVE SMOKE Y. JUST WANTED TO CLARIFY THE TWO TWO INTO ITS THIRD TWO YEARS LITIGATION CERTIFICATION AND DESIGNED SO IT DOES GO TO SIX YEARS -- AND YES IT IT CAN BE -- YOU KNOW HAVING THE BIGGEST CHECK BUT BUT IN THIS INSTANCE IT'S ALSO ABOUT HAVING THE BIGGEST WILLINGNESS TO COMMIT TO INGLEWOOD AND WE HAVEN'T REALLY SEEN THAT FROM A DEVELOPER IN A VERY LONG TIME. MY AS DID THE RAMS UTILIZE THAT AGREE WITH THE SENTIMENT. NOW ASK A QUESTION OVER QUESTIONS CHECK YET SO I KNOW THAT. THIS IS A BILLION DOLLARS BUT RIGHT NEXT DOOR THE RANCHER SPENDING TWO BILLION DOLLARS THEY ARE BEAUTIFUL FOOTBALL STADIUM NEXT USE PROJECT. DID THEY UTILIZED NINE HUNDRED OR OF A ONE OFF LIKE THIS TO GET THAT DONE. MISTER CHAIRMAN ARE CHAU LANGA KNOWS THE IS THE RAM STADIUM WAS DONE TO A LOCAL INITIATIVE. THERE'S A BALLOT BOX EXCEPTION TO THE ALRIGHT [inaudible] CHAU. MY QUESTION'S BEEN ANSWERED THE ON THE QUESTION WAS OF THE AVERAGE AMOUNT OF TIME IT TAKES TO LITIGATE THAT I THINK YASSER QUESTION TWO YEARS THAT'S THE AVERAGE. IS THAT CORRECT [inaudible] PLUS MINUS [inaudible] THANKS [inaudible] PLAYWRIGHT THERE'S RATES. THANK YOU IT'S SUCH A PLEASURE TO COME IN PM AN ALTERNATE. UNDER SUCH AN IMPORTANT -- SUCH SUCH IMPORTANT BILL. I DID WANT TO ASK OF THOSE SOME QUESTIONS REGARDING THE COMPARISON WITH A V. -- NINE HUNDRED AS NOTED IN THE AND ALICE'S. ON THE G. H. G. NEUTRALITY -- COULD YOU TELL US A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THAT THIS 50%. MORE THAT'S BEING REQUIRED O MEET THIS [inaudible] SO. MISTER CHAIRMAN ASSEMBLYMAN REYES -- WE'RE NOT ONLY REQUIRED TO MEET THE NET ZERO GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION STANDARDS. THAT IS IT AB NINE HUNDRED BUT FOR THE FIRST TIME THE BILL ACTUALLY REQUIRES THAT 50% OF THE MITIGATION REQUIRED TO MEET THAT STANDARD. OCCUR LOCALLY IN THE COMMUNITY. ITS FIRST TIME THAT STANDARDS EVER BEEN APPLIED IN ADDITION. WE'RE REQUIRED TO ADDRESS BOTH -- LOCKS EMISSIONS CAR MISSIONS AND PARTICULATE EMISSIONS. WHICH AFFECT THE ENTIRE LA REGION AND SO WERE REQUIRED TO DO BOTH OF THOSE THINGS THOSE ARE NEW STANDARDS I THINK THE COMMITTEE STAFF WOULD. SURE HAVE NEVER BEEN APPLIED TO A BILL LIKE THIS AND THEY ARE THE HIGHEST STANDARDS HAVE. AND I NOTICED ALSO THAT IT WAS SUBJECT TO A AND INVESTMENT CAP HOW IS THAT AMOUNT REACHED AND? WHY THE SEVEN REYES -- I THINK IT WAS REACHED BY LOOKING AT THE AMOUNT OF ADDITIONAL POLLUTION ON TOP OF WHATEVER THE PROJECT WOULD CREATE THE IDEA WAS. WE NEED. TO IMPROVE THE EXISTING POLLUTION IN THE AREA MINUS THE PROJECT. AND SO THERE WAS A TIME AGE GOAL TO ME. FOUR HUNDRED TONS OF KNOX EMISSIONS AND TEN TONS OF THE TWO POINT FIVE PARTICULATE EMISSIONS. AND SO THAT NUMBER WAS DERIVED FROM THE FROM THE GOAL OF WHAT IT WOULD TAKE TO ACHIEVE THOSE REDUCTION. IF I MAY. IT REVIEWING THE THE ANALYSIS -- THOSE PROVIDED TODAY AND THE THE HISTORY ON THIS. RIGHT I THINK IT'S CLEAR THAT FIRST YOU SELECTED. AND AN EXCELLENT AUTHOR. I THINK HAVING ASSEMBLY MEMBER COME LONGER -- DOVE. ALL THROUGH THIS PROVIDED -- GREATER INSIGHT FOR ME ANYWAY TO BE ABLE TO HAVE SOMEONE THAT I CAN SPEAK WITH. TO TWO ANSWER SOME OF THE QUESTIONS THAT I HAD EARLIER -- AYE I DO WANT TO NOTE AS AN ASIDE. THAT IT'S REFRESHING TO HAVE A WOMAN SIT. THE TABLE WHEN ALL OF THE PROPONENTS. WERE ALL MEN. AND I THINK THAT SOMETHING THE SOMETIMES WE NEED TO LOOK AT SO THAT TO A WE NEED TO BE AWARE. OF THAT I WOULD DO APPRECIATE THE FACT. THAT THE LOCAL JOBS ARE COMING IN IT'S GOOD TO SEE LOTS OF THE ARE REPRESENTATIVES THE DO TAKE CARE OF THOSE JOBS. EXTREMELY IMPORTANT ARE AND WHAT YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO DO FOR INGLEWOOD AND THE SURROUNDING AREAS [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] ALRIGHT [inaudible] THIS SEGMENT. DOES. THINK YOU VERY MUCH I'M BY A PLEDGES THAT I'D MISSED A LITTLE. EARLIER PART OF THIS -- BUT I HEARD THIS. WHEN I WAS HERE? MEMBERS LAST YEAR THE YEAR BEFORE -- WITH MISTER BRADFORD IN MISS BURKE -- AND JUST JUST TO GO ON THE RECORD THAT I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS AGAIN THIS YEAR I THINK YOU TIGHTENED UP THE RESTRICTIONS EVEN MORE THAN WERE IN PLACE BEFORE -- AND I THINK EVERYONE SEEMS TO AGREE THAT WHILE. IT MAY BE GOING AROUND THE PROCESS IN SOME RESPECTS THAT THE FROM ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES HAVE BEEN PRETTY THOROUGHLY ADDRESSED. AND THAT NIGHT I JUST TAKE IT A STEP SYRUP Y. NOWHERE SERVING ON NATURAL RESOURCES AND INCREDIBLY DEDICATED AND DEVOTED TO THAT BUT I ALSO REPRESENT A COMMUNITY OF STOCKTON MUCH LIKE THE BALLOT COMMITTEE OF INGLEWOOD THAT HAS. OFTEN BEEN OVERLOOKED WHEN IT COMES TO JOBS AND INVESTMENT AND BEEN COMMITTED DEVELOPMENT. AND SO WHEN YOU LOO AT THAT WHOLE KIND A PACKAGE OF WHAT THIS PROVIDES. I'M GONNA COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS AND AGAIN NEW GOING ABOVE AND BEYOND. REALLY TRY TO MITIGATE SOME ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES -- THAT THE AIR WE BREATHE IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT BUT WE ALWAYS PRE BETTER WHEN WE HAVE JOBS. MISLIM ON THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD TO AND I I THINK IT'S PROVIDED YET ANOTHER IMPORTANT CONVERSATION -- ABOUT A OUR PROCESS IN THE STATE'S ABOUT SEQUEL ABOUT WHAT IT MEANS AND IN THE FUTURE -- I WILL NOT BE SUPPORTING THE BILL AND TODAY I DIDN'T IN THE PAST I HAVE INTO -- AND I THINK I WHILE I COMPLETELY -- IF YOU KNOW INGLEWOOD'S AN AREA I'M FAMILIAR WITH I HAVE FAMILY THERE. AND THEY'RE ALL THE TIME -- AND I UNDERSTAND -- THE IMPORTANCE OF WHAT THIS MEANS I'LL SO I'D KNOW THAT SEEK WHAT I'M. PLEASE ALSO AN IMPORTANT ROLE. I'M FOR COMMUNITIES AND THINK THAT I HOPE -- AS WE SEE THESE BILLS COME FORWARD THAT WE THINK ABOUT IT ME I HEAR IT EVERY YEAR WHAT WE CAN AND YOU ARE WE EVER GONNA HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT SEQUEL. ARE WE GOING TO DO SOMETHING SO THAT WE DON'T SPEND AT LEAST I FEEL 30% OF THE TIME NATURAL RESOURCES. I'M HEARING BILLS ABOUT SEQUEL EXEMPTIONS. TO ME THAT'S THE BIGGER PROBLEM -- THAT SO MUCH TIME IS SPENT ON TRYING TO GO AROUND THE RULES INSTEAD OF MEANT FOCUSING ON WHAT THE WHAT AT THAT TEACHING MAYOR MAY NOT NEED TO HAPPEN -- BUT AGAIN AS HAS BEEN CONSISTENT WITH MY VOTING PATTERN I WON'T BE -- VOTING ON THIS -- BUT I DO APPRECIATE YOU BRINGING FOR THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH [inaudible] HIS WONDERS [inaudible] AND ALRIGHT I HAVE A FEW COMMENTS. WELL FIRST OF ALL THANK YOU MS COME LAGER FOR A YOU'RE TIRELESS [inaudible] PERSISTENT. WORK ON THIS BILL WE'VE HAD MANY CONVERSATIONS -- BOTH IN THE BUILDING AND OUTSIDE -- AND YOU HAVE. FOR CERTAINLY -- MADE A STRONG CASE THAT -- THAT ANGLE WOULD [inaudible] DESERVES. THESE JOBS IN THIS INVESTMENT AS MUCH AS ANYONE -- AND THAT -- YOU HAVE CONSISTENTLY ASKED YOU KNOW. IF IT'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR SACRAMENTO IF IT'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR OTHER COMMUNITIES WHY NOT FOUR INGLEWOOD. AND I THINK THAT'S A IF A FAIR -- ARGUMENT TO MAKE -- MY THE CONCERN HAS ALWAYS BEEN AS AS I THINK YOU'VE HEARD WITH THE SUB SEVERAL THE MEMBERS ON THE COMMITTEE [inaudible] ARM. AND WHAT ABOUT AB NINE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY NINE HUNDRED IS SUPPOSED TO BE THE STANDARD -- WHEAT WE PASSED -- THIS LAW. FOR V. ENVIRONMENTAL LEADERSHIP PROJECTS -- FOR THE LARGE PROJECTS THAT. TO WITH EXTRAORDINARY -- ENVIRONMENTAL. THE PROVISIONS -- THAT -- THAT WORSE BOTH TO PROVIDE THAT STREAMLINED PROCESS -- FOR THE SEQUEL A MINISTRY OF A JUDICIAL REVIEW -- AND SO THAT'S ALWAYS BEEN MY CONCERN I MEAN -- AS MR MCCARTY INDICATED -- WHEN DO WE STOP MAKING EXCEPTIONS? FOR THE POCKET -- FOR PROPONENTS -- THAT -- THEY HAD TO WHILE THEY CERTAINLY PROMISE -- THE THAT THE JOBS AND INVESTMENTS IN THE COMMUNITY -- I I THINK YOU KNOW THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL -- AND MSG. MAKES A VERY IMPORTANT POINT I MEAN THEY BY. ACHIEVING ARE BY REQUESTING THIS TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY DAY CERTAINTY. IF IS A CERTAINTY OF OF RESOLVING DISPUTES WITHIN THAT DEFINITIVA AREA. THAT IN ESSENCE IS GOING TO ALLOW. THIS PROJECT TO CUT IN LINE -- IN FRONT OF OTHER CIVIL AND CRIMINAL CASES THAT THERE. THAT MAY BE PENDING -- IN THE COURT THAT WOULD HAVE JURISDICTION OVER ANY SUCH APPEALS. SO -- WE WE'VE STRUGGLED AS WITH THIS -- FOR FOR FOR MONTHS -- AND AYE WE WE HAVE -- REACHED THE POINT WHERE. WE'VE AGREED THAT IF. YOU ARE ASKING. FOR SPECIAL TREATMENT THROUGH THIS BILL. THEN YOU NEED TO MAKE STRAORDINARIO PROVISIONS -- TO JUSTIFY. THE SPECIAL TREATMENT. I JUST WANNA MAKE OF ALL OF THAT THAT A CLEAR TO EMPHASIZE THE POINT THAT. WE DON'T WANT THE EXCEPTIONS TO BECOME THE ROLE AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT MS LAMONT WAS WHO WAS REFERRING -- TO WE SPEND SO MUCH TIME -- ASKING -- FOR MOVE REVIEWING REQUESTS FOR FOR A EXCEPTIONS TWO SEQUEL AND IT'S SEQUEL AS I'VE STATED. IN THE AND THIS COMMITTEE'S PREVIOUS HEARING ON ON THE SUBJECT MATTER [inaudible] IT PROVIDES. CIVIL RIGHTS FOR PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO BE INFORMED AND AND TO BE ABLE -- TO ENGAGED AND IN THE PROCESS OF OF CHALLENGING OR QUESTIONING -- IN A SIGNIFICANT. DEVELOPMENTS THAT ARE OCCURRING IN THEIR THEIR COMMUNITY -- I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT THIS IS NOT A SEQUEL EXEMPTION. BUT THAT THIS IS -- A SEQUEL STREAMLINING IN TERMS OF THE TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY DAY ADMINISTRATIVE JUDICIAL REVIEW PROCESS SO TO THAT EXTENT. YOU NO I WANNA MAKE IT ABSOLUTELY CLEAR THAT THE PEOPLE OF ENGLEWOOD WILL STILL HAVE. I SEQUEL PROCESS AVAILABLE TO THEM. AND SO WEIRD. TALKING ABOUT. SHORT CUTTING CO ARE DENYING ANY CIVIL RIGHTS TO ANYONE IN IN THE INGLEWOOD COMMUNITY -- I THINK -- THROUGH. THE NEGOTIATIONS THAT WE'VE BEEN ENGAGED TO LAST A A COUPLE WEEKS -- PROPONENTS HAVE MADE SIGNIFICANT CONCESSIONS TO ACHIEVE WHAT SOME OF DESCRIBE AS IT THE HIGHEST STANDARDS IN THE ENVIRONMENTAL MEDICATIONS AND THE IN PARTICULAR. THE I'M NOT LESSEN 50% OF THE G. A SHE EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS TO BE ACHIEVED LOCALLY. THAT IS A DIRECT BENEFIT TO THE PEOPLE OF ENGLEWOOD. AND AND TO BE A SURROUNDING COMMUNITIES -- DE. PROVISION OF LOCAL CLEAN AIR IMPOSING -- THE REQUIREMENT OF REDUCING THEN KNOCKS AND CRITERIA POLLUTANTS THE PM TWO POINT -- FIVE AMONG OTHER PROVISIONS THE THE THE VEHICLE. TRIP PRODUCTION OF PROVISIONS THAT THESE -- DO USE THAT. A NEW STANDARD THEY GO ABOVE AND BEYOND -- AB NINE HUNDRED AND AND OTHER PER AND THESE OTHER SPECIFIC PROVISIONS. AND SO FOR THAT REASON -- ALTHOUGH IT. STILL BUGS ME I IN MY GUT -- YOU KNOW I I I DO BELIEVE THAT THE THEY UNIQUE NATURE OF THIS PROJECT WILL BE. SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS A SPECIAL IN A COMMUNITY LIKE IN THE WOULD -- COMBINED WITH THE SIGNIFICANT COMMITMENTS THAT YOU HAVE MADE -- FOR THE ENVIRONMENT ON MEDICATION -- IS THE REASON WHY I WILL BE SUPPORTING ON YOUR BILL -- MISS COME LIKE WHICH LIKE CLOSE.
