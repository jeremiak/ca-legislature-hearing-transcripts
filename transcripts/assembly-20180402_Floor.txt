ACR ONE NINE EIGHT. RECOGNIZES APRIL FOURTH TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN AS THE FIFTIETH ANNIVERSARY. OF THE ASSASSINATION OF DOCTOR MARTIN LUTHER KING JUNIOR. EVEN THOUGH WE MARK THIS AS THE ANNIVERSARY OF THE ASSASSINATION WE REALLY NEED TO RECOGNIZE. THIS AS DOCTOR MARTIN LUTHER KING JUNIOR MAKING THE ULTIMATE SACRIFICE FOR THE FIGHT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS. HE GAVE HIS LIFE. THE FACT THAT DOCTOR KING CONTINUE TO SPEAK OUT AGAINST THE GREAT INJUSTICES THAT HE SAW AND WITNESS FIRSTHAND. KNOWING THAT THERE WERE MULTIPLE THREATS TO HIS LIFE IS THE PERFECT EXAMPLE OF TRUE SACRIFICE. EVEN AS WORDS CLEARLY SHOWED HIS COMMITMENT TO FIGHTING FOR HUMAN RIGHTS REGARDLESS OF HIS SAFETY. THERE COMES A TIME WHEN ONE MUST TAKE A POSITION THAT IS NEITHER SAFE. NOR POLITIC NO POPULAR BUT HE MUST TAKE IT BECAUSE CONSCIENCE TELLS HIM. IT IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO. WORSE SAID SHOULD RESONATE IN OUR CONSCIOUSNESS AS WE COME WITNESSES TO CIVIL RIGHTS VIOLATIONS THAT WOULD HAVE STIRRED DOCTOR MARTIN LUTHER KING JUNIOR FIFTY YEARS AGO. YOUNG BLACK. ON ARE MEN BEING EXECUTED. BY POLICE OFFICERS BLACK AND BROWN CHILDREN NOT BEING ABLE TO READ AT THIRD GRADE LEVEL. NINETY EIGHT PERCENT OF OUR INCARCERATED YOUTH BEING BLACK AND BROWN BOYS AND YOUNG MEN. I AM SURE THAT THESE ATROCITIES WOULD HAVE MADE DOCTOR MARTIN LUTHER KING CONTINUE TO SPEAK OUT WITHOUT FEAR. I CONTINUE TO PEACEFUL PURSUIT OF JUSTICE KNOWING THAT HE MIGHT NOT GET TO THE PROMISED LAND. MEMBERS AS WE COMMEMORATE DR MARTIN LUTHER KING'S ASSASSINATIONLET US SEE IT FOR THE GREAT SACRIFICE THAT ANY THIRTY NINE YEAR OLD MAN. CAN MAKE WITH A WIFE AND FOUR CHILDREN. WHO?

THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS I RISE TODAY IN SUPPORT OF ACR. ONE NINETY EIGHT AND THANK THE AUTHOR THE LOS ANGELES RING THIS RESOLUTION BEFORE US TODAY. DOCTOR MARTIN KING JUNIOR WAS A REVOLUTIONARY AND HIS APPROACH TO FIGHTING. FOR JUSTICE. BUT I'M SADDENED. THAT WE CONTINUE. THE SAME BECAUSE THE DOCTOR KING CHAMPION. OVER FIFTY YEARS AFTER HIS ASSASSINATION. BLACK VOICE. AND GIRLS. DALY FACE EXTREME ADVERSITIES. WITH LIMITED ACCESS TO EDUCATION. EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES AND RESOURCES. IN ADDITION TO MASSIVE INCARCERATION AND VIOLENCE. AND IN SPITE OF THIS. WE AND REYES DOCTOR KING'S NONVIOLENT APPROACH. EVEN WHEN FACED WITH SITUATIONS AS GRAVE VIOLENCE AS THEY ARE TODAY. AND WE CONTINUE TO STRIVE FOR A WORLD. WHICH PEOPLE ARE JUDGED BY THE CONTENT OF THE CHARACTER AND NOT THE COLOR. OF THEIR SKIN. BUT AS WE SEEN IN RECENT EVENTS. OUR WORK IS FAR FROM OVER SACRAMENTO. OUR WORK IS FAR FROM OVER LOS ANGELES. OUR WORK IS FAR FROM OVER. OAKLAND COMPTON LONG BEACH. OUR WORK IS FAR FROM OVER. DOCTOR KING SAID. INJUSTICE ANYWHERE IS A THREAT TO JUTICE EVERYWHERE. SO TODAY WE HONOR THE MEMORY. A DOCTOR KING'S LEGACY IN HIS COMMITMENT TO ALWAYS REACHING TOWARDS. THE PROMISED LAND. I RESPECTFULLY ASK BUT I BOATS OUT ACR ONE NINETY EIGHT. THANK YOU MISTER GIBSON.

CAESAR CHAVEZ THIS PAST WEEK MANY CALIFORNIANS AND JOY TO MAKE AN EXTENDED WEEKEND IN HONOR OF HIS TREMENDOUS CONTRIBUTIONS TO OUR STATE. AND THE SPIRIT OF HIS WORK PARTICIPATING AND SERVICE PROJECTS IN COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE STATE. CESAR CHAVEZ'S LIFE IS OF PARTICULAR IMPORTANCE TO ME IN MY DISTRICT. BECAUSE IT WAS IN THE LANE OF THAT CAESAR ALONGSIDE A DEDICATED GROUP OF ACTIVISTS BEGAN TO BUILD THE FARM WORKER MOVEMENT. MEMBERS OF I COULD HAVE YOUR ATTENTION. MEMBERS. IS GIVE YOUR ATTENTION TO MISTER SOLACE. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER THANK YOU MEMBERS OF THE ASSEMBLY. YOU KNOW GROWING UP WE WOULD LEARN AND WE WOULD SEE CESAR CHAVEZ AND HIS TEACHINGS OF HARD WORK. SELF SACRIFICE AND PERSEVERANCE I REMEMBER AS A KID. ME AND MY SISTER HEARING THE STORIES FROM OUR LOVED ONES ABOUT CAESAR IN THE UFW. AND SEEING THE MARCH IS HAPPENING IN FRONT OF OUR HOMES AND IN OUR LOCAL PARKS. AT THE TIME THERE WERE MANY DEBATES ABOUT WHAT THE MOVEMENT WAS TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH AND WHO WAS HELPING INTO IT WASN'T. WE SAW AND HEARD ABOUT THE ORGANIZING A FARM WORKERS IN THE FIELDS. WE LEARNED ABOUT THE PARTNERSHIPS WITH THE MONONGAH UNION A FILIPINO AMERICAN WORKERS NOW CESAR CHAVEZ AND LARIAT LONG. FOUGHT HARD FOR BETTER WORKING CONDITIONS AND BETTER PAY. WE LEARNED ABOUT THE UNPRECEDENTED THREE HUNDRED AND FORTY MILE MARCH. FROM DELANO TO THE CAPITAL AND THE EVENTUAL PAT EVENTUALLY. THE PASSING OF THE CALIFORNIA LABOR RELATIONS ACT OF NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE. BUT MEMBERS I WANNA FOCUS ON A DIFFERENT PART OF. AS CAESAR CHAVEZ'S LIFE THAT. THOSE THAT KNEW HIM AND GREW UP WITH HIM IN HIS TEACHINGS REMEMBER ABOUT HIM THAT DON'T ALWAYS GET HIGHLIGHTED. ONE SUCH ASPECT WAS THE TEACHINGS OF NONVIOLENCE PERSEVERANCE HARD WORK. AND JUST SEEING THE STRENGTH AND OTHERS. MEMBERS LEDGE ONCE YOU'RE A COUPLE PERSONAL STORIES IF I MAY STORIES THAT I'VE LEARNED OVER THE YEARS. TALKING WITH HIS SON PAUL CHAVEZ WITH HIS GRANDSON WITH IS. WITH THAT. THE CHรกVEZ FAMILY IN THE EXTENDED FAMILY OVER THE YEARS AND ONE OF THE STORIES THAT ALWAYS GETS HIGHLIGHTED TO BE. IN THOSE PERSONAL INTERACTIONS IS CESAR CHAVEZ'S ABILITY TO SEE STRENGTHENED OTHERS. AND WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT WHAT DOES THAT ACTUALLY MEAN I REMEMBER TALKING TO HIS SON AND THE SON WAS TALKING ABOUT. YOU KNOW MY FATHER SON ME STRENGTH THAT I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW THAT I POSSESS. HE PUT HIM IN CHARGE OF POSITIONS AND IN CHARGE OF JOBS. STARTING FROM A PRINTING PRESS. AND DOING SOMETHING SO SMALL AND SO MINUTE. BUT HE THOUGHT IT WAS JUST A BUT HOW THAT TRAIN HIM TO BE A BETTER ORGANIZER IN A BETTER LEADER AND UNDERSTAND THE ENTIRE ORGANIZATION. I YOU HEAR THE STORIES ABOUT NONVIOLENCE SOMETHING THAT WE'RE HEARING A LOT ABOUT. TODAY IN TODAY'S POLITICAL CLIMATE CLIMATE. BUT THE FIGHT THAT WERE OCCURRING DECADES AGO ABOUT NONVIOLENCE. THE FIGHTS OF THE ONLY WAY THEY WILL LISTEN TO US IS IF WE RESPOND WITH VIOLENCE BECAUSE NOBODY IS LISTENING OTHERWISE. AND CESAR USED TO TEACH HIS KIDS HIS FAMILY AND EVERYBODY IN THE MOVEMENT. THAT YOU GET MORE ACCOMPLISHED WITH NON VIOLENCE BECAUSE THAT PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO. YOU GET MORE DONE WITH NON VIOLENCE BECAUSE YOU DO NOT LET HATE. CONTROL YOU. YOUR ACTIONS AND THE SITUATION AROUND YOU. THOSE ARE LESSONS A BELIEVER VERY PERTINENT FOR TODAY'S POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT. THE OTHER. THE OTHER THING THAT YOU WON'T HEAR ABOUT OR READ ABOUT PROBABLY TOO MUCH IN THE PAPERS. BUT JUST GROWING UP IN THE AREA. IS THE DEDICATION TO HARD WORK AND PERSEVERANCE. AND THE PERSEVERANCE IS ONE OF THINGS I WANT HIGHLY BECAUSE WE ALWAYS READ ABOUT THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF CESAR CHAVEZ. AND OF THE UNION BUT WE NEVER HEAR ABOUT. THE LOSSES IN THE HARD TIMES. AND WHEN YOU TALK TO HIS FAMILY YEAR TALK UP TO TALK TO PEOPLE THAT GREW UP IN THE AREA. THEY'LL TELL YOU ABOUT A LOT OF TIMES. WHEN THEY CAME UP ON THE SHORT END OF THE STICK. AND CESAR USED TO TELL HIS KIDS. USED TO TELL THEM. IF YOU FOUGHT AS HARD AS YOU COULD FIGHT AND YOU DID EVERYTHING THAT YOU COULD POSSIBLY DO. THE NEW DIDN'T LOSE. THE ONLY TIME YOU LOSE IS WHEN YOU GIVE UP HOPE. WHEN YOU NO LONGER GET UP DUST YOURSELF OFF. WHICH IS YOU TO FIGHT FOR ANOTHER DAY. IN NINETEEN NINETY THREE. CESAR CHAVEZ PASSED AWAY. AND OVER FORTY THOUSAND PEOPLE MARCHED MINUS CASKET. IN THE LANE L. OF FORTY ACRES. AND CLOSE MEMBERS I JUST WANT TO CLOSE WITH A COUPLE OF THINGS. ONE. HIS WORDS I THINK HOLD TRUE TO BE A. AND TO MANY OF US HERE. THAT ONE SOCIAL CHANGE BEGINS THEY CANNOT BE REVERSED. YOU CANNOT AND EDUCATE THE PERSON WHO HAS LEARNED TO READ. YOU CAN THAT. YOU CANNOT HUMILIATE THE PERSON WHO FILLS PRIDE. YOU CANNOT OPPRESS THE PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT AFRAID ANYMORE. SPEAKER MEMBERS I ASK. THAT THE ROLL BE OPEN FOR COAUTHORS FOR AN AMERICAN HERO. AN AMERICAN WHO SERVED HIS COUNTRY BULLY HIS COUNTRY HONORABLY IN THE U. S. NAVY. AND WHO HAS BEEN AWARDED THE MEDAL OF HONOR. AND WAS ACTUALLY INDUCTED INTO THE HALL OF FAME IN TWO THOUSAND SIX BY.

AND STIRRERS ONE'S REFLECTIONS UPON WHAT WE ALL ABOUT WHAT IS. WHAT IS GOING ON HERE? AND I WOULD JUST ONE OR KNOWLEDGE THAT THESE SORTS OF CONVERSATIONS WHEN THEY HAPPEN IN OUR NATION. ARE VERY AMERICAN CONVERSATIONS. THEY ARE VERY FUNDAMENTAL TO THE MEANING OF AMERICA. AND THEY'RE VERY ASPIRATIONAL ALTHOUGH WE TODAY ARE LOOKING BACK. THE REAL MEANING IS LOOKING FORWARD. AND JUST TO. PUT A SPOTLIGHT ON THAT PERMISSION TO READ. WITHOUT OBJECTION. FROM A DOCUMENT ADOPTED ON JULY FOURTH SEVENTEEN SEVENTY SIX. WE HOLD THESE TRUTHS TO BE SELF EVIDENT. MEANING INCONTESTABLE. NO ONE COULD DISPUTE THEM. THAT ALL MEN ARE CREATED EQUAL. THAT THEIR ENDOWED BY THEIR CREATOR. I SAY ON THIS DAY AFTER EASTER. THEY ARE ENDOWED BY THEIR CREATOR INVESTED. BY THEIR CREATOR ALL MEN AND WOMEN. ENDOWED BY THEIR CREATOR WITH CERTAIN UNALIENABLE RIGHTS. WHICH IS TO SAY THESE ARE RIGHTS THAT NO ONE CAN TRANSFER. THAT'S THE LAWYER IN ME. I'M ALIENABLE RIGHTS. IN DOWN BY THEIR CREATOR WITH CERTAIN INALIENABLE RIGHTS IF THEY CANNOT TRANSFER AWAY. NOR. ACCORDING THIS DOG WOULD DO WE HAVE ANY RIGHT EXPECTING PEOPLE TO SURRENDER THOSE RIGHTS. TO ACT AS IF THEY DO NOT POSSESS THOSE RIGHTS. CONDUCT THEMSELVES AS ALL THE ARE SUBJECT TO SOME DIFFERENT STANDARD THAN THEIR NEIGHBOR. ENDOWED BY THEIR CREATOR WITH CERTAIN UNALIENABLE RIGHTS THAT AMONG THESE ARE LIFE LIBERTY AND THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS. THESE. TITANS WHO WE ARE ON THE FLOOR TODAY. WERE REALLY STAND IT UP. IN DEFENSE OF PEOPLE. AND THEIR UNALIENABLE RIGHTS. THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE THE FULL EXERCISE OF THOSE RIGHTS. AND THIS WAS A PART OF WHAT IT MEANS TO BE AN AMERICAN CITIZEN. TO RESIDE IN AMERICA. TO NOT HAVE SOCIETY ACT AS IF YOU MUST SURRENDER. IN A THESE VALUED. PORTIONS OF YOUR HERITAGE. AND I KNOW TO THOMAS JEFFERSON WHO ACTUALLY PENNED THESE WORDS WENT ON TO SAY. THAT TO SECURE THESE RIGHTS GOVERNMENTS ARE INSTITUTED AMONG MEN. DERIVING THEIR JUST POWERS THINKS SO THE GOVERN. THAT WHENEVER ANY FORM OF GOVERNMENT BECOMES DESTRUCTIVE DESTRUCTIVE TO THE SYRIANS. THE DOES NOT FURTHER THESE. THE ACQUISITION IN THE EXERCISE OF THESE RIGHTS. IT IS THE RIGHT OF THE PEOPLE TO ALTER OR ABOLISH IT. WHICH IS WHY THESE CONVERSATIONS STARTED OUR SOCIETY. PEOPLE CONCERNED ABOUT WHETHER THESE RIGHTS ARE BEING. SURRENDER. OR IN SOME WAY BEEN DESTROYED OR HINDER. A. RIGHT OF THE PEOPLE TO ALTER OR ABOLISH IT IS HER NEW GOVERNMENT LAYING ITS FOUNDATION. ON SUCH PRINCIPLES AND ORGANIZING ITS POWERS IN SUCH FORM AS TO THEM SHALL SEEM MOST LIKELY TO EFFECT THEIR SAFETY AND HAPPINESS. SO WE HONOR THESE AS I SAY GREAT TITANS. OF THE AMERICAN VERSION OF. OUR DEMOCRACY. OF THESE UNALIENABLE RIGHTS WHICH WE SHOULDNOT BE. WITHHELD. CANNOT BE TRANSFERRED AND NO ONE IS ENTITLED TO THINK THAT SOMEONE WOULD SURRENDER THEIR. INDEED IT IS OUR JOB TO UPHOLD THEIR EXERCISE. AND SO WE. WE ARE GREAT AREAS OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE IN THE FACE OF A TIME WHEN. SOME WAS ACCUSTOMED THINK IT'S SOMEONE DID NOT ANSWERS. THIS QUALITY OF RIGHT TO ASSERT THAT RIGHT TO ADVOCATE FOR. AND IT IS A LESSON OF HISTORY LESSON FOR OUR NATION GOING FORWARD. AND IT'S IN STANDING UP FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE LEGITIMACY. A. REVEALS ITSELF. AND A LOT A RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE. THANK YOU MISS COOLEY. MR MEDINA YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND COLLEAGUES. FIFTY TWO YEARS AGO TO THE DAY.
