WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED IS THAT

00:13:08.387 --> 00:13:10.723
THE FIRST CASES OCCURRED. IN

00:13:10.789 --> 00:13:12.291

WE'VE SEEN IT WITH BACTERIAL

00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:36.715
INFECTIONS LIKE LYME DISEASE- WE

00:13:36.782 --> 00:13:38.050
NEVER QUITE FULLY UNDERSTOOD

00:13:38.117 --> 00:13:39.351
WHAT HAPPENED THE PAST BUT WE

00:13:39.418 --> 00:13:41.320
HAD A VAGUE SENSE BACK IN THE

00:13:41.387 --> 00:13:42.354
DAY THAT SOMETHING MIGHT HAPPEN

00:13:42.421 --> 00:13:45.558
SO WE- PUT TOGETHER COHORT WORRY

00:13:45.624 --> 00:13:47.193
BEGAN TO ENROLL PEOPLE. WHO

00:13:47.259 --> 00:13:48.894
BASICALLY SURVIVING JUDE SETTING

00:13:48.961 --> 00:13:50.296
AND JUST STARTEDTO FOLLOW THEM

00:13:50.362 --> 00:13:51.397
FORWARD IN TIME AND THERE WERE

00:13:51.463 --> 00:13:54.366
TWO YEARS INTO THIS AND I'M I'M

00:13:54.433 --> 00:13:55.100
ACTUALLY A BIT ABOUT WHAT WE

00:13:55.167 --> 00:13:56.402
LEARNT. BUT WHAT HAPPENED NEXT

00:13:56.468 --> 00:13:58.437
AFTER THIS WAS IN IN ON THE

00:13:58.504 --> 00:14:00.072
FIRST FEW MONTHS ON SOCIAL

00:14:00.139 --> 00:14:01.173
MEDIA. THESE REPORTS JUST

00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:03.375
EXPLODED AND THEN THESE ADVOCACY

00:14:03.442 --> 00:14:06.345
GROUPS. BUT A FEW OF HIM YOU'RE

00:14:06.412 --> 00:14:08.013
GONNA HEAR FROM TODAY FORMS.

00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:10.216
EVEN THE SPRING AND THE SUMMER

00:14:10.282 --> 00:14:11.417
TWENTY TWENTY IN THESE GROUPS

00:14:11.483 --> 00:14:12.484
HAVE BEEN EXTREMELY EFFECTIVE.

00:14:12.551 --> 00:14:13.552
IN GETTING THE WORD OUT THROUGH

00:14:13.619 --> 00:14:15.621
THE NATIONAL MEDIA AND ALSO

00:14:15.688 --> 00:14:17.056
THROUGH VARIOUS DIFFERENT

00:14:17.122 --> 00:14:17.823
STAKEHOLDERS PARTICULARLY

00:14:17.890 --> 00:14:20.059
GOVERNMENTS- THE UK GOVERNMENT

00:14:20.125 --> 00:14:22.728
HAS INVESTED MASSIVELY IN NOW.

00:14:22.795 --> 00:14:25.531
AS OF ABOUT A YEAR AGO THE U. S.

00:14:25.598 --> 00:14:26.865
GOVERNMENT IS NOW INVESTING

00:14:26.932 --> 00:14:29.702
ABOUT A BILLION DOLLARS. INTO

00:14:29.768 --> 00:14:31.136
THE STUDY OF THIS PROBLEM LONG

00:14:31.203 --> 00:14:33.572
COAT IT. AND ITS MANAGEMENT- AND

00:14:33.639 --> 00:14:35.874
THAT'S RECOVERY MISSION OF WHICH

00:14:35.941 --> 00:14:37.443
I CAN GO INTO SOME DETAIL. SO

00:14:37.509 --> 00:14:39.445
THAT'S HOW WE GOT HERE. SO WHAT

00:14:39.511 --> 00:14:40.779
WE KNOW WE DON'T REALLY KNOW

00:14:40.846 --> 00:14:43.148
THAT MUCH. WE KNOW. WE KNOW THAT

00:14:43.215 --> 00:14:45.017
THIS IS REAL OKAY IN THE FIRST

00:14:45.084 --> 00:14:47.219
YEAR SO THERE WAS A LOT OF

00:14:47.286 --> 00:14:48.320
PUSHBACK FROM MEDICARE. WHETHER

00:14:48.387 --> 00:14:50.089
THIS WAS ACTUALLY REAL THAT NOT

00:14:50.155 --> 00:14:51.690
PEOPLE SAYING. YOU KNOW THERE'S

00:14:51.757 --> 00:14:54.093
A LOT OF ANXIETY A LOT OF STRESS

00:14:54.159 --> 00:14:56.262
A LOT OF ISSUES GOING ON IN THE

00:14:56.328 --> 00:14:57.763
BACKGROUND. DUE TO THE PANDEMIC

00:14:57.830 --> 00:14:58.831
AND THEN EVERYBODY'S HEALTH IS

00:14:58.897 --> 00:15:00.466
BEING AFFECTED- AND THAT WHAT

00:15:00.532 --> 00:15:02.134
PEOPLE ARE COMPLAINING ABOUT WAS

00:15:02.201 --> 00:15:04.136
NOT DUE TO THE VIRUS. BUT DUE TO

00:15:04.203 --> 00:15:05.437
THE PANDEMIC I DON'T THINK

00:15:05.504 --> 00:15:07.106
ANYONE BELIEVES THAT ANYMORE.

00:15:07.172 --> 00:15:08.307
PEOPLE NOW HAVE THEIR OWN

00:15:08.374 --> 00:15:10.009
PERSONAL EXPERIENCES FOR THE

00:15:10.075 --> 00:15:13.245
MEDICAL DATA ARE NOW BECOMING

00:15:13.312 --> 00:15:15.147
VERY STRONG. EIGHT SUBSET OF

00:15:15.214 --> 00:15:17.116
PEOPLE. AND THE NUMBER AND THE

00:15:17.182 --> 00:15:20.085
FREQUENCY IS ALL OVER THE MAP. I

00:15:20.152 --> 00:15:21.920
THINK IT'S PROBABLY IN THE

00:15:21.987 --> 00:15:23.389
10220% RANGE DEPENDING ON THE

00:15:23.455 --> 00:15:25.891
FINAL BUT ANYWAY A SUBSET. OF

00:15:25.958 --> 00:15:28.193
ADULTS. WHO ACQUIRE THIS

00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:30.963
INFECTION. WILL MEET A STANDARD

00:15:31.030 --> 00:15:32.931
DEFINITION NOW LONG CODE WHAT IS

00:15:32.998 --> 00:15:34.900
THAT DEFINITION OF THE WHL

00:15:34.967 --> 00:15:37.369
BASICALLY SAYS. THAT THESE

00:15:37.436 --> 00:15:39.038
SYMPTOMS HAVE TO PROCESS THREE

00:15:39.104 --> 00:15:40.239
BALD WITHIN THE FIRST THREE

00:15:40.306 --> 00:15:41.874
MONTHS. LAST FOR A COUPLE

00:15:41.940 --> 00:15:44.209
MONTHS. HAVE NO OTHER

00:15:44.276 --> 00:15:47.012
EXPLANATION. NOT HAD BEEN

00:15:47.079 --> 00:15:49.181
PRESENT BEFORE THE START OF THE

00:15:49.248 --> 00:15:50.516
WEEK AND HAVING SOME IMPACT ON

00:15:50.582 --> 00:15:52.318
PEOPLE'S DAY TO DAY LIVING. AND

00:15:52.384 --> 00:15:54.119
THAT'S- THAT'S VAGUE BUT IT'S

00:15:54.186 --> 00:15:56.655
BASICALLY I THINK A FAIR

00:15:56.722 --> 00:15:58.657
ASSESSMENT OF WHERE WE ARE. N.

00:15:58.724 --> 00:15:59.725
SOURCE COULD BE TO SPREAD

00:15:59.792 --> 00:16:02.328
THROUGHOUT THE BODY- AND SO IT'S

00:16:02.394 --> 00:16:03.962
PERHAPS NOT TOO SURPRISING NOW

00:16:04.029 --> 00:16:05.764
THAT SOME WILL LINGER

00:16:05.831 --> 00:16:06.465
EFFECTIVELY DEALING WITH ARE

00:16:06.532 --> 00:16:07.533
QUITE SYSTEMIC. THERE ARE

00:16:07.599 --> 00:16:10.436
DIFFERENT. M. ALL THE PEOPLE

00:16:10.502 --> 00:16:12.137
STARTING THEIR SERBIAN REALIZES

00:16:12.204 --> 00:16:13.572
THERE'S THESE DIFFERENT.

00:16:13.639 --> 00:16:15.507
CLUSTERS THERE'S A DIFFERENT

00:16:15.574 --> 00:16:17.443
FLAVORS RIGHT PEOPLE HAVE A

00:16:17.509 --> 00:16:21.780
NEUROLOGIC. VERSION OF THIS WITH

00:16:21.847 --> 00:16:23.682
THE BRAIN FOG IN THE ROCK AT THE

00:16:23.749 --> 00:16:25.784
AND SO FORTH. OTHERS HAVE SUCH A

00:16:25.851 --> 00:16:27.986
SYNDROME THAT'S KIND OF SIMILAR

00:16:28.053 --> 00:16:29.755
TO CHRONIC FATIGUE SYNDROME.

00:16:29.822 --> 00:16:32.591
WITH DISABLING FATIGUE AND ALSO

00:16:32.658 --> 00:16:34.460
THEIR FAMILIES AND SO FORTH-

00:16:34.526 --> 00:16:36.895
THERE'S A STRONG. DISTINCT

00:16:36.962 --> 00:16:39.765
CARDIO VASCULAR. FLAVOR OF THIS

00:16:39.832 --> 00:16:42.334
IN WHICH PEOPLE HAVE. HEART RATE

00:16:42.401 --> 00:16:43.335
PROBLEMS AND BLOOD PRESSURE

00:16:43.402 --> 00:16:45.671
PROBLEMS AND DEVELOP THANK YOU

00:16:45.738 --> 00:16:47.840
CARDIFF COMPLICATIONS I SENT A

00:16:47.906 --> 00:16:50.843
TANDEM MENTIONED- AND THERE'S A

00:16:50.909 --> 00:16:53.379
C. A UNIQUE SYNDROME CALLED POTS

00:16:53.445 --> 00:16:55.447
THAT THAT'S ACTUALLY WAS.

00:16:55.514 --> 00:16:56.382
PROBABLY ONE THE EASY ONE TO

00:16:56.448 --> 00:16:59.685
DIAGNOSE AGAIN IT'S A IT'S AN

00:16:59.752 --> 00:17:00.619
ISSUE THAT HAS TO DO WITH THE

00:17:00.686 --> 00:17:02.421
HEART RATE. AND THE HONEST.

00:17:02.488 --> 00:17:03.922
THESE ARE. THESE ARE DIFFERENT

00:17:03.989 --> 00:17:05.124
FLAVORS BUT THERE'S A FAIR

00:17:05.190 --> 00:17:07.226
AMOUNT OF OVERLAP. BUT THE KEY

00:17:07.292 --> 00:17:11.096
THING ABOUT. THIS THE SENTENCES

00:17:11.163 --> 00:17:12.097
THAT THEY'RE REALLY HARD TO

00:17:12.164 --> 00:17:15.601
DIAGNOSE. I'M A FEW OF THEM AND

00:17:15.667 --> 00:17:17.035
PEOPLE COME IN THE CLINIC AND

00:17:17.102 --> 00:17:18.137
DESCRIBE WHAT'S HAPPENING BUT

00:17:18.203 --> 00:17:20.806
THERE'S NO X. RAYS IS NO BLOOD

00:17:20.873 --> 00:17:21.340
TESTS THERE'S NO WAY TO

00:17:21.407 --> 00:17:22.775
OBJECTIVELY PROVE WHAT'S GOING

00:17:22.841 --> 00:17:25.477
ON AND IT'S A BIG CHALLENGE FOR

00:17:25.544 --> 00:17:28.147
CLINICIANS AND PATIENTS. WHAT'S

00:17:28.213 --> 00:17:30.482
THE REASONS AND INCLUDING TRYING

00:17:30.549 --> 00:17:34.119
TO GET PEOPLE- ALL OF FIVE FOR A

00:17:34.186 --> 00:17:35.454
DISABILITY AND SO FORTH. SO HERE

00:17:35.521 --> 00:17:37.022
THE BIG HERE THE QUESTION RIGHT

00:17:37.089 --> 00:17:39.391
AND NO ANSWERS HOW WE GOT THE

00:17:39.458 --> 00:17:39.992
FINEST WE DON'T HAVE A

00:17:40.058 --> 00:17:42.127
DEFINITIVE WAY TO DIAGNOSE THE

00:17:42.194 --> 00:17:44.463
SYNDROME WE CAN'T DEFINE IT WE

00:17:44.530 --> 00:17:45.998
CAN'T MEASURE IT WE REALLY AN'T

00:17:46.064 --> 00:17:48.734
STUDY THIS IS A BIG DEAL. WHO'S

00:17:48.801 --> 00:17:51.103
AT RISK. ALMOST ALL THE STUDIES

00:17:51.170 --> 00:17:52.871
ARE BASICALLY SHOWING THAT THE-

00:17:52.938 --> 00:17:54.840
THE MORE SICK YOU ARE DURING

00:17:54.907 --> 00:17:57.142
THE- DURING ACUTE INFECTION. THE

00:17:57.209 --> 00:17:59.578
MORE LIKELY YOU ARE TO HAVE WON

00:17:59.645 --> 00:18:01.013
BECAUSE OF IT BUT- NEARLY PEOPLE

00:18:01.079 --> 00:18:02.815
WHO ARE MINIMALLY SYMPTOMATIC.

00:18:02.881 --> 00:18:04.483
ARE AT RISK OF DEVELOPING

00:18:04.550 --> 00:18:06.618
LOCALLY JUST A LOW RISK WOMEN

00:18:06.685 --> 00:18:08.887
SEEM TO GET MORE THAN MEN-

00:18:08.954 --> 00:18:09.955
VARIOUS DIFFERENT COMORBIDITIES

00:18:10.022 --> 00:18:12.257
INCLUDING DIABETES ARE ALSO AT

00:18:12.324 --> 00:18:15.794
HIGHER RISK. WHAT IS THE NATURAL

00:18:15.861 --> 00:18:18.664
HISTORY IT'S ALL OVER THE PLACE

00:18:18.730 --> 00:18:20.699
- MANY PEOPLE MY EXPERIENCE TEND

00:18:20.766 --> 00:18:22.501
TO SLOWLY GET BETTER OVER TIME.

00:18:22.568 --> 00:18:24.002
BUT CERTAINLY THERE'S A GROUP OF

00:18:24.069 --> 00:18:25.471
PEOPLE WHOSE SYMPTOMS PERSIST

00:18:25.537 --> 00:18:27.673
AND HAVE SOUGHT AFTER TWO YEARS

00:18:27.739 --> 00:18:30.809
OTHER PEOPLE WAXING ME. I'M NOT

00:18:30.876 --> 00:18:33.178
NOT THAT WILL CHARACTERIZE WELL

00:18:33.245 --> 00:18:36.415
VACCINES PREVENT LONG COOK IT.

00:18:36.482 --> 00:18:38.183
THAT APPEARS TO BE LIKELY TO BE

00:18:38.250 --> 00:18:40.118
TRUE ALL THE COLOR STUDIES THAT

00:18:40.185 --> 00:18:42.054
HAVE BEEN. FOR THE DAY SUGGEST

00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:44.156
ABOUT THAT PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN

00:18:44.223 --> 00:18:47.125
VACCINATED BECOME INFECTED. CAN

00:18:47.192 --> 00:18:50.128
GET LONGER BUT BUT THE RATES ARE

00:18:50.195 --> 00:18:52.164
ABOUT 50% LEVEL. ANTIVIRAL

00:18:52.231 --> 00:18:53.899
THERAPIES DURING THE ACUTE

00:18:53.966 --> 00:18:56.435
INFECTION PREVENTS LONG BECAUSE

00:18:56.502 --> 00:18:58.804
OF IT WE HAVE NO IDEA. I SUSPECT

00:18:58.871 --> 00:19:01.240
THAT THIS WILL BE TRUE BUT WE

00:19:01.306 --> 00:19:02.708
REALLY DON'T HAVE ANY DATA. THE

00:19:02.774 --> 00:19:04.810
BIG QUESTION IS- MICRON RIGHTS

00:19:04.877 --> 00:19:06.612
IS THAT THE NUMBERS OF PEOPLE

00:19:06.678 --> 00:19:08.313
BUT GOT NO MICRON IS SO MASSIVE.

00:19:08.380 --> 00:19:09.414
WE'RE ALL REALLY WORRIED ABOUT

00:19:09.481 --> 00:19:12.050
THIS- AND AT THIS POINT TIME WE

00:19:12.117 --> 00:19:14.119
JUST HAVE NO REAL DATA TO SAY

00:19:14.186 --> 00:19:15.654
WHETHER OR NOT PEOPLE WILL HAVE

00:19:15.721 --> 00:19:17.256
THE- MICRON VERSION ARE GONNA

00:19:17.322 --> 00:19:19.424
GET A LOT OF IT. THERE ARE

00:19:19.491 --> 00:19:20.359
DEFINITELY REASONABLE TO BE

00:19:20.425 --> 00:19:22.494
OPTIMISTIC THAT IS NOT GOING TO

00:19:22.561 --> 00:19:24.329
ACTUALLY BE AS STRONG AS SOCIAL

00:19:24.396 --> 00:19:25.998
BUT AGAIN WE JUST DON'T KNOW

00:19:26.064 --> 00:19:28.333
WHAT IS THE MECHANISM. THAT'S

00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:30.168
ACTUALLY OUR AREA EXPERTISE.

00:19:30.235 --> 00:19:32.070
THERE ARE FOUR OR FIVE DIFFERENT

00:19:32.137 --> 00:19:33.906
PATHWAYS TO PLAY. IT'S CERTAINLY

00:19:33.972 --> 00:19:34.840
PROBABLY GONNA BE MULTIPLE

00:19:34.907 --> 00:19:37.075
FACTORS. AND FINALLY HOW SHOULD

00:19:37.142 --> 00:19:38.844
THIS BE MATCH THERE IS A

00:19:38.911 --> 00:19:42.281
GROWING. THERAPEUTIC RESEARCH

00:19:42.347 --> 00:19:44.483
AGENDA SMALL STUDIES THAT ARE

00:19:44.550 --> 00:19:48.887
EMERGING- BUT RIGHT NOW MOST OF

00:19:48.954 --> 00:19:49.521
THE MANAGEMENT. IS

00:19:49.588 --> 00:19:51.757
REHABILITATION PHYSICAL THERAPY

00:19:51.823 --> 00:19:53.425
MENTAL HEALTH SUPPORT FINANCIAL

00:19:53.492 --> 00:19:55.227
SUPPORT AND SO FORTH. MY

00:19:55.294 --> 00:19:57.763
PERSONAL OPINION. THAT WHAT.

00:19:57.829 --> 00:19:59.665
PEOPLE WHO ARE DEALING WITH

00:19:59.731 --> 00:20:02.634
WELCOME BUT NOW NEED MOST. IS A-

00:20:02.701 --> 00:20:04.369
THERE IS A CLINIC WHERE THEY CAN

00:20:04.436 --> 00:20:07.706
GO TO. A HOLISTIC APPROACH. GET

00:20:07.773 --> 00:20:09.608
ACCESS TO INFORMATION IT ACCESS

00:20:09.675 --> 00:20:11.543
TO CLINICAL TRIALS GET ACCESS TO

00:20:11.610 --> 00:20:14.880
THERAPY- GET ACCESS TO HELP WITH

00:20:14.947 --> 00:20:15.847
THE VARIOUS DIFFERENT ECONOMIC

00:20:15.914 --> 00:20:18.283
ISSUES. YOU KNOW IN THESE

00:20:18.350 --> 00:20:19.718
CLINICS ARE POPPING UP. BUT I'M

00:20:19.785 --> 00:20:21.286
I'M HOPEFUL THAT WE'LL HAVE THE

00:20:21.353 --> 00:20:22.154
CENTERS OF EXCELLENCE THAT

00:20:22.220 --> 00:20:28.093
EMERGE OVER TIME. THAT WILL HELP. ADDRESS THIS ISSUE BECAUSE

00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:29.194
IT'S SORELY NEEDED. SO I'M GONNA

00:20:29.261 --> 00:20:31.063
STOP THERE. AND TURN IT BACK TO

00:20:31.129 --> 00:20:32.497
YOU. SENATOR OKAY THANKS VERY

00:20:32.564 --> 00:20:34.232
MUCH- DOCTOR DIXON WILL NOW MOVE

LET YOU KNOW AND THIS PROBABLY

00:22:58.443 --> 00:23:00.145
REFLECTS THE FACT THAT THESE

00:23:00.212 --> 00:23:01.413
PATIENTS ARE ALSO

00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:04.683

C. THE LONG TERM CONSEQUENCES

00:23:09.788 --> 00:23:12.157
ARE ON THE- WE CONTINUE TO

00:23:12.224 --> 00:23:13.725
FOLLOW THE THESE CHILDREN

00:23:13.792 --> 00:23:17.395
CLOSELY AND I AM I S. IT CLINIC

IST CLINIC WE STARTED GETTING

00:23:21.666 --> 00:23:23.401
MORE AND MORE CONTACTS FROM

00:23:23.468 --> 00:23:25.771
PATIENTS P. M. DIS I WANT TO

00:23:25.837 --> 00:23:27.539
KNOW SYNDROME IN CHILDREN WHICH

00:23:27.606 --> 00:23:29.241
REALLY DID NOT FIT INTO THE M.

00:23:29.307 --> 00:23:31.309
I. S. C. TRACTORS THESE CHILDREN

00:23:31.376 --> 00:23:35.013
HAD LINGERING SYMPTOMS LONG

00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:36.782
AFTER THE- INSPECTION. EVEN IF

00:23:36.848 --> 00:23:38.483
THE INITIAL INFECTION WAS WITH

00:23:38.550 --> 00:23:40.552
MY SYMPTOMS OR NO SYMPTOMS AT

00:23:40.619 --> 00:23:43.188
ALL. THIS IS AS YOU HOOKED UP TO

00:23:43.255 --> 00:23:45.223
EACH STATE THERE IS NO EFFORT TO

00:23:45.290 --> 00:23:47.259
ASTRONOMICAL BIT LONG HAUL COAL

00:23:47.325 --> 00:23:49.261
WHICH ARE SCIENTIFICALLY S.

00:23:49.327 --> 00:23:51.730
POSTER TWO BY THE- IN NINETEEN

00:23:51.797 --> 00:23:54.166
OUR CLASS. SYMPTOMS OF LONG CORD

00:23:54.232 --> 00:23:56.735
AND VERY DIVERSE AND WE LAUNCHED

00:23:56.802 --> 00:23:58.737
NEW SYMPTOMATOLOGY EVERY DAY.

00:23:58.804 --> 00:24:00.806
MORE COMMONLY SEEN SYMPTOMS IN

00:24:00.872 --> 00:24:02.307
CHILDREN IN OUR CLINICS HAVE

00:24:02.374 --> 00:24:04.910
BEEN SEVERE FATIGUE HEADACHES

00:24:04.976 --> 00:24:07.045
SHORTNESS OF BREATH. CHEST PAIN

00:24:07.112 --> 00:24:09.080
OR PALPITATIONS DIFFICULTY

00:24:09.147 --> 00:24:10.448
CONCENTRATING WHICH IS ALSO

00:24:10.515 --> 00:24:12.784
CALLED BRAIN FOG MUSCLE PAIN

00:24:12.851 --> 00:24:15.053
ENGINES AND SMELL OR TASTE MANY

00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:17.088
OF THESE CHILDREN BUT PREVIOUS

00:24:17.155 --> 00:24:18.757
TO COMPLETE BECAUSE- I'M DOING

00:24:18.824 --> 00:24:25.096
VERY. WELL IN SCHOOL. AND AFTER

00:24:25.163 --> 00:24:26.164
DEVELOPING THE SYMPTOM THERE ON

00:24:26.231 --> 00:24:27.866
TO PARTICIPATE IN SCHOOL

00:24:27.933 --> 00:24:28.900
ACTIVITIES ARE. MEDIA STUDIES

00:24:28.967 --> 00:24:30.902
HAVE SHOWN THAT THE PREVALENCE

00:24:30.969 --> 00:24:33.505
OF. LONG HAUL IT IS IN CHILDREN

00:24:33.572 --> 00:24:36.474
IS BETWEEN FIVE AND 50% HOWEVER

00:24:36.541 --> 00:24:38.310
WE STILL HAVE A LOT TO LEARN

00:24:38.376 --> 00:24:39.945
ABOUT THE LOCAL CHILDREN AND

00:24:40.011 --> 00:24:42.080
LARGER LONGITUDINAL STUDIES ARE

00:24:42.147 --> 00:24:43.582
REQUIRED TO UNDERSTAND THE TRUE

00:24:43.648 --> 00:24:46.117
PREVALENCE. AND I'M HOPING THE

00:24:46.184 --> 00:24:47.652
COLOR WILL BE ABLE TO ACHIEVE

00:24:47.719 --> 00:24:51.122
THIS AND UNDERSTANDING THE TRUE

00:24:51.189 --> 00:24:51.990
PREVALENCE OF IT. I HAD

00:24:52.057 --> 00:24:53.592
ESTABLISHED A LONG RECOVERY

00:24:53.658 --> 00:24:56.761
CAN'T CLINIC AT CHLA AND THIS IS

00:24:56.828 --> 00:24:59.231
ONE OF THE VERY FEW CLINICS IN

00:24:59.297 --> 00:25:01.032
THE COUNTRY THAT OFFERS LONG

00:25:01.099 --> 00:25:03.168
COLERIDGE. ALONE COULD CARE FOR

00:25:03.235 --> 00:25:05.837
PATIENTS WE HAVE HAD SEVERAL

00:25:05.904 --> 00:25:08.540
PATIENTS AND PARENTS PRESENT TO

00:25:08.607 --> 00:25:11.009
A CLINIC IN TWO YEARS FRUSTRATED

00:25:11.076 --> 00:25:13.078
IN THEIR SEARCH FOR MEDICAL CARE

00:25:13.144 --> 00:25:14.379
FOR THEIR CHILDREN. JENNIFER

00:25:14.446 --> 00:25:16.815
THIS PATIENCE IS COMPLEX AND

00:25:16.882 --> 00:25:18.717
CHALLENGING AND NEEDS CLOSE

00:25:18.783 --> 00:25:20.619
COORDINATOR COORDINATION BETWEEN

00:25:20.685 --> 00:25:22.654
A MULTI DISCIPLINARY TEAM WHICH

00:25:22.721 --> 00:25:24.222
OUT INSTITUTION AT OUR

00:25:24.289 --> 00:25:26.758
INSTITUTION SO FAR HAS INCLUDED

00:25:26.825 --> 00:25:28.660
INFECTIOUS DISEASES CARDIOLOGY

00:25:28.727 --> 00:25:31.229
NEUROLOGY. PULMONOLOGY AND SLEEP

00:25:31.296 --> 00:25:34.466
MEDICINE BEHAVIOR HAS RE HAB AND

00:25:34.532 --> 00:25:37.035
SOCIAL WORK THE GOAL OF THERAPY

00:25:37.102 --> 00:25:38.837
IS TO HELP PATIENTS TRANSITION

00:25:38.904 --> 00:25:41.006
BACK TO BABY ACTIVITIES AS

00:25:41.072 --> 00:25:43.041
RECOVERY PROGRESS. AND THIS IS

00:25:43.108 --> 00:25:45.944
VERY INDIVIDUAL AND CAN TAKE.

00:25:46.011 --> 00:25:51.216
WEEKS AND SOME PATIENTS. MONTHS

00:25:51.283 --> 00:25:53.418
AND ON THIS. SO EVEN THOUGH WE

00:25:53.485 --> 00:25:54.586
ARE JUST WHEN BEN B. MAYBE

00:25:54.653 --> 00:25:56.755
MOVING. THE WITH REGARDS TO LONG

00:25:56.821 --> 00:25:58.123
CORBETT I BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE

00:25:58.189 --> 00:26:00.225
ONLY SEEN THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG

00:26:00.292 --> 00:26:01.393
SYMPTOMS OF LONG CORPORATE ARE

00:26:01.459 --> 00:26:02.994
KEEPING CHILDREN OUT OF SCHOOL

00:26:03.061 --> 00:26:05.063
AND THEIR PARENTS OUT OF SCHOOL.

00:26:05.130 --> 00:26:07.098
AND POTENTIAL FOR SIGNIFICANT

00:26:07.165 --> 00:26:08.934
PUBLIC HEALTH IMPACT WE NEED TO

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:10.335
CONTINUE TO INVEST IN

00:26:10.402 --> 00:26:12.837

UNDERSTAND THE PREVALENCE OF THE

00:26:18.576 --> 00:26:20.612
DISEASE MECHANISMS OF DISEASE SO

00:26:20.679 --> 00:26:21.880
THAT WE CAN DEVISE OPTIMAL

00:26:21.947 --> 00:26:24.849

AND THAT THE DETACHED OF

00:27:58.910 --> 00:28:00.211
SPECIALS ARE READY PRETTY TAXED

00:28:00.278 --> 00:28:02.714
WITH DISEASES BEFORE- AND THEN

00:28:02.781 --> 00:28:04.082
WE CAN TALK ABOUT OTHER SPECIALS

00:28:04.149 --> 00:28:05.417
FOR ADULTS AND SO FORTH- PRIOR

00:28:05.483 --> 00:28:07.285
TO. THAT BECAUSE OF IT AND NOW

00:28:07.352 --> 00:28:09.154
WE HAVE ONE AND THAT THE ISSUE

00:28:09.220 --> 00:28:10.655
LOG OF IT BUT MADE A- PRETTY

00:28:10.722 --> 00:28:12.190
EASY ONE TO START OFF BY TALKING

00:28:12.257 --> 00:28:14.225
ABOUT WHERE WE ARE IN TERMS OF

00:28:14.292 --> 00:28:15.627
ACTUALLY. DEFINING THAT RESEARCH

00:28:15.693 --> 00:28:16.761
IS GETTING THE DEFINITIONS AND

00:28:16.828 --> 00:28:17.729
THEN- THEN MOVING TOWARD

00:28:17.796 --> 00:28:19.297
ACTUALLY GETTING PEOPLE ACCESS

00:28:19.364 --> 00:28:21.699
TO. HIGH QUALITY CARE. IN THE

00:28:21.766 --> 00:28:26.104
FACE OF. THE UNCERTAINTY RELATED

00:28:26.171 --> 00:28:27.705
TO THIS DISEASE- SO. THOSE ARE

00:28:27.772 --> 00:28:29.007
TWO VERY BIG QUESTIONS PROBABLY

00:28:29.074 --> 00:28:30.809
THE TWO MOST IMPORTANT QUESTIONS

00:28:30.875 --> 00:28:33.078
IN ACTION LINKS- SO THE FIRST

00:28:33.144 --> 00:28:34.979
QUESTION REALLY ISN'T HAVING THE

00:28:35.046 --> 00:28:39.918
FINEST- AND AGAIN WE DON'T I

00:28:39.984 --> 00:28:41.553
DON'T REALLY HAVE A GOOD ANSWER

00:28:41.619 --> 00:28:43.354
TO THAT RIGHT NOW WE ARE DOING

00:28:43.421 --> 00:28:45.190
THESE DEEP DIVES PERSPECTIVES

00:28:45.256 --> 00:28:47.192
COHORTS AND THE RECOVERY

00:28:47.258 --> 00:28:49.194
INITIATIVE FOR EXAMPLE IN THE

00:28:49.260 --> 00:28:51.129
HOPE IS THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY

00:28:51.196 --> 00:28:52.464
WITH MULTIPLE DIFFERENT IMAGING

00:28:52.530 --> 00:28:54.365
MULTIPLE DIFFERENT PROCEDURES

00:28:54.432 --> 00:28:56.134
ASKING MILLIONS OF DIFFERENT

00:28:56.201 --> 00:28:57.535
QUESTIONS WILL COME UP WITH

00:28:57.602 --> 00:28:58.803
SOMETHING THAT IS CRISP AND

00:28:58.870 --> 00:29:00.972
CLEAR THAT WILL DEFINE WHAT THIS

00:29:01.039 --> 00:29:02.407
IS I'M A LITTLE BIT SKEPTICAL

00:29:02.474 --> 00:29:04.109
THAT WILL DO THAT. I THINK AT

00:29:04.175 --> 00:29:06.044
THE END OF THE DAY WE'RE GOING

00:29:06.111 --> 00:29:07.178
TO BASICALLY HAVE TO COUNT ON

00:29:07.245 --> 00:29:10.081
QUANTIFYING HOW PEOPLE FEEL. NOW

00:29:10.148 --> 00:29:12.784
THAT'S- THAT'S THAT'S DOABLE BUT

00:29:12.851 --> 00:29:15.720
THE ISSUE THAT WE'RE GONNA

00:29:15.787 --> 00:29:16.654
CONFRONT HERE AGAIN IS THAT. OR

00:29:16.721 --> 00:29:18.223
TO USE THAT INFORMATION TO SAY

00:29:18.289 --> 00:29:18.857
SOMEONE QUALIFIED FOR

00:29:18.923 --> 00:29:21.392
DISABILITY. YOU KNOW SO SECURITY

00:29:21.459 --> 00:29:22.293
MINISTRATION ALWAYS WANT SOME

00:29:22.360 --> 00:29:24.162
HARD FACTS EXACTLY WHY ARE THEY

00:29:24.229 --> 00:29:27.165
DISABLED- TRANSACTION PART OF

00:29:27.232 --> 00:29:29.000
THE MEETING. THAT'S HAPPENING IN

00:29:29.067 --> 00:29:30.435
WASHINGTON NEXT WEEK TODAY

00:29:30.502 --> 00:29:31.870
MEETING FOR THE SUBSEQUENT

00:29:31.936 --> 00:29:33.738
ADMINISTRATIONS TRYING TO FIGURE

00:29:33.805 --> 00:29:35.507
OUT HOW THEY'RE GOING TO FIND

00:29:35.573 --> 00:29:37.642
THIS- CLINICALLY. AND ANOTHER

00:29:37.709 --> 00:29:40.845
BIG ISSUE ABOUT THE DEFINITION.

00:29:40.912 --> 00:29:42.180
IS THAT UNLESS WE HAVE A- FOR

00:29:42.247 --> 00:29:44.149
SELECT PRECISE WAY TO MEASURE

00:29:44.215 --> 00:29:47.452
LONG COULD GET. IT'S REALLY HARD

00:29:47.519 --> 00:29:48.920
TO GET INDUSTRY TO ENGAGE TO

00:29:48.987 --> 00:29:51.422
DEVELOP THERAPIES. RIGHT I'M NOT

00:29:51.489 --> 00:29:53.391
ON THE DOORS OF ALL THE DRUG ME

00:29:53.458 --> 00:29:55.827
SAYING YOU GUYS GOT TO GET HIM

00:29:55.894 --> 00:29:56.461
OFF WE NEED. THERE'S ALL THESE

00:29:56.528 --> 00:29:59.230
THINGS WE CAN BE DOING AND THEY

00:29:59.297 --> 00:30:01.499
SAY OKAY FINE. WE'RE COMMITTED.

00:30:01.566 --> 00:30:02.634
WHAT'S THE END POINT HOW WE

00:30:02.700 --> 00:30:04.302
GONNA BASICALLY PROVED TO THE

00:30:04.369 --> 00:30:06.471
FDA THAT ARE DRUG WORKS. AND

00:30:06.538 --> 00:30:09.440
THAT'S NOT EASY TO DO WHEN YOU

00:30:09.507 --> 00:30:11.442
HAVE THESE BIG TYPES OF SYMPTOMS

00:30:11.509 --> 00:30:12.477
. ANYWAY SO THAT'S WHERE WE ARE

00:30:12.544 --> 00:30:14.012
RIGHT. AND UNTIL WE HAVE A

00:30:14.078 --> 00:30:15.613
PRECISE WITH THE FINEST IT'S

00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:17.949
REALLY GOING TO HARD TO GET IT'S

00:30:18.016 --> 00:30:19.117
GONNA BE HARD TO DEVELOP THE

00:30:19.184 --> 00:30:20.485
TREATMENT. WHICH TAKES ME TO THE

00:30:20.552 --> 00:30:21.986
NEXT QUESTION WHICH IS THE ISSUE

00:30:22.053 --> 00:30:23.221
OF HAVING TO CARE FOR PEOPLE

00:30:23.288 --> 00:30:25.190
NOW. SO YOU THAT YOU MENTIONED I

00:30:25.256 --> 00:30:28.059
DID I WAS A H. I. V. DOCK BACK

00:30:28.126 --> 00:30:29.827
IN THE NINETIES. IN WHICH- WE

00:30:29.894 --> 00:30:30.962
HAD A SIMILAR SITUATION RIGHT WE

00:30:31.029 --> 00:30:32.497
HAD. YOU KNOW A MILLION PEOPLE

00:30:32.564 --> 00:30:33.865
UNITED STATES WHO ARE SUFFERING

00:30:33.932 --> 00:30:35.600
FROM HIV THEY RUN THESE PRIMARY

00:30:35.667 --> 00:30:36.901
CARE CLINICS THEY DIDN'T HAVE

00:30:36.968 --> 00:30:38.203
ACCESS TO GOOD CARE AND HAVE

00:30:38.269 --> 00:30:40.438
ACCESS TO EXPERTISE. THE

00:30:40.505 --> 00:30:42.140
INFECTION WAS A- DEFECT IN ALL

00:30:42.207 --> 00:30:43.541
PARTS OF THEIR LIFE INCLUDING

00:30:43.608 --> 00:30:45.977
YOUR ABILITY TO WORK. STIGMA

00:30:46.044 --> 00:30:48.079
MENTAL HEALTH. SUBSTANCE ABUSE

00:30:48.146 --> 00:30:49.681
ALL THESE ISSUES WERE SORT OF

00:30:49.747 --> 00:30:51.583
INTERTWINED INTO A DISEASE THAT

00:30:51.649 --> 00:30:55.520
WAS MORE MEDICAL IS ALSO. A

00:30:55.587 --> 00:30:56.421
SOCIAL ECONOMIC ISSUES. AND OUR

00:30:56.487 --> 00:30:58.723
ABILITY TO CARE FOR PEOPLE WITH

00:30:58.790 --> 00:31:01.593
HIV MANY FORMER MARGINALIZED-

00:31:01.659 --> 00:31:03.027
FROM DIFFERENT UNDER REPRESENTED

00:31:03.094 --> 00:31:06.431
COMMUNITIES. OUR ABILITY TO CARE

00:31:06.497 --> 00:31:07.398
FOR THESE INDIVIDUALS

00:31:07.465 --> 00:31:09.000
SEMANTICALLY APPROVAL WILL

00:31:09.067 --> 00:31:09.701
DEVELOP THE CENTERS OF

00:31:09.767 --> 00:31:12.904
EXCELLENCE MANY OF THEM FUNDED

00:31:12.971 --> 00:31:15.373
BY THE GOVERNMENT- INCLUDE RYAN

00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:17.242
WHITE INITIATIVE AND I DO THINK

00:31:17.308 --> 00:31:19.177
THAT IF WE HAD THE ABILITY TO DO

00:31:19.244 --> 00:31:20.278
THAT NOW PUT TOGETHER THE

00:31:20.345 --> 00:31:21.879
CENTERS OF EXCELLENCE THAT THEY

00:31:21.946 --> 00:31:23.181
CAN DEAL WITH ALL ASPECTS OF

00:31:23.248 --> 00:31:24.649
THIS ISSUE AND THAT WILL ALLOW

00:31:24.716 --> 00:31:26.351
EVERYBODY TO ATTEND INCLUDING

00:31:26.417 --> 00:31:29.087
THOSE WITHOUT INSURANCE. THAT

00:31:29.153 --> 00:31:30.655
WOULD BE A GREAT SUPPORT. THANK

00:31:30.722 --> 00:31:32.857
YOU AND GOOD LUCK ON THIS DO YOU

00:31:32.924 --> 00:31:35.393
WANT TO DRESS AS USUAL. YES I

00:31:35.460 --> 00:31:37.295
AGREE THE CHECK THE CHALLENGE

00:31:37.362 --> 00:31:39.797
REALLY LIES IN HOW WE EXPECTED

00:31:39.864 --> 00:31:46.571
TO FIND. SO IS THAT THE CDC AND

00:31:46.638 --> 00:31:48.006
THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION

00:31:48.072 --> 00:31:50.074
DEFINE IT DIFFERENTLY BUT WE DO

00:31:50.141 --> 00:31:52.610
NEED A DEFINITION TO WORK WITH

00:31:52.677 --> 00:31:54.479
THESE PATIENTS AND TO BE ABLE

00:31:54.545 --> 00:31:56.914
TO. GIVE THISDIAGNOSIS TO

00:31:56.981 --> 00:31:59.150
PATIENTS SO FAR AS A WORKING

00:31:59.217 --> 00:32:01.719
DIAGNOSIS FOR AN HOUR BUT

00:32:01.786 --> 00:32:03.221
CLEANING WE USE IT TO SAY THAT

00:32:03.288 --> 00:32:05.356
ANY CHILD WHO HAS HAD NEW

00:32:05.423 --> 00:32:08.726
RECURRING OR ONGOING SYMPTOMS

00:32:08.793 --> 00:32:10.161
FOR ME FOUR WEEKS AFTER THE

00:32:10.228 --> 00:32:12.797
FIRST INSPECTION. IF THE IF THEY

00:32:12.864 --> 00:32:15.033
WERE TO MEET THIS CRITERIA AND

00:32:15.099 --> 00:32:17.302
WE THE OTHER COULD YOU HEAR ME

00:32:17.368 --> 00:32:18.870
USE THAT IS THAT THESE SYMPTOMS

00:32:18.936 --> 00:32:20.772
SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT THE QUALITY

00:32:20.838 --> 00:32:22.840
OF LIFE AND THE SYMPTOMS WERE

00:32:22.907 --> 00:32:24.742
NOT PRESENT PRIOR TO THE CALL

00:32:24.809 --> 00:32:26.844
WITH INSTRUCTIONS. BENJAMIN THIS

00:32:26.911 --> 00:32:28.746
CRITERIA WE DON'T SEE THEM IN

00:32:28.813 --> 00:32:30.915
ALONG WITH THE CLINIC AND THE

00:32:30.982 --> 00:32:33.084
OTHER QUESTION ABOUT CENTERS OF

00:32:33.151 --> 00:32:34.752
EXCELLENCE I COULDN'T AGREE MORE

00:32:34.819 --> 00:32:36.821
SINCE WE HAVE STARTED THIS AND

00:32:36.888 --> 00:32:38.256
JUST AS YOU MENTIONED PEDIATRIC

00:32:38.323 --> 00:32:40.825
SPECIALISTS ARE OVERSTRETCHED.

00:32:40.892 --> 00:32:43.227
IT IS REALLY DIFFICULT TO HAVE A

00:32:43.294 --> 00:32:45.563
WHOLE SET OF SPECIALISTS BEING

00:32:45.630 --> 00:32:47.832
ABLE TO CONTRIBUTE TO THIS CARE

00:32:47.899 --> 00:32:49.867
WITHOUT A SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT

00:32:49.934 --> 00:32:52.804
IN THIS PROCESS SO I THINK THE

00:32:52.870 --> 00:32:53.638
BETTER INFRASTRUCTURE BETTER

00:32:53.705 --> 00:32:55.907
FUNDING INTO DEVELOPING THIS S.

00:32:55.973 --> 00:33:03.381
AT CENTERS OF EXCELLENCE WILL.

00:33:03.448 --> 00:33:04.515
BE OF GREAT BENEFIT TO THE

00:33:04.582 --> 00:33:05.650
PATIENT. THANK YOU A CENTER.

00:33:05.717 --> 00:33:07.418
THANK YOU MR- I APPRECIATE THE

00:33:07.485 --> 00:33:09.053
INFORMATION THAT IS BEING

00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:11.022
PRESENTED TODAY BUT I HAVE A

00:33:11.089 --> 00:33:12.457
QUESTION IN PARTICULAR AS IT

00:33:12.523 --> 00:33:14.158
PERTAINS TO EDUCATION I KNOW

00:33:14.225 --> 00:33:16.327
THAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THE

00:33:16.394 --> 00:33:17.862
PHYSICAL SIDE EFFECTS FOR

00:33:17.929 --> 00:33:19.464
CHILDREN AND I'M JUST WONDERING

00:33:19.530 --> 00:33:21.132
IF THERE IS PLANS TO PARTNER

00:33:21.199 --> 00:33:23.968
WITH EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS TO

00:33:24.035 --> 00:33:26.270
GATHER DATA ONE OF THE- OFTEN

00:33:26.337 --> 00:33:27.672
WHERE IT'S USED HERE IS BRAIN

00:33:27.739 --> 00:33:29.474
FOG NOT ONLY IN ADULTS BUT IN

00:33:29.540 --> 00:33:31.476
CHILDREN AS WELL. AND I'M

00:33:31.542 --> 00:33:33.444
HEARING ANECDOTAL DATA FROM-

00:33:33.511 --> 00:33:34.912
EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS SO I'M

00:33:34.979 --> 00:33:36.314
JUST WONDERING WHAT THERE'S A

00:33:36.381 --> 00:33:38.583
PLAN IN PLACE SO WE CAN ENSURE

00:33:38.649 --> 00:33:40.251
THAT WE ARE ACTUALLY IN REAL

00:33:40.318 --> 00:33:41.552
TIME GATHERING THE INFORMATION

00:33:41.619 --> 00:33:44.288
FROM TEACHERS AND INSTITUTIONS-

00:33:44.355 --> 00:33:46.290
I DON'T THINK WE CAN FIND A

00:33:46.357 --> 00:33:47.158
SOLUTION UNLESS WE HAVE THAT

00:33:47.225 --> 00:33:50.528
INFORMATION SO I WANT TO TURN IT

00:33:50.595 --> 00:33:52.530
OVER TO YOU TO SEE WHAT YOU CAN

00:33:52.597 --> 00:33:54.332
SHARE. THE COMMANDERS SOUNDS

00:33:54.399 --> 00:33:55.800
LIKE MY PHONE YOUR BILL WORK.

00:33:55.867 --> 00:33:58.703
YES I COULDN'T AGREE MORE I

00:33:58.770 --> 00:34:00.838
THINK IT'S- A REALLY IMPORTANT

00:34:00.905 --> 00:34:02.640
QUESTION. WE DON'T HAVE ANYTHING

00:34:02.707 --> 00:34:04.942
IN PLACE RIGHT NOW BUT THAT'S

00:34:05.009 --> 00:34:06.878
SOMETHING THAT SHOULD DEFINITELY

00:34:06.944 --> 00:34:08.513
BE EXPLORED. WE HAVE HAD

00:34:08.579 --> 00:34:10.982
PATIENTS AND CLINIC AND AS WE

00:34:11.048 --> 00:34:12.850
SAID BEFORE THESE CHILDREN LOOK

00:34:12.917 --> 00:34:15.319
EXTERNALLY LOOK RATHER. THERE IS

00:34:15.386 --> 00:34:17.021
NOTHING TO SAY THAT THEY SUFFER

00:34:17.088 --> 00:34:19.090
FROM THIS CHRONIC CONDITION. SO

00:34:19.157 --> 00:34:20.825
HAVING THIS PARTNERSHIP WITH

00:34:20.892 --> 00:34:22.894
EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS

00:34:22.960 --> 00:34:23.995
INCREASING AWARENESS SO THAT

00:34:24.061 --> 00:34:25.696
EDUCATORS CAN INSTITUTIONS OUT

00:34:25.763 --> 00:34:29.734
OF THERE AND CAN'T CAN MAKE THE

00:34:29.801 --> 00:34:30.935
NECESSARY. AND THIS IS. CHANGES

00:34:31.002 --> 00:34:32.603
THAT THESE CHILDREN ACQUIRE

00:34:32.670 --> 00:34:34.005
WOULD BE A GREAT HELP AND THIS

00:34:34.071 --> 00:34:35.206
IS SOMETHING THAT THAT WOULD BE

00:34:35.273 --> 00:34:37.542
VERY HAPPY TO PARTICIPATE AND-

00:34:37.608 --> 00:34:43.114
MAKE IT HAPPEN. THANK YOU. OTHER

00:34:43.181 --> 00:34:45.683
QUESTIONS- SO ACTUALLY A DOCTOR

00:34:45.750 --> 00:34:47.985
NEEDS A- AND ACTUALLY DOCUMENT

00:34:48.052 --> 00:34:50.254
ON THIS. I KNOW THAT IS WHAT I

00:34:50.321 --> 00:34:52.390
THINK QUESTIONS OUT THERE AND

00:34:52.457 --> 00:34:53.191
AGAIN IT'S RELATED TO THE FACT

00:34:53.257 --> 00:34:55.226
THAT WE DON'T WE DON'T HAVE A

00:34:55.293 --> 00:34:56.427
DEFINITION OF DEFINITION

00:34:56.494 --> 00:34:58.296
CONSISTENT- BUT YEAH I DID SAY

00:34:58.362 --> 00:34:59.297
MY OPENING REMARKS BECAUSE NO

00:34:59.363 --> 00:35:00.765
DIFFERENT DIFFERENT RESEARCHERS

00:35:00.832 --> 00:35:02.366
IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE WORLD

00:35:02.433 --> 00:35:02.800
HAVE FOUND DIFFERENT

00:35:02.867 --> 00:35:05.269
FREQUENCIES. OF LONG COVE IN I

00:35:05.336 --> 00:35:06.370
GUESS WITHOUT DEFINITION IT'S

00:35:06.437 --> 00:35:08.039
HARD TO SAY WHAT PERCENTAGE IT

00:35:08.105 --> 00:35:10.942
ACTUALLY IS BUT CAN YOU MAYBE

00:35:11.008 --> 00:35:13.377
SHED SOME LIGHT AS TO- YOU KNOW

00:35:13.444 --> 00:35:16.080
HOW BIG HOW BIG OF A PROBLEM IS

00:35:16.147 --> 00:35:17.014
THIS- AND WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT

00:35:17.081 --> 00:35:18.416
THE FACT THAT YOU'RE TALKING

00:35:18.483 --> 00:35:19.550
ABOUT PEOPLE HAVING THESE LONG

00:35:19.617 --> 00:35:20.318
TERM SYMPTOMS NEEDING THESE

00:35:20.384 --> 00:35:23.087
SORTS OF PORTS AND SO FORTH AND

00:35:23.154 --> 00:35:23.888
CERTAINLY. AS LEGISLATORS WE

00:35:23.955 --> 00:35:25.790
WANNA BE SURE WERE THAT THE

00:35:25.857 --> 00:35:28.326
STATE IS PREPARING IS IT GOING

00:35:28.392 --> 00:35:29.594
TO BE PROVIDING SERVICES IN FACT

00:35:29.660 --> 00:35:31.629
THE NEXT PANEL YOU'LL BE HEARING

00:35:31.696 --> 00:35:33.231
FROM PATIENTS AND- AND ADVOCATES

00:35:33.297 --> 00:35:35.433
ABOUT THAT WHAT WHAT FROM YOUR

00:35:35.500 --> 00:35:37.368
PERSPECTIVE WHAT ARE SOME OF THE

00:35:37.435 --> 00:35:39.837
THINGS WE AS A STATE SHOULD BE

00:35:39.904 --> 00:35:40.438
ANTICIPATING GIVEN WHAT YOU'RE

00:35:40.505 --> 00:35:41.973
SEEING AND THE FREQUENCY AND HOW

00:35:42.039 --> 00:35:44.041
OFTEN. HOW MANY PATIENTS ARE

00:35:44.108 --> 00:35:46.744
BEING AFFECTED IN TERMS OF

00:35:46.811 --> 00:35:48.779
PREPARING TO SERVE- THE THESE

00:35:48.846 --> 00:35:53.150
THAT PATIENTS IN THESE FAMILIES-

00:35:53.217 --> 00:35:54.418
YOU KNOW. HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE

00:35:54.485 --> 00:35:55.753
TALKING A- YOU KNOW WE'LL

00:35:55.820 --> 00:35:57.455
POPULATE FORTY MILLION THE STATE

00:35:57.522 --> 00:35:58.789
OBVIOUSLY THAT SOME OF IT

00:35:58.856 --> 00:36:00.791
DEPENDS ON HOW. MUCH WE IF

00:36:00.858 --> 00:36:01.692
THERE'S A FUTURE VARIANT HOW

00:36:01.759 --> 00:36:03.127
MUCH WE CONTINUE LET SPREAD WE

00:36:03.194 --> 00:36:04.862
JUST GOT OFF THE OMICRON WE'VE

00:36:04.929 --> 00:36:06.864
BEEN THROUGH SO MANY DIFFERENT

00:36:06.931 --> 00:36:09.901
WAYS- BUT- HE- SO I REALIZE IT

00:36:09.967 --> 00:36:11.602
MAY BE. A LITTLE BIT THE-

00:36:11.669 --> 00:36:12.737
RECEIVE SOME GUESS WORK INVOLVED

00:36:12.803 --> 00:36:14.038
BUT YOU'RE TRYING TO CLOSE THE

00:36:14.105 --> 00:36:16.007
THINGS WE GOT TO EXPERTS WHO CAN

00:36:16.073 --> 00:36:17.308
MAYBE AT LEAST GIVE US. AT LEAST

00:36:17.375 --> 00:36:19.143
A BALLPARK RANGE OF WHAT WE

00:36:19.210 --> 00:36:20.144
SHOULD BE THINKING ABOUT THE

00:36:20.211 --> 00:36:23.514
BURDEN OF LONG COVE IT. WILL

00:36:23.581 --> 00:36:24.782
NEED TO ADD THAT THE STATE WOULD

00:36:24.849 --> 00:36:27.518
NEED TO DRESS. OKAY I'LL- I'LL

00:36:27.585 --> 00:36:29.487
I'LL GIVE MY OPINION. OKAY YES

00:36:29.554 --> 00:36:32.089
ITS OPINIONS. NINETEEN IN BASED

00:36:32.156 --> 00:36:34.158
ON THE DATA WHICH IS ALL OVER

00:36:34.225 --> 00:36:35.159
THE PLACE. AND ALSO BASED ON

00:36:35.226 --> 00:36:36.527
WHAT WE'RE SEEING IN OUR CO

00:36:36.594 --> 00:36:39.630
WORKERS. SO I THINK. I THINK I'M

00:36:39.697 --> 00:36:41.933
- IT DEPENDS ON THE WAY RIGHT SO

00:36:41.999 --> 00:36:44.769
THE FIRST TWO OR THREE WAYS. IS

00:36:44.835 --> 00:36:46.771
WHERE I THINK THE GREATEST

00:36:46.837 --> 00:36:48.739
BURDEN OF AMENDMENTS DISABLING

00:36:48.806 --> 00:36:52.944
DISEASE. KIRK PEOPLE ARE

00:36:53.010 --> 00:36:54.845
VACCINATED THEM WE DON'T HAVE

00:36:54.912 --> 00:36:56.013
TREATMENT WE WEREN'T MASKING

00:36:56.080 --> 00:36:59.717
THEY WERE HI VIRUS EXPOSURES.

00:36:59.784 --> 00:37:00.818
SOME OF THE SICKEST PEOPLE THAT

00:37:00.885 --> 00:37:02.887
WE'RE DEALING WITH IN OUR COURTS

00:37:02.954 --> 00:37:05.022
OUR FROM THE FIRST WAVE- I MADE

00:37:05.089 --> 00:37:07.358
FROM THE SECOND WAVE. YOU KNOW

00:37:07.425 --> 00:37:10.194
ONE DELTA CAME AROUND. A LOT OF

00:37:10.261 --> 00:37:11.128
PEOPLE REQUIRING DELTA WHEN THEY

00:37:11.195 --> 00:37:14.632
WERE- VACCINATED AND DATE. I'M

00:37:14.699 --> 00:37:16.701
PRETTY SURE. THEIR RISK OF

00:37:16.767 --> 00:37:18.636
DEVELOPING LONG COVERED NO

00:37:18.703 --> 00:37:19.837
QUESTION BUT THE RATES ARE MUCH

00:37:19.904 --> 00:37:22.073
LOWER. I'M AT THE NOW AND I HAVE

00:37:22.139 --> 00:37:23.407
NO IDEA WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN

00:37:23.474 --> 00:37:25.209
ON THE GROUND AND THAT'S THE BIG

00:37:25.276 --> 00:37:27.311
UNKNOWN AGAIN MY GUESS IS THAT

00:37:27.378 --> 00:37:29.380
WE'RE NOT GOING TO SEE A LOT OF

00:37:29.447 --> 00:37:30.481
DISEASE ON THE GROUND BUT AGAIN

00:37:30.548 --> 00:37:32.183
WE DO NOT NOT. SO I WOULD I

00:37:32.250 --> 00:37:33.451
WOULD SAY IF YOU'RE FORTY

00:37:33.517 --> 00:37:35.219
MILLION PEOPLE IN THE STATE OF

00:37:35.286 --> 00:37:36.520
CALIFORNIA. AND TEN MILLION

00:37:36.587 --> 00:37:39.557
PEOPLE BECOME INFECTED- I WOULD

00:37:39.624 --> 00:37:41.626
PROBABLY SAY A COUPLE MILLION

00:37:41.692 --> 00:37:42.593
ARE DEFINITELY GOING TO HAVE

00:37:42.660 --> 00:37:43.995
PERSISTENT SYMPTOMS. BUT

00:37:44.061 --> 00:37:45.963
DISABLING DISEASE THAT PERSIST

00:37:46.030 --> 00:37:47.965
FOR MORE THAN A YEAR. THAT'S

00:37:48.032 --> 00:37:50.568
WHAT I THINK IS IT WORTH A LOT

00:37:50.635 --> 00:37:52.303
OF THE ATTENTION IS IN TERMS OF

00:37:52.370 --> 00:37:54.472
THE MEDIA AND WHAT WE'RE DOING

00:37:54.538 --> 00:37:55.706
IN THE CLINICS AND THIS BILL AND

00:37:55.773 --> 00:37:56.807
SO FORTH. THAT'S PROBABLY GONNA

00:37:56.874 --> 00:37:59.043
END UP BEING A FEW PERCENTS I'M

00:37:59.110 --> 00:38:00.678
I'M GUESSING THAT WE'RE TALKING.

00:38:00.745 --> 00:38:02.179
I GET MY MATH RIGHT YOU KNOW

00:38:02.246 --> 00:38:03.948
SEVERAL HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE.

00:38:04.015 --> 00:38:05.549
IF YOU HAD A THOUSAND PEOPLE AT

00:38:05.616 --> 00:38:07.284
LEAST IN THE STATE OF

00:38:07.351 --> 00:38:08.986
CALIFORNIA. COULD END UP. WITH

00:38:09.053 --> 00:38:13.591
PROFOUND. RESIDUAL DISEASE AS

00:38:13.658 --> 00:38:16.260
HAVING A- BIG IMPACT ON THEIR

00:38:16.327 --> 00:38:18.129
DAY TO DAY LIFE. ALL RIGHT THANK

00:38:18.195 --> 00:38:20.598
YOU. I CAN UNDERSTAND YOU I TAKE

00:38:20.665 --> 00:38:23.200
A SHOT AT THAT QUESTION. YEAH

00:38:23.267 --> 00:38:26.103
THAT WAS ADULTS I MEAN I MEAN I

00:38:26.170 --> 00:38:27.805
HAVE NOTHING I KNOW NOTHING

00:38:27.872 --> 00:38:29.040
ABOUT CHILDREN. A OUT OF IT WITH

00:38:29.106 --> 00:38:30.641
CHILDREN IT GETS A LITTLE MORE

00:38:30.708 --> 00:38:33.778
COMPLICATED THAT I'VE I MEAN THE

00:38:33.844 --> 00:38:34.645
ADULT CALENDAR WHAT LONG

00:38:34.712 --> 00:38:37.648
CORBETT- IT HAS BEEN LONGER.

00:38:37.715 --> 00:38:39.750
WITH ME WE ARE ONLY JUST

00:38:39.817 --> 00:38:41.118
STARTING TO EXPLORE THIS

00:38:41.185 --> 00:38:43.387
DIAGNOSIS AND PEDIATRICS. SO I

00:38:43.454 --> 00:38:45.556
WOULD SAY IT THE INFORMATION IS

00:38:45.623 --> 00:38:47.591
B. GET IN PEDIATRICS EVEN MORE

00:38:47.658 --> 00:38:50.027
LACKING THAN THAT AND IT DOES.

00:38:50.094 --> 00:38:52.129
BUT WHAT I CAN WHAT I CAN TELL

00:38:52.196 --> 00:38:53.698
YOU IS THAT JUST AS DR PEAKS

00:38:53.764 --> 00:38:55.633
THAT WE ARE NOW SEEING PATIENTS

00:38:55.700 --> 00:38:57.234
WERE HAVING LONG CALL WHICH AS A

00:38:57.301 --> 00:38:59.103
CONSEQUENCE OF THE FIRST RATE.

00:38:59.170 --> 00:39:01.439
OUR ONLY DATA SO THERE IS A

00:39:01.505 --> 00:39:03.107
LARGE MORE WE WILL SEE IN THE

00:39:03.174 --> 00:39:04.975
NEXT FEW MONTHS AND JUST SINCE

00:39:05.042 --> 00:39:07.645
THE THIS- CLINIC OPEN WHICH WAS

00:39:07.712 --> 00:39:09.280
PROBABLY THE LAST FOUR MONTHS WE

00:39:09.346 --> 00:39:10.948
HAVE ALREADY SEEN FORTY FIVE

00:39:11.015 --> 00:39:17.455
PATIENTS IN OUR CLINIC. WE HAVE. CALLS FROM ALL OVER THE

00:39:17.521 --> 00:39:18.322
COUNTRY. SURE AND PARENTS TO BE

00:39:18.389 --> 00:39:20.257
SEEN AND NOT. SO THERE IS REALLY

00:39:20.324 --> 00:39:22.326
A HUGE NEED. AND IN TERMS OF

00:39:22.393 --> 00:39:24.729
PERCENTAGES BECAUSE THE STUDIES

00:39:24.795 --> 00:39:26.464
HAVE LOOKED AT SYMPTOMS AT

00:39:26.530 --> 00:39:28.365
DIFFERENT TIME DURATIONS. FROM

00:39:28.432 --> 00:39:29.967
THE INITIAL INFECTION THAT'S WHY

00:39:30.034 --> 00:39:31.869
THEY'RE ALL OVER THE PLACE SO WE

00:39:31.936 --> 00:39:33.571
REALLY NEED SOME KIND OF A

00:39:33.637 --> 00:39:35.372
LONGITUDINAL STUDY TO UNDERSTAND

00:39:35.439 --> 00:39:37.208
THAT BETTER. BUT IF I WERE TO

00:39:37.274 --> 00:39:38.476
GUESS I WOULD PUT THE NUMBER

00:39:38.542 --> 00:39:40.311
SOMEWHERE BETWEEN TEN TO TWENTY

00:39:40.377 --> 00:39:42.646
PERCENT. OF THOSE WHO GET

00:39:42.713 --> 00:39:46.584
INFECTED. HAVE LOCAL IT. NO I

00:39:46.650 --> 00:39:49.053
APPRECIATE THAT- I WOULD ALSO

00:39:49.120 --> 00:39:50.488
AND MAYBE YOU CAN DO JUST TO

00:39:50.554 --> 00:39:53.157
SORT OF FOLLOW UP TO THAT DOCTOR

00:39:53.224 --> 00:39:54.458
BEHIND US- YEAH WE'VE BEEN SINCE

00:39:54.525 --> 00:39:55.760
WE'VE ACTUALLY SEEN INCREASED

00:39:55.826 --> 00:39:58.629
RATES. OF INFECTION IN CHILDREN

00:39:58.696 --> 00:40:01.432
WITH ADULT AND- THE CRIME RATE

00:40:01.499 --> 00:40:02.967
SO FOR WHATEVER REASON THAT MORE

00:40:03.033 --> 00:40:09.006
MORE IN CHILDREN NOW- AND THEN-

00:40:09.073 --> 00:40:11.008
AND THE VACCINATION RATES- FOR

00:40:11.075 --> 00:40:12.243
SCHOOL AGE CHILDREN STILL FAIRLY

00:40:12.309 --> 00:40:14.011
LOW I THINK WE'RE WE'RE LIKE.

00:40:14.078 --> 00:40:16.514
THAT 30% OF THEM 23% SO WE STILL

00:40:16.580 --> 00:40:18.215
WAYS TO GO THERE AND THEN WE

00:40:18.282 --> 00:40:19.617
CAN'T VACCINATE CHILDREN UNDER

00:40:19.683 --> 00:40:21.218
FIVE AND I DON'T NOBODY CAN

00:40:21.285 --> 00:40:22.653
TOUCH ON WHAT ABOUT THE YOUNG

00:40:22.720 --> 00:40:25.723
CHILDREN- WHETHER THAT- YOU KNOW

00:40:25.790 --> 00:40:27.291
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING THERE. AND

00:40:27.358 --> 00:40:29.126
THEN IN THE MEDIA JUST AS FOR

00:40:29.193 --> 00:40:30.895
YOUR LAST- CONCLUDING PART OF

00:40:30.961 --> 00:40:33.030
YOUR YOUR YOUR RESPONSE- NOT SO

00:40:33.097 --> 00:40:34.198
MANY PEOPLE SAID WELL BECAUSE

00:40:34.265 --> 00:40:35.299
IT'S NOT SERIOUS IT'S LIKE THE

00:40:35.366 --> 00:40:37.935
FLU AND COLD AND YOUR INFECTIOUS

00:40:38.002 --> 00:40:38.769
DISEASE SPECIALIST YOU'RE SEEING

00:40:38.836 --> 00:40:41.172
THESE PATIENTS- MAYBE YOU CAN

00:40:41.238 --> 00:40:46.010
THE BALLENGER REMARKS WITH-

00:40:46.076 --> 00:40:47.178
WHAT'S YOUR OPINION OF- PEOPLE

00:40:47.244 --> 00:40:50.414
WHO SAY THAT. YEAH SO COOL. LONG

00:40:50.481 --> 00:40:51.448
HOLDING POSITIONS THAT WE HAVE

00:40:51.515 --> 00:40:56.320
SEEN. ALMOST MORE THAN 90% HAD

00:40:56.387 --> 00:40:57.988
READY MIGHT BE SYMPTOMATIC. SO

00:40:58.055 --> 00:40:59.990
THAT'S WHY I KIND OF HESITATE TO

00:41:00.057 --> 00:41:02.026
SAY THAT MOST LIKELY ON THE

00:41:02.092 --> 00:41:03.294
GROUND WILL NOT RESULT IN A LONG

00:41:03.360 --> 00:41:05.796
LINE OF LONG BECAUSE REALLY THE

00:41:05.863 --> 00:41:07.231
BIG SUBSET OF PATIENTS THAT

00:41:07.298 --> 00:41:08.799
WE'RE SEEING IN OUR CLINIC

00:41:08.866 --> 00:41:10.734
REALLY HAD VERY MILD WINDS AND

00:41:10.801 --> 00:41:12.703
JUST AS YOU MENTIONED MANY MORE

00:41:12.770 --> 00:41:14.438
CHILDREN GOT INFECTED DURING THE

00:41:14.505 --> 00:41:16.907
ON THE GROUND. AND IT'S TO BE

00:41:16.974 --> 00:41:18.876
SEEN SO I WOULD HESITATE AND

00:41:18.943 --> 00:41:21.445
SAYING THAT WE WOULD NOT EXPECT.

00:41:21.512 --> 00:41:22.847
MORE SEVERE LOCAL WITH WITH ON

00:41:22.913 --> 00:41:24.648
THE GROUND I THINK IT'S

00:41:24.715 --> 00:41:28.018
SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE TO WAIT

00:41:28.085 --> 00:41:29.720
AND SEE. SO MY IN FACT DOES NOT

00:41:29.787 --> 00:41:31.655
MEAN THAT YOU CANNOT HAVE

00:41:31.722 --> 00:41:32.590
SECRETLY BOTH OPERATIONS WITH

00:41:32.656 --> 00:41:35.059
NYSE. AMBITIONS WITH LONG HOLD

00:41:35.125 --> 00:41:37.628
IT HAD. MOSTLY BETTING MINE IN

00:41:37.695 --> 00:41:39.163
FICTION AND IN MANY CASES WHAT

00:41:39.230 --> 00:41:40.497
UNDERWENT ALREADY HAD

00:41:40.564 --> 00:41:42.199
EXTRACTIONS IT WAS ONLY ON

00:41:42.266 --> 00:41:43.767
QUESTIONING THAT REMEMBER ALL

00:41:43.834 --> 00:41:46.070
HOLES EXCLUSION. SO MY LEG

00:41:46.136 --> 00:41:48.339
INFECTION IS NOT EQUIVALENT TO

00:41:48.405 --> 00:41:50.507
NOT HAVING PROBLEMS. DOWN THE

00:41:50.574 --> 00:41:53.477
DOWN THE LINE. AND IT SHOULD BE

00:41:53.544 --> 00:41:55.045
READY- AWARE OF THIS. THE

00:41:55.112 --> 00:41:56.747
VACCINATION THERE IS THIS

00:41:56.814 --> 00:41:59.383
DISCUSSION THAT VACCINATION- MAY

00:41:59.450 --> 00:42:02.019
NOT BE THAT USEFUL IN CHILDREN

00:42:02.086 --> 00:42:04.255
SINCE THE ILLNESSES MIGHT. BUT I

CONCERNED. TO KIND OF GET A

00:48:11.822 --> 00:48:13.156
BASELINE FOR WHAT WAS HAPPENING

00:48:13.223 --> 00:48:14.758
COGNITIVELY FOR HER SO WE PAID

00:48:14.825 --> 00:48:16.426
FOR AND ARE LOGICAL EDUCATIONAL

00:48:16.493 --> 00:48:18.929
ASSESSMENT AND I WOULD BE FINE

00:48:18.996 --> 00:48:20.530
WITH THAT LEARNED HAD BEEN

00:48:20.597 --> 00:48:22.165
IDENTIFIED AS GIFTED WHEN SHE

00:48:22.232 --> 00:48:23.200
WAS YOUNG. SO WE KNEW THAT OUR

00:48:23.267 --> 00:48:25.669
I. Q. WAS SHOWING LIKE IN THE

00:48:25.736 --> 00:48:26.937
NINETY EIGHTH PERCENTILE AND THE

00:48:27.004 --> 00:48:28.905
DOG WHICH OFFER MASS TRANSIT

00:48:28.972 --> 00:48:30.607
CHILD WHAT WE DIDN'T HAVE A

00:48:30.674 --> 00:48:31.575
BASELINE FOR WHAT'S HER

00:48:31.642 --> 00:48:35.178
EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONING BUT HER

00:48:39.082 --> 00:48:40.284
18% POP- AND I PROMISE YOU THAT

IS NOT HOW SHE WAS EVER GROWING

00:48:42.486 --> 00:48:45.289
UP POOR IN WAR- AND SO I THINK

00:48:45.355 --> 00:48:47.324
THAT WAS A BIG BECAUSE OF THE

00:48:47.391 --> 00:48:48.425
ANXIETY SHE HAD THAT. HI

00:48:48.492 --> 00:48:50.160
VISIBILITY VERSUS WHAT SHOULD BE

00:48:50.227 --> 00:48:51.194
ABLE TO DEAL WITH COMPLETELY

00:48:51.261 --> 00:48:52.729
DIFFERENT SO SHE HAS TO LEARN

00:48:52.796 --> 00:48:55.065
HOW TO. RE LEARN HOW TO LEARN-

00:48:55.132 --> 00:48:56.633
WHICH IS NOT EASY AT TWENTY THE

00:48:56.700 --> 00:48:58.568
GOOD NEWS IS HER BRAIN IS STILL

00:48:58.635 --> 00:49:00.537
YOUNG AND SHE HAS A COUPLE MORE

00:49:00.604 --> 00:49:02.205

RANGING SYMPTOMS OF AFFECTED ME

01:02:25.274 --> 01:02:27.110
FROM HEAD TO TOE I SPENT MONTHS

01:02:27.176 --> 01:02:28.244
TRYING TO GET A DOCTOR'S

01:02:28.311 --> 01:02:29.679
APPOINTMENTS AND MEETINGS WITH

01:02:29.745 --> 01:02:32.048
SPECIALISTS. IN WHAT FEELS LIKE

01:02:32.115 --> 01:02:33.683
A GAME OF WHACK A MOLE. AFTER

01:02:33.749 --> 01:02:35.751
WAITING FOR MORE THAN THREE TO

01:02:35.818 --> 01:02:36.986
FOUR MONTHS TO SEE A NEUROLOGIST

01:02:37.053 --> 01:02:39.889
MY SYMPTOMS MOVE TOO MUCH FROM

01:02:39.956 --> 01:02:40.490
MY BRAIN TO MY LUNGS. BY THE

01:02:40.556 --> 01:02:42.525
TIME I GOT TO MEET WITH THE

01:02:42.592 --> 01:02:43.593
PULMONOLOGIST MY SYMPTOMS HAD

01:02:43.659 --> 01:02:45.695
MOVED TO MY JOINTS AND SO ON. I

01:02:45.761 --> 01:02:47.630
REQUEST YOU REFERRALS TO SEE THE

01:02:47.697 --> 01:02:49.699
LONG HOPING UNITED UCSF. BUT

01:02:49.765 --> 01:02:51.334
INITIALLY DIDN'T QUALIFY BECAUSE

01:02:51.400 --> 01:02:53.302
I WAS NEVER HOSPITALIZED. I'M

01:02:53.369 --> 01:02:54.337
NOT ON THE LIST FOR AN

01:02:54.403 --> 01:02:55.505
APPOINTMENT WITH YOUR SCHEDULE

01:02:55.571 --> 01:02:57.907
MORE THAN NINE MONTHS AGO AND

01:02:57.974 --> 01:03:01.811
UCSF HAS ALREADY CANCELLED. ONCE

01:03:01.878 --> 01:03:02.411
I'M STILL WAITING. I'VE BEEN

01:03:02.478 --> 01:03:03.980
LIVING WITH LONG COVERED FOR

01:03:04.046 --> 01:03:05.181
ALMOST TWO YEARS NOW AND HAVE

01:03:05.248 --> 01:03:07.250
YET TO BEAT ME WITH ANY MULTI

01:03:07.316 --> 01:03:08.151
DISCIPLINARY DOCTORS WHO CAN

01:03:08.217 --> 01:03:09.685
HELP ME TO UNDERSTAND. IN FACT

01:03:09.752 --> 01:03:11.921
THE LONG CALL BUT IS HAVING ON

01:03:11.988 --> 01:03:13.656
MY BODY. AND WHAT IF ANYTHING I

01:03:13.723 --> 01:03:16.926
CAN DO TO TREAT IT. THE IMPACT

01:03:16.993 --> 01:03:19.295
OF HAVING LONGER BUT IT'S HAD ON

01:03:19.362 --> 01:03:21.030
ME MENTALLY AND PHYSICALLY IT'S

01:03:21.097 --> 01:03:21.831
HARD TO QUANTIFY. BUT I FEEL

01:03:21.898 --> 01:03:23.566
COMPARATIVELY LUCKY MANY PEOPLE

01:03:23.633 --> 01:03:25.735
WITH LONG KOBE HAVE HAD FAR MORE

01:03:25.801 --> 01:03:26.936
DEVELOPED DEBILITATING

01:03:27.003 --> 01:03:29.405
DEBILITATING EXPERIENCES. AND

01:03:29.472 --> 01:03:37.046
I'VE NOT BEEN ABLE TO WORK. AT

01:03:37.113 --> 01:03:39.315
ALL. THIS HAS TAKEN IT. ON MY-

01:03:39.382 --> 01:03:41.551
AND I. TO TAKE FARM SICK THAN

01:03:41.617 --> 01:03:42.552
EVER. YOU KNOW THINK. AND I

01:03:42.618 --> 01:03:43.553
CHANGING. AND DOCTORS AND- I'VE

01:03:43.619 --> 01:03:45.388
OPTED OUT OF CERTAIN CAREER

01:03:45.454 --> 01:03:46.055
OPPORTUNITY. I'M CONCERNED THAT

01:03:46.122 --> 01:03:47.290
THAT SYMPTOMS MIGHT RETURN. AND

01:03:47.356 --> 01:03:50.226
I MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO PERFORM

01:03:50.293 --> 01:03:51.627
THE TASKS NECESSARY. DESPITE THE

01:03:51.694 --> 01:03:54.430
SETBACKS I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO

01:03:54.497 --> 01:03:55.364
KEEP WORKING BECAUSE I HAVE A

01:03:55.431 --> 01:03:56.766
JOB THAT OFFERS FLEXIBILITY

01:03:56.832 --> 01:03:58.100
MAKES REASONABLE ACCOMMODATIONS

01:03:58.167 --> 01:04:00.102
FOR PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. IF

01:04:00.169 --> 01:04:01.938
I WERE IN A DIFFERENT WORKPLACE

01:04:02.004 --> 01:04:02.505
REFUSE TO OFFER THESE

01:04:02.572 --> 01:04:05.708
ACCOMMODATIONS I MAY HAVE NEEDED

01:04:05.775 --> 01:04:08.010
TO QUIT SEVERAL MONTHS AGO.

01:04:08.077 --> 01:04:09.712
THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT THIS IS

01:04:09.779 --> 01:04:11.347
ONE OF THE MOST DISABLING

01:04:11.414 --> 01:04:13.449
ADVANCE IN UNITED STATES HISTORY

01:04:13.516 --> 01:04:14.383
. AND THE DISPROPORTIONATE

01:04:14.450 --> 01:04:16.285
IMPACT THE CODE NINETEEN HAS HAD

01:04:16.352 --> 01:04:17.587
ON UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES AND

01:04:17.653 --> 01:04:19.555
COMMUNITIES OF COLOR ESPECIALLY

01:04:19.622 --> 01:04:21.190
THE BLACK LIKE NEXT IN AMERICAN

01:04:21.257 --> 01:04:22.959
INDIAN COMMUNITIES. MAKES THE

01:04:23.025 --> 01:04:24.060
NEED TO RESPOND TO THIS

01:04:24.126 --> 01:04:25.995
DISABLING EVENT IN A WAY THAT'S

01:04:26.062 --> 01:04:27.263
SQUARELY ADDRESSES SOCIO

01:04:27.330 --> 01:04:30.233
ECONOMIC INEQUALITY ABSOLUTELY

01:04:30.299 --> 01:04:32.602
VITAL. BASED ON MY OWN

01:04:32.668 --> 01:04:34.203
EXPERIENCES IN THE WORK I'VE

01:04:34.270 --> 01:04:36.038
DONE A DISABILITY RIGHTS

01:04:36.105 --> 01:04:36.973
CALIFORNIA FOR MANY STATES

01:04:37.039 --> 01:04:38.574
THAT'S THE CALIFORNIA MUST HATE

01:04:38.641 --> 01:04:40.409
TO ADDRESS THIS CRISIS. WE'VE

01:04:40.476 --> 01:04:42.111
ALREADY FEEL HEARD A FEW OF

01:04:42.178 --> 01:04:44.280
THOSE AND I JUST WANNA ECHO

01:04:44.347 --> 01:04:46.515
SUPPORT. I'M BUILDING ON WHAT

01:04:46.582 --> 01:04:47.516
SEVERAL OTHER PANELISTS AMARI

01:04:47.583 --> 01:04:49.552
SAID. FIRST THERE NEEDS TO BE

01:04:49.619 --> 01:04:50.620
CLEAR RECOGNITION THAT LONG CODE

01:04:50.686 --> 01:04:52.255
CAN BE DEEMED A DISABILITY UNDER

01:04:52.321 --> 01:04:53.289
THE AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES

01:04:53.356 --> 01:04:55.091
ACT. WHICH TRIGGERS THE NEED TO

01:04:55.157 --> 01:04:57.226
PROVIDE ACCOMMODATIONS. DESPITE

01:04:57.293 --> 01:04:58.861
THE OFTEN INVISIBLE NATURE OF

01:04:58.928 --> 01:05:00.529
THIS CONDITION IT MUST BE CLEAR

01:05:00.596 --> 01:05:02.098
TO BUSINESSES SCHOOLS AND

01:05:02.164 --> 01:05:04.166
EMPLOYERS. THE PEOPLE WHOSE LONG

01:05:04.233 --> 01:05:05.668
COVERED QUALIFIES AS A

01:05:05.735 --> 01:05:06.736
DISABILITY MUST BE AFFORDED THE

01:05:06.802 --> 01:05:08.004
SAME PROTECTIONS FROM

01:05:08.070 --> 01:05:09.772
DISCRIMINATION. THE REASON

01:05:09.839 --> 01:05:11.474
ACCOMMODATIONS AS ANY OTHER

01:05:11.540 --> 01:05:14.443
PERSON WITH A DISABILITY UNDER

01:05:14.510 --> 01:05:16.312
THE ADA AND REHABILITATION.

01:05:16.379 --> 01:05:18.114
THERE ALSO NEEDS TO BE FAR MORE

01:05:18.180 --> 01:05:19.582
RESEARCH ON LONG PROBATE THIS IS

01:05:19.649 --> 01:05:20.816
A BIG FOCUS ON UNDERSERVED

01:05:20.883 --> 01:05:22.952
COMMUNITIES COMMUNITIES OF COLOR

01:05:23.019 --> 01:05:25.187
AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES AND

01:05:25.254 --> 01:05:27.156
UNDERLYING HEALTH CONDITIONS.

01:05:27.223 --> 01:05:28.524
AND AS WE'VE ALREADY HEARD THERE

01:05:28.591 --> 01:05:29.925
IS A NEED FOR EXPANDED TREATMENT

01:05:29.992 --> 01:05:31.594
OPTIONS INCLUDE MULTI

01:05:31.661 --> 01:05:33.162
DISCIPLINARY TREATMENT TEAMS

01:05:33.229 --> 01:05:35.298
ACCESS CENTERS OF EXCELLENCE.

01:05:35.364 --> 01:05:36.832
BUT A REDUCTION OF UNNECESSARY

01:05:36.899 --> 01:05:37.700
BARRIERS TO TREATMENT AND

01:05:37.767 --> 01:05:38.668
REIMBURSEMENT SUCH AS

01:05:38.734 --> 01:05:39.902
ELIMINATING THE NEED FOR

01:05:39.969 --> 01:05:42.738
HOSPITALIZATION OR PROOF OF THE

01:05:42.805 --> 01:05:44.607
POSITIVE CONTEST. AND THERE HAS

01:05:44.674 --> 01:05:46.142
TO BE CONTINUOUS FEEDBACK LOOP

01:05:46.208 --> 01:05:47.777
WITH LEADING REPRESENTATIVES OF

01:05:47.843 --> 01:05:49.345
THE PATIENT COMMUNITIES

01:05:49.412 --> 01:05:51.080
INFORMING RESEARCH AND POLICY

01:05:51.147 --> 01:05:54.317
DECISIONS. HOW MANY OF TE

01:05:54.383 --> 01:05:55.551
PROBLEMS THAT PEOPLE WITH LONG

01:05:55.618 --> 01:05:57.753
KOBE AND ARE EXPERIENCING ARE

01:05:57.820 --> 01:05:59.455
NOT NEW TO THE DISABILITY

01:05:59.522 --> 01:06:00.589
COMMUNITY. THIS IS A NEWLY

01:06:00.656 --> 01:06:03.092
POLITICAL PROBLEM GIVEN HOW MANY

01:06:03.159 --> 01:06:04.293
MORE PEOPLE ARE NOW GOING TO BE

01:06:04.360 --> 01:06:06.696
IMPACTED. FOR ME THE SCARIEST

01:06:06.762 --> 01:06:08.497
PART OF ALL OF THIS IS THAT WE

01:06:08.564 --> 01:06:10.366
HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THE FUTURE

01:06:10.433 --> 01:06:11.867
HOLDS. WHILE I AM THANKFULLY

01:06:11.934 --> 01:06:13.969
ONLY EXPERIENCING WHAT SEEMED TO

01:06:14.036 --> 01:06:14.603
BE MINOR LONG COVERED SOMETHING

01:06:14.670 --> 01:06:17.506
RIGHT NOW. I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT

01:06:17.573 --> 01:06:19.642
TOMORROW NEXT MONTH OR NEXT YEAR

01:06:19.709 --> 01:06:20.910
MIGHT BRING. WHETHER LONG

01:06:20.976 --> 01:06:22.211
COVERED WILL BECOME A LIFELONG

01:06:22.278 --> 01:06:24.246
CHRONIC CONDITION FOR ME EARLY

01:06:24.313 --> 01:06:26.282
TO EARLY MORTALITY. WHETHER MY

01:06:26.349 --> 01:06:28.417
TIME WITH MY TWO YOUNG CHILDREN

01:06:28.484 --> 01:06:30.753
WILL BE CUT SHORT OR MY ABILITY

01:06:30.820 --> 01:06:31.921
TO BUILD A MEANINGFUL CAREER WE

01:06:31.987 --> 01:06:35.091
HOLD. NO ONE KNOWS. I HOPE THAT

01:06:35.157 --> 01:06:36.359
OTERS DON'T HAVE TO CONTINUE TO

01:06:36.425 --> 01:06:37.526
NAVIGATE THESE TERRIFYING

01:06:37.593 --> 01:06:39.962
QUESTIONS IN A WAY THAT I HAVE

01:06:40.029 --> 01:06:44.767

THREE AMAZING WOMEN WHO SHARED

01:07:22.238 --> 01:07:24.240
THEIR STORIES ALL AT DIFFERENT

01:07:24.306 --> 01:07:27.042
POINTS IN THEIR LIFE. AND I JUST

01:07:27.109 --> 01:07:29.178
HOPE AS HARD AS IT MAY BE THAT

01:07:29.245 --> 01:07:30.246
THEY WILL KEEP SHARING THEIR

01:07:30.312 --> 01:07:32.782
STORIES. BECAUSE I'VE HEARD OF

01:07:32.848 --> 01:07:34.517
LONG COVERT BUT HEARING THE

01:07:34.583 --> 01:07:36.619
ACTUAL DETAILS AND HOW

01:07:36.685 --> 01:07:38.921
DISRUPTIVE IT IS TO THEIR LIVES

01:07:38.988 --> 01:07:40.723
WE ALL NEED TO HEAR THAT SO THAT

01:07:40.790 --> 01:07:42.425
WE UNDERSTAND THAT IT'S REAL.

01:07:42.491 --> 01:07:44.527
THAT IS HAPPENING AND THAT WE

01:07:44.593 --> 01:07:47.062
HAVE TO FIND A WAY TO TACKLE IT.

01:07:47.129 --> 01:07:48.497
I DON'T REMEMBER WHICH OF THE

01:07:48.564 --> 01:07:49.498
THREE WOMEN STATED THAT ONE

01:07:49.565 --> 01:07:51.934
POINT SIX MILLION. PEOPLE ARE

OUT OF WORK RIGHT NOW DUE TO

01:07:53.369 --> 01:07:55.271
LONG COVE IT. I THINK THAT WAS

01:07:55.337 --> 01:07:57.873
SHOCKING TO ME AND IT- THAT

01:07:57.940 --> 01:08:00.309
PROBABLY HELPS US UNDERSTAND WHY

01:08:00.376 --> 01:08:01.710
THERE'S SUCH A SHORTAGE OF

01:08:01.777 --> 01:08:03.612
WORKERS RIGHT NOW. WHEN WE ADD

01:08:03.679 --> 01:08:06.115
THAT TO THE ALMOST ONE. MILLION

01:08:06.182 --> 01:08:07.950
PEOPLE WHO HAVE DIED DUE TO A

01:08:08.017 --> 01:08:10.419
COVERED- IT'S NO WONDER THAT

01:08:10.486 --> 01:08:11.387

SHARING THEIR STORY I KNOW IT'S

01:08:31.307 --> 01:08:33.976
NOT EASY BUT I THINK IT'S

01:08:34.043 --> 01:08:35.144
IMPORTANT THAT THEY DO. YOU KNOW

01:08:35.211 --> 01:08:37.646
WHAT. REALLY SET OUT TO ME AS I

01:08:37.713 --> 01:08:40.883
BELIEVE THAT- SOME OF THE- THE

01:08:40.950 --> 01:08:42.017
TWO LADIES I SPOKE FIRST SAID

01:08:42.084 --> 01:08:43.853
THAT THEY HAD ALREADY BEEN

01:08:43.919 --> 01:08:44.887
BOOSTED AND THEN THEY GOT COLD

01:08:44.954 --> 01:08:46.155
FEET AGAIN AND I JUST WANT TO

01:08:46.222 --> 01:08:47.623
REITERATE THAT SINCE THERE'S SO

01:08:47.690 --> 01:08:49.291
MUCH MISINFORMATION I HEAR IT

01:08:49.358 --> 01:08:51.660
CONSTANTLY. FROM OUR YOUTH AND

01:08:51.727 --> 01:08:53.128
ADULTS SAYING THAT THEY WANT TO

01:08:53.195 --> 01:08:55.197
GET COVERAGE IS TO GET IT OVER

01:08:55.264 --> 01:08:56.232
WITH AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE

01:08:56.298 --> 01:08:58.267
THAT IT'S NOT JUST GETTING CALL

01:08:58.334 --> 01:08:59.468
OF IT. BUT IT'S ALSO DEALING

01:08:59.535 --> 01:09:01.337
WITH THESE LONG TERM EFFECTS AND

01:09:01.403 --> 01:09:03.005
THE FACT THAT THEY WERE GOT IT.

01:09:03.072 --> 01:09:04.139
AFTERTHEY WERE ALREADY SICK I

01:09:04.206 --> 01:09:06.075

01:09:21.423 --> 01:09:22.992
PERSPECTIVE AND I THINK THAT

01:09:23.058 --> 01:09:24.693
LEARNING FROM YOUR STORIES WE

01:09:24.760 --> 01:09:26.695

01:09:29.565 --> 01:09:31.867

IT FEELS LIKE THEY'RE YELLING

01:09:56.225 --> 01:09:59.795
INTO. THE VOID- ESPECIALLY FOR

01:09:59.862 --> 01:10:04.199
PEOPLE WHO- KAKU VERY EARLY- IN

01:10:04.266 --> 01:10:06.535
SPRING SUMMER TWENTY TWENTY-

01:10:06.602 --> 01:10:09.338
WHEN WE KNEW ALMOST NOT ME SO

01:10:09.405 --> 01:10:11.473
LITTLE ABOUT THIS VIRUS IN

01:10:11.540 --> 01:10:13.409
GENERAL AND WE WERE IN A FIRE

01:10:13.475 --> 01:10:17.146
DRILL EMERGENCY TRIAGE MODE- TO

TO STOP TO STOP THERE. IN OTHER

01:10:23.452 --> 01:10:25.087
LUNGS FROM DISSOLVING

01:10:25.154 --> 01:10:28.457
EFFECTIVELY- AND WE WERE NOT AS

01:10:28.524 --> 01:10:31.060
A SOCIETY REALLY PAYING- ENOUGH

01:10:31.126 --> 01:10:33.362
ATTENTION THE PEOPLE WHO HAD

01:10:33.429 --> 01:10:36.565
RECOVERED AND- IN QUOTES FOR

01:10:36.632 --> 01:10:38.167
COVERED UP OR NOT REALLY

01:10:38.233 --> 01:10:39.802
RECOVERED- AND WE'RE

01:10:39.868 --> 01:10:42.237
EXPERIENCING THESE LONG TERM.

01:10:42.304 --> 01:10:43.606
EFFECTS AND I KNOW IT'S IT WAS

01:10:43.672 --> 01:10:45.107
SO FRUSTRATING FOR SO MANY

01:10:45.174 --> 01:10:47.643
MONTHS STILL AS IN TERMS OF.

01:10:47.710 --> 01:10:49.745
GETTING THREE MEN AND SOMETIMES

01:10:49.812 --> 01:10:52.247
GETTING THE- HEALTHCARE SYSTEM

01:10:52.314 --> 01:10:54.316
TO TAKE THEM SERIOUSLY. AND WE

01:10:54.383 --> 01:10:56.352
KNOW THAT EVEN BEFORE COVERT FOR

01:10:56.418 --> 01:10:59.154
PEOPLE WITH POST VIRAL- SYMPTOMS

01:10:59.221 --> 01:11:01.223
WHETHER FROM A MONO OR OR FROM

01:11:01.290 --> 01:11:03.993
OTHER- VIRUSES THEY WERE NOT

01:11:04.059 --> 01:11:06.762
TAKEN- SERIOUSLY CONSISTENTLY

01:11:06.829 --> 01:11:08.163
AND PEOPLE WERE TOLD THAT THEY

01:11:08.230 --> 01:11:10.599
WERE SUPPOSED- HAD A MENTAL

01:11:10.666 --> 01:11:13.135
HEALTH ISSUE OR THEY WERE JUST-

01:11:13.202 --> 01:11:14.703
OVERLY SENSITIVE OR THEY WERE

01:11:14.770 --> 01:11:19.408
MAKING IT UP- AND- AND I THINK-

01:11:19.475 --> 01:11:21.043
ONE OF THE THERE'S NOTHING GOOD

01:11:21.110 --> 01:11:22.444
ABOUT COVERT BUT AT LEAST COVE

01:11:22.511 --> 01:11:23.879
IT HAS. SHINED A BRIGHT LIGHT

01:11:23.946 --> 01:11:28.984
ON- POST FILES- PROBLEMS ARE NOT

01:11:29.051 --> 01:11:30.486
JUST FOR COVERED BUT FOR OTHER

01:11:30.552 --> 01:11:33.022
VIRUSES AND I REALLY HOPE. THIS

01:11:33.088 --> 01:11:36.792
LEADS TO DRAMATIC INVESTMENT AND

01:11:36.859 --> 01:11:40.229
RESEARCH ODDS FIGURE OUT. HOW WE

01:11:40.295 --> 01:11:41.630
PREVENT THIS FROM HAPPENING WHEN

01:11:41.697 --> 01:11:43.332
SOMEONE HAS A VIRAL INFECTION

01:11:43.399 --> 01:11:44.967

FIRST PANEL AND- MAYBE WELL DO

01:12:02.451 --> 01:12:04.253
IS I'LL START WITH THAT FIRST

01:12:04.319 --> 01:12:06.188
WITH THEM THE STARK BECAUSE YOU

01:12:06.255 --> 01:12:07.923

01:12:07.990 --> 01:12:10.426
WEARING- DISABILITY RIGHTS AND-

01:12:10.492 --> 01:12:13.362

THE OTHER. WOMEN WHO SPOKE ON

01:12:30.512 --> 01:12:32.247
THEIR- ON THEIR JOURNEY WITH US.

01:12:32.314 --> 01:12:33.182
I JUST THINK IT'S REALLY

01:12:33.248 --> 01:12:34.349
IMPORTANT ONE I THINK THAT WAS

01:12:34.416 --> 01:12:36.085
BROUGHT UP THAT NEVER OCCURRED

01:12:36.151 --> 01:12:37.686
ME AND MY EDUCATIONAL HAT AND MY

01:12:37.753 --> 01:12:39.154
PARENTS HAD THE SAME TIME. IT

01:12:39.221 --> 01:12:40.289
CAN BE DONE PROBABLY VERY

01:12:40.355 --> 01:12:42.091
QUICKLY IS TO IDENTIFY WHAT WE

01:12:42.157 --> 01:12:44.159
CAN DO IN OUR SCHOOL SYSTEM TO

01:12:44.226 --> 01:12:46.462
HELP THESE KIDS- ONLY BECAUSE

01:12:46.528 --> 01:12:48.664
I'M AN EDUCATOR AND I KNEW. THAT

01:12:48.731 --> 01:12:49.765
WE COULD GO TO THE OPERA

01:12:49.832 --> 01:12:51.700
DISABILITY. THROUGH MY DAUGHTER

01:12:51.767 --> 01:12:53.535
TO THE UNIVERSITY TO GET HER

01:12:53.602 --> 01:12:55.571
EXTENDED TIME. EXCUSED ABSENCES

01:12:55.637 --> 01:12:57.473
BECAUSE SOME PROFESSOR STILL.

01:12:57.539 --> 01:13:02.411
LIKE STILL YOU. KNOW HE MISSED

01:13:02.478 --> 01:13:04.313
THREE CLASSES YOUR GREAT GOT. I

01:13:04.379 --> 01:13:06.281
WHEN IT. TO A DIFFERENT. BUT I

01:13:06.348 --> 01:13:07.015
THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT

01:13:07.082 --> 01:13:08.450
BECAUSE AT ONE POINT WE WERE

01:13:08.517 --> 01:13:10.886
TOLD BY THE UNIVERSITY COAL BED-

01:13:10.953 --> 01:13:12.554
WILL NO LONGER BE AN EXCUSE.

01:13:12.621 --> 01:13:14.590
MMHM AND THAT WAS VERY STARTLING

01:13:14.656 --> 01:13:16.091
BECAUSE SO THEN WE ACTUALLY HAD

01:13:16.158 --> 01:13:18.494
A OKAY SHE HAS ANXIETY. SO THAT

01:13:18.560 --> 01:13:20.028
WAS IT I DON'T THINK BUT

01:13:20.095 --> 01:13:21.096
COMFORTABLE WITH GIVE HER

01:13:21.163 --> 01:13:22.064
ACCOMMODATION BUT THEY DID NOT

01:13:22.131 --> 01:13:24.133
WANT YOU CALL THAT AS A- AS A

01:13:24.199 --> 01:13:25.734
WAY FOR HER TO GET.

01:13:25.801 --> 01:13:26.235
ACCOMMODATION THAT SHE

01:13:26.301 --> 01:13:28.504
ABSOLUTELY NEEDED TO HAVE AND-

01:13:28.570 --> 01:13:30.939
YOU KNOW AN EDUCATIONAL SETTING

01:13:31.006 --> 01:13:32.141
FOR K. THROUGH TWELVE I KNOW

01:13:32.207 --> 01:13:33.475
THAT WE CAN BE AFFECTION BIBLE

01:13:33.542 --> 01:13:34.877
PORTION THAT MAYBE SOMETHING

01:13:34.943 --> 01:13:36.044
THAT PARENTS DON'T EVEN KNOW

01:13:36.111 --> 01:13:37.479
WHAT'S AVAILABLE TO THEM- I

01:13:37.546 --> 01:13:38.981
SPEAKING FAST MAY NOT KNOW THAT

01:13:39.047 --> 01:13:40.682
THOSE ACCOMMODATIONS. ARE GOING

01:13:40.749 --> 01:13:42.584
TO BE NECESSARY FOR SOME OF THE

01:13:42.651 --> 01:13:43.652
KIDS- WHO ARE GOING TO BE

01:13:43.719 --> 01:13:45.654
TRAVELING WITH THEM I THINK IT'S

01:13:45.721 --> 01:13:49.491
VERY IMPORTANT TO GET THAT

01:13:49.558 --> 01:13:50.292
IDENTIFIED BY. MY POSITION THAT.

01:13:50.359 --> 01:13:51.326
THANK YOU THANKS VERY MUCH AND

01:13:51.393 --> 01:13:52.961

REFERRED TO THE QUESTION ABOUT

01:13:54.496 --> 01:13:55.731
THE PROS WHICH ACTUALLY INVOLVE

01:13:55.798 --> 01:13:57.166
ME ABOUT THESE I'M GONNA START

01:13:57.232 --> 01:13:59.601

DISABILITY RIGHTS- AND- THEN

01:14:06.942 --> 01:14:08.243
THEY GO OUT AND THEN WE'LL HAVE

01:14:08.310 --> 01:14:09.845
THIS VAST QUIZ AND ACTUALLY

01:14:09.912 --> 01:14:11.046
MYSTERIES IF YOU WISH TO.

01:14:11.113 --> 01:14:12.247
COMMENT ON IT AFTER HEARING THE

01:14:12.314 --> 01:14:13.582

VERY LIMITED TESTING AND I

01:14:26.428 --> 01:14:27.296
REMEMBER WHEN HE DIDN'T HAVE ANY

01:14:27.362 --> 01:14:29.431
TESTS. AND SOMETIMES EVEN NOW

01:14:29.498 --> 01:14:31.567
SOMETIMES IT'S A BIT OF A

01:14:31.633 --> 01:14:33.268
CHALLENGE TO- SO WHAT DO YOU SEE

01:14:33.335 --> 01:14:34.970
FROM FROM. THE POLICY POINT OF

01:14:35.037 --> 01:14:36.839
VIEW FROM. OUR PERSPECTIVE IS AS

01:14:36.905 --> 01:14:38.407
LEGISLATORS WE SHOULD BE DOING

01:14:38.473 --> 01:14:43.745

JUST CAN'T BE. COMPLETELY WIDE

01:14:53.522 --> 01:14:57.125
OPEN. BUT AND MAYBE THIS IS IT-

01:14:57.192 --> 01:14:59.828
BUT- BUT CLEARLY WE ALSO KNOW

01:14:59.895 --> 01:15:01.496
THAT IF WE HAVE DEFINITIONS LIKE

01:15:01.563 --> 01:15:03.232
YOU HAVE TO HAVE A POSITIVE

01:15:03.298 --> 01:15:04.399
TESTER AND BUYS OR SOMETHING IN

01:15:04.466 --> 01:15:06.068

WHAT DOES NOT WORK IN THIS

01:15:59.388 --> 01:16:00.722
CONTEXT SO AS YOU SAID.

01:16:00.789 --> 01:16:02.357
RECOGNIZING THAT TESTING WAS NOT

01:16:02.424 --> 01:16:03.358
AVAILABLE AND THAT THERE

01:16:03.425 --> 01:16:04.493
CONTINUE TO BE LIMITS WITH

01:16:04.559 --> 01:16:06.395
TESTING RECOGNIZING THAT.

01:16:06.461 --> 01:16:08.463
HOSPITALIZATION IS NOT A PROXY

01:16:08.530 --> 01:16:10.699
FOR- WHETHER OR NOT SOMEBODY CAN

01:16:10.766 --> 01:16:12.434
HAVE LONG PROGRAM. RECOGNIZING

01:16:12.501 --> 01:16:14.136
THAT ANTIBODIES IS NOT

01:16:14.202 --> 01:16:15.737
NECESSARILY PRESS THE STAR. I

01:16:15.804 --> 01:16:17.406
THINK LOOKING AT WHAT ARE THE

01:16:17.472 --> 01:16:18.473
SYMPTOMS EVEN IF IT'S IN

01:16:18.540 --> 01:16:22.444
PERFECT. THAT TEND TO- THEY TEND

01:16:22.511 --> 01:16:23.545
TO YOU KNOW CORRELATE TO

01:16:23.612 --> 01:16:26.682
WITNESS. AND NOT- CREATING.

01:16:26.748 --> 01:16:28.750
UNNECESSARY HURDLES. ON

01:16:28.817 --> 01:16:30.185
OBSTACLES PARTICULARLY

01:16:30.252 --> 01:16:32.254
RECOGNIZING THE TREMENDOUS-

01:16:32.321 --> 01:16:34.623
SOCIAL SOCIOECONOMIC INEQUALITY.

01:16:34.690 --> 01:16:37.492
THAT PREVENTS MANY PEOPLE FROM.

01:16:37.559 --> 01:16:39.261
I'M GOING THROUGH AND YOU KNOW.

01:16:39.328 --> 01:16:40.862
CHECKING THE BOXES THAT MIGHT

01:16:40.929 --> 01:16:42.531
OTHERWISE OTHERWISE NECESSARY.

01:16:42.597 --> 01:16:44.032
READ ALSO BE REALLY INTERESTING

01:16:44.099 --> 01:16:45.701
ISN'T VASQUEZ'S OPINION BECAUSE

01:16:45.767 --> 01:16:47.669
I FEEL LIKE. SHE HAS EVEN MORE

01:16:47.736 --> 01:16:49.338
EXPERIENCE IN THIS REALM AND I

01:16:49.404 --> 01:16:51.173
FEEL LIKE I HAVE WHILE I AM AN

01:16:51.239 --> 01:16:53.108
ATTORNEY AND I CAN TALK ABOUT.

01:16:53.175 --> 01:16:54.443
KNOW WHAT IS REQUIRED TO MAKE

01:16:54.509 --> 01:16:56.345
SURE THAT PEOPLE ARE YOU KNOW

01:16:56.411 --> 01:16:58.046
QUALIFY AS HAVING A DISABILITY

01:16:58.113 --> 01:16:59.047
UNDER THE ADA- I FEEL LIKE MUCH

01:16:59.114 --> 01:17:01.016
OF THAT MY EXPERIENCE HERE HAS

01:17:01.083 --> 01:17:05.253
BEEN. AS AN INDIVIDUAL NOT THE

01:17:05.320 --> 01:17:06.688
PATIENT. I'M I GUESS I WOULD

01:17:06.755 --> 01:17:08.523
JUST ADD ONE THAT. THE

01:17:08.590 --> 01:17:09.558
FRUSTRATE. OF FEELING LIKE I

01:17:09.624 --> 01:17:11.526
HAVE- DOES THE DESPERATION FOR

01:17:11.593 --> 01:17:13.261
TREATMENT THE DESPERATION FOR

01:17:13.328 --> 01:17:15.297
LIKE CREDIBILITY FOR PEOPLE TO

01:17:15.364 --> 01:17:17.666
BELIEVE WHAT I'M SAYING- AND NOT

01:17:17.733 --> 01:17:19.401
BEING ABLE TO POINT TO ANYTHING

01:17:19.468 --> 01:17:21.436
TANGIBLE HAS BEEN- A

01:17:21.503 --> 01:17:22.671
TREMENDOUSLY CHALLENGING PIECE

01:17:22.738 --> 01:17:26.108
OF THIS IS LED TO ALSO- YOU KNOW

01:17:26.174 --> 01:17:27.943
A LOT OF MENTAL HEALTH

01:17:28.010 --> 01:17:31.179
CHALLENGES. AND SO I THINK- JUST

01:17:31.246 --> 01:17:33.915
RECOGNIZING THE WAY THAT- STIGMA

01:17:33.982 --> 01:17:35.717
PLAYS INTO THEIR EYES AND

01:17:35.784 --> 01:17:37.219
RECOGNIZING THAT- YOU KNOW SOME

01:17:37.285 --> 01:17:39.554
OF THE NEED TO. DEFINE PEOPLE

01:17:39.621 --> 01:17:42.424
CAN LEAD TO ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES

01:17:42.491 --> 01:17:46.461
AND ALSO MAKE IT MORE OR- LESS

01:17:46.528 --> 01:17:47.229
LIKELY THAT PEOPLE EVEN CARE.

01:17:47.295 --> 01:17:49.164
THANK YOU THANK YOU AND I AND

01:17:49.231 --> 01:17:50.232
AGAIN I. T. SERVICES ARE I THINK

01:17:50.298 --> 01:17:52.434
OUR EXPERTS HAD MENTIONED- THE

01:17:52.501 --> 01:17:53.769
FIRST PANEL MENTIONED THAT

01:17:53.835 --> 01:17:55.203
CERTAINLY COMES EVEN PEOPLE VERY

01:17:55.270 --> 01:17:57.472
MILDER PRACTICALLY SYMPTOMATIC.

01:17:57.539 --> 01:17:59.274
CAN ALSO DEVELOP LONG CODES OF

01:17:59.341 --> 01:18:02.411
THIS IDEA OF HOSPITALIZATION IS

01:18:02.477 --> 01:18:03.879
THE THRESHOLD OF THE SOUTHWEST.

01:18:03.945 --> 01:18:05.647
YES ON THE TAKE A GREAT

01:18:05.714 --> 01:18:08.150
QUESTION- THAT THE FIRST THING

01:18:08.216 --> 01:18:10.018
I'LL I'LL NOTE IS THAT- IT'S

01:18:10.085 --> 01:18:11.119
REALLY IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER

01:18:11.186 --> 01:18:14.990
THAT IN THE BODIES- ARE ARE. NOT

01:18:15.057 --> 01:18:17.392
THE BEST WAY TO- IDENTIFY A

01:18:17.459 --> 01:18:19.861
PREVIOUS INSPECTION- AND IN FACT

01:18:19.928 --> 01:18:21.763
ESPECIALLY IN LONG COALBED THERE

01:18:21.830 --> 01:18:23.031
SEEMS TO BE SOME SORT OF

01:18:23.098 --> 01:18:25.267
CONNECTION BETWEEN NOT- WHAT'S

01:18:25.333 --> 01:18:26.568
CALLED CERRO CONVERTING NOT

01:18:26.635 --> 01:18:28.837
CREATING ANTIBODIES- OR

01:18:28.904 --> 01:18:31.239
SUFFICIENT ANTIBODIES OR TIMELY

01:18:31.306 --> 01:18:33.341
ANTIBODIES. AND LONG COVERT

01:18:33.408 --> 01:18:35.911
SYMPTOMS AGAIN PROBABLY NOT BE

01:18:35.977 --> 01:18:37.846
THE SAME THAT CAUSES LONG HOLD

01:18:37.913 --> 01:18:39.014
IT BUT THERE'S CERTAINLY SOME

01:18:39.081 --> 01:18:40.749
ASSOCIATION AND IT SEEMS REALLY

01:18:40.816 --> 01:18:42.818
PREVALENT IN OUR COMMUNITY-

01:18:42.884 --> 01:18:44.953
ALONG WITH PATIENTS WHERE-

01:18:45.020 --> 01:18:46.388
DESPITE NO MATTER WHEN WE'RE

01:18:46.455 --> 01:18:48.757
BEING TESTED WE ARE NOT- WE ARE

01:18:48.824 --> 01:18:51.326
NOT- AT PRODUCING. A DETECTABLE

01:18:51.393 --> 01:18:53.528
ANTIBODIES SO I REALLY REALLY

01:18:53.595 --> 01:18:55.130
WANT TO CAUTION POLICYMAKERS

01:18:55.197 --> 01:18:58.967
FROM- FROM USING TESTING AS A

01:18:59.034 --> 01:19:00.869
MEANS OF GATE KEEPING BOTH OUR

01:19:00.936 --> 01:19:03.472
CLINICAL CARE. RESEARCH COHORTS

01:19:03.538 --> 01:19:06.541
AND- AND BENEFITS BASED ON

01:19:06.608 --> 01:19:08.210
TESTING BECAUSE IT'S JUST SIMPLY

01:19:08.276 --> 01:19:10.712
NOT SENSITIVE ENOUGH TO. PICK UP

01:19:10.779 --> 01:19:12.314
EVEN THE MAJORITY OF ONE CALL

01:19:12.380 --> 01:19:14.549
THAT PATIENT I WOULD I WOULD

01:19:14.616 --> 01:19:16.952
SAY- IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW HOW DO

01:19:17.018 --> 01:19:19.187
WE ENSURE THAT FOLKS. ARE YOU

01:19:19.254 --> 01:19:22.324
KNOW. TRULY SICK TO GET- GET

01:19:22.390 --> 01:19:24.092
BACK THE FIFTH I WOULD I WOULD

01:19:24.159 --> 01:19:25.494
CHALLENGE POLICYMAKERS TO THINK

01:19:25.560 --> 01:19:27.696
ABOUT THE HISTORY OF MEDICAL GAS

01:19:27.762 --> 01:19:30.632
LIGHTING AND- UNDERMINING OUR

01:19:30.699 --> 01:19:32.667
PATIENT- NARRATIVES OF THEIR OWN

01:19:32.734 --> 01:19:34.369
ILLNESS AND REALLY CHALLENGE.

01:19:34.436 --> 01:19:35.704
YOU KNOW THE STATE AND POLICY

01:19:35.770 --> 01:19:39.207
MAKERS TO BELIEVE PATIENTS AND-

01:19:39.274 --> 01:19:40.709
YOU KNOW THEY ARE THE EXPERTS ON

01:19:40.775 --> 01:19:42.377
THEIR OWN EXPERIENCE AND THEIR

01:19:42.444 --> 01:19:45.547
BODIES I MEAN THERE WAS A HUGE-

01:19:45.614 --> 01:19:47.949
THERE'S A HUGE HISTORY OF. NOT

01:19:48.016 --> 01:19:50.018
JUST UNDERMINING WOMEN'S HEALTH

01:19:50.085 --> 01:19:51.486
EXPERIENCES AND DIMINISHING

01:19:51.553 --> 01:19:54.222
THEIR PAIN AND THEIR- THEIR

01:19:54.289 --> 01:19:55.056
NARRATIVES OF THEIR OWN

01:19:55.123 --> 01:19:57.425
SUFFERING- BUT THERE IS ALSO A

01:19:57.492 --> 01:20:07.235
VERY- A VERY STRONG- ANTI- AIDS. MOVEMENT IT'S THE NIHILISM

01:20:07.302 --> 01:20:08.336
EVEN JUST FOR RECENTLY SO I IT

01:20:08.403 --> 01:20:10.872
IS. IT FOR ME. I A DIAGNOSIS

01:20:10.939 --> 01:20:11.840
ONCE- ESPECIALLY ONCE IT'S

01:20:11.907 --> 01:20:14.910
DEVELOPED- MUST BE INCLUSIVE

01:20:14.976 --> 01:20:16.912
THAT MUST BE INCLUDED IN SORT OF

01:20:16.978 --> 01:20:20.282
BENEFITS EVALUATION- FOR EXAMPLE

01:20:20.348 --> 01:20:22.918
THERE'S NO TEST TO- DEFINE

01:20:22.984 --> 01:20:25.487
MIGRAINE. BUT PEOPLE THERE ARE

01:20:25.554 --> 01:20:27.289
PEOPLE WHO ARE DISABLED AND NOT

01:20:27.355 --> 01:20:29.457
FIND MY GREEN TO RECEIVE LONG

01:20:29.524 --> 01:20:31.993
TERM DISABILITY BENEFITS AND SO

01:20:32.060 --> 01:20:33.428
I WOULD REALLY STRONGLY

01:20:33.495 --> 01:20:34.763
ENCOURAGE US AGAIN IF

01:20:34.829 --> 01:20:36.998
POLICYMAKERS TO ACCEPT THAT LONG

01:20:37.065 --> 01:20:38.500
HOPE IT CAN BE CLINICALLY

01:20:38.567 --> 01:20:40.969
DEFINED BY. YOU KNOW SOMEONE WHO

01:20:41.036 --> 01:20:43.238
KNOWS WHAT TO LOOK FOR BY YOU

01:20:43.305 --> 01:20:46.841
KNOW BY POST BY ROLE. AT EXPERT.

01:20:46.908 --> 01:20:49.411
AND NOT SPOTS WHERE I WOULD PUSH

01:20:49.477 --> 01:20:50.345
POLICYMAKERS TO GO IS TO CREATE

01:20:50.412 --> 01:20:52.380
A STRONG CLINICAL DEFINITION OF

01:20:52.447 --> 01:20:54.182
ONE KOVIC AND THEN EDUCATE

01:20:54.249 --> 01:20:56.618
DISABILITY- ADMINISTRATORS AND

01:20:56.685 --> 01:20:58.987
AUDITORS BECAUSE OFTEN WHAT I'VE

01:20:59.054 --> 01:21:00.422
HEARD FROM OTHER PATIENTS I

01:21:00.488 --> 01:21:01.523
MYSELF HAVE NOT. APPLIED FOR

01:21:01.590 --> 01:21:02.891
DISABILITY BENEFITS ALTHOUGH I

01:21:02.958 --> 01:21:04.526
HAVE I DO HAVE ACCOMMODATIONS

01:21:04.593 --> 01:21:07.229
FOR MY EMPLOYER- DIET THAT

01:21:07.295 --> 01:21:10.165
DISABILITY EVALUATORS ARE OFTEN

01:21:10.232 --> 01:21:11.733
QUICK TO UNDERMINE CLINICAL

01:21:11.800 --> 01:21:14.903
DIAGNOSES- EVEN WHEN DOCTORS ARE

01:21:14.970 --> 01:21:17.272
ARE ARE VERY THOROUGH AND FOR

01:21:17.339 --> 01:21:19.241
RENT AND DOCUMENTING A PATIENT'S

01:21:19.307 --> 01:21:21.343
DISABILITY IS- SO I THINK THERE

01:21:21.409 --> 01:21:23.345
NEEDS TO BE NOT JUST. EDUCATION

01:21:23.411 --> 01:21:25.747
ON THAT CLINICIANS WHO ARE YOU

01:21:25.814 --> 01:21:27.182
KNOW SUPPORTING PATIENTS IN

01:21:27.249 --> 01:21:28.850
APPLYING FOR DISABILITY BENEFITS

01:21:28.917 --> 01:21:31.786
BUT WE NEED A MASSIVE. EDUCATION

01:21:31.853 --> 01:21:33.455
EFFORT ON DISABILITY

01:21:33.521 --> 01:21:36.725
ADMINISTRATORS AND AUDITORS- WHO

01:21:36.791 --> 01:21:38.593
WHO EVALUATE THESE CLAIMS AND

01:21:38.660 --> 01:21:41.062
MAKE DECISIONS BECAUSE- I THINK

01:21:41.129 --> 01:21:42.831
ALSO A LOT OF INSTITUTIONAL

01:21:42.897 --> 01:21:44.466
GENDER BIAS AND RACE AND

01:21:44.532 --> 01:21:46.101
ETHNICITY BIAS OFTEN COME INTO

01:21:46.167 --> 01:21:47.435
PLAY WHEN EVALUATING THESE

01:21:47.502 --> 01:21:49.304
CLAIMS AS WELL. AND THAT'S IT

BETTER DUE TO PEOPLE THAT NEED

01:22:08.456 --> 01:22:09.124

01:29:21.389 --> 01:29:23.357
SO WE WANT TO ADOPT A MULTI

01:29:23.424 --> 01:29:24.592
FACETED APPROACH TO MEASURING

01:29:24.659 --> 01:29:26.194
THE BURDEN OF POST CODE

01:29:26.260 --> 01:29:27.528
CONDITIONS IN THE STATE. THERE

01:29:27.595 --> 01:29:28.496
ARE DIFFERENT STRATEGIES THAT

01:29:28.563 --> 01:29:29.664
WILL BE NEEDED TO ASSESS THE

01:29:29.731 --> 01:29:32.233
IMPACTS AND OF THE CODE NINETEEN

01:29:32.300 --> 01:29:33.835
PANDEMIC IN CALIFORNIA. WE COULD

01:29:33.901 --> 01:29:35.303
ACTUALLY WORK TO DEVELOP THE

01:29:35.369 --> 01:29:36.304
CALIFORNIA CONSENSUS CASE

01:29:36.370 --> 01:29:37.271
DEFINITION AND CONSIDER MAKING

01:29:37.338 --> 01:29:38.539
CLOTHES BECAUSE THE CONDITIONS

01:29:38.606 --> 01:29:39.373
REPORTABLE DISEASE IN

01:29:39.440 --> 01:29:42.143
CALIFORNIA. WE ALSO COULD USE A

01:29:42.210 --> 01:29:43.478
CASE CONTROL STUDY FRAMEWORK TO

01:29:43.544 --> 01:29:44.846
GATHER DATA ON POST CODE

01:29:44.912 --> 01:29:46.280
CONDITIONS AND THIS WOULD ALLOW

01:29:46.347 --> 01:29:47.582
FOR DATA COLLECTION FROM A

01:29:47.648 --> 01:29:48.616
REPRESENTATIVE SAMPLE OF STATE

01:29:48.683 --> 01:29:51.252
RESIDENTS WITH AND WITHOUT

01:29:51.319 --> 01:29:52.186
HISTORY OF INFECTION. AND THEN

01:29:52.253 --> 01:29:53.755
AS I OPEN WITH ME REALLY ALSO

01:29:53.821 --> 01:29:55.523
WANT TO STUDY THE BROADER

01:29:55.590 --> 01:29:56.691
SOCIETAL IMPLICATIONS OF THIS

01:29:56.758 --> 01:29:57.425
PANDEMIC. WE ARE CONSIDERING

01:29:57.492 --> 01:29:59.160
THAT IT JUST SAYS THAT BROADER

01:29:59.227 --> 01:30:00.428
IMPACT AND HOPE TO LAUNCH

01:30:00.495 --> 01:30:01.496
EFFORTS WITHIN THE NEXT SIX

01:30:01.562 --> 01:30:02.964
MONTHS. IMPORTANT QUESTIONS TO

01:30:03.030 --> 01:30:04.232
CONSIDER ARE THE IMPACTS ON

01:30:04.298 --> 01:30:06.000
PERSONS WHO LOST FAMILY MEMBERS.

01:30:06.067 --> 01:30:07.635
DEFERRAL OF CARE FOR CHRONIC

01:30:07.702 --> 01:30:08.603
DISEASES DIFFER- HEALTH

01:30:08.669 --> 01:30:09.937
SCREENINGS. MENTAL HEALTH

01:30:10.004 --> 01:30:11.105
IMPACTS AND LOSS OF TIME AT

01:30:11.172 --> 01:30:12.740
SCHOOL FOR CHILDREN. WILL

01:30:12.807 --> 01:30:14.175
PARTNER WITH FEDERAL AND OR

01:30:14.242 --> 01:30:15.710
ACADEMIC ORGANIZATIONS ON BROAD

01:30:15.777 --> 01:30:17.411
SURVEYS OF PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA.

01:30:17.478 --> 01:30:18.713
POLICY ASSESSMENTS AND OTHER

01:30:18.780 --> 01:30:20.314
COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH TO ASSESS

01:30:20.381 --> 01:30:23.284
THE IMPACTS OF THIS PANDEMIC ON

01:30:23.351 --> 01:30:24.218
CALIFORNIANS. WE'RE VERY

01:30:24.285 --> 01:30:25.319
COGNIZANT OF SOCIETAL

01:30:25.386 --> 01:30:26.687
IMPLICATIONS BEYOND PUBLIC

01:30:26.754 --> 01:30:28.222
HEALTH INCLUDING THE NEED TO

01:30:28.289 --> 01:30:29.690
CONSIDER ACCESSIBILITY

01:30:29.757 --> 01:30:31.392
ADAPTABILITY AND ACCOMMODATIONS

01:30:31.459 --> 01:30:33.427
AND SURVIVORS TELLING LIES. AS

01:30:33.494 --> 01:30:34.896
IT RELATES TO EDUCATION

01:30:34.962 --> 01:30:37.498
EMPLOYMENT AND MORE. I OPPOSED

01:30:37.565 --> 01:30:38.366
TO CONSERVE PAPER US FOR

01:30:38.432 --> 01:30:39.534
ADDITIONAL INPUT AND FEEDBACK BY

01:30:39.600 --> 01:30:41.235
MARCH EIGHTEENTH AFTER WHICH

01:30:41.302 --> 01:30:43.337
TIME A LOT OF WORK GROUP OF

01:30:43.404 --> 01:30:44.338
PARTNERS AND FURTHER DEFINE

01:30:44.405 --> 01:30:45.940
PRIORITY STUDIES TO- RESOURCE

01:30:46.007 --> 01:30:48.009
AND WORK ON. AND I WAS STUCK

01:30:48.075 --> 01:30:49.944
THERE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK

01:30:50.011 --> 01:30:52.713
YOU SO MUCH LOCKED UPON A NOTES

01:30:52.780 --> 01:30:55.950
MOVE ONTO DR ELMAR. WITH A VIEW

01:30:56.017 --> 01:31:00.254
TO. UCLA WELCOME. THANK YOU.

01:31:00.321 --> 01:31:03.958
WELL I AM WAS ASKED TODAY TO

01:31:04.025 --> 01:31:06.694
TALK ABOUT THE INSPIRE STUDY AND

01:31:06.761 --> 01:31:08.262
I WANT TO STEP BACK AND SAY

01:31:08.329 --> 01:31:11.933
THAT- ONE OF THE BENEFITS OF THE

01:31:11.999 --> 01:31:14.335
PANDEMIC IS IT'S BRINGING US ALL

01:31:14.402 --> 01:31:16.204
TOGETHER IT'S BRINGING

01:31:16.270 --> 01:31:18.372
LEGISLATORS AND PATIENTS AND

01:31:18.439 --> 01:31:20.308
FAMILY MEMBERS AND CLINICIANS

01:31:20.374 --> 01:31:22.243
AND SCIENTISTS WE ALL HAVE A

01:31:22.310 --> 01:31:24.145
COMMON GOAL AND WE WANT TO WORK

01:31:24.212 --> 01:31:26.280
ON THIS TOGETHER AND I THINK BY

01:31:26.347 --> 01:31:29.517
JOINING FORCES AS UCLA HAS DONE

01:31:29.584 --> 01:31:31.419
WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT

01:31:31.485 --> 01:31:33.921
OF PUBLIC HEALTH IN OUR ONE

01:31:33.988 --> 01:31:36.123
STUDY. YOU KNOW I THINK TOGETHER

01:31:36.190 --> 01:31:38.659
THE OUTCOME WILL BE BETTER SO IT

01:31:38.726 --> 01:31:40.194
HAS BEEN A PLEASURE

01:31:40.261 --> 01:31:42.330
COLLABORATING WITH THE STATE I

01:31:42.396 --> 01:31:44.198
WILL REFER EVERYONE TO OUR

01:31:44.265 --> 01:31:46.601
WEBSITE FOR UCLA STUDY IT'S

01:31:46.667 --> 01:31:49.170
INSPIRE LIKE TO BREED I. N. S.

01:31:49.237 --> 01:31:52.273
P. I. R. E. WE'RE RECRUITING OF

01:31:52.340 --> 01:31:53.774
QUITE A FEW THOUSAND PATIENTS

01:31:53.841 --> 01:31:55.743
AND WE HOPE TO HAVE INFORMATION

01:31:55.810 --> 01:31:57.478
THAT WE CAN SHARE WITH THE STATE

01:31:57.545 --> 01:31:59.513
IN THE NEXT FEW MONTHS. WE ARE

01:31:59.580 --> 01:32:01.048
RECRUITING PATIENTS AT THE TIME

01:32:01.115 --> 01:32:02.617
OF KOBE TESTING AND A UNIQUE

01:32:02.683 --> 01:32:04.886
FEATURE OF THE STUDY IS THAT WE

01:32:04.952 --> 01:32:07.021
HAVE WELCOME AND POSITIVE AND

01:32:07.088 --> 01:32:10.558
KOBE NEGATIVE INDIVIDUALS SO WE

01:32:10.625 --> 01:32:14.695
HAVE A CONTROL. I WAS ASKED. IN

01:32:14.762 --> 01:32:16.330
THINKING ABOUT WHAT YOU WANTED

01:32:16.397 --> 01:32:18.866
ME TO SAY TODAY I WAS ASKED TO

01:32:18.933 --> 01:32:21.002
TALK ABOUT. WHAT WE KNOW WHATWE

01:32:21.068 --> 01:32:22.937
DON'T KNOW AND WHAT MY

01:32:23.004 --> 01:32:25.172
SUGGESTIONS WOULD BE. SO TO

01:32:25.239 --> 01:32:29.477
START WITH WHAT WE KNOW. WE NOW

01:32:29.543 --> 01:32:32.079
NO LONGER EXISTS AND THIS IS A

01:32:32.146 --> 01:32:34.382
MONUMENTAL STEP FORWARD BECAUSE

01:32:34.448 --> 01:32:37.451
TRULY A YEAR AGO. PHYSICIANS AND

01:32:37.518 --> 01:32:39.220
SCIENTISTS DIDN'T BELIEVE IN

01:32:39.287 --> 01:32:41.389
SUCH AN ENTITY AND THIS IS

01:32:41.455 --> 01:32:44.792
IMPORTANT. AND THIS VALIDATES

01:32:44.859 --> 01:32:48.229
THE REALLY- HEARTFELT COMMENTS

01:32:48.296 --> 01:32:50.965
BY OUR THREE EARLIER SPEAKERS.

01:32:51.032 --> 01:32:53.834
THEN THE SECOND TOPIC IS WHAT WE

01:32:53.901 --> 01:32:55.836
DO NOT KNOW AND WHAT WE NEED TO

01:32:55.903 --> 01:32:57.738
STUDY- ALMOST EVERYTHING THERE

01:32:57.805 --> 01:32:59.774
IS BASICALLY. AN INFORMATION

01:32:59.840 --> 01:33:04.245
VOID WE DO NOT KNOW WHAT ARE THE

01:33:04.312 --> 01:33:06.447
MAIN FEATURES OF LONG CALLED IT

01:33:06.514 --> 01:33:08.783
WE DON'T KNOW HOW COMMON IT IS.

01:33:08.849 --> 01:33:10.484
I KNOW YOU WERE ASKING EARLIER

01:33:10.551 --> 01:33:13.387
SPEAKERS WHAT THEIR ESTIMATE IS

01:33:13.454 --> 01:33:15.256
WHAT PERCENTAGE IT MIGHT BE EVEN

01:33:15.323 --> 01:33:17.024
IF IT'S ONLY 5% OF PEOPLE THAT

01:33:17.091 --> 01:33:18.793
GET CODE HAVE LONG CALLED IT

01:33:18.859 --> 01:33:20.995
THAT IS AN ASTRONOMICALLY LARGE

01:33:21.062 --> 01:33:23.965
AND IMPACTFUL NUMBER- SO THE

01:33:24.031 --> 01:33:25.032
PERCENTAGES THAT ARE BEING

01:33:25.099 --> 01:33:29.036
REPORTED 510% TO FIFTY PERCENT-

01:33:29.103 --> 01:33:30.972
WE DON'T KNOW. WE DON'T KNOW IF

01:33:31.038 --> 01:33:32.840
IN THE FUTURE. TEN YEARS FROM

01:33:32.907 --> 01:33:36.110
NOW. WE MAY SEE LONG TERM

01:33:36.177 --> 01:33:39.213
EFFECTS FROM CODED THAT WE HAD

01:33:39.280 --> 01:33:40.781
EVEN ANTICIPATED THINK ABOUT

01:33:40.848 --> 01:33:42.950
SHINGLES BUT MANY OF US DEAL

01:33:43.017 --> 01:33:46.887
WITH DECADES AFTER- WE- WE DON'T

01:33:46.954 --> 01:33:49.457
KNOW HOW TO DIAGNOSE LUNG KOBE.

01:33:49.523 --> 01:33:51.726
NOW THIS MAY SEEM STRANGE TO

01:33:51.792 --> 01:33:54.395
SOME IN THE AUDIENCE WE HAVE A

01:33:54.462 --> 01:33:57.832
C. D. C. IN A W. H. O. CASE

01:33:57.898 --> 01:33:59.800
SURVEILLANCE CRITERIA AND THESE

01:33:59.867 --> 01:34:01.202
ARE USEFUL WHEN YOU'RE STUDYING

01:34:01.268 --> 01:34:03.337
THINGS OUT BEFORE WE KNEW WHAT

01:34:03.404 --> 01:34:05.773
CAUSED AIDS. AND WE HAD CASE

01:34:05.840 --> 01:34:08.242
CRITERIAS BEFORE WE KNEW HOW TO

01:34:08.309 --> 01:34:10.011
DIAGNOSE LEGIONNAIRES DISEASE OR

01:34:10.077 --> 01:34:11.245
LYME DISEASE WOULD HAVE CASE

01:34:11.312 --> 01:34:13.881
CRITERIAS. AND SURVEILLANCE THAT

01:34:13.948 --> 01:34:16.717
WE THEN WOULD STUDY BUT THAT IS

01:34:16.784 --> 01:34:18.085
THAT IS NOT THE SAME THING IS

01:34:18.152 --> 01:34:19.587
WHEN I'M A DOCTOR I'M SEEING

01:34:19.653 --> 01:34:21.188
PATIENTS IN CLINIC AND I WANT TO

01:34:21.255 --> 01:34:23.224
KNOW HOW DO I DIAGNOSE I DON'T

01:34:23.290 --> 01:34:25.426
HAVE A BLOOD TEST I DON'T HAVE

01:34:25.493 --> 01:34:28.729
AN X. RAY. THAT WILL

01:34:28.796 --> 01:34:29.563
DEFINITIVELY TELL ME THAT THIS

01:34:29.630 --> 01:34:31.132
IS DUE. TO THE EARLY KOBE

01:34:31.198 --> 01:34:33.034
DISEASE AND WE NEED WE NEED

01:34:33.100 --> 01:34:35.302
HELP- WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE

01:34:35.369 --> 01:34:37.204
RISK FACTORS ARE. FOR THE

01:34:37.271 --> 01:34:39.040
DEVELOPMENT OF LONG COATED. AND

01:34:39.106 --> 01:34:42.610
WE DON'T KNOW HOW TO TREAT.

01:34:42.676 --> 01:34:43.878
THERE'S BASICALLY THIS

01:34:43.944 --> 01:34:45.846
INFORMATION VOID IT'S KIND OF

01:34:45.913 --> 01:34:48.215
LIKE A PERFECT STORM PATIENTS

01:34:48.282 --> 01:34:50.384
AND THEIR FAMILIES ARE ANXIOUS

01:34:50.451 --> 01:34:51.719
AND SUFFERING THERE'S NOT

01:34:51.786 --> 01:34:53.454
ADEQUATE SUPPORT FOR HEALTH CARE

01:34:53.521 --> 01:34:55.589
PROVIDERS IN THE HEALTH SYSTEM

01:34:55.656 --> 01:34:56.724
WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE MORE

01:34:56.791 --> 01:34:58.592
PATIENTS WE DON'T HAVE CAPACITY

01:34:58.659 --> 01:35:00.094
AND WE NEED TO SUPPORT

01:35:00.161 --> 01:35:01.729
COLLECTION OF HIGHER QUALITY

01:35:01.796 --> 01:35:04.331
EVIDENCE. IN ADDITION TO BEING A

01:35:04.398 --> 01:35:05.366
PHYSICIAN AND SEEING PATIENTS IN

01:35:05.433 --> 01:35:07.068
CLINIC I'M ALSO AN

01:35:07.134 --> 01:35:09.036
EPIDEMIOLOGIST AND NOW THAT WE

01:35:09.103 --> 01:35:10.171
HAVE THE PANDEMIC PEOPLE HAVE

01:35:10.237 --> 01:35:12.106
HEARD OF THAT WORD AN

01:35:12.173 --> 01:35:13.040
EPIDEMIOLOGIST I BASICALLY LIKE

01:35:13.107 --> 01:35:16.944
TO STUDY HOW TO DIAGNOSE AND

01:35:17.011 --> 01:35:17.845
TREAT DISEASES AND HOW TO DO A

01:35:17.912 --> 01:35:21.248
BETTER JOB. AND I HAVE TO TELL

01:35:21.315 --> 01:35:24.218
YOU S. GENEALOGIST. THIRTY ONE

01:35:24.285 --> 01:35:27.888
KOBE IS NOT EASY THERE ARE SO

01:35:27.955 --> 01:35:30.491
MANY REASONS- IT IS UNIQUELY

01:35:30.558 --> 01:35:34.395
CHALLENGING- ONE REASON HAS TO

01:35:34.462 --> 01:35:36.363
DO WITH ALL THE WASTE IT HAS

01:35:36.430 --> 01:35:39.700
CHANGED OVER TIME. EARLY ON WE

01:35:39.767 --> 01:35:41.235
COULDN'T EVEN DIAGNOSED WE DID

01:35:41.302 --> 01:35:43.037
HAVE DIAGNOSTIC CAPABILITIES

01:35:43.104 --> 01:35:44.605
THEN THERE BEEN THESE NEW

01:35:44.672 --> 01:35:45.706
ADDITIONS OF DIFFERENT

01:35:45.773 --> 01:35:47.408
TREATMENTS THAT HAVE COME INTO

01:35:47.475 --> 01:35:49.877
PLAY WE DON'T KNOW HOW THOSE

01:35:49.944 --> 01:35:50.444
WILL AFFECT SUBSEQUENT LONG

01:35:50.511 --> 01:35:52.246
CORRECT. THEN WE HAVE NEW

01:35:52.313 --> 01:35:55.850
VACCINES NOW WE HAVE DIFFERENT

01:35:55.916 --> 01:35:57.551
VARIANTS AND SO WE NEED TO LEARN

01:35:57.618 --> 01:35:59.820
HOW THESE EVOLVING CHANGES OVER

01:35:59.887 --> 01:36:01.789
TIME WE'RE GOING TO IMPACT LONG

01:36:01.856 --> 01:36:05.126
KOBE. I WILL BE FOR THE AUDIENCE

01:36:05.192 --> 01:36:06.393
TO A PAPER THAT I PUBLISHED

01:36:06.460 --> 01:36:08.195
YESTERDAY ACTUALLY IN THE ANNALS

01:36:08.262 --> 01:36:09.897
OF INTERNAL MEDICINE IT'S ONLY

01:36:09.964 --> 01:36:11.832
IT'S SHORT ONLY TWO PAGES LONG

01:36:11.899 --> 01:36:13.634
AND IT DESCRIBES SOME OF THE

01:36:13.701 --> 01:36:15.736
CHALLENGES THAT SCIENTISTS ARE

01:36:15.803 --> 01:36:17.571
GONNA HAVE AND WE NEED TO PAY

01:36:17.638 --> 01:36:18.639
ATTENTION AND BE CAREFUL AND

01:36:18.706 --> 01:36:21.108
STUDIES. I AM WORRIED THAT SOME

01:36:21.175 --> 01:36:22.543
OF THE EARLY STUDIES HAVE BEEN

01:36:22.610 --> 01:36:25.579
LOW QUALITY AND I THINK WE NEED

01:36:25.646 --> 01:36:28.149
TO DO A BETTER JOB PATIENTS TO

01:36:28.215 --> 01:36:29.450
SURVIVE. AND IT HAS BEEN

01:36:29.517 --> 01:36:31.252
MENTIONED BY OTHERS DISPARITIES

01:36:31.318 --> 01:36:33.554
IN HEALTH AND HEALTH CARE. THE

01:36:33.621 --> 01:36:35.823
PANDEMIC IS MAKING IT WORSE AND

01:36:35.890 --> 01:36:39.460
I'M VERY CONCERNED AS A POSITION

01:36:39.527 --> 01:36:42.630
. AND AS A SCIENTIST- THE BURDEN

01:36:42.696 --> 01:36:45.032
OF THE PANDEMIC INCLUDING HIGHER

01:36:45.099 --> 01:36:46.433
INFECTION RATES AND HIGHER

01:36:46.500 --> 01:36:48.802
HOSPITALIZATION RATES IT HAS

01:36:48.869 --> 01:36:52.039
FALLEN DISPROPORTIONATELY ON

01:36:52.106 --> 01:36:53.908
INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE ALREADY

01:36:53.974 --> 01:36:55.109
VULNERABLE. TO INEQUITIES IN

01:36:55.176 --> 01:36:57.678
HEALTH AND HEALTH CARE YOU KNOW

01:36:57.745 --> 01:36:58.479
SO WE HAVE LONG KNOWN

01:36:58.546 --> 01:37:00.714
DISPARITIES AND I THINK THAT NEW

01:37:00.781 --> 01:37:02.216
INEQUITIES IN BOTH THE

01:37:02.283 --> 01:37:04.385
DEVELOPMENT THAT PRESENTATION

01:37:04.451 --> 01:37:06.387
AND DOCUMENTATION OF LONG

01:37:06.453 --> 01:37:09.290
CORBETT I THINK IT'S GONNA BE

01:37:09.356 --> 01:37:12.760
ECCENTRIC PROBLEMS- THE

01:37:12.826 --> 01:37:14.528
INVOLVING LONG KOBE CASE

01:37:14.595 --> 01:37:16.096
DEFINITION IT'S GOING TO BE

01:37:16.163 --> 01:37:18.232
INFLUENCED BY. PATIENTS THAT

01:37:18.299 --> 01:37:20.167
WE'RE SEEING IN CLINICS. NOT

01:37:20.234 --> 01:37:22.269
EVERYBODY CAN GET IN THE CLINICS

01:37:22.336 --> 01:37:24.538
IT'S GOING TO BE INFLUENCED BY

01:37:24.605 --> 01:37:26.340
HIS PARTICIPATING IN RESEARCH.

01:37:26.407 --> 01:37:28.442
AND BECAUSE MARGINALIZED GROUPS

01:37:28.509 --> 01:37:30.377
OFTEN RECEIVE LESS TIMELY

01:37:30.444 --> 01:37:32.046
DIAGNOSIS SO THEY OFTEN HAVE

01:37:32.112 --> 01:37:34.248
THEIR SYMPTOMS UNRECOGNIZED OR

01:37:34.315 --> 01:37:36.250
UNDOCUMENTED. I'M WORRIED THAT

01:37:36.317 --> 01:37:39.420
LONG CODE MAYBE UNDER DESCRIBED

01:37:39.486 --> 01:37:41.655
IN THOSE WHO ARE ALREADY

01:37:41.722 --> 01:37:44.725
VULNERABLE. I'LL CLOSE WITH

01:37:44.792 --> 01:37:47.294
THREE PRACTICAL SUGGESTIONS FOR

01:37:47.361 --> 01:37:49.530
OUR STATE FIRST IS REALLY. NOT

01:37:49.597 --> 01:37:51.765
SELF EVIDENT OUR BEST DEFENSE IN

01:37:51.832 --> 01:37:53.067
PREVENTING CODE IS WITH

01:37:53.133 --> 01:37:55.936
VACCINATIONS AND SO I ENCOURAGE

01:37:56.003 --> 01:37:57.671
US TO CONTINUE OUR REALLY

01:37:57.738 --> 01:38:00.808
IMPRESSIVE STATEWIDE EDUCATION

01:38:00.874 --> 01:38:03.377
AND OUTREACH EFFORTS. MY SECOND

01:38:03.444 --> 01:38:08.949
SUGGESTION IS- REALLY SIMPLE. WE

01:38:09.016 --> 01:38:13.153
NEED SMOKE DETECTORS. MILLIONS

01:38:13.220 --> 01:38:15.489
OF PEOPLE IN THE US CANNOT SMELL

01:38:15.556 --> 01:38:17.057
NOW BECAUSE THEY'VE HAD CALLED

01:38:17.124 --> 01:38:19.560
IT THIS IS WAS ONE OF THE FIRST

01:38:19.627 --> 01:38:22.429
LONG COALBED. YOU KNOW SYMPTOMS

01:38:22.496 --> 01:38:24.565
THAT BECAME APPARENT. YOU KNOW

01:38:24.632 --> 01:38:26.867
I'VE I'VE DIAGNOSED KOBE IN

01:38:26.934 --> 01:38:29.036
PATIENTS THAT. CALL ME UP

01:38:29.103 --> 01:38:30.971
BECAUSE THEY SAID THEY HAD A CUP

01:38:31.038 --> 01:38:32.373
OF COFFEE AND TEY COULDN'T

01:38:32.439 --> 01:38:33.841
SMELL THE CAFFEINE IN THE COFFEE

01:38:33.907 --> 01:38:35.175
AND THEY WONDERED WHY AND I SAID

01:38:35.242 --> 01:38:37.211
GO GET TESTED FOR COLD AND THEY

01:38:37.278 --> 01:38:39.580
HAD KOPEN. AND NOW A YEAR LATER

01:38:39.647 --> 01:38:40.281
THEY STILL CAN'T SMELL- IN

01:38:40.347 --> 01:38:42.283
ADDITION TO HAVING A REDUCED YOU

01:38:42.349 --> 01:38:44.118
KNOW QUALITY OF LIFE YOUR SENSE

01:38:44.184 --> 01:38:45.719
OF TASTE YOUR ENJOYMENT YOU

01:38:45.786 --> 01:38:48.455
CAN'T SMELL THE FLOWERS. YOU

01:38:48.522 --> 01:38:50.591
CAN'T SMELL FIRES AND SO A

01:38:50.658 --> 01:38:53.994
SIMPLE SUGGESTION IS- RAMPING UP

01:38:54.061 --> 01:38:55.696
OUR EDUCATIONAL EFFORTS-

01:38:55.763 --> 01:38:58.032
REGARDING SMOKE DETECTORS IT'S

01:38:58.098 --> 01:38:59.366
ESTIMATED THAT THERE ARE

01:38:59.433 --> 01:39:01.435
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE IN THE U. S.

01:39:01.502 --> 01:39:03.604
NOW THAT I HAVE REDUCED. SENSE

01:39:03.671 --> 01:39:06.140
OF SMELL THIS AND KNOWS ME UP.

01:39:06.206 --> 01:39:08.108
THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT 95% OF

01:39:08.175 --> 01:39:10.210
PEOPLE THAT HAVE IT ONLY LASTS

01:39:10.277 --> 01:39:12.246
FOR A FEW WEEKS TO MAYBE A FEW

01:39:12.313 --> 01:39:14.715
MONTHS. BUT IT'S NOT THE 225%

01:39:14.782 --> 01:39:17.117
HOW PERSISTENT AND WE DON'T KNOW

01:39:17.184 --> 01:39:18.352
HOW LONG BUT I HAVE SOME

01:39:18.419 --> 01:39:22.589
PATIENCE IT. IT'S DEFINITELY

01:39:22.656 --> 01:39:24.458
PERSISTENT FOR TWO YEARS. NOT MY

01:39:24.525 --> 01:39:25.693
FINAL SUGGESTION WILL BE.

01:39:25.759 --> 01:39:28.529
RESONATING WITH EARLIER COMMENTS

01:39:28.595 --> 01:39:30.664
IT HAS TO DO WITH THE CENTERS OF

01:39:30.731 --> 01:39:33.133
EXCELLENCE. FOR MANY YEARS I

01:39:33.200 --> 01:39:36.003
HAVE WORKED IN DOING RESEARCH IN

01:39:36.070 --> 01:39:37.971
CANCER AND HIV AND SEEING

01:39:38.038 --> 01:39:41.975
PATIENTS WITH CANCER AND HIV. IN

01:39:42.042 --> 01:39:44.178
THE U. S. WE PROVIDE OUTSTANDING

01:39:44.244 --> 01:39:46.613
QUALITY OF CARE AND WE HAVE

01:39:46.680 --> 01:39:48.315
AMAZING STRIDES AND

01:39:48.382 --> 01:39:50.317
ACCOMPLISHMENTS THAT WE'VE MADE

01:39:50.384 --> 01:39:52.286
IN RESEARCH ENDEAVORS. BUT

01:39:52.353 --> 01:39:54.922
THAT'S BECAUSE THESE ARE USUALLY

01:39:54.988 --> 01:39:57.991
DONE ON THE BACKBONE OF.

01:39:58.058 --> 01:40:00.094
COMPREHENSIVE CANCER CENTERS OR

01:40:00.160 --> 01:40:02.262
CENTERS OF EXCELLENCE FOR HIV

01:40:02.329 --> 01:40:07.101
CARE. WE WE'RE UNDERSTAFFED AND

01:40:07.167 --> 01:40:09.269
UNDER POWERED YOU KNOW I THINK A

01:40:09.336 --> 01:40:11.305
LOT OF THE LONG COLD MEDICATIONS

01:40:11.372 --> 01:40:12.172
THEY NEED TO GET FUNNELED INTO

01:40:12.239 --> 01:40:15.809
PRIMARY CARE TO START WITH AND

01:40:15.876 --> 01:40:17.111
THAT IS BECAUSE THERE'S SUCH A

01:40:17.177 --> 01:40:19.179
WIDE RANGE OF SYMPTOMS THAT ARE

01:40:19.246 --> 01:40:20.547
ASSOCIATED WITH LONG COAT AND

01:40:20.614 --> 01:40:22.416
THEN WE NEED CARE COORDINATORS

01:40:22.483 --> 01:40:24.184
AT THE CENTERS THAT CAN HELP YOU

01:40:24.251 --> 01:40:26.286
NAVIGATE THROUGH ALL OF THE MANY

01:40:26.353 --> 01:40:27.087
SOME SPECIALISTS FROM

01:40:27.154 --> 01:40:28.989
CARDIOLOGISTS TO A NEUROLOGIST

01:40:29.056 --> 01:40:30.457
WE DIDN'T NEED SUPPORT FOR

01:40:30.524 --> 01:40:31.325
PHYSICAL THERAPISTS

01:40:31.392 --> 01:40:33.427
REHABILITATION AT THEIR BEST

01:40:33.494 --> 01:40:35.262
THEN WE NEED SOCIAL WORKERS TO

01:40:35.329 --> 01:40:37.865
HELP THESE PEOPLE WITH THE

01:40:37.931 --> 01:40:38.966
QUALITY OF LIFE AND FINANCIAL

01:40:39.032 --> 01:40:39.800
ISSUES. I THINK THE UNIVERSITY

01:40:39.867 --> 01:40:42.436
OF CALIFORNIA HEALTH SYSTEM IS

01:40:42.503 --> 01:40:44.438
POISED TO TAKE ON SUCH A ROLE.

01:40:44.505 --> 01:40:46.974
THE UC SYSTEM IT'S REALLY A

01:40:47.040 --> 01:40:48.942
CROWN JEWEL IN OUR STATE IT'S

01:40:49.009 --> 01:40:51.378
LARGE IT'S MASSIVE. AND THE

01:40:51.445 --> 01:40:53.247
HEALTH SYSTEM IS ASSOCIATED WITH

01:40:53.313 --> 01:40:54.915
ACADEMIC POWERHOUSES FOR

01:40:54.982 --> 01:40:56.917
RESEARCH THE SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE

01:40:56.984 --> 01:40:58.952
IN THE SCHOOLS OF PUBLIC HEALTH-

01:40:59.019 --> 01:41:01.054
THIS. NETWORK IS UNLIKE ANY

01:41:01.121 --> 01:41:04.625
OTHER IN THE COUNTRY. SO I WOULD

01:41:04.691 --> 01:41:06.960
REALLY WANT TO SECOND OR THIRD

01:41:07.027 --> 01:41:09.596
THIS IDEA OF CENTERS OF

01:41:09.663 --> 01:41:12.299
EXCELLENCE. I SHOULD SAY THOUGH

01:41:12.366 --> 01:41:15.335
THAT- I HEARD SOME OF THE

01:41:15.402 --> 01:41:17.037
PATIENTS TALK ABOUT HOW THEY

01:41:17.104 --> 01:41:18.839
COULDN'T GET IN TO SEE ANYONE.

01:41:18.906 --> 01:41:20.707
THAT IS A REAL ISSUE NOW AND

01:41:20.774 --> 01:41:22.943
IT'S ONLY GONNA GET WORSE. MANY

01:41:23.010 --> 01:41:24.144
OF THE POSITIONS ARE

01:41:24.211 --> 01:41:26.547
VOLUNTEERING THEIR TIME TRYING

01:41:26.613 --> 01:41:29.316
TO HELP OUT AND SO- I REALLY

01:41:29.383 --> 01:41:30.918
THINK THAT GOING FORWARD ALL

01:41:30.984 --> 01:41:33.086
WORKING TOGETHER- I'M HOPING

01:41:33.153 --> 01:41:35.122
THAT WE CAN IMPROVE PRESS. I

01:41:35.189 --> 01:41:37.024
WANNA THANK EVERYONE FOR

01:41:37.090 --> 01:41:38.826
BRINGING THE TOPIC OF LONG CODED

01:41:38.892 --> 01:41:40.761
TO THE FOREFRONT WE HAVE A LONG

01:41:40.828 --> 01:41:42.863
HAUL AHEAD OF US AND I

MY SENSE OF TASTE OFFERED A

01:42:23.937 --> 01:42:25.072
COUPLE OF DAYS AND IT WAS IT

01:42:25.138 --> 01:42:26.373
IT'S HARD TO APPRECIATE WHAT

YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH IT JUST HOW.

01:42:28.675 --> 01:42:29.576
IMPACTFUL THAT IS IT WAS A

01:42:29.643 --> 01:42:31.111

BOTH OF YOU TO SPEAK A LITTLE

01:42:33.380 --> 01:42:35.148
BIT ABOUT THE MENTAL HEALTH

01:42:35.215 --> 01:42:36.416
DIMENSIONS. OF LONG COVE IN

01:42:36.483 --> 01:42:38.418
PARTICULAR AS WE AS WE THINK

ABOUT- THE YOU KNOW THE WAYS IN

01:42:40.220 --> 01:42:41.421
WHICH WE SHOULD INTEGRATE AND

01:42:41.488 --> 01:42:42.556
OORDINATE MENTAL HEALTH

01:42:42.623 --> 01:42:44.691
SERVICES IN ADDITION TO SOME OF

01:42:44.758 --> 01:42:46.393
THE- YOU KNOW THE OTHER

01:42:46.460 --> 01:42:48.662
PHYSICAL. NEEDS THAT HAVE BEEN

01:42:48.729 --> 01:42:51.231
ADDRESSED TODAY SHOULD BE

01:42:51.298 --> 01:42:52.966
INTEREST IN BOTH YOUR COMMENTS

01:42:53.033 --> 01:42:57.137
HERE. SURE I'LL START AND JUST

01:42:57.204 --> 01:42:59.373
SAY YOU KNOW ABSOLUTELY I THINK

01:42:59.439 --> 01:43:01.041
AND SOME OF THEM BECAUSE HERE'S

01:43:01.108 --> 01:43:02.476
HOW MULTI DISCIPLINARY. THIS IS

01:43:02.543 --> 01:43:04.444
GOING TO NEED TO BE NOT ONLY FOR

01:43:04.511 --> 01:43:06.013
THE HEALTH AND MENTAL HEALTH

01:43:06.079 --> 01:43:07.347
THAT BUT ALL THE OTHER IMPACTS

01:43:07.414 --> 01:43:09.383
AS WELL IS THAT THERE ARE A LOT

01:43:09.449 --> 01:43:10.484
OF EFFORTS TO IMPROVE OVERALL

01:43:10.551 --> 01:43:11.652
INTEGRATION OF MENTAL HEALTH

01:43:11.718 --> 01:43:14.087
AND- AND MEDICAL. HEALTH AND I

01:43:14.154 --> 01:43:15.956
THINK AS A STARTER HOME OR

01:43:16.023 --> 01:43:17.224
MENTION I THINK WE'RE JUST

01:43:17.291 --> 01:43:19.259
SCRATCHING THE SURFACE ON A LOT

01:43:19.326 --> 01:43:20.327
OF THE IMPACTS OF. LONG HOOD AND

01:43:20.394 --> 01:43:21.495
OTHER IMPACTS OF CODE IN

01:43:21.562 --> 01:43:23.697
GENERAL- SO. THINK AGAIN ARE

01:43:23.764 --> 01:43:24.464
INTENDED TO BE VERY MULTI

01:43:24.531 --> 01:43:26.733
DISCIPLINARY- ACROSS DIFFERENT

01:43:26.800 --> 01:43:28.502
HEALTH DISCIPLINES AS WELL AS-

01:43:28.569 --> 01:43:33.407
OTHER- SOCIAL SERVICES OTHER

01:43:33.473 --> 01:43:36.376
POLICY MAKERS AT CETERA. THE

01:43:36.443 --> 01:43:39.012
PANDEMIC ITSELF HAS LED TO AN

01:43:39.079 --> 01:43:40.347
INCREASE AND MENTAL HEALTH

01:43:40.414 --> 01:43:43.116
ISSUES CERTAINLY MADE A LOT OF

01:43:43.183 --> 01:43:46.486
PEOPLE DEPRESSED AND ANXIOUS- I

01:43:46.553 --> 01:43:49.389
THINK THAT THIS OBVIOUSLY WILL

01:43:49.456 --> 01:43:50.958
NEED TO BE A KEY COMPONENT OF

01:43:51.024 --> 01:43:54.361
THE CENTERS AND SUPPORT- VOICES

01:43:54.428 --> 01:43:56.029
OF THE PATIENTS NEED TO BE HEARD

01:43:56.096 --> 01:43:58.432
WITH COMPASSION AND THEY NEED

01:43:58.498 --> 01:44:00.467
ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND ACCESS

01:44:00.534 --> 01:44:02.302
TO CLINICAL TRIALS AND I THINK

01:44:02.369 --> 01:44:05.973
IF OF OUR COMMUNITY HEARS THAT

WE WANNA ALL WORK TOGETHER YOU

01:44:08.208 --> 01:44:10.510
KNOW WILL IT WILL BE BETTER IN

01:44:10.577 --> 01:44:11.545
THE END- IF YOU THINK ABOUT

01:44:11.612 --> 01:44:12.946
DEPRESSION WE ALSO HAVE A

01:44:13.013 --> 01:44:14.781
PROBLEM WITH THE HEALTH CARE

01:44:14.848 --> 01:44:16.883
WORKERS. YOU KNOW THEY'RE TIRED

01:44:16.950 --> 01:44:18.118
IT'S BEEN A LONG TWO YEARS FOR

01:44:18.185 --> 01:44:20.420
EVERYONE. I APPRECIATE THAT

01:44:20.487 --> 01:44:23.490
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK.

01:44:23.557 --> 01:44:27.194
EARLIER THANK YOU SENATOR PAN

01:44:27.260 --> 01:44:29.696
THANK YOU TO BOTH OF THE DOCTORS

01:44:29.763 --> 01:44:30.697
FOR THEIR EXPERTISE A DOCTOR

01:44:30.764 --> 01:44:32.299
ELMORE I HAD A QUESTION WHEN YOU

01:44:32.366 --> 01:44:34.334
TALK ABOUT THAT WE DON'T KNOW

01:44:34.401 --> 01:44:36.637
THE MAIN FEATURES OF LONG COVE

01:44:36.703 --> 01:44:38.405
IT HOW ARE WE GOING ABOUT

01:44:38.472 --> 01:44:40.607
FIGURING OUT WHAT THOSE ARE-

01:44:40.674 --> 01:44:42.209
THIS IS GOING TO SEEM OVERLY

01:44:42.275 --> 01:44:45.012
SIMPLISTIC I'M NOT A DOCTOR DO

01:44:45.078 --> 01:44:46.880
IS PEOPLE COME IN DO YOU ASK

01:44:46.947 --> 01:44:48.949
THEM DID YOU HAVE COVERED AND

01:44:49.016 --> 01:44:50.651
THEN MAYBE IT'S KIND OF LIKE A

01:44:50.717 --> 01:44:51.685
CHECKLIST OF WHAT THEY HAVE AND

01:44:51.752 --> 01:44:53.587
DON'T HAVE THE DO YOU CROSS

01:44:53.654 --> 01:44:55.656
REFERENCE THAT WITH WHAT OTHER

01:44:55.722 --> 01:44:57.624
FOLKS HAVE TO HOPEFULLY COME UP

01:44:57.691 --> 01:44:59.660
WITH SOME DATA. IN THE FUTURE

01:44:59.726 --> 01:45:02.295
THAT CAN HELP MORE EASILY

01:45:02.362 --> 01:45:06.767
DIAGNOSED LONG COVERED. THAT'S A

01:45:06.833 --> 01:45:11.805
GOOD QUESTION- I SUSPECT IN THE

01:45:11.872 --> 01:45:13.140
END THERE ARE GOING TO BE MANY

01:45:13.206 --> 01:45:16.576
DIFFERENT TYPES OF LONG COVE IT

01:45:16.643 --> 01:45:18.779
. SOME PATIENTS MAY ONLY HAVE A

01:45:18.845 --> 01:45:21.982
NOSE MIA THE INABILITY TO SMELL

01:45:22.049 --> 01:45:24.017
BUT THAT IS VERY IMPACTFUL.

01:45:24.084 --> 01:45:26.053
OTHERS MAY JUST HAVE NEUROLOGIC

01:45:26.119 --> 01:45:28.221
SOME MAY HAVE CARDIAC SOMEBODY

01:45:28.288 --> 01:45:32.159
JUST TEMPERAMENTAL LOGIC. AND IN

01:45:32.225 --> 01:45:34.428
THE STUDIES FOR EXAMPLE IN THE

01:45:34.494 --> 01:45:36.063
INSPIRE STUDY WE ARE HAVING

01:45:36.129 --> 01:45:38.331
PATIENTS FILL OUT SURVEYS REALLY

01:45:38.398 --> 01:45:40.701
LONG LIST OF SYMPTOMS AND THEY

01:45:40.767 --> 01:45:42.002
CHECK OFF WAT SYMPTOMS THEY

01:45:42.069 --> 01:45:43.870
HAVE AND THEN WE'RE FOLLOWING

01:45:43.937 --> 01:45:46.006
THEM FORWARD EVERY THREE MONTHS

01:45:46.073 --> 01:45:47.708
TO FIND OUT ARE THOSE SYMPTOMS

01:45:47.774 --> 01:45:49.476
STILL PRESENT ARE THEY GOING

01:45:49.543 --> 01:45:51.011
AWAY FOR THE DEVELOPING NEW

01:45:51.078 --> 01:45:54.181
SYMPTOMS AND WHEN YOU ARE ABLE

01:45:54.247 --> 01:45:56.850
AND HAVE THOUSANDS OF PATIENTS

01:45:56.917 --> 01:45:58.785
PARTICIPATING IN HELPING YOU IN

01:45:58.852 --> 01:46:01.421
THIS STUDY. YOU THEN CAN COMPARE

01:46:01.488 --> 01:46:03.724
THE RATE OF SYMPTOMS IN THOSE

01:46:03.790 --> 01:46:06.093
THAT HAD COAL BED TO THE RATE

01:46:06.159 --> 01:46:07.394
AND THOSE THAT WERE COMMON

01:46:07.461 --> 01:46:08.929
NEGATIVE WE'RE RECRUITING

01:46:08.995 --> 01:46:11.198
PATIENTS AT THE TIME WHERE THERE

01:46:11.264 --> 01:46:12.265
THEY THINK THEY'RE SYMPTOMATIC

01:46:12.332 --> 01:46:13.800
WITH AN ACUTE CO INFECTION YOU

01:46:13.867 --> 01:46:15.669
KNOW THERE THEY'VE GOT A FEVER A

01:46:15.736 --> 01:46:18.138
COUGH DON'T FEEL WELL- AND THEN

01:46:18.205 --> 01:46:19.773
WE TAKE THEM REGARDLESS OF

01:46:19.840 --> 01:46:20.807
WHETHER THE COMMON POSITIVE OR

01:46:20.874 --> 01:46:22.309
NEGATIVE AND SO THIS WAY YOU

01:46:22.375 --> 01:46:23.844
HAVE CONTROLS AND THERE'S A

01:46:23.910 --> 01:46:26.980
CERTAIN LOW RATE BACKGROUND A

01:46:27.047 --> 01:46:28.281
SMALL NUMBER OF PEOPLE HAVE

01:46:28.348 --> 01:46:30.050
HEADACHES EXCEPT HER BUT WHEN

01:46:30.117 --> 01:46:32.285
YOU CAN COMPARE THE RATE. GOING

01:46:32.352 --> 01:46:37.157
FORWARD OVER MONTHS TO A. YEAR

01:46:37.224 --> 01:46:38.258
OR TWO. AND YOU SEE. FIVE

01:46:38.325 --> 01:46:40.026
SYMPTOM POP OUT AS BEING

01:46:40.093 --> 01:46:40.794
STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT AND

01:46:40.861 --> 01:46:42.429
MUCH MORE COMMON IN PEOPLE THAT

01:46:42.496 --> 01:46:44.464
HAD KOBE. THAT'S HOW YOU GET THE

01:46:44.531 --> 01:46:46.133
ANSWER. BUT YOU'RE RIGHT IT'S

01:46:46.199 --> 01:46:47.534
VERY CONFUSING- AND

01:46:47.601 --> 01:46:49.336
SCIENTIFICALLY IT'S A MESS ALL

01:46:49.402 --> 01:46:50.437
OF THE PUBLICATIONS ARE USING

01:46:50.504 --> 01:46:53.173
DIFFERENT DEFINITIONS- AND SO

01:46:53.240 --> 01:46:54.775
IT'S HARD TO COMPARE IT'S LIKE

01:46:54.841 --> 01:46:56.009
YOU'RE COMPARING APPLES TO

01:46:56.076 --> 01:46:58.178
ORANGES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

01:46:58.245 --> 01:47:01.882
THANK YOU SIR RUBIO. THANK YOU

01:47:01.948 --> 01:47:04.151

COLLEAGUE THAT JUST HAS TO

01:47:07.387 --> 01:47:08.355
QUESTION IT JUST SEEMS THAT THE

01:47:08.421 --> 01:47:10.090
INFORMATION IS ALL OVER THE

01:47:10.157 --> 01:47:11.625
PLACE AND I RIGHTFULLY SO THIS

01:47:11.691 --> 01:47:13.160
IS SOMETHING NEW AND EVERYONE'S

01:47:13.226 --> 01:47:14.494
DEALING WITH DIFFERENT THINGS

01:47:14.561 --> 01:47:15.729
BUT JUST BASED ON THE STORIES

01:47:15.796 --> 01:47:18.031

01:47:24.204 --> 01:47:26.006
PARTICULAR THE INS FIRE STUDY

01:47:26.072 --> 01:47:27.808

01:47:38.018 --> 01:47:39.519
CENTRALIZED PLACE. WHERE ALL

01:47:39.586 --> 01:47:40.821

DEFINITION OR NOT. THERE'S BEEN

01:48:48.555 --> 01:48:50.323
A LOT OF DISCUSSION TODAY ABOUT

01:48:50.390 --> 01:48:50.991
THE CHALLENGES OF THAT BUT- IF

01:48:51.057 --> 01:48:52.692
WE DO DO THAT EITHER NATIONALLY

01:48:52.759 --> 01:48:54.494
OR OR AT THE STATE LEVEL WE CAN.

01:48:54.561 --> 01:48:56.296
WORK TO COLLECT THAT DATA- MORE

01:48:56.363 --> 01:48:57.797
COMPREHENSIVELY AT A MINIMUM

01:48:57.864 --> 01:48:59.232

THAT HAS- CASES AND CONTACTS AND

01:49:10.744 --> 01:49:12.178
ACTUALLY THERE ARE WAYS TO KIND

01:49:12.245 --> 01:49:14.147
OF SEND AUTOMATED SERVICE. ABOUT

01:49:14.214 --> 01:49:15.615
POST CODE SYMPTOMS SO THAT IS

01:49:15.682 --> 01:49:16.917
SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN

UTILIZATION OF IT BUT IT'S

01:49:20.253 --> 01:49:21.187
ANOTHER WAY WE CAN TRY TO HAVE

01:49:21.254 --> 01:49:22.822
MORE CONSISTENT DATA COLLECTION

01:49:22.889 --> 01:49:24.424

AT LEAST WHAT WE THINK IS THE

01:49:59.826 --> 01:50:01.194
BEST PRACTICE- WITH THIS VOID OF

01:50:01.261 --> 01:50:03.630

EARLY IDEAS FOR TREATMENT

01:50:25.618 --> 01:50:27.354

THE EXPERTS ARE SAYING WHAT'S

01:51:31.184 --> 01:51:32.318
STILL A MASS FOR THE DEFINITION

01:51:32.385 --> 01:51:34.020
IS AND THEN MEANTIME WE'RE

01:51:34.087 --> 01:51:35.722
EXPECTED TO FILL OUT PAPERWORK

01:51:35.789 --> 01:51:37.557

A CHAIR POSITIONS TO BE ABLE TO

01:51:51.704 --> 01:51:53.706

01:51:53.773 --> 01:51:54.874
ACCESS TO MULTI DISPLAY TEAM ALL

01:51:54.941 --> 01:51:56.076
RIGHT THEY CAN TRY TO PUT ONE

01:51:56.142 --> 01:51:57.744
TOGETHER THROUGH REFERRALS BUT-

01:51:57.811 --> 01:51:58.812
WHICH I NEED TO GIVEN THE

01:51:58.878 --> 01:51:59.946
NUMBERS THAT'S HAPPENING WITH

SOMETHING MORE SYSTEMATIC. SO

01:52:01.881 --> 01:52:03.450
THAT THE PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS

01:52:03.516 --> 01:52:04.918

BUT OFTEN TIMES THE BURDEN OF

01:52:12.692 --> 01:52:14.961
QUOTE UNQUOTE CERTIFYING SUPPORT

01:52:15.028 --> 01:52:16.963
FALLS ON HIS PRIMARY CARE

01:52:17.030 --> 01:52:17.630
PHYSICIANS WHO- YOU KNOW WHAT TO

01:52:17.697 --> 01:52:19.299

01:52:19.365 --> 01:52:22.202
TIME. THEY FEEL LIKE THAT NO I

01:52:22.268 --> 01:52:23.536
CAN'T DO THE WHOLE VALUATION

01:52:23.603 --> 01:52:24.504
MYSELF AND ESPECIALLY IF THE

01:52:24.571 --> 01:52:26.206

RIGHT- SO. MAYBE I GUESS THE

01:52:33.413 --> 01:52:35.014
QUESTION IS THAT OUR SUGGESTION

01:52:35.081 --> 01:52:37.050

THAT'S ONLY THE TIP OF THE

01:56:18.805 --> 01:56:20.406
ICEBERG WE ALSO SEE A FAIR

01:57:17.430 --> 01:57:19.866
OF HOUSEHOLD CHORES. WERE GOING

01:57:19.932 --> 01:57:24.203
TO WORK. NOW 63% OF THE PATIENTS

01:57:24.270 --> 01:57:26.172
THAT WE HAVE SEEN OUR CLINIC HAD

01:57:26.239 --> 01:57:28.174
BEEN ABLE TO GET BACK TO WORK BY

01:57:28.241 --> 01:57:29.876
THE TIME THEY STARTED HERE WITH

01:57:29.942 --> 01:57:31.477
US. AND THAT SOUNDS PROMISING

01:57:31.544 --> 01:57:33.679
BUT IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT

01:57:33.746 --> 01:57:35.214
AT THE TIME THAT WE DID THE

01:57:35.281 --> 01:57:36.282
SURVEYING THE AVERAGE TIME

01:57:36.349 --> 01:57:38.117
BETWEEN THE INFECTION AND

01:57:38.184 --> 01:57:40.720
PRESENTATION WITH OUR CLINIC WAS

01:57:40.787 --> 01:57:42.488
THREE MONTHS. SO ANOTHER WAY TO

01:57:42.555 --> 01:57:44.424
LOOK AT THIS IS THAT AFTER THREE

01:57:44.490 --> 01:57:46.225
MONTHS FROM INFECTIONS START

01:57:46.292 --> 01:57:47.927
ONLY A LITTLE BIT MORE THAN HALF

01:57:47.994 --> 01:57:50.663
OF PATIENTS ARE GETTING BACK TO

01:57:50.730 --> 01:57:52.131
THEIR LIVELIHOOD. ON TOP OF THAT

01:57:52.198 --> 01:57:53.800
OF THOSE PATIENTS THAT ARE BACK

01:57:53.866 --> 01:57:55.201
MANY OF THEM WERE WORKING

01:57:55.268 --> 01:57:58.571
REDUCED HOURS OR HAD OTHER KINDS

01:57:58.638 --> 01:58:00.973
OF WORK RESTRICTIONS. AGAIN THIS

01:58:01.040 --> 01:58:02.241
IS WHAT WE HAVE SEEN HERE IN OUR

01:58:02.308 --> 01:58:04.076
OWN CLINIC BUT THIS IS ALSO

01:58:04.143 --> 01:58:05.211
CONSISTENT WITH WHAT'S BEEN

01:58:05.278 --> 01:58:06.612
FOUND AT OTHER CLINICS ACROSS

01:58:06.679 --> 01:58:08.214
THE UNITED STATES AND ACROSS THE

01:58:08.281 --> 01:58:09.549
WORLD. SO FOR EXAMPLE IN MOUNT

01:58:09.615 --> 01:58:11.884
SINAI AND WHICH IS ONE OF THE

01:58:11.951 --> 01:58:13.019
FIRST LOCALLY CLINICS IN THE

01:58:13.085 --> 01:58:15.588
COUNTRY- THIS IS A DIAGRAM THAT

01:58:15.655 --> 01:58:16.355
COMES IN THEIR PATIENT

01:58:16.422 --> 01:58:18.057
POPULATION WHICH YOU CAN SEE IN

01:58:18.124 --> 01:58:20.493
THE DARK BARS ARE- EMPLOYMENT

01:58:20.560 --> 01:58:22.995
STATUS BEFORE COATED. IN A LIGHT

01:58:23.062 --> 01:58:25.031
GRAY BARS AFTER. IN WHICH YOU

01:58:25.097 --> 01:58:27.166
CAN SEE IS OF COURSE THE FULL

01:58:27.233 --> 01:58:28.501
TIME WORK IS DECREASING AS TIME

01:58:28.568 --> 01:58:31.137
GOES ON PART TIME WORK GOES UP.

01:58:31.204 --> 01:58:35.508
RESUME PLAYMATE GO UP AND THOSE

01:58:35.575 --> 01:58:37.844
WHO ARE RETIRED GOAL OF. AND AS

01:58:37.910 --> 01:58:38.678
FOR THE LONGEVITY OF THESE KINDS

01:58:38.744 --> 01:58:40.112
OF FUNCTIONAL LIMITATIONS THERE

01:58:40.179 --> 01:58:42.114
IS NOT GOOD NEWS. AS MENTIONED

01:58:42.181 --> 01:58:43.783
EARLIER WE'RE ALMOST NOW TWO

01:58:43.850 --> 01:58:46.018
YEARS ALICE INTO TRYING TO

01:58:46.085 --> 01:58:47.553
MANAGE THIS CONDITION AND WE DO

01:58:47.620 --> 01:58:49.355
HAVE THE INFORMATION NOW ABOUT

01:58:49.422 --> 01:58:51.357
HOW PATIENTS ARE DOING. OVER THE

01:58:51.424 --> 01:58:53.125
LONG TERM BIKE THE STUDY THAT

01:58:53.192 --> 01:58:55.228
CAME OUT OF NEW YORK. LOOKING AT

01:58:55.294 --> 01:58:57.296
HOW FIVE HUNDRED AND THIRTY

01:58:57.363 --> 01:58:58.264
PATIENTS WERE DOING TWELVE

01:58:58.331 --> 01:58:59.999
MONTHS AFTER THEY WERE

01:59:00.066 --> 01:59:01.834
DISCHARGED FROM THE HOSPITAL.

01:59:01.901 --> 01:59:03.669
AND WHAT WE SEE FROM THAT SURVEY

01:59:03.736 --> 01:59:06.539
IS THAT 41% OF PATIENTS REPORTED

01:59:06.606 --> 01:59:08.808
WORSE HEALTH STILL THAN THEIR

01:59:08.875 --> 01:59:10.877
BASELINE BEFORE CALLED IT. 45%

01:59:10.943 --> 01:59:13.980
ALMOST HAVE PERSISTENT SYMPTOMS

01:59:14.046 --> 01:59:15.314
MORE ALARMING THEIR FUNCTION WAS

01:59:15.381 --> 01:59:17.984
ALSO LIMITED 36% REPORTED

01:59:18.050 --> 01:59:19.318
DIFFICULTIES WITH CARRYING THEIR

01:59:19.385 --> 01:59:21.254
GROCERIES ALMOST 40% HAD

01:59:21.320 --> 01:59:23.389
TROUBLES WALKING UP A FLIGHT OF

01:59:23.456 --> 01:59:25.224
STAIRS. SO THE FUNCTIONAL

01:59:25.291 --> 01:59:27.960
DEFICITS THEY CAN STICK AROUND

01:59:28.027 --> 01:59:30.229
FOR QUITE A LONG TIME. A

01:59:30.296 --> 01:59:32.365
QUESTION I'M OFTEN ASKED WHEN

01:59:32.431 --> 01:59:33.766
THIS INFORMATION IS PRESENTED AS

01:59:33.833 --> 01:59:36.469
WHY ARE PATIENTS WITH LONG COAT

01:59:36.536 --> 01:59:38.871
WOULD LOSING THEIR JOBS. MOST

01:59:38.938 --> 01:59:40.373
WOULD THINK THAT THE ANSWER IS

01:59:40.439 --> 01:59:42.708
PRIMARILY TIME AGENTS ARE JUST

01:59:42.775 --> 01:59:44.744
NOT GETTING BETTER FAST ENOUGH.

01:59:44.810 --> 01:59:46.078
HOWEVER IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE

01:59:46.145 --> 01:59:47.914
THAT GETTING SOMEONE BACK TO

01:59:47.980 --> 01:59:50.583
WORK EVOLVES MORE THAN JUST

01:59:50.650 --> 01:59:52.485
MAKING SOMEONE FEEL BETTER.

01:59:52.552 --> 01:59:54.220
THERE ARE MULTIPLE FACTORS AT

01:59:54.287 --> 01:59:55.922
PLAY WHEN IT COMES TO THE

01:59:55.988 --> 01:59:57.256
INTERACTION BETWEEN WORK AND

01:59:57.323 --> 02:00:01.494
HEALTH NEEDS WHY I HAVE A JOB IN

02:00:01.561 --> 02:00:03.029
HIS CAREER. FOR EXAMPLE MANY

02:00:03.095 --> 02:00:03.729
EMPLOYERS ARE VERY CONFUSED

02:00:03.796 --> 02:00:05.598
ABOUT WHAT THEY CAN DO TO HELP

02:00:05.665 --> 02:00:07.900
EMPLOYEES. WITH LONG HAUL CODE

02:00:07.967 --> 02:00:09.201
WOULD COME BACK TO WORK

02:00:09.268 --> 02:00:12.038
SUCCESSFULLY. THE USUAL RESPONSE

02:00:12.104 --> 02:00:13.272
BY EMPLOYER GROUPS WHEN

02:00:13.339 --> 02:00:15.141
CHALLENGED WITH THIS CONDITION.

02:00:15.207 --> 02:00:17.109
WELL PLEASE DON'T COME BACK

02:00:17.176 --> 02:00:19.278
UNTIL YOU ARE 1100% BETTER. WHAT

02:00:19.345 --> 02:00:20.980
I DON'T KNOW IF ANY OF US START

02:00:21.047 --> 02:00:22.615
THE DAY WITH 1100% OF FEELING

02:00:22.682 --> 02:00:24.216
WELL WHEN IT COMES TO OUR WORK

02:00:24.283 --> 02:00:25.618
SO THIS IS A VERY DIFFICULT

02:00:25.685 --> 02:00:27.887
CHALLENGE FOR MANY EMPLOYEES. SO

02:00:27.954 --> 02:00:29.589
THE POINT I REALIZE AGAIN THAT

02:00:29.655 --> 02:00:30.957
THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS THAT

02:00:31.023 --> 02:00:32.658
ARE LEFT TO BE ADDRESSED IN

02:00:32.725 --> 02:00:34.794
ADDITION TO MEDICAL CARE. TO

02:00:34.860 --> 02:00:37.263
HELP PEOPLE GET BACK TO THEIR

02:00:37.330 --> 02:00:39.565
LIVELIHOODS. IN THE MEANTIME

02:00:39.632 --> 02:00:42.068
WITH THIS KIND OF DATA AND BASED

02:00:42.134 --> 02:00:43.269
ON WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN THE

02:00:43.336 --> 02:00:45.404
CLINICS. I AM WORRIED THAT WE'RE

02:00:45.471 --> 02:00:47.540
GONNA BE FACING A TIDAL WAVE OF

02:00:47.607 --> 02:00:48.975
PATIENTS UNABLE TO RETURN TO

02:00:49.041 --> 02:00:50.843
WORK FOR A PROLONGED PERIOD OF

02:00:50.910 --> 02:00:52.979
TIME DUE TO LONG COATED. AND I

02:00:53.045 --> 02:00:55.014
REALLY FEAR WHAT THIS MAY DO TO

02:00:55.081 --> 02:00:57.316
OUR WORLD AS WE KNOW IT. WE DID

02:00:57.383 --> 02:00:59.752
HAVE A PREVIEW OF WHAT COULD

02:00:59.819 --> 02:01:00.486
HAPPEN DURING THIS LAST HOLIDAY

02:01:00.553 --> 02:01:02.888
SEASON. MANY OF YOU REMEMBER

02:01:02.955 --> 02:01:04.590
THAT THERE WERE THOUSANDS OF

02:01:04.657 --> 02:01:06.192
HOLIDAY FLIGHTS YOU MAY CANCEL

02:01:06.258 --> 02:01:08.060
AT THE WORST TIME. DUE TO

02:01:08.127 --> 02:01:10.096
PATIENTS- HE'S MADE DUE TO

02:01:10.162 --> 02:01:12.665
FLIGHT CREWS. AND PILOTS BEING

02:01:12.732 --> 02:01:14.667
OUT OF WORK DUE TO OVERCROWDING.

02:01:14.734 --> 02:01:16.636
WE ALSO HEARD STORIES OF. FIRE

02:01:16.702 --> 02:01:18.404
DEPARTMENTS IN CINCINNATI HAVING

02:01:18.471 --> 02:01:20.539
TO WORK OVERTIME BECAUSE OF THE

02:01:20.606 --> 02:01:22.475
STAFF SHORTAGE. SO THERE IS A

02:01:22.541 --> 02:01:24.543
POTENTIAL IMPACT ON OUR WORLD

02:01:24.610 --> 02:01:26.879
OUR SOCIETY OR ECONOMY. DUE TO

02:01:26.946 --> 02:01:30.182
THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO ARE

02:01:30.249 --> 02:01:31.317
SUFFERING FROM LONG COATED. OF

02:01:31.384 --> 02:01:33.386
COURSE THE WORKFORCE ISSUES ONLY

02:01:33.452 --> 02:01:34.220
ONE OF MANY CHALLENGES AND THEY

02:01:34.286 --> 02:01:36.188
MY COLLEAGUES THEY HAD MENTIONED

02:01:36.255 --> 02:01:37.623
SOME OF THESE ALREADY SOLVED

02:01:37.690 --> 02:01:38.391
JUST IN BRIEF. ONE THING THAT I

02:01:38.457 --> 02:01:40.459
DO WORRY ABOUT VERY MUCH SO IS

02:01:40.526 --> 02:01:42.061
THAT WE ARE NOT SEEING ALL

02:01:42.128 --> 02:01:43.029
PATIENT POPULATIONS. REPRESENTED

02:01:43.095 --> 02:01:44.363
IN THIS GROUP INCLUDING

02:01:44.430 --> 02:01:46.332
INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE COMING FROM

02:01:46.399 --> 02:01:48.367
OTHER KINDS OF JOBS LIKE. MORE

02:01:48.434 --> 02:01:50.403
LABOR INDUSTRIES AND SO FORTH.

02:01:50.469 --> 02:01:52.672
WE ALSO DON'T HAVE A GOOD WAY OF

02:01:52.738 --> 02:01:53.406
ASSESSING IMPACTS ACROSS THE

02:01:53.472 --> 02:01:55.307
NATION OR A STATE WIDE FASHION.

02:01:55.374 --> 02:01:56.842
WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH PROVIDERS

02:01:56.909 --> 02:01:58.177
TO HELP MANAGE THIS CONDITION

02:01:58.244 --> 02:02:01.547
AND PROBABLY MOST ALARMING. THIS

02:02:01.614 --> 02:02:04.583
IS NOT RARE. TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA

02:02:04.650 --> 02:02:06.585
OF THE KIND OF. PROBLEM THAT WE

02:02:06.652 --> 02:02:08.521
HAVE AHEAD OF US WITH THIS

02:02:08.587 --> 02:02:11.057
CURRENTLY AS OF THIS WEEK- BEEN

02:02:11.123 --> 02:02:13.359
SEVENTY NINE MILLION COVER

02:02:13.426 --> 02:02:14.493
NINETEEN CASES IN THE UNITED

02:02:14.560 --> 02:02:16.028
STATES ALONE. HERE THE MAYO

02:02:16.095 --> 02:02:17.430
CLINIC JUST LIKE OUR FIRST

02:02:17.496 --> 02:02:19.331
PRESENTER WE ESTIMATE

02:02:19.398 --> 02:02:21.033
CONSERVATIVELY BASED ON THE

02:02:21.100 --> 02:02:22.735
RESEARCH CONSERVATIVELY ESTIMATE

02:02:22.802 --> 02:02:24.770
THAT TEN TO TWENTY PERCENT. OF

02:02:24.837 --> 02:02:26.605
INDIVIDUALS WITH COVER NINETEEN

02:02:26.672 --> 02:02:28.808
ARE GOING TO COME DOWN WITH LONG

02:02:28.874 --> 02:02:30.710
ALL COOL. SO THAT'S SEVEN POINT

02:02:30.776 --> 02:02:33.012
NINE MILLION PEOPLE. BASED ON

02:02:33.079 --> 02:02:34.380
OUR CLINIC EXPERIENCE AS WELL AS

02:02:34.447 --> 02:02:35.548
RESEARCH IS OUT THERE WE

02:02:35.614 --> 02:02:37.516
ANTICIPATE THAT 30% OF THOSE

02:02:37.583 --> 02:02:39.552
INDIVIDUALS WILL HAVE LONG TERM

02:02:39.618 --> 02:02:41.153
DIFFICULTIES GETTING BACK TO

02:02:41.220 --> 02:02:43.155
THEIR NORMAL WORK. AND THAT IS

02:02:43.222 --> 02:02:45.224
ROUGHLY TWO POINT THREE SEVEN

02:02:45.291 --> 02:02:47.927
MILLION PEOPLE OUT OF WORK DUE

02:02:47.993 --> 02:02:49.261
TO LOW HOW COOL IT FOR MANY

02:02:49.328 --> 02:02:51.430
MONTHS OR INDEFINITELY. SO THE

02:02:51.497 --> 02:02:53.566
CHALLENGE AHEAD OF US WITH LOCAL

02:02:53.632 --> 02:02:55.034
WHICH IS MORE THAN JUST A HEALTH

02:02:55.101 --> 02:02:56.402
CARE CHALLENGES A CHALLENGE FOR

02:02:56.469 --> 02:02:59.038
OUR SOCIETY. IN OUR ECONOMY AS A

02:02:59.105 --> 02:03:02.641
WHOLE. WITH THAT I WILL PAUSE

02:03:02.708 --> 02:03:05.411
AND- NEIL TO OUR NEXT PRESENTER.

02:03:05.478 --> 02:03:06.579

IT'S A TOPIC THAT I'VE BEEN

02:03:15.955 --> 02:03:18.057
RESEARCHING BIRTH FOR THERE IS

02:03:18.124 --> 02:03:19.959
EVEN A NAME TO PUT TO THE

TODAY IT'S IMPORTANT TO

02:03:22.394 --> 02:03:23.596
UNDERSTAND THAT NOT EVERYONE HAS

02:03:23.662 --> 02:03:25.698
THE PRIVILEGE OR THE OPPORTUNITY

02:03:25.765 --> 02:03:27.566
TO BE ABLE TO RETURN TO LIFE AS

02:03:27.633 --> 02:03:29.101

02:10:02.528 --> 02:10:04.229
OUT HALF FOR A LITTLE OVER HALF.

02:10:04.296 --> 02:10:08.167
OVER HALF OF AMERICANS HAVEN'T.

02:10:08.233 --> 02:10:10.002
HAD BECAUSE OF IT- THIS LOOKING

02:10:10.068 --> 02:10:11.603
AT THE NUMBERS OF LONG COVE IN

02:10:11.670 --> 02:10:13.739
AND THAT YOU KNOW WHAT WE HAVE A

02:10:13.805 --> 02:10:14.606
RANGE OF FREQUENCIES AND SO

02:10:14.673 --> 02:10:16.408
FORTH. WHAT YOU EAT IMAGE SHOULD

02:10:16.475 --> 02:10:17.876
WE BE WORKING HARDER THIS STOP

02:10:17.943 --> 02:10:19.211
TO PREVENT THE OTHER HALF FROM

02:10:19.278 --> 02:10:20.212
ACTUALLY ARE LITTLE OVER HALF

02:10:20.279 --> 02:10:21.647
FROM GETTING COLD IN THE FIRST

02:10:21.713 --> 02:10:23.882
PLACE I MEAN WE WE'VE BEEN

02:10:23.949 --> 02:10:24.750
TALKING ABOUT. ALL THE SERVICES-

02:10:24.816 --> 02:10:26.185
FOR THEM WE NEED TO DO THAT

02:10:26.251 --> 02:10:27.352
THERE'S SO MANY PEOPLE RAVE

02:10:27.419 --> 02:10:29.254
GOTTEN COBIT OR A HALF BLOCK OF

02:10:29.321 --> 02:10:31.089
IT. WHAT YOU'LL BE DOING TO. IT

02:10:31.156 --> 02:10:32.257
YOU KNOW SOME PEOPLE SAID WELL

02:10:32.324 --> 02:10:34.026
HEY YOU KNOW WHAT'S IT'S OKAY

02:10:34.092 --> 02:10:36.828
PEOPLE CAN GET KIND OF IT AND- I

02:10:36.895 --> 02:10:38.130
WILL DEAL WITH IT LATER- BUT-

02:10:38.197 --> 02:10:39.131
WHAT YOU'RE TELLING ME IN TERMS

02:10:39.198 --> 02:10:40.365
OF THE BURDEN. SHOULD WE BE

02:10:40.432 --> 02:10:42.234
WORKING HARDER TO TRY TO PREVENT

02:10:42.301 --> 02:10:45.904
THE CODED SO THAT WE DON'T KEEP

02:10:45.971 --> 02:10:47.039
ADDING TO THIS BURDEN OF LONG

02:10:47.105 --> 02:10:48.874
KERR. COVE IN. YES GREAT

02:10:48.941 --> 02:10:50.442
QUESTION THANK YOU FOR THAT AND

02:10:50.509 --> 02:10:51.977
I THINK THERE'S THREE MAIN.

02:10:52.044 --> 02:10:53.245
POINTS THERE THAT I COULD JUST

02:10:53.312 --> 02:10:55.247
TOUCH ON BRIEFLY FIRST YES THE

02:10:55.314 --> 02:10:57.049
NUMBERS THAT WE HAVE. FOR THESE

02:10:57.115 --> 02:10:58.350
ESTIMATES THEIR ESTIMATES DOES

02:10:58.417 --> 02:11:00.619
THAT. AND THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE

02:11:00.686 --> 02:11:03.255
OUT THERE WHO MAY HAVE HAD KOBE.

02:11:03.322 --> 02:11:04.556
WHO DEMAND ACCESS OF TESTING

02:11:04.623 --> 02:11:05.991
ESPECIALLY EARLY ON THE

02:11:06.058 --> 02:11:07.292
PANDEMIC. YOU MAY BE

02:11:07.359 --> 02:11:08.894
EXPERIENCING THE SYMPTOMS AND

02:11:08.961 --> 02:11:11.930
ARE FALLING THROUGH THE CRACKS

02:11:11.997 --> 02:11:13.198
AND WE MAY NOT KNOW ABOUT THEM.

02:11:13.265 --> 02:11:15.734
WHEN IT COMES TO- THE NEXT WAVE

02:11:15.801 --> 02:11:17.636
HERE YOU'LL WHEN WE HAD- MORE

02:11:17.703 --> 02:11:19.871
CONCERTS A LOT OF PEOPLE TOOK

02:11:19.938 --> 02:11:21.139
SOLACE IN THAT THIS CONDITION

02:11:21.206 --> 02:11:23.442
WAS- OVER THIS PERIOD- TREATED

02:11:23.508 --> 02:11:26.111
INDIVIDUALS LESS SEVERELY BUT AS

02:11:26.178 --> 02:11:28.013
WE HAVE HEARD MULTIPLE TIMES

02:11:28.080 --> 02:11:29.348
OVER TODAY- LET. A SEVERE

02:11:29.414 --> 02:11:30.649
INFECTION IS NOT REQUIRED IN

02:11:30.716 --> 02:11:32.517
ORDER FOR SOMEONE TO HAVE. A

02:11:32.584 --> 02:11:34.553
LOCAL OF IT AND THIS IS OFTEN

02:11:34.620 --> 02:11:36.755
STILL VERY SURPRISING TO MANY

02:11:36.822 --> 02:11:38.290
INDIVIDUALS OUT THERE SO I THINK

02:11:38.357 --> 02:11:41.026
THAT. EDUCATION ABOUT WHO CAN

02:11:41.093 --> 02:11:43.262
GET LONGER WHO'S AT RISK FOR

02:11:43.328 --> 02:11:45.330
THIS AND HOW LONG YOU CAN REALLY

02:11:45.397 --> 02:11:46.465
LAST. IS SOMETHING ELSE THAT WE

02:11:46.531 --> 02:11:48.267
NEED TO FOCUS IN ON. AND OF

02:11:48.333 --> 02:11:49.268
COURSE THERE'S ALSO THE

02:11:49.334 --> 02:11:51.737
VACCINATION BY FAR THE BEST WAY

02:11:51.803 --> 02:11:54.172
TO NOT GET LOCAL BIT IS TO NOT

02:11:54.239 --> 02:11:55.474

02:12:01.246 --> 02:12:02.581
DO THE RESEARCH. INTO THE PROPER

02:12:02.648 --> 02:12:06.885

CARE DOCTORS. OF COURSE THAT

02:14:25.624 --> 02:14:27.426

ACTUALLY IDENTIFYING- PEOPLE

02:14:50.348 --> 02:14:52.083
BLOCK OF IT WHO ARE ARE

02:14:52.150 --> 02:14:53.185

AND BEING ABLE TO FIND. OUR

02:15:04.596 --> 02:15:05.864
COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS

02:15:05.931 --> 02:15:06.865

THOSE THAT ARE TRUSTED

02:15:07.732 --> 02:15:09.201
MESSENGERS. AND BEING ABLE TO

02:15:09.267 --> 02:15:12.270
DELIVER. THIS INFORMATION. AND I

02:15:12.337 --> 02:15:14.105
CERTAINLY ANTICIPATE THAT WE'RE

02:15:14.172 --> 02:15:15.807
UNDER DIAGNOSING AND UNDER

02:15:15.874 --> 02:15:17.709
EVALUATING. THE AMOUNT OF LONG

02:15:17.776 --> 02:15:19.244
CODE THAT ARE IN THESE

02:15:19.311 --> 02:15:20.278
COMMUNITIES AND COMMUNITIES OF

02:15:20.345 --> 02:15:22.047
COLOR. AND NOT PART OF THAT

02:15:22.113 --> 02:15:23.348
COMES FROM MY EXPERIENCE WITH

02:15:23.415 --> 02:15:25.317
TALKING WITH PEOPLE AND LEADERS

02:15:25.383 --> 02:15:27.219
IN THESE COMMUNITIES. AS WE WORK

02:15:27.285 --> 02:15:29.120
ON SOME OF THESE LONG CORPORATE

02:15:29.187 --> 02:15:30.288
EFFORTS. AND WHAT I'VE HEARD

02:15:30.355 --> 02:15:31.923
FROM SOME OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS

02:15:31.990 --> 02:15:33.558
IS. I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO

02:15:33.625 --> 02:15:34.559
CONCENTRATE IN A REALLY LONG

02:15:34.626 --> 02:15:36.495
TIME I HAD CALLED IT. AND I'VE

02:15:36.561 --> 02:15:37.929
BEEN HAVING THIS THIS PROBLEM

02:15:37.996 --> 02:15:39.431
SINCE THAT I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE

02:15:39.498 --> 02:15:40.732
TO CONCENTRATE I'VE LOST MY

02:15:40.799 --> 02:15:42.501
MEMORY BUT I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT

02:15:42.567 --> 02:15:44.102
IS. SO PEOPLE DON'T HAVE WORDS

02:15:44.169 --> 02:15:45.270
FOR IT THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT

02:15:45.337 --> 02:15:46.338
THEY'RE EXPERIENCING THEY JUST

02:15:46.404 --> 02:15:47.772
KNOW THEY'RE SUFFERING. I THINK

02:15:47.839 --> 02:15:49.207
THAT'S WHY IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT

02:15:49.274 --> 02:15:50.308

THROUGH ALL OF OUR- TRUSTED

02:15:53.645 --> 02:15:57.616
PARTNERSHIPS. BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE

02:15:57.682 --> 02:15:58.750
SUFFERING AND THEY DON'T EVEN
