THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER AND MEMBER SAU I RISE TODAY TO INTO REDUCE ACR TWO FORTY FIVE ESTABLISHING TOMORROW. JUNE FIFTH TWENTY EIGHTEEN AS RONALD REAGAN DAY. IT IS AN HONOR TO REPRESENT TO PRESENT THIS RESOLUTION REMEMBERING A MAN WHO WORKED THROUGHOUT HIS LIFE SERVING FREEDOM AND ADVANCING THE PUBLIC GOOD. RONALD REAGAN ACHIEVED A GREAT MANY THINGS DURING HIS TIME IN PUBLIC SERVICE. AMONG WHICH WAS BEING THE ONLY PERSON IN CALIFORNIA'S ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY HERE HISTORY. TO BE ELECTED TO BOTH THE OFFICES OF GOVERNOR OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. AS PRESIDENT HE DISPLAYED A STEADFAST COMMITMENT TO OUR ARMED FORCES AND NEVER HESITATED TO GIVE CREDIT WHERE CREDIT WAS DUE. HE RECOGNIZED THAT THE SOLDIER THE SAILOR THE AIRMEN AND THE MARINE IN THE UNITED STATES AND AROUND THE WORLD ARE THE ULTIMATE GUARDIANS OF OUR FREEDOM TO SAY WHAT WE WANT TO SAY WHAT WE THINK GO WHERE WE WILL. CHOOSE WHAT WE WANT WHO WE WANT FOR OUR LEADERS AND PRAY AS WE WISH. HIS POLICY OF PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH HELP CREATE A SAFER FREER WORLD. REVIVING FAITH IN THE PRESIDENCY AS WELL AS IN OUR COUNTRY. PRESIDENT REAGAN AND I SHARE A LOVE OF ACTING AND CONSEQUENTLY ARE MEMBERS OF THE SCREEN ACTORS GUILD. PRESIDENT REAGAN SUCCESSFUL ACTING CAREER SPANNING OVER SEVERAL DECADES ACTUALLY RESULTED IN THE EVENTUAL LIFE LONG NICKNAME THE GIPPER AFTER HIS NINETEEN FORTY PERFORMANCE AS NOTRE DAME FOOTBALL PLAYER. GEORGE GIPP. TOMORROW WILL MARK THE FOURTEENTH ANNIVERSARY OF PRESIDENT REAGAN'S PASSING AND IN HONOR OF THAT I WANT TO BRING UP ONE OF HIS LESSER KNOWN BUT EQUALLY IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE WORLD. HIS HAND WRITTEN NINETEEN NINETY FOUR LETTER TO THE PUBLIC ANNOUNCING THAT HERE BAKED DIAGNOSED WITH ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE. WITH MILLIONS OF AMERICAN FAMILIES IMPACTED BY ALZHEIMER'S. HIS ACT OF CANDOR PAVE THE WAY FOR GREATER PUBLIC AWARENESS AND INCREASED RESEARCH FUNDING TOWARD FINDING A CURE.

I AM PROUD TO REPRESENT THE RONALD REAGAN LIBRARY IN SIMI VALLEY WITHIN MY DISTRICT AND HOPE TO CONTINUE TO PROMOTE THE LEGACY OF A PRESIDENT THAT INSPIRED AMERICANS TO ACT. AND ACHIEVE EVEN MORE THAN THEY EVER IMAGINED. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND OPPORTUNITY PRESENT ACR TWO FORTY FIVE I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AYE VOTE AND ASK FOR THE FIRST ROLE BE OPEN FOR CO AUTHORS. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER GONZALEZ FLETCHER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU I'M. MADAM SPEAKER I RISE UNFORTUNATELY. TO OPPOSE THIS RESOLUTION AND WHILE I APPRECIATE THAT EVERYBODY. MAY HAVE A DIFFERENT VIEW AYE I A SUFFER EVERY DAY THAT I HEAR THIS GREAT LEGACY THAT WERE SUPPOSED TO. HONOR. BECAUSE THE TRUTH IS LIKE ANY FORMER PRESIDENT RONALD REAGAN WAS PRETTY COMPLICATED. UNLIKE EVERY FORM PRESIDENT HE DID A LOT OF THINGS THAT HAVE. REALLY LEFT A LEGACY FOR US IN THIS CHAMBER THAT WE'VE SPENT MONTHS IN YEARS TRYING TO AND YOU. LET'S NOT FORGET IT. SUPPORTED APARTHEID IN SOUTH AFRICA. IGNORED THE SPREAD OF AIDS IN THE EPIDEMIC THAT BECAME MAIDS. THEN HE CLOSED. STATE HOSPITALS. IT SERVE THE MENTALLY ILL WHICH LEADS THE NUMBER OF HOMELESS THAT WE SEE ON OUR STREETS TODAY SOMETHING WE DEAL WITH TIME AND TIME AGAIN AND THIS LEGISLATURE TRYING TO FIX. THE START OF THE WAR ON DRUGS SUPPOSEDLY. A WAR THAT WAS REALLY WAGED. ON PEOPLE WHO HAD. BASICALLY IN AND SOME OF OUR COMMUNITIES. FALLEN SICK WITH ADDICTION. IT'S FUNNY BECAUSE NOW WE TALK ABOUT SICK WITH ADDICTION ON THAT OPIOID CRISIS IN HEROIN. BECAUSE THE COMMUNITIES LOOK A LITTLE DIFFERENT. BUT IT WASN'T ANY DIFFERENT FOR OUR COMMUNITIES WHEN THAT WAR ON DRUGS STARTED. BECAUSE THAT CYCLE OF ADDICTION WAS STARTING LARGELY FROM PEOPLE DISTURBING THOSE DRUGS IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND NOBODY STOOD UP THEM. BUT THERE ARE NUMBER REASONS I COULD STAND IN AND RAIL AGAINST RONALD REAGAN I DO HAVE TO KNOW THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE MY DISTRICT WHO ARE HAPPY THAT HE PROVIDED AMNESTY FOR THEM. BUT THAT'S. THERE'S ONE REASON IN PARTICULAR BECAUSE I COME FROM WHERE I COME FROM AND THAT'S ORGANIZED LABOR. AND HERE WE ARE ON THE EVE OF A DECISION BY THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT. BUT THE RIGHT GLEEFULLY THINKS WILL DESTROY PUBLIC SECTOR UNIONS THE JANICE DECISION. IN WE KNOW THAT WHAT RONALD REAGAN DID ON AUGUST FIFTH NINETEEN EIGHTY ONE LED THE PATH TO WHAT WE'RE GOING TO SEE LATER THIS MONTH. HE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HISTORY. NOT ONLY FIRED BUT BLACKBALLED ELEVEN THOUSAND WORKERS. AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL WORKERS WHO JUST WANTED THEIR RIGHT TO STRIKE FOR BETTER CONDITIONS AND BETTER PAY ON THE JOB. AS A RESULT EVERYTHING WE HAVE TO DEAL IN THIS. IN THIS CHAMBER AND IN THIS COUNTRY WHEN CORPORATE PROFITS ARE AT THEIR HIGHEST EVER TO TRY TO GAIN SOME SORT OF ECONOMIC EQUALITY. BECAUSE THE SLOW DESTRUCTION. A PUBLIC SECTOR AND PRIVATE SECTOR UNIONS IN OUR COUNTRY HAS LED TO A BROADER AND BROADER. GAP. BETWEEN THE HAVES AND THE HAVE NOTS THAT STARTED. THAT STARTED UNDER THE HAMMER A LOT RIGHT WHAT IS YOUR POINT OF ORDER. THE MEMBER IS SPEAKING ABOUT AN UPCOMING SUPREME COURT CASE WHICH HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH HONORING PRESIDENT REAGAN. SPENT. WITH ALL DUE RECYCLING OR IS NOT WELL TAKEN GONZALEZ FLETCHER YOU MAY CONTINUE. THANK YOU. WITH ALL DUE RESPECT THAT THE CRISIS THAT WE SEE NOW BECAUSE OF INCOME INEQUALITY THE CRISIS WE SEE BECAUSE THE ATTACKS ON ORGANIZED LABOR THE CRISIS WE SEE ON PEOPLE'S CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO JOIN. A UNION AND HAVE SOMEBODY COLLECTIVELY BARGAINED FOR THEM WAS BECAUSE OF WHAT RONALD REAGAN DID TO THOSE ELEVEN THOUSAND WORKERS. SO TODAY I'M NOT STAND. WITH THOSE PATCO WORKERS AND I'M GONNA VOTE AGAINST RONALD REAGAN DAY AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK THAT. YOU LOOK INSIDE YOUR SOUL IN THINK WHETHER YOU WANT TO VOTE TO SUPPORT THE STATE AS WELL THANK YOU. THANK YOU SEEING NO FURTHER. A SUMMER MATHIS YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER MEMBERS IT IS SOMEBODY I GREW UP IN THE HEART OF THE CENTRAL VALLEY. WHO WHO'S WHO'S PROUD TO SAY I GREW UP ON? GOD JESUS AND RONALD REAGAN. I STAND IN SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE. ARE WE WERE TALKING ABOUT A MAN THAT BELIEVED IN A BIG TENT AMEND THE BELIEVE IN WORKING WITH EVERYBODY TO GET THINGS DONE FOR THE BETTERMENT OF SOCIETY. THAT'S WHAT REAGAN WAS ABOUT THAT'S WHAT WE'RE VOTING ABOUT HERE TODAY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBER MERCY TO YOUR RECOGNIZED THANK YOU VERY MUCH IDEA. WOULD LIKE TO THANK. MY COLLEAGUE FROM SOUTH FLORIDA FOR INTRODUCING THIS RESOLUTION. I ALSO WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN DIEGO. FOR HIGHLIGHTING THE ABYSMAL RECORD. OF PRESIDENT REAGAN AS IT RELATES TO THE LABOR MOVEMENT. BUT I DO WANT TO EMPHASIZE THE ONE THING. THAT PRESIDENT REAGAN DID GET RIGHT. THERE'S THAT HE SUPPORTED AN INCREASE IN THE FEDERAL GAS TAX. THAT WOULD FUND HIGHWAYS BRIDGES AND MASS TRANSIT. AND AS WEEKLY RADIO ADDRESS IN NINETEEN EIGHTY ONE. YOU HAVE STATED. WE SIMPLY CANNOT ALLOW THIS MAGNIFICENT SYSTEM TO DETECT. THEN DEMOCRATS WOULD WORK ACROSS PARTY LINES TO INVEST IN INFRASTRUCTURE AND INVEST IN OUR ECONOMY. WE NEED. THOSE TIMES TO RETURN WE NEED THAT KIND OF BI PARTISANSHIP TO INVEST IN INFRASTRUCTURE. FOR THAT REASON I WAS SUPPORTING THE RESOLUTION. THANK YOU SO MEMBER HARPER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MADAM SPEAKER MEMBERS IF I CAN SUBMIT SOME CORRECTIONS. NO RONALD REAGAN DID NOT SUPPORT APARTHEID APARTHEID WAS THE DECISION THE SOUTH OF SOUTH AFRICA. NO THE WAR ON DRUGS WAS NOT FROM RONALD REAGAN. THE WAR ON DRUGS WAS A TERM POPULARIZED UNDER RICHARD NIXON DECADES BEFORE. AND NO. ON THE LABOR MOVEMENT. NO MATTER HOW MUCH REVISIONIST HISTORY YOU TRY TO PUT UP IN THIS CHAMBER. WELLREAGAN WAS THE PRESIDENT SCREEN ACTOR'S GUILD. I AM TIRED IS REWRITING OF HISTORY BY THE LEFT. JUST BY FIAT WE CAN ADOPT THE PEOPLE'S HISTORY THE UNITED STATES IT IS THE HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES. RONALD REAGAN WAS NOT ONLY GOVERNOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BUT ONE OF THE GREATEST PRESIDENT THIS COUNTRY HAS EVER HAD. AND I RESPECTFULLY URGE AN AYE VOTE OVER THE REVISIONISTS AND THE LEFTISTS IN THIS CHAMBER. THANK YOU. SEEN NO FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE SOME UPPER ACOSTA WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE ARE YOU REQUESTING COAUTHORS. YES I AM REQUESTING CO AUTHORS AND I WOULD JUST LIKE TO SAY THAT.

A LIBRARY IN MY DISTRICT AND I INVITE EVERYONE TO VISIT FRIEND OR FOE. OPPONENT OR PROPONENT GO AND VISIT THE RONALD REAGAN LIBRARY LEARN ABOUT MODERN CONTEMPORARY HISTORY AND A MAN THAT STOOD UP TO TOTALITARIANISM THROUGHOUT THE WORLD.

FOR MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WE OFTEN IN THIS CHAMBER TALK ABOUT PEOPLE WANTING TO COME TO THIS COUNTRY AND START A BETTER LIFE WELL IT'S BECAUSE OF SOME OF THE THINGS THAT RONALD REAGAN STOOD FOR. THAT PEOPLE CONTINUE TO WANT TO COME TO THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA WARTS AND ALL. AND WHY WILL TELL YOU THIS RONALD REAGAN WAS A MAN WHO LOVED HIS COUNTRY WHO LOVE HIS COMMUNITY AND LIKE MUCH LIKE MANY OF US IN AND I WILL ASSUME ALL OF US IN THIS ROOM. LOVE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND HAVE HAVE A PASSION FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND SO I I APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT WE HAVE A A ROBUST DEBATE. ON OF THE FLAWS. OF A MAN. BUT ALSO I THINK IT'S FAIR TO POINT OUT SOME OF THE STRENGTHS OF A LEADER WHO STOOD DOWN TYRANTS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD AND DIDN'T BLINK AND THAT IS WHY WE HAVE A MUCH FREER MUCH SAFER WORLD THAT WE.
