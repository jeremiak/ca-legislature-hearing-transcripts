I'M ONE OF THE CHALLENGES OF THE NEW ERA AND THE POST ME TO ERA IS HOW WE COME UP WITH POLICY. AYE WITH POLICIES THAT REALLY PROTECT ON WOMEN WORKERS IN ALL DIFFERENT KINDS OF INDUSTRIES THAT REALLY ADDRESS THE DATA DAY EXPERIENCES THAT WOMEN HAVE AND THE WOMEN OF UNITE HERE HAVE REALLY BEEN AT THE FOREFRONT OF THIS MOVEMENT THEY HAVE BEEN SPEAKING OUT. THEY HAVE BEEN FIGHTING BACK THEY HAVE BEEN EMPOWERED THROUGH THEIR UNION TO BECOME LEADERS TO TELL THEIR STORIES AND TO CRAFT THE RIGHT POLICY PRESCRIPTIONS SO WE'RE VERY PLEASED TO BE HERE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE AND TO STAND WITH THEM IN THE FIGHT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU OTHERS WHO WISH TO ADD ON IN SUPPORT. ANYONE ELSE WISHING TO ADD ON IN SUPPORT OF THE MEASURE. A SCENE NINE IS THERE ANY OPPOSITION PLEASE COME FORWARD. GOOD AFTERNOON. CHAIRMAN MEMBERS JOHN CALDWELL THE BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA HOTEL LODGING ASSOCIATION. FIRST MY SYMPATHY TO THE WITNESS. FOR SITUATION BUT WELL NO INDUSTRY IS IMMUNE TO DEALING WITH THE AYE ISSUES OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT THE HOTEL INDUSTRY IS COMMITTED TO RAISING THE AWARENESS OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT. AND PROVIDING HOTEL OPERATORS. WITH THAT THE TRAINING TOOLS AND RESOURCES TO EDUCATE EMPLOYEES ON IDENTIFYING AND REPORTING SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND ASSAULT. HOTEL INDUSTRY EMPLOYEES RECEIVE EXTENSIVE TRAINING TO PROTECT THEMSELVES AGAINST HARASSMENT AND OTHER CRIMINAL ACTIVITY. FURTHER EMPLOYEES ARE TRAINED TO NOTIFY THEIR SUPERVISORS MANAGEMENT TEAMS LAW ENFORCEMENT WHEN THE INCIDENT OCCURS. OUR HOTEL BRANDS ARE IMPLEMENTING BEST PRACTICES TECHNOLOGY AND WORKING WITH SAFETY EXPERTS TO DEVELOP PROTOCOLS AND PROCEDURES TO COMBAT THE ISSUE OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT TO KEEP. BOTH OUR EMPLOYEES AND OUR GUESTS SAVE. IN ADDITION TO THE EXTENT OF TRAINING OUR EMPLOYEES RECEIVE. TO PROTECT THEMSELVES AGAINST HARASSMENT OTHER CRIMINAL ACTIVITY INCLUDING TRAINING TO NOTIFY THEIR SUPERVISORS MANAGEMENT TEAMS AND LAW ENFORCEMENT. WHEN ANY INCIDENT OCCURS THE HOTEL INDUSTRY IS WORKING SPECIFICALLY TO PROTECT HOUSEKEEPERS. FOR EXAMPLE IN LONG BEACH THE OFFICE DISTRICT. THE LOCAL TO HOTEL ASSOCIATION HOLDS QUARTERLY MEETINGS WITH THE LONG BEACH STE A CHIEF OF POLICE. AS WELL AS QUARTERLY REVIEWS OF THE CITY COUNCIL PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE. AND ADDITIONALLY THE HOTELS MAINTAIN A PARTNERSHIP WITH THE DOWNTOWN LONG BEACH SECURITY ALLIANCE. RECEIVED FEEDBACK FROM THE CALIFORNIA HOTEL LODGING ASSOCIATION SECURITIES DIRECTORS ALLIANCE AND UTILIZE GLOBAL HOTEL BRAND IMPROPERLY SPECIFIC SAFETY AND SECURITY PROGRAMS. INCLUDING. SEE SOMETHING SAY SOMETHING INITIATIVES. MOST ARE TELLS HAVE HAD TRAINING PROGRAMS IN THE PAST IN PLACE FOR MANY YEARS FOR EXAMPLE THE AMERICAN HOTEL AND LODGING ASSOCIATION. HAS A LONGSTANDING PARTNERSHIP WITH THE NATIONAL ALLIANCE TO END SEXUAL VIOLENCE. AND WORK WITH THEM TO PRODUCE AN INDUSTRY WIDE TRAINING PROGRAM FOR HOSPITALITY EMPLOYEES FOCUSED ON IDENTIFYING SIGNS OF SEXUAL VIOLENCE. OFFER ROADWAYS OFFER SUPPORT AND PRACTICAL WAYS EMPLOYEES CAN ENSURE SAFER MORE SUPPORT OF WORKPLACE. AS TO THE BILL WE ARE PROBLEMS WITH THE PANIC BUT. BUTTON PORTION OF THE BILL. BUT MY COLLEAGUES A FROM THE CHAMBER. WILL COVER THAT IN HER TESTIMONY. I JUST LIKE TO JUST OF. BLACK WAS PROVISION. OF THE BILL. UNDER THIS PROVISION BILL. IF ONE EMPLOYEE ASSERTS THAT A GUEST HARASSED HER. THAT GUEST IS TO BE BANNED. FROM EVERY PART OF THE HOTEL FOR THREE YEARS. THAT JUST AS NOBILITY TO CONTEST. THE THE ALLEGATION. THERE'S NO DUE PROCESS BUT UNDER THIS BILL THE HOTEL WILL BE REQUIRED TO LEARN MOST OF THE EMPLOYEES AND ALL THE RESERVATIONS SERVICES THAT THIS GUEST IS A SEXUAL HARASSER. THIS A CLEAR VIOLATION OF PRIVACY. AND IF IT'S NOT TRUE THE HOTEL WOULD BE REQUIRED BY LAW TO SLANDER THE REPUTATION OF A GUEST. IN TODAY'S ENVIRONMENT SUCH A CHARGE IS DEVASTATING. WHAT HAPPENS WHEN A BUSINESSMAN'S ASSISTANT ATTEMPTS TO MAKE A RESERVATION AT THE HOTEL IN IS TOLD? HIS BAND BECAUSE OF HE SEXUALLY HARASSED MADE. IF THAT SYSTEM REPORTS THAT INFORMATION TO OUR SUPERIORS THAT BANG GUEST WILL GIVEN TODAY'S ENVIRONMENT PROBABLY LOSE THEIR JOB. OR IF HIS WIFE MAKES A RESERVATION. I KNOW HOW MY WIFE WOULD RISK. IT WOULD NOT BE GOOD. THAT'S THAT'S ONLY PART OF THE PROBLEM BLACKLIST HOW THE HECK. IT'S HOTEL SUPPOSED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE RIGHT JOHN SMITH IS BANNED AT THE HOTEL. THE BILL SAYS THE HOTELS HAVE DENY SERVICE THOSE THE HOTEL RESTAURANT SUPPOSED TO HAVE A LIST OF THE MAJOR DIS AT STATION AT THE RESTAURANT. AND HUG HOW THEY KEEP OUT OF WALKING I MEAN THE PROBLEM IS IF THAT PERSON WHO'S ON THE BLACKLIST ENDS UP IN THE HOTEL. THE HOTEL WILL BE SUIT. FINALLY. THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS POINTS OUT ON PAGE FOUR. THAT THE BILL DOESN'T DEFINE EITHER ACT OF VIOLENCE OR SEXUAL HARASSMENT IN THE CASE OF ACT OF VIOLENCE TWO SECTIONS OF LABOR CODER SUGGESTED. AND IN THE CASE OF SEX HARASSMENT IS SUGGESTED THAT IT WOULD BE THAT WHAT WOULD BE ACTIONABLE UNDER THE CALIFORNIA'S FTA CHECK. I WE WE AGREE THAT THOUGHT THAT THAT APPROACH WITH BOTH THE SUGGESTIONS. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS PLEASE. HIVE ARTIFICIAL ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE WORLD SO HERE IN OPPOSITION. WE'VE IDENTIFIED THIS BILL AS A JOB KILLER. AND I WE AGREE WITH THE COMMENTS OF OF THE HOTEL LODGING ASSOCIATION AS WELL WE VALUE OUR EMPLOYEES AND THEIR SAFETY AND WE WORK TO IMPLEMENT POLICIES THAT WILL PROTECT THEM IN THE WORKPLACE. AND THAT MAKES SENSE BUT THE PROVISIONS OF THIS BILL ARE SIMPLY UNWORKABLE. MY COLLEAGUE OUTLINED THE MANY CHALLENGES OF THE BLACKLIST PROVISION THE ABSENCE OF DUE PROCESS THE PRIVACY ISSUES AND THE CHALLENGES HOTELS WOULD FACE TO IMPLEMENT AND ENFORCE THE PROVISIONS. OUR HOTEL MEMBERS ARE CONCERNED AND OUR MEMBERS ALSO OUR OUR HOTEL GUESTS AND THEY'RE CONCERNED ABOUT THEIR DUE PROCESS AND THEIR PRIVACY. WE ALSO HAVE SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS REGARDING THE PANIC BUTTON REQUIREMENT THAT IT REQUIRES IMMEDIATE ON SCENE ASSISTANCE. THIS REQUIREMENT IS TOO BROAD THE BILL DOESN'T PROVIDE A LIMIT TO WHEN THE PANIC BUTTON IS USED AND REQUIRES IMMEDIATE ON SCENE ASSISTANCE TO BE SUMMONED. IMMEDIATELY ANYTIME IT'S ACTIVATED HOW WILL THE LOCATION OF THE EMPLOYEE BE KNOWN. UP WITH THIS WOULD REQUIRE GPS DEVICES FOR ALL FALL IN PLACE WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THERE'S NO INTERNET CONNECTION. WHAT'S THE ASSISTANCE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE OUR THESE TRAINED. SECURITY GUARDS SECURITY. TRAINED RAPID RESPONSE TEAMS LOCATED THROUGHOUT THE HOTEL WAITING AND READY TO RESPOND TO AN ACTIVATED PANIC BUTTON. AND THE ANYTHING LESS COULD SUBJECT AN EMPLOYER OF CIVIL PENALTIES EACH DAY THAT THE RESPONSE TEAMS DEEMED INADEQUATE. WE SEE THIS REQUIREMENTS ISN'T THAT'S OVERLY BROAD AND WOULD BE VERY EXPENSIVE TO IMPLEMENT. AND AND THIRDLY THE BILL CREATES A NEW PAID LEAVE REQUIREMENT FOR EMPLOYEES TO CONTACT POLICE PROVIDE A POLICE STATEMENT CONTACT A COUNSELOR OR AN ATTORNEY. AND CURRENT LAW ALREADY PROVIDES FOR EMPLOYEES TO USE AVAILABLE TIME OFF FOR THESE PURPOSES AND WITHOUT RETALIATION. US SO A PAID LEAVE REQUIREMENT IS UNNECESSARY SO FOR THESE AND OTHER REASONS WE ARE POSTED. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE WISHING TO ADD ON IN OPPOSITION. NOT IN OPPOSITION WITH YOUR INDULGENCE I GOT TO THE COMMITTEE LATE I'M NOT TRYING TO DESTROY EVERYONE'S EXPECTATIONS VERY BROAD ON BEHALF OF THE. UNITE HERE INTERNATIONAL UNION AND THE TEAMSTERS IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. THANK YOU. I DON'T. IT WAS.

AND MY EXPERIENCE IN ROOM SERVICE I'VE DONE CAME INTO ROOMS WHERE DOES HAVE BEEN OPEN WITH GUEST ARE YOU THERE IN BATHROBES MAKE A. BEING YELLED THAT PROCESS BRINGING IN THEIR FOOD. AND TO ME THAT'S SOMETHING IT MAKES ME FEEL AS A PERSON S. IF I'M IMPORTANCE. AND. AND IN TERMS OF THE PANIC BUT INSIDE I IT'S HARD FOR ME TO HEAR ANYTHING THAT IS NOT IMPORTANT TO HAVE THESE KIND OF BUNNINGS WHEN. I'M GOING INTO ROOMS FOR ROOM SERVICES AT ELEVEN TWELVE AT NIGHT.

CONCORD MILITANT THE MOST LESS WHICH ADVOCACY OF BY FEW BUT. JUST AN INCH OF HEARING COMMENTARY TODAY RIGHT NOW HOW YOU KNOW JUST BECAUSE WE'RE SOMEWHERE THE FOLKS WHO BRING IN THE FOOD THAT WORK THERE. AND I AM BUDGET HEARINGS COMMENTS I FEEL LIKE.

AND ALTHOUGH THE FOLKS ON TOP OF THESE INDUSTRIES DON'T WANNA LISTEN TO WAS LARA HERE THAT OUR CONCERNS I HOPE THE TODAY YET WITH MY TESTIMONY DOUBLE YAKKING HERE WHERE WE'RE COMING FROM. AND BE IN SUPPORT OF THIS NEW LAW THANK YOU. INVESTORS. ANYONE ELSE WISHING TO ADD ON IN OPPOSITION AND. WE DID. HAVE SOME LATE SUPPORT. EXTENDED THAT WE WOULD EXTEND THE SAME OPPORTUNITY TO THE OPPOSITION IF THERE'S ANYTHING ADDITIONAL. SEEING NONE OF THAT WILL TAKE IT TO THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS ASSEMBLY MEMBER KALRA. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU SEEN RIMMER STYGIA. AND OPEN IN PARTICULAR THE TO WORKERS I SPOKE COULD BE CERTAIN THAT. YOU ARE NOBODY'S YOU'RE SOMEBODY YEARS CERTAINLY BEING HEARD BY US AND SO WE DUFFY APPRECIATE YOU. SPEAKING OF ABOUT WHAT MATTERS TO YOU. AND AND THAT'S OUR JOB IS TO HEAR TO HEAR THAT OF TO COOLEY THE MEMBERS A COUPLE MENTIONS THE ME TOO MOVE MEN AND. IN A LOT OF THE EARLY FOCUS BEING ON FOOT HOLLYWOOD IN THE HALLS OF THE CAPITOL BUT THE REALITY IS THAT IT'S IT'S COURAGEOUS AND IT'S WONDERFUL TO SEE. AT YOU WITH THE JANITORS THE HOME CARE AIDES AND THE HOTEL WORKERS THAT ARE PREDOMINATELY WOMEN WORKING. IN A WORKING ALONE IN CLOSE QUARTERS OF THESE ARE IMPORTANT ISSUES THAT I THINK THAT WE WOULD BE REMISS OF OUR DUTY IF WE WEREN'T. TAKING UNDEAD DEEP CONSIDERATIONS I THANK THANK YOU ARE MISSING MURATSUCHI FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD. AYE A COUPLE THINGS ONE IS I I DON'T. HAVE ISSUES WITH MOST POLITICALLY THE PAID TIME OFF I MEAN. AS SOMEONE TO SEXUALLY ASSAULTED AYE AND AND AN EMPLOYER DOESN'T. WANT TO TAKE VACATION OR SICK TIME TO RESOLVE THE I THINK WE HAVE LOST A LITTLE MORE COMPASSION THAN THAT. AND THE SUGGESTION THAT SOMEHOW THESE BUTTONS GONNA BE PUSHED LIKE IT'S SOME KIND OF GAME THAT. LETS GIVE THE WOMEN MORE CREDIT THAN THAT. THAT THAT JOB ARE JUST MY PROTECT THEMSELVES TO DURING HOURS OF EMPLOYMENT. I JUST TRY TO DO THEIR JOB. BUT ALSO THE PANIC BUT I THINK THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY WITH THE PANIC BUTTON ISSUE BECAUSE LIKE I GET A THERE'S COST INVOLVED WHAT HAVE YOU ALTHOUGH THEY'RE MORE READILY AVAILABLE NOW. I THINK THEY'VE EVER BEEN AND CHEAPER THAN EVER AYE YOU TO THERE'S NO OPPORTUNITY FOR CONVERSATION WITH OTHER THE AUTHOR THE SPONSORS BECAUSE OPPOSITION ON. I'M GONNA THEY'RE THERE NOW SOUTH ON APPS THERE ARE THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES I THINK. AND AND MOST FOLKS INCLUDING THE HOTEL WORKERS MANY OF WHOM MCCARTY HAVE SMARTPHONES AT THE MAYBE AN OPPORTUNITY USE APPS AND AND DO SOME CREATIVE THINGS OF THAT COST IS A REAL CONCERN I I THINK THAT. I DON'T THINK ANYONE TRY DRIVE UP BECAUSE THIS REALLY BUT THAT'S WHAT'S THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY OF MAKING SURE THAT IF SOMEONE IS IN DANGER THAT THEIR HELPED. AND I CAN'T IMAGINE I DON'T KNOW OF AND CAN'T IMAGINE ANY. HOTEL MANAGEMENT OR OWNER THAT IF THEIR WORK WAS IN TROUBLE THEY WOULD WANT TO BE THERE IN AN INSTANT. AND AND IF THAT'S NOT THE CASE YOU WOULDN'T WANT TO WORK FOR SOMEONE LIKE THAT THAT WOULDN'T WANT TO BE THERE WHEN SOMEONE IS IS LEGITIMATELY. IN TROUBLE AND SO I THINK THAT THAT THAT CAN BE FIGURED OUT. A AND SO I CERTAINLY SUPPORT THAT CONTENTION I JUST HAD WITH THE ONE IT AREAS THE BLACKLIST AREA. AND ON AMONG JUDICIARY AS WELL AS THERE'S NOT A LOT I'M CERTAINLY GOING TO VOTE FOR THIS TODAY. BUT THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR MORE CONVERSATION ON THE BLACKLIST I THINK THAT THERE ARE SOME DUE PROCESS ISSUES AND I THINK THERE'S MORE BY. DETAILS THAT I'D CERTAINLY LIKE TO SEE AYE AS TO HOW IT WOULD. THE BY HOW IT ACTUALLY OPERATE AND PRACTICAL PURPOSES AYE AS OPPOSED TO THE THEORY OF IT IN THEORY OF COURSE IF THERE'S SOMEONE THAT IS OF A PREDATOR. HELP WE DON'T WANT THEM TO CONTINUE TO PREY ON PEOPLE BUT BRING IT DOWN TO A REAL LIFE THE REALITY AND THE APPLICATION OF IT BOTH GIVEN DUE PROCESS AS WELL AS. PRAGMATIC APPLICATION OF IT BUT IN JUDICIARY I I CERTAINLY WILL LOOK. LOOK TO YOUR MORE SPECIFICITY AND AND MORE CONVERSATIONAL PLEA OF WHAT THE AUTHORS OFFICE OPPOSITION AS WELL AS A SPONSORED A AND AND AND MOST DIFFICULT HE THE AB THE JUDICIARY STAFF WRITING THAT ISSUE IS MORE APPROPRIATELY. PLACED SO I'M BUT THANK YOU FOR BEING THE BILL FORTY PERCENT. OTHER COMMITTEE MEMBERS SOME REMEMBER GONZALEZ FLETCHER FOLLOWED BY SOME REMEMBER JONES SAWYER SOMEONE ECHO EVERYTHING THAT MY COLLEAGUES SAID THIS IS A GREAT BILL AND. I KNOW IT'S PART OF MOVEMENT I ACTUALLY WANTED TO AUTHORED THE BILL AND YOU GOT IT FIRST YEAH. THANK YOU I WOULD SAY AT FIRST OF ALL I THOUGHT WAS GOING TO MY COMMITTEE APPARENTLY IT'S NOT SO I'D LOVE TO BE CO AUTHOR. IF THAT'S OKAY WITH YOU. I. I WAS CONCERNED WITH IN THE OPPOSITION'S ARGUMENTS ARE JUST SOME QUESTIONS I MEAN I REALIZE EVEN THOUGH I SPENT. COUNTLESS STAYS AT A HOTEL I LIVE IT A HOTEL I DON'T KNOW. WHAT PROTECTIONS THERE ARE NOW A I WOULDN'T SAY THAT THERE ANY AS A GUEST OF A HOTEL ALMOST NIGHTLY? I'VE NEVER BEEN TOLD HOW I CAN OPEN THE DOOR OR HOW I SHOULD BE DRASTIC OR SHOULD I BE TRUSTED BY ORDER ROOM SERVICE. WHAT WHAT HOTEL STUDENT AT WHAT ARE THE RULES NOW? THERE ARE NO RULES CRACKED. HOTELS DON'T TELL GAS I'M NOT SURE I UNDERSTAND THE QUESTION. RIGHT NOW WE'RE THE PROTECTIONS FOR A ROOM SERVICE. OF A WORKER OR A HOTEL WORKER. GUESTS ARE NEVER. TO MY KNOWLEDGE IN MAY BE AMONG THE BAY SIGN SOMETHING IN SMALL PRINT OUR GUESTS TOLD IT'S INAPPROPRIATE TO IT TO. HAVE A WORKER COME INTO YOUR ROOM IF YOU'RE NAKED. OKAY IN THAT SEEMS SO LET'S LET'S TALK ABOUT THAT THAT SEEMS PRETTY BASIC RIGHT. IT SEEMS LIKE MOST OF US WOULD UNDERSTAND YOU PROBABLY SHOULDN'T DO THAT. SO IT WOULD SEEM THAT IF FOR NOT TELLING PEOPLE WE KNOW YET IT HAPPENS BECAUSE AT THAT THE SURVEYS HAVE BEEN DONE WE KNOW THAT HAPPENS OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN. IN MY FORMER LIFE WORK WITH A LOT OF. UNITE HERE LOCAL THIRTY MEMBERS IN AND HEARD THESE STORIES SOME. SCARY SOME FUNNY. WE KNOW WHAT HAPPENS AND YET THAT VERY BASIC THING OF LIKE. EXPECTED CONDUCT OF AGHAST IS NEVER TOLD TO A GAS NOW CRACKED THE YOU'RE AWARE OF. THERE MIGHT BE A HOTEL OUT THERE THAT DOESN'T BUT. I'M NOT NOT GOING TO. SO IN YOU'RE. DESCRIPTION OF ALL THE BEST PRACTICES ARE GOING ON AND WHAT IF THAT VERY SIMPLE THING ISN'T HAPPENING WHAT WHAT IS HAPPENING TO PROTECT. THESE PRIMARILY WOMEN. WELL THAT AS A SUDDEN STATEMENT AND. THERE ARE. THERE'S TRAINING PROGRAMS TO TO TO LET PEOPLE KNOW TO TO WHAT TO WATCH FOR I MEAN FOR EXAMPLE WHEN IT COMES TO TO MATE YOU'LL SEE YOU'LL YOU'LL SEE. AND A LOT OF A LOT OF THE HOTELS WE PUT TO. TWO TOGETHER. SO THAT YOU DON'T KNOW NOBODY'S BOTTOMS YOU KNOW BY THEMSELVES AND THE LARGER HOTELS OR. WHAT IS THE STATE WHAT HOTEL STILL USES THAT STANDARD I'M CURIOUS? I I HAVEN'T SEEN THAT STANDARD. LAST LAST FEW WHEN I WAS I WAS IN THAT'S UPDATED. OKAY WELL. I MEAN I'VE ONLY I'VE ONLY SEEN THE STANDARD OF UNIONIZED MAIDS WHICH HAVE A HIGHER STANDARD THAN NON UNION AND I HAVEN'T SEEN. DUAL WORKERS IN AWHILE I COULD BE WRONG I'M NOT AN EXPERT IN THE INDUSTRY ADJUSTS. ALRIGHT THAT THE MAIDS ARE SAYING THAT'S NOT REALLY A STANDARD IN THE BUSINESS SO. BESIDES BESIDES MAYBE THE HOTEL THAT USES TO. WORKERS AND. WHAT I HEARD FROM YOU IS YOUR TRAINING THE WORKERS BUT? THE WORKER CANNOT DETERMINE THE WORKER CAN'T BE TRAINED AGAINST BEING VIOLATED. FROM FROM A PATRON OPENING THE DOOR. RIGHT HOW HOW CAN YOU TRAIN A WORKER. TO STOP A GUEST FROM. VIOLATING THEM. DOES THAT MAKE SENSE DON'T GOVERNMENT WHAT YOU CAN AND WHAT WE CAN DO IS IS TO. TO TO CREATE A BUT PROCESS OF BACON REPORTED. OKAY WHAT HAPPENS WHEN OUR A WRECK RIGHT NOW WHEN WHEN. A LET'S SAY IT'S MADE. THE CLEAN ROOM TO A SEVEN. THREE DAYS IN ROW THEY'VE COMPLAINED EVERYDAY THE PATRON OF IT TO A SEVEN OPENS UP. AND HE'S NAKED OR SHE'S MAKE IT. WHAT HAPPENS? THERE'S NO RULE FOR THE GASTRITE SIDE ASSUME THE HOTEL CAN'T REALLY TELL THE GAS THAT THEY'VE DONE SOMETHING WRONG WHAT WHAT HAPPENS. DEPENDS ON WHAT EACH HOTEL HOW THEY WOULD. SO I WOULD VENTURE TO SAY AND I I COULD BE WRONG AGAIN I'M NOT AN EXPERT I LIVE IN A HOTEL THE NON EXPERT AND SKILLED AT ALL. I JUST WOULD VENTURE TO SAY THAT PROBABLY NOTHING HAPPENS. RIGHT I MEAN I'VE NEVER HEARD OF SOMETHING HAPPENING. BESIDES IF. I'M JUST WONDERING BECAUSE I. DO WE HAVE. IS THERE A STANDARD IN THE INDUSTRY THIS IS AN ONGOING SERIOUS ISSUE THAT'S BEEN HAPPENING FOR YEARS AND IT JUST SEEMS THAT THERE'S NO REAL STANDARD. I'M FOR PROTECTING. THESE WOMEN IF YOU WOULD SIR IF YOU IDENTIFY YOURSELF ARE YOU ABLE TO SPEAK TO THE ASSEMBLY MEMBERS QUESTIONS NOTHING WE WELCOME YOUR. LYNN MORE FELT CALIFORNIA HOTEL LODGING ASSOCIATION SO THERE ARE CODE OF CONDUCT. AND MANY HOTELS HAVE THEM BUT ITS OWN INDIVIDUAL BASIS OR. I GET THE BRAND BASIS SO SOME HOTELS WILL HAVE WON SOME DOWN TO. AND IT DEPENDS ON THEIR INDIVIDUAL BRAND IN TERMS OF YOUR EXAMPLE OF A HOTEL GUEST EXPOSING THEMSELVES I'M IF THAT'S REPORTED. THAT HOTEL GUEST IS GOING TO BE ADDRESSED AND IF THAT'S NOT RESOLVED AT THAT POINT. THAT HOTEL GUESTS WILL BE ASKED TO LEAVE WE WILL REFUSE THEM SERVICE SO HAVING THAT HAPPENED THREE TIMES IN A ROW THAT'S NOT A REALITY. IN IN THE INDUSTRY AT ALL NOT NOT FOR THE SAME GAS THERE'S NO WAY. VERY BUT IF I. HAD SOMEBODY EXPOSE ME ON THE STREET THAT THE POLICE WOULD BE CALLED. OKAY SHOW BUY I THAT WE DON'T HAVE A SNEAK I'M I'M JUST KIND OF UNDER I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND SO. IT'S A AWKWARD SITUATION BY IT FILE MEANS LIKE I SAID I LIVE IN A HOTEL SO I UNDERSTAND HOW AWKWARD IS FOR ESPECIALLY BUSINESS TRAVELERS TO. YOU KNOW THE SUMS LIKE YOUR PLACE OF LIVING AND. SO. I AGREE THERE CAN BIG THERE CAN BE GASSED IN TERMS OF GUEST EDUCATION I'M AND WHAT THEY DO BUT I'M GONNA SAY THAT THE NORMAL PERSON AND THE AVERAGE VISITOR. KNOWS THAT THEY SHOULDN'T ANSWER THEIR DOOR NAKED. AND I THINK THAT'S JUST A STANDARD OF SOCIETY SO I THINK THAT WE'RE DEALING AYE I UNDERSTAND THAT IT'S A STANDARD OF SOCIETY NOT TO. TOOK ABOUT YOURSELF ANYBODY BUT IT HAPPENS AND AND I THINK THAT MOST OF OUR WHERE I WAS GOING WITH THIS IS. FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE ON THE HOTEL SIDE WERE INTERESTED PROTECTING THE WORKERS AND INTERESTED IN PROTECTING THEM SO JOHN MENTIONED TO DO AROUND. IT'S MORE TO DO A FLOOR OR PUTTING THEM ON THE FLOOR. MEAN AND WITH A SUPERVISOR AS WELL OR ANOTHER HOUSE MINUTES WELL SO THERE'S SAFETY IN NUMBERS SO WE HAVE A LOT OF HOTELS THAT HAVE VOLUNTARILY PUT IN PANIC BUTTONS. AND THEY HAVE THOSE AND THEN THERE'S ALL KINDS OF OPERATIONAL ISSUES IN TERMS OF HOW THEY POSITION THE CARTS. HOUSEKEEPERS GENERALLY DON'T GO INTO A ROOM WHERE THERE IS SOMEONE THERE TO CLEAN THE ROOM. THAT IS NOT STANDARD PROTOCOL NO ONE IS USUALLY IN A HOTEL ROOM WHEN THE GUEST IS IN THAT ROOM. THE ONLY TIME THAT I'VE EVER SEEN THAT IS FOR TURNDOWN SERVICE WHERE IT'S REAL QUICK HEY DO YOU WANT SOME WATER SO I MEAN HE'S TURNED OUT. YES I WILL. HAVE YOU TALKED TO HOTEL WORKERS ABOUT THIS BECAUSE I HAD A LOT OF. IT. OKAY MAYBE WE'VE JUST HAD DIFFERENT EXPERIENCES OF COURSE MY EXPERIENCE IS ONLY. AS HOTEL GUESTS AND THEN SEPARATELY AS A. WORKER ADVOCATE THAT I DID BEFORE I CAME HERE AND HEARD A LOT OF STORIES FROM WORKERS HOTEL WORKERS ABOUT THINGS THAT INDIVIDUAL GAS CAN DO LIKE. COME ON AND I DON'T I JUST WANTED TO TAKE HER MY TRASH AND. YOU KNOW MY TOWELS AND YOU KNOW THAT IS IT IT. COMMON STANDARD PROCEDURE IS FOR THE HOUSEKEEPER ONLY TO BE IN THE ROOM WHEN THERE'S NO CAST IN THE BROWN. SO HOUSE KEEPER SHOULD NOT ENTER THAT ROOM WHEN A GAS IS IN THE ROOM UNLESS THE GUESTS IF THEY'RE COMFORTABLE WITH IT AND I GUESS REQUESTED. INFILL THERE TWENTY ROOMS TO BE CLEANED WITHIN THEIR SHIFT. AYE OKAY. I MEAN TAKE YOUR WORD FOR IT THAT WE SHOULD ALL JUST ABIDE BY COMMON DECENCY AND THAT THERE ARE SOME STANDARD POSSIBLY THAT EXISTS WITH SOME HOTELS. AND THAT SOMETIMES MAYBE MAYBE OUR HOUSEKEEPERS SOME. SOME. VERY GOOD EMPLOYERS GIVE THEM THE OPPORTUNITY NOT GO INTO A ROOM AND YOU KNOW MAYBE THEY DON'T GET THEIR ROOMS CLEAN THAT THEY NEED TO GET. CLEAN DURING THEIR SHIFT BECAUSE I KNOW. HOTEL OWNERS AREN'T STRICT ABOUT THAT AT ALL. BUT LET'S SAY IT EXISTS OUT THERE. DON'T YOU SEE WHERE THERE'S NO STANDARD THAT'S PROTECTING THESE MAINLY FEMALE WORKERS THERE'S NO I'D LIKE EVEN THAT'S WHERE. WE'RE DISAGREEING ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS MAJORITY OF THE TIME JUST FROM TALKING TO DIFFERENT WORKERS. I I GUESS I LOOK AT IT FROM WE HAVE A FRAMEWORK FOR SEXUAL HARASSMENT SHOULD SIXTY TWO WE HAVE A FRAMEWORK FOR THIS AND WE ALREADY HAVE PROCESSES AND PROCEDURES. ARE MANAGERS ALL TAKE SEXUAL HARASSMENT TRAINING WERE OUT THERE AT THIS IS WHERE AN INNER EDUCATING AS MUCH AS WE CAN ON THIS TO BRING THIS UP TO THE ISSUE. OUR HOUSEKEEPERS ARE INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT AND VALUABLE TO US. AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAVE A SAFE WORKING ENVIRONMENT AS WELL SO WE WANT TO DO THE RIGHT THING HERE AND WE WANT O EDUCATE. SO FAR EDUCATION HAS FOCUSED PRIMARILY ON KEEPING THE WORKERS OUT OF HARM'S WAY. HOW DID YOU IT WHAT TO DO IT WHAT THE SAFETY PRECAUTIONS ARE WITH THE PROTOCOLS ARE? EVERY MAJOR BRAND HAS SAFETY AND AND SECURITY PROCEDURES IN THE HOTEL. JUST BEYOND THE SEXUAL HARASSMENT EVERYTHING ELSE WE'VE GOT OTHER SAFETY ISSUES AS WELL IT'S OBVIOUSLY A A BIG ISSUE IN OUR INDUSTRY SHOWING WE ARE ALWAYS EVOLVING IN TERMS OF WHAT THOSE STANDARDS ARE. AND WHAT THOSE PROTOCOLS ARE SO HAVE YOU SEEN SOME OF THE SURVEYS DONE BY UNITE HERE ABOUT WHAT. THEIR WORKERS EXPERIENCE ON THE JOB AS FAR AS I KNOW THERE IS ONE SURVEY THAT SADDAM WAS DONE IN CHICAGO. IN THAT SURVEY. TOOK OUT. LOOKED AT. WHAT THE DATA WAS AND IT SAID OVER THE COURSE OF THEM BEING EMPLOYED FOR THEIR THEIR INDUSTRY? THEIR CAREER AS A HOUSEKEEPER. HAD THEY THE QUESTION WAS SUCH THAT IT WASN'T IN THE PAST YEAR TWO WASN'T IN THE PAST TEN YEARS IT WAS OVER THE COURSE OF THEIR OF THEIR. CAREER AND SO THOSE ARE THE NUMBERS THAT I NOW. I'M SURE THAT THAT'S THE ONLY THAT'S THE ONLY STUDY THAT I'M AWARE OF THE INDUSTRIES THAT EVER DONE A STUDY ON BEHALF OF THE WORKERS THEY CARE SO MUCH ABOUT. I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT I HAVE NEVER DONE A STUDY ON IT I'M SURE THAT THERE ARE. HOTEL SAFETY STANDARD AND STUDIES OUT THERE SO OKAY YES I WOULD SAY THEIR STUDIES I'M UNAWARE I'M JUST GONNA SUGGEST. THAT. IN PARTICULAR. THE HOTEL INDUSTRY HAS BEEN VERY DISMISSIVE AND I THOUGHT THE COMMENTS TO BE HONEST WERE VERY DISMISSIVE TODAY AND I WAS SOMEWHAT OFFENDED BY SOME OF THE COMMENTS MADE. OUTRIGHT WITH SOME BEING I'M VERY. IT AND PERHAPS IT WAS IT. NOT. ON PURPOSE BUT LIKE EVEN TO SAY WHAT IS A MAN TO DO WHEN HIS WIFE MAKES A HOTEL RESERVATION FOR HIM THAT JUST WE SHOULD THINK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW WE'RE PRESENTING THESE. SITUATIONS OKAY. AT. NOW. I'M ALMOST DONE HERE I'M OBVIOUSLY SUPPORTING THIS BILL I'M. I THINK IF THE INDUSTRY WERE SERIOUS. THAT. THEY WOULD TAKE A LOOK AFTER ALL THE STORIES ARE OUT THERE AFTER LOOK THE MOST FAMOUS WHAT WAS THAT THE IMF HAD TO YOU KNOW RATE OF MADE RIGHT WE KNOW THESE THINGS HAVE EXISTED FOR AWHILE. IN BECAUSE I'M NOT I'M NOT CERTAIN. THAT EVEN OUR MOST RESPONSIBLE ACTORS IN THE INDUSTRY THE UNIONIZED ACTORS ARE DOING ENOUGH WE KNOW THAT THOSE WHO DON'T HAVE. WORKER PROTECTIONS PUT IN PLACE OR DEMANDED BY THE UNION REALLY AREN'T DOING ANYTHING OR IT THERE'S NO THERE'S NO REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THERE'S ANYTHING BEING DONE TO PROTECT BOTTOM HOUSEKEEPERS IN PARTICULAR. AND I THINK IT'S SHOCKING THAT GIVEN HOW LONG THIS HAS BEEN IN THE NEWS THAT NOTHING. I'M NOT SIGNING ANY KIND OF COMFORT AND WHAT'S BEEN OFFERED SO I'M I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THE BLACKLIST NOT THAT CONCERNED I'M TO BE HONEST BECAUSE I DON'T THINK YOU'RE GONNA HAVE REPORTING OF PEOPLE I'M. AND INTENTIONALLY OR WRONGLY THAT DIDN'T DO SOMETHING WRONG BUT I GET WE HAVE TO WORK ON THE DUE PROCESS ASPECT IN THE NEXT COMMITTEE WHICH HOPEFULLY I'LL BE SITTING ON. BUT I WOULD TELL THE INDUSTRY THAT IF YOU'RE SERIOUS ABOUT NOT FACING A BILL LIKE THIS WHETHER THAT'S GETS THROUGH THIS YEAR OR CITY BY CITY OR AREA BY AREA YOU MAY WANT TO NUMBER ONE. DO A SURVEY OF YOUR OWN WORKERS AND MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY SAFE MOST OF YOUR WORKFORCE ARE A LARGE PART OF YOUR WATCHER FORCE ARE IMMIGRANT WORKERS WHO FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS MAY NOT FEEL AS COMFORTABLE COMING FORWARD IN THOSE SITUATIONS. AND I THINK YOU KNOW YOU'RE YOU'RE YOU'RE GETTING EXACTLY. WHAT WHAT SHOULD BE HAPPENING HERE IN THIS BILL AND I THINK THAT THE NUMBER ONE CONCERN IF  WE WERE IN A DIFFERENT INDUSTRY SHOULD BE THOSE WORKER SAFETY IN SUCH A BE HERE AS WELL I'M? I'M HAPPY TO MOVE THE STUFF. REMEMBER JONES SAWYER. HOME. BUT AS SOMEONE. WHO HAPPENED TO TO MANAGE? A LARGE GROUP OF. PEOPLE IN CUSTODIAL. AND. AND BEING WITH A GROUP OF MANAGERS OVERSEEING THAT GROUP AND ONE DAY THE FI. THAT ONE OF OUR MANAGERS WAS MOLESTING MOST ELECTING OUR. AND AFTER AMERICAN WOMEN. AT ON THE NIGHT SHIFT. AND GET A GOVERNMENT BUILDING. NOT ONLY WAS IT EMBARRASSING AND. EXTREMELY HURTFUL AND THE STORIES WE HEARD. UNBELIEVABLY PAINFUL I MEAN. AND WE HAD RULES AND REGULATIONS. ON BUT THINGS FELL THROUGH CRACKS AND. AND WE REALLY FELT BAD BECAUSE WE CAN DO ENOUGH. AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE HEARING. FROM THE ASSEMBLY WOMAN. OF THAT. WE NEED TO TAKE THIS. TO THE NEXT LEVEL TO MAKE THIS A WIN WIN FOR EVERYONE. ON. IF I COULD TELL YOU EVEN JUST. ONE TEMPTED THE STORIES THAT I HEARD. DISCOVER STATION WOULD CHANGE DRAMATICALLY. THAT INDIVIDUAL NOT ONLY WAS FIRED BUT WE WE TURNED THEM OVER. TELLY PT. AND. AND I I JUST HOPE. HE GETS ALL THAT HE DESERVED BECAUSE WHAT WAS GOING ON. IT UNDER UNDER MANAGEMENT. EYES LUIS WAS UP REALLY HORRENDOUS. AND AND. AND SO I AS WE MOVE. FORWARD AND. MISTER MURATSUCHI I BELIEVE YOU'RE EVEN I'D LOOK AT SOME THINGS IN AND MAKE SURE WE CAN TIGHTEN UP. SOME THIS LANGUAGE I'M AND HOPEFULLY BEGINNING WITH THAT THE PANIC BUTTON. I I DON'T SEE THAT BEING A PROBLEM MAYBE OTHER THAN EXPENSE. I WAS WITH MY GRAND CHILD OVER THE WEEKEND AND. HIS NINETY YEAR OLD GREAT GRANDMOTHER'S WATCHING HIM AND I TOLD MY DAUGHTER YOU PROBABLY NEED SOME KIND OF ALERT BUTTON. IT'S GRANDMA'S OVER NINETY SHE MAY FALL AND WE HAVE THE TECHNOLOGY RIGHT NOW NOT ONLY. TO LET PEOPLE KNOW THAT YOU'RE IN DANGER OR THAT YOU NEED MEDICAL HELP WHICH CAN ACTUALLY TALK. TO SOMEBODY LAW ENFORCEMENT FIRE DEPARTMENT SO I BELIEVE THERE'S TECHNOLOGY DEPRESSED PROTECT THESE WORKERS IN WAYS THAT I THINK WE ALSO SHOULD TAKE THAT EXTRA STEP. SO THAT THEY CAN FEEL SAFE AND WHATEVER ENVIRONMENT. AND. MIKE MY COLLEAGUE TO LEFT AND I. HAVE. SINCE WE GOT HERE HAVE BEEN STAYING IN HOTELS. SEVERAL AND HOTEL SANTA. TWO THOUSAND TWELVE. IT. AND ARE I KNOW THERE'S BEEN TIMES WHERE. SIMULTANEOUSLY. I'VE COMMODITY SHOWER AT THE SAME TIME SOME OF THE BEEN KNOCKING. AND THEY'VE COME TO THE DOOR. BUT LUCKILY. I'D IN EXPOSED LIFE OF. SO MY CONCERN IS IF I. HAD NOT HEARD SOMETHING A MY SPIDER SENSE DIDN'T SAY SOMEBODY'S. IN HERE I NEED TO STOP AND LOOK OUT. THAT THAT COULD HAVE TURNED INTO A SITUATION WHERE THEY'VE GONE. TO YOUR MANAGEMENT. IN SAID THAT I HAD BEEN INAPPROPRIATE AND WITHOUT DUE PROCESS. ESPECIALLY THE ELECTED OFFICIAL. THAT COULD BE NOT ONLY EMBARRASSING BUT IT COULD BE CAREER ENDING. AND. SO I I THINK WE ALSO NEED GO FROM IN A JUDICIARY SIDE. TO ENSURE. THAT OBVIOUS WE DO NOT WANT TO PROTECT. PREDATORS. BUT WE DON'T WANT TO GO AFTER INDIVIDUALS. WHO HAVE MADE AN HONEST MISTAKE? AND ENDS AND THEN AND THAT WE HAVE SOME TYPE OF. DO PROCESS WHATEVER IT IS SO THAT AUTUMN OF EVERYBODY'S TREATED FAIRLY AND IN THAT CASE. THAT'S WHAT'S REALLY BEEN CONCERNING TO ME AND IT IN A BIG WAY OFFICE TO PERSONALLY BUT. OF AN IN A BIG WAY AND SO I. IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT YOU WILL WORK ON THIS I'VE HEARD THIS OF LAST COUPLE OF DAYS. AND JUDICIARY AND SO I WILL VOTE FOR TODAY WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT YOU WORK OUT THIS. HOPEFULLY THE BENEFIT OF BOTH. AND THEN WILL WILL LOOK AT AGAIN WHEN A. FERGUSON FLOOR. VICE CHAIR FLOOR FOLLOWED BY SOME REMEMBER MCCARTY. THANK YOU HAVE FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE A LITTLE BIT TOM. STRANGE NOT TO PARTICULARLY LOVE THIS BILL BECAUSE I THINK THE PROTECTION OF WORKERS AND IS FOREMOST AND WHAT ALL OF US WANT TO DO ANTI AND FOR MY COMMENTS I DO NOT WANT TO TO BE PERCEIVED. IN THE SLIGHTEST BIT THAT THAT WE CAN SOMEHOW DO NOT WANT TO PROTECT WORKERS AND I DO APPRECIATE DOWN OF. THE CHAIR OF FOUND PUBLIC SAFETY SOME OF HIS COMMENTS AS WELL BECAUSE WE'VE EXPERIENCED SOME OF THAT TO NOW YOU KNOW WHEN YOU'RE IN THE SHOWER AND SOMEONE KNOCKS ON DOOR NO DOUBT THEY'RE DOING THEIR PROTOCOL KNOCKING A COUPLE TIMES AND YOU START SCREAMING AND YELLING THAT YOU'RE IN. HERE AND YOU KNOW LIKE WE'VE ALL BEEN THERE AND DONE THAT AND AND I CERTAINLY HAVE DONE THAT MYSELF. BUT LIKE MY CONCERN ON THE ON THE PANIC BUTTONS. TO YOUR POINT LIFE ASSIST IS A COMPANY OUT THERE THAT THE HELP FOR ELDERLY FOLKS THE FALL DOWN THE HIT A BUTTON. AND THEN IT TRIGGERS NINE ONE ONE AND THEN THEY CAN TALK TO THEM IF YOU KNOW WHAT THE ISSUES ARE. YOU KNOW THAT IS OBVIOUSLY SIGNIFICANT COST AND TO THE THE. THE INDIVIDUAL BECAUSE IT'S A SUBSCRIPTION BASED PROGRAM AND SO IF THERE IS SOMETHING THAT WE CAN WORK WITH YOU KNOW A COMPANY LIKE THAT TO GIVE. YOU KNOW REBATE OR SOMETHING ALWAYS LIES TO PROTECT THESE FOLKS BUT THAT'S A SUBSCRIPTION BASED SERVICE AND THAT THAT IS ACTUALLY OUT THERE IN COULD BE I THINK EASILY MOVED INTO THIS PARTICULAR SITUATION. MY CONCERN IS HONESTLY AND IT'S BEEN SAID A COUPLE TIMES BUT IS THE BLACKLIST.% DOWN THE DUE PROCESS ASPECT IN AND I KEEP TALKING TO THE CHAIR PUBLIC SAFETY BECAUSE EVERYTHING SITTING ON ON YOUR COMMITTEE LAST EVERYTHING WE DO IN THIS BILL IS ABOUT TO PROCESS. EVERYTHING IN THE LAST YEAR AND A HALF THAT BEEN HERE HAS BEEN DUE PROCESS AND ON THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE. THERE IS NONE. AND THAT'S A HUGE CONCERN OF MINE. BECAUSE. WE DON'T WANNA PROTECT ABOUT ACTORS WE ABSOLUTELY DO NOT AND IF IF THEY'VE BEEN. THREE NIGHTS THREE OUT OF THREE NIGHTS AT THEIR STAND AND THEY'VE HAD THIS ISSUE. I WAS HOPE THE GENERAL MANAGER HAD ME TO THAT OF WHAT CALL NINE ONE ONE STATE IN THE LEFT AND THE PATRON TELETYPE'S HIS SIDE OF THE STORE AND LET THEM DEAL WITH IT AT A LAW ENFORCEMENT DOWNSIDE OF THIS THING. I JUST HAVE A TREMENDOUS CONCERN IT COULD EVEN ON THE ETHNIC SIDE OF THIS THERE'S SOME OF OUR CULTURES WITHIN OUR COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE A LOT THE SAME NAMES. AND SO AS WE GO THROUGH THIS AND AND WHETHER IT'S JOHN SMITH OR WHOEVER THAT MAY BE. THERE'S A LOT OF THOSE OUT THERE. THERE'S NOT A LOT OF HE'S OUT THERE ALBEIT BUT THERE'S A LOT OF CULTURES THAT USE THE SAME NAME SO THIS IS ONE OF MY CONCERNS WITH THIS BILL. IS WE HAVE TO FIX THAT PROCESS. AND I THINK QUITE FRANKLY THAT THERE IS A SOLUTION BETWEEN. THE FOLKS WE NEED TO BE PROTECTED AND THE INDUSTRY BECAUSE THIS IS I DON'T THINK THE INDUSTRY IS SAYING THAT ALL THAT WE DON'T PROTECT OUR POLICE THEY'RE NOT SAYING THAT. WHAT THEY ARE SAYING IS THERE ARE SOME VERY BIG CONCERNS BECAUSE I DO THINK THE INDUSTRY HAS A? RIGHT TO PROTECT THE PATRONS AS WELL. BECAUSE FOR THIS DUE PROCESS ASPECT OF THIS PARTICULAR BILL SO I'M I'M SORRY I CANNOT SUPPORT THIS BILL TODAY BUT I DO NOT WANT IT TO BE THAT I DON'T PROTECT WORKERS. BUT IF WE COULD FIX THOSE TWO PARTS OF THIS BILL AND I THINK THAT THE PANIC BUT IS ACTUALLY EASILY. I'M NOT IS ACTUALLY SOMETHING THAT COULD COULD EASILY BE DONE. BUT THAT DUE PROCESS IS A SIGNIFICANT SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM WITH THIS PARTICULAR LEGISLATION SO THANK YOU JR. THANK YOU MISTER VICE CHAIR SOME MINIMUM MCCARTY THANK YOU FIRST YOU MADE A MOTION CORRECTED IN HER SECOND. THOUGHT A SECOND THAT I I DO HAVE A QUESTION FOR THE. FOR THE AUTHOR I SUPPORT THIS BILL I'M A CO AUTHOR OF COURSE UP. NOT A AND AMY WALKING BACK BUT THEN. I DID I JUST I WOULD ASK A QUESTION BUT BUT BEFORE I GET THERE. I AS AS OUR VICE CHAIR SAID WHAT WE'RE ALL ABOUT PROTECTING. EMPLOYEES RIGHTS TO TO GO TO WORK AND TOO OFTEN WE COMPLAIN ABOUT PEOPLE WHO DON'T WANT TO WORK THESE ARE PEOPLE THAT JUST. WANT TO WORK AND IS NOT LOST UPON US THAT THE PREDOMINATELY WOMEN IN CALIFORNIA PROBABLY LATINAS ONLY PEOPLE THAT. YOU KNOW MARGINALIZED LANGUAGE AND OTHER ISSUES KNOWS FIRST HAND BECAUSE MY WIFE AND MOTHER IN LAW WORK AT THE MOTEL SIX OF ORANGE FOR A LONG TIME MOVES ARE WORKING SHE WAS FIFTEEN YEARS OLD. A CLEAN ROOMS WITH HER MOM FOR FIVE YEARS AMONG WORK TO FEATHER. FIFTEEN YEARS AND DOWN. AND I ASKED YOU IN THIS BILL CAME UP WHEN THE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS WAS PROPOSING. AND I SAID YOU KNOW THERE'S THIS PROPOSAL OUT THERE SO YEAH I'VE HEARD ABOUT. THE. THE NATIONAL DEBATE YOU AND I SAID DID YOU EVER EXPERIENCE. ANY OF THESE GOT THING SAYS NOORT ATTACKS BUT. DID PEOPLE ACT INAPPROPRIATELY AND EXPOSE THEMSELVES AND YES. AND IT WAS HUMILIATING THEY JUST WANT TO GO TO WORK. DO THEIR JOB AND GO HOME AND BE SAFE AND SO. IT I THINK IT'S ABOUT TIME THAT WE DO MORE TO PROTECT WORKERS ESPECIALLY PEOPLE. WHO ARE MARGINALIZED FOR SO MANY REASONS IN THE FIRST PLACE? I THINK YOU FOR PUSHING THE SPORT AND THAT FULLY EMBRACE THIS AND I'M PROUD THAT OUR COUNTY STEPPED. BACK TO LET ME BE HAVE ONE. THAT QUESTION YOU CAN BE HELPS WITH SO. THERE'S A FEW CITIES HAVE DONE THIS. TWO ONE SECONDS BRAND NEW SO WE CAN'T FOCUS ON WHAT'S HAPPENING THE ONE. IN CHICAGO WAS WAS. WAS LAST YEAR SO IT'S NEW AS WELL BUT BUT THE ONE IN SEATTLE BASEBALL ANALYSIS TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN IT AND IT DOES HAVE. VIA THE LIST AND SO ANY UP LESSONS THAT YOU COULD. SHARE WITH US AS FAR AS OR FROM THE PROPONENTS AS FAR AS HOW THE IMPLEMENTATION WORKS AND HOW. THAT'S WORKING THERE. FOR INDIVIDUALS THAT. THAT HAVE BEEN PLACED ON THE LIST AND IF THERE'S. DUE PROCESS AND HOW THAT ALL WORKS. YEAH. THE AFTERNOON. FIRST THE AUTHOR IN THE NAY YOU GONNA HADN'T CONTEXT WOULD YOU IDENTIFY YOURSELF AND THEN. A BENEFIT WITH FISHER PHILLIPS ON AFTER THE CALIFORNIA HOTEL LOGINIS OF. I CAN ANSWER QUESTIONS ON THE STATUS OF THAT SEATTLE LITIGATION. ERIC PAUL START WRITTEN THANK YOU. AND AND I REALLY APPRECIATE YOU KNOW EVERYONE'S COMMENTS. THIS IS. SOMETHING THAT I. I WAS CA SHARE YOUR. APPRECIATION FOR DUE PROCESS AND. AS OF. LAWYER AND. AND AS SOMEONE WHO. RECOGNIZES THAT THE BASIC FAIRNESS OF. OF. MAKING SURE THAT ALLEGATIONS. ARE PROPERLY ADDRESSED. BUT THIS PROPOSAL WAS BASED ON IN THE THE SEATTLE INITIATIVE. WE WORKED WITH UNITE HERE TO. DRAFT THIS BILL AND DOWN. AND IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THE BLACKLIST PORTION OF THE SEATTLE. INITIATIVE IS A CURRENTLY BEING LITIGATED. AN AND PERHAPS AT HOTEL. ASSOCIATION REPRESENT CAN. ADDRESS. THE SPECIFICS OF THAT LITIGATION. ARM. AND I. YOU NO AM FULLY COMMITTED TO ADDRESSING. THE DUE PROCESS CONCERNS WHICH THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE HAVES HAS ALREADY FLAGGED ó AND AND THAT WE'VE BEEN. DISCUSSING. HOW TO RESOLVE? THE CONCERNS AND. WE EXPECT TO FULLY ADDRESS THEM. AT THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE. NUMBER BUT I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT THEY THE. THERE THERE IS SUCH AND A DISCONNECT BETWEEN WHAT WE'RE HEARING FROM THE WORKERS SOME OVER HEARING FROM THE HOTELS MEAN. OVER AND OVER AGAIN. WHAT I'M HEARING FROM THE THE HOUSEKEEPERS AND OTHER HOTEL EMPLOYEES? IS THAT THIS HAPPENS MORE FREQUENTLY THAN THE. THE HOTEL INDUSTRY. ACKNOWLEDGES OR EVEN RECOGNIZES. BUT BECAUSE OF THE FEAR OF BEING FIRED OR BRING DISCIPLINE THEY DON'T REPORT IT. AND SO. IN AND WE'VE WE'VE AYE I'VE HEARD SEVERAL TIMES THAT IT OFTENTIMES IT'S REPEAT ACTORS THEY HAVE FREQUENT. GAS AT HOTELS THAT. AND THE. THE THAT THE WORKERS MADE MAY COME TO. RECOGNIZE AS THE. THAT THE BAD ACTORS. AND SO THAT IS THE POINT OF THIS BLACKLIST WE WE HAVE HEARD. TIME AND TIME AGAIN THAT THERE ARE BAD ACTORS REPEAT BAD ACTORS THAT. THAT CAN AND AND NEED TO BE DEALT WITH. WHETHER THIS BLACK LIST. PROPOSAL AS CURRENTLY DRAFTED IS IS THAT THE PROPER APPROACH OR NOT BUT YOU KNOW WE WE ARE. GOING TO ADDRESS THOSE DUE PROCESS CONCERNS OF THE FOR THE LITIGATION IN SEATTLE WAS IT IMPLEMENTED. THE THE BLACKLIST IN SEATTLE AND AND HOW DID THEY GO ABOUT ADDRESSING THAT DID LISTING. PROCESS I DON'T KNOW I I WOULD HAVE TO DO. DEFER TO. BUT CERTAIN SO THERE WAS A LOT OF LITIGATION FILED BY THE INDUSTRY. WITH RESPECT TO THE SEATTLE ORDINANCE. MULTIPLE PROVISIONS IN THE ORDINANCE WITHRESPECT TO THE BLACKLIST THE TRIAL COURT. RULED THAT THE INDUSTRY ASSOCIATIONS ABOUT HAVE STANDING TO CHALLENGE THE CONSTITUTIONALITY. OF HAVE THEIR GAS THEY SAID IT WAS MORE APPROPRIATE FOR A GUEST TO HAVE BEEN PLACED ON THE BLACKLIST. NOT TO CHALLENGE NOT NAM SO THEY CAN GET TO THE UNDERLYING MERITS OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL. ISSUES. THAT IS IT DECISION ITSELF IS CURRENTLY UNDER APPEAL THERE HADN'T BEEN OR ARE YOU MAY YET SO THAT'S THE STATUS OF. THE CHALLENGE TO THE SEATTLE INITIATIVE. MAKE. I THINK YOU KNOW WE WE HAVE HAD. A ROBUST DISCUSSION ON THIS ISSUE. BOTH THE. THE MANY PROS FOR THE BILL. AND A FEW OF THE CONCERNS THAT MEMBERS HAVE EXPRESSED. I I GUESS THE ONLY OTHER THING THAT I WOULD ADD. NOT WANTING TO REPEAT. I ASSURE ME THE SAME SENTIMENTS ABOUT. PROTECT WORKERS. I WOULD ONLY ASK THIS QUESTION IT SEEMS TO ME. THERE IS AN INHERENT POWER BALANCE. AGAINST WORKER. IN THAT WE STILL LIVE IN AN ERA WHERE WE ALWAYS SAY. THE CUSTOMERS RIGHT. EVEN NOW. AND THAT IT IS VERY RISKY AND DANGEROUS. FOR. A HOTEL WORKER. TO MAKE A COMPLAINT AGAINST A GUEST. THAT COULD EASILY BE BALLOTS BACK AS DISCIPLINE. AGAINST THE WORKER. AND I GUESS I WOULD PASS THOSE WHO'VE OPPOSE THIS BILL TODAY. DOESN'T JUST THAT INHERENT IN BALANCE. MAKE YOU SEE. OR SAY LET US TAKE EVERY EFFORT WE CAN. TO ENSURE BOUNCE. AND PROTECT WORKERS. IF ANYONE AND THE OPPOSITION PANEL WISHES TO ADDRESS THAT WILL WELCOME THAT IF NOT WE'VE GOT A MOTION THAT'S BEEN SECOND AND THIRD IT WE CAN JUST MOVE ON. COURSE WE WANT ABOUT. AS WE PROTECT OUR WORKERS. YOU CAN'T. HERE AT ALL. MATTER OF. HOW WE DO IT? FOR. MORE OF KIND. BECOMING TO JUST IF I COULD JUST. I THINK IN TERMS OF. BUT NEW YORK AND I AM MATH THAT THE. NEVER BROUGHT UP. IT'S IN A COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT. OTHER HOTELS IN NEW YORK NEW YORK NEW JERSEY AREA I'M IN THAT COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT THAT PANIC BUTTONS FOR THREE YEARS.
