CALIFORNIA. THE FIRST

00:17:14.666 --> 00:17:15.501
RECOMMENDATION IS THAT WE

00:17:28.313 --> 00:17:30.048
SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED AND THAT

00:17:30.115 --> 00:17:31.850

00:18:26.905 --> 00:18:28.607
REALIZE THAT NOT ALL SCHOOLS IN

CALIFORNIA CHOOSE TO

SEVENTY TWO CHARTERS DO NOT

PARTICIPATE CURRENTLY. MANY

00:18:39.451 --> 00:18:40.919
TIMES THIS IS BECAUSE THE

00:18:40.986 --> 00:18:41.653
SCHOOL IS LOCATED IN

00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:42.788
COMMUNITIES WITH A VERY LOW

00:18:50.362 --> 00:18:51.630
ALL SCHOOLS TO PARTICIPATE IN

00:18:51.697 --> 00:18:53.232
THE FEDERAL MEAL PROGRAMS.

00:18:53.298 --> 00:18:54.533
SCHOOLS THAT ARE NOT ON THE

00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:56.068
FEDERAL MEAL PROGRAMS ARE NOT

00:18:56.134 --> 00:18:57.069
ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE THE FEDERAL

00:18:57.135 --> 00:18:59.137
MEAL MEAL REIMBURSEMENT. BUT

00:18:59.204 --> 00:19:00.539
THEY MUST STILL PROVIDE ONE

NUTRITIONALLY ADEQUATE MEAL TO

00:19:02.708 --> 00:19:04.443
ALL NEEDY STUDENTS. WITH THE

STATE'S MEAL REIMBURSEMENT IS

00:19:05.811 --> 00:19:07.646
ONLY TWENTY FOUR CENTS PER MEAL

00:19:07.713 --> 00:19:08.580

DOLLARS AND SIXTY CENTS PER

LUNCH SERVICE. OUR SECOND

00:19:15.954 --> 00:19:17.256
RECOMMENDED. IS TO SUPPORT

00:19:17.322 --> 00:19:18.457
ACCESS TO HEALTHIER MEALS WHEN

00:19:18.524 --> 00:19:20.092
SCHOOL IS NOT IN SESSION IN

00:19:20.158 --> 00:19:22.528
THREE SPECIFIC WAYS. ONE

00:19:22.594 --> 00:19:24.062
OFFERING ADDITIONAL STATE MEAL

00:19:24.129 --> 00:19:24.963
REIMBURSEMENT FOR AT LEAST

00:19:25.030 --> 00:19:26.398
OPERATE THE SEAMLESS SUMMER

00:19:26.465 --> 00:19:27.466
OPTION DURING THE SUMMER MONTHS

00:19:27.533 --> 00:19:29.101
IS A HEALTHY MEAL STANDARD

00:19:29.167 --> 00:19:30.736
ADMINISTRATIVE AT THE END IS

00:19:30.802 --> 00:19:32.638
ADMINISTRATIVELY LESS

00:19:32.704 --> 00:19:34.339
BURDENSOME FOR SCHOOLS. THE

00:19:34.406 --> 00:19:35.541
SECOND WAY IS A LEADING

00:19:35.607 --> 00:19:37.309
FINANCIAL LOSSES TO SCHOOL

00:19:37.376 --> 00:19:39.211
SUMMER FOOD SERVICE OPERATIONS

00:19:39.278 --> 00:19:40.679
THE CALIFORNIA UNIVERSAL MEAL

00:19:40.746 --> 00:19:41.947
PROGRAM COULD SUPPLEMENT THE

00:19:42.014 --> 00:19:43.248
FEDERAL SEAMLESS SUMMER OPTION

00:19:43.315 --> 00:19:44.783
MEAL REIMBURSEMENT RATE TO

00:19:44.850 --> 00:19:46.451
MATCH THE HIGHER SUMMER FOOD

00:19:46.518 --> 00:19:48.387
SERVICE PROGRAM FEDERAL RATES.

00:19:48.453 --> 00:19:50.255
AND THIRD ENSURING THAT THE

00:19:50.322 --> 00:19:51.390
CALIFORNIA UNIVERSAL MEAL

00:19:51.456 --> 00:19:53.325
PROGRAM DESIGN DOES NOT HAVE

00:19:53.392 --> 00:19:54.860
UNINTENDED QUESTION AT AN

00:19:54.927 --> 00:19:56.728
INTENDED CONSEQUENCES IN

00:19:56.795 --> 00:19:58.764
ELIMINATING SUMMER FOOD SERVICE

00:19:58.830 --> 00:20:00.265
WORKER JOBS. IT IS REALLY

00:20:00.332 --> 00:20:01.133
IMPORTANT TO MENTION THE

00:20:01.199 --> 00:20:02.834
POTENTIAL AND ECONOMIC IMPACT

00:20:02.901 --> 00:20:04.136
OF SCHOOL FOOD SERVICE WORKERS

00:20:04.202 --> 00:20:05.504
WHO ARE TYPICALLY THE LOWEST

00:20:05.571 --> 00:20:07.406
EARNING POSITIONS IN A SCHOOL.

00:20:07.472 --> 00:20:09.241
IN MANY CASES THESE POSITIONS

00:20:09.308 --> 00:20:10.676
ARE FILLED BY WOMEN OF COLOR

00:20:10.742 --> 00:20:12.411
AND THEY ARE NOT FULL TIME GOOD

00:20:12.477 --> 00:20:13.845
SERVICE WORKERS DEPEND ON

00:20:13.912 --> 00:20:15.314
WORKING THE SUMMER MONTHS AND

00:20:15.380 --> 00:20:17.316
SOMETIMES YEAR ROUND. WE MUST

00:20:17.382 --> 00:20:18.850
ENSURE THAT THESE PROGRAMS ARE

00:20:18.917 --> 00:20:20.385
NOT CREATING A PROGRAM THAT

00:20:20.452 --> 00:20:21.987
WOULD RESULT IN FOOD SERVICE

00:20:22.054 --> 00:20:23.088
STAFF LAYOFFS IN THE SUMMER

00:20:23.155 --> 00:20:24.189
MONTHS BECAUSE OF A LOWER

00:20:24.256 --> 00:20:26.191
PARTICIPATION ELECTRONIC

00:20:26.258 --> 00:20:27.993
BENEFIT CARDS ARE USED IN LIEU

00:20:28.060 --> 00:20:30.128
OF SERVING MEALS. OUR THIRD AND

00:20:30.195 --> 00:20:31.496
FINAL RECOMMENDATION IS TO

00:20:31.563 --> 00:20:33.365
INCENTIVIZE YEAR ROUND ACCESS

00:20:33.432 --> 00:20:35.100
TO MEALS BY INCREASING FUNDING

00:20:35.167 --> 00:20:37.369
FOR LOCAL ASSISTANT GRANTS.

00:20:37.436 --> 00:20:39.271
ASSISTANCE GRANTS TO ELEAZAR.

00:20:39.338 --> 00:20:40.172
THIS CAN BUILD THEIR MEAL

00:20:40.238 --> 00:20:42.140
PROGRAMS AND IN HALF HE ENHANCE

00:20:42.207 --> 00:20:43.809
ACCESS TO FEDERAL MEAL PROGRAMS

00:20:43.875 --> 00:20:45.377
WHEN SCHOOL IS NOT IN SESSION

00:20:45.444 --> 00:20:48.413
AND PROVIDES GREATER OFFERINGS

00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:49.314
OF CALIFORNIA BROWN SUITS.

00:20:49.381 --> 00:20:50.782
WHILE THE STATE WHILE ONGOING

00:20:50.849 --> 00:20:52.017
STATE FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR THE

00:20:52.084 --> 00:20:53.852
CALIFORNIA UNIVERSAL PROGRAM IS

00:20:53.919 --> 00:20:55.854
A SIGNIFICANT COMMITMENT. WE

00:20:55.921 --> 00:20:57.155
NEED TO INVEST IN OUR CHILDREN

00:20:57.222 --> 00:20:58.657
THEIR HEALTH AND THEIR ACADEMIC

00:20:58.724 --> 00:21:00.359
SUCCESS. OF COURSE THERE LONG

00:21:00.425 --> 00:21:02.294
TERM POTENTIAL TO THRIVE. ONE

THE IMPACTS OF THIS INEQUITY

00:28:47.792 --> 00:28:49.928

EVERY SCHOOL WHERE THEY ARE NOT

00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:57.735
FREE FOR ALL AND AS A RESULT

00:28:57.802 --> 00:28:59.437
CHILDREN WILL CHOOSE NOT TO

00:28:59.504 --> 00:29:02.440

ONE FINDS AND WE WILL PROVIDE

00:29:26.097 --> 00:29:27.532
THE MEAL. AND BECAUSE SAN

00:29:27.599 --> 00:29:29.200

00:29:31.302 --> 00:29:33.204
IT WILL PROVIDE THAT MAIL AND

00:29:33.271 --> 00:29:34.672
NOT WORRY ABOUT COLLECTING

00:29:34.739 --> 00:29:37.208
THERE'S NO FEES. THE DISTRICT

00:29:37.275 --> 00:29:37.942
GENERAL FUND WILL TAKE ON THAT

00:29:38.009 --> 00:29:41.279
DEBT IMPACTING THE FUNDING FOR

00:29:41.346 --> 00:29:42.180
CLASSROOMS. THE OTHER SCENARIO

00:29:42.247 --> 00:29:43.748
THAT HAPPENS IN SAN FRANCISCO

00:29:43.815 --> 00:29:44.983
AND MANY OTHER DISTRICTS IN

00:29:45.049 --> 00:29:47.385
CALIFORNIA AS HAS BEEN ATTESTED

00:29:47.452 --> 00:29:49.020
TO BY THE WITNESSES BEFORE ME.

00:29:49.087 --> 00:29:51.222

FOR THE FREE AND REDUCED PRICE

00:29:52.157 --> 00:29:54.058
MEALS. DID YOU KNOW THAT A

00:29:54.125 --> 00:29:55.560
FAMILY OF FOUR CAN MAKE NO MORE

00:29:55.627 --> 00:29:57.762

00:29:57.829 --> 00:29:58.796
HUNDRED TO QUALIFY FOR FREE OR

00:29:58.863 --> 00:30:00.732
REDUCED PRICE MEALS. THE

00:30:00.798 --> 00:30:02.100
FEDERAL INCOME GUIDELINES

00:30:02.167 --> 00:30:03.234
SIMPLY DO NOT TAKE INTO

00:30:03.301 --> 00:30:04.469
CONSIDERATION THE COST OF

00:30:04.536 --> 00:30:07.105
LIVING IN CALIFORNIA WHERE EVEN

00:30:07.172 --> 00:30:07.705
THE DIFFERENCES WITHIN OUR OWN

00:30:07.772 --> 00:30:09.807
STATE. THE AVERAGE RANGE IN SAN

00:30:09.874 --> 00:30:12.310
FRANCISCO FOR SEVEN HUNDRED AND

00:30:12.377 --> 00:30:12.810
THIRTY NINE SQUARE FOOT

00:30:12.877 --> 00:30:14.579
APARTMENT IS TWENTY EIGHT

00:30:14.646 --> 00:30:16.047
HUNDRED DOLLARS. WELL IN MY

00:30:16.114 --> 00:30:19.717
HOMETOWN OF BAKERSFIELD ELEVEN

00:30:19.784 --> 00:30:20.385
HUNDRED DOLLARS WILL DO THE JOB.

00:30:20.451 --> 00:30:21.686
SO WE REPEAT THE SAME CYCLE

00:30:21.753 --> 00:30:23.254
WHERE FAMILIES BUDGET IS

00:30:23.321 --> 00:30:24.856
STRETCHED. THEY MAKE GOOD

00:30:24.923 --> 00:30:27.192
CHOICES THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE TO

00:30:27.258 --> 00:30:28.860
MAKE A LUNCH DINNER CRUISE. YOU

00:30:28.927 --> 00:30:29.827
MAY ASK WHAT ABOUT THE

00:30:29.894 --> 00:30:31.596
COMMUNITY ELIGIBILITY PROVISION

00:30:31.663 --> 00:30:35.300
OR C. ISN'T THAT A SOLUTION. I

00:30:35.366 --> 00:30:36.701
GREW RESPOND THAT MANY

00:30:36.768 --> 00:30:38.536
DISTRICTS IN CAMBY BUT FOR MANY

00:30:38.603 --> 00:30:41.206
IT IS NOT IN MY FORMER DISTRICT

00:30:41.272 --> 00:30:43.708
I WAS ABLE TO PUT SEVENTY ONE

00:30:43.775 --> 00:30:44.309
OUT OF EIGHTY SIX SCHOOLS ON

00:30:44.375 --> 00:30:46.578
THAT PROGRAM. WOW MY DEPARTMENT

WAS PROVIDING FREE MEALS FOR

00:30:47.812 --> 00:30:49.480
ALL CHILDREN AT THE SEVENTY ONE

00:30:49.547 --> 00:30:51.149
SCHOOLS WE WERE NOT RECEIVING

00:30:51.216 --> 00:30:53.084
FREE REIMBURSEMENT FOR ALL OF

00:30:53.151 --> 00:30:54.452
THOSE MEALS AND FOR THE

00:30:54.519 --> 00:30:56.287
CHILDREN AT THE FIFTEEN SCHOOLS

00:30:56.354 --> 00:30:57.855
WITHOUT PHOEBE THE BILL PROGRAM

00:30:57.922 --> 00:30:59.958
WAS STILL STIGMATIZED. IN SAN

00:31:00.024 --> 00:31:02.160
FRANCISCO WE HAD OVER FIFTY

00:31:02.227 --> 00:31:04.662
SCHOOLS ON CD BUT WHEN WE HAD

00:31:04.729 --> 00:31:06.164
TO RENEW FOR THE PROGRAM AT THE

00:31:06.231 --> 00:31:08.399
END OF THE FOUR YEARS. WE WENT

00:31:08.466 --> 00:31:10.335
TO IS ONLY TWENTY BECAUSE

00:31:10.401 --> 00:31:12.003
THIRTY SITES NO LONGER QUALIFY

00:31:12.070 --> 00:31:13.905
DUE TO THE SHIFTING INCOMES AND

00:31:13.972 --> 00:31:15.406
THE PRIOR FEDERAL MINISTRATIONS

00:31:15.473 --> 00:31:17.609
USE OF PUBLIC CHARGE. FAMILIES

RECEIVING THOSE BENEFITS.

00:31:23.348 --> 00:31:25.216
BECAUSE THE BASIS FOR THE

00:31:25.283 --> 00:31:28.152
SEAVIEW QUALIFICATIONS WORK HOW

00:31:28.219 --> 00:31:30.221

THE PROPOSED CHANGES TO C. P.

IN AMERICA'S FAMILY PLAN IT IS

00:31:34.359 --> 00:31:36.361
ESTIMATED THAT 43% OF

TWENTY EIGHTEEN HOUSEHOLDS WITH

CHILDREN ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE

00:31:52.910 --> 00:31:54.812
STUDENTS EACH YEAR AND THAT

00:31:54.879 --> 00:31:55.613
ELEVEN POINT TWO MILLION

00:31:55.680 --> 00:31:58.583

FOOD INSECURE HOMES.

00:32:00.785 --> 00:32:02.020
DEMONSTRATED THE FAMILIES LIVE

REVEAL THE CIRCUMSTANCES ARE

00:32:08.726 --> 00:32:11.296
FAR MORE DIRE. WE NEED TO LEARN

00:32:11.362 --> 00:32:12.864
FROM THIS CAN DAMAGE AND DO

00:32:12.930 --> 00:32:14.065
MORE TO ENSURE THAT SCHOOLS

00:32:14.132 --> 00:32:15.667

00:32:15.733 --> 00:32:17.869
FREE MEALS FOR ALL HOUSEHOLDS.

00:32:17.935 --> 00:32:19.404

FEELING THE ECONOMIC EFFECTS

00:32:41.025 --> 00:32:43.227

WHEN PROVIDING THESE MEALS.

00:33:07.285 --> 00:33:08.453
MANY HAVE ALSO EXPRESSED

00:33:08.519 --> 00:33:09.520
CONCERNS THAT THE MOVIE

00:33:09.587 --> 00:33:10.722
UNIVERSAL MEALS WILL HAVE

00:33:10.788 --> 00:33:12.490
NEGATIVE IMPACTS ON HOW SCHOOLS

00:33:12.557 --> 00:33:13.624

INCENTIVE TO COMPLETE THE FORMS

00:33:19.163 --> 00:33:19.731
NECESSARY TO FIND SCHOOLS WILL

00:33:19.797 --> 00:33:21.532
GO AWAY. THE CHALLENGE THIS

00:33:21.599 --> 00:33:23.101
NOTION WE DON'T LOOK AT SCHOOL

00:33:23.167 --> 00:33:24.369

PALM SPRINGS HAS SCHOOLS

00:33:31.576 --> 00:33:33.845
CONTACT FAMILIES ASKING THEM TO

THEY CAN HAVE PROPER FUNDING

00:33:39.117 --> 00:33:39.684

REALITY IS THAT OUR CHILDREN

RESEARCH IS CRYSTAL CLEAR ON

00:34:59.163 --> 00:35:00.698
THE SIGNIFICANT CONSEQUENCES OF

00:35:04.135 --> 00:35:05.803
SIGNAL OF HOW URGENT IT IS TO

00:35:05.870 --> 00:35:08.039
ADDRESS AND PREVENT IT. EVEN

00:35:08.105 --> 00:35:09.407
ONE INCIDENT OF CHILDHOOD

00:35:09.474 --> 00:35:10.875
HUNGER CAN HAVE CONSEQUENCES

00:35:10.942 --> 00:35:12.643
LASTING INTO ADULTHOOD. THIS

00:35:12.710 --> 00:35:13.811
COMES NOT ONLY FROM THE

00:35:13.878 --> 00:35:15.279
PHYSICAL PAIN OF HUNGER BUT THE

00:35:15.346 --> 00:35:17.315
TOXIC STRESS OF NOT HAVING

00:35:17.381 --> 00:35:18.883

WE KNOW THAT IS ALL TOO REAL

00:35:22.954 --> 00:35:24.355
EVEN THE SCHOOL MEALS ARE OFTEN

00:35:24.422 --> 00:35:25.890
THE ONLY TO EAT DURING THE DAY

00:35:25.957 --> 00:35:27.125

00:35:27.191 --> 00:35:28.893

GRATITUDE. AS A POLICY RESPONSE.

00:35:46.878 --> 00:35:48.012

00:35:52.116 --> 00:35:53.351
CHILDREN LIVE IN EVERY SCHOOL

00:35:53.417 --> 00:35:54.685
DISTRICT AND WE WILL LEAVE THEM

00:35:54.752 --> 00:35:55.786
BEHIND IF WE DO NOT ADOPT

00:35:55.853 --> 00:35:57.555

THRESHOLDS WHICH WE ALREADY

00:36:10.101 --> 00:36:11.802
HEARD ARE FAR TOO LOW. THAT

00:36:11.869 --> 00:36:12.837
DYNAMIC IS WORSENED WITH THE

00:36:12.904 --> 00:36:14.839
PRESSURE. OF LOW INCOME WORKING

00:36:14.906 --> 00:36:16.507
FAMILIES STATING FACING GREATER

00:36:16.574 --> 00:36:18.276

TWELVE MONTH EMPLOYED BY AND

00:44:04.041 --> 00:44:04.908
WORKING TWELVE MONTHS. TEN I

00:44:04.975 --> 00:44:06.744
THINK JENNIFER LEBAR RAISED HER

00:44:06.810 --> 00:44:08.479
HAND IS THAT BECAUSE YOU WOULD

00:44:08.545 --> 00:44:12.216

QUESTION. YES PLEASE DO OKAY

00:44:15.319 --> 00:44:17.287
THANK YOU. SO THESE ARE. IT

00:44:17.354 --> 00:44:18.756
THEY LEAVE IS ASSOCIATED WITH A

00:44:18.822 --> 00:44:20.290
NUMBER OF MONTHS THAT YOU ARE

00:44:20.357 --> 00:44:22.593
WORKING. AND SO THAT THE WAY

00:44:22.659 --> 00:44:24.628
THAT CAN BE RESOLVED IS AROUND

00:44:24.695 --> 00:44:26.930
MAKING THESE POSITIONS THAT A

00:44:26.997 --> 00:44:28.432
TWELVE MONTH POSITION IF THE

00:44:28.499 --> 00:44:30.968
WORK IS. AT AND I THINK THERE

00:44:31.035 --> 00:44:33.203
IS A CASE TO BE MADE IN A LOT

00:44:33.270 --> 00:44:36.640
OF SITUATIONS WHERE THE JOB IS.

00:44:36.707 --> 00:44:38.208
A TWELVE MONTH JOB BUT IT'S

00:44:38.275 --> 00:44:40.177
TYPICALLY WHERE THESE ARE TEN

00:44:40.244 --> 00:44:42.646
MONTHS JOBS BECAUSE THE SUMMER

00:44:42.713 --> 00:44:46.316
SCHOOL DOESN'T GO THE WHOLE THE

00:44:46.383 --> 00:44:47.818
WHOLE SUMMER. AND SO THAT'S WHY

00:44:47.885 --> 00:44:50.454
I'M- THAT IS DONE BUT I THINK

00:44:50.521 --> 00:44:51.889
THERE'S MORE AND MORE BECAUSE

00:44:51.955 --> 00:44:53.657
OF THE SITUATION THAT WE'RE IN

00:44:53.724 --> 00:44:54.658
AND BECAUSE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

00:44:54.725 --> 00:44:57.027
THESE THINGS. THAT SOME 12-1

00:44:57.094 --> 00:44:59.763
JOBS CAN BE CREATED AND THAT I

00:44:59.830 --> 00:45:00.764
THINK THAT'S WHAT ENDEAVOR IS

00:45:00.831 --> 00:45:02.433
ALSO REFERRING TO. AND SO I

00:45:02.499 --> 00:45:03.934
THINK THAT'S WHERE THIS CAN BE

00:45:04.001 --> 00:45:05.702
MADE I DON'T THINK YOU CAN MAKE

00:45:05.769 --> 00:45:08.939
THE CASE FOR ALL. OF THE JOBS

00:45:09.006 --> 00:45:11.308
TO BE TWELVE MONTHS. CAN MAKE

00:45:11.375 --> 00:45:13.010
THE CASE FOR A NUMBER OF THE

00:45:13.077 --> 00:45:14.778
JOBS TO BE TWELVE MONTHS AND SO

00:45:14.845 --> 00:45:16.180
THAT'S A THAT'S A CONVERSATION

00:45:16.246 --> 00:45:18.382
THAT CAN HAPPEN. BUT I DO NOT

00:45:18.449 --> 00:45:19.516
THINK THAT THERE IS THE ABILITY

00:45:19.583 --> 00:45:23.954
WITHIN THE AND COACH TO- ADD-

00:45:24.021 --> 00:45:25.389
OR TO ACCRUE THE TEN MONTHS BUT

00:45:25.456 --> 00:45:27.658
I THINK IT'S ALSO GOING TO VARY

00:45:27.724 --> 00:45:28.258
FROM SCHOOL DISTRICT TO SCHOOL

00:45:28.325 --> 00:45:30.060
DISTRICT. IN HANDING ON WHAT

00:45:30.127 --> 00:45:32.129
THE SITUATION IS AT THAT SCHOOL

00:45:32.196 --> 00:45:33.130
SO IT IS A LOCAL SCHOOL

00:45:33.197 --> 00:45:37.101
DISTRICT- YES PROVOCATIVE. YES

00:45:37.167 --> 00:45:43.040

TO EXPECT OUR STUDENTS TO LEARN

00:45:55.853 --> 00:45:56.753
WHEN THEY'RE WORRIED ABOUT

OF THE SUB COMMITTEE. HOWEVER

00:50:40.871 --> 00:50:42.706
THE EFFORTS THAT ARE BROADER

00:50:42.773 --> 00:50:44.441
THAN WHAT WE DO HERE.

00:50:44.508 --> 00:50:46.042
DEFINITELY IMPACT THIS

00:50:46.109 --> 00:50:48.078
DISCUSSION AND DOUBLE. AND

00:50:48.145 --> 00:50:49.746
DEFINITELY IMPACT WHETHER WE

00:50:49.813 --> 00:50:51.648
CAN MEET THE NUTRITION NEEDS OF

00:50:51.715 --> 00:50:53.850

00:50:58.321 --> 00:51:00.023

JUST FLOORED AT HOW LONG THE

00:51:07.664 --> 00:51:12.769
LINES WERE. AND THEY ARE- DAY

00:51:12.836 --> 00:51:14.971
PASSED SOME OF THEM IF THEY

00:51:15.038 --> 00:51:17.307
WOULD BE WILLING TO TALK TO ME.

00:51:17.374 --> 00:51:19.075
AND I SPEAK SPANISH AND A LOT

00:51:19.142 --> 00:51:21.144
OF THE MORE SPANISH SPEAKING.

00:51:21.211 --> 00:51:24.948
OF PEOPLE GETTING FOOD. AND IT

00:51:25.015 --> 00:51:25.982
WAS PEOPLE THAT HAD BEEN

00:51:26.049 --> 00:51:27.951
WORKING IN THE FIELDS OR HAD

00:51:28.018 --> 00:51:28.952
BEEN WORKING IN THE PACKING

00:51:29.019 --> 00:51:30.487
SHEDS OR HAD BEEN WORKING IN

00:51:30.554 --> 00:51:32.222
GENERAL THERE WERE KIDS IN THE

00:51:32.289 --> 00:51:33.857
CAR THAT WE'RE PICKING UP THE

00:51:33.924 --> 00:51:35.425
FOOD WITH THEM CONCERT WAS

00:51:35.492 --> 00:51:37.427
REALLY CLEAR. THAT FOOD

00:51:37.494 --> 00:51:40.964
INSECURITY WAS WAS BROAD AND I

00:51:41.031 --> 00:51:43.133
AM AWARE HAVING WORKED WITH THE

00:51:43.200 --> 00:51:45.402
FOOD BANK IN IN SANTA CRUZ IN

00:51:45.469 --> 00:51:47.604
RECENT YEARS VERY CLOSELY. THAT

00:51:47.671 --> 00:51:49.406
AS HE SAID THERE'S ONE

00:51:49.473 --> 00:51:52.075
PARTICULAR GROUP. OF OAXACAN

00:51:52.142 --> 00:51:54.778
IMMIGRANTS MANY OF WHOM ARE NOT

00:51:54.845 --> 00:51:57.848
DOCUMENTED. THAT ARE AFRAID. TO

00:51:57.914 --> 00:51:59.483
DO ANYTHING IN PUBLIC IN THE

00:51:59.549 --> 00:52:02.319
FOOD BANK HAS FIGURED OUT WAYS

00:52:02.385 --> 00:52:03.353
TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY DON'T

00:52:03.420 --> 00:52:05.188
HAVE FOOD IN SECURITY IN THAT

00:52:05.255 --> 00:52:07.457
SO. THERE ARE EFFORTS THAT ARE

00:52:07.524 --> 00:52:09.025
MUCH BROADER THAN WHAT WE'RE

00:52:09.092 --> 00:52:10.827
TALKING ABOUT TODAY THAT ARE

00:52:10.894 --> 00:52:13.463
THAT ARE BEING DONE AND- A. N.

00:52:13.530 --> 00:52:16.166
IN A SHAMELESS PLUG- THE THING

00:52:16.233 --> 00:52:17.534
THAT IT BECAUSE MY FIRST

00:52:17.601 --> 00:52:18.735
QUESTION IS GOING TO BE ALONG

00:52:18.802 --> 00:52:21.338
THE LINES OF. SENATOR JOE BOGGS

00:52:21.404 --> 00:52:22.939
WHICH IS WHAT THE DROP OFF IS

00:52:23.006 --> 00:52:25.442
BEEN. CUT DURING THE PANDEMIC

00:52:25.509 --> 00:52:27.577
OF PEOPLE UTILIZING IT AND HOW

00:52:27.644 --> 00:52:29.846
THAT IS FIT TO FUNDING. BECAUSE

00:52:29.913 --> 00:52:31.648
THE ONE PLACE THAT'S BEEN OFF

00:52:31.715 --> 00:52:33.950
THE CHARTS IS FOOD BANKS ARE

00:52:34.017 --> 00:52:36.086
AND THERE IS AN ASK IN SUB

00:52:36.152 --> 00:52:38.788
THREE. TO CONTINUE THE BOXED

00:52:38.855 --> 00:52:40.991
FOODS AND OTHER THINGS AND THE

00:52:41.057 --> 00:52:42.392
NATIONAL GUARD ASSISTANCE

EXPIRES. IN A MATTER OF WEEKS

00:52:45.395 --> 00:52:47.230
AND THE NATIONAL GUARD HAS MADE

00:52:47.297 --> 00:52:50.000
IT HAPPEN IN SOME PLACES IN THE

00:52:50.066 --> 00:52:52.402
STATE SO. THERE ARE QUESTIONS

00:52:52.469 --> 00:52:53.937
THAT REGARDLESS OF WHAT WE DO

00:52:54.004 --> 00:52:55.605
HERE WILL HAVE TO BE ADDRESSED

00:52:55.672 --> 00:52:57.107
ON FOOD INSECURITY IN OTHER

00:52:57.173 --> 00:52:58.575
PARTS OF THE BUDGET AND WE WANT

00:52:58.642 --> 00:53:00.610
TO MAKE SURE THAT. THAT THEY

00:53:00.677 --> 00:53:04.481
ARE BECAUSE THERE SHOULD NOT BE

00:53:04.548 --> 00:53:07.017
A FOOD CLIFF. OR A SERVICE.

00:53:07.083 --> 00:53:09.586
THAT FOOD BANKS GO OVER IN JUNE

00:53:09.653 --> 00:53:11.221
WHEN SCHOOLS AREN'T TOTALLY

00:53:11.288 --> 00:53:13.957

OFFERING AT A SUBNORMAL LEVELS

00:53:16.493 --> 00:53:18.895
OF PARTICIPATION. SO THAT WE

00:53:18.962 --> 00:53:19.930
ACTUALLY MAKE SURE THAT WE

00:53:19.996 --> 00:53:23.533
REACH KIDS AND FAMILIES UNTIL

00:53:23.600 --> 00:53:25.902

RE OPEN AND BE IN A MORE EVEN

00:53:28.238 --> 00:53:30.840
LEVEL SO I JUST SORT OF WANT TO

00:53:30.907 --> 00:53:33.276
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT. SO THAT WHEN

00:53:33.343 --> 00:53:36.546
WE TALK ABOUT. WHAT THE SCHOOL

00:53:36.613 --> 00:53:38.348
NUTRITION ISSUES ARE AND HOW TO

00:53:38.415 --> 00:53:40.350
REACH PEOPLE FOR THAT WE KNOW

00:53:40.417 --> 00:53:41.618
THAT IT'S A LITTLE BROADER THAN

00:53:41.685 --> 00:53:43.086

DON'T KNOW THE OVERALL IMPACT

00:55:22.318 --> 00:55:24.354
WE THINK ABOUT A 30% DROP IN

DO YOU IN EFFECT NO THERE'S

00:55:47.310 --> 00:55:49.679

01:01:49.872 --> 01:01:51.140
CENTS WHILE THE MEAL FOR A

01:01:51.207 --> 01:01:52.508
FEDERAL REIMBURSEMENT FOR A

01:01:52.575 --> 01:01:54.277
FREE MEAL IS THREE DOLLARS AND

01:01:54.343 --> 01:01:55.278
SIXTY CENTS WE BELIEVE THAT

01:01:55.344 --> 01:01:56.312
THIS WOULD INCENTIVIZE FOR

01:01:56.379 --> 01:01:58.047
SCHOOLS THAT DON'T. CURRENTLY

01:01:58.114 --> 01:02:00.783
PARTICIPATE- THERE BECAUSE THEY

01:02:00.850 --> 01:02:02.018
DO STILL HAVE TO PROVIDE THOSE

01:02:02.085 --> 01:02:04.187
MEALS. IN ADDITION IT'S

01:02:04.253 --> 01:02:05.721
IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT WE NEED

01:02:05.788 --> 01:02:07.490
TO DRAW DOWN THE FEDERAL FUNDS

01:02:07.557 --> 01:02:09.392
FIRST AND THEN SUPPLEMENT WITH

01:02:09.459 --> 01:02:10.560
STATE DOLLARS RATHER THAN

01:02:10.626 --> 01:02:12.061
SUPPLANTING WITH STATE DOLLARS

01:02:12.128 --> 01:02:12.995
TO PULLING DOWN THE FEDERAL

01:02:13.062 --> 01:02:14.464
DOLLARS FOR ALL ELIGIBLE

01:02:14.530 --> 01:02:15.998
STUDENTS. WHAT AT WOULD

01:02:16.065 --> 01:02:17.800
MITIGATE HOW MUCH THE COST TO

01:02:17.867 --> 01:02:24.240
THE STATE. GENERAL FUND WITH A-

01:02:24.307 --> 01:02:28.811
SO- IT ELLIE RIGHT ELLIE. YES

01:02:28.878 --> 01:02:31.781
DALY YES SORRY EIGHT SERVICE

01:02:31.848 --> 01:02:33.483
SIMILAR HEAD OF CRISTINA GO

01:02:33.549 --> 01:02:37.553
HEAD GO OF JUST SO QUICKLY I

01:02:37.620 --> 01:02:38.454
GOT FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE

01:02:38.521 --> 01:02:40.022
CALL. SO I APPRECIATE THAT THAT

01:02:40.089 --> 01:02:44.594
STATEMENT- ON THAT WHAT WOULD

01:02:44.660 --> 01:02:46.929
BE THE REASON FOR SCHOOL

01:02:46.996 --> 01:02:49.365
DISTRICTS NOT TO WANT TO

01:02:49.432 --> 01:02:54.003
PARTICIPATE MOVING FORWARD.

01:02:54.070 --> 01:02:56.072
IT'S A PAPERWORK BATTLE A LOT

01:02:56.139 --> 01:02:57.540
OF TIMES FOR SCHOOLS THAT DON'T

01:02:57.607 --> 01:03:00.309
HAVE A HIGH LOW INCOME LOW

01:03:00.376 --> 01:03:02.111
INCOME POPULATION THE PAPER

01:03:02.178 --> 01:03:03.412
WORK TO PARTICIPATE IN THESE

01:03:03.479 --> 01:03:04.580
PROGRAMS AND THE ADMINISTRATIVE

01:03:04.647 --> 01:03:06.182
BURDEN CAN BE DIFFICULT AND SO

01:03:06.249 --> 01:03:08.017
IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT WE

01:03:08.084 --> 01:03:10.520
DO NEED TO INCENTIVIZE THIS-

01:03:10.586 --> 01:03:12.522
LET ME GRAB MY NOTES REALLY

01:03:12.588 --> 01:03:13.189
QUICKLY BECAUSE I HAVE A LITTLE

01:03:13.256 --> 01:03:15.558
BIT MORE INFORMATION ON THAT I

01:03:15.625 --> 01:03:16.993
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT I COVER

01:03:17.059 --> 01:03:19.328
EVERYTHING- AS I MENTIONED

01:03:19.395 --> 01:03:20.863
THERE'S FIVE HUNDRED SOMETHING.

01:03:20.930 --> 01:03:22.398
PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND FOUR HUNDRED

01:03:22.465 --> 01:03:23.566
AND SEVENTY TWO CHARTER SCHOOLS

01:03:23.633 --> 01:03:25.134
THAT DON'T PARTICIPATE IN THE

01:03:25.201 --> 01:03:25.935
CURRENT FEDERAL SCHOOL

01:03:26.002 --> 01:03:28.070
NUTRITION PROGRAMS IT'S BECAUSE

01:03:28.137 --> 01:03:29.071
THOSE ARE THE COMMUNITIES WITH

01:03:29.138 --> 01:03:31.174
LOW POPULATIONS HAVEFREE AND

01:03:31.240 --> 01:03:33.009
REDUCED MEALS- ELIGIBLE

01:03:33.075 --> 01:03:34.544
STUDENTS AND THE L. A. PREFERS

01:03:34.610 --> 01:03:35.511
TO COVER THE COST OF THE

01:03:35.578 --> 01:03:37.180
CALIFORNIA STEEL THIS IS STATE

01:03:37.246 --> 01:03:38.614
MEAL MANDATE FOR NEEDY STUDENTS

01:03:38.681 --> 01:03:40.616
THEMSELVES. SOME SCHOOLS DO SAY

01:03:40.683 --> 01:03:42.151
THAT THE ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN

01:03:42.218 --> 01:03:43.352
OF OPERATING FEDERAL THE

01:03:43.419 --> 01:03:44.887
FEDERAL PROGRAM IS NOT WORTH

01:03:44.954 --> 01:03:46.122
THE LITTLE REIMBURSEMENT THAT

01:03:46.189 --> 01:03:48.357
THEY RECEIVE CURRENTLY SOME USE

01:03:48.424 --> 01:03:50.059
NON FEDERAL FUNDS TO PROVIDE

01:03:50.126 --> 01:03:51.460
MEALS TO NEEDY STUDENTS AND

01:03:51.527 --> 01:03:54.530
SOME PARTNER WITH NEIGHBORING

01:03:54.597 --> 01:03:55.164
SCHOOL DISTRICTS PROVIDE MEALS.

01:03:55.231 --> 01:03:56.699
BUT THE ADMINISTRATIVE. IS TO

01:03:56.766 --> 01:03:57.867
COMPLY WITH FEDERAL PROGRAM

01:03:57.934 --> 01:03:58.801
REQUIREMENTS AS WELL AS A

01:03:58.868 --> 01:03:59.835
SECOND LAYER OF CALIFORNIA

01:03:59.902 --> 01:04:01.671
SPECIFIC LAWS THAT MAKE PROGRAM

01:04:01.737 --> 01:04:03.272
OPERATION DIFFICULT. AND THEY

01:04:03.339 --> 01:04:04.807
CAN BE SUBJECT TO SOME PROGRAM

01:04:04.874 --> 01:04:06.609
INTEGRITY CONTROLS. THIS WOULD

01:04:06.676 --> 01:04:08.277
BE DIFFERENT UNDER A UNIVERSAL

01:04:08.344 --> 01:04:09.879
MEALS PROGRAM AS IMPLEMENTED BY

01:04:09.946 --> 01:04:11.847
THE STATE. ON THAT WOULD SPLIT

01:04:11.914 --> 01:04:14.317
THAT MIGHT BE ABLE TO

01:04:14.383 --> 01:04:18.087
BARRIERS SO UNIVERSAL STATE.

01:04:18.154 --> 01:04:20.289
WOULD DEFINITELY MAKE IT EASIER

01:04:20.356 --> 01:04:20.923
FOR THESE FIVE HUNDRED AND PLUS

01:04:20.990 --> 01:04:23.259
SCHOOLS. DO YOU HAVE A LESS

01:04:23.326 --> 01:04:24.427
ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN AND

01:04:24.493 --> 01:04:26.896
THEREFORE BE MORE INCENTIVIZED

01:04:26.963 --> 01:04:28.264
TO BE PARTICIPANTS. I DON'T

01:04:28.331 --> 01:04:29.365
KNOW THAT IT WOULD NECESSARILY

01:04:29.432 --> 01:04:30.967
DECREASE THE ADMINISTRATIVE

01:04:31.033 --> 01:04:33.035
BURDEN BUT WHAT IT WOULD DO IS

01:04:33.102 --> 01:04:34.136
INCREASE THE REIMBURSEMENT THAT

01:04:34.203 --> 01:04:36.005
THEY'RE ELIGIBLE FOR RIGHT NOW

01:04:36.072 --> 01:04:37.440
IF THEY'RE NOT PARTICIPATING IN

01:04:37.506 --> 01:04:38.908
THE NATIONAL PROGRAM THE ONLY

01:04:38.975 --> 01:04:40.910
GET TWENTY FOUR CENTS- FROM THE

01:04:40.977 --> 01:04:42.445
STATE. FOR THESE FREE AND

01:04:42.511 --> 01:04:44.146
REDUCED PRICE MEALS IF THEY'RE

01:04:44.213 --> 01:04:45.481
PARTICIPATING THEY'RE GETTING

01:04:45.548 --> 01:04:47.783
THREE DOLLARS AND SIXTY CENTS

01:04:47.850 --> 01:04:48.384
FOR THOSE NEEDY STUDENT MEALS

01:04:48.451 --> 01:04:50.253
THAT THEY'RE PROVIDING. SO THAT

01:04:50.319 --> 01:04:53.022
WOULD BE AN INCENTIVE. YES YEAH

01:04:53.089 --> 01:04:53.589
OKAY ALL RIGHT PERFECT THANK

01:04:53.656 --> 01:04:56.492
YOU. NOT COMPLETE YOUR

01:04:56.559 --> 01:04:59.262
QUESTIONS SEND GOVERNMENT. YEAH

01:04:59.328 --> 01:05:01.397
I WANT TO FOLLOW UP ON THAT

01:05:01.464 --> 01:05:01.931
LINE OF QUESTIONING JUST A

01:05:01.998 --> 01:05:04.634
LITTLE BIT- I GUESS I'VE HEARD

01:05:04.700 --> 01:05:06.469
THAT THE CONTENT OF THE MEALS

01:05:06.535 --> 01:05:08.471
IS A FACTOR IN INCREASING TAKE

01:05:08.537 --> 01:05:11.741
UP FROM STUDENTS AND THEN- THE

01:05:11.807 --> 01:05:13.009
PAPERWORK AND REDUCING

01:05:13.075 --> 01:05:16.212
PAPERWORK IS A FACTOR IN.

01:05:16.279 --> 01:05:16.812
GETTING SCHOOLS TO PARTICIPATE

01:05:16.879 --> 01:05:19.015
WHAT OTHER. OBSTACLES COULD

01:05:19.081 --> 01:05:20.583
TAKE UP AND PARTICIPATION BOTH

01:05:20.650 --> 01:05:22.952
BY ELEAZAR SCHOOLS AND BY

01:05:23.019 --> 01:05:24.987
STUDENTS. DO ANY OF OUR

01:05:25.054 --> 01:05:26.856
PANELISTS SEE THAT WE COULD BE

01:05:26.922 --> 01:05:32.361
ADDRESSING. DID YOU DRESS THAT

01:05:32.428 --> 01:05:34.397
IS. I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS

01:05:34.463 --> 01:05:36.699
THAT WE ALSO NEED TO LOOK AT IS

01:05:36.766 --> 01:05:39.302
ADEQUATE TIME TO EAT AND

01:05:39.368 --> 01:05:41.370
REALLY- I THINK MAKING SURE

01:05:41.437 --> 01:05:43.339
THAT WE HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE

01:05:43.406 --> 01:05:46.142
IN PLACE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE

01:05:46.208 --> 01:05:47.743
HAVE THE ABILITY TO MAKE THOSE

01:05:47.810 --> 01:05:48.811
FRESH MEALS AND I THINK THAT'S

01:05:48.878 --> 01:05:50.046
SOMETHING THAT WE'RE ALSO

01:05:50.112 --> 01:05:51.814
ADDRESSING WITHIN THIS BILL AS

01:05:51.881 --> 01:05:57.720
WELL. AT. SURE THAT WE HAVE

01:05:57.787 --> 01:05:59.889
TRAINING FOR OUR STAFF AND I

01:05:59.955 --> 01:06:01.757
THINK IF WE'RE AND DOING ALL

01:06:01.824 --> 01:06:02.925
THESE THINGS TOGETHER WITH THIS

01:06:02.992 --> 01:06:04.160
BILL WE'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO

01:06:04.226 --> 01:06:09.298
ACCOMPLISH THAT. ANY OTHER.

01:06:09.365 --> 01:06:13.936
WITNESSES HAVE ANYTHING THAT.

01:06:14.003 --> 01:06:16.439
OKAY- I'M OF ON MY NEXT

01:06:16.505 --> 01:06:18.441
QUESTION AND- I THINK YOU ALL

01:06:18.507 --> 01:06:19.875
SPOKE TO THE SUMMER DROP OFF

01:06:19.942 --> 01:06:23.112
BEING 30% AND I WOULD JUST ECHO

01:06:23.179 --> 01:06:25.181
A POINT THE CHEERLEADER MADE-

01:06:25.247 --> 01:06:26.482
WHEN I'VE BEEN OUT OF MY

01:06:26.549 --> 01:06:28.184
DISTRICT AT DIFFERENT TO

01:06:28.250 --> 01:06:30.886
DISTRIBUTION CENTERS- WE HAVE

01:06:30.953 --> 01:06:32.288
SEEN JUST LINES AND LINES OF

01:06:32.355 --> 01:06:34.890
CARS SO I WOULD SUGGEST THAT

01:06:34.957 --> 01:06:37.393
THAT 30% DROP OFF JUST BASED ON

01:06:37.460 --> 01:06:39.128
THE NUMBER OF FOLKS THAT STOP

01:06:39.195 --> 01:06:40.830
TAKING IS PROBABLY LOW BALLING

01:06:40.896 --> 01:06:43.332
IT. MY EXPERIENCE AND I THINK

01:06:43.399 --> 01:06:44.667
OTHER SENATORS HAVE SEEN THIS

01:06:44.734 --> 01:06:46.302
AS WELL IN THEIR DISTRICTS- IS

01:06:46.369 --> 01:06:47.703
THAT PROBABLY THE COVE IT

01:06:47.770 --> 01:06:49.071
IMPACTS ON OUR ECONOMY HAVE

01:06:49.138 --> 01:06:50.806
REALLY DRIVEN UP DRAMATICALLY

01:06:50.873 --> 01:06:53.042
THAT THE NEED FOR FOOD AND THE

01:06:53.109 --> 01:06:55.811
AMOUNT OF FOOD INSECURITY- BY I

01:06:55.878 --> 01:06:58.013
GUESS MY QUESTION IS THIS IF WE

01:06:58.080 --> 01:07:00.082
DO A RETURN TO IN PERSON

01:07:00.149 --> 01:07:01.617
INSTRUCTION IN THE FALLS I

01:07:01.684 --> 01:07:04.053
THINK WE'RE ALL EXPECTING-

01:07:04.120 --> 01:07:06.589
WHAT. WILL HAPPEN IS IF WE SEE

01:07:06.655 --> 01:07:09.024
A MASSIVE SEARCH- AS IT MIGHT

01:07:09.091 --> 01:07:10.493
BE THE CASE IN THE NUMBER OF

01:07:10.559 --> 01:07:13.262
STUDENTS THAT ARE IN NEED OF

01:07:13.329 --> 01:07:16.932
REDUCED PRICE OR FREE LUNCHES-

01:07:16.999 --> 01:07:18.367
COULD IT BE THE CASE THAT FIXED

01:07:18.434 --> 01:07:19.969
COSTS COULD GO UP IF WE SEE A

01:07:20.035 --> 01:07:23.272
DRAMATIC RISE IN. DEMAND AND I

01:07:23.339 --> 01:07:27.143
GUESS THAT'S THE QUESTION. FOR

01:07:27.209 --> 01:07:29.912
ALLEY GARNER. YOU SENATE. IN

01:07:29.979 --> 01:07:32.681
THE CASE. THIS HAS. WE THAT WE

01:07:32.748 --> 01:07:34.283
HAVE BEEN WITH. AT PROJECTED

01:07:34.350 --> 01:07:35.618
BECAUSE WITHIN. OF TWENTY PER

01:07:35.684 --> 01:07:37.052
PER TO. SO THAT IS PART OF THE

01:07:37.119 --> 01:07:38.521
CALCULATION THAT WE HAVE BEEN

01:07:38.587 --> 01:07:41.090
DOING. IN PRIDE. TRYING TO

01:07:41.157 --> 01:07:43.325
PROVIDE SOME COST. ANALYSIS FOR

01:07:43.392 --> 01:07:45.594
THIS THIS PROGRAM WE DO BELIEVE

01:07:45.661 --> 01:07:46.729
THAT THERE WILL BE AN INCREASE

01:07:46.796 --> 01:07:48.764
IN PARTICIPATION. AND SO WERE

01:07:48.831 --> 01:07:50.099
FACTORING IN A 20%

01:07:50.166 --> 01:07:51.300
PARTICIPATION INCREASED INTO

01:07:51.367 --> 01:07:53.269
COST ANALYSIS 20% OVER THE

01:07:53.335 --> 01:07:56.338
BASELINE THAT WE SAW PRETENDING

01:07:56.405 --> 01:07:57.440
TO. YES SIR OKAY GOT IT- AND

01:07:57.506 --> 01:07:58.641
THEN I GUESS YOU KNOW THIS IS

01:07:58.707 --> 01:08:00.943
MAYBE MORE BASIC QUESTION BUT-

01:08:01.010 --> 01:08:02.244
YOU KNOW IF WE DO RETURN TO IN

01:08:02.311 --> 01:08:04.313
PERSON INSTRUCTION WHAT DO WE

01:08:04.380 --> 01:08:05.247
HAVE PLANS FOR A LITTLE BIT

01:08:05.314 --> 01:08:06.816
PROTOCOLS AROUND FOOD

01:08:06.882 --> 01:08:08.250
PREPARATION AND DISTRIBUTION I

01:08:08.317 --> 01:08:09.752
ASSUME WE'RE GOING TO WANT TO.

01:08:09.819 --> 01:08:12.221
RETURN THE HOT MEALS IN. THERE

01:08:12.288 --> 01:08:13.122
IS THAT GONNA BE LEFT UP TO

01:08:13.189 --> 01:08:14.056
LOCAL CONTROLLERS THAT

01:08:14.123 --> 01:08:15.991
SOMETHING IN YOUR VIEW. THAT

01:08:16.058 --> 01:08:18.260
THE LEGISLATURE IN THE

01:08:18.327 --> 01:08:19.462
APARTMENT EDUCATION SHOULD

01:08:19.528 --> 01:08:22.131
WEIGH IN ON I GUESS THAT'S A

01:08:22.198 --> 01:08:24.800
QUESTION FOR. EITHER MISTER

01:08:24.867 --> 01:08:27.203
CHAIN OR MISS LAVAR. OR ANYONE

01:08:27.269 --> 01:08:33.843
ELSE WHO HAS AN OPINION ON THIS.

01:08:33.909 --> 01:08:36.011
I'M I THINK WE'RE PLANNING ON

01:08:36.078 --> 01:08:38.047
DOING IN IN SAN FRANCISCO TO

01:08:38.113 --> 01:08:40.249
RETURN TO HOT MEALS AND WE'RE

01:08:40.316 --> 01:08:41.317
ACTUALLY DOING IT RIGHT NOW I

01:08:41.383 --> 01:08:43.219
THINK THE QUESTION IS GOING TO

01:08:43.285 --> 01:08:45.554
BE WHAT MODALITY WE'RE GOING TO

01:08:45.621 --> 01:08:46.722
BE STIRRING THOSE MEALS WILL IT

01:08:46.789 --> 01:08:49.158
BE I AM IN OUR- CONTINUING WITH

01:08:49.225 --> 01:08:51.293
MEALS IN THE CLASSROOM- AND

01:08:51.360 --> 01:08:53.529
DELEM. LEVEL OR GRABBING GOES

ARE THE BARRIERS IF WE MAKE A

01:14:17.452 --> 01:14:19.721
COMMITMENT. AND PUT FINANCING

01:14:19.788 --> 01:14:21.723
BEHIND IT WHAT ARE THE BARRIERS

01:14:21.790 --> 01:14:23.725
IN ACTUALLY IMPLEMENTING IT TO

01:14:23.792 --> 01:14:25.494
AND GETTING TO A POINT THAT

01:14:25.561 --> 01:14:27.629
THAT WE HAVE UNIVERSAL NIELSEN

01:14:27.696 --> 01:14:29.131
MAYBE I'LL START WITH ELLIE

01:14:29.198 --> 01:14:30.966

ELSE THAT WISHES TO RESPOND. AT

01:14:36.205 --> 01:14:39.975
THE HALF THE QUESTION. WELL IT

01:14:40.042 --> 01:14:49.151
IS A HAVE GOAL. ASSEMBLY IN. I

01:14:49.218 --> 01:14:50.886
THINK THAT I'M I WANT TO YOU

01:14:50.953 --> 01:14:52.754
CAN OUT ON OF THE CALL BUT I

01:14:52.821 --> 01:14:56.892
THINK THE WE- I'D LIKE TO READ

01:14:56.959 --> 01:14:59.061
THAT THE S. P. IN THE APART

01:14:59.127 --> 01:15:01.897
ADVENTURE REALLY DO SUPPORT THE-

01:15:01.964 --> 01:15:03.098
OF THE DEMOCRATIC IN UNIVERSE

01:15:03.165 --> 01:15:04.266
ACCESS TO HEALTHY AND

01:15:04.333 --> 01:15:05.834
NUTRITIOUS MEALS BUT IT IS

01:15:05.901 --> 01:15:07.436
IMPORTANT THAT ARE UNIVERSAL

01:15:07.502 --> 01:15:09.171
MEAL PROGRAM BE FIX FISCALLY

01:15:09.238 --> 01:15:10.639
SUSTAINABLE AND THAT WE

01:15:10.706 --> 01:15:12.474
MAXIMIZE ALL FEDERAL MEAL

01:15:12.541 --> 01:15:14.476
REIMBURSEMENT OPPORTUNITIES

01:15:14.543 --> 01:15:15.577
BEFORE SUPPLEMENTING WITH

01:15:15.644 --> 01:15:16.511
ADDITIONAL FUNDS SO I THINK

01:15:16.578 --> 01:15:18.413
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT IN THE

01:15:18.480 --> 01:15:19.514
STRUCTURE THAT WE BUILD FOR

01:15:19.581 --> 01:15:21.149
THIS PROGRAM. WE ENSURE THAT

01:15:21.216 --> 01:15:22.784
WERE ACCESSING AND UTILIZING

01:15:22.851 --> 01:15:24.453
FEDERAL FUNDS TO THE MAXIMUM

01:15:24.519 --> 01:15:25.988
CAPACITY AND SUPPLEMENTING ON A

01:15:26.054 --> 01:15:28.023
STATE LEVEL- WE CONTINUE TO

01:15:28.090 --> 01:15:30.025
WORK WITH SENATOR SKINNER ON

01:15:30.092 --> 01:15:31.393
THIS BILL BOTH ON A TECHNICAL

01:15:31.460 --> 01:15:33.528
ASSISTANCE PLEASE AND AT THE S.

01:15:33.595 --> 01:15:35.664
S. P. I. IS SPONSORING THE BILL

01:15:35.731 --> 01:15:37.799
SO I WOULD SAY THAT WE ARE IN A

01:15:37.866 --> 01:15:40.235
GOOD PLACE- BUT WE DO BELIEVE

01:15:40.302 --> 01:15:41.870
THAT REQUIRING ALL SCHOOLS TO

01:15:41.937 --> 01:15:43.038
PARTICIPATE IN THE FEDERAL

01:15:43.105 --> 01:15:44.373
SCHOOL NUTRITION MEAL PROGRAMS

01:15:44.439 --> 01:15:45.674
AND AS SENATOR AND SHE'LL TELL

01:15:45.741 --> 01:15:47.342
ABOUT WHAT DID MENTION THERE

01:15:47.409 --> 01:15:48.310
ARE SOME BARRIERS AND SOME

01:15:48.377 --> 01:15:49.578
SCHOOLS HAVE NOT WANTED TO

01:15:49.645 --> 01:15:50.913
PARTICIPATE IN THAT PROGRAM.

01:15:50.979 --> 01:15:52.080
BUT REQUIRING THAT

01:15:52.147 --> 01:15:54.316
PARTICIPATION WILL ENSURE THAT

01:15:54.383 --> 01:15:54.816
WE CAN MAXIMIZE FEDERAL

01:15:54.883 --> 01:15:56.418
REIMBURSEMENT- AND

01:15:56.485 --> 01:15:58.520
SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE THE COST

01:15:58.587 --> 01:16:01.089
ON TO THE STATE CAN IS THERE

01:16:01.156 --> 01:16:02.291
ANYTHING YOU HAVE TO HAVE FOR

01:16:02.357 --> 01:16:04.793
YOU GO BECAUSE I THINK IT DID A

01:16:04.860 --> 01:16:05.327
GOOD JOB OF ANSWERING THE

01:16:05.394 --> 01:16:08.430
QUESTION- LET ME JUST EMPHASIZE

01:16:08.497 --> 01:16:10.365
THAT ONE OF THE PIECES OF THIS

01:16:10.432 --> 01:16:12.801
IS MAXIMIZING THE FEDERAL

01:16:12.868 --> 01:16:14.970
REPAYMENT REIMBURSEMENTS AND

01:16:15.037 --> 01:16:16.705
BUILDING OFF THE WAIVERS AND SO

01:16:16.772 --> 01:16:20.809
THE QUESTION IS SINCE WE- WANT

01:16:20.876 --> 01:16:22.878
TO MAKE THAT A PIECE OF THIS IS

01:16:22.945 --> 01:16:24.446
THERE AN IMPLEMENTATION PROBLEM

01:16:24.513 --> 01:16:25.881
WITH FACT BECAUSE I THINK YOU

01:16:25.948 --> 01:16:27.282
EXPRESSED THE CONCERN THAT WE

01:16:27.349 --> 01:16:29.651
ACTUALLY DO IT WHO. IF WE DO

01:16:29.718 --> 01:16:31.186
MOVE TO UNIVERSAL WE ARE

01:16:31.253 --> 01:16:33.155
COMMITTED TO DOING THAT IT THE

01:16:33.221 --> 01:16:40.929
STAFF REYES AND IMPLEMENTATION.

01:16:40.996 --> 01:16:42.965
PROBLEM WE DON'T FORESEE EMBLEM.

01:16:43.031 --> 01:16:44.866
PROBLEM THAT IT WILL HAVE TO BE

01:16:44.933 --> 01:16:47.069
A ROCK. ON SCHOOL AND I'M GONNA

01:16:47.135 --> 01:16:48.470
DEFERRED A CAMERA THIS BUT-

01:16:50.872 --> 01:16:52.975
MISSED CAMP NOW I YOU DID IF.

FOOD TO OF- I WENT JUST KIDDING

01:17:02.818 --> 01:17:05.320

01:17:05.387 --> 01:17:11.093
A FABULOUS. THANK WELL THE

01:17:11.159 --> 01:17:13.195

BIT OF A CHICKEN AND THE EGG

01:28:57.331 --> 01:28:58.866
BECAUSE THE STATE ALL. OF OUR

01:28:58.933 --> 01:29:00.368
BOARD OF EDUCATION HAS TO DO

01:29:00.435 --> 01:29:02.136

FOR THE SPRING. AND FALL ARE

01:29:37.004 --> 01:29:38.005
THEY'RE EXPECTED TO BE

01:29:38.072 --> 01:29:40.508
SIGNIFICANT SAVINGS OVER WHAT

01:29:40.575 --> 01:29:41.809
WAS BUDGETED FOR THE FISCAL

01:29:41.876 --> 01:29:43.778

01:30:41.035 --> 01:30:42.603
GIVEN THE EXTENSION OF THE

01:30:42.670 --> 01:30:44.272
STATEWIDE TESTING WINDOW. SO

01:30:44.338 --> 01:30:46.574
THAT IS ANOTHER- VARIABLE THAT

01:30:46.641 --> 01:30:47.441
HAS TO BE CONSIDERED IN

01:30:47.508 --> 01:30:50.178
IDENTIFYING THE SAVINGS THAT

01:30:50.244 --> 01:30:50.845
MIGHT BE ACTUALLY A PART OF THE

01:30:50.912 --> 01:30:52.780
PROCESS AND ALSO FOR THE L.

01:30:52.847 --> 01:30:54.382
PACK ALL ENGLISH LEARNERS ARE

01:30:54.448 --> 01:30:56.784
REQUIRED TO BE TESTED AND IT IS

01:30:56.851 --> 01:31:00.087
NOT BAD AT THAT THERE WILL BE

01:31:00.154 --> 01:31:00.655
ANY SIGNIFICANT SAVINGS FROM

01:31:00.721 --> 01:31:04.458

01:31:07.728 --> 01:31:09.997
WIFE WANTED TO JUST CONTINUE

01:31:10.064 --> 01:31:12.867
OUR COMMENTS AND SAY WHY.

01:31:12.934 --> 01:31:15.603
CERTAINLY SO- WE'RE WORKING

01:31:15.670 --> 01:31:16.771
WITH THE DEPARTMENT FINANCE TO

01:31:16.838 --> 01:31:18.639

01:31:19.507 --> 01:31:21.142
OF TWENTY TWENTY AND THIS IS A

01:31:21.209 --> 01:31:23.311
AND THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUT

01:31:23.377 --> 01:31:25.079
THE TESTING WAS POSITIVE IN

01:31:25.146 --> 01:31:29.183
EARLY EARLY MARCH BUT THE

01:31:29.250 --> 01:31:30.918
PROCESS STILL CONTINUES ON. HOW

01:31:30.985 --> 01:31:32.687
TO UPDATE THOSE EXAMS AND

01:31:32.753 --> 01:31:33.487
PROVIDE THEM IN A VIRTUAL

01:31:33.554 --> 01:31:36.991
ENVIRONMENT. AND BOB CONTINUE

01:31:37.058 --> 01:31:38.659
FOR US TO FIND WAYS TO MAKE

01:31:38.726 --> 01:31:39.560
THOSE AVAILABLE TO STUDENTS

01:31:39.627 --> 01:31:42.730
AND- THE SAVINGS IS NOT AS

01:31:42.797 --> 01:31:43.231
SIGNIFICANT AS ONE MIGHT

01:31:43.297 --> 01:31:46.100
ANTICIPATE. OKAY THANK YOU-

01:31:46.167 --> 01:31:47.335
THIS WOULD BE THE TIME FOR ANY

01:31:47.401 --> 01:31:49.403
QUESTIONS FROM MANY MEMBERS-

01:31:49.470 --> 01:31:53.941

FOR A CENTER BERMAN YEAH- THANK

01:31:58.579 --> 01:32:01.315
YOU- I GUESS MY QUESTION IS

01:32:01.382 --> 01:32:03.217

01:32:03.284 --> 01:32:04.485
EDUCATIONAL COMMUNITY THAT FEEL

01:32:04.552 --> 01:32:07.655
LIKE. ASSESSMENTS HAVE LIMITED

01:32:07.722 --> 01:32:10.124
VALUE- WE KIND OF HAD A MASS

01:32:10.191 --> 01:32:12.860
EXPERIMENT- IN REDUCING THE

01:32:12.927 --> 01:32:14.428
SCALE AND SCOPE OF THESE

01:32:14.495 --> 01:32:16.764
ASSESSMENTS. I DO WE HAVE ANY

01:32:16.831 --> 01:32:17.832
DATA ACK YET THAT MIGHT

01:32:17.899 --> 01:32:20.434
SUGGEST- WHETHER THESE ARE AS

01:32:20.501 --> 01:32:22.303
EFFECTIVE AS THE TRADITIONAL

01:32:22.370 --> 01:32:26.374
ASSESSMENTS- WITH A FEWER HOURS

01:32:26.440 --> 01:32:26.941
PER STUDENT VIEW ACROSS THE

01:32:27.008 --> 01:32:31.979
STATE. I'M SORRY SENATOR CAN BE

01:32:32.046 --> 01:32:33.714

A LITTLE BIT MORE YEAH AND THIS

01:32:35.149 --> 01:32:36.550
MIGHT ACTUALLY BE FASTER MR

01:32:36.617 --> 01:32:38.386
ALLEN BUT- YOU KNOW WE

01:32:38.452 --> 01:32:40.254
BASICALLY HAD YOU KNOW A YEAR

01:32:40.321 --> 01:32:41.856
WHERE WE'VE BEEN RELY AND I

01:32:41.923 --> 01:32:43.624
REALIZE THAT THE DATA IS NOT

01:32:43.691 --> 01:32:44.492
ALL IN BECAUSE HE'S JUST

01:32:44.558 --> 01:32:46.294
MENTIONED. NOT ALL STUDENTS

01:32:46.360 --> 01:32:47.862
HAVE TAKEN THE TEST THE TESTING

01:32:47.929 --> 01:32:49.697
WINDOW STILL OPEN BUT I DO WE

01:32:49.764 --> 01:32:51.299
HAVE ANY SENSE OF WHETHER THE

01:32:51.365 --> 01:32:53.100
REDUCE TESTING IS AS EFFECTIVE

01:32:53.167 --> 01:32:57.438
IN ASSESSING STUDENTS. ARE ES

01:32:57.505 --> 01:32:59.874
THE TRADITIONAL ASSESSMENTS.

01:32:59.941 --> 01:33:01.742
BEFORE I DEFER TO MY COLLEAGUE

01:33:01.809 --> 01:33:03.244
AT THE STATE BOARD WE DON'T

01:33:03.311 --> 01:33:05.479
HAVE THAT DATA YET- TO BE ABLE

01:33:05.546 --> 01:33:06.914

FORM THAT WAS. ADOPTED WE DON'T

01:33:09.717 --> 01:33:11.485
HAVE THAT INFORMATION AND SO.

01:33:11.552 --> 01:33:12.820
WE CAN DO COMPARISON ONCE WE

01:33:12.887 --> 01:33:14.255
HAVE THE DATA BUT AGAIN BECAUSE

01:33:14.322 --> 01:33:15.890
THE WINDOW IS EXTENDED AND WE

01:33:15.957 --> 01:33:16.958
HAVE A LONGER TIME PERIOD WE'RE

01:33:17.024 --> 01:33:18.426

IS. SOMETHING THAT WE DO SEE IS

01:33:31.973 --> 01:33:34.008

SENATOR LARRY I THINK THAT IS A

01:52:51.965 --> 01:52:53.900
