WILL GO AHEAD AND GET STARTED BOOK CALLED THE. HUMAN SERVICES COMMITTEE. MEANING STARTED AT ONE FORTY. CAN. YES WERE STARTING OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE. SO WELCOME TO THE APRIL TWENTY FOURTH HEARING OF THE ASSEMBLY HUMAN SERVICES COMMITTEE TODAY WE HAVE TWENTY TWO BILLS UP. SEVEN OF WHICH ARE IN CONSENT PLEASE NOT THAT ITEM NUMBER TWENTY TWO A. B. THIRTY ONE SIXTY ONE HAS BEEN PULLED FROM THE AGENDA BY THE AUTHOR. WE ARE ALLOWED TO MAKE TO WITNESSES A SUPPORT INTO IN THIS IS AN OPPOSITION FOR EACH BILL. EACH OF THESE WITNESSES SHOULD LIMIT THEIR TESTIMONY TO TWO MINUTES. ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES MAY ADD ON THEIR SUPPORT OR OPPOSITION BY STATING ONLY THEIR NAME AND ORGANIZATION. GIVEN THE LENGTH OF TODAY'S AGENDA WE ASK THAT YOU PLEASE UNDER THESE TIME LIMITS OUT OF RESPECT FOR EVERYONE WHO IS HERE TO TESTIFY TODAY. IT'S GOING TO BE A REALLY CRAZY MEETING YOU'LL BE. WILL HAVE AUTHORS IN THE NOW AND SO WE HAVE TO BE REALLY FLEXIBLE TODAY. I'M AS A COURTESY TO MISTER STONE AND HIS WITNESS SAYS I WILL BE ALLOWING HIM TO PRESENT OUT OF ORDER TODAY BY GOING FIRST. I. THANK YOU MISTER STONE FOR BEING HERE YOU MAY GO AHEAD AND BEGIN. I ITEM NUMBER SEVENTEEN AB THREE ZERO ZERO SIX. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND IT'S MY WITNESSES COME UP I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE FLEXIBILITY. UNFORTUNATELY OUR HEARING ROOMS THAT ARE PROCESSES ARE NOT REALLY SET UP. TO. HAVE THE PARTICIPATION OF THE DEATH IN THE HARD OF HEARING AND SO THAT SPECIAL ORDERS REALLY TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE AN INTERPRETER HERE. BECAUSE THIS BILL IS ABOUT DEAFENED AND HARD OF HEARING INDIVIDUALS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. AS WE KNOW UNDER STATE LAW AND FEDERAL LAW. THAT THEY HAVE. BENEFITS AND RIGHTS OF ACCESS WHICH IS VERY VERY APPROPRIATE. BUT WITHIN OUR. HUMAN SERVICES ARENAS ACROSS THAT THE DIFFERENT COUNTIES. DOES THOSE RIGHTS ARE NOT ALWAYS VERY WELL RESPECTED AND WE'VE BEEN WORKING HARD THE LEGISLATURE TO ENSURE. LANGUAGE ACCESS TO ENSURE ACCESS BY EVERYONE AND WE SEEM TO NOT ALWAYS REMEMBER THAT DEAF AND HARD OF HEARING. SO WHAT AB THREE ZERO ZERO SIX WOULD REQUIRE IS A DEAF AND HARD OF HEARING COORDINATOR. IN EACH COUNTY AND A STATEWIDE COORDINATOR STATEWIDE MANAGER TO ENSURE THAT EVERY. COUNTY ORGANIZATION OR THAT THEY. THAT HUMAN SERVICES FUNCTIONS. ACROSS THE STATE ARE MEETING THE NEEDS OF THE DEAF AND HARD OF HEARING AND THIS IS REALLY A CUE WHEN IN. VERY DRAMATIC SITUATIONS. ONE MORE SOMEBODY'S POTENTIALLY HAVING A CHILD REMOVED FROM THE HOUSE AND A. AND A SOCIAL WORKER COMES. SHERIFF COME THAT OTHERS COME TO TALK TO THAT FAMILY AND AND ASSESS THE SITUATION IF THE THE PARENTS OR EVEN A CHILD IS DEFORE HARD OF HEARING. IT'S NOT EASY TO COMMUNICATE WITH THEM THEY MAY NOT BE ABLE TO STAND UP FOR THEMSELVES REPRESENT THEMSELVES OR GIVE. THE COUNTY WORKERS THAN AN ACCURATE PICTURE OF WHAT'S HAPPENING AND THAT COULD DEFINITELY PREJUDICES SITUATION MERELY BECAUSE OF A LACK OF COMMUNICATION. THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL IS ABOUT. IS ENSURING THAT THAT DEAF AND HARD OF HEARING THAT EACH COUNTY HAS PROCESS IS IN PLACE. INSURES THAT BE THEY'RE DEAF HARD OF HEARING CAN BE ACCOMMODATED IN WHATEVER OF THE THE FUNCTIONS ARE IN THEIR SOCIAL SERVICES RUN. I DO HAVE SOME WITNESSES IN SPORT AND I ASK FOR YOUR AYE THEM. THANK YOU BEFORE WE BEGIN WITH THE TESTIMONY AND I WOULD LIKE TO ESTABLISH CRIME. CAN CULTURAL. ARE. RUBIO. ARE HERE. DOCTOR CHOI HERE. ARAMBULA. MAIENSCHEIN. THERE'S. STONE HERE. THURMOND. WE HAVE ACQUIRED AND YOU CAN. EVELYN UP HASN'T WITH DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA WE ARE THE SPONSORS OF THE BILL WE THINK IT'S CRITICAL I'M A QUICKLY IMPORTANT BILL. WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON WITH STAKEHOLDERS TO ADDRESS QUESTIONS ABOUT THE BILL WOULD LIKE TO DO. IS DID FOR MY TIME OVER TO OUR TECHNICAL WITNESS ON DEBRA CATTLEMEN FROM OUR OFFICE WHO'S BEEN WORKING WITH US TO DRAFT LANGUAGE AND. ADDRESS ANY QUESTIONS WITH THE LEGISLATION. I'M THINK US EVELYN MENTION MY NAME IS DEBORAH GELMAN I'M A SUPERVISING ATTORNEY IN OUR OAKLAND OFFICE. HOME I WANT TO START BY THANKING THE AUTHOR I'M ASSEMBLY MEMBER STONE AND ON THE COMMITTEE FOR AN OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY TODAY. THE ISSUE THAT I'M FOR TRYING TO ADDRESSIN THIS BILL CAME TO MY ATTENTION SEVERAL YEARS AGO. WHEN WE HAD SEVERAL DEAF CONSUMERS CONTACT ARE IN DECLINE WITH COMPLAINTS ABOUT AND FEARS OF LOSING THEIR CHILDREN BECAUSE THEY WEREN'T BEING. EQUALLY EFFECTIVELY ACCOMMODATED IN THEIR INTERACTIONS WITH CPS FOR EXAMPLE WE HAD A CLIENT TO ON WAS IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY AND WAS REQUIRED TO GO TO PARENTING CLASSES THE PARENTING CLASS ISSUE WAS REFERRED TO. REFUSE TO PROVIDE AN INTERPRETER THE COUNTY REFUSED TO STEP IN AS WELL THE PARENTS ENDED UP SITTING THROUGH PARENTING CLASSES I'M NOT ABLE TO UNDERSTAND IT ALL WAS HAPPENING BUT KNEW THAT IT WAS A MANDATE AND DID IT ANYWAY. SO AS NOT TO RISK. REUNIFICATION. IN ADDITION. WE HAVE HAD CLIENTS ON. INFORM US THAT THERE IT WAS ACKNOWLEDGED IN THEIR FILE THAT THERE WAS NO QUOTE NO LANGUAGE SPOKEN IN THE HOME. ON ONLY BECAUSE THEY SIGNED AND THAT THERE WAS NO VERBAL COMMUNICATION WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY PROBLEMATIC. ON A SL IS IT IS A ROBUST LANGUAGE PALM AND THEN FINALLY. PARENTS TELLING US THAT WHEN THE TIME COUNTY CASEWORKERS WERE COMING OBSERVE THEIR INTERACTIONS WITH THEIR CHILDREN THEY WOULDN'T BRING INTERPRETERS ON NO IDEA WHAT WAS GOING ON BETWEEN PARENT AND CHILD. AND ON AND NO IDEA OF DEAF CULTURE IN THE IMPORTANCE OF KIND OF I'M JUST JUST ICKY LEADING AND ALSO FACIAL FEATURES AND JUST KIND OF ON INFERRING THINGS THAT MIGHT BE VERY INACCURATE FROM THAT INTERACTION. THIS ISSUE ABOUT ON LACK OF ACCOMMODATIONS WITH SIDE TELL PROTECTIVE SERVICES IS WELL KNOWN IN THE DEAF COMMUNITY THIS IS SOMETHING THAT THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF THE DEATH. WHICH IS THE PRE EMINENT NAM CIVIL RIGHTS LEGAL AGENCY AND THE UNITED STATES ON OF BY AND FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE DEAF. HOW THEY'VE WRITTEN A POSITION STATEMENT ON THE S. AND? ON THE POSITION STATEMENT I'VE REFERS KIND OF EVERYONE IN THE COUNTRY TO LOOK AT THE. L. A.. THE LA COUNTY DEPT SERVICES UNIT FOR A MODEL AND SO WE'RE LOOKING CALIFORNIA WE HAVE THIS BEAUTIFUL MODEL IN LA. THEY HAVE A SPECIAL UNIT THAT IS SPECIFICALLY FOR FAMILIES WHO ARE DEAF ON THEY HAVE FIVE TO SEVEN CASE WORKERS WHO ARE FLUENT IN SIGN. ON PEOPLE DEATH FAMILIES WHO COME THROUGH THE SYSTEM OUR SIDE SPECIFICALLY TO THOSE CASE WORKERS. AND SO WE TRY TO DO THAT WITH THIS BILL. I'M ALSO THE ISSUE OF ACCOMMODATING PARENTS WITH DISABILITIES WAS INVESTIGATED BY THE US DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AND THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. AND IN TWO THOUSAND AND SIXTEEN THEY ARE WHO THEY AUTHORED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE ON THE IMPORTANCE OF ACCOMMODATING ON PARENTS WITH DISABILITIES IN PARTICULAR DEAF PARENTS. ON THAT IS ON A THAT'S A WONDERFUL REPORTS AND THAT THE GOAL WAS. TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE TO LOCAL CHILD WELFARE AGENCIES AND COURTS ON WHAT NEEDS TO BE ACCOMMODATED PARKS HIS ME HOW BEST TO ACCOMMODATE. SO AS ASSEMBLY ON. A PERSON STONE MENTIONED THAT THE LIES REALLY CLEAR THE LAST BEEN AROUND FOR AWHILE ON BUT UNFORTUNATELY SOMETIMES THE LIES AND IMPLEMENTED THE WAY THAT IT SHOULD. SO WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS AHMED HOPES TO ADDRESS AND OF OVERSIGHT ON ENSURING PEOPLE DON'T FALL THROUGH THE CRACKS THAT WHEN THEY'RE COMMENTED THERE COMMENTED. ON NOT JUST THE FIRST TIME THAT THEY INTERACT WITH THE DEPARTMENT BUT THERE COMMENTED IT EVERY SINGLE TIME. THAT THERE IS SOMEONE WHO THERE'S CONSISTENCY AND WHO THEY'RE INTERACTING WITH. THERE'S ADEQUATE TRAINING ON DEAF CULTURE AND OPTIONS FOR ACCOMMODATIONS. AND. AND ALSO THAT THEY'RE COMMUNICATING WITH SOMEONE WHO EITHER IS FLUENT IN SIGN THEMSELVES OR IS IS YOU KNOW ACKNOWLEDGES THEY NEED TO BRING OUT AN INTERPRETER. AND SO COMMUNICATION REMAINS EQUAL AND EFFECTIVE. THANK YOU ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. GOOD AFTERNOON. THE CALIFORNIA FOUNDATION FOR INDEPENDENT LIVING CENTERS WE ARE IN STRONG SUPPORT. GOOD AFTERNOON I'M JEALOUS I SERVE ON CALIFORNIA STATE COUNCIL ON DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES AND THE STATE COUNCILS IN SUPPORT THANK YOU THANK YOU. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS KATHY SANDERLING FROM THE COUNTY WELFARE DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION WE CLEARLY HAVE A SUPPORTING CONCEPT ON THE LEGISLATION WE ONE HUNDRED PERCENT AGREE. THAT ENSURING THAT THE ACCOMMODATIONS AND ACCESS OR THERE IS CRITICAL HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH THE SPONSORS ACTIVE WE ON A FEW AMENDMENTS TO MAKE IT WORK TECHNICALLY ON THE GROUND. I'M CONFIDENT WE'LL GET THERE. IT HAVE NO ISSUES AT ALL WITH THE BILL MOVING FORWARD AND LOOKING FORWARD TO BEING ABLE TO COME ON AND IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU. YEAH ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. OKAY. THING THEN CAUGHT QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. UP TO TRY. THANK YOU I HAVE. SOME ANALYSES TO HEAR IS SAYS SO. LOVE THIS SERVICES ARE ALREADY OUT EXISTING IS OUR LACK OF OUR COMMUNICATION Y. MIS UNDERSTANDING TO TO THEIR LACK OF A PROPER O. INTERPRETERS SO AND THE LANGUAGE OF PROVIDERS SAID HAS BEEN DEEMED THE. DISCRIMINATORY. BY BOTH THE STATE AND THE FEDERAL LAWS. AND THIS. THERE IS ALREADY OUT THERE ACCESS A PROGRAM WITH INDEED. DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES AND THEN AVAILABLE FOR LOCAL COUNTY AGENCIES SO TO YOU IS A LIE SO HOW DO YOU ANSWER TO THIS OUR OUR WHY WHY YOU APPEAR THIS UNNECESSARY IF FOR. A SERVICES IS ALREADY AVAILABLE. BECAUSE IT'S NOT REALLY. AVAILABLE AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE COUNTIES ACROSS CALIFORNIA THE SERVICES ARE NOT BEING PROVIDED. IMAGINE. WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON THAT SOCIAL WORKER GOES INTO A HOME WITH THE POTENTIAL OF REMOVING A CHILD. AND THAT FAMILY ONLY SPEAKS SPANISH ONLY SPEAKS TO DOLLARS ONLY SPEAKS RUSSIAN ONLY SPEAKS CHINESE. AND THE SOCIAL WORKER THEN DECIDES THAT BECAUSE THEY CAN'T UNDERSTAND DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON. THEY MAY REMOVE THAT CHILD. SAME SAME CIRCUMSTANCE HERE WE PROVIDE TRAINING WE PROVIDE. CULTURAL COMPETENCY WE PROVIDE LANGUAGE PROVISIONS BUT NOT FOR THE DEAF AND HARD OF HEARING. ASL IS A LANGUAGE THAT NO HARD OF HEARING DO IN FACT COMMUNICATE WHETHER IT'S PARENTS OR OR CHILDREN. AND IN ACROSS THE COUNTIES. THESE SERVICES DON'T ALWAYS EXIST TO TRAINING START ALWAYS THERE THE PROTOCOLS ARE NOT ALWAYS THERE WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS ENSURE THAT IN EVERY SINGLE COUNTY. THERE IS A DEFINITE HARD OF HEARING COORDINATOR TO ENSURE THAT THOSE SERVICES HAPPENED AND THAT AT THE STATE LEVEL PROVIDING TRAINING. MATERIALS. RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE COUNTIES TO ENSURE THAT THAT CAPACITY EXISTS IN EVERY SINGLE COUNTY. I THINK GOES HOW MINIMUM I'M NOT REALLY FAMILIAR IN THIS AREA I DO A DIFFERENT NOT SIGN LANGUAGES UP BASED UPON THE ORIGIN OF THE. LANGUAGE APPLY DIFFERENT. A CULTURE ENGLISH SO HAVE RUSSIAN FOREIGN JAPANESE THERE ARE THERE TEND TO BE DIFFERENT. INTERPRETATIONS ARE DEVELOPED DIFFERENT IMPLEMENTATIONS OF OF SIGN LANGUAGE. I DON'T KNOW HOW ACUTE THE ISSUE IS WITH SIGN LANGUAGE WITH A. SPANISH SPEAKING FAMILY RUSSIAN SPEAKING FAMILY BUT I'M TALKING ABOUT SPOKEN LANGUAGE. WE'RE FAMILIAR WITH THAT WE GO SOLVE THAT BUT WHEN A FAMILIES USING ASL AMERICAN SIGN LANGUAGE. AND A SOCIAL WORKER COMES A SHERIFF'S DEPUTY COMES THERE THERE'S AN INTERACTION WITH THE COUNTY SOCIAL SERVICES AND NOBODY'S TRAINED IN AMERICAN SIGN LANGUAGE. THEY'RE NOT SENSITIVE TO THE ISSUES OF A FAMILY THAT IS USING AMERICAN SIGN LANGUAGE OR COMMUNICATING BECAUSE ONE OR MORE THE FAMILY MEMBERS THAT WHAT WE DON'T WANT IS FOR THEM TO COME TO A CONCLUSION THAT JUST MERELY BECAUSE. THEY'RE COMMUNICATING IN A DIFFERENT FORMAT. THAT THERE IS A PROBLEM THERE. SO YOU BEER OR CREATE ON THE MANAGER. DEAF SERVICES THE MANAGER AND THEN ALSO EVERY COUNTY POSITION ONE HAVE A DEAF AND HARD TO HEARING COORDINATOR. AND THE DISTAL MANAGES AND COORDINATOR SO WHERE SOLVE ALL THE PROBLEMS AT THAT GOT UP ABOUT. IT WILL GO ALONG WAY TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEMS YES AND IN AND INCREASE THE AMUNT OF KNOWLEDGE AND CAPACITY WITHIN EACH COUNTY. TO ADDRESS THE DEATH AND ART OF HERE'S TAM IS THAT IT HAS NOT WILL NOT BE THE REDUNDANT SERVICE. OKAY OUR HEAR FROM THE OPPOSITION SIDE MATTHEW. LARA THANK YOU THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. AYE THE MOTION BY. ASSEMBLYMEMBER REYES AND UGLY AND SECOND THAT MOTION THANK YOU CAN YOU CALL THE ROLL PLEASE. I'M SORRY JOIN A CLOSE. I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU. RUBIO. REVEAL AYE DOCTOR CHOI. OKAY HER GO WITH I DON'T KNOW I ARAMBULA. MAIENSCHEIN. REYES. STONE BY STONE AYE THURMOND. THREE VOTE NEED TO ONE MORE. THAT BILL IS ON CALL AND IT'S. DO PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS. TAKING CARE. IS ASSEMBLY MEMBER QUIRK CARE. NO QUE OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER KALRA THINK INMIGRANTES COMMENT THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY FOUR FIFTY FIVE ALLOWS THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES TO PROVIDE UPON. REQUEST WILL LABOR ORGANIZATION A RECORD OF ALL THE NAMES THE NAMES AND PHONE NUMBERS OF NEWLY REGISTERED OR RE REGISTERING HOME CARE AIDES. THE BILL PROHIBIT A LABOR ORGANIZATION FROM SHARING AREUSING THIS INFORMATION FOR ANY PURPOSE OTHER THAN TO PLAY TRAINING ORGANIZING REPRESENTATION. AND ASSISTANCE. THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY ONE HUNDRED FORTY FIVE THOUSAND PRIVATE HOME CARE AIDES IN CALIFORNIA. THESE PERSONAL CARE PROVIDERS ARE PRIMARILY EMPLOYED BY LARGE COMPANIES THAT THE PLAY HOME CARE AIDES TO THE ELDERLY. CONVALESCENCE OR PERSONAL DISABILITIES WHO NEED ASSISTANCE WITH ACTIVITIES OR DAILY LIVING SUCH AS HOUSEKEEPING. MEAL PREPARATION OTHER PERSONAL CARE SERVICES. THE WORKFORCE IS COMPOSED OF PRIMARILY WOMEN AND PEOPLE OF COLOR AND THE WORK IS OFTEN ISOLATED AND AT TIMES UNSAFE. IN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN THE HOME CARE SERVICES CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT REQUIRE DSS TO LICENSE PRIVATE COMPANIES THAT PROVIDE PRIVATE PAY. HOME CARE SERVICES TO CALIFORNIA'S ELDERLY AND DISABLED POPULATION AS WELL AS CERTIFIED INDIVIDUAL HOME CARE AIDES WERE EMPLOYED BY THESE COMPANIES. DSS RESPONSIBLE FOR COMPILING AND MAINTAINING A REGISTRY OF HOME CARE AGENCIES AND AIDS ON ITS INTERNET WEBSITE. CURRENTLY SOMEONE VISITING THE HOME CARE A REGISTRY IS ONLY ABLE TO VERIFY WHETHER OR NOT A HOMECARE AIDE IS REGISTERED WANTS A FULL NAME AND THE PROVIDERS PERSON OF PERSONNEL. IDENTIFICATION NUMBER ENTERED THIS ASSUMES A CONSUMER HAS OBTAINED THIS INFORMATION TO THE COMPANY WHICH IS NOT ALWAYS THE CASE. WITHOUT A REAL WAY FOR LABOR ORGANIZATION'S OUTREACH TO HOME CARE IS TO OFFER TRAINING REPRESENTATION. THE LONG TERM CARE WORKFORCE COULD BE STUNTED A TIME WHEN THERE'S A GROWING POPULATION OF SENIORS. AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES IN CALIFORNIA. LAST YEAR I AUTHORED AB FIFTY THIRTEEN WHICH WAS VETOED BY THE GOVERNOR BECAUSE OF THE CONCERN. THAT HOME CARE AIDES ENTERING THE SYSTEM WERE NOT AWARE THAT THE INFORMATION WOULD EVENTUALLY YOU DISCLOSE LABOR ORGANIZATIONS. HAVE ADDRESSED THOSE CONCERNS BY MAKING AB TWENTY FOURTH FIVE AT PROACTIVE PROSPECTIVE MEASURE. THAT NOTIFIES THE NEWLY REGISTERED OR RE REGISTERING HOME CARE AIDES TO THE REGISTRIES AVAILABLE TO LABOR ORGANIZATIONS. I AM HAPPY TO ACCEPT THE COMMITTEES. I'M HAPPY TO ACCEPT THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS THAT ADD TO THE FACTS OF BINDING SECTION AND REPLICATE AGREED UPON LANGUAGE OF LAST YEAR'S AB FIFTEEN THIRTEEN. REGARDING THE WRITTEN NOTICE TO HOME CARE AIDES ABOUT THE NEW DISCLOSURE. AB TWENTY FOUR FIFTY FIVE GRANTS HOME CARE IS OPPORTUNITY TO BENEFIT FROM TRAINING AND ORGANIZING THAT MAY NOT BE READILY AVAILABLE TO THEM. THESE SERVICES CAN HELP HOME CARE AIDES ADVANCE THEIR CAREERS. INCREASE THE LEVEL OF CARE THEY PROVIDE AND EARN INVALUABLE OPPORTUNITY THAT THE STATE SHOULD TAKE ADVANTAGE OF AS OUR AGING POPULATION CONTINUES TO INCREASE. WITH ME TO PROVIDE SUPPORTING TESTS MY OUR TIFFANY WOULDN'T FROM SEIU CALIFORNIA. AND DANIELLE DAVIS A PRIVATE HOME CARE WORKERS. THANK YOU BYE. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS TIFFANY RIGHT NOW WITH THE SERVICE EMPLOYEES INTERNATIONAL UNION REPRESENTING OVER THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND LONG TERM CARE WORKERS WHO LIKE TO THINK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THE BILL FOR IT. ON THE FOR YOUR COMMITTEE FOR WORKING WITH US ON THE AMENDMENTS I'M THAT WERE LAID OUT AND SAID THAT ANALYSIS I JUST WANTED TO ECHO IN NOTE I'M REALLY QUICKLY THE CHANGES THAT WERE MADE FROM LECTURES VERSION THAT YOU GUYS THOUGHT. TO THIS YEAR'S VERSION IT ONLY AFFECTS THOSE. INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE NEWLY REGISTERED OR WHEN THEY GO TO RENEW THEIR REGISTRATION EVERY TWO YEARS. SO WE LOOKED INTO THE VETO MESSAGE AND MAKE SURE THAT WE MADE. THE PROPER CHANGES TO AND SO WITH ME TODAY I HAVE DANIELLE ONE OF OUR. MEMBERS THAT CAN SPEAK FROM THE CARE GIVERS PERSPECTIVE. THANK YOU. HOW LOW CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS DANIEL DAVIS FROM SAN FRANCISCO CALIFORNIA AND I HAVE BEEN A PRIVATE AGENCY HOMECARE PROVIDER FOR OVER THIRTEEN YEARS WITH THE INSTITUTE OF AGING? I LOVE MY JOB EVERY DAY I HAVE GREAT OPPORTUNITIES TO GIVE LOVE COMPASSION AND SERVICES THAT HELP PEOPLE LIVE A MORE INDEPENDENT LIFE BECAUSE. I HELP THOSE WHO CANNOT FULLY HELP THEMSELVES. THOUGH MY WORK CAN BE CHALLENGING SOMETIMES I JUST FOCUS ON PROVIDING THE BEST CARE THAT I CAN AND ALWAYS REMEMBER THAT THE PATIENTS APPRECIATE MY WORK. THEY ARE MORE LIKE FAMILY TO ME THAN JUST PATIENTS. I'M ALSO. EXCUSE ME I AM ALSO ABLE TO FOCUS ON THE CARE I GIVE TO CLIENTS BECAUSE OF THE SUPPORT I HAVE FROM MY UNION. SINCE I BEGAN MY CAREER WITH THE INSTITUTE ON AGING I HAVE PASSED THE SUPPORT I NEED FOR MY UNION BUT NOT ALL CARE GIVERS ARE AS LUCKY AS ME. BUT WE ALL ARE ONE AND WE ALL DO THE SAME JOB AS THE SHOP STEWARD I TAKE WHAT I DO AND THE CARE I PROVIDE VERY SERIOUSLY. I ADHERE TO MY OWN STRICT STANDARDS TO KEEP MY CLIENTS AND MYSELF SAY. STANDARDS THAT I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO LEARN AND TEACH OTHERS BECAUSE I AM CONNECTED WITH MY CO WORKERS AND HAVE AN EMPLOYEE REPRESENTATIVE THAT I CONTRAST. I SUPPORT ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY FOUR FIFTY FIVE BECAUSE THE IDEA OF ALLOWING SPECIFIC LABOR ORGANIZATIONS TO REACH OUT TO CARE GIVERS LIKE NEED. TO HELP THEM BECOME A BETTER CAREGIVER WITH THE RESOURCES THAT MAY NOT BE PROVIDED OTHERWISE. THAT MAY NOT BE OTHERWISE KNOWN TO THEM SKEWS WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN PLACED IN YEARS AGO. ON BEHALF OF PRIVATE AGENCY HOME AIDS AND THE PEOPLE WE CARE FOR WE SUPPORT ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY FOUR FIFTY FIVE AND RESPECTFULLY ACTS FOR YOUR SUPPORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. GOOD AFTERNOON SHE BONDED AMONG BECAUSE WITH UT W. OFFICE ME LOCAL THIRTY NINE THIRTY IN VERY STRONG SUPPORT. OKAY. AB WHEN THIS IS IN OPPOSITION. THIS DOES. HELLO MY NAME IS APRIL CARNEY I'M WITH APEX CARE AND HOME CARE SERVICES I AM STRONG OPPOSITION THANK YOU. THANK YOU. LET ME AMEND JERRY MEMBERS BRAVE NEBRASKA MAP THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION HEALTH SERVICES AT HOME. WE ARE OPPOSED TO THE BILL. OFFER SMALL. WE APPRECIATE THE AMENDMENTS THAT WERE PROPOSED. DOESN'T CHANGE UNFORTUNATELY DOESN'T CHANGE OUR POSITION ON THE BILL. WELL FIRST OF ALL I'M GONNA START BY SAYING THAT COST IS NOT AGAINST UNIONS WE HAVE NOTHING AGAINST UNIONS WE HAVE NOTHING AGAINST OUR HOME CARE WORKERS JOINING THE UNION. WHAT WE DO OBJECT TO THOUGH IS THE STATE? DOING WHAT THE UNIONS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO THE UNITS HAVE BEEN TRYING TO ORGANIZE HOME CARE ALL WORKERS FOR YEARS THEY HAVE BEEN THEM TO DO IT IN THIS BILL IS TRYING TO HAVE THE STATE DO IT FOR THEM. YOU JUST HEARD SAYING THAT THIS IS THE ONLY WAY TO GET INFORMATION OUT TO HOME CARE WORKERS THAT ISN'T THE CASE. YOU CAN DO NEWSPAPER ADS YOU CAN DO MAGAZINE ADS YOU CAN DO INTERNET. YOU CAN GO ON TO THE REGISTRY AND GET THE NAMES. AND ADDRESSES BY COUNTY OF HOME COURT OR ORGANIZATIONS. AND VISIT THEM THERE LOTS OF WAYS TO REACH OUT TO HOME CARE WORKERS WITHOUT GETTING PERSONAL NAMES PERSONAL PHONE NUMBERS AND CELL PHONE NUMBERS OF THE STATE'S. THIS BILL IS NOT ABOUT I JUST US WORKERS THIS BILL IS NOT ABOUT INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS WORKING FOR DR RACE THIS BILL IS ABOUT REGISTERED HOME CARE AIDES WORKING FOR REGISTERED HOME CARRIED COMPANIES. HOME CARE ORGANIZATIONS HAD TO BE REGISTERED STARTING TWO YEARS AGO THEY'RE JUST GOING TO THEIR RENEWAL PROCESS NOW. BECAUSE ACTUALLY SUPPORTED LICENSURE WE ACTUALLY PROPOSED LICENSE YOUR BILL OURSELVES WORKED WITH VARIOUS ENTITIES BECAUSE WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL OF OUR HOMECARE ORGANIZATIONS. AND A HOME CARE AIDES OF WORKING OFF THE SAME CRITERIA. WE DEMANDED AS PART OF LICENSURE THAT TRAINING BE PUT INTO LICENSURE REQUIREMENTS HOME CARE AIDES HAVE TO MEET THE MINIMUM STANDARDS OF TRAINING. EVERY YEAR. THAT TRAINING MUST BE DETAILED BY THE TYPE OF TRAINING. WHAT WAS COVERED IN THE TRAINING THE NAME OF THE COURSE AND THE INSTRUCTOR THAT WAS GIVEN THE COURSE? EVERY TWO YEARS THE DEPARTMENT COMES OUT AND REVIEWS HOMECARE ORGANIZATIONS. THEY LOOK AT THAT TRAINING FOR EVERY SINGLE AID THAT THE COMPOUND SEE. IF THAT TRAINING IS NOT THERE THE HOMECARE ORGANIZATIONS FACE A FINE OF UP TO NINE HUNDRED DOLLARS PER DAY PER VIOLATION. THAT'S NO SMALL AMOUNT OF MONEY. THAT COULD QUICKLY PUT HOME CARE ORGANIZATION OUT OF BUSINESS IF THEY'RE NOT IN COMPLIANCE. WE TAKE TRAINING VERY SERIOUSLY AND TO SAY THAT HOME CARE AIDES ARE NOT GIVING TRAINING CRAP FRATERNITIES IS SIMPLY FALSE. ADDITIONALLY. WHAT IS THIS BILL DOING ITS PROVIDING FOR ONE GROUP OF PEOPLE? PRO UNION FOLKS TO GET ACCESS TO INFORMATION TO PROVIDE SPEECH. WHERE ANOTHER GROUP FOR EXAMPLE AND ANTI UNION ORGANIZATION DOES NOT GIVE THAT SAME INFORMATION TO PROMOTE THEIR OWN SPEECH? IF THIS INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE TO A PUBLIC INFORMATION REQUEST IT SHOULD BE MADE AVAILABLE TO BOTH SIDES NOT JUST ONE SIDE WITH THAT WE ASK FOR AN OF. AND CHAIR MEMBERS THAT CARL LONDON HERE ABOUT THE HOME CARE ASSOCIATION OF AMERICA WE ALSO REPRESENT. NUMBER OF PRIVATE BUSINESSES THAT PROVIDE HOME CARE SERVICES THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE AGREE. WITH THE OF PRIOR TESTIMONY THE PRINCES OF THIS BILL ARE JUST FALLS. THIS BILL IS PURE AND SIMPLE. ABOUT NOTHING MORE THAN ORGANIZING IN HANDING OVER TO ORGANIZED LABOR THE TOOLS TO HAVE ALL OF THE NAMES AND PHONE NUMBERS OF THE PEOPLE THAT ARE ON THE REGISTRY REGISTERED IN CALIFORNIA. TO GIVE THEIR PRIVATE CONTACT INFORMATION OF THEM AWAITED THEM AT PURE AND SIMPLE THAT'S THE NUMBER ONE REASON FOR THE BILL. TRAINING ABSOLUTELY FALSE AS A BRAIN INDICATED BE TRAINING. THAT ARE ORGANIZATIONS PROVIDE IS REQUIRED BOTH UNDER LAW IT'S AN FOR QUALITY PURPOSES MINUTES ALSO DON'T FOR LIABILITY REASONS THERE'S NO WAY. AN ORGANIZATION WOULD SEND A STAFF PERSON OUT WITHOUT ADEQUATE TRAINING FOR FEAR OF LIABILITY IMPROV'S THAT WOULD ARISE FROM THAT. LAST YEAR I ALSO WANT TO POINT OUT THAT WE HAD VICTIMS. DOMESTIC VIOLENCE VICTIMS WHO TESTIFIED IN OPPOSITION THIS BILL THEY'RE VERY AFRAID OF HAVING THEIR INFORMATION CIRCULATING ANYWHERE. THEY DID NOT WANT TO SEE IT CIRCULATING IN A WHERE WE WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE OPT OUT WAS GIVEN AS A CHOICE BUT AT MINIMUM. AND THE WOMEN THAT TESTIFIED WERE ASKING FOR AN OPT IN THIS BILL DOESN'T DO THAT. THAT SAID THAT WOULDN'T SATISFY ORGANIZATION WE SEE NO COMPELLING REASON TO DO THIS. THE OTHER THING THE BILL PROVIDES ABSOLUTELY. NO LIMITATIONS WHATSOEVER ON THE TYPES OF CALLS THE NUMBERS OF CONTACTS THAT CAN BE MADE TO PERSONS ONCE INFORMATION IS GIVEN AWAY. THEY COULD BE REPEATEDLY HARASSED CONTACTED OVER OVER AGAIN THERE'S NOTHING IN THE BILL. THAT RESTRICTS THAT IN ANY WAY. FINALLY LOOKING AT A OTHER EXAMPLES. IT'S IT'S ABSOLUTELY TRUE THAT OTHER STATES THERE HAVE BEEN EFFORTS TO TRY TO ON ORGANIZE WORKERS. WHEN THOSE TYPES OF LEGISLATIVE EFFORTS HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED. GUESS WHO OPPOSES THOSE LABOR UNIONS THEY DO NOT WANT TO SEE YOU EQUAL INFORMATION PROVIDED TO THE PEOPLE THAT THEY WORK WITH. LAST THING ITS IN THIS IS COMPARE THIS TO. ANY OTHER PERSON REGISTERED WITH THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FOR EXAMPLE YOUR PHYSICIAN YOUR DENTIST. A ANY PERSON WAS A LICENSE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. YOU'RE NOT NO PERSON IS ABLE TO CONTACTED THAT LICENSING BOARD AND ASK FOR YOUR DOCTORS HOME PHONE NUMBER AND CONTACT INFORMATION. IF THEY CHOSE TO GIVE IT TO THAT'S FINE YOU COULD GET IT BUT THERE IS NO OTHER STATE PRECEDENT FOR THIS WERE GIVING AWAY INFORMATION TO A SINGLE. POPULATION OF PEOPLE JUST FOR THE PURPOSE OF ORGANIZING AND AND THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL IS ALL ABOUT WE ABSOLUTELY OPPOSE THIS WEEK URGING NO VOTE ON THIS BILL. AND. HAPPEN ANSWERING QUESTIONS YOU HAVE. THANK YOU ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. THEM. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE RAINY POLLOCK IN BEHALF OF HOME INSTEAD IN OPPOSITION. ALLAN FISHER IN STRONG OPPOSITION HONOR OF INTO CARE IN HOME CARE. KAREN KAUFMAN. OWNER OF INTO CARE IN STRONG OPPOSITION. FAIRLY NARROW FOR THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE IN OPPOSITION. AHMED CHAIR KEVIN PROUTY REPRESENTING MAXIM. HEALTH CARE SERVICES IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU. OKAY. THINK YOU. WITH THAT AYE ACTION THERE'S NOT OKAY. YES. WHO? WHO? I'M. NICOLE BARS AUG IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU ANY COMMUNITY RELATIONS MANAGER WITH APEX CARE AND CARE AND STRONG OPPOSITION. THANK YOU. PAGE EIGHTEEN CALIFORNIA DISABILITY SERVICES ASSOCIATION IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU. CAPE MEN CHAIR IF I MAY JUST ADD ONE MORE WITH A SECOND KLEIN AMONG A TESTIFIED JUST IDENTIFY THEM BUT. THE ALLIANCE SUPPORTING A INDIVIDUALS WITH INTELLECTUAL DEVELOPMENT THIS BILL IS IS ALSO OPPOSED TO THIS LEGISLATION. THANK YOU. OKAY WITH THAT. UP UP TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS. DOCTOR TRIED. I HEAR VERY CLEARLY THAT OF THIS SYSTEM NOT TEMPT TO ARE NOT ORGANIZE OUR IN HOME CARE. SERVICE OF PROVIDERS SO. IT MAY BE GOOD STUFF ARM. AND FOR THE. UNIONS TO ORGANIZE. FOR WHATEVER CLAIM SO YOU YOU ARE MAKING A SUCH AS TRAINING ETCETERA BUT THE. ALREADY I HEAR THAT THE TRAINING IS PROVIDED AND THAT WE WERE REQUIRED FOR. AND A WHAT OTHER BENEFITS VIA. HOME CARE OF RECIPIENTS SO WE RECEIVE OUR OF THIS BILL. WELL THIS IS BEING DONE FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE WORKER THERE'S NO DOUBT ABOUT IT AND AND. YES UP THESE FACILITIES THERE OF THESE COMPANIES AT THE DO A MINIMUM OF FIVE HOURS A YEAR OF TRAINING AS IS WHAT'S REQUIRED. AND. ALTHOUGH. THAT'S A BARE MINIMUM REQUIREMENT THE REALITY IS THAT. IN WORKING WITH OTHER LABOR ORGANIZATION THAT SPECIALIZES IN THIS KIND OF THESE KIND OF SERVICES NOT ONLY. TO THE WORKERS HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO GET EVEN MORE AND THE MORE TRAINING AND THE BEST QUALITY TRAINING THEY CAN POSSIBLY GET. OF THE TRAINING WILL BE IS LIMITED STRICTLY TO ISSUES OF OUR. OF THE JOB AND LIMITING THE LIABILITY BUT IT WOULD ALSO INCLUDE RIGHTS RESPONSIBILITIES AS A WORKER AS WELL AS A WRITER AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE EMPLOYER. CHRIS SUPPORT NETWORK WITH THE WORKERS WELL BEING AND MIND. AND THE REALITY IS THAT FOR MANY OF THE COMPANIES ARE THOSE THAT THAT HAVE CONCERNS IF THEY'RE TREATING THEIR WORKERS WELL PAIN THE MILE THAT THERE. IF THEY'RE MAKING SURE THEY'RE PROPERLY TRAINED. THERE'S NINE ISSUE REALLY THIS IS TARGETING THOSE COMPANIES OR THOSE INDIVIDUAL WORKERS WERE A VICTIM OF COMPANIES THAT ARE OF THAT ARE. THE EMPLOYEE WAGE THEFT OF OR IS NOT NOT PROVIDING SAFE ENVIRONMENTS WHERE THERE'S THE ABILITY OTHER HAS A LOT OF ISOLATION. AND SO. THE IDEA BEHIND THIS IS REALLY TO PROVIDE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR WORKERS TO BE ABLE TO NOT ONLY HAVE ACCESS TO ANY BUT TO BE REPRESENTED. I YOU KNOW IT'S I THINK SOMETIMES. WAIT WE'D. I PRESUME THAT IT'S A IT'S AN EASY TASK FOR UP LABOR ANY OTHER ORGANIZATION JUST TO GO IN AND ORGANIZE A REALITY IS THAT THESE WORKERS THAT. THAT IT'S SHOWN ARE NOT ONLY IS THERE RAMPANT WAGE THEFT AND INDUSTRY BUT THERE'S ALL THEIR ALSO A NUMBER OF COMPANIES I DON'T DO ADEQUATE TRAINING EVEN IF THEY DO THE FIVE. HOURS A MINIMUM. WHEN SO. THIS BILL IS REALLY IMPORTANT IN ORDER TO ENSURE UPS AND THAT'S ALMOST ONE TO KEEP MY ONE A PREFACE THIS BY TWO THINGS ONE IS. THE ORIGINAL BILL WAS BROADER THAN JUST LABOR ORGANIZATIONS HAD MORE OR ANY WILL USE THAT TO TRAINING. ALLEGE COUNCIL AYE ADVISE THAT WE KNOW IT. THE AND WE TOOK SUGGESTIONS BOTH FROM LEDGE COUNCIL AS WELL AS OTHER STAKEHOLDERS HOLDERS AND OTHER ASSEMBLY MEMBERS OTHERS OF COLLEAGUES OF MINE. TO NARROW IT OF THE GOVERNOR VETOED IT BE VETOED IT BECAUSE IT WAS RETROACTIVE AND NOT A PROSPECTIVE AYE IT'LL CLINTON'S WE'VE CHANGED THE BILL. TO MAKE IT PERSPECTIVE GAVE IT PASSED TO THE ASSEMBLY AND THE SENATE LAST YEAR BEFORE THOSE CHANGES AND I'M HOPING THAT THESE CHANGES BLOW UP ALLOW THE GOVERNOR TO FOR THE KINDLY UPON. ANOTHER AREA THAT I AM REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT THIS IS SO. ONCE WE PROVIDE A CERTAIN EASY. OUR OPPORTUNITY TO FILE FOR THE UC CARE GIVERS TO UNIONIZE SO. MOSTLY. THE LABOR UNIONS ARE ARE THERE FULL WITH THEIR WELFARE. NAM PROPER TREATMENT OF FROM THEM PEARL YEARS ETCETERA ETCETERA. WHEN. DURING THE HOT NEGOTIATION. FOR WHATEVER CONTRACT IMPLEMENT HELL. A CONTRACT OR OR WE EACH INCREASE WHATEVER WHENEVER YOU KNOW. IT TO SUCH A TIME NOEL GREENLAND DOT HAS REACHED A. THEN THE ONE OF THE TOURS SO THAT THE LABOR UNIONS YOU SO. THAT YOU INACTION. TYPICALLY. NAY A STRIKE. THEN IF FAR THEY USE THAT. TYPE OF EXTREME MATCH YOUR. WHEN THAT ON COME TO AN AGREEMENT. WHAT HAPPENED IS THAT THE PEOPLE WHO HUNDRED PERCENT RELY UPON CARE GIVERS AND THAT THE OUT ON HOW THE A STRIKE? WELL WHAT WOULD THESE PEOPLE BE TAKEN CARE WELL FIRST OF ALL THERE ARE STILL THERE ARE PLENTY OF HOME CARRIES AS WAS ALLUDED TO BY SPIES SOME FOLKS IN OPPOSITION THAT ARE YOU KNOW. AND THERE ARE PLENTY OF FOR COMPANIES THAT DO HAVE UNION LABOR AND SO. THERE'S NO ONE THAT CARES MORE ABOUT THE ONES THAT THEY CARE FOR THAT THE ACTUAL WORKERS BUT I'LL TELL YOU THIS THAT IF THE WORKERS ON CARE FOR WERE NOT BENEFITING THOSE INDIVIDUALS ANYWAY. AT THE WORKERS ARE BEING OVERWORKED THAT ARE PROPERLY TRAINED THAT THERE'S WAIT STEPPED INVOLVED THEN WE'RE NOT TO CARE THAT WORK WAS ACTUALLY TAKING CARE OF THE PERSON THAT'S A NEED. SO. YOU KNOW THIS IS CERTAINLY. OF THE THERE THAT THE ISSUE OF COLLECTIVE BARGAINING EMPOWERS INDIVIDUALS OTHERWISE ARE NOT EMPOWER THAT DON'T HAVE THE POWER AGAINST A COMPANY. AND SO ABSOLUTELY THAT THOUGH COLLECTIVE BARGAINING IS USED TO NOT JUST EMPOWER THE WORKER BUT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE IN THE BEST POSITION TO TAKE CARE OF OUR LOVED ONES WHEN THEY'RE NEEDED. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER COMMENTS. I HAVE HAD SEVERAL CONVERSATIONS WITH BOTH THE SPONSOR AND THE AND THE AUTHOR AND I STILL HAVE SOME CONCERNS OVER. WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE AND I? SPECIFICALLY ASKED ABOUT THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ISSUE I SHARED. COMMENTS ABOUT. ABUSERS. CALLING. THERE THERE'RE SPOUSES OR. WHEN SPOUSES ARE RECEIVING PHONE CALLS THE ABUSERS UP AUTOMATICALLY REACH OUT AND I GIVE AN EXAMPLE OF I'VE MY OWN SISTER WHO WAS A VICTIM OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SHE RECEIVED A PHONE CALL AT TEN PM. AYE IT WAS A BUSINESS CALL AND HER ABUSER WAS. VERY UPSET WITH HER BECAUSE SHE WAS RECEIVING PHONE CALLS FROM STRANGE PEOPLE AND THAT WAS THAT A BIG ISSUE FOR ME WHEN WE HAD THE DISCUSSION IN MY OFFICE ABOUT. WHAT MY CONCERNS ARE? I HOPE THAT WE CAN. ADDRESS THAT ISSUE IF YOU HAVE ANYTHING NOW I. WILL CAN YOU PLEASE MOST CERTAINLY THAT'S WHAT WE'VE LIMITED THE USE OF THE OF OF JUST THE NAME AND THE PHONE NUMBER THAT THEY PROVIDE TO THE REGISTRY AS THE ONLY MEANS OF CONTACT AND ONLY PURPOSE A CONTACT US FOR THE PURPOSE OF THEIR LEGITIMATE. PURPOSES FOR THE LABOR ORGANIZATION WHICH WOULD BE TRAINING ORGANIZING REPRESENTATION I ANYONE THAT'S MILLION WHO THAT'S GOING TO VIOLATE THE LAW AND CREATE AND AND. AND AND. ENGAGED IN CRIMINAL CONDUCT TO VIOLATE OF THEY THE USE THAT INFORMATION SHOULD BE PROSECUTED IN CHARGE AYE ANYONE THAT'S A MEMBER OF A UNION ORGANIZATION THAT USE THAT NUMBER THAT INFORMATION PROPERLY SHOULD BE. SUB LET GO AND PROSECUTED IN CHARGE AND SO THE REALITY IS THAT THAT THAT IT'S A VERY NARROW IN TERMS OF WHO GETS ACCESS. TO THE NAME AND PHONE NUMBER AS OPPOSED TO PUBLIC DATABASES IT'S NOT A PUBLIC DATABASE OF AND IT'S BEEN NEARLY CRAFTED FOR THAT REASON AND THE REALITY IS THAT. PICTURE IT IN MY ESTIMATION THAT AND OF THESE FROM THE INFORMATION THAT WE GET IN TERMS OF BEING CHAIR OF AGING LONG TERM CARE. THE INFORMATION WE GET IN TERMS OF THE PLATE OF HOME CARE AIDES HOMECARE WORKERS ARE FAR MORE OF THEM THAT ARE BEING ABUSED HARASSED SEXUALLY ASSAULTED. BUT DON'T FEEL THEY HAVE A RECOURSE THAT WOULD AT LEAST HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE BETTER REPRESENTATION IF THEY WERE PART OF A UNION AND SO. THAT THE ISSUES OF THAT YOU REYES ARE ABSOLUTELY VALID AND LEGITIMATE AND THAT'S PARTLY WHY WE'VE NARROWED IT AS MUCH AS WE HAVE A BUT I ALSO THINK THAT THE ISSUES OF HARASSMENT AND ABUSE. THAT ARE CURRENTLY OCCURRING GO UNCHECKED. TYPICALLY IF YOU HAVE WORKERS THE WORKING IN ISOLATION THE DON'T FEEL THEY'RE PART OF A SUPPORT NETWORK THAT A LABOR ORGANIZATION CAN PROVIDE THEM. THANK YOU AND THEN THE OTHER COMMENT. THAT I WAS VERY IMPORTANT. FOR US TO TO. YOU WILL INFORM THE EMPLOYEES OF THEIR OPT OUT. PROVISIONS. BECAUSE THAT'S AGAIN ANOTHER CONCERN IS THAT THEY'RE NOT GONNA BE GIVEN THE PROPER INFORMATION EFFORT TALKING ABOUT. ALLOWING THEM TO MAKE THEIR OWN DECISIONS AND THEN THAT IS ALSO VERY IMPORTANT AYE I AGREE EMPTIVELY SOME OF THAT MAY BE IN A SENSE SENSE OF SITUATION THAT MAY BE AN ABUSE SITUATION AND. WOOD WHEN THEY WAY I'D SAY YOU KNOW WHAT I WILL BE GREAT TO BE ABLE TO. CONNECT WITH THE ORGAN AT LABOR ORGANIZATION TO BE GRATEFUL TO GET TRAINING BUT WHEN I WAY THE TWO I'M NOT WILLING TO RISK PUTTING MY GIVEN MY NUMBER OF THEM THAT'S THEIR CHOICE AND WE WOULD NEVER TAKE THAT AWAY. THANK YOU AND THEN. LASTLY I DO HAVE A TO PASS AS AMENDED TO.

THAT BRINGS US TO AB TWENTY ONE FIFTY TWO PAINT WORK IF YOU'RE TOO HUNGRY BILL. A. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF AB TWENTY ONE FIFTY TWO IS A BILL TO HELP PREVENT HUNGER AMONG OUT OF WORK CALIFORNIANS. THE CURRENT FEDERAL RULE ESTABLISHES THAT OUT OF WORK RECIPIENTS OF CAL FRESH ARE LIMITED TO THREE MONTHS OF AID IN ANY THIRTY SIX MONTH PERIOD. CALIFORNIA HAS A WAIVER TO THIS RULE BUT EXPIRES AUGUST OF THIS YEAR. I REQUEST FOR CONTINUED WAIVER FROM SOME COUNTIES WILL WITH HIGHER UNEMPLOYMENT RATES HAVE BEEN SUBMITTED AND IS CURRENTLY BEING CONSIDERED BY THE WHITE HOUSE. BUT A RECENT EXECUTIVE ORDER AND THE NEWLY RELEASED TWENTY EIGHTEEN FARM BILL SUGGEST THAT THE FUTURE OF THESE AREA. AREA WAIVERS DURING TIMES OF HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT ARE UNCLEAR. THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS THAT THE WORK RATE AMONG CALPERS RECIPIENTS A HIGH WITH NEARLY EIGHTY PERCENT OF THOSE ABLE TO WORK EARNING INCOME TO IMPLEMENT. THE CAO FRESH IS THERE TO ALSO HELP PEOPLE WHO WHEN THEY ARE OUT OF WORK OR BETWEEN JOBS. CUTTING PEOPLE OFF FROM A DURING THIS TIME MAKES IT HARDER FOR THEM TO FIND A JOB. BUT AB THIRTY TWENTY ONE FIFTY TWO DOES WILL REQUIRE THAT CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT SOCIAL SERVICES TO ESTABLISH A HUNGER THRESHOLD. THAT WILL IDENTIFY WHEN A PERSON IS TWO HUNDRED TO BE EMPLOYABLE. THE BILL DIRECTS THE DEPARTMENT TO CONVENE A WORK GROUP OF PHYSICIANS AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT SPECIALIST WILL EXPERT IN AN ADULT HUNGER. TO ESTABLISH A THRESHOLD AND BEGIN AND DESIGN A SCREENING TO USE MY COUNTY SOCIAL WORKERS. ONCE IN PLACE A PERSON WHO SCREEN IS BEING UNFIT FOR WORK DUE TO HUNGER WILL BE IF TEMPORARILY EXEMPT FROM THREE MONTH TIME LIMIT. SIMPLY PUT AB TWENTY ONE FIFTY TWO WILL HELP PREVENT OUT OF WORK CALIFORNIANS FROM GOING HUNGRY AND BY DOING SO INCREASING THE LIKELIHOOD THAT THEY WILL BE ABLE TO GET BACK TO WORK. AB TWO INLAND FIFTY TWO SPOTS ABOUT THE CUT WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY HERE TODAY WITH ME TO TEST POSITIVE JESSICA BOTTLE FROM THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY JESSICA. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE JUST ABOUT THE WITH THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY. I'VE SPENT ABOUT TWENTY YEARS AND AS AN ANTIHUNGER ADVOCATE AND ADVOCATING FOR THE CALPERS PROGRAM. AND BUT THAT'S NOT THE ONLY THING THAT MAKES ME AN EXPERT ON HUNGER AND ANTI HUNGER PROGRAMS. I ALSO HAVE BEEN HUNGRY. AND I CAN TELL YOU. PERSONALLY. THAT HUNGER DOESN'T HELP YOU BE BETTER AT ANYTHING. THE FIRST TIME EXPERIENCE CHRONIC HUNGER. I LOST WEIGHT. MY CLOTHES DIDN'T FIT. I WENT FROM BEING THE KID THAT WAS PICKED SECOND. BECAUSE I WAS A GIRL WHENEVER FIRST. TO THE KID THAT WASN'T PICKED FOR THE SPORTS. WAS MY FOURTH GRADE YEAR. AND MY DAD COULDN'T FIND WORK WHO'S A CONSTRUCTION WORKER. AND ON IT WAS A SNOWY WINTER AND LAKE TAHOE. THAT YEAR BECAUSE I WAS IN FOURTH GRADE I WAS A TESTED FOR GATE. AND I WAS PLACED IN THE GATE CLASS. AND THEN I WAS REMOVED FROM THE BACK GATE CLASS BECAUSE I COULDN'T KEEP UP. I COULDN'T STAY AWAKE IN CLASS. THESE ARE THE EXPERIENCES OF PEOPLE CHILDREN ADULTS. PEOPLE WHO ARE VETERANS PEOPLE WHO ARE OLDER. WHO WILL EXPERIENCE HUNGER AS A RESULT OF THE PROPOSED CUTS IN DC? WHO ARE EXPERIENCING HUNGER TODAY BECAUSE? ONLY ABOUT SEVENTY PERCENT OF PEOPLE ELIGIBLE FOR PARTICIPATING. AND THESE ARE THE PEOPLE WHOM I WILL HOPEFULLY BENEFIT FROM. AND THEIR PARENTS OR THEY THEMSELVES HAVING A SCREENING. THE HELPS IDENTIFY WHEN THEY'RE HAVING. THE EXPERIENCE OF CHRONIC HUNGER. SO THAT THEY CAN HAVE A TEMPORARY RELIEF FROM THE MANDATORY WORK REQUIREMENTS IN THE PROGRAM. WHEN THE BILL WAS INTRODUCED WE DIDN'T KNOW THAT THE WHITE HOUSE WAS GOING TO BE INTRODUCING AN EXECUTIVE ORDER MAKING THE WORK REQUIREMENTS HARDER. AND WE DIDN'T KNOW THAT A. THE HOUSE AGRICULTURE COMMITTEE WOULD BE PASSING A A FARM BILL ON A PARTISAN BASIS WHICH. I'M NOT ONLY SHORTENS THE TIME LIMIT FROM THREE MONTHS TO ONE MONTH FOR OUT OF WORK AMERICANS BUT ALSO APPLY TO TO FAMILIES WITH CHILDREN. SO WE'RE SO GRATEFUL AND FOR THE FAMILY LEGISLATION AND. WE URGE YOUR AT YOUR VOTE YOUR AYE VOTE FOR THE BILL. FROM WESTERN CENTER AND FOR ME PERSONALLY ON BEHALF OF HUNGRY AMERICANS APPRECIATE YOUR IBOOK THANK YOU THANK YOU. ANY OTHER OF WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. REBECCA GONZALEZ NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF SOCIAL WORKERS CALIFORNIA CHAPTER IN STRONG SUPPORT. ANGELA WILLIAMS CALIFORNIA BLACK HEALTH THAT WORK IN SUPPORT. LAURIE FURSTENFELD FROM THE CHILD CARE LAW CENTER IN SUPPORT. KEVIN AS THEIR QUARTERS CALIFORNIA WELFARE RIGHTS ORGANIZATION STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. CASEY MEN AND. ANYONE FROM THE COMMITTEE. THANK YOU I I HAVE A QUESTION TO THE AUTHOR ARE AYE HOUSE SUPPORT TERM. YOUR. BILL IN CONCEPT THE. BUT THE HOLLOW WHICH YOU. ENSURE A DATA CABLE OR BODY OWNERS TRY. TO LOOK FOR A JOB BUT AND INTENTIONALLY TRY TO AVOID. EGGMAN EMPLOYMENT TOOK WHEN. YOU MAKE IT EASIER. ARE WHY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. IS A TRACK TO TIGHTEN UP THAT THE RESOURCES SUCH AS AVAILABLE MIGHT FEDERAL BLOOM. BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE IS A TRULY HUNGRY PEOPLE URGE A SHOULD BE HELPED UP BUT THE. NOW. AS. YOUR FREE MONEY IT IS AVAILABLE AND CONTINUOUSLY AND. A REPEAT THIS ARE INCENTIVIZE OF THE WUSA. OF WHO DON'T WANT TO WORK AND US SICK FOR EMPLOYMENT. JOINT WAS FUN TO EXPAND THOSE WHO REALLY MATTER. BETTER. I AM. S. ARIAS IT MAKES ME A LITTLE EMOTIONAL BONTA TO HEAR THE QUESTION. BECAUSE I THINK THAT. THERE'S A GREAT ASSUMPTION THAT LOW INCOME PEOPLE WILL TAKE ADVANTAGE OF PROGRAMS. IF THEIR THEIR. AND THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS. THAT NOBODY GROWS UP THINKING HEY I WANT TO BE ON FOOD STAMPS. THERE ARE PEOPLE. UP WHO THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE WHO CHEAT THE SYSTEM. OF WE HAVE ONE OF THE BEST ANTI FRAUD OF PROGRAMS IN SNAP IT'S IT HAS ONE OF THE LOWEST ERROR RATES. THAN ANY GOVERNMENT PROGRAM IN THE COUNTRY. ON. AND. AND EVEN IF THERE ARE A HANDFUL OF PEOPLE THAT WILL CHEAT. IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO PUNISH EVERYBODY ELSE BECAUSE THEY DO IT'S CRUEL. TO LET SOMEBODY GO WITHOUT FOOD. ON AND THAT WE DO THAT IN A STATE AS WEALTHY AND. AS GREAT AS WE ARE. MAKES NO SENSE ON. THIS BILL I WILL REQUIRE PEOPLE TO CERTIFY. THAT THEY HAVE EXPERIENCED HUNGER. A AT THE RATE THAT WOULD QUALIFY THEM FOR THE EXEMPTION SO SELF CERTIFICATION WOULD BE REQUIRED UNLIKELY THOUGH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF WOULD BE UP TO THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES. AND DOWN. I PERSONALLY HAVE GREAT FAITH IN THE DEPARTMENT AND THE COUNTY ADMINISTRATORS OF FOR THE WORK THAT THEY DO TO KEEP THE PROGRAM. WORKING THE WAY IT SHOULD BECAUSE PEOPLE WHO ARE LOW INCOME AND. WHO RELY ON THE PROGRAM? WANT TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE DON'T CHEAT TO THEM THERE'S NO NOBODY. WHO HATES A WELFARE TO? BUY MORE THAN A WELFARE RECIPIENT. AND THAT'S THAT IS THE TRUTH SO ON. WE WOULD WE WOULD TRUST THAT THAT THE COUNTY AND THE STATE ADMINISTRATORS WOULD. IMPLEMENT THOUGH THE LIES ARE REQUIRED TO IN WAYS THAT WOULD PREVENT FRAUD. CANNABIS IT WILL LOOK AS A FOLLOW UP QUESTION. WITH A SORCERER DEPARTMENT SOCIAL SERVICES ARE IF I ASK FOR OF. OF FREE FOOD AND THE UC MIA I'M A POOR BODY AND I SHOULD BE ABLE TO WORK A AND THEN. CAN YOU OFFER ME A JOB IF I THEY'VE REFUSE IT THAT WOULD I BE DISQUALIFIED. THERE ARE A THERE'S THEIR CURRENT OF REGULATIONS AND THAT WOULD REQUIRE YOU TO LOOK FOR WORK AND REGISTER FOR WORK THIS WOULDN'T. EAT IT NOTHING ABOUT THIS A BILL WOULD RELIEVE PEOPLE OF THEIR REQUIREMENT TO REGISTER FOR WORK. AND THERE ARE OTHER POLICIES IN THE FOOD STAMP PROGRAM AND THAT WOULD SAY FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU ARE IF YOU ARE OFFERED A JOB. AND YOU REFUSE IT. THAT'S A DIFFERENT A DIFFERENT PART OF THE LAW AND YOU WOULD BE DENIED BENEFITS FOR A PERIOD OF THREE MONTHS. IF YOU HAVE A JOB AND YOU. IT IF YOU HAVE A JOB AND YOU QUIT THE JOB VOLUNTARILY. YOU'RE ALSO DISQUALIFIED FOR A PERIOD OF THREE MONTHS OR IF YOU APPLY FOR BENEFITS AFTER HAVING VOLUNTARILY QUIT A JOB. YOU'RE INELIGIBLE THIS BILL WOULDN'T CHANGE ANY PART OF THAT. YOU'RE ALSO NOT ALLOWED TO REDUCE YOUR HOURS BELOW TWENTY HOURS A WEEK. UNDER CURRENT LAW AT OR ELSE YOU WOULD BECOMING ELIGIBLE FOR THE PROGRAM EITHER AS AN APPLICANT OR RECIPIENT AND THAT'S ALSO CURRENT LAW. AMANITA PLACE TO FAMILIES WITH CHILDREN OR FAMILIES WITHOUT CHILDREN. SO. IN YOUR EXAMPLE. IF YOU TURN DOWN A JOB. AND. A OR IF YOU QUIT A JOB OR IF YOU REDUCE YOUR HOURS BELOW A CERTAIN THRESHOLD YOU WOULD BE DENIED AID AND NOTHING ABOUT THIS THIS BILL WOULD. PREVENT THAT. THANK. THINKING JUST FOR CLARIFICATION YOU ARE ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENT ACCEPTING THEM AND CHIPS THANK YOU OUT WITH THAT WHICH IS LIKE CLOTHES SURE OF I'VE I APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATION AND. AS POINTED OUT YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S COOL TO BE IN THE STATE'S WEALTHIEST CALIFORNIA. AND THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE HUNGRY. SO HUNGRY THAT THEY CAN'T FUNCTION THAT THEY CAN'T THINK WE SEE THAT IN OUR SCHOOLS EVERY DAY. THE CHILDREN WHO ARE HOMELESS IN WHO WERE HUNGRY AND WHEN THE WEALTHY STATE IN THE WORLD. I NEVER WANT TO EVER DIDN'T I HELPING SOMEONE BECAUSE SOMEONE ELSE WHO DOESN'T NEED HELP MIGHT BENEFIT FROM IT. YOU KNOW THE BY WILL ALWAYS TELLS AT THE SUN SHINES ON THE JUST AND THE UNJUST AT THE SAME TIME. UP AND THERE'S ALWAYS CONSEQUENCES OF EVERYTHING FOR THOSE WHO DECIDE TO CHEAT BUT WE ABOVE THE LOTS OF EFFORTS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO AVOID THOSE WHO COMMIT FRAUD WHO CHEAT. AND YOU STILL HAVE SOME WHO DO WE HAVE FOLKS WHO CHEAT ON THEIR TAXES WOULD NOT EVEN OF GOVERNMENT RECIPIENTS AT ALL. BUT SIMPLY BUT DO THAT BECAUSE THAT'S WHO THEY ARE AND SO I WOULD I WOULD HOPE THAT WE WOULD FOCUS ON. WHAT THE REAL ISSUE IS AT HAND IS THAT THAT WE HAVE A LOT OF FOLKS WILL HUNGRY? O. SOMETIMES AS A GOVERNMENT AGENCY WE TRY TO PUT A LOT OF STIPULATIONS ON THINGS THAT MAKE IT SO COMPLICATED. THAT WE ALMOST BENEFIT NO ONE. AND. I'VE TOLD SOME STUDENTS RECENTLY BECAUSE OF ALL THE HUNGER BILLS WE DONNA CAMPUSES. THAT WAS KIND OF GLAD THAT THE LEGISLATURE DID NOT TAKE UP THE ISSUE OF REGULATING THEIR FOOD BANKS AND THEIR THEIR PANTRIES IN THOSE KINDS OF THINGS. BECAUSE OF SO THAT PROBABLY NO ONE WOULD EVER GET FOOD. OF BUT THE STUDENTS HAVE THE KIND OF HEART THAT NOBODY WANTS TO REALLY ASK FOR FOOD NO ONE WANTS TO BE AN ASSISTANCE. THEY ALL HELP OUT AND WHEN SOMEONE SAYS I'M HUNGRY THEY COME TO BELIEVE THEM WE'RE GONNA DEVELOP A DIFFERENT SYSTEM THOUGH THAT WOULD HAVE A OF METRICS IN WHICH THEY COULD LOOK AT. THE ISSUE OF HUNGER IN A PERSON'S LIFE AND MAKE SURE THAT THAT HAS BECOME AN IMPEDIMENT TO IT BUT I THINK IT'S A STATE AS GREAT AS THIS NATION. IF YOU PASS BY SOMEONE WHO'S HUNGRY AND YOU DON'T FEEL THE SENSE OF PAIN YOURSELF AND SOMETHING IS REALLY WRONG WITH YOU. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOU AYE VOTE FOR AB TWENTY ONE FIFTY TWO. I AM DOCTOR WEBER AND I JUST WANNA CLARIFY THINK I HEARD IT A COUPLE TIMES THAT IT IN THE STATE AS WHAT THE OZAWA. IS THAT AS WE ARE THAT IT'S COOL IT'S JUST CRUEL NO MATTER WHAT STATE WHEREIN. I AND I JUST WANNA MAKE THAT POINT BECAUSE IT'S COOL JUST FOR KIDS TO BE HUNGRY I WAS A TEACHER FOR SENIORS AND. I HAD. TO TEACH KIDS THAT DIDN'T HAVE FOOD. WE'RE EXPECTING THEM TO LEARN. TO READ IN THAT REGARD READ WRITE AN ARITHMETIC RIGHT AND AND WILL THEY DON'T HAVE PROPER PROPER MEALS AND. SO I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S NOT JUST COHEN THE STATE LIKE OURS IT'S JUST CRUEL CREATED PERIOD AND SO WITH THAT.

AB THIRTY SEVENTY FOUR EMPOWERS INDIVIDUALS WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES THROUGH AN INTEGRATED COMPETITIVE EMPLOYMENT. THIS BILL WILL ALLOW FOR ON THE JOB SKILLS TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES THROUGH COMMUNITY BASED VOCATIONAL SERVICES. YOU HEARD THIS BILL LAST YEAR AND IT'S BACK BECAUSE IT'S IMPERATIVE WE EXPAND EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES TO INDIVIDUALS. WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. I'M ADDRESSING THE GOVERNOR'S VETO MESSAGE BY WORKING WITH THE DDS THROUGH THE THROUGH THE BUDGET. A LONG TERM INVESTMENT IMPLEMENT FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH AIDID DE BRINGS IN A RETURN TO CALIFORNIA BY ALLOWING MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY TO BECOME SELF RELIANT. AND LESS DEPENDENT ON PUBLIC ASSISTANCE. I HOPE YOU CAN JOIN ME IN SUPPORT OF A COMMUNITY THAT IS DEAR TO MY HEART. WITH ME TODAY IS VERY JOURNEY WOULD CALIFORNIA'S ABILITY SERVICES AND MY GOOD FRIEND AUDRA. A SITE SOME TO EXPRESS THEIR SUPPORT AND ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. VERY. THANK YOU FIRST WITNESS PLEASE GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIR OTHER GETTING FROM THE CALIFORNIA DISABILITY SERVICES ASSOCIATION WE'RE PROUD TO SPONSOR AB THIRTY SEVENTY FOUR AS A FAMILY MEMBER SAID WITH HER SECOND GO ROUND AT THIS. AND WHEN I THINK ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRAZIER FOR BRINGING THIS BILL. AS WELL AS BEING A CHAMPION FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES AYE IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE AN EMPLOYMENT FIRST POLICIES THAT. PRIORITIZE OPPORTUNITIES FOR COMPETITIVE INTEGRATED EMPLOYMENT FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES REGARDLESS OF THE SEVERITY OF THEIR DISABILITIES. BUT UNFORTUNATELY STILL OF UNEMPLOYMENT RATES APPROACHING THE NINETY PERCENT MARK FOR FOR THAT PART FOR THIS POPULATION. AND WHAT WE SEE IS THAT OF MISSING LINK IS EMPLOYMENT EXPLORATION AND JOB DISCOVERY IN SOME THE PRE VOCATIONAL SERVICES THAT ARE REQUIRED. OR BITTER COULD FACILITATE THAT COMPETITIVE INTEGRATE EMPLOYMENT. AND SO AB THIRTY SEVENTY FOUR REALLY HAS A TWO TWO MAIN GOALS. IN IN TWO WAYS TO ADDRESS THAT THAT GAP IMPROVE OCCASIONAL SERVICES. THE FIRST IS TO ADDRESS THE. COMMUNITY BASED VOCATIONAL DEVELOPMENT SERVICES THAT WERE ORIGINALLY CHAPTER IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN THROUGH S. B. FIVE SEVENTY SEVEN. UNFORTUNATE THAT BILL WAS NEVER IMPLEMENTED BECAUSE IT REQUIRED FEDERAL FINANCIAL PARTICIPATION AND WE. WHERE INFORMED BY DDS THAT WOULD IT WOULD NEED A STANDALONE WAIVER WITH CMS IN ORDER TO GO INTO EFFECT? WHAT WE'VE DONE HERE IS THAT REMOVE THE PILOT LANGUAGE FROM THE BILL SO THAT THE THE COMMUNITY BASED FOCUS ON DEVELOPMENT SERVICES COULD BE WRAPPED INTO THE EXISTING H. CBS WAIVER? AND THEREFORE WOULD NOT REQUIRE ANY YOU KNOW NEW WAVER WITH CMS AT THE SECOND AIM IS TO WORK ON FOLKS WHO ARE IN SUPPORT EMPLOYMENT GROUPS OR WORK ACTIVITY PROGRAM STATE PROVIDE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THEM. TO TRANSITION INTO MORE COMPETITIVE INTEGRATE EMPLOYMENT IF THAT'S THEIR CHOICE SO THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO USE TAYLOR DAY SERVICES IN CONJUNCTION WITH THEIR EXISTING SERVICES TO FACILITATE ON THOSE EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES. AND OUTCOMES. WITH ME TODAY IS UNDER SUCH THEM AND I ONE OF JUST GIVE HER THE FLOOR FOR THE REST THE TIME TO. SPEAK TO HER EXPERIENCE AND WHAT SHE WOULD. LIKE TO SEE YOUR SUPPORT ON THIS BILL THANK YOU. MISSOURI. I HAVE A. MOVIE AND THE OTHER DO DIFFERENTLY. PAVE IF BURKE TO AND I I LOVE IT AYE. AYE MOON CHANGE.

THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION HAS MADE IT POSSIBLE FOR COUNTY TO PRIVATIZE ITS ELIGIBILITY WORKFORCE WITH THE WAIVER APPROVAL. NOTHING PREVENTS A COUNTY FROM ASKING FOR A WAIVER AT ANY TIME. AND CAN BE REQUESTED WITHOUT THE OVERSIGHT OF THE LEGISLATURE OR AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE PUBLIC COMMENT. THE MARRIAGE OR CIVIL SERVICE STATUS OF PERSONNEL WHO DETERMINE ELIGIBILITY FOR SAFETY NET PROGRAM BENEFITS IS AN ESSENTIAL FEATURE OF SAFETY NET PROGRAMS. THE JOB PROTECTIONS THAT COME WITH MARY AND POLICE SYSTEMS ARE THE BEST WAY TO ENSURE THAT WHISTLEBLOWING AS AN OPTION FOR WORKERS WHEN THE PROGRAM IS NOT WORKING AS IT SHOULD. WHEN FOR PROFIT ENTITIES COMPETE FOR CONTRACTS THE PRODUCTS THEY DEVELOP AND THE INFORMATION COLLECTED FROM CLIENTS IS DEAN PROPRIETARY TO THE COMPANY.

CRUCIAL FIRST STEP IN CREATING A VISION FOR A DATA SYSTEM TO CONNECT OUR CHILD CARE SYSTEM. AFTER SURVIVING THE DEVASTATING CUTS FROM THE RECESSION IT'S TIME TO EVOLVE TO A STRONGER CONNECTED FAMILY CENTERED SYSTEM WITH A STATEWIDE SYSTEM. AB TWENTY NINE SIXTY ESTABLISHES OF STAKEHOLDER PROCESS TO HELP INFORM THE DATA SYSTEM AND WE ENVISION THE STATE OF SYSTEM SUPPORTING AGENCIES BUT TRULY BEING A RESOURCES. FOR PARENTS DEFINING THE CARE THAT THAT BEST SUITS THEIR CHILDREN THANK YOU. THANK YOU. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE RWANDA COMMO WITH THE CALIFORNIA CHILD CARE RESOURCE AND REFERRAL NETWORK THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY NINE SIXTY. THE CONVENING OF A STAKEHOLDER GROUP TO DEVELOP THE COMPONENTS OF THE ONLINE PORTAL IS CRITICAL TO INSURE THAT THE CONNECTED INFORMATION INFRASTRUCTURE MAKES IT EASIER FOR PARENTS TO ACCESS THE VAST RESOURCES. ON CHILD CARE DEVELOPMENT SERVICES IN CALIFORNIA AND ALSO SUPPORTS OUR CHILD CARE PROVIDERS THE STATE MADE ITS SMALL ONE TIME INVESTMENT IN FISCAL YEAR FIFTEEN SIXTEEN TO DEVELOP CONSUMER EDUCATION WEBSITE TO FULFILL THE CHILDCARE DEVELOPMENT BLOCK GRANT REQUIREMENTS. THE CALIFORNIA CHILDCARE RESOURCE AND REFERRAL NETWORK HAS BEEN LEADING THIS WORK IN PARTNERSHIP WITH LOCAL RESOURCE AND REFERRAL ORGANIZATIONS AND AGENCIES. THE CONSUMER EDUCATION SITE MY CHILD CARE PLAN DOT ORG IS JUST ONE COMPONENT OF THE LARGER EAZY E. SYSTEM OUGHT TO PROVIDE PARENTS WITH ANOTHER ACCESS POINT.

ARE ARE THE ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT PROGRAMS ARE THE ONLY ENTITY THAT ACTUALLY DO THE CASE MANAGEMENT. AND OUR CONCERNS SURROUND. WE SUPPORT THE INTENT OF THE BILL FOR THE PROVIDER PORTAL AND PROVIDING INFORMATION. WHERE OUR RESERVATIONS? ARISE. IS BASED ON THE CENTRAL PORTAL FOR INCOME ELIGIBILITY DETERMINATION. HISTORY HAS SHOWN US THAT WHEN YOU DO A SYSTEM FOR ALL FAMILIES BUT YOU DON'T ACTUALLY RECOGNIZE THE UNIQUE NEEDS OF THE SUBSIDY FAMILIES OF WHICH THE AP'S ARE THE ONLY ONES. THAT HAVE THAT UNIQUE UNDERSTANDING. THEN THE FAMILIES IN THE SUBSIDY SYSTEM ARE THE ONES THAT ACTUALLY GET HURT THEY FALL THROUGH THE CRACKS. WE HAD A CENTRALIZED ELIGIBILITY LIST BEFORE. AND THEY WERE ALL GOOD INTENTIONS TO GET IT GOING AND WHAT HAPPENED. THE FUNDING WAS LOST PEOPLE DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THE SYSTEM AND FAMILIES FELL THROUGH THE CRACKS. SO. ADDITIONALLY IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY THEY HAVE GRAVE CONCERNS ON THIS LANGUAGE BECAUSE THEY HAVE SECURED. LOCAL FUNDING TO DEVELOP A PORTAL AND TO DEVELOP A WEBSITE FOR ALL FAMILIES BUT REALLY HEAVILY FOCUSED ON SUBSIDY FAMILIES. SO WE SEE A LOT OF DUPLICATION WITH WHAT THEY'RE DOING BUT THERE HASN'T YET BEEN A REAL ASSESSMENT. UP WHAT IS CURRENTLY OUT THERE SO SO AGAIN WE WANNA RAISE THAT WE WHOLEHEARTEDLY SUPPORT THAT PROVIDER PORTAL. AND SHARING OF INFORMATION OUR RESERVATIONS ARE ARE SURROUNDING HEALTH THE FAMILIES THAT ARE INCOME ELIGIBLE THE SUBSIDY FAMILIES. COME INTO THE SYSTEM WE ALREADY HAVE A SYSTEM THAT WORKS BEAUTIFULLY ARMED WITH OUR COUNTY PARTNERS. AND WE WOULD SAY. LET LET'S BUILD ON IT BUT LET'S NOT REPLICATE IT THANK YOU.

A CONTINUED TO WORK WITH THE COMMITTEE AS THE BILL MOVES FORWARD. SENATE BILL THREE THIRTY THIRTY NINE IS ONE OF THREE BILLS. IN A RESTORATIVE JUSTICE PACKAGE TO REDUCE. BARRIERS TO ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY FOR FORMERLY INCARCERATED CALIFORNIANS. THIS BILL SPECIFICALLY CREATES A FAIR CHANCE FOR PEOPLE WITH THE REST WERE CONVICTION RECORDS TO ACCESS CARE GIVING. AND OTHER JOBS GOVERNED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES. AB THIRTY THIRTY NINE WOULD GRANT CLEARANCES AND ELIMINATE THE EXEMPTION. PROCESS FOR APPLICANTS WHO WERE CONVICTED OF A NON DIRECTLY OR NON ADVERSELY RELATED CRIME WITHIN THE PRECEDING FIVE YEARS. APPLICANTS WHO WERE CONVICTED OF A CRIME OLDER THAN FIVE YEARS AT THE TIME OF APPLICATION WITH THE EXCEPTION OF VIOLENT FELONIES. ADDITIONALLY AB THIRTY THREE NINE WILL REQUIRE THE DEPARTMENT SOCIAL SERVICES TO BEGIN COLLECTING DATA FROM CLARENCE AN EXEMPTION APPLICATIONS SPECIFICALLY DEMOGRAPHICS ON AGE. ETHNICITY GENDER AND CONVICTED CRIMES FROM APPLICATIONS THAT ARE DENIED CLEARANCE AND EXEMPTIONS CURRENTLY THIS INFORMATION IS NOT COLLECTED FROM APPLICATIONS THAT ARE DENIED OR GRANTED CLEARANCE OR EXEMPTIONS WHICH IS A GREAT DISSERVICE. TO THE FACILITIES AND LEGAL CENTERS THAT FIGHT EVERY DAY TO END THE UNINTENTIONAL RACISM AND OUR EMPLOYMENT SYSTEM. THIS DATA WILL SHOW THE CONSISTENT OPERABLE PORTION OF MARGINALIZEDCOMMUNITIES WHO ARE OVER POLICED AND OVER CONVICTED. AND WILL HIGHLIGHT THE NEED FOR CHANGE IN OUR CURRENT SYSTEM. FURTHERMORE IT HAS BEEN SHOWN THROUGH DATA AND STUDIES THAT ONLY A VERY SMALL PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE WHO DID COMMIT A CRIME. A FEW YEARS PRIOR ACTUALLY RECIDIVISM. PROVIDING THAT REHABILITATION WORKS AND PEOPLE CAN CHANGE. FOR THIS REASON THIS BILL HAS BEEN ENDORSED BY THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS AS IT IS BLACK AND LATINO WOMEN WHO SUFFER THE CONSEQUENCES OF A BROKEN SYSTEM. AS THIS BILL MOVES THROUGH THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS I'M PERSONALLY. COMMITTING TO WORK WITH THE DEPARTMENT. THE COMMITTEE. AND THE OPPOSITION TO STRIKE A BALANCE BETWEEN RESTORATIVE JUSTICE AND PROTECTION FOR VULNERABLE POPULATIONS. IT HAS BEEN PROVEN TO BE A CHALLENGE. TO GET EVERYONE TO THE TABLE. AND WITH THIS LANGUAGE WE WILL BE ABLE TO MAKE REAL CHANGES TOGETHER. THEREFORE I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE ON THIS A BILL AB THIRTY THIRTY NINE WITH ME TODAY I HAVE ONE OF OUR SPONSORS. VEENA NAIK AT. MAKE. FROM THE EAST BAY COMMUNITY LAW CENTER AND ALSO JOINING ME AS OTHER DOE. AND IMPACTED DSS APPLICANT. THINK YEAH BEFORE WE CONTINUE I JUST WANTED TO MAKE A NOTE THAT AS OF FIVE THIRTY PM LAST NIGHT AND UP UPDATE IN ABOUT ANALYSIS FOR THIS BILL WAS RELEASED THE UPDATED VERSION NO LONGER CONTAIN SUGGESTED COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS. YET WE WERE IN MY OFFICE ITSELF FIVE THIRTY I WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR WORKING AND THANK YOU FOR ARE COMING OVER AND BEING WILLING TO. HAVE THIS DISCUSSION SO I LOOK FORWARD TO THAT WITH THAT CAN TAKE YOU. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR RUBIO COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS BETH AND I CAN I AM AN ATTORNEY AT THE EAST BAY COMMUNITY LAW CENTER. A. B. THIRTY THIRTY NINE PROVIDES A FAIR CHANCE TO FORMALLY CAN INCARCERATED APPLICANTS FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES. CURRENTLY THE PROCESSES FOR ANY CRIMINAL CONVICTION DESPITE AGE OF THE CONVICTION RELATEDNESS OF THE CONVICTION. PRIOR WORK HISTORY OR ANY REHABILITATION FACTORS THAT THEY MUST GO THROUGH A LENGTHY EXEMPTION PROCESS THAT CAN TAKE AN AVERAGE OF SIX MONTHS OR LONGER. SOME OF THE CLIENTS WHO WE HAVE HELPED TO HAD. CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS FROM OVER FORTY YEARS BEFORE WE SEE FOLKS WALKING THE DOOR ALL THE TIME WITH CONNECTIONS FROM FIFTEEN TWENTY THIRTY YEARS AGO THEY'RE STILL HAVING TO GO THROUGH THIS PROCESS. WHETHER IT'S BEEN JUDICIALLY DISMISSED THEY'VE RECEIVED CLEARANCES THERE IN HOME SUPPORTIVE SERVICES AS A CERTIFIED NURSING ASSISTANT OR THROUGH THE. BORDER BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES SOCIAL WORKERS WHEN THEY'RE TRYING TO WORK IT FACILITIES. THE PEOPLE WHO ARE JUST PROPORTIONALLY IMPACTED OUR WOMEN OF COLOR AS AFRICAN AMERICANS ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. THE NATIONAL EMPLOYMENT LAW PROJECT HAS DATA AND STUDIES THAT SUPPORT THE FINDINGS AFTER SOMETIME. WHETHER IT'S TEN MONTHS AFTER RELEASE OR AT SIX TO SEVEN YEARS AFTER RELEASE. THE CRIMINAL RECORD IS NOT A RELIABLE INDICATOR OF FUTURE CRIMINAL ACTIVITY. AS SUCH LEGISLATURE HAS FOUND IS IN THE INTEREST OF PUBLIC SAFETY TO ASSIST IN REHABILITATION AND REMOVE IMPEDIMENTS TO FORMALLY INCARCERATED PEOPLE. AND AT THE EAST BAY COMMUNITY LAW CENTER THE ALAMEDA COUNTY PUBLIC DEFENDER'S OFFICE AND A NEW WAY OF LIFE FOR INTER PROJECT IN LOS ANGELES WE ARE VERY PROUD TO SAY. THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF CLIENTS WHO ARE SEEKING THESE EXEMPTIONS ARE SUCCESSFUL AT THE END OF THE DAY WHICH SUPPORTS THE PRESUMPTION THAT DSS TENDS TO HEAVILY SKEWED TOWARDS DENYING THE EXEMPTION. ODDS ARE DENIED THE APPLICATION THE FIRST PLACE BASED ON CRIMINAL HISTORY BUT ULTIMATELY CLEARING THE PERSON AND ALLOWING THEM TO WORK IN THE FACILITY. I RECOGNIZE THAT THIS CONVERSATION WILL CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD TO ALLOW STAKEHOLDERS TO PARTICIPATE AND TO ENSURE THAT WE'RE HEARING ALL VOICES AND I. THANK YOU FOR THAT AMENDMENT LAST NIGHT.

THE SCHOOL WANTED TO KEEP ME AND I WANTED TO WORK. THE DSS ARE SAID THAT BASED ON MY PAST MISDEMEANORS. AND THAT I SHOULDN'T WORK WITH CHILDREN. MY MISDEMEANORS ARE APPROXIMATELY. FIVE TO TEN YEARS AGO ALL OF WHICH I AM HAVE BEEN CLEARED. IN COURT ON THROUGH THE COURTS. WHEN MR METERS ALL RESULTED FROM MY PAST DRINKING PROBLEM. MY DRINKING STEMMED FROM AN ABUSIVE RELATIONSHIP AN ENORMOUS PAIN. AND EVENTUALLY LED ME TO HOMELESSNESS. THROUGH THE GRACE OF GOD I AM I AND. A LOT OF HARD WORK AND I HAVE CHANGED MY LIFE AROUND AND IMPROVED MY SITUATION. I WILL NEVER GO BACK TO THAT LOW POINT IN MY LIFE AGAIN. FOR THE LAST FOUR YEARS. HOW COME I'VE HAD MY DRINKING UNDER CONTROL? AND MY BEHAVIOR. IS NO LONGER A PROBLEM. AGAIN THE COURTS HAVE DISMISSED ALL MY CONVICTIONS. I AM I HAVE THREE CHILDREN ONE BE AN ARTISTIC. I'M MY A TOP AUTISTIC SEND HOME PRESCHOOL TEACHER. I WANTED TO GIVE ME A JOB. I'M. BUT I HAVE TO AND IF I CAN GET THE DSS HAS PERMISSION TO WORK THERE. I WOULD LOVE TO WORK OR EVEN VOLUNTEER. I IN MY SON'S SCHOOL BUT I CAN'T BECAUSE OF MY PAST MISTAKES. I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO SAY THAT THE DSS IS APPLICATION PROCESS TARIQ. QUEST PERMISSION TO WORK SHOULD BE REVISED TO GIVE PEOPLE A FAIR CHANCE. CHAU. WHAT THEY'RE LIKE TODAY NOT WHAT THEY WERE IN THE PAST? ALL OF THIS HAS BEEN. THE DEPRESSING AND DEMORALIZING. PROCESS. IT MAKES IT SEEM LIKE THE DSS DOES NOT WANT. FIND OUT WHETHER YOU'VE CHANGED. WHETHER PERSON HAS CHANGED EXCUSE ME. I HOPE THAT THE PROCESS CAN BE MADE EASIER. AND THAT PEOPLE LIKE ME WHO HAVE MOVED PAST HOME. CARP MISTAKES. CAN WORKING PLACES THAT WANT TO HIRE THEM. I FEEL THAT. MYSELF AND OTHERS HAVE A LOT TO OFFER. AND ARE STILL VALUABLE. THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK HIM GOD BLESS. THANK YOU. I IT. ANY OTHER WITNESSES AND SUPPORT. REBEKAH GONZALEZ NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF SOCIAL WORKERS CALIFORNIA CHAPTER IN STRONG SUPPORT.

THANK YOU. KEVIN AS THEIR COALITION CALIFORNIA WILL FOR RIGHTS ORGANIZATION STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU THANK YOU. KING ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION DO YOU MIND LETTING OUR CITIES THANK. BOTTOM CHERRY JUST CURIOUS WHAT THE AMENDMENT IS. THE AMENDMENT IS ESSENTIALLY TO CONTINUE AND YOU ARE I'M SORRY I'M AMY SKI ACTIONS WHO WITH THE CALIFORNIA CHILDCARE RESOURCE AND REFERRAL NETWORK OKAY IT IS TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH. DEPARTMENT OUTSIDE DSS BUT ALSO TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH OTHERS WHO HAD QUESTIONS REGARDING THE BILL THERE WAS CLEARLY AN OPPORTUNITY. THAT WE WERE REACHING OUT TO DSS TO THIS PROCESS TO GET THEM TO THE TABLE. PARADED REASONS THAT DID NOT HAPPEN AND SO WE'RE NOT. OF MINIMIZING SOME OF THE THE ISSUES AND CONCERNS. OF THAT NEED TO BE ADDRESSED BUT GIVEN THE TIMEFRAME WHERE WE'RE TRYING TO AT LEAST KEEP THE BILL MOVING FORWARD. AND TO BE ABLE TO. INTEGRATE YES COMMITTEES CONCERNS I GUESS WHAT WHAT CLARIFICATION THE BILL IN PRINT IS WHAT WHAT WHAT I IS IN THE FACT. THAT WE'RE SUPPOSED AMENDMENTS THAT WE. THE V. NECK DOWN. AND SO WE'RE MOVING THE BILL AS IT AS IT IS WITH THE ASSURANCES FROM. THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER THAT WERE CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE SS OKAY SO AGAIN I'M KEY IS TO INTO A FROM THAT CALIFORNIA CHILDCARE RESOURCE AND REFERRAL NETWORK. AND I PUT OUR. OUR CONCERNS IN OPPOSITION IS BASED ON WHAT IS IN PRINT COME BECAUSE WE DO FEEL LIKE WITH THE AMENDMENTS THAT ARE PROPOSED THAT IT LIKELY WILL ADDRESS BUT. TODAY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WHAT'S HERE. SO I JUST WANT TO EXPRESS WHAT OUR CONCERNS ARE. AND. SO THE NETWORK IS NAMED IN HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE. TO PERFORM CERTAIN FUNCTIONS RELATED TO CALIFORNIA'S TRUST LINE BACKGROUND CHECK. SO WE'VE CONTRACTED WITH EITHER DSS OF THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE I'M SINCE NINETEEN NINETY TWO TO PERFORM THESE FUNCTIONS AND THEY WERE VERY FAMILIAR WITH CSS SAYS. BACKGROUND CHECKS FOR CHILDCARE PROVIDERS SO WE WHOLEHEARTEDLY AGREE WITH THE BILL AS INTENSE AS DESCRIBED BY THE SPONSOR AND DESCRIBED BY ON THE AUTHOR BUT AS THE LEGISLATION IS CURRENTLY WRITTEN IT PRIORITIZES SUPPORTING ADULT MONEY TO BE A CAREGIER OVER PROTECTING CHILDREN IN CHILD CARE. AND. ARRANGEMENTS ELIMINATES SIXTY SERIOUS CRIME CATEGORIES THAT ARE NOW CONSIDERED NON EXEMPT A BALL WHICH INCLUDES FELONY CONVICTIONS OF MURDER. WILLFUL CHILD CRUELTY OR HUMAN TRAFFICKING. CURRENTLY INDIVIDUALS WITH CONVICTIONS FOR ANY OF THESE CRIMES ARE AUTOMATICALLY DENIED THE ABILITY TO PROVIDE CHILD CARE. AND THAT BILL WOULD REQUIRE DSS TO CONSIDER INDIVIDUALS CONVICTED OF THE SERIOUS AND OFTEN VIOLENT FELONIES FOR AN EXEMPTION AND POTENTIALLY ALLOW THESE INDIVIDUALS TO CARE FOR CHILDREN. THE BILL ALSO LIMITS THE DEPARTMENT'S ABILITY TO LOOK AT CONVICTIONS AND PATTERNS OF CONVICTIONS AS WAS DESCRIBED EARLIER. STILL FOR CRIMINAL CONVICTION FROM SIX YEARS OR TEN YEARS OR FIFTEEN YEARS AGO. COULD WOULD. PUT A CHILD AT RISK THEY'D HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO INITIALLY DENIED THAT IT INDIVIDUAL FROM BEING A CHILD CARE PROVIDER AND REQUIRE THAT INDIVIDUAL GO TO THE EXEMPTION PROCESS AND REQUEST A HEARING IF NECESSARY. AND IT FINALLY SEAT CDS THIS IS ABILITY TO LOOK AT ALL TYPES OF CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS BY ONLY ALLOWING CRIMES THAT ARE DIRECTLY AND. ADVERSELY RELATED CRIMES. WHEN A CHILD'S WELL BEING IS AT STAKE DSS SHOULD HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO TAKEN CAN. CONSIDERATION OF PERSONS IN FULL CRIMINAL HISTORY AND DETERMINED BASED ON THE SPECIFICS OF EACH CONVICTION IF THAT INDIVIDUAL COULD POSE A REST THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF A CHILD. AS PROPOSED THE BILL DOES IT MAKE MAJOR CHANGES TO THE PROCEDURE FOR LICENSING FOSTER FAMILY HOMES WEEK EXTRA WE SUPPORT THAT AM STRONGLY. BUT WE KNOW THAT ALL CHILDREN WHETHER THEY'RE CARED FOR IN A FOSTER HOME OR IN A CHILDCARE ARRANGEMENT DESERVE THAT SAME BACKGROUND CHECK PROTECTIONS. THEY CURRENTLY RECEIVE. UNDER LAW. SO AS WE SAID WE AND. WITH THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS WE REALLY WE SUPPORT AND THE IDEA OF REVIEWING AND IMPROVING INCREASING THE EFFICIENCY AND TIMELINESS OF THE EXEMPTION PROCESS. AND WE ENCOURAGE THE DEVELOPMENT OF A WORK GROUP OR TASK FORCE AND THAT INCLUDES ALL STAKEHOLDER GROUPS CHILDREN'S RIGHTS GROUPS PARENT ADVOCACY GROUPS AND EVERY STAKEHOLDER IN THIS PROCESS. UP TO BE ABLE TO COME UP WITH THE SOLUTION. AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR DSS WHICH COULD INCLUDE CHANGES TO THE EVALUATOR MAP MANUAL TRAINING PROCEDURES OR OTHER CHANGES UP TO AND INCLUDING STATUTE. THANK YOU I'M AND JUST AGAIN FOR CLARIFICATION. THOUGH THE REASON THAT WE. DECIDED TO PUT PUT IT THERE WAS BECAUSE WE HAD NOT HAD A CONVERSATION WITH THE SS AND SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE EXPECTING AND SO. ASSEMBLY MEMBER. HOLDEN. ASSURED ME THAT HE THAT THAT WOULD HAPPEN AND SO FOR WHATEVER REASON THE CONVERSATION. DSS NEVER CAME TO THE TABLE AND SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ADDRESS THAT WITH THEM WITH ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS ON THE ACTIVE PEOPLE SO THINK I APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS. AND IF I COULD THE THE ISSUES THAT TO RELATE YOU REFERRED TO ON THE NOT EXCEPT WE. I THINK IT'S OUR INTENTION TO ACCEPT THAT AND TO THE BILL TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE CRIMES ARE. ARE YOU ARE NOT OR MEASURED APPROPRIATELY AND SO. EVEN WERE ON THE SAME PAGE I THINK THAT. THANK THANK YOU ANY OTHER. I AM LAURIE FURSTENFELD A NAME AS SENIOR STAFF ATTORNEY AT THE CHILDCARE LAW CENTER. AND AT LAKE THE RESOURCE AND REFERRAL NETWORK WERE IN STRONG SUPPORTER OF THE INTENT OF EP THIRTY THREE NINE TO CREATE A MORE EQUITABLE. PROCESS FOR PERSONS WITH AN ARRESTOR CONVICTION HAS STRAIGHT DO HAVE A FAIR CHANCE OF EMPLOYMENT AND THAT THEY ARE NOT. UNFAIRLY DISCRIMINATED AGAINST AND WE HAVE ALSO SUBMITTED A LETTER OF OPPOSITION AND LASTS AMENDED. I'M BASED ON THE CURRENT LANGUAGE OF THE BILL. ON WE DO FEEL THAT THIS THE AT THIS INTENT ALSO NEEDS TO BE BALANCED BUT THE RIGHTS OF CHILDREN TO BE CARED FOR. AND IT'S SAFE ENVIRONMENT WHICH IS WHY WE HAVE OPPOSE THE BILL UNLESS AMENDED. I'M CALIFORNIA CURRENTLY RANKS AT THE VERY BOTTOM FOR OVERSIGHT OF CHILDCARE LICENSE FACILITIES COMPARED TO OTHER STATES. AND THE FEDERAL OFFICE OF CHILDCARE HAS WORKED ARGUE WESLEY OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS TO REALLY IMPROVE THE HEALTH AND SAFETY STANDARDS OF CHILDCARE. ACROSS THE UNITED STATES AND CHILDCARE LISTENER HAS BEEN I'M AN ACTIVE PARTICIPANT IN SUPPORTING THESE MEASURES TO INCREASE THE HEALTH AND SAFETY. WE COULDN'T FIND ANY DATA AND THE AGENCY SPONSOR CAN OFFER ANY RESEARCH THAT WOULD. GUARANTEE THAT ROOM I'M SCALING BACK THE CRIMINAL I'M BACKGROUND REQUIREMENTS WE KEEP CHILDREN JUST TO SAY FOR IF NOT SAFER AND. I'M I ALSO WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THAT ELIMINATING THE LIST OF NON ACCEPTABLE CRIMES ALSO COMPLEX. BUT THE FEDERAL FUNDING CONDITIONS UNDER THE CHILD TO DAYCARE. THE CHILDCARE DEVELOPMENT BLOCK GRANT OUR LARGEST SOURCE OF FUNDING FOR CHILDCARE IN THE STATE AND ALSO PROVISIONS OF THAT TITLE FOR E. FUNDING SOURCE FOR CHILDCARE. YOU THINK YOU ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. PATRICE ANDERSON WITH THE ARE CAN YOU SEE P. CALIFORNIA CAR RACING WE DON'T HAVE AN OFFICIAL POSITION ON THE BILL AT THIS TIME. BUT WE HAVE TALKED TO THE AUTHORS OFFICE ABOUT OUR CONCERNS AND LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING THOSE CONVERSATIONS TO ENSURE THAT. ALL VULNERABLE POPULATIONS OF PROTECTIVENESS THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ANY OTHERS GET HEARING ANOTHER BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS ASSEMBLYMEMBER REYES. ASSEMBLYMEMBER HOLDEN FIRST I WANT TO THANK YOU AND THE SPONSORS OF THE BILL. YOU'RE WORKING ON A REALLY COMPLEX BUT VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE. YOU AND I ARE JOINT AUTHORS ON A. B. ONE ZERO ZERO EIGHT FROM LAST YEAR. AND I'M ALSO OFFERING A BILL. SPONSORED BY THE SAME COALITION AND A WORKING ON THE SAME SUBJECT. SECOND CHANCES. WITHOUT A DOUBT I'M FROM BELIEVER IN SECOND CHANCES. I MENTIONED TO YOU EARLIER THAT. I I THINK THAT. IT IS A REALLY IMPORTANT THAT THE PROVISIONS IN THE BILL ADEQUATELY PROTECT THE VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES. PACIFIC WITH CHILDREN AS WAS BEING TALKED ABOUT. I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THE LANGUAGE REGARDING THE VIOLENT FELONIES AND I KNOW THAT YOU'RE ALREADY WORKING ON THAT. I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU'RE GOING TO BE WORKING FURTHER OWN THE BILL'S PROVISIONS AND I WANT TO OFFER MY OFFICE. AS A RESOURCE TO YOU AS YOU CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE COMMITTEE AND THE STAKEHOLDERS. I WANT. TO ENSURE THAT THE OPPOSITION'S CONCERNS REGARDING VULNERABLE INDIVIDUALS. PACIFIC WE THE CHILDREN ARE DRESSED SO THAT WE GET THE BILL RIGHT AND I'VE COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH YOU BECAUSE. THIS IS PART OF AN ENTIRE COALITION TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DO PROVIDE SECOND CHANCES. THANK. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. BUT CHOI. THAT I SHARE THOSE LAWS SAYING MCCARTY CERN ARE. IS ALWAYS OF COURSE IN CRIMES. WHEN WE. BUT ALLOW. THE. EMPLOYMENT POURED. ABOVE AND BEYOND THE FIVE YEARS. WITH THAT THERE HAS BEEN NO I THINK I HEARD THAT THERE'S NO. STATISTICS HERE IS THAT. TRUE THAT. PREVIEWS SO. THREATEN OFFENDERS SO IT WOULD NOT THAT RECALL MEET THE SAME INNER. CRIME. DO YOU HAVE ANY SUCH DATA. THAT THE BY EXTENDING FIVE YEARS IS NOT A MAGICAL. UP PERIOD. NOW THERE IS TO MORE FOR HUMAN CHARACTER WILL A TENDENCY. SOME MAY CHANGE. SOME MAY STILL RETAIN. ITS A FIVE YEARS OR SIX YEARS. SO HOW CAN YOU BE SURE JUST BECAUSE SO WHY NOT THREE YEARS WHY NOT TWO YEARS. SO WHERE DID YOU COME BOB COME UP WITH A FIVE YEAR. PERIOD. WHAT WE'RE WORKING OFF OF THE? STANDARD WHICH IS SEVEN YEARS. FOR PRIVATE. INSTITUTION SO WERE. WERE WERE SORT OF LOOKING AT THAT IT'S USING THAT AS SORT OF A BENCHMARK. I THINK IT'S WHAT WE'RE ALSO TRY LOOKING FOR DSS TO DO IS TO START TO. COLLECT DATA SO THAT WILL HAVE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF HOW. AFFECTED COMMUNITIES AND INDIVIDUALS AND CHARACTER OR PEOPLE THAT WE NEED TO ACTUALLY HAVE THAT DATA TO HELP US. WE HAD IT WOULD MAKE THIS A LITTLE BIT EASIER PRESENTATION THIS AFTERNOON BUT I THINK WHAT WE'RE HOPING IS THAT. ARE WE CAN HAVE THEM MOVE FORWARD GOING FORWARD. TO. LOOK AT THE VARIOUS DEMOGRAPHIC. CHARACTERISTICS AND HELP TO START TO PROFILE. AYE IF YOU WILL. HOW? THESE POPULATIONS ARE IMPACTED AND WE'RE USING A STANDARD ON THE SEVEN YEARS TO THAT OR USE IT FIVE YEARS BUT SEVEN YEARS AS THE. HEAD OF THE BENCHMARK BUT. TURN TO THE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTION AFTER CHOI JUST TO TALK ABOUT IT FROM THE EARLIER SIDE OF THINGS. THERE'S ACTUALLY DATA THAT SUPPORTS THAT TEN MONTHS AFTER RECIDIVISM. YOUR RATE OF RECIDIVISM DROPS BY HALF A NOTS SUBSEQUENTLY CONTINUES TO DROP EVERY TEN MONTHS. THERE'S ALSO DATA FROM THE NATIONAL PLAN A LOT PROJECT THAT STATE SIX TO SEVEN YEARS AFTER CONTACT WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT WHERE YOU HAVE HAD NO CONTACT IN THE INTERVENING YEARS. YOUR RECORD IS THE SAME AS SOMEBODY ELSE WITHOUT A CRIMINAL CONVICTION AND THE RATE OF RECIDIVISM IS MINIMAL IN COMPARISON TO SOMEONE WITHOUT A RECORD. I'M AS I'M ASSEMBLY MEMBER HOLDEN MENTIONED THERE ARE PROTECTIONS UNDER. THE LABOR CODE PROVISIONS WHERE I'VE EMPLOYERS CANNOT CONSIDER CONVICTIONS PAST SEVEN YEARS THERE'S ALSO. WASH UP PERIODS IN THE IN HOME SUPPORTIVE SERVICES. LAWS WHERE THEY LIMITED TO TEN YEARS SO WE SETTLED ON FIVE IS SOMETHING THAT FELT LIKE IT WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF SEVEN YEARS. BUT ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT THERE'S DATA THAT SUPPORTS THAT TEN MONTHS AFTER A CONVICTION IF SOMEBODY HAS NOT RECIPROCATED THEIR RATE OF RECIDIVISM HAS ALREADY DROPPED FIFTY PERCENT AND WILL CONTINUE TO DROP. AND JUST TO NOTE THAT HAVING EMPLOYMENT IS THE STRONGEST PREDICTOR. TO. FURTHER PREVENTING RECIDIVISM. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. ASSEMBLYMEMBER THURMAN. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU TO THE AUTHOR. YEAH I I THINK THIS IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO I I WAS JUST HOPING THAT YOU COULD CLARIFY I HAD TROUBLE FOLLOWING THE. WE DO ANY AMENDMENTS FOR NOT DOING THE AMENDMENT SO WHAT THAT REALLY MEANS AND YOU KNOW WE'RE STILL WORKING ON IT. I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT THAT REFERS TO. AND AND I'M JUST WONDERING IF WE COULD JUST IF SOMEONE COULD JUST SAY. I'M KIND OF A SIMPLE PURSUITS MEDINA SAY IN PLAIN LANGUAGE THAT. IT. GOES AMENDMENTS SPEAK TO IF A PERSON HAS EVER COMMITTED A CRIME THAT WAS RELATED TO THE HARMING OF A CHILD. IS THAT WOULD THAT. DISQUALIFY THEM FROM THIS CONSIDERATION OR IS THAT SOMETHING THAT COULDN'T BE REVIEWED UP PERHAPS YOU COULD PROVIDE SOME CLARITY SO THAT.

A LOT OF THIS CONVERSATION HICH WE HAVE NOT HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO. I THINK I'M UP TO SPEED IF I IF I HEARD IT TELL ME IF I HEARD IT WRONG BUT WHAT YOU SAID YOU KNOW WORK WITH THE EXCESS DSS AND. THE COMMITTEE STAFF IN THE CHAIR AND THAT YOUR INTENT IS TO ARTICULATE SOME TYPE OF A POLICY THAT IF THE CRIME WAS SPECIFICALLY COMMITTED TO ENDANGERMENT ARE HARMING A CHILD.

MADAM CHAIR AND COMMITTEE. MEMBERS. I'M HERE TODAY TO PRESENT EIGHTY B. THE NINETEEN NINETY. A BILL THAT WILL ENSURE AFFORDABLE AND INTEGRATED HOUSING OPTIONS FOR OUR INTELLECTUAL AND DEVELOPMENT LEAD DISABLED COMMUNITIES. AS YOU ARE AWARE THE STATE'S REMAINING DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS. WILL BE CLOSING BY TWENTY TWENTY ONE. AS SUCH THE CURRENT RESIDENTS OF THE CENTERS WILL BE TRANSITIONING. INTO OUR COMMUNITIES AND ARE IN NEED OF HOUSING OPTIONS. IN ADDITION MANY AT ALL REGIONAL CENTER CLIENTS CURRENTLY LIVING IN THE COMMUNITY ALSO STRUGGLE TO FIND AFFORDABLE AND INDEPENDENT HOUSING OPTIONS. THE VAST MAJORITY OF ADULT RESULTS IN OUR CLIENTS RELY SOLELY ON SSI OR SSB. FOR THEIR INCOME AT A MAXIMUM OF NINE HUNDRED ELEVEN DOLLARS PER MONTH. AVERAGE RATE FOOD. HEALTHCARE COSTS EXEDRA. OFTEN EXCEED THIS AMOUNT. THIS PRESENTS REGIONAL CENTER CLIENTS WITH FEW OPTIONS FOR INDEPENDENT HOUSING. HOUSING AS ONE OF THE GREATEST CHALLENGES FACING OUR STATE. AND THE SITCH WAY XIN IS EXPRESSLY DIRE. FOR. OUR PEOPLE WITH. S. ABILITIES. WHO OFTEN RELY AGAIN ON SSI OR S. SP AS THEIR ONLY SOURCE OF INCOME? THROUGHOUT THE STATE. COMMUNITY PROVIDERS ARE REPORTING THAT NEAR. AND POSSIBILITY OF SECURING HOUSING FOR THEIR CLIENTS. AS WELL AS. THE DEVASTATING STORIES OF INDIVIDUALS. WHO ALREADY HAVE HOUSING? WHO HAVE ALREADY LOST THEIR HOUSING? DUE TO ITS INCREASE PRICES. AS SUCH. MORE MUST BE DONE TO PROVIDE THESE INDIVIDUALS WITH THE OPTION TO LIVE INDEPENDENTLY WITHIN OUR COMMUNITIES. CURRENTLY A PORTION OF THE SITE AND FARED VIEW DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER. IS RUN AS HARD WILL VILLAGE. A MIX RESIDENT COMMUNITY WHICH SERVES. A. MANDATED PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. THIS MODEL HAS PROVEN EXTREMELY EFFECTIVE AT PROVIDING HOUSING OPTIONS FOR INDIVIDUALS TRANSFERRING OUT OF THE STATE'S REMAINING DC'S. AS WELL AS INDIVIDUALS ALREADY AND THE COMMUNITY IN NEED OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING. FURTHERMORE THE SITES HAVE BEEN FOUND TO GENERATE SURPLUS REVENUES. WHICH ARE ULTIMATELY FUNNELED BACK TO THE DEPARTMENT OF DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES DDS. TO INCREASE SERVICES FOR PEOPLE WITH INTELLECTUAL AND DEVELOPMENTAL. S. ABILITIES. UTILIZING AN EXPANDING UPON THIS MODEL. AB NINETEEN NINETY WILL ESTABLISH. CALIFORNIA INTEGRATED COMMUNITY THE LIVING PROGRAM WITHIN DTS. THIS PROGRAM WILL PROVIDE LOANS TO COVER THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE CONSTRUCTION AND PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH INTELLECTUAL AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. ULTIMATELY THIS BILL ENSURES THAT THE FUNDING CURRENTLY PROVIDED TO OUR INTELLECTUAL AND DEVELOPMENTAL. DISABLED HUMIDITY REMAINS WITH THE CLIENTS RATHER THAN RETURNING. TO THE GENERAL FUND. MEMBERS THIS IS KEY. WE CANNOT ALLOW THIS VITAL FUNDING TO BE TAKEN AWAY. FOR MORE DISABLED COMMUNITY. RATHER WE SHOULD PROACTIVELY CAPTURE AND UTILIZE THESE FUNDS TO ENSURE ADEQUATE ACCESS TO HOUSING OPTIONS. FOR OUR DISABLED COMMUNITY. ALONG WITH. RESIDENTS CURRENTLY IN NEED OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING OPTIONS. WITHOUT THE PROACTIVE APPROACH OUTLINED WITHIN THIS MEASURE THESE INDIVIDUALS WILL CONTINUE TO BE OSTRACIZED. WITH ME TODAY MISS PATTY UP LINGER. WHEN HOUSING NOW AND THE WIND AMID HOUSING ALLIANCE PATTY. I THINK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY MADAM CHAIRMAN COMMITTEE. PADDY UP LONGER AND I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF HOUSING NOW WERE LOCAL COULD RECOVER TEN COUNTIES AND PROVIDE HOUSING RESOURCES FOR THIS PARTICULAR POPULATION. WERE ALSO A MEMBER OF THE LANTERN IN HOUSING ALLIANCE WHICH IS A STATEWIDE GROUP THAT DOES HOUSING FOR PEOPLE WITH IDT. AND IT. YOU YOU HEAR IT THE HOUSING CRISIS IT IS TREMENDOUS OUT THERE THESE FOLKS IN THIS BOOK ON LEGACY. I WAS AT THE CALIFORNIA SUPPORTED LIVING NETWORKING PROVIDED A THREE HOUSING SESSIONS FOR PEOPLE IN ATTENDANCE THESE ARE LUCKY ONES LUCKY FOLKS THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN ABLE TO. AVOID AN INSTITUTION AND LIVE IN THE COMMUNITY BUT IT'S REALLY IT'S REALLY REALLY GETTING VERY DIFFICULT AND I CAN. BUT I CAN PAINT THE PICTURE OF THE HOUSING MARKET JUST IN JANUARY I WAS PREPARING FOR AN INTERVIEW AND I TALKED AS A HOUSING SPECIALIST I'M ALSO HOUSING SPECIALIST FOR THIS POPULATION. I TALKED TO AN AGENCY AND THEY SAID WELL PATTY ABOUT FIFTEEN PEOPLE THAT NEED TO FIND HOUSING BY MARCH THE REASON IS BECAUSE THE LANDLORDS MAYBE APARTMENTS ARE UNDER NEW OWNERSHIP. NO LONGER WILL ACCEPT THE HOUSING CHOICE VOUCHER PROGRAM AS WELL AS PEOPLE ARE PRICED OUT SPECIALLY IN SACRAMENTO WE HAD THE HIGHS HIRES RISING RENTS IN THE. NATION LAST YEAR SO PEOPLE WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES SHOULD BE ABLE TO LIVE IN THE COMMUNITY I HAVE AN EXAMPLE OF A PERSON. THAT CINEMAS ON THE WAY BEING CLOSED DOWN CINEMA DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER IN THIS INDIVIDUAL WHO WANTS TO LIVE IN NEEDS TO MOVE INTO THE COMMUNITY WERE HAVING TROUBLE WE'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR MONTHS TO TRY AND FIND APPROPRIATE HOUSING IN THE COMMUNITY FOR HIM. LIKE A ASSEMBLY MEMBER MENTIONED THIS MOST PEOPLE THAT WE TRY TO FIND HOUSING FOR OUR AND SUPPLEMENTAL SECURITY INCOME NINE HUNDRED DOLLARS JUST IN SACRAMENTO SACRAMENTO COUNTY A ONE BEDROOM IS NINE HUNDRED AND SIXTEEN DOLLARS. IF YOU DON'T HAVE SOME SORT OF SUBSIDIZED HOUSING YOU'RE NOT GOING TO MAKE IT IN THE COMMUNITY THERE'S A LOT OF COMPETITION FOR THESE RESOURCES THE VERY LIMITED RESOURCES THAT WE HAVE. THAT SUBSIDIZED HOUSING WHETHER IT'S HOUSING CHOICE VOUCHERS OR TAX CREDIT PROPERTIES ARE BOND HOUSING OR OTHER SUBSIDIZED HOUSING THAT'S DEEPLY SUBSIDIZE FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE. EXTREMELY LOW INCOME THAT'S WHAT WE NEED THIS MONEY HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED FOR PEOPLE WITH INTELLECTUAL DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES AND AS THESE DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS CLOSE THE MONEY. SHOULD FOLLOW THESE INDIVIDUALS INTO THE COMMUNITY TO PROVIDE APPROPRIATE COMMUNITY RESOURCES FOR THEM AS FAR AS THEIR HOUSING IS CONCERNED SO. AND I THINK THAT WE CAN LEVERAGE SOME OF THIS FUNDS TO. UP MARY WITH THE TAX CREDITS AND AND MAKE IT COMPETITIVE SO THAT WE GET MORE OF HOUSING SET ASIDE FOR THIS POPULATION EVEN NO PLACE LIKE HOME MONEY THAT'S FOR PEOPLE MENTAL ILLNESS. AND PEOPLE WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE A MENTAL ILLNESS SO WE NEED FUNDING AND WE NEED HOUSING NOW AND I ASK YOU RESPECTFULLY FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

HERE WITH ME TODAY IS ANGIE SCHWARTZ A WITH THE ALLIANCE FOR CHILDREN'S RIGHTS AND CARE GIVERS AND SELENA ALVAREZ WHO CAN BOTH TESTIFY ABOUT HOW PROBLEMATIC. THESE DELAYS HAVE BEEN FOR FAMILIES AND HOW GREAT OF A NEED THERE IS TO INITIATE FUNDING AT THE TIME OF POLICEMEN. OKAY I. THANKS FOR HAVING ME. GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS SELENA ALVAREZ AND I LIVE IN SACRAMENTO CALIFORNIA. ON MARCH SEVENTH TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN AT ELEVEN FORTY FIVE PM MY WIFE AND I RECEIVED EMERGENCY PLACEMENT EVER THREE NIECES AND NEPHEWS. AGES SIX ELEVEN AND FIFTEEN THE CHILDREN ARRIVED AT HER HOME WITH ONLY THEIR SCHOOL BAGS IN ONE BAG OF CLOTHING THEY ARE IF A WORKER TOLD US SHE WOULD START THE PROCESS FOR US TO APPLY FOR YOLO COUNTY FOR CAL WORKS IS NOT NEEDY RELATIVES AS WE WERE NOT YET ARE IFFY APPROVED. TURNED OUT THAT INFORMATION WAS INCORRECT SINCE WE LIVE IN SACRAMENTO EVEN THE PLACEMENT IN THE CHILDREN SERVICES WERE FROM YELLOW COUNTY. A MONTH LATER WE WERE TOLD TO APPLY HONOR ON IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY WHICH WE DID AND WE DID NOT RECEIVE ANY RICHER PAYMENT FOR THE FIRST MONTH. WE STARTED OUR BE PROCESSED THE FOLLOWING WEEK OF PLACEMENT APPETITE MILLER COUNTY HAVE THIRTY HOUR TRAINING REQUIREMENT. WHICH WE COMPLETED. IN ADDITION TO OUR SUPER CLASS AND. APPLICATION OF LIFE CAN BE COMPLETED ALL ABOUT WITHIN SIX WEEKS SIX WEEKS. AFTER THAT WE WAITED AND WAITED FOR WHAT FELT LIKE FOREVER THERAPY THE RFA WORKER AT THE TIME WAS EXTREMELY SWAMPED. IT TOOK ABOUT THREE MONTHS FOR ME TO HAVE MY IN PERSON INTERVIEW AND ANOTHER MONTH FOR MY WIFE TO HAVE HERS. WE'RE EVENTUALLY APPROVED IN THE LAST WEEK OF SEPTEMBER SIX MONTHS AFTER PLACEMENT AND WE RECEIVED OUR FIRST PAYMENT IN MID OCTOBER. TAKING IN THREE CHILDREN FROM KINDERGARTEN TO MINE TH GRADE IS A HUGE FINANCIAL AND PERSONAL UNDERTAKING. THE KIDS WERE WORRIED THAT THEY WOULD HAVE TO CHANGE SCHOOLS BUT WE ASSURED THEM THEY WOULD NOT. LUCKILY I WORKED IN WOODLAND SO I WOULD TAKE THE KIDS TO TAKING THE KIDS TO SCHOOL DAVIS WASN'T COMPLETELY OUT OF THE WAY FOR ME. I DID NOTICE THAT MY GASOLINE BILL HAS DOUBLED. MY WIFE AND I HAD TO TAKE MANY FINANCIAL SACRIFICE HAD TO MAKE MANY SACRIFICES AND TAKE TIME OFF FROM WORK IN ORDER TO SUPPORT PITCHED THREE CHILDREN. LIVING WITH US MY WIFE DECIDED TO TAKE FAMILY MEDICAL LEAVE ACT IN MID MARCH FOR THE MAXIMUM OF THREE MONTHS TO HELP ENSURE THE CHILDREN SUCCESSFUL TRANSITION INTO OUR HOME. HOWEVER FMLA ONLY PAYS ABOUT FIFTY PERCENT OF YOUR EARNINGS SO HER PAYMENTS FOR LOW. I'M LUCKY ENOUGH TO WORK FOR A NONPROFIT THAT VALUES FAMILY TIME SO I WAS ABLE TO TAKE OFF. AND USE MY SICK TIME TO ACCOMMODATE FOR THE CHILDREN'S APPOINTMENTS TWICE WEEKLY VISITS THERAPY APPOINTMENTS MEDICAL DENTAL AND COURT DATES. ALTHOUGH WE MADE IT WORK IT WASN'T WITHOUT A FINANCIAL TOLL. BEING NOT THE YOUNGEST OF THE KINDERGARTEN AND ONLY WENT TO SCHOOL FROM ELEVEN AM TO THREE PM. THIS PROVED TO BE A BIG CHALLENGE. WE WERE TOLD THAT THE CHILDCARE SUBSIDY HAD RUN OUT FOR THE FISCAL YEAR SO WE WOULD NEED TO FIGURE OUT SOMETHING ELSE ON OUR OWN AND PAY FOR CHILDCARE OUT OF POCKET. THE BEFORE AND AFTER SCHOOL CARE WAS OUTRAGEOUSLY EXPENSIVE SO WE OPTED FOR THE MORNING ONLY CARE THREE DAYS A WEEK.

TAKING PLACEMENT OF A CHILD WHO HAS ALREADY UNDERGONE OCCURRENCES OF ABUSE NEGLECT ON AN EMERGENCY BASIS WHAT OUT FOSTER CARE FUNDING PUTS TREMENDOUS FINANCIAL STRAIN. ON RELATIVES AND NON EXTENDED FAMILY MEMBERS. WHO ARE? TO ACCEPT THESE CHILDREN AS EMERGENCY PLACEMENT. SAY THAT'S A LONG SENTENCE SORRY.
