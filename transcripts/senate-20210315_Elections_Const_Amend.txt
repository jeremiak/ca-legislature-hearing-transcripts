SB FIVE A THREE IS ALL ABOUT TRANSPARENCY. IN QUALIFYING BUT WE KNOW WORK FROM THE REMEMBER TWENTY TWENTY ELECTION. IN LOSS TO PRESIDENTIAL CYCLES ARE STATUS GONE FROM LESS THAN 60% VOTING BY MAIL TO ME 87% VOTING BY NOW. THE PERSON OVER TWENTY TWENTY ELECTION YOU KNOW CLEAR STATEWIDE STANDARDS FOR VALUE ANY SIGNATURES. IN A REPORT PUBLISHED LAST SPRING STUDENTS A STANFORD LAW IDENTIFIED SIGNIFICANT DISPARITIES FROM COUNTY TO COUNTY AND HOW THEY EVALUATE SIGNATURES AND CURED CHALLENGE MAIL ABOUT. NUMBER PROJECTED MAIL IN BALLOTS TO PASS A HUNDRED THOUSAND IN THE MARCH TWENTY TWENTY PRIMARY ABOUT ONE POINT 5% THE BALLOT. THE SECULAR STATE ISSUED EMERGENCY REGULATIONS TO STANDARDIZE SIGNATURE VERIFICATION. BUT WAS FOR THE NOVEMBER TWENTY TWENTY JIM ELECTION ONLY. AND WHAT ABOUT REJECTION RATE MARKEDLY DECLINED THE REMAINS ARE SCHEDULE VARIABILITY ACROSS COUNTY LINES. TO SB FIVE OH THREE CODIFIES WE LEARNED FROM TWENTY TWENTY ENSURES A COUNTIES ACROSS THE STATE REGION THE SAME UNIFORM PRACTICES. FOR SIGNATURE ASSESSMENT AND REPORTING REJECTIONS. JOHN SIGNATURES DISPROPORTIONATELY PACKED MOST REBEL KIND OF THE MOST WONDERFUL CALIFORNIANS. THOSE LIMITED ENGLISH PROFICIENCY DISABILITIES FIRST TIME VOTERS AGING VOTERS. AND VOTERS OF COLOR. SB FIVE A THREE GIVES CONFIDENCE TO ALL CALIFORNIANS THAT THEIR VOTES ARE COUNTED. I THINK THE CHAIR THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THE THOUGHTFUL ANALYSIS I COMMIT TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE CHAIR AND STAFF A BETTER CLARIFYING THE STANDARD FOR SIGNATURE VERIFICATION. AS SUGGESTED ON PAGE EIGHT THE COMMITTEE NOW SAYS. ALEX ARE EXPECT TO ASK YOUR AYE VOTE WHEN SB FIVE OH THREE. I WON WITH MISTER CHARICE BY ON THE PHONE TO TEST IN SUPPORT OF THE MEASURE.

YES HELLO THIS IS ERIC HARRIS CAN YOU HEAR ME WE CANISTER HARRIS PLEASE PROCEED. THANK YOU SO MUCH MY NAME IS ERIC HARRIS AND I'M THE DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC POLICY AT DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA THANK YOU TO THE CHAIR AND MEMBERS FOR HAVE LETTING YOU SPEAK THIS MORNING. SB FIFTY FIVE OH THREE SETS OUT COMMON SENSE REQUIREMENTS FOR SIGNATURE VERIFICATION THAT ARE GOOD FOR ALL VOTERS AND CODIFIES MANY OF THE BEST PRACTICES. IN THE SECRETARY OF STATE CURRENT REGULATIONS FOR COUNTY ELECTIONS OFFICIALS FONG COMPARING SIGNATURES. VOTERS WITH DISABILITIES ARE MORE LIKELY TO HAVE THEIR SIGNATURES REJECTED. DUE TO MISMATCHES. BECAUSE VOTERS WITHDISABILITIES. INST HAVE SIGNATURES THAT CANGE OVER TIME FOR STRUGGLE TO CREATE A SEEMINGLY IDENTICAL SIGNATURE. IN ADDITION TO VOTERS WITH DISABILITIES AGING VOTERS AND FIRST TIME VOTERS WILL BENEFIT FROM SB FIVE OH THREE. THIS BILL ESTABLISHES THAT AN EXACT MATCH IS NOT REQUIRED AND CREATES A PRESUMPTION THAT THE SIGNATURE IS THE VOTERS. THE BILL ALSO REQUIRES THE REVIEWERS SHE USED THE REGULATIONS AND THESE REGULATIONS OVERALL ARE VERY pINTERESTS OF THE VOTERS IN MY- VOTING RIGHTS ADVOCATES INCLUDING DRC RECOMMEND COMMENTED. ON THE DRAFT REGULATIONS THAT AND WE'RE PLEASED WITH THE OUTCOME. THESE REGULATIONS ALLOW SIGNATURE REVIEWERS HAVE DIRECTLY TAKE INTO ACCOUNT WHETHER A DISABILITY HAVE IMPACTED THE VOTER SIGNATURE AND OTHER FACTORS LIKE TREMBLING AND SHAKING. OVERALL THIS BILL IS GOOD FOR VOTERS WITH DISABILITIES. ANOTHER BENEFIT OF THIS BILL IS THAT IT EMPOWERS COUNTY ELECT COUNTY ELECTION OFFICIALS TO BETTER REACH OUT TO VOTERS WITH MISMATCHED SIGNATURES. CURRENTLY VOTERS ARE MAILED THE NOTICE THAT THEIR SIGNATURES MISMATCHED OR MISSING OR MISSING. THIS IS GOOD BUT- BUT MAIL IS NOT THE ONLY WAY TO REACH OUT TO THE SUPPORTERS OF DISABILITY. THIS BILL ALLOWS COUNTY ELECTION OFFICIALS TO USE OTHER FORMS IN A VOTERS FILED NEXT TO CONTACT THEM. A PHONE CALL OR AN EMAIL IS MUCH MORE LIKELY TO REACH VOTERS WITH DISABILITIES. AGAIN THIS BILL WOULD BE VERY GOOD FOR ALL VOTERS ESPECIALLY VOTERS WITH DISABILITIES AND CREWS UP THE VOTING AND CREWS WORKED FOR ALL. THANK YOU TO THE AUTHOR THANK YOU TO THE CHAIR AND THANK YOU TO ALL THE MEMBERS. OF THIS COMMITTEE PLEASE WELL I ON THIS BILL THANK YOU.

VOTERS ASK FOR REASSURANCE THAT THEIR VOTE BY MAIL BALLOT WOULD BE STAY FROM NEUTRALIZATION BY ILLEGITIMATELY CAST BALLOTS AND THE SECRETARY OF STATE ISSUE VERY HIGHLY PUBLICIZED REASSURANCES. CITING THE STATE'S CARDS SUCH AS WATERMARKING A BALLOT IN VIGOROUS SIGNATURE VERIFICATION AFTER BUT THEN ON SEPTEMBER EIGHTEENTH TWENTY TWENTY AFFECT STATE HANDED DOWN EMERGENCY REGULATIONS FOR THE NOVEMBER ELECTION HAVING TO DO WITH PROCESSING A VOTE BY MAIL BALLOT. AND CONTRARY TO THE STATE GUARDS PROMISED TO THE PUBLIC THE EMERGENCY REGULATIONS REQUIRED ACCEPTANCE OF NO CARD BALANCE. MULTIPLE BALLOTS STUFFED INTO A SINGLE ENVELOPE AND THEY ALSO PROVIDED LOOPHOLES FOR VIRTUALLY ALL SIGNATURES TO BE ACCEPTED MAKING EFFORT THAT LEGITIMATE SIGNATURE VERIFICATION- MAYOR SAM OF THESE REGULATIONS DID NOT PROTECT LEGITIMATE BALLOTS BUT RATHER THE ILLEGITIMATE ONE. LAWFUL BALLOTS ALREADY ENJOY SIGNIFICANT PROTECTION WHEN CURRENT LAW IS APPLIED ELECTIONS CODE THREE THOUSAND MANDATE THAT VOTE BY MAIL SIGNATURES BE LIBERALLY CONSTRUED IN FAVOR OF THE VOTER LIST PROVIDE GENEROUSLY WAY FOR VOTER ERROR. CURRENT CALIFORNIA LAW ALSO MANDATES THAT NO SIGNATURE AND THEREFORE IF THE COMPANY BALLOT CAN BE REJECTED WITHOUT FIRST CONTACTING THE VOTER AND OFFERING AN OPPORTUNITY TO SECURE THE SIGNATURE AND WE WOULD SUPPORT EXPANSION OF THE WAY IN WHICH THOSE VOTERS ARE CONTACTED. BUT THE CURING PROCESS PROTECT VOTERS WHOSE SIGNATURE HAS GENUINELY CHANGED ANSWERED BACK WHO FIND CARELESSLY AS A RESULT IN THE CURRENT SAYS THE IMPORTANCE OF PROVIDING SIGNATURE BUT IT ALSO COULD ALLEGE THE FISH LIVE. OR SCRUTINY WITHOUT OF DISTANT FRANCHISING LEGITIMATE VOTERS ARE STRICT AND UNIFICATION OF SIGNATURE. MATCHES VITAL TO ALLEGE AND- BECAUSE ABOUT FIVE VOTERS HAVE THE PER. OF THE VERY CHARING CROSS.

I HAVE SENATOR NEWMAN I HAVE CENTER NIELSEN SENATOR NEWMAN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRED AND- CHEN REBEKAH GOOD SHE SEEMS LIKE THE LEAST WE COULD DOES PROVIDE YOU WITH A PODIUM THIS MORNING- I. WANTED LETTERING. THIS YEAR EIGHT ANY LEGITIMATE EFFORT TO DETERMINE A BALLOTS LEGITIMACY IN WOULD PUT INDISCRIMINATE AND UNRESTRICTED POWER TO THE HANDS OF A SINGLE. ELECTED OFFICIAL- THE MANDATES ARE ANTITHETICAL TO DESTRUCTIVE OF ELECTION INTEGRITY. I OBVIOUSLY DON'T BELIEVE THAT BUT I'D LIKE TO GIVE YOU A CHANCE TO SPEAK TO THE RECORD- THAT'S A BROAD AND- VERY STRONG STATEMENT IF YOU WOULDN'T MIND RESPONDING. SURE THANK YOU CENTER NEWMAN. GET THIS KIND OF PRICE WE LEARNED WORKS IN THAT TWENTY TWENTY THIS IS ALL ABOUT TRANSPARENCY. FOR EXAMPLE PROVISIONS OF THE BALLOT THE BILL. RIGHT INSURE THAT CIRCULAR STATE PUBLISHED TIMELY REJECTED MAIL BALLOT REPORTS SAID CONSISTENT REJECTED BALLOT REASONS CULTURAL COUNTY TO REPORT ON THIS ACTUALLY WILL INCREASE THE TRANSPARENCY SO WE CAN SEE WHAT IS HAPPENING ALEXION SYSTEM. HI IT'S PREPAID ENVELOPES FOR CHALLENGING RETURNING CHALLENGE BALLOT AFFIDAVITS THAT'S THE LAST STEP IN OUR PROCESS WHERE PEOPLE NOW HAVE TO GO. FIND IT CAN'T DO IT THEMSELVES AND THEN AND TO ELIMINATE THAT FRICTION IS WE ACTUALLY INCREASED COMMUNICATION BETWEEN. THE THAT THE REGISTER TO COUNTIES AND THE INDIVIDUALS. WE LAY OUT OF THE COUNTY OFFICES MAY ISSUE TWO OR MORE. APRIL ELECTRIC NOTIFICATION NOTICES NOTICES ARE AFFIDAVITS FOR CHALLENGE BALLOTS TO VOTERS ANY USE DIFFERENT MODES OF CONTACTS ELECTRONIC AS WE HEARD FROM THE- WITNESS IN SUPPORT- ON THE- TO CALL FOUR TWO EMAIL ANYWAY SO THIS IS REALLY ALL ABOUT ENCOURAGING TRANSPARENCY. AND IT IS CLEAR THAT STAT THAT CHANGED FROM MATCH WE DON'T KNOW WE ALL SURGERY CHANGE OVER TIME FOR MATCH TO COMPARE. AND AGAIN THIS IS ALL THE SPIRIT OF WHAT WE LEARNED IN TWENTY TWENTY AFTER A HUNDRED THOUSAND BALLOTS WERE REJECTED. I APPRECIATE THAT SIR IN JUST BE CLEAR AND IT IT'S SORT OF INHERENT IN THIS PROCESS. TO THE EXTENT THAT COUNTIES RUN ELECTIONS IN CALIFORNIA- THE LEGISLATURE C. DELEGATES SIGNIFICAN RESPONSIBILITIES TO REGISTRATION AND THE STAFF BUT IT I DID. IT IS CLEAR I THINK AS YOU'VE MADE. A BY REMARKS WERE NOT ABDICATING ANY RESPONSIBILITY WERE SIMPLY CLARIFYING AND DELEGATES. YES AND AGAIN INCREASING THAT TRANSPARENCY INCREASING THE MODES OF COMMUNICATION THINK THAT LIMITING THE FRICTION BY PROVIDING THE PREPAID. ENVELOPE IN TERMS OF- THAT THAT CHALLENGE PROCESS SO REALLY ABOUT TRANSPARENCY AND I TRYING TO ELIMINATE. THE FRICTION AND THEN GREATLY THE ASSUMPTION OF THE CITRUS CORRECT AND THEN IF THERE IS REASON TO CHALLENGE IT THANK GOD WE CREATE THAT THAT TRANSPARENCY AND ELIMINATE THAT FRICTION. IN THAT COMMUNICATION WITH THE VOTERS. THANK YOU MR. THANK YOU SENATOR NEWMAN CENTER NIELSEN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I'M GOING TO OPPOSED. THE BILL OVER MANY YEARS WE HAVE SEEN MANY MANY ATTEMPTS TO DIMINISH THE VALIDITY OF THE VOTER ID VERIFICATION. THIS IS ANOTHER ONE THE SIGNATURE IS NOT ALL THAT DIFFICULT TO CONTEND WITH. AND I REJECT THOSE WHO CHARGE THAT THOSE WHO OPPOSE THESE KIND OF IDEAS ARE DOING VOTER SUPPRESSION NOT ABSOLUTELY REJECT THAT AND I'M GLAD TO SEE THAT THERE ARE NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA WHO ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE THE BALLOT INTEGRITY AND IT DOES HAVE ITS BEARING ON ELECTIONS. THANK YOU SENATOR NIELSEN SENATOR HERTZBERG. YEAH I WAS GONNA ASK YOU A QUESTION BUT IT. I JUST WANT TO TAKE A LOOK AT THIS IN THE LARGER CONTEXT OF WHAT THE GOVERNMENT DOES IN RELATIONSHIP. TO VALIDATING SIGNATURES NOW IT YEAH MY CORRECT TO ASSUME THAT I THINK I'M CORRECT FROM MY UNDERSTANDING- CENTER BECKER THAT WHEN YOU SIGN YOUR SIGNING INTO THE PENALTY OF PERJURY CORRECT YES OKAY SO WHEN YOU SIGN YOUR DRIVER'S LICENSE YOU SIDE OF THE PENALTY O PERJURY THAT'S THE LAW. WHEN YOU SIGNED A DECLARATION BEFORE COURT YOU SIDE UNDER THE PENALTY OF PERJURY WHEN YOU SIGN EVERY SINGLE DOCUMENT EXCEPT FOR RECORDED DOCUMENT IN THE REGISTRAR RECORDER'S DOCUMENT THE TRANSFERS. TITLE TO PROPERTY IT'S A SIGNATURE. AND NOW THE QUESTION BECOMES. WHEN YOU MAKE SUCH A STATEMENT WHICH HAS CAUSED HUGE CONSEQUENCES TO YOUR LIFE RIGHT IN EVERY CONTEXT OF EVERY DOCUMENT IF YOU'RE- TRYING TO APPLY FOR ANY GOVERNMENT SERVICE YOU MAKE ANY REPRESENTATION BUT FOR RECORDING. YOU HAVE A SIGNATURE SO THEN THE QUESTION BECOMES AYE YOUR DRIVER'S LICENSE OR ON THE- ANY OTHER APPLICATION FOR ANYTHING ELSE YOU APPLY FOR YOUR BUSINESS LICENSE ME IS A LAWYER GOING TO APPLY TO. A LICENSE TO PRACTICE LAW ORDERS AND ARCHITECT. DOES IT MEAN THAT THAT THEN AS A STANDARD THE QUESTION IS WHAT'S THE STANDARD. IN THE LAW WE'VE GOT BASIC STANDARDS IF YOU'RE GOING TO CONVICT SOMEBODY. OF MURDER YOU GOT IT YOU KNOW YOU GOTTA BE ABLE DO IT BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT THE QUESTION IS. THE QUESTION IS THE STANDARD HERE. IS BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT IS THE TO ME THE BIGGER ISSUE AS WE EXAMINE THIS WHETHER IT'S IN THE ELECTION CONTEXT OR- ANY OTHER KIND OF CONTEXT IN WHICH YOU WERE ENGAGED. YOU ARE SIGNING THE PENALTY OF PERJURY SO THERE'S CONSEQUENCES AND THEN THE QUESTION NOW IS WHO THE VALIDATOR WHO LOOKS AT THE SIGNATURE. THEY HAVE A STANDARD OF BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT THE QUESTION THAT I LOOK AT IN THIS MEASURE. IS AS A SOCIETY WHAT STANDARDS DO WE USE. UNDER THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES WHETHER IT'S A CRIMINAL PROCEEDING OR CIVIL PROCEEDING. BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT SUBSTANDARD BUT FOR CERTAIN VERY UNIQUE FELONIES. WHEN YOU'RE CONVICTING SOMEBODY SO TO ME. NO DIFFERENCE THAN CODIFYING WHAT IS THE UNDERLYING JURISPRUDENTIAL BASIS FOR EVERYTHING THAT WE DO AND IF YOU WERE SOMEBODY VIOLATES THE LAW IT WANTS TO SUFFER THE CONSEQUENCES SO BE IT SO. WHEN I LOOK AT THAT LARGER STANDARD APOLOGIES FOR GOING ALONG WITH IT JUST HITS ME LIKE A BRICK IN TERMS OF LOOKING AT ALL OF THE OTHER AREAS OF THE LAW IN WHICH PEOPLE ARE INTERFACING WITH THEIR GOVERNMENT. THIS JUST SIMPLY SETS A STANDARD CONSISTENT WITH. THAT JURISPRUDENTIAL PRACTICE SO I JUST WANTED TO UNLESS YOU THINK I'M WRONG IN TERMS OF DOING MORE HOMEWORK ON THIS. I LOOK AT THIS AND I DON'T SEE ANYTHING. OTHER THAN THAT IT AND WHY SHOULD THE STANDARD BE ANYTHING DIFFERENT THAN ANY OTHER STANDARD ESPECIALLY THE CRIMINAL CONTEXT ANOTHER CONTEXT. PLEASE ONE AT IT UNLESS YOU THINK I'M WRONG- CENTER BECKER I JUST WANT TO SHARE THOSE THOSE THINKING THAT THINKING HERE. YES NO I APPRECIATE THOSE COMMENTS AND AGREE WITH THEM AND I APPRECIATE THAT CENTER HERTZBERG. IS THERE A NIELSEN I APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS AS WELL- YOU KNOW WOULD KNOWN AS ALLEGING VOTER SUPPRESSION IN THOSE. BUT WHAT WE DISEASE WIDE VARIATION BETWEEN THE COUNTIES AND THAT'S BECAUSE IT WAS REALLY UNCLEAR. AND THIS IS ALL RELATIVELY NEW ESPECIALLY IN TERMS OF THE DRAMATIC INCREASE. IN MAIL IN BALLOTS SO I DO APPRECIATE YOUR CONCERN APPRECIATE THE CONCERNS RAISED- BUT AGAIN THIS IS ALL ABOUT REALLY INCREASING TRANSPARENCY YES WE DO CHANGE THE PRESUMPTION. AND CHANGE THAT FROM MATCH TO COMPARE BUT IT'S REALLY NOT INCREASING THAT COMMUNICATION BETWEEN. THE REGISTRAR AND THE INDIVIDUAL. THEN PACKER THANK YOU. YOUR WORK ON THIS LEGISLATION- WITH MY STAFF AND WITH ME APPRECIATED THE CONVERSATIONS THAT WE HAD. AND I- I APPRECIATE THE GOAL THAT YOU'VE ESTABLISHED IN THIS BILL WE WANT EVERY VOTE TO COUNT AT THE END OF THE DAY THAT'S REALLY WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO ENSURE. A HAPPENS AND I APPRECIATE THE WORK FROM THE STUDENTS AT STANFORD. AND LOOKING AT OUR ELECTIONS IN THE PAST TO. SEE WHETHER THAT'S HAPPENING AT AND THAT'S THAT THAT'S BEEN THE SPARK FOR. YOU WORK IN THIS AREA. I KNOW THAT. YOU KNOW WHEN I SIGNED MY DRIVER'S LICENSE YOU KNOW. FIVE YEARS AGO TEN YEARS AGO TWENTY YEARS AGO OR VOTER REGISTRATION APPLICATION THAT MY SIGNATURE IS NOT THE SAME. AND THAT A LOT OF US IN OUR DAILY LIFE. YOU KNOW GET REMEMBER THOSE CURSE OF COURSES AND SO WE'RE REALLY CAREFUL ABOUT THOSE **** IN THOSE JEEZ AND DISEASE IN MY CASE- BUT CERTAINLY AS THOSE LESSONS OF FATE IN OUR MEMORY. PERHAPS WEEK WE MOVE A LITTLE FASTER AND WRITING OUR NAME AND- IT POSES CHALLENGES BECAUSE THIS IS A HUMAN INTERPRETATION. THIS ISN'T A MACHINE INTERPRETATION AND ALTHOUGH I UNDERSTAND SOME OF THEM ARE USED TO. DO A QUICK SCREEN ON SOME OF THE STUFF- IT'S A IT'S A PERSON AND SO IT IS IN IT BUT IT YOU KNOW AND EVERY PERSON IN EVERY COUNTY MIGHT. LOOK AT SOMETHING A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENTLY AND SO I CERTAINLY APPRECIATE WHERE YOU'RE GOING WITH US AND I THINK THE EMERGENCY REGULATIONS THAT WERE ISSUED. BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE. A MERE MUCH OF WHAT YOU ARE TRYING TO DO IN THIS BILL. AND I THINK UP WITH THE IDEA THAT WE WANT EVERY VOTE TO COUNT AND THAT REALLY HAS TO BE AT. A HIGHER. THRESHOLD TO ELIMINATE SOMEONE'S VOICE THAN THEIR VOTE. I DO WANT TO ASK YOU THOUGH TO SPEAK TO THIS ISSUE OF BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT- IT'S A STANDARD THAT- CAN BE SUBJECT TO INTERPRETATION AND SO CAN YOU SPEAK TO. WHAT YOU THINK THAT MEANS AND WHAT THAT COMMUNICATES TO OUR FIFTY EIGHT COUNTY REGISTRARS. YES WELL I APPRECIATE THAT AND AGAIN I APPRECIATE. IT YOU BET YOUR GLAZER AND YOUR STAFF FOR WORKING- ON THEM THIS TO THIS BILL- WITH US. IN PARTICULARLY ON THIS APPOINTED AS I MENTION OPENING STATEMENT. I WILL WORK CONTINUE TO WORK WITH YOUR STAFF PARTICULARLY ON THIS POINT TO MAKE SURE. THAT IS CLEAR. ON THAT AGAIN TO US IT'S- WERE. YOU KNOW AGAIN IT'S ABOUT TRANSPARENCY RUSSIA CHANGING PRESUMPTION. THAT NONE FROM THE PRESUMPTION THAT IT'S REALLY INVALID TO PRESUMPTION OF THE SIGNATURES VALID. AND FOR THAT THEN TO FEEL LIKE BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT THAT- THAT- THAT IT'S INVALID IN THAT PROCESS THEN. OF CHALLENGING THE SIGNATURE SO. THAT'S REALLY WHAT IT'S ABOUT TO US IS KIND OF CRAZY THAT LARGER THRESHOLD. AND THIS IS THE PENLEE PERJURIOUS CENTER HERTZBERG. SAID ARE THAT ALL THAT ALREADY APPLIES. SO THIS IS REALLY ABOUT BEGIN CHANGING THAT THAT PRESUMPTION. AND WE'RE HAPPY TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH YOUR TEAM- FOR ANY CLARIFICATIONS ON US. NOT CREATE THAT TO SENATOR BECKER I DO THINK THAT THE- STANDARDS THAT THE- EMERGENCY ORDER. CREATED WHAT WE'RE A LITTLE BIT MORE SPECIFIC MMHM- IN TERMS OF DETERMINING THAT A SIGNATURE- WAS IT WAS VALID. I THINK THE PRESUMPTION OF COURSE WOULD BE THERE AS WELL. SO I LOOK FORWARD TO THAT THAT THAT CONVERSATION AS THE BILL. GOES FORWARD I WOULD NOTE THAT. WHEN YOU LOOK AT- THIS IS THE IMPORTANT BILL DON'T MISUNDERSTAND ME BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE CONTEXT OF ALL THOSE PEOPLE WHO VOTED IN. OUR ELECTIONS. THAT THE PERCENTAGE THAT WE'RE TRYING TO GET TO. IS A FRACTION- A HALF OF ONE PERCENT. NO THAT'S NOT INSIGNIFICANT IT'S A LOT OF PEOPLE AND SO WE'RE TRYING TO DO EVEN BETTER WHICH IS WHAT THE GOAL OF YOUR BILL AS- BUT I WOULD PUT IN CONTEXT THAT- THIS IS NOT. ABOUT TO TAKE OVER OF ELECTIONS OR WHATEVER ANYONE WANTS TO CHARACTERIZE SOMEHOW. THE ACTIONS OF THIS BILL- MIGHT HAVE ANY ANY IMPACT- AND IN DOING SO WITHOUT AYE I'LL SEE IF THERE'S ANY OTHER COMMITTEE COMMENTS SENATOR NIELSEN. THURMOND THANK YOU FOR THAT TO THE CONCERNED ABOUT BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT I'M VERY FAMILIAR WITH THAT THRESHOLD. IT CERTAINLY IS APPLICABLE TO CRIMINAL BEHAVIOR THERE IS A LIBERTY INTEREST AT STAKE. BUT IN THE CASE OF THESE. INCIDENCES HERE OF SIGNATURES. I DOUBT THERE ARE VERY MANY PROSECUTIONS THAT ANY SECTOR STAYS EVER FORWARDED TO AN ATTORNEY GENERAL I'D LIKE TO KNOW TE NUMBERS I'M SURE THERE ARE MINUSCULE. AND THAT AND THAT'S WHY I THINK THIS GOES A BIT FAR SO I'D- APPRECIATE THE AUTHORSHIP GOOD ACCEPTED PHILLIES TAKE A LOOK AT THAT VERY IMPORTANT VERY. OF BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT. THE CONSEQUENCES ARE VERY DIFFERENT TO- FOR THAT TYPE OF BEHAVIOR THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH. VERY GOOD AT COLLEAGUES ANYTHING FURTHER I'M GONNA ASK THE AUTHOR TO A CLOSE ON HIS BILL. OKAY CENTER BACKER THANK YOU APPRECIATE THE ROBUST DISCUSSION AND I WILL WE WILL CONTINUE TO LOOK AT THAT AND WORK WITH THE COMMITTEE TO FURTHER CLARIFY- IN WITH THAT DISCUSSION.

MISTER CHAIRMAN THIS IS NOT SUFFICIENT FOR ME TO BE DISPOSED OF OR- IN OPPOSITION BUT IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE. THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PAROLED AND DISCHARGED FROM PAROLE. THE SENTENCE IS NOT EXTINGUISHED IN MOST CASES UNTIL ONE IS DISCHARGED FORMALLY DISCHARGE I WOULD SUGGEST THE AUTHOR CONSIDERS IT MOVES ALONG ADDING THE WORD DISCHARGED FROM PAROLE THAT MEANS THEIR DEBT TO SOCIETY HAS BEEN COMPLETELY EXTINGUISHED BUT PAROLE DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN THAT. THANK YOU CENTER NIELSEN SENATOR NEWMAN. AND THINK WITH YOUR HEAD I DON'T SOMETHING IS DONE RIGHT I DO HAVE A QUESTION CURIOUS SO THIS BILL INCLUDES BOTH PROVISIONS FOR- MILITARY VOTERS BUT ALSO- BUT PROVISIONS ON- PAROLEES DISCHARGE CERTAIN SEEMINGLY ODD PAIRING HOW IS IT THAT BOTH OF THESE ELEMENTS ON THE SAME BILL SURE SURE THE REASON I CAME TO US BECAUSE- THEY WERE- THEY BOTH INVOLVE CHANGES TO THE VOTER REGISTRATION PROCESS AND REGIONAL WAS. CONCEIVED OR BOTH CONDITION AROUND THE CONDITIONAL VOTER ON THAT PIECE AND- AS WE PROCEEDED ALONG- THEY WERE BOTH STILL INVOLVE CHANGES TO THE VOTER REGISTRATION PROCESS NOT EXACTLY BOTH CONDITIONAL VOTER PIECE BUT WE DECIDED TO KEEP THEM TOGETHER. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU AGAIN IT APPEARS THAT YOU HAVE IN SUPPORT MANY THE SAME FOLKS WHO OPPOSE LAST BILL SO I COMMEND. YOU ON YOUR BI PARTISANSHIP. THANK YOU FOR. HI DO YOU HAVE ANY OTHER. THIS HURTS. SENATOR NEWMAN IF THAT'S THE CASE SHOULD WE OPPOSE THIS BILL IT'S YOU'LL LINCOLN'S STORY YOU KNOW THE WHOLE STORY. IT WAS SHOULD WE OPPOSE THIS BILL HAS THAT YOU GET THE SAME PEOPLE ON THE FLIP SIDE OF THE DEAL I DON'T THINK IT'S SOME TO BE COMMENDED FOR I THINK IT'S WHICH PROBABLY OPPOSE THIS MEASURE. DON'T YOU THINK SO. AND SENATOR OUT LEYVA THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR QUICK QUESTION OF THE AUTHOR DID I READ THAT THE- CDCR HOUSE REPORT EACH WEEK ABOUT THE GIVE US AN UPDATE IS THAT CORRECT I JUST WANT TO SAID IF THAT'S TRUE I THINK THAT'S GREAT BECAUSE I THINK SOMETIMES WE WAIT TOO LONG BEFORE WE CHECK BACK IN AND FOLKS DON'T- DON'T NECESSARILY ACCESS THE RIGHTS YES THIS IS A SINGLE WEEKLY FLOW OF INFORMATION THAT'S GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH- CENTER- DECKER I THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BILL TO US I DON'T HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS.

SENATOR JOHN WE WELCOME YOU THIS IS SB ONE OF THREE UNIFORMED FAITHFUL PRESIDENTIAL ELECTORS ACT. I WONDER IF YOU REALLY NAMED IT THAT BUT WE'LL LOOK FORTY TESTIMONY. TODAY THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I WATER THERE IS NO PODIUM AND YOU'RE NOT ON TV THIS MORNING SO. THERE'S NO RESPECT FOR YOUR COMMITTEE EXCEPT FOR FROM. THIS BILL THE AUTHOR OF THIS BILL HAS. THE UTMOST RESPECT FOR THE COUNTRY. I'M ABOUT TO- PRESENT TO. SO WITH THAT MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS. ARE FIRST OF ALL I WILL I WILL BE TAKING THE AMENDMENTS SUGGESTED THE ANALYSIS INTAKE THE COMMITTEE STAFF- THEY'RE VERY VERY GOOD WORK ON THIS BILL. I WITH THE AMERICAN VOTERS CAST YOUR BALLOT FOR PRESIDENT THE UNITED STATES. THEY WERE ELECTING A SLATE OF ELECTORS. THESE ELECTORS THEN CAST BALLOTS. TO DECIDE WHO WILL BE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. IF THESE BALLOTS ARE CAST IN A WAY THAT REFLECTS THE WILL OF THE VOTERS. THERE ARE DOT. DEMOCRACY CEASES TO FUNCTION. THE SO CALLED PEOPLE SELECT- HOLDS THE POTENTIAL FOR GREAT POLITICAL CHAOS. SB ONE OH THREE PROVIDES FOR A STATE ADMINISTERED. PLEDGE OF FAITHFULNESS FROM ELECTORS. ANY ATTEMPT BY ELECTRIC TO SUBMIT A VOTE IN VIOLATION OF THAT PLEDGE WELL THEN EFFECTIVELY CONSTITUTE RESIGNATION FROM THE OFFICE OF ELECTOR WITH THIS BILL CALIFORNIA WILL JOIN THIRTY OTHER STATES THAT HAVE TAKEN THE ACTION TO DISCOURAGE OR FORBID FAITHLESS ELECTORAL VOTES. HERE TESTIFIED SUPPORT IS COMMISSIONER MARTY CAR LEGISLATIVE LIAISON FOR CALIFORNIA COMMISSION ON UNIFORM STATE LAWS. THANK YOU CENTER DIED AND WE WELCOME THE MISTER CAR. TO OUR COMMITTEE HEARING OPERATOR IF YOU WOULD OPEN UP THE LINE FOR MARTY CARLOS WE GET HERE STASHED MONEY. GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN GLAZER GOOD MORNING SENATORS CAN HEAR ME WE CAN'T HEAR YOU THANK YOU PLEASE PROCEED. THANK THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR GIVING ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU TODAY ABOUT SENATOR DODD SB ONE OF THREE CALIFORNIA'S VERSION OF THE UNIFORM FAITHFUL PRESIDENTIAL ELECTORS ACT I'VE BEEN A MEMBER OF THE CALIFORNIA COMMISSION ON UNIFORM STATE LAWS FOR OVER A DECADE IN THAT TIME I'VE SERVED AS CHAIR AND VICE CHAIR OF THE C. C. U. S. L. AND I'M CURRENTLY CALIFORNIA'S LEGISLATIVE LIAISON TO THE NATIONAL UNIFORM LAW COMMSSION. I WILL NOTE THAT THE CUMBERSOME NAME OF THIS ACT IS THE U. L. C.'S FAULT IT IS NOT SENATOR GODSWILL. FOR ALMOST A HUNDRED THIRTY YEARS THE YOU'LL SEE HAS PROVIDED STATES WITH NONPARTISAN WELL CONCEIVED AND WELL DRAFTED LEGISLATION. THAT BRINGS CLARITY AND STABILITY TO CRITICAL AREAS OF STATE STATUTORY LAW. SOME EXAMPLES ENACTED IN CALIFORNIA- THE UNIFORM COMMERCIAL CODE UNIFORM VOIDABLE TRANSACTIONS ACT. AND SENATOR DODD'S UNIFORM RECOGNITION AND ENFORCEMENT OF CANADIAN DOMESTIC VIOLENCE PROTECTION ORDERS ACT. FROM TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN. SB ONE OH THREE UNIFORMED PEOPLE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTORS ACT ADDRESSED THE POTENTIAL PROBLEM THAT HAS LONG BEEN RECOGNIZED IN CALIFORNIA LAW. IT PROVIDES A FAR BETTER SOLUTION THAN OUR EXISTING STATUTE. FOR MANY YEARS CALIFORNIA LAW IS HELD THAT A PRESIDENTIAL ELECTOR VOTES CONTRARY TO HIS OR HR COMMITMENT CAN BE FINED OR EVEN IMPRISONED. THIS IS ALL WELL AND GOOD BUT OUR EXISTING LAW DOES NOTHING TO INVALIDATE THE FACELESS VOTE. SO I UNDER EXISTING LAW THE VOTE THAT THE FAITHLESS ELECTORS WILL STAND IN THE WILL OF THE VOTERS WE FRUSTRATED. THE INFORMATICA EMBODIED IN SB ONE OF THREE CREATES A MECHANISM THAT PRETENSE OF FACELESS VOTE FROM COUNTING REPLACES THE FAITHLESS ELECTOR. THIS THIS IS SIMPLE COMMON SENSE AND IN TWENTY TWENTY. THE SUPREME COURT CASE OF COLORADO B. BALK AT UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT FOUND THAT SUCH A MECHANISM IS CONSTITUTIONAL. SIX STATES HAVE ALREADY ADOPTED THE UNIFORM ACT AND FOURTEEN OTHERS HAD THEIR OWN VERY SIMILAR RULES. FEW THINGS ARE MORE IMPORTANT THAN A VOTE OF THE PEOPLE IN A PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION SO I URGE YOU TO PASS THE STREET PORT IMPROVEMENTS FOR EXISTING CALIFORNIA LAW TO THIS COMMITTEE. ANYONE HAS A QUESTION I'LL BE HAPPY TO DO MY BEST TO ANSWER IT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CAR.

WE'RE GOING TO GO TO YOUR LEAD WITNESSES- MS- I DON'T A AND M'S MARTINEZ WE UP INVITE THEIR INVITE THEIR TESTIMONY INDICATE ASK THEM TO TRY TO LIMIT IT TO TWO MINUTES EACH AN OPERATOR WOULD YOU INVITE TO THIS NATALIE A DONUT TO BEGIN HER TESTIMONY. YOUR LINE IS OPEN. THANK YOU EVERYONE CAN YOU HEAR ME WE CAN HEAR YOU FINE. GREAT THANK YOU SENATOR- BURKE AND DISTINGUISHED COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR INVITING ME TO SPEAK THIS MORNING MY NAME IS NATALIE A DONNA AND I REPRESENT NEVADA COUNTY ELECTIONS WHICH SUPPORT SB THIRTY FIVE. NEVADA COUNTY IS ONE OF FIFTEEN COUNTY THAT ADMINISTERS ELECTIONS UNDER THE VOTERS CHOICE ACT UNDER THE BCA WE OFFER SEVERAL OPTIONS FOR RETURNING A VOTED BALLOT INCLUDING AN OFFICIAL DROPBOX. IN ABOUT A COUNTY APPROXIMATELY NOVEMBER TWENTY TWENTY ELECTION WILL RETURN TO BE A DROP BOX. SB THIRTY FIVE PROVIDES MUCH NEEDED CLARITY AND AFORDS DROP BOXES ROBUST PROTECTIONS AGAINST ELECTIONEERING IT ALSO MAKES CLEAR THAT ELECTIONS OFFICIALS ESTABLISHED IN CLARKSON'S AND NO ONE ELSE. DURING THE VOTING PERIOD LAST YEAR I WITNESSED A SATURDAY POLITICAL RALLY OF AROUND THREE HUNDRED TRUMP SUPPORTERS GATHERED IN THE COUNTY PARKING LOT. PARTICIPANTS BLOCK ACCESS TO THE DROP BOX IN OUR PARKING LOT WHICH HAS ENTRANCES OUTSIDE OF THE CURRENT ONE HUNDRED FOOT ELECTIONEERING BUFFER ZONES. ALL PARTICIPANTS HAVE SOME FORM OF PROHIBITED ELECTION HEARING SUCH AS LARGE FLAG WITH THE CANDIDATE'S NAME AND LIKENESS DECORATING NEARLY EVERY CAR. I HADN'T TEACHER TENDER AND AMPLIFIED POLITICAL SPEECH THAT I COULD HEAR FROM THE SECOND FLOOR OF MY OFFICE. UPSET VOTERS CALLED US SAYING THAT THEY COULDN'T ACCESS THE DROP BOX OR SELF INTIMIDATED APPROACHING THE DROP BOX WHILE THE RALLY WAS TAKING PLACE. ALL BOATERS OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO DROP OFF THEIR VOTE BY MAIL BALLOT IN A CALM NONPARTISAN ENVIRONMENT. VOTER SHOULD NEVER FEEL INTIMIDATED WHEN CATCHING THE BALLOT A BALLOT AND SHOULD NOT BE FORCED TO FIND ANOTHER LOCATION TO VOTE. SB THIRTY FIVE WILL HELP BY EXTENDING THE NO ELECTION HEARING DOCTORS DON'T FROM ONE HUNDRED TO TWO HUNDRED FEET. PROVIDING STRONGER VOTER ACCESS AND PROTECTION TO ALL OF OUR TOP OPTION. SB THIRTY FIVE HELPS PROTECT MY OFFICE PROTECT ALL OF OUR VOTERS FROM INTIMIDATION. I ENCOURAGE YOU ALL TO CONSIDER VOTING IN FAVOR OF SB THIRTY FIVE THANK YOU.

WE DISCUSS WITH THEM SENATOR- BURKE SOME CONFUSION THAT OCCURRED AT THE HONDA CENTER WHICH SERVED AS A VOTE TENER SUPERSITE IN ORANGE COUNTY. THE ISSUE OF AFFECTION BACKER NEEDED CLARITY THERE IS A LOCAL CANDIDATE THAT WAS UNCLEAR ABOUT ELECTION NEARING AND INTERPRETED THE LAW AS MEANING OVER ONE HUNDRED FEET FROM THE ENTIRE VENUE NOT FROM THE ENTRANCE TO THE BUILDING ROOM. AND ADDITION TO ROUTE ORANGE COUNTY BEING COUNTERED ISSUES AROUND UNAUTHORIZED BALLOT DROP BOXES POSING AS OFFICIAL AND EVEN A CAMPAIGN OFFICE THAT CLAIM TO BE AN OFFICIAL POLLING PLACE. I FROM BOTH GENDERS WE ALSO WITNESSED ISSUES WITH LONG LINES IT IS SOCIAL DISTANCING PROTOCOLS WHERE VOTERS WERE SUBJECT TO ELECTION HEARING JUST BECAUSE THEY WERE IN LINES THAT EXTENDED BEYOND THE HUNDRED FOOT BUFFER.
