STRAIGHTFORWARD FIRST AND

00:21:52.077 --> 00:21:55.681 region:rollup2
FOREMOST.

00:21:54.213 --> 00:21:56.215 region:rollup2
YOU FIGHT FOR THOSE DEVASTATE IN

00:21:55.681 --> 00:21:58.717 region:rollup2
THE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN

00:21:56.215 --> 00:21:59.718 region:rollup2
FIRES.

00:21:58.717 --> 00:22:00.886 region:rollup2
TO PREVENT FUTURE WILDFIRES FROM

00:21:59.718 --> 00:22:02.421 region:rollup2
CLAIMING [inaudible]

00:22:00.886 --> 00:22:05.457 region:rollup2
NEW VICTIMS [inaudible]

00:22:02.421 --> 00:22:07.593 region:rollup2
SECOND PREVENTING RATEPAYERS AND

00:22:05.457 --> 00:22:10.696 region:rollup2
TAXPAYERS FROM BEARING UNDUE

00:22:07.593 --> 00:22:11.931 region:rollup2
COST.

00:22:10.696 --> 00:22:13.499 region:rollup2
WE'VE SEEN UNPRECEDENTED

00:22:11.931 --> 00:22:16.135 region:rollup2
WILDFIRES ACROSS THE ENTIRE

00:22:13.499 --> 00:22:18.804 region:rollup2
STATE IN RECENT YEARS.

00:22:16.135 --> 00:22:20.406 region:rollup2
MY COMMUNITY WAS DEEPLY IMPACTED

00:22:18.804 --> 00:22:22.374 region:rollup2
BY THESE WILDFIRES LAST YEAR AND

00:22:20.406 --> 00:22:23.842 region:rollup2
I'VE ALREADY HAD NINETY THOUSAND

00:22:22.374 --> 00:22:25.177 region:rollup2
ACRES.

00:22:23.842 --> 00:22:26.912 region:rollup2
BURN IN MY DISTRICT ALONE THIS

00:22:25.177 --> 00:22:29.548 region:rollup2
YEAR.

00:22:26.912 --> 00:22:31.617 region:rollup2
WE CAN'T GO BACK IN TIME AND

00:22:29.548 --> 00:22:32.918 region:rollup2
CHANGE THE PAST TRAGEDIES.

00:22:31.617 --> 00:22:35.254 region:rollup2
BUT WE CANNOT FORGET ABOUT THE

00:22:32.918 --> 00:22:36.589 region:rollup2
VICTIMS.

00:22:35.254 --> 00:22:37.456 region:rollup2
AS A STATE WE MUST SUPPORT THEM

00:22:36.589 --> 00:22:38.824 region:rollup2
WEREN'T FROM THE STAKES IN THE

00:22:37.456 --> 00:22:40.893 region:rollup2
PAST.

00:22:38.824 --> 00:22:42.561 region:rollup2
IT ENSURED THAT WE WORK TO

00:22:40.893 --> 00:22:44.730 region:rollup2
PREVENT FUTURE WILDFIRES.

00:22:42.561 --> 00:22:47.199 region:rollup2
IN IMPLEMENTED BEST PRACTICES

00:22:44.730 --> 00:22:48.534 region:rollup2
GOING FORWARD.

00:22:47.199 --> 00:22:50.803 region:rollup2
IN ELKS OF PREVENTION IS WORTH A

00:22:48.534 --> 00:22:52.204 region:rollup2
POUND OF CURE.

00:22:50.803 --> 00:22:54.039 region:rollup2
WE NO DOWN POWER LINES OF

00:22:52.204 --> 00:22:56.408 region:rollup2
BECAUSE MANY OF THE DEVASTATING

00:22:54.039 --> 00:22:57.109 region:rollup2
FIRES IN THE PAST.

00:22:56.408 --> 00:23:00.246 region:rollup2
HELLFIRE IS COMPLETED

00:22:57.109 --> 00:23:02.481 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATIONS IT JUST SIXTEEN

00:23:00.246 --> 00:23:03.716 region:rollup2
OF LAST YEAR'S FIRES IN ITS FOR

00:23:02.481 --> 00:23:05.718 region:rollup2
ELEVEN CASES.

00:23:03.716 --> 00:23:07.353 region:rollup2
THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S BECAUSE

00:23:05.718 --> 00:23:10.155 region:rollup2
THEY FOUND EVIDENCE OF CRIMINAL

00:23:07.353 --> 00:23:13.259 region:rollup2
VIOLATIONS MAINLY DEALING WITH

00:23:10.155 --> 00:23:15.694 region:rollup2
TREE CLEARANCES.

00:23:13.259 --> 00:23:18.030 region:rollup2
FRANKLY PGM A VIOLATED OUR TRUST

00:23:15.694 --> 00:23:19.265 region:rollup2
INVEST BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE.

00:23:18.030 --> 00:23:21.100 region:rollup2
CLEARLY THE UTILITIES IN THE

00:23:19.265 --> 00:23:22.468 region:rollup2
CPUC NEED TO BE FORCED TO STEP

00:23:21.100 --> 00:23:24.169 region:rollup2
UP.

00:23:22.468 --> 00:23:25.905 region:rollup2
IT SURE THEY'RE MEETING OUR

00:23:24.169 --> 00:23:28.407 region:rollup2
SAFETY NEEDS.

00:23:25.905 --> 00:23:30.943 region:rollup2
BEFORE DISASTER STRIKES.

00:23:28.407 --> 00:23:31.777 region:rollup2
IT'S ALSO ABSOLUTELY INEXCUSABLE

00:23:30.943 --> 00:23:33.612 region:rollup2
AND IT CAN'T BE ALLOWED TO

00:23:31.777 --> 00:23:36.415 region:rollup2
HAPPEN AGAIN.

00:23:33.612 --> 00:23:38.050 region:rollup2
IF THE LEGISLATURE FAILS TO ACT.

00:23:36.415 --> 00:23:41.053 region:rollup2
AVOIDABLE FIRES WILL CONTINUE TO

00:23:38.050 --> 00:23:41.820 region:rollup2
HAPPEN.

00:23:41.053 --> 00:23:43.689 region:rollup2
THIS IS NOT ABOUT SPECIAL

00:23:41.820 --> 00:23:44.290 region:rollup2
INTEREST.

00:23:43.689 --> 00:23:46.125 region:rollup2
THEY'RE NOT OUR CONCERN RIGHT

00:23:44.290 --> 00:23:48.127 region:rollup2
NOW.

00:23:46.125 --> 00:23:49.828 region:rollup2
AGAIN THIS IS ABOUT COMMUNITIES.

00:23:48.127 --> 00:23:50.129 region:rollup2
VICTIMS AND RATEPAYERS

00:23:49.828 --> 00:23:53.399 region:rollup2
[inaudible]

00:23:50.129 --> 00:23:54.934 region:rollup2
PAST PRESENT AND FUTURE.

00:23:53.399 --> 00:23:58.637 region:rollup2
AND ULTIMATELY.

00:23:54.934 --> 00:23:59.905 region:rollup2
WHAT'S BEST FOR THEM.

00:23:58.637 --> 00:24:01.307 region:rollup2
I BEEN ON A MISSION OF WILDFIRE

00:23:59.905 --> 00:24:04.243 region:rollup2
RECOVERY PREVENTION AND

00:24:01.307 --> 00:24:06.612 region:rollup2
MITIGATION ALL YOUR LONG.

00:24:04.243 --> 00:24:07.913 region:rollup2
THE LAST FIRE SEASON UNDERSCORED

00:24:06.612 --> 00:24:09.948 region:rollup2
THE NEED TO THINK INNOVATIVELY

00:24:07.913 --> 00:24:11.717 region:rollup2
AND PRO ACTIVELY.

00:24:09.948 --> 00:24:13.585 region:rollup2
WE CAN ALL AGREE THE BUSINESS AS

00:24:11.717 --> 00:24:16.121 region:rollup2
USUAL IN A WORD [inaudible]

00:24:13.585 --> 00:24:17.356 region:rollup2
IS UNACCEPTABLE.

00:24:16.121 --> 00:24:18.691 region:rollup2
IT WE ALL AGREE THAT WE SHOULD

00:24:17.356 --> 00:24:20.526 region:rollup2
DO A BETTER JOB OF MANAGING OUR

00:24:18.691 --> 00:24:21.794 region:rollup2
ELECTRICAL SYSTEM.

00:24:20.526 --> 00:24:24.697 region:rollup2
SO POWER LINES DON'T START HUGE

00:24:21.794 --> 00:24:26.265 region:rollup2
FIRES.

00:24:24.697 --> 00:24:27.1000 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD INCLUDE STRENGTHENING

00:24:26.265 --> 00:24:30.135 region:rollup2
FIRE PREVENTION ACTIVITIES SUCH

00:24:27.1000 --> 00:24:31.670 region:rollup2
AS VEGETATION REMOVAL.

00:24:30.135 --> 00:24:33.505 region:rollup2
IF FOR STRUCTURE MAINTENANCE

00:24:31.670 --> 00:24:36.108 region:rollup2
UTILITY COMPANY INSPECTIONS

00:24:33.505 --> 00:24:36.742 region:rollup2
INTEMPERATE SHUT OFF OF POWER.

00:24:36.108 --> 00:24:39.712 region:rollup2
DURING EXTREME WEATHER

00:24:36.742 --> 00:24:40.879 region:rollup2
CONDITIONS.

00:24:39.712 --> 00:24:42.314 region:rollup2
MORE EXPANSIVE A DETAILED

00:24:40.879 --> 00:24:44.450 region:rollup2
WILDFIRE EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS

00:24:42.314 --> 00:24:45.718 region:rollup2
PLANTS.

00:24:44.450 --> 00:24:46.852 region:rollup2
AND THAT MEANS BETTER UTILITY

00:24:45.718 --> 00:24:48.654 region:rollup2
PLANNING A GREATER

00:24:46.852 --> 00:24:50.589 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THOSE WHO

00:24:48.654 --> 00:24:52.858 region:rollup2
OPERATE THE GRID.

00:24:50.589 --> 00:24:55.127 region:rollup2
INCLUDING CHECKING COMPLIANCE.

00:24:52.858 --> 00:24:56.829 region:rollup2
BEFORE A FIRE.

00:24:55.127 --> 00:24:58.063 region:rollup2
THAT'S AN AREA WHERE THE CPUC

00:24:56.829 --> 00:25:00.132 region:rollup2
HAS DONE QUITE POORLY REGULATED

00:24:58.063 --> 00:25:02.001 region:rollup2
UTILITIES IN ENSURING PUBLIC

00:25:00.132 --> 00:25:04.036 region:rollup2
SAFETY.

00:25:02.001 --> 00:25:05.304 region:rollup2
BUT WE ALL KNOW.

00:25:04.036 --> 00:25:06.872 region:rollup2
THERE'S NO SILVER BULLET FOR

00:25:05.304 --> 00:25:09.174 region:rollup2
PREVENTING.

00:25:06.872 --> 00:25:10.576 region:rollup2
SUCH DEVASTATING WILDFIRES WE

00:25:09.174 --> 00:25:10.876 region:rollup2
NEED TO TAKE A THOUGHTFUL

00:25:10.576 --> 00:25:12.911 region:rollup2
[inaudible]

00:25:10.876 --> 00:25:14.613 region:rollup2
HOLISTIC APPROACH.

00:25:12.911 --> 00:25:15.647 region:rollup2
THIS IS GOING TO BE AN OPEN

00:25:14.613 --> 00:25:17.816 region:rollup2
TRANSPARENT AND DELIBERATIVE

00:25:15.647 --> 00:25:18.717 region:rollup2
PROCESS.

00:25:17.816 --> 00:25:20.119 region:rollup2
TODAY WE ARE STARTING WITH AN

00:25:18.717 --> 00:25:21.720 region:rollup2
OVERVIEW.

00:25:20.119 --> 00:25:24.189 region:rollup2
AND WILL EXPLORE MORE ISSUES IN

00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:25.290 region:rollup2
DEPTH AND SUBSEQUENT HEARINGS.

00:25:24.189 --> 00:25:27.359 region:rollup2
AS A COMMITTEE WE WILL BE

00:25:25.290 --> 00:25:29.728 region:rollup2
TARGETED OUR SCOPE.

00:25:27.359 --> 00:25:31.363 region:rollup2
BUT LET ME MAKE THIS STATEMENT.

00:25:29.728 --> 00:25:33.532 region:rollup2
THIS IS NOT A CHRISTMAS TREE TO

00:25:31.363 --> 00:25:35.200 region:rollup2
ADD ON RELATED ISSUES.

00:25:33.532 --> 00:25:36.802 region:rollup2
WORKING TOGETHER BUILDING UPON

00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:38.804 region:rollup2
OUR WORK OVER THE LAST YEAR I

00:25:36.802 --> 00:25:40.239 region:rollup2
TRULY BELIEVE WE CAN MAKE REAL

00:25:38.804 --> 00:25:41.206 region:rollup2
PROGRESS THAT WILL MAKE OUR

00:25:40.239 --> 00:25:43.242 region:rollup2
STATE.

00:25:41.206 --> 00:25:44.843 region:rollup2
A SAFER PLACE.

00:25:43.242 --> 00:25:46.445 region:rollup2
WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME

00:25:44.843 --> 00:25:49.181 region:rollup2
AND FOR BEING HERE TODAY I WANT

00:25:46.445 --> 00:25:49.415 region:rollup2
TO TURN IT OVER TO THE CO CHAIR

00:25:49.181 --> 00:25:51.350 region:rollup2
OF THIS.

00:25:49.415 --> 00:25:53.352 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE CHRIS HOLDEN ASSEMBLY

00:25:51.350 --> 00:25:54.620 region:rollup2
MEMBER CHRIS HOLDEN.

00:25:53.352 --> 00:25:58.557 region:rollup2
THANK YOU SENATOR DODD AND I

JOIN WITH YOU AND YOUR ASSOCIATE

00:25:58.557 --> 00:26:01.794 region:rollup2
WITH YOUR COMMENTS.

00:26:00.459 --> 00:26:03.929 region:rollup2
OF OUR PURPOSE HERE IN THESE

00:26:01.794 --> 00:26:05.097 region:rollup2
CLOSING WEEKS.

00:26:03.929 --> 00:26:06.799 region:rollup2
SESSION IS TO BRING TO FRUITION

00:26:05.097 --> 00:26:08.667 region:rollup2
MONTHS.

00:26:06.799 --> 00:26:11.170 region:rollup2
OF RESEARCH AND DISCUSSION AND

00:26:08.667 --> 00:26:12.771 region:rollup2
HEARINGS CONCERNING WILDFIRES.

00:26:11.170 --> 00:26:14.540 region:rollup2
WILDFIRE PREVENTION AND YOU LOOK

00:26:12.771 --> 00:26:15.808 region:rollup2
UTILITY IMPACTS.

00:26:14.540 --> 00:26:17.242 region:rollup2
AS WE HAVE SEEN THE GROWING

00:26:15.808 --> 00:26:19.244 region:rollup2
CHANGE IN OUR WEATHER PATTERNS

00:26:17.242 --> 00:26:21.113 region:rollup2
AND A RESULTING RESULTING

00:26:19.244 --> 00:26:22.748 region:rollup2
GROWING THREAT OF CATASTROPHIC

00:26:21.113 --> 00:26:24.316 region:rollup2
FIRES IN OUR STATE.

00:26:22.748 --> 00:26:27.719 region:rollup2
WE MUST CHANGE HOW WE THINK

00:26:24.316 --> 00:26:29.088 region:rollup2
ABOUT AND MANAGE THAT THREAT.

00:26:27.719 --> 00:26:32.458 region:rollup2
THAT STARTS WITH ENSURING A SAFE

00:26:29.088 --> 00:26:33.625 region:rollup2
AND RELIABLE ELECTRIC GRID.

00:26:32.458 --> 00:26:35.928 region:rollup2
WE MUST PREVENT THE FIRES THAT

00:26:33.625 --> 00:26:37.729 region:rollup2
FROM OCCURRING. TO THE DEGREE

00:26:35.928 --> 00:26:39.965 region:rollup2
POSSIBLE AND THAT THE ELECTRIC

00:26:37.729 --> 00:26:41.433 region:rollup2
UTILITIES HAVE A CLEAR AND HIGH

00:26:39.965 --> 00:26:44.336 region:rollup2
STANDARD OF CARE TO ENSURE

00:26:41.433 --> 00:26:46.104 region:rollup2
PREVENTION AND SAFETY.

00:26:44.336 --> 00:26:47.106 region:rollup2
WHEN THESE TRAGEDIES DO OCCUR?

00:26:46.104 --> 00:26:49.041 region:rollup2
UTILITIES MUST BE HELD

00:26:47.106 --> 00:26:51.210 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBLE IF THEY DO NOT MEET

00:26:49.041 --> 00:26:52.010 region:rollup2
THAT STANDARD.

00:26:51.210 --> 00:26:54.246 region:rollup2
BUT WE ALSO NEED OUR ELECTRIC

00:26:52.010 --> 00:26:55.113 region:rollup2
UTILITIES.

00:26:54.246 --> 00:26:58.484 region:rollup2
THERE ARE THE BACKBONE OF OUR

00:26:55.113 --> 00:26:59.618 region:rollup2
DAILY EXISTENCE AND OUR ECONOMY.

00:26:58.484 --> 00:27:01.286 region:rollup2
THEREFORE WE MUST CONSIDER WAYS

00:26:59.618 --> 00:27:03.222 region:rollup2
THAT THE UTILITIES CAN MANAGE

00:27:01.286 --> 00:27:04.423 region:rollup2
THE COSTS WITHOUT DISRUPTING

00:27:03.222 --> 00:27:06.525 region:rollup2
SERVICE TO CUSTOMERS.

THAT WE MUST FACE.

I'D LIKE TO START WITH CONVEYING

00:27:52.938 --> 00:27:56.542 region:rollup2

THE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN

00:27:58.076 --> 00:28:01.947 region:rollup2
WILDFIRES.

00:28:00.546 --> 00:28:02.814 region:rollup2
IN THE DISCUSSION OF THE POLICY

00:28:01.947 --> 00:28:05.617 region:rollup2
AND IN THE BATTLE OVER THE

00:28:02.814 --> 00:28:07.553 region:rollup2
POLITICS I DON'T WANT US TO LOSE

00:28:05.617 --> 00:28:09.254 region:rollup2
SIGHT OF THE DEVASTATING.

00:28:07.553 --> 00:28:10.389 region:rollup2
OF THE DEVASTATION FACED BY

00:28:09.254 --> 00:28:12.424 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES IN THIS STATE

00:28:10.389 --> 00:28:13.992 region:rollup2
WILDFIRES.

00:28:12.424 --> 00:28:16.495 region:rollup2
DEVASTATION THAT IS DISPLACED

00:28:13.992 --> 00:28:19.231 region:rollup2
THE LIVES OF ENTIRE COMMUNITIES.

00:28:16.495 --> 00:28:22.734 region:rollup2
ERASED DREAMS AND MEMORIES AND

00:28:19.231 --> 00:28:24.303 region:rollup2
THAT IS ULTIMATELY COST LIVES.

00:28:22.734 --> 00:28:25.604 region:rollup2
FOR THOSE WHO HAVE SUFFERED WE

00:28:24.303 --> 00:28:28.106 region:rollup2
OWE IT TO THEM TO ENSURE THAT

00:28:25.604 --> 00:28:29.174 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA IS READY TO DEAL WITH

00:28:28.106 --> 00:28:31.476 region:rollup2
THE GROWING.

00:28:29.174 --> 00:28:33.312 region:rollup2
FIRE DEBT DANGER.

00:28:31.476 --> 00:28:35.047 region:rollup2
I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO EXTEND THE

00:28:33.312 --> 00:28:37.349 region:rollup2
GRATITUDE OF THIS COMMITTEE TO

00:28:35.047 --> 00:28:38.984 region:rollup2
THE FIRST RESPONDERS.

00:28:37.349 --> 00:28:40.352 region:rollup2
FIRST RESPONDERS WHO OF BATTLED

00:28:38.984 --> 00:28:42.287 region:rollup2
OF THESE FIRES ARE CURRENTLY

00:28:40.352 --> 00:28:44.122 region:rollup2
SUPPRESSING FIRES UP AND DOWN

00:28:42.287 --> 00:28:45.657 region:rollup2
THE STATE.

00:28:44.122 --> 00:28:48.026 region:rollup2
WORKING THE FIRE LINES MAYBE

00:28:45.657 --> 00:28:49.461 region:rollup2
YOUR PROFESSION.

00:28:48.026 --> 00:28:51.029 region:rollup2
BUT WE ARE AND ALL OF YOUR

00:28:49.461 --> 00:28:52.731 region:rollup2
BRAVERY AND SACRIFICE AND THAT

00:28:51.029 --> 00:28:54.833 region:rollup2
OF YOUR FAMILY'S WHILE YOU ARE

00:28:52.731 --> 00:28:56.335 region:rollup2
IN HARM'S WAY.

00:28:54.833 --> 00:28:57.869 region:rollup2
WE KNOW THAT THE DESTRUCTIVENESS

00:28:56.335 --> 00:28:59.905 region:rollup2
OF WILDFIRES IN CALIFORNIA IS

00:28:57.869 --> 00:29:02.074 region:rollup2
INCREASING DUE TO A VARIETY OF

00:28:59.905 --> 00:29:04.142 region:rollup2
FACTORS.

00:29:02.074 --> 00:29:06.011 region:rollup2
INCLUDING MULTI YEAR DROUGHT THE

00:29:04.142 --> 00:29:08.480 region:rollup2
AFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE.

00:29:06.011 --> 00:29:09.848 region:rollup2
IT IS CLEAR THAT.

00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:11.984 region:rollup2
IT IS A CLEAR THREAT THAT WE

00:29:09.848 --> 00:29:13.819 region:rollup2
CANNOT IGNORE.

00:29:11.984 --> 00:29:15.454 region:rollup2
WE ALSO KNOW THAT THEIR ARE

00:29:13.819 --> 00:29:18.056 region:rollup2
MEASURES THAT CAN TAKE CAN AND

00:29:15.454 --> 00:29:20.659 region:rollup2
MUST BE TAKEN TO REDUCE THE RISK

00:29:18.056 --> 00:29:21.827 region:rollup2
OF WILDFIRES.

00:29:20.659 --> 00:29:23.595 region:rollup2
ADDITIONALLY THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN

00:29:21.827 --> 00:29:26.465 region:rollup2
FOUND RESPONSIBLE FOR THE WILD

00:29:23.595 --> 00:29:29.167 region:rollup2
FIRES WE'VE ALREADY SUFFERED.

00:29:26.465 --> 00:29:30.869 region:rollup2
MUST BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE.

00:29:29.167 --> 00:29:32.871 region:rollup2
SOME STUDIES HAVE FOUND THAT 50%

00:29:30.869 --> 00:29:35.741 region:rollup2
OF CALIFORNIA'S HOMES FACE.

00:29:32.871 --> 00:29:36.875 region:rollup2
SEVERE WILDFIRE RISKS.

00:29:35.741 --> 00:29:39.378 region:rollup2
NO ONE IS INSULATED FROM THIS

00:29:36.875 --> 00:29:40.612 region:rollup2
DANGER.

00:29:39.378 --> 00:29:42.314 region:rollup2
THE RESULTING DESTRUCTION COSTS

00:29:40.612 --> 00:29:44.082 region:rollup2
COST ALL OF US.

00:29:42.314 --> 00:29:47.285 region:rollup2
INCREASED RATES OF INSURANCE

00:29:44.082 --> 00:29:49.354 region:rollup2
PREMIUMS UTILITY CHARGES AND

00:29:47.285 --> 00:29:51.323 region:rollup2
COST AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT.

00:29:49.354 --> 00:29:53.058 region:rollup2
LAST YEAR THE COST TO CALIFORNIA

00:29:51.323 --> 00:29:55.060 region:rollup2
ALONE WAS OVER SEVEN HUNDRED

00:29:53.058 --> 00:29:56.595 region:rollup2
MILLION DOLLARS.

00:29:55.060 --> 00:29:58.397 region:rollup2
THE POINT IS THAT WE ALL PAY IN

00:29:56.595 --> 00:30:00.232 region:rollup2
SOME FORM.

00:29:58.397 --> 00:30:02.401 region:rollup2
THERE IS THIS IS NOT SOMEONE

00:30:00.232 --> 00:30:03.902 region:rollup2
ELSE'S PROBLEM.

00:30:02.401 --> 00:30:05.070 region:rollup2
WE MUST USE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO

00:30:03.902 --> 00:30:07.839 region:rollup2
GET A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF THE

00:30:05.070 --> 00:30:10.242 region:rollup2
DANGER THE RISKS AND OUR POLICY

00:30:07.839 --> 00:30:11.843 region:rollup2
OPTIONS.

00:30:10.242 --> 00:30:13.211 region:rollup2
THE NIGHT THE DANGER MAY BE

00:30:11.843 --> 00:30:15.347 region:rollup2
INCREASED BUT WE SHOULD NOT

00:30:13.211 --> 00:30:17.182 region:rollup2
ACCEPT THESE RESULTS AS THE NEW

00:30:15.347 --> 00:30:18.784 region:rollup2
NORMAL.

00:30:17.182 --> 00:30:20.585 region:rollup2
AS THE HOOVER INSTITUTION STATED

00:30:18.784 --> 00:30:21.753 region:rollup2
IN A POLICY BRIEF ON

00:30:20.585 --> 00:30:23.655 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA'S FIRE DANGER.

00:30:21.753 --> 00:30:25.390 region:rollup2
AND I QUOTE.

00:30:23.655 --> 00:30:27.592 region:rollup2
DEVASTATING FIRES ARE NOTHING

00:30:25.390 --> 00:30:29.161 region:rollup2
NEW IN CALIFORNIA STATE HISTORY

00:30:27.592 --> 00:30:31.830 region:rollup2
AND FROM EVERYTHING WE KNOW THEY

00:30:29.161 --> 00:30:33.732 region:rollup2
WILL REMAIN A CONSTANT FORCE.

00:30:31.830 --> 00:30:34.900 region:rollup2
HOWEVER A FUTURE FILLED WITH

00:30:33.732 --> 00:30:36.501 region:rollup2
MORE AND MORE DESTRUCTIVE

00:30:34.900 --> 00:30:38.704 region:rollup2
WILDFIRES.

00:30:36.501 --> 00:30:40.472 region:rollup2
EACH OUTDOING THE LAST IS NOT

00:30:38.704 --> 00:30:42.774 region:rollup2
INEVITABLE.

00:30:40.472 --> 00:30:43.975 region:rollup2
THE STATE CAN MAKE CHOICES NO

00:30:42.774 --> 00:30:46.011 region:rollup2
THERE WILL HELP KEEP IT SAFE FOR

00:30:43.975 --> 00:30:48.046 region:rollup2
IN THE FUTURE.

00:30:46.011 --> 00:30:50.482 region:rollup2
WE'VE BEEN TASKED WITH REVIEWING

00:30:48.046 --> 00:30:51.683 region:rollup2
EVIDENCE HEARING TESTIMONY AND

00:30:50.482 --> 00:30:53.318 region:rollup2
WEIGHING THE INTEREST OF ALL

00:30:51.683 --> 00:30:54.953 region:rollup2
STAKEHOLDERS TO PROVIDE

00:30:53.318 --> 00:30:55.754 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONS OF

00:30:54.953 --> 00:30:57.823 region:rollup2
PROPOSALS.

00:30:55.754 --> 00:31:00.192 region:rollup2
THERE WILL BE.

00:30:57.823 --> 00:31:01.927 region:rollup2
IN THE FINAL CONFERENCE REPORT.

00:31:00.192 --> 00:31:04.129 region:rollup2
TODAY'S HEARING IS ESPECIALLY

00:31:01.927 --> 00:31:05.931 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT TO LAY THE FOUNDATION

00:31:04.129 --> 00:31:07.866 region:rollup2
STATE THE FACTS AND FRAME THE

00:31:05.931 --> 00:31:09.000 region:rollup2
ISSUES.

00:31:07.866 --> 00:31:11.036 region:rollup2
I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:13.338 region:rollup2
MY COLLEAGUES ON AN ISSUE THAT

00:31:11.036 --> 00:31:14.606 region:rollup2
REQUIRES EXTRAORDINARY ATTENTION

00:31:13.338 --> 00:31:17.609 region:rollup2
AND A COMMITMENT TO DO WHAT'S

00:31:14.606 --> 00:31:18.810 region:rollup2
BEST FOR THOSE MOST AFFECTED.

00:31:17.609 --> 00:31:20.545 region:rollup2
AND TO TAKE MEASURES THAT WILL

00:31:18.810 --> 00:31:24.616 region:rollup2
ULTIMATELY REDUCE THE RISK AND

00:31:20.545 --> 00:31:27.953 region:rollup2
DANGER A FUTURE WILDFIRES.

00:31:24.616 --> 00:31:29.454 region:rollup2
SO THERE HUESO.

00:31:27.953 --> 00:31:30.088 region:rollup2
I JUST SIMPLY WANTED TO CONCUR

00:31:29.454 --> 00:31:31.389 region:rollup2
WITH THE COMMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN

00:31:30.088 --> 00:31:34.960 region:rollup2
MADE.

00:31:31.389 --> 00:31:36.194 region:rollup2
MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MISTER.

00:31:34.960 --> 00:31:42.134 region:rollup2

OF AND AND CONCUR WITH THE

00:31:42.134 --> 00:31:45.270 region:rollup2
COMMON SORT OF MADE BUT SIMPLY

00:31:43.368 --> 00:31:47.973 region:rollup2
TO STATE.

00:31:45.270 --> 00:31:48.840 region:rollup2
THAT OF I BELIEVE.

00:31:47.973 --> 00:31:50.142 region:rollup2
THAT.

00:31:48.840 --> 00:31:52.944 region:rollup2
THE TIME HAS COME FOR US TO

00:31:50.142 --> 00:31:54.679 region:rollup2
REALLY STEP UP AND MAKE.

00:31:52.944 --> 00:31:56.815 region:rollup2
SOME POLICY CHANGES SETTING

00:31:54.679 --> 00:31:58.417 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA TO ADDRESS.

00:31:56.815 --> 00:31:59.818 region:rollup2
THE CHANGES THAT ARE HAPPENING

00:31:58.417 --> 00:32:02.721 region:rollup2
OUR STATE IS UNDERGOING.

00:31:59.818 --> 00:32:04.923 region:rollup2
AN ENORMOUS CHANGE.

00:32:02.721 --> 00:32:06.925 region:rollup2
I MEAN IF IF PEOPLE.

00:32:04.923 --> 00:32:08.593 region:rollup2
NOW I BE NOT ONE THING I HAVEN'T

00:32:06.925 --> 00:32:09.161 region:rollup2
HEARD IS THAT THE CLIMATE CHANGE

00:32:08.593 --> 00:32:10.862 region:rollup2
DENIERS HAVE BEEN VERY QUIET

00:32:09.161 --> 00:32:12.798 region:rollup2
LATELY.

00:32:10.862 --> 00:32:13.899 region:rollup2
AND ONE THING IS VERY OBVIOUS --

00:32:12.798 --> 00:32:16.001 region:rollup2
EVEN EVEN THE ANIMALS ARE

00:32:13.899 --> 00:32:17.869 region:rollup2
MIGRATING NORTH.

00:32:16.001 --> 00:32:19.371 region:rollup2
SENDING US A MESSAGE SOMETHING

00:32:17.869 --> 00:32:22.374 region:rollup2
IS HAPPENING WITHOUT A CHANGE

00:32:19.371 --> 00:32:26.344 region:rollup2
OUR POLICY. TO ADDRESS THAT.

00:32:22.374 --> 00:32:28.346 region:rollup2
AND AND IT SADDENS ME TO SEE.

00:32:26.344 --> 00:32:29.981 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW AS WE SPEAK NOW.

00:32:28.346 --> 00:32:31.349 region:rollup2
FIRES APPROACH YOSEMITE.

00:32:29.981 --> 00:32:34.653 region:rollup2
THEIR FIRES BURNING CURRENTLY IN

00:32:31.349 --> 00:32:36.721 region:rollup2
OUR STATE CAUSING ENORMOUS HARM.

00:32:34.653 --> 00:32:38.924 region:rollup2
AND IN ITS ANNUAL COUNTY THERE

00:32:36.721 --> 00:32:40.192 region:rollup2
BEEN JUST DEVASTATING FIRES JUST

00:32:38.924 --> 00:32:41.626 region:rollup2
LIKE IN ANY OTHER COUNTY.

00:32:40.192 --> 00:32:42.594 region:rollup2
BUT IT'S AN EAGLE COUNTY WE HAVE

00:32:41.626 --> 00:32:43.929 region:rollup2
TAKEN.

00:32:42.594 --> 00:32:44.863 region:rollup2
ALREADY SOME --

00:32:43.929 --> 00:32:46.431 region:rollup2
ENORMOUS MEASURES --

00:32:44.863 --> 00:32:48.233 region:rollup2
TO PREVENT.

00:32:46.431 --> 00:32:49.801 region:rollup2
AND UNLESS IN THOSE FIRES AND

00:32:48.233 --> 00:32:51.303 region:rollup2
I'M VERY PROUD OF THE WORK WE'VE

00:32:49.801 --> 00:32:52.604 region:rollup2
DONE IN SAN DIEGO.

00:32:51.303 --> 00:32:54.139 region:rollup2
AND ENSURE SERVES AS A MODEL OF

00:32:52.604 --> 00:32:55.807 region:rollup2
WHAT WE CAN DO IN THE STATE.

00:32:54.139 --> 00:32:57.943 region:rollup2
THEIR POLICIES AND SAN DIEGO

00:32:55.807 --> 00:32:59.444 region:rollup2
THAT APPLY ONLY TO SAN DIEGO.

00:32:57.943 --> 00:33:00.946 region:rollup2
AND THAT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

00:32:59.444 --> 00:33:03.114 region:rollup2
BECAUSE FIRES ARE AFFECTED EVERY

00:33:00.946 --> 00:33:04.649 region:rollup2
PART OF THE STATE NOW AND START

00:33:03.114 --> 00:33:05.617 region:rollup2
FIRST WE NEED TO START LOOKING

00:33:04.649 --> 00:33:07.486 region:rollup2
AT HOW.

00:33:05.617 --> 00:33:09.554 region:rollup2
THAT'S WORKING FOR US IN HOW CAN

00:33:07.486 --> 00:33:10.121 region:rollup2
HELP THE RISK STATES THANK YOU

00:33:09.554 --> 00:33:13.291 region:rollup2

WISE YOU NOW HAVE A WILDFIRE

00:39:57.195 --> 00:39:59.831 region:rollup2

00:39:58.363 --> 00:40:01.633 region:rollup2
MORE DEVASTATING.

00:39:59.831 --> 00:40:03.301 region:rollup2

IN MANY WAYS IT'S GOING TO BE.

00:41:17.041 --> 00:41:20.278 region:rollup2

WE CONFRONT AS A STATE AND YOU

00:47:12.163 --> 00:47:15.232 region:rollup2
CONFRONT AS A COMMITTEE IS THAT

00:47:13.864 --> 00:47:17.368 region:rollup2
THE CURRENT SYSTEM FOR

00:47:15.232 --> 00:47:18.436 region:rollup2
ALLOCATING IN MANAGING THE RISK

00:47:17.368 --> 00:47:20.271 region:rollup2
OF WILDFIRES IN CALIFORNIA.

00:47:18.436 --> 00:47:23.574 region:rollup2
IS UNSUSTAINABLE. FOR MULTIPLE

00:47:20.271 --> 00:47:25.576 region:rollup2
REASONS. ONE IS THAT.

00:47:23.574 --> 00:47:27.044 region:rollup2
THE SITUATION IS UNSAFE AS I

00:47:25.576 --> 00:47:29.513 region:rollup2
HEARD YOU ELOQUENTLY SPEAK ABOUT

00:47:27.044 --> 00:47:30.815 region:rollup2
THIS MORNING. TOO MANY PEOPLE

00:47:29.513 --> 00:47:33.484 region:rollup2
ARE BEING KILLED [inaudible]

00:47:30.815 --> 00:47:35.319 region:rollup2
AND HURT.

00:47:35.319 --> 00:47:38.389 region:rollup2
WILDFIRES IN THE STATE.

00:47:37.288 --> 00:47:39.890 region:rollup2
PART OF THE REASON FOR THAT ARE

00:47:38.389 --> 00:47:41.158 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT PART A RISK THAT IS

00:47:39.890 --> 00:47:41.592 region:rollup2
THAT ALL SIDES OF THE PROBLEM

00:47:41.158 --> 00:47:43.194 region:rollup2
ARE NOT BEING WORKED

00:47:41.592 --> 00:47:45.196 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVELY.

00:47:43.194 --> 00:47:45.996 region:rollup2
SUMMER BEING WORKED LESS THAN

00:47:45.196 --> 00:47:48.833 region:rollup2
THEY SHOULD.

00:47:45.996 --> 00:47:49.133 region:rollup2
SOME ARE NOT EVEN ADDRESSED

00:47:48.833 --> 00:47:50.568 region:rollup2
[inaudible]

00:47:49.133 --> 00:47:52.436 region:rollup2
IN ADDITION [inaudible]

00:47:50.568 --> 00:47:54.171 region:rollup2

ELECTRICITY CUSTOMER.

00:48:00.444 --> 00:48:03.981 region:rollup2
OR AS A TAXPAYER.

00:48:02.046 --> 00:48:07.318 region:rollup2
RATE PAYER IMPACTS IF IT TURNS

00:48:03.981 --> 00:48:09.620 region:rollup2
OUT THAT RATEPAYERS ARE

00:48:07.318 --> 00:48:10.454 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTABLE. FOR THE FIRE THAT

00:48:09.620 --> 00:48:11.222 region:rollup2
WE KNOW THE LEAST ABOUT TUBBS

00:48:10.454 --> 00:48:13.090 region:rollup2
FIRE [inaudible]

00:48:11.222 --> 00:48:14.125 region:rollup2
COULD BE.

00:48:13.090 --> 00:48:15.459 region:rollup2
ANYWHERE --

00:48:14.125 --> 00:48:18.362 region:rollup2
FROM TWENTY TO FORTY DOLLARS PER

00:48:15.459 --> 00:48:20.097 region:rollup2
MONTH. FOR EVERYONE IN THE P. G.

WE DON'T KNOW WITH THE OUTCOMES

00:48:20.731 --> 00:48:24.268 region:rollup2
IN THE THERE BUT THAT RISK IS

00:48:22.099 --> 00:48:26.103 region:rollup2
THERE FOR TUBS AND FOR A FUTURE

00:48:24.268 --> 00:48:26.971 region:rollup2
FIRED THAT MIGHT OCCUR IF P.

00:48:26.103 --> 00:48:28.339 region:rollup2
JEANNIE.

00:48:26.971 --> 00:48:30.174 region:rollup2
BEHAVES PRUDENTLY WHICH

00:48:28.339 --> 00:48:32.410 region:rollup2
HOPEFULLY THEY DO --

00:48:30.174 --> 00:48:34.078 region:rollup2
FINALLY.

00:48:32.410 --> 00:48:34.845 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF THE THREATS TO THE

00:48:34.078 --> 00:48:36.514 region:rollup2
FINANCES OF THE ELECTRIC

00:48:34.845 --> 00:48:38.382 region:rollup2
UTILITIES [inaudible]

WILDFIRE.

00:48:38.382 --> 00:48:40.751 region:rollup2
FUNDAMENTALLY THREATENS THE

00:48:39.717 --> 00:48:42.353 region:rollup2
CLIMATE AND CLEAN ENERGY GOALS

00:48:40.751 --> 00:48:44.321 region:rollup2
OF THE STATE.

00:48:42.353 --> 00:48:45.556 region:rollup2
UTILITY RISKS WILL WILL AND

00:48:44.321 --> 00:48:47.858 region:rollup2
ALREADY ARE INCREASING THE

00:48:45.556 --> 00:48:49.593 region:rollup2
EXPECTATION FOR RETURN ON EQUITY

00:48:47.858 --> 00:48:51.095 region:rollup2
OF THE FOLKS THAT OWN P. JEANNIE

00:48:49.593 --> 00:48:52.463 region:rollup2
SHARES.

00:48:51.095 --> 00:48:54.732 region:rollup2
THAT'S GONNA RAISE THE COST FOR

00:48:52.463 --> 00:48:55.699 region:rollup2
EVERYTHING THAT YOU AND MANY OF

00:48:54.732 --> 00:48:57.168 region:rollup2

00:48:57.168 --> 00:49:00.004 region:rollup2
THE NEXT DECADE.

00:48:58.869 --> 00:49:01.639 region:rollup2
POTENTIALLY TO LEVELS THAT RULE

00:49:00.004 --> 00:49:03.841 region:rollup2
OUT.

00:49:01.639 --> 00:49:05.242 region:rollup2
ACHIEVING THE CLIMATE TARGETS --

00:49:03.841 --> 00:49:05.743 region:rollup2
AND SO IT'S IMPORTANT TO BEAR IN

00:49:05.242 --> 00:49:07.011 region:rollup2
MIND THAT ALL OF THIS IS

00:49:05.743 --> 00:49:07.912 region:rollup2
CONNECTED.

00:49:07.011 --> 00:49:10.014 region:rollup2
AND IT MANAGING THIS RISK

00:49:07.912 --> 00:49:10.581 region:rollup2
AFFECTIVELY.

00:49:10.014 --> 00:49:13.350 region:rollup2
SHRINKING THE RISK IS GONNA

00:49:10.581 --> 00:49:16.754 region:rollup2
HELP.

00:49:13.350 --> 00:49:18.556 region:rollup2
MAKE OTHER GOALS ACHIEVABLE.

00:49:16.754 --> 00:49:19.824 region:rollup2
A SOLUTION TO WILDFIRE RISK IT'S

00:49:18.556 --> 00:49:22.126 region:rollup2
AN ADDRESS ALL THE DIMENSIONS OF

00:49:19.824 --> 00:49:23.561 region:rollup2
THE RISK WILDFIRE RISK IS NOT

00:49:22.126 --> 00:49:24.862 region:rollup2
JUST A UTILITY ISSUE I WOULD

00:49:23.561 --> 00:49:27.298 region:rollup2
ARGUE THAT IT IS NOT EVEN MOSTLY

00:49:24.862 --> 00:49:28.732 region:rollup2
A UTILITY ISSUE.

00:49:27.298 --> 00:49:30.734 region:rollup2
THERE ISSUES AROUND A POLICY

00:49:28.732 --> 00:49:31.268 region:rollup2
SOLUTIONS GONNA REQUIRE THINKING

00:49:30.734 --> 00:49:32.803 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN

00:49:31.268 --> 00:49:34.972 region:rollup2
LIABILITY.

00:49:32.803 --> 00:49:36.941 region:rollup2
THAT ALREADY IS EXIT EXISTING.

00:49:34.972 --> 00:49:38.642 region:rollup2
FOLKS NEED TO BE MADE WHOLE PUT

00:49:36.941 --> 00:49:40.711 region:rollup2
BACK IN THEIR HOUSES AS

00:49:38.642 --> 00:49:41.946 region:rollup2
EXPEDITIOUSLY AS POSSIBLE.

00:49:40.711 --> 00:49:44.114 region:rollup2
THEY'RE IMPORTANT ISSUES AROUND

00:49:41.946 --> 00:49:46.383 region:rollup2
INVERSE CONDEMNATION UTILITY

00:49:44.114 --> 00:49:48.319 region:rollup2
WILDFIRE PLANNING ACCOUNTABILITY

00:49:46.383 --> 00:49:49.920 region:rollup2
AND ULTIMATELY COST RECOVERY.

00:49:48.319 --> 00:49:51.088 region:rollup2
HOMEOWNERS PROPERTY CASUALTY

00:49:49.920 --> 00:49:52.790 region:rollup2
INSURANCE AND REINSURANCE

00:49:51.088 --> 00:49:54.124 region:rollup2
THERE'S A BREWING.

00:49:52.790 --> 00:49:55.659 region:rollup2
INSURANCE CRISIS IN THE STATE OF

00:49:54.124 --> 00:49:56.861 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA BECAUSE OF THIS RISK

00:49:55.659 --> 00:49:57.695 region:rollup2
AND THE LACK OF MANAGEMENT

00:49:56.861 --> 00:49:58.896 region:rollup2
THAT'S OCCURRING WE NEED TO LOOK

00:49:57.695 --> 00:50:01.599 region:rollup2
AT THAT.

00:49:58.896 --> 00:50:03.767 region:rollup2
A HARD PROBLEM.

00:50:01.599 --> 00:50:05.236 region:rollup2
VEGETATION MANAGEMENT WHERE

00:50:03.767 --> 00:50:06.871 region:rollup2
PEOPLE ACTUALLY LIVE CONTROLLED

00:50:05.236 --> 00:50:08.839 region:rollup2
BURNS ARE IMPORTANT.

00:50:06.871 --> 00:50:09.874 region:rollup2
BUT WHERE THE VALUE AT RISK AND

00:50:08.839 --> 00:50:12.209 region:rollup2
THE LIVES AT RISK ARE MOST

00:50:09.874 --> 00:50:13.644 region:rollup2
CONCENTRATED CONTROLLED BURNS

00:50:12.209 --> 00:50:15.212 region:rollup2
ARE VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO

00:50:13.644 --> 00:50:16.580 region:rollup2
ACCOMPLISH OTHER SOLUTIONS TO

00:50:15.212 --> 00:50:18.249 region:rollup2
TAKE ACCOUNT OF THE DIVERSITY OF

00:50:16.580 --> 00:50:20.050 region:rollup2
PROPERTY OWNERSHIP IN THE SMALL

00:50:18.249 --> 00:50:21.418 region:rollup2
PARCELS ARE GONNA BE REQUIRED.

00:50:20.050 --> 00:50:22.486 region:rollup2
LAND USE PLANNING AS WAS

00:50:21.418 --> 00:50:24.221 region:rollup2
MENTIONED IS GOING TO BE VERY

00:50:22.486 --> 00:50:26.290 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT AND BUILDING CODES

00:50:24.221 --> 00:50:27.825 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY FOR OLDER BUILDINGS.

00:50:26.290 --> 00:50:29.293 region:rollup2
CURRENT FIRE SAFE BUILDING CODES

00:50:27.825 --> 00:50:31.228 region:rollup2
APPLY ONLY TO BUILDINGS THAT ARE

00:50:29.293 --> 00:50:33.831 region:rollup2
NEW SINCE TWO THOUSAND EIGHT OR

00:50:31.228 --> 00:50:34.131 region:rollup2
SUBSTANTIALLY REBUILT SINCE

00:50:33.831 --> 00:50:35.599 region:rollup2
[inaudible]

00:50:34.131 --> 00:50:37.501 region:rollup2
TWO THOUSAND EIGHT SO.

00:50:35.599 --> 00:50:39.003 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVE RISK MANAGEMENT IT'S

00:50:37.501 --> 00:50:40.604 region:rollup2
GONNA APPORTION THE RISK TO

00:50:39.003 --> 00:50:41.539 region:rollup2
THOSE WHO CAN MANAGE IT MOST

00:50:40.604 --> 00:50:42.873 region:rollup2
EFFICIENTLY AND THAT MEANS

00:50:41.539 --> 00:50:45.075 region:rollup2
CARVING UP.

00:50:42.873 --> 00:50:46.911 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW AT LEAST FOR UTILITY

00:50:45.075 --> 00:50:48.679 region:rollup2
COSTS WILDFIRES.

00:50:46.911 --> 00:50:50.848 region:rollup2
MOST OF THE RISK RESTS WITH

00:50:48.679 --> 00:50:52.082 region:rollup2
UTILITY RATE PAYERS BY INVERSE

00:50:50.848 --> 00:50:53.951 region:rollup2
CONDEMNATION AND EXPENSES

00:50:52.082 --> 00:50:55.753 region:rollup2
ALLOWED IN RATES IF THE UTILITY

00:50:53.951 --> 00:50:57.922 region:rollup2
WAS PRUDENT.

00:50:55.753 --> 00:50:59.890 region:rollup2
OR WITH UTILITY SHAREHOLDERS BY

00:50:57.922 --> 00:51:01.525 region:rollup2
INVERSE CONDEMNATION OR THE AND

00:50:59.890 --> 00:51:03.527 region:rollup2
DISALLOWANCE IF THE UTILITY WAS

00:51:01.525 --> 00:51:06.063 region:rollup2
NOT PRUDENT [inaudible]

00:51:03.527 --> 00:51:07.932 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANTLY HOMEOWNERS AND

00:51:06.063 --> 00:51:09.333 region:rollup2
THEIR INSURANCE COMPANIES DON'T

00:51:07.932 --> 00:51:10.434 region:rollup2
BEAR A LOT OF THAT RISK BECAUSE

00:51:09.333 --> 00:51:12.403 region:rollup2
THEY CAN SUBJUGATE AGAINST THE

00:51:10.434 --> 00:51:14.305 region:rollup2
UTILITY.

00:51:12.403 --> 00:51:16.607 region:rollup2
WE SHOULD BE ASKING WHETHER THAT

00:51:14.305 --> 00:51:17.174 region:rollup2
IS APPROPRIATE NOT BECAUSE

00:51:16.607 --> 00:51:18.309 region:rollup2
SOMEONE SHOULD OR SHOULD NOT

00:51:17.174 --> 00:51:20.177 region:rollup2
PAY.

00:51:18.309 --> 00:51:22.580 region:rollup2
BUT BECAUSE ALL ASPECTS OF THE

00:51:20.177 --> 00:51:24.148 region:rollup2
PROBLEM NEED TO BE WORKED

00:51:22.580 --> 00:51:25.249 region:rollup2
DEFENSIBLE SPACE IS IMPORTANT.

00:51:24.148 --> 00:51:26.550 region:rollup2
INSURANCE AND THE INCENTIVES

00:51:25.249 --> 00:51:27.985 region:rollup2
THAT CREATES ARE SOME OF THE

00:51:26.550 --> 00:51:29.853 region:rollup2
STRONGEST.

00:51:27.985 --> 00:51:32.856 region:rollup2
METHODS FOR GETTING TO THE

00:51:29.853 --> 00:51:34.591 region:rollup2
PARCEL LEVEL AND HELPING PEOPLE.

00:51:32.856 --> 00:51:37.461 region:rollup2
TO MOBY MOTIVATED AND CONCERNED

00:51:34.591 --> 00:51:38.796 region:rollup2
WITH CREATING THAT SPACE.

00:51:37.461 --> 00:51:40.130 region:rollup2
BUT I THINK THE FIRST STEP IS TO

00:51:38.796 --> 00:51:41.565 region:rollup2
RECOGNIZE THAT THERE TO KIND OF

00:51:40.130 --> 00:51:43.167 region:rollup2
FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEMS ONE IS

00:51:41.565 --> 00:51:44.868 region:rollup2
EXISTING LIABILITIES AND THE

00:51:43.167 --> 00:51:46.070 region:rollup2
OTHER IS TO GO FORWARD PROBLEM

00:51:44.868 --> 00:51:47.504 region:rollup2
THE FUTURE LIABILITIES THAT

00:51:46.070 --> 00:51:48.639 region:rollup2
MIGHT BE CREATED AND AND IT'S

00:51:47.504 --> 00:51:50.140 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT.

00:51:48.639 --> 00:51:52.643 region:rollup2
TO ADDRESS THE EXISTING

00:51:50.140 --> 00:51:53.377 region:rollup2
LIABILITIES FIRST IN MY VIEW

00:51:52.643 --> 00:51:55.512 region:rollup2
BOTH BECAUSE THEY ARE REAL

00:51:53.377 --> 00:51:57.314 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN HARMED AND

00:51:55.512 --> 00:51:58.115 region:rollup2
OUR VICTIMS AND NEED TO BE MADE

00:51:57.314 --> 00:52:01.485 region:rollup2
WHOLE.

00:51:58.115 --> 00:52:02.987 region:rollup2
AND BECAUSE IT SIMPLIFIES.

00:52:01.485 --> 00:52:04.254 region:rollup2
POLITICAL THE POLITICAL ECONOMY

00:52:02.987 --> 00:52:06.190 region:rollup2
OF ADDRESSING THE GO FORWARD

00:52:04.254 --> 00:52:07.124 region:rollup2
PROBLEM WHICH IS IN FACT I THINK

00:52:06.190 --> 00:52:11.028 region:rollup2
CRITICAL TO THE FUTURE OF THE

00:52:07.124 --> 00:52:14.365 region:rollup2
INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES --

00:52:11.028 --> 00:52:15.132 region:rollup2
ONE PROPOSAL FOR THE EARLIER THE

00:52:14.365 --> 00:52:16.133 region:rollup2
TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND POTENTIALLY

00:52:15.132 --> 00:52:18.669 region:rollup2
EARLIER LIABILITY IS

00:52:16.133 --> 00:52:19.637 region:rollup2
SECURITIZATION AND WE'VE SEEN AB

00:52:18.669 --> 00:52:21.205 region:rollup2
THIRTY THREE INTRODUCED OR

00:52:19.637 --> 00:52:23.407 region:rollup2
AMENDED BY --

00:52:21.205 --> 00:52:24.308 region:rollup2
ASSEMBLY MEMBER QUIRK --

00:52:23.407 --> 00:52:26.076 region:rollup2
I THINK IT'S A PROMISING

00:52:24.308 --> 00:52:27.811 region:rollup2
PROPOSAL THAT HAS A NUMBER OF

00:52:26.076 --> 00:52:29.013 region:rollup2
KEY ON ANSWER QUESTIONS ONE IS.

00:52:27.811 --> 00:52:30.648 region:rollup2
WHAT'S THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT

00:52:29.013 --> 00:52:31.849 region:rollup2
SECURITIZED HOW MUCH OUR

00:52:30.648 --> 00:52:33.684 region:rollup2
RATEPAYERS GOING TO BE ON THE

00:52:31.849 --> 00:52:34.785 region:rollup2
HOOK FOR WHAT IS THE MAXIMUM

00:52:33.684 --> 00:52:35.285 region:rollup2
LEVEL THAT'S A BLANK SPOT IN THE

00:52:34.785 --> 00:52:36.453 region:rollup2
BILL.

00:52:35.285 --> 00:52:38.188 region:rollup2
ANOTHER IMPORTANT QUESTION IS

00:52:36.453 --> 00:52:39.957 region:rollup2
THE PROCESS FOR CREDITING RATE

00:52:38.188 --> 00:52:42.459 region:rollup2
PAYERS IF UTILITIES AT FAULT.

00:52:39.957 --> 00:52:43.527 region:rollup2
AND SOME GUIDANCE FROM THE

00:52:42.459 --> 00:52:45.696 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE IN THE LEGISLATURE ON

00:52:43.527 --> 00:52:49.833 region:rollup2
THE PROCESS IF A DISALLOWANCE

00:52:45.696 --> 00:52:51.335 region:rollup2
DOES NEED TO OCCUR.

00:52:49.833 --> 00:52:52.669 region:rollup2
THE GO FORWARD RISK FROM

00:52:51.335 --> 00:52:53.971 region:rollup2
WILDFIRES IS A MUCH MORE COMPLEX

00:52:52.669 --> 00:52:55.572 region:rollup2
ISSUE.

00:52:53.971 --> 00:52:56.840 region:rollup2
AND HERE I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT

00:52:55.572 --> 00:52:59.476 region:rollup2
TO SET EXPECTATIONS FOR THE

00:52:56.840 --> 00:53:01.779 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT.

00:52:59.476 --> 00:53:03.414 region:rollup2
EVERYONE IN THIS ROOM.

00:53:01.779 --> 00:53:05.849 region:rollup2
NEEDS TO START THINKING ABOUT

00:53:03.414 --> 00:53:06.450 region:rollup2
BUT MAY BE MORE COMPLEX THAN IS

00:53:05.849 --> 00:53:09.119 region:rollup2
FEASIBLE TO ADDRESS IN A MONTH

00:53:06.450 --> 00:53:11.622 region:rollup2
--

00:53:09.119 --> 00:53:12.990 region:rollup2
ONE POTENTIAL SOLUTION.

00:53:11.622 --> 00:53:14.425 region:rollup2
POR PART OF A SOLUTION I WOULD

00:53:12.990 --> 00:53:14.992 region:rollup2
I'M GONNA EXPLAIN WHY MEAN BY

00:53:14.425 --> 00:53:16.226 region:rollup2
THAT IS IN VERSE COMBINATION

00:53:14.992 --> 00:53:17.628 region:rollup2
REFORM.

00:53:16.226 --> 00:53:19.296 region:rollup2
FROM MY VIEW IF THAT'S GONNA

00:53:17.628 --> 00:53:20.364 region:rollup2
HAPPEN IS THAT THE BEST OPTION

00:53:19.296 --> 00:53:21.932 region:rollup2
IS TO MOVE AS THE GOVERNOR'S

00:53:20.364 --> 00:53:23.200 region:rollup2
PROPOSAL DOES FROM STRICT

00:53:21.932 --> 00:53:25.469 region:rollup2
LIABILITY TO A REASONABLE

00:53:23.200 --> 00:53:27.004 region:rollup2
STANDARD. FOR ALL ELECTRIC

00:53:25.469 --> 00:53:28.806 region:rollup2
UTILITIES BOTH PUBLIC AND INVEST

00:53:27.004 --> 00:53:31.542 region:rollup2
AROUND.

00:53:28.806 --> 00:53:33.544 region:rollup2
LIM DOT CHANGE TO WILDFIRES.

00:53:31.542 --> 00:53:35.512 region:rollup2
AND INSURE THAT THE UTILITIES

00:53:33.544 --> 00:53:37.347 region:rollup2
ARE STILL LIABLE IF THEY'RE

00:53:35.512 --> 00:53:39.316 region:rollup2
NEGLIGENT WHICH THEY SHOULD BE.

00:53:37.347 --> 00:53:40.617 region:rollup2
AS THEY A AND NOT THAT RECREATES

00:53:39.316 --> 00:53:42.186 region:rollup2
IN CALIFORNIA THE NATIONAL

00:53:40.617 --> 00:53:43.954 region:rollup2
STANDARD. FOR TO WHICH UTILITIES

00:53:42.186 --> 00:53:45.222 region:rollup2
ARE HELD.

00:53:43.954 --> 00:53:46.490 region:rollup2
MY VIEW IS THAT IT IS

00:53:45.222 --> 00:53:47.791 region:rollup2
CONSTITUTIONAL I'M HAPPY

00:53:46.490 --> 00:53:50.094 region:rollup2
EXPLAINING QUESTIONS ON WHY I

00:53:47.791 --> 00:53:51.862 region:rollup2
THINK THAT.

00:53:50.094 --> 00:53:53.964 region:rollup2
THE KEY ISSUE THOUGH.

00:53:51.862 --> 00:53:56.066 region:rollup2
THE ONE NOT ADDRESSED SO FAR IS

00:53:53.964 --> 00:53:58.068 region:rollup2
THAT OUT OF THAT MOVE ALLOCATES

00:53:56.066 --> 00:54:02.740 region:rollup2
RISK FROM UTILITIES. TO

00:53:58.068 --> 00:54:04.842 region:rollup2
HOMEOWNERS AND THEIR INSURERS --

00:54:02.740 --> 00:54:06.477 region:rollup2
ANOTHER PIECE OF THE STATE'S

00:54:04.842 --> 00:54:07.945 region:rollup2
POTENTIAL SOLUTION IS UTILITY

00:54:06.477 --> 00:54:10.347 region:rollup2
BETTER UTILITY WHILE ARE

00:54:07.945 --> 00:54:12.349 region:rollup2
PLANNING A COST RECOVERY.

00:54:10.347 --> 00:54:14.284 region:rollup2
WE HAVE TO REQUIRE UTILITIES TO

00:54:12.349 --> 00:54:14.818 region:rollup2
TAKE INNOVATIVE STEPS TO REDUCE

00:54:14.284 --> 00:54:16.086 region:rollup2
RISKS IN THE DISTRIBUTION

00:54:14.818 --> 00:54:16.987 region:rollup2
SYSTEM.

00:54:16.086 --> 00:54:19.356 region:rollup2
TO SOME DEGREE THIS IS ALREADY

00:54:16.987 --> 00:54:20.424 region:rollup2
HAPPENING VIA THE CPC PROCESS

00:54:19.356 --> 00:54:22.092 region:rollup2
AND AND FAST ACTION AT THE

00:54:20.424 --> 00:54:23.994 region:rollup2
COMMISSION.

00:54:22.092 --> 00:54:25.262 region:rollup2
ARE S. B. TEN EIGHTY EIGHT OR

00:54:23.994 --> 00:54:27.231 region:rollup2
THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL WHICH IS

00:54:25.262 --> 00:54:28.866 region:rollup2
MY I THINK IN SOME WAYS MODELED

00:54:27.231 --> 00:54:30.434 region:rollup2
ON TEN EIGHTY EIGHT WILL IF

00:54:28.866 --> 00:54:31.468 region:rollup2
ENACTED CREATE A SORT OF

00:54:30.434 --> 00:54:33.036 region:rollup2
CENTRALIZED PROCESS FOR DOING

00:54:31.468 --> 00:54:34.505 region:rollup2
THIS.

00:54:33.036 --> 00:54:36.106 region:rollup2
AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO

00:54:34.505 --> 00:54:38.275 region:rollup2
LOOK AT OTHER MODELS FOR

00:54:36.106 --> 00:54:39.843 region:rollup2
MANAGING RISK IN COMPLEX SYSTEMS

00:54:38.275 --> 00:54:42.112 region:rollup2
AND AT THE ENTERPRISE LEVEL.

00:54:39.843 --> 00:54:43.680 region:rollup2
AND TWO OF THE MOST IMPORTANT I

00:54:42.112 --> 00:54:44.848 region:rollup2
THINK OUR SARBANES OXLEY.

00:54:43.680 --> 00:54:46.183 region:rollup2
THE KILLER SECTION THREE OF TO

00:54:44.848 --> 00:54:48.619 region:rollup2
IN SECTION FOUR A FOR WHICH

00:54:46.183 --> 00:54:49.620 region:rollup2
REQUIRE CEO AND GENERAL COUNSEL

00:54:48.619 --> 00:54:51.321 region:rollup2
LEVEL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR RISK

00:54:49.620 --> 00:54:54.091 region:rollup2
MANAGEMENT.

00:54:51.321 --> 00:54:56.593 region:rollup2
AND THE NUCLEAR AND OIL INDUSTY

00:54:54.091 --> 00:54:57.561 region:rollup2
WHERE COMPLEX SYSTEMS.

00:54:56.593 --> 00:54:59.196 region:rollup2
SAFETY IN COMPLEX SYSTEMS IS A

00:54:57.561 --> 00:55:01.198 region:rollup2
CORE MISSION.

00:54:59.196 --> 00:55:02.499 region:rollup2
AND WHERE THERE'S A LOT OF

00:55:01.198 --> 00:55:04.201 region:rollup2
LEARNING THAT HAS BEEN DONE OVER

00:55:02.499 --> 00:55:04.735 region:rollup2
THE LAST SEVERAL DECADES THAT WE

00:55:04.201 --> 00:55:09.273 region:rollup2
COULD BENEFIT FROM AND THE

00:55:04.735 --> 00:55:10.841 region:rollup2
UTILITIES COULD --

00:55:09.273 --> 00:55:11.975 region:rollup2
A THIRD PIECE OF A POTENTIAL

00:55:10.841 --> 00:55:14.278 region:rollup2
SOLUTION AND ONE THAT WILL

00:55:11.975 --> 00:55:16.246 region:rollup2
BECOME ESSENTIAL IN MY VIEW.

00:55:14.278 --> 00:55:18.715 region:rollup2
IF INVERSE CONDEMNATION REFORM

00:55:16.246 --> 00:55:23.654 region:rollup2
WERE TO OCCUR IS REFORM OF

00:55:18.715 --> 00:55:25.489 region:rollup2
PROPERTY CASUALTY INSURERS.

00:55:23.654 --> 00:55:27.191 region:rollup2
WE WOULD NEED IS A STATE TO TAKE

00:55:25.489 --> 00:55:28.792 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT STEPS TO REDUCE THE

00:55:27.191 --> 00:55:30.961 region:rollup2
EXIT OF MAJOR INSURERS FROM THE

00:55:28.792 --> 00:55:33.664 region:rollup2
HOMEOWNERS MARKET.

00:55:30.961 --> 00:55:35.966 region:rollup2
IF WE SHIFT SIGNIFICANT WILDFIRE

00:55:33.664 --> 00:55:37.201 region:rollup2
RISK TOWARD HOMEOWNERS INSURERS

00:55:35.966 --> 00:55:38.202 region:rollup2
THAT IS A PROBLEM THAT IS

00:55:37.201 --> 00:55:39.937 region:rollup2
ALREADY HAPPENING ALREADY

00:55:38.202 --> 00:55:41.171 region:rollup2
BREWING WHERE I LIVE.

00:55:39.937 --> 00:55:42.739 region:rollup2
MANY OF THE LARGE INSURERS DO

00:55:41.171 --> 00:55:44.541 region:rollup2
NOT WRITE NEW POLICIES THAT IS

00:55:42.739 --> 00:55:45.809 region:rollup2
TRUE ACROSS LARGE FRACTIONS OF

00:55:44.541 --> 00:55:46.743 region:rollup2
THE STATE AT THIS POINT.

00:55:45.809 --> 00:55:48.245 region:rollup2
NONE OF THOSE INSURERS ARE

00:55:46.743 --> 00:55:49.546 region:rollup2
CANCELING POLICIES ARE REFUSING

00:55:48.245 --> 00:55:51.682 region:rollup2
TO RENEW.

00:55:49.546 --> 00:55:53.016 region:rollup2
BUT IF WE WERE TO SHIFT A

00:55:51.682 --> 00:55:54.718 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT CHUNK OF LIABILITY

00:55:53.016 --> 00:55:55.919 region:rollup2
IN THEIR DIRECTION GIVEN

00:55:54.718 --> 00:55:56.987 region:rollup2
PROPOSITION ONE OF THREE AND

00:55:55.919 --> 00:55:58.055 region:rollup2
THEIR INABILITY TO PRICE THE

00:55:56.987 --> 00:55:59.489 region:rollup2
RISK.

00:55:58.055 --> 00:56:02.192 region:rollup2
THAT IS A FEASIBLE OUTCOME IF

00:55:59.489 --> 00:56:03.427 region:rollup2
YOU LIMIT PRICE THE RESPONSE OF

00:56:02.192 --> 00:56:04.561 region:rollup2
THE MARKET IS TO LIMIT SUPPLY

00:56:03.427 --> 00:56:06.597 region:rollup2
WE'RESEEING A LITTLE BIT ABOUT

00:56:04.561 --> 00:56:08.465 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW WE CAN SEE MUCH MORE

00:56:06.597 --> 00:56:10.267 region:rollup2
IF IF THE STATE ISN'T CAREFUL.

00:56:08.465 --> 00:56:11.134 region:rollup2
TOM I THINK A LOT OF THINKING

00:56:10.267 --> 00:56:12.936 region:rollup2
NEEDS TO GO ON HERE THAT'S A

00:56:11.134 --> 00:56:13.570 region:rollup2
VERY COMPLEX ISSUE WITH VERY

00:56:12.936 --> 00:56:14.705 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT POLITICS IN THE ENERGY

00:56:13.570 --> 00:56:15.739 region:rollup2
SYSTEM.

00:56:14.705 --> 00:56:17.174 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S PART OF THE REASON

00:56:15.739 --> 00:56:19.209 region:rollup2
THAT I VIEW THIS LIABILITY

00:56:17.174 --> 00:56:21.111 region:rollup2
REFORM ISSUE IS MORE COMPLEX

00:56:19.209 --> 00:56:21.545 region:rollup2
THAN THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN

00:56:21.111 --> 00:56:24.982 region:rollup2
LIABILITY.

00:56:21.545 --> 00:56:25.515 region:rollup2
AND THE AND TO SOME DEGREE ARE

00:56:24.982 --> 00:56:28.952 region:rollup2
CLARIFICATION OF THE COST

00:56:25.515 --> 00:56:30.320 region:rollup2
RECOVERY PROCESS --

00:56:28.952 --> 00:56:32.022 region:rollup2
ANOTHER PIECE OF THE PUZZLE THIS

00:56:30.320 --> 00:56:34.892 region:rollup2
IS MY TOWN.

00:56:32.022 --> 00:56:35.492 region:rollup2
ON A BAD DAY IN.

00:56:34.892 --> 00:56:36.126 region:rollup2
NINETEEN TWENTY NINE BUT PRINT

00:56:35.492 --> 00:56:37.561 region:rollup2
THAT WE HOPE NEVER OCCURS AGAIN

00:56:36.126 --> 00:56:39.730 region:rollup2
--

00:56:37.561 --> 00:56:40.797 region:rollup2
FOR FIRE.

00:56:39.730 --> 00:56:42.532 region:rollup2
WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT

00:56:40.797 --> 00:56:44.034 region:rollup2
VEGETATION MANAGEMENT NOT JUST

00:56:42.532 --> 00:56:46.003 region:rollup2
IN A CONTROL BURKE CONTEXT BUT

00:56:44.034 --> 00:56:47.604 region:rollup2
WHERE PEOPLE LIVE.

00:56:46.003 --> 00:56:48.438 region:rollup2
CURRENT NON UTILITY VEGETATION

00:56:47.604 --> 00:56:49.773 region:rollup2
MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

00:56:48.438 --> 00:56:52.109 region:rollup2
DISPROPORTIONATE ON PUBLIC LANDS

00:56:49.773 --> 00:56:54.011 region:rollup2
AND SPARSELY POPULATED AREAS

00:56:52.109 --> 00:56:56.613 region:rollup2
THAT NEEDS TO CHANGE IF WE ARE

00:56:54.011 --> 00:56:58.015 region:rollup2
GOING TO REDUCE RISK --

00:56:56.613 --> 00:56:59.283 region:rollup2
I HAVE A NUMBER OF AYE THOUGHTS

00:56:58.015 --> 00:57:01.084 region:rollup2
ABOUT THAT --

00:56:59.283 --> 00:57:02.886 region:rollup2
BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT ONE

00:57:01.084 --> 00:57:04.021 region:rollup2
PROBABLY IS TO RECOGNIZE THAT

00:57:02.886 --> 00:57:05.155 region:rollup2
THIS IS A COLLECTIVE ACTION

00:57:04.021 --> 00:57:06.323 region:rollup2
PROBLEM THAT NEEDS TO BE

00:57:05.155 --> 00:57:07.457 region:rollup2
ADDRESSED THE COMMUNITY LEVEL.

00:57:06.323 --> 00:57:13.730 region:rollup2
AND THAT CARROTS ARE MORE LIKELY

00:57:07.457 --> 00:57:15.232 region:rollup2
TO BE EFFECTIVE AND STATE --

00:57:13.730 --> 00:57:17.401 region:rollup2
WELL I JUST SAID THAT DEFENSIBLE

00:57:15.232 --> 00:57:19.069 region:rollup2
SPACE IN MANY VERY FINE HIGH

00:57:17.401 --> 00:57:21.204 region:rollup2
FIRE HAZARD SEVERITY ZONES.

00:57:19.069 --> 00:57:23.073 region:rollup2
IS LARGELY NONEXISTENT.

00:57:21.204 --> 00:57:23.640 region:rollup2
THIS A PICTURE SAUSALITO ONE OF

00:57:23.073 --> 00:57:25.375 region:rollup2
THE PLACES WHERE STATE FARM

00:57:23.640 --> 00:57:27.144 region:rollup2
INSURANCE THAT'S NOT RIGHT NEW

00:57:25.375 --> 00:57:28.912 region:rollup2
POLICIES AND YOU CAN SEE EXACTLY

00:57:27.144 --> 00:57:30.147 region:rollup2
WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE.

00:57:28.912 --> 00:57:32.649 region:rollup2
VERY HIGH VALUE REAL ESTATE.

00:57:30.147 --> 00:57:34.518 region:rollup2
NO DEFENSIBLE SPACE LOT OF OLD

00:57:32.649 --> 00:57:36.620 region:rollup2
STRUCTURES WITH SHINGLE SIDING.

00:57:34.518 --> 00:57:38.722 region:rollup2
THAT IS A TINDERBOX WITH MANY

00:57:36.620 --> 00:57:40.557 region:rollup2
LIVES AT RISK DENSELY POPULATED

00:57:38.722 --> 00:57:42.392 region:rollup2
URBAN COMMUNITY.

00:57:40.557 --> 00:57:44.995 region:rollup2
COULD BE JUST LIKE COFFEE PARK

00:57:42.392 --> 00:57:47.230 region:rollup2
ON A BAD DAY --

00:57:44.995 --> 00:57:49.066 region:rollup2
WE NEED INSPECTION EDUCATION

00:57:47.230 --> 00:57:50.801 region:rollup2
FINANCIAL INCENTIVES.

00:57:49.066 --> 00:57:52.302 region:rollup2
AND POTENTIALLY ASSISTANCE TO

00:57:50.801 --> 00:57:53.670 region:rollup2
HOMEOWNERS TO HELP THEM CUT DOWN

00:57:52.302 --> 00:57:55.339 region:rollup2
TREES THAT THEY MIGHT OTHERWISE

00:57:53.670 --> 00:57:57.174 region:rollup2
HAVE A HARD TIME AFFORDING TO

00:57:55.339 --> 00:57:57.774 region:rollup2
HELP PAY FOR THAT BARBAROUS WORK

00:57:57.174 --> 00:58:00.243 region:rollup2
IT'S GONNA KEEP THE COMMUNITY

00:57:57.774 --> 00:58:01.445 region:rollup2
SAFE --

00:58:00.243 --> 00:58:02.379 region:rollup2
FINALLY AND MAYBE THIS IS THE

00:58:01.445 --> 00:58:04.281 region:rollup2
HARDEST ISSUE [inaudible]

00:58:02.379 --> 00:58:06.016 region:rollup2
ARE.

00:58:04.281 --> 00:58:06.883 region:rollup2
LANCE LIMITING LAND USE

00:58:06.016 --> 00:58:09.252 region:rollup2
EXPANSION INTO THE WILDLAND

00:58:06.883 --> 00:58:10.821 region:rollup2
URBAN INTERFACE BECAUSE OF THE

00:58:09.252 --> 00:58:12.990 region:rollup2
RISKS BECAUSE OF THE COSTS

00:58:10.821 --> 00:58:13.724 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY SOCIETY IS SOCIALIZING

00:58:12.990 --> 00:58:17.561 region:rollup2
OF COSTS.

00:58:13.724 --> 00:58:19.563 region:rollup2
EITHER IN RATES OR IN --

00:58:17.561 --> 00:58:20.864 region:rollup2
OR VIA TAXPAYER FUNDING OF

00:58:19.563 --> 00:58:21.164 region:rollup2
FIREFIGHTER RESPONSE COSTS

00:58:20.864 --> 00:58:25.035 region:rollup2
[inaudible]

00:58:21.164 --> 00:58:27.704 region:rollup2
AND SOUND CLIMATE ADAPTATION AND

00:58:25.035 --> 00:58:30.006 region:rollup2
RISK MANAGEMENT DICTATES RETREAT

00:58:27.704 --> 00:58:32.509 region:rollup2
FROM SOME OF THESE AREAS.

00:58:30.006 --> 00:58:34.778 region:rollup2
AND AT A MINIMUM IMPOSING SOME

00:58:32.509 --> 00:58:36.747 region:rollup2
OF THE COSTS ON THOSE AREAS THAT

00:58:34.778 --> 00:58:38.048 region:rollup2
THEY CREATE.

00:58:36.747 --> 00:58:40.951 region:rollup2
THAT IS A VERY DIFFICULT

00:58:38.048 --> 00:58:42.819 region:rollup2
POLITICAL PROBLEM WE'VE SEEN.

00:58:40.951 --> 00:58:44.154 region:rollup2
EXAMPLES OF IT PLAY OUT IN THE

00:58:42.819 --> 00:58:44.755 region:rollup2
FLOOD INSURANCE CONTACTS OR

00:58:44.154 --> 00:58:46.623 region:rollup2
HAVEN'T MADE A LOT OF PROGRESS

00:58:44.755 --> 00:58:48.058 region:rollup2
--

00:58:46.623 --> 00:58:50.927 region:rollup2
OTHER STATES HAVE MADE A LOT OF

00:58:48.058 --> 00:58:52.629 region:rollup2
PROGRESS WITH RESPECT TO WINDS

00:58:50.927 --> 00:58:54.331 region:rollup2
DAMAGES AND WIND INSURANCE I

00:58:52.629 --> 00:58:55.832 region:rollup2
WOULD RECOMMEND THE COMMITTEE

00:58:54.331 --> 00:58:57.601 region:rollup2
LOOK AT THE EXPERIENCE OF THE

00:58:55.832 --> 00:58:59.436 region:rollup2
SOUTHEASTERN UNITED STATES.

00:58:57.601 --> 00:59:00.971 region:rollup2
IN ADDRESSING THIS ISSUE THERE A

00:58:59.436 --> 00:59:01.972 region:rollup2
LOT OF SURPRISINGLY PROGRESSIVE

00:59:00.971 --> 00:59:03.106 region:rollup2
POLICIES COMING OUT OF VERY

00:59:01.972 --> 00:59:04.508 region:rollup2
CONSERVATIVE STATES TO DEAL WITH

00:59:03.106 --> 00:59:06.276 region:rollup2
THIS PROBLEM.

00:59:04.508 --> 00:59:08.445 region:rollup2
AND I THINK IT'S ANOTHER THIS IS

00:59:06.276 --> 00:59:10.414 region:rollup2
ANOTHER.

00:59:08.445 --> 00:59:12.816 region:rollup2
VERSION OF THAT.

00:59:10.414 --> 00:59:14.885 region:rollup2
WE HAVE PUT PEOPLE IN HARM'S WAY

00:59:12.816 --> 00:59:15.919 region:rollup2
VIA A WHOLE SLEW OF POLICIES

00:59:14.885 --> 00:59:17.454 region:rollup2
THAT WERE WELL INTENDED OVER THE

00:59:15.919 --> 00:59:19.256 region:rollup2
LAST HUNDRED YEARS.

00:59:17.454 --> 00:59:20.557 region:rollup2
AND WE NEED TO HELP THEM STAY

00:59:19.256 --> 00:59:23.393 region:rollup2
OUT OF HARMS WAY BUT ALSO NOT

00:59:20.557 --> 00:59:24.628 region:rollup2
MAKE THE PROBLEM WORSE --

00:59:23.393 --> 00:59:27.597 region:rollup2
SO THERE'S A WHOLE SET OF THINGS

00:59:24.628 --> 00:59:30.066 region:rollup2
UC A COMPLEX MENU.

00:59:27.597 --> 00:59:31.535 region:rollup2
I THINK WOULD BE REQUIRED TO

00:59:30.066 --> 00:59:33.470 region:rollup2
FULLY ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM I

00:59:31.535 --> 00:59:35.705 region:rollup2
HOPE THAT THE COMMITTEE CAN MAKE

00:59:33.470 --> 00:59:37.707 region:rollup2
A VERY GOOD START PERHAPS

00:59:35.705 --> 00:59:39.776 region:rollup2
ACCOMPLISH SOME OF THE EARLY

00:59:37.707 --> 00:59:40.777 region:rollup2
ISSUES THAT THE SIMPLER PROBLEMS

00:59:39.776 --> 00:59:42.612 region:rollup2
NOW.

00:59:40.777 --> 00:59:44.147 region:rollup2
AND MAYBE GET A VERY SIGNIFICANT

00:59:42.612 --> 00:59:44.681 region:rollup2
SUBSTANTIVE BEGINNING AND START

00:59:44.147 --> 00:59:47.751 region:rollup2
TO THE CONVERSATION ON THE

00:59:44.681 --> 00:59:49.119 region:rollup2
HARDER ONES --

00:59:47.751 --> 00:59:50.687 region:rollup2
I JUST IF I SAID TO THEIR TWO

00:59:49.119 --> 00:59:51.888 region:rollup2
SETS OF ISSUES ONCE TRACTABLE

00:59:50.687 --> 00:59:52.856 region:rollup2
PERHAPS IN A MONTH.

00:59:51.888 --> 00:59:54.257 region:rollup2
ANOTHER MAY.

00:59:52.856 --> 00:59:56.193 region:rollup2
TAKE MORE TIME.

00:59:54.257 --> 00:59:59.429 region:rollup2
IT'S GOOD TO HAVE SURGICAL BUT

00:59:56.193 --> 01:00:00.163 region:rollup2
IT'S A STRETCH GOAL. TO RESOLVE

00:59:59.429 --> 01:00:00.997 region:rollup2
THE LIABILITY QUESTION IN MY

01:00:00.163 --> 01:00:02.265 region:rollup2
VIEW.

01:00:00.997 --> 01:00:04.134 region:rollup2
AND I WOULD ALSO JUST EMPHASIZE

01:00:02.265 --> 01:00:05.902 region:rollup2
ONE THING ARE.

01:00:04.134 --> 01:00:07.938 region:rollup2
THAT THAT THAT IN CONCLUDING.

01:00:05.902 --> 01:00:09.372 region:rollup2
THERE TO HAVE POLITICAL

01:00:07.938 --> 01:00:10.774 region:rollup2
CONCLUSIONS THAT I'VE HEARD.

01:00:09.372 --> 01:00:12.008 region:rollup2
IN THIS CONVERSATION FROM THE

01:00:10.774 --> 01:00:12.609 region:rollup2
ELECTRICITY CRISIS AND I THINK

01:00:12.008 --> 01:00:14.544 region:rollup2
THEY'RE BOTH WORTH BEARING IN

01:00:12.609 --> 01:00:16.513 region:rollup2
MIND ONE IS DON'T LET UTILITIES

01:00:14.544 --> 01:00:18.448 region:rollup2
GO BANKRUPT.

01:00:16.513 --> 01:00:19.583 region:rollup2
AND WE'VE HEARD THAT THE CEO A

01:00:18.448 --> 01:00:21.084 region:rollup2
P. GENIE HAS MENTIONED

01:00:19.583 --> 01:00:23.086 region:rollup2
BANKRUPTCY ON AN EARNINGS CALL

01:00:21.084 --> 01:00:24.588 region:rollup2
SHAREHOLDERS THAT'S AN UNUSUAL

01:00:23.086 --> 01:00:28.625 region:rollup2
THING FOR CEO TO SAY.

01:00:24.588 --> 01:00:29.559 region:rollup2
OUR TO HURT SHAREHOLDERS --

01:00:28.625 --> 01:00:31.595 region:rollup2
THE OTHER THOUGH IS EQUALLY

01:00:29.559 --> 01:00:33.997 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT BEWARE THE UNINTENDED

01:00:31.595 --> 01:00:35.665 region:rollup2
CONSEQUENCES OF COMPLEX CHANGES

01:00:33.997 --> 01:00:37.767 region:rollup2
HASTILY MADE.

01:00:35.665 --> 01:00:40.403 region:rollup2
RIGHT BEFORE THERE WAS A UTILITY

01:00:37.767 --> 01:00:42.339 region:rollup2
BANKRUPTCY THERE WAS.

01:00:40.403 --> 01:00:44.274 region:rollup2
RESTRUCTURING OF ELECTRICITY

01:00:42.339 --> 01:00:45.509 region:rollup2
SYSTEM IN A MANNER THAT.

01:00:44.274 --> 01:00:48.445 region:rollup2
TURNED OUT TO BE UNWISE AND

01:00:45.509 --> 01:00:50.814 region:rollup2
DIDN'T FULLY TAKE ACCOUNT OF THE

01:00:48.445 --> 01:00:51.448 region:rollup2
COMPLEXITY OF THE SYSTEM AND THE

01:00:50.814 --> 01:00:53.183 region:rollup2
COMPLEXITY OF THE CHANGES BEING

01:00:51.448 --> 01:00:55.352 region:rollup2
UNDERTAKE.

01:00:53.183 --> 01:00:59.623 region:rollup2
BOTH APPLY HERE.

01:00:55.352 --> 01:01:01.258 region:rollup2
AND I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU --

01:00:59.623 --> 01:01:02.559 region:rollup2
TO HELP TO KEEP CALIFORNIANS

01:01:01.258 --> 01:01:04.394 region:rollup2
SAFE AND TO DO THE WORK THAT WE

01:01:02.559 --> 01:01:06.129 region:rollup2
CAN DO THIS YEAR TO KEEP

01:01:04.394 --> 01:01:07.030 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIANS SAFE AND TO MAKE

01:01:06.129 --> 01:01:09.232 region:rollup2
THEM WHOLE.

01:01:07.030 --> 01:01:11.635 region:rollup2
AND BUT ALSO TO BEAR IN MIND

01:01:09.232 --> 01:01:12.802 region:rollup2
THAT SOLVING A PROBLEM IN THE

01:01:11.635 --> 01:01:15.171 region:rollup2
ELECTRIC UTILITY SYSTEM BY

01:01:12.802 --> 01:01:17.073 region:rollup2
CREATING ONE SOMEWHERE ELSE MAY

01:01:15.171 --> 01:01:17.874 region:rollup2
NOT SERVE ANYONE'S INTERESTS.

01:01:17.073 --> 01:01:21.778 region:rollup2
SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I'M

01:01:17.874 --> 01:01:23.113 region:rollup2
HAPPY TO TAKE YOUR THANK YOU

01:01:21.778 --> 01:01:25.682 region:rollup2
VERY MUCH I I'VE I'VE GOT ONE

01:01:23.113 --> 01:01:27.484 region:rollup2
QUESTION THAT I I YOU TALK ABOUT

01:01:25.682 --> 01:01:30.987 region:rollup2
THAT THE CONCEPT OF SECURITIZED

01:01:27.484 --> 01:01:32.122 region:rollup2
INVESTOR OBLIGATIONS --

01:01:30.987 --> 01:01:33.657 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW.

01:01:32.122 --> 01:01:34.291 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW ACTUALLY TALK ABOUT.

01:01:33.657 --> 01:01:39.329 region:rollup2
SECURITIZED AIMED AT AS AND A B.

01:01:34.291 --> 01:01:39.930 region:rollup2
--

01:01:39.329 --> 01:01:44.000 region:rollup2
THIRTY THREE I GUESS WHAT I'M

01:01:39.930 --> 01:01:46.770 region:rollup2
WONDERING IS IS.

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:48.171 region:rollup2
CAN YOU SECURE TIES [inaudible]

01:01:46.770 --> 01:01:50.473 region:rollup2
THE INVESTOR.

01:01:48.171 --> 01:01:51.942 region:rollup2
PORTION OF IT.

01:01:50.473 --> 01:01:54.778 region:rollup2
IF IT WAS A HIGH BRED WHICH IS

01:01:51.942 --> 01:01:55.645 region:rollup2
SAY OF AB.

01:01:54.778 --> 01:01:57.047 region:rollup2
THIRTY THREE AND THERE WAS A

01:01:55.645 --> 01:01:59.416 region:rollup2
CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF THAT THAT

01:01:57.047 --> 01:02:00.550 region:rollup2
WE FELT WAS NECESSARY. TO TO

01:01:59.416 --> 01:02:02.118 region:rollup2
STAY WITH THE INVESTOR OWNED

01:02:00.550 --> 01:02:03.954 region:rollup2
UTILITY.

01:02:02.118 --> 01:02:05.422 region:rollup2
AND SOME PORTION WITH THE

01:02:03.954 --> 01:02:07.290 region:rollup2
RATEPAYERS I'M WONDERING WHAT

01:02:05.422 --> 01:02:07.724 region:rollup2
THE MECHANISM.

01:02:07.290 --> 01:02:11.061 region:rollup2
COULD POSSIBLY BE TO

01:02:07.724 --> 01:02:11.595 region:rollup2
SECURITIZED.

01:02:11.061 --> 01:02:12.829 region:rollup2
TO HELP THE INVESTOR SO IT

01:02:11.595 --> 01:02:14.397 region:rollup2
DOESN'T [inaudible]

01:02:12.829 --> 01:02:15.498 region:rollup2
AT YELLOW.

01:02:14.397 --> 01:02:19.436 region:rollup2
PERHAPS TAKEN INTO BANKRUPTCY IF

01:02:15.498 --> 01:02:21.271 region:rollup2
THAT'S THE WORRY AFTER WE I HAVE

01:02:19.436 --> 01:02:23.006 region:rollup2
THIS THIS DAY IS CONCLUDED WHAT

01:02:21.271 --> 01:02:25.075 region:rollup2
WHAT WHAT DO YOU SEE THIS AS FAR

01:02:23.006 --> 01:02:26.543 region:rollup2
AS A PROCESS IN THAT REGARD.

01:02:25.075 --> 01:02:28.078 region:rollup2
WELL I THINK I THINK THE

01:02:26.543 --> 01:02:29.379 region:rollup2
PROPOSAL THAT'S BEEN PUT FORWARD

01:02:28.078 --> 01:02:30.814 region:rollup2
IS A REASONABLE ONE IT'S A ONE

01:02:29.379 --> 01:02:31.881 region:rollup2
THAT IT'S ONE THAT HAS A TRACK

01:02:30.814 --> 01:02:33.583 region:rollup2
RECORD THAT DATES BACK TO THE

01:02:31.881 --> 01:02:35.919 region:rollup2
ELECTRICITY CRISIS WE ALL PAY

01:02:33.583 --> 01:02:36.720 region:rollup2
ARGUE W. ARE BOND CHARGE ON OUR

01:02:35.919 --> 01:02:39.122 region:rollup2
ELECTRICITY BILL --

01:02:36.720 --> 01:02:42.926 region:rollup2
FOR BETTER OR WORSE --

01:02:39.122 --> 01:02:44.461 region:rollup2
AND IN MY VIEW STE

01:02:42.926 --> 01:02:46.329 region:rollup2
SECURITIZATION WAS TRADITION

01:02:44.461 --> 01:02:48.565 region:rollup2
REALLY DOES IS SPREAD THE COSTS

01:02:46.329 --> 01:02:49.933 region:rollup2
OUT OVER TIME. TO THE DEGREE

01:02:48.565 --> 01:02:51.234 region:rollup2
THAT IT'S PROBLEMATIC WHAT'S

01:02:49.933 --> 01:02:53.069 region:rollup2
PROBLEMATIC ABOUT IT IS THAT

01:02:51.234 --> 01:02:54.471 region:rollup2
YOU'RE IMPOSING COSTS.

01:02:53.069 --> 01:02:55.772 region:rollup2
THAT ARE CREATED BY CURRENT RATE

01:02:54.471 --> 01:02:57.107 region:rollup2
PAYERS AND THE UTILITY TO

01:02:55.772 --> 01:02:58.808 region:rollup2
CURRENT UTILITY ON FUTURE RATE

01:02:57.107 --> 01:03:00.010 region:rollup2
PAYERS WHO MAYBE DIDN'T DO

01:02:58.808 --> 01:03:01.611 region:rollup2
ANYTHING TO CAUSE THIS PROBLEM

01:03:00.010 --> 01:03:03.413 region:rollup2
OR CREATE THIS PROBLEM.

01:03:01.611 --> 01:03:05.715 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT.

01:03:03.413 --> 01:03:07.751 region:rollup2
SECURITIZATION WOULD DO MUCH TO

01:03:05.715 --> 01:03:09.819 region:rollup2
CALM SOME OF THE MARKETING IS IT

01:03:07.751 --> 01:03:10.887 region:rollup2
THAT APPEARS TO EXIST AROUND THE

01:03:09.819 --> 01:03:12.555 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA INVESTOR OWNED

01:03:10.887 --> 01:03:13.123 region:rollup2
UTILITIES AND YOU SEE THAT IN

01:03:12.555 --> 01:03:14.124 region:rollup2
THE STATEMENTS OF THE RATING

01:03:13.123 --> 01:03:16.993 region:rollup2
AGENCIES [inaudible]

01:03:14.124 --> 01:03:18.828 region:rollup2
ALSO THE THE PRIVATE

01:03:16.993 --> 01:03:20.096 region:rollup2
CONVERSATIONS AND AND ANALYST

01:03:18.828 --> 01:03:20.730 region:rollup2
REPORTS FROM FROM THE FOLKS THAT

01:03:20.096 --> 01:03:23.600 region:rollup2
OWN.

01:03:20.730 --> 01:03:24.567 region:rollup2
OUR UTILITIES --

01:03:23.600 --> 01:03:26.536 region:rollup2
IT WOULD IT WOULD GIVE SOME

01:03:24.567 --> 01:03:29.039 region:rollup2
CONFIDENCE THAT.

01:03:26.536 --> 01:03:31.141 region:rollup2
THE UTILITIES --

01:03:29.039 --> 01:03:32.509 region:rollup2
THEY TILDE CONCERNS ARE TAKEN

01:03:31.141 --> 01:03:34.644 region:rollup2
SERIOUS AT IN THIS FACT THIS

01:03:32.509 --> 01:03:37.647 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE EVEN EXISTS GIVES SOME

01:03:34.644 --> 01:03:38.848 region:rollup2
CONFERENCE ON TO THAT --

01:03:37.647 --> 01:03:41.518 region:rollup2
THE PROBLEM WITH IT IS IT'S A

01:03:38.848 --> 01:03:42.819 region:rollup2
ONE OFF SOLUTION.

01:03:41.518 --> 01:03:44.821 region:rollup2
RIGHT IT MAKES PEOPLE HOLE IT

01:03:42.819 --> 01:03:46.956 region:rollup2
WOULD MEAN THAT.

01:03:44.821 --> 01:03:48.692 region:rollup2
P. JEANNIE COULD SETTLE --

01:03:46.956 --> 01:03:51.327 region:rollup2
PERHAPS SOME OF THEIR LAWSUITS

01:03:48.692 --> 01:03:53.563 region:rollup2
AND AND AND AND PAVE THE

01:03:51.327 --> 01:03:55.932 region:rollup2
UNDERINSURED AND UNINSURED

01:03:53.563 --> 01:03:56.866 region:rollup2
LIABILITIES FASTER RIGHT THE

01:03:55.932 --> 01:03:59.002 region:rollup2
INSURANCE COMPANIES PARTY PAID.

01:03:56.866 --> 01:04:00.870 region:rollup2
OR ARE PAYING MUCH OF THE

01:03:59.002 --> 01:04:01.871 region:rollup2
INSURED LOS --

01:04:00.870 --> 01:04:03.940 region:rollup2
I'M LESS CONCERNED THAT THEY GET

01:04:01.871 --> 01:04:04.474 region:rollup2
THEIR MONEY QUICKLY --

01:04:03.940 --> 01:04:06.509 region:rollup2
I THINK WE SHOULD BE LESS

01:04:04.474 --> 01:04:10.480 region:rollup2
CONCERNED --

01:04:06.509 --> 01:04:11.881 region:rollup2
BUT THE THE BIG QUESTION AROUND

01:04:10.480 --> 01:04:14.017 region:rollup2
I THINK THE BIG QUESTION AROUND

01:04:11.881 --> 01:04:15.719 region:rollup2
THIS IS HOW THE CREDITING.

01:04:14.017 --> 01:04:17.420 region:rollup2
RIGHT SO IF WE WERE TO SAY THAT

01:04:15.719 --> 01:04:19.756 region:rollup2
IF THE FIRM SECURITIZED IS THE

01:04:17.420 --> 01:04:20.757 region:rollup2
RISK -- AND

01:04:19.756 --> 01:04:24.060 region:rollup2
IT TURNS OUT [inaudible]

01:04:20.757 --> 01:04:26.396 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:04:24.060 --> 01:04:27.797 region:rollup2
TABS OR OR ANOTHER YOU KNOW OR

01:04:26.396 --> 01:04:29.532 region:rollup2
TALK HIGHWAYS THOMAS ISN'T IN

01:04:27.797 --> 01:04:31.000 region:rollup2
THIS BECAUSE IT'S I ONLY CAN

01:04:29.532 --> 01:04:33.203 region:rollup2
TURN SPEAKING AT THIS POINT.

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:36.172 region:rollup2
BUT IF THE TUBS FIRE WERE --

01:04:33.203 --> 01:04:39.275 region:rollup2
ATTRIBUTABLE --

01:04:36.172 --> 01:04:40.844 region:rollup2
TO P. GENIES IMPRUDENCE --

01:04:39.275 --> 01:04:43.213 region:rollup2
HOW WOULD THAT CREDITING TAKE

01:04:40.844 --> 01:04:44.347 region:rollup2
PLACE OVER WHAT TIME FRAME WOULD

01:04:43.213 --> 01:04:46.149 region:rollup2
RATE PAYERS BECOME UNSEATED

01:04:44.347 --> 01:04:47.550 region:rollup2
WOULD BE OVER THE EXTENDED TIME

01:04:46.149 --> 01:04:52.389 region:rollup2
FRAME THAT WOULD TEND TO GIVE?

01:04:47.550 --> 01:04:54.791 region:rollup2
THE OWNERS OF THE COMPANY --

01:04:52.389 --> 01:04:56.793 region:rollup2
THE BENEFIT OF THAT TIME VALUE

01:04:54.791 --> 01:04:58.394 region:rollup2
OF MONEY --

01:04:56.793 --> 01:04:59.696 region:rollup2
AND WOOD HELP TO CALM THEM IN

01:04:58.394 --> 01:05:01.131 region:rollup2
TERMS OF THIS SORT OF PERCEIVED

01:04:59.696 --> 01:05:02.465 region:rollup2
CRISIS.

01:05:01.131 --> 01:05:04.801 region:rollup2
IT WOULD ALSO POTENTIALLY

01:05:02.465 --> 01:05:06.870 region:rollup2
BENEFIT RATEPAYERS IN TERMS OF

01:05:04.801 --> 01:05:08.004 region:rollup2
RETURN ON EQUITY --

01:05:06.870 --> 01:05:09.005 region:rollup2
THAT THAT THAT THERE WILL BE

01:05:08.004 --> 01:05:10.206 region:rollup2
ACOSTA CAPITAL PROCEEDING

01:05:09.005 --> 01:05:12.008 region:rollup2
EVENTUALLY FOR ALL OF THE

01:05:10.206 --> 01:05:13.910 region:rollup2
UTILITIES AND IF THEY ARE

01:05:12.008 --> 01:05:14.944 region:rollup2
EXPOSED TO THIS RISK FULY.

01:05:13.910 --> 01:05:16.279 region:rollup2
THERE'S LIKELY TO BE A MUCH

01:05:14.944 --> 01:05:17.080 region:rollup2
HIGHER COST OF CAPITAL MOVING

01:05:16.279 --> 01:05:18.014 region:rollup2
FORWARD.

01:05:17.080 --> 01:05:18.314 region:rollup2
AND THEN THERE IS NOW

01:05:18.014 --> 01:05:21.651 region:rollup2
[inaudible]

01:05:18.314 --> 01:05:23.553 region:rollup2
BUT THE KEY ISSUE THERE IS

01:05:21.651 --> 01:05:24.754 region:rollup2
CLARIFICATION ON HOW HOW TO PAY

01:05:23.553 --> 01:05:26.423 region:rollup2
BACK WHAT HAPPENS IF THIS WERE

01:05:24.754 --> 01:05:29.793 region:rollup2
ALLOWED.

01:05:26.423 --> 01:05:31.661 region:rollup2
PRIOR TO A FINDING APPROVED FIVE

01:05:29.793 --> 01:05:33.229 region:rollup2
FINDING IT PRETTY FIVE PRIOR TO

01:05:31.661 --> 01:05:34.564 region:rollup2
CONCLUSION OUT THE FULL CPUC

01:05:33.229 --> 01:05:37.300 region:rollup2
PROCESS.

01:05:34.564 --> 01:05:38.368 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD OTHERWISE OCCUR.

01:05:37.300 --> 01:05:39.402 region:rollup2
I GUESS THE I GUESS THE QUESTION

01:05:38.368 --> 01:05:40.937 region:rollup2
AND AND IT MAYBE WE DON'T HAVE

01:05:39.402 --> 01:05:42.305 region:rollup2
THE ANSWER NOW WE WE'RE GONNA

01:05:40.937 --> 01:05:43.106 region:rollup2
HAVE TO FIND THIS OUT.

01:05:42.305 --> 01:05:43.406 region:rollup2
YOU AT SOME POINT TIME

01:05:43.106 --> 01:05:45.942 region:rollup2
[inaudible]

01:05:43.406 --> 01:05:48.411 region:rollup2
YEAH IT'S EITHER CREDIT BACK

01:05:45.942 --> 01:05:49.946 region:rollup2
[inaudible] TO TO THE RATE

01:05:48.411 --> 01:05:53.283 region:rollup2
PAYERS OR SIMPLY.

01:05:49.946 --> 01:05:55.218 region:rollup2
THE UTILITY PAINT THAT SHARE.

01:05:53.283 --> 01:05:56.119 region:rollup2
YES OF THE SECURITIZATION YES

01:05:55.218 --> 01:05:56.486 region:rollup2
EITHER ONE WOULD BE FEASIBLE

01:05:56.119 --> 01:05:59.522 region:rollup2
YEAH [inaudible]

01:05:56.486 --> 01:06:00.824 region:rollup2
THANK YOU.

01:05:59.522 --> 01:06:01.524 region:rollup2
ASSEMBLYMEMBER WOULD.

01:06:00.824 --> 01:06:02.425 region:rollup2
YEAH THANK YOU VERY MUCH

01:06:01.524 --> 01:06:04.861 region:rollup2
REPRESENTATION NIGHT OF A COUPLE

01:06:02.425 --> 01:06:05.995 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS YOU KIND OF HIT ON A

01:06:04.861 --> 01:06:07.230 region:rollup2
COUPLE THINGS THAT.

01:06:05.995 --> 01:06:09.232 region:rollup2
THAT I THINK ARE IMPORTANT YOU

01:06:07.230 --> 01:06:11.701 region:rollup2
MENTION EXIT OF INSURANCE SIR

01:06:09.232 --> 01:06:13.736 region:rollup2
INSURERS FROM THE MARKET --

01:06:11.701 --> 01:06:14.370 region:rollup2
AND ENDING HE SAID WE NEED I

01:06:13.736 --> 01:06:15.705 region:rollup2
THINK YOU SAID WE NEED TO FIGURE

01:06:14.370 --> 01:06:16.973 region:rollup2
OUT A WAY.

01:06:15.705 --> 01:06:18.308 region:rollup2
TO STEM THE TIDE OF THAT OR

01:06:16.973 --> 01:06:19.876 region:rollup2
MAYBE I MISSED THAT'S HOW I

01:06:18.308 --> 01:06:21.611 region:rollup2
INTERPRETED IT --

01:06:19.876 --> 01:06:24.714 region:rollup2
AND YOU TALK ABOUT BROADER

01:06:21.611 --> 01:06:25.715 region:rollup2
INSURANCE MARKET REFORMS --

01:06:24.714 --> 01:06:27.116 region:rollup2
DO YOU HAVE MORE THOUGHTS ON

01:06:25.715 --> 01:06:28.418 region:rollup2
THAT I MEAN.

01:06:27.116 --> 01:06:29.786 region:rollup2
THERE WERE A NUMBER OF BILLS

01:06:28.418 --> 01:06:31.321 region:rollup2
THAT CAME OUT OF THE FIRE THE

01:06:29.786 --> 01:06:32.655 region:rollup2
AFTERMATH OF THE FIRES.

01:06:31.321 --> 01:06:34.324 region:rollup2
AIMED AT SOME OF THESE THINGS

01:06:32.655 --> 01:06:36.125 region:rollup2
BUT I'LL BE HONEST YOU KNOW INS

01:06:34.324 --> 01:06:38.528 region:rollup2
IN SUMMER CASES I KNOW.

01:06:36.125 --> 01:06:39.829 region:rollup2
ABOUT 60% OF THE PEOPLE IN MY

01:06:38.528 --> 01:06:41.431 region:rollup2
DISTRICT WHO HAD LOSSES OR UNDER

01:06:39.829 --> 01:06:43.533 region:rollup2
INSURED.

01:06:41.431 --> 01:06:46.436 region:rollup2
AND IN MANY CASES INSURERS ARE

01:06:43.533 --> 01:06:48.071 region:rollup2
NOT WILLING TO WRITE UP POLICY

01:06:46.436 --> 01:06:50.640 region:rollup2
FOR THE FULL VALUE.

01:06:48.071 --> 01:06:51.241 region:rollup2
OF OF THE PROPERTY SO THEY WILL

01:06:50.640 --> 01:06:52.909 region:rollup2
BE CONTINUE TO BE CHRONICALLY

01:06:51.241 --> 01:06:54.143 region:rollup2
UNDER.

01:06:52.909 --> 01:06:56.212 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S A CHALLENGING EVEN

01:06:54.143 --> 01:06:58.915 region:rollup2
EFFORTS DO YOU ALLOW PEOPLE TO

01:06:56.212 --> 01:07:00.617 region:rollup2
BUY EXCESS COVERAGE --

01:06:58.915 --> 01:07:01.251 region:rollup2
BEYOND WHAT THEIR POLICY HAVE

01:07:00.617 --> 01:07:03.620 region:rollup2
BEEN MET WITH SOME RESISTANCE SO

01:07:01.251 --> 01:07:05.855 region:rollup2
--

01:07:03.620 --> 01:07:06.956 region:rollup2
YOU HAVE.

01:07:05.855 --> 01:07:08.491 region:rollup2
AS YOU AS WE START TALKING ABOUT

01:07:06.956 --> 01:07:09.926 region:rollup2
THIS.

01:07:08.491 --> 01:07:11.294 region:rollup2
AND AND THE SCOPE OF OF THE

01:07:09.926 --> 01:07:12.829 region:rollup2
ISSUES HERE IN THE POTENTIAL

01:07:11.294 --> 01:07:12.996 region:rollup2
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES I JUST

01:07:12.829 --> 01:07:16.399 region:rollup2
SEE.

01:07:12.996 --> 01:07:18.268 region:rollup2
I SEE [inaudible] TEN BILLS

01:07:16.399 --> 01:07:19.869 region:rollup2
COMING OUT OF OUT OF THIS

01:07:18.268 --> 01:07:21.304 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT A VARIETY OF SOBS

01:07:19.869 --> 01:07:22.872 region:rollup2
SUBJECTS BEYOND WHAT WE'RE

01:07:21.304 --> 01:07:25.808 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT HERE TODAY SO I WAS A

01:07:22.872 --> 01:07:26.643 region:rollup2
BROAD QUESTION BUT DO YOU.

01:07:25.808 --> 01:07:28.511 region:rollup2
YOU HAVE SOME THOUGHTS ON THAT

01:07:26.643 --> 01:07:29.145 region:rollup2
YOU COULD YOU MENTIONED YOU

01:07:28.511 --> 01:07:32.081 region:rollup2
MENTIONED PROP ONE OF THREE AND

01:07:29.145 --> 01:07:33.683 region:rollup2
THAT'S IF YOU HAVE A LOT OF

01:07:32.081 --> 01:07:34.751 region:rollup2
PEOPLE DISCOVERED I DON'T THINK

01:07:33.683 --> 01:07:36.252 region:rollup2
THAT PROP ONE OF THREE IS GOING

01:07:34.751 --> 01:07:37.387 region:rollup2
TO CHANGE ANYTIME SOON.

01:07:36.252 --> 01:07:38.855 region:rollup2
AND ANYTHING THAT HAPPENS ON THE

01:07:37.387 --> 01:07:40.857 region:rollup2
INSURANCE SIDE HAS TO BE

01:07:38.855 --> 01:07:41.424 region:rollup2
CONSISTENT FURTHER ITS PURPOSES.

01:07:40.857 --> 01:07:43.026 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S THAT'S THE JUDGE

01:07:41.424 --> 01:07:45.161 region:rollup2
MADE.

01:07:43.026 --> 01:07:46.930 region:rollup2
LAW ON THE ISSUE --

01:07:45.161 --> 01:07:49.032 region:rollup2
SO THE QUESTION IS HOW CAN WE

01:07:46.930 --> 01:07:50.733 region:rollup2
ACHIEVE.

01:07:49.032 --> 01:07:52.735 region:rollup2
INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR

01:07:50.733 --> 01:07:54.103 region:rollup2
HOMEOWNERS AT THE MOST

01:07:52.735 --> 01:07:55.305 region:rollup2
AFFORDABLE PRICE THAT REFLECTS

01:07:54.103 --> 01:07:57.640 region:rollup2
THE RISK THEY'RE TAKING RIGHT

01:07:55.305 --> 01:07:59.175 region:rollup2
AND RIGHT NOW WE HAVE A

01:07:57.640 --> 01:08:00.009 region:rollup2
SITUATION WHERE AT LEAST IN THE

01:07:59.175 --> 01:08:01.811 region:rollup2
VIEW OF THE MAJORITY OF THE

01:08:00.009 --> 01:08:03.012 region:rollup2
LARGE INSURERS.

01:08:01.811 --> 01:08:05.114 region:rollup2
THE PRICES THEY CAN CHARGE DO

01:08:03.012 --> 01:08:06.616 region:rollup2
NOT REFLECT AT RISK.

01:08:05.114 --> 01:08:07.784 region:rollup2
AND SO AND THAT'S PARTLY A

01:08:06.616 --> 01:08:09.252 region:rollup2
FUNCTION OF PROP ONE OF THREE

01:08:07.784 --> 01:08:10.486 region:rollup2
IT'S PARTLY FUNCTION OF RIGHT OF

01:08:09.252 --> 01:08:12.055 region:rollup2
DECISIONS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE BY

01:08:10.486 --> 01:08:14.157 region:rollup2
THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE.

01:08:12.055 --> 01:08:17.360 region:rollup2
IT'S IT'S A COMPLEX IT'S PARTLY

01:08:14.157 --> 01:08:18.561 region:rollup2
A FUNCTION OF PUSH BACK FROM

01:08:17.360 --> 01:08:19.629 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WHO RECENTLY YOU KNOW

01:08:18.561 --> 01:08:20.563 region:rollup2
DON'T ARE TRYING TO MINIMIZE

01:08:19.629 --> 01:08:21.331 region:rollup2
THEIR BILLS AND FOR THEIR

01:08:20.563 --> 01:08:23.099 region:rollup2
MORTGAGE.

01:08:21.331 --> 01:08:25.868 region:rollup2
AND THE LAST THING THEY NEED IS

01:08:23.099 --> 01:08:28.137 region:rollup2
A BIGGER INSURANCE BILL --

01:08:25.868 --> 01:08:30.573 region:rollup2
I THINK.

01:08:28.137 --> 01:08:32.408 region:rollup2
THERE A NUMBER OF ASPECTS OF THE

01:08:30.573 --> 01:08:34.143 region:rollup2
INSURANCE ON INSURANCE SIDE THAT

01:08:32.408 --> 01:08:35.812 region:rollup2
COULD BE CHANGED BUT THE

01:08:34.143 --> 01:08:37.180 region:rollup2
POLITICS OF INSURANCE ARE VERY

01:08:35.812 --> 01:08:38.381 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT THAN THE POLITICS OF

01:08:37.180 --> 01:08:39.849 region:rollup2
ENERGY WHICH IS WHAT I'M MOST

01:08:38.381 --> 01:08:41.117 region:rollup2
FAMILIAR WITH.

01:08:39.849 --> 01:08:42.385 region:rollup2
SO I'M I WANT TO BE A LITTLE BIT

01:08:41.117 --> 01:08:44.120 region:rollup2
HUMBLE HERE AND REFLECT THAT

01:08:42.385 --> 01:08:45.688 region:rollup2
REFLECT THAT KIND.

01:08:44.120 --> 01:08:48.491 region:rollup2
IGNORANCE --

01:08:45.688 --> 01:08:50.593 region:rollup2
BUT I THINK ONE OBVIOUS QUESTION

01:08:48.491 --> 01:08:52.895 region:rollup2
TO ASK IS.

01:08:50.593 --> 01:08:54.731 region:rollup2
WHY IT IS WHY IT IS THAT

01:08:52.895 --> 01:08:56.833 region:rollup2
INSURERS CANNOT REINSURER?

01:08:54.731 --> 01:08:57.166 region:rollup2
THEIR WILDFIRE RISK IN THE STATE

01:08:56.833 --> 01:09:00.470 region:rollup2
OF CALIFORNIA.

01:08:57.166 --> 01:09:02.839 region:rollup2
THAT IS A WELL USED TOOL FOR

01:09:00.470 --> 01:09:04.707 region:rollup2
MANAGING CATASTROPHIC RISK IN

01:09:02.839 --> 01:09:06.442 region:rollup2
OTHER STATES AND WE SHOULD BE

01:09:04.707 --> 01:09:07.076 region:rollup2
ASKING.

01:09:06.442 --> 01:09:08.211 region:rollup2
WHETHER THAT'S AN APPROPRIATE

01:09:07.076 --> 01:09:09.445 region:rollup2
STEP TO TAKE THAT WOULD HELP THE

01:09:08.211 --> 01:09:11.547 region:rollup2
INSURERS TO SPREAD OUT THEIR

01:09:09.445 --> 01:09:13.416 region:rollup2
RISK HELP THEM TO BE ABLE TO

01:09:11.547 --> 01:09:16.886 region:rollup2
ENSURE MORE.

01:09:13.416 --> 01:09:18.521 region:rollup2
OF THE RISK IN CALIFORNIA --

01:09:16.886 --> 01:09:19.122 region:rollup2
ANOTHER QUESTION TO BE ASKING IS

01:09:18.521 --> 01:09:21.591 region:rollup2
WHETHER WE WANT TO MOVE TOWARD

01:09:19.122 --> 01:09:23.026 region:rollup2
--

01:09:21.591 --> 01:09:24.694 region:rollup2
THE APPROACH THAT THE

01:09:23.026 --> 01:09:26.829 region:rollup2
SOUTHEASTERN U. S. IS TAKEN

01:09:24.694 --> 01:09:28.398 region:rollup2
WHERE THERE ARE SEPARATE STATE

01:09:26.829 --> 01:09:29.699 region:rollup2
RUN PROGRAMS THAT MANAGE A

01:09:28.398 --> 01:09:31.534 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR SLICE OF THE

01:09:29.699 --> 01:09:33.403 region:rollup2
HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE RISK.

01:09:31.534 --> 01:09:35.071 region:rollup2
THIS IS THE WIND INSURANCE AND

01:09:33.403 --> 01:09:37.006 region:rollup2
THE SOUTHEAST IT COULD WELL BE

01:09:35.071 --> 01:09:37.607 region:rollup2
THAT WE NEED TO DO THAT FOR WILD

01:09:37.006 --> 01:09:40.410 region:rollup2
FIRE INSURANCE IN CALIFORNIA.

01:09:37.607 --> 01:09:41.644 region:rollup2
I WOULD NOTS SING I WOULD NOT

01:09:40.410 --> 01:09:42.779 region:rollup2
SUGGEST THAT THE EARTHQUAKE

01:09:41.644 --> 01:09:43.413 region:rollup2
AUTHORITY IS THE RIGHT WAY TO DO

01:09:42.779 --> 01:09:45.281 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:09:43.413 --> 01:09:46.416 region:rollup2
I THINK THE LEARNING SINCE THAT

01:09:45.281 --> 01:09:48.618 region:rollup2
TIME IT'S BEEN DONE IN THE

01:09:46.416 --> 01:09:49.218 region:rollup2
SOUTHEAST ON WINS SUGGESTS A

01:09:48.618 --> 01:09:51.220 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT MODEL THAT IT'S MORE

01:09:49.218 --> 01:09:53.456 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVE --

01:09:51.220 --> 01:09:55.058 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THAT --

01:09:53.456 --> 01:09:56.359 region:rollup2
THERE HAS TO BE SOMEWAY IT'S WAS

01:09:55.058 --> 01:09:58.161 region:rollup2
INTERESTING SO PEOPLE WHO CAN'T

01:09:56.359 --> 01:09:58.728 region:rollup2
GET FIRE INSURANCE IN CALIFORNIA

01:09:58.161 --> 01:09:59.595 region:rollup2
KICKING HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE

01:09:58.728 --> 01:10:00.963 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF FIRE.

01:09:59.595 --> 01:10:01.431 region:rollup2
AND UP ON SOMETHING CALLED THE

01:10:00.963 --> 01:10:04.901 region:rollup2
FAIR PLAN [inaudible]

01:10:01.431 --> 01:10:06.569 region:rollup2
AND IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING FROM

01:10:04.901 --> 01:10:08.237 region:rollup2
TALKING TO INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE

01:10:06.569 --> 01:10:09.772 region:rollup2
ON THE FAIR PLAN.

01:10:08.237 --> 01:10:10.973 region:rollup2
THAT -- THEY

01:10:09.772 --> 01:10:13.276 region:rollup2
CAN BE CHARGED DIFFERENTIAL

01:10:10.973 --> 01:10:14.510 region:rollup2
RATES DEPENDING ON THEIR RISK

01:10:13.276 --> 01:10:15.611 region:rollup2
RATHER THEY HAVE DEFENSIBLE

01:10:14.510 --> 01:10:17.547 region:rollup2
SPACE OR NOT.

01:10:15.611 --> 01:10:19.215 region:rollup2
THOSE KINDS OF ISSUES.

01:10:17.547 --> 01:10:20.149 region:rollup2
THE SAME THING IS NOT

01:10:19.215 --> 01:10:21.851 region:rollup2
NECESSARILY THE CASE FOR THE

01:10:20.149 --> 01:10:23.419 region:rollup2
REGULATED LINES.

01:10:21.851 --> 01:10:25.288 region:rollup2
AND I DO THINK THAT WE NEED TO

01:10:23.419 --> 01:10:27.390 region:rollup2
START TO THINK ABOUT HOW TO

01:10:25.288 --> 01:10:28.691 region:rollup2
EDUCATE HOMEOWNERS ABOUT WHAT

01:10:27.390 --> 01:10:29.759 region:rollup2
THE RISKS ARE.

01:10:28.691 --> 01:10:30.893 region:rollup2
MOST PEOPLE WHERE I LIVE DON'T

01:10:29.759 --> 01:10:31.527 region:rollup2
HAVE DEFENSIBLE SPACE AND THEY

01:10:30.893 --> 01:10:32.195 region:rollup2
DON'T KNOW THAT THEY DON'T HAVE

01:10:31.527 --> 01:10:34.263 region:rollup2
IT.

01:10:32.195 --> 01:10:35.565 region:rollup2
NO ONE TELLS THEM.

01:10:34.263 --> 01:10:37.066 region:rollup2
NO ONE SAYS TO THEM YOU COULD

01:10:35.565 --> 01:10:39.068 region:rollup2
SAVE MONEY.

01:10:37.066 --> 01:10:40.436 region:rollup2
IF YOU CUT DOWN THAT TREE.

01:10:39.068 --> 01:10:41.504 region:rollup2
AND I THINK WE NEED TO MOVE IN

01:10:40.436 --> 01:10:43.473 region:rollup2
THAT DIRECTION IS A STATE THAT

01:10:41.504 --> 01:10:44.774 region:rollup2
MAY BE UNCOMFORTABLE FOR SOME

01:10:43.473 --> 01:10:46.375 region:rollup2
BECAUSE PEOPLE LIKE TRIP.

01:10:44.774 --> 01:10:48.044 region:rollup2
IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

01:10:46.375 --> 01:10:48.578 region:rollup2
BUT IT ALSO IS RISKY AND

01:10:48.044 --> 01:10:52.248 region:rollup2
INCREASINGLY RISKY AND THE

01:10:48.578 --> 01:10:54.617 region:rollup2
CLIMATE WE LIVE.

01:10:52.248 --> 01:10:55.985 region:rollup2
COM AND YOU TALKED INTO.

01:10:54.617 --> 01:10:57.353 region:rollup2
JUST ANOTHER YOU TALK ABOUT

01:10:55.985 --> 01:10:59.689 region:rollup2
PROTECTION ESPECIALLY IN THE

01:10:57.353 --> 01:11:01.657 region:rollup2
WILD AND URBAN INTERFACE AND AND

01:10:59.689 --> 01:11:02.291 region:rollup2
WE'RE NOT DOING AS MUCH OF THE

01:11:01.657 --> 01:11:03.426 region:rollup2
GOOD IN YOU AND YOU JUST HIT ON

01:11:02.291 --> 01:11:04.594 region:rollup2
THAT I THINK.

01:11:03.426 --> 01:11:05.728 region:rollup2
I THINK SOMETIMES HOMEOWNERS

01:11:04.594 --> 01:11:07.263 region:rollup2
DON'T KNOW THAT THE TREES ARE

01:11:05.728 --> 01:11:08.965 region:rollup2
RISK AND THEN THERE I KNOW THERE

01:11:07.263 --> 01:11:09.999 region:rollup2
ARE SITUATIONS WHERE HOMEOWNERS.

01:11:08.965 --> 01:11:11.033 region:rollup2
MAY KNOW THERE'S A TO TREAT

01:11:09.999 --> 01:11:12.301 region:rollup2
SERVICE THEY DON'T WANT THEM CUT

01:11:11.033 --> 01:11:15.104 region:rollup2
DOWN BECAUSE FOR FOR OTHER

01:11:12.301 --> 01:11:16.172 region:rollup2
REASONS -- I

01:11:15.104 --> 01:11:18.541 region:rollup2
THINK THAT THAT AND THAT

01:11:16.172 --> 01:11:19.642 region:rollup2
CONTINUES TO JUST THE FUEL LOADS

01:11:18.541 --> 01:11:21.210 region:rollup2
IN THOSE AREAS CONTINUE TO BE A

01:11:19.642 --> 01:11:22.578 region:rollup2
PROBLEM.

01:11:21.210 --> 01:11:24.013 region:rollup2
AND WE KNOW WE'RE STARTING TO NO

01:11:22.578 --> 01:11:25.548 region:rollup2
OTHER WERE WAITING FOR SOME

01:11:24.013 --> 01:11:27.450 region:rollup2
ACTUAL MEASUREMENTS ON THIS THAT

01:11:25.548 --> 01:11:29.418 region:rollup2
WHEN YOU HAVE THESE HUGE FIRES

01:11:27.450 --> 01:11:30.153 region:rollup2
ALL THOSE GREENHOUSE GAS.

01:11:29.418 --> 01:11:31.320 region:rollup2
EFFORTS THAT WE'VE DONE FOR

01:11:30.153 --> 01:11:33.689 region:rollup2
REDUCTION --

01:11:31.320 --> 01:11:36.259 region:rollup2
GO OUT THE WINDOW BY HUGE

01:11:33.689 --> 01:11:37.860 region:rollup2
FACTORS AND THAT AIR QUALITY IS

01:11:36.259 --> 01:11:39.362 region:rollup2
PRETTY AWFUL BUT QUITE FRANKLY

01:11:37.860 --> 01:11:40.496 region:rollup2
AFTER HAVING LIVED THROUGH THAT.

01:11:39.362 --> 01:11:41.931 region:rollup2
THE DAY AFTER OUT THE TUBS FIRE

01:11:40.496 --> 01:11:43.032 region:rollup2
INBREEDING THAT FOR THREE OR

01:11:41.931 --> 01:11:45.234 region:rollup2
FOUR WEEKS --

01:11:43.032 --> 01:11:46.302 region:rollup2
SO.

01:11:45.234 --> 01:11:47.904 region:rollup2
IT YOU KNOW.

01:11:46.302 --> 01:11:48.971 region:rollup2
YOU HAVE ANY THOUGHTS ON IT

01:11:47.904 --> 01:11:50.239 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT IS DIFFICULT TO GET

01:11:48.971 --> 01:11:52.475 region:rollup2
GRANDSON MEAN CERTAINLY IN MY

01:11:50.239 --> 01:11:53.543 region:rollup2
NECK OF THE WOODS WE CAN'T GET

01:11:52.475 --> 01:11:54.710 region:rollup2
GRANTS --

01:11:53.543 --> 01:11:56.145 region:rollup2
FOR SOME OF THESE ACTIVITIES

01:11:54.710 --> 01:11:57.880 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF THE WAY THINGS ARE

01:11:56.145 --> 01:11:58.414 region:rollup2
SCORED --

01:11:57.880 --> 01:12:00.049 region:rollup2
THROUGH --

01:11:58.414 --> 01:12:00.583 region:rollup2
THROUGH ITS WE CAN'T GET ACCESS

01:12:00.049 --> 01:12:02.718 region:rollup2
TO SOME OF THE FUNNY TO DO

01:12:00.583 --> 01:12:04.353 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THE DO YOU HAVE

01:12:02.718 --> 01:12:05.688 region:rollup2
THOUGHTS ON ON HOW THAT MIGHT

01:12:04.353 --> 01:12:05.955 region:rollup2
HAVE THAT MIGHT PLAY OUT GOING

01:12:05.688 --> 01:12:07.924 region:rollup2
FORWARD.

01:12:05.955 --> 01:12:09.592 region:rollup2
WELL I MEAN I SEE JUSTIN MY

01:12:07.924 --> 01:12:10.760 region:rollup2
SLIDES THAT I THINK THAT WE NEED

01:12:09.592 --> 01:12:12.795 region:rollup2
TO DRAMATICALLY INCREASE THE

01:12:10.760 --> 01:12:14.330 region:rollup2
LEVEL OF THE FUEL REDUCTION

01:12:12.795 --> 01:12:15.598 region:rollup2
GRANTS IN THE STATE AND THAT

01:12:14.330 --> 01:12:16.899 region:rollup2
THAT IS AN EXTREMELY COST

01:12:15.598 --> 01:12:19.268 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVE ACTION.

01:12:16.899 --> 01:12:20.603 region:rollup2
IN MY VIEW THOSE GRANTS ANY

01:12:19.268 --> 01:12:23.539 region:rollup2
INCREASE IN FUNDING SHOULD BE

01:12:20.603 --> 01:12:25.641 region:rollup2
FOCUSED ON WHERE PEOPLE LIVE.

01:12:23.539 --> 01:12:27.710 region:rollup2
RIGHT DIRECTLY ON RISK REDUCTION

01:12:25.641 --> 01:12:29.645 region:rollup2
KEEPING PEOPLE SAFE.

01:12:27.710 --> 01:12:31.480 region:rollup2
THAT COULD BE A COST SHARE WITH

01:12:29.645 --> 01:12:32.114 region:rollup2
AN INDIVIDUAL PROPERTY OWNER

01:12:31.480 --> 01:12:33.616 region:rollup2
WHERE THEY HAVE A TREE THAT'S AT

01:12:32.114 --> 01:12:34.350 region:rollup2
RISK.

01:12:33.616 --> 01:12:35.551 region:rollup2
RIGHT IT'S BUDGET THAT CREATES

01:12:34.350 --> 01:12:36.919 region:rollup2
RISKY BUT IT'S IT'S IT'S GONNA

01:12:35.551 --> 01:12:37.787 region:rollup2
COST TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS TO CUT

01:12:36.919 --> 01:12:39.088 region:rollup2
DOWN.

01:12:37.787 --> 01:12:40.456 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THAT THAT MAY BE A COST

01:12:39.088 --> 01:12:41.591 region:rollup2
SHARE FOR THE COMMUNITY.

01:12:40.456 --> 01:12:44.193 region:rollup2
IT COULD BE FULLY FUNDING

01:12:41.591 --> 01:12:45.695 region:rollup2
POSITIONS FOR PEOPLE TO GO OUT

01:12:44.193 --> 01:12:46.762 region:rollup2
INTO THE COMMUNITY --

01:12:45.695 --> 01:12:47.663 region:rollup2
ON THE IN THE LOCAL FIRE

01:12:46.762 --> 01:12:49.599 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENTS AND EDUCATE

01:12:47.663 --> 01:12:51.467 region:rollup2
HOMEOWNERS ABOUT WHAT HOW

01:12:49.599 --> 01:12:52.401 region:rollup2
THEY'RE CREATING RISKS.

01:12:51.467 --> 01:12:55.137 region:rollup2
NOT JUST FOR THEMSELVES BUT FOR

01:12:52.401 --> 01:12:57.573 region:rollup2
THEIR NEIGHBORS --

01:12:55.137 --> 01:12:59.308 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THE YOU KNOW THAT

01:12:57.573 --> 01:13:00.243 region:rollup2
THE LAST IN AND HARDER QUESTION

01:12:59.308 --> 01:13:01.544 region:rollup2
IS IS THIS ISSUE AROUND YOU

01:13:00.243 --> 01:13:04.013 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENT.

01:13:01.544 --> 01:13:06.249 region:rollup2
AND AND AND THE FOOTPRINT OF NEW

01:13:04.013 --> 01:13:07.950 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENT IN THE VERY HIGH

01:13:06.249 --> 01:13:10.987 region:rollup2
HAZARD AREAS.

01:13:07.950 --> 01:13:14.156 region:rollup2
AND THAT IS OBVIOUSLY THORNY

01:13:10.987 --> 01:13:16.459 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENT LAND USE IS A LOCAL.

01:13:14.156 --> 01:13:16.792 region:rollup2
ISSUE ALONE AND ISSUE A REALLY

01:13:16.459 --> 01:13:18.494 region:rollup2
LOCAL CONTROL.

01:13:16.792 --> 01:13:19.996 region:rollup2
BY.

01:13:18.494 --> 01:13:21.130 region:rollup2
WE'RE CREATING THAT LOCAL

01:13:19.996 --> 01:13:22.298 region:rollup2
DECISION MAKING IS CREATING

01:13:21.130 --> 01:13:23.1000 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT EXTERNALITIES FOR

01:13:22.298 --> 01:13:24.567 region:rollup2
THE STATE.

01:13:23.1000 --> 01:13:27.236 region:rollup2
IN TERMS OF THE ELECTRICITY

01:13:24.567 --> 01:13:29.272 region:rollup2
SYSTEM AND ALSO TAXPAYERS AND SO

01:13:27.236 --> 01:13:30.940 region:rollup2
AT SOME POINT.

01:13:29.272 --> 01:13:34.443 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS NEED TO BE ASKED IN MY

01:13:30.940 --> 01:13:37.880 region:rollup2
VIEW.

01:13:34.443 --> 01:13:39.382 region:rollup2
THANK YOU A CENTER CANNELLA.

01:13:37.880 --> 01:13:41.150 region:rollup2
FIGURES CHAIRMAN SO IN YOUR

01:13:39.382 --> 01:13:41.784 region:rollup2
SLIDES I WANT TO THANK YOU

01:13:41.150 --> 01:13:43.586 region:rollup2
MENTION IS VEGETATION MANAGEMENT

01:13:41.784 --> 01:13:44.854 region:rollup2
--

01:13:43.586 --> 01:13:46.222 region:rollup2
WHERE PEOPLE LIVE YOU SAID WE

01:13:44.854 --> 01:13:47.556 region:rollup2
CAN EXPAND IT FOR THE PURPOSE OF

01:13:46.222 --> 01:13:48.858 region:rollup2
MY QUESTION?

01:13:47.556 --> 01:13:49.926 region:rollup2
OTHER THAN COSTS WERE SO THE

01:13:48.858 --> 01:13:53.863 region:rollup2
IMPEDIMENTS TO VEGETATION

01:13:49.926 --> 01:13:56.132 region:rollup2
MANAGEMENT [inaudible]

01:13:53.863 --> 01:13:57.199 region:rollup2
SEE -- ALL

01:13:56.132 --> 01:13:59.835 region:rollup2
THE ALSO TO THAT I THINK ARE

01:13:57.199 --> 01:14:01.137 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT. ONE IS THAT IN MANY

01:13:59.835 --> 01:14:02.605 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES --

01:14:01.137 --> 01:14:04.707 region:rollup2
YOU ACTUALLY NEED A PERMIT TO

01:14:02.605 --> 01:14:05.975 region:rollup2
CUT DOWN TREES THAT ARE BIG.

01:14:04.707 --> 01:14:07.276 region:rollup2
FROM WHOM FROM THE LOCAL

01:14:05.975 --> 01:14:08.544 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT CODE YOU NEED

01:14:07.276 --> 01:14:10.913 region:rollup2
HERITAGE TREE PERMITS I THINK

01:14:08.544 --> 01:14:12.882 region:rollup2
THAT THE STATE.

01:14:10.913 --> 01:14:14.984 region:rollup2
SHOULD LOOK AT THAT ISSUE AND

01:14:12.882 --> 01:14:16.786 region:rollup2
CONSIDER WHETHER --

01:14:14.984 --> 01:14:19.221 region:rollup2
IF A HERITAGE TREE IS LOCATED

01:14:16.786 --> 01:14:21.023 region:rollup2
WITHIN THE ZONE ONE AS CAL FIRE

01:14:19.221 --> 01:14:22.792 region:rollup2
I THINK LIKES TO CALL IT RIGHT

01:14:21.023 --> 01:14:24.260 region:rollup2
THAT FIRST THIRTY FEET. FOUR

01:14:22.792 --> 01:14:25.995 region:rollup2
HUNDRED FEET WEATHER PERMITS

01:14:24.260 --> 01:14:27.563 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE REQUIRED IF HOMEOWNER

01:14:25.995 --> 01:14:28.097 region:rollup2
ONE THIRTY FEET OR HER FEET FROM

01:14:27.563 --> 01:14:29.966 region:rollup2
THEIR HOUSE STRUCTURE THAT

01:14:28.097 --> 01:14:32.468 region:rollup2
YASSER --

01:14:29.966 --> 01:14:33.336 region:rollup2
AND THE YOU KNOW ANOTHER ANOTHER

01:14:32.468 --> 01:14:34.103 region:rollup2
BEER IN THIS IS A LITTLE BIT

01:14:33.336 --> 01:14:35.338 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT --

01:14:34.103 --> 01:14:37.006 region:rollup2
BUTI THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT

01:14:35.338 --> 01:14:38.774 region:rollup2
ONE TO BE THINKING ABOUT.

01:14:37.006 --> 01:14:41.277 region:rollup2
IS THE ISSUE OF UTILITY.

01:14:38.774 --> 01:14:43.012 region:rollup2
TREE TRIMMING AND ARBORISTS IN

01:14:41.277 --> 01:14:45.715 region:rollup2
IS DENSELY POPULATED AREAS WITH

01:14:43.012 --> 01:14:47.850 region:rollup2
LOTS OF SMALL PARCELS CURRENTLY.

01:14:45.715 --> 01:14:50.453 region:rollup2
DE UTILITY CODE THE SAFETY CODE

01:14:47.850 --> 01:14:51.721 region:rollup2
SAYS THAT UTILITIES RESPONSIBLE

01:14:50.453 --> 01:14:54.023 region:rollup2
FOR CUTTING DOWN DEAD DYING

01:14:51.721 --> 01:14:55.091 region:rollup2
EXECUTIVE TREES OUTSIDE OF THE

01:14:54.023 --> 01:14:56.592 region:rollup2
UTILITY EASEMENT.

01:14:55.091 --> 01:14:58.561 region:rollup2
RIGHT IF THEY COULD FALL INTO

01:14:56.592 --> 01:14:59.795 region:rollup2
THE LINES THAT'S WHAT HAS CAUSED

01:14:58.561 --> 01:15:01.330 region:rollup2
ALL THE FIRES FOR WHICH WE HAVE

01:14:59.795 --> 01:15:02.431 region:rollup2
BY REPORTS SO FAR THIS FROM THE

01:15:01.330 --> 01:15:04.066 region:rollup2
PAST YEAR.

01:15:02.431 --> 01:15:06.268 region:rollup2
TREES OUTSIDE OF THAT TEN FOOT

01:15:04.066 --> 01:15:07.603 region:rollup2
ZONE THAT'S CLEAR GETTING BLOWN

01:15:06.268 --> 01:15:09.271 region:rollup2
INTO THE ZONE AND KNOCKING DOWN

01:15:07.603 --> 01:15:10.373 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE CAN YOU EXPLAIN A

01:15:09.271 --> 01:15:11.574 region:rollup2
LITTLE BIT SO.

01:15:10.373 --> 01:15:12.875 region:rollup2
THAT YOU'RE SAYING TREATING

01:15:11.574 --> 01:15:15.144 region:rollup2
HOUSES OR TREES THING Y. TREE

01:15:12.875 --> 01:15:16.212 region:rollup2
SITTING TREATING LINES OKAY SO

01:15:15.144 --> 01:15:17.980 region:rollup2
CAN YOU EXPLAIN THAT THAT

01:15:16.212 --> 01:15:20.016 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENT AND TEN FEET FROM SO

01:15:17.980 --> 01:15:21.283 region:rollup2
HOW FAR TO THE TREES OF BE

01:15:20.016 --> 01:15:21.784 region:rollup2
CLEARED FROM THE ACTUAL LINES.

01:15:21.283 --> 01:15:23.786 region:rollup2
THERE HAS TO BE TEN CLIP

01:15:21.784 --> 01:15:26.155 region:rollup2
CLEARANCE.

01:15:23.786 --> 01:15:27.023 region:rollup2
BEYOND AND PARDON ME I'M SURE

01:15:26.155 --> 01:15:28.557 region:rollup2
THERE ARE A LOT OF EXPERTS

01:15:27.023 --> 01:15:29.625 region:rollup2
SITTING BEHIND ME WHO KNOW THIS

01:15:28.557 --> 01:15:31.060 region:rollup2
MUCH BETTER THAN I DO UNLESS

01:15:29.625 --> 01:15:32.528 region:rollup2
THEM AS WELL BUT TEN FOOT

01:15:31.060 --> 01:15:33.863 region:rollup2
CLEARANCE AND THEN IT'S THE

01:15:32.528 --> 01:15:35.264 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBILITY ARBORIST. TO

01:15:33.863 --> 01:15:37.767 region:rollup2
CLEAR ANYTHING OUTSIDE OF THAT

01:15:35.264 --> 01:15:39.101 region:rollup2
EASEMENT THAT MIGHT FALL INTO

01:15:37.767 --> 01:15:40.603 region:rollup2
THE EASEMENT AND CAUSE A FIRE

01:15:39.101 --> 01:15:41.904 region:rollup2
THE CHALLENGES.

01:15:40.603 --> 01:15:43.472 region:rollup2
IN PLACES WITH THOUSANDS OF

01:15:41.904 --> 01:15:44.807 region:rollup2
LANDOWNERS YOU GOT TRESPASS

01:15:43.472 --> 01:15:47.810 region:rollup2
ISSUE.

01:15:44.807 --> 01:15:50.146 region:rollup2
AND MY QUESTION IS HOW CAN NOT

01:15:47.810 --> 01:15:51.647 region:rollup2
HOW CAN WE SERVE RESOLVE THAT

01:15:50.146 --> 01:15:53.149 region:rollup2
TRESPASS PROBLEM.

01:15:51.647 --> 01:15:55.584 region:rollup2
MAKE IT EASIER FOR THE ARBORIST

01:15:53.149 --> 01:15:57.887 region:rollup2
GOING TO SOMEONE'S BACKYARD IN

01:15:55.584 --> 01:15:58.521 region:rollup2
SAUSALITO AND CUT DOWN A TREE

01:15:57.887 --> 01:16:01.524 region:rollup2
THAT'S A RISK IT'S DEAD OR DYING

01:15:58.521 --> 01:16:02.925 region:rollup2
--

01:16:01.524 --> 01:16:04.760 region:rollup2
WITH DOUBTS --

01:16:02.925 --> 01:16:06.796 region:rollup2
AND AND AND MAKING OUT EASIER

01:16:04.760 --> 01:16:08.364 region:rollup2
THIS BOTH GOING TO REDUCE RISK

01:16:06.796 --> 01:16:09.665 region:rollup2
AND ALSO CREATE ACCOUNTABILITY

01:16:08.364 --> 01:16:11.534 region:rollup2
GREATER CAO BECAUSE THE CODE

01:16:09.665 --> 01:16:13.102 region:rollup2
ALSO EXEMPTS THE UTILITIES IF

01:16:11.534 --> 01:16:14.770 region:rollup2
THEY HAVE TO TRESPASS. TO GET A

01:16:13.102 --> 01:16:16.105 region:rollup2
TREE SO HOW DID YOU SEE THAT THE

01:16:14.770 --> 01:16:17.840 region:rollup2
FIRES WERE CARS BECAUSE LARGELY

01:16:16.105 --> 01:16:19.508 region:rollup2
BY.

01:16:17.840 --> 01:16:21.043 region:rollup2
TREES ON PRIVATE PROPERTY THAT

01:16:19.508 --> 01:16:23.546 region:rollup2
FILLED THESE LINES ARE WITH

01:16:21.043 --> 01:16:24.079 region:rollup2
THESE OUT YOU KNOW I CAN'T I

01:16:23.546 --> 01:16:25.481 region:rollup2
CAN'T LOOK AT IT I THOUGHT

01:16:24.079 --> 01:16:26.082 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHAT YOU SAID SO THERE

01:16:25.481 --> 01:16:27.116 region:rollup2
ARE SAID CENTER WE'RE GONNA BE

01:16:26.082 --> 01:16:28.250 region:rollup2
HAVE.

01:16:27.116 --> 01:16:28.984 region:rollup2
I UNDERSTAND BUT THAT'S THAT'S

01:16:28.250 --> 01:16:30.319 region:rollup2
WHAT TO CLARIFY WHAT HE SETS

01:16:28.984 --> 01:16:33.355 region:rollup2
OKAY I CAN'T.

01:16:30.319 --> 01:16:35.357 region:rollup2
OKAY THANK YOU [inaudible]

01:16:33.355 --> 01:16:35.658 region:rollup2
ASSEMBLYMEMBER REYES

01:16:35.357 --> 01:16:38.761 region:rollup2
[inaudible]

01:16:35.658 --> 01:16:40.129 region:rollup2
THANK YOU.

01:16:38.761 --> 01:16:41.730 region:rollup2
WHEN YOU NEED NOTED YOUR

01:16:40.129 --> 01:16:44.166 region:rollup2
SOLUTIONS THE FIRST SLIDE ON

01:16:41.730 --> 01:16:46.202 region:rollup2
SOLUTIONS HAVE TO DO WITH

01:16:44.166 --> 01:16:47.670 region:rollup2
INVERSE CONDEMNATION?

01:16:46.202 --> 01:16:50.606 region:rollup2
AND DO YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS

01:16:47.670 --> 01:16:52.074 region:rollup2
CONSTITUTIONAL ACTION.

01:16:50.606 --> 01:16:53.409 region:rollup2
THAT A BIG PROBLEM WILL WORD

01:16:52.074 --> 01:16:54.810 region:rollup2
TRYING TO DEAL WITH THE INVERSE

01:16:53.409 --> 01:16:56.045 region:rollup2
CONDEMNATION.

01:16:54.810 --> 01:16:57.713 region:rollup2
A WHAT SPECIFICALLY DID YOU MEAN

01:16:56.045 --> 01:16:59.915 region:rollup2
BY.

01:16:57.713 --> 01:17:01.083 region:rollup2
CONSTITUTIONAL ACTION IN WHAT

01:16:59.915 --> 01:17:03.085 region:rollup2
I'M SORRY THAT WAS --

01:17:01.083 --> 01:17:04.587 region:rollup2
UNCLEAR --

01:17:03.085 --> 01:17:06.589 region:rollup2
WHAT I MEANT BY THAT IS THAT IT

01:17:04.587 --> 01:17:08.824 region:rollup2
WOULD BE CONSTITUTIONAL? FOR THE

01:17:06.589 --> 01:17:10.559 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE TO PASS A LAW WHICH

01:17:08.824 --> 01:17:12.094 region:rollup2
CLARIFIES --

01:17:10.559 --> 01:17:12.761 region:rollup2
CLARIFIES --

01:17:12.094 --> 01:17:14.997 region:rollup2
THE MEANING OF INVERSE

01:17:12.761 --> 01:17:17.666 region:rollup2
CONDEMNATION --

01:17:14.997 --> 01:17:20.236 region:rollup2
AND THAT THAT ACTION IN MY VIEW.

01:17:17.666 --> 01:17:21.670 region:rollup2
WOULD BE UPHELD NOT REALLY IF

01:17:20.236 --> 01:17:23.606 region:rollup2
BUT WHEN IT WAS JUDICIALLY

01:17:21.670 --> 01:17:25.040 region:rollup2
CHALLENGED BY THE COURTS AND THE

01:17:23.606 --> 01:17:26.809 region:rollup2
KEY CASES THERE.

01:17:25.040 --> 01:17:28.911 region:rollup2
THERE'S A CASE CALLED --

01:17:26.809 --> 01:17:30.212 region:rollup2
METHODIST HOSPITAL OF SACRAMENTO

01:17:28.911 --> 01:17:33.582 region:rollup2
VERSUS SAILOR.

01:17:30.212 --> 01:17:35.451 region:rollup2
WHICH IS KIND OF THE THE THAT

01:17:33.582 --> 01:17:38.621 region:rollup2
DID MOST KEY CASON THAT DID LOOK

01:17:35.451 --> 01:17:40.489 region:rollup2
WITH THE SUPREME COURT LOOKED AT

01:17:38.621 --> 01:17:43.859 region:rollup2
ISSUE OF CLARIFICATIONS

01:17:40.489 --> 01:17:44.960 region:rollup2
INTERPRETATIONS OF AMBIGUOUS

IN THE CONSTITUTION AND THE

01:17:45.928 --> 01:17:48.831 region:rollup2
LEVEL OF DEFERENCE THE COURTS

01:17:47.496 --> 01:17:50.232 region:rollup2
WILL GIVE TO LEGISLATIVE

01:17:48.831 --> 01:17:52.168 region:rollup2
INTERPRETATION OF AMBIGUOUS

01:17:50.232 --> 01:17:53.936 region:rollup2
PROVISIONS AND THE COURT SAID IT

01:17:52.168 --> 01:17:55.304 region:rollup2
IS NOT JUST THAT THEY THEY IN

01:17:53.936 --> 01:17:56.505 region:rollup2
GENERAL WILL DIFFER IN THE

01:17:55.304 --> 01:17:57.706 region:rollup2
SUPREME COURT'S YOU IT'S THEIR

01:17:56.505 --> 01:18:00.776 region:rollup2
DUTY TO DIFFER.

01:17:57.706 --> 01:18:02.444 region:rollup2
UNLESS THE PROVISION IS CLEAR --

01:18:00.776 --> 01:18:04.880 region:rollup2
AND AND IT LEGISLATURE IS TAKING

01:18:02.444 --> 01:18:05.681 region:rollup2
ACTION THAT'S CLEARLY --

01:18:04.880 --> 01:18:08.417 region:rollup2
CONTRADICTORY TO THE

01:18:05.681 --> 01:18:10.719 region:rollup2
CONSTITUTION NOW GIVEN THE CASE

01:18:08.417 --> 01:18:12.521 region:rollup2
LAW ON INVERSE CONDEMNATION

01:18:10.719 --> 01:18:15.958 region:rollup2
EARLY CASES ALBERS.

01:18:12.521 --> 01:18:18.260 region:rollup2
AND THE FLOOD INSURANCE CASES --

01:18:15.958 --> 01:18:19.495 region:rollup2
LACHLAN AND ITS PROGENY --

01:18:18.260 --> 01:18:21.363 region:rollup2
I THINK THERE'S A CASE TO BE

01:18:19.495 --> 01:18:22.965 region:rollup2
MADE A VERY GOOD CASE THAT A

01:18:21.363 --> 01:18:24.533 region:rollup2
NARROWLY TAILORED INVERSE

01:18:22.965 --> 01:18:26.168 region:rollup2
CONDEMNATION REFORM.

01:18:24.533 --> 01:18:27.503 region:rollup2
IS CONSTITUTIONAL WOULD WOULD

01:18:26.168 --> 01:18:29.538 region:rollup2
PASSED JUDICIAL MONSTER AND

01:18:27.503 --> 01:18:31.540 region:rollup2
JUDICIAL REVIEW --

01:18:29.538 --> 01:18:33.976 region:rollup2
ABROAD EXEMPTION.

01:18:31.540 --> 01:18:36.178 region:rollup2
IS A DIFFERENT STORY ALTOGETHER.

01:18:33.976 --> 01:18:37.112 region:rollup2
RIGHT BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT.

01:18:36.178 --> 01:18:37.880 region:rollup2
FLOOD CASES OR THE GOVERNOR'S

01:18:37.112 --> 01:18:41.417 region:rollup2
PROPOSAL [inaudible]

01:18:37.880 --> 01:18:42.418 region:rollup2
ARE THEY'RE RELATIVELY NARROW.

01:18:41.417 --> 01:18:45.854 region:rollup2
LIMITED TO A CERTAIN SET OF

01:18:42.418 --> 01:18:47.590 region:rollup2
CIRCUMSTANCES AND I THINK --

01:18:45.854 --> 01:18:49.825 region:rollup2
A BILL THAT.

01:18:47.590 --> 01:18:52.127 region:rollup2
LOOKS AT THAT ISSUE AND AND

01:18:49.825 --> 01:18:53.662 region:rollup2
EVALUATES THE FACTORS AND THERE

01:18:52.127 --> 01:18:57.166 region:rollup2
CAP APPLIES THEM TO THE FACTS WE

01:18:53.662 --> 01:18:58.801 region:rollup2
CONFRONT NOW --

01:18:57.166 --> 01:18:59.702 region:rollup2
HAS THAT HAS A VERY GOOD CHANCE

01:18:58.801 --> 01:19:01.403 region:rollup2
I'M OUT I WANT TO SAY IT'S A

01:18:59.702 --> 01:19:02.738 region:rollup2
CERTAINTY BECAUSE NOTHING IS

01:19:01.403 --> 01:19:04.840 region:rollup2
CERTAIN WHEN YOU.

01:19:02.738 --> 01:19:07.509 region:rollup2
GOT BEEN IN LITIGATION --

01:19:04.840 --> 01:19:08.777 region:rollup2
GOT TO SUPREME COURT BUT I THINK

01:19:07.509 --> 01:19:14.516 region:rollup2
IT HAS A VERY GOOD CHANCE OF

01:19:08.777 --> 01:19:15.551 region:rollup2
SURVIVING YOU SHORTLY.

01:19:14.516 --> 01:19:16.819 region:rollup2
TIM A MEMBER WOULD.

01:19:15.551 --> 01:19:18.487 region:rollup2
THINK THANK YOU MISTER I JUST A

01:19:16.819 --> 01:19:21.991 region:rollup2
QUICK FOLLOW UP AND THAT WAS IT

01:19:18.487 --> 01:19:23.892 region:rollup2
CO JOG MY THOUGHT PROCESS HERE.

01:19:21.991 --> 01:19:25.928 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW YOU TALKED ABOUT --

01:19:23.892 --> 01:19:27.696 region:rollup2
ART WHAT YOU TALKED ABOUT HOW WE

01:19:25.928 --> 01:19:29.632 region:rollup2
COULD DO SOME OF THAT ADDITIONAL

01:19:27.696 --> 01:19:31.634 region:rollup2
GRANTS FOR FOR AWHILE AND ENTER

01:19:29.632 --> 01:19:34.403 region:rollup2
THE URBAN INTERFACE --

01:19:31.634 --> 01:19:35.704 region:rollup2
AREAS AND IN MAKING AREA SAY ARE

01:19:34.403 --> 01:19:37.239 region:rollup2
THERE EXAMPLES WERE OTHER

01:19:35.704 --> 01:19:38.874 region:rollup2
JURISDICTION YOU TO AND YOU TALK

01:19:37.239 --> 01:19:40.275 region:rollup2
BUT CARROTS AND STICKS SO THERE

01:19:38.874 --> 01:19:42.378 region:rollup2
ANY EXAMPLES OUT THERE WHERE

01:19:40.275 --> 01:19:43.012 region:rollup2
THEY HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL.

01:19:42.378 --> 01:19:44.246 region:rollup2
IN THESE KINDS OF PROGRAMS THAT

01:19:43.012 --> 01:19:45.247 region:rollup2
WE COULD.

01:19:44.246 --> 01:19:46.782 region:rollup2
RATHER THAN REINVENTING THE

01:19:45.247 --> 01:19:48.751 region:rollup2
WHEEL --

01:19:46.782 --> 01:19:50.185 region:rollup2
FIGURE OUT HOW.

01:19:48.751 --> 01:19:50.986 region:rollup2
BEACON.

01:19:50.185 --> 01:19:52.288 region:rollup2
IT'S I AGREE I I SEE WHERE

01:19:50.986 --> 01:19:53.889 region:rollup2
YOU'RE GOING BUT ARE THERE IS

01:19:52.288 --> 01:19:54.823 region:rollup2
THERE SOMETHING OUT THERE THAT

01:19:53.889 --> 01:19:55.658 region:rollup2
HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL THAT WE

01:19:54.823 --> 01:19:57.660 region:rollup2
MIGHT BE ABLE.

01:19:55.658 --> 01:19:58.994 region:rollup2
TO TELL I THINK YOU KNOW I I

01:19:57.660 --> 01:20:00.496 region:rollup2
DON'T MEAN TO BEAT A DEAD HORSE

01:19:58.994 --> 01:20:02.164 region:rollup2
IN THIS ONE BUT THAT THE WINDS

01:20:00.496 --> 01:20:03.632 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS AND SOUTHEAST ARE GREAT

01:20:02.164 --> 01:20:05.501 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE OF THIS WHERE.

01:20:03.632 --> 01:20:07.469 region:rollup2
THE KNOW THAT THE REFORMS THE

01:20:05.501 --> 01:20:09.305 region:rollup2
INSURANCE REFORMS WERE PAIRED

01:20:07.469 --> 01:20:09.905 region:rollup2
WITH BUILDING CODE AND LAND USE

01:20:09.305 --> 01:20:10.939 region:rollup2
REFORM.

01:20:09.905 --> 01:20:12.341 region:rollup2
THAT WAS AN ESSENTIAL PART OF

01:20:10.939 --> 01:20:14.710 region:rollup2
THE EQUATION.

01:20:12.341 --> 01:20:16.278 region:rollup2
AND THE INSURANCE REFORMS CREATE

01:20:14.710 --> 01:20:19.081 region:rollup2
STRONG INCENTIVES FINANCIAL

01:20:16.278 --> 01:20:20.983 region:rollup2
INCENTIVES TO TAKE LESS RISK AND

01:20:19.081 --> 01:20:23.052 region:rollup2
A BUILDING CODES AND THE LAND

01:20:20.983 --> 01:20:24.987 region:rollup2
USE REFORMS HELP --

01:20:23.052 --> 01:20:26.355 region:rollup2
TO AVOID THE CREATION OF NEW.

01:20:24.987 --> 01:20:29.725 region:rollup2
VALUE AT RISK [inaudible]

01:20:26.355 --> 01:20:31.994 region:rollup2
AND SO --

01:20:29.725 --> 01:20:32.728 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW IT'S THAT COMBINATION.

01:20:31.994 --> 01:20:33.562 region:rollup2
THAT ACTION THAT'S GONNA BE

01:20:32.728 --> 01:20:34.797 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT.

01:20:33.562 --> 01:20:35.764 region:rollup2
THAT CHALLENGE IT CALIFORNIA

01:20:34.797 --> 01:20:38.333 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF OUR REAL ESTATE

01:20:35.764 --> 01:20:40.035 region:rollup2
MARKET WE HAVE FAR MORE VALUE AT

01:20:38.333 --> 01:20:40.703 region:rollup2
RISK DUE TO WILDFIRE THAN ANY

01:20:40.035 --> 01:20:42.538 region:rollup2
OTHER STATE.

01:20:40.703 --> 01:20:44.440 region:rollup2
IN THE COUNTRY.

01:20:42.538 --> 01:20:45.908 region:rollup2
THE DATA I'VE SEEN SUGGESTS THAT

01:20:44.440 --> 01:20:47.142 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW ORGAN WASHINGTON ARE

01:20:45.908 --> 01:20:48.544 region:rollup2
RIGHT BEHIND US BUT THEY'RE

01:20:47.142 --> 01:20:51.747 region:rollup2
THEY'RE VALUE RISK IS LOWER BY A

01:20:48.544 --> 01:20:52.281 region:rollup2
FACTOR OF FIVE AND SO.

01:20:51.747 --> 01:20:54.750 region:rollup2
WE'RE IN A SOMEWHAT UNIQUE

01:20:52.281 --> 01:20:56.351 region:rollup2
SITUATION --

01:20:54.750 --> 01:20:58.520 region:rollup2
AND WE HAVE TO WORK WE HAVE TO

01:20:56.351 --> 01:21:00.756 region:rollup2
LEARN FROM ANALOGOUS PROGRAMS

01:20:58.520 --> 01:21:01.156 region:rollup2
AND ALSO DO SOME.

01:21:00.756 --> 01:21:03.659 region:rollup2
CREATIVE THINKING

01:21:01.156 --> 01:21:05.094 region:rollup2
EXPERIMENTATION --

01:21:03.659 --> 01:21:07.596 region:rollup2
THE ONE OTHER PIECE TO THIS THAT

01:21:05.094 --> 01:21:08.831 region:rollup2
I WOULD SUGGEST IS THAT.

01:21:07.596 --> 01:21:12.167 region:rollup2
THE BEST APPROACH IS ONE THAT

01:21:08.831 --> 01:21:14.436 region:rollup2
CREATES PROCESS OF LEARNING.

01:21:12.167 --> 01:21:17.005 region:rollup2
AND RE EVALUATION AND ITERATION

01:21:14.436 --> 01:21:18.273 region:rollup2
RATHER THAN SPECIFYING ANSWER.

01:21:17.005 --> 01:21:19.575 region:rollup2
RIGHT SO.

01:21:18.273 --> 01:21:21.009 region:rollup2
IN THIS IS TRUE.

01:21:19.575 --> 01:21:22.344 region:rollup2
ON THE PRIVATE LANDOWNER SIDE

01:21:21.009 --> 01:21:23.746 region:rollup2
IT'S ALSO TRUE IN THE UTILITY

01:21:22.344 --> 01:21:25.314 region:rollup2
SPACES WE THINK ABOUT WILDFIRE

01:21:23.746 --> 01:21:26.982 region:rollup2
PLANNING FOR UTILITIES WHAT WE

01:21:25.314 --> 01:21:28.951 region:rollup2
WANT UTILITIES TO DO.

01:21:26.982 --> 01:21:30.452 region:rollup2
IS TO BE OPEN ABOUT WHERE THEIR

01:21:28.951 --> 01:21:31.920 region:rollup2
SYSTEM FOR PLANNING IS WORKING

01:21:30.452 --> 01:21:33.655 region:rollup2
AND WHERE IT IS NOT.

01:21:31.920 --> 01:21:35.324 region:rollup2
AND NOT TO FEEL PRESSURE TO SAY

01:21:33.655 --> 01:21:36.959 region:rollup2
EVERYTHING'S FINE.

01:21:35.324 --> 01:21:38.694 region:rollup2
ALL GOOD HERE SO THAT THEY CAN

01:21:36.959 --> 01:21:40.095 region:rollup2
ACHIEVE COST RECOVERY AND THAT'S

01:21:38.694 --> 01:21:41.563 region:rollup2
A REAL TENSION RIGHT IT'S

01:21:40.095 --> 01:21:42.998 region:rollup2
ATTENTION BECAUSE THE UTILITIES

01:21:41.563 --> 01:21:44.266 region:rollup2
ARE GOING TO WANT.

01:21:42.998 --> 01:21:45.734 region:rollup2
TO BE CERTIFIED AS COMPLIANT

01:21:44.266 --> 01:21:47.803 region:rollup2
WITH WHATEVER PLAN [inaudible]

01:21:45.734 --> 01:21:49.638 region:rollup2
APPROVED.

01:21:47.803 --> 01:21:51.607 region:rollup2
PART OF THAT PLANNING PROCESS

01:21:49.638 --> 01:21:53.308 region:rollup2
NEEDS TO BE SOME ADMISSION OF

01:21:51.607 --> 01:21:54.243 region:rollup2
WHERE THINGS NEED WORK.

01:21:53.308 --> 01:21:57.513 region:rollup2
SO THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO

01:21:54.243 --> 01:22:00.382 region:rollup2
IMPROVE AND LEARN [inaudible]

01:21:57.513 --> 01:22:01.016 region:rollup2
SURE HOLD.

01:22:00.382 --> 01:22:04.386 region:rollup2
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I WANTED

01:22:01.016 --> 01:22:06.255 region:rollup2
--

01:22:04.386 --> 01:22:09.124 region:rollup2
TO SORT PICK UP IN THE AREA OF

01:22:06.255 --> 01:22:11.527 region:rollup2
THE INVERSE CONDEMNATION AND

01:22:09.124 --> 01:22:13.862 region:rollup2
MORE FROM THE STANDPOINT OF

01:22:11.527 --> 01:22:15.597 region:rollup2
OTHER STATES AND HOW.

01:22:13.862 --> 01:22:18.300 region:rollup2
IT APPLIES SIMILARLY TO

01:22:15.597 --> 01:22:20.002 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA'S AND AND AND WHAT'S

01:22:18.300 --> 01:22:21.036 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT HISTORICALLY AND HOW

01:22:20.002 --> 01:22:22.805 region:rollup2
THEY GOT TO WHERE.

01:22:21.036 --> 01:22:23.372 region:rollup2
THEY'RE APPLYING.

01:22:22.805 --> 01:22:25.541 region:rollup2
OF THIS DOCTRINE IN THE SAME

01:22:23.372 --> 01:22:27.242 region:rollup2
WAY.

01:22:25.541 --> 01:22:30.078 region:rollup2
VERSUS HOW WE MAY BE DOING IT OR

01:22:27.242 --> 01:22:33.882 region:rollup2
WHAT THE SIMULATORS MAY BE.

01:22:30.078 --> 01:22:36.051 region:rollup2
SO OTHER THAN ALABAMA.

01:22:33.882 --> 01:22:37.286 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA AS AS FAR AS OUR

01:22:36.051 --> 01:22:38.787 region:rollup2
RESEARCH HAS BEEN ABLE TO

01:22:37.286 --> 01:22:39.788 region:rollup2
DETERMINE IS THE ONLY STATE IN

01:22:38.787 --> 01:22:41.990 region:rollup2
THE COUNTRY WHERE INVERSE

01:22:39.788 --> 01:22:43.358 region:rollup2
CONDEMNATION HAS BEEN APPLIED TO

01:22:41.990 --> 01:22:45.527 region:rollup2
PRIVATE ENTITIES THAT HAVE THE

01:22:43.358 --> 01:22:47.396 region:rollup2
POWER OF EMINENT DOMAIN.

01:22:45.527 --> 01:22:48.363 region:rollup2
THAT BEING SAID IT IS WELL

01:22:47.396 --> 01:22:50.933 region:rollup2
ESTABLISHED LAW IN CALIFORNIA

01:22:48.363 --> 01:22:52.668 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:22:50.933 --> 01:22:53.669 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THESE PRIVATE ENTITIES

01:22:52.668 --> 01:22:55.170 region:rollup2
DO HAVE THE POWER OF EMINENT

01:22:53.669 --> 01:22:56.405 region:rollup2
DOMAIN.

01:22:55.170 --> 01:22:58.507 region:rollup2
THAT THEY SHOULD BE SUBJECT TO

01:22:56.405 --> 01:22:59.007 region:rollup2
SOME FORM.

01:22:58.507 --> 01:23:00.642 region:rollup2
BOB INVERSE CONDEMNATION

01:22:59.007 --> 01:23:02.377 region:rollup2
LIABILITY.

01:23:00.642 --> 01:23:05.714 region:rollup2
THE COURTS THOUGH IN CALIFORNIA

01:23:02.377 --> 01:23:06.982 region:rollup2
HAVE HAVE CREATED SOME NUANCE IN

01:23:05.714 --> 01:23:08.550 region:rollup2
THE DOCTRINE --

01:23:06.982 --> 01:23:09.852 region:rollup2
WHERE?

01:23:08.550 --> 01:23:11.587 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY IN CIRCUMSTANCES

01:23:09.852 --> 01:23:13.822 region:rollup2
WHERE THE LIABILITY MIGHT BE SO

01:23:11.587 --> 01:23:16.725 region:rollup2
CRUSHING LIKE THE RISKS CREATED

01:23:13.822 --> 01:23:17.993 region:rollup2
MIGHT BE SO DIFFICULT TO MANAGE.

01:23:16.725 --> 01:23:19.995 region:rollup2
THAT IT WOULD TO TURF PROVISION

01:23:17.993 --> 01:23:21.330 region:rollup2
OF THE PUBLIC BENEFIT.

01:23:19.995 --> 01:23:23.265 region:rollup2
RIGHT SO THERE'S A BALANCE THAT

01:23:21.330 --> 01:23:24.533 region:rollup2
HAS TO BE ACCOMPLISHED THERE

01:23:23.265 --> 01:23:26.835 region:rollup2
WHERE -- ON

01:23:24.533 --> 01:23:28.370 region:rollup2
THE ONE SIDE IS IS THE NEED TO

01:23:26.835 --> 01:23:30.405 region:rollup2
PROTECT INDIVIDUAL PROPERTY

01:23:28.370 --> 01:23:32.507 region:rollup2
OWNERS.

01:23:30.405 --> 01:23:34.076 region:rollup2
FROM PAYING HAVING BEING FORCED

01:23:32.507 --> 01:23:35.143 region:rollup2
TO PAY UNFAIRLY FOR THE

01:23:34.076 --> 01:23:36.345 region:rollup2
PROVISION OF SOME PUBLIC BENEFIT

01:23:35.143 --> 01:23:38.113 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THE HOUSE BURNS DOWN OR

01:23:36.345 --> 01:23:39.982 region:rollup2
ITS UNDERWATER BECAUSE A LEVEE

01:23:38.113 --> 01:23:42.184 region:rollup2
BREAKS -- ON

01:23:39.982 --> 01:23:44.686 region:rollup2
THE OTHER SIDE IS THE VERY

01:23:42.184 --> 01:23:46.421 region:rollup2
STRONG DESIRE OF THE STATE TO

01:23:44.686 --> 01:23:48.190 region:rollup2
SEE THAT THESE PUBLIC BENEFITS

01:23:46.421 --> 01:23:48.824 region:rollup2
ARE PROVIDED RIGHT AND WE'VE.

01:23:48.190 --> 01:23:50.993 region:rollup2
WE HAVE VERY STRONG PROTECTIONS

01:23:48.824 --> 01:23:52.561 region:rollup2
--

01:23:50.993 --> 01:23:53.795 region:rollup2
FOR ELECTRICITY CONSUMERS THAT

01:23:52.561 --> 01:23:55.297 region:rollup2
IN TERMS OF THE UTILITIES

01:23:53.795 --> 01:23:56.164 region:rollup2
OBLIGATION TO SERVE THAT WERE

01:23:55.297 --> 01:23:57.533 region:rollup2
REINFORCED DURING ELECTRICITY

01:23:56.164 --> 01:24:00.235 region:rollup2
CRISIS [inaudible]

01:23:57.533 --> 01:24:01.870 region:rollup2
AND AND SO UTILITIES ARE

01:24:00.235 --> 01:24:03.505 region:rollup2
OBLIGATED TO SERVE AND WE WANT

01:24:01.870 --> 01:24:05.707 region:rollup2
TO MAKE SURE THAT --

01:24:03.505 --> 01:24:08.577 region:rollup2
THEY DO SO AT A PRICE THAT'S

01:24:05.707 --> 01:24:10.312 region:rollup2
AFFORDABLE FOR EVERYONE --

01:24:08.577 --> 01:24:12.915 region:rollup2
AND NOTS WHERE ANY OF THERE'S A

01:24:10.312 --> 01:24:15.450 region:rollup2
QUESTION AND IT'S ONE FOR THE A

01:24:12.915 --> 01:24:16.518 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE TO CONSIDER --

01:24:15.450 --> 01:24:18.287 region:rollup2
WHETHER YOU KNOW WHETHER THE

01:24:16.518 --> 01:24:19.655 region:rollup2
RIGHT BALANCE IS BEING STRUCK.

01:24:18.287 --> 01:24:21.156 region:rollup2
AND I DON'T PRETEND TO KNOW THE

01:24:19.655 --> 01:24:23.191 region:rollup2
ANSWER TO THAT I THINK IT'S A

01:24:21.156 --> 01:24:26.028 region:rollup2
VERY POLITICALLY SENSITIVE

01:24:23.191 --> 01:24:27.296 region:rollup2
QUESTION DISABLED LEAST --

01:24:26.028 --> 01:24:27.863 region:rollup2
BUT IT THERE IS CERTAINLY

01:24:27.296 --> 01:24:29.498 region:rollup2
FLEXIBILITY UNDER CALIFORNIA

01:24:27.863 --> 01:24:31.900 region:rollup2
LAW.

01:24:29.498 --> 01:24:33.802 region:rollup2
IN OTHER STATES THESE INVESTOR

01:24:31.900 --> 01:24:35.704 region:rollup2
OWNED UTILITIES ARE SUBJECT TO A

01:24:33.802 --> 01:24:37.439 region:rollup2
NEGLIGENCE STANDARD.

01:24:35.704 --> 01:24:39.141 region:rollup2
WHEN AND WILD FIRES OCCUR?

01:24:37.439 --> 01:24:40.375 region:rollup2
RIGHT SO THEY IF THEY ARE

01:24:39.141 --> 01:24:41.476 region:rollup2

01:24:40.375 --> 01:24:42.678 region:rollup2
THEIR SYSTEMS AND A WILDFIRE

01:24:41.476 --> 01:24:44.513 region:rollup2
RESULTS [inaudible]

01:24:42.678 --> 01:24:46.448 region:rollup2
THEY'VE HAD.

01:24:44.513 --> 01:24:48.250 region:rollup2
IF THEY HAVE EXERCISED A

01:24:46.448 --> 01:24:50.819 region:rollup2
REASONABLE DUTY OF CARE.

01:24:48.250 --> 01:24:52.387 region:rollup2
THEY ARE NOT LIABLE --

01:24:50.819 --> 01:24:53.722 region:rollup2
AND SO WHEN YOU LOOK ACROSS THE

01:24:52.387 --> 01:24:54.990 region:rollup2
COUNTRY AND LOOK AT YOU KNOW

01:24:53.722 --> 01:24:56.325 region:rollup2
SORT OF WILD FIRES AND UTILITIES

01:24:54.990 --> 01:24:58.260 region:rollup2
WOULD YOU MOSTLY SEE IS THE

01:24:56.325 --> 01:24:59.494 region:rollup2
DISASTER RESPONSE ISSUES.

01:24:58.260 --> 01:25:00.762 region:rollup2

BURNT TO THE GROUND.

01:25:04.266 --> 01:25:09.571 region:rollup2
NOT SO MUCH THE ISSUE OF HOW THE

01:25:07.736 --> 01:25:10.238 region:rollup2
UTILITIES WOULD PAY.

01:25:09.571 --> 01:25:13.141 region:rollup2

01:25:10.238 --> 01:25:16.178 region:rollup2

LIAR OR IS THERE OTHER STATES

01:25:23.885 --> 01:25:26.455 region:rollup2
THAT HAVE THE DEFINITION OF

VERNE INVERSE CON MISSION ARE

01:25:26.455 --> 01:25:29.391 region:rollup2
ARE USE INVERSE COMMISSION SAME

01:25:27.956 --> 01:25:30.826 region:rollup2
WAY EXTENDED CALIFORNIA DOES.

01:25:29.391 --> 01:25:34.196 region:rollup2
WHAT MANY STATES APPLIED THE

01:25:30.826 --> 01:25:35.163 region:rollup2
SAME LAW TO PUBLIC ENTITIES

01:25:34.196 --> 01:25:36.431 region:rollup2

CONDEMNATION TO A PUBLIC ENTITY

01:25:39.568 --> 01:25:43.772 region:rollup2
THAT --

01:25:40.302 --> 01:25:45.240 region:rollup2
TAKES PRIVATE PROPERTY EITHER

01:25:43.772 --> 01:25:45.774 region:rollup2
INTENTIONALLY THAT'S SENATE MAIN

01:25:45.240 --> 01:25:48.276 region:rollup2

01:25:48.276 --> 01:25:52.614 region:rollup2
ONLY ALABAMA INSOFAR AS WE CAN

01:25:50.312 --> 01:25:55.017 region:rollup2
TELL HAS CASE LAW SUGGESTING

01:25:52.614 --> 01:25:57.486 region:rollup2
THAT INVERSE CONDEMNATION SHOULD

01:25:55.017 --> 01:25:59.254 region:rollup2
BE APPLIED TO PRIVATELY OWNED

01:25:57.486 --> 01:26:00.922 region:rollup2

POWER OF EMINENT DOMAIN.

01:26:00.922 --> 01:26:04.092 region:rollup2
SO THAT COULD BE YOU KNOW IT'S

01:26:02.891 --> 01:26:06.294 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT IT'S NETWORK INDUSTRIES

01:26:04.092 --> 01:26:07.462 region:rollup2
JESSA ALABAMA IN CALIFORNIA YES

01:26:06.294 --> 01:26:08.597 region:rollup2
AND I WOULD JUST ADD THAT IN

01:26:07.462 --> 01:26:10.766 region:rollup2
ALABAMA.

01:26:08.597 --> 01:26:12.000 region:rollup2
THE ALABAMA CASE IS MORE AKIN TO

01:26:10.766 --> 01:26:13.702 region:rollup2
THE EARLY INVERSE CONDEMNATION

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:15.103 region:rollup2
CASES IN CALIFORNIA WHERE THE

01:26:13.702 --> 01:26:17.406 region:rollup2
LEVEL OF DAMAGES IS VERY MODEST.

01:26:15.103 --> 01:26:18.840 region:rollup2
IT IS NOT LIKE.

01:26:17.406 --> 01:26:21.109 region:rollup2
THE SITUATION WE FACE TODAY

01:26:18.840 --> 01:26:22.577 region:rollup2
WHERE THE LEVEL OF DAMAGES

01:26:21.109 --> 01:26:24.846 region:rollup2
SUPPOSES YOU KNOW KIND OF AN

01:26:22.577 --> 01:26:25.714 region:rollup2
ENTERPRISE LEVEL RISK TO THE

01:26:24.846 --> 01:26:28.116 region:rollup2

01:26:25.714 --> 01:26:29.885 region:rollup2

01:29:37.739 --> 01:29:39.908 region:rollup2
THAT SERVICES OF ACT.

01:29:38.573 --> 01:29:42.744 region:rollup2
AVAILABLE AND THAT THEIR

01:29:39.908 --> 01:29:44.246 region:rollup2
CONSUMER PROTECTIONS IN PLACE.

01:29:42.744 --> 01:29:45.280 region:rollup2
WE'RE ABOUT TO ADOPT THOSE

01:29:44.246 --> 01:29:46.748 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR MEASURES IN A

01:29:45.280 --> 01:29:50.518 region:rollup2
PROPOSED DECISION WHICH IS OUT

01:29:46.748 --> 01:29:52.454 region:rollup2
FOR PUBLIC COMMENT.

01:29:50.518 --> 01:29:53.989 region:rollup2
AND AND UNDER EXISTING LAW SO

01:29:52.454 --> 01:29:55.624 region:rollup2
WERE TASKED WITH REVIEWING

01:29:53.989 --> 01:29:57.025 region:rollup2
WILDFIRE PREVENTION PLAN

01:29:55.624 --> 01:29:57.592 region:rollup2
SUBMITTED BY THE UTILITIES WHICH

01:29:57.025 --> 01:29:58.727 region:rollup2
ARE --

01:29:57.592 --> 01:30:01.329 region:rollup2
DIRECTOR OF SAFETY IN

01:29:58.727 --> 01:30:03.031 region:rollup2
ENFORCEMENT DIVISION POLICE VEDA

01:30:01.329 --> 01:30:03.331 region:rollup2
MALASHENKO CAN SPEAK

01:30:03.031 --> 01:30:05.300 region:rollup2
[inaudible]

01:30:03.331 --> 01:30:07.135 region:rollup2
TO HI.

01:30:05.300 --> 01:30:08.536 region:rollup2
ANOTHER IMPORTANT --

01:30:07.135 --> 01:30:09.971 region:rollup2
EFFORT HAS BEEN TO WORK MUCH

01:30:08.536 --> 01:30:12.040 region:rollup2
MORE CLOSELY WITH OTHER STATE

01:30:09.971 --> 01:30:14.342 region:rollup2
SAFETY AGENCIES WHILE UNDER THE

01:30:12.040 --> 01:30:15.844 region:rollup2
CONSTITUTION WE ARE DEEMED A

01:30:14.342 --> 01:30:18.179 region:rollup2
INDEPENDENT AGENCY.

01:30:15.844 --> 01:30:19.781 region:rollup2
IT JUST DOESN'T WORK UNLESS WE

01:30:18.179 --> 01:30:21.249 region:rollup2
WORK WITH THE OTHER AGENCIES WHO

01:30:19.781 --> 01:30:22.817 region:rollup2
ARE ALSO WORKING IN THE SAME

01:30:21.249 --> 01:30:26.221 region:rollup2
FIELDS THAT WE ARE.

01:30:22.817 --> 01:30:28.189 region:rollup2
SO WHILE WE HAVE AGREEMENTS --

01:30:26.221 --> 01:30:30.258 region:rollup2
DO THE DIRECTOR MALASHENKO IS

01:30:28.189 --> 01:30:31.493 region:rollup2
LEADERSHIP OF WITH OFFICE OF

01:30:30.258 --> 01:30:34.262 region:rollup2
EMERGENCY SERVICES AND WORKOUT

01:30:31.493 --> 01:30:36.231 region:rollup2
WITH CAL FIRE. ONE OF THE

01:30:34.262 --> 01:30:37.866 region:rollup2
PRIMARY FOCUSES OF OUR WORK WITH

01:30:36.231 --> 01:30:39.834 region:rollup2
CAL FIRE HAS BEEN THE EFFORT TO

01:30:37.866 --> 01:30:41.803 region:rollup2
TARGET STRINGENT TREE IN

01:30:39.834 --> 01:30:43.271 region:rollup2
VEGETATION MANAGEMENT.

01:30:41.803 --> 01:30:45.974 region:rollup2
WHICH REQUIRED TRANSFORMING

01:30:43.271 --> 01:30:47.575 region:rollup2
EARLIER STATE FIRE MAPS FROM A

01:30:45.974 --> 01:30:49.277 region:rollup2
GENERAL MODELING GENERAL FIRE

01:30:47.575 --> 01:30:52.047 region:rollup2
HAZARDS TO REAL STATE OF THE

01:30:49.277 --> 01:30:54.516 region:rollup2
MARK ART MODEL THAT FOCUSES ON

01:30:52.047 --> 01:30:56.017 region:rollup2
IGNITION RISK DUE TO AND UTILITY

01:30:54.516 --> 01:30:58.453 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE IN DROUGHT.

01:30:56.017 --> 01:31:00.088 region:rollup2
IN EXTREME FIRE WIND EVENTS.

01:30:58.453 --> 01:31:01.323 region:rollup2
BUT BEYOND THAT WE THINK THAT

01:31:00.088 --> 01:31:03.491 region:rollup2
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT FOR US TO

01:31:01.323 --> 01:31:04.926 region:rollup2
DEVELOP A SINGLE COMPREHENSIVE

01:31:03.491 --> 01:31:05.760 region:rollup2
DATABASE OF THE FOUR POINT TWO

01:31:04.926 --> 01:31:07.329 region:rollup2
MILLION --

01:31:05.760 --> 01:31:09.164 region:rollup2
WOODEN POLES TO CARRY CRITICAL

01:31:07.329 --> 01:31:10.532 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE WHO OWNS THEM

01:31:09.164 --> 01:31:12.067 region:rollup2
THEY'RE UPDATED CONDITIONS

01:31:10.532 --> 01:31:13.335 region:rollup2
WHAT'S ATTACHED THAT'S VERY

01:31:12.067 --> 01:31:14.903 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT PARTICULARLY IN

01:31:13.335 --> 01:31:18.406 region:rollup2
WINDSTORMS IS --

01:31:14.903 --> 01:31:19.941 region:rollup2
HAS EACH PIECE OF HAITIANS OR

01:31:18.406 --> 01:31:21.009 region:rollup2
ELECTRIC INFRASTRUCTURE THAT'S

01:31:19.941 --> 01:31:22.344 region:rollup2
ATTACHED TO PULL ACTS LIKE A

01:31:21.009 --> 01:31:23.979 region:rollup2
SEAL.

01:31:22.344 --> 01:31:26.548 region:rollup2
YOU CAN MAKE THEM SUSCEPTIBLE TO

01:31:23.979 --> 01:31:28.717 region:rollup2
OVERTOPPING A BREAKAGE.

01:31:26.548 --> 01:31:30.118 region:rollup2
AND HOW THAT LOADING CAN --

01:31:28.717 --> 01:31:32.620 region:rollup2
CAN AFFECT THE POTENTIAL FOR

01:31:30.118 --> 01:31:34.189 region:rollup2
FAILURES IN PUBLIC SAFETY SO.

01:31:32.620 --> 01:31:35.824 region:rollup2
WERE ALSO REFINING NEW RULES FOR

01:31:34.189 --> 01:31:37.892 region:rollup2
ENFORCEMENT WHICH BEEN LACKING

01:31:35.824 --> 01:31:40.128 region:rollup2
WITH TELECOM EQUIPMENT ISN'T DUH

01:31:37.892 --> 01:31:42.564 region:rollup2
WELL ATTACHED FOR HASN'T BEEN --

01:31:40.128 --> 01:31:44.032 region:rollup2
REPLACED IN A TIMELY FASHION.

01:31:42.564 --> 01:31:46.067 region:rollup2
WHEN HE WENT ELECTRIC UTILITY

01:31:44.032 --> 01:31:48.136 region:rollup2
REPLACES A POLL WE I RECENTLY

01:31:46.067 --> 01:31:50.171 region:rollup2
TOURED A VARIETY OF --

01:31:48.136 --> 01:31:52.774 region:rollup2
OF SETTINGS IN --

01:31:50.171 --> 01:31:54.909 region:rollup2
IN SANTA CLARA THIS IS A FOLLOW

01:31:52.774 --> 01:31:56.511 region:rollup2
ON TO MY VISITS TO TO OTHER FIRE

01:31:54.909 --> 01:31:58.413 region:rollup2
SITES IN CALIFORNIA.

01:31:56.511 --> 01:31:59.647 region:rollup2
AND FREQUENTLY WHAT WE SEE IS

01:31:58.413 --> 01:32:01.016 region:rollup2
THAT THE ELECTRIC UTILITY

01:31:59.647 --> 01:32:02.784 region:rollup2
WORKPLACE THE PAUL.

01:32:01.016 --> 01:32:04.185 region:rollup2
A TELECOMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT

01:32:02.784 --> 01:32:05.186 region:rollup2
IS JUST SORT OF DANGLING THERE

01:32:04.185 --> 01:32:07.722 region:rollup2
OR IS ATTACHED WITH ROPES AND

01:32:05.186 --> 01:32:09.924 region:rollup2
THEY DON'T RISK.

01:32:07.722 --> 01:32:12.093 region:rollup2
ON THAT'S A HACER.

01:32:09.924 --> 01:32:13.561 region:rollup2
WHAT I DO NEED TO POINT OUT I

01:32:12.093 --> 01:32:15.163 region:rollup2
THINK IT'S BEEN STATED IN SOME

01:32:13.561 --> 01:32:16.531 region:rollup2
RESPECTS?

01:32:15.163 --> 01:32:18.867 region:rollup2
THAT MORE AND MORE PEOPLE ARE

01:32:16.531 --> 01:32:20.735 region:rollup2
MOVING INTO AREAS OF ELEVATED

01:32:18.867 --> 01:32:22.203 region:rollup2
AND SEVERE FIRE RISK WHAT WE

01:32:20.735 --> 01:32:23.405 region:rollup2
CALL THOUGH WILDLAND URBAN

01:32:22.203 --> 01:32:24.773 region:rollup2
INTERFACE.

01:32:23.405 --> 01:32:26.541 region:rollup2
SO IN THE NORTH PART OF STATE

01:32:24.773 --> 01:32:28.610 region:rollup2
THAT'S RECALL WE'VE ARE ON THIS

01:32:26.541 --> 01:32:30.078 region:rollup2
YEAR AND AND SISKIYOU IN FORCE

01:32:28.610 --> 01:32:32.547 region:rollup2
BUTTON SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA

01:32:30.078 --> 01:32:34.549 region:rollup2
THAT'S RECALL WE CHAPARRAL.

01:32:32.547 --> 01:32:36.484 region:rollup2
AND HERE IN THE CENTRAL PART OF

01:32:34.549 --> 01:32:37.819 region:rollup2
THE STATE HITS OAK WOODLAND ALL

01:32:36.484 --> 01:32:39.254 region:rollup2
OF THESE DIFFERENT --

01:32:37.819 --> 01:32:40.889 region:rollup2
PHONE FIRE SETTINGS HAVE

01:32:39.254 --> 01:32:41.856 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT CHARACTERISTICS AND

01:32:40.889 --> 01:32:44.059 region:rollup2
PRESENT DIFFERENT KINDS OF

01:32:41.856 --> 01:32:46.528 region:rollup2
CHALLENGES.

01:32:44.059 --> 01:32:48.463 region:rollup2
WE'RE NOT FIRE SCIENTISTS WERE

01:32:46.528 --> 01:32:50.665 region:rollup2
NOT BY BOTANISTS WERE ECONOMIC

01:32:48.463 --> 01:32:52.367 region:rollup2
REGULATORS LEESER HARD THINGS

01:32:50.665 --> 01:32:53.735 region:rollup2
FOR US TO UNDERSTAND.

01:32:52.367 --> 01:32:55.703 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S WHY WE PRIZED ARE

01:32:53.735 --> 01:32:57.272 region:rollup2
GROWING RELATIONSHIP WITH CAL

01:32:55.703 --> 01:32:58.339 region:rollup2
FIRE BECAUSE OF THEIR FIRE THEIR

01:32:57.272 --> 01:32:59.641 region:rollup2
SCIENTISTS.

01:32:58.339 --> 01:33:02.911 region:rollup2
AND BECAUSE OF THEIR KNOWLEDGE

01:32:59.641 --> 01:33:03.778 region:rollup2
ABOUT FIRE BEHAVIOR. ONE OF THE

01:33:02.911 --> 01:33:05.146 region:rollup2
THINGS THAT WE LEARNED FROM

01:33:03.778 --> 01:33:06.815 region:rollup2
WORKING WITH THEM IS THAT THE

01:33:05.146 --> 01:33:08.249 region:rollup2
SIZE OF THE FIRE RISK AREAS

01:33:06.815 --> 01:33:10.051 region:rollup2
GROWN PRETTY DRAMATICALLY THIS

01:33:08.249 --> 01:33:11.453 region:rollup2
PREVIOUS FIREMEN UP WHICH WE

01:33:10.051 --> 01:33:13.121 region:rollup2
CALLED THE INTERIM FIRE MAPS

01:33:11.453 --> 01:33:13.655 region:rollup2
FIRE THREAT MATCH COVERED ABOUT

01:33:13.121 --> 01:33:14.823 region:rollup2
THIRTY ONE THOUSAND SQUARE

01:33:13.655 --> 01:33:16.458 region:rollup2
MILES.

01:33:14.823 --> 01:33:17.892 region:rollup2
THE NEW MAP MORE THAN DOUBLES

01:33:16.458 --> 01:33:19.394 region:rollup2
THAT TO SEVENTY THOUSAND SQUARE

01:33:17.892 --> 01:33:19.994 region:rollup2
MILES.

01:33:19.394 --> 01:33:23.398 region:rollup2
THAT'S 44% CALIFORNIA'S LANMAN

01:33:19.994 --> 01:33:24.899 region:rollup2
--

01:33:23.398 --> 01:33:26.901 region:rollup2
THE NEW MAP ALSO INCLUDES

01:33:24.899 --> 01:33:28.036 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA TREE MORTALITY HIGH

01:33:26.901 --> 01:33:30.839 region:rollup2
HAZARD ZONES WHICH ENCOMPASS

01:33:28.036 --> 01:33:32.407 region:rollup2
ABOUT NINE MILLION ACRES AND

01:33:30.839 --> 01:33:34.209 region:rollup2
ABOUT A HUNDRED AND TWENTY NINE

01:33:32.407 --> 01:33:36.177 region:rollup2
MILLION TREES WITH DIED TO

01:33:34.209 --> 01:33:37.111 region:rollup2
DROUGHT AND BARK BEETLES.

01:33:36.177 --> 01:33:38.613 region:rollup2
SO I THINK THIS IS THAT'S

01:33:37.111 --> 01:33:40.949 region:rollup2
PRINCIPALLY IN THE SIERRA

01:33:38.613 --> 01:33:42.851 region:rollup2
FORESTS IN THE SISKIYOU USE BUT

01:33:40.949 --> 01:33:45.620 region:rollup2
WE ALSO HAVE PROBLEMS IN TERMS

01:33:42.851 --> 01:33:47.322 region:rollup2
OF ADVANCING ON DIE TEMPERATURES

01:33:45.620 --> 01:33:49.123 region:rollup2
CLIMATE CHANGE AFFECTING OTHER

01:33:47.322 --> 01:33:51.259 region:rollup2
TREE POPULATIONS.

01:33:49.123 --> 01:33:53.261 region:rollup2
SO WHEN PEOPLE MOVE FURTHER OUT

01:33:51.259 --> 01:33:55.263 region:rollup2
FROM DENSE URBAN CONCENTRATIONS

01:33:53.261 --> 01:33:55.630 region:rollup2
THEIR NEEDS AND THEIR DEMAND FOR

01:33:55.263 --> 01:33:56.631 region:rollup2
ELECTRICITY AND

01:33:55.630 --> 01:33:57.765 region:rollup2
TELECOMMUNICATIONS

01:33:56.631 --> 01:33:59.901 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE [inaudible]

01:33:57.765 --> 01:34:01.970 region:rollup2
CHENEY'S.

01:33:59.901 --> 01:34:03.671 region:rollup2
WE DON'T TELL THEM TO MOVE THEIR

01:34:01.970 --> 01:34:05.406 region:rollup2
WE TELL THE UTILITIES THE YOU

01:34:03.671 --> 01:34:06.374 region:rollup2
HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO SERVE.

01:34:05.406 --> 01:34:09.511 region:rollup2
YOU HAVE TO PROVIDE THEM WITH

01:34:06.374 --> 01:34:11.146 region:rollup2
THAT INFEST --

01:34:09.511 --> 01:34:12.213 region:rollup2
SO THAT.

01:34:11.146 --> 01:34:15.216 region:rollup2
PUTS MORE --

01:34:12.213 --> 01:34:17.218 region:rollup2
STRAIN ON OUR RESOURCES THE FIRE

01:34:15.216 --> 01:34:20.255 region:rollup2
AGENCIES AND AND AND YOU TOLD

01:34:17.218 --> 01:34:21.823 region:rollup2
THE SERVICE PROVIDERS WE

01:34:20.255 --> 01:34:23.825 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY REQUIRE.

01:34:21.823 --> 01:34:26.694 region:rollup2
UTILITIES TO CONNECT VIRTUALLY

01:34:23.825 --> 01:34:28.229 region:rollup2
EVERY HOME EVERY BUILDING.

01:34:26.694 --> 01:34:29.397 region:rollup2
IN EVERY BUSINESS IN THESE

01:34:28.229 --> 01:34:31.266 region:rollup2
GROWING FIRE RISK AREAS THERE'S

01:34:29.397 --> 01:34:32.700 region:rollup2
ABOUT OF ONE POINT FOUR MILLION

01:34:31.266 --> 01:34:35.737 region:rollup2
HOUSING UNITS.

01:34:32.700 --> 01:34:36.738 region:rollup2
AND WHO LIVE WITH THAT IN WITHIN

01:34:35.737 --> 01:34:38.940 region:rollup2
THIS FIRE --

01:34:36.738 --> 01:34:40.175 region:rollup2
THREATS OWNS WE ESTIMATE THAT

01:34:38.940 --> 01:34:42.443 region:rollup2
THERE'S ABOUT A MILLION WOODEN

01:34:40.175 --> 01:34:43.778 region:rollup2
POLES AND TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND

01:34:42.443 --> 01:34:45.380 region:rollup2

01:34:46.481 --> 01:34:49.317 region:rollup2
SPANNING FIRE HAZARD ZONES JUST

01:34:48.616 --> 01:34:51.753 region:rollup2
TO SERVE THESE GROWING

01:34:49.317 --> 01:34:53.688 region:rollup2
POPULATIONS.

01:34:51.753 --> 01:34:56.024 region:rollup2
ARE WE NEED REAL STRONG CENTRAL

01:34:53.688 --> 01:34:57.692 region:rollup2
MANAGEMENT OF THE GRID FOR

VEGETATION MANAGEMENT MORE

01:34:57.692 --> 01:35:01.229 region:rollup2
DETAILED WILDFIRE MAPS --

01:34:59.561 --> 01:35:02.764 region:rollup2
WE NEED TO CONTINUE VARGAS AN

01:35:01.229 --> 01:35:04.065 region:rollup2
EXISTING WILD FIRE MITIGATION

01:35:02.764 --> 01:35:05.633 region:rollup2

01:35:04.065 --> 01:35:07.135 region:rollup2
UTILITIES ARE IMPLEMENTING THE

01:35:05.633 --> 01:35:09.037 region:rollup2
PLANTS UPDATING THE PLANTS

01:35:07.135 --> 01:35:10.505 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY ADDRESSING.

01:35:09.037 --> 01:35:14.442 region:rollup2
THE SAFETY CULTURES THAT THE

01:35:10.505 --> 01:35:15.543 region:rollup2
UTILITIES I BELIEVE THAT --

01:35:14.442 --> 01:35:17.045 region:rollup2
DOCTOR OR SPOKE TO THAT.

01:35:15.543 --> 01:35:18.880 region:rollup2
THIS IS A CHALLENGE FOR US WE

01:35:17.045 --> 01:35:20.848 region:rollup2
STARTED TO ACTUALLY AUDIT TOP TO

01:35:18.880 --> 01:35:23.051 region:rollup2
BOTTOM HOME A ONE UTILITY TO

01:35:20.848 --> 01:35:25.887 region:rollup2
BEGIN TO UNDERSTAND HOW IS IT.

01:35:23.051 --> 01:35:28.256 region:rollup2
THAT TOP TO BOTTOM EVERYBODY IS

01:35:25.887 --> 01:35:29.891 region:rollup2
CONSCIOUS AND ACTIVE ON THESE

01:35:28.256 --> 01:35:30.959 region:rollup2
ISSUES WHAT IS THE BOARD.

01:35:29.891 --> 01:35:32.794 region:rollup2
TO WHEN THEY HEAR ABOUT AN

01:35:30.959 --> 01:35:34.629 region:rollup2
INCIDENT HOW DO THEY REACT WHAT

01:35:32.794 --> 01:35:35.597 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS DO THEY ASK WHAT TAX

01:35:34.629 --> 01:35:38.399 region:rollup2
INTO THEY TAKE WHO DO THEY HOLD

01:35:35.597 --> 01:35:40.134 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTABLE --

01:35:38.399 --> 01:35:42.036 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT WE ALSO WERE

01:35:40.134 --> 01:35:44.239 region:rollup2
INTERESTED IN IN IN OTHER

01:35:42.036 --> 01:35:46.007 region:rollup2
AGENCIES ESTABLISHING --

01:35:44.239 --> 01:35:47.208 region:rollup2
BEST PRACTICE MODELS FOR ZONING

01:35:46.007 --> 01:35:49.677 region:rollup2
AND BUILDING CODES.

01:35:47.208 --> 01:35:51.846 region:rollup2
ARE AND DUH I ALSO MENTION INTO

01:35:49.677 --> 01:35:53.381 region:rollup2
CONCURRENCE IN THE CPUC WILDFIRE

01:35:51.846 --> 01:35:57.819 region:rollup2
DECISION WE HAVE --

01:35:53.381 --> 01:36:00.688 region:rollup2
TO REFINE THE LEGAL FRAME.

01:35:57.819 --> 01:36:02.257 region:rollup2
TAKE COUNT ALL THESE CHANGES.

01:36:00.688 --> 01:36:03.891 region:rollup2
I HAVE TO SAY THAT MANAGING AN

01:36:02.257 --> 01:36:05.526 region:rollup2
OPERA IN THE GRID ITSELF CAN'T

01:36:03.891 --> 01:36:06.961 region:rollup2
BE PARCELED OUT EASILY.

01:36:05.526 --> 01:36:08.663 region:rollup2
JUST LIKE THE INTERSTATE HIGHWAY

01:36:06.961 --> 01:36:09.497 region:rollup2
SYSTEM THE WIRES AND POLES OF

01:36:08.663 --> 01:36:11.199 region:rollup2
THE GRID HAVE TO HAVE SOME

01:36:09.497 --> 01:36:12.767 region:rollup2
CONSISTENT MANAGEMENT ACROSS

01:36:11.199 --> 01:36:14.269 region:rollup2
GEOGRAPHY IN ORDER TO OPERATE

01:36:12.767 --> 01:36:15.870 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVELY.

01:36:14.269 --> 01:36:17.839 region:rollup2
VOLTAGES HAVE TO MATCH UP.

01:36:15.870 --> 01:36:19.507 region:rollup2
WHERE YOU HAVE A SITUATION LOS

01:36:17.839 --> 01:36:21.042 region:rollup2
ANGELES IT LAUP IT HAS DIFFERENT

01:36:19.507 --> 01:36:23.177 region:rollup2
VOLTAGES THAN THE REST OF THE

01:36:21.042 --> 01:36:25.280 region:rollup2
STATE'S GRITS MAKES IT VERY HARD

01:36:23.177 --> 01:36:26.648 region:rollup2
TO SHARE RESOURCES AND AND ANTI

01:36:25.280 --> 01:36:28.016 region:rollup2
TIMES?

01:36:26.648 --> 01:36:29.884 region:rollup2
OPERATORS HAVE TO HAVE VERY

01:36:28.016 --> 01:36:31.586 region:rollup2
CLOSE COMMUNICATION ESSENTIALLY

01:36:29.884 --> 01:36:33.321 region:rollup2
TO THE MILLISECOND.

01:36:31.586 --> 01:36:34.589 region:rollup2
THE ARCHITECTURE THE GRID HAS TO

01:36:33.321 --> 01:36:35.857 region:rollup2
BE CAREFULLY DESIGNED SO THE

01:36:34.589 --> 01:36:38.693 region:rollup2
POWER GOES WHERE IT'S SUPPOSED

01:36:35.857 --> 01:36:40.328 region:rollup2
TO GO -- AND

01:36:38.693 --> 01:36:40.862 region:rollup2
WITH THE FORCE IT'S WELL WITHIN

01:36:40.328 --> 01:36:42.430 region:rollup2
THE DESIGNED LIMITS OF THE

01:36:40.862 --> 01:36:44.198 region:rollup2
SYSTEM.

01:36:42.430 --> 01:36:46.367 region:rollup2
SO HERE THE YOU THE ROLE THE

01:36:44.198 --> 01:36:48.569 region:rollup2
UTILITY IS NOT BY CONTRACT FROM

01:36:46.367 --> 01:36:50.271 region:rollup2
INDEPENDENT GENERATORS TO AND

01:36:48.569 --> 01:36:51.673 region:rollup2
THEN TO TO WE'LL THAT

01:36:50.271 --> 01:36:53.675 region:rollup2
ELECTRICITY TO CUSTOMERS.

01:36:51.673 --> 01:36:56.344 region:rollup2
BUT IS TO PROVIDE A RELIABLE AND

01:36:53.675 --> 01:36:58.012 region:rollup2
SAFE DELIVERY SERVICE FROM OF

01:36:56.344 --> 01:36:59.314 region:rollup2
VERY COMPLEX MACHINE.

01:36:58.012 --> 01:37:01.315 region:rollup2
IT LOOKS.

01:36:59.314 --> 01:37:03.084 region:rollup2
PEOPLE SEE PART WIRES AND POLES

01:37:01.315 --> 01:37:08.156 region:rollup2
BUT IT'S NOT IT'S VERY DYNAMIC

01:37:03.084 --> 01:37:09.691 region:rollup2
HOW IT OPERATES --

01:37:08.156 --> 01:37:11.359 region:rollup2
WIRES AMPLE --

01:37:09.691 --> 01:37:14.128 region:rollup2
PULLS IN UTILITY EQUIPMENT TO

01:37:11.359 --> 01:37:14.595 region:rollup2
LOOK DELINEATE A VERY IMPORTANT

01:37:14.128 --> 01:37:15.997 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:37:14.595 --> 01:37:18.132 region:rollup2
I HAVE TO STRESS THE FACT THAT

01:37:15.997 --> 01:37:19.434 region:rollup2
THE NETWORK IS NOT EASY TO TO

01:37:18.132 --> 01:37:20.968 region:rollup2
DIVIDE.

01:37:19.434 --> 01:37:22.337 region:rollup2
COMPLEX IN ITS A LARGE

01:37:20.968 --> 01:37:24.072 region:rollup2
UNDERTAKING THAT PROVIDES AN

01:37:22.337 --> 01:37:25.139 region:rollup2
ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF VALUE TO

01:37:24.072 --> 01:37:26.374 region:rollup2
CUSTOMERS NOT JUST --

01:37:25.139 --> 01:37:28.976 region:rollup2
ELECTRICITY BUT ALSO

01:37:26.374 --> 01:37:31.779 region:rollup2
TELECOMMUNICATIONS.

01:37:28.976 --> 01:37:34.349 region:rollup2
SO WHAT I HAVE TO I CAN'T.

01:37:31.779 --> 01:37:35.983 region:rollup2
GO ARE FEW FALSE ASSURANCES LIKE

01:37:34.349 --> 01:37:37.685 region:rollup2
IN A WAY I THINK THAT THAT'S NOT

01:37:35.983 --> 01:37:38.286 region:rollup2
RIGHT.

01:37:37.685 --> 01:37:38.986 region:rollup2
PEOPLE NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT

01:37:38.286 --> 01:37:40.521 region:rollup2
--

01:37:38.986 --> 01:37:41.522 region:rollup2
IT WHILE IT'S CHIU OUR NEW FAR

01:37:40.521 --> 01:37:42.390 region:rollup2
ROLES ARE THE TOUGHEST IN THE

01:37:41.522 --> 01:37:44.092 region:rollup2
COUNTRY.

01:37:42.390 --> 01:37:45.660 region:rollup2
WILL ALSO BE EXPENSIVE TO

01:37:44.092 --> 01:37:48.129 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENT WE PROBABLY COULD HAVE

01:37:45.660 --> 01:37:49.564 region:rollup2
GONE FURTHER BUT OUR RATE PAIR

01:37:48.129 --> 01:37:52.166 region:rollup2
ADVOCATES REMINDED US.

01:37:49.564 --> 01:37:53.501 region:rollup2
THAT THERE'S A COST THE SAFETY

01:37:52.166 --> 01:37:54.769 region:rollup2
THEY OPPOSED THE NEW FIRE AND

01:37:53.501 --> 01:37:57.004 region:rollup2
VEGETATION MAN [inaudible]

01:37:54.769 --> 01:37:58.373 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS.

01:37:57.004 --> 01:38:00.041 region:rollup2
THERE WE NEED TO CONSTANTLY

01:37:58.373 --> 01:38:01.142 region:rollup2
EVALUATE THIS COST TO MAKE SURE

01:38:00.041 --> 01:38:03.411 region:rollup2
THE RATES ARE ARE JUST AND

01:38:01.142 --> 01:38:05.713 region:rollup2
REASONABLE --

01:38:03.411 --> 01:38:07.782 region:rollup2
BUT I HAVE TO SAY THAT JUST

01:38:05.713 --> 01:38:08.082 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE HAVE A PLAN

01:38:07.782 --> 01:38:10.318 region:rollup2
[inaudible]

01:38:08.082 --> 01:38:12.053 region:rollup2
DOESN'T REALLY.

01:38:10.318 --> 01:38:13.888 region:rollup2
ALLOW THE UTILITIES ARE OFF THE

01:38:12.053 --> 01:38:15.590 region:rollup2
HOOK WE CAN'T JUST BECAUSE WE

01:38:13.888 --> 01:38:16.858 region:rollup2
APPROVE A PLAN IT'S NOT

01:38:15.590 --> 01:38:18.459 region:rollup2
SUFFICIENT AND THE ULTIMATELY

01:38:16.858 --> 01:38:20.628 region:rollup2
HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO OPERATE

01:38:18.459 --> 01:38:22.230 region:rollup2
THEIRS THEIR SYSTEMS --

01:38:20.628 --> 01:38:24.132 region:rollup2
SAFELY AND BASED ON ON THE

01:38:22.230 --> 01:38:24.966 region:rollup2
STANDARDS.

01:38:24.132 --> 01:38:26.667 region:rollup2
SO WE GET BETTER SETTING OF

01:38:24.966 --> 01:38:28.336 region:rollup2
STANDARDS.

01:38:26.667 --> 01:38:30.204 region:rollup2
WE'VE DONE THAT WE'VE ADOPTED TO

01:38:28.336 --> 01:38:31.973 region:rollup2
CHANGING AND ON EXPECTED

01:38:30.204 --> 01:38:34.242 region:rollup2
CONDITIONS THE NEUFELD

01:38:31.973 --> 01:38:35.843 region:rollup2
VEGETATION MAPPING DUE IN PART

01:38:34.242 --> 01:38:36.844 region:rollup2
WHAT -- WHAT

01:38:35.843 --> 01:38:38.346 region:rollup2
THE --

01:38:36.844 --> 01:38:39.580 region:rollup2
PROFESSOR WORSE AT THE ARE GOING

01:38:38.346 --> 01:38:42.817 region:rollup2
TO REALLY.

01:38:39.580 --> 01:38:44.285 region:rollup2
REQUIRE CUTTING BACK --

01:38:42.817 --> 01:38:45.987 region:rollup2
OF VEGETATION IN CERTAIN PARTS

01:38:44.285 --> 01:38:47.855 region:rollup2
OF THE STATE.

01:38:45.987 --> 01:38:49.791 region:rollup2
NOT EVERYWHERE THE PLACES THAT

01:38:47.855 --> 01:38:50.091 region:rollup2
WE CURRENTLY HAVE IDENTIFIED

01:38:49.791 --> 01:38:51.659 region:rollup2
[inaudible]

01:38:50.091 --> 01:38:53.861 region:rollup2
MY SUSPICION.

01:38:51.659 --> 01:38:56.731 region:rollup2
IS THAT WITH THE ADVANCING TEMAS

01:38:53.861 --> 01:38:58.499 region:rollup2
TEMPERATURE ONGOING DROUGHTS.

01:38:56.731 --> 01:39:00.168 region:rollup2
TEEN YOU'D DUH MOVEMENT OF

01:38:58.499 --> 01:39:02.703 region:rollup2
POPULATION STE A FIRE HAZARD

01:39:00.168 --> 01:39:03.971 region:rollup2
AREAS WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE TO

01:39:02.703 --> 01:39:05.706 region:rollup2
ADAPT THOSE MAPS DURING CREDIBLY

01:39:03.971 --> 01:39:06.541 region:rollup2
GRANULAR.

01:39:05.706 --> 01:39:09.010 region:rollup2
BUT I THINK THAT WE'RE GOING TO

01:39:06.541 --> 01:39:10.945 region:rollup2
CONTINUE TO TO FOLLOW POPULATION

01:39:09.010 --> 01:39:12.814 region:rollup2
MOVEMENTS AND DROUGHT AND THE

01:39:10.945 --> 01:39:16.417 region:rollup2
FUEL AND AND CONTINUE TO ADAPT

01:39:12.814 --> 01:39:18.586 region:rollup2
THEM -- SO I

01:39:16.417 --> 01:39:20.321 region:rollup2
I JUST I WISH I COULD SAY THAT

01:39:18.586 --> 01:39:22.190 region:rollup2
WE HAVE A PERFECT SYSTEM AND

01:39:20.321 --> 01:39:23.691 region:rollup2
IT'S JUST A MATTER OF OF MAKING

01:39:22.190 --> 01:39:25.693 region:rollup2
SURE THAT IT'S APPLIED I THINK

01:39:23.691 --> 01:39:27.962 region:rollup2
WE ARE CONSTANTLY.

01:39:25.693 --> 01:39:28.596 region:rollup2
GOING TO BE ADVANCING.

01:39:27.962 --> 01:39:31.432 region:rollup2
AND IMPROVING ON PAST PRACTICES

01:39:28.596 --> 01:39:33.067 region:rollup2
--

01:39:31.432 --> 01:39:34.802 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT --

01:39:33.067 --> 01:39:36.871 region:rollup2
THAT IT MAY BE THAT PERFECT

01:39:34.802 --> 01:39:37.472 region:rollup2
SAFETY AND THE AIR UP WHERE WERE

01:39:36.871 --> 01:39:40.641 region:rollup2
RD SEEING MORE FIRES MORE MORE

01:39:37.472 --> 01:39:42.977 region:rollup2
--

01:39:40.641 --> 01:39:44.579 region:rollup2
FEROCIOUS STORM FIRE START MORE

01:39:42.977 --> 01:39:46.447 region:rollup2
FEROCIOUS WINDS [inaudible]

01:39:44.579 --> 01:39:49.317 region:rollup2
DRIER SOILS.

01:39:46.447 --> 01:39:50.985 region:rollup2
AND DIE AND ALMOST NO HUMIDITY

01:39:49.317 --> 01:39:52.086 region:rollup2
DURING WIND EVENTS ALL

01:39:50.985 --> 01:39:54.755 region:rollup2
UNPRECEDENTED NORTHERN

01:39:52.086 --> 01:39:58.493 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA --

01:39:54.755 --> 01:40:00.461 region:rollup2
SAFETY JUST MADE NOT BE PERFECT.

01:39:58.493 --> 01:40:01.963 region:rollup2
AND SO PEOPLE NEED TO KNOW THAT

01:40:00.461 --> 01:40:03.731 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEY NEED TO UNDERSTAND

01:40:01.963 --> 01:40:05.766 region:rollup2
THAT THEY ARE AT RISK NO MATTER

01:40:03.731 --> 01:40:06.934 region:rollup2
HOW HARD WE WORK.

01:40:05.766 --> 01:40:08.169 region:rollup2
AS THE GOVERNOR SAID IN HIS

01:40:06.934 --> 01:40:09.570 region:rollup2
STATE OF THE STATE WE CAN'T

01:40:08.169 --> 01:40:10.805 region:rollup2
FIGHT NATURE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE

01:40:09.570 --> 01:40:12.340 region:rollup2
TO LEARN HOW. TO GET ALONG WITH

01:40:10.805 --> 01:40:15.476 region:rollup2
HER.

01:40:12.340 --> 01:40:18.546 region:rollup2
SO I THINK THAT MAY ACTUALLY IS

01:40:15.476 --> 01:40:20.348 region:rollup2
THE IS THE THE GOOD DOCTOR SAID

01:40:18.546 --> 01:40:22.216 region:rollup2
DUH MEAN RETHINKING WHERE AND

01:40:20.348 --> 01:40:24.919 region:rollup2
HOW DEVELOPMENT HAPPENS.

01:40:22.216 --> 01:40:27.521 region:rollup2
AND AND BUILDING STANDARDS --

01:40:24.919 --> 01:40:29.524 region:rollup2
IF IT CONTINUES TO TO EXPAND IN

01:40:27.521 --> 01:40:31.092 region:rollup2
THE URBAN WILDLAND IN.

01:40:29.524 --> 01:40:32.360 region:rollup2
FOR INTERFACING CURRENTLY HAVE

01:40:31.092 --> 01:40:33.628 region:rollup2
ABOUT FOUR MILLION PEOPLE WERE

01:40:32.360 --> 01:40:35.329 region:rollup2
LIVING IN THOSE FIRE HAZARD

01:40:33.628 --> 01:40:37.031 region:rollup2
AREAS EXPECTED TO GROW TO FIVE

01:40:35.329 --> 01:40:37.498 region:rollup2
MILLION.

01:40:37.031 --> 01:40:39.734 region:rollup2
WE WILL CONTINUE TO BE

01:40:37.498 --> 01:40:41.636 region:rollup2
CHALLENGED WHO WORK HARD WILL DO

01:40:39.734 --> 01:40:42.737 region:rollup2
OUR BEST.

01:40:41.636 --> 01:40:44.906 region:rollup2
BUT I WANT EVERYBODY TO

01:40:42.737 --> 01:40:45.406 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND THAT I DON'T THINK

01:40:44.906 --> 01:40:46.974 region:rollup2
WE'RE GOING TO DELIVER

01:40:45.406 --> 01:40:49.043 region:rollup2
PERFECTION THEIR WILL BE A

01:40:46.974 --> 01:40:51.178 region:rollup2
INCREMENTAL RISK SO LONG AS WE

01:40:49.043 --> 01:40:53.114 region:rollup2
CONTINUE TO INTERMINGLE BAR

01:40:51.178 --> 01:40:53.381 region:rollup2
URBAN DEVELOPMENT WITH A

01:40:53.114 --> 01:40:56.150 region:rollup2
WILDLAND.

01:40:53.381 --> 01:40:57.752 region:rollup2
INTERFACE.

01:40:56.150 --> 01:40:59.020 region:rollup2
SO I THINK COOLEY SAVANNAH MAY

01:40:57.752 --> 01:41:03.591 region:rollup2
HAVE SAID SOME THINGS TO ADD TO

01:40:59.020 --> 01:41:04.792 region:rollup2
MY COMMENTS.

01:41:03.591 --> 01:41:06.928 region:rollup2
GOOD AFTERNOON AND THANK YOU FOR

01:41:04.792 --> 01:41:07.795 region:rollup2
THE OPPORTUNITY TO US SPEAK HERE

01:41:06.928 --> 01:41:09.030 region:rollup2
TODAY.

01:41:07.795 --> 01:41:11.399 region:rollup2
I LEAD THE SAFETY AND

01:41:09.030 --> 01:41:12.600 region:rollup2
ENFORCEMENT PROGRAM AT THE CPUC

01:41:11.399 --> 01:41:15.703 region:rollup2
WHICH INCLUDES OVERSIGHT OF

01:41:12.600 --> 01:41:16.938 region:rollup2
UTILITY AND RAIL INFRASTRUCTURE.

01:41:15.703 --> 01:41:18.806 region:rollup2
THE OVERALL GROUP GOOD IS

01:41:16.938 --> 01:41:21.142 region:rollup2
COMPRISED OF ABOUT TWO HUNDRED

01:41:18.806 --> 01:41:22.276 region:rollup2
AND THIRTY STAFF ABOUT THIRTY

01:41:21.142 --> 01:41:24.211 region:rollup2
EIGHT OF THEM ARE IN THE

01:41:22.276 --> 01:41:25.613 region:rollup2
ELECTRIC AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS

01:41:24.211 --> 01:41:26.914 region:rollup2
SAFETY PROGRAM.

01:47:46.827 --> 01:47:49.763 region:rollup2
IN THE LIGHTING A FIRE.

01:47:48.295 --> 01:47:53.267 region:rollup2
OWE THE MAJORITY OF THESE ARE

01:47:49.763 --> 01:47:55.703 region:rollup2
MINOR.

01:47:53.267 --> 01:47:59.073 region:rollup2
FOR HELP BUT DOES THE TO GIVES A

01:47:55.703 --> 01:48:01.842 region:rollup2
SUPPORT INSIGHT AS TO WHAT'S --

01:47:59.073 --> 01:48:03.644 region:rollup2
DRIVES SO IGNITIONS.

01:48:01.842 --> 01:48:06.280 region:rollup2
AND IT CONSISTENTLY SHOWS THAT

01:48:03.644 --> 01:48:08.582 region:rollup2
THE NUMBER ONE CAUSE IS SO

01:48:06.280 --> 01:48:10.351 region:rollup2
VEGETATION O. FALLING INTO

01:48:08.582 --> 01:48:12.553 region:rollup2
UTILITY OF LINES.

01:48:10.351 --> 01:48:14.588 region:rollup2
SO THESE ARE SITUATIONS WHERE

01:48:12.553 --> 01:48:16.390 region:rollup2
OWE THE UTILITY FACILITIES ARE

01:48:14.588 --> 01:48:17.591 region:rollup2
NOT FEELING AS IN THE NATIONAL

01:48:16.390 --> 01:48:19.893 region:rollup2
STEP IT'S ACTUALLY JUST

01:48:17.591 --> 01:48:21.662 region:rollup2
VEGETATION THAT'S COMING AND

01:48:19.893 --> 01:48:23.397 region:rollup2
CONTACTS --

01:48:21.662 --> 01:48:26.233 region:rollup2
WITH THE LINES SO ABOUT A

01:48:23.397 --> 01:48:29.737 region:rollup2
QUARTER OF WHO AND HOME.

01:48:26.233 --> 01:48:32.573 region:rollup2
IGNITIONS ARE ATTRIBUTED SO TO

01:48:29.737 --> 01:48:34.475 region:rollup2
OF VEGETATION CONTACT OH IN

01:48:32.573 --> 01:48:35.642 region:rollup2
VARIOUS EARL SOMEWHERE Y.

01:48:34.475 --> 01:48:37.077 region:rollup2
TERRITORY WITH THE YOU ARE IN

01:48:35.642 --> 01:48:39.613 region:rollup2
THE NORTH OR THE SOUTH BOY

01:48:37.077 --> 01:48:42.950 region:rollup2
OVERALL OUT THAT TREND IS --

01:48:39.613 --> 01:48:44.852 region:rollup2
CONSISTENCE AND L. PART OF THE

01:48:42.950 --> 01:48:47.187 region:rollup2
CHALLENGE WHEN WE'RE LOOKING

01:48:44.852 --> 01:48:49.323 region:rollup2
ANTS OF EDUCATION MANAGEMENT

01:48:47.187 --> 01:48:50.991 region:rollup2
WHEN IT COMES --

01:48:49.323 --> 01:48:53.727 region:rollup2
TO ELECTRIC LINES FACILITIES AND

01:48:50.991 --> 01:48:57.331 region:rollup2
AGGRESSIONS IS BY --

01:48:53.727 --> 01:48:58.866 region:rollup2
ON THE WINDS OF FIFTEEN FIFTY

01:48:57.331 --> 01:48:59.800 region:rollup2
FIVE MILES PER HOUR YOU HOPE

01:48:58.866 --> 01:49:00.367 region:rollup2
HOLDS.

01:48:59.800 --> 01:49:03.170 region:rollup2
TREES AND BRANCHES OUT THAT

01:49:00.367 --> 01:49:04.405 region:rollup2
FAIL.

01:49:03.170 --> 01:49:05.339 region:rollup2
O. HOME SO THAT THAT WAS SO

01:49:04.405 --> 01:49:08.909 region:rollup2
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT BUDGET SEE

01:49:05.339 --> 01:49:10.210 region:rollup2
FROM THE OUTSIDE OVER UTILITY

01:49:08.909 --> 01:49:12.012 region:rollup2
CLEARANCE REQUIREMENTS.

01:49:10.210 --> 01:49:13.614 region:rollup2
ELM AND THAT'S ALSO GOES BEYOND

01:49:12.012 --> 01:49:15.315 region:rollup2
A JUST DEAD AND DISEASED TREES

01:49:13.614 --> 01:49:17.084 region:rollup2
THAT YOU'RE IDENTIFYING HOW

01:49:15.315 --> 01:49:18.819 region:rollup2
POTENTIALLY DURING PATROLS.

01:49:17.084 --> 01:49:20.020 region:rollup2
OMA SO.

01:49:18.819 --> 01:49:21.989 region:rollup2
NOW THAT JUST TO GIVE YOU A

01:49:20.020 --> 01:49:23.724 region:rollup2
SENSE OF THE SCOPE OF THE

01:49:21.989 --> 01:49:25.692 region:rollup2
CHALLENGE OH WOULD THAT WOULD

01:49:23.724 --> 01:49:27.761 region:rollup2
THAT DATE AND WHY WE SEEING.

01:49:25.692 --> 01:49:31.231 region:rollup2
HOME I THINK SUCH HIGH WELL

01:49:27.761 --> 01:49:32.533 region:rollup2
NUMBERS OF OF THE JUST THIESSEN

01:49:31.231 --> 01:49:35.235 region:rollup2
RELATED ADMISSIONS --

01:49:32.533 --> 01:49:37.104 region:rollup2
THE SECOND BILL LEADING BECAUSE

01:49:35.235 --> 01:49:40.307 region:rollup2
OVER CONDITIONS ACCORDING TO THE

01:49:37.104 --> 01:49:42.576 region:rollup2
STATE THAT IS SO WIRES DOWN.

01:49:40.307 --> 01:49:44.445 region:rollup2
HOME SO THAT'S THE CONDUCTORS

01:49:42.576 --> 01:49:47.047 region:rollup2
ARE COMING DOWN O. FROM THE

01:49:44.445 --> 01:49:48.148 region:rollup2
POLLS WERE FAILING L. AT THE

01:49:47.047 --> 01:49:51.418 region:rollup2
SPLICE.

01:49:48.148 --> 01:49:54.455 region:rollup2
HOME THAT ACCOUNTS ó FOR WELL

01:49:51.418 --> 01:49:56.924 region:rollup2
IT'S ABOUT TWENTY PERCENT'S HOME

01:49:54.455 --> 01:50:00.861 region:rollup2
OF ALL OF THE IGNITIONS REPORTED

01:49:56.924 --> 01:50:03.797 region:rollup2
BY THE UTILITIES --

01:50:00.861 --> 01:50:06.100 region:rollup2
THE YOU KNOW THE PIECE IS STAFF

01:50:03.797 --> 01:50:08.802 region:rollup2
FOCUSED ON AND IDENTIFYING BEST

01:50:06.100 --> 01:50:12.339 region:rollup2
PRACTICES AND SOLUTIONS TO

01:50:08.802 --> 01:50:13.407 region:rollup2
UTILITY THE AFIRE IGNITIONS AND

01:50:12.339 --> 01:50:14.508 region:rollup2
WELFARE PREVENTION [inaudible]

01:50:13.407 --> 01:50:16.777 region:rollup2
WELL.

01:50:14.508 --> 01:50:19.947 region:rollup2
I GROUP THESE POLICIES AND THREE

01:50:16.777 --> 01:50:21.882 region:rollup2
EL AREAS OF FIRES NEEDS SORT OF

01:50:19.947 --> 01:50:23.817 region:rollup2
THREE THINGS TO SPREAD SO.

01:50:21.882 --> 01:50:25.352 region:rollup2
NEED FUEL ó AND THAT MISSION

01:50:23.817 --> 01:50:27.621 region:rollup2
SOURCE AND SPECIFIC WEATHER

01:50:25.352 --> 01:50:29.857 region:rollup2
CONDITIONS ALSO FROM A POLICY

01:50:27.621 --> 01:50:31.558 region:rollup2
PERSPECTIVE WE CAN LOOK AT

01:50:29.857 --> 01:50:32.993 region:rollup2
THINGS TO DO WITH THE SO FUEL

01:50:31.558 --> 01:50:34.394 region:rollup2
REDUCTION.

01:50:32.993 --> 01:50:36.163 region:rollup2
SO IT'S ANYTHING FROM UTILITY

01:50:34.394 --> 01:50:38.999 region:rollup2
VEGETATION MANAGEMENT PROGRAM

01:50:36.163 --> 01:50:42.069 region:rollup2
BUT ALSO GOING BEYOND THAT IN

01:50:38.999 --> 01:50:44.338 region:rollup2
FIRE WAS WILLIAM FORESTS AND

01:50:42.069 --> 01:50:46.773 region:rollup2
MANAGING THE WILDLAND.

01:50:44.338 --> 01:50:49.309 region:rollup2
URBAN INTERFACE OF THE SECOND

01:50:46.773 --> 01:50:51.345 region:rollup2
SET OF POLICIES AROUND SO YOU

01:50:49.309 --> 01:50:52.913 region:rollup2
UTILITY INFRASTRUCTURES SOURCE

01:50:51.345 --> 01:50:54.414 region:rollup2
OF IGNITION SO THAT'S WHEN YOU

01:50:52.913 --> 01:50:56.016 region:rollup2
CAN LOOK AT HOME.

01:50:54.414 --> 01:50:58.218 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE HARDENING.

01:50:56.016 --> 01:51:00.254 region:rollup2
HOME SURGES GOING AFTER THE SORT

01:50:58.218 --> 01:51:01.722 region:rollup2
OF THE CORE THAT THE FIRST

01:51:00.254 --> 01:51:04.024 region:rollup2
PROBLEM ELM.

01:51:01.722 --> 01:51:05.859 region:rollup2
ALL OF WIRES DOWN OWE YOU CAN DO

01:51:04.024 --> 01:51:08.228 region:rollup2
THINGS TO STRENGTHEN ó A

01:51:05.859 --> 01:51:10.731 region:rollup2
CONDUCTORES AND INCREASE WAITED

01:51:08.228 --> 01:51:12.399 region:rollup2
WHAT EXPANSIVE THAT CAN IMPROVE

01:51:10.731 --> 01:51:14.868 region:rollup2
THE SAFETY OWN.

01:51:12.399 --> 01:51:16.970 region:rollup2
FACTORED WAY THOUGH ENSURING

01:51:14.868 --> 01:51:18.372 region:rollup2
THAT WIRES DO HOME BLOW INTO

01:51:16.970 --> 01:51:19.540 region:rollup2
EACH OTHER FOR EXAMPLE WHEN AND

01:51:18.372 --> 01:51:20.674 region:rollup2
HOW YOU HAVE HIGH WIND

01:51:19.540 --> 01:51:21.175 region:rollup2
CONDITIONS.

01:51:20.674 --> 01:51:24.678 region:rollup2
SO THOSE ARE SOME OF THE

01:51:21.175 --> 01:51:26.413 region:rollup2
EXAMPLES AROUND POLICIES ON AND

01:51:24.678 --> 01:51:28.982 region:rollup2
IGNITION PREVENTION HOME.

01:51:26.413 --> 01:51:31.752 region:rollup2
AND THEN THIRDLY IS THE WEATHER

01:51:28.982 --> 01:51:34.454 region:rollup2
AND THINGS THAT WE CAN DO --

01:51:31.752 --> 01:51:38.792 region:rollup2
TO BUILD A BETTER SEAT.

01:51:34.454 --> 01:51:39.593 region:rollup2
AND SEE GRANULAR CONDITIONS AT

01:51:38.792 --> 01:51:41.795 region:rollup2
THE POINTS WHERE THE

01:51:39.593 --> 01:51:43.864 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE AS WELL BECAUSE

01:51:41.795 --> 01:51:45.465 region:rollup2
WHEN WE FACING SUCH YOU YOU

01:51:43.864 --> 01:51:47.601 region:rollup2
LARGE SCALE CHALLENGE.

01:51:45.465 --> 01:51:49.636 region:rollup2
THAT WE HOW MILLIONS OF POLLS

01:51:47.601 --> 01:51:52.906 region:rollup2
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF LINES

01:51:49.636 --> 01:51:55.709 region:rollup2
OF CONDUCTORS OWE MORE THAN ó

01:51:52.906 --> 01:51:56.810 region:rollup2
44% OF LAND MASS IN HI FI OF

01:51:55.709 --> 01:51:58.645 region:rollup2
THREATS [inaudible]

01:51:56.810 --> 01:52:00.480 region:rollup2
HOME AREAS.

01:51:58.645 --> 01:52:02.482 region:rollup2
HOME WE HAVE TO GET A LOT MORE

01:52:00.480 --> 01:52:05.919 region:rollup2
GRANULAR AND IN TERMS OF OUR

01:52:02.482 --> 01:52:07.321 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDING OF WHERE NO WE SEE

01:52:05.919 --> 01:52:09.823 region:rollup2
THAT WE HAVE --

01:52:07.321 --> 01:52:12.492 region:rollup2
RISKS AND WHEN ANNA AND GET

01:52:09.823 --> 01:52:13.393 region:rollup2
SURGICAL AND AND OUR ABILITY TO

01:52:12.492 --> 01:52:14.928 region:rollup2
RESPOND --

01:52:13.393 --> 01:52:16.330 region:rollup2
SO THAT'S AN EXAMPLE OF THE

01:52:14.928 --> 01:52:18.765 region:rollup2
CAPABILITIES THAT WE CAN BE

01:52:16.330 --> 01:52:21.435 region:rollup2
BUILDING A HOME IN THE SORT OF

01:52:18.765 --> 01:52:22.803 region:rollup2
WEATHER ó RELIEF DID HEALTH

01:52:21.435 --> 01:52:24.638 region:rollup2
POLICIES --

01:52:22.803 --> 01:52:26.273 region:rollup2
SO SO.

LOOKING FOR A HOME BEST

01:52:45.025 --> 01:52:48.095 region:rollup2
PRACTICES TO PUT INTO PLACE TO

PREVENT --

01:52:48.095 --> 01:52:51.732 region:rollup2
FIRES FROM HAPPENING.

01:52:49.830 --> 01:52:54.468 region:rollup2
IN THE FUTURE EL THIS IS A TOP

01:52:51.732 --> 01:52:56.503 region:rollup2
PRIORITY HOLE FOR THE CPC.

01:52:54.468 --> 01:52:58.105 region:rollup2
A GOAL IS TO MAKE A TANGIBLE A

01:52:56.503 --> 01:53:00.340 region:rollup2
NOTICEABLE DIFFERENCE IN THE

01:52:58.105 --> 01:53:02.042 region:rollup2
AREAS THAT ARE MOST AT RISK OF

01:53:00.340 --> 01:53:03.977 region:rollup2
WILDFIRES --

01:53:02.042 --> 01:53:04.711 region:rollup2

YEAH.

01:53:04.711 --> 01:53:07.514 region:rollup2
BUT THIS IS GOES BEYOND THE PC

01:53:06.346 --> 01:53:10.083 region:rollup2
WILL HAVE A REALLY GOOD

HOW IF WE WORKED OVER THE LAST

02:05:05.732 --> 02:05:08.201 region:rollup2
DECADE TO BUILD?

02:05:07.100 --> 02:05:10.203 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT TO BUILD THIS

02:05:08.201 --> 02:05:12.038 region:rollup2
MITIGATION PROGRAM AND REALLY

02:05:10.203 --> 02:05:14.407 region:rollup2
HOW HAVE WE USED IT I'M NOT ONLY

02:05:12.038 --> 02:05:15.842 region:rollup2
IN DECEMBER BUT EVEN JUST A

02:05:14.407 --> 02:05:17.610 region:rollup2
COUPLE WEEKS AGO AS WE'RE

02:05:15.842 --> 02:05:19.612 region:rollup2
STARTING TO SEE EXTREME HEAT

02:05:17.610 --> 02:05:21.547 region:rollup2
WAVES -- AN

02:05:19.612 --> 02:05:23.683 region:rollup2
EXTREME FIRE POTENTIAL --

02:05:21.547 --> 02:05:25.818 region:rollup2
IMPART OF HOW THIS PROGRAM

02:05:23.683 --> 02:05:27.954 region:rollup2
STARTED WHO IS WAS GATHERING

02:05:25.818 --> 02:05:29.922 region:rollup2
WEATHER INFORMATION --

02:05:27.954 --> 02:05:31.924 region:rollup2
SO IN TWO THOUSAND TEN WE

02:05:29.922 --> 02:05:34.360 region:rollup2
EMBARKED ON AN EFFORT TO PUT A

02:05:31.924 --> 02:05:35.862 region:rollup2
WEATHER STATION ON EVERY.

02:05:34.360 --> 02:05:37.397 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE CIRCUITS THAT WE

02:05:35.862 --> 02:05:38.931 region:rollup2
OPERATE ACROSS OUR HIGHEST RISK

02:05:37.397 --> 02:05:41.501 region:rollup2
AREAS.

02:05:38.931 --> 02:05:43.603 region:rollup2
AND AND WE FOUND THAT THERE WAS

02:05:41.501 --> 02:05:45.538 region:rollup2
A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF

02:05:43.603 --> 02:05:46.973 region:rollup2
INFORMATION AND VALUE.

02:05:45.538 --> 02:05:48.608 region:rollup2
AND THAT HAS COME FROM THAT

02:05:46.973 --> 02:05:52.278 region:rollup2
NETWORK --

02:05:48.608 --> 02:05:54.147 region:rollup2
TODAY WE COLLECT TWO HUNDRED

02:05:52.278 --> 02:05:55.415 region:rollup2
THOUSAND PIECES OF WEATHER DATA

02:05:54.147 --> 02:05:57.784 region:rollup2
EVERY DAY AND IF YOU LOOK AT

02:05:55.415 --> 02:05:59.218 region:rollup2
THAT OVER THE COURSE OF A YEAR.

02:05:57.784 --> 02:06:00.720 region:rollup2
IT'S ALMOST A HUNDRED MILLION

02:05:59.218 --> 02:06:02.789 region:rollup2
AND OVER THE COURSE OF A DECADE

02:06:00.720 --> 02:06:04.357 region:rollup2
NOW WHERE APPROACHING A BILLION

02:06:02.789 --> 02:06:07.760 region:rollup2
PIECES OF WEATHER DATA SO IT'S

02:06:04.357 --> 02:06:10.196 region:rollup2
REALLY BECOMING A A BIG DATA --

02:06:07.760 --> 02:06:11.330 region:rollup2
WHETHER COLLECTION AND WE CAN DO

02:06:10.196 --> 02:06:14.934 region:rollup2
LOTS OF INFORMATION --

02:06:11.330 --> 02:06:16.636 region:rollup2
AND MAKE LOTS OF GOOD CHOICES

02:06:14.934 --> 02:06:19.105 region:rollup2
WITH A LOT OF THIS INFORMATION

02:06:16.636 --> 02:06:20.506 region:rollup2
ON SOME OF THOSE EIGHT GOES AND

02:06:19.105 --> 02:06:22.442 region:rollup2
NOT TO HELPING US BUILD TO

02:06:20.506 --> 02:06:23.943 region:rollup2
WEATHER MODELS.

02:06:22.442 --> 02:06:25.912 region:rollup2
BEING ABLE TO ANTICIPATE AND

02:06:23.943 --> 02:06:27.947 region:rollup2
PREPARE.

02:06:25.912 --> 02:06:29.615 region:rollup2
NOW FOR THESE EXTREME EVENTS

02:06:27.947 --> 02:06:31.350 region:rollup2
WHEN THEY'RE COMING THAT IS

02:06:29.615 --> 02:06:34.020 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT WE WE LOOK AT

02:06:31.350 --> 02:06:36.222 region:rollup2
VERY CLOSELY SO WE OPERATE A

02:06:34.020 --> 02:06:37.323 region:rollup2
MULTIPLE DATA SUPERCOMPUTERS IN

02:06:36.222 --> 02:06:40.359 region:rollup2
SAN DIEGO.

02:06:37.323 --> 02:06:41.527 region:rollup2
THAT TELL US EXACTLY HOW STRONG

02:06:40.359 --> 02:06:43.262 region:rollup2
WE THINK THE WINDS ARE GOING TO

02:06:41.527 --> 02:06:44.130 region:rollup2
BE AND EXACTLY WHERE THAT'S

02:06:43.262 --> 02:06:46.332 region:rollup2
GOING TO HAPPEN.

02:06:44.130 --> 02:06:48.501 region:rollup2
WE UPDATE THOSE MULTIPLE TIMES

02:06:46.332 --> 02:06:50.303 region:rollup2
EVERY DAY AND IT REALLY HELPS US

02:06:48.501 --> 02:06:52.405 region:rollup2
MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN I GET

02:06:50.303 --> 02:06:54.507 region:rollup2
CREWS AND RESOURCES IN THE RIGHT

02:06:52.405 --> 02:06:56.709 region:rollup2
PLACES -- AT

02:06:54.507 --> 02:06:58.644 region:rollup2
THE RIGHT TIME NOT IN ALL OF

02:06:56.709 --> 02:07:01.414 region:rollup2
THIS INFORMATION --

02:06:58.644 --> 02:07:01.948 region:rollup2
THEN ENDS UP BEING SHARED --

02:07:01.414 --> 02:07:03.049 region:rollup2
WITH THE NATIONAL WEATHER

02:07:01.948 --> 02:07:05.451 region:rollup2
SERVICE --

02:07:03.049 --> 02:07:07.053 region:rollup2
WITH THE FIRE AGENCIES IN AND

02:07:05.451 --> 02:07:09.255 region:rollup2
OTHER FOLKS SO A VERY VALUABLE

02:07:07.053 --> 02:07:11.424 region:rollup2
RESOURCE --

02:07:09.255 --> 02:07:11.724 region:rollup2
THAT WE HAVE DOWN IN SAN DIEGO

02:07:11.424 --> 02:07:15.595 region:rollup2
[inaudible]

02:07:11.724 --> 02:07:18.564 region:rollup2
AND ALL OF THIS INFORMATION ALSO

02:07:15.595 --> 02:07:19.198 region:rollup2
FEEDS INTO OUR TOOLS.

02:07:18.564 --> 02:07:21.334 region:rollup2
A BIG PART OF WHAT WE'VE NEEDED

02:07:19.198 --> 02:07:24.070 region:rollup2
--

02:07:21.334 --> 02:07:25.938 region:rollup2
TO OPERATE SAFELY AND RELIABLY

02:07:24.070 --> 02:07:26.539 region:rollup2
IT'S AN UNDERSTANDING OF A WHAT

02:07:25.938 --> 02:07:30.076 region:rollup2
IS THE FIRE POTENTIAL EVERYDAY

02:07:26.539 --> 02:07:30.643 region:rollup2
--

02:07:30.076 --> 02:07:31.711 region:rollup2
THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE

02:07:30.643 --> 02:07:32.879 region:rollup2
DAYS A YEAR.

02:07:31.711 --> 02:07:35.481 region:rollup2
SO WE DEVELOPED SOMETHING CALLED

02:07:32.879 --> 02:07:36.816 region:rollup2
THE FIRE POTENTIAL INDEX AND

02:07:35.481 --> 02:07:38.684 region:rollup2
WHAT IT IT WAS DEVELOPED BY

02:07:36.816 --> 02:07:39.118 region:rollup2
SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS WITHIN

02:07:38.684 --> 02:07:41.087 region:rollup2
THE UTILITY TEAM OF

02:07:39.118 --> 02:07:42.855 region:rollup2
FIREFIGHTERS.

02:07:41.087 --> 02:07:44.223 region:rollup2
AND A TEAM OF METEOROLOGISTS

02:07:42.855 --> 02:07:46.959 region:rollup2
WE'VE COME TOGETHER AND TRY TO

02:07:44.223 --> 02:07:50.329 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND WHAT DRIVES.

02:07:46.959 --> 02:07:51.864 region:rollup2
HIGH FIRE DANGER IN SAN DIEGO.

02:07:50.329 --> 02:07:53.699 region:rollup2
IN YOU CAN LOOK AND IT'S THAT

02:07:51.864 --> 02:07:54.800 region:rollup2
THE GRASS CROP IN THE AMOUNT OF

02:07:53.699 --> 02:07:56.102 region:rollup2
MOISTURE IN THE LIVE VEGETATION

02:07:54.800 --> 02:07:57.670 region:rollup2
AND THEN.

02:07:56.102 --> 02:07:59.338 region:rollup2
THE AMOUNT OF MOISTURE IN THE

02:07:57.670 --> 02:08:01.207 region:rollup2
DEAD FUELS AND THEN OF COURSE

02:07:59.338 --> 02:08:03.042 region:rollup2
THE WEATHER AND BY COMBINING ALL

02:08:01.207 --> 02:08:05.144 region:rollup2
OF THOSE.

02:08:03.042 --> 02:08:07.346 region:rollup2
INTO A SINGLE INDEX WE'VE BEEN

02:08:05.144 --> 02:08:09.048 region:rollup2
ABLE TO DEVELOP THAT I'VE THIS

02:08:07.346 --> 02:08:11.484 region:rollup2
ONE TOOL THAT THE FIRE POTENTIAL

02:08:09.048 --> 02:08:11.984 region:rollup2
INDEX AND OVER TIME IT HAS GROWN

02:08:11.484 --> 02:08:13.519 region:rollup2
OUTSIDE THE WALLS OF THE

02:08:11.984 --> 02:08:14.954 region:rollup2
UTILITY.

02:08:13.519 --> 02:08:16.222 region:rollup2
WE STARTED SHARING IT WITH THE

02:08:14.954 --> 02:08:18.124 region:rollup2
COUNTY OFFICE OF EMERGENCY

02:08:16.222 --> 02:08:19.859 region:rollup2
SERVICES AND THEN THE CITY

02:08:18.124 --> 02:08:22.028 region:rollup2
MANAGER'S AT ALL OF OUR LOCAL

02:08:19.859 --> 02:08:24.096 region:rollup2
CITIES AND THEN SAN DIEGO FIRE

02:08:22.028 --> 02:08:25.731 region:rollup2
AND RESCUE WE SEND IT TO CAL

02:08:24.096 --> 02:08:27.266 region:rollup2
FIRE EVERY DAY THROUGH OUR

02:08:25.731 --> 02:08:28.901 region:rollup2
PARTNERSHIPS.

02:08:27.266 --> 02:08:30.870 region:rollup2
I'VE DOWN IN SAN DIEGO.

02:08:28.901 --> 02:08:32.572 region:rollup2
TARA SO CERTAINLY A A VERY

02:08:30.870 --> 02:08:34.207 region:rollup2
VALUABLE --

02:08:32.572 --> 02:08:36.175 region:rollup2
TOOL AND SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN

02:08:34.207 --> 02:08:37.810 region:rollup2
VERY NECESSARY IN OUR SAFE

02:08:36.175 --> 02:08:40.446 region:rollup2
OPERATION --

02:08:37.810 --> 02:08:42.715 region:rollup2
DAY IN AND DAY OUT.

02:08:40.446 --> 02:08:44.517 region:rollup2
SOMETHING I HEARD EARLIER --

02:08:42.715 --> 02:08:45.985 region:rollup2
IN THIS HEARING WHICH I

02:08:44.517 --> 02:08:48.221 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY AGREED WITH WAS TAKE

02:08:45.985 --> 02:08:49.956 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT FIRE WEATHER IN

02:08:48.221 --> 02:08:52.858 region:rollup2
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND RELATING

02:08:49.956 --> 02:08:53.526 region:rollup2
IT TO WHAT A HURRICANE COULD BE.

02:08:52.858 --> 02:08:56.162 region:rollup2
OUR FOR THE SOUTHEASTERN PART OF

02:08:53.526 --> 02:08:58.297 region:rollup2
THE STATES.

02:08:56.162 --> 02:08:59.732 region:rollup2
AND BECAUSE OF THAT ONE THING

02:08:58.297 --> 02:09:01.234 region:rollup2
THAT THEY HAD IN THE

02:08:59.732 --> 02:09:03.502 region:rollup2
SOUTHEASTERN PART OF THE UNITED

02:09:01.234 --> 02:09:05.071 region:rollup2
STATES IS A RATING WHERE IF A

02:09:03.502 --> 02:09:06.439 region:rollup2
HURRICANE WAS COMING.

02:09:05.071 --> 02:09:08.140 region:rollup2
YOU KNEW THEY WOULD SELL YOU IF

02:09:06.439 --> 02:09:10.109 region:rollup2
IT WAS A CATEGORY ONE A CATEGORY

02:09:08.140 --> 02:09:12.178 region:rollup2
THREE CATEGORY.

02:09:10.109 --> 02:09:13.546 region:rollup2
FIVE LEADERSHIP THAT SDG ANY

02:09:12.178 --> 02:09:15.948 region:rollup2
CHALLENGED US ARE.

02:09:13.546 --> 02:09:18.451 region:rollup2
SEVERAL YEARS AGO TO DEVELOP A

02:09:15.948 --> 02:09:20.219 region:rollup2
RATING SYSTEM SIMILAR TO THAT.

02:09:18.451 --> 02:09:22.788 region:rollup2
AND OUT OF THAT PROJECT THE

02:09:20.219 --> 02:09:25.057 region:rollup2
SANTA ANA WILDFIRE THREAT INDEX

02:09:22.788 --> 02:09:26.459 region:rollup2
TOM WAS BORN AND IT'S NICE TO BE

02:09:25.057 --> 02:09:27.827 region:rollup2
NEXT TO CHIEF PORTER HERE

02:09:26.459 --> 02:09:28.894 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE WORKED VERY CLOSELY.

02:09:27.827 --> 02:09:31.330 region:rollup2
ON WITH HIS TEAM OF

02:09:28.894 --> 02:09:33.165 region:rollup2
METEOROLOGISTS AND RIVERSIDE AND

02:09:31.330 --> 02:09:36.602 region:rollup2
ALSO THE AND ATMOSPHERIC

02:09:33.165 --> 02:09:38.938 region:rollup2
SCIENCES DEPARTMENT AT UCLA AND

02:09:36.602 --> 02:09:40.473 region:rollup2
WE DEVELOPED THIS INDEX AND WHAT

02:09:38.938 --> 02:09:42.174 region:rollup2
IT DOES IS IT TELLS US.

02:09:40.473 --> 02:09:43.709 region:rollup2
ANA RATING FROM MARGINAL ALL THE

02:09:42.174 --> 02:09:45.444 region:rollup2
WAY TWO EXTREME WHAT IS THE FIRE

02:09:43.709 --> 02:09:46.979 region:rollup2
DANGER.

02:09:45.444 --> 02:09:48.948 region:rollup2
WITH THIS PARTICULAR SANTA ANA

02:09:46.979 --> 02:09:51.484 region:rollup2
WIND EVENT IN UNDERSTANDING THE

02:09:48.948 --> 02:09:51.951 region:rollup2
MAGNITUDE OF THAT RISK BECOMES

02:09:51.484 --> 02:09:54.453 region:rollup2
VERY CRITICAL TIME IN

02:09:51.951 --> 02:09:56.489 region:rollup2
MITIGATING.

02:09:54.453 --> 02:09:59.025 region:rollup2
AND THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH

02:09:56.489 --> 02:10:00.226 region:rollup2
THAT PARTICULAR SANTA ANA --

02:09:59.025 --> 02:10:03.029 region:rollup2
SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT IS

02:10:00.226 --> 02:10:06.098 region:rollup2
AVAILABLE ON TO ALL OF A

02:10:03.029 --> 02:10:06.966 region:rollup2
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA COVERS THE

02:10:06.098 --> 02:10:08.734 region:rollup2
SEVEN NINE SEVEN MAJOR COUNTIES

02:10:06.966 --> 02:10:09.769 region:rollup2
WE HAVE IN THE THE SOUTHERN PART

02:10:08.734 --> 02:10:11.804 region:rollup2
OF THE STATE.

02:10:09.769 --> 02:10:13.339 region:rollup2
AND ITS ISSUED BY --

02:10:11.804 --> 02:10:14.907 region:rollup2
THE UNITED STATES FOREST SERVICE

02:10:13.339 --> 02:10:15.675 region:rollup2
ARE PREDICTIVE SERVICES AND CAL

02:10:14.907 --> 02:10:17.376 region:rollup2
FIRE.

02:10:15.675 --> 02:10:20.212 region:rollup2
ON EVERYDAY.

02:10:17.376 --> 02:10:22.715 region:rollup2
SO GREAT TO HAVE A GREAT TOOL.

02:10:20.212 --> 02:10:24.583 region:rollup2
I'VE BUT OUR OUR ANALYTICS HAS

02:10:22.715 --> 02:10:26.719 region:rollup2
CONTINUED TO EVOLVE --

02:10:24.583 --> 02:10:28.587 region:rollup2
OVER THE YEARS AND A LOT OF WHAT

02:10:26.719 --> 02:10:29.221 region:rollup2
WE'RE LOOKING AT NOW --

02:10:28.587 --> 02:10:31.657 region:rollup2
BECOMES FIRE BEHAVIOR MODEL LIKE

02:10:29.221 --> 02:10:34.560 region:rollup2
--

02:10:31.657 --> 02:10:37.530 region:rollup2
IF A FIRE WHERE TO START --

02:10:34.560 --> 02:10:40.099 region:rollup2
EXACTLY WHERE WOULD IT GROW HOW

02:10:37.530 --> 02:10:41.233 region:rollup2
FAST CAN WE EXPECT TO GROW ON

02:10:40.099 --> 02:10:42.668 region:rollup2
AND WHAT COULD POTENTIALLY BE

02:10:41.233 --> 02:10:45.071 region:rollup2
AND ITS WAY.

02:10:42.668 --> 02:10:48.140 region:rollup2
AND HAVING THIS TECHNOLOGY AND

02:10:45.071 --> 02:10:50.209 region:rollup2
OPERATIONS IT'S BEEN REALLY THE

02:10:48.140 --> 02:10:53.579 region:rollup2
LEADING EDGE --

02:10:50.209 --> 02:10:55.314 region:rollup2
OF OUR TECHNOLOGY THESE DAYS AND

02:10:53.579 --> 02:10:57.183 region:rollup2
WITH SOME OF OUR BIG DATA --

02:10:55.314 --> 02:10:59.452 region:rollup2
WE ARE CURRENTLY --

02:10:57.183 --> 02:11:01.554 region:rollup2
SIMULATING OVER TEN MILLION

02:10:59.452 --> 02:11:03.356 region:rollup2
VIRTUAL WILDFIRES ACROSS SAN

02:11:01.554 --> 02:11:06.025 region:rollup2
DIEGO COUNTY AND WE'RE DOING

02:11:03.356 --> 02:11:08.294 region:rollup2
THAT AT EVERY SINGLE DAY.

02:11:06.025 --> 02:11:10.663 region:rollup2
AND THAT TELLS US EXACTLY WHERE

02:11:08.294 --> 02:11:10.963 region:rollup2
IF THEY FOUGHT IF A FIRE WERE TO

02:11:10.663 --> 02:11:12.698 region:rollup2
START HERE.

02:11:10.963 --> 02:11:14.567 region:rollup2
TODAY -- WE

02:11:12.698 --> 02:11:16.602 region:rollup2
HAVE BIG DATA AND ANALYTICS THAT

02:11:14.567 --> 02:11:18.637 region:rollup2
CAN TELL US WHERE IT WOULD GROW

02:11:16.602 --> 02:11:20.773 region:rollup2
AND AND THE AREA THAT IT COULD

02:11:18.637 --> 02:11:22.308 region:rollup2
ENCOMPASS AND THAT BECOMES

02:11:20.773 --> 02:11:25.611 region:rollup2
REALLY GOOD INTEL --

02:11:22.308 --> 02:11:27.146 region:rollup2
WHEN TRYING TO OPERATE SAFELY?

02:11:25.611 --> 02:11:28.914 region:rollup2
AND THEN AS RECENTLY AS JUST A

02:11:27.146 --> 02:11:31.383 region:rollup2
COUPLE WEEKS AGO AS WE START

02:11:28.914 --> 02:11:32.852 region:rollup2
SEEING SEVERAL FIRES BREAKING

02:11:31.383 --> 02:11:34.353 region:rollup2
OUT ACROSS SAN DIEGO.

02:11:32.852 --> 02:11:37.523 region:rollup2
YOU CAN SIMULATE YOU GET A

02:11:34.353 --> 02:11:39.258 region:rollup2
REALLY GOOD UNDERSTANDING OF IBM

02:11:37.523 --> 02:11:39.792 region:rollup2
IMMEDIATE THREAT.

02:11:39.258 --> 02:11:41.660 region:rollup2
POSTED BY SOME OF THESE A

02:11:39.792 --> 02:11:43.596 region:rollup2
CONNECTION.

02:11:41.660 --> 02:11:45.598 region:rollup2
ASA THESE ARE SOME SOME VERY

02:11:43.596 --> 02:11:46.465 region:rollup2
VALUABLE --

02:11:45.598 --> 02:11:48.768 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGY TOOLS AND

02:11:46.465 --> 02:11:49.301 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCEMENTS THAT

LEADING EDGE OF A LOT OF THE

02:11:53.606 --> 02:11:58.377 region:rollup2
FIRE SCIENCE IN ITS WHERE FIRE

02:11:55.541 --> 02:11:59.779 region:rollup2
SCIENCE IN BIG DATA MEET --

02:11:58.377 --> 02:12:01.313 region:rollup2
AND WE'RE REALLY TRYING TO

02:14:16.282 --> 02:14:20.252 region:rollup2
SERIOUSLY WE HAVE AN AWARD

02:14:17.950 --> 02:14:22.087 region:rollup2
WINNING VEGETATION MANAGEMENT

02:14:20.252 --> 02:14:22.721 region:rollup2
PROGRAM WE HAVE OVER FOUR

02:14:22.087 --> 02:14:24.423 region:rollup2
HUNDRED AND SIXTY THOUSAND TREES

02:14:22.721 --> 02:14:26.992 region:rollup2
--

02:14:24.423 --> 02:14:28.460 region:rollup2
WHICH ARE CURRENTLY LOGGED AND

02:14:26.992 --> 02:14:30.262 region:rollup2
INSPECTED EVERY YEAR.

02:14:28.460 --> 02:14:31.297 region:rollup2
ON AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT

02:14:30.262 --> 02:14:33.399 region:rollup2
EVEN THIS YEAR THERE HAVE BEEN

02:14:31.297 --> 02:14:36.635 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL ENHANCEMENTS.

02:14:33.399 --> 02:14:38.837 region:rollup2
ON TOP OF A HOBBY ALREADY A VERY

02:14:36.635 --> 02:14:40.272 region:rollup2
COMPREHENSIVE PROGRAM AND THAT

02:14:38.837 --> 02:14:41.307 region:rollup2
IS IN PLACE --

02:14:40.272 --> 02:14:43.842 region:rollup2
SO SOMETHING THAT WE'RE LOOKING

02:14:41.307 --> 02:14:45.711 region:rollup2
AT AND THEN SYSTEM HARDENING WE

02:14:43.842 --> 02:14:48.280 region:rollup2
WE'VE HEARD --

02:14:45.711 --> 02:14:49.915 region:rollup2
LIZA MENTIONING ABOUT --

02:14:48.280 --> 02:14:51.483 region:rollup2
HARDENING THE SYSTEM THERE'S

02:14:49.915 --> 02:14:54.253 region:rollup2
ALREADY BEEN OVER A BILLION

02:14:51.483 --> 02:14:56.822 region:rollup2
DOLLARS INVESTED IN SAN DIEGO IN

02:14:54.253 --> 02:14:58.290 region:rollup2
FIRE HARDENING THE SYSTEM.

02:14:56.822 --> 02:14:59.458 region:rollup2
I SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE

02:14:58.290 --> 02:15:01.427 region:rollup2
HEARD OF EARLIER IT'S A

02:14:59.458 --> 02:15:03.462 region:rollup2
CONVERTING WOULD POLLS TO STEAL

02:15:01.427 --> 02:15:04.863 region:rollup2
POLLS GETTING THINGS HIGHER OFF

02:15:03.462 --> 02:15:06.432 region:rollup2
THE GROUND SO IT'S LESS LIKELY

02:15:04.863 --> 02:15:07.099 region:rollup2
THAT THE DEBRIS THAT WE HEAR

02:15:06.432 --> 02:15:09.034 region:rollup2
ABOUT.

02:15:07.099 --> 02:15:09.702 region:rollup2
AYE IT'S LESS LIKELY THAT THE

02:15:09.034 --> 02:15:12.137 region:rollup2
DEBRIS IS GOING TO GET INTO THE

02:15:09.702 --> 02:15:14.606 region:rollup2
LINES MOVING LINES FURTHER APART

02:15:12.137 --> 02:15:16.842 region:rollup2
SO THAT THEY'RE LESS LIKELY.

02:15:14.606 --> 02:15:19.078 region:rollup2
TO I COME INTO CONTACT AND IT IS

02:15:16.842 --> 02:15:21.380 region:rollup2
A IT IS A HUGE --

02:15:19.078 --> 02:15:22.848 region:rollup2
HARDENING UNDERTAKING --

02:15:21.380 --> 02:15:24.016 region:rollup2
THROUGH ALL OF THIS BUT

02:15:22.848 --> 02:15:27.820 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT --

02:15:24.016 --> 02:15:30.155 region:rollup2
SDG ANY IS A IS VERY COMMITTED.

02:15:27.820 --> 02:15:31.223 region:rollup2
TO AND I WANTED --

02:15:30.155 --> 02:15:33.258 region:rollup2
TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT

02:15:31.223 --> 02:15:35.661 region:rollup2
RECENT EVENTS OUT BECAUSE AS WE

02:15:33.258 --> 02:15:36.562 region:rollup2
HEAR ABOUT CLIMATE SHIFTS IT IS

02:15:35.661 --> 02:15:38.764 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT WE'RE

02:15:36.562 --> 02:15:40.366 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCING A VERY MUCH SO IN

02:15:38.764 --> 02:15:41.767 region:rollup2
SAN DIEGO JUST LIKE THE REST OF

02:15:40.366 --> 02:15:42.768 region:rollup2
THE STATE AND THE RIGHT THE REST

02:15:41.767 --> 02:15:45.371 region:rollup2
OF THE WORLD.

02:15:42.768 --> 02:15:47.106 region:rollup2
AYE WE BROKE SOME ALL TIME HIGH

02:15:45.371 --> 02:15:48.474 region:rollup2
TEMPERATURES EARLIER THIS MONTH

02:15:47.106 --> 02:15:50.275 region:rollup2
ON JULY SIXTH.

02:15:48.474 --> 02:15:52.378 region:rollup2
ON SOME OF OUR COMMUNITIES NOT

02:15:50.275 --> 02:15:53.812 region:rollup2
TOO FAR FROM THE BEACH I WOULD

02:15:52.378 --> 02:15:54.480 region:rollup2
CONSIDER ARE FOOTHILLS WERE

02:15:53.812 --> 02:15:56.181 region:rollup2
APPROACHING A HUNDRED AND TWENTY

02:15:54.480 --> 02:15:57.950 region:rollup2
DEGREES.

02:15:56.181 --> 02:16:00.419 region:rollup2
AND THEY'D NEVER GONE HIGHER

02:15:57.950 --> 02:16:02.087 region:rollup2
THAN A HUNDRED ELEVEN BEFORE --

02:16:00.419 --> 02:16:04.957 region:rollup2
AND AT THE SAME TIME WE HAD

02:16:02.087 --> 02:16:06.592 region:rollup2
MULTIPLE WILD FIRES AND BREAKING

02:16:04.957 --> 02:16:08.594 region:rollup2
OUT ALL ACROSS.

02:16:06.592 --> 02:16:10.329 region:rollup2
AND SAN DIEGO COUNTY --

02:16:08.594 --> 02:16:12.598 region:rollup2
SO CERTAINLY A VERY

02:16:10.329 --> 02:16:13.298 region:rollup2
UNPRECEDENTED TYPE OF EVENT FOR

02:16:12.598 --> 02:16:13.599 region:rollup2
US IN THE MONTH OF JULY

02:16:13.298 --> 02:16:16.635 region:rollup2
[inaudible]

02:16:13.599 --> 02:16:18.437 region:rollup2
AND HISTORICALLY SPEAKING WE DO

02:16:16.635 --> 02:16:20.372 region:rollup2
SEE FIRES IN JULY USUALLY UP IN

02:16:18.437 --> 02:16:21.707 region:rollup2
THE MOUNTAINS AND AN AFTERNOON

02:16:20.372 --> 02:16:23.842 region:rollup2
SEA BREEZE BUT THIS IS A VERY

02:16:21.707 --> 02:16:26.378 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT EVENT --

02:16:23.842 --> 02:16:27.713 region:rollup2
THAT WE EXPERIENCED ON THEIR

02:16:26.378 --> 02:16:29.715 region:rollup2
WORST THREE OUTAGES ON OUR

02:16:27.713 --> 02:16:32.084 region:rollup2
SYSTEM ASSOCIATED WITH THIS

02:16:29.715 --> 02:16:32.551 region:rollup2
EVENT IN JULY ON NINE THAT THE

02:16:32.084 --> 02:16:35.254 region:rollup2
COMPANY PROACTIVELY DE

02:16:32.551 --> 02:16:36.955 region:rollup2
ENERGIZED.

02:16:35.254 --> 02:16:40.059 region:rollup2
AND THIS WAS THE TYPE OF EVENT

02:16:36.955 --> 02:16:42.294 region:rollup2
ON THAT WEEK END UP TURNING OFF

02:16:40.059 --> 02:16:43.996 region:rollup2
THE POWER ON ONE CIRCUIT NOT

02:16:42.294 --> 02:16:45.030 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THE FIREFIGHTERS ASKED

02:16:43.996 --> 02:16:46.298 region:rollup2
US.

02:16:45.030 --> 02:16:48.367 region:rollup2
TO OFFER SAFETY AND WE

02:16:46.298 --> 02:16:50.269 region:rollup2
COLLABORATE VERY CLOSELY WE HAVE

02:16:48.367 --> 02:16:51.703 region:rollup2
RETIRED FIREFIGHTERS THAT JOIN

02:16:50.269 --> 02:16:53.772 region:rollup2
INTO THE INCIDENT COMMAND ON THE

02:16:51.703 --> 02:16:55.174 region:rollup2
SYSTEM AND HOW WE WORK IN A

02:16:53.772 --> 02:16:57.376 region:rollup2
COLLABORATIVE EFFORT TO KEEP.

02:16:55.174 --> 02:16:59.078 region:rollup2
EVERYBODY SAFE --

02:16:57.376 --> 02:17:01.313 region:rollup2
DURING THESE TYPE OF EVENTS AND

02:16:59.078 --> 02:17:03.515 region:rollup2
THEN ALSO THE THE FIRE ITSELF ON

02:17:01.313 --> 02:17:04.650 region:rollup2
CAN CAUSE OUTAGES THROUGH THEIR

02:17:03.515 --> 02:17:05.484 region:rollup2
BURNING INTO THE SYSTEM SO

02:17:04.650 --> 02:17:07.486 region:rollup2
THAT'S THAT'S WHAT'S BEEN

02:17:05.484 --> 02:17:09.021 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCED --

02:17:07.486 --> 02:17:11.190 region:rollup2
EARLIER THIS MONTH.

02:17:09.021 --> 02:17:12.758 region:rollup2
AND THE AIR CRANE WHICH WE

02:17:11.190 --> 02:17:14.993 region:rollup2
TALKED ABOUT --

02:17:12.758 --> 02:17:17.830 region:rollup2
IS HAVING IT'S ON PACE TO BY FAR

02:17:14.993 --> 02:17:19.865 region:rollup2
HAVE A RECORD YEAR IN SAN DIEGO.

02:17:17.830 --> 02:17:21.967 region:rollup2
ON ONE FIRE LOAN EARLIER THIS

02:17:19.865 --> 02:17:23.135 region:rollup2
MONTH THAT DROPPED FIFTY

02:17:21.967 --> 02:17:25.537 region:rollup2
THOUSAND GALLONS OF WATER.

02:17:23.135 --> 02:17:27.539 region:rollup2
ARE JUST JUST SHY OF FIFTY

02:17:25.537 --> 02:17:29.241 region:rollup2
THOUSAND I SHOULD SAY.

02:17:27.539 --> 02:17:30.909 region:rollup2
AND SO FAR THIS YEAR WERE

02:17:29.241 --> 02:17:32.544 region:rollup2
APPROACHING A HUNDRED AND THIRTY

02:17:30.909 --> 02:17:34.446 region:rollup2
TWO THOUSAND GALLONS.

02:17:32.544 --> 02:17:36.081 region:rollup2
ON THAT THE UTILITY PALITANA

02:17:34.446 --> 02:17:38.550 region:rollup2
OCCUR.

02:17:36.081 --> 02:17:40.986 region:rollup2
HAS RIGHT NOW CONTRIBUTED TO THE

02:17:38.550 --> 02:17:42.721 region:rollup2
FIRE FIGHTING EFFORTS SO A VERY

02:17:40.986 --> 02:17:45.057 region:rollup2
VERY SIGNIFICANT I'M

02:17:42.721 --> 02:17:46.158 region:rollup2
CONTRIBUTION THERE.

02:17:45.057 --> 02:17:46.925 region:rollup2
WANTED.

02:17:46.158 --> 02:17:48.627 region:rollup2
TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT

02:17:46.925 --> 02:17:50.295 region:rollup2
DECEMBER.

02:17:48.627 --> 02:17:52.498 region:rollup2
AS WE'VE SPENT A DECADE

02:17:50.295 --> 02:17:53.732 region:rollup2
DEVELOPING A VERY COMPREHENSIVE

02:17:52.498 --> 02:17:54.466 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY FIRE SAFETY PROGRAM

02:17:53.732 --> 02:17:57.669 region:rollup2
THAT WAS [inaudible]

02:17:54.466 --> 02:17:59.772 region:rollup2
STRESSED IN DECEMBER WITH THE

02:17:57.669 --> 02:18:01.807 region:rollup2
MAGNITUDE OF THE EVENT THAT

02:17:59.772 --> 02:18:03.275 region:rollup2
IMPACTED SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA.

02:18:01.807 --> 02:18:04.510 region:rollup2
AND ULTIMATELY ONE OF THE

02:18:03.275 --> 02:18:05.944 region:rollup2
BENEFITS WE WERE ABLE TO

02:18:04.510 --> 02:18:06.712 region:rollup2
ANTICIPATE IT.

02:18:05.944 --> 02:18:09.348 region:rollup2
AND WE WERE ABLE TO SEE IT

02:18:06.712 --> 02:18:10.382 region:rollup2
COMING OUR MODELS TOLD A SEVEN

02:18:09.348 --> 02:18:13.018 region:rollup2
TO TEN DAYS OUT.

02:18:10.382 --> 02:18:14.853 region:rollup2
THAT THIS COULD BE I'M A TYPE OF

02:18:13.018 --> 02:18:16.488 region:rollup2
EVENT THAT COMES AROUND.

02:18:14.853 --> 02:18:18.257 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW IT'S HARD TO SAY IN OUR

02:18:16.488 --> 02:18:21.093 region:rollup2
IN WHAT IS NOW NORMAL --

02:18:18.257 --> 02:18:23.362 region:rollup2
BUT OF RARE EVENT WILL SAY ONCE

02:18:21.093 --> 02:18:24.963 region:rollup2
IN A TEN YEAR ONCE IN THE TWENTY

02:18:23.362 --> 02:18:26.632 region:rollup2
FIVE YEAR TYPE OF EVENT.

02:18:24.963 --> 02:18:28.967 region:rollup2
SO BEING ABLE TO SEE IT COMING

02:18:26.632 --> 02:18:30.936 region:rollup2
WE TOOK ALL PRECAUTIONS TO

02:18:28.967 --> 02:18:32.571 region:rollup2
MITIGATE THE RISK.

02:18:30.936 --> 02:18:34.406 region:rollup2
THAT WAS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT

02:18:32.571 --> 02:18:35.941 region:rollup2
I'VE YOU PUT SENSITIVE RELAYS ON

02:18:34.406 --> 02:18:37.209 region:rollup2
THE ELECTRIC SYSTEM.

02:18:35.941 --> 02:18:39.178 region:rollup2
YOU MAKE SURE THAT ALL RE

02:18:37.209 --> 02:18:40.913 region:rollup2
CLOSING IS TURNED OFF IN SOME

02:18:39.178 --> 02:18:42.714 region:rollup2
CASES ACROSS THE ENTIRE SYSTEM

02:18:40.913 --> 02:18:44.550 region:rollup2
ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THE BEACH.

02:18:42.714 --> 02:18:45.984 region:rollup2
AND YOU TAKE ALL THE STEPS TO

02:18:44.550 --> 02:18:47.119 region:rollup2
BEGIN TO MITIGATE THAT YOU WORK

02:18:45.984 --> 02:18:49.054 region:rollup2
WITH THE RED CROSS YOU WORK WITH

02:18:47.119 --> 02:18:51.223 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY LEADERS --

02:18:49.054 --> 02:18:53.659 region:rollup2
AND MAKE SURE THAT OUR CUSTOMERS

02:18:51.223 --> 02:18:55.394 region:rollup2
ARE AWARE OF WHAT'S --

02:18:53.659 --> 02:18:57.663 region:rollup2
WHAT'S POTENTIALLY COMING ABOUT

02:18:55.394 --> 02:18:59.097 region:rollup2
POTENTIALLY COULD HAPPEN --

02:18:57.663 --> 02:19:00.999 region:rollup2
BUT WHAT WE FOUND DURING THIS

02:18:59.097 --> 02:19:02.601 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR EVENT.

02:19:00.999 --> 02:19:05.370 region:rollup2
ON IS THAT THEIR WORD DE

02:19:02.601 --> 02:19:07.539 region:rollup2
ENERGIZED HAITIANS FOR SAFETY --

02:19:05.370 --> 02:19:09.141 region:rollup2
AND THAT BECOMES THE LAST RESORT

02:19:07.539 --> 02:19:10.375 region:rollup2
IT'S NEVER THE FOR THE FIRST

02:19:09.141 --> 02:19:12.344 region:rollup2
THING THAT YOU WOULD DO BUT WHEN

02:19:10.375 --> 02:19:14.112 region:rollup2
ALL OF THESE OTHER.

02:19:12.344 --> 02:19:15.714 region:rollup2
MITIGATION OF FAT AS THE FACTS

02:19:14.112 --> 02:19:17.916 region:rollup2
HAVE BEEN EXHAUSTED ARE BUT

02:19:15.714 --> 02:19:19.751 region:rollup2
THEY'RE STILL VERY SIGNIFICANT

02:19:17.916 --> 02:19:21.687 region:rollup2
SAFETY ISSUES THEN DE ENERGIZED

02:19:19.751 --> 02:19:23.622 region:rollup2
ATION --

02:19:21.687 --> 02:19:25.691 region:rollup2
BECOMES A REAL OPTION AND IN

02:19:23.622 --> 02:19:26.959 region:rollup2
THIS CASE YOU LOOK AT OTHER

02:19:25.691 --> 02:19:27.793 region:rollup2
THINGS LIKE WARNINGS.

02:19:26.959 --> 02:19:30.395 region:rollup2
ARE THERE RED FLAG WARNINGS IN A

02:19:27.793 --> 02:19:32.364 region:rollup2
FACT IS THAT THE SANTA ANA

02:19:30.395 --> 02:19:34.433 region:rollup2
WILDFIRE THREAD INDEX WHAT'S THE

02:19:32.364 --> 02:19:36.168 region:rollup2
RATING ON THAT --

02:19:34.433 --> 02:19:37.870 region:rollup2
OUR INTERNAL TOOLS LIKE THE FIRE

02:19:36.168 --> 02:19:39.104 region:rollup2
POTENTIAL INDEX IF ALL OF THOSE

02:19:37.870 --> 02:19:40.739 region:rollup2
ARE TELLING US THAT THIS IS AN

02:19:39.104 --> 02:19:42.541 region:rollup2
EXTREMELY RARE.

02:19:40.739 --> 02:19:44.042 region:rollup2
VERY HIGH RISK EVENT --

02:19:42.541 --> 02:19:46.545 region:rollup2
WE LOOK AT WEATHER CONDITIONS

02:19:44.042 --> 02:19:48.380 region:rollup2
FROM OUR WEATHER NETWORK --

02:19:46.545 --> 02:19:50.315 region:rollup2
WE'LL GET VEGETATION FUEL

02:19:48.380 --> 02:19:52.150 region:rollup2
CONDITIONS HOW MUCH OF WHAT IS

02:19:50.315 --> 02:19:53.352 region:rollup2
THE BURNING ENVIRONMENT FOR FIRE

02:19:52.150 --> 02:19:54.720 region:rollup2
GOES AND WILL IT GROW

02:19:53.352 --> 02:19:56.889 region:rollup2
EXPLOSIVELY.

02:19:54.720 --> 02:19:59.391 region:rollup2
ON AVAILABILITY OF FIREFIGHTING

02:19:56.889 --> 02:20:00.626 region:rollup2
RESOURCES IS IS A HUGE ONE IF

02:19:59.391 --> 02:20:02.794 region:rollup2
THERE ARE FIRES BURNING ALL OVER

02:20:00.626 --> 02:20:04.763 region:rollup2
THE STATE --

02:20:02.794 --> 02:20:06.198 region:rollup2
THAT BECOMES A BIG FACTOR AS

02:20:04.763 --> 02:20:09.601 region:rollup2
WELL AS WINS A LOT OF TYPES CAN

02:20:06.198 --> 02:20:12.004 region:rollup2
GROUND AND SO --

02:20:09.601 --> 02:20:14.406 region:rollup2
SO IF WE KNOW THAT IF A FIRE

02:20:12.004 --> 02:20:15.941 region:rollup2
WERE TO START ALL OF THE ARE ALL

02:20:14.406 --> 02:20:18.043 region:rollup2
OF THE AVIATION SUPPORT IS

02:20:15.941 --> 02:20:19.478 region:rollup2
GROUNDED THAT BECOMES A VERY BIG

02:20:18.043 --> 02:20:21.647 region:rollup2
FACTOR --

02:20:19.478 --> 02:20:22.881 region:rollup2
WHEN MAKING A DECISION LIKE THAT

02:20:21.647 --> 02:20:25.417 region:rollup2
AND THAT WAS EXACTLY WHAT WE

02:20:22.881 --> 02:20:27.185 region:rollup2
CAME INTO IN DECEMBER --

02:20:25.417 --> 02:20:28.954 region:rollup2
WE WERE.

02:20:27.185 --> 02:20:31.023 region:rollup2
MATTER WHICH DIRECTION WE LOOKED

02:20:28.954 --> 02:20:32.457 region:rollup2
IN SAN DIEGO THERE WAS SMOKE IN

02:20:31.023 --> 02:20:34.826 region:rollup2
THE SKY ALL AROUND US --

02:20:32.457 --> 02:20:37.562 region:rollup2
THE THOMAS FIRE HAD BEEN BURNING

02:20:34.826 --> 02:20:38.196 region:rollup2
AT AN EXPLOSIVE RATE --

02:20:37.562 --> 02:20:39.498 region:rollup2
FOR THE PREVIOUS EIGHTEEN HOURS

02:20:38.196 --> 02:20:41.500 region:rollup2
--

02:20:39.498 --> 02:20:43.635 region:rollup2
AND THERE WAS ALSO A LARGE FIRES

02:20:41.500 --> 02:20:46.071 region:rollup2
DOWN IN NORTHERN BAJA --

02:20:43.635 --> 02:20:47.606 region:rollup2
WHICH WE WHERE I TRACKING SO WE

02:20:46.071 --> 02:20:48.740 region:rollup2
WE AT THAT POINT HAD BEEN FULLY

02:20:47.606 --> 02:20:51.009 region:rollup2
SURROUNDED AND WE'RE EXPECTING

02:20:48.740 --> 02:20:52.244 region:rollup2
WINDS OF SIXTY TO NINETY MILES

02:20:51.009 --> 02:20:54.046 region:rollup2
AN HOUR --

02:20:52.244 --> 02:20:55.580 region:rollup2
ACROSS OUR BACK COUNTRY IN OUR

02:20:54.046 --> 02:20:57.449 region:rollup2
WEATHER NETWORK STARTED TO

02:20:55.580 --> 02:20:59.384 region:rollup2
CAPTURE THAT WE ACTUALLY SAW

02:20:57.449 --> 02:21:00.585 region:rollup2
WINDS ARE UP TO EIGHTY SEVEN

02:20:59.384 --> 02:21:02.220 region:rollup2
MILES AN HOUR IN THE BACK

02:21:00.585 --> 02:21:03.522 region:rollup2
COUNTRY OF SAN DIEGO UNDER THOSE

02:21:02.220 --> 02:21:05.257 region:rollup2
CONDITIONS.

02:21:03.522 --> 02:21:06.024 region:rollup2
I'M SO WAS EXTREMELY CRITICAL

02:21:05.257 --> 02:21:08.760 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S WHEN WE DID TAKE

02:21:06.024 --> 02:21:10.195 region:rollup2
THOSE STEPS --

02:21:08.760 --> 02:21:14.266 region:rollup2
TO DE ENERGIZED FOR FOR THE

02:21:10.195 --> 02:21:15.267 region:rollup2
SAFETY OF THE PUBLIC --

02:21:14.266 --> 02:21:17.035 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE BIG PIECES OF

02:21:15.267 --> 02:21:18.937 region:rollup2
FEEDBACK THAT WE GOT AS AS SOON

02:21:17.035 --> 02:21:20.772 region:rollup2
AS THE WINDS COME DOWN.

02:21:18.937 --> 02:21:22.474 region:rollup2
EVERYONE SAYS OKAY LET'S LET'S

02:21:20.772 --> 02:21:24.476 region:rollup2
TURN IT RIGHT BACK ON BUT RE

02:21:22.474 --> 02:21:26.178 region:rollup2
ENERGIZING AYE IS A VERY LARGE

02:21:24.476 --> 02:21:28.513 region:rollup2
EFFORT.

02:21:26.178 --> 02:21:30.248 region:rollup2
I FOR A COUPLE REASONS WHEN THE

02:21:28.513 --> 02:21:32.317 region:rollup2
SYSTEM IS DE ENERGIZED THERE

02:21:30.248 --> 02:21:33.685 region:rollup2
COULD BE TREE LIMBS UNDER WIND

02:21:32.317 --> 02:21:34.853 region:rollup2
CONDITIONS OF NINETY MILES AN

02:21:33.685 --> 02:21:36.388 region:rollup2
HOUR THEIR COULD BE TREE LIMBS

02:21:34.853 --> 02:21:38.657 region:rollup2
FROM HALF A MILE AWAY.

02:21:36.388 --> 02:21:40.759 region:rollup2
THAT ARE IN THE LINE --

02:21:38.657 --> 02:21:41.793 region:rollup2
SO AT THAT POINT WE HAVE TO

02:21:40.759 --> 02:21:43.862 region:rollup2
MONITOR.

02:21:41.793 --> 02:21:45.163 region:rollup2
THE ENTIRE LINE INCH BY INCH AND

02:21:43.862 --> 02:21:46.431 region:rollup2
LOOK AT IT AND MAKE SURE THAT

02:21:45.163 --> 02:21:48.300 region:rollup2
THERE IS NOTHING IN.

02:21:46.431 --> 02:21:49.935 region:rollup2
IN THE LINES ITSELF AND THIS IS

02:21:48.300 --> 02:21:51.336 region:rollup2
AFTER THE WINDS HAVE DROPPED LOW

02:21:49.935 --> 02:21:53.171 region:rollup2
ENOUGH THAT WE'RE CONFIDENT

02:21:51.336 --> 02:21:55.040 region:rollup2
NOTHING ELSE IS GOING. TO TO

02:21:53.171 --> 02:21:56.241 region:rollup2
BLOW INTO THE LINES SOME OF

02:21:55.040 --> 02:21:57.209 region:rollup2
THESE HAVE TO BE DONE BY

02:21:56.241 --> 02:21:58.310 region:rollup2
HELICOPTER.

02:21:57.209 --> 02:22:01.146 region:rollup2
AYE IN THE SAFETY OF THE PILOTS

02:21:58.310 --> 02:22:02.681 region:rollup2
OF COURSES PARAMOUNT.

02:22:01.146 --> 02:22:04.082 region:rollup2
AND SO EVEN AS THE WINDS IN A

02:22:02.681 --> 02:22:05.317 region:rollup2
SANTA ANA DECREASE RIGHT THERE

02:22:04.082 --> 02:22:06.852 region:rollup2
AT THE SURFACE THEY GET UP IN A

02:22:05.317 --> 02:22:08.453 region:rollup2
HELICOPTER AND THEY SAY IT'S

02:22:06.852 --> 02:22:10.389 region:rollup2
STILL REALLY WINDY APPEAR.

02:22:08.453 --> 02:22:12.324 region:rollup2
NAM SO WE HAVE TO WAIT FOR

02:22:10.389 --> 02:22:14.393 region:rollup2
REALLY THE WHOLE EVENT. TO COME

02:22:12.324 --> 02:22:16.928 region:rollup2
TO AN END AS WE START PATROLLING

02:22:14.393 --> 02:22:18.163 region:rollup2
AND IN SOME CASES --

02:22:16.928 --> 02:22:20.699 region:rollup2
WERE PATROLLING HUNDREDS IF NOT

02:22:18.163 --> 02:22:22.334 region:rollup2
THOUSANDS OF MILES --

02:22:20.699 --> 02:22:24.403 region:rollup2
OF LINES TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY

02:22:22.334 --> 02:22:26.038 region:rollup2
ARE CLEAR AND SAFE AND READY TO

02:22:24.403 --> 02:22:28.306 region:rollup2
BE RE ENERGIZED SO THESE ARE

02:22:26.038 --> 02:22:31.176 region:rollup2
SOME MAJOR FACTORS --

02:22:28.306 --> 02:22:33.011 region:rollup2
THAT WE LOOK AT AGAIN I REALLY

02:22:31.176 --> 02:22:35.080 region:rollup2
APPRECIATE YOUR TIME AND HAVING

02:22:33.011 --> 02:22:36.615 region:rollup2
THE OPPORTUNITY TO TO TALK ABOUT

02:22:35.080 --> 02:22:37.616 region:rollup2
THIS AND LOOK FORWARD IF THERE

02:22:36.615 --> 02:22:39.184 region:rollup2
ARE ANY FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS

02:22:37.616 --> 02:22:41.620 region:rollup2
THANK YOU.

02:22:39.184 --> 02:22:43.055 region:rollup2
THANK YOU AND WE DO APPRECIATE A

02:22:41.620 --> 02:22:44.790 region:rollup2
NOT ONLY ARE PRESENTATION IT WAS

02:22:43.055 --> 02:22:46.358 region:rollup2
VERY ENLIGHTENING IN TERMS OF

02:22:44.790 --> 02:22:49.094 region:rollup2
WHAT --

02:22:46.358 --> 02:22:50.962 region:rollup2
YOU'RE TAKING THE TECHNOLOGY AND

02:22:49.094 --> 02:22:53.799 region:rollup2
AND KIND OF LOOKING AT WHAT WAS

02:22:50.962 --> 02:22:54.366 region:rollup2
DESCRIBED EARLIER ABOUT PC AND

02:22:53.799 --> 02:22:56.401 region:rollup2
AS WEATHERIZATION ISSUES AND

02:22:54.366 --> 02:22:57.736 region:rollup2
HOW.

02:22:56.401 --> 02:22:59.271 region:rollup2
TO A GIVE US MORE INFORMATION TO

02:22:57.736 --> 02:23:00.539 region:rollup2
BE IN A STRONGER POSITION SO I

02:22:59.271 --> 02:23:01.706 region:rollup2
THINK THAT'S VERY HELPFUL I'M

02:23:00.539 --> 02:23:04.009 region:rollup2
GONNA HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO

02:23:01.706 --> 02:23:05.343 region:rollup2
TOUR THE FACILITY ON FRIDAY SO

02:23:04.009 --> 02:23:06.578 region:rollup2
IT ENCOURAGES.

02:23:05.343 --> 02:23:07.646 region:rollup2
ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE PANEL

02:23:06.578 --> 02:23:10.015 region:rollup2
THAT SOME POINT.

02:23:07.646 --> 02:23:10.949 region:rollup2
A TO MAKE THEMSELVES AVAILABLE

02:23:10.015 --> 02:23:13.318 region:rollup2
TO DO SO AS WELL.

02:23:10.949 --> 02:23:16.788 region:rollup2
ARE I'D LIKE.

02:23:13.318 --> 02:23:18.790 region:rollup2
TO ASK A QUESTION OR TWO OF YOU

02:23:16.788 --> 02:23:20.559 region:rollup2
MISTER PICKER AND THEN WE'LL

02:23:18.790 --> 02:23:22.160 region:rollup2
TURN TO OTHER MEMBERS.

02:23:20.559 --> 02:23:23.728 region:rollup2
TO EXPLORE QUESTIONS AND THEN

02:23:22.160 --> 02:23:25.864 region:rollup2
WE'LL GO TO THE PUBLIC.

02:23:23.728 --> 02:23:30.335 region:rollup2
THERE YOU'D MENTIONED THERE ARE

02:23:25.864 --> 02:23:31.770 region:rollup2
BEING THE A SAFETY STANDARDS.

02:23:30.335 --> 02:23:33.705 region:rollup2
AS A RELATED TO SAFETY STANDARDS

02:23:31.770 --> 02:23:36.475 region:rollup2
WERE A MORE TYPICALLY BASED ON

02:23:33.705 --> 02:23:38.910 region:rollup2
FUNDING --

02:23:36.475 --> 02:23:41.413 region:rollup2
RATHER THAN ON WHAT WAS

02:23:38.910 --> 02:23:43.849 region:rollup2
NECESSARY FOR SAFETY OR MAYBE

02:23:41.413 --> 02:23:45.117 region:rollup2
YOU CAN CORRECT ME ON ON THAT

02:23:43.849 --> 02:23:46.418 region:rollup2
POINT BUT I BUT I GUESS IF THE

02:23:45.117 --> 02:23:47.752 region:rollup2
PART THAT WE REALLY WANT TO GET

02:23:46.418 --> 02:23:49.454 region:rollup2
TO IS.

02:23:47.752 --> 02:23:51.189 region:rollup2
DO YOU BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE

02:23:49.454 --> 02:23:52.724 region:rollup2
OTHER ENTITIES THAT ARE MORE.

02:23:51.189 --> 02:23:56.528 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATE TO MAYBE LOOK AT

02:23:52.724 --> 02:23:57.996 region:rollup2
SETTING THESE SAFETY STANDARDS.

02:23:56.528 --> 02:24:00.599 region:rollup2
I I THINK ABOUT THAT A LOT.

02:23:57.996 --> 02:24:02.601 region:rollup2
OF BUT OUR OBLIGATION IS TO HAVE

02:24:00.599 --> 02:24:04.769 region:rollup2
SORT OF A LEGALISTIC FRAMEWORK

02:24:02.601 --> 02:24:07.172 region:rollup2
IT'S ALMOST LIKE A COURT IS

02:24:04.769 --> 02:24:09.474 region:rollup2
SIMILAR TO THE ADMIRALTY COURTS

02:24:07.172 --> 02:24:13.378 region:rollup2
WORD THEM WHEN WE AUTHORIZE

02:24:09.474 --> 02:24:15.280 region:rollup2
EXPENDITURES A. COMES. FOR THE

02:24:13.378 --> 02:24:16.481 region:rollup2
JUDGE WHO ALLOWS PEOPLE TO

02:24:15.280 --> 02:24:17.849 region:rollup2
DECLARE THAT THEIR PARTIES IN

02:24:16.481 --> 02:24:19.351 region:rollup2
THAT PROCEEDING AND THEY CAN

02:24:17.849 --> 02:24:21.453 region:rollup2
CHALLENGE.

02:24:19.351 --> 02:24:22.154 region:rollup2
THE UTILITIES ASSERTIONS ABOUT

02:24:21.453 --> 02:24:24.389 region:rollup2
WHAT WOULD BE SUITABLE

02:24:22.154 --> 02:24:26.124 region:rollup2
EXPENDITURES.

02:24:24.389 --> 02:24:26.992 region:rollup2
AND THEN WE HAVE TO MAKE A

02:24:26.124 --> 02:24:28.927 region:rollup2
DECISION THIS BASED ON THE

02:24:26.992 --> 02:24:30.829 region:rollup2
RECORD SO DEPENDING UPON HOW

02:24:28.927 --> 02:24:32.397 region:rollup2
WELL THE UTILITY CAN MAKE THEIR

02:24:30.829 --> 02:24:33.965 region:rollup2
ARGUMENTS ABOUT WHETHER AN

02:24:32.397 --> 02:24:35.800 region:rollup2
EXPENDITURE IS REASONABLE AND

02:24:33.965 --> 02:24:37.402 region:rollup2
JUST.

02:24:35.800 --> 02:24:39.104 region:rollup2
AND THE EVIDENCE THAT'S

02:24:37.402 --> 02:24:41.306 region:rollup2
PRESENTED BY PARTIES.

02:24:39.104 --> 02:24:43.375 region:rollup2
I HOPE WE SOMETIMES DON'T HAVE

02:24:41.306 --> 02:24:44.843 region:rollup2
THE RECORD TO MAKE A FINE THEN

02:24:43.375 --> 02:24:46.578 region:rollup2
EXPENDITURES NECESSARY.

02:24:44.843 --> 02:24:48.547 region:rollup2
HERE IN PART BECAUSE WE COULD

02:24:46.578 --> 02:24:49.881 region:rollup2
RELY ON THE EFFORTS OF

02:24:48.547 --> 02:24:51.383 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA.

02:24:49.881 --> 02:24:53.552 region:rollup2
AND ARE PROCEEDING AROUND

02:24:51.383 --> 02:24:54.853 region:rollup2
VEGETATION MANAGEMENT WE DID NOT

02:24:53.552 --> 02:24:55.787 region:rollup2
ACCEPT THE ARGUMENT FOR THEIR

02:24:54.853 --> 02:24:58.223 region:rollup2
WORK FROM THE RATE PAYER

02:24:55.787 --> 02:24:59.925 region:rollup2
ADVOCATES THAT THE EXPENDITURES

02:24:58.223 --> 02:25:00.759 region:rollup2
THE NEW EXPENDITURES FOR IT AND

02:24:59.925 --> 02:25:03.695 region:rollup2
MORE.

02:25:00.759 --> 02:25:04.696 region:rollup2
EXPANDED DIVERT PROGRAM WERE

02:25:03.695 --> 02:25:06.898 region:rollup2
INAPPROPRIATE WE FOUND THAT THEY

02:25:04.696 --> 02:25:08.466 region:rollup2
WERE FROM.

02:25:06.898 --> 02:25:09.801 region:rollup2
SO WE'VE BEEN ORDERED THIS THIS

02:25:08.466 --> 02:25:12.404 region:rollup2
PAST IN THE COUNTRY [inaudible]

02:25:09.801 --> 02:25:15.340 region:rollup2
SENATE PRACTICES [inaudible]

02:25:12.404 --> 02:25:17.375 region:rollup2
IN THE WHO DO YOU CONSIDER

02:25:15.340 --> 02:25:20.679 region:rollup2
THEY'RE BEING AN OPPORTUNITY OR

02:25:17.375 --> 02:25:22.914 region:rollup2
NEED FOR THIS SAFETY STANDARDS.

02:25:20.679 --> 02:25:24.249 region:rollup2
THEY COULD BE SAID BY.

02:25:22.914 --> 02:25:26.051 region:rollup2
A DIFFERENT ENTITY BID THEN

02:25:24.249 --> 02:25:28.019 region:rollup2
CLOSE THE P. YOU SEE MORE IN A

02:25:26.051 --> 02:25:29.387 region:rollup2
POSITION OF IMPLEMENTATION SO

02:25:28.019 --> 02:25:32.490 region:rollup2
I'M ALWAYS LOOKING FOR BEST

02:25:29.387 --> 02:25:35.560 region:rollup2
PRACTICES AND SO WOULD EXAMPLE.

02:25:32.490 --> 02:25:37.128 region:rollup2
WHAT I'VE SEEN ELSEWHERE IS FOR

02:25:35.560 --> 02:25:40.231 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE A NUCLEAR SAFETY?

02:25:37.128 --> 02:25:41.433 region:rollup2
WE DON'T CHALLENGE THE FINDINGS

02:25:40.231 --> 02:25:43.235 region:rollup2
TO THE NRC.

02:25:41.433 --> 02:25:45.070 region:rollup2
THEY SAID A SAFETY STANDARD AND

02:25:43.235 --> 02:25:46.571 region:rollup2
THEN THE UTILITIES BRING FORWARD

02:25:45.070 --> 02:25:48.039 region:rollup2
THEIR COST ESTIMATES WILL LOOK

02:25:46.571 --> 02:25:49.407 region:rollup2
AT COST ESTIMATES TO MAKE SURE

02:25:48.039 --> 02:25:50.775 region:rollup2
THEY'RE REASONABLE BUT WE DON'T

02:25:49.407 --> 02:25:52.677 region:rollup2
CHALLENGE THE STANDARD WE DON'T

02:25:50.775 --> 02:25:55.847 region:rollup2
SET.

02:25:52.677 --> 02:25:57.282 region:rollup2
SNOW HERE WE BECAUSE WE THOUGHT

02:25:55.847 --> 02:25:58.850 region:rollup2
IT WAS NECESSARY BECAUSE IT'S

02:25:57.282 --> 02:26:01.453 region:rollup2
IT'S CURRENTLY OUR DUTY TO DO

02:25:58.850 --> 02:26:02.921 region:rollup2
THAT WE WE WORK WITH CAL FIRE TO

02:26:01.453 --> 02:26:04.589 region:rollup2
COME UP WITH --

02:26:02.921 --> 02:26:07.492 region:rollup2
A VEHICLE TO DO THAT AND SO

02:26:04.589 --> 02:26:09.861 region:rollup2
UNTIL THERE'S MAYBE A STATEWIDE

02:26:07.492 --> 02:26:12.230 region:rollup2
SAFETY AGENCY THAT DEALS WITH

02:26:09.861 --> 02:26:13.832 region:rollup2
ALL KINDS OF SAFETY RISKS AND

02:26:12.230 --> 02:26:16.201 region:rollup2
PUTS FORWARD STANDARDS.

02:26:13.832 --> 02:26:17.969 region:rollup2
IT'LL ALWAYS FALL TO US TO TO DO

02:26:16.201 --> 02:26:20.005 region:rollup2
THE SINKS WITHIN OUR EXISTING

02:26:17.969 --> 02:26:20.839 region:rollup2
SETTING --

02:26:20.005 --> 02:26:22.807 region:rollup2
SO.

02:26:20.839 --> 02:26:24.809 region:rollup2
A CHALLENGES ALWAYS OF COURSE

02:26:22.807 --> 02:26:27.112 region:rollup2
THAT WHEN WE DO THINGS

02:26:24.809 --> 02:26:29.114 region:rollup2
INDEPENDENT OF OTHER AGENCIES WE

02:26:27.112 --> 02:26:30.315 region:rollup2
CAN SET A DIFFERENT STANDARD OR

02:26:29.114 --> 02:26:32.150 region:rollup2
WE CAN UNDERCUT.

02:26:30.315 --> 02:26:35.020 region:rollup2
OR OTHER AGENCIES CAN UNDERCUT

02:26:32.150 --> 02:26:36.721 region:rollup2
WHAT WE COME UP WITH SO IT'S IT

02:26:35.020 --> 02:26:38.857 region:rollup2
REQUIRES US TO BE VERY NOBLE.

02:26:36.721 --> 02:26:40.492 region:rollup2
AND TO WORK VERY CAREFULLY

02:26:38.857 --> 02:26:42.193 region:rollup2
FEATHER OUTSIDE AGENCIES.

02:26:40.492 --> 02:26:44.596 region:rollup2
BUT EVEN THERE I THINK THAT THAT

02:26:42.193 --> 02:26:46.598 region:rollup2
YOU WILL KIND OF GET PEOPLE KIND

02:26:44.596 --> 02:26:48.066 region:rollup2
OF SHOPPING FOR THE JURISDICTION

02:26:46.598 --> 02:26:52.203 region:rollup2
TO FIGHT OVER WHETHER SOMETHING

02:26:48.066 --> 02:26:54.572 region:rollup2
IS REASONABLE WE AND EFFECTIVE.

02:26:52.203 --> 02:26:56.708 region:rollup2
AND WHETHER THE EXPENDITURE IS

02:26:54.572 --> 02:26:58.910 region:rollup2
IS IS NECESSARY.

02:26:56.708 --> 02:27:00.278 region:rollup2
WOULD YOU RECOMMEND.

02:26:58.910 --> 02:27:01.946 region:rollup2
SUCH A STATEWIDE AGENCY BE

02:27:00.278 --> 02:27:03.682 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBLE ENOUGH TO FIND A

02:27:01.946 --> 02:27:05.917 region:rollup2
CERTAIN WAY.

02:27:03.682 --> 02:27:07.152 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT THAT IF YOU START

02:27:05.917 --> 02:27:08.553 region:rollup2
DOWN THAT PATH YOU HAVE TO LOOK

02:27:07.152 --> 02:27:10.922 region:rollup2
AT ALL THE OTHER INDEPENDENT

02:27:08.553 --> 02:27:12.557 region:rollup2
AGENCIES WHO HAVE DEEP EXPERTISE

02:27:10.922 --> 02:27:14.292 region:rollup2
IN OTHER KINDS OF INDUSTRIES AND

02:27:12.557 --> 02:27:16.728 region:rollup2
OTHER KIND OF BEHAVIORS RANGING

02:27:14.292 --> 02:27:20.465 region:rollup2
FROM WATER QUALITY TO THESE

02:27:16.728 --> 02:27:22.133 region:rollup2
TOXICS TO ON HIGHWAY SAFETY.

02:27:20.465 --> 02:27:23.868 region:rollup2
SO I THINK IT'S ROBABLY

02:27:22.133 --> 02:27:26.404 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT NEEDS A WHOLE LOT

02:27:23.868 --> 02:27:27.972 region:rollup2
OF THOUGHT I TALK A LOT WITH MY

02:27:26.404 --> 02:27:28.506 region:rollup2
COLLEAGUES HERE TO WE ASK

02:27:27.972 --> 02:27:30.742 region:rollup2
HELLFIRE ABOUT HOW WE GET

02:27:28.506 --> 02:27:31.943 region:rollup2
BETTER.

02:27:30.742 --> 02:27:33.511 region:rollup2
IT SHARING INFORMATION AND

02:27:31.943 --> 02:27:34.913 region:rollup2
COORDINATING.

02:27:33.511 --> 02:27:37.015 region:rollup2
BUT I THINK IT'S AND IT'S IT'S A

02:27:34.913 --> 02:27:39.184 region:rollup2
LITTLE BIT OUT BEYOND OUR CAR

02:27:37.015 --> 02:27:41.152 region:rollup2
OUR PORTFOLIO TO ACTUALLY TALK

02:27:39.184 --> 02:27:42.454 region:rollup2
ABOUT WHETHER SOMEBODY ELSE

02:27:41.152 --> 02:27:46.691 region:rollup2
SHOULD DO IT.

02:27:42.454 --> 02:27:47.859 region:rollup2
THERE ARE TIMES WE DO OUR BEST.

02:27:46.691 --> 02:27:50.862 region:rollup2
ALRIGHT WE WOULD [inaudible]

02:27:47.859 --> 02:27:52.797 region:rollup2
MR DOT.

AS MY COLLEAGUE FROM THE SECOND

02:28:04.309 --> 02:28:06.678 region:rollup2
ASSEMBLY DISTRICT NOTED THAT

02:28:05.510 --> 02:28:08.947 region:rollup2
TIME.

02:28:06.678 --> 02:28:11.316 region:rollup2
A COUPLE YEARS BACK ON I DID

02:28:08.947 --> 02:28:12.817 region:rollup2
STAND ON THE FLOOR AND SAY.

02:28:11.316 --> 02:28:13.118 region:rollup2
FIRES IN EFFECT CALIFORNIA

02:28:12.817 --> 02:28:14.452 region:rollup2
[inaudible]

02:28:13.118 --> 02:28:17.055 region:rollup2
YEAH.

02:28:14.452 --> 02:28:19.090 region:rollup2
IT'S WITH A HEAVY HEART. TO KNOW

02:28:17.055 --> 02:28:21.059 region:rollup2
THAT WE LOST ABOUT FIFTY LIVES.

02:28:19.090 --> 02:28:23.061 region:rollup2
THE CALIFORNIA AND WE'RE NOT

02:28:21.059 --> 02:28:24.763 region:rollup2
ADDRESSING THE PROBLEM AND WE

02:28:23.061 --> 02:28:25.363 region:rollup2
ARE HERE BECAUSE OF LIABILITY

02:28:24.763 --> 02:28:26.598 region:rollup2
WE'RE HERE BECAUSE WHO'S GONNA

02:28:25.363 --> 02:28:27.599 region:rollup2
PAY.

02:28:26.598 --> 02:28:28.600 region:rollup2
AND WE'RE GOING TO TRY TO FIGURE

02:28:27.599 --> 02:28:30.068 region:rollup2
THAT OUT BUT AT THE END OF THE

02:28:28.600 --> 02:28:32.470 region:rollup2
DAY WE HAVE A FUEL LOADING

02:28:30.068 --> 02:28:33.405 region:rollup2
PROBLEM.

02:28:32.470 --> 02:28:35.306 region:rollup2
AND WE HAVE TAKEN A LOT OF THE

02:28:33.405 --> 02:28:38.376 region:rollup2
TOOLS AWAY.

02:28:35.306 --> 02:28:40.211 region:rollup2
THAT WE MANAGE THOSE HEELS WITH.

02:28:38.376 --> 02:28:41.246 region:rollup2
I'VE DEBATED ABOUT GRAZING.

02:28:40.211 --> 02:28:43.281 region:rollup2
I DEBATED ABOUT HOW WITHIN A

02:28:41.246 --> 02:28:44.849 region:rollup2
FORCED.

02:28:43.281 --> 02:28:45.450 region:rollup2
IN THE SIZE OF A TREE THAT YOU

02:28:44.849 --> 02:28:46.484 region:rollup2
NEED TO COME OUT WHEN THEY'LL

02:28:45.450 --> 02:28:47.986 region:rollup2
BURN DOWN.

02:28:46.484 --> 02:28:50.021 region:rollup2
NOW WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT SOME

02:28:47.986 --> 02:28:51.556 region:rollup2
SERIOUS THINGS THAT HAPPEN HERE

02:28:50.021 --> 02:28:52.857 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA IF BEFORE WE LOSE.

02:28:51.556 --> 02:28:57.295 region:rollup2
A LOT MORE LIVES AND A HELL OF A

02:28:52.857 --> 02:28:58.830 region:rollup2
LOT OF PROPERTY DAMAGE.

02:28:57.295 --> 02:29:00.365 region:rollup2
SO I'M EXCITED ABOUT THIS

02:28:58.830 --> 02:29:00.965 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE BUT THERE A LOT OF

02:29:00.365 --> 02:29:01.699 region:rollup2
THINGS THAT WE'RE NOT TALKING

02:29:00.965 --> 02:29:02.700 region:rollup2
ABOUT.

02:29:01.699 --> 02:29:04.402 region:rollup2
WE SPENT ABOUT THREE BILLION

02:29:02.700 --> 02:29:06.538 region:rollup2
DOLLARS.

02:29:04.402 --> 02:29:08.106 region:rollup2
FROM 200-082-2000 AND FOURTEEN

02:29:06.538 --> 02:29:09.040 region:rollup2
FIGHTING FIRE.

02:29:08.106 --> 02:29:10.975 region:rollup2
AND WE LOST SOME GOOD MEN AND

02:29:09.040 --> 02:29:12.210 region:rollup2
WOMEN OUT THERE DOING IT.

02:29:10.975 --> 02:29:13.912 region:rollup2
WE PUT A LOT OF MONEY THEIR WE

02:29:12.210 --> 02:29:15.079 region:rollup2
TALKED ABOUT THE GREENHOUSE GAS

02:29:13.912 --> 02:29:16.815 region:rollup2
FUNDS WE'VE TALKED ABOUT ISSUES

02:29:15.079 --> 02:29:18.516 region:rollup2
WE TALKED ABOUT.

02:29:16.815 --> 02:29:20.318 region:rollup2
HOW WE GONNA TAKE THE BIOMASS

02:29:18.516 --> 02:29:21.686 region:rollup2
AND PUT IT INTO A PLEA AND WHO'S

02:29:20.318 --> 02:29:24.122 region:rollup2
GONNA PAY FOR THAT?

02:29:21.686 --> 02:29:25.723 region:rollup2
AND BATTLED THOSE OUT BIPARTISAN

02:29:24.122 --> 02:29:27.358 region:rollup2
IS NOT A PARTISAN ISSUE.

02:29:25.723 --> 02:29:29.427 region:rollup2
THIS IS A A PUBLIC PART WHETHER

02:29:27.358 --> 02:29:31.162 region:rollup2
WE HAVE YOU KNOW TALK ABOUT IT

02:29:29.427 --> 02:29:32.197 region:rollup2
THERE'S DEBATE ABOUT CLIMATE

02:29:31.162 --> 02:29:33.364 region:rollup2
CHANGE NOT COMMITTEES MANY TIES

02:29:32.197 --> 02:29:35.033 region:rollup2
UP WE ARE CLIMATE IS CHANGING.

02:29:33.364 --> 02:29:36.768 region:rollup2
SO HUNDRED AND TWENTY DEGREES IN

02:29:35.033 --> 02:29:37.802 region:rollup2
PLACES WORST.

02:29:36.768 --> 02:29:39.971 region:rollup2
USED TO HER LAB.

02:29:37.802 --> 02:29:42.273 region:rollup2
SO I WANTED TO SHARE YES.

02:29:39.971 --> 02:29:43.875 region:rollup2
MY FRUSTRATION WITH.

02:29:42.273 --> 02:29:45.276 region:rollup2
THE BILLION NOT REALLY ADDRESSED

02:29:43.875 --> 02:29:47.545 region:rollup2
THE BIG PROBLEM THIS IS HOW ARE

02:29:45.276 --> 02:29:48.112 region:rollup2
WE IN A MAJOR FUEL WE CAN SHUT

02:29:47.545 --> 02:29:49.614 region:rollup2
DOWN THE GRID LIGHTING WILL

02:29:48.112 --> 02:29:51.182 region:rollup2
STILL STRIKE.

02:29:49.614 --> 02:29:53.151 region:rollup2
MEN MAKE BECAUSE THE A CAR CAN

02:29:51.182 --> 02:29:54.185 region:rollup2
STARTED A RAILROAD THERE'S SO

02:29:53.151 --> 02:29:54.786 region:rollup2
MANY OTHER THINGS OUT THERE THAT

02:29:54.185 --> 02:29:57.155 region:rollup2
WE DON'T.

02:29:54.786 --> 02:29:59.324 region:rollup2
TALK ABOUT THE CAN START FIRE

02:29:57.155 --> 02:30:00.558 region:rollup2
BUT I THOUGHT HUNDRED

02:29:59.324 --> 02:30:02.460 region:rollup2
LEGISLATORS TO MY DISTRICT.

02:30:00.558 --> 02:30:04.496 region:rollup2
AND I TAKE A MOUNTAIN FORCED.

02:30:02.460 --> 02:30:06.898 region:rollup2
AND I SHAUNA FORCES OVERGROWN

02:30:04.496 --> 02:30:08.066 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF OUR POLICIES STOPPING

02:30:06.898 --> 02:30:09.834 region:rollup2
WELFARE YOU CAN'T PUT WELFARE

02:30:08.066 --> 02:30:12.203 region:rollup2
BACK IN THAT.

02:30:09.834 --> 02:30:13.905 region:rollup2
FORCE BECAUSE THEY CROWN NOW

02:30:12.203 --> 02:30:15.240 region:rollup2
THAT MEANS THAT THE TREES BURN.

02:30:13.905 --> 02:30:17.308 region:rollup2
THEY'RE TOO CLOSE TOGETHER THE

02:30:15.240 --> 02:30:17.842 region:rollup2
FIRE BURNS FROM TREE TO TREE.

02:30:17.308 --> 02:30:20.578 region:rollup2
WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT THE

02:30:17.842 --> 02:30:22.413 region:rollup2
CANOPY.

02:30:20.578 --> 02:30:23.882 region:rollup2
THAT MEANS OPEN UP THAT FOREST

02:30:22.413 --> 02:30:26.284 region:rollup2
SO THAT FIRE CAN BURN ON THE

02:30:23.882 --> 02:30:28.052 region:rollup2
FLOOR LIKE IT'S SUPPOSED TO LOW.

02:30:26.284 --> 02:30:29.888 region:rollup2
AND WE CAN MANAGE THAT FIRE.

02:30:28.052 --> 02:30:31.923 region:rollup2
WE HAVE ABOUT THE WHOLE STATE IN

02:30:29.888 --> 02:30:33.057 region:rollup2
MY MIND IS A HIGH FIRE SEVERITY

02:30:31.923 --> 02:30:34.492 region:rollup2
ZONE NOT YOU'RE ON THE COAST

02:30:33.057 --> 02:30:36.661 region:rollup2
WE'LL HEAR THAT JACKSON LIVES.

02:30:34.492 --> 02:30:39.030 region:rollup2
IT'S BRUSH THEIR WHO NEED TO

02:30:36.661 --> 02:30:40.064 region:rollup2
MANAGE THAT AND IT'S A LIVE. ONE

02:30:39.030 --> 02:30:41.799 region:rollup2
THING I THINK GO OUR

02:30:40.064 --> 02:30:44.135 region:rollup2
CONSTITUENTS DONOR STAND IS THAT

02:30:41.799 --> 02:30:46.004 region:rollup2
IT IS GROWING EVERY SINGLE DAY.

02:30:44.135 --> 02:30:48.206 region:rollup2
IS GROWING UP THERE RIGHT NOW.

02:30:46.004 --> 02:30:51.042 region:rollup2
AND IT WILL BURN.

02:30:48.206 --> 02:30:53.111 region:rollup2
UNLESS WE MANAGE THAT FUEL.

02:30:51.042 --> 02:30:55.079 region:rollup2
WE HAVE TO GET THE IDEOLOGY OF

02:30:53.111 --> 02:30:56.748 region:rollup2
COTTON A CERTAIN SIZE TREE OR

02:30:55.079 --> 02:30:57.849 region:rollup2
PUTTING GRAZING IN OR WHATEVER

02:30:56.748 --> 02:30:59.417 region:rollup2
THOSE TOOLS ARE WE GOING TO

02:30:57.849 --> 02:31:00.218 region:rollup2
START TALKING ABOUT THOSE TOOLS.

02:30:59.417 --> 02:31:02.353 region:rollup2
THAT WE HAVE AVAILABLE TO US

02:31:00.218 --> 02:31:04.022 region:rollup2
THAT DON'T COST OUR RATE PAYERS

02:31:02.353 --> 02:31:06.457 region:rollup2
AND OUR TAXPAYERS USUALLY PAY

02:31:04.022 --> 02:31:08.393 region:rollup2
FOR IT THAT AT THE UTILITY BILL

02:31:06.457 --> 02:31:10.194 region:rollup2
ARE GONNA PAY FOR BY PUTTING MEN

02:31:08.393 --> 02:31:12.263 region:rollup2
AND WOMEN IN HELICOPTERS AND

02:31:10.194 --> 02:31:12.830 region:rollup2
AVIATION AND BULLDOZERS AND ALL

02:31:12.263 --> 02:31:14.832 region:rollup2
THAT OTHER THEN YOU'RE GONNA

02:31:12.830 --> 02:31:15.733 region:rollup2
PAY.

02:31:14.832 --> 02:31:17.635 region:rollup2
FOR WHEN YOU GET YOUR WATER BILL

02:31:15.733 --> 02:31:19.037 region:rollup2
BECAUSE AFTER BURNS THE REAL

02:31:17.635 --> 02:31:21.873 region:rollup2
DEVASTATION COMES IN WE HAVE THE

02:31:19.037 --> 02:31:24.275 region:rollup2
SLIDES WE HAVE HUGE.

02:31:21.873 --> 02:31:24.809 region:rollup2
HUNDREDS OF SQUARE MILES

02:31:24.275 --> 02:31:26.611 region:rollup2
THOUSAND SQUARE MILES OF

02:31:24.809 --> 02:31:28.680 region:rollup2
WATERSHED THIS DESTROYED FOR THE

02:31:26.611 --> 02:31:31.049 region:rollup2
NEXT TWENTY FIVE YEARS.

02:31:28.680 --> 02:31:32.884 region:rollup2
SO I KNOW I'M RAMBLING BUT I'M

02:31:31.049 --> 02:31:33.451 region:rollup2
I'M I WANT TO MAKE THE POINT

02:31:32.884 --> 02:31:34.452 region:rollup2
THAT WE HAVE TO ADDRESS THE

02:31:33.451 --> 02:31:35.987 region:rollup2
PROBLEM.

02:31:34.452 --> 02:31:36.621 region:rollup2
THE PROBLEM IS THE FUEL LOADING

02:31:35.987 --> 02:31:39.524 region:rollup2
OUT THERE WE NEED TO PUT THE

02:31:36.621 --> 02:31:40.091 region:rollup2
TOOLS AND POLICIES IN PLACE THAT

02:31:39.524 --> 02:31:41.025 region:rollup2
ALLOW US TO START DIRECTING

02:31:40.091 --> 02:31:42.660 region:rollup2
THAT.

02:31:41.025 --> 02:31:44.362 region:rollup2
PROBLEM THIS IS BEEN THERE FOR

02:31:42.660 --> 02:31:45.430 region:rollup2
OVER A HUNDRED YEARS.

02:31:44.362 --> 02:31:47.465 region:rollup2
AND THERE'S A LOT OF POLITICAL

02:31:45.430 --> 02:31:48.433 region:rollup2
THINGS THAT HAPPEN IN YOUR YOU

02:31:47.465 --> 02:31:50.201 region:rollup2
DON'T ADDRESS THE PROBLEM

02:31:48.433 --> 02:31:51.836 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT'S JUST WHAT THE WHAT

02:31:50.201 --> 02:31:53.571 region:rollup2
THE PRESIDENT SAID.

02:31:51.836 --> 02:31:55.506 region:rollup2
THERE'S THE WATER QUALITY PART

02:31:53.571 --> 02:31:56.808 region:rollup2
OF IT THERE'S THE FORESTRY PART

02:31:55.506 --> 02:31:58.142 region:rollup2
OF IT THERE'S THE FIREFIGHTING

02:31:56.808 --> 02:31:59.877 region:rollup2
PARTS OF IT THERE'S A LIABILITY

02:31:58.142 --> 02:32:01.546 region:rollup2
PART OF IT THERE'S ALL THESE

REGULATIONS ON THAT.

02:34:41.939 --> 02:34:46.577 region:rollup2
SOME OF A LITTLE CONCERNED ABOUT

02:34:44.075 --> 02:34:48.312 region:rollup2
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MASSIVE WILD

02:34:46.577 --> 02:34:50.615 region:rollup2
WILD FIRE MITIGATION PLANS HOW

02:34:48.312 --> 02:34:53.217 region:rollup2
THAT HAPPENS OUT THERE.

02:34:50.615 --> 02:34:55.353 region:rollup2
WHEN WE CAN GET REGULATIONS ON A

02:34:53.217 --> 02:34:56.621 region:rollup2
ON A ON A BILL TO TWEAK AN

02:34:55.353 --> 02:34:58.956 region:rollup2
EXISTING SYSTEM?

02:34:56.621 --> 02:35:01.959 region:rollup2
IN LESS THAN TWO YEARS.

02:34:58.956 --> 02:35:04.262 region:rollup2
SO -- SO.

02:35:01.959 --> 02:35:05.963 region:rollup2
I HAVE A I HAVE THE SAME

02:35:04.262 --> 02:35:07.799 region:rollup2
FRUSTRATIONS I'LL JUST SAY THAT

02:35:05.963 --> 02:35:08.866 region:rollup2
WE WERE DESIGNED TO SLOW THINGS

02:35:07.799 --> 02:35:10.535 region:rollup2
DOWN.

02:35:08.866 --> 02:35:13.070 region:rollup2
WE WERE DESIGNED TO MAKE SURE

02:35:10.535 --> 02:35:13.871 region:rollup2
EVERYBODY HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO

02:35:13.070 --> 02:35:16.741 region:rollup2
LITIGATE.

02:35:13.871 --> 02:35:17.909 region:rollup2
BOTH THE POLICY AND ALL THE

02:35:16.741 --> 02:35:19.443 region:rollup2
CHANGES THAT ARE MADE STRAIGHT

02:35:17.909 --> 02:35:20.444 region:rollup2
PEOPLE GET DIFFERENT BITES AT

02:35:19.443 --> 02:35:25.383 region:rollup2
THE APPLE.

02:35:20.444 --> 02:35:25.917 region:rollup2
AND PARTICULARLY WHEN YOU'RE

02:35:25.383 --> 02:35:26.851 region:rollup2
DEALING WITH VERY LARGE.

02:35:25.917 --> 02:35:28.753 region:rollup2
PEOPLE HAVE FOUND THAT THAT IS

02:35:26.851 --> 02:35:30.988 region:rollup2
NECESSARY.

02:35:28.753 --> 02:35:33.090 region:rollup2
SO -- IF YOU

02:35:30.988 --> 02:35:34.959 region:rollup2
FEEL LIKE YOU NEED A DIFFERENT

02:35:33.090 --> 02:35:36.928 region:rollup2
STANDARD BY WHICH WE ADOPT

02:35:34.959 --> 02:35:38.596 region:rollup2
CERTAIN KINDS OF POLICIES.

02:35:36.928 --> 02:35:40.431 region:rollup2
THEN PERHAPS YOU NEED TO REALLY

02:35:38.596 --> 02:35:43.100 region:rollup2
KIND OF THINK ABOUT REDESIGNING

02:35:40.431 --> 02:35:44.802 region:rollup2
OUR PROCESSES I WILL SAY THAT

02:35:43.100 --> 02:35:47.538 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE THE FEATURES THERE

02:35:44.802 --> 02:35:49.907 region:rollup2
WERE WERE WRESTLING WITH IS THAT

02:35:47.538 --> 02:35:51.542 region:rollup2
WE CAN DO SOME OF OUR FIVE SAY

02:35:49.907 --> 02:35:53.010 region:rollup2
LEGISLATIVE PROCEEDINGS.

02:35:51.542 --> 02:35:54.912 region:rollup2
THROUGH NOTICING CAR COMMENT

02:35:53.010 --> 02:35:57.248 region:rollup2
PROCESSES THAT'S NEW TO US IN

02:35:54.912 --> 02:35:58.783 region:rollup2
WORD WORD WE'RE CONTINUING TO TO

02:35:57.248 --> 02:36:01.319 region:rollup2
FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO THAT.

02:35:58.783 --> 02:36:03.955 region:rollup2
EXPEDITIOUSLY HIM FAIRLY.

02:36:01.319 --> 02:36:05.323 region:rollup2
SO IT WOULD RATHER THAN HAVING

02:36:03.955 --> 02:36:07.058 region:rollup2
PEOPLE COME BEFORE A

02:36:05.323 --> 02:36:09.393 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE.

02:36:07.058 --> 02:36:10.628 region:rollup2
AND PRESENTING A CASE AS TO WHY

02:36:09.393 --> 02:36:12.196 region:rollup2
THEY OUGHT TO BE ALLOWED TO

02:36:10.628 --> 02:36:13.931 region:rollup2
PARTICIPATE.

02:36:12.196 --> 02:36:16.667 region:rollup2
HAVING THE PARTY'S COMMENT ON A

THE SCOPING DOCUMENT REPUBLISHED

02:36:18.703 --> 02:36:21.906 region:rollup2
IS IN ORDER.

02:36:19.871 --> 02:36:25.376 region:rollup2
THEN HAVING AND PEOPLE SUBMIT

02:36:21.906 --> 02:36:26.978 region:rollup2

LITIGATION SOMETIME BIFURCATING

02:36:44.595 --> 02:36:47.732 region:rollup2
PIECES OF IT WHERE THERE'S NOT A

02:36:46.564 --> 02:36:52.837 region:rollup2
CONSENSUS OR A CLEAR RECORD.

02:36:47.732 --> 02:36:54.372 region:rollup2
YEAH THAT'S SLOW.

02:36:52.837 --> 02:36:55.273 region:rollup2

HOW LONG IF YOU'RE IF YOU'RE

02:37:02.980 --> 02:37:08.619 region:rollup2
DESIGNED TO SLOW THINGS DOWN?

02:37:06.217 --> 02:37:09.620 region:rollup2
HOW LONG IS IT GOING TO TAKE?

02:37:08.619 --> 02:37:10.888 region:rollup2
FOR US TO MOVE FORWARD ON SOME

02:37:09.620 --> 02:37:12.456 region:rollup2
OF THESE THINGS THAT WE REALLY

02:37:10.888 --> 02:37:14.392 region:rollup2
NEED TO MOVE FORWARD HOW LONG IS

02:37:12.456 --> 02:37:16.360 region:rollup2
IT REALISTICALLY TAKE TO REVIEW

02:37:14.392 --> 02:37:17.028 region:rollup2
THESE FIRE MITIGATION PLANS HOW

02:37:16.360 --> 02:37:18.396 region:rollup2
LONG IS IT GOING TO

02:37:17.028 --> 02:37:20.064 region:rollup2
REALISTICALLY TAKE TO DO THE

02:37:18.396 --> 02:37:21.832 region:rollup2
INSPECTIONS THAT ARE NECESSARY.

02:37:20.064 --> 02:37:24.201 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I'M REAL CONCERNED ABOUT

02:37:21.832 --> 02:37:25.269 region:rollup2
THAT BASED ON MY MY PERSONAL

02:37:24.201 --> 02:37:27.505 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCE WITH THE WAY THINGS

02:37:25.269 --> 02:37:28.839 region:rollup2
WORK WELL I'D JUST BE HONEST

02:37:27.505 --> 02:37:30.741 region:rollup2
WITH YOU ABOUT ONE THING WHEN WE

02:37:28.839 --> 02:37:33.344 region:rollup2
DEPART FROM THE LONG STANDING

02:37:30.741 --> 02:37:34.945 region:rollup2
PRACTICE OR PRECEDENT FOR A SET

02:37:33.344 --> 02:37:35.913 region:rollup2

HE GETS LITIGATED WE GET SUED

02:37:35.913 --> 02:37:40.318 region:rollup2
SOMETIMES PUBLIC POLICY ARGUMENT

02:37:39.083 --> 02:37:42.186 region:rollup2
AS TO WHY WE'RE DOING THINGS

02:37:40.318 --> 02:37:44.255 region:rollup2
DIFFERENTLY IN THE FUTURE.

02:37:42.186 --> 02:37:46.123 region:rollup2
IT'S HELPFUL TO GET DIRECTION.

02:37:44.255 --> 02:37:47.758 region:rollup2
CHANGE THOSE THINGS.

02:37:46.123 --> 02:37:49.393 region:rollup2
THEN THAT AT LEAST IS ONE OF THE

02:37:47.758 --> 02:37:52.196 region:rollup2
PUBLIC POLICY ELEMENTS THAT WE

02:37:49.393 --> 02:37:54.265 region:rollup2
CAN DEPEND ON WHEN WE GET SUED.

02:37:52.196 --> 02:37:55.833 region:rollup2
SO I'LL BE HONEST WITH YOU THAT

02:37:54.265 --> 02:37:57.902 region:rollup2
IT'S IF THAT IS THE DIRECTION

02:37:55.833 --> 02:37:58.769 region:rollup2
THE LEGISLATURE WHICH IS FOR US

02:37:57.902 --> 02:37:59.603 region:rollup2
TO GO.

02:37:58.769 --> 02:38:02.273 region:rollup2
YOU SHOULD.

02:37:59.603 --> 02:38:03.975 region:rollup2
TELL US WHERE AND WHEN WE SHOULD

02:38:02.273 --> 02:38:05.576 region:rollup2
USE THOSE OF THOSE NEW --

02:38:03.975 --> 02:38:07.745 region:rollup2
KINDS OF AUTHORITIES WHEN TO

02:38:05.576 --> 02:38:09.113 region:rollup2
EXPEDITE PROCESSES WINTER

02:38:07.745 --> 02:38:10.848 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY GO.

02:38:09.113 --> 02:38:13.484 region:rollup2
IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTION.

02:38:10.848 --> 02:38:14.185 region:rollup2
THE OTHER ALTERNATIVE IS WHAT --

02:38:13.484 --> 02:38:15.820 region:rollup2
WHAT --

02:38:14.185 --> 02:38:17.054 region:rollup2
ASSEMBLY MEMBER HOLDEN SUGGESTED

02:38:15.820 --> 02:38:19.323 region:rollup2
WHICH IS THAT MAYBE THERE ARE

02:38:17.054 --> 02:38:20.391 region:rollup2
OTHER VENUES WHERE THESE THINGS

02:38:19.323 --> 02:38:22.193 region:rollup2
ARE DECIDED AS A MATTER OF

02:38:20.391 --> 02:38:23.861 region:rollup2
PUBLIC POLICY AND THAT IT'S UP

02:38:22.193 --> 02:38:24.929 region:rollup2
TO US TO IMPLEMENT.

02:38:23.861 --> 02:38:26.597 region:rollup2
STILL WILL TAKE SOME TIME

02:38:24.929 --> 02:38:28.165 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT MEANS TO IMPLEMENT

02:38:26.597 --> 02:38:28.899 region:rollup2
THINGS YOU GOTTA HAVE PEOPLE IF

02:38:28.165 --> 02:38:30.334 region:rollup2
IT'S NEW.

02:38:28.899 --> 02:38:31.335 region:rollup2
HE GOT TO HAVE THEM TRAINED YOU

02:38:30.334 --> 02:38:33.237 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THE

02:38:31.335 --> 02:38:35.306 region:rollup2
STEPS.

02:38:33.237 --> 02:38:36.974 region:rollup2
BUT I THINK THAT THAT.

02:38:35.306 --> 02:38:38.809 region:rollup2
I DON'T DISAGREE WITH YOU THAT

02:38:36.974 --> 02:38:40.644 region:rollup2
IT'S A LONG TEDIOUS PROCESS ALL

02:38:38.809 --> 02:38:42.046 region:rollup2
I'VE DISCOVERED IS THAT THAT'S

02:38:40.644 --> 02:38:44.548 region:rollup2
THE WAY WE WORK DESIGN.

02:38:42.046 --> 02:38:45.616 region:rollup2
THAT WAS PURPOSEFUL.

02:38:44.548 --> 02:38:45.916 region:rollup2
YOU WANT TO CHANGE IT

02:38:45.616 --> 02:38:47.985 region:rollup2
[inaudible]

02:38:45.916 --> 02:38:49.120 region:rollup2
JACK.

02:38:47.985 --> 02:38:50.588 region:rollup2
I'M JUST CONCERNED I DON'T WANNA

02:38:49.120 --> 02:38:50.888 region:rollup2
BE HERE FIVE YEARS FROM NOW

02:38:50.588 --> 02:38:53.090 region:rollup2
[inaudible]

02:38:50.888 --> 02:38:54.392 region:rollup2
WHEN?

02:38:53.090 --> 02:38:56.627 region:rollup2
MILLIONS OF MORE ACRES MAYBE OF

02:38:54.392 --> 02:38:58.429 region:rollup2
BURNING CALIFORNIA AND MANY MANY

02:38:56.627 --> 02:38:59.463 region:rollup2
MORE LIVES OF LOS WONDERING WHAT

02:38:58.429 --> 02:39:01.599 region:rollup2
THE HECK ARE WE DOING SO I

02:38:59.463 --> 02:39:03.667 region:rollup2
PROJECT MY PASSION BUT NO I LIVE

02:39:01.599 --> 02:39:04.902 region:rollup2
THIS IS MY DISTRICT GASES WERE

02:39:03.667 --> 02:39:06.437 region:rollup2
FORTY FOUR PEOPLE. FORTY FOR MY

02:39:04.902 --> 02:39:07.271 region:rollup2
CONSTITUENTS DIE.

02:39:06.437 --> 02:39:09.940 region:rollup2
AND I'M I DON'T WANT TO SEE

02:39:07.271 --> 02:39:11.475 region:rollup2
ANYMORE DOT WEIRD I WATCHED FOR

02:39:09.940 --> 02:39:13.144 region:rollup2
FOUR YEARS --

02:39:11.475 --> 02:39:14.912 region:rollup2
LITIGANTS PARTIES IN OUR

02:39:13.144 --> 02:39:16.514 region:rollup2
PROCEEDINGS ARGUING ABOUT WHAT

02:39:14.912 --> 02:39:17.982 region:rollup2
IS THE PROPER LIFE SPAN OF

02:39:16.514 --> 02:39:19.383 region:rollup2
WOODEN POLES IT FORTY YEARS

02:39:17.982 --> 02:39:22.820 region:rollup2
SERVICES SEVENTY YEARS WHETHER

02:39:19.383 --> 02:39:24.088 region:rollup2
THE CRITERIA USED TO TO TO

02:39:22.820 --> 02:39:25.289 region:rollup2
EVALUATE WHETHER WHERE UNDER

02:39:24.088 --> 02:39:27.591 region:rollup2
UNDER WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES YOU

02:39:25.289 --> 02:39:28.426 region:rollup2
SHOULD YOU SHOULD EVALUATE IT

02:39:27.591 --> 02:39:29.160 region:rollup2
DIFFERENTLY.

02:39:28.426 --> 02:39:31.195 region:rollup2
THAT SEEMS LIKE COULD BE A

02:39:29.160 --> 02:39:32.463 region:rollup2
SIMPLE QUESTION.

02:39:31.195 --> 02:39:34.532 region:rollup2
BUT I GOTTA TELL YOU THEIR WORK

02:39:32.463 --> 02:39:36.200 region:rollup2
PANEL LIKE THE TAX COURTS WERE

02:39:34.532 --> 02:39:37.802 region:rollup2
KINDA LIKE --

02:39:36.200 --> 02:39:39.437 region:rollup2
THE ADMIRALTY COURTS WERE KINDA

02:39:37.802 --> 02:39:41.138 region:rollup2
LIKE THE PATENT COURTS AND I

02:39:39.437 --> 02:39:42.706 region:rollup2
WILL REMIND YOU THAT THE

02:39:41.138 --> 02:39:44.108 region:rollup2
ADMIRALTY COURTS ARE STILL

02:39:42.706 --> 02:39:45.876 region:rollup2
LITIGATING WHETHER THE SPANISH

02:39:44.108 --> 02:39:47.678 region:rollup2
ADMIRAL MADE A MISTAKE GOING TO

02:39:45.876 --> 02:39:48.979 region:rollup2
THE WEST SIDE OF SCOTLAND AFTER

02:39:47.678 --> 02:39:51.382 region:rollup2
HE GOT.

02:39:48.979 --> 02:39:52.450 region:rollup2
BEAT BY THE BY DRAKE AND AND

02:39:51.382 --> 02:39:55.820 region:rollup2
ENGLISH CHANNEL.

02:39:52.450 --> 02:39:58.422 region:rollup2
SO THOSE THINGS.

02:39:55.820 --> 02:40:01.058 region:rollup2
YOU MAY WANT NOT WANT TO KIND OF

02:39:58.422 --> 02:40:02.960 region:rollup2
JUDICIAL BODY THAT WE WE WE FORM

02:40:01.058 --> 02:40:04.395 region:rollup2
BUT IN OTHER CASES THERE SEEMS

02:40:02.960 --> 02:40:06.063 region:rollup2
TO BE A PREFERENCE TO HAVE US

02:40:04.395 --> 02:40:08.299 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR IN THINKS INVOLVED

02:40:06.063 --> 02:40:10.901 region:rollup2
EXPENDITURES OF MONEY.

02:40:08.299 --> 02:40:13.304 region:rollup2
DO WE HAVE STANDARDS ON POLLS.

02:40:10.901 --> 02:40:15.840 region:rollup2
WE HAVE STANDARDS ON POLLS BUT

02:40:13.304 --> 02:40:17.475 region:rollup2
THE HOW DO YOU BEGIN TO APPLY

02:40:15.840 --> 02:40:19.310 region:rollup2
THEM WITH FOR ME AND PULLS DO

02:40:17.475 --> 02:40:21.479 region:rollup2
YOU DO IT ON A HIGH EVERY SIX

02:40:19.310 --> 02:40:23.113 region:rollup2
MONTHS BASIS DO YOU DO IT ON A

02:40:21.479 --> 02:40:24.615 region:rollup2
FIVE YEAR BASIS DO IT ON A TEN

02:40:23.113 --> 02:40:25.883 region:rollup2
YEAR BASIS IN INVASIVE

02:40:24.615 --> 02:40:27.818 region:rollup2
INSPECTION.

02:40:25.883 --> 02:40:29.153 region:rollup2
USUALLY DONE EVERY FIVE TO TEN

02:40:27.818 --> 02:40:31.255 region:rollup2
YEARS DEPENDING UPON WHERE THE

02:40:29.153 --> 02:40:33.123 region:rollup2
LOCATION.

02:40:31.255 --> 02:40:35.326 region:rollup2
BUT POLLS TEND TO BE FAIRLY LONG

02:40:33.123 --> 02:40:36.827 region:rollup2
LYFT OBJECTS I REMEMBER THAT A

02:40:35.326 --> 02:40:38.796 region:rollup2
PUBLICLY OWNED UTILITY IN THE

02:40:36.827 --> 02:40:40.431 region:rollup2
PUBLICLY OWNED UTILITIES TEND TO

02:40:38.796 --> 02:40:42.433 region:rollup2
ARGUE THAT THEY ARE NOT UNDER

02:40:40.431 --> 02:40:44.201 region:rollup2
OURS ARE SUPERVISION.

02:40:42.433 --> 02:40:47.471 region:rollup2
WHERE THE GENERAL MANAGER OF

02:40:44.201 --> 02:40:48.405 region:rollup2
LADWP SAID THAT POLL IS BENT

02:40:47.471 --> 02:40:50.441 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT?

02:40:48.405 --> 02:40:52.510 region:rollup2
WAS PROLLY FIRST PLACED IN THAT

02:40:50.441 --> 02:40:54.245 region:rollup2
LOCATION WITH THOMAS EDISON

02:40:52.510 --> 02:40:56.380 region:rollup2
WALKED THE FACE OF YOUR SO DO WE

02:40:54.245 --> 02:40:58.249 region:rollup2
ABANDON THE VALUE OF A POLL THAT

02:40:56.380 --> 02:41:00.618 region:rollup2
STILL IS FUNCTIONAL.

02:40:58.249 --> 02:41:01.619 region:rollup2
WHERE DO WE DO WE TRY TO FOCUS

02:41:00.618 --> 02:41:03.320 region:rollup2
ON THE ONES THAT TRULY NEED

02:41:01.619 --> 02:41:05.089 region:rollup2
REPLACE?

02:41:03.320 --> 02:41:06.891 region:rollup2
I TEND TO ERR ON THE SIDE OF

02:41:05.089 --> 02:41:09.126 region:rollup2
SAFETY BUT THAT'S NOT SOMETHING

02:41:06.891 --> 02:41:10.895 region:rollup2
THAT THERE'S AGREEMENT.

02:41:09.126 --> 02:41:12.530 region:rollup2
YES AND AND AT A CHRISTIAN AND I

02:41:10.895 --> 02:41:14.031 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND THE PREDICAMENT THERE

02:41:12.530 --> 02:41:14.832 region:rollup2
APPRECIATE THAT.

02:41:14.031 --> 02:41:16.500 region:rollup2
DO WE HAVE NGUYEN STANDARDS ON

02:41:14.832 --> 02:41:18.502 region:rollup2
POLLS.

02:41:16.500 --> 02:41:20.137 region:rollup2
WE DO THEY'RE VERY COMPLICATED

02:41:18.502 --> 02:41:21.872 region:rollup2
AND I DON'T THINK THAT THAT THE

02:41:20.137 --> 02:41:23.707 region:rollup2
ASSUMPTIONS THAT WE MADE TWENTY

02:41:21.872 --> 02:41:25.543 region:rollup2
YEARS AGO THIRTY YEARS AGO STAND

02:41:23.707 --> 02:41:26.277 region:rollup2
UP TO THE KINDS OF CONDITIONS

02:41:25.543 --> 02:41:28.012 region:rollup2
THAT WE SAW IN NORTHERN

02:41:26.277 --> 02:41:29.980 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA I CAN A LITTLE LEASE

02:41:28.012 --> 02:41:31.682 region:rollup2
OF ATTIC. TO GO INTO MUCH DEEPER

02:41:29.980 --> 02:41:33.117 region:rollup2
BUT BASICALLY LOOK AT ALL THE

02:41:31.682 --> 02:41:34.752 region:rollup2
EQUIPMENT CLEANING

02:41:33.117 --> 02:41:37.488 region:rollup2
TELECOMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT

02:41:34.752 --> 02:41:38.989 region:rollup2
THAT'S INSTALLED ON HE SAID.

02:41:37.488 --> 02:41:41.025 region:rollup2
MORE --

02:41:38.989 --> 02:41:43.394 region:rollup2
EQUIPMENTS ATTACHABLE CAN ACT

02:41:41.025 --> 02:41:44.962 region:rollup2
LIKE A SAIL WORK MORE WIRES THAT

02:41:43.394 --> 02:41:45.663 region:rollup2
PUT ON THAT PEOPLE CAN ACT LIKE

02:41:44.962 --> 02:41:47.064 region:rollup2
A SALE.

02:41:45.663 --> 02:41:49.066 region:rollup2
IT CAN RESULT IN BREAKAGE

02:41:47.064 --> 02:41:50.434 region:rollup2
OVERTOPPING.

02:41:49.066 --> 02:41:52.169 region:rollup2
AND I WILL SAY THAT IN SOME

02:41:50.434 --> 02:41:56.006 region:rollup2
CASES WE KNOW.

02:41:52.169 --> 02:41:58.943 region:rollup2
THAT SOME FIRES RESULT IS IS.

02:41:56.006 --> 02:41:59.843 region:rollup2
FROM INAPPROPRIATE WERE POORLY

02:41:58.943 --> 02:42:03.614 region:rollup2
TELECOMMUNICATIONS

02:41:59.843 --> 02:42:05.583 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE ON A WOODEN POLE.

02:42:03.614 --> 02:42:07.985 region:rollup2
WE GENERALLY HOLD ELECTROCUTED

02:42:05.583 --> 02:42:09.153 region:rollup2
FOR MANAGING THAT BUT AS I SAID.

02:42:07.985 --> 02:42:10.521 region:rollup2
SOMETIMES THEY DO THE RIGHT

02:42:09.153 --> 02:42:12.590 region:rollup2
THING.

02:42:10.521 --> 02:42:14.692 region:rollup2
IN THESE OTHER UTILITIES DON'T

02:42:12.590 --> 02:42:16.660 region:rollup2
FOLLOW UP IN A TIMELY FASHION

02:42:14.692 --> 02:42:19.129 region:rollup2
I'VE SEEN BUDDY PULLS THOSE

02:42:16.660 --> 02:42:20.598 region:rollup2
POLLS WHERE THE ELECTRIC UTILITY

02:42:19.129 --> 02:42:22.299 region:rollup2
REPLACES THE PAUL.

02:42:20.598 --> 02:42:24.401 region:rollup2
BUT THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS

02:42:22.299 --> 02:42:26.670 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE PEOPLE DIDN'T

02:42:24.401 --> 02:42:27.972 region:rollup2
SHOW UP ON THE SAME DAY THEY

THE UTILITY CAN CONSUME.

02:43:02.172 --> 02:43:05.676 region:rollup2

OUR FIRE RISK.

02:47:21.365 --> 02:47:24.034 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE SOMETHING THAT YOU

02:47:22.299 --> 02:47:24.534 region:rollup2
WOULD RECOMMEND BE LOOKED AT FOR

02:47:24.034 --> 02:47:25.002 region:rollup2

VERY FIRST SENTENCE READS DOWNED

02:47:45.255 --> 02:47:48.892 region:rollup2
POWER LINES AND SPARKING

02:47:46.823 --> 02:47:50.127 region:rollup2
ELECTRIC.

02:47:48.892 --> 02:47:51.428 region:rollup2
ELECTRICAL EQUIPMENT IGNITED

02:47:50.127 --> 02:47:54.131 region:rollup2
MANY OF CALIFORNIA'S RECENT

02:47:51.428 --> 02:47:57.000 region:rollup2
DEVASTATING WILDFIRES.

02:47:54.131 --> 02:47:59.369 region:rollup2
WHAT IS THE METHODOLOGY WHAT IS

02:47:57.000 --> 02:48:00.804 region:rollup2
THE PROCESS OF DETERMINING THE

02:47:59.369 --> 02:48:05.208 region:rollup2
CAUSE OF A FIRE ONE OF THE

02:48:00.804 --> 02:48:06.410 region:rollup2
FACTORS YOU CONSIDERED?

02:48:05.208 --> 02:48:08.578 region:rollup2
REYES --

02:48:06.410 --> 02:48:12.783 region:rollup2
WHILE I AM NOT A CERTIFIED

02:48:08.578 --> 02:48:15.953 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATOR OF SUCH --

02:48:12.783 --> 02:48:17.421 region:rollup2
WHAT WE DO IS WE IDENTIFY

02:48:15.953 --> 02:48:20.824 region:rollup2
INDICATORS --

02:48:17.421 --> 02:48:22.259 region:rollup2
INITIALLY OF AFTER A FIRE BURNS

02:48:20.824 --> 02:48:23.393 region:rollup2
CERTAIN CHARACTERISTICS HAPPEN

02:48:22.259 --> 02:48:24.695 region:rollup2
TO DIFFERENT PLANETS AND

02:48:23.393 --> 02:48:26.663 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT --

02:48:24.695 --> 02:48:29.466 region:rollup2
ELEMENTS THAT ARE BURNED YOU CAN

02:48:26.663 --> 02:48:31.034 region:rollup2
IDENTIFY AND DIRECT BACK TO A

02:48:29.466 --> 02:48:32.402 region:rollup2
POINT OF ORIGIN SO WE'RE TRYING

02:48:31.034 --> 02:48:34.071 region:rollup2
TO DETERMINE WHAT THAT POINT OF

02:48:32.402 --> 02:48:36.306 region:rollup2
ORIGIN IS.

02:48:34.071 --> 02:48:38.375 region:rollup2
ONCE WE DETERMINED THAT THEN THE

02:48:36.306 --> 02:48:40.978 region:rollup2
POINT OF ORIGIN IS SEARCHED FOR

02:48:38.375 --> 02:48:43.313 region:rollup2
ANY POSSIBLE CAUSE FOR THAT --

02:48:40.978 --> 02:48:45.582 region:rollup2
AND THAT AND WE WE WEEK IT'S A

02:48:43.313 --> 02:48:47.551 region:rollup2
PROCESS OF ELIMINATION --

02:48:45.582 --> 02:48:48.885 region:rollup2
WE DETERMINE WHAT WAS NOT THE

02:48:47.551 --> 02:48:50.721 region:rollup2
CAUSE --

02:48:48.885 --> 02:48:52.222 region:rollup2
CHECK THOSE BOXES OFF UNTIL WE

02:48:50.721 --> 02:48:58.428 region:rollup2
GET -- TO

02:48:52.222 --> 02:48:59.062 region:rollup2
HANDFUL OR A POSSIBLE SINGLE.

02:48:58.428 --> 02:49:03.233 region:rollup2
THIS IS WHAT CAUSED THE FIRE --

02:48:59.062 --> 02:49:05.135 region:rollup2
IF THERE'S A DEVICE IN THERE IN

02:49:03.233 --> 02:49:07.571 region:rollup2
THE CASE OF AN ARSON --

02:49:05.135 --> 02:49:07.771 region:rollup2
THAT CAN BE IDENTIFIED OUT WOULD

02:49:07.571 --> 02:49:10.874 region:rollup2
BE --

02:49:07.771 --> 02:49:12.542 region:rollup2
BECAUSE SOMETIMES WE CAN'T FIND

02:49:10.874 --> 02:49:17.547 region:rollup2
THE CAR SOMETIME ME SO --

02:49:12.542 --> 02:49:20.017 region:rollup2
IT'S A ROADSIDE [inaudible]

02:49:17.547 --> 02:49:23.120 region:rollup2
ACTUAL.

02:49:20.017 --> 02:49:24.821 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THAT WE CAN IDENTIFY.

02:49:23.120 --> 02:49:27.691 region:rollup2
IT'S CLEAR THEM THAT IT IS A

02:49:24.821 --> 02:49:29.092 region:rollup2
VERY DETAILED PROCESS WHEN YOU

02:49:27.691 --> 02:49:30.794 region:rollup2
FIND.

02:49:29.092 --> 02:49:34.364 region:rollup2
OR WHEN YOU PUBLICLY STATE.

02:49:30.794 --> 02:49:36.099 region:rollup2
THAT AN ENTITY OR IT ARSONIST

02:49:34.364 --> 02:49:37.401 region:rollup2
HAS CAUSED THE FIRE.

02:49:36.099 --> 02:49:38.835 region:rollup2
YOU'VE GONE THROUGH QUITE A

02:49:37.401 --> 02:49:40.270 region:rollup2
PROCEDURE BEFORE YOU HAVE COME

02:49:38.835 --> 02:49:41.905 region:rollup2
TO THAT CONCLUSION.

02:49:40.270 --> 02:49:43.840 region:rollup2
THAT IS CORRECT [inaudible]

02:49:41.905 --> 02:49:46.643 region:rollup2
THANK YOU.

I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU HAVE.

02:49:52.315 --> 02:49:57.120 region:rollup2
THE VEGETATION MANAGEMENT

02:49:53.717 --> 02:49:58.388 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENTS YOU OF YOUR PLANS.

02:49:57.120 --> 02:50:09.066 region:rollup2
HOW OFTEN ARE THOSE VIOLATED BY

02:49:58.388 --> 02:50:11.501 region:rollup2
THE UTILITIES --

02:50:09.066 --> 02:50:14.304 region:rollup2
SO WE HAVE EXTENSIVE --

02:50:11.501 --> 02:50:15.672 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENTS FOR OVERHEAD AND ON

02:50:14.304 --> 02:50:18.041 region:rollup2
THE GROUND.

02:50:15.672 --> 02:50:20.944 region:rollup2
ELECTRIC EQUIPMENTS.

02:50:18.041 --> 02:50:24.247 region:rollup2
AND WE CONDUCT AUDIT AND

02:50:20.944 --> 02:50:25.916 region:rollup2
INCIDENTS INVESTIGATIONS --

02:50:24.247 --> 02:50:27.951 region:rollup2
THE FREQUENCY IS.

02:50:25.916 --> 02:50:31.288 region:rollup2
HOME.

02:50:27.951 --> 02:50:32.255 region:rollup2
IT REALLY RANGES EL IN TERMS ALL

02:50:31.288 --> 02:50:35.092 region:rollup2
OF THEM.

02:50:32.255 --> 02:50:37.360 region:rollup2
KHOMEINI EL VIOLATIONS WERE

02:50:35.092 --> 02:50:38.328 region:rollup2
POTENTIAL VIOLATIONS THERE ARE.

02:50:37.360 --> 02:50:41.064 region:rollup2
NO.

02:50:38.328 --> 02:50:44.067 region:rollup2
THEY ALSO RANGE IN THERE WELL

02:50:41.064 --> 02:50:46.336 region:rollup2
SEVERITY AND IMPACTS SO ON

02:50:44.067 --> 02:50:48.772 region:rollup2
SAFETY CERTAIN EXAMPLE OF THAT

02:50:46.336 --> 02:50:51.141 region:rollup2
I'D IS EVERY WELL PULL IS

02:50:48.772 --> 02:50:51.808 region:rollup2
REQUIRED TO HAVE A HIGH VOLTAGE

02:50:51.141 --> 02:50:54.344 region:rollup2
SIGN.

02:50:51.808 --> 02:50:56.580 region:rollup2
ALL ON ITS OWN THE FREQUENTLY

02:50:54.344 --> 02:50:57.948 region:rollup2
FALL OFF PEOPLE SOMETIMES LIKE

02:50:56.580 --> 02:50:59.216 region:rollup2
TO USE THEM AS TARGET PRACTICE

02:50:57.948 --> 02:51:00.450 region:rollup2
ALL KINDS OF THINGS.

02:50:59.216 --> 02:51:02.886 region:rollup2
SO IT CAN BE TECHNICALLY A

02:51:00.450 --> 02:51:05.055 region:rollup2
VIOLATION BUT IT'S A MISSILE IN

02:51:02.886 --> 02:51:06.323 region:rollup2
HIGH VOLTAGE SIGN IS NOT

02:51:05.055 --> 02:51:07.891 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO FOR

02:51:06.323 --> 02:51:08.492 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE SPARKED A FIRE.

02:51:07.891 --> 02:51:12.596 region:rollup2
SO IT'S THE DIFFICULT QUESTION

02:51:08.492 --> 02:51:15.932 region:rollup2
--

02:51:12.596 --> 02:51:18.235 region:rollup2
TO ANSWER IN TERMS OF L.

02:51:15.932 --> 02:51:21.004 region:rollup2
FREQUENCY.

02:51:18.235 --> 02:51:23.106 region:rollup2
HOME BUT IT'S THOUGH WE HAVE THE

02:51:21.004 --> 02:51:24.975 region:rollup2
EL.

02:51:23.106 --> 02:51:27.778 region:rollup2
IN THE EXTENT SO --

02:51:24.975 --> 02:51:29.546 region:rollup2
PROGRAM TO LOOK FOR WELL

02:51:27.778 --> 02:51:31.148 region:rollup2
VIOLATIONS OF POTENTIAL

02:51:29.546 --> 02:51:33.283 region:rollup2
VIOLATIONS AND ENSURE.

02:51:31.148 --> 02:51:35.152 region:rollup2
THAT UTILITIES CORRECT THE HOME

02:51:33.283 --> 02:51:36.920 region:rollup2
AND IN CASES WHEN THEY DO NOT

02:51:35.152 --> 02:51:41.224 region:rollup2
THAT WE SEEK UP ENFORCEMENT

02:51:36.920 --> 02:51:43.660 region:rollup2
ACTIONS.

02:51:41.224 --> 02:51:46.730 region:rollup2
HOW WOULD YOU ASSESS THE STRAIN

02:51:43.660 --> 02:51:48.965 region:rollup2
THEM THE EFFECTIVENESS?

02:51:46.730 --> 02:51:51.434 region:rollup2
OF YOUR CURRENT STANDARDS.

02:51:48.965 --> 02:51:53.036 region:rollup2
IF IF YOU SAY HERE'S A PLAN THEN

02:51:51.434 --> 02:51:54.404 region:rollup2
HERE'S WHAT YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO

02:51:53.036 --> 02:51:56.907 region:rollup2
DO IT ISN'T DONE.

02:51:54.404 --> 02:52:00.810 region:rollup2
GIVE THEM FIND THE UTILITIES BUT

02:51:56.907 --> 02:52:02.946 region:rollup2
HOW EFFECTIVE IS THAT.

02:52:00.810 --> 02:52:06.183 region:rollup2
YEAH HER HISTORY IS AS ECONOMIC

02:52:02.946 --> 02:52:08.285 region:rollup2
REGULATOR AND SO WHEN WHEN WE

02:52:06.183 --> 02:52:09.886 region:rollup2
GET TO SAFETY WE FREQUENTLY USE

02:52:08.285 --> 02:52:11.621 region:rollup2
THE SAME KINDS OF TOOLS SO WE'LL

02:52:09.886 --> 02:52:13.490 region:rollup2
DO AUDITS.

02:52:11.621 --> 02:52:16.193 region:rollup2
AND THEN WE'LL DO SPOT CHECKS TO

02:52:13.490 --> 02:52:18.195 region:rollup2
MAKE SURE THAT THE THAT THE

02:52:16.193 --> 02:52:19.729 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS THAT THE UTILITY HAS IN

02:52:18.195 --> 02:52:21.464 region:rollup2
PLACE IN THE REPORTS THEY HAVE

02:52:19.729 --> 02:52:23.466 region:rollup2
ON THEIR THEIR ACTIVITIES

02:52:21.464 --> 02:52:24.835 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY MATCH UP.

02:52:23.466 --> 02:52:27.470 region:rollup2
TO TO WHAT WE SEE WHEN WE GO OUT

02:52:24.835 --> 02:52:29.472 region:rollup2
AND DO THOSE THE SPOT CHECKS.

02:52:27.470 --> 02:52:30.841 region:rollup2
WHO FREE CALL WE DO THAT BASED

02:52:29.472 --> 02:52:31.441 region:rollup2
ON -- THE

02:52:30.841 --> 02:52:33.343 region:rollup2
THE KIND OF A INDUSTRY RAIL IS

02:52:31.441 --> 02:52:36.179 region:rollup2
--

02:52:33.343 --> 02:52:37.547 region:rollup2
IT WE WERE REQUIRED BY LAW TO DO

02:52:36.179 --> 02:52:39.382 region:rollup2
A MUCH DIFFERENT KIND OF

02:52:37.547 --> 02:52:41.084 region:rollup2
INSPECTION PROCESS AND WE DO

02:52:39.382 --> 02:52:43.520 region:rollup2
WITH FOUR MILLION POLLS.

02:52:41.084 --> 02:52:44.821 region:rollup2
SO FRANKLY I THINK THAT ONE OF

02:52:43.520 --> 02:52:45.922 region:rollup2
THE THINGS WE'RE PROBABLY GONNA

02:52:44.821 --> 02:52:47.724 region:rollup2
HAVE TO DO START TO RELY AND

02:52:45.922 --> 02:52:49.426 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGY.

02:52:47.724 --> 02:52:51.061 region:rollup2
SO OUR REALIST BACKERS FOR

02:52:49.426 --> 02:52:52.562 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE GO OUT EVERY YEAR HE

02:52:51.061 --> 02:52:54.097 region:rollup2
LOOK AT EVERY FOOT OF TRACK AND

02:52:52.562 --> 02:52:55.966 region:rollup2
THE CARRY LITTLE MIRROR SO THEY

02:52:54.097 --> 02:52:56.499 region:rollup2
CAN LOOK AT THE UNDERSIDE OF THE

02:52:55.966 --> 02:52:58.068 region:rollup2
TRACK TO SEE IF THERE ARE

02:52:56.499 --> 02:52:59.970 region:rollup2
CRACKS.

02:52:58.068 --> 02:53:01.638 region:rollup2
ARE DE FEDERAL RAILWAY

02:52:59.970 --> 02:53:03.139 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION HAS A HIGH TECH

02:53:01.638 --> 02:53:05.242 region:rollup2
LOCOMOTIVES THEY CAN ACTUALLY

02:53:03.139 --> 02:53:08.111 region:rollup2
ROLL THAT SAME TRACK.

02:53:05.242 --> 02:53:09.646 region:rollup2
DUE TO THREE TIMES A YEAR AND

02:53:08.111 --> 02:53:12.182 region:rollup2
TAKES IMAGING.

02:53:09.646 --> 02:53:14.551 region:rollup2
SOPHISTICATED ELECTRO --

02:53:12.182 --> 02:53:15.418 region:rollup2
MAGNETIC IMAGING THAT CAN DETECT

02:53:14.551 --> 02:53:17.454 region:rollup2
THE CRACKS IN THE LOGO I DO THIS

02:53:15.418 --> 02:53:19.122 region:rollup2
INSPECTION.

02:53:17.454 --> 02:53:20.724 region:rollup2
I THINK WHEN IT COMES TO REALLY

02:53:19.122 --> 02:53:21.825 region:rollup2
MONITORING THESE BROTHERS WE

02:53:20.724 --> 02:53:24.127 region:rollup2
HAVE TO GET TO THE POINT WHERE

02:53:21.825 --> 02:53:25.762 region:rollup2
WE HAVE DRONES WITH WHITE ARE.

02:53:24.127 --> 02:53:26.863 region:rollup2
THE GENIE IS CURRENTLY USING TO

02:53:25.762 --> 02:53:28.398 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY MANAGE SOME OF THEIR

02:53:26.863 --> 02:53:30.333 region:rollup2
VEGETATION.

02:53:28.398 --> 02:53:32.002 region:rollup2
AND THEN PATTERN RECOGNITION

02:53:30.333 --> 02:53:33.136 region:rollup2
SOFTWARE SO THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY

02:53:32.002 --> 02:53:35.138 region:rollup2
LOOK AT THE EQUIPMENT SIGN THAT

02:53:33.136 --> 02:53:36.606 region:rollup2
PULL AND THEY RELATE IT BACK TO

02:53:35.138 --> 02:53:37.607 region:rollup2
THAT DATABASE FOR TRYING TO BILL

02:53:36.606 --> 02:53:39.876 region:rollup2
TO UNDERSTAND.

02:53:37.607 --> 02:53:41.378 region:rollup2
WHO IS SUPPOSED TO BE THERE AND

02:53:39.876 --> 02:53:42.746 region:rollup2
IF SOMETHING SHOWS UP THAT'S NOT

02:53:41.378 --> 02:53:44.981 region:rollup2
THERE IN THE DATE PATTERN

02:53:42.746 --> 02:53:46.016 region:rollup2
RECOGNITION SOFTWARE --

02:53:44.981 --> 02:53:47.984 region:rollup2
DOESN'T RECOGNIZE.

02:53:46.016 --> 02:53:49.486 region:rollup2
BUT THIS IS A CHALLENGE FOR

02:53:47.984 --> 02:53:50.687 region:rollup2
STATE GOVERNMENT --

02:53:49.486 --> 02:53:53.490 region:rollup2
TO ACTUALLY USE TECHNOLOGY ON

02:53:50.687 --> 02:53:55.859 region:rollup2
THAT LEVEL AND PARTICULARLY TO

02:53:53.490 --> 02:53:58.662 region:rollup2
START DE TO GET TO THAT HIGH

02:53:55.859 --> 02:53:59.996 region:rollup2
LEVEL OF ALMOST ARTIFICIAL

02:53:58.662 --> 02:54:02.232 region:rollup2
INTELLIGENCE TO DO THE

02:53:59.996 --> 02:54:03.733 region:rollup2
RECOGNITION OF BOTH OF THE

02:54:02.232 --> 02:54:06.469 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE WHAT'S ON IT.

02:54:03.733 --> 02:54:07.103 region:rollup2
AND VEGETATION.

02:54:06.469 --> 02:54:08.138 region:rollup2
BUT I THINK THAT'S THE DIRECTION

02:54:07.103 --> 02:54:09.673 region:rollup2
THEY WERE HEADED.

02:54:08.138 --> 02:54:12.042 region:rollup2
IF THIS IS SOMETHING YOU FEEL

02:54:09.673 --> 02:54:14.044 region:rollup2
WOULD BE HELPFUL HOUSE THAT

02:54:12.042 --> 02:54:15.945 region:rollup2
PROPOSAL BEEN MADE.

02:54:14.044 --> 02:54:18.048 region:rollup2
JUST FORCED BUDGET AS SOON AS I

02:54:15.945 --> 02:54:19.049 region:rollup2
SAW THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL I

02:54:18.048 --> 02:54:20.717 region:rollup2
THOUGHT THAT'S WHERE WE HAVE TO

02:54:19.049 --> 02:54:21.885 region:rollup2
GO.

02:54:20.717 --> 02:54:23.153 region:rollup2
BUT I THINK THAT IS GOING TO BE

02:54:21.885 --> 02:54:24.487 region:rollup2
A BUILDING PROCESS.

02:54:23.153 --> 02:54:26.456 region:rollup2
THIS YOU WELL KNOW.

02:54:24.487 --> 02:54:28.858 region:rollup2
AGENCIES DON'T GET TO MAKE THOSE

02:54:26.456 --> 02:54:30.427 region:rollup2
DECISIONS ARE ON THEIR OWN THEY

02:54:28.858 --> 02:54:31.861 region:rollup2
HAVE TO GO THROUGH CAL I. T.. TO

02:54:30.427 --> 02:54:33.463 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY GET PERMISSION TO

02:54:31.861 --> 02:54:35.765 region:rollup2
DEVELOP THINKS I HAVE A NAP ON

02:54:33.463 --> 02:54:36.032 region:rollup2
MY PHONE THAT WE THAT WE

02:54:35.765 --> 02:54:38.868 region:rollup2
DEVELOPED.

02:54:36.032 --> 02:54:39.769 region:rollup2
AT CPUC SO PEOPLE COULD TAKE A

02:54:38.868 --> 02:54:41.504 region:rollup2
PICTURE.

02:54:39.769 --> 02:54:44.307 region:rollup2
OF A POLL VIOLATION AND WOOD

02:54:41.504 --> 02:54:45.809 region:rollup2
AUTOMATICALLY UPLOAD --

02:54:44.307 --> 02:54:48.244 region:rollup2
TO TO THE CPUC.

02:54:45.809 --> 02:54:50.880 region:rollup2
BUT WE CANNOT GET.

02:54:48.244 --> 02:54:53.083 region:rollup2
KIND OF DATABASE AND THE SERVERS

02:54:50.880 --> 02:54:54.918 region:rollup2
THAT WE NEED TO ACTUALLY MANAGE

02:54:53.083 --> 02:54:56.586 region:rollup2
THOSE THINGS AND BEGIN TO TURN

02:54:54.918 --> 02:54:58.488 region:rollup2
IT INTO AN ENFORCEMENT TOOL.

02:54:56.586 --> 02:54:59.222 region:rollup2
BUT YOU ALREADY KNOW FOR SURE

02:54:58.488 --> 02:55:01.658 region:rollup2
THAT THERE ARE MANY.

02:54:59.222 --> 02:55:02.993 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENTS.

02:55:01.658 --> 02:55:04.894 region:rollup2
THAT HAVE BEEN IN MANY PLANS

02:55:02.993 --> 02:55:06.229 region:rollup2
THAT HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED WHERE

02:55:04.894 --> 02:55:08.398 region:rollup2
THEY HAVE NOT BEEN COMPLIED WITH

02:55:06.229 --> 02:55:09.499 region:rollup2
WE ALREADY KNOW THAT.

02:55:08.398 --> 02:55:10.700 region:rollup2
CORRECT.

02:55:09.499 --> 02:55:12.469 region:rollup2
AND THAT THE UTILITIES ALREADY

02:55:10.700 --> 02:55:13.536 region:rollup2
BEEN FINED.

02:55:12.469 --> 02:55:14.938 region:rollup2
AND EVEN AFTER THEY'RE FINE

02:55:13.536 --> 02:55:17.040 region:rollup2
THEY'RE STILL NOT CORRECTING IT

02:55:14.938 --> 02:55:19.209 region:rollup2
IS THAT STILL HAPPENING.

02:55:17.040 --> 02:55:21.611 region:rollup2
WE GENERALLY OF A MIDDLE

02:55:19.209 --> 02:55:24.047 region:rollup2
DEFERRED TO TO TO KNOW HE'S VERY

02:55:21.611 --> 02:55:25.582 region:rollup2
WE DO NOTICES OF VIOLATION WE

02:55:24.047 --> 02:55:26.616 region:rollup2
DON'T HAVE THAT CITATION

02:55:25.582 --> 02:55:29.352 region:rollup2
AUTHORITY FOR THE TELCO

02:55:26.616 --> 02:55:30.286 region:rollup2
COMPANIES HOWEVER SO IT REALLY

02:55:29.352 --> 02:55:32.589 region:rollup2
IS A MUCH MORE DIFFICULT.

02:55:30.286 --> 02:55:34.424 region:rollup2
KIND OF A PROCESS SO WE'RE

02:55:32.589 --> 02:55:35.959 region:rollup2
TRYING TO DEVELOP --

02:55:34.424 --> 02:55:37.627 region:rollup2
THE THE TOOLS THAT WE NEED TO

02:55:35.959 --> 02:55:39.195 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY GET THE OTHER UTILITIES

02:55:37.627 --> 02:55:40.196 region:rollup2
UNDER COMPLIANCE.

02:55:39.195 --> 02:55:41.965 region:rollup2
BUT I THINK THERE WILL WE FIND

02:55:40.196 --> 02:55:43.867 region:rollup2
OF VEGETATION MANAGEMENT ISSUE

02:55:41.965 --> 02:55:44.801 region:rollup2
WE REQUIRE CORRECTION.

02:55:43.867 --> 02:55:46.403 region:rollup2
AND IF THERE ISN'T SPEEDY

02:55:44.801 --> 02:55:47.871 region:rollup2
CORRECTION WE TRIED ESCALATED TO

02:55:46.403 --> 02:55:50.206 region:rollup2
CITATION.

02:55:47.871 --> 02:55:50.673 region:rollup2
CITATION IF WE FIND A PATTERN

02:55:50.206 --> 02:55:52.475 region:rollup2
THEN WE MOVE IT TO AN

02:55:50.673 --> 02:55:54.744 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATION.

02:55:52.475 --> 02:55:56.012 region:rollup2
BUT LIKE A LOT OF ENFORCEMENT.

02:55:54.744 --> 02:55:58.014 region:rollup2
DO YOU ACT WHEN LIGHTNING

02:55:56.012 --> 02:56:02.051 region:rollup2
STRIKES.

02:55:58.014 --> 02:56:03.920 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW IT'S NOT LIKE EVERY.

02:56:02.051 --> 02:56:05.255 region:rollup2
POLICE DEPARTMENT KNOWS EVERY

02:56:03.920 --> 02:56:07.424 region:rollup2
DRUG TRANSACTION WAS TAKING

02:56:05.255 --> 02:56:08.358 region:rollup2
PLACE.

02:56:07.424 --> 02:56:09.859 region:rollup2
SOMETIMES IN THE CATCH PEOPLE IN

02:56:08.358 --> 02:56:11.628 region:rollup2
THE LIVE.

02:56:09.859 --> 02:56:13.663 region:rollup2
SO I'M JUST SAYING THAT WITH

02:56:11.628 --> 02:56:14.631 region:rollup2
FOUR MILLION POLES MILLIONS OF

02:56:13.663 --> 02:56:16.099 region:rollup2
MILES.

02:56:14.631 --> 02:56:19.669 region:rollup2
OF PHONE.

02:56:16.099 --> 02:56:21.404 region:rollup2
FILE WIRES AND AND MILLIONS AND

02:56:19.669 --> 02:56:23.473 region:rollup2
MILLIONS OF TREES WHO.

02:56:21.404 --> 02:56:25.675 region:rollup2
THE THE EXPENDITURE AND THE

02:56:23.473 --> 02:56:26.176 region:rollup2
AMOUNT OF OF HUMAN LABOR THAT IT

02:56:25.675 --> 02:56:27.911 region:rollup2
WOULD TAKE TO DO THAT IS

02:56:26.176 --> 02:56:30.180 region:rollup2
EXTREME.

02:56:27.911 --> 02:56:32.082 region:rollup2
P. GENIE FOR EXAMPLE HAS THIRTY

02:56:30.180 --> 02:56:34.050 region:rollup2
FIVE THOUSAND EMPLOYEES.

02:56:32.082 --> 02:56:36.119 region:rollup2
THE PGA THE PUBLIC UTILITIES

02:56:34.050 --> 02:56:36.719 region:rollup2
COMMISSION HAS ELEVEN TWELVE

02:56:36.119 --> 02:56:37.821 region:rollup2
HUNDRED EMPLOYEES RIGHT ABOUT

02:56:36.719 --> 02:56:39.923 region:rollup2
NOW.

02:56:37.821 --> 02:56:42.692 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S SPLIT ACROSS A WHOLE

02:56:39.923 --> 02:56:44.928 region:rollup2
RANGE OF DIFFERENT PROGRAMS SO

02:56:42.692 --> 02:56:46.463 region:rollup2
TO ACTUALLY MATCH THAT KIND OF

02:56:44.928 --> 02:56:48.298 region:rollup2
INSPECTION CAPABILITY.

02:56:46.463 --> 02:56:48.832 region:rollup2
WILL BE A CHALLENGE FOR US SO IN

02:56:48.298 --> 02:56:51.034 region:rollup2
THE MEANTIME WE DEPEND ON

02:56:48.832 --> 02:56:52.402 region:rollup2
AUDITS.

02:56:51.034 --> 02:56:53.937 region:rollup2
OR EVEN IN YOUR AUDIT SO YOU'RE

02:56:52.402 --> 02:56:56.272 region:rollup2
FINDING THAT THE COMPLIANCE IS

02:56:53.937 --> 02:56:57.607 region:rollup2
NOT THERE.

02:56:56.272 --> 02:56:59.275 region:rollup2
IS THAT CORRECT DO YOU GENERALLY

02:56:57.607 --> 02:57:01.411 region:rollup2
DON'T FIND COMPLIANCE IN ANY

02:56:59.275 --> 02:57:03.413 region:rollup2
PROGRAM TO BE PERFECT.

02:57:01.411 --> 02:57:04.848 region:rollup2
AND SO WHAT YOU NEED NOT NOT.

02:57:03.413 --> 02:57:06.216 region:rollup2
EXCUSE ME FOR INTERRUPTING SORRY

02:57:04.848 --> 02:57:07.350 region:rollup2
I'M NOT ASKING ABOUT PERFECTION

02:57:06.216 --> 02:57:09.686 region:rollup2
I KNOW YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT THAT

02:57:07.350 --> 02:57:10.854 region:rollup2
RESPONSE JUST SO WE ARE

02:57:09.686 --> 02:57:13.356 region:rollup2
ESCALATING AT OWN FORCED NOBODY.

02:57:10.854 --> 02:57:14.791 region:rollup2
I DON'T THINK ANYBODY.

02:57:13.356 --> 02:57:17.794 region:rollup2
WOULD REQUIRE PERFECTION BUT I

02:57:14.791 --> 02:57:19.629 region:rollup2
THINK THAT HAVING A RESPONSE IT

02:57:17.794 --> 02:57:21.097 region:rollup2
IF SOMEONE IS NOT IN COMPLIANCE

02:57:19.629 --> 02:57:22.632 region:rollup2
AND YOU YOU THEN.

02:57:21.097 --> 02:57:24.167 region:rollup2
ARE GOING TO FIND THEM

02:57:22.632 --> 02:57:26.402 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL NOW

02:57:24.167 --> 02:57:28.404 region:rollup2
INCREASES THE PENALTIES

02:57:26.402 --> 02:57:30.206 region:rollup2
SUBSTANTIALLY.

02:57:28.404 --> 02:57:31.708 region:rollup2
AND PART OF THAT IS BECAUSE IF

02:57:30.206 --> 02:57:34.077 region:rollup2
THE PENALTIES THAT DO YOU OR

02:57:31.708 --> 02:57:35.979 region:rollup2
HAVE THE CAPABILITY TO A CELLS

02:57:34.077 --> 02:57:37.580 region:rollup2
ARE NOT ENOUGH TO GET THE

02:57:35.979 --> 02:57:39.148 region:rollup2
CORRECTIVE ACTION.

02:57:37.580 --> 02:57:40.950 region:rollup2
THAT PERHAPS YOU NEED MORE OF A

02:57:39.148 --> 02:57:43.586 region:rollup2
PENALTY IS THAT GOING TO BE OF

02:57:40.950 --> 02:57:45.121 region:rollup2
HELP TO YOU.

02:57:43.586 --> 02:57:46.823 region:rollup2
I THINK IT WILL.

02:57:45.121 --> 02:57:48.491 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT WE'VE BEEN TOLD BY

02:57:46.823 --> 02:57:51.828 region:rollup2
FEDERAL AGENCIES FOR EXAMPLE IN

02:57:48.491 --> 02:57:53.496 region:rollup2
GAS --

02:57:51.828 --> 02:57:56.366 region:rollup2
PIPELINE MANAGEMENT THERE ARE

02:57:53.496 --> 02:57:57.867 region:rollup2
ARE ARE PENALTIES ARE UNDER WHAT

02:57:56.366 --> 02:57:59.502 region:rollup2
THEY EXPECT THEM TO BE.

02:57:57.867 --> 02:58:01.371 region:rollup2
BUT THOSE LEVELS ARE SET BY THE

02:57:59.502 --> 02:58:02.705 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE SO WE'VE ACTUALLY

02:58:01.371 --> 02:58:04.274 region:rollup2
ASKED ABOUT RAISING THOSE A

02:58:02.705 --> 02:58:06.843 region:rollup2
NUMBER OF TIMES.

02:58:04.274 --> 02:58:07.944 region:rollup2
I SUSPECT TO BE HONEST WITH YOU

02:58:06.843 --> 02:58:09.579 region:rollup2
THAT THERE WILL BE A LOT OF

02:58:07.944 --> 02:58:10.813 region:rollup2
OPPOSITION TO INCREASING THE

02:58:09.579 --> 02:58:12.615 region:rollup2
PENALTIES BECAUSE WE WOULD APPLY

02:58:10.813 --> 02:58:14.417 region:rollup2
THOSE THE TELEPHONE COMPANIES AS

02:58:12.615 --> 02:58:15.618 region:rollup2
WELL SO THE ELECTRICAL COME.

02:58:14.417 --> 02:58:17.654 region:rollup2
I WOULD BE VERY SURPRISED IF

02:58:15.618 --> 02:58:19.856 region:rollup2
THERE ISN'T DUH CONCERN ON THE

02:58:17.654 --> 02:58:20.957 region:rollup2
PART OF THESE OTHER UTILITIES.

02:58:19.856 --> 02:58:23.760 region:rollup2
OKAY SAID THEY IT'S TO

02:58:20.957 --> 02:58:24.761 region:rollup2
ABSOLUTELY TRUE THAT THE TELCOS

02:58:23.760 --> 02:58:26.696 region:rollup2
HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN WILL

02:58:24.761 --> 02:58:28.765 region:rollup2
FAILURES.

02:58:26.696 --> 02:58:31.301 region:rollup2
AND THEN MY LAST.

02:58:28.765 --> 02:58:32.168 region:rollup2
QUESTION MORE MORE SO COMMENT.

02:58:31.301 --> 02:58:34.070 region:rollup2
WHEN --

02:58:32.168 --> 02:58:37.373 region:rollup2
ASSEMBLY MEMBER WOULD WAS ASKING

02:58:34.070 --> 02:58:38.575 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE PROCEDURE AND EIGHTEEN

02:58:37.373 --> 02:58:40.310 region:rollup2
MONTHS AND STILL.

02:58:38.575 --> 02:58:40.610 region:rollup2
NOTHING HAS HAPPENED

02:58:40.310 --> 02:58:42.979 region:rollup2
[inaudible]

02:58:40.610 --> 02:58:44.714 region:rollup2
IT.

02:58:42.979 --> 02:58:45.748 region:rollup2
I REALIZE THAT THE YOUR COMMENT

02:58:44.714 --> 02:58:47.016 region:rollup2
YOUR RESPONSE WAS THE

02:58:45.748 --> 02:58:48.284 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE'S ONE SETS THE

02:58:47.016 --> 02:58:49.586 region:rollup2
STANDARD.

02:58:48.284 --> 02:58:51.554 region:rollup2
IF THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH

02:58:49.586 --> 02:58:53.690 region:rollup2
SOMETHING.

02:58:51.554 --> 02:58:55.525 region:rollup2
WE WOULD LOOK TO YOU TO TELL US

02:58:53.690 --> 02:58:58.628 region:rollup2
WHAT NEEDS TO BE CORRECTED.

02:58:55.525 --> 02:59:00.663 region:rollup2
OR CHANGED SO SOMETHING IS

02:58:58.628 --> 02:59:03.666 region:rollup2
HOLDING UP THE PROCESS WERE

02:59:00.663 --> 02:59:05.602 region:rollup2
EXPECTING IT TO BE. TO TAKE WILL

02:59:03.666 --> 02:59:06.936 region:rollup2
WHO RUN ITS COURSE AND COME UP

02:59:05.602 --> 02:59:08.705 region:rollup2
WITH EVERITT DOES SOLUTION AT

02:59:06.936 --> 02:59:10.473 region:rollup2
THE END IF THERE IS SOMETHING

02:59:08.705 --> 02:59:11.441 region:rollup2
THAT IS CAUSING A PROBLEM OR

02:59:10.473 --> 02:59:14.210 region:rollup2
CAUSING.

02:59:11.441 --> 02:59:15.411 region:rollup2
THE PROCESS TO SLOW.

02:59:14.210 --> 02:59:16.679 region:rollup2
THIS DOESN'T EVEN SOUND LIKE

02:59:15.411 --> 02:59:19.315 region:rollup2
IT'S SLOWING DOWN SOUNDS LIKE

02:59:16.679 --> 02:59:21.084 region:rollup2
IT'S ALMOST STOPPED.

02:59:19.315 --> 02:59:22.719 region:rollup2
I DON'T I TRULY I WOULD

02:59:21.084 --> 02:59:24.587 region:rollup2
ABSOLUTELY I DID I WOULD

02:59:22.719 --> 02:59:25.622 region:rollup2
PERSONALLY SAY WE WOULD ALL I

02:59:24.587 --> 02:59:27.824 region:rollup2
WOULD WANT TO HEAR FROM YOU

02:59:25.622 --> 02:59:30.293 region:rollup2
ABOUT WHAT NEEDS TO BE CHANGED

02:59:27.824 --> 02:59:33.162 region:rollup2
SO THAT WE CAN THEN LOOK TO SEE.

02:59:30.293 --> 02:59:34.330 region:rollup2
WHAT WE DO TO HELP YOU DO THE

02:59:33.162 --> 02:59:35.765 region:rollup2
JOB THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE BY THE

02:59:34.330 --> 02:59:37.500 region:rollup2
P. YOU SEE?

02:59:35.765 --> 02:59:39.936 region:rollup2
ABSOLUTELY WE RAISED A LOT OF

02:59:37.500 --> 02:59:41.537 region:rollup2
THESE ISSUES AND REFORM BILLS OF

02:59:39.936 --> 02:59:43.206 region:rollup2
SEVERAL YEARS AGO.

02:59:41.537 --> 02:59:45.208 region:rollup2
SENATOR HILL ACTUALLY --

02:59:43.206 --> 02:59:47.377 region:rollup2
RESPONDED ON ON ONE OF THOSE

02:59:45.208 --> 02:59:50.947 region:rollup2
ISSUES AND GAVE US A A PROCESS

02:59:47.377 --> 02:59:51.447 region:rollup2
TO BEGIN IN LINE ON ONE OF OUR

02:59:50.947 --> 02:59:53.049 region:rollup2
THREE DIFFERENT TYPES OF

02:59:51.447 --> 02:59:55.051 region:rollup2
PROCEEDINGS.

02:59:53.049 --> 02:59:56.819 region:rollup2
SO WE'RE TRYING TO TO PERFECT

02:59:55.051 --> 02:59:58.888 region:rollup2
THE I DON'T KNOW LAW WHICH THAT

02:59:56.819 --> 03:00:00.156 region:rollup2
WOULD INCLUDE WHAT CATEGORY THIS

02:59:58.888 --> 03:00:02.625 region:rollup2
SPECIFIC --

03:00:00.156 --> 03:00:03.359 region:rollup2
ON TWEAK THE YOU WANTED TO MAKE

03:00:02.625 --> 03:00:04.627 region:rollup2
FELL.

03:00:03.359 --> 03:00:06.229 region:rollup2
BUT I'LL JUST SAY THAT YOU KNOW

03:00:04.627 --> 03:00:07.930 region:rollup2
WHEN YOU HAVE.

03:00:06.229 --> 03:00:09.932 region:rollup2
A SETTING WHERE EVERYBODY HAS

03:00:07.930 --> 03:00:11.801 region:rollup2
THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE A VOICE

03:00:09.932 --> 03:00:14.504 region:rollup2
AND EQUAL VOICE BEFORE A

03:00:11.801 --> 03:00:15.938 region:rollup2
DECISION MAKER.

03:00:14.504 --> 03:00:17.206 region:rollup2
DEMOCRACY IS THE GOAL OF

03:00:15.938 --> 03:00:20.276 region:rollup2
DEMOCRACY HAS NEVER BEEN

03:00:17.206 --> 03:00:22.879 region:rollup2
EFFICIENCY AND SPEED.

03:00:20.276 --> 03:00:24.547 region:rollup2
BUT DEMOCRACY ALSO REQUIRES THAT

03:00:22.879 --> 03:00:25.882 region:rollup2
WE COME TO A SOLUTION AND IF

03:00:24.547 --> 03:00:28.484 region:rollup2
WE'RE NOT ABLE TO COME TO A

03:00:25.882 --> 03:00:29.919 region:rollup2
SOLUTION THE WE HAVE TO FIX.

03:00:28.484 --> 03:00:31.754 region:rollup2
A PROCESS WHICH STILL HAVE

03:00:29.919 --> 03:00:33.089 region:rollup2
DEMOCRACY AND WE'RE NOT GOING TO

03:00:31.754 --> 03:00:34.957 region:rollup2
CHANGE THAT BUT IF THERE'S A

03:00:33.089 --> 03:00:36.859 region:rollup2
PROBLEM WITH THE PROCESS WE'VE

03:00:34.957 --> 03:00:37.860 region:rollup2
GOT TO FIX THE PROCESS SO WE

03:00:36.859 --> 03:00:39.696 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY DO.

03:00:37.860 --> 03:00:41.531 region:rollup2
GET DEMOCRACY WILL BE HAPPY TO

03:00:39.696 --> 03:00:42.398 region:rollup2
WORK WITH YOUR OFFICE TO GO OVER

03:00:41.531 --> 03:00:44.801 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE PROPOSALS THAT

03:00:42.398 --> 03:00:46.369 region:rollup2
REJECTED BY IN THE LEGISLATURE

03:00:44.801 --> 03:00:49.772 region:rollup2
LAST TIME AROUND I LOOK FORWARD.

03:00:46.369 --> 03:00:52.041 region:rollup2
TO SO THERE WERE SOME.

03:00:49.772 --> 03:00:53.676 region:rollup2
THANK YOU EN.

TODAY AND IN AND RAISE SOME OF

03:00:56.946 --> 03:01:00.149 region:rollup2
THESE CONCERNS I THINK THAT I

03:00:58.381 --> 03:01:01.184 region:rollup2
THINK FOR THE NEXT STEP.

03:01:00.149 --> 03:01:02.919 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW I'D LIKE TO SEE US

03:01:01.184 --> 03:01:05.088 region:rollup2

COMMITTEE INTENDS TO WORK ON AND

03:01:05.088 --> 03:01:08.658 region:rollup2
REALLY BRING THOSE SOLUTIONS THE

03:01:07.457 --> 03:01:10.126 region:rollup2
FOREFRONT HAVE THOSE BE

03:01:08.658 --> 03:01:11.961 region:rollup2
DISCUSSED BECAUSE I MEAN.

03:01:10.126 --> 03:01:14.397 region:rollup2
WEEK THAT AS AS MISTER WAR A

INTO WHERE WE BILL HOW WE BUILD

03:01:23.106 --> 03:01:26.976 region:rollup2

REQUIRED OF THE UTILITIES IN

03:01:29.479 --> 03:01:31.881 region:rollup2
TERMS OF WHAT POLLS WERE GOING

03:01:31.247 --> 03:01:33.249 region:rollup2

OF THE STATE.

03:01:53.770 --> 03:01:56.906 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU CONSIDER

03:01:55.138 --> 03:01:58.841 region:rollup2
THAT.

03:01:56.906 --> 03:02:00.910 region:rollup2
ENGINEERING WISE THE

03:01:58.841 --> 03:02:03.446 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS TODAY

THAT NECESSITATE.

03:02:09.285 --> 03:02:12.054 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT KIND OF WIRES

03:02:10.286 --> 03:02:14.424 region:rollup2

TODAY I MEAN I I CAN I CAN ASK

03:02:17.426 --> 03:02:21.130 region:rollup2
VERY SPECIFIC QUESTIONS.

03:02:19.829 --> 03:02:22.632 region:rollup2
ON ON MANY OF THE DIFFERENT

03:02:21.130 --> 03:02:24.500 region:rollup2
PRESENTATION BUT IN THE END WHAT

03:02:22.632 --> 03:02:25.868 region:rollup2
WHAT WE I THINK WHAT WE'RE GOING

03:02:24.500 --> 03:02:27.470 region:rollup2
TO NEED US LEGISLATURE.

03:02:25.868 --> 03:02:29.672 region:rollup2
MISTER BEGIN THE FOCUS ON THE

03:02:27.470 --> 03:02:31.240 region:rollup2
MOST URGENT.

03:02:29.672 --> 03:02:33.142 region:rollup2
ISSUES I I UNDERSTAND BIOMASS

03:02:31.240 --> 03:02:34.577 region:rollup2
PLANTS.

03:02:33.142 --> 03:02:35.077 region:rollup2
AND HOW THEY CAN BE AN IMPORTANT

03:02:34.577 --> 03:02:37.313 region:rollup2
SOURCE OF A SOLVING THIS

03:02:35.077 --> 03:02:38.748 region:rollup2
PROBLEM.

03:02:37.313 --> 03:02:40.616 region:rollup2
BUT IT'S NOT THE CHEAPEST WAY TO

03:02:38.748 --> 03:02:42.552 region:rollup2
MANAGE.

03:02:40.616 --> 03:02:44.053 region:rollup2
BRUSH AND WHEN YOU'RE TALKING

ABOUT A HUNDRED TWENTY NINE

03:02:44.053 --> 03:02:47.190 region:rollup2
MILLION DEAD TREES BECAUSE JUST

03:02:45.888 --> 03:02:49.625 region:rollup2
BY THE DROUGHT [inaudible]

03:02:47.190 --> 03:02:50.960 region:rollup2
THAT WAS.

03:02:49.625 --> 03:02:52.395 region:rollup2
THAT'S JUST IN THE SIERRA HIGH

03:02:50.960 --> 03:02:53.996 region:rollup2
FOR US THAT IS THAT DOESN'T

03:02:52.395 --> 03:02:56.666 region:rollup2
COVER THE WILD OAK WOODLAND

03:02:53.996 --> 03:02:58.034 region:rollup2
PROBLEM OR DIE MANAGEMENT AND

03:02:56.666 --> 03:02:58.901 region:rollup2
WE'RE SANDRA MAINLY PINE TREES.

03:02:58.034 --> 03:02:59.936 region:rollup2
THE ONES THAT ARE MOST

03:02:58.901 --> 03:03:01.571 region:rollup2
COMBUSTIBLE [inaudible]

03:02:59.936 --> 03:03:03.072 region:rollup2
GENERALLY.

03:03:01.571 --> 03:03:04.841 region:rollup2
WELL I UNLESS A RELISH VERY

03:03:03.072 --> 03:03:06.342 region:rollup2
COMBUSTIBLE WAS AND BUT THAT'S

03:03:04.841 --> 03:03:07.443 region:rollup2
NOT INCLUDED I'M JUST TALKING

03:03:06.342 --> 03:03:08.878 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE HUNDRED TWENTY NINE

03:03:07.443 --> 03:03:10.079 region:rollup2
MILLION TREES.

03:03:08.878 --> 03:03:12.748 region:rollup2
WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT THE

03:03:10.079 --> 03:03:14.750 region:rollup2
BRUSH OR THE THE THE THE THE

03:03:12.748 --> 03:03:16.085 region:rollup2
GROUND FLOOR OF THE FOREST WHICH

03:03:14.750 --> 03:03:17.987 region:rollup2
IF WE JUST FOCUSED ON THE GROUND

03:03:16.085 --> 03:03:20.256 region:rollup2
FLOOR THAT WOULD BE [inaudible]

03:03:17.987 --> 03:03:21.958 region:rollup2
EXORBITANTLY EXPENSIVE.

03:03:20.256 --> 03:03:23.059 region:rollup2
THAT NEVER MIND THE TREES THAT

03:03:21.958 --> 03:03:24.227 region:rollup2
ARE ARE STANDING AND THEN NEVER

03:03:23.059 --> 03:03:25.995 region:rollup2
MIND.

03:03:24.227 --> 03:03:29.031 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THE POLLS THE

03:03:25.995 --> 03:03:32.401 region:rollup2
ENGINEERING WISE ARE NOT.

03:03:29.031 --> 03:03:35.471 region:rollup2
BUT WHAT THEY NEED TO BE. TO

03:03:32.401 --> 03:03:37.406 region:rollup2
WITHSTAND WINDS AND FIRES AND

03:03:35.471 --> 03:03:38.908 region:rollup2
EXTREME RAIN EVENTS.

03:03:37.406 --> 03:03:40.843 region:rollup2
SO WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT TRYING

03:03:38.908 --> 03:03:41.344 region:rollup2
TO PUT A PRICE TAG ON THE WHOLE

03:03:40.843 --> 03:03:42.879 region:rollup2
I MEAN WE CAN TALK ABOUT

03:03:41.344 --> 03:03:45.715 region:rollup2
PROCESS.

03:03:42.879 --> 03:03:47.049 region:rollup2
I WAS ON THE SENDING A CITY

03:03:45.715 --> 03:03:48.818 region:rollup2
COUNCIL AND UP THE COAST

03:03:47.049 --> 03:03:49.919 region:rollup2
COMMISSION AT THE SAME TIME.

03:03:48.818 --> 03:03:51.120 region:rollup2
THE CITY WAS TRYING TO CREATE

03:03:49.919 --> 03:03:52.955 region:rollup2
NEW REGULATIONS FOR BRUSH

03:03:51.120 --> 03:03:53.956 region:rollup2
MANAGEMENT WE WE HAD TO GO

03:03:52.955 --> 03:03:55.758 region:rollup2
THROUGH THE COASTAL COMMISSION

03:03:53.956 --> 03:03:56.492 region:rollup2
TO GET THESE APPROVED.

03:03:55.758 --> 03:03:58.594 region:rollup2
AND THE COULD NOT CLOSE THE

03:03:56.492 --> 03:04:00.263 region:rollup2
COMMISSION COMMISSION DENIED OUR

03:03:58.594 --> 03:04:02.765 region:rollup2
APPLICATION SO IT TOOK.

03:04:00.263 --> 03:04:04.200 region:rollup2
YEARS FOR US TO ACTUALLY GET.

03:04:02.765 --> 03:04:06.435 region:rollup2
A BRUSH MANAGEMENT PLAN FOR THE

03:04:04.200 --> 03:04:08.137 region:rollup2
CITY.

03:04:06.435 --> 03:04:09.505 region:rollup2
AND AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT

03:04:08.137 --> 03:04:10.706 region:rollup2
WE FOUND CENTER WHICH AT FIRST

03:04:09.505 --> 03:04:12.174 region:rollup2
PEOPLE LAUGHED AT IT'S A

03:04:10.706 --> 03:04:14.410 region:rollup2
LAUGHABLE THING YOU CAN SAY

03:04:12.174 --> 03:04:15.411 region:rollup2
WE'RE GONNA USE GOATS. TO MANAGE

03:04:14.410 --> 03:04:17.113 region:rollup2
OUR BRUSHES SENEGAL AND SAN

03:04:15.411 --> 03:04:18.614 region:rollup2
DIEGO IN A CITY LIKE MANY PEOPLE

03:04:17.113 --> 03:04:20.349 region:rollup2
RESPONDED. TO THAT PLANET

03:04:18.614 --> 03:04:21.918 region:rollup2
LAUGHTER BUT ACTUALLY BEEN IT

03:04:20.349 --> 03:04:24.086 region:rollup2
WAS ACTUALLY ONE OF THE MOST

03:04:21.918 --> 03:04:25.655 region:rollup2
COST EFFECTIVE.

03:04:24.086 --> 03:04:27.523 region:rollup2
AND MOST EFFECTIVE TOOLS AT

03:04:25.655 --> 03:04:28.291 region:rollup2
TREATING BRUSH.

03:04:27.523 --> 03:04:30.526 region:rollup2
IN RESIDENTIAL AND OPEN SPACE

03:04:28.291 --> 03:04:32.929 region:rollup2
VERY.

03:04:30.526 --> 03:04:33.763 region:rollup2
AND THEN IT ENDED UP BEING BUT

03:04:32.929 --> 03:04:34.997 region:rollup2
THE COAST COMMISSION DIDN'T LIKE

03:04:33.763 --> 03:04:36.866 region:rollup2
PUTTING.

03:04:34.997 --> 03:04:38.568 region:rollup2
GOATS INSENSITIVE HABITAT.

03:04:36.866 --> 03:04:40.569 region:rollup2
SO I MEAN THERE THERE ARE NO

03:04:38.568 --> 03:04:40.803 region:rollup2
REAL CONSIDERATIONS.

03:04:40.569 --> 03:04:42.305 region:rollup2
THAT --

03:04:40.803 --> 03:04:44.407 region:rollup2
OREGON --

03:04:42.305 --> 03:04:45.741 region:rollup2
BRING CONFLICT TO THIS DEBATE IN

03:04:44.407 --> 03:04:47.243 region:rollup2
THE STATE CAN JUST COME AND SAY

03:04:45.741 --> 03:04:48.878 region:rollup2
WE'RE GONNA AVOID.

03:04:47.243 --> 03:04:50.513 region:rollup2
FORGET ABOUT SENSE OF HABITAT WE

03:04:48.878 --> 03:04:53.349 region:rollup2
WERE GONNA IGNORE IT NOW BECAUSE

03:04:50.513 --> 03:04:54.917 region:rollup2
OF FIRES SO DO ANYTHING ANYONE

03:04:53.349 --> 03:04:56.185 region:rollup2
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE JUST I

03:04:54.917 --> 03:04:58.254 region:rollup2
MEAN WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT.

03:04:56.185 --> 03:05:00.723 region:rollup2
REGULATIONS A PROCESS YOU CAN'T

03:04:58.254 --> 03:05:01.257 region:rollup2
JUST COME IN AND STEP ON CERTAIN

03:05:00.723 --> 03:05:01.724 region:rollup2
THINGS THAT ARE ALSO VERY

03:05:01.257 --> 03:05:03.693 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT [inaudible]

03:05:01.724 --> 03:05:06.162 region:rollup2
SO.

03:05:03.693 --> 03:05:07.396 region:rollup2
HAVING THE LOCALS ENGAGE IN A

03:05:06.162 --> 03:05:09.165 region:rollup2
LOCAL PROGRAM IS VERY EXPECT A

03:05:07.396 --> 03:05:10.933 region:rollup2
VERY IMPORTANT.

03:05:09.165 --> 03:05:12.034 region:rollup2
HAVE BEEN THE MANAGER LOCAL

03:05:10.933 --> 03:05:13.469 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS VERY IMPORTANT AND THEN

03:05:12.034 --> 03:05:15.137 region:rollup2
THE STATE CAN COME IN AND

03:05:13.469 --> 03:05:16.172 region:rollup2
SUPPLANT AND THAT'S WHERE I I

03:05:15.137 --> 03:05:17.606 region:rollup2
THINK THIS THIS HEARING WILL BE

03:05:16.172 --> 03:05:19.342 region:rollup2
VERY HELPFUL GETTING PEOPLE TO

03:05:17.606 --> 03:05:21.143 region:rollup2
ENGAGE IN SAY YES.

03:05:19.342 --> 03:05:22.244 region:rollup2
THIS IS WHAT WE CAN PROVIDE THIS

03:05:21.143 --> 03:05:24.246 region:rollup2
IS WHAT WOULD THE STATE I DON'T

03:05:22.244 --> 03:05:25.181 region:rollup2
THINK AND THINK WE'LL FIX EVERY

03:05:24.246 --> 03:05:25.481 region:rollup2
PROBLEM IS IT'LL JUST BE

03:05:25.181 --> 03:05:27.083 region:rollup2
[inaudible]

03:05:25.481 --> 03:05:29.285 region:rollup2
JUST.

03:05:27.083 --> 03:05:32.288 region:rollup2
COST PROHIBITIVE TO COME TO THE

03:05:29.285 --> 03:05:34.523 region:rollup2
CP A SECOND FIX EVERY PROBLEM --

03:05:32.288 --> 03:05:36.158 region:rollup2
CAL FIRE FIX EVERY PROBLEM.

03:05:34.523 --> 03:05:37.293 region:rollup2
UTILITIES YOU NEED A FIX EVERY

03:05:36.158 --> 03:05:39.428 region:rollup2
PROBLEM.

03:05:37.293 --> 03:05:41.364 region:rollup2
BUT WE CAN ALL.

03:05:39.428 --> 03:05:43.032 region:rollup2
ALL AS A COMMITTEE AND THERE AS

03:05:41.364 --> 03:05:45.701 region:rollup2
A COMMUNITY PROPOSE.

03:05:43.032 --> 03:05:47.336 region:rollup2
THE MOST IMMEDIATE SOLUTIONS TO

03:05:45.701 --> 03:05:50.106 region:rollup2
THE MOST PRESSING PROBLEMS THAT

03:05:47.336 --> 03:05:52.641 region:rollup2
COULD HELP US AT LEAST.

03:05:50.106 --> 03:05:54.176 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW A ADDRESS.

03:05:52.641 --> 03:05:56.012 region:rollup2
A MAKE THESE WILDFIRES LESS

03:05:54.176 --> 03:05:58.948 region:rollup2
DESTRUCTIVE.

03:05:56.012 --> 03:05:59.982 region:rollup2
MAKE THE STATE MORE PREPARED TO

03:05:58.948 --> 03:06:02.952 region:rollup2
RESPONSE IN CASE OF A VERY.

03:05:59.982 --> 03:06:04.153 region:rollup2
CATASTROPHIC EVENT.

03:06:02.952 --> 03:06:05.287 region:rollup2
WHAT DO WE NEED HAVE A PLACE AND

03:06:04.153 --> 03:06:06.656 region:rollup2
WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON A FEW

03:06:05.287 --> 03:06:08.557 region:rollup2
BILLS THIS YEAR?

03:06:06.656 --> 03:06:09.859 region:rollup2
THAT I THINK WILL BE HELPFUL.

03:06:08.557 --> 03:06:11.127 region:rollup2
BUT I THINK AT SOME POINT THIS

03:06:09.859 --> 03:06:12.928 region:rollup2
COMMITTEES GONNA HAVE TO GET

03:06:11.127 --> 03:06:13.462 region:rollup2
TOGETHER PRIORITIZE AND SAY

03:06:12.928 --> 03:06:14.830 region:rollup2
THESE ARE GOING TO BE THE

03:06:13.462 --> 03:06:16.432 region:rollup2
ISSUES.

03:06:14.830 --> 03:06:17.466 region:rollup2
THEIR MOST IMPORTANT ON THIS AND

03:06:16.432 --> 03:06:21.070 region:rollup2
WE'RE GOING TO FOCUS ON THAT ME

03:06:17.466 --> 03:06:23.906 region:rollup2
WE HAVE. FOR WEEKS TO WORK ON ON

03:06:21.070 --> 03:06:25.241 region:rollup2
ON A MAJOR LEGISLATIVE PACKAGE

03:06:23.906 --> 03:06:27.643 region:rollup2
AND FROM THAT OUT I WAS HOPING

03:06:25.241 --> 03:06:29.078 region:rollup2
THAT WE COULD START TO FOCUS.

03:06:27.643 --> 03:06:30.413 region:rollup2
NOW ON WHAT THE SOLUTIONS ARE

03:06:29.078 --> 03:06:32.281 region:rollup2
GOING TO BE.

03:06:30.413 --> 03:06:33.416 region:rollup2
AND AND MAYBE EVEN THE CREATE

03:06:32.281 --> 03:06:35.518 region:rollup2
WORKING GROUPS IN DIFFERENT

03:06:33.416 --> 03:06:37.219 region:rollup2
AREAS THAT MAY.

03:06:35.518 --> 03:06:39.455 region:rollup2
SPILL INTO LAND USE --

03:06:37.219 --> 03:06:43.759 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION --

03:06:39.455 --> 03:06:45.094 region:rollup2
AND AND INSURANCE ME WE STATE WE

03:06:43.759 --> 03:06:47.797 region:rollup2
SET A CODE ON SHARON'S.

03:06:45.094 --> 03:06:49.065 region:rollup2
AND THAT ME JUST BECAUSE ARISE.

03:06:47.797 --> 03:06:50.266 region:rollup2
IN WHAT INSURANCE COMPANIES ARE

03:06:49.065 --> 03:06:53.636 region:rollup2
WHAT WHAT ONCE YOU SET

03:06:50.266 --> 03:06:54.336 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENT. TO TO USE A CERTAIN

03:06:53.636 --> 03:06:55.671 region:rollup2
METHOD.

03:06:54.336 --> 03:06:57.506 region:rollup2
OR A CERTAIN PRODUCT.

03:06:55.671 --> 03:06:59.241 region:rollup2
THAT IS GOING TO CREATE.

03:06:57.506 --> 03:07:00.676 region:rollup2
OUT OF OUTNUMBER DON'T BE A

03:06:59.241 --> 03:07:02.812 region:rollup2
MARKET ADJUSTMENT AND THAT MAY

03:07:00.676 --> 03:07:04.480 region:rollup2
JUST BE HOW BY CREATING A RULE

03:07:02.812 --> 03:07:06.015 region:rollup2
WE CREATE.

03:07:04.480 --> 03:07:07.516 region:rollup2
AND INCREASED THE RATE PAYERS

03:07:06.015 --> 03:07:08.718 region:rollup2
THAT WE DON'T NECESSARILY WANT.

03:07:07.516 --> 03:07:09.885 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO FIND

03:07:08.718 --> 03:07:12.121 region:rollup2
A WAY TO DO THIS MOST

03:07:09.885 --> 03:07:12.655 region:rollup2
EFFICIENTLY AND MAKE SURE THAT

03:07:12.121 --> 03:07:12.955 region:rollup2
WE THAT RATEPAYERS ARE NOT

03:07:12.655 --> 03:07:15.291 region:rollup2
[inaudible]

03:07:12.955 --> 03:07:17.793 region:rollup2
HARM -- TO

03:07:15.291 --> 03:07:19.729 region:rollup2
OR OR THAT WE LOOK AFTER REPAIRS

03:07:17.793 --> 03:07:21.997 region:rollup2
IN EVERY DECISION WE MAKE

03:07:19.729 --> 03:07:23.299 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I MIGHT HAVE MAY HAVE.

03:07:21.997 --> 03:07:24.800 region:rollup2
I AN IMPACT ON RATE FAIRS I JUST

03:07:23.299 --> 03:07:27.002 region:rollup2
COULD.

03:07:24.800 --> 03:07:28.904 region:rollup2
IN TURN ALSO DEVASTATE OUR OUR

03:07:27.002 --> 03:07:30.840 region:rollup2
ECONOMY AND DEVASTATE --

03:07:28.904 --> 03:07:32.408 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THE POOR.

03:07:30.840 --> 03:07:33.242 region:rollup2
HIS MILITARY TO THE POOR

03:07:32.408 --> 03:07:34.910 region:rollup2
PEOPLE'S ABILITIES SAYING

03:07:33.242 --> 03:07:35.878 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA.

03:07:34.910 --> 03:07:37.713 region:rollup2
AND AND HOW.

03:07:35.878 --> 03:07:39.849 region:rollup2
AND HOUSING.

03:07:37.713 --> 03:07:41.584 region:rollup2
WE KNOW WHERE WE CITED THE THE

03:07:39.849 --> 03:07:42.651 region:rollup2
REASON WHY WE'RE HAVING SPRAWLS

03:07:41.584 --> 03:07:43.953 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE'RE NOT THAT IT'S A

03:07:42.651 --> 03:07:47.323 region:rollup2
FINE OUR URBAN CENTERS WIFE

03:07:43.953 --> 03:07:49.492 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT'S IT'S JUST

03:07:47.323 --> 03:07:51.594 region:rollup2
POLITICALLY --

03:07:49.492 --> 03:07:54.330 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW I IT'S NOT POLITICALLY

03:07:51.594 --> 03:07:55.397 region:rollup2
SMART. TO TO GO AGAINST WHAT

03:07:54.330 --> 03:07:57.333 region:rollup2
PEOPLE IN OUR COMMUNITIES ONE

03:07:55.397 --> 03:07:58.400 region:rollup2
ARKHAM PEOPLE CALIFORNIA DO NOT

03:07:57.333 --> 03:07:59.502 region:rollup2
WANT DENSITY IN THEIR

03:07:58.400 --> 03:08:01.036 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES AND THAT'S WHY

03:07:59.502 --> 03:08:03.405 region:rollup2
ZONING.

03:08:01.036 --> 03:08:05.241 region:rollup2
HAS NOT CHANGED IF NOT WE HAVE

03:08:03.405 --> 03:08:06.876 region:rollup2
DOWN SO WE'VE GONE FROM.

03:08:05.241 --> 03:08:08.410 region:rollup2
ALLOWING A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF

03:08:06.876 --> 03:08:10.079 region:rollup2
UNITS OF ZONING DOWN TILL A

03:08:08.410 --> 03:08:12.248 region:rollup2
LESSON THAT'S IN THE LAST THIRTY

03:08:10.079 --> 03:08:12.815 region:rollup2
YEARS WHICH IS MADE.

03:08:12.248 --> 03:08:14.283 region:rollup2
SO I MEAN THAT EVERYTHING IS

03:08:12.815 --> 03:08:15.551 region:rollup2
RELATED.

03:08:14.283 --> 03:08:17.253 region:rollup2
WHERE EVERYTHING IS RELATED WE

03:08:15.551 --> 03:08:18.053 region:rollup2
CAN'T IGNORE THOSE AREAS BUT I

03:08:17.253 --> 03:08:19.522 region:rollup2
THINK AS THIS COMMITTEE WE NEED

03:08:18.053 --> 03:08:21.257 region:rollup2
TO FOCUS?

03:08:19.522 --> 03:08:22.658 region:rollup2
WHAT THAT'S GOING TO BE AND?

TO SEE THIS SIGNIFICANT LOSS OF

03:09:25.788 --> 03:09:28.691 region:rollup2
LIFE AND PROPERTY THAT WE HAVE

03:09:26.989 --> 03:09:30.125 region:rollup2

NOW BECAUSE OF A WILDFIRE IN MY

03:09:37.633 --> 03:09:42.104 region:rollup2
DISTRICT SO --

03:09:39.835 --> 03:09:44.873 region:rollup2
MY SISTER LIVES IN OREGON THEIR

03:09:42.104 --> 03:09:45.708 region:rollup2
BAND AND WAS JUST TOLD HER HOUSE

03:09:44.873 --> 03:09:46.909 region:rollup2
SHE'S GOING TO HAVE TO

03:09:45.708 --> 03:09:49.778 region:rollup2
POTENTIALLY EVACUATE.

03:09:46.909 --> 03:09:51.480 region:rollup2
BECAUSE A FIRE SO --

03:09:49.778 --> 03:09:53.048 region:rollup2
I HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS IF I MAY

03:09:51.480 --> 03:09:56.051 region:rollup2
MISTER CHAIR --

03:09:53.048 --> 03:09:57.019 region:rollup2
FIRST DUH. TO MR PICKLER THANK

03:09:56.051 --> 03:09:58.153 region:rollup2
YOU FOR BEING HERE AND THANK YOU

03:09:57.019 --> 03:09:59.455 region:rollup2
FOR YOUR PRESENTATION AND I

03:09:58.153 --> 03:10:00.322 region:rollup2
DON'T KNOW HOW YOU DO WHAT YOU

03:09:59.455 --> 03:10:01.190 region:rollup2
DO WITH THE NUMBER PLACE THAT

03:10:00.322 --> 03:10:03.025 region:rollup2
YOU HAVE.

03:10:01.190 --> 03:10:04.460 region:rollup2
AND THE RESPONSIBILITIES THAT

03:10:03.025 --> 03:10:06.896 region:rollup2
YOU HAVE CERTAINLY YOUR SCHOOL.

03:10:04.460 --> 03:10:08.597 region:rollup2
OF RESPONSIBILITY HAS BECOME.

03:10:06.896 --> 03:10:10.799 region:rollup2
MORE COMPLICATED --

03:10:08.597 --> 03:10:12.401 region:rollup2
OVERTIME NOT LESS COMPLICATED

03:10:10.799 --> 03:10:15.271 region:rollup2
OVERTIME --

03:10:12.401 --> 03:10:18.340 region:rollup2
AND YOU SAID ON A A FEW DO ABOUT

03:10:15.271 --> 03:10:20.643 region:rollup2
THE COMPLEXITIES OF PEOPLE

03:10:18.340 --> 03:10:22.011 region:rollup2
COHABITATING INFRASTRUCTURE ON

03:10:20.643 --> 03:10:23.479 region:rollup2
POLLS YOU MENTION TELECOM AS AN

03:10:22.011 --> 03:10:25.614 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE.

03:10:23.479 --> 03:10:30.753 region:rollup2
SO WHEN TELECOM WANTS TO COLLECT

03:10:25.614 --> 03:10:32.821 region:rollup2
KATE ON A HOLE IS THAT THE

03:10:30.753 --> 03:10:35.391 region:rollup2
REVIEW THAT YOU DO OR IS THAT A

03:10:32.821 --> 03:10:36.892 region:rollup2
REVIEW THAT THE UTILITY DOES IT

03:10:35.391 --> 03:10:38.427 region:rollup2
SUBMITS IT TO YOU. TO ENSURE

03:10:36.892 --> 03:10:41.230 region:rollup2
THAT.

03:10:38.427 --> 03:10:42.731 region:rollup2
I ASSUME THERE'S SOME --

03:10:41.230 --> 03:10:44.600 region:rollup2
GUIDELINES THAT THEY HAVE TO

03:10:42.731 --> 03:10:45.968 region:rollup2
FALL TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE.

03:10:44.600 --> 03:10:48.003 region:rollup2
ATTACH SAFELY THAT THEY DON'T.

03:10:45.968 --> 03:10:48.637 region:rollup2
CAUSE A FIRE HAZARD COULD YOU

03:10:48.003 --> 03:10:49.705 region:rollup2
JUST ELABORATE ON THAT A LITTLE

03:10:48.637 --> 03:10:51.106 region:rollup2
BIT FOR ME.

03:10:49.705 --> 03:10:52.708 region:rollup2
IT'S A LITTLE BIT COMPLEX IN

03:10:51.106 --> 03:10:55.110 region:rollup2
THIS DIFFERENT AROUND THE STATE

03:10:52.708 --> 03:10:57.379 region:rollup2
SO IN SAN DIEGO WHOSE --

03:10:55.110 --> 03:10:59.515 region:rollup2
GAS ELECTRIC SERVICE AREA THEY

03:10:57.379 --> 03:11:01.350 region:rollup2
PRETTY MUCH MAINTAIN THE PROCESS

03:10:59.515 --> 03:11:03.552 region:rollup2
IN HOUSE --

03:11:01.350 --> 03:11:05.087 region:rollup2
IN OTHER AREAS BECAUSE OF

03:11:03.552 --> 03:11:07.122 region:rollup2
COMPLAINTS THAT THE ELECTRIC

03:11:05.087 --> 03:11:09.291 region:rollup2
UTILITIES WERE SLOW --

03:11:07.122 --> 03:11:09.658 region:rollup2
AND REMEMBER PARTICULARLY AFTER

03:11:09.291 --> 03:11:12.328 region:rollup2
DEREGULATION IN

03:11:09.658 --> 03:11:15.097 region:rollup2
TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND A HUNGER

03:11:12.328 --> 03:11:17.800 region:rollup2
TO SEE NEW TECHNOLOGIES BROUGHT

03:11:15.097 --> 03:11:19.668 region:rollup2
TO TO THEIR CUSTOMERS --

03:11:17.800 --> 03:11:21.437 region:rollup2
THE THEY'VE SHOPPED IT OUT SO

03:11:19.668 --> 03:11:23.105 region:rollup2
FOR EXAMPLE P. JEANNIE AND

03:11:21.437 --> 03:11:25.708 region:rollup2
NORTHERN CALIFORNIA.

03:11:23.105 --> 03:11:27.076 region:rollup2
ACTION ACTUALLY GAVE UP TO THE

03:11:25.708 --> 03:11:29.078 region:rollup2
WHAT THEY CALL THE

03:11:27.076 --> 03:11:31.046 region:rollup2
COMMUNICATIONS SPACE. TO A TNT

03:11:29.078 --> 03:11:33.782 region:rollup2
AND THEY MANAGE.

03:11:31.046 --> 03:11:36.018 region:rollup2
THERE'S ARE ALSO VEHICLES THERE

03:11:33.782 --> 03:11:38.087 region:rollup2
WE CALL THE POLISH AUTHORITIES

03:11:36.018 --> 03:11:40.022 region:rollup2
WHO HAVE FOR MANY MANY MANY

03:11:38.087 --> 03:11:42.124 region:rollup2
DECADES SORT OF MANAGE THAT

03:11:40.022 --> 03:11:43.859 region:rollup2
PROCESS THEY COLLECT RENTS THEY

03:11:42.124 --> 03:11:45.928 region:rollup2
FREQUENTLY TRACK.

03:11:43.859 --> 03:11:47.696 region:rollup2
WHO'S DOING WHAT BUT THEY DON'T

03:11:45.928 --> 03:11:48.430 region:rollup2
THEIR PRIVATE ASSOCIATIONS THAT

03:11:47.696 --> 03:11:51.533 region:rollup2
ARE ESSENTIALLY PROVIDING A

03:11:48.430 --> 03:11:55.104 region:rollup2
SERVICE. TWO THE POLL.

03:11:51.533 --> 03:11:57.406 region:rollup2
ABOUT 9295% OF ALL THE POLLS

03:11:55.104 --> 03:11:58.540 region:rollup2
ROOM BY THE ELECTRIC UTILITIES.

03:11:57.406 --> 03:12:00.342 region:rollup2
BUT AGAIN.

03:11:58.540 --> 03:12:03.312 region:rollup2
THE LEGISLATURE ITSELF HAS BEEN

03:12:00.342 --> 03:12:04.646 region:rollup2
VERY CLEAR ABOUT USING THIS

03:12:03.312 --> 03:12:07.182 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE TO GET

03:12:04.646 --> 03:12:08.384 region:rollup2
TELECOMMUNICATIONS TO POPULATION

03:12:07.182 --> 03:12:10.552 region:rollup2
TO RUN THE SERVE.

03:12:08.384 --> 03:12:11.787 region:rollup2
SO WE PROVIDE A GRANT OF SERVICE

03:12:10.552 --> 03:12:13.355 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF THE CALIFORNIA

03:12:11.787 --> 03:12:14.089 region:rollup2
ADVANCED SERVICES FUND.

03:12:13.355 --> 03:12:18.560 region:rollup2
THAT'S DESIGNED TO HELP GET

03:12:14.089 --> 03:12:20.329 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY DON'T HAVE HIGH SPEED

03:12:18.560 --> 03:12:22.131 region:rollup2
OR BROADBAND TO THE HOUSE.

03:12:20.329 --> 03:12:23.799 region:rollup2
AND THAT INFRASTRUCTURE HAS TO

03:12:22.131 --> 03:12:26.502 region:rollup2
GO ON POLLS SO THERE'S

03:12:23.799 --> 03:12:28.837 region:rollup2
COUNTERVAILING PRESSURES HERE.

03:12:26.502 --> 03:12:30.039 region:rollup2
AND DUH AND WHO DEVELOPS A

03:12:28.837 --> 03:12:31.740 region:rollup2
STANDARDS FOR THEM TO DEVELOP A

03:12:30.039 --> 03:12:36.912 region:rollup2
STANDARDS.

03:12:31.740 --> 03:12:39.448 region:rollup2
SO OF THE THE STANDARD O. FOR

03:12:36.912 --> 03:12:41.450 region:rollup2
WELL POOL OF LOOTING AND FOR THE

03:12:39.448 --> 03:12:43.685 region:rollup2
AT THE C. FOR ATTACHMENTS IS THE

03:12:41.450 --> 03:12:44.753 region:rollup2
SAME FOR ELECTRIC AND

03:12:43.685 --> 03:12:47.589 region:rollup2
TELECOMMUNICATIONS.

03:12:44.753 --> 03:12:49.391 region:rollup2
AND IT'S WITHIN THE SCENE ó

03:12:47.589 --> 03:12:50.225 region:rollup2
SET OF REGULATIONS THAT THE

03:12:49.391 --> 03:12:51.293 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES

03:12:50.225 --> 03:12:52.995 region:rollup2
ADOPTED [inaudible]

03:12:51.293 --> 03:12:55.964 region:rollup2
OKAY.

03:12:52.995 --> 03:12:57.499 region:rollup2

ABOUT THE NATIONAL ELECTRIC

03:12:59.268 --> 03:13:03.005 region:rollup2
SAFETY CODE.

03:13:00.803 --> 03:13:04.540 region:rollup2
AND IT SOUNDS LIKE A YEAR

03:13:03.005 --> 03:13:05.174 region:rollup2
INTIMATING THAT WE HAVE OUR OWN

03:13:04.540 --> 03:13:06.775 region:rollup2
CODE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

03:13:05.174 --> 03:13:08.844 region:rollup2
--

03:13:06.775 --> 03:13:10.746 region:rollup2
COULD YOU COMPARE CONTRAST THE

03:13:08.844 --> 03:13:12.114 region:rollup2
TWO JUST CALIFORNIA TAKE IT.

03:13:10.746 --> 03:13:14.416 region:rollup2
A A STEP IN A MUCH BETTER

03:13:12.114 --> 03:13:15.984 region:rollup2
DIRECTION AND YOU SEE AREAS

03:13:14.416 --> 03:13:16.585 region:rollup2
WHERE OUR CALIFORNIA.

03:13:15.984 --> 03:13:18.620 region:rollup2
ELECTRIC SAFETY CODE NEEDS TO

03:13:16.585 --> 03:13:20.722 region:rollup2
BE.

03:13:18.620 --> 03:13:22.825 region:rollup2
RADICALLY IMPROVE.

03:13:20.722 --> 03:13:25.661 region:rollup2
ALONG WITH Z. THOUGH

03:13:22.825 --> 03:13:27.863 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA'S OVERHEAD FACILITIES

03:13:25.661 --> 03:13:29.531 region:rollup2
SO OF SAFETY REGULATIONS SCHOOL

03:13:27.863 --> 03:13:31.400 region:rollup2
GENERAL WOULD IN NINETY FIVE

03:13:29.531 --> 03:13:32.901 region:rollup2
IT'S THESE THE CPUC STANDARD

03:13:31.400 --> 03:13:34.269 region:rollup2
WHICH PREDATES THE NATIONAL

03:13:32.901 --> 03:13:35.838 region:rollup2
ELECTRIC SAFETY CODE.

03:13:34.269 --> 03:13:39.708 region:rollup2
I BELIEVE SO.

03:13:35.838 --> 03:13:42.044 region:rollup2
AND A IT IS SPECIFICALLY MORE

03:13:39.708 --> 03:13:44.113 region:rollup2
STRINGENT SOME OR ALL THE AREAS

03:13:42.044 --> 03:13:44.947 region:rollup2
SO THE RELIEF IT'S WILD FIRE

03:13:44.113 --> 03:13:47.850 region:rollup2
SAFETY.

03:13:44.947 --> 03:13:48.817 region:rollup2
HOMELESS VEGETATION CLEARANCE

03:13:47.850 --> 03:13:49.651 region:rollup2
REQUIRE --

03:13:48.817 --> 03:13:54.523 region:rollup2
AND POLLUTING CALCULATIONS OF

03:13:49.651 --> 03:13:56.758 region:rollup2
THE AREAS SPECIFICALLY WHERE THE

03:13:54.523 --> 03:13:58.393 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA STANDARDS EXCEED THE

03:13:56.758 --> 03:14:01.096 region:rollup2
NATIONAL ELECTRIC SAFETY CODE.

03:13:58.393 --> 03:14:03.365 region:rollup2
WELL WE HAVE SEVERAL EL STUDIES

03:14:01.096 --> 03:14:04.933 region:rollup2
THAT COMPARE OF THE NATIONAL

03:14:03.365 --> 03:14:06.935 region:rollup2
ELECTRIC SAFETY CODE TO GENERAL

03:14:04.933 --> 03:14:10.038 region:rollup2
ORDER. NINETY FIVE OH WHEN WE

03:14:06.935 --> 03:14:13.675 region:rollup2
IDENTIFY SOME POTENTIAL AREAS SO

03:14:10.038 --> 03:14:15.544 region:rollup2
WE ARE AT THE DID GENERAL ORDER

03:14:13.675 --> 03:14:16.979 region:rollup2
NINETY FIVE CAN BE IMPROVED.

03:14:15.544 --> 03:14:18.714 region:rollup2
WELL WE AND THOSE

03:14:16.979 --> 03:14:19.281 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATIONS ARE PROPOSED

03:14:18.714 --> 03:14:21.016 region:rollup2
THERE IS --

03:14:19.281 --> 03:14:23.852 region:rollup2
THERE'S BEEN AN ONGOING WORKING

03:14:21.016 --> 03:14:25.053 region:rollup2
GROUP EL FOR GENERAL ORDER

03:14:23.852 --> 03:14:26.889 region:rollup2
NINETY FIVE AND WE'VE HAD --

03:14:25.053 --> 03:14:29.458 region:rollup2
ALSO RULED PROCEEDINGS AT THE

03:14:26.889 --> 03:14:30.859 region:rollup2
COMMISSION WE CONTINUOUSLY AMEND

03:14:29.458 --> 03:14:32.794 region:rollup2
AND UPDATES --

03:14:30.859 --> 03:14:35.030 region:rollup2
THAT CALIFORNIA REGULATIONS IN

03:14:32.794 --> 03:14:36.565 region:rollup2
ORDER TO SOLVE MAJOR AMENDMENTS

03:14:35.030 --> 03:14:38.367 region:rollup2
TO IT JUST RECENTLY.

03:14:36.565 --> 03:14:39.902 region:rollup2
WELL ONE OF THEM WAS THE FIRE

03:14:38.367 --> 03:14:41.904 region:rollup2
THROAT MOPS THE WERE TALKING

03:14:39.902 --> 03:14:45.841 region:rollup2
ABOUT EARLIER HELD THE MAPS

03:14:41.904 --> 03:14:46.875 region:rollup2
THEMSELVES HAD ANOTHER --

03:14:45.841 --> 03:14:47.943 region:rollup2
COMMISSION DECISION.

03:14:46.875 --> 03:14:52.014 region:rollup2
AND THAT WAS ADOPTED SO WHAT

03:14:47.943 --> 03:14:54.416 region:rollup2
MORAL LESS CONCURRENTLY OR HOW

03:14:52.014 --> 03:14:56.752 region:rollup2
THE ELECTRIC CH T..

03:14:54.416 --> 03:14:58.720 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENTS --

03:14:56.752 --> 03:15:01.990 region:rollup2
OR DIFFERENCE DEPENDING ON THE

03:14:58.720 --> 03:15:04.660 region:rollup2
FIRE RISKS SO THAT WAS A BIG

03:15:01.990 --> 03:15:06.428 region:rollup2
AMENDMENTS A TO GENERAL ORDER IN

03:15:04.660 --> 03:15:08.363 region:rollup2
NINETY FIVE A TO HELP MAKE IT

03:15:06.428 --> 03:15:10.032 region:rollup2
MORE STRINGENT IN THE AREAS OF

03:15:08.363 --> 03:15:11.266 region:rollup2
HIGH FIRE THREATS LOANS.

03:15:10.032 --> 03:15:13.702 region:rollup2
AND THEN THERE'S THE THERE WAS

03:15:11.266 --> 03:15:14.937 region:rollup2
ANOTHER DECISION RECENTLY THAT

03:15:13.702 --> 03:15:17.306 region:rollup2
GO.

03:15:14.937 --> 03:15:19.942 region:rollup2
NEED THOUGH CHANGES TO GO

03:15:17.306 --> 03:15:22.044 region:rollup2
PORTION OF THAT RULE THAT DEALS

03:15:19.942 --> 03:15:23.979 region:rollup2
WITH SO.

03:15:22.044 --> 03:15:25.781 region:rollup2
HOW FAST THE UTILITIES HAVE TO

03:15:23.979 --> 03:15:28.317 region:rollup2
CORRECT --

03:15:25.781 --> 03:15:30.352 region:rollup2
POTENTIAL ISSUES DEPENDING ON

03:15:28.317 --> 03:15:32.821 region:rollup2
THEIR OF A SEVERITY OF

03:15:30.352 --> 03:15:35.624 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANTLY TIGHTENING UP THE

03:15:32.821 --> 03:15:36.992 region:rollup2
TIME LINES AND STRENGTHENING

03:15:35.624 --> 03:15:38.927 region:rollup2
HELL THOSE REQUIREMENTS. TO MAKE

03:15:36.992 --> 03:15:40.829 region:rollup2
SURE THAT BOTH ELECTRIC AND SO

03:15:38.927 --> 03:15:42.664 region:rollup2
THE COMMUNICATION COMPANIES ARE

03:15:40.829 --> 03:15:43.832 region:rollup2
INSPECTING THEIR FACILITIES AND

03:15:42.664 --> 03:15:44.933 region:rollup2
AS THEY IDENTIFY ISSUES THAT

03:15:43.832 --> 03:15:47.369 region:rollup2
THEY HAVE BEEN AGGRESSIVE RISK

03:15:44.933 --> 03:15:48.403 region:rollup2

03:15:47.369 --> 03:15:51.340 region:rollup2
THE TITLE NAM.

03:15:48.403 --> 03:15:52.240 region:rollup2
AND WE CONTINUED TO EVALUATES

03:15:51.340 --> 03:15:53.909 region:rollup2
ó.

03:15:52.240 --> 03:15:55.444 region:rollup2
ALL WERE THOUGH REGULATIONS

ó HOME.

03:16:05.921 --> 03:16:08.991 region:rollup2
THAT KNOW THAT WE'RE OF FELT

03:16:07.623 --> 03:16:11.994 region:rollup2
LOOKING UP WHAT THEY HAVE BEEN

03:16:08.991 --> 03:16:13.362 region:rollup2
DOING AS WELL AS CAL FIRE AND

03:16:11.994 --> 03:16:15.864 region:rollup2
THE UTILITIES A SMALL.

03:16:13.362 --> 03:16:17.299 region:rollup2
HOME THEY HAVE THE FACE SIMILAR

03:16:15.864 --> 03:16:18.767 region:rollup2
ISSUES AND SO.

03:16:17.299 --> 03:16:20.168 region:rollup2
WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THEM YOU

03:16:18.767 --> 03:16:21.637 region:rollup2
MENTIONED ALSO THAT A QUARTER OF

03:16:20.168 --> 03:16:23.905 region:rollup2
THE ADDITIONS ARE DUE --

03:16:21.637 --> 03:16:24.139 region:rollup2
TO VEGETATION COMING CONTACT

03:16:23.905 --> 03:16:26.642 region:rollup2

03:16:29.511 --> 03:16:33.081 region:rollup2
DO YOU BELIEVE THAT YOU HAVE A

03:16:30.712 --> 03:16:34.616 region:rollup2
STAFF WITH THE ENORMOUS

03:16:33.081 --> 03:16:36.885 region:rollup2
GEOGRAPHY THAT STATE CALIFORNIA

03:16:34.616 --> 03:16:38.120 region:rollup2
HAS TO PROACTIVELY ENSURE THE

03:16:36.885 --> 03:16:39.788 region:rollup2
VEGETATION IS.

03:16:38.120 --> 03:16:43.125 region:rollup2
IS KEPT UNDER CONTROL NUMBER ONE

03:16:39.788 --> 03:16:44.393 region:rollup2
TO NUMBER --

03:16:43.125 --> 03:16:46.728 region:rollup2
TWO ARE WE UTILIZING OUR

03:16:44.393 --> 03:16:49.131 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGY TO OUR BEST ADVANTAGE

03:16:46.728 --> 03:16:51.600 region:rollup2
AS AN EXAMPLE.

03:16:49.131 --> 03:16:54.836 region:rollup2
AND THE OTHER CORPORATE AREAS OF

03:16:51.600 --> 03:16:57.806 region:rollup2
TO MACULAR VARIETY CAME FROM --

03:16:54.836 --> 03:16:58.307 region:rollup2
CAL STATE SAN DIEGO OWNS A TWO

03:16:57.806 --> 03:17:01.109 region:rollup2
THOUSAND ACRE ECOLOGICAL

03:16:58.307 --> 03:17:03.578 region:rollup2
RESERVE.

03:17:01.109 --> 03:17:04.813 region:rollup2
THAT IS OBSERVE BY PEOPLE ALL

03:17:03.578 --> 03:17:07.482 region:rollup2
OVER THE PLANET BECAUSE THEY

03:17:04.813 --> 03:17:08.817 region:rollup2
HAVE THOUSANDS OF CAMERAS WE

03:17:07.482 --> 03:17:10.886 region:rollup2
KNOW THE COST OF THIS TECHNOLOGY

03:17:08.817 --> 03:17:12.421 region:rollup2
HAS COME DOWN --

03:17:10.886 --> 03:17:14.289 region:rollup2
WE ARE ABLE TO SEE THINGS THAT

03:17:12.421 --> 03:17:16.024 region:rollup2
WE NEVER THOUGHT WE'D BE ABLE TO

03:17:14.289 --> 03:17:16.792 region:rollup2
SEE AS INEXPENSIVELY AS WE COULD

03:17:16.024 --> 03:17:17.492 region:rollup2
HAS THERE BEEN A THOUGHT OF

03:17:16.792 --> 03:17:20.362 region:rollup2
PUTTING.

03:17:17.492 --> 03:17:22.664 region:rollup2
CAMERAS IN THESE VERY DANGEROUS

03:17:20.362 --> 03:17:23.932 region:rollup2
FIRE PRONE AREAS WHERE INSTEAD

03:17:22.664 --> 03:17:25.534 region:rollup2
OF HIRING PEOPLE WITH

03:17:23.932 --> 03:17:26.668 region:rollup2
HELICOPTERS FLYING.

03:17:25.534 --> 03:17:28.670 region:rollup2
OF PEOPLE TO GO ON THE GROUND

03:17:26.668 --> 03:17:29.805 region:rollup2
WITH JEEPS AND LOOKING AT THE

03:17:28.670 --> 03:17:31.306 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE OF MITIGATING THE

03:17:29.805 --> 03:17:32.774 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE.

03:17:31.306 --> 03:17:35.544 region:rollup2
THAT WE COULD USE.

03:17:32.774 --> 03:17:38.180 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGY AS A COST EFFECTIVE

03:17:35.544 --> 03:17:39.548 region:rollup2
ANY MUCH MORE EXPEDIENT WAY OF

03:17:38.180 --> 03:17:40.415 region:rollup2
RECOGNIZING WHEN WE SEE OVER

03:17:39.548 --> 03:17:45.354 region:rollup2
GROWTH THAT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO

03:17:40.415 --> 03:17:50.158 region:rollup2
CAUSE FIRES --

03:17:45.354 --> 03:17:52.227 region:rollup2
SO TO YOUR THE FIRST QUESTION AS

03:17:50.158 --> 03:17:56.198 region:rollup2
TO WHETHER WE HAVE --

03:17:52.227 --> 03:17:57.899 region:rollup2
THE SUFFICIENT STAFFING O..

03:17:56.198 --> 03:17:59.768 region:rollup2
WE AS I MENTIONED IT IN MY

03:17:57.899 --> 03:18:01.937 region:rollup2
TESTIMONY WE HAVE INCREASED OUR

03:17:59.768 --> 03:18:04.706 region:rollup2
STAFFING AND WILL CONTINUE TO

03:18:01.937 --> 03:18:07.142 region:rollup2
EVALUATE SO WAY NOW.

03:18:04.706 --> 03:18:09.644 region:rollup2
WE NEED TO DO FROM THE PC AS

03:18:07.142 --> 03:18:11.580 region:rollup2
WELL POINTS OF VIEW EL THE ORDER

03:18:09.644 --> 03:18:14.316 region:rollup2
OF MAGNITUDE OF AN ISSUE FACES

03:18:11.580 --> 03:18:16.952 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY EARTHQUAKE EXTENSIVE.

03:18:14.316 --> 03:18:19.521 region:rollup2
AND SO WE HAVE TO RELY ON

03:18:16.952 --> 03:18:21.356 region:rollup2
UTILITIES TO DO OF THE

03:18:19.521 --> 03:18:23.058 region:rollup2
PATROLLING TO ASSURE THE SAFETY

03:18:21.356 --> 03:18:24.760 region:rollup2
OF THEIR LINES WHICH IS THE

03:18:23.058 --> 03:18:27.095 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBILITY --

03:18:24.760 --> 03:18:29.598 region:rollup2
IN TERMS OF TECHNOLOGY THAT IS

03:18:27.095 --> 03:18:30.999 region:rollup2
AN AREA WHERE --

03:18:29.598 --> 03:18:34.069 region:rollup2
ANYTHING THERE'S A LOT OF

03:18:30.999 --> 03:18:35.470 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY --

03:18:34.069 --> 03:18:37.672 region:rollup2
FOR USING ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY

03:18:35.470 --> 03:18:40.175 region:rollup2
OTHER.

03:18:37.672 --> 03:18:41.810 region:rollup2
PROVE HOW WE TACKLE THIS ISSUE.

03:18:40.175 --> 03:18:43.378 region:rollup2
WELL THE CHALLENGES AS I

03:18:41.810 --> 03:18:45.847 region:rollup2
MENTIONED WITH VEGETATION A

03:18:43.378 --> 03:18:47.582 region:rollup2
REALLY OUTSIDE OF CLEARANCES

03:18:45.847 --> 03:18:49.117 region:rollup2
MEAN WE YEAH BUT YOU KNOW THAT

03:18:47.582 --> 03:18:51.486 region:rollup2
WE HAVE A TENTH VOIGTS --

03:18:49.117 --> 03:18:53.054 region:rollup2
CLEARANCE REQUIREMENT NOW --

03:18:51.486 --> 03:18:54.956 region:rollup2
FOR HIGH VOLTAGE DISTRIBUTION

03:18:53.054 --> 03:18:56.358 region:rollup2
LINES BUT YOU CAN KEEP

03:18:54.956 --> 03:18:58.426 region:rollup2
INCREASING OF THOSE LITTLE A

03:18:56.358 --> 03:19:00.328 region:rollup2
LIMIT OF DIMINISHING RETURNS

03:18:58.426 --> 03:19:02.030 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IF YOU HAVE ANY COULD

03:19:00.328 --> 03:19:04.966 region:rollup2
LOOKED THE STREET BUT IS.

03:19:02.030 --> 03:19:06.802 region:rollup2
A FULL TOLL THIRTY FORTY FOOT

03:19:04.966 --> 03:19:09.337 region:rollup2
AWAY FROM THE ELECTRIC CLIMB IT

03:19:06.802 --> 03:19:10.705 region:rollup2
STILL POSES DE PIECE THE FIRE

03:19:09.337 --> 03:19:13.608 region:rollup2
WELL THREATS.

03:19:10.705 --> 03:19:15.510 region:rollup2
SO UNLESS WE COMPLETELY CLEAR

03:19:13.608 --> 03:19:17.312 region:rollup2
WELL WILL VEGETATION AND THAT

03:19:15.510 --> 03:19:18.980 region:rollup2
THE SCHOOL ENOUGH TO POTENTIALLY

03:19:17.312 --> 03:19:20.682 region:rollup2
FULL OVER YOU KNOW YOU'RE NEVER

03:19:18.980 --> 03:19:22.083 region:rollup2
GOING TO COMPLETELY ELIMINATE

03:19:20.682 --> 03:19:23.518 region:rollup2
THE RISK IN THE ONE THAT POINTS

03:19:22.083 --> 03:19:26.254 region:rollup2
WHEN YOU HOW OF WINS.

03:19:23.518 --> 03:19:28.390 region:rollup2
ELM ALL EXCESS OF FIFTY SIXTY

03:19:26.254 --> 03:19:30.826 region:rollup2
AND UP TO NINETY MILES AN HOUR

03:19:28.390 --> 03:19:32.894 region:rollup2
THAT VEGETATION CAN BE EL

03:19:30.826 --> 03:19:34.629 region:rollup2
TROUBLING QUITE FAR SO WHAT WE

03:19:32.894 --> 03:19:36.598 region:rollup2
CAN BE DOING WITH ADVANCED

03:19:34.629 --> 03:19:38.433 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGIES IS DOING MUCH MORE

03:19:36.598 --> 03:19:39.901 region:rollup2
FREQUENT SURVEYING AND

03:19:38.433 --> 03:19:43.538 region:rollup2
COLLECTING NO.

03:19:39.901 --> 03:19:44.739 region:rollup2
DATA FOR ALMOST ALL LIGHT ARE

03:19:43.538 --> 03:19:45.841 region:rollup2
FROM.

03:19:44.739 --> 03:19:47.976 region:rollup2
HOME ADVENT OF THE TYPES OF THE

03:19:45.841 --> 03:19:50.745 region:rollup2
DANCE IMAGING AND THEN USING

03:19:47.976 --> 03:19:53.915 region:rollup2
ADVANCED ANALYTICS TO HELP HIM

03:19:50.745 --> 03:19:55.250 region:rollup2
POINTS SO AREAS WHERE YOU HAVE

03:19:53.915 --> 03:19:56.751 region:rollup2
THE HIGHEST RISKS IT'S REALLY

03:19:55.250 --> 03:20:00.322 region:rollup2
COMBINING.

03:19:56.751 --> 03:20:01.690 region:rollup2
ALL THE DATA THAT I EAT YOU CAN

03:20:00.322 --> 03:20:02.824 region:rollup2
GET FROM --

03:20:01.690 --> 03:20:05.060 region:rollup2
TOOK A FROM THE ADVANCED

03:20:02.824 --> 03:20:07.762 region:rollup2
SURVEYING WITH ANALYTICS BECAUSE

03:20:05.060 --> 03:20:10.332 region:rollup2
AS THEY EAT TOO IF YOU HEALTH US

03:20:07.762 --> 03:20:11.499 region:rollup2
SENSORS AND USE DIFFERENT DATA

03:20:10.332 --> 03:20:13.335 region:rollup2
SOURCES.

03:20:11.499 --> 03:20:15.837 region:rollup2
YOUR EVIL WITH TECHNOLOGY TO

03:20:13.335 --> 03:20:18.306 region:rollup2
IDENTIFY BUT CENTRAL VALLEY RISK

03:20:15.837 --> 03:20:19.774 region:rollup2
O. VEGETATION LOOKS AT RISK THAT

03:20:18.306 --> 03:20:22.177 region:rollup2
YOU JUST CANNOT DO WITH THE AT

03:20:19.774 --> 03:20:23.345 region:rollup2
AN ARBORIST WAS VISUALLY LOOKING

03:20:22.177 --> 03:20:28.383 region:rollup2
AT A TREE.

03:20:23.345 --> 03:20:29.017 region:rollup2

CHIEF WHAT IS THE BIGGEST

03:20:57.512 --> 03:21:01.816 region:rollup2
IMPEDIMENT AFTER READING OUR

03:20:59.381 --> 03:21:03.385 region:rollup2
FORCE OF A HUNDRED AND TWENTY

03:21:01.816 --> 03:21:06.288 region:rollup2
NINE MILLION DEAD TREES THAT ARE

03:21:03.385 --> 03:21:08.857 region:rollup2
KINDLING. FOR OUR FIRE SITUATION

03:21:06.288 --> 03:21:11.526 region:rollup2
HERE IN THE STATE --

03:21:08.857 --> 03:21:13.595 region:rollup2
CAPACITY IS IS --

03:21:11.526 --> 03:21:17.032 region:rollup2
THE BIGGEST ISSUE THERE --

03:21:13.595 --> 03:21:17.999 region:rollup2
SENATOR STONE BOTH CAPACITY IN

03:21:17.032 --> 03:21:19.834 region:rollup2
THE ABILITY --

03:21:17.999 --> 03:21:23.071 region:rollup2
TO HAVE.

03:21:19.834 --> 03:21:24.573 region:rollup2
CREWS AND EQUIPMENT AND JUST

03:21:23.071 --> 03:21:26.474 region:rollup2
SURE --

03:21:24.573 --> 03:21:28.643 region:rollup2
HUMAN POWER TO REMOVE THOSE

03:21:26.474 --> 03:21:31.646 region:rollup2
TREES -- BUT

03:21:28.643 --> 03:21:34.082 region:rollup2
ALSO IN THE THE OUTLETS FOR

03:21:31.646 --> 03:21:35.450 region:rollup2
THOSE FOR THE WOOD PRODUCTS THAT

03:21:34.082 --> 03:21:36.785 region:rollup2
COULD COME FROM THOSE THINGS

03:21:35.450 --> 03:21:39.287 region:rollup2
GOOD THOSE THOSE ARE THE BIGGEST

03:21:36.785 --> 03:21:41.489 region:rollup2
IMPEDIMENTS --

03:21:39.287 --> 03:21:43.158 region:rollup2
FOLLOWED CLOSELY BY A LOT OF

03:21:41.489 --> 03:21:43.658 region:rollup2
THESE TREES THE VAST MAJORITY

03:21:43.158 --> 03:21:45.660 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY ARE IN THE BACK

03:21:43.658 --> 03:21:46.928 region:rollup2
COUNTRY.

03:21:45.660 --> 03:21:50.031 region:rollup2
AWAY FROM --

03:21:46.928 --> 03:21:50.565 region:rollup2
ROADS AND AND INFRASTRUCTURE

03:21:50.031 --> 03:21:52.434 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD ALLOW FOR THEIR

03:21:50.565 --> 03:21:54.536 region:rollup2
REMOVAL --

03:21:52.434 --> 03:21:56.604 region:rollup2
WHICH HAS --

03:21:54.536 --> 03:21:58.373 region:rollup2
SOME BENEFIT IN THAT THEY'RE FAR

03:21:56.604 --> 03:22:00.308 region:rollup2
ENOUGH AWAY FROM FROM PEOPLE

03:21:58.373 --> 03:22:01.643 region:rollup2
THAT THEY'RE NOT A HUMAN HAZARD

03:22:00.308 --> 03:22:02.277 region:rollup2
AN ISSUE --

03:22:01.643 --> 03:22:05.280 region:rollup2
THERE STILL IS AN ENVIRONMENTAL

03:22:02.277 --> 03:22:06.715 region:rollup2
--

03:22:05.280 --> 03:22:09.584 region:rollup2
COST TO THAT.

03:22:06.715 --> 03:22:11.586 region:rollup2
ARE ALL OF THAT STANDING --

03:22:09.584 --> 03:22:14.889 region:rollup2
CARBON CELLULOSE IS GOING TO

03:22:11.586 --> 03:22:16.591 region:rollup2
FALL AND HAS STARTED TO FALL --

03:22:14.889 --> 03:22:19.527 region:rollup2
AND THAT WILL BE --

03:22:16.591 --> 03:22:20.996 region:rollup2
FUEL LOADING PROBLEM FOR US FOR

03:22:19.527 --> 03:22:22.163 region:rollup2
DECADES TO COME WHY UNDER I

03:22:20.996 --> 03:22:24.032 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND THE ENVIRONMENTAL

03:22:22.163 --> 03:22:25.467 region:rollup2
CONCERNS IT'S JUST NOT GOING IN

03:22:24.032 --> 03:22:27.002 region:rollup2
THERE WITH BULLDOZERS AND A AND

03:22:25.467 --> 03:22:28.403 region:rollup2
REMOVING TREES.

03:22:27.002 --> 03:22:30.005 region:rollup2
BUT I THINK WE NEED A MORE

03:22:28.403 --> 03:22:32.307 region:rollup2
PROACTIVE APPROACH IN THE STATE

03:22:30.005 --> 03:22:33.875 region:rollup2
AND MAYBE WE NEED TO PRIORITIZE

03:22:32.307 --> 03:22:35.143 region:rollup2
AREAS WHERE WE HAVE A LOT OF

03:22:33.875 --> 03:22:37.579 region:rollup2
DEAD TREES THAT ARE CLOSE.

03:22:35.143 --> 03:22:39.080 region:rollup2
TO POPULATION CENTERS SUPPOSEDLY

03:22:37.579 --> 03:22:43.018 region:rollup2
HE A RISK.

03:22:39.080 --> 03:22:44.052 region:rollup2
BECAUSE YOU DON'T IF WE LET THE

03:22:43.018 --> 03:22:45.754 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENTAL SIDE OF IT WAY TOO

03:22:44.052 --> 03:22:47.255 region:rollup2
MUCH.

03:22:45.754 --> 03:22:48.623 region:rollup2
WERE RISK OF HAVING A FIRE WHICH

03:22:47.255 --> 03:22:50.792 region:rollup2
IS GOING TO DECIMATE THE

03:22:48.623 --> 03:22:51.593 region:rollup2
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF ACRES

03:22:50.792 --> 03:22:53.461 region:rollup2
AND THERE WILL BE NO CRATERS

03:22:51.593 --> 03:22:54.929 region:rollup2
LEFT OKAY ISN'T GOING IN THERE

03:22:53.461 --> 03:22:56.331 region:rollup2
AND TRYING --

03:22:54.929 --> 03:22:58.433 region:rollup2
TO DO WEEKEND TO TO ELIMINATE

03:22:56.331 --> 03:22:59.868 region:rollup2
SOME OF THAT WOULD --

03:22:58.433 --> 03:23:01.036 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW AS WELL AS I DO RIGHT

03:22:59.868 --> 03:23:01.970 region:rollup2
NOW THERE'S A FIRE IN THE LIGHT

03:23:01.036 --> 03:23:03.838 region:rollup2
OF WHAT IS VENTURE THAT DID YOU

03:23:01.970 --> 03:23:04.239 region:rollup2
KNOW THAT ARE YOUR FIREFIGHTERS

03:23:03.838 --> 03:23:05.674 region:rollup2
IT --

03:23:04.239 --> 03:23:08.143 region:rollup2
HAVEN'T RYAN ARE PROBABLY

03:23:05.674 --> 03:23:10.812 region:rollup2
ACTIVELY FLYING THERE IN TRYING

03:23:08.143 --> 03:23:12.747 region:rollup2
TO GET THAT FIRE OUT --

03:23:10.812 --> 03:23:15.116 region:rollup2
IS IT STILL CALIFORNIA YEARS

03:23:12.747 --> 03:23:17.118 region:rollup2
POLICIES THAT THE FLY BY VISUAL

03:23:15.116 --> 03:23:19.220 region:rollup2
FLIGHT RULES AND WILL ONLY FLY

03:23:17.118 --> 03:23:20.822 region:rollup2
DURING DAYLIGHT HOURS OR DO WE

03:23:19.220 --> 03:23:22.757 region:rollup2
NOW HAVE ADVANCED AIRCRAFT.

03:23:20.822 --> 03:23:24.592 region:rollup2
THE COULD FIGHT FIRES --

03:23:22.757 --> 03:23:26.327 region:rollup2
THIRD OF THE TIME WHEN FIGHTERS

03:23:24.592 --> 03:23:27.896 region:rollup2
ARE GOING IN SPREADING AND AND

03:23:26.327 --> 03:23:28.530 region:rollup2
HISTORICALLY WE HAVE BEEN ABLE

03:23:27.896 --> 03:23:29.731 region:rollup2
TO PUT THE THING IN THE AIRPORT

03:23:28.530 --> 03:23:32.100 region:rollup2
AMOUNT.

03:23:29.731 --> 03:23:33.034 region:rollup2
IT'S SO RELATED TO FIXED WING

03:23:32.100 --> 03:23:34.502 region:rollup2
AIRCRAFT --

03:23:33.034 --> 03:23:36.671 region:rollup2
IT IS VISUAL --

03:23:34.502 --> 03:23:38.673 region:rollup2
THEY THEY CAN FLY TO A HALF HOUR

03:23:36.671 --> 03:23:39.307 region:rollup2
AFTER SUNSET --

03:23:38.673 --> 03:23:41.142 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S THAT'S THE END OF IT

03:23:39.307 --> 03:23:43.711 region:rollup2
--

03:23:41.142 --> 03:23:45.513 region:rollup2
SO FOR THAT'S THE FIXED WING AND

03:23:43.711 --> 03:23:46.748 region:rollup2
NOW FIXED WING THEY HAVE THEY

03:23:45.513 --> 03:23:50.652 region:rollup2
HAVE A DIFFERENT --

03:23:46.748 --> 03:23:52.954 region:rollup2
FLIGHT PATTERN VICTORY THAT AND

03:23:50.652 --> 03:23:55.223 region:rollup2
WOOD ROTARY WING --

03:23:52.954 --> 03:23:57.392 region:rollup2
WE DO HAVE ROTARY WING THAT WEEK

03:23:55.223 --> 03:23:58.026 region:rollup2
AND CALL UP BY --

03:23:57.392 --> 03:24:00.462 region:rollup2

AND SOME OF OUR PARTNER AGENCIES

03:24:03.298 --> 03:24:06.668 region:rollup2
HAVE SHIPS THAT CAN FLY TWENTY

03:24:05.633 --> 03:24:09.037 region:rollup2
FOUR HOURS A DAY.

03:24:06.668 --> 03:24:11.673 region:rollup2
SO THEY CAN DO WATER DROPPED --

03:24:09.037 --> 03:24:13.408 region:rollup2
IN THE IN THE IN THE NIGHT TIME.

03:24:11.673 --> 03:24:15.143 region:rollup2
WE DON'T HAVE THAT CAPABILITY

03:24:13.408 --> 03:24:17.612 region:rollup2
TODAY -- BUT

03:24:15.143 --> 03:24:18.980 region:rollup2

TO REPLACE OUR HELICOPTER FLEET

03:24:25.253 --> 03:24:28.590 region:rollup2
ALL OF THOSE HELICOPTER WILL

03:24:27.055 --> 03:24:31.092 region:rollup2
HAVE THAT CAPABILITY.

03:24:28.590 --> 03:24:36.164 region:rollup2
AND SEVERAL OF THEM WILL BE --

OF CALIFORNIA WILL ALL HAVE THE

03:24:43.104 --> 03:24:47.709 region:rollup2
CAPABILITY --

03:24:44.672 --> 03:24:49.811 region:rollup2

REGIONALLY --

03:24:52.680 --> 03:24:55.583 region:rollup2
DISTRIBUTED THE RATE LIMITING

03:24:53.882 --> 03:24:57.318 region:rollup2
STEP TO HAVING FIXED WING BEING

03:24:55.583 --> 03:24:58.787 region:rollup2
ABLE TO FLY OR NOT FLY AT NIGHT

03:24:57.318 --> 03:25:00.488 region:rollup2
ISN'T BASED ON THE AGE OF ARE

03:24:58.787 --> 03:25:02.190 region:rollup2
FLYING INFRASTRUCTURE OR ARE

03:25:00.488 --> 03:25:03.258 region:rollup2
THERE FIXED WING AIRCRAFT OUT

03:25:02.190 --> 03:25:03.958 region:rollup2
THERE AND OTHER PARTS OF THE

03:25:03.258 --> 03:25:05.426 region:rollup2
COUNTRY.

03:25:03.958 --> 03:25:06.895 region:rollup2
DO FLY AT NIGHT BECAUSE THEY

03:25:05.426 --> 03:25:09.998 region:rollup2
HAVE THAT ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY.

03:25:06.895 --> 03:25:13.668 region:rollup2
THERE ARE NOT --

03:25:09.998 --> 03:25:15.870 region:rollup2
READILY AVAILABLE --

03:25:13.668 --> 03:25:17.438 region:rollup2
FIXED WING AIRCRAFT THAT DO FIRE

03:25:15.870 --> 03:25:19.607 region:rollup2
FIGHTING --

03:25:17.438 --> 03:25:21.543 region:rollup2
LIKE DROPPING ANYTHING OUT OF

03:25:19.607 --> 03:25:23.311 region:rollup2
THE AIR AT NIGHT THAT ARE

03:25:21.543 --> 03:25:24.445 region:rollup2
AVAILABLE TO OKAY SO WOULD WE

03:25:23.311 --> 03:25:25.547 region:rollup2
NEED MORE THE HELICOPTERS

03:25:24.445 --> 03:25:28.883 region:rollup2
WHATEVER WE CAN GET THOSE

03:25:25.547 --> 03:25:31.419 region:rollup2
HELICOPTERS AND THEN LASTLY --

NOTHING WRONG WITH STEALING A

03:25:41.396 --> 03:25:43.798 region:rollup2
GOOD IDEA FROM SOMEBODY ELSE.

03:25:43.198 --> 03:25:44.933 region:rollup2
I THINK WE ALL NEED TO LEARN

03:25:43.798 --> 03:25:46.835 region:rollup2
FROM YOUR VERY POSITIVE

CONCEIVABLE I ACTUALLY HAD MORE

03:26:17.432 --> 03:26:19.634 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS AS WELL BUT WILL

03:26:19.033 --> 03:26:21.135 region:rollup2

LIKE TO DO AS WELL POSSIBLE.

03:26:28.543 --> 03:26:31.579 region:rollup2
SO I KNOW RUN SHORT ON TIME BUT

03:26:30.345 --> 03:26:32.881 region:rollup2
JUST A COMMENT FIRST TO PRESENT

03:26:31.579 --> 03:26:33.448 region:rollup2
PICKER YOU MENTIONED THAT.

03:26:32.881 --> 03:26:36.117 region:rollup2
IT'S THE LEGISLATURE THAT'S

03:26:33.448 --> 03:26:37.585 region:rollup2
DIRECTING.

03:26:36.117 --> 03:26:38.987 region:rollup2
SAYS THAT WERE DIRECTED A LOT OF

03:26:37.585 --> 03:26:40.221 region:rollup2
THESE THINGS BETWEEN POLLS BUT

03:26:38.987 --> 03:26:41.956 region:rollup2
AS A REGISTERED CIVIL ENGINEER I

03:26:40.221 --> 03:26:43.725 region:rollup2
WOULD NEVER.

03:26:41.956 --> 03:26:44.626 region:rollup2
JUST SAY PUT THAT ON THAT TOLD

03:26:43.725 --> 03:26:46.027 region:rollup2
ME WE SHOULD HAVE SOME

03:26:44.626 --> 03:26:46.928 region:rollup2
ENGINEERING STANDARDS WE SHOULD

03:26:46.027 --> 03:26:48.196 region:rollup2
HAVE ENGINEERS ARE LOOKING AT

03:26:46.928 --> 03:26:49.597 region:rollup2
THESE POLLS.

03:26:48.196 --> 03:26:51.332 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I REALLY DON'T THINK

03:26:49.597 --> 03:26:52.400 region:rollup2
THAT'S THAT'S SO UNFAIR EXCUSE

03:26:51.332 --> 03:26:53.034 region:rollup2
IF IF THAT'S THE REASON THAT'S

03:26:52.400 --> 03:26:55.870 region:rollup2
HAPPENING WE NEED TO CHANGE OUR

03:26:53.034 --> 03:26:57.372 region:rollup2
FIRST. TWO WE DO DO THAT BUT I'M

03:26:55.870 --> 03:26:59.407 region:rollup2
JUST POINTING OUT THAT THERE ARE

03:26:57.372 --> 03:27:01.476 region:rollup2
FREE CALL THE UNAUTHORIZED

03:26:59.407 --> 03:27:02.810 region:rollup2
ATTACHMENTS THAT TAKE TIME TO

03:27:01.476 --> 03:27:05.013 region:rollup2
CATCH IN THERE'S A THERE'S A

03:27:02.810 --> 03:27:06.447 region:rollup2
SLOW PROCESS FOR THE TELCOS TO

03:27:05.013 --> 03:27:07.849 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY CATCH UP TO THE

03:27:06.447 --> 03:27:09.784 region:rollup2
ELECTRIC UTILITIES WE THINK

03:27:07.849 --> 03:27:10.885 region:rollup2
THAT'S A PROBLEM.

03:27:09.784 --> 03:27:12.153 region:rollup2
I DO THINK THAT.

03:27:10.885 --> 03:27:16.591 region:rollup2
WE SHOULD POINT OUT THE LAST

03:27:12.153 --> 03:27:18.259 region:rollup2
YEAR THE LEGISLATURE ACTUALLY --

03:27:16.591 --> 03:27:20.228 region:rollup2
ADOPTED LEGISLATION THAT WOULD

03:27:18.259 --> 03:27:22.163 region:rollup2
HAVE PREEMPTED LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

03:27:20.228 --> 03:27:23.865 region:rollup2
ABILITY TO LIMIT WHAT'S ON POLLS

03:27:22.163 --> 03:27:24.899 region:rollup2
THAT THEY OWN AND OPERATE.

03:27:23.865 --> 03:27:26.567 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THAT THERE'S A VERY

03:27:24.899 --> 03:27:28.536 region:rollup2
AGGRESSIVE EFFORT AT THE FEDERAL

03:27:26.567 --> 03:27:30.638 region:rollup2
LEVEL TO ALSO --

03:27:28.536 --> 03:27:32.140 region:rollup2
PREEMPT STATE LAWS I THINK THERE

03:27:30.638 --> 03:27:34.342 region:rollup2
WILL ALWAYS BE ABLE TO PROTECT

03:27:32.140 --> 03:27:35.276 region:rollup2
OUR SAFETY STANDARDS BUT I THINK

03:27:34.342 --> 03:27:36.611 region:rollup2
THAT.

03:27:35.276 --> 03:27:38.413 region:rollup2
WHAT I'M TRYING TO DRIVE THAT IS

03:27:36.611 --> 03:27:39.747 region:rollup2
THERE'S A HUNGER FOR MORE

03:27:38.413 --> 03:27:41.449 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE TO BE ON THOSE

03:27:39.747 --> 03:27:43.584 region:rollup2
SPORTS THAT NETWORK THAT I

03:27:41.449 --> 03:27:44.085 region:rollup2
DESCRIBED?

03:27:43.584 --> 03:27:45.687 region:rollup2
HAS MORE VALUE.

03:27:44.085 --> 03:27:48.957 region:rollup2
THEN WE SEE.

03:27:45.687 --> 03:27:50.291 region:rollup2
AND WE THINK AND IT'S TIGHTLY

03:27:48.957 --> 03:27:51.759 region:rollup2
CONTESTED SPACE AND THERE'S

03:27:50.291 --> 03:27:52.560 region:rollup2
ALWAYS GONNA BE COMPETITION

03:27:51.759 --> 03:27:54.395 region:rollup2
CROWDING.

03:27:52.560 --> 03:27:55.797 region:rollup2
AND I UNDERSTAND IT IF A CITY OR

03:27:54.395 --> 03:27:56.397 region:rollup2
ANYBODY DIRECTED ME AS AN

03:27:55.797 --> 03:27:57.532 region:rollup2
ENGINEER TO DO SOMETHING THAT

03:27:56.397 --> 03:27:58.866 region:rollup2
WAS NOT SAFE.

03:27:57.532 --> 03:28:00.134 region:rollup2
I WOULD NOT DO IT IF I DID I

03:27:58.866 --> 03:28:01.703 region:rollup2
WOULD BE PERSONALLY RESPONSIBLE

03:28:00.134 --> 03:28:03.271 region:rollup2
I THINK THE UTILITIES GENERALLY

03:28:01.703 --> 03:28:04.739 region:rollup2
DO THAT ONE OF MY CONCERNS

03:28:03.271 --> 03:28:06.541 region:rollup2
HOWEVER IS THE DESIGN STANDARDS

03:28:04.739 --> 03:28:08.710 region:rollup2
A CONSTANTLY CHANGING WE NEVER

03:28:06.541 --> 03:28:10.011 region:rollup2
EXPECTED TO SEE WINS AS

03:28:08.710 --> 03:28:11.546 region:rollup2
FEROCIOUS AS WE SAW IN NORTHERN

03:28:10.011 --> 03:28:11.979 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA WAS OUTSIDE THE TEST

03:28:11.546 --> 03:28:13.348 region:rollup2
THAT'S A DIFFERENT.

03:28:11.979 --> 03:28:14.782 region:rollup2
ISSUE I UNDERSTAND WITH BUT WE

03:28:13.348 --> 03:28:16.451 region:rollup2
NEED TO LOOK AT THAT.

03:28:14.782 --> 03:28:18.486 region:rollup2
AND THEN SHE PUT I THINK YOU YOU

03:28:16.451 --> 03:28:20.722 region:rollup2
ADDRESS THIS IDENTIFIES OWN NOW

03:28:18.486 --> 03:28:22.557 region:rollup2
BUT ARE THERE THINGS THAT ARE

03:28:20.722 --> 03:28:23.658 region:rollup2
NOT.

03:28:22.557 --> 03:28:24.592 region:rollup2
THAT THERE ARE OTHER BARRIERS

03:28:23.658 --> 03:28:26.794 region:rollup2
THAT ARE EITHER KEEPING US FROM

03:28:24.592 --> 03:28:28.763 region:rollup2
FROM SENDING THE FORCE PERMIT

03:28:26.794 --> 03:28:29.697 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENTS SEEK REQUIREMENTS.

03:28:28.763 --> 03:28:30.264 region:rollup2
THEY'RE MAKING SOMETHING THAT

03:28:29.697 --> 03:28:32.633 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE ABLE TO BE DONE

03:28:30.264 --> 03:28:34.235 region:rollup2
QUICKLY TAKING A LONG TIME OR

03:28:32.633 --> 03:28:35.803 region:rollup2
NOT BEING ABLE TO DO LONG LIKE A

03:28:34.235 --> 03:28:36.904 region:rollup2
SENATOR HUESO WITH WITH THE

03:28:35.803 --> 03:28:38.539 region:rollup2
GOATS.

03:28:36.904 --> 03:28:40.108 region:rollup2
AND THANK YOU FOR COMING BACK TO

03:28:38.539 --> 03:28:42.143 region:rollup2
THAT SUBJECT --

03:28:40.108 --> 03:28:43.478 region:rollup2
WHAT WHAT WHAT I WANT TO TIE I

03:28:42.143 --> 03:28:47.448 region:rollup2
WANT TO TIE?

03:28:43.478 --> 03:28:49.517 region:rollup2
YOUR QUESTION --

03:28:47.448 --> 03:28:51.986 region:rollup2
SENATOR STONE'S QUESTION.

03:28:49.517 --> 03:28:54.288 region:rollup2
AND BOTH THE ASSEMBLY MEMBERS

03:28:51.986 --> 03:28:56.357 region:rollup2
DOLLY AND AND WHAT'S QUESTIONS

03:28:54.288 --> 03:28:59.827 region:rollup2
BACK TOGETHER --

03:28:56.357 --> 03:29:03.064 region:rollup2
AND ANSWER.

03:28:59.827 --> 03:29:05.867 region:rollup2
THE THAT IS AN ISSUE THERE THERE

03:29:03.064 --> 03:29:07.668 region:rollup2
IS A PROCESS THAT TAKES TIME --

03:29:05.867 --> 03:29:08.770 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENTALLY TO CLEAR

03:29:07.668 --> 03:29:10.638 region:rollup2
PROJECTS ON THE STATE

03:29:08.770 --> 03:29:12.106 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBILITY AREA.

03:29:10.638 --> 03:29:14.208 region:rollup2
THE THEIR IS --

03:29:12.106 --> 03:29:15.743 region:rollup2
FEDERAL PROCESS THROUGH NEPA --

03:29:14.208 --> 03:29:17.779 region:rollup2
THAT THAT TAKES TIME ON THE

03:29:15.743 --> 03:29:20.381 region:rollup2
FEDERAL LANDS --

03:29:17.779 --> 03:29:23.451 region:rollup2
ALL OF THESE PROCESSES ARE BEING

03:29:20.381 --> 03:29:25.453 region:rollup2
LOOKED AT FOR STREAMLINING AND

03:29:23.451 --> 03:29:27.088 region:rollup2
ENTER INTER AGENCY COLLABORATION

03:29:25.453 --> 03:29:29.157 region:rollup2
ACROSS FEDERAL STATE.

03:29:27.088 --> 03:29:31.225 region:rollup2
AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT --

03:29:29.157 --> 03:29:33.261 region:rollup2
AGENCIES AND GROUPS --

03:29:31.225 --> 03:29:34.295 region:rollup2
THROUGH THE THE NEWLY CREATED

03:29:33.261 --> 03:29:36.731 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR'S --

03:29:34.295 --> 03:29:38.1000 region:rollup2
FORCE MANAGEMENT TASK --

03:29:36.731 --> 03:29:40.501 region:rollup2
THAT WAS BORN OUT OF A BIGGER

03:29:38.1000 --> 03:29:42.069 region:rollup2
NEED STATE WHY.

03:29:40.501 --> 03:29:43.704 region:rollup2
THAT WAS IDENTIFIED DURING THE

03:29:42.069 --> 03:29:44.238 region:rollup2
TREE MORTALITY TASK FORCE DAYS

03:29:43.704 --> 03:29:46.374 region:rollup2
OF THE LAST TWO AND A HALF

03:29:44.238 --> 03:29:49.010 region:rollup2
YEARS.%

03:29:46.374 --> 03:29:51.813 region:rollup2
AND SO THOSE EFFORTS ARE GOING

03:29:49.010 --> 03:29:55.316 region:rollup2
TO BE EXPANDING TO ADDRESS SOME

03:29:51.813 --> 03:29:55.950 region:rollup2
OF THE REGULATORY.

03:29:55.316 --> 03:29:58.453 region:rollup2
CONCERNS THAT YOU MENTIONED --

03:29:55.950 --> 03:29:59.086 region:rollup2
AND DAY THE MOVEMENT FORWARD OF

03:29:58.453 --> 03:30:02.323 region:rollup2
OF THAT FOREST HEALTH INITIATIVE

03:29:59.086 --> 03:30:04.392 region:rollup2
--

03:30:02.323 --> 03:30:05.159 region:rollup2
STATEWIDE OKAY WOULD LIKE US TO

03:30:04.392 --> 03:30:06.327 region:rollup2
TALK ABOUT THAT AS A COMMITTEE

03:30:05.159 --> 03:30:07.829 region:rollup2
AS WELL FOR LOOKING AT MAYBE

03:30:06.327 --> 03:30:09.230 region:rollup2
SHIFTING SOME OF THE BURDEN TO

03:30:07.829 --> 03:30:10.331 region:rollup2
RATEPAYERS OR OTHER THINGS THAT

03:30:09.230 --> 03:30:11.532 region:rollup2
WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT WAYS TO

03:30:10.331 --> 03:30:13.367 region:rollup2
EXPEDITE THIS [inaudible]

03:30:11.532 --> 03:30:15.136 region:rollup2
AND THEN.

03:30:13.367 --> 03:30:16.370 region:rollup2
THE ISSUES THAT I UNDERSTAND

03:30:15.136 --> 03:30:18.039 region:rollup2
OCCUR WE'RE TRYING TO FEND THE

03:30:16.370 --> 03:30:18.639 region:rollup2
FOREST IS WHAT DO WE DO WITH

03:30:18.039 --> 03:30:20.241 region:rollup2
THOSE TREES ONCE WE TAKE THEM

03:30:18.639 --> 03:30:22.210 region:rollup2
DOWN.

03:30:20.241 --> 03:30:23.678 region:rollup2
IS BIOMASS ON THEM JUST ASK THE

03:30:22.210 --> 03:30:26.314 region:rollup2
QUESTION ANYBODY CAN ANSWER BUT

03:30:23.678 --> 03:30:27.815 region:rollup2
WOOD IS BIOMASS A IMPORTANT PART

03:30:26.314 --> 03:30:29.350 region:rollup2
OF THAT TOO WILL KNOW INDICATE

03:30:27.815 --> 03:30:31.219 region:rollup2
THAT ON OCCASION EVEN GROUND UP

03:30:29.350 --> 03:30:32.720 region:rollup2
INTO SPREAD BUT THERE ARE SO

03:30:31.219 --> 03:30:33.087 region:rollup2
MANY TREES WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO

03:30:32.720 --> 03:30:35.022 region:rollup2
WITH ALL THIS.

03:30:33.087 --> 03:30:36.324 region:rollup2
ALL ALL THESE TREES WERE TO BE

03:30:35.022 --> 03:30:37.892 region:rollup2
TAKEN DOWN.

03:30:36.324 --> 03:30:40.361 region:rollup2
I'LL ANSWER FROM FROM THE

03:30:37.892 --> 03:30:42.230 region:rollup2
PERSPECTIVE OF CAL FIRE IN.

03:30:40.361 --> 03:30:44.198 region:rollup2
FORCE MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE THAT

03:30:42.230 --> 03:30:46.133 region:rollup2
IS BEING LOOKED AT AS ONE OF THE

03:30:44.198 --> 03:30:48.836 region:rollup2
OPTIONS FOR AN OUTLOOK BIOMASS

03:30:46.133 --> 03:30:50.671 region:rollup2
FOR THAT MATERIAL --

03:30:48.836 --> 03:30:53.040 region:rollup2
TYPICALLY WE LOOK AT A HIERARCHY

03:30:50.671 --> 03:30:55.476 region:rollup2
OF THE THAT THE HIGHEST AND BEST

03:30:53.040 --> 03:30:57.078 region:rollup2
USE OF THE MATERIAL FIRST AND

03:30:55.476 --> 03:31:00.014 region:rollup2
BURNING IT UP OR TURNING IT INTO

03:30:57.078 --> 03:31:01.415 region:rollup2
POWER ARE LOWER ON THAT ON THAT.

03:31:00.014 --> 03:31:03.284 region:rollup2
KIND OF GOOD CONTINUUM.

03:31:01.415 --> 03:31:04.785 region:rollup2
BUT A LOT OF THE MATERIAL THAT'S

03:31:03.284 --> 03:31:06.821 region:rollup2
THE ONLY --

03:31:04.785 --> 03:31:08.456 region:rollup2
THE ONLY POSSIBLE --

03:31:06.821 --> 03:31:10.091 region:rollup2
OUTLET FOR IT SO --

03:31:08.456 --> 03:31:11.893 region:rollup2
I'LL I'LL LEAVE IT AT THAT FROM

03:31:10.091 --> 03:31:13.194 region:rollup2
THE FOREST MANAGEMENT TESTABLE

03:31:11.893 --> 03:31:13.828 region:rollup2
ISSUE RESPECTIVELY THAT'S

03:31:13.194 --> 03:31:15.429 region:rollup2
SUFFICIENT THEY CAN THEN LASTLY

03:31:13.828 --> 03:31:16.998 region:rollup2
--

03:31:15.429 --> 03:31:17.965 region:rollup2
MISTER D'AGOSTINO.

03:31:16.998 --> 03:31:19.200 region:rollup2
SO.

03:31:17.965 --> 03:31:20.401 region:rollup2
I'M VERY EXCITED ABOUT WHAT YOU

03:31:19.200 --> 03:31:22.203 region:rollup2
GUYS ARE DOING I THINK WE SHOULD

03:31:20.401 --> 03:31:23.271 region:rollup2
LOOK AT IT AS STATEWIDE.

03:31:22.203 --> 03:31:24.038 region:rollup2
PERSPECTIVE.

03:31:23.271 --> 03:31:26.307 region:rollup2
BUT I JUST HAVE TO IMAGINE IF

03:31:24.038 --> 03:31:27.141 region:rollup2
YOU'RE GOING TO DO.

03:31:26.307 --> 03:31:30.311 region:rollup2
AND IF YOU'RE ABLE TO REROUTE

03:31:27.141 --> 03:31:32.013 region:rollup2
POWER TO TO THOSE HOMES REVIEW

03:31:30.311 --> 03:31:33.414 region:rollup2
DE ENERGIZED THEY HAVE NO POWER.

03:31:32.013 --> 03:31:35.383 region:rollup2
AND HOW HAS THE RESPONSE BEEN

03:31:33.414 --> 03:31:37.718 region:rollup2
FROM FROM THE CUSTOMER.

03:31:35.383 --> 03:31:39.453 region:rollup2
WELL WE'VE WE'VE GONE OUT EVEN

03:31:37.718 --> 03:31:41.923 region:rollup2
SENSE THE EVENT IN DECEMBER AND

03:31:39.453 --> 03:31:43.624 region:rollup2
HOWLED TOWN HALL MEETINGS AND

03:31:41.923 --> 03:31:44.959 region:rollup2
ALL OF THE AFFECTED COMMUNITIES

03:31:43.624 --> 03:31:46.527 region:rollup2
AND WE'RE REALLY TRYING TO FIND

03:31:44.959 --> 03:31:48.162 region:rollup2
WAYS THAT WE CAN TRY TO MITIGATE

03:31:46.527 --> 03:31:49.897 region:rollup2
THAT IMPACT. ONE OF THEM THAT

03:31:48.162 --> 03:31:51.632 region:rollup2
WE'RE LOOKING AT NOW IS RESOURCE

03:31:49.897 --> 03:31:54.435 region:rollup2
CENTERS SO PREDETERMINED

03:31:51.632 --> 03:31:56.170 region:rollup2
LOCATIONS AND WE PUT THE

03:31:54.435 --> 03:31:57.305 region:rollup2
ENGINEERING EQUIPMENT THAT NEEDS

03:31:56.170 --> 03:31:59.307 region:rollup2
TO BE THERE THAT WE CAN.

03:31:57.305 --> 03:32:01.475 region:rollup2
HAVE A GENERATOR. TO TRY TO

03:31:59.307 --> 03:32:03.244 region:rollup2
PROVIDE THIS FOR THESE LOCATIONS

03:32:01.475 --> 03:32:03.945 region:rollup2
WE HAVE OTHER DOWNTOWN AREAS

03:32:03.244 --> 03:32:05.780 region:rollup2
WHERE THERE ARE DIFFERENT

03:32:03.945 --> 03:32:07.014 region:rollup2
ENGINEERING SWITCHING PLANS AND

03:32:05.780 --> 03:32:10.318 region:rollup2
OTHER THINGS THAT ARE DONE.

03:32:07.014 --> 03:32:12.253 region:rollup2
ON TO TRY TO RE ROUTE AROUND.

03:32:10.318 --> 03:32:15.456 region:rollup2
PARTICULARLY HIGH RISK AREAS AND

03:32:12.253 --> 03:32:18.025 region:rollup2
WE LEARNED A LOT IN DECEMBER ON

03:32:15.456 --> 03:32:19.393 region:rollup2
ABOUT HOW THIS WHOLE --

03:32:18.025 --> 03:32:21.495 region:rollup2
AND DE ENERGIZE ATION PLANNED

03:32:19.393 --> 03:32:22.763 region:rollup2
CAN PLAY OUT SO WE'RE ADDING

03:32:21.495 --> 03:32:24.098 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL SWITCHING TO THE

03:32:22.763 --> 03:32:26.400 region:rollup2
SYSTEM ADDING ADDITIONAL WEATHER

03:32:24.098 --> 03:32:28.736 region:rollup2
STATIONS TO TRY TO MINIMIZE THE

03:32:26.400 --> 03:32:29.337 region:rollup2
CUSTOMER IMPACT WHEREVER WE CAN

03:32:28.736 --> 03:32:31.372 region:rollup2
SO IT'S A CONTINUOUS EVOLUTION

03:32:29.337 --> 03:32:33.274 region:rollup2
--

03:32:31.372 --> 03:32:35.109 region:rollup2
WHERE YOU KNOW EVERY YEAR WE SEE

03:32:33.274 --> 03:32:37.578 region:rollup2
MORE SAN AND AS WE LEARN MORE

03:32:35.109 --> 03:32:39.146 region:rollup2
AND THEN WE FIND ENGINEERING AND

03:32:37.578 --> 03:32:40.014 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS TO TRY TO

03:32:39.146 --> 03:32:41.549 region:rollup2
ADDRESS IT?

03:32:40.014 --> 03:32:42.984 region:rollup2
AND MINIMIZE THE IMPACT TO THE

03:32:41.549 --> 03:32:44.452 region:rollup2
CUSTOMERS SO THAT'S HOW WE'RE

03:32:42.984 --> 03:32:45.686 region:rollup2
CONTINUING TO APPROACH THIS

03:32:44.452 --> 03:32:46.854 region:rollup2
MOVING FORWARD APPRECIATE THAT

03:32:45.686 --> 03:32:48.222 region:rollup2
SO BUT WHAT HAS BEEN THE

03:32:46.854 --> 03:32:49.523 region:rollup2
RESPONSE FROM THE CUSTOMERS IF

03:32:48.222 --> 03:32:51.692 region:rollup2
THEY LOSE POWER.

03:32:49.523 --> 03:32:53.394 region:rollup2
AYE IT IS BEEN MIXED SOME PEOPLE

03:32:51.692 --> 03:32:55.496 region:rollup2
HAVE SAID THANK YOU --
