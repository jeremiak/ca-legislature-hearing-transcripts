JUDICIARY WILL. IN. AN WE ON OUR FIRST ITEM ON THE AGENDA. IS OUR OVERVIEW ON THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION AND SO WE WILL RECEIVE THAT FROM OUR ACTING SECRETARY RAFI IS -- DO WE NEED TO DO ROLL CALL YEAH COLLEGES I DARE YOU PLEASE NO NO PLEASE SAID WE'LL DO ROLL CALL. CENTER SKINNER I AM HERE CENTER MORLOCK. CENTER ABOUT. RIGHT PLEASE FORGET ALL RIGHT THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR WOMAN MEMBERS I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE INVITATION TO COME IN. AND GO OVER THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AS ACTING SECRETARY I WOULD LIKE TO SHARE WITH YOU. SOME OF THE CHANGES THAT I'VE SEEN THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AS I BEGAN MY CAREER IN NINETEEN NINETY ONE AS A CORRECTIONAL OFFICER. WHEN THE POPULATION WITH ABOUT A -- HUNDRED THOUSAND SIXTEEN YEARS LATER I WAS A CAPTAIN ON FACILITY WHEN THAT THE POPULATION GREW AND IT WAS AT ITS HEIGHT AT A HUNDRED SEVENTY THREE THOUSAND SO I'VE SEEN. THE CHANGES IN THIS POPULATION AND MORE POORLY THE IMPACTS OF OF THAT TYPE OF GROWTH IN. OUR INABILITY TO DO CERTAIN THINGS WITH THAT AMOUNT OF POPULATION IS A HUNDRED TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE. NINETEEN NINETY FIVE AND THIS IS BEEN MADE POSSIBLE IS A HUNDRED AND WE JUST SAY THAT NUMBER AGAIN. THE DAYS POPULATION IS UNDER A HUNDRED TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND AND THAT'S BEEN THE FIRST TIME SINCE -- NINETEEN NINETY FIVE AND THAT'S BEEN MADE POSSIBLE BY NUMEROUS THINGS BUT I THINK ONE OF THE BIGGEST IMPACTS HAS BEEN PROPOSITION. FIFTY SEVEN WHICH IS EMPLOYMENT WHICH IS VOTED BY THE VOTERS IN TWO THOUSAND AND SIXTEEN AND WE'VE. HAD AND IN IMPLEMENTATION -- AND ONE OF THE FACTORS AND ONE OF THE KEY THINGS THAT IN THAT PROPOSITION AND ALLOW THE SECRETARY. TO AWARD CREDIT INMATES FOR PARTICIPATION IN REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMS WHICH PREVIOUSLY REQUIRED -- CHANGES IN A LONG. WHAT PROPOSITION FIFTY SEVEN DID FOR US WE HAVE SEEN THAT TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND NONVIOLENT DETERMINE THE SENTENCE INMATES BECAME ELIGIBLE FOR PAROLE SUITABILITY UNDER THE NONVIOLENT PRO PROCESS? CDC ARE ALSO ALSO IMPLEMENTED REGULATIONS THAT ALLOWED INMATES TO EARN CREDITS IN VARIOUS GAMES WHETHER IT BE THROUGH -- TRADITIONAL IN MADE -- LEISURE TIME ACTIVITY GROUPS THE REHABILITATIVE ACHIEVEMENT TYPE GROUPS AND SELF HELP IN OTHER WORDS JUST IN MORE SIMPLE TERMS AND THROUGH MORE A IN A MORE RIGOROUS WAY BUT BASED ON THOSE CREDIT EARNINGS WHAT WE HAVE SEEN. IS THAT INMATES [inaudible] HAVE BEEN. THEY HAVE EARNED AND I LIKE TO SAY THAT EARNED BECAUSE NOTHING'S GIVEN TO THEM THEY'VE EARNED FOUR POINT EIGHT MILLION CREDITS AND WHAT THAT TRANSLATES. TO IS THIRTEEN THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED NINETY SIX PRISON YEARS HAVE COME OFFICE SENTENCES BASED ON THAT. THE INMATES EARNING THAT. IMAGE PARTICIPATED IN HIGH SCHOOL AND COLLEGE PROGRAMS THE DIPLOMAS AND RIGHT NOW -- THEY HAVE EARNED NEARLY NINE THOUSAND FIVE WORDS AND THAT TRANSLATES INTO TWO THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED ELEVEN YEARS OFF OF PRISON SENTENCES. ALSO THEIR PARTICIPATION AND RIGOROUS CURRICULUM BASED PROGRAMS -- A CARD IN BEHAVIOR -- MILESTONE EARNINGS THEY HAVE ALSO EARNED TWO HUNDRED NINETEEN THOUSAND AND THAT THAT TRANSLATES ROUGHLY INTO NINE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED NINETY FIVE PRISON YEARS OFFICE SENTENCES. AND THESE ARE CREDITS THAT INMATES EARNED AND I THINK FOR ME THAT'S ONE OF THE BIGGEST CHANGES IN THE CULTURE CHANGES INSIDE PRISONS AND HELPED INMATES PROGRAM. AND PROGRAMS ARE FACILITATED INMATES IS THAT THEY EARN THEM -- WE NOW HAVE TWO THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED REHABILITATIVE ACHIEVEMENT CREDIT PROGRAMS AND WHAT THAT TRANSLATES INTO IS EIGHTY ONE THOUSAND OPPORTUNITIES SO YOU HAVE THE PROGRAMS AND THEN. EACH PROGRAM MAY HAVE VARIOUS OPPORTUNITIES FOR IMAGE TO PARTICIPATE AND WE HAVE ABOUT EIGHTY ONE THOUSAND SLOT SO EIGHTY ONE THOUSAND OPPORTUNITY FOR INMATES TO PARTICIPATE IN A PROGRAM. OUR GOAL IS TO OFFER A TOTAL OF OVER THREE THOUSAND RIGHT PROGRAMS BY THE END OF THIS FISCAL YEAR. ALSO LOOKING FOR TO CREATE PROGRAMS FOR INMATES WITH MENTAL AND MEDICAL HEALTH NEEDS TO INCENTIVIZE PARTICIPATION IN TREATMENT. WE'RE LOOKING TO LOOKING AT IMPLEMENTING A NURSING STAFF SPONSORED PATIENT. EDUCATION IN MADE ACTIVITY GROUP. AND THIS'LL HELP INMATES ASSIST IN ADDRESSING SOME OF THE MEDICAL MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS THAT I'LL BE JUST A SUPPORT GROUP FOR THE IN MY POPULATION. WE WANT TO DO THAT AT SEVERAL INSTITUTIONS. ALL THESE NUMBERS SAYING SEMEN PRESS OF THE FULL IMPACT OF PROP FIFTY SEVEN I BELIEVE WE HAVEN'T SEEN YET. BECAUSE I LIKE EARLY PROJECTIONS PROP -- THAT WE HAD IN THE PROP. THIRTY SIX THOSE TWO IDENTIFY TO ADDRESS THE SPECIFIC NEEDS FOR A PRETTY DESIGNATED GROUP OF INMATES. PROP. FIFTY SEVEN IMPACTS THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE INMATE POPULATION -- AND THEY'RE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IMPACT THEIR DATES IN REHABILITATION BASED ON PROGRAM AVAILABILITY. BASED ON SENTENCING COMPLEXITY AND I BELIEVE MORE IMPORTANT ONE THE INDIVIDUAL CHOICE THAT IT AND MAKE CHOOSES TO MAKE TO PURSUE THESE REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMS. I WHAT I DO KNOW IS THAT OFFENDERS RELEASED SINCE PROPOSITION FIFTY SEVEN ON AVERAGE HAVE REDUCED OUR SENTENCES BY ONE HUNDRED TWENTY DAYS. WHAT THAT DOES FOR US INSIDE THE PRISON POPULATION ITSELF IT ENCOURAGES HOPE IT ENCOURAGES INMATES TO SEE THAT THE THESE THE THEIR EFFORTS WORK? BUT ALSO THE STAFF SEE THAT IT WORKS IN STAFF RECOGNIZE THAT THEY HELP FACILITATE THESE PROGRAMS WHICH ALSO. IMPACTS THE THE NEED A CULTURE CHANGE. UPDATE ON FIFTY SEVEN WE SUBMITTED -- REGULATIONS EMERGENCY REGULATIONS LAST DECEMBER -- TO AMEND THE REGULATIONS WHICH ARE CURRENTLY IN EFFECT AND THAT WILL BE GOING OUT FOR PUBLIC COMMENT HERE IN THE NEAR FUTURE THE THESE -- AUGMENTED RAGS. THEY'RE GOING TO BE AUG EARLY FOR THE EDUCATION AND THE REHABILITATIVE ACHIEVEMENT CREDIT PIECE TO INCREASE THEM. ALSO IT WILL EXPAND THE NONVIOLENT PROCONSULS FOR THIRD STRIKERS DUE TO RECENT LITIGATION. ALSO ONE MAY I ASK WHAT WHITE WHY YOU HAVEN'T AUGMENT THE CREDIT PIECE BECAUSE WHAT WE FOUND IS SINCE WE FIRST IMPLEMENTED AS ANYTHING NEW THAT YOU. IMPLEMENT WHAT WERE FOUND IS THAT -- THE INMATES WHOSE DATES CHANGE BECAUSE THEY ARE DETERMINED HE SENTENCED ABOUT 46% WERE ONLY ABLE TO EARN THOSE CREDITS BECAUSE THE REMAINING INMATES IN THOSE PROGRAMS WERE LIFERS. AND THOSE DATES REALLY DIDN'T IMPACT LIFE FOR DATES SO WILL YOU COULD CALCULATE RELEASE STATES. A DECISION WAS MADE EARLY ON AND I BELIEVE IT'S THE RIGHT DECISION AND I THINK IT'S A GOOD DECISION NOW NOT TO REMOVE THESE LIFERS BECAUSE LIFERS NEED THEM. LIFERS ARE STABLE POPULATION IN PRISON -- THEY ALSO -- INCENTIVIZE HOPE TO THE OTHER INMATES ENCOURAGING TO PARTICIPATE SO BECAUSE OF THAT WE'RE LOOKING TO INCREASE THE CREDITS ELIGIBLE -- FOR PARTICIPATION IN THESE REHABILITATE ACHIEVEMENT CREDITS AND MILESTONE PROGRAMS. I DO TAKE CARD IN THE MIDDLE OF ALL THESE VAST CHANGES AND CORRECTIONS THAT RECIDIVISM HAS STAYED STABLE. EVEN AS THE PRISON POPULATION IS LARGER AND THE PERCENTAGE OF SERIOUS AND VIOLENT OFFENDERS IN PRISON. AS INCREASED. OFFENDERS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO EARN THEIR FREE SIX MONTHS OR EVEN YEARS -- THAN THE EARLIER WHAT HAPPENED FOR ME AGAIN I KEEP ON USING THIS TERM. THERE IS HOPE THAT THE INMATES SEE THAT THEIR PARTICIPATION IN THESE PROGRAMS DO WORK. HOWEVER WE ARE CONSTANTLY WORKING TO IMPROVE THIS RATE AND ALLOW MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR OFFENDERS. OR OFFICER RESEARCH IS CONDUCTED AN ASSESSMENT ON THE IMPACT OF SPECIFIC PROGRAMS AND WHAT THEY DISCOVERED THAT. THE RECIDIVISM RATE FOR FRAWLEY'S WITH THE TREATMENT NEED WHO ARE RECEIVED IMPRISONED SUBSTANCE ABUSE PROGRAM WAS THIRTY EIGHT POINT 5%. COMPARED TO THE FORTY ONE POINT FOUR WHO DID NOT RECEIVE THIS TREATMENT -- THE ONE YOUR CONVICTION RATE FOR OFFENDERS WHO EARNED EDUCATION MERIT CREDITS THESE OF THE EDUCATION AND COLLEGE -- THERE A THE ONE YOUR CONVICTION REFER THEM WAS 9%. IN TWO THOUSAND ON 9% IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN ALTHOUGH THESE AREN'T IT'S NOT APPLE TO APPLE COMPARISON WE HAVE SEEN THE DIFFERENCE IN THE CHANGES BASED ON THESE -- RECIDIVISM NUMBERS BASED ON PARTICIPATION IN THESE CREDITS -- WE ALSO TOOK A LOOK AT NINE HUNDRED AND REQUIREMENTS WE HAVE HAD A ONE YOUR CONVICTION RATE OF NINE POINT FIVE THE THESE ARE ENCOURAGING NUMBERS. WE SEE IN MOST PARTICIPATING WE SEE THEM CHANGING AND FOR US THAT'S A GOOD THING. FOR THE MORE CITIES YOUR POPULATION PROJECTIONS PREDICT THAT THE ADULT POPULATION. IS. TO CONTINUE TO DECREASE BUT NOT AT THE RATE WE INITIALLY EXPECTED -- THE FALL OF TWENTY TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN PROJECTIONS ARE BASED ON A 1% HIGHER THAN ANTICIPATED IN SPRING TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN REPORT REPORT MAINLY BECAUSE OF THE FIFTY OF THE PROFIT THE SEVEN OF ENHANCEMENT EARNING CREDITS I DESCRIBED EARLIER WITH THE RACKS IN THE MILESTONES. THAT SKEWED THAT'S WOULD BUMP THE NUMBER UP BY 1% AND 1% WITH THESE NUMBERS IS AN INCREASE OF BILLS YOU SOME PROJECTIONS. DON'T HAVE ACHIEVEMENT CREDITS. IN POINT IN TIME DATA LIFERS EARNED ONE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY ONE RACK CREDITS. AND THE NON LIFERS AREN'T SIXTEEN THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE THAT 44% THOSE OF THE NUMBERS EXPLAINED EARLY ON WHY IT WAS OFF. THAT'S WHY WE AMENDED THESE -- REGULATIONS -- BUT I'D BE REMISS IF I DID TAKE A MOMENT TO REMIND THE COMMITTEE THAT WE ARE STILL SUBJECT TO THE THREE JUDGE PANEL ONE THIRTY SEVEN POINT FIVE NUMBER -- THATPOPCAP WE'VE BEEN UNDER SINCE TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN BUT WE MUST -- STILL MONITOR THE POPULATION TODAY WE ARE AT THREE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED AND FORTY TO BE LOW THE POP CAP NUMBER BUT I ALSO NEED TO REMIND THAT WE ARE STILL WITH ABOUT FOURTEEN HUNDRED INMATES STILL IN ARIZONA -- WE THE GOAL TO HAVE THOSE INMATES BACK BY JUNE THIRTIETH OF THIS YEAR. WE ARE BRINGING BACK BETWEEN -- I THINK THE LAST TIME I SAW BETWEEN SEVENTY NINE AND A HUNDRED AND THIRTEEN INMATES A WEEK. AND WE ARE ON TRACK TO HAVE THEM BACK AND THAT'S THE GOAL. THE REASON WE DO NOT KEEP THE ORIGINAL TIME FRIENDS BECAUSE OF SOME OF THE BOB POP PROJECTIONS THAT I EXPLAINED EARLIER. AND THAT THE THOUGHT THAT WE WERE CONTINUE TO BRING THE BACK SOONER WE WOULD HAVE SEVERELY IMPACTED THE THREE JUDGE PANEL NUMBER WE WOULD HAVE BEEN. VERY CLOSE TO BEING OVER AND THAT'S NOT WHAT WE WANTED TO BE. A SEEMS LIKE A LOT -- THAT THE CUSHION THAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW -- BUT I DO NEED TO REMIND THAT -- NO THE QUESTION IS IN IS IS ROBUST AS I WE THAT WE WOULD LIKE BECAUSE WHAT WE RECOGNIZE AS ONE LEAKY ROOF ONE BAD COURT RULING. CHANGES IN SENTENCING ANYTHING COULD CHANGE HOW INMATES ARE RECEIVED IN THE INTO THE SYSTEM AND WE NEED TO BE COUNSELED MINDFUL OF THAT -- I RAISE THAT POINT BECAUSE EXCEEDS THE POPPED UP WE WILL BE UNDER THE COURT -- THE COURT MONITOR -- BUT I DENIED. I'LL JUST SAY THAT BUT WE DO HAVE SOME GOOD NEWS SO THE GOOD NEWS IS A DECADE AGO ONLY A QUARTER OF OUR INMATE. WAS HOUSE ON LEVEL TWO FACILITIES WHICH ARE LOWER LEVEL THERE'S MORE PROGRAMMING FOR THOSE INMATES THERE'S A MORE ACCESS MORE OPENNESS. BUT AS OF TODAY WE HAVE A OVER A THIRD 36% OF OUR POPULATION. IS IN THESE LOWER LEVEL FACILITIES THAT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE WHAT WE HAVE IS A DIFFERENT POPULATION THAN WE HAD. WE HAVE A MORE SERIOUS MORE VIOLENT POPULATION THAT COME IN BUT WE RECOGNIZE THAT AN INDIVIDUAL SHOULDN'T JUST BE HOUSE BASED ON THE CRIME THEY COMMITTED. IT'S A HOLISTIC APPROACH IN OUR HOUSING INMATES TO GET THEM AT THE LOWEST LEVEL. POSSIBLE SO WE CAN REACH THE REHABILITATIVE NEED. TOM I KNOW I'VE BEEN IN FRONT OF THE COMMITTEES LIKE THIS TO TALK ABOUT A SHOE POPULATIONS THERE WAS A TIME WHEN WE'RE POPULATION. WAS ABOUT FOUR THOUSAND NOW THAT NUMBERS UNDER. EIGHT HUNDRED AND SO THAT IS A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN OUR SYSTEM. THERE ARE ADMINISTRATIVE SEGREGATION UNITS -- THAT WE'RE AT ONE POINT AT ABOUT. EIGHT ONE THOUSAND UNKNOWN NUMBERS ARE TRENDING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION AND I THINK IT'S JUST THE WAY WE HAVE BEEN HOUSING AND UNDERSTANDING HOW INMATES NEEDS NEED TO BE MET. AND THAT WE NEED AND THE CLEARLY BEHAVIOR BASIN TAKEN INDIVIDUAL ON WHAT THEY'RE DOING NOT OUT WHAT THEY THINK THEY MAY OR MAY NOT DO [inaudible] ARM. A COUPLE OF OTHER HOUSING HAVE A POINT I WANT TO MAKE THE POPULATION IS THAT -- MOSER'S INVITES OFFENDER BUT I DO NEED TO SAY IT ON THE WOMEN'S PROGRAMS WE HAVE ALTERNATIVE CUSTODY PLACEMENTS. WE HAVE SIXTEEN WOMEN HOUSE AND PRIVATE RESIDENCE IN. SIXTEEN AND IT'S SIXTEEN HOUSES AND WE HAVE ANOTHER SIXTEEN HOUSE IN THE FEMALE OFFENDER TREATMENT AND EMPLOYMENT PROGRAMS -- SO IF YOU YOU SAID SIXTEEN WOMEN IN SIXTEEN HOUSES WELL THE WAY IT IS. WITH THE ALTERNATIVE CUSTODY PLACEMENTS. THEIR PLACE IN HOUSING THAT -- THAT IS APPROVED BY PAROLE SO TRADITIONALLY THEY'RE LIVING WITH LOVED ONES FRIENDS SO SIXTEEN OF THEM ARE LIVING IN THOSE HOUSES SO WE HAVE ONLY A POPULATION OF SIXTEEN OPERATIONS. IN ALL ALL LOOKS NO OUR WOMEN'S FACILITY IS OR ANYONE THAT'S ALMOST OVERCROWDING I I I I UNDERSTAND I DO WANT TO JUST AND ALSO -- WE ALSO HAVE FIVE CUSTODY COMMUNITY TRANSITIONAL REENTRY PROGRAMS FOR FEMALES AT FIVE LOCATIONS WHICH SERVE UP TO THREE HUNDRED NINETY NINE FEMALE. PARTICIPANTS ALL OF THE C. C. T. R. PEAS ARE OPERATED BY A NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE UNDER CONTRACT WITH C. C. R.. OF THE FEMALE OFFENDER PROGRAM SERVICES IS CURRENTLY DISCUSSING POSSIBLE EXPANSION WITH PROGRAMS IN LOS ANGELES AND BEAUMONT -- I DO WANT TO SAY THAT -- THAT THAT NUMBER IS GOING NUMBER OF FEMALES IN ALTERNATIVE CUSTODY PLACEMENTS. OF THE REASON THAT IT'S REALLY SO LOW IS BECAUSE THE READ THE REALITY IS IS THAT HOUSING PLANS FOR FEMALE OFFENDERS ARE QUITE DIFFERENT THAN THEY ARE FOR THE MALE OFFENDERS WHAT. SADLY WHAT WE FIND IS THAT -- MEN RETURNED TO SOMEONE STABLE ENVIRONMENTS IN THE FEMALE POPULATION OF STRUGGLING TO FIND THAT STABLE ENVIRONMENT AND WE ARE WORKING WITH PAROLE TO MAKE SURE. WE ARE -- APPROVING THE CORRECT WOMEN TO BE IN THESE ALTERNATE CUSTODY PLACE BEEN HOME SO THAT NUMBER IS ASSIGNED TO ME ALSO BUT IT ALSO CONSISTENT WITH NATIONAL DATA AS A PRT OF THE GENDER RESPONSE OF PRINCIPLES. THAT ARE PUT UP BY THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF CORRECTIONS SO WE'RE WE'RE CHECKING NATIONALLY TO MAKE SURE WE'RE DOING THE RIGHT THING. ON WE HAVE -- ALSO FIVE OVER FIVE THOUSAND INMATES IN FACE TO FACE COLLEGES AND ARE IN A THIRTY FIVE INSTITUTIONS. AND AT A MUCH MORE BASIC LEVEL WHAT WE'RE FINDING IS THAT WE HAVE TO ADDRESS THE LITERACY OF OUR INMATES TO COME IN. WHAT WE FIND IS ALMOST HALF 47% OF OUR POPULATION RES BELOW NINE POINT NO? AND ALSO WHAT WE FIND IS ABOUT ONLY 30% OF OUR POPULATION HAVE A HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA OR EQUIVALENT SEE WHEN THEY COME IN. THAT'S CONCERNING. WE NEED IN MAY BE ABLE TO ADVOCATE FOR THEMSELVES THEY NEED TO IMPROVE THEIR LITERACY -- WHICH MAKES IN ROMAN IN BASIC EDUCATION ABOUT TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND OFFENDERS. IN EDUCATION PROGRAMS AND ADULT BASIC EDUCATION HIGH SCHOOL EQUIVALENCY -- THE GOAL IS THAT TO TO REACH THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF EQUIVALENCY FOR AND LITERACY FOR INMATE POPULATION. THE DEPARTMENTS I SUBMITTED A B. C. P. TO THIS COMMITTEE FOR CONSIDERATION TO FUND. PROGRAMS SPECIFICALLY AIMED AT IMPROVING LITERACY AND WE'RE GONNA HIT ON A COUPLE OF POINTS INCLUDING DIAGNOSTIC REMEDIAL READING PROGRAMS. COMPUTER BASED LEARNING. ENGLISH AS A SECOND LANGUAGE TEACHER MENTOR AND I THINK ONE OF THE MOST ENCOURAGING I'M I'M LOOKING FOR THIS. INMATE LITERACY COACHES SPECIFICALLY AIMED AT IMPROVING LITERACY. I KNOW THAT I'VE TAKEN A LOT OF THE TIME ALLOTTED -- BUT I DO WANT TO MENTION SOMETHING CITY STARS IN THE PROCESS OF OVERHAULING. IN MANY WAYS. REINVENTING THE MANAGEMENT AND HOW WE HOUSE THE TRANSGENDER POPULATION OTHERS WORK GROUPS MEETING TODAY ON HOW WE HOUSE THEM SO WE CAN MAKE BETTER DECISIONS -- AND I BELIEVE WE'RE HEAD OF THE NATION IN MANY RESPECTS IN THIS ASPECT. NINETY NUMBER THIRTY FIVE IS INSTITUTION SEVEN pUNDER THE JURISDICTION FROM THE FEDERAL RECEIVER. I WHICH PUT US OVER 50% AND I KNOW -- MISTER KELSO SAID BEHIND ME HE'S GOING TO GIVE A FOR TO CONTINUALLY WORK YOU MISTER KELSO IN THIS EFFORT AND WE DO WORK VERY CLOSELY TOGETHER TO IMPROVE I APPRECIATE THE RELATIONSHIP. I'M ALSO WORKING ON AN ISSUE THAT'S THE ACCESS THE FAMILIES HAVE TO THEIR LOVED ONES IN STATE PRISON I'VE ASSN DIVISION ADULT INSTITUTIONS TO CONVENE STATEWIDE TRAINING ON HOW WE CAN IMPROVE. OUR VISIT IN EXPERIENCE FOR THE OVER SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND VISITS WE GET OUR PRISONS EVERY YEAR. I'VE ALSO TEST THE A. I. FOR IMPROVING OUR CUSTOMER SERVICE AT THE INSTITUTIONS SO WHEN LOVED ONES OR ANYONE CALL THEY CAN GET BETTER RESPONSES -- AND I'LL SAY THAT NO THOSE SOME OF THOSE THINGS ARE SO BASIC BUT THEY ARE SO CRITICAL THE POPULATION AND OF THE SYSTEM THE CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO READ IN AND GO OVER. WHAT WE WHAT WE HAVE AND I WELCOME ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU HAVE? WELL I IMAGINE SO MY COLLEAGUES HAVE SOME QUESTIONS BUT BEFORE I CALL ON THEM -- SO WE HAVE OBVIOUSLY A NUMBER OF THINGS ON THIS AND A INCLUDING HEARING FROM. AND SO IT. FOR EXAMPLE ALL THE QUESTIONS I MIGHT WANT TO ASK WE COULD BE HERE A LONG LONG TIME SO I'M GONNA TRY TO RUN THIS AS EFFICIENTLY AS POSSIBLE SO THAT THAT IS NOT NECESSARILY THE CASE BUT THAT WE ARE STILL. PRECEDING IN A WAY THAT ALLOWS US. TO AT GET INTO THE INFORMATION THAT WE NEED TO TO BE ABLE TO THAT THESE BUDGET REQUEST. SO IN THAT SPIRIT I WANT TO SEE IF. LA -- HAS ANYTHING SPECIFIC THAT THEY WANT. TO RAISE REGARDING ON ACTING SECRETARY DS'S -- THAT'S MONIQUE OTHERWISE OBVIOUSLY WE HAVE. LA OWES -- MULTIPLE GOOD REPORTS ON THAT -- KIND OF OVER. ARCHING AROUND THIS SUCH AS THE PROP FIFTY SEVEN RAG SO RATHER THAN REPEATING THEM HERE IF THERE'S ANYTHING SPECIFIC THAT'S NOT IN ONE OF THE REPORTS THAT WE HAVE ACCESS. TO PLEASE BRING IT TO OUR ATTENTION. HE WON O'NEILL WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. OUR COMMENTS ARE ALREADY REFLECTED IN THE REPORT THAT YOU HAVE SO I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING ELSE RELATED TO THE POPULATION. OF BUDGET REQUEST OTHER THAN THAT WHAT IS IN THE REPORT. APPRECIATE IT AND OBVIOUSLY. ON GIVEN THAT WAS. POINTED OUT BY THE SECRETARY DE IS THAT WE STILL HAVE NOT WE STILL HAVE INMATES IN ARIZONA. AND WE WERE EXPECTING THAT WE WOULD NOT HAVE IN MASON ARIZONA BY THIS FISCAL YEAR. ON AND THAT WE ARE STILL HOVERING RIGHT AROUND OUR AND COURT MANDATED POPULATION NUMBER. THE AS WE MOVE FORWARD IN THIS SEPT COMMITTEE PROCESS IF LA -- HAS SPECIFIC ACTIONS THE FUEL. THAT -- WE SHOULD BE TAKING. TO TO ADDRESS THAT POPULATION REDUCTION. ON WE WOULD APPRECIATE IT I KNOW THERE IS MUCH IN THE REPORT TO PRESENTED TO US ALREADY FOR EXAMPLE AROUND FIFTY SEVEN BUT IF THERE ARE. AS WE PROCEED YOU KNOW ANYTHING YOU EALLY REALLY WANT TO HAVE US -- YOU FEELS WORTHWHILE FOR US TO HONE IN ON THAT WOULD BE APPRECIATED. ON ALL RIGHT SO. I I WOULD ASK A FEW QUESTIONS AND THEN I HAVE TO CALL ON MY COLLEAGUES. ON ONE ONE QUESTION I HAVE IS AROUND ALTERNATIVE CUSTODY. AND THAT IS ONE MECHANISM FOR US TO BRING POPULATION DOWN. AND GIVEN THAT OUR WOMEN'S FACILITY IS ONE OF THE MOST SERIOUSLY OVERCROWDED IT'S AT A HUNDRED AND 40% IT'S POPULATION TO HEAR THAT WE ARE ONLY IN SIXTEEN WOMEN AN ALTERNATIVE CASSIE. I'M NOT PLEASED. AND TO HAVE THE CORRELATION BE WILL THAT. THIS POPULATIONS HARDER TO HOUSING THAT'S THAT'S A REINFORCED BY NATIONAL STUDY. I HAD DOESN'T HELP ME. SO -- WE HAVE PUT. WE HAVE. DIRECTED THIS AS A PRIORITY IN AN EMPHASIS [inaudible] TO PURSUE -- MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR ALTERNATIVE CUSTODY [inaudible] AND THE ANY OTHER COMMENTS YOU WANNA MAKE ABOUT THAT I'M I'M JUST AS CONCERNED AS YOU SENATOR I AM -- TO LOOK AT THE NUMBERS COMPARED TO WHAT WE HAVE IN THE MEN'S MAIL COMMUNITY REENTRY PROGRAMS. SIXTEEN IS IS NOT A GOOD NUMBER -- AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I I WANT TO DO IS WORK WITH YOU I LOOK FORWARD. TO WORKING WITH YOU BUT ALSO HAVING A OUR PROCESS IF IT'S TOO STRINGENT IF THE THINGS THAT WE NEED TO RECOGNIZE THAT THERE ARE pAND FEMALES. AND WE NEED TO WORK WITH WORK WITH OUR PAROLE AND OUR AND OUR COUNTY PARTNERS EVEN IF. WE CAN DO THAT BUT I KNOW WE CAN BUT IT'S JUST IS CONCERNED I LOOK FOR TO WORKING WITH YOU ON IT MY TEAM. AS I WAS DEVELOPING MY TALKING POINTS THIS WAS ONE AREA THAT THEY ARE BACK DOING WORK ON BECAUSE THAT WAS TRULY A NUMBER THAT I'M NOT. I'M IN AND I RAISE THE ISSUE OF THE FACT THAT WE HAVE NOT YET BEEN ABLE TO MOVE ARE FOLKS WHO ARE OUT OF STATE. THAT GIVEN THAT WE HAVE EMPHASIZED REHABILITATION EVEN BEFORE THE PASSAGE OF PROP. FIFTY SEVEN AND WHILE WE EXPECT IN OUR CONTRACTS THAT WE HAVE THAT TYPE OF REQUIREMENT -- EXPECTATION IN ARIZONA WE HAVE NO ABILITY TO REALLY MONNING WE HAVE NO REAL ABILITY TO KNOW THAT THEY ARE MEETING. THE ARE. THE OBJECTIVES WE HAVE WHICH IS I THINK ANOTHER REASON WHY. ON THERE IS GREAT DESIRE IN ADDITION MEETING OUR COURT MANDATED POPULATION CAP TO GET THOSE FOLKS OUT FROM OUT OF STATE. WHERE WE HAVE MORE ABILITY TO PROVIDE THE PROPER OVERSIGHT? I'M SO IN THAT SPIRIT I WANT TO ALSO ASK THE QUESTION OF OUR WITHIN. WITHIN OUR OWN REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMS AND WORK -- COMMITTEE MEMBERS IN TWO WEEKS WE'RE GOING TO HAVE. AN AGENDA VARIES VERY -- FOCUSED ON THAT GIVEN ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE AUDITOR'S REPORT AND OTHER THINGS -- TO TO REALLY LOOK AT WHETHER ARE YES WHETHER OUR PROGRAMS ARE. ARE ADEQUATE WHETHER THEY ARE -- ACCESSIBLE TO ALL THE INMATES THAT NEED THEM SO I WANT TO GO INTO GREAT DETAIL ABOUT THAT TODAY BUT I DO WANT TO ASK. THAT WHEN YOU DESCRIBE THAT WE HAVE -- OUR POPULATION IS GOING TO BE 1% HIGHER THAN WE WERE HOPING. THEN I THINK TO MYSELF WELL IF IT'S HIGHER THAN WE WERE PROJECTING. AND WE STILL HAVE YARDS THAT DO NOT HAVE. PROGRAMS THAT WOULD ALLOW INMATES TO BE ABLE. TO GET REHABILITATIVE CREDITS AND WHILE I COMPLETELY APPRECIATE. THAT WE SHOULD NOT EXCLUDE LIFERS FROM PROGRAMS WE SHOULD NOT. BUT KNOWING THAT WE HAVE THIS EMPHASIS IN KNOWING THAT WE HAVE GIVEN INMATES THE PROMISE OF BEING ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN THESE PROGRAMS. AND AND YET YOU INDICATE THAT OUR POPULATIONS HIGHER. AND I THINK PART OF IT IS DUE TO THE FACT THAT WE DON'T HAVE THESE PROGRAMS SUCCESSFUL TO INMATES IN WITH THEY'RE NOT AVAILABLE IN ALL YARDS. WHAT ARE YOU DOING ABOUT IT? WHILE WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE DIVISION OF REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMS AND I AT I THINK ON THE CHEN. NO NOT TODAY INTO WHAT WORKING CLOSELY WITH THEM AND ONE OF THE WHAT WE ARE WORKING ON IS ENSURING THAT -- V. SPACE THAT WE HAVE IN THE INSTITUTION IS BEING MAXIMIZE THAT WE ARE LOOKING BEYOND OUR TRADITIONAL CUSTODIAL MINDSETS ON WHAT WE CAN PUT INMATES IN PROGRAMS -- BECAUSE A BOILS DOWN MEANT MAJORITY THE TIME SENATOR IS. TIME AND SPACE THIS LIMITED AMOUNT OF TIME IN A DAY TO WHERE WE CAN HAVE INMATES AND PROGRAM AND I AM PUSHING. A CUSTODIAL REQUIREMENTS SO WE CAN SOME SECURITY CONCERNS CANNOT PROGRAM IN THE EVENINGS ARE AT NIGHT -- LOOKING OVER SO -- ESCAPE CONCERNED SOMETIMES THAT WE THINK AND WHAT AT AND REALLY PUSHING THEM TO THINK OUTSIDE THE TRADITIONAL CUSTODIAL MINDSET. BECAUSE A LOT OF THE REGULATIONS THAT WE HAVE FOR SECURITY PURPOSES WERE WRITTEN WHAT WE FIND A WRITTEN IN THE EIGHTIES DURING A MORE CONSERVATIVE TIME. AND IT'S A DIFFERENT DAY IN CORRECTIONS NOW WE'RE PUSHING THEM TO RECOGNIZE THAT THE THAT THE WARDENS MUST BE VERY CREATIVE ON WHERE WE ARE PUTTING CLASSES IN. WHAT WE ARE ALLOWING THESE IN MAY -- OR THE REHABILITATIVE ACHIEVEMENT CREDITS -- TO TO OCCUR. BUT ALSO -- WORKING WITH THE COMMUNITIES TO BRING THE VOLUNTEERS IN. AND TO AND TO ALSO SOLICIT -- ON THE INTEGRATED INNOVATIVE GRANT SIDE INFORMATION THAT -- WHAT PROGRAMS WORK BEST AND TO GET THEM IN THESE INSTITUTIONS BUT A LOT OF IT BOILS DOWN TO SOMETIMES IS TIME AND SPACE -- BUT WE ARE REALLY EMPHASIZING WITH THE WAR THERE'S A SOCIAL DIRECTORS TEAMS AND THE DIRECTOR. TO REPORT. ON A MONTHLY BASIS THAT THEY'RE MAXIMIZING THE OPPORTUNITIES. BUT WHAT DUMB. THEY KNOW IN THE END WHAT WE FIND IS OUR RURAL INSTITUTIONS. THE VOLUNTEER BASE -- EVEN SOMETIMES THE THE EMPLOYMENT BASE PEOPLE NOW WANT TO MOVE TO THESE AREAS TO GET HIRED FOR THESE JOBS BUT WE'VE ALSO DONE. IS RECOGNIZE THAT WE HAVE A SEGMENT OF THE POPULATION THAT DO WANT TO COME BACK AND THAT'S THE FORMALLY INCARCERATED THEY WANT TO COME BACK AND CONTRIBUTE -- WITHIN THE PRISONS WE RCOGNIZE THAT THERE ARE THE MOST CREDIBLE MESSENGERS AND IF THEY ARE EAGER THEY WANT TO COME IN AND HELP. IN THIS EFFORT TO REHABILITATE AND PROVIDE SERVICES TO THE POPULATION. THE THE MOST TROUBLE MESSENGER BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO RECOGNIZE -- AND BALANCE WE'RE DOING THIS TO MAKE SURE INMATES OR CV AND REHABILITATIVE SERVICES AND NOT SO MUCH JUST FOR THE FOCUS OF WE NEED TO GET HIM OUT OF PRISON FASTER. I NEED TO MEET BOTH OF THEM MEET THE PUBLIC SAFETY COMPONENT AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE PROGRAMS ARE. ONES THAT ACTUALLY PREPARE THEM FOR THE PROPER REINVENT SO THAT IT'S A KEEPING ALSO THE RECIDIVISM RATE FOR A LOWERING. CHRIS CHRISTIE WELL I THINK ALL ALL SOMEONE UP THERE THAT IT'S IT'S REALLY WITH OVERSIGHT THAT. AND GIVING -- GIVING INSTITUTIONS PERMISSION SIDE OF WHAT THE TRADITIONAL MINDSETS ARE BUT THAT IS ALSO GOING TO BE THE CONSISTENT OVERSIGHT WITH THE DIVISION OF REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMS. AND THE DIVISION OF ADULT INSTITUTIONS THROUGH BOTH DIRECTORS BECAUSE WHAT I'VE GIVEN THEM THE DIRECTIVE OF THIS YOU NEED TO BE CREATIVE. DON'T BRING ME -- YOU KNOW WE HAVE TRADITIONALLY NOT USE THIS SPACE BECAUSE IS DEDICATED FOR X. WELL THAT'S IT'S DEDICATED FOR EVERYBODY. AND IT'S FOR EVERYBODY'S USE OF ITS OPEN YOU USE IT AND IF YOU'RE HAVING TROUBLE GETTING VOLUNTEERS PLEASE LET US KNOW WE HAVE OTHER WAYS OF REACHING COMMUNITIES. NOW SOLICIT ANY ASSISTANCE FROM THIS FOR FROM -- FROM THE COMMITTEE HERE AND HOW WE CAN REACH THAT VOLUNTEER BASE AND MAYBE. THE SPELL THE CONCERN OF WHAT VOLUNTEERING IN PRISON IS. IF YOU GO TO SAINT QUITTING RIGHT UP YOU KNOW JUST UP THE ROAD HERE IT IS VERY OPEN WE HAVE THOUSANDS OF VOLUNTEERS THAT COME IN THE ANNUAL BASIS. WHEN YOU GO TO OTHERS YOU MAY HAVE HUNDREDS? AND MAYBE JUST BECAUSE OF THE THE LOCATION OF WHERE IT IS IN THE STATE THE FOUGHT MAYBE WE NEED TO REACH OUT MORE TO CIVIC GROUPS CHURCHES. COLLEGES AND NOT JUST RELYING THE TRADITIONAL LET'S JUST REACHED A CONTACT NARCOTICS ANONYMOUS ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS AND HAVE THEM COME IN. BECAUSE IT WONDERFUL PROGRAMS LIKE GOING OUT BY GOING IN -- SHAKESPEARE THE ACTORS GANG FULL IN BRINGING THOSE GROUPS OF SOME OF THESE RURAL PLACES -- BUT IT'S REALLY JUST A COLLECTIVE EFFORT. SAID TO GET PEOPLE IN TO PROVIDE THE SERVICES. AND THEN I HAVE A QUESTION ON THE ISSUE. WHICH IS ARE SOLITARY HOUSING. UNITS. AND WE IN ADDITION -- TO BUDGETARY LEGISLATIVE. I THINK WAS IN BUDGET ARM ACTION THAT BASICALLY DIRECTED REDUCTIONS IN OUR USE OF THE ISSUE. I'M WE'VE ALSO HAVE COURT ORDER. RELATED TO SHOOT. AND WE JUST RECENTLY SEEN THAT THE JUDGE INTERVENED AGAIN INDICATING THAT WE HAVE NOT YET. THAT WE ARE STILL -- INAPPROPRIATELY. BY UTILIZING ISSUE IN THIS YOU FOR LONGER PERIODS OF TIME POTENTIALLY THAN IS NECESSARY SO WE'VE WE'VE HAD. THE ANOTHER INTERVENTION AND I GUESS WHAT I'D LIKE TO KNOW IS THAT YES IT'S SEVEN HUNDRED OR EIGHT HUNDRED IS BETTER IN. FOUR THOUSAND BUT WHY ARE WE NOT -- DOWN TO NEAR. ZERO WELL I I I WANT TO MAKE SURE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE SAME THING AND I THINK I'M FAMILIAR WITH WITH THE THE THE THE LEGAL DECISION THAT YOU THAT YOU READ AND THAT'S THE ASKER CASE [inaudible] AND I AM. I WANT TO MAKE SURE I'M UNDERSTANDING THE THE LAST THE LEGAL BRIEF IN THAT I RECEIVED AND I AM FAMILIAR WITH THE CHALLENGES THAT ARE OUT THERE IT IS REALLY BEEN TE DISCUSSION HAS BEEN. NOT SO MUCH THE UTILIZATION OF SHOE PUTTING INMATES IN SHOE. BUT THE IMAGE THAT ARE RELEASED. ON TO OUR LEVEL FOR FACILITIES AND THAT -- THOUGHT IS WE'RE PUTTING THEM ON THOSE FACILITIES -- AND AT A HIGHER RATE AND WE'RE NOT AFFORDING THEM -- THE A METHOD SAME AMOUNT OF PROGRAM IS THE REST OF THE INSTITUTIONS. AND THAT -- WE ARE THE INMATES THAT WERE INVOLVED IN THE LAWSUIT -- THAT GOT US TO WHERE WE ARE -- WE DON'T ALWAYS AGREE WITH THEM -- BUT I DO BELIEVE WE'RE STILL TRAINING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION IN THE UTILIZATION OF SHOE WE DO HAVE CHALLENGES. AND WHAT WE DO WITH THE POPULATION THAT WERE RELEASED. THAT THEY WARRANT YOU ONE YEAR ANOTHER HERE THE BELIEF IS THAT WE WE NEED TO BE PUSHING HIM TO THE LOWEST LEVELS OF POSSIBLE GET ENOUGH MORE REHABILITATION. AND I AGREE BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO BALANCE THE SECURITY NEEDS OF PUTTING AN INDIVIDUAL AT LOWER LEVELS FOR WITH A GROUP OF INMATES THAT. HAVE ALREADY MADE GOOD DECISIONS TO WANT TO FOREGO THAT LIFESTYLE. AND NOT -- JUST WANTONLY PUTTING SOME OF THESE RECENT SURE RELEASES ON THOSE YARDS THE FEAR IS. THAT IT COULD UPSET THE CHEMISTRY ON THOSE YOU BEGIN IN A MORE CUSTODIAL YOU KNOW BOOGEYMAN TYPE SITUATION WE ARE. APPROACHING. A US A PLACE IN CORRECTIONS WERE ARE CLASSIFICATION STAFFER PRISONS UNDERSTAND. THAT BEHAVIOR OVERRIDES A TO LOWER LEVEL FACILITIES REGARDLESS OF THE POINTS THAT THEY THAT THEY HAVE. THESE WE NEED -- TO RECOGNIZE THAT THE INMATE MAY NOT HAVE RECEIVED. DISCIPLINARY HEARINGS FOR FIVE YEARS BUT HE WILL NEVER EARN HIS WAY DOWN BECAUSE OF THE HIGH LEVEL OF POINTS BECAUSE HE EARNED THEM EARLY ON IN HIS PRISON TERM. SO WE TAKE THEM AND SAY WE RECOGNIZE YOU HAVEN'T BEHAVE THIS WAY FOR QUITE SOME TIME. YOU EARN THOSE HIGH LEVEL POINTS EARLY ON IN YOUR CAREER BUT YOU'VE DEMONSTRATED YOU DO WANT TO PARTICIPATE. SO WE HAVE THOUSANDS AND I CAN GET YOU THAT EXACT NUMBER AT ANOTHER TIME WE HAVE THOUSANDS OF INMATES WE HAVE DISCIPLINE EVERY OVER WRITTEN AND RECOGNIZING. THE PAST BEHAVIOR DOESN'T DICTATE TO THEY ARE NOW -- I WISH WE WERE OUT OF THE OSCAR LAWSUIT I FELT THAT WE HAVE SATISFIED THE INITIAL CONCERNS OF THE LAWSUIT AND ADDRESS ISSUE. BUT CLEARLY WE WE WE STILL HAVE MORE CHALLENGES -- TO ADDRESS THE CONCERNS THAT KEEP IN BROUGHT UP THANK YOU I'M SURE WILL RETURN TO THAT DISCUSSION AT SOME POINT. FOR TO IT -- CALLING. YES SENATOR STONE WE WERE LIKE SKIS ME GO AHEAD [inaudible] I'M SURE. THANK YOU MISTER DE IS. THIS IS MY FIRST [inaudible] MEETING. FOR SOME FIVE ARE USE NERVOUS AS I AM. MAYBE. SO I I JUST HAVE SOME REALLY BASIC QUESTIONS. THE FIRST IS. YOU REALLY REYES PROP. FIFTY SEVEN AND WE'RE SORT OF ON THE OTHER SIDE OF IT AND WE'RE SEEING. OTHER ISSUES IN OUR COMMUNITIES WITH PERSONAL RAIMES. SHOPLIFTING ALL THESE OTHER THINGS SO. IF YOU GIVEN SOME [inaudible] REALLY POSITIVE. FACTORS AT YOUR BENEFITING FROM IN SEOUL. HELP ME OUT A LITTLE MORE -- OBVIOUSLY THERE'S TWO COMPONENTS TO PROP FIFTY SEVEN AND YOU'RE SORT OF EDUCATING ME ON YOUR SIDE. I IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE YOU WANT TO ADD TO TO TO YOUR REMARKS. SO ALL PUT ON MY TRANSITION HAD WHEN WE TRANSITION THE INMATE FROM PRISON BACK TO THE COMMUNITIES. AND FOR ME ON ON THAT ASPECT IT IT'S IT'S CRITICAL. THAT WE ARE COMMUNICATING WITH OUR CITY AND COUNTY PARTNERS. ON HOW WE PROPERLY TRANSITION AN INDIVIDUAL FROM INCARCERATION TO THE COMMUNITY AND THE WAYS THAT WE DO THAT IS WE WORK WITH OUR COUNTY PARTNERS. TO COMMUNICATE WITH THEM IF THE INDIVIDUAL IS GOING OFF TO COMMUNITY SUPERVISION ON THE PROBATION SIDE. AND WHAT I DO AT SECRETARY I MEET QUITE OFTEN COMMUNICATE QUITE OFTEN WITH THE CALIFORNIA PROBATION OFFICERS CHIEFS A GROUP SEE PARK -- AND WE WORK TOGETHER ON WHAT WE MAY BE -- FAILING ON ON OUR END OF WHAT THEY NEED SO THEY CAN BETTER TRANSITION ON THE PREVENTION SIDE. WE ARM AND ONE OF THOSE THINGS IS TO ENSURE THAT -- MENTALLY ILL INMATE WE'RE HAVING A PROPER TRANSITION WITH THEM -- AND EVEN THE MEDICAL INMATES BUT THEN NOT ONLY THE MENTAL HEALTH IN THE MEDICAL BUT ALSO ON THE JOB SIDE. TO MAKE SURE WE ARE COMMUNICATING WITH OUR CITY AND COUNTY PARTNERS AND AND A PRO PARTNERS THAT THE INDIVIDUAL THAT BEEN RELEASED HAS THESE CERTIFICATIONS WHETHER IT BE. WELDING CARPENTRY PLUMBING THEY'VE BEEN CERTIFIED IN THESE VARIOUS PROGRAMS IN THESE ARE NATIONALLY CERTIFIED RECOGNIZED TO BECAUSE THEY RECEIVE. I WANT TO MAKE SURE THE BEING UTILIZED IN ONE OF THOSE EFFORTS IS A PRISON TO EMPLOYMENT EFFORTS THAT WE ARE DOING RIGHT NOW. AND WHAT THAT DOES FOR US IS WITH -- WITH WORK WITHIN CDC ARE WITH OUR LABOR PARTNERS -- WITH THE THE LOCAL UNIONS -- WE ARE MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE MAKING THOSE CONNECTIONS AND WHAT WE HAVE DONE IS WE'VE HAD -- STATE AGENCIES COME IN AND GIVE STATE EXAMINATIONS FOR INMATES WILL QUALIFY FOR CERTAIN JOBS. SO WE'RE TRYING TO GET THEM EMPLOYED AND WE'VE BEEN SUCCESSFUL WITH THAT WE'VE HAD -- IN MAKES MORE -- RECEIVED THOSE -- EXAMINATIONS HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN JOB OFFERS. SO WE RECOGNIZE THAT A SUCCESSFUL TRANSITION IS TO MAKE SURE THE NEEDS ARE MET. HOUSING MEDICAL EMPLOYMENT -- SO THAT SERVES ME THAT'S ENCOURAGING BUT ALSO. THE PARTNERSHIP WITH CDC OTHER WE HAVE WITH -- THE CALIFORNIA CHIEFS ASSOCIATION FEES POLICE ASSOCIATION WHICH I JUST SPOKE OUT YESTERDAY IN SANTA CLARA. I GIVE A PRESENTATION SIMILAR TO THIS BUT THEN I ALSO FILLED CONCERNS OR QUESTIONS THAT THEY MAY BE HAVING AND THEY ARE SIMILAR TO WHAT YOU BY SENATOR. APOLOGIES BUT I JUST WANTED TO STAY FOCUSED AND THE QUESTION WAS ABOUT. FIFTY SEVEN AND THE CORE LE IN. AN INCREASE IN SUCH CRIMES. AND SO I WOULD. IF I TYPE ALL THOSE OF MY RECORD I COULD TO I GUESS FOR A VERY ENTERTAINING STOP BOTHERING THE WELL I JUST I WOULD JUST SUCH AND I'M TRYING TO MAKE YEAH BECAUSE OTHERWISE I'M GONNA ASK A VERY SIMILAR QUESTION AND TRY TO GET THE ACTUAL. BUT ANYWAY YOU PROCEED -- I WAS A SUPERVISOR FOR EIGHT YEARS FOR THE COUNTY OF ORANGE AND AND MOST OF THAT TIME I WAS CHAIR OF THE ORANGE COUNTY CRIMINAL JUSTICE CORDONING COMMITTEES I HAD THE JOY OF WORKING WITH. THE CHEAPER PROBATION AND THE SHERIFF AND THE DA AND WE WOULD MEET ONCE A MONTH AND SO THERE IS A LOT TO LEARN -- THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PAROLE AND PROBATION AND I'LL BE SPEAKING TO SEE PARK MYSELF THIS MONTH AND STEVE SEGMENT IS MIKE CHIEF AND WORK TOGETHER FOR YEARS LIKE. I HAVE BUT I HAVE A A NEW LEARNING CURVE NOW -- ON THIS SIDE IF YOU LIKE I I I WOULD WELCOME AN INVITATION I COULD BRIEF YOU ON A MORE GRANULAR LEVEL OF THE GRAPHIC THAT BE GREAT JOB MY STAFF REACH OUT TO YOUR STAFF WE CAN SET UP pTHE BRAIN AND SO THE ONLY OTHER QUESTION I WOULD HAVE. MEANT I'M SURE IS A AND IT'S IT'S LATER IN THE REPORT BUT AT CDC ARE WANTS TO ADD A LOT OF FIGURE OUT WHY. A WIN. HAVING BEEN A DEPARTMENT HEAD. AS WELL I I DON'T SEE. WORKLOAD INCREASING ENOUGH TO WARRANT EVEN A FULL TIME. EQUIVALENT POSITION SO -- I DON'T KNOW IF WE'LL WIN WE WOULD ASK ON ON ISSUE TO IS THIS THE TIME MORE I'M ISSUE TO WILL GET THEM. INTO ADDITION TO BUT I THINK IT'S PERFECTLY LEGITIMATE GIVEN THAT THE SECRETARIES GIVEN US THE OVERVIEW. I THINK IT'S A PERFECTLY LEGITIMATE QUESTION JUST JUST AROUND THIS YEAH WHY ARE WE INCREASING F. T. E. AT A POINT WHERE. WE ARE REDUCING POPULATION INSIDE AND SEE THE TRAINING WHEELS. NO NO NO NO NO THESE ARE THESE ARE GREAT QUESTIONS. AND I WANNA MAKE SURE YOU YOU RECEIVE THE INFORMATION LOOKING FOR AND SOLD. WELL I HAVE A IT SAYS FOR SENATE BILL TWO THREE TWO SEVEN BY QUIRK YOU NEED YOU'RE REQUESTING ADDITIONAL RESOURCES. WAS I MEAN. WE'RE REQUESTING FOR AT THE NEXT ISSUE WE GET TO IT IS A SERIES OF BILLS THAT PASSED THROUGH -- LEGISLATION THAT DIDN'T HAVE AN APPROPRIATIONS WE HAVE A BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL. TO ADD THE STAFF -- THAT WE NEED -- TO TO ENACT THOSE BILLS I WOULD STATE TALKING ABOUT POSITIONS JUST ON A ON A ON A BIGGER SCALE. OUR POSITIONS THA WE HAVE WE ARE ACTUALLY GOING DOWN IN THE GENERAL SECURITY CATEGORY. THE AS THE POPULATION GOES DOWN THE POSITION WITHOUT OTHER FACTORS WELL. A LOT OF THE POSITION GROWTH WERE EXPERIENCING. ARE IN THE CATEGORIES OF PAROLE WHERE WE'RE SEEING SORT OF THE OPPOSITE. OUR POPULATION IS GOING UP ALSO IN REHABILITATION PROGRAMS WE RAMP UP THOSE PROGRAMS TO TRY TO MEET THE NEEDS OF ALL THE INMATES ARE SEEKINGCREDITS. AND THEN OF COURSE -- ARE WE DOING A LOT OF WORK TO TRY TO IMPLEMENT PROP SEVEN THROUGH OUR FOR BOARD OF PAROLE HEARINGS HAVING POSITION GROWTH THERE. I THINK THE FOURTH CATEGORY WOULD BE -- ON THE MEDICAL SIDE WE HAVE IS THE RECEIVE ROLE. I SPEAK A LITTLE BIT ABOVE AS OUR POPULATION GETS MORE FRAIL. ELDERLY WE HAVE AN AGING POPULATION ARE MEDICAL NEEDS HAVE BEEN GROWING. BUT WE HAVE YOU KNOW OVERALL I THINK THE THE POSITIVE THING -- LESS OF A NEED. TRADITIONAL CDC ARE GENERAL SECURITY POSITION. FIVE THEN I'LL ASK ONE LAST QUESTION AND IT'S ON PAGE. NINE HUNDRED NUMBER FOUR AND IT'S IT'S JUST A LITTLE PARAGRAPH AT THE END. AGE NINE OF OUR AT LEAST THE REPORT I'VE BEEN IT SAYS UNDER NUMBER FOR SENATE BILL. FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE IT'S AS THE OFFICE OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS AND OFFICE OF LEGAL AFFAIRS WEST. TWENTY SIX AND FOUR POINT BY POSITIONS [inaudible] RESPECTIVELY. TOTAL OF THIRTY POINT FIVE POSITIONS TO IMPLEMENT THE DUTIES ASSOCIATED. WITH A. B. FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE AND I I FOR THE LIFE OF ME I DON'T SEE ANY ADDITIONAL DUTIES. FOR KEEPING PERSONNEL FILES SITE. THERE'S A SO SO I'M I'M JUST WE WE HAVE. WE LET'S GET INTO THAT IN IF YOU DON'T MIND YOU CAN GIVE US AN OVERVIEW BECAUSE WHEN WE MIGHT. WHAT MIGHT NOT? TO A LEGITIMATE QUESTION MIGHT BE AND WHY AREN'T WE RE PURPOSING STAFF. VERSES NEW BUT WE'RE GONNA GET INTO MUCH DETAIL AROUND THESE PARTICULAR THINGS IN THAT ITEM TO BUT CERTAINLY. I CAN GIVE OVER VERSUS YOU YEAH FIRST OF ALL I'VE. I'VE ALREADY RECEIVED SOME SOME OF THE COMMUNICATIONS AND CONCERNS ON THAT AND I THINK Gí WITH CORRECTIONS WE TRAIN HIT A HOME RUN WE WANT TO JUST OVER CHIEF AND WE THEN HAVE CONCERN WITH THE RETROACTIVITY OF IT SO I THINK IN A REQUEST THAT. WE SEE HERE WE JUST WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE ARE FULFILLING. THE THE INTENT AND NEED AND SPIRIT OF FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE BUT THE TEAM WE'VE WE'VE BRIEFED AND YOU KNOW THE YOU CAN GET A MORE GRANULAR DISCUSSION WITH THEM. BUT I THINK IT COMES FROM NOT SO MUCH WE'RE TRYING TO EMPIRE BUILD. IT WAS TRYING TO MAKE SURE WE IMPLEMENT IT CORRECTLY A BECAUSE WE DO WANT TO BE THAT TRANSPARENCY WE DO WHAT WE ARE SO LARGE. AND WE HAVE SO MUCH OVERSIGHT AND RIGHTLY SO THE LARGE BUDGET WE HAVE A HUGE MISSION. AND WE DESERVE THAT OVERSIGHT SO I THINK -- WHEN THE TEAM PRESENTS HERE BUT I THINK II HOPE THIS THE? NO THAT THE TASTE OF WHAT YOU READ WASN'T -- GRAY HERE GOES CORRECTIONS AGAIN IT WAS CAME FROM A SPIRIT OF TRYING TO OVER ACHIEVE IN TRYING TO DO IT RIGHT. THOUGH MAYBE I SHOULD HAVE SAID LIMITED TERM POSITION MAKE MAYBE I MEAN WE TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT'S EACH BE DEAD WITHIN THAT. SO WE ARE EXAMINING THAT AND THEN I'M SURE THE TEAM WILL IT TAKE YOU AND MORE. THANK YOU MISTER DAVIS THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. EARLY SENATOR MORE LIKE AN NO WORRIES IT'S PERFECTLY LEGITIMATE ESPECIALLY IN THE OVERVIEW TO ASK THINGS LIKE WHY IS THEIR POSITION GROWTH. WHY IS THERE NOT RE PURPOSING OF BECAUSE THINGS WHICH THEN WHEN WE GET INTO THE PARTICULAR ITEM WE CAN EVEN GET MORE GRANULAR? BUT I JUST WANT ONE MAKE ONE NO BEFORE I TURN TO SENATOR BELT. AROUND PROP SEVEN SINCE YOU ASKED A SPECIFIC QUESTION. AND CERTAINLY VERY IMPORTANT FOR US TO MONITOR BUT I THINK WHAT WE WHEN WE LOOK AT THE THE DATA AND IT'S IT'S NOT -- ACROSS THE BOARD YET IN TERMS OF THESE PROPERTY CRIMES AND SUCH BUT THERE ARE DIFFERENT PLACES IN THE STATE WHERE IT HAS INCREASED. WHAT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE? IS THAT PROP FIFTY SEVEN RAKES ONLY WENT INTO EFFECT. LITTLE MORE THAN A YEAR AGO SO THEY WERE ONLY WRAP IT IN IT IN THE END OF NOVEMBER SEVENTEENTH SO IN EFFECT WE'VE HAD A LITTLE MORE THAN A YEAR OF THEIR AND WHAT. THE CREDIT ALLOW THE IN MAY TO DO IS GIVES THEM A LITTLE -- TIME BEFORE THEY GO TO PROBE IT DOESN'T GUARANTEE. THEIR RELEASE IT ISN'T LIKE. AIDES SAY OUR SENTENCING CHANGES THAT MIGHT THEN SAY OKAY YOU WERE SPENT FOR THIS ORIGINALLY. BUT ACTUALLY UNDER THIS NEW LAW YOU SHOULD HAVE ONLY BEEN CENTS FOR THAT SO YOU'RE ELIGIBLE NOW FOR RELEASE. THE PROP FIFTY SEVEN ONLY GIVES YOU SO NOW I HAVE A FOUR MUCH QUICKER TO GO BEFORE PAROLE AND I KNOW THAT. AS OBVIOUSLY IF SINCE IT'S ONLY BEEN IN EFFECT FOR LITTLE MORE THAN A YEAR YOU WOULDN'T HAVE THAT MANY PEOPLE YET. HAVING GONE BEFORE PAROLE SO YOU WORTH IT FOR US TO GET THE DATA ON HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE YOU BEEN. UNDER FIFTY SEVEN BEEN ADVANCED. THE OTHER THING TO KNOW IN EARLY LATER IS THAT WE ONLY HAVE AN OF IF YOU GO BEFORE PAROLE YOU'RE BEING RELEASED. SO EVERYONE GOES BEFORE A PAROLE IT'S ONLY 18% THAT SO MY OWN. SUSPICION WE HAVE TO GET DATA IS THAT. WE'VE NOT HAD VERY MANY PEOPLE RELEASED AS A RESULT OF PROPERTY. SO IF WE ARE LOOKING AT OF REPEAT OFFENDERS IT MAY BE MORE FROM THE COUNTY JAIL LEVEL THOUGH I DON'T EVEN KNOW YET WHETHER OR ANY TYPE OF PROPERTY CRIME. HAS BEEN REPEAT OFFENDERS OR WHETHER IT'S NEW OFFENDERS SO I JUST MAKE THOSE POINTS BECAUSE IT'S CONVENIENT SOMETIMES A LINK THESE THINGS. BUT WE DON'T YET DATA THE GIVES US ANY REAL ABILITY TO LIKE THOSE THINGS. AND M. JUST TO ADD JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE -- I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO HOPE TO MEET SOME OF THE SOME OF THE QUESTIONS WITH THE AMENDED RAGS. TO EXPAND SOME SOME ASPECTS OF FOR THE SEVEN RIGHT SENATOR ABOUT [inaudible] SO. FIRST OF ALL THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE AND STEPPING FORWARD TO BE OUR DIRECTOR AND I APPRECIATE THAT VERY MUCH PERSONAL IN THANK YOU. YOU KNOW I KNOW I KNOW THAT -- IT'S SO. WONDERFUL TO HAVE YOU. ABLE TO DO THAT AS ONLY WITH SO MUCH EXPERIENCE. IN A DEPARTMENT STORE WE SHOULD DOLLAR JUST TO REALLY DO I WANT TO SAY THAT FIRST. I I IN TERMS OF YOUR DEPARTMENT -- THEY'RE JUST OF MANAGED CARE THE OLD VOTERS APPROVED PROPOSITION -- THIRTY SIX THEY PROVED -- THAT WAS IN -- TWENTY TWELVE TWENTY FOURTEEN WE HAD THE COURT ORDER THE OF NEGOTIATED AGREEMENT WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR. OF TOOK PLACE WE HAD THAT. AGREEMENT THAT WE PROMISED THAT WE WOULD DO. CERTAIN THINGS OF THAT WE WERE DOING THAT WE HAD PROP. FORTY SEVEN THE VOTERS APPROVE THAT AND TWENTY FOURTEEN THERE WAS -- SOME HOPE THERE TO A FROM FORTY SEVEN WOULD LEAD TO SAVINGS. OF SAVINGS THAT WOULD BE USED -- FOR SERVICES IN THE COMMUNITY. OF THAT WAS THE PURPOSE OF PROP. FORTY SEVEN THEY WERE PROPOSING THAT [inaudible] TRANSFERRING -- MONEY TO THE SAFE NEIGHBORHOODS -- AND SCHOOLS. OKAY SO -- DEALING WITH MAYBE THERE'S SOME OF THE SUBJECTS THAT YOU HAVE. CONCERNS ABOUT -- SORT OF THE TRUANCY THERE THEY WERE TALKING OF PROPERTIES OR SEVEN TALKED ABOUT. TRUANCY THE YOUNG PEOPLE. HELPING THE YOUNG PEOPLE THERE WITH CRIME THOSE KINDS OF PROGRAMS. OF I KNOW THEY'RE VERY SUCCESSFUL ON SAN JOSE. OF AS A PROGRAMS OF THOSE PROGRAMS ARE GOOD. FROM FORTY SEVEN WAS ALL ABOUT THAT YOU HAD NOVEMBER -- SIXTEEN TWENTY SIXTEEN PROP -- FIFTY SEVEN THE VOTERS APPROVED OUT SO IT'S BEEN BASICALLY THE COURT ORDER THE LEGISLATIVE DIRECTION. WE HAD THREE PROPOSITIONS. THE THREE PROPOSITIONS HAD A DIRECTION -- TOWARDS -- LOWERING INCARCERATION. OF HAVING BETTER PROGRAMS IN THE COMMUNITY. AND YET. OF THE POPULATION -- I'M I'M LOOKING AT THE POPULATION. AND I AND I WONDER. I WONDER -- THE QUESTION I HAVE IN THE GENERAL IS WE NEED. TO ASSESS WHETHER OR NOT -- TO IMPLEMENTING THOSE PROPOSITIONS EFFECTIVELY AND INTO THE BEST MATTER THEY CAN. OKAY SO THAT'S SO SO THINGS LIKE. ARE WE CALCULATING -- ELIGIBILITY RELEASE DATES -- PROPERLY IN THE MOST EFFECTIVE MANNER. OF THE DO WE HAVE IN MADE CREDIT EARNING. OF TO MAXIMIZE THEIR CREDIT EARNING YOU MENTION [inaudible] THAT -- LIFERS. WE'RE BE GIVEN SLOTS AND PROGRAMS -- WELL YOU DO THAT THEN YOU YOU MAKE A WAITING LIST FOR PEOPLE THAT WANT TO EARN CREDITS. ESSENTIALLY RIGHT. SO I I I BE CONCERNED ABOUT THAT KIND OF STUFF THE RUNNING OF CREDITS AND WHAT YOUR RULES ARE. THAT GO AGAINST MAYBE THE DIRECTION OF THE THREE PROPOSITIONS AND THE COURT ORDERED DIRECTION. AND THEN THE M. MADE THE SIR OF I'M ALWAYS CONCERNED ABOUT IN MADE -- DISCIPLINARY PROCESSES AND WHETHER OR NOT. WE'RE RECOGNIZING THE MENTAL HEALTH ASPECTS OF THOSE. INMATES AS OPPOSED TO JUST BEING A DESPAIRING -- THE SECURE HOUSING UNITS OF SHOES OR OR USED TO HOUSE. OF PEOPLE THAT HAVE PROBLEMS AND WHETHER OR NOT. THAT IS ADEQUATE -- THE ALBUM IS A QUESTION -- YOUR JUST WARY OF PROCESSING CREDIT FORFEITURES PROCESS. AND ANY OPPORTUNITIES REMINISCES EARNED A CREDITS HOW HOW IS IT INHIBITED BY YOUR REGULATIONS. AND THEN YOUR RELEASE PROCESSES WE HAVE -- PROPOSITION TALKED ABOUT. THE YOU MISSION AGING PRISON POPULATION WORLD WHAT'S GOING ON WITH -- RELEASING AGING PRISONERS I REMEMBER WHEN I WAS IN STOCKTON -- THERE IS A GUY WE'LL BY ME I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WERE WITH ME AT THE TIME BUT I WILL BUY ME IN A WHEELCHAIR AND ASKS YOU LOOK A VERY OLD MAN. HE WAS IN IN YOUR FACILITY AND I I WAS WONDERING HOW OLD WAS. AND YOUR PRISONERS IN THEIR NINETIES AND NOT SURE WHAT A CENTURION. I DON'T THINK WE HAVE THE CENTURION ANYMORE I THINK THOSE ON WHO WERE IN THE NINETIES I WANT TO SAY WE HAVE. I COULD BE WRONG BY OFF ONE OR TWO BUT WE HAVE FIVE OR SIX INMATES IN THE NINETY FIVE OR SIX THEIR INNER NINETIES OKAY SO. NOW AS WELL AS I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY DID OR WHY POINT THE POINT I'M MAKING IS THE YOU KNOW OF THEY'VE. THE VOTERS APPROVE SOMETHING AND SO MAYBE WE OUGHT TO LOOK AT HOW THAT'S BEEN IMPLEMENTED IS THAT EFFECTIVE. I KNOW I KNOW THE COMPASSIONATE RELEASE I'M GOING THROUGH THAT WITH THE PERSON IN MY DISTRICT WHERE. THEY TOOK ALL THE STEPS NECESSARY FOR COMPASSIONATE RELEASE AND WAS SO COMPLICATED TOOK MONTHS AND MONTHS AND MONTHS. AND TWO WEEKS BEFORE THE PERSON WAS SCHEDULED TO BE RELEASED A ROOF THE PERSON DIED IN THE PRESENT. SO IT WAS A TRAGEDY FOR THE FAMILY. PERSON WAS L. ON HER DEATHBED LITERALLY THEY WERE GOING TO RELEASE -- AND WILL BE WITH THE FAMILY AND HE WAS GOING TO PASS AWAY. PASS ON BUT BUT HE A THE COMPLICATED PROCESS WAS. SO COMPLICATED THAT OF HE WASN'T ABLE. TO TO MAKE IT OUT OF THE HOSPITAL IN THE SOLANO HOSPITAL OVER THERE SO SO I THINK I CHECK GO. I THINK WHAT I'M LOOKING ON IS -- THESE POLICIES THAT YOU HAVE TO IMPLEMENT THE PROPOSITIONS. AND WHETHER OR NOT WERE MAXIMIZING THEIR POTENTIAL. TO RELEASE PRISONERS IN AN EFFECTIVE WAY. AND SUPPORT THESE. BY RELEASING THEM -- NEARLY PROGRAMS. THAT OR FUNDED WITH PROP FORTY SEVEN ANOTHER FUNDS THAT WE HAVE -- IN -- PUBLIC SAFETY ARENA YOU KNOW FUNDING PROGRAMS IN THE COMMUNITY. SO I'M INTERESTED IN -- LOOKING AT THAT PARTICULAR -- WITH YOU AND EXPLORING HOW TO BE MORE EFFICIENT AND MEASURE. YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND YOUR REGULATIONS WITHOUT YOUR REGULATION. IMPACT. ON THESE THINGS LIKE RELEASING PRISONERS NOW THE PRIVATE PRISONS -- I A I I JUST SAY THIS -- I DON'T LIKE PRIVATE PRISONS I DON'T THINK THEY HAVE THE STANDARDS OF CARE -- THAT WE HAVE IN OUR FACILITIES AFTER ALL THE DECADE THAT I'VE BEEN HERE WORKING WITH THE COURT ORDER AND ALL THE THINGS WE'VE DONE. TO IMPROVE OUR FACILITIES. THE CAPITAL INVESTMENTS THE THE STAFF INVESTMENTS ALL OF MONEY THAT WE SPENT. AND THEN WE HAVE THESE PRIVATE PRISONS THAT HAVE LIKE. THE JUST NOT EVEN COMPARABLE STANDARDS TO THE STANDARDS THAT WE HAVE. IN OUR FACILITY SO I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT WE WANT -- TO GET PEOPLE OUT OF THOSE PRIVATE. FACILITIES BECAUSE QUITE PERSONALLY I THINK THERE ARE. THERE REALLY -- NOT TREATED THE SAME AS SOMEBODY AND A STATE OWNED OPERATED BILLION WHICH YOU AGREE WITH THE GENERAL CONCEPT. I THINK IN GENERAL I WOULD LIKE TO WHAT I WOULD SAY IS THAT THE OVERSIGHT OF THE PRIVATE FACILITIES IS STILL UNDER THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND WE THE THE STANDARDS THAT WE HAVE IN THE PROGRAMS. THE OVERSIGHT COMES FROM THE DEPARTMENT THERE'S AN THAT WE ADDRESS IT. BUT AS IN HOW TO BEST USE THE THE DOLLARS OF THE CITIZENS THE CALIFORNIA -- I I BELIEVE IN WHAT WE DO INSTEAD OF OUR PRISONS -- BUT I KNOW THIS IS A DELICATE BALANCE ON WE BRING THEM BACK BUT ALSO RECOGNIZING THAT ONE THIRTY SEVEN FIVE NUMBER. AND EVERYTHING THAT YOU BROUGHT UP AND I WROTE DOWN SEVEN POINTS AND IF YOU LIKE I COULD DO I COULD ADDRESS ALL THE SEVEN POINT I DON'T KNOW IF YOU ARE YOU ADDRESS OF OVER THE NEXT FEW MONTHS BUT YEAH OF OF THE PEOPLE OUT. NO NO I APPRECIATE. IN OPPOSITION I'M GIVING YOU MY BASIC [inaudible] I'M GONNA. YEAH BUT I I I I THINK I THINK THE I THINK THAT THE PRIVATE PRISONS. THE STAFF TRAINING THE HIRING POLICIES THAT TYPE OF PEOPLE -- BECAUSE THE PRISONERS OF YOU KNOW AS I I VISITED YOU KNOW QUITE A FEW WITH YOU AND OTHER PEOPLE -- THEY GROW UP TO ABOUT TWENTY FIVE OR SO -- I THINK I'M GOING TO DONOVAN TO THOSE -- DOWN IN YOUR YOU WANT TO GO SINCE SAN DIEGO COUNTY. SO SO -- I THINK I THINK YOU'RE ALL -- YOU KNOW I SEE THE STAFF IS BEING. HIRE TRAIN LEVEL OF TRAINING AND QUALITY THAN. WHAT YOU SEE AND -- PRIVATE LOANS RIGHT I THINK IT'S NOT FAIR TO SAY. AND AND I'D LIKE TO VERIFICATION WE IT'S YOU'RE REFERRING TO ARIZONA IS BECAUSE IT IS OUR ONLY ONE ONLY THAT'S RIGHT. AS WE HAVE SOME IN -- WE HAVE SOME FACILITIES THAT WE HAVE PEOPLE IN THE IT ALL FOR NOW YEAH WE HAVE. YEAH UNDER CONTRACT. BUT IT IS OUR GOAL IT IS OUR GOAL AND I'M CONFIDENT. AND WITH THIS GOAL IN REACHING HAVING ABOUT BY JUNE. YES OKAY SO THOSE ARE MY QUESTIONS I THINK I WANT TO EXPLORE TO OKAY OF THE WORKING WITH YOU AND THE CHAIR. OUR COMMITTEE -- TO ANSWER THOSE QUESTIONS I HAD -- ON THE BUDGET. DOCUMENT -- WANT TO READ IT -- THERE'S A HIT WE'RE GONNA TALK ABOUT MAINTENANCE AND ALL THAT I'M EXCITED ABOUT TALKING ABOUT THAT BECAUSE I THINK. I'VE BEEN LONG WAITING FOR A COMPREHENSIVE MAY I SUPPORT THAT BUT I WANNA I WANNA. I WANT TO KNOW ABOUT -- THE TATTOO REMOVAL. PROGRAM I THINK THAT'S AYE AYE IF IT'S NOT REALLY A KEY FOR THE PRISON IT'S WHAT I HEAR FROM PEOPLE IN THE PRISONS ARE IT'S NOT REALLY SOMETHING THEY WANT. TO DO. BUT THERE'S PEOPLE THAT ARE IN THE COUNTY JAILS AND ALL OVER THEY WANT TO DO IT SO. IT'S IS A BIGGER ISSUE THAN WE MIGHT REALIZE THAT PEOPLE WANT TO REMOVE THEIR TATTOOS ON ESPECIALLY THE FACIAL ONE RIGHT I I AM IN FULL SUPPORT OF THAT -- I THINK WHAT ONCE AN INDIVIDUAL MAKES THAT CHOICE TO REMOVE. THE TATTOO THEY'RE MAKING THAT CHOICE THEY THEY DO WANT. TO HAVE A BETTER CHANCE AT ROCK I HEARD I HEARD FROM A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT IT'S A SCARY PROCESS THIS FOR A I I HAVE HAD FRIENDS WHO HAVE DONE IT AND I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S SCARY YOU KNOW I THINK. THIS IS THE INFO ANYWAY. AND SO -- SO THERE WE WHAT WE WANT TO GET -- BUT I HEAR THERE'S A NEW TECHNOLOGY THAT THE LESS PAINFUL AFTER REMOVAL MACHINE. SO WE WANT TO GET THE ONE THAT I'M NOT SURE I DON'T -- I DON'T HAVE ONE SO I DON'T KNOW. WE MIGHT TELL SOMEBODY MAYBE ONLY AND OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT YEP THE GOT YEAH I KNOW. BUT I HEARD I HEARD THAT THERE'S LESS PAINFUL ONE SO I'M INTERESTED IN WHAT WERE. I LOOK FOR A PROPOSING ON THAT -- SOME PEOPLE SUGGEST A MOBILE OUTSIDE TO REMOVAL SYSTEM. WE CAN MOVE AROUND TO ALL THE PRISONS. I GUESS -- WE'LL TALK ABOUT THAT AT THE TIME AND THANK YOU. THANK YOU MEASURE. ALL RIGHT SO WE'RE GONNA DO PUBLIC. MY MY GOD WE'RE GONNA GET YOUR FROM PUBLIC COMMENT ON THIS ITEM ON THIS OVERVIEW I'M NOT GONNA CALL IN DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE BECAUSE THIS WAS THE OVERVIEW BUT IN OUR NEXT ITEMS PART IN FINANCE WILL COMMENT. SO PUBLIC COMMENT ON THE OVERVIEW NOT ON THE INDIVIDUAL ITEMS THAT ARE STILL BEFORE US ANYONE OVERVIEW. ALL RIGHT WILL NOW MOVE THANK YOU THANK YOU SEC THREE DS OKAY WE WILL NOW MOVE. TO THE FUN BC PEAS. THE END. I'M ISSUE TO THE OUR CONSOLIDATED LEGISLATIVE BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL WHICH ARE -- WE BEGAN TO VISIT A BIT THE ASK FOR ADDITIONAL POSITIONS FOR IMPLEMENTING AB 212-327-2840 FIVE SB NINE SIXTY SB FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE AND SB. FOURTEEN FORTY SEVEN AND WE HAVE OUR WE HAVE HOWARD MOSTLY THE ACTING OFFICE OF LEGAL AFFAIRS IN JOE GALVIN THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR. FOR I SEE THIS YEAR'S POLICY RESEARCH IN INTERNAL OVERSIGHT MEANING INTERNAL AFFAIRS -- SO I'M ASSUMING THAT -- ACTING SECRETARY MOSTLY YOU WANT TO START. I SAW MR GOV AND HAS AN OPEN MISTER GOLDMAN'S GONNA START OKAY. MEMBERS. MY NAME IS JOANNE AND I'M THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE OFFICE. INTERNAL AFFAIRS THE ENTITY WITHIN A GARLIC FORMAL INTERNAL AFFAIRS INVESTIGATOR. YEAH I SAID IF YOU ALLEGATIONS OF EMPLOYEE CRIMINAL AND IT IS ON C. C. R. ANY ADMINISTRATION A MINUTE COOLEY IMPLEMENTING SP FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE TO INCLUDE APPLYING IT RETROACTIVELY. THE FACT WE RECEIVED OUR FIRST REQUESTED A FEW MINUTES AFTER MIDNIGHT. I JUST WANNA MAKE A CORRECTION BECAUSE RETROACTIVE CONTINUES TO BE USED SO COMMONLY. THAT IS NOT IT YOU ARE NOT GOING TO BE IMPLEMENTING IT RETROACTIVELY NOR IS ANY OTHER AGENCY IN THE ENTIRE STATE TO IMPLEMENT THAT BILL RETROACTIVELY WOULD MEAN THAT YOU WOULD BEGIN TO FULFILL REQUESTS THAT YOU RECEIVED. PRIOR TO JANUARY FIRST TWENTY NINETEEN NO ONE IS EXPECTING YOU TO FULFILL REQUESTS RECEIVED PRIOR. TO TWENTY NINETEEN I'M WHAT YOU WILL BE DOING IS. UPON RQUESTS MADE JANUARY FIRST TWENTY NINETEEN AND AFTER YOU WILL BE LOOKING AT ALL RECORDS IN YOUR POSSESSION. AS THE PUBLIC RECORDS ACT REQUIRES SO IT IS NOT AN ISSUE OF RETROACTIVITY AND I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO MAKE THAT CLEAR ON THE RECORD THANK YOU. FOR THE RECORD THAT ADMINISTRATION DEPARTMENT ADOPTS EXACTLY. THE STANCE THAT WAS JUST ARTICULATED BY THE CHAIR. YES MA'AM TRIPOLITAN. REALLY THAT INCORRECTLY. WE RECEIVE UP TO UP TO THIS POINT TWENTY ONE OR TWO WILL WORKING HARD TO FILL THOSE. PROVIDE THE RECORDS. OKAY WEST WERE ALL RECEIVED AFTER JANUARY FIRST TWENTY NINETEEN HONOR AFTER THANK YOU. FOR WE'RE COMMITTED TO CONTINUING FRIDAY. AS THE GATE OF THE DISPLAY PROCESSES. CURRENT LAW UNDER THE GOVERNMENT CODE REQUIRES. A COMPLETE INVESTIGATIONS AND DISCIPLINE AND ALLEGATIONS AGAINST EMPLOYMENT UNDER. WITHIN ONE YEAR OF THE DAY TO DISCOVERY. AND THE NEW LAW REQUIRES WE PROVIDE INFORMATION RELATED TO YOUR REQUESTS AND CERTAIN CATEGORIES -- WITHIN THE SIX MONTHS AFTER THE INCIDENT OCCURS. THE LAWS SOUND POLICY AND WE TOOK IT VERY SERIOUSLY TRY TO FIGURE OUT A WAY THAT WE THOUGHT WE CAN BEST IMPLEMENT THE LAW. AND ROBUST FASHION. FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE DOES NOT REQUIRE US TO EXPEDITE THE TO COMPLETE DESTINATIONS IN SIX MONTHS. WE WERE LOOKING FOR A WAY TO BALANCE THE NEED FOR TRANSPARENCY WHILE MAINTAINING THE INTEGRITY OF THE INVESTIGATIVE PROCESS. AND WE THOUGHT -- THAT COMPLETING INVESTIGATIONS -- DISCIPLINE WITHIN A SIX MONTH TIME PERIOD WOULD BE A GOOD APPROACH -- WE REALIZE OUR PLAN REQUEST IS ONLY ONE WAY TO ADDRESS THIS PROCESS AND THAT OTHER AGENCIES MAY HAVE DIFFERENT INNOVATIVE IDEAS. ON HOW TO BEST THE FROZEN PRO TEMPORE MENTORSHIP. WE WELCOME THE OPPORTUNITY TO REVIEW THE REVIEW THOSE OTHER IDEAS TO WORK WITH YOUR STAFF TO REFINE HOW WE CAN BEST IMPLEMENT THE LAW. THE WAY THAT YOU ENVISION. HOPEFULLY MISTER MILLS IN I CAN ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE NOW YOUR YOUR PCP REQUEST IS NOT ONLY POSITIONS FOR FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE BUT SOME OF THE OTHER BILL SO PERHAPS YOU COULD. GET INTO THAT A LITTLE BIT BECAUSE YEAH HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT AT ALL YEAH AND IF I FORGOT TO INTRODUCE MYSELF BEFORE I MERRICK'S ONCE OF THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF CDC OURS OFFICE OF FISCAL SERVICES. WE DO HAVE THERE ARE FIVE BILLS THAT ARE PART OF THIS LEDGE BCP PROCESS SB FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE WHICH WE JUST TALKED ABOUT. AB TWENTY THREE TWENTY SEVEN AB TWENTY EIGHT FORTY FIVE SB. NINE SIXTY AND SB. FOURTEEN FORTY SEVEN TWENTY ONE SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE IT IS ARE PROBABLY OUR MOST SIGNIFICANT REQUEST THE MAJORITY OF THE POSITIONS. THAT WE HAVE REQUESTED ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THIS BILL BUT WE DO HAVE EXPERTS ON IMPLEMENTING THE OTHER BILLS AS WELL. THERE ARE A TOTAL OF IT'S A TOTAL OF NINE MILLION DOLLARS GENERAL FUND FOR THE B. C. P. FORTY TWO POINT FIVE POSITIONS. IN A BATH OFFICE OF LEGAL AFFAIRS THAT DID JOIN THIS B. C. P. I CAN I REASSURED THE CHAIR WE HAVE RECEIVED TWENTY THREE P. R. A.'S AFTER JOE A JANUARY FIRST ST. I WE DID ACTUALLY RECEIVE SOME P. R. A.'S PRIOR TO THE JANUARY FOR STATE BUT WE MADE IT CLEAR TO THE I REQUEST HERS. THAT THE LIGHT NOT GONE INTO EFFECT YET AND SO THEY OBVIOUSLY A WAITED AND AS MR GALVIN INDICATED WE RESEARCH RECEIVED OUR FIRST REQUEST THE FIRST MINUTE AFTER MIDNIGHT ON JANUARY FIRST. THAT REQUEST -- ASKED FOR ALL FOUR CATEGORY INCIDENTS AND ASK FOR IT FOR THE ENTIRE FIVE YEAR PERIOD I PRIOR TO THAT DATE. AND SO IT WAS A COMPREHENSIVE REQUEST BY MEDIA ORGANIZATION WHICH IS PERMITTED UNDER THE LAW. AND AS MR GALVIN WAS DESCRIBING OUR GOAL IS TO PROVIDE MAXIMUM TRANSPARENCY UP AS THE LAW INTENDED. THERE ARE TO ADD THOSE TWO COMPETING PROVISIONS THE TRANSPARENCY UNDER. FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE AS WELL AS THE OBLIGATION THAT THE OFFICE OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS THE DEPARTMENT HAS AS A WHOLE. TO CONDUCT INVESTIGATIONS WITHIN A ONE YEAR TIME PERIOD LOOKING AT THOSE TWO COMPETING INTERESTS. IT WAS DETERMINED AS A POLICY MATTER THAT AN IDEAL. CHOICE WOULD BE TO ACCOMPLISH ALL OF THE INVESTIGATIONS WITHIN A SIX MONTH PERIOD. TO THE BOTH THE ONE YOU'RE STASHED IMITATIONS AS WELL AS THE SIX MONTH. REQUIREMENT UNDER FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE COULD BE MET. BUT AS MR GALVIN INDICATED THIS IS ONE POLICY CHOICE FOR SOLVING THE PROBLEM WE'RE AWARE NOW THAT THE H. P. AS I SUGGESTED A LIMITED TERM. APPROACH TO THE STAFF SO THAT THEY CAN THEN STUDY THE MATTER AFTER A YEAR TO PERHAPS COME BACK. WITH A MORE -- THE EVIDENCE BASED REQUEST FOR PERMANENT POSITIONS AND THAT CERTAINLY ANOTHER OPTION THAT WE ARE. OPEN TO SO WE PUT WHAT I WOULD DESCRIBE AS OUR BEST FOOT FORWARD -- DESCRIBING THE PERSONNEL THAT WOULD BE REQUIRED IN ORDER TO MEET THE ONE YEAR TIME FRAME. I WITHIN THE SIX MONTH TIME FRAME AND THAT'S HOW THIS. PROPOSAL WAS BUILT AB AGAIN WE ARE CERTAINLY OPEN TO OTHER SUGGESTIONS [inaudible] I'M. ANY COMMENT ANY OF YOU WANT TO MAKE BEFORE WE START ASKING. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE REALLY -- IN THE REST OF US TO START ASKING OR MULTIPLE QUESTIONS ANY COMMENT YOU WANT TO MAKE ABOUT AB TWENTY THREE TWENTY SEVEN AB. TWENTY EIGHT FORTY FIVE SB NINE SIXTY YOUR SB FOURTEEN FORTY SEVEN ALL OF WHICH YOU ALSO HAVE POSITION. REQUESTING. WE HAVE OTHER PANELS I BELIEVE PREPARE TO DISCUSS THE OTHERS IF THAT WAS IF YOU WANT I DID NOT REALIZE THAT I DON'T. I DO NOT HAVE OTHER PEOPLE THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE SPEAKING TO THOSE. WE HAVE THEM AVAILABLE IF YOU WANT TO GET INTO SPECIFICS ON SOME OF THE OTHER BILLS I CAN JUST TALK IN GENERAL ABOUT. ALL THIS THE COMPONENTS OF THE OF THE SPECIES P.. I WILL WE WILL CAN SEE IF THERE'S QUESTIONS. RATHER THAN BRINGING UP MORE PEOPLE TO THE TABLE YET THE LA -- DID YOU HAVE ANY COMMENT. IN RAISE ANY CONCERNS ON THIS PROPOSAL [inaudible] BERMAN FINANCE. NOT ON THE CLEAN DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WE DIDN'T HAVE ANY FURTHER CON ACCEPTED JUST POINT OUT THAT -- WHEN WE DID THE ORIGINAL B. C. P. REQUEST IT WAS TO ENSURE PER LEGISLATION THAT INVESTIGATIVE FINDINGS COULD BE RELEASED WITHIN A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY EIGHT THAT REQUIRES THE DEPARTMENT? AGAIN TO BACK INTO A DATE WHERE THE INVESTIGATION IS COMPLETED AND OTHER RESOURCES ARE PROVIDED. OF THAT WERE IDENTIFIED IN THE BCP WERE TO MEET THOSE TIME FRAMES. ALL RIGHT I'M -- IF MY COMMITTEE MEMBERS WOULD INDULGE ME AS THE AUTHOR. FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE TO GET A LITTLE BIT INTO THIS. SO [inaudible] I'M [inaudible] WHILE. IT MIGHT BE. THERE COULD BE A STRONG ARGUMENT FOR BRIAN TO MAKE SURE THAT WE COMPLETE INVESTIGATIONS AND SIXTY DAYS IS NOT REQUIRED UNDER THE LAW. IS RECOUP THE ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY DAYS AND LET ME BACK UP FIRST. THERE ARE ONLY FOUR CATEGORIES OF RECORDS THAT ARE AVAILABLE UNDER. FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE AND WHEN I EIGHT ASKED IN ADVANCE OF THE HEARING TO TRY TO GET SOME DATA. ON SOME SENSE OF PAST INCIDENTS THAT MIGHT -- YOU KNOW FALL UNDER IT IS YOURS PER VIEW THAT ARE RELEVANT SO IF WE FOR EXAMPLE ONE OF THE CATEGORIES OF DATA. UNDER FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE IS TAMPERING WITH A WITNESS -- INTERFERING WITH THE WITNESS OR TAMPERING WITH EVIDENCE. WHILE THAT COULD PERTAIN TO SOME OF OUR STAFF WITHIN CDC ARE IT'S A LESS LIKELY CATEGORY THAN THAN UNDER. OBVIOUSLY OUR OTHER LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES I'M ANOTHER CATEGORY IS SEXUAL ASSAULT. OF PROVEN SEXUAL ASSAULT. I'M. NOT HARASSMENT NOT BUT PROVEN SO NOW THAT CAN HAPPEN IN A CUSTODIAL CASES OBVIOUSLY BUT ON SO THAT COULD BE A CATEGORY OF RECORDS THAT. THE DCR MAY HAVE. ON THE OTHER. CATEGORY IS. USE OF A WEAPON. FOUR DEADLY FORCE [inaudible] SO. IT AND THAT IS A VERY CAREFULLY DEFINED SO CERTAINLY. ANY TYPE OF ALL IN EVERY TYPE OF FORCE THAT A CUSTODIAL OFFICER MIGHT USE WOULD NOT FALL UNDER THAT CATEGORY [inaudible] I'M. AND AS A RESULT WHEN I LOOKED AT THE DATA THAT WAS PROVIDED WHILE IT'S NOT GRANULAR [inaudible] IT. IT WOULD APPEAR FROM QUICK FOR LANCE THAT THERE WOULD BE FAR FEWER RECORDS. THAT CDC ARE EVEN AS LARGEST POPULATION IS IN AS MANY -- BECAUSE DUTY OFFICERS THAT YOU HAVE. THAT IT WOULD BE FAR FEWER RECORDS THAT WOULD BE EITHER IN YOUR POSSESSION OR EVEN FALL UNDER THE LAW THEN MANY MANY OTHER OF OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES. THAT WAS ONE ISSUE [inaudible] SECONDARILY. THE EXPERIENCE THAT AGENCIES ARE NOW HAVING. OF GETTING THE BROAD REQUESTS GIVE US EVERYTHING YOUR IN YOUR POSSESSION. THAT MIGHT FALL UNDER FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE IS OF COURSE HAPPENING BECAUSE FOR FORTY YEARS. THE PUBLIC AND OTHER HAVE HAD NO ACCESS SO WE YOU KNOW WE KIND OF OPENED UP FOR THE FIRST TIME. SO THAT. AND OF COURSE ONCE THOSE RECORDS ARE RELEASED [inaudible] THEN. THE NEXT REQUEST CAN ONLY BE PERTAIN TO ANYTHING NEW. RIGHT ANY NEW INCIDENT. SO IT IS. BOTH FOR CDC ARE AND FOR AGENCIES HAPPEN ON STATE RIGHT NOW IS GOING TO BE A YOU KNOW YOU'RE GONNA GET THIS IT'S AN INTENSIVE. ALLOCATION OF RESOURCES TO MEET THE REQUEST NOW BUT WILL JUST BY THE VERY NATURE OF THAT YOU'RE ONLY HANDING. OUT. MATERIALS BASED ON COMPLETED INVESTIGATIONS. YOU'RE GONNA HAVE FAR LESS STAFF REQUIREMENT. AND ADDITIONALLY FIRST THE LAW ONLY COVERS COMPLETION OF INVESTIGATIONS ON A HUNDRED EIGHTY DAYS ON THE USE OF DEADLY FORCE. NOT ON THE OTHER [inaudible] THE ONGOING REQUIREMENT TO INCREASE. STAFF FOR INVESTIGATION. IS AGAIN. ONE COULD ARGUE. FOR MORE LIMITED THAN WHAT APPEARS TO BE BEING RECOMMENDED. AND SO WHEN I LOOK AT THE BEAST HE AND I SEE THAT. ONLY SEVEN POSITIONS ARE BEING ASKED [inaudible] FOR TO PROVIDE THE BOARD OF PAROLE HEARINGS RESOURCES TO ADDRESS THE ANTICIPATED INCREASES OF PARDON CONNOTATION REVIEWS. WHICH WE ARE POTENTIALLY EXPECTING TO COVER FAR MORE INMATES AND THE NUMBER OF RECORD YOU MAY HAVE IN YOUR POSSESSION UNDER FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE AND I LOOK AT FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE AS THIRTY POSITIONS I'M LIKE. THIS KIND AT AND THEN WHEN I LOOK AT THE BUT ASK FOR ONLY ONE POSITION FOR SENATE BILL. NINE SIXTY WHICH IS TO COMPLY WITH NEWLY ENACTED SUICIDE WATCH AND I WOULD IMAGINE YOU HAVE QUITE A NUMBER OF INMATES. ATTENTION WE UNDERSTOOD WERE SIDE WATCH AND SO WE'RE ASKING FOR A LOT OF DETAILED REPORTING THAT'S GOING TO BE FOR EVER AND CONSTANT. AND YOURS ONLY NEEDING ONE POSITION VERSES AGAIN THIRTY FTP. FOR FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE I FIND IT VERY HARD TO JUST. BUT I DITION EARLY. IN THIS IS A GENERAL THING IT YOU'LL HEAR FROM ME AGAIN AND AGAIN AND ALL BCP'S WITH NEW FTP IN THIS DEPARTMENT. GIVEN THAT WE ARE. CLEAR THAT WE ARE REDUCING POPULATION. AND WE ARE CLEAR THAT WE MUST BECAUSE WE ARE A COURT ORDER AND WHILE WE NEED. TO DO THINGS EFFECTIVELY IMPROVE AND INCREASE OUR REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMS. DO OTHER THINGS. WE STILL. LOOK AT THE F. T. E. THAT WE HAVE. AND HOW WE MOST EFFECTIVELY USE THEM [inaudible] VERSES. INCREASING F. T.. IN GENERAL BECAUSE THIS IS ONE OF THE FEW AREAS OUR WHAT WE OVER PROVIDE OVERSIGHT ON IS ONE OF THE FEW AREAS OF DISCRETIONARY GENERAL. SO EVERY BIT OF GENERAL FUND THAT WE INCREASE HERE. AND MANY TIMES IT'S VERY LEGITIMATE BUT EVERY BIT OF GENERAL FUND THAT WE INCREASE IN THIS DEPARTMENT. BASICALLY IMPEDES US FROM PROVIDING GENERAL FUND. FOR ANY OTHER PRIORITY TO ME. WHATEVER OTHER PRIORITY THE STATE MAY HAVE ISN'T ALREADY. MANDATED BY NO IT'S NON DISCRETIONARY. SO OF COURSE WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY. YES OPERATE SE WE ARE AT THE HIGHEST QUALITY LEVEL POSSIBLE INTO ABSOLUTELY USE OUR TAXPAYER DOLLARS IN THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY POSSIBLE TO MAKE SURE THAT. WE ARE PROPERLY HOLDING PEOPLE THAT ARE VERY DANGEROUS. AND THAT ANY PEOPLE THAT WE EXPECT TO BE GOING BACK TO A COMMUNITY WE'VE DONE EVERYTHING WE CAN TO MAKE SURE THAT IN THERE THERE RELEASED A ARE HI. GOING TO GO BACK TO THAT COMMITTEE SAFELY. AND NOT -- RESERVE IT SO YES WE MUST DO THAT BUT WHETHER THAT MEANS AN INCREASE IN F. T. P.. GIVEN THAT WE HAVE A REDUCTION IN POPULATION I THINK. NEED TO BE ALWAYS VERY CAREFULLY LOOKED AT AND WHAT I SEE IS EVERY TIME. A BILL PASSES. WELL YES THEY DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE APPROPRIATIONS. YOU COME BACK WITH GIVE US MORE PEOPLE GIVE US MORE PEOPLE NOT. NOT LEGITIMATE IF YOU LOOK AT HOW DO WE UTILIZE. YES WE HAVE NEW PRIORITIES. SO HOW DO WE UTILIZE THE STAFF WE HAVE. TO ADDRESS THOSE NEEDS. SO YOU CAN COMMENT BUT OTHERWISE -- WE CAN -- HERE FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND THEN I CAN CALL MY COLLEAGUES. ALL THE CHAIRS POINTS ARE WELL TAKEN AND BASED ON A STAFFER QUESTIONS LEADING UP TO THE COMMITTEE MEETING AND AND OTHER ENQUIRIES. IT'S BECOME APPARENT TO US THAT WE NEED TO WORK WITH THE STAFF AND BASICALLY RE ENGINEER THE MODEL. I I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT THAT WHAT CAME FORWARD WAS MEANT IN THE BEST OF INTENTIONS IT WASN'T. SIMPLY TO AUGMENT A FOR A PARTICULAR PERIOD. THAT IS THE BUBBLE THAT I THINK AT THE CHERRY IT WAS ACTUALLY A RECONSIDERATION OF THE MODEL. AND WHERE THE CURRENT STAFFING AND THE CURRENT MODEL WITH IT'S TIME LINES WAS BUILT ON THE PREVIOUS WHEN YOU'RE STASHED IMITATIONS. IT WAS AN EFFORT TO ACCOMPLISH THAT WORK IN A SIX MONTH PERIOD OF TIME SO THAT THERE WOULD BE COMPLETED INVESTIGATIONS AVAILABLE FOR RELEASE. UNDER FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE SO IT WAS A REIMAGINE OF THE MODEL OF THE TIMELINE THAT. CREATED THE INCREASE BUT I THINK YOU KNOW WITH THE CLEAR DIRECTION IS BEING PROVIDED IN THE INPUT. I WE CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THAT WE NEED TO RETURN AND LOOK AT THE ACTUAL NUMBERS AND PERHAPS THAT A GRAND SLAM WE WERE SWINGING. FOR NEEDS TO BE ADJUSTED TO SOME OF THE REALITIES THAT -- THE TEARS DESCRIBING WE'RE CERTAINLY HAPPY TO ANSWER AS MANY QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW THIS PROPOSAL WAS PUT TOGETHER AND WHAT THE AIRLINES SECTIONS ABOUT IT WERE -- BUT I I SAY THIS KNOWING THAT IN THE END THERE'S MORE WORK TO BE DONE IN THIS AREA. FRANCE AND YOU WANT TO MAKE A COMMENT. RICH MY DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I CAN SPEAK A LITTLE BIT MORE TO METHODOLOGY OF SB FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE HOW WE CAME TO THAT REQUEST -- JEEZ I DID NOT ALSO POINT OUT THAT IN THE DOCUMENT. THAT WE RECEIVED IT DOES SHOW AS YOU STATED THAT WAS BASED ON A SIXTY DAY INVESTIGATIVE PERIOD AND I HAVE TO WONDER. WHY APPRECIATE EXPLANATION THAT WAS GIVEN HERE? THE ORIGINAL THE LANGUAGE OF THE BILL BEFORE IT WAS AMENDED SO BEFORE IT WAS SIGNED BEFORE IT FINALIZED IN THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS BEFORE WE SIGN. DID HAVE A SIXTY DAY INVESTIGATORY PERIOD AROUND THE USE OF FORCE BUT THAT WAS CHANGED TO ONE EIGHTY SO I I HAVE TO WONDER WHETHER. THE THIS IS SESSION WAS BASED ON IN INACCURATE READING OF THE FINAL BILL. I FELT THEIR THEM FOR THE PART OF FINANCE COMMENTS I THINK IT'S THAT COMES DOWN TO THE TIMELINE THAT WE CONSIDER THE ACTUAL INVESTIGATION GENERALLY KERN THERE'S A PERIOD OF TIME. WHEN THE GRIEVANCE TO THE ALLEGATION IS IS BROUGHT FORWARD -- WHERE IT'S -- BROUGHT TO I WAS REFERRED TO AS THE TION OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS. AND THEN IT GOES TO INVESTIGATION THERE NEEDS TO BE TIME LEFT ON THAT END OF THE INVESTIGATION FOR BOTH -- THE HIGHER THREE TO REACH DECISIONS AND FOR ANY NOTICE OF ADVERSE ACTION TO BE ISSUED TO EMPLOYEES SO. IN REFERENCE IN THE SIXTY DAYS I DON'T BELIEVE IT WAS A MIS READ OF THE LEGISLATIVE CHANGE. IT WAS TRYING TO CAPTURE THE PERIOD OF TIME THAT EXIST BEFORE ALL OF THE IN TAKES STEPS GET TO AN AGENT FOR INVESTIGATION. AND WHEN THE AGENT IS OBLIGATED TO COMPLETE THAT INVESTIGATION SO THAT ALL THE FINALIZATION STEPS CAN PROPERLY OCCUR BEFORE THE TIMELINE IS MATT SO IT'S A COLLAPSED WINDOW. THAT IS CORRECT THERE'S ALSO AN ADDITIONAL TIME AFTER. WHERE IT'S AT THE INSTITUTIONAL LEVEL WHERE IT'S BEING REVIEWED? MAY GO THROUGH THE INSTITUTIONAL USE OF FORCE COMMITTEE BY JENNIFER BEFORE EVEN COMES TO THE INTERNAL AFFAIRS. CONSIDER FOR INVESTIGATION. AND SO BACK YET THAT AND HUNDRED EIGHTY DAYS ENCOMPASS THE INTEGRITY OF INCIDENT OCCURRING WHAT HAPPENS IF HE'S. LEVEL COMING TO INTERNAL AFFAIRS INTAKE MOVING TO INVESTIGATION MOVING TO DISCIPLINE AND TAKING DISCIPLINARY ACTION. SO WHAT CLASS. BERMAN FINANCE GO AHEAD. I WOULD LIKE IN THE DEPARTMENT THAT YES WE DO CONSIDER THE ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY TWO DAY TIME FRAME AND THAT IS ONLY APPLY TO THE USE OF FORCE AND WEAPONS CASES. AND A FURTHER MORE ONLY THOSE ADMINISTRATIVE CASES WHICH CAN'T BE DELAYED IF THEY'RE SUBJECT TO CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION THE DEPARTMENT HAS THE OPPORTUNITY. TO DEFER A RELEASE OF THOSE RECORDS UNTIL THE INVESTIGATION IS COMPLETE SO THIS. UP REQUEST WAS JUST TARGETED ON THE USE OF FORCE WEAPONS HE SAYS. THAT WERE ADMINISTRATIVE THAT NEEDED TO BE LIMITED TO UNDER THE SPELL [inaudible] I'M. CENTER MORE LIKE SINCE YOU WERE ASKING SOME YOU WERE. LEGITIMATELY HAD SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT THESE BE THESE INCREASE OF PETITIONS PLEASE YOU MAY PROCEED WITH US THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR -- AT TWELVE A ONE YOU RECEIVE HER REQUEST. FOR ALL FOUR CATEGORIES FOR FIVE YEARS IN IN IN COULD YOU REPEAT. THE A NUMBER MOST PURE REYES YOU HAVE TO RESPOND WITHIN TEN BUSINESS DAYS BUT FOR THIS REQUEST WHAT IS YOUR DEADLINE. WITHIN TEN DAYS YOU PROVIDE A RESPONSE WHICH OFTENTIMES INDICATES HOW MUCH TIME IT WILL RECENTLY TAKE. TO ASSEMBLE THE DOCUMENTS I IN SOME INSTANCES YOU CAN EXTEND THAT TEN DAY RESPONSE TO ANOTHER FOURTEEN DAY RESPONSE A TWENTY FOUR WHERE YOU'VE IDENTIFIED PERHAPS SOME COST FACTORS OR GIVEN THE VERY SIZE OF IT -- YOU'RE ASKING FOR SOME CLARIFICATION AND OTHER STEPS SO IN THIS INSTANCE THAT COMMITMENT IS BEEN MADE. TO COMPLY WITH THE FULL REQUEST BY JUNE THIRTIETH SO A SIX MONTH PERIOD YOU CAN FLUCTUATE THE AMOUNT OF TIME TO ACTUALLY PRODUCE DOCUMENTS. BASED ON THE VOLUME BUT YOU MUST RESPOND WITHIN TEN DAYS TO INFORM THEM THAT YOU'VE RECEIVED IT AND WHAT YOUR INTENSE ARE GOING FORWARD. THOUGH THE REQUEST YOUR OF THE SIX MONTH. TIME FRAME ARE YOU YOU'VE JUST BE MY SAID THIS IS WHAT IT TAKES. AND NOT NOT USUALLY THERE'S A COMMUNICATION AND THE OTHER SIDE THE REQUESTED -- MAY INDICATE THAT THEY THEY DON'T WISH TO WAIT THAT LONG SO THEY'LL TRIM DOWN THE REQUEST. I'M OR YOU HOPEFULLY REACH SOME COMPROMISE AND PERHAPS STAGING THE REQUESTED SOME MATERIALS ARE PROVIDED AT ONE POINT IN TIME. AND THEN A DEEPER DIVE FOR DOCUMENTS IS DONE IN AT A LATER TIME IT'S PRODUCED THERE A LOT OF DIFFERENT WAYS -- TO STRUCTURE THAT. GIVEN THAT HAVE. MAXIMUM AT REQUEST. AT SIX MONTHS I WAS OFFERED AS AS A COMPLETION DATE FOR THE ENTIRE PROJECT. ONCE YOU COMPLETE THIS PROJECT IN SIX MONTHS YOU HAVE ADDRESSED EVERY. EVERYONE IN YOUR IN YOUR ENTIRE DEPARTMENT RIGHT YOU'VE YOU'VE COVERED AT ALL. I THINK THE POINT IN IT WAS MADE EARLIER IS CORRECT EXCEPT FOR SOME NEW WANTS AND THAT IS THAT. UPON IDENTIFIED ALL THE DOCUMENTS THERE'S A REDUCTION PROCESS AND SO BASED ON THE REQUEST -- YOU MAY BE REDACTING PORTIONS OF THE RECORD THAT PERTAINED OTHER INDIVIDUALS -- AND THEN A SUBSEQUENT REQUEST MAY COME IN FOR THE SAME INCIDENT BUT THEY'RE ASKING ABOUT A DIFFERENT -- INDIVIDUAL AND SO YOUR READ DR THE OPPOSITE NOW IN THIS CASE WHERE THE REQUEST IS -- FOR EVERY CONCEIVABLE RELEASABLE THE GOAL WOULD BE. TO CONDUCT THE REDUCTIONS ARCHIVE THOSE MATERIALS SO THAT IF A SIMILAR REQUEST COMES IN THE FUTURE. THEN IT'S EASILY AVAILABLE AND RELEASED IN A MUCH SHORTER PERIOD TIME YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. WELL THEN. I GUESS WHERE I'M GOING IS AFTER SIX MONTHS OF AN ANSWER. WORK [inaudible] YOU'RE DONE. SO I THINK WE WOULD HAVE TO BUY FOR KATE THAT THE P. R. A REQUEST OF THIS B. C. P. AND INVESTIGATORY. SO I THINK YOU'RE CORRECT WHEN YOU'RE DESCRIBING THAT THE P. R. A. PROCESSING. ESPECIALLY WHEN THIS -- ONE LARGE PR REYES COMPLETED WILL BE A MATTER OF REPRODUCING THOSE OR REDACTING FUTURE INCIDENTS. BUT THE THE LARGE REQUEST FOR INVESTIGATORY STAFF DON'T RELATE TO THE FIVE PASSED YEARS BECAUSE THOSE INVESTIGATIONS OF BY LARGE BEEN COMPLETED. THEY RELATED TO A GOAL OF MODIFYING THE ENTIRE PROGRAM GOING FORWARD. SO THAT ALL INVESTIGATIONS OF INCIDENTS THAT WOULD FALL UNDER. FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE WOULD BE COMPLETED IN THAT SIX MONTH WINDOW SO THEY WERE REALLY TO REQUEST IMBEDDED ONE WAS -- THE SMALLER IF YOU WILL WHICH WAS TO PROCESS THE R. A.'S THE PAPERWORK AND THAT DOES HAVE THE BUBBLE AFFECT THAT YOU'RE DESCRIBING. BUT THE LARGER REQUEST FOR FOR AGENTS AND FOR SOME ATTORNEYS WHO ARE PART OF THAT INVEST TOWARD PROCESS UNDER THE MADRID CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT. WHICH I MEAN IF YOU WANT THAT WAS ABOUT CREATE A MODEL DESTINATIONS THAT USED TO BE COMPLETED WITHIN A YEAR WOULD BE COMPLETE IN SIX MONTHS ANTICIPATING FUTURE FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE REQUESTS. SO THAT'S WHY I DESCRIBED DAM THE THE THE INITIAL IMPRESSION ABOUT A BUBBLE. PERTAINS TO THE REQUESTED HAVE COME IN AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS YEAR. FOR INFORMATION GOING BACK IN TIME -- UP TO THIS FIVE YEARS. BUT DID THE LARGE DRIVER OF THE B. C. P. ) ADDITIONAL INVESTIGATIVE STAFF SO THAT. FROM THIS POINT FORWARD. OUR INVESTIGATIONS OF THAT NATURE WOULD BE COMPLETED IN SIX MONTHS THAT'S MEDIAN THE SAME TIME FRAME AS THE FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE IT WOULD BE THE INVESTIGATION AND THE DISCIPLINARY. PROCESS SO THAT IT WILL HAVE A COMPLETE RECORD. OF WHAT OCCURRED. SO IN THE MEANTIME. IT'S ALL HANDS ON DECK A. B. RIGHT NOW YEAH. THAT'S CORRECT CENTER AND ARE YOU RETAINING ANY -- TEMPORARY. SERVICES THAT BACKYARD BURGER FOR THE CURRENT RATHER DEPARTMENTS OR A GESTURE OPTING FOR THAT FOR THE CURRENT -- WAVE IF YOU WILL -- THERE'VE BEEN A LOT OF RE DIRECTED STAFF. AND SO -- WE ARE COVERING THE WORKLOAD OBVIOUSLY AT SOME POINT I WHATEVER THE C. P. ARGUMENTATION IS IS AGREED. TO I WOULD PERSONALLY COME ONLINE JULY FIRST AND THEN THAT WORK WOULD BE HANDED OVER TO THE PERMANENT THAT TEAM. I WHATEVER SIZE -- THAT CONSISTS OF BUT AT THE CURRENT TIME MEMBERS HAVE BEEN REDIRECTED IN PARTICULAR FOR THE THE LARGE GLOBAL. I REQUEST THAT WAS RECEIVED I SHOULD SAY THERE ARE YOU KNOW OTHER REQUESTS IN THE TWENTY THREE SOME OF THEM ARE SINGULAR SOME OF THEM ARE -- A REQUEST FROM A PUBLIC DEFENDER ABOUT A PARTICULAR OFFICER IN PARTICULAR INCIDENT. I SOME ARE PERHAPS -- ENTIRE INCIDENT FROM A MEDIA OUTLETS -- BUT IN AS MUCH AS A FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE IS OPEN TO THE ENTIRE PUBLIC BE THEY MEDIA. INMATES OBVIOUSLY ARE FREE TO USE THAT PUBLIC DEFENDERS PROSECUTORS YOU KNOW EXPECT OVER TIME TO SEE -- FOLKS GET FAMILIAR WITH THE BILL AND TAKE ADVANTAGE OF ITS TRANSPARENCY BUT IT THIS TIME. WE ARE SITTING ON THE TWENTY THREE WITH THE ONE LARGE REQUEST AND PROCESSING THAT AS EXPEDITIOUSLY AS WE CAN. THANK YOU THANK YOU AFTER. CERTAINLY CENTER WERE LIKE IN I AM. THINK WHAT A IN ALSO IMPORTANT TO NOTE AS IN. YOU -- IN YOUR QUESTION. WE WILL WAS REPORTED TO US THAT YOU ARE REDIRECTING STAFF. AND THAT THIS EVEN IF WE WERE TO APPROVE THESE THE WOMEN TAKE AFFECT UNTIL JULY ONE AND THEN OF COURSE YOU'D HAVE TO HIRE SO MAYBE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT OCTOBER NOVEMBER. SO A GIVEN THAT THE THE AS YOU RIGHTFULLY POINTED OUT IN AND YOUR QUESTION AROUND IF YOU HAVE A DATA DUMP. OR A REQUEST LIKE YOU HAVE RECEIVED WHICH IS GIVE US EVERYTHING. EVEN IN SUBSEQUENT REQUESTS THAT MIGHT BE ABOUT INCIDENT. X. OR Y. ONLY YOU WOULD OF ALREADY PROCESSED AT LEAST SOME OF LARGE PORTION OF THAT. SO THAT'S THE TIME. FOR RESPONDING THAT REQUEST IS GREATLY CONDENSED. SO GOING FORWARD WE'RE GOING TO HAVE. MUCH LESS OF A AGAINST ON ONGOING WORK BUT NARROWER NATURE. SO JUST WANNA MAKE SURE WE HAD. THAT POINTED OUT THANK YOU. YES YOU MAY RESPOND GO AHEAD YES WITH REGARDS -- TO PULLING THOSE RECORDS FROM CASCADE [inaudible] RIGHT [inaudible] SEVEN YEAH. WAS THE MOVIE FOR WITH RESPECTIVE CASES THAT MAKE A DIFFERENCE. OKAY. SO IN THE TERMS OF YOUR RESPONSE AROUND TO DESIRE. TO HANDLE YOUR INVESTIGATIONS DIFFERENTLY I THINK YOU SHOULD HAVE SEPARATED THE PCP BECAUSE THERE'S NOTHING IN. OUR WHAT FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE THAT REQUIRES YOU TO OTHER THAN THE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY DAYS. SO IF THERE'S A DESIRE TO HANDLE INVESTIGATIONS DIFFERENTLY I THINK IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN SUBMITTED SEPARATELY. SO THAT WE COULD DISCUSS THAT IN DETAIL AND WHY WE MIGHT AND WHAT OTHER CASES MEANING THE MADRID IN OTHER CASES. MIGHT -- JUSTIFIER BEARD. THREE READ RATIONALE FOR THAT UNDERSTOOD IN A FAIR POINT. UNDER BILL DID YOU HAVE ANY SOME. BUDGET PROPOSAL INCLUDE -- OUR STATE [inaudible] PRIVATE FACILITIES. IN AS MUCH AS WE MAINTAIN THE RECORDS AND WE DO HAVE MANY RECORDS ABOUT INCIDENTS THAT OCCURRED. AT THE ODYSSEY FACILITIES THEN THE P. R. A. WOULD APPLY THAT INCLUDE -- RECORDS OF THE PRIVATE OPERATIVE. NONE OF THOSE RECORDS ARE KEPT SEPARATE THEIR REQUEST WOULD HAVE TO MADE OF THEM. BUT AT ANY RECORDS THAT ARE WITHIN THE CONTROL OR THE CUSTODY OF THE APARTMENT. ADD WOULD FALL UNDER THE P. R. A LOT WHEN WE PASS LAWS DO YOU MODIFY THEIR CONTRACTS TO INCLUDE. IMPLEMENTATION OF OUR LAWS THAT WE PASS -- BUT WE CERTAINLY APPLY ALL OF OUR AT OUR RULES AND OUR POLICIES THROUGH OUR CONTRACTS TO THE IS. A PRIVATE INSTITUTION SO YOU'RE GOING TO CHANGE -- CONTRACTS TO IMPLEMENT. SOME OF THESE LAWCENTER AT THE CURRENT CONTRACTS -- THAT ARE EXPIRING. WE WON'T HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO TO MODIFY THEM A LONGER THEY'RE GOING TO BE IN THOSE FACILITIES. AT THE GOAL AS THE SECRETARY MENTIONED WAS. NO FURTHER INMATES IN THE ARIZONA FACILITIES AFTER JUNE THIRTIETH. THIS YEAR CORRECT THIS YEAR -- IF SOMEBODY CALLS UP AND ONCE RECORDS. NOW FROM SOMETHING IS HAPPENING DOWN THERE. FEEL AS RIVAL OPERATOR THEY CAN'T GET THE RECORDS UNLESS. IF THOSE RECORDS IN THE DEPARTMENT'S CUSSING CONTROL THEY CAN GET THOSE RECORDS IF THOSE ARE SEPARATE -- RECORDS THAT ARE THE PURVIEW OF THE CONTRACTOR I THAN THEY WOULD HAVE TO MAKE THE RECALL THANK YOU OKAY I THINK I THINK WE WE YOU WANT TO EXPLORE. MAKING SURE THAT IF THERE'S ANY. I DON'T WANT TO HAVE A TWO TIERED. I THANK OF SOMEBODY ELSE FOR SO IS SOMETHING HAPPENS IN ARIZONA. AND THEY ASKED FOR THE RECORD. THEY CAN'T GET IN BECAUSE OF SOME REASON THE PRIVATE OFFICER DOESN'T WANT TO DISCLOSE THEM AND I WOULD BE -- THAT WOULD BE NOT IMPLEMENTING THESE BILLS OKAY THAT THE LAWS OF THE HOUSE THAT'S OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU THANK YOU CENTER ROLE IN -- I USED. OUR USE THE NUMBER OF POSITIONS AND THINGS LIKE AB. TWENTY THREE TWENTY SEVEN AND AB TWENTY EIGHT FORTY FIVE AND OTHERS. IN MY COMPARISON BUT REALLY WE COULD HAVE LOOKED AT MORE CLOSELY AT SB. FOURTEEN FORTY SEVEN WHICH COMPLIES WITH ASKS THE DEPARTMENT A COMPLY WITH NEW PRESCRIPTION AUTHORIZATION REQUIREMENTS. AND IT AFFECTS THIRTY FIVE LOCATIONS THIRTY FIVE DIFFERENT PHARMACIES. AND IT REQUIRES. MORE -- DEALING WITH AFTER OUR PRESCRIPTIONS AND YET IT ONLY ASKS US FOR TWO PEOPLE SO IT'S A ONGOING THING FOR THIRTY FIVE LOCATIONS. POTENTIALLY TWENTY FOUR SEVEN SO I JUST IS ANOTHER COMPARES IN SCALE. WE APPRECIATE THE CHEST BY A THANK YOU I'M. THE PUBLIC COMMENT ON THIS SIDE. OKAY SEEING NONE WE WILL NOW MOVE TO ISSUE THREE ALLOCATION FOR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE. THANK YOU. FOR THE OUR NEXT ITEM IS A REQUEST FOR A ONE TIME INCREASE OF TWENTY FIVE MILLION FOR SPECIAL CARE TO FOR MAINTENANCE PROJECTS AROUND THE STATE AT OUR FACILITIES. OUR SUBJECT MATTER EXPERT FOR THIS ISSUE END OF THE NEXT TWO ISSUES IS DEAN BORG. DEPUTY DIRECTOR FACILITY PLANNING CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT. RIGHT GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS -- AS MENTIONED -- THIS -- BCP FOR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE FUNDING IS TWENTY FIVE MILLION AS A ONE TIME B. C. P. -- SIMILAR TO WHAT THE LEGISLATURE LAST SEVERAL BUDGET CYCLES -- IN A SECTION SIX POINT -- ONE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE OF PROGRAM. LET ME EXPLAIN A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW WE PRIORITIZE OUR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE -- PROJECTS -- OUR INSTITUTIONS WILL SUBMIT DEFERRED MAINTENANCE PROJECTS -- TO HEADQUARTERS ON A FLOW BASIS WE DO DO WHAT'S CALLED A CALL LETTER ONCE A YEAR TO SAY PLEASE ENSURE YOU SUBMITTED EVERYTHING BUT IF -- NEEDS ARE IDENTIFIED BETWEEN THAT CALL LATER ON THE NEXT CALL LETTER -- THEY WILL SUBMIT THOSE -- PROJECT REQUESTS ON A FLOW BASIS. ANNUALLY AT THE START OF EACH FISCAL YEAR WE WILL GO THROUGH ALL THE REQUEST THAT WE RECEIVED AND DO A PRIORITIZATION BASED ON A VARIETY OF FACTORS -- IS THE PROJECT REQUEST NECESSARY TO MAINTAIN EXISTING OPERATIONS AND HOUSING INMATE PROGRAMMING HEALTHCARE -- IS IT NECESSARY TO COMPLY WITH REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS -- ARE THEY REQUIRE IS A PROJECT THE CONDITIONS FOR A INMATES OR STAFF. OR IS IT NECESSARY TO ADDRESS -- COURT MANDATES. SO WITH THAT PRIORITIZATION WILL END UP WITH EACH YAR ABOUT THIRTY PROJECTS THAT WE ARE PRIORITIZING TO START MOVING FORWARD ON AND OFF IN CASES THAT MEANS STARTING A DESIGN PROCESS FOR THESE PROJECTS -- THAT DESIGN PROCESS DEPENDING ON THE SCOPE OF THE PROJECT COULD TAKE ANYWHERE FROM TWELVE TO EIGHTEEN MONTHS. SO OUR PRIORITIZATION PROCESS ESSENTIALLY AND IN ONE FISCAL YEAR WILL IDENTIFY PROJECTS TO START THE DESIGN WITH THE EXPECTATION THAT IN THE NEXT FISCAL YEAR OR THE FISCAL YEAR FOLLOWING THAT. ONE THAT PROJECT WILL BE FULLY DESIGNED AND READY TO MOVE INTO CONSTRUCTION SO IT'S A MULTI YEAR PROCESS FOR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE PROJECTS VERY SIMILAR TO OUR CAPITAL OUTLAY PROJECTS. SO -- IT THE AND NOW SAYS DID IDENTIFY THAT -- WE HAD NOT PREVIOUSLY REACHED PROVIDED A LIST OF WHAT THE TWENTY FIVE MILLION PROJECTS ARE -- WE HAVE NOW -- EARLIER THIS WEEK -- PROVIDED THAT TO THE COMMITTEE AND TO THE LA -- SO WE CAN ANSWER ANY ONGOING QUESTIONS -- YOU KNOW BE ON OF THE ON THIS HEARING X. AND IF ANYBODY DID WANT TO COPY I HAVE ADDITIONAL THAT THE SERGEANT COULD PASS OUT SO -- PLEASE LET ME KNOW. THE PROJECTS ARE ON HERE VERY CONSISTENT WITH THE PROJECTS THE DEPARTMENT HAS UTILIZED THE PREVIOUS YEAR'S FUNDINGS FOR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE -- ON SO IT'S A FAIRLY CONSISTENT WITH THE PRIOR -- THE PRAYER REQUESTS -- AM VEILED AND ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS AND AND AS I SAID IF ANYONE WANTS TO SEE A COPY OF IT -- AGAIN OF THE SORT WE HAD REYES AGAINST THE DEPARTMENT HAD PROVIDED A PROVIDED A LIST OF SPECIFIC PROJECTS OR INSPIRATION EXPLANATION OF HOW IT HAD PRIORITIZE THIS PROJECT FROM ITS BACKLOG. THE BERMAN HAS SENSE -- PROVIDED BOTH OF THOSE THINGS SO -- WE WILL CERTAINLY BE REVIEWING THE LIST AND COMMUNICATE ANY CONCERNS WE IDENTIFY -- WE JUST RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE MAKE SURE THAT THAT PRIORITIZATION METHOD IN THE LIST OF SPECIFIC PROJECTS MATCH. FOR SOME REPORTING REQUIREMENTS THAT WE THINK WOULD ENABLE BETTER LGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT OVER. ONGOING MAINTENANCE ISSUES. I'M AND THE FIRST WOULD BE -- SOME SUPPLEMENTAL REPORTING LANGUAGE REQUIRING CDC ARE TO IDENTIFIED BY TWENTY TWENTY THREE HOW THEIR BACK A DEFERRED MAINTENANCE BACK BETWEEN TWENTY NINETEEN AND TWENTY TWENTY THREE AND TO THE EXTENT IT GROWS OVER THAT TIME PERIOD. TO IDENTIFY REASONS FOR THE GROWTH AND OF WHAT WHAT STEPS IS TAKING. TO MITIGATE THAT GROWTH. I'M AND THEN WE ALSO RECOMMENDS. REQUIRING THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TO REPORT ON WHAT DEFERRED MAINTENANCE PROJECTS ARE ULTIMATELY FUNDED WITH WHATEVER RESOURCES ARE PROVIDED IN THAT TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY BUDGET [inaudible] THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING ERIN EDWARDS WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE -- I THINK I WOULD JUST LIKE TO TO NOTE THAT WE THINK THIS IS AN IMPORTANT INVESTMENT -- WE TALK A LOT ABOUT -- MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE SAFE SECURE FACILITIES -- THAT ARE CONDUCIVE TO PROVIDING REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMMING AND TO PROVIDING ADEQUATE HEALTHCARE INFRASTRUCTURE -- AND IN THESE SORTS OF INVESTMENTS ARE THAT THE TYPE OF INVESTMENTS WE NEED TO MAKE. IT TO ENSURE THAT OUR PRISONS DO WE ALL AGREE ON IN TERMS OF VIA. THE ALLEY -- RECOMMENDATIONS ON PROVIDING REPORTING LANGUAGE ALL AT THE DEPARTMENT IS TO SPEAK TO THAT BUT I I THINK IN GENERAL -- WE TRY TO BE AS FORTHCOMING AS WE CAN BE WITH INFORMATION ABOUT -- WHAT PROJECTS WERE FUNDING AND I I DON'T HAVE ANY CONCERNS WITH GENERALLY PROVIDING THAT SORT OF INFORMATION TO THAT THE LEGISLATURE? THEN YOUR BELT -- HOW WE APPROACH THE MADE US I I I THINK IT HAS AS TO BE -- PART OF OUR BUDGET AND I'M GLAD WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IT -- I THINK THEY'RE A GOOD WAY OF DOING MAINTENANCE PROJECTS ON A ONE TO HEAR YOUR OPINION. IS TO TO LOOK AT SERVE THE ONGOING MAINTENANCE COSTS. AND THEN LOOK AT ANOTHER CATEGORY WOULD BE -- DEFERRED MAINTENANCE BACKLOG THINGS THAT WERE DONE THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN DONE A WHILE AGO. BUT YOU HAVE A LIST OF THOSE THAT. IF YOU TAKE CARE OF OF THEN -- YOU DON'T HAVE TO TAKE CARE MANY MORNING HAVE ONGOING MAINTENANCE A REGULAR MAINTENANCE. UP I SEE THESE LIST AS KIND OF A MORE WITH THE FOR MAINTENANCE BACKLOG WITH. PRIVATE THAT WAY. YES THE LIST HAS TO DO WITH THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE PROJECTS THAT THE INSTITUTION IF MORE ADEQUATELY FUNDED IN THIS LEADS INTO THE NEXT ITEM -- ON ON THE AGENDA -- IF IF WE HAD ADEQUATE FUNDING AT THE LEVEL THESE ARE PROJECTS AND IN SOME CASES THE INSTITUTION COULD HAVE BEEN DOING -- THROUGH MULTI YEAR PLANNING -- KNOWING WHAT THEIR BUDGET IS-GOING TO BE BUT BECAUSE OF WHERE THE BUDGET HAS BEEN OVER THE LAST FIVE TO TEN YEARS. IT GETS REALLY FOR SO SO. SO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING TO ME YOUR IS. IF YOU HAD THE TOP TO YOUR MAINTENANCE BACKLOG. PROJECTS. THESE ARE THE THESE THIS IS STILL THE TOP TIER BUT WAS THERE AN ARTIFICIAL. LIMIT YOU SAID TWENTY FIVE MILLION THIRTY MILLION WHAT WAS THE REASON. FOR THE DOLLAR AMOUNT THAT YOU -- SELECTED OR WAS SELECTED TERMS OF THIS BUDGET REQUEST AND AND WHAT IS THE OVERALL SIZE OF THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE BACKLOG. AS REPORTED BY OUR INSTITUTIONS THE SIZE OF THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE BACKLOG IS IS APPROXIMATELY BILLION DOLLARS AT THIS TIME OKAY SO THIS IS A CHIP AWAY KIND OF A BUDGET REQUEST. AND AND AND AND I MEAN IT IT'S SO IT'S A IS IT A COUPLE OF THEM FACTORS ONE HAS TO DO WITH WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THE THE THE BAND WITH THE ABILITY TO MOVE THESE FOR PROJECTS FORWARD SO SOMETHING THAT WAS. NOT TWENTY FIVE MILLION BUT SEVENTY FIVE MILLION EIGHTY MILLION -- MAY NOT ALL MOVE FORWARD -- IN AN EXPEDITIOUS MANNER MANNER AS WE CAN WITH TWENTY FIVE MILLION AND THESE ARE PROJECTS THAT WE PRIORITIZE. A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO MOVING THROUGH THE DESIGN -- AT AT AT THIS. RATE OF YOU -- YOU SEE THE MADE A BACKLOG. GROWING. GIVEN THE FACT THEY'RE ALWAYS SPENDING TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS YOUR OUR ON DEFERRED MAINTENANCE BACKLOG HERE. THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE BACKLOG WILL CONTINUE TO GROW UNTIL WE CAN ADDRESS THE ABILITY FOR THE INSTITUTIONS ON AN ANNUAL BASIS TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS A LOT OF THESE PROJECTS -- WITH -- WITH THEIR OWN FUNDING WHICH AGAIN TIES INTO THE NET RESULT ROUSEY'S QUESTION IS. A LOOK AT THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE BACKLOG AS A NUMBER AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE NUMBER. YOU DON'T WANT TO GROW YOU WANNA SHRINK THE NUMBER. BUT IF YOU DON'T SPEND ENOUGH MONEY ON SHIPPING AWAY OUT AT THE MAIN AS BACKLOG WILL GROW. AND WE HAVE TO FIND THAT SWEET SPOT WE'RE IT ACTUALLY STARTS TO SHRINK. THE MAINTENANCE BACKLOG. OF WHERE WOULD YOU SAY THAT NUMBER WOULD BE. IT'S I'D I'D I DON'T HAVE A SPECIFIC DOLLAR NUMBER BUT I THINK IT IS A COMBINATION OF LIFE OF WHAT YOU'RE DOING AND ALL THAT. STUFF TO YOU BY. IT'S IT'S A COMBINATION OF THESE ONE TIME DEFERRED MAINTENANCE UP OPERATIONS ADMIN COMING PREVIOUSLY IN SECTION SIX POINT -- ONE AND NOW IN THIS PCP BUT ALSO THE ABILITY FOR OUR PLANT STAFF TO HAVE A AN ANNUAL MAINTENANCE BUDGET TAT ALLOWS THEM TO IF THEY'VE GOT TWENTY FIVE THEY'RE HANDLING UNITS THAT THEY KNOW ARE TWENTY YEARS OLD. AND THEY'RE ALL GOING TO FAIL SOMETIME IN THE VERY NEAR FUTURE BUT THEY DON'T HAVE THE MONEY TO REPLACE THEM. IT BECOMES A DEFERRED MAINTENANCE PROJECT AND WE HOPE WE GET TO THEM BEFORE THEY COMPLETELY FAIL. IF WE'RE ABLE TO FUND THEM ON AND AND AND SAY IN THE NEXT FOUR FIVE YEARS I WILL REPLACE ALL OF THOSE ARE HANDING UNITS WITHIN MY OWN BUDGET AND THEN IT DOES NOT BECOME A DEFERRED MAINTENANCE PROJECT IT BECOMES SOMETHING THEY HANDLE YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT I'M SAYING. YEAH I THINK I THINK -- FOR ME. I WOULD LIKE TO LOOK AT IT IN A COMPREHENSIVE WAY. SO WE ANALYZE HOW HOW MUCH MONEY WE NEED TO SPEND ON AN ANNUAL BASIS. OF RATHER THAN ARBITRARILY SET A NUMBER. I DON'T KNOW IF OTHER PEOPLE AGREE WITH THIS BUT I'M I'M A BIG. MAINTENANCE IS A PLANNING EXERCISE. A BUDGET PLANNING AS A MULTI YEAR BUDGET PLANNING OUR FIRST YOU HAVE TO FIGURE OUT. WHERE THE RIGHT SPOT IS? TO START. TO BECAUSE SAY WHAT WE'RE GONNA LIMóN THEY JUST TO FOR THIS DEFERRED MAINTENANCE BACKLOG AND FIFTEEN YEARS OR TEN YEARS OR AND THEN YOU FIGURE OUT WHAT THAT LINE'S GOING TO BE AND THEN. FIGURE OUT HOW MUCH MONEY YOU'RE YOU HAVE TO SPEND YOU KNOW. OTHERWISE IT'LL JUST KEEP GROWING [inaudible] AND OR KELSO WILL BE AT OUR MEETINGS FOR THE REST OF OUR LIVES RIGHT AND HILL. HE'LL BE HERE FOREVER EVERYBODY'S GOING TO BE SO IN A WELL AT LEAST THROUGH THE RULES ORLEAKING. YEAH LIKE THAT LET YOU KNOW YOUR I'M SAYING SO I I I THINK -- MY GOAL IS TO UPGRADE ALL THE FACILITIES. BUT I NEED TO SEE WHAT THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE PROPER LIBERAL FUNDING AS I I HAD AT A OF THAT COULD BE DONE. IN WORKING WITH THESE COMMITTEES I THINK. WE WOULD TRY TO ACHIEVE THAT. I DON'T KNOW AND WILL RIGHT. THAT'S WHERE WORST THAT'S WHAT I FEEL. RESPONSIBLE THAT I HAVE TO DO. I AM IN TERMS OF LOOKING AT YOUR MAIN ISSUES I HAVE FOR YOUR OUT. WHAT THE PLAN IS TO ELIMINATE THE BACKLOG IN? THIS ONCE YOU ELIMINATE IT ISN'T TRUE THE OPERATING COSTS IN THE ROMANUS POSSIBLY MUCH LESS. IT WOULD BE LESS YOU AVOID EMERGENCY THE TAX EMERGES MONEY RICHES BECAUSE OF THINGS -- FAIL -- I I APPRECIATE AND WILL GO BACK FROM THIS WORKING WITH FINANCE LA WHEN THE COMMITTEE STAFF AND TRY TO COME UP WITH -- SOME INFORMATION REGARDING A SWEET SPOT -- AS WE PUT IT REGARDING TO ONGOING DEFERRED MAINTENANCE FUNDING THE THE OTHER THE OTHER -- IDEA THAT SOME PEOPLE USE WITH MAINTENANCE FIVE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE IS -- A FINANCING IDEAS. HAVE YOU. LOOKED AT FINANCING. N. XCELERATED AND IN USING THE FINANCING TO ACCELERATE. THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE -- PROJECTS SIMILAR TO WHAT YOU'RE DOING WITH THE CAPITAL BUDGET YOU'RE USING REVENUE BONDS. TO EXCEL THE PIXEL RATE SOME OF THE CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT BONDS. PROJECTS -- I WONDER IF -- THE REVENUE BONDS COULD ALSO BE USED TO ACCELERATE SOME OF THE MAINTENANCE -- DEFERRED MAINTENANCE PROJECTS THAT YOU HAVE THERE. ARE YOU HAVE ANY THOUGHTS ON THAT [inaudible] FINANCING OF I'M SORRY NO NO I I NO IMMEDIATE THOUGHTS -- I DON'T KNOW AT SOME POINT WHERE I HAVE A FEW MORE CONVERSATION ABOUT CAPITAL OUTLAY IN US MY CAPITAL OUTLAY COLLEAGUES HERE THAT WORK MORE ON THE LEASE REVENUE SIDE OF THINGS MIGHT HAVE SOME THOUGHTS ON THAT BUT NO IMMEDIATE THOUGHTS ON THAT PARTICULAR. THE YOU KNOW BARTON THIS IT WHAT YEAH GO AHEAD BUDGET JUST IS THAT HAVE -- COMMON AND SPOKEN TO US ABOUT A MODEL SUCH AS THAT AND I THINK THAT -- THOSE ARE ONGOING CONVERSATIONS THAT WE NEED TO HAVE WITHIN THE ADMINISTRATION BECAUSE I IT COMES DOWN TO WHAT THE FUNDING STREAM TO REPAY THOSE BONDS WOULD WOULD BE AND BEING ABLE. TO ACTUALIZE A SAVINGS PER SE FROM GETTING THE MAINTENANCE DONE QUICKER THROUGH FINANCING -- WE WE WE HAVE NOT FOUND THE THE ANSWERS TO THAT YET -- BUT IT'S A I THINK T'S CONVERSATIONS ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO BE ONGOING. THE THE BASIC GOAL OF FINANCING IS TO PROVE THINGS EARLY. SO CLARK CAM LEVER MEETINGS AND THEN -- HAVE THE FACILITIES UPGRADED -- THE PROPER LEVEL AND THEN -- BE ABLE TO ACCOMMODATE THE THE NEEDS OF OUR CALIFORNIA IN TERMS OF INCARCERATION. BUT MEET THE QUALITY STANDARDS THAT WE WANT TO HAVE -- IN AND FALL THE LEGAL RULES. TO DO THAT AND I THINK -- DEFERRED MADE IT SHOULD BE LOOKED AT AS POSSIBILITY -- TO USE THE REVENUE BROUGHT APPROACH -- DOES AND YOU ALSO WOULD SAVE MONEY ON IF YOU LOOK AT IT FROM A TENURE PERSPECTIVE OR WHATEVER YOU MIGHT. FIND IT YOU WOULD SAVE OPERATING COST. AT THE SAME TIME BY NOT HAVING -- CONSTANT REPAIRING AND BROUGHT YOU KNOW CRISIS -- MAINTENANCE PROJECTS THAT YOU HAVE TO DO. ALL THAT ARE THE LAST QUESTION HAMMER I'M SURE WAS. DO YOU ANTICIPATE USING THESE PROGRAMS. TO TRAIN THE WORK FORCE -- PRE APPRENTICESHIP -- TYPE PROGRAM SO WE HAVE. FOR OUR INMATES IN -- FACILITIES IS THIS. HEART OF THESE PROJECTS IS IT INCLUDED IN THE PLANNING OF THE PROJECT. YES ABSOLUTELY CENTER -- THE VAST MAJORITY THESE PER IN THIS PROJECT OVERALL ARE DELIVERED THROUGH OUR INMATE WERE LABOR PROGRAM AND THE CLOSE COORDINATION THAT THEY HAVE WITH THE THE TRADE UNIONS AS FAR AS PRO BRITISH PROGRAMS ARE CONCERNED -- SO THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO LEARN SKILLS FREE PRINTER SHIP SKILLS AND ACTUALLY. HAVE ON THE JOB TRAINING. FOR THE TIME THAT THEY WOULD LEAVE THEY WOULD HAVE A CONSTRUCTION JOB TRAINING. THAT'S THE GOAL OF OUR PROGRAMS IT'S EASIER ACCOMPLISHED ON SOME PRO ON SOME PROJECTS AND OTHER PROJECTS BUT IT'S AN ONGOING CONVERSATION THAT ARE IN MAY OR LABOR PROGRAM IS IS HAVING -- TO RAISES MANY OF THOSE OPPORTUNITIES AS POSSIBLE. OKAY I'M I'M THAT'S THAT'S I I KIND OF FOLLOWED WITH MY POINTS THAT I MAKING ABOUT. PLANNING MAINTENANCE -- A I WAS THINKING ABOUT LAST NIGHT IT'S NOT THAT MUCH DIFFERENT THAN -- ROAD REPAIR MAINTENANCE WHO'S BEEN WORKING ON FOR FIVE YEARS. IT'S KIND OF LIKE YOU EITHER EITHER SPEND MORE LATER OR YOU SPEND LESS MORE EARLIER AND THEN YOU SAVE MONEY LATER. SO I THINK I THINK THERE'S THINGS WE CAN DO WITH THIS -- TO HAVE AN EFFECTIVE PROGRAM AND APPRECIATE YOUR THOUGHTS ON OVER THE NEXT FEW MONTHS [inaudible] YES. A CENTER WELL -- JUST INTEREST TO COUPLE A GENERAL COMMENT ON A FEW SPECIFIC POINTS IN IN RESPONSE TO YOUR TO YOUR COMMENTS I THINK FIRST OF ALL WE CERTAINLY SHARE YOUR INTEREST IN MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE INVESTING ON THE FRONT AND THEN IT DOES ABSOLUTELY. REDUCE OUR COSTS IN THE LONG RUN IF WE ACTUALLY MAINTAIN OUR FACILITIES BEFORE THAT THE POINT WHERE THINGS START BREAKING -- IN SO -- THAT'S ONE POINT I THINK I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO TO MAKE CLEAR THAT IN THAT THERE IS AN ADDITIONAL FUNDING IN ADDITION TO THIS -- TWENTY TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A ONE TIME BASIS DEPARTMENT HAS A BASE BUDGET FOR DEFERRED MASONS THAT'S ABOUT TWENTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY. AND WE CONTINUE -- TO THE BILL THAT INTO THEIR BASE SO THIS SPECIFICALLY FOR REGULAR MAINTENANCE OB AND THAT IS SORT OF DOING THE ARE GOING TO GET INTO IN A MOMENT YES WHICH WILL GET INTO AND SECOND. TO JUST WANTED TO MAKE CLEAR THAT I THINK THAT IS THE IMPORTANT PART OF THIS CONVERSATION -- AND AND THEN ONE OTHER POINT IS THAT IN ADDITION TO THOSE POTS OF MONEY WE'VE INVESTED ATTENDS ACTUALLY OVER A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS OVER THE LAST COUPLE FISCAL YEARS IN A RELEASE AND THEN REPLACING RESEARCH FACILITIES. YEAH AND I THINK I THINK I AGREE WITH WHAT YOU'RE DOING BUT I THINK WE HAVE TO LOOK AT IT. THIS. AGAIN ALL THE STRESSES WE HAVE TO HAVE A STRATEGIC MULTI YEAR APPROACH. WE CAN'T JUST HAVE EVERY YEAR THROWING MORE MONEY AT THINGS WE HAVE TO KNOW. WHAT THE SPOT IS THAT WE NEED TO FIND THE TARGET SO WE CAN? REDUCE THE BACKLOG. SO THAT'S ACTUALLY A PERFECT SEGUE INTO THE M.. I WILL CALL ON YOU CENTER MORE LIKE BUT I JUST WANT TO RAISE THAT. MY PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE HAD YOU PRESENT ON BOTH ITEMS BECAUSE THE CAPITAL OUTLAYS. GOT AS A AN ITEM WHICH IS THE A METHODOLOGY FOR THIS PRISON FUNDING SO WHAT I'M GONNA CALL IN CENTER MORE LIKE FIRST. BUT I ALSO LIKE AYE BERMAN FINANCE SO THROUGH THE CHAIR NEXT TIME WHEN YOU WANT TO RESPOND -- TO SO CENTER MORE LIKE. I'M SURE I WANT TO FOLLOW UP ON YOUR BILL'S COMMENTS -- YOU LEARN AS A YOUNG PERSON. THAT WHAT YOU OWN. OWNS YOU. YOU KNOW I TOLD THE STORY OF BUYING THE SWING SET FOR THE KIDS AND THEN YOUR READ THE INSTRUCTIONS AND IT SAYS EVERY SIX MONTHS YOU HAVE TO OIL THIS GREW THIS BALL. AND YOU JUST YOU KNOW JUST WHATEVER YOU. BY A POOL YOU HAD A BAKER THE POOL IS JUST IN YOU LEARN THESE THINGS. AND THEN THE OLDER YOU BY A YOU BUY A HOME IN A HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION AND YOU START PAYING MONTHLY DUES. AND YOU REALIZE THAT A GOOD CHUNK OF THAT MONEY IS GOING INTO RESERVES TO REPLACE SOMETHING IN THE FUTURE OF THAT IT'S OF ON A CASH BASIS YOU HAVE ACCUMULATED THE FUNDS TO RE ROOF TO REPAINT. TO RESURFACE THE ROTORS -- BUT WE DON'T DO THAT IN GOVERNMENT. WE FORCED BEFORE CITIZENS TO DO THAT. IT BY A HOMEOWNERS -- INTO A HOMER SO SHE BUT WE DON'T DO THAT. AND I'M JUST WONDERING. AS IT AS CENTER VALUES THE TERM MULTI EUROPE ROACH WHEN DO WE GET TO A POINT WHERE YOU SAY OKAY WE'RE GOING TO BUILD A FACILITY IT'S GOING TO COST US. A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS AS A FOR YOUR LIFE THEN OVER THE FORTY YEARS WHERE DO WE THEN ACCUMULATE THE HUNDRED MILLION TO REPLACE IT OR OR RESTORE. AND SO WITH THAT I I'M SEEING. A FAILURE IN BUDGETING. IF WE HAVE TO ISSUE BONDS WE FAILED IF WE'VE GOT TO RAISE A TAX WE FAILED. IT WOULD FILL THE TAXPAYERS BY NOT PREPARING AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN COME TO THEM AND SHAME THEM AND SAYING OUR PRISONS ARE BAD BECAUSE YOU HAVE BEEN CHIP IN AND THEY'RE GOING WAIT A SECOND. AS MAKES SENSE WE'VE BEEN OPEN IN. OUR ENTIRE LIVES HOW DID YOU COME DOES -- WITH A A BOND REQUEST OR A TAX REQUEST SO I'M A LITTLE. DIFFERENT IN MY FINANCIAL APPROACH TO HANDLING THESE THINGS BUT I KIND OF LIKE TO SEE WHEN WE WORRY ABOUT TE BACKLOG WOULD START. BEING PROVED WHATEVER WE BUILD NEW IF YOU BUILD A NEW PRISON I KNOW YOU'RE NOT BUT WHEN YOU DO IN THAT WHICH ARE PUTTING RESERVES ASIDE. AMEDEO IT'S OUR BUILDING A DISCIPLINE SO THAT WE DON'T SIT HERE LOOKING AT A BILLION DOLLAR. BACKLOG. YEAH AND IF SOME OF YOUR ANSWER IS A GERMANE TO YOUR PRESENTATION ON THE MAINTENANCE FUNDING METHODOLOGY. YOU COULD IN [inaudible] YOU MIGHT. ANSWER WHATEVER ISN'T. AND THEN IN YOUR OPENING ADDRESS. WHAT SENATOR MORE LIKE WAS ASKING OKAY? I THINK THAT ARE FUNDING FOR MAINTENANCE IS A IS A COMBINATION OF DIFFERENT FUNDING SOURCES IN A COMBINATIONAL LEVERS AT ALL HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER -- AND AND I THINK THE CHURCH POINT IS VERY WELL TAKEN A LOT OF THE ISSUE OF PUTTING MONEY ASIDE IN ORDER TO KEEP FIXING THINGS. KNOWING THEY'RE GOING TO NEED TO BE FIXED IS -- WHAT ARE? MAINTENANCE -- METHODOLOGY -- PCP IS IS ADDRESSING. YEAH I JUST WANT TO AVOID. WHAT I SEE IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR OVER SOMEONE WAKES UP THE DAY AFTER THANKSGIVING IS HIS -- CHRISTMASES IN A MONTH. WHERE DO I GET MONEY? AS I JUST I JUST DON'T WANT TO BE THERE. THANK YOU THANK YOU MANAGER I'M. LET'S MOVE TO ISSUE FOR PRISON MAINTENANCE FUNDING METHODOLOGY AND AGAIN THERE MAY BE SOME PORTIONS OF THE METHODOLOGY THAT ARE GERMANE. TO THE QUESTION SENATOR MORE LACK HAS ASKED SO. THEY ARE PLEASE PERCENT. ABSOLUTELY MANAGER. FOR APPROXIMATELY TWENTY YEARS -- MAINTENANCE -- FUNDING WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT HAS BEEN INCLUDED IN THE ANNUAL BUDGET ACT BASED ON A PER INMATE FORMULA -- TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY SEVEN DOLLARS PER INMATE -- IN ITS VENN FUND ENOUGH IN THE THE METHODOLOGY USED TO FIND FOOD AND CLOTHING. OR FOR INMATES -- WELL THE COST OF FEEDING AND CLOTHING INMATES IS DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE NUMBER OF INMATES WHO HAVE. THE MAINTENANCE THAT THE SYSTEM NEEDS IS NOT DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE NUMBER OF A INMATES THE SYSTEM HAS AND SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING TO CHANGE WITH THIS -- METHODOLOGY. RISEN MAINTENANCE NEEDS ARE FIXED COSTS THAT ARE TIED PRIMARILY TO THE NUMBER BUILDINGS YOU HAVE THE SIZE AND AGE OF THOSE BUILDINGS THE MECHANICAL ELECTRICAL PLUMBING SYSTEM SERVING THOSE BUILDINGS. AND THEN THE ELECTRICAL AND WATER WASTEWATER SYSTEMS AND AND ROADWAY CYSTS. PARDON THE ROADWAY SYSTEMS SERVING THE ENTIRE -- PRISON CAMPUS -- THE COST OF MAINTAINING THAT HOUSING UNIT OR MEDICAL BUILDING DOES NOT FLUCTUATE IF YOU HAVE A HUNDRED PEOPLE LIVING THAT HOUSING UNIT OR A HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE OR A HUNDRED FIFTY THE MARGINAL CHANGES THERE BUT THE OVERALL MAINTENANCE IT NEEDS TO BE PERFORMED. TO KEEP IT OPERATING STAYS THE SAME. BECAUSE OF THE CHANGES IN THE INMATE POPULATION OVER THE LAST TEN PLUS YEARS THROUGH REALIGNMENT AND THE VARIOUS PROPOSITIONS THAT WERE DISCUSSED IN THE EARLIER A CONVERSATION -- HAVING THIS FUNDED ON A PER INMATE BASIS MEANS THE AMOUNT OF FUNDING AVAILABLE TO PERFORM THESE ONGOING MAINTENANCE FUNCTIONS HAS BEEN REDUCED BY ABOUT 33% -- WENT FROM ABOUT FORTY EIGHT MILLION SEVEN TWO WORDS IT'S ABOUT THIRTY THREE MILLION RIGHT NOW. AND THAT'S FOR A PORTFOLIO ABOUT FORTY TWO MILLION. SQUARE FEET -- SYSTEM WIDE. SO WE HAVE FOR SEVERAL YEARS BEEN WORKING WITH OUR PRISON STAFF AND SERVING THEM TO IDENTIFY WHAT ARE THE COSTS AT YOUR LEVEL -- THAT WE SHOULD BE EXPANDING IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN THE FACILITIES THAT THAT YOU'RE OPERATING -- PART OF THAT WAS LOOKING AT MAKING SURE CONTRACTING MECHANISMS WERE IN PLACE FOR FIRE ALARM FIRE SPRINKLER MAINTENANCE HIGH VOLTAGE EQUIPMENT MAINTENANCE -- NOT ASKING THEM HOW MUCH ARE YOU SPENDING THIS YEAR BECAUSE WE KNOW THEY'RE NOT SPENDING AS MUCH AS SHOULD BE BUT WITH THIS CONTRACTING MECHANISMS IN PLACE WHAT SHOULD WE BE SPENDING -- IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN THE SYSTEMS WHAT DO WE NEED N ORDER TO PAY OUR REGULATORY FEES TO LOCAL AUTHORITIES HAVING JURISDICTION ON AN ANNUAL BASIS. AND TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE PARTS AND EQUIPMENT FOR ONGOING REPLACEMENT OF ITEMS WHEN THEY NEED REPAIR OR WHEN THEY'VE REACHED THE END OF THEIR USEFUL LIFE -- ONE WE'VE GATHERED INFORMATION BY A TO PRISON -- REVIEWED IT BASED ON THE SQUARE FOOTAGE OF EACH PRISON AND LOOKED AT IT ON AN AVERAGE ACROSS -- THE ENTIRE SYSTEM IT CAME OUT TO ABOUT TWO DOLLARS AND TWENTY CENTS PER SQUARE FOOT -- THAT WAS ALSO COMPARED TO SOME EARLY FOR PRISONS BUT FOR THINGS LIKE OFFICE BUILDINGS -- AND TO TWENTY WAS -- CONSISTENT IN THOSE IN THOSE OTHER -- PUBLICATIONS ALSO SO THIS A B. C. P. WAS CALCULATED BASED ON THAT TWO DOLLAR AND TWENTY CENTS PER SQUARE FOOT AGAINST THE FORTY TWO MILLION DOLLAR AYE FORTY TWO MILLION SQUARE FEET -- AREA OF THE OF THE PRISON SYSTEM CURRENTLY. SO EIGHT WITHIN OVER PHASED BASIS OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS IT WOULD TAKE OUR FUNDING FROM THE THIRTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS AT THE CURRENT FORMULA PROVIDES. AN INCREASE AT APPROXIMATELY EIGHTEEN MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR TO EIGHTY NINE MILLION IN TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO AND THEN I'M GOING AT THAT LEVEL -- PLUS THIS PROPOSAL PLACES AT FUNDING IN A SEPARATE BUDGET ITEM IN ORDER TO ASSURE ACCOUNTABILITY -- REGARDING HOW THE FUNDING IS IS SPENT EACH YEAR -- A TIME BACK TO WE WERE DISCUSSING THE KEY HERE IS THAT THIS IS GOING TO ALLOW PRESENCE COME UP WITH A MULTI YEAR PLANS IN ORDER TO BE REPLACING ITEMS. AS THEIR FACING THE AT THE END OF THEIR USEFUL LIFE RATHER THAN LEAVING LARGER SCALE PROJECTS THAT HAVE TO BE SENT TO HEADQUARTERS ON A DEFERRED MAINTENANCE BASIS -- THE EXAMPLE I USED REGARDING YOUR HANDLING UNITS IS IS THE EXAMPLE THAT I I KEEP USING IN HERE THIS WILL ALLOW US TO WORK WITH THE INSTITUTIONS WHICH RIGHT NOW REALLY LOOK AT THEIR MAINTENANCE NEEDS ON A YEAR TO YEAR BASIS WHAT I HAVE TO DO THIS YEAR. ESPECIALLY WHEN THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THEY GET IS SO LIMITED THEY'RE NOT THAT THEY'VE UNFORTUNATELY UNTRAINED FROM VIEWING IT AS OF THE YEAR A MULTI YEAR PROCESS. SO THAT'S ONE OF THE ASPECTS OF THE THREE YEAR IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS IT WILL ALLOW US TO WORK WITH OUR INSTITUTIONS. AND ENSURE THAT WE FUND THESE RIGHT OFF THE BAT -- WITH THE FIRST YEAR AND BEGIN HELPING THEM SET PLANS FOR YOUR TWO THREE AND FULL IMPLEMENTATION TO BEGIN -- READ REPAIRING THEIR ITEMS AND REPLACING THINGS BEFORE THEY BECOME A LARGE SCALE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE PROJECT -- YOU SEE THERE'S ANYTHING I pTHE CORRELATION IS. THIS IS TWO ITEMS TO KEEP JUMPING BACK AND FORTH -- PART OF LOOKING FOR THAT SWEET SPOT UNDER FOR MAINTENANCE IS ALSO HELPING TO RAMP THIS UP AND GETTING THIS IN PLACE THIS OVER TIME ONCE IT'S FULLY IMPLEMENTED AND AND WE SEE IT GOING FORWARD FIVE YEARS FROM THERE. WE BELIEVE WILL CERTAINLY REDUCE THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE LIST AND SO IF WE IT'S A COMBINATION OF FIGURING OUT WHAT. REDUCTIONS WILL WE SEE FROM THAT AND THEN IF WE ARE GOING TO INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF MONEY WE SPEND EACH YEAR ON DEFERRED MAINTENANCE IN ORDER. TO FULLY ADDRESS THE BACKLOG -- WE WOULD WANNA MAKE THAT DECISION BASED ON THE BILLION DOLLARS BECAUSE WE BELIEVE GOING FORWARD AFTER FULL IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS. THAT BILLION DOLLARS WILL FALL ON THE NATURAL SO IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S GONNA REQUIRE ONGOING STUDY AND AND CONSULTATION TO FIND THAT FIND THAT SWEET SPOT BUT WE REALLY. REALLY BELIEVE THAT THIS WILL HAVE POSITIVE -- EFFECTS GOING FORWARD THAT WILL -- PROVIDE THE PRISONS -- AS THE TYPES OF SPACES THEY NEED TO BE IN ORDER TO PROVIDE THE REHABILITATIVE. PROGRAMS AND ALL THE OTHER PROGRAMS THAT HAVE BEEN ALREADY DISCUSSED HERE TODAY THIS IS. THIS IS GOOD. IT BE NICE TO SEE IF YOU WANTED TO LOOK AT MAYBE YOU WANT TO SEE THE FULL PICTURE. HI WHERE YOU'RE GONE MAYBE A LITTLE LONGER TIMELINE. THREE YEARS I GOOD THOUGH I THINK YOU SHOULD LOOK AT MAYBE -- LONGER TIMELINE TO SEE -- HOW YOUR I DON'T I DON'T LIKE WHEN SOMEBODY SAYS ON THE NATURAL OR WANT TO SEE THE ACTUAL? NOT THE NATURAL. SO -- TIME AT THE PLANT YOU KNOW A LIKE A MORE. FIND OUT THINGS TO YOU CAN SEE HOW THE THE BACKLOG GETS REDUCE AND IN YOUR I KNOW YOU'RE YOU'RE YOU'RE. SPENDING A LITTLE MORE EVERY YEAR AND FINALLY YOU REACH THAT'S BOB WEIR. WHERE YOU'RE A? BOB GOES AWAY. AND TALK ABOUT CAPITAL LA NEXT. COUPLE LA SHOULD. GIVEN THE FACT WE HAVE A BILLION DOLLAR AND IT'S BACK I THINK THE CAPITAL L. IS. I'LL BE A STRONGLY. REHABILITATION OR THE CAPITAL OUTLAY PROGRAM HAS TO BE VERY INTO SB. WE DON'T WANT A LOT OF NEW. ONE FOCUS ON THE CAPITAL AT THE COUNTER I WAS ON THE THE REHAB PART OF OUR OUR BUDGET. SO I I I I APPRECIATE ALL THE WORK YOU DID NUTS. I AM INTERESTED IN REFINING IT A LITTLE BIT LIKE. I UNDERSTAND THAT THE ONE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR CAPITAL. INVESTMENTS ARE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES ARE ORIENTED TOWARDS THE PRIORITIES -- FOCUS THAT WE HAVE SO -- BEFORE IF I'M IN A LET. I WANT TO GO TO THE VARIOUS CAPITAL OUTLAY DISCUSSION AND THEN SEE WHETHER -- FINANCE OR LA -- HAS ANYTHING MORE TO ADD -- BUT IN THE IN RECEIVING THE BREAK DOWN THAT -- SENATOR BILL DESCRIBED. YOU BYE SO IT MUST BE. RIGHT FACILITY ALSO IS CLEARLY WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE. SOME FACILITIES THAT ARE IN FAR GREATER. NEED IN HEART BIGGER DISREPAIR THAN OTHERS AND WE MAY WANT TO LOOK AGAIN AT THE ISSUE OF THE COST EFFECTIVENESS OF INVESTMENTS IN FACILITY THE OKAY IF YOU MADE THE BOTTOM. EXACTLY. I'M YOU MAY PROCEED ON ISSUE. FIVE OKAY CERTAINLY AND OUT OF HIM TO GIVE A OVERVIEW RATHER GOING INTO ANY DEPTH ON ANY ONE OF THE PROPOSALS OF COURSE WITH OUR QUESTIONS -- WE CAN GO MORE IN DEPTH -- ON ANY OF THE PROPOSALS -- SO THE CAPITAL OUTLAY OF ITEM FOR ITEM -- FIVE CONTAINS OF APPROXIMATELY -- THIRTEEN NEW -- APPROPRIATIONS APPROXIMATELY SEVENTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS -- AND THREE RE APPROPRIATIONS FROM PRIOR YEARS THAT TOTALS APPROXIMATELY SIXTEEN MILLION DOLLARS. OF THAT SEVENTY MILLION A LARGE PART OF THAT HAS TO DO WITH -- HEALTHCARE FACILITIES -- AT FOR PRISONS SO -- LAST YEAR'S BUDGET CYCLE FOR ADDITIONAL LEASE REVENUE FUNDING FOR THE HEALTH CARE FACILITY IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM WE LOOK BACK AT THE EXISTING HEALTH CARE FACILITY IMPROVEMENT PROJECTS. AND TO IDENTIFY WHICH ONES -- WE WERE LOOKING TO MANAGE OUR RISK AS FAR AS INCREASED COST INCREASE SCHEDULES ON THOSE PROJECTS. AD THROUGH THAT ANALYSIS WERE IDENTIFIED OF FOUR SEPARATE PRISONS -- PROJECTS OF FOUR SEPARATE PRISONS THAT EITHER HAD POOR PERFORMING CONTRACTORS -- AND THERE ANY CONSULTANTS -- EQUALLY MIGHT BE POOR -- IN AND HAD PROJECTS THAT HADN'T STARTED YET THAT WE'RE GONNA BE RENOVATIONS AND BUILDINGS THAT WERE ABOUT FIFTY FIVE TO SIXTY FIVE YEARS OLD -- OUR EXPERIENCE -- TO THIS POINT TIME HAS -- AND LET US TO RECOGNIZE THAT WE'RE GOING INTO THESE BUILDINGS THAT ARE THAT OLD WE FIND A LOT OF ON ANTICIPATED SITE CONDITIONS THAT DRIVE ADDITIONAL COSTS -- ESPECIALLY WHEN WE HAVE GENERAL CONTRACTORS DO CONSTRUCTION BULLETINS AND AND NEW DESIGN FEATURES FROM THE ANY FIRMS -- SO -- WE MADE THE DECISION TO IN ORDER TO GET THE LEAST REVENUE FUNDING TO GO FARTHER WITH THE OTHER REMAINDER OF THE HEALTH CARE PROJECTS WE PULL FOR PROJECTS OUT AT THESE FOR PRISONS AND PROPOSE THEM THROUGH THE BUDGET ACT AT TO BE DONE AS A COMPLETELY SEPARATE PROJECT WOULD. NO LONGER BE -- DRAIN ON ANYWAY ON THE LEASE REVENUE FUNDING FOR THE REMAINDER OF IT AND WE PLAN TO HAVE THE WORK DONE BY THE INMATE WARD LABOR PROGRAM -- BEYOND THE ASPECTS OF THE THAT PRINTER SHIP IN THE JOB TRAINING TO THAT WE HAVE A BETTER ABILITY UNDER THE HECK A PROGRAM TO CONTROL OUR COSTS WHEN WE'RE USING THE IN MAY OR LABOR PROGRAM RATHER THAN A GENERAL CONTRACTOR. IF WE DO RUN INTO DELAYS WE DON'T FACE EXTENDED JOB COST THAT WE DO WITH GENERAL CONTRACTORS AND OUR INMATE WERE LABOR PROGRAM HAS A MUCH BETTER RELATIONSHIP LOCAL PRISON STAFF. AND CAN MANAGE THE DISRUPTIONS THAT COME FROM THESE PROJECTS -- BECAUSE MANY OF THESE ARE IN THE CENTRAL HEALTH SERVICES BUILDING AT THESE AT THESE PRESENCE. BEYOND THE FOR HEALTH CARE PROJECTS IN HERE -- WE HAVE ADDITIONAL A CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS AT A NUMBER OF LOCATIONS -- PELICANS A PELICAN BAY STATE PRISON -- FACILITY D. WAS -- PART OF THE FOR THERE THAT WAS -- CHANGED INTO A GENERAL POPULATION UNIT AND THIS IS IN ORDER -- TO CONSTRUCT A STANDARD -- YARD FOR THEM -- TO RECREATION -- ANOTHER PROJECT IS AT THE CORRECTION TRAINING FACILITY AND SOLD AND MINISTRY OF SEGREGATION CELL DOOR RETROFIT TO IMPROVE -- SAFETY -- FOR THE INMATES AND TAFF THIS IS SIMILAR TO A PROJECT THAT WE JUST -- WE'RE WE'RE JUST COMPLETING RIGHT NOW AT DUAL VOCATIONAL INSTITUTION THAT WAS A SUCTION TYPE [inaudible] OF ROGER CAN THEREFORE ADDITIONAL WATER STORAGE TANKS AT FOLSOM THAT WOULD SERVE BOTH FOLSOM STATE PRISON AND CALIFORNIA STATE PRISON SACRAMENTO -- THIS IS NEEDED TO ADDRESS A FIRE LIFE SAFETY REQUIREMENTS THAT -- WERE IDENTIFIED IN THESE PRISONS -- THROUGH THE STATE FIRE MARSHAL AND THE HEALTH CARE CONSTRUCTION WE DON'T NEED TO GO THROUGH EACH ONE OF THESE SINCE WE HAVE IT BEFORE US I MEAN WE OBVIOUSLY MAY HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT THEM. BUT RATHER THAN YOU'RE LITERALLY READING TO US I MEAN AND I DON'T MEAN IT THIS IS NOT -- BUT RATHER THE OVERVIEW IS WHAT WOULD I THINK RIGHT NOW BE MORE HOPEFUL AND THEN WE MAY HAVE SPECIFIC QUESTIONS BUT ANY ONE PARTICULAR. PROPOSAL OUR FACILITY. OKAY LET ME I WILL TRY TO TRY TO SUMMIT AND IS BRIEF BE AS BRIEF AS POSSIBLE -- THE BUDGET DOES INCLUDE FOR PROJECTS THAT ARE REQUESTING THE SECOND PHASE OF FUNDING SO THESE ARE PROJECTS THAT WERE IN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET FOR THE PRELIMINARY PLAN PAYS AND WE'RE NOT REQUESTING TO MOVE ON TO THE WORKING DRAWING PHASE -- THE BUDGET REQUEST DOES INCLUDE ONE BRAND NEW PROJECT -- THIS IS -- IT ALLEN ADAM VALLEY STATE PRISON NEAR MADERA -- WE HAVE A WATER SYSTEM THEY'RE SERVING BOTH VALLEY STATE PRISON AND CENTRAL CALIFORNIA WOMEN'S FACILITY ACROSS THE STREET -- ARSENIC IN THE GROUNDWATER IS ENDEMIC IN MANY OTHER AREAS OF THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND WE HAVE FIVE WELLS SERVING THESE TWO PER ENDING. THE WELL WATER -- BECAUSE SOME WELLS ARE BETTER THAN OTHERS IN ORDER TO MEET ARSENIC STANDARDS BUT THE ARSENIC LEVELS ARE RISING SO THE LONG TERM SOLUTION TO MAINTAIN STANDARDS THERE IS GOING TO BE -- TO BUILD AN ARSENIC TREATMENT PLANT TO SERVE BOTH PRISONS -- AND THEN -- JUST VERY BRIEFLY THERE ARE -- TWO REVERBERATIONS -- ONE HAS TO DO WITH THE A. B. NINE HUNDRED I'M SORRY THERE THREE REVERBERATIONS ONE IS -- TO GO TO CONSTRUCTION ON A NEW BOILER FACILITY AT DAHLE LOCATIONAL INSTITUTION -- FIRE MARSHAL APPROVAL OF THE DRAWINGS CAME AFTER THE END OF THE FISCAL YEAR THIS WEEK WE COULD NOT USE THE FUNDING FROM THE PREVIOUS BUDGET. ARE THE EVEN A HUNDRED GENERAL FUND OF CORPORATION IS A FUNDING SOURCE FOR US SEVEN ON GOING PROJECTS ARE IN CONSTRUCTION NOW AND SO -- PROJECTED COMPLETION DATES FOR THOSE PROJECTS IS AN TWENTY TWENTIES OR ASKING TO HAVE THAT FUNDING REPROGRAMMED IT SO WE CAN COMPLETE THOSE PROJECTS -- AND THEN FINALLY THERE'S THE STUDY OF THE ORIGINAL TWELVE PRISONS -- AND REALIZES THAT THIS PRESENT PROJECT HAS BEEN MUCH DELAYED IN AS A SOURCE OF MUCH FRUSTRATION -- WITH OUR RELATIONSHIP -- WITH WITH THE LEGISLATURE -- WE DO BELIEVE THAT WE ARE ARE ON THE RIGHT TRACK TO GETTING COMPLETED NOW WE SPEND SIGNIFICANT EFFORTS IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN TO FINALIZE A FORMAT -- WITH THE CONSOLE UTILIZED AND TO CORRECT -- DEFICIENCIES AND HOW THE OR NATIONAL REPORTS WERE COMING IN -- WE NOW BEEN ABLE TO RECEIVE -- FOR DRAFT REPORTS -- SO THERE'S EIGHT MORE TO GO YOU HAVE REPORT LEASE -- LATER THIS CALENDAR YEAR -- SO WE'RE REQUESTING EXTENSION OF THE LIQUIDATION PERIOD TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN -- FINALIZE THE INVOICES AND AND PAY ALL THE BILLS OVER THE CONSOLE -- BY THE END OF NEXT FISCAL YEAR -- BILLABLE ANSWERING QUESTIONS CURRENTLY I'M. THIS EITHER DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE REALLY -- HAVE A COMMENT ON THIS BEFORE A GIVE ME COMMENTS FROM MY QUESTIONS FOR MY COLLEAGUES. GO AHEAD SENATOR MORE LIKE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR -- LEASE REVENUE BONDS -- WHERE ARE WE? ARE WE GONNA DO THAT JUST HELP ME OUT ARE WE ARE WE PAYING RENT. THE STATE PAYING RENTS RIGHT NOW FOR EVERY. PRISON AND YOU'RE USING THAT INCOME AS THE THE CASH FLOW OUGHT WELL ARE ARE PROJECTS IN FRONT OF HERE IN THIS BUDGET REQUEST NONE OF THEM ARE RELYING UPON LEASE REVENUE BONDS. OKAY SO. WHAT HAVE I GOT HERE WHAT WHY DID THEY LEASE REVENUE BONDS? FOR IS THE FIRST. THREE I'M IN A GUEST BONE. WHAT A WHAT AM I MISSING I'M? SO THAT RELATES TO THE PROJECTS THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY REVIEWS OTHER HEALTH CARE -- HEALTH CARE. FACILITY IMPROVEMENT PROJECT TAKE THE PROJECT THE CARVED OUT OF THE SCOPE OF THE PREVIOUS PROJECT WE'RE PUTTING FORWARD AS INDIVIDUAL PROJECTS SO THOSE PREVIOUS PROJECTS WERE -- WERE WERE WERE FUNDED THROUGH LEASE REVENUE BONDS. AND AND WE'RE HERE FOR ME IS PREVIOUS TO THANK YOU. FOR POINTING THAT OUT. BECAUSE I WOULD OR MAYBE JUST FOR MY BENEFIT -- WHAT WHAT WAS THE LINK TO THE BOND SOMEBODY? TO MATURITY THERE THERE ARE VARYING L&lt;c.cyan&gt;G SAID&lt;/c&gt; GENERALLY IT THIRTY YEARS -- IF OR TO TWENTY FIVE TWENTY FIVE THIRTY YEARS AT IT VARIES DUE TO MARKET CONDITIONS AT THE TIME THAT THE IN THE YOU KNOW TREASURES -- OFFICE DECISIONS WHEN THAT GOES TO MARKET. WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE TIME I PAYING DOUBLED IN THE INTEREST COSTS RATE OVER THE LIFE OF THE THIRTY YEARS. THAT THERE BEEN VER STUDIES ON A BUTTON WITHIN WE SHOULDN'T QUIBBLE ON WHETHER IT'S FULL DOUBLE OR NOT YES. ROUGHLY IT'S THE A TOTAL INTEREST COSTS ON EACH OF THESE. YOU KNOW YOU WON'T HAVE THAT WITH THE DAY BUT AGAIN JUST TRYING. TO PRUDENT WITHOUT WE SPEND MONEY. THAT ARE MORE LIKE OLD ALLOW DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TO ADD ON AND OF COURSE YOU MAY TWO BY THE DEPARTMENT FINANCE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR CRANE ONE ROBIN HARSH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AT CURRENTLY RIGHT NOW IT'S ABOUT ONE POINT SIX TIMES OF THE SOUL THE BOND FOR HUNDRED DOLLARS WOULD BE A HUNDRED AND SIXTY DOLLARS THAT WOULD PAY BACK OVER TWENTY FIVE YEARS. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. YEAH ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS. YOU DID IT OKAY -- GREAT OKAY. CENTER BILL -- WE DID -- THIS CAN YOU EXPLAIN MORE DETAILS ABOUT THE THE PRISON WATER STORAGE TANKS. WHAT IS THE PROJECT? SO THE FIRE CODE AS I LIKE WATER OR THE WATER TANKS IS. SIXTY TWO WELL THEY I THINK THE SIXTY SIX MILLION WAS THE PRICE OF THE OVERALL HEALTH CARE FACILITY IMPROVEMENT -- PROJECT THERE THE AND FOR THE WATER TANKS IS NINE POINT SIX MILLION. THE THE TOTAL COST OF THE WAR. NINE NINE ONE SIX NINETY NINE POINT ACT. THE WHAT WHAT THE GORE WIRING. OKAY -- THE THE IF IT'S THE FOR THE FIRE CODE REQUIREMENTS -- FOR THE FIRE FLOW NECESSARY BASED UPON THE SIZE OF THE BUILDINGS AND WHETHER THE BUILDINGS ARE SPRINKLED OR NOT. THIS IS ONE OF THE DIFFICULTIES WE RAN INTO IN IMPLEMENTING HEALTH CARE FACILITY IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM IS THAT WE ARE GOING INTO MANY PRISONS THAT HAD BUILT IN PREVIOUS YEARS AND THE CODES MAY HAVE CHANGED SINCE THEN SO AS WE WERE IN. THE BUILDING -- VARIETY OF NEW BUILDINGS AND RENOVATIONS AND COLLEGES BUT CAN WE BE SPECIFIC TO THE FOR SOME WATER TANKS. SO WHEN WE ARE BUILDING THE GUM THE BUILDINGS IN THE RENOVATIONS AT C. S. P. SACRAMENTO IN FOLSOM STATE PRISON -- THE FIRE MARSHAL IN REVIEWING THE PLANS IDENTIFIED THAT THE FIRE FLOW REQUIREMENTS NEEDED TO BE MET AND THE WAY THE FIRE FLOW REQUIREMENTS ARE MEASURED IS BASED UPON THE LARGEST SPRINKLER BUILDING. EVEN THOUGH OUR PROJECT WAS NOT BUILDING THAT SMALLER BUILDINGS BUT THEY WATER STORAGE REQUIREMENT FOR SPRINKLERS WAS BASED ON THE LARGEST BUILDING WHICH IS -- WAREHOUSE OF A QUITE SOME SIZE AT ALL AT THIS IS THE SACRAMENTO. SO THAT'S THE REASON WHY THE TANK SEVENTY BUILDERS BECAUSE THE FIRE MARSHAL IDENTIFIED A DEFICIENCY IN THE EXISTING FACILITY AS FAR AS THE STORAGE REQUIREMENT FOR FIRE WATER. SO HE WANTS A STORAGE FACILITY AS OPPOSED -- TO OUR FARM WATER -- FLIGHTS WERE FROM -- WATERS [inaudible] SUPPORT SYSTEM. WE HAVE TO BUILD IT. IT IS A REASON WHY IS REQUIRING. IT IT HAS. TO IT THAT'S A QUESTION IT HAD IT HAS TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE A A A SPECIFIC AMOUNT OF FLOW FOR A SPECIFIC AMOUNT OF TIME AT A SPECIFIC -- GALLONS PER MINUTE AND THE EXISTING WATER SERVICE IN FROM THE MUNICIPALITY BUT NOT BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THAT EVEN IF IT WAS SOLELY DEDICATED JUST -- TO JUST TO FIGHTING THAT FIRE. OUR WATER CHANGE. AND A CERTAIN NUMBER. THE WATER PRESSURE THE YES I THINK I AM DOING WITHOUT PULLING OUT THE DOCUMENT I THINK SOME LIKE FOUR THOUSAND GALLONS PER MINUTE -- OVER THE COURSE OF OF TWO HOURS OR THREE HOURS. AND TIMES A SQUARE FOOT YEAH. DON'T HAVE A WELDER. NO WE'RE ON MUNICIPAL WATER THERE AND IN THERE THEY ALSO REQUIRE -- THE PROJECT TO SHOW HOW THAT WATER IS MAINTAINED AT ALL TIMES SO IF YOU HAVE A TANK AND YOU HAVE A DAILY FLUCTUATION OF YOUR WATER USAGE YOU NEED TO BE ABLE TO SHOW HOW THAT DAILY FLUCTUATION STILL. ALWAYS LEAVES THEIR FIRE REQUIRE THE CODE REQUIRED AMOUNT IN. WHAT YOU JUST DESCRIBED? WAS NOT TANKS. THAT ARE NECESSARY FOR DAILY WATER USAGE YOU JUST DESCRIBED TANKS THAT HAD TO BE NECESSARY FOR THE SHOW YES BUT BECAUSE THEY HAVE ANY NOT YELLOW. THERE ARE NOW THAT COVERS OUR DAILY WATER USAGE BUT RIGHT NOBODY HAS OCCURRED. YOU ARE BUILDING NEW TANK. FOR THIS PURPOSE WHAT THE NINE MILLION IS YES SO WHY WOULD THEY NEED NEED TO BE. I THANKS THAT WOULD ALSO SUPPLY FOR THE DAILY WATER USED. I APOLOGIZE I MISSTATED A MANAGER A WHERE WAS SAYING IS A REASON WE'RE BUILDING NEW TAXES BECAUSE OUR EXISTING TANK DOES NOT ALLOW FOR THE CAPACITY THE NECESSARY WITH THE DAILY HAS OF THE DAILY WITH RIGHT BECAUSE OF THE DAILY USAGE THESE NEW TANKS OR JUST TO COVER THE FIRE. FLOW REQUIREMENTS. IN WAS THERE ANY DISCUSSION WITH THE FIRE MARSHALL AS TO HOW THERE MIGHT BE. ACCOMMODATION FOR THE WAREHOUSE. SEPARATELY FROM THE CUSTODIAL FACILITY. OF WE ARE PRESENT HAVE NOT BEEN BUILT WITH SEPARATE FIRE FLOW -- A FIVE FIGHT ESSENTIALLY ONE SINGLE WATER SYSTEM THAT'S OUR THAT THAT THAT'S THE OBVIOUSLY AND THAT'S WHY YOU'RE BUILDING NEW BUT STILL YOU ARE CLEARLY CONNECTING THESE WATER TAKES SO. DID YOU CONSIDER AND ENTERTAIN A A SEPARATE SOURCE. FOR THE WAREHOUSE VISIT YOU'VE DESCRIBED THAT YOU MUST HAVE THIS LARGER ARE LARGER ASK BECAUSE OF THE SQUARE FOOTAGE WAREHOUSE FACILITY. WHICH YES WILL HAVE PEOPLE BUT NOT LIKE. THE LADY TWENTY FOUR SEVEN SO WAS THERE. ANY NEGOTIATIONS WITH FIRE MARSHAL AROUND. SOME DIFFERENTIATION HERE THAT MIGHT THEN REDUCE OUR COSTS. I I UNDERSTAND YOUR QUESTION AND I DON'T HAVE THE DETAILS IN FRONT OF ME AT THIS TIME SO I'LL GO BACK AND AND RESEARCH THAT WITH THE PROJECT TEAM AND QUE. RESPOND BACK THROUGH THE CONCERT. IS I MEAN CLEARLY WHAT YOU DESCRIBED AS A THE WATER TANKS -- BECAUSE I'M LOOKING AT NINE MILLION FOR SOME WATER TANKS AND I'M THINKING. THOSE ARE PRETTY CADILLAC BUT DEPENDING ON THE CAPACITY MAYBE NOT BUT THEN AGAIN MAYBE THE CAPACITY DOESN'T HAVE TO BE QUITE. CERTAINLY WE NEED TO ACHIEVE THE OBJECTIVE OF THE FIRE MARSHAL BUT MAYBE THERE'S OTHER WAYS TO ACHIEVE IT. I'M UNDERSTOOD WHEN WE GO BACK AND RESEARCH THAT AND WE WILL UP RIGHT INFORMATION BACK TO THE COMMITTEE. SENATOR BELT BACK TO YOU OF SODA YES. IS -- FOR FOR AND YES [inaudible] SO WHAT [inaudible] CERTAINLY. SO. ONE ONE IT'S A IT'S A IT'S A A THREE TIER HOUSING UNIT USED AGAIN FOR ADMINISTRATIVE SEGREGATION AND IT HAS OPENED BARRED CELL FRONTS SO THE ABILITY. AND YOU KNOW TO THE YOU THE ABILITY -- TO EITHER PUT -- STAFF OR IN IN MAY THAT MAY BE ESCORTING PASS ANOTHER INMATE CELL AND RISK IS VERY VERY MUCH A IN AT RISK -- FOR ANY SORT OF ATTACKS WHILE YOU'RE WALKING PAST -- THE THE LONG TEAR SO IN ORDER TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM HERE AND IT AT OTHER PRISONS -- WE REPLACE THE BARD CELL FRONT WITH SALAS ALL FRONTS -- IT INCLUDES -- ADDITIONAL VISION PANELS -- AND THE VENTILATION SYSTEM THE SERVICE OF THE THIS THE CELLS BECAUSE RIGHT NOW IT'S BASED UPON AIR FLOW THROUGH THE BARS AND FORCE WHEN YOU PUT THE SOLID OR THERE YOU'VE GOT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE GETTING THE PROPER AIR FLOW THROUGH. US ALSO AGREED THE BUILDING -- TO INCLUDE -- FIRE ALARM A FIRE SPRINKLERS WHICH MAY NOT WE'RE NOT CODE REQUIRED AT THE TIME THE BUILDING WAS. ORIGINALLY CONSTRUCTED BUT IS REQUIRED TO THE LEVEL OF RENOVATION WILL BE DOING IN THIS ROOM. IN THE WORLD. NOT A CONDITION BUT BUT BUT EVAPORATIVE COOLING -- YES VILLAGE. OUR FIRE ALARM FIRE SPRINKLER UPGRADES [inaudible] I INDEED. ONE I AM I FEAR THAT ANY COMPARISON WOULD BE APPLES AND ORANGES BECAUSE THAT NEW CELL WOULD BE BUILDING BUILDING THAT GOES ALONG WITH IT -- SO I HAVEN'T DONE THE MATH ON THIS ONE WE NEVER LOOKED AT IT ON A ON A PER CELL. PURCELL COST. I'M NOT MORE MONEY BUT INCLUDING IN SCOPE I BELIEVE THE LIGHTING FIXTURES ARE BEING ARE ARE BEING REPLACED AT THE SAME TIME ALSO -- YEAH. BUT NO WE'RE NOT REPLACING THE BUNKER NOT REPLACING THE YES WELL IT'S IT'S TO READ IT'S TO CREATE A S. A SAFER WORKING ENVIRONMENT YET [inaudible] GOOD WORK [inaudible] CERTAINLY I I I OF THE STATE. OF YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY. ONE CENTER MORE LIKELY TO ONE OKAY. I'M. AND I WOULD ONLY REYES. IT -- TO COMPLY COLLEAGUES SENATOR BILLS CONCERNS OR COMMENTS BUT ON THE ON THE ISSUE OF AND IF THIS DOESN'T NECESSARILY NEED TO COMMENT BUT WE DID APPROVED LAST YEAR -- RE PURPOSING SOME YARDS AT PELICAN BAY [inaudible] GIVEN -- OUR INTENT -- TO BRING POPULATION OUT OF STATE INTO STATE AND KEEPING OUR POPULATION NUMBERS DOWN IN THE OTHER THE LADIES THAT ARE PASSED OR CLOSE TO THEIR CAP I'M. BUT IN CONTEXT OF OUR DISCUSSION EARLIER. AROUND OUR REQUIREMENT TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE PROVIDING. THE APPROPRIATE. AND CONSISTENT OR COMPARABLE REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMS IN ALL OF OUR YARDS IN ALL OF OUR FACILITIES. AND HOW SOME LEVEL OF THOSE ARE DEPENDENT ON COMMUNITY MOMENT VOLUNTEERS AND SUCH. WHEN WE LOOK AT FACILITIES LIKE PELICAN BAY? THAT ARE VERY REMOTE AND NOT NEAR POPULATION CENTERS WE ALSO KNOW THAT OUR ABILITY. TO SUCCEED IN THOSE ASPECTS. OF IS DIFFICULT IS HARDER. AND SO I HAVE TO LOOK AT AS WE THINK ABOUT IT COMMITTING EXPENDITURES OF FUNDS. WHETHER WE AND AGAIN AS WE LOOK AT WHERE WE'RE GOING TO PUT POPULATION IN WE WE PUTTING POPULATION. AT FACILITIES WHERE WE KNOW WE CAN. PROVIDE THE ADEQUATE REHAB BECAUSE WE HAVE ACCESS TO EITHER THE EDUCATIONAL. INSTITUTIONS OR OTHER AND I'M NOT TALKING JUST VOLUNTEERED WE HAVE THAT PRO PROPER -- ACCESS WHICH WE MAY NOT IN SOME OF THE REMOTE FACILITIES SO AGAIN DOESN'T REQUIRE COMMENT BUT IT'S CERTAINLY A LENS THAT I'M GONNA BE LOOKING AT IN OUR EXPENDITURES. THROUGHOUT OUR BETTING OF CDC OURS BUDGET. JUST SO GO AHEAD CENTERVILLE. KIND OF CURIOUS OF WHICH THE SAUDIS HAVE BEEN WORSE MAINTENANCE BACKLOG. IN TERMS OF ANALYZING THESE REQUEST. YEAH YOU CAN GET. THAT DATA -- I DON'T KNOW GIVE IT TO US. RIGHT RATHER THAN. FIND WORSE YEAH JUST GIVE US. MAYBE OUTLINED WITH THE PROBLEMS OR ERRORS. THE SOUL IS THAT HAVE -- WORST. OKAY BUT YES OR NO GREAT. OKAY SO NOW PUBLIC COMMENT. ON THESE ITEMS THIS IS ISSUE THREE FOUR FIVE ANY PUBLIC COMMENT. OKAY WE WILL NOW MOVE TO ITEM THESE -- ALL RIGHT SO -- APOLOGIES I DID NOT ACTUALLY. MR CLOSER WE ARE YOU PREPARED NOW YOU HAVE THE OTHER STAFF OR DO YOU WANT ME -- TO JEEZ I'M FINE OKAY GREAT BECAUSE WE WERE HAD WE I SUPPOSE GOTTEN TO YOUR ITEM EARLIER WE MIGHT NOT HAVE HAD YOUR STAFF PRESENT I'M HAPPY TO DO IS. FIRST IF THAT'S IF THAT NO I THINK. I THINK I CAN ADEQUATE OF MY STAFF. YES WE'RE GOOD. ALL RIGHT THEN WE WILL -- PROCEED WITHISSUE SIX WHICH IS AN OVERVIEW OF OUR IN MADE HEALTH CARE AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES BY A RECEIVER. ON PARK ALSO. RECEIVED THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF MY NAME IS CLARK KELSO I AM THE RECEIVER APPOINTED BY THE FEDERAL COURT IN THE PLOTS OF LITGATION. A WITH RESPONSIBILITY FOR CDC OURS MEDICAL PROGRAM I HAD JUST NOTICED -- IN REVIEWING OF THE THE AGENDA. OF THAT I'M LISTED AS TALKING ABOUT THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. AND THAT ACTUALLY IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF SOMEONE ELSE. MY RESPONSIBILITY IN THE PLOT LITIGATION IS LIMITED TO MEDICAL -- I WON'T BE SPEAKING TO MENTAL HEALTH IF YOU WANT TO REPORT FROM THAT YOU SHOULD. DISCUSS THAT WITH -- DIANA TOSH. THANK YOU APPRECIATE THAT CLARIFICATION. I'M OVERALL -- WELL FIRST I WOULD LIKE TO AMBER A AND JUST A FEW ADDITIONAL DETAILS TO THE BACKGROUND THAT'S ALREADY PROVIDED TO SUBCOMMITTEE MEMBERS IN YOUR AGENDA. I WHICH DOES -- DESCRIBE THE HISTORY AND BACKGROUND OF OF THE BOTTLE LITIGATION. OVERALL. WE CONTINUE TO MAKE STEADY PROGRESS IN FILLINGOUR MISSION. BY IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF MEDICAL CARE THAT IS BEING DELIVERED TO OUR PATIENTS AND ON AN INSTITUTION BY INSTITUTION BASIS. TRANSFERRING AUTHORITY OVER THE MEDICAL PROGRAM BACK TO THE STATE. AS OF TODAY. UP TWENTY FOUR OF CDC OURS THIRTY FIVE INSTITUTIONS ABOUT HAVE EITHER BEEN DELEGATED BACK TO CDC ARE FOR ITS MANAGEMENT. FOR RECEIVED A FINDING OF ACCEPTABLE CARE FROM THE OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL. OF SPECIFICALLY NINETEEN INSTITUTIONS HAVE BEEN DELEGATED THERE ARE FIVE ADDITIONAL INSTITUTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN RATED BY -- Y. G. AS ADEQUATE. BUT I HAVE NOT YET DELEGATED. I'M THAT LEAVES US WITH ELEVEN REMAINING INSTITUTIONS -- THAT HAVE NOT BEEN DELEGATED BACK TO THE STATE AND DO NOT HAVE A FINDING OF ADEQUATE CARE. IN THOSE INSTITUTIONS ARE NOW -- ONE OF MY MOST THE PRIMARY FOCUSES. I BELIEVE THAT A FEW OF THESE ELEVEN WILL FAIRLY EASILY BE FOUND ADEQUATE IN THE NEXT ROUND OF REVIEWS BY THE OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL. AND WILL BE SUITABLE FOR DELEGATION BACK TO THE STATE. THAT WILL LEAVE US WITH A SMALL BUT STILL SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE FRANKLY. SOME OF THE MOST DIFFICULT TO MANAGE INSTITUTIONS. IN THE STATE. WELL THAT WOULD PROBABLY BE MORE LIKE. EIGHT I CAN ASSURE THE SUBCOMMITTEE THAT WE ARE DOING EVERYTHING IN OUR POWER TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF CARE IN THOSE MOST DIFFICULT INSTITUTIONS. BUT I DON'T WANT TO PAINT TOO ROSY A PICTURE. GETTING TO THE FINISH LINE WITH THESE LAST INSTITUTIONS IS GOING TO BE VERY HARD WORK. AND IT WILL REQUIRE VERY CLOSE COOPERATION WITH AND SUPPORT FROM SECRETARY DIAZ IN HIS CUSTODY RESOURCE. THE ACTING SECRETARY AND I WORK VERY WELL TOGETHER VERY CLOSELY. AND WE ARE JOINTLY COMMITTED TO GETTING THIS JOB DONE. I WOULD LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT THE SUBCOMMITTEE JUST TWO OF OUR MOST IMPORTANT RECENT DEVELOPMENTS. OUR FIRST I AM PLEASED TO REPORT THAT THE ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS SYSTEM. WHICH WAS A MASSIVE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PROJECT BEGUN A SHORT FIVE OR SIX YEARS AGO. HAS BEEN SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENTED AT ALL INSTITUTION. OUR PATIENTS BENEFIT FROM THIS SYSTEM EVERY SINGLE DAY. OUR MEDICAL RECORDS ARE NOW FINALLY IN SUCH GOOD ORDER. THAT OUR PROVIDERS NURSES ADMINISTRATORS CAN EASILY TRACK EVERY PATIENT'S MEDICAL HISTORY SEE IN MONTREAL TEST RESULTS EASILY SCHEDULE PROVIDER IN SPECIALIST INITIAL AND FOLLOW UP APPOINTMENTS. PRESCRIBE MEDICATIONS AND MONITOR THEIR ADMINISTRATION. NURSE NOTES DOCUMENTING THE CARE THAT IS BEING DELIVERED. EQUALLY IMPORTANTMEDICAL LEADERSHIP OF THE INSTITUTION AT THE REGIONAL LEVEL AT HEADQUARTERS ALL THE WAY UP TO ME PERSONALLY. WE ARE ABLE TO MONITOR THE DELIVERY OF CARE. IN REAL TIME. I'M WHEN I BEGAN BACK IN WHATEVER THAT WAS. TWO THOUSAND EIGHT WE HAD ONLY PAPER RECORDS. AND WHEN I STARTED WE HAD FIFTY THOUSAND INCHES OF ON FILED MEDICAL RECORDS WHICH IS ABOUT WE USED TO SAY TO EMPIRE STORIES -- TO EMPIRE BUILDINGS WORTH OF MEDICAL RECORDS. THAT IS ALL GONE. ON AND WE ARE NOW INTO A TWENTY FIRST CENTURY -- ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD. SECOND I'M THE SECOND MAJOR -- DEVELOPMENT. AFTER SUBSTANTIAL -- INTERNAL DELIBERATION LAST YEAR. I JOIN WITH UNDERSECRETARY DIANA TASCHEN DIRECTING OUR STAFF TO DEVELOP A MEDICATION ASSISTED THE TREATMENT PROGRAM. TO ADDRESS THE SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF PATIENTS WITH LCD C. R. WHO HAVE SUBSTANCE INDOOR OPIOID USE DISORDERS. A WITH A DIRECTION INITIALLY TO FOCUS ON THOSE PATIENTS WHO ARE AT HIGHEST RISK FOR OVERDOSE. AS THE MEMBERS OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE NO. SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER S. YOU DO USE A COMPLEX CHRONIC HEALTH CONDITION [inaudible] INVOLVING DOPAMINE DYSREGULATION IN THE BRAIN THAT CONTROS REWARDED MOTIVATION. AND CAN LEAD TO UNCONTROLLABLE CRAVINGS CONTINUED SUBSTANCE USE ANOTHER ABHORRENT BEHAVIORS. WHICH CONTRIBUTES TO PERMANENT DISABILITY PREMATURE DEATH. ANOTHER ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES FOR AFFLICTED INDIVIDUALS FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES. IN RECENT YEARS ARE OPIOID USE DISORDER -- IS THE PRIMARY -- S. U. D. E. ASSOCIATED WITH THE INCREASE AND NON FATAL OVERDOSES NATIONALLY. IN CALIFORNIA. AND IN CDC ARE. WE ESTIMATE OF THE PREVALENCE OF S. U. D. AMONG THE CDC OUR POPULATION IS APPROXIMATELY 80%. AND THAT AT LEAST 26% THAT'S ABOUT TWENTY SIX THOUSAND PATIENTS. HAVE -- OPIOID USE DISORDER. CURRENTLY THE DIVISION OF REHABILITATION OFFERS BEHAVIOR THERAPIES TO ALL CDC OUR INSTITUTIONS THROUGH VARIOUS INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS. ALL MOST OF THE BEHAVIORAL THERAPY SERVICES DELIVERED BY THE CONTRACTORS ARE BASED ON MODELS THAT HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO BE EFFECTIVE IN SPECIFIC GROUPS OF PATIENTS IF IMPLEMENTED AS INTENDED. OF FRANKLY THE RELIABILITY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THESE TREATMENTS WITHIN THE CDC ARE IS LARGELY KNOWN. ADDITIONALLY THE CURRENT S. UT TREATMENT MODEL USED BY DR P. IS NOT BASED ON A MEDICAL CHRONIC CARE MODEL. WHICH IS HOW WE HAVE ON THE MEDICAL PROGRAM A REDUCED ARE AVOIDABLE DEATHS -- DURING THE COURSE OF THE RECEIVERSHIP. INSTEAD THE TREATMENT DURATION IS ONLY FIVE MONTHS AND CURRENT AVAILABLE TREATMENT CAPACITY IS LESS THAN TWELVE THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS PER YEAR. SO WE WILL BE PROPOSING AN M. A. N. M. A. T. PROGRAM INVOLVING LONG TERM COMBINATION THERAPY WITH MEDICATIONS AND BEHAVIORAL INTERVENTIONS. THAT WAS WILL BE BEST DELIVERED IN AN INTEGRATED HEALTH CARE SETTING. USING INTERDISCIPLINARY TEAMS WHO TAKE CARE OF THEIR PATIENTS THROUGHOUT THE CONTINUUM OF CARE. THIS APPROACH WILL PROVIDE GREATER OPPORTUNITY TO ENSURE RELIABILITY. EFFECTIVENESS AND EFFICIENCY IN THE DELIVERY OF CLINICAL TREATMENTS. WHICH IN TURN SHOULD ALLOW BETTER COST CONTROL. AND PROMOTE BETTER. POSITIVE OUTCOMES. INCLUDING DECREASES IN RELAPSE FATAL AND NONFATAL OVERDOSES ABNORMAL BEHAVIORS WITHIN THE PRISON SETTING. AND HOPEFULLY ULTIMATELY A REDUCTION OF RECIDIVISM. IN OUR MODEL S. UT TREATMENT WOULD CONTINUE OUR AFTER RELEASE FROM CDC ARE CUSTOM. IN COORDINATION WITH EXTERNAL STAKEHOLDERS HAS BEGUN. ON NOVEMBER TWENTY SEVEN TWENTY EIGHTEEN WE CONVENED A TREATING SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER EXTERNAL STAKEHOLDERS SUMMIT. ATTENDEES INCLUDED REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE LEGISLATURE OF THIS COMMITTEE. A PRISON LAW OFFICE UNIVERSITIES COUNTY PROBATION DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH SERVICES JAILS. OF THE OREGON DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS JERRY AND EXPERIENCE. DEPARTMENT OF STATE HOSPITALS -- CDC OUR ARMS BIRDS MOM OFFICE. PRISON INDUSTRY AUTHORITY LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE BERMAN FINANCE. THE FORMER REPRESENTATIVES AND FORMER GOVERNOR BROWN'S OFFICE AND THE OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL AMONG OTHERS. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STAKEHOLDER MEETING WAS -- TO BRIEF THEM ON OUR INTENDED PROGRAM. AND PROVIDE THEM WITH AN OPPORTUNITY TO RESPOND TO OUR PLAN. UP TO ENSURE ACCESS TO CARE FOR PATIENTS WITH S. UT DURING A HIGH RISK OF TRANSITIONS TO THE FREE WORLD AT TIME OF RELEASE. ADDITIONALLY THE SUN WAS OLD IDENTIFY BEST PRACTICES OPPORTUNITIES AND LEVERAGE POINTS TO IMPROVE CARE DURING TRANSITIONS. I ESTABLISH ONGOING COLLABORATION AND COMMUNICATION WITH OUR PARTNERS. I DO LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING THIS SPRING AND SUMMER -- WITH MEMBERS OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE ON THE MANY ISSUES THAT WILL BE INVOLVED IN THE PLANNING AND IMPLEMENTATION OF THAT NEW TREATMENT PROGRAM -- CAM WITH THAT MADAM CHAIR I'M BE DELIGHTED TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THE OVERVIEW -- OR WE CAN TURN TO ISSUE SEVEN THANK YOU [inaudible] QUESTIONS [inaudible] MORE LIKE. MR KELSO NICE TO MEET YOU NICE TO MEET YOU SENATOR I KNOW YOU BY REPUTATION [inaudible] I'M. SO IT SAID GOOD TO BECOME ACQUAINTED I I JUST HAVE ONE QUESTION AND AND IN I WOULD ASSUME. IN YOUR ROLE THAT IT'S YOUR JOB TO WORK YOURSELF OUT OF THAT JOB. AND I'M JUST WONDERING HOW THAT'S WORKING. FOR WELL -- AS I'VE INDICATED WE MADE SUBSTANTIAL PROGRESS IN THE DELEGATIONS ARE WE'RE DOWN TO OF THE LAST REMAINING MOST DIFFICULT INSTITUTIONS. NOW I HAVE A LASER FOCUS ON COMPLETING THAT TASK I THINK THINGS ARE GOING [inaudible] REASONABLY WELL. I WOULD HAVE PREFERRED. FRANKLY THAT THESE LAST INSTITUTIONS WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO IMPROVE THEMSELVES -- USING ALL THE TOOLS AND POLICIES AND PROCEDURES WE PUT IN PLACE JUST AS OF THE OTHERS. THEY HAVE PROVEN TO BE MORE RESISTANT TO IMPROVEMENTS. AND FRANKLY WHAT WE ARE DOING RIGHT NOW IS TRYING TO DIAGNOSE. WHAT'S THE PROBLEM. BECAUSE WE KNOW THE TOOLS THAT WE HAVE IN PLACE WORK. IT'S JUST ARE NOT WORKING OF THOSE INSTITUTIONS. AND AS YOU CAN IMAGINE IT'S A REALLY COMPLEX CHALLENGE. OF THE FIGURE OUT WELL WHY HASN'T WORKED AND THEN ONCE THE APPROPRIATE SOLUTION TO THAT PROBLEM. SO I'M THAT'S WHY I REMAIN OPTIMISTIC THAT I'M GOING TO CONTINUE. IN THE DIRECTION OF WORKING MYSELF OUT OF A JOB. GREAT SO. I CAN INFER THAN THAT IS MAYBE A SQUARE PEG IN A ROUND HOLE VERSES INSUBORDINATION. I DON'T BELIEVE IT'S INSUBORDINATION [inaudible] THANK. THANK YOU MANAGER [inaudible] SENATOR BREAUX -- JUST. THE SUBSTANCE ABUSE -- PROGRAM IS. ONE OF THE OTHER WAY -- AFTER FOUR YEARS OF RAISING THIS ISSUE IN THIS. AND GETTING THE PROGRAM GOING ON A COMPREHENSIVE BASIS. WHAT KIND OF -- STEPS YOU YOU THINK WILL BE TAKEN. TO TOTALLY EMPLOYMENT -- DRUG TREATMENT FOR ALL THE INMATES THAT HAVE DRUG ABUSE PROBLEMS AND HOW HOW DOES THE THE ELECTRONIC RECORDS. TRANSITION WHEN THEY LEAVE PRISON. IT WAS SO NICE. THEY GO INTO A LOCAL HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS -- THOSE RECORDS ARE KEY TO PROVIDE GOOD. HEALTHCARE TREATMENT ONCE THEY LEAVE. RESIDENT AND I I KNOW YOU THOUGHT ABOUT THIS WHAT DO YOU ARE YOU -- EXPLAINED TO THE MERRY. WELL THANK YOU SENATOR OFTEN QUESTION AND AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR LONG ISSUE BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY YOU'RE ADVOCACY IS IN PART OF THE REASON THAT. WE MADE THE DECISION LAST YEAR -- TO TO GO MUCH BROADER I'M. V. R. WERE IN THE PROCESS OF PUTTING TOGETHER AN ESSENTIALLY AN IMPLEMENTATION PLAN FOR HOW WE WOULD ROLL THIS OUT BECAUSE IT'S A VERY BIG PROGRAM. I'M AND WE DON'T WANT TO TRY TO IMPLEMENT TOO MUCH. ALL AT ONCE M. STUMP. THE FOCUS OF OUR FIRST AVERAGE IS GOING TO BE ON MAKING SURE THAT INMATES AS THE INITIALLY COME INTO THE SYSTEM WHO ARE ALREADY ON SOME FORM OF TREATMENT. THERE WE MAINTAIN CONTINUITY OF THAT TREE. WHICH WE HAVE NOT REALLY PREVIOUSLY DOT. SECOND WE'RE MOST INTERESTED IN CATCHING PEOPLE WHO ARE ABOUT TO BE RELEASED. AND MAKING SURE THAT WE GET TO THEM EARLY ENOUGH SO THAT THEY CAN GET INTO AN OF THE CONDITIONS OF THE PROGRAM. SO AT THE TIME OF RELEASE OF WHAT WE'VE DONE AS MUCH AS WE CAN. I'M WILL SO WE'LL START OF THOSE ENDS AND THEN OF A GRADUALLY MOVE TOWARDS OF BUILDING THE PROGRAM OUT TO ALL INMATES THE GROUP IN THE MIDDLE. IN TERMS OF THE U. COORDINATION -- AT THE TIME OF RELEASE THAT OBVIOUSLY IS CRITICAL. IN OTHER OF THIS YOU KNOW THERE ARE A LOT OF ISSUES YOU HAVE TO WORK WITH TO TRY TO MAKE SURE THAT IN THOSE FIRST TWO WEEKS AFTER RELEASED. SOMEBODY ACTUALLY GETS IN FRONT OF A PROVIDER IN THE COUNTY. AND THAT THE TRANSITION IS VERY LOS. ILLEGAL PROVIDERS WITH ONE WE WANT TO GET IN FRONT OF THE PROVIDERS THAT WE ARE COORDINATING. NOW. THE GOOD NEWS ON THAT FRONT WITH THE ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORD -- WE NOW ARE AT A POINT -- WE RECEIVED ALIVE BELIEVE IT'S CORRECT TO SAY IT'S A CERTIFICATION BUT WE ARE AT A POINT WHERE WE ARE ABLE NOW TO SHARE -- INFORMATION DIGITALLY FROM OUR MEDICAL RECORD. TO QUALIFYING -- LOCAL. MEDICAL RECORD SYSTEMS AND I'M FAIRLY CONFIDENT I'M GOING TO SAY THIS IN THE CITY OF MY STAFF. MODS I BELIEVE FOR EXAMPLE THAT IN A LOS ANGELES COUNTY WHERE WE'VE BEEN DOING THIS WITH RESPECT TO MENTAL HEALTH RECORDS FOR SOME TIME. THAT WE'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO HAVE A FAIRLY I'M. EASY PROCESS WE WILL BE ABLE TO SELECT WHAT INFORMATION FROM OUR MEDICAL RECORD CAN BE SHARED DIGITALLY. WITH LOCAL PROVIDER. MY STAFF HAS NOT IT [inaudible] ACOSTA [inaudible] YES [inaudible] DRUG ABUSE [inaudible] MENTAL HEALTH. HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. YES. I DID AND I KNOW I'VE FORGOTTEN THE DETAILS OF THIS BUT I BELIEVE WE WE HAVE HAD TO DO SOMETHING TO BECOME FULLY HIPPA COMPLIANT SO WE CAN DO THAT HAND OFF. AND AND I MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT IS WHERE WE NOW ARE. WE DID A WE DID SOME BILLS OF OF ALLOWING THE COUNTY CORRECTIONAL SYSTEMS. TO GIVE HEALTHCARE INFORMATION AND TO THEIR HEALTHCARE -- AND SOCIAL STATURE SERVICE AGENCIES YES OF SO THE PICTURE THE RECORDS THE THING ABOUT THE PLAN. NO DISBURSING THE CONFIDENTIALITY ISSUE. ON THE HEALTH CORRECT SO -- W. SOMETHING -- THE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE IT'S YEAH. JEFF WE INTERESTED NOT ISSUE -- YES -- ONE OF ONE OF THINGS HAPPEN IN THE LAST THREE YEARS. AS YOU KNOW. IS -- THE FENCE ALL HAVE EPIDEMIC. AND THE DEATH RATE -- THE CALIFORNIA IS GOING UP IN THE UNITED STATES ACTUALLY IS GOING UP IN A ASTRONOMICAL FASHION. BECAUSE OF OKAY -- LACED WITH FENNEL [inaudible] AND THIS SPECIALLY -- PRESENTS VULNERABILITIES TO PEOPLE LEAVING [inaudible] PERSPIRATION [inaudible] AND IN TERMS OF GOING BACK TO ADDICTION YOU THINK THAT -- DOES THE MEDICATION PROGRAM. ARE YOU LOOKING OUT HOW THE ON THAT. ISSUE. OF WHEN THEY LEAVE AND THEN THEY IMMEDIATELY. TRY. TO GET THE DRUGS AND THE DEATH WITH DEFICIT WE SEE WHEN PEOPLE LEAVE PRISON. PEOPLE DIE WITHIN THE PRISON AND THEY TAKE THE DRUG HAPPENS THERE OF WOULD BE JUST NO PH&lt;c.cyan&gt; N&lt;/c&gt; AND THE WINNER WITH THE OVERDOSE BECAUSE TEY'RE NOT USED TO THE THE OLD LOW. YOU EXPRESS WHAT WILL CERTAINLY THE THAT'S THE BIGGER WORRY ABOUT THIS TO DEATH -- MORBIDITY ISSUES [inaudible] FOUND. SO THE COMMONEST DOWNING. JUST FIFTY OF THE NUMBERS ARE GOING UP THREE FOUR TIMES WITH THE YEARS THE YOU KNOW JUST A FEW YEARS AGO THREE FOUR YEARS AGO. ALMOST ARE WE WE ARE -- WE PERSONALLY EXPERIENCE THAT -- WITH OUR PATIENTS AND SEE SEE OUR FRONTAL COMES IN WE SEEN DEATHS RELATED TO A FATAL USE SO THE OF THAT PARTICULARLY DANGEROUS DRUG -- THE THE GOAL OF OUR GOAL AND FOCUSING ON SINCE WHO ARE ABOUT TO BE RELEASED. IS TO SEE IF WE CAN GET THEM SOBRE AT THE TIME OF RELEASE. AND CONNECTED WITH LOCAL SUPPORT SERVICES NOT JUST MEDICAL BUT SOCIAL WORK SERVICES. SEE IF WE CAN. KEEP THEM FROM TAKING ANY OF THE DRUGS IN THOSE FIRST TWO WEEKS. THOUGH IT IS AN ISSUE THAT -- WE ARE FOCUSED ON TRYING TO ADDRESS IN THIS LARGELY THROUGH. GETTING THEM READY AT THE TIME OF RELEASE IN THE IN CLOSE COORDINATION WITH LOCAL SUPPORT SERVICES THAT YOU NEED IN ORDER TO BE SUCCESSFUL UPON RELEASE. AND AND I'VE TO MAKE IT CLEAR IT'S IT'S AS YOU KNOW IT'S NOT JUST. EIGHTY MEDICATION PROBLEM. IT'S A PROBLEM DEALING WITH THE ENTIRE RANGE OF SERVICES THAT SOMEONE NEEDS UPON LEAVING PRISON. A TO FEEL LIKE OR MAYBE ABOUT A CHANCE OUT HERE. SO WE ARE WORKING CLOSELY WITH OUR PARTNERS. WHO WOULD BE PROVIDING THOSE SERVICES? ARE YOU INVOLVED -- OR TO WHAT EXTENT IS MAYBE THE TALK ABOUT THIS THE PAROLE -- SYSTEM IS SUPPOSED TO BE RESPONSIBLE. FOR OF SOME OF THE ISSUE TALK ABOUT [inaudible] ARE -- TERMS OF TRAINING EQUIPMENT EQUIPMENT WITH ABILITY -- HOWEVER THE BE. IF YOU LOOK AT THEIR RETRAINING NEEDS [inaudible] TO MAYBE. DEAL WITH THIS ISSUE -- FROM THE PRO DEPARTMENTS PERSPECTIVE. HOW HOW WHAT KIND OF THINGS THEY HAVE TO DO THE? FIT IN WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. I'M CENTER THAT QUESTION GOES TO A LEVEL OF DETAIL THAT I'M GOING TO SEE IF MY STAFF GOING TO DRESS. I UNDERSTAND THAT. IMPORTANCE OF THE QUESTION. ABOUT WELL WHICH ROLE PERHAPS -- WE COULD DO IS RATHER THAN HEARING THE VERBAL REPORTS SPECIALLY GIVEN THAT YOU MAY NOT PREPARED FOR IT WE THIS IS. PART OF OUR ON IN ADDITION TO YOUR ROLE AS THE RECEIVER IT'S PART OF OUR APPROPRIATE UNNECESSARY ATTENTION TO MAKING SURE THAT OUR I'M. THE WHAT WE ARE DOING WITH IN THE PRISON IS PREPARING FOR SUCCESS FOR ENTRY AND THEN WHAT WE ARE DOING. WITH PAROLE WHICH IS THE SUPERVISION OF PEOPLE. ON THAT IT IS [inaudible] BEING DESIGNED. INTENTIONALLY AND ADEQUATELY. TO HELP US ENSURE THAT WE DON'T HAVE THESE PROBLEMS OF EITHER. AND ADDRESS SUBSTANCE DISORDER WHICH THEN CAUSES EITHER A DEATH OR RETURN TO PRISON. I'M AND WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A HEARINGWHERE WE FOCUS VERY AG IN MUCH MORE DETAIL AROUND. THE REENTRY PORTIONS ON BOTH FREE RELEASED RIGHT REENTRY PREPARATION. PAROLE. AND THAT -- TO PROVISION OF PAROLE. SO. PERHAPS IN PREPARATION FOR THAT. I'M A SOMETHING FROM YOUR DIVISIONS PERSPECTIVE FOR YOUR OFFICE'S PERSPECTIVE WOULD ASSIST US. HAPPY TO OBLIGE -- I HAVE SOME LEGISLATION RANCHER ON ON THE ISTHMUS PROGRAM THE PROGRAM. OPERATED BY THE POOL SYSTEM WHICH IS NOT PROVEN TO BE -- ADEQUATE -- IN DEALING WITH THESE ISSUES AND I THINK THAT. THE HEARING BE VERY VALUABLE IN TERMS OF LOOKING AT A BETTER MODEL. TO HAVE THAT TRANSITION -- FOR IN A WAY WHERE WE CAN GET THE BEST POSSIBLE SERVICES THE BILL ONCE THE COMMUNITY. SO I HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS. STICKING ON MEDIA. SUBSTANCE ABUSE DISORDERS LINE FOR A FEW MOMENTS -- YOU MENTIONED THAT WE HAVE. YOUR ESTIMATE IS A 2600026% OF OUR OF FOLKS CURRENTLY IN OUR STATE PRISONS HAVE AN OPIOID USE DISORDER. NOW IF THAT. WHAT I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND IS IF THERE ARE NOT BEING PROVIDED THE MEDICAL ASSISTANCE UNLESS THEY HAVE? GONE THROUGH APPROPRIATE TREATMENT IN OUR WHATEVER -- NO LONGER UTILIZING THE DRUG. THEN THAT MEANS THEY ARE THAT WE BUT WHATEVER NUMBER CLOSE. TO TWENTY SIX THOUSAND WHO RE REGULAR OTP YOUR USERS WITHIN OUR FACILITY [inaudible] AND THAT WE OBVIOUSLY HAVE. PUT ON A GOOD DEAL OF NEW INVESTMENT TO TRY TO DO DRUG INTERDICTION -- WOULD APPEAR THAT. WELL MAYBE IT'S HAD A LITTLE IMPACTED WOULD CERTAINLY INDICATE NOT MUCH. AND CERTAINLY WITH -- BUT NO BECAUSE OF ITS MINUSCULE QUANTITIES SO EASY TO GET IN. TO A FACILITY. I JUST WONDER. WHETHER -- WHAT'S THOUGHT THERE WOULD BE. WHETHER A BROADER USE OF MEDICALLY ASSISTED TREATMENT MIGHT. BE MORE EFFECTIVE THAN MOST OF OUR DRUG INTERDICTION PROGRAMS. AND I ASKED THAT ON A COUPLE LEVELS [inaudible] ONE PLEASE ME. I DON'T UNDERSTAND THE I DON'T HAVE ENOUGH KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE THE USE OF LIKE IF I'M AN OPIOID ADDICT. AND I AM UNDER MEDICAL ASSISTED TREATMENT DOES THAT PRETTY MUCH DO I STILL. DOES THAT NEGATE MY DESIRE TO THEN FIND THE ILLEGAL SUBSTANCE OR DO I STILL HAVE THAT CRAVING. SO IN OTHER WORDS AND THAT'S ONE QUESTION AND THEN THE SECOND ONE IS. LET'S SAY I AM ON THE MEDICALLY ASSISTED TREATMENT. BUT SOMEHOW I HAVE ACCESS. WHILE I'M STILL IN THE FACILITY. TO THE ONLY I USE THAT WHILE I AM ON THE MEDICALY ASSISTED. DOES THAT ENHANCE MY OVERDOSE OF POTENTIAL OR SO IF YOU COULD JUST ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE. MAINTENANCE IS LIKE A FROG SO. GOING. I WON'T ENDEAVOR TO RESPOND TO SOME OF THOSE -- SUDDENLY JUMPS UP PLEASE LET ME KNOW -- WELL IN TERMS OF THE THE OF YOUR INITIAL QUESTION CAN THIS BE MORE SUCCESSFUL THAN INTERDICTION. YES I THINK IT CAN BE A BECAUSE INTERDICTION UP HAS NOT YET WORKED. ON THE THE INTENTION HERE IS ULTIMATELY. TO HAVE RESOURCES THAT WILL ENABLE US TO PROVIDE TREATMENT TO ANYONE WHO WANTS TREATMENT -- THANK YOU MY MEDICAL RESOURCES HAVE A RIDE. THE IT IT'S A COMPLEX QUESTION FRANKLY WHETHER -- YOU KNOW AS A GENERAL MATTER THE MEDICATION ASSISTED THERAPY -- ELIMINATE -- CONSISTENTLY THE CRAVING. THE THE THE REASON IT'S A COMPLEX -- QUESTION AND THE ANSWER THERE'S NOT A SINGLE DRUG THAT YOU USE THERE ARE VARIATIONS DEPENDING UPON THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE PARTICULAR PATIENT. A WHAT'S MEDICALLY APPROPRIATE FOR THEM. IN ADDITION OF THE MEDICATION OF THESE PROGRAMS REALLY DON'T WORK UNLESS YOU HAVE SUCCESSFUL COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPY. TO CHANGE BEHAVIOR. BECAUSE OF THE END OF THE DAY IF SOMEBODY DECIDES. I'M DON'T WANT TO CONTINUE THIS PROGRAM I'D RATHER JUST TAKE THE DRUGS. THAT'S WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. IN IN THE PRISONS YOU HAVE AN ENVIRONMENT I THINK RIGHT NOW WHERE IT'S PROBABLY EVEN MORE THAN JUST THE DRUGS ARE AVAILABLE. DRUGS ARE BEING PUSHED ON PEOPLE. IN THERE'S SOME FEAR AND INTIMIDATION TO GET PEOPLE. TO BUY DRUGS. BECAUSE THIS IS A YOU. MONEY IS BEING MADE OFF OF THIS. SO WE ANTICIPATE. THAT EVEN ARE BEING AS EFFECTIVE YOU CAN BE WITH THESE PROGRAMS OF THIS IS TRUE AROUND THE COUNTRY. THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT POTENTIAL ALWAYS [inaudible] FOR RELAPSE. AND THERE THERE DOES COME A CYCLE WHERE SOMEBODY WILL RELAPSE AND THEN YOU TRY TO GET HIM BACK ON THE PROGRAM. BUT IT IT'S NOT SOMETHING WHERE YOU HAVE -- YOU CAN PREDICT. A 100% SUCCESS. BY WAY OF COMPARISON WELL AS YOU ALL KNOW WE WE HAD ASKED THE LEGISLATURE AND RECEIVE SUPPORT FOR OUR HABSI A PROGRAM. WELL THAT'S ONE WE'RE WE'RE PROBABLY ONE OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL. I HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS IN THE STATE IN TERMS OF IF SOMEBODY'S ON THAT PROGRAM THEY ARE NOT. A RE CONTRACTING -- Là CONDITION [inaudible] ARMED. THAT'S ONE WHERE THERE IS YOU'RE GIVEN THE PILLS YOU'VE GOT THE TWELVE WEEK OR EIGHT WEEKS SEEK ONCE YOUR GET A CURE. THIS IS MUCH MORE LIKE CHRONIC CONDITIONS. WHERE IT REQUIRES THE? IN GAUGE WANT. OF THE PATIENT. AND WE ALL KNOW WITH CHRONIC CONDITIONS -- DIABETES. AND AM I GONNA TAKE MY PILLS IN MY GOING TO REDUCE Y DIET MY GOING TO EXERCISE -- RELAPSE RATES ARE SIGNIFICANT. SO -- PART OF THE CHALLENGE WE HAVE IN THIS IS I THINK SOMETHING THAT WE NEED -- TO IN OUR OWN PLANNING AND CONVERSATION LEGISLATURE. WE NEED TO ESTABLISH SOME. I'M REALISTIC EXPECTATIONS OF WHAT THIS CAN ACCOMPLISH. BECAUSE IT'S NOT GONNA BE A 100%. IT'S GOING TO BE LESS THAN. AND THAT IS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I'VE ASKED STAFF IN CONSULTING WITH NATIONAL EXPERTS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT. WHAT WE'RE GETTING FOR THIS SORT OF AN INVESTMENT? WILL PRESS FOR FOR THE DOCTOR ANSWERS THE QUESTION THE OTHER PORTION OF MY QUESTION. IS OUR OF THIS TWENTY SIX THOUSAND PEOPLE. ARE THEY CONCENTRATED IN CERTAIN THE FACILITIES COMPARED TO OTHERS. OR IS THIS PRETTY MUCH EQUALLY DISTRIBUTED ACROSS ALL OF OUR THIRTY SOME ODD [inaudible] PRISON FACILITY. I BELIEVE THAT I DON'T THINK IT'S JUST EQUALLY. I THINK THERE ARE CONCENTRATIONS. BUT IT IS AT ALL THIRTY FIVE OKAY SO IF IT'S ALL THIRTY FIVE BUT YOU COULD GIVE US. AND AGAIN YOU KNOW I HAVE TO DO IT VERBALLY NOW THAT YOU COULD. PROVIDE US. I'M WHICH FACILITIES PERHAPS WERE HAS A HIGHER CONCENTRATION. SO THAT WE AT LEAST AN HOUR APPROACHING HOW TO DEAL WITH THIS WE HAVE SOME SENSE. RIGHT MAYBE ONE SIZE DOESN'T FIT ALL. YEAH WE WILL BE ABLE TO PROVIDE YOU WITH SOME DATA POINTS WILL SUGGEST WHERE THERE ARE HIGHER CONCENTRATIONS OF PROBLEM. AFTER ONLY REASON AFTER WE MATCH WOMEN TO HAPPEN IF YOU CAN GIVE ME A NUMBER OF TWENTY SIX THOUSAND AND YOU MEANS YOU'RE TRACKING TO SOME DEGREE SO YOU HAVE SOME SENSE OF WHERE THE CAMERA AROUND I WILL ADMIT MUCH OF MUCH OF THE INFORMATION WE HAVE ON THE TWENTY SIX ON UNIVERSITY. OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY IT'S AN ESTIMATE OKAY BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T BEEN FROM A ON THE MEDICAL SIDE. WE DON'T COUNT. THROUGH SCREENING THOSE PEOPLE. OF THAT WILL BE SOMETHING THAT THE THROUGH THE AS WE BEGIN IMPLEMENTATION. WILL START TO GET MUCH BETTER DATA ABOUT WHAT THE NUMBERS ARE AND WHERE THEY ARE BUT WE HAVE SOME ESTIMATES -- WE CAN LOOK AT WHERE THE OVERDOSE A NUMBER OF OVERDOSE IS ARE THERE SOME INFORMATION WE HAVE AND WILL PROVIDE THAT TO THE COMMITTEE. AND THEN ON THE QUESTION OF WHETHER -- IF I'M ON MEDICALLY ASSISTED TREATMENT AND THEN I USE THE WHETHER HEROIN OR FELT NO ALERT IS MY LIKELIHOOD OF OVERDOSE INCREASE. AND AND JUST THOSE MEDICAL PART. IT DEPENDS ON HOW WE'RE TREATING THE THE PATIENT AND WHAT'S RIGHT AND WHAT DRUGS ARE USED AYE I'M DOCTOR THIRD I'M DIRECTOR OF HEALTH CARE OPERATIONS FOR THE RECEIVER -- LET'S TALK ABOUT BUPRENORPHINE WHICH IS THE DRUG THATIS MOST EFFECTIVE IN WILL BE THE MAIN STATE DRUG WE WILL BE USING WILL BE USING A RANGE OF DRUGS. BUT BUPRENORPHINE IS IS A MAIN WAS IS NOW NEW DRUGS BEEN AROUND FOREVER. IT HAS PROPERTIES THE IN IN THE IN THE BODY THAT YET BOTH -- BEHAVES LIKE AN OPIOID IN OTHER WORDS THAT KNELLER MORPHINE OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT BUT ALSO BEHAVES LIKE NOR CANON ANTAGONISED TO THE EUPHORIA IT'S WHAT WE CALL A MIXED. A MIX DAGEN THIS ANTAGONISED ACTIVE AT REMOVING YOUR CRAVING. FOR NARCOTICS YOU WILL NOT GO INTO WITHDRAWAL ON AN APPROPRIATE DOSE DRUG. BECAUSE IT HAS MIXED AFFECTS YOU WILL ALSO NOT GET YOU FORK. THE THE THE RIGHT SURE THE HIGH OF FROM AN ILLICIT OBTAIN SUBSTANCE. THE DRUG BECAUSE IT HAS NEXT ANTAGONISE PROPERTIES. IT IS POSSIBLE TO GET A LETHAL OVERDOSE OF FENTANYL I MEAN THE FENNEL IS INCREDIBLY POTENT DRUG AND WE'RE NOT ONLY DEALING WITH THAT NOW WE'RE ACTUALLY DEALING WITH FENNEL ANALOGUES WHICH ARE EVEN MORE POTENT THAN MEN FENNEL YOU CAN GET INTO SOME OF THESE DRUGS. THAT ARE TEN THOUSAND TIMES AS POTENT AS REGULAR FENTANYL ABOVE THE I'M OUT OVER MORPHINE SO IT IS POSSIBLE FOR YOU -- TO TO HAVE A LETHAL OVERDOSE WHILE YOU WERE ON BUPRENORPHINE HOWEVER IT IS MUCH MORE DIFFICULT TO DO. BUT AS AS A RECEIVER POINTED OUT. YOU ALSO HAVE TO CONSIDER THE ENVIRONMENT WITH WHICH WE WILL BE PRESCRIBING THIS MEDICATION. AND SO THE MOTIVATION OF AN INDIVIDUAL PATIENT TO TO OBTAIN ILLICIT DRUGS IS GOING TO BE DEPENDENT ON THE ENVIRONMENT THEY ARE IN. AND AS WAS POINTED OUT THERE IS SOME QUARTERS IN FOR SEEN YEAH THERE IS A LARGE TRADE. IN THESE DRUGS WITH IN THE PRISON SYSTEM -- THROUGHOUT THE SYSTEM IN SPITE IN TERMS OF INTERDICTION BEING A LESS EFFECTIVE -- STRATEGY AND THAT'S NO DIFFERENT REALLY THAN ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE WORLD NEIL INTERDICTION STRATEGIES HAVE BEEN EMPLOYED WITH VARYING DEGREES OF SUCCESS. SO THE QUESTION YOU'RE REALLY ASKING IS HOW QUICKLY CAN WE GET TO THIS MIDDLE GROUP OF PEOPLE. WE'RE TAKING THE HIGHEST GROUP YOU KNOW THE PEOPLE COMING AND WE'RE CONTINUE THE MEDICATIONS ARE ON WAS. THE GROUP THIS LEAVING WHICH IS ABSOLUTELY KEY BECAUSE A SENATOR BELL POINTED OUT IT'S NOT TWO WEEKS IS TO DATE. YOU KNOW THAT THE OVER THE OVER DOSE RATE YOU KNOW IS ANYWHERE BETWEEN DEATH THE IS WITHIN SEVENTY TWO HOURS RELEASE. SO WHAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT A HAND IN GLOVE TRANSFER TO FIFTY EIGHT DIFFERENT COUNTIES WITH FIFTY EIGHT DIFFERENT WAYS OF DOING THINGS AND FIFTY EIGHT DIFFERENT LEVELS OF RESOURCE. THOSE WILL BE OUR FOCUS AND THEN AS WE MOVE INTO HIS MIDDLE GROUP WE'RE GOING TO FOCUS ON OUR HIGHEST RISK PATIENTS FIRST. AND THAT LARGELY IS A GROUP THAT IS ALREADY ATTEMPTED OVERDOSE INNER HAS SURVIVED. I IS THE HIGHEST GROUP. THE GROUP THAT IS CURRENTLY UNDERGOING HEPATITIS C. TREATMENT BECAUSE THEY GENERALLY GOT THEIR DISEASE FROM INTRAVENOUS DRUG USE AND WE'RE SPENDING LARGE SUMS OF MONEY ON THEM WE ACTUALLY HAVE VERY SAD CASES NOW WE'RE WE HAVE CURED PEOPLE THEIR HEPATITIS C.. ONLY SEE AND DIVERT DRUG OVERDOSE. ARM SO THOSE WILL BE THE GROUP'S WILL FOCUS ON AND WILL FOCUS SAID A SET OF OF HUBS WILL SHOW YOU ALL THE IMPLEMENTATION THINGS WE'VE GOT BUT YOU KNOW AS FAR AS WE KNOW NO ONE IS TEMPTED THIS ON THIS SCALE. SO WE'RE GONNA LEARN AS WE GO ON WE'VE GOT OUR BEST IDEAS WE ALLOW REAL SMART PEOPLE IN THE ROOM THAT GIVEN THIS ADVICE BOTH INTERNAL EXTERNAL CDC ARE. BUT WE'RE GONNA WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO BE INFORMED WITH OUR INITIAL ROLE LOTS OF WHAT HAPPENS FROM THERE. THANK YOU I A MINUTES. SOME. ARE YOU LOOKING AT THAT IS EXTENDED -- YOU KNOW LIKE INJECTABLE ONCE THE ONE OF THE PLAN AND THE THE IMPLANTS. THE SO THEY BEFORE THEY LEAVE PRISON THEY GET THAT. IN MY LAST -- LITTLE TIME WELL WHAT THE MANUFACTURER IS DOING SOMETHING LIKE THAT YEAH WITH IT WITHOUT GETTING INTO A MONTH OR SO. WITH IT WITHOUT GETTING INTO INTO YOU KNOW REALLY SUB WE'D LEVEL ON WE'RE LOOKING VERY CLOSELY AT THE AT THE AT THE WAY WE ADMINISTER OF MEDICAID WHICH FORMA MEDICATION WE'RE GOING TO USE. THERE'S WHERE THERE'S ACTUALLY BEEN SEVERAL STUDY IT WHILE SEVERAL THERE'S BEEN TWO STUDIES NOW DONE OUTSIDE OF PRISON ENVIRONMENT TRYING TO COMPARE. THE RELATIVE RISK BENEFITING COST EFFECTIVENESS OF THE LONG ACTING VERSUS THE IMMEDIATE ACTING VERSUS THE DEPOT ACTING. ON AN ACTUALLY THE COST EFFECTIVENESS IS FOR THE SHORT ACTING MEDICATION IN THE IF IF YOU'VE HAD PEOPLE APPROPRIATELY MOTIVATED AND WE SEE THIS NOW WITH THE PATIENTS THAT COME INTO THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT -- IN THE FREE WORLD WITH AN OVERDOSE WHERE WE ACTUALLY INITIATE THERAPY IN THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT BEFORE THEY'VE EVER MADE CONTACT WITH THAT GROUP. IS GOING TO MAINTAIN THEM AND A AND THAT'S BEEN A HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PROGRAMS BEING DONE YOUKNOW AND AND WERE IN VERY CLOSE CONTACT WITH THAT GROUP BECAUSE SOME OF OUR PATIENTS UPON RELEASE. WILL NOW INTERACT IN THAT ENVIRONMENT AS WELL. SO OUR INITIAL PLAN RIGHT NOW ACTING ORAL MEDICATION. ONCE YOU HAVE SOMEBODY STABILIZE FOR A LONGER PERIOD OF TIME THEN THE THE LONG ACTING MEDICATION WORKS WE ARE NOT IN THE HAMMERED RIGHT NOW AT ALL WITH THE DEPOT MEDICATION. BECAUSE OF SOME VERY UNIQUE THINGS IN OUR OUR SERVER IN OUR ENVIRONMENT TOGETHER WITH THE THE CURRENT COST -- YOU WOULD YOU WOULD BE LOOKING AT THE DEPOT TYPE MEDICATION EXCEEDING A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS PER INMATE PER YEAR. WHICH YOU KNOW MAKES OUR MAKES HER HEPATITIS C. TREATMENT LICHTER CHEAP -- I APPRECIATE THE THE NATIONAL INFORMATION -- GIVEN THAT WE HAVE TWENTY SIX THOUSAND PEOPLE IT ESTIMATE IT'S CLEARLY SOMETHING WE HAVE TO GIVE A GOOD ATTENTION TO BUT WHAT I WOULD ENCOURAGE MY COLLEAGUES IS IF THERE ARE ADDITIONAL. QUESTIONS THAT WE HAVE ESPECIALLY AROUND. OUR SUBSTANCE ABUSE -- DISORDERED ST MINTS ARE MEDICALLY ASSISTED TREAT AND WE CAN HAVE OUR STAFF -- MISTER FRANCIS CAN. THEN PREPARE IT AND ASK THE RECEIVER. TO YES SOME OF THOSE ANSWERS SO THAT WHEN WE REVISIT THIS WE HAVE YOU KNOW THE INFORMATION THAT WE ARE HOPING. I WANT TO MOVE ON TO A DIFFERENT -- QUESTION EIGHT WITHIN THE RECEIVERS. VIEW THAT IS NOT AROUND THE SUBSTANCE ABUSE DISORDERS I JUST WANT TO THE CENTER MARK ON OUR ON MENTAL HEALTH. SUBSTANCE ABUSE [inaudible] COMMITTEE. AND THE NO HELP MARCUS IS GOING TO ASK. FOR PRESENTATION -- PROBABLY IN APRIL. ON PROGRAM. SO YOU CAN COME AND MAKE A PRESENTATION WE HAVE USUALLY GET A GOOD CROP ABOUT TWENTY LEGISLATORS. WE ARE VERY PLEASED TO HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY CENTER. RIGHT TO THE THE QUESTION THAT I HAVE BEEN AND YOU CAN PREPARE IT WE DO NOT NEED IT VERBALLY BUT WE'VE HAD IN PAST YEARS HAD A BREAK DOWN SO. I EIGHT SEE FOR MORE MATERIALS THAT WERE CURRENTLY WILL AND IN SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN OUR COST. PER INMATE. FOR MEDICAL CARE ANNUALLY WAS IN THE TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND RANGE I BELIEVE SO MY IS PROBABLY A LITTLE HIGHER EVEN THIS. YEAR THE EIGHTEEN NINETEEN YEAR WHAT I'D LIKE TO SEE IS A BREAKDOWN. OF IT ITEMS MATCHING IT'S LIKE OUR HEALTH INSURANCE OR MET YOU KNOW WE SEE THOSE CHARTS AND THEY SHOW US THAT -- THE AVERAGE COST FOR PROVISION OF HEALTH CARE FOR THE WHOLE POPULATION IS X. BUT IT'S CONCENTRATED 480% IT'S ONLY THIS. AND FOR IF YOU KNOW 5% IT'S THAT NO OTHER FIVE IT'S THIS AND ANOTHER. SO WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE IS THAT KIND OF BREAK DOWN AND THEN WITHIN THAT PERHAPS AGE OR OTHER CHARACTERISTICS. SO THAT WE CAN THEN LOOK AT I'M. NO OBVIOUSLY THE RECEIVERS DRIVE IS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE PROVIDING. THE ADEQUATE HEALTH CARE FOR THOSE PEOPLE THAT WE ARE HOLDING WITH THAT WE ARE INCARCERATED WHAT WHAT. WHAT I FEEL PART OF OUR JOB IS BESIDES MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE DOING THINGS WITH QUALITY AND ACCORDING TO THE LAW? IS ALSO TO MONITOR OUR GENERAL FUND EXPENDITURES AND SO IF WE HAVE. A A RATHER SMALL POPULATION OF INDIVIDUALS THAT WE ARE. HOLDING. THAT ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR A VERY SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR HEALTH YOUR BOSS. WE MAY WANT TO THINK ABOUT WHAT OTHER OPTIONS WE HAVE. AGAIN. I'M WHAT I'M CARTON IS ENOUGH IS THAT WHEN WE LOOK AT OUR ENTIRE CDC OUR BUDGET ONE OF THE LARGEST JUMPS IN THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS. IN TERMS OF OUR EXPENDITURES HAS BEEN. THE HEALTH CARE PORTION SO IT MAKES SENSE THAT WE WOULD HAVE THAT JUMP BECAUSE OF THE WORK ORDER. ON THE OTHER HAND AS I HAVE SAID IN OTHER -- IN EACH ITEM THAT WE TALK ABOUT. EVERY BIT OF INCREASE IN GENERAL FUND EXPENDITURE. WITHIN THE CDC OUR BUDGET.% IS LESS GENERAL FUND ANY OTHER STATE. SO WE CAN GET THAT BREAK DOWN YES MA'AM SURE HAPPY TO PROVIDE THEM WE HAD DONE A SIMILAR ANALYSIS ABOUT. MAYBE FIVE OR SIX YEARS AGO -- IN THE CHART THAT WE DID WE WERE LOOKING AS I RECALL HOSPITAL COSTS IT WAS EXACTLY THE CHART THAT YOU HAVE IN YOUR MIND. A IS FOR THE LOW LOW LOW AND THEN THE LAST COUPLE OF THOUSAND PATIENTS. END UP BEING 40% OF OUR OVERALL COSTS IN TERMS OF HOSPITAL COSTS SO. THE STAFF WILL BURGER PREPARE SUCH A REPORT WE'LL SEE WHAT WE CAN SHARE WITH YOU IF YOU CAN GET MORE GRANULAR. WE WANT TO SEE HOSPITAL COSTS BUT IF IT'S OVER ALL WELL PHARMACEUTICALS WOULD BE THE INCLUDED THERE WE WILL LOOK AT HOW WE CAN GET GREATER DETAIL FOR YOU. ON THAT OUR TOPIC THAT ARE -- HAVE SERIES CHRONIC CONDITIONS MAY NOT BE HOSPITALIZED GROUP BUT MAY BE. IN SUCH AN CAPACITY THAT. WE MAY WANT TO LOOK AT WHAT OTHER OPTIONS WE MIGHT HAVE. YES CENTER RUN THIS PROJECT ISSUE. THE LA COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS SOME INTERESTING THINGS THAT'S EARL TO WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. WHAT THEY DID IS THEY HAD A DISCUSSION ABOUT WHETHER TO BUILD A? NEW PRISON. OUR NEW JAIL IN LA INSTEAD THEY DECIDED. TO NOT DO THAT. AND WHAT THEY'RE DOING IS THEY'RE DEVELOPING A PLAN -- FOR INPATIENT PSYCHIATRIC. HOSPITAL. FACILITIES TO WORK -- DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS SO THEY'RE BUILT THEY'RE ACTUALLY GETTING. THE SECOND HOSPITALS. BILL NOW THEY HAVE. TO HAVE THE THEY HAVE TO GO THROUGH. THE STATE TO DO -- MEDI CAL WAIVER. TO ALLOW THE INSTITUTE [inaudible] FOR WHATEVER. SEC RULE THAT YOU CAN'T HAVE A HOSPITAL. OVER TWELVE PATIENTS RIGHT RULE [inaudible] HELLO [inaudible] NOW THANK YOU ARE THANK YOU ARE AWESOME I WOULD [inaudible] THANK YOU -- WE HAVE MANY COMMENT FROM EITHER LA YOUR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ON RIGHT WE'RE GOING TO GO TO PUBLIC COMMENT THEN ON THIS ITEM AND THEN WE'LL GO TO OUR LAST NIGHT.
