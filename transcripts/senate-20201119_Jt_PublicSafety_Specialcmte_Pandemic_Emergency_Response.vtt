RESPONDS COMMITTEE. SO WE KNOW

00:05:34.367 --> 00:05:36.436
THAT ONCE THE VIRUS. WHAT THE

00:05:36.502 --> 00:05:38.604
FIRST INCIDENCES OF THE VIRUS

00:05:38.671 --> 00:05:40.940
IN OUR STATE PRISONS IT SPREAD

00:05:41.007 --> 00:05:44.210
RAPIDLY AND THAT SPREAD WHILE

00:05:44.277 --> 00:05:46.145
THERE WERE MANY ACTIONS THAT

00:05:46.212 --> 00:05:48.381
WERE TAKEN SUCH AS STOPPING THE

00:05:48.448 --> 00:05:51.417
TRANSFER FROM US FOLKS WHO WERE

00:05:51.484 --> 00:05:53.219
IN COUNTY JAIL INTO THE STATE

PRISON SO WE WERE NOT CREATING

00:05:55.455 --> 00:05:59.392
TRANSMISSION THAT WAY. ALSO

00:05:59.459 --> 00:06:01.094
DOING A VARIETY OF THINGS TO

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:03.663
TRY TO LIMIT THE REALITY IS

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:05.498
THAT THERE ARE SO MANY STAFF

00:06:05.565 --> 00:06:06.933
WITHIN OUR STATE FACILITIES

00:06:06.999 --> 00:06:09.335
THAT GO IN AND OUT IN FACT AND

00:06:09.402 --> 00:06:12.271
A DAILY BASIS. THAT WE HAVE

00:06:12.338 --> 00:06:14.340
SEEN AND CONTINUE TO SEE IT

00:06:14.407 --> 00:06:17.110
UNFORTUNATELY VERY RAPID SPREAD

00:06:17.176 --> 00:06:19.011
OF THIS VIRUS WITHIN OUR STATE

00:06:19.078 --> 00:06:22.482
FACILITIES AND NOW THAT WE HAVE

00:06:22.548 --> 00:06:24.317
GREAT THESE VERY SIGNIFICANT

00:06:24.383 --> 00:06:26.319
NUMBERS OF VIRUS THROUGHOUT THE

00:06:26.385 --> 00:06:29.322
STATE AT HIGHER NUMBERS PER DAY

00:06:29.388 --> 00:06:30.289
AND WE HAVE SEEN EVEN AT THE

00:06:30.356 --> 00:06:33.292
PEAK. WE ARE LIKELY TO SEE

00:06:33.359 --> 00:06:36.529
SIMILAR WITHIN OUR FACILITIES-

00:06:36.596 --> 00:06:40.867
AND I THINK THAT WHILE- NO THAT

00:06:40.933 --> 00:06:42.969
WAS NOT OUR PRIMARY. REASON FOR

00:06:43.035 --> 00:06:44.771
GOING HEARING WE REALLY WANTED

00:06:44.837 --> 00:06:46.038
TO DO OVERSIGHT ON THIS IN

00:06:46.105 --> 00:06:48.241
GENERAL I THINK WE REALLY DO

00:06:48.307 --> 00:06:50.743
HAVE TO LOOK AT THE FACT THAT.

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:51.711
IT IS SEARCHING THROUGHOUT THE

00:06:51.778 --> 00:06:55.515
STATE AND IT REQUIRES A WHOLE I

00:06:55.581 --> 00:06:57.450
FEEL A WHOLE NEW LEVEL OF

00:06:57.517 --> 00:06:59.819
DILIGENCE AND PERHAPS NEW

00:06:59.886 --> 00:07:01.954
PROTOCOLS ARE ACTIONS TO

00:07:02.021 --> 00:07:03.356
PROTECT THOSE PEOPLE THAT WE

00:07:03.422 --> 00:07:05.291
HOLD IN OUR STATE FACILITY SO I

00:07:05.358 --> 00:07:06.959
LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING FROM.

00:07:07.026 --> 00:07:10.229
THE PANELISTS FROM THE PUBLIC-

00:07:10.296 --> 00:07:12.965
TO GIVE US THE ABILITY TO

00:07:13.032 --> 00:07:14.534
FIGURE OUT IF WE ARE TAKING THE

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:16.402
APPROPRIATE STEPS OR WHAT OTHER

00:07:16.469 --> 00:07:18.237
STEPS WE MIGHT MAKE AND THEN I

00:07:18.304 --> 00:07:20.206
KNOW IN THE SECOND PANEL WE ARE

00:07:20.273 --> 00:07:21.707

MEN'S COLONY BECAUSE IT WAS AN

00:28:02.947 --> 00:28:04.516
EXAMPLE OF A SUCCESSFUL

00:28:04.582 --> 00:28:06.951
CONTAINMENT OF AN OUTBREAK AND

00:28:07.018 --> 00:28:07.519
THAT COULD SERVE AS A BEST

00:28:07.585 --> 00:28:09.454
PRACTICE FOR OTHER PRISONS

00:28:09.521 --> 00:28:10.388
WE'VE BEEN PROVIDING TECHNICAL

00:28:10.455 --> 00:28:11.623
ADVICE TO THE CDC OUR

00:28:11.689 --> 00:28:13.658
LEADERSHIP ON AN AD HOC BASIS

00:28:13.725 --> 00:28:14.759
AND WE'RE STARTING NOW A NEW

00:28:14.826 --> 00:28:16.094
PROJECT TO BETTER UNDERSTAND

00:28:16.161 --> 00:28:17.695
COVERT NINETEEN TRANSMISSION

00:28:17.762 --> 00:28:19.497
WITHIN THE PRISONS TAKING INTO

00:28:19.564 --> 00:28:20.832
ACCOUNT NOT ONLY THE MITIGATION

00:28:20.899 --> 00:28:21.666
STRATEGIES THAT HAVE BEEN

00:28:21.733 --> 00:28:23.435
DISCUSSED BUT ALSO THE PHYSICAL

00:28:23.501 --> 00:28:25.670
CHARACTERISTICS OF EACH PRESENT

00:28:25.737 --> 00:28:27.238
AND HOW THEY INCREASE OR

00:28:27.305 --> 00:28:30.475
DECREASE SUSCEPTIBILITY. TO

00:28:30.542 --> 00:28:31.643
TRANSMISSION. WHAT ARE OF OUR

00:28:31.709 --> 00:28:33.311
THOUGHTS ABOUT HOW TO PREPARE

00:28:33.378 --> 00:28:34.412
FOR THE NEXT PHASE OF THE UP.

00:28:34.479 --> 00:28:36.614
BUT OF THE PANDEMIC. NUMBER

00:28:36.681 --> 00:28:38.716
ONE. BUT JUST TO UNDERLINE WHAT

00:28:38.783 --> 00:28:40.618
WE JUST HEARD FROM MISTER KING.

00:28:40.685 --> 00:28:41.553
WE CONTINUE TO STRONGLY

00:28:41.619 --> 00:28:43.354
ADVOCATE FOR ACCELERATED

00:28:43.421 --> 00:28:45.423
RELEASE AND FOR LOW. THE RECENT

00:28:45.490 --> 00:28:47.325
EXPLOSIVE EPIDEMICS THAT WE'VE

00:28:47.392 --> 00:28:49.227
SEEN FOR EXAMPLE AT THE-

00:28:49.294 --> 00:28:51.496
CALIFORNIA SUBSTANCE ABUSE

00:28:51.563 --> 00:28:52.530
TREATMENT FACILITY AND OF HIGH

00:28:52.597 --> 00:28:55.200
DESERT. SHOW THAT WE CAN HAVE-

00:28:55.266 --> 00:28:57.902
NEW OUTBREAKS WITH HUNDREDS IN

00:28:57.969 --> 00:28:59.437
THE CASE OF THE SUBSTANCE ABUSE

00:28:59.504 --> 00:29:00.939
TREATMENT FACILITY ALMOST FIVE

00:29:01.005 --> 00:29:01.606
HUNDRED IN THE CASE OF HIGH

00:29:01.673 --> 00:29:03.541
DESERT. NO MORE THAN THREE

00:29:03.608 --> 00:29:04.142
HUNDRED JUST WITHIN THE LAST

00:29:04.209 --> 00:29:06.010
COUPLE OF WEEKS. BUT THE

00:29:06.077 --> 00:29:07.745
NUMBERS OF PEOPLE THAT WE HAVE

00:29:07.812 --> 00:29:09.514
IN LARGE CONGREGATE SETTINGS IN

00:29:09.581 --> 00:29:11.182
THE PRISONS. ARE NOT ABLE TO BE

00:29:11.249 --> 00:29:13.251
PROTECTED AND WE NEED MANY MORE

00:29:13.318 --> 00:29:14.752
PEOPLE TO BE RELEASED TO BE

00:29:14.819 --> 00:29:16.054
ABLE TO KEEP THOSE WHO MUST

00:29:16.121 --> 00:29:18.456
STAY INSIDE. SAFE FROM THESE

00:29:18.523 --> 00:29:21.159
KIND OF EXPLOSIVE. OUTBREAKS

00:29:21.226 --> 00:29:23.261
SECONDLY WE NEED TO DO A BETTER

00:29:23.328 --> 00:29:24.929
JOB OF COWORKING IMAGINE A

00:29:24.996 --> 00:29:25.864
NURSING HOME THAT INSTEAD OF

00:29:25.930 --> 00:29:28.633
HAVING A HUNDRED RESIDENTS HAD

00:29:28.700 --> 00:29:30.535
FOUR THOUSAND RESIDENTS. BY

00:29:30.602 --> 00:29:32.137
TAKING A PRISON A LARGE PRISON

00:29:32.203 --> 00:29:33.338
AND SUBDIVIDING IT SO THAT

00:29:33.404 --> 00:29:35.173
FUNCTIONALLY IT'S A NUMBER OF

00:29:35.240 --> 00:29:36.975
SMALLER PRISONS. YOU REDUCE THE

00:29:37.041 --> 00:29:38.309
ABILITY TO HAVE A SMALL

00:29:38.376 --> 00:29:39.844
OUTBREAK TURN INTO AN EXPLOSIVE

00:29:39.911 --> 00:29:41.779
OUTBREAK LIKE LIKE WE'VE SEEN

00:29:41.846 --> 00:29:43.381
IN SEVERAL PRISONS. WE NEED TO

00:29:43.448 --> 00:29:44.983
DO THAT BY KEEPING BOTH

00:29:45.049 --> 00:29:48.920
RESIDENTS AND STAFF. ASSIGNED

00:29:48.987 --> 00:29:49.554
TO THEIR MANY PRISON WITHIN THE

00:29:49.621 --> 00:29:51.823
PRISON. THE NOW. THIRDLY AS

00:29:51.890 --> 00:29:53.057
MENTIONED BY DOCTOR BACK WE'RE

00:29:53.124 --> 00:29:54.425
VERY EXCITED ABOUT THE ADVENT

00:29:54.492 --> 00:29:56.294
OF THE NEW VACCINES IN THE

00:29:56.361 --> 00:29:57.128
EFFECTIVENESS THAT THEY SEEM TO

00:29:57.195 --> 00:29:59.631
HAVE. AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE

00:29:59.697 --> 00:30:02.333
THAT- CALIFORNIA PRISON STAFF

00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:03.801
AND RESIDENTS ARE PRIORITIZED

00:30:03.868 --> 00:30:04.636
FOR THE VACCINES THAT

00:30:04.702 --> 00:30:06.471
CALIFORNIA HAS ACCESS TO. MY

00:30:06.538 --> 00:30:08.239
WITH A SPECIALLY UNDERLINED THE

00:30:08.306 --> 00:30:10.341
NEED FOR STAFF TO BE VACCINATED

00:30:10.408 --> 00:30:11.142
BECAUSE AS WE'VE HEARD FROM

00:30:11.209 --> 00:30:13.344
OTHER SPEAKERS. IT'S STAFF WILL

00:30:13.411 --> 00:30:14.812
PROVIDE THE VEHICLE OF

00:30:14.879 --> 00:30:16.080
INTRODUCTION OF THE VIRUS INTO

00:30:16.147 --> 00:30:17.081
THE PRISONS. THAT GETS

00:30:17.148 --> 00:30:18.917
AMPLIFIED AND EXPLOSIVELY

00:30:18.983 --> 00:30:20.885
WITHIN THE PRISON AND THEN IS A

00:30:20.952 --> 00:30:22.554
DANGER TO THE COMMUNITY BOTH

00:30:22.620 --> 00:30:23.988
BECAUSE OF TRANSMISSION BACK

00:30:24.055 --> 00:30:24.989
OUT TO THE COMMUNITY. AND

00:30:25.056 --> 00:30:27.458
BECAUSE OF OVERWHELMING LOCAL

00:30:27.525 --> 00:30:29.427
HEALTH CARE RESOURCES. SO WE

00:30:29.494 --> 00:30:30.895
STRONGLY ENCOURAGED THAT THERE

00:30:30.962 --> 00:30:31.796
SOMEBODY IS REPRESENTING

00:30:31.863 --> 00:30:33.631
CORRECTIONS ON THE GOVERNOR'S

00:30:33.698 --> 00:30:35.533
FAXING PREPOSITION TASK FORCE.

00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:36.834
AND WE'RE ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT

00:30:36.901 --> 00:30:38.503
THE ACCEPTANCE OF VACCINATION

00:30:38.570 --> 00:30:42.106
AMONG BOTH- STAFF AND-

00:30:42.173 --> 00:30:43.875
RESIDENTS OF THE PRISONS AND SO

00:30:43.942 --> 00:30:44.676
WE THINK IT'S EXTREMELY

00:30:44.742 --> 00:30:46.044
IMPORTANT WE WILL CONTRIBUTE TO

00:30:46.110 --> 00:30:47.812
WORKING WITH INMATES COUNCIL'S

00:30:47.879 --> 00:30:49.247
FAMILY COMMUNITY PARTNERS AS

00:30:49.314 --> 00:30:50.848
WELL AS THE UNIONS. TO TRY TO

00:30:50.915 --> 00:30:52.617
REDUCE ANY RELUCTANCE TO BE

00:30:52.684 --> 00:30:55.486
VACCINATED- IN THE CASE OF- THE

00:30:55.553 --> 00:30:56.988
UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA SYSTEM

00:30:57.055 --> 00:30:58.022
WIDE WE HAVE RECENTLY

00:30:58.089 --> 00:31:00.491
INSTITUTED AN OBLIGATORY

00:31:00.558 --> 00:31:02.260
INFLUENZA VACCINATION POLICY I

00:31:02.327 --> 00:31:03.494
CAN'T GO TO CAMPUS IF I'M NOT

00:31:03.561 --> 00:31:05.129
BACK SENATE AGAINST INFLUENZA.

00:31:05.196 --> 00:31:06.264
AND IT SEEMS TO ME THAT WE GOT

00:31:06.331 --> 00:31:08.533
A MINIMUM SHOULD DO THE SAME

00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:09.701
FOR THE STAFF AT WORKING IN OUR

00:31:09.767 --> 00:31:12.036
PRISONS BECAUSE WITH INFLUENZA

00:31:12.103 --> 00:31:14.038
AND HOPEFULLY SOON COVERT

00:31:14.105 --> 00:31:15.640
VACCINATION WILL BE ABLE TO

00:31:15.707 --> 00:31:17.875
PROTECT THE POPULATION IN THE

00:31:17.942 --> 00:31:20.645
PRISONS. ALMOST LASTLY I WANT

00:31:20.712 --> 00:31:22.714
TO MENTION. THAT DR BIG BIG

00:31:22.780 --> 00:31:23.815
MENTION THAT HE'S HAVING A

00:31:23.881 --> 00:31:25.316
BETTER TIME NOW WITH THE TURN

00:31:25.383 --> 00:31:26.618
AROUND TIME ON TESTS BUT THAT

00:31:26.684 --> 00:31:28.519
HAS BEEN A MAJOR PROBLEM. AND

00:31:28.586 --> 00:31:29.821
WITH THE SURGE IS HAPPENING IN

00:31:29.887 --> 00:31:31.589
CALIFORNIA I'M VERY CONCERNED.

00:31:31.656 --> 00:31:33.224
THAT THE TURNAROUND TIME WILL

00:31:33.291 --> 00:31:35.426
FALL. IT'S INEXCUSABLE AROUND

00:31:35.493 --> 00:31:36.561
HAVE LONG TURNAROUND TIME FOR

00:31:36.628 --> 00:31:37.495
TESTING IT'S BETTER TO HAVE

00:31:37.562 --> 00:31:39.330
LESS TESTING IN THE COMMUNITY.

00:31:39.397 --> 00:31:40.565
THAT HAVE WEEK LONG TURNAROUND

00:31:40.632 --> 00:31:41.866
TIMES BECAUSE IF YOU HAVE A

00:31:41.933 --> 00:31:43.701
LONG TURNAROUND TIME. YOU CAN'T

00:31:43.768 --> 00:31:45.036
TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE RESULTS

00:31:45.103 --> 00:31:45.970
OF THE TEST TO INTERRUPT

00:31:46.037 --> 00:31:47.705
TRANSMISSION AND THAT'S WHY

00:31:47.772 --> 00:31:48.773
WE'RE DOING THE TESTING FOR. IN

00:31:48.840 --> 00:31:50.942
MOST CASES SO WE NEED IT

00:31:51.009 --> 00:31:52.910
BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT. THESE

00:31:52.977 --> 00:31:54.245
EPIDEMICS AND OUTBREAKS HAPPEN

00:31:54.312 --> 00:31:55.847
EXPLOSIVELY WITHIN PRISONS WE

00:31:55.913 --> 00:31:57.715
NEED TO PRIORITIZE THE PRISONS

00:31:57.782 --> 00:32:00.251
FOR RAPID RESPONSE- FROM THE TO

00:32:00.318 --> 00:32:02.287
THE TESTING SERVICES. THANK YOU

00:32:02.353 --> 00:32:03.988
CAN FINALLY I WANT TO MENTION

00:32:04.055 --> 00:32:04.822
SOMETHING THAT'S ALREADY BEEN

00:32:04.889 --> 00:32:07.025
MENTIONED I WAS VERY VERY HAPPY

00:32:07.091 --> 00:32:07.892
TO HEAR TODAY ABOUT THE NEW

00:32:07.959 --> 00:32:09.294
TABLET PROGRAM WE'VE BEEN

00:32:09.360 --> 00:32:10.828
ADVOCATING FOR THAT. IT'S

00:32:10.895 --> 00:32:12.764
REALLY IMPORTANT FOR PEOPLE IN

00:32:12.830 --> 00:32:14.365
OUR PRISONS TO NOT LOSE CONTACT

00:32:14.432 --> 00:32:15.967
WITH THEIR FAMILIES TO MAINTAIN

00:32:16.034 --> 00:32:17.468
THEIR MENTAL HEALTH BUT ALSO TO

00:32:17.535 --> 00:32:19.437
MAINTAIN. THEIR COOPERATION

00:32:19.504 --> 00:32:23.308
WITH- PP AND- SOCIAL

00:32:23.374 --> 00:32:25.743
DISTANCING. AND SO- THE TABLET

00:32:25.810 --> 00:32:27.512
PROGRAM WILL GO A LONG WAY. BUT

00:32:27.578 --> 00:32:29.447
IT'S ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT FOR

00:32:29.514 --> 00:32:31.416

WHEN THAT HAPPENS ISOLATION

00:32:42.226 --> 00:32:44.095
QUARANTINE IS NOT PUNITIVE. BUT

00:32:44.162 --> 00:32:45.396
THEY WILL HAVE IF ANYTHING

00:32:45.463 --> 00:32:47.365

00:47:19.903 --> 00:47:24.041
THANKS SO MUCH I'M- SO IT JUST

00:47:24.107 --> 00:47:26.143
HIT THE CDCR STAFF MS GIBSON

00:47:26.210 --> 00:47:27.978
AND DR BECK I'M PLEASED TO HEAR

00:47:28.045 --> 00:47:29.580
THAT CDCR IS LOOKING AT

00:47:29.646 --> 00:47:33.183
RESTORING ACCESS TO- FAMILY AND

00:47:33.250 --> 00:47:35.252
OTHER VISITATION THOUGH REMOTE

00:47:35.319 --> 00:47:36.720
BY VIRTUALLY AS WE ARE DOING

00:47:36.787 --> 00:47:39.690
HERE FOR MANY OF US- AND

00:47:39.756 --> 00:47:41.925
LOOKING RE RE LOOKING AGAIN OF

00:47:41.992 --> 00:47:43.727
PROGRAMMING SO THOSE GOOD

00:47:43.794 --> 00:47:45.462
HOWEVER IT SEEMS TO ME RIGHT

00:47:45.529 --> 00:47:47.698
NOW THAT THE MOST ESSENTIAL

00:47:47.764 --> 00:47:49.066
THING IS TO GET THE VIRUS UNDER

00:47:49.132 --> 00:47:51.468
CONTROL AND I WOULD POINTS TO

00:47:51.535 --> 00:47:54.404
THOSE WHO. MAY BE- OBSERVING

00:47:54.471 --> 00:47:55.372
THIS HEARING OR PARTICIPATING

00:47:55.439 --> 00:47:57.241
IN THIS HEARING THAT CDC OURS

00:47:57.307 --> 00:48:01.545
OWN WEBSITE HAS A TRACKER ON-

00:48:01.612 --> 00:48:04.815
THAT SHOWS COULD BE CASES AND

00:48:04.881 --> 00:48:07.584
COMPARES THOSE CODE CASES TO

00:48:07.651 --> 00:48:09.920
THE NUMBER PER CAPITA WITHIN

00:48:09.987 --> 00:48:11.655
OUR FACILITIES THE NUMBER PER

00:48:11.722 --> 00:48:13.824
AND THEN THE NUMBER OF CASES IN

00:48:13.890 --> 00:48:16.360
CALIFORNIA PER CAPITA IN THE

00:48:16.426 --> 00:48:18.862
NUMBER OF CASES IN THE COUNTRY-

00:48:18.929 --> 00:48:20.530
AND AS MR KING POINTED OUT

00:48:20.597 --> 00:48:22.866
SINCE OUR HEARING IN JULY WHICH

00:48:22.933 --> 00:48:25.902
WAS PROMPTED BY THE DISASTROUS

00:48:25.969 --> 00:48:27.804
TRANSFERRED CHIU SANDPOINT

00:48:27.871 --> 00:48:29.706
WHICH I'M LEAST A VERY

00:48:29.773 --> 00:48:31.375
SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF CASES IN

00:48:31.441 --> 00:48:33.143
STATE COURT. AND UP TO THAT

00:48:33.210 --> 00:48:35.045
POINT YES WE HAD CASES IN A FEW

00:48:35.112 --> 00:48:37.914
FACILITIES BUT AND IF THE ANTI

00:48:37.981 --> 00:48:40.050
VIRUS WAS DEFINITELY SPREADING

00:48:40.117 --> 00:48:45.422
BUT. IT BECAME ALMOST- FIVE YOU

00:48:45.489 --> 00:48:46.890
KNOW THE DISTRICT MASS. AT THE

00:48:46.957 --> 00:48:49.393
POINT NOW CERTAIN SOME OF

00:48:49.459 --> 00:48:51.361
MEASURE WERE TAKEN I DO NOT

00:48:51.428 --> 00:48:53.463
MINIMIZE THE ACT HOWEVER WE ARE

00:48:53.530 --> 00:48:55.132
NOW IN A SITUATION WHERE IN

00:48:55.198 --> 00:48:56.900
THOSE FOUR MONTHS AS WAS

00:48:56.967 --> 00:48:58.568
POINTED OUT. WHERE WE HAD THAT

00:48:58.635 --> 00:49:00.904
HEARING THERE HAVE BEEN OVER

00:49:00.971 --> 00:49:03.206
ELEVEN THOUSAND. NEW CASES. AND

00:49:03.273 --> 00:49:06.710
IF WE LOOK JUST TODAY CLOSE TO

00:49:06.777 --> 00:49:07.978
SIXTEEN HUNDRED NEW CASES SO

00:49:08.045 --> 00:49:10.981
THAT WE HAVE A HUNDRED AND

00:49:11.048 --> 00:49:13.817
EIGHTY TWO CASES. PER ONE

00:49:13.884 --> 00:49:14.284
THOUSAND INCARCERATED

00:49:14.351 --> 00:49:16.286
INDIVIDUALS NOW LET'S COMPARE

00:49:16.353 --> 00:49:17.621
THAT WE KNOW THERE'S A SURGEON

00:49:17.688 --> 00:49:20.223
A REST OF THE STATE. HOWEVER

00:49:20.290 --> 00:49:22.392
FOR THE STATE IT'S TWENTY SIX

00:49:22.459 --> 00:49:24.628
CASES PER ONE THOUSAND AND THE

00:49:24.695 --> 00:49:25.996
REST OF THE US WHICH IS WORST

00:49:26.063 --> 00:49:29.566
IN CALIFORNIA IT'S THIRTY FOUR.

00:49:29.633 --> 00:49:30.967
ONE EIGHTY TWO TO A THOUSAND

00:49:31.034 --> 00:49:31.568
VERSUS THIRTY FOUR TO A

00:49:31.635 --> 00:49:36.106
THOUSAND. THAT IS. IN A- I FEEL

00:49:36.173 --> 00:49:39.810
AND I'M- NUMBER. SO WE NEED

00:49:39.876 --> 00:49:42.346
MUCH BETTER CONTROL AND WHILE I

00:49:42.412 --> 00:49:45.015
APPRECIATE THAT ARE WE HEARD

00:49:45.082 --> 00:49:47.617
FROM THAT THERE'S- ATTENTION TO

00:49:47.684 --> 00:49:49.753
THE MASKING FORSMAN. WE WERE

00:49:49.820 --> 00:49:52.289
TOLD IN JULY. THAT THE MASK

00:49:52.356 --> 00:49:54.257
PROTOCOL IS BEING ENFORCED AND

00:49:54.324 --> 00:49:55.992
YET HERE TODAY WE HEAR THAT

00:49:56.059 --> 00:49:57.694
EVEN IN HELLO CAN BAY THERE

00:49:57.761 --> 00:49:59.730
WHAT YOU MENTION OVER TEN

00:49:59.796 --> 00:50:02.999
INCIDENTS THAT OF LACK OF MAC

00:50:03.066 --> 00:50:05.001
MAC NOT THAT THEY WERE ENFORCED

00:50:05.068 --> 00:50:07.170
THE WORK BUT WHERE IT STAFF

00:50:07.237 --> 00:50:09.373
WERE NOT COMPLYING. SO IF WE

00:50:09.439 --> 00:50:11.842
NEED THAT MUCH TIME WE ARE

00:50:11.908 --> 00:50:12.409
STILL HAVING THAT LEVEL OF

00:50:12.476 --> 00:50:15.946
INCIDENTS OF NON COMPLIANCE ACT

00:50:16.012 --> 00:50:17.714
WHEN WE KNOW THAT IT'S THE

00:50:17.781 --> 00:50:19.716
EXTRA IT'S THE STAFF THAT ARE

00:50:19.783 --> 00:50:20.484
BRINGING THE VIRUS IN AND I

00:50:20.550 --> 00:50:22.519
DON'T SEE THAT TO BE CRUEL TO

00:50:22.586 --> 00:50:26.189
STAFF. IS JUST THE REALITY THAT

00:50:26.256 --> 00:50:28.291
IF YOU'RE- IN IF YOU ARE IN THE

00:50:28.358 --> 00:50:29.693
CONGREGATE FACILITY AND NOT

00:50:29.760 --> 00:50:31.428
GOING IN AND OUT YOU ARE NOT

00:50:31.495 --> 00:50:34.164
BRINGING. THE VIRUS IN IT IS

00:50:34.231 --> 00:50:36.266
ONLY DOES PEOPLE GOING IN AND

00:50:36.333 --> 00:50:39.536
OUT SO I'M NOT TRYING TO. MAKE

00:50:39.603 --> 00:50:40.971
I'M NOT TRYING TO CREATE A BALL

00:50:41.037 --> 00:50:42.839
SIGNED STAFF RATHER JUST THE

00:50:42.906 --> 00:50:46.243
FACT. SO I WANT TO HEAR FROM

00:50:46.309 --> 00:50:51.815
BOTH MS GIBSON AND DR BECK. I'D

00:50:51.882 --> 00:50:54.151
LIKE TO HAVE IT I AM NOT HAPPY

00:50:54.217 --> 00:50:55.752
ABOUT THESE NUMBERS AND I WOULD

LIKE TO HEAR MORE ABOUT THE

00:50:57.754 --> 00:50:59.322
ENFORCEMENT AND THEN I HAVE

00:50:59.389 --> 00:51:03.360
THREE OTHER QUESTIONS. SO WIRD

00:51:03.427 --> 00:51:06.029
DR PICKED ONE TAKE AT FIRST AND

00:51:06.096 --> 00:51:09.232
THEN THE THIS GIPSON. I SHARE

00:51:09.299 --> 00:51:11.001
YOUR FRUSTRATION SENATOR AND

00:51:11.067 --> 00:51:12.169
THIS IS KIND OF PARTICULARLY

00:51:12.235 --> 00:51:13.870
FRUSTRATING YEAR FOR ALL OF US

00:51:13.937 --> 00:51:15.539
IN PUBLIC HEALTH I DON'T THINK

00:51:15.605 --> 00:51:17.941
I'VE EVER SEEN BASIC SCIENCE

00:51:18.008 --> 00:51:19.009
PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUES

00:51:19.075 --> 00:51:20.477
POLITICIZED IN A WAY THAT

00:51:20.544 --> 00:51:22.579
HAPPENED THIS YEAR. AND WHEN WE

00:51:22.646 --> 00:51:24.714
HAVE SUCH AN EXTRAORDINARY

00:51:24.781 --> 00:51:26.550
PERCENTAGE OF OUR POPULATION

00:51:26.616 --> 00:51:28.552
TAKING THEIR LEAD FROM ELECTED

00:51:28.618 --> 00:51:30.353
FOLKS TO SAY THAT BASICALLY THE

00:51:30.420 --> 00:51:32.856
VIRUSES A HOAX AND- MASKS MAKE

00:51:32.923 --> 00:51:34.858
YOU SICK. ANDERSON INFRINGEMENT

00:51:34.925 --> 00:51:36.893
ON YOUR PERSONAL LIBERTIES IT'S

00:51:36.960 --> 00:51:38.662
ONLY MADE OUR JOB ALL THE MORE

00:51:38.728 --> 00:51:41.465
DIFFICULT THAT BEING SAID. IT'S

00:51:41.531 --> 00:51:43.867
AN EXPECTATION OF ALL OF OUR

00:51:43.934 --> 00:51:44.601
EMPLOYEES THAT THEY WILL WEAR

00:51:44.668 --> 00:51:49.439
THEM. SECRETARY ALISON AND-

00:51:49.506 --> 00:51:51.475
RECEIVER MR KELSO ME THAT

00:51:51.541 --> 00:51:53.443
EXQUISITELY CLEAR AND AS CONNIE

00:51:53.510 --> 00:51:54.978
GIBSON DIRECTOR GIBSON JUST

00:51:55.045 --> 00:51:56.713
POINTED OUT. WE ARE GETTING

00:51:56.780 --> 00:51:58.415
EVEN MORE ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN

00:51:58.482 --> 00:51:59.950
ENSURING THAT EMPLOYEES WHO

00:52:00.016 --> 00:52:01.518
CHOOSE TO NOT FOLLOW THAT

00:52:01.585 --> 00:52:03.553
DIRECTIVE WILL EXPERIENCE

00:52:03.620 --> 00:52:05.455
PROGRESSIVE DISCIPLINE. THE

00:52:05.522 --> 00:52:07.224
OTHER FACTOR THAT WE FOUND

00:52:07.290 --> 00:52:08.692
THROUGH OUR TOURISM FACILITIES

00:52:08.758 --> 00:52:10.794
AS WHAT WASBEING USED AS FACE

00:52:10.861 --> 00:52:12.796
COVERINGS VARIED SIGNIFICANTLY

00:52:12.863 --> 00:52:14.731
ALL OVER THE STATE. AND WE SAW

00:52:14.798 --> 00:52:16.566
THAT IS A SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE

00:52:16.633 --> 00:52:18.335
IN A PROBLEM. PEOPLE WEARING

00:52:18.401 --> 00:52:20.537
BANDANNAS AND GATORS AND MASKS

00:52:20.604 --> 00:52:22.405
WITH VALVES AND ALL TYPES OF

00:52:22.472 --> 00:52:24.074
THINGS THAT ARE NOT REALLY

00:52:24.140 --> 00:52:26.176
GOING TO ACHIEVE OUR GOAL AND

00:52:26.243 --> 00:52:27.911
SO RECENTLY THE DECISION WAS

00:52:27.978 --> 00:52:29.746
MADE AND IS BEING IMPLEMENTED

00:52:29.813 --> 00:52:31.615
THAT ALL OF OUR EMPLOYEES WILL

00:52:31.681 --> 00:52:36.453
BE REQUIRED TO WEAR. THIS TYPE

00:52:36.520 --> 00:52:38.688
OF. COVERAGE IT'S MORE. IT'S

00:52:38.755 --> 00:52:40.390
STANDARD WILL BE MUCH EASIER

00:52:40.457 --> 00:52:41.958
AUDIT OUR STAFF AS WE ARE IN.

00:52:42.025 --> 00:52:42.692
FROM SURE THAT EVERYBODY

00:52:42.759 --> 00:52:44.661
WEARING THEM THEY'LL BE

00:52:44.728 --> 00:52:45.862
PROVIDED FREE OF CHARGE TO

00:52:45.929 --> 00:52:48.265
EMPLOYEES. AND I THINK BY DOING

00:52:48.331 --> 00:52:50.133
SO WE'RE GOING TO ACHIEVE. A

00:52:50.200 --> 00:52:52.736
BETTER COMPLIANCE THE LAST

00:52:52.802 --> 00:52:53.737
THING I WOULD SAY IS. BEING

00:52:53.803 --> 00:52:56.039
DISTRIBUTED BUT IT WILL BE

00:52:56.106 --> 00:52:58.308
DISTRIBUTED TO EVERY EMPLOYEE

00:52:58.375 --> 00:53:01.811
TO PER SHIFT AS THIS ROLLS OUT.

00:53:01.878 --> 00:53:02.779
AND THE LAST THING I WOULD

00:53:02.846 --> 00:53:05.649
WORRY AS IT ROLLS OUT WHEN. I

00:53:05.715 --> 00:53:07.551
BELIEVE THE NINE MEMBERS BEING

00:53:07.617 --> 00:53:09.886
SIGNED THIS WEEK- THERE WAS A

00:53:09.953 --> 00:53:11.221
LOT THAT WENT INTO MAKING SURE

00:53:11.288 --> 00:53:13.323
WE HAVE ADEQUATE SUPPLY THAT WE

00:53:13.390 --> 00:53:14.658
CAN HAVE HIM AVAILABLE AT EVERY

00:53:14.724 --> 00:53:18.094
INSTITUTION. BEING SIGNED THIS

00:53:18.161 --> 00:53:19.930
IT COULD STILL BE TWO WEEKS

00:53:19.996 --> 00:53:23.199
BEFORE STAFF RECEIVE THE MASKS.

00:53:23.266 --> 00:53:24.534
I DON'T BELIEVE SO I'LL DEFER

00:53:24.601 --> 00:53:26.570
TO CONNIE FOR THE SPECIFICS ON

00:53:26.636 --> 00:53:30.840
THE ROLL OUT. YOU KNOW ONCE THE

00:53:30.907 --> 00:53:32.709
MEMO IS SIGN THAT WOULD BE THE

00:53:32.776 --> 00:53:33.777
EXPECTATION THAT WE IMPLEMENT A

00:53:33.843 --> 00:53:35.145
MEET ELAINE SO WE'VE ALREADY

00:53:35.211 --> 00:53:37.781
BEEN SHIPPING A SURGICAL MASKS

00:53:37.847 --> 00:53:39.516
OF SUPPLIES TO THE PRISONS

00:53:39.583 --> 00:53:41.184
BECAUSE WE WERE PREPARING FOR

00:53:41.251 --> 00:53:42.686
THAT SO. THEY WILL BE READY TO

00:53:42.752 --> 00:53:45.789
GO ONCE THE MEMORANDUM IS THE

00:53:45.855 --> 00:53:48.692
SOFTEST SIGNED AND DISTRIBUTED.

00:53:48.758 --> 00:53:50.160
RIGHT YOU CAN- POLITICIAN

00:53:50.226 --> 00:53:52.162
CONTINUE. OWNER NO PROBLEM

00:53:52.228 --> 00:53:53.430
SENATOR AND I THINK THE ONLY

00:53:53.496 --> 00:53:54.664
LAST THING I WOULD SAY IS AS

00:53:54.731 --> 00:53:55.599
IMPORTANT AS THE SPACE

00:53:55.665 --> 00:53:57.567
COVERINGS ARE IT'S NOT GOING TO

00:53:57.634 --> 00:54:00.036
BE. PERFECT IT'S ONLY ONE OF

00:54:00.103 --> 00:54:01.871
MANY THINGS THAT WE NEED TO DO.

00:54:01.938 --> 00:54:03.006
AND THERE IS THIS NTURAL

00:54:03.073 --> 00:54:05.342
TENSION BETWEEN TRYING TO MAKE

00:54:05.408 --> 00:54:07.310
AVAILABLE TO OUR ALL OF OUR

00:54:07.377 --> 00:54:08.478
PATIENTS ALL OF THE THINGS

00:54:08.545 --> 00:54:10.547
THAT. ARE VALUABLE IN THE

00:54:10.614 --> 00:54:12.449
SYSTEM AND IN TERMS OF VISITORS

00:54:12.515 --> 00:54:14.017
HERE DURING ARTS PROJECT

00:54:14.084 --> 00:54:15.785
PROJECTS IN EDUCATION AND-

00:54:15.852 --> 00:54:17.420
GARDEN PROJECTS IN THE DARK

00:54:17.487 --> 00:54:19.389
PROGRAM IN THEATER IN WRITING

00:54:19.456 --> 00:54:20.156
ALL THOSE OTHER VALUABLE

00:54:20.223 --> 00:54:22.626
THINGS. ALL OF WHICH ARE

00:54:22.692 --> 00:54:24.127
ACCOMPANIED BY RISKS WOMEN'S

VOLUNTEERS ARE COMING INTO THE

00:54:25.695 --> 00:54:28.098
INSTITUTION. SO WE'RE TRYING TO

00:54:28.164 --> 00:54:29.399
STRIKE THAT BALANCE BETWEEN

00:54:29.466 --> 00:54:31.801
KEEPING OUR PATIENTS SAFE AND

00:54:31.868 --> 00:54:33.570
KEEPING THEM SO RESTRICTED.

00:54:33.637 --> 00:54:38.575
THAT THEIR QUALITY. OF LIFE IS

00:54:38.642 --> 00:54:41.177
EVEN FURTHER MINIMIZE. THANK

00:54:41.244 --> 00:54:44.848
YOU I- BY. I DON'T WANT TO SAY

00:54:44.914 --> 00:54:47.417
WELL. I'M GLAD THAT THERE WILL

00:54:47.484 --> 00:54:51.321
BE MASKS DISTRIBUTED I. IT'S

00:54:51.388 --> 00:54:52.889
NEVER TOO LATE BUT IT IS RATHER

00:54:52.956 --> 00:54:54.858
LATE AND ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE

00:54:54.924 --> 00:54:56.426
NUMBER OF CASES WE HAVE RIGHT

00:54:56.493 --> 00:54:59.829
NOW PER THOUSAND SO I JUST.

00:54:59.896 --> 00:55:01.398
IT'S DISAPPOINTING I WISH IT

00:55:01.464 --> 00:55:04.200
HAD HAPPENED EARLIER- THE NEXT

00:55:04.267 --> 00:55:06.069
QUESTION I HAVE IS THAT THIS IS

00:55:06.136 --> 00:55:07.704
BACK TO THIS ISSUE OF REVIEW OF

00:55:07.771 --> 00:55:10.006
THE MATTER MEDICALLY VULNERABLE

00:55:10.073 --> 00:55:12.275
MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT.

00:55:12.342 --> 00:55:14.911
CITIES HERE SELF IDENTIFIED

00:55:14.978 --> 00:55:17.213
SOME FORTY FOUR THOUSAND AND I

00:55:17.280 --> 00:55:18.281
AM MAY HAVE THAT NUMBER OF BUT

00:55:18.348 --> 00:55:20.750
IT WAS AND IT WAS IN A LARGE

00:55:20.817 --> 00:55:22.452
THOUSANDS TENS OF THOUSANDS OF

00:55:22.519 --> 00:55:23.953
INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS WHO

00:55:24.020 --> 00:55:25.221
ARE DETERMINED TO BE MEDICALLY

00:55:25.288 --> 00:55:27.791
VULNERABLE AND A LARGE SUBSET

00:55:27.857 --> 00:55:30.527
OF DOWN WERE ALSO DETERMINED TO

00:55:30.593 --> 00:55:32.896
BE. POTENTIALLY LOW RISK FOR

00:55:32.962 --> 00:55:34.998
VIOLENCE USING A RISK

00:55:35.065 --> 00:55:36.066
ASSESSMENT TOOL THAT CDC OUR

00:55:36.132 --> 00:55:38.234
HOUSE BUT MY UNDERSTANDING IS

00:55:38.301 --> 00:55:39.169
THAT ONCE THE REVIEW WAS

00:55:39.235 --> 00:55:41.771
COMPLETED ONLY FORTY FOUR WE'RE

00:55:41.838 --> 00:55:43.139
GIVING CONSIDERATION FOR

00:55:43.206 --> 00:55:45.542
RELEASE NOW WHY AT THE POINT

00:55:45.608 --> 00:55:47.310
WHERE WE HAVE THIS LEVEL OF

00:55:47.377 --> 00:55:51.314
INFECTION RATE. WOULD WE STILL

00:55:51.381 --> 00:55:52.649
RETAIN. SUCH A SICK. NUMBER OF

00:55:52.716 --> 00:55:55.285
MEDICALLY VULNERABLE.

00:55:55.351 --> 00:55:58.455
INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS- THAT

00:55:58.521 --> 00:56:00.824
HAVE LOW RISK FOR VIOLENCE OR

00:56:00.890 --> 00:56:03.993
RECIDIVISM. AND WE HAVE MUCH

00:56:04.060 --> 00:56:05.061
MORE THAN JUST THE

00:56:05.128 --> 00:56:05.762
COMPASSIONATE AND MEDICALLY

00:56:05.829 --> 00:56:08.364
PAROLE THINGS AT OUR AT OUR

00:56:08.431 --> 00:56:10.333
DISPOSAL THERE IS ELEVEN

00:56:10.400 --> 00:56:11.000
SEVENTY D. THERE'S THE

00:56:11.067 --> 00:56:12.535
GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE ORDER

00:56:12.602 --> 00:56:13.570
THERE ARE A VARIETY OF OTHER

00:56:13.636 --> 00:56:15.905
TOOLS THAT CDC OUR HOUSE AT ITS

00:56:15.972 --> 00:56:17.440
DISPOSAL. SO WHAT I WANT TO

00:56:17.507 --> 00:56:20.477
KNOW IS WHAT IS CDC ARE DOING

00:56:20.543 --> 00:56:22.679
TO RE LOOK AT THIS POPULATION

00:56:22.746 --> 00:56:24.347
OF MEDICALLY VULNERABLE LOW

00:56:24.414 --> 00:56:28.251
RISK LOW RISK FOR RECIDIVISM IN

00:56:28.318 --> 00:56:31.888
VIOLENCE INDIVIDUALS. DID YOU

00:56:31.955 --> 00:56:33.523
WANT TO DIRECT A QUESTION TO.

00:56:33.590 --> 00:56:36.092
EITHEREITHER CCAR'S OFFICIAL

00:56:36.159 --> 00:56:37.660
IN THAT FEELS COMPLETELY

00:56:37.727 --> 00:56:41.731
ARTISTIC ON THE DOCTOR DID YOU

00:56:41.798 --> 00:56:45.435
WANNA TAKE THAT ON FIRST. IT'S

00:56:45.502 --> 00:56:46.402
REALLY MORE A QUESTION I THINK

00:56:46.469 --> 00:56:48.138
FOR OUR CDC ARE COLLEAGUES IN

00:56:48.204 --> 00:56:49.272

RELEASED WE ARE EVALUATING

00:56:50.940 --> 00:56:52.675
PATIENTS WHO WE BELIEVE MEET

00:56:52.742 --> 00:56:55.345
THOSE CRITERIA IDENTIFYING THEM

00:56:55.411 --> 00:56:58.381
FROM A MEDICAL STANDPOINT. OKAY

00:56:58.448 --> 00:56:59.249

VULNERABLE POPULATION AND I'M

00:57:16.332 --> 00:57:17.400
NOT SURE OF THE NUMBERS THAT

00:57:17.467 --> 00:57:18.935
WERE RELEASED I WOULD HAVE TO

00:57:19.002 --> 00:57:19.502
GET THAT INFORMATION OFF OF

00:57:19.569 --> 00:57:21.571

FOR LOW RISK OFFENDERS- VERSUS

00:57:37.387 --> 00:57:39.155
MODERATE OR HIGH I WOULD HAVE

00:58:54.297 --> 00:58:55.698
OFF A QUARANTINE TRANSFERRED.

00:58:55.765 --> 00:58:57.267
WITHIN NINETY FIVE ON THE

RIGHT I MEAN IT DOESN'T UP I'M

00:59:13.883 --> 00:59:16.419
SORRY YOU INDICATED OXFORD

00:59:16.486 --> 00:59:18.421
TESTING SO IS THAT THAT WE

00:59:18.488 --> 00:59:20.990
CANNOT REQUIRE IT. I DON'T

00:59:21.057 --> 00:59:22.525
BELIEVE WE ARE FORCING ME TO

00:59:22.592 --> 00:59:24.127

00:59:24.193 --> 00:59:25.862
DOCTOR BACK. IS THAT CORRECT DR

BECK OKAY. CORRECT WE'RE NOT

00:59:29.899 --> 00:59:31.935
ACTUALLY FORCIBLY TESTING BUT

00:59:32.001 --> 00:59:33.202
FOR THOSE PATIENTS WHO DON'T

00:59:33.269 --> 00:59:38.007
KNOW. THEIR CORNERS WE NEED. IS

00:59:38.074 --> 00:59:40.243
THAT BECAUSE WE LEAGUE. SAY

00:59:40.310 --> 00:59:43.212
AGAIN YES SIR WE LEGALLY ARE

00:59:43.279 --> 00:59:47.684
PROHIBITED. THREE THREE WE

00:59:47.750 --> 00:59:48.851
WOULD HAVE TO GET A COURT ORDER

00:59:48.918 --> 00:59:50.520
TO FORCE TEST THEM BUT IT'S NOT

00:59:50.586 --> 00:59:52.188
REQUIRED SO WE HAVE WE WILL

00:59:52.255 --> 00:59:53.823
EITHER TEST THEM AND IF THEY

00:59:53.890 --> 00:59:55.625
DON'T THEN THEIR QUARANTINE IS

00:59:55.692 --> 00:59:57.460
PROLONGED BUT WE DO NOT REDUCE

00:59:57.527 --> 00:59:59.228
THEM OUT IF THEY'RE UNSAFE I

00:59:59.295 --> 01:00:01.130
WOULD SAY. THAT THE PATIENTS AT

01:00:01.197 --> 01:00:02.832
SAN QUENTIN ARE PROBABLY AT

01:00:02.899 --> 01:00:04.000
THIS TIME AMONG THE SAFEST TO

01:00:04.067 --> 01:00:05.902
TRANSFER BECAUSE MANY OF THEM

01:00:05.969 --> 01:00:08.371
HAVE HAD COVETED AND THERE AT

01:00:08.438 --> 01:00:11.708
LEAST FOR NOW NOT SUSCEPTIBLE

01:00:11.774 --> 01:00:15.411
TO BEING RE INFECTED. IT SEEMS

01:00:15.478 --> 01:00:17.413
THAT THEY'VE NOT HAD CODED THAT

01:00:17.480 --> 01:00:20.550
WITHOUT THE TESTING. IT'S HARD

01:00:20.616 --> 01:00:23.186
TO. IT WOULD BE HARD TO ASSURE

01:00:23.252 --> 01:00:25.355
A SAFE. TRANSFER BUT I SUPPOSE

01:00:25.421 --> 01:00:26.622
WITH THE QUARANTINE BUT WE'D

01:00:26.689 --> 01:00:28.324
HAVE TO BE ABLE TO HAVE

01:00:28.391 --> 01:00:31.027
QUARANTINE. IN AN AREA WHERE

01:00:31.094 --> 01:00:32.795
IT'S REALLY SEGREGATED OR ANY

01:00:32.862 --> 01:00:34.263
FORCE MY UNDERSTANDING IS PART

01:00:34.330 --> 01:00:35.465
OF THE PROBLEM IT STANDPOINT

01:00:35.531 --> 01:00:37.266
WAS. WE DIDN'T HAVE AS MUCH

01:00:37.333 --> 01:00:40.336
ACCESS TO AREAS IN STANDPOINT

01:00:40.403 --> 01:00:41.371
WHERE WE COULD ACHIEVE THAT.

01:00:41.437 --> 01:00:42.505
YOU'RE RIGHT SENATOR AND THAT'S

01:00:42.572 --> 01:00:44.073
PART OF THE PROCESS THAT WE

01:00:44.140 --> 01:00:46.275
WENT HROUGH WITH OUR- OUTSIDE

01:00:46.342 --> 01:00:47.310
STAKEHOLDERS TO ENSURE THAT

01:00:47.377 --> 01:00:49.212
EVERY SINGLE PRISON HAS CELL

01:00:49.278 --> 01:00:51.881
BASED. HOUSING FOR RECEPTION

01:00:51.948 --> 01:00:53.483
QUARANTINE AND THE FEW THAT

01:00:53.549 --> 01:00:55.184
THEIR PHYSICAL PLANT DOESN'T

01:00:55.251 --> 01:00:55.985
ALLOW THAT WE'VE MADE OTHER

01:00:56.052 --> 01:00:57.887
ARRANGEMENTS. BUT THAT

01:00:57.954 --> 01:01:00.256
QUARANTINE AND TESTING ON THE

01:01:00.323 --> 01:01:02.925
RECEIVING END IS CRITICAL. MY

01:01:02.992 --> 01:01:04.527
LAST QUESTION THIS IS AROUND

01:01:04.594 --> 01:01:08.064
JUVENILE SO HOPEFULLY-

01:01:08.131 --> 01:01:10.166
HOPEFULLY COMMUNITIES GIPSON

01:01:10.233 --> 01:01:11.667
ARE YOU DOCTOR BIG YOU'LL HAVE

01:01:11.734 --> 01:01:13.302
THE ANSWER TO THIS BUT I

01:01:13.369 --> 01:01:15.405
WONDERED IF THIS CDC ARE-

01:01:15.471 --> 01:01:17.673
TRACKER DOES NOT SHOW THE

01:01:17.740 --> 01:01:20.476
NUMBER OF CASES WITHIN OUR DOJ

01:01:20.543 --> 01:01:23.613
AND SO I WONDERED WHAT IS- WHAT

01:01:23.679 --> 01:01:24.981
ARE WE DOING IN TERMS OF

01:01:25.048 --> 01:01:26.749
TRACKING THE YOUTH THEY'RE BOTH

01:01:26.816 --> 01:01:30.453
ON TESTING AND CODE CASES. AND

01:01:30.520 --> 01:01:32.388
IF THE IF THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE

01:01:32.455 --> 01:01:34.724
IS BEING- IF HE'S IF THEY'RE

01:01:34.791 --> 01:01:38.628
RECEIVING THESE REPORTS. SINCE

01:01:38.694 --> 01:01:41.731
IT'S NOT ON A PUBLIC WEBSITE.

01:01:41.798 --> 01:01:43.332
SO I DON'T KNOW WHY IT'S NOT ON

01:01:43.399 --> 01:01:44.534
THE PUBLIC WEBSITES I DO

01:01:44.600 --> 01:01:47.270
APOLOGIZE FOR THAT BUT I SHOWED

01:01:47.336 --> 01:01:50.139
AS OF THIS MORNING WHEN I. J.

01:01:50.206 --> 01:01:52.742
J. CURRENTLY HAS IS SHOWING NO

01:01:52.809 --> 01:01:55.311
CURRENT GOAL THAT CASE AS- BUT

01:01:55.378 --> 01:01:56.446
I CAN'T SPEAK TO WHY IT'S NOT

01:01:56.512 --> 01:01:57.847
ON THE PUBLIC FACING AND I

01:01:57.914 --> 01:01:59.449
WOULD THINK THAT INFORMATION IS

01:01:59.515 --> 01:02:04.087
SHARED WITH THE- EXAMPLES. HAVE

01:02:04.153 --> 01:02:05.421
THERE BEEN ANY JUVENILE DEATHS

01:02:05.488 --> 01:02:08.091
IN APOLOGIES I HAD NOT TRIED TO

01:02:08.157 --> 01:02:10.426
LOOK AT THAT I DIDN'T KNOW HAVE

01:02:10.493 --> 01:02:12.228
THERE BEEN ANY YET. RELATED TO

01:02:12.295 --> 01:02:16.599
KOBE. THE DOCUMENTS I HAVE TO

01:02:16.666 --> 01:02:18.701
GO AHEAD AFTER THE- NO I WASN'T

01:02:18.768 --> 01:02:19.502
SPEAKING BUT CENTER MY

01:02:19.569 --> 01:02:21.037
UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE

01:02:21.104 --> 01:02:25.341

GETTING ADDRESSED AND RECOGNIZE

01:03:47.723 --> 01:03:50.092

ENVIRONMENT THAT WE FIND AND SO

01:04:15.952 --> 01:04:17.019

WITH A PRESENT AND THE WE IT

01:22:28.343 --> 01:22:31.146
OUT BY ALONE ONE HOUSE UNIT AT

01:22:31.212 --> 01:22:35.250
A TIME GO TO YOUR- SO MAYBE WE-

01:22:35.317 --> 01:22:38.053

USE. THE PROPOSAL- THE MEASURES

01:22:51.299 --> 01:22:52.901
THAT THAT DIRECT GIPSON

01:22:52.967 --> 01:22:53.968
DESCRIBING ARE EXACTLY PART OF

01:22:54.035 --> 01:22:55.970
I MEAN. PRISONS WITHIN. THE

01:22:56.037 --> 01:22:57.706
DIFFICULTY IS WHEN THE

01:22:57.772 --> 01:22:59.841
CROSSLINK BE THOSE YOU REMAIN.

01:22:59.908 --> 01:23:00.442
SO IF YOU LOOK FOR IN AT THE

01:23:00.508 --> 01:23:05.980
RECENT. A LARGE OPEN AT S. A.

01:23:06.047 --> 01:23:08.416
T. F. THE SUBS OF TO TREAT THIS.

01:23:08.483 --> 01:23:10.318
MY UNDER THAT THE WAS COULD. TO

01:23:10.385 --> 01:23:12.420
BY THE FACT. THE KIDS STAFF.

01:23:12.487 --> 01:23:14.589
AND THE LITTLE WERE WORKING A

01:23:14.656 --> 01:23:17.759
THE BUTTER WHEN YOU. FOR WERE

01:23:17.826 --> 01:23:18.360
MIXING WITH LARGE NUMBERS OF

01:23:18.426 --> 01:23:20.895
OTHER. AND THAT WHAT HAVE THERE

01:23:20.962 --> 01:23:24.199
FOR WAS THAT. THE NAY CHAU OUT

01:23:24.265 --> 01:23:31.306
BREAK THAT HAVE. THE BETTER

01:23:31.373 --> 01:23:33.575
MANUFACTURING VESSEL AND- WAS

01:23:33.641 --> 01:23:35.043
UNABLE TO SEE VERY RAPIDLY TO

01:23:35.110 --> 01:23:37.312
ALMOST HUNDRED. IF THE PRESENCE

01:23:37.379 --> 01:23:40.148
ARE ON IT'S A WAY THAT THE

01:23:40.215 --> 01:23:41.316
ISN'T STAFF ACROSS OVER THE

01:23:41.383 --> 01:23:43.218
DOESN'T SHIFT IN HOUSING UNIT

01:23:43.284 --> 01:23:44.986
THE AFTERNOON IN ANOTHER. AND

01:23:45.053 --> 01:23:45.587
IT DOESN'T HAVE RESIDENTS ARE

01:23:45.653 --> 01:23:47.122
WORK IN ONE A AND THEN SLEEPING

01:23:47.188 --> 01:23:49.057
IN ANOTHER A- AND- THIS RAP.

01:23:49.124 --> 01:23:49.624
TRANSMISSION FROM ONE HOUSE

01:23:49.691 --> 01:23:50.892
UNIT TO A- THAT'S WHAT I MEAN

01:23:50.959 --> 01:23:52.961
BY MORE EFFECTIVE. TO WEAR

01:23:53.027 --> 01:23:54.295
THOSE MANY PRISONS THAT THE

01:23:54.362 --> 01:23:56.598
DIRECTOR GIPSON DESCRIBED ARE

01:23:56.664 --> 01:23:57.699
FURTHER ISOLATED FROM EACH

01:23:57.766 --> 01:23:59.467
OTHER BY PREVENTING BOTH STAFF

01:23:59.534 --> 01:24:01.002
AND RESIDENTS FROM CROSSING

01:24:01.069 --> 01:24:02.737
OVER BETWEEN THEM. AND THAT

01:24:02.804 --> 01:24:04.339
THOSE STAFF WHO HAVE TO CROSS

01:24:04.406 --> 01:24:05.573
OVER BETWEEN THEM OF THOSE

01:24:05.640 --> 01:24:08.076
RESIDENTS WHO AFTER CROSSOVER

01:24:08.143 --> 01:24:10.478
THEY HAVE ENHANCED TESTING THEY

01:24:10.545 --> 01:24:10.945
HAVE ENHANCED PERSONAL

01:24:11.012 --> 01:24:12.680
PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT- SO THAT

01:24:12.747 --> 01:24:14.616
WHEN. AN INFECTION HAPPENS IT

01:24:14.682 --> 01:24:15.483
CAN BE DETECTED EVEN MORE

01:24:15.550 --> 01:24:16.751
QUICKLY BECAUSE OF THE

01:24:16.818 --> 01:24:22.323
POTENTIAL. TO INFECT MULTIPLE

01:24:22.390 --> 01:24:23.491
HOUSING UNITS AT THE SAME TIME.

01:24:23.558 --> 01:24:24.592
SO IS THERE SOMETHING TAKE A

01:24:24.659 --> 01:24:28.296
ABSENT THAT- SKIP THAT- AND HE

01:24:28.363 --> 01:24:29.798
CONSIDER OR THE YOU'RE WILLING

01:24:29.864 --> 01:24:31.232
CAN. I MEAN IF WE'RE IF WE'RE

01:24:31.299 --> 01:24:34.769
TRYING TO. KIND OF. MAKE THIS

01:24:34.836 --> 01:24:39.007
WORK. I WOULD USE TO THAT. YES

01:24:39.073 --> 01:24:41.609
WHAT DOCTOR TOLD THE SAYS SENSE

01:24:41.676 --> 01:24:43.011
AND SO FARAS- TRYING TO KEEP

01:24:43.077 --> 01:24:43.812
THOSE WORK WHO MAY BE KITCHEN

01:24:43.878 --> 01:24:45.747
WERE ASIDE TO ONE. IN AND SO

01:24:45.814 --> 01:24:47.982
LOOKED LOOK AT THAT AND HAVE

01:24:48.049 --> 01:24:49.818
THOSE CONVERSATIONS- BECAUSE WE

01:24:49.884 --> 01:24:52.053
ARE TRYING TO. YOU KNOW REALLY

01:24:52.120 --> 01:24:54.088
HAVE OUR STAFF STAY IN ONE AREA

01:24:54.155 --> 01:24:55.790
WORK ONE AREA UNDERSTANDING

01:24:55.857 --> 01:24:58.893
SOMETIME WE BUMP UP AGAINST

01:24:58.960 --> 01:25:00.795
HAVING TO. HIGHER TIME BECAUSE

01:25:00.862 --> 01:25:04.532
UP CALL SO. BUT THE- TO SOME

01:25:04.599 --> 01:25:06.801
THAT RECKON I THEM. AS RELATES

01:25:06.868 --> 01:25:07.969
TO TRY TO MITIGATE THE SPREAD

01:25:08.036 --> 01:25:10.905
WE COULD LOOK THAT CENTER.

01:25:10.972 --> 01:25:14.542
RIGHT AND MY LAST- GO TO THIS.

01:25:14.609 --> 01:25:19.180
SEEM TAKING A LOOK AT. MEDICAL

01:25:19.247 --> 01:25:21.349
HIGH RISK OF PRISONERS EARLY

01:25:21.416 --> 01:25:27.422
REAL. OR COMPARE WERE- SO THEY-

01:25:27.489 --> 01:25:28.323
YOU CAN REDUCE SIZE THE PRISON.

01:25:28.389 --> 01:25:33.695
IN DO SO. LOW RISK- IT MAY

01:25:33.761 --> 01:25:38.299
STATUS JUST DOT. WELLBEING

DO YOU FEEL THAT YOU'RE MOVING

01:25:51.412 --> 01:25:53.214
AT THE PACE THAT WILL

ULTIMATELY BE RESPONSIVE TO

01:25:55.250 --> 01:25:56.417
THOSE ISSUES WITH YOU KNOW GET

01:25:56.484 --> 01:25:57.785
TAKING PEOPLE GETTING PEOPLE

01:25:57.852 --> 01:25:59.854
OUT OF DONE THEIR TIME AND ARE

01:25:59.921 --> 01:26:01.990
AT LOW RISK OR WHO MIGHT BE-

01:26:02.056 --> 01:26:04.459
HAVE THE HIGH. RISKS FOR

01:26:04.526 --> 01:26:08.062
COALBED ARE OTHERWISE LOW RISK

01:26:08.129 --> 01:26:10.665
FOR RECIDIVISM. WHAT HAPPENING

01:26:10.732 --> 01:26:11.399
WITH THEIR PROGRAM BECAUSE THAT

01:26:11.466 --> 01:26:15.503
SEEMS TO HAVE SOME PROMISE- AND

01:26:15.570 --> 01:26:16.671
SOMETHING THAT IT'S- LIKE

01:26:16.738 --> 01:26:18.706

01:26:36.324 --> 01:26:44.532
ANTICIPATE HOW WE CAN. EXPEDITE

01:26:44.599 --> 01:26:45.633
RELEASE WHEN IT'S APPROPRIATE.

01:26:45.700 --> 01:26:46.901

01:27:19.634 --> 01:27:22.270
TO THAT PROCESS- BUT I CAN DE

01:27:22.337 --> 01:27:24.606
TAKE THIS BACK I AM SO I DON'T

01:27:24.672 --> 01:27:27.575
AN ANSWER FOR YOU I JUST WHO

01:27:27.642 --> 01:27:29.377
GETS TO DO THESE THINGS I MEAN

01:27:29.444 --> 01:27:33.581
IT IT'S KINDA FEELS YOU YOU ARE.

01:27:33.648 --> 01:27:35.249
THE SOLD OF WHETHER CAN

01:27:35.316 --> 01:27:36.250
RELEASED ON AN EARLY RELEASE

01:27:36.317 --> 01:27:37.285
PROGRAM FOR THE REASON THAT

01:27:37.352 --> 01:27:40.722
WE'VE DISCUSSED- ACT THAT'S

01:27:40.788 --> 01:27:42.657
REALLY TO YOU EXCLUSIVELY TO

01:27:42.724 --> 01:27:43.725
YOU YOU KNOW UP TO THE PRISONS

01:27:43.791 --> 01:27:47.228
EXCLUSIVELY. WHILE THE

01:27:47.295 --> 01:27:48.630
SECRETARY DOES HAVE A- DO

01:27:48.696 --> 01:27:51.799
RELEASE AS- AND I'M SORRY I

01:27:51.866 --> 01:27:52.433
DON'T HAVE THE GOVERNMENT CODE

01:27:52.500 --> 01:27:53.735
THAT ALLOWS FOR THAT. SO I

01:27:53.801 --> 01:27:55.470
CAN'T SAY WHAT ALL SHE'S

01:27:55.536 --> 01:27:56.638
ALLOWED TO DO BUT I DON'T WANT

01:27:56.704 --> 01:28:00.041
TO. SPEAK ON HER BEHALF AS TO.

01:28:00.108 --> 01:28:02.343
AT THAT ISSUE I DO KNOW AS A

01:28:02.410 --> 01:28:03.444
SET OF SIXTY TWO HUNDRED.

01:28:03.511 --> 01:28:05.947
EARLIER FALL LATE SUMMER REVIEW

01:28:06.014 --> 01:28:07.982
BY P. P. H. AND I DON'T KNOW

01:28:08.049 --> 01:28:09.117
THE NUMBER OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS

01:28:09.183 --> 01:28:11.052
WHO WERE APPROVED FOR RELEASE.

01:28:11.119 --> 01:28:12.654
BUT I KNOW- THE BOARD OF PAROLE

01:28:12.720 --> 01:28:13.955
HEARINGS THAT REVEALED THEY

01:28:14.022 --> 01:28:14.622
WERE SUBMITTED TO THE

01:28:14.689 --> 01:28:16.524
SECRETARY. AND THE FORMER

01:28:16.591 --> 01:28:19.127
SECRETARY- MASON DECISIONS AS

01:28:19.193 --> 01:28:20.795
TO WHETHER TO RELEASE OR NOT

01:28:20.862 --> 01:28:21.963
AND I DON'T HAVE THOSE NUMBERS

01:28:22.030 --> 01:28:23.898
SENATOR. SHOW IN A BOTTOM LINE

01:28:23.965 --> 01:28:25.466
THERE'S NO MANDATE TO DO IT

01:28:25.533 --> 01:28:27.468
THERE'S TRUST- THROUGH A

01:28:27.535 --> 01:28:28.736
PROCESS THAT EXISTS OF THE

01:28:28.803 --> 01:28:31.005
SECRETARY SO DECIDES IS THAT

01:28:31.072 --> 01:28:33.007
ACCURATE. I THINK I MAY BE

01:28:33.074 --> 01:28:35.643
OVERSIMPLIFYING IT SENATORS SO.

01:28:35.710 --> 01:28:38.079
I WANT TO SAY I DO KNOW THE

01:28:38.146 --> 01:28:40.314
SECRETARY HAS. THE AUTHORITY

01:28:40.381 --> 01:28:41.616
UNDER GOVERNMENT CO. BUT I

01:28:41.683 --> 01:28:42.517
THINK IT'S MORE COMPLEX THAN

01:28:42.583 --> 01:28:44.752
THAT. THANK YOU AND I JUST LIKE

01:28:44.819 --> 01:28:46.087
TO SUGGEST TO MY COLLEAGUES

SINCE. IN ABOUT TEN DAYS I WILL

01:28:48.423 --> 01:28:51.592
NO LONGER BE A SENATOR- THROUGH

01:28:51.659 --> 01:28:53.361
THE GREAT TERM LIMITS PROGRAM

01:28:53.428 --> 01:28:55.029
I'M SUGGEST THIS MIGHT BE

01:28:55.096 --> 01:28:56.764
SOMETHING WHERE WE SHOULD LOOK

01:28:56.831 --> 01:29:03.304
MORE. CAREFULLY BECAUSE. IT

01:29:03.371 --> 01:29:05.106
SOUNDS LIKE. THE DECISION MAKER

01:29:05.173 --> 01:29:07.842
IS SOME UP IN THE EITHER- AND

01:29:07.909 --> 01:29:10.745
THEN FOR. UNDER THE SIR. THIS

01:29:10.812 --> 01:29:12.814
IS AN OP. FOR LEGISLATURE. ODDS

01:29:12.880 --> 01:29:15.550
SAID PAUL IS TO WIN. ARE THESE

01:29:15.616 --> 01:29:19.287
PRISON ARE SHOULD- AT RISK. TO

01:29:19.353 --> 01:29:22.056
THE PRETTY. CRISIS THERE DOES

01:29:22.123 --> 01:29:23.958
AS THIS ONE OR WHEN HAPPENING

01:29:24.025 --> 01:29:24.826
IN THE FUTURE JUST GENERALLY TO

01:29:24.892 --> 01:29:26.527
TRY. REDUCE THE SIZE OF OUR

01:29:26.594 --> 01:29:30.598
PRISON IF THEY'RE ON NEXT-

01:29:30.665 --> 01:29:33.534
CROWDED- AFTER. WHO JUST- TO BE

01:29:33.601 --> 01:29:35.670
REALLY FOR. MEDICAL SO LOW RISK

01:29:35.737 --> 01:29:38.005
REASONS BUT IT SEEMS THERE'S A

01:29:38.072 --> 01:29:39.907
WAY TOO MUCH. A HERE. WITHIN

01:29:39.974 --> 01:29:41.743
THE PRISONS- TO MAKE THOSE.

01:29:41.809 --> 01:29:43.978
UNILATERALLY FRANKLY WITHOUT A

01:29:44.045 --> 01:29:45.947
WHOLE LOT OF ACCOUNTABILITY. SO

A SEARCH- THE SIX DIRECT GIVE

EIGHTY TWO HUNDRED WHO ARE

HIRED LESTER ONE PER WERE

01:30:35.029 --> 01:30:38.466
ACTUALLY RELEASED- SO LESS THAN

01:30:38.533 --> 01:30:40.935
EIGHTY PEOPLE- WERE EVEN THOUGH

01:30:41.002 --> 01:30:42.370
THEY THE ISSUE WAS NOT WHETHER

01:30:42.436 --> 01:30:44.272
OR NOT THEY WERE HIGHER OF DID

01:30:44.338 --> 01:30:45.106
THE ISSUE WAS THE TYPE OF SAN

01:30:45.173 --> 01:30:46.507
THEY HAVE WHETHER THEY WERE

01:30:46.574 --> 01:30:48.109
WHERE LIFE ARE NOT. OF THE VERY

01:30:48.176 --> 01:30:49.243

CD OURS ELDERLY POPULAR ARE

01:30:54.415 --> 01:30:56.450
PEOPLE WITH A SENTENCE HE WOULD

DETERMINE IS INSISTENT BE

01:30:58.619 --> 01:31:02.089
YOUNGER- SO THE MOST VULNERABLE

HIGH RISK MEDICAL CONSIDERATION

01:31:08.996 --> 01:31:10.531
BECAUSE OF IT- AND SO THAT'S

01:31:10.598 --> 01:31:12.099
SOMETHING THAT'S GREAT FOR THE

01:31:12.166 --> 01:31:14.135
LEGISLATURE TO LOOK AT HOW DO

01:31:14.202 --> 01:31:16.337
WE CREATE MORE AVENUES FOR

01:31:16.404 --> 01:31:18.539
LIFERS TO GET OUT IN A LARGE

01:31:18.606 --> 01:31:23.678

COLLEAGUE A LOT- MY QUESTION IS

01:31:45.266 --> 01:31:48.169
TO DOCTOR PROPOSED. I'M CURIOUS

01:31:48.236 --> 01:31:51.606
ABOUT METRICS- HOW DO WE

01:31:51.672 --> 01:31:54.508
COMPARE TO THE OTHER FORTY NINE

01:31:54.575 --> 01:31:56.844
PRISON SYSTEMS IN THIS COUNTRY.

01:31:56.911 --> 01:31:57.678
WE SHOULD KNOW HOW MANY

01:31:57.745 --> 01:31:59.046
PRISONERS WE HAVE HOW MANY

01:31:59.113 --> 01:32:01.282
CASES AND HOW MANY DEATHS AND

01:32:01.349 --> 01:32:03.251
I'M JUST WONDERING- HOW THAT

01:32:03.317 --> 01:32:05.753
DATA COMPARES TO THE OTHER

01:32:05.820 --> 01:32:07.188
FORTY NINE STATES EVERY

01:32:07.255 --> 01:32:08.923
AVERAGE- WE- WORSE ARE WE

01:32:08.990 --> 01:32:13.861
BETTER. THANK YOU REAL QUICK

01:32:13.928 --> 01:32:15.329
AND I WISH I WAS BETTER

01:32:15.396 --> 01:32:17.665
PREPARED TO ANSWER IT- LET ME

01:32:17.732 --> 01:32:19.500
SAY THAT THE LAST TO STATISTICS

01:32:19.567 --> 01:32:21.736
THAT I SAW SUGGESTED THAT.

01:32:21.802 --> 01:32:23.404
SEVEN OF THE TOP TEN PRISON AND

01:32:23.471 --> 01:32:24.538
JAIL OUTBREAKS IN THE COUNTRY

01:32:24.605 --> 01:32:27.475
WERE IN CALIFORNIA. SO THAT

01:32:27.541 --> 01:32:29.677
ISN'T AN ENCOURAGING SIGN-

01:32:29.744 --> 01:32:32.313
HOWEVER I DID READ. SEE SOME

01:32:32.380 --> 01:32:33.514
FROM TEXAS SUGGESTS THAT

01:32:33.581 --> 01:32:36.284
THEY'RE DOING WORSE- IN TERMS

01:32:36.350 --> 01:32:37.952
OF MORTALITY. AND ONE SHOCKING

01:32:38.019 --> 01:32:39.887
STATISTIC WHICH IS VERY MUCH

01:32:39.954 --> 01:32:41.222
ALONG THE LINES OF WHAT SENATOR

01:32:41.289 --> 01:32:42.356
JACKSON MISTER KING WE'RE JUST

01:32:42.423 --> 01:32:44.091
SPEAKING ABOUT. AND THAT IS

01:32:44.158 --> 01:32:46.460
THAT OF THE DEATHS IN TEXAS 58%

01:32:46.527 --> 01:32:48.696
OF THOSE WERE ELIGIBLE FOR

01:32:48.763 --> 01:32:49.263
PAROLE AT THE TIME OF THEIR

01:32:49.330 --> 01:32:51.565
DEATH. AND AND THAT'S SOMETHING

01:32:51.632 --> 01:32:53.868
THAT I THINK- IS A VERY

01:32:53.935 --> 01:32:54.902
SOBERING STATISTIC AND

01:32:54.969 --> 01:32:55.636
SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD THINK

01:32:55.703 --> 01:32:58.539
ABOUT- THOSE PEOPLE ARE AND DO

01:32:58.606 --> 01:33:00.508
NOT HAVE DEATH SENTENCES. AND

01:33:00.574 --> 01:33:01.809
YET THEY'RE DYING AS A RESULT

01:33:01.876 --> 01:33:03.744
OF THE CONDITIONS THAT THEY'RE

01:33:03.811 --> 01:33:06.080
THEY'RE HOUSED IN. MY NEXT

01:33:06.147 --> 01:33:09.717
QUESTION IS TO- DR BECK- OF

01:33:09.784 --> 01:33:12.119
BASED ON WHAT WE'RE LEARNING SO

01:33:12.186 --> 01:33:16.190
FAR THIS YEAR WHAT WHAT HAVE.

01:33:16.257 --> 01:33:18.025
WE'VE DEVELOPED AS BEST

01:33:18.092 --> 01:33:19.827
MANAGEMENT PRACTICES WHAT WE

01:33:19.894 --> 01:33:20.561
DETERMINED THAT WE SHOULD BE

01:33:20.628 --> 01:33:22.830
DOING. AND NOW THAT WE HAVE

01:33:22.897 --> 01:33:24.932
MORE DATA. TO AVAIL OURSELVES

01:33:24.999 --> 01:33:29.770
FROM. SOONER TO SEE I THINK THE

01:33:29.837 --> 01:33:31.339
MOST STRIKING THING WE'VE

01:33:31.405 --> 01:33:33.741
LEARNED IS THAT IF YOU ARE IN

01:33:33.808 --> 01:33:37.178
ANY OPEN DORM SETTING. OR A HOW

01:33:37.244 --> 01:33:39.480
UNIT THAT'S FUNCTION AN OPEN

01:33:39.547 --> 01:33:42.216
DORM LIFE SAME PARTNER FALL

01:33:42.283 --> 01:33:43.084
SOMEWHERE YOU MAY HAVE YOUR

01:33:43.150 --> 01:33:45.119
INTERNET SO. BUT THE FRONT DOOR

01:33:45.186 --> 01:33:47.121
IS ACTUALLY EITHER BY OR FOR

01:33:47.188 --> 01:33:49.523
FREE. THAT IT'S INCREDIBLE

01:33:49.590 --> 01:33:51.592
CHALLENGING TO KEEP SOMEBODY

01:33:51.659 --> 01:33:52.059
SAFE AND THAT TYPE OF

01:33:52.126 --> 01:33:54.462
ENVIRONMENT. AND ESPECIALLY FOR

01:33:54.528 --> 01:33:56.130
OUR HIGHER RISK PEOPLE THE

01:33:56.197 --> 01:33:57.598
PEOPLE THAT HAVE ARE HIGHER

01:33:57.665 --> 01:34:00.634
CRUDE RESTORES- THERE'S A

01:34:00.701 --> 01:34:02.103
THERE'S AND URGING TO GET THEM

01:34:02.169 --> 01:34:04.805
MOVED INTO. THAT ARE LESS

01:34:04.872 --> 01:34:10.111
LIKELY TO EXPOSE THEM TO KOBE.

01:34:10.177 --> 01:34:12.413
AND THEN OF. BY LAST QUESTION

01:34:12.480 --> 01:34:19.420
IS TO. MR AS WERE- PRISONERS BE

01:34:19.487 --> 01:34:22.189
RELEASED BACK INTO THE PUBLIC

01:34:22.256 --> 01:34:24.792
SECTOR WORK WHAT DO WE DO TO

01:34:24.859 --> 01:34:27.762
ASSURE OUR CONSTITUENTS STATE

01:34:27.828 --> 01:34:28.362
THEY WANT TO FEEL SAFE SO WHAT

01:34:28.429 --> 01:34:31.098
DO WE- WHAT ARE WE ARE WE GOING

01:34:31.165 --> 01:34:33.401
TO GUARANTEE THAT FOR.

01:34:33.467 --> 01:34:36.003
CONSTITUENTS THANK YOU A I

01:34:36.070 --> 01:34:37.304
REALLY APPRECIATE THAT

01:34:37.371 --> 01:34:42.143
QUESTION- THE MAJORITY OF

01:34:42.209 --> 01:34:43.878
PEOPLE WHO ARE INCARCERATED

01:34:43.944 --> 01:34:44.945
THROUGHOUT OUR STATE PRISON

01:34:45.012 --> 01:34:46.013
SYSTEM WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

01:34:46.080 --> 01:34:47.782
PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN IN TEN

01:34:47.848 --> 01:34:49.417
FIFTEEN YEARS ON TWENTY YEARS

01:34:49.483 --> 01:34:50.818
THERE ARE NO MORE THE SAME

01:34:50.885 --> 01:34:53.020
PEOPLE THEY ARE TODAY THEN YOU

01:34:53.087 --> 01:34:54.288

01:34:59.026 --> 01:35:01.162
DAY WITH SOLID RELEASE PLANS

FROM CALIFORNIA PRISONS AND

JAILS THE ICE AFFECT HEALTH.

02:03:48.354 --> 02:03:50.022
THE STUDIES DOCUMENT THE HEALTH

02:03:50.089 --> 02:03:52.458
HARMS OF CARCERAL SYSTEMS TO

02:03:52.525 --> 02:03:53.392
THOSE WHO ARE INCARCERATED OR

DETAINED THEIR FAMILIES AND

EVEN SURROUNDING COMMUNITIES.

02:03:58.063 --> 02:03:59.365
FOR EXAMPLE PEOPLE WHO HAVE

02:03:59.431 --> 02:04:01.433
BEEN INCARCERATED HAVE HIGHER

EXPECTANCY. AND PREGNANT PEOPLE

02:04:08.374 --> 02:04:10.943
WHO SIMPLY LIVING TOWNIES WITH

02:04:11.010 --> 02:04:12.077
HIGH RATES OF JAIL

02:04:12.144 --> 02:04:15.748
INCARCERATION ARE MORE LIKELY

02:04:15.815 --> 02:04:17.550
TO EXPERIENCE PRETERM BIRTHS.

02:04:17.616 --> 02:04:19.618
WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT MANY

02:04:19.685 --> 02:04:21.687
IMMIGRANTS AND REFUGEES ARRIVE

02:04:21.754 --> 02:04:23.656
TO THE U. S. WITH TRAUMA WHICH

02:04:23.722 --> 02:04:25.825
UNFORTUNATELY CAN PAVE THE WAY

02:04:25.891 --> 02:04:28.527
FOR CRIMINALIZATION. WE PUT

02:04:28.594 --> 02:04:31.163
EXACTLY WHEN PEOPLE MOST NEED

02:04:31.230 --> 02:04:33.899
RESOURCES TO HEAL THERE INSTEAD

02:04:33.966 --> 02:04:37.403
POLICE AND FINAL TO JAILS.

02:04:37.469 --> 02:04:39.905
FURTHERMORE DEPORTATION OR THE

02:04:39.972 --> 02:04:41.273
THREAT OF DEPORTATION

02:04:41.340 --> 02:04:43.275
EXACERBATES HEALTH CONDITIONS

02:04:43.342 --> 02:04:45.010
LIKE HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE.

02:04:45.077 --> 02:04:46.779
RESEARCH ALSO SHOWS THAT

02:04:46.846 --> 02:04:49.014
CHILDREN WHO ARE WORRIED ABOUT

02:04:49.081 --> 02:04:51.450
THEIR PARENTS DEPORTATION OFTEN

02:04:51.517 --> 02:04:52.718
EXPERIENCE WORSENED MENTAL

02:04:52.785 --> 02:04:55.855
HEALTH. A CENTRALLY THE PUBLIC

02:04:55.921 --> 02:04:58.390
HEALTH DATA ARE CLEAR JAILS

02:04:58.457 --> 02:05:00.693
PRISONS IN ICE DETENTION ARE

02:05:00.759 --> 02:05:02.928
ANTITHETICAL TO PUBLIC HEALTH.

02:05:02.995 --> 02:05:05.030
IT IS NOT A MATTER OF IF THERE

02:05:05.097 --> 02:05:06.365
WILL BE COPING NINETEEN

02:05:06.432 --> 02:05:09.001
OUTBREAKS INSIDE EVERY SINGLE

02:05:09.068 --> 02:05:12.705
CARCERAL FACILITY BUT WHEN. AND

02:05:12.771 --> 02:05:14.139
BECAUSE THE POOREST NATURE OF

02:05:14.206 --> 02:05:16.775
THESE FACILITIES THESE ALEX CAN

02:05:16.842 --> 02:05:19.378
ENDANGER AND OVERWHELM REGIONAL

02:05:19.445 --> 02:05:22.147
HEALTH SYSTEMS. IS TRANSFERS

02:05:22.214 --> 02:05:24.383
ARE THESE KEY PIPELINE TICE

02:05:24.450 --> 02:05:27.119
ATTENTION ABOUT 70% OF PEOPLE

02:05:27.186 --> 02:05:29.288
IN ICE CUSTODY ARE THERE

02:05:29.355 --> 02:05:32.191
BECAUSE OF A DIRECT TRANSFER.

02:05:32.258 --> 02:05:34.159
CALIFORNIA IS NOT A PASSIVE

02:05:34.226 --> 02:05:36.395
PARTICIPANT IN THIS PROCESS

02:05:36.462 --> 02:05:38.898
CALIFORNIA VOLUNTARILY AND

02:05:38.964 --> 02:05:41.834
ACTIVELY COLLABORATES WITH ICE

02:05:41.901 --> 02:05:44.904
IN THESE TRANSFERS. I NEED TO

02:05:44.970 --> 02:05:47.973
STATE ONE THING VERY PLAINLY.

02:05:48.040 --> 02:05:50.943
MUCH LIKE THERE'S NO TRULY

02:05:51.010 --> 02:05:51.510
HEALTHY AMOUNT OF LEAD TO

02:05:51.577 --> 02:05:54.446
CONSUME. AND THERE'S NO TRULY

02:05:54.513 --> 02:05:56.682
SAFE AMOUNT OF ASBESTOS TO

02:05:56.749 --> 02:06:00.853
BREEZE. THERE IS NO TRULY SAFE

02:06:00.920 --> 02:06:03.656
NOR HEALTHY WAY TO INCARCERATE

02:06:03.722 --> 02:06:06.025
PEOPLE WITHIN OR TRANSFER

02:06:06.091 --> 02:06:09.161
PEOPLE BETWEEN JAILS PRISONS IN

02:06:09.228 --> 02:06:11.096
ICE DETENTION CENTERS

02:06:11.163 --> 02:06:13.732
ESPECIALLY DURING A PANDEMIC

02:06:13.799 --> 02:06:16.101
MANY OR OTHERWISE. CALIFORNIA

02:06:16.168 --> 02:06:17.803
IS LITERALLY GAMBLING WITH

02:06:17.870 --> 02:06:21.707
PEOPLE'S LIVES. THE GOOD NEWS

02:06:21.774 --> 02:06:23.676
IS THAT THE RESEARCH ALSO

02:06:23.742 --> 02:06:26.111
POINTS US TOWARD SOLUTIONS WITH

02:06:26.178 --> 02:06:28.447
CHILDREN FOR EXAMPLE THERE IS

02:06:28.514 --> 02:06:30.816
EVIDENCE THAT THEY CAN RECOVER

02:06:30.883 --> 02:06:32.151
FROM TRAUMA IF THEY HAVE

02:06:32.217 --> 02:06:34.119
ADEQUATE SUPPORT INCLUDING

02:06:34.186 --> 02:06:37.656
CRUCIALLY STABLE RELATIONSHIPS

02:06:37.723 --> 02:06:39.258
WITH CAREGIVERS. LEASING

02:06:39.325 --> 02:06:41.827
COMMUNITIES LIKE CHAMPLIN BUNS

02:06:41.894 --> 02:06:43.929

BOTHSENATOR WIENER AND-

02:28:11.682 --> 02:28:14.318
SENATOR PAN- AND HOW WE CAN

02:28:14.385 --> 02:28:15.786
SORT OF WASH YOUR HANDS OF THIS

02:28:15.853 --> 02:28:17.622
THIS ISSUE- THE FIRST QUESTION

02:28:17.688 --> 02:28:19.190
I WILL- DIRECTED COURSES DID

02:28:19.257 --> 02:28:22.059
SHE DICKS AND- I'M WONDERING

02:28:22.126 --> 02:28:24.595
BECAUSE- UNFORTUNATELY CDPH DID

02:28:24.662 --> 02:28:25.930
NOT ATTEND AND WE WERE REALLY

02:28:25.997 --> 02:28:27.498
LOOKING FOR IT I'M- TENDING I

02:28:27.565 --> 02:28:28.165
THINK THAT'S AN ADDITIONAL

02:28:28.232 --> 02:28:31.602
LAYER. THAT IN MY OPINION THERE

02:28:31.669 --> 02:28:33.170
NEEDS TO BE OVERSIGHT AS WELL

02:28:33.237 --> 02:28:35.640
IN TERMS OF THE CONDITIONS NOT

02:28:35.706 --> 02:28:36.907
JUST IN OUR CURRENT PRESENTS

02:28:36.974 --> 02:28:38.943
BUT ALSO DETENTION CENTERS IF

02:28:39.010 --> 02:28:40.144
WE ARE TRANSFERRING FOLKS

02:28:40.211 --> 02:28:45.016
WHETHER WE BELIEVE. IT OR NOT-

02:28:45.082 --> 02:28:46.317
THERE SHOULD BE AN AT AND OVER

02:28:46.384 --> 02:28:49.687
OF. OUR LOCAL AGENCIES ARE KIND

02:28:49.754 --> 02:28:50.955
OF MANAGING AND LOOKING AT THE

02:28:51.022 --> 02:28:51.822
DETENTION CENTERS WERE

02:28:51.889 --> 02:28:53.591
TRANSFERRING PEOPLE TO. I'M

02:28:53.658 --> 02:28:55.059
HAPPY TO BE IN L. A. COUNTY

02:28:55.126 --> 02:28:56.694
WHERE THERE IS ACTUALLY A PLAN

02:28:56.761 --> 02:28:58.529
THAT WAS INSTITUTED IN APRIL

02:28:58.596 --> 02:29:00.097
BUT NOT EVERY COUNTY IS DOING

02:29:00.164 --> 02:29:01.499
THAT. SO I'M WONDERING I GUESS

02:29:01.565 --> 02:29:03.100
MY QUESTION CHU CHU SIX DIXON

02:29:03.167 --> 02:29:05.202
IS. ARE THERE ANY DISCUSSIONS

02:29:05.269 --> 02:29:07.705
WITH CD P. H. AS YOU'RE

02:29:07.772 --> 02:29:08.806
ENGAGING IN THESE TRANSFERS

02:29:08.873 --> 02:29:10.341
WHICH WE BELIEVE ARE VOLUNTARY

02:29:10.408 --> 02:29:11.442
YOU SEEM TO BELIEVE AND

02:29:11.509 --> 02:29:13.511
INTERPRET DIFFERENTLY. AND HOW

02:29:13.577 --> 02:29:16.814
TO. AS YOU'RE SENDING THESE

02:29:16.881 --> 02:29:18.549
CALIFORNIANS OVER. THAT THEY

02:29:18.616 --> 02:29:19.650
ARE UNSAFE I MEAN THAT IS THERE

02:29:19.717 --> 02:29:21.118
ANY WORK BEING DONE OR

02:29:21.185 --> 02:29:22.987
DISCUSSION WITH CD PH ON THE

02:29:23.054 --> 02:29:25.623
ARM. MAYBE DETENTION CENTERS.

02:29:25.690 --> 02:29:27.458
PROVIDING PLANS SO WHAT AT

02:29:27.525 --> 02:29:28.759
LEAST WE KNOW IT STATE.

02:29:28.826 --> 02:29:30.394
COMPLETELY DISAGREE WITH THE

02:29:30.461 --> 02:29:31.729
TRANSFER PROCESS BUT AT LEAST

02:29:31.796 --> 02:29:32.997
ENSURING THAT THESE DETENTION

02:29:33.064 --> 02:29:35.032
CENTERS HAVE SOME SORT OF.

02:29:35.099 --> 02:29:37.034
PARTICLES IF THERE IS I'M NOT

02:29:37.101 --> 02:29:38.769
AWARE OF ANY BUT THAT WOULD BE

02:29:38.836 --> 02:29:40.738
A LITTLE OUT OF MY SCOPE OF

02:29:40.805 --> 02:29:41.572
WHAT MY KNOWLEDGE AND

02:29:41.639 --> 02:29:42.940
RESPONSIBILITY IS SO I'M NOT

02:29:43.007 --> 02:29:45.776
AWARE. BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN

02:29:45.843 --> 02:29:47.611
THERE ISN'T ANYTHING I JUST I

02:29:47.678 --> 02:29:49.914
AM NOT AWARE OF ANYTHING. OKAY

02:29:49.980 --> 02:29:51.482
SO I THINK THAT JUST LEADS US

02:29:51.549 --> 02:29:52.650
TO BELIEVE THAT AGAIN WHEN WE

02:29:52.717 --> 02:29:54.051
ARE TALKING ABOUT THE ISSUE OF

02:29:54.118 --> 02:29:56.153
TRANSFERS IT SEEMS AS THOUGH

02:29:56.220 --> 02:29:57.421
WE'RE WASHING OUR HANDS OF DATA

02:29:57.488 --> 02:29:59.990
WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHO- IS

02:30:00.057 --> 02:30:02.093
BEING TRANSFERRED WE DON'T

02:30:02.159 --> 02:30:05.830
KNOW. WHO HAS- NINETEEN- WHICH

02:30:05.896 --> 02:30:07.365
DETENTION CENTERS ARE WORSE OFF

02:30:07.431 --> 02:30:08.599
THAN OTHERS IT SEEMS LIKE

02:30:08.666 --> 02:30:09.500
THEY'RE ALL HORRENDOUS

02:30:09.567 --> 02:30:12.203
UNFORTUNATELY WE HAVE NO PLANS

02:30:12.269 --> 02:30:13.204
FOR WHEN YOU'RE TRANSFERRING

02:30:13.270 --> 02:30:13.871
FOLKS THE LOCAL HEALTH

02:30:13.938 --> 02:30:15.773
DEPARTMENTS HAVE NO IDEAS WE

02:30:15.840 --> 02:30:16.474
KNOW THESE CALIFORNIANS ARE

02:30:16.540 --> 02:30:18.042
JUST BEING TRANSFERRED. IN A

02:30:18.109 --> 02:30:22.179
VERY DIRE SITUATION- MY ANOTHER

02:30:22.246 --> 02:30:25.182
QUESTION I HAVE IS. RELATED TO

02:30:25.249 --> 02:30:27.251
AND I DON'T BELIEVE YOU IT.

02:30:27.318 --> 02:30:30.221

CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE MEDICALLY

02:30:32.656 --> 02:30:35.459
FRAGILE IF THERE'S ADDITIONAL

02:30:35.526 --> 02:30:38.195
CONVERSATION ABOUT THAT. IN THE

02:30:38.262 --> 02:30:39.830
DISCUSSION OF TRANSFERRING IF

02:30:39.897 --> 02:30:41.766
YOU ARE COOPERATING TO YOUR

02:30:41.832 --> 02:30:44.034
INTERPRETATION WITH ICE. IS

02:30:44.101 --> 02:30:45.770
THERE ANY COMPASSION OR

02:30:45.836 --> 02:30:47.671
CONSIDERATION FOR INMATESWHO

02:30:47.738 --> 02:30:49.039
MIGHT BE THAT MEDICALLY BACK

02:30:49.106 --> 02:30:51.108
FRAGILE YOU'RE PUTTING THEM IN

02:30:51.175 --> 02:30:53.611
AN EVEN WORSE ENVIRONMENT. I

02:30:53.677 --> 02:30:56.080
CAN TELL YOU THAT- ICE AND

02:30:56.147 --> 02:30:57.982
OTHER LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES

02:30:58.048 --> 02:31:01.585
AS WELL WILL SOMETIMES ASK FOR

02:31:01.652 --> 02:31:04.321
MAYBE CO GOOD INFORMATION OR

ENFORCEMENT AGENCY ME CHOOSE

TO ADD ON TO THIS WE REALLY

AGAIN CLEARLY WE'RE- ON THE

02:31:43.027 --> 02:31:44.161
SAME TEACHER IN TERMS OF THE

02:31:44.228 --> 02:31:45.963
TRANSFERS AND THEY WERE EXACTLY

WE- DON'T WANT TO HEAD- SO IF

READING IS THE SAME AS AS THAT

02:32:02.446 --> 02:32:03.714
OF SENATOR WIENER IS A SAD FACT

02:32:03.781 --> 02:32:04.715
THAT PEOPLE COULD REALLY

02:32:04.782 --> 02:32:06.617
ADDRESSES. ONGOING REMOVAL

02:32:06.684 --> 02:32:07.952
PROCEEDINGS THAT SOMETIMES CAN

02:32:08.018 --> 02:32:09.119
HAPPEN WHILE PEOPLE ARE STILL

02:32:09.186 --> 02:32:10.855
INSTITUTIONALIZED IN CDCR

02:32:10.921 --> 02:32:14.024
CUSTODY IT MENTIONS. OF THE L.

02:32:14.091 --> 02:32:15.359
SOULS IT DOES NOT MEAN TO DO

02:32:15.426 --> 02:32:16.227
ANYTHING ABOUT MANDATORY

02:32:16.293 --> 02:32:17.862
COMPLIANCE WITH HOLDS

02:32:17.928 --> 02:32:19.497
NOTIFICATIONS OR FACILITATION

02:32:19.563 --> 02:32:21.265
OF TRANSFERS. IF THE READING

02:32:21.332 --> 02:32:22.933
WERE AS EXPENSIVE AS MYSTICS

02:32:23.000 --> 02:32:25.803
AND HAS- SHARE WITH US TODAY.

02:32:25.870 --> 02:32:26.737
THAT WOULD CERTAINLY BE IN

02:32:26.804 --> 02:32:28.105
CONFLICT WITH UPDATED GUIDANCE

02:32:28.172 --> 02:32:31.408
AND CDCR I BELIEVE IN TWO

02:32:31.475 --> 02:32:32.543
THOUSAND EIGHTEEN I'M THAT

02:32:32.610 --> 02:32:34.778
PROHIBITS HOLDS- YOU KNOW A

START READING WERE RIGHT AND IT

02:32:36.013 --> 02:32:36.914
WOULD IT WOULD CERTAINLY

02:32:36.981 --> 02:32:38.482
CONFLICT TO SEE TO SEE OUR OWN

02:32:38.549 --> 02:32:39.984
GUIDANCE. AND A SENATOR WIENER

02:32:40.050 --> 02:32:42.453
POINTED OUT I WOULD CDCR IS-

02:32:42.520 --> 02:32:44.321
ALONE. HAD TESTIMONY ONE OF

02:32:44.388 --> 02:32:46.624
THESE HEARINGS. THE SECOND AB.

02:32:46.690 --> 02:32:48.759
WINDOW MAKE IS THAT YOU KNOW

02:32:48.826 --> 02:32:49.960
I'M REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE

02:32:50.027 --> 02:32:51.896
SORT OF OBSCURITY AND THAT THEY

02:32:51.962 --> 02:32:52.997
INDEED SEEMINGLY INTENTIONAL

02:32:53.063 --> 02:32:54.965
CONFLATION BETWEEN POLICIES AND

02:32:55.032 --> 02:32:56.967
PROCEDURES. AND LAWS THOSE ARE

02:32:57.034 --> 02:32:58.135
TWO DIFFERENT THINGS POLICIES

02:32:58.202 --> 02:32:59.336

INTERESTING DISCUSSION AND IT-

02:34:30.628 --> 02:34:34.732
I TO SURE- SOME FRUSTRATION. ON

02:34:34.798 --> 02:34:37.034

02:34:37.101 --> 02:34:38.369

02:35:42.533 --> 02:35:44.468
EVERYTHING WE CAN TO LIMIT

ICE'S- ACTIVITIES WITHIN OUR

02:35:47.171 --> 02:35:48.806
COURT HOUSES FOR EXAMPLE EVEN

02:35:48.872 --> 02:35:50.841
THE CHIEF JUSTICE. MADE A VERY

02:35:50.908 --> 02:35:52.776
STRONG STATEMENT IN OPPOSITION

02:35:52.843 --> 02:35:54.344

OUR ABILITY. TO DISPENSE

ARE AFRAID THEY WON'T COME TO

02:36:00.217 --> 02:36:02.586
COURT- FOR FEAR THAT ICE IS

02:36:02.653 --> 02:36:03.854
THERE WAITING TO BE PLUCKED

02:36:03.921 --> 02:36:07.391
THEM OFF- WE HAVE REQUIREMENTS

NOW THAT. PEOPLE- WHEN THEY ARE

02:36:09.560 --> 02:36:11.228
IN A COURTROOM AND THE QUESTION

02:36:11.295 --> 02:36:13.363
ABOUT THEIR CITIZENSHIP FOR

02:36:13.430 --> 02:36:14.998
THEIR LAWFUL A PART OF

02:36:15.065 --> 02:36:17.034

02:36:17.101 --> 02:36:19.136
QUESTION THAT THEY WILL THEN BE

02:36:19.203 --> 02:36:20.671
ARE PERMITTED TO HAVE AN IN

02:36:20.738 --> 02:36:22.339
CAMERA PROCEEDING SO THAT THE

02:36:22.406 --> 02:36:23.807
PUBLIC ITSELF DOESN'T

02:36:23.874 --> 02:36:26.710
NECESSARILY GET TO HERE- JUST

02:36:26.777 --> 02:36:28.746
WHAT THEIR STATUS IS. I MEAN

02:36:28.812 --> 02:36:30.848
THE FACT THAT CDCR SAYS THAT

02:36:30.914 --> 02:36:32.850
THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO COOPERATE I

02:36:32.916 --> 02:36:34.451
THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT NEEDS

02:36:34.518 --> 02:36:36.120
TO BE EXAMINED AND I AND I

02:36:36.186 --> 02:36:37.788
APPRECIATE CENTER WINNER YOU

02:36:37.855 --> 02:36:40.057
ARE CALLING ATTENTION TO THAT

02:36:40.124 --> 02:36:42.893
AND CERTAINLY- GIVEN GIVEN WHAT

02:36:42.960 --> 02:36:43.660
WE'VE LEARNED ABOUT THE

02:36:43.727 --> 02:36:46.396
HORRIFIC INHUMANE TREATMENT. OF

02:36:46.463 --> 02:36:48.165

CAN DESCRIBE IT- IN THE SIZE

02:36:52.269 --> 02:36:54.204
FACILITIES I THINK THAT IS

02:36:54.271 --> 02:36:56.440
CONTRARY TO THE SPIRIT AND THE

02:36:56.507 --> 02:36:58.575
INTENT TO AND PROBABLY IF I'M

02:36:58.642 --> 02:37:00.677
NOT MISTAKEN THE ACTUAL LETTER

02:37:00.744 --> 02:37:02.446
OF THE LAW HERE IN CALIFORNIA

02:37:02.513 --> 02:37:05.249
AND IF IT'S NOT. THEN I SUGGEST

02:37:05.315 --> 02:37:07.484
THAT WE TAKE ANOTHER VIEW AND

02:37:07.551 --> 02:37:10.454
REQUIRE- MORE ACCOUNTABILITY

02:37:10.521 --> 02:37:12.623
AND OVERSIGHT OF CDC ARE- AS IT

02:37:12.689 --> 02:37:14.558
INTERPRETS THE LAWS THAT THE

02:37:14.625 --> 02:37:17.060
LEGISLATURE MAKES AND DOES

02:37:17.127 --> 02:37:17.928
CERTAINLY HAVE A MORE ROBUST

02:37:17.995 --> 02:37:21.832
DISCUSSION- SO. I AM. I AM

02:37:21.899 --> 02:37:23.600
HOPEFUL THAT GOING FORWARD THIS

02:37:23.667 --> 02:37:25.068
IS BEEN A MEANINGFUL

02:37:25.135 --> 02:37:29.339
OPPORTUNITY TO IDENTIFY JUST

02:37:29.406 --> 02:37:31.809

PEOPLE WHO IDENTIFIED AS

02:37:43.754 --> 02:37:45.889
