WE'LL START WITH ISSUE FIVE. GREAT THEY DIDN'T TAKE HIM ON CHAIR GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS SAM A SUB- DIRECTOR OF THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF BINDING IN RESEARCH THANK YOU TO THE COMMITTEE COMMITTEE AND CHAIR FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT- CHAOS BUDGET PROPOSALS INCLUDING EDUCATION PRECISION MEDICINE PROPOSED NEW OFFICE OF COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIPS AND STRATEGIC COMMUNICATIONS. CALIFORNIA VOLUNTEERS AND LEGISLATIVE. I'LL START WITH THE FIRST ISSUE ITEM WHICH IS OPR EDUCATION PROPOSAL LEARNING LAB FOR SALE WAS ESTABLISHED BY THE BUDGET ACT OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN TO IMPROVE LEARNING OUTCOMES AND CLOSE EQUITY GAPS ON OUR PUBLIC COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES SPECIALLY THE KINDS OF GAPS WE SEE FOR UNDERREPRESENTED STUDENTS. INTERESTED IN PURSUING STEM FIELDS. SOUND IS NOW EARLY IN ITS FOURTH YEAR OF OPERATION. IT HAS AWARDED ALMOST TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS TO FIND THIRTY NINE INNOVATIVE FACULTY LED PROJECTS TO IMPROVE TEACHING LEARNING AND STUDENT ACCESS. THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF FACULTY WHO ARE TAKING PART IN THIS PROJECTS THAT ARE TOUCHING THE LIVES OF TENS OF THOUSANDS OF STUDENTS. WHILE THE STATE IS INVESTING IN STUDENT SUCCESS IN A VARIETY OF WAYS TO HELP YOU NEWLY UNIQUELY WEAVES TOGETHER THE SCIENCE OF HUMAN LEARNING. THAT IS HOW STUDENTS ACTUALLY LEARN. THE POWER OF TECHNOLOGY THROUGH HYBRID AND ONLINE LEARNING AND THE VALUES OF DIVERSITY EQUITY AND INCLUSION TO HELP BUILD A MORE DYNAMIC DIVERSE WORKFORCE THAT CAN HELP THE STATE MEET THE CHALLENGES OF THE FUTURE. THE BUDGET INCLUDES TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS ONE TIME GENERAL FUND FOR A GRANT. TO THE CARNEGIE SCIENCE CLIMATE RESEARCH CLUB FACULTY IN PASADENA. THE BUDGET ALSO INCLUDES THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS ONE TIME GENERAL FUND FOR THE CALIFORNIA EDUCATION LEARNING LAB THREE STYLISH THE GOLDEN STATE AWARDS GRANT PROGRAM FOR THE PURPOSE OF INCENTIVIZING CELEBRATING AND ELEVATING HIGH IMPACT. INNOVATIONS CREATED IN- IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WE HAVE WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- STAFF AVAILABLE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS SPECIFIC TO THESE TWO PROPOSALS THAT YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU. MAN STATE YOU WOULD LIKE TO PROVIDE. AS DEPARTMENT FINANCE ON. SO WHEN I THE PRIME TIME BRIAN DAHLE JEEZ RIGHT. AND YES BRIAN WHEN- IF YOU TO HEAR FROM THE OF FINANCE FIRST FINE OTHERWISE I'D GO HEAD RELIGIOUS DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE PROPOSALS AS OUTLINED BY THE DIRECTOR. AND WE'RE OPEN FOR QUESTIONS. OKAY GREAT THEY MAY COME TO YOU OKAY NOW WILL HAVE THE OTHER BRIAN. HI GOOD AFTERNOON THIS SPRING WHETHER FORD AT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE ARE A FULL ANALYSIS OF THIS THESE ITEMS AND- SEVERAL OTHER KEY APPEAR BUDGET PROPOSALS I JUST WANTED TO KNOW WILL BE PUBLISHED ON OUR WEBSITE AS A BUDGET POST AT THREE PM TODAY. I JUST WANT TO APOLOGIZE THAT GIVEN THE BUDGET ELSE'S TIME FRAME THIS YEAR WE WERE UNABLE TO PROVIDE OUR ANALYSIS IN ADVANCE. COME ON THE HIGHER EDUCATION PROPOSALS- WE RECOMMEND REJECTING THE PROPOSED GOLDEN STATE AWARDS PROPOSAL BECAUSE IT'S FUNDAMENTALLY POOR DESIGN- WE'VE PREVIOUSLY NOTED ON. THAT IN- PRIOR- WORD INITIATIVES HAVE HAD SHORTCOMINGS AND THIS. THIS PROPOSAL. HAS SOME SIMILAR- ISSUES ONE SHORTCOMING IS THAT THE PROPOSAL WOULD. PROVIDE RELATIVELY LARGE SUMS TO A SMALL NUMBER OF RECIPIENTS WITHOUT ANY CLEAR MECHANISM FOR DISSEMINATING BEST PRACTICES AND WE HAVE A RELATED CONCERN THAT THE PROPOSAL DOES NOT PROVIDE A CLEAR PLAN FOR SUSTAINING. AND SCALING THE SELECTED ACTIVITIES DISSEMINATING THE ACTIVITIES MORE BROADLY COULD POTENTIALLY CREATE CONSIDERABLE FUTURE COST PRESSURES FOR THE STATE. AND WE REYES ALSO CONCERNS THAT- REWARDING EXISTING ACTIVITIES HAS LIMITED ADDED VALUE- FINAL CONCERNS SPECIFIC TO THIS PROPOSAL WHICH IS- IT IT HAS A BROADER SCOPE THAN PRIOR WORD PROPOSALS RANGING FROM HIGHER EDUCATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE TO ANY OTHER AREA OF INTEREST THE ADMINISTRATION. AND THIS LACK OF FOCUS ON THE CERTAINLY WOULD UNDERMINE THE INITIATIVES ABILITY TO MEANINGFULLY IMPACT ANYONE AREA THE BROAD SCOPE ALSO MEANS THE PROGRAM LIKELY OVERLAPS WITH OTHER EXISTING STATE EFFORTS SO FOR EXAMPLE THE STATE HAS FUNDED RESEARCH ON CLIMATE RELATED. ISSUES THROUGH OTHER PROGRAMS AND DEPARTMENTS. AND THAT CONCLUDES MY COM ON THESE I BUT I HAPPY TO. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. OKAY THANK YOU I THINK BEFORE I GO FORWARD I'D LIKE TO MAKE TWO COMMENTS ONE SENATOR CABALLERO HAS. JOINED US FOR THE ROLE. SHE SHOULD STATE SHE'S PRESENT- CABALLERO. AND I ALSO WANT TO- SHARE THAT I'D- SIMULTANEOUSLY SERVE ON RULES WHICH IS HAPPENING AT THE SAME TIME RIGHT ABOVE US SO THERE MAY BE MOMENTS WHEN I HAVE TO STEP OUT AND I WILL EXTEND THE GAVEL TO OUR VICE CHAIR- SO WITH THAT WE WILL NOW OPEN THE DISCUSSION TO QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE- SENATOR HOW I'LL GO TO MY VICE CHAIR FOR SENATOR NELSON DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS CHAIR OF THIS COMMITTEE DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS. YES MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU VERY MUCH- ON THIS ONE I HAD A REALLY HARD TIME UNDERSTANDING EXACTLY WHAT WAS. ANTICIPATED IN THE LEARNING LAB PORTION OF THE OF THE GRANT PROPOSAL- I KNOW IT PEDAGOGICAL MEANS BUT WHEN WE START TALKING IN. IN FACT YOU KNOW WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE TERMS ARE UNDERSTANDABLE NOT ONLY FOR US BUT ALSO THE PUBLIC THE TAKES A LOOK AT THIS AND SAYS- I THINK INNOVATION GRANTS ARE TERRIFIC. BUT BUT I REALLY AM INTERESTED IN WHAT ARE THE OUTCOMES THAT WE'RE EXPECTING FROM DOING THESE GRANTS I'M AND I THINK A LOT OF TIMES WE CREATE. PROGRAMS AND WE DON'T HAVE STATED WHAT THE OUTCOMES ARE AND I'M GONNA START ASKING- THAT QUESTION A LOT MORE IN THE FUTURE BECAUSE I'M NOT SURE WE'RE GETTING GOOD BANG FOR THE BUCK FOR WHAT WE'RE SPENDING IN MANY IN MANY AREAS INSTANCES IN AREAS SO I'M UP TOTALLY COMMITTED TO STEM RESEARCH AND UP. UP UP. CELEBRATING YOU KNOW VICTORIES BUT FOR EXAMPLE THERE WAS A PROGRAM THAT THAT FOCUSED ON STEM. AND ONE OF THE GRANTS WENT TO A COMMUNITY COLLEGE A CREATED A THREE YEAR COMPUTER SCIENCE BE A PROGRAM WITH A LOCAL- CSU AND SO THAT HEADS AS SOME REAL OUTCOMES AND SOME REAL SUCCESS STORIES. BECAUSE OF THAT THAT THAT PROGRAM WAS. WAYS IT COULD BE BETWEEN A COMMUNITY COLLEGE IN SALINAS SENSE AND THAT. CAL STATE MONTEREY BAY AND THEY TOOK. YOUNG PEOPLE FROM OUR COMMUNITY AND WITHIN THREE YEARS AHEAD OF WORKING IN THE SILICON VALLEY EARNING OVER A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR AND A MAJORITY OF THOSE WERE LIKE YOU KNOW. AND AFRICAN AMERICAN YOUNG YOUNG PEOPLE WHO WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO THAT- BEFORE SO THAT HAS AN OUTCOME AND SO I'M I'M I'M INTERESTED IN IN IN THAT KIND OF- DETAIL AT WHEN WE WHEN WE START TALKING ABOUT. ABOUT THESE KINDS OF PROGRAMS. THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATOR RON QUESTION OKAY- I WOULD JUST LIKE SENATOR NIELSEN IF I MAY THIS IS COME TO MIND THE- THIRTEEN MILLION DOLLARS OR P. R.'S BECOME QUITE A- IN MY TERM. BLOATED BUREAUCRACY. IT HAD A VERY NARROW PURPOSE FOR MANY YEARS AND NOW IT'S GONE WAY BEYOND THAT IN MY OPINION. NOW ONE OF THE PROPOSALS IS THE LEARNING LAB. AND. SOME OF THE. ROOT CAUSES OR STEM ISSUES. AMONG GROUPS. I DON'T KNOW THAT THIS IS GOING TO DEAL WITH IT. THE QUESTION I HAVE THEN WHY WOULD WITH WHAT JUSTIFIES. MAKING THE THIRTEEN MILLION ON GOING FUNDING. YOUR PERMANENT OBLIGATION OF OUR BUDGET WHY WHY IS THAT NECESSARY. CAN SOMEONE FINANCE GIVE ME A THOUGHT. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION CENTER ALL ALL JUST CLARIFY THAT SORT PROPOSAL IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET IS FOR THREE MILLION ONGOING. FOR THE LEARNING LAB WHICH IS B. AS YOU SAID BASTED OPR THE TWO MILLION WOULD TWO MILLION OF THAT THREE WOULD BE TO RESTORE A DRAMATIC BUDGET CUTS THE RESULTED FROM THE TWENTY TWENTY BUDGET ACT- SO THAT'S THAT'S OUR- OUR VIEW IS THAT THAT'S NEEDED TO BRING THE PROGRAM UP TO WHERE IT WAS WHEN IT WAS AN INVASION. SO THERE IS AN ADDITIONAL ONE MILLION THEY WERE PROPOSING TO AUGMENT THAT WOULD BE TO FIND A PROGRAM THAT IS CURRENTLY COME OUT OF THE EXISTING CELL GRANTS. AND WE SEE AS A GREAT SUCCESS IT'S SPECIFICALLY WOULD MAKE LOWER DIVISION CHEMISTRY COURSES- BASICALLY HELP TEXTBOOK COSTS FALL O ALMOST ZERO MAKE THE MORE CULTURALLY RESPONSIVE AND- BE DESIGNED IN A NEW- INNOVATIVE WAY THAT'S GONNA HELP- PROMOTE STEM IN GENERAL AND ALTERNATELY HIGH PAID JOBS FOR CALIFORNIANS. SO FOR US THIS ONE MILLION IT'S CURRENTLY BEEN A ONE TIME GRANT T. MAKING IT ONGOING THAT'S GOING TO CREATE BIG- COST SAVINGS FOR STUDENTS EVENTUALLY SO FOR THE EDUCATION SIDE THIS. IS A BIG EXCITING PROPOSAL. YOUR EXPECTING THE WE THE COMMITTEE SHOULD NOT RE EVALUATE THAT EVERY SINGLE YEAR. IT SHE LIKE THAT ME VERY IRRESPONSIBLE WHAT. ON IN TERMS OF ACCOUNTABILITY AS THE GOVERNING OF DOES PUT OUT ANNUAL REPORTS IN TERMS OF ITS ACTIVITIES AND- PROVIDES DETAILS ON ITS ITS GRAND SIX CENTER AND THIS WOULD WOULD BE BAKED INTO THEIR- YOU KNOW THEY PROVIDE UPDATES. BUT THE POINT I MAKE IS REPORTS. FOR ME OR JUST KIND OF NONSENSE. IT'S COVERING THE BASE PRETENDING THAT YOU'RE REALLY DOING SOMETHING WHAT ARE THE PERFORMANCE STANDARDS THAT YOU'RE GOING TO IMPOSE HERE. THE CRITERIA. TO JUSTIFY YOUR ACTIONS THE BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE WE PROPOSE TO DO THIS TWO MILLION RESTORATION OF TWENTY TWENTY CUTS IN THE ONE MILLION AUGMENTATION FOR THECHEMISTRY FOCUSED OUR UNDERGRADUATE INNOVATIVE PLATFORM THAT DAD WE DON'T HAVE IN BBL WE DON'T HAVE DETAILED PERFORMANCE METRICS THE JUSTIFICATION THERE IS THAT IT'S ESSENTIALLY A PILOT PROGRAM THAT WE'RE PROPOSING TO SCALE. AND SO THEY ARE IN THE IT PART OF THE PROPOSAL IS THAT IN THE FIRST YEAR OF PERMANENT FUNDING THEY WOULD BUILD OUT A MULTI YEAR PLAN- SO WE'RE THEY'RE SORT OF PUTTING TOGETHER FROM PILOT TO SCALING PHASE AND THINKING THROUGH WHAT METRICS MIGHT EVEN- HE ACHIEVABLE. THANK YOU SIR I DON'T BUY THAT AT ALL BUT THANK YOU FOR YOUR ANSWER. THANK YOU SENATOR NELSON I AM. JUST QUICKLY WANT TO ECHO SOME OF THE- THOUGHTS AND CONCERNS FROM MY COLLEAGUES. SINCE WE DON'T EVEN NOW IF THIS IS GONNA WORK- THE QUESTION IS A Y. HERE BECAUSE I DON'T THINK THEY'RE ANY. IS NOT DRIVEN BY ANY KIND OF STATUTORY RESPONSIBILITIES SO THAT'S THE FIRST QUESTION WHY NO PR AND THEN THE SECOND QUESTION IS IF WE DON'T EVEN KNOW IF IT WILL WORK Y. AS SEEMS PRETTY PRESUMPTION WAS TO. ASK FOR ON GOING FUNDING. FINANCE. I APPRECIATE THE QUESTIONS IN ALL JUST ALL ASSUME WE'RE STILL AND NOT MY APOLOGIES IF THIS IS NOT CORRECT BUT I'M ASSUMING WE'RE GOING TO STILL TALK ABOUT THE- THREE MILLION ONGOING PROPOSED FOR THE LEARNING LAB SPECIFICALLY. AND SO FOR THE AT TWO MILLION RESTORATION. OUR OWN IT WHICH IS THE BIGGEST PIECE OF IT. THE CELL LEARNING LAB WAS CREATED IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN- THE TRAILER BILL TO THE BUDGET ACT AB EIGHTEEN OH NINE. AND THE ORIGINAL GRANT POOL THAT THEY HAD TO PROVIDE INTERSECTING FACULTY GROUPS- AGGRESSIVE- INNOVATIVE LIKE STEM FOCUSED. SHIFTS IN TEACHING AND EDUCATING UNDERGRADUATES THAT GRANT POOL WAS AT TEN MILLION THEY WERE LATER CUT DOWN TO EIGHT MILLION SO WE'RE SENSUALLY TRYING TO PROPOSE LET'S GO BACK TO HOW THE PROGRAM WAS ORIGINALLY THAT'S THE BIGGEST PIECE OF THIS PROPOSAL THE SECOND PIECE WHICH I IT SOUNDS LIKE SENATORS ARE CONCERNED WE'RE FOCUSED ON IS THE AUGMENTATION TO TAKE ONE OF THE CURRENT GRANTEES MAKE IT ON GOING- WE ACKNOWLEDGE THE CONCERNS YOU'RE YOU'RE VOICING. BUT IN OUR VIEW THIS IS AN EXCITING OPPORTUNITY SPECIFICALLY IN THE HIGHER ED WORLD FOR US THINGS THAT OTHERWISE WE WOULDN'T HAVE THIS TYPE OF INTERSEGMENT ALL COLLABORATION HAPPENING WITHOUT THIS PROGRAM. I SEE MISS LARK PARK HAS HER HAND UP. I THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I JUST WANTED TO ADD ON- THE ONE MILLION- AUGMENTATION ONGOING AUGMENTATION THAT'S BEING REQUESTED FOR ONE OF OUR OUR GRANT PROJECTS THERE ARE REALLY THREE DIMENSIONS OF VALUE THAT THIS PARTICULAR PROJECT HAS THAT ARE UNIQUE ONE IS ABOUT COST TO STUDENTS ABOUT TAX THE COST TO STUDENTS- VERY VERY MANY STUDENTS TAKE GENERAL CHEMISTRY IN THESTATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND SO HAVING SOMETHING OF THAT IS FREE FOR THEM THAT COULD BE UNIFORMLY USE ACTUALLY HAS A MULTIPLE AND- RATIO VALUE IN TERMS OF THE STATE'S INVESTMENT A SECOND DIMENSION OF VALUE IS- THAT ADHD. FIVE IS- IT CORPORATE CULTURALLY RESPONSIVE CULTURALLY SUSTAINING MATERIALS WITHIN THE COURSE AND ONE OF THINGS THAT MANY OF OUR GRANTEES- ARE WORKING ON IT IS STUDENTS SENSE OF BELONGING ESPECIALLY FOR UNDER RECORDS SENATE STUDENTS. AND BAGS- HAVING STUDENTS- MAINTAIN THEIR PATHWAY TO SPAM- WHEN THEY ARE AT RISK RIGHT UNDER UNDER REPRESENTATIVE OR FEEL LIKE THEY'RE IN THE MINORITY- IS SOMETHING THAT WE THINK CAN ACTUALLY HAVE A GREAT VALUE IN KEEPING STUDENTS ON A STEM PATHWAY THAT WILL THEN NEED TO THE STEM JOBS THE THIRD IS- TECHNOLOGY VALUE WHICH IS REALLY-MAKING USE OF. NEW TECHNOLOGIES ADAPTIVE LEARNING TECHNOLOGIES. TO AND WE BELIEVE THAT THIS IS THIS IS CUTTING EDGE AND HOW A LOT OF LEARNING TO BE DONE IN THE FUTURE AND SAID THIS PROJECT ACTUALLY REPRESENTS A COMBINATION OF UNIQUE VALUES I THAT I AT THAT ARE AT THE CUTTING EDGE. OF EDUCATION. RIGHT THE DOUBLES ALWAYS IN THE DETAILS SO. CENTER NIELSEN. LET ME TRYTHAT THIS DEBATE AGAIN AND- RESPECTFULLY I HAVE GOT TO RESPOND USE THE WORD FREE. I KIND OF TAKE OFFENSE AT THIS FREE. BUT BUT HERE'S THE POINT GETTING BACK TO YOUR A WARNING ANY PERFORMANCE STANDARDS STRICT STANDARDS- LET THINGS JUST WORK OUT WE'LL SEE. IF THERE'S ANYTHING THAT'S BEEN VERY EVIDENT HERE IN CALIFORNIA IS THAT WE JUST STATE THE HIGH TECH CAPITAL OF THE WORLD CANNOT GET IT RIGHT. THE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN. TAXES AFTER TECHNOLOGICAL UPGRADES IN OUR- VARIOUS AGENCIES YOU NAME THE AGENCY. FISCAL MILLION THE MOST RECENT. THESE PROJECTS DO NOT COME IN ON BUDGET. THE ALWAYS GET EXPANDED SOMEWHERE ALONG THE WAY CONTRACTS GET AMENDED. IT'S AN EMBARRASSMENT. THE STATE SENATE ITSELF THE COMMUNICATIONS CONTINUE TO BREAK DOWN. THE NEW BUILDING THAT WE ARE NOW OCCUPIED. I DON'T WANT TO SAY IT'S A DISASTER BUT LET'S JUST SAY IT'S NOT VERY FUNCTIONAL AT THIS POINT. AND WE'RE SPENDING A LOT OF MONEY AT IT. GETS BACK TO MY POINT THAT I WANT TO SEE DELIVERABLES. WANT TO SEE CONSEQUENCES IF THE PROVIDER. THE CONTRACTOR DOES NOT. DELIVER AND THAT THAT BE WRITTEN INTO OUR CONTRACTS. WE'VE GOT TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO GET IT RIGHT TECHNOLOGY AND I DO NOT KNOW IF THAT'S THE CURRENT. NAME OF THAT AGENCY. IT'S SINGULAR ACHIEVEMENT OVER THE DECADES IS JUST BEEN TO KEEP CHANGING ITS NAME. BUT HASN'T MADE ANYTHING BETTER NOW SHOULD WE IMPOSE SOME STANDARDS ON THAT AGENCY THAT IS SUPPOSED TO THE FACT GREATER EFFICIENCY. AND DELIVERY OF THESE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS A PROJECT ABSOLUTELY. SO I JUST HAVE TO SAY I'M GOING TO BE OF. VERY RESISTANT- TO THIS PROPOSAL THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU SENATOR THANK YOU VICE CHAIR AND I JUST HAVE TWO QUICK QUESTIONS ONE HOW WAS THE CARNEGIE SCIENCE- HUB IDENTIFIED. AND I GUESS THIS IS THE FOR FINANCE OR OPR- BRIAN COULD RESPOND TO THAT AGAIN FROM D. O. F. THANK YOU DIRECTOR SERVER. BROWN RELIGIOUS DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SO THE CARNEGIE SCIENCE. THEY'RE THEY'RE LOOKING TO CONSOLIDATE OPERATIONS FOCUSED ON ENVIRONMENT AND CLIMATE. IN PASADENA AND DAVE THEY'VE ESTIMATED A HUNDRED TWENTY MILLION AS THE TOTAL COST FOR A NEW FACILITY THAT WOULD HOUSE THIS THIS CONSOLIDATION OF EXISTING STAFF AND EXPANDING STAFF. HI WE'RE EXCITED ABOUT LOCATING THAT IN CALIFORNIA. AND IT WAS DETERMINED THAT IS ESSENTIALLY THEY HAVE PRIVATE FUNDS A CAMPAIGN GOING ON NOW CAPITAL CAMPAIGN FOR THE FACILITY- THAT THE STATE. COULD COULD I WOULD COULD MAKE A CRITICAL CONTRIBUTION WITH TWENTY MILLION- OUR OUR VIEW IS THAT WE'RE WE'RE NOT AWARE OF THE EXACT AMOUNT OF PRIVATE FUNDING THEY HAVE AT THIS POINT WE KNOW THAT ARE TWENTY MILLION WOULD NOT SUPPLANT IN THE EXISTING FARMS SO THAT THIS WOULD ACTUALLY BE CRITICAL TO THEM. PULLING THIS OFF SO WE ARE FORWARD IN THE CLIMATE CHANGE MITIGATION AND ADAPTATION. AGENDA FOR THE STATE. ALSO JUST ADDED I MEAN IT'S IMPORTANT CONTEXT THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS A BIG. CLIMATE PACKAGE THIS BUDGET THERE'S BILLIONS ACROSS. EVERY AREA FROM HOUSING TRANSPORTATION HIGHER EDUCATION ETCETERA- AND SO THIS TWENTY MILLION IS JUST. IN OUR VIEW JUST SORT OF A SMALL PIECE OF THE- LET'S LET'S ADVANCE RESEARCH LABS- TRANSITION JOBS ETCETERA SO THIS IS LIKE A BIG. PART OF A BIGGER VISION. I APPRECIATE THAT THERE ARE HUNDREDS I'M SURE OF OTHER CORPORATIONS AND NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS DOING WORK IN THE CLIMATE SPACE SO THE QUESTION IS REALLY COULD BE- SELECTION OF THE CARNEGIE SCIENCE HUB STAND UP TO SCRUTINY IF FOLKS WANTED TO KNOW. WHY THEY WERE SELECTED OVER SOMEONE ELSE. SO THEN THE LAST THE SECOND QUESTION IS THEIR CRITERIA FOR THE GOLDEN STATE AWARDS GRANT PROGRAM BECAUSE SIMILAR TO THE COMMENTS OF SENATOR CABALLERO EVERYONE LOVES INNOVATION GRANTS. AND COMPETITIVE GRANTS BUT YOU ALSO HAVE TO HAVE CRITERIA AND GUARDRAILS AND SOME TRANSPARENCY AROUND HOW THOSE ARE GOING TO BE- WHAT THEY ARE AND HOW THEY WILL BE. SORT OF- OPERATIONALIZED SO I KNOW THIS IS A HOLD OPEN ITEM YOU MIGHT NOT HAVE ALL THE ANSWERS BUT- YOU'LL HAVE TO GET ON. WE APPRECIATE THAT I CAN JUST OFFER OUR OUR OUR PROPOSAL AS IT STANDS IN BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE. THE THERE'S TWO WAYS THAT THE- THE THIRTY MILLION ONE TIME GENERAL FUND. WORDS WOULD ESSENTIALLY BEEF. END UP IN GRANTEES HANDS THE FIRST FILTER WOULD BE WE HAVE SOME ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA- WE CALL OUT IN BBL THAT- POTENTIAL ELIGIBLE- INDIVIDUALS OR TEAMS FOR NOMINATIONS WOULD INCLUDE INSTRUCTORS AT PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES- RESEARCHERS. THAT THEY WORK ON CLIMATE CHANGE THE OTHER BIG FILTER IS THAT THE SELECTION COMMITTEE B. B. L. SPECIFIES THERE'D BE TWELVE COMMITTEE MEMBERS ON THE SELECTION COMMITTEE THEY WOULD COME FROM A BROAD RANGE OF. RAFEAL SAID IN A STAPLER GROUP SO WE HAVE A BUNCH OF EXPERTISE THERE- IT DELEO HAS CRITICIZED THIS AS TOO BROAD IN OUR VIEW THAT'S THE STRENGTH WE THINK THAT HAVING A SELECTION COMMITTEE FROM MULTIPLE PERSPECTIVES. IS GONNA BE HOW THIS THIS OFFERS- THE WAY OF IDENTIFYING STATEWIDE CONCERNS THAT THAT NEED RECOGNITION FOR PLACES WHERE INNOVATION IS HAPPENING- SO- THAT'S THAT'S PROBABLY NOT SATISFACTORY IN TERMS OF THE THEIR WINTER RACING BUT I THINK THAT'S OUR PERSPECTIVE. WELL YOU KNOW WE ALWAYS HAVE TO HAVE A STARTING POINT SO- WE'RE NEXUS SINCE I DON'T SEE ANY OTHER FOLKS INTERESTED IN COMMENTING WE'RE GONNA MOVE ON TO THE NEXT DISCUSSION ITEM WHICH IS ISSUE NUMBER SIX. PRECISION MEDICINE PROPOSALS- OPR WOULD YOU LIKE TO START US OFF. YES THANK YOU NUMMINEN CHAIR- AS PART OF OPR CALIFORNIA INITIATIVE TO ADVANCE THE PRECISION MEDICINE PROGRAM OR- KNOWN AS SITE COM. WILL REQUESTING ABOUT TEN MILLION DOLLARS IN ONE TIME GENERAL FUNDS TO PROVIDE. GRANTS FOR PROJECTS FOCUSING SPECIFICALLY ON DEPRESSION. OUR DATA PLUG THAT PRECISION MEDICINE APPROACH TO USING BETA IN COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SETTINGS. A STRONG FOCUS FOCUS OF THIS RESEARCH PROGRAM WITH THE GOALS OF HEALTHEQUITY INCLUDING REQUIREMENTS TO PARTNER WITH- COMMUNITIES AND- PRIORITIZE RESEARCH THAT DRIVES PROGRESS. IN PROVIDING SOLUTIONS FOR- DISPROPORTIONATELY UNDERSERVED AREA THE GRANTS WILL AWARD- APPROXIMATELY THREE TO FIVE PROJECTS APPLYING A PRECISION MEDICINE APPROACH TO USING USING DATA IN COUNTY BEHAVIORAL. HEALTH SETTINGS- AND PARTNERING WITH COMMUNITIES AND PRIORITIZING RESEARCH AGAIN THAT PROVIDES SOLUTIONS FOR- DISPROPORTIONATELY. UNDERSERVED AREAS. WE ARE ALSO READ. NINE THREE DOLLARS DURING- PARTS OF UNDER REPRESENTED. IN BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH TO LEAD AND I'M INTERNET AGENCY COOPERATION TO DEVELOP BEST PRACTICES CREATE PROMOTIONAL MATERIALS AND HOST EVENTS TO RAISE AWARENESS AND INCREASED. PARTICIPATION AMONG UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA HEALTH AND MEDICAL RESEARCH STUDIES THE FIVE YEAR PROJECT WILL. JUMPSTART A BROAD PUBLIC PRIVATE COALITION TO IMPROVE APPROACHES TO ENGAGING DIVERSE COMMUNITIES IN RESEARCH AND DIVERSE TO ENSURE THAT NEXT GENERATION MEDICINES AND DISEASE PREVENTION STRATEGIES THAT BENEFIT ALL CALIFORNIANS. I HAVE- AND STOP BY A CO DIRECTOR JULIAN AND A CALL HERE FROM SITE COM AT TO SIR ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MAY HAVE THANK YOU. THANK YOU I. THINK NOW WE'RE GOING TO HEAR FROM DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. KEVIN CLARK WITH BERMAN OF FINANCE- WE JUST MIRROR- PR'S ARE COMMENTS ON THIS SUMMER HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS AS WELL. OKAY GREAT EN LA- WOULD YOU LIKE TO PROVIDE ANY COMMENT AGAIN WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE SO WE HAVEN'T DEVELOPED- I'LL TRY TO KEEP IT FREE I WEEK WE HAVE A DEVELOP SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS ON THE DEPRESSION RESEARCH COMPOSITION RESEARCH PROPOSAL BECAUSE- WE GENERALLY FIND IT CHALLENGING TO EVALUATE THESE PRECISION MEDICINE PROPOSALS GIVEN THE LACK OF A STATE WIDE FRAMEWORK FOR PRIORITIZING THE ALLOCATION OF STATE FUNDING. FOR SPECIFIC RESEARCH MEDICINE TOPICS OVER OTHER RESEARCH AREAS ARE GENERAL FUNDING FOR ACADEMIC RESEARCH- THAT'S IN AND WE HAVE SOME LONGSTANDING CONCERNS ABOUT THE PRECISION MEDICINE RESEARCH. AREA THAT THAT THAT WE PROVIDED IN THE PAST SO I'M A BELIEVER THAT POINT. I WILL- MENTION IN THE AGENDA THAT. IS MENTIONED IN THE AGENDA THE INSTITUTE EVENTS PRECISION MEDICINE IS JUSTIFIED CONTINUED- STATE FUNDING FOR SELECTED AREAS OF PRECISION MEDICINE TO HELP PLUG GAPS IN THE FEDERALLY FUNDED RESEARCH. THAT IT RECEIVES BUT- ON THE ADMINISTRATION'S NOT SUPPORTED THIS WITH A DETAILED GAP ANALYSIS HELP US UNDERSTAND THE NEED FOR FUNDING CERTAIN. AREAS OF RESEARCH OVER OTHERS WE DO HOWEVER FIND THAT THE PROPOSAL TO INCREASE THE FIRST PARTICIPATION AND BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH PROJECTS COULD HAVE MERIT. SOME GROUPS HAVE BEEN HISTORICALLY TO REPRESENTED IN BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH IN THIS IS LIKE TO DOCUMENT AND HEALTH DISPARITIES. WELL THIS EFFORT COULD POSSIBLY DUPLICATE OTHER FEDERALLY LED EFFORTS TO INCREASE PARTICIPATION IN THE STUDIES NATIONALLY. THIS PROPOSAL- APPEARS THAT IT WOULD BE FOR FOCUSED ON INCREASING PARTICIPATION AMONG THE DIVERSE COMMUNITIES WITHIN THE STATE SPECIFICALLY AND SO THERE MAY BE SOME BENEFIT TO HAVING AFFECTS. OKAY GREAT THANK YOU NOW- HI WE WILL OPEN UP FOR DISCUSSION QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MISTER VICE OKAY NOW ALL RIGHTS AND- CABALLERO. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- THAT THE QUESTION I HAVE IN REGARDS TO- THIS PARTICULAR PROPOSAL. IS- YOU KNOW THAT THE WORDS ALL SOUND REALLY GREAT I THINK THE QUESTION I HAVE IS- EXACTLY. EXACTLY HOW. THE A PRECISION MEDICINE APPROACH WELL FIRST OF ALL IS DOES THIS REALLY BELONG AN OPR. AT LEAST I UNDERSTAND THAT'S WHERE IT WOULD BE HOUSE- AND WHY IS IT NOT IN- IN OUR PUBLIC HEALTH FOR HEALTHSECTOR- AND THEN TO IS- IF IT IS IT IT IT IT APPEARS AT AYE AYE SUPPORT PROJECTS THAT REALLY THE FOCUS ON DEPRESSION AND I DON'T I THINK THERE CANNOT BE A BETTER TIME. FOR US TO FOCUS ON DEPRESSION- AND I'M- WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH RESOURCES. SO WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO FIGURE OUT. HOW WE HELP PEOPLE- AND SO THE IDEA OF DOING IT IT AND BROADER. IN IN TERMS OF- TREATMENTS THE TREATY GROUP AS OPPOSED TO INDIVIDUALS REALLY APPEALS TO ME AND SO I JUST I REALLY WOULD LIKE TO SEE A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT HOW- HOW WE USE PRECISION MEDICINE IN THIS PARTICULAR. INSTANCE GIVEN THAT AS I UNDERSTAND IT IT LOOKS AT GENETICS ENVIRONMENT AND LIFESTYLE TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE TREATMENT SHOULD BE AND- I'M NOT THE OUTCOMES THAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR AND EXACTLY WHAT ARE WE GONNA GET AFTER WE SPENT TEN MILLION DOLLARS. ARE ON ON A- ON A ON A PROJECT THAT THEY DON'T DETER ST A FIVE. THREE TO FIVE PROJECTS AND WHERE THOSE PROJECTS ARE LOCATED BECOMES REALLY IMPORTANT YES TWO YOU KNOW WHAT THE WHAT THE GROUPS OF INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE BEING STUDIED SO I GUESS I JUST NEED MORE INFORMATION ANDERSON EXACTLY HOW THIS. THIS PARTICULAR GRANT WOULD WORK. SO IS THE DETAIL IS IMPORTANT DETAILS ARE IMPORTANT MARIA- MAIL SENT. IF ON THAT AND THIS IS GOING TO BE IN ONGOING THING PRO. GET AN IDEA THE SOMETHING SOUNDS CONTEMPORARY INTERESTING TO THEM IMPORTANT OR AN AGENCY TO BUILD THIS BUREAUCRACY OR ITS BUDGET. AND ALL OF A SUDDEN THAT POPS UP IN MANY AGENCY BUDGETS. THROUGHOUT GOVERNMENT. AND IT'S PRETTY TOUGH FOR US TO KEEP TRACK OF IT. OUR SUB COMMITTEE CAN SCRUTINIZE IT. BUT THEN IT'S KINDA LOST IN THE SHUFFLE. AND THEN I WOULD ALSO ENCOURAGE THE LEDGE ANALYST BECAUSE I THINK THEY WOULD DO THAT WITH THE FURNACE THAT. OTHER ENTITIES WOULD NOT. WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR. IN THESE AREAS. RESEARCH AND APPLICATION THE PRECISION MEDICINE. WHY DOES IT ALL HAVE TO BE COME VESTED IN GOVERNMENT OR SO MUCH OF IT SO MANY MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. NOW THIS IS. BUDGET DUST MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. LADIES AND GENTLEMAN OUR BUDGETS PLURAL. DEPARTMENT BUDGETS ARE FULL. OF THESE GOOD IDEAS. SO I BELIEVE THAT THEY'RE GOING TO REQUIRE A LOT MORE SCRUTINY. AND A LOT MORE PRESCRIPTION PRESCRIPTION ON HOW MONIES ARE TO BE EXPENDED. BEFORE THE EGISLATURE SHOULD VOTE YES FOR MORE MONEY. SENATOR NIELSEN I MEAN SENATOR ROB. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- I GUESS I WILL MAKE A COUPLE COMMENTS YOU KNOW I WAS AROUND THE- I BELIEVE THAT THE INCEPTION- OF THIS PRECISION MEDICINE- JOURNEY IN THIS COMMITTEE AND I WAS. THOSE WHO WERE THERE AND- PEER AT THE TIME THEY RECALL- THAT I WAS SOMEWHAT CRITICAL OF THE PROPOSALS THEN. AS TO THE NATURE OF THE RESEARCH- PRECISION MEDICINE RESEARCH IN THE POTENTIAL IMPACT THAT. IT COULD OR WAS PROPOSED TO HAVE GIVEN OF COURSE THE LEVEL OF FUNDING. BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THROUGH THE- THE N. I. H. HOWEVER- THROUGH THE PASSAGE OF TIME I NOW RECOGNIZE THAT THE IN FACT GOVERNMENT HAS A ROLE. IN THIS TYPE OF INNOVATIVE ENERGY RESEARCH. AND THAT AS A STATE AS LARGE AS WE ARE IN THIS STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE CAN'T COUNT ON THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. TO DO THE SPECIFIC TYPE OF HEALTH RELATED RESEARCH THAT WE REALLY NEED IS A STATE. TO DO ARE HEALTH RELATED- PLANNING AND PROGRAMMING. AND AS TO METRIC SIDE YOU KNOW I CAME OUT OF THE MILITARY AND- THOSE OF YOU WHO'VE BEEN AROUND THE BUDGET. FOR THE TIME THAT I'VE BEEN HERE AND YOU'VE BEEN IN COMMITTEES THAT I'VE BEEN PRIVILEGED TO SIT ON YOU'VE HEARD ME. GIVE A LITTLE LECTURE PERIODICALLY ABOUT METRICS AND HELP METRICS ARE CRITICAL. IN ANYTHING WHERE WE SPEND MONEY HOWEVER. I ALSO THINK KIM BELIEVES THAT WITH THIS TYPE OF INNOVATIVE RESEARCH IT'S FAIRLY DIFFICULT. TO INSIST ON THE TYPE OF PERFORMANCE METRICS THAT I WOULD NORMALLY. OTHERWISE INSIST ON IN THE BUDGET PROCESS SO- I. I'M A BELIEVER AND I THINK THERE IS VALUE IN THIS RESEARCH IN THE MONEY THAT WE DIRECT TOWARD IT TO I BELIEVE IT IS HAD IMPACT SINCE. OF THE TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN BUDGET WHEN I WAS HERE ON THIS COMMITTEE AND I INTEND TO SUPPORT THIS PROPOSAL- IF AND WHEN IT COMES FORWARD FOR A VOTE THANK YOU MANAGER. THANK YOU SENATOR RUSS I DON'T HAVE ANY QUESTIONS- FOR. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- OR THE ALEJO'S OFFICE- BUT I SEE SAM YOU HAVE YOUR HAND REYES. A YES THANK YOU SENATORS OF THESE ARE ALL IMPORTANT QUESTIONS I JUST WANNA- I'M GOING TO CALL ON- A CHILLY AND MCCALL TO ANSWER SOME OF THE- BEST JUST A COUPLE OF- YOU KNOW THE Y. O. PR- SPECIFICALLY FOR THIS IN ONE OF THE ROLE. INSPECTION ROLE OF WILL BE OUR IS WORK ACROSS THE STATE AGENCIES SO WE WORK AND WORK WITH ACROSS. A BROAD- STAKEHOLDERS SO THAT IS PART OF THE ROLE OF OPR AND I WASN'T HERE WHEN. PRECISION MEDICINE WAS PUT IN THERE ARE BAD. I DO SEE THE ROLE AS AN AGENCY THAT IS CHARGED WITH. CONNECTING THE DOTS ON A LOT OF ISSUES- I BELIEVE IT MAKES SENSE THAT ON THE SECOND. PART I THINK- I BELIEVE COVER HOUSE ROLE IN THE SPECIFIC REDUCE ISSUES IN. RELEVANCE TRUE HEALTH DISPARITIES IN RESEARCH ON UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES. WE KNOW FROM THE PRIVATE SECTOR RESEARCH SIGNIFICANTLY LESS RESEARCH IS DONE ON PEOPLE OF COLOR AND SOME OF THE WORK THAT CYCLONE HAS DONE IS REALLY FOCUSED ON THAT. SO I JUST WANT TO PUT THAT UP BUT I'M GONNA CALL JULIAN MCCALL- CODIRECTOR SIDE COMES ON SIR- A COUPLE OF YOUR QUESTIONS IN TERMS OF WHY- WHY AROUND THE PROGRAM. THANK YOU. THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR. BYE AND UNDER AFTERNOON MA'AM CARE AND OF THE COMMITTEE- THERE ARE NUMBER OF QUESTIONS THAT THEIR SENSE- I WOULD. LOVE TO HEAR PROVIDE RESPONSES ALL OF THEM BUT I RESPECT YOUR TIME THE ONLY. A FEW. THE LACK OF MEASUREMENT FOR ACADEMIC RESEARCH IN FACT WE CONDUCT. A RIGOROUS EXTERNAL OUT OF STATE- EXPERT BODY PROCESS- CAN BRING TO LIGHT ALL OF THE- IMPACT OF THOSE PROJECTS AND WE MAINTAIN RELATIONSHIPS WITH EACH OF THOSE. RESEARCH TEAM- FIVE YEARS FOLLOWING THE CONCLUSION OF THE PROJECT IN ORDER TO CAPTURE ALL THE NEW PATENT. THE PATENT EXTENSIONS- THE NEW FTA- AT INNOVATION FOR EXAMPLE ONE OF OUR PROJECT- CONTRIBUTED TO THE FDA'S FIRST EVER APPROVAL OF AN IMAGING BIOMARKER- THERE ARE ALSO RESULT WHY. OUR RESEARCH CONTRIBUTED TO- THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BEING ABLE TO TRACK. HOW THE VIRUS MUTATING IN CALIFORNIA THE HARD CODED TO VIRUS- THAT WAS KIND OF A DREAM COME TRUE IMPACT FOR ANY RESEARCH. PROGRAMS WILL SUCCEED AND SEE THE IMPACT- SO. AFTER FINDING THAT WOULD ONLY FEW YEARS AFTER THAT PROJECT WAS FUNDED. ON WE ARE AT THE SENATOR NIELSEN SCOTT ABOUT- THE HEALTH SPREAD NAY- HOPE. AND GET HEALTH THAT HELP TO MISTER BY SUMMARY THAT MAKES THAT THOSE ARE PRO ARE RUSSIA- HUGH- ROAD. FOR THE GOVERNOR AND ASSISTED THE SURGEON GENERAL AND WRITING THE SURGEON GENERAL'S REPORT ALL ON THE SIDE LITERALLY IN THE EVENINGS AND WEEKENDS. TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT LED GOVERNOR GOVERNMENT'S PRIORITIES ARE ARE- IT COME TO FRUITION- AND IN TERMS OF WHY WE ARE NOT IN. ASIA ARE. YOU KNOW OPR OFFICE OF PLANNING AND RESEARCH WE LOOK AT THE OF OURSELVES AND PUTTING THE ART OPR- BUT WE ARE A TO THAT. RANGE OF WHAT STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS EXPERIENCING AND NEEDS AND THERE ARE NO RESEARCH SCIENTIST IN ANY OTHER AGENCY TO THE DEGREE THAT WE ARE FOCUSED. ON FOR ABLE TO BE NIMBLE ABLE TO RESPOND- IN AS QUICKLY AS RESEARCH. CAN AT OF HE JACKIE PLAN- INTO TWENTY EIGHTEEN WE- ARE- THE MATTER A REPORT PRECISION MEDICINE ASKING FOR HELP WHERE ALL OF STRATEGY INCLUDE THE NEW PROPOSAL ARE LAY OUT IN THE- THE SENATOR WILL WE APPRECIATE YOUR- SO LET'S USE THAT A LONG- ADVOCATE FOR- WE ADD TO ARE DEEPLY GREAT. FOR THE GUY ON A WHERE GO OUR NEXT OPPOSED. AND TO ANSWER ANY OTHER ANY OTHER HANDS RAISED FROM MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. THE SERVER CABALLERO NO JUST THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT INFORMATION I FOUND IT VERY VERY HELPFUL. CRUCIATUS THANK YOU. SO NOW WE'RE GOING TO MOVE ON TO THE NEXT DISCUSSION ITEM WHICH IS ISSUE NUMBER SEVEN COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIPS AND STRATEGIC COMMUNICATIONS OPR WOULD YOU LIKE TO GO FIRST. AND SET US UP SURE I'M SURE SO- THIS IS A NEW PROPOSED OFFICE WITHIN ALL PR AS PART OF THE TWENTY TWENTY CENSUS AND KOBE NINETEEN RESPONSE. THE STATE INVESTED IN BUILDING CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE INCLUDING ARTNERSHIPS WITH TRUSTED MESSENGERS ON THE GROUND THIS OUR COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS WILL ARE ON THE FRONTLINES OF ALL ALL OF THIS ISSUES. WHICH IS BANNED AND ALSO ROBUST DATA TOOLS AND STRATEGIC COMMUNICATIONS. TO ENCOURAGE CALIFORNIANS HARD TO REACH COMMUNITIES. THE SIXTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR PROPOSAL YOU KNOW I'M GOING FUNDING WOULD CREATE THE NEW OFFICE OF COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIPS AND STRATEGIC COMMUNICATIONS. THE MOUTHFUL I KNOW. AND THAT WOULD BUILD UPON THESE PRIOR EFFORTS BY IDENTIFYING AND MANAGING THE STATE'S HIGHEST PRIORITY PUBLIC AWARENESS AND COMMUNITY OUTREACH CAMPAIGNS. IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THE PROPOSED OFFICE WOULD ONLY FOCUS ON THE STATE'S HIGHEST PRIORITY PUBLIC EDUCATION. AND COMMUNITY OCT OUTREACH PROGRAMS THE OFFICE WOULD FACILITATE CLOSE COOPERATION ACROSS THE STATE DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES TO MAXIMIZE REACH AND IMPACT OF RESOURCES IN COMMUNITIES WITH THE HIGHEST HEALTH AND SOCIAL INEQUITIES. PROVIDE GRANT FUNDING TO COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND OTHER PARTNER OPENS ORGANIZATIONS AND CREATE A FEEDBACK LOOP OF COMMUNICATION AND INSIDE BETWEEN. COMMUNITIES PARTNERS AND RELEVANT DEPARTMENTS THE CREATION OF THE OFFICE WOULD ALLOW FOR A CONSISTENT AND TARGETED COMMUNICATION AND BUILD A STRONG NETWORK OF COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND PARTNERS. THE OFFICE WOULD LOOK FOR OPPORTUNITIES TO CREATE EFFICIENCIES THAT ADDRESS BARRIERS FACED BY CBO'S COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS THAT IS WITHOUT REDUCING. INVESTING IN EFFORTS LIKE THIS ARE IN THIS I BELIEVE IN THE STATE'S INTEREST AS IT WOULD PROVIDE. OPPORTUNITIES TO IMPROVE. SERVICE DELIVERY INCLUDING TO CALL OF HARD. TO REACH CA. ANY NEIGHBOR GREATER. ANIMAL EQUITABLE UP ON LOCATION STATE STAY SPENDING. LASTLY AS THE STATE CONTINUES ITS COMMITMENT TO EQUITY THE PROPOSAL OFFICE OF OFFICE. WOULD PROVIDE A KEY TRANSIT IN BAD EQUITY WITHIN OUR APPROACH TO TRUE AND MEANINGFUL COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIPS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE LEARN THROUGH CALLED IT AND A LOT OF THE CRISIS THAT WE GO THROUGH AS WELL AS EVERY TEN YEARS OR ON THE CENSUS. IS WE REACH OUT TO HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF CBO'S ORGANIZED I'M GET THE WORK DONE RESPOND EFFICIENTLY AND THEN WE DISBURSE AND THEN WE RECREATE DOT AGAIN AND AGAIN THIS IS AN IDEA THAT IS NOT ONLY IN CALIFORNIA BUT OTHER STATES TRYING TO LEARN. FROM HOW RESPONSIVE THEY HAVE BEEN THROUGH THE CORPORATE PROCESS HOW GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN RESPONSIVE IN A SHORT TIME AND THIS IS AN IDEA TO INSTITUTIONALIZED DOC KIND OF FUNCTION THAT HAS BEEN EXTREMELY EFFECTIVE. IN MY OPINION SO THAT IS THE PRIMARY PURPOSE OF THIS PROPOSED OFFICE AND- WILL BE HAPPY STATE QUESTIONS. I ALSO HAVE. WITH ME- EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE STRATEGIC GROWTH COUNCIL LADEN BANGKOK'S LABORED TO BILLS BEING EXTREMELY ENGAGED A STATEWIDE- WITHIN A PR AROUND COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENTS WHO IS VERY. KNOWLEDGEABLE AROUND- THIS ISSUES THAT WILL BE HAPPY. TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS NOW. THIS MEMBER HAVE ANY. AT THIS MOMENT. WE'RE GOING TO GO ON TO FINANCE AN L. A. O. CENTER CABALLERO. YES THIS PARTICULAR- ISSUE ITEM REFERENCES LESSONS LEARNED COULD YOU- PROVIDE TO THE COMMITTEE WHAT THE LESSONS LEARNED MORE FROM THE CENSUS AND THAT COVERED NINETEEN COMMUNICATION CAMPAIGNS WE SPEND A LOT OF MONEY ON BOTH OF THOSE CAMPAIGNS. AND I THINK IT WOULD BE HELP FOR HELPFUL FOR US TO KNOW A LOT OF THE OF THE CAMPAIGNS ARE CONTRACTS THAT WE PAY. TO BIG ORGANIZATIONS TO BIG- ENTITIES AND- AND WE SHOULD WE SHOULD KNOW WHAT'S WORKING AND WHAT'S NOT AND WHAT WE MIGHT WANT TO DO DIFFERENTLY. BECAUSE I THINK SOME OF THE PIECES OF THE CAMPAIGN WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE VERY GOOD IN OTHERS WERE JUST THE DISMAL FAILURE I'D LIKE TO SEE WITH THAT WITH THAT. THANK YOU THAT'S ALL I HAVE. THANK YOU AND I WILL- BUT THERE ARE LOTS OF LESSONS LEARNED AND I HAVE OTHER STUFF WHO HAVE BEEN ENGAGED IN THE CARPET- RESPONSE SO I'M GONNA COLD ARE THERE ANY BOARD LANE TO RESPOND TO THAT SPECIFIC QUESTION WHICH IS. REALLY IMPORTANT. I NEAR YOU ON THE CALL. THE NEW. I'M NOT SURE SHE'S ON THE CALL I'M NOW LIST A FEW OF THEM- ONE OF THE LESSONS LEARNED NOT ONLY AGAIN THE STATE BUT OTHER SOME LEARN THROUGH THE CORPORATE PROCESSES TO FALL FROM ONE FROM THE STATE'S PERSPECTIVE- I. WE HAVE BEEN VERY I DROUGHT AND QUICK IN OUR RESPONSE- THERE'S ALSO A LOT OF LESSONS LEARNED AROUND ENGAGING CBO'S- IN THE KIND OF RESOURCES THAT THEY NEED THE KINDS OF ENGAGEMENTS THAT THEY NEED AND WE WANT TO EXTEND OUT- AS A PERMANENT WAY OF SUPPORTING THAT PROCESS ALASKA LIMBONG CLOAKS ROCKETRY THE RESPOND SPECIFICALLY AND SOME SPECIFIC LESSONS LEARNED THROUGH THIS PROCESS. LENT THANK YOU THANK YOU DIRECTOR AND- THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATOR FOR THE QUESTION AND IT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT QUESTION AND A COUPLE OF THE LESSONS THAT WE LEARNED THROUGH THE EIGHTEENTH THE CENSUS THE VACCINE A NUMBER OF OTHER. COMMUNITY OUTREACH CAMPAIGNS IS AROUND THE IMPORTANCE OF HAVING TRUSTED PARTNERS TO HELP CARRY THE MESSAGE THE STATE FROM THE STAGE TO THE LOCAL COMMUNITY MEMBERS AND YOU KNOW MAKING SURE THAT THE INFORMATION IS CULTURALLY APPROPRIATE LINGUISTICALLY APPROPRIATE. AND ABLE TO YEAR TO COME FROM A MESSENGER WHO IS TRUST AND HAS AN EXISTING RELATIONSHIP IS MUCH MORE EFFECTIVE WHEN ESPECIALLY WHEN- CONVEYING CRITICAL IN IN INFORMATION THAT IS ALSO TIME BOUND. UP THE OTHER THING THE OTHER BIG LESSON I THINK THAT WE NEED NOTED FROM THESE PROCESS USES THE COMPLEXITY AND TO BE ABLE TO GET ACCESS TO COMMUNITY PARTNERS AND GOING THROUGH THE PROCESS OF STANDING UP AS STRUCTURE TO BE ABLE TO. VIAD RESOURCE INTO COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS IS COMPLEX. AND IT IS IT IS CHALLENGING AS TIME CONSUMING. AND SO BEING ABLE TO HAVE A STRUCTURE IN PLACE TO AWARD- EITHER GRANTS OR CONTRACTS TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THESE RESOURCES. IS A PROCESS THAT WE SHOULD BE LOOKING TO FIND WAYS TO MAKE THAT MORE EFFICIENT. AND THEN- I THINK THE OTHER THING TOO IS THAT THERE WE NEED TO LEARN THAT THE VIEW THE SUSTAINABILITY OF THE CBO'S. AS IT RELATES TO BEING ABLE TO- HAVE ONGOING STAFFING TO BE ABLE TO- PUT IN PLACE IS THE SYSTEMS THE STRUCTURES THE ONGOING RESOURCES TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THE ADEQUATE SUPPORT AND INFORMATION TO THEIR COMMUNITIES. IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF BEING ABLE TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT MESSAGING IS RECEIVED AND COMMUNICATED IN A TIMELY AND EFFICIENT FASHION. YOUR. SO ALL OF THAT'S VERY HELPFUL THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR ALL OF THAT'S VERY HOW HELPFUL BUT WE ALSO SPENT. I RECOLLECT CORRECTLY- ON THE CENSUS CLOSE TO FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IN ADVERTISING AND I'M I'M WONDERIG IF WE HAVE LESSONS LEARNED THERE ABOUT WHAT. WHAT WORKED AND WHAT DIDN'T AND WHAT WHAT KINDS OF COMMUNITIES AND I. I APPRECIATE YOUR RESPONSE RIGHT NOW I DIDN'T EXPECT IT RIGHT NOW I JUST WANTED IT GENERALLY AND THAT. FOR A WEST WE LOOK AT THIS PARTICULAR- ISSUE ITEM FOR THE FUTURE- I HAD. HE AND NUMBER OF THE MAYORS A VERY SMALL COMMUNITIES. PREPARE A LESSONS LEARNED BECAUSE THEY WERE NOT PART OF THE CODE ROLLOUT OR THE DISCUSSION WAS ALL DONE FROM THE COUNTY LEVEL WITH THE PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT. AND I'M I'M WONDERING IF MAYBE GETTING THAT LIST WOULD BE HELPFUL. TO THE ANALYSIS AS WELL JUST BECAUSE- IN TURN IN TERMS OF TRUSTED ME MESSAGE MESSENGER'S MAYORS ARE GENERALLY WELL LIKED BY THEIR COMMUNITY THAT'S WHY THEY EEP. BECOMING MAYORS AND IT IT MAY MAKE MAKE MAY MAKE SENSE TO HAVE THEIR LIST IN ADDITION SO THAT WORK. WE'RE PUTTING IT TOGETHER WITH THEM WITH WHAT YOU'VE LEARNED. AS WELL. THAT THAT'S KIND OF THE REASON FOR MY QUESTION IS- I BELIEVE AND I MAY BE TOTALLY WRONG THAT SOME OF THE MESSAGING THAT WE DID- THROUGH THE MEDIA DIDN'T GET TO WHERE IT NEEDED TO GO AND SO HOW DO WE DO A BETTER JOB NEXT TIME WE SPEND A LOT OF MONEY ON THE CENSUS AND- AND SOME OF THE UPTAKE WAS PRETTY SLOW- SO. WHAT DID WE LEARN FROM THAT I GUESS IS MY QUESTION. SO I AM THANK YOU I DON'T EXPECT MORE MORE DISCUSSION ON THIS WE HAVE A LOT MORE ITEMS BUT I WANTED I DID WANT TO. BRING UP THE ISSUE- BECAUSE I THINK THAT THERE WERE IMPORTANT I THINK WE NEED TO BE ON. A LITTLE BIT MORE DETAILED IN TERMS OF- HOW WE HOW WE DO IT THINGS DIFFERENTLY. IF WE HAVE A NATURAL DISASTER HOW DO WE COMMUNICATE WITH. WITH THAT THE COMPLEX. RESIDENTS THAT WE HAVE IN THE STATE. LIMAY IF I MAY FOLLOW UP ON ON THAT YOU KNOW ART OR WITNESSES SPOKEN ABOUT WE SHOULD BE MORE EFFICIENT AND THERE SHOULD BE STRUCTURES. WELL WHERE DOES THAT COME FROM WHERE DO WE LEARN WHERE AND HOW WE SHOULD BECOME MORE EFFICIENT AND THAT'S WHY THE SPECIFICITY OF CENTER COPIERS QUESTION IS IMPORTANT. WHAT DID WE LEARN FROM WHAT THE CENSUS WHAT OTHER SOURCES HAVE WE LEARNED FROM. WE'RE NOT GETTING THE ANSWERS TO THAT. AND THEN WE'RE BEING ASKED TO INVEST MORE SUBSTANTIAL RESOURCES. IN THE FUTURE AND A YEAR FROM NOW WILL BE HERE IN THE SAME DIALOGUE. THE SAME ANSWERS THE SAME QUESTIONS THAT WE'RE ASKING HERE TODAY. WE WILL NOT HAVE ANYMORE MEASURABLES ANYMORE EVIDENCE. OF THE NEAT. LET ME FOCUS ON ONE SPECIFIC POINT. AND ASK THIS. ALLEGE ANALYST. THIS TALKS ABOUT THE- NEW LAW OFFICE OF COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIPS AND STRATEGIC COMMUNICATIONS. HOW IS THAT ANY DIFFERENT THIS NEW DEPARTMENT FROM WHAT THEY- AND I APOLOGIZE I DON'T EVEN REMEMBER WHAT THE CURRENT NAME OF IT IS THE OFFICE OF INFORMATION. TECHNOLOGY IS SUPPOSED TO DO. IT WAS ONE CALLED ALL RIGHT IT WAS A ACRONYM AND THEN IT BECAME BILL I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT IT IS NOW BUT- HOW. IS THAT AGENCY THAT DEPARTMENT. WHICH IS A FAIRLY LARGE DEPARTMENT NOW. CAN THEY BE DOING THIS KIND OF. SCRUTINY RESEARCH AND REPORTING ANALYST WHY DO WE HAVE TO START A NEW OFFICE. HI THIS IS BRIAN WHETHER FORD WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE AND- I THINK IT'S A FAIR QUESTION ABOUT WHERE- IF THE LEGISLATURE IS CREATING- SOME SORT OF ENTITY THAT WOULD- ADDRESS THE COMMUNICATIONS- NEEDS THAT. THAT THAT WHERE WHERE THAT'S LOCATED IS I THINK SOMETHING THAT I'M SHOULD BE CONSIDERED. YOU KNOW WITH REGARD TO THE DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY I DON'T KNOW THAT THAT'S MOST APPROPRIATE- PLACE FOR THIS- WE EIGHT. YOU KNOW WE WOULD SUGGEST AS AN ALTERNATIVE PROP THE GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS AGENCY WHICH- HAS EXPERIENCE WITH PUBLIC OUTREACH HAVING OVERSEEN THE TWENTY TWENTY SENSES. ARE RECOVERED AND- ALSO WE NOTE THAT YOU KNOW GO ABOUT SUCH KIND OF A BROAD MISSION THAT'S NOT FOCUSED ON ANY PARTICULAR PUBLIC POLICY AREA AND MAYBE NEED MORE NEUTRAL ABOUT WHICH TOPICS TO FOCUS ON THAN OTHER ALTERNATIVES. BUT I DON'T KNOW DOES THAT ANSWER YOUR YOUR QUESTION CENTER. WELL NO SONG IT'S CLEAR AS MUD BUT IT COVERS THE GROUND. I THINK WE NEED A LITTLE BIT MORE- SO LET'S KEEP THAT DIALOGUE GOING. AND I THINK THAT'S AN IMPORTANT- WE WILL WE WILL BE HAPPY TO GET BACK TO YOU WITH MORE DETAILS BUT THOSE THOSE ARE IMPORTANT QUESTIONS THANK YOU FOR ACKNOWLEDGING THAT. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS ON THIS PARTICULAR ITEM BEFORE WE GO ON TO THE- NEXT ITEM NUMBER EIGHT. CENTER FOR ME WE HAD SOME PREPARED REMARKS ABOUT THE PROPOSAL MORE GENERALLY WE HAVE SOME OTHER ISSUES FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION BESIDES JUST WHERE THE OFFICE WOULD BE LOCATED I WAS ONE IF I BY PRESENTERS NOW. LET'S GO AHEAD. THANK YOU SO WE DO THINK FIFTY GOVERNOR HAS IDENTIFIED A LEGITIMATE NEED WITH THIS PROPOSAL BECAUSE THE STATE. DOES HAVE A NUMBER OF DISPARATE COMMUNICATIONS AND COMMUNITY OUTREACH EFFORTS IN ITS- MISSION TO THE CENSUS WHICH ON. YOU KNOW- CENTER COUPLE YEAR MENTIONED HAD SOME. POSITIVE OUTCOMES AND MAYBE SOME LESSONS TO BE LEARNT THERE'S ALSO FOR EXAMPLE THE CALIFORNIA EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT GOLDEN STATE STIMULUS OUT REACH- THAT'S BEING ADMINISTERED BY THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD IN THE COMMUNITY SERVICES DEPARTMENT. AND INDEPENDENT RESEARCH THAT SHOWED THAT IT- MIGHT HAVE- GRAYSON WARINESS BUT ALSO DIDN'T LEAD TO ANY INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT- CREDITS BEING CLAIMED. SO THERE ARE- POTENTIALLY OPPORTUNITIES THAT COULD BE GAINED BY DESIGNATING A SINGLE ENTITY TO FOCUS ON THE CENTRALISING EXPERTISE MAINTAINING RELATIONSHIPS AND HOPEFULLY CREATE EFFICIENCIES BUT WE'RE NOT SURE THIS PROPOSAL ADDRESSES THIS NEED. AS IT'S STILL CONCEPTUAL DOESN'T PROVIDE THE JUSTIFICATION FOR THE AMOUNT OF REQUESTS ANOTHER IMPORTANT DETAILS. SO WHAT SHOULD YOU AGREE THAT THE CONCEPT HAS MERIT ONE OF THE CONSIDERATIONS WE WANT TO RAISE TO YOU- IS THAT. WE'RE SKEPTICAL THAT ONGOING FUNDING AMOUNT REQUEST WOULD BE NECESSARY RATHER WE WOULD SUGGEST ONLY PROVIDING ADMINISTRATIVE FUNDING ON AN ONGOING BASIS AND THEN ONE TIME FUNDING FOR OTHER SPECIFIC INITIATIVES IS NEEDED. AND THAT WOULD ALLOW THE FUNDING TO- AND THE FOCUS TO ADJUST OVER TIME WITH THE STATE'S NEEDS AND THE LAST ON ISSUE THAT I WANTED TO RAISE- REGARDS THE DESIGNATION OR DETERMINATION OF. WHAT THE STATE'S HIGHEST PRIORITY COMMUNICATIONS ARE IN ANY GIVEN YEAR THE PROPOSAL REPEAL THE SAYS IT WOULD FOCUS ON THOSE BUT WE'RE NOT SURE HOW THAT WOULD BE DETERMINED IN MEETING COULD BE IMPORTANT FOR THE LEGISLATURE HAVE. SOME SAY IN SETTING THOSE PRIORITIES. THANK YOU. THAT IS VERY HELPFUL. AND THAT'S WHAT I WOULD CALL PUTTING SOME MEAT ON THE BONE. AND SOME ACCOUNTABILITY. AND ALLOWING THE LEGISLATURE BETTER INFORMATION TO BASE WHAT WE WOULD DO IN THE FUTURE- SIR HOW WOULD YOU COMMENT ON THE- INQUIRY ABOUT THE DUPLICATION OR THE- ROLE OF THE OFFICE OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY THE CITY THESE ISSUES HERE COULDN'T THOSE BE RESOLVED IN THAT DEPARTMENT- I I'M SORRY I'M NOT. SURE THAT THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY BE THE APPROPRIATE SPACE BECAUSE MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT DEPARTMENT TECHNOLOGIES CONTROL AGENCY FOR OTHER STATE AGENCIES SO IT MAY BE APPROPRIATE AND OVERSEEING A TECHNOLOGY PROJECT RELATED TO MAINTAINING. NETWORKS ARE CONTEXT I'M NOT SURE IT WOULDN'T NECESSARILY BE THE MOST APPROPRIATE LOCATION TO ADMINISTER GRANTS- TO COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS OR DIRECTLY BE INVOLVED IN MARKETING AND OUTREACH EFFORTS. WELL GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF PLANNING RESEARCH PROBABLY BUT GENERALLY COULD PERFORM THAT FUNCTION. BUT I JUST HARPER NO TRUST OR CONFIDENCE WITHOUT SOME KIND OF BENCHMARK SOME MEASURABLE SOME SPECIFIC THINGS THAT HAVE GOT TO BE DELIVERED. AND WE HAVE NOT GOTTEN REALLY DIRECT ANSWERS TO OUR QUESTIONS THEY'VE BEEN SORT OF GENERAL. I BELIEVE THE OBSERVATIONS ABOUT THE LEARNING THE LESSONS OF THE CENSUS OF CRITICALLY IMPORTANT. WHAT HAVE WE LEARNED AND HOW WOULD THAT IT AND THAT'S ONLY ONE PART OF THE OTHER PART IS HOW THAN THAT WOULD APPLY TO WHAT THIS CALL NEW IDEA. WILL BRING TO US. OKAY ANYTHING ELSE ON MY BONUS POINTS FOR. WE DO- WE DO SUGGEST THAT THAT THINKING ABOUT HOW YOU WOULD EVALUATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THESE ACTIVITIES WOULD BE IMPORTANT TO DEVELOP AT THE BE KIDDING LAKE WHILE WE ARE DEVELOPING THIS PROPOSAL WHETHER IT'S THE ADMINISTRATION PREFERABLY WITH THE- INPUT OF THE LEGISLATURE- WE ALSO KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF PRACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS RELATED TO TRANSFERRING CURRENT OUTRAGE RESPONSIBILITIES- THE CALIFORNIA APARTMENT A PUBLIC HEALTH IS CURRENTLY ADMINISTRATING A LOT OF THE- THE VACCINE AND A COVERT RELATED OUT REACH. AND THERE HAVEN'T BEEN ANY DETAILS PROVIDED ABOUT HOW STAFF OR RESOURCES- WOULD BE TRANSFERRED AND THEN GOING FORWARD HOW THIS OFFICE WOULD COORDINATE ITS OUR COMMUNICATIONS- ACTIVITIES WITH- WILL IN THIS CASE THE CALIFORNIA BERMAN A PUBLIC HEALTH AND POSSIBLY DEPENDING ON THE COMMUNICATIONS PARTIES OTHER DEPARTMENTS IN THE FUTURE. THE FOR KERR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WOULD YOU HAVE ANY OBSERVATIONS HERE. YEAH KEVIN CLARK WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. THANK YOU BOB I JUST WANT TO NOTE THAT WE RELEASE DEMONSTRATION RELEASED FOR THE BILL LANGUAGE YESTERDAY THAT CLEARLY ARTICULATES THE GOALS AND OBJECTIVES OF THE DEPARTMENTS ARE THE OPPOSITION'S DAY. AND IN THAT TAPE IN THAT TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE- WE ALSO INCLUDES- INDICATORS FIVE KEY INDICATORS THAT WOULD HELP ASSESS WHAT TYPE OF- OUR MESSAGING CAMPAIGNS WOULD BE- CONSIDERED UNDERNEATH IT THE OFFICE IS ABOUT INCLUDES AYE ALL THAT YOU WENT OUT OF HIS HIGH LEVEL. AND INCLUDES- FOCUSED ON EQUITY FOCUS ON CAMPAIGNS HAVE DATA DRIVEN TO POINT TO THAT AND- CANDIES ARE ACTIONABLE. THEY'RE ALSO GOING TO LOOKING AT RISK SEVERITY AND URGENCY OF THE CAMPAIGN THE NEEDS OF DRESSING. AND ALSO THE IMPACT- AND HOW THE CAMPAIGN MAYBE CROSS DEPARTMENTAL ACROSS AGENCY. WOULD ALSO JUST POINT OUT THAT- PR'S CHARGE IS REALLY DOING MINISTER AND BLACK COMPLEX AND CROSS DEPARTMENTAL COORDINATE EFFORTS. AND SO YOU KNOW THE ADMINISTRATION DOES BELIEVE THAT- COORDINATING STRATEGIC OVERSIGHT OF PUBLIC AWARENESS AND COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT CAMPAIGNS FOR THE ADVOCACY OF THE STATEWIDE CAMPAIGNS. WELL THEN IT'S OBVIOUS DEPARTMENT FINANCES STILL. DOING WORK ON THIS BUT- MY OBSERVE TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WHY DIDN'T YOU BRING THIS INFORMATION FORWARD LITTLE SURE AS WE'VE INQUIRED HERE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN INSTRUCTED. WE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT YOU JUST DONE YESTERDAY. AND WE CERTAINLY DON'T KNOW WHEN YOU'RE GOING TO BRING ANY OF THAT INFORMATION TO US IN THE FUTURE AS WE PROCEED WITH THE UDGET PROCESS WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE VOTING ON SOME OF THIS TODAY. BUT WHAT WE NEED THAT INFORMATION FORTHCOMING YES INDEED THE BUDGET IS A DYNAMIC PROCESS AND CHANGES AS IT GOES. BUT AT LEAST IN MY PART I'M EXPRESSING SOME FRUSTRATION. AT HOW HARD IT IS TO DRAG INFORMATION OUT OF AGENCIES PEARL. IN OUR BUDGET HEARINGS. AND THE UNDERSTAND THE SENATE HAS EMBARKED ON A KIND OF A- DIFFERENT DIRECTION HERE THE LAST FEW YEARS. AND THAT IS ACCEPTING EIGHT OVERSIGHT RESPONSIBILITY. OF THE SENATE. OVERSIGHT AND ONE OF THE BEST PLACES FOR THAT TO OCCUR BE HERE IN THE BUDGET. ANY OTHER COMMENTS FROM ANY OF THE FOLKS ON THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE. AT THE HEART OF IRAQ I. PLEASE SIR YES I JUST READ AGAIN YOU'RE ASKING VERY POINTED QUESTIONS THAT THOSE ARE REALLY ALL OF THEM ARE IMPORTANCE WILL ADD MORE INFORMATION BUT I JUST WANT TO SAY IN ADDITION TO WHAT KEVIN FROM BUREAU OUT OF STATED WE HAVE SENT A DETAILED LIST OF LESSONS LEARNED FROM CORBETT NINETEEN AND OTHER SENSORS IN OUR BCP REPORT. THAT YOU HAVE NOT ENCOURAGE YOU TO TAKE A LOOK AT THAT BUT WE WILL BE HAPPY TO PROVIDE MORE INFORMATION THE IDEA IS BOTH LESSONS LEARNED WILL HELP INFORM THE STRUCTURE THE EFFICIENCY AND THE FOCUS OF THIS NEW PROPOSED OFFICE THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR GIVING US A REFERENCE POINT. AND THAT WILL HELPFUL WE WILL NOT THAT. IN A GOOD STAFF WILL BE LOOKING INTO THAT TOO AND BRING IT TO OUR ATTENTION- WITH. BOTH OF OUR STAFF TO. BE VERY ATTENTIVE TO BE HELPFUL HERE. ARE WE PREPARE THEM TO MOVE ON. ALL RIGHT. TO OUR NEXT THEN SECTION WOULD BE THE PARTNERSHIP AND STRATEGIC COMMUNICATIONS. THE VOLUNTEERS PROPOSAL. THE VOLUNTEERS PROPOSAL. YES SIR SENATOR I WILL INTRODUCE OUR CHIEF SERVICES OFFICER JOSH FRIDAY FROM LOKI ARCS WALK YOU THROUGH THE PROPOSAL- FOR THE CALIFORNIA CLIMATE CORPS STATE SERVICES PROGRAM THE NEXT ITEM JOSH. THANK YOU. THANK YOU DIRECTOR- THANK YOU SENATORS YOUR TIME SEE YOU ALL MY NAME IS JOSH FRIDAY AND HE SERVICE OFFICERS AND- IN OVERSEA CALIFORNIA VOLUNTEERS THIS YEAR WE HAVE THREE BUDGET PROPOSALS FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION ONE IS THE CALIFORNIA CLIMATE ACTION COURT TO THE NEIGHBOR TO NEIGHBOR PROGRAM AND THREE FOSTER GRANDPARENTS AND SENIOR COMPANIONS PROGRAM. THE CALIFORNIA CLIMATE ACTION CORPS BUDGET PROPOSAL SEEKS TO MAKE ON GOING THE LIMITED TERM INVESTMENT OF THREE POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS IN A PROGRAMMATIC CLIMATE PROGRAMS FOR A TOTAL ONGOING REQUEST OF FOUR POINT SEVEN MILLION THE INITIAL APPROPRIATION RECEIVED IN THE TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO BUDGET PROVIDED ONGOING STAFF BUT ONLY THREE YEARS OF FUNDING FOR PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION AND WE ARE NOW REQUESTING THIS PROGRAMMATIC FUNDING BE ON GOING TO ENSURE THE SUSTAINABILITY OF THE PROGRAM. THIS PROGRAM AS YOU MAY KNOW LEVERAGES FEDERAL AMERICORPS FUNDING- AND WHILE THIS PROGRAM IS STILL IN ITS EARLY STAGES THE INTEREST HAS BEEN SUBSTANTIAL WE HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE INTEREST IN POSITIONS. THAT WERE ABLE TO FILL AND WE'VE ALSO. THE PROGRAM IT'S RECENTLY BEEN WRITTEN ABOUT AS A MODEL FOR A POTENTIAL NATIONAL CRIME RECORDS. IN THE ADMINISTRATION BELIEVES THIS PROGRAM WILL BE CRITICAL TO MEETING ALL OF OUR STATES CLIMATE GOAS. WE ARE CURRENTLY WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEE TO PROVIDE MORE INFORMATION ON THE SUCCESS OF THE PROGRAM TO DATE AS HAS BEEN REQUESTED- AND I LOOK FORWARD VERY MUCH TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH YOU ALL. ON THIS SPECIFIC ITEM. FOR THE NEIGHBOR TO NEIGHBOR BUDGET PROPOSAL AND THE FOSTER GRANDPARENTS AND SENIOR COMPANIONS BUDGET PROPOSALS THEY BUILD ON THE SUCCESS THAT WE HAVE HAD DURING THE PANDEMIC TO ACTIVATE CALIFORNIANS TO SERVING TO TACKLE SOME OF OUR GREATEST CHALLENGES. AND DURING THE DAY DANCE DURING THIS PANDEMIC CALIFORNIA VOLUNTEERS LAUNCHED THE NEIGHBOR TO NEIGHBOR PROGRAM. WHICH PREVIOUSLY LETTER WHICH LEVERAGED PREVIOUSLY APPROVED DISASTER FUNDING AND NOW WE'RE REQUESTING TEN MILLION DOLLARS IN ONGOING FUNDING TO MAINTAIN THIS PROGRAM. AND ALSO TO BUILD IT OUT THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE STATE. FOR FUTURE DISASTERS AND TO MEET OTHER STATE PRIORITIES THE NEIGHBOR TO NEIGHBOR PROGRAM BECAUSE OUR NEIGHBORS TO BE THE FIRST IN A LINE OF SUPPORT FOR CALIFORNIA'S MOST VULNERABLE RESIDENTS TO CONNECT NEIGHBORS. TO TAKE ACTION AND TO SUPPORT EACH OTHER. AFTER THE PROGRAM LAUNCHED MY OFFICE MET A COUPLE FROM INDIO- WHICH I LOVED IT DID QUICKLY TELL YOU ABOUT THE BECAUSE THEY LEFT A LASTING IMPRESSION ON ALL OF US AND I THINK ALSO DEMONSTRATES. ONE WAY THAT THIS PROGRAM IS GONNA HAVE AN IMPORTANT IMPACT FOR OUR STATE. WE MET JEAN WHO IS EIGHTY FIVE YEARS OLD AT THE TIME AND THEN WITH A NINETY TWO YEAR OLD WORLD WAR TWO THE NAVY VETERANS- AND I HAPPEN TO HAVE A SPECIAL AFFINITY TO NAVY VETERANS. WITH THE CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE- AND HE HAD BEEN IN SELF QUARANTINE FOR WEEKS AND STARTING TO RUN OUT OF SUPPLIES AND FOOD- AND BECAUSE OF THE TIMING OF IT THEY WERE NOT ABLE TO FIND A LOCAL STORE TO DELIVER TO THEIR HOME. AND SO JEAN REACHED OUT THROUGH THE NEIGHBOR TO NEIGHBOR PROGRAM THAT WE HAD LAUNCHED TO CALIFORNIA VOLUNTEERS IN BECAUSE OF THIS PROGRAM. WE WERE ABLE TO ALTERNATELY ARRANGED THE DELIVERY OF MILK. AEGS TOILET PAPER AND GOODS THAT WERE. NOT TO THE COUPLE. SO THROUGH THIS pPANDEMIC AS WELL AS OTHER DISASTERS WE HAVE LEARNED THE CRITICAL NATURE OF EMPOWERING NEIGHBORS TO HELP EACH OTHER. AND WE ARE VERY EXCITED TO BUILD THIS OUT ACROSS THE STATE IN THE COMING YEARS. THE FOSTER GRANDPARENTS AND SENIOR COMPANIONS BUDGET PROPOSAL IS A ONE TIME IF I LIVE TO EXPAND THESE ALREADY EXISTING AMERICORPS PROGRAMS. AND AS YOU MAY ALL KNOW THE CALIFORNIA VOLUNTEERS OPERATES THE LARGEST AMERICORPS PORTFOLIO IN THE COUNTRY. THIS PARTICULAR PROPOSAL WOULD ESTABLISH A PASSED THROUGH A TEN MILLION DOLLARS IN FUNDING TO ORGANIZATIONS THAT COMPETITIVELY APPLY FOR IN OUR WARD GRANT'S ASSOCIATED. WITH THESE TWO PROGRAMS. AND WHILE THE TYPICAL DEMOGRAPHICS THE CALIFORNIA VOLUNTEERS ARE AMERICORPS MEMBERS. ARE GENERALLY INDIVIDUALS AGES EIGHTEEN TO THIRTY THIS INVESTMENT BUILDS ON CALIFORNIA VOLUNTEERS LEADERSHIP AND SERVICE AND COMPREHENSIVE EXPAND SERVICE OPPORTUNITIES FOR OLDER CALIFORNIANS. I'M ALSO- JOINED TODAY BY MY COLLEAGUE IN THE CHAVEZ AND WE LOOK FOR TO ANSWERING ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE ON THESE PROPOSALS THANK YOU. IF YOU'RE CALLING COMMENT HERE AT THIS POINT- JUST BE AVAILABLE FOR QUESTIONS I THINK MOSTLY AVAILABLE FOR QUESTIONS BUT A LOT OF JUNK AND IF NEED BE. OKAY MANY OF OUR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. ON A REQUIRE THIS. ISSUE LONG TO. ALL RIGHT- pWE WE'VE HAD A LOT OF SUCCESSION MANY PROGRAMS WITH THE VOLUNTEERS FOR SURE. AND I THINK YOU LATER AT LEAST A- REASONABLE ARGUMENT- HOW THIS COULD. BE JUSTIFIED IN EXPANDING. BUT LET ME ASK YOU THIS QUESTION WERE WE TO PROCEED WITH THIS. BUDGET PROPOSAL. WHAT WOULD YOU BE BRINGING FORWARD TO THE COMMITTEE NEXT YEAR. TO ASCERTAIN THE PROGRESS AND SUCCESS OF NOT JUST IN GENERAL THE VERY SPECIFIC. WHAT WOULD BE THE BENCHMARKS OF SUCCESS THAT WE COULD MEASURE NEXT YEAR TO SEE IF THIS MONEY WAS WELL SPENT FOR THAT QUESTION- ALSO ALLOW MY COLLEAGUES ANTHONY TRAVIS IT TO JUMP IN- TO HELP ANSWER BUT I THINK- WE ARE VERY- WE THINK IT'S- VERY IMPORTANT- TO HAVE SPECIFIC METRICS AND OUTCOMES ABOUT WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH ABOUT WHAT. OUR VOLUNTEERS ARE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH ABOUT THE IMPACT THAT THEY'RE HAVING- AND WE HOPE WITH YOUR SUPPORT THAT WE'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO COME BACK AND HAVE VERY SPECIFIC NUMBERS OF HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE WE ENGAGING THE SERVICE PROGRAMS HOW MANY OLDER CALIFORNIANS. HAVE PARTICIPATED BECAUSE OF THIS PROGRAM IN BEING ABLE TO SERVE THEIR COMMUNITIES AND FEEL CONNECTED TO THEIR COMMUNITIES HOW MANY YOUNG PEOPLE FROM DISADVANTAGED BACKGROUNDS ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO HAVE A STATEMENT AND A SCHOLARSHIP FOR COLLEGE. AND AN OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE A REAL CAREER PATH BECAUSE WE'VE INVESTED IN THE SERVICE AND VOLUNTEER OPPORTUNITIES HOW MANY NEIGHBORS VERY SPECIFICALLY DID WE ENGAGED IN RETRAIN DID WE EMPOWER AS LEADERS IN THEIR COMMUNITY TO BE ABLE TO RESPOND AND BE RESILIENT. IN A DISASTER SITUATION THOSE ARE THE KINDS OF NUMBERS- AND SPECIFIC DATA THAT WE. FULLY EXPECT AND HOPE TO BRING BACK TO YOU NEXT YEAR. VERY SAYS SECTOR. SIR THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATOR NOW LET ME ASK THIS QUESTION. HOW WOOD WE LEGISLATORS WHO REPRESENT DIVERSE AREAS AND I MEAN DIVERSE AS IN RURAL URBAN AND SUBURBAN. COMMUNITIES HOW CAN WE BE ASSURED THAT THESE. AVENUES WILL BE AVAILABLE TO THEM. TAKE FROM MODOC COUNTY TO FRESNO COUNTY TO SANTA BARBARA COUNTY HOW WILL THAT BE AVAILABLE AVAIL THEM TO MOTIVATE AND SUPPORT THEIR. I THINK I AM ONE IS TO KNOW THAT THESE PROGRAMS ARE STATEWIDE AND OUR FOCUS WILL BE STATEWIDE BUT I THINK IT TURNS CAN COME FROM THE FACT THAT WE ARE OFFICE SINCE I'VE BEEN IN THIS ROLE HAS PRIORITIZE INVESTING IN THE COMMUNITIES YOU JUST MENTIONED ON MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE REACHING OUT A BROAD. SWATH OF CALIFORNIA SO FOR EXAMPLE- THE LEGISLATURE INVESTED AN ADDITIONAL TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS A COUPLE YEARS AGO- IT TO INCREASE AMERICORPS POSITIONS- WITHIN MY OFFICE- FOR US TO CREATE MORE POSITIONS FOR YOUNG PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO START. BECAUSE OF THAT INVESTMENT WE WERE ABLE TO CREATE A BRAND NEW INNOVATIVE PROGRAM IN BUTTE COUNTY TO SUPPORT THE RECOVERY OF THE- OF THE COMMUNITY FROM THE PARADISE FIRE IT'S A SPECIFIC EXAMPLE OF HOW WE ARE ABLE TO USE SERVICE POSITIONS- TO BRING RESOURCES TO THAT COMMUNITY. IN ORDER TO HELP THEM THE EXAMPLE I GAVE OF THE NEIGHBOR TO NEIGHBOR PROGRAM WITHIN IN GENE COMES FROM INDIO CALIFORNIA WHERE THEY LIVED IN A RURAL AREA- WHERE THEY DIDN'T- THEY DIDN'T HAVE ACCESS TO A TO US CLOSE SUPERMARKETS ARE CLOSE BY- AND OTHER RESOURCES THAT WERE CLOSE BY BECAUSE OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WE INVEST IN THE PROGRAM THAT WE CREATED. WE WERE ABLE TO SUPPORT THOSE COMMUNITIES AND WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO INVEST IN THOSE COMMUNITIES- IN A VERY REAL WAY. WELL YOU'RE SPEAKING THE HEART THERE RELATED TO WHAT YOU HAD DONE UP FOR PARADISE AND YOU KNOW I'M NOT. OF THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THAT ASSISTANCE THAT COMMUNITY AS AN IS REBUILT TREMENDOUS SUCCESS. OF THAT REBUILD. I'VE ALWAYS SAID AND I GIVE YOU THEN SOME CREDIT TO. FOR THIS SUCCESS THE STORY OF THE- A NICE FIRE WILL NOT BE. THE FIRE. OR EVEN THE DEATH. THE LETTERS ALL TRAGIC BUT THE REAL STORY IS HOW THE COMMUNITY CAME BACK. AND THAT'S WHERE YOU FIT INTO THE PICTURE. ANY OF THE MEMBERS HAVE ADDITIONAL INQUIRIES REGARDING THE VOLUNTEER PROPOSALS. AND THEN WE WOULD GO ON TO THE TRIBAL AFFAIRS OFFICE ISSUE NUMBER. NINE THANK YOU VICE CHAIR- ISSUE NUMBER NINE- THE TRIBAL AFFAIRS OFFICE THE NATIVE AMERICAN HERITAGE COMMISSION I REQUEST THAT THE NET ZERO TRANSFER OF HUNDRED FIFTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS ENVIRONMENTAL LICENSE PLATE FUND ONGOING.

AS LEGISLATIVE STAFF THE DISUNITY ENGAGES WITH LEGS THAT HAVE OFFICES TO SUPPORT THE ADMINISTRATION'S BUDGET PRIORITIES THE LEGISLATIVE TEAM HAVE ASKED WITH AN INCREASING NUMBER OF DUTIES ON A VARIETY OF HIGH PRIORITIES OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS AND WITH NEW BUDGETS AND WHILE THE LEGISLATURE AND ADMINSTRATION'S EXPANSION OF PROGRAMS OUT OPR HAS BEEN SWIFT THE STOPPING FOR THE LEGISLATIVE WORK HAS NOT BE KEPT UP PACE TO FULLY SUPPORT APPEARANCE VARIOUS BUDGETARY OBLIGATIONS AND BUDGET PROGRAMS OVER THE PAST.

IF YOU ACTUALLY DID THE INCORPORATION OF THE NUMBER OF LEGISLATIVE. INQUIRIES AND RESPONSES. IS THAT WHERE YOU GET IN GAME THAT THE OBSERVATION THAT RESPONSE THAT DATA. SENATOR THAT IS CORRECT- WE REQUESTED BACK UP FOR ON THE PROPOSAL AND THEY PROVIDED. DETAILED INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR NUMBER OF BILLS THAT THEY ARE ANALYZING THAT THE OFFICES IN THE PAST ANALYZE EVERY YEAR AND- THEIR WORKLOAD HAS OF THE OFFICE OVERALL- THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES HAVE. BEEN INCREASED OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS. AND SO IT'S REASONABLE TO EXPECT THAT FROM A NUMBER OF THEIR ADMINISTRATIVE AND MANAGEMENT- RESPONSIBILITIES ARE INCREASING THE POTENTIAL. THANK YOU SENATOR ROB SENATOR CABALLERO. I'M I DON'T HAVE ANY QUESTIONS FOR THIS I GUESS THE COMMENT IS YOU KNOW THE MORE. TASKS WE COME UP WITH- FROM THE LEGISLATURE OR FROM THE ADMINISTRATION I GUESS THERE WOULD BE- YOU KNOW I NEED TO HAVE MORE STAFFING POSITIONS BUT I THINK IT ALWAYS GOES BACK TO. HAVING THE RIGHT PEOPLE IN THE RIGHT SEATS DOING THE RIGHT WORK- TO MAKE SURE THAT CALIFORNIANS GET WHAT THEY NEED- SO I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY WE'RE GOING TO HOLD THIS ONE OPEN. I SEE NO OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS WE'RE GOING TO MOVE TO ISSUE NUMBER ELEVEN- THE UPDATE ON GOBIZ SMALL BUSINESS RELIEF PROGRAM. SO ARE WE READY ARE YOU READY SAM. OKAY I BELIEVE WE HAVE SOMEONE WE HAVE SOMEONE ELSE I'M SORRY YES AFTERNOON CHAIR COM LONGER THAT.

I CAN CERTAINLY ATTEST IN MY CASE IT'S BECAUSE OF THE FIRES. BUT IT IT ND'S LEADERS ARE VERY SIGNIFICANT IN SMALL COMMUNITIES AND THAT'S OF LOBBYIST REASONS WHY.

TIME NEW DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND ON OUR JOHNSON DEPARTMENT FINANCE- I BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE- MISTER RYAN BACKER FROM DE UM. AND THERE'S A CALIFORNIA THAT IS ABLE TO- PRESENT THIS- IS PROPOSAL. PLEASE RYAN GO AHEAD. THANK YOU SENATOR THE- THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET- PROPOSED FORTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR- CONTINUED TOURISM MARKETING FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- ADMINISTERED BY VISIT CALIFORNIA NO WE ARE CURRENTLY OPERATING- OF ABOUT 33% DECLINE IN OVERALL- COLLECTIONS ARE TYPICALLY PRIVATELY FUNDED BY BUSINESSES IN THE STATE OF THOSE BUSINESSES THAT REVENUE HAD HAS BEEN IMPACTED- BY VIA DOWNTURN IN TOURISM DUE TO THE IN THE MAKE IN THE TOURISM MARKETING OF HIS CALIFORNIA IS DOING. IS GETTING THE RECOVERY AS ENDEMIC RESTRICTIONS ARE BEING LISTED- ANY QUESTIONS. MEMBERS ANY QUESTIONS. NINE BILLION YEAH THE JOURNALIST. BRING WHETHER FORD WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE AS NOTED IN THE AGENDA WE FIND THAT THERE'S A CALIFORNIA'S EXISTING RESOURCES SUPPLEMENTED BY THE STATE'S NINETY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR CONTRIBUTION IN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET SHOULD SUPPORT ADVERTISING SPENDING SOMEWHAT ABOVE PRE PANDEMIC LEVELS WITHOUT ADDITIONAL STATE FUNDS BUT WE DON'T DISPUTE THAT THE CALIFORNIA ASSESSMENT OF THE IMPACT OF COVETED ON THE TOURISM INDUSTRY OR ITS DECLINE IN REVENUES AND WE COMMEND IT'S A CALIFORNIA FOR PRUDENTLY REDUCING SPENDING ON ADVERTISING AT THE ONSET OF THE PANDEMIC. AND WE NOTE THAT- THAT THE AMOUNT THAT IT HAS SHOULD BE SUFFICIENT RESOURCES TO RESTORE SPENDING WHILE IT'S ASSESSMENT REVENUES RECOVER TO THE EXTENT THAT ADDITIONAL STATE FUNDING WOULD ALLOW THE ORGANIZATION TO SPEND SIGNIFICANTLY MORE ON ADVERTISING THAN IT DID BEFORE THE PANDEMIC WE JUST HAVE TO BE INCREMENTAL BENEFIT OF THIS ADDITIONAL- ADVERTISING IS UNCLEAR. THANK YOU FOR THAT NOW WE'D LIKE TO OPEN IT UP FOR DISCUSSION WITH THE COMMITTEE. VICE CHAIR NIELSEN. SENATOR CABALLERO. SENATOR ROCK. THANK YOU SO MUCH WE WILL NOW MOVE TO ISSUE. NUMBER THIRTEEN IMMIGRATION INTEGRATION AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. IS IT STILL MISS GRAY. WITH SENATOR HELLO THIS IS EMILY DECIDE FROM A DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR THE INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS AND TRADE TEAM AND I WOULD BE I'M GLAD TO TALK ABOUT THIS PARTICULAR PROPOSAL. WILL HIT. THANK YOU SENATOR- GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS EMILY DECIDED DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS AND TRADE TEAM AT GO BIDS. GENERATIONS OF IMMIGRANTS FROM ACROSS THE GLOBE HAVE CHANGED SHAPE TO CALIFORNIA'S HISTORY AND PROGRESS. TODAY IMMIGRANTS COMPRISE 27% OF THE POPULATION WELL HALF OF ALL CHILDREN IN CALIFORNIA HAVE AT LEAST ONE IMMIGRANT PARENTS. IT'S WHETHER THEY ARRIVE TO SEEK SAFETY OR OPPORTUNITY HAVE BEEN INTEGRAL TO CALIFORNIA'S IDENTITY AND ECONOMIC GROWTH FOR MANY GENERATIONS. AND CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN A NATIONAL LEADER IN DEVELOPING POLICIES AND PROGRAMS AIM TO SUPPORT OUR STATE'S DIVERSE IMMIGRANT COMMUNITY PARTICULARLY TO ADDRESS DISPARITIES IN ACCESS TO HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES. AND TO ENHANCE CRITICAL LABOR AND WORKFORCE PROTECTIONS. EXPANDING THIS EXPERTISE WITHIN WITHIN THE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND INTERNATIONAL PORTFOLIO AND GO THIS IS THE NEXT CHAPTER TO CALIFORNIA'S PROGRESS TO ADVANCE IMMIGRANT INTEGRATION AND EQUITY. WITH THAT IN MIND WE ARE REQUESTING ELEVEN POINT SIX MILLION ONE TIME GENERAL FUND IN TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE AND FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND ANNUALLY THEREAFTER FOR THIS PROPOSAL WHICH SERVES TWO PRIMARY FUNCTIONS. FIRST IT AIMS TO ADDRESS THE GAP IN RESOURCES TO SUPPORT STATEWIDE CONVENING IN COORDINATION FOR THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE THAT IS POPULATION FOCUSED ACROSS THE PORTFOLIOS OF OUR STATE AGENCY PARTNERS. ASIAN EVENTS RECENT HAVE HIGHLIGHTED THE BENEFITS AND IMPORTANCE OF COORDINATION ACROSS STATE GOVERNMENT TO SUPPORT EFFECTIVE RESPONSES. THE INTERNATIONAL FAIRS AND TRADE TEAM ALREADY PLAYS A UNIQUE ROLE AS A CONVENER INCLUDING ON ISSUES RELATED TO THE CALIFORNIA MEXICO BORDER AND OTHER INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS. AND IS WELL POSITIONED TO SUPPORT STATEWIDE IN INTEGRATION COORDINATION AN IMMIGRANT EXPERTISE ACROSS GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS AND SERVICES. SECOND THIS PROPOSAL BUILDS ON THE STATE INVESTMENT IN ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY THROUGH ENTREPRENEURSHIP. IT DOES THIS THROUGH ONE TIME FUNDING FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO HELP CITIES AND COUNTY SEAT AND THE PLAY BEST PRACTICES IN PROGRAMS AND SERVICES. FOR IMMIGRANT ENTREPRENEURS AND BUSINESS OWNERS CREATING ACCESSIBLE IN TAYLOR BUSINESS START GUIDES IN MULTIPLE LANGUAGES AND SUPPORTS BUSINESS GROWTH AND RESILIENCY THROUGH EXPORT TRAINING AND CROSS BORDER ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. THANK YOU AND I'M HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU- DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE DEPARTMENT FINANCE NOTHING TO ADD. THANK YOU- L. A. L. YES BRIAN WHETHER FORD WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE BUT WE JUST WANT TO NOTE THAT THE STATE SUPPORTS MANY EXISTING PROGRAMS AND ORGANIZATIONS TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE MENTORING OPPORTUNITIES AND FINANCIAL SUPPORT TO UNDERSERVED BUSINESSES AND ENTREPRENEURS. FROM MANY UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES INCLUDING IMMIGRANTS HOW THIS PROPOSAL WOULD HELP ADDRESS CHALLENGES SPECIFICALLY FACED BY IMMIGRANT BUSINESSES- THAT ARE NOT ADDRESSED BY THESE EXISTING PROGRAMS IS UNCLEAR- THAT'S IT SOME SOME COMPONENTS THIS PACKAGE SUCH AS TRANSLATING ASSISTANCE FOR ENTREPRENEURS INTO LANGUAGES OTHER THAN ENGLISH COULD HAVE MERIT. MANY OF THE STATE'S RESIDENTS HAVE A GREATER FLUENCY IN A LANGUAGE OTHER THAN ENGLISH AND- TRANSLATING STATE RESOURCES INTO LANGUAGES OTHER THAN ENGLISH WOULD HAVE MERIT- AND THAT EXTENDS TO- MANY MANY MANY MANY RESIDENTS NOT JUST DEMOCRATS AND THE LEGISLATURE ALSO COULD CONSIDER WHETHER THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS THE SECRETARY OF STATE AND OTHER STATE AGENCIES THAT PROVIDE SERVICES TO BUSINESSES. SHOULD MAKE MORE OF THEIR FORMS AN INFORMATIONAL MATERIALS AVAILABLE MAKE WHICH IS OTHER THAN ENGLISH- WE HAVE A POST THAT WAS JUST PUBLISHED ON OUR WEBSITE- I'M SORRY. REGARDING GO BIZ WE HAVE A PERSONALLY PUBLISHED ON A WEBSITE LATER THIS WEEK THAT EXPANDS ON SOME OF OUR SPECIFIC CONCERNS REGARDING THE EIGHT POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLAR GRANT PROGRAM. SO I WENT UP INTO THOSE NOW UNLESS YOU HAVE QUESTIONS. OKAY THANK YOU MR VICE CHAIR. THE IRAQ. ANNA CABALLERO. I YOU KNOW I ACTUALLY HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT THIS. I YOU KNOW I CALL ME CRAZY BUT I THINK THAT- FOLKS THAT ARE TRYING TO START A BUSINESSES FROM OUR IMMIGRANT POPULATION PROBABLY NEED MORE THAN JUST START UP GUIDES- AND SO I AM HOPING THAT THERE CAN BE MORE DETAIL AROUND THAT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I- THAT ACTUALLY STRUCK ME OVER THE WEEKEND WHEN I WAS HOME IN MY DISTRICT I WAS IN. DOWNTOWN LA AT AN EVENT THERE WERE- LOTS OF PEOPLE- LOTS OF SMALL BUSINESSES RIGHT VENDORS- OUT ON THE STREET- SELLING THEIR WARES IN PRODUCTS AND I ENDED UP HAVING A DISCUSSION. WITH SOMEONE- WITH A CONSTITUENT ABOUT- SPECIFICALLY- LATINO ENTREPRENEURS- WHO HAVE SMALL MOM AND POP START UPS- AND HAVE TO WHETHER CARTELS- AND HOW IT REALLY PLAYS A ROLE IN HOW MUCH THEY'RE ABLE TO SELL WHAT THEY HAVE TO SELL I MEAN HOW THEY'RE ABLE TO SURVIVE. AND SO YOU KNOW I WOULD HOPE AND I DOES HAVE TO BE SPECIFIC TO THIS BUT THERE CAN BE SOME REAL DISCUSSIONS ABOUT HOW WE CAN PROTECT- AND SUPPORT- MEMBERS OF OUR IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIESTHAT ARE INTERESTED IN HAVING BUSINESSES AND STARTING THEM THAT ARE TRYING TO DO IT WITH SUPPORTS THAT PREVENT THEM FROM HAVING TO DEAL WITH- PREDATORY- ENTITIES- THAT ARE REALLY ARE OUT TO HARM THEM. I WAS TRYING TO BE VERY NICE TO SAY THAT CARTELS PREY ON LOTS OF IMMIGRANT POPULATIONS- AND SO HOPEFULLY THERE CAN BE SOME DISCUSSION ABOUT HOW WE CAN USE THESE KINDS OF SUPPORT SOME FUNDING TO HELP THEM AT PROTECT GET FEEL PROTECTED OR HAVE SOME PROTECTION FROM THOSE GROUPS- I KNOW YOU LIKE HANA. SENATOR I WOULD BE HAPPY TO RESPOND- SO I THINK PART OF WHAT YOU'RE DESCRIBING COULD COULD CERTAINLY COME INTO PLAY WITH THE- ONE TIME LOCAL GRANTS THAT WE HOPE TO DEPLOY- IN SPEAKING WITH MY COLLEAGUES THAT THAT- DSS WHO- TO PLAY GRANTS TO LOCAL COMMUNITIES AND JURISDICTIONS FOR LEGAL AID AND SERVICES FOR IMMIGRANTS- I THINK THIS COULD BE A GOOD OPPORTUNITY FOR- THE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS THAT WE HOPE TO DEPLOY FUNDING TO CRAFT PROGRAMS THAT MIGHT DO EXACTLY THAT. AND COORDINATE WITH LEGAL SERVICES- WHERE THERE ARE EXISTING PROGRAMS TO SUPPORT ON ON THE LEGAL SIDE SO COORDINATED EFFORTS AND PROVIDING FUNDING FOR LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO CRAFT PROGRAMS THAT ARE ARE GOOD PROVIDE SPECIFICS SUPPORT TO THEIR ENTREPRENEURS IS ONE AREA WHERE WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO ADDRESS- THAT THE PROBLEM THAT YOU'RE SPEAKING TO. THANK YOU YES THE STREET VENDORS MOSTLY. I'M SO. I'M GONNA MOVE ON TO ISSUE FOURTEEN COMBATING ORGANIZED RETAIL THEFT. LIKE TO HEAR FROM GOBIZ IS IT STILL EMILY. NO THERE'S NO MATTER NO MADAM CHAIR CAROLYN GRAY DIRECTOR ON CALLAWAY C. EIGHTY NINE- SO AS PART OF A LARGER PROPOSAL TARGETING RETAIL FAST WE ARE REQUESTING TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR A GRANT PROGRAM FOR SMALL BUSINESSES. WE HAVE BEEN WORKING CLOSELY WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT AND RETAIL INDUSTRY EXPERTS TO DEVELOP THIS PROGRAM WE ANTICIPATE THAT THE PROGRAM WOULD SIMPLY COMPENSATE SMALL BUSINESSES FOR PROPERTY LOSSES AS A RESULT CRIME AND WE ARE ON THAT DEFINING THOSE SMALL BUSINESSES AS- BUSINESSES WITH FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN REVENUE OR LAST. AND WE HAVE DRAFT LANGUAGE COMPLETED AND BELIEVE WE ARE REALLY CLOSE TO HAVING SOMETHING PUBLISHED. A THANK YOU'S THAT'S MILLION OR NET. I REQUEST OKAY- BLAME RESIDENTS OKAY GREAT- DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. MARK JOHNSON DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND NO COMMENT AT THIS TIME THANK YOU THANK YOU ALEJO. BRIAN WHETHER FORD WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE- THIS ITEM IS PART OF A LARGER PUBLIC SAFETY PACKAGE IN OUR ANALYSIS THE GOVERNOR SPOKE PROPOSAL FOR ADDRESSING ORGANIZED RETAIL THEFT INCLUDING A MORE IN DEPTH ANALYSIS OF THE SITE AND IN THE CONTEXT OF THE OTHER ASSOCIATED PROPOSALS WILL BE PUBLISHED IN A SEPARATE BRIEF THAT'S FORTHCOMING HOPEFULLY FAIRLY SOON. IT WITH REGARDS TO THE SPECIFIC- ITEM THE GENDER HIGHLIGHTS AND THE CONSIDERATIONS THAT WE'VE RAISED ABOUT- TO SOME OF THE PRACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS WITH IMPLEMENTING A PROGRAM LIKE THIS. I'M STEPPING BACK A LITTLE BIT I THINK THE MOST IMPORTANT POINT THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO MAKE AS IT RELATES TO THIS PROPOSAL IS pINDIVIDUAL COMPONENTS OF THE ORGANIZED RETAIL THEFT PACKAGE SUCH AS THIS ONE ON YOU SHOULD CONSIDER WHETHER THE GOAL OF THIS PROPOSAL IN THIS CASE TO PROVIDE COMPENSATION FOR SOME VICTIMS OF. OF RETAIL THEFT- THE WAY IT'S WRITTEN IN BUDGET BUILDING WHICH ON IS WHETHER THAT'S CONSISTENT WITH YOUR BROADER PUBLIC SAFETY GOALS. AND THEN DEPENDING ON YOUR PRIORITIES THERE MIGHT BE MORE EFFECTIVE ALTERNATIVES TO THIS PROPOSAL. IN OUR FORTHCOMING BRIEF WE WILL PROVIDE A FRAMEWORK TO HELP THE LEGISLATURE THINK THREE SCHOOLS AND PROBABLY PROVIDE VARIOUS ALTERNATIVES THAT EXPAND ON EXISTING PROGRAMS. AND THAT ARE BASED ON RESEARCH. THANK YOU SO MUCH. I'M GONNA BRING IT BACK TO MISTER VICE CHAIR. THANK YOU MANAGER. YOU KNOW THIS ISSUE IS OF ENORMOUS MAGNITUDE. IT'S PROBABLY BEEN MOST VISUAL BY THE INVASIONS OF LARGE BUSINESS. BY GANGS AND OTHERS WHO HAD SOUGHT TO PROFIT. BUT IT IS PARTICULARLY DEVASTATING. FOR A SMALL BUSINESS WHO ALSO I'VE SUFFERED. WE LOOK FORWARD TO ANALYSTS FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF THE IDEA AND TAKEN IN CONTEXT OF AN OVERALL MEANS OF ADDRESSING THIS PROBLEM. SIMPLY RECOMPENSE AND BUSINESSES SMALL OR EVEN LARGE FOR THE LOSSES IS NOT AN ANSWER. FOR A SMALL BUSINESS IT MIGHT KEEP THEM ALIVE AND WELL FOR OF TIME. BUT THE BIGGER ISSUE STATUTORILY MUST BE ADDRESSED AND DEALT WITH. AND IN TERMS OF THE JUSTICE SYSTEM. IN TERMS OF SENTENCING IN TERMS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT RESOURCES. THIS IS A HUGE ISSUE. AND IT IS A PRODUCT. MARJORIE A VOTE OF THE PEOPLE. AND BOTH OF THE LEGISLATURE. SO AS WE THE LEGISLATURE ADDRESS THIS ISSUE WE'VE GOT TO TAKE OF THE COMPREHENSIVE MULTI FACETED APPROACH. THE STOPPING. THIS GREAT TRAVESTY THAT IS INFESTED OUR COUNTRY THANK YOU MANAGER THANK YOU MR VICE CHAIR SENATOR CAFIERO. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- I WANT TO A DEGREE- WITH SENATOR NIELSEN I THINK THE- I'M I WANT TO LOOK AT THE REPORT THANK YOU TO THE L. A. O. FOR FOR DOING THAT REPORT- I THINK WE'RE ALL AWARE OF THE ISSUE- I'D HAVE LAUGHED THE LARGER EFFECTIVE RETAIL. BECAUSE OF THE SMASH AND GRAB- ISSUES THAT ARE OF HAVE POPPED UP. GET REALLY GIVE US THE VISUAL OF HOW AWFUL AND HOW DANGEROUS- THESE- THESE ORGANIZED EFFORTS AT AT STEALING OUR BUT I HAVE TO AGREE THAT I'M NOT SURE WHO THAT COMPENSATING FOR LOSSES IS THE SOLUTION I THINK WE NEED TO LOOK AT. HOW WE CAN HELP BOB LOCAL COMMUNITIES TO SET UP THE SECURITY THEY NEED AROUND THEIR RETAIL AREAS- AND- AND LOOK AT IT THAT LOOK. LOOK TO SEE IF THERE'S A WAY FOR US TO BE ABLE TO BE PARTNERS WITH. WITH OUR- OUR BUSINESS COMMUNITY AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO SET UP SECURITY SYSTEM SO. I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO THE REPORT I'M NOT SURE THIS IS THE ANSWER BUT- I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT. THE DISCUSSION IS STARTING HERE NO QUESTION WE HAVE A PROBLEM WE CAN SOLVE. THANK YOU SENATOR SENATOR ROCK- I YOU KNOW- I ACTUALLY THINK IT'S- YOU KNOW ADMIRABLE BUT HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT YOU KNOW HOW THE FUNDS WOULD GET DISTRIBUTED AND ALSO HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT THEWILLINGNESS OF SMALL BUSINESSES TO EVEN TRY TO APPLY FOR THIS KIND OF COMPENSATION BECAUSE YOU KNOW- IT'S ONE THING AND I DON'T WANT TO LIKE YOU KNOW USE CERTAIN BUSINESSES AS EXAMPLES BUT LARGER COMPANIES THAT ARE PART OF LIKE YOU KNOW SORT OF GLOBAL CORPORATIONS WILL HAVE NO PROBLEM TRYING TO ACCESS THIS MONEY. BUT SMALLER BUSINESSES MOM AND POP BUSINESSES WHO MAY BE TARGETED YOU KNOW BY ORGANIZED CRIME MAY FEEL INTIMIDATED OR MIGHT BE HARASSED YOU KNOW- IF THEY'RE SEEN TRYING TO GET COMPENSATION ARE WORK WITH THE GOVERNMENT YOU KNOW SO I JUST THINK WE SHOULD BE THINKING MORE ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS IN REAL LIFE- FOR SMALL BUSINESSES THAT ARE SUFFERING. FROM THIS KIND OF THEFT AND FIGURE OUT HOW TO BE THE MOST HELPFUL TO THEM YOU KNOW- IT'S GREAT TO COME UP WITH IDEAS BUT I THINK WE NEED TO BE AS PRACTICAL AS POSSIBLE WHEN WE'RE TRYING TO HELP FOLKS. READ THANK YOU I'M SO GLAD YOU KNOW I ACTUALLY AM IN RULES- AND SO I DID NOT HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO ASK ABOUT ITEM ELEVEN AND TWELVE AND I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN DO THAT BECAUSE IT IS GREAT YOU. WERE TALKING ABOUT THOSE ITEMS. SO WITH THE CAN JUST. AND WHY OKAY COOL I JUST. THANK YOU MISSOURI. SURE I COULD DO WHATEVER NO. IT IS GREAT I WANTED TO CLOSE WITH RON AND ABOUT- MOVIES A FACT LAST YEAR THERE WERE NUMBER OF STAY COLD THAT RAISED ISSUE AND MO IN THE- AND SO I KNOW- THE YOU'RE OFF SAID YOU HAD HEARD SO I LIKE I SAID I'M CO SIGNING WITH THE GOOD CENTER MENTIONED BECAUSE THIS SHOULD BE PART OF A DISCUSSION THAT WE'RE HAVING AS WE'RE LOOKING AT THIS YEAR'S BUDGET. MANY OF THEM WERE ON THE BRINK OF CLOSURE HAD TO FIND OTHER THINGS THAT THEY DIDN'T WANT TO DO IN ORDER TO STAY OPEN- AND THEY HIRE LOTS OF YOUNG FOLKS AND FOLKS FROM THE COMMUNITY- YOU KNOW IN THOSE POSITIONS AND SO I WANT TO ELEVATE THAT THE OTHER THING IS. THE TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS THAT IT REMAINS ON ALLOCATED- YOU KNOW I WANT YOU WANT TO CONTINUE TO INVESTIGATE THE WHY BEHIND THAT I THINK THERE'S SOME BARRIERS TO ENTRY I WANT TO GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE OF A CULTURAL INSTITUTION THAT'S IN MY DISTRICT THE MUSEUM OF AFRICAN AMERICAN ART IT ALSO HAPPENS TO BE LOCATED IN A DEPARTMENT STORE THE DEPARTMENT STORE WAS CLOSED BECAUSE THE CULPRIT. SO PEOPLE COULDN'T GO TO THE MUSEUM. YOU KNOW SO THAT'S LIKE A REAL LIFE EXAMPLE OF LIKE. A IN A CULTURAL INSTITUTION IN NEED OF SOME HELP. BECAUSE THEY WERE SHOT DOWN AND ACTUALLY THEY WERE NOT ABLE TO PARTICIPATE- IN SOME OF THE FUNDING OPPORTUNITIES AND COMPENSATION OPPORTUNITIES. AND SO. BUT BECAUSE OF THEIR UNIQUE. SITUATION OF WHERE THEY WERE LOCATED. IT ALSO THEY WERE SORT OF CUT OFF SO. AS WE'RE LOOKING AT WAYS TO GET THIS MONEY OUT I'M JUST ASKING YOU TO AND NOT YOU SPECIFICALLY BUT YOU IN GENERAL TO BE A LITTLE MORE OPEN MINDED. AND FLEXIBLE ABOUT SOME OF THE NEEDS THAT MANY OF THESE CULTURAL INSTITUTIONS HAVE. FASTA AND THEN TWELVE YES MANAGE GO SORRY. GO AHEAD MS GRAY I WAS JUST GOING TO SAY HI I WAS JUST GOING TO SAY THAT WE ARE WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE ADVOCATES ON THIS ISSUE- TO HOPEFULLY COME UP WITH A SOLUTION. GREAT AND THEN FOR ITEM NUMBER TWELVE I HAD THE GOOD FORTUNE OF. GOING TO A VISIT CALIFORNIA- FILMING. AND SUPER GREAT- AND THEY ALSO TALK TO ME ABOUT HOW THEY GET THEIR MONEY THAT THEY DID HAVE TO CUT SPENDING THAT THEY ARE STILL SORT OF COLLECTING FEES AND SO I DON'T KNOW IF THIS WAS ASKED BUT- THERE'S FORTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS THAT YOU'RE ASKING FOR- AND SO HALF OF THIS NINETY FIVE IS STILL LEFT SO JUST WANTED TO. HEAR IT FROM MY OWN YEARS OF WHY WE'RE ASKING FOR THE MONEY. BUT MAYBE THAT WAS A MISS GRACE ITEM WELL AS- I CAN I CAN MAYBE HELP MATT COLLEAGUES FROM VISIT CALIFORNIA HAS. OPT OFF I BELIEVE ALL RIGHT. WE'RE GONNA GET YOU WE CAN CERTAINLY GET YOU THE RESPONSE TO THAT BUT IN SHORT WHILE WHILE THE SPENDING FOR THE ENTIRE NINETY FIVE IS NOT COMPLETED YET WE ANTICIPATE ALL HE'S BACK NEVER MIND I'M GONNA GIVE HIM THE TIME. HOW ARE HEARING WOULD YOU MIND READING YOUR QUESTION. WHY ARE YOU ASKING FOR FORTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS WHEN THERE'S ON THE LEFT FROM THE NINETY FIVE EVEN THOUGH I ALSO WANT TO SAY I WENT TO A SAID AND IT WAS REALLY FUN. BUT NONETHELESS THIS IS CALIFORNIA'S MONEY. ABSOLUTELY REALLY GOOD QUESTION THANKS FOR ASKING IT- THE PLAN WAS ALWAYS TO SPREAD THE NINETY FIVE REALLY ACROSS THE TWO MAJOR TRIP PLANNING SEASONS ONE IN THE FALL AND ONE IN THE SPRING SO. WE'RE ABOUT. HALFWAY SPENT ABOUT FORTY FIVE MILLION IN RIGHT NOW- THIS SPRING. SAID AND THAT'LL ACTUALLY START- THIS COMING SUNDAY- YOU'LL SEE A BIG CAMPAIGN LAUNCHED- THE RUN ALL THE WAY INTO MAY AND JUNE- AND THAT WILL- DEPLETE THE REMAINDER OF THE NINETY FIVE MILLION. WELL THAT WAS THE ONE I SAW BEING FILMED BUT NOW THAT WE'RE STARTING TO OPEN UP. FECAL WILL PROBABLY INCREASE. YOU SEE WHERE I'M GOING WITH MY QUESTION YES IT'S ANOTHER REALLY GOOD QUITE. A BIT THE REVENUE IS COLLECTED A YEAR IN ARREARS SO JUST LIKE YOU AND I'M HERE INCOME TAXES- IN APRIL OUR OUR INCOME FROM THE PREVIOUS TWELVE MONTHS- THE- TOURISM FEE IS ASSESSED IN A SIMILAR WAY SO BUSINESSES ARE PAYING RIGHT NOW- ALIGNMENT- REVENUE- FROM THAT THE DARKEST DAYS THE PANDEMIC- AND SO WE'RE NOT REALLY GOING TO BE BACK TO WHOLE OUR PROJECTIONS ON THAT THAT. ASSESSMENT REVENUE INTEL- ARE FISCAL YEAR TWENTY THREE. I GREAT THANK YOU FOR THAT AND THANK YOU FOR COMING BACK. FATMAN CABALLERO HAS A QUESTION- YOU DONT BECAUSE- GOOD QUESTIONS ARE. THANK YOU SIR. ALL RIGHT NOW WE'RE GOING TO MOVE TO ISSUE ITEM NUMBER FIFTEEN. GOBIZ GO AHEAD. WAS IT AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS- MY NAME IS OUT OF TELECOM BUT I NEED IT THAT SENIOR DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF KOBE IS- THE SUPPLY CHAIN DISRUPTION IS A STATE WIDE AND NATIONAL ISSUE CALIFORNIA IS HOME TO THREE OF THE LARGEST CARGO PORTS IN THE COUNTRY OUR TWO LARGEST PORTS LEN LONG BEACH HANDLE APPROXIMATELY 40% OF IMPORTS AND 30% OF THE NATION'S EXPORT. OUR COURTS ARE EXPERIENCING MAJOR DISTRIBUTION CHALLENGES SUCH AS OVERCROWDING OF CONTAINERS AT PORT TERMINALS SHORTAGE OF EQUIPMENT SUCH AS JOCKEYS IN CONTAINERS AND HISTORIC AKHADA CARGO VESSELS THAT EAGER WAITING FOR BIRTH SPACE NOW IN ADDITION TRUCK DRIVERS HAVE BASED ON CERTAIN KEY INCLUDING A LACK OF DETAIL CARGO CONTAINER PICKUP SCHEDULES VESSEL DELAYS CANCELLATIONS AND UNCLEAR DELIVERY DESTINATIONS CORRECT BROWN OPERATORS HAVE ALSO BEEN IMPACTED BY UNCERTAIN CARGO INFORMATION DETAILS. NOW THESE MAJOR SUPPLY CHAIN PROBLEMS ARE HINDERING THE MOVEMENT OF GOODS LEADING TO INCREASED. FOR CONSUMERS AND BUSINESSES AND CREATING NEGATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT NOW TO THE AND OPENS IS REQUESTING THIRTY MILLION FOR OPERATIONAL AND PROCESS IMPROVEMENTS AT THE PORT TO ENABLE EFFICIENT CARGO MOVEMENT REDUCE CONGESTION AND CREATE OPPORTUNITIES TO INCREASE CARGO VOLUME BY PROMOTING AND BUILDING SUPPLY CHAIN EFFICIENCIES A LACK OF A CENTRALIZED DATA SYSTEM HAS CONTRIBUTED TO MUCH OF THE CONFUSION OUTLINED AT THE CHANCE TO THE OPERATOR HI-LO'S. AND IN ORDER TO ENABLE REAL TIME SITUATIONAL UPDATE TO INCREASE COMMUNICATION BETWEEN CARRIERS TRUCKERS OFTEN MY SHIPMENT ROUTES ALLEN ANY ONE HAND OFF AND DATA AND ASSESSMENTS ARE ONE OF THE AREAS THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT VERY CLOSELY SO WE MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS HAPPY ANSWER ANY QUESTION. THANK YOU SO MUCH NOW. WOULD LIKE TO HEAR FROM DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. MERSHON'S DEPARTMENT FINANCE NO COME AT THIS. NOW LIKE TO HEAR FROM THE A. O. BRAIN WITH A LETTER AND ALL OFFICE- THIS PROPOSAL. IS CHALLENGING FOR US TO ABOUT- ITS MERITS BECAUSE IT HAD DIDN'T PROVIDE WE HAVEN'T RECEIVED. LIAM ANY INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT WOULD BE USED FOR- THEY DISCUSSED WAS- USING THE FUNDING TO HELP TO IMPROVE DATA INTEROPERABLE IT- AMONG THE PORTS THE RAILROADS THE OCEAN CARRIERS DRING TERM TERMINAL OPERATORS AND RAILROADS- SO. IF THAT IS THE FINAL PROPOSAL WOULD RAISE TWO CONCERNS THE FIRST IS WHETHER KOBE IS WOULD BE THE MOST APPROPRIATE AGENCY TO ADMINISTER THE GRANT PROGRAM AND THE SECOND WOULD BE WHETHER. IT IS APPROPRIATE TO USE STATE FUNDING TO IMPROVE COMMUNICATIONS AND DATA SYSTEMS FOR THESE PRIVATE FOR PROFIT COMPANIES- AS THEY SHOULD ALL HAVE SUFFICIENT PRIVATE INCENTIVES TO ADOPT- ANY RECOMMENDATIONS REGARDING DID INTERRUPT ABILITY BUT- WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO LEARNING. MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THIS PROPOSAL AS IT DEVELOPS. SOUNDS GOOD NOW I'M GOING TO BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE. MISTER VICE CHAIR. WELL I HAVE TO OBSERVE THAT THIS. THIS TO ME TO BE A EFFORT BY THE ADMINISTRATION TO SAY THEY'RE DOING SOMETHING ABOUT THE PORTS. WHICH REALLY WON'T AMOUNT TO MUCH OF ANYTHING IS A MACRO ISSUE OF GREAT MAGNITUDE GREAT DETRIMENT TO THE AMERICAN ECONOMY. AND PROTECT THE ECONOMY OF CERTAIN AREAS STRICTLY THOSE WHERE THE PORCH. ARE LOCATED AND HE IT'S ALMOST LAUGHABLE TO SAY THE ADMINISTRATION THINKS THAT THEY'RE DOING SOMETHING CONSTRUCTIVE IN THIS PROPOSAL ABOUT THAT FILM I DON'T LOOK AT THIS IS A SERIOUS ATTEMPT AND THEY DON'T IT'S IF YOU'LL TO FIND SO WE'RE GOING TO DO WE'RE JUST DOING AN INFANT INVENTORY AND- REPORT. DATA I DON'T THINK THAT'S GOING TO HELP WITH WHAT'S GOING ON ON THE PORCH WHEN THIS OF MACRO ECONOMIC WORLD ECONOMY. ISSUE THANK YOU FOR THAT SENATOR RON. SENATOR CABALLERO. WELL I HAVE TWO COMMENTS ONE IS- I REALLY WANT TO UNDERSTAND A LITTLE BIT BETTER EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE GOING TO BE FUNDING- BECAUSE THE PARTS ARE A COMPLICATED BUSINESS. AND- YOU KNOW I JUST SPENT. I JUST SPENT THE EIGHT HOURS ON THERE ON THE ROAD DRIVING UP FROM LA AND THE NUMBER OF TRUCKS ON THE ROAD IS SHOCKING- AND REALLY SLOWS DOWN- THE REST OF THE TRAFFIC AND I'M WONDERING IS THAT THE BEST WAY TO MOVE GOODS FROM ONE PART OF THE STATE TO THE OTHER. IS TO PUT THEM ON TRUCKS AND- AND MOVE THEM AROUND- NUMBER ONE NUMBER TWO IS THAT IS THAT- I'VE ALSO SEEN THE- CARRIERS THAT ARE BRINGING IN THESE THIS THESE GOODS. PARKED OUTSIDE THE IBM. THE PORTS AND WE KNOW THAT THOSE KIDS NEED TO GET TO LAND AND THEY NEED TO MOVE AND- IT'S NOT CLEAR TO ME THAT OUR PORTAL IS GOING TO BE THE SOLUTION TO GET THAT TO HAPPEN I'M- I'M NOT SURE I. I'M I'M NOT SURE I UNDERSTAND IN THAT IN THAT. THAT THAT COULD JUST BE ME. EXACTLY WHAT THE WHAT THE- THE PROBLEM IS AND WHAT'S KEEPING US FROM MOVING THE THATTHOSE PRODUCTS- AND THEN FINALLY IT'S- THE QUESTION I HAVE IS WHETHER THE- THIS MORE APPROPRIATELY BELONGS WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION BECAUSE THEY'RE THE ONES THAT ARE. RESPONSIBLE FOR GOOD MOVEMENTS IN THE STATE SO I HAVE A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS- I I'D LIKE TO UNDERSTAND EXACTLY WHY A PORTAL GET TO US. TO MOVE OUR GOODS FASTER IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA NO QUESTION WE'VE GOT TO DO SOMETHING OUR PORTS ARE CRITICALLY IMPORTANT. TRUCKS ON THE ROAD THAT ARE NOT MOVING OR OR OR SHIPS OUTSIDE OF OUR- OF OUR- PORTS THAT ARE JUST SITTING THERE DON'T DON'T HELP IMPROVE THE AIR QUALITY SO THERE'S NO QUESTION WE'VE GOT TO DO SOMETHING BUT I'M NOT SURE THIS IS IT SO. LEAVE IT THERE. ANY RESPONSE. CENTER CABALLERO YES THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- SENATORS SO ALL GREAT GREAT POINTS AND VERY VALID QUESTIONS- TO YOUR FIRST POINT REGARDING THE NUMBER OF TRUCKS ON THE ROAD- AND AS YOU MENTIONED IN THE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT WE'RE SEEING MORE AND MORE OF THOSE EVERY DAY- AND SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT- IS TAKING PLACE CURRENTLY IS WORK ON A FREIGHT THE STATE UNTIL ANY PLAN- WHICH COST AS YOU MENTIONED EARLIER ACTUALLY IS. THAT I LEON WOULD DO CALTRANS- AND SO WE ARE WORKING CLOSELY WITH OUR COLLEAGUES IN INCOME MOVES FORWARD AND THAT'S ACTUALLY EXACTLY WHAT IT'S LOOKING AT RIGHT IS WHAT IS THE BEST WAY TO MOVE- CHECK OUT FOR A MOMENT OF A CARGO- THERE ARE A NUMBER OF THINGS AND PUZZLES THAT ARE ON THE TABLE AND SO DEFINITELY MORE TO COME ON I'M HAPPY TO SHARE SOME INFORMATION FROM AN ONGOING- ADVISORY COMMITTEE THAT NEEDS ON THIS VERY TOPIC- SO ON ON THAT PERSON AND THE SECOND PIECE AFTER THE SCOPE OF THE PROBLEM. AND IT'S ALSO I THINK GOES. BACK TO. I SENATOR NIELSEN- ADJUSTER HOW HOW. YOU KNOW MACRO. AND THAT THIS REALLY IS THE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. I MEAN WE ARE WORKING VERY VERY CLOSE AT HAND WITH HER COUNTER. ON A REGULAR WE ARE- WITH THEM I DON'T KNOW TIMES AND WE- DOING THAT AS A REGULAR CADENCE OF CHECK AND- WITH OUR FEDERAL- ARE PARK ON THE WAY. UP A CAR YOU THAT. HE- WAS LOOKING CLOSE. ACTORS AT. TO DETERMINE WHAT IS THE BEST PATH FORWARD WE KNOW THAT- BECAUSE IT IS SUCH A COMPLEX SYSTEM OF SYSTEMS. WHERE THERE ARE MULTIPLE- AS STAKEHOLDERS INVOLVED ACROSS THE ENTIRE SPECTRUM OF THE SUPPLY CHAIN- BUT YET YOU DON'T HAVE SOME VERY. BASIC INFORMATION ABOUT CONTAINERS FROM EIGHT IZZY RIGHT EVEN HOST PORTS AS WE GET THEM ONTO PROPERTIES AND THEN- I WANT YOU- YOU KNOW MOVE IT MONEY ON WHETHER ON RAIL. OR TRUCKS ETCETERA- WE DON'T HAVE A WE DON'T REALLY TRACK. THIS INFORMATION FROM HER MEDIAN AS WE STOCK- ESPECIALLY THROUGH THE PANDEMIC WITH THE LACK OF. PP EQUIPMENT TO OUR FRONT LINE WORKERS FOR ESSENTIAL WORKERS I MEAN THIS REALLY JUST- IMPACTED AS SIGNIFICANTLY- I THINK SHE'LL. MISTER NELSON AS WELL EARLIER ABOUT YOU KNOW. KIND OF WHY WE'RE DOING THAT- SO THERE pISSUED- IN FALL THAT REALLY DIRECTED THE GOVERNOR DIRECTED US ALL TO WORK TOGETHER ON FINDING- BOTH ASHER AND LONGER TERM SOLUTIONS. AND ONE OF THOSE HAS BEEN- THERE'S A RECENT ANNOUNCEMENT THAT WAS MADE- EARLIER- THIS WEEK WITH THE USDA- IN REGARD TO OUR AG EXPORTERS THERE JUST ONE. PLAYER IT OF THE MANY THAT WERE SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED. TO THE TUNE OF TWO POINT ONE BILLION DOLLARS IN JUST. A MATTER OF MONTHS LAST YEAR I- BUT THEY HIT JUST DIDN'T. REDUCED THE ECONOMY AND JUST. WRITER CONTAINERS WERE SHIPPED BACK TO EACH AND D. N. R. I. X. WERE REAL STRUGGLING ESPECIALLY ONLY GROWERS. WHICH WE ARE A TOP TEN X. AND SO THEY WERE REALLY STRUGGLING. TO BE ABLE TO GET THEIR OUT TO MARKET CALL THAT CAN. OUR PARTNERS. I THROUGH YOU. WERE VERY TO WORK ON THIS- SCIENTISTS CONTAINER. THIS PUBLIC SECTOR PORT OF OAKLAND HAS ANNOUNCED A TWENTY TWO ACRE- ON ON THEIR PROPERTY I TO BE ABLE TO HELP SPECIFICALLY WITH. THIS ISSUE AND SO IT REALLY IS TAKING AN ENTIRE TEAM IS TAKING ALL HANDS ON DECK. TO REALLY PUSH YOU AND FINDING SOLUTIONS AND STUFF- TO YOUR POINT SENATOR. IN REGARDING WHETHER THE PORTAL IS NECESSARILY THE RIGHT APPROACH WE ARE WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH OUR STAKEHOLDERS ACROSS YOU KNOW AGAIN ALL SPECTRUMS BUT- CLOSELY WITH THE POOREST. AND THEY ARE ULTIMATELY- ALSO PUBLIC ENTITIES- AND THEY ARE THE LANDLORDS RIGHT AND SO WE'RE WORKING CLOSELY WITH THEM. ON ESTABLISHING WHAT WHAT MAKES ME LOOK LIKE SO WE WILL HAVE MORE INFORMATION TO COME I'M HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOU AND YOUR TEAM AS WE DEVELOP. CAN I SEE MY COLLEAGUE AT FINANCE OTHER HAND. UP TOMORROW I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAD ANYTHING THAT. THANK YOU IF I MAY I JUST LIKE TO CLEAR THAT- THIS- THIS PROPOSAL. IS OF A MUCH LARGER PROPOSAL FOR THE FORKS AND WITCHES AND SUPPLY CHAIN RESILIENCE AND PORT INFRASTRUCTURE. INVESTMENTS AND WE'D BE HAPPY TO PROVIDE THAT PROPOSAL TO- COMMITTEE STAFF IF THAT'S HELPFUL I'M- WE JUST WANTED TO CLARIFY THAT WE INCLUDED AT THIS INVESTMENT IN THE BUDGET. TO SIGNAL THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS COMMITTED TO TRYING TO IMPROVE DATA SHARING AMONG SUPPORTS AND ALL OF THOSE PIECES OF THE LARGER PROPOSAL. AND THE ISSUE OF DATA INTER OPERABILITY IS COMPLEX THIS IS A VERY. COMPLICATED ISSUE. MINISTRATION IS- CONTINUE TO WORK WITH STAKEHOLDERS TO FURTHER REFINE THIS PROPOSAL AND WE'RE ALSO MONITORING ON WHAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS DOING IN THIS SPACE AS WELL. SO WE WILL LIKELY SUBMIT AS A SPRING PER PROPOSAL TO REFLECT THE OUTCOMES. OF THOSE AND VARIOUS DISCUSSIONS. THAT'S ALL HELPFUL THANKYOU MUCH LOOK FORWARD TO GETTING THE INFORMATION. THANK YOU SENATOR CAFIERO I JUST WANNA ECHO THE COMMENTS MADE BY MY- COMMITTEE MEMBERS IT BECAUSE IT I THINK MISTER WEATHERFORD WAS BEING KIND WHEN HE SAID IT'S CHALLENGING TO EVALUATE. SO I THINK I TOO AM GOING TO WAIT UNTIL SPRING BECAUSE IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU GUYS NEED THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS TO HELP YOU FIGURE OUT WHAT THE PROBLEMS ARE- AND THAT. SORT OF MAKES SENSE BUT THEN TO EVERYONE'S POINT IT'S AN INCREDIBLY COMPLICATED AND NUANCED ISSUE AND- IT'S ALSO ABOUT FIGURING OUT WHAT WE HAVE PER VIEW TO DO ARE. AND WHAT ALL OF THE REAL PROBLEMS ARE AND WHAT THE PROBLEMS ARE THAT WE CAN FIX. SO MOVING ON THE ISSUE NUMBER SIXTEEN INCLUSIVE INNOVATION HUB PROGRAM EXPANSION- GOBIZ.

YES THANK YOU- THIS IS BRIAN WITH A FORD WITH LEGISLATIVE ANALYST AGAIN- D. THIS SERVICE THIS INITIATIVE THE INCLUSIVE INNOVATION HUB WAS JUST FUNDED IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE IS STILL I'M IN THE PROCESS OF BEING IMPLEMENTED. WE THINK THAT INCREASING THE NUMBER OF INCLUSIVE INNOVATION HUBS FROM THIRTEEN I'M SORRY FROM TEN TO THIRTEEN IN ORDER TO BETTER ALIGN THE PROGRAM WITH THE SURF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT INITIATIVE COULD HAVE MERIT. I'M OTHERWISE WE THINK TO PROVIDING YOU FUNDING FOR THIS PROGRAM NOW WOULD BE A BIT PREMATURE AS IT IN THE NOTES WOULD RECOMMEND THAT YOU COLLECT MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THESE PROGRAMS BEFORE MAKING FURTHER CHANGES TO IT. THANK GOD I'M GONNA OPEN IT UP TO THAT COMMITTEE BRING IT BACK RATHER SENATOR BICYCLE HE'S GONE OKAY. SENATOR ROTH. THANK YOU MANAGER JUST A QUICK QUESTION- WITH REGARD TO THIS- INNOVATION HUB PROGRAM HOW DO YOU PLAN ON HOW HAVE YOU BEEN PUSHING THE INFORMATION OUT TO OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES AND REGIONS- SO THAT. THAT INDIVIDUALS AND ENTITIES NO TO. KNOW ABOUT THE AVAILABILITY THE FUNDING AND KNOW THE PROCESS OF LEVERAGING OUR REGIONAL ADVISORS ON A TWO MAY COME OUR CONSTITUENTS AVAILABLE ARE SEIZING- AWARE OF THE AVAILABLE AND FUNDING FOR THIS PROGRAM.

TEN AYE HUBS LATER IN THE WEEK. SO IN TERMS OF YOUR- I FORGET THE TERM YOU MANAGER YOUR- YOUR REGIONAL CONTACTS LEVINE DID DOES THAT WHAT DOES THAT INCLUDE IS THAT INCLUDE THE- A COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE- WELL BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT CENTERS I I'M JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND HOW THE INFORMATION.

I'M YES SO ARE REGIONALLY FISER SAID AND WE HAVE A ONE MINUTE WE HAVE THREE REGIONS IN THE STATE NORTH CENTRAL AND SOUTH AND- WE HAVE A REGIONAL ADVISOR ASSIGNED TO EACH REGION AND THE REGION- SUPPORTS DEAN ON ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND- SMALL BUSINESS ECO SYSTEM ACROSS THE STATE.

O.'S COMMENTS- I'D LIKE TO KNOW A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT- INFORMATION ABOUT THE PROGRAMS- I GUESS WHAT MY BIGGEST CONCERN IS WE FIND. THESE HUBS AND WE WE'VE I THINK WHEN WE'RE GONNA NEED SOME WAY TO ENSURE THAT THEY CONTINUE AFTERWARDS SO THEY WE DON'T JUST FUNDAMENT AND THEY GO AWAY BUT I ALSO KNOW THAT IT TAKES- SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF RESOURCES TO BE. DOING WORK WITH THE SMALL BUSINESSES IT'S A TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE IT MAKES ALL THE DIFFERENCE IN THE WORLD SO MARC MARON'S THAT THAT YOU CAN GET US. TO BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE OUTCOMES OF THE INNOVATION HUBS ARE. AND HOW THEY EVALUATE THEIR SUCCESS AND EITHER IS TO THE REGION OR TO THE BUSINESSES THAT THEY'VE HELPED- WOULD BE. REALLY HELPFUL AS WELL. I'M IS CENTER COMING HERE I WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS ON THE SISTINE ABILITY OF THE ON INCLUSIVE INNOVATION HUBS BECAUSE THAT IS AN ISSUE ON A VISIT LAST YEAR'S FUNDING WAS TO REBOOT THAT PROGRAM AND ONE OF THE REASONS WHY THE PROGRAM NEEDED TO REBOOT IS BECAUSE THE PREVIOUS PROGRAM DID NOT HAVE SIGNIFICANT FUNDING. ASSOCIATED WITH THAT ONE OF OUR FEARS ABOUT THE PROGRAM NOW IS EXACTLY WHAT YOU JUST STATED WE WANT TO ENSURE THE SUSTAINABILITY AND LONG TERM VIABILITY OF THE HOT AND WE BELIEVE THAT WE NEED MORE THAN ONE YEAR FUNDING TO DO SO EXISTS PROPOSAL HELPS US ACCOMPLISH THAT SECONDLY WE WOULD LIKE FOR THEM TO BE ABLE TO ATTRACT ADDITIONAL FUNDING AND CAPITAL FOR THE BUSINESSES THAT ARE EACH YOU NEED AN ACCELERATED TO THESE PROGRAMS AND WE KNOW THAT SUSTAINABILITY AND VIABILITY IS IMPORTANT. TO BEING ABLE TO CREATE A KIND IN THE ENGINE THAT SUPPORTS EMERGING ENTREPRENEURSHIP. ACROSS THE STATE. THANK YOU FOR THAT I APPRECIATE THAT. THIS DIRECTIVE UNICORN. OKAY YOU KNOW I DON'T EITHER I BEST JUST BEEN ALERTED THAT WE'RE GOING TO LOSE THE PHONE LINES AT FIVE SO I'M GONNA TRY TO JUST COSIGN WITH SOME OF THE COMMENTS MADE BY- MY- FELLOW COMMITTEE MEMBERS. WE'RE GONNA NOW MOVES TO ISSUE NUMBER SEVENTEEN LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO STAY IN ABILITY FIND WE'D LIKE TO HEAR FROM GOBIZ. GOOD AFTERNOON SURE CONGER AND FELLOW SENATORS MY NAME IS KIND OF VERY SENIOR ADVISER FOR BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT OVER GO BIZ. WITH THIS INITIATIVE ARE REQUESTING FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION A ONE TIME GENERAL FUND DOLLARS STARTING IN FISCAL YEAR TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR. TO PROVIDE SHORT TERM GRANTS TO LOCAL JURISDICTIONS FACING SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES TO THEIR NEAR TERM BUDGET SUSTAINABILITY BUT DEMONSTRATE A CLEAR COMMITMENT TO ADVANCING A MORE CLIMATE RESILIENT AND DIVERSIFIED ECONOMY. THESE GRANTS WILL INJECT FUNDS INTO COUNTY LED PROJECTS THEY'RE AIMED AT PROCESS IMPROVEMENT ECONOMIC DIVERSIFICATION CLIMATE TECHNOLOGY. I LIKED. JOB MOBILITY AND JOB CREATION. AS EASY COMPANIES GRAPPLE WITH THE IMPACTS OF COVER NINETEEN AND CLIMATE CHANGE. THESE GRANTS WILL OFFER FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY TO THE QUALIFIED COUNTIES IN EBELING INVESTMENT AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR FUTURE ECONOMIC RESILIENCE WITHOUT THE NEED TO REDUCE UNNECESSARY ALLOCATIONS FOR VITAL LOCAL CONSTITUENT SERVICES. ACCORDING TO QUESTIONS MA'AM. THANK YOU SO MUCH AND DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. JOHNSON FINANCE AND NO COMMENT AT THIS TIME. MISTER WEATHERFORD LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE WE RECOMMEND REJECTING THIS PROPOSAL BECAUSE IT DOES NOT PROVIDE A DETAILED JUSTIFICATION FOR THE AMOUNT OF FUNDING REQUESTED FOR THE CRITERIA THAT WOULD BE USED TO MAKE THESE GRANTS WE KNOW THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS STILL DEVELOPING SOME OTHER RELATED STATEWIDE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT INITIATIVES. STAND AS THE FUNDING WAS REQUESTED FOR TWENTY TWENTY THREE TWENTY TWENTY FOUR IF YOU DO THINK THAT ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR ECONOMIC DIVERSIFICATION PROJECTS COULD BE WARRANTED YOU COULD DIRECT ADMINISTRATION TO RETURN WITH A MORE MATURE PROPOSAL IN THE NEXT BUDGET CYCLE. THANK YOU FOR THAT THAT WAS KIND OF A DROP IN MY- MISTER VICE CHAIR. MADAM CHAIR I CERTAINLY RECOMMEND NO ACTION ON THIS PROBABLY NEVER IN FACT THIS LOOK LIKE A SLUSH FUND. FOR GOVERNMENT AND WE DON'T KNOW ANY IDEA OF THE FOR THE DETAILS A MATTER OF THIS MAGNITUDE THIS AMOUNT OF MONEY. SUSTAINING LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THAT'S SOMETHING THAT SHOULD BE EXHAUSTIVELY NEGOTIATED THROUGH A FULL LEGISLATIVE PROCESS LIKE THE COMMITTEE HEARINGS NOT JUST BRIEF SUBCOMMITTEE HEARINGS AND THEN A BIG BUDGET HEARING AND VOTE- WE HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THIS IS GOING TO MEAN. WHAT HOW THE MONEY WILL BE A PORTION. LRGE SMALL MEDIUM WHAT KIND OF COUNTIES. CITIES THIS REALLY CONCERNS ME IS THE IT'S CERTAINLY NOT WORTHY OF ANY ACTION TODAY. BUT AT THIS POINT ARE YOU NOT WORTHY OF INACTION EVER. ALL RIGHT THANKS FOR THAT- SENATOR CAFIERO. I HAVE SOME REAL CONCERNS ABOUT THIS- I NEEDED TO DO A DETAILED JUSTIFICATION. I THINK IT'S JUST THE AMALGAMATION OF A LOT OF WORDS LIKE CLIMATE CHANGE AND ECONOMIC DIVERSIFICATION I NEED TO KNOW IT IT'S GONNA FUND BEFORE I IDEA SUPPORT ITSELF- THANK YOU SAN ROCK THANK YOU MANAGER YOU KNOW I SHE- THE- OF MY COLLEAGUES BUT- THEN OBVIOUSLY WE NEED TO KNOW MORE DETAIL AND TOO OFTEN WE- DO APPROVE. OF PROPOSALS HERE AND THIS LEGISLATURE THAT ARE NOT FULLY- FLUSHED OUT AND WE MAY NEVER FIND OUT WHAT THE DETAILS ARE UNLESS WE DO OVERSIGHT BUT- IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE I DO THINK THAT THERE ARE. LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IN THE STATE THAT ARE SIGNIFICANTLY CHALLENGED AND FUNDING TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAS BEEN SIGNIFICANTLY CHALLENGED NOT ONLY BY THE PANDEMIC BUT BY A VARIETY OF OTHER. ACTIONS THAT WE'VE TAKEN IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO. I THINK THIS THE CONCEPT BEARS FURTHER DISCUSSION AND I HOPE WE ARE ABLE TO DO THAT. THE WEATHER IN THE CONTEXT OF THE SUB COMMITTEE OR IN THE LARGER BUDGET COMMITTEE. I ANY HEARING THAT'S APPROPRIATELY SIZED TO FIT THE ISSUE. AND MAKE SOME DECISIONS AS TO WHAT WE DO WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENT FUNDING- IN THIS PARTICULAR STATE SO THOSE ARE JUST MY COMMENTS I APPRECIATE THE TIME THANKS. THANK YOU SENATOR ROTH- I JUST WANT TO ECHO THAT THERE SEEM TO BE SOME MERITS TO- THE PROPOSAL AND YET SAID IS INCREDIBLY.

GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR NUMBERS MY NAME IS JENNIFER URBAN AND I'M THE CHIEF OF BUDGETS AND ACCOUNTING WITH THE STATE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE WE THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS THE CALIFORNIA STATE PAROLE SYSTEM BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL. AS HE WAS REQUESTING INCREASED RESOURCES TO SUPPORT THE C. S. P. S. PROJECT THROUGH THE CONTINUATION OF THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY PROJECT APPROVAL LIFECYCLE. THREE THESE RESOURCES ARE CRITICAL TO THE PROJECT SUCCESS AS A SOLUTION DESIGN DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION WILL COMMENCE AS A PROJECT ANTICIPATES SELECTING A SYSTEM INTEGRATOR IN FISCAL YEAR TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE. IN ADDITION THE DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN RESOURCES AS A PRIMARY BUSINESS PARTNER ON THE PROJECT IS REQUESTING RESOURCES TO FULLY PARTICIPATE IN THE NEXT PHASE OF THE PROJECT AND TO ADHERE TO REQUEST FOR PROJECT RELATED ACTIVITIES WITHIN THE AGREED UPON TIMELINE. THESE RESOURCES WILL ENABLE KALINJAR SUCCESSFULLY MANAGE THE H. R. COMPONENT OF THE LARGE SCALE STATEWIDE PROJECTS. WITH ME TODAY IS CHRIS MAILED THE CS PS PROJECT DIRECTOR IN HOME NOW PROVIDE A STATUS UPDATE ON THE PROJECT. OKAY MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS CHRIS MAYO AND I AM THE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE PAYROLL SYSTEM PROJECT AT THE STATE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE. AS MISERABLE AND MENTIONED THE C. S. P. S. PROJECT CONTINUES WORKING THROUGH THE STATE FOUR STAGES OF THE PROJECT APPROVAL LIFE CYCLE KNOWN AS POWELL. WAS STAGE ONE HAVING BEEN APPROVED BACK IN OCTOBER OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN IN STAGE TWO HAVING BEEN APPROVED IN APRIL AND JUST LAST YEAR. OVER THE LAST YEAR THE PROJECT TEAM HAS BEEN WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY STATEWIDE TECHNOLOGY PROCUREMENT DIVISION ON STAGE THREE ACTIVITIES. THAT INCLUDE DEVELOPING SOLICITATION MATERIALS SUCH AS THE REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL IN THE STATEMENT OF WORK. AND FINALIZING THE EVALUATION METHODOLOGY. THE STATE STREET IS NEARING ITS AND THE PROJECT TEAM IS LOOKING FORWARD TO STAGE FOR PROCUREMENT ACTIVITIES TO BE SCHEDULED OUT OVER THE NEXT YEAR THAT WILL INCLUDE A BETTER QUALIFICATION PHASE A PROOF OF CONCEPT PHASE. AND FINALLY AN NEGOTIATION PHASE ALL CULMINATING IN THE IDENTIFICATION THE SOFTWARE SOLUTION AND SYSTEMS INTEGRATION BENDER IT'S AT THIS POINT THE LEGISLATURE WILL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO WEIGH IN ON THE PROJECT BEFORE IT PROCEEDS WITH CONTRACT EXECUTION. PROJECT TEAM CONTINUES TO MANAGE THE PROJECT WITH ALL THE RIGOR REQUIRED FOR A PROJECT OF THIS SIZE AND COMPLEXITY. AS I'VE SAID BEFORE AND I'LL KEEP SAYING IT AGAIN THAT HOW IS THIS PROJECTS FRIEND. IS IT DEMANDS FOLLOWING A VERY DISCIPLINED APPROACH TO PROJECT MANAGEMENT. BUDGET TEAM APPRECIATES THE OVERSIGHT PROVIDED BY THE DEPARTMENT TECHNOLOGIES PROJECT APPROVAL AND OVERSIGHT DIVISION. AND THE PROJECT'S OWN CONTRACTED INDEPENDENT VERIFICATION AND VALIDATION VENDOR IN THE PROJECT MAKES COURSE CORRECTIONS BASED ON THEIR ADVICE. BOTH OF THESE OVERSIGHT PROVIDERS OF SERVICES TO DOUBLE CHECK AND BALANCE OF THE PROJECT DURING THE PLANNING PHASE. FINALLY THE PROJECT ACTIVELY MONITORS RISKS AND ISSUES AND REPORTS THEM TO THE EXECUTIVE STEERING COMMITTEE AT ITS BI MONTHLY MEETINGS. TO ENSURE SWIFT ACTION IS TAKEN TO ADDRESS THEM. BUDGET ALSO PRODUCES MONTHLY PERFORMANCE SCHEDULE AND RISK AND ISSUE REPORTS THAT ARE AVAILABLE FOR REVIEW BY ALL STAKEHOLDERS. BANKERS EVERYONE TO REVIEW THESE REPORTS BECAUSE THEY DO CONTAIN VALUABLE INFORMATION IN THE INSURANCE ALL STAKEHOLDERS REMAIN INFORMED ABOUT THE PROGRESS OF THE PROJECT. AND THE RISK IN ISSUES THAT IT FACES WITH THAT'LL BE HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU SO MUCH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. NO ALL THE OFFICE IS THE BRIAN METZ HERE WE GO. HELLO BRIAN MINSKER LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE- WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE APPROVED THE PLANNING DOLLARS IN POSITIONS IN THIS PROPOSAL BUT THE FOR ITS CONSIDERATION OF THE REMAINING EIGHTY THREE POINT THREE MILLION IN FUNDING. FOR PROJECT DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR WE REYES THREE MAIN CONCERNS WITH APPROVING DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION FUNDS AT THIS TIME. FIRST THE LEGISLATURE DOES NOT HAVE ADEQUATE INFORMATION NOW TO APPROVE THESE FUNDS KEY PIECES OF INFORMATION ARE NOT AVAILABLE INCLUDING A FINAL BASELINE COST SCHEDULE AND SCOPE FOR THE PROJECT FIND A VENDOR CONTRACTS AND OTHER SUPPORTING PROJECT DOCUMENTATION. SECOND THE PROJECTS ASSUME TIMELINE TO COMPLETE PLANNING IS OPTIMISTIC. DOES NOT ACCOUNT FOR CURRENT AND POSSIBLE FUTURE DELAYS FROM ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESSES PROCUREMENT AND OTHER RELATED ACTIVITIES SUCH AS AGREEMENTS FROM BARGAINING UNITS AND INTEGRATIONS WITH OTHER SYSTEMS SUCH AS FRISCO. THIRD THE PROJECTS PROPOSED SCHEDULE PROVIDES THE ADMINISTRATION WITH FLEXIBILITY TO DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT THE PROJECT BUT AT THE COST OF LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT. THE PROPOSED THE S. P. S. I. T. PROJECT IF APPROVED WOULD BE ONE OF THE COSTLIEST AND MOST COMPLEX IT PROJECTS UNDERTAKEN BY THE STATE. THE PRELIMINARY COST ESTIMATE FOR THIS PROJECT IS SEVEN HUNDRED AND SIXTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS GENERAL FUND. WITH THE PRELIMINARY TIMELINE OF FIVE AND A HALF YEARS FOR DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION THAT AFFECTS MANY STATE DEPARTMENTS. WE FIND THAT THE BENEFITS OF STARTING THE PROJECTS DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF FEW MONTHS EARLIER DO NOT OUTWEIGH THE RISKS OF OUR HURRIED LEGISLATIVE REVIEW OF THE PROJECT PLAN. AND HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. OKEY DOKEY. MISTER VICE CHAIR NIELSEN SENATOR RON. I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF I WANNA STIRRED MADAM CHAIR I. I'M YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN THROUGH SEVERAL OF THESE BIG IT PROJECTS WHILE SITTING ON HIS COMMITTEE PER TO MY SABBATICAL. IT. SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IS I THOUGHT WE WERE DOING IT PROCUREMENT IN SMALLER BITE SIZE COMPONENTS THAT GAVE US THE OPPORTUNITY TO FIVE RISKS OF DEFICIENCIES AND REPAIR. IS THAT CONCEPT EMBEDDED IN THIS IN THIS IN THIS PROJECT FORMED- THE STATEMENT OF WORK IN OUR REQUIREMENTS WE ARE YOU KNOW POSING THAT QUESTION TO THE VENDOR COMMUNITY TO SEE YOU KNOW. WHAT IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH DO THEY RECOMMEND FOR THE SIZE OF PROJECT IT'S QUITE POSSIBLE THAT THEY'LL COME BACK WITH A PROPOSAL THAT DOES DO WHAT YOU'RE EXACTLY SAYING ALTERNATIVELY THEY MIGHT YOU KNOW RECOGNIZE THAT A LOT OF THE LINES OF BUSINESS OUR INTERVIEW LATED AND THEY'LL SAY WE THINK WE SHOULD IMPLANT YOU ALL OF THE FUNCTIONALITY BY PHASES OF DEPARTMENT AS OPPOSED TO INDIVIDUAL LINES OF BUSINESS BUT- ANSWER YOUR QUESTION YES THIS IS REALLY OPPOSED TO THE VENDOR COMMUNITY TO PROPOSE BACK TO THE STATE- THE CORRECT IMPLEMENTATION METHODOLOGY. WELL I APPRECIATE THAT RESPONSE AND AS I. SUSPECTED BEFORE PRESERVES ASKING MY QUESTION AND MY QUESTION PERHAPS. IS A BIT PREMATURE AND THAT YOU WILL NEED TO MOVE FORWARD WITH YOUR PLANNING PROCESS AND AT SOME POINT- WILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO ASK THOSE QUESTIONS AS YOU EXPLAIN. YOUR BUSINESS PLAN FOR MOVING THIS FORWARD- THERE IS CLEARLY NO DOUBT IN MY MIND THAT WE NEED TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THE STATE PAYROLL SYSTEM PROJECT THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN DONE- YEARS AGO AS I RECALL IT WAS ATTEMPTED YEARS AGO- AND THE SYSTEM WE'RE USING TODAY- AS I RECALL- IS USING- PROGRAMMING- TECHNIQUES THAT. WAS IN PLACE WHEN I WAS A FRESHMAN IN COLLEGE WHICH- IS A LONG TIME AGO SO THANK YOU FOR CONTINUING TO WORK ON THIS CONTENT THANK YOU TO THE TEAM FOR. CONTINUING TO- TO DO WHAT THEY DO AND MOVE THIS FORWARD AND THANK YOU FOR PUTTING UP WITH MY QUESTION. YOUR MANAGER THANK YOU SENATOR ROCKWELL I SUPPORT ANYTHING THAT WILL ALLOW US TO. PAY STATE EMPLOYEES MORE EFFICIENTLY. AND IT'S A HUGE. DOLLAR AMOUNT- AND I APPRECIATE THE QUESTIONS ASKED BY SENATOR ROTH BECAUSE I HAD SIMILAR ONES- JUST ABOUT THE GENERAL STRUCTURE. ALSO ABOUT SORT OF LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT WITH THIS PROCESS YOU KNOW IF A VENDOR HASN'T BEEN SELECTED. KNOW WHAT ROLE CAN WE PLAY AND BEING SUPPORTIVE IN THAT- BUT THIS SEEMS LIKE THE BEGINNING STEPS OF A JOURNEY. YES I SEE SILENCE I WILL EXACTLY SHAKING HEADS OKAY VERY GOOD SO WITH THAT- IF NO ONE ELSE DOES ANYONE ELSE HAVE ANYTHING TO ADD THAT'S ON CAN ASSUME WORLD. NOW OKAY. SO WE WILL NOW MOVE ON TO ANYONE WANTING TO PROVIDE PUBLIC COMMENT REGARDING ITEMS ON THE AGENDA SO AS A REMINDER TODAY'S PARTICIPANT NUMBER. IS EIGHT SEVEN SEVEN. TWO TWO SIX EIGHT ONE SIX THREE AND THE ACCESS CODE IS. SEVEN TWO SEVEN SIX TWO TWO. FOUR SIX TWO. DUE TO CONSTRAINTS REGARDING THE LENGTH OF HEARINGS TECHNOLOGY CONSIDERATIONS AND CLEANING PROTOCOLS COMMITTEE CHAIRS MAY INSTITUTE TIME LIMITS ON TESTIMONY AND I'M GOING TO DO THAT TODAY I AM TELLING YOU THAT MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC PROVIDING COMMENT. PLEASE KEEP THEIR REMARKS WITHIN ONE MINUTE BECAUSE WE ALSO HAVE A TIME LINE WITH REGARDS TO- HAVING ACCESS TO THE PHONE LINES. NOW LET'S BEGIN WITH ANY WITNESSES HERE IN THE HEARING ROOM. I SEE SOMEONE. GO HEAD SIR. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS ALEX TORRES WAS STRATEGIES THREE SIXTY ON BEHALF OF THE NATIONAL INDEPENDENT VENUE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA. WANAKA COMMENTS HE MADE AN ASSEMBLY BUDGET SUB FOR REGARDING IN USE GRANT PROGRAM BY FOR STATE OUR THANKS TO DIRECTOR GRAY- THE CALIBER TEAM IN THE GOBIZ TEAMS WERE BEING EXTREMELY RESPONSIVE AND RECEPTIVE TO OUR CONCERNS WE HAVE SOME POTENTIAL FIXES TO ISSUES REFERENCE DATE WITH NEXT CODES AND OTHER ISSUES- THAT WE WORK TOGETHER ON- WITH CALIFORNIA ARTS ADVOCATES AND CAL NONPROFITS FIXES THAT WE THINK MAKES SENSE AND- LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING THAT. THAT CONVERSATION- COALITION IS FOCUSED ON MAKING SURE WE'RE MAXIMIZING THESE FUNDS WERE WORRIED ABOUT IS THE EXISTENCE OF LEFTOVER FUNDS FROM THIS PROGRAM THAT COULD HAVE GONE TO WAR THE APPLICANTS.WHO WERE EITHER DENIED OR JUST DIDN'T APPLY UNDER SOME OF THESE UNINTENTIONAL DISQUALIFIER IS. ON THE CONVERSATION ON MOVIE THEATERS THE PROGRAM WAS INITIALLY CONCEIVED BY OUR AFOREMENTIONED COALITION OF ARTS ADVOCATES WITH A FOCUS ON LIVE EVENTS AND INDEPENDENTLY OWNED ENTITIES- THE INDEPENDENTLY OWNED MOVIE THEATERS WERE INITIALLY ENGAGED IN THESE CONVERSATIONS BUT FELL OFF ALONG THE WAY BUT I UNDERSTAND EVERY CASE WE HAVE HAD SOME INITIAL CONVERSATIONS WITH THEM- GIVEN THE NUMBER OF OTHERWISE. VENT THEN USED- OPTED TO NOT A OR OTHERWISE INELIGIBLE BECAUSE OF SOME OF THESE BARRIERS. IN ADDITION TO MOVIE THEATERS WHO OBVIOUSLY DIDN'T APPLY. WE'RE VERY EAGER TO DISCUSS THE POSSIBILITY OF AN AUGMENTATION TO THIS PROGRAM ALONG WITH A SECOND ROUND OF APPLICATIONS WITHIN AMENDED ELIGIBILITY GUIDELINES. SO WE CAN CAPTURE ALL OF THESE FOLKS THAT HAVE BEEN HARMED BY THE PROVIDER SHUTDOWNS NOTABLY THE ONLY CRIME VARIANT WHICH- YOU KNOW IT IT JUST BECAUSE THE PROGRAM PASSED DIDN'T MEAN. SHOWS YOU KNOW. STOPPING STOP RIGHT THERE- MAKRAN VARIANT SHUT DOWN A LOT MORE SHOWS.
