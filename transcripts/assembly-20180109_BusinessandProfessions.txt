CHAIR NOTICES THE ABSENCE OF A QUORUM AT THIS POINT IN TIME AND SO I WILL BEGIN. WITH ITEM NUMBER ONE SINCE WE HAVE OUR COMMITTEE MEMBER AND AUTHOR. PRESENCE AND SO BEGINNING WITH THE ITEM NUMBER ONE AB IS SEVEN FORTY NINE SEVEN WHATEVER YOU LIKE. LOW AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS EIGHTY SEVEN FOUR NINE PROVIDES A MUCH NEEDED UPDATE TO THE REAL ESTATE LAW WHICH HAS NOT BEEN UPDATED IN DECADES. THE BILL AS AMENDED IS THE RESULT OF MANY STAKEHOLDER MEETINGS INTENDED TO ENSURE THAT THE PROCESS IS A TRANSPARENT ONE. AND THAT EXISTING CONSUMER PROTECTIONS ARE PRESERVED. THERE'D BEEN SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO THE PRACTICE OF REAL ESTATE OVER THE YEARS WHILE MOST OF THE. OF THE EXISTING LAW WAS ENACTED WHEN IT WAS NO INTERNET AND IF A PERSON WANTS TO LEARN ABOUT OF PROPERTIES THEY HAVE LITTLE ALTERNATIVE BUT TO GO TO THE BROKER'S OFFICE AND LOOK AT A BOOK OF PROPERTIES. NOW CONSUMERS CAN GET DETAILED INFORMATION ON LISTED PROPERTIES ON THEIR PHONE. NEW TYPES OF BROKERAGE MODELS HAVE EMERGED MANY LICENSING MATTERS ARE NOW HANDLED ELECTRONICALLY THROUGH E. LICENSING WITH THE BUREAU OF REAL ESTATE RATHER THAN THROUGH MAIL OR PAPER FORMS. AND TRANSACTIONS TAKE PLACE PRIMARILY THROUGH ELECTRONIC FORMS. THIS BILL UPDATES LAW TO RECOGNIZE THE LICENSING AND ELECTRONIC SIGNATURES IT CLARIFIES IN ACCORDANCE WITH CURRENT LAW AND VARYING BROKERAGE MODELS THAT A LICENSEE MAY BE RETAINED BY A BROKER. AS THE INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR AFFILIATED WITH THE BROKER OR AN EMPLOYEE OF THE PROGRAM ALSO MAKES TECHNICAL CHANGES TO THE LAW TERMINOLOGY TO MAKE THE. TERMINOLOGY MORE UNDERSTANDABLE TO CONSUMERS AND MORE CONSISTENT. WE CAN COMMIT TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH STAKEHOLDERS TO RESOLVE ANY OUTSTANDING.
