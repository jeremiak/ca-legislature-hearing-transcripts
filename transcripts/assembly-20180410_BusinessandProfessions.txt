AND WE HAVE STRESSED THAT THE PRIVACY COMPONENT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED AND THIS BILL WHILE WELL INTENTIONED AND WE AGREE THAT OPENING UP. TO OTHER STATES WILL BE A GREAT TOOL FOR PROVIDERS. THAT IT NEEDS TO BE TAPPED SECURED FIRST AND THAT THE DEPARTMENT NEEDS TO PUT INTO PLACE SOME PRIVACY MEASURES. AND THAT THE STATE COULD USE TO PUT SOME PRIVACY MEASURES INTO THE BILL THAT WOULD ENSURE THAT PATIENT DATA IS PROTECTED BEFORE WE OPEN UP THE DATABASE TO SHARING ACROSS STATE LINES. AND SO WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE CHAIR TO CONTINUING TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE. AND THAT. I HAVE CONFIDENCE THAT MOVING FORWARD WE WILL SEE SOME RESOLUTION TO THIS. AND WE. RESPECTFULLY ASK.

THE NEXT TWO BILLS AGAIN. WITH RESPECT I DO IT INCH BOTH ENJOY AND AYE AYE RECOMMENDATION AND SO ALLOW ME TO SEE A BRIEF IN THESE COMMENTS OF THIS IS AB SEVENTEEN FIFTY TWO WHICH ADDRESSES THIS WATER CRISIS. A WITH RESPECT TO ADDING THE SCHEDULE FIVE DRUGS TO THE DATABASE CURRENTLY CHAIRS TRACK SCHEDULE TO THROUGH FOR. US SO EVERY OTHER PRESCRIBE CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES SUBSTANCE IS ALREADY REPORTED IN THE DATABASE SCHEDULE FIVE INCLUDES A COUGH SYRUPS AYE CONTAINING CODEINE WHICH IS KNOWN AS. AN OPIATE OF MANY OF THESE A CHANGES ARE IMPORTANT DUE TO. THE PHARMACIST HAVING TO REPORT TO CURES FOR FROM SEVEN DAYS TO ONE WORKING DAY AND REAL TIME TO AGAIN A PREVENT AS MUCH DOCTOR SHOPPING AS POSSIBLE I HAVE. ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SPORT OR RESPECTFULLY ASK RIGHT VOTE. DOT TO KAREN CYBER I'M PRESIDENT OF CALIFORNIA SOCIETY OF ANESTHESIOLOGISTS REPRESENTING THREE TH OVER THREE THOUSAND PHYSICIANS WHO SPECIALIZE IN ANESTHESIOLOGY AND PAIN MEDICINE. IN STRONG SUPPORT OF AB SEVENTEEN FIFTY CHAIR. THIS BILL WILL STRENGTHEN OUR PRESCRIPTION DRUG MONITORING SYSTEM CURIOUS BY ADDING SCHEDULE FIVE CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES CONTAINING OPIOIDS TO THE LIST OF MEDICATIONS THAT TRACKS. THE BILL MAKE SURE THAT THESE SUBSTANCES WHICH INCLUDE COMMON COUGH SUPPRESSANT SYRUPS FOUND IN MANY HOUSEHOLDS IN MEDICINE CABINETS. ARE APPROPRIATELY TRACKED IN THE DATABASE AS THEY TOO CAN PRESENT SUBSTANTIAL RISK OF ABUSE AND DIVERSION. CALIFORNIA POSITIONS WHO SPECIALIZE IN ANESTHESIOLOGY AND PAIN MEDICINE SHARE YOUR COMMITMENT TO PREVENTING FURTHER DEATH AND DISABILITY FROM OPIOID ABUSE IN OUR STATE. THE CURIOUS DATABASE CAN BE VERY HELPFUL TO PHYSICIANS NURSE PRACTITIONERS PHYSICIAN ASSISTANTS PHARMACISTS AND LAW ENFORCEMENT. IN TRACKING THE PRESCRIBING AND DISPENSING OF OPIOID CONTAINING MEDICATIONS. AB SEVENTEEN FIFTY TWO WILL MAKE THIS DATABASE MORE COMPLETE AND MORE ACCURATE. WE'RE STRONGLY COMMITTED TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER LOW AND ALL STAKEHOLDERS TO ENSURE THAT PAIN IS ADEQUATELY TREATED. BUT OAK YARD ABUSE EITHER BY PATIENTS OR BY INDISCRIMINATE PREDICT PRESCRIPTION WRITING MUST BE TRACKED AND OFFENDERS HELD ACCOUNTABLE. TO THAT END WE URGE YOUR AYE VOTE ON AB SEVENTEEN FIFTY TWO. ON THE I'M VIRGINIA HURLED ON WITH THE BOARD OF PHARMACY AND THE BOARD IS THE SPONSOR OF THIS PARTICULAR PIECE OF LEGISLATION. OUGHT THIS BILL WOULD ADD SCHEDULE FIVE WHICH IS TO THE CURE'S REPORTING SYSTEM. ALL. IT IS STILL SCHEDULED FIVE ARE NOT AS OF USABLE AS OUR SCHEDULES TWO THREE AND FOUR WHETHER IT'S ALSO MEDICAL USE. BUT THEY CONTAIN SOME VERY POWERFUL DRUGS INCLUDING PRO METHOD CODING I'M GOING TO MENTION THIS ONE BY ME. IT IS THE CAUSE OF MANY ROBBERIES PARTICULARLY IN THE SACRAMENTO AREA OF PHARMACIES AND ADDITIONALLY THE PRODUCT ITSELF IS EXTRAORDINARILY VALUABLE ON THE STREET. BUT COST THE PHARMACY OR WHAT'S WHAT WHAT'S ONCE CAUGHT COST THE PHARMACY TWELVE DOLLARS A PLATE. GOES FOR TWELVE HUNDRED TO SIXTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS ON THE STREET. THAT THAT CREATES A TREMENDOUS DEMAND FOR THIS PRODUCT IT NEEDS TO BE TRACKED AND TRACED AS PEOPLE COME INTO PRESCRIBERS AND TRY TO GET PRESCRIPTIONS TO COME OUT AND THEN RESELL THE DRUG. ADDITIONALLY ON THE DATA ON REPORTING SYSTEM INTO CHAIRS IT WOULD MOVE IT FROM THE CURRENT SEVEN DAYS IN CALIFORNIA TO WITHIN ONE WORKING DAY. WHICH SOLVES THE PROBLEM WITH A THREE DAY WEEKEND FOR EXAMPLE. AND THAT WAY THE DATA WILL BE AS FRESH AS POSSIBLE FOR PRESCRIBERS INTO SPENCER'S WHEN THEY ACCESS CURES TO IDENTIFY WHERE THE PATIENT IN FRONT OF THEM HAS BEEN. SO. ON BEHALF OF THE BOARD OF PHARMACY WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST DRIVE UP. VETERAN MUST BETWEEN WHAT IS OPPOSITION. MAKE IT OUR ENEMY HAVE THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION WERE ACTUALLY SUPPORT AS AMENDED. I'VE WE THINK THE OTHER FOR WORKING WITH US AND FOR TAKING OUR ONE AMENDMENT FROM THE BEGINNING THAT HAVE TO DO WITH THE BOARD OF PHARMACY IN ADDING. THAT MEDICATIONS TO THE CARES DATABASE BUT WE SUPPORT ALL THE REST OF THE PROVISIONS OF THE BILL AND APPRECIATE THAT IT HAS BEEN AMENDED. TO BE SOMETHING THAT WE REALLY CAN GET BEHIND WE ARE VERY MUCH IN FAVOR OF THE ONE WORKING DAY REPORTING. AS IT HELPS OUR POSITIONS TO ENSURE THAT THERE'S NO LAG TIME BETWEEN WHEN THEY SEE A PATIENT. AND THE SEVEN DAYS PRIOR WHEN THE PATIENT COULD BE GETTING MEDICATIONS IN BETWEEN. SO WE APPRECIATE ALL THE WORK THAT'S BEEN DONE ON THIS AND CONTINUE TO. WANT TO WORK FOR THE CHAIRED BECAUSE THEY'RE GREAT POSITION TOOL THINK. SKINNER PADRES WITNESSES IN THE SUPPORT. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS WHO SHALL MUCH THERAPY AT THE CALIFORNIA STATE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT OF US EMPTY FIFTY TWO AND SEVENTEEN FIFTY ONE THINKING. JENNIFER SUMMERS OF THE MEDICAL BOARD OF CALIFORNIA THE BOARD LIKE TO THANK ASSEMBLYMEMBER LOW OVERTAKING THE BOARDS ARE QUESTION AMENDMENTS AND RENOWNED SUPPORT THANK YOU. JACKIE SAN ON BEHALF OF THE CONSUMER ATTORNEYS OF CALIFORNIA AND THE PATIENT GROUP SHATTERPROOF IN SUPPORT. MISSY JOHNSON WITH THE CUT BACK CALIFORNIA PHARMACISTS ASSOCIATION WITH A LITTLE BIT OF AN IN BETWEEN THERE OUT WE THINK CHAIRMAN LOW FOR HIS LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE WE HAVE THREE RECOMMENDED AMENDMENTS ONE OF WHICH HAS ALREADY BEEN ACCEPTED BY THAT. THE AUTHOR AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU ON THE OTHER TWO ONE RELATES TO THE MAINTENANCE OF THE ICD NINE AND TEN COATS WE'D LIKE FOR THOSE REMAIN IN THERE.

AND VINCENT WORK MODULE WITH ONE GROUP ON BEHALF CALCUTTA WOULD SUPPORT. JERRY CAN WITH CALIFORNIA DENTAL ASSOCIATION WITH THE RECENT AMENDMENTS RENOWNED SUPPORT. NOW WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. BECCA KRAMER MATTER ON BEHALF OF THE ACLU A CALIFORNIA AND WE APPRECIATE THE AMENDMENT THAT pHAS BEEN TAKEN ADDRESS ONE OF OUR CONCERNS. WE STILL ARE CONCERNED ABOUT ADDING SCHEDULE FIVE DRUGS TO CARES PARTICULARLY WITHOUT THE ADDITIONAL PRIVACY PROTECTIONS THAT WE FEEL ARE NEEDED. AND SO AT THIS POINT WE REMAIN OPPOSES. SEVERAL CURRENT AGAIN I ON BEHALF OF ELECTRONIC FRONTIER FOUNDATION AND AND SHARE THE CONCERNS OF IS STILL YOU AND I THINK IT'S IT'S WORTH TAKING A MOMENT JUST TAG TO HAVE A VERY QUICK OVERVIEW OF HOW CALIFORNIA AND FEDERAL PRIVACY LAWS RELATED TO HEALTH INFORMATION WORK. AND THAT IS THAT INFORMATION IS ONLY PROTECTED TO THE EXTENT THAT IT'S UNDER A COVERED ENTITIES TO YOUR HEALTH CARE INFORMATION YOUR MOST PRIVATE INFORMATION REGARDING PRESCRIPTIONS AND DIAGNOSIS. THOSE ARE ONLY PROTECTED UNDER FEDERAL AND STATE STATUTES TO THE EXTENT THAT THEY'RE COMING FROM OR GOING TO A HEALTH CARE PROVIDER OR IN OTHER COVERED ENTITY. ON THE CURIOUS DATABASE IS NOT A COVERED ENTITY AND SO THIS IS WHY WHEN YOU HEAR YOU KNOW THEY SELL YOU ASKING FOR MORE PROTECTION GIVEN SORT OF THE SENSITIVITY OF THIS INFORMATION AND AND. AND US COULD OF BEATING THIS DRAMA OVER OVER THE COURSE OF A FEW YEARS FOR THE NEED FOR PRIVACY IT IS BECAUSE PEOPLE HAVE A PRESUMPTION THAT THIS INFORMATION IS PROTECTED BECAUSE IT IS COMING FROM THEIR HEALTHCARE PROVIDER. BUT IT'S IT'S ONE DEGREE AWAY AND SO IT'S ACTUALLY NOT PROTECTED UNDER THE SAME FEDERAL AND STATE STATUTES THAT FOLKS OTHERWISE I WOULD THINK THAT IT WISE AND SO FOR THOSE REASONS WITHOUT ADDITIONAL PRIVACY PROTECTIONS ON THE EXPANSION OF DATA WE WOULD OPPOSE. THANK YOU. AND WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE COMMITTEE MEMBERS ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS FOR THE CHAIR. SURCHARGE APPLIES REFLECT CLOSE I THANK YOU VERY MUCH I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A VOTE.

REALLY WHAT THIS IS IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU MISTER CARDMEMBERS MAKING ALREADY HAVE THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION. ALSO KNOWN OPPOSE MUST AMENDED POSITION OUR CONCERNS TO CENTER ON THE FACT THAT THIS LETS THE DEPARTMENT ARBITRARILY TAKE THEIR. BASICALLY FAVORITE THREE OF THESE SECURITY PRINTERS AND THEN ABANDONED HARASSED AND WE WOULD ASK THAT THIS INSIGHT BE NARROWED TO LIMIT THE CRITERIA IF THAT'S NECESSARY BUT TO ENSURE. THAT THEY ARE ABLE TO PROTECT I URGE OF TRACK THE PRESCRIPTION PADS. AND YOU SOMETHING THAT'S A LITTLE MORE CONSISTENT IN THEIR. THEIR NARROWING OF THE VENDORS WE ALSO I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS SUPPLY AND THAT THE COSTA DOES NOT SKYROCKET BY NARROWING THE STEP THREE. SO. I WOULD LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING OUR WORK ON THIS AND. WANTED TO RAISE THOSE CONCERNS AND THINK. GOING AGAIN COMMITTEE MEMBERS IN CHAIR MERRYMAKING WITH THE CALIFORNIA DENTAL ASSOCIATION ALSO TAKING AN OPPOSING LESS AMENDED FOR SIMILAR REASONS EITHER WITH OUR COLLEAGUES AT CMA. YOU'D LIKE TO SEE THAT THE BILL FOCUSES MORE ON THE SECURITY MEASURES RATHER THAN THEM ON A VENDOR'S THINK IF. SOON WERE FOR THE WITNESSES TO ANY QUESTIONS WOULD BE MEMBERS. MISTER GRAYSON YES THANK YOU AND THANK YOU TO THE AUTHOR FOR THIS BILL IN FOR YOUR OF PASSION FOR SECURITY. ESPECIALLY WITH THE OPIATE CRISIS THAT WE HAVE. JUST A A VOICE FOR SMALL BUSINESS ESPECIALLY WELL ONE OF THE PRINTERS JUST HAPPENS TO BE. IN MY DISTRICT HAS THERE BEEN ANY KIND OF. RESEARCH DONE AS TO WHAT KIND OF IMPACT THIS WOULD BE ON THE VENDORS ESPECIALLY THE THE FORTY IF I UNDERSTAND IT CORRECTLY. THIRTEEN OF THE VENDORS ARE OUT OF STATE. SO I CAN UNDERSTAND WHY WE WOULD ELIMINATE THAT. BUT THIRTY OF THOSE VENDORS ARE IN STATE. SO I'M ARE THE SMALL MOM AND POP ORDER ARE THE BIGGER AND IT'S NOT REALLY GONNA IMPACT THEM VERY MUCH HAS THERE BEEN SOME RESEARCH DONE ON THAT. YES THAT WE'VE IDENTIFIED UP PARTLY FORTY THREE VENDORS AND THEY ARE ARE GENERALLY SMALL BUSINESSES. SO COMMITTED TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH YOU IN ADDRESSING THOSE CONCERNS OF IT MIGHT BE AN IMPACT OF SMALL BUSINESSES IN MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE. ALSO ADDRESS CONCERNS FROM OPPOSITION ON ENSURING THAT THERE'S A WIDE VARIETY. OF. SMALL BUSINESSES THAT CAN STILL PARTICIPATE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. VETERAN. I THINK YOU AND AND MY COLLEAGUE AS A QUESTION THAT I WAS GONNA ASK AROUND AROUND. IF WE'RE LIMITING IT TO THREE ARE WE SURE THAT THEY'RE GONNA HAVE TO CAPACITY AND AND WHEN IS THERE GOING TO BE A CHECK BACK AS IT WOULD BE A SUNSET ARE GOING TO SEE HOW THIS IS GOING TO WORK OR WE'RE JUST GONNA GO WITH THREE AND. AND GOD BLESS. YET AS I GET SOME REALLY WE WILL MAKE SURE THAT WE. MITIGATE IMPACTS TO. THESE SMALL BUSINESSES IN THE STATE CALIFORNIA AND OTHER WHAT OTHERWISE IN ENSURING THAT WE HAVE A WIDE VARIETY SO WE'RE NOT JUST FOCUS ON JUST ALLOWING A. THE SMALLEST SELECT A FEW OF PARTICIPATE. AND THEN AND I THINK JUST FOR THE RECORD I'D LIKE TO SAY WELL. WE HAVE A LOT OF THESE CURES BILLS OR LOOKING AT A LOT OF THE STUFF THE BIGGEST PART OF THE OPENCARD EPIDEMIC REMAINS WITH IP DRUG USE AND PEOPLE DYING ON THE STREETS. AND SO WE CAN DO STEPPED UP ABOUT DATA PRESCRIPTION ADDICTION IF WE DON'T IF WE DON'T TACKLE HEAD ON THE ISSUE WITH I DO TO DRUG USE THAT WERE NEVER GONNA. GET OUR HANDS AROUND THIS PROBLEM. VETERAN NEWSPAPER THANK YOU AND AND I AGREE WITH BOTH MY COLLEAGUES THAT GOOD COMMENTS IN AND INCLUDING MR GRAYSON. OTHER PRETTY MAYBE IN STATE. SO OFTEN IN THE LEGISLATURE WE DEFINE WHAT A SMALL BUSINESSES BUT ULTIMATELY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE EMPLOYER CONSTITUENTS AND. AND BUSINESSES THAT ARE ALREADY AND QUITE A BIT OF REGULATION IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA REGARDLESS OF THEIR SIZE OF LIKE TO MAKE SURE THEY THEY DO WELL AND CAN TAKE CARE OF THEIR EMPLOYEES AND THOSE WHO NEED THIS. SO I'M RELEASED SUPER STRONGLY ENCOURAGE THAT FINDING A WAY TO REACH A RESOLUTION ON THAT THANK YOU. THE OTHER QUESTIONS. SEEING NONE MISTER CHAIR WAS LIKE CLOSE THANK YOU VERY MUCH I SHARE THAT CONCERN TO AND WHEN THE US AND THE LEGISLATIVE INTENT ABOUT THE ACCOUNTABILITY ATTRACTING SPECIFICALLY FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT.

THOSE CONCERNS AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A VOTE THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHEN ESPECIALLY ON YOUR FIRST. MEETING FOR. MAKING SURE THAT WE RUN SMOOTHLY OF THE CHAIR STILL NOTICES THE ABSENCE OF A QUORUM BY ONE MEMBER SO WELL WE WISH TO BE ACTING AS A SUB COMMITTEE. ABOUT I SEE. ONE ADDITIONAL OFF ON MULTIPLE AUTHORS HERE AND WE ARE GOING IN FILE ORDER SO OUT OF THIS IS FILE AND OUR NUMBER FOR. A ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY EIGHTY SIX BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER GALLAGHER. PLEASE COME AND PRESENT WHATEVER READY AND FOR A POINT OF REFERENCE. MEMBERS WILL BE ABLE TO SPEAK UP TO TWO MINUTES IN SUPPORT AND TWO MINUTES IN OPPOSITION. A SUMMER GALLAGHER PLEASE WHEN EVERYBODY. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN I JUST WANT TO START BY. BY THANKING YOU FOR LEADING A BIPARTISAN COALITION TO ADDRESS. THE OPIOID CRISIS IN OUR STATE AS WE AS WE KNOW IT YOU'VE HELD INFORMATIONAL HEARINGS ON THIS. AND THIS REALLY AFFECTS EVERY PART OF THE STATE AND THE ONE PLACE IS CERTAINLY. AFFECTING VERY DEEPLY IS THE RURAL PARTS CALIFORNIA. SO AB. TWENTY EIGHTY SIX IS YOU KNOW ONE OF. ONE TOOL THAT WE'RE PROPOSING TO HELP. I DEAL WITH THE OPIATE CRISIS AND AND WHAT IT FOCUSES ON IS TRYING TO. CRACK DOWN ON FRAUDULENT. PRESCRIPTIONS BY ALLOWING PRESCRIBERS OF OPIOIDS. MILLION DOCTORS AND OTHERS. TO REVIEW THEIR PRESCRIBING HISTORY AND OUR TO VERIFY THE ACCURACY OF WHAT THAT LIST IS SHOWING HAS WHO THEY'RE PRESCRIBING FOR. UNFORTUNATELY UNDER CURRENT LAW PRESCRIBERS CAN ONLY PULL UP INDIVIDUAL PATIENTS TO CHECK THAT PATIENT'S PRESCRIPTION HISTORY. MANY OTHER STATES AYE WITH PRESCRIPTION DRUG MONITORING PROGRAMS ALLOW PROVIDERS TO VIEW ALL OF THE PATIENTS. WHO ARE LISTED WITH THAT PRESCRIBER? SO AB TWENTY EIGHTY SIX INSURERS A PRESCRIBERS IN CALIFORNIA CAN DO SO AS WELL. BY ALLOWING THE PRESCRIBED ACCESS SECURES DATABASE FOR A LIST OF PATIENTS FOR WHOM THEY ARE LISTED. AS A PRESCRIBED HER. ALLOWING REVIEW PRESCRIPTION HISTORY TO VERIFY ACCURACY WILL HELP PRESCRIBERS FLAG AND REPORT SUSPICIOUS PRESCRIPTIONS THAT THEY MAY NOT HAVE ACTUALLY. OF WRITTEN THERE'S BEEN CASES ACTUALLY WEAR PRESCRIPTION PADS HAVE BEEN STOLEN FROM OFFICES AND THEN. THAT PEOPLE USE US TO WRITE FRAUDULENT PRESCRIPTIONS AND AND THEY ARE ABLE TO GO AND GET ACCESS TO MORE OPIOIDS WENT THEN THE OTHERWISE. THAT WOULD BE ABLE TO. AND AND AS I SAID YOU KNOW THIS IS GONNA BE A MULTI PRONGED APPROACH. TO TACKLE THIS ISSUE. TREATMENT. YOU KNOW IT CRACKING DOWN ON FRAUD AND PRESCRIPTIONS. ENSURING THAT WE HAVE YOU KNOW SOME. SOME BETTER CONTROLS ON ON HOW THIS IS GETTING OUT INTO THE. THE COMMUNITY ALL THOSE THINGS SEEM TO BE DONE. BUT THIS IS ONE OF THOSE TOOLS AND I WOULD ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE ON AB TWENTY EIGHTY SIX THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH IT DID KNOW ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT.

ESPECIALLY AS AMENDED TO ALLOW THE POSITION TO CHECK THEIR OWN RECORD AS OPPOSED TO HAVING TO ASK THE DEPARTMENT FOR THEIR PRESCRIBING RECORD. AS IN THE EXAMPLE THAT MR GALLAGHER AND NOTED. THIS IS AN ISSUE WHERE PHYSICIANS HAVE NO WAY OF SEEING. WHAT THEY'RE WHOSE NAME OR I'M SORRY? WHOSE HISTORY THEIR NAME COMES UP UNDER UNLESS THEY KNOW THAT THAT PATIENT SPECIFICALLY HAS SEEN THEM AND BEEN PRESCRIBED FROM THEM SO. I'M WE THINK THAT THIS WILL JUST. REALLY ALLOW POSITIONS TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYTHING IS ACCURATE. AND WILL HELP IN YOU'LL ISN'T YOUR SYSTEM TO ITS FULLEST IN ORDER SUPPORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. DODD KAREN CYBER PRESIDENT THE CALIFORNIA SOCIETY OF ANESTHESIOLOGISTS AND STRONG SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY EIGHTY SIX WILL MAKE THE DATA EASIER TO ACCESS AND MORE RELIABLE FOR PHYSICIANS AND OTHER.

CLASS BUT FIVE WEEKS INTO THE START OF THAT HIGH SCHOOL YEAR SHE WAS REAR ENDED BY DISTRACTED DRIVER. TIFFANY BROKER KNACK WAS PUT INTO A HALO DEVICE Y. SCREWS IN HER HEAD. AND SHE WAS HOME SCHOOLED FOR THE REST OF THE SCHOOL YEAR. SHE WAS PRESCRIBED POWERFUL OPIOIDS AND OTHER MEDICATIONS TO HELP HER SLEEP AND HANDLE HURRYING SOCIETY. THIS IS WHAT LINDA WRITES I WAS NAIVE ABOUT PAIN MEDICATIONS AND HAD NO IDEA THAT THEY COULD BECOME ADDICTIVE. PARTICULARLY TO A BRAIN THAT WAS STILL DEVELOPING. TIFFANY WAS IN A LOT OF PAIN AND I TRUSTED HER DOCTORS TO MONITOR THE AMOUNT OF PILLS SHE WAS TAKING. SOMETIMES THOSE SHE HAD A BOTTLE OF NINETY PILLS FOR WHEN PRESCRIPTION AND THEN HAD ANOTHER FROM A DIFFERENT DOCTOR. BY COULD IN NORCO WITH THE NAMES OF TWO OF HER MOST COMMON PRESCRIPTIONS. ONE TIME WE HAD TO TAKE TIFFANY TO THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT SHE WAS SO SICK AND DISORIENTED THEY USE THE WORD OVERDOSED A WORD I ASSOCIATED ONLY WITH DEATH. THEY TOLD ME THAT SHE WAS PROBABLY ADDICTED TO HER PAIN PILLS. IN LESS THAN FIVE HOURS AFTER SHE WAS STABLE THEY CENTER HOME. I WAS IN SHOCK I THOUGHT THEY WOULD KEEP IT THERE UNTIL SHE GOT WELL REALLY WELL. I WANTED MORE INFORMATION BUT THEY DIDN'T HAVE ANY INFORMATION TO GIVE ME EXCEPT. THEY ADVISED ME TO GO LOOK ON THE INTERNET. AT ANOTHER VISIT TO THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT A DOCTOR TOLD US TO TELL TIFFANY TO. FLUSH ALL THOSE PILLS DOWN THE TOILET OR SHE WAS GOING TO END UP IN A BODY BAG. STILL NO INFORMATION WAS GIVEN ON WHERE WE CAN GO FOR HELP. IT DIDN'T SEEM LIKE ANYONE CARED I WANTED TO HELP HER BUT DIDN'T KNOW HOW JUST TAKING THE PILLS AWAY FROM HER DIDN'T SOLVE THE ADDICTION PROBLEM. LATER ON TIFFANY GOT A JOB AND MOVED INTO HER OWN APARTMENT PREDICTION GOT WORSE SHE NOW HAD MORE THAN ONE DOCTOR SHE WAS DOCTOR SHOPPING IN SHE WAS PHARMACY SHOPPING. HER NEW DOCTOR STARTED HER ON ANOTHER PAIN MEDICATION ONE THAT REQUIRED FEWER PILLS IN A DAY HE TOLD HER ABOUT IT IT WAS CALLED OXYCONTIN. HE SAID THAT NOW SHOULD ONLY HAVE TO TAKE ONE PILL IN THE MORNING IN ONE IN THE EVENING. THIS LATER JUMPED SHIP THREE OR FOUR IN THE MORNING WITH THE SAME AMOUNT IN THE EVENING. PREDICTION EVENTUALLY LEAD TO MORE AND MORE E. R. VISITS FIVE DETOX IS CHIU UNCOMPLETED TREATMENT PROGRAMS A DUI LIVER FAILURE AND LASTLY HER DEATH. THE SEEDS OF ADDICTION WERE PLANTED IN TIFFANY'S PLASTIC DEVELOPING BRAIN WHEN DOCTORS PRESCRIBE POWERFUL OP WHICH TO A MINOR. SHE WAS IS SENIOR IN HIGH SCHOOL WHEN THAT BEGAN. HER PARENTS WERE KEPT IN THE DARK AND RENDERED HELPLESS AND AS MORE AND MORE DOCTORS. PRESCRIBE MORE AND MORE POWERFUL APPEAL RIGHTS TIFFANY NO WELL CHAPMAN DIED AT THE AGE OF TWENTY SEVEN. WE NEED TO PASS A BE TWO SEVEN FOUR ONE TO STOP ADDICTION BEFORE IT STARTS. TIFFANY WAS JUST TWENTY SEVEN WHEN SHE DIED AND IT COULD HAVE BEEN PREVENTED. THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR TAX MONEY WERE ALSO I FEEL LOST AND EACH ONE OF US HAVE FAR TOO MANY STORIES LIKE THAT IN DISTRICT TO REPRESENT. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. TO HEAR. GOOD MORNING. CHAIRMAN LOW IN MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME MY NAME IS VALERIE LEVEL A LOT. AND AYE AMERICA'S BRING HOPE YOU IN THAT IT. MY STORY BEGINS THE DAY AFTER CHRISTMAS ON DECEMBER TWENTY SIXTH OF TWO THOUSAND TWELVE I WAS DRIVING I WAS ON MY WAY TO PICK MY SISTER UP. I DIDN'T KNOW IT THEN BUT ON THAT DAY MY LIFE WOULD CHANGE FOREVER. AS THEY DROVE THROUGH THE INTERSECTION A CARD TO MY RIGHT HAD RAN A RED LIGHT AND HIT MY CAR AT APPROXIMATELY FORTY FIVE MILES AN HOUR. MY CAR SWERVED ONTO ONCOMING TRAFFIC BEFORE COMING TO A COMPLETE STOP MY DAD QUICKLY ARRIVED AT THE SCENE AND DROVE ME TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM FOR THE NEXT TWO AND A HALF YEARS STRAIGHT I WAS PRESCRIBED COPIOUS AMOUNTS OF HYDROCODONE OXYCONTIN. NINETY TO HUNDRED TWENTY TABLETS WEEKLY TO BE EXACT. I HAD SEVERAL MONTHS OF SEVERE BACK AND NECK PAIN BUT NO BROKEN BONES. DOCTOR WHO WAS PRESCRIBING THE MEDICATION SO I MADE THE MISTAKE OF DEEMING IT OKAY AND SAVE. IT ONLY TOOK A FEW DAYS AND A FEW TABLETS BEFORE THE DISEASE CONSUMED MY ENTIRE LIFE PARALYZING ME UNTIL I COULD TAKE MY NEXT DOSE. AFTER TWO AND A HALF YEARS OF THE CYCLE OF PHARMACISTS FLIGHT MY PRESCRIPTION STATING THAT IT WAS SUSPICIOUS HOW QUICKLY I WOULD GO THROUGH THE REFILLS. MY DOCTOR WAS NOTIFIED AND I WAS CUT OFF FROM FEATURE OPIATE PRESCRIPTIONS. UNFORTUNATELY BY THIS TIME I WAS ALREADY HEAVILY ADDICTED AND NOW WAS LEFT TO GO INTO WITHDRAWAL ELEVEN WITHOUT ANY HELP OR SUPPORT OR EDUCATION FROM THE VERY DOCTOR THAT PRESCRIBED AND TO ME. I FELT ALONE SCARED ANGRY AND ASHAMED I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WHAT WITHDRAWAL WHAT'S BUT I LEARNED. IN FACT THE FEAR OF GOING INTO WITHDRAWAL IS WHAT CAN I ADDITIONAL LIFE FOR OVER FOUR YEARS MY LIFE QUICKLY BECAME ALL ABOUT CHASING MY NEXT TYPE BECAUSE IT WAS THE ONLY THING THAT KEPT ME FROM GOING INTO WITHDRAWAL. I ISOLATED MYSELF FROM MY FRIENDS AND MY FAMILY BECAUSE I WAS ASHAMED OF WHAT I WAS DOING AND I WAS AFRAID OF SOMEBODY FINDING OUT. I FOUND MYSELF IN THIS NEVER ENDING CYCLE OF CONSTANTLY BEING IN FIGHTER FLIGHT MODE. I DID THINGS I NEVER THOUGHT I WOULD I LIED I STOLE A BECAME SOMEONE I NO LONGER RECOGNIZED I HAD GIVEN. I HAD GIVEN UP. I DID THINGS I NEVER THOUGHT I WOULD DO I DID THAT. I BECAME SOMEONE I NO LONGER RECOGNIZE I'D GIVEN UP ON LIFE AND HAD TRULY ACCEPTED THAT I WOULD DIE YOUNG. I SPENT MANY NIGHTS SETTING MULTIPLE ALARMS TO TRY TO STAY AWAKE BECAUSE I KNEW THERE WAS A POSSIBILITY THAT I WOULDN'T WAKE BACK UP. I LOST MY MORALS MY HEALTH MY SELF ESTEEM. AND MY HOPE AND MY HAPPINESS BUT MOSTLY I LOST MY WILL TO LIVE. I WENT FROM A CARING VIVACIOUS AND SOCIAL PERSON THAT NEVER DID DRUGS IN THE PAST. TO BEING A FULL BLOWN OPIOID ADDICT AT ONLY TWENTY THREE YEARS OLD. IF I KNEW THAT WHAT I KNOW NOW I WOULD HAVE APPROACHED MY INJURY AND TREATMENT MUCH DIFFERENTLY. TODAY AS I STAND HERE BEFORE YOU I'M EXACTLY TWO YEARS AND FOUR MONTHS OVER. IT IS WITH THE HELP OF MY ADDICTION THERAPIST CURTIS BUT SANSKI MY NEW PHYSICIAN DR ERIC TUPPER MY FAMILY AND MY FRIENDS THAT I'M ALIVE TODAY. BUT THE BATTLE IS FAR FROM OVER IT WILL NEVER BE OVER. EVERYDAY THAT I WAKEUP I MAKE THE CHOICE TO FIGHT FOR MY SOBRIETY MY LIFE WILL NEVER BE WHAT IT WAS BEFORE ADDICTION. I CONSIDER MYSELF ONE OF THE LUCKY ONES BECAUSE I LIVED TO TELL MY STORY BUT I'LL CONTINUE TO FIGHT FOR THE MILLIONS OF LIVES THAT WERE CUT SHORT AND FOR THE MILLION MORE LIVES THAT WILL BE CUT SHORT IN THE FUTURE. I'M HERE BECAUSE I'M ASKING FOR CHANGE. ASSEMBLY BILL TWO SEVEN FOUR ONE IS A GREAT STEP TOWARDS PROTECTING MINORS FROM OPIOID ADDICTION AND ENSURING THAT BOTH THE PATIENT AND PARENTS ARE FULLY EDUCATED ON THE RISKS AND DANGERS OF OPIOIDS. I THINK ASSEMBLY MEMBER BURKE FOR BRINGING THE BILL FORWARD AND ASKED THE COMMITTEE TO VOTE YES ON AB TWO SEVEN FOUR ONE THINKING OF. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR SHARING YOUR STORY WITH US OTHER ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. KATHY HALL ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE PARENT TEACHERS ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT. SHERRI MCKEE REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE IN SUPPORT. CHRIS READ UP THERE IN CALIFORNIA PHYSICAL THERAPY ASSOCIATION WEREN'T SUPPORT LOOK FOR TO FUTURE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE AUTHOR. RUN THE INCLUSION OF ON. INFORMATION REGARDING AND NON. NON PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS. AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO PAIN MANAGEMENT. MAYBE CANNOT THE CALIFORNIA DENTAL ASSOCIATION WHERE IN A SUPPORTIVE AMENDED POSITION I WILL AFFORD TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH AUTHORS OFFICE TO HAVE AMENDMENTS THAT WOULD INCLUDE. OTHER REGULATORY BOARDS THAT WOULD BE ABLE TO CREATE THE INFORMED CONSENT FORMS THANK YOU. JOHN WINGER ON BEHALF OF GATEKEEPER INNOVATION IN SUPPORT. RAND MARTIN ON BEHALF OF THE AIDS HEALTHCARE FOUNDATION WOULD LIKE TO ADD OUR SUPPORT OF THIS BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU TO SHOW WITNESSES AND SUPPORT SEEN NONE OF THE WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION THE MORNING WAS RICHARD MEMBERS MAKE AN ALREADY BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL MEDICAL ASSOCIATION IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL. I'M A WHILE WE ARE DEFINITELY SYMPATHETIC TO. THE AUTHOR'S INTENT WITH THIS AND SHARE THE SAME GOALS OF ENSURING SAFETY IN FOR CHILDREN WHO ARE PRESCRIBED OPIOIDS I'M OR MINORS ARE PRESCRIBED OPIOIDS. I'M WE HAVE SOME VERY SAD. VERY SERIOUS CONCERN ABOUT THE WAY THAT IT'S WRITTEN. SPECIFICALLY THE SPELL DRAWS A HARD LINER FIVE DAYS FOR PRESCRIPTION REGARDLESS OF SPECIFIC PATIENTS AT NEEDS ARE UNIQUE CHARACTERISTICS. SUCH AS PROXIMITY TO THE DOCTOR ACCESS TO APPOINTMENTS. AND ANYTHING ELSE THAT SPECIFICALLY RELATES TO THAT PATIENT AND WE THINK THAT TIME. FLEXIBILITY IS NEEDED AND THAT'S WHY THESE ARE POSITION DECISIONS THAT THEY'RE MADE IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE PATIENT. IT ALSO PRESCRIBES I INFORMED CONSENT LANGUAGE OR WHAT NEEDS TO BE INCLUDED IN THIS CONVERSATION WE FEEL LIKE THAT'S ACTUALLY DANGEROUS PRECEDENT ASIDE. BECAUSE THIS NEEDS TO BE PATIENT SPECIFIC AND THE POSITION NEEDS TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS. ALL THE THINGS THAT ARE RELEVANT TO THAT PATIENT THE OTHER MEDICATIONS THEY MIGHT BE TAKING. BUT SETTING A STANDARD FOR WHAT EXACTLY HAS TO BE IN THAT CONVERSATION PLAN WE WOULD SAY THAT THAT IS. I UNNECESSARY AND THAT INFORMED CONSENT OF ALL THE RISKS AND DANGERS TO SOMETHING THAT POSITIONS ARE ALREADY TESTED YOU. BUT IT ALSO REQUIRES SIGNED PARENTAL CONSENT FOR MINOR FOR MEDICAL PROCEDURE WHICH WE THINGS. UP FINISH THE SAID SAY DANGER FOR CITING GOING FORWARD BUT. WE LOOK FORWARD TO HOME TO WORKING ON THIS AND TO ADDRESSING THIS ISSUE. AND WOOD. I SWEAR OPPOSITION ON THE BILL AS IT IS IN PRINT THINKING. THANK YOU ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE BRAVE TO COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR THEIR ANY. SOMEONE THEY CAN THANK YOU M. FIRST I'D LIKE TO THINK THAT WITNESSES WHO CAME AND TESTIFIED. ON BEHALF OF THE PARENT WHO LOST A CHILD AND ALSO THEM. AS OUR WITNESS YOU SHARED WITH US PROBABLY ONE OF THE MOST COGENT AND MEANINGFUL EXPLANATIONS OF WHAT OPIOIDS CAN DO YOU. THANK YOU FOR BEING STRONG KEEP IT UP AND. IT IS A REMINDER TO US THE WORK THAT WE NEED TO DO IN OUR STATE TO BE SUPPORTIVE OF YOU AND PREVENT THAT FROM HAPPENING AGAIN. SO VERY IMPRESSED BY IT. TO THE QUESTIONS OF THE OPPOSITION REYES ACTUALLY THINK I HAVE A QUESTION FOR HIM SEEM IS REPRESENTED. ON THE INFORMED CONSENT QUESTION. THERE'S NOTHING IN THE BILL THAT PREVENTS THE DOCTOR FROM GIVING ALL THE CONSENT THAT YOU JUST MENTIONED. IS THAT CORRECT WHEN THEY COULD STILL DO ALL THAT YOU JUST SAID UNDER THE SPELL. LIST THAT'S HOW I READ IT MAYBE I SHOULD ASK THE AUTHOR YES YES YES IT DOES AND WHAT THEY CAN SAN ACTUALLY THE PURPOSE FOR IT IS BECAUSE IT ALSO WERE ADDING TO WHAT THEY'VE ARI. THE OPEN SPAN OF WHAT THEY CAN ALREADY ASK YOU CAN CONTINUE TO DO THEIR JOB THE WAY THEY'VE BEEN DOING THAT PORTION WE JUST ALSO ARE ASKING THAT THEY ASK IF THERE HAS BEEN PASSED USE OR PAST ABUSE APPARENTLY. HELPFUL SO AND IT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOT. CITY LOW BAR FOR WHAT IS INFORMED CONSENT AND I MAKE SURE THAT THE PHYSICIANS DON'T HAVE THEIR HANDS TIED THAT'S ALL THE CADENCE THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT. AND THEN WITH RESPECT TO ACCESS ANY IDEAS THAT MISTER DALI IS A CO AUTHOR OF THIS BILL REPRESENTS A FAIRLY RURAL PART OF THE STATE. AND SO I I FIND THAT. NO WORTHY BUT ADD TO THAT POINT HAVE THOSE WHO CANNOT EASILY GET TO EIGHT PHYSICALLY TO A PHYSICIAN. SO NOT THE CASE YOU CAN OFTEN CALL YOUR PHYSICIAN OR OTHERWISE WOULD WITH ANYTHING STOP THAT SUPERMARKET BECAUSE OF THE SCHEDULE OF DRUG YOU CAN CALL IN CAN YOU CAN'T CALLING HOWEVER I WILL BE SUPER CLEAR THAT THAT. THE BILL DOES ALLOW DOCTORS TO PRESCRIBE MORE THAN FIVE DAYS IF THEY FELT IT WAS MEDICALLY NECESSARY SO LONG AS IT IS NOTED. IN THE MEDICAL RECORD. BECAUSE THEY CAN'T IF IT IS MEDICALLY NECESSARY GOT OKAY I'M THINK YOU KNOW I REALLY THE STATUS WHEN CAREFULLY BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO BE OVERLY RIGID. BUT AS YOU KNOW PARENTS HAVE TO FOURTEEN YEAR OLDS I AM TERRIFIED AT THE PROSPECT THAT SOMETHING LIKE THIS COULD HAPPEN TO THEM OBVIOUSLY THE INJURY TO BEGIN WITH BUT THEN THE ADDITIONAL LIFELONG FAX. SO I AM PLEASED TO SUPPORT YOUR BILL THINKING. THANK YOU SOMEONE BAKER ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. BUT MR BLUE. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPOSITION. I THINK THE CAN YOU EXPLAIN JUST ON THAT NARROW POINT OF THE. FIVE DAYS IF THERE'S. A AN ALLOWANCE FOR DOCTOR TO. PLACED IN THE RECORD A NOTATION THAT WHICH YOU WOULD THINK WOULD BE IN THE RECORD ANYWAY THAT IT'S MEDICALLY NECESSARY TO GO BEYOND FIVE DAYS. WISER PROBLEM JUST ON THAT SPECIFIC PROVISION. I THINK SPECIFIC TO THAT THE OPPOSITION AT. IS TO THE POINT OF. PUTTING THE PROVIDER IN A PLACE OF LIABILITY BECAUSE IT ASSUMES THAT FIVE DAYS IS THE MAX THAT IS ACTUALLY NECESSARY. AND THAT GOING ABOVE THAT WOULD BE EXCESSIVE OR REQUIRES A SPECIFIC EXPLANATION OF WHY THEY MIGHT NEED TO GO ABOVE THAT. AND IT. IT'S. LIKE I SAID IT'S ASSUMING THAT FIVE DAYS WOULD BE THE MAX THE COULD EVER BE NECESSARY AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IS SO PATIENT SPECIFIC. AND SHOULD NOT BE WRITTEN INTO STATUE OF BECAUSE IT IS NOT. THERE IS NO BRIGHT LINE THAT WE CAN DRIVE WHAT NUMBER OF DAYS IS SPECIFIC TO EVERY SINGLE PATIENT AND WILL ALWAYS BE SUFFICIENT. AND SO CUTTING IT OFF OF FIVE DAYS MINCING AFTER THAT YOU HAVE TO DEFEND YOURSELF WE THINK IS REALLY LEGISLATING THE PRACTICE OF MEDICINE. AND I'M. AND REALLY IT'S JUST NOT APPROPRIATE. AND DOES NOT HAVE ANY DATA TO SUPPORT THAT THAT WILL BE APPROPRIATE FOR EVERY SINGLE PATIENT EVERY TIME. IF THEY THE CHAIR I COULD RESPOND ABSOLUTE I DOES THIS EDC ACTUALLY DOES GIVE A RECOMMENDATION AND IT IS THREE DAYS SO WE HAVE WE HAVE TAKEN THAT INTO ACCOUNT ALSO IF IT WEREN'T. NECESSARY WE WOULDN'T ALL BE HERE. IF WAS A NECESSARY TO MAKE THEM SOME HARD AND FAST DECISIONS WE REALLY WOULDN'T BE STANDING HERE TALKING ABOUT THIS AND QUITE FRANKLY. ANY RECOMMENDATIONS THAT COME THROUGH THE MOUTH OR TAKE TEN YEARS FROM THE RECOMMENDATIONS BECOME COMMON PRACTICE AND THIS EPIDEMIC HAS NINETY ONE DEATHS EACH DAY FORTY TWO OF THEM ARE FROM PRESCRIBE OPIATES. JUDICIAL MEMBERS WISHING SPEAK. I COULD JUST CALL MAYBE ASK A QUESTION OPPOSITION SO IT IS. OBVIOUSLY A LOT OF US ARE TRYING TO APPROACH THIS FROM DIFFERENT ANGLES AND. THERE'S BEEN A QUESTION BAILEY AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL ABOUT WHETHER THE THIRTY DAY PRESCRIPTION IS OBSOLETE AND DISCUSSIONS AROUND THAT. AND THEN YOU INVOLVED A STEP THERAPY WHERE. SOMETIMES HEALTH INSURANCE PLANS WILL SAY YOU NEED TO TRY THIS FIRST THE SECOND IN A PHYSICIAN WILL GET DOWN TO WHERE MAYBE I DON'T FOR. A IS BEST TO DECIDE EFFECTS AND THINGS LIKE THAT IS THERE ANY DISCUSSION WITHIN YOUR COMMUNITY. OF BEING INVOLVED WHETHER THE THIRD BECAUSE IN MY VIEW. YOU KNOW I KNOW WE ALL WORRY ABOUT THE COST OF HEALTH CARE BUT. WHAT'S THE HARM IN IN ISSUING FIVE DAYS IN SAYING. LET ME CALL YOU FOR FOLLOW UP YOU HAVE ANY SIDE EFFECTS MAY BE. A DIFFERENT DRUG IS REQUIRED OR ARE HIS. ARE YOU WORKING ON ANY OF THESE ISSUES ARE IS ANY. INFORMATION TO KIND OF CHANGE WHAT'S GOING ON. YES ACTUALLY THERE HAVE BEEN GREAT CHANGES THAT POSITIONS HAVE MADE IMPROVE PRESCRIBERS OF MAINE. I'M OVER THE YEARS IN THEIR PRESCRIBING PRACTICES WE'VE SEEN TWO YEARS AWARE CALIFORNIA'S ONE OF ONLY A FEW STATES THAT HAS NOT HAD. AN INCREASE IN OVERDOSE DEATHS WE'VE BEEN CONSISTENTLY. I'M DOWN TRENDING WE HAVE SOME OF THE LOWEST PER CAPITA I'VE OPIOID PRESCRIPTION PRESCRIBING. AND. SO WE WOULD ARGUE THAT THE POSITIONS ARE TAKING THIS VERY SERIOUSLY AND HAVE CHANGED THEIR PRESCRIBING PRACTICES HAVE STARTED WORKING WITH. YOU KNOW LET'S TRY OTHER MEDICATIONS FIRST AND SEE IF THIS IS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY WHEN BEFORE. THEY MAY HAVE GONE STRAIGHT TO HAVE A STRONGER MEDICATION BECAUSE YOU KNOW FOR YERS THEY'VE BEEN TASKED WITH MAKING FOR THEY APPROPRIATELY TREAT PAIN AND DO NOT UNDER TREAT PAIN. SO COMING BACK FROM THAT AS THERE'S BEEN A LOT THAT HAS BEEN DONE ON THE THE PROVIDER COMMUNITY OR BY THE PROVIDER COMMUNITY. AND SO WE WOULD ASK THAT WE ARE ALLOWED. CONTINUED DOING THAT AS AND MAKING THOSE DIFFERENT CHANGES AND CONTINUE SEEING IT AND THE DATA AS IT'S REPORTED. I'M. AND SO SETTING SOMETHING LIKE A. IT'S JUST SOLID MIND AS TO WHERE YOU CAN PRESCRIBE AND WHAT'S APPROPRIATE. WE CONTINUE TO MAINTAIN ITS JUST NOT THE WAY TO GET THERE AND IT'S NOT SPECIFIC TO EVERY PATIENT. THAT. THEY DON'T ALWAYS HAVE ACCESS TO BE ABLE TO CALL THEIR POSITION AND. YOU KNOW I FIVE DAYS AND SAY CAN MAKE MEN THIS ISN'T WORKING FOR ME I THINK IN AN IDEAL SITUATION THAT WOULD BE GREAT BUT I DON'T THINK THAT EVERY PATIENT HAS THAT WITH THEIR PHYSICIAN. AND SO. IT'S THOSE KINDS OF SITUATIONS WHERE. YOU KNOW WE CAN'T DETERMINE EVERYTHING THAT IS GOING TO FOLLOW PATIENTS AND WE CAN'T JUST SAY THAT. THE BEST KNOW BEST CASE SCENARIO LIKE THAT. IS THE WAY TO TREAT IT BECAUSE THERE WILL BE PATIENTS THAT WILL DEFINITELY HAVE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES IF I END AND YOU GUYS ARE DIFFICULT POSITIONS BECAUSE WE PLATFORM SO THAT. WHERE DOCTORS? YOU KNOW. TOLD THE AUDIENCE THAT IN THE NINETIES WE WERE MANDATED TO TREAT PAIN AND IF WE DON'T TREAT PAYING WE WILL GET A BAD RECOMMENDATION FROM PATIENTS. AND. SO I KNOW YOU GUYS ARE WORKING ON IT MY OWN PERSONAL SITUATION WAS. BUT MY DAUGHTER FELL OFF BARS AT GYMNASTICS FRACTURED A WILL HAVE A SCOOP PUT AN A CHOCK. AND WHEN SHE WOKE UP SHALL DISCOMFORT YOU KNOW WE'RE THINKING CHILDREN'S TYLENOL THE ONLY THING A NURSE COULD GIVE HER AN EIGHT YEAR OLD MORPHINE. AND UP SO OBVIOUSLY WE TURNED THAT DOWN. THAT MORPHINE IS SOMETHING YOU GET FAR HOSPICE PATIENTS AND. DYING SOLDIERS ON THE BATTLEFIELD SO I THOUGHT THAT WAS A LITTLE. AND I'D NEVER RESEARCH IT TO FIND OUT IF THAT WAS AN INSURANCE STEAL OUR OR. OR WHAT BUT IT'S A SINGLE LITTLE EXCESSIVE TO ME BUT. IF YOU SEE THE BILLS ARE COMING UP TODAY THE CURSED AT A PACE CROSS CITY LINES THE DATABASES ONE IS PERHAPS TRYING TO DO WHAT MR GALLAGHER STRANDED. THERE'S A LOT THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS WE NEED TO WORK ON AND. SO. THOSE ARE JUST SOME OF MY THOUGHTS. ON ANY OTHER MEMBERS MISSION SPEAK SING NON RECIPROCAL ELECT CLOSE. YES AND I THINK YOU MISTER CHAIR I I DON'T THINK THE CONCEPT OF PRESCRIPTION LIMITS LATELY HOWEVER I BELIEVE THERE ARE SOME CRIMES REQUIRE SAFETY AND EXCEPTIONAL LEGISLATIVE RESPONSE. I THINK TO SAY THAT FIVE DAYS CREATES LIABILITIES FOR DOCTORS. IT. AND QUITE FRANKLY IT'S A COP OUT LOCK SOMEONE HAS TO BE RESPONSIBLE WHEN THEY PRESCRIBE A CHILD AN OPIOID. AND IT IS MY AND PEOPLE TRUST LIKE VALERIE SAID SHE TRUSTED HER DOCTOR AND NOW PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA NEED TO TRUST US. WE DON'T HAVE THE LUXURY TO WAIT TEN YEARS FOR A PROCESS THAT FOR FOR DOCTORS TO CATCH UP. WE'VE WAITED LONG ENOUGH I WANNA THINK VALERIA MRS KING FOR THEIR TIME TODAY AND THEY'RE HONEST ON THEIR HONEST A. THERE OUGHT THEIR HONEST TESTIMONY. AND I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN ITEM THANK YOU BUT WE'RE SO SUBCOMMITTEE SO WHEN WE BECOME QUORUM WILL TAKE THAT UP. NEXT UP WE HAVE FILE ITEM FIFTEEN AB TWO FIVE FIVE FIVE MISTER COOLEY SCHIAVONE KNOW MISTER VICE CHAIR THANK YOU. PLEASURE TO BE WITH YOU. I'M HERE TODAY TO PRESENT AB TWENTY FIVE FIFTY FIVE CONCERNING CANNABIS PLANT TAGGING. AND I DIFFERENT ONE I THINK. MISTER FROM JUNE FOR THE ANALYSIS OF THIS PRESENT TO YOU TODAY OR. FOLIO. UNDER THE M. SIERRA SAY AND PROP SIXTY FOUR NOW COLLECTIVELY KNOWN AS. THE CURSE OUT. ALL COMMERCIAL CANNABIS IS REQUIRED TO BE IN A TRACK AND TRACE PROGRAM. THAT FOLLOWS THE PRODUCT FROM ITS INITIAL CULTIVATION TO ITS EVENTUAL SALE. I AS IT IS NOW BEEN. WORKING ON IMPLEMENTATION OF THE CALIFORNIA PART OF FOOD NEVER CULTURE. OF PLANTS ARE NOT REQUIRED TO BE ISSUED A UNIQUE IDENTIFIER OR PLANT TAG. UNLESS THE PLANT IS DEEMED MATURE. WHICH HAVE DEFINED TO ME THE CANNABIS PLANT THAT IS FLOWERING. AS A PRACTICAL MATTER I THINK FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT THAT STARTS PRESENT ANY SOME COMPLEXITY. AS YOU START SEEING PLANTS GROWN A CONSUMABLE SCALE IN LARGE WAREHOUSE FACILITIES. TWENTY DEFY WHICH PLANTS ARE ACTUALLY MATURE FEAR FLOWERING. INVOLVES A LOT OF. DILIGENT INSPECTION IN ORDER TO CHARACTERIZE WHAT'S IN THAT WAREHOUSE. AND SORT SHIP SOME BIRD NOT A LAW ENFORCEMENT AND THE EXPERIENCE OF OTHER STATES IS THAT'S NOT ACTUALLY THE ONLY SOLUTION AVAILABLE. WE ARE NOT THE FIRST PERSON TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT FOR STATE FOR THIS SOUND. CANNABIS GROW CYCLES CAN BE NATURAL VIA OUTDOOR SUNLIGHT. THEY CAN BE MANUFACTURED. USING MIX SLIDER INDOOR LIGHT CYCLES. KEEP PLANTS IN A VEGETATIVE NON FLOWERING STATE. A. WITH THE ABILITY DEMOING DECIDE IT'S TIME TO GET A PICTURE AND FLORA YOU CAN SPEED IT UP. BY STEPS THAT THE GORE WILL TAKE. THE AMOUNT OF PLANTS ALLOWED TO BE CULTIVATED IS CURRENTLY DEPENDENT ON THE TYPE OF LICENSE ISSUED THE AMOUNT OF CANOPY SIZE. OF EACH LICENSE ISSUED. ARE. UNDER THE CURRENT REGULATIONS ONLY MATURE PLANTS ARE COUNTED TOWARD THE CANOPY SIZE HE'S FOR HAVE TO DIFFERENTIATE WHAT'S FLOUR AND WHAT'S NOT. THIS CREATES A PROBLEM FOR LOCAL AGENCIES AS WELL AS LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT SORTS A LOGISTICS ISSUE. A BECAUSE THEY NEED TO SEEK TO ENSURE THAT CANNABIS BUSINESS ARMENIAN ALL THE LEGAL CULTIVATION ACQUIREMENT. INCLUDING HAVING PLANTS PROPERTY TAG OF TO SHOULD BE PLUGGED UNDER THE TAG OF THE REGULATION. AND HAVING THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF PLANTS WITHIN THE ALLOWED CANOPY SIZE FOR THE GIVEN LICENSE. WHEN WHEN LAW ENFORCEMENT HAS TO DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN FLOWERING AND NON FAR IMPLANTS WITHIN A GIVEN FACILITY WHICH MAY BE. A VERY CONSIDERABLE SIZE EXPANSE. YOU CAN'T REALLY SIZE IT UP THAT READILY. ARE. WHERE YOU MAY HAVE HUNDREDS OF PLANTS PER ROOM TIGHTLY PLACE TOGETHER? IN OTHER STATES SUCH AS COLORADO WASH IMPLANTS ARE EASILY IDENTIFIED BY ME AS MATURE PLANTS BY A HEIGHT REQUIREMENT. SOMETIMES EIGHT INCHES CAN BE GOING AS HIGH AS TWENTY FOUR INCHES. ARE. SO THIS BILL PROPOSES TO SHORTER RE CALIBRATE HOW WE ARE IMPLEMENTING AND OVERSEEING THIS GROWING INDUSTRY. BY USING THE STANDARD OF TAGGING PLANTS AT A YOUNG AGE. ALLOWING THEM TO BE ASSESSED BASED ON THEIR SIZE. WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN DO QUICKLY VISUALLY IN A LARGE FACILITY. AND. IT DOESN'T SPECIFICALLY BY CHANGING DEFINITION MATURE CANNABIS PLANTS TO MEAN ANY PLANT OVER EIGHT INCHES IN HEIGHT OR WIDTH. CENTER FLOWERING. REQUIRES PLACE WE TAGGED AT AN EARLIER STAGE AND EASIER TO UNDERSTAND. IS YOUR OF IDENTIFY STATE. DRAGON ACCORSI ANY OF US THAT THAT. GO OUT TO THE NURSERY TO BUY PLANTS OR IT IN NUMBER PLEASE A CELL PLANTS. IT'S VERY COMMON NOW TO HAVE LITTLE TAGS PUT ON ALL MANNER OF PLANTS IT'S IT. STANDARD TECHNOLOGY THAT RECYCLABLE IT DOESN'T DAMAGE THE PLANT. IT'S ACTUALLY A BUSINESS RETAIN IN A LOT OF SETTINGS BUT HERE WE ARE USING FOR A LAW ENFORCEMENT PURPOSE. AND. SO I PRESENT THIS BILL TWO YOU AS YOU MOVE FORWARD WITH OUR COMMERCIAL CANNABIS MARKET WE DO NEED TO HAVE RULES. THAT ALLOW. LAW ENFORCEMENT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO IMPLEMENT THEM IN A CLEAR AND STRAIGHTFORWARD MANNER. I PERSONALLY AM COMMITTED TO MOVING THE BILL FORWARD. AND JUST REMAIN IN A POSTURE OF CONVERSATION WITH ALL INTERESTED STAKEHOLDERS. TO UNDERSTAND WHAT SORT OF FEEDBACK WE GET. AND. BUT I THINK THIS BILL DEFTLY ADDRESSES AN IMPORTANT NEED. AND. I'M PLEASED TO BRING IT TO TODAY I UNDERSTAND YOU ARE NOT. A. SUBCOMMITTEE BOAT. BE DELIGHTED TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. ONLY. THANK YOU RECYCLING TO HAVE WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. SEEING NON PERHAPS NOT IN THE ROOM AT THIS TIME SO THERE ARE. PERSONS IN SUPPORT AND I DO THINK YOUR PURSES ACTUALLY WHO HAVE. SOME CONCERNS. BUT I JUST WANT TO SAY MY MY APPROACH WILL BE TO COLLABORATE WITH EVERYBODY. TO WORK THROUGH THOSE THINGS I REQUEST AN AYE VOTE AND YOU TO CONVENE THING CERTAINLY TAKE YOU ARE NOT AT RISK. WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. YEAH. VERY GOOD. THIS JURY MEMBERS RAND MARTIN ON BEHALF OF CMG KHALIFA WHICH IS WHY THE LARGEST VERTICALLY INTEGRATED CAMP CANVAS OPERATIONS IN THE STATE BASED IN SAN JOSE WE DO A LOT OF CULTIVATION. WE HAVE EXPRESSED SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THE BILL ON A TO THE AUTHOR CERTAINLY TO SOME CONCERNS ABOUT WHETHER THEIR WORKLOAD IN. I IMPACTS ON US ON CONCERNS ABOUT THE SIZE OF THE PLANNED WHETHER IT'S A VIABLE OR NOT AND WHETHER IT'S FRAGILE AND. HOWEVER IN RECENT CONVERSATIONS US IN LAST TWENTY FOUR HOURS WITH MY FOLKS IN SAN JOSE. WE THINK THAT THERE MAY BE SOME OPTIONS THAT WE NEED TO LOOK AT WE APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR OF OTHERS WILLINGNESS TO LOOK AT ALTERNATIVES LOOK AT OPTIONS WILL FOR TALKING TO AND WE ENCOURAGE THE COMMITTEE TO MOVE THE BILL FORWARD TODAY. THANK YOU I THANK YOU ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE. MEMBERS WISHING TO ASK. QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. SEEING NONE. AS YOU MENTIONED WE ARE SUBCOMMITTEE WILL TAKE IT UP BUT I APPRECIATE YOU AND THE OPPOSITION NOW WORKING THIS OUT BEFORE BECAUSE APPROPRIATE. VERY GOOD AND I DO WANT TO SAY HELLO TO CLOSE I THINK THE WORK OF THIS COMMITTEE. TAKING THIS LARGE SUBJECT MATTER AREA AND DEVELOPING ORANGE TO FLEX PARTY'S HEARING THAT. BEING P. COMMITTEE I THINK IS VERY IMPORTANT HAVE THAT. POLICY EXPERTISE IN ONE COMMITTEE. AND I JUST THANK YOU FOR ALL YOUR WORKLOAD. THANK THANK YOU SCHOOL. WILL TAKE THAT UP AS VOTE WILL BECOME A QUORUM. NEXT UP WE'LL HEAR FILE ITEM EIGHT. AB TWENTY SEVEN SIXTY BY SOME WOMEN WOULD GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS. THANK YOU FOR THE UMPTEENTH RESENT AB TWENTY SEVEN SIXTY. THERE IS A DRUG EPIDEMIC IN CALIFORNIA PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY OPIOIDS INCLUDING HEROIN. ENDLESSLY MADE FENTANYL AND OTHER HIGH THE HIGH HIGH POTENCY OF SYNTHETIC OPIOIDS. IN TWENTY SIXTEEN THERE WERE FORTY SIX HUNDRED FIFTY FOUR OVERDOSE DEATHS IN CALIFORNIA. NATIONWIDE MORE THAN SIXTY THREE THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS DIED AS RESULT OF OVERDOSES YOU OVERDOSE RATE. EXCEEDS THE PEAK OF DEATHS DURING THE AIDS CRISIS IN NINETEEN NINETY FIVE. GUN RELATED DEATHS IN NINETEEN NINETY THREE AND CAR CRASH DEATHS IN NINETEEN SEVENTY TWO. THE FIGURE ALSO EXCEEDS A NUMBER OF AMERICAN SOLDIERS WHO DIED DURING THE VIETNAM WAR. AB TWENTY SEVEN SIXTY IS A BILL DESIGNED TO DO ONE SIMPLE THING SAVE LIVES. THE LOCKS ON HYDROCHLORIDE IS AN OPIOID ANTAGONIST THAT ACTS IMMEDIATELY TO REVERSE THE EFFECTS OF AN OPIOID OVERDOSE. AB TWENTY SEVEN SIXTY REQUIRES HEALTH CARE PRESCRIBERS WHEN ISSUING AN OPI PRESCRIPTION TWO IDENTIFIED AT RISK PATIENTS. CO PRESCRIBED NALOXONE AND PROVIDE EDUCATION ON ITS PURPOSE AND HOW TO USE IT. HOW TO USE IT TO THE PATIENT AND AND MEMBERS OF THEIR HOUSEHOLDS? IT ISN'T OFTEN ONE HAS THE PRIVILEGE OF BEING ABLE TO DIRECTLY QUOTE THE SURGEON GENERAL OF THE UNITED STATES. HOWEVER LAST WEEK IN THE FIRST NATIONAL ADVISORY ISSUED BY A SURGEON GENERAL SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND FIVE. US ATTORNEY GENERAL JEROME ADAMS. ISSUED AN ADVISORY EMPHASIZING TO THE US ATTORNEY US SURGEON GENERAL. DRUM ADAMS ISSUED AN ADVISORY EMPHASIZING THE IMPORTANCE OF THE OVERDOSE REVERSING DRUG NALOXONE. STATED FOR THAT THAT FOR PATIENTS CURRENTLY TAKING HIGH DOSES OF OPIOIDS AS PRESCRIBED FOR PAIN. INDIVIDUALS MISUSING OPIOIDS INDIVIDUALS USING ILLICIT OPIOID SUCH AS HEROIN OFFEND NO. HEALTHCARE PRACTITIONERS. FAMILY AND FRIENDS A FEE OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE AN OP A DECISION DISORDER AND FOR COMMUNITY MEMBERS WHO COME INTO CONTACT WITH PEOPLE AT RISK FOR OPIUM GOING OVER DOES. KNOWING HOW TO USE THE LOCKS ON AND KEEPING IT WITHIN REACH CAN SAVE A LIFE. THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION ADVISES HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS TO CONSIDER OFFERING NALOXONE TO INDIVIDUALS WHEN FACTORS THAT INCREASE THE RISK. OF OVERT OF FOR OVER DOES ARE PRESENT FOR CONCURRENT BENZODIAZEPINE USE OUR PRESIDENT. IN ADDITION TO CDC AT LEAST ELEVEN OTHER NATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS RECOMMEND INTEGRATING THE LOCKS ON WITH AT RISK HOPE YOUR PRESCRIPTIONS INCLUDING THE AMA. THE APHA THE AMERICAN SOCIETY OF ADDICTION MEDICINE THE CENTERS FOR MEDICAID AND MEDICARE SERVICES. AND THE INDIAN HEALTH SERVICE. WHILE THESE RECOMMENDATIONS ARE NOT LAW AND AS SUCH DO NOT CARRY THE WEIGHT OF LAW AB TWENTY SEVEN SIXTY WOULD MANDATE PRESCRIBERS TO FOLLOW A SPECIFIC PROTOCOL RELATED TO IDENTIFIED RISK POOLS OF PATIENTS. A PROTOCOL THAT INCREASES THE LIKELIHOOD OF SURVIVAL. SHOULD THEY HAVE AN OVERDOSE EXPERIENCE HERE WITH ME TODAY AND SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF THE VA. I'M NOT SO SEE OUR. EVER OUR PURSE FROM THE VA BUT I DO HAVE. I GLENN GLENN BACCUS FROM THE DRUG POLICY ALLIANCE'S HERE. BECAUSE ABOUT. GOOD MORNING GOING BACK IS FOR DRUG POLICY ALLIANCE. WE'VE WORKED IN RECENT YEARS WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBERS BLOOM AVIANO AND MAYES. ON BILLS TO WIDELY AVAILABILITY OF NOW LOCKS ON THROUGH PHARMACIES THROUGH HARM REDUCTION PROGRAMS. AND THROUGH CAKE YOU TWELVE SCHOOLS. WE'VE WORKED TO WIDEN THE USE OF NALOXONE BY LINE FOR SATAN SEES INCLUDING THE VERY SUCCESSFUL PILOT SAN DIEGO COUNTY AND THE PROGRAM IN SAN FRANCISCO COUNTY. NOW LOCKS ON WAS FIRST APPROVED BY THE FDA IN NINETEEN SEVENTY TWO SORT OF THE FORTY FIVE YEAR. HISTORY AND TRACK RECORD OF SAFE ADMINISTRATION IT'S WELL ESTABLISHED THAT LAY PERSONS SPOUSES OF A PATIENT FOR EXAMPLE. GOOD SUCCESSFULLY REVERSE AN OVERDOSE AND SAVE THE LIFE OF A PATIENT. WE NEED THE ANTIDOTE TO OPIOID OVERDOSE. IT IS MANY PLACES AS WE CAN GET IT. WHEREVER AND WHENEVER PEOPLE ARE USING OPIOIDS BE THEY HEROIN OR PRESCRIPTION OPIOIDS. OR A PRESCRIPTION OPIOIDS IN COMBINATION WITH OTHER PRESCRIPTION DRUGS LIKE BENZODIAZEPINES OR WITH ALCOHOL. IF THIS BILL IS NOT ONLY A LOGICAL STEP A LOGICAL EXPANSION CONSISTENT WITH THE SURGEON GENERAL'S RECOMMENDATION. IT'S AN URGENTLY NEEDED STEP TO SAVE LIVES STARTING TODAY. MY GUESS STARTING JANUARY ONE. THANK YOU SIR. THANK YOU ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU TOM RENT FREE WITH THE CALIFORNIA BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION. AYE ANYTHING THAT WOULD CAN INCREASE ACCESS TO THIS LIFESAVING MEDICATION THE LOCKS ON IS A GOOD THING SO WE SUPPORT THIS BILL. THE SHOCK EVENTS OF THE COUNTY HEALTH EXECUTIVES ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA IN SUPPORT. MR JOHNSON TO BE HALF A CALIFORNIA PHARMACISTS ASSOCIATION ALSO IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU THE SHOWING DECISION SUPPORT SEEING NONE WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE. WE'LL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ANY MEMBERS WISHING TO ASK QUESTIONS OR MAKE COMMENTS. SEEING NOT. STUART TRULY CLOSE ADJUSTER. AB TWENTY SEVEN SIXTY WOULD BE ONE STEP TOWARDS INCREASING THE SURVIVAL RATE OF INDIVIDUALS EXPERIENCING AN OVERDOSE IT'S US IT'S SIMPLE IT WORKS IT SAVES LIVES ASK YOUR AYE VOTE WHEN YOU HAVE A. FULL COMMITTEE THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR BRINGING OUT OF FOUR THANK YOU MENTIONED WE ARE SUBCOMMITTEE STILL WILL BRING THIS UP FOR A VOTE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH GIVE A SECOND ITEM I DO THINK. ITEM NINE AB TWENTY SEVEN EIGHTY NINE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I'M PLEASE PRESENT AB TWENTY SEVEN EIGHTY NINE. AB TWENTY SEVEN EIGHTY NINE REQUIRES THAT BY TWENTY TWENTY ALL PRESCRIBERS AND DISPENSERS HAVE THE TECHNOLOGY TO CREATE PRESCRIPTIONS ELECTRONICALLY. KNOWN AS E. PRESCRIBING AND THAT BY TWENTY TWENTY ONE E. PRESCRIBING FOR MOST MEDICATIONS WOULD BE REQUIRED. THE RATIONALE FOR THIS BILL IS TWO FOLD. FIRST THE PRESCRIBING IS AN IMPORTANT TOOL TO ADDRESS THE OPIOID CRISIS BY REDUCING THE QUANTITY OF OPIOIDS OBTAIN. FRAUDULENT MEANS SUCH AS STOLEN PRESCRIPTION PADS OR ALTERED PRESCRIPTIONS. SECOND E. PRESCRIBING WOULD REDUCE PRESCRIPTION ERRORS AND INCREASED INCREASED THE QUALITY OF PATIENT CARE BY REDUCING MEDICATION OR DOSAGE ERRORS. MORE THAN ONE POINT THREE MILLION PEOPLE ARE INJURED BY MEDICATION ERRORS ANNUALLY IN THE U. S. AND MOST FAMOUS MOST THESE MISTAKES ARE PREVENTABLE. ACCORDING TO A STUDY CONDUCTED AT JOHN HOPKINS MEDICAID MEDICATION OUTPATIENT PHARMACY. EIGHTY NINE PERCENT OF HAND WRITTEN PRESCRIPTIONS FAILED TO ME BEST PRACTICE GUIDELINES ORDER AND OR WERE MISSING EIGHTY FOR HIM FOR MISSING INFORMATION. EIGHTY NINE PERCENT. AND THAT DOESN'T EVEN MENTION HANDWRITING WHICH I'M TOTALLY GUILTY. BY COMPARISON NOT A SINGLE PRESCRIPTION ISSUED ELECTRONICALLY IN THAT STUDY AYE CONTAINED THOSE TYPES OF ERRORS. DESPITE WHAT YOU MAY HEAR TODAY E. PRESCRIBING IS NOT A NEW CONCEPT. AS FAR BACK AS TWO THOUSAND AND THREE THE CENTERS FOR MEDICARE AND MEDICAID SERVICES INCLUDED E. PRESCRIBING IN THE MEDICARE MODERNIZATION ACT. THEY LAUDED THE PRESCRIBING AS AS A PRESCRIBERS ABILITY TO ELECTRONICALLY SEND AN ACCURATE. ERROR FREE AND UNDERSTANDABLE PRESCRIPTION AND THAT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT ELEMENT IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF PATIENT CARE. IN TWO THOUSAND AND SIXTEEN ONE POINT SIX BILLION PRESCRIPTIONS WITH A BE. WEARING WISH IT WERE WERE ISSUED ELECTRONICALLY IN THE UNITED STATES NINE STATES INCLUDING. STATES WITH AN INCREASE OF SEVENTEEN STATES. INCLUDING STATES WITH LARGE SIXTIES IN NINE STATES HAVE THIS OF HAVE THIS. LARA NOW SEVENTEEN STATES ARE CONSIDERING IT AND EASIER LARGE STATES. LIKE NEW YORK AND SMALLER MORE RURAL STATES LIKE MAINE IN RHODE ISLAND. AND A BILL IS UP IN CONGRESS THAT WOULD MANDATE THE PRESCRIBING FOR CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES AND MEDICARE PART D.. EAST PRESCRIBED IS NO LONGER A FUTURE TECHNOLOGY IT EXISTS IT IS READILY AVAILABLE AND IT'S TIME HAS COME ELECTRONIC HEALTHCARE RECORDS AND. SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT HAD MADE THE ADOPTION OF E. PRESCRIBING THE NORM ADOPTION OF TECHNOLOGY TO IMPROVE PATIENT OUTCOMES HAS ALWAYS BEEN A HALLMARK OF THE HEALTH HEALTH CARE PROFESSION. ADOPTION OF E. PRESCRIBING IS NO EXCEPTION WITH ME TODAY TESTIFY. IS. ON BEHALF OF THIS BILL THE VIRGINIA HEROLD EXECUTIVE OFFICER THE CALIFORNIA FARM ABOARD A PHARMACY. WHO ASSISTED US IN DRAFTING THIS LEGISLATION AND DOCTOR A REEF CARAMBA REPRESENTING THE AMERICAN PHYSICIAN? THANK YOU AND GOOD MORNING POP THE BOARD IS ACTUALLY A VERY LONG TIME SUPPORTER OF. EAT PRESCRIBING GOING BACK WE AMENDED CALIFORNIA LAWN NINETEEN NINETY FOUR TO ALLOW IT WE HAD TO WAIT ANOTHER FIFTEEN YEARS FOR THE D. E. TO DEVELOP THEIR REQUIREMENTS. THAT WE HAVE FORESEEN THAT ADVENT OF THE PRESCRIBING AS A WAY FOR CONSUMER PROTECTION FOR QUITE AWHILE. THERE ARE MULTIPLE ON. WAIT THINGS THAT YOU'LL PERSKY PRESCRIBE IT WILL BENEFIT ANY OPIOID CRISIS IS PART OF THE REASON YOU SEE THIS MOMENTUM FEDERALLY. IS OTHER STATES ARE SEEING THIS IS A VALUABLE TOOL TO ADDRESS WHAT THEY'RE SEEING IN THEIR STATES. SO ONE OF THE VERY OBVIOUS THINGS IS THE IMPROVEMENT IN THE ABILITY TO READ A PRESCRIPTION AND MAKE IT MORE LEGIBLE. THAT ALSO OCCURS IN THE PHARMACY WHEN THEY'RE INPUTTING THE DATA INTO THE COMPUTER IT WOULD COME IN E. PRESCRIBING DIRECTLY INTO THE SYSTEM SO NOT ONLY WITH THE PRESCRIBER OR MISREAD THE PRESCRIBERS WRITING. NOT OCCUR AT THE PHARMACY ITSELF WOULDN'T ADD ADDITIONAL AIRS WHEN THEY'RE IN PUTTING THE INFORMATION INTO THE COMPUTER. IT WOULD REDUCE PATIENT WAIT TIME BECAUSE PRESCRIPTION WOULD ALREADY GO TO THE PHARMACY OF A PRESCRIBERS CHOICE. IT WOULD ENABLE FAST RETRIEVAL OF RECORDS BECAUSE EVERYTHING IS ALREADY IN THEIR ELECTRONICALLY. IN A PHARMACY WHERE SPACE IS VERY COMPACT AND VERY VALUABLE IT WILL SIMPLIFY THE RECORD STORAGE WE HAVE RECORD REQUIREMENTS THAT REQUIRE RECORD BEING KEPT ON THE PREMISES FOR THREE YEARS. AND FOR VARIOUS THINGS SOMETIMES OF ONE SEVEN OR TEN YEARS AND THAT BECOMES A REAL STORAGE PROBLEM. BE ON IT WILL MOST IMPORTANTLY THOUGH IT WILL SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCE THE ABILITY OF PEOPLE TO GET A PRESCRIPTION AND MODIFY IT FOR THEIR OWN GOAL. SO FOR EXAMPLE I GET A CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES PRESCRIPTION NOW AND I ED A ONE IN FRONT OF THAT TWENTY AND SUDDENLY INSTEAD OF TWENTY PILLS I'M GETTING A HUNDRED TWENTY HILLS. AND THAT IS VIRTUALLY UNDETECTED. ON ELECTRONIC PRESCRIBING THAT WOULD GO AWAY. IT WILL ALSO. STOP SOME OF THE ON DRUG DIVERSION THAT'S GOING ON IN SAN DIEGO RECENTLY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ON WENT AFTER. A. FRAUDULENT DOCTOR SHOPPER THAT ENDED UP WITH ONE POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF OXYCONTIN. THAT HE HAD OBTAINED FROM GOING ONLINE FIND FAULTS THAT WERE NOT LEGITIMATE AYE ME THEY FIND OUT THAT WITHIN THE PRESCRIBER INVOLVING YET HE WAS STILL ABLE TO WALK OUT WITH ONE POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS WITH THE. SO THIS WOULD SOLVE THAT PROBLEM BECAUSE AGAIN THE IDENTITY OF THE PRESCRIBER IS ASCERTAINED AT THE TIME THAT THE. PRESCRIPTION IS BEING IN FACT. AND THE PHARMACY CAN IDENTIFY IN CONFIRMED THAT PRESCRIBER THIS. AS DOCTOR WHAT INDICATED THAT RIGHT AT THE MOMENT WE'VE GOT THE SEVENTEEN STATES CALIFORNIA'S ONE OF THEM WHERE AN E. PRESCRIBING LA IS PENDING. AND I STRONGLY ENCOURAGE AND ASK YOUR AYE VOTE ON THIS. THIS AND WE'VE BEEN WAITING A LONG TIME TO ACTUALLY MAKE IT HAPPEN. MONNING COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS A DOCTOR KALRA MARA FROM THE CHIEF MEDICAL OFFICER WHO WOULDN'T CLINIC OF MEDICAL GROUP APPEARING ON BEHALF OF AMERICA'S POSITION GROUPS. AS THE PRESCRIBING PHYSICIAN AND. ON BEHALF OF FOUR HUNDRED SEVENTY PROVIDERS. THEIR TWO PILLARS THAT WE DEEM INCLUDING PORN TO PATIENTS. HEALTHCARE PATIENT SAFETY AND PATIENT EXPERIENCE. THE PATIENT SAFETY BE SUFFERED OF IT IS IS SELF EVIDENT. WRITING PRESCRIPTIONS ON A PAPER. THIS IS BEING ABLE TO SECURELY TRANSMIT THEM TO A PHARMACY. AND REMOVING AND MINIMIZING THE RISKS OF ERRORS AND LEGIBILITY ARE INTRUDING PARKING BUT ALSO AS A PRESCRIBING PHYSICIAN WHEN YOU'RE WRITING A PRESCRIPTION FOR MISSION IN FRONT OF YOU THAT DAY. YOU ARE TRACK WHAT THEY'VE ALREADY BEEN ON. AND IF YOU HAVE A LITTLE TRONIC A BILL TO TRACK THAT IT MINIMIZES THOSE ARE IS IN TERMS OF CONSISTENT PRESCRIPTIONS BETWEEN PAST AND AND AND KERN PRESCRIPTIONS. THE PATIENT EXPERIENCE PART OF IT CANNOT BE UNDERSTATED. AS A PATIENT YOU KNOW WHAT WHEN I GOING TO SEE MY DOCTOR I DON'T BE SHUFFLING THE PIECE OF PAPER BETWEEN MYSELF. OF THE PHYSICIAN AND THE FUN THE PHARMACY I'D LIKE TO GET CONVENE HEALTHCARE. US HE MY POSITION MAKE SURE THE INFORMATION GETS PROSPECT OF THE PHARMACY. SO THAT YOU AS A PATIENT WHEN I GO TO PICK IT UP ITS READY. AND OF THIS ANY ISSUES THIS COMMUNICATION BETWEEN PHARMACY IN PHYSICIAN HAPPENING IN THE BACK. SO THE PATIENT SAFETY AND PATIENT EXPERIENCE PART OF IT ARE A HUGE PART OF WHAT WE DO AS PHYSICIANS. AND WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY ADDITIONAL WOULD SUSPICIONS BEGINS PORT NAME AND AFFILIATION IF YOU WISH TO DO SO AT DAVID GONZALEZ ON BEHALF OF AMERICA'S POSITION GROUPS REPRESENTING PROVIDERS IN OVER THREE HER MEDICAL GROUPS ACROSS FORTY FOUR STATES. HAVE A BEER IN SUPPORT. BOB SHARON WE HAVE AGES TREATMENT CENTERS WE'D LIKE TO THANK DR WOOD FOR HIS LEADERSHIP IN THE ISSUE OF OPIOID ADDICTION AND WE SUPPORT THE BILL WHOLEHEARTEDLY.

SIMON BAKER AND I PUT APOLOGIZE AFTER COMING FROM OTHER SPOT THAT I MAY HAVE MISSED YOUR ADDRESSES AND JUST AS THE TIME FRAME AND THE FEASIBILITY. FOR PHYSICIANS TO MEET THAT AND I REYES ACTORS HAVE BEEN CONSTITUENTS MY DISTRICT ARE PHYSICIANS YOUR IQ THEY IF EXPLAINED HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS THEY PAID INTO UPGRADING THEIR SOFTWARE UPGRADING THEIR. EQUIPMENT TO BE ABLE COMPLY I JUST WONDER I KNOW THERE WERE CONCERNS ABOUT THE TIME FRAME AGAIN. IT'S POSSIBLE THAT YOU ADDRESS THAT WHEN I WAS OUT BUT AM VERY INTERESTED IN THAT AND THE FEASIBILITY FOR IT HAPPENING THE RECENT LISTAT THE TIME FRAME NOT THE REASONABLENESS. OF THE REQUESTED TIME FRAME. WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT IMPLEMENTATION BEGINNING TWENTY TWENTY ONE THAT'S THREE YEARS FROM NOW? A LOT OF ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORD SYSTEMS ACTUALLY ALLOW THIS CAPABILITY MY PHYSICIAN DOES THAT NOW CAN. AND. WITH SEVEN STATES CURRENTLY ARE NINE STATES A CURLY HAVE THIS IN PLACE AND ANOTHER SEVENTEEN THAT ARE ACTUALLY CONSIDERING IT. I WOULD VENTURE TO GUESS THAT THE THE TECHNOLOGY IS THERE AND AND MORE AND MORE STATES TO COME ONLINE THE MORE MORE AFFORDABLE BE IT WILL BE EVEN MORE USER FRIENDLY IT WILL BE. IN AYE AYE IN ADDITION. AT SOME POINT THAT PHYSICIANS MAY BE ABLE TO DO THIS THROUGH A NAP OR SOMETHING AS WELL. OR A SECURE PORTAL BUT YOU KNOW. I. I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY OR HOW FEW I SHOULD SAY PHYSICIANS DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO A COMPUTER. IN THIS DAY AND AGE UMP THERE MAY BE ONE OR TWO WERE FEW OUT THERE AND I'M SENSITIVE TO THAT. BY. BUT I THINK IN THE LONG RUN THIS IS MUCH SAFER. MUCH MORE EFFECTIVE AND MUCH BETTER FOR THE CONSUMER GET THINK YOU FOR ADDRESSING. THEY DO VERY MUCH ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. SENIOR ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS ASSEMBLY MEMBER WOULD DO YOU WISH TO CLOSE THIS OUT WHEN YOU HAVE A OF COURSE MADE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE.

CHIU. EGGMAN. FALL. GIPSON. GRAYSON. HOLDEN. IRWIN. MULLIN TING. SO VERY MUCH REPEAT. YOU'RE WELCOME. LET ME START OFF BY SAYING THAT I'M GLAD TO TAKE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS REGARDING THE SUNSET DATE AND BROADENING THE DIFFERENT THE DEFINITION OF THROUGH THE BILL SAFE STORAGE PRODUCTS. THANK YOU. WE'VE WE'VE HEARD ALL MORNING ABOUT THE OF HOPE OPIOID AT EPIDEMIC I DON'T THINK I NEED THAT KIND OF BELABOR THE POINT ON ONE OF THE BIG ISSUES OBVIOUSLY IS THE ACCESS OF OPIOIDS. TO CHILDREN WHO ARE WHO ARE JUST CURIOUS ABOUT WHAT'S IN THAT MODEL IN TEAMS WHO ARE CURIOUS ABOUT I WONDER WHAT THIS DRUG WILL BE LIKE AND WHEN WHAT WHAT WHAT THEY CAN DO WITH IT. AND WE'VE HEARD ABOUT KILL PARTY'S ROUTINES GO THROUGH THE CABINET TAKE OUT PILLS. SHOP AT A PARTY PUT AMENABLE IN AND SHARE THEM WITH EACH OTHER WITHOUT REGARD TO WHAT THEY REALLY CAN DO AND AND WHAT THEY'RE. ARE. THIS. BILL WOULD SET UP AN OP AN OPPORTUNITY FOR PHARMACISTS. TALK TO PATIENTS THAT ARE RECEIVING OP JORDANES ARE DANGEROUS UP PRESCRIPTIONS AND PROVIDE AND. IT THAT THERE'S NO REQUIREMENT THAT IT BE PURCHASE NO REQUIREMENT THAT THE YEAH PHARMACISTS HAVE ALL OF THE SAMPLES JUST THAT THEY HAVE AT LEAST ONE KIND OF SAFE DEVICE. AND THAT THEY HAVE IT ON AND TALK TO THEIR. PEOPLE THAT ARE GETTING THE PRESCRIPTIONS. THE WHOLE PURPOSE OF THIS IS TO EDUCATE THE PUBLIC ABOUT THE DANGER OF OPIOIDS AND TO GIVE THEM AN OPTION TO BE ABLE TO KEEP IT SAFE AND AS YOU CAN SEE THEY'RE. THEY'RE THEY'RE PRETTY. THEY'RE PRETTY HARDY AND IT AT AT A MINIMUM IF SOMEONE'S GOING TO TAKE IT AND TRY TO DESTROY IT OPEN AT THE PARENT WILL UNDERSTAND THAT SOMEBODY IS IS I'M MESSING AROUND WITH THEIR DRUGS. AND THAT THEY NEED TO TAKE ACTION IMMEDIATELY THAT'S THE KIND OF OF PREVENTIVE EDUCATION PROJECT TO THAT WE WERE HOPING THAT THIS WILL AFFECT IN OBVIOUSLY. IT SAID CHILD SAFETY ISSUE. AND ALL OF THEIR PHARMACIES WOULD BE REQUIRED TO KEEP. KEEP AND CARRY THE SAFE STORAGE PRODUCTS FOR SALE AT THE PHARMACY. WITH ME TODAY IS DR RAJESH DEPARTING. OUT DAY AFTER DAY A MEDICAL DIRECTOR OF THE PEDIATRIC EMERGENCY MEDICINE AT SAN FRANCISCO GENERAL HOSPITAL TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT. PLEASE WHATEVER READY. THERE ARE MANY. NEVER IS THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. AGAIN MY NAME IS RIGHT STAFF YOU I'M A PHYSICIAN SPECIALISTS IN PEDIATRIC EMERGENCY MEDICINE AND THIS IS A PREP PROFESSOR AT THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA SAN FRANCISCO AND MEDICAL DIRECTOR FOR HAPPY AT YOUR MERCY MEDICINE AT SIMPSON'S GOOD GENERAL HIGH. I'M PROVIDING TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT OF ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY FIFTY NINE AND SAFE STORAGE PRODUCTS. THE REASON BEING IS OF THE OPIOID EPIDEMIC AS WE KNOW. HAS NOT SPARED CHILDREN. AS OUTLINED IN A RECENT STUDY IN THE JOURNAL PEDIATRICS. WE HAVE SEEN INTENSIVE CARE ADMISSIONS FOR PEDIATRIC PATIENTS DOUBLE WITHIN THE PAST TWELVE YEARS. AND THOSE ARE TWO GROUPS OF PEOPLE PREDOMINATELY ITS YOUNG CHILDREN LESSEN THE AGE OF FOUR AND TEENS. KIDS ARE CURIOUS ESPECIALLY YOUNG CHILDREN YOUNG CHILDREN FREQUENTLY ARE EXPOSED TO HARMFUL LIFE THREATENING. MEDICATION THROUGH IMPROPER STORAGE. DESPITE BEST EFFORTS OF THE SUBSTANCE ISN'T LOCKED UP IS A PRETTY GOOD CHANCE IT'LL FIND ITS WAY INTO THE HANDS RESOURCES CHILD'S. AND ADOLESCENCE ADOLESCENTS ARE RELENTLESS. ACCESS OPIOIDS INCREASES THE LIKELIHOOD THAT THEY WILL BE USED FOR RECREATION OR USED BY TEEN IN ATTEMPT OR SELF HARM. OKAY WHICH ARE IMPORTANT CLASS OF MEDICATIONS ARE USEFUL WHEN OTHER MEDICATIONS HAVE FAILED TO PROVIDE PAIN RELIEF ESPECIALLY IN CHRONIC AND TERMINAL CONDITIONS. BUT MAKE NO MISTAKE THESE MEDICATIONS ARE LIFE THREATENING ESPECIALLY TO THE YOUNG CHILD. THEN CALL THE SUDDEN DROP IN BLOOD PRESSURE. BECAUSE IT'S HARD TO STOP BREATHING AND CAN LEAD TO DEATH EVEN IN SMALL DOSES. I'VE CARED FOR NUMEROUS CHILDREN WHO'VE EITHER ACCIDENTALLY OR INTENSELY BEEN EXPOSED TO THESE MEDICATIONS AND IN JUST ABOUT EVERY CASE THE MEDICATIONS WERE IN THE HOUSEHOLD AND HAD NOT BEEN LOCKED OUT. WE'RE OVER OPIOIDSARE NOT THE ONLY CLASS OF MEDICATIONS THAT NEED TO BE SAFELY STORED. THERE'S A WHOLE LISTA MEDICATIONS UP ALL THE DUBIOUS LIST KNOWN AS ONE PILL CAN KILL. COMMON BLOOD PRESSURE MEDICATIONS PAIN MEDICATIONS AND DIABETES MEDICATIONS CAN BE LETHAL WHICH JUST A SINGLE DOSE. KEY MEDICATIONS ARE LOCKED VICE IS THE ONLY WAY TO ENSURE THAT A YOUNG CHILD OR CURIOUS TEAM IS NOT GOING TO BECOME EXPOSED TO DANGEROUS MEDICATION. AB TWENTY EIGHT FIFTY NINE LAST FAMILIES HAVE EASIER ACCESS TO SUCH LOCKING DEVICES AND I SUPPORT THE BILL. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES WISHING TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF INFLATION IF YOU WISH TO DO SO. YEAH JOHN WINGER ACTUALLY A PINCH HITTING FOR CULT PEOPLE THAT COULDN'T BE HERE SOME OF VOIGTS MY SUPPORT FOR CALIFORNIA COALITION FOR CHILDREN SEE EIGHTEEN HEALTH. AS WELL AS CORPS MEDICAL CLINIC. KIM BOX WITH GATEKEEPER INNOVATION AND SUPPORT. RAND MORE NUMBER HAVE THE AIDS HEALTHCARE FOUNDATION SUPPORT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES WISHING TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT. SEEM NONE ANY WITNESSES WISHING TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION AT THIS TIME. SEEN NO WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS AT THIS TIME SOMEONE BAKER THANK YOU M. STRICTLY LIMIT WITH THIS BILL BECAUSE I WANNA MAKE SURE THERE'S. FLEXIBILITY. YOU KNOW THERE ARE MANY. OTHER ITEMS THAT WE WOULD WANNA SECURE AWAY FROM KIDS IN THE HOUSEHOLD LIKE CLEANING PRODUCTS AND AND OTHER POINTS SO. I WE DON'T ALWAYS. FOR SAY A RETAILER WHICH IS WHAT THE PHARMACIST WOULD BE IT IN THIS ROLE TO HAVE A EITHER SPECIFIC DEVICE FOR SENATE DEVICES FOR THINGS WE THINK THAT OUR. OF DANGER AND TO TWO KIDS SO I'D. WONDERING. WHY YOUR HEY THAT FRONTLINE HIM TO THE RETAILER LINE WHAT FLEXIBILITY AS IT HAVE FOR THE PHARMACIST WHO IS FINDING THESE THINGS ARE MOVING OFF THE SHELVES NOBODY'S? LOOKING AT IT. BECAUSE IT FLEXIBILITY IS IMPORTANT ON THE SIDE OF COUPLE OTHER FOUGHT QUESTIONS ON THAT AS WELL. SO THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION TYPE GUY APPRECIATED. THE THIS HAS A SENSEI SUNSET SO WE WILL KNOW WHETHER IT'S IT'S HAVING SOME EFFICACY. UP BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY THE PHARMACIST DOESN'T HAVE TO HAVE A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT MODELS. THEY JUST HAVE TO HAVE AT LEAST ONE TO BE ABLE TO SHOW PEOPLE AND TO SAY HERE IS A WAY TO BE ABLE TO KEEP YOUR DRUGS SAFE. AND I THINK THE DISTINCTION IS THAT WE DON'T HAVE A WE DON'T HAVE AN EPIDEMIC OF SOME OF THESE OTHER CLEANING SUPPLIES NO QUESTION THAT THEY'RE DANGEROUS AND AND MANY OF THEM HAVE. CHILDPROOF CAPS THIS ONE IS A LITTLE BIT MORE SOPHISTICATED BECAUSE TEENAGERS ARE THE ONES THAT ARE LIKELY TO. TO DRINK THE CLEANERS. WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING TEENAGERS CAN GET INTO AS WELL OR IF THEY GET INTO IT THEN THE PARENTS AWARE OF THE FACT THAT THERE'S SOME OF THAT THAT THEIR. PRODUCT HAS BEEN. AT. TAKEN IN SOME WAY SO THE IDEA AND IN REALLY WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR IS AND IT'S AN EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITY AND AND WE HAVEN'T. TOLD THE PHARMACISTS HOW THEY HAVE TO. MARKET THIS I'M JUST THAT IT'S AVAILABLE OKAY AND. EMMERT WE'RE TRYING TO GET AS MUCH FLEXIBILITY AS. SCRATCH VERY HELPFUL AND I ALSO HAVE A QUESTION AS TO THE PENALTY. FOR THE PHARMACIST WHO MAY HAVE FAIL FOR WHATEVER REASON OF ITEMS TAKE OFF THE SHELF AND THEY HAVEN'T QUITE HAD CHANCE TO RESTOCK WHATEVER WHATEVER IT IS. AND IF I READ THE BILL QUICKLY THE. PHARMACISTS BOARD IS THE ONE THAT CAN. IMPOSE A FINE. AND. AND IS THERE ANY SORT OF PROVISIONS YOUR CONCERN MAKES THAT'S NOT GOING TO TAKE AWAY FROM THEIR ABILITY TO BE A PHARMACIST YES. OKAY YES ACTUALLY THEY CAN ACQUIT IMPOSE A FINE IN THE CAN WAIVE THAT IF THEY IF THEY IF THEY FEEL LIKE. IT'S AN AND MINIMAL. VIOLATION. THAT'S IN TO GIVE THEM THE FLEXIBILITY WE ALSO WANT THEM TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE SERVICES WITHOUT IMPAIRING THEIR ABILITY TO BE LICENSE ABSOLUTELY NUTS AND I APPRECIATE IT THE AMENDMENTS ALSO BRING US IN A SENSE THAT HIS HAVING TO BE OPEN ENDED LIKE THIS WOULD BE. VERY PROBLEMATIC NEED TO RE EXAMINE IT SO THANK YOU FOR DOING THAT THINK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH BY SOMEONE BAKER ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. SHE KNOWN DISH RELATIONS WHERE. IF IT RAISES THE AWARENESS WHERE. OPEN HOUSES PEOPLE ARE ARE SHOWING UP AND GOING TO THE MEDICINE CABINETS. UNBELIEVABLE BUT IT REALLY KIND OF. I THINK I IDENTIFIES THE WHOLE ISSUE OF HAVING THOSE PRESCRIPTIONS AVAILABLE FOR ANYBODY THAT MIGHT WANT TO BE ABLE TO LOOK IN THE MEDICINE CABINET THIS IS ONE OF THE SOLUTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AS SOMEONE CAREER I APPRECIATE WORKING WITH YOU IN YOUR OFFICE AS WELL ON THE LANGUAGE TO ADDRESS OF SOME OF THE BALANCING APPROACHES TO IT. AND THEN ALSO RESPECTING OF THE LEGISLATIVE INTENT AND DESIRE SO I APPRECIATE THE ROBUST CONVERSATION THAT WE'VE HAD THANK YOU SO MUCH I THERE'S BEEN A MOTION AND A SECOND.

SECONDHAND DEALERS BRICK AND MORTAR STORES. OF NUMBER ONE HOLDING THE ITEM FOR THIRTY DAYS REPORTING IT TO THE CAPS SYSTEM I DON'T THINK ANY OF THE MEMBERS CURRENTLY SERVING WILL REMEMBER IN. WE DID A LA VERY SIGNIFICANT BILL IN TWO THOUSAND AND. TWELVE WHICH CREATED A VERY LARGE LAW ENFORCEMENT DATABASE PAID FOR BY THE SECONDHAND DEALERS. TO RECORD. INFORMATION THAT WAS PREVIOUSLY HAVE HAVING TO BE PROCESSED BY LAW ENFORCEMENT BUT NOW OUR FOLKS DO IT AND PAY FOR THE SYSTEM. AND WITHIN TWENTY FOUR HOURS LAW ENFORCEMENT. HAS THAT INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO THEM. SPECIFICALLY THE M. COMMERCE AND AND ACTUALLY MY MY OF MY PAWNBROKER WITNESS HERE NEXT TO ME IS GOING TO. GO A LITTLE BIT MORE DEEPLY INTO THAT BUT THAT'S TRULY WHAT KILLING OUR INDUSTRY WOULD WEAKEN THAT WE CAN TOLERATE SOME OF THE OTHER. PLATFORMS COMPETITION BUT. THE EASE WITH WHICH ANYONE CAN. AVAIL THEMSELVES OF AN ITEM ALMOST INSTANTANEOUSLY ON THEIR CELL PHONE IS REALLY TAKING A OF OUR ENTIRE RETAIL SECTION OF OUR BUSINESSES AND. AND ESSENTIALLY GIVING IT UP SO WE TRIED VERY HARD TO WORK THIS BILL. WAS ORIGINALLY INTRODUCED WITH AT COMPLETELY ELIMINATING THE WHOLE. WE THEN IN HOPES OF GAINING NEUTRALITY OF LAW ENFORCEMENT.

ASSISTED TREATMENT SUCH AS PEOPLE NOW FRIEND THAT SAME DOCTOR IS NOT ABLE TO PRESCRIBE THE MEDICATION TO GET OFF OF THE OPIOID AND SO. IT'S AN ISSUE THAT THERE ARE CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS ON HOW MANY AT PATIENTS EACH DOCTOR. COULD COULD TRAIN BUT BUT ALSO THERE IS THE ISSUE THAT PEOPLE WHO GET THEIR MEDICAL LICENSE AND THOSE IN THE FIELD RIGHT NOW. I DON'T HAVE THE TRAINING AND DON'T HAVE A CERTIFICATE TO ALLOW THEM TO PRESCRIBE. DRUGS LIKE DEEP AFRIN AND WE KNOW THAT THE FIRST LINK THE FIRST ITERATION OF THE BILL WAS MORE BRIDES AND WE HAD SOME OPPOSITION FROM. THE CMA AND OTHERS WE THINK WITH A COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS FOCUSING ON JUST THOSE WHO GET THEIR DE A LICENSE. NARROWS IT SIGNIFICANTLY AND DEALS WITH THE ISSUE AT HAND AND FRANKLY WILL ALLOW US TO PROVIDE. MORE PHYSICIANS AND MORE CLINICS THE OPPORTUNITY TO TO TREAT INDIVIDUALS WITH ADDICTION IN CALIFORNIA. AYE WITH ME ARE. A REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE TRANSITIONS CLINIC HERE IN SACRAMENTO DOCTOR NEIL FLYNN AND MISTER TOM RAN FREE FROM THE COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION. CERTAINLY ASKING RIGHT THANK YOU. THANK YOU ROUTE MR MCCARTY. I'M A RETIRED INTERNIST INFECTIOUS DISEASE AND AIDS PHYSICIAN. NOT RETIRED. I HAVE TAKEN UP A TREATMENT OF OPIOID DEPENDENCE. WHAT PEOPLE ARE FEELING AND MY RETIREMENT? I TREATED PEOPLE LIVING WITH PAIN AND WERE SO PURE OBJECTION FOR OVER THIRTY YEARS. LIKE MANY PHYSICIANS I. RECEIVED INADEQUATE PAIN THAT. INADEQUATE EDUCATION IN PAIN MANAGEMENT. OUR AND PAIN CONTROL DURING MEDICAL SCHOOL. AND RESIDENCY TRAINING AS WELL AS AND POST GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION. OUT. RECENTLY THE PARADIGM FOR TREATMENT OF PAIN WITH OPIOIDS AND OF OPIOID DEPENDENCE HAS CHANGED RADICALLY. CALLING INTO QUESTION OUR OUR CURRENT METHODS OF DEALING WITH OPIOID DEPENDENCE. THERE ARE ALSO. INDIVIDUALS IN CALIFORNIA WITH CHRONIC PAIN. I ESTIMATE. INTO THOUGH WELL INTO THE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS AND PERHAPS A MILLION. UP FOR WHOM OPIOID TREATMENT OUT MAYBE. APPROPRIATE. I SCRUTINY BY THE DA AND PROFESSIONAL ORGANIZATIONS OF POSSESSIONS. WHO PRESCRIBE OPIOIDS HAS CREATED AN ATMOSPHERE OF FEAR? AMONG PRESCRIBERS IN RESPONSE MANY PHYSICIANS HAVE ABRUPTLY CUT OFF THEIR CHRONIC PAIN PATIENTS WHO ARE OPIOID DEPENDENT. OUT LEAVING THEM WITH NO RECOURSE BUT TO SEEK THERAPY LIGHTS ON THE STREET. I EITHER BY TURNING TO HER ONE OR BY PURCHASING. ARE READILY AVAILABLE MEDICAL OPIOIDS FROM DEALERS. FINALLY ARE THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF HEROIN USERS IN CALIFORNIA. CRUCIFIXION CAUSES UNTOLD MISERY. RESULTS IN A LARGE PROPORTION OF CRIMINAL CRIMINAL BEHAVIOR. AND COST CALIFORNIANS BILLIONS OF DOLLARS EACH YEAR FOR TREATMENT LAW ENFORCEMENT AND INCARCERATION. FEWER THAN ONE IN TEN OF THESE INDIVIDUALS HAS ACCESS TO APPROPRIATE. MANAGEMENT OF OPIOID DEPENDENCE. AMBITIOUS FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS. LACK OF AVAILABILITY OF PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS WILLING TO OBTAIN THE DATA TWO THOUSAND WEAVER. WHICH ALLOWS US TO PRESCRIBE BUPRENORPHINE EXCELLENT TREATMENT FOR OPIOID DEPENDENCE. AND RESTRICTIONS PLACED ON PRESCRIBERS BY THE D. E. A.. AND FIVE SAMSUNG. CALIFORNIA HAS LEAD TO FIELD WITH LEGALIZATION DISTRIBUTION OF NOW WALKS HOME. FOR THE TREATMENT OF OPIOID. WE LEAD THE WAY AND IT'S WORKING. DATA TO THOUSAND OR THE X. WAIVER ALLOWS PRIMARY CARE AND OTHER MEDICAL PROVIDERS. HE PRESCRIBED PEOPLE OR SEEN MEDICATION ASSISTED TREATMENT. OUT FOR OPIOID USE DISORDER WHETHER IT BE HEROIN. OR WHETHER IT BE MEDICALLY INDUCED. OPIATE DEPENDENCE SUCH AS I HAVE CAUSED THROUGHOUT MY CAREER. AN INTERESTING ASIDE. EIGHTY PERCENT OF CHRONIC PAIN PATIENTS WHO MIGHT HAVE TREATED FOR THEIR OPIOID USE DISORDER AND THEIR PAIN WHICH PEOPLE ARE FINE. SAY THAT THEIR PAIN CONTROL IS BETTER ON PEOPLE ARE FEELING DOWN ON ANY OTHER OPIOID REGIMEN. THEY HAVE BEEN PRESCRIBED IN THE PAST. PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS ARE NOT PREPARING THEMSELVES FOR DATA TWO THOUSAND. AND THAT'S WHERE THIS BILL COMES IN THEY WOULD BE MOTIVATED TO DO SO. THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES HAS BRILLIANTLY AND PRO ACTIVELY. CREATED A PROGRAM CALLED HUB AND SPOKE. BUPRENORPHINE SYSTEM THAT IS READY AND WAITING TO CARRY OUT TO HIM IMPLEMENTATION. OUT OF THIS LEGISLATION. IN CONCLUSION. A WORD ABOUT THE OPPOSITION TO THIS LEGISLATION IT'S LIKELY TO COME FROM ORGANIZED MEDICINE ARE PROFESSIONAL SOCIETIES. WHO WILL CLAIM THAT IT PLACES AN UNDUE BURDEN ON MEDICAL PROVIDERS IT WILL COME FROM PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES? IN SUBTLE AND OBLIQUE FORM WHO STAND TO LOSE SALES OF OPIOIDS. IT MAY COME FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT ENTITIES. WHO BELIEVE THAT? FROM OPIOIDS IS THE BEST AND ONLY SOLUTION TO OPIOID USE DISORDER. AND PUNISHMENT AND INCARCERATION. OUR OUR MORE APPROPRIATE APPROACHES. THESE VESTED INTEREST GROUPS ARE POLITICALLY POWERFUL. THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE HAS RESISTED THEIR INFLUENCE IN THE PAST. AND SHOULD DO SO NOW FOR THE HEALTH AND WELFARE OF ALL CALIFORNIANS. I URGE YOU TO PROMOTE LEGISLATION THAT WILL MOTIVATE PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS TO INCREASE THEIR KNOWLEDGE OF THE CAUSES AND TREATMENT OF OPIOID USE DISORDER. THANK YOU NEXT WAS IF YOU BE BRIEFLY OF UP TO MEET OUR SPEAKER THANK YOUNG SUCH OUR MEMBERS ARE TOM RENT FREE WITH THE CALIFORNIA BEHAVIOR HEALTH DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION. WE'RE ALL WELL AWARE NOW THAT THE. PURE EPIDEMIC IS A PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS OVER TWO THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS ARE DYING EVERY YEAR. OF OPIOID. OVERDOSES I STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT MEDICATIONS FOR ADDICTION TREATMENT SUCH AS BUPRENORPHINE IN COMBINATION WITH COUNSELING OR BEHAVIORAL INTERVENTIONS. ARE THE MOST EFFECTIVE INTERVENTION FOR OPIOID USE DISORDERS UNFORTUNATELY PROVIDERS TRAIN TO EFFECTIVELY TREAT ADDICTION WITH THESE MEDICATIONS ARE VERY IN VERY SHORT SUPPLY. CALIFORNIA HAS FEWER THAN TWENTY EIGHT HUNDRED POSITIONS AUTHORIZED TO PRESCRIBE BUPRENORPHINE. AND MANY OF THESE PROVIDERS. DECLINED TO TREAT PATIENTS WITH OPIE OR DISORDERS OUT OF CONCERN THAT THEIR TRAINING IN ADDICTION MEDICINE IS INADEQUATE. THIS MEANS THAT FEWER THAN FIFTY PERCENT OF THOSE ADDICTED TO OPIOIDS ACTUALLY HAVE ACCESS TO A PHYSICIAN TRAINED TO PRESCRIBE THIS LIFESAVING MEDICATION. WE HEAR REPORTS FROM COUNTIES THAT MANY PATIENTS WHO ARE ARE PRESCRIBED OPIOIDS AND THEN BECOME ADDICTED THAT THE POSITION IS THEN THAT THEY'VE HAD IS NOT. ABLE TO TREAT THEM NOT BECAUSE OF STATEMENT NECESSARILY BUT JUST BECAUSE THE POSITION DOESN'T FEEL LIKE THEY'VE BEEN ADEQUATELY TRAINED IN IN YOU THE USE OF THESE MEDICATIONS. AND SO THAT LEAVES THESE PATIENTS THAN ARE SCRAMBLING TO FIND OUT FIND SOME HELP LIKE I SAY MANY OF THEM ARE NOT ABLE TO DO SO. THE. THIS BILL AB TWENTY FOUR EIGHTY SEVEN TAKES THEM OUT ACTION TO ENSURE THAT MORE CALIFORNIA POSITIONS HAVE THE KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS NEEDED TO RESPOND TO THE OPIOID EPIDEMIC. IN THEIR COMMUNITIES AND FOR THESE REASONS WE URGE YOUR SUPPORT OF THAT COALITION AWARENESS IS IN SUPPORT. GOOD MORNING SHOW GIVENS AT THE COUNTY HEALTH EXECUTIVES ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU ALL THE WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. CHRIS READ OF THE CULPRIT IS WILL THERE BE ASSOCIATION WERE IN SUPPORT OF WHAT WE LOOK FOR TO TALK WITH THE AUTHORS OFFICE. ABOUT INCLUSION OF A NON PHARMACOLOGICAL EDUCATION AS WELL. ISSUE ONE THIS IS A SPORT. SEEING NONE WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. COME UP AREA TWO MINUTES FIRST I THINK MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS MAKE IT ALRIGHT ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION. WE REALLY DO APPRECIATE THE AMENDMENTS THAT THE AUTHOR HAS TAKEN AND THAT THIS COMMITTEE HAS WORKED ON. AND THEY DO MOVE THE BILL EMIGRATE DIRECTION. WE ARE STILL CONCERNED HOWEVER THAT THE. AMENDMENT STILL REQUIRE EVERYBODY WITH A D. A LICENSE TO TAKE THIS MANDATORY EIGHT HOUR TRAINING CLASSES I'M SPECIFIC TO PEOPLE OFTEN. AT. ANYBODY WITH THE D. A. NUMBER CAN. AB SORRY DE EIGHT NUMBERS REQUIRED TO PRINT PRESCRIBE CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES. WHICH ARE FAR GREATER IN NUMBER THAN JUST OPIOIDS SO THERE ARE A WHOLE HOST OF POSITIONS THAT WOULD BE REQUIRED TO TAKE THIS THAT WILL NEVER NECESSARILY USE THIS TRAINING. WILL NEVER GO ON TO FILE FOR THE WAIVER TO ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO PRESCRIBE IT. AND WORK IN A FIELD ENTIRELY DIFFERENT. SO I. I THINK THAT'S A LITTLE FLEXIBILITY WOULD. BE APPRECIATED I AM AS OPPOSED TO A IN MANDATORY TRAINING CLASS. AB BUT OTHERWISE WE APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S I'M INTENT TO ENABLE MORE PHYSICIANS TO PRESCRIBE THIS TO. EDUCATE OUR POSITIONS ON THE ABILITY ARE ON. AT PRESCRIBING FOR SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS AND WE WOULD URGE. INCENTIVE BASED. LEGISLATION TO. TO PROVIDE TO GET MORE AB PROVIDERS INTO THAT. AREA OF SPECIALTY IF THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR BUT I THINK THE MANDATORY TRAINING COURSES JUST THAT. THE WRONG DIRECTION. AS IT'S WRITTEN BUT WE DO APPRECIATE THE AMENDMENTS WOULD CONTINUE TO. FOR TO WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR. THANK YOU. BRENT SPENCER WITH THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OBG WANES AND WE WOULD LIKE TO ALSO THINK THE AUTHOR FOR THE MAINTENANCE AND HIM WORKING WITH THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY. LIKE TO ECHO CMA'S AND CONCERNS AS WELL AND AGAIN JUST REITERATE WE'RE NOT POSTED EDUCATION AT ALL WE'RE SUPPOSED TO THE MANDATE OF THE EDUCATION IN FACT. A COG. ACTUALLY HAS ITS OWN MEDICATED. A MEDICATION ASSISTED TREATMENT COURSE OFFERS FOUR HOURS ONLINE AND FOUR HOURS IN PERSON TRAINING ON ON THIS EXACT TYPE OF. COURSE AND SO WE UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF IT AND WE DO ENCOURAGE OUR PHYSICIANS TO DO IT IS JUST A MANDATING SUPPLY DEMAND IT OF ANY TYPE OF TEANECK MET. MEDICAID MEDICAL EDUCATION IS OF CONCERN TO US THANK YOU. THANK YOU ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS WHERE TOP ON BEHALF OF BIO COM UM WE HAVE AN OPPOSING LESS AMENDED POSITION ON THE BILL IT'S FOR A VERY NARROW. POINTS IN THE BILL WERE ACTUALLY QUITE APPRECIATIVE OF WHAT THE AUTHOR IS TRYING TO DO HERE I WOULD JUST NOTE THAT THERE ARE MULTIPLE A THERAPEUTIC MODALITIES AND THAT ARE RECOGNIZED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THIS BILL ONLY IDENTIFIES ONE OF THEM. ON THEIR COULD BE ONES DEVELOPED IN THE FUTURE THAT WE THINK THEY MIGHT EVEN BE MORE EFFICACIOUS AND WE THINK THAT. THEY SHOULD ALSO BE IDENTIFIED IN THE DUST WOULD LIKE THE AUTHOR TO I CONSIDER THOSE POINTS AS THE BILL MOVES FORWARD THINK YOU. IN ADDITION WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. SEE NO ADDITIONAL WITNESSES OPPOSITION ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS AT THIS TIME. ASSEMBLY WOMAN EGGMAN. THANK YOU THANK YOU OUT OF. THIS RECORD AND I APOLOGIZE I WASN'T HERE WORLD JUMPING AROUND OF MULTIPLE COMMITTEES. THIS TIME A YEAR. OF WHAT WAS IS BASED UPON THE THE SITE IDEA OF EIGHT HOURS TRAINING MANDATORY TRAINING. WELL IN THAT IN CALIFORNIA. PHYSICIANS ARE ABLE TO PRESCRIBE. A PAINKILLER OXY COTTON'S SO FORTH BUT IF AN INDIVIDUAL CELLS UP AT THE ER. OR A CLINIC AND IS A HEROIN ADDICT YOU'RE ADDICTED TO OPIOIDS AND THEY WANT TO BE PRESCRIBED. HAVE DEEPENED AFTER IN A LOW LEVEL OPIOID TO GET OFF OF THEIR ADDICTION THEY'RE NOT ABLE TO DO SO UNLESS THEY HAVE THIS LICENSE. AND SO THAT THIS WOULD FOCUS ON. THE. THE TRAINING THAT INDIVIDUALS HAVE TO GO THROUGH WITH WHEN THEY GET THERE MEDICAL SCHOOL TRAINING AND PICK AND FORGET CONTINUED EDUCATION. PRESENT NOTED THAT WE WEREN'T FOR NARROWING IT. TO FOCUS ON THOSE WHO ARE JUST GETTING THEIR THEIR DE A. UP LICENSE THAT THRESHOLD AND WE WE DO HEAR THE THE CONCERNS AND MAYBE WE CAN LOOK AT. FURTHER FOCUSING ON THOSE WHO ARE JUST GOING TO BE. DESCRIBING. YOU KNOW PAINKILLERS SINCE AND THE SCHEDULED DRUGS. OKAY. I AM. I I I I AM NOT ONE WHO LOVES MANDATORY TRAININGS AND IT WAS A BILL LAST YEAR FOR THERAPIST TO GO THROUGH MANDATORY TRAINING TO DEALING WITH SUICIDE. ON THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT YOU DO WITH IT ANYWAY AND TO. ESTIMATED THERE POSTED MORE TRAINING OR SOMETHING THERE TRAINED IN THIS MAKING SENSE TO ME SO ANYTIME I SEE MANDATORY TRAINING IS COMING FROM. NO NON PROVIDER OF UP THAT THAT IT MAKES ME NERVOUS SO I'LL BE WATCHING THIS AS IT GOES FORWARD UP AND SING BUT DID YOU NARROW IT TO TO TO NOT BE AS BROAD BASED MAKING EVERYBODY TAKEN EIGHT HOUR TRAINING COURSE. AND MAKE SURE THAT THAT THE CAREER IS IN THE CURRICULUM ALREADY ESTABLISHED IN PROVIDED SOMEWHERE IT IT'S ALL IT'S ALSO OPERATE. OKAY. VICE CHAIR BURLINGTON ASSEMBLYMAN JUST A QUICK COMMENT NOW THANK YOU ALSO FOR WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION AND I HOPE YOU CAN NEED TO SOLICIT. THEY DO VERY MUCH FASTER SOMEONE BAKER THANK YOU AND I AND THE SAME QUESTION AND ONCE IMPRESSIONS. DOCTOR EGGMAN BUT THE THE QUESTION IS WHY EIGHT HOURS MY AT SIX TEN ONE TWO WHAT WORDS COME WITH EIGHT. I BELIEVE THAT THAT THAT IS THE STRUCTURE TO IT TO GET THE JOB. LICENSES AT EIGHT OUR PROGRAM DOCTOR FLYNN. THAT'S CORRECT ARM HOWEVER FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE OF THE BELL. IT MIGHT BE MORE APPROPRIATE TO HAVE A MUCH SHORTER. DISCRETION TO. AND PHYSICIANS WHO ARE NOT PLANNING TO OUR GIVE GIVE AND I THINK THAT THEY NEED TO BE AWARE THAT IT TAKES. OKAY THANK YOU SO I GUESS I'M STRAIGHT STARS THAT BECAUSE THAT'S THE STRUCTURE I ARMENIANS AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO GET THE X. WAIVER TO PRESCRIBE THIS YOU HAVE TO HAVE EIGHT HOURS OF TRAINING SO IT'S BASED. OKAY. IN ORDER TO GET THE T. A CERTIFICATION. NOR TO GET THE AXE WAIVER TO PRESCRIBE ANY OF THESE CUBAN EFFORT OKAY TREATMENT EFFORT THANK YOU AND SAM I I APPRECIATE THAT THAT'S THE FEDERAL. REQUIREMENTS AT FIVE ALSO APPRECIATE THE OPENING THAT WHEN YOU'RE WITNESSES MAY WHICH IS IT'S POSSIBLE THAT IN ADDITION TO NARROWING THE SCOPE. TO THOSE WHO ARE ACTUALLY GOING TO BE PRESCRIBING. YOU MAY ALSO CONSIDER NARROWING THE AMOUNT OF TIME. IT'S NECESSARY BECAUSE WHEN I LOOK AT THIS I SEE BIG TWENTY HOURS OF. CONTINUING EDUCATION REQUIRED IF I'M CORRECT ABOUT THAT AND WE'RE LOOKING AT NOW ST ALMOST HALF OF THAT. HAS TO BE IN ONE PARTICULAR AREA. AND I KNOW THAT DOCTORS ARE LOSE TO BE COMPARED TO LAWYERS BUT WE. WE HAVE CONTINUING EDUCATION AS WELL IN FOR ELIMINATING BIAS IN THE PROFESSION AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND OTHERS BUT. THE WHAT LET'S SAY THAT WE HAD A PROBLEM WITH THAT. PATENT LAW AND I HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH PAT LA I DON'T PRACTICE IT IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT I DO BUT I'VE GOT TO TAKE EIGHT HOURS WHICH IS. ALMOST HALF OF THEIR OVERALL TIME AS OPPOSED TO SOMETHING I MIGHT REALLY THINK AYE I DESPERATELY NEED OR WITH BENEFIT FROM. ADDITIONAL. TRAINING AND ARE OR CONTINUING EDUCATION AND FINDING THAT THIS COULD BE VERY VERY RIGID AND EIGHT HOURS IS A LOT WHEN IT'S A HALF OF THE REQUIREMENT. SO AND I LIKE A DOCTOR EGGMAN I THINK IN OTHERS. VERY MUCH APPRECIATE WHERE YOU'RE GOING WITH THIS I STRONGLY ENCOURAGE THAT LOOKING AT CERTAIN NARROWING THIS TO HAVE MORE TARGETED FOCUSED SENATE DOCTORS TO HIM THIS WOULD APPLY AND PERHAPS THE AMOUNT OF TIME. SO THAT WE ARE MAKING SURE THAT PHYSICIANS ARE ABLE TO. MEET THEIR HOURS IN OTHER AREAS THAT WE REALLY REALLY WANT THEM TO TAKING CLEAN AS EMERGENCY PHYSICIANS THAT YOU'RE REFERRING TO. SWEET WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT EVERY TIME THERE AND AN HOUR AWAY FROM PROVIDING MEDICAL CARE A THAT PROVIDE IT BE THERE PROBABLY NOT BEING PAID. TO TAKE THE EDUCATION AND THAT'S. HOW THEY ALSO MAINTAIN THEIR PRACTICES SO? PUBLIC THAT CAN BE DONE IN FUTURE ITERATIONS OF THE BILL IS THE ONLY CHANCE I MEAN TO SEE IT FOR HITS THE FLOOR SICKENING MAKE SURE THAT'S. EXPRESSED VERY. DOCTOR AND. I WANTED TO START BY. WELCOMING YOU TO THIS COMMITTEE. I'VE HAD THE PLEASURE OF GOING UP TO BUTTE COUNTY WITH YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER MCCARTY WHERE WE TALKED ABOUT A FEW. FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO MAY NOT KNOW ON THE COMMITTEE I'VE IN THE. PREVIOUS TO COMING HERE ACTUALLY HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK ATA METHADONE CLINIC WHERE WE WERE ABLE TO PRESCRIBE MANY MEDICATIONS. THAT CAN HELP THOSE WHO ARE GOING THROUGH ADDICTION AND RECOVERY AS WE ARE NOW. AND AS A CURRENT DA HOLDER I WAS PARTICULARLY INTERESTED IN THIS BILL. BUT I SHARE THE CONCERNS THAT DOCTOR EGGMAN DOES ANY TIME WE'RE HAVING INDIVIDUAL LEGISLATORS BRING FORWARD. CONTINUING MEDICAL EDUCATION THAT'S NOT SUPPORTED BY THE MEDICAL BOARD THAT FOR. SOME OTHER. EXTERNAL VALIDATOR THAT MAKES SURE THAT THE CONTINUING MEDICAL EDUCATION IS JERRY. PARTICULARLY I WANTED TO FOCUS OF I COULD ON THE WORDS OF YOUR WITNESS HIS WORDS WERE MOTIVATE. BUT THE WORDS ON THE BILL ARE MANDATE. AND AS WE ARE NOW ANY DE A HOLDER IS ABLE TO IF THEY SO CHOOSE. TO DO THESE EIGHT HOURS OF CONTINUING MEDICAL EDUCATION IS AND TO RECEIVE THE SEX LICENSE. BUT THE VAST MAJORITY OF PHYSICIANS ACROSS OUR STATE FOR. GOOD REASONS AND BAD REASONS HAVE NOT SELECTED TO DO SO. I AM UNCOMFORTABLE WITH THE CURRENT WAY THE BILL IS FRAMED BECAUSE IT WOULD. REQUIRE ALL PHYSICIANS AND SURGEONS ACROSS OUR STATE TO UNDER GO. AT EIGHT HOURS OF CONTINUING MEADOW WILL GO EDUCATION THAT MIGHT NOT APPLY TO THEIR DAILY PRESS. AND WILL ECHO THE COMMENTS OF WANTING THIS BILL TO BE NARROWED OR TO BE. AND A SUCH A RECOMMENDATION AND OR TO COME FROM THE MEDICAL BOARD ITSELF SO THAT WERE INSURED THAT THE. BEST PRACTICES OF TODAY ARE THE ACTUAL EVIDENCE THAT WE'RE USING TO BASE OUR LEGISLATION. SO WITH THAT AGAIN JUST WANTED TO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD BUT. CAN'T SUPPORT THIS. ITS CURRENT FORM. A ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS AT THIS TIME. SEE NO QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS IT'S TIME ASSEMBLY WERE MCCARTY DO WE SHOULD CLOSE YES AGAIN. THANK YOU FOR THAT FOR THE FEED BACK INTO WORKING TO WORK WITH THEM. THOSE ISSUES THAT WERE RAISED BY COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND. YEAH IN OPPOSITION AND I THINK THE THAT THE NEXUS HERE IS THAT. IN THE CURRENT STRUCTURE THERE ARE NOT ENOUGH MEDICAL PROVIDERS WHO EITHER. WHO WHO KNOW ABOUT IT AND MAYBE THEY COULD BE INFORMED ABOUT IT THROUGH THEIR WHEN THEY GO TO YOU KNOW GET THEIR THEIR? LICENSE IN THE FIRST PLACE OR CONTINUING EDUCATION AS WELL. AND THIS CERTAINLY WAY I THINK I BENEFIT I CALIFORNIANS WHO UNFORTUNATELY ARE ADDICTED IT WOULD HELP WITH THAT THE CLINICS OUT THERE WHO DON'T HAVE ENOUGH MEDICAL PROVIDERS TO HELP IN THE FIRST PLACE. AND. CERTAINLY ASK YOUR AYE BUT TODAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AS A MCCARTY AND I ALSO KNOW THAT OUR OFFICES WORK WITH SOME LANGUAGE TO ADDRESS IN THIS CONCERNS IN THAT YOU'VE ALSO INDICATED. OF THE WILLINGNESS AND INTENT TO ALSO ADDRESS SOME OF THESE CONCERNS I SHOULD THIS BILL MOVE FORWARD.

I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE AND I'M ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE'S RECOMMENDED AMENDMENTS TO REMOVE LANGUAGE REGARDING A LOT IDENTIFICATION CARD FURNISHED BY THE BUREAU. THE GOAL OF AB TWENTY TWO FIFTY FIVE IS TO PROVIDE LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS WITH THE GUIDANCE. WHEN THEY ENCOUNTER A CANNABIS DISTRIBUTOR OR DELIVERY DRIVER. IT'S BILL AUTHORIZES AN OFFICER TO WRITE A CITATION OF A DISTRIBUTOR DOES NOT HAVE. A PHYSICAL MANIFEST WITH THEM OR IF THEY FAILED TO SUBMIT THE REQUIRED INFORMATION INTO TRACK AND TRACE. THE BILL ALSO AUTHORIZES THE CITATION OF THE LICENSEE DOES NOT HAVE THEIR DELIVERY REQUEST. UNDERCURRENT LAW LICENSEES ARE REQUIRED TO HAVE THESE ITEMS WHEN TRANSPORTING CANNABIS. THESE REQUIREMENTS OR BRIGHT LINE THE DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN LEGAL OPERATORS AND DOES BREAKING THE LAW. WE WANT OFFICERS TO BE CHECKING FOR THESE ITEMS SO THEY CAN EASILY DISTINGUISH BETWEEN WILL. A LICENSEE FOR ILLICIT ACTOR. SHAPE THAT WILL MOVE RIGHT ALONG. I DO HAVE A COUPLE SUPPORTERS HERE THAT I WANTED TO. INTRODUCE ALL TURN TO. SEAN RUNDLE OF THE CALIFORNIA PEACE OFFICERS ASSOCIATION AND REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE CANNABIS DISTRIBUTORS ASSOCIATION. DETERMINE BURST WITH THE. RECOMMENDATION THE VOTE I'LL BE BRIEF.

THE PENALTY IMPOSED ON THE FAILURE TO ACTUALLY HAVE A PHYSICAL COPY NUMBER ONE CURRENT REGULATIONS DO NOT REQUIRED OF PHYSICAL COPY IT DOES REQUIRE YOU TO HAVE AN ELECTRONIC COPY SO THAT'S A. AT LEAST A FIX IT WOULD BE SHOULD SHOULD BE MADE I'M IN THE LAW RELATIVE TO TO THAT REQUIREMENT. WE ALSO ARE CONCERNED ABOUT ADDING ADDITIONAL THINGS TO DISTRIBUTORS AT A TIME WHEN WE ARE NOW THREE AND A HALF MONTHS ALMOST FOUR MONTHS. INTO. INTO THIS NEW LAW. WE NEED TO TAKE TIME TO MAKE SURE THAT WHAT THE VOTERS APPROVED AND TWENTY SIXTEEN AND WHAT YOU WAS LEGISLATURE APPROVED LAST YEAR. THE GET SETTLED LONG LETTERS FIGURE OUT WHAT THEY'RE WHAT THE PROBLEM. MAY BE AND HOW AND HOW WE MIGHT FIX THOSE IF THEY DO ARISE. WE DO KNOW THAT THERE IS SUBSTANTIAL ENFORCEMENT RESPONSIBILITY I'M PUT ON THE BUREAU OF CANNABIS CONTROL. ON THERE IS NO INDICATION AT THIS POINT THAT THERE ENFORCEMENT ABILITY. IS NOT GETTING AT THE ISSUE OF DISTRIBUTORS WHO ARE FAILING TO MEET THEIR OBLIGATION AND THEIR SUBSTANTIAL PENALTIES INCLUDING THE REVOCATION OF THE LICENSE THAT ALREADY EXIST.

IF I COULD BE A KIND WE ASK THEM FOR THE PUBLIC JUST MY LIMITED ONE MINUTE A PIECE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I'D. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHIU FOR INTRODUCING AB THIRTY THIRTEEN. OF MY NAME IS KAREN OUT LISTS AND I AM A LICENSED BE TEAM CALIFORNIA AND I HAVE BEEN SO FOR THE LAST TWENTY YEARS. I SPEAK TO YOU AS THE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE SPONSOR. AS AND ON ON BEHALF OF THE MANY THOUSANDS OF CONSUMERS SEEKING ACCESS TO HIGH LEVEL WELL REGULATED ANIMAL FISCAL REHABILITATION FOR THEIR COMPANION ANIMALS. TO CLARIFY I WOULD LIKE TO STATE THAT THEY. PT BOARD AND THE VET BOARD WILL BE WORKING TOGETHER DETERMINE COMPETENCY STANDARDS FOR. WHAT THE ADDITIONAL TRAINING AND CERTIFICATION WOULD LOOK LIKE IN THIS STATE? THE CURRICULUM FOR PHYSICAL THERAPISTS I'M IT WOULD BE IS TO. I HAVE AN UNDERGRADUATE DEGREE AS WELL AS A THREE YEAR CLINICAL DOCTORATE DEGREE AND WE ARE NOT SAYING THAT JUST BECAUSE YOU HAVE THOSE QUALIFICATIONS THAT IT WOULD ALLOW YOU TO WORK ON ANIMALS WE DO. RECOGNIZE THE NEED TO HAVE ADDITIONAL TRAINING AND SO INCOMES THAT. CERTIFICATION FOR. FOR THIS SPECIALTY OF PRACTICE. I AM. AT THIRTY THIRTEEN MANDATES THAT THE. THAT THE VETERINARIANS RETAIN FINAL CONTROL OVER HOW ANIMALS READ RECEIVE ANIMAL REHAB. THERAPY AND. AND THEY GET TO DECIDE IF THE ANIMAL IS SUITED TO BEING TREATED AND NOT CITING AND UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS. THE ANIMAL REHAB THERAPISTS WOULD BE MANDATED TO REPORT REGULARLY TO THE REFERRING VETERINARIAN HOWEVER IT IS IMPORTANT TO KNOW. THAT THE ANIMAL REHAB THERAPISTS WOULD RETAIN LIABILITY FOR THE TREATMENT OF THE ANIMAL NOT THE VETERINARIAN JUST DOESN'T CASE OF HUMAN MEDICINE BENQ. CHAIRMAN LOW AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO SPEAK. MY NAME IS JANET VAN* I'M A VETERINARIAN WITH OVER THIRTY YEARS EXPERIENCE. AS A SURGEON OWNING AND OPERATING REFERRAL SURGICAL PRACTICES IN NEW YORK CITY AND CHICAGO. I'M ALSO THE FOUNDER OF THE CANINE REHABILITATION INSTITUTE. I STARTED IN TWO THOUSAND TWO AND WHERE I REMAIN AS THE CEO. I'VE BEEN INVOLVED IN THIS DISCUSSION IN CALIFORNIA SINCE BROKE TWO THOUSAND SEVEN WHEN I WAS FIRST ASKED TO CONSULT FOR SOME COMMITTEES DISCUSSING. COLLABORATION BETWEEN PT'S AND VETERINARIANS WHO IS ALSO A MEMBER OF THE ANIMAL REHABILITATION TASK FORCE THAT CONCLUDED OUR WORK LAST YEAR. IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN I WAS INVOLVED WITH COLORADO'S LEGISLATIVE CHANGE TO THE VETERINARY PRACTICE ACT THEY'RE USING LANGUAGE VERY SPECIFIC AND VERY SIMILAR TO THE ONE THAT'S BEING DISCUSSED TODAY. THAT MODEL HAS WORKED SO WELL IN COLORADO. WE'VE HAD ZERO PUBLIC COMPLAINTS SINCE IT WAS PASSED IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN. WE'VE WATCHED ENORMOUS EXPANSION OF THIS INDUSTRY IN COLORADO EMPLOYING VETERINARIANS VETERINARY TECHNICIANS AND PHYSICAL THERAPISTS. AND ADDING NEW PRACTICES AND GROWING AND EXPANDING CURRENTLY EXISTING PRACTICES. THE DEMAND FOR THIS IS CLIENT DRIVEN AND THE VETERINARY PRACTICE IS NOW TRYING TO CATCH UP WITH THE DEMAND ON THE BETTER ON THE CLIENT SIDE. IT'S A POTENTIALLY LUCRATIVE FIELD AND I CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND WHY VETERINARIANS WHO PRACTICE IN THIS FIELD ALREADY IN CALIFORNIA MIGHT WANT TO PROTECT THEIR OWN REVENUE STREAMS. SEVERAL OF THEM ARE TRYING TO DO THIS BY PERSUADING THE LEGISLATURE TO DENY PHYSICAL THERAPISTS ACCESS. TO THIS PRACTICE OUTSIDE OF THESE VETERINARIANS OWN PRACTICES. CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE IN THE CALIFORNIA VETERINARY MEDICAL BOARD ARE TASKED WITH PROTECTING THE PUBLIC. NEITHER IS IN A POSITION TO BENEFIT THE FEW OF PEOPLE'S INCOME STREAM AT THE COST TO THE PUBLIC. THE THEORY IS NOT A VOTE YES ON THIS BILL THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES WISHING TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT NAME INNOVATIONS OF FOR THE RECORD IF YOU WISH TO DO SO. DANIEL ROBBINS AND EVERY HAVE PRACTITIONER IN SUPPORT. SCHLUP ARE MEMBER OF THE TASK FORCE THAT. WAS THE V. NBA WE WORKED REALLY HARD FOR A YEAR TO COME UP WITH SOME LANGUAGE.

DR JAMES SIMS PHYSIOTHERAPIST DOCTOR SCIENCE AND MEMBER OF THE. ANIMAL REHABILITATION TASK FORCE. AND WHICH CAME OUT WITH A SIMILAR RECOMMENDATION OF THIS BILL A BASED ON THE EVIDENCE THAT IS OUT THERE TO SUPPORT THIS SITE DEVELOPMENTS THIS IS NOT AN OPINION THIS IS THE EVIDENCE THAT SUPPORTS IT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SEEING NO ADDITIONAL WITNESSES WISHING TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT. OF A NOW LIKE TO ASK MEMBERS THAT WISHING TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION PLEASE FEEL FREE TO COME UP AT THE THE TYSON. YOU ALSO HAVE UP TO THREE MINUTES IN TOTAL. IN OPPOSITION PLEASE WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS I CRISTINA CARO WITH THE CALIFORNIA VETERINARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION ALL BE VERY BRIEF JUST WANTED TO INDICATE THAT THE AMENDMENTS THAT THE AUTHOR SAYS HAS TAKEN TODAY DO NOT REMOVE OUR OPPOSITION BUT WE REALLY DO WANT TO THANK. THIS COMMITTEE ALL THE TIME YOU SPENT WITH US EVERY SINGLE MEMBER AND THE OFFICIAL SITE BOTH SIDES REALLY APPRECIATE I'D LIKE TO INTRODUCE DR AARON TRIED. THANK YOU CHAIR COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS DOCTOR AARON TROY AIKMAN PRACTICING VETERINARY MEDICINE IN ONE THE CREEK FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS ENAMEL PHYSICAL REHABILITATION FOR EIGHTEEN. OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS I TO HAVE PARTICIPATED IN THIS PROCESS. AND THE OUTCOME HAS BEEN THAT PATIENT SAFETY WAS MOST IMPORTANT AND REQUIRES ONSITE VETERINARY SUPERVISION. I'M HERE TODAY SPEAKING OPPOSITION TO THIRTY THIRTEEN BECAUSE IT DOES A TREMENDOUS DISSERVICE TO CONSUMERS. VETERINARIANS AND MOST IMPORTANTLY IT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO DO GREAT HARM TO OUR PETS. VETERINARY MEDICINE HAS A VERY DIFFERENT CARE DELIVERY MODEL IN HUMAN MEDICINE WE PRACTICE ON MULTIPLE DIFFERENT SPECIES WE CARE FOR PATIENTS FROM BIRTH UNTIL DEATH. AND NONE OF OUR PATIENTS SPEAK. OFTEN THE REASON ANIMALS BROUGHT INTO S. IS NOT THE REAL PROBLEM AND WE HAVE TO BE PREPARED TO CHANGE DIRECTIONS AT A MOMENT'S NOTICE AND CAREFULLY AND COMPASSIONATELY EDUCATE THE CLIENT. WE ARE EDUCATED AND TRAINED TO READ X. RAYS INTERPRET LAB RESULTS RECOGNIZE SUBTLE CHANGES IN OUR PATIENTS HEALTH STATUS INCLUDING THEIR PAIN. ACCESS IS NOT AN ISSUE IT IS CONTINUING EVERY YEAR THERE ARE MORE ANIMAL PHYSICAL PUT ROTATION REHABILITATION PROFESSIONALS IN CALIFORNIA. THAN THERE ARE VETERINARY OPHTHALMOLOGIST AND VETERINARY DENTIST COMBINED. THEY'RE NOT ONLY REFERRAL PRACTICES EXCLUSIVELY OFFER REHABILITATION BUT A GROWING NUMBER OF PRACTICE IT PRACTICES THAT OFFER DIFFERENT LEVELS. I URGE YOU TO VOTE NO ONE THIRTY THIRTEEN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WITH THIRTY SECONDS LEFT. THANK YOU I'M DOCTOR SURE WATERHOUSE I AM THE PRESIDENT OF THE VETERAN MEDICAL BOARD AND ALSO SMALLER PRACTITIONER AT A PRACTICE IN FRESNO. THE PHYSICAL AND THE BETTER A MEDICAL BOARD HAS DEBATED AND. DEBATED TO DELIBERATE THIS ISSUE FOR OVER SEVEN YEARS AND WE CAME OUT STRONGLY A FIVE TO TO VOTE TO VOTE LIKE HAVE TO OPPOSE. THE PHYSICAL THERAPISTS WORKING INDEPENDENTLY FROM A VENDOR AND WE BELIEVE THAT THEY NEED DIRECT SUPERVISION OF A VETERINARIAN WHAT PHYSICAL THERAPISTS DO OF IN YOUR PRACTICE THAT REFORM AND THE PHYSICAL REHABILITATION IS ONLY PART. OF WHAT A PATIENT NEEDS IN ADDITION TO REHABILITATION. PATIENTS UNDERGOING VARIOUS REVISIONS RECEIVE A PHYSICAL EXAM HAVE PAIN MEDICATIONS EVALUATED HOUSE BANDAGES CHANGE HAVE SPLIT CHANGED AB OTHER MODALITIES SUCH AS EAST FAMILIES AT THEIR PURE ACUPUNCTURE. ALL THESE ARE CRITICAL FOR THE CARE OF THE PATIENT THERE IS PRECEDENT WHO ARE YOU DOING IN ADOPTING THE DIRECT SUPERVISION REGULATIONS. BBC SECTION TWO ZERO THREE EIGHT REQUIRES PER PRACTICE TO WORK UNDER THE DIRECT SUPERVISION OF AN AREA WHEN PERFORMING MUSCULAR MANIPULATION ON ANIMALS. THIS STRUCTURE HAS WORKED WELL FOR OVER TWENTY YEARS. THIS BILL UNDERMINES EVERYTHING THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS STANDS FOR AS FAR AS LICENSING REGULATION AND CONSUMER PROTECTION. IT UNDERMINES THE VETERAN MEDICINE PRACTICE ACT AND WE REQUIRE EXTENSIVE RENT OF REVISIONS IN MULTIPLE SECTIONS. THE BOARD BELIEVES THIS LEGISLATION WHEN GREATLY MISLEAD THE PUBLIC THE AMMO PHYSICAL REHABILITATION FACILITY THAT WOULD BE OPERATE BY PHYSICAL THERAPIST INDEPENDENTLY OF ANY VETERAN OVERSIGHT WOULD HAVE A PREMISES PERMIT POSTED ON THE WALL. THAT WOULD BE FROM THE VETERAN MEDICAL BOARD GIVING THE CONSUMER THE IMPRESSION OTHER PEDALS UNDER SUPERVISION CARAVAN WRITING WHEN AFFECT THERE'S NO VETERINARIAN PRESENT AT ALL. SO IS IN THE BEST INTRAVENOUS AND THE CONSUMER TO CONTINUE TO HAVE VETERINARIANS. SUPERVISOR PRACTICE OF VETERINARY MEDICINE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. NINETY WITNESSES WISHING TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION PLEASE FEEL FREE TO COME TO THE MICROPHONE NAY MANIPULATION. IF YOU WISH TO DO SO. BUT NANCY EHRLICH REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA REGISTERED VETERINARY TECHNICIANS ASSOCIATION AND ALL THE OTHER PARTY TEES WHO COULD NOT BE HERE TODAY BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO WORK. WE. ARE TRAINED IN. AB TO RECOGNIZE AND TREAT EMERGENCIES WHEN A VETERINARIAN IS NOT PRESENT ON LIKE A PT AND WE ARE OPPOSING THIS BILL FOR THE. HEALTH WELL BEING AND SAFETY OF OUR PATIENTS. BROWN TO MONTAGUE I'M STUDENT AT UC DAVIS SCHOOL OF VETERINARY MEDICINE AND I STATE MY OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL. LARA I'M TRIAL ALSO A STUDENT AT UC DAVIS VETERINARY MEDICINE IN OPPOSITION OF THE SPELL. HI BRIANNA AND COUGH REGISTERED VETERINARY TECHNICIAN AND LUIS CALIFORNIA OF ON BEHALF OF ALL OF MY CO WORKERS AND CLASSMATES I COULD BE HERE TODAY WE STRONGLY OPPOSE THIS BILL. FOR THE SAKE OF THE PATIENTS AND FOR OUR PROFESSION IN THE FIELD IN GENERAL. ACTUALLY QUACKENBUSH REGISTERED VETERINARY TECHNICIAN AND AYE OPPOSED TO SPELL. VETERINARIANS THAT SPECIALIZE IN PHYSICAL THERAPY THEY CAN'T GO AND GET CERTIFICATIONS TO THEN WORK ON HUMANS SO WHY SHOULD HUMANS VERY PHYSICAL THERAPY GET FURTHER SPECIALIZATION TO WORK ON ANIMALS. IT'S DISCREDITING OR FIELD AND I POST SPELL. MY NAME IS KRISTEN HECKLER THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING US SPEAK TODAY I OPPOSE THIS BILL I'M A REGISTERED VETERINARY TECHNICIAN OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE ACADEMY OF PHYSICAL REHABILITATION VETERINARY TECHNICIANS. I OPPOSE THIS BILL BECAUSE IT WILL RESTRICT PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT FOR THE RVT IN CALIFORNIA. INFRINGES UPON PROTECT ANIMAL HEALTH CARE TASK ALREADY ESTABLISHED SORT OF CASTING SPLINTING EMBRACING AND CONTRIBUTES TO THE RVT SHORTAGE IN CALIFORNIA. IS A JOB IN PART OF RVT TRAINING TO RECOGNIZE AND REPORT PAINS TO LICENSED VETERINARIANS. RBT PRESENCE IN OPPOSITION WOULD BE LARGER HERE TODAY BUT AS ALREADY STATED WE ARE HAVING EXISTING SHORTAGE AND WE ARE REQUIRED TO BE IN OUR PROFESSIONAL HOSPITALS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. MY NAME IS DOCTOR JESSICA WALDMAN I AM OF REHABILITATION VETERINARIAN IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BEEN PRACTICING ONLY PET WE HAVE FOR THE PAST TEN YEARS. I OPPOSE THIS BILL BECAUSE I ACTUALLY WORK IN CONJUNCTION WITH PHYSICAL THERAPISTS OF MY PRACTICE YOU HAVE A WONDERFUL. THING TO ADD TO OUR FIELD BUT UNFORTUNATELY SAFETY IS NOT ONE OF THE THINGS ARE ABLE TO PROVIDE FOR OUR PETS. THROUGH PETS WITH CAESAR'S COLLAPSE ISSUES PAIN MEDICATION QUESTIONS THAT HAPPENED ALL DAY LONG FOR ME AND ALL MY COLLEAGUES IT JUST ISN'T FAIR TO PUT PETS IN THE SITUATION. WHERE THE PERSON SUPERVISING THEM IS UNABLE TO PROVIDE SAFETY FOR THEM? SO I URGE YOU TO PLEASE VOTE NO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE REMAINING IS BECAUSE IF YOU JUST NAME INFLATION PLEASE THANK YOU. BUT IT IS GENERAL PAYTON I'M AT THAT MARION BOARDED IN EMERGENCY IN CRITICAL CARE I'M ALSO THE CHIEF OF SERVICE FOR THE INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE. I'M SERVICE AT THE VETERINARY MEDICAL TEACHING HOSPITAL AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA DAVIS AND I STATE MY OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL. THINKING. GOOD MORNING JOHN PASCOE. BOARD CERTIFIED VETERINARY SURGEON EXECUTIVE ASSOCIATE DEAN OF THE SCHOOL OF VETERINARY MEDICINE LIKE REGISTRY OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. DR GRANT MILLER I'M A CALIFORNIA EQUINE PRACTITIONER THIS BILL IS NOT ABOUT. REVENUE STREAMS ABOUT PROTECTING ANIMALS WHICH IS WHY ASK YOUR OPPOSITION THANK YOU. VALERIE FENCED MAKER EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA VETERINARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION WE ARE OPPOSED TO THIS BILL. DOCTOR RICHARD SULLIVAN MEMBER OF THE VETERAN MEDICAL BOARD. A PRACTITIONER IN TORRANCE CALIFORNIA ITEM OF. RECORD OF A ASKED TO OPPOSE THIS BILL. KEVIN HAS A CHEF PRACTITIONER IN OAKHURST CALIFORNIA PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA BETTER MEDICAL ASSOCIATION WE ARE IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS AT THIS. TIME FOR ASSEMBLYMEMBER CHIU. A SIMILAR BAKER THANK YOU AND FIRST I AM. I I DON'T THINK THAT VETERINARIANS WHO OPPOSE THIS BILL DO BECAUSE A REVENUE STREAM SO I I JUST. OP WHICH WE SHOULD BE VERY CAREFUL ABOUT FOLKS TO SAY THAT BECAUSE THAT'S OFTEN THEM. SO I WOULD RESORT TO THAT ARGUMENT AGAINST A BILL ONLY IF IT'S REALLY SUBSTANTIAL. THEY'RE PROFESSIONALS AND THEY CARE ABOUT PATIENTS AND AND SO I JUST WANT TO GET THAT OUT THERE. AND THAT SAID IT MIGHT GIVE ME A QUESTION BE OPPOSITION BECAUSE WHEN I SEE THE AMENDMENTS THE AUTHORS TAKEN MY UNDERSTANDING IS IT ACTUALLY INCREASES THE CONTROL OF VETERINARIANS HAVE OVER WHETHER OR NOT IT'S ON SITE OFF SITE DIRECT INDIRECT. THE AMENDMENTS TAKE CARE OF CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF. CONCERNS THAT I SHARED THAT YOU ARTICULATED AND I THINK WELL. WHERE IS THAT STILL WITH THE AMENDMENTS TAKEN BECAUSE I'VE LOOKED AT THEM PRETTY CLOSELY INTO ME THAT HAS A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF? USUALLY WILL STILL HAVE A IT'S IMPORTANT THAT I THINK THE VETERINARIAN HAVING HAVE QUITE A BIT OF CONTROL OVER WHAT HAPPENS HERE I THINK THE MEMBERS ACCOMPLISH THAT I'M JUST LOOKING FOR THE WHOLE MISTER CHAIRMAN. USE IT IS BAKER WOULD LIKE TO HEAR FROM THE OFFICE OF THE FOR WE'VE EVER WE. YES. I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR FROM THE OPPOSITION ON THAT ONE I KNOW THERE'S ONE FROM ON THE CREEKS I PARTICULARLY. THINK PLEASE SORT. OF. SO FOR THE AMENDMENTS AND ACTUALLY IN SOME WAY THE LIMITS MAKE IT WORSE FROM ONE THEY ADD MOBILE SO NOW OF A P. R. RECALL AND A PHYSICAL REHABILITATION AB ARE CAN BE PRACTICED ANYWHERE. AND NOTHING IS THAT REDEFINES THE BETTER MEDICAL BOARDS. REGULATIONS INDIRECT SUPERVISION AT IS USED HERE IS NOT THE CORRECT TERM THIS IS NOT IN DIRECT SUPERVISION. THIS IS A PRACTICE BY REFERRAL SO INDIRECT SUPERVISION MEANS THAT THE VETERINARIAN. THE ANIMALS IN A PLACE WHERE THERE'S STILL A VETERINARIAN. THAT'S IN CHARGE OF VETERINARIAN THAT IT IS ON THE PREMISES OF VENDOR IN THAT'S RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS CASE SO THAT IS IN DIRECT SUPERVISION. WE TALK ABOUT IN DIRECT SUPERVISION WITH OUR OUR BEAUTY IS WHAT YOU'RE LIKE NURSES A WE DISK DESCRIBE AUTUMN IN DIRECT SUPERVISION WITH THEM SO THAT. WERE JUST CERTAIN PRACTICES FOR CERTAIN PROCEDURES. SO THAT WE CAN WE FOR GO FOR LUNCH FOR INSTANCE WE CAN WE FOR A FEW MONTHS AGO LUNCH SO THAT. OTHERWISE UNDER DIRECT SUPERVISION OF FOR AN RPG. HE YOU KNOW WHAT HAS TO STOP WHEN WE WHEN WE LEAVE THE BUILDING AND CAMERA RETURN AGAIN UNTIL WE GOT INTO THE BUILDING. BUT SO RVT IS I CAN'T WORK DO SOMETHINGS AND THEN THE PT IS GOING TO SAY WELL IT DIDN'T DIE FROM THE AP ARE THAT WE DID IT DIE FROM SOME UNDERLYING REASON. BUT THEN THE VETERINARIANS GONNA SAY HEY I'VE BEEN YOU'VE SEEN THIS ANIMAL FOR A MONTH OR THREE MONTHS OR SIX MONTHS. AND SO THERE'S GOING TO BE THIS BACK AND FORTH WHO'S REALLY RESPONSIBLE. AND AND WHAT THE VENDOR SHOULD BE RESPONSIBLE BECAUSE THEY HAVEN'T SEEN THIS ANIMAL FOR QUITE AWHILE IF THIS HAD BEEN DONE IN THE FACILITY THAT WHERE A VETERINARIAN WAS IN CHARGE. OF THEY WOULD HAVE SEEN WHEN SOMETHING WAS STARTING TO EMERGE. THANK YOU AND ARE DEFENDING. SO.
