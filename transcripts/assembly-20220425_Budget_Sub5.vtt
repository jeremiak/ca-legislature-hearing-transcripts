WAS IN THESYSTEM- AND WHILE I

00:31:35.293 --> 00:31:36.594

HIGHER EDUCATION PROGRAMS AND IT

00:31:40.431 --> 00:31:43.001

00:31:47.272 --> 00:31:48.940

IN THE SCHOOL TO PRISON

00:34:05.910 --> 00:34:08.579
PIPELINE- IN SCHOOL TO ME WAS

00:34:08.646 --> 00:34:10.581
THIS A PLACE WHERE I RECEIVED

00:34:10.648 --> 00:34:12.817
MORE PUNISHMENT IT WAS IT WAS A

00:34:12.884 --> 00:34:15.052
PUNITIVE SYSTEM- I ACTUALLY GOT

00:34:15.119 --> 00:34:17.555
INCARCERATED ON A SCHOOL CAMPUS-

00:34:17.622 --> 00:34:18.723
FROM BEING POLICED IN MY

00:34:18.790 --> 00:34:20.658
COMMUNITY AND BEING POLICE IN MY

00:34:20.725 --> 00:34:21.692
SCHOOL THAT ALL STARTED WITH A

00:34:21.759 --> 00:34:22.827
GETTING DETENTIONS AND

00:34:22.894 --> 00:34:24.529
SUSPENSIONS OR WHATEVER FOR.

00:34:24.595 --> 00:34:27.331
BEHAVIOR OR- GETTING TO FIGHTS

00:34:27.398 --> 00:34:28.433
LIKE THINGS THAT LITTLE BOYS DO

00:34:28.499 --> 00:34:30.668
RIGHT- WHICH LED ME TO BEING

TWO AND A HUNDRED TWENTY POUNDS-

00:34:35.740 --> 00:34:37.308
I THINK- NO CHILD SHOULD GO GO

00:34:37.375 --> 00:34:40.645
TO JAIL LIKE THAT- AND IT WASN'T

00:34:40.711 --> 00:34:42.547
UNTIL I CAME INTO. CONTACT THE

00:34:42.613 --> 00:34:44.048
PROJECT CHANGE THAT I BELIEVE

00:34:44.115 --> 00:34:45.983
THAT COLLEGE WAS AN OPTION FOR

00:34:46.050 --> 00:34:48.352
ME- AND ONCE I GOT THERE I. I

00:34:48.419 --> 00:34:49.754

TWO YEARS- AND THEN MY LAST YEAR

ALLOWED ME TO TRANSFER TO UCLA.

00:35:00.932 --> 00:35:02.200
I GOT SUPER INVOLVED IN

00:35:02.266 --> 00:35:04.168
STATEWIDE- FORMING CURSORY

CHANGED THE TRAJECTORY OF MY

00:35:07.438 --> 00:35:09.941
LIFE- AND SO NOW PART OF WHAT I

00:35:10.007 --> 00:35:10.541
DO IS I BRING YOUNG PEOPLE TO

00:35:10.608 --> 00:35:12.343

00:41:43.868 --> 00:41:45.736
STRUCTURE OF THE PROGRAM IT'S-

00:41:45.803 --> 00:41:48.372
BASED IN A COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND

00:41:48.439 --> 00:41:49.440

CORDON COMMUNITY SCHOOLS SO WHAT

00:42:32.816 --> 00:42:35.152

00:43:06.083 --> 00:43:08.385
ASPECT OF YOUNG PEOPLE BEING-

00:43:08.452 --> 00:43:11.455
CREDIT DEFICIENT- AS PART OF.

00:43:11.522 --> 00:43:13.090
WHAT HAPPENS- THIS IS ALSO

00:43:13.157 --> 00:43:15.826
INSTEAD OF POSITIVE SHIFT-

00:43:15.893 --> 00:43:18.329
TOWARDS HAVING THEIR CREDITS BE

00:43:18.395 --> 00:43:19.663
AT COLLEGE AND HIGH SCHOOL AT

00:43:19.730 --> 00:43:21.398
THE SAME TIME VERSUS WHAT I

00:43:21.465 --> 00:43:22.599
THINK IS TRADITIONALLY BEEN DONE

00:43:22.666 --> 00:43:24.301
WHERE IT'S INDEPENDENT STUDY. OR

00:43:24.368 --> 00:43:26.136
ADULT SCHOOL I'M SAID THIS SHIFT

00:43:26.203 --> 00:43:28.739
SENT TO- HAVING AGAIN ALL OF

00:43:28.806 --> 00:43:30.507
THAT COMPONENTS THAT COME WITH

00:43:30.574 --> 00:43:32.209
BEING PART OF- A COLLEGE

00:43:32.276 --> 00:43:34.011
ATMOSPHERE WHERE IT'S POSITIVE-

00:43:34.078 --> 00:43:35.746
IDENTITY AND IT'S ALSO A MESSAGE

00:43:35.813 --> 00:43:37.348
TO YOUNG PEOPLE TO THAT. YOU

00:43:37.414 --> 00:43:38.882

00:43:38.949 --> 00:43:40.451
ARE AVAILABLE TO YOU AND ALSO WE

WHAT MADE OF A- TO YOU- SO%

00:43:46.724 --> 00:43:48.926
THAT'S THE INSIDE COMPONENTS-

00:43:48.993 --> 00:43:50.461
AND THEN THE ON CAMPUS COMPONENT

00:43:50.527 --> 00:43:53.163
WHICH I THINK IS. A HUGE- PART

00:43:53.230 --> 00:43:55.632
OF THE FOCUS AND AGAIN WITH THE

00:43:55.699 --> 00:43:57.501
DJJ CLOSURE AND EVERYTHING

00:43:57.568 --> 00:43:58.635
THAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW IN

00:43:58.702 --> 00:44:00.537
CALIFORNIA I THINK THIS IS

00:44:00.604 --> 00:44:01.472
ANOTHER HUGE PIECE WHICH IS

00:44:01.538 --> 00:44:04.174
THAT- YOUNG PEOPLE ARE ON THE

00:44:04.241 --> 00:44:05.709
CAMPUS TAKING COURSES JUST AS

00:44:05.776 --> 00:44:07.411
ANY COLLEGE STUDENT WOULD DO BUT

00:44:07.478 --> 00:44:09.780
THEY HAVE. A NETWORK- AND NECK

00:44:09.847 --> 00:44:11.815
MENTIONED I'M A LITTLE BIT THAT

00:44:11.882 --> 00:44:13.117
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT NECK

00:44:13.183 --> 00:44:15.419
ACTUALLY BUILT- VERY MUCH WHICH

00:44:15.486 --> 00:44:17.321
IS WHERE YOUNG PEOPLE ARE PART

00:44:17.388 --> 00:44:20.524
OF H. COMMUNITY BASED LEARNING-

00:44:20.591 --> 00:44:23.193
THEY HAVE- STUDENT LEADERSHIP

00:44:23.260 --> 00:44:26.363
AND BATTED AND A WHOLE. NETWORK

00:44:26.430 --> 00:44:28.399
OF PEOPLE ON THE CAMPUS THAT ARE

00:44:28.465 --> 00:44:30.000
DEEPLY DEDICATED TO THE STUDENTS

00:44:30.067 --> 00:44:31.835
SUCCESS ALL THE WAY FROM YOU

00:44:31.902 --> 00:44:32.870
KNOW THE CHANCELLOR TO THE

PRESIDENT TO FACULTY AND THAT'S

00:44:34.872 --> 00:44:36.373
A BIG PART OF. THE PROGRAM

00:44:36.440 --> 00:44:37.808
STRUCTURES THAT YOU WANT BY AND

00:44:37.875 --> 00:44:39.576
FROM THE ENTIRE CAMPUS COMMUNITY

00:44:39.643 --> 00:44:42.079

PEOPLE ARE- SINCE UNFORTUNATELY

00:44:48.719 --> 00:44:50.687
THAT CONTINUES TO BE A STIGMA-

00:44:50.754 --> 00:44:54.725
SO THAT'S A LITTLE BIT OF THE

00:44:54.792 --> 00:44:55.626
STRUCTURE OF THE PROGRAM. AND

00:44:55.692 --> 00:44:57.061
HOW MANY COMMUNITY COLLEGES

00:44:57.127 --> 00:44:59.263

00:44:59.329 --> 00:45:01.565
TO PROJECT CHANGE. THERE IT IS

00:45:01.632 --> 00:45:03.167
BEEN THE DIRECT PROGRAM HAS BEEN

00:45:03.233 --> 00:45:06.136
REPLICATED ACROSS THREE COLLEGE

00:45:06.203 --> 00:45:07.838
- THEY'RE SIMILAR PROGRAMS WITH

00:45:07.905 --> 00:45:08.906
THE RISING SCHOLARS NETWORK

ACROSS THE STATE- THERE ARE.

00:45:13.243 --> 00:45:14.078
TWENTY SIX COLLEGES THAT HAVE

00:45:14.144 --> 00:45:16.547
STARTED TO FOCUS ON JUVENILE

00:45:16.613 --> 00:45:19.183
JUSTICE IN PARTICULAR- AND SO IF

00:45:22.519 --> 00:45:25.489
SCHOLARS NETWORK- HAS REALLY

00:45:25.556 --> 00:45:28.158
FOCUSED ON THE ADULT POPULATION-

JAILS PRISONS- BUT HAS DONE WORK

00:45:30.761 --> 00:45:32.329
WITH YOUTH AND IN THE LAST

00:45:32.396 --> 00:45:34.098
COUPLE YEARS HAS REALLY TURNED

00:45:34.164 --> 00:45:35.532
THEIR ATTENTION- IN

00:45:35.599 --> 00:45:38.235
COLLABORATION WITH OUR YOU KNOW.

00:45:38.302 --> 00:45:40.404
FOLKS SITTING HERE AND OUT IN

00:45:40.471 --> 00:45:41.538
THE COMMUNITY TO MAKE SURE THAT

00:45:41.605 --> 00:45:44.808
JUVENILE JUSTICE IS ANOTHER-

00:45:44.875 --> 00:45:47.744
AREA THAT THERE'S ATTENTION TO.

00:45:47.811 --> 00:45:50.914
AND FOR BEFORE THE STUDENTS ARE

PROGRAMS LIKE THIS YES SO THAT'S

00:46:19.476 --> 00:46:20.911
THE DUAL ENROLLMENT PIECE- WHERE

00:46:20.978 --> 00:46:22.846
YOUNG PEOPLE ARE TAKING COLLEGE

00:46:22.913 --> 00:46:25.315
CLASSES REGARDLESS OF DIPLOMA OR

00:46:25.382 --> 00:46:27.818
EVEN FIFTEEN SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN

00:46:27.885 --> 00:46:29.486

THEY CAN ALSO STILL BE ENGAGED

00:46:41.999 --> 00:46:44.268

SCHOOL COURSES SO THERE'S THAT-

00:46:51.775 --> 00:46:53.377
THERE'S ALSO A LOT OF WRAPAROUND

00:46:53.443 --> 00:46:55.078
SUPPORT SERVICES- THAT ARE MADE

00:46:55.145 --> 00:46:57.247

00:47:14.498 --> 00:47:15.632
LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THE

00:47:15.699 --> 00:47:17.100
NETWORK THAT'S BEEN CREATED AT

00:47:17.167 --> 00:47:18.135
THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE FOR THE

00:47:18.202 --> 00:47:19.369
FIRST TWO MONTHS AND THEN PART

00:47:19.436 --> 00:47:20.771
IN THAT IMPORTANT PIECE IS THERE

00:47:20.837 --> 00:47:22.873
A NETWORK LIKE THAT THAT THE

00:47:22.940 --> 00:47:23.840
STUDENTS GET WHEN THEY GO BACK

00:47:23.907 --> 00:47:25.976

CREATED THAT'S THE SOCIAL PEACE-

00:47:36.486 --> 00:47:38.722
BUT ALSO AGAIN HAVING ACCESS TO

00:47:38.789 --> 00:47:41.291
ALL THE COURSES AND BASIC NEEDS

00:47:41.358 --> 00:47:43.627
SUPPORTS BUT THE SOCIAL ASPECT

00:47:43.694 --> 00:47:44.861
OF BEING ABLE TO MEET REGULARLY

00:47:44.928 --> 00:47:46.296
THERE'S A- FOR A LONG TIME

00:47:46.363 --> 00:47:48.232
THERE'S BEEN A ONCE A WEEK-

00:47:48.298 --> 00:47:49.566

SUPPORT SYSTEM- AND THERE. IT

00:47:56.807 --> 00:47:58.609
THE GOAL IS ALSO TO HAVE IT BE A

00:47:58.675 --> 00:48:00.477
MULTIPLE ENTRY POINTS SO THAT'S

00:48:00.544 --> 00:48:02.346
NOT LEAVING ANY YOUNG PERSON

00:48:02.412 --> 00:48:06.016

JACQUELINE AND NICK- ETHNIC

00:48:18.795 --> 00:48:21.365
SPECIFICALLY YOU TALKED ABOUT

00:48:21.431 --> 00:48:22.866
HOW. YOU SOLVE SCHOOL IS A PLACE

00:48:22.933 --> 00:48:25.902
OF PUNISHMENT AND- THIS IS A

00:48:25.969 --> 00:48:31.775
PROJECT CHANGE HELP YOU CHANGE.

00:48:31.842 --> 00:48:32.776
CHANGE THAT HOW. WHAT WAS THAT

00:48:32.843 --> 00:48:34.478
THE ATTRACTED YOU I MEAN HOW YOU

00:48:34.544 --> 00:48:36.346
KNOW WE HAVE LOTS OF PROJECTS

00:48:36.413 --> 00:48:37.681
OUT THERE PROGRAMS OUT THERE FOR

00:48:37.748 --> 00:48:38.615
INDIVIDUALS RIGHT AND THEN

00:48:38.682 --> 00:48:40.350
THERE'S THAT. YOU YOU DECIDE AND

00:48:40.417 --> 00:48:42.252
STICK IT ON EACH OF IT AND SO

00:48:42.319 --> 00:48:44.221
I'M EXCITED THAT WE HAVE THESE

00:48:44.288 --> 00:48:45.822
EXAMPLES WITH THE THREE OF YOU

00:48:45.889 --> 00:48:46.857
WHAT WAS SPECIAL ABOUT THIS

00:48:46.923 --> 00:48:47.491
PROGRAM TO CONVINCE YOU TO TAKE

00:48:47.557 --> 00:48:51.695
ADVANTAGE. OF IT. YEAH SO I

00:48:51.762 --> 00:48:52.729
THINK FIRST OF ALL ESPECIALLY

00:48:52.796 --> 00:48:54.564
LIKE I USED TO FOR ME AND I

00:48:54.631 --> 00:48:56.366
THINK IT'S TRUE FOR THIS

00:48:56.433 --> 00:48:57.267
POPULATION IN GENERAL I THINK

00:48:57.334 --> 00:48:58.769
YOU KNOW K. THROUGH TWELVE YOU

00:48:58.835 --> 00:49:00.671
REALLY JUST IN SURVIVAL MODE YOU

00:49:00.737 --> 00:49:01.772
DON'T REALLY HAVE THE MOST

00:49:01.838 --> 00:49:03.674
CONTROL OVER YOUR ENVIRONMENT-

00:49:03.740 --> 00:49:04.574
OVER LIKE WHAT'S HAPPENING IN

00:49:04.641 --> 00:49:07.177
YOUR LIFE AS AN ADULT YOU GAIN A

AGENCY GET GET MORE AGENCY

00:49:14.284 --> 00:49:17.421
RIGHT- AND SO I THINK WHEN I WAS

00:49:17.487 --> 00:49:18.755
APPROACHED BY IT BY PROJECT

00:49:18.822 --> 00:49:20.490
CHANGE AND THEY'RE LIKE OH LIKE

00:49:20.557 --> 00:49:21.692

00:49:23.894 --> 00:49:25.329
OUTBREAKS I HAD THIS CONCEPTION

00:49:25.395 --> 00:49:27.431

AT THE COMMUNITY LEVEL IS LIKE

00:49:37.007 --> 00:49:38.475
THAT'S PROBABLY TOO MUCH FOR ME

00:49:38.542 --> 00:49:39.943
YOU KNOW RIGHT- AND SO HAVING

00:49:40.010 --> 00:49:42.245
THAT COMPONENT WHERE- IT WAS

00:49:42.312 --> 00:49:44.181

00:49:44.247 --> 00:49:45.415
THEN ALSO HAVING LIKE MENTOR

WELL WHO IS A PROFESSOR OF FILM

00:50:05.736 --> 00:50:07.371

ARE KEY COMPONENTS- REALLY

00:50:09.439 --> 00:50:11.141
CHANGED FOR ME AND THEN ONCE WE

AND HAVING THESE. THE SAME

00:51:28.652 --> 00:51:29.586
PEOPLE GOING THROUGH THE EXACT

00:51:29.653 --> 00:51:31.288

00:51:40.831 --> 00:51:42.265
CAN BUILD YOU KNOW FROM. THE

00:51:42.332 --> 00:51:43.900
BOTTOM UP AND- THEY NEVER GIVE

00:51:43.967 --> 00:51:45.969
UP AND THAT'S JUST ONE THING

00:51:46.036 --> 00:51:47.370
THAT YOU KNOW STANDS OUT TO ME

00:51:47.437 --> 00:51:48.805

FOR US. OKAY ONE MORE THING SEE

00:51:55.512 --> 00:51:57.347
HOW. AT THINK THAT THAT'S ALL

00:51:57.414 --> 00:51:58.281
REALLY IMPORTANT PART OF THE

00:51:58.348 --> 00:51:59.716
PROGRAM MODEL IS IT IT'S NON

00:51:59.783 --> 00:52:01.952
PUNITIVE SO. THERE THERE ARE

00:52:02.018 --> 00:52:02.953
OTHER PROGRAMS FOR STUDENTS AT

00:52:03.019 --> 00:52:04.287
COMMUNICABLE JUST LIKE YOUR P.

00:52:04.354 --> 00:52:06.556
OR UPS RIGHT. BUT YOU HAVE TO

00:52:06.623 --> 00:52:07.624
MEET CERTAIN CRITERIA IS YOU

00:52:07.691 --> 00:52:09.125

UNITS YOU NEED LIKE A CERTAIN

00:52:11.394 --> 00:52:13.396
GPA- AND THAT AND I THINK THAT

00:52:13.463 --> 00:52:14.397
THAT DETERS A LOT OF THIS

00:52:14.464 --> 00:52:15.499
POPULATION- BECAUSE F YOU CAN

00:52:15.565 --> 00:52:17.133
POTENTIALLY HAVE. THESE THESE

00:52:17.200 --> 00:52:18.635
PRIVILEGES REVOKED SOME PEOPLE

00:52:18.702 --> 00:52:19.603
JUST DON'T WANT TO TOUCH IT

00:52:19.669 --> 00:52:21.605
BECAUSE THEY'VE ALREADY HAD SO

00:52:21.671 --> 00:52:22.405
MANY NEGATIVE EXPERIENCES WITH

00:52:22.472 --> 00:52:24.007
WITH PROGRAMS RIGHT. WHERE THEY

00:52:24.074 --> 00:52:25.976
THEY'RE LIKE OH WE GOT YOU AND

00:52:26.042 --> 00:52:26.643
THEN THEY THEY ABANDONED YOU- SO

00:52:26.710 --> 00:52:28.311
THIS THIS THAT PART OF THE

00:52:28.378 --> 00:52:32.415
PROGRAM MODEL IS A KEY-

00:52:32.482 --> 00:52:38.421
PROBABLY. THE BIGGEST. YES

00:52:38.488 --> 00:52:40.257
THAT'S- I NEXT THING YOU SO MUCH

00:52:40.323 --> 00:52:41.558

00:52:42.692 --> 00:52:44.127

WHEN I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL. BUT I

00:57:21.805 --> 00:57:23.973
WAS AROUND THAT SAME GROUP OF

00:57:24.040 --> 00:57:25.775
FRIENDS THAT HAD THE SAME. NINE

00:57:25.842 --> 00:57:27.911
TAINTED THAT FELT THE SAME WAY

00:57:27.977 --> 00:57:32.015
AND SO HOW HOW CAN YOU GO FROM.

00:57:32.081 --> 00:57:33.650
ONE KIND OF SET OF FRIENDS

00:57:33.716 --> 00:57:36.719
SITUATIONS AND THEN ALL OF A

00:57:36.786 --> 00:57:41.558
pTURNED ON TO SAID. THIS IS THE

00:57:41.624 --> 00:57:49.632
WAY TO GO. FOR ME- WE ALL COME

00:57:49.699 --> 00:57:51.401
INTO THIS WORLD BY OURSELVES

00:57:51.467 --> 00:57:53.303
WE'RE ALL KIND OF LEAVE OUT OF

00:57:53.369 --> 00:57:54.370
THIS WORLD BY OURSELVES I FEEL

00:57:54.437 --> 00:57:59.576
LIKE FOR ME IT'S WHAT DRIVES YOU

00:57:59.642 --> 00:58:01.578
TO MAKE YOU SUCCESSFUL WHAT'S

00:58:01.644 --> 00:58:04.848
GOING TO BE BENEFICIAL FOR YOU

00:58:04.914 --> 00:58:07.250
NOT NOT YOUR FRIENDS THE YOU

00:58:07.317 --> 00:58:09.452
KNOW AT THE END OF THE DAY THEY

00:58:09.519 --> 00:58:11.354
CAN STICK WITH YOU AND CHEER YOU

00:58:11.421 --> 00:58:13.623
ON AND YOU KNOW WILL BE WITH YOU

00:58:13.690 --> 00:58:15.358
AND GET TO WHERE YOU YOU KNOW

00:58:15.425 --> 00:58:17.427
YOU WANT TO BE IN LIFE AS WELL

00:58:17.493 --> 00:58:19.829
AS HELPING OTHERS- BUT THEN YOU.

00:58:19.896 --> 00:58:23.466
ALSO SIT BACK AND YOU KNOW STAY

00:58:23.533 --> 00:58:24.968
BACK WITH THEM IF THAT MAKES

00:58:25.034 --> 00:58:28.371
SENSE AND DO NOTHING AND- I JUST

00:58:28.438 --> 00:58:30.139
BELIEVE IT ALL DEPENDS ON HOW

00:58:30.206 --> 00:58:33.643
SELF DRIVEN YOU ARE AND HOW MUCH

00:58:33.710 --> 00:58:38.715
SELF CONTROL YOU KNOW YOU HAVE-

00:58:38.781 --> 00:58:40.350
SO YEAH THAT WOULD ALWAYS IN

00:58:40.416 --> 00:58:42.752
YOU. IT JUST READ OUT OF YOU IT

00:58:42.819 --> 00:58:45.688
JUST IT TOOK A LITTLE BIT MORE.

00:58:45.755 --> 00:58:47.290
FOR IT TO COME OUT TO ACTUALLY

00:58:47.357 --> 00:58:50.326
SEE YOU KNOW OKAY I CAN ACTUALLY

00:58:50.393 --> 00:58:51.461
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT I CAN

00:58:51.527 --> 00:58:53.863
ACTUALLY DO IT'S NOT JUST

00:58:53.930 --> 00:58:54.931
SOMETHING THAT'S MADE UP IN MY

00:58:54.998 --> 00:58:59.068
MIND OR- YOU KNOW SO- FOR ME I

00:58:59.135 --> 00:59:00.336
DON'T FEEL LIKE I'M FROM ALL

00:59:00.403 --> 00:59:02.972
THAT CREATIVE A PERSON RIGHT-

00:59:03.039 --> 00:59:05.608
BUT I DO LIKE A PICK UP MENTORS

00:59:05.675 --> 00:59:07.343
AND ROLE MODELS ON THE WAY AND

00:59:07.410 --> 00:59:09.345

00:59:09.412 --> 00:59:10.847
HAD HAD BEEN TO THE SYSTEM AS

00:59:10.914 --> 00:59:13.049
WELL AND WAS NOW LEADING THIS

00:59:13.116 --> 00:59:13.850
PROGRAM- I REALLY LOOKED UP TO

00:59:13.917 --> 00:59:15.285
HER AND THEN- THROUGH THAT

00:59:15.351 --> 00:59:16.786

MULTIPLE LEVELS- IF IT REALLY

00:59:25.028 --> 00:59:26.029
WAS THAT COMMUNITY

00:59:26.095 --> 00:59:28.164
ACCOUNTABILITY ASPECT IN SEEING

00:59:28.231 --> 00:59:28.698

FREE- AND WENT TO FLORENCE AND

00:59:36.306 --> 00:59:37.674
LEFT THE COUNTRY FOR THE FIRST

00:59:37.740 --> 00:59:39.909

CHANGING FOR ME. AND I DON'T

00:59:41.911 --> 00:59:43.646
THINK I WOULD HAVE DONE THAT- IN

00:59:43.713 --> 00:59:46.182
IN ANY OTHER WAY THAN- HAVING

00:59:46.249 --> 00:59:48.184
ACCESS TO COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND

00:59:48.251 --> 00:59:49.352

GERMAN POINT IS OBVIOUSLY MY

01:00:25.321 --> 01:00:28.524
CHILDREN- I DON'T WANT THEM TO

01:00:28.591 --> 01:00:30.593
GROW UP THE SAME WAY I DID-

01:00:30.660 --> 01:00:33.096
BECAUSE I CAME FROM A GREAT HOME

01:00:33.162 --> 01:00:34.397
MY MOM WAS A SINGLE MOTHER

01:00:34.464 --> 01:00:36.265
UNDOCUMENTED INDIVIDUAL SHE WAS

01:00:36.332 --> 01:00:38.401
WORKING THREE TO FOUR JOB SO SHE

01:00:38.468 --> 01:00:40.269
CAN BE HOME TO TAKE CARE OF ME

01:00:40.336 --> 01:00:42.438
EVEN F SHE WANTED TO SO WE GAVE

01:00:46.409 --> 01:00:48.344
ME IN TROUBLE SO WHEN I HAD MY%

01:00:48.411 --> 01:00:49.779
KIDS ARE YOU KNOW IMMEDIATELY I

01:00:49.846 --> 01:00:51.647
WAS LIKE I CANNOT PUT MY KIDS

01:00:51.714 --> 01:00:53.383
THROUGH THE SAME THING THAT I

01:00:53.449 --> 01:00:55.184
WENT THROUGH AND I HAVE THE

01:00:55.251 --> 01:00:57.186
UPPER HAND BY YOU KNOW HAVING

01:00:57.253 --> 01:00:58.521
ALL THESE RESOURCES OFFERED FOR

01:00:58.588 --> 01:01:00.957
ME MY MOM WORKED SO HARD FOR YOU

01:01:01.024 --> 01:01:02.725
TO BE YOU KNOW THE PERSON THAT I

SO THAT THEY WOULDN'T GO TO THE

01:01:10.500 --> 01:01:12.702
SYSTEM LIKE. SO IMMEDIATE WHEN I

01:01:12.769 --> 01:01:13.603
WENT STRAIGHT TO COLLEGE EVEN

01:01:13.669 --> 01:01:15.705
THOUGH I HAD NO IDEA WHAT TO DO.

01:01:15.772 --> 01:01:17.373
I KNEW THAT I WANTED TO SUCCEED

01:01:17.440 --> 01:01:18.708
FOR MY CHILDREN AND FOR MYSELF I

01:01:18.775 --> 01:01:20.343
OWED IT TO MYSELF AS WELL.

BECAUSE I KNEW I HAD IT IN ME I

01:01:22.545 --> 01:01:24.414
JUST HAD TO GET IT OUT OF ME

01:01:24.480 --> 01:01:26.449

TRYING TO GET PEOPLE INTO THOSE

01:03:58.534 --> 01:04:00.469
PROGRAMS AND THE FACILITIES ARE

01:04:00.536 --> 01:04:01.504

01:04:56.392 --> 01:04:58.761
PEOPLE- AND OUR SHIFT IN THE

01:04:58.828 --> 01:05:00.396
JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM NOW WE

01:05:00.463 --> 01:05:02.198
ALSO HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO RE

01:05:02.265 --> 01:05:04.333
ENVISION WHAT JUVENILE JUSTICE

01:05:04.400 --> 01:05:06.769
LOOKS LIKE- BUT WHERE INSTEAD OF

01:05:06.836 --> 01:05:07.903
YOUNG PEOPLE BEING AND

01:05:07.970 --> 01:05:09.338
FACILITIES THEY CAN BE IN THEIR

01:05:09.405 --> 01:05:11.207
HOME COMMUNITIES BEING DUALLY

01:05:11.274 --> 01:05:13.643
ENROLLED BEING IN CLASSES HAVING

01:05:13.709 --> 01:05:15.645
WRAPAROUND SUPPORT SERVICES AND

01:05:15.711 --> 01:05:17.513
THERE'S A REAL OPPORTUNITY WITH

01:05:17.580 --> 01:05:19.615
THESE THINGS HAPPENING. TO HAVE

01:05:19.682 --> 01:05:21.484
THAT BE MORE OF THE STRUCTURE-

01:05:21.550 --> 01:05:23.953
ESPECIALLY FOR YOU- SO THAT'S A

01:05:24.020 --> 01:05:25.421
HUGE PART OF WHAT WE WANT TO

01:05:25.488 --> 01:05:26.722
SHARE TODAY BECAUSE THAT'S PART

01:05:26.789 --> 01:05:28.324
OF WHAT THE PROGRAM IS DONE AS

01:05:28.391 --> 01:05:30.359
WELL AS YOUNG PEOPLE HAVE BEEN

01:05:30.426 --> 01:05:31.661
RELEASED EARLY TO BE ABLE TO

01:05:31.727 --> 01:05:33.896
TAKE COURSES AT THE CAMPUS- OR

01:05:33.963 --> 01:05:35.898
OF HAD A DIVERSION WHERE THEY'RE

01:05:35.965 --> 01:05:37.533
NOT INCARCERATED AT ALL AND

01:05:37.600 --> 01:05:39.969
THEY'RE INVOLVED IN COURSES AND-

01:05:40.036 --> 01:05:40.736
DO YOU KNOW THAT SOCIAL

01:05:40.803 --> 01:05:42.505
COMPONENT AND ALL THE WRAPAROUND

01:05:42.571 --> 01:05:46.275
SUPPORT SERVICES. AND SO- THAT'S

01:05:46.342 --> 01:05:49.545
THAT'S WHAT I THINK IS REALLY

01:05:49.612 --> 01:05:50.513
EXCITING THAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT

01:05:50.579 --> 01:05:57.486
NOW TO. AFTER IS IT IT'S YOUR

01:05:57.553 --> 01:06:01.991
QUESTION IS A LARGE SELECTION-

01:06:02.058 --> 01:06:03.759
WELL FIRST OF ALL LET ME-

01:06:03.826 --> 01:06:05.394
CONGRATULATE YOU ALL FOR YOUR

01:06:05.461 --> 01:06:07.496
SUCCESS THAT THAT YOU ANY VOTE

01:06:07.563 --> 01:06:08.764
WHAT YOU'VE OVERCOME IT IT'S

01:06:08.831 --> 01:06:13.169
PRETTY REMARKABLE- I WOULD SAY I

01:06:13.235 --> 01:06:16.038
HAVE TO REALLY STRONG QUESTIONS.

01:06:16.105 --> 01:06:18.040
BECAUSE WHAT SEEMS WHAT'S BEEN

01:06:18.107 --> 01:06:21.410
MY EXPERIENCE AND RELATING TO-

01:06:21.477 --> 01:06:23.079
THIS PARTICULAR POPULATION THAT

01:06:23.145 --> 01:06:25.348
WE'RE ADDRESSING HERE IS THERE'S

01:06:25.414 --> 01:06:27.717
A LOT OF TRUST THAT'S BEEN LOST.

01:06:27.783 --> 01:06:29.318
BECAUSE WHAT HAPPENS IS THERE'S

01:06:29.385 --> 01:06:31.887
A LOT OF EARLY SETBACKS AND SELF

01:06:31.954 --> 01:06:36.625
ESTEEM GOES WAY DOWN. AND- TO

01:06:36.692 --> 01:06:38.260
COMPETE IN A COLLEGE ATMOSPHERE

01:06:38.327 --> 01:06:39.962
I DON'T CARE IF IT'S COMMUNITY

01:06:40.029 --> 01:06:42.431
COLLEGE OR NOT. IT'S HARD

01:06:42.498 --> 01:06:45.568
ESPECIALLY IF YOU DON'T HAVE.

01:06:45.634 --> 01:06:47.903
THE APTITUDE SKILLS LIKE WRITING

01:06:47.970 --> 01:06:49.772
THAT JUST SOMETHING AS BASIC AS

01:06:49.839 --> 01:06:50.573
BEING ABLE TO PUT TOGETHER A

01:06:50.639 --> 01:06:53.309
PARAGRAPH THAT'S EANINGFUL

01:06:53.376 --> 01:06:56.379
UNDERSTANDABLE AND- I'M TELLING

01:06:56.445 --> 01:06:58.614
YOU IT'S NOT AN EASY SKILL TO

01:06:58.681 --> 01:07:00.816
FIND PEOPLE WHO. GRADUATE FROM

01:07:00.883 --> 01:07:04.153
HIGH SCHOOL MUCH LESS THOSE WHO

01:07:04.220 --> 01:07:05.721
HAVE HAD TO SKIP SCHOOL IN

01:07:05.788 --> 01:07:07.556
BECAUSE OF INCARCERATION OR SOME

01:07:07.623 --> 01:07:09.392
OTHER CIRCUMSTANCE SO THE

01:07:09.458 --> 01:07:11.627
REALITY IS YOU'VE GOT TO DEVELOP

01:07:11.694 --> 01:07:13.662
SOME VERY POWERFUL SKILLS WITH

01:07:13.729 --> 01:07:16.399
VERY LOW SELF CONFIDENCE. AND

01:07:16.465 --> 01:07:20.169
THAT'S A VERY SCARY. IN RECIPE

01:07:20.236 --> 01:07:21.437
RIGHT THERE BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO

01:07:21.504 --> 01:07:23.806

TO TAKE NOTES IN CLASS. RIGHT I

01:07:32.782 --> 01:07:33.816
MEAN THESE ARE THINGS THAT

01:07:33.883 --> 01:07:35.418
PEOPLE TAKE FOR GRANTED THAT

01:07:35.484 --> 01:07:37.286
HAVE NOT GONE TO COLLEGE I'M

01:07:37.353 --> 01:07:38.687
TELLING EVERYONE OF THOSE SKILLS

01:07:38.754 --> 01:07:41.090
IF YOU DON'T HAVE ONE OF THEM.

01:07:41.157 --> 01:07:42.858
YOU'RE YOU'RE BOUND TO HAVE

01:07:42.925 --> 01:07:44.360
FAILURE IS WHAT OU'RE BOUND TO

01:07:44.427 --> 01:07:47.530
HAVE. AND SO. EVEN THOUGH YOU

01:07:47.596 --> 01:07:48.431
KNOW THESE DOORS HAVE BEEN

01:07:48.497 --> 01:07:51.066
OPENED. YOU STILL HAVE TO

01:07:51.133 --> 01:07:52.601
COMPETE YOU STILL HAVE TO PROVE

01:07:52.668 --> 01:07:54.503
YOURSELF YOU STILL HAVE TO BE

01:07:54.570 --> 01:07:56.038
ABLE TO FIND SUCCESS ECAUSE IF

01:07:56.105 --> 01:07:58.441
YOU DON'T. THEN YOU'VE ALMOST

01:07:58.507 --> 01:08:00.476
CREATED A DISSERVICE BECAUSE NOW

01:08:00.543 --> 01:08:01.744
YOU'VE GOTTEN A COLLEGE YOU

01:08:01.811 --> 01:08:03.913
PHILLIP I CAN'T DO IT. I JUST

CAN'T DO IT THAT'S A BAD

01:08:05.781 --> 01:08:09.084
SCENARIO AND SO WHAT I'M-

01:08:09.151 --> 01:08:11.754
CURIOUS ABOUT. IS HOW DO YOU

01:08:11.821 --> 01:08:12.588

MANIPULATED THIS- SITUATION. AND

01:08:21.430 --> 01:08:23.732
ESPECIALLY WITH THE LACK OF

01:08:23.799 --> 01:08:26.101
TRUST- IT'S SUPER HARD TO SUPER

01:08:26.168 --> 01:08:27.403
TO GET PEOPLE TO BELIEVE IN

01:08:27.470 --> 01:08:30.573

SCHOOL BUT IT'S A REALITY I'M

01:08:35.411 --> 01:08:36.779
