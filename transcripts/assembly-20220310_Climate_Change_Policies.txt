THE- ASPIRATION OF REACHING CARBON NEUTRALITY- EVEN BEFORE TWENTY FORTY FIVE WHAT WOULD BE THE POTENTIAL TRADE OFFS- IN DIFFERENT SECTORS SO- BEFORE I GO ANY FURTHER AND- INVITES A VICE CHAIR CENTER BACKER TO GIVE SOME OPENING REMARKS I WANT TO SAY THAT TO. THAT TO DUE TO ONGOING COVERT NINETEEN SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS ALL ARE ENCOURAGED TO WATCH THE HEARING FROM OUR LIVE STREAM ON THE ASSEMBLY'SWEBSITE. WE WELL HAVE A MODERATED TELEPHONE LINE. AVAILABLE TO ASSIST WITH PUBLIC PARTICIPATION THE PUBLIC MAY PROVIDE COMMENT BY CALLING THE FOLLOWING TOLL FREE NUMBER. IS. EIGHT SEVEN SEVEN SIX NINE TWO EIGHT NINE FIVE SEVEN. WITH THE ACCESS CODE. ONE THREE ONE FIVE FOUR TWO ZERO TWO AGAIN THE ACCESS CODE IS ONE THREE ONE. FIVE FOUR TWO ZERO TWO. SO WHAT THAT. CENTER BACKER WOULD YOU LIKE TO GET SOME OPENING REMARKS THANK YOU. THANK YOU CHAIR AB. YEAH I'LL SEE MOST OF MY REMARKS FOR THE MEETING WHICH WAS A BECOME EVEN MORE APPARENT THAN IT WAS BEFORE IN THE LAST SIX MONTHS SINCE WE LAST GATHERED THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS TO LEAD THE THAT IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO GET THINGS DONE THE FEDERAL LEVEL AND I THINK THAT AS A IT ADDED- URGENCY TO OUR HEARINGS TODAY AND THROUGHOUT THIS YEAR THANK YOU. THANK YOU- CENTER BACKER. I'D LIKE TO INVITE ANY OF THE OTHER. OKAY ASSEMBLY MEMBER EDUARDO GARCIA WELCOME AND THEN WE ALSO HAVE A COMMITTEE- ASSEMBLY MEMBER- HE FLORA HAS REQUESTED THAT HE PARTICIPATED IN THIS HEARING I WANT TO WELCOME ASSEMBLY MEMBER FLOOR SELECTS ANY. OKAY. OKAY AND WE HAVE JUST BEEN JOINED BY SENATOR SKINNER. CENTER WITH A DO YOU HAVE ANY OPENING REMARKS WE WILL GO RIGHT INTO- PANEL ONE POTENTIAL PATHWAYS TO CARBON TRELEGY WHEN A WELCOME- AMBER MAHONE. A WITH ENERGY ENVIRONMENTAL ECONOMICS- TO GIVE HER PRESENTATION ON PATHWAYS HER REPORT ON PATHWAYS TO CARBON NEUTRALITY- WELCOME MS MAHONEY. THANK YOU SO MUCH CHAIR MURATSUCHI AND THANK YOU TO THE MEMBERS OF THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEE FOR INVITING ME TO SPEAK TODAY ON THE TOPIC OF ACHIEVING CLIMATE NEUTRALITY. YEAH I ALSO APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO YOUR VIRTUALLY TODAY THAT SIMPLE ACCOMMODATION HAS HELPED TO REDUCE MY CARBON FOOTPRINT AND THE CARBON FOOTPRINT OF THIS HEARING. SO MY NAME IS AMBER MAHONE I'M A PARTNER IN ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL ECONOMICS ALSO KNOWN AS EACH THREE. E. THREE IS AN ENERGY CONSULTING AND ANALYSIS FIRM THAT WORKS ACROSS NORTH AMERICA TO SUPPORT OUR CLIENTS IN EVALUATING AND IMPLEMENTING CLEAN ENERGY POLICIES AND TECHNOLOGIES. IN CALIFORNIA WE WORK WITH ALL OF THE STATE'S ENERGY AGENCIES INCLUDING THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD THE ENERGY COMMISSION AND THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION SUPPORTING THEIR RESOURCES BOARD. IN PERFORMING AN IN DEPTH EVALUATION OF THE KANEMI WIDE CARBON NEUTRALITY SCENARIOS TO INFORM THE TWENTY TWENTY TO SCOPING PLAN. THIS INCLUDES TWO SCENARIOS THAT A CHEAP CARBON EACH HOLIDAY BY TWENTY FORTY FIVE. AS WELL AS TWO SCENARIOS THAT ACHIEVE CARBON NEUTRALITY BY TWENTY THIRTY FIVE. THE TEAM WILL BE PRESENTING SOME OF OUR PRELIMINARY MODELING RESULTS IN A PUBLIC WORKSHOP NEXT WEEK ON TUESDAY MARCH FIFTEENTH. WE ALSO PERFORM THE ELECTRIC SECTOR MODELING FOR THE JOINT AGENCY SB ONE HUNDRED CLEAN ELECTRICITY ANALYSIS AND ARE SUPPORTING THE INTEGRATED RESOURCE PLANNING. OR ERP PROCEEDING AT THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION. OVER THE PAST FIFTEEN YEARS THAT YOU THREE. MY TEAM AND I HAVE CONDUCTED CONDUCTED MANY STUDIES EVALUATING GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION STRATEGIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY. INCLUDING IN CALIFORNIA NEW ENGLAND NEW YORK THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST MINNESOTA COLORADO AND ELSEWHERE. IN TWENTY TWENTY MY TEAM AND I RELEASED A REPORT ON ACHIEVING CARBON NEUTRALITY IN CALIFORNIA. THE CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD SPONSORED THAT STUDY TO GATHER INFORMATION IN ADVANCE OF THE TWENTY TWENTY TO SCOPING PLAN. ABOUT POTENTIAL PATHWAYS AND POLICIES TO HELP THE STATE ACHIEVE CARBON NEUTRALITY FOR TWENTY FORTY FIVE. WELL MY TESTIMONY IT REFLECTS MY PERSONAL VIEWS ON THIS TOPIC. THESE PERSPECTIVES AND OF COURSE BEEN SHAPED BY THAT EXTENSIVE BODY OF WORK WITH IN CALIFORNIA AND ACROSS NORTH AMERICA. I'D LIKE TO MAKE THREE KEY POINTS TO THE COMMITTEE TODAY. FIRST CALIFORNIA HAS SET AMBITIOUS CLIMATE GOALS INCLUDING THE 40% GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION REQUIREMENTS BY TWENTY THIRTY AND THE GOAL OF CARBON NEUTRALITY BY TWENTY FORTY FIVE THIRTY FIVE IS BEING FURTHER EVALUATED AS PART OF THE SCOPING PLAN EFFORT THAT I MENTIONED WHICH IS CURRENTLY UNDER WAY. SECOND ACHIEVING CARBON NEUTRALITY IS LARGELY A PHYSICAL ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE CHALLENGE WHICH REQUIRES A WHOLESALE TRANSFORMATION OF THE WAYS WE PRODUCE AND USE ENERGY. THIRD AND FINALLY. WELL CALIFORNIA'S CLIMATE GOALS ARE AMBITIOUS WE DON'T YET HAVE ALL OF THE POLICY REGULATORY AND FINANCING MECHANISMS IN PLACE TO IMPLEMENT THIS AMBITIOUS AGENDA. WHAT DO I MEAN BY THE PHYSICAL ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE CHALLENGE OF ACHIEVING CARBON NEUTRALITY. THIS MEANS THAT THE TIMING FOR REDUCING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS IN CALIFORNIA. HANDS ON HOW QUICKLY THE TWENTY FIVE MILLION. IN MILLIONS OF DIESEL TRUCKS ON THE ROAD TODAY CAN BE REPLACED BY ELECTRIC AND ZERO EMISSION ALTERNATIVES. IT ALSO DEPENDS ON HOW QUICKLY THE FIFTEEN MILLION OR SO HOMES AND MILLIONS OF BUSINESSES AND INDUSTRIAL FACILITIES IN THE STATE. CAN BE RETROFIT TO USE CLEAN ELECTRICITY AND OTHER ZERO CARBON FUELS FOR SPACE AND WATER HEATING INTO POWER A WIDE VARIETY OF INDUSTRIAL PROCESS THESE. AND IT DEPENDS ON HOW QUICKLY ALL KINDS OF OTHER NEW ZERO CARBON ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE. AND CARBON DIOXIDE REMOVAL TECHNOLOGIES CAN BE BUILT AND DEPLOYED. ACHIEVING CARBON NEUTRALITY IS AS LIKELY TO DEPEND ON MONDAY IN CHOICES LIKE WHAT KIND OF CAR YOU AND YOUR NEIGHBOR DRIVE. AND HOW MANY YEARS YOUR NEIGHBORS GASOLINE CAR REMAINS ON THE ROAD. AS IT DOES ON INDUSTRIAL ENERGY SUPPLY CHOICES AND THE PACE OF RENEWABLE AND ZERO CARBON ELECTRICITY DEPLOYMENT. IN OUR TWENTY TWENTY MODELING WORK WE EVALUATED THREE SCENARIOS THE CHIEF CARBON NEUTRALITY IN CALIFORNIA BY TWENTY FORTY FIVE. THE MOST AMBITIOUS OF THE SCENARIOS ASSUME THAT ALL FOSSIL FUEL EMISSIONS COULD BE ELIMINATED. BY TWENTY FORTY FIVE. THROUGH THE FOLLOWING MEASURES A RAPID TRANSITION 21100% ALL ELECTRIC AND ZERO EMISSION SALES FOR VEHICLES AND BUILDING EQUIPMENT BY TWENTY THIRTY. IN ADDITION WE ASSUMED WIDESPREAD PRODUCTION AND USE A ZERO CARBON ELECTRICITY RENEWABLY PRODUCED HYDROGEN CARBON CAPTURE AND SEQUESTRATION. AND OTHER ADVANCED BIO FUELS ALONG WITH OTHER GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCING MEASURES IN SECTORS LIKE WASTE AGRICULTURE AND FROM OTHER SOURCES OF HIGH GLOBAL WARMING POTENTIAL GASES. IN ADDITION IN ALL OF THE CITY AREAS THAT WE EVALUATED EVEN WITH AMBITIOUS STEPS TO REDUCE FOSSIL FUEL USE LAND BASED CARBON SEQUESTRATION AND DIRECT AIR CAPTURE OF CO TWO WAS FOUND TO BE A CRITICAL STRATEGY NEEDED TO ACHIEVE CARBON NEUTRALITY. DESPITE BEING IN THE VERY EARLY STAGES OF COMMERCIALIZATION TODAY. THE STUDY SHOWED THAT ACHIEVING CARBON NEUTRALITY BY TWENTY FORTY FIVE IN CALIFORNIA REQUIRES AMBITIOUS NEAR TERM ACTIONS AROUND DEPLOYMENT AND ENERGY EFFICIENCY. TRANSPORTATION AND BUILDING ELECTRIFICATION ZERO CARBON ELECTRICITY AND REDUCTIONS IN NON ENERGY NON COMBUSTION GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AS NO REGRETS STRATEGIES. IFWE LOOK BACK ON THE LAST TEN YEARS OF CLIMATE POLICY IN CALIFORNIA. ERIC LEE THE LARGEST DRIVER OF SUCCESS FOR A CHEATING CALIFORNIA'S TWENTY TWENTY CLIMATE GOALS FOR YEARS AHEAD OF SCHEDULE K. FROM GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTIONS IN THE ELECTRIC POWER SECTOR. THIS WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY THE RENEWABLE PORTFOLIO STANDARD. CRITICALLY THIS LAW CAME WITH A BUILT IN FINANCING MECHANISM. IN THE FORM OF INVESTOR AND MUNICIPALLY OWNED UTILITIES AND ELECTRIC REPAIRS. IN ADDITION BUILDING CODES AND STANDARDS RATEPAYER FUNDED ENERGY EFFICIENCY PROGRAMS AND VEHICLE FUEL ECONOMY STANDARDS HAVE ALSO BEEN CRITICAL IN REDUCING ENERGY DEMAND ACROSS THE STATE. THE LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD AND THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM HAVE ALSO BOTH PROVIDED IMPORTANT INCENTIVES IN FUNDING FOR ELECTRIC VEHICLE ADOPTION AND OTHER CARBON REDUCING MEASURES. SO LOOKING FORWARD WE KNOW THAT ACHIEVING DEEPER LEVELS OF GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTIONS WILL REQUIRE NEW COMPLEMENTARY POLICIES AND SIGNIFICANT CAPITAL INVESTMENTS ACROSS EVERY SECTOR. THE DATA ARE CLEAR THAT REDUCING EMISSIONS FROM THE ELECTRIC SECTOR ALONE WILL NOT BE IN TO MEET OUR CLIMATE GOALS. WE NEED TO FIND NEW AND CREATIVE WAYS TO SUPPORT THE COMMERCIALIZATION AND DEPLOYMENT OF ZERO CARBON TECHNOLOGIES. THE LARGEST SOURCES OF EMISSIONS IN THE STATE TODAY COME FROM PASSENGER VEHICLES. ACCELERATING THE ADOPTION OF ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES IS THEREFORE CRITICAL. WE ALSO KNOW THAT CALIFORNIA FACES A HOUSING CRISIS AND THAT BUILDING ALL ELECTRIC HOUSING IN URBAN CENTERS WITH ACCESS TO PUBLIC TRANSIT AND ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING. COULD HELP REDUCE OUR RELIANCE ON PERSONAL GASOLINE POWERED VEHICLES WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY ADDRESSING THE HOUSING SHORTAGE. CALIFORNIANS NEED BETTER ACCESS TO CLEAN AND RELIABLE PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION. AND SAFE BIKING AND WALKING CORRIDORS ALONG WITH ZERO CARBON HOUSING OPTIONS. SECTOR BASED SOLUTIONS LIKE THESE AND OTHER COMPLEMENTARY POLICIES THAT SUPPORT INCENTIVES AND FUNDING FOR ACCELERATING THE CLEAN ENERGY TRANSITION THAT IS UNDERWAY WILL HELP CALIFORNIA MAKE MORE RAPID PROGRESS TOWARDS MEETING OUR CLIMATE GOALS. THE PRIMARY CHALLENGE THAT I SEE IS NOT A LACK OF AMBITION BUT A QUESTION OF HOW WE WILL FINANCE THESE NEEDED INVESTMENTS EQUITABLY. AND RAPIDLY DEPLOY IN ADOPTING NEW TECHNOLOGIES IN EVERY SECTOR. I THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND ATTENTION AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT OUR TWENTY TWENTY CARBON NEUTRALITY STUDY THAT YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MS MAHONE. WHO WOULD LIKE TO START MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION TODAY AND I THINK IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT CONVERSATION AND COMING FROM THE CENTRAL OUT WHICH IS WHY I ASK THAT YOU ALLOW ME TO BE ON THIS- COMMITTEE- AS A- ELECTED FROM STANISLAUS COUNTY SAN JOAQUIN COUNTY IN THE HEART OF THE AG COMMUNITY. I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE THESE CONVERSATIONS- AND REALLY SOMETIMES HAVE A RURAL PERSPECTIVE BECAUSE A LOT OF WHAT WE'RE TALKING. ABOUT IS KIND OF WAIT AROUND THE URBAN SETTINGS. AND I THINK IT'S A CONVERSATION THAT. AS WE MOVE FORWARD. THAT WE UNDERSTAND THE CRITICAL NATURE. OF THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND WHAT IT. PRODUCES FOR THE ENTIRE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SO I DO HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS WHAT I WOULD LOVE- JUST RE KIND OF TOUCH ON THEM AND ONE WAS ABOUT CAP AND TRADE WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT I SUPPORT. AND HAVE IN THE PAST SOMEONE TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT. AND THEN KIND OF YOUR THOUGHTS ON. YOU MENTIONED A COUPLE DIFFERENT TIMES THAT DIFFERENT TECHNOLOGIES- THEN JUST ELECTRIFICATION. SO I GUESS MY FIRST QUESTION IS- DO YOU BELIEVE IT IS IMPORTANT FOR THE STATE TO FACILITATE AND ENCOURAGE. THE USE OF CARBON CAPTURING TECHNOLOGIES TO HELP ACHIEVE OUR GHG REDUCTION GOALS% ROLE IN THAT AS AS OF LIKE TO BODY. YES THEY BELIEVE THAT IT IS IMPORTANT TO HAVE ALL THE TOOLS IN OUR TOOLBOX THERE WILL NEED TO MEET THESE VERY AMBITIOUS GOALS. AND CARBON CAPTURE AND SEQUESTRATION IS ONE OF THOSE TOOLS. THAT THAT NEEDS SOME FURTHER. YOU KNOW. WE NEED REGULATORY THAT SUPPORT TO ENSURE THAT THE CARBON IS CAPTURED AND SAFELY STORED. AND BUT E ALSO NEED EFFORTS TO FURTHER COMMERCIALIZE THIS TECHNOLOGY THAT IS. IT IS NOT WIDELY COMMERCIALIZED AND DEPLOYED TODAY. RIGHT I THINK I'M LOOKING AT YOU TO STREAM SO I APOLOGIZE IF I'M LOOKING SIDEWAYS AT YOU DON'T NEED TO BE SO- AND THEN I SO APPRECIATE THAT IN IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY- IS. UNIQUELY POSITIONED WITHIN THE STATE AS WELL. TO HELP ACHIEVE SOME OF THOSE GOALS AND THE NICE PART ABOUT THIS AS FAR AS- STORAGE ON ON CAPTURING CARBON. AND THE NICE PART ABOUT OUR AREA AS WELL IS. IT PROVIDES JOBS AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR ATRIAL S. A TRAINED SKILLED AND TRAINED WORKFORCE. AND SO FOR THE MEN AND WOMEN THAT WOULD THAT ARE IN THESE INDUSTRIES I THINK IT IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY THAT WE CONTINUE TO STUDY THOSE. REALLY UTILIZE THE GEOGRAPHICAL LOCATION THE CENTRAL VALLEY AS IT RELATES TO THE CARBON CAPTURING AND THEN USE OUR- SKILLED TRAINED WORKFORCE. TO DO THAT- I MENTIONED BRIEFLY THAT I WAS A SUPPORTER OF- CAP AND TRADE WAS ONE OF THE FEW REPUBLICANS THAT ACTUALLY SUPPORTED THAT- SO THAT WAS A IT WAS A GREAT EXPERIENCE. DO YOU BELIEVE IT- IS A POINT WE TALK ABOUT ACHIEVING THESE BROADER GOALS POST TWENTY THIRTY BECAUSE I WAS A CAP AND TRADE- EXPIRES IN TWENTY THIRTY. THE WE ALSO TALKED PULSE AND PRO LIKE TAP INTO. THAT THAT WE CAN USE TO MEET THE STATE'S CLIMATE GOALS ONE OF THE BIG THINGS ABOUT CAP AND TRADE AND REASON I SUPPORTED IT. WAS BECAUSE OF INDUSTRIES INVOLVEMENT IN THAT. IF WE JUST COMPLETELY GO- OFF THE GRID OR ELECTRIFICATION OVERNIGHT. THERE IS GOING TO BE A TREMENDOUS COST AND SO A STEP DOWN APPROACH- IS CRITICAL AND I WOULD JUST LOVE. YOUR COMMENTS. CAN WE STILL ENCOURAGE INDUSTRIES TO ENGAGE WITH ALL OF YOU TO HAVE THE STEP DOWN APPROACH SO WE DON'T HAVE JUSTICE MASSIVE INCREASE THE COST OF LIVING- ACROSS THE CENTRAL VALLEY. I THINK YOU KNOW. I'M NOT QUITE SURE WHAT THE QUESTION THERE IS CAP AND TRADE IS BUT IT BEEN A VERY IMPORTANT STRATEGY FOR RAISING FUNDS TO SUPPORT OUR STATE'S CLIMATE REDUCTION EFFORTS AND- I THINK WHERE WE'RE GOING AND WE'RE STILL GOING TO NEED INCREASED AMBITION. IN THE INDUSTRIAL SECTOR FOR DECARBONISATION AND WHETHER CAP AND TRADE IS THE ONLY MECHANISM THAT WE USED TO REDUCE EMISSIONS FROM THE INDUSTRIAL SECTOR- I THINK. I THINK THERE'S A QUESTION THAT I HAVE THEIR AROUND WHETHER THAT WILL BE ENOUGH IF OUR GOAL IS TRULY DEAD CHIEF CARBON NEUTRALITY. I GUESS MY QUESTION IS- WITH ALL OF YOU STILL BE WILLING TO ENGAGE WITH INDUSTRIES TO ACHIEVE THESE GOALS ONE OF THE PROGRAMS WITHIN CAP AND TRADE WAS THE TRUCK REPLACEMENT PROGRAM WHERE WE TOOK TEARS ZERO ENGINES OUT AND WE'RE UP TO NOW TIER FIVE. AND WE WORKED WITH THE INDUSTRIES WITH THE MANUFACTURERS WITH THE DEALERSHIPS ACROSS THE STATE AND THEIR SALES MEN AND WOMEN TO DEVELOP A PROGRAM THAT THE AG COMMUNITY BOUGHT INTO. IT BECAME ONE OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL PROGRAMS THE CARP HAS KIND OF BEEN A PART OF FOR A VERY LONG TIME AND THE COMMUNITY HAS BOUGHT INTO US I THINK. IN GAUGE MINT- AS OPPOSED TO THE MAT CARE VERSUS THE STICK APPROACH IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE THESE SECTORS ARE WILLING TO MOVE. BUT AT A REASONABLE PACE. SO WAS. I GUESS ARE WE STILL WILL TO ENGAGE INDUSTRIES. UNDERSTOOD I DON'T SPEAK FOR THE EMERGENCIES- BUT I WOULD IMAGINE THAT ENGAGEMENT IS A CRITICAL STRATEGY FOR ACHIEVING OUR CLIMATE GOALS. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT AND I JUST WANTED TO SAY AS WE MOVE FORWARD IN THIS- COST OF LIVING IN CALIFORNIA- IS A TREMENDOUS CONCERN FOR MY COMMUNITY. AND WHETHER WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HEAVY DUTY TRUCKING AVIATION TRAINS SHIPPING- RIGHT NOW. THERE IS NOT A ELECTRIC TRACTOR OUT THERE AND WE CURRENTLY ARE THE BREAD BASKET OF THE WORLD WE GROW THE SAFEST CLEANEST PRODUCTS WE FEED AN ENTIRE NATION LARGELY AND WE SHIP A LOT OF EXPORTS INTO THE REST OF THE WORLD. SO AS WE MOVE FORWARD I WOULD JUST ENCOURAGE ALL OF US TO BE VERY VERY COGNIZANT OF THAT LIKE IF WE GO TO A RECTIFICATION INSTANTLY THERE IS GOING TO BE A TREMENDOUS COST BECAUSE AT THIS POINT AND SOME OF YOUR REPORTING LIVE ON PAGE ELEVEN OF THE REPORT. THE TECHNOLOGIES DON'T EVEN EXIST YET WE HAVEN'T GOT THERE YET SO WE HAVE TO BE VERY COGNISANT OF THAT AND I WOULD JUST ENCOURAGE ALL OF US TO KEEP THAT IN MIND AS WE MOVE FORWARD THERE IS A REAL IMPACT- TO THE MEN AND WOMEN THAT LIVE IN MY COMMUNITY- IN THE COST OF LIVING AND AT SOME POINT- WE HAVE TO BE- JUST. PROMISE OF THAT SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER I WOULD AGREE WITH THE COMMENTS AS WELL. THANK YOU CENTER BACKER. THANK YOU. OKAY SO MY COMMENTS FOR THE NEXT THAT PANEL. AS WELL BUT- I JUST IN YOUR SOME SINS WHAT WERE THE HARDEST- EMISSIONS TO ELIMINATE. THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION I'M- WE SEE THE THERE ARE CHALLENGES IN EVERY SECTOR AND OFTEN GETTING THAT LAST 10% OF CARBON OUT OF ANY SECTOR BECOMES CHALLENGING- THAT SAID YOU KNOW THINKING ABOUT SPECIFIC SECTORS. WE SEE PARTICULAR CHALLENGES IN FULLY ABATING EMISSIONS FROM AVIATION. AT AND FROM OTHER OFF ROAD TRANSPORTATION- INCLUDING HEAVY DUTY SHIPPING. HEAVY DUTY TRUCKING IS ANOTHER AREA WHERE FURTHER COMMERCIALIZATION I IS NEEDED- I TEMPERATURE INDUSTRIAL PROCESS THESE MAY REQUIRE THINGS LIKE HYDROGEN WHICH IS THE AVAILABLE TECHNOLOGY BUT AGAIN NOT WIDELY COMMERCIALIZED- AND THEN OF COURSE FULLY ELIMINATING ELECTRICITY SECTOR GETTING THAT LAST 10% WILL ALSO REQUIRE DEVELOPMENTS IN NEW TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE NOT AVAILABLE TODAY TO PROVIDE FIRMS ARE CARBON CAPACITY. SO THERE'S CHALLENGES IN EACH SECTOR AS YOU GET ALL THE WAY OUT CLOSER TO ZERO- ANYTHING ABOUT SCENARIOS THAT CAN GET AS SOON AS YOU'RE A FASTER YOU WHAT. WE USE BIGGEST CONSTRAINTS FOR. BAD GETTING THERE FASTER IS IT. BILL RATES OF CLEAN ENERGY IS A TRANSMISSION IS IT REPLACEMENT CYCLES FOR VEHICLES AND SUCH WHAT WHAT DO YOU SEE AS THE BIGGEST- THEY ARE. CONSTRAINED THAT THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION- IT'S ALL ALL OF THOSE- I DO SEE THE REPLACEMENT CYCLE FOR EQUIPMENT INCLUDING VEHICLES AND TRUCKS AS BEING A CONSTRAINT BECAUSE IT IS VERY EXPENSIVE TO. PULL THOSE VEHICLES OFF THE ROAD EARLY WHEN THEY'RE STILL BEING USED AND USEFUL THAT'S QUITE EXPENSIVE- BUT YOU KNOW THERE'S BUILD REQUIRED TO ACHIEVE THE ZERO CARBON ELECTRICITY GOALS- THAT ALSO WE DON'T REQUIRES BUILDING NEW TRANSMISSION BUILDING ZERO CARBON RENEWABLE CAPACITY- SO. THERE THERE IS A IT WE CALL IT SOMETIMES INFRASTRUCTURE INERTIA. IT'S JUST THAT IT THE TIMING CHALLENGE IN HOW QUICKLY THIS INFRASTRUCTURE CAN BE BUILT- IN IN EACH SECTOR. THANKS IS A FINALLY AND SO. YOU'RE REMEMBER YOUR MOST AGGRESSIVE NERI THIS BOUT IS IT THIRTY THREE MILLION MEGATONS OF NEGATIVE EMISSIONS IS THAT THE THAT'S YEAH THAT WAS OUR- MOST AGGRESSIVE SCENARIO THAT ELIMINATED FOSSIL FUEL COMBUSTION BY TWENTY FORTY FIVE THE ZERO CARBON ENERGY SCENARIO WHAT ARE SOME EXAMPLES OF WHAT CAN COULD BE COUNTED AS NEGATIVE EMISSIONS. YEAH SO. THERE'S A RANGE OF CARBON DIOXIDE REMOVAL STRATEGIES- THE MOST WIDELY COMMERCIALIZED TODAY IS DIRECT AIR CAPTURE OF CO TWO FROM THE ATMOSPHERE. BUT THERE'S ALSO YOU KNOW LESS THAN ONE MILLION METRIC TON OF DIRECT AIR CAPTURE DEPLOYED GLOBALLY TODAY. SO RELYING ENTIRELY ON THAT STRATEGY SEEMS RISKY AND CHALLENGING. IT ALSO REQUIRES A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF ENERGY TO POWER DIRECTOR CAPTURE SO IT'S NOT WITHOUT ITS OWN CHALLENGES. THERE ARE OTHER TYPES OF CARBON DIOXIDE REMOVAL STRATEGIES INCLUDING THE POTENTIAL TO SEQUESTER CARBON IN NATURAL AND WORKING LANDS BUT AS YOU KNOW CALIFORNIA'S AT STRUGGLING WITH WILDFIRES AND CLIMATE CHANGE AND SO. YOU KNOW USING OUR NATURAL AND WORKING LANDS IS A CARBON SINK AT IS IT A CHALLENGE ONTO ITSELF. THERE'S OTHER AND MORE SPECULATIVE FORMS OF CARBON DIOXIDE REMOVAL SUCH AS THINGS LIKE ENHANCED WEATHERIZATION- BUT SAID. I THINK AT SCALE DIRECT AIR CAPTURE IS THE MOST LIKELY SOLUTION IN THE NEAR TERM AND JUST GIVE IT UP BECAUSE WE HAD PREVIOUSLY MET HOW CONFIDENT CAN WE BE THAT THESE NEGATIVE EMISSIONS. ARE BECOMING PERMANENT AN ADDITIONAL. BECAUSE WE THERE'S BEEN CONCERNS ABOUT OTHER OFFSETS THAT HAVE NOT. BEEN PERMITTED AN ADDITIONAL. YEAH I THINK THAT'S AN EXCELLENT CONCERN AND WHEN ONE THAT WILL NEED TO BE CAREFULLY MONITORED AND EVALUATED- THE BENEFIT OF DIRECT AIR CAPTURE IS THAT YOU CAN MEASURE THE CARBON DIOXIDE THAT IS BEING CAPTURED AND WHERE THAT CO TWO IS BEING SEQUESTERED REGULATIONS AND COMPLIANCE MECHANISMS IN PLACE I WOULD ALSO BE CONCERNED ABOUT ABOUT THE ADDITIONALITY STYLE- I THINK THAT THE- THAT THE POLICIES NEED TO BE IN PLACE TO ENSURE THAT THOSE NEGATIVE EMISSIONS- ARE ARE PERMANENT AS PERMANENCE CAN BE. THANK YOU. I THE MINISTER GARCIA THANK IS CHAIR I'M INTERESTED IN- EXTENDING A BIT OF THE CONVERSATION THAT MY COLLEAGUE FROM CENTRAL VALLEY IS PUT FORWARD- SPECIFICALLY TO CARBON CAPTURE TECHNOLOGY YOU MENTIONED WHAT'S MISSING RIGHT IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO PROVE THE COMMERCIALIZATION OF THE TECHNOLOGY WE HERE. IN THE BUILDING QUITE OFTEN AND I REFER TO IT AS SOME KIND OF THE- THE FLAVOR OF THE DAY YOU KNOW AND RIGHT NOW AND THE TECHNOLOGY CONVERSATIONS AROUND RENEWABLE- TECHNOLOGIES IT'S THE CARBON CAPTURING TECHNOLOGIES AT WHAT IS THE FRAMEWORK- THE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK THAT YOU BELIEVE- IS STILL NOT- IN PLACE. TO BE ABLE TO THEN GET TO THE LEVEL OF- PROOF WHEN IT COMES TO. COMMERCIALIZATION BECAUSE WE'RE HEARING A LOT OF. A LOT OF PEOPLE. LEANING ON THIS TECHNOLOGY AND THE ABILITY TO HELP WITH THE JUST TRANSITION OF- MANY MANY JOBS THE EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE THAT IS IN PLACE- TO BE ABLE TO ENSURE THAT- WE CAN. GET TO OUR OUR GOALS AND OBJECTIVES- MUCH QUICKER WITHOUT A- MAJOR DISPLACEMENT OF PEOPLE WORKING IN CURRENT. INDUSTRIES THAT WE'RE TRYING TO SLOWLY PHASE OUT SO MAYBE YOU CAN SHARE WITH US YOUR THOUGHTS ON. WHAT IS A REGULATORY FRAMEWORK LOOK LIKE THEY NEED TO BE IN PLACE IN ORDER TO DEMONSTRATE THE SCALABILITY OF THIS TECHNOLOGY. THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION- AND I WILL NOT PRETEND TO BE AN EXPERT ON REGULATION OF CARBON CAPTURE AND SEQUESTRATION- BUT I WOULD. SUGGEST THAT. THERE NEEDS TO BE A MEASUREMENT. MONITORING AND VERIFICATION PROTOCOL. ASSOCIATED WITH CARBON CAPTURE AND SEQUESTRATION- TO ENSURE THAT AS THE CARBON STAYS UNDERGROUND AND HI THIS IS- SAFELY UNDERGROUND. ARE THERE ANY- ASSESSMENTS OF WHAT- COULD BE THE EXTENT OF. THE STATE GOVERNMENT'S ROLE IN INVESTING IN THOSE EFFORTS- WHAT IS MAYBE TOO MUCH TO INVEST IN SOME NEW TECHNOLOGY LIKE THIS- YEAH THE TYPE OF INCENTIVES THAT- ARE ASKED TO FROM US TO BE PUT FORWARD WHEN IT COMES TO NEW TECHNOLOGIES LIKE. SOLAR AND WIND MANY YEARS AGO- TO BRING IT TO POINT WHERE IT'S NOW- TOUTED THAT IT IS AFFORDABLE TO DO I MEAN I'M WONDERING DO YOU HAVE ANY THOUGHTS ON ON THAT IN TERMS OF THE FISCAL- ELEMENTS ARE INVESTMENTS ON ON STATE GOVERNMENT SIDE. TO TECHNOLOGY LIKE THIS. WELL I DO KNOW THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THROUGH THE FORTY FIVE Q. TAX CREDITS IS ALREADY COMMITTED. A SIGNIFICANT INCENTIVE TOWARDS CARBON CAPTURE AND SEQUESTRATION. SO. IN TERMS OF ADDITIONAL STATE SUPPORT- I'M NOT SURE THAT. ADDITIONAL TAX CREDITS WOULD BE NEEDED FOR CCS SPECIFICALLY. MY PERSONAL VIEW MIGHT BE TO FOCUS THOSE DOLLARS ON- ON OTHER SECTORS GIVEN THAT THE FEDERAL TAX INCENTIVES ARE ALREADY IN PLACE FOR CCS. WE APPRECIATE BOTH OF YOUR PERSONAL VIEW GIVEN THAT YOU DO HAVE SOME EXPERTISE IN THE WORK THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AND ALSO JUST TO THE OVERALL OF UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT'S HAPPENING AT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ALSO THANK YOU FOR SHARING THAT- MIGHT MY NEXT SET OF QUESTIONS WILL BE AROUND THE IDEA THAT WE CONSTANTLY TALK ABOUT. WE NEED A MIXED BAG OF TOOLS- IN ORDER TO GET TO OUR OBJECTIVES RIGHT BUT WHEN IT COMES TO HAVING SOME OF THESE CONVERSATIONS WHERE B. LET'S TALK ABOUT HYDROGEN LET'S TALK ABOUT SOME FOLKS AND OF OUR COLLEAGUES ONE TALK ABOUT- AT RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS OTHER FOLKS WANT TO TALK ABOUT. OTHER TOOLS IN THE TOOLBOX- BUT THEN WE GET STUCK ON THE IDEA OF ELECTRIFICATION- WHICH I AM A REASONS INCLUDING THE- CIRCUMSTANCES THAT SURROUND THE REGION THAT I REPRESENT WITH LITHIUM I RECOVERY- BEING FRONT AND CENTER OF A LOT OF DISCUSSIONS NATIONALLY. AND HERE IN OUR STATE BUT I ALSO SEE AN OPPORTUNITY TO REALLY- HIT SOME LOW HANGING FRUIT- WHEN IT COMES TO IMPROVING AIR QUALITY IN EMISSION REDUCTIONS USING THE DIFFERENT TOOLS IN THE TOOLBOX BUT IT'S VERY DIFFICULT- OCCASIONALLY WHEN THESE CONVERSATIONS COME UP TO GET SOME OF OUR ENVIRONMENTAL. FRIENDS TO AGREE. THAT THAT WE COULD USE- HYDROGEN SOME CASES THAT IN SOME PLACES THAT MIGHT WORK- TO MOVE IN THE DIRECTION OF RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS AND I'M- SHARING WITH YOU PERSPECTIVES THAT ARE DIVERSE. IN THE ASSEMBLY CONVERSATIONS AND SO THAT'S REALLY NOT MY SPECIFIC VIEWS ITSELF BUT I'M TRYING TO REFLECT THE- A CONVERSATION THAT ARE HAPPY THAT THAT'S HAPPENING AMONGST OUR OUR COLLEAGUES. HOW DO WE SET. THE TONE. THAT WE HAVE TO. HAVE A DIVERSE PORTFOLIO IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THESE GOALS AND NOT GET STUCK ON ONE PARTICULAR- LANE. AND PATHWAY BECAUSE I THINK THAT HAPPENS QUITE OFTEN- WITH US HERE IN- THE LEGISLATURE. I HAVE WHO WANT TO INVEST THE MONIES AND OTHER TECHNOLOGIES WE'RE BEING TOLD WERE TAKEN AWAY FROM. FROM ELECTRIFICATION GOALS AND OBJECTIVES AND SO YOUR THOUGHTS- YOUR POSITION ORGANIZATION ANALYSIS ON ANY OF THAT IS THERE. A ORDER OF HOW WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO ACHIEVE WITH THE VARIOUS. TOOLS IN THE TOOLBOX AS IT'S OFTEN SAID. I THINK IT'S A GREAT QUESTION. AND YOU KNOW HISTORICALLY I'VE BEEN A FAN OF TECHNOLOGY NEUTRAL POLICY SOLUTIONS THAT LEAVE ROOM FOR THE FACT THAT THERE'S INNOVATION AND UNKNOWNS IN HOW TECHNOLOGY WILL DEVELOP. ON THAT SAID INNER ENERGY SYSTEMS MODELING WE TEND TO FIND SOME FAIRLY CONSISTENT THEMES WHEN LOOKING AT LEAST COST OR LOWER COST SOLUTIONS TO DECARBONIZE THE ECONOMY. AND AT THAT THAT TENDS TO BE DERIVED FROM SORT OF JUST THE FUNDAMENTAL- ENERGY REQUIREMENTS FOR DIFFERENT DECARBONISATION SOLUTIONS SO FOR EXAMPLE IN CALIFORNIA'S RELATIVELY MILD CLIMATE WE DO FIND THAT ELECTRIC AIR SOURCE HEAT PUMPS ARE VERY EFFICIENT. SOLUTION FOR DECARBONISING LOW TEMPERATURE HEAT NEEDS LIKE SPACE HEATING AND WATER HEATING- FOR THE- MAJORITY OF CUSTOMERS IN CALIFORNIA THAT WILL BE AN EFFECTIVE SOLUTION NO WE DON'T FIND THAT TO BE- AS CLEAR OF A SOLUTION IN COLDER CLIMATES- SO YOU KNOW. NORTHERN HIGHLAND ASIAN PARTS OF CALIFORNIA YOU MAY STILL NEED TO CARBONIZED FUELS AND OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY THAT ARE COLDER WILL LIKELY STILL NEED DECARBONISE FEELS TO ME. WINTER PEAK HEATING NEEDS IN IN VERY COLD CLIMATES. SO YOU KNOW THAT'S THE SORT OF ONE EXAMPLE OF THE KIND OF MERIT ORDER OF DECARBONISATION SOLUTIONS THAT THEY DO VARY. BY SECTOR- BUT THESE ARE YOU KNOW THESE ARE. TRADEOFFS THAT INVOLVE- A RANGE OF CONSIDERATIONS NOT JUST ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND COST BUT ALSO. IN CUSTOMER CHOICES WHAT ARE YOU REALISTIC. RETROFIT SOLUTIONS FOR EXISTING BUILDINGS AND INDUSTRY- SO I THINK IT IS VERY HARD TO. CHOOSE A ONE SIZE FITS ALL SOLUTION FOR EVERY. APPLICATION AND THAT'S THAT'S WHERE I DO THINK THAT HAVING. CERTAIN THAT. TECHNOLOGY AGNOSTIC SOLUTIONS CAN BE BENEFICIAL THANK YOU FOR THAT ANSWER RIGHT I YEAH I AGREE- AND YOU KNOW THERE'S A FEW THINGS THAT WE TAKE AWAY FROM YOUR RESPONSE IN ONE OF A MIGHT I'M THINKING IS- D. REGION. RIGHT THAT KIND OF CAN ALSO DETERMINE THE TYPE OF TECHNOLOGIES- THAT- YOU INCORPORATE GIVEN THE CHANGES IN IN CLIMATE THAT WE'RE EXPERIENCING ARM. AND THE OTHER IS- I WANT TO JUST SAY THAT IT WITH THE BEST FIT LOW COST BENEFIT MODEL ARE THAT WE'VE UTILIZED OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS HAS REALLY PUT US IN A PLACE WHERE WE'RE STILL TALKING ABOUT- THE LACK OF ENERGY RELIABILITY. RIGHT THAT WE HAVE TOO MUCH OF ONE- THAT TECHNOLOGY IS NOT NOT THE OTHER AND ARE EXPERIENCING THE WHAT THE FAMOUS A LITTLE CURVE THAT WE SEE ON ON DOCUMENTS THAT WE TALK ABOUT AS THAT THE DOCTOR. AND NOT HAVING THE ENERGY RELIABILITY TO KEEP THE LIGHTS ON AND IN THAT THE APPROACH THERE HAS BEEN NO COST BEST FIT- AND SO I'M HOPEFUL THAT AS WE MOVE FORWARD WE TRULY TAKE A LOOK AT. THE LESSONS LEARNED THERE FOR PURPOSES OF GREATER. ENERGY RELIABILITY ALL I'M GONNA MAKE JUST ONE LAST. JOIN IN AND WANTED TO JUST PLANT. THE CONVERSATION HERE WE WE'RE PRIVILEGED ENOUGH TO CHAIR THE UTILITIES AND ENERGY COMMITTEE WHAT WE WANT TO SPEND QUITE A BIT OF TIME ON. THE CONVERSATION ABOUT TRANSMISSION COMPONENT OF CONVENIENCE AND THEN TRANSITION- BUILD OUT- AND TODAY I BELIEVE. AND YOU MAY AGREE OR NOT BUT THAT- WE ARE NOT IN LINE TO MEET OUR RENEWABLE ENERGY GOALS. AND EMISSION REDUCTION GOALS FOR A LOT OF REASONS AND ONE OF THEM HAS TO DO WITH. HOW LONG IT TAKES TO SITE- PERMIT AND BUILD A TRANSMISSION AND AS WE TALK ABOUT ALL OF THESE TECHNOLOGIES INCLUDING CARBON. CAPTURE AND SEQUESTRATION- YOU KNOW THE LAST TRANSMISSION PROJECT IN CALIFORNIA IT'S MY UNDERSTAND TOOK NINE YEARS TO SITE AND PERMIT- WE'RE NOT GOING TO GET THERE RIGHT AND SO I'M HOPING THAT WE CAN. HAVE A CONVERSATION. WITH THIS COMMITTEE AND OTHER RELEVANT COMMITTEES AS IT RELATES TO WHAT WE CAN DO. BETTER WHEN IT COMES TO SITING AND PERMITTING TRANSMISSION FOR A MEETING OUR- CLIMATE AND RENEWABLE ENERGY OBJECTIVES AND- WONDER IF YOU HAVE ANY THOUGHTS ON THAT. AND THAT WOULD BE MY LAST QUESTION AND COMMENT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR FOR MOMMY TO A CHIME IN IN THIS VERY IMPORTANT QUESTION. THANK YOU AND THEY DO HAVE A COMMENT THERE WHICH IS THAT. A LOT OF OUR WORK IT EATERY HAS. ILLUSTRATED THE VALUE OF A BROAD REGIONAL GRID IN ACHIEVING OUR DECARBONISATION GOALS RELIABLY AND COST EFFECTIVELY. AND BUILDING NEW TRANSMISSION. TO INTERCONNECT THOSE RENEWABLE RESOURCES INTO CALIFORNIA. IS ESSENTIAL AND IT IT DOES. CURRENTLY TAKE SOMETHING LIKE TEN YEARS DEPARTMENT A LARGE NEW TRANSMISSION LINE. WHICH IS PROBABLY SLOWER THAN WE WOULD LIKE IF WE WANT TO ACCELERATE OUR CLIMATE GOALS. THANK YOU WANT TO WELCOME THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER CLAUDIO OUR NEWEST MEMBER TO. OF THIS JOINT COMMITTEE- WELCOME ASSEMBLY MEMBER- DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS- AND AT THIS TIME. SENATE SKINNER HERE OKAY OKAY. ALL RIGHT I HAVE SOME. QUESTIONS I THANK YOU VERY MUCH MS MAHONEY- I'VE BEEN. FOCUSED ON YOUR STUDY- AT LEAST FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS AND- AND SO IT'S GREAT TO HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO TWENTY TWENTY REPORT- CHIEF IN CARBON NEUTRALITY IN IN CALIFORNIA FIRST OF ALL. MMHM BUT YOUR YOUR OCTOBER TWENTY TWENTY REPORT- TO. IT DID DO YOU STILL STAND BY THE REPORT I KNOW YOU CONTINUE TO BE WORKING WITH THE A. R. B. AS AS THEY ARE DEVELOPING THE SCOPING PLAN BUT- YOU KNOW BY AND LARGE THE THAT THE FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS OF YOUR TWENTY TWENTY REPORT- YOU YOU STILL STAND BY THEM AS FAR AS YOUR WORK WITH A P. THAT'S RIGHT. YEP THERE WAS A- HIGHER LEVEL STUDY THAN WHAT WE'RE CURRENTLY UNDERTAKING SO I THINK WE'LL HAVE A LOT OF. NEW INSIGHTS- IT'S MORE DETAILED WORK. BUT THE HIGH LEVEL FINDING STILL STAND OKAY. SO I KNOW THAT IN YOUR REPORT. YOU FOCUS ON ON ON THREE. ACT WAYS- YEAR- HI. CARBON DIOXIDE REMOVAL SCENARIO YOUR ZERO CARBON ENERGY SCENARIO AND YOUR BALANCE SCENARIO WHERE- I BELIEVE. IT RANGES IN TERMS OF THE EMISSION REDUCTIONS AND GROWTH'S GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS- FROM 92% REDUCTION. BY. 2045287% REDUCTION BEING THE BALLOT SCENARIO AND THE- AND THE THIRD SCENARIO THE PET THIRD PATHWAY BEING 80% REDUCTION IN GROSS GREAT GHG EMISSIONS. ARM FIRST OF A CLARIFICATION THE THESE ALL THREE OF THESE SCENARIOS- ARE TALKING ABOUT REDUCTIONS AND GROSS GHG EMISSIONS THAT DOES NOT INCLUDE- CARBON DIOXIDE REMOVAL AS PART OF THOSE PERCENTAGES IS DYING IS THAT CORRECT. THAT'S CORRECT OKAY SIR SO THE IDEA IS THAT THE CARBON DIOXIDE REMOVAL WOULD ADDRESS THE REMAINING PERCENTAGE IN ORDER TO GET TO THE HUNDRED PERCENT- CARBON NEUTRALITY BY BEFORE TWENTY FORTY FIVE. EXACTLY OKAY. SO- SO I A I GUESS THERE WAS A BILL ON ON THE ON ON THIS LAST YEAR THAT THAT THAT STILL KICKING AROUND BUT- IT'S A ON THE THAT I'VE HEARD OFTEN- IS HOW REALISTIC IS IT THAT WE CAN GET TO YOU KNOW 90% REDUCTION IN GROSS HG 87% 80% I MEAN. YOU KNOW WE N. N. N. ARE LINED LINE OF WORK IT'S OFTEN EASIER TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WE NEED TO DO IT'S HARD TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET THERE I WANT TO SEE IF YOU CAN OPINE ON HOW REALISTIC IT IS TO GET TO THESE- J. SHE REDUCTION GOALS. WELL IT'S REALISTIC FROM A TECHNOLOGY. FIVE AND ENERGY SYSTEMS PERSPECTIVE. BUT IT'S UNKNOWN HOW REALISTIC IT WOULD BE FROM AN ACTUAL IMPLEMENTATION CONSUMER ADOPTION- POINT OF VIEW BECAUSE WE DON'T YET HAVE THE POLICIES IN PLACE THAT WOULD ACCOMPLISH THAT GOAL. IF THAT ANSWERS YOUR QUESTION- IT BASICALLY WE KNOW THAT WE CAN DO IT IF WE CAN DEPLOY THE TECHNOLOGY. AT THE PACE THAT WE ASSUMED. IN THE MODEL BUT THE QUESTION IS HOW DO YOU GET THE DEPLOYMENT. HER AT THE PACE OF THE ASSUMED IN THE MODEL AND YOU KNOW THE MODEL CAN'T ANSWER THAT QUESTION. OKAY SO IT IS SO IN OTHER WORDS I'M DID THAT THREE PATHWAYS THE THREE SCENARIOS AT THE SET FORTH IN YOUR REPORT ME THAT DID THOSE ARE. THOSE ARE ROAD MAPS BUT BUT THEN IT'S- UP TO THE REST OF US TO FIGURE OUT. HOW TO MAKE IT WORK. YEAH THAT'S RIGHT I WOULD SAY WHAT WE'RE DOING I CALL IT A BACK THING EXERCISE SO WE'RE STARTING FROM THE END GOAL IN MIND WHICH IN THIS CASE IT WAS CARBON NEUTRALITY BY TWENTY FORTY FIVE. AND THEN ANSWERING THE QUESTION WHAT WOULD HAVE NEEDED TO HAPPEN BY WHEN IN ORDER TO GET US THERE. AND SO IT GIVES US SOME YOU KNOW ILLUSTRATIVE I BY POSTS FOR EACH SECTOR OF THE THINGS THAT NEED TO HAVE HAPPENED IN TERMS OF SALES OF ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES DEPLOYMENT OF. RENEWABLE ELECTRICITY IN TERMS OF TOTAL MEGAWATTS OF CAPACITY. YEAH I THINK THOSE ARE USEFUL DATA POINTS. BUT IT STILL DOESN'T ANSWER THE QUESTION OF YOU KNOW WHERE'S THE FUNDING COMING FROM- AND WHAT'S THE POLICY MECHANISM TO ENABLE AND- FOR REQUIRE THAT LEVEL OF TECHNOLOGY DEPLOYMENT. ALL RIGHT RECENTLY AND- THERE WERE THERE WAS A PERSPECTIVE OFFERED THAT- THAT THE- YOU KNOW DID IT DID THE PROBLEM WITH CLIMATE CHANGE IS NOT WITH FOSSIL FUELS THE PROBLEM IS WITH THE CO TWO- YOU KNOW SUGGESTING THAT THAT- IN A WAY IF. YOU KNOW THIS WONDERFUL TECHNOLOGY OF CARBON CAPTURE AND STORAGE CARBON CAPTURE UTILIZATION AND STORAGE WAY WHATEVER YOU. CHOOSE TO. TO CALL IT- IF THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO- YOU KNOW RELY HEAVILY ON FOSSIL FUELS YOU KNOW. IF WE UTILIZE THESE THE WONDERFUL NEW INNOVATIONS IN THE AREA OF CARBON CAPTURE AND STORAGE WE WHAT WHAT IS YOUR OPINION ON ON THAT POSITION. THAT SOUNDS LIKE A GROSS OVERSIMPLIFICATION TO ME FIRST OF ALL WE KNOW THAT THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR IS THE LARGEST SOURCE OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS IN THE STATE AND THAT'S BECAUSE OF FOSSIL FUEL EMISSIONS AND WE- THAT. ELECTRIFICATION OF THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR IS AN IMPORTANT STRATEGY TO REDUCE THOSE EMISSIONS. LIKE I SAID I DO SUPPORT CARBON CAPTURE AND SEQUESTRATION IS ONE OF THE TOOLS IN OUR TOOLBOX. BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT. WERE LEADING FOSSIL FUELS OFF THE HOOK ENTIRELY. IT IS THE CCS IS LIKELY TO PLAY. YOU KNOW A SMALL TARGETED STRATEGIC ROLE IN REDUCING EMISSIONS FROM OTHERWISE HARD TO ABATE SECTORS GOING BACK TO THE PERCENTAGES THAT WE STARTED TALKING ABOUT- IT'S COMPARED TO THE- THE THAT EMISSIONS OF NECESSARY. YOU'RE ENVISIONING YOU KNOW CARBON- DIOXIDE REMOVAL TECHNOLOGIES- AS WELL AS NATURAL WORKING LAND. THAT YOU KNOW APPROACH TO TAKE THA REMAINING PERCENTAGE BETWEEN 8% 220% OF THE NECESSARY REDUCTION TO REACH CARBON NEUTRALITY. WELL IT IT MAY WE MAY NOT EVEN NEED MORE CARBON DIOXIDE REMOVAL TECHNOLOGIES THAN THAT YOU KNOW I WOULD SAY THAT DEATH THREE SCENARIOS THAT WE EVALUATED IN THIS TWENTY TWENTY STUDY WERE VERY AMBITIOUS IN TERMS OF ASSUMING AS REDUCTIONS IN FOSSIL FUELS. THAT HAPPENED YOU KNOW MORE QUICKLY THAN WE'VE EVER SEEN HISTORICALLY- AND SO. EVEN YOU KNOW WHETHER WE CAN ACCOMPLISH THAT IS I THINK STILL AN OPEN QUESTION AND WE MAY NEED EVEN MORE AT. CARBON DIOXIDE REMOVAL WE- IF WE CAN'T REDUCE OUR DIRECT GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS THAT AS QUICKLY AS WE WOULD LIKE DIOXIDE REMOVAL STRATEGIES AND YOU YOU TALK IN YOUR REPORT ABOUT. AW YOU KNOW RELIANCE ON QUOTE RELATIVELY UNTESTED CARBON DIOXIDE REMOVAL STRATEGIES AND STRATEGIES WHICH ARE NOT A WIDE WIDELY COMMERCIALIZED I MEAN. THE IT IS IT IS IT FAIR TO SAY WHAT WHAT YOU TALKED ABOUT HOW THE MOST COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE AND SCALABLE- CARBON DIOXIDE- REMOVALS- OPTION THAT WE HAVE NOW IS DIRECT AIR CAPTURE THAT IT'S STILL. IS IN ITS INFANCY HIS IT IS AT A- IS THAT YOUR POSITION. THIRD STRAIGHT CARBON DIOXIDE REMOVAL- AND DIRECT AIR CAPTURE HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED THERE'S A FEW OPERATIONAL FACILITIES GLOBALLY SO I DO BELIEVE THAT IT IT CAN BE SCALED UP BUT I DON'T KNOW HOW QUICKLY AND IT IS STILL AS I MENTIONED AN EXPENSIVE AND ENERGY INTENSIVE PROCESS. SO THE GOAL IN THE SCENARIOS THAT WE MODELED IN TWENTY TWENTY WAS TO REDUCE THE RELIANCE ON DIRECT AIR CAPTURE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. BUT EVEN WITH THOSE VERY AMBITIOUS ASSUMPTIONS WE WERE NOT ABLE TO FIND A FEASIBLE WAY TO ELIMINATE ALL DIRECT EMISSIONS FROM THE STATE BY TWENTY FORTY FIVE. AND SO THAT NECESSITATES SOME OTHER SOLUTION AND WE WOULDWE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE A BETTER SOLUTION THAN THAN RELYING ON ONE IT IS NOT SO FULLY COMMERCIALIZED BUT- THE REALITY IS THAT THERE THERE IS NOT TODAY. AND I THINK THAT- CONSIDERATION SHOULD FACTOR INTO OUR DECISIONS ABOUT YOU KNOW TIMING AS WELL BECAUSE IT WILL TAKE TIME. TO COMMERCIALISE AND SCALE THESE NEW TECHNOLOGIES. ARM. THE POINT IS ALWAYS A IT HAS AS OFTEN ALSO OFTEN BEEN MADE THAT- THAT CALIFORNIA IS- IS- YOU KNOW- ESTIMATED TO CONTRIBUTE ABOUT 1% OF THE WORLD'S- GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS- WHAT IS THE BIGGEST DIFFERENCE THAT CALIFORNIA CAN MAKE- YOU KNOW GLOBALLY GIVEN THAT WERE ONLY 1% OF OUR SHARE OF THE GLOBAL GHG. EMISSION IT'S A GREAT QUESTION. WELL I DO BELIEVE CALIFORNIA SOMETHING LIKE BETWEEN THE FIFTH AND THE SEVENTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD AND SO WHAT WE DO TO COMMERCIALIZE AND BRING DOWN THE COST OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES. AND TO DEMONSTRATE THE SCALABILITY OF TECHNOLOGIES. IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE OF THIS YOU LEADING. ROLE THAT WE PLAY IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY. ALL RIGHT I THINK IT'S IN THAT LEADERSHIP POSITION THAT CALIFORNIA HAS A VERY IMPORTANT ROLE TO PLAY AND SO THAT WOULD INCLUDE. YOU ARE- IDENTIFYING CARBON CAPTURE CARBON DIOXIDE REMOVAL TECHNOLOGY- AS PART OF THAT INNOVATION THAT CALIFORNIA CAN CAN LEAD IN. YEAH I THINK SO OKAY. LAST TO COME IN BEFORE I TURN OVER TO THE CENTER SKINNER AYE I KNOW THAT TO. ONE OF THE MAIN. OBJECTIONS THAT WE GET TO- ANY KIND OF CARBON CAPTURE AND STORAGE- DISCUSSION IS THE CONCERN ESPECIALLY AND- LOW INCOME AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES OF- THE- FEAR THAT CARBON CAPTURE AND STORAGE WILL- YOU KNOW. ENABLE THE COULD THEY ARE OUR CONTINUED RELIANCE ON ON FOSSIL FUELS TO THE DETRIMENT OF THESE- ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE COMMUNITIES WHO HAVE SUFFERED A DISPROPORTIONATE AMOUNT OF TOXIC EMISSIONS AND CRITERIA POLLUTANTS. OUR OUR OUR OUR THEIR SIMILAR TECHNOLOGIES- UP TO CARBON DIOXIDE REMOVAL IN TERMS OF THE CAPTURE AND REMOVAL OF TOXIC EMISSIONS AND CRITERIA POLLUTANTS. THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION- THERE'S CERTAINLY AT KNOX CONTROL TECHNOLOGIES AND OTHER WAYS TO REDUCE POLLUTION- WE'VE SEEN YOU KNOW ABATEMENT FROM MERCURY FROM COAL PLANTS FOR EXAMPLE SO. I WOULDN'T SAY THAT IT'S THE SAME TECHNOLOGY AS DIRECTOR CAPTURE BUT THERE ARE. OPTIONS THERE. THEY DO. CAN CURB THAT I COMMUNITIES SHOULD HAVE A VOICE IN THAT TYPES OF FACILITIES THAT ARE OPERATING IN THEIR NEIGHBORHOODS. SO I THINK THAT'S A FAIR CRITIQUE I ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE DISTINGUISHING BETWEEN. DIRECT AIR CAPTURE WHICH IS A NEGATIVE EMISSIONS TECHNOLOGY AND CARBON CAPTURE AND SEQUESTRATION WHICH IS A WAY TO. ABATE POLLUTION THAT WOULD OTHERWISE GO INTO THE ATMOSPHERE SO THEY HAVE YOU KNOW VERY DIFFERENT APPLICATIONS COULD BE LOCATED IN VERY DIFFERENT. PARTS OF THE OF THE STATE. THERE'S ALSO. NO REASON THAT DIRECT AIR CAPTURE ACTUALLY NEEDS TO BE PHYSICALLY LOCATED IN CALIFORNIA. I BECAUSE IT'S- PULLING CARBON DIOXIDE OUT OF THE ATMOSPHERE WHICH IS A GLOBAL ABSOLUTE AND SO I THINK THAT'S ANOTHER IMPORTANT THING TO KEEP IN MIND. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH SEVERAL SKINNER- THANK YOU FIVE. SERVER SIXTEEN. I'M YEAH I APPRECIATE THE- THE- TERRACE CONNECTING INTERNET MICHAEL THANK I HAD I HAD TURNED IT ON IS IT NOT THE WAY I APPRECIATE THAT YOU- INCLUDED IN THE REPORT THE- SOME OPTIONS- THE- THE NEED OR- POSSIBILITIES FOR CARBON CAPTURE AND STORAGE AND ARE BOTH I THINK YOU'RE BOTH TECHNOLOGIES AS FAR AS I CAN READ I READ THE REPORT. AND YET YOU ALSO YOUR- CAUTIONARY ABOUT THAT A MOMENT IT'S NOT WE DON'T HAVE THE COMMERCIALIZATION THAT WOULD PUT IT INTO A- A DOMINANT STRATEGY THAT WE WOULD RELY ON AND I THINK THE OTHER REASON AND- ASSEMBLY MEMBER SAID SHE KIND OF POINTED OUT THAT THE OTHER REASON IT WOULD I THINK BE- NOT WISE TO HAVE IT THE DOMINANT IS BECAUSE- WE DO NOT WANT TO USE. ANY OF THE TECHNOLOGIES WHETHER FOR DIRECTOR CAPTURE OR FOR THE CAPTURE AND SEQUESTRATION. TO SUBSTITUTE FOR EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS BUT RATHER- BECAUSE OF THE RIVER IT EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS IN THE MOVING OFF OF THE SOURCES THAT ARE CAUSING EMISSIONS IS SO ESSENTIAL BUT IT'S MORE RECOGNITION OF THAT THE CRISIS IS SO REAL RIGHT NOW. AND THE ACTIONS URGENT. AND QUICKLY NEEDED TO ABATE THE WORST DESTRUCTION THERE WE HAVE TO HAVE ALL THE TOOLS IN THE ON THE TABLE AND CLEARLY THE I. P. C. REPORT. SEVEN STREETS THAT LBNL DUE TO RECENT REPORT THAT DEMONSTRATES THAT IT ALL DEMONSTRATES THAT NOW. ON THE QUESTION OF. THE I THE COMMERCIALIZATION. IF WE TAKE FOR EXAMPLE UTILITY GRADE BATTERY STORAGE. AS FAR AS I KNOW THERE WA NO UTILITY GRADE BATTERY STORAGE. ONLINE IN CALIFORNIA. WHEN I PASSED WHEN I AUTHORED THE BILL. THAT I HAD THE UC START THE- PROCEEDINGS TO HAVE OUR UTILITIES PURCHASE I REGRADED IN ENERGY STORAGE AND NOT A MIND ACTUALLY I WANT TO CORRECT THAT IT WAS TECHNOLOGY NEUTRAL IN THE PURPOSE OF IT WAS TO JUST RECOGNIZE THAT AS WE MOVE TO- DECARBONIZE OUR ELECTRICITY GO TO RENEWABLES WE HAD TO HAVE SOME STORAGE WE HAVE TO DO. SO AND WE WANTED TO LOOK WHY SHOULD WE ALREADY PREDICT IN ADVANCE WHAT TECHNOLOGY IS GOING TO EMERGE LET'S JUST MAKE SURE WE SEND MARKET SIGNALS TO HELP INSURE THAT TECHNOLOGIES DO EMERGE. CIRCUIT SENDS SIGNALS TO GET THE ALREADY AND THE COMMERCIALIZATION THAT'S NECESSARY WE HAVE. PHENOMENALLY ACHIEVE THAT PHENOMENALLY SO IT IS SIMILAR. IN THAT WELL I CAN'T GUARANTEE THAT WE CAN ACHIEVE IT IN THIS OTHER AREA IT'S VERY IMPORTANT FOR US TO SEND THOSE SIGNALS AT THE SAME TIME. THAT WE DON'T RENEGE ON OUR GOALS OF THE OF MOVING OFF OF. THE SOURCES SO WHEN I LOOK AT CALIFORNIA'S POLICIES AND YOU KNOW THE GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE ORDER FOR EXAMPLE OF. STOPPING THE SALE OF COMBUSTION- VEHICLES SPICER NEAR AND SUCH. THAT IS CLEARLY INFORMING PEOPLE THAT WE POLICIES ALONG WITH SOME POLICIES AROUND DIRECTOR CAPTURE IN CARBON CAPTURE AND STORAGE. I WOULD HOPE WOULD. HELP TO AMELIORATE THESE CONCERNS THAT WE WOULD BE DOING SO JUST TO GET US TO RELY ON THOSE TECHNOLOGIES NOW. MY QUESTION TO YOU IS WELL YOU CAN'T. YOU INDICATED YOURSELF YOU DON'T KNOW. I I'M JUST MAYBE IT'S NOT APPROPRIATE SPECULATION BUT- DO YOU FEEL THAT A STATE LIKE CALIFORNIA GIVEN OUR LEADERSHIP ROLE THAT WERE THAT POLICIES IN THIS AREA MIGHT. WHAT'S YOUR SENSE OF HOW MUCH INFLUENCE YOU COULD HAVE ON HELPING TO GET THOSE TECHNOLOGIES BROUGHT. DEVELOPED AND BROUGHT TO MARKET. WELL YEAH AS I SAID CALIFORNIA IS A HUGE PLAYER IN THE GLOBAL ENERGY ECONOMY AND I DO THINK THAT- WE CAN HELP TO COMMERCIALIZE AND BRING DOWN THE COST OF REVENUE AND EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES ABSOLUTELY- AND YOU'RE YOU'RE CORRECT SENATOR SKINNER AND THAT I IT NONE OF OUR- DECARBONISATION SCENARIOS. RELY ON. A SINGLE STRATEGY- AND CARBON CAPTURE AND SEQUESTRATION IS OF RELATIVELY SMALL STRATEGY COMPARED TO THE OTHER DECARBONISATION SOLUTIONS THAT ARE BEING DEPLOYED. BUT IT IS STILL A CRITICAL STRATEGY TO GETTING TO NET ZERO OR CARBON NEUTRALITY. BECAUSE IT IS SUCH A DAUNTING TASK AND REQUIRES AS A WHOLE RANGE OF SOLUTIONS- IF WE'RE GOING TO BE SUCCESSFUL. I SEE NO FURTHER QUESTIONS I. HAVE ONE LAST WRAP OF QUICK QUESTION SO WHEN YOU SAY CRITICAL IN TERMS OF CARBON CAPTURE AND STORAGE DID THEY HAVE YOU IDENTIFIED ANY REALISTIC PATHWAY FOR CALIFORNIA TO GET TO GET TO- CARBON NEUTRALITY WITHOUT CARBON CAPTURE AND STORAGE. THE THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION- I. I BELIEVE I MEAN I BELIEVE THAT I. YOU COULD PROBABLY STILL DO IT. BUT IT WOULD REQUIRE- A RANGE OF YOU KNOW ADDITIONAL EXPENSIVE TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE ALSO NOT WIDELY COMMERCIALIZED. ALL RIGHT I DON'T SEE A REASON TO TAKE IT OFF THE TABLE I WOULDN'T SAY DEFINITIVELY THAT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE WITH. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH TO VISIT MOUNT MAHONE- FOR YOU FOR YOUR- YOUR TIME TODAY. THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT HI I KNOW THAT WE HAVE OR NOT- OTHER PANELISTS PATIENTLY WAITING TO BUT- OUR NEXT SPEAKER FOR OUR FIRST PANEL IS ERIN MAYFIELD. ASSISTANT PROFESSOR AT DARTMOUTH COLLEGE'S THAYER SCHOOL OF ENGINEERING. TO PRESENT VIRTUALLY FONG- HER- NOW ZERO AMERICA REPORT. A PROFESSOR MAYFIELD. I SEE YOUR GRAPHICS SHOWING ON OUR SCREEN. DO WE HAVE YOU ON MIKE. LOOKING YES WE CAN WELCOME THANK YOU VERY MUCH TO THE COMMITTEE FOR THE INVITATION AND THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU TODAY ABOUT TO CARBONIZED THINGS ECONOMY TO MINIMIZE THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE I WILL TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS THE NET ZERO AMERICA PROJECT CARRIED OUT BY A PRINCETON LED RESEARCH TEAM THIS PROJECT EVALUATED ALTERNATIVE PATHWAYS TO ACHIEVE NET ZERO EMISSIONS IN THE UNITED STATES BY MID CENTURY. AND WE EVALUATED NOT ONLY THE TECHNICAL AND COST ASPECTS BUT WHAT DO THESE TRANSITIONS MEAN FOR AMERICANS IN TERMS OF IMPACTS SUCH AS ENERGY AFFORDABILITY ENERGY SECURITY JOBS LAND USE THEIR QUALITY. BY WAY OF MY BACKGROUND. ALLEGE MY RESEARCH IS IN THE AREAS OF SUSTAINABLE SYSTEMS ENGINEERING AND PUBLIC POLICY AND I CURRENTLY SERVE AS AN AUTHOR ON THE FIFTH NATIONAL CLIMATE ASSESSMENT. PRIOR TO ACADEMIA I WORKED FOR SEVERAL YEARS AS A PRACTITIONER WORKING WITHIN IN OVERBURDEN AND LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES ON HAZARDOUS WASTE REMEDIATION ENVIRONMENTAL EDUCATION. AND INFRASTRUCTURE PLANNING. SO I WILL GIVE A VERY HIGH. LEVEL OVERVIEW OF CALIFORNIA'S ROLE IN MEETING A US WIDE NET ZERO EMISSIONS GOAL ELECTRIC POWER GENERATION IN CALIFORNIA OUT TO TWENTY FIFTY IT'S ALWAYS ABOUT YOU WAITED A REFERENCE CASE WHICH ESSENTIALLY ASSUME STATIC POLICIES IN ADDITION TO ALTERNATIVE THAT ZERO PATHWAYS. SO AS YOU CAN SEE IN THE FOR NETZERO SCENARIOS PRESENTED IN WE MODELED MANY OTHER SCENARIOS AS WELL OUR GENERATION EIGHTEEN INCREASES TO MEET INCREASING ELECTRICITY DEMAND RESULTING FROM THE ELECTRIFICATION OF TRANSPORTATION. RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERCIAL BUILDINGS AND BEING IN POSSESSION OF PROPERTIES. YOU CAN SEE THAT THE FIRST TEN YEARS OF THE TRANSITION ARE SIMILAR ACROSS ILLNESS IT'S ZERO SCENARIOS WITH ISSUE MAKING USE OF NATURAL GAS AND INCREASING RENEWABLES ESPECIALLY SOLAR. AND BY TWENTY THIRTY AND EVEN MORE SAVES SO BY TWENTY OR TWENTY THIRTEEN EVEN MORE SO BY TWENTY FORTY THE PATHWAY START TO DIVERGE BASED ON THE RATE OF ELECTRIFICATION OF ENERGY DEMANDS AS WELL AS THE ABILITY TO PLAY EVERITT. RENEWABLES THE EIGHT EIGHT PLUS OR EIGHT PLUS A SCENARIO FOR EXAMPLE ASSUMES A WHERE AS THE EPLUS ARI MINUS SCENARIO ASSUMES THAT THE ABILITY. TO DEPLOY RENEWABLES IS CONSTRAINED AND NATURAL GAS WITH CARBON CAPTURE- TAKES A MUCH LARGER ROLE IN MEETING ELECTRICITY DEMAND. COULD YOU GIVE A QUICK EXPLANATION OF THE E. PLUS THE ARIA YOUR YOUR- YOUR YOUR- ABBREVIATIONS HERE. SURE THE RAFT IS OUR REFERENCE SCENARIO RIGHT SO IT'S NOT MEETING AFTER- TARGETS- STATIC POLICY CASE ESSENTIALLY AND THEN THERE'S THE FOR SET NET ZERO SCENARIOS EACH CLASS IS- WHAT THE- COST EFFECTIVE POLICY. ALL ARE COST EFFECTIVE POLICIES BUT IT'S ENOUGH CONSIDERING THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE POLICY I'M- A AND THERE'S A HIGH RATE OF ELECTRIFICATION E. MINUS- BEARS. A LOWER RATE OF ELECTRIFICATION- ECLASS ARE YOU PLUS IS THE MOUNTIE PLUS EXCEPT FOR- REQUIRING THAT BY TWENTY FIFTY WERE MEETING A 100% RENEWABLE OVER 100% RENEWABLE TARGET. AND EPLUS ARI MINUS IS MEANT TO BE THE OTHER SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN CASE ON. RENEWABLES AND INCREASED. THE NATURAL GAS AND NATURAL GAS WITH BROTHER NATURAL GAS A CARBON CAPTURE RIGHT SO- THESE ALL DIFFER IN TERMS OF THE RATE OF ELECTRIFICATION AND THE MAGNITUDE OF RENEWABLE DEPLOYMENT- SO. I WOULD ALSO SAY THAT FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF OVERALL ANNUALIZED ENERGY SYSTEM COSTS AS A PERCENTAGE OF GDP ARE LOWER FOR ALL NATURAL PATHWAYS ACROSS FOR A U. S. Y. A RELATIVE TO A REFERENCE CASE SCENARIO OVER THE LONG TERM THIS IS OF COURSE CONTINGENT ON ROBUST LONG TERM PLANNING POLICY AND THE ABILITY TO MORE LOCALIZED INVESTMENT CAPITAL TO DEPLOY CRITICAL AND INTEGRATED INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS. SO THESE TRANSFORMATIONS ARE SUBSTANTIAL FROM AN INFRASTRUCTURE PERSPECTIVE IT'S ON A NATIONAL LEVEL THE DEPLOYMENT RATES OF SOLAR WIND AND GREAT INFRASTRUCTURE. ARE MUCH HIGHER IN ALL OF THEIR NET ZERO SCENARIOS THAN HISTORICAL PEAK DEPLOYMENT RATES SO FOR THE U. S. HISTORICAL. GREAT WAS ABOUT TEN GIGAWATTS PER YEAR. ROSS THE DIFFERENT AT ZERO SCENARIOS THAT WE MODEL. FIFTEEN TO EIGHTY GIGAWATTS PER YEAR ON AVERAGE ACROSS THE US WILL HAVE TO BE DEPLOYED AND THAT RATE IS UPWARDS OF EIGHT TIMES A START WILL PEAK RATE SO OUR RATES ARE REQUIRED. UP FOR WINDOW CROSS THE LAST. SO TO PUT IT INTO OTHER CONTEXTS IN THE FIRST FIVE YEARS OF THE TRANSITION THE DEPLOYMENT RATE OF SOLAR AND WIND WILL HAVE TO BE A PUBLIC TO THE STARKEL MAXIMUM DEPLOYMENT RATE THAT WE'VE OBSERVED IN THE US AND IN THE FIVE YEARS AFTER THAT TO TWENTY THIRTY THIS DEPLOYMENT RATE WILL HAVE TO DOUBLE THE DEPLOYMENT RATE CONTINUES TO ACCELERATE THEIR AFTER. THERE'S IN A SIMILAR. PATTERN FOR TRANSMISSION CAPACITY ACROSS THE US WHICH NEARLY TRIPLES BY TWENTY FIFTY AND TO CONTEXTUALIZE THIS AND TALK ABOUT A HUNDRED FIFTY YEARS TO BUILD THE CURRENT GRADE. AND NOW WE'RE WE HAVE TO BUILD THAT MUCH TRANSMISSION IN THE NEXT FIFTY YEAR FIFTEEN YEARS AND THEN AGAIN. IN THE FIFTEEN YEARS AFTER THAT. COME TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL CONTEXT OF THE SCALE OF THESE TRANSITIONS THIS MAP IS A SMOKE TWENTY TWENTY SNAPSHOT OF UTILITY SCALE SOLAR WHICH IS SHOWN IN. AN ORANGE WIND IN BLUE AND TRANSMISSION IN IN GRAY. AND THIS IS A SNAPSHOT IN TWENTY FIFTEEN FOR THE ECLASS NETZERO PATHWAY THAT WE MODELED SO THIS IS ONE POTENTIAL DEPLOYMENT- OF BUSINESS ZERO PATHWAY. THAT IS RELATIVELY MODERATE IN TERMS OF RENEWABLE DEPLOYMENT SO SOLAR AND WIND COMPRISE ABOUT 80% OF ELECTRICITY SUPPLY ACROSS THE U. S. BY TWENTY FIFTY WHICH EQUATES TO A TEN FOLD INCREASE IN SOLAR AND WIND CAPACITY OVER THE NEXT. THIRTY YEARS. OF COURSE THERE'S MANY ALTERNATIVE DIPLOMA PATHWAYS OF SOLAR WIND AND TRANSMISSION INFRASTRUCTURE IN CALIFORNIA AND REGIONALLY AND THAT WILL IMPACT OR BE INFLUENCED BY EQUITY AND JUSTICE LAND USE ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL OBJECTIVES. BEYOND RENEWABLE INFRASTRUCTURE WE ALSO EVALUATED TRANSITION OF SEVERAL OTHER TYPES OF INFRASTRUCTURE INCLUDING THE DEPLOYMENT OF C. CO TWO PIPELINES AND FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS AND RIPARIAN. SO THERE WILL ALSO BE SUBSTANTIAL IMPACTS TO LOCAL AND REGIONAL ECONOMIES AND SO THIS FIGURE SHOWS. THAT POTENTIAL FUTURE OF JOB GAINS AND JOB LOSSES AGGREGATED BY RESOURCE SECTOR SO IT INCLUDES ALL SUPPLY SIDE ENERGY RELATED JOBS IN IN CALIFORNIA. SO THERE'S A NET JOB GAIN- IN IN GRADE RELATED JOBS WHICH IS STRONGER BROWN SOLAR JOBS AND IN YELLOW. AND GREEN JOBS IN BLUE. AND THERE'S A NET LOSS IN OIL AT IN RED AND NATURAL GAS JOBS IN PURPLE STONE AGGREGATE INTERVIEW PLUS SCENARIO. THEIR JOB GAINS OFFSET JOB LOSSES BUT IN REALITY THOSE- WHO LOSE JOBS MAY NOT TRANSITION INTO JOBS IN OF THE LOW CARBON WORKFORCE. THIS IS WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE IN OTHER POTENTIAL FUTURES AND SO YOU CAN SEE A RAPID GROWTH IN THE ENERGY SECTOR EVEN EVEN AT BURKE COUNTING FOR ANY INCREASES IN LABOR PRODUCTIVITY ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASING AUTOMATION LEARNING- AND LABOR ECONOMIES OF SCALE. HE'S LABOR TRANSITIONS MUCH LIKE THE INFRASTRUCTURE TRANSITIONS MUST BE PLANNED DID MANAGE TO MITIGATE RISKS AND ACTUALIZE BENEFITS FOR WORKERS AND COMMUNITIES AS WELL AS REDUCE TRANSITION RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH DECARBONISATION. THERE'S FEEDBACK BETWEEN OUR LABOR MARKETS TECHNOLOGY COSTS AND ULTIMATELY HOW WE CHOOSE TO DEPLOY TECHNOLOGIES AND THE BILITY TO TRANSITION- IS ALSO GOING TO BE INFLUENCED BY A LOCATION ON OCCUPATIONAL COME FROM TERRY'S FROM EMERGING AND DECLINING IN INDUSTRIES. IN ADDITION TO HOW TRANSITIONS ARE MANAGED AND PLANNED INCLUDING SUSTAINED WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THE WORKERS AS WELL AS AND MITIGATE LABOR SUPPLY BOTTLENECKS. IN A RECENT RELATED STUDY WE ALSO SHOW THAT IMPLEMENTING HIGHROAD LABOR PRACTICES AND POLICIES SUCH AS PAYING FAIR WAGES AND INCREASING DOMESTIC CONTENT SHARES OF RENEWABLE PRODUCTS SUCH AS SOLAR PANELS AND WIND TURBINES WILL NOT SLOW THE PACE OF. THE TRANSITION NOR WILL IT SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASED COSTS. THERE WILL BE MANY IMPACTS FROM TRANSITIONING ECONOMY TO MEET NET ZERO EMISSIONS BY MID CENTURY AMONG THOSE BE EVALUATED AIR POLLUTION BENEFITS FROM REDUCED EMISSIONS OF PRIMARY FINE PARTICULATE MATTER AND PRECURSOR POLLUTANTS. CURRENT ERROR- POLLUTION IMPACTS FROM FINE PARTICULAR MATTER IN CALIFORNIA ARE REGRESSIVE SO IT'S AT THE LOWEST INCOME PEOPLE HAVE THE HIGHEST MORTALITY RATES FROM AIR POLLUTION AND IN THE NEXT DECADE ALONE BY MOVING TOWARDS A NET ZERO TARGET. BETWEEN FIVE HUNDRED TWO THOUSAND MORTALITIES WILL BE AVOIDED AND CALIFORNIA LARGELY STEMMING FROM TO KERR MISSING THE TRANSPORTATION TO AND RESIDENTIAL SECTORS IN THE STATE THIS IS A QUICKLY TWO FOUR TO FIFTEEN BILLION DOLLARS IN AVOIDED AIR POLLUTION DAMAGES. OVER THE NEXT THIRTY YEARS THE CUMULATIVE AVOIDED MORTALITIES ARE ON THE ORDER OF THIRTY THOUSAND. TO SEVENTY THOUSAND- APPOINTED MORTALITIES IN CALIFORNIA ALONE. AND HOW WE TRANSITION OUR INFRASTRUCTURE THOUGH WILL INFLUENCE WHO- BENEFITS AND THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT ON DIFFERENT POPULATIONS ALTERNATIVE PATHWAYS TO MEET THAT ZERO EMISSIONS BY TWENTY- FIFTY AND IMPORTANTLY WHO DERIVE THE BENEFITS AND WHO BEARS THE COST FROM CLIMATE MITIGATION WILL BE INFLUENCED BY HOW WE TRANSITION OUR INFRASTRUCTURE AND WITHOUT AND I'M HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS. THANK YOU PROFESSOR MAYFIELD- IT AYE I RECEIVED A REQUEST TO THAT- IT BECAUSE SO YOU- COMMITTEE MEMBERS MAY HAVE TO. IT TOO TO LEAVE EARLY WHAT WOULD YOU BE ABLE TO. TO STAY IT GIG CAN WE HAVE ALL OF OUR PRESENTERS PRESENT AND THEN. COME BACK TO YOU FOR QUESTIONS. THAT'S FINE YES OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ALL RIGHT- SO- WITH THAT- I'D LIKE TO INVITE TO. OUR NEXT PRESENTER- FOUR PANEL TO TRADE OFFS OF ACCELERATED ACTION IN SPECIFIC SECTORS- PERHAPS WELL I THINK I WAS GONNA INVITE ALL THREE TWO TO COME AT THE TABLE BUT I GUESS THAT MAY VIOLATE OUR- OUR ONGOING COVERT PRECAUTIONS AND SO- LIKE TO INVITE TO THE- DOCTOR CHRIS BUSH. A RESEARCH DIRECTOR WITH ENERGY INNOVATION. REMOVE THIS THAT'S OKAY WITH EVERYONE WE AN HEAR YOU THANK YOU. GOOD- OKAY. A REBEL CHAIR VICE CHAIR DISTINGUISHED MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR THE WORK OF THIS COMMITTEE IN THE PRIVILEGE OF ADDRESSING YOU TODAY I UNDERSTAND YOU HAVE MY PRESENTATION IN HARD COPY IN FRONT OF YOU- SAUGUS STARTED IF THAT'S OKAY- CALIFORNIA'S CLIMATE. POLICY LEADER FOR THE UNITED STATES IN THE WORLD. BUT WE'RE NOT ON TRACK TO MEET OUR TWENTY THIRTY OR TWENTY FORTY FIVE GOALS. THIS IS ALL THE MORE WORRISOME BECAUSE CALIFORNIA ALSO MUST STRENGTHEN OUR FUTURE TARGETS TO ALIGN WITH THE LATEST SCIENCE. CALIFORNIA IS ALSO ON TRACK TO DELIVER CLEAN AIR FOR ALL OUR RESIDENTS BY TWENTY THIRTY. AND THOSE SUFFERING FROM AIR POLLUTION TYPICALLY CONTRIBUTE THE LEAST AND CAN LEAST AFFORD TO ESCAPE IT. OF COURSE THERE'S GOOD NEWS AS WELL OUR ELECTRIC POWER SECTOR IS JUST DECARBONIZING AT INCREDIBLE SPEED IN CALIFORNIA POLICY PLAYED A CRITICAL ROLE. IN JUMP STARTING THE ELECTRIC VEHICLE MARKET. NOW THE STATE MUST DO THE SAME TO SPEED THE ADOPTION OF HEAT PUMPS IN BUILDINGS AND INDUSTRY. PHASING OUT FOSSIL FUELS AND REPLACING THEM WITH CLEAN AFFORDABLE ENERGY ENERGY SOURCES CAN HELP CALIFORNIA BUILD A STRONGER FAIRER ECONOMY. AMBITIOUS POLICIES WILL SPUR A NEW WAVE OF INNOVATION AND ENTREPRENEURIAL ISM AND CLEAN TECHNOLOGIES INCREASING IN DEMAND WORLDWIDE. ELECTRIFICATION POLICIES REDUCE CALIFORNIA'S EXPOSURE TO VOLATILE FOSSIL FUEL PRICES A NOTABLE ADVANTAGE WHEN GAS PRICES ARE SPIKING DUE TO RUSSIA'S WAR AGAINST UKRAINE. MY TESTIMONY SPOTS LIKE THE SPOTLIGHTS THE POTENTIAL TO ELECTRIFY ENERGY USE IN FOOD PROCESSING ONE OF CALIFORNIA'S LARGEST INDUSTRIES AND URGES FASTER TRANSPORTATION ELECTRIFICATION AS WELL. CALIFORNIA'S LEADERSHIP HAS PROVIDED CRUCIAL MOMENTUM FOR INTERNATIONAL CLIMATE EFFORTS BUT WE MUST NOT RELENT. HUMANITY STILL HAS A CHANCE TO LIMIT GLOBAL WARMING TO ONE POINT FIVE DEGREES CELSIUS THIS I JUST URGE BUT SUCCESS HINGES ON CALIFORNIA'S RECOMMITMENT TO BE AT THE FOREFRONT. OF AMBITION. SO WITH THAT LET'S MOVE ON TO THE SECOND SLIDE SLIDE WHICH- LOOKS AT THE STATE'S EMISSION INVENTORY BACK TO ITS ORIGIN IN THE YEAR TWO THOUSAND. AND ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE SHOWS FIGURES GRAPHING FIVE TEN AND TWENTY YEAR MISSION REDUCTION POINT TRENDS SHOWING LITTLE ACCELERATION IN THOSE TRENDS OVER TIME. MOVING TO THE NEXT SLIDE. TITLED LOOKING FORWARD NOT ON TRACK. THIS GRAPH PROJECTS THE FIVE YEAR EMISSION REDUCTION TREND FORWARD SHOWING THAT REACHING OUR EXISTING TWENTY THIRTY TARGET WILL REQUIRE MORE THAN TRIPLING THE ANNUAL ANNUAL REDUCTION RATE COMPARED TO THE FIVE YEAR TREND IN THE MOST RECENT DATA. THE FACT THAT WE ARE NOT ON TRACK FOR THE TWENTY THREE TARGET UNDERLINES THE LIMITATIONS AND ASSEMBLY BILL THIRTY TWO SCOPING FINAL SCOPING PLAN LANGUAGE. ONLY NEW STATUTORY LANGUAGE CAN INSURE ECONOMY WHY TARGETS ARE TRANSLATED INTO POLICY ACTION. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE THE ONE TITLED CALIFORNIA ENERGY POLICY SIMULATOR. AND THE N. THE OBVIOUS NEED FOR STRONGER ACTION DOES NOT TRANSLATE TO SIMPLE CHOICES FOR POLICY MAKERS I DON'T NEED TO TELL YOU THAT. ENERGY INNOVATION DEVELOPED ARE CALIFORNIA ENERGY POLICY SIMULATOR TO HELP IDENTIFY THE MOST EFFECTIVE AND SOCIALLY ADVANTAGEOUS POLICY COMBINATIONS. ARE OPEN SOURCE MODEL IS AVAILABLE AT CALIFORNIA DOT ENERGY POLICY DOT SOLUTIONS AND IS FREELY DOWNLOADABLE THE CALIFORNIA EPS MODELS AFFECTS OF THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM AND SECTOR SPECIFIC POLICIES SUCH AS THE LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD AND WHEN RENEWABLE PORTFOLIO STANDARD. WE ARE UPDATING OUR MODEL AND A DISSIPATED THIS IN THE NEXT QUARTER QUARTER. ENERGY INNOVATION RELEASED THE FIRST VERSION OF OUR MODEL IN EARLY TWENTY TWENTY EVALUATING THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN SCOPING PLAN STRATEGY WE CONCLUDED EXISTING POLICIES WERE UNLIKELY TO DELIVER TWENTY THIRTY SUCCESS. WE OFFERED RECOMMENDATIONS EVERY MAJOR SECTOR TO CLOSE THIS POLICY GAP. AND NOW MOVE ON TO THE- SLIDE ENTITLED ELECTRIFICATION OPPORTUNITY IN FOOD PROCESSING. AND SEVERAL OF OUR RECKLESS RECOMMENDATIONS- FROM THE CALIFORNIA EPS MODELING ARE NOW REFLECTED IN CURRENT POLICY ONE THAT'S NOT YET ADOPTED UP VERGES AS ZERO EMISSION STANDARD TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF EXISTING TECHNOLOGIES FOR ELECTRIFYING INDUSTRY HEAT. THIS LIGHTS SPOT LIGHTS IN ELECTRIFICATION OPPORTUNITY. BECAUSE FOOD PROCESSING CONSUMES MORE NATURAL GAS THAN ANY CALIFORNIA INDUSTRY EXCEPT FOR OIL INCLUDING EXTRACTION AND REFINING. THESE DATA ILLUSTRATE THAT FOOD PROCESSING STANDS OUT FOR ITS DEMAND FOR LOW TEMPERATURE HEAT WHICH IS READILY SERVED BY HEAT PUMPS EXISTING TECHNOLOGY. HEAT PUMPS BUT HE BLOW 100 DEGREES CELSIUS REPRESENTS OVER 40% OF HEAT REQUIRED FOR FEW PROP FOOD PROCESSING MORE THAN ANY OTHER INDUSTRY. STRONGER POLICY IN INDUSTRY IS NEEDED BECAUSE OF SURPLUS ALLOW SUPPLY IN CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM A KEY INDUSTRY POLICY. THE INDEPENDENT MISSION MARKET ADVISORY COMMITTEE RECENTLY FOUND THE PRIVATE BANK OF ALLOWANCES HAS GROWN TO EXCEED THREE HUNDRED MILLION TONS. IN ADDITION TO OVERSUPPLY CONCERNS CONTINUING FREE ALLOCATION TO CALIFORNIA INDUSTRY UNDERCUTS THE EFFECTIVENESS OF CARBON PRICING WHICH LISTS SEVERAL- EQUIPMENT AND DEVICE LIFETIMES. CALIFORNIA SHOULD STRIVE FOR ALL NEW CAR SALES TO BE ZERO EMISSION AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE BECAUSE EVERY NEW GAS POWERED CAR THE ROAD. CREATES FUTURE LIABILITIES THIS CALIFORNIA DRIVES TOWARDS CARBON NEUTRALITY THE TIME OF INVESTMENT WHEN BUSINESSES ARE CHOIR NEW CAPITAL EQUIPMENT OR WHEN CONSUMERS ARE BUYING CARS AND FURNACES. IS A CRUCIAL TIME FOR POLICY BECAUSE OF THESE MACHINES LASTING TEN YEARS OR MORE. THIS MOMENT OF REPLACEMENT CREATES A POLICY WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY FOR EMISSION REDUCTIONS. ONCE PEOPLE INVEST IN FOSSIL FUEL MACHINES THEY TAKE ON A LIFE OF THEIR OWN FORCING MACHINES INTO EARLY RETIREMENT IS MUCH MORE DIFFICULT AND COSTLY THAN SHARING CLEAN INVESTMENTS IN THE FIRST PLACE. NEXT I'D LIKE TO LOOK AT A SLIDE UP ENTITLED LEARNING CURVES IN INNOVATION OPPORTUNITIES. AND IT IT IT IT POINTS TO THE GROWING UP SIDES OF THE EASY TRANSITION- AND THAT'S ANOTHER REASON CALIFORNIA HAS TO EXCEL RATE THE TIMETABLE AND EV'S ALREADY SAVING CONSUMERS ON FUEL AND MAINTENANCE AND WILL SOON COST LESS DUE TO LEARNING CURVE EFFECTS WHICH QUANTIFY HOW GREATER EXPERIENCE WITH EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES. RESULTS IN LEARNING BY DOING AND ECONOMIES OF SCALE THIS GRAPH SHOWS HOW EASY BATTERY PACK COSTS OF FALL DECADE AND PROMISING ALTERNATIVE BATTERY CHEMISTRIES AN ADDITIONAL KIND OF MUSE A SCALAR REASONS TO EXPECT CONTINUING INNOVATION AND FALLING COSTS FOR BATTERIES. I'D LIKE TO DRAW YOUR ATTENTION TO THE RED CURVES IN THIS GRAPH IN PARTICULAR WHICH SHOW PAST FORECASTS OF INFLUENTIAL ENERGY ECONOMY MODELERS SUCH AS THE- INTERNATIONAL ENERGY AGENCY. THESE PAST FORECASTS FAILED TO ANTICIPATE CONTINUED INNOVATION AND ILLUSTRATE THAT CLEAN TECH FOR COST FORECASTS ARE ALMOST ALWAYS TOO CONSERVATIVE. A NOTABLE EXCEPTON IS WORK BY PROFESSOR KAMAN AND COLLEAGUES. USING TWENTY FIFTEEN DATA HE AND CO AUTHORS HARNESS THE POWER OF LEARNING CURVES T FORECAST TWENTY TWENTY E. V. BATTERY PACK PRICES WITH 98% ACCURACY. NOW CLOSING WITH THE SLIDE CALLED THE EEVEE INTO THE V. INDUSTRY AS A CASE STUDY IN ECONOMIC UPSIDES IT. SHOWS THE ALL TOO OFTEN IGNORED ECONOMIC UPSIDES OF THE STATE'S CLIMATE POLICY LEADERSHIP. TODAY CALIFORNIA BOASTS MORE THAN NINETEEN THOUSAND AUTO MANUFACTURING JOBS DOUBLE THEIR HISTORICAL LEVELS. AND OVERALL THE EEVEE INDUSTRIES CREATED OVER TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND DIRECT JOBS PAYING AN ANNUAL WAGE OF NINETY ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS ACCORDING TO THE L. A. COUNTY ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION. AND WITH THAT I'LL CONCLUDE MY TEST TESTIMONY AND LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING FROM MY FELLOW PANELISTS AND- TO THE DISCUSSIONS TO COME LIKE WITH THE- FIRST MAYFIELD WE APPRECIATE IF- I BEGAN HAVING UP TO ASK QUESTIONS THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT NEXT- LIKE TO INVITE THE- DR REBEKAH DEL. PROGRAM DIRECTOR FOR CLIMATE WORKS FOUNDATION. IS THIS ALL. YEAH OKAY GREAT. SO I'D LIKE TO START BY THANKING THE MEMBERS OF THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEE ON CLIMATE CHANGE POLICIES FOR ALL THE HARD WORK THAT THEY DO ON BEHALF OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND FOR GIVING ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO COME AND DISCUSS THIS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT ISSUE TODAY. THE ISSUE BEFORE US OF WHETHER TO ACCELERATE CALIFORNIA'S CLIMATE TARGETS AND CLIMATE ACTIONS COULD NOT BE MORE IMPORTANT- I'D LIKE TO EMPHASIZE THE CRITICAL ROLE OF CALIFORNIA'S INDUSTRIAL SECTOR. IN THIS POLICY PROCESS. AND FOCUS ON THE FOLLOWING THREE POINTS. FIRST CALIFORNIA CANNOT MEET. ITS CLIMATE GOALS WITHOUT DRAMATICALLY DECREASING ITS INDUSTRIAL GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. SECOND CALIFORNIA'S MANUFACTURING SECTOR IS ESSENTIAL TO THE SUCCESS OF ITS ECONOMY AND THE WELL BEING OF ITS CITIZENS SO ALL OF OUR ACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL EMISSIONS SHOULD BE DESIGNED TO SUPPORT AND INCREASE THE SUCCESS OF MANUFACTURING IN OUR STATE. AND THIRD THE CEMENT INDUSTRY PRESENTS A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS MULTIPLE GOALS. REDUCING OUR STATE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS INCREASING OUR GLOBAL GREENHOUSE GAS LEADERSHIP MAINTAINING OUR MANUFACTURING BASE AND IMPROVING PUBLIC HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ALL AT THE SAME TIME. SO LET ME TAKE THOSE THREE POINTS ONE. AT A TIME AND DIVE A LITTLE DEEPER ON EACH STARTING WITH THE IMPORTANCE OF CALIFORNIA'S INDUSTRIAL EMISSIONS. ALMOST A QUARTER OF CALIFORNIA'S GREENHOUSE GASES COME FROM INDUSTRY. THIS IS SIMPLY TOO MUCH TO LEAVE TO THE SINGLE POLICY MECHANISM OF THE CAP AND TRADE SYSTEM. THESE EMISSIONS ARE ROUGHLY SPLIT BETWEEN THE UPSTREAM MIDDLES ARE MIDSTREAM AND DOWNSTREAM EMISSIONS OF THE OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY. AND MANUFACTURING ACTIVITIES. MOST OF THE TRAJECTORY OF THE OIL AND GAS SECTORS GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS WILL BE DETERMINED BY WHAT HAPPENS IN THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR. AND NOT AT THE INDUSTRIAL SITES THEMSELVES SO I'M GONNA FOCUS THE REST OF MY REMARKS ON THE EMISSIONS FROM MANUFACTURING ACTIVITIES. SO WHICH BRINGS ME TO MY SECOND POINT CALIFORNIA'S MANUFACTURING SECTOR IS SOMETHING THAT WE CAN ALL BE JUSTLY PROUD OFF. HI IT PRODUCES APPROXIMATELY THREE HUNDRED FIFTY BILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR IN ECONOMIC OUTPUT THIS IS THE LARGEST MANUFACTURING SECTOR OF ANY STATE IN THE UNITED STATES. AND THAT'S NOT JUST BECAUSE OUR ECONOMY IS THE LARGEST WE ACTUALLY HAVE A LARGER PERCENTAGE OF OUR STATE ECONOMIC OUTPUT COMING FROM MANUFACTURING. THEN THE U. S. ECONOMY AS A WHOLE- FUSING. AT LEAST AS IMPORTANT AS THE OVERALL IMPACT ON OUR OUR ECONOMIC OUTPUT IS THE QUALITY OF THE JOBS THAT THE MANUFACTURING SECTOR GENERATES THE TOTAL COMPENSATION OF THE AVERAGE MANUFACTURING WORKER IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS A HUNDRED TWELVE THOUSAND DOLLARS PER YEAR. THIS IS WAY ABOVE AVERAGE AND AS SUCH. AW THE CALIFORNIA THE MANUFACTURING% SECTOR PROVIDES CRITICAL LADDER INTO THE MIDDLE CLASS FOR A WIDE VARIETY OF CALIFORNIANS INCLUDING THOSE WHO DON'T HAVE THE BENEFIT OF A COLLEGE EDUCATION. HOWEVER IN SPITE OF ALL OF THIS BY FAR THE SIMPLEST AND MOST DIRECT ROUTE TO DECARBONIZE OUR MANUFACTURING SECTOR IS ALSO THE WORST IT'S SIMPLY TO SHUT DOWN THE FACILITIES. THAT WOULD ELIMINATE THE EMISSIONS DIRECTLY BUT IT WOULD CAUSE ALL MANNER OF OUR ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL PROBLEMS HERE IN CALIFORNIA WELL FAILING TO ACTUALLY REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS ON A GLOBAL BASIS COMBINATION OF POLICIES. THAT REQUIRE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS AT FACILITIES WITH AND USE THOSE IN COMBINATION WITH POLICIES THAT CREATE BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE CLEANEST FIRMS. WHEN POLICIES THAT SUPPORT INNOVATION IN TECHNOLOGY MARKETS AND BUSINESS MODELS. SO FINALLY TO ILLUSTRATE HOW ALL OF THIS MIGHT WORK I WANT TO FOCUS FOR THE LAST FEW MINUTES OF MY- TESTIMONY ON THE CEMENT SECTOR. THE CEMENT SECTOR IS THE LARGEST SOURCE OF MANUFACTURING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WITH BETWEEN TWO AND THAT LEVEL IT'S ESSENTIAL THAT WE REDUCE THESE EMISSIONS. JUST IN ORDER TO MEET OUR OVERALL CHEMICALS THAT'S THAT'S TOO MANY TONS OF GREENHOUSE GASES FOR US TO IGNORE. HOWEVER GLOBALLY THE CEMENT SECTOR IS RESPONSIBLE FOR BETWEEN SEVEN AND 8% OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. SO IF CALIFORNIA CONTENT DEMONSTRATE TECHNICAL POLICY AND BUSINESS FEASIBILITY OF GENUINELY LOW OR NEAR ZERO GREENHOUSE GAS CEMENT PRODUCTION. THAT'S A HUGE OPPORTUNITY FOR GLOBAL LEADERSHIP THIS IS A REALLY HIGH LEVERAGE OPPORTUNITY FOR CALIFORNIA SO WE NEED TO DO IT FOR IT FOR OURSELVES. BUT IT'S A GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO CONTRIBUTE TO SOLVING THE PROBLEM GLOBALLY- AS OF RIGHT NOW NO ONE HAS FIGURED OUT HOW TO HAVE A GENUINELY ZERO OR NEAR ZERO GREENHOUSE GAS CEMENT INDUSTRY. SO CALIFORNIA CAN BE A TRAILBLAZER HERE. IN ADDITION TO THESE CONSIDERATIONS ALL I TWO MORE FIRST. AS WE JUST HEARD FROM ALL OF THE PREVIOUS SPEAKERS IN ORDER TO MEET OUR OVERALL ECONOMY WIDE CLIMATE GOALS WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO BUILD A LOT OF STUFF WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO BUILD NEW HOUSING NEW INFRASTRUCTURE NEW TRANSMISSION LINES ALL OF THAT IS GOING TO REQUIRE CEMENT AND CONCRETE WE DO NOT WANT OUR ACTIONS. TO ADDRESS CLIMATE CHANGE TO THEMSELVES BECOME DRIVERS OF ADDITIONAL GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS THROUGH THE DIRTY BUILDING MATERIALS THAT ALL OF THIS CLEAN STUFF IS MADE OUT OF CALIFORNIA ARE NOTABLY DIRTY IN THE SENSE THAT THEY ARE THEY HAVE A DISPROPORTIONATE A MISSIONS OF THE LOCAL POLLUTANTS ARE BOTH CRITERIA AIR POLLUTANTS AND AIR TOXICS THAT HAVE A VERY MALIGN EFFECT ON THE COMMUNITIES THAT LIVE AROUND THEM CEMENT KILNS ARE THE ONLY FACILITIES LEFT IN CALIFORNIA THAT STILL RELY PRIMARILY ON BURNING COAL FOR THEIR ENERGY AND POTS- AND BECAUSE THESE ARE RELATIVELY SMALL FACILITIES AND BECAUSE SO MUCH OF THE ATTENTION HAS BEEN FOCUSED ON POWER GENERATION. AW THEY'VE CUT THEY'VE MANAGED TO SLIP BY UNDER THE RADAR FOR MANY YEARS. SO FOR ALL THESE REASONS CEMENT IS CRITICAL. AND TO DO IT WE NEED A COMPREHENSIVE POLICY APPROACH WE CAN BUILD ON THE FOUNDATION FROM CAP OF CAP AND TRADE APPS BY INCREASING AND BETTER TARGETING THE FINANCIAL INCENTIVE TO CAP AND TRADE CREATES TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND ADDRESS THE OVERHANG OF BANK EMISSIONS THAT BOB MY COLLEAGUES ON THE PANEL ALREADY MENTIONED. SECOND. WE NEED TO SUPPORT INNOVATION ARE UNLIKE MANY INDUSTRIES LESS THAN HALF OF THE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS FROM THE CEMENT INDUSTRY COMES FROM ENERGY EMISSIONS WITH MOST COMING FROM THE RAW MATERIALS IT'S LITERALLY CO TWO COMING STRAIGHT OUT OF THE ROCKS. AND AS SUCH ALL THE CLEAN ENERGY IN THE WORLD WILL AT BEST GET US MAYBE 40% EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS FROM THIS CRITICAL SECTOR. SO INNOVATION IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT HERE. AND WE'VE HAD A LOT OF DISCUSSION TODAY ABOUT CARBON CAPTURE AND STORAGE. AND MY ATTITUDE IS. IF WE HAVE OP IF WE DECIDE EVEN IF WE DECIDE THAT WE DON'T WANT TO USE CARBON CAPTURE AND STORAGE IN ANY OTHER PART OF OUR ECONOMY. THE PLACE WHERE IT IS MOST LIKELY TO BE ESSENTIAL TO MEETING OUR CLIMATE GOALS IS IN THE CEMENT INDUSTRY- SO IF WE WANT TO TAKE ACTION ON. FIFTY S. CEMENT IS THE PLACE TO START- SO WE NEED TO SUPPORT TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION DIRECTLY- AND TO FACILITATE EARLY DEPLOYMENTS WITH THINGS LIKE SUPPORTING INFRASTRUCTURE BOTH FINANCIALLY AND ALSO SUPPORTING AND NECESSARY INFRASTRUCTURE PLANNING AND PERMITTING REGULATORY SUPPORT FOR GEOLOGICAL STORAGE- AND TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE ABUNDANCE FEDERAL MONEY FROM THE RECENT INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT AND JOBS ACT. THAT IS AVAILABLE TO STATES WHO WISH TO BE AGGRESSIVE ON THIS TOPIC AND I WANT TO POINT OUT THE CALIFORNIA CEMENT COMPANIES. ALONG WITH CALIFORNIA LABOR UNIONS. AND CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS ALL REALIZE THE NEED FOR THIS ACTION. THE CEMENT COMPANIES UNDERSTAND WHICH DIRECTION HISTORY IS MOVING IN AND THEY WOULD LIKE TO DECARBONISE THE FACILITIES PROVIDED THAT WE CAN CREATE A POLICY SITUATION. THAT ALLOWS THEM TO DO THAT WITHOUT LOSING MONEY. FINALLY WE NEED POLICIES THAT CREATE MARKETS FOR CLEAN CEMENT. CALIFORNIA IS A GLOBAL LEADER IN ITS BY CLEAN POLICY TO BUY CLEAN BUILDING MATERIALS FOR STATE FUNDED TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS WITHOUT POLICY ACTUALLY EXEMPTS THE MOST IMPORTANT BUILDING MATERIAL NAMELY CEMENT OR CONCRETE- WE SHOULD ALSO BE EXPLORING POLICIES. LIKE THE CLEAN PRODUCT STANDARDS ADDRESSING EMBODIED CARBON THROUGH OTHER AN INTERESTING ADDRESSING EMBODIED CARBON IN THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT THROUGH OTHER MECHANISMS LIKE THROUGH OUR BUILDING CODES. SO IN THE UC CONCLUSION WE NEED TO DDRESS INDUSTRIAL GREENHOUSE GASES IT'S NOT OPTIONAL WE NEED TO DO IT IN A WAY THAT SUPPORTS AND STRENGTHENS OUR MANUFACTURING SECTOR. AND A COMPREHENSIVE POLICY APPROACH INCLUDING REGULATION INNOVATION AND MARKET CREATION IS A WAY TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME AND I LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH LAST BUT NOT LEAST TOOK- WE WOULD LIKE TO- INVITES TO DOCTOR DAN KAMIN PROFESSOR OF ENERGY- UC BERKELEY. MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I'D LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR THE CHANCE TO SPEAK TODAY I REALLY APPRECIATE THE WORK THAT YOU'RE DOING BECAUSE AS YOU'VE HEARD FROM A COMBINATION OF MODELING PERSPECTIVES TODAY AND FROM SPECIFIC SECTORAL APPROACHES WE NEED TO ACCELERATE THE ACTIVITIES IN CALIFORNIA NOT ONLY FOR OUR OWN BENEFIT BEFORE THE GOAL BENEFIT. AND THAT REALLY STARTS WITH THE WORK OF THIS COMMITTEE SO I WILL TRY TO SKIP OVER ELEMENTS OF MY OF MY COMMENTS THAT WERE ADDRESSED BY OTHERS I GUESS I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT TWO THINGS THAT I HEARD CLEARLY IN THE OF IN THE PRIOR TO SPEAKERS DR BUSH INTO A DOCTOR DEL. AND THAT IS WE HAVE SPECIFIC SECTORAL OPPORTUNITIES THAT WILL NOT UNFORTUNATELY EMERGE FROM LARGE SCALE MODELING EFFORTS I AM MYSELF A PHYSICIST AND ENERGY MODELER I'VE BEEN DOING ENERGY MODELING FOR TWENTY YEARS MALAI SWITCH MODEL IS ONE OF THE ONES THE STATE IS USED OVER AND OVER AGAIN IT'S BEEN SUPPORTED BY THE CCV ARP OVERTIME. AND MODELS ARE INHERENTLY CONSERVATIVE AND I DON'T MEAN WE DON'T LOOK AT SCENARIOS THAT ARE FAR AND WIDE WHAT I MEAN IS THAT MODELS TEND TO BE REACTIVE. WHEN SOMETHING GOES RIGHT LIKE THE PUSH TO ELECTRIC VEHICLES OR EFFORTS TO DEPLOY HEAT PUMPS OR BATTERIES. MODELS GRAB ONTO IT AND PROJECT DRAMATIC IMPROVEMENTS OVER TIME. THAT'S WHAT WE DO WHETHER IT'S THE INTERNATIONAL ENERGY AGENCY THE E. THREE MODEL MICE WHICH MODEL THE REFLEX MODEL ANY OF THEM. THAT'S NOT A CRITICISM OF MODELS. WHAT MODELS ARE BEST AT IS CHARTING LEAST COST LEAST RISK STRATEGIES NOT ACTUALLY IN LAYING OUT BOLD ACTIONS TO BEGIN WITH SO I WANTED TO SPEND A MINUTE. CONGRATULATING THE STATE FOR WHAT WE'VE DONE BECAUSE I THINK IT REALLY SETS THE OPPORTUNITY IN THE AGENDA AND I GO BACK TO SOME OF THE BILLS THAT- OF THAT THAT THAT THAT THAT AFTER JUST OUTRAGEOUS ANTI SKINNER PASSED IN OTHERS THAT HIGHLIGHTED AGGRESSIVE ACTIVITIES IN RESTAURANTS AND SOME OF THE THINGS THAT- THAT CENTER BECKER HAS DONE IN TERMS OF LOOKING ECONOMY WIDE. WHEN CALIFORNIA PASSED SB ONE THE MILLION SOLAR ROOF MANDATE. THE GLOBAL STATEMENT WAS IT'S NOT POSSIBLE IN THE TIME TO SEE IN THE TIME SCANNED CALIFORNIA SENATE. WE MET THAT GOAL. WHEN CALIFORNIA SET THE GOAL FOR MILLION ELECTRIC VEHICLES WE DIDN'T MAKE IT EXACTLY THE TEN YEARS. BUT YOU CAN ARGUE THAT NOT ONLY THAT MANDATE BUT MANY OF THE OTHER PIECES THE LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD THAT I HELPED TO WRITE A NUMBER OF OTHER FEATURES. BROUGHT NOT ONLY A MILLION ELECTRIC VEHICLES TO CALIFORNIA. BUT IT ALSO ACCELERATE THE GLOBAL PROSPECTS. I WORKED HARD ON ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY FIVE FOURTEEN THE CALL FOR THE ONE POINT TWO GIGA WATTS OF ENERGY STORAGE IN CALIFORNIA BY TWENTY TWENTY. SOMETHING THAT WAS ALSO SAID TO BE IMPOSSIBLE. WE NOW IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE HAD THE MOSS LANDING STORAGE PLANT. GO ONLINE WITH PLANS TO EQUAL THE ENTIRE CAPACITY. OF TWENTY FIVE FOURTEEN ONE POINT TWO GIGAWATTS BY TWENTY TWENTY BY THE END OF THIS YEAR OR EARLY NEXT YEAR. THOSE ARE ALL ACTIONS THAT I WISH WE AS ENERGY MODELERS HAD FORECAST. BUT IN EVERY SINGLE CASE WE DID NOT. WHAT HAPPENED IN EACH CASE WAS A BOLD ACTION BY A MIXTURE OF CALIFORNIA SENATE ASSEMBLY COMMITTEES. CONVERSATIONS WITH INDUSTRY TO HIGHLIGHT WHAT WAS POSSIBLE I KNOW THAT'S THE HISTORY YOU WILL KNOW. BUT IT'S CRITICAL IN THINKING THROUGH THE NEXT STEPS TO GET US BACK ON TRACK AS AS DR BUSH'S AS AS HIGHLIGHTED WE NEED TO DO THAT AND THE CRITICAL MESSAGE OF MY TESTIMONY. IS THAT WHILE CALIFORNIA IS NOT CURRENTLY ON PATH TO MEET THOSE TARGETS. GETTING ON THOSE ARE GETTING BACK ON THAT PATHWAY WILL BE GOOD FOR THE CLIMATE GOOD FOR THE LOCAL ENVIRONMENT THE MOST CRITICALLY GOOD FOR CALIFORNIA JOBS. AT THE POINTS THAT WE WERE PUSHING THOSE SOLAR STORAGE AND OTHER MANDATES. CALIFORNIA WAS BRINGING IN UP 240% OF TOTAL NATIONAL FUNDING FOR VENTURE CAPITAL THE CLEANTECH SPACE. THAT IS FULL OF THE THAT'S THE OPPORTUNITY ON THE LEGACY HERE AND SO AGAIN I'M TO SKIP OVER MANY OF THE DETAILS BUT TO TRY TO REMAIN ON TARGET. LET ME JUST HIGHLIGHT ONE LAST POINT AND THEN GO TO A SET OF RECOMMENDATIONS. THE FIRST IS THE CALIFORNIA'S UNFORTUNATELY DONE ITSELF SOME SIGNIFICANT RECENT DAMAGE. ONE OF THOSE AREAS IS THE WELL MEANING BUT VERY PROBLEMATIC DETAILS. OF THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION PROPOSED RULING ON SOLAR. THAT HAS DESTROYED CONFIDENCE IN THE AGGRESSIVE MOVING FORWARD IN SOLAR. AND WITH SOLAR AND WIND NOW THE CHEAPEST NEW FORMS OF ENERGY TECHNOLOGY SOMETHING WE HEAR ALL THE TIME BUT THE CONTEXT IS IT IS NOW CHEAPER TO BUILD NEW SOLAR AND WIND ENERGY FACILITIES. THEN IT IS TO OPERATE FOSSIL FUEL PLANTS. AND EVEN WHEN WE ADD IN STORAGE TO THAT MIX SO SOLAR PLUS STORAGE OR WIND PLUS STORAGE THOSE FACILITIES ARE ALSO NOT ONLY CHEAPER. BUT THEY GENERATE TWENTY TO A 100% MORE JOBS IN THE FOSSIL FUEL OPPORTUNITIES AND THIS I THINK IS ONE OF THE REALLY EXCELLENT POINTS THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER OF FLOOR BROUGHT UP AND THAT IS. SOME OF OUR OPPORTUNITIES GOING FORWARD OR DO INVEST IN THE AREAS THAT ARE THE CAPITAL WHERE WE HAVE THE DENSITY OF DEMAND. BUT IT'S TO REALLY BUILD UP OTHER PARTS OF CALIFORNIA'S BASE. TO BECOME LEADERS IN THESE OTHER AREAS SO FAR TO RUN THROUGH QUITE QUICKLY THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT I LISTED ON THE SECOND PAGE OF MY TESTIMONY. FIRST AND SEVERAL PEOPLE HAVE SAID VERSIONS OF IT. CALIFORNIA SHOULD BRING FORWARD TO THE TWENTY THIRTY FIVE DATE FOR THE END OF SALES OF NEW INTERNAL COMBUSTION VEHICLES TO TWENTY THIRTY OR EARLIER ALREADY THE UNITED KINGDOM AND MASSACHUSETTS IN WATCHING OUR ACTIONS HAVE MOVED TO THAT DATE KILLER IT IS NOT AN ANTI RURAL A STATEMENT IT IS A STATEMENT OF INVESTING IN INNOVATION BECAUSE THE AREAS WHERE WE NEED. NEW VEHICLE TECHNOLOGIES- TRIED ARE IN THE AGRICULTURE SECTOR AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER- FLOOR HIGHLIGHTED THEIR FOR HEAVY INDUSTRY THERE TO WORK AT PORTS INVEST IN ELECTRIC VEHICLES ANY NEAR TERM OPPORTUNITIES FOR HYDROGEN VEHICLES. VERY RECENTLY UNITED KINGDOM HAS DEVOTED ITS LARGEST AND TUSKER INDUSTRIAL CLUSTER. THE HUMBER CLUSTER TO BECOME AN ENTIRELY GREEN HYDROGEN FUNDED OPPORTUNITY AND MAKE IT GETS BACK TO THE BUT THE POINT MADE BY SOMEBODY MEMBER GARCIA. ABOUT THE NEED TO INVEST AND TO DEAL WITH THE SO CALLED DOCKER. IN FACT THE WORRISOME DOCKER. HAS BECOME AN OPPORTUNITY WHAT WE ONCE LOOKED AT FROM THE MODELING PERSPECTIVE AS A CHALLENGE OF FINDING VALUE FOR CLEAN ENERGY BECAUSE OF A SMALL THE LOW MARGINAL COST FOR CLEAN ENERGY DURING THE DAY. HAS BECOME AN OPPORTUNITY TO POWER VEHICLES AND TO MAKE HYDROGEN WHEN THE DEMAND FOR ELECTRICITY IS LOW. THAT LEADS TO ONE OF THE OF MY OTHER RECOMMENDATIONS AND THAT IS THIS COMMITTEE WORKING WITH THE PLANNING COMMITTEE IS WORKING WITH- WITH WITH THE U. S. NAVY. NEEDS TO ACCELERATE OUR DEPLOYMENT PLANS FOR OFFSHORE WIND. OFFSHORE WIND IS A HUGE RESOURCES FOR THE WESTERN UNITED STATES IN PARTICULAR CALIFORNIA. AND LAST WEEK'S AUCTIONS OF EAST COAST- BLOCKS FOR OFF SHORE WIND BROUGHT IN FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IN THE LONG RUN EIGHTY THOUSAND NEW JOBS THAT'S ROUGHLY EQUIVALENT TO THE U. S. TO THE CALIFORNIA SOLAR INDUSTRY TODAY. AGGRESSIVELY MOVING HALL FORWARD ON PILOT PROJECTS IN OFFSHORE WIND WILL GENERATE CLEAN ELECTRICITY WHEN DEMAND IS HIGH AND CLEAN HYDROGEN WHEN DEMAND IS LOW. CALIFORNIA SHOULD ALSO WORK AGGRESSIVELY WITH THE U. S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE TO TRY TO OVERTURN- OR TO WORK AROUND THE HIGHLY UNFORTUNATE DECISION BY LOUISIANA JUDGE TO BLOCK THE SOCIAL COST OF CARBON. ONE OF THE WAYS THAT CALIFORNIA CAN BE A LEADER IN THIS AREA IS TO UTILIZE A SOCIAL COST OF CARBON THAT REFLECTS RACIAL SOCIAL GENDER JUSTICE INTO OUR OWN ANALYSIS. OVER AND OVER AGAIN THAT WILL HIGHLIGHT THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR CALIFORNIA FARMERS. CALIFORNIA JUST REAL SECTOR AND THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO WHAT CALIFORNIA'S 35% OF OUR CAP AND TRADE MONIES THAT ARE DEVOTED TO UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES AND NOW THE PRESIDENT BIDEN'S JUSTICE FORTY TO INVEST 40% WILL WILL BRING TO INDUSTRY. IN CALIFORNIA HOUSING POLICY IS CLIMATE POLICY WE MAKE THE LOWEST INCOME PEOPLE DRIVE THE FURTHEST TO WORK IT IS RACIALLY SOCIALLY AND GENDER UNFAIR IT LIMITS OUR WORK FORCE AND IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY WHERE. INVESTING IN MIXED HOUSE MIXED ABOUT MULTI UNIT HOUSING IN TRADITIONAL SINGLE FAMILY HOUSING AREAS IS A MOVEMENT TOWARDS JUSTICE BOTH FOR INDIVIDUALS AND FOR THE CLIMATE INTO OUR LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD CALIFORNIA SHOULD NOT ONLY DO THE RESEARCH FOR WHICH WERE ALREADY A LEADER BUT SHOULD BEGIN TO IMPLEMENT SUSTAINABLE MATERIALS POLICIES AS WE HEARD IN IN THE PRIOR TESTIMONY. THAT WILL ENSURE THAT FOR BATTERY MATERIALS FOR SOLAR MATERIALS FOR ADVANCED VEHICLES WE SOURCE SOCIALLY RACIALLY ENVIRONMENTALLY JUST MATERIALS. WE ALREADY KNOW THERE ARE MAJOR AUTOMAT MANUFACTURERS FROM FORD TO B. M. W. TO OTHERS HIGHLIGHTING THIS HAVING THE LARGEST VEHICLE MARKET UNITED STATES CALIFORNIA. SETTING STANDARDS IN THESE AREAS WILL ACCELERATE THE PUSH TOWARDS SUSTAINABLE- ACCESS TO LITHIUM COBALT OTHER CRITICAL MATERIALS YOU'LL OPEN THE MARKET JUST THE WAY CALIFORNIA'S LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD. FINAL OPPORTUNITY AREA AND THAT IS TO INVEST IN JUST HER BEADED MINI GRIDS IN PARTICULAR FOR RURAL AREAS AND FOR UNDERSERVED INCORPORATED AREAS- BUT EVEN FROM URBAN AREAS MANY GRADES PROVIDE. RESILIENCE THEY PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES TO MEET DEMANDS WITHOUT THE CHALLENGES OF WILDFIRES THEY ALSO PROVIDE ECONOMIC JOBS IN THE MOST UNDERSERVED AREAS. ANY OR ALL OF THESE AREAS ARE RIGHT FOR THE KINDS OF BOLD OPPORTUNITIES I HIGHLIGHTED THE BEGINNING AND I'D BE DELIGHTED TO WORK WITH THE COMMITTEE DOWN THE ROAD TO IMPLEMENT ANY OF THESE THAT YOU LOOK AS AS PRIME TARGETS FOR YOUR ACTION I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE TIME TO SPEAK. AND I LOOK FORWARD TO ANSWERING ANY QUESTIONS OF THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH DOCTOR KAMAN I UNDERSTAND. I CAN BE I THANK ALL THE PANELISTS HAVE BEEN. PATIENT TO IN OUR DIRECT THE QUESTION UNTIL AFTER THE PRESENTATIONS BRIAN SO YOU MAY HAVE TO LEAVE OF COURSE I DO I HAVE A TWELVE O'CLOCK FEDERAL TESTING. OKAY ALL RIGHT SO YOU YOU'RE NOT AVAILABLE FOR ANY QUESTIONS I CAN STAY FOR A BIT I TOLD I'M NOT THE FIRST WITNESS AND IT'S A THREE PM START SO IN THE EAST COAST SO I DON'T MAKE IT LATER OKAY. WITH THE OF THE- INDULGENCE OF THE OTHER PANELISTS TO IT DR CAM AND ANY QUESTIONS FOR A- DOT KAMAN. IS IDEA THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR YOUR YOUR PRESENTATION CAN YOU- GO BACK AND REPEAT WHAT YOU SAID OR YOUR STATEMENT ABOUT THE PC AND SOLAR AND THE LACK OF TRUST. YEP FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO THE PROPOSED DRAFT RULING THAT WOULD HAVE TAXED SOLAR RETROACTIVELY AND WOULD HAVE ESSENTIALLY CLAWED BACK SOME OF THE GAINS FROM SOLAR. HAS ELEMENTS THAT MAKE ECONOMIC SENSE WE RECOGNIZE THAT THE NET METERING WERE- REGULATIONS NEED TO BE UPDATED. BUT PUTTING A BRAKE ON SOLAR WHICH IS EFFECTIVELY WHAT THE P. YOU SEE RULING WOULD HAVE DONE. WOULD ESSENTIALLY BE AKIN TO KILLING THE GOLDEN GOOSE IN THE SENSE OF SOLAR HAS NOW BECOME FROM THE MOST EXPENSIVE TECHNOLOGY DECADES AGO TO THE LEAST EXPENSIVE TODAY. IT'S THE AREA WE WANT TO WE WANT TO REWARD THE MOST DISTRIBUTED GENERATION. FROM INDIVIDUAL HOMES TO PUBLIC HOUSING PROJECTS TO INTEGRATING SOLAR INTO SMALL AND MEDIUM BUSINESSES ALL OF THOSE OPPORTUNITIES NOT ONLY DEPLOYED MORE SOLAR. BUT THEY- WITH TODAY'S ECONOMICS THEY FACILITATE THE INTERACTION OF ENERGY STORAGE AND IN FACT THE FASTEST GROWING COMBINATION OF NEW ENERGY GENERATION IN CALIFORNIA. IS DEPLOYMENT OF INTEGRATED SOLAR PLUS STORAGE TECHNOLOGIES. THAT'S AN OPPORTUNITY THAT WE DON'T WANT TO MISS OUT ON OR SEND SIGNALS TO THE PRIVATE SECTOR THAT WE ARE NOT THE MOST OPEN THE MOST. SOCIAL JUSTICE RACIALLY PROGRESSIVE PLACE TO INSTALL THE COUNTRY AND IN FACT LAST YEAR WAS THE FIRST YEAR THE CALIFORNIA. LET LOST THE TOP SPOT IN THE IN THE MOST AMOUNT OF DISTRIBUTED SOLAR DEPLOYED TEXAS IS NOW AHEAD OF US AFTER. FOR THE ENTIRE HISTORY OF SOLAR WE BEING IN THE FIRST PLACE. AND THAT THAT COST US JOBS AND THAT ALSO COST US COMPANIES THAT WOULD LOCATE HERE AND SO BY HIGHLIGHTING THE FACT THAT THE BATTLE WERE HAVING OVER THE P. YOU SEE- THAT THAT THE P. YOU SEE PROPOSED DECISION. IS ONE THAT IS SENT A NEGATIVE SIGNAL THE INDUSTRY ABOUT THE CLARITY THAT CALIFORNIA IS THE FIRST PLACE THEY SHOULD INVEST HAS HEARD US ON THE JOBS BASIS AND THAT'S REALLY THE BASIS FOR MY COMMENT THERE. THERE IS ONE ELEMENT OF THE POSE RULING THAT I STAND STRONGLY IN FAVOR OF AND THAT IS CARVING OUT A FUND. THAT WOULD BE MANAGED BY A PUBLIC. ASSEMBLY AND PRIVATE SECTOR GROUP TO INVEST IN ENERGY STORAGE FOR LOWER INCOME COMMUNITIES. SO THAT WE DON'T. LIKE MANY OTHER TECHNOLOGIES HAVE THEM THE LAST COMMUNITIES TO RECEIVE THE LATEST TECHNOLOGY THAT'S ONE OF THE KEY AREAS THAT I THINK NEEDS TO BE PRESERVED BUT WE NEED TO FIND A WAY. TO BRING THIS TOGETHER SO THAT. THE PC CAN MOVE FORWARD UTILITIES RECEIVE CREDIT FOR DISTRIBUTED SOLAR WHICH RIGHT NOW THEY ESSENTIALLY DO NOT RECEIVE- AND TO MOVE THAT INDUSTRY EVEN AT A HIGHER GEAR NOW THAT IT'S BECOME SO LOW COST. THAT THANKS FOR THE QUESTION. I'M NOT. I HAVE A FOLLOW UP FOR YOU IN TERMS OF HOW DO WE ADDRESS SOME OF THE MOST- SOME OF THE CONCERNS RELATED TO LOW INCOME FAMILIES AS WE MOVE FORWARD TO FULLY ATTAINING SOMETHING THAT WE ALL HOPE TO ACHIEVE WHICH IS 1100% RENEWABLE AND WE HAVE. A GOAL OF TWENTY FORTY FIVE AND OFTEN WANT TO MOVE FORWARD I REPRESENT A COMMUNITY THAT IS SURROUNDED BY FREEWAYS AND SO CLEAN AIR- YOU KNOW BEING ABLE TO REDUCE OUR ASK MARIE IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO OUR CMMUNITY AND RENEWABLE ENERGY IS CLEARLY THE DIRECTION THAT WE SHOULD GO I AM HOWEVER- GONNA PUT SOMETHING ON YOUR RADAR AND I AND I HOPE THAT YOU THOUGHT ABOUT THIS. AND THAT'S A MAY TWENTY TWENTY ONE REPORT BY THE P. YOU SEE BY AN INDEPENDENT AUDITOR THEN THE REPORT IS CALLED THE UTILITY COSTS AND AFFORDABILITY OF THE GRID OF THE FUTURE AND ON PAGE THIRTY IS SIMPLY STATES THE EVALUATION STUDY FOUND THAT AS COMPARED TO THE GENERAL CALIFORNIA POPULATION NAME CUSTOMERS ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY OLDER LOCATED IN HIGH INCOME AREAS LIKELY TO OWN THEIR OWN HOME AND LESS LIKELY TO LIVE IN A DIS AND LESS LIKELY TO LIVE IN A DISTANT. A DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY CONSEQUENTLY THE COST OF NUMBER DISPROPORTIONATELY PAID BY YOUNGER LESS WEALTHY AND MORE DISADVANTAGED REPAIRS MANY OF WHOM ARE RENTERS AND SO TO ADDRESS ALL OF THESE CONCERNS THAT YOU SEE IS CONSIDERING A RESTRUCTURING OF NUMBER TO PUT-NO WHICH IS WHAT YOU ARE SAYING THIS HAS DENTED THE TRUST. OF THE SOLAR INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA WE ARE ALL CONCERNED WHAT WHAT THE FUTURE LOOKS LIKE I REPRESENT A DISTRICT THAT IS 20% BELOW THE NATIONAL POVERTY LINE WHY SHOULD LOW INCOME FAMILIES AND RENTERS PAY FOR THE DIFFERENCE WHAT IS THE SOLUTION THAT WE SHOULD BE CONSIDERING AN EFFORT TO ENSURE THAT SOLAR IS NOT JUST SOLELY FOR INDIVIDUALS THAT OWN THEIR HOMES BUT WHAT ARE THE INCENTIVES THAT WE SHOULD BE CONSIDERING US WE AND AS WE TRY TO. EXPAND THE GRID. I WE TRY TO REDUCE CONSUMPTION SOME FOSSIL FUELS. BUT THE COST SHOULD NEVER BE ON THE BURDEN OF LOW INCOME FAMILIES AND THE POOR AND RENTERS WHAT IS YOUR- RESPONSE IS THIS IS A GREAT QUESTION THANKS FOR THANKS FOR RAISING IT SO- THAT SECTION YOU REFER TO WAS PARTIALLY BASED ON A STUDY THAT MY LABORATORY DID WITH GOOGLE. WHERE WE LOOKED AT WHO HAD SOLAR ACROSS THE COUNTRY FOUND IS THAT ACROSS AN ORDER OF MAGNITUDE OF INCOME FROM FAMILIES JUST BELOW THE POVERTY LINE TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR FOR A FAMILY OF FOUR WHICH OF COURSE IS NOT AFFORDABLE IN CALIFORNIA. TO A QUARTER MILLION. WHAT THE WHOLE RANGE. WHITE MAJORITY NEIGHBORHOODS WERE 50% MORE LIKELY TO HAVE SOLAR. LET NECKS IN AFRICAN AMERICAN NEIGHBORHOODS WHERE 5275% LESS LIKELY TO HAVE SOLAR. FROM THE LOWEST INCOME TO THE HIGHEST INCOME AND I'D BE HAPPY TO SEND THAT REPORT AFTERWARDS IF YOU IF YOU LIKED IT IF ELECTED. TO TAKE A LOOK AT IT. WHAT WE FOUND UNFORTUNATELY WAS THAT MANY OF THE POLICIES THAT WERE USED TO. DEPLOY SOLAR. INVESTING IN SOME SMALL COMPANIES INVESTING IN SOME REAL ESTATE COMPANIES. FOLLOWED THE OLD MODEL. OF INVESTING IN. IN A LARGELY CAUCASIAN DOMINATED COMPANIES. AND THEY'VE DEPLOYED PRIMARILY A AND LIKE COMMUNITIES. AND SO FROM HOUSING COMPANIES TO SMALL SCALE SOLAR WE REPEATED. THE FAILED MODEL OF THE PAST WE ALSO KNOW. THAT FICUS SCORES ARE USED IN PRETORIA WAYS AGAINST MINORITY COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND IN CALIFORNIA. AND EVEN SOME POLICY IS ONE THAT I HELPED DESIGN CALLED PACE FINANCING. FROM A LATE LARGE STUDY LOS ANGELES WE FOUND IT WAS USED AS A PREDATORY TOOL AGAINST A LOW INCOME. MINORITY AN OLDER HOME OWNERS. SO THAT'S A HORRIBLE LEGACY OF NOT MOVING TO THE BENEFITS AND SO. I WOULD SAY THERE ARE SEVERAL OPPORTUNITIES TO ADDRESS WHAT YOU SAID ONE IS. THE CALIFORNIA DOES HAVE OUR CAP AND TRADE FUNDS WHICH WILL NOT FUND ALL OF THIS. BUT THERE ARE GREAT FIRST LEVER. CALIFORNIA DEVOTES 35% OR MORE OF THOSE FUNDS TO MINORITY FENCE LINE. MOST EXPOSED COMMUNITIES BUT THAT'S A FLOOR NOT A CEILING- CENTER WHEN HE WAS SENATOR- CENTER PART TIME- KEVIN DE LEÓN HIGHLIGHTED THAT THAT FLOOR WAS DESIGNED TO RISE. THE FEDERAL NUMBER. BUT BASED ON OUR TOTAL IS 40% OF FEDERAL SPENDING CALIFORNIA COULD UP THE FRACTION OF MONEY FROM THE CAP AND TRADE. THAT IS DEVOTED TO THESE FIRST PROJECTS IN LOW INCOME AREAS LIKE IN YOUR DISTRICT. AND ONE OF THE REAL OPPORTUNITIES. IS TO A SO THE SOAK SOLARGARDEN LAWS SO THAT YOU NEED NOT BE A PROPERTY OWNER TO TAKE ADVANTAGE. LOCAL STORES SUCH AS GROCERY STORES HAVE OFFRED SEVERAL TIMES TO HOST SOLAR. AND THAT COULD BE USED TO OFFSET UTILITY BILLS WHERE THAT THE ARRANGEMENT WOULD BE A PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN LAND OF PROPERTY OWNERS AND THE RENTERS TO SPLIT THE BENEFITS OF SOLAR RISING IN USING THESE OFF SITE LOCATIONS TO DO SO. THAT'S ONE OF THE TOOLS THAT THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY HERE. THE SECOND ONE IS TO LOOK AT THE MODEL THAT LIFT HAS PILOTED BUT HASN'T MOVED AGGRESSIVELY ENOUGH YET ON AND THAT IS TO MAKE ELECTRIC VEHICLES. AVAILABLE FOR PURCHASE OR FOR LEASE AT OR BELOW COST THAT'S A NATURAL AREA FOR CALIFORNIA TO SUBSIDIZE ELECTRIC VEHICLES TO BE EXCESS EXCESS BY LOW INCOME MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY BECAUSE TYING ELECTRIC VEHICLES TO LOCAL GREEN GENERATION IS ALSO WAY. TO DROP THE LARGEST PART OF MOST PEOPLE'S BILLS WHICH IS TRANSPORTATION. SO I THINK THAT THE ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE SAID OF OPPORTUNITIES IS IN FACT ARGUABLY OUR MOST EXCITING SET BECAUSE THAT'S THE ONE WE'VE SADLY DONE THE LEAST ON SO I THINK THIS IS AN AREA WHERE CAN A MENU OF. OF JUST TRANSITION OPPORTUNITIES WOULD MOST ACCELERATE THE CALIFORNIA'S MOVEMENT BUT WOULD ALSO PUT THE BENEFITS INTO THE LEAST OF THAT HISTORICALLY DISCRIMINATED AGAINST PARTS OF THE STATE. HI MY NAME IS RICHARD THANK YOU FOR THE INDULGENCE. THE ELECTRIC VEHICLE CONVERSATION IS INTERESTING IN AREAS WHERE YOU ARE NOT A HOMEOWNER YOU DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO A GARAGE WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO ACTUALLY CREATE. THE PLUGIN FOR YOUR VEHICLE SO IF WE ARE LOOKING AT- RESIDENCY APARTMENTS. WHAT IS THE WHAT IS THE INCENTIVE FOR THE OWNER OF AN APARTMENT COMPLEX TO BE ABLE TO PUT IN. SOLAR FOR THE RENTERS- IN THAT BUILDING YEAH I THINK THERE'S TWO ASPECTS AND THEY'RE THEY'RE TIED TOGETHER. THE FIRST IS THAT AGAIN THESE BILLS THAT UPS THAT HAVE BEEN WORKED ON THE SO CALLED SOLAR GARDENS BILLS ARE DESIGNED TO SPLIT THE INCENTIVE THAT THE HOME OF THAT THE PROPERTY OWNER GETS AN INCENTIVE AS LONG AS- THE SAVINGS. BY GOING TO ELECTRICITY ARE. PASSED ON TO RENTERS IN THERE BILLS THAT HAS. ISSUES THAT YOU CAN'T DO IT ALL AT THE STATE LEVEL THERE'S ALSO LOCAL JURISDICTIONS JURISDICTION ASPECTS. BUT IT'S ONE OF THE OPPORTUNITIES. THE OTHER PART IS WHAT YOU HIGHLIGHTED IN TERMS OF THE EEVEE PART OF THAT STORY. I CURRENTLY RUN A PROJECT FUNDED BY THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION. CALLED THE ECO BLOCK AND IT TAKES A LOW INCOME FORTY HOME AND APARTMENT BLOCK IN OAKLAND. ELECTRIFY IS BY PUTTING SOLAR ON THE ROOF BUT IT'S A SHARED RESOURCES SO IT DOES NOT POWER THE HOMES DIRECTLY. IT GOES INTO A SHARED ENERGY STORAGE FACILITY THAT POWERS THE HOMES. POWERS PUBLICLY AVAILABLE EASY CHARGING IN THE REGULAR STREET SIDE PARKING AREAS AND THEN THE EXTRA POWER BEYOND THAT IS THEN SOLD BACK TO P. JEANNIE. THE EAGLE BLOCK IS AN EXAMPLE OF A MIXED USE WHERE THERE ARE SOME PROPERTY OWNERS ON THE BLOCK IT'S IN THE FRUITVALE SECTION OF OAKLAND. AND THERE ARE PERMANENT BUILDINGS ON THE BLOCK AS WELL. ALMOST EVERYONE WHO OWNS AN EEVEE LARGELY THEM THE MORE AFFLUENT WIDER. BOB PUBLISHED IN CALIFORNIA. REPORTS THAT DID YOU ALMOST ALL OF THEIR CHARGING AT HOME. SO WITHOUT MAKING THAT CHARGING AVAILABLE AT CONVENIENT. RACIAL DISPARITY THANKFULLY THE GOVERNOR'S- A TEN BILLION DOLLAR COMMITMENT TO ELECTRIC VEHICLES JUST RECENTLY ANNOUNCED IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO DISPROPORTIONATELY PUT THAT MONEY BOTH TO MAKING EVEY CHARGINGAVAILABLE WHERE RENTERS LIVE AND ALSO TO SUBSIDIZING THE PURCHASE OR LEASE OF ELECTRIC VEHICLES FOR LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS NOT MORE AFFLUENT CALIFORNIANS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL IS INTERESTING ESPECIALLY IN THE RECOGNITION THAT LOW INCOME FAMILIES ARE LOW INCOME AREAS IN GENERAL DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO WHAT WE ARE CONSIDERING WILL BE THE VERY NEAR FUTURE OF CALIFORNIA RIGHT MY DAD DRIVES A OLD NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE TOYOTA PICKUP. AND SO I THINK ABOUT COMMUNITIES LIKE MINE I THINK ABOUT MY DAD WOULD DRIVE THIS TRUCK HOW IS HE GOING TO ONE BE ABLE TO AFFORD IN YOUR VEHICLE TO WHERE IS HE GOING TO PLUG IT IN AND MANY FAMILIES LIKE THAT SO I'M CURIOUS IF THERE'S A WAY THAT WE CAN LOOK AT THAT POTENTIAL BUDGET PROPOSAL. AND THINK OF IT- THREE CENSUS TRACTS THE CENSUS CAN GIVE US AN OPPORTUNITY TO LOOK AT WHERE ARE THE AREAS THAT HAVE THE MOST NEED WHERE THE AREAS AND WE SHOULD POTENTIALLY FOCUS ON AND HOW CAN WE CREATE EQUITY AND THIS NEW CONVERSATION ABOUT RENEWABLE ENERGY WHICH IS. I THINK THE MOST IMPORTANT AND MISSING PIECE IN THIS ENTIRE PROCESS. THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THAT UP AND SO I'M GONNA GO BIT OFF SCRIPT HERE- I HAVE A FAVORITE POLICY BUT AGAIN IT'S ONE FOR THE COMMITTEE TO LOOK AT AND IT'S A FEE BASED POLICY. AND THAT IS AS WE LOOK AT VEHICLES AS A FUNCTION OF COST OR AS A FUNCTION OF CARBON EMISSIONS. WE ATTACH A FEE TO THOSE THAT WE WANT TO DISCOURAGE AND WE TRANSFER THAT TO THE PURCHASE BY PEOPLE FOR IN AREAS WE WANT TO ENCOURAGE. AND THAT CAN BE SIMPLY A POLICY WHERE YOU HAVE KIND OF A SYMMETRIC WE TAX ON ONE SIDE WE GIVE THE OTHER SIDE. BUT THERE'S NO REASON WHY THAT CAN'T BE BASED ON INCOME. SO THE IDEA THAT WE COULD CRAFT A FEE BAIT. TO ENCOURAGE ELECTRIC VEHICLES. BUT TARGETED. YOU TOO LOW INCOME MEMBERS OF OUR COVER COMMUNITY. TO MY OWN ST UP MY OWN OPINION MAKES A GREAT DEAL OF SENSE AND IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY THAT'S BEEN DISCUSSED IN THE PAST. WE DID NOT ACT ON IT- I THINK IT'S ONE OF THE TOOLS THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO US RIGHT NOW BECAUSE WHERE IT'S BEEN TRIED SUGGESTED IRELAND AND FRANCE AND FRANCE IN THE BONUS MALUS SYSTEM. IT'S BEEN VERY EFFECTIVE. HOW MANY YOU CAN TARGET AGAIN WITH THE ONE YOU SENSE THIS TRACTOR AREAS ARE PURELY INCOME. THOSE ARE ALL OPPORTUNITIES THAT ARE THERE ARE NOT PROHIBITED. AND THANKFULLY THE CAP AND TRADE MONEY. IS FAIRLY UNRESTRICTED IN THIS AREA BECAUSE OF THE REQUIREMENT FOR A BI MENTAL JUSTICE SO THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD A POLICY HERE. I SUSPECT EVERYONE AROUND THE ROOM NOT EVERYONE WOULD BE AS EXCITED ABOUT- THE FE BATES AS I AM BUT IT'S ONE OF THE WAYS THAT WE CAN MOVE THE MONEY MOST DIRECTLY. AND THAT OF COURSE FEEDBACK. BECAUSE THE MORE WE PUSH FOR ELECTRIC VEHICLES THE MORE IT MAKES OUR CLEAN ENERGY STANDARDS EFFECTIVE AND SO WE GET AIR QUALITY BENEFITS. WE GET JOBS BENEFITS WE ALSO PUSH MORE FOR THE MANUFACTURING OF VEHICLES. THE MEDIA MORE DIVERSE RANGE OF NEEDS NOT JUST KIND OF. TESLA'S IN AFFLUENT NEIGHBORHOODS BUT WORKING VEHICLES. THANK YOU- ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FOR YES CENTER BACK UP I'LL JUST KEEP IT. THANK YOU SO MUCH I. AGREE WITH WHAT YOU SAID- I'M TO ASK ABOUT THE SAME A MATERIALS CODE AND- WE CAN TAKE IT OFF OR DO SOMETHING TO IT. YOU CAN SHARE WITH US ON THAT IDEA BECAUSE NOT WHEN I HAD BEEN FAMILIAR WITH. YES ONE THAT'S ACTUALLY STILL UNDER UNDER DISCUSSION IN A VARIETY OF AREAS MASSACHUSETTS IS LOOKING AT IT- GERMANY AND FRANCE ARE BOTH LOOKING AT IT. BUT THE IDEA WOULD BE TO BUILD SOMETHING VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT WE HAVE IN THE LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD. AND THAT IS A GRAMS OF CO TWO EMISSION PER MATERIAL IN THE END. AND SO IF WE LOOK AT SOME OF THE MOST DAMAGING ASPECTS OF MINING FOR LITHIUM FOR COBALT. AN ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE AND A CARBON STANDARD. IS SOME OF THE VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT WE'VE ALREADY WORKED THROUGH IN THE STATE WITH THE L. CFS. THT WOULD ALLOW US TO FIRST SOURCE THE MORE SUSTAINABLE MATERIALS. BUT THEN ALSO TO PUSH THE MINING INDUSTRY AND THE LARGE OEMS THE AUTO MANUFACTURERS. TO ALSO SOURCE THOSE MORE SUSTAINABLE MATERIALS. AND THAT'S AN OPPORTUNITY THAT BOTH FITS INTO OUR CODE IT FITS INTO THE RECYCLING LAWS WE ALREADY USE WHERE- LOOK OF CELL PHONES AND LAPTOPS PURCHASED IN CALIFORNIA HAVE A RECYCLING FEE BUILT IN. BUT WE COULD NOW DO THIS AROUND CARBON. AND SOCIAL JUSTICE AND WE KNOW THAT MANY OF THE MATERIALS IN THE DEVICES WE USE ALL THE TIME. COME FROM CONFLICT AREAS IN THE CONGO AND ELSEWHERE WHERE I WORK- BUT SOME. STANDARDS. THAT REQUIRE THESE TO BE. BETTER ON THE CLIMB HUMAN BASIS WOULD BE SOME THAT WOULD FIT WELL INTO CALIFORNIA'S- OVERALL PLAN SO THAT'S THAT'S THE THAT'S THE- START I WOULD. RECOMMEND ON THAT. THANK YOU. THE QUESTIONS. OKAY QUICK QUESTION IF YOU STILL ARE YOU OKAY WITH YEAH I KNOW COULD HURT- SO I MEAN I YOUR YOUR FEE BAIT IDEA I ACTUALLY I. WAS WORKING ON A CARBON FEE AND DIVIDEND- A PER PROPOSAL BUT- YOU KNOW BE A GIVEN THE- THE WARRANT IN UKRAINE AND IN THE SKYROCKETING GAS PRICES MEAN. DID YOU KNOW THAT AND SO THAT SEEMS TO BE THAT YOU KNOW OF THIS THEME THAT THAT I'M HEARING ON THIS CARDIO AND OTHERS HAVE RAISED I MEAN. WE HAVE THESE YOU KNOW THESE ASPIRATIONS TO TAKE BOLD ACTION TO ADVANCE CLIMATE AGENDA AND YET. YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE DEALING WITH THE REALITIES OF PEOPLE THAT. YOU KNOW- STILL DRIVING THEIR NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE TRUCK OR OR OR OR FOLKS THAT ARE. USING DIESEL TRACTORS I MEAN IT'S. AND ANY ANY THOUGHTS ON. YEAH I THINK IT'S ACTUALLY IT'S TIED INTO THE SAME AND I REALLY APPRECIATE BOTH THESE QUESTIONS I MEAN RIGHT NOW WITH THE HIGH PRICES DUE TO PRICE GOUGING AND RESTRICTED SUPPLY- DUE TO THE WAR IN UKRAINE. IT'S NOW FIFTY DOLLARS OR MORE TO DRIVE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILES IN AN S. U. V. WHERE IS AN ELECTRIC VEHICLE IT'S ON THE ORDER OF TEN DOLLARS. SO THERE IS A SOCIAL ECONOMIC INJUSTICE IN NOT INNOVATING MORE IN THESE AREAS. CALIFORNIA IS THE BIGGEST VEHICLE MARC IN THE COUNTRY. IS THE BIGGEST DRIVER IN DEMAND WHEN PRESIDENT BIDEN GOT INTO AN F. ONE FIFTY LIGHTNING A MIDDLE YEAR HIGH AND EXPENSIVE PICKUP TRUCK. HE WAS SENDING A VERY CRITICAL MESSAGE. AND THEN RECENT AGREEMENTS TO ALLOW POWERING OF HOMES. FROM ELECTRIC VEHICLES IS A START IN THE SO CALLED VEHICLE TO GRID SO THERE'S A LONG TERM STRATEGY THAT WILL BENEFIT ALL CALIFORNIANS NOT JUST THE MOST AFFLUENT. BUT IN THE SHORT TERM. WITH BRIGHT WITH GAS PRICES IN CALIFORNIA NOW CLIMBING TOWARD SIX DOLLARS A MORE GALLON. OUR STRATEGY IS GOING TO HAVE TO BE TIED INTO ADDITIONAL SHORT TERM SUPPLY NOT ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT IN LONG TERM OIL AND GAS. BUT IN WORKING WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO RELEASE MORE PETROLEUM FROM THE STURGE PETROLEUM RESERVE. AND TO FIND OPPORTUNITIES SO THAT IN THE MEDIUM TERM. WE CAN GET THE AUTO MANUFACTURERS TO FOCUS MORE ON THE VEHICLES THAT WE SEE AS CRITICAL AND AGAIN WE HEARD FROM SEVERAL WITNESSES CALIFORNIA'S CRITICAL- AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION IS ALSO A HUGE DEMAND. THAT'S NOT GOING TO FIX THE PROBLEM TOMORROW MORNING BUT WE ARE LIKELY TO SEE UNFORTUNATELY YOU MORE CRISES LIKE UKRAINE NOT LESS OVERTIME AS RESOURCES GET FOUGHT OVER IN DIFFERENT WAYS. AND SO THAT TRANSITION STRATEGY IS ONE THAT CAN IF WE CAN REVERSE THIS BIAS TOWARDS THE RICHEST FIRST WHICH IS REALLY WHAT CALIFORNIA'S CLIMATE LAWS ALL ABOUT. SB THIRTY TWO WOULD NOT HAVE PASSED WITHOUT STRONG SUPPORT. FROM THE RAMAGE ESTES COMMUNITY THAT'S WHAT WE NEED TO. FOR MMHM- IT ONE OF THE OTHER RECOMMENDATIONS IS TO ACCELERATE THE TIME LINES FOR OFFSHORE WIND- MR GARCIA RATE RAISE THIS POINT EARLIER WE ARE AT A CONFERENCE LAST WEEK- WHERE. YOU KNOW THEY THEY THEY TALKED ABOUT- YOU KNOW HOW IT THERE THERE THERE IS. LIKE AFTER WHEN COMPANIES WERE WERE SAYING THAT THEY'RE READY TO BOOK IT TO HAVE PROJECTS TO COME ONLINE AND YET IT TAKES LIKE LIKE UP TO TEN YEARS TO GET THE TRANSMISSION GRID- HOOK UP- AND HOW DO WE ACCELERATE THAT. SO THERE'S NO UNFORTUNATELY ESY ANSWER THIS ONE THE PACK WAVE. WAVE TEST SITE IN SOUTHERN OREGON IS AN EXAMPLE OF HAVING HOOK UPS IN PLACE. THE ONE OF THE REASONS WHY HUMBOLDT BAY WAS CHOSEN. AS ONE OF OUR TWO EARLY BLOCKS IS BECAUSE THE TRANSMISSION CAPACITY WHILE NOT FULLY BUILT WAS PLANNED FOR THE NUCLEAR IRONICALLY FOR THE NUCLEAR POWER PLANT IT WAS THAT WAS STOP DECADES AGO. SO THERE'S OPPORTUNITIES TO TIE THAT IN. ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENTS ARE CRITICAL BUT- ALMOST EVERYONE I TALKED WITH THERE ARE SOME EXCEPTIONS BELIEVES THAT. FROM OFF SHORE TO SHORE CONNECTIONS IS THE MOST EFFICIENT- NEW TRANSMISSION LINES TO PUT IN- ENVIRONMENT FISH ALL HAVE RIGHTS BUT OUR ABILITY TO WORK THE JUSTICE ANGLES AND YOU DO THE EIA IS. LARGELY BECAUSE CHINA AND EUROPE ARE SO FAR AHEAD OF US THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT GOALS LIKE FIFTY AND SIXTY GIGAWATTS. WHEREAS WE HAVE ZERO IN PLACE RIGHT NOW SO THE OPPORTUNITY TO CATCH UP. IS A FAIRLY BORING ONE IN THE SENSE THAT WE WON'T CATCH UP BY DOING STUDY AFTER STUDY WE NEED HARDWARE IN THE WATER. BECAUSE THE ONLY WAY YOU LEARN WHAT WORKS BEST FOR COMMUNITIES THE ONLY WAY YOU BRING IN THE JOBS COMPONENTS IS TO GET SOME INITIAL OFFSHORE TURBINES AND SO GETTING EVEN VERY SMALL OFFSHORE WIND FARMS. FIXED AND THEN THE HEART MORE DIFFICULT FLOATING ONES. IS THE BEST IT IS THE BEST ANALYTICS AND AGAIN IT BEATS ANY MODEL THAT I COULD BUILD OR ANYONE ELSE COULD BUILD BECAUSE WE SIMPLY NEED TO SEE THOSE IN THE GROUND TO LEARN. WHAT WORKS AND WHAT DOESN'T THANKFULLY WE HAVE A GREAT RESOURCE. IT DID IF I HEARD YOU RIGHT AND SO WE ARE YOU SUGGESTING THE RIGHT CITING AS WELL AS WHAT SEEK WITH STREAMLINING I WOULD I WOULD YEAH I WOULD DO INITIAL LINES TO BOTH THE MORO BAY SITE AND THE HUMBOLDT BAY ARE QUITE GOOD INITIAL SITES. I WOULD START WITH SMALL PILOT PROJECTS A FEW TURBINES. AND THEN I WOULD BUILD OUT FROM THERE- AND AGAIN THE IDEA THAT WE COULD BE AT TEN GIGAWATTS OF OFFSHORE WIND BY THE END OF THIS DECADE AND I'VE SEEN ESTIMATES FROM DIFFERENT GROUPS MIGHT MY LABS MORE AGGRESSIVE OTHERS TALK ABOUT THREE GIGAWATTS. WE CAN GET TOWARDS THAT TEN WORSE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A QUARTER OR MORE OF CALIFORNIA'S ENERGY NOT JUST ELECTRICITY BUT GREEN HYDROGEN TO. BY THE END OF THIS DECADE COMING FROM SECTOR THAT DOES NOT EXIST TODAY. AND IT'S THE ONE THAT THE DEPART THE FEDERAL DEPARTMENT OF LABOR. LOOKS AT AS THE LARGEST POTENTIAL NEW JOB CREATING INDUSTRY OF ANY ENERGY SECTOR IN THE COUNTRY PERIOD FULL STOP NO FOOTNOTE. THAT'S A REAL OPPORTUNITY TO INVEST IN CALIFORNIA WORKERS. THANK YOU SEE NO YES- IS HOW DO THAN CENTER SKINNER THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND TRUST ME WHEN I SAY I WANT TO PERSONALLY ALSO REACH OUT TO YOU AND I KNOW YOU HAVE TO GO TO HEAR OTHER- APPOINTMENT I REALIZE THE TIME TO WE HAVE TO CATCH A FLIGHT TO GO BACK HOME I'M A BIG SUPPORTER OF ROOFTOP SOLAR I'M BUT MOST OF FROM LOS ANGELES. SO OUR WEATHER IS VERY DIFFERENT THAN THE REST OF THE STATE I'M ALSO A HUGE SUPPORTER OF THE GREEN NEW DEAL AND THE PILLARS OF THE GREEN NEW DEAL WHICH INCLUDE THE JUST TRANSITION OF WORKERS ENSURE ENSURING THAT YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT LEAVING PEOPLE BEHIND US WE TRY TO MOVE FORWARD WITH WHAT WITH OUR FUTURE LOOKS LIKE. IN A CONVERSATION THAT I HAD WITH A COLLEAGUE WHO LIVES BY THE REDWOODS THE CONVERSATION ON ROOFTOP SOLAR WAS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT TO SIMPLY BECAUSE SOME MIGHT DOESN'T GET TO THE ROOFTOP SOLAR AS MUCH AS YOU KNOW LOS ANGELES AND THAT REALLY MADE ME THINK ABOUT. WHAT WE OFTEN TALK ABOUT IS A DIVERSE RENEWABLE ENERGY PORTFOLIO SO WHAT DOES THAT LOOK LIKE AND WHAT ARE THE COSTS RELATED TO EACH OF THESE DIFFERENT TYPES OF METHODS HAVE YOU DONE OR DO YOU HAVE INFORMATION ON LIKE A COST COMPARISON ANALYSIS WHEN IT COMES TO WHAT THAT ACTUALLY LOOKS LIKE FOR- CARBON REDUCTIONS THROUGH ROOFTOP SOLAR VERSES OTHER YOU KNOW OTHER APPROACHES. SUCH A LONGER% CONVERSATION I'D FOLLOW UP AND FOLLOW UP WITH YOU AFTERWARDS BUT BOTH MY LABORATORY AND GREAT AND GREAT GREAT ALTERNATIVES USED TO BE CALLED BASE TO HEAR AND- IT BUT BASS NO CALIFORNIA AND TO THE SOCIAL JUSTICE ENERGY LAB AT UCLA RUN BY PROFESSOR STEPHANIE PINTLE. THOSE ARE ALL LOOKED AT THIS I USED TO LIVE IN AN APARTMENT IN NEWIN WEST HOLLYWOOD ON FAIRFAX AND WE HAD THESE VERY FOGGY LONG MORNINGS THAT'S WHERE THIS TRADE OFF BETWEEN SOME COLLECTIVE SOLAR SUCH AS THE ON THE SURFACE ON ON THE ROOF OF SAFEWAY OR RALPHS GROCERY STORES SHARED BY THE COMMUNITY IS AN EXCELLENT WAY TO MOVE AHEAD BECAUSE THOSE LARGER REYES. USED TO BE SIGNIFICANTLY CHEAPER BUT AS. THE PRICES DROP AND DROP FOR SOLAR. THE RALPH. SOLAR POWER IS REALLY NO LONGER THE RATE LIMITING COST STEP IT'S THE INTEGRATION IT'S THE WORK WITH UTILITY OR THE MUD DEPENDING WHERE ONE'S WORKING AND IT'S THERE WHERE THE LOCAL RESTRICTIONS REALLY MATTERS BUT IT'S ALSO THERE WHERE THE JOBS BENEFITS CAN BE THE HIGHEST BECAUSE ONE IRONY OF SMALL SCALE DISTRIBUTED ROOFTOP SOLAR IS THAT JUST MORE JOBS PER DOLLAR PER MEGAWATT SO YOU KIND OF GOT A BIT OF A BALANCE THERE AND I THINK THAT'S A PLACE WHERE. ALL OF THE ABOVE FOR SOLAR BUT ALSO FOR LOCALLY DEPLOYED STORAGE ENDS UP BEING A REAL WIN AT THE COMMUNITY LEVEL. SANDERS CAN. THANK YOU CHAIR I KNOW I'VE THANK YOU FIRST CAME IN FOR- COMING AND SHARING YOUR THOUGHTS- A COUPLE COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS- I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE YOUR- ELABORATION ON THE YOU KNOW THE WAY YOU FEEL MIGHT BE THE WEAKNESSES OF THE PC'S- PENDING DECISION AND I WONDERED IF YOU COULD TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THE ROLE YOU MENTIONED MICRO GRIDS. AND WHILE THE STATE HAS NOT YET AND I THINK IT'S UNFORTUNATE BUT WE HAVE NOT YET- OPENED UP FOR PLANNED FOR THAT ABILITY OF MY GROUP GRIDS TO HELP US ACHIEVE OUR- STABILITY ON THE GRID IN OUR RESILIENCY AND I OF COURSE ROOFTOP SOLAR WITH STORAGE AND THAT COULD BE ROOFTOP SOLAR ON COMMERCIAL PUBLIC FACILITIES AS WELL AS RESIDENTIAL FACILITIES COULD PLAY OR NOT ONLY COULD IS ESSENTIAL TO A TO A MARGARET- IN MY ONE OF MY OBJECTIONS TO THE PENDING DECISION WAS EXACTLY THE POINT THAT COULD PRECLUDE OUR ABILITY. WHICH I FEEL WE NEED TO EXPLORE NOT ONLY FOR GRID STABILITY BUT ALSO FOR- WE HAVE TO DO POWER OUTAGES AT TIMES WHETHER AS WILDFIRE OTHER REASONS AND ARE BECAUSE OF THE WAY THE GRID IS NOW YOU KNOW OUR DAD IS NOW DESIGN THEY HAVE TO BE IN LARGE AREAS VERSUS MORE TARGETED AND. A MICROGRID WOULD PRESERVE. I PLACE TO HAVE THEIR NEED POWER THAT OTHER THAT TURNED SO WOULDYOU MIND IF YOU BRIEFLY- ON THE BUT FINE MY OTHER. IS AROUND YOUR SENSE OF HOW HOW QUICKLY. GREEN HYDROGEN MIGHT BE ACTUALLY COMMERCIALLY VIABLE IN FOR AND I AND I AM WITHOUT PURCHASING GREEN HYDROGEN THE Y. FEEL THAT THERE ARE PROBABLY CERTAIN USES THAT WOULD BE FAR MORE. A BENEFICIAL TO US YOU KNOW LIKE FOR EXAMPLE IN HEAVY DUTY LONG LONG. PAUL VEHICLE- TRUCKS AND GOODS MOVEMENT HOWEVER. PART OF THE ISSUE IS YOU KNOW WHAT BOTH WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO HELP IT. COME TO BE COMMERCIALLY VIABLE AND THEN HOW SOON DO YOU THINK IT WOULD BE AND I'M TALKING GRIGNARD. YEAH WELL ACTUALLY THE ENERGY INNOVATION MODEL HAS A REALLY IMPORTANT SECTION ON LEADING OPPORTUNITIES FOR GREEN HYDROGEN. AGAIN THE MORE WE BUILD OUT OFFSHORE WIND THE MORE WE GET THAT UNGIBLE SUPPLIED BECAUSE THEY CAN SELL LIKE TRICITY WENT PRICES HIGH HYDROGEN WHEN THE PRICE OF ELECTRICITY IS LOW. BUT BUILDING OUT SOME INDUSTRIAL CLUSTERS IS THE MODEL THAT BOTH THE E. U. AND THE U. K. HAVE ADOPTED FIRST. LONG BEACH IS A NATURAL PLACE TO DO IT PORT OF OAKLAND IS A NATURAL PLACE TO DO IT SAN DIEGO TO DO BOTH INDUSTRY AND THE MILITARY ARE PLACES WHERE FIX DEMANDS REALLY HELP- IN THIS WILL TIE BACK TO THE GREEN CEMENT QUESTIONS AS WELL BECAUSE THEY WERE GOING TO BUILD INFRASTRUCTURE WE WANT TO DO THAT AND IS YOUR CARBON WAY. SO WE DO NOT HAVE THE CURRENT DEMAND FOR THAT HYDROGEN BUT THIS IS A CASE WHERE CALIFORNIA CAN REALLY CREATE THAT SO I THINK THERE'S A PLACE WHERE AGAIN THE TWO OTHER- PANELISTS. HAVE SOME VERY SPECIFIC POINTS FOR THOSE TO BE THE THREE HUBS THAT I WOULD RECOMMEND FOR REGIONAL AND THEY HAPPEN TO BE DISTRIBUTED ACROSS THE STATE WHICH IS CONVENIENT. SO WE WOULD BUILD OUT SOME GREEN HYDROGEN INFRASTRUCTURE AND REWARD USE. AND THE BEST WAY TO REWARD USE IS TO GO BACK TO THE SOCIAL COST OF CARBON. BECAUSE IF WE WERE UTILIZING A SOCIAL COST OF CARBON HEIGHT WHICH IS HIGHER THAN THE MARKET PRICE. WE WILL BE REWARDING THAT GREEN HYDROGEN EXACTLY IN THOSE IN THOSE CENTERS SO I AGREE I AGREE WITH YOU ON THAT ONE ON THE MICROGRID STORE I COULDN'T AGREE WITH YOU MORE AND IN FACT. THE GLOBAL PICTURE HAS MOVED ON SO MY DAY JOB RIGHT NOW IS NOT AT UC BERKELEY WHERE I'M PROFESSOR BUT I'M THE ENERGY ADVISER FOR U. S. AGENCY FOR NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT THE BY THE MINISTRATION. WE ARE NOW SEEING SO CALLED METRO GRIDS MEGA. MAKER GRADES BEING BUILT AROUND THE WORLD. FROM RURAL COMMUNITIES IN AFRICA TO COMMUNITIES IN EUROPE- IN SOUTHEAST ASIA. THE ABILITY TO BUILD MUCH LARGER MICRO GRIDS NOW. PROVIDES MANY MORE PEOPLE LIGHT INDUSTRY BUSINESS WITH. CLEAN RELIABLE POWER. AND IF WE REWARD. THE UTILITIES THE I'LL USE. FOR TYING THOSE IN AS OPPOSED TO PUNISHING THEM WHICH HAS BEEN THEIR PERCEPTION ON HOW WE PUSH THIS PRODUCT. THIS PROCESS FORWARD. I ACTUALLY THINK THERE'S A PATHWAY IN FRONT OF THE P. U. C. TO ENABLE. MANY GRIDS I'M A CALL THE NEWS METRO GRIDS BUT TO DO SO IN A WAY THAT REALLY BENEFITS. LOWER INCOME COMMUNITIES NOT JUST TO AIR QUALITY. BUT THROUGH JOBS AND THROUGH THE REBUILD A VERY AS WE MOST NEED TO DO IT AND AGAIN THOSE PORT HUBS RUBY WOULD BE MY RECOMMENDED STARTING POINTS. SO I JUST I REALLY WANT TO THANK EVERYONE I AM NOW PROBABLY AT A POINT WHEN I MET A GIRL IN MY CAR AND THEY GET ON MY- TESTIMONY BUT I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL I. LOOK FORWARD TO FOLLOWING UP AND I'LL JUST LEAVE SOME BUSINESS CARDS IF ANYBODY WANTS TO. RESOLVE MY THANKS THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK THANK A DOCTOR THEM. ALL RIGHT- THANK YOU SO MUCH TO THE OTHER PANELISTS. THAT HAVE BEEN PATIENTLY WAITING TO. ANY ANY. THE QUESTIONS FOR OUR THE PANELISTS CENTER SKINNER. YES I WANTED TO ASK A QUICK QUESTION I HAVE TO LEAVE MYSELF FALL TO SPREAD ON TWO MISTER. REGARDING THE- ROSS. EMISSIONS SOME- WE- MY COLLEAGUE SENATOR BECKER ALREADY- HAD A SUCCESSFUL LOTS A SUCCESSFUL BILL THAT'S NOW SIGNED INTO LAW IN EFFECT THAT WOULD BRING DOWN THE- ENERGY INPUT- EMISSIONS RELATED TO CEMENT AND CALLS FOR CEMENT OVER ALL PRODUCTION IN CALIFORNIA. TOO GPO KEEPING GIVE THE EXACT GOAL BUT BUT IN BEING ABLE TO ACHIEVE THAT THE CEMENT INDUSTRY WILL HAVE TO DEAL WITH ITS PROCESS EMISSIONS SO I HAVE A BILL THAT I'VE INTRODUCED THIS YEAR TO ALLOW FOR SOME PILOT PROJECTS TO- CAPTURE THE PROCESS EMISSIONS AND STORE THEM GEOLOGICALLY. AND I WONDERED IF YOU WANTED TO COMMENT EITHER ON THE SWITCHERS SETS THE FEASIBILITY OF THAT GEOLOGIC STORAGE WORK THERE'S ANOTHER IF THERE'S SOME OTHER THING THAT WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT. IN ORDER TO DEAL WITH THE PROCESS EMISSIONS FROM CEMENT. YEAH SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE QUESTION AND I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO THANK BOTH YOU AND SENATOR RECORD FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE. IT'S REALLY INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT- AS YOU CORRECTLY POINT OUT- THE REASON WHY- THE CEMENT INDUSTRY IS IN MY OPINION THAT THE CORRECT PLACE TO START. WITH ANY ACTIVITY AROUND CARBON CAPTURE AND STORAGE IS BECAUSE OF THOSE PROCESS EMISSIONS. THERE ARE IDEAS OUT THERE FOR HOW WE CAN. ROUTE ELIMINATE THOSE PROCESS EMISSIONS BY WITHOUT THE USE OF CARBON CAPTURE AND STORAGE BUT FRANKLY. I WOULD CHARACTERIZE THEM AS AT THE LABORATORY STATE LABORATORY STATE SOME OF THEM ARE ONLY AVAILABLE AT VERY SMALL SCALES SO THEY COULD NOT MEET IN A BALK WAY OUR NEED FOR. CEMENT AND CONCRETE. SO I THINK THAT THAT IS A VERY REASONABLE APPROACH. I ALSO THINK THAT IT SHOULD BE COUPLED WITH THINGS THAT- DO NOT REQUIRE THE SAME LEVEL OF A NEW TECHNOLOGY AND CAPITAL INVESTMENT LIKE US CHANGING. CODES AND STANDARDS AND SPECIFICATIONS THROUGH CALTRANS TO INCENTIVIZE THE USE OF LOS AMEND CONCRETES AND LOW CLINKER CEMENTS. BOTH OF WHICH CAN REDUCE GREENHOUSE THE GREENHOUSE GAS INTENSITY OF CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS IMMEDIATELY AND WITHOUT MUCH TECH WITHOUT ANY TECHNOLOGICAL RISK IN MANY CASES AND OFTEN AT A COST SAVINGS. WE WANT TO TAKE IN ALL OF THE ABOVE APPROACH BUT CERTAINLY THIS IS THE RIGHT PLACE TO START WITH- OFF ANY ACTIVITY AND CARBON CAPTURE AND STORAGE. THANK YOU AND- I DIDN'T TEND TO DO THAT AT ONE POINT FIVE. TO BE HONEST- UNFORTUNATELY EVEN REMEMBER WHAT THE DISPOSITION WHETHER IT NEVER GOT ANYWHERE WHETHER ALTRANS TWO THOUSAND IMPLEMENTED BUT IT IS A VERY. THAT ISSUE IS VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE YEAHWE ARE THE LARGEST USERS OF THE CEMENT AND IF WE DON'T. IF WE THE STATE OR NOT. DRIVING THE STANDARDS FOR THE AGGREGATE TO BE ABSENT OF SUCH. BE RECYCLED CONTENT OTHERS THE AGGREGATE TO BE SUCH THAT IT IS. PARDON LOWER CARBON THERE WERE BEING PRETTY. YES THE REALLY IS. FINANCE WHO WAS A THANK YOU THAT BILL THIS YEAR ON THE- WE PUT A BY CLEAN. YEAH THANK YOU THAT THAT'S GREAT. HAVE A QUESTION I'M SURE I'LL JUST FIRST WELL THANK YOU THE OTHER PRESENTATIONS WERE EXCELLENT- YES THINK HIGHLY CEMENTED CENTER SKINNER SAID WE'RE VERY FOCUSED ON IT AND- I THINK IF WE CAN AUGMENT THAT WE ARE WITH THOSE THAT THE BILL WE PASSED THE FIRST BILL- AND ACTUALLY FIRST REALLY BIG CALIFORNIA AND CENTER MARKET ASSEMBLY MEMBER MURATSUCHI PRESENTED IN THE- ASSEMBLY THAT- THAT. FIRST ACCIDENT AS YOUR TARGET FOR ANY SEGMENT OF THE CALIFORNIA ECONOMY SO WE DO NOT HAVE A NET ZERO TARGET ACTUALLY BUILT IN- A BORDER CARBON. ESCENARIO NO CAR HAS TO IMPLEMENT THAT- BUT THAT WE ACTUALLY PROTECT CALIFORNIA'S YOUR SUPPORT PART OF WHAT YOU WERE SAYING TO WRITE IS TO WE WANT OF COURSE NOT TO DRIVE THESE DROPS COMPLETELY OUT OF STATE. IT'S TO ACTUALLY MAKE CHANGES THAT AFFECT THE GLOBAL MARKETS ALTERNATELY- I YOU KNOW SO FOR- DR BUSH'S THINK OF OVER LIKE TO. HAVE THAT. WHICH A COUPLE QUICK QUESTIONS TO SET THAT- WE HAVE TO MORE THAN- FAR PROGRESS TO ME OUR GOALS IS THAT WE- THAT'S CORRECT BASED ON- COMPARED TO THE FIVE YEAR TRENDS WHICH WORKS OUT TO I THINK FOUR POINT SEVEN MILLION METRIC TONS PER YEAR- OF COURSE IT WILL CALL AT FIVE AND THEN IF I'M REMEMBERING THE SLIDE CORRECTLY. A STRAIGHT LINE PATH TO. TWO TWENTY THIRTY WHAT WOULD REQUIRE AN AVERAGE REDUCTION OF SIXTEEN MM CHIEF PER YEAR ARE MILLION METRIC TONS. YES THEY SHOULD GIVE US ALL PAUSE YOUR CHANGES TO HIT OUR OWN CURRENT GOAL IS NOT ONLY TO. HAVE ADDITIONAL- AMBITION WE'VE HAD OUR OWN GOALS HAVE TO TRIPLE OUR PROGRESS JUST TO HAVE HER OWN GOALS THAT'S RIGHT. YEAH YEAH I THINK THAT'S JUST REALLY OPTIONS ARE COLLEAGUES REALLY APPRECIATE THAT- AND I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE GET THAT MESSAGE OUT THE MEASURE GOVERNOR ACTUALLY CREATES IT PROBABLY- YEAH AND AGAIN WE HAVE THIS OPPORTUNITY SURPLUS WE HAVE TO DO THAT APPRECIATE YOUR OTHER. EXAMPLES OF THE AT THE VERY TAX WE DON'T EIGHTY NINE PERCENT. AND YOUR CA NINETY THOUSAND MOTOR VEHICLE JOBS A LOT OF BEEN CREATED- INSTANCE THE PRE EVEY ERROR IS THAT CORRECT. NOT KNOWING FRACTURING- COMPARED TO THE SO THE NEW ME THE GM TOYOTA PLANT AND- IN THAT USED TO BE A FREE MY CLOTHES DOWN IN TWENTY TEN. AND IF YOU LOOK AT. THE MUGGED ON OCT MANUFACTURING JOBS BEFORE THEN THEY WERE NEVER MORE THAN NINE THOUSAND AND SO NOW WE'RE OVER NINETEEN THOUSAND SO WE'RE WE'RE DOUBLE THE- HE AB THIRTY TWO LEVEL IF YOU WORK WELL OR OR- DOUBLE THE LEVEL BEFORE EVEY MANUFACTURING- STARTED IN CALIFORNIA. MMHM JEFF AND THAT'S BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS DATA AND I'M HAPPY TO SHARE THE- LOOK THE CODE IT CETERA. WELL THAT'S IT YEAH GET APPRECIATE THAT THIS IS A GREAT STEP THAT WE SHOULD BE USING AND THE- THE POLICY SIMULATOR I SHOULD LOOK FOR TO. INTERESTS AND HER COLLEAGUES AS WELL. THAT'S WHAT YOU SAY ON THE FREE ALLOCATIONS- THAT THIS IS A HUGE ISSUE WITH UNDERMINING OUR CAPTURE MARKET CAN YOU SPEAK MORE ABOUT THAT. YES WELL ALSO THE SURPLUS SUPPLY OF ALLOWANCES THAT HAVE BEEN BANK BUT- ONE OF THE REASONS THE EUROPEAN UNION IS MOVING TOWARDS THE BORDER CARBON ADJUSTMENT MECHANISM MECHANISM IS THEY'VE REALIZED THAT. ANY FREE ALLOCATION- OVER THE LONG RUN HAS SOME CONNECTION TO- TURNS OUT TO BE A SUBSIDY FOR EXISTING PRODUCTION AND SO IT IT IT ENDS UP. UNDERMINING THE PRICE SIGNAL IF THERE'S ANY FREE ALLOCATION AND- SO THAT- YOU KNOW. I THINK THERE'S INCREASING RECOGNITION THAT THE CARBON PRICES BEST A SWEEPING UP US. A SHORT RUN LOW COST SUPPLY PRODUCTIONS AND NOT NECESSARILY INCENTIVIZING THE INVESTMENTS. WE NEED MADE. SO ANY ADVICE FOR US IN IN OUR CARBON MARKETS. WELL I GUESS GIVEN- YOU KNOW AFFORDABILITY CONCERNS IN THE INEVITABILITY. OF COST PASSED THROUGH IT AND YOU CAN DEAL WITH THAT BY USING THE OPTION REVENUE UP I'M MORE INCLINED TO POINT OUT SOME OF THE DIRECT SECTOR STANDARDS WHICH ARE ACTUALLY CAN HAVE MARKET MECHANISM LIKE- ATTRIBUTES I THINK CALIFORNIA IS BLOWN APART THE AYE THE SORT OF FALSE BINARY. COMMANDED CONTROL VERSES MARKETS. THE DICHOTOMY IF YOU WILL SO YOU KNOW IN THE LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD WE HAVE A TRADING MECHANISM WITH MANY OF OUR- MANY OF OUR- OUR SECTOR POLICIES HAVE UP. FLEXIBILITY THAT ALLOWS A LEAST COST OF SOLUTIONS SO- I THINK YOU KNOW THE OF INDUSTRIAL. STANDARD FOR HEAT OF SUMMER DEAR COOK- CEMENT POLICY. IS THE DIRECTION I'D BE MORE INCLINED TO GO OTHERWISE- YOU KNOW IT'S ADJUSTMENTS EITHER ADJUSTMENTS TO THE SUPPLIER ALLOWANCES TO CORRECT FOR THE BANK ALLOWANCES AS THEY'VE THEY'VE BEEN DOING IN THE- OF THE E. U. WITH THEIR MARKET STABILITY RESERVE IS A CORRECTION FOR EARLY OVER SUPPLY AND ALSO IN THE- RED YOU PROGRAM IN THE NORTHEAST THE REGIONAL GREENHOUSE GAS INITIATIVE THEY- ESSENTIALLY DID A CORRECTION TO ACCOUNT FOR THE AMOUNT OF THE BANK IN THE INITIAL. FACE SO EITHER THAT OR OR SOME SORT OF ADJUSTMENT TO THE PRICE COLLAR. MISLI I SUGGESTED PERHAPS LINKING THE FLOOR TO WHETHER OR NOT WE'RE ON TRACK WITH OUR OVERALL GOAL GOAL SO IF WE'RE ON TRACK WE DON'T HAVE TO HAVE A CARBON PRICE GO UP MORE QUICKLY BUT IF WE'RE NOT ON TRACK AND WE WANT TO RELY ON THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM AS A BACKSTOP AS- CURRENT STRATEGY DOES THAT IT SHOULD BE MORE DIRECTLY LINKED. TO WHETHER OR NOT WE'RE ON TRACK OVERALL. RIGHT WELL THANK YOU YEAH I THAT AND AS YOU SAY BOTH THE READY MARKET IN THE EUROPEAN MARKET THAT HAD DONE COURSE CORRECTIONS. TO ADDRESS THIS OVERSUPPLY ISSUE THAT WE ALSO HAVE- THANK YOU FOR THAT AND LASTLY JUST. APPRECIATE THIS BECAUSE TALK ABOUT TRANSMISSION AND MY COLLEAGUES FOR BRINGING THAT UP I. I DO BELIEVE IT'S ACTUALLY IMPERATIVE THAT WE- MAKE PROGRESS ON TRANSMISSION THIS YEAR. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH- ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. I DON'T KNOW IF OF. DR A MAY FEEL THIS IS STILL ONLINE. YES I'M STILL HERE YES THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE. WE REALLY APPRECIATE TO SO- MAYBE IF WE CAN. GO BACK TO. THE. THE NATIONAL PICTURE THAT THAT YOU HAD TO. PRESENTED WITH YOUR YOUR REPORT- CAN YOU TALK ABOUT THE- YOU KNOW WE WE'VE WE'VE HEARD A LOT OF CALLS IN AND CALIFORNIA WEEK YOU KNOW IN CALIFORNIA WE LIKE TO THINK OURSELVES IS AS LEADING AND THE FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE BUT YOU KNOW WE ARE SHARING THESE REMINDERS THAT WE MAY NOT BE ON TRACK WITH THE THESE THESE GOALS THAT WITH THEIR THAT WE'VE SET FOR OURSELVES. MMHM WHAT. WHAT ARE THE OPPORTUNITIES AND TRADE OFFS OF PLANNING PLANNING FOR CARBON NEUTRALITY BY TWENTY THIRTY FIVE VERSUS TWENTY FORTY FIVE. SO I SHOULD BE CLEAR THAT WE MODEL THE- TO US BUT NET ZERO BY TWENTY FIFTY AND THAT WAS US WIDE RIGHT SO THERE'S ALSO KIND OF. WITHIN THAT FRAMEWORK FLEXIBILITY OF WHERE THINGS ARE CITED SO TO ME THAT TARGETS NOT JUST CALIFORNIA ALONE IT'S- YOU COULD PREFERENTIALLY SITE THINGS WHERE THERE MIGHT BE ON- FEDERAL RESOURCES OR LOWER CONSTRAINTS WITH RESPECT TO TRANSMISSION ARE OR OR OTHERWISE. IT WITH RESPECT TO THOUGH. THOUGH BUILDING THE TARGET TO TWENTY THIRTY FIVE WHICH WE DID WE WERE NOT MODELING- BECAUSE WE'RE NOT MODELING STATE SPECIFIC POLICIES RATHER A FEDERAL POLICY. MANY OF THE SAME CONSTRAINTS ARISE AS THEY WOULD IN A TWENTY FIFTY EIGHT RIGHT SO TRANSMISSION RATE REMAINS A CONSTRAINT AS MANY OF. USTHAT ALREADY- AND THAT AGAIN IS A REGIONAL ISSUE NOT A CALIFORNIA ISSUE WE ALSO SAY WHEN WE'RE THINKING ABOUT SEQUENCING OF CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE IS ALSO IMPORTANT WHEN THINKING OF A NEAR TERM- BUT TARGET AND THAT IS NOT JUST RELATED TO TRANSMISSION AND RENEWABLES. THAT'S ALSO RELATED TO THINGS LIKE CARBON CAPTURE WHERE YOU NEED A CAR WITH. US YOU TO TRANSMISSION. BACKBONE TWO HUNDRED AND SUPPORT KIND OF RE POWERING THE FACILITIES OR CONVERSION OF FACILITIES WITH WITH CARBON CAPTURE AND ALSO SAY OTHER THINGS THAT HAVE TO OCCUR IN THAT SEQUENCE IS BUILDING UP APPROPRIATE MANUFACTURING CAPACITY TO SUPPORT KIND OF THE BUILD OUT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. OFFSHORE WIND IT'S NOT JUST FINDING KIND OF VIABLE SITES FOR OFFSHORE WIND OR HAVING- IT READILY GRADING CONNECTED IT'S ALSO HAVING THE MANUFACTURING CAPACITY TO- ASSEMBLE WENT URBAN. WHO ARE SHOWING A SPECIALLY OR WHEN AND LAN BASED WHEN MOST MANUFACTURING CURRENTLY- IN THE U. IN THE US MORE BROADLY IS DOMESTIC 80% OF OUR WIND TURBINES- THAT WE DEPLOY I'VE BEEN MANUFACTURING DOMESTICALLY JUST BECAUSE OF. THE THIS IS A LARGE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT YOU'RE BUILDING IT HAS TO BE PROXIMATE. TO WHERE YOU'RE DEPLOYING. SO THOSE ARE CRITICAL PIECES AT THE WELL THE FACT SIDE NOT APPLY ON AND IT'S SITUATION GIVEN THAT KIND OF LOS OF OUR PRODUCTS ARE ARE- IN. A THIS CHAIN AND MOST OF THE CREDIT MATERIALS IS WELL TARGET OR EVEN OF A TWENTY FIFTY TARGET WHICH- WE WANT THESE ARE CONSTRAINTS THERE'S CAN OF THE GREAT OF THESE ROUTE OF THE SO CHAIN AND- I THINK. INTEREST. I NOTED THAT- THAT IN YOUR REPORT NEED FOR. AUG AND CARBON CAPTURE AND STORAGE OF. DID YOU HAVE ANY THOUGHTS IN TERMS OF. HOW YOU KNOW TO WHAT EXTENT. THE TECHNOLOGY BASED CARBON CAPTURE AND STORAGE IS GOING TO BE NECESSARY FOR ANY PATHWAY TO GET INTO CARBON NEUTRALITY. AS MANY OTHERS HAVE ALREADY SAID THAT IT IS ONE OF THE TOOLS WITHIN IN THE TOOLBOX- BUT OF COURSE THAT COMES WITH AND WE HAVE AN OF IT THAT DEMONSTRATED TECHNOLOGY BUT THERE'S ALSO ON THAT SIDE OF REGULATION AND ENSURING- APPROPRIATE MEASUREMENT MONITORING VERIFICATION PROTOCOLS RELATED TO THIS INFRASTRUCTURE. I WOULD ALSO SAY THAT WHEN YOU'RE TALKING MOST OF CARBON CAPTURE IS RETIRING EXISTING FACILITIES AND WHERE THERE ALREADY EXISTS IN EQUITIES AND WHERE THOSE FACILITIES ARE CITED AND THE AIR POLLUTION AND OTHER IMPACTS. THAT ARE IN THE INCLUDING KIND OF HAZARDOUS WASTE- REMEDIATION FROM THOSE FACILITIES- THERE IS THE OPPORTUNITY TO REGARD THOSE FACILITIES TO REDUCE AIR QUALITY IMPACTS AND OTHER NEGATIVE IMPACTS WITHIN THOSE COMMUNITIES BUT IT DOESN'T KIND OF INSURANCE PREVENT. FOR OUR COMMUNITIES AND SO THAT'S ANOTHER CONSIDERATION AS WELL. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FOR ANY OF OUR- OTHER PANELISTS- WE JUST MAKE SURE I. COVERED EVERYTHING HERE. OKAY WELL THANK YO ALL TO ALL OF OUR PANELISTS- WE LOOK FORWARD TO STAYING IN TOUCH AND- YOU KNOW I JUST WANNA HIGHLIGHTED- YOU KNOW DOCTOR KAMAN YOU KNOW SUMMARIZING IN WRITING GO URGENT RECOMMENDATIONS I MEAN THAT THIS IS THE KIND OF STUFF IT'S A THAT'S VERY HELPFUL FOR ALL OF US IN IN IN IN IN THE LEGISLATURE AND SO. YOU KNOW WE HOPE THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO WORK WITH ALL OF YOU YOU KNOW IN TERMS OF LIKE SPECIFIC POLICY PROPOSALS THAT THE THAT THE- THAT WE CAN DO TO ACCELERATE OUR OUR CLIMATE ACTION WE WOULD VERY VERY MUCH APPRECIATED ALSO THANK YOU TO EACH AND EVERYONE OF OUR- OUR OUR SPEAKERS TODAY. WE'RE GOING TO. NOW OPEN IT UP FOR PUBLIC COMMENT- I DON'T KNOW UP WE'LL START WITH THE TWO IN THE ROOM AND THEN- WE WILL OPEN UP OUR PHONE NUMBER FOUR FOR A- PARTICIPATING BY PHONE THE TOLL FREE NUMBER AGAIN IS. IS. ONE THREE ONE FIVE FOUR TWO ZERO TWO. AGAIN ONE THREE ONE FIVE FOUR TWO ZERO TWO- I'D LIKE TO IN THE INTEREST OF TIMEWE- ASK EACH. PUBLIC COMMENT TO BE LIMITED TO ONE MINUTE. SIR THE FLOOR IS YOURS. THANK YOU YEAH ADAM SMITH SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON EDISON SUPPORTS NEWSOM'S CARBON NEUTRALITY EXECUTIVE ORDER AND WE'D SUPPORT SEEING THAT ENSHRINED IN LAW. ABOUT AS YOU KNOW WE'RE GOING TO THE PRESENTATIONS TODAY AND EVEN FROM OUR OWN WORK IT'S PRETTY CLEAR THAT THE ELECTRIC SECTOR AND EDISON AS AN ALL ELECTRIC UTILITY WE REALIZE THERE'S A LOT OF WORK THAT THE ELECTRIC SYSTEM IS GOING TO NEED TO DO. TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN ACHIEVE CARBON NEUTRALITY BY TWENTY FORTY FIVE AND SO WE ENCOURAGE THIS COMMITTEE AND OTHER COMMITTEES THIS YEAR AS YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT YOU KNOW INCREASING AMBITION OR THINGS THE ELECTRIC SECTOR THINGS THE STATE CAN DO TO ENSURE WE'RE ON THE RIGHT TRACK. LET'S TAKE ANOTHER HARD LOOK AT HOW FORECASTING ELECTRIC SYSTEM PLANNING AND ALL THAT'S COMING TOGETHER BECAUSE IF WE'RE GOING TO HAVE HUGE LEVELS OF ADOPTION OF ELECTRIC VEHICLES SIGNIFICANT BUILDING ELECTRIFICATION YOU KNOW OUR LOTUS COULD DRAMATICALLY INCREASE WE NEED MORE TRANSMISSION WE'RE GONNA NEED TO START PLANNING AND START BUILDING. NOW TO ENSURE THAT WE'RE MEETING THE NEEDS OF THE FUTURE SO MAYBE WITH THAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR TIME TO THE- THAT'S BECAUSE THIS. RIGHT MCGILL'S GARLAND WITH WALKER GROUP YOU HAVE TO CALIFORNIA HEALTH ENVIRONMENT BOUNCE BUSINESS. TO WITH REGARDS TO DISCUSSIONS AROUND CARBON NEUTRALITY- I THINK WE HEARD TODAY THAT INDIVIDUAL GOALS AND AMBITION ALSO REQUIRED ADDITIONAL ABILITIES TO BUILD. WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT IN THIS CONVERSATION THAT WE PROVIDE THE TOOLS NECESSARY TO ACHIEVE THE ULTIMATE GOAL. WHICH MEANS WE NEED A PERMIT FASTER AND BUILD FASTER THAN WE EVER HAVE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND THAT'S INTEGRAL TO THIS DISCUSSION AND DEBATE AROUND WHAT THOSE TARGETS AND WHAT THOSE GOALS MAY BE. GOING FOR THIS INCLUDES DISTRIBUTION AND TRANSMISSION OF CLEAN MALL KILLS AND ELECTRONS- TO DISTRIBUTE IT AND USES. THROUGHOUT THE STATE WE MAY NOT KNOW IT DOESN'T USES ARE TODAY BUT IS FAIRLY LOW GREG AT STRATEGY TO. UPGRADE THE SYSTEM TO DELIVER MOLECULES AND ELECTRONS THAT ARE CLEAN AND RENEWABLE TODAY. AND THEN WITH YOUR INDULGENCE REAL QUICK I'LL PUT ON A DIFFERENT HAT WITH CALIFORNIA HYDROGEN COLLISION AND TO ASSEMBLY WOMAN KRIOS. COMMENTS ABOUT WHAT DO WE DO ABOUT LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES THAT MAY NOT HAVE ELECTRICAL INFRASTRUCTURE OR THE ABILITY PARKING GARAGES IN CHARGE. HYDROGEN PROVIDES A GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR THOSE FOLKS. TO HAVE COST EFFECTIVE VEHICLES THE TOP TWO MANUFACTURERS OF AUTOMOBILE SALES IN STATE CALIFORNIA BOTH ALL IN ON HYDROGEN ELECTRICVEHICLES. AND WE WANT TO DELIVER CLEAN MALL KILLS TO THE FOLKS WHO MAY NOT BE ABLE TO BE SERVED BY THE IN HOME CHARGING SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ALL RIGHT TO. OPERATOR. TO WE HAVE- ANY CALLS IN THE QUEUE. YOU FOR ANY PUBLIC COMMENTS MAY PRESS ONE AND THEN ZERO. AND WE WILL GO TO FIRST LINE LINE TWENTY YOUR LINE IS OPEN. HELLO TO THE STATE OF NEW YORK LEADERSHIP COUNCIL PROJECT CONTABILIDADE. I DON'T THINK THE MEMBERS AND PANELISTS TYPICALLY NEED TO FUNDAMENTALLY SHIFT ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES AND NOT JUST GRABBED THE POLLUTING FUELS WE LIVE. WITHIN OUR ECONOMY TODAY FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF WORLD AND THEN BACK IN THE CALIFORNIA AND ESPECIALLY THOSE IN THE PANEL CAN VALLEY SCALING ARE INVESTING INTO CVS IS NOT A VIABLE SOLUTION. WE CANNOT IGNORE THAT CD I REALIZED UNVARYING CLEARLY UNDESIRABLE TOXIC MATERIAL UNDERGROUND YEAH RESIDENTIAL COMMUNITIES. SURROUNDED BY DIFFERENT QUESTION POLLUTION AND WITH AND WITH UNJUSTLY BLASTER POLITICAL. POWER I. YOU PRETTY. OF THE KIND OF MEDICARE BELIEVE TO MENTAL RELY COMPANY WELL X. NOT OF THE INDUSTRY'S CARE ACT. THE MANAGED. AND CON THIRTY FIFTY YEARS I AT THE ON THIRTY. IS NOT A SIX. IN AVOIDANCE THE NECKLACE. NAMIK CHIU ME THAT THE STATE CAN SHE- TO INVEST KERR NOW. BUILDING ELECTRIC MICHAEL GRANT ROWAN AND AQUATIC COMMITTING THE- INVESTING IN THAT TRUNK WITH THE- INVESTING THE PAST OF LOCAL COMEDIAN. IT WITH THE WHAT FUTURE THE MIDDLE ECONOMY LOOK LIKE. WE MUST ALSO BE CLEAR THAT THE TECHNOLOGY IS NOT ACTUALLY POLICE AND WARMING GAS. THE CRIME AND WANTED ABOUT THE LARGER. CRY. THE SEATTLE NOT HELPING GROW GOING. WELL FOR HOW DO YOU CAPTURE DOCTOR UNTIL IT'S ACTUALLY IN THE CAPITAL I DON'T WISH DECADE FROM NOW WE NEED TO FOCUS ON DEVELOPING EQUITABLE COMMUNITY POLICY. MAKERS JUST TRANSITION A REALITY AS OPEN TODAY JERRY FEDERAL AND CORPORATE PRESIDENT ACT OF THE BENEFITS OF THE ECONOMY AT THE SAME TIME AS EVERYONE ELSE. THANK YOU THANK YOU I. FORGOT TO STATE EARLIER THAT- THIS COMMITTEE THIS JOINT COMMITTEE WILL BE. CONDUCTING. OUR OUR NEXT HEARING. I OUR WAY IF HERE ON ON K. AND THE FOLKS ON CAR CAPTURE AND STORAGE AND WE WILL MAKE SURE THAT. THAT ALL STAKEHOLDERS- IN OUR REPRESENTED AND THAT HEARING- OPERATOR NEXT TO. CALL THE POLICE. GET A COME FROM MY TWENTY TWO YEAR LINE IS OPEN. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS BEN GRANTED I'M PROVIDING COMING ON BEHALF OF ENVIRONMENT CALIFORNIA I'M ENVIRONMENT CALIFORNIA SUPPORT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED INVESTMENT IN ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES DECARBONIZATION EFFORTS. AND CLEAN ENERGY ESPECIALLY INVESTMENT IN OFFSHORE WIND INFRASTRUCTURE UPGRADES AND POLISH STORAGE THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE MUST ACCELERATE THE CONDITION AWAY FROM PUBLIC YOU'LL- AN ENVIRONMENT CALIFORNIA SUPPORT DAN CAME AND CALLED FOR AN ACCELERATED 1100% EVEY TIME LINE TO TWENTY THIRTY YEAR EARLIER. AGGRESSIVE MOVEMENT FOR IT ON OFFSHORE WIND AND A CONTINUED PROTECTION OF CALIFORNIA'S ROOFTOP SOLAR INDUSTRY. EMITTING A COLOR TAX MAKING GROUP SOLAR EXPENSIVE IS NOT THE PATHWAY TO ENSURING THE PAUL. ADDITIONALLY LEFT IN OUR HELPING INVESTMENT AND THAT INTRODUCTION- WILL SLOW DOWN OR SPEED CONDITION THEIR MISSION TRANSPORTATION. CALIFORNIA THE WORST AIR QUALITY OF ANY STATE IN THE COUNTRY IN OUR TRANSPORTATION SECTOR. FOR OVER TOPIC TAILPIPE EMISSIONS OF WELL. AND AT BOTH CONTENT THE IN A COLD BUFFET CALIFORNIA THE CALIFORNIA LET'S. NOT TAKE FULL ADVANTAGE. STOLAR IN OFFSHORE WIND NOW. THANK YOU THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND OUR NEXT QUESTION WILL COME FROM ONE NINE NINE YOUR LINE IS OPEN PLEASE GO AHEAD. AFTERNOON THAT THE BILL IS ON TRACK FROM THE CALIFORNIA LEAGUE OF CONSERVATION VOTERS NOW CALL CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL VOTERS. AND I WANT TO THANK THIS COMMITTEE FOR PRIORITIZING THIS ISSUE IN THIS DISCUSSION. AND WANTED TO URGE. THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER THAT AS WE DEPLOY SOLUTION TO CUT OUR EMISSIONS WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT FOR REDUCING OUR RELIANCE ON FOSSIL FUELS AND THE POLLUTION THAT THAT IMPOSES. ON THE COMMUNITIES WHERE IT FRIDAY SO IT'S IMPERATIVE THAT WE'RE GONNA CENTER EQUITY WHEN IT DRAFTING THE CLIMATE CRISIS THAT WE ARE PRIORITIZING POLICIES AND INVESTMENTS. THAT REDUCE EMISSIONS IN THE NEAR TERM AND ENSURE WOULD REDUCING POLLUTION BUT ECONOMY RESIDENTS ACROSS THE STATE. AND I WANT TO START THAT WHEN IT COMES TO CARBON CAPTURE AND STORAGE IT SHOULD BE STATED IN MANY CASES BUT NATURAL AND WORKING LANDS CARBON SEQUESTRATION IF TECHNICALLY MUCH CHEAPER TO IMPLEMENT. AND DIRECT AIR CAPTURE AND HOW THE MULTITUDE OF COKE BENEFITS NOT PROVIDED BY OTHER TECHNOLOGY NOT THE LEAST OF WHICH IS INTRODUCTION OF POLLUTION AND ENHANCEMENT OF AIR QUALITY THROUGHOUT THE STATE. THE COUNCIL STATED I THINK WE HAVE SOLUTIONS THAT COULD CREATE HIGH QUALITY JOBS THROUGHOUT THE STATE BY FOCUSING OUR INVESTMENTS IN RENEWABLE ENERGY PRODUCTION AND STORAGE BUT I WANT TO ADVOCATE FOR PRIORITIZING PUBLIC DOLLARS. AND RESOURCES THAN THOSE PROVEN SOLUTION EVEN IF IT MAY BE MORE EXPENSIVE AS- EXPENSIVE AS LONG AS IT REDUCES OUR DEPENDENCE ON FOSSIL FUEL AND PROTECT OUR COMMUNITIES FROM POLLUTION. THANK YOU THANK YOU. THANK NEXT WILL GO LINE. LINE IS OPEN. HI MY NAME IS DAN MAY MUSTAPHA TWENTY FOR THIS ANDREAS POVERTY IN ENVIRONMENT COURSE P. ON HIS BEHALF AND SPEAK TODAY. IN SHORT IN NORTH AMERICA HEAVILY SUBSIDIZED DOWN A NUMBER OPENED NEWS THAT ARE RUNNING FAILED TO MEET THEIR PROMISED. THAT SUCH SPENDING ON PCS IS A BAD INVESTMENT IN DEPRIVED ACTUAL CRIMES SOLUTION TO NEEDED FUNDING FOR THE FOR COMMUNITIES LIVING NEAR EXISTING FOSSIL FUEL INFRASTRUCTURE NOT ONLY TO THE TECHNOLOGY PERPETUATE EXISTING HARMS. EXACERBATE THEM WITHOUT ACTUAL CLIMATE BENEFITS FURTHER PIPELINES LEAK SUFFOCATING COME BACKSIDE GAS INTO THE ATMOSPHERE AND INTO COMMUNITIES AND STORAGE IS COMPLETELY UNTESTED AND UNPROVEN OVER RELEVANT COUNTRIES LONG TIME LINES. EVEN WORSE THE SUPPOSED CRIME INTERVENTION IS OVERWHELMINGLY YEARS TO CUT CARBON DIOXIDE FOR ENHANCED OIL RECOVERY WHICH IS ITSELF INCREDIBLY HARMFUL FOR LOCAL COMMUNITIES. AND IT OUTWEIGHS WHATEVER DUBIOUS CLIMATE BENEFIT CCS MIGHT CLAIM TO PROVIDE. RESULTING IN FURTHER DOWNSTREAM EMISSIONS BY SOME ESTIMATES CAUSING CCS TO INCREASE NET CARBON EMISSIONS BY A FACTOR OF FIVE. IN OTHER WORDS CCS WAS DEVELOPED BY WILLING GAS COMPANIES TO TRICK POLICYMAKERS AND THE PUBLIC INTO FUNDING FOR THE CLIMATE HARM AND ENVIRONMENTAL INJUSTICE PURELY FOR THEIR OWN PROFIT. IF THE STATE INSIST ON MARCHING BLINDLY DOWN THE SOUTH POLE PASSED HERE P. AND MANY OF OUR ENVIRONMENT ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ALLIES WOULD LOVE TO BE AT THE TABLE TO DISCUSS WHAT WE CAN DO TO LIMIT HARM TO OUR COMMUNITIES. WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUE DISCUSSION ON. THIS TOPIC THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND I LITTLE TWENTY ONE YEAR IS OPEN. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. SHARE THANK YOU MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS GERRY HUGHES I AM OF THE AMERICAS PROGRAM COORDINATOR WITH THE INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION MARKETWATCH AND I'VE FOUND THAT I HEARING TO BE VERY INTERESTING THERE'S BEEN SOME REALLY INTERESTING DISCUSSION ABOUT MANY TOPICS BUT I'M VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE GRASS BEING FOR TECHNOLOGICAL FIXES IT'S COMING FROM THIS COMMITTEE IN TERMS OF PURSUING UNPROVEN HIGH RISK TYPE TECHNOLOGIES IN PARTICULAR THOSE OF CARBON DIOXIDE REMOVAL INTEREST IN SUCH HIGH RISK TECHNOLOGIES HAS GROWN IN MANY CIRCLES. AND EVEN MORE NOTABLY INCLUDING INDUSTRIES SUCH AS THE ALSO FUEL INDUSTRY MINING AVIATION AND AS WELL SILICON VALLEY HOWEVER THE LATEST IPCC REPORT CLIENTS THAT THESE TECHNOLOGIES COULD TRIGGER CATASTROPHIC EVENTS IF YOU CAN BELIEVE IN VULNERABLE PARTS OF THE WORLD THEY WOULD INTRODUCE A RANGE OF NEW GREGIS HAZARDS TO PEOPLE AND ECOSYSTEMS LARGE SCALE TECHNOLOGICAL CTR JEOPARDIZES PEOPLE SYSTEMS BIODIVERSITY FOOD AND WATER SECURITY LIVELIHOODS AND LAND RIGHT TO TAKE A LOOK FOR INDIGENOUS PEOPLE AND LOCAL COMMUNITIES. THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN SPECIAL REPORT FROM THE I. P. C. C. R. ONE POINT FIVE DEGREES CELSIUS CAUTIONED AGAINST HEAVY RELIANCE ON CD ARE STRONGLY QUESTIONING THE SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL FEASIBILITY I THOUGHT A LITTLE BIT DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS HEARING THAT THERE WAS NOT A MORE DIVERSITY OF VOICES ON THESE MATTERS AND THE LAST THING I WANT FLAG AS FAR AS DECARBONIZATION GOES HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS THAT THERE IS A VERY STRONG AND VERY POLITICALLY SUPPORTED PIVOTAL LIQUID BIOFUELS HAPPENING IN THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA. AND WE'VE BEEN CAUSING A LOT OF EVIDENCE ABOUT DEPENDENT ON HIGH DEFORESTATION RISK COMMODITIES LIKE SOY AS A FEEDSTOCK FOR LIQUID BIOFUELS IS NOT THE KIND OF SOLUTION SO I REALLY THINK THAT THIS COMMITTEE NEEDS TO TAKE A STEP BACK AND TAKE A LOOK A HARD LOOK AT THE MECHANISMS THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN IN PLACE BEFORE GOING FURTHER DOWN THE PATHWAYS ABOUT IMAGINARY. TECHNOLOGIES THANK YOU THANK YOU PUBLIC IF YOU THIS TIME. ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH TO ALL AND THIS NEW HEARING IS ADJOURNED.
