THE SPORADIC NATURE OF THESE

00:31:38.763 --> 00:31:40.131

THIS TROUBLING MISMANAGEMENT HAS

00:38:45.056 --> 00:38:46.957
STUCK WITH ME BECAUSE WE ARE

HEALTH AND LIVES AT STAKE.

00:39:09.413 --> 00:39:09.914
THERE NEEDS TO BE A HIGHER

00:39:09.980 --> 00:39:10.815
STANDARD.

WHERE PEOPLE'S LIVES ARE AT

00:42:15.799 --> 00:42:17.902
STAKE AND I THINK THAT'S WHY I

00:42:17.968 --> 00:42:19.637
DECIDED TO DO IT HERE AND IN THE

00:42:19.703 --> 00:42:20.471

00:42:25.142 --> 00:42:26.443

PERFORMANCE BASED BUDGETING BUT

00:43:41.352 --> 00:43:42.453
KIND OF SIMILAR IN THE SENSE

00:43:42.519 --> 00:43:44.054
THAT YOU TAKE A HOLISTIC LOOK AT

00:43:44.121 --> 00:43:45.155
WHAT THE DEPARTMENT HAS TO DO

00:43:45.222 --> 00:43:46.256

WHAT THEY'RE NOT DOING WELL

00:43:48.525 --> 00:43:49.727
WOULDN'T THAT SOLVE THE PROBLEM

00:43:49.793 --> 00:43:50.961

00:43:51.028 --> 00:43:54.665
