AND WHAT I'VE ASKED STAFF TO DO

00:01:22.816 --> 00:01:23.983
IS TO GIVE ME A LITTLE MORE

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:25.718
ANALYSIS BECAUSE WHEN WE WENT

00:01:26.786 --> 00:01:28.855
AND WE LOOKED AT THE U. PROBES

00:01:28.922 --> 00:01:32.659
ANALYSIS ON THE POTENTIAL COSTS

00:01:32.725 --> 00:01:33.626
FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF THESE

00:01:33.693 --> 00:01:34.427
BILLS.

00:01:34.494 --> 00:01:36.429
THERE WAS THE GREAT DEAL OF

00:01:36.496 --> 00:01:37.931
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN.

00:01:37.997 --> 00:01:40.800
THE ASSESSMENTS THAT WERE GIVEN

00:01:40.867 --> 00:01:42.202

BY OTHER OFFICES.

00:01:43.536 --> 00:01:44.771
VERSES WHAT'S PRESENTED TO US

00:01:44.838 --> 00:01:48.308
TODAY SO I WANTED -- TO HAVE

00:01:48.374 --> 00:01:51.945
STAFF DIG A LITTLE DEEPER ON AND

00:01:52.011 --> 00:01:54.647
FOR EXAMPLE IF WE TAKE THE ITEM

00:01:54.714 --> 00:01:59.853
ISSUE TO ON THE SEX OF BENT SEX.

00:01:59.919 --> 00:02:01.287

I'M.

00:02:02.021 --> 00:02:04.224
THAT BILL.

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.526
WOODS ULTIMATELY HOPEFULLY

00:02:06.593 --> 00:02:08.828
REDUCE THE WORKLOAD OF DOJ

00:02:08.895 --> 00:02:10.363
BECAUSE THE BILL.

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:13.099
CHANGES UP UNTIL THAT BILL WAS

00:02:13.166 --> 00:02:15.368
PASSED CALIFORNIA'S SEX REGISTRY

00:02:15.435 --> 00:02:16.769
WAS LIFETIME FOR EVERYBODY ONE

00:02:16.836 --> 00:02:17.971
SIZE FITS ALL.

00:02:18.037 --> 00:02:20.907
AND NOW BILL ADJUSTED IT SO THAT

00:02:20.974 --> 00:02:23.543
YOU HAD PEOPLE ON SOME PEOPLE IN

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:24.177

ON THE REGISTRY.

00:02:28.715 --> 00:02:31.451
AND WHEN THE BILL PASSED IN THAT

00:02:31.518 --> 00:02:33.152
VERY FISCAL YEAR.

00:02:33.219 --> 00:02:34.420
OR WAS IT LAST YEAR ALWAYS

00:02:34.487 --> 00:02:35.622
FORGET BUT WHATEVER.

00:02:35.688 --> 00:02:38.091
WE APPROVED TEN MILLION DOLLARS

00:02:38.157 --> 00:02:40.293
FOR DOJ AND SOME POSITIONS

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:41.628
BECAUSE WE KNEW THAT THERE WOULD

00:02:41.694 --> 00:02:42.328
BE.

00:02:42.395 --> 00:02:43.863
OBVIOUSLY YOU'D HAVE TO MAKE

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:49.369
ADJUSTMENTS TO BE ON SOFTWARE

00:02:49.435 --> 00:02:53.773
THAT THE COMPUTER I. T. I T. IN

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.074
ORDER.

00:02:55.141 --> 00:02:56.809
TO THE APPROPRIATELY

00:02:56.876 --> 00:02:58.511
ADMINISTERED THE CHANGE AND THAT

00:02:58.578 --> 00:03:01.247
THERE MAY BE SOME ON GOING F. T.

00:03:01.314 --> 00:03:02.582
E. ASSOCIATED.

00:03:02.649 --> 00:03:05.118
OUR BUT THE ITEM THAT'S ON THAT

00:03:05.184 --> 00:03:08.288
WOULD ONLY WOULD INCREASE ON TOP

00:03:08.354 --> 00:03:11.257
OF WHAT WE HAD ALREADY APPROVED

00:03:11.324 --> 00:03:12.659
THIRTY SEVEN NEW F. T. EAT.

00:03:12.725 --> 00:03:14.394
AND WHEN WE LOOKED AT THE NUMBER

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:15.728
OF SEX OFFENDERS WHICH IS

00:03:15.795 --> 00:03:20.600
APPROXIMATELY -- HUNDRED

00:03:20.667 --> 00:03:21.200
THOUSAND HUNDRED THOUSAND FIVE

00:03:21.267 --> 00:03:22.302
ENDERS NEW PEOPLE ADDED EVERY

00:03:22.368 --> 00:03:23.670
YEAR BUT NOW THERE WILL BE

00:03:23.736 --> 00:03:25.305
PEOPLE BEING TAKEN OFF EVERY

00:03:25.371 --> 00:03:25.939
YEAR.

00:03:26.005 --> 00:03:28.675
SO ANYWAY I ASKED STAFF TO GET

00:03:28.741 --> 00:03:32.078
INTO THE LITTLE MORE DETAIL.

00:03:32.145 --> 00:03:35.415
ON THOSE DIFFERENT -- ITEMS

EACH INDIVIDUALLY DURING THIS

00:03:41.087 --> 00:03:42.922
HEARING SO WE WON'T BE VOTING ON

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:43.590
THEM.

00:03:43.656 --> 00:03:45.592
BUT I WANTED TO RAISE THE ISSUE

00:03:45.658 --> 00:03:46.125
THAT.

00:03:46.192 --> 00:03:47.894
I SO AT LEAST THE DEPARTMENT

00:03:47.961 --> 00:03:50.930
KNOWS WHY WE AREN'T BECAUSE OF

00:03:50.997 --> 00:03:54.634
THINGS LIKE LOOKING AT THE

00:03:54.701 --> 00:03:56.202

00:03:56.269 --> 00:03:59.005
REGISTRATION AND KNOWING WHAT WE

00:03:59.072 --> 00:04:00.840
APPROVED LAST YEAR.

00:04:00.907 --> 00:04:01.975
AND THE B. C. P. DOESN'T

00:04:02.041 --> 00:04:03.810
NECESSARILY.

00:04:03.876 --> 00:04:06.479
INCORPORATE ANY DISCUSSION OVER

00:04:06.546 --> 00:04:08.314
HOW WOULD USE THE FUNDS WE ARE A

00:04:18.324 --> 00:04:19.559
EXPLAIN THAT.

00:04:19.626 --> 00:04:23.296

I NAM THE MEN AND WOMEN AT THE

00:18:06.552 --> 00:18:08.787
BAR MAJOR SPECIES -- PROBING.

00:18:08.854 --> 00:18:10.289
I I'D SAY IT'S BEEN IT'S BUILT

00:18:10.355 --> 00:18:15.561
OVER TIME AND AS YOU KNOW AS AS

00:18:15.627 --> 00:18:17.696
SOMEONE WHO HAS RUN AN OPERATION.

00:18:17.763 --> 00:18:19.398
I DON'T HAVE TO CONTROL THE

00:18:19.465 --> 00:18:20.365
SALARIES FOR FOR THE PEOPLE.

00:18:20.432 --> 00:18:22.167
BARBARA JUSTICE THAT'S DONE BY

00:18:22.234 --> 00:18:24.203
DIFFERENT AGENCIES.

00:18:24.269 --> 00:18:25.571
HAVE AND SO WE TAKE THEM WITH

00:18:25.637 --> 00:18:27.039
THE SALARIES THAT THEY GET BASED

00:18:27.105 --> 00:18:28.507
ON THEIR NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE

00:18:28.574 --> 00:18:29.975
DIFFERENT AGENTS.

00:18:30.042 --> 00:18:31.210
WHAT HAS HAPPENED OVER TIME I

00:18:31.276 --> 00:18:32.678
THINK ESPECIALLY DURING THE TIME

00:18:32.744 --> 00:18:34.046
THAT WE HAD A REALLY?

00:18:34.112 --> 00:18:35.681
MASSIVE BUDGET DEFICIT IN THE

00:18:35.747 --> 00:18:37.316
STATE WHEN WE HAD A AND ECONOMIC

00:18:37.382 --> 00:18:38.450
TURNDOWN WAS.

00:18:38.517 --> 00:18:40.219
WE DIDN'T KEEP PACE.

00:18:40.285 --> 00:18:41.620
AND SO ONE OF THE WAYS THAT THE

00:18:41.687 --> 00:18:42.955
STATE WAS ABLE TO SAVE SOME

00:18:43.021 --> 00:18:43.355
MONEY.

00:18:43.422 --> 00:18:45.257
IN THE BUDGET TO MAKE UP FOR

00:18:45.324 --> 00:18:46.859
SHORTFALLS WESTON NOT INCREASE

00:18:46.925 --> 00:18:49.862
OUR AND FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF

00:18:49.928 --> 00:18:51.597
JUSTICE IS PROBABLY MORE CUTE

00:18:51.663 --> 00:18:55.067
THAN OTHER AGENCIES AS OUR

00:18:55.133 --> 00:18:55.834
ARCHERY FOR DOUBLE GO TO THE

00:18:55.901 --> 00:18:56.702
SUPREME COURT.

00:18:56.768 --> 00:18:58.737
MOST OTHER STATE AGENCY LAWYERS

00:18:58.804 --> 00:19:01.740
DON'T.

00:19:01.807 --> 00:19:02.407
WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE

00:19:02.474 --> 00:19:02.841
GETTING.

00:19:02.908 --> 00:19:06.178
TOP NOTCH IN EVERY RESPECT ARE

00:19:06.245 --> 00:19:08.347
YOUR J. AGENTS.

00:19:08.413 --> 00:19:09.948
THERE ARE NOT MANY.

00:19:10.015 --> 00:19:11.650
YOUR TO GO.

00:19:11.717 --> 00:19:12.651
SEEK OUT PEOPLE WHO ARE

00:19:12.718 --> 00:19:15.787
DANGEROUS. TO TRY TO DISARM

00:19:15.854 --> 00:19:16.421
THAT'S WHAT OUR AGENTS DO EVERY

00:19:16.488 --> 00:19:18.123
DAY.

00:19:18.190 --> 00:19:19.958
BUT IN THE PROCESS OVERSIGHT.

00:19:20.025 --> 00:19:20.959
THE SALARIES STOP BEING

00:19:21.026 --> 00:19:23.395
COMPETITIVE.

00:19:23.462 --> 00:19:24.763
OUR AGENTS FOR EXAMPLE IN LAW

00:19:24.830 --> 00:19:26.298
ENFORCEMENT BECAUSE OF THE

00:19:26.365 --> 00:19:28.033
CHANGEIN PENSIONS.

00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:29.801
TODAY IF AN AGENT IF AN OFFICER

00:19:29.868 --> 00:19:32.437
FROM ANOTHER AGENCY COMES UNDER

00:19:32.504 --> 00:19:34.039
THE OLD THE OLD PENSION SYSTEM.

00:19:34.106 --> 00:19:35.774
THEY WOULD LOSE MONEY COME AND

00:19:35.841 --> 00:19:37.175
WORK FOR US UNDER THE NEW

00:19:37.242 --> 00:19:38.076
PENSION SYSTEM.

00:19:38.143 --> 00:19:39.745
SO IT'S TOUGH TO RECRUIT

00:19:39.811 --> 00:19:40.712
OFTENTIMES ESPECIALLY WHEN

00:19:40.779 --> 00:19:43.515
SALARIES LOWER AND PENSION.

00:19:43.582 --> 00:19:47.352
BENEFITS WOULD TAKE A HIT SO DO

00:19:47.419 --> 00:19:47.519
YOU.

00:19:47.586 --> 00:19:49.655
WELL AT ALL TOGETHER.

00:19:49.721 --> 00:19:50.556
YES SO MUCH OF OUR WORK AS A

00:19:50.622 --> 00:19:51.823
BERNESE OCCURS IN THE BIG CITIES.

00:19:51.890 --> 00:19:53.025
YOU CAN IMAGINE HOW TOUGH IT IS

00:19:53.091 --> 00:19:53.525
TO RECRUIT A PARALEGAL.

00:19:53.592 --> 00:19:55.561
SAN FRANCISCO.

00:19:55.627 --> 00:19:57.696
AT THE STATE -- SALARIES FOR A

00:19:57.763 --> 00:19:59.731
PARALEGAL WE JUST CAN'T COMPETE

00:19:59.798 --> 00:20:02.134
WITH THE PRIVATE SECTOR MAKES IT

00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:02.367
TOUGH.

00:20:02.434 --> 00:20:04.937
SO THEN THE CENTER MORE LIKE THE

00:20:05.003 --> 00:20:05.537
POLISH SO I JUST WANTED HIM TO

00:20:05.604 --> 00:20:08.240
IT. TWO AT ON THIS VERY QUESTION

00:20:08.307 --> 00:20:10.208
IF YOU COULD EXPAND.

00:20:10.275 --> 00:20:12.344
AND THEN YOU PROCEED JUST.

00:20:12.411 --> 00:20:13.745
ORTIZ AGENTS THAT YOU'RE

00:20:13.812 --> 00:20:14.880
REFERRING TO ALL PART OF

00:20:14.947 --> 00:20:16.648
COLLECTIVE BARGAINING UNIT IN

00:20:16.715 --> 00:20:19.818
ISN'T THIS THE THE I MEAN THIS

00:20:19.885 --> 00:20:23.055
IS NOT A SALARY SCHEDULE THAT IS

00:20:23.121 --> 00:20:25.624
1100% DETERMINED BY A FIX.

00:20:25.691 --> 00:20:27.626
SO IF YOU COULD JUST SPEAK TO

00:20:27.693 --> 00:20:28.493
THE FACT THAT THEY ARE PART OF A

00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:30.462
COLLECTIVE BARGAINING UNIT ALL

00:20:30.529 --> 00:20:31.763
THE FACT EVERYONE OF THE

00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:32.598
PERSONNEL WHETHER IT'S THE

00:20:32.664 --> 00:20:34.833
ATTORNEYS. FOR THE PARALEGALS OR

00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:36.301
THE AGENTS ARE ALL PART OF A

00:20:36.368 --> 00:20:37.669
COLLECTIVE BARGAINING --

00:20:37.736 --> 00:20:40.238
AGREEMENT AND SO THEY ARE.

00:20:40.305 --> 00:20:42.074
FIXED WITH ALL THEIR OTHER

00:20:42.140 --> 00:20:42.941
COLLEAGUES IN THE SAME

00:20:43.008 --> 00:20:44.276
CLASSIFICATION.

00:20:44.343 --> 00:20:47.346
IN THAT THEY NEGOTIATED GOSHI

00:20:47.412 --> 00:20:48.614
YEAH AND THAT'S GOING TO MY

00:20:48.680 --> 00:20:50.816
POINT MANAGER I DON'T NEGOTIATE

00:20:50.882 --> 00:20:51.450
WITH THEM THAT'S I DON'T EVEN

00:20:51.516 --> 00:20:53.485
COULD CONDUCT THE NEGOTIATION

00:20:53.552 --> 00:20:53.986
WITH THEM.%

00:20:54.052 --> 00:20:56.588
AND I DON'T GET TO CHANGE THAT I

00:20:56.655 --> 00:20:57.389
GET.

00:20:57.456 --> 00:20:59.091
WHAT THE NEGOTIATIONS?

00:20:59.157 --> 00:21:01.126
RESULTED IN.

00:21:01.193 --> 00:21:01.994
AND BY WHAT THE YOUR OFFICE

00:21:02.060 --> 00:21:04.596
DOZEN NEGOTIATE WITH THEM SORRY

00:21:04.663 --> 00:21:06.064
IT'S DONE BY THE BOSS GO AHEAD.

00:21:06.131 --> 00:21:08.767
IF THEM BY THE HUMAN RESOURCES

00:21:08.834 --> 00:21:10.135
AGENCY FOR THE STATE THEY GOT

00:21:10.202 --> 00:21:11.269
BECAUSE IT STATEWIDE IT'S NOT

00:21:11.336 --> 00:21:13.171
JUST THE O. J. AGENTS WERE PART

00:21:13.238 --> 00:21:14.406
OF THAT CLASSIFICATION STATUS

00:21:14.473 --> 00:21:16.875
DOJ ATTORNEYS WERE PART OF THE

00:21:16.942 --> 00:21:19.111
ATTORNEYS -- BARGAINING UNIT

00:21:19.177 --> 00:21:21.947
IT'S STATEWIDE AND SO THEY ARE

00:21:22.014 --> 00:21:23.882
STATEWIDE BARGAIN DIRECTLY WITH

00:21:23.949 --> 00:21:26.785
THE STATE AGENCY IN CHARGE WITH

00:21:26.852 --> 00:21:27.719
THAT.

00:21:27.786 --> 00:21:29.888
WELL THEN IF IT'S A STATE WHY

00:21:29.955 --> 00:21:30.288
WELL.

00:21:30.355 --> 00:21:31.356
JUST.

00:21:31.423 --> 00:21:34.493
IT'S HARD.

00:21:34.559 --> 00:21:37.162
IT'S HARD TO PRECIADO THAT THE

00:21:37.229 --> 00:21:38.797
ISSUE FOR US ROUTE WITH

00:21:38.864 --> 00:21:41.500
RETENTION IS.

00:21:41.566 --> 00:21:45.170
THE SALARY AND BENEFITS.

00:21:45.237 --> 00:21:46.838
WHEN THE ENTITY?

00:21:46.905 --> 00:21:48.573
THAT THE IF THEY'VE NEGOTIATED

00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:51.743
THE SALARY AND BENEFITS AND IT'S

00:21:51.810 --> 00:21:54.913
NOT A FIXED SALARY SCHEDULE THAT

00:21:54.980 --> 00:21:56.214
THE STATE IS DETERMINED.

00:21:56.281 --> 00:21:57.582
AND IT'S NOT EVEN SOMETHING THAT

00:21:57.649 --> 00:21:58.717
THIS COMMITTEE COULD TRY TO

00:21:58.784 --> 00:22:00.252
CHANGE BY TRYING TO PROVIDE YOU

00:22:00.318 --> 00:22:01.586
WITH MORE RESOURCES IT WOULDN'T

00:22:01.653 --> 00:22:03.021
GO TO SALARY.

00:22:03.088 --> 00:22:04.923
I POINT THAT OUT SIMPLY TO

00:22:04.990 --> 00:22:06.191
DEMONSTRATE HOW DIFFICULT IT IS

00:22:06.258 --> 00:22:08.026
SOMETIMES TO MEET THE NEEDS OF

00:22:08.093 --> 00:22:09.661
WHETHER IT'S RETRIEVING WEAPONS.

00:22:09.728 --> 00:22:12.330
OR FINDING THE SKILLED ATTORNEYS

00:22:12.397 --> 00:22:12.564
WE NEED.

00:22:12.631 --> 00:22:13.398
WITH CREAM COURT.

00:22:13.465 --> 00:22:14.332
OPINION I JUST WITH THE

00:22:14.399 --> 00:22:16.168
RESOURCES THAT WE GET TO DO OUR

00:22:16.234 --> 00:22:16.601
JOB.

00:22:16.668 --> 00:22:18.303
FROM YOU BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO

00:22:18.370 --> 00:22:19.304
COMPLY.

00:22:19.371 --> 00:22:20.672
WITH THE OUTSIDE SECTOR WHEN YOU

00:22:20.739 --> 00:22:21.707
GOT A COLLECTIVE BARGAINING

00:22:21.773 --> 00:22:23.108
AGREEMENT THAT SETS THE TERMS OF

00:22:23.175 --> 00:22:26.278
EMPLOYMENT PAY AND COMPENSATION.

00:22:26.344 --> 00:22:27.646
CENTER MORE LIKELY THAT YOU GET

00:22:27.713 --> 00:22:29.514
TO MANAGE THROUGH THAT COULD YOU

00:22:29.581 --> 00:22:31.817
STILL HAVE TO GET THE JOB DONE.

00:22:31.883 --> 00:22:33.218
HE BROUGHT BUT SHOULD LOWERS SO

00:22:33.285 --> 00:22:34.252
THEN YOU WERE WORK WERE

00:22:34.319 --> 00:22:36.321
CONCERNED ABOUT A. P..

00:22:36.388 --> 00:22:37.889
IN.

00:22:37.956 --> 00:22:39.091
THAT THAT YOU HIGHER.

00:22:39.157 --> 00:22:40.225
INDIVIDUALS THAT REQUIRE A

00:22:40.292 --> 00:22:42.661
COLLEGE EDUCATION AS A MINIMUM.

00:22:42.728 --> 00:22:47.165
WHICH MAKES IT DIFFICULT -- SO

00:22:47.232 --> 00:22:47.966
IS THERE A DIFFERENT WAY TO LOOK

00:22:48.033 --> 00:22:49.668
AT HOW WE PURSUE THIS BECAUSE

00:22:49.735 --> 00:22:50.602
YOU MENTIONED IN OUR OUR

00:22:50.669 --> 00:22:51.870
DISCUSSION THAT.

00:22:51.937 --> 00:22:53.338
YOU KNOW IF WE GET IT ALL DONE

00:22:53.405 --> 00:22:54.806
AT THE FRONT END THAT WOULD BE

00:22:54.873 --> 00:22:56.241
MUCH MORE HELPFUL THAN YOU

00:22:56.308 --> 00:22:58.977
COMING BACK IN THE MAKING THE

00:22:59.044 --> 00:22:59.411
THREE CONTACT YEAH.

00:22:59.478 --> 00:23:00.746
SO THEN.

00:23:00.812 --> 00:23:02.414
INSTEAD OF LOOKING AT HIRING

00:23:02.481 --> 00:23:03.582
STAFF.

00:23:03.648 --> 00:23:05.150
IS THERE A WAY FOR YOU TO SAY TO

00:23:05.217 --> 00:23:06.618
A POLICE DEPARTMENT.

00:23:06.685 --> 00:23:08.653
YOU TAKE CARE OF IT.

00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:11.990
AND BILL IS THE TIME.

00:23:12.057 --> 00:23:13.024
AND THEN WILL REIMBURSE YOU AT

00:23:13.091 --> 00:23:14.626
THEIR HOURLY RATE.

00:23:14.693 --> 00:23:16.061
IN THAT WOULD.

00:23:16.128 --> 00:23:17.662
MAYBE TAKE CARE OF YOUR MANPOWER

00:23:17.729 --> 00:23:19.631
SHORTAGE WHAT REMEMBER EVEN IF

00:23:19.698 --> 00:23:21.433
WE WERE TO GO THAT ROUTE.

00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:22.434
THEY'RE BILLING RATES ARE HIGHER

00:23:22.501 --> 00:23:24.136
THAN OURS SO WE HAVE TO END UP

00:23:24.202 --> 00:23:26.104
PAYING MORE FOR THE SAME SERVICE.

00:23:26.171 --> 00:23:27.305
AND THEY ARE LIMITED BECAUSE

00:23:27.372 --> 00:23:27.906
WHAT YOU'RE JUST PAYING AN

00:23:27.973 --> 00:23:29.207
HOURLY RATE YOU WOULD BE PAYING

00:23:29.274 --> 00:23:31.243
FOR A FULL TIME EQUIVALENT U. F.

00:23:31.309 --> 00:23:32.577
TO EASE SO YOU'RE.

00:23:32.644 --> 00:23:33.712
RIGHT BUT IF YOU WANT TO GET THE

00:23:33.779 --> 00:23:36.214
SAME PRODUCTION OVER ONE HOUR

00:23:36.281 --> 00:23:37.883
FOR ONE DAY OR ONE YEAR IF YOU

00:23:37.949 --> 00:23:39.818
STILL ARE PAYING MORE PER HOUR

00:23:39.885 --> 00:23:40.886
PER.

00:23:40.952 --> 00:23:42.487
MONTH PER YEAR.

00:23:42.554 --> 00:23:43.955
WHAT WE COULD DO AND THIS IS

00:23:44.022 --> 00:23:45.724
WHERE THAT WE TO GETTING DIED

00:23:45.791 --> 00:23:47.759
THIS PAST YEAR AND WHEN WE

00:23:47.826 --> 00:23:49.628
ISSUED A REPORT?

00:23:49.694 --> 00:23:50.195
FOR TWENTY EIGHTEEN WHAT WE

00:23:50.262 --> 00:23:51.530
FOUND IS THAT THERE IS THIS

00:23:51.596 --> 00:23:52.798
ABSOLUTELY.

00:23:52.864 --> 00:23:54.166
AN OPPORTUNITY TO FOR MORE

00:23:54.232 --> 00:23:55.801
COLLABORATION WITH LOCAL LAW

00:23:55.867 --> 00:23:56.835
ENFORCEMENT.

00:23:56.902 --> 00:23:58.303
BECAUSE AS AS YOU JUST MENTIONED

00:23:58.370 --> 00:24:00.038
CENTER WE SHOULD NOT BE TRYING

00:24:00.105 --> 00:24:02.440
TO RETRIEVE WEAPONS WELL AFTER

00:24:02.507 --> 00:24:04.743
THE DANGERS PERSON HAS BEEN.

00:24:04.810 --> 00:24:07.045
ON THE STREETS OR WHO KNOWS

00:24:07.112 --> 00:24:08.213
WHERE WITHIN CITY CALIFORNIA WE

00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:10.081
SHOULD RETRIEVE THAT WEAPON WHEN

00:24:10.148 --> 00:24:11.516
WE HAD THE PERSON IN CUSTODY.

00:24:11.583 --> 00:24:13.084
AS BEST WE CAN SO WORKING BETTER

00:24:13.151 --> 00:24:14.786
WITH THE COURTS WORKING BETTER

00:24:14.853 --> 00:24:16.354
WITH PROSECUTORS AND LOCAL LAW

00:24:16.421 --> 00:24:17.622
ENFORCEMENT WE SHOULD TRY TO

00:24:17.689 --> 00:24:19.191
MAKE SURE THAT BEFORE.

00:24:19.257 --> 00:24:22.027
WE THAT PERSON LEAVES ARE.

00:24:22.093 --> 00:24:23.461
OFFICIAL GRASP.

00:24:23.528 --> 00:24:24.930
WE'VE TRIED TO REMOVE THE WEAPON

00:24:24.996 --> 00:24:26.164
FROM SOMEONE WHO'S CLEARLY LOST

00:24:26.231 --> 00:24:27.299
THE RIGHT TO POSSESS IT.

00:24:27.365 --> 00:24:27.899
AND THAT'S WHERE THE

00:24:27.966 --> 00:24:28.867
COORDINATION WHICH REALLY

00:24:28.934 --> 00:24:30.735
SHOULDN'T COST.

00:24:30.802 --> 00:24:32.204
OF TOO MUCH MONEY I THINK THE

00:24:32.270 --> 00:24:33.572
LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT FOLKS WILL

00:24:33.638 --> 00:24:34.105
TELL YOU WE'RE GONNA NEED

00:24:34.172 --> 00:24:34.873
SOMEBODY.

00:24:34.940 --> 00:24:36.208
TO SHIFT SOME OF OUR RESOURCES

00:24:36.274 --> 00:24:37.642
TO DO THIS WORK WITH YOU.

00:24:37.709 --> 00:24:39.778
BUT THAT'S ABSOLUTELY WILL BE A

00:24:39.845 --> 00:24:41.513
FOR MORE EFFICIENT WAY THAN JUST

00:24:41.580 --> 00:24:43.415
HIRING UP A BIGGER FORCE.

00:24:43.481 --> 00:24:44.482
I WANT TO AFFIRM YOU FOR STAYING

00:24:44.549 --> 00:24:46.051
CURRENT.

THANK YOU A LARGE NUMBER EVERY

WE STILL WE STILL GOT A CRACKED

00:24:52.457 --> 00:24:53.758
THE BIG NOT THAT JUST KINDA

00:24:53.825 --> 00:24:56.428

ME BECAUSE WE ARE USING.

00:25:11.943 --> 00:25:16.381
A IT EQUIPMENT THAT -- I THINK

00:25:16.448 --> 00:25:17.749
EVEN BILL GATES WAS IN A BILLION

00:25:17.816 --> 00:25:19.050
OR AT THE TIME THAT WE STARTED

00:25:19.117 --> 00:25:20.852
USING THIS EQUIPMENT AND SO --

00:25:20.919 --> 00:25:23.755
IT IT IS EXTREMELY OBSOLETE AND

00:25:23.822 --> 00:25:25.156
IT DOES SLOW THINGS DOWN BUT

00:25:25.223 --> 00:25:26.825
IT'S A BIG SYSTEM.

00:25:26.892 --> 00:25:28.226
BECAUSE WE HAVE TO TRACK SO MANY

00:25:28.293 --> 00:25:29.895
DIFFERENT DATA POINTS.

00:25:29.961 --> 00:25:31.296
IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT YOU JUST

00:25:31.363 --> 00:25:33.131
SORT OF BY THE NEW COMPUTER AND

00:25:33.198 --> 00:25:34.499
WE BUT WE WILL NEED TO MOVE

00:25:34.566 --> 00:25:36.701
BECAUSE IT JUST THE VOLUME OF

00:25:36.768 --> 00:25:38.370
INDIVIDUALS THAT ENTER INTO THE

00:25:38.436 --> 00:25:40.672
APPS SYSTEM OR COULD.

00:25:40.739 --> 00:25:42.807
HAS GROWN AND WE NEED TO TRY TO

00:25:42.874 --> 00:25:44.943
KEEP PACE AND THE BETTER WE CAN

00:25:45.010 --> 00:25:46.878
DO IT TO EFFICIENCY FIRST JUST

00:25:46.945 --> 00:25:49.147
STAFFING UP.

00:25:49.214 --> 00:25:50.382
THE BETTER ALL THIS WILL BE.

00:25:50.448 --> 00:25:52.617
AND THEN I'M.

00:25:52.684 --> 00:25:57.689
WE HAD A  KID A A A BILL AB

WHEN I WAS GOING THROUGH THE

GOVERNOR LISA FINISHES HIS TIME.

00:30:59.591 --> 00:31:01.226

SO THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OF

00:31:40.665 --> 00:31:42.100
THE WANT TO PROSECUTE THE CASES

00:31:42.166 --> 00:31:43.534

THE BEST PRACTICES THAT ARE OUT

THERE THAT WE KNOW OF AND WE TRY

00:39:50.087 --> 00:39:50.988
TO INSTITUTE THOSE AS BEST WE

00:39:51.055 --> 00:39:52.923
CAN WE JUST FINISHED -- THE

00:39:52.990 --> 00:39:55.559
FIRST HALF OF REPORT WE DID --

INVOLVING THE SACRAMENTO POLICE

00:39:57.595 --> 00:39:59.764
DEPARTMENT -- WHICH I BEGAN LAST

00:39:59.830 --> 00:40:03.100
YEAR AS A RESULT OF CHIEF --

PRACTICES AND AND POLICIES AND

00:40:12.276 --> 00:40:13.811
WE'VE IDENTIFIED A NUMBER OF THE

00:40:13.878 --> 00:40:15.012
PRACTICES THAT ARE OUT AROUND

00:40:15.079 --> 00:40:16.180
THE COUNTRY CLICK HERE

00:40:16.247 --> 00:40:17.615
CALIFORNIA ALREADY.

00:40:17.681 --> 00:40:18.716
THAT SEEM TO BE THE MOST

00:40:18.783 --> 00:40:20.084
PROMISING WHEN IT COMES TO

00:40:20.151 --> 00:40:21.719
TRYING TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF

00:40:21.786 --> 00:40:22.753
USE OF FORCE.

00:40:22.820 --> 00:40:23.854
SO WE AT THE DEPARTMENT OF

00:40:23.921 --> 00:40:24.688
JUSTICE TRY TO MAKE SURE THAT

00:40:24.755 --> 00:40:27.191
WE'RE TELLING FOLKS WHAT SOME OF

00:40:27.258 --> 00:40:28.826
THE BEST PRACTICES ARE WE TRY.

00:40:28.893 --> 00:40:30.294
TO WHAT DOES A DEFECT IN IN OUR

00:40:30.361 --> 00:40:30.961
DEPARTMENT.

00:40:31.028 --> 00:40:32.363
AT THIS QUICKLY AS WE CAN AS

00:40:32.429 --> 00:40:33.497
WELL.

00:40:33.564 --> 00:40:34.098
AND I THINK WHAT YOU'RE GONNA

00:40:34.165 --> 00:40:36.133
FIND IS AS THIS WHOLE DEBATE

00:40:36.200 --> 00:40:38.969
MOVES FORWARD ON USE OF FORCE

00:40:39.036 --> 00:40:40.271
AND WHERE.

00:40:40.337 --> 00:40:42.239
THANK YOU MAY WE TURN TO GO I

00:40:42.306 --> 00:40:43.107
THINK WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO FIND

00:40:43.174 --> 00:40:44.675
IS THAT MORE MORE INCLUDING WITH

00:40:44.742 --> 00:40:47.011
THE SUPPORT OF LAW ENFORCEMENT

00:40:47.077 --> 00:40:47.645
AGENCIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF

00:40:47.711 --> 00:40:48.779
CALIFORNIA.

00:40:48.846 --> 00:40:49.914
THE TRAINING.

00:40:49.980 --> 00:40:52.049
THE PROTOCOLS.

00:40:52.116 --> 00:40:53.384
ARE ARE GONNA BECOME REALLY

00:40:53.450 --> 00:40:56.020
IMPORTANT AND ESPECIALLY SHOWING

00:40:56.086 --> 00:40:56.720
THAT THERE WILL BE

00:40:56.787 --> 00:40:58.689
ACCOUNTABILITY IS A RESULT OF

00:40:58.756 --> 00:41:00.157
THAT TRAINING IN THOSE PROTOCOS.

00:41:00.224 --> 00:41:01.358
AND SHOW TO YOUR POINT BECAUSE I

00:41:01.425 --> 00:41:03.527
THINK YOU'RE RIGHT THERE IS NO

00:41:03.594 --> 00:41:05.329
ONE STANDARD WHEN IT COMES TO

00:41:05.396 --> 00:41:06.330
TRAINING.

00:41:06.397 --> 00:41:07.164
EVERY AGENCY CAN DO WHAT IT

00:41:07.231 --> 00:41:08.799
WANTS NOT EVERY AGENCY

00:41:08.866 --> 00:41:10.167
PARTICIPATES IN POSTAGE

00:41:10.234 --> 00:41:11.402
VOLUNTARY.

00:41:11.468 --> 00:41:13.604
POST IS OUR STATEWIDE AGENCY TO

00:41:13.671 --> 00:41:15.139
TRY TO PROVIDE THAT GUIDANCE AND

00:41:15.206 --> 00:41:15.873
TRAINING.

00:41:15.940 --> 00:41:17.374
AND I THINK THE MORE WE GET INTO

00:41:17.441 --> 00:41:18.809
A STANDARDIZED SYSTEM SO THAT

00:41:18.876 --> 00:41:20.211
EVERYONE KNOWS WHAT THIS THE

00:41:20.277 --> 00:41:22.046
FLOOR AT LEAST OF TRAINING MUST

00:41:22.112 --> 00:41:22.213
BE.

00:41:22.279 --> 00:41:23.814
I THINK WE'LL PROBABLY GET

00:41:23.881 --> 00:41:25.149
CLOSER TO FINDING A WAY TO

00:41:25.216 --> 00:41:27.017
ADDRESS THE CONCERNS PEOPLE HAVE

00:41:27.084 --> 00:41:29.587
ABOUT USE OF FORCE.

00:41:29.653 --> 00:41:30.988
THERE'S THERE'S PEOPLE THAT.

00:41:31.055 --> 00:41:31.655
JUST KIND OF ONE OF THE PROBLEMS

00:41:31.722 --> 00:41:34.491
I OBSERVED IS THERE'S PEOPLE FOR

00:41:34.558 --> 00:41:36.293
THESE ON REGISTERED ALL KHôNG

00:41:36.360 --> 00:41:37.461
TRAINERS.

00:41:37.528 --> 00:41:38.829
THERE'S PEOPLE THAT ARE BROUGHT

00:41:38.896 --> 00:41:40.598
IN FROM OUTSIDE A CALIFORNIA

00:41:40.664 --> 00:41:42.433
THEIR THEIR THEIR PEOPLE THAT

00:41:42.499 --> 00:41:46.103
ARE NOT FAMILIAR WITH CALIFORNIA

00:41:46.170 --> 00:41:47.538
LAWS.

00:41:47.605 --> 00:41:50.040
YOU KNOW THAT WE APPROVE.

00:41:50.107 --> 00:41:51.442
AND THEN THEY TRAIN LAW

00:41:51.508 --> 00:41:54.478
ENFORCEMENT ON THE USE OF FORCE

00:41:54.545 --> 00:41:58.015
BASED ON OF CURRICULUM THAT THEY

00:41:58.082 --> 00:41:59.350
DEVELOP AND THEN THEY FOR MEN

00:41:59.416 --> 00:42:02.019
AND TRAIN OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT

00:42:02.086 --> 00:42:02.987
CALIFORNIA.

00:42:03.053 --> 00:42:05.456
PEACE OFFICERS -- ON THE USE OF

00:42:05.522 --> 00:42:07.358
FORCE THEY HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE OF

00:42:07.424 --> 00:42:10.094
OR VERY LIMITED YOU KNOW NO

00:42:10.160 --> 00:42:13.197
CREDENTIALED KNOWLEDGE OF LOS.

00:42:13.264 --> 00:42:15.833
AND THAT KIND OF DISTURBS ME A

00:42:15.900 --> 00:42:17.334
LITTLE BIT OKAY.

00:42:17.401 --> 00:42:19.003
BECAUSE HOW CAN THEY TRAIN

00:42:19.069 --> 00:42:20.704
SOMEBODY ON USE OF FORCE WITHOUT

00:42:20.771 --> 00:42:22.673
KNOWING WHAT THE CALIFORNIA LAWS

00:42:22.740 --> 00:42:25.976
OR AND AND THEY MAY BE DIFFERENT

00:42:26.043 --> 00:42:27.478
THAN.

00:42:27.544 --> 00:42:29.113
IN GEORGIA OR FLORIDA OR SOME

00:42:29.179 --> 00:42:31.181
OTHER PLACE.

00:42:31.248 --> 00:42:32.082
AND I DON'T I DON'T I DON'T

00:42:32.149 --> 00:42:34.151
THINK.

00:42:34.218 --> 00:42:37.121
THEREIS ANY REGISTRATION

00:42:37.187 --> 00:42:39.423
QUALITY CONTROL.

00:42:39.490 --> 00:42:41.158
YOU KNOW I I SEE SOME OF THE

00:42:41.225 --> 00:42:46.363
VIDEOS IS SERVE LIKE.

00:42:46.430 --> 00:42:48.732
YOU KNOW SUBJECTIVE.

00:42:48.799 --> 00:42:50.501
YOU KNOW THINKING.

00:42:50.567 --> 00:42:53.037
WARY IF YOU THINK SOMETHING'S

00:42:53.103 --> 00:42:54.805
GOING TO HAPPEN AND YOU BETTER

00:42:54.872 --> 00:42:56.907
ACT FAST BECAUSE YOU KNOW YOU

00:42:56.974 --> 00:42:58.709
COULD BE IN DANGER YOUR PERSONAL

00:42:58.776 --> 00:42:59.677
SAFETY.

00:42:59.743 --> 00:43:03.013
SO THIS KIND OF FACTORS ARE VERY --

00:43:03.080 --> 00:43:06.517
VERY IMPORTANT -- AND AND I

00:43:06.583 --> 00:43:07.818
THINK THE PUBLIC IS CONCERNED

00:43:07.885 --> 00:43:10.421
ABOUT THIS AND WE HAVE LAWS ON

00:43:10.487 --> 00:43:13.257
THIS COMING UP -- I I WOULD

00:43:13.324 --> 00:43:16.460
APPRECIATE YOUR INVESTIGATION OF

00:43:16.527 --> 00:43:19.396
THAT THE UNREGISTERED.

00:43:19.463 --> 00:43:22.800
PEOPLE THAT COME IN THERE'S NO.

00:43:22.866 --> 00:43:24.134
AND PERHAPS YOU COULD ADVISE US

00:43:24.201 --> 00:43:26.203
ON A PROPER LAW THAT COULD BE

00:43:26.270 --> 00:43:27.137
DEVELOPED.

00:43:27.204 --> 00:43:28.706
REGARDING THAT.

00:43:28.772 --> 00:43:30.507
I CAN ARE YOU.

00:43:30.574 --> 00:43:32.643
RIGHT OFF THE BAT BECAUSE

00:43:32.710 --> 00:43:34.511
TRAINING IS NOT SOMETHING THAT

00:43:34.578 --> 00:43:38.682
IS LEGISLATIVE.

00:43:38.749 --> 00:43:40.150
RIGHT CALIFORNIA STATUTE AND

00:43:40.217 --> 00:43:41.118
THAT EACH AGENCY WHOSE ABOUT THE

00:43:41.185 --> 00:43:43.120
PROCESS OF GETTING THE TRAINING

00:43:43.187 --> 00:43:45.856
AND THE AND THE START AT NEW

00:43:45.923 --> 00:43:47.057
PEOPLE TO START UP.

00:43:47.124 --> 00:43:48.926
BASED ON TRAINING THAT THEY

00:43:48.993 --> 00:43:53.163
RECEIVED THAT -- I WOULD I WOULD

00:43:53.230 --> 00:43:54.798
AGREE THAT THERE'S A NEED TO TRY

00:43:54.865 --> 00:43:56.333
TO STANDARDIZE THE TRAINING THAT

00:43:56.400 --> 00:43:57.701
WE UNDERSTAND THAT ANYONE WHO

00:43:57.768 --> 00:44:00.371
WORKS LAW ENFORCEMENT CALIFORNIA.

00:44:00.437 --> 00:44:01.939
AS ESSENTIALLY RECEIVED LEAST

00:44:02.006 --> 00:44:03.807
THAT MINIMAL AMOUNT THAT WE

00:44:03.874 --> 00:44:05.476
THINK WOULD BE REQUIRED BEFORE

00:44:05.542 --> 00:44:08.312
YOU START -- PATROLLING STREETS.

00:44:08.379 --> 00:44:09.380
WHETHER YOU COULD ACTUALLY

00:44:09.446 --> 00:44:12.216
STANDARDIZED IT.

00:44:12.282 --> 00:44:14.284
IN A WAY BY STATUTE IS ANOTHER

00:44:14.351 --> 00:44:16.653
QUESTION BECAUSE WITH YOUR RURAL

00:44:16.720 --> 00:44:18.522
LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY VERSES LA

00:44:18.589 --> 00:44:19.323
COUNTY.

00:44:19.390 --> 00:44:20.824
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE DIFFERENT

00:44:20.891 --> 00:44:22.459
CIRCUMSTANCES THAT APPLY AND

00:44:22.526 --> 00:44:24.061
ALTHOUGH I THINK IF SO LONG AS

00:44:24.128 --> 00:44:25.396
WE'RE LOOKING AT THIS AND

00:44:25.462 --> 00:44:25.996
UNDERSTANDING THAT WERE WHAT

00:44:26.063 --> 00:44:27.831
WHICH WE'RE WE'RE MOVING TOWARDS

00:44:27.898 --> 00:44:29.366
THE BEST PRACTICES.

00:44:29.433 --> 00:44:31.068
AND THOSE BEST PRACTICES HAVE TO

00:44:31.135 --> 00:44:32.836
BE NEW ONES FOR THE DIFFERENT.

00:44:32.903 --> 00:44:35.372

LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY AND I

00:44:36.874 --> 00:44:37.374
THINK WE'LL GET THERE AND I

00:44:37.441 --> 00:44:38.442
THINK YOU'RE GONNA HAVE THE

00:44:38.509 --> 00:44:39.943
SUPPORT OF LAW ENFORCEMENT.

00:44:40.010 --> 00:44:41.578
YEAH I THINK OF MY IDEAS LIKE

00:44:41.645 --> 00:44:43.247
SOMEBODY OUGHT TO BE LOOKING AT

00:44:43.313 --> 00:44:47.718
THESE CURRICULUMS THE MAN.

00:44:47.785 --> 00:44:48.452

WHERE THEY COME IN FROM

00:44:49.319 --> 00:44:50.354
DIFFERENT PLACES.

00:44:50.421 --> 00:44:51.388
AND THEN SOMEBODY ELSE SAY WELL

00:44:51.455 --> 00:44:53.023
THAT'S OKAY THAT ONE MEETS OUR

00:44:53.090 --> 00:44:54.391
STANDARDS.

00:44:54.458 --> 00:44:56.093
I WAS ON SOME KIND OF PROCESS

00:44:56.160 --> 00:44:57.194
FOR THAT YOU KNOW.

00:44:57.261 --> 00:44:58.162
AND I WILL SAY THAT THERE IS A

00:44:58.228 --> 00:45:00.264
LOT OF PROFESSIONALISM IN THIS

00:45:00.330 --> 00:45:02.066
AREA WHERE YOU HAVE.

00:45:02.132 --> 00:45:03.867
A NUMBER OF ENTITIES AND

00:45:03.934 --> 00:45:06.937
AGENCIES THAT HAVE TAKEN ON THE

00:45:07.004 --> 00:45:08.005
TASK OF TRYING TO FIGURE OUT.

00:45:08.072 --> 00:45:09.673
THOSE BEST PRACTICES AND SO YOU

00:45:09.740 --> 00:45:11.308

00:45:35.766 --> 00:45:37.968
AGENCIES DECIDE THEY DON'T WANT

00:45:38.035 --> 00:45:39.336
TO ENFORCE OUR LAWS.

00:45:39.403 --> 00:45:41.338
OKAY OR OTHER AGENCIES THEY DO

00:53:31.775 --> 00:53:34.377
GO TO OTHER UNTIL AS WELL -- BUT

00:53:34.444 --> 00:53:36.713
WE DID HAVE LIMITED -- ACCESS

00:53:36.780 --> 00:53:38.548
BECAUSE ICE WOULD BURST

00:53:38.615 --> 00:53:40.917
RESTRICTED HOW MUCH WE COULD DO

00:53:40.984 --> 00:53:42.252
BUT WE HAVE.

00:53:42.319 --> 00:53:44.187
ADDED LITIGATE THAT LAW THAT

00:53:44.254 --> 00:53:45.322
THIS LEGISLATURE PASSED THEY

00:53:45.388 --> 00:53:47.257
GAVE US THE AUTHORITY.

00:53:47.324 --> 00:53:49.092
TO INSPECT THE VARIOUS I THINK

00:53:49.159 --> 00:53:50.193
OR TEN OR ELEVEN DETENTION

00:53:50.260 --> 00:53:50.493
FACILITIES.

00:53:50.560 --> 00:53:52.963
AND WE HAD IT HAS SURVIVED A

00:53:53.029 --> 00:53:54.631
TESTED IN COURT AND SO WE

00:53:54.698 --> 00:53:56.833
CONTINUE TO INSPECT I WILL AS

00:53:56.900 --> 00:53:58.068
YOU MENTIONED SENATOR I THINK

00:53:58.134 --> 00:53:59.169
IT'S AN IMPORTANT POINT.

00:53:59.235 --> 00:54:01.004
MANY OF THESE COMMUNITIES AND

00:54:01.071 --> 00:54:02.238
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE MOVING

00:54:02.305 --> 00:54:03.873
AWAY FROM TRYING TO REACH

00:54:03.940 --> 00:54:05.475
CONTRACTS WITH ICE TO DO THE

00:54:05.542 --> 00:54:06.843
DETENTION WORK.

00:54:06.910 --> 00:54:08.545
BECAUSE THEY DO HAVE.

00:54:08.612 --> 00:54:09.879
SOME LIMITED CONTROL OVER WHAT'S

00:54:09.946 --> 00:54:10.847
DONE.

00:54:10.914 --> 00:54:12.015
AND AND I THINK SOME OF THESE

00:54:12.082 --> 00:54:16.353
JURISDICTIONS ARE MOVING AWAY

00:54:16.419 --> 00:54:17.654
FROM DOING THAT.

00:54:17.721 --> 00:54:19.089
YEAH THE DISABILITY RIGHTS SO

00:54:19.155 --> 00:54:20.090
ORGANIZATION THAT DID REPORT

00:54:20.156 --> 00:54:20.824
THEY HAVE A FEDERALLY.

00:54:20.890 --> 00:54:23.059
A FEDERAL STATUTE RIGHT TO

00:54:23.126 --> 00:54:25.328
INSPECT THOSE FACILITIES AS WELL

00:54:25.395 --> 00:54:27.130
AS A STATE STATUTE RIGHT TO

00:54:27.197 --> 00:54:29.065
EXPECT THOSE FACILITIES WITHOUT

00:54:29.132 --> 00:54:30.300
HINDRANCE.

00:54:30.367 --> 00:54:32.302
SO THEY'RE ALLOWED A MUCH

00:54:32.369 --> 00:54:32.969
BROADER.

00:54:33.036 --> 00:54:35.171
OF ALLOWANCE FOR INSPECTING TO

00:54:35.238 --> 00:54:36.640
DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT CIVIL

00:54:36.706 --> 00:54:43.613
RIGHTS ON THE DISABILITIES KLAY --

00:54:43.680 --> 00:54:47.984
PRESENTED -- THE INFORMATION. TO

00:54:48.051 --> 00:54:49.486
OUR MENTAL HEALTH CAUCUS IN THE

00:54:49.552 --> 00:54:51.187
SENATE.

00:54:51.254 --> 00:54:52.889
THEY CAME TO OUR MEETING AND DID

00:54:52.956 --> 00:54:55.125
A PRESENTATION ABOUT.

00:54:55.191 --> 00:54:57.994
EXACTLY WHAT WAS HAPPENING.

00:54:58.061 --> 00:55:00.797
IN THOSE FACILITIES AND WE WERE

00:55:00.864 --> 00:55:02.999
SHOCKED WE WERE QUITE FRANKLY

00:55:03.066 --> 00:55:05.268
SHOCKED AT THE WAY CHILDREN ARE

00:55:05.335 --> 00:55:07.704
TREATED AS PRISON INMATES.

00:55:07.771 --> 00:55:09.673
AND I THINK ESPECIALLY WITH THE

00:55:09.739 --> 00:55:11.207
KIDS AND THE WAY THEY'RE BEING

00:55:11.274 --> 00:55:12.075
TREATED.

00:55:12.142 --> 00:55:13.176
WE NEED TO WE NEED TO ACT

00:55:13.243 --> 00:55:15.011
QUICKLY TO PREVENT ANY OF THESE

00:55:15.078 --> 00:55:16.579
FACILITIES EVER TREATED

00:55:16.646 --> 00:55:18.748
CHILDREN'S AS PRISONERS IN IN IN

00:55:18.815 --> 00:55:19.749
A AND TOLERABLE.

00:55:19.816 --> 00:55:20.850
MANNER.

00:55:20.917 --> 00:55:22.552
AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES AS

00:55:22.619 --> 00:55:23.753
WELL THEY WERE TREATING PEOPLE

00:55:23.820 --> 00:55:25.221
WITH DISABILITIES OF SOMEBODY

00:55:25.288 --> 00:55:28.425
HAD A FOR EXAMPLE SOMEBODY HAD.

00:55:28.491 --> 00:55:32.996
A MENTAL HEALTH OF TRAUMA.

00:55:33.063 --> 00:55:35.565
REACTION TO BEING IN IN ONE OF

00:55:35.632 --> 00:55:37.434
THOSE FACILITIES -- THEY WOULD

00:55:37.500 --> 00:55:40.370
BE PUT IN A SHOE FACILITY AND

00:55:40.437 --> 00:55:43.106
THEY'RE LIKE A SEGREGATED

00:55:43.173 --> 00:55:43.339
HOUSING.

00:55:43.406 --> 00:55:44.808
ISSUES.

00:55:44.874 --> 00:55:46.409
EN EN OF THESE DETENTION

00:55:46.476 --> 00:55:48.945
FACILITIES AND YOU KNOW LOCKED

00:55:49.012 --> 00:55:52.015
IN A SINGLE CELL WUSHU FACILITY.

00:55:52.082 --> 00:55:53.383
WHICH IS LIKE THE WORST THING

00:55:53.450 --> 00:55:56.586
YOU CAN DO FIRST.

00:55:56.653 --> 00:55:58.688
TRAUMA PSYCHOTIC BREAKDOWN

00:55:58.755 --> 00:56:00.223
HAPPENING YOU KNOW YOU SHOULD

00:56:00.290 --> 00:56:03.293
THAT SHOULD BE A MEDICAL ISSUE.

00:56:03.359 --> 00:56:03.893
TO TREAT HIM WITH THE MEDICAL

00:56:03.960 --> 00:56:04.794
CARE.

00:56:04.861 --> 00:56:06.930
SO SO I THINK THE I THINK WE

00:56:06.996 --> 00:56:08.231
NEED.

00:56:08.298 --> 00:56:11.901
HIGHERLEVELS OF INSPECTION AND

00:56:11.968 --> 00:56:15.605
ENFORCEMENT OF STATE LAWS.

00:56:15.672 --> 00:56:16.840
OUR REGARDING THOSE RESOURCES I

00:56:16.906 --> 00:56:17.874
WOULD LIKE TO HEAR.

00:56:17.941 --> 00:56:19.676
FROM YOU IN THE ADVICE OF WHAT

00:56:19.743 --> 00:56:22.178
FURTHER WE COULD DO IN THAT AREA

00:56:22.245 --> 00:56:23.279
IF YOU IF YOU.

00:56:23.346 --> 00:56:25.348
I THINK THE IT'S A VERY

00:56:25.415 --> 00:56:26.449
IMPORTANT CIVIL RIGHTS THING IT

00:56:26.516 --> 00:56:26.883
MIGHT.

00:56:26.950 --> 00:56:29.185
THE THE AUTHORITY YOU GAVE US TO

00:56:29.252 --> 00:56:30.620
CONTINUE DOING THE POTENTIAL

00:56:30.687 --> 00:56:32.689
WORK IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE

00:56:32.756 --> 00:56:34.257
PROBABLY THE THE THE THE MOST

00:56:34.324 --> 00:56:36.159
CRITICAL ASPECT OF THAT WORK IS

00:56:36.226 --> 00:56:37.761
THE FACT THAT.

00:56:37.827 --> 00:56:39.429
THESE CENTERS KNOW THAT.

00:56:39.496 --> 00:56:41.197
WE'RE GONNA GO IN AND INSPECT.

00:56:41.264 --> 00:56:43.433
AND IT.

00:56:43.500 --> 00:56:43.900
SUNSHINE IS THE BEST

00:56:43.967 --> 00:56:46.603
DISINFECTANT AND SO THE MORE

00:56:46.669 --> 00:56:48.004
THAT WERE ABLE TO ASK SOME LIGHT.

00:56:48.071 --> 00:56:49.773
ON THE CENTERS I THINK YOU'LL

00:56:49.839 --> 00:56:51.007
FIND THAT THE CENTERS WILL TO

00:56:51.074 --> 00:56:52.408
THE DEGREE THAT THEY HAVE EITHER

00:56:52.475 --> 00:56:57.580
CONTRACTS OR GOVERNMENTAL OF THE

00:56:57.647 --> 00:56:59.048
THIRTY TO DO THE DETENTION.

00:56:59.115 --> 00:57:00.083
THEN I I THINK WHAT YOU'LL FIND

00:57:00.150 --> 00:57:01.151
IS THAT THEY WOULD TRY TO DO THE

00:57:01.217 --> 00:57:02.318
BEST THEY CAN.

00:57:02.385 --> 00:57:04.621
WITH THE LAWS THAT REQUIRE THEM

00:57:04.687 --> 00:57:05.722
TO PRO PROVIDE SOME OF THOSE

00:57:05.789 --> 00:57:06.990
PROTECTIONS THAT YOU MENTION.

00:57:07.056 --> 00:57:08.091
AND SO I'D SAY THAT IF YOU

00:57:08.158 --> 00:57:10.360
CONTINUE TO JUST SUPPORT -- THE

00:57:10.426 --> 00:57:12.595
LEGISLATION THAT NOW IS LAW THAT

00:57:12.662 --> 00:57:14.364
ALLOWS US FOR THE NEXT TEN YEARS.

00:57:14.430 --> 00:57:15.932
TO DO THOSE INSPECTIONS THAT

00:57:15.999 --> 00:57:17.600
THAT WILL BE A GREAT WAY TO MAKE

00:57:17.667 --> 00:57:19.002
SURE THAT TO THE DEGREE THAT

00:57:19.068 --> 00:57:19.536
WE'RE GONNA HAVE DETENTION

00:57:19.602 --> 00:57:22.539
IMMIGRATION CIVIL IMMIGRATION

00:57:22.605 --> 00:57:23.673
DETENTION IN CALIFORNIA.

00:57:23.740 --> 00:57:24.607
AT LEAST WE KNOW THAT THE THE

00:57:24.674 --> 00:57:26.943
RIGHTS AND OF PEOPLE THAT ARE IN

00:57:27.010 --> 00:57:28.278
THOSE FACILITIES WILL BE

00:57:28.344 --> 00:57:30.113
PROTECTED AND THE CONDITIONS

00:57:30.180 --> 00:57:31.948
WILL BE WHAT ARE EXPECTED

00:57:32.015 --> 00:57:33.249
CALIFORNIA LAW.

00:57:33.316 --> 00:57:34.551

FACILITIES ARE TREATED.

00:58:02.946 --> 00:58:05.715
IN A MATTER CONSISTENT WITH

00:58:05.782 --> 00:58:08.017

MY READING THAT THAT YOU'RE NOT

01:00:38.634 --> 01:00:40.403
BEING COOPERATIVE WITH THIS

SUNSHINE OPPORTUNITY -- AND THIS

01:00:44.674 --> 01:00:46.743
IS AN IMPORTANT POINT.

01:00:46.809 --> 01:00:49.045
BECAUSE I THINK THE THE FACT

01:00:49.112 --> 01:00:50.780
THAT THE LEGISLATURE.

01:00:50.847 --> 01:00:52.648
ACHIEVE THIS MILESTONE TO PASS.

01:00:52.715 --> 01:00:54.384
THE THE LEGISLATION -- WAS WAS

01:00:54.450 --> 01:00:59.255
CRITICAL. TO THAT TRANSPARENCY.

01:00:59.322 --> 01:01:00.223
IN THE PROCESS OF PASSING THE

01:01:00.289 --> 01:01:04.193
LEGISLATION -- THE THE NEW THE

01:01:04.260 --> 01:01:10.266
NEW LAW NOW.

01:01:10.333 --> 01:01:12.101
CHANGES A REGIME WE HAD BEFORE

01:01:12.168 --> 01:01:13.403
WHERE SOME OF THE INFORMATION

01:01:13.469 --> 01:01:14.871
THAT WOULD NOW BE DISCLOSED.

01:01:14.937 --> 01:01:16.139
USED TO BE CONSIDERED PRIVATE

01:01:16.205 --> 01:01:18.174
INFORMATION.

01:01:18.241 --> 01:01:20.510
AND A QUESTION QUESTIONS BEGAN

01:01:20.576 --> 01:01:22.612
TO BE RAISED ABOUT WHETHER.

01:01:22.678 --> 01:01:24.580
THE THE LAW WOULD APPLY MOVING

01:01:24.647 --> 01:01:25.681
FORWARD FROM THE DATA BECAME

01:01:25.748 --> 01:01:27.250
EFFECTIVE.

01:01:27.316 --> 01:01:29.819
OR IF IT WOULD APPLY TO ALL DATA

01:01:29.886 --> 01:01:30.920
THAT'S BEING HELD INCLUDING

01:01:30.987 --> 01:01:33.389
PRIVATE DATA THAT PREVIOUSLY HAD

01:01:33.456 --> 01:01:35.058
PROTECTIONS UNDER LAW. FOR

01:01:35.124 --> 01:01:38.261
PRIVACY REASONS.

01:01:38.327 --> 01:01:39.929
I I'VE ALWAYS TAKEN THE POSITION

01:01:39.996 --> 01:01:42.765
THAT WHEN IT COMES TO PRIVACY.

01:01:42.832 --> 01:01:43.366
YOUR ONE CHANCE TO DO IT RIGHT

01:01:43.433 --> 01:01:43.666
[inaudible]

01:01:43.733 --> 01:01:48.137
IF YOU.

01:01:48.204 --> 01:01:50.373
AND FINE BUT IF YOU DISCO SO

01:01:50.440 --> 01:01:51.174
MUCH PRIVATE INFORMATION AND YOU

01:01:51.240 --> 01:01:52.408
WERE WRONG.

01:01:52.475 --> 01:01:53.943
YOU CAN'T UNRING THAT BELL.

01:01:54.010 --> 01:01:55.878
THAT PRIVATE INFORMATION IS NOW

01:01:55.945 --> 01:01:58.815
OUT THERE. FOR EVERYONE TO SEE

01:01:58.881 --> 01:01:59.916
AND YOU CANNOT SORT OF PULL IT

01:01:59.982 --> 01:02:01.350
BACK.

01:02:01.417 --> 01:02:03.286
AND SO BECAUSE THERE WERE

01:02:03.352 --> 01:02:06.989
CONFLICTING -- ACTIONS BY OUR

01:02:07.056 --> 01:02:09.759
COURTED TRYING TO INTERPRET --

01:02:09.826 --> 01:02:11.427

I WILL DO IT WE'RE READY TO

01:02:18.367 --> 01:02:19.202

COURTS SAY IN FACT WE ARE RIGHT

01:02:21.471 --> 01:02:23.473
NOW IN COURT ON A CASE IT

01:02:23.539 --> 01:02:24.040
APPLIES TO THE DEPARTMENT OF

01:02:24.107 --> 01:02:31.647
JUSTICE WHERE [inaudible]

01:02:31.714 --> 01:02:33.216
STATEMENT.

01:02:33.282 --> 01:02:35.585
THAT IF BELIEVE THAT THE

01:02:35.651 --> 01:02:38.721

01:02:40.256 --> 01:02:42.291
SO I I HAVE A FEELING WE SEE

01:02:42.358 --> 01:02:43.059
WHERE THE COURTS ARE GOING TO

01:02:43.126 --> 01:02:44.760

MERITS WILL BE PREPARED TO ACT

01:02:49.398 --> 01:02:51.000
BASED ON THAT MITCHELL DECISION --

01:02:51.067 --> 01:02:52.502
THERE BEEN A NUMBER OF CASES

01:02:52.568 --> 01:02:54.270
THAT HAVE COME UP.

01:02:54.337 --> 01:02:55.905
SEVERAL OF THEM HAVE SAID THE

01:02:55.972 --> 01:02:58.007
INFORMATION THREE TWENTY

01:02:58.074 --> 01:02:59.542
NINETEEN SHOULD BE DISCLOSED.

01:02:59.609 --> 01:03:00.176
THERE ARE A COUPLE OF SAID THAT

01:03:00.243 --> 01:03:02.678
ARE SAID TO HOLD OFF STILL AS WE

01:03:02.745 --> 01:03:04.080
GET CLOSER TO DISCUSSING THE

01:03:04.147 --> 01:03:05.481
MERITS OF THE CASE.

01:03:05.548 --> 01:03:07.550
I HOPE SOON THAT WILL HAVE A OF

01:03:07.617 --> 01:03:08.885
A RESOLUTION ON THE MERITS.

01:03:08.951 --> 01:03:11.120
SO THAT DAHLE AGENCIES WILL HAVE

01:03:11.187 --> 01:03:13.656
A SENSE OF HOW THEY COULD OF PUT

01:03:13.723 --> 01:03:14.657
FORWARD THIS INFORMATION.

01:03:14.724 --> 01:03:16.492
WE ARE FOR EXAMPLE IN THE

SACRAMENTO POLICE DEPARTMENT --

01:03:28.104 --> 01:03:29.472
IN THE SECOND POLICE DEPARTMENT

DURING IT THEIR INVESTIGATION OF

01:03:35.845 --> 01:03:38.181
THE SHOOTING -- BECAUSE WE WERE

01:03:38.247 --> 01:03:39.382
PART OF THAT I'VE MADE THE

01:03:39.448 --> 01:03:40.516
DECISION.

01:03:40.583 --> 01:03:41.851
AND I HAVE THE DISCRETION TO

01:03:41.918 --> 01:03:42.919
MAKE THAT DECISION TO DISCLOSE

01:03:42.985 --> 01:03:44.253
IN THAT PARTICULAR CASE OF THAT

01:03:44.320 --> 01:03:46.022
INVESTIGATION WE WILL DISCLOSE

01:03:46.088 --> 01:03:48.291
ALL RECORDS THAT WE HAVE WERE

01:03:48.357 --> 01:03:49.358

01:03:49.425 --> 01:03:52.929
INCLUDING THOSE THAT ARE PRE.

01:03:52.995 --> 01:03:53.563
TWENTY NINETEEN THANK YOU THANK

YOU MADAM CHAIR [inaudible]

01:03:55.131 --> 01:03:58.367
CERTAINLY.

01:03:58.434 --> 01:04:01.671
I WILL A TALK ABOUT THAT A

01:04:01.737 --> 01:04:02.638
LITTLE MORE BUT I WANTED TO

01:04:02.705 --> 01:04:03.973
RETURN.

01:04:04.040 --> 01:04:05.575
TO SEVEN BECAUSE THIS OPENING IS

01:04:05.641 --> 01:04:06.742
SORT OF THE OVERVIEW.

01:04:06.809 --> 01:04:13.416
AND WHAT I NOTE I RAISED IN MY

01:04:13.482 --> 01:04:15.117
COMMENTS IN CHANGING THE AGENDA

01:04:15.184 --> 01:04:17.720
THAT THERE'S ON THAT MANY OF THE

01:04:17.787 --> 01:04:20.122
BCP'S RE RECEIVED THIS YEAR.

01:04:20.189 --> 01:04:22.124
ARE ALL GENERAL FUND INCREASES

01:04:22.191 --> 01:04:23.426
NOW.

01:04:23.492 --> 01:04:26.495
YOUR DEPARTMENTS BUDGET WHICH IF

01:04:26.562 --> 01:04:28.464
WE WERE TO ACCEPT EVERYTHING

01:04:28.531 --> 01:04:30.333
THAT IS BEFORE US WOULD GO UP TO

01:04:30.399 --> 01:04:32.034
ABOUT A BILLION.

01:04:32.101 --> 01:04:33.536
IN THIS UPCOMING YEAR IT'S A

01:04:33.603 --> 01:04:35.071
MIXTURE OF GENERAL FUND AND

01:04:35.137 --> 01:04:37.707
SPECIAL FUNDS -- AND CERTAINLY

01:04:37.773 --> 01:04:39.675
THE LEGISLATURE HAS PASSED LAWS

01:04:39.742 --> 01:04:41.277
THAT TO INCREASE YOUR WORKLOAD.

01:04:41.344 --> 01:04:43.145
BUT INTERESTINGLY WE HAVE ALSO

01:04:43.212 --> 01:04:44.747
PASSED MANY LAWS THAT WOULD

01:04:44.814 --> 01:04:46.816
DECREASE YOUR WORKLOAD AND YET

01:04:46.882 --> 01:04:48.351
WHAT THE PATTERN THAT I SEE.

01:04:48.417 --> 01:04:51.220
IS NOT BCP'S DIRECT KNOWLEDGE

01:04:51.287 --> 01:04:53.556
THE DECREASE IN WORKLOAD BUT

01:04:53.623 --> 01:04:55.458
RATHER CONTINUAL ONGOING

01:04:55.524 --> 01:04:57.026
ASSUMPTIONS OF INCREASING

01:04:57.093 --> 01:04:57.927
WORKLOAD.

01:04:57.994 --> 01:05:00.997
AND WHAT I NOTE FOR EXAMPLE IS

01:05:01.063 --> 01:05:02.298
THE PERIOD.

01:05:02.365 --> 01:05:03.065
FROM.

01:05:03.132 --> 01:05:05.701
THE SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN BUDGET TO

01:05:05.768 --> 01:05:07.803
THE EIGHTEEN NINETEEN WAS A

01:05:07.870 --> 01:05:09.138
SIXTY MILLION DOLLAR GENERAL

01:05:09.205 --> 01:05:10.273
FUND INCREASE.

01:05:10.339 --> 01:05:13.609
SO ISN'T THE MOST SUBSTANTIAL

01:05:13.676 --> 01:05:14.677
GENERAL FUND INCREASE SINCE.

01:05:14.744 --> 01:05:17.313
OVER A DECADE AND THEN BE

01:05:17.380 --> 01:05:19.215
INCREASE THAT'S BEING ASKED THIS

01:05:19.282 --> 01:05:20.783
YEAR FOR CHEN JUST GENERAL FUND

01:05:20.850 --> 01:05:22.618
WE'RE NOT TALKING ALL THE OTHER

01:05:22.685 --> 01:05:24.120
SPECIAL FUNDS.

01:05:24.186 --> 01:05:26.756
IS THIRTY SEVEN MILLION SO NOT

01:05:26.822 --> 01:05:28.824
AS SIGNIFICANT AS THE SIXTY BUT

01:05:28.891 --> 01:05:31.427
WHEN WE LOOK AT ALL OF THE OTHER

01:05:31.494 --> 01:05:33.629
THINGS THAT IF IF I LOOK FOR

01:05:33.696 --> 01:05:34.497
EXAMPLE.

01:05:34.563 --> 01:05:36.666
THE GOVERNOR IN HIS PRESENTATION

01:05:36.732 --> 01:05:38.668
OF A BUDGET RAISES THE ISSUE

01:05:38.734 --> 01:05:41.871
THAT WE SHOULD HAVE -- FAR MORE

01:05:41.937 --> 01:05:43.906
UNIVERSAL EARLY CARE AND

01:05:43.973 --> 01:05:46.275
EDUCATION FOR OUR ZERO TO FOUR

01:05:46.342 --> 01:05:47.009
KIDS.

01:05:47.076 --> 01:05:48.744
NOW THE GOVERNOR DID NOT PROPOSE

01:05:48.811 --> 01:05:50.746
IN THE BUDGET FINDING THAT WOULD

01:05:50.813 --> 01:05:52.381
ENABLE THE STATE TO DO IT BUT

01:05:52.448 --> 01:05:54.417
THE FUNDING THAT HE ID PROPOSE

01:05:54.483 --> 01:05:56.252
TO BEGIN TO EXPAND THAT WERE ALL

01:05:56.319 --> 01:05:57.153
ONE TIME ONLY.

01:05:57.219 --> 01:05:59.789
AND HE DID THAT BECAUSE IN LEAST

01:05:59.855 --> 01:06:02.825
IN HIS ARGUMENT THAT WE HE

01:06:02.892 --> 01:06:04.593
COULDN'T PROJECT THAT WE WOULD

01:06:04.660 --> 01:06:06.062
HAVE ON GOING REVENUES TO

01:06:06.128 --> 01:06:07.496
JUSTIFY.

01:06:07.563 --> 01:06:11.634
THE ON GOING EXPENSE.

01:06:11.701 --> 01:06:13.669
SO WHY I RECESSES BECAUSE EVERY

01:06:13.736 --> 01:06:15.538
DOLLAR SPENT IN GENERAL FUND --

01:06:15.604 --> 01:06:16.472
WE SPEND WE AUTHORIZED IN

01:06:16.539 --> 01:06:17.573
GENERAL IS COMPETING WITH

01:06:17.640 --> 01:06:20.076
AGAINST EVERY OTHER GENERAL FUND.

01:06:20.142 --> 01:06:22.611
EXPENDITURE AND SO WHEN I LOOK

01:06:22.678 --> 01:06:24.246
AT THAT TOTAL.

01:06:24.313 --> 01:06:26.148
AND I LOOK AT LAWS THAT WE ALSO

01:06:26.215 --> 01:06:29.852
PASSED THAT REDUCED WORKLOAD --

01:06:29.919 --> 01:06:32.054
I I DON'T SEE -- I DON'T SEE THE

01:06:32.121 --> 01:06:34.123
SAME RECONCILIATION FROM THE

01:06:34.190 --> 01:06:37.393
AG'S OFFICE.

01:06:37.460 --> 01:06:38.928
ROGER I'M -- INTERESTED IN

01:06:38.994 --> 01:06:39.995
LEARNING WHERE YOU THINK THAT

01:06:40.062 --> 01:06:41.330
OUR WORKLOAD HAS GONE DOWN

01:06:41.397 --> 01:06:43.766
BECAUSE THE SEX OFFENDER WILL

01:06:43.833 --> 01:06:45.101
MAKE YOUR WORKLOAD GO DOWN.

01:06:45.167 --> 01:06:46.869
AND MAYBE IN A FEW YEARS BUT NOT

01:06:46.936 --> 01:06:48.838
RIGHT NOW KNOWN WE GAVE YOU TEN

01:06:48.904 --> 01:06:51.107
MILLION LAST YEAR AND POSITIONS

01:06:51.173 --> 01:06:52.908
TO ASSIST THAT AND CERTAINLY IT

01:06:52.975 --> 01:06:54.543
MAY NOT HAVE BEEN ADEQUATE.

01:06:54.610 --> 01:06:56.512
BUT IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE THAT

01:06:56.579 --> 01:06:59.915
ANOTHER SEVENTEEN MILLION IN

01:06:59.982 --> 01:07:01.584
THIRTY SEVEN F. T. E. ON GOING

01:07:01.650 --> 01:07:03.819
NOT ONE TIME WOULD BE NEEDED

01:07:03.886 --> 01:07:05.588
GIVEN THAT AS YOU POINTED OUT

01:07:05.654 --> 01:07:07.823
THE WORKLOAD WILL GO DOWN OVER

01:07:07.890 --> 01:07:08.424
TIME.

01:07:08.491 --> 01:07:09.759
VENTURE LIBYA AMID ASK CHRIS

01:07:09.825 --> 01:07:11.060
RYAN WHOSE WE I DON'T WANT TO GO

01:07:11.127 --> 01:07:12.328
IN TO GET INTO THAT WHEN IN

01:07:12.395 --> 01:07:14.730
GREAT DETAIL THIS IS A OVERVIEW.

01:07:14.797 --> 01:07:15.498
OKAY BUT I I I SHOULD HAVE A

01:07:15.564 --> 01:07:16.665
SENIOR JUST IN CASE I SEE

01:07:16.732 --> 01:07:18.901
SOMETHING THAT'S NOT CORRECT --

01:07:18.968 --> 01:07:19.969
BECAUSE HE'S A HEAD OF OUR OUR

01:07:20.035 --> 01:07:21.103
OUR BUDGET IS HEAD OF OUR

01:07:21.170 --> 01:07:23.305
OPERATIONS DIVISION BUT ALSO --

01:07:23.372 --> 01:07:24.607
IS VERY FAMILIAR WITH THE BUDGET.

01:07:24.673 --> 01:07:26.776
WHAT I'LL TELL YOU WITH REGARD

01:07:26.842 --> 01:07:28.344
TO THE SEXUAL OFFENDER MATTER?

01:07:28.411 --> 01:07:30.846
BECAUSE THE TEARING SYSTEM IS

01:07:30.913 --> 01:07:32.681
ONE WHERE WE CANNOT GET IT WRONG.

01:07:32.748 --> 01:07:34.483
IF WE MISS CLASSIFY.

01:07:34.550 --> 01:07:37.052
A AND OFFENDER AS OF LESS.

01:07:37.119 --> 01:07:38.554
SERIOUS OF AN OFFENDER THAN WHAT

01:07:38.621 --> 01:07:41.424
HE OR SHE MAY TRULY BE AND AS A

01:07:41.490 --> 01:07:45.661
RESULT THAT PERSON IS REMOVED

01:07:45.728 --> 01:07:46.962
FROM.

01:07:47.029 --> 01:07:49.398
IDENTIFY LESS.

01:07:49.465 --> 01:07:50.933
WITH NO ONE WANTS TO TAKE THE

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.002
THE THE THE CHURCH WE MAKE THE

01:07:53.068 --> 01:07:54.270
WRONG DECISION.

01:07:54.336 --> 01:07:54.870
AND SO BECAUSE THIS IS A TOTAL

01:07:54.937 --> 01:07:56.639
CHANGE IN THE WAY WE CLASSIFY.

01:07:56.705 --> 01:07:57.239
WE TALKED ABOUT WHAT IT WOULD

01:07:57.306 --> 01:07:58.007
TAKE TO GET IT DONE IN THE TIME

01:07:58.073 --> 01:07:59.341
FRAME THAT WAS CALLED FOR BY THE

01:07:59.408 --> 01:08:00.009
LEGISLATURE.

01:08:00.075 --> 01:08:01.177
CHRIS CAN GET INTO THE DETAILS

01:08:01.243 --> 01:08:02.745
AT SOME POINT LATER IF YOU LIKE

01:08:02.812 --> 01:08:05.948
BUT WHAT WE ASK FOR WAS JUST SO

01:08:06.015 --> 01:08:07.082
THAT WE COULD MEET.

01:08:07.149 --> 01:08:09.518
THE PHARMACIST OR OR THE REQUEST

01:08:09.585 --> 01:08:11.086
THAT WERE MADE IN THE

01:08:11.153 --> 01:08:13.889
LEGISLATION FOR US TO BE TO MEET.

01:08:13.956 --> 01:08:15.291
THAT SEX OFFENDER TEARING

01:08:15.357 --> 01:08:16.459
PROCESS.

01:08:16.525 --> 01:08:17.593
WHICH IS A GREAT GREAT THING TO

01:08:17.660 --> 01:08:19.395
DO BECAUSE SOMEONE WHO IS A VERY

01:08:19.462 --> 01:08:21.063
LOW LEVEL OFFENDER HAS BEEN A

01:08:21.130 --> 01:08:21.564
LONG TIME COULD NOT BE

01:08:21.630 --> 01:08:22.531
CLASSIFIED.

01:08:22.598 --> 01:08:23.933
WITH THE WORST THE WORST.

01:08:23.999 --> 01:08:25.000
IT'S JUST THAT WE CANNOT MAKE A

01:08:25.067 --> 01:08:25.868
MISTAKE.

01:08:25.935 --> 01:08:27.603
AND SO WE'RE WHAT WE DID WAS WE

01:08:27.670 --> 01:08:29.138
AT THANK YOU VERY MUCH BECAUSE

01:08:29.205 --> 01:08:30.606
YOU GAVE US A CHANCE TO REALLY

01:08:30.673 --> 01:08:31.440
DO IT THE RIGHT WAY.

01:08:31.507 --> 01:08:33.542
BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT IS TO BE

01:08:33.609 --> 01:08:35.077
ASKED TO DO SOMETHING AND THEN

01:08:35.144 --> 01:08:36.879
NOT BE ABLE TO DELIVER.

01:08:36.946 --> 01:08:38.948
WHEN YOU BASS?

01:08:39.014 --> 01:08:40.149
BUT I WE CAN I DON'T WANT T GO

01:08:40.216 --> 01:08:41.183
INTO MORE DETAIL ON IT NOW

01:08:41.250 --> 01:08:42.985
BECAUSE MY STAFF WILL HAVE LOTS

01:08:43.052 --> 01:08:44.153
OF QUESTIONS FOR YOU WHICH YOU

01:08:44.220 --> 01:08:45.721
CAN THEN WE CAN GO INTO DETAIL

01:08:45.788 --> 01:08:47.156
ON IT LATER BUT CERTAINLY

01:08:47.223 --> 01:08:48.858
APPRECIATE NONE OF US WANT TO

01:08:48.924 --> 01:08:49.391
HAVE.

01:08:49.458 --> 01:08:52.695
ANYBODY WRONGLY PUT ON A TWO

01:08:52.761 --> 01:08:53.829
YEAR.

01:08:53.896 --> 01:08:54.463
IT'S HARD TO SEE WHY WE WOULD

01:08:54.530 --> 01:08:56.832
NEED THIRTY SEVEN NEW F. T. E.

01:08:56.899 --> 01:08:58.567
ON TOP OF THE F. T. EITHER WE

01:08:58.634 --> 01:09:00.035
GRANTED TO ACHIEVE THAT.

01:09:00.102 --> 01:09:02.071
WHEN THEY'RE SAID NO MORE THAN

01:09:02.137 --> 01:09:04.006
FOR ABOUT FIVE THOUSAND SIX

01:09:04.073 --> 01:09:05.774
VENDORS ADDED PER YEAR BUT WE

01:09:05.841 --> 01:09:08.010
WILL GET INTO THAT DETAIL LATER?

01:09:08.077 --> 01:09:10.079
WE'RE GOING TO SOME OTHER ISSUES --

01:09:10.145 --> 01:09:11.247
AND WE'LL GET MORE INTO THIS IN

01:09:11.313 --> 01:09:12.948
THE APPS DISCUSSION BUT FOR

01:09:13.015 --> 01:09:14.950
EXAMPLE SENATOR MORE LOCK RAISED.

01:09:15.017 --> 01:09:16.252
THE ISSUE AROUND THE LOCAL

01:09:16.318 --> 01:09:19.622
AGENCIES.

01:09:19.688 --> 01:09:21.056
AND YOUR RESPONSE WAS YES IN

01:09:21.123 --> 01:09:23.058
MANY CASES ARE LOCAL AGENCIES

01:09:23.125 --> 01:09:24.727
LAW ENFORCEMENT FOLKS ARE PAID

01:09:24.793 --> 01:09:26.161
BETTER THAN OUR STATE.

01:09:26.228 --> 01:09:28.063
ON IN JUST STEPPING BACK MY

01:09:28.130 --> 01:09:29.331
POINT ABOUT THE COLLECTIVE

01:09:29.398 --> 01:09:31.233
BARGAINING THING WAS MORE THAT

01:09:31.300 --> 01:09:32.101
IT WAS.

01:09:32.167 --> 01:09:34.236
IT FELT TO ME LIKE WE WERE

01:09:34.303 --> 01:09:36.572
DESCRIBING OURSELVES AS A VICTIM

01:09:36.639 --> 01:09:38.474
OF SOMETHING VERSES OF SOMETHING

01:09:38.541 --> 01:09:39.775
THAT WE HAVE A LITTLE MORE

01:09:39.842 --> 01:09:41.377
INFLUENCE OVER.

01:09:41.443 --> 01:09:44.513
CERTAINLY SO THAT THAT WAS WHY I

01:09:44.580 --> 01:09:45.748
INTERVENED IN THAT LINE OF

01:09:45.814 --> 01:09:47.216
QUESTIONING JUST BECAUSE WAIT A

01:09:47.283 --> 01:09:48.450
MINUTE WE'RE NOT IT'S THIS IS

01:09:48.517 --> 01:09:49.585
NOT JUST.

01:09:49.652 --> 01:09:51.220
THROWN DOWN ON US WE HAVE THERE

01:09:51.287 --> 01:09:53.422
IS A ROLE WE HAVE BEEN IF WE

01:09:53.489 --> 01:09:55.090
FEEL THAT.

01:09:55.157 --> 01:09:57.793
THE AGREEMENT THAT WE'VE MADE

01:09:57.860 --> 01:10:00.162
WITH THE SET OF STAFF THAT ARE

01:10:00.229 --> 01:10:02.164
FULFILLING AN OBLIGATION WE FEEL

01:10:02.231 --> 01:10:05.301
WE HAVE AND IT'S NOT ADEQUATE.

01:10:05.367 --> 01:10:07.703
FOR IS NOT ADEQUATE COMPENSATION

01:10:07.770 --> 01:10:09.238
TO RETAIN THE POSITIONS THAT

01:10:09.305 --> 01:10:11.073
THAT SHOULD BE BROUGHT TO THE

01:10:11.140 --> 01:10:12.875
ATTENTION BUT THAT SITE THAT'S

01:10:12.942 --> 01:10:14.643
WHY RAISE THAT BECAUSE CLEARLY

01:10:14.710 --> 01:10:16.879
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT IS

01:10:16.946 --> 01:10:18.514
SOMEWHAT FIXABLE.

01:10:18.581 --> 01:10:18.981
NOW.

01:10:19.048 --> 01:10:21.951
ON THE ISSUE OF LOCAL LAW

01:10:22.017 --> 01:10:22.518
ENFORCEMENT.

01:10:22.585 --> 01:10:24.253
BEING PAID BETTER THAN MANY OF

01:10:24.320 --> 01:10:25.187
OUR STATE.

01:10:25.254 --> 01:10:27.056
LAW ENFORCEMENT THIS IS TRUE

01:10:27.122 --> 01:10:29.525
HOWEVER.

01:10:29.592 --> 01:10:31.760
LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT.

01:10:31.827 --> 01:10:33.562
IN MANY PLACES SEVEN ELM STREET

01:10:33.629 --> 01:10:37.199
IS ALREADY.

01:10:37.266 --> 01:10:39.835
JOINING IN IN ENFORCING THE APPS.

01:10:39.902 --> 01:10:40.336
NOW.

01:10:40.402 --> 01:10:43.606
IF WE MANDATE THAT THEY DO.

01:10:43.672 --> 01:10:45.441
YES WE HAVE TO FULLY COVER THE

01:10:45.507 --> 01:10:46.175
COSTS [inaudible]

01:10:46.241 --> 01:10:47.943
WHAT [inaudible]

01:10:48.010 --> 01:10:51.714
IF WE ENGAGE IN COOPERATION WITH

01:10:51.780 --> 01:10:53.515
THOSE AGENCIES THAT ARE MORE

01:10:53.582 --> 01:10:55.384
THAN WILLING.

01:10:55.451 --> 01:10:57.853
TO AND CLEARLY IN OUR MATERIALS

01:10:57.920 --> 01:10:59.321
IT EVEN DESCRIBES HOW MUCH

01:10:59.388 --> 01:11:00.756
TRAINING AND ALL.

01:11:00.823 --> 01:11:02.925
THE YOUR OFFICE HAS DONE WITH

01:11:02.992 --> 01:11:04.460
DIFFERENT LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT

01:11:04.526 --> 01:11:07.896
AGENCIES TO EQUIP THEM TO DO SO.

01:11:07.963 --> 01:11:11.467
AND ON ANY YET WHEN DATE HAVE

01:11:11.533 --> 01:11:14.103
BEEN DONE SIGN DONE SO.

01:11:14.169 --> 01:11:17.172
WE HAVE NOT COVERED THEIR COSTS

01:11:17.239 --> 01:11:19.074
WE'VE COVERED THE TRAINING OF IT.

01:11:19.141 --> 01:11:20.743
AND WE CERTAINLY COVER YOUR

01:11:20.809 --> 01:11:22.378
COSTS FOR UPDATING.

01:11:22.444 --> 01:11:24.179
THE APPS WHEN THEY RETRIEVE THE

01:11:24.246 --> 01:11:25.614
WEAPON BUT WE'VE NOT.

01:11:25.681 --> 01:11:28.317
REIMBURSE THE AGENCY.

01:11:28.384 --> 01:11:29.485
FOR BECAUSE WE DON'T NEED TO

01:11:29.551 --> 01:11:31.754
UNLESS WE EITHER MANDATED OR

01:11:31.820 --> 01:11:33.355
DIRECTLY CONTRACT WITH THEM TO

01:11:33.422 --> 01:11:34.490
DO SO.

01:11:34.556 --> 01:11:35.758
SO I THINK THAT.

01:11:35.824 --> 01:11:37.960
WHAT?

01:11:38.027 --> 01:11:40.029
MANY OF US AND WE CAN GET INTO

01:11:40.095 --> 01:11:41.430
MORE DETAIL WE JUST DISCUSSED

01:11:41.497 --> 01:11:45.134
THIS IN THE THE NEXT I AM BUT I

01:11:45.200 --> 01:11:45.701
THINK ROOM.

01:11:45.768 --> 01:11:48.203
WHAT MANY OF US ARE IN YOU MADE

01:11:48.270 --> 01:11:51.040
THE POINT THAT [inaudible]

01:11:51.106 --> 01:11:53.042
DEAR J..

01:11:53.108 --> 01:11:56.445
IS BY ITS NATURE A CERTAIN SIZE.

01:11:56.512 --> 01:11:59.014
WE DO HAVE A VERY LARGE STATE IS

01:11:59.081 --> 01:12:02.017
VERY DIFFICULT TO IMAGINE THAT

01:12:02.084 --> 01:12:04.486
WE WOULD BE ABLE TO HAVE.

01:12:04.553 --> 01:12:07.222
PRESENCE OF DOJ LAW ENFORCEMENT

01:12:07.289 --> 01:12:10.125
IN SUCH NUMBERS ACROSS THE STATE

01:12:10.192 --> 01:12:11.994
TO BE ABLE.

01:12:12.061 --> 01:12:13.595
TO ADEQUATELY HIT ALL THE G.

01:12:13.662 --> 01:12:15.164
WERE HUGE STATE.

01:12:15.230 --> 01:12:18.667
I'M FOR THAT ENFORCEMENT OF APPS.

01:12:18.734 --> 01:12:20.569
WHEREAS WE KNOW WE HAVE LOCAL

01:12:20.636 --> 01:12:21.470
LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES

01:12:21.537 --> 01:12:23.338
EVERYWHERE.

01:12:23.405 --> 01:12:25.340
AND SO THE MORE THAT THEY ARE

01:12:25.407 --> 01:12:27.176
WILLING TO ENGAGE IN THE MORE WE

01:12:27.242 --> 01:12:29.645
CAN ENCOURAGE THEM TO DO SO.

01:12:29.712 --> 01:12:31.880
THE BETTER BECAUSE IT HELPS

01:12:31.947 --> 01:12:34.216
ENSURE THAT OUR OBJECTIVES IN

01:12:34.283 --> 01:12:36.618
GETTING -- WEAPONS OUT OF THE

01:12:36.685 --> 01:12:38.654
HANDS OF THOSE PEOPLE ON THE

01:12:38.721 --> 01:12:40.756
PROHIBITED PERSONS LAST.

01:12:40.823 --> 01:12:42.758
ON SO I THINK.

01:12:42.825 --> 01:12:45.194
AND I AM NOT TOO DON'T WANT --

01:12:45.260 --> 01:12:46.595
TO INTERPRETER SPEAK FOR MY A

01:12:46.662 --> 01:12:47.896
COLLEAGUE ON THE DICE BUT I

01:12:47.963 --> 01:12:49.531
THINK THAT FOR MANY OF US WE

01:12:49.598 --> 01:12:50.733
WANT TO SEE.

01:12:50.799 --> 01:12:53.402
MORE OF THAT ENGAGEMENT.

01:12:53.469 --> 01:12:55.637
AND WE ARE WHERE THERE MAY BE

01:12:55.704 --> 01:12:57.072
SOME LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES

01:12:57.139 --> 01:12:59.775
LOCAL THAT REALLY DON'T WANT.

01:12:59.842 --> 01:13:01.076
TO BUT THERE ARE MANY THAT HAVE

01:13:01.143 --> 01:13:03.645
EXPRESSED THEY REALLY DO WANT

01:13:03.712 --> 01:13:03.946
[inaudible]

01:13:04.012 --> 01:13:05.981
TO AND SO.

01:13:06.048 --> 01:13:07.249
THE END BECAUSE THEY SEE IT AS

01:13:07.316 --> 01:13:08.984
VERY IMPORTANT FOR THE PUBLIC

01:13:09.051 --> 01:13:10.753
SAFETY OF THEIR COMMUNITIES.

01:13:10.819 --> 01:13:12.821
SO WE REALLY WANT TO SEE THAT.

01:13:12.888 --> 01:13:15.290
AND THAT'S NOT TO SAY THAT THERE

01:13:15.357 --> 01:13:18.060
MAY NOT BE LEGITIMATE INCREASES

01:13:18.127 --> 01:13:18.994
THAT.

01:13:19.061 --> 01:13:21.830
THE DOJ MAY NEED FOR THE

01:13:21.897 --> 01:13:23.932
IMPLEMENTATION BUT CERTAINLY I

01:13:23.999 --> 01:13:26.502
WOULD NOT I CANNOT ENTERTAIN.

01:13:26.568 --> 01:13:28.670
TRYING TO INCREASE DOJ TO THE

01:13:28.737 --> 01:13:30.239
POINT WHERE IT WOULD ACTUALLY

01:13:30.305 --> 01:13:33.342
HAVE ADEQUATE STAFFING CAPACITY

01:13:33.408 --> 01:13:36.078
TO COVER THIS ENTIRE STATE.

01:13:36.145 --> 01:13:37.679
JUST BECAUSE THE NATURE OF THE

01:13:37.746 --> 01:13:39.214
MANAGER THE THE REQUESTED

01:13:39.281 --> 01:13:41.116
FUNDING WHICH OF THE GOVERNOR --

01:13:41.183 --> 01:13:44.319
INCLUDED IN THIS BUDGET DOES NOT --

01:13:44.386 --> 01:13:45.654
TAKE US TO THE POINT WHERE WE

01:13:45.721 --> 01:13:47.823
COULD COVER THE ENTIRE STATE.

01:13:47.890 --> 01:13:49.291
IT'S SIMPLY RIGHTS THIS EXPAND

01:13:49.358 --> 01:13:51.026
TO TRY TO ADDRESS THE FACT THAT

01:13:51.093 --> 01:13:51.927
THERE ARE MORE PEOPLE COMING

01:13:51.994 --> 01:13:53.529
INTO THE SYSTEM.

01:13:53.595 --> 01:13:56.832
THEN WE CAN COVER AND SO -- WE

01:13:56.899 --> 01:13:58.267
ARE.

01:13:58.333 --> 01:13:59.601
FOR FAR FROM GETTING ANYWHERE

01:13:59.668 --> 01:14:01.069
CLOSE TO BEING ABLE TO TRULY

01:14:01.136 --> 01:14:03.071
COVER THE ENTIRE STATE.

01:14:03.138 --> 01:14:05.607
BUT I CAN -- AGREE COMPLETELY

01:14:05.674 --> 01:14:07.709
THAT WE COULD -- WORK CLOSER

01:14:07.776 --> 01:14:09.444
WITH LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT WE

01:14:09.511 --> 01:14:10.379
ARE GOING TO HAVE TO IN SENT

01:14:10.445 --> 01:14:12.147
THEM TO WANT TO PARTICIPATE

01:14:12.214 --> 01:14:14.316
BECAUSE THEY CAN ALREADY DO IT

01:14:14.383 --> 01:14:15.284
AS YOU'VE MENTIONED IT IS I'VE

01:14:15.350 --> 01:14:16.585
AND MANY HAVE.

01:14:16.652 --> 01:14:17.653
MANY HAVE.

01:14:17.719 --> 01:14:19.822
IN LIMITED WAYS.

01:14:19.888 --> 01:14:21.490
IN VERY LIMITED WAYS.

01:14:21.557 --> 01:14:23.826
LA COUNTY FOR EXAMPLE IS A IS

01:14:23.892 --> 01:14:24.560
ONE OF THOSE COUNTIES ONE OF

01:14:24.626 --> 01:14:26.228
THOSE LOCATIONS THAT REALLY DOES

01:14:26.295 --> 01:14:27.696
WANT TO DO THIS BECAUSE IT JUST

01:14:27.763 --> 01:14:28.764
SO HAPPENS THAT LA COUNTY HAS

01:14:28.831 --> 01:14:30.933
THE MOST NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO

01:14:30.999 --> 01:14:32.434
ARE ON THE APPS SYSTEM.

01:14:32.501 --> 01:14:33.735
AND THEY KNOW WHAT IT MEANS FOR

01:14:33.802 --> 01:14:34.803
THEM IF THEY'RE THESE FOLKS ARE

01:14:34.870 --> 01:14:37.005
ROAMING THE STREETS SO THEY WANT

01:14:37.072 --> 01:14:38.707
TO WORK CLOSE TO THAT.

01:14:38.774 --> 01:14:40.776
BUT I COULD GIVE YOU THE EXAMPLE

01:14:40.843 --> 01:14:42.411
OF A CASE IN RIVERSIDE.

01:14:42.477 --> 01:14:44.513
OF AN INDIVIDUAL WHO RESIDED IN

01:14:44.580 --> 01:14:46.348
RIVERSIDE WHO WAS ON THE APPS

01:14:46.415 --> 01:14:47.182
SYSTEM.

01:14:47.249 --> 01:14:49.785
SO WE WE HAD THE AUTHORITY TO GO.

01:14:49.852 --> 01:14:51.687
RETRIEVE WEAPONS WE FOUND OUT

01:14:51.753 --> 01:14:53.355
THAT THE WEAPONS THAT THAT

01:14:53.422 --> 01:14:55.257
INDIVIDUAL SAID -- THAT HE

01:14:55.324 --> 01:14:56.658
POSSESSED.

01:14:56.725 --> 01:14:57.693
HE SAID HAT THEY WERE NO LONGER

01:14:57.759 --> 01:14:59.394
IN THE COUNTY RIVERSIDE THEY

01:14:59.461 --> 01:15:02.931
WERE WITH -- RELATIVES OR

01:15:02.998 --> 01:15:04.299
FRIENDS SOMEWHERE ELSE.

01:15:04.366 --> 01:15:05.100
RIVERSIDE COUNTY SHERIFF'S MIGHT

01:15:05.167 --> 01:15:06.301
WANT TO WORK WITH US.

01:15:06.368 --> 01:15:07.536
BUT THE MOMENT THEY HAVE TO GO

01:15:07.603 --> 01:15:08.437
OUTSIDE RIVERSIDE THEY LOSE ALL

01:15:08.503 --> 01:15:09.872
JURISDICTION.

01:15:09.938 --> 01:15:11.573
AND SO THEY COULD WORK THIS CASE

01:15:11.640 --> 01:15:13.542
THE WAY OUR OUR OUR AGE DID ALL

01:15:13.609 --> 01:15:14.910
THE WAY THROUGH BECAUSE IT TAKES

01:15:14.977 --> 01:15:16.745
WEEKS TO WORK THESE CASES.

01:15:16.812 --> 01:15:17.346
BUT THEY HAVE TO STOP AT THE

01:15:17.412 --> 01:15:18.180
BORDER.

01:15:18.247 --> 01:15:19.581
AND THEY WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO GO

01:15:19.648 --> 01:15:20.582
OVER CRISIS TO GET -- GET THOSE

01:15:20.649 --> 01:15:23.018
WEAPONS.

01:15:23.085 --> 01:15:23.585
WE DON'T HAVE THAT WORRY WE

01:15:23.652 --> 01:15:25.153
CAN'T BUT WHAT WE SHOULD DO IS

01:15:25.220 --> 01:15:26.622
NOT TRY TO DO ALL THE WORK THAT

01:15:26.688 --> 01:15:28.390
RIVERSIDE OR LA COUNTY WOULD

01:15:28.457 --> 01:15:30.592
WANT TO DO FOR US WITH US.

01:15:30.659 --> 01:15:31.660
WHAT WE SHOULD DO IS?

01:15:31.727 --> 01:15:33.395
HAVE A NETWORK THAT WORKS

01:15:33.462 --> 01:15:35.063
TOGETHER SO IF RIVERSIDE IS

01:15:35.130 --> 01:15:36.465
GONNA DO SOME OF THE APPS

01:15:36.531 --> 01:15:37.532
RETRIEVAL.

01:15:37.599 --> 01:15:38.967
AND THEY'RE GONNA HAVE.

01:15:39.034 --> 01:15:40.235
TO GET SOMEONE WHO'S NOW

01:15:40.302 --> 01:15:41.770
CHRISTER COUNTY BORDER.

01:15:41.837 --> 01:15:43.405
THEY HAVE A RELATIONSHIP THROUGH

01:15:43.472 --> 01:15:44.840
ARE WORKING WITH THEM TASK

01:15:44.907 --> 01:15:47.109
FORCES FOR EXAMPLE SO THAT

01:15:47.175 --> 01:15:48.043
THERE'S NO DELAY.

01:15:48.110 --> 01:15:49.711
WE HAD A SITUATION UP IN THE BAY

01:15:49.778 --> 01:15:52.281
AREA WHERE AGAIN THE INDIVIDUAL

01:15:52.347 --> 01:15:54.182
WEEK WE HAD THE INDIVIDUAL MAKE

01:15:54.249 --> 01:15:55.951
CONTACT THE INDIVIDUAL SAID THE

01:15:56.018 --> 01:15:57.452
WEAPONS WITH MY SISTER WHERE'S

01:15:57.519 --> 01:15:58.020
YOUR SISTER.

01:15:58.086 --> 01:15:59.721
IN ANOTHER CITY WAS IN A

01:15:59.788 --> 01:16:00.856
DIFFERENT COUNTY.

01:16:00.923 --> 01:16:02.391
BECAUSE THERE WAS NO ARRANGEMENT

01:16:02.457 --> 01:16:04.359
WE HAD A WAIT.

01:16:04.426 --> 01:16:05.928
TELL OUR AGENTS DROVE ALL THE

01:16:05.994 --> 01:16:08.363
WAY IN THE BAY AREA WITH TRAFFIC

01:16:08.430 --> 01:16:10.098
TO GO TO THAT CITY THE GOAL

01:16:10.165 --> 01:16:11.667
LOCATE THE SISTERTO SEE IF WE

01:16:11.733 --> 01:16:13.402
GET THE WEAPON.

01:16:13.468 --> 01:16:14.036
AND AND SO.

01:16:14.102 --> 01:16:15.871
IT IF WE COULD HAVE A

01:16:15.938 --> 01:16:16.538
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE CITY WHERE

01:16:16.605 --> 01:16:17.406
THAT.

01:16:17.472 --> 01:16:20.375
SISTER WAS LOCATED SAY CAN YOU

01:16:20.442 --> 01:16:21.944
SEND SOME OFFICERS OUT THERE.

01:16:22.010 --> 01:16:22.978
AT THAT POINT I THINK IT'S

01:16:23.045 --> 01:16:24.346
LEGITIMATE FOR THAT AGE TO SAY

01:16:24.413 --> 01:16:25.714
WE WANT THAT RELATIONSHIP

01:16:25.781 --> 01:16:27.082
BECAUSE WE WANT TO GET THAT

01:16:27.149 --> 01:16:27.749
WEAPON.

01:16:27.816 --> 01:16:28.417
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT PULL OUR

01:16:28.483 --> 01:16:29.418
OFFICERS WERERIGHT NOW DOING

01:16:29.484 --> 01:16:31.553
PATROLLING TO GET THAT WEAPON

01:16:31.620 --> 01:16:32.454
IT'S GOING TO MOVE THE BOY FROM

01:16:32.521 --> 01:16:33.622
SOME OF THE OTHER WORK SO I

01:16:33.689 --> 01:16:35.157
THINK LEGITIMATELY THEY HAVE A

01:16:35.223 --> 01:16:36.091
RIGHT TO SAY.

01:16:36.158 --> 01:16:37.559
THIS IS GOING TO TAKE SOME.

01:16:37.626 --> 01:16:39.361
RESOURCES FOR US TO DO IT AS

01:16:39.428 --> 01:16:41.063
WELL OTHERWISE HE BE DOING IT

01:16:41.129 --> 01:16:41.630
RIGHT NOW.

01:16:41.697 --> 01:16:43.432
MORE IT'S JUST THAT IT IS

01:16:43.498 --> 01:16:45.267
RESOURCES AND WHAT WE WOULD

01:16:45.334 --> 01:16:46.868
SUGGEST IS THAT WE HAVE A

01:16:46.935 --> 01:16:48.003
PROGRAM AND I THINK I MENTIONED

01:16:48.070 --> 01:16:48.837
JUSTICE CENTER MORE OUT

01:16:48.904 --> 01:16:50.672
PREVIOUSLY WHAT WE'RE DOING IS

01:16:50.739 --> 01:16:54.376
WE'RE CREATING THAT NETWORK.

01:16:54.443 --> 01:16:55.711
WHICH DOESN'T COST MONEY.

01:16:55.777 --> 01:16:57.679
IT'S THE IMPLEMENTATION WHERE

01:16:57.746 --> 01:16:58.513
SOME OF THESE AGENCIES WILL SAY

01:16:58.580 --> 01:16:59.948
NOW WE'RE GETTING UP REALLY

01:17:00.015 --> 01:17:01.116
AGGRESSIVELY INTO THIS WITH YOU

01:17:01.183 --> 01:17:03.251
WE'RE PULLING OUR OUR OFFICERS

01:17:03.318 --> 01:17:05.020
FROM WHAT THEY WERE DOING FORTY

01:17:05.087 --> 01:17:05.787
SOME OF THIS THAT'S COSTING US

01:17:05.854 --> 01:17:06.521
MONEY.

01:17:06.588 --> 01:17:08.590
AND TIME THERE'S WHERE I THINK

01:17:08.657 --> 01:17:11.727
IT'S A IT'S A FAIR -- A NOTION

01:17:11.793 --> 01:17:13.028
TO COME UP WITH RESOURCES FOR

01:17:13.095 --> 01:17:15.630
THE BUT THE THE REQUEST THAT WE

01:17:15.697 --> 01:17:16.999
HAVE FOR THIS YEAR.

01:17:17.065 --> 01:17:17.733
IS NOT TO EXPAND TO DO IT

01:17:17.799 --> 01:17:19.501
OURSELVES IS TO BE ABLE TO

01:17:19.568 --> 01:17:20.969
ACTUALLY DO.

01:17:21.036 --> 01:17:23.038
JUST TO CATCH UP WORK AND THEN

01:17:23.105 --> 01:17:24.139
HOPEFULLY DO A BETTER JOB OF

01:17:24.206 --> 01:17:25.907
TRYING TO COORDINATE WITH THOSE

01:17:25.974 --> 01:17:27.342
AGENCIES BECAUSE LA COUNTY

01:17:27.409 --> 01:17:28.810
RIVERSIDE COUNTY WAS A WE CAN'T

01:17:28.877 --> 01:17:29.711
GO THERE ANYMORE.

01:17:29.778 --> 01:17:30.812
SO THAT'S WHEN WE HAVE TO TAKE

01:17:30.879 --> 01:17:32.647
OVER THE CASE WE CAN'T JUST DROP

01:17:32.714 --> 01:17:33.081
IT.

01:17:33.148 --> 01:17:34.816
AND SO IT'S IT'S A TIME

01:17:34.883 --> 01:17:36.351
INTENSIVE.

01:17:36.418 --> 01:17:38.020
LABOR INTENSIVE PROCESS THE

01:17:38.086 --> 01:17:39.921

LIKE MISSION THE BETTER WE ARE.

01:17:41.523 --> 01:17:42.858
THE MORE WE CAN GET BY AND FOR

01:17:42.924 --> 01:17:45.327
THE AGENCIES NOT JUST BOB

01:17:45.394 --> 01:17:46.895
FORSMAN THE COURT.

01:17:46.962 --> 01:17:47.596
THE EASIER IT WILL BE TO

01:17:47.662 --> 01:17:50.332
RETRIEVE SOME OF THESE WEAPONS.

01:17:50.399 --> 01:17:51.400
TOMORROW IS THE CAN GET INTO A

01:17:51.466 --> 01:17:52.934
BIG DISCUSSION ABOUT IN A SECOND

01:17:53.001 --> 01:17:54.102
SO I FEEL LIKE I SHOULD.

01:17:54.169 --> 01:17:56.238
MOVE US TO THOSE BUT LET ME JUST

01:17:56.304 --> 01:17:58.340

LAWS RELATIONSHIP TO A

01:18:13.822 --> 01:18:14.956
BACKSLIDING THAT THE FEDERAL

01:18:15.023 --> 01:18:17.426
GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN ENGAGED IN.

01:18:17.492 --> 01:18:20.395
ARM AND CLEARLY THERE IS -- YOU

01:18:20.462 --> 01:18:21.897

01:18:21.963 --> 01:18:23.698
YOU ALSO IN IN REFERENCE THE

01:18:23.765 --> 01:18:26.034

WE KNOW THAT.

01:18:31.373 --> 01:18:34.076
IT'S NOT UNCOMMON FOR A LAW THAT

01:18:34.142 --> 01:18:35.477
WE PASSED TO GET CHALLENGED.

01:18:35.544 --> 01:18:38.914

01:18:55.297 --> 01:18:57.299
ARE WE HAVE TO IN OTHER WORDS

01:18:57.365 --> 01:18:59.835
ONCE CALIFORNIA PASSES A LAW WE

01:18:59.901 --> 01:19:01.803
HAVE TO DEFEND IT.

01:19:01.870 --> 01:19:04.439
N. ON SO THERE ARE YOU KNOW

01:19:04.506 --> 01:19:06.041
WE'RE WE'RE LOOKING AT RESOURCES

THAT COVER KIND OF BOTH -- BUT

01:19:08.777 --> 01:19:11.279
IF I TAKE SB FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE

01:19:11.346 --> 01:19:13.682
FOR EXAMPLE.

01:19:13.748 --> 01:19:14.382
BE.

01:19:14.449 --> 01:19:16.618
YOUR DECISION AND YOUR OFFICES

01:19:16.685 --> 01:19:19.988
DECISION TO NOT RELEASE RECORDS

01:19:20.055 --> 01:19:21.990
HAS NOW RESULTED.

01:19:22.057 --> 01:19:23.692
IN THE STATE BEING SUED.

01:19:23.758 --> 01:19:25.827
SO WE ARE NOW BEING SUED BECAUSE

01:19:25.894 --> 01:19:28.196
WE DID NOT UPHOLD OUR OWN LOT.

01:19:28.263 --> 01:19:31.233
NOW YOU DESCRIBED THAT.

01:19:31.299 --> 01:19:35.437
YOUR SENSE WAS THAT GIVEN THAT.

01:19:35.504 --> 01:19:39.908
THERE WAS -- THE LAW UNTIL SB

01:19:39.975 --> 01:19:40.208
[inaudible]

01:19:40.275 --> 01:19:41.710
FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE CHANGED IT.

01:19:41.776 --> 01:19:43.812
THESE INVESTIGATORY RECORDS WERE

01:19:43.879 --> 01:19:45.480
NOT.

01:19:45.547 --> 01:19:48.016
ALLOWED TO BE PUBLIC.

01:19:48.083 --> 01:19:49.851
AND ONCE FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE

01:19:49.918 --> 01:19:51.853
PASSED AND WENT INTO EFFECT.

01:19:51.920 --> 01:19:53.822
THESE RECORDS WERE ALLOWED TO BE

01:19:53.889 --> 01:19:55.690
MADE PUBLIC.

01:19:55.757 --> 01:19:57.159
AND THERE WERE SOME COURTS THAT

01:19:57.225 --> 01:19:58.426
PUTS STAYS.

01:19:58.493 --> 01:20:07.669
NOW IN THE THERE ARE SOME COURTS

01:20:07.736 --> 01:20:10.639
TO PUT IN STAYS BUT EVERY COURT.

01:20:10.705 --> 01:20:12.140
THAT IS HELD A HEARING.

01:20:12.207 --> 01:20:13.275
ON THE BILL.

01:20:13.341 --> 01:20:14.943
HAS UPHELD THE BILL.

01:20:15.010 --> 01:20:16.144
AS WAS INTENDED BY THE

01:20:16.211 --> 01:20:18.613
LEGISLATURE WHICH THE TERM

01:20:18.680 --> 01:20:20.248
RETROACTIVE IT'S NOT ANY

01:20:20.315 --> 01:20:21.917
MATERIAL TERM HERE.

01:20:21.983 --> 01:20:23.752
BECAUSE RETROACTIVE WOULD BE.

01:20:23.818 --> 01:20:26.488
IF I REQUESTED RECORDS IN

01:20:26.555 --> 01:20:29.391
OCTOBER OF TWENTY EIGHT EIGHTEEN

01:20:29.457 --> 01:20:30.825
THE LAW IS NOT IN EFFECT IN

01:20:30.892 --> 01:20:33.061
OCTOBER OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN BUT

01:20:33.128 --> 01:20:34.696
THE ISSUE OF WHAT RECORDS ARE

01:20:34.763 --> 01:20:35.830
AVAILABLE TO ME.

01:20:35.897 --> 01:20:38.934

THE PUBLIC RECORDS ACT IN

SO UNDER WHAT SCENARIO.

01:21:48.670 --> 01:21:51.406

01:21:53.174 --> 01:21:56.044
DO YOU GET A GREEN LIGHT.

01:21:56.111 --> 01:21:57.279
THE BELL CURVE -- UNLESS YOU'RE

01:21:57.345 --> 01:21:58.280
SPEAKING ABOUT A CASE I'M NOT

01:21:58.346 --> 01:21:59.581
FAMILIAR WITH THE CASE THAT

01:21:59.648 --> 01:22:00.982
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THAT WHERE

01:22:01.049 --> 01:22:02.517
THE APPELLATE COURT ISSUED A

01:22:02.584 --> 01:22:04.219
RULING THAT WAS A RULING.

01:22:04.286 --> 01:22:07.088
THAT WAS BASED ON A PETITION FOR

01:22:07.155 --> 01:22:08.757
A RE SENSUALLY A STAY.

01:22:08.823 --> 01:22:10.925
IT WAS IN A AGAIN UNLESS THIS IS

01:22:10.992 --> 01:22:12.060
A DIFFERENT CASE THIS IS THE

01:22:12.127 --> 01:22:16.164
FIRST APPELLATE COURT -- AND IT

01:22:16.231 --> 01:22:16.998
WAS A DECISION.

01:22:17.065 --> 01:22:18.900
THAT WAS RENDERED ON WHETHER OR

01:22:18.967 --> 01:22:20.402
NOT THERE SHOULD BE A STATE.

01:22:20.468 --> 01:22:23.438
OF THE TRIAL COURT THE LOWER

01:22:23.505 --> 01:22:24.773
COURT COURT ACTIONS.

01:22:24.839 --> 01:22:26.875
IT WAS IN AND A RULING ON THE

01:22:26.941 --> 01:22:28.310
MERITS OF THE CASE.

01:22:28.376 --> 01:22:30.345
IT RULED THAT THE SUPPLIES

01:22:30.412 --> 01:22:31.780
STATEWIDE.

01:22:31.846 --> 01:22:36.685
AND THAT THE RECORDS WERE THAT

01:22:36.751 --> 01:22:37.285
FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE APPLY TO

01:22:37.352 --> 01:22:38.586
REORDS IN IN AGENCIES

01:22:38.653 --> 01:22:40.322
POSSESSION.

01:22:40.388 --> 01:22:41.523
AS A AS I SAID F IT MAYBE

01:22:41.589 --> 01:22:43.124
THAT'S A DECISION THAT I'M NOT

01:22:43.191 --> 01:22:44.559
FAMILIAR WITH BUT IF IT'S THE

01:22:44.626 --> 01:22:46.361
DECISION THAT I BELIEVE YOU'RE

01:22:46.428 --> 01:22:47.128
REFERRING.

01:22:47.195 --> 01:22:49.397
TO AND THE FIRST BILL COURT.

01:22:49.464 --> 01:22:51.633
THEN IT IS NOT A RULING ON THE

01:22:51.700 --> 01:22:54.402
MERITS IT WAS A PETITION THAT

01:22:54.469 --> 01:22:56.838
WAS FILED -- BY ONE OF THE

01:22:56.905 --> 01:22:59.808
PARTIES TO STAY THE LOWER COURT

01:22:59.874 --> 01:23:00.975
ACTION.

01:23:01.042 --> 01:23:02.944
AND THE THE RULING IS ON WHETHER

01:23:03.011 --> 01:23:03.878
OR NOT.

01:23:03.945 --> 01:23:06.047
OR IT SHOULD STAY THE LOWER

01:23:06.114 --> 01:23:07.682
COURT ACTION YES AND THE LOWER

01:23:07.749 --> 01:23:09.184
COURTS ACTION WAS ON THE MERITS

01:23:09.250 --> 01:23:10.051
SO IN OTHER WORDS EVERY COURT

01:23:10.118 --> 01:23:11.353
THAT IS HEARD IT ON THE MERITS

01:23:11.419 --> 01:23:12.954
HAS RULED THAT THEIR RECORDS CAN

01:23:13.021 --> 01:23:13.888
BE RELEASED.

01:23:13.955 --> 01:23:16.491
AND SO THE APPELLATE COURT JUST

01:23:16.558 --> 01:23:18.326
UP HELD THAT.

01:23:18.393 --> 01:23:18.993
BRITISH ON THIS DAY ISSUE BUT IT

01:23:19.060 --> 01:23:20.128
DID NOT RULE ON THE MERITS OF

01:23:20.195 --> 01:23:21.262
THE CASE IT MADE A VERY CLEAR

01:23:21.329 --> 01:23:22.364
STATEMENT.

01:23:22.430 --> 01:23:24.766
THAT DOESN'T GO TO THE TO THE

01:23:24.833 --> 01:23:27.202
NEED -- TO TO MAKE A DECISION ON

01:23:27.268 --> 01:23:29.904
THE ON THE PETITION FOR THIS DAY

01:23:29.971 --> 01:23:31.639
BUT WHAT IT DID MAKE AS I SAID

01:23:31.706 --> 01:23:33.241
IN MY OWN -- REMARKS IS THAT IT

01:23:33.308 --> 01:23:34.075
MADE A VERY CLEAR STATEMENT

01:23:34.142 --> 01:23:35.577
ABOUT WHERE IT WAS HEADING.

01:23:35.643 --> 01:23:36.978
I GET THAT.

01:23:37.045 --> 01:23:38.813
AND SOON I BELIEVE YOU'RE GOING

01:23:38.880 --> 01:23:40.882
TO HAVE A DECISION ON THE MERITS

01:23:40.949 --> 01:23:43.051
THAT WE CAN RELY ON BECAUSE THAT

01:23:43.118 --> 01:23:45.687
QUIRK FUNDS AND WHAT COURT.

01:23:45.754 --> 01:23:48.189
SORRY THERE IS COURT THAT'S IN

01:23:48.256 --> 01:23:49.891
COURT IS GOING TO HEAR THE CASE.

01:23:49.958 --> 01:23:50.458
THE AGAIN THE RULING BY THE

01:23:50.525 --> 01:23:51.059
COURT DOESN'T DISPOSE OF THE

01:23:51.126 --> 01:23:52.227
ISSUE.

01:23:52.293 --> 01:23:53.461
THE RULING THAT THE COURT ISSUED

01:23:53.528 --> 01:23:55.263
SIMPLY SAID WE'RE NOT GOING TO

01:23:55.330 --> 01:23:56.931
STAY IN FORSMAN.

01:23:56.998 --> 01:23:58.533
WHILE WE GET READY TO LISTEN TO

01:23:58.600 --> 01:24:00.235
THE CASE.

01:24:00.301 --> 01:24:01.603
SO IT WAS NOT A RULING ON THE

01:24:01.669 --> 01:24:03.405
CASE ITSELF ON THE MERITS OF THE

01:24:03.471 --> 01:24:04.706
CASE IT WAS A RULING ON A

01:24:04.773 --> 01:24:06.541
PETITION BY ONE OF THE PARTIES A

01:24:06.608 --> 01:24:07.742
WHERE IT WHILE WE'RE GOING TO

01:24:07.809 --> 01:24:08.877
WHERE YOU CAN REVIEW THIS.

01:24:08.943 --> 01:24:10.712
PUT A HOLD ON EVERYTHING THE

01:24:10.779 --> 01:24:13.281
COURT SAID OF THE VIDEO SO THE

01:24:13.348 --> 01:24:14.916
DIFFICULTY I'M HAVING IS THAT.

01:24:14.983 --> 01:24:17.318
AS THE PERSON WHO IS RESPONSIBLE

01:24:17.385 --> 01:24:18.953
FOR IN AFFECTING FORCING THE LOS

01:24:19.020 --> 01:24:20.488
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

01:24:20.555 --> 01:24:22.457
THE PRESIDENT'S IN PREVIOUS IN

01:24:22.524 --> 01:24:24.192
ALL PREVIOUS COURT RULING TO NOT

TO DO WITH JUST FOURTEEN TWENTY

01:24:26.027 --> 01:24:28.229
ONE BUT IN GENERAL AROUND THE

01:24:28.296 --> 01:24:30.598
ENACTMENT OF LAWS.

01:24:30.665 --> 01:24:34.235
IS AN FIVE I DON'T HAVE -- RIGHT

01:24:34.302 --> 01:24:36.204
IN FRONT OF ME THESE COUPLE OF

01:24:36.271 --> 01:24:37.705
CASES THAT I'M GONNA RIP

01:24:37.772 --> 01:24:39.974
REFERENCE BUT I DID IN IT

01:24:40.041 --> 01:24:42.844
INDEPENDENT -- COMMUNICATION TO

01:24:42.911 --> 01:24:43.311
CITE THEM [inaudible]

01:24:43.378 --> 01:24:49.617
THAT. EIGHT LOCALITIES WHOEVER

01:24:49.684 --> 01:24:52.253
THAT ONE CANNOT OPT NOT TO

01:24:52.320 --> 01:24:55.023
FOLLOW A LAW THAT WAS ENACTED IN

01:24:55.089 --> 01:24:56.558
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

01:24:56.624 --> 01:24:58.293
ASSUMING THAT.

01:24:58.359 --> 01:25:01.596
THE LAW IS GOING TO BE.

01:25:01.663 --> 01:25:03.932
THEN REVERSED BY THE COURT SO IN

01:25:03.998 --> 01:25:05.934
OTHER WORDS THE THERE ARE

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:07.502
CALIFORNIA STATE SUPREME COURT

01:25:07.569 --> 01:25:10.205
RULINGS THAT BASICALLY SAY ONCE

01:25:10.271 --> 01:25:11.773
THE LAWS ENACTED.

01:25:11.840 --> 01:25:13.641
EVEN IF SOMEONE SUSPECTS THAT IT

01:25:13.708 --> 01:25:15.643
MIGHT BE OVERTURNED THAT UNTIL

01:25:15.710 --> 01:25:18.379
THE COURT ACTS TO OVERTURN IT.

01:25:18.446 --> 01:25:21.282
AT A LOSS TO BE RESPECTED ENOUGH

01:25:21.349 --> 01:25:21.483
FELT.

01:25:21.549 --> 01:25:22.617
SO.

01:25:22.684 --> 01:25:24.452
THAT FIRST AND FOREMOST WE'VE

01:25:24.519 --> 01:25:26.688
NOT YET HAD ANY COURT ON THE

01:25:26.754 --> 01:25:28.957
MERITS.

01:25:29.023 --> 01:25:30.258
REVERSE THE LOCK.

01:25:30.325 --> 01:25:32.427
SO THE LAW IS IN PLACE IT WAS

01:25:32.494 --> 01:25:33.928
SIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR.

01:25:33.995 --> 01:25:35.396
AND SO I GUESS FOR ME THE

01:25:35.463 --> 01:25:38.666
TROUBLE IS AS OUR ENFORCER OF

01:25:38.733 --> 01:25:40.101
OUR STATE LAWS.

01:25:40.168 --> 01:25:41.836
WHY IS IT THAT?

01:25:41.903 --> 01:25:43.471
YOU ARE NOT HONORING THAT LAW.

01:25:43.538 --> 01:25:45.607
LET ME USE YOUR FRAMING OF OF

01:25:45.673 --> 01:25:46.875
THE MATTER AND HOPEFULLY THIS

01:25:46.941 --> 01:25:48.243
WILL EXPLAIN.

01:25:48.309 --> 01:25:50.411
IF THIS WERE A CASE WHERE IT WAS

01:25:50.478 --> 01:25:54.148
SIMPLY A MATTER OF INTERPRETING.

01:25:54.215 --> 01:25:55.016
FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE THIS NEW LAW

01:25:55.083 --> 01:25:56.851
AND WHAT WE DO WITH REGARD TO

01:25:56.918 --> 01:25:57.886
RECORDS.

01:25:57.952 --> 01:25:59.921
THAT PREVIOUSLY WERE NOT

01:25:59.988 --> 01:26:00.421
DISCLOSED.

01:26:00.488 --> 01:26:02.757
UNDER A PUBLIC RECORDS ACT.

01:26:02.824 --> 01:26:04.792
I COULD UNDERSTAND.

01:26:04.859 --> 01:26:06.261
THE CONCERN YOU RAISE ABOUT THE

01:26:06.327 --> 01:26:08.062
THE LEGAL INTERPRETATION OF WHAT

01:26:08.129 --> 01:26:08.663
WE WHAT HAPPENS WITH THE NEW

01:26:08.730 --> 01:26:09.464
STATUTES.

01:26:09.531 --> 01:26:11.032
AND HOW YOU SHOULD INTERPRET AND

01:26:11.099 --> 01:26:12.333
YOU SHOULD WAIT FOR COURT TO

01:26:12.400 --> 01:26:13.468
MAKE A DECISION.

01:26:13.535 --> 01:26:14.402
BUT AS YOU SAID ON SEVERAL

01:26:14.469 --> 01:26:17.038
OCCASIONS MY JOB IS TO ENFORCE

01:26:17.105 --> 01:26:18.540
IN A POLL TO LAWS.

01:26:18.606 --> 01:26:20.608
THERE IS A PARTY THERE WERE

01:26:20.675 --> 01:26:21.676
PARTICULAR WHAT'S.

01:26:21.743 --> 01:26:22.944
THAT WERE IN THE BOOKS EXISTING

01:26:23.011 --> 01:26:25.747
BEFORE SB FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE

01:26:25.813 --> 01:26:28.283
BECAME LAW THAT PROTECTED.

01:26:28.349 --> 01:26:31.553
PRIVATE INFORMATION OF OFFICERS.

01:26:31.619 --> 01:26:32.554
THAT EXISTED IN LAW FOR QUITE

01:26:32.620 --> 01:26:34.255
SOME TIME.

01:26:34.322 --> 01:26:36.157
THERE IS NO RULING IN ANY COURT

01:26:36.224 --> 01:26:37.825
SAYING THAT THAT LAW IS NO

01:26:37.892 --> 01:26:40.428
LONGER IN EFFECT NO BUT FOURTEEN

01:26:40.495 --> 01:26:41.462
TWENTY ONE REVERSE THOSE WERE

01:26:41.529 --> 01:26:43.398
THAT WAS AS YOU POINTED OUT A

01:26:43.464 --> 01:26:44.899
LAW THAT THE LEGISLATURE PUT SO

01:26:44.966 --> 01:26:47.502
THAT STATUTE OF PROTECTION.

01:26:47.569 --> 01:26:48.436
WAS PUT IN EFFECT BY THE

01:26:48.503 --> 01:26:51.172
LEGISLATURE THE LEGISLATURE THEN

01:26:51.239 --> 01:26:52.240
REVERSED THAT STATUTE.

01:26:52.307 --> 01:26:53.508
AND I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE

01:26:53.575 --> 01:26:56.344
SAYING ABOUT YOUR THAT. FOURTEEN

01:26:56.411 --> 01:26:57.478
TWENTY ONE CHANGE THE THE TYPES

01:26:57.545 --> 01:27:00.415
OF DOCUMENTS AT A PUBLIC RECORDS

01:27:00.481 --> 01:27:00.949
ACT.

01:27:01.015 --> 01:27:01.716
REACH.

01:27:01.783 --> 01:27:03.918
BUT THERE WAS NOTHING IN YOUR

01:27:03.985 --> 01:27:06.721
BILL THAT PASSED THAT.

01:27:06.788 --> 01:27:08.256
AS EXPRESSLY.

01:27:08.323 --> 01:27:10.892
AND DID THE PRIVACY PROTECTIONS

01:27:10.959 --> 01:27:12.160
THAT ALONG FORSMAN OFFICERS HAVE

01:27:12.226 --> 01:27:13.461
HAD.

01:27:13.528 --> 01:27:14.896
AND SO WHAT I SAID.

01:27:14.963 --> 01:27:16.998
IN TRYING TO RESPOND TO REQUESTS

01:27:17.065 --> 01:27:20.068
FOR THOSE PUBLIC RECORDS THAT-PRE DATED JANUARY FIRST TWENTY

01:27:20.134 --> 01:27:20.668
NINETEEN IS.

01:27:20.735 --> 01:27:22.904
THERE IS AN ISSUE BECAUSE YOU

01:27:22.971 --> 01:27:24.439
HAVE EXISTING LAWS THAT PROTECT.

APPLES TO ORANGES I WOULD CALL

01:30:06.801 --> 01:30:09.237
IT APPLES TO A PIECE OF STEAK.

01:30:09.303 --> 01:30:11.172
AND THE REASON IS YOU ARE

01:30:11.239 --> 01:30:13.908
REFERENCING WHAT A FEDERAL

01:30:13.975 --> 01:30:15.843
AGENCY WANTS FROM YOU THAT WOULD

01:30:15.910 --> 01:30:17.979
BE POTENTIALLY IF I UNDERSTAND

01:30:18.045 --> 01:30:19.280
CORRECTLY IN DEFIANCE OF

01:30:19.347 --> 01:30:20.882
CALIFORNIA STATE LAW.

01:30:20.948 --> 01:30:24.452
WHAT I AM REFERENCING IS A?

01:30:24.519 --> 01:30:27.455
CALIFORNIA STATE LAW WELL YOU

FIFTY CURES YOU SAID IS PRIVATE.

01:30:28.856 --> 01:30:31.559
SO THERE'S BEEN NO ACTION THAT

01:30:31.626 --> 01:30:32.927
I'M AWARE OF BY THE STATE

01:30:32.994 --> 01:30:35.429
LEGISLATURE.

01:30:35.496 --> 01:30:36.831
THAT WOULD SAY TO YOU.

01:30:36.898 --> 01:30:38.399
RELEASE THOSE RECORDS TO THAT

01:30:38.466 --> 01:30:39.734
THE D. E. A. ONCE.

01:30:39.801 --> 01:30:42.136
THERE HAS BEEN AN ACTION BY THE

01:30:42.203 --> 01:30:44.038
STATE LEGISLATURE SIGNED BY THE

01:30:44.105 --> 01:30:46.107
GOVERNOR AND UP HELD BY THE

01:30:46.174 --> 01:30:49.777
APPELLATE COURT. TO MAKE A

01:30:49.844 --> 01:30:51.445
CERTAIN AND LIMITED SET OF

01:30:51.512 --> 01:30:54.482
INVESTIGATORY RECORDS NOW PUBLIC.

01:30:54.549 --> 01:30:59.120
SO IT IS VERY DIFFICULT.

01:30:59.187 --> 01:31:00.888
TO SET IN THIS SEAT.

01:31:00.955 --> 01:31:03.958
AND HAVE THAT ANALOGY BE MADE AS

01:31:04.025 --> 01:31:06.727
TO WHY THAT IS SOMEHOW SIMILAR

01:31:06.794 --> 01:31:08.162
TO YOUR DE A CASE.

01:31:08.229 --> 01:31:11.199
BUT SECONDARILY IT RACES.

01:31:11.265 --> 01:31:13.034
WELL I DON'T HAVE A PARTICULAR

01:31:13.100 --> 01:31:14.802
OTHER LAW THAT I CAN BRING UP

01:31:14.869 --> 01:31:17.305
RIGHT NOW BUT I'M SURE IN A HALF

01:31:17.371 --> 01:31:19.440
AN HOUR OR SO ONE WILL COME TO

01:31:19.507 --> 01:31:20.541
ME.

01:31:20.608 --> 01:31:22.410
THAT IT'S RATE LIKE AN ELECTIVE

01:31:22.476 --> 01:31:24.011
DECISION AS TO WHICH OF OUR

01:31:24.078 --> 01:31:25.246
LARGE WILL ENFORCE IN WHICH YOU

01:31:25.313 --> 01:31:27.782
WANT SO I AM CERTAIN THAT THERE

01:31:27.849 --> 01:31:30.151
ARE OTHER PRIVACY LAWS.

01:31:30.218 --> 01:31:32.954
OR LAWS RELATING TO SOME ASPECT

01:31:33.020 --> 01:31:33.988
OF WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN

01:31:34.055 --> 01:31:35.723
PERCEIVED TO BE A PREVIOUSLY

01:31:35.790 --> 01:31:37.758
PROTECTED PRIVACY RIGHT THAT THE

01:31:37.825 --> 01:31:39.627
LEGISLATURE HAS CHANGED. FOR

01:31:39.694 --> 01:31:41.462
WHICH I AM NOT AWARE THAT THE

01:31:41.529 --> 01:31:44.599
AG'S OFFICE THAN DID NOT ENFORCE.

01:31:44.665 --> 01:31:46.701
SO I IT.

01:31:46.767 --> 01:31:52.473
IS A I THINK THAT -- I WOULD

01:31:52.540 --> 01:31:53.674
SUBMIT THAT THE AGENCY HAS PUT

01:31:53.741 --> 01:31:54.709
ITSELF IN A VERY DIFFICULT

01:31:54.775 --> 01:31:56.244
POSITION IN RELATIONSHIP TO

01:31:56.310 --> 01:31:58.112

THIS CASE HAS CHOSEN.

01:32:01.983 --> 01:32:04.385
NOT TO FOLLOW.

01:32:04.452 --> 01:32:04.919

WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.

01:32:10.524 --> 01:32:13.094
AND I HOPE THAT YOU'LL

01:32:13.160 --> 01:32:14.595
APPRECIATE THE POSITION I'M IN

01:32:14.662 --> 01:32:16.831
IN TRYING TO ENFORCE OUR LAWS

01:32:16.898 --> 01:32:18.833
THERE WERE OTHER LAWS IN EFFECT

01:32:18.900 --> 01:32:20.301

MAKE SURE THAT WE DO THIS THE

01:34:20.755 --> 01:34:21.522

PERMANENT FUNDING SOLUTION TO

01:35:52.079 --> 01:35:52.980
SUPPORT THE BUREAU'S CRITICAL

01:35:53.047 --> 01:35:54.548
TIME SENSITIVE REGULATORY

01:35:54.615 --> 01:35:56.317
WORKLOAD WHICH CAN NO LONGER BE

01:35:56.383 --> 01:35:57.818
TEMPORARILY ABSORBED.

01:35:57.885 --> 01:35:59.386
AND MARTIN WHO RAN THE DIRECTOR

01:35:59.453 --> 01:36:01.222
IS HERE TO ANSWER ANY TECHNICAL

01:36:01.288 --> 01:36:10.030
QUESTIONS.

01:36:10.097 --> 01:36:11.565
I KNOW MY COLLEAGUES WE HAVE

01:36:11.632 --> 01:36:13.300
ASKED SOME ARE THERE ADDITIONAL

01:36:13.367 --> 01:36:15.202
ONES I GUESS THE ONE I WOULD

01:36:15.269 --> 01:36:16.704
LIKE TO ASK BUT IS GIVEN THAT.

01:36:16.770 --> 01:36:19.507
SOME OF THIS IS -- RELATED TO

01:36:19.573 --> 01:36:22.743
THE DROSS.

01:36:22.810 --> 01:36:23.844
COUNTING FUNDS WE HAVE FROM

01:36:23.911 --> 01:36:26.947
DROST.

01:36:27.014 --> 01:36:28.616
IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THE

01:36:28.682 --> 01:36:32.353
AGENCY HAS THE AUTHORITY. TO

01:36:32.419 --> 01:36:33.854
ADDRESS THE DROSS FEE BASED ON

01:36:33.921 --> 01:36:35.656
INFLATION.

01:36:35.723 --> 01:36:39.527
AND I DON'T SEE THAT THE AGENCY

01:36:39.593 --> 01:36:41.896
HAS PUT FORWARD ANY RECORD ANY

01:36:41.962 --> 01:36:44.198
MOTION TO DO SO WE DON'T YOU

01:36:44.265 --> 01:36:44.999
DON'T EVEN NEED OUR APPROVAL FOR

01:36:45.065 --> 01:36:45.766
THAT.

01:36:45.833 --> 01:36:48.102
BUT WHAT I DO SEE IS A REQUEST

01:36:48.169 --> 01:36:50.271
FOR GENERAL FUND THAT MIGHT.

01:36:50.337 --> 01:36:52.506
AT SOME LEVEL OF IT MIGHT BE

01:36:52.573 --> 01:36:55.142
COVERED IF THE FEE WERE ADJUSTED

01:36:55.209 --> 01:36:58.746
TO COVER THE AND WHAT'S AT THE

01:36:58.812 --> 01:37:00.548
INFLATION SINCE THE LAST TIME.

01:37:00.614 --> 01:37:02.416
THE MANAGER THERE IS CURRENT

01:37:02.483 --> 01:37:04.351
AUTHORITY TO ADJUST THE FEE --

01:37:04.418 --> 01:37:05.286
RELATED TO THE DRESS FUND IN THE

01:37:05.352 --> 01:37:07.421
GAS PROGRAM HOWEVER THE PROPOSAL

01:37:07.488 --> 01:37:08.756
FOR THE GENERAL FUND TO REQUEST

01:37:08.822 --> 01:37:10.391
RELATES TO THE APPS PROGRAM.

01:37:10.457 --> 01:37:12.426
AND SO THE THE PROPOSAL WOULD

01:37:12.493 --> 01:37:12.993
FIND THAT THERE IS IT AFTER

01:37:13.060 --> 01:37:14.728
PROPOSAL -- THAT WOULD BE FUNDED

01:37:14.795 --> 01:37:15.963
BY THE GENERAL FUND.

01:37:16.030 --> 01:37:18.432
RATHER THAN USING THE FEE SOURCE

01:37:18.499 --> 01:37:20.201
FROM THE DEALER RECORD OF SALE

01:37:20.267 --> 01:37:21.335
FIND.

01:37:21.402 --> 01:37:21.835
THAT THAT'S THE PRIMARY

01:37:21.902 --> 01:37:23.237
DIFFERENCE WHY YOU'RE SEEING --

01:37:23.304 --> 01:37:24.638
GENERAL FUND ASK AND THEN

01:37:24.705 --> 01:37:26.807
THERE'S ANOTHER FUND -- FOR THE

01:37:26.874 --> 01:37:29.443
THE THE PRIMARY ADDRESS -- FOR

01:37:29.510 --> 01:37:31.111
ACTIVITIES IS READY TO SCRIBES

01:37:31.178 --> 01:37:32.413
THAT THERE IS OPERATIONAL

01:37:32.479 --> 01:37:34.248
SHORTFALL OF GROSS AND NET IT

01:37:34.315 --> 01:37:35.983
ALSO DESCRIBES TRYING TO MAKE UP

01:37:36.050 --> 01:37:37.618
SOME GENERAL FUND FOR THAT

01:37:37.685 --> 01:37:38.852
OPERATIONAL SHORTFALL.

01:37:38.919 --> 01:37:42.323
SO WHAT I'M RAISING IS.

01:37:42.389 --> 01:37:43.457
I'D LIKE TO KNOW WHAT THE

01:37:43.524 --> 01:37:45.926
SHORTFALL WOULD BE ONCE THE FEE

01:37:45.993 --> 01:37:47.928
WAS ADJUSTED.

01:37:47.995 --> 01:37:49.496
DUE TO A BASED ON THE AUTHORITY

01:37:49.563 --> 01:37:50.831
YOU HALF.

01:37:50.898 --> 01:37:53.734
OVER TO DO A FEE INCREASE.

01:37:53.801 --> 01:37:55.669
THROUGH THE REGULATORY PROCESS --

01:37:55.736 --> 01:37:57.471
WE WOULD HAVE TO INCREASE IT I

01:37:57.538 --> 01:37:59.440
BELIEVE IT'S SIX DOLLARS RIGHT

01:37:59.506 --> 01:38:01.375
NOW SIX OR SEVEN DOLLARS TO KEEP

01:38:01.442 --> 01:38:02.576
UP.

01:38:02.643 --> 01:38:04.245
I'M NOT ASKING THAT I'M ASKING

01:38:04.311 --> 01:38:07.114
YOU FOR YOU HAVE THE AUTHORITY.

01:38:07.181 --> 01:38:10.017
TO ADJUST THE FEE BASED ON THE

01:38:10.084 --> 01:38:11.785
INFLATIONARY.

01:38:11.852 --> 01:38:13.754
AND IT WOULD IT MIGHT NOT GIVE

01:38:13.821 --> 01:38:16.323
YOU THE FULL RECOVERY BUT IT.

01:38:16.390 --> 01:38:18.225
AND I DON'T I DON'T HAVE AN

01:38:18.292 --> 01:38:19.927
ESTIMATE I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT

01:38:19.994 --> 01:38:21.061
WHAT THAT.

01:38:21.128 --> 01:38:22.696
MIGHT PROVIDE YOU IN TERMS OF

01:38:22.763 --> 01:38:23.897
REVENUE BUT IT WOULD GIVE ME

01:38:23.964 --> 01:38:25.499
THEN A BETTER SENSE OF WHAT YOU

01:38:25.566 --> 01:38:27.268
WOULD NEED TO AND THE DIFFERENCE

01:38:27.334 --> 01:38:28.435
BETWEEN.

01:38:28.502 --> 01:38:29.036
THAT.

01:38:29.103 --> 01:38:30.337
REVENUE.

01:38:30.404 --> 01:38:31.839
AND WHAT GENERAL FUND BACKFILL

01:38:31.905 --> 01:38:33.674
WE MAY NEED.

01:38:33.741 --> 01:38:34.642
SO.

01:38:34.708 --> 01:38:37.978
I'M JUST I UNDERSTAND AND AND I

01:38:38.045 --> 01:38:39.580
RELATES PRIMARILY TO THOSE

01:38:39.647 --> 01:38:41.115
ACTIVITIES THAT OUR APPS PROGRAM

01:38:41.181 --> 01:38:47.054
RELATED.

01:38:47.121 --> 01:38:48.355
THERE SEEMS TO BE A DIFFERENCE

01:38:48.422 --> 01:38:49.890
IN THE MATERIALS I HALF BUT

01:38:49.957 --> 01:38:51.358
THAT'S OKAY BUT I THINK A WOULD

01:38:51.425 --> 01:38:52.793
BE.

01:38:52.860 --> 01:38:54.928
USE FOR AT LEAST.

01:38:54.995 --> 01:38:56.363
THIS COMMITTEE WOULD APPRECIATE.

01:38:56.430 --> 01:38:59.133
I'M GETTING SOME ESTIMATE OF

01:38:59.199 --> 01:39:02.069
WHAT REVENUE THE DROSS ACCOUNT

01:39:02.136 --> 01:39:03.437
WOULD RECEIVE.

01:39:03.504 --> 01:39:06.206
IF THE FIGHT FEE WAS ADJUSTED

01:39:06.273 --> 01:39:08.242
FOR INFLATION.

01:39:08.309 --> 01:39:10.144
OKAY AND WE CAN WORK WITH STAFF

01:39:10.210 --> 01:39:11.912
TO GET THAT GREAT.

01:39:11.979 --> 01:39:14.048
GREAT CENTER MOORLACH -- I'M

01:39:14.114 --> 01:39:14.915
JUST CURIOUS HOW YOU INTEND TO

01:39:14.982 --> 01:39:23.057
HIRE THE TWENTY SIX POSITIONS.

01:39:23.123 --> 01:39:25.626
SB ELEVEN YES.

01:39:25.693 --> 01:39:27.094
GOOD AFTERNOON MARTIN RAN

01:39:27.161 --> 01:39:29.063
DIRECTOR OF GIRL FARMS.

01:39:29.129 --> 01:39:32.666
SO ARE HIRING METHODOLOGIES HAVE

01:39:32.733 --> 01:39:35.169
CONTINUED -- AS THEY HAVE IN THE

01:39:35.235 --> 01:39:36.837
PAST AND WE WOULD CONTINUE WERE

01:39:36.904 --> 01:39:38.739
WERE HOPING FOR CONTRACT

01:39:38.806 --> 01:39:40.874
NEGOTIATIONS IMPROVED -- PAY

01:39:40.941 --> 01:39:42.843
PACKAGES THAT WILL FURTHER ALLOW

01:39:42.910 --> 01:39:45.079
US TO BETTER RECRUIT AND RETAIN

01:39:45.145 --> 01:39:48.449
INDIVIDUALS -- BUT EVEN IF THAT.

01:39:48.515 --> 01:39:50.751
DOES NOT HAPPEN WE ARE DOING OUR

01:39:50.818 --> 01:39:52.586
BEST.

01:39:52.653 --> 01:39:54.655
TO ADVERTISE AND AND AND DO

01:39:54.722 --> 01:39:56.056
EXAMINATIONS FOUR TIMES A YEAR

01:39:56.123 --> 01:39:57.658
WE'RE JUST HAVING A LOT OF

01:39:57.725 --> 01:39:59.827
DIFFICULTY NOWADAYS BECAUSE OF

01:39:59.893 --> 01:40:02.096
OUR OUR PAY LEVELS HAD STAYED

01:40:02.162 --> 01:40:04.932
RELATIVELY -- STAGNANT FOR SOLAR

01:40:04.998 --> 01:40:07.034
YEARS WIPING A LOT OF AGENCIES

01:40:07.101 --> 01:40:08.569
HAVE GRADUALLY INCREASED.

01:40:08.635 --> 01:40:11.772
AND IN ADDITION TO THAT WITH THE

01:40:11.839 --> 01:40:13.574
PENSION SYSTEM MODIFICATIONS WE

01:40:13.640 --> 01:40:15.376
WOULD NORMALLY ON A REGULAR

01:40:15.442 --> 01:40:17.244
BASIS RECRUIT INDIVIDUALS THAT

01:40:17.311 --> 01:40:19.279
WERE EXPERIENCED INVESTIGATORS

01:40:19.346 --> 01:40:21.081
FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES.

01:40:21.148 --> 01:40:22.416
BUT BAY ARE GRANDFATHERED IN TO

01:40:22.483 --> 01:40:24.918
THE PREVIOUS PENSION SYSTEM SO

01:40:24.985 --> 01:40:26.620
IN ORDER FOR THEM TO LEAVE AND

01:40:26.687 --> 01:40:28.255
COME TO THE STATE -- THEY WOULD

01:40:28.322 --> 01:40:31.024
NOW COME INTO THE NEW LOWER TIER.

01:40:31.091 --> 01:40:34.027
SO -- THAT ALSO MAKES IT VERY

01:40:34.094 --> 01:40:36.196
DIFFICULT FOR US -- TO RECRUIT

01:40:36.263 --> 01:40:37.898
AND AND HIGHER INDIVIDUALS WE'RE

01:40:37.965 --> 01:40:40.000
STILL PROGRESSING DOWN THAT PATH

01:40:40.067 --> 01:40:41.535
IT'S JUST A MUCH.

01:40:41.602 --> 01:40:44.471
SLOWER PROCESS AND THERE'S FEWER

01:40:44.538 --> 01:40:47.174
INDIVIDUALS -- TO EXAMINED

01:40:47.241 --> 01:40:48.709
DURING THE TESTING AND SELECTION

01:40:48.776 --> 01:40:49.810
PROCESS.

01:40:49.877 --> 01:40:51.445
WHICH IS ALL ALREADY VERY

01:40:51.512 --> 01:40:53.547
DIFFICULT SO THE THE FAILURE

01:40:53.614 --> 01:40:56.850
RATE BASED ON EXAMINATIONS --

01:40:56.917 --> 01:40:58.886
POLYGRAPH MEDICAL PSYCHOLOGICAL

01:40:58.952 --> 01:41:01.588
THERE'S THERE'S A HIGH -- DROP

01:41:01.655 --> 01:41:03.791
OUT RATE DURING THAT PROCESS

01:41:03.857 --> 01:41:05.058
MANY YEARS AGO WE HAD.

01:41:05.125 --> 01:41:08.228
UPWARDS OF TEN THOUSAND PEOPLE

01:41:08.295 --> 01:41:09.096
THAT WOULD TAKE THE EXAMINATION.

01:41:09.163 --> 01:41:10.297
WHEN THEY WERE OFFERED --

01:41:10.364 --> 01:41:13.133
NOWADAYS IT'S IN THE HUNDREDS.

01:41:13.200 --> 01:41:14.468
SO WE WILL CONTINUE WITH OUR

01:41:14.535 --> 01:41:16.870
PROCESS TO RECRUIT -- AND GET

01:41:16.937 --> 01:41:19.306
OUT AND EXPRESS FURTHER WHAT W

01:41:19.373 --> 01:41:21.275
DO HOW WE DO IT HOW WE CAN HELP

01:41:21.341 --> 01:41:22.643
LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES

01:41:22.709 --> 01:41:24.645
AND TRY TO RECRUIT FOLKS OVER IT

01:41:24.711 --> 01:41:25.946
JUST MAKES IT MUCH MORE.

01:41:26.013 --> 01:41:28.315
DIFFICULT GIVEN THE CURRENT --

01:41:28.382 --> 01:41:30.984
SALARY DISPARITY THAT WE HAVE

01:41:31.051 --> 01:41:31.618
WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT

01:41:31.685 --> 01:41:32.486
OF JUSTICE.

01:41:32.553 --> 01:41:33.821
IS IT CONSIDERED AN ENTRY LEVEL

01:41:33.887 --> 01:41:35.789
POSITION.

01:41:35.856 --> 01:41:38.492
WELL WE HAVE TWO POSITIONS --

01:41:38.559 --> 01:41:40.894
THAT WE WOULD BRING IN AS ENTRY

01:41:40.961 --> 01:41:42.196
LEVEL ONE WOULD BE -- AN

01:41:42.262 --> 01:41:43.497
EXPERIENCED LAW ENFORCEMENT

01:41:43.564 --> 01:41:45.666
INVESTIGATOR COULD LATERAL INTO

01:41:45.732 --> 01:41:47.034
OUR AGENCY.

01:41:47.100 --> 01:41:48.235
THE OTHER WHICH IS MORE OF THE

01:41:48.302 --> 01:41:49.736
ENTRY LEVEL POSITION THAT WE

01:41:49.803 --> 01:41:51.305
WOULD COMPETE WITH WITH LOCAL

01:41:51.371 --> 01:41:52.973
LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES WOULD

01:41:53.040 --> 01:41:54.475
BE SOMEBODY WITH A BACHELOR'S

01:41:54.541 --> 01:41:55.609
DEGREE WITH NO LAW ENFORCEMENT

01:41:55.676 --> 01:41:56.777
EXPERIENCE.

01:41:56.844 --> 01:41:57.911
WE CAN BRING THEM ON AND SEND

01:41:57.978 --> 01:41:59.580
THEM TO THROUGH A FULL POLICE

01:41:59.646 --> 01:42:00.781
ACADEMY.

01:42:00.848 --> 01:42:03.784
AND START THEM IN THE PROCESS AS

01:42:03.851 --> 01:42:04.384
AN INVESTIGATOR THROUGH THAT

01:42:04.451 --> 01:42:05.085
ROUTE.

01:42:05.152 --> 01:42:07.120
UNFORTUNATELY THAT IS OUR ENTRY

01:42:07.187 --> 01:42:09.389
LOWEST LEVEL POSITION AND IT

01:42:09.456 --> 01:42:11.325
PAYS FAR LESS THAN -- LOCAL LAW

01:42:11.391 --> 01:42:13.293
ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES FOR ENTRY

01:42:13.360 --> 01:42:15.829
LEVEL POSITIONS.

01:42:15.896 --> 01:42:19.333
THANK YOU MAKE MANAGER

01:42:19.399 --> 01:42:19.633
[inaudible]

01:42:19.700 --> 01:42:23.136
THE IT DOES SEEM WHEN WE LOOK AT

01:42:23.203 --> 01:42:24.671
THEM MATERIALS THAT THE WHILE

01:42:24.738 --> 01:42:28.542
THE BUDGET WELL THE LEGISLATURE

01:42:28.609 --> 01:42:29.743
APPROVED A BUDGET THAT DID.

01:42:29.810 --> 01:42:32.412
INCREASE FUNDING FOR

01:42:32.479 --> 01:42:33.413
IMPLEMENTATION OF APPS

01:42:33.480 --> 01:42:35.382
ENFORCEMENT AND INCREASE THE

01:42:35.449 --> 01:42:36.717
NUMBER OF POSITIONS.

01:42:36.783 --> 01:42:41.021
AS YOU'VE STATED YOU WERE ABLE.

01:42:41.088 --> 01:42:43.023
TO RETAIN OR YOU DIDN'T ACHIEVE

01:42:43.090 --> 01:42:47.027
THAT NUMBER OF POSITIONS SO.

01:42:47.094 --> 01:42:49.496
I GUESS THE WHAT.

01:42:49.563 --> 01:42:50.831
WHAT PART OF OUR QUESTION IS

01:42:50.898 --> 01:42:53.033
TRYING TO GET AT IS IF IT REALLY

01:42:53.100 --> 01:42:56.770
IS A PROBLEM OF THE?

01:42:56.837 --> 01:43:02.409
SALARY -- THE STATE WIDE -- I

01:43:02.476 --> 01:43:03.810
FORGET WHAT THE WORD IS CAUGHT

01:43:03.877 --> 01:43:05.345
WHAT YOU KNOW WHEN THE SETTING

01:43:05.412 --> 01:43:07.447
OF THE SALARY THAT ON THE STATE

01:43:07.514 --> 01:43:08.649
LIST.

01:43:08.715 --> 01:43:11.585
WHAT IT SET AT [inaudible]

01:43:11.652 --> 01:43:12.819
IS.

01:43:12.886 --> 01:43:13.921
ONE I GUESS WHY ISN'T THE

01:43:13.987 --> 01:43:15.055
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE TALKING IN

01:43:15.122 --> 01:43:16.223
ADMINISTRATION ABOUT AN

01:43:16.290 --> 01:43:18.625
APPROPRIATE ADJUSTMENTS.

01:43:18.692 --> 01:43:20.460
BECAUSE YEAH CLASSIFICATION

01:43:20.527 --> 01:43:22.429
AFTERWARD THANK YOU THANK YOU

01:43:22.496 --> 01:43:23.997
CLASSIFICATION THANK YOU --

01:43:24.064 --> 01:43:27.668
CLASSIFICATION RIGHT BECAUSE WE

01:43:27.734 --> 01:43:28.468
END UP.

01:43:28.535 --> 01:43:31.371
PROVIDING ADDITIONAL POSITIONS

01:43:31.438 --> 01:43:33.073
THEY DON'T GET FILLED.

01:43:33.140 --> 01:43:35.342
BUT WE DON'T NECESSARILY EACH

01:43:35.409 --> 01:43:37.210
YEAR AS WE LOOK AT ALL RIGHT

01:43:37.277 --> 01:43:38.779
THERE STORY -- ACT LIKE THEY'RE

01:43:38.845 --> 01:43:40.681
STILL WORKLOAD SO WHEN WE HAD

01:43:40.747 --> 01:43:41.982
MORE POSITIONS BUT IT'S LIKE

01:43:42.049 --> 01:43:43.450
WE'RE ADDING POSITIONS ON TOP OF

01:43:43.517 --> 01:43:44.785
POSITIONS BUT POSITIONS ARE AN

01:43:44.851 --> 01:43:46.186
EVEN FELT SO WE DON'T REALLY

01:43:46.253 --> 01:43:47.654
EVEN KNOW.

01:43:47.721 --> 01:43:49.222
IF THE NUMBER OF POSITIONS WERE

01:43:49.289 --> 01:43:50.457
ADDING.

01:43:50.524 --> 01:43:51.758
ARE EITHER TOO MANY OR

01:43:51.825 --> 01:43:55.028
INADEQUATE OR ADEQUATE BECAUSE

01:43:55.095 --> 01:43:57.464
YOU DON'T HAVE THE THEM FULLY

01:43:57.531 --> 01:43:59.032
STAFFED YET FOR US TO MAKE ANY

01:43:59.099 --> 01:44:00.334
OF THAT KIND OF DETERMINATION SO

01:44:00.400 --> 01:44:01.702
IF THE PROBLEM IS THAT

01:44:01.768 --> 01:44:04.905
CLASSIFICATION.

01:44:04.972 --> 01:44:06.073
A MENTOR YOU YOU'VE YOU'VE

01:44:06.139 --> 01:44:07.240
ESSENTIALLY REPEAT WHAT I'VE

01:44:07.307 --> 01:44:08.675
SAID TO MY TEAM AND WE SAID TO

01:44:08.742 --> 01:44:09.876
THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE ON SEVERAL

01:44:09.943 --> 01:44:11.144
OCCASIONS AND THAT IS.

01:44:11.211 --> 01:44:13.013
IS THERE SOME WAY FOR US TO

01:44:13.080 --> 01:44:14.281
WORKING WITHIN THE REGIME WE

01:44:14.348 --> 01:44:15.983
HAVE AND PART OF IT IS SOMETHING.

01:44:16.049 --> 01:44:17.517
WE CAN'T DEAL WITH THAT DIRECTLY

01:44:17.584 --> 01:44:18.752
CAUSE IS THE COLLECTIVE

01:44:18.819 --> 01:44:19.820
BARGAINING PROCESS IS YOUR LAST

01:44:19.886 --> 01:44:21.388
VACATION IS AND YOU CAN GET THE

01:44:21.455 --> 01:44:22.856
CLASSIFICATIONS CAN'T GET

01:44:22.923 --> 01:44:24.992
ADJUSTED BY AND AND AND SO WE

01:44:25.058 --> 01:44:26.727
BASS IS THERE SOME WAY THAT WE

01:44:26.793 --> 01:44:27.194
COULD.

01:44:27.260 --> 01:44:28.862
CHANGE THE CLASSIFICATIONS FOR

01:44:28.929 --> 01:44:30.697
THESE POSITIONS SO THEY COULD BE

01:44:30.764 --> 01:44:32.499
AT A HIGHER LEVEL SO THAT WE WE

01:44:32.566 --> 01:44:34.701
COULD COMPETE. FOR SOME OF THE

01:44:34.768 --> 01:44:36.036
PEOPLE MIGHT WANT TO COME AND

01:44:36.103 --> 01:44:38.372
WORK WITH US BUT IF THEY'RE AT

01:44:38.438 --> 01:44:39.373
THOSE LOWER CATEGORIES IT DOES

01:44:39.439 --> 01:44:40.607
MAKE IT DIFFICULT THE OTHER

01:44:40.674 --> 01:44:41.708
THING THAT I THINK MADE IT

01:44:41.775 --> 01:44:42.943
DIFFICULT FOR US IF YOU'RE GOING

01:44:43.010 --> 01:44:47.214
BACK TO THAT. TWENTY THIRTEEN

01:44:47.280 --> 01:44:49.049
TWENTY FOURTEEN PERIOD WHEN.

01:44:49.116 --> 01:44:49.783
APARTMENT JUST GOT A A

01:44:49.850 --> 01:44:50.784
SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE IN FUNDING

01:44:50.851 --> 01:44:51.718
FOR THE APPS PROGRAM IS THAT IF

01:44:51.785 --> 01:44:52.719
YOU LOOK CLOSE YOU'LL FIND THAT

01:44:52.786 --> 01:44:53.987
MANY OF THOSE POSITIONS THAT WE

01:44:54.054 --> 01:44:55.055
WERE PROVIDED.

01:44:55.122 --> 01:44:56.523
WE'RE LIMITED TERM AND SO IF

01:44:56.590 --> 01:44:57.824
IT'S ALREADY DIFFICULT FOR US TO

01:44:57.891 --> 01:44:59.960
COMPETE BASED ON COMPENSATION

01:45:00.027 --> 01:45:01.628
WAGES AND GO AND PENSION AND

01:45:01.695 --> 01:45:02.796
BENEFITS.

01:45:02.863 --> 01:45:03.864
IT WAS EVEN MORE DIFFICULT IF

01:45:03.930 --> 01:45:04.931
YOU COULD DO WE COULD TELL UP

01:45:04.998 --> 01:45:06.299
AND BY THE WAY WE CAN ONLY GIVE

01:45:06.366 --> 01:45:07.668
YOU THIS POSITION FOR A YEAR SO.

01:45:07.734 --> 01:45:09.336
AND SO IT MADE IT REALLY TOUGH

01:45:09.403 --> 01:45:11.171
TO HIRE PEOPLE ON IT THAT'S WHY

01:45:11.238 --> 01:45:13.006
HAVING PERMANENT POSITIONS MAKES

01:45:13.073 --> 01:45:13.874
IT EASIER FOR US TO BRING FOLKS

01:45:13.940 --> 01:45:14.274
SAID.

01:45:14.341 --> 01:45:15.475
BECAUSE NO ONE'S GOING TO LEAVE

01:45:15.542 --> 01:45:17.177
A JOB THAT PAYS MORE GIVES A

01:45:17.244 --> 01:45:19.212
BETTER PENSION BENEFITS. TO KNOW

01:45:19.279 --> 01:45:22.482
THAT THEIR ONLY GET TO DO FOR A

01:45:22.549 --> 01:45:25.052
LIMITED PERIOD OF TIME.

01:45:25.118 --> 01:45:25.419
RIGHT SO.

01:45:25.485 --> 01:45:26.553
I AM BUT I DON'T WANT TO SOUND

01:45:26.620 --> 01:45:27.320
CONTRADICTORY THAT I'M IN FAVOR

01:45:27.387 --> 01:45:29.823
OF INCREASING GENERAL FUND AT AT

01:45:29.890 --> 01:45:31.825
ALLOCATION HEARING YET I THINK

01:45:31.892 --> 01:45:34.227
THAT HE IF WE HAD A BETTER

01:45:34.294 --> 01:45:38.565
HANDLE ON WHAT IS THE RIGHT

01:45:38.632 --> 01:45:40.801
CLASSIFICATION SALARY TO RETAIN

01:45:40.867 --> 01:45:41.868
THE POSITIONS.

01:45:41.935 --> 01:45:44.304
WE MIGHT THEN WHILE WE MIGHT SEE

01:45:44.371 --> 01:45:46.139
AN INCREASE INITIALLY WE MIGHT

01:45:46.206 --> 01:45:47.040
END UP.

01:45:47.107 --> 01:45:49.910
NOT HAVING AS MUCH.

01:45:49.976 --> 01:45:52.045
THE SAME NUMBER OF FTP NEED OVER

01:45:52.112 --> 01:45:53.880
TIME TO MEET THE WORKLOAD

01:45:53.947 --> 01:45:55.682
BECAUSE THE F. T. E. WILL.

01:45:55.749 --> 01:45:58.251
BE FELT WHICH IS THE SITUATION

01:45:58.318 --> 01:45:59.653
WE'RE IN NOW IS IT'S NOT EVEN

01:45:59.720 --> 01:46:01.521
FILLED SO IT'S VERY VERY HARD TO

01:46:01.588 --> 01:46:02.989
DETERMINE WHAT THE REAL.

01:46:03.056 --> 01:46:05.025
WORK LOAD IS THE STAFF LEVEL

01:46:05.092 --> 01:46:06.426
OUTPUT FOR THE WORKPLACE IN

01:46:06.493 --> 01:46:08.495
STATE WE HAVEN'T EVEN FOR SHORT

01:46:08.562 --> 01:46:12.666
[inaudible] ONE FIVE BUT WE'RE

01:46:12.733 --> 01:46:14.901
GOING TO HOLD THIS ITEM OPEN.

01:46:14.968 --> 01:46:16.136
IN ADDITION TO THE BC PLEASE

YOUR HAVE SUBMITTED THERE ARE A

01:46:18.205 --> 01:46:20.674
NUMBER OF BILLS GOING THROUGH

01:46:20.741 --> 01:46:22.442
THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS RIGHT

01:46:22.509 --> 01:46:27.114
NOW THE MAYOR MAY NOT HAVE A A

01:46:27.180 --> 01:46:30.917
FACTOR IN INFLUENCE ON EITHER

01:46:30.984 --> 01:46:32.352
THE WAY WE MIGHT UTILIZE.

01:46:32.419 --> 01:46:34.121
LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT TO ASSIST

01:46:34.187 --> 01:46:35.889
US IN THIS PROCESS OR OTHER

01:46:35.956 --> 01:46:39.025
ASPECTS THAT MAY INFORMED THAN

01:46:39.092 --> 01:46:40.794
WHAT WE DO.

01:46:40.861 --> 01:46:43.797
FINALLY ON THIS BUDGET.

01:46:43.864 --> 01:46:45.766
ANY OTHER.

01:46:45.832 --> 01:46:47.834
OKAY CENTER ABOUT JUST -- I'VE

I'VE BEEN ON THE COMMITTEE

01:46:55.942 --> 01:46:56.243
LONGEST.

01:46:56.309 --> 01:46:57.744
AND WE'VE HEARD THIS OVER AND

REDUCE THE BACKLOG AND WE'RE

01:47:13.860 --> 01:47:15.462
GOING THROUGH THIS KIND OF LIKE

01:47:15.529 --> 01:47:16.830
OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN.

01:47:16.897 --> 01:47:19.800
AT THE END.

01:47:19.866 --> 01:47:21.535
OF YOU KNOW WE HAVE A LOT OF

01:47:21.601 --> 01:47:23.804
VACANCIES BECAUSE WE CAN'T HIRE

01:47:23.870 --> 01:47:25.105
THE SAME THING WITH YOUR YEAR

01:47:25.172 --> 01:47:26.706
IT'S ALWAYS THE SAME THING

01:47:26.773 --> 01:47:27.007
[inaudible]

01:47:27.073 --> 01:47:28.842
WHAT [inaudible]

01:47:28.909 --> 01:47:32.279
I PERCY I PERCEIVE THE MODEL YOU

01:47:32.345 --> 01:47:37.050
USE. TO ACCOMPLISH THIS TASK.

01:47:37.117 --> 01:47:39.052
IS NOT THE RIGHT MODEL.

01:47:39.119 --> 01:47:40.720
YOU HAVE TO REINVENT YOUR MODEL

01:47:40.787 --> 01:47:43.657
LOOK AT MAYBE SOME OTHER WAYS OF

01:47:43.723 --> 01:47:46.092
REDUCING THE NUMBER OF GUNS ARE

01:47:46.159 --> 01:47:47.894
OUT THERE MAYBE -- TECHNOLOGY

01:47:47.961 --> 01:47:49.563
TEAM.

01:47:49.629 --> 01:47:51.364
OF YOU KNOW THERE MIGHT BE YOU

01:47:51.431 --> 01:47:53.133
KNOW IT'S LIKE SOME REINVENTION

01:47:53.200 --> 01:47:54.868
OF SOME NEW.

01:47:54.935 --> 01:47:57.737
MODEL TO SOLVE YOUR PROBLEM I'D

01:47:57.804 --> 01:48:00.507
BE HAPPY TO TO SUPPORT.

01:48:00.574 --> 01:48:02.242
IF YOU HAD A DIFFERENT DIRECTION

01:48:02.309 --> 01:48:03.643
I THINK THE SAME DIRECTION I

01:48:03.710 --> 01:48:05.212
HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT I MEAN

01:48:05.278 --> 01:48:07.280
I CAN'T.

01:48:07.347 --> 01:48:08.748
JUST EVERY YEAR UNTIL I LEAVE

01:48:08.815 --> 01:48:12.018
YOUR DO THE SAME THING I MEAN

01:48:12.085 --> 01:48:14.054
THAT'S THAT'S KIND OF NOT.

01:48:14.120 --> 01:48:15.422
APPROPRIATE I THINK.

01:48:15.488 --> 01:48:17.190
OF THIS ISN'T WORKING SO SO

01:48:17.257 --> 01:48:19.492
YOU'RE.

01:48:19.559 --> 01:48:22.028
EVERY YEAR THERE'S YOU KNOW THE

01:48:22.095 --> 01:48:24.431
SAME NUMBER YOU HAVE X. AMOUNT

01:48:24.497 --> 01:48:26.099
COMING IN X. AMOUNT GOING OUT

01:48:26.166 --> 01:48:27.334
YOU KNOW.

01:48:27.400 --> 01:48:34.841
YEAH -- THE PROHIBITED LIST OF

01:48:34.908 --> 01:48:36.076
YOU KNOW WE HAVE TO HAVE SOME

01:48:36.142 --> 01:48:38.678
VERY BASIC WAY OF OF RUNNING

01:48:38.745 --> 01:48:40.847
THAT BETTER.

01:48:40.914 --> 01:48:43.116
YOU KNOW MAYBE START IN THE

01:48:43.183 --> 01:48:44.651
BEGINNING WHERE THEY FIRST GET

01:48:44.718 --> 01:48:46.319
ON THERE FOR HIM LISTEN GO BACK

01:48:46.386 --> 01:48:48.054
FURTHER.

01:48:48.121 --> 01:48:48.889
TRY TO KEEP THEM FROM GETTING ON

01:48:48.955 --> 01:48:51.892
THE LIST A REDUCING.

01:48:51.958 --> 01:48:54.294
THOSE PEOPLE THERE'S OTHER.

01:48:54.361 --> 01:48:56.963
I. T. WAYS OF DOING IT I THINK

01:48:57.030 --> 01:48:58.999
SO IT I I THINK.

01:48:59.065 --> 01:49:00.367
I THINK YOU'RE IN MAYBE MAYBE

01:49:00.433 --> 01:49:02.369
YOU HAVE THE WRONG GROUP OF

01:49:02.435 --> 01:49:06.139
STAFF MAYBE YOU IN THE PEOPLE

01:49:06.206 --> 01:49:08.575
THAT CAN ASSIST YOUR LAW

01:49:08.642 --> 01:49:10.510
ENFORCEMENT PEOPLE MORE MAYBE A

01:49:10.577 --> 01:49:12.078
OF THE LOWER LEVELS THE TECH

01:49:12.145 --> 01:49:14.080
TEAM.

01:49:14.147 --> 01:49:15.682
THAT DOES THE ASSISTANT OR THE

01:49:15.749 --> 01:49:19.753
LAW ENFORCEMENT I AM I AM

01:49:19.819 --> 01:49:21.821
CONVINCED THAT.

01:49:21.888 --> 01:49:24.858
WE NEED TO REINVENT THIS.

01:49:24.925 --> 01:49:27.060
PROCESS IN YOUR TEAM TO MAKE IT

01:49:27.127 --> 01:49:29.329
WORK EFFECTIVELY.

01:49:29.396 --> 01:49:31.097
OF THE WEATHER REASONS WHY IS

01:49:31.164 --> 01:49:32.999
YOU KNOW WE YOU KNOW SO SOMEBODY

01:49:33.066 --> 01:49:34.734
GETS ON THE LIST AND THEN

01:49:34.801 --> 01:49:36.403
THERE'S TOO MUCH TIME.

01:49:36.469 --> 01:49:39.839
BEFORE THEIR CHECK IN GUNS ARE

01:49:39.906 --> 01:49:42.409
TAKEN AWAY IS JUST IS LIKE

01:49:42.475 --> 01:49:42.709
[inaudible]

01:49:42.776 --> 01:49:45.946
SELECT DMV.

01:49:46.012 --> 01:49:48.248
THE WATER REDUCE THE WAIT TIME

01:49:48.315 --> 01:49:49.249
YOU KNOW.

01:49:49.316 --> 01:49:51.051
SO SO YOU KNOW IT AND IF IS THE

01:49:51.117 --> 01:49:54.220
SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE DOESN'T WORK.

01:49:54.287 --> 01:49:56.389
IF -- WE HAVE TO KIND OF

01:49:56.456 --> 01:49:58.058
REINVENT THE SYSTEM WE HAVE TO

01:49:58.124 --> 01:50:02.462
HAVE A SO THAT'S I DON'T KNOW IF --

01:50:02.529 --> 01:50:05.198
IF IN THE MID.

01:50:05.265 --> 01:50:06.700
THE TIME IT TAKES.

01:50:06.766 --> 01:50:09.869
IF WE CAN HAVE SOME.

01:50:09.936 --> 01:50:12.272
IDEAS THAT COULD.

01:50:12.339 --> 01:50:14.040
WORK BETTER ON THE WAY WE'RE

01:50:14.107 --> 01:50:14.708
DOING IT NOW BECAUSE I'M KIND OF

01:50:14.774 --> 01:50:15.442
HARD.

01:50:15.508 --> 01:50:17.077
PRESSED TO JUST THROW MORE MONEY

01:50:17.143 --> 01:50:18.845
AT IT I MEAN THAT'S I'M NOT I'M

01:50:18.912 --> 01:50:21.514
NOT.

01:50:21.581 --> 01:50:24.918
THAT'S DOES MARTIN IN A LONG

01:50:24.985 --> 01:50:27.387
TIME RIGHT THE SAME.

01:50:27.454 --> 01:50:28.588
JENNIFER COULD YES YOU MAY THANK

01:50:28.655 --> 01:50:32.392
YOU MANAGER. FIVE RESPOND --

01:50:32.459 --> 01:50:33.927
WHAT YOU JUST SAID I ESSENTIALLY

01:50:33.994 --> 01:50:35.595
SAID ABOUT A YEAR AGO TO OUR TO

01:50:35.662 --> 01:50:36.629
THEIR TEAM I SAID?

01:50:36.696 --> 01:50:38.431
WE WE CAN'T EVEN.

01:50:38.498 --> 01:50:40.400
TALK ABOUT NUMBERS AND AND HAVE

01:50:40.467 --> 01:50:42.202
PEOPLE AGREE WITH WHAT OUR

01:50:42.268 --> 01:50:43.436
NUMBERS REFLECT.

01:50:43.503 --> 01:50:45.372
SO WE SORT OF STRIP EVERYTHING

01:50:45.438 --> 01:50:46.706
DOWN INSTEAD OF MORE LIKE WAS

01:50:46.773 --> 01:50:48.041
GOOD ENOUGH TO TO GO THROUGH

01:50:48.108 --> 01:50:50.377
THIS WITH US WHEN WE ISSUED A

01:50:50.443 --> 01:50:51.077
REPORT.

01:50:51.144 --> 01:50:51.778
WE WENT THROUGH AND STRIPPED

01:50:51.845 --> 01:50:54.914
DOWN BECAUSE WHAT BACK WINNER

01:50:54.981 --> 01:50:56.816
BACKLOG CASES -- THERE WAS NEVER

01:50:56.883 --> 01:50:57.984
EVEN A DEFINITION OF WHAT WE

01:50:58.051 --> 01:50:59.919
CONSIDER THE BACKLOG AND SO WHAT

01:50:59.986 --> 01:51:02.322
WE'VE TRIED TO DO IS ONE WE TRY

01:51:02.389 --> 01:51:04.557
TO CLEAR THE DECKS AND MAKE IT

01:51:04.624 --> 01:51:05.625
CLEAR WHAT WE'RE DOING.

01:51:05.692 --> 01:51:07.360
SO WE'VE IDENTIFIED THE VARIOUS

01:51:07.427 --> 01:51:09.396
PEOPLE WHO SIT IN THE APPS

01:51:09.462 --> 01:51:10.730
PROGRAM AND WHY.

01:51:10.797 --> 01:51:12.298
BUT TO YOUR POINT OF TRYING TO

01:51:12.365 --> 01:51:13.733
MAKE THIS WORK BETTER WE WE

01:51:13.800 --> 01:51:15.535
THINK WE IN THE PROCESS FIGURED

01:51:15.602 --> 01:51:16.903
OUT.

01:51:16.970 --> 01:51:17.837
WHAT WE SOME OF THESE WE NEED TO

01:51:17.904 --> 01:51:19.706
DO AT FIRST I THINK THE THE

01:51:19.773 --> 01:51:20.473
PERSONAL DOING A?

01:51:20.540 --> 01:51:22.375
PHENOMENAL -- THESE MEN AND

01:51:22.442 --> 01:51:24.010
WOMEN WHO GO OUT THERE NEVER

01:51:24.077 --> 01:51:25.712
ONCE IN THE TEN OR SO YEARS THAT

01:51:25.779 --> 01:51:26.980
WE'VE BEEN OPERATING.

01:51:27.047 --> 01:51:28.014
HAS THERE BEEN AN INCIDENT AND

01:51:28.081 --> 01:51:29.015
MORE THAN EIGHTY THOUSAND

01:51:29.082 --> 01:51:30.417
WEAPONS HAVE BEEN CONFISCATED

01:51:30.483 --> 01:51:31.851
NEVER ONCE HAS ANYONE GOT HURT.

01:51:31.918 --> 01:51:33.253
WE DON'T TYPICALLY GO IN WITH

01:51:33.319 --> 01:51:35.755
WARRANTS WE HAVE TO ASK.

01:51:35.822 --> 01:51:37.490
AND WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO GET FOLKS

01:51:37.557 --> 01:51:38.992

01:51:39.059 --> 01:51:42.462
PROSECUTIONS LIKE THIS THE THE

01:51:42.529 --> 01:51:44.130
CASE IMAGINE AND ONLY COUNTY BUT

01:51:44.197 --> 01:51:45.398
AS I MENTIONED TO CENTER MORE.

01:51:45.465 --> 01:51:46.032
THERE ARE THREE THINGS THAT WE

01:51:46.099 --> 01:51:47.167
IDENTIFIED CLEARLY THAT WE COULD

01:51:47.233 --> 01:51:49.169
DO RIGHT AWAY AND AND SOME OF IT

01:51:49.235 --> 01:51:52.839
WE NEED YOUR HELP WITH SOME A WE

01:51:52.906 --> 01:51:53.039

WANT.

01:51:54.140 --> 01:51:54.707
THE COORDINATING WITH LOCAL LAW

01:51:54.774 --> 01:51:55.308
ENFORCEMENT SO THAT WE'RE NOT

AND THAT'S WHERE THE COOPERATION

01:52:55.068 --> 01:52:57.203
WOULD REALLY HAVE AS BEFORE MORE

01:52:57.270 --> 01:52:59.139
EFFICIENT AT THE FRONT END.

01:52:59.205 --> 01:53:01.074

HAVING THEM INCORPORATED WITHIN

01:53:14.354 --> 01:53:15.054
THEIR SYSTEM OF WHAT THEY'RE

01:53:15.121 --> 01:53:17.157

TAKE A LITTLE MONEY FOR THEM TO

01:53:19.092 --> 01:53:21.161
DO THAT BUT WE JUST DID HAVE

01:53:21.227 --> 01:53:23.596
BETTER COURT COORDINATION.

01:53:23.663 --> 01:53:26.799
AND MAKING SURE.

01:53:26.866 --> 01:53:28.134

01:53:43.550 --> 01:53:47.754
OF ORDERS -- RESTRAINING ORDERS

01:53:47.820 --> 01:53:48.888

01:53:48.955 --> 01:53:49.923
ABILITY TO GO IN THERE AND

01:53:49.989 --> 01:53:54.093

SENTENCE.

01:54:09.375 --> 01:54:12.011
THAT COULD BE THE THE TIME YOU

ONLY THE MEMBERS OF THIS

01:55:41.267 --> 01:55:42.635
SUBCOMMITTEE BUT YOU'VE HEARD

01:55:42.702 --> 01:55:44.937

APPLICATION OF THE NEW LAW.

01:57:34.747 --> 01:57:36.215
A REQUEST FOR RECORDS MAINTAINED

01:57:36.282 --> 01:57:39.619
BY ANY AGENCY NECESSARILY OCCURS

01:57:39.685 --> 01:57:42.555
AFTER THE LOSS EFFECTIVE DATE.

01:57:42.622 --> 01:57:43.222

WAS NOT A RULING ON THE MERITS

01:57:51.164 --> 01:57:53.065
THAT WAS A RULING ON THE

01:57:53.132 --> 01:57:57.503
PETITION FOR A STAY.

01:57:57.570 --> 01:57:58.137

01:57:59.505 --> 01:58:01.374
WILL BE ABLE TO FIND ADDITIONAL

01:58:01.441 --> 01:58:03.209
LAWS THAT WERE ENACTED BY THE

STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT HAD

01:58:04.644 --> 01:58:07.513

THEM BUT NOTHING.

01:58:23.463 --> 01:58:25.131
BUT UNTIL THE COURTS FINALLY

01:58:25.198 --> 01:58:29.802
ACTED PREVENTED ANY ENTITY FROM.

01:58:29.869 --> 01:58:30.770
FOLLOWING THE LAW AS IT WAS

01:58:30.837 --> 01:58:32.638
PASSED BEFORE THE COURT

01:58:32.705 --> 01:58:35.007
BASICALLY RULED ON THE MERITS TO

NOT UPHOLD THE LAW WHICH AS YOU

01:58:37.410 --> 01:58:38.811

01:58:38.878 --> 01:58:40.980

01:58:41.047 --> 01:58:42.582
TO UPHOLD IT NO COURT HAS RULED

01:58:42.648 --> 01:58:47.520

02:01:24.810 --> 02:01:25.578
FOOTAGE.

02:01:25.645 --> 02:01:28.381

02:01:28.447 --> 02:01:30.016
CERTAIN INFORMATION THAT.

02:01:30.082 --> 02:01:32.184
AND IN ON ON OUR CASES IT'S IT'S

02:01:32.251 --> 02:01:33.552
VERY DIFFERENT FROM A LOCAL LAW

02:01:33.619 --> 02:01:35.021
ENFORCEMENT AGENCY MAYBE PATROL

02:01:35.087 --> 02:01:36.455
YOU MIGHT HAVE ONE PERSON OR TWO

02:01:36.522 --> 02:01:37.423
PEOPLE AT AN INCIDENT OR

02:01:37.490 --> 02:01:38.357
SOMETHING OCCURS.

02:01:38.424 --> 02:01:40.326
WE TYPICALLY HAVE THREE TO SIX

02:01:40.393 --> 02:01:41.494
PEOPLE SO YOU HAVE CAMERAS ON

02:01:41.560 --> 02:01:43.162
EVERYBODY'S SOUL REQUIRE THE

02:01:43.229 --> 02:01:44.330
REVIEW OF ALL OF THOSE VIDEO

02:01:44.397 --> 02:01:45.531
FOOTAGE.

02:01:45.598 --> 02:01:50.069
ITEMS AND REDUCTION AND SO FORTH.

02:01:50.136 --> 02:01:51.003
THOUGH IT IS FOR A VERY LIMITED

02:01:51.070 --> 02:01:52.138
SET OF ITS ONLY COMPLETED

02:01:52.204 --> 02:01:57.677
INVESTIGATIONS OF SUSTAINED.

02:01:57.743 --> 02:02:00.079
INCIDENTS OF TAMPERING WITH.

02:02:00.146 --> 02:02:02.381
EVIDENCE WITNESS INTERFERENCE.

02:02:02.448 --> 02:02:07.119
ON SEXUAL ASSAULT ON THE JOB.

02:02:07.186 --> 02:02:09.989
OR SO IN THOSE CASES.

02:02:10.056 --> 02:02:11.891
I WOULD IMAGINE AND AGAIN WE

02:02:11.957 --> 02:02:12.658
DON'T KNOW YET BECAUSE WE

02:02:12.725 --> 02:02:13.993
HAVEN'T SEEN THE RECORDS RELEASE

02:02:14.060 --> 02:02:15.061
BUT I WOULD.

02:02:15.127 --> 02:02:16.696
IMAGINE THAT THERE IS NOT THAT

02:02:16.762 --> 02:02:18.164
LARGE OF A NUMBER OF RECORDS

02:02:18.230 --> 02:02:20.966
WITHIN DO JEEZ DOJ'S POSITION

02:02:21.033 --> 02:02:22.301
RELATED TO THAT SORT OF THING.

02:02:22.368 --> 02:02:24.403
AND THE OTHER USE OF DEADLY

02:02:24.470 --> 02:02:25.905
FORCE.

02:02:25.971 --> 02:02:29.608
IS FORCE THAT MAY BE -- MIGHT BE

02:02:29.675 --> 02:02:31.243
SLIGHTLY LARGER AND THAT'S OF

02:02:31.310 --> 02:02:32.344
COURSE WHERE THE BODY CAM

02:02:32.411 --> 02:02:37.883
FOOTAGE WOULD CERTAINLY APPLY --

02:02:37.950 --> 02:02:39.752
BUT AGAIN WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO

02:02:39.819 --> 02:02:41.954
SEE.

02:02:42.021 --> 02:02:43.322
BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T SEEN WHAT

02:02:43.389 --> 02:02:44.990
RECORDS ARE YOU KNOW YOU MEAN

02:02:45.057 --> 02:02:46.892
YOUR POSSESSION DOUBT THAT WOULD

02:02:46.959 --> 02:02:48.861
GIVE US SOME SENSE THAT WOULD

02:02:48.928 --> 02:02:50.296
GIVE US AN INDICATOR OF WHAT

02:02:50.362 --> 02:02:53.966
MIGHT BE NORMAL ON GOING.

02:02:54.033 --> 02:02:55.768
SO IT'S HARD TO TO JUDGE.

02:02:55.835 --> 02:02:56.969
UNDERSTOOD AND AND AGAIN I THINK

02:02:57.036 --> 02:02:58.938

02:02:59.004 --> 02:03:00.139

02:07:57.970 --> 02:08:00.539
LEGISLATION -- AND WE'RE ASKING

02:08:00.606 --> 02:08:01.373

WE'RE GONNA BE THERE WAS THERE'S

02:08:08.113 --> 02:08:09.481
WORKLOAD ASSOCIATED WITH IT --

02:08:09.548 --> 02:08:11.417
AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE ASKING FOR

02:08:11.483 --> 02:08:12.317
THE RESOURCES [inaudible]

02:08:12.384 --> 02:08:19.792
OKAY -- LA -- I DIDN'T CALLING

02:08:19.858 --> 02:08:21.927
YOU AROUND APPS MOSTLY BECAUSE

02:08:21.994 --> 02:08:23.262
WE KNEW THAT WE WEREN'T ACTING

02:08:23.328 --> 02:08:24.930
AND WE KNEW THAT IT WAS GOING TO

02:08:24.997 --> 02:08:26.765
BE GREATLY REVISED BY THE TIME

02:08:26.832 --> 02:08:28.500
WE GOT IT BUT YOU CERTAINLY YOU

02:08:28.567 --> 02:08:30.536
HAD SOME COMMENTS ON THIS PLEASE

02:08:30.602 --> 02:08:33.205
PROCEED.

02:08:33.272 --> 02:08:34.039
LEE -- ANY DAILY WITH THE

02:08:34.106 --> 02:08:34.973
LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE

02:08:35.040 --> 02:08:36.575
RELATED TO THIS B. C. P. WE ARE

02:08:36.642 --> 02:08:38.677
RECOMMENDING -- TO YOUR LIMITED

02:08:38.744 --> 02:08:40.479
TERM FUNDING RATHER THAN ONGOING

02:08:40.546 --> 02:08:41.213
FUNDING IS REPLACED BY THE

02:08:41.280 --> 02:08:42.915
STATION AND WHEN WE LOOKED AT

02:08:42.981 --> 02:08:44.049
THE FOUR PIECES THE WORKLOAD

02:08:44.116 --> 02:08:45.017
THAT ARE LISTED AND GENDER

02:08:45.084 --> 02:08:46.919
BEFORE YOU -- WE THOUGHT THAT

02:08:46.985 --> 02:08:48.253
THE WORKLOAD WAS REALLY EITHER

02:08:48.320 --> 02:08:50.155
LIMITED TERM IN NATURE OR AT

02:08:50.222 --> 02:08:51.156
THAT THE WORKLOAD WAS UNCERTAIN

02:08:51.223 --> 02:08:52.958
BECAUSE A REALLY RELIED ON HOW

02:08:53.025 --> 02:08:54.226
PEOPLE WOULD REACT.

02:08:54.293 --> 02:08:55.427
ESSENTIALLY TO THE LEGISLATION

02:08:55.494 --> 02:08:56.795
AND SO LIMITED TERM FUNDING

02:08:56.862 --> 02:08:58.097
WOULD PROVIDE YOU DO WITH THE

02:08:58.163 --> 02:09:00.499
RESOURCES TO DO THE WORK BUT

02:09:00.566 --> 02:09:02.367
ALSO TO COLLECT INFORMATION ON

02:09:02.434 --> 02:09:04.036
THE ACTUAL WORKLOAD IMPACTS AND

02:09:04.103 --> 02:09:05.337
TO THE EXTENT ADDITIONAL

02:09:05.404 --> 02:09:06.205
RESOURCES ARE NEEDED IN THE

02:09:06.271 --> 02:09:06.705
FUTURE.

02:09:06.772 --> 02:09:08.006
LEGISLATURE WOULD THAT HAVE

02:09:08.073 --> 02:09:11.443
ACCESS TO THAT ACTUAL DATA THAT

02:09:11.510 --> 02:09:17.082
THEY CAN ACT ON I'M.

02:09:17.149 --> 02:09:19.017
AND OF COURSE WE JUST THE

02:09:19.084 --> 02:09:20.419
EXPERIENCE IN HEARD FROM THE

02:09:20.486 --> 02:09:22.020
FACT THAT BY OUR LIMITED TERM

02:09:22.087 --> 02:09:25.357
FINDING. FOR EXAMPLE IN THE APPS

02:09:25.424 --> 02:09:28.460
CASE WE WERE UNABLE TO SUSTAIN

02:09:28.527 --> 02:09:30.129
THE FOLKS THAT WE HIRED FOR AS

02:09:30.195 --> 02:09:31.330
LONG AS WE MIGHT HAVE INTENDED

02:09:31.396 --> 02:09:32.865
BECAUSE AS SOON AS THERE WAS A

02:09:32.931 --> 02:09:34.266
PERMANENT POSITION OPEN THEY

02:09:34.333 --> 02:09:35.934
MOVED OVER TO IT.

02:09:36.001 --> 02:09:37.870
SO I THINK WE'LL AND OBVIOUSLY

02:09:37.936 --> 02:09:39.738
HAVE TO LOOK AT THAT I AM I AM

02:09:39.805 --> 02:09:41.874
CERTAINLY THERE IS A NUMBER OF

02:09:41.940 --> 02:09:43.408
THE ITEMS THAT.

02:09:43.475 --> 02:09:45.077
WE HELD.

02:09:45.144 --> 02:09:48.280
ON THAT I FEEL WERE POTENTIALLY

02:09:48.347 --> 02:09:50.082
ONES THAT ABSOLUTELY SHOULD BE

02:09:50.149 --> 02:09:53.719
LIMITED TERM -- IN THIS ONE I

02:09:53.785 --> 02:09:55.654
THINK WE'LL I WOULD ENCOURAGE

02:09:55.721 --> 02:09:57.523
STAFF TO LOOK AT MORE TO SEE

02:09:57.589 --> 02:09:58.624
WHETHER THAT.

02:09:58.690 --> 02:10:02.594
WILL WORK IN WITHOUT AND THE

02:10:02.661 --> 02:10:04.329
UNINTENDED AND EXPECT YOU KNOW

02:10:04.396 --> 02:10:05.664
NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES.

02:10:05.731 --> 02:10:06.932
BUT IF YOU WANT TO MAKE ANY

02:10:06.999 --> 02:10:08.967
COMMENT YEAH MANAGER ON IN THE

02:10:09.034 --> 02:10:10.469
BACKGROUND ON THIS PROPOSAL IN

02:10:10.536 --> 02:10:11.136
THERE'S A THE OTHER PROPOSAL THE

02:10:11.203 --> 02:10:13.105
WRIST RELATES TO LEGISLATION THE

02:10:13.172 --> 02:10:14.773
DEPARTMENT JUSTICE HAS MANY ARE

02:10:14.840 --> 02:10:16.642
NUMEROUS BILLS THAT COME THROUGH --

02:10:16.708 --> 02:10:18.076
OFTENTIMES WITH VERY SMALL

02:10:18.143 --> 02:10:19.945
IMPACT -- BUT IT WE WENT BACK A

02:10:20.012 --> 02:10:21.246
YEAR AGO AND WE LOOK AT WHAT THE

02:10:21.313 --> 02:10:23.315
IMPACT OF TWENTY THIRTY BILLS

02:10:23.382 --> 02:10:24.650
PASSING THAT HAVE A MINOR IMPACT

02:10:24.716 --> 02:10:25.651
THERE WAS A COUPLE MILLION

02:10:25.717 --> 02:10:26.451
DOLLARS.

02:10:26.518 --> 02:10:28.187
AND SO WE'VE CHANGED OUR PROCESS --

02:10:28.253 --> 02:10:29.955
INTERNALLY TO IDENTIFY THESE UP

02:10:30.022 --> 02:10:30.923
FRONT WHEN THEY'RE GOING THROUGH

02:10:30.989 --> 02:10:33.158
THE APPROPRIATIONS PROCESS WE WE

02:10:33.225 --> 02:10:34.126
ARE YOU KNOW TAGGING THEM WITH

02:10:34.193 --> 02:10:35.260
THE SCHOOL IMPACT.

02:10:35.327 --> 02:10:36.361
AND THEN TO THE BEST WE CAN

02:10:36.428 --> 02:10:37.896
WE'RE PACKAGING THEM ONLY ASK

02:10:37.963 --> 02:10:40.199
FOR BUDGET RESOURCES -- SO THAT

02:10:40.265 --> 02:10:41.366
THAT'S WHAT'S IN THE BACKGROUND

02:10:41.433 --> 02:10:45.070
ON THIS OKAY.

02:10:45.137 --> 02:10:45.404
RESHAPED THAT.

02:10:45.470 --> 02:10:48.373
I'M.

02:10:48.440 --> 02:10:48.974
BERMAN FINANCE YOU DO NEED TO

02:10:49.041 --> 02:10:55.047
COMMENT OKAY ANY COMMENTS FOR MY

02:10:55.113 --> 02:10:56.348

YOUR LOOK AT LIKE CAN YOU ABSORB

02:10:59.551 --> 02:11:00.819
THIS AND WITHIN YOUR BUDGET

02:11:00.886 --> 02:11:01.119
[inaudible]

02:11:01.186 --> 02:11:04.590
MY COMMENT.

02:11:04.656 --> 02:11:08.627
SENATE BILL.

02:11:08.694 --> 02:11:10.529
ONE RICHARD PRYOR RIGHT.

02:11:10.596 --> 02:11:11.597
ALL RIGHT WILL NOW I PUBLIC

02:11:11.663 --> 02:11:11.997

02:11:12.064 --> 02:11:14.800
ONE ANYTHING ON ISSUE.

02:11:14.866 --> 02:11:16.235
SIXTEEN RIGHT WILL MOVE TO ISSUE

02:11:16.301 --> 02:11:18.337
SEVENTEEN THE DNA IDENTIFICATION

FUND REVENUE BACK FILL.

02:11:20.339 --> 02:11:22.474

INCLUDED A TWO YEAR BACK FILL

02:11:28.313 --> 02:11:30.315
AND SO THIS IS -- TO ENSURE THAT

02:11:30.382 --> 02:11:31.817
THE BACK FILL STAYS IN PLACE

02:11:31.883 --> 02:11:34.419
NEXT YEAR -- THAT ALSO I THINK

02:11:34.486 --> 02:11:36.021
THERE WAS A EQUIPMENT COMPONENT

02:11:36.088 --> 02:11:37.623
LAST YEAR THAT'S IN A SEPARATE

02:11:37.689 --> 02:11:39.925

SOMEONE FINGERPRINT FEES WHICH I

02:12:09.855 --> 02:12:13.992
THINK WE HAVE.

02:12:14.059 --> 02:12:18.764
WHERE WAS THAT?

02:12:18.830 --> 02:12:22.467
ONE THAT'S NOT ON OUR BET ON I

02:12:22.534 --> 02:12:23.869
GUESS BY.

02:12:23.935 --> 02:12:32.477
YOU KNOW WE WE DO YOU.

02:12:32.544 --> 02:12:34.146
THE PASSAGE OF PROP SIXTY NINE

02:12:34.212 --> 02:12:35.914
DID GIVE US.

02:12:35.981 --> 02:12:40.352
REVENUE FOR THIS PURPOSE -- AND

02:12:40.419 --> 02:12:43.422
IF I UNDERSTAND FROM THE

02:12:43.488 --> 02:12:45.357
BACKGROUND IMAGE IT'D BE.

02:12:45.424 --> 02:12:52.397
THAT THAT REVENUES BEEN DROPPING --

02:12:52.464 --> 02:12:53.765
THERE'S ALSO SOME DISCUSSION

02:12:53.832 --> 02:13:00.305
AROUND FORTY SEVEN BUT I AT THAT

02:13:00.372 --> 02:13:01.673
WOULD ALSO INDICATE TO ME THAT

02:13:01.740 --> 02:13:04.209
THERE IS A REDUCTION IN WORKLOAD.

02:13:04.276 --> 02:13:07.846
SO -- CAN YOU.

02:13:07.913 --> 02:13:09.147
TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT

02:13:09.214 --> 02:13:11.483
ABOUT YES WE KNOW THE REVENUES

02:13:11.550 --> 02:13:12.818
BEEN DROPPING [inaudible]

02:13:12.884 --> 02:13:16.288
BUT CAN CAN YOU JUST EXPLAIN WHY

02:13:16.355 --> 02:13:21.460
THE WE STILL HAVE THE SAME COSTS.

02:13:21.526 --> 02:13:22.561
ABSOLUTELY MANAGER THANK YOU I'M

02:13:22.627 --> 02:13:23.929
VERY MILLER I'M THE DIRECTOR OF

02:13:23.995 --> 02:13:26.732
THE GIRLFRIEND SIX SERVICES AND

02:13:26.798 --> 02:13:29.768
I I UNDERSTAND THAT -- IT WOULD

02:13:29.835 --> 02:13:30.836
SEEM LIKE.

02:13:30.902 --> 02:13:31.670
AS THERE WAS THIS DROP IN

02:13:31.737 --> 02:13:32.971
REVENUE THERE WAS A DROP AND

02:13:33.038 --> 02:13:34.706
WORK WELL NO NOT AT ALL DROPS IN

02:13:34.773 --> 02:13:36.742
REVIEWER SO SHE WAS DROPPING

02:13:36.808 --> 02:13:39.177
WORKLOAD BUT SOME ARE -- THE THE

02:13:39.244 --> 02:13:41.646
FACT IS WE HAVE AREAS THAT HAVE

02:13:41.713 --> 02:13:44.082
IN FACT SEEN SOME WORK LOAD

02:13:44.149 --> 02:13:45.484
REDUCTION BUT WE'VE ALSO SEEN

02:13:45.550 --> 02:13:47.152
AREAS THAT HAVE HAD WORKLOAD

02:13:47.219 --> 02:13:49.254
INCREASES AND A PERFECT EXAMPLE

02:13:49.321 --> 02:13:51.123
OF THAT IS -- THE SEXUAL ASSAULT

02:13:51.189 --> 02:13:52.824
CASES HAVE INCREASED

02:13:52.891 --> 02:13:53.625
DRAMATICALLY.

02:13:53.692 --> 02:13:55.660
AND SO WHILE WE SEE SOME OF

02:13:55.727 --> 02:13:57.062
THESE MINOR DRUG OFFENSES

02:13:57.129 --> 02:13:59.664
REDUCED WE DON'T NECESSARILY SEE

02:13:59.731 --> 02:14:02.300
CHANGES IN THE DNA WORKLOAD --

02:14:02.367 --> 02:14:05.237
IT ACTUALLY INCREASES -- MORE

02:14:05.303 --> 02:14:08.807
THAN THE REDUCTION.

02:14:08.874 --> 02:14:10.475
WHEN YOU SAY THE SEXUAL EVIDENCE

02:14:10.542 --> 02:14:13.211
SAW KID WORKLOAD HAS INCREASED?

02:14:13.278 --> 02:14:14.946
DO YOU MEAN THAT MORE LOCAL

02:14:15.013 --> 02:14:17.582
JURISDICTIONS ARE SENDING YOUR

02:14:17.649 --> 02:14:21.486
LAB -- EVIDENCE TO BE TESTED --

02:14:21.553 --> 02:14:24.322
THEY SEND IN MORE EVIDENCE EVERY

02:14:24.389 --> 02:14:26.491
YEAR WE SEE AN INCREASE IN THE

02:14:26.558 --> 02:14:27.592
DNA REQUEST OF A HAVE NOT JUST

02:14:27.659 --> 02:14:29.294
RELATED TO SEXUAL RIGHT BUT

02:14:29.361 --> 02:14:30.695

IN I BELIEVE WE DISCUSSED THIS

02:14:45.043 --> 02:14:46.578
LAST YEAR AS WELL -- THERE WAS A

02:14:46.645 --> 02:14:48.079
MISUNDERSTANDING BECAUSE I

02:14:48.146 --> 02:14:48.780
BELIEVE THERE ARE SOME

02:14:48.847 --> 02:14:50.482
JURISDICTIONS SUCH AS CONTRA

02:14:50.549 --> 02:14:52.217
COSTA AND ALAMEDA THAT HAVE

THEIR OWN LADDERS THAT HAVE

02:14:52.884 --> 02:14:54.085
THEIR OWN LABORATORIES.

02:14:54.152 --> 02:14:56.688
AS THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE WE

02:14:56.755 --> 02:14:57.322
DON'T CHARGE FOR THAT SERVICE AT

ONE WHICH COUNTIES HAVE FALLEN

02:15:07.466 --> 02:15:09.401
LABS THAT.

02:15:09.468 --> 02:15:11.503
NECESSITY -- TO USING THEIR

COUNTY LABS VERSES THESE THESE

02:15:13.472 --> 02:15:15.974
FACILITIES.

COUNTIES TO USE YOUR FACILITY

02:15:20.312 --> 02:15:21.646
OTHER COUNTIES NOT USING A

MA'AM SKINNER AND I JUST TALKED

02:20:33.992 --> 02:20:35.059

02:20:37.162 --> 02:20:38.663
SERVICES SUCH AS CONTRA COSTA

02:20:38.730 --> 02:20:40.131
CONTRA COSTA COUNTY DOES CHARGE

02:20:40.198 --> 02:20:41.833
IT'S LOCALS FOR ITS SERVICES BUT

02:20:41.900 --> 02:20:43.902
MOST OF THOSE COUNTIES ARE RUN

02:20:43.968 --> 02:20:45.170
THROUGH EITHER SHERIFF'S OFFICER

02:20:45.236 --> 02:20:46.504
DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE

02:20:46.571 --> 02:20:47.939
THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY FROM THEIR

02:20:48.006 --> 02:20:49.808
LOCAL GOVERNMENT JUST LIKE WE'RE

THE STATE GOVERNMENT AND THEY

02:20:51.543 --> 02:20:52.443
DON'T CHARGE THEIR LOCAL

02:20:52.510 --> 02:20:54.345
AGENCIES TO DO THE WORK THAT

02:20:54.412 --> 02:20:54.679
THEY'RE DOING.

02:20:54.746 --> 02:20:55.880
RIGHT.

02:20:55.947 --> 02:20:57.649
SO -- IT'S A MATTER OF THEIR

02:20:57.715 --> 02:20:59.150
ECONOMIC MODEL IS THE SAME AS

02:20:59.217 --> 02:21:01.286
OURS WHEN IT COMES TO THE FACT

02:21:01.352 --> 02:21:02.620
THEY'RE PROVIDING THE SERVICES

02:21:02.687 --> 02:21:04.622
FOR THEIR COUNTY BECAUSE THEY

02:21:04.689 --> 02:21:05.790
WANT TO GET THAT WORK DONE.

02:21:05.857 --> 02:21:08.393
WHEN WHEN -- THE DEPARTMENT OF

02:21:08.459 --> 02:21:10.762
JUSTICE REGIONAL IZED AND WENT

02:21:10.829 --> 02:21:11.729
TO ITS.

02:21:11.796 --> 02:21:12.297
BOTTLE OF HAVING THE

02:21:12.363 --> 02:21:13.498
LABORATORIES IN LOCATIONS IT DID

02:21:13.565 --> 02:21:14.866
IT DID THAT BASED ON THE FACT

02:21:14.933 --> 02:21:16.134
THAT THEY DID NOT HAVE THE

02:21:16.201 --> 02:21:17.435
RESOURCES TO HAVE FORENSIC

02:21:17.502 --> 02:21:20.171
SERVICES.

02:21:20.238 --> 02:21:22.941
SO THOSE LOCALITIES DO THE SAME

02:21:23.007 --> 02:21:24.976
ECONOMIC MODEL YEARS AT THREE

02:21:25.043 --> 02:21:27.345
YEARS THREE YEARS OF WE CHARGE

02:21:27.412 --> 02:21:28.079

02:21:28.446 --> 02:21:29.380
IN HEAVEN.

02:21:29.447 --> 02:21:32.483
THEIR DESIRE TO USE THE SERVICES.

02:21:32.550 --> 02:21:35.019
YES OKAY SO WHERE IS THE PROOF

02:21:35.086 --> 02:21:37.188
OF THAT.

02:21:37.255 --> 02:21:37.789

OPPORTUNITY TO RUN THAT BECAUSE

02:21:57.742 --> 02:21:58.910
THEY WERE TRYING TO SELL.

02:21:58.977 --> 02:22:00.445

02:22:01.779 --> 02:22:03.648
STUPID THING TO SAY BECAUSE IT

02:22:03.715 --> 02:22:05.750
YET THE PROOF THE PROOF WOULD BE

02:22:05.817 --> 02:22:07.385
THE PREFERRED BE THAT THEY DID

02:22:07.452 --> 02:22:10.855
NOT DO IT BECAUSE OF A FEE IS

02:22:10.922 --> 02:22:12.957
WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.

02:22:13.024 --> 02:22:14.058
NOT BECAUSE OF THEIR OWN

02:22:14.125 --> 02:22:19.330
INCOMPETENCE OF NOT GIVING

02:22:19.397 --> 02:22:20.865
EVIDENCE WILL.

02:22:20.932 --> 02:22:21.766
ABSOLUTELY IF I IF I GO OUT TO

02:22:21.833 --> 02:22:22.667
HUMBLE COUNTY AND I DECIDED O

02:22:22.734 --> 02:22:23.268
TRY AND CHARGE THEM FOR EVERY

02:22:23.334 --> 02:22:23.868
PIECE OF EVIDENCE THAT I WORK

02:22:23.935 --> 02:22:24.469
FOR THEM THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE

02:22:24.535 --> 02:22:25.103
TO DECIDE WHAT'S BEST FOR THEIR

02:22:25.169 --> 02:22:26.004
BUDGET.

02:22:26.070 --> 02:22:27.538
AND I THINK THAT'S A MATTER OF

02:22:27.605 --> 02:22:30.275
LOGIC NOT NECESSARILY MATTER

02:22:30.341 --> 02:22:30.508
THEORY.

02:22:30.575 --> 02:22:32.310
ALL RIGHT.

02:22:32.377 --> 02:22:35.013
ALL RIGHT WELL I'VE I'VE HEARD

02:22:35.079 --> 02:22:38.383
HEARD ENOUGH FROM YOU.

02:22:38.449 --> 02:22:40.485
NOT HERE A LITTLE BIT FOR ME

02:22:40.551 --> 02:22:42.086
YEAH I LOVED SO IT'S AN ORAL

02:22:42.153 --> 02:22:44.255
ANTI -- HAS TWO LABS.

02:22:44.322 --> 02:22:45.657
IT WAS A VERY DIFFICULT

02:22:45.723 --> 02:22:47.392
SITUATION WHEN I WAS A

02:22:47.458 --> 02:22:48.860
SUPERVISOR YEAH RIGHT AS THE

02:22:48.927 --> 02:22:53.298
SHERIFF HAD A LAB IN THE DA HAD

02:22:53.364 --> 02:22:53.865
A LAB [inaudible]

02:22:53.932 --> 02:22:57.435
AND THERE WERE JUST A A LOT OF

02:22:57.502 --> 02:22:57.902
UNIQUE HAVE POLITICAL

02:22:57.969 --> 02:22:59.971
CONSEQUENCES OF WHO SENT WHAT TO

02:23:00.038 --> 02:23:00.972
CODICE AND ALL THE REST AND IT

02:23:01.039 --> 02:23:02.340
WAS.

02:23:02.407 --> 02:23:05.076
AN UGLY LITTLE.

02:23:05.143 --> 02:23:06.744
A FAIR THAT I STEPPED INTO --

02:23:06.811 --> 02:23:08.079
WHEN I BECAME A SUPERVISOR OUR

02:23:08.146 --> 02:23:11.516
LAB WAS -- IN BIRMINGHAM ENGLAND

02:23:11.582 --> 02:23:13.985
FOR THE D. A. -- REAL

02:23:14.052 --> 02:23:15.787
INTERESTING.

02:23:15.853 --> 02:23:18.222
SITUATIONS ONE STORY BUT BUT WE

02:23:18.289 --> 02:23:20.024
HAD A SET UP KIND OF A SUB

02:23:20.091 --> 02:23:21.059
COMMITTEE.

02:23:21.125 --> 02:23:23.361
WITH THE CEO OF THE COUNTY THAT

02:23:23.428 --> 02:23:24.662
TRYING GET THE SHARE FOR THE D.

02:23:24.729 --> 02:23:25.330
A..

02:23:25.396 --> 02:23:27.231
YOU KNOW JUST TO COORDINATE HIS

02:23:27.298 --> 02:23:29.233
WHY.

02:23:29.300 --> 02:23:31.102
THEY EACH HAD THEIR TURFS RIGHT.

02:23:31.169 --> 02:23:34.405
IT GOT TO BE REALLY ACCURATE --

02:23:34.472 --> 02:23:35.740
BUT NOW THAT I'M NOT A

02:23:35.807 --> 02:23:37.608
SUPERVISOR JAMAICA DONE IT FOR

02:23:37.675 --> 02:23:40.211
FREE I CAN A FIRED EVERYBODY ALL

02:23:40.278 --> 02:23:43.715
RIGHT YOU.

02:23:43.781 --> 02:23:45.616
SO YOU HAVE THIS CHANNEL ABS.

02:23:45.683 --> 02:23:48.252
IT READS ARE SOLELY DOWN AND SO.

02:23:48.319 --> 02:23:50.221
YOU HAVE TEN REGIONAL

02:23:50.288 --> 02:23:50.788
LABORATORIES WHERE ARE THEY

02:23:50.855 --> 02:23:53.291
LOCATED IN.

02:23:53.358 --> 02:23:54.959
MY TEN REGIONAL EPITAPH.

02:23:55.026 --> 02:23:55.960
RICA REDDING CHICO SANTA ROSA

02:23:56.027 --> 02:23:59.130
SACRAMENTO -- FRESNO RIVERSIDE.

02:23:59.197 --> 02:24:00.431
RIBBON.

02:24:00.498 --> 02:24:01.599
SANTA BARBARA.

02:24:01.666 --> 02:24:03.434
AND SANTA CRUZ DOES THE

02:24:03.501 --> 02:24:05.169
REGIONALS AND THOSE WHO MANY AND

02:24:05.236 --> 02:24:07.505
JUST ONE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA --

02:24:07.572 --> 02:24:09.374
WELL RIVERSIDE SANTA BARBARA --

02:24:09.440 --> 02:24:12.143
IN SANTA BARBARA AND RIVERSIDE

02:24:12.210 --> 02:24:15.046
WERE OKAY WE'RE GOING TO CALL

02:24:15.113 --> 02:24:17.081
THAT OKAY.

02:24:17.148 --> 02:24:19.283
WHAT CLOSER IN BIRMINGHAM BUT --

02:24:19.350 --> 02:24:20.251
IT WAS VERY VERY A VERY STRANGE

02:24:20.318 --> 02:24:22.186
SITUATION.

02:24:22.253 --> 02:24:23.755
SO OBVIOUSLY LARGE COUNTIES HAVE

02:24:23.821 --> 02:24:24.389
D. A.'S AT HAVE COMMENCED THEIR

02:24:24.455 --> 02:24:25.556
BOARDS OF SUPERVISORS THAT THEY

02:24:25.623 --> 02:24:26.491
SHOULD HAVE THEIR OWN

02:24:26.557 --> 02:24:26.791
[inaudible]

02:24:26.858 --> 02:24:30.795
LABS -- AND THEN THERE'S ALSO

02:24:30.862 --> 02:24:32.997
THE THAT IN THE ISSUE WAS WHY

02:24:33.064 --> 02:24:33.664
SHOULD THE D. A. WHOSE

02:24:33.731 --> 02:24:33.965
[inaudible]

02:24:34.032 --> 02:24:35.299
PUSHING [inaudible]

02:24:35.366 --> 02:24:36.901
PUSHING THESE.

02:24:36.968 --> 02:24:39.537
CASES WHY SHOULD BABY ALSO.

02:24:39.604 --> 02:24:41.339
DURING THE DNA LIKE THERE'S A

02:24:41.406 --> 02:24:43.041
CONFLICT OF INTERESTS ARE YOU.

02:24:43.107 --> 02:24:45.777
HOW DO YOU RESOLVE CONFLICTS OF

02:24:45.843 --> 02:24:46.411
INTEREST?

02:24:46.477 --> 02:24:46.844
IS IT.

02:24:46.911 --> 02:24:48.446
WHAT IT WHAT CAN HAPPEN IS YOU

02:24:48.513 --> 02:24:50.548
CAN LIE?

02:24:50.615 --> 02:24:51.382
IS THERE WITH THE DNA SAYS THAT

02:24:51.449 --> 02:24:52.650
YOU'RE THE PERSON AND WHEN WHEN

02:24:52.717 --> 02:24:55.353
THAT IS NOT IN IN FACT THE CASE.

02:24:55.420 --> 02:24:57.622
HOW DO YOU PREVENT THAT KIND OF

02:24:57.688 --> 02:24:59.724
AGGRESSIVENESS BECAUSE I I HAD A

02:24:59.791 --> 02:25:01.259
DA THAT WANTED TO GET A 90%?

02:25:01.325 --> 02:25:02.326
CONVICTION RATE SO SOMETIMES YOU

02:25:02.393 --> 02:25:04.128
CAN JUST [inaudible]

02:25:04.195 --> 02:25:06.664
MOW DOWN.

02:25:06.731 --> 02:25:07.732
AND GET YOU KNOW FALSE

02:25:07.799 --> 02:25:09.000
COMPASSION OR WHATEVER HOW DO

02:25:09.067 --> 02:25:11.502
YOU PREVENT THAT FROM HAPPENING --

02:25:11.569 --> 02:25:12.904
AT SENATOR IF I UNDERSTAND YOUR

02:25:12.970 --> 02:25:14.872
QUESTION WE ARE NOT -- POLICE

02:25:14.939 --> 02:25:17.275
OFFICERS WERE NOT INVESTIGATORS

02:25:17.341 --> 02:25:20.745
WE RUN EVIDENCE AND PRODUCE

02:25:20.812 --> 02:25:22.613
SCIENTIFIC RESULTS WHAT THE

02:25:22.680 --> 02:25:24.816
INVESTIGATORS AND THE DISTRICT

02:25:24.882 --> 02:25:26.217
ATTORNEY'S DO WITH THAT.

02:25:26.284 --> 02:25:27.885
THAT'S THEIR PREROGATIVE HOW

02:25:27.952 --> 02:25:29.787
THEY USE THAT REPORT THAT WE

02:25:29.854 --> 02:25:31.389
HAVE GIVEN THEM SO.

02:25:31.456 --> 02:25:33.091
JUST TO CLARIFY.

02:25:33.157 --> 02:25:37.161
THE THE BUREAU OF FORENSIC

02:25:37.228 --> 02:25:39.730
SERVICES IS THAT AN INDEPENDENT

02:25:39.797 --> 02:25:41.432
AGENCY ARE YOU UNDERNEATH YOUR

02:25:41.499 --> 02:25:42.834
TRAIN GENERAL'S OFFICE WE'RE IN

02:25:42.900 --> 02:25:44.168
THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE

02:25:44.235 --> 02:25:45.970
OKAY SO THAT'S WHERE I'M.

02:25:46.037 --> 02:25:47.271
MAKING THE INFERENCE SO YOU'RE

02:25:47.338 --> 02:25:48.806
SAYING WERE IMBEDDED BUT WERE

02:25:48.873 --> 02:25:50.775
INDEPENDENT.

02:25:50.842 --> 02:25:53.444
AND WE'RE JUST PROVIDING.

02:25:53.511 --> 02:25:54.378
SCIENTIFIC DATA.

02:25:54.445 --> 02:25:56.280
NOT.

02:25:56.347 --> 02:25:58.716
MADE TO ORDER.

02:25:58.783 --> 02:26:00.651
BUT I'M BIASED THAT'S CORRECT.

02:26:00.718 --> 02:26:02.520
AT THAT'S ALL I WANTED THAT WAS

02:26:02.587 --> 02:26:04.188
THE QUESTION APOLOGIZE FOR

02:26:04.255 --> 02:26:05.089
UNDERSTANDING THANK YOU.

02:26:05.156 --> 02:26:05.957
I APOLOGIZE FOR NOT

02:26:06.023 --> 02:26:07.959
COMMUNICATING BUT WE WE JUST HAD

02:26:08.025 --> 02:26:09.560
SOME INCIDENTS THAT I WANT TO GO

02:26:09.627 --> 02:26:10.194
THROUGH ALL KINDS OF WAR STORIES

02:26:10.261 --> 02:26:13.030
BUT JUST WANTED TO CLARIFY THAT

02:26:13.097 --> 02:26:14.966
THANK YOU MANAGER [inaudible]

02:26:15.032 --> 02:26:16.167
CERTAINLY NOW.

02:26:16.234 --> 02:26:18.369
THE I THINK.

02:26:18.436 --> 02:26:21.172
WE WERE TOUCHING ON SOME ITEMS

02:26:21.239 --> 02:26:23.441
THAT IF WE LOOK AT JUST ONE

02:26:23.508 --> 02:26:24.742
EXAMPLE.

02:26:24.809 --> 02:26:26.410
THE WHOLE ISSUE AROUND.

02:26:26.477 --> 02:26:28.846
THE SEXUAL ASSAULT EVIDENCE THAT

02:26:28.913 --> 02:26:29.981
THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF

02:26:30.047 --> 02:26:31.883
FRUSTRATION AND LOTS OF

02:26:31.949 --> 02:26:34.352
DIFFERENT BILLS TO TRY.

02:26:34.418 --> 02:26:36.287
TO BOTH GET OUT BACKLOGS IN TO

02:26:36.354 --> 02:26:37.688
MAKE SURE THAT ALL SEXUAL

02:26:37.755 --> 02:26:39.957
ASSAULT EVIDENCE THE DNA IS

02:26:40.024 --> 02:26:42.160
EXTRACTED AND PUT IN A DATABASE.

02:26:42.226 --> 02:26:43.828
SO ONE OF THE ISSUES IS WE HAVE

02:26:43.895 --> 02:26:45.096
COUNTIES THAT.

02:26:45.163 --> 02:26:47.465
SEND THEIR MATERIALS TO THE

02:26:47.532 --> 02:26:49.867
STATE LAB IN EFFECT AT NO COST

02:26:49.934 --> 02:26:51.903
TO THE COUNTY.

02:26:51.969 --> 02:26:53.271
ON NOW SOME OF THE SOME OF THOSE

02:26:53.337 --> 02:26:54.839
COUNTIES WORDS SENDING IT ALL.

02:26:54.906 --> 02:26:57.275
BUT AT LEAST ONCE THE ISSUE WAS

02:26:57.341 --> 02:26:59.510
MORE REYES YOU SAW A LITTLE MORE

02:26:59.577 --> 02:27:00.978
BEING SENT FROM THOSE COUNTIES

02:27:01.045 --> 02:27:02.213
AND THEN YOU HAVE TO COUNTIES

02:27:02.280 --> 02:27:04.549
THEY HAVE THEIR OWN LABS WHERE.

02:27:04.615 --> 02:27:07.318
IN VERY OFTEN THAT LAB CHARGES

02:27:07.385 --> 02:27:09.987
THE LOCAL JURISDICTION IN THE

02:27:10.054 --> 02:27:10.421
COUNTY.

02:27:10.488 --> 02:27:12.456
SO THEN THAT.

02:27:12.523 --> 02:27:14.325
INTO TIAS MAY BE BECAUSE OF THE

02:27:14.392 --> 02:27:16.827
COST ISSUE LESS WILLING OR MORE

02:27:16.894 --> 02:27:18.696
SELECTIVE ABOUT WHAT THEY SEND

02:27:18.763 --> 02:27:20.898
WHICH WAS FOR YOURCONCERN.

02:27:20.965 --> 02:27:21.732
THAT THEN IF.

02:27:21.799 --> 02:27:24.835
THEN WE DON'T HAVE.

02:27:24.902 --> 02:27:26.671
FULL DATA BUT IT WOULD APPEAR

02:27:26.737 --> 02:27:28.739
THAT SOME PLACES LIKE THAT WHERE

02:27:28.806 --> 02:27:31.042
IT WAS A COST TO THEM.

02:27:31.108 --> 02:27:32.710
WOULD LEAVE THE EVIDENCE ON THE

02:27:32.777 --> 02:27:33.377
SHOPS.

02:27:33.444 --> 02:27:34.979
SO YOU KNOW WE OBVIOUSLY DON'T

02:27:35.046 --> 02:27:37.248
WANT THAT BUT NOW WE HAVE THIS

02:27:37.315 --> 02:27:39.684
KIND OF ODD SITUATION WHERE.

02:27:39.750 --> 02:27:42.153
WE KNOW THAT IT COSTS US MONEY.

02:27:42.220 --> 02:27:43.988
TO EXTRACT THE DNA AND GET IT

02:27:44.055 --> 02:27:45.056
INTO THAT.

02:27:45.122 --> 02:27:46.490
DATABASE.

02:27:46.557 --> 02:27:50.094
THERE'S A COST.

02:27:50.161 --> 02:27:52.196
BUT THEN WE'RE HAVE A ON LEVEL

02:27:52.263 --> 02:27:53.764
PLAYING FIELD IN TERMS OF WHO

02:27:53.831 --> 02:27:54.966
PAYS FOR IT.

02:27:55.032 --> 02:27:56.834
YES THE TAXPAYER ULTIMATELY PAYS

02:27:56.901 --> 02:27:58.836
FOR IT BUT IN SOME CASES IT'S

02:27:58.903 --> 02:28:01.906
THE STATE WIDE TAX PAYER PAYING

02:28:01.973 --> 02:28:03.441
FOR A WHOLE SET A COUNTIES AND

02:28:03.507 --> 02:28:05.676
IN OTHER CASES IT'S JUST THE

02:28:05.743 --> 02:28:06.944
LOCAL TAXPAYER.

02:28:07.011 --> 02:28:09.513
PAYING FOR IT JUST WITHIN THEIR

02:28:09.580 --> 02:28:10.314
COUNTY.

02:28:10.381 --> 02:28:14.151
AND THAT MAY BE.

02:28:14.218 --> 02:28:15.353
A BASIS FOR SOME OF OUR PROBLEM

02:28:15.419 --> 02:28:16.887
OF NOT.

02:28:16.954 --> 02:28:18.756
GETTING THIS EVIDENCE IN.

02:28:18.823 --> 02:28:21.826
SO BUT WE'RE WE'RE NOW POSED

02:28:21.892 --> 02:28:23.561
WASTE WITH JUST DEALING WITH HOW

02:28:23.628 --> 02:28:27.398
TO FILL THE STATE LAB BACK FILL

02:28:27.465 --> 02:28:29.033
IN NOT THE ENTIRE.

02:28:29.100 --> 02:28:33.571
STATEWIDE ISSUE ON BUT THIS DNA

02:28:33.638 --> 02:28:35.873
FEE THAT WE HAVE THERE IS SOME

02:28:35.940 --> 02:28:37.375
PORTION OF IT THAT IS GIVEN TO

02:28:37.441 --> 02:28:39.010
COUNTIES CORRECT.

02:28:39.076 --> 02:28:40.878
SO THE COUNTIES ARE SO WHILE

02:28:40.945 --> 02:28:42.346
THEY MAY NOT.

02:28:42.413 --> 02:28:44.548
GET ALL OF THE JUST THE SAME WAY

02:28:44.615 --> 02:28:46.317
YOU HAVE A BACKLOG SOME MONEY

02:28:46.384 --> 02:28:48.819
DOES GO TO THE COUNTIES.

02:28:48.886 --> 02:28:50.288
YES MA'AM IT'S THOSE WITH THEIR

02:28:50.354 --> 02:28:52.757

02:32:06.517 --> 02:32:07.952
ABOUT THE ACTIVITIES THE DOJ

02:32:08.018 --> 02:32:09.220
RELATED TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF

02:32:13.557 --> 02:32:23.467
ALL RIGHT I'M -- THIS IS CLEAR

02:32:23.534 --> 02:32:25.669

02:32:25.736 --> 02:32:28.873
LEGISLATION THAT THE LEGISLATURE.

02:32:28.939 --> 02:32:32.510
ENACTED SO IT DOES -- IT WILL

02:32:32.576 --> 02:32:33.377
REQUIRE.

02:32:33.444 --> 02:32:37.381
SOME AUGMENTATION -- FOR

02:32:37.448 --> 02:32:40.317
IMPLEMENTATION BUT LA -- I THINK

02:32:40.384 --> 02:32:42.152
YOUR COMMENT WAS NOT ON WHAT WAS

02:32:42.219 --> 02:32:45.422
THE REQUEST BUT RATHER WHAT

02:32:45.489 --> 02:32:48.559
DEFINES SOURCE WAS.

02:32:48.626 --> 02:32:50.694
CORRECT -- OF THE NEW THE THE

02:32:50.761 --> 02:32:52.062
LEGISLATION CREATED AND YOU FIND

02:32:52.129 --> 02:32:53.831
A CONSUMER PRIVACY.

02:32:53.898 --> 02:32:55.165
FIND AND SO WE ARE RECOMMENDING

02:32:55.232 --> 02:32:56.267
US OF A DRUG DIRECTOR

PREPARATION ALONE TO THAT FINE

02:32:57.468 --> 02:32:59.203
BECAUSE THAT FUND WAS CREATED BY

02:32:59.270 --> 02:33:00.704
STATE LAW TO RECEIVE.

02:33:00.771 --> 02:33:02.239
A CIVIL PENALTY REVENUES THAT

02:33:02.306 --> 02:33:04.174
WERE ASSESSED FOR VIOLATING THE

02:33:04.241 --> 02:33:06.076
LAW AND THE INTENSE WAS FULLY

02:33:06.143 --> 02:33:08.712
OFFSET DOJ'S COSTS OF

02:33:08.779 --> 02:33:10.047
IMPLEMENTATION AND ENFORCEMENT.

02:33:10.114 --> 02:33:10.848
AND SO.

02:33:10.915 --> 02:33:12.116
ALONE WOULD ENSURE THAT DOJ HAS

02:33:12.182 --> 02:33:13.551
A SUFFICIENT RESOURCES TO GET

02:33:13.617 --> 02:33:15.886
STARTED BUT WOULD ALSO COMPLY

02:33:15.953 --> 02:33:17.555
WITH LEGISLATIVE AND THE SECOND

02:33:17.621 --> 02:33:18.923
PART OF THAT IS.

02:33:18.989 --> 02:33:20.624
BY DOING THIS -- METHODOLOGY IT

02:33:20.691 --> 02:33:21.759
WOULD HELP THE LEGISLATURE

02:33:21.825 --> 02:33:22.927

02:33:22.993 --> 02:33:24.695
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ACT SO FOR

02:33:24.762 --> 02:33:27.097
EXAMPLE TO THE EXTENT THAT NOT

02:33:27.164 --> 02:33:28.899
ENOUGH CIVIL PENALTY REVENUE

02:33:28.966 --> 02:33:31.635
COMES IN. TO COVER COSTS AS THE

02:33:31.702 --> 02:33:33.137
LEGISLATURE INTENDED THE

02:33:33.203 --> 02:33:34.004
LEGISLATURE MIGHT NEED TO GO IN

02:33:34.071 --> 02:33:36.540
AND CONSIDER ALTERNATIVE ACTION.

02:33:36.607 --> 02:33:38.542
FOR EXAMPLE CHANGING THE AMOUNT

02:33:38.609 --> 02:33:40.578
OF PENALTY THAT COULD BE CHARGED

02:33:40.644 --> 02:33:46.383
FOR A VIOLATION [inaudible]

02:33:46.450 --> 02:33:48.719
OKAY.

02:33:48.786 --> 02:33:50.521
QUESTIONS BY.

02:33:50.588 --> 02:33:52.523
MEETING ON THIS [inaudible]

02:33:52.590 --> 02:33:56.961
ONE BERMAN FINANCE.

02:33:57.027 --> 02:33:58.696
GOOD AFTERNOON CAME TO BE

02:33:58.762 --> 02:33:59.763
TREATED ON A FINANCE AM.

02:33:59.830 --> 02:34:00.864
NOTE THAT ALTERNATE RECOMMENDED

02:34:00.931 --> 02:34:02.299
BY THE LA -- CREATES A NUMBER OF

02:34:02.366 --> 02:34:03.901
CHALLENGES SUCH AS WHEN THE

02:34:03.968 --> 02:34:05.402
SETTLEMENT MONEY WILL ARRIVE HOW

02:34:05.469 --> 02:34:07.104
MUCH WILL BE RECEIVED AND WHEN

02:34:07.171 --> 02:34:08.205
IT WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO REPAY

02:34:08.272 --> 02:34:10.274
THE LOANS.

02:34:10.341 --> 02:34:12.309
AND SUPPORT THE PROGRAM.

02:34:12.376 --> 02:34:13.577
IF NOT ENOUGH SETTLEMENT MONEY

02:34:13.644 --> 02:34:15.813
ARRIVES.

02:34:15.879 --> 02:34:18.749
ADDITIONAL LOAN OR GENERAL FUND

02:34:18.816 --> 02:34:21.251
WILL THEN BE NEED TO PROVIDE.

02:34:21.318 --> 02:34:23.220
S. S. SET UP -- THAT THE NEED.

02:34:23.287 --> 02:34:24.021
I PROPOSAL SEEKS TO ADDRESS THIS

02:34:24.088 --> 02:34:25.656
VERY ABILITY BY PROVIDING THE

02:34:25.723 --> 02:34:27.625
GENERAL FUND AND UNFAIR

02:34:27.691 --> 02:34:29.026
COMPETITION LOAN FUNNY NOW.

02:34:29.093 --> 02:34:30.227
REDUCTION OF THESE FUNDS AND

02:34:30.294 --> 02:34:32.296
RESOURCES CAN BE REEVALUATED

02:34:32.363 --> 02:34:34.264
WHEN THE REVENUE FROM THE

02:34:34.331 --> 02:34:34.565
SETTLEMENT.

02:34:34.632 --> 02:34:40.771
IT COMES DOWN.

02:34:40.838 --> 02:34:42.606
BOTH APPROACHES SEEM TO HAVE

02:34:42.673 --> 02:34:45.109
PROBLEMS ON THE ONE HAND.

02:34:45.175 --> 02:34:48.178
THE APPROACH OF JUST FOR RUNNING

02:34:48.245 --> 02:34:49.980
THE CONSUMER BINDING.

02:34:50.047 --> 02:34:51.615
AND IT'S NOT AND IF IT DOESN'T

02:34:51.682 --> 02:34:52.850
COME THROUGH IN IF WE DON'T

02:34:52.916 --> 02:34:54.118
RECEIVE THAT KIND OF REVENUES

02:34:54.184 --> 02:34:55.219
AND OF COURSE YOU HAVE TO

02:34:55.285 --> 02:34:56.387
COMPENSATE THE CONSUMER FUND

02:34:56.453 --> 02:34:57.321
WITH THE GENERAL FUND BUT

02:34:57.388 --> 02:34:59.256
FRONTING THE GENERAL FUND AND

02:34:59.323 --> 02:35:00.124
NOT BEEN.

02:35:00.190 --> 02:35:02.593
SEEKING TO REPAY THE GENERAL

02:35:02.660 --> 02:35:03.427
FUND WITH THAT.

02:35:03.494 --> 02:35:04.294
SO MAYBE THERE'S A HYBRID

02:35:04.361 --> 02:35:04.595
[inaudible]

02:35:04.662 --> 02:35:07.531
ON IN STAFF.

02:35:07.598 --> 02:35:10.701
THINK ABOUT THAT.

02:35:10.768 --> 02:35:14.938
ANY OTHER COMMENT.

02:35:15.005 --> 02:35:16.407
I MEANI THINK WHAT PARTLY WHAT

02:35:16.473 --> 02:35:18.175
I HAVE BEEN.

02:35:18.242 --> 02:35:20.244
IT'S NOT BEEN NECESSARILY

02:35:20.310 --> 02:35:21.979
EXPLICIT BUT IN A LOT OF OUR

02:35:22.046 --> 02:35:24.281
CONVERSATIONS WE KNOWTHAT

02:35:24.348 --> 02:35:26.083
THERE'S A REVENUE SOURCE.

02:35:26.150 --> 02:35:28.886
ON THAT WE HAVEN'T YET EITHER

02:35:28.952 --> 02:35:32.956
MAXIMIZED ARE UTILIZED AND THEN

02:35:33.023 --> 02:35:33.624
WE USE GENERAL FUND BUT WE DON'T

02:35:33.691 --> 02:35:34.958
SEEM TO WE RARELY SEEM TO EVER

02:35:35.025 --> 02:35:36.727
REPAY THE GENERAL FUND.

02:35:36.794 --> 02:35:38.095
I'M TRYING TO ACHIEVE SOME

02:35:38.162 --> 02:35:40.030
ABILITY.

02:35:40.097 --> 02:35:42.299
TO AB MAXIMIZER USE OF SPECIAL

02:35:42.366 --> 02:35:47.271
FUNDS FOR THEIR PURPOSES --

02:35:47.337 --> 02:35:48.138

02:44:54.351 --> 02:44:56.786
I'M.

02:44:56.853 --> 02:44:58.021
DIFFICULT OF COURSE IN THIS

02:44:58.088 --> 02:45:01.625
MOMENT TO KNOW WHETHER THIS IS A

02:45:01.691 --> 02:45:02.158
WE KNOW IT'S AN INCREASED

02:45:02.225 --> 02:45:03.326
WORKLOAD.

02:45:03.393 --> 02:45:06.229
IS THIS AN OVERSTATEMENT OF NEED

02:45:06.296 --> 02:45:07.364
OR AN UNDERSTATEMENT IT IS HARD

02:45:07.430 --> 02:45:09.266
TO DETERMINE.

02:45:09.332 --> 02:45:11.167

02:45:36.092 --> 02:45:37.694

02:53:48.417 --> 02:53:53.756
YEAH TO BE A REASONABLE PERSON

02:53:53.823 --> 02:53:56.058
THEIR DECISION.

02:53:56.125 --> 02:53:57.927
I'M IF THE LEAD AGAINST HER

FILED CASES AGAINST CALIFORNIA

02:54:00.129 --> 02:54:02.098
AND THEN DECIDE. TO REQUEST TO

02:54:02.165 --> 02:54:04.534
STAY THEN THAT PROCESS HAS TO

02:54:04.600 --> 02:54:06.135
KIND OF KICK OFF AND HAS TO BE

02:54:06.202 --> 02:54:06.969
LITIGATED.

02:54:07.036 --> 02:54:08.971
AND ADJUDICATED BEFORE THEN WE

CAN MOVE FORWARD SO THERE'S

02:54:10.239 --> 02:54:12.308
ACTUALLY TWO PIECES GOING ON AND

02:54:12.375 --> 02:54:13.109
SO THOSE ARE KIND OF THE TERMS

02:54:13.176 --> 02:54:13.609
AND CONDITIONS.

02:54:13.676 --> 02:54:15.578
IS LAID OUT ON PAGE TWENTY SEVEN

02:54:15.645 --> 02:54:17.180
OF YOUR AGENDA WHAT'S THE BOTTOM

02:54:17.246 --> 02:54:18.281
THE TWO CONDITIONS YOU'LL SEE IT

02:54:18.347 --> 02:54:19.715
HIGHLIGHTED NUMBERS AND SO I

02:54:19.782 --> 02:54:20.950
THINK THAT THAT'S A

02:54:21.017 --> 02:54:22.585
CONSIDERATION.

02:54:22.652 --> 02:54:25.521
THE COMMITTEE WILL WANT TO TAKE

02:54:25.588 --> 02:54:27.290
INTO ACCOUNT ROOMS OF THE

02:54:27.356 --> 02:54:28.858
THERE'S WAYS WE CAN SPEND MONEY

02:54:28.925 --> 02:54:31.127
WE CAN SEE THAT IN THE BUDGET

02:54:31.194 --> 02:54:32.695
AND THEN THERE CAN BE LIKE A

02:54:32.762 --> 02:54:35.598
DECISION LATER TO SPEND MONEY

02:54:35.665 --> 02:54:38.835
BASED ON WHAT HAPPENS AT WORK IS.

02:54:38.901 --> 02:54:40.503
SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE

02:54:40.570 --> 02:54:42.271
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE.

02:54:42.338 --> 02:54:43.206
YOU CAN DO A ONE WAY THE OTHER

02:54:43.272 --> 02:54:45.174
YOU CAN WAIT UNTIL.

SOMETHING IS DECIDED IN A

02:54:47.910 --> 02:54:50.279
COMMAND JUST GET A MONEY SPENT

02:54:50.346 --> 02:54:51.214
ON IMPLEMENTING SAYING OR YOU

02:54:51.280 --> 02:54:52.949
CAN.

02:54:53.015 --> 02:54:56.219
WE HAVE NO IDEA WHAT HAPPENED.

02:54:56.285 --> 02:54:57.787
I AM A TIMING WISE -- I AGREE IT

02:54:57.854 --> 02:54:59.522
IS KIND THERE IS UNCERTAINTY OUT

02:54:59.589 --> 02:55:00.756
THERE I THINK.

02:55:00.823 --> 02:55:02.191
ONTHE RECOMMENDATION FROM THE

ALLOWING THEM TO USE MONEY UNTIL

WE KNOW THE PENDING CASES OF THE

02:55:09.332 --> 02:55:10.600
CORE I THINK I'M WE WOULD BE

02:55:10.666 --> 02:55:11.934
VERY COMFORTABLE WITH THAT

02:55:12.001 --> 02:55:14.203
RECOMMENDATION -- AND THEN THAT

02:55:14.270 --> 02:55:16.606
WAY IF IF YOU KNOW THEY ARE NOT

02:55:16.672 --> 02:55:17.473
ABLE TO USE THIS MONEY THAT GOT

02:55:17.540 --> 02:55:19.242
REVERTS BACK TO THE GENERAL FUND

02:55:19.308 --> 02:55:19.809
AND THEN WE CAN USE IN THE

02:55:19.876 --> 02:55:20.910
FUTURE YEARS BUT I DO THINK WE

02:55:20.977 --> 02:55:22.111
SHOULD BE READY.

02:55:22.178 --> 02:55:24.680
IN CASE YOU KNOW THEY CAN START

02:55:24.747 --> 02:55:25.248
USING THIS FUNDING WE DON'T

02:55:25.314 --> 02:55:26.649
WANNA HAVE TO RESPECT AND EVERY

02:55:26.716 --> 02:55:28.718

02:55:41.998 --> 02:55:44.066
WHAT.

02:55:44.133 --> 02:55:44.901
THIS SOUNDS LIKE IT'S NOT GONNA

02:55:44.967 --> 02:55:46.769
BE JULY FIRST FOR SURE

02:55:46.836 --> 02:55:47.069
[inaudible]

02:55:47.136 --> 02:55:48.237
IS DETERMINED.

02:55:48.304 --> 02:55:50.473
BASED ON OUR EVALUATION US AS AT

02:55:50.539 --> 02:55:52.808
THIS IS HONOR VALUATION OF THE

02:55:52.875 --> 02:55:54.377
PCP WE THINK THAT.

02:55:54.443 --> 02:55:55.845
THE REQUEST IS REASONABLE IN

02:55:55.912 --> 02:55:57.413
TERMS OF THE CALCULATION AGAIN

02:55:57.480 --> 02:55:58.781
IT'S AN ESTIMATE.

02:55:58.848 --> 02:56:00.049
SIMILAR TO THAT -- AS THE

02:56:00.116 --> 02:56:01.217
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE INDICATED

02:56:01.284 --> 02:56:02.218
IT WOULD MAKE THE RESOURCES

02:56:02.285 --> 02:56:03.719
AVAILABLE IF THEY DON'T SPEND IT

02:56:03.786 --> 02:56:04.654
ALL IT DOES REVERT BACK TO THE

02:56:04.720 --> 02:56:07.490
GENERAL FUND YEAH AND SO FOR

02:56:07.556 --> 02:56:08.891
EXAMPLE IN AND IF IT DOESN'T.

02:56:08.958 --> 02:56:10.393
GO INTO A FACT THEY CAN'T USE AS

02:56:10.459 --> 02:56:11.928
OF JULY ONE THEY START FOR

02:56:11.994 --> 02:56:13.963
EXAMPLE IN DECEMBER AND HE WAS

02:56:14.030 --> 02:56:14.997
JUST BE HAVING ACROSS FROM

02:56:15.064 --> 02:56:17.867
DECEMBER THROUGH THE END OF THE

02:56:17.934 --> 02:56:19.869
YEAR AND THEN WHATEVER.

02:56:19.936 --> 02:56:21.304
I'M SORRY FATE MAY REALLY FAST I

02:56:21.370 --> 02:56:21.938
DO WANT TO JUST CLARIFY THAT I

02:56:22.004 --> 02:56:23.005
MISSPOKE IT IS NOT THE GENERAL

02:56:23.072 --> 02:56:25.007
FUND IS UNFAIR COMPETITION LAW

02:56:25.074 --> 02:56:26.509
AND SO IT GOES BACK TO A SPECIAL

02:56:26.575 --> 02:56:27.343
FUND.

02:56:27.410 --> 02:56:28.878
I'M SO THERE IS NO GENERAL FUND

02:56:28.945 --> 02:56:30.346

I DON'T HAVE ANY MORE QUESTIONS

02:56:36.152 --> 02:56:38.254
I GUESS.

02:56:38.321 --> 02:56:39.822
AND AS WE'RE HOLDING THIS SO WE

02:56:39.889 --> 02:56:40.589
WILL FIND MORE AB DO THE NEXT

02:56:40.656 --> 02:56:41.857
FEW WEEKS WE'LL GET MORE

02:56:41.924 --> 02:56:43.225
INFORMATION.

02:56:43.292 --> 02:56:44.860
YOU KNOW ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON

02:56:44.927 --> 02:56:47.430
AND THAT WOULD BE PROBABLY ORDER

02:56:47.496 --> 02:56:47.630
LIST.

02:56:47.697 --> 02:56:49.932
LOOK AT OR MAYBE WE CAN HAVE A

02:56:49.999 --> 02:56:51.334
DISCUSSION ON WHETHER THE A AG

02:56:51.400 --> 02:56:53.269
IMPLEMENTS A BILL.

02:56:53.336 --> 02:56:55.471
AFTER WE'VE APPROVED IT OR HE

02:56:55.538 --> 02:56:56.072
WAY TO OF THE ART [inaudible]

02:56:56.138 --> 02:56:58.441
RULE.

02:56:58.507 --> 02:57:00.242
WE HAD A DISCUSSION YET AT ALL

02:57:00.309 --> 02:57:00.543
[inaudible]

02:57:00.609 --> 02:57:03.012
I'M WHAT.

02:57:03.079 --> 02:57:05.214
WHAT?

02:57:05.281 --> 02:57:05.781
A SO WE JUST HOLD WE'RE JUST

02:57:05.848 --> 02:57:07.383
HOLDING.

02:57:07.450 --> 02:57:09.218
THIS WILL BE A UNDER YOUR

02:57:09.285 --> 02:57:12.021
SPECIAL NOTE FOR YOUR DIFFERENT

02:57:12.088 --> 02:57:13.589
DIFFERENT DIVISION THEN WE ARE

02:57:13.656 --> 02:57:15.424
BOTH WITHIN THEIR CONSUMER LAW

02:57:15.491 --> 02:57:18.027
SECTION HOWEVER OKAY.

02:57:18.094 --> 02:57:18.828
IS THAT.

02:57:18.894 --> 02:57:19.795
I THIS UNIT IN AND ARE YOU

02:57:19.862 --> 02:57:21.097
WRITING REGULATIONS ARE DOING

02:57:21.163 --> 02:57:22.365
ANYTHING OF THAT NATURE AT THIS

02:57:22.431 --> 02:57:23.966
POINT OR JUST ON ALL.

02:57:24.033 --> 02:57:25.701
ON AN INEQUALITY IN THAT WE

02:57:25.768 --> 02:57:27.503
WOULD NOT.

02:57:27.570 --> 02:57:29.705
THIS WOULD BE ENFORCEMENT.

02:57:29.772 --> 02:57:32.942
I'M REQUEST WE WOULD

02:57:33.009 --> 02:57:33.542
OCCASIONALLY AS WE DO IN WITH

02:57:33.609 --> 02:57:35.177
OTHER.

02:57:35.244 --> 02:57:38.647
WOULD BE ABLE.

02:57:38.714 --> 02:57:39.448
I WOULD NOTE FOR THE RECORD IF

02:57:39.515 --> 02:57:41.350
THIS IS A FEDERAL STATE.

02:57:41.417 --> 02:57:42.852
ON THE ENTIRE STATE.

02:57:42.918 --> 02:57:45.187
SO THE LAW WE HAVE NO CHOICE BUT

02:57:45.254 --> 02:57:47.089
NOT IMPLEMENTED WERE ALLIES IN

02:57:47.156 --> 02:57:48.557
THE OTHER CASES.

02:57:48.624 --> 02:57:51.027
WE HAD STAYS IN INDIVIDUAL

02:57:51.093 --> 02:57:54.797
COUNTIES. FOR WHICH EVERY CORTES

02:57:54.864 --> 02:57:57.666
HEARD THIS DAY AS LIVE.

02:57:57.733 --> 02:57:59.502
A SIMILAR SCENE EARLIER THAT I

02:57:59.568 --> 02:57:59.802
MISSED THAT.

02:57:59.869 --> 02:58:01.971
NOT SURE.

02:58:02.038 --> 02:58:04.940
ANYWAY JUST FOR THE RECORD.

02:58:05.007 --> 02:58:07.710
BUT ON THIS ONE THOUGH WHAT I

02:58:07.777 --> 02:58:10.046
MEAN WERE.

02:58:10.112 --> 02:58:12.281
WE DON'T KNOW WHEN WE WILL BE

02:58:12.348 --> 02:58:14.417
SUCCESSFUL BUT CERTAINLY

02:58:14.483 --> 02:58:14.717
[inaudible]

02:58:14.784 --> 02:58:15.818
IN EVERY.

02:58:15.885 --> 02:58:17.720
THE BILL IS LAW [inaudible]

02:58:17.787 --> 02:58:20.823
AND IT WOULD SEEM TO ME THAT WE

02:58:20.890 --> 02:58:23.125
WOULD APPROPRIATE.

02:58:23.192 --> 02:58:24.994
AND WE WOULD.

02:58:25.061 --> 02:58:26.929
THEN RECOVER IT OF COURSE TO

02:58:26.996 --> 02:58:29.131
RETURN IT TO THE FIND IF IT'S IF

02:58:29.198 --> 02:58:30.800
WE CAN'T BEGIN IMPLEMENTATION.

02:58:30.866 --> 02:58:33.602
SO THAT THAT IS CERTAINLY.

02:58:33.669 --> 02:58:35.237
BACK THAT ANYTHING WE

02:58:35.304 --> 02:58:36.672
APPROPRIATE COULD BE CHALLENGED

02:58:36.739 --> 02:58:37.573
IN THE COURT.

02:58:37.640 --> 02:58:39.875
IS ALWAYS AVAIL IS ALWAYS A

02:58:39.942 --> 02:58:42.411
PRESS IS ALWAYS OF WHATEVER.

02:58:42.478 --> 02:58:44.613
ACTOR SO.

02:58:44.680 --> 02:58:46.749
WE WILL HOLD IT OPEN BUT I THINK

02:58:46.816 --> 02:58:49.819
WE WILL.

02:58:49.885 --> 02:58:51.020
YOU KNOW MY RECOMMENDATION THE

02:58:51.087 --> 02:58:52.655
WORLD ANYWAY WILL BE.

02:58:52.721 --> 02:58:54.857
AS WE TAKE THAT BUDGET ACTIONS

02:58:54.924 --> 02:58:59.562
WAS WE WRAP UP TO ACT ON THIS.

02:58:59.628 --> 02:59:00.696
ONE ALL RIGHT.

02:59:00.763 --> 02:59:03.165
ANY OTHER A QUESTIONS OR

02:59:03.232 --> 02:59:08.504
COMMENTS PUBLIC COMMENT ON THIS.

02:59:08.571 --> 02:59:11.407
OKAY SO ISSUE TWENTY ONE THEN WE

02:59:11.474 --> 02:59:12.608
HAVE OUR OVERSIGHT THIS IS A NEW

02:59:12.675 --> 02:59:17.847
AND EXPANDED CRIMES PCP.

02:59:17.913 --> 02:59:19.081
THE NEW AND EXPANDED FRIENDS PCP

02:59:19.148 --> 02:59:21.550
IS AGAIN IT'S A PROPOSAL.

02:59:21.617 --> 02:59:22.785
RELATED TO SOME LEGISLATION THAT

02:59:22.852 --> 02:59:24.920
WAS PASSED -- WERE REQUESTING

02:59:24.987 --> 02:59:27.523
ONE POSITION AND A HUNDRED AND

02:59:27.590 --> 02:59:28.090
FORTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS

02:59:28.157 --> 02:59:29.492
GENERAL FUND ON GOING.

02:59:29.558 --> 02:59:30.092
THE INCREASED WORKLOAD

02:59:30.159 --> 02:59:31.894
ASSOCIATED WITH UPDATING AND

02:59:31.961 --> 02:59:32.862
MAINTAINING A STANDARDIZED SET

02:59:32.928 --> 02:59:34.230
OF TABLES TO BE USED BY CRIMINAL

02:59:34.296 --> 02:59:36.198
JUSTICE AGENCIES AND SUBMITTING

02:59:36.265 --> 02:59:38.534
CRIMINAL RECORDS AND INFORMATION

02:59:38.601 --> 02:59:46.208
OR YOU JUST OF IT.

02:59:46.275 --> 02:59:48.711
RIGHT I LA -- WE RECOMMEND

02:59:48.777 --> 02:59:51.013
REJECTING THIS PROPOSAL -- THE

02:59:51.080 --> 02:59:52.548
DEPARTMENT HAS BEEN UNABLE TO

02:59:52.615 --> 02:59:53.582
PROVIDE KIND OF SUFFICIENT

02:59:53.649 --> 02:59:55.718
INFORMATION OR WHY RESOURCES

02:59:55.784 --> 02:59:57.119
WOULD BE NEEDED AND IT'S UNCLEAR

02:59:57.186 --> 02:59:58.320
TO US WHY.

02:59:58.387 --> 03:00:00.589
THE STATE THE LISTS CANNOT BE

03:00:00.656 --> 03:00:01.290
UPDATED WITHIN EXISTING

03:00:01.357 --> 03:00:02.958
RESOURCES LEGISLATURE WE DO

03:00:03.025 --> 03:00:04.326
ACKNOWLEDGE LEGISLATURE AN AXE

03:00:04.393 --> 03:00:05.561
BILLS EVERY YEAR.

03:00:05.628 --> 03:00:07.196
THE TABLES SHOULD NEED TO BE

03:00:07.263 --> 03:00:08.631
UPDATED ONCE A YEAR.

03:00:08.697 --> 03:00:10.799
AND SO IT'S UNCLEAR TO US WHY

03:00:10.866 --> 03:00:11.400
THE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE

03:00:11.467 --> 03:00:13.068
CURRENTLY DOING AND AREN'T

03:00:13.135 --> 03:00:14.637
AVAILABLE TO DO IT.

03:00:14.703 --> 03:00:18.807
I'M MOVING FORWARD [inaudible]

03:00:18.874 --> 03:00:23.045
GOOD POINT -- WITH RC JUST

03:00:23.112 --> 03:00:24.313
DIVISION OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS

03:00:24.380 --> 03:00:25.714
HAVE BEEN QUITE A FEW PROJECTS

03:00:25.781 --> 03:00:26.749
QUITE A BIT OF LEGISLATION THAT

03:00:26.815 --> 03:00:29.418
HAS -- LANDED WITH THE C. JUST

03:00:29.485 --> 03:00:31.353
DIVISION AND THIS IS -- AN

03:00:31.420 --> 03:00:32.888
ESTIMATE ON WHAT'S NEEDED. TO

03:00:32.955 --> 03:00:34.623
HAVE THIS SERVICE OR TO HAVE

03:00:34.690 --> 03:00:36.625
THIS WORK DONE ON A MORE

03:00:36.692 --> 03:00:37.826
CONSISTENT BASIS.

03:00:37.893 --> 03:00:39.495
AND TO HAVE A RESOURCE AVAILABLE

03:00:39.562 --> 03:00:41.530
TO DO THAT -- SOME OF THE

03:00:41.597 --> 03:00:43.599
PROJECTS HAVE BEEN NINE FIVE

03:00:43.666 --> 03:00:45.868
THREE THE SB THREE FOR THE

03:00:45.935 --> 03:00:46.835
EXPANDED TEARING BILL.

03:00:46.902 --> 03:00:48.604
WAS TALKED ABOUT EARLIER AND AND

03:00:48.671 --> 03:00:50.139
THOSE PROJECTS HAVE BEEN

03:00:50.206 --> 03:00:51.707
SIGNIFICANT PROJECTS.

03:00:51.774 --> 03:00:53.275
IS A DIVISION AS A WHOLE SO THIS

03:00:53.342 --> 03:00:54.777
WAS -- SIMILAR TO THE ONE I

03:00:54.843 --> 03:00:56.111
TALKED ABOUT EARLIER WE HAVE A

03:00:56.178 --> 03:00:57.613
LOT OF LEGISLATION WE'RE NOT

03:00:57.680 --> 03:00:59.281
ASKING FOR A RESOURCE ON ALL

03:00:59.348 --> 03:01:00.349
THOSE.

03:01:00.416 --> 03:01:03.152
WERE ASKING FOR SOME OF THOSE IN

03:01:03.219 --> 03:01:09.758
A MORE STRATEGIC MANNER

03:01:09.825 --> 03:01:10.059
[inaudible]

03:01:10.125 --> 03:01:15.097
OF THAT SEEMS LIKE A BROAD.

03:01:15.164 --> 03:01:20.603
RESPONSE BUT AGAIN IT'S I GUESS

03:01:20.669 --> 03:01:22.304
I HAVE TO ERR ON THE SIDE OF THE

03:01:22.371 --> 03:01:27.543
LA -- ON THIS ONE BECAUSE IF THE

03:01:27.610 --> 03:01:30.079
WELL I A MIGHT QUIBBLE WITH WHAT

03:01:30.145 --> 03:01:31.947
THE DETAIL IS IN THE EXCEPT

03:01:32.014 --> 03:01:33.549
UNDER.

03:01:33.616 --> 03:01:34.750
ONE AS OF BY SEN I DIFFERENT

03:01:34.817 --> 03:01:37.453
SENSE I HAVE OF WORKLOAD.

03:01:37.519 --> 03:01:39.021
THIS ONE DOESN'T DEMONSTRATE.

03:01:39.088 --> 03:01:40.155
WHAT THE WORKLOAD IS YES

03:01:40.222 --> 03:01:41.624
GENERALLY THAT WE MIGHT HAVE

03:01:41.690 --> 03:01:43.025
MORE?

03:01:43.092 --> 03:01:44.126
AND YET IF IT'S REALLY JUST

03:01:44.193 --> 03:01:49.231
UPDATING -- LISTS THAT ARE

03:01:49.298 --> 03:01:53.702
UPDATED ANNUALLY.

03:01:53.769 --> 03:01:54.837
ARE THEY WHY WE NEED THIS IS

03:01:54.903 --> 03:01:56.672
THIS KNOCKED MANAGER --

03:01:56.739 --> 03:01:57.473
ADDITIONAL [inaudible]

03:01:57.539 --> 03:02:03.979
ALLOCATION.

03:02:04.046 --> 03:02:04.613
WE HAVE A MARK SAME HERE FROM A

03:02:04.680 --> 03:02:05.714
DIVISION WHO MIGHT BE ABLE TO

03:02:05.781 --> 03:02:07.383
WRITE A LITTLE BIT MORE DETAIL

03:02:07.449 --> 03:02:18.394
AND CLARITY ON THIS ISSUE.

03:02:18.460 --> 03:02:20.095
IF IT WOULD BE HELPFUL I CAN

03:02:20.162 --> 03:02:21.130
DESCRIBE A LITTLE BIT OF THE

03:02:21.196 --> 03:02:24.166
PROCESS OF THE DAY -- THE WAY

03:02:24.233 --> 03:02:24.800
THAT THE TABLES ARE MAINTAINED

03:02:24.867 --> 03:02:27.703
IT IS VERY REACTIONARY PROCESS.

03:02:27.770 --> 03:02:31.507
NEW OFFENCES AS GET ADDED TO THE

03:02:31.573 --> 03:02:33.008
TABLE AS LAW ENFORCEMENT

03:02:33.075 --> 03:02:34.643
AGENCIES FOR THEM AT TIME OF A

03:02:34.710 --> 03:02:35.577
REST.

03:02:35.644 --> 03:02:37.179
IT'S NOT DONE AT THE BEGINNING

03:02:37.246 --> 03:02:37.479
OF THE YEAR.

03:02:37.546 --> 03:02:40.282
AT THERE'S NOT STAFF THAT

03:02:40.349 --> 03:02:42.918
CURRENTLY SUPPORT THE STATE WIDE.

03:02:42.985 --> 03:02:45.054
ABEL'S IN GENERAL.

03:02:45.120 --> 03:02:46.689
IT'S DONE BY REDIRECTING STAFF

03:02:46.755 --> 03:02:48.424
THROUGHOUT THE YEAR.

03:02:48.490 --> 03:02:50.459
WHAT ALSO IS PROBLEMATIC ABOUT

03:02:50.526 --> 03:02:53.295
THAT PROCESS IS DUPLICATION OF

03:02:53.362 --> 03:02:54.930
STATUTES THE GIFT BUT ON TO THE

03:02:54.997 --> 03:02:56.498
MASTER TABLES?

03:02:56.565 --> 03:02:58.600
AS ONE AGENCY ASKED FOR AN

03:02:58.667 --> 03:03:00.235
OFFENSE TO BE REPORTED THERE MAY

03:03:00.302 --> 03:03:01.337
BE A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT

03:03:01.403 --> 03:03:03.639
VARIATION OF HOW THE REQUESTED

03:03:03.706 --> 03:03:05.407
THAT IN A DIFFERENT AGENCY. ONE

03:03:05.474 --> 03:03:07.376
AGENCY MAY REFER TO IT AS THE

03:03:07.443 --> 03:03:09.645
CODE SECTION ANOTHER MAY REFER

03:03:09.712 --> 03:03:10.813
