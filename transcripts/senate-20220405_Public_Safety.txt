TROUBLED HERE CAMARGO HERE COME UNDER HERE SKINNER SKINNER HERE WIENER. ALL RIGHT WE SHOULD HEAR FROM OUR FIRST OFFER- PROTEIN MACHEN'S YOU MAY PRESENT YOUR BILL SB. THIRTY FOUR. WELL THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND COLLEAGUES ITIS GOOD TO SEE YOU THIS MORNING THIS IS A FIRST FOR ME IN THIS NEW HEARING ROOM- SO I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME THIS MORNING. COLLEAGUES LAST FALL IN MY DISTRICT A STATE COURT HAD DETERMINED THAT A SEXUALLY VIOLENT PREDATOR AND S. B. P. INDIVIDUAL. UNDER THE CARE pHOSPITALS SHOULD BE PLACED ON CONDITIONAL RELEASE ALSO KNOWN AS CONRAD. AFTER THE PERSON AND FINISH THEIR CRIMINAL SENTENCE AND NOW HAVING COMPLETED THEIR CIVIL COMMITMENT BY RECEIVING MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT AND SERVICES FROM THE STATE A COURT DETERMINED THAT THE PERSON WAS NO LONGER A DANGER TO OTHERS AND COULD SAFELY BE RETURNED TO THE COMMUNITY. HOWEVER UNDER SUPERVISION THAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THE CONRAD PROGRAM. ONCE THIS DETERMINATION WAS MADE IT WAS THEN UP TO THE COURT TO WORK WITH THE STATE TO FIND A SUITABLE HOUSING PLACEMENT FOR THIS INDIVIDUAL. CONSISTENT WITH OTHER RULES LIKE RADIUS RESTRICTIONS AND ENSURING GPS SURVEILLANCE AND MONITORING. BUT WHEN IT WAS ANNOUNCED WHERE THE S. V. P. WOULD BE PLACED THERE WAS SIGNIFICANT PUBLIC OUTCRY. PARENTS AND FAMILIES WERE CONCERNED AND ON FIRST IMPRESSION I TOO WAS INCREDIBLY CONCERNED. THE COMMUNITY SAID THAT THERE WERE FLAWS IN THE PROCESS AND THAT THERE WAS NO COLLABORATION BETWEEN THE STATE. AND LOCAL MUNICIPALITIES. SO I TOOK A DEEP LOOK AT HOW WE CAN ENSURE THAT LOCAL JUSTICE PARTNERS COULD BE HEARD IN THESE CRITICAL HOUSING PLACEMENT DECISIONS. AND HOW TO KEEP OUR COMMUNITY SAFE WHILE ALSO RESPECTING OUR CONSTITUTIONAL RESPONSIBILITIES. THIS IS A RESPONSIBILITY THAT REQUIRES BY LAW US TO RE INTEGRATE BACK INTO SOCIETY INDIVIDUALS WHO SERVE THEIR TIME AND WHOSE MENTAL DISORDER HAS BEEN TREATED SO THAT IS SAFE FOR THEM TO BE SUPERVISED BACK IN THE COMMUNITY. SINCE THE INCEPTION OF THE PROGRAM IN NINETEEN NINETY SIX THERE HAVE BEEN FIFTY ONE S. B. P.'S PLACED INTO CONRAD INTO THE PROGRAM. NONE OF WHO HAVE RE OFFENDED AS PART OF THE PROGRAM THOSE INDIVIDUALS ARE CLOSELY MONITORED DRUG TESTED GPS TRACKED AND RECEIVE ONGOING TREATMENT AND SUPPORT. CONVERSELY EIGHT ESCAPEES HAVE BEEN RELEASED TO TRANSIENT STATUS WITHOUT ANY CONDITIONS OR SURVEILLANCE OR MONITORING BECAUSE IT WAS TOO DIFFICULT FOR THEIR COMMUNITIES TO FIND SUITABLE HOUSING FOR THEM. AND I DON'T THINK THAT'S OKAY. I IN WHERE THE SYSTEM NEEDS TO BE IMPROVED IT'S NOT OKAY FOR THE COMMUNITY IT'S NOT OKAY FOR THE INDIVIDUAL. SO SB TEN THIRTY FOUR IS INTENDED TO CREATE A MORE STRUCTURED PROCESS FOR ALL RELEVANT COMMUNITY STAKEHOLDERS TO COLLECTIVELY MAKE APPROPRIATE LOCAL HOUSING PLACEMENT DECISIONS. WHILE BALANCING OUR CONSTITUTIONAL OLIGATIONS THIS IN TURN WOULD REDUCE THE RISK OF TRANSIENT PLACEMENT ALL OF WHICH ULTIMATELY INCREASES PUBLIC PREVENT ONE COUNTY FROM PASSING THE BUCK BASICALLY AND JUST MOVING THEIR SVP INTO ANOTHER JURISDICTION SB TEN THIRTY FOUR CREATES A MORE DETAILED PROCESS FOR HOW A COURT MAY AUTHORIZE A COUNTY TO PLACE AN STP INTO ANOTHER JURISDICTION FOR ME THAT IS A FAIRNESS ISSUE. AT THE END OF THE DAY A JURISDICTION THAT PLACES A PERSON INTO THE SYSTEM SHOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THEM WHEN THEY COME OUT. RESEARCH SHOWS OR HAS SHOWN THAT INDIVIDUALS RELEASED BACK INTO THEIR HOME COMMUNITY THEIR DOMICILE RESIDENCE WHERE THEY HAVE TIES TO THE COMMUNITY ARE LESS LIKELY TO RE OFFEND. SO SB TEN THIRTY FOUR IS ATTEMPTING TO CREATE A THOUGHTFUL APPROACH THAT CREATES ADDITIONAL ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY FOR THE PUBLIC IN ORDER TO KEEP OUR COMMUNITY SAFE HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS- BUT WE'RE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION AND I VOTE ON TEN THIRTY FOUR. LET US BEGIN WITH ANY WE HAVE A LEAD WITNESS INCENDIO OF MADAM CHAIR NO NOT TO WORRY- LET'S. SEE IF THERE'S ANYONE IN THE HEARING ROOM THAT WANTS TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. SEEING NONE WILL GO TO THE PHONE LINES- MODERATOR. WOULD YOU OPEN THE PHONE LINES AND ASK SUPPORT WITNESSES FOR SB TEN THIRTY FOUR. TO PROCEED. THANK YOU IF YOU'D LIKE TO SPEAK ITS SUPPORT OF SB TEN THIRTY FOUR PLEASE PRESS ONE AND ZERO AT THIS TIME. IT'LL BE JUST A MOMENT FOR OUR FIRST PERSON. I APOLOGIZE FOR THE DELAY IT'LL JUST BE ANOTHER MOMENT HERE. IN LINE TWELFTH PLEASE GO AHEAD SHANNON LEFT ON THE RESIDENTS TALKING CALIFORNIA NINE IN SUPPORT OF SB TEN THIRTY FOUR. THANK YOU. THANK YOU THERE ARE NO OTHER LINES IN SUPPORT PLEASE CONTINUE. ALL RIGHT SO NOW WE'LL MOVE TO OUR ARMED. OPPOSITION AND- WE HAVE IS LEAD OPPOSITION PAT ESPINOSA FROM THE SAN DIEGO COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE- THAT- MISTER OR MISS ESPINOZA IS GOING TO BE CALLING SO MODERATOR WOULD YOU PLEASE ALLOW ESPINOZA TO SPEAK. IT MORNING MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE CAN YOU HEAR ME YES. I JUST KNOW THAT CALLING ON BEHALF OF THE SAN DIEGO DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE AND DISTRICT ATTORNEY SUMMER STEPHAN AND ALSO THE CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION AND WE APPLAUD THE PRETENCE EFFORTS IN THE AREA TO IMPROVE FTP LAW AND WE BELIEVE THERE ARE. VALUABLE PROVISIONS WITHIN SB TEN THIRTY FOUR BUT WE ARE OPPOSED. TO ONE MAJOR PORTION OF XP TEN THIRTY FOUR AND THAT IS THE BILL'S REQUIREMENTS TO INCLUDE DISTRICT ATTORNEY TO PROVIDE ASSISTANCE AND CONSULTATION IN THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE HOSPITALS PROCESS OF LOCATING CRITICS ACCUSING HOUSING WITHIN THE COUNTY FOR PERSONS COMMITTED AS STDS OR SEXUALLY VIOLENT PREDATORS. WHO ABOUT TO BE CONDITIONALLY RELEASED AND PLACED IN THE COMMUNITY. AS THE PARTY THAT TYPICALLY OPPOSES THE DECISION TO CONDITIONALLY RELEASE INDIVIDUAL BESPOKE THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY AND DIFFICULT POSITION WE THINK THAT'S A CONFLICT ALSO HAVE THE EIGHT PLAYER ROLE. IN SELECTING A LOCATION TO PLACE THE INDIVIDUAL WITHIN THE COMMUNITY. THIS IS A ATTORNEY. AND EX ALL LAW WHILE NOT SPECIFIC DOES ALLOW. GOVERNMENT TO CHOOSE WITHIN COUNTY GOVERNMENT WHO IS THE BEST AGENCY WITH COUNTY TO THAT AND SHE CAN AND WE HAVE- WE HAVE THAT. IN OUR LOW BORDERS SUPERVISORS HAS SELECTED. HELP THE TEAM SERVICES WITHIN OUR COUNTY AS IF THE ENTITY THAT DOES THAT. BUT MORE BROADLY BUT LEAVING WIDE DISTRICT ATTORNEY IS NOT THE APPROPRIATE INDIVIDUAL PLAYER IT ROLE IN SELECTING A PLACEMENT OF THE SDP WHO EXPECT CONDITION RELEASED IS THAT THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY DOES NOT HAVE FULL ACCESS TO THE TREATMENT RECORDS AND THIS IS THE TREATMENT DECISION. OFTENTIMES IMPACT IF PEOPLE ENGAGE IN. OPPOSITION FROM OUR PARTNERS ON THE DEFENSE SIDE WHO WILL CLAIM THAT. YOU KNOW IT IT SHOULD SHOULD APPROPRIATE YOU HAVE TO DISTRICT ATTORNEY PLAY A ROLE IN TREATMENT TYPE DECISION THAT HAVING ACCESS TO TREATMENT INFORMATION. THE ARGUMENT IS MADE THAT THIS WOULD HAPPEN NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE THERAPEUTIC RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE S. B. P. AND HIS TREATMENT PROVIDERS. AND SHOULD PROVIDE A MEANINGFUL ROLE IN THE PLACEMENT THIS DECISION THE DISTRICT ATTORNEYS HAVE TO HAVE ACCESS TO TREATMENT RECORDS TO KNOW. WHAT IT. ASIAN ON THE BEST PLAY. IT WOULD BE IN THE ASK P. FOR BUT ALL PROTECT THE COMMUNITY IN ORDER MAKE THOSE. ISSUE IS DISTRICT COURT WOULD HAVE TO HAPPEN. AND WHAT TYPE OF TREAT WHAT TYPE OF SUCCESS ON THREE WHAT ARE THE TRIGGER AND WHERE CONSISTS. FOR THEIR COULD BE MEETINGS ASSISTANCE IN CONSULTATION. BUT FOR THOSE REASONS. D. CALIFORNIA JUST TWENTY TO AS AS WE CAN GO COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE I WOULD GREATLY OPPOSED CAN THIRTY FOUR HOWEVER WE DO- RECOGNIZE THERE ARE SOME VALUABLE PROVISIONS AND WE'RE WILLING TO WORK WITH THE SENATOR IN IN MOVING THIS THIS LEGISLATION FOR IF WE COULD COME TO SOME AGREEMENT TO- REMOVE THE ROLE OF THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY IN SELECTING A PLACEMENT FOR THE F. FIFTY WHO'S BEEN CONDITIONALLY RELEASED. THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT LET ME GO TO THE HEARING AND SEE IF THERE'S ANYONE ELSE IN THE ROOM WHO WANTS TESTIFIED IN OPPOSITION. TO THE SP TEN THIRTY FOUR. RIGHT SEEING NON MODERATOR WE BUTTE PLEASE QUEUE UP ANY WHO WANTS TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION TO TEN THIRTY FOUR. AND IN- FOR THOSE OF YOU ON THE PHONE LINE YOU WILL SAY YOUR NAME AFFILIATION. AND THAT YOU OPPOSE AND THAT'S IT. THAT'S THE POINT WE'RE AT IN THIS- COMET. GO AHEAD MODERATOR EIGHT. THANK YOU LADIES AND GENTLEMEN IF YOU OPPOSED SB TEN THIRTY FOUR PLEASE PRESS ONE ZERO AT THIS TIME. THERE ARE NO LINES IN OPPOSITION PLEASE CONTINUE. I'M SORRY MARCH THIRTY IT USED TO THE PAUSE ALL RIGHT SO- LET ME TURN TO- COMMITTEE AND SEE IF THERE'S ANY COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. OKAY GO AHEAD- SENATOR JOE BURKE I JUST HAVE ONE QUESTION AND THAT'S WITH REGARDS TO THE CONCERN THAT THE DA- INCLUDING I THOUGHT IT YOU SHOULD HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO EXPRESS WHY THAT WOULD BE IMPORTANT Y. INCLUDED THE DA IN THAT DECISION SENATOR THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION AND I HOPE FOR AN OPPORTUNITY TO RESPOND I HAVE SPOKEN WITH MY DISTRICT ATTORNEY WE'VE WORKED TOGETHER ON MANY ISSUES IN THE PAST FIRST WE DO NOT BELIEVE THIS IS A CONFLICT WE ARE SEEKING ADDITIONAL COUNCIL TO CONFIRM THAT. SECOND IT'S IN EXISTING PROTOCOL THAT THE DA PARTICIPATE THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION MANDATES ALL PARTIES COME TO THE TABLE. IT IS NOT ASKING THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY TO SELECT A PLACE THAT IS NOT THE EXPERTISE OF THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY THEY DO REPRESENT THE PEOPLE. AND THEY DO AN INVESTIGATION TO DETERMINE IS THE PLACEMENT BEING RECOMMENDED BY THE CONTRACTOR LIBERTY AND CON. CONCERT WITH THE OTHER PARTIES AT THE TABLE THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES THE PUBLIC DEFENDER- IT IS NOT THEIR EXPERTISE BUT THEY DO OF THEIR OWN IN. ASSESSMENT INVESTIGATION TO DETERMINE DOESN'T MEET THE EXISTING LAW IN TERMS OF RADIUS OF LOCATION TO FOR EXAMPLE CHILD CARE SCHOOLS ECCENTRIC. SO THE DA DOES THAT- THIS IS NOT ASKING THEM TO PARTICIPATE IN THAT IN DEPTH PROCESS OF FINDING A LOCATION. BUT WHAT WE ARE FINDING IS THAT PEOPLE DON'T COME TO THE TABLE. R. WHILE THERE IS A PROTOCOL THAT EVERYONE COME TO THE TABLE THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN IT LEAVES THE JUDGE IN THE POSITION OF HAVING TO. TAKE THE ADVICE OF LIBERTY THE CONTRACTOR WITH THE STATE HOSPITALS AND TO MAKE A DETERMINATION- WHEN I TALK ABOUT TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY IT IS HAVING EVERY STAKEHOLDER AT THE TABLE PLAYING THEIR ROLE. OUGHT TO DETERMINE THAT THE ACCOUNTABILITY IS TAKEN AND THAT THERE IS TRANSPARENCY ON BEHALF OF THE PUBLIC. AND THE RIVER TAKE REPRESENTATION IS THERE FOR THE INDIVIDUAL BEING CONSIDERED SO. WHILE IT THE ISSUE IS IT MAYBE IT SHOULD BE MANDATED BECAUSE PEOPLE NEED TO COME TO THE TABLE AND THE SECOND PIECE SO IN RESPONSE WE DON'T THINK THERE'S A CONFLICT WE WILL CONTINUE TO TAKE A LOOK AT THIS. WE WANT BETTER OUTCOMES- IN THE PROCESS AND WE THINK- THIS GETS TO THAT ISSUE AND I APPRECIATE THE QUESTION CENTER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND- A PROVIDES A LITTLE MORE OF AN INSIGHT INTO THE BALANCE AND I AM A HUGE ADVOCATE OF HAVING ALL STAKEHOLDERS TO THE TABLE. TO MAKE. A BETTER DECISION THANK YOU- WE HAVE MOTION FROM- SENATOR COM LONGER- AND- BEFORE I ASK YOU TO CLOSE I WILL AND I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL AND I WOULD RAISE. THE CONCERN THAT THE DA SAID THAT THEY- DO YOU KNOW DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO VARIOUS INFORMATION WHICH I'M ASSUMING IS A HIP A RULE. AND THEIR SUGGESTION THAT IT BE A LOCAL GOVERNMENT INSTEAD A LOCAL GOVERNMENT WILL HAVE THE SAME SITUATION AS THE DA'S SO GIVEN FROM MY POINT OF VIEW IT IS THE DH ROLE TO ENFORCE THE LAW THIS IS THE LAW. AND YOUR CHANGE THAT IS BEING RECOMMENDED HERE. IS NOT. A OTHER THAN BROADENING THE PROCESS AND- CLARIFYING SOME THINGS IT IS STILL. IT IS STILL- FIVE. IN FACT IT DID IT DID WERE NOT FUN DOING IN THIS BILL THE ESSENTIAL- CONRAD PROCESS OR CON WRAP STATUTE SO I THINK THAT- THE WELL I THINK THE DA'S OFFICE THREE ENTITLED TO THEIR OPINION AND THEIR OBJECTION I DON'T THINK IT HAS. THE TYPE OF MERIT THAT THE- PUT FORWARD IN THEIR TESTIMONY SO ON. CENTER RACK AND YOU MAY CLOSE THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND COLLEAGUES I WOULD JUST SAY WE NEED TO MAKE THIS PROCESS BETTER I YOU WILL SEE A NUMBER OF BILLS OUT OF SAN DIEGO COUNTY BECAUSE THE PROCESS FAILED THE COMMUNITY. AND THE SYSTEM- COULD HAVE WORKED BETTER WITH ALL STAKEHOLDERS AT THE TABLE MAKING A DETERMINATION AND- THE WORST CASE SCENARIO IS WERE PUT IN A CONSTITUTIONAL BEHIND AND PEOPLE ARE RELEASED. AND THAT IS NOT GOOD FOR THE COMMUNITY IT'S NOT GOOD FOR PUBLIC SAFETY IS NOT GOOD FOR THE INDIVIDUAL I THINK WE ARE WORKING VERY HARD TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE A BETTER OUTCOME AND PROCESS. OF FOR THE COMMUNITY AND FOR THE SYSTEM I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. ALL RIGHT- GOOD NEWS CONSULTANT YOU PLEASE CALL THE ROLL THE- MOTION IS TO PASS BUT REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS. SB TEN THIRTY FOUR DO PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS SKINNER HI SKINNER I INTRO BOGE. TURBO GUY KAMARG- KAMAGRA BUY. RIGHT THAT BILL WILL HAVE A PUT ON- CALL- IT HAS THREE VOTES WILL PUT ON CALL FOR ABSENT UNDER MEMBER TO RETURN AND WE WILL NOW MOVE TO S. B. EIGHT FORTY ONE. SENATOR JONES. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS. ON THE- SUBJECT IS SEXUALLY VIOLENT PREDATORS WILL CONTINUE AS A SENATE BILL EIGHT FORTY ONE WHICH PROVIDES ADDITIONAL OVERSIGHT TO THE PROCESS BY WHICH IS SEXUALLY VIOLENT PREDATOR GETS PLACED BACK INTO THE COMMUNITY. A SEXUALLY VIOLENT PREDATOR AS SVP IS AN INDIVIDUAL CONVICTED OF A SEXUALLY VIOLENT OFFENSE AND DIAGNOSED WITH A MENTAL DISORDER THAT CAUSES THEM TO BE A DANGER TO OTHERS. AND WITH A HIGH LIKELIHOOD TO RE OFFEND. WHEN STP IS DETERMINED TO BE READY FOR RELEASED FROM CIVIL COMMITMENT UNDER THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE HOSPITALS A PROCESS KNOWN AS CON REFEREE. BEGINS WHICH THE SENATE PRO TEM JUST ELOQUENTLY- EXPLAINED. CURRENTLY THE DEPARTMENT USES A CONTRACTOR TO EXECUTE THE ENTIRE CONRAD PROCESS TAKING LITTLE TO NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE OVERSIGHT. THIS BILL MAKES SEVERAL IMPORTANT UPDATES TO THE CONRAD PROCESS. FIRST SB EIGHT FORTY ONE WILL REQUIRE THE HIGHEST PRIORITY FOR ALL POTENTIAL AS P. P. COMMUNITY PLACEMENTS TO BE PUBLIC SAFETY. ADDITIONALLY EIGHT FORTY ONE REQUIRES THE DEPARTMENT TO TAKE A BIGGER ROLE IN THE CONRAD. BY REQUIRING THE DEPARTMENT TO APPROVE ANY LEASE- RESIDENTIAL LEASE THAT THE VENDOR SIGNS BEFORE IT IS SIGNED. THISWILL HELP CURB THE ISSUE OF THE VENDOR BEING COMMITTED TO A LEASE BEFORE JUDGE HAS APPROVED THE PLACEMENT AND S. AND US BEING STUCK WITH THE PAYMENT IF THE PLACEMENT IS DENIED. FINALLY THIS BILL WILL PROVIDE ADDITIONAL TRANSPARENCY BY REQUIRING THE DEPARTMENT TO POLLUTION ANNUAL PUBLIC REPORT ABOUT PLACEMENTS. AND REQUIRING SEVERAL STATE AGENCIES TO ACCESS PUBLIC LANDS IN THEIR CONTROL THE MAY BE ADEQUATE AND THE PROPER USE FOR SEP PLACEMENTS. THESE SMALL CHANGES WILL AFFORD MORE OVERSIGHT ON THE PLACEMENT TO PLACEMENT PROCESS AND HELP ENSURE MORE APPROPRIATE PLACEMENTS OF S. V. PEAS.

NOT SURE WHAT'S HAPPENING IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY BUT- I CAN I CAN SUSPECT- THESE ARE SOME OF THE HARDEST ISSUES AND I WILL TELL YOU WHEN I WAS A- MEMBER OF THE- SAN FRANCISCO BOARD OF SUPERVISORS REPRESENTING A VERY. AGGRESSIVE DISTRICT. THERE WAS A PROPOSAL TO OPEN UP. THIS NOT FOR SEX LEVINE PREDATORS OR FOR LOWER LEVEL SEX OFFENDERS A TREATMENT. CENTER AGAIN FOR LOW LEVELS NOT THE BOND PRESSURES- SEX OFFENDER TREATMENT. FACILITIES WERE VERY REPUTABLE NONPROFIT IN ONE OF THE MOST PROGRESSIVE. NEIGHBORHOODS IN MY PROGRESSIVE. DISTRICT AND- THE. PITCHFORKS HIM OUT AND I. IT WAS FOR THE MOST AND CAN MEET- BUT I EVER THIS. ABSOLUTE ELECTED OFFICIALS AND- AND LEFT THE SAN FRANCISCO- SO I CAN ONLY IMAGINE IN TERMS OF YOUR PLACEMENT IN ONE WHO HAS BEEN COMBINED AS- AN ADJUDICATED AS A SEXUALLY VIOLENT PREDATOR- WHAT YOU KNOW THAT THE TENSION RESCUE BECAUSE IN THE COMMUNITY SO I. COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND THAT AND I. UNDERSTAND WHY YOU'RE PEOPLE'S DO YOU KNOW DEEP CONCERN- AT THE SAME TIME- WHEN SOMEONE HAS DONE THEIR TIME IN PRISON AND YOUR PRISON SENTENCES FOR SEXUALLY VIOLENT PEOPLE ARE CONVICTED OF THESE. VERY HIGH LEVEL OFFENSES- ARE NOT. LIGHT THESE ARE HEAVY SENTENCES. AND THE PERSON HAS BEEN RELEASED AND I WAS DONE HOWEVER MANY ADDITIONAL YEARS AND CAN BE A LONG PERIOD OF TIME. A COMBINED POST SENTENCE AS SEXUALLY VIOLENT PREDATOR AND THAT HAS GONE THROUGH THE PROCESS AND THEN DETERMINED BY. MEANT BY PSYCHIATRISTS OR PSYCHOLOGISTS IN THE COURT- AS HAVING- ISN'T NO LONGER BEING DANGEROUS THEY'VE DONE THEIR PRISON TIME THEY'VE GONE THROUGH HOWEVER MANY YEARS OF CONFINED. THREE MEN AND THEY'VE BEEN JUDICATA- I WAS NO LONGER BEING A THREAT- AND THEN BAY YEAR WITH CITIZENS ARE WITHOUT. HARM ARE GOING INTO THE COMMUNITY AND THEY'RE TYPICALLY GOING BACK TO THE- COUNTY WHERE THEY WERE FROM BEFORE AND THERE ARE CERTAIN STANDARDS FOR ONE THEY'RE SENT TO OTHER COUNTIES- BUT- YOU KNOW IT AT. SOME POINT BACK TO THE HOUSE BUTTE- AND IF AND WHEN WE CREATE ALL THESE. RESTRICTIONS AND I'M NOT PUTTING THIS ON YOUR BILL BECAUSE THERE BEEN OTHER BILLS AND BALLOT MEASURES IT YOU KNOW MAKING IT IMPOSSIBLE TO LIVE IN CERTAIN CITIES. YOUR WITHIN TWO THOUSAND FEET OF A PARK OR- OUR SCHOOL- IF SOMEONE THEY JUST BECOME HOMELESS- AND THEN THEY'RE- MORE LIKELY TO RESET OF EIGHT- AS OPPOSED TO MAKING SURE THAT HOUSING. IS TO EMPLOYMENT. AND SO FORTH SO- I UNDERSTAND THEM MOTIVATION. BEHIND THIS BILL I DON'T THINK IT'S ABOUT MOTIVATION I THINK YOUR- REPRESENTING YOUR CONSTITUENTS- BUT I'D BILLS JUST THERE THERE'S JUST TOO MUCH IN THIS BILL.

ELOQUENT ON HERE BUT I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND TO IN ORDER TO BE- OBJECTIVE IN AND FAIR IN IN OUR ANALYSIS BUT THIS YEAR THAT- A PATIENT. ROOM YOU KNOW KNOWN AS A CONDITIONAL RELEASE CONRAD A COURT DETERMINES THAT A PATIENT CAN BE SAFELY PLACE IN THE COMMITTEE WITH STRICT CONDITIONS- STRICT CONDITIONS OUT THERE EVEN THOUGH THEY HAVE SERVED THEIR TIME AND HAVE RECEIVED TREATMENT SENT SOME OF THESE INDIVIDUALS. STILL HAVE TO BE SUPERVISED AND- SENATOR I CAN'T THAT I DON'T HAVE I WAS JUST TRYING TO FIND THESE THE LIST REALLY QUICK ON HERE BUT SOME OF THE- THINGS THAT HAVE TO BE FOLLOWED IN OVER IN ORDER FOR THEM TO BE ACTUALLY IT BEAM. I'M PUBLIC AND I'M NOT SURE IF WE HAVE SOMEBODY HERE THAT HOUSES EXPERTISE BUT- SOME OF THEM HAVE TO BE MONITOR THEY HAVE TO BE SUPERVISED THEY HAVE TO HAVE- ANYWAY. WE'RE SAYING IS. THERE'S CERTAIN THE COMPONENTS THAT COME INTO PLAY. WHEN SOMEONE IS RETURN INTO- A COMMUNITY THAT IS THAT IS THAT. THAT IS NEEDED IN ORDER TO BE PLACING HIM IN RESEARCH EVEN THOUGH THEY HAVE SERVED THEIR TIME THERE STILL HAS TO BE CERTAIN PHONES OR ELEMENTS WITHIN WITHIN- WITHIN THAT RELEASE CONDITIONS THAT NEED TO BE REALLY SO- I JUST THOUGHT I'D MENTION IT BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT JUST CURED AND PUT INTO PLACE THERE'S STILL SOME THINGS THAT NEED TO BE- IN PLACE FOR THAT- SO I ACTUALLY APPRECIATE THIS BILL- S.

RIGHT NOW THAT SAN DIEGO COUNTY IS ON HIGH ALERT ON THIS IS BECAUSE OF TWO PARTICULAR. REALLY SEES THAT- THE- THE- STATE CONTRACTOR. I TRIED THREE DIFFERENT TIMES FOR DIFFERENT TIMES. IN THREE DIFFERENT IN FOUR DIFFERENT NEIGHBORHOODS IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY TO PLACES TO. REALLY SEES THAT- IT'S CONTRARY TO THE POINT OF THEM BEING CURED AND ADJUDICATED THAT THEY'RE SAFE. I ACTUALLY THE WITNESS IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL ACTUALLY TAKES OFFENSE TO SOME OF THE COMMENTS THAT HE MADE REGARDING ABOUT THEM BEING NON DANGEROUS AND ADJUDICATED TO BE- SAFER RELEASED BOTH OF THESE. RELEASEES HAD RE IF BEEN RELEASED PRIOR AND RE OFFENDED- THEY HAVE A RECORD OF GOING INTO PRISON AND COMING OUT OF PRISON AND GOING BACK INTO PRION UNDER THE S. V. P. PROGRAM. WHAT A LOT OF PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THIS S. B. P. AT THIS IS JUST NOT A MADE UP TERM THAT THE NEWS MADE UP OR THE LEGEND YOU KNOW THE- PROCESS OF. IT'S A IT'S A LEGAL TERM IT'S A IT'S A LEGAL PROSECUTE PROSECUTORIAL TERM THAT IS PLACED ON THESE PARTICULAR OFFENDERS. BECAUSE THEIR CRIME IS SO HEINOUS. AND THEIR VICTIMS ARE SO. IT DAMAGE PHYSICALLY AND MENTALLY SOME OF THEM MURDERED- ALL OF THEM RATES TO SOME DEGREE SYSTEM AND LEGISLATIVE PROCESS HAVE THESE HAS DETERMINED THE S. V. P. IS THE WORST OF THE WORST SCIENCE AND INTERVIEWS WITH S. V. PEAS THAT THEM THEY THEMSELVES SAY. I AM NOT CURABLE IS PERMANENT AND AT AND IS IT IS A PROBLEM AND WHAT WHEN YOU GET SAID SOMEBODY HAD MET THAT- YOU KNOW THAT THAT'S A PRETTY BIG. THANK TO ME US SENATOR COUNTY AND THREE OF THOSE NEIGHBORHOODS IN MY DISTRICT THAT THEY'VE TRIED TO PLACE THESE. SB PEAS AND THE PURPOSE FOR MY BILL WHICH IS A BIPARTISAN BILLS CO AUTHORED BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER COOPER. IN CENTER HUESO AND SEVERAL OTHER- SINNERS. I. THE CONTRACTOR ONCE THE STATE TURNS THE ISRAELI SEES OVER TO THE CONTRACTOR THIS STATE HAS WASHED ITS HANDS OF THE OF THE SITUATION OF THE PROBLEM AND IS NO LONGER. TAKES RESPONSIBILITY FOR WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE NEIGHBORHOODS. FOUR TIMES FOUR TIMES THIS CONTRACTOR TRIED TO PLACE BOTH OF THESE REALLY SEES IN THE SAME HOME. IN A NEIGHBORHOOD. NOT A RURAL NEIGHBORHOOD NOT A SECLUDED NEIGHBORHOOD. A NEIGHBORHOOD WITH CHILDREN ON THE VERY SAME STREET THAT THE CONTRACTOR AT LEAST TO THE HOUSE. A NEIGHBORHOOD THAT WITHIN WALKING DISTANCE OF ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS. M. PRESCHOOLS WHICH AS WAS STATED BY THE SAN DIEGO DA ONE OF THE REALLY SEES FIVE HUNDRED VICTIMS. MINOR VICTIMS FIVE HUNDRED VICTIMS. FOUR EIGHT. PROVIDE HE PERFORMED VIOLENT SEXUAL ACTS ON FIVE HUNDRED. CHILDREN. LET THAT SINK IN THE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. A PERSON CAN COMMIT THOSE KIND OF CRIMES AND STILL BE RELEASED FROM PRISON. THAT PERSON SHOULD NEVER BE RELEASED FROM THAT WOULD BE MY YOU KNOW IF I WAS WRITING THIS V. P. LOCK- AND HAD MY ENTIRE WAY IF I WAS KING FOR A DAY. THESE GUYS WOULD NEVER GET OUT OF PRISON AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT THE COMMUNITIES EXPECT. ABOUT WHEN THESE GUYS FINALLY GET CONVICTED AND SENT TO PRISON. AND SENT AWAY. THE URGENCY. ADDRESSING THE WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. IS THAT THESE PLACEMENTS WERE IN AREAS WHERE THERE'S HUNDREDS OF CHILDREN. THAT'S THE URGENCY LET ALONE THAT THERE'S ONLY SIXTEEN ABSOLUTELY RATHER I'M SORRY NOT YOUR CLOTHES BUT NO I KNOW I FISH NO I'M I'M IF SOMEONE IF SOMEONE COMMITTED VIOLENT SEXUAL ACTS AND FIVE HUNDRED PEOPLE. WHY DID YOUR DA NOT SEEK TO SEND THAT PERSON AWAY FOREVER BECAUSE THAT TO ME IS NOT ABOUT. THE SECTION BY A PREDATOR STATUTE IF SOMEONE TRULY COMMITTED SUCH VIOLENT SEXUAL ACTS AGAINST FIVE HUNDRED PEOPLE. I DON'T SEE ANY COUNTY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. NOT PUTTING THAT PERSON AWAY FOREVER- AND SAN DIEGO COUNTY DA IS NOT EXACTLY PROBABLY A- YOU KNOW. BUT WHEN YOU'RE AN ATHLETE YOU CAN THE MOST LEFT WING DA WOULD PUT PUT PUT THAT PERSON AWAY FOREVER- SO I DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT TO ME IS NOT A SEXUALLY VIOLENT PREDATOR STATUTE ISSUE. THAT'S AN ISSUE OF IT THE L. WHY SOMEONE LIKE THAT WOULD NOT BE PROSECUTED IN A WAY. TO PUT THEM AWAY FOREVER. IF I IF YOU'RE- I'M JUST GOT. MISTRUST AND I WAS JUST ON THE LINE IF YOU'D LIKE TO ASK HIM THAT QUESTION MAY BE AS ANSWER OR I CAN GET BACK TO. I WOULD HAPPY RESPONDED CENTER LEADERS QUESTION IN GENERAL WE ARE EACH ISSUE OF STATUE OF LIMITATIONS AND DISCLOSURE SO PART OF THE TREATMENT THAT SEXUAL BUYING PRINTERS AT WHICH SHE WHY THE STATE HOSPITAL BECAUSE THEY WILL COME TO GRIPS WITH WHAT MAKES THEM BY AND VIOLATE IN THEIR PAST HISTORY AND SOME OF THE SCHOOLS WHAT THE HISTORY WAS WHERE THERE IS NO ABILITY TOGO BACK AND PROSECUTOR CRIME FROM THE PAST- THAT IS- IF THEY'RE STATUTES LIMITATION PROBLEMS NORTH THERE. WILL DISCLOSURE TO A PROSECUTING ANTI DEPRESSANTS MORE TREATMENT YEAH WITH RESPECT TO GETTING THAT IT SHOULD FROM THE OFFENDER. THAT ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS WIENER- YEAH I HAVE A I APPRECIATE THAT CLARK I JUST THINK IT'S IT THAT'S IF SOMEONE OFFENSE THEY THERE ARE THERE ARE TOOLS TO DEAL WITH THAT AND WE DID TERM THAT WE REMOVE THE STATUTE ON READY FOR WE EXTENDED A- AT. THIS POINT IT'S REMOVING AB RIGHT BUT WE EXTENDED IT CHILDREN IT'S BEEN X. IS SOMEONE THAT HAPPENED WHEN THEY WERE YOUNG IT'S BEEN EXTENDED TILL. YOU'RE IN YOUR THIRTIES FOR YEARS THAT'S THAT WE DID LIKE TEN OTHER YEARS IS. CURRENTLY IS NOSE STARTS IT WAS WE REMOVE THE STATUE LIMITATIONS FOR RAPE WAS AT THE- YES OKAY THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU THANK YOU AT ZERO NINE FIVE ACTUALLY APPRECIATE YOU ASKING THE QUESTION AND INTERPRETATION I DON'T MIND YOU. YOU'RE KIND ENOUGH TO MAKE THE MOTIONS ARE MINE GENERATING I'LL WRAP UP IN IN THANK YOU AND I WANT TO SEE THANK YOU TO THE WITNESSES IN SUPPORT- THEY DID A GREAT JOB- YOU KNOW I WOULD WELCOME THE- L. A. PUBLIC DEFENDERS AND THEIR MEMBERS IN THEIR STATION THERE SO- IF THEY BELIEVE IN THEIR COMMENTS SO MUCH. AND THAT THIS IS NOT A PROBLEM AND IT'S NOT URGENT. WHY I WALK IN THE BUILDING EIGHTY YOU ON ON THEIR PROPERTY AND WELCOME THESE FOLKS TO MOVE INTO THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD AND MOVE INTO THEIR HOME. AND THEY KEEP AN EYE ON. THE PURPOSE OF MY BILL IS IT IS RIGHT. NOT IT IS VERY ROBUST MY BILL IS VERY ROBUST I ADMIT THAT- THERE'S A LOT IN IT- AND THAT'S PURPOSELY LISO BECAUSE WE WANT TO FLUSH OUT A LOT OF THESE ISSUES. I WOULD LIKE- IF THE BILL DOESN'T PASS TODAY RECONSIDERATION. TO HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO RE ENGAGE WITH THE MEMBERS AND COME UP WITH A SOLUTION THAT DOES WORK. THE PURPOSE OF MY BILL TODAY IS TO PROTECT. RESIDENTS ANDERSON FAMILIES CHILDREN WOMEN ABOUT THE ENTIRE STATE YES THIS HAS BECOME A SAN DIEGO POINTED ISSUE BUT IT'S A IT'S A STATE ISSUE AND- I THINK BASED ON THE ROBUSTNESS OF THE MEMBERS ENGAGEMENT FROM THE SENATE DELEGATION AND THE BILLS THAT ARE BEING PRESENTED. THIS SHOULD BE IMPORTANT TO ALL OF US AND HEIGHTEN OUR ATTENTION TO THE WHOLE THING- ONE OF THE- THINGS THAT MY BILL DOES SUPPORT A PROPOSED IS THAT. THE SECTION ABOUT PREDATORS BE PLACED ON STATE PROPERTY THAT'S THE PURPOSE OF THE REPORTS FROM THE VARIOUS AGENCIES. PRIOR GOVERNORS HAVE ORDERED THOSE PLACEMENTS THEY SEEM TO HAVE WORKED IN THE PAST AND WE THINK THAT THEY COULD WORK AGAIN AND WITH THAT I WOULD ASK YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU SENATOR JONES WE HAVE A MOTION- BY SENATOR WIENER- AND- TO MOVE THE BELL. AND THE MOTION IS DUE PASSED BUT FIRST RE REFER. OR THE JONAS SORRY CENTER MARKET I SO I'M WONDERING HOW. YES THE WHOLE THING'S BEEN OUT OF WORK SO IF. I FEEL LIKE LIFE IS OUT OF ORDER- SO BUT THANK YOU I'M- THE MOTION IS DUE PATH YES SO- I FEEL LIKE I WAS ALSO GOING TO ASK THE SAME QUESTION THAT SENATOR WIENER ASK BECAUSE MY CONFUSION WAS THAT- IF SOMEONE IS. CURRENTLY PRESENTS A CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER THEN THEY ARE NOT RELEASED- BUT THEN ALSO YOUR AND THEN I JUST HER I FEEL LIKE I JUST HEARD YOU SAY THAT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT YOU'RE ALSO RECOMMENDING IS ESSENTIALLY LIKE A STATE PENAL COLONY FOR FOLKS TO BE ON. NOT NEXT NON ARE NOT NECESSARILY COLONY AT AND- BUT A PLACEMENT ON STATE PROPERTY. WHERE THEY CAN BE. DETERMINED THAT THAT'S A SAFER PLACE FOR THEM TO BE PLACED I'M NOT. POSING THAT WE PUT THEM ALL IN THE SAME PLACE- LIKE A CALLING KNOW THAT. THAT'S NOT MY INTENT. OKAY THE OTHER THING THAT I WHEN I WHEN READING IT. IT SAYS THAT THE VIOLENT PREDATORS HAVE. HISTORICALLY BEEN DONE IT PLACE PLACE HAS BEEN HISTORICALLY DONE IN SECRET AND DECEPTIVE WAYS BY THE STATE INTRIGUED. AND CONFUSED BY THAT BECAUSE IT. SUGGESTS THAT THE STATE IS INTENTIONALLY TRYING TO PLACE PEOPLE- IN AREAS THAT PRESENT A DANGER PROBABLY TO THEM BUT ALSO TO NEIGHBORHOODS WHERE THEY ARE RESIDING. AND THERE WAS AN INTENTION OUT THERE DID THERE'S A AND AN INFERRED INTENTIONALITY TO THAT STATEMENT. AND I DON'T FEEL LIKE THAT IS. THE CASE ARM. AND I DIDN'T KNOW IF MAYBE SOMEONE COULD EXPLAIN WHY THAT. IN THERE AND THE ASSUMPTION BEHIND THEM- AND THEN ALSO BASED ON WHAT I WAS READING IN THE ANALYSIS. THE IT SEEMS TO ME AND MAYBE I'M WRONG. BUT IF THIS IS ABOUT COUNTIES. AND IF YOU HAVE A BOARD THAT IS AGAINST PLACEMENTS OR MIGHT BE AGAINST A PARTICULAR PERSON THEY COULD CONCEIVABLY DRAG THIS WHOLE PROCESS OUT IN THE PEOPLE WOULD NEVER GET PLACE I THINK I CAN ADDRESS BOTH QUESTIONS OKAY WITH ONE EXPLANATION I LITERALLY. WHEN THE STATE TURNS THE RELEASE SEE OVER TO THE CONTRACTOR. THE STATE AT THAT POINT TIME BRAUNTON SUPPORTS IT PURPOSES QUITS PAYING ATTENTION TO WHAT'S GOING ON SO THEY- WASH THEIR HANDS OF THE SITUATION. THE CONTRACTOR THEN GOES OUT AND LEASES A HOME. AND THEN- ANNOUNCES OR WHATEVER THAT THEY'RE GONNA PLACE THIS SEXUALLY VIOLENT PREDATOR IN THIS PARTICULAR HOME AT THAT POINT TIME THAT'S WIN THE COUNTY THEY COMMUNITY HEARS ABOUT IT THAT'S WHEN THE NEIGHBORS HERE ABOUT IT THAT'S WHEN YOU AND I HEAR ABOUT IT FROM OUR CONSTITUENTS THAT ARE CONCERNED ABOUT IT AND OUR PHONES LIGHT UP. AND OUR DISTRICT STAFF ARE YOU KNOW TAKING THE TASK AT EVERY EVENT THAT THEY GO TO AS TO WHY THIS IS HAPPENING. AND WHAT WE WANT TO CHANGE IS THAT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THE BILL PROPOSES TO DO TO FIX THAT IS BEFORE THE CONTRACTOR CAN SIGN THE LEASE. THE DIRECTOR OF STATE HOSPITALS HAS TO APPROVE IT. WHICH THAT IS NOT A STEP CURRENTLY TODAY. IS THAT YOUR CLOSING STATEMENT SENATOR JONES I'M WELL. YES AND NO. I MEAN I'M TRYING TO ANSWER LISTENER CALM WATERS QUESTIONS YES. THE APOLLO MORE TIMES IF WE NEED TO. I WANT TO YES QUESTIONS. THANK YOU FOR THAT ANSWER THE QUESTION. YES THEY DO IT DID IT OKAY AND AGAIN I WILL THIS MY FINAL. CLOSING STATEMENT IS IF IT FAILS TODAY AND I'M ALLOWED RECONSIDERATION I WOULD LOVE TO RE ENGAGE WITH THE MEMBERS I AM FIND OUT. WHAT ROBUST SOLUTION WE CAN COME UP WITH TOGETHER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH CENTERS JONES- COUNCIL WILL YOU PLEASE CALL THE ROLL ON SB EIGHT FORTY ONE SB EIGHT FORTY ONE DO PASSED TO APPROPRIATIONS CHAU BOGUE I TROUBLE GUY COME LONGER. COM LONGER KNOWS SKINNER WINNER WINNER NOW. ALL RIGHT WE HAVE A ONE VOTE WE WILL PUT THAT BILL AND CALL FOR MISSING MEMBERS. THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATOR JONES. WE HAVE CENTER BATES- PRESENTING S. B. THIRTEEN THIRTY THREE. WELCOME SENATOR BASE YOU MAY PRESENT S. B. NUMBER. THIRTEEN THIRTY THREE THIRTEEN THIRTY THREE WHICH IS ANOTHER SEXUALLY VIOLENT PREDATOR- PROBLEM PROPOSAL- SO GOOD MORNING ARE MISSED HEARING MEMBERS LA I'M CERTAINLY PLEASED TO PRESENT SB THIRTEEN THIRTY THREE WHICH THIS IS A BILL THAT LOOKS TO PROVIDE MORE TRANSPARENCY FAIRNESS AND SAFETY TO THE RELEASE OF S. B. S. SEXUALLY VIOLENT PREDATORS INTO OUR COMMUNITIES ARE MOST AND YOU'VE HEARD A BIT OF DISCUSSION ABOUT SAN DIEGO CERTAINLY I REPRESENT- THE NORTH COUNTY PART OF SAN DIEGO AND MORE S. V. PEAS ARE PENDING RELEASE THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND THEY CURRENTLY RESIDE THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN RELEASED RESIDE IN SAN DIEGO. FINDING PLACEMENT FOR THEM HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THE SAN DIEGO COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS VOTED UNANIMOUSLY TO OPPOSE FURTHER PLACEMENTS OF THEM UNDER THE CURRENT PROCESS AND THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL IS FOCUSING ON IS THE PROCESS THE ACTION WAS IN RESPONSE TO PLACEMENT OF TWO DIFFERENT S. V. PEAS AND I BELIEVE THOSE WERE THE ONES THAT SENATOR JOHNSON SPEAKING OF IN RANCHO BERNARDO AND MOUNT HELIX AND WE'RE CONSTRUED CONSIDERED A THREAT TO PUBLIC SAFETY. CERTAINLY OUTCRIES FROM THE LOCAL COMMUNITY SAN DIEGO COUNTY AWFUL ALSO RECENTLY EXPERIENCED ATTEMPTS TO PLACE S. V. PEAS FROM OTHER ANOTHER JURISDICTION WITHIN ITS JURISDICTION ENOUGH ANOTHER POINT I IN TERMS OF FAIRNESS TRANSPARENCY IN TERMS OF ARE REVIEWING ALL WHERE THE PLACEMENTS WILL BE MADE THE JUDGES DENIED THOSE PLACEMENTS AFTER IMMENSE PUBLIC OUT CREE OUTCRY AND EFFORTS TO RELEASE. S. V. PEAS WILL CONTINUE TO FACE PUBLIC SCRUTINY UNLESS OF THE CURRENT LAW IS REFORM THERE IS CURRENTLY NO STATUTORY REQUIREMENT IN THE WELFARE AND INSTITUTIONS CODE FOR THE RECORDS FROM SUPPORTING A FINDING AND EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH IS THE FINDING THAT IS MADE WHEN SOMEONE WHO IS AN S. V. P. IS- REFUSED TO A COUNTY DIFFERENT FROM THE ONE IN WHICH- THEY WERE. SENTENCED IT SEEKS TO PROVIDE I. AND VERY TO THE PLAY PRICE BY. FULL DISK. WHEN A ACCOUNT ATTEMPTS TO. AN S. B. P. INTO ANOTHER COUNTY IT ALSO ALLOWS THE COUNTY TO SEEK AN APPELLATE COURT'S REVIEW IF THEY ARE ORDERED TO FIND PLACEMENT. THAT COMES FROM ANOTHER COUNTY. THAT BEING SAID THE OPPOSITION DID HAVE GREAT CONCERNS WITH PROVISIONS IN THE BILL THAT RESTRICTED WHERE IN SB PEAK PLACE. FOLLOWING UP THEIR RELEASE SO IN RESPONSE I'VE INTRODUCED AUTHORS AMENDMENTS THAT WOULD REMOVE ANY MENTION OF GEOGRAPHICAL RESTRICTIONS UPON THE RELEASE FOR. ODD AND THAT'S INCLUDED IN THE BILL IT WILL FOCUS SIMPLY BE ON ABILITY TO PROVIDE PROPER TRANSPARENCY AND NOTICE FOR SVB PLACEMENTS. THE SAN DIEGO COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE IS A SPONSOR OF THIS MEASURE AND WE HAVE CHIEF DEPUTY PATRICK ESPINOSA WITH THE COUNTY'S DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE HE'S HERE. TO ANSWER ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS AND HE IS A PRIMARY WITNESS. THANK YOU SENATOR BATES WILL NOT MOVE ON TO OUR WITNESSES- IN SUPPORT WITH THEIR LEAD AND WILL BEGIN WITH THEIR LEAD. WITNESS PAT ESPINOSA DISTRICT ATTORNEY. GOOD MORNING TO THE CHAIR AND LOOKED MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE I'M PATRICK ESPINOSA CHIEF DEPUTY APES ANNUAL COUNTING ON BEHALF OF. DISTRICT ATTORNEY SUMMER STEPHAN MANY OF CALIFORNIA'S SIXTEEN ESCAPEES WHO ON SUPERVISED RELEASE FROM THE STATE HOSPITAL. ARE PLACED CURRENTLY USING A COUNTY MORE STPS ARE PENDING RELEASE THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. FINDING PLACE FOR ASKING S. B. S. BECAUSE- ONE MORE DIFFICULT THE CONTRACT THIS DEPARTMENT AT HOSPITALS IS RESPONSIBLE FOR NOTIFYING THE COUNTY OF DOMICILE WHERE THE S. B. P. RESIDES PRIOR TO INCARCERATION. ACCORDING TO THE RELEASE PLACEMENT AND CONTRACTING WITH LIBERTY TO OVERSEE THEIR TREATMENT RECENTLY. DECENNIAL COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS VOTED UNANIMOUSLY TO OPPOSE ANY FURTHER PLACEMENTS AFFECTED BY ACCREDITORS UNDER THE CURRENT PROCESS THIS ACTION WAS IN RESPONSE TO THE PLACEMENT OF TWO DIFFERENT SB PEAS IN RANCHO BERNARDO AD NOT HELIX. WHICH WAS PERCEIVED AS A THREAT TO PUBLIC SAFETY. SAN DIEGO COUNTY ALSO RECENTLY EXPERIENCED ATTEMPTS TO PLACE AN STP FROM ANOTHER COUNTY ANOTHER JURISDICTION WITHIN OUR COUNTY SANTA COUNTY- JUDGES DENIED PREVIOUS PLACEMENTS AFTER A MATCH PUBLIC OUTCRY. AND THAT'S ONE PROVISION OF THIS BILL SB THIRTEEN THIRTY THREE AND THAT'S THE PROVISION ABOUT EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES AND THE WAY THAT WORKS IS IF EIGHT. FINDS EXTRAORDINARY EXTRA CIRCUMVENT EXIST THAT COUNTY DOES NOT HAVE TO PLACE YEAH SB P. IN THEIR OWN COUNTY INSTEAD THEY CAN REQUIRED THAT ACTUALLY P. ET TO BE HONEST PROVIDES RELEASED ANY OTHER COUNTY IN ACTUALLY EIGHT AREA. WILL REPORT AN EARLIER THE SBI. TWENTY THREE THREE SIXTY. TO FIX IT OR NOT WAY. BECAUSE ONE EIGHT. FINDS WHICH YOU'RE LOOKING. SO THAT THEY WILL PLACE YEAH TO BE IN THEIR OWN- THE COUNTY ULTIMATELY ASKED BY THAT ACTUALLY BE GIVEN AFTER TABLE NOT IN THE- IT'S NOT HARD TO. THAT TO SEE IS MADE. SB THREE THIRTY WHICH TO FIX THAT. SO THAT THOSE RECORDS- THE EVIDENCE THAT. THE JUDGES. THAT EXPORTER CERTAIN. WOULD BE PREVENTED PRESENTED TO AND CLOSE TO THE COUNTY THIS ASPECT ACTUALLY P. SHORTEN. TIME AFTER SECOND HALF IT WOULD GIVE THAT. THAT COUNTY THAT TO FIND OUT FOR THAT BE A BILL TO GO TO THEIR COURT EVICTING IT'S A PRO. FIFTY THREE THAT DOES THAT THAT FIND- EXTRA SIX. WHAT DO. ALL PLACES IN THAT COUNTY TO FIND A PLACEMENT FOR ACTUALLY DECOMMITTED FROM THEIR JURISDICTIONS SO THAT'S ONE AREA OF PERFORMANCE IN SB THIRTEEN THIRTY THREE. ANOTHER EARLY A PERFORM IS THE CONCEPT OF WHAT YOU DO WITH A NASTY P. WHO'S PLACE TO SUPERVISE BUT IT'S INSTALLING THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS. ORDERED BE GRANTED AND PLACED. ON S. B. I WAS RELEASED YES THE PEOPLE TO AGREE TO TURN YOU CAN WITH THE OFFENSE STAYED HOT AND LET ME HEALTHCARE PROVIDE THOSE TERMS CONDITIONS. OFTEN THE PROSECUTOR IT HAS NO ACCESS TO INFORMATION TO HOW THEY ARE PERFORMING ON WITH RESPECT TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS BECAUSE ALL THE PEOPLE IN A POSITION TO MONITOR THEM IT IS LIBERTY HEALTH CARE FOR STATE HOSPITALS BUT IN THOSE INSTANCES. WHERE STATE HOSPITAL DELIVERY HEALTH KERR SAID THERE'S A PROBLEM WITH THIS S. C. P. HE OR SHE WORKS WITH YOU MOST OF OUR MALES- IF THEY'RE NOT ON THE TERMS CONDITIONS. STATE HOSPITALS- LIBERTY CAN ASK THE LOCAL PROSECUTOR VIOLATE THIS OFFENDER TAKE AWAY THEIR TRADITIONAL BELIEFS BECAUSE THEY NEED TO BE BACK IN STATE HOSPITAL FOR THEIR OWN TREATMENT AND FOR THE SAFETY OF THE COMMUNITY WHEN THAT IS DONE THEN THE S. B. B. HAD BILITY TO HIDE BEHIND. THE PROTECTION OF CONFIDENTIAL CONFIDENTIALITY OF MEDICAL RECORDS AND PREVENT THOSE RECORDS WERE BEING PROVIDED TO THE PROSECUTOR WHO'S ASKED TO BRING. EIGHT WHEN REGULATION COURT TO REVOKE THE- THEIR- BASEMENT STATUS AND THAT'S VERY GOOD PROCESS WITH THIS LOSS IS BEING TO SIX TO DEAL WITH THIS BILL SEEKS TO DO IS BRING SENSE OF THAT PROCESS SO AND IN WE- THIS. EVERY PERSON PROVIDING STP THE END OF ENTITIES LIKE THE ACTUAL R. LIBERTY HEALTH CARE RECOGNIZE A RED. AND THEY BELIEVE TO BE WITH VOTE THAT THERE IS NO IMPEDIMENT AND THE LOSS OF THE BACON FROM THOSERECORDS MADE TREATMENT WHATEVER WRECKED YOU SHOULD THE RATHER.

ALSO THROUGH MY DISCUSSIONS WITH TREATMENT PROVIDERS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. HE THIRTEEN THIRTY THREE'S RECORD SHARING PROVISIONS RUN AFOUL OF PRIVACY PROTECTIONS AND WOULDN'T DANGER THE SAFETY HE AND MEDICAL PROGRESS CONDITIONALLY RELEASED PATIENTS. DIFFICULT THIS BILL WOULD- AT THE STATE AREAS OF THIS. THAT WOULD RUN AFOUL OF. AND FOR THERAPIST PATIENT PRIVILEGE. FIRST IT WOULD PROVIDE- IT WOULD REQUIRE A PROVISION OF THE PATIENT'S TREATMENT RECORDS TO PARTY THEN QUOTED THE DESIGNATED COUNTY A PLACEMENT IN QUOTE BEFORE OUT OF DOMICILE PLACE MAKING GRANTED. AND SOCKET THE BILL WOULD REQUIRE DISCLOSURE OF CONFIDENTIALLY PROTECTED MATERIAL TO THE COUNTY OF PLACEMENT OF CONGRESS CORRECT MIGHT BE AT AGE CORRECT OF OUTPACE TREATMENT. BOTH OF THE INFORMATION JEFF THE COMP. OF THE PAST ACT BY NOT ONLY. THE PER PSYCHOTHERAPY PATIENT PRIVILEGE BUT MORE AND- THREE H. IF ON. WHICH IN TURN CREATING GREATER. TOWARDS SYSTEM AND AFFECTED TREATMENT TOO SO WE COMMITTED PATIENTS. THE MORE DIFFICULT. MADE IT TO BRIDGE THE FACT THAT TREATMENT THE MORAL.

HELLO MY NAME IS KIMBERLY FOSTER AND I'M IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU. THERE ARE NO FURTHER LINES IN OPPOSITION PLEASE CONTINUE READING CHAIR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM MODERATOR AND THANK YOU TO ALL OUR SUPPORT OPPOSITION JUSTICE WILL NOT BRING THE DISCUSSION BACK TO OUR MEMBERS DO ANY OF OUR MEMBERS TO ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS WITH REGARD TO S. B. THIRTEEN THIRTY THREE. YEAH YOU KNOW I HAD I HAD A QUESTION THIS IS THE THIRD BILL ON THIS AND YOU KNOW WHEN I GOT THAT. AND NOW IT SAYS THE OTHER DAY. I THOUGHT WELL THERE'S A LOT GOING ON IN SAN DIEGO. BUT WAS THERE ANY DISCUSSION TO CONSOLIDATE THE BILLS OR TO KIND OF. BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE THERE'S A COMPACTED. AND YET PROTRACTED ISSUE GOING ON. IN THIS PARTICULAR REGION BUT WHERE THEIR WORK WAS SO. BECAUSE THAT IS THE GOAL HAVE TO ASK OUR CONSULTANT- ERIC WOULD YOU LIKE TO RESPOND TO THAT WE- WE ANALYZE THREE BILLS ON IN PUBLIC SAFETY ON THE S. AND P. AND THE QUESTION IS WAS THERE A THOUGHT. ABOUT CONSOLIDATING BILLS. AND THAT WAS NOT PROVIDED TO ME BECAUSE MINE TAKES A DIFFERENT TACT OF SPECIFICALLY I KNOW I GET THAT AND I NOTICED THAT EACH OF THE KIND OF HAVE A DIFFERENT. PATH AND YET I FEEL LIKE EVERYONE IS TALKING ABOUT- AND HOW TO ADDRESS THE SAME ISSUE WHICH IS HOW DO YOU. YOU KNOW LEGALLY CONSTITUTIONALLY MANAGE THE PLACEMENT OF S. V. PEAS BACK INTO A COMMUNITY- IN A WAY THAT IS TRANSPARENT IN A WAY THAT IS LAWFUL IN A WAY THAT PROTECTS COMMUNITIES AND IN A WAY THAT IS- PLAN. RECOGNIZING THAT THERE ARE ETHICAL CONSTITUTIONAL AND LEGAL CONCERNS RECOGNIZING THAT THERE ARE FIXES THAT NEED TO BE MADE BUT IT ALSO SEEMS. JUST ARM I WAS JUST CURIOUS BECAUSE OFTEN TIMES. WE DON'T HAVE- THESE KINDS OF BILLS COME BEFORE A PUBLIC SAFETY AND THEN TO HAVE THREE OF THEM FROM AUTHORED BY FOLKS IN THE SAME GENERAL AREA IT JUST STRUCK ME AS IF THERE WAS A WAY TO SORT OF. CONJOIN OR YOU KNOW JUST SORT OF CREATE SOMETHING THAT'S MORE HOLISTIC. OR AT LEAST JUST ADDRESSES IT SO THAT WAS MY OWN MY OWN QUESTION YOU KNOW I APPRECIATE THAT SENATOR CALL LOGGER AND I WOULDN'T DISAGREE I THINK YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT WHAT THE FOCUS OF EACH BILL IS AND I'M A LITTLE ODD. UNINFORMED I DIDN'T I WASN'T ABLE TO WATCH THE DISCUSSION ON NOW SENATOR- PRO TEM'S BILL THIS MORNING BUT HERS AS I UNDERSTAND IT IT ADDS THE DA TWO ONE OF THE INDIVIDUALS THAT CAN BE AT THE TABLE LONGER DISCUSSING PLACEMENT WHAT I'D LIKE TO FOCUS ON WITH MY BILL WE'RE NOT CHANGING THE LAW AS IT CURRENTLY STANDS AND WHERE THEY MIGHT BE PLAY STARS OF FOCUSING ON. OF THE ABILITY TO PLACE AN INDIVIDUAL WHO WAS CONVICTED IN ONE COUNTY AND HAVE SERVED THEIR TIME BOB SUPPOSEDLY ARE NO LONGER A THREAT TO PUBLIC SAFETY YET THEY'RE NOT PLACE BACK IN THAT COUNTY WHICH IS PART OF A CURRENTLY PART OF THE PROCESS SO WHY IS THAT IS BECAUSE QUOTE UNQUOTE THERE'S EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES MY BILL IS ASKING FOR A DISCUSSION OF OUT. NOW I KNOW THE PUBLIC DEFENDERS ARE CONCERNED ABOUT PRIVACY BUT I CONSIDER EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES TO BE SOMETHING ABOUT WHATEVER HAPPENED IN THAT OTHER COUNTY NOT WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW IS THAT INDIVIDUAL WHO MIGHT BE STRUGGLING WITH CONCERNS BY HAVING YOU KNOW IMPROPER THOUGHTS ARE IT IS ABOUT WHETHER THEY WERE- RECOMMITTED FROM THAT OTHER COUNTY THEY CAME IN. CONTACT WITH YOU KNOW THERE'S THEIR PEER GROUP AGAIN WHATEVER THOSE ARE NOT THINGS THAT GO TO THE HEART OF THAT DISCUSSION BETWEEN A PSYCHOTHERAPIST IN THE INDIVIDUAL SO I DO BELIEVE IT'S LEGITIMATE TO PROVIDE TO A COUNTY IN A PRIVACY SETTING THE JUDGE AND THE PROSECUTOR AND THE DEFENSE ATTORNEY ON WHAT WERE THE EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES OTHER DOWN THE BEHAVIORAL MODIFICATION ISSUES WITH THE INDIVIDUAL SO IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THIS PARTICULAR COMPONENT OF MY BILL. SHOULD BE INCLUDED RECEIVING COUNTY BECAUSE WHEN YOU HAVE ONE COUNTY SAN DIEGO THAT CURRENTLY HAS SIXTEEN OF THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN RELEASED PACIFIC LEE IN THEIR COUNTY. THEY HAVE A REASON TO SAY HEY WAIT A MINUTE OUR WHY AREN'T WE HAVING OFF. TO WHY THEY WERE COMMITTED OUT ORANGE COUNTY RIVERSIDE COUNTY SAN MATTEO AND NOW THEY'RE BEING PLACED IN SAN DIEGO WHICH MIGHT BE QUITE A DISTANCE FROM THEIR ORIGINAL DOMICILE. THAT'S THAT'S A SIMPLE QUESTION. THAT COULD BE PROVIDED PRIVACY CLEARLY IN THE DISCUSSION AS THE PERSON IS BEING PLACED NOW WHEN THEY GET TO THAT PARTICULAR HOME. AND THE THINGS THAT HAPPEN IN OUR COMMUNITIES THAT ARE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THAT WELL THOSE ARE. THOSE ARE THE RIGHT OF THE PUBLIC- TO RESIST IN HAVE. THEIR THEIR DAY IN THE IN THE PUBLIC ARENA IT DOESN'T MEAN AUDIT YET TARA IS GRANTED DOWN BUT CERTAINLY A DISCUSSION ABOUT BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T HAVE THIS INFORMATION. VERY DIFFICULT TO SENATOR WIENER. TO TALK TO PEOPLE WITH PITCHFORKS IF YOU PUT THIS PERSON IN MY COMMUNITY. AND HE DID A VERY GOOD DESCRIPTION OF WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM WHEN HE WAS A LOCAL GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL. SO WE NEED THAT INFORMATION WHEN WE ARE THERE. ON THE DÍAS TRYING TO EXPLAIN WHY YOU KNOW. ALL WE WENT THROUGH ALL THE PROCESS FOUND OUT WHY THEY HAD TO COME TO SAN DIEGO OR ORANGE COUNTY INSTEAD OF RIVERSIDE. AND I THINK THOSE ARE THE THINGS THAT PEOPLE NEED TO HEAR AND I DON'T SEE THAT THAT'S A VIOLATION. OF PRIVACY OF THIS PARTICULAR INDIVIDUAL NOT GOING INTO. YOU KNOW THE THAT HE STILL FEELS THAT HE NEEDS TO DO X. Y. NZ THAT SAW CERTAINLY- YOU KNOW CRIME AGAINST SOMEONE ELSE. THOSE ARE MY- HE WITHOUT MY CLOTHES SO I ASKED. FOR YOU TO CONSIDER THAT. AND MAYBE LET THIS ONE GO FORWARD WE CERTAINLY CAN CONTINUE TO WORK. WITH THE OPPOSITION WE DID A LOT OF WORK WE REMOVED ALL OF THE OLD. THE GEOGRAPHICAL RESTRICTIONS WERE TALKING ABOUT TAKING THE TIME LIMITS OUT MAYBE THOSE NEED TO BE THE SAME WITH EXTENDED IT WE DOUBLE THAT ACTUALLY. BUT THOSE ARE THINGS THAT CAN CERTAINLY BE DONE IN A FASTER- SETTING- THAT'S DICTATED BY THE JUDGE IN THE COURTS. ALL WITH PUBLIC DEFENDER PROSECUTOR AND THE JUDGE TALKING ABOUT THIS. BUT TO ME IT IT STARS. IT'S JUST ANOTHER STEP SENATOR PRO TEM'S BILL WAS A GOOD STEP FORWARD INCLUDING THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY. I DO BELIEVE THE EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES IF THEY ARE SITUATIONAL. ARE SHOULD BE DISCUSSED AND I WOULD LIKE. OF THAT PART OF THE BILL- TO BE. HONORED TODAY AND THEN WE ARE CERTAINLY COMMITTED. CLEARLY OUGHT TO DO MORE WORK ON IT. IN MAYBE CONSOLIDATE AS IT GOES FORWARD. WITH THE OTHER BILL. BUT IF IT DOEN'T STAND. TODAY WE DON'T HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO THAT. IT IS THERE A I NOTICED DOES RIGHTS. HAD A LETTER AND THEY'RE LISTED AND SO CAN YOU SPEAK TO WHY THEY ARE IN SUPPORT IS THERE AN IMPACT ON FOLKS WITH- DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES OR PHYSICAL DISABILITIES. ARMS FOR WELL I THINK BECAUSE WE ORIGINALLY HAD A CONGREGATE CARE FOR. THE ON THOSE OF. GILTS INCOME. FOR WHICH WE DID REMOVE FILES THE SENATE TO THE REQUEST FOR THAT. WHAT ALL OF THE BILL HURT THREE WE HAVE A MOTION FROM SENATOR JOE BURKE APOLOGIES THAT I WASN'T ABLE TO HEAR THE- HAD TO PRESENT IN ANOTHER COMMITTEE SO I DIDN'T NECESSARILY HERE- EITHER THE VARIOUS TESTIMONY OF THE DIFFERENT DIALOGUE BUT- I- FROM MY FOR ME THIS HAS A NUMBER OF PROBLEMATIC- A PROVISIONS AND SINCE THERE WERE NOT- AND THEN THE- THIRD SEEDED. IN ADVANCE. WITH THE COMMITTEE I'M NOT COMFORTABLE SUPPORTING THE BILL IN ITS CURRENT FORM AND- YOU KNOW I'VE ONLY LEARNED THAT I WOULD BE CHAIRING THE COMMITTEE HEARD VERY RECENTLY SO IT'S NOT LIKE I WAS IN A POSITION TO BE ABLE TO INITIATE A SUCH ON NEGOTIATIONS SO. ON I WILL NOT BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY- WE DO HAVE A MOTION AND- YOU MAY CLOSE CENTER BATES MAJORITY APOLOGIES. WELL I KIND OF WENT OVER MY CLOTHES ARE THAT AB WHAT I WOULD ASK IS IF YOU WOULDN'T TAKE A VOTE TODAY I HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY LITTLE MORE DISCUSSION ON WHAT SENATOR COM LONGER HAS. DISCUSSED AND MAYBE WE CAN HAVE. A RESOLUTION IN ONE BILL BUT IN PARTICULAR TO ADDRESS I THINK THIS EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES CERTAINLY GOES A LONG WAY AND IN RELIEVING A COUNTY IS CONCERNED WHICH IS WHY. THIS BILL AND THE OTHER TWO ARE ARE BEFORE YOU FROM THE COUNTY OF SAN DIEGO I THINK THERE'S A CRY HUE AND CRY THERE THAT SHOULD AT LEAST BE RECOGNIZE AND SEE IF WE CAN WORK THROUGH IT- APPRECIATE. THAT CLOSE AND OBVIOUSLY WE DID- ACT ON ONE BILL IN THIS REGARD THAT- FROM A SAN DIEGO REPRESENTATIVE- THAT- APPEARS. TO BE IN GOOD SHAPE FOR PASSAGE FIVE- BUT WHAT I THINK IS THE APPROPRIATE THING TO DO IS TO VOTE ON THE BILL NOW OUR CHAIR BUT THEN WE COULD YOU COULD REQUEST RECONSIDERATION WICKED GRANT RECONSIDERATION SUCH DISCUSSIONS COULD BE INITIATED WITH THE CHAIR. ALL RIGHT WITH THAT- LET'S- THE MOTION WOULD BE DO PASSAGE AS AMENDED BUT FIRST AMEND AND- I GUESS THOSE ARE THE MOMENTS THAT YOU HAD AGREED TO TAKE. YEAH RIGHT RIGHT AND- AS ODD TO APPROACH SO- WITHOUT WILL HAVE A ROLL CALL SB THIRTEEN THIRTY THREE DO PASS AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS SKINNER. NOT VOTING SKINNER NOT VOTING- PHOTOBOOK I TROUBLE GUY COM AUGER. KAMLAGER NOT VOTING. RIGHT WE'LL LEAVE IT ON CALL FOR A THE COMMITTEE MEMBER BUT IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO REQUEST NOW RECONSIDERING RECONSIDERATION. YEAH AFTER THAT. ALL RIGHT. SO WE WILL NOW MOVE TO- REVENUE A SECOND WOULD BE NINE TWENTY FIVE CORRECT. WELL I'D LIKE TO SAY THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT SB NINE TWENTY FIVE- WHICH IS ANA. WHICH WILL HELP LAW ENFORCEMENT UNDERSTAND AND QUANTIFY THE CAUSES BEHIND FATAL COLLISIONS ON AVERAGECALIFORNIA EXPERIENCES NEARLY THREE THOUSAND DEATHS ANNUALLY DUE TO CAR ACCIDENTS UNFORTUNATELY MANY OF THE DRIVERS INVOLVED IN THESE ACCIDENTS ARE DRIVING IMPAIRED. DUE TO ALCOHOL AND OR DRUG CONSUMPTION FOR INSTANCE IN DRIVERS IN ORANGE COUNTY HAD AT LEAST ONE SUBSTANCE DRUGS AND- AND OR ALCOHOL IN THEIR SYSTEM. CURRENTLY LOCAL CORONERS AND MEDICAL EXAMINERS ARE REQUIRED TO TEST DECEASED DRIVERS AND PASSENGERS FOR ALCOHOL CONTENT BUT NOT FOR DRUG CONTENT WITH THE LEGALIZATION OF RECREATIONAL MARIJUANA THEN THE RISE OF OPIOID ABUSE MANY NEW DRIVING UNDER THE INFLUENCE CASES ARE DUE TO DRUG USE NOT JUST ALCOHOL. FOR INSTANCE FROM AUGUST FIRST TWENTY TWENTY TWO JULY THIRTY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY ONE IMPAIRING DRUGS WERE DETECTED IN 41% OF SAMPLES ANALYZED WITH THE ORANGE COUNTY CRIME LAB WHERE THE BLOOD ALCOHOL CONTENT WAS. POINT 008% OR GREATER SOME LOCAL GOVERNMENTS LIKE ORANGE AND SAN FRANCISCO COUNTIES HAVE VOLUNTARILY BEGUN TESTING FOR DRUG CONTENT AFTER A FATAL COLLISIONS HOWEVER MANY OF THESE CASES ARE GOING UNDETECTED STATEWIDE BECAUSE THERE IS NO REQUIREMENT TO TEST FOR A DRIVER'S OF DRUG CONTENT AFTER A FATAL COLLISION. WE HAVE THE LEGISLATURE NEED ACCURATE DATA ON THE CAUSES OF FATAL COLLISIONS ACROSS THE STATE SO WE CAN MAKE SOUND EVIDENCE BASED POLICIES SB NINE TWENTY FIVE WILL UPDATE CURRENT LAW TO REQUIRE DRUG TESTING AFTER FATAL COLLISIONS. IN ADDITION TO ALCOHOL TESTING REFLECTING ACCURATELY THE MODERN USE OF PRESCRIPTION AND RECREATIONAL DRUGS ADDITIONALLY THIS BILL WILL REQUIRE TESTING IN CASES OF DEATHS THAT OCCUR WITHIN FORTY EIGHT HOURS OF THE COLLISION INSTEAD OF JUST TWENTY FOUR HOURS. CAPTURING SIGNIFICANTLY MORE DATA ON FATAL COLLISIONS THE BILL IS THE REINTRODUCTION OF SB TWO EIGHTY THREE FROM TWENTY NINETEEN WHICH DID PASSED UNANIMOUSLY OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE AND ON. TO THE SENATE FLOOR THE BILL WAS LATER HELD IN ASSEMBLY PUBLIC SAFETY DUE TO CONCERNS FROM THE OPPOSITION. BUT THOSE CONCERNS HAVE BEEN ADDRESSED AND THAT OPPOSITION HAS MOVED RECOMMENDATION IN THIS BILL ARE DIRECTLY REFERENCED IN THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE. FROM THE CALIFORNIA IMPAIRED DRIVING TASK FORCE COMMISSION FROM THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN SB NINETY FOR A DOCUMENT THAT WAS DERIVED FROM DIVERSE COLLABORATION. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT TO GIVE OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT EVERY TOOL POSSIBLE TO UNDERSTAND AND PREVENT FUTURE FATAL COLLISIONS. BY WITNESS WILL BE ORANGE COUNTY SHERIFF DON BARNES AND I ALSO HAVE JENNIFER HARMAN THE CRIME LABORATORY DIRECTOR AT THE SAN DIEGO COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT REGIONAL CRIME LABORATORY. AVAILABLE TO HELP ANSWER ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS. THANK YOU LET'S START WITH OUR- LEAD WITNESS THEN- I'M NOT SURE IF THEY'RE BOTH ON THE PHONE OR IN THE ROOM. I THNK THEY'RE ON THE PHONE SO MODERATOR GO AHEAD. THANK YOU TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION SB NINE TO FIVE PLEASE PRESS ONE AND ZERO AT THIS TIME. IT'S NOT OPPOSITION NOIT IS SUPPORT AND IT IS THE LEAD WITNESS SUPPORT FOR NINE TO FIVE. THANK YOU. THIS IS A SURE FARMS HERE ME YES WE CAN'T. THANK YOU CHAIR SKINNER AND MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF SB NINE TWENTY FIVE AND ALSO WANT TO THANK CENTER PAGE FOR OFFERING THIS. LEGISLATION ONCE AGAIN. EACH YEAR THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS DIED AS THE RESULT OF AUTOMOBILE COLLISIONS. UNFORTUNATELY MANY OF THE DRIVERS INVOLVED IN EXPLOSIONS ARE DRIVING IMPAIRED ALCOHOL AND OR DRUG CONSUMPTION. IN TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE IS REFERENCED BY SENATOR BATES FIFTY FOUR POINT 5% OF FATAL. INJURED FATALLY INJURED DRIVERS IN ORANGE COUNTY AT LEAST ONE SUBSTANCE DRUGS AND OR ALCOHOL IN THEIR SYSTEM SURPRISINGLY IT'S REFERENCED FOUR IN TEN. OF INDIVIDUALS WITH WITH A BLOOD ALCOHOL ALCOHOL CONCENTRATION OF POINT 008% THAT THE PER SE LIMIT WHERE YOU CANNOT SAFELY OPERATE A MOTOR VEHICLE. HAD IN ADDITION TO THAT ALCOHOL CONCENTRATION ANOTHER SUBSTANCE SUCH AS MARIJUANA AND OR DRUGS. AS MENTIONED LOCAL GOVERNMENTS LIKE ORANGE COUNTY AND SAN FRANCISCO VOLUNTARILY BEGUN TESTING PER DRUG CONTENT AFTER FATAL COLLISIONS. HOWEVER MANY OF THESE CASES ARE GOING UNDETECTED STATEWIDE BECAUSE THERE'S NO REQUIREMENT TO TEST FOR DRIVERS DRUG CONTENT AFTER A FATAL COLLISION AND WITH THIS BECOMES PROBLEMATIC FOR US- TRYING TO LEAD. IN GOOD LEGISLATION TO IDENTIFY PROBLEMS AND BRING ABOUT SOLUTIONS IS IN PREVIOUS FORMS OF THIS LEGISLATION- ORANGE COUNTY WAS SEEN AS AN OUT LIAR STATEWIDE COMPARED TO OTHER COUNTIES. WHERE IN FACT WE WERE TESTING FOR EVERY SUBSTANCE AND WAS GETTING MORE ACCURATE DATA BRING IT BACK TO- THE- LEGISLATURE FOR CONSIDERATION IN THE FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES WE HAVE THERE'S DIFFERENT WAYS COUNTING REPORTING THE DATA ACCURATE DATA ON THE CAUSE OF THE FATAL COLLISIONS ACROSS THE STATE WITHOUT THAT INFORMATION LEGISLATURE CANNOT IMPLEMENT SOUND EVIDENCE BASED POLICIES TO DROP THE PRIMARY CAUSES OF THESE COLLISIONS. THIS PROBLEM WAS RECENTLY HIGHLIGHTED IN A MARCH TWENTY TWENTY TWO REPORT BY THE NATIONAL HIGHWAY TRAFFIC AND SAFETY ADMINISTRATION KNOWN BY THE ACRONYM AND THAT'S ON. THE REPORT NOTES FIFTY QUOTE CALIFORNIA'S FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES MAKE THEIR OWN DECISIONS ABOUT DRUG TESTING WITH PENALTIES IN DRUG PANELS DIFFERENT ACROSS EACH COUNTY END QUOTE. MISTER HIGHLIGHTED A VERSION OF THIS LEGISLATION AS QUOTE AN EXAMPLE OF HOW THE STATE CAN DEFINE ITS NEED AND SEEK IMPROVEMENTS AND QUOTE. IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE CALIFORNIA'S IMPAIRED DRIVING TASK FORCE INCLUDED RECOMMENDATIONS IN ITS REPORT. TO THE LEGISLATURE WHICH NO CONCORDANCE OF ALL LABORATORIES TESTING FOR ALL SUBSTANCES. IN THEIR TESTING PROCEDURES SB NINE TWENTY FIVE WILL PUT THIS BEST PRACTICE IN PLACE BY UPDATING CURRENT LAW TO REQUIRE DRUG TESTING IN ADDITION TO ALCOHOL TESTING AFTER FATAL COLLISIONS. THE CALIFORNIA JOBS TO LEGISLATIVE LEGALIZATION. OF RECREATIONAL MARIJUANA GRAPPLES WITH THE OPIOID EPIDEMIC THIS THE LEGISLATURE MUST GIVE LAW ENFORCEMENT. AND IN PROTECTION OF THE PUBLIC EVERY TOOL POSSIBLE TO UNDERSTAND AND PREVENT FUTURE FATAL COLLISIONS ENFORCEMENT FORENSIC SCIENTISTS AND ALL WILL BE ABLE TO ASSOCIATIONS IN SUPPORT OF SB NINE TWENTY FIVE.

I DIDN'T- NOT TO GET INTO ALL THE NUANCES OF THE TAX POLICY BUT THE IMPLICATIONS OF. REPEALING THE INTERGENERATIONALTRANSFER ELEMENTS OF PROPOSITION NINETEEN WILL NOT ONLY HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE FIRE FUNDS AS ITS STRUCTURED IN THIS MEASURE BUT ALSO HAVE AN IMPACT ON LOCAL GOVERNMENT REVENUES. IN A IN A SENSE. THE FIRE FUND WILL BE FUNDED BECAUSE THERE WILL BE INCREASES IN LOCAL PROPERTY TAX REVENUES THAT ARE IMPORTANT FOR A SUITE OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT SERVICES INCLUDING- LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENTS AND THE SAVINGS. RELATED TO PROP NINETY EIGHT THAT ARE GENERATED LOCALLY IS WHAT WILL HELP SUPPORT THE FIRE FUND SO THERE ARE SOME. TECHNICAL IMPLICATIONS OF. TRYING TO WORK THROUGH STRUCTURING- PROPOSAL TO. BACKFILL THE LOSSES AND THE LOCAL REVENUES. THE WELL OUR MEMBERS- HAVE A SEPARATE COLLOQUY- APPRECIATE THAT FEEDBACK- THERE'S NO MOTION ON THAT BY THE WAY SO IN MAY- BUT BUT I AM. LOOKING CENTER LAYERED PERHAPS FOR SOME. I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN OFFER IMPROVEMENT BECAUSE I THINK THE DIFFICULTY OF THIS IS ALL THE CONFLICTING THINGS THE LINK. TO THE BALLOT MEASURE AND THE LOSS OF FUNDS DELAYED OPPOSITION AND I ALWAYS WANT TO RESPECT THE SENATOR DEBT IS TRYING TO WORK THINGS OUT AND GET THANK SENATOR PORTANTINO EUROPE. AT A CERTAIN MEMBERS FOR YOUR PATIENCE I REALLY APPRECIATE IT- TODAY I'M PRESENTING. S. B. EIGHT TWENTY NINE WHICH WOULD ESTABLISH MUCH NEEDED SAFETY PROTOCOLS FOR THE USE OF FIREARMS ON PRODUCTION SETS AS I'M SURE YOU'RE ALL AWARE IN OCTOBER OF LAST YEAR IN NEW YORK NEW MEXICO CINEMATOGRAPHER WAS TRAGICALLY FATALLY SHOT AND A DOCTOR WAS BADLY INJURED ON THE SET OF A FILM. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THIS TRAGEDY COULD HAVE A COULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED IF SAFETY PROTOCOLS WERE STANDARDIZED AND PRESCRIBED INTO CALIFORNIA HAS SOME OF THE STRONGEST LAWS BUT WE CAN STILL IMPROVE WHAT'S GOING ON HERE IN WHICH I'M TRYING TO DO TODAY MOTION PICTURE AND TELEVISION PRODUCTION IS A LARGE AND VITAL COMPONENT OF THE CALIFORNIA ECONOMY. AS OUR- CHAIR KNOWS- THROUGH THE BUDGET WE'VE DONE A LOT OF GOOD WORK TO PRESERVE AND PROTECT OUR ENTERTAINMENT- PRODUCTION THROUGHOUT THE STATE- WE ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE STATE'S SETS ARE SAFE AND CURRENTLY PRODUCERS AND OUR LABOR- FRIENDS ARE TRYING TO ADDRESS A PRODUCTION ON SUCH THROUGH THE INDUSTRY WIDE LABOR MANAGEMENT SAFETY COMMITTEE WHICH ESTABLISHES A VOLUNTARY SAFETY BULLETINS TO PROVIDE SAFETY COURSES FOR WORKERS HOWEVER THESE OPERATE AS BEST PRACTICE GUIDES AS OPPOSED TO ESTABLISH SAFETY PROTOCOLS. GIVEN THE IMMENSITY OF THE FILM INDUSTRY YOU'RE IN CALIFORNIA LEGISLATION THAT'S OFFICE SOLIDIFIES THESE VOLUNTARY STANDARDS PERTAINING TO FIREARMS IS NEEDED SB EIGHT TWENTY NINE REQUIRE THAT THOSE WHO HANDLE FIREARMS ARE PROPERLY TRAINED THIS BILL WILL MAKE CALIFORNIA PRODUCTION SAID SAFER AND HELP ENSURE THAT ANOTHER TRAGIC INCIDENT DOES NOT OCCUR TODAY I HAVE WITH ME FELIPE A FIVE DAYS FROM THE MOTION PICTURE ASSOCIATION AND ACT APPROPRIATELY WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU CENTER PORTANTINO AND LEAD WITNESS MISTER FORTIES YOU CAN BEGIN. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR- MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS PHILIP IF WENT THIS AND I AM REPRESENTING THE MOTION PICTURE ASSOCIATION. IN SUPPORT OF SENATE BILL EIGHT TO NINE THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY. MPAS A TRADE ASSOCIATION FOR THE LEADING PRODUCERS AND DISTRIBUTORS OF MOTION PICTURES TELEVISION AND STREAMING SERIES ACROSS ALL EXHIBITION PLATFORMS. FOR MOVIE THEATERS TO BROADCAST AND CABLE TELEVISION TO THE INTERNET AND STREAMING SERVICES. IT'S MEMBERS ARE DISNEY NBC UNIVERSAL NETFLIX PARAMOUNT SONY PICTURES AND WARNER BROTHERS. MPA SUPPORTS SENATOR PORTANTINO'S BILL TO ENHANCE FIREARM SAFETY IN MOTION PICTURE PRODUCTION. EACH STUDIO HAS THE DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENT HEALTH AND SAFETY DEDICATED TO ENSURING THE WORKPLACE SAFETY FOR THEIR EMPLOYEES. AND ALL THE STUDIOS PARTICIPATE IN THE INDUSTRY WIDE A LABOR MANAGEMENT SAFETY COMMITTEE. WITH THEIR UNION AND GIL PARKER'S THIS COMMITTEE WAS CREATED THROUGH THE PROCESS OF COLLECTIVE BARGAINING BETWEEN THE PRODUCERS AND THE UNIONS AND GUILDS. UNDER THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT THE COMMITTEE'S REQUIRE TO MEET MONTHLY TO ADDRESS A VARIETY OF SAFETY ISSUES. TOGETHER THE STUDIO AND UNION REPRESENTATIVES HAVE DEVELOPED OVER FORTY SAFETY BULLETINS WHICH ARE DESIGNED TO BE BEST PRACTICE GUIDES. FOR VARIOUS ELEMENTS OF PRODUCTION THE SAFETY COMMITTEE HAS SAFETY BULLETINS THAT ADDRESS THE USE OF FIREARMS AND PRODUCTIONS AND THOSE BULLETINS ARE FOLLOWED BY MPA'S MEMBER COMPANIES PRODUCTIONS. END THE SAFETY COMMITTEE HAS A SAFETY CLASS ATTENDED BY THE ARMORS TO HANDLE FIREARMS THAT PROVIDES TRAINING FOR ALL THE SAFE HANDLING OF FIREARMS. CURRENTLY CALIFORNIA LAW DOES NOT REQUIRE SAFETY TRAINING FOR THOSE WHO SEEK TO OVERSEE THE USE OF FIREARMS AND PRODUCTION MPA'S MEMBER SEEK TO ENSURE THAT ON ALL PRODUCTIONS THOSE WHO MANAGE THE USE OF FIREARMS ARE PRODUCTIONS. THOSE WHO WERE CLOSE TO THE FIRE ARMS IN THOSE FIRE THOSE PERFORMERS TO UTILIZE THE FIREARMS HAVE APPROPRIATE SAFETY TRAINING AND THAT'S WHAT SENATE BILL EIGHT TO NINE DOES THE BILL REQUIRES PROPER SAFETY TRAINING. FOR THE ARMORS OTHER CREW AND THE PERFORMERS WHO USE FIREARMS THE BILL REQUIRES FARMERS TO COMPLETE A SAFETY COURSE. DEVELOPED BY THE SAFETY COMMITTEE IN CONSULTATION WITH THE STATE FIRE MARSHAL THE STATE FIRE MARSHAL WOULD APPROVE VENDORS TO OFFER THE CLASS. THE SAFETY CLASS WILL OFFER HANDS ON TRAINING AND DETAILED SAFETY PRODUCTION PROCEDURES AS SPECIFIED IN THE BILL IN ADDITION SENATE BILL EIGHTY NINE REQUIRES THOSE CREW MEMBERS WHO WORK NEARBY TO THE FIREARMS. AS WELL AS THOSE PERFORMERS USING A GUN AS PART OF THE PERFORMANCE THIS TAKE A SAFETY CLASS END OF THE BILL PROVIDES THAT WHEN FIRE ARMS A USE. THE PRODUCER MUST HIRE A LOCAL FIRE OFFICIAL TO SUPERVISE THE HANDLING OF FIREARMS FINALLY THE BILL PROHIBITS THE USE OF AMMUNITION EXCEPT IN MOST LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES. SB EIGHT TO NINE WILL ELEVATE AND ENHANCE FIREARM SAFETY AND PRODUCTION AND MPA IS PLEASED TO SUPPORT THE BILL MPA LOOKS FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH THE SENATOR ON THIS. IMPORTANT BILL AND WE WANT TO THANK HIM FOR HIS LEADERSHIP ON THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE.

RECORD. ALONE RESULTING IN ONE POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS IN ECONOMIC COSTS. A LOT TO NEARLY FIFTEEN THOUSAND JOBS ACROSS THE-AGRICULTURAL SECTOR. AND THE AVERAGE ANNUAL TEMPERATURES HAVE INCREASED ALREADY INCREASED TO CALIFORNIA EXCEEDING TWO DEGREES. ACCORDING TO HE CRISIS MADAM CHAIR. CALIFORNIA IS IN THE MIDDLE OF A STATE WIDE MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS NEARLY ONE IN SIX CALIFORNIA DOES HAS A MENTAL HEALTH NEED AND ONE IN TWENTY SUFFERS FROM A SERIOUS MENTAL MENTAL ILLNESS THAT MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO CARRY OUT MAJOR LIFE ACTIVITIES THESE MEMBERS ARE EVEN MORE THESE NUMBERS ARE EVEN MORE SEVERE WHEN WE LOOK AT THE STATE'S HOMELESS POPULATIONS WITH 70% STRUGGLING WITH MENTAL ILLNESS SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER AND OR PHYSICAL DISABILITY. IN ADDITION GROWING NUMBERS OF INMATES ARE WAITING FOR STATE HOSPITAL BEDS SOMETIMES FOR MONTHS AT A TIME IN THE PAST FIVE YEARS THE NUMBER OF CALIFORNIA INMATES DEEMED INCOMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL AND ORDERED AND ORDERED SENT TO STATE HOSPITALS INCREASED 60% A FEW DECADES AGO FEWER THAN HALF OF STATE HOSPITAL PATIENTS CAME FROM THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM TODAY MORE THAN NINETY PERCENT. DO WHEN PEOPLE IN PSYCHIATRIC CRISIS LINE EMERGENCY ROOMS AND JAILS IT'S FREQUENTLY BECAUSE THEY CAN'T GET TREATMENT IN THE COMMUNITY. EVEN WHEN THEY ASK FOR IT. MANY CALIFORNIA CAT MANY CALIFORNIA COUNTIES HAVE BEGUN TURNING TO MENTAL HEALTH AND HOMELESS COURTS AS A MEANS OF ADDRESSING THE ROOT CAUSE OF THESE ISSUES THESE PROGRAMS ALLOW FOR THE INDIVIDUAL WITH MENTAL ILLNESS AND HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS TO GET THE RESOURCES THAT THEY NEED IN ORDER TO TURN THEIR LIVES AROUND THESE COURTS ALSO WORK TO EASE PRISON AND JAIL CROWDING BY GETTING PEOPLE INTO TREATMENT INSTEAD OF CUSTODY THUS REDUCING THE CHANCES OF RECIDIVISM DUE TO UNTREATED MENTAL. MENTAL ILLNESS COLLABORATIVE COURTS TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF AN IMPROVING OUTCOMES FOR SPECIALIZED POPULATIONS OF CRIMINAL OFFENDERS. THIS INCLUDES FORTY FOUR COUNTIES WITH MENTAL HEALTH COURTS FOR ADULT OFFENDERS AND THIRTEEN COUNTIES WITH HOMELESS WORKS. NUMEROUS REVIEWS AND EVALUATIONS HAVE FOUND THAT MENTAL HEALTH COURTS REDUCE INCARCERATION AND RE OFFENSE WHILE IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF LIFE AMONG THOSE DIAGNOSED WITH MENTAL ILLNESSES. IN FACT A TWO THOUSAND AND SEVENTEEN STUDY OF THE SACRAMENTO COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH COURT FOUND THAT ROUGHLY THE COURT AND HAD A LOWER RATE OF REARREST THAN NON GRADUATES. IN ADDITION THEY HAD A 75% LOWER CHANCE OF BEING HOUSE HOSPITALIZED AND A DECREASE IN REAR FENCE ACROSS GENDERS ETHNO RACIAL BACKGROUNDS AND AGES. HOWEVER DESPITE THESE COURTS BEING PROVEN AS SUCCESSFUL TOOL FOR HELPING HER MENTALLY ILL POPULATIONS WHO BECOME. JUSTICE INVOLVED THESE ARE COURT THESE COURTS ARE OFTEN UNDERFUNDED AND HAVING SUFFICIENT PROGRAMMING OPTIONS FOR PARTICIPATING DEFENDANTS. THAT IS WHY I HAVE DECIDED TO INTRODUCE SB FOURTEEN TWENTY SEVEN IN ORDER TO GET INDIVIDUALS WITH MENTAL ILLNESS AND HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS THE CARE THEY NEED AND TO PROMOTE REHABILITATION AND HOUSING STABILITY. SB FOURTEEN TWENTY SEVEN ESTABLISHES TO GRANT PROGRAMS WON A GRANT PROGRAM TO HELP COUNTIES TO ESTABLISH OR EXPAND COLLABORATIVE MENTAL HEALTH IN HOMELESS QUARTZ INTO A GRANT PROGRAM FOR COUNTIES TO INSTITUTE REENTRY SERVICES FOR JAIL INMATES AT RISK OF BECOMING HOMELESS UPON RELEASE. I WILL ALSO NOTE THAT THESE THIS PAST WEEK WE HAVE HAD THE PRODUCTIVE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL ABOUT WAYS IN WHICH TO IMPROVE THE BILL. AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO IMPLEMENTING SOME OF THESE AS WE MOVE FORWARD. JOINING ME TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT HIS SAN MARINO COUNTY SHERIFF SHANNON'S I GUESS- FOUR AND IF HE'S NOT AVAILABLE WE ALSO HAVE SERGEANTS JULIUS MY CHRISTIAN SEVERINO COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT LEGISLATIVE LIAISON AND ALSO JOINING ON THE LINE.

BUT I BELIEVE MORE MUST BE DONE TO SECURE OUR FUTURE IN CALIFORNIA WE BELIEVE THAT WATER IN CALIFORNIA. CENTER CORTESE AND I'VE- MUST BE MODERNIZED. ANY WEIGHT THAT WE I JUST SPOKE TO IN THAT CONTEXT. AND I WANT TO GIVE YOU ANOTHER EXAMPLE WE TOOK OUT THE CONCERN OF CYBER ATTACKS ON OUR WATER AND FOOD SECTORS TO THE ALLEY GOES OFFICE LAST YEAR. AND THE RESEARCH THAT BE FOUND- BE CONCLUDED THAT IT THERE WAS A LACK OF DEDICATED CYBERSECURITY FUNDING AND STAFF LIMITS A PREPARED IT'S OF CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTOR ENTITIES.

DID YOU SAY YOU WERE LOOKING FOR SHARING DAY NO NO SHARE SHERIFF SHERIFF RIGHT NOW OKAY WHETHER PROCEED. YOUR LINE IS OPEN. EIGHT THANK YOU MEMBERS I APOLOGIZE FOR THE TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES BUT AS YOU'RE AWARE- BILL FOURTEEN TWENTY SEVEN ESTABLISHES GRANT PROGRAMS THAT PROVIDE COLLABORATIVE EFFORT EVERY USING HOMELESSNESS AMONG INMATES RELEASED FROM CUSTODY AND ADDRESSES CRIME REDUCTION OF THE MENTALLY ILL. AT A LARGE SCALE AND HAM RADIO COUNTY THIS HAS BEEN OUR DAILY MENTAL HEALTH POPULATION OF FIFTEEN POINT FOUR PERCENT. WHICH IS COMPARATIVE TO TWENTY SIX HUNDRED INMATES FEMENINO COUNTY TRACKS THE TOP ONE HUNDRED FREQUENTLY ARRESTED INDIVIDUALS. AND TWENTY TWENTY OF THE TOP THREE CHARGES OF THESE REAR FENDERS WERE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF A CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE PUBLIC INTOXICATION AND TRESPASSING. FORTY SEVEN OF THOSE ONE HUNDRED DO NOT HAVE AN ADDRESS. THAT THE WHOLE MENTAL HEALTH COURTS ARE A TYPE OF COLLABORATIVE COURT. ALTERNATIVE TO THE TRADITIONAL COURT SYSTEM AND PROVIDE SPECIFIC SERVICES OF TREATMENT TO DEFENDANTS WHO ARE DEALING WITH MENTAL ILLNESS. ALTHOUGH EACH MNTAL HEALTH COURT HAS DIFFERENT REQUIREMENTS AND SERVICES AVAILABLE TO PARTICIPANTS THEY SHARE THE SAME GOALS OF SUPPORTING PARTICIPANTS. AND THEIR SUCCESSFUL RETURN TO SOCIETY. REDUCING THE IN FOR SAFETY AND THE OF THE- ALMOST CHORDS VERY SPECIAL SESSION HELD IN A LOCAL SHELTER OTHER COMMUNITY SITE. FOR ALMOST AND RESOLVE OUTSTANDING MISDEMEANOR CRIMINAL. INCLUDING MANY OF QUALITY OF LIFE INFRACTION SUCH AS DISORDERLY CONDUCT PUBLIC DRUNKENNESS. SPEAKING ON THE SIDEWALK. THE HOMELESS COURT PROGRAM. RECOGNIZE MUCH PART VOLUNTARY EFFORTS TO IMPROVE LIVES AND MOVED FROM THE STREETS TOWARDS SELF SUFFICIENCY INCLUDING PARTICIPATION IN COMMUNITY BASED TREATMENT SERVICES. PROVIDING COMMUNITY OUTREACH AND ASSISTANCE TO HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS WITH OUTSTANDING COURT CASES IS A PRIMARY FOCUS BECAUSE THESE TYPES OF CASES TEND TO ESCALATE WHEN HOMELESS DEFENDANTS FAILED TO APPEAR IN COURT. MANY COUNTY HAVE COLLABORATIVE COURTS TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF SPECIALIZED POPULATIONS OF CRIMINAL OFFENDERS HOWEVER THESE COURTS ARE OFTEN UNDERFUNDED.

IN GENERAL I SUPPORT THE CONCEPT OF THE BILL AND WHAT THE- WHAT IS TRYING TO BE ACCOMPLISHED HERE HOWEVER WHAT I AM- IT WE HAVE. REENTRY PROGRAMS THAT ARE DIVERSIONARY COURTS ARE USE AND SOME OF THEM ARE RUN BY- FIVE DIFFERENT ENTITIES AND OF COURSE THE COURT IS- CHOOSES WHAT ENTITIES AND THE COURT HAS CONFIDENCE IN THE ENTITIES THEY'RE CHOOSING AND BUT THIS BILL HAS THE SPECIFICATION THAT IT MUST BE THE SHERIFF'S OFFICE THAT OPERATES THE PROGRAM SO IN OTHER WORDS IT'S THE SHERIFF'S OFFICE THAT RECEIVES THE GRANT VERSES FIVE. OR SOLELY VERSES ALLOWING FOR- POTENTIALLY OTHER ENTITIES FOR RECEIVING THE GRANT TO RUN THE PROGRAM SO I'M WONDERING WHY THAT THE STIPULATION THAT IT MUST BE THE SHERIFF'S OFFICE ONLY- MAY I ASK YOU THERE'S- SHIRT I GUESS FOR OUR TECHNICAL. EXPERTS TO SPEAK ON THAT FRANCINE BURN. TO BE OKAY. FIVE SHIRT ON IS IT THE TECHNICAL WITNESS THAT ASKED FOR IT THE SPECIFICATION OR IS THIS YEAR'S OFFICE.

SURE SENATOR. IN IN CONVERSATION WITH- CENTER UNTIL LOW IN FAMILY YOU KNOW COUNTY THESE TYPES OF COURTS THAT YOU DESCRIBED ARE NOT AVAILABLE SINCE THE INCEPTION OF THESE PEOPLE ARE WITH THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT IN TERMS OF TAKING THEM INTO CUSTODY WE SIMPLY WANTED TO COORDINATE BUILDING THE CAPACITY IN THIS COUNTY TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS THE CONCERNS OF HOMELESSNESS AND MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES AND- IN THIS COUNTY I PROBABLY HAVE THE MOST ONGOING KNOWLEDGE OF HOW WE CAN MAKE THIS WORK AND IT'S MORE ABOUT COORDINATORS EFFORT AND A COORDINATORS OFFER. TO BRING THIS TYPE OF SERVICE ARE COUNTY AND USE MORE OF THE CONSERVATORSHIP MODEL WHICH IS IN LINE WITH THE CARE COURT MODEL THAT THE GOVERNOR. IS CURRENTLY PROPOSING. EVEN YES BUT I THINK EVEN IN THE CARE COURT MODEL. THE FUNDING WOULD NOT ONLY GO THROUGH FOR EXAMPLE THE SHERIFF'S OFFICE BUT- WHAT I GUESS WHAT I WANT TO KNOW IS WHETHER YOU'D BE OPEN AND- APOLOGIES FOR NOT REALIZING THAT SAMBAR DDD DO YOU KNOW COUNTY DOES NOT YET HAVE THESE TYPE OF DIVERSITY COURTS- BUT I THINK I REALLY APPLAUD YOU FOR YOUR RECOGNITION OF THE VALUE OF THEM. AND BUT I WONDER IF YOU'D BE OPEN TO HAVING THE GRANTS GO ALSO BE AVAILABLE TO. ENTITIES THAT THE COURT. ON THAT THE COURT ITSELF ALSO DEEMS AS A CAPABLE OF PROVIDING THE SERVICE THAT YOU ARE JUST TRYING TO CHIEF. HELLO I WOULD BE INTERESTED THAT I AM DOING MY BEST TO BE IN PARTNERSHIP WITH ALL OF THE LAW AND JUSTICE SYSTEM AS A WHOLE PARTICULARLY HERE IN OUR COUNTY. JUST SO THAT WE BUILD CAPACITY TO BETTER SERVE THIS POPULATION. GREAT- YES I THINK THAT THAT MIGHT HELP ACHIEVE YOUR OBJECTIVE BECAUSE THERE MAY BE- GIVEN WHAT YOU ARE TRYING TO- IS THERE. WE DON'T KNOW YET YOU CITED SOME VERY SIGNIFICANT NUMBERS AND- YOU KNOW IF THIS IS SUCCESSFUL THERE MAY BE- THERE MAY BE NEED FOR- BE EITHER ADDITIONAL PROGRAMS OR TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THIS KIND OF SERVICE IN ORDER FOR YOUR DIVERSION PROGRAM TO BE SUCCESSFUL.

ON BUT WE CAN HAVE PUBLIC SAFETY IN YOUR STAFF WORK OUT WHAT THE LANGUAGE IS SO YOU'RE COMFORTABLE IN OKAY IT WORKS ABSOLUTELY OKAY DEFINITELY LOOK FORWARD TO HAVING MORE CONVERSATIONS IN THIS IS AS I SAID EARLIER THIS ISN'T A NEW SPACE FOR ME SO I AM VERY AN OPENING HERE OKAY- EXCELLENT LET ME SEE IF THERE'S- IF MY OTHER COMMITTEE MEMBER HAS ANY QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS. OKAY- A- DO WE HAVE A MOTION ON THE BILL OF. ALL RIGHT SO WE HAVE A MOTION. AND WITH THE AGAIN WITH THE- AGREEMENT THAT- SENATOR OCHO VOTERS JUST MADE. REGARDING- AMENDING. AND- SENATOR TROUBLES ME CLOSE- I WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE BY QUICKLY TELLING A STORY THAT SHOWS THE REAL WORLD IMPACT THESE COURTS CAN HALF THE STORY SHE PHILLIPS WHICH IS TOLD IN THE SACBEE ARTICLE YOU HAVE IN FRONT OF YOU TODAY PHYLLIS WAS ARRESTED A LITTLE MORE THAN TWO YEARS AGO FOR SECOND DEGREE BURGLARY AFTER BREAKING INTO AN UNLOCKED SHED AND USING THE OWNER'S KITCHEN AND BARBECUE TO COOK FOR HERSELF FOR DAYS WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF A SCHIZOPHRENIC EPISODE. EXASPERATED BY HER DRUG ADDICTION. AND THOUGHT THE HOUSE WAS HER OWN. THIS WAS HER SECOND STRIKE WHICH CARRIED A MANDATORY SENTENCE OF THREE YEARS IN PRISON. ONE YEAR AND THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY THREE DAYS LATER PHILIP STOOD ONCE MORE IN A SACRAMENTO COURTROOM. BUT THIS TIME THE MOOD WAS VERY DIFFERENT. IT WAS HER GRADUATION DAY. AS A RESULT OF THE SACRAMENTO'S INNOVATIVE MENTAL HEALTH COURT SHE HAD COMPLETED HER PROGRAM WITH DISTINCTION IN JUST ELEVEN MONTHS AND IS NOW WORKING AS A DRUG AND ALCOHOL COUNSELOR. FOR WELL SPACE IN SACRAMENTO. THIS IS JUST ONE EXAMPLE OF. A OUT OF MANY OF AN INDIVIDUAL WHO HAS HAD THE LIFE CHANGING RESULTS THANKS TO AN INNOVATIVE MENTAL HEALTH COURT DIVERSION PROGRAM. WE MUST DO A BETTER JOB WE MUST DO A BETTER JOB. AS A STATE OF PRIORITIZING THE NEEDS OF A MENTALLY ILL POPULATIONS I BELIEVE SB FOURTEEN TWENTY SEVEN IS A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE CALL THE ROLL AND AGAIN THIS IS- DO YOU PASSED WITH AGREEMENT THAT THERE WILL BE THE AMENDMENT WORKED OUT AND TAKEN- IN APPROACH BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE THE BILL GOES NEXT SECTOR ACT THEY GET THAT RIGHT OKAY. PROCEED WITH THE ROLL CALL. SB FOURTEEN TWENTY SEVEN- SKINNER. HI SKINNER I THE TROUBLED I TROUBLE GUY COM LAGER WINNER. WIENER AYE. EXCELLENT AT FARM WILL HOLD THE ROLE OPEN FOR OUR MISSING MEMBER BUT YOU HAVE A THREE AYE SO WE WILL NOW MOVE TO SB FOURTEEN TWENTY SIX SENATOR CAFIERO. IF THE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. THANKS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT SB FOURTEEN TWENTY SIX AND COMMITTEES TODAY. THIS BILL WILL WILL MAKE IT A FELONY PUNISHABLE BY UP TO THREE YEARS IN JAIL IF AN OPERATOR OF AN ILLEGAL CANNABIS GROW SITE IS FOUND TO HAVE STOLEN WATER TAMPERED WITH WATER INFRASTRUCTURE DOUG AND UNPERMITTED WELL OR POLLUTED GROUNDWATER SOURCES. CALIFORNIA'S ARID CLIMATE MEANS THAT EVERY YEAR REGARDLESS OF THE YEARS RAIN OUTPUT OUR WATER RESOURCES ARE STRETCHED THIN. EVEN DURING SEASONS OF AVERAGE RAINFALL AND SNOW CALIFORNIA WATER RESOURCES ARE OVERSUBSCRIBED THERE IS NOT ENOUGH WATER IN OUR SYSTEM TO MEET ALL OF THE NEEDS OF OUR RESIDENTS THIS YEAR CALIFORNIA IS PROJECTED TO BE HEADED TOWARDS A HISTORIC ONE THOUSAND YEAR DROUGHT. AS ONE OF THE CONSISTENTLY CONSISTENTLY DRY PROLONGED PERIODS IN RECORDED HISTORY SCARY THING. ORDING TO MEASUREMENTS COLLECTED FROM THIS YEAR ALONE CALIFORNIA'S SNOWPACK IS AT 39% OF ITS AVERAGE LEVEL AND IT IS 23% LOWER THAN THIS TIME LAST YEAR SO IT'S GETTING WORSE. LOW SNOW PACK MEANS OUR WATER SUPPLY FROM SNOW FALL WILL NOT MEET DEMANDS IN THE SUMMER AND THE FALL. THE AGRICULTURAL ALLOCATION FROM THE FEDERAL AND STATE WATER PROJECTS WILL BE ZERO THIS YEAR. AS OF MARCH THIRTY FIRST ALMOST ALL OF THE STATE IS UNDER SEVERE DROUGHT CONDITIONS WITH LARGE PARTS OF THE NORTHERN AND CENTRAL AREAS OF THE STATE EXPERIENCING EXTREME DROUGHT. I SHARE THIS DATA WITH YOU TODAY BECAUSE THAT IS THAT IN LARGE PART THE MOTIVATION. BEHIND THE BILL BEFORE THE COMMITTEE. ILLICIT CANNABIS CULTIVATORS IN CALIFORNIA ARE THREATENING BOTH ABOVE AND BELOW GROUND WATER SUPPLIES SUPPLIES THAT ARE LIFELINES FOR RURAL COMMUNITIES AND URBAN CENTERS ALIKE. ACCORDING TO A RECENT CAL MATTER STUDY EXAMPLES OF WATER THEFT BY ILLICIT CANNABIS GROWS IN THE STATE ARE PROLIFIC. IN THE HIGH DESERT F LOS ANGELES COUNTY WATER THEFT RESULTED IN A WATER SHUT OFF TO OVER THREE HUNDRED HOMES IN MENDOCINO COUNTY THE RUSSIAN RIVER IS BECOMING DEPLETED. BECAUSE RIVERS AND STREAMS THAT FEED INTO IT ARE BEING DIVERTED. THE BROOKINGS INSTITUTE REPORTED RECENTLY THAT THIS SAYS ACTIVITY HAS LED TO OVER TWENTY FOUR STREAMS IN THE REGIONS. IN THE REGION GOING DRY A DEVASTATING OUTCOME FOR LOCAL COMMUNITIES. LAST YEAR IN SISKIYOU COUNTY ILLEGAL CANNABIS CULTIVATORS STOLE AS MUCH AS TWO MILLION GALLONS OF WATER PER DAY. ENOUGH WATER TO SUPPLY UP TO THREE QUARTERS OF ITS POPULATION. IN TWENTY TWENTY THE BROOKINGS INSTITUTE ESTIMATED THAT UPWARDS OF NINE POINT FIVE MILLION GALLONS OF WATER WAS DIVERTED BY ILLEGAL CANNABIS ACTIVITIES THAT'S DRINKING WATER FOR OUR COMMUNITIES WATER FOR ENVIRONMENTAL HABITAT TO SUPPORT FISH AND WILDLIFE. AND WATER TO CAN HELP COMBAT FOREST FIRES CURRENT LAW DOES NOT PROVIDE A DETERRENT OR RESOURCES TO TRACK AND STOP THE ILLICIT ACTIVITIES OF A MULTI BILLION DOLLAR CRIMINAL INDUSTRY. THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD HAS THE AUTHORITY TO FIND ILLEGAL CANNABIS OPERATIONS UP TO A THOUSAND DOLLARS A DAY FOR STEALING WATER BUT FOR THIS LEVEL OF CRIMINAL ACTIVITY IF FINE IS SIMPLY NOT ENOUGH. IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN STATE OFFICIALS CHARGED OVER ONE MILLION DOLLARS IN FINES TO OVER A THOUSAND WATER RIGHTS VIOLATORS YET WE CONTINUE TO SEE A GROWING PROBLEM. IN ADDITION TO CRIMINALIZING WATER THEFT THIS BILL ALSO ENHANCES PENALTIES FOR GROUND WATER POLLUTION AND ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION. ILLICIT CANNABIS CULTIVATORS DO NOT ABIDE BY THE STATE REGULATIONS REGARDING PROPER PESTICIDE INSECTICIDE AND RODENTICIDE USE AND DISPOSAL AS A RESULT LARGER MONTH AMOUNT TOXIC CHEMICALS ARE USED STORED AND DISPOSED OF IMPROPERLY AND CAUSE DAMAGE TO OUR STATE SURFACE. AND GROUNDWATER RESOURCES IN ADDITION THE USE OF RODENTICIDES INADVERTENTLY POISONED CREDITORS THE CONSUMER RODENTS THAT HAVE BEEN EXPOSED TO THE CHEMICALS. FOR ALL THESE REASONS I ASK YOU CONSIDER ADDING CRIMINAL PENALTIES I BELIEVE THATPUNISHING THIS ACTIVITY IS A CRIMINAL OFFENSE IS NOT ONLY WARRANTED BUT ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL TO PROTECT OUR NATURAL RESOURCES AND VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES WHO ARE DEPENDENT ON DWINDLING WATER SUPPLIES AND DELIVERIES. AFTER LISTENING TO CONCERNS RAISED BY MEMBER MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AND COMMITTED TODAY TO HELP ADDRESS THESE CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED SHOULD THE BILL PASS THE COMMITTEE I WILL- AGREEDTO AMEND THE BILL TO REDUCE THE PENALTY TO A WOBBLER THUS ALLOWING THE COURTS THE DISCRETION. TO DETERMINE THE CHARGE OUT NUMBER ONE AND NUMBER TWO TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF PLANTS IT WOULD BE SUBJECT TO THE PENALTY FROM SIX TO FIFTY. WE'RE NOT LOOKING FOR THE SMALL TIME BACKYARD GROWERS WE'RE LOOKING FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE DOING THIS IS A COMMERCIAL ACTIVITY. AND ARE ARE DOING IT HIDDEN- USUALLY IN RURAL AND- ISOLATED. LOCATIONS WITH THAT I WOULD REDUCE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS. I THANK YOU FOR ALL OF THE COMMENTS BECAUSE I THINK THEY WERE VERY HELPFUL. THANK YOU SENATOR CAFIERO LET'S GO TO YOUR- LEAD WITNESS IN- SUPPORT- MADAM CHAIR IT'S THEIR THIRD DECK DECK IT WITH THE RURAL COUNTY REPRESENTATIVES OF CALIFORNIA AND NICOLE WARDMAN LEGISLATIVE ADDED ADVOCATE WITH PRECISION PRECISION ADVOCACY ON BEHALF OF SAN BERNADINO COUNTY GRACE HERE IN PERSON RIGHT EXCELLENT YOU GO HEAD. GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN SKINNER AND MEMBERS- THE COLD WAR LIMON WITH PRECISION ADVOCACY HERE ON BEHALF OF SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY- THIS WROTE THE PROUD SPONSOR OF SB FOURTEEN TWENTY SIX. ILLEGAL CANNABIS FARMS ARE A SERIOUS GROWING THREAT IN ACROSS RURAL AREAS OF CALIFORNIA. ILLEGAL CANNABIS CULTIVATORS FREQUENTLY ENGAGE IN HUMAN TRAFFICKING WATER THEFT AND ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION AS PART OF THEIR pSEVERAL YEARS THOUSANDS OF ILLEGAL GROWS HAVE POPPED UP IN THE DESERT COMMUNITIES OF SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY. BECAUSE SOME CULTIVATION SITES GO UNDETECTED FOR YEARS THE ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE COULD LAST GENERATIONS. CALIFORNIA STATE PENALTIES ARE NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO DETER THESE LARGE SCALE CRIMINALS FROM ENGAGING IN WIDESPREAD ILLICIT CANNABIS FARMING NOR DO THEY RECOGNIZE THE DANGER THAT THE ILLEGAL THE ILLEGAL GROWS POST TO THE ENVIRONMENT LONG TERM. ILLEGAL CANNABIS FARMERS FREQUENTLY BREAK WATER PIPES AND INFRASTRUCTURE TO STEAL WATER OR DIG ON PERMITTED ILLEGAL WELLS TO TAP GROUNDWATER. ADDITIONALLY THE WIDESPREAD USE OF DANGEROUS AND DEADLY PESTICIDES ADOLESCENT CANNABIS FARMS CAN BE LETHAL TO BOTH HUMANS AND WILDLIFE POSING IMMEDIATE AND LONG TERM RISKS TO THOSE WORKING IN AND NEAR THE SITE. IF YOU COULD WRAP UP BECAUSE THE OTHER TO WITNESS YES IT'S THEIR TIME YES TODAY WE'RE ASKING YOU TO PASS SB. FOURTEEN TWENTY SIX TO ASSIST IN COMBATING THE DAMAGE DONE PAY ILLICIT CULTIVATION IN OUR RURAL COMMUNITIES. AS I HAVE THE SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY LEGISLATIVE AND GOVERNMENTAL AFFAIRS.

FOR EXAMPLE MENDOCINO COUNTY THE FIRST CANDIDATE TO DECLARE A DROUGHT IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWENTY WANT. TO LOOK WATER ALL. FOR EXAMPLE RIDE WITHOUT WATER TO WHICH IS IN A MORE TO.

THE PRESIDENT OF THE- WITH OUR COMMUNITY TO MAKE PERMITTING CAN PRIME BURKE HINDERS THE LEGAL INDUSTRY ADDITIONAL TOOLS ARE NEEDED PROTECT THE PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY AND FURTHER DISCOURAGE ILLICIT CANNABIS OPERATORS.

I THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- SO FOR THE THANK YOU THE AUTHOR FOR- ACCEPT ACCEPTING AMENDMENTS TO. A REDUCES TO WOBBLER AND ALSO TO SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE THE NUMBER OF PLANTS. THROUGHOUT SWEEPING UP THE YOU KNOW THE SMALL. OF VIOLATORS- YOU'RE NORMALLY- I DON'T YOUR TECHNICAL SUPPORT BILLS THAT CREATE NEW CRIMES- AND I DON'T BE HONEST I DO HAVE SOME TREPIDATION ABOUT- THIS BILL BECAUSE- YOU KNOW JUST BECAUSE OF THE RISK OF. THIRTY NINE YOU KNOW THE OWNERS- THE KINGPINS WHO ARE BEING- ARRESTED SOMETIMES IT'S THE SORT OF MORE UNFORTUNATE ENOUGH TO BE LIKE. TENDING THE PLANTS OR OR OR WHATEVER- SO I DO HAVE CONCERNS I'LL BE HONEST- I ALSO THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT ISSUE- IN VARIOUS PARTS OF THE STATE WITH THESE ILLEGAL GROWS THAT ARE REALLY. DEEPLY DESTRUCTIVE ENVIRONMENTALLY- REALLY REALLY REALLY HARMFUL AND BAD- SO THIS KIND OF BEHAVIOR IS NOT. IT'S NOT YOU KNOW HARM US IT'S REALLY- IT'S JUST CAUSING A LOT OF- ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION IN VARIOUS PARTS OF THE STATE- SO I WILL- SUPPORT MOVING THE BILL OUT OF COMMITTEE TODAY WITH THOSE ON AMENDMENTS. UNDERSTANDING THAT I HOPE THAT YOU'LL CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS AS IT MOVES THROUGH THE- PROCESS. I DO I WOULD BE REMISS IF I ABOUT THIS OPPORTUNITY- GO BY JUST- REMIND PEOPLE THAT THE REASON THAT THESE ILLEGAL GROWS EXISTEN ARE PROLIFERATING SO MUCH. IS BECAUSE DESPITE THE CLEAR WILL OF THE VOTERS- THAT CANNABIS IS TO BE A LEGAL PRODUCT BOTH MEDICINALLY AND FOR ADULT USE- WE HAVE AND- YOU KNOW THE FACT THAT. WHAT SIXTY FOUR ENTRUSTED CITIES TO BE RESPONSIBLE ACTORS IN REGULATING CANNABIS SALES ON THE VAST MAJORITY OF CALIFORNIA CITIES BANNED ANY AT ALL SALE OF CANNABIS SO IT'S LEGAL FOR PEOPLE TO USE CANNABIS TO POSSESS A- BUT YOU CAN'T LEGALLY BUY IT ANYWHERE. IT'S A STUPID SYSTEM I'M SORRY IT'S JUST A TERRIBLE HORRIBLE SYSTEM WE'RE SAYING- YEAH WE'RE WE'RE LEGALIZING CANNABIS FOR MEDICINE FOR OTHER USE BUT WE'RE GONNA ACTUALLY JUST MAKE IT LOOK ILLEGAL TO ACTUALLY HAVE A LEGAL MARKET IN THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE STATE. HI AND THEN ON TOP OF IT WE PUT HUGE TAXES ON THE LEGAL MARKET. AND WE CREATE A HUGE INCENTIVES FOR THE ILLICIT MARKET TO FLOURISH BECAUSE WE MAKE IT SO EXPENSIVE FOR LEGITIMATE OPERATORS TO OPERATE AND MAKE THE PRODUCT REALLY EXPENSIVE. SO WE SET UP A HORRIBLE SYSTEM THAT FUELS THE ILLICIT MARKET WHICH INCLUDES ILLEGAL GROWS AND WE NEED TO FIX THAT AND WE HAVE SOME BILLS THIS YEAR. TO TRY TO START MOVING IN THAT DIRECTION- AND I AM SYMPATHETIC TO WHAT FOR EXAMPLE RC RC WAS SAYING BUT OUR CRC IS ALSO OPPOSING EFFORTS. TO TRY TO EXPAND ACCESS TO MEDICAL CANNABIS IN CALIFORNIA SO ENCOURAGE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS NOT JUST TO BE UPSET ABOUT ILLEGAL GROWS BUT TO ALSO BE PART OF THE SOLUTION AND THE STOP OBSTRUCTING THE LEGAL SALE OF CANNABIS. THANK YOU. I THINK FOR THE FIRST TIME I FEEL LIKE I NEED TO HUG SENATOR WIENER. SUPPORTING THE BILL PUBLIC SAFETY BUT I WILL A THE CORE IN THE COMMITTEE ON THAT END- THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY SPEAK AS SOMEONE DO YOU KNOW COUNTY IS A DISTRICT THAT I REPRESENT I'M ACUTELY AWARE OF THIS ISSUE IS ILLEGAL CANNABIS GROW CANNABIS GROWERS ARE AN ISSUE FACING MANY OTHER CITIES AND THEY ARE DIRECTLY IMPACTING THE HEALTH OF OUR COMMUNITIES. THE UNREGULATED USE OF PESTICIDES ON THESE GROW SITES IS POLLUTING OUR GROUNDWATER WHICH IS HAS WHICH HAS A DETRIMENTAL EFFECT ON THE HEALTH AND WELL BEING OF OUR CONSTITUENTS AND USUALLY IN THE MOST RURAL PARTS OF OUR OF CALIFORNIA THE EXPANSION OF THE PENALTIES RELATING TO ILLEGAL GROW SITES AND THE TOPPING OVER GROUNDWATER WILL BE BETTER EQUIPPED AT WILL BETTER EQUIP LAW ENFORCEMENT WITH THE RESOURCES THAT THEY NEED TO COMBAT THESE ILLEGAL OPERATIONS. WHEN WE CONSIDER THE INTENSE DROUGHT FACING CALIFORNIA THESE GROW SITES ALSO POSE A RISK TO OUR GROUND- AB- WATER MANAGEMENT AS THEIR E. LEGALLY SIPHONING LARGE QUANTITIES OF OUR GROUNDWATER FOR THEIR OWN REGULATED USE UNREGULATED USE I'M SORRY. THE LEGAL TOPPING OUR GROUNDWATER IN THE DUMPING OF PESTICIDES BY ILLEGAL CANNABIS GROW SITES IS PERTINENT AND DANGEROUS ISSUE FACING OUR ECONOMY AND OUR COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND ESPECIALLY THE INLAND EMPIRE- BUT I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO NOTE. THAT IT IS ALSO- IN A VERY IF. THE ACTUAL LAND ITSELF NOT JUST THE GROUND WATER ON THAT END AND HAVING HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO TOWARDS SOME OF THE SITES I CAN TELL YOU THAT IS- IT IS HEARTENING IT'S ALSO DISHEARTENING IN THE FACT THAT THEY CAN COME BACK OVER AND OVER AGAIN QUITE- OFTEN IT JUST BY THE NEXT WEEK. IS ACTUALLY ALSO VERY TROUBLESOME SO THANK YOU SENATOR A COUPLE YEAR FOR TAKING THE LEAD ON THIS ISSUE AND I'M SO GRATEFUL THAT YOU DID. AND I A WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL. THANK YOU- FOR WE GO TO- YOUR CLOTHES I HAVE SOME COMMENTS- WEEK THE DIFFICULTY WITH THIS BILL FOR ME IS THAT WE HAVE EXISTING- CRIMINAL STATUTE FOR THE POLLUTING OF THE GROUND WATER OR THE POLLUTING OF THE SOIL FOR YOU KNOW FROM THE PESTICIDE USE AND SUCH AND THE WHAT THIS BILL IS FOCUSED ON IS THE STEALING OF THE GROUNDWATER NOW STEALING A GROWN ORDERS SERIOUS. AND IS A FORMER DIRECTOR OF THE EAST BAY REAP REGIONAL PARK DISTRICT WHICH HAS A HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES OF OPEN SPACE WE HAD A LOT OF ILLEGAL GROWS WE DID AND SO WE- BUT UNFORTUNATELY MOST OF THE TIME. WHEN WE WOULD- WHEN OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT WOULD GO TO THOSE GROWS EITHER THERE WASN'T THERE WAS NO ONE THERE AND IT WAS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO EVER TRACE WHO ACTUALLY OPERATED TO GROW OR IF THERE WAS SOMEONE THERE IT WAS SOMEONE IT WAS. INTERNET ANALOGOUS TO SORT OF THE STREET. THE PERSON ON THE STREET TO SELLING THE DRUG IT'S NOT THE PERSON THAT THAT PERSON WHO IS AT THE GROW IS JUST YOU KNOW FIRST UNFORTUNATELY. BEING PAID BY SOMEBODY TO TENDED VERSES THAT THEY SET UP THE GROW. AND SO MY CONCERN. I'VE YOU KNOW I APPRECIATE THE AMENDMENTS BUT MY CONCERN IS THAT WE WILL. BE ONCE AGAIN. ENFORCING THE LAW ON REALLY- IT PERIPHERAL CHARACTERS COMPARED TO THE ACTUAL PEOPLE WHO ARE TAPPING INTO GROUNDWATER IN CAUSING THE ILLEGAL GROW. AND THAT'S WHAT'S SO DIFFICULT IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES HOWEVER AND WE HAVE BEEN STOPPING MANY MANY BILLS YOU KNOW FOR EXAMPLE ONE FEDERAL FOR EXACTLY THAT REASON BECAUSE TO JUST TWO. HITS LIKE AND THAT YOU CAN TAKE ALL THE LOS STREET DEALERS OFF AND YET YOU'RE STILL GOING TO HAVE THIS EVENT- IT'S SO CHEAP IT'S SO. AT THE BIG QUANTITY YOU NEED TO SO TINY YOU KNOW THERE YOU JUST KEEP FILL IT YOU KNOW THERE'S ANOTHER ANOTHER ENTITY WHAT WILL COME IN AND SELL IT UNLESS WE CAN GET AT THE ACTUAL MANUFACTURERS OF IT OR THE- OR THE ORGANIZERS OF THE- YOU KNOW PICKING PENCE'S THEY SAY. NOW THE TWO HERE AND THE REASON THAT I BE WILLING TO MAKE THE EXCEPTION IS THAT WE HAVE LEGALIZED MARIJUANA. AND SO. THERE IS IT THAT REALLY THERE IS NO REASON TO HAVE ILLEGAL GROWS WIENER. ANY COUNTY THAT SUPPORTS THIS BILL BETTER MAKE IT LEGALLY AVAILABLE TO BUY CANNABIS IN THEIR AREA BECAUSE WE HAVE OUR VERY OWN. LEGAL LAW HAS ENCOURAGED THE ILLICIT BUSINESS. AND IT IS FOR THOSE PEOPLE THAT ARE PLAYING BY THE RULES THEY ARE BEING PUNISHED NOW THE ENTITIES THAT ARE OPERATING LEGAL GROWS. SO THIS IS WHY I AM WILLING TO MAKE THAT EXCEPTION I'M STILL UNCOMFORTABLE WITH IN EFFECT YOU KNOW HAVING ANYBODY EVEN THOSE A WAFFLER GET A DOUBLE FELONY WHO IS JUST STATE REALLY MAKE A MINOR PARTICIPANT- AND- MAYBE I'M DOING A WILLING SUSPENSION OF DISBELIEF THE HOPING THAT DA'S WOULD. RESHAPE THOSE CANISTER. AND NOT CHARGE THE FULL FELONY. ARMED AND YOU KNOW WE COULD GO ON THE ROUTE OF. TRYING TO ADD JUST MORE- FEES CIVIL PENALTIES VERSUS A CRIME BUT HOWEVER AGAIN IF IT'S A FIT PLAYER THEY DON'T HAVE THE MONEY TO PAY IT ANYWAY SO THIS IS ALL TRICKY. BUT IT IS THE CASE THAT THIS IS A LEGAL. DRUG AND WE HAVE TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO DISCOURAGE ANYTHING THAT IS UNDERMINING THE LEGAL- OUR LEGAL MARKET PLACE. SO I WILL SUPPORT IT AND I REALLY APPRECIATE THE AMENDMENTS AND- GO AHEAD YES I KNOW I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY IF I AM AT THE MEMBERS WILL BE TAKEN AND THE NEXT COMMITTEE AND NOT. HERE BECAUSE- THAT IT IS A WOBBLER AND THAT THE THRESHOLD OF PLANTS IS GOING TO BE FIFTY OR ABOVE. CORRECT SO ANY OTHER COMMENT BEFORE GO AHEAD SIR. AND I'M SORRY TO SEE THE STRESS AGAIN I'M GOING TO SUPPORT THE US BECAUSE PEOPLE SHOULD BE ACCOUNTABLE FOR THIS ENVIRONMENTAL DESTRUCTION. HOWEVER THIS WILL BE ABLE IT WAS JUST KEEP HAPPENING THESE GROWTH WILL JUST BE REPLACED BY NEW ILLEGAL GROWS UNTIL THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA STARTS ALLOWING LEGAL OPERATIONS OF CANNABIS EVERY ROUTE THE STATE. AND HAD NOT HAVING THESE HUGE SWATHS WERE IT IS. EFFECTIVELY ILLEGAL- AND SO OF COURSE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO DO IT ILLEGALLY AND DESTROY THE ENVIRONMENT. GOOD CENTER. AND I ALSO JUST WANT TO ADD YOU KNOW IT'S NOT JUST THAT BUT IT'S GETTING OUR ACT TOGETHER WITH THE REGULATED MARKET PLACE AND ALL OF AND DRIVES SENATOR KABIR ON I SAID ON THE SAME COMMITTEE AND WE HAVE HEARD. A NUMBER OF PANELISTS TALK ABOUT HOW CHALLENGING IT IS- IN THIS PARTICULAR SPACE. YOU ARE CERTAINLY ENCOURAGING THIS KIND OF ACTIVITY UNTIL WE GET A COMPREHENSIVE REALISTIC HOLISTIC APPROACH TO THIS MARKET. AND HOW WE WOW WE ALLOW HOW WE REGULATE HOW WE ENFORCE WHAT REAL IMPLEMENTATION LOOKS LIKE SO THAT EVERYONE FEELS LIKE IF THEY WANT TO PARTICIPATE THEY CAN IN A WAY THAT MAKES SENSE.

WELCOME SENATOR GROWTH YOU MAY PRESENT SENATE BILL TEN FORTY TWO THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS. SENATE BILL TEN FORTY TWO IS A BI PARTISAN OR BIPARTISAN MEASURE THAT IS JOINT AUTHORED BY SENATOR CAFIERO AND CO AUTHORED BY EIGHT SENATORS N. THIRTEEN ASSEMBLY MEMBERS. OUR BILL WOULD INCLUDE HUMAN TRAFFICKING IN THE LIST OF CRIMES THAT ARE DEFINED AS SERIOUS AND VIOLENT UNDER CALIFORNIA LAW MAKING THE CRIME AND A STRIKE UNDER THE THREE STRIKES LAW. THE FASTEST GROWING CRIMINAL INDUSTRY IN THE WORLD IS THE BUYING AND SELLING OF HUMAN BEINGS. IN CALIFORNIA IS ONE OF THE LARGEST HUBS FOR HUMAN TRAFFICKING. DATA FROM SERVICE PROVIDERS IN THE U. S. NATIONAL HUMAN TRAFFICKING HOTLINE HAS CONSISTENTLY SHOWN THAT GROUPS WHO EXPERIENCE MARGINALIZATION OR MARGINALIZED BY RACE INCOME GENDER IDENTITY SEXUAL ORIENTATION OR IMMIGRATION STATUS THEY ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE EXPLOITED THROUGH SEX AND LABOR TRAFFICKING. THE INTERNATIONAL LABOR ORGANIZATION ESTIMATES THAT IN THE LAST DECADE THERE WERE MORE THAN FORTY MILLION HUMAN TRAFFICKING VICTIMS WORLDWIDE. OF THAT TOTAL WOMEN AND GIRLS LET THAT SINK IN FOR JUST A MINUTE. THAT'S AN ESTIMATED THIRTY MILLION WOMEN AND GIRLS THAT ARE VICTIMS OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING. CURRENTLY THERE ARE FORTY TWO CRIMES THAT ARE DEFINED AS SERIOUS AND TWENTY THREE CRIMES THAT ARE DEFINED AS VIOLENT UNDER CALIFORNIA LAW. TODAY IN CALIFORNIA LAW ROBBERY IS A VIOLENT FELONY SOMEBODY CAN WALK INTO A BANK HAD A NOTE TO THE TELLER DEMANDING THE MONEY IN THEIR CASH DRAWER AND THAT IS CONSIDERED A SERIES OF VIOLENT FELONY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. BUT SEX TRAFFICKING A CHILD IS NOT. TODAY IN CALIFORNIA CARJACKING IS LISTED AS A SERIOUS FELONY AND RIGHTFULLY SO BUT THE ACT OF SELLING A HUMAN BEING IS NOT. SP TEN FORTY TWO WILL HELP STRENGTHEN PROTECTIONS FOR THE MILLIONS OF VICTIMS OF SEX AND LABOR TRAFFICKING TO SERVE AS A DETERRENT FOR THOSE WHO WISH TO WISH TO PERPETRATE THIS HORRENDOUS CRIME. ALWAYS I CAN TELL YOU THIS IS THE HARDEST BILL THAT MY STAFF AND I HAVE EVER RESEARCHED THE STORIES OF YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN THAT ARE TRAFFICKED ON A DAILY BASIS ARE ALMOST TOO MUCH TO BEAR- TALLY AND IN HUMANITY OF THESE VICTIMS. AND WHAT THEY ENDORSE SOMETHING OUT OF A HORROR MOVIE TRAFFICKING TASK FORCE RECENTLY SHARED A STORY FROM ONE OF THEIR HUMAN TRAFFICKING INVESTIGATIONS IN WHICH TWO FEMALE THAT VICTIMS WERE HELD CAPTIVE INSIDE OF THE BED FRAME. AT A MOTEL AFTER ATTEMPTING TO RUN AWAY THEY WERE BEING TRAFFICKED FOR COMMERCIAL SEX IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. THE TRAFFICKERS PLACE THE MATTRESS BACK ON TOP OF THE BED FRAME AS THEY SLEPT TO KEEP THEM FROM ESCAPING. THE VICTIMS WERE LEFT NAKED WITH WATER POURED OVER THEM IN THE AIR CONDITIONING DOWN TO A FREEZING LEVEL FORCED TO URINATE THEM ON THEMSELVES AND HAD CEREAL CHEERIOS THROWN AT THEM TO EAT OFF THE FLOOR. THE VIOLENCE AND TORTURED TORTURE THAT IS ENDORSED BY THESE VICTIMS ALSO INCLUDED RAPE SODOMY AND BEATINGS. ONE OF THE FEMALE VICTIMS AS RAPE WITH A GUN HELD TO YOUR MOUTH. THE VICTIMS WERE FORCED TO STAY INSIDE THE BED FRAME WHILE WAITING FOR THE SEX PURCHASERS ANSWERING ADS THAT WERE POSTED ONLINE. ART FROM THE PHYSICAL ABUSE ONE VICTIM HAD MEDICAL COMPLICATIONS DUE TO MAKEUP SPONGES BEING INSERTED INTO HER VAGINAL CANAL DURING THE MENSTRUAL CYCLE AS PART OF THE WORK MANTRA FROM RETRACTING TRAFFICKER IT SAYS NO DAYS OFF. WHICH IS COMMON FOR VICTIMS OF SEX TRAFFICKING. IN JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY TWO FOX ELEVEN NEWS IN LOS ANGELES SHARED A STORY OF A SIXTEEN YEAR OLD SIMONE WHO WAS KIDNAPPED AND TRAFFICKED BY A MAN SHE JUST MET. SIMONE WAS IMMEDIATELY TAKEN INTO A HOTEL WHERE OTHER WOMEN WERE BEING HELD. AND SHE WAS FORCED TO SELL HER BODY. SOMEONE SAYS A TRAFFICKER WARNED HER THAT IF SHE TRIED TO ESCAPE HE WOULD KILL HER MOTHER AND HER GRANDMOTHER. SIMONE WAS FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO ESCAPE AFTER MAKING A CALL TO HER MOTHER AND HER KID WINNER CAPTIVES CAPTORS GUARD WAS DOWN.

IN A HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM YET SHE HAD NOWHERE TO ESCAPE SHE HAD NO MONEY HE SPOKE LIMITED ENGLISH AND- SHE HAD SPOKE LIMITED ENGLISH. PROTECTING THEIR INVESTMENT THE COUPLE PURCHASED WHO PURCHASED METAL HAD INTIMIDATED HER WITH THE THREAT OF JAIL IF SHE EVER DARED TO RENT. HEN THE VIOLENCE WORSENED IN YEAR THREE MY TOOL MANAGED TO WRITE A NOTE TO THE NANNY NEXT DOOR THAT SHE HAD GOTTEN TO KNOW WHICH SIMPLY READ. PLEASE HELP ME. HUMAN TRAFFICKING SURVIVOR SUCH AS THESE COMMUNITY GROUPS DISTRICT ATTORNEYS AND LAW ENFORCEMENT FROM ACROSS THE STATE HAVE STOOD IN SUPPORT OF SB TEN FORTY TWO. IN FEBRUARY OF THIS YEAR TWENTY TWENTY TO THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT. PARTICIPATED IN AN OPERATION RECLAIM AND REBUILD WHICH RESULTED IN THE ARREST OF THIRTY TRAFFICKERS.

TEN FORTY TWO IS RECEIVED OVER FIFTY LETTERS OF SUPPORT FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES DISTRICT ATTORNEYS AND COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS SUCH AS THE- WE INTERNATIONAL. CRIME VICTIMS UNITED ALLIANCE AGAINST FAMILY VIOLENCE AND SEXUAL ASSAULT AND CHILDREN'S ADVOCACY CENTERS IN CALIFORNIA. IN ADDITION MY OFFICE HAS RECEIVED NEARLY THREE THOUSAND LETTERS OF SUPPORT FROM EVERYDAY CALIFORNIANS THAT JUST WANT TO SEE HUMAN TRAFFICKING PROPERLY DEFINED AS SERIOUS AND VIOLENT. ELIZABETH SMART HAS ENDORSED THIS BILL STATING THAT HAS TO BE TEN FORTY TWO SHOULD BE PASSED INTO LAW WITHOUT HESITATION. TOO MANY VICTIMS FEAR COMING FORWARD SPEAKING OUT FOR FEAR OF THEIR TRAFFICKERS REPERCUSSIONS TOO OFTEN THEY ARE RETRICTED IN THEIR EFFORTS TO SERVE JUSTICE AND FAR TOO OFTEN VICTIMS AND SURVIVORS NEVER EVEN GET A GLIMPSE AT JUSTICE. TRAFFICKING IS A HEINOUS AND BRUTAL CRIME THANKFULLY MANY OF US WILL NEVER HAVE TO EXPERIENCE THIS IS A SMALL STEP THAT WE CAN TAKE TO BEGIN PROTECTING OUR SURVIVORS IN PROCRIT PROCRIT. SOME SMALL MODERN FORM OF JUSTICE. CALIFORNIANS ACROSS THE STATE HAVE SHARED THEIR PERSONAL STORIES AND VOICED VOICE THEIR SUPPORT FOR S. B. THIRTEEN FORTY TWO. BUT HERE WITH ME TO SHARE THEIR TESTIMONY DIRECTLY OURTWO EXPERTS IN THE HUMAN TRAFFICKING FIELD. FULLY ENTRENCHED IN COMBATING HUMAN TRAFFICKING OAKLAND DISTRICT ATTORNEY NANCY O'MALLEY'S OFFICE HAS PROSECUTED MORE THAN EIGHT HUNDRED HUMAN SEX TRAFFICKING CASES A MAJORITY OF WHICH HAVE INVOLVED MINOR FEMALE VICTIMS DEAL MALLEY HAS HANDLED NUMEROUS CASES IN WHICH THE VICTIMS WERE MURDERED. PHYSICALLY ABUSED PSYCHOLOGICALLY TERRORIZED MANIPULATED AND COERCED AND LEFT TO DEAL WITH THE TRAGIC AFTERMATH OF BEING SEX TRAFFICKED. TRAFFIC WE ARE PLEASED TO HAVE D. E. O. MALLEY TESTIFY FIRST IN SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE. ADDITIONALLY IN ORDER TO SHINE A LIGHT ON THIS ISSUE WITH FIRST HAND KNOWLEDGE MY SECOND WITNESS IS A CONSTITUENT OF MINE IN MY DISTRICT THAT IS A HUMAN TRAFFICKING SURVIVOR SURVIVOR MISS ODESSA PERKINS- I'M SO SORRY WITH EVERYTHING THAT'S HAPPENED TODAY IN THE DELAY IN THE COMMITTEE I COMPLETELY FORGOT AND IT'S I DO APOLOGIZE PLEASE ACCEPT MY SINCERE APOLOGY WE HAVE A OUR JOINT AUTHOR. IS GOING TO MAKE A STATEMENT. ABSOLUTELY NO NO PROBLEM. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SAY A FEW BRIEF WORDS- CALIFORNIA IS ONE OF THE LARGEST SITES FOR HUMAN TRAFFICKING IN THE UNITED STATES. HUMAN TRAFFICKING AFFECTS WOMEN CHILDREN MEN PEOPLE OF COLOR IMMIGRANTS AND THE LGBTQ PLUS COMMUNITY ANYONE WHO IS VULNERABLE. S. B. TEN FORTY TWO ADS HUMAN TRAFFICKING TO THE LIST OF SERIOUS AND VIOLENT CRIMES IN THE PENAL CODE AND IT STRIKE FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE THREE STRIKES LAW. IT IS LONG OVERDUE FOR CALIFORNIA TO RECOGNIZE THEIR THEIR HORRENDOUS PAIN IN HUMAN SUFFERING AND THE LONG TERM DEVASTATION AND PSYCHOLOGICAL TRAUMA OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING ANDDO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. AS A JOINT AUTHOR OF THIS MEASURE MEASURE TODAY I ASK FOR YOUR IPHONE THANKS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SAY A FEW WORDS. THANK YOU MA'AM DISTRICT ATTORNEY O'MALLEY PLEASE. GOOD AFTERNOON SENATORS AND THANK YOU SENATOR GROWN CENTER CAMEO FOR YOU'RE YOU'RE REALLY REMARKABLE WORDS DESCRIBING THIS INSIDIOUS CRIME OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING. I AM THE CREATOR OF WHAT WE CALL HE'D WATCH HEAT MEANS HUMAN EXPLOITATION AND TRAFFICKING AND HE WATCHES A FIVE PRONGED COMMUNITY BLUEPRINT SO COMMUNITIES SUCH AS MY OWN IN ALAMEDA COUNTY. CAN I HAVE A STRATEGIC A FORMULA FOR CREATING THEIR OWN EFFORTS TO COMBAT HUMAN TRAFFICKING HE WATCHES BEEN ADOPTED THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES AND BY THE U. S. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES. AND THEIR HUMAN TRAFFICKING DIVISION I ALSO HAVE A FOUNDATION WHICH IS CALLED THE HEAT INSTITUTE. AND HE INSTITUTE OF FOCUSES ON RESEARCH AND STUDYING ROOT CAUSES OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING THE IMPACT OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING AS WELL AS THE MENTALITY AND THE PSYCHOLOGY OF A TRAFFICKER. AND A PURCHASER. WE HAVE A PUBLISHED DOCUMENTS FOR SURE AND ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT DOCUMENTS I BELIEVE WE HAVE PUBLISHED. IS A DOCUMENT THAT THAT EVALUATES THE DIFFERENT THERAPEUTIC MODALITIES THAT ARE EFFECTIVE IN HELPING HUMAN TRAFFICKING VICTIMS SURVIVORS RECOVER FROM THEIR TRAUMA AND BE ABLE TO HEAL FROM THE INJURIES THAT THEY'VE SUFFERED. I'VE WORKED ON THESE ISSUES AROUND HUMAN TRAFFICKING SINCE MY VERY FIRST CASE IN NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN. WHEN I HAD A THE VICTIM WAS IN TWELVE YEARS OLD. SHE WAS BEING TRAFFICKED BY A THIRTY NINE YEAR OLD MAN AND WHEN THE POLICE WERE ABLE TO INTERVENE AND RESCUE HER SHE WAS BEING RAPED BY A PERSON WHO PAID. TO RAPE HER WHO IS FIFTY YEARS OLD. I PROSECUTED BOTH THE TRAFFICKER AND THE PURCHASER BUT IN THOSE DAYS WE DID NOT HAVE A CRIME OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING WE DIDN'T HAVE A TERM CALLED HUMAN TRAFFICKING. SO IT'S BEEN MY EFFORTS EVER SINCE NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN TO REALLY CHANGE THE PARADIGM OF CALIFORNIA AROUND HOW WE VIEW HUMAN TRAFFICKING HOW WE USE TO JUDGE SO HARSHLY VICTIMS AND BLAME THEM FOR THEIR SITUATION. AND HOW WE HAVE DONE SO MUCH IN OUR COMMUNITY AND TO OUR LAWS TO REALLY CHANGE THAT PARADIGM. I WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT HUMAN TRAFFICKING AND FOR ME WHAT WE CALL HEAT WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT ADULT. PEOPLE WHO ARE ENGAGING IN COMMERCIAL SEX THAT'S A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT SITUATION FOR MOST THERE ARE ADULTS WHO HAVE BEEN TRAFFICKED SINCE CHILDHOOD. HAVE GROWN INTO CONTINUING THAT- COMMERCIAL SEX BUT WE'RE REALLY FOCUSING ON THOSE THAT ARE BEING. LURED INTO A TRAFFICKING ENVIRONMENT WHO ARE BEING HELD IN SLAVERY AND LET'S BE CLEAR HUMAN TRAFFICKING IS MODERN DAY SLAVERY. WE WORKED VERY HARD TO BRING ATTENTION TO HUMAN TRAFFICKING NOT ONLY IN CALIFORNIA BUT ACROSS THIS COUNTRY. EVERY STATE IN THE UNION HAS NOW IDENTIFIED HUMAN TRAFFICKING AS ONE OF THE MAJOR CRIMES IN THEIR STATE. WE HAVE WORKED VERY HARD ALSO TO BUILD A JUSTICE SYSTEM THAT RECOGNIZES THE DEEP PSYCHOLOGICAL IMPACT OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING THE PHYSICAL ABUSE THAT GOES ON THAT IS SO- I MEAN THE THEY ARE ALL YOU CAN SAY IT'S THE MOST INHUMANE TREATMENT OF INDIVIDUALS OF HUMAN BEINGS. AND WE HAVE LOOKED AT THE NUMBER OF TRAFFICKED VICTIMS WHO HAVE BEEN KILLED. SOME BY THE TRAFFICKER SOME BY THE PURCHASER. I ALSO WANT TO BRING TO THE ATTENTION OF THE COMMITTEE THE RESEARCH THAT'S BEING DONE NOT JUST AROUND HOW WHAT'S HAPPENING AND WHAT THE IMPACT THE LIFELONG IMPACT FOR SURVIVORS OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING BUT ALSO THE RESEARCH ON WHO IS THE TRAFFICKER WHAT'S IN THEIR PSYCHOLOGY. SO WE LOOK AT RESEARCH FROM CANADA AND THE UNITED STATES THAT HAS FOCUSED ON TRAFFICKERS IN IN SHORT WASN'T WHAT IS EMERGING FROM THAT THOSE THAT RESEARCH IS THE HIGH INCIDENT OF PSYCHOPATHY. PSYCHOPATHY IS DEFINED AS A PERSON WHO HAS NO CONSCIENCE WHO HAS NO CARING FOR ANOTHER AND THAT IS CLEARLY WHAT TRAFFICKERS ARE THEY ARE SELLING INDIVIDUALS WITHOUT REGARD FOR THE IMPACT ON THEM. THE REAL RESEARCH ALSO ADDRESSES THE PREDATORY NATURE OF THE CRIME OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING. AND THE VIOLENCE IN UTTER DISREGARD FOR THE IMPACT ON THE VICTIM OF TRAFFICKING. AND THERE IS NEVER JUST ONE VICTIM BEING TRAFFICKED BY A TRAFFICKER. IT IS AT THE EIGHT TRAFFICKER WHO FITS IN THE CATEGORY IN THE RESEARCH THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS SOMEONE WHO WILL CONTINUE TO LOWER CONTINUE TO RECRUIT CONTINUE TO PULL OTHER VICTIMS INTO THIS. IN MY OFFICE AS SENATOR GROSS SAID WE HAVE PROSECUTED OVER EIGHT HUNDRED CASES. THAT INVOLVES MORE THAN A THOUSAND VICTIMS OF SEX TRAFFICKING. RIGHT NOW WE HAVE SEVENTY EIGHT CASES PENDING WAITING FOR COURT ROOM TO BRING JUSTICE TO THE VICTIMS AND TO HOLD THAT TRAFFICKERS ACCOUNTABLE. WE ALSO HAVE CREATED- HAVE DONE SEVEN THOUSAND SAFETY PLANS FOR YOUNG. VICTIMS WHO ARE VULNERABLE TO BEING TRAFFICKED OR HAVE BEEN TRAFFICKED AND EXPLOITED. THE END OF THE AND NOW I JUST WANT TO ADDRESS ONE THING IN THE ANALYSIS AND THAT TALKS ABOUT THE STORY OF RENE. WHO HERSELF WAS TRAFFICKED BUT THEN I BECAME A RECRUITER IF YOU WILL. I WANT TO REMIND THE COMMITTEE THAT OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS YOUR THE LEGISLATURE HAS CREATED SEVERAL LAWS THAT REALLY PROTECT AND REQUIRE US WE DO IT ANYWAY THAT IT REQUIRES US TO LOOK AT THE- HISTORY OF AN INDIVIDUAL WHO GETS CAUGHT UP AS A PERPETRATOR OF CRIME AND I PUT THAT IN QUOTES. AND THAT WE ARE NOW REQUIRED TO LOOK AT WHETHER OR NOT THAT PARTICULAR INDIVIDUAL WAS THE VICTIM OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING IN THE EARLIER YEARS. WE ALSO HAVE BUILT YOU HAVE BUILT STRONG LAWS FOR VAGUE TO VACATING OLD CONVICTIONS OF SOMEBODY WHO WAS ACTUALLY BEING TRAFFICKED. WHAT WAS PROSECUTED AS A PERPETRATOR SO WE'RE BUILDING IT YOU ARE BUILDING IN THE PROTECTIONS BUT THE TIME IS NOW FOR CALIFORNIA TO REALLY TELL THE TRUTH ABOUT HUMAN TRAFFICKING AND THE TRUTH ABOUT HUMAN TRAFFICKING IS THAT IS A VIOLENT CRIME. AND IT IS A SERIOUS CRIME AND IT SHOULD BE REGARDED AS SUCH IN CALIFORNIA THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU MA'AM. THANK YOU MISS- FORMERLY WE NOW HAVE- A DESSA DECIS PERKINS. HELLO I'M HONORED TO BE HERE BEFORE YOU TODAY BUT AS MUCH AS I AM HONORED I AM ALSO EQUALLY SADDENED BECAUSE OF WHY I'M HERE.

I WAS MOLESTED I WAS RAPED AND I WAS SOLD TO THE HIGHEST BIDDER WHICH IS AN ACT OF MODERN DAY SLAVERY FOR YEARS. I WANT TO TELL YOU A STORY BECAUSE I'M ALSO A TEACHER AND THE INTERVENTION COUNSELOR- THE BEGINNING OF THE SCHOOL YEAR. ONE OF MY STUDENTS- I'LL TELL YOU A STORY ABOUT ONE OF MY STUDENTS BECAUSE THIS IS CURRENTLY WHAT'S HAPPENING TO OUR FUTURE LEADERS WHEN SCHOOL STARTED IN AUGUST THIS YOUNG GIRL NICE GREAT DIDN'T HAVE MUCH OF ANYTHING. AND BECAUSE SHE TRUSTED ME YOU SEE I TELL MY STUDENTS ABOUT MY LIFE BECAUSE I WANT THEM TO TRUST ME. FIRST THE FIRST THING SHE DID WAS ASK ME FOR MONEY FOR SOME FEMININE PRODUCTS SOMETHING VERY SIMPLE. THEN SHE ASKED ME FOR A BACKPACK I NOTICED HERS WAS TORN AND SHE WAS TYING PARTS OF IT TOGETHER I TOLD HER I WOULD FIRST SPEAK TO THE ADMINISTRATION BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT TO GET IN TROUBLE FOR BUYING THINGS LIKE THAT FOR STUDENTS. WELL WE ENDED UP GETTING THAT BACKPACK FOR HER ABOUT TWO MONTHS HAVE PASSED AND SHE WAS GONE SHE WAS BACK INTO THE FOSTER SYSTEM. ONE DAY SHE ENDED UP COMING BACK. SHE HAD NICE CLOTHES. SHOES JEWELRY. WHATEVER YOU CAN DO THAT SHE HAD BEEN. WITHIN A MONTH I THEN SAW HER PENDING EXPULSION. I HAD FOUND OUT SHE WAS BEING TRAFFICKED AND SHE WAS CARRYING A LEGAL ITEMS ONTO OUR CAMPUS. I SAY ALL THAT TO SAY THIS THIS COULD BE YOUR DAUGHTER. YOUR SON YOUR NIECE NEPHEW NEIGHBOR'S CHILDREN HUMAN TRAFFICKING DOES NOT. I REPEAT IT DOES NOT DISCRIMINATE. IT DOES NOT CARE HOW MUCH MONEY YOU HAVE. YOUR LOVED ONE COULD BE A VICTIM OF MODERN DAY SLAVERY AS WELL. WHAT THIS BILL ALREADY BE PASSED IF IT WAS YOUR LOVED ONE.

I OVERSEE OUR VICTIM RIGHT AND BIG PICTURE PROGRAM. I FULLY UPHOLD A HAND FORTY TWO WHILE ALL OUR CLIENTS FOR HUMAN TRAFFICKING SURVIVORS OVER 88% HOW OLD OR EXPERIENCED DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. AND OVER 94% OF ALL FOR EXPERIENCED PILOTS BUT ACTUAL VIOLENCE OBVIOUSLY I'M TALKING ABOUT SOME OF THE MOST VULNERABLE PEOPLE IN OUR COMMUNITY. YEAH OVER 90% OF OUR CLIENTS ALSO HAVE A CRIMINAL RECORD. HI THERE TRUST ME MANY OF THEM ACTUALLY TALKING TO TARGET ON THEIR BACK INSTEAD. OF THE PEOPLE WHO TRAFFIC. I WOULD BE ABLE TO ACT DATA SHOW THE BACK MAJORITY OF SEX TRAFFICKING THE WHO ARE OUR FASTEST BY BLACK AND BROWN. FOR OVER A WEEK. AND TO FIGHT FROM A YOUNG AGE. THE THIRD I'M- IF I PERPETRATOR INSTEAD OF BEING PROTECTED FIX THEM AND THEY ARE OFTEN ARRESTED. FOR HUMAN TRAFFICKING RELATED CHARGES. OKAY MY EXPERIENCE WITH OTHER PROPERTIES BEFORE TWENTY FIVE THE PROSECUTOR IN MIAMI FLORIDA BY INVESTIGATORS AND PROSECUTORS THANKS AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING CASES I THOUGHT THE EXACT SAME THING BUT SOME DO NOT SELF IDENTIFY AND LAW ENFORCEMENT FREQUENTLY MET EXEMPLIFIED PERFECT. FROM BOTH. OF YOU AT FOR HUMAN TRAFFICKING VICTIM ON IT QUICKLY. THERE WILL HAVE NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES FOR VICTIMS. ARE I KNOW PEOPLE THAT HE EXISTS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FIVE. WELL LIKE I SAID IF YOU FIND HIM. IN THE LATEST CHARGES. I'M NOT IT ONE WITH THE BEST CASES WATER FORTY. HI RIGHT. YEP WHAT AND- CLOSER TO HUMAN TRAFFIC OKAY HERE YOU HOWEVER A VERY THAT SHE AND THE A. O'MALLEY ABOUT ARE THE ONES WERE GETTING ARRESTED. ADDITIONALLY THE AMOUNT ABOUT RUNNING WITH ONE OF OUR CLIENTS AND MENTION TO YOU ALL THAT SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN ELIGIBLE FOR THE BIG PICTURE AND OTHER PROTECTION BUT THE HONORABLE COMMITTEE HAD WORKED ON IN THE PAST YEAR. BUT IT MADE HIM REALLY I'M SURE IF THIS WILL WORK I. THINK WHAT THE AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE UNDER THE FIFTY TO THIRTY SIX TWENTY THREE AND A BETA TRIAL WASHING. UNDER FIFTY TO THIRTY SIX POINT. ONE OR BOTH. IN FACT YOU IN FACT IT IN WHICH- ANY VIOLENT OR- I'M IT'S BEEN A WONDERFUL BAKING. SO WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH THE PROTECTION THAT WILL POP BY. SHOP LAST YEAR THERE ARE NO X. LAID OUT IN THE L. I AM VERY YOU TO VOTE FOR THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THIS CARD WILL NOW CONTINUE WITH- SECOND LEAD OPPOSITION WITNESS APRIL GRAYSON ARE YOU ON THE LINE. I AM THANK YOU. PLEASE PROCEED MA'AM. GOOD AFTERNOON CANADIAN HERE. MY NAME IS GRACE AND I'M A POLICY ASSOCIATE FOR YOUNG WOMAN AND I ALSO WORK AT ME AGAINST THE FULL HARM ANTI HUMAN TRAFFICKING ORGANIZATION WHERE I AM AND I WOULD LISTEN FOR FIVE BUCKS MY MAIN MOTIVATOR PLAYED ON DIFFERENT ECONOMIC. THE BUT PEOPLE PARTICIPATE. I AM HERE BECAUSE I THANK YOU CAN PUT IT. F. FORTY TWO IF PASSED. WELL I DO ALL THE HARD WORK OF CENTER COME LOCKER AND THE AMERICAN COLLEGE NETWORK FIVE FIVE FIVE EIGHTY ONE FOUR. BUT THE VIRUS I HAVE SIGNED IT THE LAW LAST YEAR. I AM A MEMBER OF THE GASES BUT THE BACK QUALITY. AS WELL AS THE PERSONAL BY ALL TESTIMONY FOR EIGHTY ONE OR LAST YEAR. I THINK BEFORE YOU HAVE TO COME OUT LIKE THE PRIVATE SECTOR HE- WAS NEVER BEEN BACK NIGHT NOT OFFERED ANYTHING. REALLY A SURVIVOR. I WAS OUT FOR THE CPS MA'AM AND ADD THAT EVERY THIS. WAY YOU HAVE TO OFFER. I HAVE NEVER BEEN SEEN AT EIGHTEEN YOU CAN NOT BE ANYBODY THEM. AT NINETEEN I WOULD RATHER LIVE BY THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. I'VE HEARD EVERYTHING YOU. I REPEAT SEVENTEEN YEAR. HAVING A FACTORY THE CARD THAT WOULD BE HUMAN TRAFFICKING TODAY. I DON'T HOME AND READY FOR IT. AND IT. I WOULD NEVER DENIED THE VICTIM OF ME BECAUSE HE- ONLY THE PERPETRATOR EVEN THOUGH I WAS NINETEEN. IN MY TWENTY SEVEN YEAR OLD CODEFENDANT AND- SITTING NEXT TO ME. ALL COURT PRACTICE. HE WASN'T EVEN CONVICTED OF EMBEZZLING CHARGES CRIMINAL THAT IT'S NOT THAT EASILY RECOGNIZES THE- ESPECIALLY YOUNG WOMEN OF COLOR WERE VICTIMS OF SEXUAL EXPLOITATION. WHAT IF THE PASSES I THINK YOU WILL BE REQUIRED TO BECOME THE LEGAL AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE AND BACK THERE THE BIG THEM THE HUMAN FACTOR. THEREFORE THIS BILL WILL NOT ONLY HURT BIG SOMETHING CURRENT OF FIFTY CASES. WILL BE DOUBLED UNDER EFFECT WHILE. ALSO AFFECTED BARLEY OR BARBARA SPEAKING THERE IS A RECORD BREAK AND UNDERTAKER. EVER LIKE ME. THE BILL WOULD HAVE SEVERE COLLATERAL CONSEQUENCES FOR VICTIMS OF THE BARBER. THE SOLUTION IS NOT TO CREATE MORE BURY IT THEM LOOKING AT PROPERLY INVESTIGATE CASES PROVIDING HEALING WE FOR THE PREVENT FURTHER HARM AGAINST SURVIVOR BY THE CRIMINAL LEGAL SYSTEM. UNTIL WE CAN PERFECT THEY COME FROM A RED. NOT PASS LAWS THAT WILL FURTHER HARMED. THEIR AND ULTIMATELY DECIDED. EVEN UNDER CURRENT LAW I AM STILL NOT RECOGNIZED BY THE STATE AT THE HEART OF EVERYTHING. I UNDERSTAND THE- BUT I THOUGHT WE COULD SUCCESSFULLY IDENTIFIED BECAUSE- ALL BECAUSE OF THE COLOR.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR MODERATOR AND WE WOULD ALSO LIKE TO THANK ALL OF OUR SUPPORT IN OPPOSITION WITNESSES WILL NOT BRING THE DISCUSSION BACK TO OUR MEMBERS- SENATOR WIENER. ORDER A COPIOUS NUMBER OF NUMBERS- SO- FIRST OF ALL I JUST WANT TO SAY- AND- WE MET YESTERDAY AND WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU ALSO TO THE TO THE TO THE PERSON WHO CALLED AND EXPRESSED HER EXPERIENCE OBVIOUSLY PEOPLE HAVE DIFFERENT VIEWS OF THE SPELL BUT REGARDLESS WHAT WHAT WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU WHAT HAPPENED TO FAR TOO MANY PEOPLE HERE AND AROUND THE WORLD- IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW WHAT- ABSOLUTELY IS- YOU KNOW THAT IT'S JUST A- IT'S- IT'S A HORRIFIC. ASSISTED A TRAGEDY BUT- A- JUST THE MOST DESTRUCTIVE. DESPICABLE I BECAME A FIND THE RIGHT WORDS. I'M FOR IT THAT PEOPLE ARE BECAUSE I WOULD DO THIS TO OTHER PEOPLE- AND- AND I THINK. WE ALL- AGREE ABOUT THAT IT'S NOT. AN ISSUE AT ALL. WHAT WE'RE DEALING WITH HERE IS AN ISSUE WHAT IS. WHAT WHETHER TO INCREASE. THE CAR SERRATION FOR THIS PARTICULAR CRIME BEYOND THE ALREADY HARSH. CRIMINAL PENALTIES FOR IT AND YOUR RESPECTFULLY TO THE- THE AUTHOR INTO SUPPORTERS- I DON'T AGREE THAT THIS IS THE CORE OF THE PUNISHMENT PENALTIES FOR TRAFFICKING OR LIGHT IN CALIFORNIA IT I TOTALLY RESPECT PEOPLE WANTING TO HAVE A HIGHER PENALTY TOTALLY RESPECT THAT- BUT I DON'T THINK IT'S ACCURATE TO PORTRAY THE CURRENT PENALTIES ARE SOMEHOW BY. MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE VOTERS ADOPT THE CURRENT PENALTIES I BELIEVE IN TWENTY TWELVE WITH PROP THIRTY FIVE MINS ANALYSIS ON YOUR HEAD I'M GLAD I GOT MY NUMBERS RIGHT SO IT WAS THE VOTERS OF CALPURNIA WHO. STARTED THE CURRENT PENALTIES AND THOSE PENALTIES AND PLEASE SOMEONE CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG. OR THAT FOR- FOR NON SEXUAL- FOR FORCED LABOR HUMAN TRAFFICKING- IT'S A MAXIMUM OF UP TO TWELVE YOU. UP PIMPING PANDERING CHILD **** THAT IS PUNISHABLE BY UP TO TWENTY YEARS IN STATE PRISON. IF THE IF THE VICTIM IS A MINOR- AND THERE IS A PROBLEM AND BECAUSE IT'S A COMMERCIAL SEX ACT- INCLUDING PIMPING PANDERING AND CHILD **** THAT'S HUMAN TRAFFICKING PUNISHING PUNISH PUNISHABLE EXCUSE ME BY UP TO TWELVE YEARS AND UP TO LIFE IN PRISON IF THERE'S ANY YOUR POOREST FRAUD DECEIT COERCION VIOLENCE THE REST ETCETERA THAT'S FIFTEEN YEARS- TO LIFE. IN A DAY THEN ON TOP OF THAT BASE SENTENCE OF UP TO TWELVE YEARS UP TO TWENTY YEARS TWELVE YEARS OCT FIFTEEN THE LIFE THERE'S AN ENHANCEMENT OF UP TO TEN METERS ON TOP OF THAT. IF THERE'S BODILY. SO UNDERSTAND THAT THERE'S A MASSIVE SPECTRUM OF THE TYPES OF HARMS OCCUR BECAUSE OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING A LOT OF WHAT WE HEARD TODAY- WITH YOU KNOW I MEAN IT'S JUST HORRIFIC TREATMENT OF HUMAN BEINGS WITH SOME OF THE SEVERE INJURY ACTOR ROB YOU BROKE. AND RAPE AND ETCETERA AND WE HEARD ALL OF THAT. AND THAT THERE'S ALREADY HARSH UNDERLYING PENALTIES PARTICULARLY IF THEIR CHILDREN- IN ADDITION TO THE POSSIBILITY OF A TEN UP TO A FIVE SEVEN OR UP TO TEN YEAR ENHANCEMENT OF GREAT BODILY INJURY. IS INFLICTED ONLY KNOWS DEFINITION OF GREAT BODILY INJURY IS PRETTY BROAD- HI IN ADDITION- MARK ESPECIALLY LIKE IN TERMS OF WHAT WE HEARD SOME OF THE HORRIBLE- DESCRIPTIONS OF CRIMES THAT WE HEARD TODAY- IF HUMAN TRAFFICKING IS ACCOMPANIED BY OTHER. FELONIES THEY THOSE CAN BE PUNISHED SEPARATELY AND SPRINKLE IT WITH CONCURRENT SENTENCES STOCKING THE SENTENCE. AND SOME OF THOSE ARE ARE MANY OF THOSE ARE OUR STRIKES OR SERIOUS VIOLENCE OR KIDNAPPING. FORCIBLE RAPE A RAPE OR SODOMY- LEWD ACTS ON A CHILD- SEXUAL PENETRATION BY MEANS OF FORCE- VARIOUS KINDS OF ASSAULTS- THREATS- AND SO FORTH AND THOSE ARE NOT ONLY FELONIES WITH ADDITIONAL PENALTIES ON TOP OF THAT. BUT THOSE. ARE ALL SERIOUS OR VIOLENT FELONIES AND UNLESS THE STRIKE. WHEN I SAY ALL THIS I KNOW AND I DON'T NOT GOOD DYING TO GET INTO THE DETAILS OF THE SENSING REGION HERE BUT I SAY THIS FOR EVERYONE INCLUDING MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC OR WATCHING TODAY I UNDERSTAND. THAT IS NOT THE CASE THAT COMMITTING THESE EGREGIOUS HORRIFIC OFFENSES AGAINST OTHER HUMAN BEINGS IS SOMEHOW PUNISH LATELY IN CALIFORNIA RIGHT NOW IT'S PUNISHED VERY HARSHLY- INCLUDING BECAUSE OF WHAT THE VOTERS DID IN TWENTY TWELVE- WITH WITH PROPER WITH PROP THIRTY FIVE- SO. YOU SO I UNDERSTAND THE MOTIVATION AND RESPECT THE MOTIVATION BEHIND- THE SPELL- AND THERE'S SO MUCH MORE WE NEED TO DO FOR SURVIVORS IN TERMS OF RESOURCES AND SUPPORT AND I WILL SAY IT WAS A LOT OF REFERENCE TO LGBTQ YOUTH- I WANTED TO TALK ABOUT A MINUTE- YES MY COMMUNITY. YOU KNOW DESERVED IN MY COMMUNITY. PEOPLE WHO. YOU KNOW I WAS A I'LL BE CAN I WAS LUCKY THAT I HAD PARENTS WHO SUPPORTED ME AND LOVED ME. AND LET ME HAVE A ROOF OVER MY HEAD. BECAUSE SO MANY MEMBERS OF MY COMMUNITY. YOU'RE KICKED OUT OF THEIR HOUSES OF OUR HOMES THEIR PARENTS REJECT THEM. BECAUSE THEY COME OUT COULD BE A TWELVE THIRTEEN FOURTEEN YEARS OLD AND THEY ARE ON THE STREET IT'S NOT A COINCIDENCE THAT ALMOST ABOUT HALF. OF HOMELESS YOUTH ARE LGBTQ HALF 50% OF HOMELESS YOUTH ARE LGBTQ THAT'S NOT RANDOM THAT'S BECAUSE THESE CHILDREN ARE GETTING REJECTED FROM THEIR FAMILIES REJECTED FROM THEIR COMMUNITIES AND THEY END UP ON THE STREETS. AND IT IS NOT SHOCKING. THAT SOME OF THEM ARE GETTING TRAFFICKED THEY'RE SO VULNERABLE BECAUSE SOCIETY REJECTS THEM BECAUSE OUR FAMILIES REJECT THEM. AND WE SEE DESPICABLE POLITICIANS. DESPICABLE POLITICIANS PEOPLE LIKE GREG ABBOTT AND RHONDA SANTOS AND ALL THESE PEOPLE. WHO ON THE BACKS. OF LGBTQ KIDS ARE TRYING TO SCORE POLITICAL POINTS TO BECOME PRESIDENT OR SENATOR WHATEVER THEY WANT TO BE. AND WHEN THEY DO THAT MORE OF THESE KIDS END UP ON THE STREETS. AND MORE THESE KIDS END UP TRAFFICKED AND THEY'RE NOT BEING TRAFFICKED BECAUSE THE SENTENCE ISN'T HARSH ENOUGH THEY'RE NOT BEING TRAFFIC BECAUSE IT'S NOT A STRIKE BECAUSE THE PERSON'S ONLY GETTING TWELVE OR TWENTY YEARS. IN PRISON INSTEAD OF LIFE IN PRISON THEY'RE GETTING TRAFFIC BECAUSE WHAT SOCIETY HAS DONE TO THEM. AND I CAN GO THROUGH OTHER COMMUNITIES. BETTER TREATED LIKE GARBAGE IN THE SOCIETY. AND WHEN WE LOOK AT WHO'S GETTING TRAFFICKED IN THIS SOCIETY. DISPROPORTIONATELY IT'S. IT'S NOT PEOPLE WITH MY BACKGROUND. I'M NOT SAYING IT DOESN'T HAPPEN IT DOES CAN HAPPEN TO A LOT OF PEOPLE BUT THERE ARE CERTAIN COMMUNITIES THAT ARE BEING VERY DISPROPORTIONATELY SUBJECTED TO HUMAN TRAFFICKING AND IT'S NOT BECAUSE PEOPLE AREN'T GETTING A STRIKE OR GOING TO PRISON FOR LIFE. IT'S BECAUSE OF THE WAY THAT THIS SOCIETY TREATS CERTAIN COMMUNITIES AND TREATS THE CHILDREN IN THOSE COMMUNITIES AND THEY END UP VULNERABLE ON THE STREET. IN FOSTER CARE DUMPED OUT OF FOSTER CARE AND THEY END UP BEING TRAFFICKED- SO LET'S FOCUS ON SUPPORTING THE SURVIVORS LET'S SUPPORT THESE KIDS BEFORE. THEY END UP IN OPPOSITION. BUT PASSING THIS BILL TODAY IN MY PERSONAL VIEW IS NOT GOING TO CHANGE THIS IS NOT GOING TO HELP. US THOSE SURVIVORS WITH ALL RESPECT AND SO I WON'T BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THIS BILL TODAY. THANK YOU SENATOR WIENER. SENATOR SKINNER. WHICH I CAN CONTINUE. THE FIRST. SINCE YOU'VE BEEN PRESIDING OVER THIS ENTIRE BILL LET YOU KEEP THE MIKE AND- I WAS ABLE TO HEAR SOME OF THE TESTIMONY BUT UNFORTUNATELY I WAS- HAVING TO PRESENT A BUILD ANOTHER COMMITTEE WHICH HAPPENS ON. IN THE JUGGLING OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES AND I WAS ABLE TO MEET- THE KEY WITNESS AT. BOTH WITNESSES AND IN ADVANCE OF THE HEARING. OUR. I IN NO WAY MINIMIZE THE CRIME OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING. IT IS A SERIOUS CRIME. HOWEVER WHEN WE USE THE EXAMPLE OF THAT IF SOMEONE COMMITS A ROBBERY THAT THEY CAN GET A THIRD STRIKE AND IN THIS CASE SOMEONE CAN'T I THINK AS SENATOR WIENER EXPLAINED IT DEPENDS ON THE CIRCUMSTANCE THAT IT IS NOT JUST A FLAT OUT THAT THEY CANNOT- NOW I PERSONALLY DON'T AGREE THAT ROBBERY SHOULD HAVE A THIRD STRIKE I THINK CERTAIN TYPES OF- ROBBERY MAY. BE SHOULD BE ELEVATED BUT NOT ALL AND OUR THIRD STRIKE LAW HAS NOT BENEFITED CALIFORNIANS OR PUBLIC SAFETY. ON. THE OTHER LOOK SENTENCING WE CAN ALWAYS DEBATE WHETHER OUR SENTENCING PRACTICES ARE ADEQUATE BUT- WHEN I LOOK AT THE ANALYSIS AND THERE IS DIFFERENT CATEGORIES OBVIOUSLY THE PERSON COULD BE CHARGED OF ONE OF WHICH WOULD GIVE EIGHT FOURTEEN OR TWENTY YEARS AND OF COURSE IF THEY HAVE ADDITIONAL. CRIMES THAT THEY'RE CHARGED THAT CAN ADD OTHER TIME OR VERY SEVENTIES ALSO KERRY ENHANCEMENTS SO I DON'T THINK IT IS ACCURATE OR FAIR TO DESCRIBE THAT OUR SENTENCING LAWS WOULD ONLY ALLOW FOR A HUMAN TRAFFICKERS TO SERVE SAY TWELVE YEARS. ON. THIS IS EX EXTREMELY EMOTIONAL SUBJECT AND- LEGITIMATELY BECAUSE THOSE WHO ARE TRAFFICKED THEIR LIVES ARE SO TORN APART THE TRAUMA IS. IT MAY NEVER BE ABLE TO BE HEALED FROM. BUT OUR CHANGING CERTAIN PARTS OF THE LAW TO A THIRD STRIKE IS NOT GOING TO ACHIEVE THAT. AND SO I AM UNABLE TO SUPPORT THE BILL IS STRUCTURED TODAY. YES AND THE LAST ONE. WITH OUR DUE RESPECT DON'T MAKE ME CRY HEY. FIRST OF ALL TO SENATOR WIENER'S POINT ABOUT HIS COMMUNITY. I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT- MANY OF US. SEE YOUR CHILDREN NO MATTER WHERE THEY ARE. IN THEIR SEXUAL ORIENTATION AS PRECIOUS. PRECIOUS LITTLE BEANS ESPECIALLY PEOPLE OF FAITH LIKE MY- AND THE FACT THAT MANY OF THEM GO HOMELESS OR KICKED OUT OF THEIR HOME IS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY I SUPPORT EVERYTHING THAT I CAN FOR FOSTER YOUTH. AND KIDS I DON'T THINK ANY CHILD SHOULD BE KICKED OUT OF THEIR HOME. AND AS A MATTER OF FACT WHEN I LEARNED ABOUT HUMAN TRAFFICKING R. SEVERAL YEARS BACK AND BECAME AWARE THANKS TO DR OPAL SINGLETON AND THE RESEARCH AND THE WORK THAT SHE HAS DONE IN THIS FIELD. I ACTUALLY WENT BACK HOME AND I SHARED IT WITH MY KIDS AT THE TIME I HAD A THIRTEEN YEAR OLD. DAUGHTER AND- SHARE WITH HER HEALTH PEOPLE ARE GROOMED AND- RIDE INTO THIS SPACE. AND MY THIRTEEN YEAR OLD SAID MOM. WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT THIS WE SHOULD ALL LEARN HIS THEY NEED TO TELL EVERYBODY SHE BECAME DESPERATE. FOR HER FRIENDS AND SCHOOLMATES TO LEARN ABOUT IT. AS THE FIERCE MAMA BEAR. EVERY HILD PRECIOUS AND PROTECTED. WHEN IT COMES TO THIS BILL. I WANT TO ADDRESS THE FACT THAT I UNDERSTAND HIS ONCE AGAIN I WISH I HAD MORE DEPTH. BUT ONE THING IS CLEAR. LET YOU FOLKS HAVE EXPRESSED THE FACT THAT THEY ARE. OTHER CRIMES THAT ARE CONSIDERED SERIOUS FELONIES YOU EXPLAIN THAT TODAY EARLIER IN YOUR TESTIMONY. IT ALSO EXPRESSED THE EIGHT FOURTEEN AND TWENTY YEARS BUT ONE THING THAT FACT THAT. THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE SENTENCED BUT FOR X. Y. NZ REASONS ARE RELEASED. AND GO BACK AND COMMIT THE CRIME AGAIN AGAIN AND I THINK THAT IS WHY WE HAVE. HELLO THERE IS AN INTENT OR IT BASICALLY AN INTENT OR DESIRE TO MAKE THIS A THREE STRIKES ARE PART OF THE THREE STRIKES- COMPONENT OR ELEMENT IS BECAUSE WE WANT TO CURB. THOSE THAT ARE PERPETRATORS CONTINUES PERPETRATORS FROM BEING ABLE TO USE THE SYSTEM. AND BASICALLY INFLICT HARM ON CHILDREN FULL OF COLOR WOMEN AND EVEN MEN. I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE GIVEN OPPORTUNITY- TO ADDRESS SOME OF THESE QUESTIONS BECAUSE I'M NOT AN EXPERT AND I'M JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND BUT I WOULD LOVE TO GIVE OUR DISTRICT ATTORNEY O'MALLEY AN OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT WERE EXPRESSED. RESERVATIONS THAT- THE CRIMINAL ATTACH- CRIMINAL LAW SUPERVISING ATTORNEY MS CLARK. STATED AND- THE A POLICY ASSOCIATE YOUNG WOMEN'S FREEDOM CENTER- MISS GRACE AND EXPRESSED. WOULD YOU MIND ADDRESSING SOME OF THE ISSUES WITH REGARD TO WHETHER OR NOT. THEY ARE SEEN THE VICTIMS ARE SEEN AND WHETHER OR NOT THEY'RE PROTECTED IF THEY ARE ARRESTED- IN THIS SPACE. WHEN SOME OF THE FIRST OF ALL I JUST WANNA THIS IS BEEN VERY VERY EMOTIONAL BECAUSE OF EVERYTHING HAS BEEN EXPRESSED BY THE THREE SENATORS BY SENATOR BREAUX SENATOR CAFIERO SO- AND ALL THE SPEAKERS. WHAT WHAT WE HAVE CHANGED SO MUCH OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS WHEN I STARTED IN THIS AS I SAID IN NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN. THERE WAS NOTHING. OTHER THAN FOR SOMEONE WHO IS UNDER FOURTEEN AND WE COULD TREAT IT LIKE CHILD MOLEST. WE HAVE LEARNED SO MUCH WE HAVE DONE SO MUCH BUT ONE OF THE THINGS WE HAVE LEARNED. IS THAT FIRST OF ALL THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE VICTIMIZED. WHO THEN CAN FIND THEMSELVES INVOLVED IN CRIMINAL ACTIVITY. PART OF WHAT OUR LAW DOES NOW IS IT. NOT JUST ALLOWS PEOPLE LIKE ME AND OTHER PROSECUTORS LAW ENFORCEMENT TO LOOK AT PEOPLE'S BACKGROUND. AND MOTIVATION AND PARTICULARLY THEIR VICTIMIZATION THAT PUT THEM IN A PATH OF. BEING EITHER EIGHT USED BY A TRAFFICKER TO COMMIT CRIMES OR TO. FOR THEIR LIFE SAVING TO ENGAGE AND SOMETHING LIKE A RECRUITING OR SOMETHING. I THINK THAT. WE ARE VERY COGNIZANT OF THE IMPACT OF TRAFFICKING WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS ALL DAY WHERE THEY WOULDN'T OTHERWISE DO IT. BUT WE DO HAVE LAWS WE DO HAVE THERE'S A LEGAL DEFENSE IF SOMEBODY IS ACCUSED OF A CRIME A pBE USED AT TRIAL DEPENDING ON THE CRIME. WELL IT IT'S AVAILABLE- AND THAT'S THAT BECOME SOMETHING FOR A JURY TO DECIDE SO I THINK IT ALSO DEPENDS ON THE MAGNITUDE OF WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. IN MY COUNTY AND MANY COUNTIES THAT HAVE BROUGHT FORTH HUMAN TRAFFICKING EXPERTS TO SIT IN THE CHAIR THAT I SIT IN. THAT ONE OF THE THINGS WE ARE LOOKING AT IS WHAT IS THE WHAT HOW IS IT THAT A PERSON WHO WAS ONCE TRAFFIC OR IS ENGAGING IN SOME CRIMINAL BEHAVIOR WHAT IS THE ROOT OF THAT. THE SAME ANALYSIS WERE DOING FOR VICTIMS WE'RE DOING FOR PEOPLE WHO GET CAUGHT UP IN CRIME. AND IF IN FACT THE ROOT OF THEIR CONDUCT. IS BECAUSE THEY WERE TRAFFICKED AND THEIR PSYCHOLOGICAL RESPONSE AND IMPACT OF THAT TRAFFICKING EXPERIENCE NOW PUTS THEM IN A DIFFERENT POSITION. THAN THAT IS TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION FOR PEOPLE THAT UNDERSTAND AND- MATT AND HANDLE CASES INVOLVING HUMAN TRAFFICKING BUT IF SOMEBODY WAS CONVICTED. THERE ARE VACANT YOUR LAWS WHICH WE HEARD ABOUT FROM A MEMBER OF THE OPPOSITION. WE'RE VERY ACTIVE ACROSS THE STATE THERE ARE VACANT YOUR LAWS THERE ARE ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE BRINGING THESE CASES TO OUR ATTENTION. WE OURSELVES IN PROSECUTORS OFFICES ARE LOOKING AT COLD CASES TO SEE WHETHER OR NOT. THE CRIME WAS COMMITTED WHILE SOMEONE IS BEING TRAFFICKED OR AS A RESULT OF BEING TRAFFICKED. THERE ARE THERE'S RE SENTENCING LAWS THAT YOUR LEGISLATURE HAS CREATED THAT HAS ALLOWED US. MEANING PROSECUTORS AND TO GO BACK AND PULL CASES BACK INTO THE COURT TO SAY THIS SENTENCE IS NOT WARRANTED WAS NOT WARRANTED WE CAN RE SENTENCE PEOPLE. AND THEN LASTLY BUT YOU KNOW WE WHEN THEY'RE WHEN THEY'RE CHALLENGES THERE ALSO THE COMMUTATION LAWS THAT HAVE BECOME. MUCH MORE AVAILABLE TO PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN CONVICTED OF CRIMES THROUGH GOVERNOR IS BEEN. VERY RESPONSIVE. TO HEARING AND READING ABOUT SOMEBODY'S BACKGROUND THAT LED TO CONVICTION SO. I WOULD SAY THAT PART OF IT IS BRINGING IT FOR BRINGING THESE OLD CONVICTIONS IN THESE OLD CIRCUMSTANCES FORD AND THE LAW HAS GIVEN US YOUR- TO YOUR CREATION. THE LAW HAS GIVEN US SEVERAL VEHICLES FOR. BEING ABLE TO SET ASIDE CONVICTIONS OR BEING ABLE TO RESEND SOME SOMEONE IF THEY'RE STILL INCARCERATED AND BRING THEM BACK. THERE ARE JUST SO MANY AREAS AND PARTICULARLY ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT ARE THE VACANT YOUR LAWS FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE CONVICTED OF CRIMES. WHEN IT'S DETERMINED THAT WHEN THEY COMMITTED THAT CRIME THEY WERE VICTIMS OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING. THAT'S THE BASIS OF THE BAKER LAWS FOR THOSE THAT HAVE BEEN TRAFFICKED. I HOPE THAT ANSWERS YOUR QUESTION IT SAYS IT DOES. AND THEN LASTLY THERE WAS ANOTHER. UP FOR THE RECORD WOULD YOU MIND- BECAUSE I KNOW ARE MY COLLEAGUES ARE VERY VERY FOCUSED ON RESEARCH AND DATA- IN ORDER TO SUPPORT POLICY COULD YOU EXPLAIN THE RESEARCH IN THE DATA THAT YOU ARE COMING ACROSS WITH REGARDS TO NOT NECESSARY THAT PART- THE VICTIMS WHO HAD BEEN- COMPELLED TO COME INTO THIS INTO THIS HUMAN TRAFFICKING SPACE BUT MORE SO THROUGH THE PERPETRATORS AND SPECIALLY WITH REGARDS TO. THOSE WHO ARE REPEAT OFFENDERS THAT CONTINUOUSLY COME BACK AND- COMMIT THIS CRIME. WELL THERE IS A LOT OF RESEARCH. AND MORE EMERGING RESEARCH IN THIS PARTICULAR AREA TRYING TO FIGURE OUT THE PSYCHOLOGY OF A PERSON WHO'S A HUMAN TRAFFICKER SO THAT IS DIFFERENT IN THAT WHEN WE FIRST STARTED SEEING HUMAN TRAFFICKING EMERGING WE ARE SEEING- PEOPLE THAT WERE SWITCHING FROM SELLING DRUGS TO SELLING PEOPLE. YOU KNOW IT WASN'T THE SAME MENTALITY BUT WHAT WE DO AND THE RESEARCH IS NOT SHOWING US IS THAT THERE'S A HIGH PERCENTAGE OF PSYCHOPATHY IN INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE HUMAN TRAFFICKERS THE ONES WHO ARE HAVE NO HUMAN EMOTION AND REGARDS TO THE INDIVIDUAL THEY'RE THEY'RE SELLING. THE ONE WHO IS USING VIOLENCE SOMETIMES TO FORCE THEM TO DO TO ENGAGE IN THAT SEXUAL ACTIVITY SO THERE'S A HIGH DEGREE OF PSYCHOPATHY AND THAT IS A VERY INTERESTING. FROM A PSYCHOLOGICAL STANDPOINT BECAUSE THE PERCENTAGE OF INDIVIDUALS IN OUR SOCIETY ACCORDING TO RESEARCH OF PEOPLE WHO ARE TRUE PSYCHO PASS OR HAVE. THAT PSYCHOPATHY IS PRETTY SMALL BUT IN THE WORLD OF HUMAN TRAFFICKERS AT LEAST WITH THE RESEARCH IS STARTING TO SHOW US IN THE WORLD OF HUMAN TRAFFICKERS THAT. PERCENTAGE OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE CYCLE PASTOR HAVE PSYCHOPATHY AS PART OF THEIR MAKE UP IS HIGH. AND THAT IS VERY SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE IF A PERSON'S WIRING IF YOU WILL MENTAL WIRING IS SUCH THAT THEY DON'T HAVE HUMAN EMPATHY AND THEY DON'T. THEY DON'T HAVE THAT KIND OF CARING THAT WE ARE ALL EXPRESSING HERE- THEN. THERE'S NO- THERE'S NO INCENTIVE OR THERE'S NO SOCIAL OF PRESSURE TO ACT DIFFERENTLY. WHAT THE RESEARCH IS ALSO SHOWING US IS THAT FOR HUMAN TRAFFICKERS. AND THESE ARE ADULTS HUMAN TRAFFICKERS AND I'M FOLK THAT WE FOCUS ON THAT THERE'S A PREDATORY NATURE OF THE CRIME THERE THE RESEARCH SAYS THAT THEY'RE LOOKING FOR SOMEBODY TO LOWER INTO A TRAFFICKING. OR INTO MODERN DAY SO CAN YOU MAKE THAT SPECIFIC TO THE I THINK THE DATA THIS IS RESEARCH BUT HOW DOES THAT RELATE TO THE- THE QUESTION OF THERE. THE SENTENCING AND THE REPEAT OFFENSE THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DESCRIBE IS THEIR DATA THAT SHOWS THAT. WELL THERE'S NOT DATE IN TERMS OF SENTENCING BUT THEIR STATE IN TERMS OF THE MAKE UP OF AN INDIVIDUAL RIGHT SO. BUT SO BASICALLY WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT RIGHT NOW IS HOW WOULD THAT DATA JUSTIFY. ON THE NEED FOR- THREE STRIKES ARE HAVING HUMAN TRAFFICKING BE PART AS A SEARS AND FELONY. TO BE CHARGED AS A THREE STRIKES I THINK THAT'S OR YES SO THANK YOU I'M I APOLOGIZE I WASN'T SO FOCUSED ON THAT. THE THREE STRIKES LAW. ANALYSTS SAY A STRIKE I MEAN A STRIKE IF YOU WILL. I IS IT REALLY FOCUSED ON PEOPLE WHO ARE REPEAT OFFENDERS. SO IF SOMEBODY COMMITS A STRIKE CRIMEI WON'T USE ROBBERY BECAUSE I AGREE ON SOME LEVEL WITH SENATOR SKINNER. BUT AND IT'S A SERIOUS VIOLENT FELONY. AND THEY ARE INCARCERATED AND THEY COME OUT AND THEY NEVER COMMIT ANOTHER CRIME. THEN THE THREE STRIKES LAW REALLY DOESN'T IMPACT THEM DIRECTLY IN TERMS OF CAUSING A GREATER SENTENCE IT IS THE SENTENCE THAT THE PENAL CODE. ALLOCATE WHERE WHERE I BELIEVE THIS RESEARCH WILL LEAD US TO IS THAT SOMEBODY WHO HAS HAS SITE HAS THE PSYCHOPATHY AND SOMEBODY WHO. DOESN'T HAVE OR IS A PREDATOR IN THERE AS THEIR NATURE OR HAS DISREGARD FOR THE IMPACT OF THE CRIME THERE'S NO PSYCHOLOGICAL INCENTIVE NOT TO CONTINUE THAT BEHAVIOR. SO THREE STRIKES IS REALLY ABOUT. CAN CONTINUE TO COMMIT CRIMES AFTER YOU'VE BEEN COMMITTED CONVICTED OF A CRIME AND- THE RESEARCH IS NOT SO SPECIFIC TO SAY HOW DOES THIS PSYCHOPATHY. FIT INTO SENTENCING BUT I WOULD ARGUE THAT THE IF SOMEBODY IS A PREDATOR AND THEY AREN'T BOUND BY THE RULES OF SOCIETY AND THEY HAVE A HIGH DEGREE OF PSYCHOPATHY AND PREDATORY NATURE THAT THERE'S- NOTHING TO STOP THEM ONCE THEY'RE BACK OUT IN THE FREE SOCIETY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR MALLEY- TO OUR MEMBERS HAVE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. IN THIS CASE I DON'T KNOW. THANK YOU S. SINNERS SCANNER WE- AT CENTER GROVE WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE YES MA'AM THANK YOU. M. I WANT TO ADDRESS A MISS GRAYSON AT FIRST AS A REBUTTAL WITH ALL DUE RESPECT BECAUSE OF WHAT SHE WENT THROUGH IN HER STORY IN THE OPPOSITION. I WANT TO BE CLEAR TO MISS GRACE AND THAT SHE MATTERS. AND I WAS GOING TO BE CLEAR TO MISCREANTS AND THAT THIS BILL TEN FORTY TWO DOES NOT AFFECT PIMPING AND PANDERING OR DRESS PIMPING AND PANDERING AT ALL. IN ANY WAY SHAPE OR FORM. TEN FORTY TWO ONLY APPLIES TO SECTION CODE TO THIRTY SIX POINT ONE WHICH- WHICH A MYSTERY SCENE REPRESENTED AS THE PROSTITUTION OR SEX WORK REFERENCED IN SIX FORTY SEVEN WHICH THIS BILL DOES NOT TOUCH. SO FOR YEARS BEFORE THAT BALLOT MEASURE WAS PASSED INDIVIDUALS LIKE MISS GRACE AND WERE ARRESTED AND NOT TREATED AS VICTIMS. AND NOW THEY ARE THAT MR GRAYSON WAS SENTENCED PRIOR TO THAT AND THAT'S MY UNDERSTANDING. SO I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT EVEN CURRENTLY MOVING FORWARD WITH TEN FORTY TWO THIS IS NOT A DRESS PIMPING AND PANDERING. I ALSO WANTED TO ADDRESS MY COLLEAGUE FROM OAKLAND. AND SAY I DEEPLY RESPECT YOU BOTH OF YOU YOU'RE ALWAYS ON THE LISTEN TALK THINGS OUT WE DON'T AGREE. A LOT. BUT THERE IS A GENUINE KINDNESS AND DEFENSE FOR HOW YOU THINK ANY RESPECT HELLO I THINK. ON ISSUES THIS IS ESPECIALLY DIFFICULT ONES LIKE THIS AND I DON'T MEAN TO. IT'S JUST THIS IS A VERY HARD SUBJECT MATTER. AND TO MY COLLEAGUE TO BERKELEY WITH ALL DUE RESPECT IT'S NOT ALWAYS ABOUT REFORM. IT'S NOT ALWAYS ABOUT SOMEBODY COMING OUT OF THE PRISON SYSTEM TO BE A BETTER PERSON NOW WE HAVE PEOPLE IN THIS BUILDING THAT HAVE DONE THAT COME AT THE PRISON SYSTEM IN GAME THREE EMPLOYED- DO THE RIGHT THINGS. BUT SOMETIMES IT'S NOT ALWAYS ABOUT REFORM IT'S ABOUT JUSTICE AND TO BE FRANK IT'S ABOUT PUNISHMENT. PUNISHMENT FOR WHAT PEOPLE DO TO OTHER HUMAN BEINGS. ADD TO MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN FRANCISCO AGAIN DEEP RESPECT YOU WERE ALWAYS SO KIND TO ME EVERY TIME I COME TO YOU AND- HAVE ISSUES OR A BILL. AND THE COMMUNITY THAT YOU REPRESENT. THEM WHEN YOU SAID MY COMMUNITY. MY HEART BREAKS FOR THAT COMMUNITY BECAUSE RESEARCHING THE SPILL YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. THERE ARE MORE VICIOUS CRIMES PERPETRATED AGAINST TRANSGENDER AND L. G. B. T. Q. INDIVIDUALS IN THE HUMAN TRAFFICKING SPACE. THE ANY OTHER. F. ANY OTHER SECTOR. AND THERE WAS A WITNESS THAT TESTIFIED ABOUT HOW THIS HURTS BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITIES THE BILL DOES IT HURT BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITIES IT'S EVIDENCE IN STUDIES THAT WERE BROUGHT FORTH BY THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT DOWN IN THAT AREA. THAT OVER 50% OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE TRAFFICKED SEX TRAFFICKED ARE BLACK AND BROWN. MY WITNESS. FROM KERN COUNTY IS BLACK AND SHE STOOD BEFORE ALL OF YOU YESTERDAY MAYBE NOT MISS SKINNER BECAUSE SHE WAS VERY VERY NERVOUS ABOUT MEETING A SENATOR SLAVERY DAYS THEY STOOD ON THE AUCTION BLOCK. NAKED AS PEOPLE WALKED BY AND THEY WERE SOLD TO THE HIGHEST BIDDER. AT TODAY THAT'S JUST THE LOCATION CHANGE THEY'RE STILL. GRADED OUT ON THE STREETS OR IN THIS CASE A HOTEL ROOM NAKED AND SOLD TO THE HIGHEST BIDDER. THIS IS A VERY- EMOTIONAL AND EMOTIONALLY CHARGED SUBJECT MATTER. WHEN I ASKED MY STAFF TO PUT TOGETHER. A A LIST OF THINGS WERE NOT CONSIDERED SERIOUS AND VIOLENT IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I WAS ACTUALLY THINKING OF SMASH AND GRABS. CARRYING A PICKAXE IN WALGREENS BECAUSE NEVER EVER IN A MILLION YEARS DID I EVER THINK THAT HUMAN TRAFFICKING THE BUYING AND SELLING OF A HUMAN BEING WAS NOT CONSIDERED SERIOUS OR VIOLENT. THE MIUTE LAB READ A LITTLE BIT ON DISTRICT GOVERNMENT ATTORNEY O'MALLEY'S COMMENTS BECAUSE- M. AS JUST A RESPONSE TO YOUR QUESTIONS. TO MAKE THIS A SERIOUS AND VIOLENT FELONY IN A STRIKING AGAIN I'M NO LEGAL EXPERT. BUT IT DOESN'T AFFECT THE FIRST SENTENCE TWELVE YEARS. THIRTEEN YEARS BUT IF THEY GET OUT IF THEY GO TO PRISON HAND THEY GET PICTURES OFF FOR GOOD BEHAVIOR IN A TIME AND DAY SERVED IN ALL THE THINGS THAT WE ALLOW. AND THEY GET BACK OUT ON THE STREET AND THEY RE OFFEND. AS A TRAFFICKER. IF THIS BILL WAS TO PASS. THEY COULD HAVE A STRIKE AND THEY WOULD HAVE ENHANCED SEVERE. PUNISHMENT PENALTIES. AND I KNOW I JUST MY COLLEAGUE AND I FROM SAN FRANCISCO DEEPLY I DEEPLY RESPECT BUT WE DO DISAGREE BECAUSE I DO BELIEVE THAT SOME THINGS. SHOULD BE ABOUT PUNISHMENT. SO IN CLOSING I'D LIKE TO THINK OF. MY DISTRICT ATTORNEY CYNTHIA ZIMMER TO HAVE THE COURAGE TO BRING THIS FOURTH. AND N. B. THAT THE SPONSOR OF THIS BILL I WANT TO THANK VERY LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY IN THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE SURVIVAL ORGANIZATIONS NONPROFITS. AND PEOPLE THAT TESTIFIED ON THE PHONE FROM ALL OVER THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. TO SUPPORT THIS BILL TO BRING JUSTICE TO THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN VIOLENTLY. I AM ASSAULTED. I WILL ALSO TELL YOU THAT THE DEFINITION OF SLAVERY IS A CONDITION OF A HUMAN BEING BEING OWNED BY ANOTHER SLAVE WAS CONSIDERED LAW AS PROPERTY OR CHATTEL AND WAS DEPRIVED OF MOST OF THE RIGHTS ORDINARILY HELD BY FREE PERSONS HUMAN TRAFFICKING LIKE MY CONSTITUENT ODESSA PERKINS SAID YESTERDAY. IS MODERN DAY SLAVERY AND SHE IS HERE ALONG WITH OTHER WITNESSES THAT TESTIFIED. ON BEHALF OF MILLIONS OF VICTIMS THAT THIS IS MODERN DAY SLAVERY. TRAFFICKED VICTIMS ARE OWNED BY OTHER PEOPLE THEY ARE DEPRIVED OF MOST OF THE RIGHTS HELD BY OTHERS THEY ARE CONSIDERED PROPERTY SOME ARE EVEN TATTOOED FOR BRANDED TO PROVE OWNERSHIP. THEY'RE A SLAVE TO SEX OR LABOR TRAFFICKERS. A VOTE TODAY TO NOT SUPPORT THIS BILL WILL BE SENDING A MESSAGE I BELIEVE TO THE CURRENT VICTIMS AND SURVIVORS OF THIS GROTESQUE CRIME BUT ESPECIALLY THE TRAFFICKERS THEMSELVES THAT THEY DON'T NEED TO TAKE THIS CRIME SERIOUS AND IT'S NOT SERIOUS ENOUGH TO BE CONSIDERED A STRIKE I THINK YOU'RE SAYING THAT YOUR- YOU'RE SUPPORTING NOT SUPPORTING THAT. YOU AGREE THAT SELLING A HUMAN BEING IS NOT A SERIOUS VIOLENT FELONY. I URGE YOU TO LISTEN TO THE EXPERTS IN THIS FIELD AND I REALIZE THEY'RE EXPERTS ON BOTH SIDES OF THIS ISSUE. BUT I THINK THE ANALYSIS HAD A LOT OF ERRORS IN IT. AND I THINK THE PEOPLE ON THE GROUND THAT PROSECUTE THESE CRIMES THAT NEED THE TOOLS IN THEIR TOOLBOX TO MAKE SURE. THAT THE INDIVIDUALS WHO PERPETRATE THESE CRIMES LIKE THE MOTHER WHO TESTIFIED REAL BRIEFLY. IN THE ME TOO SECTION. AS SHE TESTIFIED AT THE PRESS CONFERENCE TODAY N. M. ONE OF THE INDIVIDUALS GOT OUT JUST AFTER A FEW MONTHS. SHE WATCHED HER DAUGHTER GET RATE SHE WATCHED HER DAUGHTER GET BEATEN. AND THERE'S GOTTA BE HARSHER PENALTIES FOR PEOPLE WHO WOULD BE WILLING TO PERPETRATE THAT AGAINST ANOTHER HUMAN BEING EVERYBODY THAT CALLED IN ON THE PHONE WE ONLY NEED THREE VOTES. WE HAVE A JOINT DEMOCRAT. AUTHOR IN WE HAVE THIRTEEN DEMOCRAT CO AUTHORS SO THIS IS TRULY A BIPARTISAN BILL. AND WE NEED THREE VOTES TO CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION TO MAKE ADJUSTMENTS TO THIS BILL WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE SO THAT WE CAN MAKE SURE OUR TRAFFICKED VICTIMS AND SURVIVORS ARE TAKING CARE OF. BUT THERE IS ALSO A JUST PUNISHMENT FOR THE CRIMES THAT THE COMMIT I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR I. BOAT. THE BILL. SENATOR OCHO IT GAVE ME BACK THE GAVEL SO THAT SHE COULD MOVE THE BILL GROVE THIS IS THE MOST DIFFICULT COMMITTEE TO SERVE ON. THE THINGS THAT COME BEFORE US. THE EXPERIENCES OF VICTIMS AND THIS ONE OF THIS PARTICULAR CRIME THE EXPERIENCES OF VICTIMS. I MEAN I DON'T WANT TO PUT. AND WHEN WE TALK FOR EXAMPLE. AROUND RAPE SITUATIONS AND JUST FIFTY A. O'MALLEY IS BROUGHT MANY BILLS WHERE WE TRIED TO FIX WHERE WE HAD WE'VE HAD YEARS WHERE. PROSECUTORS AND OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT WOULD NOT TREAT RAPE SERIOUSLY WE HAD REVENUE FOR YEARS JUST IGNORED AND SIT ON SHELVES. AND IF I DON'T NEED TO GO INTO GREAT DETAIL BUT THE TYPES OF. STORIES EXPERIENCES I DON'T WANT TO MINIMIZE THE STORIES BUT THE PERSONAL EXPERIENCES OF PEOPLE THAT COME TO THIS COMMITTEE EITHER THAT THERE THEY WERE THEMSELVES THE VICTIM OF A HORRIFIC CRIME OR THEY HAD A CHILD OR A MURDER RAPE HUMAN TRAFFICKING YOUR NAME IS IT IS THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST EMOTIONALLY TOILING COMMIT. AND OUR LAWS ARE NOT PERFECT BY ANY MEANS. AND THERE ARE CERTAINLY PERHAPS WE SHOULD HAVE A WHOLE DIFFERENT SYSTEM OF EVALUATING A CRIMINAL ON THE ON THE FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF THEIR- IF THEY ARE SOCIAL PATH. AND- WHAT. WE WOULD PROBABLY FIND THERE'S A NUMBER OF CATEGORIES OF CRIMES THAT PROBABLY ATTRACT SOCIOPATHS MORE THAN OTHERS. AND YET WE DON'T HAVE A SENSING SYSTEM THAT TRIES TO IDENTIFY THAT. SO WE ARE TRYING NOW TO DEVELOPERS WE ARE TRYING NOW TO DEAL WITH THE CREW- THE EXISTING SENSING SYSTEM WITH THE TOOLS THAT ARE BEFORE US. AND CLEARLY YOU HAVE MADE A VERY- VERY PASSIONATE ARTICULATE. AND ONE. SOMETHING THAT MANY PEOPLE COULD SUPPORT AS TO WHY WE SHOULD MAKE THIS CHANGE. AS YOU HEARD IN I DO NOT NEED TO SAY THIS IN ANY WAY TO RUB IT IN FOR ANYONE WHO IS NOT GOING TO APPRECIATE THAT THIS BILL MAY NOT. BE SUPPORTED TODAY BIT MORE. LAWS ON THE BOOKS THAT CAN BE USED AGAINST THESE PERPETRATORS. AND WE HAVE TO IN THIS COMMITTEE WAY THE FULL AMOUNT OF. OF TOOLS THAT A PROSECUTOR HAS EVEN WON THE PROSECUTORS DON'T FEEL THEY'RE ADEQUATE OR INDIVIDUAL PROSECUTORS DON'T END THERE OF COURSE ENTITLED TO THAT AND THAT'S WHAT OUR ANALYSIS THAT'S WHAT OUR KID STAFF IN THE COMMITTEE ARE TRYING TO DO WHEN THEY PROVIDE THAT ANALYSIS TO US AND OF COURSE YOU KNOW I'VE HAD TIMES WHERE BILLS OF MINE I DIDN'T AGREE WITH ANALYSIS THREAT. THAT ALWAYS CAN BE DEBATED. BUT I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT. HOWEVER ANY OF US BOTH TODAY IT IS NOT BECAUSE THE- WHAT WAS PRESENTED TO US WAS NOT COMPELLING FOR. YOU POWERFUL IT WAS THAT WE ARE WE ARE LOOKING AT THE FACTS AND MAKING CONCUSIONS IN. IN DIFFERENT WAYS SO WITH THAT WE WILL TAKE A VOTE WE HAVE A MOTION. ON THE VOTE THE MOTION WOULD BE TO PASS AND SEND TO- TO GO TO A POPE'S APPROPRIATIONS PHYLLIS SEVERAL CALLS ABOUT. S. B. TEN FORTY THE PASTOR APPROPRIATIONS SCANNER NOT VOTING SCANNER NOT VOTING TROUBLED I TROUBLE GUY COM LONGER WINNER. WINNER NOW. WE CAN IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO REQUEST A RECONSIDERATION WE CAN GRANT THAT. A PETITION FOR RECONSIDERATION THANK YOU FOR REMINDING ME THEN WE WILL GRANT RECONSIDERATION THANK YOU MA'AM YOU'RE WELCOME. YES I'VE BEEN HERE THE WHOLE. ALL. OKAY THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. OBVIOUSLY THIS BILL BE MUCH MUCH EASIER TO PRESENT THEY LISTEN TO AND- AND I THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME- MADAM CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS I RISE TODAY TO PRESENT SENATE BILL ELEVEN THIRTY THREE WHICH CLARIFIES EXISTING LAW FOR WHEN A STATE OF EMERGENCY IS DECLARED TO ENSURE BETTER COMPLIANCE AND PROTECTIONS FOR CONSUMERS IN THE MARKET PLACE. THE ANTI PRICING GOUGING LAW THAT IS TRIGGERED AFTER A STATE OF EMERGENCY DECLARED PROHIBITS MANY INDUSTRIES FROM INCREASING PRICES MORE THAN 10% THE PENALTY FOR VIOLATING THIS LAW INCLUDE FINES AND JAIL TIME DUE TO PENAL CODE SECTION THREE NINETY SIX SECTION THREE NINETY SIX WAS SIGNED INTO LAW IN NINETEEN NINETY FOUR TO PROTECT CITIZENS FROM EXCESSIVE AND UNJUSTIFIED INCREASES IN PRICES CHARGED FOR GOODS AND SERVICES. THAT ARE VITAL AND NECESSARY FOR THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF CONSUMERS RESULTING FROM ABNORMAL DIS DISRUPTIONS OF THE MARKET. ALTHOUGH THE PRICE GOUGING LIMITATIONS WAS ONLY INTENDED TO APPLY FOR THIRTY DAYS STATE AND LOCAL OFFICIALS HAVE EXTENDED NUMEROUS STATE OF EMERGENCIES FOR MONTHS EVEN YEARS THERE BY- MAKING THE CORRECT THIRTY DAY PERIOD. UNKNOWN TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS SOME EMERGENCY DUE TO CORPORATE NINETEEN AND WILDFIRES AND DROUGHTS HAVE YET TO BE ENDED. UNFORTUNATELY THESE EXTENSIONS ARE NOT ALWAYS MADE PUBLIC BY STATE AND LOCAL OFFICIALS WHICH LEAVES BUSINESSES CONFUSED ON HOW TO PROPERLY COMPLY WITH EXISTING LAW. SENATE BILL ELEVEN THIRTY THREE FIXES THIS PROBLEM BY REQUIRING THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THE CALIFORNIA OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES TO KEEP AN UPDATE UP TO DATE WEBSITE REGARDING ALL DECLARED EMERGENCY PROCLAMATIONS AT THIS POINT I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE CHAIRMAN THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR WORKING WITH ME ON SENATE BILL ELEVEN THIRTY THREE IN FACT I HAVE THE AUTHOR AMENDMENTS BUT I WILL BE TAKING IF APPROVED BY THE CHAIR. ADDRESSES ALL THE ISSUES RAISED IN THE ANALYSIS. OF THE MEMBERS TO- WHAT DO THE FOLLOWING REQUIRE SPECIFIC FINDINGS RELATED TO HOUSING IN ORDER TO CONTINUE THE STATE OF EMERGENCY THAT EXISTS BEYOND ONE YEAR. DELETE THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND RENT CONTROL HOUSING EXEMPTIONS FROM THE BILL THESE ARE MOMENTS AND BEEN TAKEN AND SET A PRICE GOUGING CAP OF 10% PER YEAR HOWEVER UPON FURTHER NEGOTIATIONS WITH COMMITTEE MEMBERS I AM PREPARED TO CUT THIS- PIECE RIGHT OUT OF THE BILL AS WELL. HAVING SAID ALL THIS AS PROPOSED TO BE AMENDED THIS BILL WILL REQUIRE THE CALIFORNIA OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES TO KEEP AN UP TO DATE WEBSITE AND ONLY REQUIRE FINANCE RELATED TO HOUSING TO CONTINUE A STATE OF EMERGENCY THAT EXTENDS BEYOND ONE YEAR. AS AMENDED THIS BILL WILL STRIKE A BALANCE BETWEEN PROTECTING OUR CONSTITUENTS- DEVASTATED BY EMERGENCIES WHILE ALSO CONSIDERING THE IMPACTS WERE RENTAL UNIT OWNERS HOMEOWNERS WHO HAVE BEEN HIT HARD AS WELL. FOR THESE REASONS I RESPECTFULLY AFTER I VOTE IN HERE WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT AND TO HAVE ANY ANSWERS ON TECHNICAL ISSUES- ANSWERED AS TONY BY YOU REPRESENTING THE SPONSOR OF THE BILL AND HE IS HERE TODAY- IF YOU HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS MADAM CHAIR SO- BEFORE WE START WITH OUR LEAD WITNESS- SENATOR. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR- ARTICULATING THE AMENDMENTS REALLY APPRECIATE IT I WANT TO JUST- AND I MAY NOT OF HEARD IT BUT I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY THAT YOU'RE ALSO TAKING THE AMENDMENT THAT SHOWS THAT THAT THREE NINETY SIX B. ONLY. APPLIES TO NON RENTAL HOUSING. YEAH MA'AM OKAY. AND THEN- WE COULD DO THIS IN THE END BUT THERE'S AN OUTSTANDING AMENDMENT THAT WAS STILL GOING TO BE A DISCUSSED IN WOULD BE TAKEN AT THE NEXT COMMITTEE BUT THAT'S THE ONE ABOUT THE- THE NO LAW GOVERNING WHAT HAPPENS WHEN A RENTAL UNIT BECOMES VACANT DURING A STATE OF EMERGENCY AND THAT WE WOULD WORK OUT SOMETHING THAT WOULD ADDRESS TRYING TO PREVENT EXCESSIVE BRANDED YES HE WAS ACTING MANAGER WE TRY TO CLEAN IT UP RIGHT SO I COULD BRING IT BEFORE USE HAPPINESS POSSIBLE WONDERFUL I APPRECIATE AND THEN SENATOR WIENER DID YOU EVER QUESTION ANOTHER QUESTION I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE OUR- FULLY UNDERSTAND WHAT'S NOW IN THE BILL AND I THINK I UNDERSTAND BUT I'M VERY. GOOD AT SO I HADA- IN ADDITION TO THE ITEMS THAT THAT THE CHAIR MENTIONS- SO AND I THINK YOU SAID IS THAT THE 10% INCREASE WILL WILL REMAIN AS IS THE SERVERS ARE OVER THE LIFE OF A STATE OF EMERGENCY UP 210% CAP NOT 10% PER YEAR- THE- YES WEBSITE REQUIREMENT WILL STAY- AND THEN THE FINDINGS ISSUE WILL- THE- AFTER. FINDINGS THAT IT- RELATES TO HOUSING- ROOTED SIMMERED SEE IMPACTS HOUSING- HAS TO BE IT FOR ONLY THE LAST FOR MORE THAN A YEAR IT'S NOT THE BEGINNING- AND THEN- RENT CONTROLLED HOUSING AFFORDABLE HOUSING WILL REMAIN SUBJECT TO- THE RENDELL'S DOING PROTECTIONS YES SIR THAT'S ALL I CARE THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT RUSSIA AND- THAT'S WHY WE WANTED TO MAKE THE AMENDMENTS AND CLARIFY EVERYTHING AS WE CAN ALONG RATHER THAN DO IT LATER BECAUSE THAT'S WHY I STARTED OUT AS A PRETTY SIMPLE BILL BECAUSE OF THE WORK THAT THE CHAIRS AND I'VE WORKED OUT WITH STAFF AND IF YOU STILL NEED ANY TECHNICAL HAVE ANY TECH TO QUESTIONS- WIDELY HERE REAL FAIR TO NOT FROM OUR LEAGUE. THIS IS- GO AHEAD MR RUIZ THERE YOU GO THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR CERTAINLY THANK YOU SENATOR- THANK YOU COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND CHAIR- TWENTY BUT WITH THE A CALIFORNIA APARTMENT ASSOCIATION THAT WE ARE THE SPONSORS OF SB ONE ONE THREE THREE- AS WE ALL KNOW THE EMERGENCY SERVICE ACT ENABLES THEGOVERNOR'S DECLARED STATE OF EMERGENCIES TO ALLOW.

AND WITH THOSE HUNDRED APPROXIMATIONS HAVE BEEN DECLARED LOCALLY AND STATEWIDE. THE NEED TO UNDERSTAND WHAT ORDER IS IN EFFECT AND HOW IT APPLIES. IS CRUCIAL. FOR COMPLAINTS IN THE MARKETPLACE AT THE CENTRE MENTIONED- UNFORTUNATELY IT IS TOUGH TO UNDERSTAND- CURRENT LA AND- I'M SORRY. AN UNFORTUNATE COLONEL MAKES IT TOUGH FOR LANDLORDS TO KNOW IF THEIR UNITS. ARE INDEED SUBJECT TO THE ANTI PRICE GOUGING LAW. WHICH IS TRIGGERED- WHEN DECORATIONS CALLED- THIS BILL PROVIDES YOU THE CLARITY AS OUTLINED BY SENATOR ARCH LETTER. THAT WILL HELP- INSUREDS FROM THE COMPLAINTS IN THE MARKETPLACE.

I'M ALSO HAPPY TO MOVE THE BILL- HELLO I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR AND SPONSOR FOR WORKING WITH- WITH- WORKING WITH US TO ON THE COMMITTEE TO. REALLY TRUST SOME OF THE ISSUES- FIVE BUT I THINK THE CHANGES I'M REALLY POSITIVE- AND I KNOW IT SEEMS LIKE THE HEART OF THE BILL IS I THINK I DON'T WANT TO. SPECULATE BUT I THINK IT'S ABOUT THE- YES WEBSITE SEEMS LIKE. A VERY IMPORTANT THAT YOU DON'T CALL THE HEART OF THE GOVERNOR VERY IMPORTANT. PIECE AND I REALLY- SYMPATHETIC TO THE FRUSTRATION THAT. LANDLORDS AND FRANKLY TENANTS- WHO WANT TO KNOW LIKE WHAT'S THE SCOPE OF- PARTICULAR EMERGENCY AND KNOW WHAT THE REAL EVERYONE SHOULD KNOW WHAT THE RULES. ARE AND I WAS SURPRISED TO LEARN THAT. SURPRISED NOT SURPRISED I'M NOT- YES THAT'S A REALLY GOOD JOB IN A LOT OF WAYS BUT JUST GIVEN GOVERNMENT IN GENERAL GOVERNMENT WEBSITES ARE NOT ALWAYS KNOWN- FOR BEING- AS OF TODAY AS A- NEED TO BE THE CDC WEBSITE FOR EXAMPLE SOMETIMES I GO THERE AND- IT'S OUT OF DATE AND CVC- SO- I THINK ANYTHING WE CAN DO TO GET. THAT WBSITE UP TO DATE FOR EVERYONE'S BENEFIT IS IMPORTANT. AND SO I KNOW THEY'LL BE CONTINUING CONVERSATIONS WITH- OPPONENTS ON BUT I THINK THIS IS A REALLY POSITIVE STOP AND SO I'M HAPPY TO MOVE THE BALL- AND BEFORE YOU CLOSE SENATOR ARCHULETA ID. I THINK THE OTHER PORTION IS OF COURSE- YOU KNOW THERE'S BEEN CRITICISM THAT- SOME OF THE STATES OF EMERGENCY HAVE LASTED LONGER THAN A YEAR THOUGH I THINK THAT IN. WHAT IS BEEN DEMONSTRATES THAT A NUMBER OF THESE EMERGENCIES REALLY DO YOU HAVE IMPLICATIONS LONGER THAN A YEAR IF WE TAKE FOR EXAMPLE THE FIRE IN PARADISE PARADISE. IT WAS FAR MORE THAN A YEAR. BEFORE MANY OF THE PEOPLE DISPLACED. WERE ABLE TO GET- THEIR HOUSING REPLACED AND IF HOUSING WAS AVAILABLE. FOR THOSE WHO DID YOU KNOW WHO HAD LOST THEIR- HOMES AND WE'RE STILL TRYING TO GET THEM REPLACED WE CERTAINLY WANT. THIS KIND OF PROTECTION FOR THAT RIGHT WE DON'T WANT THEM- AND OF COURSE WE KNOW THAT. ALL OWNERS OF HOUSING OR NOT. FIVE PRICE CHARACTERS BUT WE CERTAINLY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE ARE PROTECTED HEN THEY HAVE BEEN THE VICTIMS OF KINDS OF EMERGENCIES. AND THERE CERTAINLY I COULD GIVE OTHER EXAMPLES WHERE. AND YET THEY'RE SOME OF THE STATE'S EMERGENCY WHERE IT MAY BE LEGITIMATE FOR THE GOVERNOR TO HAVE TO RE CLARIFY WHY HOUSING IS STILL AN ISSUE IN THAT STATE OF. AMENDMENTS THAT YOU'VE AGREED TO WHEN YOU WERE AT WORK OUT I THINK THAT IT IS LEAST HAD SOME CLARITY ABOUT. NUMBER ONE PEOPLE KNOW. THAT THIS IS IN EFFECT AND THEY CAN GO TO OUR WEBSITE AND FIND OUT IN NUMBER TWO THAT YOU CAN BE REAFFIRMED YOU KNOW WHY THIS PARTICULAR NEED OF PREVENTING THE PRICE GOUGING AND HOUSING NEEDS TO CONTINUE. SO WILL- LET YOU CLOSE AND THEN WE'LL TAKE ABOUT- MANAGER THANK YOU SO MUCH AND I URGE YOUR I THOUGHT. ALL RIGHT SO IT'S SEVERAL CALLS AND IT WOULD BE- TO PASS AS AMENDED WITH THE- WITH TWO MINUTES STILL TO BE WORKED OUT AND- IT GOES TO APPROPRIATIONS OKAY GREAT. A B. R. S. B. ELEVEN THIRTY THREE SKINNER BY SKINNER I INTRO BOGUE TROUBLE GUY KAMAGRA. KAMAGRA I WINNER WINNER I. FORTY ZERO. EXCELLENT THAT BILL IS OUT AND THEN WE HAVE NOW HAVE SENATOR GORGEOUS AND- THANK YOU VERY. MUCH FOR CHILLS OUT FOR ZERO- AND WE HAVE A HARD STOP AT FIVE HERE DO THEY LIKE JUST FOR A MOMENT I WILL BE RIGHT BACK AND- WE'LL PROCEED I WILL BE RIGHT BACK. FOR SUCH A HIGH TECH BUILDING SCOTT YOU MIGHT APPRECIATE IT THIS SHOULD. I'VE I'VE I STOPPED MAKING JOKES ABOUT IT AFTER LIKE THE FIFTH HEARING BECAUSE I BECAME LIKE THAT GUY THIS IS MY FIRST TIME IN THIS. HERBAL THE RAISED THE ISSUE. HAHA I LOVE IT THEY'RE GOING TO FIX IT. TO START SAYING THAT I ACTUALLY LIKE IT TOP RATED PERFECT. I FEEL LIKE WE GOT DELAYED INTO. A STOOL. WELCOME SENATOR PORTIONS PLEASE PROCEED WELCOME I THANK YOU I APPRECIATE IT- THANK YOU A MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT S. B. THIRTEEN THIRTY A BILL THAT SEEKS TO CLOSE A LOOPHOLE IN OUR CURRENT FETAL KERR AS IT RELATES TO THREATS DIRECTED AT SCHOOLS AND PLACES OF WORSHIP. SOME OF YOU WHO WERE SERVING ON THIS COMMITTEE IN TWENTY NINETEEN MAY RECALL HEARING A SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR BILL AT THE TIME IT WAS B. B. NINE OH SEVEN AUTHORED BY ASSEMBLYMAN GRAYSON. THE BILL RECEIVED SUBSTANTIAL BIPARTISAN SUPPORT FROM THIS COMMITTEE AND I WANT TO THANK ALL THOSE NOT HERE CHAIRMAN BRADFORD- AND SENATORS SO SKINNER AND WIENER FOR SUPPORTING THAT EFFORT BACK THEN IN HOPE- TO A CORNER THAT SEEM SUPPORT TODAY FOR S. B. THIRTEEN THIRTY. SCHOOLS AND PLACES OF WORSHIP ALL ACROSS CALIFORNIA HAVE SEEN AN UPTICK IN PRODUCTIVITY. THREATS IN ACTS OF VIOLENCE HAVE BEEN CARRIED OUT AT CHURCHES AND PLACES OF WORSHIP ALL OVER THE NATION MOST RECENTLY AT THAT YOUR BOT SYNAGOGUE IN POWAY. WHERE ONE WOMAN WAS KILLED AND THREE OTHERS INJURED INCLUDING AN EIGHT YEAR OLD CHILD. IN DECEMBER YOU MAY RECALLTHERE WAS A NATIONWIDE TICK TOCK THREAT WHICH KEPT COUNTLESS CHILDREN HOME AND OUT OF FEAR OF THE WHAT IF IT WERE REAL. MORNING SIDE HIGH SCHOOL IN MONROE MIDDLE SCHOOL IN CENTER BRADFORD'S DISTRICT WERE THREATENED WITH A SHOOTING. CENTER COM LOGGERS DISTRICT A STUDENT AT CULVER CITY HIGH SCHOOL MADE CRIMINAL THREATS THREATS AS WELL. EVERY CISCO STATE IN SENATOR WIENER'S DISTRICT ALSO RECEIVED A THREAT EARLIER THIS YEAR. IN CENTER SKINNER- REPRESENTING BERKELEY HIGH SCHOOL- THAT SCHOOL RECEIVE AN ONLINE THREAT FOR POTENTIAL SCHOOL SHOOTING JUST A FEW YEARS BACK. THE STOCK BE REPORTED SIXTEEN THREATS JUST IN THE SACRAMENTO AREA DURING THIS FALL ALONE. THESE THREATS INCREASED NUMBER OF INCIDENTS AT SCHOOLS HAVE STUDENTS FEARING THAT A TRAGEDY COULD OCCUR ON THEIR SCHOOL GROUNDS. FBI HATE CRIME STATISTICS SHOW THAT INCIDENTS IN CHURCHES AND SYNAGOGUES TEMPLES AND MOSQUES INCREASED NEARLY 34% BETWEEN TWENTY FOURTEEN AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND AS WE ARE AWAITING MORE RECENT NUMBERS WE WILL SURELY FIND THOSE NUMBERS. INCREASE IN EVEN MORE ALARMING. WHAT HAPPENS WHEN A THREAT IS MADE WHEN A THREAT IS MADE TO A SCHOOL OR PLACE OF WORSHIP BECAUSE THIS FEAR IT DISRUPTS THE LEARNING PROCESS. IN THE SENSE OF SAFETY. THESE THREATS ALSO DIVERT LAW ENFORCEMENT RESOURCES LEAVING OTHER AREAS OF COMMUNITIES VULNERABLE MEMBERS. SOMETHING IS VERY WRONG HERE I THINK WE ALL UNDERSTAND THAT TO BE THE CASE IN OUR CURRENT CULTURE THE VAST MAJORITY OF THESE THREATS ARE ELECTRONIC SOCIAL MEDIA POSTINGS DIRECTED AT THE ENTITIES SUCH AS A SCHOOL OR CHURCH NOT NECESSARILY AT A SPECIFIC INDIVIDUAL. THERE IS A DEFICIENCY IN THE CRIMINAL THE CURRENT CRIMINAL CODE AS NOTHING ADEQUATELY CAPTURES A THREAT TO A SCHOOL OR PLACE OF WORSHIP THE CLOSEST CURRENT STATUTE IS PENAL CODE FOUR TWO TWO HOWEVER IT IS LIMITED TO THE THREAT OF AN INDIVIDUAL. THIS LOOPHOLE. IN THE LAW AS IT OCCURS WHEN THERE IS NOT A NAMED INDIVIDUAL OR INDIVIDUAL THAT IS THREATENED BUT RATHER A PLACE SUCH AS A SCHOOL OR PLACE OF WORSHIP. WITHOUT A NAME THE VICTIM PROSECUTORS HAVE HAD GREAT DIFFICULTY IN BEING ABLE TO ADDRESS THIS CRIMINAL ACTIVITY. UNDER EXISTING LAW AN INDIVIDUAL MUST BE THE TARGET OF THE OFFENSE. IN THE THREATEN INDIVIDUAL MUST BE IN SUSTAINED FEAR. WITHOUT PROVING ALL THE REQUIRED ELEMENTS BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT THE PROSECUTION WOULD FAIL. S. B. THIRTEEN THIRTY SIX TO CLARIFY. DEAD AT THAT A THREAT IS TREATED THE SAME WHETHER IT IS AGAINST A PERSON IN ENTITY OR PLACE MANY OF THESE THREATS COME FROM JUVENILE OFFENDERS AND WITHOUT A TRUE FINDING OF A VIOLATION OF A OFTEN WILL NOT RECEIVE SOCIAL SERVICES OR MENTAL HEALTH ASSISTANCE. THESE THREATS MAY INDEED BE A CRY FOR HELP AND WILL CONTINUE TO SLIP THROUGH THE CRACKS OF OUR CURRENT SYSTEM STILL HAVE WITH ME AT THIS POINT REPRESENTED FROM THE FRESNO COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE- GALEN READY AGA. CHIEF DEPUTY DA FROM THE JUVENILE UNIT AND BETH HOLTZMAN COUNSEL FOR THE ANTI DEFAMATION LEAGUE. DO WE HAVE GALEN RIVIERA ON THE PHONE. I'M HERE PERFECT PLEASE PROCEED FOR. THANK YOU MY NAME'S KAELIN READY AGAIN THE CHIEF DEPUTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY FOR FRESNO COUNTY I'M IN CHARGE OF THE JUVENILE UNIT AND MANAGED CARE AND MEMBERS I COME IN THE SPONSOR FOR F. B. THIRTEEN THIRTY AND URGE YOUR SUPPORT FOR THIS BILL I DID SPEAK TO PROTECT SOME OF OUR MOST VALUABLE MEMBERS OF SOCIETY DIDN'T AND RELIGIOUS. WORSHIPPERS AS WE ALL KNOW THE THREAT OF GUN VIOLENCE IS ALL TOO PREVALENT IN OUR SOCIETY CURRENTLY. AS EVIDENCED BY THE RECENT EVENTS THERE IN SACRAMENTO. WE ALL AGREE ABOUT THE IMPACT OF TRAGIC EVENT. THE MASS SHOOTING HOWEVER THE METER READ OF A SHOOTING AT A SCHOOL OR HOUSE OF WORSHIP. IS ALSO DRAMATIC AND THE DISRUPTIVE EVENT. WITH THE PREVALENCE OF SOCIAL MEDIA AND IT IS JUVENILE. AND INDIVIDUAL CAN'T CREATE ANONYMOUS SOCIAL MEDIA PAGE THAT THREATENED A SCHOOL OR A HOUSE VERSION IN GENERAL WITHOUT NAMING OR CARRIED IN AN INDIVIDUAL. WHEN THIS OCCURS HE WALKED IN THE FACT THAT THESE POLICIES DO NOT MEET THE REQUIREMENTS NEEDED TO PURSUE A CHARGE. THE CLOSEST- STATUTE AND THE ONE WE OFTEN LOOK AS AS MENTIONED BY SENATOR BORDERS IF HE'LL COACH FOR TWENTY TWO. HOWEVER THAT. STATUE WAS NOT MADE OR CREATED. OR THE CURRENT SCENARIO WE SEE. AND THERE'S A LIMITATION TO PROMOTE ACT- RIGHT UNDER PENAL CODE OR TWENTY TWO. AS STATED BY HER BORDERS IT REQUIRES AN IDENTIFIABLE VICTIM TO BE ASSISTING IN FEAR FOR THEIR OWN SAFETY. OR THEIR IMMEDIATE SAFETY OF THEIR MEAT FAMILY UPON BEING MADE AWARE OF THE THREAT. AND THE VICTIMS FEAR WAS REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES CIRCUMSTANCES. WHAT MANY TIMES NO SINGLE PERSON FACTUALLY MEETS ALL THOSE REQUIREMENTS NEEDED TO SUSTAIN THE CHARGE OF A CRIMINAL THREAT WILL FIX THAT HOLE I'M GOING TO GO ON IT IS UNCOMMON LIGHTLY TOWARDS THE- PUBLIC SAFETY ANALYSIS MENTIONS OF TWO CASES IN PARTICULAR FIRST WHAT IS IN RATE AG WHICH IS FOUND THAT FIFTY EIGHT CAL APP FIFTH SIX FORTY SEVEN. FOR A PETITION WAS THE STANDS WERE GENERIC THREAT WAS POSTED TO A SNAP CHAT. OR A WHICH IS A ONE MEANS OF SOCIAL. HOWEVER IN THS CASE BOTH A STUDENT AND A TEACHER DIRECTOR RECEIVED THAT PERPETRATORS ACTUAL MEDICINES AND CAME IN AND TESTIFIED AS TO THAT FEAR BASED ON ONCE UPON A RECEIVING THAT MESSAGE. WE ARE TRYING TO CAPTURE NOT ONES WHERE WE HAVE AN INDIVIDUAL BUT WHERE WE DO NOT HAVE AN INDIVIDUAL THAT WAS IN THE STATE FAIR. ALSO MENTION WITHIN THE STATE IT ALSO THIS. IS A- SECOND CASE. IN RAY LF- IT'S A UNPUBLISHED OPINION WHICH IS NOT AVAILABLE RECORD HOWEVER THAT ONE TO PERPETRATE ME NUMEROUS COMMENTS ON SOCIAL MEDIA BELIEVE WITH TWITTER. AND WAS CLEAR THAT THE STATEMENTS WERE READ. THE VICE PRINCIPAL RECEIVED A SCREENSHOT OF THE ACTUAL THREAT. AND CAME INTO COURT AND WAS ABLE TO TESTIFY BEING SCARED AND NERVOUS HAVE YOU SEEN THOSE THREATS. FOR HIS OWN SAFETY AS HE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR IMPLEMENTING THE LOCKDOWN PROTOCOL HE WOULD BE A WOULD BE IN DANGER IN DOING SO- AS WE NOTED AND AS THE OTHER BORDERS NOTED WE ANTICIPATE THE VAST MAJORITY OF THESE TO BE JUVENILES THAT ARE- ENCOUNTERS. WITH THIS AMENDMENT OR CHANGE- AND AS A NOTED IN AN ENGAGING THE PRIMARY GOAL OF THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM IS GENERALLY BILLET KATE OFFENDERS. RATHER THAN PUNISH THEM SO- WE FEEL MR AREA WOULD YOU MIND- WRAPPING IT UP JUST A TAD FASTER RIGHT NOW SO WE CAN HAVE A BETTER CHANCE MAN COME AND SPEAK. YEAH YEAH.

AND ONCE AGAIN IF YOU'RE IN OPPOSITION OF SB THIRTEEN THIRTY THREE STEPS ONE BEEN ZERO AT THIS TIME. AND YOUR FIRST BUT THIS TIME WE HAVE NO ONE ELSE IN Q. SORRY LET'S RETURN IT TO THE- DYESS- COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS YES SENATOR WIENER- THANK YOU A MANAGER. ON WE'RE HAVING SOME. CONVERSATION ABOUT HOW THIS BILL COMPARES TO EIGHTY NINE OH SEVEN- BY SOME MEMBER GRACE AND THAT. THIS COMMITTEE ACTUALLY PASSED UNANIMOUSLY AND TWENTY NINETEEN WAS OLD MY HELD- ON SUSPENSE IN THE APPROPRIATIONS. COMMITTEE AND I KNOW ONE DIFFERENCE IS THAT BILL WAS A MISDEMEANOR FOR JUVENILES IN SORT OF A WOBBLER- AND I THINK THE LIABILITY MAY HAVE BEEN. POSSIBLY BROADER IN SOME RESPECTS- BUT I IT- I'M DEFINITELY INTERESTED IN IN KNOWING HOW THE TWO BILLS. ARE COMPARE- IF I DON'T HEAR. IT MIGHT MAKE SENSE TO POTENTIALLY PUT THE BILL OVER TO HAVE A CLEAR ANSWER- ON- BUT THAT'S JUST MY- WON'T TAKE BECAUSE I KNOW I'VE HI ALONG WITH EVERY OTHER MEMBER OF THE COMMITTEE VOTED FOR THE GRACE AND ALL TWENTY NINETEEN SO- THAT'S JUST MY- COMMENT. YES SENATOR CORKER THANK YOU WELL I WAS NOT ON THAT COMMITTEE I WAS IN PUBLIC SAFETY WHERE IT WAS HEARD. AND I ACTUALLY- DID NOT VOTE FOR THAT BILL I HAD SOME CONCERNS AND THOSE CONCERNS ARE VERY SIMILAR TO THE CONCERNS THAT I HAVE WITH THIS BILL AND- HE I AM. WELL AS I WAS LISTENING I WAS ALSO SORT OF THINKING ABOUT A REAL LIFE SCENARIO THAT HAPPENED WITH MY FAMILY- WITH MY YOUNG CHILD- AND HAVING A FOURTEEN YEAR OLD- WHO IS OBVIOUSLY HAVING CHALLENGES AT HOME TO BE CHARGED WITH A FELONY. DOES IS DOES IS NOT IN CONCERT WITH HOW I REVIEW- BILLS THERE- YOU KNOW I DO HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THE INCONSISTENCIES OF IMPLEMENTATION WITH THIS DEPENDING ON THE COUNTY THAT YOU'RE IN DEPENDING ON THE SCHOOL- AND HOW THAT IS RUNNING MAYBE THE PRINCIPLES IN THE FRAMEWORK OF THAT PARTICULAR INSTITUTION- I WILL ALSO SHARE THAT- AND I CERTAINLY AM NOT GOING TO GET INTO. DETAILS BECAUSE MINORS WERE INVOLVED BUT THERE WAS GRAVE INCONSISTENCIES WITH HOW PUNISHMENT WAS- EXACTED ON A YOUNG BLACK CHILD VERSUS PUNISHMENT EXACTED ON THE YOUNG BLACK A WHITE CHILD. FOR VERY DIFFERENT. ISSUES BUT WHERE THE MORE EGREGIOUS- ACTUALLY WAS NOT WITH THAT- THE BLACK CHILD AND SO I WOULD JUST WANT TO I HAVE A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT. APPLICATION ABOUT CONSISTENCY ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT CERTAIN COMMUNITIES ARE CERTAIN PEOPLE ARE NOT TARGETED- IT WAS RAISED ABOUT THOSE THAT HAVE MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES THERE'S ALSO AN ISSUE ABOUT SOMEONE WHO'S IDT- DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES- YOU KNOW. WHEN SOMEONE IS MAKING A TRUE THREAT VERSUS A FALSE THREAT HOW THAT IS HANDLED- GIVEN COVE IT AND THE FACT THAT THERE HAVE BEEN STUDIES THAT COME OUT THAT HAVE COME OUT THAT SAY FOR EXAMPLE THERE'S BEEN A OF. OF FROM GIRLS OF GIRLS AND SO IF HOW ARE WE MANAGING EITHER THE ANXIETY OR DEPRESSION OR THE SADNESS THAT THEY'RE FEELING THAT THEY MIGHT NOT UNDERSTAND HOW TO SHARE IN A WAY THAT IS HEALTHY FOR THEM- AND DO WE LEAN ON THE CRIMINAL SYSTEM. TO HELP THEM COME TO THOSE DECISIONS I JUST DON'T KNOW BUT I AM CERTAINLY INTERESTED IN WOULD BE WILLING TO HOLD IT OVER SO THAT WE CAN GET MORE INFORMATION TO SEE IF THERE IS- YOU KNOW IF WHAT THE PARALLELS MANY MAYBE WITH ANOTHER BAIL. BUT I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN ADDRESS ANY OF THOSE CONCERNS THAT I RAISED BUT THEY WERE SIMILAR- TO WHAT I RAISED THEM WITH THE OTHER BILL. GO AHEAD SIR BORDERS PICTURE. TO MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT WE GET INTO THE REAL PARTICULARS I WOULD CERTAINLY WANT TO BRING UP- MR RUDY I GOT- TO GET INTO THE DETAILS OF THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FOUR TWENTY TWO ONE TWENTY EIGHT BUT MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT ASSEMBLY BILL- NINE OH SEVEN THIS IS SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR. AND I THINK WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN WITH THE BILL PROCESS IS THAT. IT'S ALSO AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE AUTHOR TO LEARN WHAT IS IMPORTANT TO- HIS OR HER COLLEAGUES. AND IF IT MEANS THAT HE WOULD MEET WITH THE APPROVAL OF THIS BOARD AND CONTINUE THIS- THIS COMMITTEE A MOVE THIS PROCESS ALONG. I COULD ABSOLUTELY I AGREE THAT WE WOULD CONVERT IT FOR MINORS TO BE MISDEMEANORS I IF THAT WAS ONE DISTINCTION THAT WAS EVENTUALLY ACHIEVED WITH THE PREVIOUS AUTHOR. BECAUSE THERE ARE THERE ARE THERE ARE ISSUES WHEN YOU'RE DEALING WITH MINORS. BUT LET'S ALSO NOT FORGET THE FACT THAT THERE ARE SUBSTANTIAL ISSUES. ARE WITH THE IMPACT TO THE COMMUNITY TO THE SCHOOL ARE TO THE MOSQUE TO THE TEMPLE TO THE CHURCH. WINDIES THREATS OCCUR. ODD WHICH IS WHY WE HEARD FROM THE- FROM THE PROSECUTORS THAT THIS IS APPROPRIATELY- A FALSE REPORT UNDER ONE FORTY EIGHT WHICH IS WHY IT WAS PUT. IN ONE FORTY EIGHT AS OPPOSED TO FOUR TWENTY TWO. BUT IN TERMS OF- OF LOOKING AFTER INDIVIDUALS THAT MAYBE HAVE- DISABILITIES OR WHO HAVE NOT FULLY APPRECIATED THEM RAMIFICATIONS OF THEIR HANDS OF THEIR ACTIONS. A MISDEMEANOR OR DO YOU THE POTENTIAL FOR THE APPLICATION OF A MISDEMEANOR CHARGE. I OPENS THE DOOR CERTAINLY FOR MENTAL HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICES TO GET INVOLVED. BUT LET'S NOT FORGET THAT ALL IT TAKES IS A THREAT AND THEY CAN CLOSE DOWN AN ENTIRE COMMUNITY IT CAN CLOSE DOWN AN ENTIRE SCHOOL THERE HAS TO BE A SENSE OF. BALANCE THAT LOOKS AFTER THE INTERESTS OF THE INDIVIDUAL WHO IS ALLEGED TO HAVE PERPETRATED THE THREAT. AS WELL AS THE WHOLE UPON WHICH THAT PERSON IS ACTING IN AFFECTING AND THAT'S WHAT I THINK THIS BILL DOES IS THAT IF IT MEETS WITH YOUR APPROVAL AND I KNOW IT IS DONE SO IN TWENTY NINETEEN AS IT PASSED UNANIMOUSLY THROUGH THIS COMMITTEE BEFORE. THAT IF WE WERE TO CONVERT THE EIGHTEEN AND UNDER TO MISDEMEANORS. THEN I WOULD ABSOLUTELY GIVE YOU MINE MY WORDS THAT IS HOW IT WILL BE REDRAFTED ONCE IS MOVED TO THE NEXT STAGE. I'M. SENATOR WIENER YEAH AND I AND VICTOR I'M NOT MAKING A ANY COMMITMENTS ON THIS BILL THERE'S WHEN. USE NON WEEKS SUPPORTED BELLA COMMITTEE UNDER ANY REAL YOU KNOW COME BACK FEARS YOU TAKE ANOTHER AT A YOU SORT OF. REALIZE MAYBE SHOULD HAVE SUPPORTED THE FIRST TIME I SCAN REMEMBER YOUR THREE YEARS AGO SOMETHING TIME ALL THIS HAPPENED LAST THREE YEARS- SO ARE. YOU KNOW AND I. TO ME ALSO THIS IS I DON'T GET ME WRONG IT'S TERRIBLE WHEN SOMEONE CALLS IN A FALSE THREAT AND SHUTS DOWN THE SCHOOL IT'S EXTREMELY DISRUPTIVE- IT'S ALSO NOT LIKE PHYSICALLY HARMING SOMEONE OR IT'S DISRUPTIVE TO THE COMMUNITY AND IT'S BAD DON'T GET ME WRONG- BUT I. I ALSO WONDER IF WE SHOULD EVEN BE- A WOBBLER IF MAYBE IT SHOULD BE A MISDEMEANOR AND MAYBE EVEN FOR YOUTH. YOU KNOW INFRACTION WITH. ANGER MANAGEMENT OR THIRTY OR SOMETHING I JUST I'M JUST SORT OF BRAINSTORMING OUT LOUD- YEAH I DON'T KNOW SO I WILL SAY IN- AND THIS IS ONLY ONE INSTANCE BUT IN YOU KNOW- THE INSTANCE THAT I'M SPECIFICALLY REFERRING TO THERE WERE RAMIFICATIONS FOR THAT PARTICULAR STUDENT. THAT BIRD THAT CHILD WAS IMMEDIATELY EXPELLED THEY HAD RAMIFICATIONS WITH THE PARENTS IT IMPACTED THEIR ABILITY TO GO TO ANOTHER pIMMEDIATE CONSEQUENCES- AND IT WAS THE END NOTHING HAPPENS THEY DID NOT ENACT THEY DID NOT GO THROUGH WITH THE THINGS THAT THEY WERE SAYING. EIGHT AND TRUTHFULLY. THE NEXT WEEK SOMEBODY ELSE DID SOMETHING THAT WAS EQUALLY SORT OF. USEFUL AND WILD AND THAT BECAME VERY OLD NEWS THE RESILIENCY OF YOUNG PEOPLE IS EQUALLY ASTONISHING BUT I WILL SAY IN THIS PARTICULAR INSTANCE- AND THE THING THAT HAPPENED. WAS NOT NICE SO I'M CERTAINLY NOT TRYING TO PLACATE OR OR GLOSS OVER BUT THERE WERE IMMEDIATE AND SEVERE RAMIFICATIONS FOR BOTH THE PARENT AND THE CHILD THAT ARE STILL FELT TO THIS DAY BY THAT PARTICULAR FAMILY I DO THINK THERE ARE OTHER WAYS TO GO ABOUT SAFETY AND CONSEQUENTIAL EXPERIENCE THAT WE'RE ALL LOOKING FOR- I SIR AND I DON'T ALWAYS KNOW IF USING THE WEAPON OR THE TOOL THAT IS THE CRIMINAL LEGAL SYSTEM IS APPROPRIATE ESPECIALLY FOR YOUNG KIDS. HE WAS VERY CLOSE MADAM CHAIR ARM I WILL SEE IF THERE'S ANY OTHER COMMENT OTHERWISE THEY WILL ALLOW YOU TO CLOSE. OKAY GREAT. THE SECOND WITNESS THAT- APPEAR TELEPHONICALLY IN OPPOSITION. IDENTIFIED ON THE LIST OF EVENTS THAT. THIS IS A BILL LIKE THIS WOULD TARGET CASUAL CONVERSATION. NOTHING COULD BE FURTHER FROM THE TRUTH. I THINK WE ALL KNOW HIS SPECIALLY IN OUR DIGITAL ERA AND SOME OF US PREDATE THAT SO HE CAN CLEARLY. MYSELF INCLUDED CLEARLY DISTINGUISH WHAT THINGS WERE LIKE PRIOR TO SOCIAL MEDIA AND- EVERYBODY HAVING A SOPHISTICATED CELL PHONE. THIS ISNOT APPLYING TO CASUAL CONVERSATION FOLKS. WE'RE TALKINGABOUT THREATS. THAT COULD BE LEVIED AGAINST A TEMPLE. IN THE CONTEXT OF EXTRAORDINARY ANTI SEMITISM. TO WHICH MEMBERS OF THE CONGREGATION AND LEADERSHIP OF THAT COMIC CONGREGATION CANNOT AFFORD. TO TAKE IT AT FACE VALUE AND THEY MUST RESPOND CANCEL SERVICES OR CANCEL THE EVENT AT THE- THE COMPLEX OF THE RELIGIOUS INSTITUTION. AND FORCIBLY REMOVE FOLKS FROM THE AREA. SAME THING WITH A SCHOOL SETTING. THAT THEY CAN'T AFFORD NOT TO TAKE THESE THINGS SERIOUSLY SO WE HAVE TO ALSO TAKE THREATS LIKE THIS SERIOUSLY BOYS IF THERE IS A THREAT LEVIED AT THE SCHOOL I'LL BE IF I'M GONNA WANT THEM TO STAY IN THERE AS WE FIGURED OUT THE MERITS OF THIS THREAT. I'M GOING TO WANT THE PROTOCOL TO BE IMMEDIATE SHUTDOWN REMOVAL OFF PREMISE END OF STORY. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN FOR KIDS. THAT MEANS THEY ARE TAKEN OUT OF SCHOOL. THEY ARE SCARED AND WE ARE NOT PROVIDING ANY ENVIRONMENT THAT FOSTERS EDUCATION AND COMFORT. THINK OF THE SOCIAL IMPLICATIONS OF HOW THIS TOOL IF USED INAPPROPRIATELY CAN AFFECT ALL OF US WHETHER IT BE A SYNAGOGUE A MOSQUE OR CHURCH OR SCHOOL OR UNIVERSITY. OR ANY NUMBER OF ACTIVITIES THAT TAKE PLACE AT THOSE FACILITIES. THIS BILL IN SHORT CLOSES A LOOPHOLE BY ALLOWING A THREAT AGAINST AN INDIVIDUAL A THREAT AGAINST IT INDIVIDUAL TO NOW INCLUDE A PLACE. IT SOUNDS IT'S A SOUND REASON TO ALLOW FOR AN EXTENSION LIKE THAT BECAUSE THE PARTICULARITY OF A THREAT AGAINST AN INDIVIDUAL THAT INDIVIDUAL CAN RESPOND OR THE SCHOOL ADMINISTRATOR CAN TAKE SENATOR SKINNER OUT OF THE BUILDING BECAUSE SHE WAS THREATENED. A THREAT AGAINST A SCHOOL THE ENTIRE SCHOOL IS AT RISK. IT IS A MULTIPLIER EFFECT WHEN YOU HAVE A SITUATION LIKE THIS. SO NO I UNDERSTAND THERE ARE SOCIAL CONSIDERATIONS AT THAT WE ALLOW THIS BILL SHOULD YOU BE WILLING TO MOVE FORWARD AND I THINK ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT IT IS AT PLAY HERE IS WHETHER OR NOT. IT SHOULD NO LONGER BE A WOBBLER FOR MINORS BUT INSTEAD A MISDEMEANOR. IF I WOULD IF I'D BE ENTITLED TO YOUR SUPPORT TODAY I GIVE YOU MY WORD. I WILL CONTINUE TO ENGAGE WITH THE INDIVIDUALS- IN- WITH THE ACLU AND OTHER ORGANIZATIONS AND OTHER FOLKS VERY KNOWLEDGEABLE ON HOW RULES LIKE THIS CAN APPLY IN BE MISUSED SHOULD BE THAT WAY. TO MAKE THIS EVEN BETTER BUT I HAVE TO BE GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY NO THIS IS THE THIRD TIME THIS BILL HAS BEEN BROUGHT FORWARD. ONCE BY TWENTY IN TWENTY NINETEEN BYE BYE SIMPLY MEMBER GRAYSON WHICH PASSED THE ASSEMBLY PASSED THIS COMMITTEE IN JUST GOT HELD UP IN APPROACH. I INTRODUCE THIS AGAIN- BUT DURING COVE IT AND THEN I GOT KICKED OUT BECAUSE A COVE IT. AS ALL OF US WERE CALLING OUR BILLS FOR THOSE THAT WERE BY RICK VERY IMPORTANT. SO THIS IS THE LAST OPPORTUNITY AT LEAST TO TRICK MY TENURE. AS AS A SENATOR AND I WOULD RESPECTFULLY- ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT AND AS I MENTIONED BEFORE IN CLOSING THIS IS A SIMPLE BILL. IT CLOSES A LOOPHOLE IN CURRENT LAW AND MAKES CLEAR D. OR AMBIGUITY CURRENTLY EXISTS- NO INDIVIDUAL SHOULD BE SCARED TO ATTEND SCHOOL OR GATHER TO WORSHIP IN THIS BILL WILL BE HELPFUL. COLLEAGUES I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I. SUPPORT AND ALLOW ME TO CONTINUE WORKING ON THIS BILL THROUGH THE NEXT EVOLUTION. A THOROUGH BEFORE I CALL ON VOTE- I WILL BE VERY HONEST I WOULD SHARE THE COMMITTEE I THINK AT THAT POINT AND- I DON'T REMEMBER THE ANALYSIS ON GRAYSON'S BILL SO I. WHILE THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS SHOWS US THEIR SIMILARITIES I CERTAINLY CAN'T WITH CONFIDENCE SAY THAT. IT IS THAT SAY THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IS A MISDEMEANOR NOT SO I'D HAVE TO GO BACK AND READ THAT ANALYSIS AND REVIEW ALL THE MATERIALS. AND IN LISTENING TO THE PRESENTATION TODAY I'M STRUCK THAT LET'S ASSUME THAT THEY ARE ALMOST COMPARABLE. THEN I WONDER THREE HONEST ANSWER WHY WE WOULDN'T HAVE PUT IT AS AN INFRACTION AND NOT A MISDEMEANOR BECAUSE IN THESE KIND OF CIRCUMSTANCES ESPECIALLY WHEN IT RELATES TO SCHOOLS IF IT'S A MINOR. THEN THE- THAT PERSON COULD BRING IT TO A CRIMINAL OFFENSE I MEAN IT'S GOT SERIOUS ABSOLUTELY CORRECT CENTER BOARD JUST THAT THEIR ACT. DISRUPTS EVERYTHING AND ABSOLUTELY WANT A PROTOCOL THAT WHEN YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IS REALLY BEHIND THAT ACT YOU WANT TO PROTECT EVERYBODY YOU HAVE TO- HOWEVER SHOULD THE CONSEQUENCE ON A MINOR BE A CRIMINAL OFFENSE IS WHAT I THINK. WAIT IT LEAST ARM SOME OF US ARE TOYING WITH NOW. AND THE OTHER ISSUE THAT I SAW IN THE ANALYSIS IS THAT WHILE. THE IT'S SEVENTY EIGHT SEVENTY KIDDED THAT THEY REQUIRES THE PERPETRATOR TO NAME OF THE VICTIM IN ORDER TO DO THE PROSECUTION THERE WERE CITATIONS OF CASES WHERE THE PERPETRATOR IN THESE CASES WAS A MINOR AT THE HIGH SCHOOL DIDN'T SPECIFY THE VICTIM BUT INSTEAD TARGETED ALL STUDENTS AND STAFF OF PARTICULAR HIGH SCHOOL AND THEY WERE PROSECUTED. SO AGAIN NOT BEING THE DA NOT BEING A LAWYER YOU KNOW IS IT THAT I'M SURE LIKE A LOT OF US- HI EVERYBODY WANTS THINGS YOU KNOW COMPLETELY- DIGITAL NO GRAY AREA RIGHT BUT IT WOULD APPEAR THAT THERE IS THE ABILITY TO PROSECUTE OR AT LEAST IN THAT CASE THAT WOULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED AND THERE WERE A COUPLE OF OTHER CITATIONS. SO I AM. YEAH YOU KNOW I'M VERY. WISHING THE MISTER BRADFORD WAS HERE SO THAT HE COULD EXPRESS BECAUSE HE'S THE CHAIR DOT YOU KNOW I'M SITTING IS THAT YOU'RE RIGHT NOW BUT I. AND I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY YOU KNOW HIS THE COMMITTEE'S AGENDA MAY BE VERY CROWDED FOR ITS REMAINING TWO HERE THANKS- AND I THINK FOR YOU KNOW WE DID LEASE FOR MY I WOULD HAVE TO FULLY. ANALYZE THE GREASE UNTIL BEFORE I'D BE COMFORTABLE SAYING. YOU KNOW SO I THINK THE BEST. I'M JUST THINKING RIGHT NOW ON THE FLY THE BEST WE COULD DO PERHAPS IS GIVE YOU RECONSIDERATION. AND THEN ALLOW. MISTER BRADFORD TWO ENDS SCOTT AND WHOEVER ELSE SENATOR WE APOLOGIES FOR DOING- TO LOOK AT THAN THAT AT THE COMPARABILITY IS BETWEEN THE TWO BILLS AND WHETHER IT'S APPROPRIATE TO YOU KNOW MODIFY IT SUCH AND STILL MOVE THAT. I'M PERSONALLY THINKING THAT. EVEN A MISDEMEANOR WOULD NOT BE APPROPRIATE THAT IT ISN'T ESPECIALLY FOR MINOR THAT IT'S MUCH MORE IN THE INFRACTION AREA BUT GO AHEAD SIDNEY. I AM SORRY I COULD SIT IN A LATE SO WE'RE ALL YEAH I KNOW I ACTUALLY THINK THE GRAYSON BILL APPLY TO ACTUAL THREATS IN MIND OF AN ACTUAL AND PERCEIVED BUT- ITS ACTION THEY WERE ACTUAL RECORD VERSUS. THIS ONE WHICH IS A FALSE REPORT SO OKAY I THINK IT CONJOINED BUT ANYWAY RIGHT AFTER REVEALING A ROLE. RIGHT DID YOU WANNA MAKE A COMMENT SCISSOR WINNER NO. NO I MEAN I HAVE A HARD STOP INTO IT YEAH I THOUGHT THE AGES YOUR COMMITTEE I KNOW AND- YEAH I'M A- I'M NOT. HERE TO SUPPORT IT NOW ALL BUT I THINK IF WE- THERE THERE COULD BE A FORM. MAYBE TAKE OUT SCHOOLS MAYBE JUST PLACES OF WORSHIP I MEAN MAYBE IT'S INFRACTION IN IT MIGHT MAKE SENSE AFTER WE CONSIDERATION SO THAT MORE IDEAS CAN COME TO THE TABLE. THE CHAIR WITH DOC YEAH. PART THREE OF THE CLOSED WE HAVE A MOTION AND- ALL RIGHT. THEN WE WILL DO A ROLL CALL. S. S. B. THIRTEEN THIRTY DO PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS SKINNER SKINNER NOT VOTING A TROUBLE OAK HI JOE BOAKAI KAMAGRA. KAMAGRA NOT VOTING WINNER. WINNER NOT VOTING ONE VOTES WE ARE GRANTING RECONSIDERATION. THANK ALL RIGHT. OKAY SO LET US- WE'LL REOPEN THE VOTE ON. BILL HE IS YES THE TEN FORTY TO GO AT A SPEED TEN FORTY TWO COM LONGER COME LONGER NO VOTE IS ONE TO TWO. RIGHT THAT BILL FAILED I WANT TO DO BUT IT WAS GRANTED RECONSIDER. ALL RIGHT EARLY- DISPENSE WITH OLDER BUSINESS. ALL RIGHT SO. DO I NEED TO LAUGH IT IS NOT APPROPRIATE TO LEFT- WE HAD A LOT OF SERIOUS SUBJECT TODAY AND- ALL RIGHT RECALLING. THE DAYS WHEN I WAS HERE AND WE WOULD HAVE THESE A MARATHON MEETINGS BUT ANYWAY THANK YOU ALL FOR PARTICIPATING THANKS FOR THANKS TO THE PUBLIC.
