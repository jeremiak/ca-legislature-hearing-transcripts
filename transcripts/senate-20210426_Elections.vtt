ON- WITH THE COMMITTEE IS

00:20:27.993 --> 00:20:30.596
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO

00:20:30.662 --> 00:20:32.431
INSURE THAT THE- THIS ISSUE IS

00:20:32.497 --> 00:20:33.999
ADDRESSED. THE ENFORCEMENT OF

00:20:34.066 --> 00:20:35.200
COURSE IS A REAL THING I MEAN I

00:20:35.267 --> 00:20:37.002
MEAN OBVIOUSLY ANYONE WHO

00:20:37.069 --> 00:20:38.503
VIOLATES THE CURRENT LAW AND

00:20:38.570 --> 00:20:40.339
SUBJECT TO. THE PENALTIES.

00:20:40.405 --> 00:20:43.041
UNDER THE FTP OF PPC BUT AS WE

00:20:43.108 --> 00:20:45.077
KNOW THIS IS A- KIND OF A- VERY

00:20:45.143 --> 00:20:46.011
HARD TO POLICE WHEN YOU'RE

00:20:46.078 --> 00:20:47.879
TALKING ABOUT THEM MANY MANY

00:20:47.946 --> 00:20:48.981
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE OFTENTIMES

VOLUNTEERS WHO ARE ENGAGING IN

00:20:50.515 --> 00:20:52.050
THIS PRACTICE. SO THAT'S ONE OF

00:20:52.117 --> 00:20:53.151
THE REASONS WHY WE WANTED TO

00:20:53.218 --> 00:20:54.553
COME FOR LEGISLATION THAT

00:20:54.620 --> 00:20:57.689

ENFORCEMENT BUT THAT ACTUALLY.

00:20:58.724 --> 00:21:00.626
INCREASE THE CHANCES OF NOT

00:21:00.692 --> 00:21:01.727
ABOUT NOT NEEDING ENFORCEMENT

00:21:01.793 --> 00:21:02.894
RATES IT'S OBSERVE MORE

00:21:02.961 --> 00:21:04.663
LANGUAGE RIGHT THERE ON THE

00:21:04.730 --> 00:21:05.731

00:41:57.314 --> 00:41:58.215
TO GET ON THE BALLOT. THERE'S

00:41:58.282 --> 00:41:59.583
LOTS OF DIFFERENT WAYS TO TAKE

00:42:08.025 --> 00:42:10.127
ENTITIES THAT ACCEPT THE ADS

00:42:10.194 --> 00:42:12.463

ME. BUT THIS. SO THIS IS A

01:00:16.980 --> 01:00:19.282
HISTORIAN I AM VERY BRIEFLY.

01:00:19.349 --> 01:00:21.351
YOU KNOW WE DEVELOPED IN

01:00:21.417 --> 01:00:23.553
CALIFORNIA THE DECK A CENTURY

01:00:23.619 --> 01:00:26.956
AGO. REFORM MOVEMENT THAT CAME

01:00:27.023 --> 01:00:28.524
FROM A VERY CORRUPT SYSTEM

01:00:28.591 --> 01:00:30.026
WHERE THE LEGISLATURE WAS

01:00:30.093 --> 01:00:31.127
DRAMATICALLY IMPACTED BY THE

01:00:31.194 --> 01:00:33.229
RAILROADS THE REFERENDUM TO

01:00:33.296 --> 01:00:35.598
RECALL THE INITIATIVE WE SAID

01:00:35.665 --> 01:00:36.799
THAT LOCAL ELECTED OFFICIALS

01:00:36.866 --> 01:00:39.702
WERE NOT GOOD BUT WE'RE GOING

01:00:39.769 --> 01:00:43.139
TO BE NONPARTISAN. AND WE HAVE

01:00:43.206 --> 01:00:46.075
TRIED OVER THE YEARS TO.

01:00:46.142 --> 01:00:49.012
MODERNIZE THESE VARIOUS-

01:00:49.078 --> 01:00:50.747
SYSTEMS THAT ARE INFORMED BY

01:00:50.813 --> 01:00:52.482
THE POWER OF THE ELECTORATE ON

01:00:52.548 --> 01:00:54.617
THE ONE HAND BUT THAT HAVE BEEN

01:00:54.684 --> 01:00:56.953
ABUSED TO SOME EXTENT BY. SOUTH

01:00:57.020 --> 01:00:58.654
SIDE INTERESTS AND ONE THAT'S

01:00:58.721 --> 01:01:00.990
PARTICULARLY TROUBLESOME OF

01:01:01.057 --> 01:01:04.360
LATE IS THE REFERENDUM.

01:01:04.427 --> 01:01:05.395
GOVERNOR AND THE LEGISLATURE

01:01:05.461 --> 01:01:07.497
COME TOGETHER AND PASS A LAW

01:01:07.563 --> 01:01:09.198
BUT THE PEOPLE HAVE IT RESERVES

01:01:09.265 --> 01:01:11.534
THE RIGHT TO OVERTURN THAT LAW.

01:01:11.601 --> 01:01:13.469
AND TAKE IT FOR A FULL VOTE.

01:01:13.536 --> 01:01:15.438
WELL THE WAY THE LAW IS WRITTEN

01:01:15.505 --> 01:01:20.243
CREATES A- UNFAIR DISADVANTAGE

01:01:20.309 --> 01:01:21.778
THE PARTIES THERE'S TWO

01:01:21.844 --> 01:01:24.213
ELEMENTS TO IT ONE IS IT SAYS

01:01:24.280 --> 01:01:25.782
THAT IF IT'S A REFERENDUM IS A

01:01:25.848 --> 01:01:27.950
LAST ON THE BALLOT. THIS LAST

01:01:28.017 --> 01:01:30.086
YEAR THERE WAS A DROP OFF

01:01:30.153 --> 01:01:30.987
BETWEEN THE TOP OF THE BALLOT

01:01:31.054 --> 01:01:32.488
IN THE BOTTOM OF THE BALLOT BUT

01:01:32.555 --> 01:01:34.123
ONE POINT FOUR MILLION PEOPLE.

01:01:34.190 --> 01:01:37.427
SECOND IT'S WILDLY CONFUSING

01:01:37.493 --> 01:01:39.529
BECAUSE GENERALLY A PROPONENT

01:01:39.595 --> 01:01:41.798
OF A MEASURE ONCE A YES. AND

01:01:41.864 --> 01:01:43.933
THE OPPONENT WANTS TO KNOW WHAT

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:45.868
IN THE ISSUE OF A REFERENDUM

01:01:45.935 --> 01:01:47.403
IT'S EXACTLY OPPOSITE. THE

01:01:47.470 --> 01:01:49.605
PROPONENTS ONE I YES I MEAN THE

01:01:49.672 --> 01:01:51.607
OPPONENTS WANNA YES BECAUSE

01:01:51.674 --> 01:01:52.608
THEY WANT TO MAINTAIN THE LAW.

01:01:52.675 --> 01:01:54.277
AND SO WE HAVE S. C. A. ONE

01:01:54.343 --> 01:01:55.411
WHICH WILL COME BEFORE THIS

01:01:55.478 --> 01:01:57.213
COMMITTEE AFTER THE INITIAL

01:01:57.280 --> 01:01:58.748
DEADLINES. AND THIS IS A

01:01:58.815 --> 01:02:00.083
COMPANION MEASURE THAT WAS

01:02:00.149 --> 01:02:02.919
BEING CARRIED. BY THEN ASSEMBLY

01:02:02.985 --> 01:02:04.353
MEMBER BONTA AND NOW THE

01:02:04.420 --> 01:02:07.323
ATTORNEY GENERAL BONTA. AND

01:02:07.390 --> 01:02:09.592
BECAUSE HE DIDN'T GO FOR YOU

01:02:09.659 --> 01:02:10.560
KNOW I WAS HE'S NOW IN A

01:02:10.626 --> 01:02:12.595
DIFFERENT JOB WE BROUGHT THAT

01:02:12.662 --> 01:02:13.830
BILL BACK TO THIS HOUSE IT WAS

01:02:13.896 --> 01:02:15.565
PART OF THAT PACKAGE I WAS KERN

01:02:15.631 --> 01:02:16.599
CONSTITUTIONAL MOMENT HE WAS

01:02:16.666 --> 01:02:18.601
CARRYING THE STATUTORY FEES.

01:02:18.668 --> 01:02:19.435
AND CENTER NEWMAN HAS BEEN

01:02:19.502 --> 01:02:21.537
GRACIOUS ENOUGH TO ALLOW US TO

01:02:21.604 --> 01:02:23.573
GIVE US HIS BILL. WHICH EVEN

01:02:23.639 --> 01:02:24.774
GOTTEN AMENDED TO BE ABLE TO

01:02:24.841 --> 01:02:26.709
PUT THOSE PROVISIONS SO. IT

01:02:26.776 --> 01:02:28.711
REALLY IS A WAY THAT IT AND THE

01:02:28.778 --> 01:02:30.913
SOLUTION IS NUMBER ONE THAT

01:02:30.980 --> 01:02:32.582
MEASURE BECAUSE THE WAY THE WAY

01:02:32.648 --> 01:02:33.616
THE COULD THE LAW CONSTITUTIONS

01:02:33.683 --> 01:02:35.017
WRITTEN IS THERE ORDERED YOU

01:02:35.084 --> 01:02:36.819
KNOW FIRST HIS INITIAL BONDS.

01:02:36.886 --> 01:02:38.121
THEN INITIATIVES BY THE

01:02:38.187 --> 01:02:40.556
LEGISLATURE PUT OFF THE OTHERS

01:02:40.623 --> 01:02:41.190
BUT PUT ON THE BALLOT AGAIN THE

01:02:41.257 --> 01:02:43.392
LAST IS. IS THE REFERENDUM THIS

01:02:43.459 --> 01:02:45.761
SAYS THAT REFERENDUMS ARE PUT

01:02:45.828 --> 01:02:47.130
ON THE BALLOT IN ORDER THAT

01:02:47.196 --> 01:02:48.331
THEY QUALIFY AND THEY'LL

01:02:48.397 --> 01:02:49.632
USUALLY NOW BE AT THE TOP

01:02:49.699 --> 01:02:51.834
BECAUSE- IF YOU'RE OVERTURNING

01:02:51.901 --> 01:02:52.802
IT THE LAW REQUIRES A REALLY

01:02:52.869 --> 01:02:54.570
QUICK. TURNAROUND IN TERMS OF

01:02:54.637 --> 01:02:55.638
GETTING YOUR SIGNATURES IN THE

01:02:55.705 --> 01:02:57.240
SECOND IT CLARIFIES THE YES

01:02:57.306 --> 01:02:58.708
VERSES YESTERDAY NO OVERSEAS

01:02:58.774 --> 01:03:00.143
NOW. I'LL TAKE THE AMENDMENTS

01:03:00.209 --> 01:03:01.177
TO THE COMMITTEE BECAUSE THAT

01:03:01.244 --> 01:03:02.211
THAT WAS PRETTY SMART WHAT YOU

01:03:02.278 --> 01:03:04.013
GUYS DID MADE CLEAR IT EASIER I

01:03:04.080 --> 01:03:07.650
APPRECIATE THAT. AND SO IT'S

01:03:07.717 --> 01:03:09.519
REALLY A BIG ISSUE IN TERMS OF

01:03:09.585 --> 01:03:10.453
YOU KNOW WE SEE THIS NOW WITH

01:03:10.520 --> 01:03:12.989
