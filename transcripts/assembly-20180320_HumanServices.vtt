00:27:43.829 --> 00:27:47.900 region:rollup2
ACROSS THE COUNTRY.

00:27:45.731 --> 00:27:50.369 region:rollup2
FEDERAL AND CALIFORNIA NUTRITION

00:27:47.900 --> 00:27:52.004 region:rollup2
LEGISLATION PROVIDE GREAT ACCESS

00:27:50.369 --> 00:27:54.006 region:rollup2
TO DRINKING WATER FOR CHILDREN

00:27:52.004 --> 00:27:55.774 region:rollup2
IN LICENSED CHILDCARE. BUT OUR

00:27:54.006 --> 00:27:57.609 region:rollup2
CONCERN IS THAT THEY IGNORE THE

00:27:55.774 --> 00:27:59.545 region:rollup2
SAFETY PIECE.

00:27:57.609 --> 00:28:02.281 region:rollup2
LEAD IS MOST TOXIC TO CHILDREN

00:27:59.545 --> 00:28:04.016 region:rollup2
UNDER AGE SIX AND EVEN MORE TO

00:28:02.281 --> 00:28:05.984 region:rollup2
CHILDREN UNDER AGE THREE.

00:28:04.016 --> 00:28:07.886 region:rollup2
THIS IS BECAUSE CHILDREN ABSORB

00:28:05.984 --> 00:28:09.588 region:rollup2
BLOOD MORE READILY.

00:28:07.886 --> 00:28:12.024 region:rollup2
AND ALSO THERE GROWING BRAINS

00:28:09.588 --> 00:28:13.725 region:rollup2
ARE MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO DAMAGE.

00:28:12.024 --> 00:28:15.861 region:rollup2
YOUNG CHILDREN CAN'T ABSORB UP

00:28:13.725 --> 00:28:18.730 region:rollup2
TO FIT FORTY TO FIFTY PERCENT OF

00:28:15.861 --> 00:28:20.065 region:rollup2
THE LEAD THAT THEY IN CHEST.

00:28:18.730 --> 00:28:21.633 region:rollup2
FORMULA FED INFANTS ARE EVEN

00:28:20.065 --> 00:28:23.368 region:rollup2
GREATER RISK.

00:28:21.633 --> 00:28:26.004 region:rollup2
THIS IS BECAUSE THEY CONSUME THE

00:28:23.368 --> 00:28:27.706 region:rollup2
MOST WATER PER BODY WEIGHT.

00:28:26.004 --> 00:28:29.841 region:rollup2
SIXTY PERCENT OF BABIES ARE

00:28:27.706 --> 00:28:31.877 region:rollup2
EXCLUSIVELY FORMULA FED AND THEY

00:28:29.841 --> 00:28:33.645 region:rollup2
DRINK UP TO FOUR CUPS OF WATER

00:28:31.877 --> 00:28:35.647 region:rollup2
PER DAY IN THEIR RECONSTITUTED

00:28:33.645 --> 00:28:37.716 region:rollup2
FORMULA.

00:28:35.647 --> 00:28:39.418 region:rollup2
FORTY TO SIXTY PERCENT OF

00:28:37.716 --> 00:28:40.886 region:rollup2
INFANTS EXPOSURE TO LEAD IS

00:28:39.418 --> 00:28:43.121 region:rollup2
THROUGH WATER USED TO MIX

00:28:40.886 --> 00:28:44.523 region:rollup2
FORMULA.

00:28:43.121 --> 00:28:46.291 region:rollup2
THERE'S ANOTHER REASON TO CARE

00:28:44.523 --> 00:28:48.126 region:rollup2
ABOUT TAP WATER SAFETY.

00:28:46.291 --> 00:28:50.262 region:rollup2
DRINKING WATER INSTEAD OF SUGARY

00:28:48.126 --> 00:28:52.197 region:rollup2
DRINKS IS A GREAT WAY TO REDUCE

00:28:50.262 --> 00:28:53.632 region:rollup2
INTAKE OF THE EMPTY CALORIES IN

00:28:52.197 --> 00:28:56.134 region:rollup2

ABOUT THEIR TAP WATER SAFETY SO

00:29:05.043 --> 00:29:09.581 region:rollup2
THAT THEY CAN DRINK.

00:29:09.581 --> 00:29:12.384 region:rollup2
WE TOUCHED WATER BEFORE IT

00:29:11.049 --> 00:29:13.919 region:rollup2

ALMOST NO TESTING OF WATER AT

THE TAP.

00:29:15.554 --> 00:29:18.991 region:rollup2

EVEN LOW LEVELS OF LEAD EXPOSURE

00:29:39.578 --> 00:29:42.748 region:rollup2
CAN REDUCE A CHILD'S IQ AND

00:29:41.179 --> 00:29:43.615 region:rollup2
COGNITIVE ABILITIES AND.

00:29:42.748 --> 00:29:45.017 region:rollup2
UNFORTUNATELY WE NOW KNOW THAT

00:29:43.615 --> 00:29:46.818 region:rollup2
THOSE.

00:29:45.017 --> 00:29:48.286 region:rollup2
THAT DAMAGE CAN LAST FOR A

AMERICA CAT ME PEDIATRICS STATES

00:29:54.559 --> 00:29:59.298 region:rollup2
THAT ONE IN FIVE CASES OF

00:29:56.028 --> 00:30:01.033 region:rollup2
CHILDHOOD. ADHD IS ATTRIBUTABLE

00:29:59.298 --> 00:30:02.334 region:rollup2
TO LEAD EXPOSURE.

00:30:01.033 --> 00:30:03.902 region:rollup2
AND SADLY CHILDREN WERE

00:30:02.334 --> 00:30:05.704 region:rollup2
MALNOURISHED ABSORBED LED MUCH

00:30:03.902 --> 00:30:07.039 region:rollup2
FASTER.

00:30:05.704 --> 00:30:09.074 region:rollup2
AND WE DO KNOW THAT EIGHTY EIGHT

00:30:07.039 --> 00:30:10.876 region:rollup2
PERCENT OF LEAD POISONED KIDS IN

00:30:09.074 --> 00:30:12.277 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA COME FROM LEAD FROM

00:30:10.876 --> 00:30:13.745 region:rollup2
LOW INCOME FAMILIES.

00:30:12.277 --> 00:30:15.747 region:rollup2
UNFORTUNATE MOST OF THESE KIDS

00:30:13.745 --> 00:30:17.716 region:rollup2
ARE NOT TESTED FOR LEAD EXPOSURE

00:30:15.747 --> 00:30:19.451 region:rollup2
SO WE DON'T REALLY HAVE A. GOOD

00:30:17.716 --> 00:30:21.787 region:rollup2
HANDLE ON THE EXTENT OF THE LEAD

00:30:19.451 --> 00:30:23.522 region:rollup2
EXPOSURE PROBLEM IN CALIFORNIA.

00:30:21.787 --> 00:30:25.157 region:rollup2
WE DO NO THAT LEAD EXPOSURE IS

00:30:23.522 --> 00:30:26.925 region:rollup2
PREVENTABLE AND WE CAN BECAUSE

00:30:25.157 --> 00:30:28.593 region:rollup2
WE CAN REMOVE LEAD.

ABOUT THE NEW ONES SO.

00:33:31.576 --> 00:33:35.380 region:rollup2
LIKELY WOULD HAVE FOR NEW PIE

00:33:59.504 --> 00:34:04.175 region:rollup2
WHY DO WE HAVE TO FOCUS UPON

ONLY CHILD CARE CENTERS?

00:34:04.175 --> 00:34:07.879 region:rollup2

FOR SMALL ARE.

00:34:19.391 --> 00:34:21.893 region:rollup2
WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT.

SEEN ALL WATER THAT. WE HAVE A

00:34:31.236 --> 00:34:33.672 region:rollup2
HIGH DEGREE OF ASSURANCE THAT IF

00:34:32.304 --> 00:34:35.840 region:rollup2
THERE'S.

00:34:33.672 --> 00:34:36.041 region:rollup2
AUG MINIMAL OF NO LEAD IN THE

00:34:35.840 --> 00:34:37.442 region:rollup2
WATER.

00:34:36.041 --> 00:34:38.977 region:rollup2
.

00:34:37.442 --> 00:34:40.445 region:rollup2
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE K. THROUGH

00:34:38.977 --> 00:34:41.546 region:rollup2
TWELVE.

00:34:40.445 --> 00:34:42.414 region:rollup2
THERE ARE STANDARDS THAT ARE IN

00:34:41.546 --> 00:34:44.416 region:rollup2
PLACE.

00:34:42.414 --> 00:34:46.785 region:rollup2
TESTING.

00:34:44.416 --> 00:34:49.554 region:rollup2
THERE ARE NONE CURRENTLY AS IT

00:34:46.785 --> 00:34:50.288 region:rollup2
RELATES TO CHILDCARE CENTERS.

00:34:49.554 --> 00:34:51.957 region:rollup2
THERE ARE OVER SEVEN HUNDRED

00:34:50.288 --> 00:34:52.757 region:rollup2
THOUSAND CHILDREN WHO WERE IN

00:34:51.957 --> 00:34:54.659 region:rollup2
CHILDCARE CENTERS.

00:34:52.757 --> 00:34:56.861 region:rollup2
EVERYDAY.

00:34:54.659 --> 00:34:58.363 region:rollup2
AND TO THE EXTENT THAT WE CAN DO

00:34:56.861 --> 00:35:00.398 region:rollup2
SOMETHING TO ADDRESS.

00:34:58.363 --> 00:35:02.701 region:rollup2
CURRENT CONDITIONS AND MAKING

00:35:00.398 --> 00:35:05.036 region:rollup2
SURE THAT IF THERE IS LED.

00:35:02.701 --> 00:35:06.705 region:rollup2
THAT WE IN THE WATER THAT WE ARE

00:35:05.036 --> 00:35:09.040 region:rollup2
RECOGNIZING THAT AND THEN WE CAN

00:35:06.705 --> 00:35:10.608 region:rollup2
START A PROCESS OF REMEDIATION.

00:35:09.040 --> 00:35:12.310 region:rollup2
AND SO IT'S A APPROPRIATE NEXT

00:35:10.608 --> 00:35:13.645 region:rollup2
STEP.

00:35:12.310 --> 00:35:15.513 region:rollup2
WHEN YOU MENTION OVER

00:35:13.645 --> 00:35:17.182 region:rollup2
REGULATION I THINK THAT'S THE

00:35:15.513 --> 00:35:19.551 region:rollup2
REASON FOR THIS BILL THERE IS.

00:35:17.182 --> 00:35:22.120 region:rollup2
NO REGULATION CURRENTLY TO

00:35:19.551 --> 00:35:24.456 region:rollup2

00:35:22.120 --> 00:35:25.090 region:rollup2

.

00:35:27.125 --> 00:35:30.028 region:rollup2
NO THAT'S GREAT IF THEY'RE BEING

00:35:28.393 --> 00:35:31.529 region:rollup2
BUILT AND YOU'RE RIGHT THEY

00:35:30.028 --> 00:35:33.164 region:rollup2
WOULD BE.

00:35:31.529 --> 00:35:35.266 region:rollup2
BILL TO CERTAIN STANDARDS THAT.

00:35:33.164 --> 00:35:37.235 region:rollup2
YOU WOULD ASSUME WOULD HAVE ALL

00:35:35.266 --> 00:35:39.170 region:rollup2
OF THE. OUR PROTOCOLS IN PLACE

00:35:37.235 --> 00:35:40.538 region:rollup2
TO ENSURE THAT.

00:35:39.170 --> 00:35:42.140 region:rollup2
LET US CAP OF THE WATER BUT TO

00:35:40.538 --> 00:35:45.076 region:rollup2
THE EXTENT THAT.

00:35:42.140 --> 00:35:46.678 region:rollup2
THAT COULD EVEN BE LEACHED AND.

00:35:45.076 --> 00:35:48.313 region:rollup2
OUT SOMEHOW WE JUST WANT TO MAKE

00:35:46.678 --> 00:35:49.614 region:rollup2
SURE THAT PARENTS AND TEACHERS

WHETHER THEIR CHILDREN ARE AT AN

00:35:55.920 --> 00:36:00.158 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENT WHERE THERE'S OF

00:35:57.722 --> 00:36:01.459 region:rollup2
POTENTIAL FOR A LEAD TO LEACH

INTO THE WATER SYSTEM THEREBY

00:36:01.459 --> 00:36:04.662 region:rollup2
CREATING.

00:36:02.794 --> 00:36:06.631 region:rollup2
THESE KIND OF HARMFUL SAFETY

KEEP HIM SAFE AND SO WE THINK

00:36:12.103 --> 00:36:15.807 region:rollup2
THIS IS APPROPRIATE STEP WE

00:36:14.039 --> 00:36:18.376 region:rollup2

00:36:42.133 --> 00:36:46.104 region:rollup2
CHILDREN'S SAFETY IS A FORMER SO

00:36:43.868 --> 00:36:47.205 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW MORE IMPORTANT TO OUR

00:36:46.104 --> 00:36:48.473 region:rollup2
CHILDREN ABOUT A LOT MORE I

00:36:47.205 --> 00:36:51.576 region:rollup2
THINK YOU DECIDE HOW WE CAN

00:36:48.473 --> 00:36:54.112 region:rollup2
COMPROMISE SO. HOW OFTEN THE

00:36:51.576 --> 00:36:55.914 region:rollup2
WATER HAS TO BE TESTED THE FOR

00:36:54.112 --> 00:36:57.215 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE?

00:36:55.914 --> 00:36:59.050 region:rollup2
IF NOT BE EVERY MONTH I EVERY

00:36:57.215 --> 00:36:59.517 region:rollup2
SIX MONTHS EVERY YEAR WITH TWO

00:36:59.050 --> 00:37:00.051 region:rollup2
YEARS OF THREE YEARS.

00:36:59.517 --> 00:37:01.286 region:rollup2
IF AND WHEN THAT THE WATER

00:37:00.051 --> 00:37:04.322 region:rollup2
LEVEL.

00:37:01.286 --> 00:37:05.590 region:rollup2
DID LEAD LEVEL IS SO HIGH IT AN

00:37:04.322 --> 00:37:07.559 region:rollup2
ARE. OF THE QUIET THOSE

00:37:05.590 --> 00:37:09.894 region:rollup2
STANDARDS ARE THEN. A WILL THERE

00:37:07.559 --> 00:37:13.364 region:rollup2
BE ANY SUBSTITUTE ON THE KEBAB

00:37:09.894 --> 00:37:16.835 region:rollup2
INTO WATER O.. O. WALK TEND

00:37:13.364 --> 00:37:19.571 region:rollup2
WATER WHATEVER CAN BE PROVIDED

00:37:16.835 --> 00:37:23.775 region:rollup2
TO INSTEAD OF A TABLET WE HAVE

00:37:19.571 --> 00:37:24.008 region:rollup2
TO SPEAK ABOUT THE TAP WATER YOU

00:37:23.775 --> 00:37:24.876 region:rollup2
RIGHT.

00:37:24.008 --> 00:37:25.677 region:rollup2
YES.

00:37:24.876 --> 00:37:26.311 region:rollup2
IF I IF I MA'AM SUSAN LITTLE

00:37:25.677 --> 00:37:27.445 region:rollup2
AGAIN WITH ENVIRONMENTAL WORKING

00:37:26.311 --> 00:37:28.046 region:rollup2
GROUP SO. I'D NATIONWIDE THERE'S

00:37:27.445 --> 00:37:29.180 region:rollup2
MEANT ABOUT SIX OTHER STATES

00:37:28.046 --> 00:37:30.682 region:rollup2
THAT HAVE BEEN IMPOSED.

00:37:29.180 --> 00:37:32.016 region:rollup2
DRINKING WATER TESTING STANDARDS

00:37:30.682 --> 00:37:34.452 region:rollup2
ON CHILDCARE CENTERS AND

00:37:32.016 --> 00:37:36.988 region:rollup2
FACILITIES. AND THOSE STANDARDS

00:37:34.452 --> 00:37:38.690 region:rollup2
TYPICALLY REQUIRED RETESTING

00:37:36.988 --> 00:37:40.925 region:rollup2
ABOUT EVERY SIX YEARS.

00:37:38.690 --> 00:37:43.261 region:rollup2
EVERY CITY EVERY SIX YEARS AND

00:37:40.925 --> 00:37:44.095 region:rollup2
THIS IS A BILL TO ME.

00:37:43.261 --> 00:37:46.631 region:rollup2
I'M SORRY  <u><c.green>I FEAR OBVIOUS</c></u>

00:37:44.095 --> 00:37:48.800 region:rollup2
YURI'S ABOUT IT THAT HAS TO BE A

00:37:46.631 --> 00:37:50.935 region:rollup2
EVERY YEAR AND SIX YEARS HIS SON

00:37:48.800 --> 00:37:52.270 region:rollup2
IN ROME POP CAN HAVE A RUSHED TO

00:37:50.935 --> 00:37:56.574 region:rollup2
WALK ON THAT LEVEL. YOU KNOW WHY

00:37:52.270 --> 00:37:58.309 region:rollup2
NOT EVERY YEAR HERE AND THEN.

00:37:56.574 --> 00:37:59.544 region:rollup2
I'LL LET.

00:37:58.309 --> 00:38:01.079 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT THE WATER.

00:37:59.544 --> 00:38:02.514 region:rollup2
SUPPLY WETA TAP WATER OF

00:38:01.079 --> 00:38:03.648 region:rollup2
WHATEVER THAT WATER IS TIPPING

00:38:02.514 --> 00:38:05.784 region:rollup2
PEOPLE BEING.

00:38:03.648 --> 00:38:07.886 region:rollup2
PROVIDED TO CHILDREN CAN BE

00:38:05.784 --> 00:38:09.954 region:rollup2
TESTED THAT IF THAT THE LEVEL IS

00:38:07.886 --> 00:38:10.955 region:rollup2
ABOVE FLOOD AND SUBSTITUTE A

00:38:09.954 --> 00:38:12.323 region:rollup2
RATHER THAN.

00:38:10.955 --> 00:38:14.726 region:rollup2
RATHER THAN.

00:38:12.323 --> 00:38:16.561 region:rollup2
DE CHILD CARE CENTER PERMIT

00:38:14.726 --> 00:38:17.662 region:rollup2
THIS OUT FOR.

00:38:16.561 --> 00:38:19.497 region:rollup2
WOULD BE DEPENDING UPON THE TAP

00:38:17.662 --> 00:38:21.666 region:rollup2
WATER.

00:38:19.497 --> 00:38:23.168 region:rollup2
SO I INTO A BIG POTAWATOMI AGAIN

00:38:21.666 --> 00:38:24.702 region:rollup2
IN I THINK INTRIGUED OUT OF WHAT

00:38:23.168 --> 00:38:28.072 region:rollup2
WHICH WOULD BE MUCH MUCH CHEAPER

00:38:24.702 --> 00:38:29.974 region:rollup2
AND A. LOT EASIER OF FOR TALK

00:38:28.072 --> 00:38:32.977 region:rollup2
CARE CENTERS TO MAINTAIN AND

00:38:29.974 --> 00:38:34.479 region:rollup2
OPERATE THE AND ON NEWLY OPENED.

00:38:32.977 --> 00:38:36.247 region:rollup2
NUMBER ONE THING THAT THE BILL

00:38:34.479 --> 00:38:38.082 region:rollup2
SPECIFICALLY ARM.

00:38:36.247 --> 00:38:38.950 region:rollup2
DEFERS TO THE DEPARTMENT SOCIAL

00:38:38.082 --> 00:38:40.451 region:rollup2
SERVICES AND THE WATER BOARD TO

00:38:38.950 --> 00:38:42.620 region:rollup2
DEVELOP.

00:38:40.451 --> 00:38:44.489 region:rollup2
DECIDE HOW IT'S GOING TO BE THAT

00:38:42.620 --> 00:38:45.957 region:rollup2
THAT CHILDHOOD LEAD TESTING

00:38:44.489 --> 00:38:47.058 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENT WILL BE CARRIED OUT.

00:38:45.957 --> 00:38:49.027 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THERE ARE ALL THESE

00:38:47.058 --> 00:38:50.061 region:rollup2
SPECIFIC CONCERNS AMONG

00:38:49.027 --> 00:38:51.563 region:rollup2
STAKEHOLDERS AS TO HOW IT'LL

00:38:50.061 --> 00:38:53.932 region:rollup2
HAPPEN.

00:38:51.563 --> 00:38:56.000 region:rollup2
AND WE FELT THAT IT WAS BEST TO.

00:38:53.932 --> 00:38:57.402 region:rollup2
TO LEAVE THAT DECISION MAKING UP

00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:59.871 region:rollup2
TO THE AGENCIES.

00:38:57.402 --> 00:39:01.472 region:rollup2
WHO KNOW BEST REALLY HOW TO DO?

00:38:59.871 --> 00:39:03.274 region:rollup2
THE MOST EFFICIENT WATER

00:39:01.472 --> 00:39:04.709 region:rollup2
TESTING AND THIS AND THIS WAY IN

00:39:03.274 --> 00:39:06.311 region:rollup2
THIS WAY FOR THESE FACILITIES

00:39:04.709 --> 00:39:07.712 region:rollup2
ONE THING TO POINT OUT IS THAT

00:39:06.311 --> 00:39:08.246 region:rollup2
CHILDCARE CENTERS RIGHT NOW

00:39:07.712 --> 00:39:10.715 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY IF THERE'S OWN

00:39:08.246 --> 00:39:12.784 region:rollup2
COMMERCIAL. THERE IS NO TAP

00:39:10.715 --> 00:39:14.886 region:rollup2
WATER TESTING OF THOSE CENTERS

00:39:12.784 --> 00:39:16.688 region:rollup2
ON THERE IS SPORADIC TESTING OF

00:39:14.886 --> 00:39:17.922 region:rollup2
HOMES THEIR STUDENT LEAD AND

00:39:16.688 --> 00:39:20.058 region:rollup2
COPPER RULE.

00:39:17.922 --> 00:39:21.392 region:rollup2
ENFORCEMENT BUT.

00:39:20.058 --> 00:39:23.595 region:rollup2
THEY'RE BASICALLY OFF THE GRID

00:39:21.392 --> 00:39:25.196 region:rollup2
IN TERMS OF WATER TESTING FROM

00:39:23.595 --> 00:39:27.332 region:rollup2
INSIDE THE FACILITIES RIGHT NOW

00:39:25.196 --> 00:39:28.766 region:rollup2
SO THAT IS WHY. WE FEEL LIKE

00:39:27.332 --> 00:39:31.269 region:rollup2
THIS IS A PRETTY URGENT MATTER

00:39:28.766 --> 00:39:32.237 region:rollup2
TO BRING FORWARD.

00:39:31.269 --> 00:39:34.539 region:rollup2
SO WHAT'S GOING ON NINE TO TALK

00:39:32.237 --> 00:39:37.408 region:rollup2
THIS OUT LEFT LEVEL OF A CHILD

00:39:34.539 --> 00:39:38.476 region:rollup2
CARE LICENSING HOSPITALS ARE

00:39:37.408 --> 00:39:40.311 region:rollup2
SERVICES THAT WOULD PULL OUT OUR

00:39:38.476 --> 00:39:41.746 region:rollup2
EVERY EVERY. ONCE IN EVERY SIX

00:39:40.311 --> 00:39:43.381 region:rollup2
YEARS WE HAVE THE BILL

00:39:41.746 --> 00:39:45.116 region:rollup2
SPECIFICALLY SAYS ONE AT LEAST

00:39:43.381 --> 00:39:49.487 region:rollup2
EVERY FIVE YEARS AFTER THE

00:39:45.116 --> 00:39:49.787 region:rollup2
INITIAL ROUND OF TESTING BUT. IT

00:39:49.487 --> 00:39:50.255 region:rollup2
LEAVES OPEN.

00:39:49.787 --> 00:39:50.822 region:rollup2
.

00:39:50.255 --> 00:39:52.156 region:rollup2
IT LEAVES OUT OPEN TO THE

00:39:50.822 --> 00:39:55.493 region:rollup2
AGENCY'S DECIDE HOW TO BEST

00:39:52.156 --> 00:39:57.962 region:rollup2
PROCEED.

00:39:55.493 --> 00:39:59.831 region:rollup2
NOW IS THERE ANY DESIRE THAT NO

00:39:57.962 --> 00:40:01.032 region:rollup2
AFFECT AND.

00:39:59.831 --> 00:40:03.101 region:rollup2
.

00:40:01.032 --> 00:40:05.503 region:rollup2
A MAN DEL REQUIREMENT THE WHAT

00:40:03.101 --> 00:40:07.438 region:rollup2
ABOUT DRINKING WATER SUPPLY

00:40:05.503 --> 00:40:09.007 region:rollup2
RATHER THAN TAP WATER JUST A

00:40:07.438 --> 00:40:11.609 region:rollup2
FIXED TERRA.

00:40:09.007 --> 00:40:12.543 region:rollup2
WOULD A FIXTURE. A SHALL MEET

00:40:11.609 --> 00:40:14.512 region:rollup2
THAT REQUIREMENT THAT.

00:40:12.543 --> 00:40:16.648 region:rollup2
I MEAN.

00:40:14.512 --> 00:40:18.383 region:rollup2
DID THE WATER PIPE BY OPERATION

00:40:16.648 --> 00:40:19.884 region:rollup2
IF THE BIDDING HAPPENS TO BE OLD

00:40:18.383 --> 00:40:21.319 region:rollup2
ONE THAT CAN BE A LOT COSTA DEBT

00:40:19.884 --> 00:40:22.687 region:rollup2
THAN.

00:40:21.319 --> 00:40:23.521 region:rollup2
IN A BIG WATER BOTTLE THAT

00:40:22.687 --> 00:40:25.590 region:rollup2
EVERYBODY CAN DRINK OUT ABOUT

00:40:23.521 --> 00:40:26.658 region:rollup2
WHAT WAS SOME OF THE OPTIONS

00:40:25.590 --> 00:40:27.692 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD BE AVAILABLE TO

00:40:26.658 --> 00:40:29.527 region:rollup2
CENTER WOULD BE FOR INSTANCE A

00:40:27.692 --> 00:40:31.629 region:rollup2
FILTER BECAUSE FILTERS CAN.

00:40:29.527 --> 00:40:33.631 region:rollup2
FILTER OUT LEAD FAIRLY EASILY.

00:40:31.629 --> 00:40:35.566 region:rollup2
.

00:40:33.631 --> 00:40:36.634 region:rollup2
AND AGAIN THAT'S PART.

00:40:35.566 --> 00:40:37.535 region:rollup2
THE THE REQUIREMENT WOULD BE

00:40:36.634 --> 00:40:39.404 region:rollup2
THAT THE CHILDREN HAVE TO BE

00:40:37.535 --> 00:40:40.872 region:rollup2
PROVIDED SAFE IMPOSSIBLE AND

00:40:39.404 --> 00:40:43.074 region:rollup2
LEAD FREE WATER.

00:40:40.872 --> 00:40:44.943 region:rollup2
AND SO IF THERE HAS TO BE STOP

00:40:43.074 --> 00:40:45.977 region:rollup2
GAP MEASURES AVAILABLE TO THE

00:40:44.943 --> 00:40:47.478 region:rollup2
CHILDCARE FACILITIES CHILD CARE

00:40:45.977 --> 00:40:48.947 region:rollup2
CENTERS.

00:40:47.478 --> 00:40:50.081 region:rollup2
THEN THAT WOULD OBVIOUSLY THAT

00:40:48.947 --> 00:40:51.816 region:rollup2
WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT THE

00:40:50.081 --> 00:40:53.818 region:rollup2
AGENCIES COULD.

00:40:51.816 --> 00:40:55.320 region:rollup2
COULD INCLUDE IN THE REGULATION.

00:40:53.818 --> 00:40:56.854 region:rollup2
YEAH AVAILABLE OPTION THAT HALL

00:40:55.320 --> 00:40:57.789 region:rollup2
AVAILABLE LOOK A LOWER COST

00:40:56.854 --> 00:40:59.824 region:rollup2
AVAILABLE OPTION IF THERE'S A

00:40:57.789 --> 00:41:01.459 region:rollup2
PLUMBING PROBLEM MORE EXPENSIVE

00:40:59.824 --> 00:41:02.193 region:rollup2
PROBLEM THEN THAT WOULD BE A

00:41:01.459 --> 00:41:03.161 region:rollup2
STOP GAP.

00:41:02.193 --> 00:41:05.396 region:rollup2
OPTION.

00:41:03.161 --> 00:41:07.231 region:rollup2
THERE IS ALSO ON THIS AVAILABLE

00:41:05.396 --> 00:41:09.133 region:rollup2
FUND THAT WE MADE AVAILABLE FOR

00:41:07.231 --> 00:41:11.002 region:rollup2
THE FACILITIES TO USED UP TO.

00:41:09.133 --> 00:41:13.204 region:rollup2
ARM.

00:41:11.002 --> 00:41:14.539 region:rollup2
TO EMPLOYEE TO.

00:41:13.204 --> 00:41:16.007 region:rollup2
UPGRADE THEIR DRINKING WATER

00:41:14.539 --> 00:41:17.408 region:rollup2
SYSTEMS OF THAT'S WHAT THEY NEED

00:41:16.007 --> 00:41:19.644 region:rollup2
IF THAT'S IF THAT IF THEY CAN

00:41:17.408 --> 00:41:21.512 region:rollup2
DEMONSTRATE AND THE AS THEY

00:41:19.644 --> 00:41:22.113 region:rollup2
WOULD PROVIDE THAT THE. SURE

00:41:21.512 --> 00:41:23.881 region:rollup2
KNOW THE.

00:41:22.113 --> 00:41:25.817 region:rollup2
THERE IS EXIT THERE'S AN

00:41:23.881 --> 00:41:27.085 region:rollup2
EXISTING POT OF MONEY THAT HAS

00:41:25.817 --> 00:41:29.153 region:rollup2
NOT BEEN UTILIZED IT'S FOR

00:41:27.085 --> 00:41:30.355 region:rollup2
CHILDCARE FACILITIES TO USE TO

00:41:29.153 --> 00:41:31.823 region:rollup2
UPGRADE.

00:41:30.355 --> 00:41:33.725 region:rollup2
THEIR FACILITIES AND THIS WOULD

00:41:31.823 --> 00:41:35.660 region:rollup2
SPECIFIC SPECIFIED THAT THE

00:41:33.725 --> 00:41:37.161 region:rollup2
CENTERS CAN USE THAT NO INTEREST

00:41:35.660 --> 00:41:40.098 region:rollup2
LOAN PROGRAM.

00:41:37.161 --> 00:41:43.034 region:rollup2
TO PAY FOR THEIR UPGRADES.

00:41:40.098 --> 00:41:45.536 region:rollup2
IT WOULD BE ALONE IT'S A LOAN.

00:41:43.034 --> 00:41:47.672 region:rollup2
ONLY MY CONCERN IS THAT. BECAUSE

00:41:45.536 --> 00:41:49.107 region:rollup2
OF THEIR WELL WE ALL KNOW THAT

00:41:47.672 --> 00:41:51.576 region:rollup2
THAT THERE IS A SHORTAGE UP

00:41:49.107 --> 00:41:52.810 region:rollup2
ATTACK GET CENTER SO. AWESOME

00:41:51.576 --> 00:41:54.645 region:rollup2
AND AND AND AND I DON'T BURDEN

00:41:52.810 --> 00:41:59.117 region:rollup2
BECAUSE HER REGULATIONS HAVE%

00:41:54.645 --> 00:42:00.551 region:rollup2
WATER ORDERS JUST SO IN AWE

00:41:59.117 --> 00:42:01.185 region:rollup2
CREATE HUMBLE PROBLEMS.

00:42:00.551 --> 00:42:01.753 region:rollup2
OUR OBJECT THANK YOU THANK YOU

LAST YEAR FOR LEAD TESTING IN

00:42:08.092 --> 00:42:11.829 region:rollup2
SCHOOLS ARE BECAUSE WE SAW A

00:42:10.428 --> 00:42:12.864 region:rollup2
PROBLEM IN SAN DIEGO AND SO I

ANALYSIS FROM THE COMMITTEE.

01:13:45.855 --> 01:13:49.659 region:rollup2
AT THE VERY BOTTOM THERE'S A

01:13:47.056 --> 01:13:51.627 region:rollup2
QUESTION ABOUT. HOW THIS BILL

01:13:49.659 --> 01:13:53.195 region:rollup2
WILL INTERACT WITH THE CURRENT

01:13:51.627 --> 01:13:55.264 region:rollup2
RATE STUDY THAT THE DEPARTMENT

01:13:53.195 --> 01:13:56.832 region:rollup2

WOULD HAVE ON. THAT RATE STUDY.

01:14:01.470 --> 01:14:03.639 region:rollup2
WELL THE BILL ACTUALLY WOULDN'T

01:14:02.505 --> 01:14:05.308 region:rollup2
HAVE ANY EFFECT ON THE RATE

01:14:03.639 --> 01:14:06.475 region:rollup2
STUDY IF THE RATE STUDY COMES

01:14:05.308 --> 01:14:07.643 region:rollup2
OUT AND THERE'S A NEED AND

01:14:06.475 --> 01:14:09.378 region:rollup2
THERE'S AND THERE'S ACTUALLY

01:14:07.643 --> 01:14:10.880 region:rollup2
ACTION ON THE ON IT INCREASED

01:14:09.378 --> 01:14:11.948 region:rollup2
RATES. IT'S JUST GOING TO MAKE

01:14:10.880 --> 01:14:13.049 region:rollup2
IT THAT MUCH SIMPLER FOR THE

01:14:11.948 --> 01:14:14.550 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT TO BE ABLE TO

01:14:13.049 --> 01:14:16.085 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENT BECAUSE THEY THE RATES

01:14:14.550 --> 01:14:17.086 region:rollup2
ARE GOING TO MINIMIZE THE NUMBER

01:14:16.085 --> 01:14:19.689 region:rollup2
OF REQUESTS THAT ARE COMING

01:14:17.086 --> 01:14:21.257 region:rollup2

01:14:19.689 --> 01:14:23.025 region:rollup2
THAT THEY'LL HAVE SOME SYSTEMS

01:14:21.257 --> 01:14:25.428 region:rollup2
IN PLACE BY THE TIME THAT RATE

01:14:23.025 --> 01:14:26.996 region:rollup2
STUDY IS COMPLETED WERE. GETTING

01:14:25.428 --> 01:14:28.464 region:rollup2
AHEAD OF A SERIOUS ISSUE RIGHT

01:14:26.996 --> 01:14:29.932 region:rollup2
NOW THAT IS REALLY IMPACTING THE

01:14:28.464 --> 01:14:31.033 region:rollup2
YET DEVELOPMENTALLY DISABLED

01:14:29.932 --> 01:14:32.668 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY.

01:14:31.033 --> 01:14:33.903 region:rollup2

I'M THAT THE CONSUMERS ARE NOT

01:14:33.903 --> 01:14:36.572 region:rollup2
AFFECTED ADVERSELY.

01:14:35.538 --> 01:14:38.240 region:rollup2
AND THEN IF WE WAIT FOR THE

01:14:36.572 --> 01:14:39.809 region:rollup2
RATE STUDY WHICH IS GONNA TELL

01:14:38.240 --> 01:14:41.310 region:rollup2
US WHAT'S ALREADY PRETTY EVIDENT

01:14:39.809 --> 01:14:42.745 region:rollup2
IN THE IF IN THE ISSUE BUT A

01:14:41.310 --> 01:14:44.246 region:rollup2
WHAT THERE'S NO IN A CONFLICT

01:14:42.745 --> 01:14:46.148 region:rollup2
BETWEEN THE TWO AS A MATTER FACT

01:14:44.246 --> 01:14:46.449 region:rollup2
DIFFERENTLY COMPLEMENTARY. SO I

01:14:46.148 --> 01:14:47.249 region:rollup2
GUESS SOME.

01:14:46.449 --> 01:14:49.352 region:rollup2
.

01:14:47.249 --> 01:14:50.519 region:rollup2

THIRD DO TIME TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:14:56.726 --> 01:14:59.862 region:rollup2
THE RATE STUDY COMES BACK AND

01:14:57.760 --> 01:15:02.098 region:rollup2
I'M. TRYING TO WONDER IF THIS

01:14:59.862 --> 01:15:03.599 region:rollup2
OBSCURES THE INFORMATION THAT

01:15:02.098 --> 01:15:05.468 region:rollup2
THEY'VE BEEN COLLECTING AND IS

01:15:03.599 --> 01:15:07.670 region:rollup2
THERE. ANYTHING WITHIN THIS BILL

01:15:05.468 --> 01:15:10.106 region:rollup2
THAT. WILL MAKE IT HARDER TO GET

01:15:07.670 --> 01:15:11.507 region:rollup2
AN ACCURATE ASSESSMENT OF WHAT'S

01:15:10.106 --> 01:15:13.509 region:rollup2
HAPPENING ON THE GROUND LEVEL I

01:15:11.507 --> 01:15:14.710 region:rollup2
I SHARE YOUR CONCERNS FOR MAKING

INFORMATION SO THAT WE CAN.

01:15:21.584 --> 01:15:25.888 region:rollup2
MAKE APPROPRIATE DECISIONS.

01:15:24.420 --> 01:15:27.456 region:rollup2
WELLED UP LET'S LET ME START BY

01:15:25.888 --> 01:15:28.357 region:rollup2
SAYING I DON'T BELIEVE THAT

01:15:27.456 --> 01:15:29.158 region:rollup2
THERE'S ANYTHING IN THE BILL

01:15:28.357 --> 01:15:31.293 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD BE YOU KNOW

01:15:29.158 --> 01:15:32.862 region:rollup2
DETRIMENTAL TO THAT PROCESS.

SITTING THERE TRYING TO EXTEND.

WE'RE.

01:16:35.057 --> 01:16:39.462 region:rollup2
WELL I CERTAINLY YOU KNOW THERE

01:16:36.959 --> 01:16:41.397 region:rollup2
THERE COULD BE A AN AMENDMENT TO

01:16:39.462 --> 01:16:43.799 region:rollup2
THE CAP THE NUMBER OF. YOU KNOW

01:16:41.397 --> 01:16:45.334 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITIES FOR DDS TO MAKE

01:16:43.799 --> 01:16:46.268 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL THIRTY DAY REQUESTS I

01:16:45.334 --> 01:16:47.403 region:rollup2
I DON'T KNOW IF THIS BUT THIS

01:16:46.268 --> 01:16:48.804 region:rollup2
POINT THE OTHERS INTERESTED IN

01:16:47.403 --> 01:16:50.306 region:rollup2
TAKING SUCH AN AMENDMENT BUT

01:16:48.804 --> 01:16:51.941 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD BE ONE WAY TO ENSURE.

01:16:50.306 --> 01:16:53.476 region:rollup2
I MEAN THE PROBLEM NOW IS THAT

01:16:51.941 --> 01:16:55.010 region:rollup2
THERE IS AN UNDEFINED AMOUNT OF

01:16:53.476 --> 01:16:55.911 region:rollup2
TIME THAT THEY CAN TAKE THE

01:16:55.010 --> 01:16:57.446 region:rollup2
NUMBER I REFERENCED EARLIER

01:16:55.911 --> 01:16:58.314 region:rollup2
DOESN'T EVEN TAKE INTO ACCOUNT

01:16:57.446 --> 01:16:59.882 region:rollup2
THE TIME REGIONAL CENTERS ARE

01:16:58.314 --> 01:17:01.484 region:rollup2
PROCESS IN THEIR QUEST THAT'S

01:16:59.882 --> 01:17:02.952 region:rollup2
JUST THE TIME. FROM WHICH DTS

01:17:01.484 --> 01:17:03.953 region:rollup2
FOR RECEIVES THE REQUEST AND

01:17:02.952 --> 01:17:05.354 region:rollup2
TRIES TO MAKE A DECISION ON IT

01:17:03.953 --> 01:17:06.689 region:rollup2
SO I THINK IT'S A GREAT FIRST

01:17:05.354 --> 01:17:08.057 region:rollup2
STEP IN AT LEAST PUTTING SOME

01:17:06.689 --> 01:17:09.925 region:rollup2
SORT OF TIME FRAME ON WHEN WE

01:17:08.057 --> 01:17:10.426 region:rollup2
WOULD EXPECT A DECISION TO BE

01:17:09.925 --> 01:17:11.760 region:rollup2
MADE BY DTS.

01:17:10.426 --> 01:17:14.029 region:rollup2

SAFETY WAIVERS AT THIS.

01:17:20.736 --> 01:17:24.840 region:rollup2
PER OF THIS PROCESS WAS

01:17:22.137 --> 01:17:26.308 region:rollup2
ESTABLISHED TO. DO TAKES CARE OF

HEALTH AND SAFETY WAIVERS

01:17:27.610 --> 01:17:30.913 region:rollup2
APPROVED QUICKLY AND RIGHT NOW

01:17:29.578 --> 01:17:32.515 region:rollup2
IT'S HAPPINESS AT BEING SO

LIKE LOCAL MINIMUM WAGE. THAT'S

01:17:35.918 --> 01:17:39.822 region:rollup2
NOT HAPPENING SO THAT'S A REAL

01:17:37.019 --> 01:17:41.123 region:rollup2
PRIORITY OF THIS EFFORT AND AS

01:17:39.822 --> 01:17:43.292 region:rollup2
WELL TO COME UP WITH THE

01:17:41.123 --> 01:17:45.094 region:rollup2
ALTERNATIVE WAY TO DEAL WITH

01:17:43.292 --> 01:17:47.396 region:rollup2
THESE ISSUES LIKE ARM LOCAL

INADEQUACY IS A CHOICE HAS BEEN

01:34:39.507 --> 01:34:42.477 region:rollup2
MADE BY CONGRESS AND WE'RE HERE

01:34:41.442 --> 01:34:44.979 region:rollup2
TODAY ASKING THE STATE OF

CALIFORNIA TO CONSIDER REVERSING

01:34:44.979 --> 01:34:47.649 region:rollup2
WHAT WAS KNOWN AS THE HUNGER

01:34:45.713 --> 01:34:49.017 region:rollup2
CLIFF IN TWENTY THIRTEEN. AND

01:34:47.649 --> 01:34:51.252 region:rollup2
RESTORE THOSE BENEFITS THAT WERE

01:34:49.017 --> 01:34:52.020 region:rollup2

GOALS THAT WE CAN ALL SUPPORT

01:34:56.591 --> 01:34:59.127 region:rollup2

01:34:58.126 --> 01:35:00.295 region:rollup2
OF THAT AND I WOULD JUST MAKE

01:34:59.127 --> 01:35:02.030 region:rollup2
TWO. TWO POINTS.

01:35:00.295 --> 01:35:03.965 region:rollup2
WHICH IS THAT THIS IF WE DON'T

01:35:02.030 --> 01:35:05.400 region:rollup2
DO THIS THIS COMES WITH CERTAIN

01:35:03.965 --> 01:35:07.435 region:rollup2
COSTS TO OUR STATE.

01:35:05.400 --> 01:35:08.970 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S BECAUSE WHAT HAPPENS

01:35:07.435 --> 01:35:10.371 region:rollup2
IS THAT FOLKS ARE COMING TO FOOD

01:35:08.970 --> 01:35:11.773 region:rollup2

TIME THAT THIS IS HAPPENING

01:35:12.373 --> 01:35:16.144 region:rollup2
EVERY MONTH. AND THAT MEANS THAT

01:35:14.475 --> 01:35:17.645 region:rollup2
FUNDAMENTALLY THERE'S UNMET NEED

01:35:16.144 --> 01:35:19.314 region:rollup2
