COMMITTEE ON ELECTIONS AND CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS -- WE'RE TO CONVENE A SUBCOMMITTEE OF THANK YOU SENATOR LEYVA. AND FIRST OF FIRST UP IS A. B. N. THIRTY SIX BY SOMEONE I WORK CURRY [inaudible] GOOD MORNING. MISTER CHAIR MEMBER AND MEMBER. I WILL START BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEEAMENDMENT TO PERMIT RATHER THAN REQUIRE THE SECRETARY OF STATE TO ADMINISTER A NEW VOTER OUT REACH GRANT PROGRAM. EVERY EFFORT WE MAKE TO REDUCE BARRIERS BETWEEN LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IN UNDER REPRESENTED COMMUNITIES WILL ENCOURAGE FULLER PARTICIPATION IN OUR DEMOCRACY. INCLUDING THE CENSUS. AB TEN THIRTY SIX WILL REDUCE BARRIERS TO THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS IN TWO WAYS. FIRST IT REQUIRES THE SECRETARY OF STATE TO UPDATE REGULATIONS DIRECTING COUNTY OFFICIALS. TO DEVELOP VOTER OUTREACH PROGRAMS. UNFORTUNATELY SOME COUNTIES HAVE VERY LOW REGISTRATION REYES IN SOME COUNTIES CLOSE 240% OF ELIGIBLE ROAD VOTERS ARE NOT REGISTERED. SECOND AB TEN THIRTY SIX CREATES A HIGH SCHOOL VOTER EDUCATION PILOT PROGRAM AND YELLOW COUNTY. THE PILOT WILL STUDY MARK ELECTIONS OF HIGH SCHOOLS AND YOLO COUNTY CONDUCTED WITH OFFICIAL OFFICIAL ELECTIONS EQUIPMENT LIKE VOTING MACHINES AND BALLOTS. THIS TYPE OF MARKET ELECTION IS EFFECTIVE FOR TEACHING YOUNGER GENERATIONS HOW TO CAST A BALLOT SO THEY ARE EXCITED INCOMPETENT WHEN THEY GO TO THEIR FIRST FULL. RATING THIS PILOT WILL LEGITIMIZE THE EFFORTS OF YOLO COUNTY AND ENSURE THE RESULTS OF THIS PROGRAM AND INFORM AND IMPROVE MOCK ELECTION STATE WISE. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE ROAD AND WE HAVE IN OF A WITNESS IN SUPPORT. AND MY ANGER I'M A SILLY OF CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT APPRECIATE THIS BILLS EFFORTS TO ENCOURAGE YOUNG PEOPLE TO GET. INSIDE AN EDUCATED ABOUT VOTING THEY'RE OFTEN UNDER REPRESENTED IN THE ELECTORATE SO GETTING THEM THE KNOWLEDGE THEY NEED TO SUCCEED EARLY ON IN VOTING WILL HELP THEM BE FULL MEMBERS OF OUR SOCIETY. THANK YOU OTHERS IN SUPPORT OPPOSITION. QUESTIONS BY THE GOAL. SO YOU SUPPORT OPPOSITION. ACTUALLY I WINNER IF YOU WILL AYE WE'RE RIGHT RUN GO WITH THE ASSOCIATION A CALIFORNIA SENSATION COURSE SELECTIONS OFFICIALS. WE ON FRIDAY TOOK A SUPPORT OF ASK THE AUTHOR TO CONSIDER. CHANGING THE LANGUAGE TO ARRIVE FOR UNDER PERFORMING COUNTIES TO CONSIDER WORKING WITH THE COUNTY IN QUESTION TO DEVELOP A PROGRAM RATHER THAN JUST FORCING A PROGRAM ON THE COUNTY THANK YOU. THANK YOU SUPPORT OPPOSITION WINNERS. COME ON UP INTEGRITY PROJECT CALIFORNIA. AND ARE WE OPPOSE A. B.. TEN THIRTY SIX OF A COUPLE OF REASONS -- ONE THAT WHILE IT IS DESIRABLE TO THOROUGHLY EDUCATE OUR CHILDREN IN THE FUNDAMENTALS OF SELF GOVERNMENT. AND THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES TO PARTICIPATE FULLY IN THE POLITICAL PROCESS AS ADULTS CITIZENS. THESE TENANTS ARE ALREADY CENTRAL G. U. S. HIGH SCHOOL IN CIVICS GOVERNMENT CLASSES BOTH REQUIRED FOR GRADUATION. ENCOURAGING TEACHERS OF SUCH COURSES TO STRENGTHEN THAT PORTION OF THE CURRICULUM IS REASONABLE AND DESIRABLE. IMPOSING ANOTHER STRUCTURE WITHIN THE SCHOOL FOR THAT PURPOSE IS NOT. WE BELIEVE THAT THE PROGRAM OUTLINED IN AB TEN THIRTY SIX WOULD INEVITABLY LEAD TO SCHOOL WIDE PRE REGISTRATION DRIVES. AND THERE'S NO PROTECTION IN A. B. TEN THIRTY SIX TO ENSURE. THAT OUR STUDENTS DO NOT BECOME VICTIMS OF PEER PRESSURE OR POLITICALLY POLITICAL INDOCTRINATION. BY A THIRTY FIGURES TO ARE LIKELY TO BE ON OR ILL TRAINED. IN THE SUBJECT THE DANGER OF SUCH DRIVES HAS ALREADY BEEN EXPOSED. AS SCHOOLS ALL OVER THE STATE HAVE REGISTERED STUDENTS WITH NO TRAINING OR KNOWLEDGE OF HOW TO PROTECT STUDENTS FROM INAPPROPRIATE PRESSURE. AND TO PROTECT THEIR PERSONAL AND PRIVATE INFORMATION. NON CITIZENS AN UNDER AGE STUDENTS ARE BEING REGISTERED AND THEREFORE HARM. THE FORMER IN YOUR VOCAL BLADE IF THEY ARE HERE LAWFULLY AND ON THE PATH TO CITIZENSHIP. A PLAN FOR USING THE SCHOOLS IN SUCH A WAY SHOULD BE APPROACHED WITH GREAT QUESTION. UNTIL PROPER AND DETAILED PLANS AND THE CURRICULUM CAN BE DEVELOPED AND TRAINING CONDUCTED. WE NEED TO SLOW DOWN FOR THE PROTECTION OF OUR CHILDREN AND IN THE MEANTIME. CALIFORNIA'S SCHOOLS NEED TO STRENGTHEN THE CIVICS GOVERNMENT CURRICULUM AND ALLOW THE EXPERTS IN THE FIELD. TO DO RIGHT BY THEIR BUDDING ADULTS THANK YOU. THERE'S OTHERS IN OPPOSITION. ALL RIGHT I'LL BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE. ELEVEN QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH IS IN ONE ASSEMBLY WOMAN I'VE ARE CURRY -- IS EXCELLENT BILL -- MOTIVATING YOUNG PEOPLE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PROCESS IT IS IS -- A VERY GOOD THANK.

BY ADDING COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY CAMPUSES AS CONSIDERATIONS FOR THE PLACEMENT OF BOTH CENTERS AND VOTERS CHOICE ACT COUNTIES. HAVING ACCESS TO BOOKS CENTER CAN EASILY RESOLVED EVERY REASON A PERSON MAY HAVE THE PREVENTS THEM FROM CASTING A BALLOT. WITH A MOVED FORGOT TO REGISTER LOS ARE BALLOT BUSY ON TUESDAYS ARE JUST ON HAVE STANCE THEY CAN ALL BE SOLVED BY VISITING ABOUT CENTER. COLLEGE CAMPUSES ARE UNIQUELY SUITED TO HOST VOTE CENTERS BECAUSE THEIR HOME TO EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY FOUR YEAR OLDS. AND AGE GROUP THAT HISTORICALLY TURNS OUT TO VOTE AT VERY LOW RATES. BUT BRING ABOUT SENATOR THEM IN MAKING THESE SERVICES READILY AVAILABLE WE CAN MAKE PROGRESS ON THE PERPLEXING CHALLENGER INCREASING TURNOUT AMONG THIS VOTING DEMOGRAPHIC. AB FIFTY NINE EMPOWERS ENGAGES YOUNG PEOPLE WHICH WILL IN TURN DECREASED THE DISPLAY DECREASES DISPROPORTIONAL REPRESENTATION VOTER TURNOUT. AND MOVE US TOWARD A MORE ACTIVE DEMOCRACY. BY SUPPORTING TESTIMONIES NOEL MORE FROM CSU SACRAMENTO AND SHOULD BE NO TANKS IN EVERGREEN DOLLARS BECAUSE COLLEGE GRADUATE AN INCOMING SOUND A STATE STUDENT. WOULD ALSO SHARE WHY IS NOT JUST.

THANK YOU AND GOOD MORNING TO A TERM BERG AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS ON MY NAME IS NO MORE I AM THE IMMEDIATE PAST PRESIDENT. OF THE ASSOCIATED STUDENTS AT SACRAMENTO STATE AS WELL AS A FORMER CULT STATE STUDENT ASSOCIATION BOARD MEMBER. I FIRST OF THE JUST LIKE TO THINK ASSEMBLY MEMBER KALRA FOR HIS LEADERSHIP ON THIS CRITICAL ISSUE OF VOTER ACCESS AND CIVIC RIGHTS. AND I'M READY TO ATTEST TO THE IMPORTANCE AND EXCITEMENT OF HAVING A VOTE CENTER ON A COLLEGE CAMPUS. I HAVE TO SAY THAT FOR STUDENTS LIKE MYSELF -- THE PRESSURES OF OF A LIFE AND PROFESSIONAL ACTIVITIES -- HAVING FIVE FULL CLASSES AND THE JOB DO START TO CATCH UP WITH YOU -- AND SIT IN FULL DISCLOSURE I ALWAYS HAD MY PARENTS DROP OFF MY BILL BY MAIL BALLOT FOR ME -- FOR THESE EXACT REASONS. SO I WANT. TO EMPHASIZE HOW I'M HAVING JUST A BREAK IN BETWEEN YOUR CLASSES OR HAVING THE EXTRA TIME AT THE END OF THE DAY. AND OF COURSE WE KNOW -- VOTE CENTERS WILL BE OPEN FOR MULTIPLE DAYS ON AT A TIME CAN MAKE ALL THE DIFFERENCE WHEN IT'S RIGHT THERE. AND IT'S WAITING FOR YOU SO THAT YOU CAN GO AND EXERCISE THIS FUNDAMENTAL CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT. THESE BOTH CENTERS PROVIDE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR STUDENTS AND CAMPUS COMMUNITY MEMBERS IN THEIR ENTIRETY TO PARTICIPATE IN EVERY SINGLE ELECTION. IT'S A COMMON SENSE APPROACH TO HAVE COUNTY ELECTIONS OFFICIALS COORDINATE ON THIS TYPE OF AN EFFORT WITH OUR PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES. HONORABLE MEMBERS. I THINK THIS IS HOW IS BEGIN TO TACKLE THE CHALLENGES RELATED TO VOTER APATHY. AND ACCESS ESPECIALLY AMONG YOUNGER VOTERS BUT AGAIN FOR AN ENTIRE CAMPUS COMMUNITY. I WANT TO MENTION THAT WE WERE ABLE TO BUILD COMMUNITY AROUND OUR VOTE CENTER AS WELL. I COULD GO ON DAYS AND DAYS WITH TALKING ABOUT WHAT WE DID BUT I'M IN AND THAT'S SINCE WE HAD STUDENT RUN ABOUT IT'S LIKE A BLACK AND BROWN VOTER SUMMIT.

ARE POINTS OF PRIDE ACTUALLY INCLUDE HAVING THE MOST SAME DAY VOTER REGISTRATIONS OF ALL VOTE CENTERS IN THE ENTIRE STATE. I'M AND BALLOTS CASTED WE ALSO HAD TWO THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED VOTE BY MAIL BALLOTS DROPPED OFF. AND YOU CAN ASK ANY OF OUR STUDENTS ARE ALSO JUST GOOGLE ALL THE NEWS REPORTS WE HAD PEOPLE THERE UNTIL CLOSE TO ELEVEN PM. POLL WORKERS WANTED TO GO HOME. BUT AGAIN UNDERSCORES -- THIS ALL UNDERSCORES THE WILLINGNESS AND EXCITEMENT THAT STUDENTS HAD AND THE COMMUNITY HAD AND I'VE SEEN THESE BENEFITS. I'M A FOR THIS TYPE OF AN ENDEAVOR FIRSTHAND THE IMPACT YOU CAN HAVE FOR THOUSANDS. AND MST IMPORTANTLY. I'VE FELT THE SHIFT IN ATTITUDES. FROM MY PEERS AND THAT IS AN INDESCRIBABLE FEELING.

I FEEL HORRIBLE FOR A BLOCKING THE MEMBER [inaudible] ON OKAY. HELLO MY NAME IS JOHN LEE JACKSON AND I'M A FOURTH YEAR AT CSU FRESNO MAJORING IN PSYCHOLOGY AND DOUBLE MINORING IN CRIMINOLOGY AND POLITICAL SCIENCE. TODAY I'M HERE REPRESENTING THE STUDENTS ARE FRESNO STATE. I'M CURRENTLY THE VICE PRESIDENT OF THE FRESNO STATE CHAPTER OF THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF COLORED PEOPLE ALSO KNOWN AS THE AND DOUBLE ACP. AS WELL AS THE NATIONAL CIVIC ENGAGEMENT TRAINER ON FOR THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION. AS A MEMBER OF MY CAMPUS AND DOUBLE ACP WITH THE SUPPORT OF OUR AND DOUBLE ACP STATE PRESIDENT ALICE HOFFMAN I STRONGLY SUPPORT. EIGHTY NINE SIXTY THREE I AM GRATEFUL TO BE ONE OF TWENTY NATIONAL CIVIC ENGAGEMENT TRAINERS FOR THE AND W. C. P.. PHYSICALLY MY EXPERIENCES IN THIS ROLE HAVE TAUGHT ME THAT STUDENTS AT FRESNO STATE ARE HUNGRY FOR CHANGE. WITHIN THE CSU SYSTEM ARE THIRSTY FOR CIVIC SUPPORT AND EDUCATION. STUDENTS PURSUING HIGHER EDUCATION DROUGHT OUR STATE AND OUR NATION ARE ACHING FOR GUIDANCE AND A MORE UNIFORM SYSTEM ARE UNAWARE OF HOW TO MAKE THIS POSSIBLE. THIS BILL IS A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. MY GENERATION HAS NOT BEEN PROPERLY PREPARED TO COMPETENTLY AND CONCISELY NAVIGATE OUR GREAT NATION CIVIC ENGAGEMENT PROCESS AND THIS IS NO FAULT OF OUR OWN. WE SPENT FOUR YEARS IN HIGH SCHOOL AND HIGH SCHOOL AND GOVERNMENT IS ONLY REQUIRED FOR ONE SEMESTER. THIS RESULTED IN A HUGE NUMBER OF COLLEGE STUDENTS LIKE MYSELF WHO ENTERS WHO ENTER ADULTHOOD AN EDUCATED ABOUT CIVIC ENGAGEMENT AND CIVIC DUTY. I'M AWARE OF THE POWER OF OUR VOICE THE VOTING AND THE IMPORTANCE INTENDED TANGIBILITY OF THEIR INVOLVEMENT WITH IN OUR SOCIO POLITICAL SYSTEMS. THE STATUS QUO ACADEMIA HAS STOPPED HAS SHALLOWLY TAUGHT THAT SUIT AS ALWAYS TAUGHT STUDENTS ABOUT HOW OUR POLITICAL SYSTEMS WORK. BUT NOT ABOUT THE CIVIC WE ENGAGE VOTERS AND GRASSROOTS ORGANIZERS WHO MAKE THE SYSTEMS WORK. THIS BILL WOULD URGE THOSE WHO ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT TO ENSURE THAT THERE IS A DESIGNATED NONPARTISAN POSITION. ON THE CAMPUS OF EVERY PUBLIC UNIVERSITY IN THIS GREAT STATE. THE HOLDERS OF THIS POSITION WOULD HAVE THE HONOR AND RESPECT AND RESPONSIBILITY TO FURTHER EMPOWER OVER THREE POINT ONE MILLION CALIFORNIANS THAT MAKE UP OUR HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEM. THEIR CIVIC ENGAGEMENT EDUCATION PROGRAMMING AND RESOURCES. BY DESIGNATING FUNDS TO A PROGRAM THAT IS CATERED TO THE CIVIC RESPONSIBILITY. WE BELIEVE. RESPONSIBILITY AND DEVELOPMENT OF OUR COUNTRY'S NEXT LEADERS IT IS ONLY A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE MY GENERATION FLOOD THE JOB MARKET POLITICAL ARENAS AND OTHER SECTORS OF OF SOCIETY. THAT REQUIRES CIVIC WE ENGAGE CITIZEN WITH A TENDENCY TO VOTE. AND KNOWING THAT IT IS VITAL THAT THE LAWMAKERS OF OUR BEAUTIFUL STATE STATE SET STANDARDS THAT ENSURE OUR GENERATION AND THOSE WHO FOLLOW. ARE ENTHUSIASTIC AND PREPARED TO COMPLETE THEIR CIVIC DUTY. AS A PROUD FRESNO STATE BULLDOGS DUE TO THIS IF CSU SYSTEM AND ON BEHALF OF THE END OF A C. P.. I ENCOURAGE YOU TO FULLY SUPPORT AB NINE SIXTY THREE THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER JACKSON. REPRESENTED THANK YOU. HI EVERYONE MY NAME IS LIZ LITTLE CHATTANOOGA I'M IT'S AN F. AS A STATE AND I AM GOING INTO MY THIRD YEAR AS A DOUBLE MAJOR IN POLITICAL SCIENCE AND TO KIND OF STUDY. I CAN ONLY SERVE AS A VICE PRESIDENT EXTERNAL AFFAIRS FOR A AS I WHERE I SERVED TWENTY TWO THOUSAND WITHIN TWENTY ONE STUDENTS. I SAY ON SAYS A SAY AS A VOTING MEMBER WERE NEARLY FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND STUDENTS ARE BEING REPRESENTED. ADDITIONALLY I SERVE AS A PRESIDENT BY THE DELTA AND IGNITE. THESE ORGANIZATIONS ALONGSIDE OTHERS ALSO SEEK TO EDUCATE THIS IN A BODY WITH NONPARTISAN MATERIALS MANY STUDENTS AND TO GET INVOLVED ON CAMPUS BUT MANY DO NOT HAVE THE RESOURCES TO ACCOMMODATE THEM TO BECOME CIVIC WE ENGAGED. THIS BILL AIMS TO PUSH FOR AN EFFORT THAT WOULD EMPOWER A NEW GENERATION OF VOTERS HOWEVER SONORA GRADATIONS NOT SUFFICE THE NEEDS TO GET THE YOUNG GENERATION TO VOTE. THIS BILL AB NINE SIX THREE IS A NONPARTISAN AND HAS A RESOURCES ARE NEEDED TO GET THE THREE POINT ONE MILLION STUDENTS WITHIN PUBLIC HIGHER EDUCATION. TO BRING THE POWER TO THE POLLS. WHEN THE TWENTY FORTY MITTENS OCCURRED ONLY A POINT 2% ELIGIBLE EIGHTEEN TWENTY FOUR YEAR OLD VOTED? UNIVERSITY STUDENT TURNOUT INCREASED BY 10% AND TWENTY FOURTEEN TO TWENTY EIGHTEEN NATIONWIDE THESE NUMBERS DO NOT REFLECT THE CONVERSATIONS THAT STUDENTS HAVE. IN ORDER TO SEE THE DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLE TO INFECTED WITHIN OUR COUNTRY THIS BILL MUST PASS WHERE THE VOICES OF THE THREE POINT ONE MILLION SINCE SOMEWHERE -- TING YOU TO LISTEN IN TWENTY SIXTEEN THE SECRETARY OF STATE THE SSA AND THIS AT CSU OFFICE OF THE CHANCELLOR SIGN M. O. U. THAT RECOGNIZES. THEIR SHARED GOAL OF INCREASING THE DEMOCRATIC ENGAGEMENT AND CIVIC LITERACY OF STUDENTS BY WORKING TOGETHER ALL PARTIES CAN AMPLIFY THE REACH AND STRENGTH OF THEIR EFFORTS. ARE WE SO INCIDENT HAVING AN EVEN GREATER FOR MOIST AND THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS WHEN YOU BILL I FOR THIS BILL YOU ARE BEING HELD ACCOUNTABLE TO THE GOALS OF EACH OF THESE ORGANIZATIONS INCLUDING THE SECRETARY OF STATE. AS ALL OF YOU ARE ELECTED PUBLIC OFFICIALS I MUST EMPHASIZE THE POINT OF HOW IMPORTANT AND CRUCIAL OUR ELECTION SYSTEM IS DISTINCT ALL OF YOU WENT TO THE HARDSHIP OF SPREADING THE WORD OF ADVOCATING YOU CONSTITUENTS TO VOTE. WITH THIS IN MIND IT IS UNFORTUNATE TO SEE THAT THE YOUNGER GENERATION HAS NOT BEEN A POLITICALLY ACTIVE. IS THE CENTRAL RIGHT OF OURS HAS BEEN TAKEN FOR GRANTED AS A RESULT I'M HERE TODAY ADVOCATING FOR THE NEEDS THAT YOU AS LIKE OFFICIALS PASS BILL NINE SIX THREE WHICH WILL INCREASE THE NUMBER OF STUDENT BECOMING AWARE. UNDERSTANDING IN BUILDING DURING OUR ELECTIONS I CITY BY JAMES FREEMAN CLARKE A POLITICIAN THINGS IN THE NEXT ELECTION. THE STATE'S PERCENT OF THE NEXT GENERATION SO PLEASE HELP IN A GENERATION BY PASSING THIS BILL AS A LIVE TRUCKER ELECTED OFFICIALS FOR ASSISTANCE AND GUIDANCE THANK YOU. THANK YOU YES FRESNO STATE IS WELL REPRESENTED. THE BURDEN IS UPON YOU THOUGH WHAT WE'RE YOU'RE GOING TO BE AROUND A LOT LONGER THAN WE ARE -- THAT FOLKS ARE RESPONSIBLE OTHERS IN SUPPORT. HI -- MY NAME IS KIM NALDER I'M A PROFESSOR OF POLITICAL SCIENCE AT CSU SACRAMENTO. AND I ALSO RUN AN ORGANIZATION CALLED THE PROJECT FOR AN INFORMED ELECTORATE ON OUR CAMPUS WHERE WE TRY TO INFORM VOTERS ABOUT POLITICS AND POLICY IN A NON PARTISAN WAY. USING THE TOOLS OF THE ACADEMY LIKE RESEARCH. AND SO I WOULD LIKELY BE ONE OF THE PEOPLE WHO WAS ON THE COMMITTEE ON MY CAMPUS OF BE CREATED BY THIS BILL. TWO PUT FORWARD EVENTS THAT WOULD BE SUPPORTED BY THIS BILL AND TO COME UP WITH AN ACTION PLAN FOR OUR CAMPUS AND AND I DO ENCOURAGE. AT A SUPPORT FOR THIS BILL -- I TEACH THE INTRO TO AMERICAN POLITICS COURSE THAT ALL OF OUR STUDENTS ARE EXPECTED TO TAKE LIKELY BECAUSE THE RED LEGISLATURE REQUIRES IT AND EVERY SEMESTER WHEN I TEACH THAT I ASK THE STUDENTS HOW MANY OF THEM GREW UP IN A HOUSEHOLD. WHERE THEIR PARENTS OR GUARDIANS TALKED ABOUT POLITICS OR POLICY OR CITIZENSHIP OR ANY OF THOSE THINGS? AND THE VAST MAJORITY OF THEM DID NOT GROW UP IN SUCH A HOUSEHOLD. AND SO THEY WERE NOT SOCIALIZED INTO CIVIC PARTICIPATION AND SO IT FALLS ON US AT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES. TO FILL THAT GAP IN AND ONE OF OUR YOU KNOW RESPONSIBILITIES AS UNIVERSITY FACULTY. IS TO ENCOURAGE POSITIVE LIFELONG HABITS AND THE HABIT OF VOTING IS IS CERTAINLY ONE OF THOSE. ANOTHER PART OF THIS BILL I THINK IS IMPORTANT IS THAT IT REQUIRES CAMPUSES TO SEND OUT REMINDERS ON EMAIL AND SOCIAL MEDIA. FOR REGISTRATION TO VOTE AND AND REGISTRY AND AND VOTING BATES AND SO FORTH AND I FIND THAT TO BE REALLY IMPORTANT TO I KNOW MY STUDENTS REALLY APPRECIATE IT WHEN I ENCOURAGE THEM. REMIND THEM OF THE DATES OF IN TERMS OF FINALS AND SO FORTH AND VOTING IS NO DIFFERENT. THE UNDERSTANDING OF WHEN THOSE ARE HAPPENING AND HOW TO REGISTER AND WHEN TO REGISTER AND SO ON IS VERY IMPORTANT. SO I ENCOURAGE VOTING FOR THIS BILL SO THAT WE CAN KEEP CALIFORNIA ONE OF THE STATE'S THAT ENCOURAGES VOTING RATHER THAN DISCOURAGES PUTTING. THANK YOU PROFESSOR WILL BE FOR BEFORE WE TAKE MORE SUPPORT WE'RE GONNA STYLISH A QUORUM. THE MADAM SECRETARY IF YOU CALL THE ROLL NUMBER. YOUR NUMBER HERE NIELSEN. NIELSEN HERE HERTZBERG LEYVA LEYVA HERE STERN. ALL RIGHT WE HAVE A QUORUM -- OTHERS IN SUPPORT. MELISSA ROMERO WITH THE CALIFORNIA LEAGUE OF CONSERVATION VOTERS IN SUPPORT.

OKAY THANK YOU [inaudible] YEAH ASSEMBLY WOMAN CERVANTES YOU HAVE [inaudible] A. B.. OF FORTY NINE N. A. B. O. TWO OH ONE WHICH ONE WOULD YOU LIKE TO FIRST. DO ON MEN -- NUMBER ORDER ALL RIGHT. BUT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO PRESENT ASSEMBLY BILL FORTY NINE TODAY THE CALIFORNIA VOTER PROTECTION ACT OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN ACTUALLY LIKE TO BEGAN BY ACCEPTING THE CHAIR SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS. I WHICH WOULD ALLOW COUNTIES TO REQUEST A WAIVER FROM THE SECRETARY STATE TO THE VOTE CENTER POSITION OF THE BILL. I IN A REPRESENTED YOU MARKET SEE LIKE OURS NOTHING IS MORE FUNDAMENTAL THAN PROTECTING AND PROMOTING THE RIGHT TO VOTE. OUR STATE. HAVE A BODY THIS BY MAKING VOTING BY MAIL EASIER AND MORE ACCESSIBLE. AS A RESULT MORE MORE CALIFORNIA VOTERS ARE CHOOSING TO EXERCISE THEIR RIGHT TO VOTE BY MAIL THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN MID TERM ELECTIONS MORE THAN 65% OF CALIFORNIANS USE VOTE BY MAIL BALLOTS. IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT OUR STATE LAWS REFLECT A GROWING REALITY. HOWEVER SALLY DURING THE SAME MID TERMS IT BECAME EVIDENT THAT THE THESE LAWS ARE ALSO FLAWED AND WE MUST FIX THEM. THERE ARE MANY INSTANCES OF VOTERS WHO DO NOT RECEIVE THEIR BALLOTS UP UNTIL THE DAY BEFORE THE ELECTION ON ELECTION DAY AND SO I'M NEVER RECEIVED THEIR BALLOT AT ALL. I REQUIRING THEM TO REQUEST A PROVISIONAL BALLOT. SOME VOTERS AS I MENTIONED I DIDN'T ARE NOT AWARE OF THE PROVISIONAL BALLOT PROCESS IT'S AN EDUCATION HI THAT WE STILL HAVE TO GET OUT TO THE COMMUNITY. ESPECIALLY FIRST TIME VOTERS THE CALIFORNIA VOTER PROTECTION ACT WILL HELP FIX THIS IN TWO WAYS FIRST IT WILL REQUIRE COUNTY REGISTRARS TO COMPLETE. THE DISTRIBUTION MAIL BALLOTS TO EARLY VOTE BY MAIL VOTERS ARE WITHIN FIVE DAYS WHEN THEY START THE MAIL. BALLOT PROCESS WHEN THEY START MAILING THEM OUT. I IN THE EXISTING LAW THIS IS TWENTY NINE DAYS BEFORE THE ELECTION DAY. LET ME BE CLEAR THIS BILL DOES NOT CHANGE THE EXISTING TIMELINE FOR WHEN BALLOT MAIL BALLOTS ARE SENT. BY INSURING THAT EARLY REGISTRANTS ARE CENTER BALLOTS WITHIN FIVE DAYS OF THE EXISTING THRESHOLD WILL MAKE IT MORE LIKELY THAT VOTERS WILL RECEIVE THEIR BALLOTS ON TIME ALLOWING THEM TO THE TO DO THE APPROPRIATE RESEARCH. ON CANDIDATES AND MEASURES. COUNTIES WILL STILL BE ABLE TO SEND VOTERS WHO CHOOSE TO REGISTER EYES VB AND AFTER THE EXISTING TWENTY NINE DAYS ON A ROLLING BASIS. SECOND THE BILL ALSO REQUIRE THAT A VOTE CENTER. I BUT I BOTH CENTER COUNTIES THAT THERE'S A VOTE CENTER IN EACH ASSEMBLY DISTRICT THAT IS. FIVE FIFTY THOUSAND POPULATION. FOR MORE. AS AMENDED THIS BILL WOULD ALLOW COUNTIES TO REQUEST A WAIVER. TO THE SECRETARY STATE THAT IT ALSO EXPLAINS WHY THEY CANNOT COMPLY WITH THIS REQUIREMENT. I JUST TO ALSO NOTES I PERSONALLY HAD A CONVERSATION WITH THAT THE SECRETARY STAY ON THIS. MATTER -- WHICH HE SUPPORTS -- THE FIRST PROVISIONS SECOND PROVISION THE VOTE CENTERS I WE DID HAVE A LENGTHY CONVERSATION IN WHICH WE AGREE TO THIS BILL GET OUT TODAY WE WILL WORK ON AMENDMENTS I IN THE NEXT COMMITTEE.

I LIKE OTHER FORMS A CAMPAIGN COMMUNICATION INCLUDING ADVERTISEMENT OVER TELEVISION OR RADIO -- OR CAMPAIGN MAILERS SOME CAMPAIGN TEXT MESSAGES ARE REGULATED AND MUST INCLUDE DISCLOSURES ON WHAT ENTITY IS PAYING FOR THE COMMUNICATION. HOWEVER DUE TO THE PASSAGE OF VERY SELECTION REFORM THAT WE TOOK UP LOST -- SESSION THESE REGULATIONS OF TEXT MESSAGES ARE SET TO EXPIRE JANUARY ONE OF TWENTY TWENTY THIS IS A PROBLEM THAT HAS BEEN RECOGNIZED BY BOTH THE ASSEMBLY ELECTIONS COMMITTEE AND THE SENATE ELECTIONS COMMITTEE PER THEIR ANALYSIS. I LET ME BE CLEAR NEXT YEAR WILL BE NO DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS-FOR CAMPAIGN TAX MESSAGES WHICH IS WHY WE BELIEVE IT IS SO VITAL TO TAKE THIS BILL UP TODAY. ASSEMBLY BILL TWO OH ONE WILL BOTH. RESTORED THOSE DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS AND EXPAND THEM. IT WILL REQUIRE COMMITTEES OF ALL TYPES BE A CANDIDATES I BE IT A POLITICAL PARTY INDEPENDENT EXPENDITURE. TO INCLUDE SOME FORM OF DISCLOSURE. TAX MESSAGES ARE YOU A UNIQUE MEDIUM WHERE THE POLITICAL REFORM ACT IS CONCERNED. OR ANY OTHER FORM OF MEDIA THE ABILITY TO EXPERIENCE BOTH THE POLITICAL ADVERTISEMENT AND DISCLOSURES BILL INTO THE MEDIUM ITSELF. I FOR INSTANCE THE POLITICAL ADVERTISEMENT ON TELEVISION OR RADIO YOU CAN HEAR IT YOU CAN SEE IT AYE AYES IT'S ADVERTISED BUT YOU'RE ALSO YOU'RE ALSO ABLE TO READ THE DISCLOSURE. ON SOCIAL MEDIA THE ABILITY TO GO ONLINE AND ACCESS SOCIAL MEDIA ALSO CARRIES ITS ABILITY TO ACCESS HYPERLINKED DISCLOSURES THAT EXIST. THAT THE EXISTING LAW REQUIRES SPECIAL SOCIAL MEDIA ADVERTISEMENTS HOWEVER TAX MESSAGES EXIST IN A VERY GRAY AREA WHERE THE LACK OF UNIFORMITY. AND THE TECHNOLOGICAL CAPACITY LEADS TO A LACK OF UNIFORMITY IN THE ABILITY FOR VOTERS TO ACCESS. FOR AXIS A PAID FOR DISCLOSURE. INTO A PEW STUDY. I RELEASED LAST MONTH 50% OF AMERICAN ADULTS CURRENTLY OWN THEIR OWN A CELL PHONE DO NOT HAVE SMARTPHONE CAPABILITIES I USING TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN POPULATION ESTIMATES THAT MEANS ABOUT. THIRTY SEVEN POINT NINE MILLION AMERICAN ADULTS AND FOUR POINT FIVE SIX MILLION CALIFORNIANS ADULTS. OWN CELL PHONES THAT ARE NOT SMART PHONES. THESE AND NON SMARTPHONES USES TRADITIONAL SMS SYSTEM FOR TEXT MESSAGES UNDER THAT SYSTEM THE STANDARD LENGTH OF A TEXT MESSAGE IS A HUNDRED AND SIXTY CHARACTERS. BECAUSE OF THIS LACK OF TECHNOLOGICAL UNIFORMITY IN CELL PHONES WE MUST BALANCE TECHNOLOGY ONE NOT INTERFERING WITH THE COMMITTEE'S ABILITY TO GET A MESSAGE ACROSS A POLITICAL MESSAGE ACROSS. I THIS BILL WE BROUGHT UP IS IS A VERY REAL CONCERN I WILL SHARE WITH YOU THAT WE EXPERIENCE IN THIS LAST ELECTION CYCLE. I'M AN UNKNOWN ENTITY SENT A TEXT MESSAGE ATTACKING ME TO WATCHING ACTS VOTERS IN THE DISTRICT THAT I REPRESENT. HOWEVER BECAUSE OF THE CURRENT STATE OF REGULATIONS ON TEXT MESSAGES. THERE WAS NO PAY FOR DISCLOSURE IT WAS REQUIRED SO NO ONE KNEW WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THOSE SAID TEXT MESSAGES. IF WE DO NOT PASS THIS BILL TODAY WE CAN EXPECT THAT THE ATTACK MESSAGES PAID FOR BY DARK MANY MUCH LIKE WHAT I EXPERIENCE WILL BECOME. THE RULE RATHER THAN THE EXCEPTION. WITH ME. ACTUALLY I JUST WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE BY RESPECTFULLY ASKING FOR YOUR I'D VOTE AND I THINK YOU FOR YOUR WILLINGNESS TO WORK WITH US AS THIS BILL. HAS BEEN. RIGHT HERE COMMITTEE THANK YOU ASSEMBLY WOMAN CERVANTES YES. OTHERS IN SUPPORT [inaudible] OPPOSITION. MORNING CHAIR AT MEMBERS FRONTLINE PRESENT A CALIFORNIA CLEAN MONEY CAMPAIGN WE WERE IN OPPOSITION A LESS AMENDED -- WE GREATLY APPRECIATE WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR. ON THESE AMENDMENTS. TO ALLOW US TO REMOVE OUR OPPOSITION WE'VE ALWAYS APPRECIATED THE NEED FOR THIS BILL SHE'S ABSOLUTELY RIGHT TO DISCLOSE THAT CLEARLY DOES NOT COVER CURRENTLY. A TEXT MESSAGES EVEN ROBO TAX -- BY CANDIDATES OR POLITICAL PARTIES AND SO IT'S ALWAYS APPRECIATED THE IMPORTANCE OF THAT PART OF OF THE BILL OUR CONCERN WAS OF COURSE WE DID NOT WANT THERE TO BE A A LOOPHOLE IN CASES WHERE PEOPLE ARE WAS PRACTICABLE TO SEND THE TOP TWO FUNDERS BECAUSE EVERY OTHER FORM. OF ADVERTISEMENT PRACTICALLY SPEAKING IN THE DISCLOSE ACT EXCEPT FOR SMALL GRAPHIC ADS. ARE A MUST SHOW THEIR OF THEIR TOP TWO FUNDERS -- WE BELIEVE THAT THIS THIS A COMPROMISE ADDRESSES THAT -- TO ENSURE THAT IN MOST CASES THE DEFAULT IS THAT YOU SHOW THE TOP TWO FUNDERS JUST LIKE THE REST THE DISCLOSE ACT BUT WOULD GIVE THAT EXCEPTION IF IT'S IMPRACTICABLE FOR THE SORT THE CASES SHE OUTLINED SO. WITH THAT WE WILL -- AS LONG AS WE CAN WORK OUT THE DETAILS AS I SOON WE WILL BE ABLE TO AYE GOING FORWARD -- WE WILL REMOVE OUR OPPOSITION THANK YOU AT THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE COMMITTEE FOR HELPING AND WORK WITH US ON THESE DETAILS AND THANK YOU FOR PRETTY MUCH TO THE AUTHOR.

I TEN KNOW [inaudible] ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU WILL KEEP THE ROLE OPEN A CERTIFICATE THE SENATORS ARE HERE -- ALLEN CENTER WIENER. FLOOR IS YOURS MISTER CHAIR AND pPLEASED TO BE HERE TODAY -- AND BOTH TOGETHER MY JOINT AUTHORED ALSO WITH THE FOR FERMENTABLE ARRAY OF CO SPONSORS TO PRESENT. SENATE CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT. ONE WHICH WOULD PLACE A MEASURE ON A FUTURE STATEWIDE BALLOT ASKING VOTERS TO REPEAL. ARTICLE THIRTY FOUR OF CALIFORNIA'S CONSTITUTION IN ITS ENTIRETY. THE PROVISION PASSED BY VOTERS IN. NINETEEN FIFTY AND IT REQUIRES MAJORITY APPROVAL BY VOTERS OF ANY CITY OR COUNTY FOR THE DEVELOPMENT CONSTRUCTION -- ACQUISITION OF A PUBLICLY FUNDED. LOW RENT. HOUSING PROJECT NOW THE MEASURE WAS A DIRECT RESPONSE TO THE FEDERAL. HOUSING ACT OF NINETEEN FORTY NINE PART OF HARRY TRUMAN'S A FAIR DEAL WHICH WAS -- THE INSIDE TO HELP. LOWER INCOME POSTS WERE FAMILIES MOVE OUT OF THE SLUMS AND INTO BETTER LIVING SITUATIONS SO. THOUSANDS IN OUR STATE DID A LONG LONG TIME AGO BUT THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT. OUR STATE HAS CHANGED CONSIDERABLY SINCE. NINETEEN FIFTY OUR SOCIETY CERTAINLY HAS VERY DIFFERENT ATTITUDES NOW ABOUT RACE IN THIS RACE AND ETHNICITY CLASS AND POVERTY. HI BUT NOTHING TO POINT OUT. WAS AT THE TIME THEY WERE FAR FUEL TOOLS. ARE FOR RESIDENTS TO ALTER OR BLOCK PLANS FOR NEW HOUSING THERE WAS NO ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT THERE WAS NO BROWN ACT THERE'S NO COASTAL ACT. THERE WERE FAR FEWER LAWSUITS IN GENERAL YOU CAN LOOK AT THE CHARTS ON ON THAT. SO I THOUGHT NOW ARTICLE THIRTY FOUR REALLY DOES STAND AS AN ANACHRONISTIC AND EXPENSIVE CONSTITUTIONAL BARRIER. THAT SUBJECTS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO A WEB OF REGULATIONS AND COSTLY ELECTIONS A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY THAT END UP DRIVING UP THE PRICE OF BUILDING PUBLICLY FINANCED AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AND I WILL SAY IN RECENT YEARS CALIFORIA'S VOTERS HAVE TIME AND TIME AGAIN MADE IT VERY CLEAR THAT THEY WANT US AS THEIR pTO DO A BETTER JOB -- BY THOSE WHO ARE HOMELESS BETTER JOB FOR THOSE WHO ARE STRUGGLING TO FIND. AFFORDABLE HOUSING. PEOPLE BEEN UP AND DOWN THE STATE THEY SUPPORTED STATE LOCAL BALLOT MEASURES TO DEDICATE. HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF TAXPAYER DOLLARS TO TACKLING OUR HOUSING AND OMELESSNESS CRISES. AND YOU KNOW WE WE REALLY DO OWE IT TO THESE TAXPAYERS TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT THAT ARE AGENCIES CAN USE THIS MONEY AS COST EFFECTIVELY AS POSSIBLE. HI N. RIGHT NOW ARTICLE THIRTY FOUR STANDING IN THE WAY OF THAT. SO VOTE FOR SCA ONE TODAY. IT IS IS. IS IS BASICALLY TO GIVE OUR VOTERS THE PEOPLE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THE OPPORTUNITY. TO CONSIDER VOTING TO ELIMINATE AN OBSTACLE. I IN THE CURRENTLY IS IN TRYING TO OUR CONSTITUTION WHICH REALLY DOES UNDERMINE THE ABILITY OF OUR ELECTED LEADERSHIP. IN LOCAL TOWNS AND COMMUNITIES AND COUNTIES UP AND ON THE STATE TO ADDRESS -- CALIFORNIA'S ACUTE HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS CHALLENGE AND I I REALLY DO HOPE THAT FOLKS WILL GIVE THIS STRONG CONSIDERATION. AND I'D LIKE TO INTRODUCE OUR JOINT AUTHOR HERE CENTER WIENER -- WIENER THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN OF THANK YOU CENTER ALLEN FOR COLLABORATING ON THIS I THINK CRITICALLY IMPORTANT. I ARTICLE THIRTY FOUR IS THIS CAR ON THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION. FRANKLY IT IS EMBARRASSING. OUT OF STATE AS PROGRESSIVE AS CALIFORNIA. HAS THIS -- THANK THE DISCRIMINATORY OUR REQUIREMENTS IT'S IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THAT WHATEVER PEOPLE THINK IT WHATEVER YOU THINK ABOUT WHETHER HOUSING PROJECTS TO GO ON THE BALLOT OR KNOCK ON THE BALLOT -- I PERSONALLY AM NOT A FAN OF PUTTING YOUR HOUSING DECISIONS ON THE BALLOT BUT EVEN IF YOU SUPPORT THAT. ON PARTICLE. THIRTY FOUR SINGLES OUT ONLY ONE KIND OF HOUSING HOUSING FOR LOW INCOME PEOPLE THAT IS PUBLICLY FINANCED. AND SAYS THE ONLY BACK KIND OF HOUSING HAS TO GO ON THE BALLOT NO OTHER KIND OF HOUSING. IT IS IRRATIONAL. I'M PARTICULARLY GIVEN THE DEATH OF OUR HOUSING CRISIS HERE IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE A THREE AND A HALF MILLION HOME DEFICIT. AND ABOUT ONE AND A HALF MILLION OF THOSE HOMES NEED TO BE HOMES AFFORDABLE TO LOW INCOME RESIDENTS. TO WE NEED TO MAKE IT EASIER TO CREATE HOUSING SO THE LOW INCOME PEOPLE. REMAIN HAL'S. AND THIS MAKES IT HARD. WE HAVE MORE MORE CALIFORNIANS WHO WERE LIVING IN THEIR CARS. NOW WE HAVE MULTIPLE BILLS MOVING THROUGH THE SENATE RIGHT NOW. TO REQUIRE THE CREATION OF OF SAFE PARKING PROGRAMS WHILE I SUPPORT THOSE BILLS -- IT IS A MORAL FAILURE. THAT WE ARE IN A POSITION THAT WE'RE FORCING PEOPLE TO LIVE IN THEIR CARS. AND OUR RESPONSE IS LET'S JUST MAKE SURE WE HAVE SAY PARKING PROGRAMS WILL THAT'S TRIAGE. THE SOLUTION IS HOUSING AND AT SENATE CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT ONE BY REPEALING. THE THIS HORRIBLE ARTICLE THIRTY FOUR WILL MAKE IT EASIER TO BUILD A HOUSING THAT WE NEED TO ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. OTHERS IN SUPPORT WE HAVE TO WIN THIS IS WHAT I WILL POINT OUT BY THE WAY THAT THE VERY ORGANIZATION THE CONFERENCE DECISION REALTORS THAT GOT ARTICLE THIRTY FOUR AND THE CONSTITUTION THE FIRST PLACE. IS NOW WHEN VERY PROUD TO SAY A SPONSOR. OF THIS. I SCA ONE WHICH SEEKS TO REPEAL. ARTICLE THIRTY FOUR WE HAVE WITH US TODAY MARK NOT WORN FOR THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY AND ALSO A LUIS ME THAT DAY FROM. CALIFORNIA. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS MINES MATTHEW WORN WITH THE LAW FOUNDATION OF SILICON. EXCUSE ME THE WEAPONS ARE ALONG POVERTY THE SPONSORS OF SCA -- ONE BY ALL ACCOUNTS CALIFORNIA'S HOUSING CRISIS CONTINUES TO DEEPEN. IT IS. BY FAR THE MOST ACUTE FOR THE LOWEST END. OF THE INCOME SPECTRUM OUR CLIENTS. ACCORDING TO THE CALIFORNIA HOUSING PARTNERSHIP THE STATE A SHORT AN ESTIMATED ONE POINT FOUR MILLION RENTAL HOMES. AFFORDABLE TO VERY LOW AND EXTREMELY LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS ALONE. OVER 50% OF THE STATE'S VERY LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS PAY MORE THAN HALF OF THEIR INCOME IN RENT. AND OVER 75% OF EXTREMELY LOW. INCOME HOUSEHOLDS PAY MORE THAN HALF OF THEIR INCOME IN RENT. GIVEN THE STATISTICS IT SHOULD BE. NO SURPRISE TO ANYONE THAT HOMELESSNESS CONTINUES TO RISE. TO MEANINGFULLY ADDRESS THE HOUSING CRISIS WE NEED TO DRAMATICALLY INCREASE THE DEVELOPMENT OF HOUSING SPECIFICALLY AFFORDABLE TO LOWER INCOME HOUSEHOLDS IN ALMOST EVERY CORNER OF THE STATE. ARTICLE THIRTY FOUR FLIES DIRECTLY IN THE FACE OF ACHIEVING THIS GOAL BY PLACING AN UNNECESSARY CHALLENGE BEFORE CITIES IN THE FORM OF A VOTER APPROVAL REQUIREMENT. TO DEVELOP AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THIS REQUIREMENT OF OR LOOK VOTER APPROVAL HELPS TO PERPETUATE RACIALLY AND ECONOMICALLY HOMOGENOUS COMMUNITIES AND FLIES IN THE FACE. OF THE STATE'S LONGSTANDING FAIR SHARE HOUSING REQUIREMENTS. AS WELL AS THE OBLIGATIONS ALL ONE OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE UNDER BOTH STATE ANDFEDERAL LAW TO AFFIRMATIVELY FURTHER FAIR HOUSING. MEANING TO TAKE ACTIVE STEPS TO END SEGREGATION. AND HOUSING INEQUALITY. ARTICLE THIRTY FOUR EFFECTIVELY ALLOWS COMMUNITIES TO OPENLY REJECT POOR PEOPLE. WHO IN CALIFORNIA ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY PEOPLE OF COLOR? A REQUIREMENT LIKE THIS HAS NO PLACE IN THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION AND IT'S LONG PAST TIME THAT IT WAS REPEALED. I URGE YOUR IPHONE. THANK YOU OTHERS. TERM MMBERS I LOSE MY DAY WITH CALIFORNIA IN THE COMPANY AND WE CAN BE WORKS WITH DOZENS OF ORGANIZATIONS ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. TO TO PROMOTE PRO HOUSING POLICY I IN THEIR COMMUNITIES WHERE THE FOLKS WHO TRY TO TURN UP TO PLANNING COMMISSIONS AND SAY YES TO PROJECTS EXACTLY LIKE THIS. I WE'RE SUPPORTING SCA ONE TODAY BECAUSE THE REQUIREMENT TO HOLD AN ELECTION IS NOT NEUTRAL TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING. IT EMPOWERS NIMBY OPPOSITION TO NEW AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND A PRESSURES THAT AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THAT IS BUILT TO BE BILL IN CALIFORNIA'S BIG CITIES ON OTHERWISE UNDESIRABLE SITES IN INDUSTRIAL OR NON RESIDENTIAL AREAS WE'RE NEIGHBORS ONE OBJECT. CALPERS FEELING THE DETERRENT IMPOSED BY ARTICLE THIRTY FOUR SEEK TO SITE HOUSING IN THE LEAST CONTENTIOUS PLACES BUT THOSE CAN BE TOXIC UNINHABITED. AND ARE LIKELY TO FURTHER CONCENTRATE AND BECAUSE THE POVERTY THAT AFFORDABLE HOUSING INTENDS TO ALLEVIATE. IN ALL THESE EXAMPLES ARTICLE THIRTY FOUR IMPOSES SIGNIFICANT COMPLIANCE COSTS TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPERS. IN UNWISE USE OF LIMITED STATE FUNDS AVAILABLE FOR HOUSING. AT A TIME OF CRISIS CALIFORNIA CANNOT AFFORD TO SPEND IT SCARES AFFORDABLE HOUSING DOLLARS OVERCOMING SELF IMPOSED BARRIERS LIKE THOSE THAT ARTICLE THIRTY FOUR BILLS. ARTICLE THIRTY FOUR SHIFTS THE POWER BOUNCE A POWER TO NEIGHBORS WHO WOULD SAY NO TO HELPING LOW INCOME PEOPLE JOIN OUR COMMUNITY. AND IT'S TIME FOR THE STATE TO SHIFT THE BALANCE OF POWER BACK TO NEIGHBORS WHO SAY YES. WE STRONGLY URGE YOUR SUPPORT FOR SCA. ONE THANK YOU OTHERS IN SUPPORT.

NIELSEN I HERTZBERG LEYVA. LEYVA AYE STERN [inaudible] ALL RIGHT. IF THAT OPEN -- ASSEMBLY MEN BERMAN. AB SEVEN THIRTY ITEM NUMBER. NINE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN SANDERS. AS MORE MORE BAD ACTORS TRY TO INFLUENCE OUR ELECTIONS WITH MISINFORMATION CAMPAIGNS THAT SO CONFUSION AND DOUBT THROUGHOUT THE ELECTORATE. I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE WITH THE PREMISE THAT VOTERS HAVE A RIGHT TO KNOW WHEN VIDEO. AUDIO AND IMAGES THAT THEY'RE BEING SHOWN HAVE BEEN MANIPULATED AND DO NOT REPRESENT REALITY TO TRY TO INFLUENCE THEIR VOTE IN AN UPCOMING ELECTION. THAT IS WHAT MY BILL AB SEVEN THIRTY IS TRYING TO ADDRESS. THIS IS ABOUT SAFEGUARDING THE INTEGRITY OF OUR ELECTIONS. THIS TASK IS ONLY BECOME MORE CHALLENGING WITH THE INVENTION OF PROLIFERATION OF NEW TECHNOLOGY SUCH AS DEEP FAKES WHICH ARE EXTREMELY CONVINCING FABRICATED PHOTOS VIDEO OR AUDIO RECORDINGS. OF SOMEONE APPEARING TO SAY OR DO SOMETHING AND THEY DID NOT SAY OR DO. THE ABILITY TO ATTRIBUTE SPEECH AND CONDUCT TO A CANDIDATE THAT IS FALSE. THAT NEVER HAPPENED. MAKES DEEP FACE A POWERFUL AND DANGEROUS NEW TOOL IN THE ARSENAL OF THOSE THAT WANT TO WAGE MISINFORMATION CAMPAIGNS. WE'VE ALSO SEEN RECENTLY THAT VERY OLD AND CREW TECHNOLOGY CAN BE USED TO DISTORT REALITY. THE MANIPULATION OF THE VIDEO OF HOUSE SPEAKER NANCY PELOSI -- SPEECH WAS ALTERED. TO MAKE IT SEEM AS THOUGH SHE WAS DRUNK. WAS VERY LOW QUALITY BUT WAS STILL VIEWED OVER THREE MILLION TIMES ON SOCIAL MEDIA. IT IS WIDELY BELIEVED THAT THIS IS THE NEW FRONTIER IN THE MISINFORMATION WAR. THE CARNEGIE ENDOWMENT FOR INTERNATIONAL PEACE NOTES THAT DEEP FAKES HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO INCITE VIOLENCE. CULTURE ELECTION OUTCOMES AND UNDERMINE DIPLOMACY. IN JANUARY US DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE DAN COATS WARNED THAT DEEP FACE WILL PROBABLY BE AMONG THE TACTICS USED. TO DISRUPT THE TWENTY TWENTY ELECTIONS. AND IT'S ALREADY HAPPENING IN OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD. ACCORDING TO THE WASHINGTON POST IN CENTRAL AFRICA LAST YEAR A VIDEO OF THE BONES LONG UNSEEN PRESIDENT ALI BONGO. WHO WAS BELIEVED IN POOR HEALTH ARE ALREADY DEAD? WITH THE CRIED AS A DEEP FAKE BY HIS POLITICAL OPPONENTS AND CITED AS THE TRIGGER A WEEK LATER FOR AN UNSUCCESSFUL COUP BY THE GOVERNOR HE'S MILITARY. IN MAY OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN A BELGIAN SOCIALIST DEMOCRAT PARTY SHARED A DEEP FAKE OF DONALD TRUMP. URGING BELGIUM TO WITHDRAW FROM THE FROM THE PARIS AGREEMENT. IN AN EFFORT TO ATTRACT SIGNATURES FOR CLIMATE CHANGE RELATED PETITION. AND JUST LAST MONTH THE US HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES PERMANENT SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE LED BY CONGRESSMAN ADAM SCHIFF. CAN BE THE HEARING ON THE NATIONAL SECURITY CHALLENGE OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE MANIPULATED MEDIA AND DEEP FAKES. NOTING THAT DEFACE RAISE PROFOUND QUESTIONS ABOUT NATIONAL SECURITY AND DEMOCRATIC GOVERNANCE WITH INDIVIDUALS AND VOTERS NO LONGER ABLE TO TRUST THEIR OWN EYES OR YEARS WHEN ASSESSING THE AUTHENTICITY OF WHAT THEY SEE ON THEIR SCREENS. A YEAR AGO SENATOR MARCO RUBIO SAID AT THE U. S. INTELLIGENCE HEARING THAT HE EXPECTED DEFACE WOULD BE USED IN THE NEXT WAVE OF ATTACKS. AGAINST AMERICAN AND WESTERN DEMOCRACIES. WITH THE TWENTY TWENTY ELECTIONS AROUND THE CORNER WE MUST DO MORE TO CURB THE PROLIFERATION OF DEEP FAKES AND OTHER MANIPULATED MEDIA. AB SEVEN THIRTY WOULD PROHIBIT A PERSON OR ENTITY WITHIN SIXTY DAYS OF AN ELECTION FROM KNOWINGLY OR RECKLESSLY RECKLESSLY DISTRIBUTING DECEPTIVE ALL YOUR VISUAL MEDIA OF A CANDIDATE WITH THE INTENT TO INJURE THE CANDIDATES REPUTATION. OR TO DECEIVE A VOTER INTO VOTING FOR OR AGAINST THE CANDIDATE. UNLESS THE MEDIA INCLUDES A DISCLOSURE STATING THAT THE MEDIA HAS BEEN MANIPULATED. THE BILL WOULD DEFINE DECEPTIVE AUDIO OR VISUAL MEDIA TO MEAN AN IMAGE OR AUDIO OR VIDEO RECORDING IT THAT HAS BEEN INTENTIONALLY MANIPULATED IN SUCH A MANNER. THAT IT WOULD FALSELY APPEAR TO A REASONABLE OBSERVER TO BE AN AUTHENTIC RECORD OF THE ACTUAL SPEECH OR CONDUCT. OF A CANDIDATE. I WANT TO CLARIFY THAT IT IS NOT MY INTENT TO CAPTURE TOUCH UPS. SUCH AS DIGITALLY WIDENING A CANDIDATES TEETH OR CHANGING THE EXPOSURE. I'M TRYING TO TARGET DIGITALLY CREATED IMAGES AND AUDIO AND VIDEO RECORDINGS THAT PORTRAY A CANDIDATE TO HAVE SAID OR ACTED IN A WAY THAT THEY DID NOT. I WANT TO THANK THE CHAIRMAN AND HIS STAFF. FOR THE MULTIPLE CONVERSATIONS WE'VE HAD ON THIS COMPLICATED BILL. IF THE BILL PASSES OUT OF THE ELECTIONS COMMITTEE TODAY. I WILL AMENDED THE BILL TO ONLY ALLOW FOR CANDIDATES NOT VOTERS TO BRING A CIVIL ACTION. I ALSO WANT TO ADD A LOSER PAYS PROVISION AND WE'LL DISCUSS THAT WITH THE NEXT COMMITTEE. AND I WILL CONTINUE TO WORK TO TIGHTEN THE LANGUAGE IN PARTICULAR AROUND THE ISSUE OF IMAGE MANIPULATION. TO MAKE SURE THAT THE BILL IS NARROWLY TAILORED TO JUST ADDRESS THE MANIPULATION OF THE ACTUAL SPEECH OR CONDUCT OF A CANDIDATE. NOT MINOR STATIC TOUCH UPS. I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE SIGNIFICANT FIRST AMENDMENT CONCERNS WITH THE BILL AS IT IS CURRENTLY DRAFTED AND I'M COMMITTED TO WORKING THROUGH THESE ISSUES. I WOULD NOTE HOWEVER THAT I HAVEN'T SEEN A COURT DETERMINE THAT THE FIRST AMENDMENT GRANTS SOMEONE THE RIGHT TO LITERALLY PUT IN THEIR WORDS. INTO MY MOUTH. WHICH IS WHAT THIS TECHNOLOGY DOES. IF PASSED OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE TODAY THE BILL WILL BE REFERRED TO SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE NEXT WHERE I'M SURE THESE ISSUES WILL GET A THOROUGH VETTING. HOWEVER AS NOTED IN THE ACLU'S OPPOSITION LETTER ELECTION INTEGRITY IS A WEIGHTY GOVERNMENTAL INTEREST THAT MAY BE ACCOMPLISHED. UNDER THE FIRST AMENDMENT IF NARROWLY TAILORED. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU OTHERS IN SUPPORT OF OPPOSITION BEFORE YOU TESTIFY I'M GONNA HAVE TO LEAVE FOR A MOMENT S SENATOR NIELSEN TO TAKE OVER THE RESPONSIBILITY OF CHAIR -- AS THE VICE CHAIR. OF A COUPLE THINGS ONE I WANT TO MAKE MENTION -- ASSEMBLYMAN BERMAN BERMAN THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR WORKING WITH ME IN THE COMMITTEE. WE DO HAVE SOME SOME WAY TO GO -- BUT I APPRECIATE YOUR INTEREST IN I APPRECIATE YOUR DILIGENCE SO -- WE'LL SEE THIS AGAIN JUDICIARY. AND THE I'LL BE BACK HERE IN. TWO MINUTES OR SO THANKS THANKS. I THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER. VICE CHAIRMAN I'M WOULD BE PROUD THE CALIFORNIA NEWS PUBLISHERS ASSOCIATION. AND I REALLY WHAT WE SEE IS THAT WHAT THIS BILL IS CERTAINLY WELL INTENTIONED WE RECOGNIZE THAT IT'S ULTIMATELY AN INEFFECTIVE AND FRANKLY UNCONSTITUTIONAL. SOLUTION THAT CAUSES MORE PROBLEMS THAN IT SOLVES. THIS BILL IS A CONTENT BASED REGULATION OF SPEECH AND AS SUCH IT MUST BE NARROWLY TAILORED TO SERVE A COMPELLING GOVERNMENTAL PURPOSE. AS THE AUTHOR NOTED I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE THAT MAINTAINING THE INTEGRITY OF ELECTIONS IS A COMPELLING PURPOSE BUT THE PROBLEM WITH THIS BILL IS THAT IS NOT NARROWLY TAILORED. AND IT FEELS THAT TESTED A NUMBER OF WAYS THAT ARE DISCUSSED IN THE LETTER WE SUBMITTED TO THE COMMITTEE AND ARE ALSO NOTED IN THE ANALYSIS. ALL FOCUS HERE JUST ON WHAT I SEE IS THE MOST NOTABLE LACK OF NARROW TAILORING IN THIS BILL. AND KNOCKS ITS LACK OF EFFECTIVENESS TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM IT'S ATTEMPTING TO SOLVE. THE BILL RELIES ON A PERSON THAT SHARING AN AUDIO OR VISUAL WORK TO DETERMINE IF THE WORK HAS BEEN MANIPULATED YET BY ITS OWN TERMS THE BILL ONLY APPLIES WERE REASONABLE PERSON WOULD BELIEVE. THE WORK TO BE AUTHENTIC. HAVING NO RELIABLE WAY TO DETERMINE AUTHENTICITY THEIR TWO LIKELY OUTCOMES FROM THIS BILL. ONE IS I DON'T HAVE A PROFOUND CHILLING EFFECT ON SPEECH INDIVIDUALS WILL BE. I DIS INCENTIVIZE TO SHARE CONTENT THE PICTURES CANDIDATES REAL OR FAKE BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW THE DIFFERENCE. INCLUDING INDIVIDUALS ACTING IN GOOD FAITH THESE ARE NOT JUST BAD ACTORS. THE SECOND IS THAT WE'LL SEE AN OVER LABELING OF CONTENT DEPICTING CANDIDATE SO THAT PEOPLE CAN AVOID LIABILITY UNDER THE BILL. THE RESULT IS THAT VOTERS WILL BE LAST RATHER THAN MORE INFORMED. AND EVEN IN CASES WHERE LABELING. AS MANIPULATED IS APPROPRIATE UNDER THE BILL. THAT DOESN'T GIVE THE VOTER CLEAR INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT THAT MEANS WHEN IT COULD BE SOMETHING AS MINOR AS A TOUCH UP THOUGH I UNDERSTAND THE AUTHOR INTENDS TO CHANGE THAT. BUT THIS COVERS A BROAD RANGE OF WHAT IS CONSIDERED MANIPULATION AND IT DOESN'T INFORM THE VOTER AS TO WHAT THE MANIPULATION IS. THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT DEEP FIX OUR AN OLD PROBLEM OF DISINFORMATION DRESSED UP IN NEW CLOTHES AND WE ALREADY HAVE TOOLS TO ADDRESS THAT PROBLEM. SOLUTION IN TIME WE HAVE MORE SPEECH AS THE AUTHOR NOTED. THERE WAS THE NANCY PELOSI VIDEO THAT WENT AROUND AND WHAT WE SAW IS THAT THAT WAS SHARED THERE WAS A CONVERSATION AND IT WAS CALLED OUT AS FATE [inaudible] IF. IT'S NOT CLEAR THAT SOME BEANS FAKE. THIS BILL WOULD PROHIBIT EVEN HAVING THAT CONVERSATION UNLESS THE DETERMINATION HAS ALREADY BEEN MADE. AND SECOND WE HAVE EXISTING DEFAMATION LAWS THAT PROTECT OR THE PROVIDE A CAUSE OF ACTION. FOR A PERSON WHO HAS BEEN WHO'S HAD THE REPUTATION INJURED AS A RESULT OF A FALSE STATEMENT AROUND THEM. THERE'S A WELL DEVELOPED BODY OF LAW THAT BRINGS THOSE A DEFAMATION CAUSE OF ACTION. IN LINE WITH THE CONSTITUTION AND I DON'T SEE HOW THAT THOSE LAWS FALL DOWN IN THIS CIRCUMSTANCE SO WITH THAT WE ARE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE WE WOULD ASK FOR YOUR NO VOTE THANK YOU. GIVE PLEASE. THANK YOU MISTER VICE CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF MY NAME'S MARK POWERS AGAIN WITH THE CALIFORNIA BROADCASTERS ASSOCIATION THE RADIO AND TELEVISION STATIONS IN YOUR DISTRICT. THERE ARE YOU KNOW THE RELATIONSHIP WITH OUR AUDIENCE IS BUILT ON TRUST. BUILT ON TRANSPARENCY TO APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S INTENT IN OMBATING THESE DEEP FAKE VIDEOS UP WE HAVE TO OPPOSE THIS INITIAL EFFORT. AS YOU KNOW THE WORLD OF POLITICAL SPEECH IS COMPLEX IS FRAUGHT WITH PITFALLS AND FOR THOSE TO TRY TO IMPOSE RESTRICTIONS. BASS A REALLY HIGH HURDLE LOCKED. THIS IS NOT JUST TECHNICALLY IMPRACTICAL BUT IS LEGALLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR YOUR DISTRICT BOB BROADCASTERS TO COMPLY WITH. YOUR SENATE OPPONENT THE NEXT ELECTION COULD PLACE A DEEP FAKE AD ON THE RADIO AND TELEVISION STATION IN YOUR DISTRICT. HE COULD TELL THE STATION THAT IS A DEEP BIG VIDEO AND YOUR LOCAL BROADCAST STATION COULD STILL DO NOTHING ABOUT IT. EVEN IF THIS BILL WERE TO PASS. FEDERAL LAW PROHIBITS RADIO AND TELEVISION STATIONS FROM CENSORING A FEDERAL STATE OR LOCAL CANDIDATES POLITICAL ADS IN ANY FASHION INCLUDING DISCLOSURES. THE ONLY EXCEPTIONS ARE FOR OBSCENE ADDS AN TO INSERT A SPONSORSHIP ID. SO BY PLANT PASSING THIS BILL YOU PUT YOUR BROADCASTERS IN EXTREME JEOPARDY. THEY CANNOT REFUSE A DEEP FAKE AD NOR CAN THEY PUT ON THE REQUIRED DISCLOSURE. THIS BILL ALSO MAKE IT MUCH MORE EFFECTIVE IN DISRUPTING YOUR LEGITIMATE CAMPAIGN ADVERTISING BEEN. BY OTHERS IT'LL HAND POLITICAL CAMPAIGNS AND ADDITIONAL TACTIC TO TRY AND FORCE YOUR ADS OFF THE AIR BY THREATENING LITIGATION. IMAGINE YOU HAVE A PICTURE OF VIDEO AND AUDIO OF YOURSELF OR YOUR OPPONENT THAT YOU'RE GOING TO USE IN AND OUT. YOUR OPPONENTS CAN THEN CLAIM THE IMAGES OR AUDIO HAS BEEN MANIPULATED. HOW ARE YOU GOING TO PROVE TO A MEDIA OUT WHITE OUTLET THAT YOU DID NOT ALTER? THOSE IMAGES FOR THAT AUDIO. BY VOTING FOR THIS BILL YOU'RE PUTTING YOUR STATIONS IN A TERRIBLE POSITION. BROADCASTERS CANNOT PROTECT THEMSELVES BY REFUSING TO AIR ADS FOR FEDERAL CANDIDATES. CAN DECLINE TO RUN ALL ADS FOR ANY GIVEN STATE OR LOCAL RACE. ONCE THEY ACCEPT AN AD FROM ONE CANDIDATE IN A STATE OR LOCAL REYES. THEY HAVE TO ACCEPT ADVERTISING FROM EVERYONE ELSE WITH NO CENSORSHIP. SO IF THERE IS NO 1100% ACCURATE WAY TO DETECT DEEP. SIX AND BROADCASTERS ARE. UNABLE LEGALLY TO REFUSE THE ONES THAT THEY SUSPECT MIGHT BE. YOUR STATIONS MAY BE FORCED TO SUSPEND TAKING ANY STATE OR LOCAL CANDIDATE ADS.

YOUR MEMBERS KEVIN BAKER FOR THE AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION OF CALIFORNIA WE APPRECIATE THE AUTHORS WERE THE OBJECTIVE. THIS IS A VERY DELICATE AREA. SPEECH IS AT THE CORE OF THE FIRST AMENDMENT UNFORTUNATELY WE'RE NOT CONVINCED THAT THE BILL IS DRAFT. THERE YET HAPPY TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR TO SEE IF WE CAN GET THERE NOT SURE IF WE CAN BUT WE WILL TRY [inaudible] MISTRUST GO. MISTER VICE CHAIR MEMBERS BERNIE OROZCO THE CALIFORNIA CABLE AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS ASOCIATION WE DID NOT POSITIONAL AGO I APOLOGIZE -- BUT I JUST WANT TO RAISE SOME CONCERNS ARE VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT MISTER POWERS HAS SAID LEE TAKENACTION TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T BLOCKS RATTLE OR DO ANYTHING TO ANYONE'S CON. AND THAT'S THE KEY THING HERE FOR US -- WE ARE NOT THE POLICE WE ARE NOT THE CENTER POLICE ON THE INTERNET ON VIDEO. OR ON ANY OTHER MEDIA MECHANISM SO RIGHT NOW THE BILL WOULD PUT AN OBLIGATION ON US. TO MAKE SURE THAT ANY CONTENT THAT'S POSTED IS NOT HAS NOT BEEN MANIPULATED. THAT'S NOT OUR ROLE BUT I DO APOLOGIZE AND WE'RE NOT OPPOSED TODAY BUT IT ALSO IS REALLY SOUNDS LIKE IT. I WILL BE BETTER POSITION FOR JUDICIARY COMMITTEE IT SHOULD THE BILL MOVE BUT WE ARE GREATLY CONCERNED ABOUT. SO MANY CHARGES PASSED LAST YEAR pANYTHING SO. THIS IS KIND OF CONTRARY TO THAT POSITION. THANK YOU HERE'S WE HAVE ONE MORE WITNESS. ERIN RIGHT BURKE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA JUDGES ASSOCIATION ALSO APOLOGIZE FOR OUR LATE -- CONCERNS HAVE NOT WE DON'T HAVE AN OF SPECIAL POSITION IN OUR CONCERN IS VERY NARROW TO THE CIVIL ACTION PRIORITIES. VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR NEARING IT TO JUST THE CANDIDATES BUT IN REGARDS TO THE PRIORITY OVER OTHER CIVIL MATTERS THERE'S MANY STATUTES THAT STATE THAT THERE MAY NOT MATTER TAKES PRIORITY. TO TO A JUDGE WE DON'T KNOW WHICH ONE ACTUALLY TAKES PRIORITY SO EVEN -- REMOVING THAT PRIORITY LANGUAGE BECAUSE THEY CAN ALWAYS COME UNDER AN EX PARTE MOTION CHIARO -- OR ALLOWING THE JUDGE DISCRETION AND WHEN THEY HAVE TO PRIORITIZE THESE CASES AT ALL HAVE PRIORITY SO THANK YOU AND WE LOOK FOR TO WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY. UP TO THE COMMITTEE DO WE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS CENTER LEYVA. MISTER VICE CHAIR. ALLOWED TO THE AUTHOR I AM I WAS WONDERING IF YOU COULD ADDRESS SOME OF THE CONCERNS OF THE OPPOSITION. I THINK THIS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT BILL AND I THINK IT'S AN ISSUE THAT'S ONLY GOING TO GET WORSE BUT I REALLY DO EMPATHIZE WITH SOME OF THE CONCERNS OF THE OPPOSITION. IS THERE A WAY TO GET TO A NEUTRAL OR A NON OPPOSE POSITION OR DO YOU THINK YOU GUYS CAN'T GET THEIR I'M YOU KNOW I'M SORRY. ASSEMBLYMEMBER I ASKED YOU THE JOB. SOMETIMES MY HEAD GOES TOO FAST. THIS COULD BE ASSEMBLY MEMBER FIRST THEN WE'LL GO TO YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU SENATOR AND LIMITED SAY AYE AYE. TOTALLY AGREE THAT THIS IS A COMPLICATED ISSUE AND AND CURRENTLY NOT A PERFECT BILL -- ANDAND SO WE'VE HAD A LOT OF GREAT CONVERSATIONS WITH -- THE DIFFERENT GROUPS THAT ARE OPPOSE I I THINK THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT ARE EASIER TO WORK OUT THAN OTHERS -- IT WAS DEFINITELY NOT OUR INTENT FOR BROADCASTERS TO PLEASE CONTENT -- AND WE CAN AND WILL AMEND THE BILL TO CLARIFY THAT THE OBLIGATION TO ADDED DISCLOSURES ON THE PERSON COMMITTEE OR AND TO THE PAYING FOR THE AD. TO BE BROADCAST -- SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THAT I'M HAPPY TO COMMIT -- TO IN WERE ALSO -- WORKING WITH THE JUDGES ASSOCIATION TO MAKE SURE. THAT WE CLARIFY THE LANGUAGE -- I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT'S THAT'S EASY TO WORK OUT -- ISSUES AROUND IT CONCERNS ARE ON THE FIRST AMENDMENT MIGHT BE -- YEAH THERE THERE MIGHT JUST BE. DISAGREEMENTS AND AND DIFFERENCES OF OPINION -- ON THAT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'RE GONNA DIVE INTO A LOT IF THE BILL GETS OUT OF ELECTIONS AND AND GOES INTO JUST THE G. JUDICIARY COMMITTEE AND I'M. RT REACHING OUT TO SOME COM LAW EXPERTS BECAUSE I HAVEN'T DUSTED OFF MY CON LAW BOOK IN IN ABOUT A DECADE AND THE NEED TO NEED TO REVISIT. WHAT THE COURTS OF SAID ON FIRST AMENDMENT -- AND PROHIBITIONS OF SPEECH THAT ARE ACTUALLY YOUR SPEECH. BECAUSE MY BILL DOES NOT PROHIBIT ANYBODY FROM STATE SAYING ANYTHING THEY WANT. TO ABOUT POLITICAL DISCOURSE OR POLITICAL ISSUES MY BILL THE SAYS THAT SOMEBODY DOESN'T HAVE THE RIGHT TO PUT THEIR WORDS IN MY MOUTH -- NOW I FULLY UNDERSTAND IT'S MORE COMPLICATED THAN THAT -- BUT WE'RE GOING TO KEEP ON WORKING WITH ALL THE PARTIES INVOLVED TO TRY TO NEARLY TAYLOR IT -- AND AND MAKE IT IS PALATABLE FOR EVERYBODY AS POSSIBLE WHILE STILL ADDRESSING THIS REALLY IMPORTANT AND AND DIFFICULT AND DANGEROUS. TECHNOLOGY BEFORE THE ELECTION NOT AFTER THE ELECTION BECAUSE SHAME ON US. IF WE WAIT UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY ONE TO DEAL WITH THIS AND HAVE THE SAME CONVERSATIONS THAT WERE ALL HAVING IN. TWENTY SEVENTEEN VERY GOOD THANK YOU. DO YOU THINK WE CAN GET THERE IS THERE A COMPROMISE SOMEWHERE IN THIS BECAUSE I DO I DO WORRY LIKE I SAID BEFORE THAT THESE DEFECTS ARE ONLY GOING TO GET WORSE AND PUT ALL OF US IN A BAD SPOT. NOT JUST AS ELECTED BUT AS THE PUBLIC AT LARGE SURE NOT I MEAN I I'D START BY SAYING WE CERTAINLY RECOGNIZE THE THE TROUBLING USES THAT THIS TECHNOLOGY CAN BE PUT TO SO. I DON'T THINK WE WANT TO SAY THAT WE DON'T RECOGNIZE THE CONCERN -- IT'S REALLY ABOUT HOW WE GET THERE AND I THINK MY COLLEAGUE WITH THE ACLU SENATE BASS WHICH IS WERE ALWAYS HAPPY TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS. I HAVE MY DOUBTS AS TO WHETHER WE CAN GET THERE IN THIS CASE BUT WE'RE CERTAINLY HAPPY TO TALK OKAY FAIR ENOUGH YEAH I THINK THE FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM THAT YOU HAVE HERE. IS THE PROCESS ITSELF. IF YOU CANNOT TELL. SOMETHING IS A DEEP ACHE YEAH IF THE EXPERTS HAVE DIFFICULTY. HOW CAN YOU PUNISH SOMEBODY NGUYEN IN THE PROCESS OF YOU'VE GOT SIXTY DAYS BEFORE ELECTION -- AND NOW LET'S SAY THAT THE BURDEN DOES FALL ON THE PERSON WHO CREATED VIDEO TO PUT THE THING WILL. THEY'RE NOT GONNA PUT IT ON YOU KNOW AND SO SOMEBODY COMES TO A RADIO TELEVISION STATE SOMEBODY COMES TO A CABLE SOMEBODY COMES TO A NEWSPAPER. AND SAYS A THIS IS THIS IS A DEEP FAKE. WHAT HAPPENS NOW? WHO IS THE ARBITER OF OF THAT FACT AND I'M JUST AFRAID THAT NO ONE WILL BE ABLE IN THAT ENTIRE PROCESS? TO STEP IN AND SAY THIS IS A DEEP FAKE THIS IS NOT A DEFECT RIGHT AND SO HOW CAN WE POLICE IT GIVEN THAT. VERY FAIR ASSEMBLY MEMBER YOU LOOK LIKE YOU WANT TO RESPOND YEAH YEAH I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND -- THE CONCERNS THAT ARE BEING REYES AND THEY JUST WANT TO NOTE THAT DARPA THE DEFENSE ADVANCED RESEARCH PROJECTS AGENCY OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT LAUNCHED A MEDIA FORENSICS PROGRAM A COUPLE YEARS AGO IN -- TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN THAT SPONSOR RESEARCH TO TO TRY TO FIGURE THIS OUT HOW DO I DO WE IDENTIFY. DEEP FAKES -- AND UC BERKELEY PROFESSOR AN IMAGE FORENSICS EXPERT HONEY FOR READ AND I APOLOGIZE ABOUT BUT SHOULD THE PRONUNCIATION -- AND HIS COLLEAGUES ARE CURRENTLY DEEP FACE OF PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES -- PRIOR TO THE TWENTY TWENTY ELECTION IN ADDITION A WELL KNOWN POLITICAL FIGURES SUCH AS DONALD TRUMP THERESA MAY JUSTIN TRUDEAU AND OTHERS SO I I THINK YOU KNOW THE FOLKS ARE WORKING ON THE TECHNOLOGY TO MAKE SURE THAT WE IDENTIFIED I THINK IT'S ONCE. WE KNOW THAT SOMETHING IS A DEEP FAKING THAT WE CALL IT A DEEP FAKE WHICH I WOULD ARGUE IS USING MORE SPEECH. THE COMBAT FALL SPEECH -- YOU KNOW WE ACTUALLY IDENTIFY FOR THE PUBLIC HEY THIS IS FAKE -- IS IS WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO GET AT AND I THINK IT JUST DEPENDS ON WHO THAT BURDEN FALLS ON IN THE PROCESS TO TURN I HEAR EXACTLY TRISTAN I GOTCHA THANK YOU. I'M GONNA SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY BECAUSE I DO THINK THIS IS A VERY SERIOUS ISSUE I HOPE THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO WORK TOGETHER -- SO THANK THANKS TO EVERYONE -- AND I'M OF THE BILL INAPPROPRIATE. ALL RIGHT WOULD YOU LIKE TO HAVE A CLOSER SEMBLANCE. THANK YOU FOR THE CONVERSATION. I KNOW THAT THIS IS COMPLICATED I REALLY APPRECIATE THE FOLKS OUT OF ENGAGED -- WE KNOW THAT -- YOU GUYS AS WE KNOW IS LEGISLATORS WE ONLY KNOW SO MUCH UNTIL WE PUT SOMETHING IN PRINT AND WE GET FEEDBACK FROM OTHERS -- AND SO I REALLY APPRECIATE THE FEEDBACK THAT WE'VE GOTTEN AND DEFINITELY WANT TO TRY TO WORK OUT -- AS MANY ISSUES AS POSSIBLE. RESPECTED AS FOR AYE VOTE. MY UNDERSTANDING IS THIS WILL GO BACK TO RULES AND THEN LIKE COULD BE REFERRED TO JEWS JUDICIAL THERE WILL BE ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY -- AND IF YOU HAVE GOTTEN YOUR MOTION DO PASS I WOULD HAVE GIVEN YOU A COURTESY ONE EVEN THOUGH I'M NOT READY TO SUPPORT IT TODAY BUT YOU HAVE YOUR MOTION SO LET US GO AHEAD TO THE ROLL CALL. AND THIS WOULD BE TO RECOUP REFER TO RULES AND THEN TO THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE [inaudible] NUMBER [inaudible] NIELSEN. NO NIELSEN NOW HERTZBERG LEYVA LEYVA AYE. THEM KEEP THE ROLE OPEN ON HOLD AND GOOD LUCK TO YOU SIR THE USER [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] THE MULLIN. THE DAY SIR YOU BRING IS AB. FIVE SEVEN ONE THANK YOUSIR MISTER VICE CHAIR MEMBERS PRESENTING AB. FIVE SEVEN ONE CALIFORNIA. IS ONE OF THE VERY FEW STATES TO HAVE STATE CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTION LIMITS. BUT NOPE OPAL CONTRIBUTION LIMITS WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT UNLESS A LOCAL GOVERNMENT ADOPTED SOME CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTION LIMITS. LITERALLY ANY AMOUNT CAN BE CONTRIBUTED DIRECTLY TO A CANDIDATE FOR LOCAL OFFICE. WE'VE SEEN EXAMPLES OF CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS RECEIVING DIRECT CONTRIBUTIONS FROM A SINGLE DONOR. THAT ARE HIGHER THAN THE AVERAGE CALIFORNIANS ANNUAL SALARY EVEN SINGLE CAN CONTRIBUTIONS AS HIGH AS ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS CONTRIBUTIONS OF THIS MAGNITUDE. UNDERMINE PUBLIC TRUST IN DEMOCRACY THIS BILL CREATES A REASONABLE DEFAULT CONTRIBUTION LIMIT TO STOP EXCESSIVE CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS FOR CITY AND COUNTY RACES WHILE ALSO RESPECTING LOCAL CONTROL. AB FIVE SEVEN ONE ESTABLISHES DEFAULT CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTION LIMITS OF FORTY SEVEN HUNDRED DOLLARS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL FOR CITIES AND COUNTIES THAT HAVE NOT ADOPTED THEIR OWN CONTRIBUTION LIMITS. THIS IS THE EXACT SAME AMOUNT AS THE STATE INDIVIDUAL CONTRIBUTION LIMITS WE ARE BOUND BY IN THE STATE ASSEMBLY AND SENATE. IT IS IMPORTANT STRESS THAT AB FIVE SEVEN ONE MAINTAINS COMPLETE LOCAL CONTROL AT ANY POINT EVEN TWENTY YEARS FROM NOW. A LOCAL JURISDICTION CAN OPT OUT BY ENACTING ITS OWN CONTRIBUTION LIMITS WHETHER LOWER OR HIGHER THAN THE DEFAULT. WITH ME TODAY IS NICOLAS HIRED ON WITH CALIFORNIA COMMON CAUSE INDOOR ROSE WITH THE LEAGUE OF WOMEN VOTERS TO OFFER ADDITIONAL COMMENTS AND SUPPORT PLEASE PROCEED. THANK YOU VICE CHAIR NICHOLAS HAD ON REPRESENTING CALIFORNIA COMMON CAUSE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF AB. FIVE SEVEN ONE WE BELIEVE WILL HELP SECURE THE INTEGRITY OF CALIFORNIA CITY AND COUNTY ELECTIONS. UNDER CURRENT LAW THE DEFAULT IS THAT THERE ARE NO CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTION LIMITS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS MAY NOT CONTRIBUTIONS. LIMITS IF THEY WISH THIS BILL MERELY SHIFTS THAT PRESUMPTIONS OF THE DEFAULT IS THAT THERE ARE LOCAL CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTION LIMITS LIMITED TO FORTY SEVEN HUNDRED DOLLARS THE SAME AS THE STATE. IT WOULD INCREASE INFLATION ALONG WITH STATE LIMITS BUT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS CRUCIALLY STILL RETAIN THE POWER TO ENACT THEIR OWN LIMITS WITH THE BE LOWER OR EVEN HIGHER. THAN THAT DEFAULT. ONLY THE VAST MAJORITY OF LOCAL JURISDICTIONS CALIFORNIA HAVE NO CONTRIBUTION LIMITS -- IN TWENTY SIXTEEN CALIFORNIA COMMON CAUSE DID A STUDY FINDING ABOUT A QUARTER CITIES AND COUNTIES. HAVE ADOPTED CONTRIBUTION LIMITS IS DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE VOTERS HAVE AT LEAST TWICE VOTED TO ESTABLISH STATE AND LOCAL LIMITS. IT'S SIMPLY QUIRK OF HISTORY THAT THOSE LIMITS WHICH WERE -- LITIGATED ON THE STATE BASIS MORE HOLD THE COURTS AND THE FINAL INITIATIVES CREATE OUR STATE LIMITS ONLY DID STAY LIMITED THROUGH THE QUIRK OF HISTORY THAT WE'VE ENDED UP WITH NO CONTRIBUTION LIMITS. UNLIMITED DONATIONS -- COMMON CAUSE FIRMLY BELIEVES AS A PROBLEM FOR DEMOCRACY THEY OPEN THE DOOR TO CORRUPTION AND PLAY. CREATE THE PARENTS OF SPECIAL INTERESTS CONTROL WHICH MORE LIES OUR DEMOCRACY AND HELPING COMMENTS AND TRANSOM SELVES AGAINST COMPETITION. I AB FIVE SOMEONE DRESSES THIS PROBLEM INHERENT WAS SYSTEM UNLIMITED CONTRIBUTION LIMITS BY CREATING JUST A REASONABLE FORTY SEVEN HUNDRED DOLLAR DEFAULT CAP. IN CLOSING JUST ONE MENTION CALIFORNIA'S ONE OF ONLY FOUR STATES HAVE STATE CONTRIBUTION LIMITS BUT NO LOCAL LIMITS WE SHOULD NOT BE NO WIRE WHEN IT COMES SAFEGUARDING INTEGRITY FOR LOCAL ELECTIONS FOR THIS REASON WE STRONGLY URGE WHEN I THOUGHT. THANK YOU. COMMENTING CENTER NIELSEN THOROS LEGAL RIVERS A CALIFORNIA THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY. THE LEAGUE WORKS EVERY DAY TO BUILD VOTER ENGAGEMENT AND THE PUBLIC'S CONFIDENCE IN THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS TO COMBAT. THE CYNICISM THAT'S CAUSED BY THE PERCEPTION AND SOMETIMES THE REALITY OF POLITICIANS. OF WHO MIGHT PUT THE INTERESTS OF THE DONOR CLASS AHEAD OF THE PUBLIC INTEREST. MONEY PRESENTS ONE OF THE GREATEST THREATS TO REPRESENTATIVE DEMOCRACY TODAY FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE IT DISTORTS INCENTIVES. RIGHT. IT'S THE MAKES THE COMPETITION IN EQUITABLE. AND IT DROWNS OUT THE VOICES OF ORDINARY VOTERS THE VAST MAJORITY OF CALIFORNIA CITIES AND COUNTIES AS YOU'VE HEARD HAVE NO -- CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTION LIMITS AT ALL AS A RESULT LOCAL CONTRIBUTIONS ARE LARGER SO THE ONES THAT STAYED ELECTIVES ARE PERMITTED TO HAVE. AT TIMES LOCAL CANDIDATES RELY ON JUST A FEW LARGE DONORS TO FUND THEIR CAMPAIGN ONE OR TWO WHEN THEIR ENTIRE CAMPAIGN. IT MAKES SENSE TO ESTABLISH THIS REALISTIC DEFAULT LIMIT ON LOCAL CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS SAID AT THE SAME LEVEL. AS LEGISLATIVE CAMPAIGNS HAVE JURISDICTIONS THAT HAVE ADOPTED THEIR OWN AT LOCAL CONTRIBUTION LIVE LIMITS AS YOU'VE HEARD WOULDN'T BE IMPACTED BY THE BILL LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WOULD REMAIN FREE TO SET A HIGHER OR LOWER LIMIT AS THEY DESIRE -- SO WHAT WE BELIEVE THAT AB. FIVE SEVENTY ONE CURVES THE INFLUENCE OF MONEY IN POLITICS AND IT'S STRENGTHENS REPRESENTATIVE DEMOCRACY WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY. PRESERVING LOCAL GOVERNMENTS FLEXIBILITY TO SET LIMITS TO SUIT THEIR OWN COMMUNITIES IN THEIR COMMUNITIES NEEDS SO WE URGE ITS PASSAGE THANK YOU. RIGHT. ANOTHER WITNESS HERE.

SENATOR THEY COULD SIMPLY ADOPT AN ORDINANCE TO THAT EFFECT AND SET A HIGHER LIMIT OR A LOWER LIMIT IT'S UP. A COMPLETELY UP TO THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENT THIS IS SIMPLY A DEFAULT WHERE THERE'S WITH THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT HAS NOT PUT IN OR IN SOME PLACE. THAT A FORTY SEVEN HUNDRED DOLLAR LIMIT WOULD WOULD BE APPLICABLE. OKAY. I WANTED TO HAVE THAT CLARIFIED. ALL RIGHT THAT SAID THEN WE HAVE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS COMMITTEE WE HAVE NONE WE HAVE A MOTION.

THE USER CAMPAIGN FUNDS FOR CHILDCARE EXPENSES INCURRED AS A RESULT OF CAMPAIGNING THIS BILL WILL HELP PARENTS WITH YOUNG CHILDREN SERVE IN PUBLIC OFFICE. IT WILL ALSO HELP TO ADVANCE MUCH NEEDED GENDER PARITY AMONG OUR ELECTED OFFICIALS CURRENTLY WOMEN COMPRISED TWENTY OR 30% OF THE LEGISLATURE BATS EXACT THAT'S ACTUALLY GROWTH. OVER LAST SESSIONS TOTAL OF 22% BUT IT'S CLEAR THAT THESE NUMBERS STILL FALL FAR SHORT. OF GENDER PARITY YOUNG PARENTS BRING IMPORTANT VOICES THE POLICY DEBATES USER VOICES WE NEED TO HEAR MORE OF NOT LESS. ANYONE WHO CURRENTLY TRIES TO USE CAMPAIGN FUNDS FOR CHILDCARE FACES RISK. AND UNCERTAINTY THEY WOULD BE RELYING ON A TWENTY FIVE YEAR OLD INFORMAL ADVICE LETTER BY THE F. B. B. C. THIS BILL OFFER EVERYONE WHO WANTS TO SEE CONSERVE A PUBLIC OFFICE THE OPPORTUNITY TO CAMPAIGN. WITHOUT HAVING TO WORRY ABOUT WHETHER THEY WILL RUN AFOUL OF OUR STATE COMPLICATED AND IN THIS REGARD. UNCERTAIN CAMPAIGN FINANCE LAWS. RECENT AMENDMENT SPECIFY THESE FUNDS CAN ONLY BE USED FOR CAMPAIGN RELATED EXPENSES THAT WOULD NOT NORMALLY BE INCURRED. WITH THESE AMENDMENTS THE F. B. B. C. HAS MOVED FROM A SUPPORT IF AMENDED POSITION TO A FULL SUPPORT POSITION. THIS BIPARTISAN BILL HAS RECEIVED NO NO VOTES IT HAS -- IT'S ALSO SUPPORTED BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE IN THIS COMMITTEE AND HERE WITH ME TO TESTIFY ON A. B.

I'M AN ADVOCATE FOR ELECTING MORE WOMEN INTO OFFICE AND WOMEN OF COLOR PEOPLE OF COLOR GENERALLY -- I AM HERE TODAY AND NOT -- ON BEHALF OF A PARTICULAR CLIENT BUT RATHER TO SPEAK TO YOU ABOUT MY EXPERIENCE -- WITH THE INTERSECTION BETWEEN CAMPAIGN FINANCE AND BEING A GENDER EQUALITY ADVOCATE. AND I'M THERE ARE TWO THINGS THAT THAT I'VE SEEN -- ONE OVER THE LAST TWENTY OR SO YEARS I'VE EITHER TRAINED OR COUNSELED YEAR WELL OVER A HUNDRED WOMEN CANDIDATES -- ONE OF THE MAIN ISSUES OUT WOMEN DECLINED TO RUN OR WAIT UNTIL LATER IN THEIR LIFE TO RUN S BECAUSE OF HOME AND HOUSEHOLD RESPONSIBILITIES -- THE ASSEMBLY BILL -- TWO TWENTY WOULD ALLOW WOMEN AND ALL PARENTS OF YOUNG CHILDREN -- TO BE ABLE TO RUN FOR OFFICE SOONER THAN THEY MIGHT. OTHERWISE IT TOO SO. I'M ALSO AB TWO TWENTY CLARIFY IS A LONGSTANDING OF PPC ADVICE AND I WANT TO PUT INTO CONTEXT WHAT THAT THE ADVICE LETTER THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER BONTA THAT MENTIONED. I'M THE FAIR POLITICAL PRACTICES COMMISSION WHICH REGULATES CAMPAIGN FINANCE CAN ISSUE AND I BY SWEATERS TO ANYBODY WHO ASKS FOR THEM. THESE ARE HELPFUL THEY ARE NOT PRESIDENTIAL. SO WHAT THAT MEANS IS ANY CANDIDATE WHO LATER RELIES ON THE LETTER. COULD BE PROSECUTED BY A COMMISSION COMPRISED OF OF DIFFERENT COMMISSIONERS -- DIFFERENT -- LEGAL COUNSEL ETCETERA -- AND ISRAEL THIS SHOULD NOT ONLY PROVIDES CLARITY FOR THE REGULATED COMMUNITY THERE'S ALSO PROVIDES NEEDED CLARITY TO THE F.

THIS IS A LARGE COMMUNITY THAT HAS EXTORT CLING BEEN EXCLUDED FROM CIVIC PARTICIPATION DUE TO EITHER MISS INFORMATION OR A LACK OF INFORMATION. MANY. WHO ARE BEHIND BARS DO NOT KNOW THAT THEY CAN REGISTER TO VOTE? CURRENT LAW REQUIRES STATE AND LOCAL -- JUVENILE DETENTION FACILITIES TO ASSIST IN BORDER REGISTRATION FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE OF AGE AND ARE NOT SERVING AND I WANT TO UNDERSCORE NOT SERVING A FELONY -- CENTERS THIS BILL WILL. IN ACTS SIMILAR PROVISIONS FOR ADULTS BY REQUIRING EACH COUNTY JAIL TO ALLOW AT LEAST.

NONETHELESS THE EIGHTY THOUSAND PEOPLE WHO ARE INCARCERATED IN COUNTY JAILS FACE A UNIQUE SET OF OBSTACLES WHEN THEY REACH FOR THE BALLOT BOX WE WERE RECENTLY CONTACTED FOR EXAMPLE B A MAN IN A LOCAL JAIL. WHO IS DISENFRANCHISES IN THE LAST ELECTION BECAUSE HE WAS DENIED ACCESS TO A PAN? AB SEVENTY SEVEN WILL HELP CALIFORNIANS IN COUNTY JAILS TO OVERCOME THESE HURDLES. THE BILL ADDRESS OUT REACH TO THE DIVERSE RANGE OF PROGRAMMING THAT COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS ALREADY PROVIDE IN COUNTY JAILS FROM LEGAL AID IN EDUCATION TO SOBRIETY SUPPORT AND RELIGIOUS SERVICES. AS WITH OTHER VOLUNTEER PROGRAM SHERIFF'S RETAIN THE RIGHT TO DENY INDIVIDUAL MEMBERS OF A ORGANIZATIONS IF THEY BOTH HAVE A REASONABLE BASIS TO BELIEVE. THAT THOSE INDIVIDUALS ARE PRESENT A RISK TO THE SECURITY OF THE INSTITUTION. AND AB SEVEN EIGHTY SEVEN PROVIDE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENTS WITH THE FLEXIBILITY TO DECIDE HOW VOTER OUTREACH PROGRAM SHOULD LOOK IN THEIR JAILS. THE LA COUNTY JAIL VOTING PROGRAM FOR INSTANCE -- SHARES COLLABORATE WITH COUNTY ORGANISE COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS AND THE REGISTRAR OF VOTERS TO PROVIDE TRAINED VOLUNTEERS.

WHAT THE SECRETARY OF STATE VOTING IS A FUNDAMENTAL CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT? UNDERSTANDING HOW THE VOTING PROCESS WORKS AND HAVING ABILITY TO VOICE COMMUNITY SUPPORT IN OPPOSITION FOR ELECTED OFFICIALS AND POLICIES THAT IMPACT THE COMMUNITIES IS A VITAL COMP COMP COMPONENT. FOR CIVIC ENGAGEMENT THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE FOR CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE AND WHO HAVE BEEN INCARCERATED CALIFORNIA COURTS TO RACE AGAIN APPROXIMATE EIGHTY THOUSAND PEOPLE. IN ITS JAILS MANY CALIFORNIA'S INVOLVED OR IMPACT ABOUT THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM ARE CONFUSED ABOUT THE STATUS OF THE VOTING RIGHTS EITHER BECAUSE OF MISINFORMATION OR LACK OF INFORMATION.

RIGHT ROCKER WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF COURSE ELECTIONS OFFICIALS WERE MORE OR LESS A TWEENER WE'RE AT SUPPORT OF AMENDED POSITION -- BECAUSE WE HAVE TO PROCESS CONCERNS ABOUT THIS BILL THAT WE'RE STILL WORKING WITH THE AUDITOR'S OFFICE AND WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE AUTHOR AND HIS STAFF FOR WORKING WITH US ON OF THIS CONCERN THANK YOU. THANK YOU -- IN OPPOSITION. THE SPREAD OF OKAY. GOOD MORNING MR CAM MEMBERS WHO SHALL MUCH LOWER ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA STATE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION I RESPECTFULLY IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL. WE HAVE HAD CONVERSATIONS WITH THE AUTHORS OFFICE AND IN YEARS PAST AS WELL -- EXPRESSING ARE ARE WHY WE OPPOSE THIS BILL -- WE CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THE DESIRE ONTO HAD INMATES PARTICIPATE IN THE ELECTORAL PROCESS -- WE BELIEVE THAT THIS BILL LARGELY IGNORES WHAT'S ALREADY BEEN GOING ON AS MENTIONED BY AT THE SUPPORTERS OF THE BILL -- WE ALREADY HAVE IT PRETTY ON THE SHARE MOST SHERIFF'S OFFICES ALREADY HAVE A PRETTY PROACTIVE -- PROCESS IN THEIR JAILS -- BAD WE BELIEVE THAT ALLOWING PERSONS AND GROUPS INTO JAILS AS REQUIRED BY THIS BILL -- WOULD WOULD CRY STAFF TIME AND RESOURCES BECAUSE OF THESE PEOPLE ARE THESE GROUPS THE COMMAND THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO BE ESCORTED AND THEY REQUIRE SUPERVISION -- AND THESE ALL REQUIRE ON RESOURCES AND WE ARE SO WE'RE ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT THE BURDENSOME NATURE OF THE NOTICE AND COMMENT PROCEDURES THAT ARE OUTLINED IN THE BILL. AND FINALLY WE JUST WANNA SAY THAT LIMITING A JAIL STABILITY FOR CRUDE CRUDE CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS OR GROUPS BASED ON THE RISK AT THIS GONNA BE CREATED BY PERSONAL CONTACT WITH INMATES -- IGNORES ANY OTHER SAFETY CONCERNS THAT MIGHT BE RAISED ABOUT THE PERSON IF HE OR SHE DOES NOT PERSONALLY INTERACT WITH INMATES BUT NEVERTHELESS. HAS ACCESS TO THE JAIL AND FOR THESE REASONS WE MUST CONTINUE TO OPPOSE THIS POLICY THANK YOU. THANK YOU BUT IF IT STATE FOR JUST SECOND MAY HAVE SOME QUESTIONS THANKS SPREAD. I YES I'M WITH THE ELECTION INTEGRITY PROJECT CALIFORNIA AND WE OPPOSED AB -- SEVEN EIGHTY SEVEN WE BELIEVE THAT IT WOULD INVADE THE PRIVACY OF THE INMATES AND THESE INSTITUTIONS WOULD EXPOSE THEM TO POLITICAL AND PEER GROUP PRESSURE. OF WE BELIEVE THE TENANTS OF SEVEN EIGHT SEVEN EIGHTY SEVEN PROVIDE THE FOR THE VIOLATION OF CIVIL RIGHTS OF THESE FUTURE VOTERS. AND WOULD SUBJECT THEM TO POTENTIAL MANIPULATION DUE TO THE NATURE OF THE INSTITUTIONAL SITUATION. IN ADDITION THE BILL WOULD OPEN THE DOOR FOR THE REGISTRATION OF NON CITIZENS CRIMINALIZING THEM FURTHER AND IN YOUR VOCAL BILLY HARMING THOSE. ON A LEGITIMATE PATH TO CITIZENSHIP. WE BELIEVE THAT OCEAN -- OPEN REGISTRATION DRIVES IN A RESTRICTED GROUP SITUATION WOULD MAKE PRIVACY IMPOSSIBLE REGISTRANTS WOULD BE WOULD EXPERIENCE UNACCEPTABLE PRESSURE FROM POWER STRUCTURE. IN HERE AMONG INMATES AND REFUGE RED RETRIBUTION WOULD BE CERTAIN. FOR A PRISONER WHO CHOSE TO REGISTER IN A MANNER INCONSISTENT WITH THE DICTATES OF THE DOMINANT INDIVIDUALS WITHIN THE INSTITUTION. ACCORDING TO THE CONGRESSIONAL REGISTER THE POPULATION FOR NON CITIZENS IN U. S. PRISONS IS ESTIMATED TO BE 20% 27% A 94% OF THOSE. ARE IN COUNTY COUNTIES ILLEGAL IN THE COUNTRY ILLEGALLY. IT IS LOGICAL TO ASSUME THAT THOSE PERCENTAGE PERCENTAGES FOR JAILS IN JUVENILE DETENTION CENTERS WOULD BE COMPARE OF ALL. AND THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT THESE NON CITIZENS WOULD BE SWEPT UP IN AN ALL INCLUSIVE REGISTRATION DRIVE. SUCH AS WOULD BE ALLOWED UNDER AB. SEVEN EIGHTY SEVEN YOUR GROUP PRESSURE IN FEAR OF RETALIATION WOULD KEEP THEM FROM SPEAKING UP AND REFUSING TO REGISTER IN ORDER TO RESPECT THE LAW. THE SITUATION VICTIMIZERS THE INMATES BUT ALSO VERY A LAWFUL VOTER OF EVERY LAWFUL VOTER IN THE STATE. EVERY VOTE CAST BY INDIVIDUAL UNLAWFULLY REGISTERED WOULD DILUTE THE VOTES OF THOSE LEGITIMATE CITIZEN VOTERS. INCLUDING THOSE OF THE NEW AND LEGITIMATE INMATE REGISTRANTS. AB SEVEN EIGHTY SEVEN PROVIDES NO STRUCTURE TO PERVERT PREVENT INAPPROPRIATE REGISTRATION OR PROTECTION OF THOSE WHO CANNOT LAWFULLY PARTICIPATE. NOR THOSE WHO SIMPLY CHOOSE NOT TO PARTICIPATE. THE LEGISLATURE WOULD BETTER SERVE THE CITIZEN INMATES WHO TEND TO BE A LOW PROPENSITY VOTERS BY PROVIDING CIVIC EDUCATION. DURING THEIR INCARCERATION INCLUDING ENCOURAGING THEM TO BECOME ACTIVE CITIZENS. PROVIDING THEM NONPARTISAN INFORMATION AND INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO REGISTER ONLINE IN PRIVACY -- I THINK YOU JUST READING THE LETTER NOW RIGHT YES RIGHT. OF THE COUNTRY. TO MANY MET LEASE MINIS OPINION WE ACTUALLY CAN READ OKAY WELL ALL RIGHT -- IF THERE'S ANYTHING YOU WANT TO ADD OKAY TO THE LETTER OKAY NOISE IS SELF EXPLANATORY WE WERE ABLE TO SUBMIT THIS LETTER EARLY FOR YOU TO READ IT SO I JUST WANTED. TO GET INTO THE RECORD ALL RIGHT ANYTHING YOU WANT TO ADD AN ADDITIONAL THAT ARE JUST LAST PARAGRAPH IS IT SO YOU'RE GOOD OKAY. THANK YOU LET ME LET ME ASK SOME QUESTIONS BUT ALL FIRST DEFERRED ANYBODY ELSE THE NIELSEN -- AND ALSO LET ME ASK OTHER MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE WE AFTER -- ASSEMBLYMAN GIBSON CONCLUDES HERE WE HAVE ASSEMBLY WOMAN CAN SALAS AND SHE IS OUR LAST AUTHORS SO IF YOU ARE SENATOR HERTZBERG SENATOR. LIVES BEEN HERE SENATOR STERN -- BE A GOOD TIME TO COME DOWN TO COMMITTEE. SO LET ME ASK YOU -- ASSEMBLYMAN GIBSON IN TERMS OF THE PROGRAM. YOU'RE GONNA CORRECT ME HERE MY UNDERSTANDING IS IS THAT WHEN SOMEONE FROM ONE OF THE VOTER REGISTRATION ORGANIZATIONS COMES TO THE FACILITY. THEY WOULD SIMPLY -- BASICALLY ALERT THOSE WHO ARE THEIR THEIR PRESENT AND IT IT IT'S UP TO THE INCARCERATED PERSON TO DETERMINE WHETHER HE OR SHE WANTS TO VISIT WITH THAT ORGANIZATION IS THAT RIGHT APPS ABSOLUTELY IS. PURELY VOLUNTARILY SO THERE'S NO COERCIVE ACTIVITY THEY'RE NOT FORCED TO COME TO A MEETING ROOM ANY SUCH THING IS THAT RIGHT ABSOLUTELY NOT THEY'RE NOT -- FORCE TO COME TO ANY MEETING ROOM -- THEY CAN REJECT -- SEEING ANY INDIVIDUAL REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION THAT IS NONPARTISAN ALSO I WANT TO MAKE -- MAY HAVE TO OPT IN RIGHT OPTING OUT THAT IS CORRECT RIGHT. ALL RIGHT AND LET ME AS THE IS IT MISS MASTER. THANK MODULAR MODULAR -- ARE THERE ANY OTHER ORGANIZATIONS THAT THAT COME INTO THE FACILITIES FOR EXAMPLE RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATIONS THAT -- MAKES THEMSELVES AVAILABLE TO MEET WITH THOSE WHO ARE INCARCERATED I PRESUME THAT THE IT IS YES. SO SO THE RATHER ORGANIZATIONS THAT THE DO THAT AND HOW DOES THIS YEAR OF DEAL WITH THE CONCERNS YOU JUST REYES CONCERNING SECURITY AND THE LIKE WITH THE OTHER. FOR EXAMPLE RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATIONS WELL THOSE WOULD BE -- DONE ON ON COUNTY BY COUNTY BASIS AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU WHAT EACH SHERIFF DIES TO HANDLE THOSE PARTICULAR SITUATIONS WITH FAITH GROUPS OR OTHER ORGANIZATIONS FOUR EIGHT FOR EXAMPLE A A COMING IN ON EACH COUNTY HANDLES THOSE DIFFERENTLY. SO I DON'T KNOW ANY COUNTY BY COUNTY BASIS HOW THEY DO THOSE SO THAT'S A GOOD EXAMPLE A SO. SO GIVE SAID THAT DOES THIS BILL GIVE. ANY PRIORITY OR GIVE ANY PREFERENCE TO GIVE ANY SPECIAL TREATMENT TO VOTER REGISTRATION ORGANIZATIONS AS OPPOSED TO OTHER GROUPS LIKE LIKE A NO. ABSOLUTELY NOT IS GIVEN SPECIAL PRIVILEGES THERE THE SHERIFF DEPARTMENT WILL AND HAVE ALREADY DEMONSTRATED BY ALLOWING NONPROFITS TO GO IN TO DO THE WORK. PRESS ONLY THIS TAKING PLACE IN OUR JAILS RIGHT NOW AND SO WE WANT TO CONTINUE TO DO THAT THIS WAS WHAT WE HAVE THIS PARTICULAR BILL SO THEY ARE GETTING POORER ANY KIND OF SPECIAL TREATMENT. THE COME INSIDE JUST THERE WAS IN YOUR LINE OF QUESTIONING -- OTHER ORGANIZATIONS RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATIONS OTHERS HAVE THE RIGHT TO GO INSIDE -- AND WITHIN THE OF STAFFING THIS IS DOES NOT INCREASE STAFFING LEVEL FOR TIM TO REMOVE OF THE SHARES OFFER WHATEVER THE ELSE THEY'RE DOING TO COME AND DO THIS KIND OF WORK. IS ALREADY SET UP IN THE JAILS RIGHT NOW. IT DOESN'T REQUIRE ANY SORT OF SPECIAL ACCOMMODATION SO FOR EXAMPLE THE REQUIRE SPECIAL ROOM IS REQUIRES AT ANY SORT OF PETITIONING ANYTHING LIKE THAT. DO YOU KNOW. NOT. FOR SIX THAT WOULD PROBABLY ALSO BE DEPENDENT ON THE COUNTY BUT THE BILL AS IT'S WRITTEN GIVES THE COUNTIES THE FLEXIBILITY TO DESIGN A PROGRAM IN A WAY THAT WORKS BEST FOR THEIR INSTITUTIONS -- PERSONALLY I SPENT SEVERAL YEARS GOING TO SAN FRANCISCO JAIL AND OTHER COUNTY JAILS TEACHING CLASSES ON MARKET CLEARANCE AND FAMILY LAW. AND THOSE ARE DONE IS DIRECTLY IN THE POD WITH STAFF THAT WAS ALREADY GOING TO BE. STAFFING THAT POD. M. THE CONCERNS RAISED ABOUT NON CITIZENS BEING REGISTERED HOW HOW WOULD YOU ADDRESS THAT SOON GIPSON -- TO PREVENT NONSENSE YOU CAN YOU CAN'T VOTE IF YOU'RE A NON CITIZEN YOU DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO TO TO VOTE. SO THEREFORE YOU KNOW TO FILL OUT A VOTER REGISTRATION CARD. IT'LL BE NULL AND VOID. IT WOULD THERE BE ANY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FOR EXAMPLE AT A NON CITIZEN INMATE. FILLING OUT A CARD VERSUS SOMEONE ON THE STREET. IN TERMS OF THE CHECKS AND BALANCES THAT THE HOUSES. ARE. AND WHAT ABOUT FELONS THERE ARE FELONS WHO ARE INCARCERATED IN SOME COUNTY JAILS HOW WOULD. HOW WOULD THEY BE -- PRECLUDED OR EXCLUDED. THE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE SERVING REALIGNMENT FELONY SENTENCES FOR NON SERIOUS NON VIOLENT OR NON SEXUAL. FELONIES ARE PERMITTED TO VOTE IN CALIFORNIA SO THE ONLY PEOPLE WHO ARE IN COUNTY JAILS OR NOT ALLOWED TO VOTE WERE ADULTS ADDISON'S. ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE SERVING STATE FELONY SENTENCES UNDER CONTRACT WITH COUNTY JAILS WHICH IS A VERY A VERY SMALL MINORITY OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE IN COUNTY JAILS AND THE BUT THE JAIL AND THAT INDIVIDUAL SHOULD KNOW. WHO THEY ARE [inaudible] OKAY. THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF PEOPLE IN COUNTY JAIL SCANDAL. GLOBAL THAT RAISES ANOTHER QUESTION IT IS THIS YEAR FOR THE JAILER REQUIRED THEN -- TO DO SOME SORT OF SORTING AS BETWEEN THOSE WHO ARE FELONS OF THOSE OR NON FELONS. THE BILL DOESN'T REQUIRE THAT NOW. OKAY WELL IS THE BILL MOVES FORWARD -- WE WE NEED TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF MAKING SURE THAT FELONS DODD DAHLE REGISTER IF THERE'S SOME OTHER MECHANISM I'M ALBUM TO SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY BUT BUT LIKE TO CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION -- ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT. THOSE WHO WOULD BE LEGALLY INELIGIBLE TO VOTE SOMEHOW COULD HAVE SOME. OF ADVANTAGE FOR EXAMPLE BASED ON THIS PROGRAM LET ME ALSO SAY CENTER THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR QUESTION. IF A PERSON REGISTER TO VOTE pVOTER REGISTRATION CARDS WILL GO TO THE ELECTION OFFICIALS. AND ELECTION OFFICIALS WOULD DO WHAT THEY ALWAYS DO AND THEY WILL VERIFY WHETHER THAT A PERSON ELIGIBLE TO VOTE. AND A PERSON REGISTER TO VOTE WHO'S ON ELIGIBLE VOTER THEN THAT WILL COUNSEL THEM OUT FROM PARTICIPATING IN THAT IN ANY ELECTION. ALL RIGHT ANYBODY OPPOSITION ONE RESPOND IN MY QUESTIONS. NOW AGAIN I WE FEEL THAT THIS IS A MAN. THE BILL REQUIRES CERTAIN STEPS pRESOURCES THAT SHARE SIMPLY DON'T HAVE TO MEET THESE REQUIREMENTS LET ME LET ME GO BACK TO MY ORIGINAL QUESTION THOUGH WHAT WHAT ADDITIONAL RESOURCES WILL BE REQUIRED FOR THIS PROGRAM. THIS ORGANIZATION AS OPPOSED TO A A OR RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATION I CAN PROVIDE THAT FOR YOU ALL RIGHT [inaudible] OKAY. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU APPRECIATE THAT ALL RIGHT OTHER QUESTIONS JUST CENTER NIELSEN. DO THE JAILS HAVE A NO HOSTAGE POLICY SOME OF THEM LIKE CDC ARE. IN OTHER WORDS IF YOU COME IN YOU HAVE TO SIGN A NO HOSTAGE. THE KNOWLEDGE MINT THEY DO. AND WOULD THEY NOT. BE THE COUNTY. TO SOME DEGREE LIABLE. IF SOMETHING HAPPENED. A RIOT THAT SOMEONE GOT INJURED ONE OF THESE VOTER REGISTRATION PEOPLE. I THINK THAT'S A BIG DEAL. BUT WOULD THERE BE ANY DISTINCTION -- THE DISCERN ELSE'S QUESTION OF BETWEEN FOR EXAMPLE SOMEONE WHO'S THERE FOR RELIGIOUS PURPOSES -- AND AS POLLS SOME OF THEIRS FOR VOTER REGISTRATION PURPOSE IN TERMS OF LIABILITY OR HOSTAGE TAKING. I'M NOT AWARE OF THAT BUT I WOULD HAVE TO CHECK INTO THAT FOR YOU. HE WOULD SIGN THE SAME WAIVER I WOULD EXPECT IS THAT RIGHT OKAY [inaudible] THE RIGHT -- BILL'S BEEN MOVED OF SEVEN NUMBER GIVE SOME WAS LIKE CLOSE THIS RESPECTFULLY ASK WHEN I VOTE ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ALL RIGHT IN WILL WITH THE THERE'S A THERE'S A ONE QUESTION REMAINING THAT WILL CONTINUE TO TALK ABOUT. ART. OF BETTER SIR TO BE CALL THE ROLL MOTION IS TO PASS A SET A PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE NUMBER HI. I'M BURKE AYE NIELSEN. NIELSEN NO HERTZBERG LEYVA LEYVA AYE STERN. ALL RIGHT -- WILL LEAVE THE ROLE OPEN. SO -- ASSEMBLY WOMAN GONZALEZ THE MOON GOOD THOUGHTS IS THE LAST AUTHORED TWO DAY. SO WE NEED. OTHER MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE COME DOWN. THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. WE HAVE CAUCUS IN TWELVE MINUTES SO. BE MINDFUL THAT ASSEMBLY WOMAN GONZALEZ ABSOLUTELY RIGHT I START WITH AB. SIX EIGHTY ONE SB SIX EIGHTY ONE YES OKAY AB -- SIXTY EIGHTY ONE IS A SIMPLE BILL TO TRY TO SOLVE SOME THE CONFUSION AND AND VOTER ANGST -- THAT WE SAW DURING THE LAST PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY WE HAVE CONFUSING ROLES -- IF YOU'RE NO PARTY PREFERENCE VOTER YOU MAY OR MAY NOT BE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN A PARTISAN PRIMARY -- BUT YOU STILL HAVE TO TAKE AN ACTIVE STEP OR RE REGISTER -- TO TO PARTICIPATE IN AT LEAST ONE PARTY'S PRIMARY SO WHAT THIS DOES -- IS A IN ORDER SOLVE THIS IS TO NOTIFY THOSE VOTERS THREE TIMES -- TO ALLOW THEM THAT. PROPER NOTICE PRIOR TO RECEIVING AN ABSENTEE BALLOT THAT -- THE WITH NO PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES ON IT THAT THEY WOULD HAVE TO IN FACT TAKE THAT EXTRA STEP -- WE ALSO -- ARE DRESSING A PROBLEM WITH -- CONDITIONAL REGISTRATION AND THAT IF YOU NEED TO CHANGE YOUR PARTY OR ON YOUR ADDRESS. ON THE DAY OF ELECTION I YOU YOU HAVE -- TO VOTE PROVISIONALLY BUT THIS WOULD ALLOW YOU TO DO SO -- AND CAST ACTUAL BALLOT THOSE ARE TWO THINGS THIS BILL DOES IT THINK IT MAKES SENSE IT GIVES THAT EIGHT CLEAR -- UNDERSTANDING FOR ESPECIALLY NONPARTISAN VOTERS IN OUR PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY RESPECTFULLY ASK FROM ABOUT. THANK YOU THE IF ANY WALKING WE HAVE THE SECRETARY STATE FOR REASONS STATED WE SUPPORT THE BILL ALL RIGHT QUESTIONS A WELL I'M SORRY STRIKE THAT -- OTHERS IN SUPPORT.

WERE MISS BRITAIN WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO GET YOU A SEAT A LITTLE CLOSER BUT COME ON UP YES. WHILE YOU'RE MAKING YOUR WAY UP YOUR MISPRINT LET ME ASK THE AUTHOR A QUESTION THIS ONLY APPLIES PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARIES IS THAT RIGHT THAT'S RIGHT OUR THE ONLY PROBLEM WE HAVE WITH. BUT NOT BE ABLE CAST ABOUT AN THROUGH THE CHAIR OF SORRY REALLY QUICKLY TO CLARIFY THE PROCESS OF UPDATING YOUR INFORMATION TO KEEP IT ACCURATE IS ONLY FOR THE VOTERS WHO ARE ALREADY REGISTERED IN THAT COUNTY. OR IN THAT SPECIFIC PRECINCTS SO THERE COULD BE NO CHANCE OF SOMEONE WHO ALREADY RECEIVED A VOTE BY MAIL BALLOT. AND IS EITHER NOT SURRENDERING IT OR THERE IS NOT A COMPREHENSIVE SYSTEM TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT -- BELL IS THE ONLY ONE CAST THERE CAN BE NO OTHER CIRCUMSTANCE OF WHICH THERE ARE TWO BALLOTS PROVIDED TO THAT PERSON. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU. MISS BRITAIN AND GIVE YOU A LETTER. RIGHT SO NOW I WON'T READ IT OF WELL OKAY THANK YOU. AND BY THE WAY I I APPRECIATE THAT THANK YOU DO PUT YOUR TESTIMONY RUNNING -- IN AGAIN COUNTRY TO WHAT SOME MAY BELIEVE I AM CONFIDENT WE ALL CAN READ. AND SOTO THE EXTENT THAT THAT YOU WANTED TO ADD TO WHAT WHAT YOU PROVIDED TO US IN WRITING. PLEASE GO AHEAD OKAY -- A COUPLE THINGS BASICALLY THE THE ARGUMENT BOILED BOILS DOWN TO THE THE FACT THAT. OF THIS PROCEDURE IS ALREADY BEEN DONE THE VOTER IS ALREADY BEING NOTIFIED. AND ONCE IS PROBABLY ENOUGH TO NOTIFY THE PERSON AND THE DOING IT THREE TIMES. IS THE UNDUE BURDEN FINANCIALLY AND LOGISTICALLY FOR THE REGISTER VOTERS IS CLOSE TO ELECTION SO. WE JUST FEEL IT IT'S UNNECESSARY AND COST. COSTS A LOT OF MONEY. FEELS LIKE AN APPROPRIATIONS QUESTION. ALL RIGHT -- ANYTHING ELSE ANY OTHERS IN OPPOSITION QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. NO QUESTIONS OF CENTER LABOR MOVES -- WHICH I CLOSE THEM RESPECT LAST WHEN I MET ALL RIGHT. UNANSWERED IF YOU CALL THE ROLL MOTION IS TO PASS THE SENATE APPROPRIATIONS NUMBER. NUMBER GUY NIELSEN.

SENIOR PARENTS FILED BY POSSIBLY GOING WITH OUR PARENTS ABOUT AND WE'VE SO MANY STUDENTS TODAY WHO -- HAVEN'T HAD THAT EXPERIENCE BECAUSE THEIR PARENTS -- ARE INELIGIBLE TO VOTE OR OR HAVE NOT VOTED SO WE LITERALLY NEED TO TEACH YOUNG PEOPLE AFTER WE'VE DONE ALL THIS WORK TO REGISTER THEM IN AND TO ENSURE THAT IT WE CAN REGISTER THEM IN ANY THE WAY WE NEED TO ACTUALLY TEACH THEM THE MECHANICS. OF HOW TO VOTE THIS IS -- IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND THE SECRETARY OF STATE AND LOCAL AND COUNTY OFFICIALS SO THAT THESE -- NEW VOTERS CAN ONCE THEY ARE ELIGIBLE AT EIGHTEEN FEEL CONFIDENT THAT THEIR THAT THEY KNOW HOW TO GET TO ACCESS NONPARTISAN INFORMATION HOW TO ACCESS THE POLLING LOCATION OR VOTE BY MAIL WHAT THAT BALLOT LOOKS LIKE AND HOW. TO PROPERLY VOTE -- ALTHOUGH I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE. DON'T CONSIDER THIS A AN ISSUE -- THE NUMBER OF YOUNG VOTERS I'VE TALKED TO HAVE BEEN INTIMIDATED BY THE VOTING PROCESS OUT OF JUST A BASIC CIVICS LESSON -- THAT COULD BE SOLVED AND THAT'S WHAT E'RE HOPING TO DO HERE RESPECT LAST FOR AN AYE VOTE HAVE A COUPLE PEOPLE IN SUPPORT.
