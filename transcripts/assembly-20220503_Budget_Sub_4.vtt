00:47:56.240 --> 00:47:57.741
OWNERS HAVE BEEN VICTIMS OF

00:47:57.808 --> 00:47:59.676
RETAIL THEFT. AND AS WE NOTED IN

00:47:59.743 --> 00:48:01.211
FEBRUARY IMPLEMENTING THIS

00:48:01.278 --> 00:48:02.813
CONCEPT WOULD FACE A LOT OF

00:48:02.879 --> 00:48:05.549
PRACTICAL CHALLENGES AND- AT

00:48:05.616 --> 00:48:06.483
THAT TIME WE HIGHLIGHTED IN

00:48:06.550 --> 00:48:08.151
PARTICULAR HOW IT WOULD BE

00:48:08.218 --> 00:48:08.986
DIFFICULT TO DEFINE THE

00:48:09.052 --> 00:48:11.121
ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA AND HOW

00:48:11.188 --> 00:48:12.689
BEST TO DOCUMENT LOSSES THAT

00:48:12.756 --> 00:48:13.690
BUSINESS OWNERS EXPERIENCE

00:48:13.757 --> 00:48:15.459
RETAIL THEFT AND- AFTER

00:48:15.525 --> 00:48:17.227
REVIEWING THE TRAILER BILL

00:48:17.294 --> 00:48:18.829
LANGUAGE AND MEETING WITH THE

00:48:18.895 --> 00:48:19.663
GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF BUSINESS

00:48:19.730 --> 00:48:21.198
AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. AND

00:48:21.265 --> 00:48:22.899
THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IT WAS

00:48:22.966 --> 00:48:24.501
CLEAR THAT THE ADMINISTRATION

00:48:24.568 --> 00:48:25.469
HAS GRAPPLED WITH THESE

00:48:25.535 --> 00:48:26.870
CHALLENGES AND HAVE THOUGHTFULLY

00:48:26.937 --> 00:48:28.238
ATTEMPTED TO BALANCE THE

00:48:28.305 --> 00:48:29.973
PROGRAM'S REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE

00:48:30.040 --> 00:48:32.042
IN CONFLICT IS UNDETERMINED GRAY

00:48:32.109 --> 00:48:35.779
HAD JUST. OUTLINED FOR YOU SO

00:48:35.846 --> 00:48:37.281
FOR EXAMPLE THE PROGRAM WILL

00:48:37.347 --> 00:48:39.449
NEED TO REQUIRE DOCUMENTATION OF

00:48:39.516 --> 00:48:41.051
A CRIM TO REDUCE THE LIKELIHOOD

00:48:41.118 --> 00:48:42.619
OF FRAUD WHILE ALSO BEING

00:48:42.686 --> 00:48:46.189
FLEXIBLE AND SIMPLE ENOUGH TO

00:48:46.256 --> 00:48:47.190
MINIMIZE THE BURDEN ON

00:48:47.257 --> 00:48:49.760
APPLICANTS. NONETHELESS WE KNOW

00:48:49.826 --> 00:48:51.161
THAT THE DEFINITION OF RETAIL

00:48:51.228 --> 00:48:52.829
THEFT AND THE ELIGIBILITY

00:48:52.896 --> 00:48:55.632
CRITERIA ARE BOTH QUITE BROAD.

00:48:55.699 --> 00:48:58.302
AND THIS RAISES TWO MAJOR

00:48:58.368 --> 00:49:00.237
CONCERNS FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION

00:49:00.304 --> 00:49:01.705
. FIRST WE BELIEVE THE PROGRAM

00:49:01.772 --> 00:49:03.774
WILL BE QUICKLY OVERSUBSCRIBED

00:49:03.840 --> 00:49:05.609
AND SECOND IT SEEMS LIKELY THAT

00:49:05.676 --> 00:49:07.744
THE PROGRAM MAY NOT PROVIDE

00:49:07.811 --> 00:49:09.646
ASSISTANCE TO THE BUSINESSES

00:49:09.713 --> 00:49:11.748
THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE IN MIND AS

00:49:11.815 --> 00:49:14.084
INTENDED. SOME OF THE TWENTY

00:49:14.151 --> 00:49:15.852
MILLION THAT THE ADMINISTRATION

00:49:15.919 --> 00:49:17.988
HAS PROPOSED FOR THIS PROGRAM-

00:49:18.055 --> 00:49:19.856
IN DOLLARS WOULD BE RESERVED FOR

00:49:19.923 --> 00:49:21.992
ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES LEAVING

00:49:22.059 --> 00:49:22.993
SEVENTEEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR

00:49:23.060 --> 00:49:25.996
GRANTS. SO WE DID SOME MATH AND

00:49:26.063 --> 00:49:28.498
THAT'S AT AN AVERAGE GRANT

00:49:28.565 --> 00:49:30.100
FIFTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS WE

00:49:30.167 --> 00:49:31.001
ESTIMATE THAT THE PROGRAM WOULD

00:49:31.068 --> 00:49:33.303
AWARD FEWER THAN ONE THOUSAND

00:49:33.370 --> 00:49:35.839
TWO HUNDRED GRANTS. SO GIVEN THE

00:49:35.906 --> 00:49:37.874
BROAD ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA WE

00:49:37.941 --> 00:49:39.976
WOULD EXPECT THE PROGRAM WOULD

00:49:40.043 --> 00:49:41.778
BECOME QUICKLY OVERSUBSCRIBED.

00:49:41.845 --> 00:49:43.880
HOWEVER WE SHOULD NOTE THAT

00:49:43.947 --> 00:49:45.382
NEITHER WE- NOR THE

00:49:45.449 --> 00:49:47.417
ADMINISTRATION HAS CONDUCTED AN

00:49:47.484 --> 00:49:49.086
ANALYSIS OF THE NUMBER OF SMALL

00:49:49.152 --> 00:49:51.154
BUSINESSES THAT ARE VICTIMS OF

00:49:51.221 --> 00:49:53.657
THEFT ARSON AND VANDALISM. SO WE

00:49:53.724 --> 00:49:56.226
DON'T KNOW FOR SURE EXACTLY WHAT

00:49:56.293 --> 00:49:57.394
THE DEMAND FOR THE PROGRAM WILL

00:49:57.461 --> 00:50:00.897
BE. AND WHEN I SAY SMALL

00:50:00.964 --> 00:50:02.632
BUSINESSES I MEAN THAT GENERALLY

00:50:02.699 --> 00:50:04.301
BECAUSE IT WOULD APPEAR THAT

00:50:04.368 --> 00:50:06.136
ALMOST ANY OTHER ANY BUSINESS

00:50:06.203 --> 00:50:08.538
NOT JUST RETAILERS IT'S A VICTIM

00:50:08.605 --> 00:50:10.841
OF PROPERTY DAMAGE. OR THEFT-

00:50:10.907 --> 00:50:13.043
ARSON OR VANDALISM WOULD LIKELY

00:50:13.110 --> 00:50:15.445
BE ELIGIBLE FOR THIS GRANT. AND

00:50:15.512 --> 00:50:18.048
SO RETAILERS THE ONLY COMPRISE.

00:50:18.115 --> 00:50:19.916
MORE PORTION OF THOSE BUSINESSES

00:50:19.983 --> 00:50:23.186
THAT ARE ABLE TO SECURE GRANT

00:50:23.253 --> 00:50:25.088
BEFORE FUNDING IS EXHAUSTED.

00:50:25.155 --> 00:50:26.590
GIVEN THESE POTENTIAL OUTCOMES

00:50:26.656 --> 00:50:27.724
WE ARE CONCERNED THAT BY

00:50:27.791 --> 00:50:29.793
CREATING THIS PROGRAM YOU COULD

00:50:29.860 --> 00:50:31.395
FIND YOURSELF IN A SITUATION

00:50:31.461 --> 00:50:34.398
WHERE DOWN THE ROAD- SIMILARLY

00:50:34.464 --> 00:50:35.699
TO THE SMALL BUSINESS PROVE IT

00:50:35.766 --> 00:50:37.534
RELIEF GRANT PROGRAM. WHERE

00:50:37.601 --> 00:50:39.202
MULTIPLE ADDITIONAL ROUNDS OF

00:50:39.269 --> 00:50:40.871
FUNDING ARE REQUIRED TO MEET THE

00:50:40.937 --> 00:50:43.573
DEMANDS. OF LESLIE WERE

00:50:43.640 --> 00:50:45.175
CONCERNED THAT THE PROGRAM IS

00:50:45.242 --> 00:50:46.843
RELATIVELY EXPENSIVE SIMILAR

00:50:46.910 --> 00:50:48.378
PROGRAMS HAVE COSTS OF ONLY

00:50:48.445 --> 00:50:52.048
AROUND 5% RELATIVE TO THE 15%

00:50:52.115 --> 00:50:53.917
SET ASIDE FOR THIS PROGRAM.

00:50:53.984 --> 00:50:55.619
GIVEN THE CHALLENGES POSED BY

00:50:55.685 --> 00:50:56.319
SETTING UP A NEW COMPLICATED

00:50:56.386 --> 00:50:59.956
PROGRAM THIS 50% OF THE TWENTY

00:51:00.023 --> 00:51:00.991
MILLION MAY NOT BEYOND

00:51:01.057 --> 00:51:03.026
REASONABLE AT ALL. BUT IT DOES-

00:51:03.093 --> 00:51:04.327
AND FORMER ASSESSMENT OF ITS

00:51:04.394 --> 00:51:07.197
LIKELY COST EFFECTIVENESS- GIVEN

00:51:07.264 --> 00:51:09.900
OUR PRIOR- ESTIMATION OF THE

00:51:09.966 --> 00:51:11.201
AMOUNT OF GRANTS THAT WOULD BE

00:51:11.268 --> 00:51:14.004
SUPPORTIVE OF THIS PROGRAM THAT

00:51:14.070 --> 00:51:16.072
WORKS OUT TO OVER TWO THOUSAND

00:51:16.139 --> 00:51:17.040
FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS AND

00:51:17.107 --> 00:51:17.908
ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES PER

00:51:17.974 --> 00:51:19.876
GRANT. YOU WANT TO CONCLUDE BY

GUIDANCE THAT WE PROVIDED IN

00:51:21.878 --> 00:51:23.480
FEBRUARY. THE YOU CONSIDER

00:51:23.547 --> 00:51:25.415
WHETHER THE GOAL OF THIS

00:51:25.482 --> 00:51:26.817
PROPOSAL IS CONSISTENT WITH YOUR

00:51:26.883 --> 00:51:29.052
BROADER PUBLIC SAFETY. OR

00:51:29.119 --> 00:51:30.821
PERHAPS IN THIS CASE ECONOMIC

00:51:30.887 --> 00:51:32.456
DEVELOPMENT PRIORITIES. THAT

00:51:32.522 --> 00:51:35.725
CONCLUDES OUR COMMENTS THANK YOU

00:51:35.792 --> 00:51:36.693

I REMAIN SOMETHING

00:51:45.402 --> 00:51:46.102
ADMINISTRATION IS CONCERNED

00:51:46.169 --> 00:51:47.771
ABOUT THIS PROGRAM IS INTENDED

00:51:47.838 --> 00:51:49.239

00:51:57.414 --> 00:51:59.416
QUESTIONS. WITH THE RETAIL THEFT

00:51:59.483 --> 00:52:01.485
PROGRAM IS STRUCTURED SIMILARLY

00:52:01.551 --> 00:52:02.419
TO THE SMALL BUSINESS GRANTS

00:52:02.486 --> 00:52:04.354
FROM LAST YEAR MEANING WILL A

00:52:04.421 --> 00:52:05.589

GRANTS OR WILL GO THIS. THANK

00:52:08.024 --> 00:52:10.126
YOU FOR THE QUESTION. SO AS AS

00:52:10.193 --> 00:52:12.028
THE DIRECTOR GRAY MENTIONED THIS

00:52:12.095 --> 00:52:14.764
IS EXPRESSLY WE USE THE COVERED

00:52:14.831 --> 00:52:16.967
RELIEF GRANT PROGRAM AS A MODEL.

00:52:17.033 --> 00:52:20.103
THE BUCKETS OF MAKING SO ANNUAL

00:52:20.170 --> 00:52:22.305
GROSS REVENUE PUTS DIFFERENT

00:52:22.372 --> 00:52:24.040
SMALL BUSINESSES BY SIZE AND-

00:52:24.107 --> 00:52:25.308
CATEGORY AND THEN GET A GRANT

00:52:25.375 --> 00:52:26.910
BASED ON THAT. THAT'S WHERE THAT

00:52:26.977 --> 00:52:28.745
STRUCTURE CAME FROM THE SAME

00:52:28.812 --> 00:52:30.647
THING FOR IMPLEMENTATION. SO WE

00:52:30.714 --> 00:52:31.548
WOULD DO A COMPETITIVE BIDDING

00:52:31.615 --> 00:52:33.850
PROCESS- WE'VE NOW HAVE MORE

00:52:33.917 --> 00:52:34.885
EXPERIENCE THAN WE EVEN DID TWO

00:52:34.951 --> 00:52:36.853
YEARS AGO SO WE'RE CONFIDENT.

00:52:36.920 --> 00:52:38.855
THAT THERE ARE- PROVIDERS OUT

00:52:38.922 --> 00:52:41.691
THERE THAT COULD HELP US WITH

00:52:41.758 --> 00:52:44.094
THIS- AT THE SO BASED ON OUR

00:52:44.160 --> 00:52:45.562
EXPERIENCE WE SEE THIS WORKING

00:52:45.629 --> 00:52:46.930
THROUGH THAT MODEL. AND IF I'M

00:52:46.997 --> 00:52:48.865
JUST A FOLLOW UP TO THAT HOW

00:52:48.932 --> 00:52:50.333
MANY GRANTS ONE OUT RECORDED

00:52:50.400 --> 00:52:53.737
RELIEF. DIRECTOR GRADE DO YOU

00:52:53.803 --> 00:52:55.739
HAVE THE LATEST AYE AYE IT'S

00:52:55.805 --> 00:52:57.507
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS- SO I'M

00:52:57.574 --> 00:52:59.609
NOT SURE DIRECTOR GRAY HAS HAS A

00:52:59.676 --> 00:53:01.945
OFF THE TOP OF HER HEAD- A ROUGH

00:53:02.012 --> 00:53:11.187
START. EDS ARE LASTER REPORT HAD. THREE HUNDRED FIFTEEN THOUSAND

00:53:11.254 --> 00:53:12.822
THREE HUNDRED FIFTEEN. GRATZ I'M

00:53:12.889 --> 00:53:14.691
SORRY ONE MORE TIME HOW MANY.

00:53:14.758 --> 00:53:19.930
YES. THREE HUNDRED FIFTEEN

00:53:19.996 --> 00:53:20.964
THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED FIFTEEN

00:53:21.031 --> 00:53:23.800
FRANCE AND I CANNOT HOLD STAFF

00:53:23.867 --> 00:53:26.069
DID TO SEE WHETHER I CAN GET IT

00:53:26.136 --> 00:53:29.539
MORE ACCURATE A NUMBER OF BUT

00:53:29.606 --> 00:53:30.874
THAT IS WHAT WE DID IN OUR LAST

00:53:30.941 --> 00:53:33.743
REPORT. SO ACCORDING TO THE L.

00:53:33.810 --> 00:53:36.980
A. O. THIS THIS WOULD ACTUALLY

00:53:37.047 --> 00:53:38.515
JUST AWARD ABOUT TWELVE HUNDRED

00:53:38.582 --> 00:53:43.753
GRAMS. THAT'S CORRECT THE SIZE

00:53:43.820 --> 00:53:45.155
AS THE L. A. O. NOTED WELL

00:53:45.221 --> 00:53:48.658
THAT'S TO- TO REINSTATE WHAT MY

00:53:48.725 --> 00:53:50.327
COLLEAGUE MISTER WEATHERFORD DID

00:53:50.393 --> 00:53:52.095
SAY BOTH OURSELVES IN THE ALLEY-

00:53:52.162 --> 00:53:54.130
DON'T HAVE A VERY PRECISE VISION

00:53:54.197 --> 00:53:56.132
OF WHAT THE FIRST LOOK LIKE. WE

00:53:56.199 --> 00:53:57.567
WOULD RECOGNIZE THAT THAT

00:53:57.634 --> 00:54:00.403
ESTIMATE IS BROADLY ON TRACK SO

00:54:00.470 --> 00:54:03.440
HOUSE AND- OR MORE. SO IN

00:54:03.506 --> 00:54:05.308
MAGNITUDE IT'S DIFFERENT- BUT

00:54:05.375 --> 00:54:09.212
AGAIN. AS AS HE ALSO BROUGHT UP

00:54:09.279 --> 00:54:10.714
THE ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS IS A

00:54:10.780 --> 00:54:12.215
DIFFERENT STRUCTURE TO WHAT WE

00:54:12.282 --> 00:54:15.485
ORIGINALLY DID WITH THE CODE

00:54:15.552 --> 00:54:16.052
RELIEF GRANT PROGRAM THAT'S

00:54:16.119 --> 00:54:19.589
BECAUSE THIS IS ESSENTIALLY- TO

00:54:19.656 --> 00:54:21.858
ADDRESS A PROBLEM THAT'S THAT'S

00:54:21.925 --> 00:54:23.426
MORE COMPLEX ADMINISTRATIVELY.

00:54:23.493 --> 00:54:24.961
THAN THE COVERED RELIEF GRANT

00:54:25.028 --> 00:54:26.830
WHICH WAS MORE BROAD BASED THIS

00:54:26.896 --> 00:54:29.032
IS A SPECIFIC IMPACT THAT

00:54:29.099 --> 00:54:31.167
BUSINESSES WOULD. WOULD HAVE SO

00:54:31.234 --> 00:54:32.669
IT'S NOT HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS

00:54:32.736 --> 00:54:35.271
OF BUSINESSES THAT WOULD BE

00:54:35.338 --> 00:54:37.340
IMPACTED- SO WILL WILL

00:54:37.407 --> 00:54:39.609
ACKNOWLEDGE THE POINT- THAT

00:54:39.676 --> 00:54:41.244
THERE'S A MAGNITUDE DIFFERENCE.

00:54:41.311 --> 00:54:43.313
SO WITH THERE SEEMS TO BE

00:54:43.380 --> 00:54:45.148
AGREEMENT THAT PERHAPS A TWELVE

00:54:45.215 --> 00:54:46.182
HUNDRED OF HUNDRED BUSINESSES

00:54:46.249 --> 00:54:49.252
THAT WOULD BENEFIT. SEEMS TO BE

00:54:49.319 --> 00:54:51.087
AN APPROPRIATE NUMBER SO HOW DID

00:54:51.154 --> 00:54:53.089
CODE BIS. PROGRAM TO DETERMINE

00:54:53.156 --> 00:54:55.125
THE TWENTY MILLION WOULD BE THE

00:54:55.191 --> 00:54:58.094
APPROPRIATE SIZE OF THE PROGRAM

00:54:58.161 --> 00:55:00.030
. THANK YOU FOR THAT THE TWELVE

00:55:00.096 --> 00:55:01.798
HUNDRED- THAT IS THAT'S NOT

00:55:01.865 --> 00:55:03.900
WHERE WE A MATCH AND WE DON'T

00:55:03.967 --> 00:55:05.335
HAVE A PRECISE. VISION WE THINK

00:55:05.402 --> 00:55:07.404
THAT'S PROBABLY THE MINIMUM THAT

00:55:07.470 --> 00:55:09.406
WOULD WOULD BENEFIT. THE

00:55:09.472 --> 00:55:10.874
ESTIMATE WAS BASED ON ONE

00:55:10.940 --> 00:55:12.509
AVAILABLE RESOURCES IN OTHER

00:55:12.575 --> 00:55:15.145
ADMINISTRATIONS. ONE OF THE BIG

00:55:15.211 --> 00:55:18.248
THEMES AS FISCAL RESILIENCY-

00:55:18.314 --> 00:55:20.417
WE'RE TRYING TO. BALANCE THE

00:55:20.483 --> 00:55:23.219
TRADE OFF OF THE TO REAL NEED

00:55:23.286 --> 00:55:24.688
OUT THERE. WITH WHAT CAN WE DO

00:55:24.754 --> 00:55:26.656
BILL AND SO THERE'S VARIOUS

00:55:26.723 --> 00:55:34.030
APPROACHES. TO WE THINK THIS IS

00:55:34.097 --> 00:55:36.399
A REASONABLE APPROACH WE THINK.

00:55:36.466 --> 00:55:39.636
WITH GRANT AMOUNTS OF THIS SIZE.

00:55:39.703 --> 00:55:41.538
WE WOULD HAVE SOME LEGITIMATE

00:55:41.604 --> 00:55:43.006
SUBSTANTIAL FINANCIAL BENEFIT TO

00:55:43.073 --> 00:55:44.974
THOSE. WE WOULD KEEP THEM

00:55:45.041 --> 00:55:46.876
OPERATIONALLY AND FINANCIALLY

00:55:46.943 --> 00:55:49.646
AFLOAT- WHEN THEY'RE AT RISK OF.

00:55:49.713 --> 00:55:51.715
OF BEING- YOU KNOW CLOSING THEIR

00:55:51.781 --> 00:55:54.050
DOORS AND POTENTIALLY NOT COMING

00:55:54.117 --> 00:55:55.618
BACK FROM THIS SO THAT WAS THE

00:55:55.685 --> 00:55:59.255
UNDERLYING GOAL HERE- WE- USE

00:55:59.322 --> 00:56:00.857
OUR BEST ESTIMATE FOR TWENTY

00:56:00.924 --> 00:56:03.026
MILLION ESSENTIALLY. WELL LET'S

00:56:03.093 --> 00:56:05.395
DIVE DEEP ARE A LITTLE BIT INTO

00:56:05.462 --> 00:56:07.497
FISCAL RESILIENCY IN FUNDING

00:56:07.564 --> 00:56:09.566
BENEFITS. WHERE THE GRANTS

00:56:09.632 --> 00:56:11.201
AWARDED BY THE SIZE OF THE

00:56:11.267 --> 00:56:12.936
BUSINESS VERSUS THE AMOUNT OF ON

00:56:13.002 --> 00:56:14.704
COVERED LOSSES TO THE BUSINESS

00:56:14.771 --> 00:56:17.941
FOR EXAMPLE A BUSINESS THAT MADE

00:56:18.007 --> 00:56:19.242
ONE MILLION DOLLARS ON THEIR

00:56:19.309 --> 00:56:21.311
LAST TAX RETURN BUT HAD A RETAIL

00:56:21.377 --> 00:56:23.513
THEFT FIVE THOUSAND. UNDER THIS

00:56:23.580 --> 00:56:26.583
PROPOSAL IT WOULD BE AWARDED

00:56:26.649 --> 00:56:27.217
TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS IN

00:56:27.283 --> 00:56:29.953
A GROUND FORCES THE FIVE

00:56:30.019 --> 00:56:32.722
THOUSAND IN THE RETAIL THEFT.

00:56:32.789 --> 00:56:34.557
THAT'S A THAT'S A GOOD WE

00:56:34.624 --> 00:56:36.059
ACKNOWLEDGE THE COMPLEXITY THERE

00:56:36.126 --> 00:56:38.561
IN TERMS OF TRYING TO MATCH THE

00:56:38.628 --> 00:56:41.931
AVAILABLE STATE RESOURCES WITH.

00:56:41.998 --> 00:56:44.467
ME THAT A BUSINESS SIX. WE HAVE

00:56:44.534 --> 00:56:46.870
TALKED L. L. ABOUT THAT AND- AS

00:56:46.936 --> 00:56:48.204
AS MR WHETHER NOTED WE GRAPPLE

00:56:48.271 --> 00:56:50.273
WITH THAT OVER THE LAST COUPLE

00:56:50.340 --> 00:56:51.241
MONTHS AND FROM OUR VIEW WHERE

00:56:51.307 --> 00:56:54.978
LAND HERE. THIS THE ONE WAY TO

00:56:55.044 --> 00:56:55.945
DO THIS PROGRAM YOU OFFER

00:56:56.012 --> 00:56:57.947
EVERYONE THE SAME FLAT AMOUNT OF

00:56:58.014 --> 00:56:59.983
RELIEF. THAT WOULD BE

00:57:00.049 --> 00:57:02.719
INEQUITABLE IN OUR VIEW- THE

00:57:02.786 --> 00:57:03.987
OTHER THING YOU COULD DO IS YOU

00:57:04.053 --> 00:57:06.222
COULD TRY TO DETAIL THE DOLLAR

00:57:06.289 --> 00:57:08.124
BY DOLLAR AMOUNT OF A- OF A

00:57:08.191 --> 00:57:09.993
REVENUE IMPACT THEIR BUSINESS

00:57:10.059 --> 00:57:12.695
EXPERIENCES. FROM OUR VIEW

00:57:12.762 --> 00:57:13.530
THAT'S ADMINISTRATIVELY

00:57:13.596 --> 00:57:15.799
UNREALISTIC AND GETS MORE

00:57:15.865 --> 00:57:18.968
COMPLEX AND EXPENSIVE- SO. WE

00:57:19.035 --> 00:57:22.105
TRIED TO. BALANCE THAT AND WHERE

00:57:22.172 --> 00:57:25.575
WE LANDED WAS THIS WAY BY USING

00:57:25.642 --> 00:57:27.577
ANNUAL GROSS REVENUE AS THE

00:57:27.644 --> 00:57:29.746
DEFINING THE BUCKETS AND THEN

00:57:29.813 --> 00:57:33.316
ALSO DEFINING. FREE FIXED GRANT

00:57:33.383 --> 00:57:35.919
AMOUNTS THAT SIMPLIFIES FOR BOTH

00:57:35.985 --> 00:57:38.354
OURSELVES AS THE ADMINISTRATORS

00:57:38.421 --> 00:57:40.757
THAT ALSO SIMPLIFIES INTERVIEW

00:57:40.824 --> 00:57:42.692
FOR THE SMALL BUSINESSES WHO. IT

00:57:42.759 --> 00:57:44.227
CAN BE DIFFICULT TO DOCUMENT

00:57:44.294 --> 00:57:47.397
YOUR DOLLAR BY DOLLAR IMPACT- SO

00:57:47.463 --> 00:57:49.299
THIS IS BASICALLY A ATTEMPT TO

00:57:49.365 --> 00:57:52.368
BALANCE. YEAH I'D YOU KNOW I'M

00:57:52.435 --> 00:57:53.903
I'M HAVING A HARD TIME

00:57:53.970 --> 00:57:55.605
UNDERSTANDING WHY WE WOULD USE

00:57:55.672 --> 00:57:58.641
TAX DOLLARS ARE PUBLIC DOLLARS

00:57:58.708 --> 00:57:59.943
TO AWARD SOMEONE TWENTY FIVE

00:58:00.009 --> 00:58:01.778
THOUSAND DOLLARS WHEN THEY ONLY

00:58:01.845 --> 00:58:03.413
HAD FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS WORTH

00:58:03.479 --> 00:58:05.548
OF. RETAIL THEFT I'M NOT SURE.

00:58:05.615 --> 00:58:08.384
THAT THE MATH ADDS UP. I'LL JUST

00:58:08.451 --> 00:58:09.719
MAKE ONE MORE POINT WHICH IS-

00:58:09.786 --> 00:58:11.421
AND I WOULD TAKE WITH KNOWLEDGE

00:58:11.487 --> 00:58:14.023
THAT CONCERNED. WOULD SAY THAT

00:58:14.090 --> 00:58:15.558
IN THIS LANGUAGE WHAT WE'VE DONE

00:58:15.625 --> 00:58:16.993
TO MITIGATE THAT IS REQUIRED

00:58:17.060 --> 00:58:19.796
THAT. THE ONLY USE THAT A

00:58:19.863 --> 00:58:21.464
GRANTEE CAN MAKE OF THESE

00:58:21.531 --> 00:58:24.634
DOLLARS. IS TOWARDS OF. A AN

00:58:24.701 --> 00:58:27.570
EXPENSE THAT WAS NOT COVERED BY

00:58:27.637 --> 00:58:28.671
AN EXISTING INSURANCE CLAIMS. SO

00:58:28.738 --> 00:58:30.640
ESSENTIALLY IF YOU'RE A LARGE

00:58:30.707 --> 00:58:31.774
BUSINESS IN THE EXAMPLE YOU

00:58:31.841 --> 00:58:34.744
GAVE- THEY'VE ALREADY. IN ALL

00:58:34.811 --> 00:58:36.479
LIKELIHOOD IF THEY'RE ON THE

00:58:36.546 --> 00:58:38.715
LARGER- THE HIGHER SCALE THESE

00:58:38.781 --> 00:58:40.283
ANNUAL REVENUES. THEY PROBABLY

00:58:40.350 --> 00:58:41.718
HAVE INSURANCE AND THEY PROBABLY

00:58:41.784 --> 00:58:43.319
HAVE THE CAPACITY TO SORT OF

00:58:43.386 --> 00:58:46.589
MAXIMIZE THEIR INSURANCE CLAIM.

00:58:46.656 --> 00:58:48.958
AND SO THIS WOULD SUPPORT THEM-

00:58:49.025 --> 00:58:50.994
AND SORT OF FILL IN A GAP ON

00:58:51.060 --> 00:58:52.028
POTENTIALLY REVENUE LOSS FROM

00:58:52.095 --> 00:58:53.029
CLOSED DOORS OF THAT SORTOF

00:58:53.096 --> 00:58:56.532
THING. SO WE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT

00:58:56.599 --> 00:58:58.268
BUT WOULD WE'VE DONE OUR OUR- WE

00:58:58.334 --> 00:59:00.370
OFFERED WHAT WE THINK IS A

00:59:00.436 --> 00:59:02.405
REASONABLE APPROACH TO MITIGATE

00:59:02.472 --> 00:59:04.173
. IS IN THE INTENT OF THIS

00:59:04.240 --> 00:59:04.874
PROPOSAL TO SUPPORT SMALL

00:59:04.941 --> 00:59:06.843
BUSINESSES THOUGH YOU JUST

00:59:06.910 --> 00:59:09.979
TALKED ABOUT LARGE BUSINESSES.

00:59:10.046 --> 00:59:12.515
I'LL CLARIFY THAT THAT'S IN THE

00:59:12.582 --> 00:59:13.283
SCALE OF THE THREE REVENUE

00:59:13.349 --> 00:59:15.318
BUCKETS I MEANT THE EXAMPLE YOU

00:59:15.385 --> 00:59:16.786
GAVE WAS FROM WHAT IF A

00:59:16.853 --> 00:59:19.422
BUSINESS. THAT'S A YOU KNOW

00:59:19.489 --> 00:59:21.090
THREE MILLION ANNUAL REVENUE

00:59:21.157 --> 00:59:24.560
THAT BUSINESS IS LARGER THAN.

00:59:24.627 --> 00:59:25.695
THE BUSINESS WITH A HUNDRED

00:59:25.762 --> 00:59:27.163
THOUSAND. BUT IN THE GRAND

00:59:27.230 --> 00:59:29.098
SCHEME OF CALIFORNIA. THE

00:59:29.165 --> 00:59:30.967
CALIFORNIA ECONOMY THAT'S CAN

00:59:31.034 --> 00:59:34.470
STILL BE A SMALL BUSINESS- IT'S

00:59:34.537 --> 00:59:35.905
BROADLY SIMILAR TO THE COVERED

00:59:35.972 --> 00:59:37.840
RELIEF GRANT IN THAT WAY IN

00:59:37.907 --> 00:59:39.976
TERMS OF THRESHOLD OKAY AS I'VE

00:59:40.043 --> 00:59:41.778
I DID SAY ONE MILLION NOT THREE

00:59:41.844 --> 00:59:43.513
BUT THAT'S OKAY I UNDERSTAND

00:59:43.579 --> 00:59:44.547
WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO CONVEY. I

00:59:44.614 --> 00:59:46.382
DO HAVE A COUPLE MORE QUESTIONS

00:59:46.449 --> 00:59:48.618
BUT I DO WANT TO OPEN IT UP TO

00:59:48.685 --> 00:59:50.386
MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE IF THEY

00:59:50.453 --> 00:59:51.721
WOULD LIKE TO ASK ANYTHING ELSE.

00:59:51.788 --> 00:59:53.389
I WANTED TO- JUST ASK A LITTLE

00:59:53.456 --> 00:59:54.991
BIT ABOUT OUTRAGE SO IS IT A

00:59:55.058 --> 00:59:56.526
FIRST COME FIRST SERVED SURFERS

00:59:56.592 --> 00:59:59.128
ARE SERVE BASIS WILL THE OUT

00:59:59.195 --> 01:00:01.497
REACH FOR THE PROGRAM- BE OPEN

01:00:01.564 --> 01:00:02.765
AHEAD OF TIME HOW WILL WE ENSURE

01:00:02.832 --> 01:00:05.635
THAT THE FUNDS ARE DISTRIBUTED

01:00:05.702 --> 01:00:07.637
ON AN EQUITABLE BASIS. RESHOOT

01:00:07.704 --> 01:00:09.539
THAT THAT QUESTION THIS IS

01:00:09.605 --> 01:00:10.873
SOMETHING THAT WE'VE GRAPPLED

01:00:10.940 --> 01:00:13.609
WITH AND- AS THE DRESS DIRECTOR

01:00:13.676 --> 01:00:16.579
GRAY MENTIONED THIS IS OUR

01:00:16.646 --> 01:00:18.915
EFFICIENCY HERE WHERE. IF WE

01:00:18.982 --> 01:00:22.452
START TO ADD FILTERS ON WHO'S

01:00:22.518 --> 01:00:26.022
ELIGIBLE AND WE TRY TO SAY LET'S

01:00:26.089 --> 01:00:28.825
PRIORITIZE ACTS BY GEOGRAPHY WHY

01:00:28.891 --> 01:00:31.594
BY- SOME DEMOGRAPHIC DATA. THE

01:00:31.661 --> 01:00:33.329
PROBLEM IS FOR BOTH THE SMALL

01:00:33.396 --> 01:00:35.098
BUSINESS THAT CREATES AN ADDED

01:00:35.164 --> 01:00:38.134
BURDEN OF TRYING TO JUMP THROUGH

01:00:38.201 --> 01:00:39.168
THE HOOP AND PROVE THAT YOU FALL

01:00:39.235 --> 01:00:41.537
INTO THAT. AND ALSO FOR THE

01:00:41.604 --> 01:00:42.271
ADMINISTRATION PERSPECTIVE OF

01:00:42.338 --> 01:00:44.073
IMPLEMENTING THIS IT ADDS A

01:00:44.140 --> 01:00:47.510
COMPLEXITY THERE- SO WE ARE

01:00:47.577 --> 01:00:49.879
TRYING TO. GET THIS ON A FIRST

01:00:49.946 --> 01:00:51.180
COME FIRST SERVE BASIS BECAUSE

01:00:51.247 --> 01:00:52.915
WE'RE THINKING- IT'S MORE

01:00:52.982 --> 01:00:55.351
EQUITABLE OR IT'S AN EQUITABLE

01:00:55.418 --> 01:00:57.186
GOAL TO GET THE FUNDING OUT

01:00:57.253 --> 01:00:59.889
QUICKER. KNOWING THAT IF YOU ARE

01:00:59.956 --> 01:01:03.493
BUSINESS WITH HUNDRED K. ANNUAL

01:01:03.559 --> 01:01:06.062
REVENUE. AND GET THE SCRIPT AT-

01:01:06.129 --> 01:01:07.930
THE DIFFERENCE IN A MONTH OF

01:01:07.997 --> 01:01:10.233
GETTING IT WHICH THIS WHICH TO

01:01:10.299 --> 01:01:12.468
DIFFERENT WAYS OF A- DEFINING

01:01:12.535 --> 01:01:15.204
ELIGIBILITY MIGHT SLOW DOWN-

01:01:15.271 --> 01:01:16.439
FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE THAT'S IT'S

01:01:16.506 --> 01:01:18.374
WORTH THAT. SO WE SHARE THE

01:01:18.441 --> 01:01:20.410
CONCERN ABOUT EQUITY AND THIS IS

01:01:20.476 --> 01:01:22.812
OUR ABILITY TO TRY TO THREAD

01:01:22.879 --> 01:01:24.247
THAT NEEDLE. IT HAS BEEN THE

01:01:24.313 --> 01:01:25.948
EXPERIENCE OF THIS COMMITTEE IN

01:01:26.015 --> 01:01:27.483
THE LAST TWO YEARSAMID COVE IT

01:01:27.550 --> 01:01:28.684
AND CALL IT RECOVERY EFFORTS FOR

01:01:28.751 --> 01:01:30.920
SMALL BUSINESSES THAT. ITS

01:01:30.987 --> 01:01:32.789
MINORITY OWNED BUSINESSES WOMEN

01:01:32.855 --> 01:01:35.525
OWNED BUSINESSES A BUSINESSES

01:01:35.591 --> 01:01:38.628

IS NOT ENGLISH- HAVE HAD. 

01:01:42.465 --> 01:01:45.234
THE BEST RESULTS IN TERMS OF ONE

01:01:45.301 --> 01:01:46.569
RECEIVING FUNDING RECEIVING

01:01:46.636 --> 01:01:48.271
RESOURCES HAVING ACCESS TO

01:01:48.337 --> 01:01:50.573
RESOURCES. SO WHAT IS WHAT IS

01:01:50.640 --> 01:01:53.676
THE- I GUESS OUT REACH APPROACH

01:01:53.743 --> 01:01:56.312

FIRST SERVE BASIS WHERE IT'S

01:02:02.752 --> 01:02:03.386
THOSE THAT ARE MOST SAVVY. THAT

01:02:03.453 --> 01:02:05.721
WILL HAVE ACCESS. FREESHIP THAT

01:02:05.788 --> 01:02:07.623
POINT AS WELL. THE IT AS A

USE. ABSOLUTELY I THANK YOU I'M

01:02:19.368 --> 01:02:22.438
SURE COULD BE- THAT IN-

01:02:22.505 --> 01:02:25.441
RECOGNIZING THE CONCERN FOR OUT

01:02:25.508 --> 01:02:27.343

WE ARE PERFECTING. ARE FROM IT

01:02:36.185 --> 01:02:38.588
STARTED WITH THE COVERED RELIEF

01:02:38.654 --> 01:02:40.423
GRANT- PROGRAM BUT FRANKLY WE

01:02:40.490 --> 01:02:43.059
HAVE MODELED THAT OUTREACH IN

01:02:43.126 --> 01:02:44.694
ALL OF OUR PROGRAMS NOW. AND

01:02:44.760 --> 01:02:46.362
IT'S PRETTY MUCH- STANDARD

01:02:46.429 --> 01:02:48.431
OPERATING PROCEDURE FOR STANDING

01:02:48.498 --> 01:02:50.700
UP A PROGRAM. TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:02:50.766 --> 01:02:53.102

CALIFORNIA HAS THAT EXCEPT THE

01:12:38.787 --> 01:12:40.823

THAT HELPED QUITE A BIT- IN

01:12:49.465 --> 01:12:51.100
RETAINING OUR PEOPLE BUT I THINK

01:12:51.166 --> 01:12:53.202
OVER THE COURSE OF TIME IS AS

01:12:53.268 --> 01:12:54.436

01:13:10.419 --> 01:13:11.019
THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO DO. BUT WE

01:13:11.086 --> 01:13:12.788
FREQUENTLY DEAL WITH PEOPLE ON

01:13:12.855 --> 01:13:14.490
THE WORST DAYS OF THEIR LIVES

01:13:14.556 --> 01:13:16.558
THEY LOST THEIR JOBS. THEY'VE

01:13:16.625 --> 01:13:18.026
