IS THE CONFIRMATION OF A LUXURY- DAYLIGHT CREWS TO THE SEISMIC SAFETY COMMISSION- SHE IS THE DIRECTOR OF SONOMA COUNTY OFFICE OF EQUITY SHE SERVES IN THE SLOT ON THE COMMISSION DESIGNATED FOR A MEMBER WITH A BACKGROUND IN SOCIAL SERVICE. SHE WAS APPROVED IN THE RULES COMMITTEE HEARING ON APRIL SIX I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN IPHONE. CENTER GROVE. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT- I LOVE SITTING ON THE RULES COMMITTEE WITH ALL THE THINGS THAT WE DO ONE OF THE THINGS WE DO IS GOVERNOR'S APPOINTMENTS AND I DO BELIEVE WHOLEHEARTEDLY THAT THE GOVERNOR HAS THE RIGHT TO CHOOSE ANYBODY HE WANTS FOR THE APPOINTMENTS- USALLY WHEN I OPPOSE AN APPOINTMENT I USUALLY ASK THE QUESTIONS THAT I WANT TO ASK. AND I'VE NEVER SPOKEN ADAMANTLY AGAINST AN APPOINTMENT LIKE I'M ABOUT READY TO DO TODAY THIS INDIVIDUAL THAT HAS BEEN APPOINTED TO THE SEISMIC SAFETY COMMITTEE IS A SHEER. ACTIVIST IN BY YOUR OWN ADMISSION SHE IS AN ACTIVIST BY LITIGATION. CALIFORNIA IS A HIGHLY MOST HIGHEST LITIGATED STATE IN THE NATION. AND TO HAVE SOMEONE LIKE THIS IN ANY TYPE OF PUBLIC OFFICE IS TRULY A DISGRACE THE CALIFORNIA. I CAN TELL YOU THAT WHILE SHE WAS AT THE LRB AND DEALER BE HEADED NORTH THE IT IS AN ORGANIZATION THAT STOOD AGAINST FARMWORKERS IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. FOR YEARS EVEN AFTER THEY HAD VOTED SEVERAL TIMES ARE HAD SIGNATURES GATHERED SEVERAL TIMES FOR THEIR VOTE TO BE COUNTED TO DECERTIFY UFW. THE LRB CONTINUED ACTIVIST ACTIVISION ACTIVISTS THROUGH LITIGATION- AGAINST THESE FARMWORKERS. RIGHT NOW I'M ON A IN THE BAY AREA- OR THE NORTH BAY AREA. THIS INDIVIDUAL IS PART OF NORTH BAY JOBS FOR JUSTICE WHERE THIS ORGANIZATION PRETENDS TO PROTECT FARMWORKERS THAT. OUR GREAT GROWERS- REQUIRING THESE THESE GROWERS TO BE ABLE TO PUT ALL OF THEIR SAFETY DOCUMENTS INTO DIALECTS THERE'S OVER THIRTY DIALECTS. IF THIS INDIVIDUAL TOOK THREE MINUTES OUT OF HER TWENTY FOUR HOURS DAY POSITION AND SHE MET WITH THESE FARMWORKERS IN THESE GROWERS THEY WOULD TELL THEM THEY WOULD TELL HER THAT. IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO DO THIS TRANSLATION BECAUSE SOME OF THESE DIALECTS OVER THIRTY OF THEM SOME OF THEM ARE ONLY SPOKE AND NOT WRITTEN. BUYER LIKE I SAID HER OWN ADMISSION SHE'S AN ACTIVIST THROUGH LITIGATION. AND IT'S BE WHO'S ME AND I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THE GOVERNOR WOULD APPOINT SOMEBODY USE TAXPAYER DOLLARS TO PAY THEIR SALARY- WHEN ESPECIALLY IN THE NEW POSITION OF THE SEISMIC SAFETY POSITION THAT SHE'S ABOUT READY TO BE CONFIRMED FOR- WE DON'T NEED ACTIVISTS THROUGH LITIGATION IN SEISMIC SAFETY. WE DON'T NEED OF LAWSUITS FILED AGAINST HOSPITALS PRIVATE BUSINESSES PRIVATE HOMES WE DON'T NEED ANY OF THAT WE NEED TO HAVE. WE NEED. OBVIOUSLY BUILDING TO. I'M SAFE IN AND WITHSTAND EARTHQUAKE BUT THIS ACTIVISTS POSITION THAT'S BEING FILLED TODAY IS COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE AND THIS PERSON SHOULD NEVER HOLD A PLACE IN PUBLIC OFFICE AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A NO VOTE. THANK YOU CINNABAR. THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER PRESIDENT. MEMBERS. I'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT MR THE CRUISE CRUISE FROM SOMEONE WHO'S KNOWN HER FOR LITERALLY YEARS. FIRST AND FOREMOST I THINK WE NEED TO CLARIFY TO THIS BODY. THAT THE SEISMIC SAFETY COMMISSION HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH LITIGATION. NOTHING. MR THE CRUISE IS A DEDICATED PUBLIC SERVANT. HE IS A PROVEN ATTORNEY HE'S A MOTHER IN YES. SHE IS AN ADVOCATE FOR FARMWORKERS. LET ME TELL YOU WHY WORKER FAMILY. WHO STRUGGLED WE STRUGGLED GROWING UP HER PARENTS WERE POOR THEY STRUGGLE TO BE ABLE TO PAY THE RENT. KAMALA PUT FOOD ON THE TABLE. SO WHEN WE ALL SEE STRUGGLE GROWING UP WE WANT TO CHANGE THAT AS AN ADULT SAID THE CHIEF FORMER CHIEF DEPUTY COUNSEL IN THE CINEMA COUNTY COUNTY COUNSEL'S OFFICE. HE'S A SANTA ROSA CITY SCHOOL BOARD MEMBER RIGHT NOW. HE'S THE FIRST DIRECTOR THE FIRST DIRECTOR IN THE COUNTY SONORA TO BE ABLE TO HEAD THE CINEMA COUNTY OFFICE OF EQUITY ENSURING THAT PEOPLE OF COLOR AND WOMEN HAVE A SEAT AT THE TABLE AND BY THE WAY THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD ALL BE CHAMPION. SHE BRINGS AMAZING EXPERIENCE TO BE ABLE TO ESTABLISH EQUITY IN OUR GOVERNMENT HE'S BEN TESTED WITH GASTRIC DISASTER PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE AND RECOVERY WHEN SHE WAS A MEMBER OF THE COUNTY COUNCIL TO REBUILD OUR COMMUNITIES THAT WERE DEVASTATED BY THE TUBBS FIRE. I WANT TO SAY ONE MORE TIME. THIS IS AN INCREDIBLE ONE. SHE'S AN AMAZING LEADER IN OUR COMMUNITY IN THIS STATE WILL BE STRONGER WITH HER SERVING ON THE COMMISSION I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE DISCUSSION AND DEBATE ON THE APPOINTMENT EARNS. CERVIX THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT AND I MUST RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE ON WHETHER THIS DALY CRUISES AND ACTIVISTS TO USE THE HER POSITION ON THE SEISMIC SAFETY COMMISSION- I ASKED HER WHY SHE WOULD WANT TO SEND A BROCHURE TO EVERY RANCHER IN THE STATE AND ASKING THEM. TO GIVING THEM THE DIRECTION OF HOW THEY MIGHT- WEIGH IN ON WHETHER THEY HAVE ANY OF. VIOLATIONS BUILDING INSPECTION PROBLEMS IN THEIR OF RENTAL AND I ASKED HER WHY WOULD SHE WANT TO SEND THAT TO A CODE ENFORCEMENT OFFICER SO HE MIGHT IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT RELATE TO. OF THE RESIDENCE AND CERTAINLY THE BUSINESS OWNERS THAT THEY WERE GOING TO DO CERTAIN KIND OF INSPECTIONS AND SHE THOUGHT IT WAS MORE APPROPRIATE AND MORE IMPACTFUL. ARE THAT IT WENT DIRECTLY TO INDIVIDUALS INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE OF WHETHER THERE IS A VIOLATION- IN THEIR BUILDING- WITH CODE ENFORCEMENT REGULATIONS AND THAT SEEMS TO ME TO BE QUITE WIDE SWEEPING IN TERMS OF ACTIVISM ACTIVIST. ACTIVIST OUT- OPPORTUNITIES TO GET THE RESIDENTS IN OF VARIOUS- RENTAL SITUATIONS ARE CONCERNED IN WORKSHOPS AND SH. WE HAVE A VERY GOOD EXPLANATION TO THAT SO I'M SORRY I WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO SUPPORT HER EITHER BECAUSE I DO BELIEVE THAT SHE SEES HER NEW POSITION AS WELL AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO THE VERY THING BECAUSE- OF. A LEGAL ACTIONS IN AREAS WHERE PEOPLE WILL HAVE TO DEFEND THAT OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WILL BE UNDER OUR THAT KIND OF SURVEILLANCE AND I THINK THAT THAT'S REALLY IN OVERREACH IN TERMS OF THE RESPONSIBILITIES AND AUTHORITIES THAT ARE GIVEN TO PEOPLE WHO SERVE ON THIS BOARD. SO I ORIGINAL VOTE. THANK YOU. ANY FOR THE- DEBATE ON UP ON. IN NINETEEN NINE EARLIER CLOSE. THANK YOU MISTER PER OF WE RAN TO GROUND TO MAKE.

FIFTY YEARS AGO CONGRESS APPROVED THE EQUAL RIGHTS AMENDMENT AND BEGAN THE ERA'S JOURNEY FOR STATE BY STATE RATIFICATION. UNDER OUR CONSTITUTION RICK WE REQUIRE THIRTY EIGHT STATES TO RATIFY FOR AMENDMENTS TO BECOME A PART OF THE CONSTITUTION. WE NOW HAVE THIRTY EIGHT STATES WHO HAVE RATIFIED THE ERA AS THE TWENTY EIGHTH AMENDMENT. IN THE LAST FEW YEARS ILLINOIS NEVADA AND MOST RECENTLY VIRGINIA. BECAME IN VIRGINIA IN TWENTY TWENTY BECAME THE THIRTY EIGHTH AND FINAL STATE ACHIEVING THAT NECESSARY RATIFICATION YES THE FEDERAL ARCHIVIST HAS NOT CERTIFIED RATIFICATION OR PUBLISHED ERA CITING THE ARBITRARY DEADLINE THAT CONGRESS SETS IN. ONE OF ITS BILLS FOR WHEN RATIFICATION NEEDED TO BE DONE NOW IF YOU LOOK AT THE HISTORY OF OUR CONSTITUTION THERE ARE MANY AMENDMENTS THAT TOOK YEARS FOR PASSAGE AND MANY AMENDMENTS THAT HAD NO DEADLINES AND THERE'S NOTHING IN OUR CONSTITUTION THAT STATES EIGHT EIGHT AN AMENDMENT MUST HAVE MUST BE APPROVED WITHIN A CERTAIN TIME PERIOD. AND THE ERA IS NOT THE ONLY AMENDMENT THAT IS NEEDED MANY YEARS FOR RATIFICATION THERE IS ONE THAT IS NOW IN THE CONSTITUTION THAT TOOK TWO HUNDRED YEARS BEFORE IT HAD THE NECESSARY STATES. THE EQUAL RIGHTS AMENDMENT LANGUAGE IS VERY SIMPLE. IT BASICALLY STATES THAT THERE WILL THAT THERE WILL BE NO. LEGAL DISCRIMINATION BASED ON SEX WHICH ADVANCES JUSTICE FOR WOMEN AND GIRLS AND GENDER EXPANSIVE INDIVIDUALS. AND WITH THE AREAS PART OF OUR CONSTITUTION IT WILL ALLOW LAWS THAT PERPETUATE INEQUALITY OR IN EQUITABLE GENDER ROLES TO BE STRUCK DOWN AS UNCONSTITUTIONAL. S. T. A. R. TWELVE URGES CONGRESS TO PASS H. R. EIGHT NINETY ONE AUTHORED BY CALIFORNIA'S OWN CONGRESSWOMAN JACKIE SPEER DECLARING THAT THE ERA HAS MET ITS REQUIREMENTS TO BECOME THE TWENTY EIGHTH AMENDMENT.

THE TWENTY EIGHTH AMENDMENT TO THE SACRED DOCUMENT FIRST RATIFIED IN SEVENTEEN EIGHTY EIGHT YES CALIFORNIANS SOME OTHER STATES HAVE ENSHRINED NON DISCRIMINATION AND EQUAL PROTECTION PROVISIONS INTO OUR CONSTITUTION AND STATE LAWS THERE STILL REMAINS A FUNDAMENTAL NEED TO FINALIZE THIS AMENDMENT INTO THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION. LIKE OTHER QUOTE UNQUOTE FEDERAL RIGHTS INCLUDING THE RIGHT TO PRIVACY PROTECTIONS FOR WOMEN AGAINST DISCRIMINATION. THEY ARE AT BEST IN LEGAL LIMBO AND SUBJECT TO CHANGE DUE TO NEW INTERPRETATIONS OF LEGAL PRECEDENT WOMEN OF COLOR ARE IS. IN JEOPARDY FONG CHRISTMAS THEREFORE MOVES FAST TO APPROVE THIS RESOLUTION AND FORMALIZE THE RATIFICATION OF THE TWENTY EIGHTH AMENDMENT TO THE UNITED STATES BECAUSE- TO HUNDRED AND THIRTY FOUR YEARS IS LONG ENOUGH. FOR THE WOMEN AND THE GIRLS OF OUR COUNTRY TO RECEIVE A FORMAL ASSURANCE BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT THE QUOTE EQUALITY OF RIGHTS UNDER THE LAW SHALL NOT BE DENIED OR ABRIDGED. BY THE UNITED STATES OR BY ANY STATE ON ACCOUNT OF SEX END QUOTE I THANK THE SENATOR FOR BRINGING THIS RESOLUTION UP FOR A VOTE AND I URGE ALL OF MY COLLEAGUES.

TWELVE ON BEHALF OF THIS CHAIR OF THE ASIAN AMERICAN SIKANDAR LEGISLATIVE CAUCUS.

THIS ACT IS ESSENTIAL TO GUARANTEE EQUAL RIGHTS REGARDLESS OF ONE SEX AND FORTUNE WE HAVE SEEN IN THE API COMMUNITY THAT- WOMEN HAVE BEEN PARTICULARLY TARGETED WITH. HATE ACCORDING TO STOP AB I HATE MORE THAN HALF OF THE HEAT INCIDENTS REPORTED SINCE THE START PANDEMIC HAVE BEEN REPORTED BY WOMEN. AND EARLIER THIS YEAR IS THE ONE YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF THE SHOOTING ATLANTA WHERE API WOMEN WERE TARGETED AND KILLED. UNFORTUNATELY WOMEN ARE STILL NOT SEEN AS EQUALS AND PART OF THAT CULTURE STEM FROM ADEQUATE POLICIES THAT PREVIOUSLY ENCOURAGED IT. AND WE STILL OF COURSE HAVE MORE WORK TO DO.

THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT AND THAT'S YOUR LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS I STAND IN SUPPORT OF SJR TWELVE WHICH pTHE TWENTY EIGHTH AMENDMENT OF OUR CONSTITUTION. AS J. R. TWELVE ALSO CALLED ON THE US CONGRESS TO APPROVE HOUSE RESOLUTION EIGHT NINETY ONE AUTHORED BY OUR FORMER MEMBER AND CALIFORNIA'S OWN CONGRESSWOMAN JACKIE SPEER. WOMEN HAVE BEEN GREAT SOURCES OF INSPIRATION AND LEADERSHIP FOR MANY GENERATIONS SINCE. THE ORIGIN OF THIS COUNTRY IS OFTEN STATED IF YOU WANT SOMETHING SAID YOU ASKED THE MAN IF YOU WANT SOMETHING DONE YOU ASKED A WOMAN. IS ALSO SAID IT'S A MAN'S WORLD BUT WE ALL KNOW A WOMAN MEXICO AROUND WOMEN FROM ALL BACKGROUNDS HAVE ONE IMPORTANT ADVANCEMENTS IN THE MOVEMENT THEY'VE HELP SHAPE POLICIES AND SOCIETY AND CULTURE THAT. MORE THAT MOVE OUR STATE BUDGET TODAY AND OUR COUNTRY IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION DESPITE ALL OF THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS MILESTONES IN HISTORICAL POSITIONS WOMEN. HAVE HELD. THERE ARE STILL NOT LEGALLY PROTECTED AGAINST GENDER AND SEX DISCRIMINATION IN UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION. THE EQUAL RIGHTS AMENDMENT WHICH PROVIDES AN IS EXPLICIT CONSTITUTIONAL GUARANTEE OF SEX EQUALITY IS CRITICAL. TO FILLING THE FUNDAMENTAL ASPECTS EXCLUDED FROM THE CONSTITUTION. IN NINETEEN TWENTY ONE ONE YEAR AFTER THE PASSAGE OF THE NINETEENTH AMENDMENT. WOMEN'S RIGHT LEADERS PROPOSED THE FIRST EQUAL RIGHTS AMENDMENT AFTER THE DEMANDS FOR GENDER. REQUIRE EQUALITY RESURFACED B. R. A. WAS SUBSEQUENTLY INTRODUCED IN CONGRESS FOR THE FIRST TIME IN NINETEEN TWENTY THREE AND PASS CONGRESS IN NINETEEN SEVENTY TWO. THIRTY FIVE OF THIRTY EIGHT STATES QUICKLY RATIFIED THE AMENDMENT NEEDED FOR IT TO BECOME PART OF THE CONSTITUTION HOWEVER ON JANUARY. TWENTY SEVEN TWENTY TWENTY TWO VIRGINIA HAS AS A FINAL STATE TO RATIFY THE CEMENT WHAT'S THE FINAL STATE I SHOULD SAY WOMEN AVE AND CONTINUE TO BE A PIVOTAL PART OF OUR SOCIETY WE SHOULD ENSURE THAT ONE OF THE MOST DEVELOPED COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD. THAT THEY HAVE EQUAL CONSTITUTIONAL PROTECTION FROM GENDER AND SEX DISCRIMINATION WOMEN FACE DISCRIMINATION OF UNEQUAL PAY WORKPLACE HARASSMENT PREGNANCY PREGNANCY DISCRIMINATION AND DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ARE HIGHER RATE THAN MEN. PARTICULARLY THOSE WHO ARE FROM HISTORICALLY MORE MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES AS WE LOOK TO RECOVERY. EQUITABLY AS A STATE IN THE NATION WE MUST DO WHATEVER WE CAN TO PROTECT ALL AMERICANS FROM DISCRIMINATION THE EQUAL RIGHTS AMENDMENT PROVIDES A STRONGER CONSTITUTIONAL BASIS FOR COMBATING SEX DISCRIMINATION AND ALLOWS CONGRESS MORE THORNY TO ENACT WALLS. THAT INSURERS SEX EQUALITY CALIFORNIA HAVING LONG BEEN AT THE FOREFRONT WHEN IT COMES TO WOMEN'S RIGHTS AND THAT TRADITION REMAINS TODAY. I MADE NOTE OF SENATORS BEER AUTHORING THIS HOUSE RESOLUTION SENATOR DIANNE FEINSTEIN AS WELL AS SENATOR ALEX PADILLA HAVE JOINED IN THE EFFORTS ADVOCATE FOR THE SAME RESOLUTION IN THE SENATE AS WELL.

CENTER HERTZBERG. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR PRESIDENT SENATORS IN ALL THE COMMUNITIES REPRESENTED ALL TOO FAMILIAR CYCLE OF DROUGHT. NATURE'S CHANGE FASTER THAN ANYONE EXPECTED THE BOTTOM LINE IS WE HAVE LESS WATER TO GO AROUND FOR THE ENVIRONMENT OR THE AGRICULTURAL COMMUNITY AND FOR ALL OF OUR HOMES AND OUR FAMILIES. EVERY DAY WE READ THE NEWS THE HEADLINES ABOUT HOW THE SEVERE HOW DO A SEVERE THE DROUGHT GROSS. LA TIMES HEADLINE. AS DROUGHT HAMMERS MONA LAKE THIRSTY LOS ANGELES MUST LOOK ELSEWHERE FOR WATER HEADLINE. MERCURYNEWS SIERRA SNOWPACK FAILS TO ONE OF FALLS TO ONE OF THE LOWEST LEVELS IN SEVENTY YEARS HEADLINE ABC SEVEN NEWS DATA SHOWS DRIEST JANUARY THROUGH MARCH IN CALIFORNIA HISTORY HEADLINE CNN LAKE POWELL IS ABOUT TO DROP BELOW A CRITICAL LEVEL. NEVER REACHED BEFORE AS DROUGHT RAGES ON. AND THE L. A. TIMES AGAIN WESTERN MEGA DROUGHT IS THE WORST IN TWELVE HUNDRED YEARS. INTENSIFIED BY CLIMATE CHANGE STUDY FINDS. THESE ARE JUST FEW OF THE EXTRAORDINARY HEADLINES AS WE FACE. OUR GOVERNOR RECENTLY SIGNED AN EXECUTIVE ORDER IS ANOTHER STARK WARNING. OF HOW STRESSED OUR WATER SUPPLIES HAVE BECOME AND AT THE WORST OF THE DROUGHT IS YES TO COME. AFTER OUR LAST DROUGHT THAT ENDED A MERE SIX YEARS AGO ASSEMBLY MEMBER FRIEDMAN I PASSED A PACKAGE OF BILLS IN CONJUNCTION WITH GOVERNOR BROWN CHANGING WATER CONSERVATION AS WE KNOW IT. THIS PACKAGE WAS RESULT OF A TWO YEAR EFFORT AMONG US IN BOTH HOUSES IN WHICH WE HELD HEARINGS AND SOLICIT INPUT AND FEEDBACK FROM DOZENS OF ORGANIZATIONS. AT THE OUTCOME OF THESE NEGOTIATIONS WAS TO SET THE EXCUSE ME THE OUTCOME IS NEGOTIATIONS WAS TO SET RESIDENTIAL IN THE RESIDENTIAL USE STANDARDS. AND WE ASKED THE WATER RESOURCES AND STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD TAKE A LOOK AT THOSE STANDARDS AND THE CURRENT USAGE AND COME BACK TO US WITH RECOMMENDATIONS FOR UPDATING THOSE STANDARDS. AS THAT MEASURES AND THAT MEASURE IS WHAT IS BEFORE US HERE TODAY ON THIS FLOOR. WE'RE UPDATING THE STANDARDS BASED UPON THE BEST AVAILABLE DATA CURRENT USAGE AND BEST PRACTICES. CALIFORNIA HAS ALWAYS BEEN MEMBERS ON THE FOREFRONT OF EFFICIENCY. BUT WE ALWAYS TOLD THAT IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO ACHIEVE UNTIL WE ACTUALLY DO IT. JUST LOOK AT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND HOW WE SET STANDARDS TAILPIPE EMISSIONS I'LL NEVER FORGET WHEN SOMEONE CENTER PAVLEY THEN ASSEMBLY MILLIMAN PAVLEY TALK ABOUT TAILPIPE EMISSIONS IMPOSSIBLE WHEN GOVERNOR BROWN IN THE FIRST TERM TALKED ABOUT. THE END OF. AND WE'RE GONNA SETS ARE USUALLY TROUBLE IMPOSSIBLE NOW THE WHOLE COUNTRY REALIZING THAT THE R. P. S. STANDARD IMPOSSIBLE NOW WHAT'S HAPPENING AND EVEN UNDER PRESIDENT NIXON UNDER THE CLEAN AIR ACT IMPOSSIBLE WHEN I WAS GROWING UP IN LOS ANGELES AND WE HAD TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY TWO DAYS. OF SMOG THAT ALERTS AND NOW THERE'S BEEN NONE. IMPOSSIBLE WE HAVE TO ENGAGE. NOW THERE'S SOME ARGUMENTS THAT SAY THAT YOU CAN ONLY FLUSH THE TOILET ONCE TODAY UNDER THESE STANDARDS. ARE AND TAKE A SHOWER EVERY OTHER DAY BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT THIS BILL DOES IT IS NOT FACTUAL IT IS GREAT FODDER FOR TWITTER IN THIS SOCIAL MEDIA WAR. UNFORTUNATELY IT'S NOT THE TRUTH. WE BUILT IN FLEXIBILITY IN THE ORIGINAL PACKAGE THE INDOOR EFFICIENCY STANDARDS THE SUBJECT OF THIS MEASURE. ARE JUST ONE PART OF A TOTAL FORMULA TO DETERMINE HOW WATER USAGE MUST BE MADE. BETTER OVERALL WATER JUICE OF THE ISSUE ON A SYSTEM WIDE BASIS WE'VE ALREADY SEEN SUCCESS OF OUR EFFORTS. WHICH IS PROOF THAT THE WATER USAGE HAS BEEN ON A STEADY DECLINE THE CURRENT MEDIUM WATER USAGES FORTY EIGHT GALLONS PER CAPITA DAILY. AND THAT IS WELL BELOW THE TWENTY TWENTY STANDARD WHICH IS CURRENTLY IN STATUTE. SOME SAY THIS IS GOING TO BE COSTLY IS GOING TO COST THE TOP. WELL THAT'S- LET ME. THAT THERE'S NOTHING LESS. THAN CONSERVATION THE SAME ARGUMENTS ARE MET TIME AND TIME AND TIME AGAIN WHAT DO YOU DO WHEN YOU RUN OUT OF WATERWHAT'S THE COST WHEN YOU RUN INTO WATER TO SOCIETY TO EVERY OTHER ASPECT OF OUR LIFE. WE HAVE TO SET THE STANDARDS TOO CAN. TO CONSERVE GOING FORWARD INTO THE FUTURE. AND IF THE STATE DOESN'T SET THOSE STANDARDS. AND WE DON'T DETERMINE WHAT CONSERVATION OFFICIALS SHE MEANS AS I SUGGEST WE WILL BE EVEN BIGGER TROUBLE BECAUSE CLIMATE CHANGE HAS THROWN ALL OF THE RULES OUT OF THE WINDOW. I ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT OF THIS VERY IMPORTANT MEASURE. THANK YOU ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION AND DEBATE SENATOR DALLAS. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT MEMBERS I RISE TODAY TO JUST PUT OUT SOME FACTS. TWO THOUSAND AND SEVENTEEN THE LAST TWO MONTHS OF TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN AND THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN. WHERE THE WETTEST. PERIOD OF TIME IN THE HISTORY OF OUR STATE. SINCE WE'VE BEEN KEEPING RECORDS. THE OROVILLE DAM SPILLWAY BROKE YOU'LL RECALL THAT THAT WAS THE WETTEST TIME OF THE YEAR NOW LOOK THIS DEBATE IS NOT ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE THIS IS ABOUT WHAT WE COULD DO. IN CLIMATE CHANGE AND HOW AREWE GOING TO. TAKE CARE OF CALIFORNIANS. THIS STATE HAS NOT BUILT ANY NEW WATER STORAGE SINCE THE SIXTIES NINETEEN SIXTY FIVE OR BILL THEM WANT TO PUT. DAMS ON RIVERS AND THAT'S FINE WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD SITES RESERVOIR WHICH WAS ALLOCATED IN THE PROP ONE BONDS BUT IT'S NOT BEEN BUILT AND WE HAVE LITERALLY MILLIONS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN OUR BUDGET RIGHT NOW WE SHOULD BE BUILDING. THE OFF SITE THE SITES RESERVOIR OFF STREAM STORAGE PROJECT WHICH BENEFITS. FISH AND THE HABITAT IF IT IF IT'S FARMS IT BIT FITS UNIT MUNICIPALITIES AND QUITE FRANKLY WILL REORGANIZE THE DELTA SO WE CAN USE THE WATER MORE EFFICIENTLY. WE TALK ABOUT CONCERT CONCERT CONSERVATION. YOU CAN ONLY CONSERVE SO MUCH WATER. WE HAVE DOUBLE THE POPULATION OF CALIFORNIA AND WE NEED TO BUILD MORE STORAGE AND THE BIGGEST RESERVOIR IN THE STATE IS NOT. SHASTA OR OR OR BILL OR MORE FULSOME DAMS THE BIGGEST RESERVOIR IS THE SIERRAS. WHERE THE ABOVE THOSE DAMS ARE THE WATERSHEDS THAT FEED THOSE LEGS AND FEET ARE RIVERS. LAST YEAR THE DIXIE FIRE THE LARGEST FIRE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. BURNED ALMOST A MILLION ACRES THAT'S THE WATERSHED THAT FEEDS OR BILL. WE NEEDED A GOOD CONSERVATION IN OUR FOREST WE NEED TO BE THINNING ARE FORCED TO THE FIRE CAN GO THROUGH AND ALLOW THAT WATER TO BE CAPTURED AND STORED IN OUR IN OUR MEADOWS AND COME OUT INTO OUR STREAMS LATER AT A LATER TIME OF THE YEAR SO I JUST WANT TO SHARE THAT YOU KNOW WE TALK ABOUT COMMERCE CONSERVATION IN THIS. IN THIS LEGISLATURE EVERY DAY BUT WE DON'T TALK ABOUT CREATING NEW WATER AND MORE WATER. YOU CAN ONLY CONSERVE SO MUCH. WE WENT FROM WHATEVER IT WAS SIXTY GALLONS A DAY TO FORTY EIGHT. THE NEXT MOVE WILL BE. THIRTY FIVE BUT AT SOME POINT YOU HAVE TO CREATE NEW WATER THE POPULATION IS GROWING IN CALIFORNIA. AND WE NEED TO BUILD MORE RESERVOIRS AND BE SMART WITH OUR ENVIRONMENT. DURING CLIMATE CHANGE. THOSE REASON I ASKED FOR A NO VOTE ON THIS BILL WE NEED TO BE BUILDING STORAGE. THANK YOU SENATOR NELSON. MR PRESIDENT LADIES AND GENTLEMEN THE SENATE A YES VOTE CONTINENTS'S AND CONTINUES TO PROMOTE FAILED POLICIES OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. FAILED POLICIES ON WATER WHAT DO I MEAN. FOR THESE DECADES OUR WHOLE WATER POLICIES BEEN PREDICATED ON THE SHARING OF THE SCARCITY LIKEWISE HAS OUR ENERGY POLICIES SHARING OF SCARCITY. THAT'S NOT GOING TO GET US INTO THE FUTURE FOR OUR CHILDREN AND OUR GRANDCHILDREN. YOU ARE BE QUIZZING THEM MORE DROUGHT BECAUSE YOU ARE RELYING ON CONSERVATION FOR EVERYTHING. AGAIN WE HAVE NOT BUILT NEW STORAGE CAPACITY. BUT TEN YEARS AGO THIS LEGISLATURE DID PASS PROPOSITION ONE AND THE VOTERS OVERWHELMINGLY PASSED PROPOSITION ONE. WHAT WAS IN THE PARK AND PROPOSITION ONE. TWO POINT SEVEN FIVE BILLION DOLLARS FOR A NEW LARGE SURFACE STORAGE SEVERE DROUGHT NOT ONE SHOVEL HAS BEEN TURNED. WHY THE ADMINISTRATION'S PEARL. THERE AGENCIES. AND I GUESS THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA HAVEN'T COMPLAINED ABOUT. AND THE REGULATORY AGENCIES OF THE STATE AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAVE BILL LABOR THE PROCESS. SO WE TEN YEARS LATER HAVE NOT STORED A GALLON OF WATER. INSIGHT'S RESERVOIR WHICH WAS THE CHOSEN RESERVOIR FOR THAT FUNDING THERE WERE OTHER. DID UP EXPENDITURES BUT THAT'S THE MAIN ONE. NOW THE WATER COMMISSION JUST PUT IN A MEASLY BILLION OR SO DOLLARS GOOD FOR THEM. BUT THIS IS BEEN AROUND FOR TEN YEARS. AND FOR TEN YEARS ACTUALLY FOR LONGER THAN THAT. THE FIFTY SOME YEARS WE'VE SHARED SCARCITY OR THAT GET. DID THAT HELP YOUR CONSTITUENTS KNOW THEY ARE NOW BEING ASKED TO TIGHTEN. THE FAUCETS EVEN MORE SO TWO OR THREE OR FOUR OR FIVE YEARS FROM NOW WE'LL HAVE ANOTHER DROUGHT. YES WE WILL LIVE FARM TO FIVE OF THE NIGHTLIFE. WE'LL HAVE ANOTHER DROUGHT. SO WHAT ARE WE GONNA CALL GOING TO CONSERVE MORE WATER ARE GOING TO STORE MORE WATER EXCESS WATER THAT COMES DOWN FROM THIS YEAR'S. NO NO WE'RE GONNA CONSERVE BECAUSE THAT'S A BOLD THING TO DO THAT'S THE ONE THING TO DO THAT'S A GOOD THING TO DO. WELL FOLKS IT HASN'T WORKED. LET'S ADMIT THAT. LET'S MOVE ON AND PUT YOUR PRESSURE. ON THE AGENCIES OF GOVERNMENT. TO PERMIT THE BUILDING OF A RESERVOIR IN COLUSA COUNTY. NOW. WHAT DID THIS LEGISLATURE RECENTLY DO THE OPPOSITE I HAD A SIMPLE BILL. SIMPLY IS TRYING TO INCREASE. THE OPPORTUNITY FOR LARGE SURFACE STORAGE TO ENCOURAGE MOVING FORWARD WITH SITES RESERVOIR THE VERY FIRST COMMITTEE IN THIS HOUSE KILL THE BILL. HOLDEN SAID. NO TO STORAGE AND THOSE NO VOTES SAID THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA TIGHTEN YOUR FAUCETS MORE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA WE DON'T CARE ABOUT YOU. THAT'S WHAT THAT MEANT. NOW SOME OF US AND THOSE WHO ARE SPEAKING LOUDER HERE TODAY ARE THOSE WHO REPRESENT THE AREAS WHERE THE WATER COMES FROM. AND WHAT IS HAPPENED IN THOSE AREAS WELL. FOR DECADES OUR POLICIES IN FORCE AND WILDLANDS IS TO LOCK THEM UP DON'T DO ANYTHING WITH THEM. RESULT CATACLYSMIC FIRES THE NOW MOVED INTO THE BIG CITIES- BOARD NOW WE WAKE UP NOW WE'VE GOT A PROBLEM. NOW WE'RE GONNA PUT A LITTLE BIT OF MONEY INTO FOREST AND WILDLAND MANAGEMENT. WELL I SUBMIT I TOOK SOME OF US. NOT TO PARADISE IF YOU YEARS AGO TO SEE THE RAVAGES OF THE FIRE. WELL THE FIRES HAVE A IMPACTED SOME DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT. WE'RE DRIVING ALONG THE BUS. AND LOOKED OUT THE WINDOW AND THERE WAS A LARGE. WHILE THE BOARD. THERE BARBECUED NOT ON THE SPIRIT. BUT IN A FIRE. WHAT IS THE POINT WHERE THESE FIRES DUE TO THE WILDLIFE. DESTROYS BOB ASKED SOME FOLKS DELIVER SEEN A SQUIRREL EXPLODE. I HAVE THAT'S THE REALITY THE WILDLIFE GO UP IN FLAMES AS DOES THEIR HABITAT. THAT HABITAT ALSO HAS A GREAT IMPACT ON THE WATERSHED IN THE STORAGE CAPACITY OF THOSE WATERSHEDS. AND THE ABILITY TO UTILIZE THE EXCESS WATER. IF WE HAD SOME STORAGE CAPACITY. THE LADIES AND GENTLEMAN VOTE NO ON THE PAST FAILED POLICIES. AND LET'S SEND A SIGNAL. THAT WE NEED TO FOCUS ON STORAGE CAPACITY AND MANAGING OUR FORESTS AND WILDLANDS FOR THE SAKE OF COURSE THE FIRES AND THE DISASTERS THEY BEQUEATH. END THE RAVAGES OF NOT BEING ABLE TO HAVE SUFFICIENT WATER. AND WHEN YOU VOTE. THANK ABOUT YOUR GRANDCHILDREN. ONE LAST EXAMPLE. TEN YEARS AGO WERE NEGOTIATING AND GOVERNOR SCHWARZENEGGER'S OFFICE AT TWO O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING. ON PROP ONE. AND I'M LISTENING TO THE MEMBERSHIP THERE SITTING AND TALKING. TALKING ABOUT THEMSELVES TALKING ABOUT THE NEXT ELECTION. AND THE IMPACT THAT THIS MEASURE MIGHT HAVE IN THE NEXT ELECTION. THEN AFTER BEING FRUSTRATED TWO O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING LISTENING TO THIS BLADDER. I SAID DON'T YOU GET IT. THIS IS NOT ABOUT YOU THIS IS NOT ABOUT NOW. THIS IS ABOUT YOUR GRAND CHILDREN. THEN I LOOKED AROUND THAT WHOLE TABLE. INCLUDING A GOVERNOR AND THE BLACK CLUTCH TOLD MEALL I NEEDED TO KNOW THAT WAS NOT ON THEIR MINDS. THANK YOU HAVE A BOOK YES. YOUR GRANDCHILDREN ARE NOT ON YOUR MINDS I URGE A NOBLE NOT EASY FOLLOWING THE CENTER FOR FROM TAMAR. ON THIS TOPIC. I THINK SOME FOLKS THAT- THE MAYBE REPRESENT AREAS THAT DO NOT HAVE AGRICULTURE OR DID NOT HAVE WILDFIRES OR OTHER DIRECT IMPACTS- PERHAPS HAVE SRATCHED THEIR HEADS ON WHY THIS- IGNITES THE IRE OF FOLKS FROM- THE INTERIOR OF CALIFORNIA SPECIAL. FOLKS I THINK WE HAVE A CREDIBILITY PROBLEM IN THIS CHAMBER IN FACT IN THIS BUILDING FOR THINGS. AND THEN NOT DOING. WE HAVE A HISTORY OF PUTTING THINGS OUT TO THE VOTERS. GENERATING THE PR IN THE MACHINERY THAT WILL ALLOW THINGS TO PASS AND THEN DELIBERATELY USING THE INSTRUMENTS OF STATE. DO NOT ALLOW THE WILL OF THE VOTERS TO BE AFFECTED. IN TWENTY FOURTEEN PROP ONE WAS PASSED. HOW LONG HAS IT BEEN SINCE THEN THE GOAL POSTS HAVE BEEN MOVED BY THE RELEVANT STATE AGENCIES ON WHETHER OR NOT ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS OF TODAY ARE EXACTLY LIKE THOSE BACK IN THE DAY WHEN THAT THE MATTER WAS FIRST REVIEWED SO IN SHORT THE INSTRUMENTS AND DIVISIONS IN IN ORGANIZATIONS OF THE STATE HAVE FOUND WAYS TO OBFUSCATE THE WILL OF THE VOTERS. THIS IS A CREDIBILITY PROBLEM WHEN LEGISLATURES LIKE US. BANCED A BILL IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF CALIFORNIANS PROBABLY KNOWING THERE WILL NEVER BE AN AFFECTION WE XIN OF THAT OUTCOME. THIS IS DISHEARTENING IN THE GIVES US A CREDIBILITY PROBLEM. NOW WE HEARD FROM THE AUTHOR OF THIS OF THIS BILL CONSERVATION IS ESSENTIAL AND I WOULD I WOULD VENTURE TO SAY CONSERVATION IS DEFINITELY PART OF PART OF THE- PART THE CALCULUS HERE. WE ALSO HEARD THAT THE AVERAGE USAGES FORTY EIGHT GALLONS PER PERSON PER DAY. WHICH IS BASICALLY IN LINE WITH WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT WITH THIS NEW PROPOSAL RIGHT NOW. SO I DON'T KNOW TO WHAT TO WHAT EFFECT THIS WILL ACTUALLY YIELD. BUT I WOULD CAUTION THE AUTHOR IN IN SUPPORTERS THEY'RE GOING TO TRY PROBABLY IN THE CLOSING STATEMENTS TO DISTINGUISH. CONSERVATION FROM INFRASTRUCTURE BUILD OUT. THEY ARE TWO SIDES OF THE SAME COIN YOU CAN'T CONSERVE OUR WAY OUT UNLESS YOU BUILT. IN CONCERT. CENTER NIELSEN IT'S TO BE THE CENTER FROM TO HIM AND I HAD A BILL IT WAS SHOT DOWN THE FIRST COMMITTEE AND IT WAS SIMPLY TO GET A FACT TO MONEY THAT'S ALREADY BEEN APPROPRIATED BY THE VOTERS TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT SITES RESERVOIR MOVES FORWARD AS WELL AS CONVENIENCE AND OTHER INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS THAT WE HAVE IN OUR VALLEY. HOW INTELLECTUALLY DISHONEST CAN WE BE TO VOTE DOWN TO SOMETHING THE VOTERS APPROVED. THIS IS THE EPITOME OF HYPOCRISY. AND WE DO OR WE DO OUR BEST TO BUILD COLLEGIALITY IN THIS IN THIS IN THIS BUILDING TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT OUR WORD MEANS SOMETHING. BUT MY CONCERN. AND IT'S NOT THIS BILL IT IS THE TOPIC OF WATER IN BILL THE LACK OF COMMITMENT TO EFFECTUATE THE WILL OF THE VOTERS IN THE NEEDS OF OUR STATE FOR TODAY AND TOMORROW. THAT WHEN WE ALLOW ME ALLOW THIS TO HAPPEN AND WE SEGREGATE AND WE COMPARTMENTALIZE AND WE SEPARATE. WHAT IS ESSENTIALLY A DYNAMIC ISSUE REQUIRING A MULTISECTOR APPROACH THAT WE'RE NOT BEING HONEST WE ONLY TAKE A SLIVER HERE AND PUT IT IN THE REALM OF CONSERVATION. COLLEAGUES I IMPLORE YOU. THIS IS NOT A NORMAL BILL THIS IS NOT A NORMAL TOPIC. I'M AFRAID THAT WE'RE GOING TO END THIS LEGISLATIVE YEAR AND MAYBE THE ONES FOLLOWING WITHOUT DOING THE HARD WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE SPECIAL INTERESTS- OF REDOUBLE LECTION OUTCOMES FEAR OF THE POLITICAL FORCES THAT MAY OR MAY NOT EXIST THAT BEAR ON POLITICAL FORTUNES. BUT WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING AND WE SAID WE'RE GOING TO DO IT BUT WHERE IS IT WE HAVEN'T BUILT ANYTHING YET WE HAVEN'T INVESTED IN CONVEYANCE OF THE CANAL SYSTEM WERE DEALT WITH THE SUBSIDENCE ISSUES. COLLEAGUES AND I'LL CONCLUDE HERE. THIS IS A CONSERVATION ISSUE AND WE'RE GOING TO HEAR FROM THE AUTHORING CLOSING DON'T CONFLATE. BUT FRANKLY IT NEEDS TO BE A PART OF THE DISCUSSION. AND I WOULD ASK YOU TO PUSH THIS OFF AS AN ISSUE EVEN VOTE NO TODAY AS AN ISSUE. TO FORCE US TO TAKE THE NEXT STEPS TO DEAL WITH THIS WATER ISSUE THAT INCLUDES STORAGE CONVEYANCING ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS AS WELL AS CONSERVATION. THANK YOU SENATOR MATT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I ANT TO COMMEND MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN FERNANDO VALLEY FOR PUTTING FOR THIS BILL- WE ARE FACING A CLIMATE CRISIS WE OBVIOUSLY HAVE TO ADAPT TO THE CHANGES THAT WE KNOW ARE HERE AND ONE OF THOSE CHANGES UNFORTUNATELY IS THE CYCLE OF DROUGHT THAT WE'RE FACING RIGHT NOW I DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THE COST OF THIS THE PACE OF THIS- I'VE HEARD FROM A NUMBER OF MY LOCAL WATER DISTRICTS- BUT I KNOW THAT MY VALLEY- IS COMMITTED TO MAKING THIS BILL RIGHT TO ADDRESSING SOME OF THE CONCERNS RAISED BY OPPOSITION SO- WITH THAT IN MIND WITH KNOWING HIS HISTORY OF. OF HARD WORK OF WORKING WITH OPPOSITION OF WORKING TO MAKE HIS BILLS RIGHT I AM TO SUPPORT THIS BILL DATES ARE THANK YOU. THANK YOUS. SENATOR OFF. THANK YOU- MISTER PRESIDENT I WANT TO BE SURE TO MAKE SURE. MY VIEWS KNOWN AND I WANT TO. STAND ON THE RECORD IS OF CERTAINLY SUPPORTING CONSERVATION. BUT I ALSO SHARE THE CONCERNS EXPRESSED BY MY COLLEAGUES FROM NORTHERN CALIFORNIA AND FROM THE CENTRAL VALLEY. WE ABSOLUTELY NEED TO SECURE MORE. WATER RESOURCES WHATEVER THOSE ARE AND WE WERE FRANKLY NEED TO DO THEM NOW. I DON'T SIT ON THE COMMITTEES IN THIS HOUSE THEN HERE THOSE SORTS OF MEASURES. BUT I CERTAINLY SUPPORT THE EFFORTS TO EXPLORE WHY ADDITIONAL WATER RESOURCES HAVE NOT BEEN SECURED AND TO PUSH FOR THOSE FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO DO SIT ON THOSE COMMITTEES. I DON'T THINK THESE ISSUES ARE MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE- AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE EVERYBODY KNOWS MY VIEW ON THAT I'M I'M SURE THAT THOSE FROM NORTHERN CALIFORNIA THE CENTRAL VALLEY. I HOPE SHARE THOSE VIEWS SO WE SHOULD DO EVERYTHING THAT WE CAN DO IN THIS HOUSE TO PUSH FOR ENVIRONMENTALLY SENSITIVE ADDITIONAL WATER RESOURCES IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF THOSE RESOURCES IN THE STATE AND WE SHOULD DO SO NOW. BUT AS I SAID THE ISSUES ARE NOT. MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE WE DO NOT HAVE A WATER STORAGE BILL BEFORE US TODAY. SO WITH REGARD TO THIS BILL I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT I KNOW TO CONCERNS EXPRESSED BY THE WATER DISTRICTS IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. AND IN PARTICULAR THOSE. THAT SIT IN THE THIRTY FIRST SENATE DISTRICT- I TRUSTED MY COLLEAGUE FROM. THE SAN FERNANDO VALLEY WILL TAKE THOSE CONCERNS. AND KEEP THEM IN MIND SHOULD THIS BILL PASS OFF THE FLOOR TODAY AND AS IT MOVES THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE. AND TRY AND ADDRESS THE CONCERNS ABOUT THE IMPACT ON THE WATER INFRASTRUCTURE IN REDUCTION. IN WATER USE NO QUESTION WE NEED TO REDUCE THE WATER USE BUT WE ALSO NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE- TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE IMPACT ON OUR LOCAL WATER DISTRICTS. HOW THEY'RE GOING TO FUND THE CHANGES IN THEIR OPERATIONS THAT ARE NECESSARY AND OCCASIONED BY. THE WATER OR THE REDUCTION IN WATER USE THE BADLY NEEDED WATER PRODUCTION WATER USE IN THIS STATE. BUT NEVERTHELESS IT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED SO I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PATIENCE. THANK YOU SENATOR STERN. THANK YOU COLLEAGUES I WONDER RISE AS THE CHAIR THE WATER COMMITTEE- WITH GREAT RESPECT FOR THE CHAIR EMERITUS OF THE WATER COMMITTEE MY COLLEAGUE FROM THE SAN FERNANDO VALLEY. AND JUST GET SOME FACTS STRAIGHT HERE ABOUT WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IF WE'RE- MAKING PRESUMPTIONS ABOUT CREDIBILITY- WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE FUTURE AS SOME FORM OF NOSTALGIA THAT SUDDENLY CALIFORNIANS GOING TO LOOK LIKE IT USED TO. IN THE NEXT TEN AND TWENTY YEARS WE'RE LIVING IN A FANTASY WORLD. THE THOUGHT THAT THE RAINS WILL JUST COME BACK FOR BECAUSE IT WAS A AWAY YEAR LAST YEAR ALSO MEANS THAT THE DROUGHT ISN'T HAMMERING OUR COMMUNITIES. IS SO AT ODDS WITH WHAT'S HAPPENING IT IS GOING TO BE WIDER THAN FLOOD MORE. AND WE'RE IS GOING TO BE DRIER AND WE'RE GONNA HAVE MORE SEVERE DROUGHTS THOSE TWO IN THIS CLIMATE ERA THAT GREAT SNAPBACK OUR EYES AND SO I JUST I'M SO INCREDULOUS BECAUSE WHEN WE AS URBAN WATER USERS GO TO TIGHTEN OUR BELTS AND I THINK THIS IS AN ENORMOUS ACT OF SELF SACRIFICE FOR THE HEART OF URBAN WATER USE. IN THE SAN FERNANDO VALLEY TO BE STEPPING AND SAY WE'RE GONNA DO OUR PART. WE WANT TO PUT OUR EFFICIENCY ON THE TABLE AND SAY WILL STEP UP. AND THOSE WHO WANT SUPPLY ELSEWHERE SAYING. WELL WHY WOULD YOU TIGHTEN YOUR BELTS. THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE BECAUSE WE'RE NOT BUILDING A DAM SOMEWHERE ELSE THAT'S NOT EVEN SHOVEL READY. BUT WE'VE GOT TO BE A LITTLE MORE SOBER ABOUT HOW WE APPROACH THE WATER CONVERSATION THIS ISN'T A PLACE FOR POSTURE THIS IS A LACE FOR DELIVERING. THE SENATE DELIVERED LAST YEAR IN ITS BUDGET ON ITS DROUGHT PACKAGE AND WE'RE GONNA BE DOUBLING DOWN ON THAT I GUARANTEE YOU IT'S HAPPENING THIS YEAR I HAVE. UTTER CONFIDENCE IN MY COLLEAGUES TO GET. THIS WORK DONE BUT I WOULD CAUTION AGAINST ANY SOFTENING HERE. YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND IS CHAIR OF THE COMMITTEE WE STRUGGLE BECAUSE THIS BILL IS ACTUALLY A COMPROMISE. THIS BILL WALKS BACK WHAT WHAT LEGISLATION LAST YEAR WOULD HAVE DONE IN RATCHETING DOWN THE EFFICIENCY STANDARDS IN URBAN USE. TO FORTY EIGHT GALLONS PER DAY. THIS IS ONLY FIFTY FIVE GALLONS PER DAY WHAT CURRENT LOSSES UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. WE'RE NOT ASKING ANYONE TO DO THIS WORK RIGHT NOW BUT IF WE CAN'T SOLVE OVER OUR WAY THROUGH SOME ADDITIONAL SEWER GAS THAT GETS BUILT UP BECAUSE WE'RE BEING MORE EFFICIENT OR THE INFRASTRUCTURE UPGRADES WE NEED BECAUSE- MAYBE YOU'RE NOT. PUSHING AS MUCH OUT OF YOUR SHOWERS. OR YOUR HOUSES THROUGH URBAN WATER USE AND IT'S NOT GOING TO THE WASTE WATER TREATMENT PLANT. THERE ARE THINGS THAT CAN BE SOLVED HERE WE CAN ENGINEER OUR WAY THROUGH THIS BUT- IF WE DON'T EVEN HAVE SPACE TO HOLD OURSELVES ACCOUNTABLE IN THE URBAN AREAS OF. OF CALIFORNIA. I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW WE CAN MOVE FORWARD HERE SO. I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR RUBIO. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR IN AND I ALSO RESPECT THE INTENT OF THE BILL AND TREMENDOUS RESPECT FOR THE AUTHOR BY IN EVERY HEADLINE THAT HE I HAVE READ ON. IS VERY CONCERNING VERY REAL AND I KNOW THAT- WE DEFINITELY HAVE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT. THE CRISIS I ESPECIALLY AS IT PERTAINS TO WATER CONSERVATION AND SETTING NEW STANDARDS ARE CRITICAL. HOWEVER FOR ME IT'S A LITTLE. DIFFERENT AND I UNDERSTAND THAT IN ORDER TO GET THIS DONE WE HAVE TO. INVOLVE OUR LOCAL WATER AGENCIES SO THAT'S WHERE MY CONCERN LIES THAT WE'RE PUTTING A TREMENDOUS BURDEN. FINANCIAL BURDEN ON THESE LOCAL AGENCIES AND IT'S NOT ABOUT GIVING ANYONE A PASS BUT IT'S ABOUT GIVING THEM TIME AND ALLOWING THEM TO COME TO THE TABLE AND- AND RIGHT NOW I JUST DON'T SEE THE ODDS ARE I WANT TO RECONSIDER THE BILL LATER ON AS THE CONVERSATIONS MOVE BUT- YOU KNOW I UNDERSTAND AT A LOCAL LEVEL HOW. MUCH THIS IS GOING TO PUT ON THEM AND SO AGAIN I WANT TO BE SUPPORTIVE IN THE FUTURE WHEN THESE CONVERSATIONS CONTAIN. THIS POINT I WILL HAVE TO LAY OFF YEAH- THANK YOU. ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION INNOVATION- DOT. A YES MISTER- THIS PRESENT I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK I KNOW WERE TRYING TO MOVE ON HERE I'M JUST GONNA SO SAVE MY COMMENTS WITH US SENATOR ROTH BUT I WOULD LIKE TO POINT OUT- TO THE- THE DEAN OF THE SENATE FROM- HEY MATT THANK YOU. YOU KNOW YOU SAY A MEASLY BILLION DOLLARS WAS ALLOCATED SITES RESERVOIR I'M AS FRUSTRATED AS ANYBODY IN THIS ROOM THAT SITES RESERVOIR IS NOT ALREADY BUILT. YOUR FRANKLY I THINK THAT'S GOING TO BE WHAT IS GOING TO BE BUILT BECAUSE THERE IS A BILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT. THE BUILD AND YOU HAVE THE PROPOSITION WHEN IT WAS PASSED WAS SET UP TO SET UP THIS COMMISSION THAT IT WOULD DO IT TWO DIFFERENT ADMINISTRATIONS HAVE BEEN SUPPORTING THAT IT'S WHERE WE ARE NOW AND I WOULD SAY. THAT WE ARE GOING FOR I REALLY DO BELIEVE THEY'RE NOT GOING TO VAST ABILITY AND DOLLARS INSIGHTS RESERVOIR ONLY TO BLOW THAT AND NOT HAVE IT HAPPEN I THINK IT'S ON ITS WAY. BUT AT THE SAME TIME WE CAN WALK. TALK INTO GO AND DO THINGS- ON THE OTHER SIDE CONSERVATION WISE AND SO I ASKED TO SUPPORT THIS BILL. THANK YOU SENATOR CALM WATER. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT YOU KNOW- I DON'T BELIEVE IN EXPLODING SQUIRRELS BUT WHAT I DO BELIEVE IN IS THAT WE HAVE A FINITE NATURAL RESOURCE AND WATER AND A PLANET THAT IS ASKING US TO LIVE IN REALITY ABOUT WHAT IS AT STAKE. SO MY DISTRICT IS NOT AN AGRICULTURAL DISTRICT AND I ACTUALLY WASN'T PLANNING TO SPEAK ON THIS BILL. BUT WE DO USE WATER IN THE THIRTY S. SENATE DISTRICT AND AS A STATE WE NEED TO GET SERIOUS ABOUT WATER USAGE CONSERVATION. RECLAMATION AND HOW TO HELP US MANAGE THIS DWINDLING RESOURCE. YOU CAN'T CONSERVE UNLESS YOU'RE ALSO TALKING ABOUT MANAGING CONSUMPTION THAT'S JUST A REALITY. WE NEED A STATE WIDE CAPITAL INFRASTRUCTURE STRATEGY THAT DOES INCLUDE WATER. WE REALLY DO BECAUSE HOW WE USE IT VARIES FROM THE TIP OF THE STATE TO THE BOTTOM. BUT UNTIL WE GET THERE THIS REALLY IS A RATIONAL AND MEASURED BILL THAT WILL HOPEFULLY JUMPSTART THE KINDS OF ROBUST AND IMMEDIATE AND DIRE DISCUSSIONS THAT WE NEED TO HAVE ABOUT WATER IN OUR LIFE IN CALIFORNIA. I RESPECTFULLY ASK THAT YOU SUPPORT AND VOTE I FOR SB ELEVEN FIFTY SEVEN THANK YOU SENATOR CAFIERO. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT I TO DO- DIDN'T INTEND TO STAND UP AND TALK TODAY BUT- MOSTLY BECAUSE I WASN'T IN SUPPORT HI FRANKLY BUT- I AM. AND I WANT TO TELL YOU WHY SO THAT- HOPEFULLY WE CAN WORK ON THE BIGGER PICTURE I GOTTA TELL YOU I AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUES FROM NORTHERN CALIFORNIA ESPECIALLY WHAT- ARE CALLING FROM- BIEBER SAID. IT IS IT'S FRUSTRATING TO SEE THAT WE DON'T HAVE A COMPREHENSIVE PLAN THAT PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO CONSERVE ON ONE HAND BUT THEN ALSO TO TAKE CARE OF SOME OF THE OTHER ISSUES THAT WILL ENSURE THAT WE HAVE WATER. AND THAT THAT OUR STATE CAN DROUGHT PROOF ITSELF AND THAT WE DON'T END UP PICKING WINNERS AND LOSERS IN THE WATER WAR I'M SO THE BIG PICTURE IS I THINK WE NEED- WE NEED WE REALLY NEED TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE'RE WE'RE GOING TO PUT OUR RESOURCES INTO. RECYCLING TO ABOUT CAPTURING THESE- FLOOD YEARS THAT THAT HAPPENED IN IN OUR REGION CREATE OPPORTUNITIES TO TAKE THAT WATER AND- SAVE IT UP BUT BUT I ALSO. AM FRUSTRATED THAT WHEN THE STATE GETS TO A DROUGHT THE DIFFERENT REGIONS ARE ASKED TO DO DIFFERENT THINGS DESPITE THE FACT THAT TWO THIRDS OF OUR RESIDENTS. TAKE WATER FROM THE DELTA. SO IF TO OF OUR TO OUR RESIDENTS ARE TAKING WATER FROM THE DELTA AND WE HAVE A DROUGHT THAT EVERYBODY SHOULD BE TOLD YOU YOU HAVE TO CONSERVE AND THAT MEANS. PUTTING MANDATORY CONSERVATION- OBLIGATIONS ON EVERYONE AND TO DO IT BY REGION TO ME JUST DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE BECAUSE FRANKLY IT ALWAYS ENDS UP HITTING THE CENTRAL ALLEY THAT YOU GOT IT. YOU GET NOTHING IN YOU'VE GOT TO CONSERVE TO BUT IN REGARDS TO YOUR PARTICULAR. BELL HERE'S WHAT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT AND YOU NEED TO KNOW THAT ALL THE WATER AGENCY OR ARE OPPOSED AND I TAKE VERY SERIOUSLY THE CONCERNS. IF YOU DO A PER CAPITA RESIDENCES THAT TO AFFECT THE MOST ARE THOSE THAT ARE THE POOREST AND IT'S BECAUSE IF YOU'RE POOR. AND YOU ON. BUT IN MY REGION IF YOU'RE POOR AND YOUR AN AGRICULTURAL WORKER YOU USUALLY HAVE. MANY MANY ADULTS LIVING IN IN THAT UNIT AND SO THERE'S A SOME SHINS THAT THE WATER COMPANIES USE THAT SAY THERE'S TWO ADULTS AND TWO CHILDREN RIGHT IN IT IN A TWO BEDROOM. UNIT IN IN IN MY REGION ARE EXPERIENCES THAT COULD BE TEN ADULTS AND FOUR CHILDREN AND SO YOU GET A WATER ALLOCATION AND IF YOU IF YOU USE MORE THAN THAT YOU GET. A PENALTY. ANYTHING OVER THAT ALLOCATION YOU PAY MORE FOR AND SO THE REGION WHEN WE DID THIS PER CAPITA ANALYSIS OR ARE IN POSITION. THE LAST DROUGHT. IN IN MY AREA THE PEOPLE THAT WERE REALLY HURT WHERE WERE THE POOREST AND SO I'M I'M VERY CONCERNED WITH WITH HOW THIS GETS- DETERMINED WE LEAVE IT UP TO THE WATER WE TELL THEM THIS IS WHAT WE WANT YOU TO DO WE LEAVE IT UP TO THE WATER COMPANY AND IT WAS. ABOUT IN MY MIND IT WAS- ABUSIVE ABUSIVELY USED BECAUSE THERE WAS NO WAY FOR PEOPLE TO FILE A APPEAL. FOR TO KNOW WHAT THEY COULD DO IF THEY WERE ASSESSED A HIGHER WATER RATES UP BECAUSE THAT'S THE WAY THAT THE COMPANY HAD SET UP THEIR PROGRAM. AND THE STATE DIDN'T HAVE A WAY TO GO BACK AND TELL THEM YOU YOU DETRIMENTALLY HURT POOR PEOPLE IN- IN IMPLEMENTING THIS PROGRAM AND SO YOU HAVE TO MAKE IT RIGHT SO THAT'S- AYE THAT'S MY BIGGEST CONCERN ABOUT IT WE NEED TO BE FAIR- AND HOPEFULLY THIS LEGISLATURE WILL LOOK AT. MORE BROADER SOLUTIONS. ABSOLUTELY NO QUESTION WE HAVE TO CONSERVE- AND SOME AREAS ARE DOING A REALLY GOOD JOB BUT WE ALSO NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE DIFFERENCES IN- IN RESIDENTIAL YOU UNITS AND NOT ALL OF THEM ARE EQUAL SO. THANK YOU WITHOUT I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND IT I BOUGHT YOU MISTER CHAIR I TO WAS NOT GOING TO SPEAK ON THIS ISSUE BUT AS MANY OF YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN WORKING ON THIS ISSUE BECAUSE OF ALL THE IMPACTS THAT. AND THE SHORTAGES OF WATER THAT WE HAVE IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND- BILLION I WANT TO SPEAK TO IT. IN IN TERMS OF THE BIG PICTURE RIGHT I THINK THIS IS. THE GREATEST CHALLENGE FACING MANKIND TODAY. WATER SCARCITY WATER SECURITY. YOU SEE WATER SECURITY MEANS MUCH MORE THAN JUST WATER AND WATER SECURITY IS NOT JUST ABOUT CANALS OR STORAGE ISSUES- EVEN THOUGH IT IS A HUGE PART OF IT. OUR WATER SECURITY IS ALSO A HUMAN SECURITY ISSUE. IMPACTS OF POOR WATER MANAGEMENT IN CALIFORNIA THREATEN THE SAFETY AND WELLBEING OF ALL PEOPLE. I'M MORE CONCERNING IT THREATENS OUR DEMOCRACY AND OUR VERY OWN EXISTENCE. LET ME SAY THAT AGAIN POOR WATER MANAGEMENT THREATENS OUR DEMOCRACY AND OUR VERY OWN EXISTENCE. WATER INSECURITY CAN AND WILL LEAD TO SOCIAL DISRUPTION IF LEFT UNFIXED AND IT'S NOT SOMETHING I JUST KIND OF THREW OUT THERE IT'S SOMETHING THAT ACTUALLY. I WAS PUT IN IN THE MOST RECENT- IPCC REPORT BACK IN FEBRUARY. AND SO WE MUST DO EVERYTHING THAT WE CAN TO MAKE THIS MOMENT AT WATER BEYOND CALIFORNIA AND YES CONSERVATIONISTS. BUT PART OF IT. BUT WE REALLY HAVE TO LOOK AT THE OTHER WAYS THAT WE MUST PROTECT THE LIMITED WATER THAT WE HAVE. BECAUSE THAT IS ALSO ON THE LINE AND I WANT TO BE ABLE TO GIVE AN EXAMPLE ONE OF THE REPORTS THAT CAME OUT BACK IN TWENTY TWELVE. ON THE GLOBAL WATER SECURITY- THE STATE AT EIGHT IT CONFIRM THREE DIFFERENT THINGS ONE WATER MAYBE POTENTIALLY USED AS LEVERAGE OVER NEIGHBORS TO PRESERVE WATER INTEREST TO WATER MAY BE USED AS A WEAPON WITH SOME UPSTREAM NATIONS IMPEDING OR CUTTING OFF DOWNSTREAM. FLOW TO PRESSURE POPULATIONS OR SUPPRESS THEM. THREE WATER MAY BE USED AS A FORM OF TERRORISM. PHYSICAL INFRASTRUCTURE LIKE DAMS WILL BECOME TARGETS OF TERRORIST. NOW I KNOW IT SOUNDS LIKE A HOLLYWOOD. LIKE A SCARY HOLLYWOOD MOVIE. BUT THE REALITY IS THAT THIS IS THIS IS THIS IS A VERY MUCH VERY MUCH A REALITY HERE AT HOME. AND IT'S- SOMEWHAT VIDEO TERRORIST ATTEMPTS ARE ALREADY OCCURRING QUIETLY IN THE FORM OF CYBER ATTACKS ON ALL THINGS WATER. WATER IS BEING USED AS LEVERAGE AT THIS POINT AND I WANTED. EXPLAIN A LITTLE BIT AND WHAT THAT MEANS. JUST LAST YEAR THERE WAS AN ATTACK ON ONE OF OUR WATER TREATMENT SYSTEM HERE IN CALIFORNIA WHERE THERE ARE CHEMICALS USED TO TREAT WATER WERE JUST TO DEBT LEVELS BY A HACKER. FORTUNATELY THAT THE ADJUSTMENTS WERE NOTICED BEFORE ANYONE FELL ILL AND WATER WAS CONTAMINATED. NOW WITH THE SITUATION IN UKRAINE RUSSIA IS USING CYBER THREATS AS A FORM OF LEVERAGE IN MY OPINION THEY HAVE. ARE THERE WAS A- AB. THERE'S BEEN EFFORTS IN THE WE GOT TO REALLY LOOK AT ALL THINGS WATER WHEN IT COMES TO THE CYBER ATTACK ATTEMPTS. AND I WANNA GIVE ANOTHER EXAMPLE IN TWENTY THIRTEEN IT. A UKRAINIAN HACKER. ENTERED INTO THE COMMAND CONTROL SYSTEM OF A DOWN IN THE STATE OF NEW YORK. LUCKILY THE GATE HAD BEEN MANUALLY DISCONNECTED FOR MAINTENANCE THAT DAY. HAD IT NOT THE DAM WATER WOULD HAVE BEEN RELEASED SO WE TALK ABOUT WATER CONVERT AT CONSERVATION I AGREE WE REALLY NEED TO WE NEED TO QUANTIFY WATER IN ALL SENSES RIGHT AND INCLUDING THE CONSUMPTION THAT WE- THAT THAT WE WANT TO USE IN OUR OWN HOMES I THINK THAT'S- THAT'S PART OF IT BUT I ALSO THINK WE HAVE TO BE VERY. CAREFUL AND CAUTIOUS ABOUT. HOW WE APPROACH IT THE ISSUES THAT ARE IN FRONT OF US WHEN IT COMES TO WATER BE WE SHOULD BE PRIMARILY FOCUSED ON. THE LEAKAGES THAT ARE ALREADY EXISTED AND THAT'S WHY I YOU KNOW I SPONSORED SENATE BILL FIVE FIVE NINE BECAUSE IT WOULD ALLOW FOR ADDITIONAL WATER TO GO DOWN AND ACROSS THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE STATE. YES A RUN THROUGH THE CENTRAL VALLEY BUT THIRTY ONE MILLION CALIFORNIANS RELY ON THAT THAT'S ADDITIONAL A FIX THAT'S ADDITIONAL WATER MOVED FOR MORE PEOPLE. FOR MORE COMMUNITIES FOR THE ENVIRONMENT. I SEE THAT AS A FORM OF CONSERVATION. AND SO. I THINK CYBER SECURITY ALSO IT'S PREVENTATIVE RIGHT TO PROTECT THE WATER THE VERY LIMITED WATER THAT WE HAVE TODAY. I THINK WE GOT TO BE ABLE TO DO ALL THESE THINGS BEFORE WE EVEN GO AND ASK ON WATER TO LIMIT EVEN MORE. AND WE HAVE A AND I'M JUST THINKING ABOUT THE PEOPLE THAT I REPRESENT OF THE CENTRAL VALLEY WHEN THEY'RE GOING THROUGH A HUNDRED AND THREE DEGREES. SOME COMMUNITIES GO WITHOUT WATER OUR AND WATER IS JUST KINDA EIGHT NEEDED TO LIVE AND TO SURVIVE SO IMAGINE HAVING TO ASK A COMMUNITY THAT HAS GONE WITHOUT WATER OR HAS VERY LIMITED WATER IN THE EXTREME HEAT OF THE CENTRAL VALLEY. ASKING THEM TO BE YOU KNOW TO- CONSERVE MORE I JUST. I THINK IT COULD BE IT COULD BE A LITTLE UNFAIR WE GOTTA THINK ABOUT THOSE THINGS BUT I DO THINK THAT WE MUST DO MORE. AND I THINK WE CAN DO MORE BUT WE GOT TO GET IT. WE GOTTA GET IT RIGHT. SO I WILL BE NOT SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY BUT I REALLY WANT TO WORK WITH THE AUTHORED. SUPPORT THE BUILT ON THE ROAD THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR GROW. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT HOW TO WAS NOT INTENDING TO SPEAK ON THIS BILL BUT I'D LIKE TO JUST COME IN ON SOME STUFF THAT WAS ALREADY SAID ON THE FLOOR- IF YOU LOOK AT THE U. S. EPA REPORTS IT SAYS THAT. ONE POINT SIX GALLONS TAKES TO FLUSH TOILETS. THE AUTHOR SAYS THAT IT DOESN'T AFFECT- HOUSEHOLD IN USE OUR TOILET USAGE. BUT IF YOU ONLINE- IF I LINE MY COMMENTS WITH MY COLLEAGUES FROM. THE SALINAS AREA. WHO ALSO REPRESENTS PART OF THE VALLEY- IT DOES BECAUSE THE ALTHOUGH THIS BILL WILL AFFECT AGENCIES THESE AGENCIES WILL PUT. A CAP OR A PRO RATA SHARE- PER HOUSEHOLD. IN MY COLLEAGUES FROM SALINAS IS EXACTLY RIGHT THAT IT AFFECTS POOR PEOPLE. COMPLETELY DISPROPORTIONATELY. A REPRESENTING THE CENTRAL VALLEY A SPECIFICALLY A LOT OF FARMWORKERS IN MY COMMUNITY THAT I'VE FOUGHT HARD. AND FOR. A LOT OF THINGS THAT THIS BUILDING OPPOSES. ONE THING COMES TO MIND WHEN THEY THINK ABOUT- WHEN I THINK ABOUT BILLS THAT HAVE GONE TO THIS BUILDING WAS THE- OVERTIME CUT ON WHICH TO CONFIRM SIXTY TO FORTY HOURS IN THOSE FARMWORKERS. EVEN AT MINIMUM WAGE LOSS THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH. AND NOW THESE FARMWORKERS AND THE PEOPLE IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY WHERE THE POOREST PART OF OUR COMMUNITIES ARE. WILL BE AFFECTED BY THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION. BECAUSE THE WATER AGENCIES WILL DETERMINE. THAT TWO POINT FIVE ADULTS AND THREE KIDS ARE FOR KIDS LIVE IN A TWO BEDROOM UNIT LIKE MY COLLEAGUE FROM SALINAS SAID. AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT- THEY WILL PAY THOSE OVERAGE FEES ON LESS RESOURCES OR LESS DISPOSABLE INCOME BECAUSE THEY'RE PAYING HIGHER COSTS FOR FUEL. AND HIGHER COSTS FOR LIVING A GROCERIES AND EVERYTHING WITH INFLATION. I CAN TELL YOU THAT UNDER THE U. S. EPA IT ALSO SAYS THAT IT TAKES ABOUT FOUR GALLONS. IF YOU HAVE ANY. TOP OF THE LINE IF FISSION ENERGY EFFICIENT. TOP OF THE LINE DISHWASHER. I CAN TELL YOU THAT A LOT OF THE COMMUNITIES IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY SPECIFICALLY IMPORTER BILL WHERE MIGHT A COLLEAGUE FROM THE CENTRAL VALLEY JUST SPOKE IN SHARES KERN COUNTY WITH ME. WE HAVE PEOPLE IMPORTER BILL THAT DON'T HAVE WATER IN THEIR HOME AND THEY DELIVERED WATER TO A BIG BLACK TANK OUTSIDE. THE NAY BUT GIDEON LIKE IT. LIKE THEY DID WHEN I WITH THE GUADALAJARA NASTY POT IN MEXICO WHERE THEY CARRIED THE WATER ON THEIR HEAD. FROM AT OF THE MAJOR WATER SOURCE IN THE CENTER OF TOWN. YEARS AGO WHEN I WAS A CHILD. SO THEY GET THIS WATER IT'S DELIVERED ON THESE BLACK BUT IN THEIR FRONT YARD OF THESE BIG BLACK TANK. AND THEN THEY CARRIED INTO THEIR HOUSE THIS BILL IS GOING TO AFFECT THOSE PEOPLE THE POOREST IN OUR COMMUNITY. IT SAYS THAT IT TAKES TWENTY GALLONS TO WASH THESE DISHES BY HAND. PEOPLE ARE GOING TO DO THEIR DISHES THESE PEOPLE ARE VERY. VERY FAMILY ORIENTATED VERY CLEAN INDIVIDUALS THEY CARE DEEPLY ABOUT THE WAY THEIR HOUSE FLICKS- EVEN SOME OF THEM THAT HAVE CRAXI MEANT THAT THEY LIVE ON- WE VISITED WITH THEM THEY CARE DEEPLY ABOUT THE WAY THEIR HOUSE LOOKS. AND THEY'RE GOING TO DO THEIR DISHES BUT THEY DON'T HAVE A HIGH ENERGY EFFICIENT DISHWASHER THAT'S ONLY GONNA USE FOUR GALLONS- THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS MY COLLEAGUE FROM FRESNO MY COLLEAGUE FROM TO HEMA PUT FORTH THAT BILL TO ALREADY USE. WATER RESOURCES THAT WERE ALREADY ALLOCATED BY THE VOTERS IN ORDER TO BUILD WATER STORAGE IT WAS SHOT DOWN IN THE FIRST COMMITTEE AS IT WAS STATED EARLIER. I CAN TELL YOU THERE'S NEW BIOLOGICAL OPINIONS ON AL FLOWS INTO THE DELTA WERE MORE WATER CAN BE SENT TO THE CENTRAL VALLEY- IN. THESE INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE NOT HAPPEN DON'T HAVE ENOUGH WATER ALREADY WOULD HAVE WATER. I CAN TELL YOU THAT REPRESENTING. WITH MY COLLEAGUES FROM FRESNO THE TOP THREE FOOD PRODUCING COUNTIES IN THE WORLD THAT I REALIZE THIS IS AN IN HOME ISSUE. BUT WE NEED WATER TO GROW FOOD. TOP THREE FOOD PRODUCING COUNTIES IN THE ENTIRE WORLD AND LIKE I SAID I KNOW THIS BILL DOESN'T AFFECT THAT. AND I DO BELIEVE THAT WE ALL NEED CONSERVATION BECAUSE WE CANNOT CONSERVE OUR WAY OUT OF THIS SITUATION. SO ITMAKES ME SICK TO MY STOMACH THAT WATER IS JUST A VOLATILE POLITICAL ISSUE. WE SHOULD ALL COME TOGETHER. AND WORK ON THIS ISSUE AND MAKE SURE THAT. EVERY SINGLE CALIFORNIAN HAS A RIGHT TO WATER INCLUDING THOSE IMPORTER BILL THAT HAVE NOT HAD WATER IN ALMOST TWO AND A HALF YEARS. THE GO TO THE DITCH TO GET WATER TO BRING BACK TO THEIR HOUSE TO WASH CLOTHES. IF YOU WERE TO SIT DOWN AND TALK TO THE FARMWORKERS IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY THOUSANDS OF THEM WOULD TELL YOU. THAT THE BIGGEST STRUGGLE THEY HAVE IS SOME OF THE POLICIES THAT COME OUT OF THIS BUILDING THAT CREATE MORE COST FOR THEM. THIS BILL IS EXACTLY LIKE THIS NO MATTER HOW WELL INTO IT IT IS. WE DEFINITELY WATER INFRASTRUCTURE RIGHT ASK YOU ALL TO LOOK AT THE BILL THAT WAS BROUGHT FORTH BY MY COLLEAGUE FROM FRESNO ENTERTAINMENT. SO THAT WE COULD ACTUALLY LOOK AT ALLOCATING RESOURCES FOR WATER INFRASTRUCTURE. I APPLAUD MY COLLEAGUES FRIENDS AND KINGS COUNTY. FROM SANGER WHO- ACTUALLY GOT RESOURCES FOR FIVE NINE NINE FOR DELIVERY SYSTEM SO THAT SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. CAN'T CONVEY WATER FROM NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR NO VOTE. THANK YOU ANY FURTHER THE DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THIS ITEM. ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION DEBATE HEARING TINA SYNERGY BURKE WHICH LIKE TO CLOSE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR PRESIDENT IS A LOT OF ISSUES THAT ARE RAISED I JUST WANNA. DEAL WITH A HANDFUL OF THEM AND I WANT TO THANK. THE SENATORS MY COLLEAGUES FOR THE DISCUSSION AND CERTAINLY REFLECTING THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS CRITICAL ISSUE IN ALL CORNERS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I KNOW THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT ARGUED INVOLVING FIRES AND PROP ONE BUT IS- CENTER FROM RIVERSIDE SAID THEY'RE NOT MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE IT SEEMS TO ME THAT IF WE HAD A BILL UP. SO TO SPEAK DEALING WITH MILES PER GALLON TO BE ABLE TO INCREASE THE MILEAGE OF AUTOMOBILES. THE FOLKS AND SAY NO WE CAN'T DO THAT BECAUSE WE GOT TO GET INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINES OFF THE- OFF THE ROAD. CERTAINLY IT'S AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE LARGER CONTEXT BUT IT IS NOT THE CORE OF THIS BILL. THE QUESTION I AS AND I WANT TO JUST THE POVERTY ISSUE IN SOME OF THESE OTHER ISSUES I THINK ARE IMPORTANT BUT BASICALLY. WHAT IF WE DIDN'T CONSERVE VERSIONS WE GET CONSERVE WATER FOR RIGHT PERSONS WERE WRONG. YOU FOR ME FOR WRONG THE WORST CASE SCENARIO IS. THAT WE HAVE MORE WATER TO GROW MORE FOOD IN THE STATE WHERE AGRICULTURE IS SO IMPORTANT HE FOR WRONG WILL HAVE MORE WATER FOR THE ENVIRONMENT. THEN THE FISHY SO MANY OTHER THINGS THAT MEET THE DISCUSSION OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE FACE. OKAY WONDERFUL RIGHT WHAT IF THIS WAS SUGGESTED BY MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES WE DO RUN OUT OF WATER WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH THAT WE NEED TO GET AHEAD OF THE GAME IS THE CHAIR OF THE WATER COMMITTEE SAID TO GET AHEAD OF THIS PROCESS AND TO BE SMART ABOUT IT RIGHT SO WHAT IS THE IMPACT WHAT ARE WE REALLY TALKING ABOUT HERE IS BECAUSE WE ARE MEETING THOSE GOALS LET ME LET ME JUST ADDRESS A COUPLE OF ISSUES WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. THEM I WON'T TAKE TOO MUCH TIME OKAY NUMBER ONE COST IMPACT ON PEOPLE OF LESSER MEANS A TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN STUDY BY THE ALLIANCE FOR WATER EFFICIENCY FOUND THAT THE LOS ANGELES DEPARTMENT OF WATER AND POWER CONSERVE THE CONSERVATION PROGRAM AVOID THE BILL ELEVEN BILLION DOLLARS IN WATER COST CONSUMER BILLS CUSTOMERS BILLS 426% LOWER THAN THEY OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE BEEN IN TERMS OF IMPACT ON PEOPLE OF LESSER MEANS WATER COSTS. SECOND THE IDEA. OF LOOKING AT THIS HOLISTICALLY AND SAYING LESS WATER PER PERSON WHAT IS A GALLON PER. PER CAPITA PER DAY BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE STANDARDS WHAT YOU'RE REQUIRED TO LOOK AT HERE. IS IT'S NOT CHEST. URBAN WATER SUPPLIERS RETAIN THE EXISTING FLEXIBILITY UNDER THIS BILL IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE. O MEET THEIR WATER OBJECTIVES. CALCULATED BY THE FOLLOWING NOT JUST HOW YOU FLUSH YOUR TOILET HOW LONG YOU TAKE A SHOWER YES IT INCLUDES INDOOR RESIDENTIAL USAGE. INCLUDES OUTDOOR RESIDENTIAL USES COMMERCIAL INDUSTRIAL INSTITUTIONAL OUTDOOR WATER USAGE SYSTEM WIDE WATER LOSSES. GIVES CREDIT FOR VARIANCES WERE ACCOUNTS ARE UNIQUE TO LOCAL SITUATIONS. AND INCLUDES POTABLE REUSE BONUSES INCENTIVE ADJUSTMENTS WHICH IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT TO ORANGE COUNTY WHICH IN MY JUDGMENT HAS BY ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE THE PLATINUM STANDARD THE BEST STANDARD FOR. WATER RECYCLING A HUNDRED THIRTY THOUSAND ACRE FEET THEY ARE THE BEST IN THE BUSINESS. AND SO THE CHALLENGES I WILL TALK TO THE SENATOR FROM IRVINE ABOUT BECAUSE I'VE SPENT A LOT OF TIME STUDYING THIS. SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE BIG PICTURE IN TERMS OF CONSERVATION CAN WE DO IT. I WILL GO THROUGH THE DETAILS BECAUSE WE'RE OUT OF TIME BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS YES WE CAN YES WE CAN. THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT. ARE THIS REALLY IS ABOUT THE NEXT GENERATION THIS REALLY IS ABOUT YOUR GRANDCHILDREN THIS REALLY IS ABOUT GOVERNING NOT FOR THE NEXT ELECTION. BUT FOR THE NEXT GENERATION THAT IS WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE TO GET AHEAD OF THE CURVE. FOR SOMETHING THAT'S SO IMPORTANT IN THE COMMUTER URBAN COMMITTEES I REPRESENT LOS ANGELES THERE'S NOT A NEIGHBORHOOD COUNCIL THAT I CAN'T GO TO. THE DOESN'T TALK ABOUT WATER BECAUSE WE IMPORT WATER AND WE HAVE TO LOS ANGELES. ESPECIALLY WITH WHAT'S HAPPENING AT THE COLORADO RIVER STE WE ALREADY OVER DREW OUR OUR ALLOCATION BY NINE HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRE FEET. TO REDUCE OUR DEMAND TO REDUCE OUR DEMAND IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA FOR THE ENVIRONMENT FOR AGRICULTURE SO. IF WE DO REDUCE OUR DEMAND WE HAVE A LARGER PICTURE. OF WHAT WE'RE HERE. IT'S NOT A BAD THING IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENING TECHNOLOGICALLY ISRAEL WHAT DID THEY DO. GEISHA'S SYSTEM WHAT DO YOU DO IN AGRICULTURE RFID RADIO FREQUENCY TAGS ACTUALLY THE TREE AND TELL YOU HOW MUCH WATER IT NEEDS. TECHNOLOGY HAS BEEN BRILLIANT ACROSS THE GLOBE TO BE ABLE TO DEAL WITH WATER IN A MUCH MORE ELEGANT WAY. THAN HOW WE'RE DEALING WITH IT IT IS SO IMPORTANT IS A HUMAN RIGHT IT IS ALL OF THOSE THINGS THAT A MOLDED FOLKS TO STAND TODAY. AND SO THE BOTTOM LINE IS THIS IS AN IMPORTANT BILL I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR CALIFORNIA OVER ONE MILLION CUSTOMERS. WHERE WHERE WHERE WHERE INTERVIEWED A HUNDRED FIFTY WATER AGENCIES THIS IS NOT SOMETHING YOU JUST PULLED OFF THE SHELF BUT IT WAS THE RESULT OF TWO YEARS OF STUDY. FROM OUR GOVERNMENT WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND THE LIKE I ASK YOUR RIVALS. THANK YOU HELLO THIS. BETA SECTOR PLEASED THE ROLL ON FILE ITEMS SEVEN. TH ALLEN. I ARCHULETA. AYE ATKINS. AYE BATES.
