EARLIER THIS YEAR THIS COMMITTEE HEARD ASSEMBLY BILL SIXTY ONE WHICH TOGETHER WITH SB THREE ONE FOUR WOULD CREATE A NECESSARY LIFELINE FOR RESTAURANTS AND BARS. THE PANDEMIC HAS DEVASTATED SMALL BUSINESSES PARTICULARLY IN THE HOSPITALITY INDUSTRY AT AN ALARMING RATE SINCE THE FIRST DAY HOME ORDER THIS INDUSTRY HAS SUSTAINED. A BIG ECONOMIC HIT AND CONTINUES TO STRUGGLE TO REGAIN ALL THAT HAS BEEN LOST. AS WE TRY TO REGAIN A SENSE OF NORMALCY MANY OF OUR LOCAL BUSINESSES WILL BE ONE STEP AWAY FROM BANKRUPTCY AND EASING ARBITRARY ABC RESTRICTIONS WILL BE CRITICAL TO THEIR SUCCESS AFTER THE PANDEMIC AND BEYOND. RESTAURANTS AND BARS THROUGHOUT THE STATE ARE IN DIRE NEED OF FLEXIBILITY WITHINTHE A. B. C. ACT AS MANY OF ANTIQUATED LAWS INCLUDED IN IT MAKE IT MUCH HARDER TO CONDUCT BUSINESS. SB THREE ONE FOUR PROVIDES FLEXIBILITY FOR RESTAURANTS AND BARS IN FOUR WAYS. FIRST BUSINESSES THAT HAVE A COVER NINETEEN TEMPORARY EXPANSION PERMIT. WILL BE ALLOWED TO CONTINUE OPERATING FOR AT LEAST ONE YEAR AFTER THE EMERGENCY ORDER SELECTED. YOU CAN APPLY FOR PERMANENT PROMISES EXPANSION AT THE SAME TIME. THIS EXPANDED OUTDOOR SEATING AND SERVICE AREAS HAVE ALLOWED RESTAURANTS AND BARS TO SURVIVE AND HAVE BEEN WILDLY POPULAR WITH THE PUBLIC. IF AFTER ONE YEAR GRACE PERIOD BUSINESS HAS SUBMITTED AN APPLICATION FOR PERMANENT EXPANSION A. B. C. CAN EXTEND THE GRACE PERIOD IF THEY SO CHOOSE. SECOND THIS BILL ALLOWS MANUFACTURERS THE ABILITY TO SHARE A COMMON LICENSE AREA WITH MULTIPLE LICENSE RETAILERS SUCH AS BARS RESTAURANTS OR OTHER MANUFACTURERS. THIRD THE BILL ALLOWS BUSINESSES TO USE A CATERING LICENSE AT ONE LOCATION THIRTY SIX TIMES INCREASING THE ALLOWABLE LIMIT FROM TWENTY FOUR. LASTLY CURRENTLY AN EVENT MUST SUBMIT THEIR PERMIT APPLICATION TO A. B. C. MORE THAN THIRTY DAYS BEFORE THE EVENT. THIS BILL WILL INCREASE THE SPIRIT OF THE TIME TO NINETY DAYS BEFORE AN AND INSTEAD OF THE CURRENT THIRTY DAY WINDOW. THESE CHANGES WILL HELP US ADAPT AND MOVE FORWARD FROM THE CHALLENGES WE FACE DURING THE PANDEMIC AND ENSURE THAT IN THE FUTURE THESE REGULATIONS ARE MORE USER FRIENDLY FOR THESE BUSINESSES.

SO GOING TO MOVE ON TO THE NUMBER OF FOLLOWERS NUMBER THREE SB THREE EIGHTY NINE THE WORLD FAMOUS ILLUSTRIOUS MISTER DODD. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS I WOULD LIKE TO BEGIN BY ACCEPTING ALL THE AMENDMENTS LISTED IN AL-SISI'S. I ALSO WANT TO THANK YOU AND YOUR COMMITTEE STAFFER YOU WORK ON THE BILL THIS BILL DOES TWO THINGS THE FIRST IS TO CODIFY LAST YEAR'S REGULATORY RELIEF THAT ALLOWED RESTAURANTS. THE ABILITY TO SELL BOTH PRE PACKAGED ALCOHOL DRINKS IT PREMIXED DRINKS TO CUSTOMERS AS FAR AS THEIR- TO GO MEALS ORDER. THE ABILITY TO CALL ALCOHOLIC DRINKS IS BEEN A LIFE WHY DO OUR RESTAURANT IN. INDUSTRY DURING COVERT NINETEEN THIS BILL SIMPLY EXTENDS THE AUTHORITY FOR FIVE YEARS IN GIVES RESTAURANTS THE OPTION TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE. FIVE ALCOHOL DRINKS AS PART OF THEIR MAIL ORDER. IN ADDITION THE BILL REQUIRES THIRD PARTY DELIVERY COMPANIES WHO ARE DELIVERING ALCOHOL BE HAPPY I'LL CALL LICENSEE. TO OBTAIN A PERMIT FOR THE DEPARTMENT ABC. I WANT TO POINT OUT- TO BE VERY CLEAR THAT THIS DOES NOT LEGALIZE OF DELIVERY OF ALCOHOL. BY THIRD PARTY DELIVERY COMPANIES. THAT CLEARLY IS ALREADY TAKING PLACE IT WILL CONTINUE TO OCCUR REGARDLESS OF THIS BILL. WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS PROVIDE TO COMMONSENSE APPROACH TO GIVE THE DEPARTMENT OF ABC. THE NECESSARY OVERSIGHT TO ENSURE THE DELIVERIES ARE BEING DONE IN A RESPONSIBLE MANNER THE PROTECTS AGAINST UNDERAGE DRINKING IN OVER INTOXICATION. SPECIFICALLY THIS BILL REQUIRES DELIVERY DRIVERS WHO ARE DELIVERING ALCOHOL TO COMPLETED TRAINING IT AUTHORIZES ABC TO IMPOSE FINES ON THIRD PARTY DELIVERY COMPANIES. NOT DELIVERY DRIVERS I DON'T THINK SO AND WITH THE AMENDMENTS TAKEN TODAY. THIS BILL MAKES A VERY CLEAR THE DEPARTMENT BBC CAN SUSPEND OR REVOKE A CONSUMER DELIVERY SERVICE PERMIT. WHEN THE CIRCUMSTANCES WARRANT SUCH DISCIPLINE I'LL CONTINUE TO WORK CLOSELY WITH THIS COMMITTEE STAKEHOLDERS. AND THE DEPARTMENT ABC TO ENSURE THAT THIS BILL IS BOTH WORKABLE AND ENFORCEABLE WITH ME. IT JOHN LATIMER ON BEHALF OF SEVEN ELEVEN IN THE CALIFORNIA RETAILERS ASSOCIATION. MISTER SUTTON MISTER SAID WANT TO GO AHEAD AND START YOUR TESTIMONY AND- SUPPORT. GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS MATT SUTTON OF THE CALIFORNIA RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT OF THE LEGISLATION I THINK SENATOR DODD EXPLAINED IT WELL THIS IS ACTUALLY ADDING PROTECTIONS TO EXISTING LAW WELL MAKING A SLIGHT EXPANSION OF WHAT CAN BE DELIVERED AND I WOULD JUST POINT OUT THAT RESTAURANTS. MAY BE ALLOWED TO REOPEN FULLY SINCE JUNE FIFTEENTH THAT WE ARE NOWHERE NEAR FULLY RE OPEN AND CONSUMER DEMANDS AND DESIRES HAVE CHANGED AND A BILL LIKE THIS ALLOWS US TO CONTINUE TO FULFILL THOSE DESIRES OF CONSUMERS AND COMMUNITIES IN A SAFE WAY AND SO WE ARE IN SUPPORT. THE Q. NEXT WITNESS THE SLAMMER. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS JOHN LATIMER ON BEHALF OF THE RETAILERS ASSOCIATION SEVEN ELEVEN AND I WOULD BUILD UPON- FOR MR SUTTON SAID SPEAKING JUST TO THE DELIVERY PORTION OF THE BILL FOR A MOMENT. AGAIN I THINK THE AUTHOR EXPLAINED IT WELL THIS IS CURRENTLY LEGAL HOWEVER. IT IS NOT JUST SIMPLY HOW DO WE KEEP THIS GOING IN A POST PANDEMIC ENVIRONMENT THE USE OF DELIVERY SERVICES BY CONSUMERS HAS BEEN RISING YEAR AFTER YEAR BECAUSE IT'S AN IMPORTANT VALUABLE. BENEFIT TO THEM. ONE OF MY CLIENTS SEVEN ELEVEN STORES ALONE DID OVER HALF A MILLION TRANSACTIONS LAST YEAR. BEGIN PRE COVERED THROUGH COVERT OVER HALF MILLION TRANSACTIONS THAN DID INVOLVE THE SALE OF ALCOHOL.THAT'S LEGAL AND PERMISSIBLE TODAY HOWEVER WHEN THERE IS A BREAK DOWN IN THE DELIVERY WHEN THERE'S A MISTAKE MADE ANY MINOR IS GIVEN ACCESS TO THAT PRODUCT THE ABC HAS NO. MEANS REGULATORY LEAD TO ATTACH ANY RESPONSIBILITY TO A DELIVERY COMPANY INSTEAD THEY COME BACK TO YOUR RETAILER YOUR RESTAURANT IN YOUR DISTRICT. WE WANT TO WORK WITH THE DELIVERY COMPANIES THEY'RE REALLY IMPORTANT PARTNERS AGAIN THEY'RE VALUABLE TO OUR TO OUR CONSTITUENTS OUR CUSTOMERS IN YOUR CONSTITUENTS HOWEVER. WE HAVE TO ESTABLISH A REGULATORY MODEL FOR THEM WHERE BY THE DEPARTMENT AN ENFORCE AGAINST THEM IF IT'S NECESSARY. THAT DOESN'T HURT THE DELIVERY COMPANIES IT DOESN'T HURT THE DRIVERS FRANKLY IT MAKE SURE THAT THE PENALTY GOES TO THE DELIVERY COMPANY. SO WE THINK THIS IS AN IMPORTANT STEP THAT HELPS KEEP THIS GREAT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN RETAIL RESTAURANT AND DELIVERY COMPANIES GOING. LEADER DRIVE UP. THANK YOU. SO WE'RE GONNA GO INTO THE GALLERIA IF ANY MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION. IN THE GALLERY. SEEING NONE WE'RE GONNA MOVE ON TO- THE PHONES THERE IS A ONE WITNESS- LISTED IN OPPOSITION- SHANE GOODMAN FROM THE COOPERATIVE TEAMSTERS AND- MODERATOR WOULD YOU PLEASE OPEN THE LINE FOR MISTER GOODMAN.

HAS DRAFTED SB THREE EIGHTY NINE WOULD CREATE A CONSUMER DELIVERY SERVICE PERMITS FOR THIRD PARTY DELIVERY PLATFORMS NEGATIVELY THIS CHANGE WILL SHIFT LIABILITY FROM RESTAURANT THE VULNERABLE DELIVERY DRIVERS MANY OF WHOM ARE CLASSIFIED AS INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS WE APPRECIATED CENTER DOTTED THE KNOWLEDGE THEY NEED TO IMPROVE THE STATUS QUO OR ALCOHOL DELIVERIES ARE TAKING PLACE RIGHT NOW WITHOUT ANY OVERSIGHT THAT'S REFLECTING THE AUTHOR'S WILLINGNESS TO WORK WITH THE COMMITTEE ON THE STEP THAT PENALTY STRUCTURE. WITHOUT MORE OVERSIGHT FOR THE ABC AS WELL THAT SAID IT IS UNCLEAR- WHO THE PENALTY ACTUALLY FALLS ON OUR READING IS THAT BECAUSE THE CLASSIFICATION THE DRIVERS AND INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS THE PENALTIES COULD BE PUSHED OFF OF THE LICENSE CONSUMER DELIVERY SERVICE ARTIST'S WORK FORCE AS WE KNOW THESE DRIVERS ACTED HARMONY IN THE DISCRETION TO DETERMINE WHO RECEIVE ALCOHOL OR TO REFUSE TO EVERY. THAT IS WELL REFLECTED IN THE ABC'S APRIL TWENTY TWENTY VI&lt;c.cyan&gt; THREE IN WHICH THE&lt;/c&gt; DEPARTMENT CONCLUDED THAT DELIVERY APPS LOG I'M MUCH WORSE RATED SELLING ALCOHOL TO MINORS IN FACT IN FOUR OUT OF FIVE INSTANCES A MINOR COULD BE EXACTLY ORDER AN ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGE THROUGH DELIVERY AFTER IT AFTER A COMPANY THEIR LICENSE UNDER STATUTE THE NEED TO SHARE RESPONSIBILITY FOR PENALTIES RESULTING FROM DRIVER MISCONDUCT WHICH WOULD SIMPLY CREATE PARITY WITH BRICK AND MORTAR LICENSEES WHERE THE FAILURE RATE AND SELLING TO MINORS IS SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER- UNDER EXISTING LAW WHEN HE DIRECTED PLAYED A LICENSEE FURNISHES ALCOHOL TO MINORS THE LIABILITY FALLS THE PERMIT HOLDER. BE A VICARIOUS LIABILITY WE SEE NO REASON NOT TO MERE THAT. EXISTING STRUCTURE BY ADDING QUITE- FIND LANGUAGES THE BILL WILL GO LONG WAY TOWARD THE YOU ACTUALLY FALL. ALTERNATIVELY COMMAND THE TRACK TO LIVE OUT CALL COST TO. THE EMPLOYEES I THE CONSUMER DELIVERY. YOUR CALIFORNIA KENNETH DRY ARE TO BE DIRECTING OF THE- DISPENSARY FOR LARGELY THE SAME RE. EITHER WAY WE WOULD INSIST HE BILL CREATES A MORE ROBUST LICENSING STRUCTURE SO THAT COMPANIES LICENSES CONSUMER DELIVERY SERVICES IN THE STATE ACTUALLY CARRY LIABILITY.
