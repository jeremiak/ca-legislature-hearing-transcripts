00:12:09.862 --> 00:12:11.063
TO ADVISE THAT OFFICE THE

00:12:11.130 --> 00:12:12.731
LEGISLATURE ANY ADMINISTRATION

00:12:12.798 --> 00:12:14.133
ON THE CREATE EXPIRATION OF THIS

00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:15.267
DATABASE.

00:12:15.334 --> 00:12:16.402
AS YOU ALL KNOW CALIFORNIA

00:12:16.469 --> 00:12:17.703
COLLECTS A MASSIVE AMOUNT OF

00:12:17.770 --> 00:12:19.205
DATA ABOUT STUDENTS HOWEVER THE

00:12:19.271 --> 00:12:20.439
DATA COLLECTED.

00:12:20.506 --> 00:12:22.208
IS MAINTAINING SYSTEMS THAT ARE

00:12:22.274 --> 00:12:23.442
NOT AT ALL CONNECTED.

00:12:23.509 --> 00:12:25.177
AS A RESULT OF THESE DISCONNECTS

00:12:25.244 --> 00:12:26.612
IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT

00:12:26.679 --> 00:12:29.615
STUDENT PROGRESS IS OFTEN

00:12:29.682 --> 00:12:30.816
IMPOSSIBLE TO ACCESS.

00:12:30.883 --> 00:12:31.584
A STARK EXAMPLE OF WHY THIS IS

00:12:31.650 --> 00:12:33.619
NEEDED. THIRTY TWO THOUSAND

00:12:33.686 --> 00:12:35.287
STUDENTS WHO QUALIFIED FOR CSU

00:12:35.354 --> 00:12:37.756
ADMISSION LAST FALL WERE DENIED.

00:12:37.823 --> 00:12:39.325
BUT WITHOUT A LONGITUDINAL DATA

00:12:39.391 --> 00:12:41.127
SYSTEM WE HAVE NO IDEA WHAT

00:12:41.193 --> 00:12:42.428
BECAME OF THEM DID THEY GO TO

00:12:42.495 --> 00:12:43.729
COMMUNITY COLLEGE TO THEY GO TO

00:12:43.796 --> 00:12:44.864
A PRIVATE UNIVERSITY DID THEY

00:12:44.930 --> 00:12:46.165
MOVE OUT OF STATE.

00:12:46.232 --> 00:12:47.833
THEY JUST ENTER THE WORK FORCE

00:12:47.900 --> 00:12:49.535
WITHOUT A COLLEGE EDUCATION.

00:12:49.602 --> 00:12:50.870
THESE INFORMATION GAPS ARE SICK

00:12:50.936 --> 00:12:52.505
ARE SIGNIFICANT WEAKNESS IN

00:12:52.571 --> 00:12:53.806
CALIFORNIA'S CURRENT APPROACH

00:12:53.873 --> 00:12:55.174
WE'RE UNABLE TO ANSWER IMPORTANT

00:12:55.241 --> 00:12:56.942
QUESTIONS ABOUT STUDENT PROGRESS

00:12:57.009 --> 00:12:59.311

00:12:59.378 --> 00:13:01.113
THERE'S MANY EXAMPLES OF THAT

00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:01.747
THAT UP.

00:13:01.814 --> 00:13:03.149
OF THESE TYPES OF QUESTIONS THAT

00:13:03.215 --> 00:13:04.617
WE CAN ANSWER WITH DATA AND MY

00:13:05.951 --> 00:13:07.019
OF THAT BACKGROUND.

00:13:07.086 --> 00:13:08.320
OUR STUDENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES

00:13:08.387 --> 00:13:09.922
ARE BETTER OFF IF THEY KNOW WHAT

00:13:09.989 --> 00:13:11.290
HAPPENED IN THE PAST -- WITH

00:13:11.357 --> 00:13:12.291

00:13:17.630 --> 00:13:19.365

SKILLED WORKFORCE GROWS WHILE

00:14:26.765 --> 00:14:30.869

CALIFORNIA'S DECISION MAKERS ARE

00:14:36.542 --> 00:14:38.777
ACTING IN AN INFORMATION VACUUM.

00:14:38.844 --> 00:14:40.446
THE STATE HAS A VERY LIMITED

00:14:40.512 --> 00:14:41.847
ABILITY TO DIAGNOSE ITS

00:14:41.914 --> 00:14:43.382
CHALLENGES IN EDUCATION --

00:15:00.432 --> 00:15:01.667
BECAUSE SYSTEMATICALLY

00:15:01.734 --> 00:15:03.669
INTEGRATING DATA FROM PRESCHOOL

00:15:03.736 --> 00:15:05.070
TO WORKFORCE IS A KEY STEP FOR

00:15:05.137 --> 00:15:06.872
CALIFORNIA TO MODERNIZE.

00:15:06.939 --> 00:15:09.308

00:15:10.709 --> 00:15:13.112
PREVENTS POLICYMAKERS FROM

00:15:13.178 --> 00:15:14.813
PINPOINTING WHERE CALIFORNIANS

00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:16.248

00:15:18.884 --> 00:15:20.653
HOW THAT VARIES BY RACE GENDER

00:15:20.719 --> 00:15:22.655
REGION AND INCOME AND MOST

00:15:22.721 --> 00:15:24.723
IMPORTANTLY WHY IT HAPPENED IT'S

00:15:24.790 --> 00:15:25.758
MIND BOGGLING THAT OUR STATE

00:15:25.824 --> 00:15:27.526
CAN'T ANSWER SEEMINGLY

00:15:27.593 --> 00:15:29.028

INDEPENDENTLY HOLD RICH DATA BUT

00:15:45.544 --> 00:15:46.945
THE SEGMENTED APPROACH LIMITS

00:15:47.012 --> 00:15:48.247
UNDERSTANDING OF HOW THE

THROUGH THROUGH THE CHAIR THANK

00:18:31.343 --> 00:18:31.944
YOU SENATOR PAT I THINK THE HOPE

YOUR UNDERSTANDING A LITTLE

00:30:37.969 --> 00:30:39.037
UNDER THE WEATHER SO.

00:30:39.103 --> 00:30:40.872
IF YOU'LL BEAR WITH ME ON THAT --

00:30:40.939 --> 00:30:42.440
APPROXIMATELY FOUR YEARS AGO WE

00:30:42.507 --> 00:30:43.174
HAD A NEIGHBORING SCHOOL

00:30:43.241 --> 00:30:45.310
DISTRICT THAT WAS UNABLE TO

00:30:45.376 --> 00:30:46.644
CONTINUE THEIR DAY CARE PROGRAM

00:30:46.711 --> 00:30:48.313
IN OUR SCHOOL BOARD WANTED TO

00:30:48.379 --> 00:30:49.147
OFFER UP.

00:30:49.214 --> 00:30:51.015
OUR TIKI PROGRAM IS A SOLUTION

00:30:51.082 --> 00:30:51.649
FOR SOME OF OUR COMMUNITY

00:30:51.716 --> 00:30:52.817
MEMBERS.

00:30:52.884 --> 00:30:54.586
SO THEY DECIDED HIM I WILL TAKE

00:30:54.652 --> 00:30:56.321
THE TIME OUR BUDGET WAS WAS

00:30:56.387 --> 00:30:58.022
HEALTHY FOR A SCHOOL DISTRICT SO

00:30:58.089 --> 00:31:00.525
WE DECIDED TO ALLOW ALL COMERS.

00:31:00.592 --> 00:31:02.994
WHO TURN FIVE IN THE PREVIOUS

00:31:03.061 --> 00:31:03.661
SCHOOL YEAR TO COME INTO OUR T.

00:31:03.728 --> 00:31:03.995
K.?

00:31:04.062 --> 00:31:05.597
BUT WE DIDN'T REALIZE IS THAT

00:31:05.663 --> 00:31:08.366
OUR T. K. WOULD GROW BY 60%.

00:31:08.433 --> 00:31:10.435
SO WE TOOK AN ADDITIONAL 60% OF

00:31:10.501 --> 00:31:12.170
STUDENTS AND THAT DIDN'T QUALIFY

00:31:12.237 --> 00:31:13.471
FOR THE FULL YEAR FUNDING

00:31:13.538 --> 00:31:15.273
OBVIOUSLY THIS BECAME A BURDEN

00:31:15.340 --> 00:31:19.744
ON OUR SCHOOL DISTRICT WE WERE

00:31:19.811 --> 00:31:21.646
ABLE TO CARRY IT FOR THREE YEARS.

00:31:21.713 --> 00:31:22.280
GENTLY WE'VE HAD TO NOW BILL THE

00:31:22.347 --> 00:31:22.914
WAITING LIST FOR THE FOLLOWING

00:31:22.981 --> 00:31:23.781
YEAR WE WE CAN NO LONGER

00:31:23.848 --> 00:31:25.016
SUPPLANT -- THAT THE YOUNGER

00:31:25.083 --> 00:31:28.486
STUDENTS NOW IN OUR MIND.

00:31:28.553 --> 00:31:30.021
I WILL TELL YOU I'VE I'VE SHARED

00:31:30.088 --> 00:31:31.189
THE STORY WITH SUPERINTENDENTS

00:31:31.256 --> 00:31:32.357
ACROSS THE STATE I THINK WE'RE

00:31:32.423 --> 00:31:33.224
ALL ON THIS PRETTY MUCH ON THE

00:31:33.291 --> 00:31:34.659
SAME FIELD.

00:31:34.726 --> 00:31:36.361
IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO US THAT

00:31:36.427 --> 00:31:38.429
YOU HAVE HALF OF THE CLASS OF

00:31:38.496 --> 00:31:39.297
STUDENTS.

00:31:39.364 --> 00:31:40.598
IT'S GOING INTO KINDERGARTEN THE

00:31:40.665 --> 00:31:42.967
FOLLOWING YEAR THAT'S ALLOWED TO

00:31:43.034 --> 00:31:44.335
HAVE T. K. AND THE PREP WORK

00:31:44.402 --> 00:31:46.137
GOING INTO KINDERGARTEN.

00:31:46.204 --> 00:31:48.239
YET WE'RE DENYING THE OTHER HALF

00:31:48.306 --> 00:31:49.741
OF THAT CLASS THIS GOING INTO

00:31:49.807 --> 00:31:52.143
THE SAME CLASSROOM THE FOLLOWING

00:31:52.210 --> 00:31:54.345
YEAR BUT IS THE NINETY K..

00:31:54.412 --> 00:31:55.913
BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE THE

00:31:55.980 --> 00:31:57.448
FUNDING FOR OUR OUR LIMITED

00:31:57.515 --> 00:31:59.584
FUNDING -- I'M SURE YOU'RE GONNA

00:31:59.651 --> 00:32:00.985
HEAR SOME RESULTS VERY SHORTLY

00:32:01.052 --> 00:32:02.453
THE T. K. PROGRAM IS OF A

00:32:02.520 --> 00:32:04.088
QUALITY PROGRAM IS CREDENTIALED

00:32:04.155 --> 00:32:05.590
TEACHERS IT HAS A BASED

00:32:05.657 --> 00:32:06.424
CURRICULUM.

00:32:06.491 --> 00:32:07.058
I CAN TAKE FROM PERSONAL

00:32:07.125 --> 00:32:09.127
EXPERIENCE -- OUR PARENTS OUR

00:32:09.193 --> 00:32:10.595
COMMUNITY ARE THRILLED TO HAVE

00:32:10.662 --> 00:32:12.297
THAT OPPORTUNITY AND I HOPE IN

00:32:12.363 --> 00:32:13.631
THE FUTURE I WON'T HAVE TO BUILD

00:32:13.698 --> 00:32:15.600
THAT WAITING LIST BECAUSE IT'S

00:32:15.667 --> 00:32:19.203
IT'S VERY DESTRUCTIVE TO OUR

00:32:19.270 --> 00:32:22.473
COMMUNITY -- I TAKE OUT THE LAST

00:32:22.540 --> 00:32:24.475
SINGLE I WILL CLOSE WITH IS THE

00:32:24.542 --> 00:32:26.878
OLD ADAGE NO AND I I UNDERSTAND.

00:32:26.944 --> 00:32:29.013
HOW THIS HOW IT WORKED WITH THE

00:32:29.080 --> 00:32:30.214
MARIN BOARD OUR OWN BUDGETS?

00:32:30.281 --> 00:32:31.082
THERE'S AN OLD ADAGE BY

00:32:31.149 --> 00:32:32.050
SUPERINTENDENTS AND SAY YOU KNOW

00:32:32.116 --> 00:32:32.617
SCHOOL BOARD CAN DO ANYTHING

00:32:32.684 --> 00:32:32.917
THEY WANT.

00:32:32.984 --> 00:32:33.584
THEY JUST CAN'T DO EVERYTHING SO

00:32:33.651 --> 00:32:34.986
I CAN SEE THAT TO THE COMMITTEE

00:32:35.053 --> 00:32:35.787
I REALIZE THAT THERE ARE

00:32:35.853 --> 00:32:37.555
CHALLENGING ENTITIES FOR FOR

00:32:37.622 --> 00:32:38.623
FUNDING.

00:32:38.690 --> 00:32:40.325
BUT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT -- AN

00:32:40.391 --> 00:32:42.427
EFFECTIVE PROGRAM -- THAT SHOWS

00:32:42.493 --> 00:32:44.529
SIGNIFICANT RESULTS IN SHOULD BE

00:32:44.595 --> 00:32:47.265
OPEN TO THE ENTIRE CLASS OF FIVE

00:32:47.332 --> 00:32:47.932
YEAR OLDS GOING INTO

00:32:47.999 --> 00:32:49.267
KINDERGARTEN RATHER THAN JUST

INSTITUTES FOR RESEARCH.

00:33:00.611 --> 00:33:01.946
WITH OUR A. I. R. TEAM I LET THE

00:33:02.013 --> 00:33:03.047
STATEWIDE STUDY OF TRANSITIONAL

00:33:03.114 --> 00:33:06.417
KINDERGARTEN FROM 200-014-32000.

00:33:06.484 --> 00:33:07.051
SIXTEEN AND I'D LIKE TO SHARE

00:33:07.118 --> 00:33:09.153
SOME OF WHAT WE FOUND TO INFORM

00:33:09.220 --> 00:33:10.621
YOUR CONSIDERATION OF THIS FALL.

00:33:10.688 --> 00:33:11.889
THE STUDY COMPARED OUTCOMES IN

00:33:11.956 --> 00:33:13.324
KINDERGARTEN FOR KIDS YOUR AGE

00:33:13.391 --> 00:33:14.959
ELIGIBLE FOR KINDERGARTEN SO

00:33:15.026 --> 00:33:15.526
THOSE BORN BEFORE DECEMBER

00:33:15.593 --> 00:33:17.195
SECOND. TWO KIDS WHO WERE

00:33:17.261 --> 00:33:20.031
SIMILAR IN AGE BUT JUST MISSED

00:33:20.098 --> 00:33:21.265
THE AGE CUTOFF FOR TKA MOST OF

00:33:21.332 --> 00:33:22.533
WHOM ATTENDED ANOTHER CENTER

00:33:22.600 --> 00:33:23.968
BASED BECAME PROGRAM.

00:33:24.035 --> 00:33:25.603
THIS IS A VERY RIGOROUS DESIGN

00:33:25.670 --> 00:33:28.506
FOR STUDY AND INCLUDED OVER SIX

00:33:28.573 --> 00:33:29.140
THOUSAND STUDENTS THROUGHOUT THE

00:33:29.207 --> 00:33:31.042
STATE.

00:33:31.109 --> 00:33:31.876
WE FOUND UNDERSTANDING T. K.

00:33:31.943 --> 00:33:33.177
GIVE STUDENTS A THREE MONTH

00:33:33.244 --> 00:33:34.946
LEARNING ADVANTAGE OVER THEIR

00:33:35.012 --> 00:33:37.148
NANTI K. PEERS AND MATH SKILLS A

00:33:37.215 --> 00:33:38.449
KINDERGARTEN ENTRY.

00:33:38.516 --> 00:33:39.851
T. K. ALSO SHOULDN'T IMPACT ON

00:33:39.917 --> 00:33:41.753
STUDENTS LITERACY SKILLS PUTTING

00:33:41.819 --> 00:33:42.754
THEM AHEAD OF THEIR NANTI K.

00:33:42.820 --> 00:33:44.355
PAIRS BY SIX MONTHS I CAN -- AN

00:33:44.422 --> 00:33:47.825
ENTRY AND SHOWING A PERSISTING

00:33:47.892 --> 00:33:49.293
IN FACT AT THE END OF THE YEAR.

00:33:49.360 --> 00:33:50.728
A RECENT STUDY BY CHRISTOS AT

00:33:50.795 --> 00:33:51.429
RAND COMPARING THE TWO K.

00:33:51.496 --> 00:33:52.964
PROGRAMS OTHER PRESCHOOL

00:33:53.030 --> 00:33:53.498
PROGRAMS AND SAN FRANCISCO

00:33:53.564 --> 00:33:55.133
UNIFIED.

00:33:55.199 --> 00:33:56.534
CAME TO SIMILAR CONCLUSIONS.

00:33:56.601 --> 00:33:57.502
WE ALSO FOUND THAT THERE IS NO

00:33:57.568 --> 00:33:58.836
DIFFERENCE AND CHILDREN SOCIAL

00:33:58.903 --> 00:34:00.371
SKILLS AS RATING RATED BY

00:34:00.438 --> 00:34:02.140
TEACHERS BETWEEN TWO K. IN

00:34:02.206 --> 00:34:03.975
COMPARISON CREEK STUDENTS. TWO

00:34:04.041 --> 00:34:05.610
K. HAS A PARTICULARLY STRONG

00:34:05.676 --> 00:34:07.078
IMPACT TO SENATOR MENTIONED ON

00:34:07.145 --> 00:34:08.179
SOME STUDENTS TO MAKE UP A

00:34:08.246 --> 00:34:09.414
REALLY LARGE PORTION OF OUR

00:34:09.480 --> 00:34:10.815
STUDENT BODY IN CALIFORNIA.

00:34:10.882 --> 00:34:12.517
WE SAW VERY POSITIVE EFFECTS ON

00:34:12.583 --> 00:34:14.018
ENGLISH LANGUAGE SKILLS FOR

00:34:14.085 --> 00:34:15.553
ENGLISH LEARNERS AND ALSO ON

00:34:15.620 --> 00:34:17.388
MATH SKILLS FOR LOW INCOME

00:34:17.455 --> 00:34:19.424
STUDENTS. ONE OF THE INTERESTING

00:34:19.490 --> 00:34:20.124
THINGS THAT WE NOTED IN THE

00:34:20.191 --> 00:34:22.026
STUDY WAS THAT VARIATIONS IN THE

00:34:22.093 --> 00:34:24.562
SPECIFIC ELEMENTS CITY KAY.

00:34:24.629 --> 00:34:26.164
SO SMALL CHANGES IN TEACHER

00:34:26.230 --> 00:34:27.598
CHILD RATIOS CLASSROOM

00:34:27.665 --> 00:34:29.300
OBSERVATION RATINGS FOR USE OF

00:34:29.367 --> 00:34:30.835
PARTICULAR INSTRUCTIONAL

00:34:30.902 --> 00:34:32.303
STRATEGIES SUCH A SMALL GROUPS

00:34:32.370 --> 00:34:35.339
DID NOT CHANGE THE IMPACT THAT

00:34:35.406 --> 00:34:36.274
T QUê HAD FOR STUDENTS.

00:34:36.340 --> 00:34:37.708
SO WE THINK THIS MAY BE BECAUSE

00:34:37.775 --> 00:34:38.943
THE ELEMENTS THAT TICKET

00:34:39.010 --> 00:34:40.645
CLASSROOMS ALL HAVE IN COMMON.

00:34:40.711 --> 00:34:41.979
FOR EXAMPLE LOCATION AND

00:34:42.046 --> 00:34:43.448
ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS THAT MAY

00:34:43.514 --> 00:34:46.117
FACILITATE TRANSITIONS AND

00:34:46.184 --> 00:34:48.553
KINDERGARTEN -- CERTIFICATED AND

00:34:48.619 --> 00:34:50.154
WELL EDUCATED TEACHERS THE

00:34:50.221 --> 00:34:51.656
MAJORITY OF HIM TAUGHT

00:34:51.722 --> 00:34:53.491
KINDERGARTEN BEFORE.

00:34:53.558 --> 00:34:55.159
AND ALSO NINE MEANS TESTED

00:34:55.226 --> 00:34:57.094
CLASSROOMS WHERE CHILDREN OF ALL

00:34:57.161 --> 00:34:57.628
INCOME LEVELS CAN ATTEND

00:34:57.695 --> 00:34:58.496
TOGETHER.

00:34:58.563 --> 00:35:00.298
MAYBE THE MAIN DRIVERS OF THE

00:35:00.364 --> 00:35:01.566
PROGRAM'S IMPACT.

00:35:01.632 --> 00:35:03.301
THE STUDY FOCUSED ON CHILDREN IN

00:35:03.367 --> 00:35:05.136
THE CURRENT T. K. H. WINDOW NOT

00:35:05.203 --> 00:35:06.671
YOUNGER CHILDREN SUCH AS THIS

00:35:06.737 --> 00:35:08.206
RESURGENT ET QUEPROGRAMS.

00:35:08.272 --> 00:35:10.141
BUT BECAUSE WE SEE STRONG AND

00:35:10.208 --> 00:35:11.909
CONSISTENT IMPACTS OF T. K. FOR

00:35:11.976 --> 00:35:12.610
CHILDREN WITH THESE WHEN OUR

00:35:12.677 --> 00:35:14.078
BIRTHDAYS WE BELIEVE THAT THE

00:35:14.145 --> 00:35:15.880
SUGGESTS THAT DEVELOPMENTALLY

00:35:15.947 --> 00:35:17.448
APPROPRIATE AND RESPONSIVE ET

00:35:17.515 --> 00:35:18.282
QUE PROGRAMS.

00:35:18.349 --> 00:35:21.185
MAY ALSO HAVE A POSITIVE IMPACT

00:35:21.252 --> 00:35:21.752
FOR YOUNGER CHILDREN AS WELL

00:35:21.819 --> 00:35:22.053

I KNOW THAT THAT.

00:38:54.298 --> 00:38:54.799
YOU'RE AWARE THAT ARE A T.

00:38:54.865 --> 00:38:56.267
TEACHERS ARE REQUIRED TO HAVE

00:38:56.333 --> 00:38:57.401
TWENTY FOUR UNITS OF EARLY

CALIFORNIA FRAMEWORK A THEY ARE

00:39:03.407 --> 00:39:05.910
TRAINED IN THAT AS WELL AS I DO

00:39:05.976 --> 00:39:08.879
THE MANY MANY DEVELOPMENTAL --

00:39:08.946 --> 00:39:11.282
ASPECTS OF THE PROGRAM.

00:39:11.348 --> 00:39:13.050
SO THE READER -- DOESN'T REALLY

00:39:13.117 --> 00:39:14.518
COME INTO MUCH LATER WHEN YOU

00:39:14.585 --> 00:39:15.953

00:39:17.955 --> 00:39:19.023
AND DEVELOPMENTAL.

00:39:19.090 --> 00:39:20.291
A VERY DIFFERENT FROM WHAT MANY

00:39:20.357 --> 00:39:26.363

00:39:26.430 --> 00:39:28.299
CLASSROOMS LOOK LIKE.

00:39:28.365 --> 00:39:29.467

SO THAT'S NOT SO MUCH THE DIRECT

00:39:37.942 --> 00:39:39.710
CONCERN I THINK WE'RE LOOKING AT

00:39:39.777 --> 00:39:41.378
HOW THIS INTERFACE HAPPENS.

00:39:41.445 --> 00:39:42.747
AND SO THAT'S WHY I WANT TO BE

00:39:42.813 --> 00:39:44.014
SURE THAT WE'RE HAVING

00:39:44.081 --> 00:39:45.883
CONVERSATIONS WITH THE EARLY

00:39:45.950 --> 00:39:47.618

HOW WE'RE?

00:39:52.590 --> 00:39:53.357
PUTTING THESE PIECES TOGETHER

00:39:53.424 --> 00:39:55.292
AND RECOGNIZING THAT -- ACTUALLY

00:39:55.359 --> 00:39:57.128
OFTENTIMES MANY OF THE STUDENTS

00:39:57.194 --> 00:40:00.631

MAKING MONEY FOR THESE

00:50:38.602 --> 00:50:40.036
UNIVERSITIES -- IT IS WORTH

00:50:40.103 --> 00:50:41.238
MENTIONING THAT ATHLETIC

00:50:41.304 --> 00:50:42.339

00:54:58.461 --> 00:54:58.995
TO PASS THEY COULD THEY COULD

00:54:59.062 --> 00:54:59.696
PURSUE.

00:54:59.763 --> 00:55:01.564
THEY COULD CHOOSE TO SELF REPORT

00:55:01.631 --> 00:55:03.400
THESE VIOLATIONS AND DEAN OF

00:55:03.466 --> 00:55:04.734
STUDENT ATHLETES AND ELIGIBLE TO

00:55:04.801 --> 00:55:05.902
PARTICIPATE.

00:55:05.969 --> 00:55:07.170
IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT THE

00:55:07.237 --> 00:55:08.605
UNPAID STUDENT ATHLETES COULD

00:55:08.672 --> 00:55:10.440
CONTINUE TO COMPETE WITHOUT RISK

00:55:10.507 --> 00:55:12.075
OF FORFEITED GAMES.

00:55:12.142 --> 00:55:13.309
THEY COULD ALSO CHOOSE NOT TO

00:55:13.376 --> 00:55:14.911
REPORT THESE VIOLATIONS IN THE

00:55:14.978 --> 00:55:16.146
HOPES THAT VIOLATIONS GO

00:55:16.212 --> 00:55:17.514
UNNOTICED BY THE IN SITU WAY.

00:55:17.580 --> 00:55:18.381
BUT THAT EXPOSES OUR

00:55:18.448 --> 00:55:20.050
INSTITUTIONS TO EVEN MORE

00:55:20.116 --> 00:55:22.285
SIGNIFICANT PENALTIES IF AND

00:55:22.352 --> 00:55:22.886
WHEN DISCOVERED BY THE IN SITU

00:55:22.952 --> 00:55:24.988
AND IN EITHER INSTANCE.

00:55:25.055 --> 00:55:27.057
ATHLETIC TEAMS AND POTENTIALLY

00:55:27.123 --> 00:55:28.491
ENTIRE ATHLETIC DEPARTMENTS

00:55:28.558 --> 00:55:29.693
COULD VERY LIKELY BE FOUND TO BE

00:55:29.759 --> 00:55:31.961
IN VIOLATION OF NCAA BYLAWS

00:55:32.028 --> 00:55:33.530
CITING -- WHAT THEY WOULD REFER

00:55:33.596 --> 00:55:34.831
TO AS A LACK OF INSTITUTIONAL

00:55:34.898 --> 00:55:36.800
CONTROL I WHICH TEAM SCHOOLS ARE

00:55:36.866 --> 00:55:38.168
COMMITTING MAJOR AND REPEATED

00:55:38.234 --> 00:55:40.136
VIOLATIONS AND INSTITUTIONS HAVE

00:55:40.203 --> 00:55:41.237
FAILED TO DISPLAY ADEQUATE

00:55:41.304 --> 00:55:42.639
CONTROL MEASURES?

00:55:42.706 --> 00:55:43.773
AND EXAMPLES OF THESE TYPES OF

00:55:43.840 --> 00:55:44.874
PENALTIES AND SEVERITY CAN BE

00:55:44.941 --> 00:55:45.975
FOUND IN LOOKING AT WHAT

00:55:46.042 --> 00:55:48.044
HAPPENED TO USC -- IN THE LAST

00:55:48.111 --> 00:55:49.946
DECADE IN REGARDS THEIR FOOTBALL

00:55:50.013 --> 00:55:50.980
AND BASKETBALL PROGRAMS OUR

00:55:51.047 --> 00:55:53.116
AMONG OTHER THINGS THEY LOST

00:55:53.183 --> 00:55:54.250
THIRTY SCHOLARSHIPS.

00:55:54.317 --> 00:55:55.018
SO THESE PENALTIES CAN INCLUDE

00:55:55.085 --> 00:55:56.686
VACATED WINS POSTSEASON BANS

00:55:56.753 --> 00:55:58.455
LOTS OF MEDIA REVENUE WHICH IS

00:55:58.521 --> 00:56:00.090
REINVESTED TO THE BENEFIT OF ALL

00:56:00.156 --> 00:56:01.591
STUDENT ATHLETES BROADLY.

00:56:01.658 --> 00:56:02.392
AS WELL AS REDUCTIONS AS I

00:56:02.459 --> 00:56:03.426
MENTIONED STUDENT ATHLETIC

00:56:03.493 --> 00:56:04.794
SCHOLARSHIPS WHICH JEOPARDIZES

00:56:04.861 --> 00:56:06.963
OPPORTUNITIES FOR FUTURE STUDENT

00:56:07.030 --> 00:56:08.298
ATHLETES DOWN THE ROAD.

00:56:08.364 --> 00:56:09.733
IN CLOSING I JUST AGAIN WANT TO

00:56:09.799 --> 00:56:11.167
STRESS OUR INSTITUTIONS ARE NOT

00:56:11.234 --> 00:56:13.570
OPPOSED REFORMS THAT POTENTIALLY

00:56:13.636 --> 00:56:14.971
BENEFITS STUDENT ATHLETES THERE

00:56:15.038 --> 00:56:17.373
ARE A NUMBER OF EXAMPLES OF OF

00:56:17.440 --> 00:56:18.408
INITIATIVES AFTER THE IN SITU A

OUR INSTITUTIONS HAVE BEEN

00:56:21.945 --> 00:56:22.645
SUPPORTIVE OF THAT.

00:56:22.712 --> 00:56:26.015
HAVE ADDRESS THINGS -- LIKE THE

00:56:26.082 --> 00:56:27.817
THE GAP AND FINANCIAL SUPPORT

00:56:27.884 --> 00:56:30.186
FOR SOME STUDENT ATHLETES I

00:56:30.253 --> 00:56:30.754
BELIEVE IS REFERENCED IN THE

00:56:30.820 --> 00:56:32.322
ANALYSIS -- BUT AGAIN LACKING

00:56:32.388 --> 00:56:33.490

I THINK THIS IS A LONG TIME.

00:59:34.137 --> 00:59:36.973
BUT NEEDED LEGISLATION -- IT'S

00:59:37.040 --> 00:59:38.341
TOO BAD THAT HAS TO BE THROUGH

00:59:38.408 --> 00:59:40.276
LEGISLATION BUT BECAUSE IT SEEMS

00:59:40.343 --> 00:59:41.311
TO ME.

00:59:41.377 --> 00:59:43.212
THAT THE COLLEGES SHOULD HAVE

00:59:43.279 --> 00:59:44.681
MOVED IN THAT DIRECTION OR THE

00:59:44.747 --> 00:59:45.715
NCAA SO.

00:59:45.782 --> 00:59:48.051
MY QUESTION IS HOW DOES THIS FIT

00:59:48.117 --> 00:59:50.620
IN AND HOW DO YOU ADDRESS THE

00:59:50.687 --> 00:59:51.955
ISSUES OF HOW THE NCAA.

00:59:52.021 --> 00:59:55.591
COULD TAKE RETALIATION -- THOSE

00:59:55.658 --> 00:59:56.926
ARE MY WORDS COULD TAKE

00:59:56.993 --> 00:59:59.095
RETALIATION AGAINST CALIFORNIA

00:59:59.162 --> 01:00:02.699

01:00:04.667 --> 01:00:05.501
WHAT WE SAY?

01:00:05.568 --> 01:00:07.537
ABOUT ABOUT THAT BECAUSE I AS I

01:00:07.603 --> 01:00:10.039
UNDERSTAND IT THE REFORMS HAVE

01:00:10.106 --> 01:00:12.008
TO COME TO THE NCAA OR FEDERAL

01:00:12.075 --> 01:00:13.443
LAW.

01:00:13.509 --> 01:00:15.378
BUT WE NEED THESE CHANGES THE

01:00:15.445 --> 01:00:17.213
THE WAY OUR COLLEGE ATHLETES

01:00:17.280 --> 01:00:19.315
HAVE BEEN TREATED IS JUST.

01:00:19.382 --> 01:00:20.650
IT'S EMBARRASSING.

01:00:20.717 --> 01:00:21.884
WHEN YOU CONSIDER ALL THE MONEY

01:00:21.951 --> 01:00:24.087
AND I KNOW THE BIASES AND

01:00:24.153 --> 01:00:26.022
DISCRIMINATION AGAINST WOMEN?

01:00:26.089 --> 01:00:28.191
ATHLETES IN PARTICULAR.

01:00:28.257 --> 01:00:29.859
IS VERY EMBARRASSING SO.

01:00:29.926 --> 01:00:32.061
HOW DO WE ADDRESS THE FACT THAT

01:00:32.128 --> 01:00:34.497
IS REFORMS REALLY NEED TO HAPPEN

01:00:34.564 --> 01:00:35.631
AT THAT LEVEL?

01:00:35.698 --> 01:00:37.200
THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION AND I

01:00:37.266 --> 01:00:39.802
WILL -- GIVE YOU A SOME ANSWER

01:00:39.869 --> 01:00:42.238
AND THEN -- IT'S POSSIBLE THAT

01:00:42.305 --> 01:00:43.706
THE ANTI SWARTS MAY WANT TO ADD

01:00:43.773 --> 01:00:45.541
TO IT AS HE'S BEEN IN EXPERT

01:00:45.608 --> 01:00:48.144
WITNESS AT VARIOUS -- LAWSUITS

01:00:48.211 --> 01:00:51.014
AGAINST THE IN SITU A SO FIRST.

01:00:51.080 --> 01:00:52.682
THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME THAT

01:00:52.749 --> 01:00:53.850
THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE IS

01:00:53.916 --> 01:00:55.184
CONSIDERED SUCH A BILL.

01:00:55.251 --> 01:00:57.487
IF THIS WERE THE FIRST TIME WE

01:00:57.553 --> 01:00:59.155
WERE HAVING A DISCUSSION -- I

CREATING AWARENESS AND WE THINK

01:23:31.639 --> 01:23:33.241
THAT'S THAT HAS BEEN IMPORTANT.

01:23:33.308 --> 01:23:35.343
BUT IT'S ALSO HAS INCREASED THE

PASADENA ADAM SUPPORT.

01:38:47.321 --> 01:38:48.055
NOW THE REASON I BELIEVE A

01:38:48.122 --> 01:38:49.156
PASTOR THIS COMMITTEE WAS

01:38:49.223 --> 01:38:50.691
BECAUSE THIS COMMITTEE BELIEVE

01:38:51.825 --> 01:38:57.164

INHERENT IN THE HIGHER EDUCATION

01:38:57.865 --> 01:38:58.699
SYSTEM.

01:38:58.766 --> 01:38:59.833
IT'S A PROBLEM THAT THE MAJORITY

01:38:59.900 --> 01:39:01.302

01:39:01.368 --> 01:39:04.204
BROWN PAPA RECIPIENTS AND ROLLED

THE UC DID NOT GRADUATE WITH

01:39:04.838 --> 01:39:05.639
THEM.

01:39:05.706 --> 01:39:06.707
IT'S A PROBLEM THAT CALIFORNIA'S

01:39:06.774 --> 01:39:08.175
GOING TO EXPERIENCE A ONE TO ONE

01:39:08.242 --> 01:39:09.410

INSTITUTIONS OF FOR INSTITUTIONS

01:39:12.680 --> 01:39:14.181
WHEN THE ACTUAL REALITY SUCCESS

TO GRADUATION.

01:39:16.350 --> 01:39:17.651
NOW I HAVE TO WORK AT THE USES

01:39:17.718 --> 01:39:19.086
BEACON AT TRADE OFFICE AND TO

01:39:19.153 --> 01:39:20.321
THE REASON IS THAT OF THE POP

01:39:20.387 --> 01:39:21.355
AND WE DID A CALCULATION.

01:39:21.422 --> 01:39:22.856
WHAT WE FOUND WAS THAT IT WAS TO

01:39:22.923 --> 01:39:24.358
RECEIVE THE FULL POWER GRANT AS

01:39:24.425 --> 01:39:25.225
WELL AS THE INSTITUTIONAL GRANT

01:39:25.292 --> 01:39:27.728
IT'S STILL NOT COULD BE ENOUGH

01:39:27.795 --> 01:39:29.997
TO COVER THE TUITION CAP SPECIES

01:39:30.064 --> 01:39:30.664
WITH SOME COURSES?

01:39:30.731 --> 01:39:31.732
AT THIS BUT WE HAVEN'T START

01:39:31.799 --> 01:39:33.567
COUNTING THE COST OF HOUSING THE

COST OF FOOD TO THE COST OF

01:39:35.169 --> 01:39:35.369
TEXTBOOKS.

01:39:35.436 --> 01:39:37.004
SO I HAVE TO SIT THERE AND TELL

01:39:37.071 --> 01:39:37.604

SCHEDULE.

02:27:57.201 --> 02:27:58.703

THAT SURE AND THAT'S WHY WE WILL

02:49:17.480 --> 02:49:18.481
THAT'S WHY PART OF WHAT WE'RE

02:49:18.548 --> 02:49:19.949
TRYING TO DO HERE IS SET UP AN

02:49:20.016 --> 02:49:20.650
APPROPRIATE ADMINISTRATOR.

02:49:20.717 --> 02:49:21.718
APPROPRIATE ADMINISTRATIVE

02:49:21.784 --> 02:49:22.218
PROCESS.

02:49:22.285 --> 02:49:22.752
THAT GIVES BOTH SIDES THE

02:49:22.819 --> 02:49:24.954
OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT THEIR

02:49:25.021 --> 02:49:25.755
CASE -- THAT MAKE SURE THAT

02:49:25.822 --> 02:49:26.489
THERE ARE PROCEDURES FOLLOWED

02:49:26.556 --> 02:49:28.525
WHERE THE FACTS CAN BE

02:49:28.591 --> 02:49:32.362
ASCERTAINED IN A A NON BIASED OR

02:49:32.428 --> 02:49:34.364
I SHOULD SAY IMPARTIAL.

02:49:34.430 --> 02:49:37.767
ACCURATE AND FAIR MANNER SO THAT

02:49:37.834 --> 02:49:39.335
THE PROCESS THAT THEN.

02:49:39.402 --> 02:49:41.971
IN SHOES IS ONE THAT GETS TO THE

02:49:42.038 --> 02:49:45.241
ACCURACY OF THE ALLEGATIONS AND

02:49:45.308 --> 02:49:46.442
THE RESPONSE TO THOSE

02:49:46.509 --> 02:49:49.178
ALLEGATIONS AND THEN A FINDING

02:49:49.245 --> 02:49:51.414
BASED UPON A DETERMINATION OF

02:49:51.481 --> 02:49:57.854
WHETHER IT'S MORE LIKELY THAN

02:49:57.921 --> 02:49:59.422
NOT THAT THE EVENT OCCURRED.

02:49:59.489 --> 02:50:00.590
AND ALSO IT ADDRESSES THE FACT

02:50:00.657 --> 02:50:03.026
THAT EACH INSTITUTION -- IS ABLE

02:50:03.092 --> 02:50:04.894
TO SET FOR THE ITS OWN --

02:50:04.961 --> 02:50:07.530
RESPONSES ONCE A FINDING IS MADE.

02:50:07.597 --> 02:50:10.099
SO WE HEARD THE THE VICTIM OF

02:50:10.166 --> 02:50:11.334
THIS ASSAULT.

02:50:11.401 --> 02:50:13.503
TESTIFIED SHE HAD TO SEE THE HER

02:50:13.570 --> 02:50:17.140
RAPIST EVERY DAY -- AND YOU

02:50:17.206 --> 02:50:18.975
DIDN'T HEAR HER ASKING TO HAVE

02:50:19.042 --> 02:50:21.210
THAT PERSON -- REMOVED FROM

02:50:21.277 --> 02:50:24.581
CAMPUS TRANSOCEAN HAVE TO DEAL

02:50:24.647 --> 02:50:26.416
WITH THAT ON A DAILY BASIS.

02:50:26.482 --> 02:50:30.053
THE WHOLE NOTION OF TRAUMA BASED --

02:50:30.119 --> 02:50:33.356
A SENSITIVITY SO THAT A SHE HAD

02:50:33.423 --> 02:50:36.092
NEEDS TO TALK WITH PEOPLE AND

02:50:36.159 --> 02:50:37.594
POTENTIALLY A NEED TO HAVE

02:50:37.660 --> 02:50:39.862
THERAPY WHICH OBVIOUSLY WE SEE A

02:50:39.929 --> 02:50:43.032
LOT 34% OF WOMEN WHO ARE RAPED

02:50:43.099 --> 02:50:46.069
ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES WILL DROP

02:50:46.135 --> 02:50:47.470
OUT OF SCHOOL.

02:50:47.537 --> 02:50:49.405
IN GREAT MEASURE THAT'S BECAUSE

02:50:49.472 --> 02:50:51.507
THEY ARE NOT.

02:50:51.574 --> 02:50:53.676
ABLE OR NOR SHOULD WE ASK THEM

02:50:53.743 --> 02:50:55.478
TO HAVE TO FACE.

02:50:55.545 --> 02:50:57.880
THEIR PERPETRATOR ON A DAILY

02:50:57.947 --> 02:51:00.316
BASIS OR OFTENTIMES ARE IN THE

02:51:00.383 --> 02:51:01.417
SAME DORM IN THE SENT THE

02:51:01.484 --> 02:51:02.885
REQUEST OF THE VICTIM IS LOOK I

02:51:02.952 --> 02:51:04.120
JUST DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO SEE

02:51:04.187 --> 02:51:05.288
THIS PERSON.

02:51:05.355 --> 02:51:07.090
WHEN I WAKE UP IN THE MORNING IT

02:51:07.156 --> 02:51:08.391
CAN BE?

02:51:08.458 --> 02:51:11.494
A KIND OF A SEVERITY THAT WOULD

02:51:11.561 --> 02:51:14.063
JUSTIFY -- OF FREQUENTLY TO THE

02:51:14.130 --> 02:51:15.331
EXTENT THAT SCHOOLS HAVE EVEN

02:51:15.398 --> 02:51:17.433
BOTHERED TO TRY TO TAKE THESE

02:51:17.500 --> 02:51:18.968
CASES SERIOUSLY AND I THINK WE

02:51:19.035 --> 02:51:20.336
HAVE TO START FROM THAT

02:51:20.403 --> 02:51:22.672
FUNDAMENTAL PRINT PREMISE.

02:51:22.739 --> 02:51:24.273
IS THAT SCHOOLS ARE STILL THERE

02:51:24.340 --> 02:51:26.175
EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS.

02:51:26.242 --> 02:51:27.377
THIS IS A WHAT THEY ARE AND

02:51:27.443 --> 02:51:28.411
KNOWN.

02:51:28.478 --> 02:51:29.746
FOR AND THE FACT THAT WE ARE NOW

02:51:29.812 --> 02:51:31.114
REQUIRING THAT THEY TAKE

02:51:31.180 --> 02:51:33.549
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE STUDENTS

02:51:33.616 --> 02:51:34.817
WHO ATTEND THEIR SCHOOLS.

02:51:34.884 --> 02:51:37.720
THIS IS A ROAD MAP TO GIVE THEM

02:51:37.787 --> 02:51:41.924
OF THE KIND OF TOOLS THEY NEED

02:51:41.991 --> 02:51:42.325
TO DO THIS RIGHT.

02:51:42.392 --> 02:51:43.559
THE BES WAY TO DO THIS WOUD BE

02:51:43.626 --> 02:51:44.727
TO HAVE ALL THESE CASES TAKEN

02:51:44.794 --> 02:51:46.629
INTO CRIMINAL COURT AND WE HAVE

02:51:46.696 --> 02:51:48.131
A SYSTEM THERE THAT'S ALREADY

02:51:48.197 --> 02:51:49.465
WELL ESTABLISHED.

02:51:49.532 --> 02:51:51.501
BUT MOST OF THESE VICTIMS DON'T

02:51:51.567 --> 02:51:52.702
WANT TO DO THAT.

02:51:52.769 --> 02:51:54.504
AND WHAT OUR ULTIMATE GOAL IS TO

02:51:54.570 --> 02:51:56.739
STOP THIS KIND OF BEHAVIOR ON

02:51:56.806 --> 02:51:59.542
OUR COLLEGE CAMPUSES ONE IN FIVE

02:51:59.609 --> 02:52:00.309
WOMEN.

02:52:00.376 --> 02:52:02.311
ARE SEXUALLY ASSAULTED DURING

02:52:02.378 --> 02:52:04.380
THE COURSE OF THEIR CAREER.

02:52:04.447 --> 02:52:06.049
AND ONE IN FOURTEEN MEN.

02:52:06.115 --> 02:52:07.750
SO WE HAVE AN EPIDEMIC.

02:52:07.817 --> 02:52:09.952
THIS BILL TRIES TO ADDRESS THE

02:52:10.019 --> 02:52:11.087
FACT THAT.

02:52:11.154 --> 02:52:12.388
NUMBER ONE THIS DOES OCCUR.

02:52:12.455 --> 02:52:14.691
NUMBER TWO WE NEED TO MAKE SURE

02:52:14.757 --> 02:52:16.092
THAT THERE IS TO PROCESS FOR

02:52:16.159 --> 02:52:18.327
BOTH SIDES AND I THINK THAT.

02:52:18.394 --> 02:52:19.362
THERE IS CHOOSE ME THAT COMMON

02:52:19.429 --> 02:52:21.531
THREAD EVERYBODY WANTS TO HAVE A

02:52:21.597 --> 02:52:23.433
FAIR PROCESS THAT'S WHAT THIS

02:52:23.499 --> 02:52:26.269
BILL IS DESIGNED TO DO IS TO

02:52:26.335 --> 02:52:27.704
CREATE A FAIR PROCESS.

02:52:27.770 --> 02:52:31.107
RECOGNIZING THE NEEDS OF VICTIMS

02:52:31.174 --> 02:52:32.875
AND OF OF SURVIVORS OF

02:52:32.942 --> 02:52:34.644
RECOGNIZING THAT FOR MOST

02:52:34.711 --> 02:52:37.580
SURVIVORS RAPE IS A TRAUMATIC

02:52:37.647 --> 02:52:38.681
EXPERIENCE.

02:52:38.748 --> 02:52:40.083
AND THAT WE NEED TO ADDRESS IT

02:52:40.149 --> 02:52:41.417
IS SUCH.

02:52:41.484 --> 02:52:43.419
AN TO RECOGNIZE TO THAT THERE

02:52:43.486 --> 02:52:45.154
ARE SOMETIMES DIFFERENT POINTS

02:52:45.221 --> 02:52:46.756
OF VIEW AND THAT THOSE POINTS OF

02:52:46.823 --> 02:52:49.358
VIEW SHOULD BE ABLE TO BE

02:52:49.425 --> 02:52:50.793
PRESENTED TO WIN IT TO A AN

02:52:50.860 --> 02:52:53.496
INDEPENDENT NON BIASED FACT

02:52:53.563 --> 02:52:54.230
FINDER.

02:52:54.297 --> 02:52:55.765
AND THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL TRIES

02:52:55.832 --> 02:52:57.500
TO DO.

02:52:57.567 --> 02:52:58.801
CAN I RESPOND PLEASE NO THANK

PRIMARILY MEN OF COLOR BUT THAT

02:53:42.812 --> 02:53:45.748

02:53:45.815 --> 02:53:47.650
OF OUR JUDICIAL SYSTEM AS WE

02:53:47.717 --> 02:53:50.520
KNOW THAT RACISM HAS PLAYED A

02:53:50.586 --> 02:53:52.121
BIG ROLE IN A MUCH BIGGER ROLE

02:53:52.188 --> 02:53:53.156

02:53:53.222 --> 02:53:53.523
OTHER.

02:53:53.589 --> 02:53:56.325
EXTREME OF HOW VICTIMS AND WOMEN

WERE HERE WHEN I MENTIONED THAT

02:54:15.912 --> 02:54:17.647
THE BILL ALSO REQUIRES SCHOOLS

02:54:17.713 --> 02:54:20.049
TO PROVIDE TRAINING TO EMPLOYEES

02:54:20.116 --> 02:54:21.717
ENGAGED IN THIS PROCEDURE.

02:54:21.784 --> 02:54:23.519

02:54:27.256 --> 02:54:28.191
IMPLICIT BIAS.

02:54:28.257 --> 02:54:29.659
IN THE HISTORY OF INSTITUTIONAL

02:54:29.725 --> 02:54:32.028
RACISM AND RACIAL INEQUITIES IN

02:54:32.094 --> 02:54:34.530
SCHOOL DISCIPLINARY PROCESS SEES

02:54:34.597 --> 02:54:36.632
SO THAT WE HAVE THAT.

02:54:36.699 --> 02:54:37.767
AT SO THAT WE HAVE THAT --

02:54:37.834 --> 02:54:40.903
CONSCIOUSNESS AND RECOGNIZE THAT

02:54:40.970 --> 02:54:42.471
THERE ARE INSTANCES WHERE THEIR

02:54:42.538 --> 02:54:45.241
ASSUMPTIONS MADE IMPROPERLY --

02:54:45.308 --> 02:54:47.944
BASED UPON.

02:54:48.010 --> 02:54:49.345
RACIAL BIASES -- I WOULD ALSO

02:54:49.412 --> 02:54:51.747
LIKE TO MENTION TOO THAT THE

02:54:51.814 --> 02:54:53.382
DISTANT TEST TAKES AN AFRICAN

02:54:53.449 --> 02:54:54.684
AMERICAN WOMEN.

02:54:54.750 --> 02:54:56.786
BEING THE VICTIMS OF THE SEXUAL

02:54:56.853 --> 02:55:00.456
VIOLENCE ARE I THINK EVEN HIGHER

02:55:00.523 --> 02:55:02.491

02:55:02.558 --> 02:55:02.725
COLOR.

02:55:02.792 --> 02:55:04.460
SO AGAIN THIS IS SOMETHING WHERE

02:55:04.527 --> 02:55:07.029
WE WE NEED TO EDUCATE OURSELVES

02:55:07.096 --> 02:55:08.998
AND WE NEED TO EDUCATE THOSE WHO

02:55:09.065 --> 02:55:11.133

REDUCING THOSE TYPES OF

03:06:49.731 --> 03:06:50.866

THIS SHOULD BE A PART OF THE OUR

03:10:05.494 --> 03:10:06.061
APPROACH TO THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS

FORWARD -- WHEN I WAS A KID I

03:10:50.939 --> 03:10:51.873
NEVER IMAGINED THAT WE WERE

03:10:51.940 --> 03:10:53.341

INTO TOO MUCH IN THE WEEDS BUT

03:11:04.152 --> 03:11:06.154
MY CONCERN IS THAT AROUND

03:11:06.221 --> 03:11:09.891
SHOOTINGS AND IN SCHOOLS --

03:11:09.958 --> 03:11:11.960
THERE'S BEEN A BIGGER POLICY

03:11:12.027 --> 03:11:13.829
ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN.

03:11:13.895 --> 03:11:16.698
BROUGHT IN -- AROUND THE USE OF

03:11:16.765 --> 03:11:19.367
GUNS -- THERE'D BEEN PROPOSALS

03:11:19.434 --> 03:11:21.236
AND SOME OF SCHOOLS IN SOME

03:11:21.303 --> 03:11:24.005
STATES THAT TEACHERS SHOULD HAVE

03:11:24.072 --> 03:11:24.973
GUNS THAT.

03:11:25.040 --> 03:11:25.941
I MEAN YOU KNOW MAYBE

03:11:26.007 --> 03:11:27.943
MAINTENANCE SHOULD HAVE GUNS AND

03:11:28.009 --> 03:11:29.544
THE SORT OF STUFF SO.

03:11:29.611 --> 03:11:31.680
I'M TRYING TO PICTURE.

03:11:31.746 --> 03:11:32.614
MAKING SURE.

03:11:32.681 --> 03:11:35.483
HOW OR HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT

03:11:35.550 --> 03:11:37.919
WHILE THIS PREPARATION IS DONE

03:11:37.986 --> 03:11:40.055
IN THE BEST WAY POSSIBLE FOR THE

03:11:40.121 --> 03:11:42.390
CHILDREN PSYCHOLOGICALLY AND

03:11:42.457 --> 03:11:43.425
EVERY WHERE ELSE?

03:11:43.491 --> 03:11:45.160
IS THAT IT DOESN'T BECOME AN

03:11:45.227 --> 03:11:48.697
OPPORTUNITY. TO TALK ABOUT.

03:11:48.763 --> 03:11:50.565
OTHER POLICY ISSUES AND

03:11:50.632 --> 03:11:52.868
INCORPORATE THEM IN THAT AND NOT

03:11:52.934 --> 03:11:57.072
SOME I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THAT --

03:11:57.138 --> 03:11:58.206
HOW DO HOW DO WE?

03:11:58.273 --> 03:11:59.674
A AND IF IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY

03:11:59.741 --> 03:12:01.309
HAVE TO BE HERE BUT HOW DO YOU

03:12:01.376 --> 03:12:03.011
THINK WE SHOULD PROCEED WITH

03:12:03.078 --> 03:12:04.312
THAT SO THAT IT DIDN'T AND

03:12:04.379 --> 03:12:06.514
BECOME AN OPENING FOR ANOTHER

03:12:06.581 --> 03:12:08.817
POLICY DISCUSSION AROUND GUNS.

03:12:08.884 --> 03:12:10.585
THAT CERTAINLY WOULDN'T BE MY

03:12:10.652 --> 03:12:12.087
MOTIVATION WITH THIS BILL IT

03:12:12.153 --> 03:12:15.190
STRICTLY ON IT TO INSURE THAT MY

03:12:15.257 --> 03:12:17.659
CHILD YOUR CHILD.

03:12:17.726 --> 03:12:19.694
ANY CHILD WHO'S IN OUR AUDIENCE

03:12:19.761 --> 03:12:21.997
SCHOOL OFFENDING IS TOTALLY SAFE

03:12:22.063 --> 03:12:24.065
AND I THINK THAT OUR HEARTS YOU

03:12:24.132 --> 03:12:26.134
KNOW ACHE BLEED -- WHEN

03:12:26.201 --> 03:12:27.402
SOMETHING LIKE THIS HAPPENS I

03:12:27.469 --> 03:12:28.970
DON'T WANT A RECOUNT SOME OF

03:12:29.037 --> 03:12:30.438
THOSE THAT STILL GIVE ME A LUMP

03:12:30.505 --> 03:12:31.206
IN MY THROAT?

03:12:31.273 --> 03:12:34.175
SO THAT'S THE ONLY SINGLE INTENT

03:12:34.242 --> 03:12:34.876
OF THIS BILL THE THE LARGER

03:12:34.943 --> 03:12:37.379
DISCUSSION REGARDING HOW WE KEEP

03:12:37.445 --> 03:12:38.546
SCHOOLS SAFER.

03:12:38.613 --> 03:12:41.783
I THINK CARL WE'VE TALKED ABOUT

03:12:41.850 --> 03:12:43.418
NEEDLE ARMING SCHOOLS ARE YOU

03:12:43.485 --> 03:12:45.353
KNOW PUTTING FENCES AROUND EVERY

03:12:45.420 --> 03:12:46.821
ONE OF MANY MANY THOUGHTS COME

03:12:46.888 --> 03:12:47.088
FORWARD.

03:12:47.155 --> 03:12:48.356
BUT PROBABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT

03:12:48.423 --> 03:12:49.190
THING AND I THINK WE ALL KNOW

03:12:49.257 --> 03:12:51.559
THAT INDIVIDUAL YOU HAVE TO BE

03:12:51.626 --> 03:12:53.328
PREPARD.

03:12:53.395 --> 03:12:55.230
TO SURVIVE AND THE ONLY WAY WE

03:12:55.297 --> 03:12:56.464
CAN PREPARE TO SURVIVE WHETHER

03:12:56.531 --> 03:12:57.699
IT'S IN THE WILDERNESS OR IT'S

03:39:24.551 --> 03:39:26.353
CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION

03:39:26.419 --> 03:39:27.988
FIRST WANT TO SAY LOVE CODING WE

03:39:28.054 --> 03:39:29.456
ACTUALLY HAVE A COATING

03:39:29.523 --> 03:39:31.825
CATERPILLAR FOR OUR DAUGHTER SO --

03:39:31.892 --> 03:39:35.095
VERY MUCH -- LOVE THE CONCEPT

03:39:35.161 --> 03:39:35.862
WITH THE OF WITH THE MEASURES

03:39:35.929 --> 03:39:37.063
TRYING TO ACHIEVE UNFORTUNATELY

03:39:37.130 --> 03:39:38.598
CTA DOES OPPOSE THE MEASURE FOR

03:39:38.665 --> 03:39:40.333
TWO REASONS FIRST OF ALL THE

03:39:40.400 --> 03:39:41.868
BILL DOES CREATE A CATEGORICAL

03:39:41.935 --> 03:39:43.270
SO YOU'RE ESSENTIALLY TELLING

03:39:43.336 --> 03:39:44.704
SCHOOL DISTRICTS YOU CAN'T SPEND

03:39:44.771 --> 03:39:46.373
THIS THE MONEY THAT YOU'RE

03:39:46.439 --> 03:39:47.841
RECEIVING FROM LOTTERY FUNDS.

03:39:47.908 --> 03:39:50.010
ON ANYTHING THAT YOU PRIORITIZE

03:39:50.076 --> 03:39:51.077
TO YOUR LOCAL COMMUNITY IN YOUR

03:39:51.144 --> 03:39:52.879
EL CAP PROCESS YOU HAVE TO

03:39:52.946 --> 03:39:54.381
ACTUALLY DIVERT FUNDS IN

03:39:54.447 --> 03:39:56.583
SPECIFICALLY PUT THEM INTO THIS

03:39:56.650 --> 03:39:58.151
AREA SO WE DO OPPOSED TO AYE

03:39:58.218 --> 03:40:00.020
CATEGORICAL IS ESPECIALLY SINCE

03:40:00.086 --> 03:40:03.089
IT WOULD ELIMINATE LOCAL CONTROL --

03:40:03.156 --> 03:40:04.357
BUT EDITION ONLY WHAT YOU'RE

03:40:04.424 --> 03:40:06.893
DOING IS DIVERTING LOTTERY FUNDS

03:40:06.960 --> 03:40:11.665
I AND SO WE WE DO -- OPPOSE THAT

03:40:11.731 --> 03:40:13.099
DIRECTION WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT

03:40:13.166 --> 03:40:14.734
THE DIRECTION THAT THIS WOULD

03:40:14.801 --> 03:40:17.103
ACTUALLY SHIP LOTTERYFUNDING.

03:40:17.170 --> 03:40:19.005
WE HAVE ASKED FOR SOME EVIDENCE

03:40:19.072 --> 03:40:20.774
THAT WOULD ACTUALLY SHOW THAT IF

03:40:20.840 --> 03:40:22.642
YOU CHANGE THE PRICES OF

03:40:22.709 --> 03:40:23.877
LOTTERIES IT WOULD REDUCE AN

03:40:23.944 --> 03:40:26.246
OVERALL SYSTEMIC INCREASE IN

03:40:26.313 --> 03:40:26.813
FUNDING THAT.

03:40:26.880 --> 03:40:28.949
RECEIVED A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO

03:40:29.015 --> 03:40:31.051
IT WAS SEEN THAT EDUCATION

03:40:31.117 --> 03:40:32.953
FUNDING THROUGH LOTTERY WHICH WE

03:40:33.019 --> 03:40:33.720
KNOW IT'S A BIT SMALL DID THIS

03:40:33.787 --> 03:40:35.121
THIS IS A VERY VERY SMALL

03:40:35.188 --> 03:40:37.457
PORTION VERY VERY SMALL PORTION

03:40:37.524 --> 03:40:38.625
OF SCHOOLS BUDGETS.

03:40:38.692 --> 03:40:40.860
BUT NEVER THE LESS THERE WAS A

03:40:40.927 --> 03:40:42.796
TREND WERE A LOTTERY SALES WERE

03:40:42.862 --> 03:40:44.064
DECLINING THEREFORE IT THE

03:40:44.130 --> 03:40:45.665
REVENUE THAT WOULD GO TO SCHOOL

03:40:45.732 --> 03:40:47.200
DISTRICTS WAS DECLINING AS WELL

03:40:47.267 --> 03:40:49.102
THERE WAS AN ATTEMPT A NUMBER OF

03:40:49.169 --> 03:40:51.071
YEARS AGO. TO INCREASE THE

03:40:51.137 --> 03:40:53.206
LOTTERY PRIZES IN EVEN THOUGH

03:40:53.273 --> 03:40:54.541
SCHOOLS WOULD RECEIVE LESS

03:40:54.608 --> 03:40:56.943
OVERALL BECAUSE THERE WOULD BE

03:40:57.010 --> 03:40:58.945
MORE SALES CUMULATIVELY SCHOOLS

03:40:59.012 --> 03:41:00.614
WOULD SEE INCREASED AMOUNTS OF

03:41:00.680 --> 03:41:01.081
FUNDING.

03:41:01.147 --> 03:41:02.549
AND SO IT BEFORE IT THOSE

03:41:02.616 --> 03:41:04.884
CALCULATIONS ARE SHIFTED WE WANT

03:41:04.951 --> 03:41:06.219
TO HAVE SOME ASSURANCE THAT

03:41:06.286 --> 03:41:07.988
NUMBERS HAVE BEEN CRUNCHED AND

03:41:08.054 --> 03:41:09.422
THAT WE WOULD SEE AN OVERALL

03:41:09.489 --> 03:41:10.290
INCREASE.

03:41:10.357 --> 03:41:11.725
IN THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF FUNDS

03:41:11.791 --> 03:41:13.126
THAT ARE GOING TO EDUCATION

03:41:13.193 --> 03:41:14.928
OTHERWISE THIS IT COULD ACTUALLY

03:41:14.995 --> 03:41:17.397
LEAD TO AN OVERALL DECLINE IN

03:41:17.464 --> 03:41:19.065
THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF LOTTERY

03:41:19.132 --> 03:41:25.472
FUNDS THAT WE RECEIVED.

03:41:25.538 --> 03:41:28.208
SO THIS COULD HAVE THE ON AND

03:41:28.274 --> 03:41:30.043
CHAU IMPACT OF LOWER RANGE OF

03:41:30.110 --> 03:41:30.744
TOTAL LOTTERY FUNDS OF SCHOOL

03:41:30.810 --> 03:41:31.411
DISTRICTS GET IN THE LONG RUN SO

03:41:31.478 --> 03:41:32.579
WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT --

03:41:32.646 --> 03:41:33.480
THAT THE NUMBERS HAVE BEEN

03:41:33.546 --> 03:41:34.180
CRUNCHED IT WE'VE WE HAD AN

03:41:34.247 --> 03:41:35.782
ACTUARIAL ANALYSIS TO SHOW THE

03:41:35.849 --> 03:41:36.883
SCHOOLS WILL INDEED RECEIVE

03:41:36.950 --> 03:41:38.184
INCREASE FUNDING -- IF THAT CAN

03:41:38.251 --> 03:41:38.818
HAPPEN THAT'S A TOTALLY

03:41:38.885 --> 03:41:40.654
DIFFERENT CONVERSATION HOWEVER

03:41:40.720 --> 03:41:42.455
WE WOULD NOT SUPPORT ACTUALLY

03:41:42.522 --> 03:41:44.524
CREATING A CATEGORICAL WITH A

03:41:44.591 --> 03:41:45.992
LOTTERY FUNDS BECAUSE YOU ARE

03:41:46.059 --> 03:41:47.360
DIVERTING FUNDS.

03:41:47.427 --> 03:41:48.495
THAT WOULD HAVE OTHERWISE GONE

03:41:48.561 --> 03:41:50.563
TO SCHOOL SO WE DO APPRECIATE

03:41:50.630 --> 03:41:51.765
THE FACT THAT CENTER CHIANG IS

03:41:51.831 --> 03:41:53.199
TRYING TO HAVE A CREATIVE

03:41:53.266 --> 03:41:54.000
APPROACH.

03:41:54.067 --> 03:41:55.368
AND WE DO WE DO LIKE CREATIVE

03:41:55.435 --> 03:41:58.405
APPROACHES BUT UNFORTUNATELY WE

03:41:58.471 --> 03:41:59.939
DON'T WANT TO HAVE -- SHIFTS IN

03:42:00.006 --> 03:42:00.540
LOTTERY FUNDS AND WE

03:42:00.607 --> 03:42:03.643
UNFORTUNATELY DON'T SUPPORT

03:42:03.710 --> 03:42:05.045
CATEGORICAL.

03:42:05.111 --> 03:42:05.679
THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY OTHERS

03:42:05.745 --> 03:42:07.547
IN OPPOSITION.

03:42:07.614 --> 03:42:08.581
OUR WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE

03:42:08.648 --> 03:42:10.750
COMMITTEE CENTER PAN.

03:42:10.817 --> 03:42:12.152
I THINK THANK YOU -- SEARCHING

03:42:12.218 --> 03:42:14.154
AND I'D APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE

03:42:14.220 --> 03:42:16.122
WHAT YOU'RE TRYING -- TO ADDRESS

03:42:16.189 --> 03:42:17.691
THIS ISSUE ABOUT -- FREE EQUITY

03:42:17.757 --> 03:42:18.792
THERE SO THAT MORE STUDENTS

03:42:18.858 --> 03:42:21.394
WOULD HAVE -- EXPERIENCE WITH --

03:42:21.461 --> 03:42:23.063
CODING AND SO FORTH BUT I THINK --

03:42:23.129 --> 03:42:25.398
PROPOSED TO THE OPPOSITION'S

03:42:25.465 --> 03:42:26.700
QUESTIONS I GUESS ASIDE FROM THE

03:42:26.766 --> 03:42:28.968
CATEGORICAL ISSUE BUT IN TERMS

03:42:29.035 --> 03:42:30.370
OF THE LOTTERY FUNDING OVERALL I

03:42:30.437 --> 03:42:31.871
UNDERSTAND THAT YOU SHARED WITH

03:42:31.938 --> 03:42:34.507
ME THAT THIS IS -- IN IT THIS

03:42:34.574 --> 03:42:35.375
THIS WITHOUT DIVERT ANY EXISTING

03:42:35.442 --> 03:42:38.244
LOTTERY FUNDING FROM -- WHERE

03:42:38.311 --> 03:42:39.713
IT'S CURRENTLY GOING TO

03:42:39.779 --> 03:42:41.181
EDUCATION SO THIS IS ADDITIONAL

03:42:41.247 --> 03:42:42.315
BUT I GUESS I'D HAVE TO ASK

03:42:42.382 --> 03:42:43.183
QUESTION WE DO THIS AND

03:42:43.249 --> 03:42:44.517
INITIATIVES ALL TIME?

03:42:44.584 --> 03:42:45.752
ARE YOU WILLING TO PUT IN A BACK

03:42:45.819 --> 03:42:47.320
FILLED TO ENSURE THAT THAT

03:42:47.387 --> 03:42:49.222
AMOUNT BECAUSE OF IT ACTUALLY

03:42:49.289 --> 03:42:51.357
DOES SUPPRESS DIRECT LAW RETURNS.

03:42:51.424 --> 03:42:53.293
THAT THERE'S THAT WE PROTECT THE

03:42:53.359 --> 03:42:55.128
AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT CURRENTLY

03:42:55.195 --> 03:42:56.796
GOES EDUCATION THE LOTTERY SO

03:42:56.863 --> 03:42:57.931
WE'RE CHANGING THE FORMAL

03:42:57.997 --> 03:42:58.665
WHATEVER.

03:42:58.732 --> 03:43:00.567
WE PUT IT BACK FILL AND TO BE

03:43:00.633 --> 03:43:03.436
SURE THAT THAT THE PEOPLE WHO

03:43:03.503 --> 03:43:05.672
DEPEND FIRST OFF I GUESS THE THE

03:43:05.739 --> 03:43:07.207
THE REGIONAL FUNDS THEREFORE

03:43:07.273 --> 03:43:07.407
DON'T.

03:43:07.474 --> 03:43:11.845
KNOW SHRINK AS WE'RE TRYING TO

03:43:11.911 --> 03:43:13.246
TO I GUESS GOING TO THAT WELL

03:43:13.313 --> 03:43:15.715
FOR ANOTHER PURPOSE IS IS THAT

03:43:15.782 --> 03:43:17.183
IT IS. TO TO MEET INTENT OF WHAT

03:43:17.250 --> 03:43:18.551

03:43:18.618 --> 03:43:20.220
FUNDING COMING FROM ABSOLUTELY

03:43:20.286 --> 03:43:21.521
SO SO THE BILL JUST INCREASES

03:43:21.588 --> 03:43:23.056
THE AMOUNT THAT THE STATE

03:43:23.123 --> 03:43:25.425

YEARS OR AT LEAST AS MUCH

03:43:31.965 --> 03:43:33.900
WITHOUT LOOKING FOR TWENTY

03:43:33.967 --> 03:43:34.534
EIGHTEEN TWENTY NINETEEN FISCAL

03:43:34.601 --> 03:43:36.169
YEAR AND ALSO THIS IS JUST FOR

03:43:36.236 --> 03:43:37.504
THREE YEARS FOR THE STATE.

03:43:37.570 --> 03:43:41.174
THE SCHOOL YEARS OF 202-020-2120

03:43:41.241 --> 03:43:51.451
TWO TWENTY ONE OR TWENTY TWO

03:43:51.518 --> 03:43:52.051
TWENTY TWO TO TWENTY THREE SO

03:43:52.118 --> 03:43:54.320
IT'S IT'S IT'S IT'S NOT GOING IT

03:43:54.387 --> 03:43:55.255

TAKE FROM.

03:43:55.989 --> 03:43:56.723
THE EXISTING FUNDS AND THAT'S

03:43:56.790 --> 03:43:58.858
ALREADY A STATED IN THE BILL

OKAY ALL RIGHT WELL I I JUST AND

03:44:02.095 --> 03:44:02.562

OPPOSITION I I'M JUST ALSO

SAYING THAT.

03:44:05.131 --> 03:44:05.732
WE SHOULD THINK ABOUT IT BACK TO

03:44:05.799 --> 03:44:07.467
BILL PROVISION TO GUARANTEE THAT

03:44:07.534 --> 03:44:09.002
THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN SO IN OTHER

03:44:09.068 --> 03:44:09.435
WORDS I WILL GET.

03:44:09.502 --> 03:44:11.171
DEFINITELY OPEN TO THAT OKAY ALL

03:44:11.237 --> 03:44:12.172
RIGHT AND AND I MEAN THERE'S

03:44:12.238 --> 03:44:13.406
ANOTHER WHOLE ISSUE CATEGORICAL

03:44:13.473 --> 03:44:14.007
BUT I DO WANT THE CONVERSATION

03:44:14.073 --> 03:44:15.975

03:44:21.581 --> 03:44:22.515
BLOODY FUNNY THAT CURRENTLY GOES

03:44:22.582 --> 03:44:23.917
TO EDUCATION AND THAT WE'RE NOT

03:44:23.983 --> 03:44:25.985
CUTTING THAT'S DIMINISH BECAUSE

03:44:26.052 --> 03:44:27.020
WE GOT FEWER PEOPLE DOING THE

03:44:27.086 --> 03:44:28.421
LOTTERY OR WHATEVER ELSE AND

03:44:28.488 --> 03:44:29.956

BE SURE THAT THAT FUNDING

03:44:35.395 --> 03:44:36.429

03:45:03.590 --> 03:45:04.924
AROUND EQUITY IN LOW INCOME

03:45:04.991 --> 03:45:10.029

03:45:10.096 --> 03:45:13.833
SUCH AS THE CREDIBLE IMPORTANT --

03:45:13.900 --> 03:45:16.302
A POINT TO MAKE IN MAKING SURE

03:45:16.369 --> 03:45:18.304

MAYBE YOU CAN TALK ABOUT SOME OF

03:45:27.213 --> 03:45:27.947
THE ELEMENTS THAT ANYTHING ELSE

03:45:28.014 --> 03:45:30.016

THAT WITH THE POLICY SIDE OF IT

03:45:40.059 --> 03:45:42.228
I I THINK IT'S MY GRANDDAUGHTER

03:45:42.295 --> 03:45:42.695
JUST GOT.

03:45:42.762 --> 03:45:43.763
INTO A SHE'S TEN AND SHE JUST

03:45:43.830 --> 03:45:47.533
GOT INTO A A STEM YOU KNOW.

03:45:47.600 --> 03:45:49.035
KIND OF I GUESS THAT'S THE BEST

03:45:49.102 --> 03:45:50.603
WAY TO DESCRIBE IT AND ALL THAT --

03:45:50.670 --> 03:45:52.038
AND SHE'S REALLY EXCITED AND

03:45:52.105 --> 03:45:53.206
THAT'S THE WAY TO GO IT'S NOT

03:45:53.273 --> 03:45:55.308
JUST HOW TO USE AN IPAD BUT IT'S

03:45:55.375 --> 03:45:57.210
REALLY TO LEARN.

03:45:57.277 --> 03:45:59.512
WHAT'S INSIDE THAT COMPUTER HOW

03:45:59.579 --> 03:46:02.215
DO YOU MAKE IT WORK FOR US SO --

03:46:02.282 --> 03:46:04.250
ON THE OTHER HAND I I'M NOT YET

03:46:04.317 --> 03:46:06.386
COMFORTABLE WITH THE TAKING THE

03:46:06.452 --> 03:46:09.522
FUNDING FROM THE LOTTERY -- HOW

03:46:09.589 --> 03:46:11.024
WOULD THAT IMPACT I THINK

03:46:11.090 --> 03:46:12.625
THERE'S JUST A LOT MORE THAT I

03:46:12.692 --> 03:46:14.994
NEED TO UNDERSTAND BECAUSE I'M?

03:46:15.061 --> 03:46:16.963
I'M WORRIED.

03:46:17.030 --> 03:46:19.065
THAT WITH A THE GOOD INTENTION

03:46:19.132 --> 03:46:21.267
ON THE POLICY SIDE THAT THERE'S

03:46:21.334 --> 03:46:23.703
GONNA BE A IMPACT THAT HASN'T

03:46:23.770 --> 03:46:25.471
YET BEEN.

03:46:25.538 --> 03:46:28.007
FIGURED OUT SO -- THAT'S THE

03:46:28.074 --> 03:46:29.909
PART THAT I'M MOST CONCERNED

03:46:29.976 --> 03:46:31.678
ABOUT WHILE STILL SUPPORTING

03:46:31.744 --> 03:46:34.213
THIS AND I DO BELIEVE THAT FROM

03:46:34.280 --> 03:46:36.015
THE STATE WE HAVE TO PUSH.

03:46:36.082 --> 03:46:37.784
THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS THEY HAVE A

03:46:37.850 --> 03:46:39.953
LOT OF MANDATES THAT COST A LOT

03:46:40.019 --> 03:46:40.954
OF MONEY.

03:46:41.020 --> 03:46:42.922
BUT I DO THINK THAT WE HAVE TO

03:46:42.989 --> 03:46:44.624
PUSH THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO

03:46:44.691 --> 03:46:47.226
ADOPT OF THESE KINDS OF PROGRAMS

03:46:47.293 --> 03:46:48.194
OTHERWISE.

03:46:48.261 --> 03:46:49.662
IT'S JUST GONNA BE LEFT OUT

03:46:49.729 --> 03:46:52.265
