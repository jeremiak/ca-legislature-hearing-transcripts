A SANTA BARBARA RESIDENT AND GREAT MOVIE. I CON KIRK DOUGLAS. OF KIRK LIVED A FIN FANTASTICALLY LONG AND MEANINGFUL LIFE HE DIED RECENTLY AT THE AGE OF A HUNDRED AND THREE. OF MOST IF YOU WERE HERE WILL. REMEMBER KIRK DOUGLAS IS THE FATHER OF MICHAEL DOUGLAS BUT ACTUALLY KIRK DOUGLAS WAS AN EXTRAORDINARY STAR IN HIS OWN RIGHT IN FACT ONE OF THE LAST OF THE LEGEND OF LEADING HOLLYWOOD MEN THE BURKE LANCASTER'S THE GREGORY PECK'S- IN SO MANY OTHERS HE WAS THE LAST. TO SURVIVE THAT ERA OF THE GREAT HOLLYWOOD STAR- HE WAS BORN A VERY VERY POOR- IN A VERY VERY POOR JEWISH FAMILY IN NEW AMSTERDAM NEW YORK- HE WORKED IN OVER FORTY DIFFERENT JOBS BY THE TIME HE HAD FINISHED COLLEGE HE WENT INTO THE MILITARY AND SERVED. WAS INJURED CAME TO HOLLYWOOD AND FOUND HIS PLACE AND WAS A AN ACTOR OF COMPELLING CHARISMA OF FOR HIS DAY KNOWN FOR THAT DIMPLE IN HIS CHIN.
