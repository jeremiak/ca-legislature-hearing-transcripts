DURRELL IS AN OPIOID PRODUCT

00:49:18.722 --> 00:49:20.057
THAT WOULD INCREASE IN COST --

00:49:20.123 --> 00:49:21.925
ULTIMATELY LIVING A SIGNIFICANT

00:49:21.992 --> 00:49:23.994

THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE EPIDEMIC.

00:49:34.671 --> 00:49:36.139

HEALTHCARE SUPPLY CHAIN AND

00:49:39.242 --> 00:49:41.311
INSTEAD RAISES THE COST BASED ON

THE CURRENT DEMAND.

00:49:42.212 --> 00:49:43.613
BASIC ECONOMICS IN THE RECENT

00:49:43.680 --> 00:49:45.248
COURT DECISION OVERTURNED THE

NEW YORK Là CONCLUDED THAT COST

00:49:47.417 --> 00:49:48.518
INCREASES IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN

00:49:48.585 --> 00:49:49.986
AND SHE WILL INEVITABLY BE

00:49:50.053 --> 00:49:51.388
SHARED BY CONSUMERS.

00:49:51.455 --> 00:49:52.622

DRUGS.

00:49:56.360 --> 00:50:01.565
IT SEEMS COUNTER PRODUCTIVE TO

00:50:01.631 --> 00:50:03.200
PLACE A NOTABLE SO ON THE SAME

00:50:03.266 --> 00:50:04.368
PRODUCTS WERE TRYING TO CONTROL

00:50:04.434 --> 00:50:05.602
COSTS OF SO IT'S J. THEREFORE

ARE ACUTELY AWARE OF THE

00:50:21.351 --> 00:50:22.386
ADDICTIVE NATURE OF THESE

00:50:22.452 --> 00:50:24.621
PRODUCTS -- IS PRECISELY THESE

00:50:24.688 --> 00:50:26.757
REASONS THAT THERE IS A HIGHER

00:50:26.823 --> 00:50:28.392
LEVEL OF SCRUTINY APPLY TO THEM

00:50:28.458 --> 00:50:29.693
BY THE FDA AND THEY ARE HIGHLY

00:50:29.760 --> 00:50:32.863
REGULATED ALSO BY THE D. E. A..

00:50:32.929 --> 00:50:34.598
EIGHTY A MEMBER SUPPORT THIS

00:50:34.664 --> 00:50:37.067
OVERSIGHT [inaudible]

00:50:37.134 --> 00:50:38.802
AND AND THE RULES AND

00:50:38.869 --> 00:50:39.936
REGULATIONS THAT HIM THEY HAVE

00:50:40.003 --> 00:50:43.206
BEEN PUT IN PLACE I THINK. ONE

00:50:43.273 --> 00:50:45.008
OF THE THINGS FOR THE GENERIC

00:50:45.075 --> 00:50:46.877
MANUFACTURERS -- IS THE MARKET

00:50:46.943 --> 00:50:49.079
PLACES CHANGED SINCE THIS REALLY

00:50:49.146 --> 00:50:52.048
BECAME A CRISIS.

00:50:52.115 --> 00:50:53.049
IN WHAT.

00:50:53.116 --> 00:50:54.918
MOST OF THE LAWSUITS THAT HAVE

00:50:54.985 --> 00:50:57.387
BEEN MENTIONED -- ARE TYPICALLY

00:50:57.454 --> 00:51:02.893
THE THE PHARMACISTS THE ARMS AND

00:51:02.959 --> 00:51:03.527
THE BRAND MANY FACTORS THAT ARE

00:51:03.593 --> 00:51:04.494
NAMED.

00:51:04.561 --> 00:51:05.996
AMERICAN FACTORS NOW MAKE ABOUT

00:51:06.062 --> 00:51:09.199
ARMS ARE ABOUT 90% OF ALL THE

00:51:09.266 --> 00:51:11.368
PRESCRIPTIONS NOW OR ARE GENERIC.

00:51:11.435 --> 00:51:14.604
SO THE MARKET PLACES MOVED FROM

00:51:14.671 --> 00:51:15.939
WHAT WAS A BRAND PRODUCT.

00:51:16.006 --> 00:51:16.840
GENERIC MANUFACTURERS DON'T

00:51:16.907 --> 00:51:18.008
MARKET.

00:51:18.074 --> 00:51:20.243
THEY DID NOT DO DIRECTOR

00:51:20.310 --> 00:51:23.079
PRESCRIBER -- DETAILING.

00:51:23.146 --> 00:51:25.081
THEN IT'S TRULY THE ACCESS FOR

00:51:25.148 --> 00:51:26.516
PATIENTS WHO ARE IN NEED BECAUSE

00:51:26.583 --> 00:51:28.452
THESE ARE IMPORTANT PRODUCTS FOR

00:51:28.518 --> 00:51:30.020
MANY MANY PATIENTS.

00:51:30.086 --> 00:51:31.588
WHETHER IT'S END OF LIFE CARE

00:51:31.655 --> 00:51:35.058
CANCER -- INTRACTABLE PAIN MANY

00:51:35.125 --> 00:51:36.760
PATIENTS STILL NEED THESE.

00:51:36.827 --> 00:51:40.564
AND BECAUSE OPIATES ARE NOW A

00:51:40.630 --> 00:51:41.398
VERY.

00:51:41.465 --> 00:51:45.802
HIGH -- VERY LOW MARGIN PRODUCT

00:51:45.869 --> 00:51:49.072
BUT RELY ON A HIGH VOLUME.

00:51:49.139 --> 00:51:51.908
THE FEES THAT COULD BE CHARGED --

00:51:51.975 --> 00:51:53.610
ACCORDING TO THIS BILL ARE OFTEN

00:51:53.677 --> 00:51:54.611
GOING TO BE MORE THAN

00:51:54.678 --> 00:51:55.946
MANUFACTURERS ACTUALLY MAKE AN

00:51:56.012 --> 00:51:58.248
REVENUE ONE MANUFACTURES DURING

00:51:58.315 --> 00:52:00.317
THE NEW YORK -- CASE IT'S BEEN

00:52:00.383 --> 00:52:01.284
BEEN REFERENCED A COUPLE OF

00:52:01.351 --> 00:52:03.854
TIMES TESTIFIED THAT THE AMOUNT

00:52:03.920 --> 00:52:06.423
OF THE FEE WAS TRULY MORE THAN.

00:52:06.490 --> 00:52:07.858
THE REVENUE.

00:52:07.924 --> 00:52:09.159
WHEN THAT HAPPENS IN ANY

00:52:09.226 --> 00:52:11.661
INDUSTRY IN ANY PRODUCT?

00:52:11.728 --> 00:52:13.530
MANUFACTURER CAN NOT STAY IN

00:52:13.597 --> 00:52:14.698
BUSINESS.

00:52:14.764 --> 00:52:15.832
AND THAT'S WHAT IS GOING TO

00:52:15.899 --> 00:52:17.534
REDUCE THE ACCESS OR INCREASE

00:52:17.601 --> 00:52:20.237
THE COST FOR THOSE WHO DO REMAIN.

00:52:20.303 --> 00:52:21.371
WITHIN.

00:52:21.438 --> 00:52:23.139
THE THIS MARKET PLACE THE WAY

00:52:23.206 --> 00:52:24.808
THAT THE BILL IS STRUCTURED IF

00:52:24.875 --> 00:52:28.445
ANYONE MANUFACTURER PULLS OUT.

00:52:28.512 --> 00:52:29.613
THEN HE OTHER MANUFACTURERS

00:52:29.679 --> 00:52:30.180
THAT ARE LEFT ARE GONNA BE

00:52:30.247 --> 00:52:32.249
HIRING PAYING A HIGHER

00:52:32.315 --> 00:52:34.084
PERCENTAGE OF OF THE FEE.

00:52:34.150 --> 00:52:35.619
BECAUSE OF THOSE REASONS THAT'S

00:52:35.685 --> 00:52:37.387
WHAT'S GOING TO DRIVE EITHER THE

00:52:37.454 --> 00:52:40.190
COSTS OF WAR THE ACCESS DOWN.

00:52:40.257 --> 00:52:42.692
NOT ALL PRODUCTS ARE AVAILABLE

00:52:42.759 --> 00:52:43.460
FROM MULTIPLE MANUFACTURERS

00:52:43.527 --> 00:52:45.195
EITHER SOME OF THEM --

COSTS OF PAYING THIS FEE OR TAX.

00:52:54.971 --> 00:52:57.374
GO UP IS GOING TO BE IMPOSSIBLE

00:52:57.440 --> 00:52:58.074
FOR THOSE MANUFACTURERS TO

00:52:58.141 --> 00:53:00.510
REMAIN IN THE MARKETING

00:53:00.577 --> 00:53:01.444
CALIFORNIA.

00:53:01.511 --> 00:53:02.846
ALSO THIS IS A NATIONAL

THESE THINGS FROM A

00:56:23.913 --> 00:56:26.216
PHILOSOPHICAL PERSPECTIVE WHAT I

00:56:26.282 --> 00:56:27.050
MEAN BY THAT IS.

00:56:27.117 --> 00:56:29.686

OTHER THAT SAID DOING TO TO TO

00:56:40.430 --> 00:56:41.264
PUBLIC HEALTH.

SOCIETY.

00:56:47.003 --> 00:56:48.471

00:56:48.538 --> 00:56:50.573
IS IF IT'S NOT A TAX TO BE ABLE

00:56:50.640 --> 00:56:51.508

00:57:01.684 --> 00:57:03.086

00:57:04.988 --> 00:57:06.923
LEVEL I THINK THOSE WHO ARE

00:57:06.990 --> 00:57:08.858
PRODUCING OF THIS PRODUCT THERE

00:57:08.925 --> 00:57:10.460
IS SOME LEVEL OF RESPONSIBILITY

00:57:10.527 --> 00:57:12.996
THAT'S THERE.

00:57:13.062 --> 00:57:16.099

LIMITS ON THE PRESCRIBING -- AND

00:57:33.750 --> 00:57:35.652
THAT'S REALLY WHERE THE CONTROL

00:57:35.718 --> 00:57:38.521
OF WHERE THESE DRUGS COME FROM

00:57:38.588 --> 00:57:40.190
THE MANUFACTURERS SIMPLY FILL

00:57:40.256 --> 00:57:41.791
ORDERS [inaudible]

00:57:41.858 --> 00:57:43.793

OR PASSED THROUGH PHARMACIES.

00:57:52.468 --> 00:57:55.338
THEY ALL TAKE A PRESCRIPTION --

00:57:55.405 --> 00:57:56.873
THERE'S EDUCATION OF THE

00:57:56.940 --> 00:57:58.675
PHYSICIANS OR THE PRESCRIBER

00:57:58.741 --> 00:58:00.310

00:58:04.581 --> 00:58:07.317
HOW TO DISPOSE OF THEM PROPERLY?

00:58:07.383 --> 00:58:08.151
HELL.

00:58:08.218 --> 00:58:10.687
TO NOT TAKE THEM BEYOND WHAT

00:58:10.753 --> 00:58:12.722
THEIR PHYSICIAN ORDERS ARE --

00:58:12.789 --> 00:58:14.257
WHETHER IT'S THAT THE USE OF PDM

00:58:14.324 --> 00:58:18.561
PEAS TO STOP ANY OF THE ILLEGAL --

00:58:18.628 --> 00:58:20.163
DISTRIBUTION WHETHER IT COMES

00:58:20.230 --> 00:58:21.998
FROM THE MANUFACTURER FROM THE

00:58:22.065 --> 00:58:24.534
WHOLESALER -- BEING STOLEN FROM

00:58:24.601 --> 00:58:26.302

SO THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT

00:58:30.974 --> 00:58:33.076
STEPS OUR CONCERN AGAIN IS JUST

00:58:33.142 --> 00:58:35.211
THE WAY THAT THAT THIS FEE IS

00:58:35.278 --> 00:58:38.147
STRUCTURED NOT THAT.

00:58:38.214 --> 00:58:38.848
THERE'S NOT A PROBLEM.

00:58:38.915 --> 00:58:40.550
BUT THE WAY THAT THAT THE TAXES

00:58:40.617 --> 00:58:43.853
IS BEING DONE AND WILL FOCUS ON

00:58:43.920 --> 00:58:46.923
WE BELIEVE ON THE ON THE ON THE

MANUFACTURER'S EVEN THOUGH.

00:58:48.658 --> 00:58:49.692
AGAIN WE'RE JUST FILLING IN

00:58:49.759 --> 00:58:51.794
ORDER THAT THAT'S BASED ON A

00:58:51.861 --> 00:58:53.730
NATIONAL LEVEL SALE -- SO WE

00:58:53.796 --> 00:58:56.199

00:58:56.266 --> 00:58:57.934
THE PHARMACY THAT.

00:58:58.001 --> 00:59:01.104

00:59:01.738 --> 00:59:03.840
PILLS THEN THERE ARE PEOPLE

00:59:03.907 --> 00:59:05.909
WITHIN THE TOWN OR THE PHYSICIAN

00:59:05.975 --> 00:59:07.277
THAT'S WRITING.

00:59:07.343 --> 00:59:09.312
UP MORE SCRIPTS THAN PATIENTS IN

00:59:09.379 --> 00:59:11.781
THE REGION -- AND THOSE ARE

00:59:11.848 --> 00:59:13.816
OTHER ASPECTS THAT CAN BE DONE

00:59:13.883 --> 00:59:16.586

THROUGHOUT THE NATION REALLY --

00:59:18.254 --> 00:59:19.555
TO HELP ADDRESS THE PROBLEM BUT

00:59:19.622 --> 00:59:20.857
SIMPLY PUTTING A TAX ON A

00:59:20.924 --> 00:59:22.625
PRODUCT JUST IS GOING TO

00:59:22.692 --> 00:59:24.794
INCREASE THE COST OF THE PRODUCT

00:59:24.861 --> 00:59:26.129

01:00:33.029 --> 01:00:33.830
THAT NUMBER'S BEEN DROPPING

01:00:33.896 --> 01:00:35.798
PRETTY PRECIPITOUSLY OVER THE

01:00:35.865 --> 01:00:36.799
LAST FEW YEARS AS I RECALL IT'S

01:00:36.866 --> 01:00:38.868
ABOUT 25% LOWER THAN IT WAS A

01:00:38.935 --> 01:00:40.670
COUPLE YEARS AGO -- IT'S BUT AS

01:00:40.737 --> 01:00:42.205
FAR AS THE EXACT REVENUE NOW I

01:00:42.271 --> 01:00:45.641
DON'T KNOW -- BUT IT IS A SMALL

01:00:45.708 --> 01:00:47.076
MARGIN DRUGS -- MEANING THAT

01:00:47.143 --> 01:00:49.245
THERE'S MANY COMPETITORS MAKING

01:00:49.312 --> 01:00:50.780
THE EXACT SAME PRODUCT.

01:00:50.847 --> 01:00:51.681
OKAY.

01:00:51.748 --> 01:00:53.583
NOT NOT NECESSARILY YOUR GROUP

01:00:53.649 --> 01:00:55.618
OF THE ASSOCIATION MEMBERS BUT

01:00:55.685 --> 01:00:58.254
AS A WHOLE THE INDUSTRY IS

01:00:58.321 --> 01:01:03.426
MAKING AND HAS MADE BILLIONS OF

01:01:03.493 --> 01:01:07.363
DOLLARS IS THAT CORRECT -- I I I

01:01:07.430 --> 01:01:08.364
CAN'T ANSWER THAT WITH ENOUGH

01:01:08.431 --> 01:01:09.632
CLARITY -- YOU KNOW WE CAN LOOK

01:01:09.699 --> 01:01:10.666
INTO IT BUT I I THINK I WOULD GO

01:01:10.733 --> 01:01:11.467
BACK TO MY COMMENTS EARLIER THAT

01:01:11.534 --> 01:01:12.769
THE MARKET PLACES CHANGE PRETTY

01:01:12.835 --> 01:01:14.270
PRECIPITOUSLY.

01:01:14.337 --> 01:01:16.339
SINCE THE BRANDS -- HAVE LOST

01:01:16.406 --> 01:01:17.874
PATENT PROTECTION AND IT HAS

01:01:17.940 --> 01:01:19.776
BECOME PRIMARILY A GENERIC

01:01:19.842 --> 01:01:21.978
PRODUCT.

01:01:22.045 --> 01:01:24.280
OKAY AND THAT WAS TO MY PROFIT

01:01:24.347 --> 01:01:25.014
SIDE OF THE QUESTION.

01:01:25.081 --> 01:01:26.182
DON'T ASK MUCH ABOUT THAT THE

01:01:26.249 --> 01:01:28.217
COST SO THEY WE ALL KNOW THAT.

01:01:28.284 --> 01:01:30.119
THE OPIOID EPIDEMIC IS EXACT IS

01:01:30.186 --> 01:01:32.722
AT EXACT TEAM.

01:01:32.789 --> 01:01:34.057
TREMENDOUS HUMAN CALL.

01:01:34.123 --> 01:01:35.258
AND WOULD YOU ALSO AGREE THAT IT

01:01:35.324 --> 01:01:36.592
IS EXACTING A TREMENDOUS

01:01:36.659 --> 01:01:37.894
FINANCIAL TOLL.

01:01:37.960 --> 01:01:40.063
ON CALIFORNIAN CALIFORNIA'S

01:01:40.129 --> 01:01:41.831
ECONOMY.

01:01:41.898 --> 01:01:43.199
YEAH I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY

01:01:43.266 --> 01:01:45.234
DISCREPANCY ON THAT -- I THINK

01:01:45.301 --> 01:01:46.903
PART OF THE QUESTION THOUGH IT

01:01:46.969 --> 01:01:48.371
REMAINS AND I THINK THE SHERIFF

01:01:48.438 --> 01:01:50.006
ACTUALLY BROUGHT IT UP THE FACT

01:01:50.073 --> 01:01:52.175
THAT THE USE OF OF ILLEGAL

01:01:52.241 --> 01:01:53.276
FENNEL.

01:01:53.342 --> 01:01:56.212
AND NOT FROM PRESCRIBED DRUGS IS

01:01:56.279 --> 01:01:57.814
ON THE RISE AND THAT IS ONE OF

01:01:57.880 --> 01:01:59.215
THE MAIN AREAS THAT I THINK

01:01:59.282 --> 01:02:00.583
NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED IN THIS

01:02:00.650 --> 01:02:02.585
BILL WILL DO NOTHING. TO ADDRESS

01:02:02.652 --> 01:02:05.154
THE INCREASED USE OF OF FENNEL

01:02:05.221 --> 01:02:07.223
THAT IS NOT COMING THROUGH THE

01:02:07.290 --> 01:02:08.558
NORMAL DISTRIBUTION CHANNEL

01:02:08.624 --> 01:02:11.127
THERE HAVE BEEN LAWSUITS -- AND

01:02:11.194 --> 01:02:12.628
THOSE IN ON OUR VIEW SHOULD

01:02:12.695 --> 01:02:15.131
CONTINUE -- WHETHER IT'S AGAINST

01:02:15.198 --> 01:02:17.467
THE PILL MILLS THE PHYSICIANS

01:02:17.533 --> 01:02:20.470
WHO ARE OVER PRESCRIBING OR IF

01:02:20.536 --> 01:02:22.405
THERE ARE MANUFACTURERS THAT OR

01:02:22.472 --> 01:02:24.574
OR DISTRIBUTING THEM THAT'S THE

01:02:24.640 --> 01:02:26.275
APPROPRIATE VENUE BUT AGAIN I

01:02:26.342 --> 01:02:27.877
DON'T THINK THAT.

01:02:27.944 --> 01:02:29.612
TAXING THIS PRODUCT IS REALLY

01:02:29.679 --> 01:02:31.781
GOING TO END UP REDUCING THE

01:02:31.848 --> 01:02:34.984
AMOUNT OF DRUGS THAT IS COMING

01:02:35.051 --> 01:02:35.918
THROUGH THE LEGAL.

01:02:35.985 --> 01:02:37.353
PRESCRIPTION SUPPLY CHAIN.

01:02:37.420 --> 01:02:38.287
BUT I THINK I AGREE WITH YOU

01:02:38.354 --> 01:02:39.689
THAT THERE'S THERE'S MUCH THAT

01:02:39.755 --> 01:02:41.724
NEEDS TO BE DONE THE SPACING I

01:02:41.791 --> 01:02:42.358
THINK.

01:02:42.425 --> 01:02:44.393
THE OBJECT OF THIS SPELL IS TO

01:02:44.460 --> 01:02:46.762
RAISE SOME RESOURCES TO FIND

01:02:46.829 --> 01:02:49.098
DESPERATELY NEEDED TREATMENTS --

01:02:49.165 --> 01:02:49.932
CONSERVE GETTING BACK TO MY

01:02:49.999 --> 01:02:51.200
QUESTION THINK THE ANSWER IS IT

01:02:51.267 --> 01:02:52.401
IS IT'S IT'S COSTING

01:02:52.468 --> 01:02:54.871
CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY BILLIONS OF

01:02:54.937 --> 01:02:55.805
DOLLARS.

01:02:55.872 --> 01:02:57.673
AND I THINK TO THE AUTHOR'S

01:02:57.740 --> 01:02:58.708
POINT.

01:02:58.774 --> 01:03:01.410
IT'S REGULAR TAXPAYERS IT'S IT'S

01:03:01.477 --> 01:03:02.478
OUR CONSTITUENTS.

01:03:02.545 --> 01:03:04.080
YOU KNOW ALL ACROSS THE STATE WE

01:03:04.147 --> 01:03:05.715
ARE THE ONES THAT ARE PICKING UP

01:03:05.781 --> 01:03:07.250
THE TAB.

01:03:07.316 --> 01:03:08.851
AND YOU KNOW I THINK.

01:03:08.918 --> 01:03:10.486
MY COLLEAGUES TO THE RIGHT RAISE

01:03:10.553 --> 01:03:12.121
THE QUESTION ABOUT KIND OF THE

01:03:12.188 --> 01:03:13.322
PHILOSOPHICAL APPROACH AND THAT

01:03:13.389 --> 01:03:14.757
THIS IS BEEN A TOUGH ONE FOR ME

01:03:14.824 --> 01:03:16.926
AS WELL SO I'M PRO BUSINESS AND

01:03:16.993 --> 01:03:18.127
PRO TAX PAYER.

01:03:18.194 --> 01:03:19.695
I LOOK VERY CLOSELY AT THE IDEA

01:03:19.762 --> 01:03:21.197
OF ANY ADDITIONAL FEE BUT I

01:03:21.264 --> 01:03:22.198
THINK.

01:03:22.265 --> 01:03:24.800
THAT I'M WHEN I LOOK AT THE THE

01:03:24.867 --> 01:03:28.104
TOLL THAT IS BEING EXACTED --

01:03:28.171 --> 01:03:29.238
ALL ACROSS.

01:03:29.305 --> 01:03:30.573
YOU KNOW MY COMMUNITY ALL ACROSS

01:03:30.640 --> 01:03:31.774
THE STATE.

01:03:31.841 --> 01:03:33.276
AND IT FEELS TO ME LIKE.

01:03:33.342 --> 01:03:35.578
MY TAXPAYERS OF MY CONSTITUENTS

01:03:35.645 --> 01:03:36.245
ARE THE ONLY ONES WERE REPAIRING

01:03:36.312 --> 01:03:37.880
THE BIRD AND I DO FEEL LIKE THE

01:03:37.947 --> 01:03:38.948
INDUSTRY.

01:03:39.015 --> 01:03:41.217
NEEDS TO STEP UP AND THAT'S NOT

01:03:41.284 --> 01:03:43.119
TO SAY THAT EVERYONE.

01:03:43.186 --> 01:03:45.421
IN THE INDUSTRY IS IN A BEEN A

01:03:45.488 --> 01:03:47.857
BAD ACTOR BUT NO.

01:03:47.924 --> 01:03:48.791
WHETHER IT'S BEEN THROUGH

01:03:48.858 --> 01:03:52.094
HAPPENSTANCE OR OR OR SOMETHING

01:03:52.161 --> 01:03:53.429
YOU KNOW MORE NEFARIOUS.

01:03:53.496 --> 01:03:54.931
THERE HAS BEEN A CRISIS IT'S

01:03:54.997 --> 01:03:56.532
BEEN CREATED AND I I DO THINK

01:03:56.599 --> 01:03:58.668
THAT THE INDUSTRY NEEDS TO COME

01:03:58.734 --> 01:04:01.504
TO THE TABLE INTERNIST AND I'VE

01:04:01.571 --> 01:04:02.138
FOR THAT REASON YOU KNOW I DON'T

01:04:02.205 --> 01:04:02.772
THINK THIS.

01:04:02.838 --> 01:04:03.639
IT'S A PERFECT PIECE OF

01:04:03.706 --> 01:04:04.373
LEGISLATION BUT I WILL BE

01:04:04.440 --> 01:04:07.476
SUPPORTING IT TODAY AND HAVE NO

01:04:07.543 --> 01:04:08.945
ONE TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT WE

01:04:09.011 --> 01:04:09.612
CAN MOVE THIS FORWARD SO THAT WE

01:04:09.679 --> 01:04:10.413
CAN.

01:04:10.479 --> 01:04:11.414
CAN HAVE A SERIOUS CONVERSATION

01:04:11.480 --> 01:04:13.082
AT ALL THE THINGS THAT NEED TO

01:04:13.149 --> 01:04:14.517
BE DONE BECAUSE THE BOTTOM LINE

01:04:14.584 --> 01:04:15.785
IS EVERYTHING YOU TALKED ABOUT.

01:04:15.851 --> 01:04:17.486
IN A BETTER EDUCATION BETTER

01:04:17.553 --> 01:04:18.621
ENFORCEMENT.

01:04:18.688 --> 01:04:20.523
THAT STUFF COSTS MONEY AND RIGHT

01:04:20.590 --> 01:04:22.225
NOW CALIFORNIA TAXPAYERS ARE THE

01:04:22.291 --> 01:04:23.125
ONES HE'S PAYING FOR IT AND WE

01:04:23.192 --> 01:04:23.859
NEED.

01:04:23.926 --> 01:04:25.628
WE NEED HELP TO GET THIS GET

01:04:25.695 --> 01:04:29.365
THIS DONE [inaudible]

01:04:29.432 --> 01:04:31.500
MR GREAT.

01:04:31.567 --> 01:04:33.236
THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR.

01:04:33.302 --> 01:04:35.104
AND THANK YOU TO THE MEMBERS OR

01:04:35.171 --> 01:04:36.872
BRING IN FORWARD.

01:04:36.939 --> 01:04:40.209
AN INTERESTING TOPIC AND I'LL

01:04:40.276 --> 01:04:41.777
CERTAINLY GIVE YOU ACCOLADES FOR

01:04:41.844 --> 01:04:44.013
THE BOTH OF YOU HAVE -- LOBBIED

01:04:44.080 --> 01:04:45.548
ME HEAVILY.

01:04:45.615 --> 01:04:47.216
ON THIS BILL AND MADE -- BEEN

01:04:47.283 --> 01:04:50.586
GOOD ADVOCATES FOR YOUR ISSUE --

01:04:50.653 --> 01:04:51.520
THERE'S A WHOLE BUNCH I WANT TO

01:04:51.587 --> 01:04:54.757
COVER HONESTLY -- YOUR WHATEVER

01:04:54.824 --> 01:04:56.792
LOOK AT BILL IT'S KIND OF THE

01:04:56.859 --> 01:04:58.160
THREE BASIC TENETS LIKE IS THERE

01:04:58.227 --> 01:05:00.329
A PROBLEM.

01:05:00.396 --> 01:05:01.964
I THINK WE CAN EASILY ANSWER

01:05:02.031 --> 01:05:03.866
THAT QUESTION -- IN THIS CASE IS

01:05:03.933 --> 01:05:05.801
A HUGE PROBLEM.

01:05:05.868 --> 01:05:06.402
IS A PROBLEM GOVERNMENT COULD

01:05:06.469 --> 01:05:08.604
SOLVE.

01:05:08.671 --> 01:05:09.205
CERTAINLY I THINK GOVERNMENT'S

01:05:09.272 --> 01:05:10.973
ROLE.

01:05:11.040 --> 01:05:12.541
DOES THE BILL PROPOSED HAVE ANY

01:05:12.608 --> 01:05:14.310
OF THOSE SOLUTIONS ANDRIGHT

01:05:14.377 --> 01:05:15.344
THAT'S THE THIRD QUESTION

01:05:15.411 --> 01:05:15.645
[inaudible]

01:05:15.711 --> 01:05:20.182
AND YOUR STRIKES ME.

01:05:20.249 --> 01:05:22.418
IT MAY THIS COULD BE A PIECE OF

01:05:22.485 --> 01:05:23.219
THE PROBLEM I CERTAINLY DON'T

01:05:23.286 --> 01:05:26.656
THINK THIS IS THE ENTIRE PUZZLE.

01:05:26.722 --> 01:05:27.957
FOR NINETEEN YEARS THAT I'VE

01:05:28.024 --> 01:05:29.992
BEEN AROUND THIS INSTITUTION.

01:05:30.059 --> 01:05:32.795
ALL OF THE STAKEHOLDERS WITHIN

01:05:32.862 --> 01:05:35.164
THE HEALTHCARE INDUSTRY.

01:05:35.231 --> 01:05:37.533
SHOW UP IN A TO SOME DEGREE CRY

01:05:37.600 --> 01:05:38.134
POOR MOUTH.

01:05:38.200 --> 01:05:39.302
I SAW YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE

01:05:39.368 --> 01:05:40.569
ALMOST BROKE OTHER THAN THE

01:05:40.636 --> 01:05:43.272
PHARMACOGNOSY SAY WERE MAKING

01:05:43.339 --> 01:05:43.873
LOTS OF MONEY BUT WE NEED FOR

01:05:43.939 --> 01:05:45.941
OUR DE.

01:05:46.008 --> 01:05:46.876
EVERYBODY ELSE IS GOING BROKE

01:05:46.942 --> 01:05:47.443
MEANWHILE WE SPEND MORE ON

01:05:47.510 --> 01:05:49.045
HEALTH CARE PER CAPITA THAN MOST

01:05:49.111 --> 01:05:53.316
OTHER COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD.

01:05:53.382 --> 01:05:56.686
WHEN WE VOTED LAST YEAR?

01:05:56.752 --> 01:05:58.587
ON SB SEVENTY IN THE THE

01:05:58.654 --> 01:06:00.323

OUR ARGUE THE MUCH THE GREATEST

01:06:09.965 --> 01:06:11.701
THREATS AFFORDABLE HEALTHCARE IS

01:06:11.767 --> 01:06:13.703
THE FIRM'S CORNISH PRICING OF

NEW AND EXISTING MEDICATION --

01:06:16.105 --> 01:06:17.940
LEADING TO HIGHER COSTS --

RISING PRESCRIPTION DRUGS HAVE

01:06:20.676 --> 01:06:22.211
BEEN SIZE A MAJOR DRIVER OF

COST DRIVER AND THE WHAT WE

I CAN ANSWER THAT QUESTION.

01:07:02.151 --> 01:07:03.252
SOME OF THE CLINICS OTHER

01:07:03.319 --> 01:07:04.120
PROVIDERS CAN TELL YOU BUT I I

01:07:04.186 --> 01:07:06.922
WILL SAY THAT. FOR FOR THE COST

01:07:06.989 --> 01:07:07.957
IF YOU'RE GETTING A PAIN CLING

01:07:08.023 --> 01:07:10.226
THAT SICK PRETTY CLEAR. 195% OF

01:07:10.292 --> 01:07:12.261
PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA AFTER THE

01:07:12.328 --> 01:07:13.829
FOUR WHEEL CARE ACT.

PROVIDERS AS YOU KNOW.

01:07:18.300 --> 01:07:20.369
BUT WHEN THEY GET A PRESCRIPTION

01:07:20.436 --> 01:07:22.004
THEY HAVE A COPAY SO TO

01:07:22.071 --> 01:07:23.806
TRADITIONAL COPAY TWENTY BUCKS

01:07:23.873 --> 01:07:25.341
SO 95% OF PEOPLE.

01:07:25.408 --> 01:07:27.042
WHO ARE UTILIZING THAT MENTIONED

01:07:27.109 --> 01:07:28.244
EARLIER?

01:07:28.310 --> 01:07:30.045
A MOM WHO GOES IN FOR LABOR

01:07:30.112 --> 01:07:32.148
DELIVERY CELL 95% OF PEOPLE IN

01:07:32.214 --> 01:07:33.516
THAT SITUATION ARE GOING TO BE

01:07:33.582 --> 01:07:34.550
ABLE TO HAVE.

01:07:34.617 --> 01:07:36.352
THEIR THEIR THEIR MEDICINE

AND WE BORN WITHIN THE COPAY AND

01:07:40.456 --> 01:07:42.358
I WILL NOTE THAT A LOT OF TALK

01:07:42.425 --> 01:07:44.960
TODAY ABOUT PASSED THROUGH.

01:07:45.027 --> 01:07:48.297
THE PEOPLE THAT.

01:07:48.364 --> 01:07:50.266
THERE ARE IT IN INTO THE ROAD OF

01:07:50.332 --> 01:07:50.866
THAT COAT THERE THE INSURANCE

01:07:50.933 --> 01:07:51.100
FOLKS.

01:07:51.167 --> 01:07:51.600
AND THEY'RE NOT HERE IN

01:07:51.667 --> 01:07:53.002
OPPOSITION SO THIS REALLY IS I

01:07:53.068 --> 01:07:54.570

ARGUED SOME PEOPLE OPPOSE

01:07:55.938 --> 01:07:57.773

CALIFORNIA TO PAY FOR THIS

01:08:14.924 --> 01:08:15.591
CRISIS.

01:08:15.658 --> 01:08:18.461
THE AGENCY RESPONSE I'D I DON'T.

01:08:21.363 --> 01:08:23.833
I REALIZE THAT FORMA AND KIND OF

01:08:23.899 --> 01:08:25.634

BOGEYMAN IN POLITICS.

01:08:29.104 --> 01:08:31.474
BUT THE PROBLEM SEEMS FAR MORE

01:08:31.540 --> 01:08:32.942

OVERSIGHT WE BEING THE

01:08:48.224 --> 01:08:50.092
LEGISLATURE -- THIS COMMITTEE

COMEDIAN HOUSES BUT IN THIS.

01:08:58.767 --> 01:08:59.301
TWENTY FIFTEEN TWENTY SIXTEEN

01:08:59.368 --> 01:09:00.836
REPORTER THE STATE UNDER SAYING

01:09:00.903 --> 01:09:01.470
THAT.

01:09:01.537 --> 01:09:03.939
WE ARE WE'VE GOT FUNDS AT DID

COUNTIES WERE WERE SITTING ON

01:09:06.575 --> 01:09:10.513
THE COUNTIES ARE SET ON TO EARN

01:09:10.579 --> 01:09:12.781
THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS.

01:09:12.848 --> 01:09:13.415
WELL AND SO THAT WOULD ESTABLISH

01:09:13.482 --> 01:09:14.750
ANOTHER FUN FOR ANOTHER HUNDRED

01:09:14.817 --> 01:09:15.384
MILLION WE'RE GONNA MAKE SURE

01:09:15.451 --> 01:09:16.051
THAT'S THAT AND THEN WE'RE GOING

01:09:16.118 --> 01:09:16.952
TO SAY THAT WE'RE GOING TO

01:09:17.019 --> 01:09:18.087
PROVIDE COVERAGE AND CARE.

01:09:18.153 --> 01:09:18.754
UNLESS MAYBE YOU LIVE IN A RURAL

01:09:18.821 --> 01:09:19.855
YOU KNOW PART OF THE STATE WHERE

01:09:19.922 --> 01:09:21.190
THERE'S NOT THE PROVIDERS THE

01:09:21.257 --> 01:09:23.792
PROGRAMS RIGHT -- AND HOW ARE WE

01:09:23.859 --> 01:09:25.461
INSURING AGAIN THAT ALL THE

01:09:25.528 --> 01:09:26.629
STAKEHOLDERS HAVE A SEAT AT THE

01:09:26.695 --> 01:09:27.997
TABLE I UNDERSTAND THE BILL HOW

01:09:28.063 --> 01:09:29.832
WE'RE ENSURING THAT -- THAT

01:09:29.899 --> 01:09:31.000
FOREIGN COUNTRIES HAVE SU TABLE

01:09:31.066 --> 01:09:32.301
AND FRANKLY I THINK THAT MAY BE

01:09:32.368 --> 01:09:34.203
AN IMPORTANT STEP FORWARD BUT I

01:09:34.270 --> 01:09:36.005
CERTAINLY DON'T THINK WE'VE GOT

01:09:36.071 --> 01:09:37.273
OUR ARMS AROUND THE ENTIRE THE

01:09:37.339 --> 01:09:39.441
PROBLEM OR THE ENTIRETY OF THE

01:09:39.508 --> 01:09:40.676
FOLKS THAT I TO BE AT THE TABLE.

01:09:40.743 --> 01:09:44.547
AND ALSO BECAUSE WE KEEP DEALING

01:09:44.613 --> 01:09:45.915
WITH THESE ISSUES IN SILOS.

01:09:45.981 --> 01:09:46.882
RATHER SIT DOWN AND PUT IN A

01:09:46.949 --> 01:09:48.083
REAL PACKAGE OF REFORM TOGETHER

01:09:48.150 --> 01:09:49.084
THAT KIND OF HOLDS EVERYBODY

01:09:49.151 --> 01:09:50.619
SPEAK TO THE FIRE JUST DOESN'T

01:09:50.686 --> 01:09:52.988
STRIKE ME AS THE RIGHT APPROACH

01:09:53.055 --> 01:09:55.157
IT WHAT'S YOUR RESPONSE THERE.

01:09:55.224 --> 01:09:57.059
WHICH ALSO YEAH GOOD JUST HOW WE

01:09:57.126 --> 01:09:57.626
AMENDED IT AND THEN I WENT

01:09:57.693 --> 01:09:58.928
MISTER GALLAGHER TALK ABOUT THE

01:09:58.994 --> 01:09:59.295
IMPACT ON REAL.

01:09:59.361 --> 01:10:01.063
IS THAT WE HAD CONCERNS LIKE YOU

01:10:01.130 --> 01:10:02.398
IF YOU LOOK AT THE MENTAL HEALTH

01:10:02.464 --> 01:10:04.099
ACT THESE COUNTIES ARE SITTING

01:10:04.166 --> 01:10:05.434
ON MONEY SO WE DIDN'T WANT THE

01:10:05.501 --> 01:10:07.102
MONEY GOING OUT AS A PRIOR

01:10:07.169 --> 01:10:08.470
VERSION JUST TO COUNTIES BECAUSE

01:10:08.537 --> 01:10:10.072
THEY MAY JUST DO THAT.

01:10:10.139 --> 01:10:12.007
WE BROUGHT UP NOW SO -- CLINICS

01:10:12.074 --> 01:10:14.043
IN PROVIDERS IN YOUR COMMUNITIES

01:10:14.109 --> 01:10:16.879
CAN DIRECTLY APPLY FOR IT -- IN

01:10:16.946 --> 01:10:19.949
ADDITION TO COUNTY SEAT LIKE TO

01:10:20.015 --> 01:10:21.984
PARTICIPATE -- SO THERE WAS A

01:10:22.051 --> 01:10:22.751
LOT IN THERE BUT I'VE BEEN JUST

01:10:22.818 --> 01:10:23.752
A COUPLE THINGS THAT I WOULD

01:10:23.819 --> 01:10:27.890
RESPOND TO IS -- ONE IT WHAT HAS

01:10:27.957 --> 01:10:29.091
HELPED GET OUT INTO THE RURAL

01:10:29.158 --> 01:10:30.960
AREAS IS THIS HUB AND SPOKE

01:10:31.026 --> 01:10:31.627
MODEL THAT.

01:10:31.694 --> 01:10:33.829
I WAS REALLY STARTED TO FEDERAL

01:10:33.896 --> 01:10:36.332
FUNDS -- THAT IS HELPING GET

01:10:36.398 --> 01:10:38.067
BASICALLY SUPPORT CLINICS GOING

01:10:38.133 --> 01:10:40.169
INTO GOING OUT INTO A RULER AND

01:10:40.235 --> 01:10:41.604
THEN STE AND THEN ESSENTIALLY

01:10:41.670 --> 01:10:45.441
SPOKE IN OFF OF THE HUB SO --

01:10:45.507 --> 01:10:46.642
FOR EXAMPLE AGES WHICH IS OF A

01:10:46.709 --> 01:10:48.644
PRIVATE COMPANY BUT IS IN THIS

01:10:48.711 --> 01:10:51.380
SPACE SAYS USE THOSE FUNDS. TO

01:10:51.447 --> 01:10:53.983
ESTABLISH -- CLINICS IN RED

01:10:54.049 --> 01:10:55.284
BLUFF YOU KNOW MY DISTRICT --

01:10:55.351 --> 01:10:56.518
AND IS HOPING TO USE THAT

01:10:56.585 --> 01:10:58.354
CONTINUE THAT HUB AND SPOKE

01:10:58.420 --> 01:11:00.055
MODEL TO CONTINUE TO GET IT OUT.

01:11:00.122 --> 01:11:02.324
AND TO ALL THE AREAS -- BUT THAT

01:11:02.391 --> 01:11:04.593
MONEY IS IS DWINDLING AWAY IT'S

01:11:04.660 --> 01:11:05.995
NOT GONNA BE HERE LONG TERM WE

01:11:06.061 --> 01:11:07.262
DO NEED TO HAVE A CONTINUOUS

01:11:07.329 --> 01:11:08.764
SOURCE OF FUNDING AND SO I SEE

01:11:08.831 --> 01:11:10.032
THIS.

01:11:10.099 --> 01:11:12.968
AS A WAY TO DO THAT -- AND I

01:11:13.035 --> 01:11:14.169
AGREE LIKE THIS ISN'T THE ONLY

01:11:14.236 --> 01:11:18.107
SOLUTION BUT YOU KNOW WE TALKED

01:11:18.173 --> 01:11:18.741
ABOUT THE THINGS THAT ARE BEING

01:11:18.807 --> 01:11:19.708
DONE.

01:11:19.775 --> 01:11:20.909
YOU KNOW LIMITING THE AMOUNT OF

01:11:20.976 --> 01:11:22.611
PILLS -- HAVING DRUG TAKE BACK

01:11:22.678 --> 01:11:23.379
PROGRAMS ALL THESE THINGS ARE

01:11:23.445 --> 01:11:24.513
GOOD.

01:11:24.580 --> 01:11:25.748
RIGHT BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS THE

01:11:25.814 --> 01:11:27.149
DAMAGE IS ALREADY DONE PEOPLE

01:11:27.216 --> 01:11:28.450
ARE ALREADY ADDICTED TO THIS

01:11:28.517 --> 01:11:29.518
STUFF OKAY SO THAT THAT KIND OF

01:11:29.585 --> 01:11:31.320
HELPS.

01:11:31.387 --> 01:11:32.621
YOU KNOW KINDA HEAD YOU KNOW

01:11:32.688 --> 01:11:35.190
HEADS THE IS A TOURNIQUET READ

01:11:35.257 --> 01:11:36.492
IT KIND OF KEEPS IT FROM

01:11:36.558 --> 01:11:37.860
SPREADING MORE.

01:11:37.926 --> 01:11:39.395
BUT THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS WE

01:11:39.461 --> 01:11:40.496
HAVE SO MANY PEOPLE WHO ALREADY

01:11:40.562 --> 01:11:41.997
ADDICTED THE ONLY WAY TO REALLY

01:11:42.064 --> 01:11:44.233
DEAL WITH US TO GET THEM OFF OF

01:11:44.299 --> 01:11:45.434
YOU KNOW NOT ADDICTED ANYMORE

01:11:45.501 --> 01:11:47.136
RIGHT WHICH IS A MORE EXPENSIVE

01:11:47.202 --> 01:11:49.438
PROBLEM -- AND THAT'S WHERE THIS

01:11:49.505 --> 01:11:51.073
FUNDING AND TRYING TO GET MORE

01:11:51.140 --> 01:11:52.775
MORE THESE TREATMENT TREATMENTS

01:11:52.841 --> 01:11:53.809
AVAILABLE MAKE THEM MORE

01:11:53.876 --> 01:11:55.344
WIDESPREAD.

01:11:55.411 --> 01:11:56.812
HIS CELL PHONE TO THIS POINT THE

01:11:56.879 --> 01:11:58.147
OTHER PEOPLE THAT.

01:11:58.213 --> 01:11:58.914
YOU KNOW WE HAVE DEALT WITH

01:11:58.981 --> 01:12:00.816
DOCTORS AND PRESCRIBING WE HAVE

01:12:00.883 --> 01:12:01.450
DEALT WITH A LOT OF THESE OTHER

01:12:01.517 --> 01:12:02.484
AREAS.

01:12:02.551 --> 01:12:03.519
THE GROUP THAT HASN'T REALLY

01:12:03.585 --> 01:12:05.454
DONE MUCH ON THIS IS THE

01:12:05.521 --> 01:12:06.989
PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY THAT

01:12:07.056 --> 01:12:09.091
MANUFACTURES AND SO. TO ME AND

01:12:09.158 --> 01:12:10.592
SAYING HEY YOU KNOW THE PUBLIC'S

01:12:10.659 --> 01:12:12.061
DOING A LOT THE LOCALS ARE DOING

01:12:12.127 --> 01:12:15.664
A LOT -- PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS

01:12:15.731 --> 01:12:17.032
ARE DOING A LOT.

01:12:17.099 --> 01:12:18.500
HOW ABOUT YOU GUYS DO A LITTLE

01:12:18.567 --> 01:12:20.502
BIT ON THIS AS WELL RISING

01:12:20.569 --> 01:12:21.403
HEALTHCARE COSTS ARE A HUGE

01:12:21.470 --> 01:12:22.705
ISSUE AND IT'S PROBABLY BIGGER

01:12:22.771 --> 01:12:23.739
THAN JUST THIS DISCUSSION RIGHT

01:12:23.806 --> 01:12:25.140
HERE?

01:12:25.207 --> 01:12:27.609
BUT WHAT I SEE IS THAT

01:12:27.676 --> 01:12:28.210
THROUGHOUT THE INDUSTRY WERE

01:12:28.277 --> 01:12:29.178
LIMITING.

01:12:29.244 --> 01:12:30.279
AND YOU KNOW WE'RE LIMIT HOW

01:12:30.345 --> 01:12:32.181
MUCH YOU CAN REIMBURSE THAT MEDI

01:12:32.247 --> 01:12:34.550
CAL ALL THOSE THINGS RIGHT WE'RE

01:12:34.616 --> 01:12:35.884
WE'RE LIMóN A LOT OF THINGS

01:12:35.951 --> 01:12:37.219
WE'RE NOT REALLY LIMITING WHAT

01:12:37.286 --> 01:12:38.687
YOU CAN CHARGE FOR PRESCRIPTION

01:12:38.754 --> 01:12:40.189
DRUGS.

01:12:40.255 --> 01:12:42.591
LAST I CHECKED -- SO.

01:12:42.658 --> 01:12:44.693
YOU KNOW IT IN THAT SPACE AND A

01:12:44.760 --> 01:12:46.061
AND AND I'M NOT SAYING THAT.

01:12:46.128 --> 01:12:47.930
NESTLE SHOULD GET INTO THAT

01:12:47.996 --> 01:12:50.399
RIGHT BUT YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT

01:12:50.466 --> 01:12:51.967
GOING IN THERE AND TELLING THEM

01:12:52.034 --> 01:12:53.302
WHAT THEY CAN CHARGE.

01:12:53.368 --> 01:12:54.703
THAT SET SEVENTEEN WAS PURELY A

01:12:54.770 --> 01:12:56.338
TRANSPARENCY BILL IF YOU'RE

01:12:56.405 --> 01:12:58.207
GOING TO RAISE THE PRICE.

01:12:58.273 --> 01:13:00.109
YEAH BUT MORE THAN 16% THEN HEY

01:13:00.175 --> 01:13:01.143
YOU SHOULD PROBABLY TELL

01:13:01.210 --> 01:13:01.777
EVERYBODY THAT YOU'RE GOING TO

01:13:01.844 --> 01:13:03.445
DO THAT RIGHT -- SO THEY CAN

01:13:03.512 --> 01:13:05.581
PREPARE FOR THOSE INCREASING

01:13:05.647 --> 01:13:08.650
COSTS -- BUT THAT'S THE THE

01:13:08.717 --> 01:13:11.320
RISING HEALTHCARE COSTS THAT

01:13:11.386 --> 01:13:12.755
ISSUE IS.

01:13:12.821 --> 01:13:14.189
IS NOT JUST.

01:13:14.256 --> 01:13:14.823
NO THAT'S NOT GONNA BE IMPACTED

01:13:14.890 --> 01:13:15.958
BY THIS BILL RIGHT HERE.

01:13:16.024 --> 01:13:17.826
IT'S IMPACTED BY A WHOLE HOST OF

01:13:17.893 --> 01:13:19.495
OTHER FACTORS.

01:13:19.561 --> 01:13:22.598
THAT WE NEED TO DEAL WITH RIGHT --

01:13:22.664 --> 01:13:23.966
AND SO.

01:13:24.032 --> 01:13:25.434
YOU KNOW I WOULDN'T TAG.

01:13:25.501 --> 01:13:27.202
THAT WHOLE PROBLEM ON ON THIS

01:13:27.269 --> 01:13:29.004
ONE BILL WHERE ARE YOU KNOW AS

01:13:29.071 --> 01:13:30.005
HE SAID A LOT OF EVERYBODY'S IN

01:13:30.072 --> 01:13:31.173
YEARS IN THE CAT THE COST IS

01:13:31.240 --> 01:13:32.975
GOING TO GET PASSED ON TO US OR

01:13:33.041 --> 01:13:34.443
TO US OR TO WHICH ONE IS IT.

01:13:34.510 --> 01:13:36.245
YOU KNOW I THINK THE REALITY IS

01:13:36.311 --> 01:13:37.513
INSURANCE IS ACTUALLY THE ONE

01:13:37.579 --> 01:13:39.681
WHO PICKS UP MOST OF THE COST OF

01:13:39.748 --> 01:13:40.249
THIS.

01:13:40.315 --> 01:13:41.617
AND IF IT WAS THAT HUGE OF A

01:13:41.683 --> 01:13:42.417
DRIVER TO THEM I WOULD THINK

01:13:42.484 --> 01:13:43.886
THEY WOULD BE ONE OF THE BIGGEST

01:13:43.952 --> 01:13:46.555
PEOPLE IN HERE IN OPPOSITION.

01:13:46.622 --> 01:13:47.456
THE FACT THEY'RE NOT I THINK IS

01:13:47.523 --> 01:13:50.692
A IS A PRETTY TELLING POINT.

01:13:50.759 --> 01:13:52.594
I THANK YOU [inaudible]

01:13:52.661 --> 01:13:54.863
FOR IDENTIFIED.

01:13:54.930 --> 01:13:56.899
AGAIN A MARKER BLAME THE ENTIRE

01:13:56.965 --> 01:13:58.801
RISING COST OF HEALTHCARE ON THE

01:13:58.867 --> 01:14:01.937
GALLAGHER BILL.

01:14:02.004 --> 01:14:03.305
BUT PARTY GO.

01:14:03.372 --> 01:14:05.040
THE THE GALLAGHER MCCARTY BOB

01:14:05.107 --> 01:14:07.209
JUST LIKE YOU SAYING THAT -- BUT

01:14:07.276 --> 01:14:08.310
BUT I DO THINK IT'S IT'S

01:14:08.377 --> 01:14:09.778
IMPOSSIBLE NOT TO ACKNOWLEDGE

01:14:09.845 --> 01:14:11.513
THE TO CONTRIBUTOR TOWARDS RIGHT --

01:14:11.580 --> 01:14:12.648
INCREASE HEALTHCARE COSTS EVEN

01:14:12.714 --> 01:14:14.516
IF IT'S IN A NOBLE.

01:14:14.583 --> 01:14:16.318
DEED OR A NOBLE ACTIVITY THAT

01:14:16.385 --> 01:14:19.588
WE'RE IT'S MORE MONEY IN THE POT.

01:14:19.655 --> 01:14:21.390
AND YOU DIDN'T ADDRESS IN YOUR

01:14:21.456 --> 01:14:22.758
ANSWER ALL DOCTORS TO GET YOUR

01:14:22.825 --> 01:14:24.426
OPINION BECAUSE YOU AND I HAVE A

01:14:24.493 --> 01:14:25.961
DISTRICTS THAT ARE BOTH RURAL IN

01:14:26.028 --> 01:14:27.529
NATURE -- WHAT ABOUT THE

01:14:27.596 --> 01:14:29.364
PROVIDER ISSUE ARE YOU SATISFIED

01:14:29.431 --> 01:14:30.999
THERE'S ADEQUATE?

01:14:31.066 --> 01:14:38.273
HELP IN THIS SPACE -- OUT -- ROE

01:14:38.340 --> 01:14:39.842
VERSUS YOU KNOW MORE ABOUT WHEN

01:14:39.908 --> 01:14:40.709
YOU SAY PROVIDER DO YOU MEAN I

01:14:40.776 --> 01:14:41.677
MEAN BECAUSE IT DOESN'T

01:14:41.743 --> 01:14:44.947
NECESSARILY HAVE TO BE A DOCTOR.

01:14:45.013 --> 01:14:45.681
ALL RIGHT NINE EIGHT AND BUT I

01:14:45.747 --> 01:14:46.949
THINK THAT'S PART OF WHERE THIS

01:14:47.015 --> 01:14:48.150
FUNDING IS GOING TO IS.

01:14:48.217 --> 01:14:49.351
THE THE GOAL THAT IS TO HIRE

01:14:49.418 --> 01:14:52.120
MORE PEOPLE IN THE DRUG

01:14:52.187 --> 01:14:54.656
TREATMENT SPACE THOSE COULD BE.

01:14:54.723 --> 01:14:55.390
DOC SAY COULD BE YOU KNOW.

01:14:55.457 --> 01:14:57.960
DRUG TREATMENT SPECIALISTS --

01:14:58.026 --> 01:14:59.261
LIKE I SAID THERE'S ACTUALLY IN

01:14:59.328 --> 01:15:00.562
LISA MY DISTRICT IT'S MORE OF

01:15:00.629 --> 01:15:02.364
THIS THIS PRIVATE SPACES TAKING

01:15:02.431 --> 01:15:03.632
ADVANTAGE OF THE MONEY IN.

01:15:03.699 --> 01:15:06.201
AN EXPANDING EN EN.

01:15:06.268 --> 01:15:09.104
AND MAKING A DIFFERENCE YOU KNOW --

01:15:09.171 --> 01:15:09.705
BUT IN ORDER TO DO SO THEY'RE

01:15:09.771 --> 01:15:11.940
GONNA HAVE TO CONTINUE TO HAVE

01:15:12.007 --> 01:15:13.542
FUNDING SO THEY CAN HIRE.

01:15:13.609 --> 01:15:15.477
THOSE PEOPLE AN OPEN THE AND

01:15:15.544 --> 01:15:16.945
OPEN THE CLINICS TO MAKE.

01:15:17.012 --> 01:15:19.681
MAKE THAT TREATMENT AVAILABLE --

01:15:19.748 --> 01:15:21.550
SO I I I REALLY T&lt;c.cyan&gt; THE&lt;/c&gt;

01:15:21.617 --> 01:15:22.951
FUNDING TO THE ABILITY TO

01:15:23.018 --> 01:15:26.622
PROVIDE. TO HAVE MORE ACCESS.

01:15:26.688 --> 01:15:29.658
TO DRUG TREATMENT PROVIDERS --

01:15:29.725 --> 01:15:30.959
AND YOU KNOW E CAN GET INTO THE

01:15:31.026 --> 01:15:32.361
THE WHOLE OTHER ISSUE OF LIKE

01:15:32.427 --> 01:15:33.462
HEY DO WE NEED.

01:15:33.528 --> 01:15:35.163
NO NOT MORE NURSE PRACTITIONERS

01:15:35.230 --> 01:15:36.698
AND KNOWS IT IS WHO CAN

01:15:36.765 --> 01:15:37.833
PRESCRIBE.

01:15:37.900 --> 01:15:39.167
CERTAIN MEDICATIONS THAT'S

01:15:39.234 --> 01:15:40.769
ANOTHER THING THAT WE'VE TRIED

01:15:40.836 --> 01:15:42.738
TO DEAL WITH THAT I THINK WE DID

01:15:42.804 --> 01:15:44.339
PASSED LEGISLATION LAST YEAR --

01:15:44.406 --> 01:15:47.476
THAT DEALT WITH THAT ISSUE --

01:15:47.542 --> 01:15:49.278
BUT I DO CONNECT THE TWO AND

01:15:49.344 --> 01:15:51.713
THAT THIS WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL

01:15:51.780 --> 01:15:52.514
TO INSURING MORE ACCESS FOR

01:15:52.581 --> 01:15:53.482
APPRECIATE PRODUCTION PRECISELY

01:15:53.548 --> 01:15:54.950
MY POINT IS THAT THERE'S A

01:15:55.017 --> 01:15:56.852
NUMBER OF ISSUES MOVING FORWARD

01:15:56.919 --> 01:15:59.254
ON A PARALLEL TRACK HERE THAT --

01:15:59.321 --> 01:16:01.256
THEY MAYBE NEED TO BE CONSIDERED --

01:16:01.323 --> 01:16:02.658
IN CONCERT.

01:16:02.724 --> 01:16:04.726
AND THAT'S KIND OF MY POINT --

01:16:04.793 --> 01:16:05.861
TOWARD YOUR BILL IS NOT THAT

01:16:05.928 --> 01:16:06.662
THIS COULD BE PIECES SOLUTION

01:16:06.728 --> 01:16:08.230
BUT WE CERTAINLY HAVE TO LOOK AT

01:16:08.297 --> 01:16:10.198
THE OTHER -- THE OTHER SPOKES ON

01:16:10.265 --> 01:16:12.267
A WHEEL THERE AND I DON'T KNOW

01:16:12.334 --> 01:16:13.201
THAT WE'RE DOING THAT AND

01:16:13.268 --> 01:16:14.169
UNFORTUNATELY IT'S ONLY IN THESE

01:16:14.236 --> 01:16:15.304
MOMENTS WHEN BILLS ARE UP FOR

01:16:15.370 --> 01:16:16.905
VOTES THAT WE GET AN OPPORTUNITY

01:16:16.972 --> 01:16:19.708
TO APPLY THAT PRESSURE -- TO

01:16:19.775 --> 01:16:21.109
ACCOMPLISH THAT RIGHT BECAUSE

01:16:21.176 --> 01:16:24.212
OTHERWISE WE HEAR OVER TO TAKE

01:16:24.279 --> 01:16:26.315
CARE THAT OTHER PROBLEM LATER.

01:16:26.381 --> 01:16:27.883
AND LATER NEVER COMES RIGHT AND

01:16:27.950 --> 01:16:28.917
THOSE OF US LIBERAL COMMUNITIES

01:16:28.984 --> 01:16:30.252
AND HOW MANY TIMES WE EXPANDED --

01:16:30.319 --> 01:16:31.286
MEDI CAL AND IN ALL KINDS OF

01:16:31.353 --> 01:16:32.721
MAJOR INCREASES IN FUNDING AND

01:16:32.788 --> 01:16:33.622
WE DO NOTHING TO DO WITH THE

01:16:33.689 --> 01:16:34.189
PROVIDER SHORTAGE IN RURAL

01:16:34.256 --> 01:16:35.057
COMMUNITIES.

01:16:35.123 --> 01:16:36.992
AND WILL SOLVE YOUR PROBLEM WE

01:16:37.059 --> 01:16:38.460
GET THE NEXT BILLION AND THEN

01:16:38.527 --> 01:16:40.729
THE NEXT BILLION NEVER COMES SO --

01:16:40.796 --> 01:16:42.664
AGAIN WHILE I SUPPORT WHAT YOU

01:16:42.731 --> 01:16:43.398
GUYS ARE ATTEMPTING TO

01:16:43.465 --> 01:16:45.300
ACCOMPLISH THIS IN IN THIS BILL

01:16:45.367 --> 01:16:46.335
AND I THINK THERE'S A MAJOR

01:16:46.401 --> 01:16:47.936
EPIDEMIC HERE AND I AND I

01:16:48.003 --> 01:16:50.038
COMMEND YOU FOR TAKING IT ON I

01:16:50.105 --> 01:16:50.605
DON'T THINK I'M PREPARED TO

01:16:50.672 --> 01:16:51.773
SUPPORT.

01:16:51.840 --> 01:16:53.575
YOUR BILL TODAY I'M GONNA GO

01:16:53.642 --> 01:16:54.710
AHEAD LAY OFF LEAVE OPEN THE

01:16:54.776 --> 01:16:56.378
POSSIBILITY THAT I CAN SUPPORT

01:16:56.445 --> 01:16:58.780
THIS TOMORROW -- BUT I WANT TO

01:16:58.847 --> 01:16:59.815
ENGAGE IN.

01:16:59.881 --> 01:17:01.216
SOME MORE THOROUGH DISCUSSIONS

01:17:01.283 --> 01:17:03.118
ON THESE TOPICS SO THAT WE CAN

01:17:03.185 --> 01:17:03.752
MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE SOLVING THE

01:17:03.819 --> 01:17:05.921
WHOLE PROBLEM -- AND NOT JUST

01:17:05.988 --> 01:17:08.357
SHIFTING.

01:17:08.423 --> 01:17:10.726
THE PROBLEM AROUND.

01:17:10.792 --> 01:17:11.293
ANY OTHER COMMENTS FROM THE

01:17:11.360 --> 01:17:13.028

CONVERSATIONS ARE.

01:17:25.240 --> 01:17:26.041
OF YOU I HAD ONE QUESTION YOU'D

01:17:26.108 --> 01:17:26.708
MENTIONED EARLIER THAT THERE WAS

01:17:26.775 --> 01:17:29.411
FEDERAL FUNDING THAT WILL END IN.

01:17:29.478 --> 01:17:30.278
TWENTY TWENTY WAS THIS FEDERAL

01:17:30.345 --> 01:17:32.114
FUNDING FOR PUBLIC HEALTH

01:17:32.180 --> 01:17:33.448
PROGRAMS.

01:17:33.515 --> 01:17:36.084
FOR THESE PEOPLE OR CORRECT.

01:17:39.121 --> 01:17:40.455
FEDERAL MONEY.

01:17:40.522 --> 01:17:42.491
DIDN'T RUN OUT WHICH RIGHT NOW

01:17:42.557 --> 01:17:43.392
THE FOLKS AT CONGRESS ARE SAYING

01:17:43.458 --> 01:17:45.894
WE HADN'T TOLD TWENTY TWENTY AND

01:17:45.961 --> 01:17:47.729
WHO KNOWS THAT.

OUR WITNESSES EARLIER OUR OUR

01:17:52.934 --> 01:17:53.435
TESTIFYING THAT THEY COULD

01:17:53.502 --> 01:17:54.703
DRAMATICALLY USE MORE MONEY ON

01:17:54.770 --> 01:17:55.604
TOP OF THE FEDERAL MONEY RIGHT

01:17:55.670 --> 01:17:56.972
NOW THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO AREN'T

01:17:57.039 --> 01:17:58.006
BEING SERVED IN THIS.

01:17:58.073 --> 01:17:59.474
HUB AND SPOKE MODEL WHO DON'T

01:17:59.541 --> 01:18:00.842
HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO GET.

01:18:00.909 --> 01:18:03.211
THIS COMMITTEE TREATMENT TO TO

01:18:03.278 --> 01:18:04.479
TO GET OFF.

01:18:04.546 --> 01:18:08.617
THIS DEADLY DISEASE -- BUT YES --

01:18:08.683 --> 01:18:09.684
THE WE WE ARE ANTICIPATING THAT

01:18:09.751 --> 01:18:11.019
IT WOULD RUN OUT.

01:18:11.086 --> 01:18:13.688
AND IF THIS MEASURE BECAME LAW

01:18:13.755 --> 01:18:15.023
THE MONEY TO START COMING IN

01:18:15.090 --> 01:18:17.192
LITERALLY THE SAME YEAR THAT

01:18:17.259 --> 01:18:18.827

PLUS ONE SO IT ACTUALLY OP TIES

01:18:24.633 --> 01:18:26.134

REYES TODAY -- BUT I THINK THAT.

01:18:39.014 --> 01:18:41.283

01:19:02.904 --> 01:19:04.272
I DO THINK THAT THIS THAT AS AN

01:19:04.339 --> 01:19:05.907
ASSEMBLY AND SENATE WE HAVE

01:19:05.974 --> 01:19:07.008

SAID ASSEMBLYMEMBER GALLAGHER I%

01:19:08.910 --> 01:19:09.845
THINK WE'VE LOOKED AT HOW DO WE

01:19:09.911 --> 01:19:10.979
SLOW THE BLEEDING ON THE

01:19:11.046 --> 01:19:12.547
SITUATION BUT WE HAVEN'T SPENT

01:19:12.614 --> 01:19:13.915
ACTUALLY AS MUCH TIME ON

01:19:13.982 --> 01:19:15.317
ADDICTION.

01:19:15.383 --> 01:19:15.851
AND THOSE THAT ARE ALREADY

01:19:15.917 --> 01:19:17.853
ADDICTED -- I AM A LITTLE

01:19:17.919 --> 01:19:19.721
DISAPPOINTED BY SOME OF THE

01:19:19.788 --> 01:19:21.656
TESTIMONY OF THE OPPOSITION I'M

01:19:21.723 --> 01:19:23.592
TO SAY BUSINESS AS USUAL IS OKAY

01:19:23.658 --> 01:19:25.627
IS CLEARLY NOT THE CASE AND A

01:19:25.694 --> 01:19:26.862
LOT OF OUR DISTRICTS WHERE WE

01:19:26.928 --> 01:19:29.731
HAVE MORE UPDATE PROJECT

01:19:29.798 --> 01:19:30.265
PRESCRIPTIONS THEN WE HAVE

01:19:30.332 --> 01:19:31.466
PEOPLE -- AND I THINK THERE'S A

01:19:31.533 --> 01:19:32.334
REAL CONCERN AND THERE'S A REAL

01:19:32.400 --> 01:19:33.802
NEED TO PARTICIPATE IN THAT I

01:19:33.869 --> 01:19:35.170
DON'T THINK THE INTENTION OF THE

01:19:35.237 --> 01:19:36.037
BUT THIS BILL IS TO HAVE

01:19:36.104 --> 01:19:38.106
PHARMACISTS TAKE ON THIS BURDEN

01:19:38.173 --> 01:19:39.374
EIGHT I DON'T BELIEVE THAT

01:19:39.441 --> 01:19:39.941
THAT'S THE INTENTION AND I'M

01:19:40.008 --> 01:19:40.642
SURE.

01:19:40.709 --> 01:19:42.577
THE OTHERS WILL CONTINUE TO WORK

01:19:42.644 --> 01:19:44.880
ON THIS TO TO ASSURE THAT --

01:19:44.946 --> 01:19:47.549
THREE OUT OF FOUR TEENAGERS

01:19:47.616 --> 01:19:49.217
BEGIN THEIR HER WAY INTO HEROIN

01:19:49.284 --> 01:19:52.220
ADDICTION WITH A PRESCRIPTION

01:19:52.287 --> 01:19:54.689
OPIOID.

01:19:54.756 --> 01:19:55.557
IN THEIR HOME AND UP UP CLEARLY

01:19:55.624 --> 01:19:56.191
THAT WAS PRESCRIBED TO THEM BY A

01:19:56.258 --> 01:19:57.058
DOCTOR.

01:19:57.125 --> 01:19:59.027
SO THIS IS A SERIOUS EPIDEMIC

01:19:59.094 --> 01:20:00.328
AND IT'S GOING TO TAKE SERIOUS

01:20:00.395 --> 01:20:01.930
WORK TO CREATE A SOLUTION TO

01:20:01.997 --> 01:20:03.865
THIS PROBLEM AND I DO AGREE WITH

01:20:03.932 --> 01:20:05.567
ASSEMBLY MEMBER GRAY THAT THIS

01:20:05.634 --> 01:20:07.302
IS NOT THE TOTAL SOLUTION.

01:20:07.369 --> 01:20:08.703
HOWEVER WE NEED FUNDS WE NEED

01:20:08.770 --> 01:20:10.105
FUNDS FOR RURAL COMMUNITIES WE

01:20:10.172 --> 01:20:11.540
NEED FUNDS FOR CLINICS.

01:20:11.606 --> 01:20:13.542
AND ALTHOUGH NOT THE PERFECT

01:20:13.608 --> 01:20:15.110
SOLUTION I DO THINK THIS IS A

01:20:15.177 --> 01:20:16.811
STEP FORWARD AND CONVERSATION

01:20:16.878 --> 01:20:19.514
AND A SOLUTION FOR ADDICTION.

01:20:19.581 --> 01:20:23.084
NOT THE COMPLETE PROBLEM --

01:20:23.151 --> 01:20:24.519
THERE ARE CROP COST DRIVERS --

01:20:24.586 --> 01:20:26.087
BUT WE ALL DO PAY FOR OPIATE

01:20:26.154 --> 01:20:27.155
ADDICTION.

01:20:27.222 --> 01:20:27.989
WHETHER IT IS IN OUR HEALTH

01:20:28.056 --> 01:20:30.192
INSURANCE PREMIUMS ARE IN STATE

01:20:30.258 --> 01:20:32.561
FUNDS I MEDI CAL WE ALL PAY FOR

01:20:32.627 --> 01:20:32.994
IT.

01:20:33.061 --> 01:20:35.096
SO TO ELIMINATE MANUFACTURERS

01:20:35.163 --> 01:20:36.798
FROM PAYING FOR IT I THINK IT'S

01:20:36.865 --> 01:20:38.400
UNREALISTIC AT THIS POINT.

01:20:38.466 --> 01:20:40.368
WITH THAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO

01:20:40.435 --> 01:20:41.703
CLOSE.

01:20:41.770 --> 01:20:42.804
I I JUST -- APPRECIATE THAT THE

01:20:42.871 --> 01:20:44.339
DEBATE HERE IN THIS IS NOT

01:20:44.406 --> 01:20:46.508
ALWAYS AN EASY -- CONVERSATION

01:20:46.575 --> 01:20:49.377
HAVE ABOUT IT -- CHARGING A FEE

01:20:49.444 --> 01:20:51.012
I I DON'T THINK IT'S A TAX IT'S

01:20:51.079 --> 01:20:56.518
NOT A CERTAINLY NOT A JOB KILLER

01:20:56.585 --> 01:20:58.320
ANY PRODUCTS WHAT WE KNOW.

01:20:58.386 --> 01:21:00.188
SOMETHING ON THE OTHER NATIVE

01:21:00.255 --> 01:21:02.123
HAPPENS AND YOU OUTLINED IT

01:21:02.190 --> 01:21:04.359
THERE IS THAT -- YEAH THIS IS

01:21:04.426 --> 01:21:05.627
NOT GOING TO SOLVE THE FEDERAL

01:21:05.694 --> 01:21:07.529
CRISIS AND I CAN KERR BUT PEOPLE

01:21:07.596 --> 01:21:09.631

01:21:09.698 --> 01:21:11.199
BECAUSE THEY EVERY ABUSING PAIN

01:21:11.266 --> 01:21:12.234
KILLERS.

01:21:12.300 --> 01:21:13.235
AND THE INDUSTRY HAS

01:21:13.301 --> 01:21:15.537
RESPONSIBILITY STEP UP AS PART

01:21:15.604 --> 01:21:18.206
OF THE SOLUTION.

01:21:18.273 --> 01:21:19.274
YEAH WOULD YOU SAID THIS IS IT I

01:21:19.341 --> 01:21:20.542
THINK AS YOU OUTLINE I MEAN THIS

01:21:20.609 --> 01:21:22.978
IS A VERY UNIQUE SITUATION --

01:21:23.044 --> 01:21:25.981
AND IT IS A VERY UNIQUE CRISIS.

01:21:26.047 --> 01:21:27.249
YEAH I'M CERTAINLY NOT THE ONE

01:21:27.315 --> 01:21:28.350
THAT'S ALWAYS.

01:21:28.416 --> 01:21:29.618
STEPPING UP TO SAY HEY WE SHOULD

01:21:29.684 --> 01:21:32.854
HAVE MORE FEES OR OR A YOU KNOW.

01:21:32.921 --> 01:21:34.656

01:21:37.859 --> 01:21:39.027
DONE.

01:21:39.094 --> 01:21:41.296
I THINK IT IS WARRANTED -- AND

01:21:41.363 --> 01:21:42.597
IT JUST SAYS HEY YOU KNOW.

01:21:42.664 --> 01:21:43.898
MANUFACTURES BE PART OF THE

01:21:43.965 --> 01:21:45.934
SOLUTION BE PART OF THE SOLUTION

01:21:46.001 --> 01:21:47.269
TO GET PEOPLE OFF OF THIS.

01:43:12.719 --> 01:43:14.254
TOTALLY INAPPROPRIATE AS A WRITE

01:43:14.321 --> 01:43:16.490

IN REVENUE ON TOP OF THE FACT

01:43:20.093 --> 01:43:21.562
THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT JUST

01:43:21.628 --> 01:43:22.930
EXPANDED.

01:43:22.996 --> 01:43:25.933

01:43:36.443 --> 01:43:37.477

01:43:44.084 --> 01:43:45.419
ANY -- MYSTERIES.

01:43:45.485 --> 01:43:46.853
I WAS ACTUALLY GOING -- TO TO

01:43:46.920 --> 01:43:48.288
MOVE THIS THINKING BECAUSE I

01:43:48.355 --> 01:43:49.890
UNDERSTAND THE IMPACT OF NOT

01:43:49.957 --> 01:43:52.960
HAVING ENOUGH DOCTORS IN.

01:43:53.026 --> 01:43:54.928
IN CALIFORNIA.

01:43:54.995 --> 01:43:55.896
BUT AS SOMEBODY WHO USED TO

01:43:55.963 --> 01:43:58.832
PREPARE TAXES -- I WAS SHOCKED

01:43:58.899 --> 01:44:01.368
AT THE NUMBER OF OF INDIVIDUALS --

01:44:01.435 --> 01:44:02.703
WHO WOULD COME IN WITH TEN

01:44:02.769 --> 01:44:04.504
NINETY NINES IN FACT SOMETIMES

01:44:04.571 --> 01:44:05.772
ROLES OF TEN NINETY NINES?

01:44:05.839 --> 01:44:07.374
I'M YOU'D HAVE -- WE HAD A LOT

01:44:07.441 --> 01:44:10.043
OF NURSES THAT WOULD -- FIND

01:44:10.110 --> 01:44:12.245
THEMSELVES GAMBLING I'M QUITE A

01:44:12.312 --> 01:44:14.815
BIT OF THOSE WHO IS A NICHE OF

01:44:14.881 --> 01:44:16.450
BUSINESS THAT I HAD.

01:44:16.516 --> 01:44:20.053
AND IT ALMOST ALWAYS IF THEY HAD

01:44:20.120 --> 01:44:20.621
FIFTY SIXTY SEVENTY THOUSAND

01:44:20.687 --> 01:44:22.389
DOLLARS OF INCOME ALMOST ALWAYS

01:44:22.456 --> 01:44:24.725
THEY HAD FIFTY SIXTY SEVENTY

01:44:24.791 --> 01:44:25.659
THOUSAND DOLLARS OF LOSSES

01:44:25.726 --> 01:44:27.728
COURSE MAKE PERFECT SENSE -- THE

01:44:27.794 --> 01:44:29.696
FOR THAT TO BE THE CASE AND SO

01:44:29.763 --> 01:44:31.298
WOULD BE DIFFICULT WITHOUT THAT

01:44:31.365 --> 01:44:32.566
AND FOR ME IT WILL SUPPORT THAT.

01:44:32.633 --> 01:44:33.734
TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE REVENUE

01:44:33.800 --> 01:44:35.202
WOULD BE USED FOR WHICH THERE IS

01:44:35.268 --> 01:44:36.703
A DEFINITE NEED -- BUT JUST

01:44:36.770 --> 01:44:38.305
UNDERSTANDING THAT THERE ARE A

01:44:38.372 --> 01:44:40.173
LOT OF FOLKS WHO DO GAMBLE AND

01:44:40.240 --> 01:44:41.875
THAT HAVE SIGNIFICANT LOSSES IN

01:44:41.942 --> 01:44:42.943
ESSENCE THEY'RE GONNA BE PAYING

01:44:43.010 --> 01:44:44.511
A TAX FOR FOR INCOME THAT

01:44:44.578 --> 01:44:45.512
THEY'VE NEVER.

01:44:45.579 --> 01:44:48.749
THEY'VE NEVER RECEIVED AND SO

01:44:48.815 --> 01:44:51.084
OFTEN THAT TO STAY OFF TODAY.

01:44:51.151 --> 01:44:52.886
IT DOES CONCERT I CERTAINLY WAY

01:44:52.953 --> 01:44:55.656
THAT QUESTION IN MY MIND --

01:44:55.722 --> 01:44:56.256
ARRIVED AT THE CONCLUSION IT

01:44:56.323 --> 01:44:57.824
GAMBLING LIKE MANY OTHER FORMS

01:44:57.891 --> 01:44:58.325
