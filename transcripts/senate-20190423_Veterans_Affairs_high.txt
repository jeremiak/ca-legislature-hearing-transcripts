GENTLEMAN AND WELCOME TO THE SENATE VETERANS AFFAIRS COMMITTEE EARING. AND I WELCOME YOU ALL AND I'D LIKE TO BEGIN OUR MEETING. THE FIRST THING I DO IS HAVE OUR VETERANS STAND UP AND BE RECOGNIZED PLEASE STAND. ARE VETERANS [inaudible] THANK YOU. IN THE CENTER LEVEL THAT'S HOW WE BEGIN OUR VETERANS COMMITTEE. EVERY TIME. THAT'S IT SO. OF THE USC MARCHING BAND COULDN'T GET IN THE FRONT DOOR BUT WE'LL GET HIM NEXT TIME. ANYWAY -- THANK YOU ALL FOR BEING HERE AND I APPRECIATE YOUR SUPPORT THOSE WHO SERVED OUR GREAT COUNTRY -- IN ALL OF YOU WHO LOVE OUR VETERANS AS WELL THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. THE SENATE COMMITTEE I THINK WE'RE ABOUT READY TO START I THINK WE MAY HAVE A ROLE OF OF THE FULL -- FULL AGENDA BUT I THINK WE MAY HAVE ENOUGH TO HAVE A FULL A FULL HEARING SHOWS. MADAM SECRETARY TO CALL THE ROLL. ARCHULETA [inaudible] ROW [inaudible] NIELSEN [inaudible] NUMBER [inaudible] WELL. WE'VE GOT. OKAY WE HAVE A QUORUM. SO. LET'S GO AHEAD AND BEGIN. THE THE FIRST ITEM ON THE AGENDA. WILL BE CENTER LEYVA SB. THREE TWELVE AND TENDER LABOR WOULD YOU PRESENT YOUR GUEST AS WELL PLACE. AND I THINK THEY'RE BACK IN THE BACK. YES WE HAVE A VARIETY OF GAS AND I WILL LET THEM INTRODUCE THEMSELVES ONCE WE GET TO THAT POINT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR ARCHULETA I HAVE TO SAY THAT WHEN I WAS FIRST ELECTED TO THE SENATE OF PEOPLE TOLD ME DO NOT FALL IN LOVE WITH YOUR BILLS. WELL I FALL IN LOVE WITH SOME OF MY BILLS AND THIS IS A BILL THAT I HAVE FALLEN IN LOVE WITH. BECAUSE THE EFFECTS THAT IT CAN HAVE AND THE LIVES IT CAN CHANGE SO WITH THAT I WILL START BY THANKING YOU AND YOUR STAFF FOR YOUR HARD WORK ON THIS BILL AND IS VERY IMPORTANT MAJOR THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SB THREE TWELVE WOULD REQUIRE THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS CALVET TO ESTABLISH A COMPETITIVE GRANT PROGRAM TO PROVIDE VETERANS SUFFERING FROM POST TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER PTSD. BUT THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH ACQUIRING AND CARING FOR A SERVICE DOG. CALIFORNIA IS HOME TO NEARLY TWO MILLION VETERANS THE HIGHEST OF ANY STATE IN OUR UNION. THESE BRAVE MEN AND WOMEN RESTORE LIVES DURING THEIR MILITARY SERVICE IN SOME CASES SUFFERED SEVERE TRAUMA THAT RESULTED IN PTSD. FOR VETERANS THERE IS A LACK OF ACCESS TO MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AND THIS IS MADE REINTEGRATION INTO NORMAL CIVILIAN LIFE CHALLENGING FOR THESE VETERANS AND FOR THEIR FAMILIES. THE TRAUMA THAT SOME VETERANS INTER AS A RESULT OF COMBAT SERVICE HAS ALSO LED TO INCREASED RATES OF SUICIDE. SADLY 5220% VETERANS SUFFER FROM PTSD. AND ON AVERAGE TWENTY VETERANS PER DAY. OR ONE EVERY SIXTY FIVE MINUTES COMMIT SUICIDE. THAT IS A RATE ONE AND A HALF TIMES HIGHER THAN NOT VETERANS. EARLIER THIS MONTH THREE US MILITARY VETERANS DIED BY SUICIDE OVER A SPAN OF FIVE DAYS ALL IT BE A FACILITIES. THIS LOSS OF LIFE IS TRAGIC AND UNACCEPTABLE. OUR VETERAN COMMUNITY IS SUFFERING AND IS CRITICAL THAT WE FIND WAYS TO REDUCE VETERANS SO SITES. STUDIES AND NUMEROUS EXAMPLES SHOW THAT PAIRING VETERANS WITH SERVICE DOGS HAS A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON REDUCING SYMPTOMS OF PTSD. UNFORTUNATELY ACCESSING SERVICE DOGS CAN BE EXTREMELY DIFFICULT FOR VETERANS TO TO COSTS. LACK OF AWARENESS AND LITTLE TO NO SUPPORT FROM STATE OR LOCAL GOVERNMENT. ALTHOUGH SOME NONPROFITS WORK TO PAIR VETERANS WITH SERVICE STOCKS ACROSS HER STATES. THERE ARE STATE THEIR SOURCES RESOURCES ARE LIMITED SO MUCH MORE CAN BE DONE AND MUST BE DONE. THIS MEASURE WOULD AWARD GRANTS TO CERTIFIED VETERANS SERVICE DOG PROVIDERS TO HELP VETERANS SUFFERING PTO FROM PTSD WITH THE COST OF ACQUIRING A SERVICE DOG. AND PROVIDING TRAINING EQUIPMENT AND VETS SERVICES. SB THREE TWELVE WILL ENSURE THAT VETERANS ARE PROVIDED THE ASSISTANCE NEEDED TO CARE FOR A SERVICE DOG. WITH ME TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OUR DOCTOR KATHY STRONG FROM USA STRONG FOR VETERANS. ANDY MAKE TEA PRESIDENT OF VETERANS CANINE INTELLIGENCE ACADEMY. AND I'M NOT SURE. ARE YOU WENDY HI WENDY WE HAVE WINDY CLARK JOHNSON FROM CANINE COMPANIONS FOR INDEPENDENCE. AND YOU JUST INTRODUCE YOURSELF AND I FORGOT. BRUCE PITTMAN IS HERE AS WELL AS WELL AS MANY SERVICE DOGS AS YOU CAN ALL SEE SO I WILL TURN IT OVER TO MY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. GO RIGHT AHEAD KATIE STRONG -- I'M A MARATHON RUNNER A MOM ACOSTA COLLEGES AND AN EDUCATIONAL CYCLE -- I AM HERE -- FOR THE VETERANS AND BECAUSE THEY HAVE INSPIRED ME SO MUCH -- I WAS DOING RESEARCH A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO AFTER MY FATHER PASSEDAWAY -- ON WORLD WAR ONE WORLD WAR TWO AND THE KOREAN WAR ARE JUST TRYING TO FIND OUT WHAT MY FATHER GRANDFATHER HAD GONE THROUGH BUT THEIR EXPERIENCES WERE LIKE. AND I RAN ACROSS AN ARTICLE THAT TALKED ABOUT THE TWENTY TWOS. I'M A CIVILIAN AND I NEVER HEARD ABOUT IT AND I WAS QUITE SHOCKED I CAN BELIEVE THAT -- THAT WAS OCCURRING AND I COULDN'T BELIEVE ALSO THAT THE REST OF THE CIVILIAN POPULATION THAT I KNEW OF DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT THIS EITHER. I CAN UNDERSTAND WHY IT'S NOT ON THE TV NEWS EVERY NIGHT -- I TALKED TO MY COLLEAGUES MY FRIENDS MANY PEOPLE AND NOBODY KNEW ABOUT IT. AND I REALIZE THAT -- THAT NEEDED TO BE CHANGED BECAUSE THEY WERE NOT AWARE ABOUT THIS PROBLEM THEN HOW ARE YOU GOING TO HELP TO CHANGE IT ONCE WERE ALL WHERE THEN WE CAN REALLY WORK TOGETHER TO MAKE CHANGE. SO YOU MIGHT THINK I'M TOO SO MUCH IS SHORT OF A PICNIC BUT IN ORDER TO WORK RAISE AWARENESS I RAN ACROSS UNITED STATES FROM OREGON TO WASHINGTON DC. TWENTY FIVE TO THIRTY FIVE MILES A DAY AND ALONG THE WAY I SPOKE TO A NEWS -- TELEVISION NEWS -- CASTS ARE WAS AMUSED AT CAL SEVEN CHANNEL FOUR A FOX NEWS I SPOKE TO NEWSPAPERS JUST TRYING TO GET THE WORD OUT TRYING TO COMMUNICATE WHAT WAS GOING ON IN AND I WANTED TO TALK JUST A MINUTE ABOUT MY EXPERIENCE OF RUNNING WHERE I ALMOST GAVE UP -- I RAN FACING THE TRAFFIC AS YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO DO -- AS A RUNNER AND ARM JUST TO STAY SAFE AND THEN -- TRAFFIC COMING OUT ME ON FOR ABOUT A HUNDRED MILES -- I WAS REALLY START TO GET TOO CONCERNED BECAUSE I WAS LITERALLY WITHIN ARM'S REACH OF BIG RIGS WHEELS I CAN REACH OUT AND I COULD LITERALLY TOUCH THEM BECAUSE THERE IS A STILL SMALL SLIVER OF ROAD THAT I COULD. RUN ACROSS AND I JUST STARTED THINK YOU KNOW MAN I I DON'T THINK I'M GOING TO MAKE IT YOU KNOW I I THINK THIS IS JUST REALLY RISKY. I THOUGHT FOR A MINUTE YOU KNOW I WONDER VETERANS EVER SAY THAT I DON'T KNOW IF I'M GOING TO MAKE IT THIS IS REALLY RISKY. I THOUGHT ABOUT THEM AND I REMEMBER THE REASON WHY I STARTED OUT IN THE FIRST PLACE. AND THEN I REALIZED YEAH AT THIS VERY MOMENT SERVICEMEN AND WOMEN ARE OVERSEAS THEY'RE FIGHTING FOR ME THEY'RE FIGHTING FOR MY COME MY COUNTRY AND THEY'RE NOT GIVING INTO FEAR THEY'RE NOT QUITTING. AND SO I DECIDED NO MATTER WHAT FOR THEM I'M GONNA FINISH OR DIE TRYING. AND SO I DID FINISH AND I'M HERE AND I'M TRYING TO FIGHT FOR IT FOR THIS BILL FOR THEM BECAUSE IT'S SO HELPFUL -- YOU WENT OVER SOME OF THE FACTS -- THE SUICIDE RATE IF YOU LOOK AT IT A YEARLY NUMBERS OVER SEVEN THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED PER YEAR. AND I'M APPOINTED WITH PERSONALLY OF SOME FAMILIES NOW -- MANY FAMILIES NOW THAT HAVE LOST THEIR SENSE TO TO SUICIDE. THE CURRENT TREATMENT FOR PTSD IS MEDICATION AND PSYCHOTHERAPY THIS PROVIDES ITS BENEFIT FOR ALMOST ABOUT 70% BUT THE OTHER DON'T BENEFIT FROM THIS COMBINATION THE TWO OF THEM IS ALL THAT THEY HAVE OPTION TO THEIR VERY RARELY ARE OFFERED ANY OTHER OPTIONS. BUT THE THIRD OPTION IS -- YOU KNOW IF THE SOONEST THEIR ARMS SERVICE DOG -- THE 30% OF THEIR OFFER THIS THIRD OPTION THAT WOULD BE VERY BENEFICIAL THE SERVICE ON TREATMENT HAS A REALLY HIGH RATE OF SUCCESS -- AT DECREASING SUICIDALITY AND INCREASING LIFE SATISFACTION -- THERE IN THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS THERE'S BEEN SOME EMPIRICAL STUDIES THAT VALIDATED THIS AS A TREATMENT -- RECENT STUDIES FROM THE PURDUE-UNIVERSITY OUR DEPARTMENT OF ANIMAL SCIENCE DID A PHYSIOLOGICAL STUDY ON CORTISOL LEVELS. WHERE'S ALL LEVELS BEING IN THE HOME ON THAT THE BODY SECRETES WHEN IT'S UNDER HIGH CRIME THIS CHRONIC STRESS. AND THE CORTISOL LEVELS WERE DECREASED SIGNIFICANTLY IN THIS RESEARCH STUDY -- SO WITH -- DR -- HERE IS ALSO FROM THAT -- ANIMAL SCIENCE -- DEPARTMENT SHE'S ALSO WORKED WITH THE CENTER FOR HUMAN ANIMAL BOND. AND SHE FOUND THAT COMPARED TO INDIVIDUALS ON THE WAIT LIST FOR SERVICE DOGS THOSE WHO ACTUALLY HAD SERVICE DOGS HAD THE SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER CYCLE SOCIAL HEALTH INCREASED EMOTIONAL HEALTH. INCREASE SOCIAL AND WORK AND SCHOOL FUNCTIONING. AND SHE ALSO WAS WORKING WITH THE STUDY ON CORTISOL LEVELS AND THAT IS A VERY IMPORTANT FINDING -- FINALLY -- I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH YOU KNOW ABOUT SERVICE DOGS -- BUT THEY ARE SET APART PROMOTIONAL AND OF SIR A MOTIONAL SUPPORT DOGS AND CATS. BECAUSE NOT ONLY ARE THEY TRAINED IN THE SEVEN BASIC COMMANDS THEY ARE ALSO TRAINED TO DO -- TASKS SPECIFIC TO EACH INDIVIDUAL BET WHAT THEY NEED IN PARTICULAR. AND THERE ARE OVER A HUNDRED FOURTY TASKS THAT THEY CAN PERFORM. A FEW OF THEM THAT ARE SPECIFIC TO PTSD. AND ANY VETERAN. WITH A SERVICE DOG CAN ATTEST TO THE FACT THAT THEIR DOG IS A LOYAL CARING AND DEDICATED FORCE. THAT GIVES THEIR LIFE FOR THEM -- TWENTY FOUR SEVEN THEIR THERE FOR THEM THE BOND TOWARDS -- THEIR SERVICE DOG AND THE SERVICE DOGS BY TOWARDS A VETERAN IS UNDER MY UNDENIABLY BENEFICIAL AND LIFESAVING. AND SO I'M HERE TODAY -- TO ASK YOU. YEAH. WE WANT TO GIVE EACH. SO YEAH. SHORT IT WILL COME BACK OKAY YEAH ONE I AM ABLE TO HAVE. RIGHT. THANK YOU SO I'M I'M JUST HERE TO PRESENT THAT INFORMATION AND I'D BE HONORED AND THANKFUL IF THE MEMBERS -- HERE WOULD BE ABLE TO PASS THE SENATE BILL -- ISABEL THAT'LL WILL ASSIST VETERANS AND LEAD TO MORE FULFILLING LIVES AND IT ABSOLUTELY WILL SAVE LIVES FOR MANY YEARS TO COME. THANK YOU [inaudible] VERY BRIEFLY. WE SAVE LIVES EVERY DAY. IF WE PREVENT THE TWENTY TWO I HAVE DOGS AND VETERANS THAT COME TO ME ON A DAILY BASIS THEY START TRAINING THE DAY THEY SHOW UP [inaudible] IT'S WORKING. THE FURTHER WHEN THE IN OKAY. MY NAME IS WHEN THE CLOCK JOHNSON I'M HERE SO -- REPRESENTING KEENING COMPANIONS FOR INDEPENDENCE FOR THE LARGEST NONPROFIT. ORGANIZATION THAT PLACES DOGS IN HOMES ON A VARIETY DISABILITIES FREE OF CHARGE TO THE PERSON WHO RECEIVES THEM. CURRENTLY WE HAVE APPROXIMATELY TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED TEAMS WORKING NATIONWIDE THIS IS NOT A NATION WIDE PROGRAM. OF OF THAT THERE'S JUST UNDER THREE HUNDRED GRADUATE TEAMS ARE SPECIFICALLY WORKING WITH VETERANS AND A VARIETY OF TASKS AS THE DOCTOR EXPLAINED. THESE PUPPIES ARE ALL THROUGH THE PROGRAM THIS LITTLE GIRL HERE IS ACTUALLY IN TRAINING SO SHE'S LEARNING INSPIRING TO BE WHAT'S RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU -- THEY START WITH A THEIR WITH A PERSON -- FROM THE TIME THEY'RE BORN ACTUALLY I HAVE USE IN MY HOME ALL THE TIME. WE RAISE THEM AND THEN WE TURN THEM IN WHEN THEY GO THE PROFESSIONAL TRAINING. THAT'S GREAT IT'S WONDERFUL I AM NOT A VETERAN BUT I COME FROM A FAMILY OF STE OF VETERANS MY DAD GRANDPARENTS BOTH OF MY SISTERS ARE VETERANS. I DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT SERVICE DOGS I KNEW ABOUT THE PROBLEMS THAT HAPPENED WHEN THEY CAME HOME I KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH MY SISTER BUT AS A PERSON WHO IS NOW BEEN VOLUNTEERING FOR TEN YEARS. INTEL I BECAME PART OF KING AND COMPANIONS I DID NOT KNOW. AND SO THAT IS A HUGE PIECES THE SENATOR MENTIONED THE OUT REACHES OUT THERE WHAT I WILL TELL YOU OF THE VETERANS THAT I MEET. THEY SAY [inaudible] THAT'S GREAT. I'M NOT DISABLED ENOUGH I'M NOT WANTED ENOUGH PLEASE GIVE THE STOCK TO SOMEONE WHO NEEDS IT. AND THEY NEED IT SO I AM TOTALLY HONORED BECAUSE AS A PUPPY RAISER AT THE GREAT HISTORY WE HAVE AS OUR DOGS GO FROM YELLOW COAT. TO A BLUE COAT AS WIMBERLEY IS HERE THE ENERGIES BRUCE AND GRADUATE TEAM I'M IS SERVICE DOG WEMBLEY. HELLO -- I'M BRUCE PITTMAN I MAY -- RECENT RETIRED -- MARINE -- AND I RECEIVED WEMBLEY IN SEPTEMBER -- WHEN WHEN I WERE A PART THE FIRST CLASS OF -- PTSD GRADUATES OUT OF CANINE COMPANIONS. AND THERE WERE THERE WERE FOUR OF US THAT TO GRADUATE WITH DOGS -- IN THAT PROGRAM AND HE HAS BEEN ABSOLUTE LIFE CHANGING. PART OF MY MY FAMILY AT THIS POINT. HE AND I GO EVERYWHERE TOGETHER. PRIOR TO HAVING WEMBLEY -- I WILL I WOOD CICHLID MYSELF I WOULD NOT GO OUT ANYWHERE UNLESS I WAS WITH MY WIFE -- I HAVE REFERRED TO AS MY SERVICE DOG PRIOR TO LEARNING ABOUT SERVICE DOGS HAVE -- AND AND REALLY SHE'S THE ONLY REASON WHY I WOULD GO OUT WAS IF I WAS WITH HER AND I ARE OTHERWISE WOULD NOT TO GO OUT IN PUBLIC -- AND WEBLEY HAS HAS ENABLED ME TO DO THAT ON MY OWN AND AND IT HAS BEEN A TREMENDOUS ASSET. AND HIS HIS SKILLS HE NOT ONLY DOES THE HELP ME WITH THE THE PTSD PIECES OF OF OF MY LIFE BUT HE ALSO DOES A LOT OF MOBILITY THINGS FOR ME AS WELL -- HE'S ABLE TO RETRIEVE THINGS PICK THINGS UP HE CAN OPEN DOORS -- AND HE'S HE'S JUST BEEN A TREMENDOUS ASSET YEAH I'VE HAD SINCE SEPTEMBER AND HE'S COMPLETELY CHANGED MY LIFE. IT'S BEEN THE BEST THING THAT HAS HAPPENED TO ME SINCE MY THIRTY FOUR YEARS OF SERVICE IN THE MARINE CORPS AND AND MY RETIREMENT AND SUPPORT THAT. THAT I HAVE RECEIVED FROM THE VA YOU KNOW THE VA'S WORKING HARDER A LOT OF VETERANS OUT THERE. BUT A SERVICE DOG. IS BY FAR THE MOST -- ENABLING. TOOL TO A SERVICE MEMBER -- CAN'T SPEAKA MORE HIGHLY ABOUT THE PROGRAM CANINE COMPANIONS -- PROVIDING FREE DOG -- TO TO LET NEED THEM -- AND ABSOLUTELY LIFE CHANGING -- THIS PROGRAM IS INVALUABLE TO TO OUR SERVICE MEMBERS AND THEY DON'T GET MUCH OF A VOICE THAT'S WHY I'M HERE AND ONE MAKE SURE THAT. THE YOU'LL HAVE A CHANCE TO TO TO TO TALK TO ME AND OTHER VETERANS IN THAT HAVE DOGS AND CAN EXPRESS TO YOU. THE IMPORTANCE OF THEM. THE VA DOES NOT RECOGNIZE -- PTSD -- SERVICE DOGS -- DATE SO THE VA WILL PROVIDE. FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR SERVICE YOU HAVE TO HAVE A PHYSICAL DISABILITY. IF IT'S A MENTAL DISABILITY. THE VA DOES NOT CURRENTLY RECOGNIZE THAT -- AND THAT IS A SIGNIFICANT BURDEN TO PEOPLE OF ANY OTHER CHALLENGE FINANCALLY -- I DON'T SUFFER FROM THAT -- MY THIRTY FOUR YEARS OF SERVICE I'M I'M PRETTY WELL OFF. AND CAN AFFORD TO PAY FOR A PET A DOG BUT THE VET BILLS ALONE CAN BE ENOUGH -- TO PUT A A A VETERAN IN FINANCIAL STRAITS. AND THE VA WILL NOT COVER THAT -- AND CANINE COMPANIONS. NOW THEY'VE GIVEN ME THIS BEAUTIFUL ANIMAL. ESTIMATE TO BE ABOUT FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A DOG TO TRAIN THEM -- THEY'RE NOT ABLE TO PROVIDE ME WITH FINANCIAL SUPPORT NICE MY BURDEN AND I AS AS THE HANDLER -- TO TO PAPERS VET BILLS A FEEDING A AND ANY MEDICAL REQUIREMENTS THANK YOU BRUCE YES -- THE CENTER LEYVA WANT YOU TO GO AEAD AND INVITE WHOEVER ELSE WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK ON BEHALF OF THE BILL LET'S BRING THEM UP.

BUT WE ALSO STARTED A VIDEO TOUR IS ONE OF OUR VETERANS STARTED WHEN HE WAS DONE PROGRAM WHERE THEY GET DOGS AT THE POUND AND THEY DO THIS TRAINING AND THEY PLACE SUCCESSFULLY OVER SIXTY FIVE DOGS WITH VETERAN SO WHEN YOU SEE THESE VETERANS. AND OUT IN THE COMMUNITY THAT HAVE PTSD THAT ARE NOW GOING TO FOOTBALL GAMES AND PUBLIC EVENTS. BECAUSE THE DOG AXES A PROTECT INTO OR AID. THE DOCKING FEEL THE PERSON GETTING AGITATED OR GETTING AND AND IT NERVOUS OR WHATEVER THE ISSUE IS AND THE DOG ACTS AS A BARRIER TO KEEP I DON'T SEE PEOPLE WAY NOT IN A VICIOUS WAY BUT JUST. STANDS IN FRONT OF THE THIS THE WHEN DID INDIVIDUAL THAT WE HAVE FOR THE VETERAN THAT WE HAVE.

ON HIS LAP YOU KNOW AND AND THE VETERAN PETS A DOG AND IT'S IT IT DOES REALLY WORK IN THEM. I'VE TALKED TO SEVERAL OF OUR VETERANS IN OUR COMMUNITY AND IT DOES WORK AND IN IT IS A GREAT ALTERNATIVE TO MEDICATION WHICH IS NOT VERY BENEFICIAL TO SOME OF OUR VETERANS. SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I'D LIKE TO MOVE. THANK YOU ANY OTHER COMMENT. OF CENTER LABOR AND WALKING WITH LOW. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT WE ALL TALK ABOUT DOING SOMETHING FOR VETERANS WE ALL TALK ABOUT WANTING TO HELP AND SOMETIMES IT CAN SEEM A LITTLE UNWIELDY BUT THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS AND SO MANY ISSUES. TO ME THIS SEEMS LIKE SOMETHING THAT WE CAN ALL DO WE CAN ALL PARTICIPATE IN YOU'VE HEARD EXCELLENT TESTIMONY ON HOW THESE DOGS CAN BE LIFE CHANGING. OR THINK THE GENTLEMAN WHO SPOKE IN SUPPORT AND I THINK HE EXEMPLIFIED EXACTLY WHY WE NEED THIS BILL WE CAN'T JUST CONTINUE TO PRESCRIBE MEDICATIONS TO OUR VETERANS WHEN THERE'S A BETTER WAY WHEN WE CAN HAVE A SERVICE DOG WE CAN HAVE AN ANIMAL. AND REALLY IT'S INCUMBENT ON ALL OF US WHO DIDN'T SERVE WE ENJOY THE FREEDOM THAT WE ENJOY BECAUSE OF OUR VETERANS AND IF WE CAN'T FIND A WAY TO HELP THEM COMMON TRANSITION BACK AND HAVE A SUCCESSFUL LIFE.

SB THREE SIX FOUR GO AHEAD MAKE YOUR PRESENTATION THANK YOU ON A ROLL CHAIR ARE TO LET AND MEMBERS I AM VERY HAPPY TO PRESENT SB. THREE SIXTY FOUR A PROBLEM THAT IS CURRENTLY PLAGUING CALIFORNIA IS OUR AMOUNT OF VETERANS WHO ARE HOMELESS. IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN CALIFORNIA HAD TEN THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED AND THIRTY SIX HOMELESS VETERANS EQUATING TO ALMOST 30% OF THE NATION'S TOTAL HOMELESS VETERAN POPULATION. VETERANS OF SACRIFICE SO MUCH FOR OUR COUNTRY AND RETURN LOCAL STATE AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENTS NEED TO DO. EVERYTHING IN THEIR POWER TO HELP THEM SUCCEED. THERE IS NO SINGLE SOLUTION THAT'S GOING TO SOLVE THIS CRISIS REASONS FOR THE LARGE NUMBER OF HOMELESS VETERANS ARE NUMEROUS AND VERY COMPLEX. TO THE BIGGEST FACTORS ARE THE EXTREME SHORTAGE OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND A LIVABLE INCOME. SB THREE SIXTY FOUR ATTEMPTS TO ADDRESS THESE PROBLEMS OF VETERANS FACED BY DOING THE FOLLOWING. FIRST SB THREE SIXTY FOUR WILL CAP THE PROPERTY TAXES ON THE PRIMARY RESIDENCE OF AN HONORABLY DISCHARGED VETERAN OVER THE AGE OF SIXTY FIVE SECOND. IT EXEMPTS THE PROPERTY TAX ON ALL 1100% DISABLED VETERANS LIVING IN THEIR PRIMARY RESIDENCE. TWELVE OTHER STATES ALREADY HONOR THE VETERANS WITH FULL PROPERTY TAX EXEMPTIONS LET'S MAKE CALIFORNIA THE NEXT TO DO SO. SB THREE SIXTY FOUR PROVIDES A BASIC STEP IN HELPING OUR VETERAN COMMUNITY. BY EXPANDING THE CURRENT PROPERTY TAX EXEMPTION AND CURRENT REACH OF THE LAW CALIFORNIA'S HONORING THE SACRIFICES OF OUR VETERANS AND PROVIDED THEM WITH A WAY FOR THEM TO SUCCESSFULLY STAY IN THEIR HOMES. THIS BILL IS A REPEAT OF SB. FOR WHICH PASSED UNANIMOUSLY OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE LAST YEAR.

THANK YOU -- SENATOR MORALE YEARS YES -- SB FIVE SIX TO GO IN YOUR BILL THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS WELL GOOD AFTERNOON -- FIVE SIXTY TWO WILL INCREASE THE CURRENT -- PROPERTY TAX EXEMPTIONS FOR DISABLED VETS. MANNER. UNMARRIED -- SURVIVING SPOUSES. THE PURPOSE OF THIS BILL IS TO ENSURE THE EXEMPTIONS WE PROVIDETO THE VETERANS TO KEEP UP WITH THE COST OF HOUSING. AND LIVING IN A VERY EXPENSIVE CALIFORNIA. FOR VETERAN LIVING ONLY ON DISABILITY PENSION CAN BE DIFFICULT TO AFFORD THE RISING. COST OF HOUSING SO CURRENTLY -- MONTHLY TAKE HOME FOR QUALIFYING -- DISABLED VETS WITH THE PENANCES APPROXIMATE THIRTY THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS. ACCORDING TO THE PUBLIC POLICY INSTITUTE I THINK WE ALL KNOW THE MEDIAN HOME VALUE IN CALIFORNIA'S -- ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED FORTY SIX THOUSAND OR ABOUT TWENTY SEVEN HUNDRED DOLLARS PER MONTH. AT MINIMUM THE PROPERTY TAX FOR HOME. OF THAT COST WILL STILL EXCEED FIVE THOUSAND PER YEAR SO THERE'S CLEARLY A BIG GAP BETWEEN THE TAKE HOME PAY AND THE COST OF A HOME AT IN -- AT THE CURRENT HOUSING PRICES A TAXES ALONG. CANADA'S AS WE KNOW CAN BE OVERWHELMING SO WITH THIS BILL A DISABLED VETERAN WITH THE TENANTS AND NO OTHER INCOME WOULD BE ENTITLED TO THE LOW INCOME EXEMPTION. WOULD YOU BE REYES FROM TWO HUNDRED AND 200-022-0050 THOUSAND A VETERAN WITH A HOUSEHOLD INCOME OVER SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND FOR YOUR WOULD SEE AN INCREASE FROM.

A TOTAL AMOUNT OF PRIME CONTRACTOR RECEIVED UNDER THE CONTRACT. AND WOULD LIKE TO POINT OUT OFTENTIMES. THE MAJOR CONTRACTOR. WE'LL FIND A SUBCONTRACTOR WHO HAS VETERANS WITHIN THEIR RANKS AND USE THAT VETERAN. AS THE AS THE LOOP I WILL WE'LL CALL IT THE THE SUPPORTING FACTOR WHEN IN REALITY. THAT BETTER AND HAS NO KNOWLEDGE THAT HIS NAME WAS BEING USED AND HIS SERVICE. CHAU ONE BEING THE SUBCONTRACTOR IN THE OTHER. SHOW THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF PRIME CONTRACTOR RECEIVED UNDER THE CONTRACT. MUST BE DISCLOSED THE AMOUNT EACH OF DEPARTMENT OF WERE -- EACH SUBCONTRACTOR RECEIVED FROM THE PRIME CONTRACTOR AND THAT ALL PAYMENTS OLD UNDER THE CONTRACT HAVE BEEN MADE AND PICK MADE PAYABLE TO THE D. B. B. E.. THESE SUBCONTRACT PAYMENTS RECORDS ARE IMPORTANT IN MEASURING THE PROGRAM GOAL. ATTAINED. POTENTIAL OF PROGRAMS WASTE AND FRAUD IN THAT IS THE PRIMARY ISSUE. THE WASTE IN THE FRAUD FURTHERMORE EXISTING LAW IMPOSES SEVERE FINANCIAL PENALTIES AND CIVIL LIABILITIES. ON ANYONE WHO KNOWINGLY PROVIDE FALSE INFORMATION IN MAKING THE CERTIFICATION. THE VETERANS MUST NOT BE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF IN TWENTY FOURTEEN AND TWENTY NINETEEN FALLING OUT ITS OF THE D. B. B. E. PROGRAM THE STATE ATER REPORTED THAT MANY. CONTRACT AWARDED DEPARTMENTS. ARE DOING A WRETCHED JOB IN ACQUIRING AND MAINTAINING CERTIFICATIONS. OF THESE APPROVED -- BETTER AND SUBCONTRACTORS AND THE PAYMENTS MADE TO THEM. SO. WHEN A VETERAN IS IS UTILIZED HE THE SUBCONTRACTORS TO RECEIVE HIS PAYMENTS? OF FOR THE WORK DONE AND HIS INVOLVEMENT IN OFTENTIMES. PAYMENTS ARE NEVER MADE. IN ITS FALSIFICATIONS AND FALL CERTIFICATION. WHILE EXISTING LAW PROHIBITS I'M SORRY WE'RE EXISTING LAW PROVIDES SERIOUS PENALTIES FOR PRIME CONTRACTORS WHO KNOWINGLY PROVIDE FALSE INFORMATION. TO AN AWARDING DEPARTMENT REGARDING AS PAYMENTS TO SUBCONTRACTED THERE IS NO CORRESPONDING PENALTY FOR PRIME CONTRACTORS SIMPLY FAILING TO PROVIDE THE INFORMATION AT ALL. AND THIS WILL OPEN THAT DOOR TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT -- MAIN PRIME CONTRACTOR AND HIS INFORMATION IS IS CERTIFIED AND IT IS TRUE. THE THE LACK OF ENFORCEMENT TOOL. FOR CONTRIBUTED TO THIS DATA IS -- IS THE AWARDING OF SO MANY CONTRACTS WHICH OBVIOUSLY BELIEVES THAT. THAT SUBCONTRACT OUT SUBCONTRACTOR OUT OF THE EQUATION. SUBCONTRACTORS HAVE INFORMED. I AND MY STAFF THAT THEY ARE BEING -- UNDER USED AND AND UNDER PAID AND IN SOME CASES THEY ARE EVEN IT LISTED. ON THE D. B. B. E. BIDS. BY PRIME CONTRACTORS WITHOUT EVEN BEING INFORMED AS I HAD MENTIONED OR BEING NOTIFIED SO THESE VETERANS ARE ACTUALLY BEING USED IN TAKING TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF SB FIVE EIGHTY EIGHT CREATION ENFORCEMENT DOORS FOLLOWED. WHEN A PRIME CONTRACTOR FAILED TO REPORT US UP REPORTS SUBCONTRACTOR PAYMENTS? THE AWARDING DEPARTMENT WOULD BE REQUIRED TO NOTIFY THE CONTRACTOR FROM AND GIVE IT A REASONABLE TIME TO REPORT THE DATA. AND FOR A CONTRACTOR THAT FAILED TO RESPOND -- TO PROMPTING -- WITHIN A REASONABLE TIME. THE FIRST TIME PENALTY IS A FIVE YEAR SUSPENSION FOR PARTICIPATING IN THE PROGRAM RELATED TO CONTRACTS FOR VETERANS. A SECOND VIOLATION EARNED PERMANENT SUSPENSION. THE SUSPENSION FROM ALLSTATE RELATED CONTRACTS. CONTRACT PERTAINING TO THE STATE A VERY LUCRATIVE AND IT SHOULD BE WITH VETERANS IN MIND. IT NOT BEING TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF OUR FIRST ASSUMPTION IS THAT ALL PRIME CONTRACTORS EVERYWHERE MAINTAIN RECORDS OF THEIR PAYMENTS TO SUBCONTRACTORS. JUST FOR THE GENERAL BUSINESS MANAGER AND TAX PURPOSES. THEY HAVE THE DATA AND MUST BE A TRANSPARENT. OUR SECOND ASSUMPTION. PORT PAYMENT MAYBE DUE TO SIMPLE FORGETFULNESS OR BENIGN AIR. BUT FAILURE TO REPORT. THESE -- PAYMENTS OR LACK OF PAYMENT SHOULD BEING REMINDED AND GIVEN REASONABLE TIME TO INDICATE WILLFUL INTENT TO AVOID DISCLOSING DATA. WHICH WOULD HURT THE VETERANS. DATA THAT MIGHT INDICATE THAT CONTRACTORS UNDER AS AS BEING UNDER PAID OR NOT PAID AT ALL AND SOME CAGES AND THE SUBCONTRACTOR IS BEING USED -- AND WE MUST STOP THAT TYPE OF OF ACTION MUST PLUG THE DATA LIEU POSTED SO WE CAN ANALYZE THE PROGRAM PROPERLY -- WITH ME TODAY I HAVE DRAKE MATT AND MANY MARTINEZ TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT A RETREAT EIFFEL. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR GENTLEMEN WE REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR TESTIMONY TODAY WE HAVE FIVE MINUTES BETWEEN ALL OF YOU THIS OF TEARS RULES. I'LL START OFF THE DISABLED VETERAN BUSINESS PROGRAM WAS ESTABLISHED IN. NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE TWO GLARING MISTAKES IN. OUR THINGS LEFT OUT OF THE BILL AT THAT TIME. ONE WAS WHAT WE CALLED THE GOOD FAITH EFFORT WHERE THE CONTRACTOR COULD GO OUT AND SHOP THREE DIFFERENT -- VENUES AND IF YOU DIDN'T GET A DISABLED THAT THAT HE DIDN'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT. THE ONE THAT -- SENATOR ARCHULETA BROUGHT UP IS THE ONE THAT IS BEEN THE MOST TROUBLING. I CAN GIVE YOU A PERSONAL EXPERIENCE IT'S GOING ON RIGHT NOW WE HAVE A CONTRACT WITH PARSONS. TRANSPORTATION. IT'S A THREE HUNDRED ELEVEN THOUSAND DOLLAR CONTRACT. IS AND IT'S A CALTRANS LA METRO JOINT POLICY OR JOINT BID. AND THEY HAVE SAID THAT THEY WOULD BE USING US AND THEY HAVE NEVER USED TO US WE HAVE A SIGNED CONTRACT FROM THEM THERE IS NO PUNISHMENT FOR THEM FOR NOT USING US. THEY ARE GUEST SHINING US ON AND THAT'S THE ROBLEM THAT WE HAVE WITH THIS. SITUATION THAT'S GOING ON RIGHT WE NEED TO PUT TEETH INTO IT THIS WILL PUT TEETH IN. WE NEED THAT TO PROTECT THE VETERANS PROTECT THE VETERAN BUSINESS ENTERPRISES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. ANOTHER THING THAT CAME OUT THE AUDIT SHOWED THAT THERE WAS ONLY A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF THE VETERAN ARE DISABLED VETERAN OWNED BUSINESSES. THAT WE'RE GETTING MOST OF THE WORK IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THE AUDIT IS AN ACCURATE BECAUSE IT DOES NOT LOOK AT SUBCONTRACTING WE DO SUBCONTRACTING EXCLUSIVELY WE ARE NOT A PRIME CONTRACTOR. IF THAT INFORMATION WAS PUT INTO THAT AUDIT IT WOULD SHOW THAT THIS PROGRAM IS DOING FANTASTIC. WHAT WE NEED IS THE T. IN THIS BILL TO GET IT THROUGH TO ENFORCE THOSE PRIME CONTRACTORS TO DO WHAT'S RIGHT? IN THE CONSTRUCTION SIDE THEY HAVE REGULATIONS THAT ENFORCE THAT BUT NOT FOR THE DISABLED VETERANS SO WE NEED TO HAVE THAT DONE THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR AND ALL OF YOU. THANK YOU DRAKE -- I ALSO HAVE BEEN. A VICTIM OF THIS -- THIS ABUSE.

WITHOUT TELLING US AND WE THERE'S NO WAY FOR US TO KNOW YOU KNOW WHETHER THE BILL AS ARE THE WEATHER THAT'S BEEN AWARDED OR NOT TO TO TOUCH POINT -- SO THIS OVERSIGHT WE'LL GIVE YOU THAT VISIBILITY AND WE'LL SHOW YOU HOW THIS PROGRAM IS DRIVING BUSINESS IT'S KEEPING MONEY HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND HIRING CALIFORNIA.

THANK YOU MEMBERS THANK YOU CHAIR -- FIRST OF ALL I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE CHAIR -- FOR BEING A CO AUTHOR I APPRECIATE THAT. SENATE BILL SIX SIXTY THREE PROVIDES A PROPERTY TAX EXEMPTION FOR PROPERTY OWNED BY A VETERAN ORGANIZATION. CURRENT LAW ALLOWS A WELFARE EXEMPTION FOR PROPERTY TAXES FOR NON PROFITS IS JUST RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATIONS HOSPITALS AND VETERAN ORGANIZATIONS. HOWEVER THIS EXEMPTION ONLY APPLIES TO PORTIONS OF THE PROPERTY USED EXCLUSIVELY FOR CHARITABLE PURPOSES. SUCH AS ROOMS USED FOR COUNSELING SERVICES. THIS BILL WILL EXTEND THE PROPERTY TAX EXEMPTION TO ALL PARTS OF THE PROPERTY EXCEPT -- BAR. SB SIX SIXTY THREE WILL PROVIDE SUPPORT TO VETERANS HALLS THAT ARE TRYING TO ENHANCE THE SOCIAL WELFARE. OF CURRENT AND FORMER MILITARY PERSONNEL. THIS BILL IS IDENTICAL TO ASSEMBLY MEN. GRAZE BILL FROM LAST SESSION WHOM I'M ALSO PROUD TO HAVE AS A PRINCIPAL CO AUTHOR.

ASSISTANCE WITH APPLYING FOR BENEFITS AND VETERAN OUTREACH MANY VETERAN HOLES OPERATE ON A SMALL BUDGET MADE UP LARGELY OF DONATIONS AND THE VETERANS MEMBERSHIP DUES. FOR EXAMPLE MY POST HAS A SMALL BUDGET FOR SUPPORTING VETERANS. IN THE COMMUNITY IF F. F. SB SIX SIX THREE IS SIGNED INTO LAW. IT WOULD SAVE MY POST APPROXIMATELY SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR AND THOSE FUNDS COULD BE SHIFTED TO BETTER SUPPORT VETERANS IN THE COMMUNITY. VETERANS HALLS ALSO SERVE A PUBLIC AND CIVIC FUNCTION COMMUNITY. COMMUNITY MEETINGS BOY SCOUT FUNCTIONS. AND A HOST OF OTHER COMMUNITY GROUPS UTILIZING THE VETERAN HALL. THE CALIFORNIA SAYS HIS ASSOCIATION IS IN SUPPORT OF THIS LEGISLATION AND HAS STATED.

THE BILL WELL IT WAS CHAIR I'M HAPPY TO MOVE THE BILL AS ONE MAKE SURE THAT I'M CLEAR THE THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS THAT WE WERE. HANDED SIMPLY ADD COHEN RIGHT. RIGHT. AND HAVE THESE ARE AS A BILL ALREADY BEEN AMENDED OR IS IT GOING TO THESE MEN IN THE BILL IN COMMITTEE. OKAY -- MOVE THE BILL -- WITH THESE AMENDMENTS. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER COMMENT YES HELLO THIS CALL OF THE ROLL. SENATE BILL SIX SIX THREE TO PASS AS AMENDED BUT FIRST THROUGH REFERRED PREPARATIONS ARCHULETA. I I GREW GROUP I BOTTOM. NIELSEN. ROTH HI ROTH AYE NUMBER. NUMBER I WILK [inaudible] FOR GONNA HOLD IT OVER A CLOSING COMMENT. WELL I'VE GOT THE VOTES OF THANK YOU VERY MUCH [inaudible] REGULATIONS [inaudible] THREE EVEN [inaudible] WHAT'S THE SENATOR UMBERG YOU'D HAVE -- BILL SB. FOUR EIGHTY ONE AHEAD PRESENT YOUR BILL. THANK YOU -- THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF COURSE SOME HOUSEKEEPING MEASURES. THERE WERE SOME PROPOSED AMENDMENTS THAT WE WORKED WITH THE STAFF BY THE WAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH YOUR STAFF CHIEF CONSULTANT HAS BEEN QUITE. HELPFUL IN SPENT QUITE A BIT OF TIME WORKING OUT. THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS -- ONE EXCEPTION TO THAT IS THE AMENDMENT. THAT IS CONTAINED AT IN SECTION. THREE FIFTY SIX ONE HE IS AN BROUGH. OF THAT AMENDMENT WHAT WHAT ARE YOU ARE YOU ON PAGE UP UNDER THE PROPOSED SUBSTANTIVE AMENDMENTS IF YOU LOOK AT PAGE -- ALL RIGHT OFF OF IT SAYS PAGE. ELEVEN YOU SEE THAT AND THEN THERE'S A PARAGRAPH. SOME DE. ON PAGE ELEVEN OF THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS [inaudible] SURE. PAGE. FIVE SOCIAL RULES [inaudible] SECTION. THREE MORE ON THE YEAH. YEAH BUT WHAT ABOUT. OKAY. SO -- WE WE ACCEPT ALL THOSE AMENDMENTS ALL THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS -- THE ONE ISSUE THAT REALLY IS BEFORE US IS WITH RESPECT TO WHAT'S KNOWN AS A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION. PURPOSES BILLS TO FULL FIRST FIRST PURPOSE IS TO ENSURE THAT FOR EXAMPLE ALLEGATIONS CONCERNING -- SENIOR MILITARY OFFICIALS WITHIN THE MILITARY DEPARTMENT. GO TO THE GOVERNOR ULTIMATELY TO THE GOVERNOR WHO IS COMMANDER IN CHIEF OF THE OF THE CALIFORNIA NATIONAL GUARD AND STATE MILITARY DEPARTMENT. THAT'S ONE ISSUE I THINK THAT ISSUE HAS BEEN. AT LEAST IN TERMS OF CONTROVERSY IT HAS BEEN RESOLVED THE SECOND THOUGH IS AN ISSUE CONCERNING EQUALITY. IT'S EQUALITY WITH RESPECT -- TO IT MEANT OF SERVICE MEMBERS. IN THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN ACCUSED OF HARMING SERVICE MEMBERS AND HOW THEY'RE TREATED. SO. JUST TO ILLUSTRATE THE POINT. IF YOU HAVE TO INDIVIDUALS ONE INDIVIDUAL WHO IS IN UNIFORM WHO IS ON STATE ACTIVE DUTY. AND THAT INDIVIDUAL -- FOR EXAMPLE HARASSES ANOTHER INDIVIDUAL. SERVICE MEMBER. THAT INDIVIDUAL CURRENTLY IS PROTECTED BY WHAT'S KNOWN AS THE FAIRS STOCKTON WHICH IN EFFECT PROVIDES IMMUNITY. TO THE PERSON WHO IS ACCUSED OF HARASSING THE OTHER SERVICE MEMBERS. NOW JUXTAPOZ THAT TO SOMEONE WHO IS SITTING RIGHT NEXT TO HIM OR HER. RIGHT NEXT TO THE ACCUSER WHO IS ENGAGED IN THE EXACT SAME CONDUCT BUT AS A CIVILIAN. IF THAT PERSON IS A CIVILIAN ENGAGES IN THE EXACT SAME CONDUCT. THEN THE VICTIM OR THE PURPORTED VICTIM OF THAT HARASSMENT. AS AN ABILITY TO SEEK CIVIL REDRESS. SO WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS THIS BILL DOES IN THE CONSEQUENCE IN THE CIRCUMSTANCE WHERE YOU HAVE A WHISTLE BLOWER. WHERE THE WHISTLE BLOWER HAS MADE AN ALLEGATION THE BILL PROVIDES GOOD FAITH ALLEGATION? MAKES AN ALLEGATION AGAINST ANOTHER SERVICE MEMBER. TO THE EXTENT THAT THAT THEY ARE RETALIATED GETS TO THE EXTENT THAT THEY ARE HARMED. THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO SEEK CIVIL REDRESS JUST LIKE IF THE PERSON WHO WAS ACCUSED OF THAT HARM. WERE CIVILIAN -- THE PROTECTIONS PROVIDED BY THE FAIRS DOCTOR AND WHICH IS A A DOCTRINE THAT THE OF ALL FROM A CASE OF THE UNITED STATES FERS FERRIS. IN. NINETEEN FIFTY HAS BEEN REBUKED NEARLY UNIVERSALLY. EVEN. JUSTICE ANTONIN SCALIA. WHEN REFERRING TO AFFAIRS DR THAT'S THE DOCTOR AGAIN THAT THAT PROTECTS AND IMMUNIZE IS IN ESSENCE MILITARY MEMBERS? SAID THE FOLLOWING SAID FAIRS VERSUS UNITED STATES WAS WRONGLY DECIDED AND HARDLY DESERVES THE WIDESPREAD AND ALMOST UNIVERSAL CRITICISM IT IS RUN RISK IT IS RECEIVED. THIS ISSUE CONCERNING THE FAIRS DOCTRINE IS RIGHT NOW. BEING CONSIDERED FOR REVIEW BY THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT WE ANTICIPATE THAT ANY DAY ANY DAY THE SUPREME COURT WILL DECIDE WHETHER GOING TO TAKE UP THIS ISSUE -- IF. IT'S BEEN SAID IN THE PAST IS PROLOGUE. BY A NUMBER OF COMMENTATORS BOTH CONSERVATIVE AND THOSE WERE NOT CONSERVATIVE. THEN I I EXPECTED THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT WILL TAKE UP. IN RESPECT OF A WHERE THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT TAKES UP THIS. WHAT I BELIEVED TO BE -- THIS IMPROPER. IMMUNIZATION OF MILITARY MEMBERS WHO HAVE ENGAGED IN MISCONDUCT IRRESPECTIVE OF WHETHER TAKE IT UP WITH THIS BILL THIS PARTICULAR PROVISION THIS. ONE AMENDMENT THIS ONE PROVISION OF THIS AMENDMENT THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. THEN. WOULD ESTABLISH A CALIFORNIA BASICALLY ONCE AGAIN IS IN THE FOREFRONT OF PRINT PROVIDING PROTECTIONS FOR THOSE WHO ARE WHISTLE BLOWERS. HAVING SAID THAT I HAVE NUMBER OF EXPERTS I'M MERELY HERE IS THE AUTHOR OF NUMBER OF EXPERTS HERE. TO TESTIFY -- WITH RESPECT TO THE IMPACTS OF THE BILL IN PARTICULAR CONCERNING THE THE MOMENT THAT IS AT ISSUE OR THE PORTION MOMENT THAT THAT'S AT ISSUE. THAT DATA FIRES. THANK YOU. MY NAME IS TOM BARTH AND I AM -- COUNCIL WORKING WITH THE NATIONAL GUARD ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA -- MY BACKGROUND BRIEFLY IS -- WEST POINT GRAD OF NINETEEN SEVENTY NINE I SERVE TWELVE YEARS ACTIVE DUTY AND THEN RETIRED FROM CALIFORNIA NATIONAL GUARD. MOST OF MY TIME ACTIVE DUTY AND GUARD WAS AS A JAG ATTORNEY. AND SO I'VE FIVE DELTA -- FRANKLY ON THE MILITARY IN THE MILITARY CONTEXT TO A LIMITED EXTENT BUT DEFINITELY IN MY POST. RETIREMENT CIVILIAN PRACTICE -- WITH -- WITH VARIOUS ASPECTS OF THIS VARIES DOCTOR AND HOW IT'S HOW IT-- MANIFESTS SO ADDRESSING THIS PARTICULAR WHAT WHAT APPEARS TO BE. YOU KNOW THE FOCUS OF OF THE DISCUSSION OF FIFTY SIX POINT ONE A SUBDIVISION BE -- YEAH THIS THIS ISN'T ACTUALLY NEW -- FOR A STATE TO ALLOW -- A CIVIL -- PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION -- THE OTHER STATES -- OF NOTABLY ALASKA AND STATE WASHINGTON -- I HAVE GONE THIS ROUTE IN VARYING DEGREES I THINK WHAT'S KEY. TO ADDRESS THE UNDERSTANDABLE CONCERNS -- WITH RESPECT TO MILITARY GOOD ORDER AND DISCIPLINE IN THE FUNCTION AND OPERATION. OF THE MILITARY IS TO HAVE A VERY WELL DEFINED -- IN SPLIT AND SPECIFIC -- STANDARD -- BY WHICH A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION MAY BE INVOKED SO -- ARE. UNDERSTANDABLY IT SHOULD NOT BE -- FRANKLY AS IN ALASKA WHERE THEY CAN SUE FOR ANY MANNER OF NEGLIGENCE -- THIS ONE IS VERY SPECIFICALLY TAILORED IN ORDER TO ADDRESS AND IT CONCERNS THAT MAY BE QUITE UNDERSTANDABLE ABOUT -- DISRUPTION OF THE MILITARY -- PROCESS SO IT'S IT'S IT IS THOUGH RELATIVELY NEW AND NOVEL APPROACH BUT IT IS FUNDAMENTALLY -- AT THE ROCKET IF OF THE LEGISLATURE IN YOUR HANDS IN THE FIRST INSTANCE TO DECIDE. WHETHER AND TO WHAT EXTENT -- THIS -- PROTECTION OR OR OR SHROUD IF YOU WILL AGAINST ANY ACCOUNTABILITY OF MILITARY ACTORS -- IS LIFTED TO A TO A DEGREE -- SO WE GET THE IF THERE ANY QUESTIONS LIKE ADDRESS. THE OTHER REST. OF EXPERT WITNESSES [inaudible] CENTER. SURE MR MAS. THANK YOU SENATOR JOHN HER MOLLIS ALLEGEDLY DIRECT FOR THE NATIONAL GUARD ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIA SPENT. THREE DECADES IN THE DEPARTMENT -- WEHAVE WITNESSED A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER. COMPLAIN SAID WE HAVE BEEN PROVIDING ASSISTANCE WITH OUR OFFICE IN THE LAST. SIX OR SEVEN YEARS PRIMARILY AND HAVE BEEN HELPING FOR THOSE ON TO THE PROPER AUTHORITIES FOR A FINAL INVESTIGATION WHAT WE FIND THOUGH IS THAT. WE'RE A AS WE HELP MOVE SOME OF THESE THROUGH AND AND SEE THE CONCLUSION THAT IS. REACH WE FIND THAT THE WHISTLE BLOWERS ARE NOT REALLY PROTECTED ALL THIS PARTICULAR SYSTEM. THERE ARE WAYS TO ADVANCE A COMPLAINT IN THE STATE SYSTEM BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY THERE'S NO REQUIREMENT THAT ANYBODY TAKE ANY ACTION ON IT AND THAT CAN BE A SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM. SOMETIMES THE FEDERAL SYSTEM. PLEASE TAKE A LONG TIME TO INVESTIGATE AND THEY SIMPLY. GET FILED AWAY PEOPLE RETIRED PEOPLE LEAVE. AND NOTHING'S DONE EVEN IF THERE IS A FINDING OF THE VERY FEW-INSTANCES. SO THIS PARTICULAR. BILL IS DESIGNED TO ADDRESS WHAT WE SEE IS THAT IMPORTANT AS AS A DEFICIENCY IN THE STATE PROCESS -- AND IT WILL ALLOW PEOPLE TO HAVE A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION AND I THINK THIS IS THE BEST THING ABOUT THIS BILL IS IT KEEPS PEOPLE HONEST. THERE'S OTHER STATE AGENCIES THAT. HAVE THE SIMILAR TYPE OF ACTION AVAILABLE TO THEIR PLACE THEY HAVEN'T COLLAPSED UNDER THE SYSTEM AT ALL. AND THERE'S NO MULTIMILLION DOLLAR JUDGMENTS RUNNING AROUND THAT LAST TIME WE CHECKED WE SAW. THAT -- YOU KNOW THAT WOULD LEAD US TO CONCLUDE MAYBE THIS ISN'T THE BEST WAY TO DO IT. BUT IT DOES KEEP PEOPLE HONEST THAT IT AND IT TAKES THINGS OUT OF THE HANDS. OF A DEPARTMENT THAT RIGHT NOW IS IN CHARGE OF THE WHOLE PROCESS A PROVIDING REDRESS AND IT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE WORKING VERY EFFECTIVELY AT ALL MAJOR. MY STATEMENT IS IS THAT OKAY. YOU MAY YES I DO I JUST I HAVE EVERYTHING WRITTEN OUT AND JUST AND FEEL LIKE I WANT TO HAVE EVERYTHING -- EVERYBODY ENOUGH TIME OKAY OKAY I WOULD JUST LIKE. OKAY. MY NAME IS MAJOR TWENTY ONE I USED TO BE A FORMER MEMBER OF IT -- CALIFORNIA AIR NATIONAL GUARD RIDLEY FROM SAM CISCO ONE REYES THERE WENT TO UCLA GRADUATED WITH A BA IN WHEN THE STUDIES HAVE A LAW DEGREE FROM RECORDS I ALSO HAVE A SECOND LARGELY FROM GOING TO UNIVERSITY. AS PURSUING MY THIRD IN THE OUR STOCK ACTUALLY IT WAS MY DISSERTATION. EVERYTHING HAS BEEN SAID HERE IS ABSOLUTELY. SPOT ON RETALIATION IN THE CALIFORNIA SHUGART IS RAMPANT AND IT'S IT'S PRACTICING CONDONED BY. THE VERY TOP MAJOR GENERAL BALDWIN AND I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY HE'S STILL THERE. AND SO I ENCOURAGE YOU PLEASE PLEASE. TO SUPPORT THE SPELL BECAUSE LIVES HAVE BEEN RUINED -- NOT JUST A MILITARY PERSONNEL THE CIVILIANS AS WELL CIVILIANS HAVE LOST. THEIR HOUSES. BECAUSE OF US THEY WANT TO REPORT SOMETHING. YOU'RE GUARANTEED TO BE RETALIATED [inaudible] YOUR YOU'LL BE REMOVED FROM HER JOB ANY EVENTUALLY KICKED OUT I TESTIFIED AGAINST JOHN BALDWIN. SEVEN YEARS AGO AND ALL TOSE THINGS. THAT WERE. TO THE SENATE AT THAT AND STILL HAVEN'T BEEN FIXED. AND ALL THOSE PEOPLE THOSE TWELVE PEOPLE WHO WERE WHO -- TESTIFIED. WERE ALL KICKED OUT. ROB RETALIATED AGAINST AND NONE OF US THE MILITARY PERSONNEL NONE OF US GOT ANY. OPPORTUNITY. OF REPARATION. AND SO I HIGHLY ENCOURAGE YOU -- TO SUPPORT THIS PASS ANYONE IN THE AUDIENCE WOULD LIKE TO SUPPORT DOES THIS BILL PLEASE COME A MICROPHONE YES MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF MIKE MATIC -- CONSUMER WATCHDOG COUNSEL FOR THEM -- PRIOR TO THAT HONORABLY SERVED IN TWO BRANCHES OF OUR MILITARY AND HAVE -- RETIRED RECENTLY FROM THIRTEEN YEARS USA A VICE PRESIDENT SENIOR COUNSEL HERE IN SUPPORT OF THE MEASURE. IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT WE PROTECT. THOSE THAT HAVE THE COURAGE TO STAND UP. AND SAY WHAT'S WRONG. TO STAND UP AT A GREAT RISK TO THEMSELVES THE POINT OUT. MALFEASANCE MISFEASANCE. SEXUAL PREDATORS. AND PROFITEERING. IF WE CAN'T DO THAT. TO THESE PATRIOTS WELCOME TO TRUST ALSO LIKE TO THANK COLONEL ON BERG SENATOR UMBERG. FOR HAVING THE COURAGE TO BRING THIS BILL UP AGAIN HE HAS BEEN A A RANGER FOR JUSTICE IN THIS AREA FOR YEARS AND THAT WOULD LAST FOR YOUR-IPHONE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE IN THE AUDIENCE TO SUPPORT. ANYONE IN OPPOSITION. PLEASE ADDRESSED MICROPHONE CHART. DID YOU WANT. NO ONE ON THIS ISSUE YEAH OKAY IN OPPOSITION. OF CENTERS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. YOU KNOW AS I'VE INDICATED TO THE AUTHOR OF THE PROBLEM WITH THE WAY THIS IS BEEN PRESENTED. IS TYPICALLY BILLS ARE AMENDED COMING INTO COMMITTEE BY THE AUTHOR COMMITTEE. SEES THE HAS THE OPTION TO PROPOSE AMENDMENTS FROM THE DíAS THE RATHER ACCEPTED OR NOT. THIS IS RATHER SOMEONE USING TO DEAL WITH AN AMENDMENT COMING FROM THE OTHER DIRECTION NUMBER. ONE NUMBER TWO HAVING LOOKED AT IT IS IS IT MY UNDERSTANDING. OPPOSED AMENDMENT WITH RESPECT TO THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION. ONLY EXTENDS TO WHISTLEBLOWER REPRISAL. GENOM [inaudible] OKAY. IS IT NOT DOES IT EXTEND TO THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION EXTENDED TO THOSE ACCUSED. OF REAP OF REPRISAL. WHO WERE IN TITLE TEN STATUS? DOES IT EXTEND TO THOSE WHO WERE ACCUSED OF REPRISAL IN TITLE THIRTY TWO STATUS. IF ONLY IF THERE. ONLY IF THEY'RE ACTING IN THEIR STATE CAPACITY STATE PART OF THE STATE MILITIA BUT THEIR MOTHER THAT'S CONFUSING TO ME BECAUSE MY UNDERSTANDING IS TOTAL THIRTY TWO FEDERALLY FUNDED. STATE RELATED ACTIVITY FOR WHICH AN INDIVIDUAL RECEIVES FOR RETIREMENT CREDITS IS NOT NOT THE CASE -- IS GREATER SO TITLE THIRTY TWO TITLE. TEN PERFORMING THE SAME GENERAL TYPE OF DUTY DOES IT ALSO EXTEND TO THOSE ACCUSED OF REPRISAL WHO RUN STATE ACTIVE DUTY. IT IS ACTIVE SO YOU AND MY UNDERSTANDING IS OF AN INDIVIDUAL MALE OR FEMALE IN THE GUARD COULD BE ON TITLE TEN STATUS ONE WEEK FOR EXAMPLE. DEPENDING ON THE ORDERS AND AND HOW THEIR PHRASED AND MAYBE THE FUNDING SOURCE. AND THEN STATE IT CALLED THE STATE ACTIVE DUTY BY THE GOVERNOR ON THE STATE PAYROLL IF THERE IS A A RIDE OR SOME OTHER STATE ACTIVITIES NEEDS ATTENTION IS THAT CORRECT. THEY DID AND THAT YOU'RE RIGHT THERE ARE OFTEN MULTIPLE CAPACITIES SOURCE OR ONE OR TWO CAPACITIES THAT A PERSON'S ACTING IN AT A GIVEN TIME. SO. SO THE INDIVIDUAL WHO COULD BE POTENTIALLY. SUSCEPTIBLE TO A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION. DEPENDING ON THE STATUS IT THERE. WHEN THEY TAKE THEIR THEIR THAT ACTION CORRECT? SIR -- IT IS AS YOU POINTED OUT THAT'S THAT'S PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY THE ORDERS IN THE FUNDING SOURCE THAT CLEAR FROM THIS. THIS AMENDMENT IN B. I CAN'T TELL. AYE AYE THE SIR I WOULD OFFER THAT -- AS A STATE STATUTE IT CAN ONLY EXTEND ACTUALLY -- TO THE JURISDICTION OF THE STATE LEGISLATURE THE STATE. WAS IN THE MILITARY BETTER AT AS A JUST JUST RESPOND ESPERANZA POINT FOR POINT THAT AND WE WILL CLARIFY THAT TITLE. THIRTY TWO IF THERE'S DISCIPLINARY ACTION TAKEN HAS THAT TAKEN. SAID TAKEN IN THE STATE YOU SEEM STATE VERSION OF THE UCMJ OR UNDER THE UCMJ. IT'S THE THE STATE -- WELL YOU SEE A DAYS ADOPTED. BYE BYE. BUT YOUR DISCIPLINARY ACTION. TO THE EXTENT THE ME MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE ALL CLEAR TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE'S A A CRIME COMMITTED WHILE IN STATE ACTIVE DUTY STATUS. ONE WOULD BE COURT MARTIALED IN THE STATE SYSTEM VERSUS THE FEDERAL SYSTEM ALTHOUGH THE UC M. J. -- AS IMPLEMENTED BY THE STATE AS I UNDERSTAND IT IT IS. NEARLY IDENTICAL -- BUT THE PROSECUTION WOULD HAPPEN WITHIN THE STATE SYSTEM SO IT IS A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION ORDER CREW REQUIRE A SUBSTANTIATED. A I G. COMPLAINT FINDING TO THE EXTNT THAT AN IG COMPLAINT WAS AN ISSUE. SIR DOES NOT SO YOU COULD HAVE A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION AFTER YOU'VE HAD A STATE OR FEDERAL IG COMPLAINT. INVESTIGATION CONDUCTED AN UNSUBSTANTIATED COMPLAIN FINDING ISSUE. YES. I MEAN TO TO BE SPECIFIC JUST AS IF THE PERPETRATOR AT LEAST THE PURPORTED OR ALLEGE PERPETRATOR. WERE SOME MILLION. IF. THE CIVILIAN IF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL DIDN'T INSPECTION. THEN INVESTIGATION AND DETERMINED THAT THE CLAIM WAS UNFOUNDED. AND SOMEONE DECIDED TO FILE A CIVIL ACTION AGAINST THAT CIVILIAN MY UNDERSTAND WE'RE TALKING BUT MILITARY UNIFORMS. THEY COULD BUT JUST AND SIMILARLY AS TO SOMEONE WHO'S IN STATE ACTIVITY. BUT BUT YOUR POINT IS WELL TAKEN AND CERTAINLY WE CLARIFY HERE. THAT THIS PERTAINS TO STATE ACTIVE DUTY TO THE EXTENT THAT THE STOCK STILL EXIST. IN SHOULD SOMEONE FOR EXAMPLE THERE IS ONLY APPLIES TO TITLE. TEN ON ITS FACE YES YES AND IT HAS BEEN. ADDRESSED BY A STATE COURT DECISION AMONG OTHERS AS AS TO HOW IT IS TO BE INTERPRETED AND THAT'S THAT'S WRAPPED AROUND FEDERAL TORT CLAIMS ACT AND ALTERNATIVE BENEFITS AND DISABILITY BENEFITS AND THERE'S A LONG HISTORY WHETHER IT'S CORRECT OR NOT. AND WHETHER IT'S BEEN APPLIED% PROPERLY AND IT'S BEHIND THIS FERRIS ISSUE IN THESE FERRIES ARGUMENTS THAT ARE CURRENTLY PROBABLY GONNA BE ADDRESSED AGAIN. BY THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT THAT'S NOT. FAIRS DOESN'T APPLY TO SOMEONE IN STATE CORRECT ACTIVE DUTY STATUS WORKING A RIOT IN LOS ANGELES RIGHT [inaudible] OKAY SO. IF I MIGHT ANSWER THE EIGHT THAT DECISION ACTUALLY EVEN POINT OUT THE ESPYS VERSUS MONROE DECISION A ACTUALLY POINTED OUT OF THIRD DCA OPINION SACRAMENTO. THAT -- THEY WANT TO APPROACH THIS THE SAME WAY THE FAIRIES COURT ACTUALLY REACH THE ISSUE AND THAT WAS IN GREAT STERN BEGAN AND ENDED -- FUNDAMENTALLY WITH THE AND INTERPRETATION. OF THE STATUTORY SCHEME. BY LATE SO HAVE SWIMMING IS ONE OTHER QUESTION. SOMEBODY TELL E WHAT WHAT IS BROKEN ABOUT THE WHAT I THINK IS THE EXISTING SYSTEM. SO IF YOU HAVE A WHISTLE BLOWER OR REPRISAL CLIMB. DOESN'T THAT ULTIMATELY GO TO THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE. INSPECTOR GENERAL FOR A REPRISAL INVESTIGATION. CAN I JUST WOMAN FIVE IF IF YOU'RE QUALIFIED DANCE YES YES BECAUSE I'VE BEEN THROUGH IT. OKAY AND SO -- FIRST OF ALL I WANT YOU TO UNDERSTAND THAT NINETY NINE POINT 99% OF AYE TWO COMPLAINTS. ARE NEVER SUBSTANTIATED. EVER BECAUSE YOU HAVE THE FLOCK YOU HAVE. IF. YOU HAD ASKED THAT QUESTION EARLIER SO I JUST WANTED TO CLARIFY I I'D LIKE THE ANSWER TO THE QUESTION HAVING TO DO WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE. PROCESS. FOR ROOF IDYLLWILD SOMETHING I'VE FOUGHT WITH THE DOD IG WHICH I DID ARE THEY AUTOMATICALLY. REPORTED TO THE DOD INSPECTOR GENERAL IF IT INVOLVES. WHISTLE BLOWER AND REPRISAL ALLEGATIONS. ACTUALLY IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING OF THAT THIS. AMONG OTHER THINGS ACTUALLY AS A WHISTLEBLOWER REPRISAL ACT. BUT I MEAN YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH THE SYSTEM RIGHT. ARE THERE ARE WOULD WHISTLE BLOWER WHISTLE BLOWER AND REPRISAL ALLEGATIONS. DIRECTLY REPORTED. EITHER THROUGH THIS. STATE IG OR THE FEDERAL AYE INSPECTOR GENERAL HERE IN CALIFORNIA OR THE ADJUTANT GENERAL. TO THE DEPARTMENT TO THE IN THIS CASE I GUESS IT WOULD BE THE SECRETARY OF ARMY INSPECTOR GENERAL. AND THEN ON TO THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE IG FOR PURPOSES OF TRACKING REVIEW. APPROVAL BECAUSE OF THE SENSITIVITY OF REPRISAL CASES AS EARLY TO UNDERSTAND NOT NECESSARILY. IT IS REPORTED AYE I UNDERSTAND -- BUT AND CRACKED BUT THE INVESTIGATION AND BE ACTUALLY COMPLETED STRICTLY WITH. SO GIVEN THE FACT THAT THERE IS A PROCESS. THAT EXTENDS FROM THE STATE. OF THROUGH THE MILITARY DEPARTMENT PENTAGON. AND TO THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE WHAT'S BROKEN ABOUT THAT PROCESS -- I THINK THE OF MANIFESTATION IF I THINK IT MAY NOT BE BROKEN ON IT SPACE IN THE SENSE OF THE ARCHITECTURE OF IT SIR. YEAH BUT I MEAN THE ORIGINAL INTENT OF THE REGULATORY SCHEME. BUT I THINK WHAT WERE REFERRING TO AND WHAT THIS BILL IS DUE ADDRESSES THAT IS OUR ACTUALLY FUNCTION. IN A WAY THAT I THINK THE WITNESS WAS EXPRESSING FOR OUR OWN PERSPECTIVE. YOU KNOW WHAT ARE THE THE THE FAILURE TO ACTUALLY FUNCTION AS INTENDED. AND AND WHETHER THAT'S BECAUSE OF MILITARY OVERSIGHT TO COME HAVE AN I. G.'S BY THE ARMY REGULATIONS -- ARE REPORTABLE. AND REPORT DIRECTLY TO THE COMING. AND SO TO THE EXTENT THERE'S NOT A COMMAND -- WELL -- AND THE SUBORDINATE LEVEL THE PENTAGON THE IG WORKS WITH SECRETARY HAS CORRECT RIGHT AND ACTUALLY THAT IS A DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE FEDERAL ID. SYSTEM THERE ARE VARIOUS -- STANDARD FOR THE I NEED TO BE ABLE TO TAKE INDEPENDENT ACT OF THE D. O. D. COMMANDER -- WHICH DOESN'T EXIST AT STATE LEVEL SO THIS AT STATE LEVEL THE DATA THAT STATE IG -- ACTUALLY -- I I THINK EVEN THAT -- THE CASE OF OF MAJOR STERLING THAT -- EVERYONE MAY BE FAMILIAR WITH -- POINTED OUT THAT COURT I'VE GOT A COPY OF THAT I CAN READ THE BILL LANGUAGE POINT OUT THAT -- THE IN THE STATE I G. SYSTEM THE STATE I. G. -- REPRISAL COMPLAIN ONLY NEEDS TO DO THREE OF THE SEVEN ACID TESTS CORRECT WHEREAS THE DOD IG WOULD DO ALL SEVEN AND SO -- I THINK THAT THE ARCHITECTURE OF THE DAY YOU'RE GOING TO SERVE SEEMS LIKE IT WOULD BE COMPREHENSIVE. BUT THE ACTUAL -- IMPLEMENTATION THE THE ACT WILL PERFORMANCE OF WELL LET ME TELL YOU HERE'S MY PROBLEM. FROM MY PERSPECTIVE BEEN THERE MAY BE A WAY TO WORK AROUND THIS WITH RESPECT TO THOSE FOLKS WHO RUN THE STATE MILITIA WHO NEVER PERFORMED. TITLE TENER TITLE. THIRTY TO A DUTY. WHETHER THEY'RE VOLUNTEER OR THERE IF THERE ARE SOME THAT ARE PAID -- I HAVE A PROBLEM HAVING ONE PERSON THE SAME PERSON SUBJECT TO A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION OR NOT DEPENDING ON WHAT SET OF ORDERS THEY GET. AND WHO'S PAYING FOR THE DUTY. NUMBER ONE NUMBER TWO I HAVE A PROBLEM. SUBJECTING A MILITARY MEMBER TO A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION. WHEN IF THERE IS AN IG INVESTIGATION AND A REPORT THE INVESTIGATION FINDS THE COMPLAINT UNSUBSTANTIATED AND THEN WE SUBJECT THE MILITARY MEMBER TO AN OUTSIDE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION IN A SUPERIOR COURT WITH A WHOLE BUNCHOF ATTORNEYS? AND I'VE AS THE OFF THROUGH THE QUESTION IN THE FACE OF AN UNSUBSTANTIATED FINDING BY A IG STATE OR FEDERAL WOULD NOT THE STATE HAVE AN OBLIGATION AT THAT POINT TO AT LEAST PROVIDE A DEFENSE. IF NOT AN INDEMNITY DEPENDING ON THE RESULT -- IN THE DEPENDING ON THE RESULTS I HAVE A PROBLEM ON THOSE TWO LEVELS -- I THINK ULTIMATELY -- IN A DIFFERENT SETTING WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO WORK THIS OUT SO THAT -- THE OFFICERS THE YOUNG OFFICERS CONCERNS ARE ADDRESSED YOU KNOW UNFORTUNATELY THERE ARE. MANY PEOPLE AROUND THE MILITARY SYSTEM WHO RUN SATISFIED BY IG. INVESTIGATIONS IN THE MOST SENSITIVE CASES OBVIOUSLY WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PROCESS WORKS. BUT THE INSPECTOR GENERAL'S DO THEIR JOB FREE OF INFLUENCE BY ANYBODY -- AND APPROPRIATE DISCIPLINARY ACTION IS TAKEN AND WE FROM MY PERSPECTIVE AT SOME POINT WE CAN REVISIT THIS PRIDE OF RIGHT OF ACTION. UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES I THAT I'VE OUTLINED WHICH IS FROM MY PERSPECTIVE I DON'T SPEAK FOR THE CHAIR. BUT WERE YOU TALK ABOUT STRICTLY STATE PEOPLE DOING STRICTLY STATE STUFF WHO DON'T CROSS OVER AND THE TITLE TEN TITLE THIRTY TWO AREA. PERFORM MILITARY MISSIONS UNDER THE FEDERAL PAYROLL FOR FOR RETIREMENT. AND THAT'S ACTUALLY -- WELL WHY IN MY OPENING COMMENTS ARE I I WAS I SUGGEST I THINK -- THE THE BEST APPROACH BUT AS PRIDE RIGHT RIGHT OF ACTION IS TO DEFINE IT. SEPARATELY SO THAT IT WOULD ADDRESS THOSE VERY CONCERNS AND I THINK THAT CAN BE DONE FRANKLY EVEN BY -- AMENDMENTS TO THIS LINE CHAU I'M NOT SURE THIS IS THE RIGHT PLACE YOUR TIME BUT THOSE ARE MY COMMENTS THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU M. THANK YOU GENERAL VERY MUCH FOR DOING THAT I REALLY APPRECIATE YOU ANSWERED A LOT OF QUESTIONS. AT THAT GENERAL THIRD SENATOR ROTH HAD ASKED REGARDING THE I. G. IN THE APPEAL PROCESS TO THE DOD AND REGARDING TITLE THIRTY THIRTY TWO ENTITLED TEN SO I APPRECIATE THOSE QUESTIONS SO -- I'D LIKE TO TAKE IT A STEP FURTHER THAN WHAT SENATOR ROTH DID -- AND IDENTIFY LANGUAGE IT SAYS. YOU KNOW STATE PEOPLE AT STATE TIME EXCLUSIVELY AND STATE PEOPLE ITS STATE TIME YOU'RE STILL IMPLEMENTING A PRIVATE RIGHT ACTION AGAINST A MILITARY SERVICE MEMBER. WHO HAS BEEN CLEARED OR HAS AN AND SINCE AND SHE TO CLAIM FROM THE IG? AND IS THAT THE INTENT OF YOUR BILL [inaudible] WELL. A COUPLE ITEMS HERE. OFFERS LET ME RESPOND TO SENATOR OFF YOUR SERVICER OFF YOU'VE YOU'VE REYES GOOD POINTS -- AND AND SO. IN WHAT WAYS THE I HAVE BEEN HAVE BEEN HERE LONG ENOUGH THAT SO FAR ALL GOOD POINTS -- IN TERMS OF FURTHER DEFINITION YOUR POINT'S WELL TAKEN IN AND TO THE EXTENT THAT THE COMMITTEE ALLOWS US TO GO FORWARD. WE WILL DRILL DOWN TO DEFINE WHERE THAT PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION. CAN BE IMPLEMENTED CERTAINLY IT DOESN'T -- IF SOMEONE'S PROTECT BY THE FAIRS DOCTRINE THEY ALLEGE THAT IN THEIR PROTECTED TO THE EXTENT THAT SOMEONE IS CLEARED BY THE INSPECTOR GENERAL YOUR QUESTION. CENTER ROAD SYSTEM DIXON SOMEONE'S CLEARED BY THE INSPECTOR GENERAL. OF JUST AS A CIVILIAN YOU CAN FILE I MEAN YOU YOU CAN FILE A LAWSUIT AGAINST THE PERSON IF YOU THINK THE INSPECTOR GENERAL HAS DONE. EITHER AN INCOMPLETE INADEQUATE OR DIDN'T COVER ALL THE BASES AND YOU THINK YOU'VE STILL BEEN WRONG AND YOU'VE BEEN DAMAGED IT'S WORTH IT TO YOU TO ACTUALLY MOVE FORWARD AND YOU FIND A COUNCIL. IT'S WORTH IT FOR HIM OR HER TO TO EITHER. PUT THEIR TIME ON THE LINE TO GO FORWARD. THEN JUST AS IT WERE WITH THE CIVILIAN YOU CAN MOVE OR I THINK IT'S UNLIKELY BUT BUT WE SHOULDN'T PROVIDE I MY VIEW WE SHOULD NOT PROVIDE. THE PROTECTION FOR SOMEONE WHO HARASSES LET ME JUST GIVE YOU A SPECIFIC EXAMPLE. OF SOMEONE URINATES IN SOMEONE ELSE'S BOOTS FOR THE PURPOSE OF INTIMIDATING THEM. AND THEN IT'S REPORTED THAT THERE IS AN ISSUE WITH RESPECT TO THE COMMAND. PERSON WEATHER IS THE PERSON WHO'S BOOT SAID BEEN URINATED UPON OR WHETHER IT'S ANOTHER PERSON WHO'S TRYING. TO UNRAVEL WHATEVER'S GOING ON THE COMMAND THAT WOULD. PROVIDE FOR THAT ENVIRONMENT. IN THEIR RETALIATE AGAINST THE PERSON WHO DOES THE RETALIATION MERELY BECAUSE THEY'RE IN A UNIFORM SHOULD NOT BE GIVEN ANY GREATER PROTECTIONS. THEN A CIVILIAN. EIGHT OFFICER IN THE MILITARY NON COMMISSIONED OFFICER OR ENLISTED PERSON WHO HARASSES AND I'M GONNA SAY A WOMAN SHOULD NOT BE PROTECTED. ANY MORE THAN A CIVILIAN. THEY SHOULD FACE THE SAME CIVIL CONSEQUENCES NOW THE INSPECTOR GENERAL CONCLUDES THAT THERE WAS NO WRONGDOING MY GUESS IS THEY DON'T FILE LAWSUITS BUT IF THE PERSON BELIEVES THAT THEY'RE SOMEHOW INADEQUATE. THEN THEN IT'S THE IT'S THE SAME STATUS IT'S THE SAME STATUS. WE SHOULD NOT BE WE AS A LEGISLATURE WE AS A STATE THIS ADMINISTRATION SHOULD NOT BE IN THE POSITION OF PROTECTING. THOSE WHO RUN STATE MILITARY DUTY SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY'RE WEARING UNIFORMS. AND I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING SIR I REALLY DO BUT I'M JUST MY ISSUE IS IS THAT WE HAVE A CHAIN OF COMMAND TO ME OF UNITED STATES MILITARY RIGHT THAT IT IT HERE'S TO A CHAIN OF COMMAND. IT'S INVESTIGATED COMPLAINTS ARE BY INSPECTOR GENERAL THAT HAS AN APPEAL PROCESS TO THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE ON THE FEDERAL SIDE EVEN IF ITS TITLE TEN ISSUES. SO THERE IS A AN APPEAL PROCESS IN SO I GUESS. I THINK THERE'S ADEQUATE PROTECTIONS IN PLACE TO GO ALL THE WAY TO THE FEDERAL LEVEL IF NEED BE IF SOMEONE HAD A COMPLAINT. AND SO I DO I I HAVE A HUGE ISSUE WITH THAT BECAUSE I BELIEVE THEY'RE SEPARATE I DO BELIEVE THEY'RE SEPARATE AND I UNDERSTAND SAME THE SAME. CONCESSIONS AS A PRIVATE CITIZEN BUT TO CREATE A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION IN A MILITARY SCENARIO WHERE THERE IS A COMMANDCENTER. AND YOU TAKE THINGS OUT OF THE CHAIN OF COMMAND CASTING CONTROL YOU ALSO. REMOVE THE APPEAL PROCESS EVEN INSPECTOR GENERAL WHO DOES THEIR DUE DILIGENCE AND IS A COMPLETE INVESTIGATION. FINDS NO FINDINGS OR AND YOU KNOW WE'RE ENTITIES TO INSTANTIATE A COMPLAINT. AND THEN IF THEY WANTED TO APPEAL TO THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE THEY FIND IT NO FINDINGS ON A SUBSTANTIATED COMPLAINT AND THEN YOU STILL HAVE A RETALIATORY MECHANISM. MOST PEOPLE IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR JUST SETTLE TO GET RID OF IT SO LET'S GO THERE. IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR THERE'S A PART OF THE PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACT IN THOSE ATTORNEYS A FILE THOSE LAWSUITS GET ABOUT OF THE CASE SETTLEMENT WHAT'S THE PERCENTAGE THAT YOU WOULD GET AS AN ATTORNEY FROM THE DOT UNLESS YOU MISTER BLISS HARM HARMLESS YES. GO AHEAD AND SAY THAT OVER TIME AND THAT IN CASH WHAT'S YOUR THE PROCESS I'M SURE YOU TAKE IT ON A CONTINGENCY. I DON'T KNOW I'VE NEVER TAKEN IN THOSE CASES NEVER TAKEN THIS. ONE OF YOUR CLIENTS NO SHE'S NOT HE IS NOT. AT UC GENERAL BALD AND HOW MANY TIMES. I THINK THREE OR THREE THREE HAVE YOU BEEN SUCCESSFUL AND I HAVE NOT. SO THAT'S ANOTHER THING THAT BOTHERS ME IS THAT THE LAWS IN PLACE AND THERE ARE LAWS IN PLACE WHERE INSPECTOR CHEN HAS IN LET ME GO THERE HAS INSPECTOR GENERAL. ON THE CASES THAT YOU'VE SO GENERAL BALDING AND HAVE THE INSPECTOR GENERAL PROVIDED AND SUBSTANTIATED COMPLAINTS OR AN INVESTIGATION. ENTER ONE ONE THING FIRST. SOME OF THE RECENT REPORTS FROM THE INSPECTOR GENERAL TO CONGRESS. SHOW THAT 90% OF THE REPRISAL COMPLAINTS THEY RECEIVE. SOMEWHERE IN THAT AREA BETWEEN OUR CLOTHES WITHOUT AN INVESTIGATION. THEY JUST CLOSE THEM. THEY'RE NOT INVESTIGATED. SEVENTIES INVESTIGATED HIM. I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT WILL -- REPORTING THAT THEIR CLOTHES WITHOUT INVESTIGATION. DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS IN TERMS OF WHAT THEY'VE ACTUALLY DONE TO CLOSE IT. DIDN'T SEND ANYBODY AROUND ASK QUESTIONS. AND THE REASON THAT WE'RE HERE IS THE WHOLE SYSTEM IS BROKEN DOWN IN THAT RESPECT. YOU HAVE THE ABILITY IF THE INVESTIGATE IF THE ID DOESN'T DO THE INVESTIGATION DISCRETION. IT'S DISCRETIONARY IT IS. TO GO TO THE DOT IF THEY TAKE IT UP IS DISCRETIONARY THEY DON'T HAVE TO TAKE IT UP. AND WHEN THE MAJOR IS HERE SHE'S MADE A COMMENT THAT NINETY NINE POINT 99% OF I. G. COMPLAINTS. THE G. SAID NINETY NINE POINT DON'T FALL IN FAVOR OF THE PLAINTIFF I THINK THE REPRISAL COMPLACENT STAINED BY THE DOD ARE AROUND 1% SOMEWHERE IN THAT AREA. DO YOU HAVE DOCUMENTATION I CAN PROVIDE THAT YOUR OFFICE I WOULD BE HAPPY TO GIVE YOU WHAT I HAVE I DON'T HAVE IT WITH ME. OKAY SO I LIKE I SAID I HAVE A HUGE ISSUE -- I REALLY DO HAVE A HUGE ISSUE WITH THE STATE INTERFERING WITH THE MILITARY COMMAND THAT HAS AN APPEAL PROCESS TO THE DOD I AND I'M A FEMALE VETERAN ON THE FIRST FEMALE VETERAN THAT'S EVER SERVED IN THIS BUILDING. SO I GET IT AND AND YOU KNOW I'M NOT THE CHAIR OF THIS COMMITTEE BUT I'M THE BY STEERING AND I WOULD REALLY GAS THAT YOU'RE NOT TO ACCEPT THESE AMENDMENTS. AND I WOULD SUPPORT THE TERROR NOT ACCEPTING LIMITED BECAUSE TO DO THAT SIR. ANY OTHER COMMENT NO SIR. I'D LIKE [inaudible] TO WELL. FIRST ALTHOUGH THE HAVE. CENTER THE BOOT CASE THAT YOU REFERENCED. MY UNDERSTANDING IS THE PROBLEM -- IN IN TOTAL IF NOT AT LEAST IN LARGE PART WASTHAT THE INITIAL INVESTIGATION WAS A COMMANDER DIRECTED INVESTIGATION. UNDER THE INHERENT AUTHORITY OF THE COMMANDER THAT WAS -- PERHAPS MISHANDLED AND THAT WAS THE MATTER WAS ELEVATED TO THE STATE IG IN THE FEDERAL IG IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THINGS STARTED TO HAPPEN INCLUDING THE RELIEF OF OFFICERS AND INVESTIGATIONS IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING ARE STILL ON GOING. I WOULDN'T WANT ANYBODY IN THE AUDIENCE HERE. THAT THERE WAS ANYTHING OTHER THAN THAT. BUT I THINK THERE'S A PATH FORWARD HERE FOR YOU I THINK THE PATH FORWARD IS. TO KEEP THIS BILL LIVE IS TO ACCEPT THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS WHICH DO NOT INCLUDE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION. AND THEN WORK FOR WORK WITH THE FOLKS IN ON THE COMMITTEE HERE AS A MOVES OUT OF THE COMMITTEE TO SEE IF THERE IS A A PATH TO CRAFT LANGUAGE AS YOU WERE. WHEN THIS YEAR INDICATED TO DEAL -- SPECIFICALLY WITH PEOPLE WHO NEVER SERVED IN A TITLE TENER IDLE RUDY TO STATUS. WHO WERE STRICTLY ON? THE EQUIVALENT OF STATE EMPLOYEES I'M NOT SURE THAT WE CAN GET HER I'M NOT SURE I CAN. BUT I'M CERTAINLY. WILLING TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION BUT THE ALTERNATIVE IS. TO TO DO GO DOWN THE PATH YOU'RE GOING SO THAT'S UP TO YOU THAT THOSE ARE THE ONLY COMMENTS NORTHERN HOMAGE [inaudible] MERS. SO THE SENATE RATHER I I ACCEPT YOUR SUGGESTION I THINK THAT'S A WISE IDEA AND IF THAT'S ACCEPTABLE TO CHEER WHAT I I'VE I WOULD. ACCEPT THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS WE WON'T INCLUDE THE PARTICULAR ONE THAT'S AT ISSUE RIGHT NOW -- I DON'T WANT TO BE. A DISINGENUOUS SO IT'S AN AREA WHERE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK IN AND WILL BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE -- IF THERE'S ANY SIGNIFICANT SUBS OF CHANGE FROM THE POINT IN TIME WHEN IT LEAVES THE COMMITTEE. BUT LET ME RESPOND TO SENATOR GROW. THIS IS SORT OF AN APPLES AND ORANGE THING -- FIRST AS THE GERMAN BOB. I KNOW ONLY THE GENERAL BALDWIN IS AN EFFECTIVE HONORABLE OFFICER THIS IS NOT ABOUT GENERAL BONUS ON ABOUT APRIL. SIR IN THE NATIONAL GUARD -- SO-I WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT'S THAT'S CLEAR. ENOUGH [inaudible] WELL THE SENATOR -- BECAUSE SOMEONE APPEARS AS A WITNESS DOES NOT MEAN NECESSARILY THAT THAT THE AUTHOR OF THE BILL ADOPTS WHATEVER VIEWS WHATEVER WHATEVER BEHAVIORS AND AND I ASSUME YOU KNOW THAT SO. SO WHAT WILL PUT THAT ASIDE. BUT THE ISSUE WITH RESPECT -- TO WHETHER OR NOT THE MILITARY TAKES ACTION CERTAINLY THE MILITARY CAN AND SHOULD TAKE ACTION ANDERSON ISSUE CONCERNING. ANY SORT OF IMPROPRIETY. BUT BUT THAT DOESN'T. THAT DOESN'T DEAL WITH THE ISSUE OF SOMEONE WHO HAS BEEN HARMED HARM. SO FIRST I GET THIS DOES NOT INCLUDE MEDICAL MALPRACTICE. AND THAT'S A WHOLE DIFFERENT ISSUE. BUT WHAT THE FIRST DOCTOR IN. IS IS PREMISED UPON THE MILITARY BASICALLY IS IS SOVEREIGN. SO WHEN SOMEONE IN THE DANIELS CASE WHEN SOMEONE. DIES IN CHILDBIRTH THROUGH GROSS MALPRACTICE. AND SOMEONE IS HARMED THE CHILD FOR EXAMPLES LEFT WITH A LIFELONG INJURY. AND YOU CAN'T RECOVER THAT IS ON JUST IN CALIFORNIA. IF A WOMAN AND I'LL AND I'LL POINT TO A WOMAN IF A WOMAN HAS BEEN HARM BECAUSE OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT. BESIDES THE WHATEVER ADMINISTRATIVE OR CRIMINAL ACTION MAY BE TAKEN AGAINST THE PERPETRATOR. MY VIEW IS THAT WOMAN SHOULD HAVE A RIGHT TO RECOVER FOR WHATEVER INJURY SHE SUSTAINED IRRESPECTIVE OF WHETHER THE PERSON WHO PERPETRATED THAT. WRONGDOING IS IN UNIFORM OR NOT I TAKE YOUR POINT CONCERNING WHETHER THERE'S AN UNSUBSTANTIATED OR SUBSTANTIATE AND WE CAN CERTAINLY WORK ON THAT BUT IT'S REALLY. THE SORT OF APPLES AND ORANGES YEAH YES. YOU DON'T HAVE THAT MEDICAL MALPRACTICE IN YOUR BILL CORRECT OR NOT THE END I'M I'M USING THAT FOR THE LESSER CAM ILLUSTRATIVE PURPOSES IS TO ARMS THAT. WHEN THE FERRIES DOCTRINE IS IN PLACE? THAT BASICALLY PROVIDES A CLOAK OF IMMUNITY FOR MANY DIFFERENT HARMS AND BECAUSE THE CALIFORNIA AND I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THOSE WHO ARE ON STATE ACTIVE DUTY ACTUALLY PERFORM MEDICAL. PROCEDURES AT LEAST NOT. WE'RE GETTING OUR STATE IF THAT RIGHT. A CENTER RIGHT JUST ONE FINAL COMMENT AS YOU MOVE IF IN FACT YOU MOVE IN THE WAY YOU'VE INDICATED YOU'RE GONNA MOVE HERE WITH THE BILL AND YOU HAVE FURTHER CONVERSATIONS. WITH YOUR WITNESSES. I DON'T HAVE THIS GOVERNMENT CODE THAT DEFINES IMPROPER GOVERNMENTAL ACTIVITY IN FRONT OF ME SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT SAYS. BUT YOU WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT TOWARDS INNOCENCE -- JUST THINK ABOUT OPENING THE BARN DOORS ON NINE SELECTION FOR PROMOTIONS. IN A NATIONAL GUARD IT HAS TWENTY THOUSAND PEOPLE AND I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE THE STATE MALICIOUS. SO IF YOU HAVE A FEW OF A LIST OF YOU CLAIM WHISTLEBLOWER REPRISAL. AND AS A RESULT YOU CLAIM YOU WERE PROMOTED THEN I GUESS IN IN IN AFFECTING THIS WE WOULD AUTHORIZE. IN THE FACE OF A UNSUBSTANTIATED IG COMPLAINT WE'D AUTHORIZE A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION FOR NON SELECTION FOR PROMOTION. I WITH THE UNLESS THIS IS SOMEHOW LIMITED SO I DON'T WANT TO BELABOR THIS I'M JUST ASKING YOU AS YOU MOVE FORWARD. TO CONSIDER THAT. LITTLE PIECE NINE SELECTION ANYBODY FROM A SERGEANT. TO A I GUESS OF ONE STAR GENERAL AS WE ONLY HAVE A TWO FILES A CLAIM FOR NINE SELECTION FOR PROMOTION SO THERE YOU GO. I DON'T KNOW HOW THAT WORKS. I THINK THAT'S A POINT WELL TAKEN. MANY I'M GONNA GIVE YOU THE OPPORTUNITY CLOSE AFTER -- MY COMMENTS -- BUT WE'VE HEARD. ALLOWED TO SENATOR TO BE ABLE. TO RESPOND IN AND WITNESSES AND SHAUN AND WE'VE GIVEN PLENTY OF TIME. I CANNOT SEE THIS GOING FORWARD AS I SEE IT. WHEN A SOLDIER HAS THE RIGHT TO SUE ANOTHER SOLDIER AND I'LL ASK ANY VETERAN OUT THERE YOU TELL ME WHEN YOU SHOW? OR HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO SUE YOUR SERGEANT OR VICE VERSA IT'S NEVER HAPPENED THE MILITARY CODE OF JUSTICE HAD BEEN THERE. SINCE DAY ONE AND ALL OF US IN THE BY BY IT WE'VE ALL MAINTAIN OUR LINE OF OF SEQUENCE WHETHER IT'S THAT. THE PRIVATE WORKING HIS WAY UP TO TALK TO HIS COMMANDING OFFICER OR A CAT IN COMMAND OR WHATEVER BUT THERE WAS. THERE WAS OF A POLICY IN PLACE THE THE INSPECTOR GENERAL HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO LISTEN TAKE ACTION. AND EVERY SOLDIER. SAILOR WHOEVER THEY HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO KNOCK ON THAT DOOR AND TALK TO THE EXPECTING. TO THE INSPECTOR GENERAL SO WHEN THIS OPENS THE DOOR WHERE THE MILITARY CAN START SUING ONE ANOTHER. I I I THINK WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE GONNA OPEN UP THIS DOOR AND WE'RE NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO CLOSE. AND THAT'S MY FEAR FACTOR AND THE INSPECTOR GENERAL IS THERE -- THAT PROCESS HAS BEEN THERE -- OUR PROCEDURES IN THE MILITARY BEEN THERE EVER SENT TO ALL OF US WERE BORN AND IT BEFORE. SO I I'M AFRAID WITH THIS IS GOING TO DO AND A LOT OF GREAT MEN AND WOMEN HAVE SERVED IN DRAGON AND THEY'VE REPRESENTED OUR OUR SOLDIERS. WITH HONOR AND DIGNITY AND WHENTHERE IS A AN ISSUE ABOUT REPRISAL AND SO ON I THINK THE SYSTEM OVER THE YEARS THAT WE'VE ALL SURE. IT'S PROVEN RIGHT. AND SO THERE MIGHT BE ISSUES INDIVIDUALS WHO HAD ISSUES WITH THEIR COMMANDING OFFICERS BUT THAT DOES NOT -- I BELIEVE GIVES THE RIGHT TO THE CLEAN THE THE ENTIRE SLATE. THE MILITARY CODE OF JUSTICE IS THERE FOR A REASON AND SO I'M I'M GONNA HAVE TO SAY THAT -- WE CAN'T CHANGE THAT AND I DON'T WANT TO BEGIN TO CHANGE IT SO WITH THAT I'M GONNA ALLOW YOU TO CLOSE AND THEN I'M GOING TO GO AHEAD AND AND AND CALL FOR THE VOTE. SO I WANT TO BE CLEAR RIGHT YES YET WHAT WHAT WHAT I BELIEVE YOU'RE VOTING ON IS I BELIEVE YOU'RE VOTING ON THE BILL WITH PROPOSED AMENDMENTS EXCEPT. EXCEPT THE THE PROVISION THAT YOU JUST REFERENCE MISTER CHAIR EXCEPT -- TO BE VERY CLEAR SECTION THREE FIFTY SIX ONE B. SUBI AS IN BRAVO THAT WOULD NOT BE INCLUDED IN THE BILL. ALL THE OTHER AMENDMENTS THAT WE HAD WORKED OUT WITH THE WITH THE WITH THE STAFF WELL THE ONE I WOULD. STILL THE CODE OF ACTION.

THEY'VE OUTLINED A COUPLE AMENDMENTS THAT THERE WOULD COMMITTEES WILLING TO ACCEPT. AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GONNA VOTER RIGHT RIGHT. WE'RE GOING TO VOTE IN A GO. EIGHT OUT WHEN WE VOTE ON THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENT. NO BE IS OUT I'LL BE IS OUT. BROUGH IS OUT OKAY CLOSER SO THOSE ARE HIS THOSE ARE WE WORKING ON HIS DOCUMENTS. IS THE PROBLEM OF WORKING IN MEMBERS FROM THE DIE SO YES. THE WELL LET ME MAKE A SUGGESTION JUST AS A MEMBER. I'M NOT WORKING ON ANYBODY'S DOCUMENT OTHER THAN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS BECAUSE I HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE TO READ IT SO AND THIS I'M LOOKING AT THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS OF YOU ALL SITTING THERE. NOW. WE WON AND YOU HAVE A PROFIT SO LET ME. IN ORDER IS IF YOU KNOW WHAT WE SHOULD DO HERE'S HERE'S MY SUGGESTION JUST TO BE ABSOLUTELY CLEAR I THINK WE SHOULD COMPARE DOCUMENTS IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT COMMITTEE ANALYSIS TO ME AS THE CHIEF CONSULTANT.

NUSSBAUM LONG DAYS KEEP IT BRIEF -- AS A CENTER OUTLINED WE ALL KNOW THAT THERE'S A CALIFORNIA FACE CHALLENGES FINDING AFFORDABLE HOUSING ARE STRUGGLING WITH HOMELESSNESS IN THE EXTREME CASES. THIS ON PRESS UNPRECEDENTED HOUSING AND HOME WAS CRISIS IS LARGELY CAUSED BY. THE SERVER LACK OF NEW HOUSING CONSTRUCTION ALL LEVELS AFFORDABILITY. THAT SAID. A CRISIS LIKE THIS -- MERIT SPECIAL CONSIDERATION OF ADDITIONAL SUPPORT FOR VETERANS -- SB THREE SB SEVEN TWO FIVE DOES JUST THAT FOR BUTTONS BY REQUIRING CALVET TO PROVIDE THIS ADDITIONAL FUNDING ASSISTANCE TO HELP THEM FIND. A RENTAL HOUSING IN THE STATE. YESTERDAY I BOUGHT THANKS. WERE YOU GUYS PICK UP. OKAY -- LET'S SEE ANYONE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL COMPORT MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS PAT RAN OUT THERE AND READ A SOCIO TRIP WITHIN THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA RENTAL HOUSING ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. ON A WHEELCHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS JEFF BURGER ON WITH CALIFORNIA'S SENIOR LEGISLATURE WHICH IS GREATLY IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL ONE CABINET I WANT TO ADD. ALL VETERANS DESERVE HOUSING THE MATTER WHAT THEIR AGE BUT A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE VETERANS ARE OLDER ADULTS THANK YOU. MANY MONTHS NOW AS A FRUITFUL FUTURES PROJECT -- WE DO AN AWFUL LOT WITH WITH THE HOMELESS DOWN ON THE RIVER BAD. AND MARK AND FAMILY HOUSING POTTER SLAIN WERE THEY CONVERT. CONTAINERS FOR THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY SQUARE FEET OF HOUSING WE SUPPORT THIS BILL. AFTERNOON CHAIR MEMBERS SET THREE WITH THREE GOVERNMENT RELATIONS HOWEVER WE DO NOT HAVE AN OFFICIAL POSITION ON THIS BILL WE WILL BE REACHING OUT TO THE OFF THEIR TO GAIN SUPPORT FOR THE BILL. THANKS. ANYONE IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL NONE. THEN -- I'D LIKE TO GO AHEAD AND AS FOR YOUR COMMENTS SENATOR NOTHING AMISS CHURCHES TO QUESTION I DID JUST ON THE DISABLED OR VETERAN DEFINITION I WAS JUST CURIOUS AS TO HOW YOU DETERMINED -- OF AN OVERALL COMBINED RATING FACTOR OF 50% AS THRESHOLD. OF QUALIFYING -- A QUALIFIER IS THAT SOMETHING THAT'S TRADITIONALLY USED BY. CALVET OR A US TVA. AS AS OPPOSED 240% OR 45% OR 30% IF THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE'RE STILL DISCUSSING WITH CAL THAT'S AND AS WELL AS THE DOLLAR AMOUNT FOR THIS PROGRAM AND AS SOON AS WE HALF THAT -- WE WILL. BOB PUT INTO AMENDED INTO THE BILL. IDEA I ENCOURAGE YOU. TO TO THINK CAREFULLY ABOUT THAT I DON'T HAVE A FEELING ONE WAY OR THE OTHER I MEAN. I HAVE GREAT RESPECT FOR WERE -- FOR ALL OF THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO SERVE IN [inaudible] IN. VETERANS WHO ARE DISABLED -- BUT MY UNDERSTANDING IS DISABILITY RATINGS CAN VERY AND YOU CAN HAVE A 10% RATING OR YOU CAN HAVE A TWENTY OR 25% OR THIRTY OR FORTY OR FIFTY AND SO -- I'D WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE SOME OBJECTIVE EVIDENCE WHEN WE SET IT AT 50% AS OPPOSED. 240% AS OPPOSED 230%. BECAUSE WE WE HAVE. YOU KNOW WINNERS AND LOSERS. AND WE OUGHT TO HAVE A JUSTIFICATION FOR DOING THAT ONE WHAT WHAT SOME JUSTIFICATION THE CAN BE ARTICULATED. CLEARLY AMONG OUR OF VETERAN AND DISABLED VETERAN COMMUNITY SO I JUST ASK YOU TO HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS CAREFULLY WITH CALVET AND IF THEY'RE LISTENING I WOULD ASK THEM. TO THINK ABOUT IT -- CLOSELY THANK YOU MISTER. AND MISS ROB AND WILL DEFINITELY HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS I I'D LIKE TO ADD A MORE THANK YOU FOR COMING FORWARD THERE'S THERE'S SOME FLAWS THAT NEED TO BE CLEARED UP. ONE THE CALVET PROGRAM DOESN'T GIVE RATINGS THE V. EIGHT IS THE ONE WHO GIVES THE RATINGS AND THEY GO FROM 10% ALL THE WAY TO A 100%. SO IF YOU MENTION 50%. THEN THERE IT IS THERE'S YOUR WHICH COULD BE THE THRESHOLD -- WHITE FIFTY VERSUS FORTY WERE. EIGHTY YOU DON'T LOOK AT AT THAT -- SO YOU NEED TO DO A LITTLE MORE INVESTIGATION SHE WERE YOUR NUMBERS GOING TO BE THE AND THE OTHER THING IS WE HAVE SECTION EIGHT PROGRAM. IN THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES AS YOU KNOW SECTION. EIGHT THIS WOULD UP PERHAPS MERE SECTION EIGHT IT MIGHT LOOK INTO THAT BECAUSE IT IT IT'S THE SUBSIDY THAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR I WOULD THINK. TO HELP VETERANS -- THAT NEED HELP. WITH SUBSIDIZED RENT SO -- UNDER THE SECTION EIGHT PROGRAM THERE'S A THE THE INDIVIDUAL HYPOTHETICALLY MIGHT PAY A TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS AND THE SUBSIDY WOULD BE A THOUSAND DOLLARS TO PAY TWELVE HUNDRED DOLLAR MONTH RANT. ABOUT APARTMENT -- SO IF IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT THE SECTION EIGHT IS YOU MIGHT MERE THAT BECAUSE OTHERWISE YOU WON'T BE ABLE. TO JUSTIFY RECEIVING THE MONEY FROM THE CAL BAT. YOU YOU NEED TO HAVE SOME PARAMETERS SO CLOSER TO I WOULD RECOMMEND -- BUT I WILL -- GO FORWARD WITH THE BILL AND AND CERTAINLY BACK IT. BUT YOU NEED TO MAKE SOME AMENDMENTS THERE TO THAT TOTAL WHEN HE GETS INTO FINANCIAL YOU'LL BE ABLE. TO HAVE SOMETHING THERE THAT IT MERE SECTION EIGHT AND THAT IF IT IS 50% THERE YOU GO BECAUSE SOMEONE IT HAS A RATING OVER 50% STILL ABLE TO WORK. THEY MAY HAVE SOME SOME DISABILITIES AND SO ON IT ALSO LOOK INTO THAT -- GENERADO OTHER COMMENTS THAT. OKAY WE HAVE A MOTION TO MOVE IN -- TAKE THE ROLE. AND I JUST MAKES WE HAVE IN COMMON IS CLOSED YET WELL FIRST OF ALL THANK YOU SENATOR. HIM AS TRIED TO LET OF COURSE SENATE ARE TO LET UP I WILL DEFINITELY CONTINUE WORK ON THE BILL MAKE SURE THAT SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT YOU'VE EXPRESSED RIGHT NOW I HAVE BEEN. TAKING CARE OF BUT THANK YOU SO MUCH AND I AM A PROUD MEMBER OF A MILITARY FAMILY AND SO. GLAD YOU TO CARRY THIS BILL SO JUST ON BEHALF OF OUR VETERANS I ASKS RESPECTFULLY FOR YOUR ARRIVAL THANK YOU. GOOD HOW FOR THE BOOK. SB SEVEN TWENTY FIVE TO PASS BUT FIRST RE REFER RE REFER TO PREPARATIONS ARCHULETA HI ACTUALLY I GROWTH [inaudible] THE TITLE [inaudible] NIELSEN. ROTH. ROTH AYE NUMBER. WILK. ALL THAT OPEN OKAY WE'LL HOLD IT OPEN BE REGULATIONS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR SUPPORTING OUR VETERANS [inaudible] OKAY -- NEXT UP IS SENATOR GLAZIER. CENTER GLAZER YOU HAVE SENATE BILL -- SIX FOUR FOUR GO HEAD PRESENT YOUR BILL. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN NICE TO BE HERE IN FRONT OF YOUR COMMITTEE. THIS THIS LEGISLATION THAT'S BEFORE YOU WOULD PROVIDE RENTAL RELIEF. BASED IN CALIFORNIA. I REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF SECURITY DEPOSIT SERVICE MEMBERS ARE REQUIRED TO PAY TO MOVE INTO A RENTAL UNIT. PROHIBITS LANDLORDS FROM DISCRIMINATING AGAINST SERVICE MEMBERS. ARRIVING TO PAY LESS SECURITY DEPOSIT. BUT THERE IS A LEGISLATION ALSO BY SENATOR HILL SP. TWO TO TWO THAT ENFORCES THIS PER PRO THIS PROVISION. PRIVATE BY PROHIBITING DISCRIMINATION IN THE RENTAL MARKET BASED ON VETERAN OR MILITARY SERVICE SO. IS A REMEDY TO THE CONCERN THAT WAS RAISED IN THE ANALYSIS -- IN REGARD TO THAT THAT ISSUE -- WE DO HAVE A HOUSING CRISIS IN OUR STATE IT MAKES A PARTICULARLY DIFFICULT FOR SERVICE MEMBERS TO AFFORD UP FRONT COST. OF MOVING INTO A RENTAL UNIT IN IN CALIFORNIA. I WITH MILITARY BARRACKS BECOMING SCARCER THE NEED FOR SERVICE MEMBERS TO FIND HOUSING IN THE COMMUNITY WHERE THEIR STATION BECOMES MORE. COMMON. AND MORE NECESSARY. NOW THOSE SERVICE MEMBERS RECEIVE A BASIC ALLOWANCE FOR HOUSING. MANY SAY IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO COVER THE UP FRONT COSTS THESE OF THE UP FRONT COST OF RENTING CALIFORNIA. AND ALTHOUGH SERVICE MEMBERS IN CALIFORNIA RECEIVE A LARGER ALLOWANCE TO OR THE HIGHER COST OF LIVING. WHEN SERVICE MEMBERS FROM OTHER STATES MOVED T CALIFORNIA? WE HAVE A LOT OF EXAMPLES OF THAT. IT OFTEN TAKES MONTHS FOR THE INCREASE IN THE ALLOWANCE TO KICK IN. SERVICE MEMBERS RESORT TO LOANS IN FACT THAT THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE -- LAST WEEK WE HAD SOME SERVICE MEMBERS COME IN AND TALK ABOUT THAT THEY RESORT TO LOANS. OTHER FORM OF CREDIT TO PAY THEIR SECURITY DEPOSIT FIRST MONTH'S RENT AND THIS LEGISLATION ADDRESSES THAT PARTICULAR ISSUE. FURTHER MORE SERVICE MEMBERS HAVE A HIGHER STANDARD OF CONDUCT IT THEY MUST COMPLY WITH IN THEIR PERSONAL LIVES THAN CIVILIANS. I KNOW MANY OF YOU KNOW THAT IF THEY DO NOT MEET THE STANDARD THEY MAY BE REPRIMANDD BY THEIR COMMANDING OFFICER OR THE MILITARY.

TOGETHER BOTH OF THESE -- BILLS PROTECT VETERANS WERE RELOCATED TO CALIFORNIA AND ALSO DEALING WITH THE VERY HIGH COST OF HOUSING IN THE STATE THANK YOU FOR GOOD THANK YOU. IN GOTHAM CALIFORNIA STATE COUNCIL. THIS BILL AND FRANKLY ALL THE VETERANS IN CALIFORNIA DON'T HELP WE CAN GET THANK YOU THANK YOU. AMVETS DURING PLASTER VICE COMMANDER WE SUPPORT. YOU GOT IT THANK YOU. ANYONE IN OPPOSITION -- WE HAVE SOMEONE AT THE BOAT OKAY. YEAH IT DOT JUST. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE JENNIFER STACK ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS. THERE HASN'T OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION ON SB. SIX FORTY FOUR THE NOT MEASURE SEVERELY LIMITS THE ABILITY OF SMALL PROPERTY OWNERS TO RECOUP LOSSES RESULTING FROM DAMAGE DONE TO A PROPERTY BY A TENANT. CURRENTLY TWENTY FOUR STATES INCLUDING NEW YORK ALLOW RENTAL PROPERTY OWNERS TO ASK FOR A SECURITY DEPOSIT FOR A RESIDENTIAL RENTAL PROPERTY IN. ANY AMOUNT THEY CHOOSE IN SHARP CONTRAST CALIFORNIA HAS A STATUTORY LIMIT PLACED -- IN PLACE THAT RESTRICTS THE SECURITY DEPOSIT AMOUNT THAT MAY BE COLLECTED ON A PROPERTY OWNER. SB SIX FORTY FOUR ALTERS THAT RESTRICTION BY TO DRAMATICALLY REDUCING THE SECURITY DEPOSIT. AMOUNT THAT MAY BE COLLECTED FROM A MILITARY PERSONNEL AS WELL AS FROM THEIR SPOUSE PARENTS DOMESTIC PARTNERS INDEPENDENCE. UNFORTUNATELY THE DRASTIC REDUCTION WILL HURT SMALL LANDLORDS AS THEY LACKED THE FINANCIAL RESOURCES NECESSARY TO MAKE REPAIRS. OUT OF POCKET TO UNITS DAMAGED BY TENANTS THEY'RE ALSO LESS LIKELY TO CONTACT A UNIT COMMANDER TO MAKE A CIVIL COMPLAINT. WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST THAT SB SIX FORTY FOUR BE AMENDED TO EXEMPT SMALL LANDLORDS OWN PROPERTIES WITH FIFTEEN UNITS ARE LESS. AS THE BILL COMPRISES COMPROMISES THEIR ABILITY TO RECOUP LOSSES RESULTING FROM DAMAGE DONE TO THE PROPERTY BY A TENANT. FOR THESE REASONS THERE MUST OPPOSE SB SIX FORTY FOUR UNTIL IT IS AMENDED TO EXEMPT THESE SMALL MOM AND POP RENTAL PROPERTY OWNERS. WITH FIFTEEN UNITS ALAS RESPECTFULLY REQUEST. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS PAT RAN WITH THEIR AND READING ASSOCIATES REPRESENTING THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA RENTAL HOUSING ASSOCIATION. WE ARE OPPOSED TO THE BILL FOR THE SAME REASONS THAT -- CA ARE IS SUPPOSED -- 80% OF OUR MEMBERS -- OWN UNIT OF THE FIFTEEN UNITS ARE LESS -- SO THAT AMENDMENT WOULD GO A LONG WAY TO LEVY A OUR CONCERNS AND WITH REGARD TO IN THIS IS FOR ACTIVITY NOT VETERANS AND WITH REGARD TO BEING ABLE TO CONTACT. THE COMMANDING OFFICER IF -- THE ACTIVE DUTY MILITARY -- RENTER -- DOESN'T PAY RAN TERROR IS VIOLATING THE LEASE -- THIS LEGISLATURE PASSED I BELIEVE LAST YEAR A BILL. THAT PROHIBITS. LANDLORDS AND PROPERTY OWNERS FROM CONTACTING THE COMMANDING OFFICER OF THAT -- RENTER UNLESS THEY HAVE WRITTEN PERMISSION FROM -- BUT THAT RENTER TO DO SO SO -- FOR THOSE REASONS UNFORTUNATELY WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO OPPOSE THE BILL -- THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. MAYBE THE MAYBE THE AUTHOR COULD CLARIFY. SO THE THE PROVISION THAT PROHIBITS LANDLORDS FROM DEMANDING RECEIVING SECURITY FROM A MILITARY [inaudible] SERVICE MEMBER. FOR THEIR SPOUSE OR DOMESTIC PARTNER DEPENDENT ARE THOSE DOES IT. DOES IT SUGGEST THAT THOSE PEOPLE ARE LIVING IN THE SAME HOUSEHOLD IS THAT THE ISSUE. OR IF MY DEPENDENT HAS A SEPARATE RENTAL UNIT DOES THE PROVISIONS APPLY IN THAT CASE AS WELL. WELL I'M NOT SURE I UNDERSTAND YOUR QUESTION THAT THIS BILL WOULD ONLY APPLY TO THE SERVICE MEMBER AND IMMEDIATE MEMBERS OF THEIR FAMILY. IN THE SAME UNIT IN THE SAME BOAT RENTAL YOU CORRECT. SO IN THE MILITARY MEMBER. IS NOT THE IS NOT THE SIGNATORY ON THE LEASE BUT RATHER THE THE PARENT IS IN THE MILITARY MEMBERS LIVING WITH A PARENT IN THE SAME APARTMENT. THESE PROVISIONS WITH A PLAN THAT LAYS OUT THE YOU KNOW THE THE SERVICE MEMBER HAS TO DISCUSS. MILITARY STATUS UPON RENTAL OF THE UNIT OR ELSE NONE OF THE PROVISIONS REALLY WOULD COME INTO. PLAY BECAUSE THIS IS ABOUT A SECURITY DEPOSIT. SO IT'S ONLY ABOUT WHAT THEY PUT IN ONE MONTH SECURITY POSITIVE TWO MONTHS SECURE DEPOSIT DEPENDING ON THE UNIT -- THERE'S PROVISIONS BASED ON WHETHER ITS IT'S IT'S GOT STUFF AND IT SURE DOES -- SO THAT'S THE ONLY THING THAT THIS THIS MEASURE TEMPS TO DEAL WITH IS THAT SECURITY DEPOSIT BUT DOWN AT THE START -- AND IT ONLY WAY THIS BILL GOES INTO EFFECT. IS IF THIS. THAT IDENTIFIES THEMSELVES AS AT BEING AN ACTIVE MILITARY STATUS. WELL THERE IS A IS A QUESTION CENTERS BECAUSE OF THE COMMENTS OF THE OPPONENTS HERE I GATHER THEY MADE THE COMMENT BECAUSE OF THEY PERCEIVE THE BILL APPLYING TO A SITUATION WHERE A DEFENDANT OF A MILITARY MEMBER COMES IN ATTEMPTS TO RENT. AND THEY'RE NOT PERMITTED IN THAT CIRCUMSTANCE FROM. FROM RECEIVING THE SAME SECURITY DEPOSIT THAT THEY WOULD BE ALLOWED TO RECEIVE FROM ANY OTHER NON MILITARY. TENDED IN THE STATE SO IF YOU JUST TAKE A LOOK AT THAT I'M HAPPY TO I AM NOT THE BILL BY I INTERPRETED THAT THE COMMON SLIGHTLY DIFFERENTLY THAT IT WAS ABOUT. THE ABILITY -- TO IF THE ACTIVE DUTY SERVICE MEMBER -- IN -- HAD DAMAGES IN EXCESS OF THE TO POSIT THAT ONE MONTH'S DEPOSIT IN MOST CASES. THAT THE IT WAS ABOUT THE RECOURSE THAT THAT OUT LANDLORDS MIGHT HAVE WITH THEIR COMMANDING OFFICER. AND THAT THAT THEY REFERENCE A PROVISION THAT -- THAT WITHOUT WRITTEN CONSENT THEY COULD NOT CONTACT THE COMMANDING OFFICER THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT I HEARD THERE. IN THAT PARTICULAR CASE -- I'M OPEN TO THE SUGGESTION OF PROVIDING THAT THAT REQUIRING THAT WRITTEN AUTHORIZATION UPON RENTAL OF THE UNIT. A LOOK AT NO ONE WANTS TO HAVE -- LANDLORD BE THAT TIME DRY THAT'S NO ONE'S INTEREST HERE. IT'S A IT'S PARAGRAPH IT'S SECTION [inaudible] TO I AM DOING THIS RIGHT [inaudible] HE TWO IS THE IS IS WHERE THERE. IS WHERE THEY'RE ISSUE. LIES I THINK SO IF YOU JUST TAKE A LOOK AT THAT FIVE MOVE THE BILL SO I DON'T WANT TO BELABOR TIS. SENATE ROTH WITH YOUR PERMISSION I'M I WOULD LIKE TO AGREE WITH YOU THAT IS OE OF OUR CONCERNS% THAT. THE THE BILL ISN'T BIG US IT ALMOST REACHES IF IT'S SEPARATED AND SO THAT JUST BY PROXY OF BEING RELATED TO MILITARY PERSONNEL YOU COULD. APPLY TO HAVE THE REDUCTION WHETHER THEY LIVE WITH YOU OR NOT I GATHER THIS THAT THE CENTERS ATTENTION ITSELF CLEAR THAT. THERE WAS CHAIR. COMMON AS WELL WE WANT TO MAKE THIS IS AS A BUSINESS FRIENDLY. AS VETERAN FRIENDLY WEEKS POSSIBLY COULD. AND YOU HAD MENTIONED FIFTEEN UNITS AND BELOW IS MY POP. THING -- BUT THE BILL DOES SAY EXCESSIVE -- AMOUNT OF SECURITY DEPOSIT AND THAT'S THAT'S A QUESTION THAT THE MILITARY IS ALWAYS CONCERNED ABOUT. THAT SOMEONE. ANY LANDLORD REGARDLESS OF THE NUMBER OF UNITS -- ASK FOR A DODGE PURITY DEPOSIT THAT HIS EX IN EXCESS. OF THAT'S A QUESTION IS IT ONE MONTH DID YOU FIND EXCESSIVE. WHAT WOULD BE EXCESSIVE AND AT SUCH A GOOD QUESTION AND THE ORIGINS OF THIS BILL CAME FROM THE COMMANDER IF THAT CAN'T PARK IN MY DISTRICT. WHO HAS THAT -- OBVIOUSLY ACTIVE DUTY MILITARY. SERVING ON HER FACE AND NECK AND AS VERY WELL AWARE OF THE EXPERIENCES THEY WERE FACING IN TERMS OF THIS UPFRONT COSTS. THIS BILL REDUCES THAT OBLIGATION IN MOST CASES FROM TWO MONTHS OF THE SECURITY DEPOSIT. TO ONE SO THERE IS STILL SECURITY DEPOSIT PLACE. BUT IT'S THE SECOND MONTH IT'S CAUSING THE FINANCIAL CHALLENGES -- THAT THE BILL TRY SO AMENDMENT READ. THAT THAT THE DEMAND IN EXCESS OF ONE MONTH AS A DEPOSIT. THEN YOU HAVE. SOMETHING THAT'S REASONABLE BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT EXCEEDING. SOMEONE WERE ASKING FOR TWO OR THREE MUCH DEPOSIT AT LEAST THE LANDLORD KNOWS THAT HE HAS. THE ABILITY TO TO RECEIVE A DEPOSIT BUT NOT IN EXCESS F OF A MONTH. THAT MIGHT BE A POSSIBILITY. THE OTHER IS THE FACT THAT. THAT THE UNIT MUST BE OCCUPIED BY THE FAMILY. OF THE ACTIVE DUTY MEMBER. AND ALSO THAT HE GIVES PERMISSION. TO ALLOW HIS COMMANDING OFFICER TO BE NOTIFIED IN THE EVENT HE DOESN'T. PAY THE RENT. I THINK THAT WOULD. THAT WOULD TAKE CARE OF SOME OF THE ISSUE BECAUSE THE OPPOSITION SAYS. THAT IF I'M GOING TO DO THIS -- WHAT WE DO FOR MAY WELL IF YOU DO THIS YOU HAVE ACCESS TO MY COMMANDING OFFICER AND IF YOU? DON'T -- REQUIRED TWO OR THREE MONTHS. OF DEPOSIT THEN YOU CAN CALL MY COMMANDING OFFICER AND SHOW IN MY IN LINE THE SENATOR. WITH WITH AN AMENDMENT THAT YOU THINK YOU CAN PUT TOGETHER ON THAT YEAH SO I'M I AND I I I COULD CERTAINLY COMMITTED TO CLEARING UP THIS ISSUE THAT IT'S REALLY IS ABOUT THE HE OR SHE ACTIVE DUTY SERVICE MEMBER. WE'RE TRYING TO AND TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THOSE WHO MAY BE LIVING WITH THAT ACTIVE DUTY SERVICE NUMBER -- THE ACTIVE DUTY SERVICE MEMBER AND FAMILY THAT'S RIGHT THAT THAT IS THAT'S WHAT IT SAID IT TEMPTING TO ADDRESS IF THAT'S NOT CLEAR IN TE BILL HAPPY. TO YEAH THE TO CLEAR THAT UP -- THAT YES WE ARE SPECIFICALLY ADDRESSING THE ISSUE OF WHETHER OR NOT THE REQUIREMENT OF A SECOND MONTH OR THIRD MONTH IS REQUIRED WE'D LIKE IT TO BE -- ALL ONE MONTH -- IN REGARD TO AN UNFURNISHED UNIT IN TWO MONTHS IN REGARD -- TO FURNISHED UNIT. SO. THAT THAT I THINK IT'S CLEAR IN THE BILL AND I AND THAT GOT MY ATTENTION AND I DON'T AND I SEE THAT. MA'AM IT'S IT'S RIGHT HERE AND THEN ABOUT -- NOT TO BE GREATER pRENT. SO I THINK THAT GIVES YOU THE SECURITY DEPOSIT THAT THAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR AND ACCESS TO THE COMMANDING OFFICER IF YOU CAN MAKE THOSE AMENDMENTS. MR RESPECTFULLY ON OUR OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS LAW HAS LOOKED AT THE ISSUE VERY CAREFULLY -- THAT HAVING A SEPARATE STANDARD FOR FOR MILITARY PERSONNEL BUT PLACES ON OUR STANDARDS ON ON OUR SMALL MOM AND POPS. THEY DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE THE SAME KIND OF OPERATING COSTS THAT ARE LARGE PROPERTY OWNERS DO. ON WHICH IS WHY THEY'VE MADE THE CONCESSIONS THAT -- IF WE COULD REMOVE THE SMALL MOM AND POPS THE FIFTEEN UNITS UNLESS WHICH ARE NOT PROFESSIONALLY MANAGED -- THAT WOULD GO A LONG WAY -- TOWARDS US BEING ABLE TO REMOVE OPPOSITION IN FACT IF WE WERE TO EXEMPT THOSE PROPERTIES WE COULD MOVE OPPOSITION IN ITS ENTIRETY YEAH. THAT'S WHERE WE'RE STILL NOT IN AGREEMENT AND AS THE OTHER WITNESS IN OPPOSITION THE BILL TESTIFIED 80% OF THEIR UNITS. OUR LOW ARE FIFTEEN UNITS -- OUR LAST SO WE HEARD THAT IT IS A LARGE PART OF THE RENTAL MARKET YEAH AND THAT'S NOT REALLY TRYING TO GET IT HELPING THE SERVICE MEMBERS THAT TERMS OF WHAT THEY TYPICALLY INDOOR -- WHICH IS WHY WE HAVE WE STILL NOT REALLY THE SAME PAGE ON THAT. BUT IN THE LAST POINT THAT YOU MADE ABOUT. PERMISSION -- TO CONTACT THE COMMANDING OFFICER I'M OPEN TO TO TRY TO CRAFT AMENDMENTS TO MAKE SURE THAT. THAT WOULD BE GRANTED A GOOD CASE CENTER IN THE REASON WE HAVE TO MAKE THIS IS FRIENDLY AS POSSIBLE BECAUSE WE WANT TO MAKE THE HOUSING. AVAILABLE TO AS MANY MILITARY PERSONNEL AS POSSIBLE. AND IF THERE'S FIVE OR SIX UNIT SOMEWHERE OR TEN OR TWELVE AND THERE'S VACANCIES WE WANT THOSE VETERANS OR NOT THE BETTER BUT THE MILITARY PERSONNEL TO HAVE A AN EQUAL OPPORTUNITY AMONG THEMSELVES. TO GO FOR IT AND IF THEY HAVE PERMISSION TO TO SEE THEIR COMMANDING OFFICER THE LAND ORDER OR MANAGER ADDS THAT I THINK THAT WILL TAKE CARE OF THAT -- NOT TO EXCEED IT A MONTH'S RENT I THINK THAT TAKES CARE YOUR EXCESSIVE -- RENT THAT WOULD NORMALLY BE CHARGE AND IT'S THE FAMILY OF THE VETERANS IN THOSE THREE ITEMS AND IF YOU CAN MAKE HELL TO JUST ONCE. I THINK TWO OR THREE IS NOT BAD. THIS YEAR I THINK THAT WE CAN -- MAKE THAT ACCOMMODATION -- AS YOU HAVE INDICATED. LET ME JUST SAY THAT THE ALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS HAS INCREDIBLE PARTNERSHIP -- WITH OUR MILITARY WITH VETERANS AND ACTIVE DUTY SERVICE MEMBERS AND I I KNOW THAT. THEY COME HERE WITH THEIR CONCERNS THAT -- DEEPLY FELT BUT NOT OUT OF ANY ANY. LACK OF WONDERFUL SUPPORT -- THAT WE GET FROM OUR REALTORS LOCALLY AND CERTAINLY FROM THE STATE'S OF WILL CONTINUE TO WORK OUT THESE WILL TRY TO SEE IF WE CAN WORK OUT THESE DIFFERENCES WE DO HAVE A THE FUNDAMENTAL ONE THAT WE HAVEN'T GOTTEN TO YET. BUT ON THE ONES THAT YOU'VE RAISED I THINK WE CAN FIND A COMBINATION ON I BELIEVE TALK AND I APPRECIATE. EVERYONE WHO DOES OPEN THEIR DOORS VETERANS AS WELL TO THANK YOU FOR THAT. IF THERE ARE NO OTHER COMMENTS -- IN I THINK WE THEY WOULDN'T COVER THE BOTH THE WE ASK FOR THE AND YOUR CLOSING COMMENTS I THINK THAT THAT MADE THEM AND I THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION TODAY AND AND FOR YOUR CONCERN FOR OUR VETERANS AND ACTIVE DUTY SERVICE MEMBERS.
