TO SOME OF MY STAFF IS HERE IF THERE'S ANYTHING IN PARTICULAR -- I DON'T KNOW I'M HAPPY TO TURN TO THEM -- I WANTED TO SOLVING BUT I WILL SAY ASK MY CHIEF DEPUTY -- CAROTID STAND UP PLEASE HE JUST WAS IN A REAR END ACCIDENT NOT HIS FAULT AND I FIVE AND HE GOT HERE. SKIPPING THROUGH THE BACK ROOM LIKE A WHISTLING SAILOR PAYMENT. I KNOW NO ONE KNEW WHAT THAT MEANT BUT AS YOU CAN REMEMBER THE OLD SPICE ADS RIGHT ANYWAY SO -- AND DESPITE MY PROMISED TO BE BRIEF CAM HOT TO BE BRIEF I'M GONNA START AND SEVENTEEN NINETY VERY UNUSUAL REGULATORY -- ENVIRONMENT -- FOR A QUOTE CLOSELY REGULATED PRODUCT AND A LOT OF IT HAS TO DO WITH PROHIBITION SO PEOPLE JUST PLAIN DRANK A LOT AND IN THE EARLY PARTS THIS -- OUR OUR REPUBLIC. THEY YOU CAN SEE THE AMOUNTS ARE JUST PRETTY PHENOMENAL THE ACTUALLY DECREASED OVER THE COURSE OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY BUT WHAT BUT WHAT THERE WAS SO MUCH ABUSE OF ALCOHOL. THAT -- A TEMPERANCE MOVEMENT REALLY ROSE UP THAT LEAD TO PROHIBITION AND AND THE TWENTIES OR IN CENTER. AND IT WAS REALLY PART OF DAILY LIFE -- I'M A BIG CHARLES DICKENS FAN AND DAVID COPPERFIELD NINE YEARS OLD HOUSE ALE FOR LUNCH SO THAT'S HOW MUCH PEOPLE DRINK BACK THEN -- THERE ARE LOTS AND LOTS OF REVIEWED HIS PREDATORY MARKETING PRACTICES ALL CALL THEM -- THAT THINK THAT DREW THE IRE OF PROHIBITIONISTS -- AND ONE OF THOSE WHICH WE'RE GONNA TALK ABOUT MORE IN DETAIL LATER WAS THE TIGHT HOUSE -- AND JUST GENERALLY WHAT THE TIE IS A MANUFACTURER CONTROLS A RETAILER -- IT COULD BE THAT THE MANUFACTURER SUPPLIES EQUIPMENT SUPPLIES ALCOHOL SUPPLIES WHATEVER BUT IT'S ESSENTIALLY THE CONTROL. OF OF OF ONE TIER OF THE INDUSTRY MANUFACTURER RETAILER. AND A CANDY THINGS ARE MORE NUANCED WHICH WILL TALK ABOUT LATER. BUT REALLY PROHIBITION -- VERY MUCH OF A SOCIAL MOVEMENT -- AND THEN OF COURSE IN NINETEEN NINETEEN WE HAVE -- WE HAD ACTUAL PROHIBITION BY CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT I'M IS REALLY VERY MUCH OF A PARTLY A RELIGIOUS PARTLY HEALTH. I'M PARTLY A PUBLIC SAFETY EFFORTS -- AND AS WE KNOW FROM THE HISTORY OF AL CAPONE AND OTHERS AND THERE'S A GUN THERE WHICH IS KIND OF HARD TO SEE NEXT OF THOSE CARDS -- IT ALSO LED TO IT UNFORTUNATELY LED TO A WHOLE BUNCH OF CRIME THERE WERE ACTUALLY BENEFITS FROM IT -- CIRRHOSIS OF THE LIVER FOR EXAMPLE WENT WAY DOWN BUT PEOPLE OF COURSE STILL DRINK -- AND INSTEAD OF DRINKING IN A LEGAL WAY SELECTIVITY WHICH IN NINETEEN THIRTY THREE LED TO THE REPEAL OF PROHIBITION -- AND ONE OF THE UNUSUAL THINGS THAT HAPPEN IN THE REPEAL WAS THAT THE STATE'S WERE GIVEN THE RIGHT TO REGULATE ALCOHOL. UNLIKE ANY OTHER PRODUCT IN THE UNITED STATES SO TIME IS WALLS REMEMBER FROM CITIZENS CIVICS OF THOSE OF US WHO ARE HAVE LAW SCHOOL INFLICTED ON THEM -- GENERALLY COMMERCE AND OTHER THING SHOULD FLOOR ACROSS STATE LINES WITHOUT DISCRIMINATION WILL ONE DAY -- PRODUCT REALLY EXEMPTED FROM THAT IS ALCOHOL AND THAT'S BY THE TWENTY FIRST AMENDMENT SO STATES CAN HAVE NO ALCOHOL. BACON ABOUT CALL THAT IS REGULATED VERY STRICTLY THEY CAN DICTATE IS SOME STATES HAVE IN THE PAST THAT THERE BE NO BEER SOLD WITH MORE THAN THREE POINT SO IT'S AN IT'S AN UNUSUAL REGULATORY SCHEME. I WON THAT EXPLAINS A LOT OF THE COMPLEXITY OF THE LAWS IN CALIFORNIA. AND LOS ROUTE THE COUNTRY'S ORIGINALLY THE BE -- WE WAS THE REGULATOR -- AND THERE WAS A GIANT SCANDAL -- OF KICKBACKS AND PAYOFFS ON CASPAR WEINBERGER ACTUALLY WAS THE LEAD THE INVESTIGATIONS INTO THIS -- SOME OF SOME FISHEL'S FLED TO MEXICO ALAN CRANSTON FAMOUSLY -- INVITED ONE OF THEM TO GET IS PENSION CHECK WHICH USE GOING TO KEEP ON HIS DESK IN SACRAMENTO AND HE COULD COME BACK IN THE CALIFORNIA GET IS PENSION CHECK IF YOU WANTED IT. UPON WHICH HE WOULD BE ARRESTED AND SENT TO PRISON A WONDERFUL HISTORY AND IN NINETEEN FIFTY FIVE THE CONSTITUTION WAS PASSED THAT -- THAT CREATED MY AGENCY -- AS I USED TO LIKE TO TELL GOVERNOR BROWN -- I'M THE ONLY ON ELECTED CONSTITUTIONAL OFFICER IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND THAT'S BY THE NINETEEN FIFTY FIVE A MINUTE NOW THAT DOESN'T MEAN I CAN'T BE -- RELIEVED OF MY DUTIES AT ANY MOMENT BUT NEVERTHELESS AT LEAST I GET TO SIT ON THE CONSTITUTION VERY PROBABLY -- SO SOME OF THE SOME OF THE ISSUES WE FACE IN -- THE RIGIDITY OF OUR LAWS ALSO ARE BY THE FACT THAT THE CITY IN THE CONSTITUTION ALTHOUGH I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF FLEXIBILITY BIG MOST OF THE THINGS WE WANT TO DO IN THE STATE CAN BE ACCOMPLISHED DESPITE -- THE FACT THAT THERE ARE LIMITS PROPOSED BY OUR OWN CONSTITUTION. OKAY SO BACKED UP TO THE DEPARTMENT SO I MOVED FROM SEVENTEEN NINETY TWO TWO THOUSAND AND NINETEEN SEVEN MINUTES -- AND AGAIN ASK MANY QUESTIONS AS WE GO -- I REALLY DON'T MEAN TO GOES SO FAST I JUST WOULD LIKE TO ALLOW YOU TIME TO TALK TO ME ABOUT WHATEVER YOU WANT. SORE BUDGET SEVENTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS WE ARE 1100% SENT SPECIAL FUND AT ALL OF OUR MONEY COMES FROM FEES THAT THE INDUSTRY PAYS US -- WE HAVE FOUR ENGINE FIFTY NINE PEOPLE ABOUT WHERE ABOUT HALF SWORN. ON AND WE HAVE FIELD OFFICES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA -- ALL THE WAY WE HAVE YOUR RECON READING PALM DESERT -- SOME OF OUR LICENSING WORK IS DONE BY PROFESSIONALS AS YOU'D EXPECT. ARM IT'S BUT WE HAVE A FAIRLY COMPLICATED PROCESS BUT THERE'S EXPERTS WHO UNDERSTAND IT AND FOR THOSE PEOPLE WHO DON'T WE HAVE A LOT OF FIRST AND SECOND GENERATION SMALL BUSINESS PEOPLE. WE ARE VERY COMMITTED TO HOLDING THEIR HANDS AND WALKING THEM THROUGH THE PROCESS -- WE HAVE INTERPRETERS WE WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME WITH HANDS ON WORK FOR PEOPLE NEEDED. I'M REALLY TRYING TO HELP -- PEOPLE ET INTO BUSINESS AND NOT BE A HURDLE FOR THEM AS LONG AS THEY ARE -- THEIR GOALS ARE WHAT ARE ALL OF OUR GOAL SHOULD BE WHICH IS TO HELP CALIFORNIAN GROW JOBS. TO BIG BUSINESS -- YOU CAN SEE THE RESTAURANT BUSINESS FIFTY BILLION DOLLARS WINERIES FIFTY SEVEN BILLION. TWO MILLION DOLLARS TWO MILLION JOBS IN CALIFORNIA. AND THEY TEND TO BE PRETTY GOOD JOBS -- IT IS A IT IS AN INDUSTRY VIRTUALLY ALL OF IT -- AND IT'S JUST IT'S A FANTASTIC ECONOMIC GROWTH -- PART OF OUR STATE -- WE LICENSE ALL CURRENT YES CHAIRMAN. TO ASK FOR QUESTIONS HE'LL. I BOUGHT WAS A SEEING THOSE NUMBERS BEFORE BUT I NEVER SEE A NUMBER RELATED. TO HARD. ALCOHOL IN TERMS OF DOLLAR ECONOMIC VALUE WHAT THE HOW MUCH OF THAT IS SOLD IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE HAVE ANY. INFORMATION ON THAT I I DON'T KNOW THAT WE ACTUALLY DO -- WE MIGHT -- NOT NO NOTHING FROM THE PEANUT GALLERY -- THE WHAT WHAT I WOULD SAY IS AND WE AND WE CAN WE'RE GONNA TALK ABOUT THIS I THINK A LITTLE BIT BUT IN TERMS OF RESTAURANTS -- HARD ALCOHOL IS BECOMING INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT TO THEIR BUSINESS MODELS AND I'M IN IT'S AN ONGOING ISSUE THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH BECAUSE THERE ARE LIMITS ON THE NUMBER OF BUSINESSES THAT CAN SELL OUR OUR ALCOHOL. I'M IN PARTLY BY THE WAY. TAKE IT BACK PROHIBITION PARTLY THE REASON WAS IS THAT. IT WAS IT'S IT'S IT'S FAR MORE INTOXICATING BY VOLUME SO GENERALLY THERE'S BEEN A BELIEF THAT NEEDS TO BE MORE CLOSELY REGULATED AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT IS A PATTERN THAT. THAT THAT -- FLOWS THROUGH ALL STATES -- REGULATORY SYSTEMS -- WHETHER THAT SOMETHING THAT IS -- APPROPRIATE ANYMORE IS XIN WORTH ASKING BUT GENERALLY IT'S BEEN THE VIEW THAT IT IS A IT'S A MORE DANGEROUS PRODUCT JUST BECAUSE OF ITS ALCOHOL CONTENT -- WE LICENSE ALL SORTS OF THINGS FROM AIRPLANES TWO SHIPS ARE WE LICENSE -- GOLF CART ON GOLF COURSES WE HAVE EIGHTY SEVEN KINDS OF LICENSES ON THE MOST RECENTLY CREE RECREATED WAS FOR A CEMETERY IN LOS ANGELES -- SO LOTS AND LOTS OF DIFFERENT KINDS OF LICENSES I MEAN THEY HAVE SOME COMMONALITIES TO THEM. THERE EITHER REACH SOME KIND OF A RETAIL LICENSE LIKE A LIQUOR STORE OR A CRUISE SHIP WERE THERE CERTAIN ESSENTIALLY SERVING IT. FOR TO THE CONSUMER -- THEIR DISTRIBUTOR -- DRIVING TRUCKS AROUND THE STATE DELIVERING AND OR THEIR MANUFACTURER LIKE THAT -- CATTLE UP AT THE TOP OR THE OR THE THE WINE GRAPES NOT IN THE LOWER LEFT HAND CORNER -- WE HAVE NINETY TWO THOUSAND LICENSES IN THE STATE WE DO NOT LICENSE INDIVIDUALS SO THOSE ARE ACTUALLY NINETY TWO THOUSAND BUSINESSES -- SOME OF THOSE BUSINESSES HOLD A COUPLE LICENSES IN COMBINATION SO THEY CAN DO A FEW DIFFERENT THINGS -- BUT GENERALLY THERE ARE JUST PLAIN A LOT OF LICENSES -- AND ALL OF THOSE ARE ONES THAT -- WE DO BACKGROUND INVESTIGATIONS ON AND AND GET THEM IN THE BUSINESS. AND THEN THE RENEWAL AND RENEW EVERY YEAR -- WE DO NOT DO ANY -- ASSESSMENT OF THEM WHEN THEY RENEW IT'S JUST AN AUTOMATIC PROCESS -- BECAUSE YOU CAN SEE WE HAVE RESTAURANTS FORTY FIVE THOUSAND OF THEM ABOUT A THIRD OF THOSE ARE ONES THAT SERVE HOW HARD ALCOHOL IN THE OTHER TWO THIRDS ARE NOT PERMITTED TO BUY THEIR LICENSE OTHER EITHER SELLING BEER WINE BEER AND WINE -- BARS CLUBS MARKETS IT CETERA -- THE NON RETAILERS ARE -- YOU CAN SEE HIM AT THE BOTTOM HOME -- THEY A LOT OF THOSE REACHED OF NON RETAILERS -- THE EXCUSE ME THE WITH THE WINERIES BREWERIES IN STORES SOME OF THOSE ACTUALLY HAVE RETAIL OPERATIONS SO THAT'S WHY YOU CAN GO INTO A WINERY IN YOU CAN. TASTE ONE YOU CAN BUY WINE IF EVER RESTAURANT YOU CAN SIT DOWN THEIR NEED AND DRINKING EVEN DRINK OTHER PEOPLE'S WINE THERE -- SO THERE'S SOME BLURRING NOW OF THE PURE. I'M A MANUFACTURER VERSES I'M A RETAILER AND THAT'S AN EXAMPLE OF IT -- WITH THIRTEEN THOUSAND LICENSES A YEAR -- AND IN GENERALLY YOU WERE WERE PRETTY QUIRK PRETTY GOOD ABOUT TIMELY MOVING THEM ON WE DO HAVE SLOW DOWNS AND ALL AND SOME AREAS WERE. IMPACTED WERE TENDS TO BE. MORE CONTENTIOUS MORE COMPLICATED LOS ANGELES IS ALWAYS EXAMPLE I USE JUST BECAUSE THERE THERE ARE VERY COMPLEX LOCAL PROCESSES. AND THERE ARE THERE ARE TEND TO BE A LOT OF PROTESTS PARTLY BECAUSE THE COMPACTION OF IT ALSO TRUE IN SAN DIEGO -- NO INTO TV CAN EITHER ISSUE OR TAKE AWAY ON ALCOHOL LICENSE OTHER THAN THE A. B. C.. NOW LOCALS CAN LIMóN IT BY TAKING LIMITED BY ZONING TAKEN DECLINED ISSUE IS C. U. P. -- THERE'S OTHER THINGS THAT THEY CAN DO IF THEY DON'T WANT ALCOHOL IN THEIR AREA -- THEY ALSO LOOK WILL CLOSE A LOT OF TIMES PROTEST -- AND WE WORK CLOSELY WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND LAW ENFORCEMENT IN PARTICULAR TO TRY TO RESOLVE THE ISSUES THE LOCAL COMMUNITIES HAVE REGARDING ISSUES THEY WANT TO PROTEST. THAT ARE WE KNOW. THANK YOU MISTER I JUST A SPECIFIC TO THAT AND ABOUT A THANK YOU -- FOR IN TERMS OF WHEN THERE ARE PROTESTS. WHEN I WAS ON THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS IN SAN FRANCISCO WE HAD A COUPLE OF SITUATIONS? WHERE THE OUR LOCAL POLICE -- A CAPTAIN OR THE LOCAL STATION AND SIGNED OFF ON WHATEVER THE LICENSE WAS OF THE MODIFICATION OF THE HOURS MODIFICATION -- BUT ABC WOULD REJECT -- BASED ON LIKE ONE NEIGHBOR PROTESTING AND WHERE AND WE YOU KNOW PUTTING ASIDE WHETHER IT'S EVER. FAIR TO DENY PROTEST BASED ON WHAT LIKE ONE NEIGHBOR. PROTESTING. AGAINST MY QUESTION IS -- ARE HEALTH COMMON IS THE A. B. C. WOULD BASICALLY OVERRIDE WHAT THE LOCAL POLICE ARE SAYING IS IS OKAY AND THE NA AND DENY A PERMIT -- G. IT'S NOT THAT COMMON -- BECAUSE THE THAT THOSE ARE THEY ARE VERY FEW AND FAR BETWEEN MOSTLY BECAUSE ONE OF THE THINGS ARE LICENSING PEOPLE REALLY TRY TO DO IS WORK WITH THOSE PROTESTS AND AND THE AND THE LICENSEE AND THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO SEE IF THEY CAN GET COMPROMISES. BY -- REDUCING THE AMOUNT OF NO HOURS -- OTHER CONDITIONS THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY PUT ON A LICENSE IT'S REALLY THE RARE SEARCHES CIRCUMSTANCE WHERE WE GET THAT FAR BUT IT DOES HAPPEN -- AND OUT SAID I'VE REALLY TRIED TO MOVE US TO A MORE WHOLE HOLISTIC REVIEW OF APPROACH AND MORE ONE QUICK EXAMPLE IS -- I ISSUE DECISION WHICH IS PRESIDENTIAL AND HAS THE EFFECT OF A REGULATION WHEREBY -- INSTEAD OF JUST LOOKING AT ONE PROTEST WHICH IS WHAT THE STATUTE SEEMS TO IMPLY AS A RULE WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT THE TOTALITY OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES AND ENCOURAGING PEOPLE TO BRING FORWARD NEIGHBORS WHO ACTUALLY THINKS THAT IT'S A COMMUNITY BENEFIT NOT JUST GO WITH ONE PERSON DOESN'T LIKE. IT. ERICA COULD DECIDE NOT. TO BY OFFICE ABSOLUTELY OF A GREAT THANK YOU. CENTER BORDERS. I JUST FOLLOWING UP ON ALWAYS LIKE A QUESTION [inaudible] YEAH -- HAVING ALSO SERVED ON THE LOCAL LEVEL ON THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS IN CENTRAL VALLEY -- WE HAD WHAT WAS ESSENTIALLY A PRESUMPTION OF DENIAL. THAT WHEN THERE WERE X. NUMBER OF PERMITS ISSUED ANY GIVEN LOCALE. ANY APPLICATION THEREAFTER WAS PRESUMED TO BE DENIED. SOME OF OVER RIDE. YES YOU CAN DESCRIBE. IF WE'RE DEFERRING TO LOCAL AUTHORITIES TO MAKE THESE DECISIONS [inaudible] AND THERE'S A PRISON WE WERE WE WERE TOLD AND TELL ME IF I'M MISTAKEN WE WERE TOLD THAT ABC HAD THE BIRDS THE PRESUMPTION OF DENIAL. ONCE YOU EXCEED A NUMBER PERMITS IN A GIVEN -- ZIP CODE ZONE OR WHATEVER WAS YOU EXPLAIN THAT FOR SURE SO SO THERE'S THERE'S PRESUMPTIONS IF THERE'S AND IF THERE'S AN OVER CONCENTRATION OF LICENSES OR THE LICENSES ON OUR WAY WHAT IS DEEMED AS A HIGH CRIME DISTRICT -- UNFORTUNATELY THE HIGH CRIME DISTRICT A LOT OF TIMES JUST COINCIDES WHERE PEOPLE WANT TO BE RIGHT BECAUSE PEOPLE BREAK INTO CARS MORE OFTEN IN DOWNTOWN SACRAMENTO WHERE I LIVE I DON'T CONSIDER TO BE A CRIME INVESTIGATION MANY BETTER RULE READS THAT WAY. AND IF THAT IS TRUE THEN THERE NEEDS TO BE CITY. TO JUSTIFY THE ISSUANCE OF A LICENSE AND THERE ALSO NEEDS TO THERE ALSO IS A PRESUMPTION THAT WOULD THEY HAVE TO CHAU QUIET AND THE LICENSEE HAS TO SHOW THEIR WILL INTERFERE WITH A QUIET ENJOYMENT OF THE NEIGHBORS IF THERE ARE FACT RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORS WHICH IS SIMILAR TO WHAT. SENIOR WIENER WAS ASKING SO WE HAVE RESTRICTIONS ON WHAT WE CAN DO. BUT AGAIN WE REALLY TRY TO WORK WITH APPLICANTS -- TO BRING THEIR APPLICATION FORWARD IN A WAY THAT IT WAS ME IT'S MOST LIKELY TO BE GRANTED IF IT'S IN FACT SOMETHING THAT CAN FIT WITH A LOCAL COMMUNITY. THAT'S INTERESTING PHRASES BEEN DESCRIBED IS ESSENTIALLY FOOTLOOSE. THERE'S CATEGORICAL DENIALS AND THE BURDEN OF PERSUASION -- TO TO SHOWN NECESSITY OR JUSTIFICATION OF SOME KIND MADE IT VERY VERY DIFFICULT AND JUST KIND OF SAID I DIDN'T KNOW THE NEXUS BETWEEN A. B. C. THE STATE AND AND THERE'S AND THERE'S DIED NOT TO GET TOO MUCH IN THE WEEDS BUT FRESNO IS A GOOD EXAMPLE IN. OTHERS PARTS OF FRIENDS NUMBER PEOPLE BEEN REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT LIQUOR STORES AND SO THERE THERE'S NOT A LOT OF PUBLIC SUPPORT OR EVEN LOCAL GOVERNMENTS SUPPORT FOR NEW LIQUOR STORES IN SOME OF THOSE NEIGHBORHOODS. BUT I WOULD SAY THATIN RESTAURANTS HOWEVER MIGHT BE A GOOD THING FOR THOSE NEIGHBORHOODS BECAUSE ACTUALLY BRING JOBS IN THEM AND SOME OTHER LIFE THAN A PERSON WHO JUST WANTS TO PICK UP. CHEAP VODKA AT THE CORNER. THANK YOU CENTER ONE THANK YOU -- WOULD YOU GIVE ME AN EXAMPLE OF PERHAPS THE LICENSE BE FROZEN. OR YOU HAVE ONE PROPRIETOR WHO HAD PROBLEMS AS WE JUST HEARD -- PERSONAL ISSUES WHAT HAVE YOU IN THE NEXT PROPRIETOR WHOSE CLEAN AND AND IT'S PAST BACKGROUND WITH THE LICENSE. MAY NOT BE GIVEN TO THE LOCATION OR THE CITY BECAUSE OF SOME ISSUES. THAT'LL BE. A LICENSES SO ROTTEN THAT IT ACTUALLY SHOULD BE REVOKED AND HAVE THAT. THAT -- THAT OWNER OUT OF THERE REVOKE IT OUT RIGHT WITHOUT ALLOWING IT TO BE TRANSFERRED UNLESS THE LOCALS DON'T WANT TO TRANSFER THEY JUST THINK THE CORNER. IS SO BAD THEY JUST NEED TO CLEAN IT UP. THAT THERE MIGHT BE AN EXCEPTION GENERALLY WHAT WE'LL DO IS WE'LL REVOKE IT. AND GIVE THE PERSON SO MUCH TIME TRANSFERRED WHILE THE BUSINESSES SHUT DOWN SO THAT SO THAT. SO THAT WE DON'T LOSE THE ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES IN THE BUSINESS AND LET ME JUST SORT OF SAY GENERALLY WE'RE VERY LOW'S TO SHUT DOWN BUSINESSES WE ARE MINDFUL THAT. THAT PEOPLE ARE PUT OUT OF WORK WE TRY TO LOOK FOR OTHER THINGS. TOO TO DO SHORT OF THAT TO HYPOTHETICALLY FOR WERE LIQUOR STORE ON THE CORNER OF SEVENTH AND BROAD WAY I PATHETICALLY. AND THERE WAS CRIME ISSUES AND SO ON AND OF COURSE YOU. WITH THE THE COMMUNITY AND SOME WOULD YOU WITH THAT AND I USUALLY FREEZE IT AND THEN. MAYBE  COUPLE YEARS LATER THEIR REAPPLY -- IN YOU WOULD RECONSIDER. WELL WE WE IT WE WOULDN'T EVEN DO THAT OUT WE WOULD ACTUALLY DO HOPE THAT THERE WAS SOME BUT IF BUYER IF IT WAS A BUSINESS THAT SHOULD BE RESUSCITATED AND SO THE BUSINESS WOULD REALLY. PROCEED SEAMLESSLY WHAT WE WOULD DO WHEN IT WAS TRANSFERRED DOWN WAS WE WOULD LOOK TO SEE WHAT THE PROBLEMS WERE AND THEN PUT CONDITIONS ON SO MAYBE THEY HAVE PROBLEMS WITH LOITERING. MAYBE THEY NEEDED SECURITY MAYBE THEY BECAUSE OF SOME KIND THAT WEREN'T WEREN'T HELPING THE NEIGHBORHOOD SO WE WOULD LOOK FOR THOSE SORTS OF THINGS. TO CONDITIONS TO PUT ON A NEW OWNER SO THAT THOSE PROBLEMS WOULD BE AVOIDED UNDER NEW OWNERSHIP [inaudible] YES. THE RUBIO THANK YOU I HAVE A QUESTION IN TERMS OF NEW INDUSTRIES WHAT IS A. B. C. DOING. TO THE THEIR MONITOR OUR LOOK AHEAD AND TRY. TO FOR EXMPLE UBER EATS THESE DELIVERY SERVICES THAT DELIVER I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S ALLOWED THE CAN GIVE ME SOME INFORMATION TERMS OF WHAT WE'RE DOING. TO SO WE DON'T -- WE WE WE HAVE A WE HAVE A DEFICIT IN OUR ABILITY. TO WITH TO TO HAVE REGULATIONS REGARDING THOSE ISSUES -- AND THAT'S JUST A A JUST A RESOURCES ISSUE FOR US WHICH IS NOT A GOOD THING. BUT SO WHAT WE'VE DONE WITH ALL THOSE -- MANY OF THOSE COMPANIES AS WE'VE ACTUALLY MET WITH THEM TO TO LOOK AT THEIR BUSINESS MODELS THEY HAVE BEEN VERY COOPERATIVE WITH THIS WE PROBABLY MET WITH A HALF DOZEN -- DELIVERY SERVICE IS A VERY KIND OR ITS GROCERY STORES IT CETERA -- AND THEY'VE BEEN VERY COOPERATIVE WITH US AND TRIED TO COMPLY WITH THE PRINCIPLES OF MAKING SURE THAT THOSE THAT SALES WERE CONDUCTED PROPERLY AND THAT THE PRODUCTS ARE NOT BEING DIVERTED TO KIDS AND TOOK OVER INTOXICATED PEOPLE AND OTHER PEOPLE REALLY SHOULDN'T BE MY ALCOHOL OR COULDN'T PH#N ACTUALLY. WALKED INTO A BUSINESS SO WE'VE ACTUALLY HAD NO ISSUES NO PROBLEMS WHATSOEVER NO COMPLAINTS I'D. I THINK THAT A LOT OF THAT HOUSE TO DO WITH THE FACT THAT WE'VE BEEN VERY PROACTIVE IN THE INDUSTRY HAS BEEN RESPONSIVE TO THAT. THING CAM [inaudible] OKAY. OKAY -- SO I'VE I'VE KIND OF SAID THIS A LITTLE BIT ON A MODEL TO SEE I USED TO BE THE CHIEF OF THE BUREAU OF GAMBLING CONTROL -- AND I AND I AND I JUST WANT TO TRY TO WE TRY TO BE VERY PRACTICAL AS REGULATORS. AND I JUST USE THE EXAMPLE OF PIKE HELP POKER WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT -- EVER BEEN IN A CAR ROOM SOME IDIOT AND TRICK OR TRAVEL BECAUSE HIS IT'S REALLY FASCINATING GAME AND IT'S BEEN WHILE THERE ARE THERE'S PEOPLE ALL OVER THE PLACE IT'S HARD TO FOLLOW. AND SO WHEN I WAS IN A GAMBLING TO TROLL MY MY AGENTS REALLY WANTED ME TO SLAP OF MUCH OF RULES ON PUTTING OUT POKER TO SAY. HE CAN'T BET ON THAT HAND YOU CAN'T THAT ON THIS HANDICAP IN ON THAT HAND EYE SYMBOL WHO REALLY CARES ABOUT ALL THIS. THE OWNERS OF THE CLUBS DON'T CARE OF THE PATRONS ARE HAVING A GOOD TIME WE'RE NOT SEEING GUN FIGHTS IN CARP ROOM SO WHY ARE WE GONNA PUT MUCH REGULATIONS ON IT. AND WAS REALLY ONLY BECAUSE MY AGENTS WANTED REGULATIONS ON AND I'M NOT TRYING. TO GET MY CHEAP SHOT BUT BUT IT REALLY WHERE WE CAN BE PRACTICAL HOW WE CAN TRY TO GET TO AS LONG AS THOSE GAMES FOR SAFE AND UNDER CONTROL EVEN IF MAYBE. WE DON'T UNDERSTAND THE MORE. ISN'T REALLY THE POINT RIGHT THERE THEIR GREAT GAMES ARE WONDERFUL GAMES AND THEIR COLORFUL AND THEY WORK AND WE ARE THIS STAND BACK FROM IT EVEN THOUGH IT KIND OF MAKES THIS LITTLE NERVOUS BECAUSE IT'S A LITTLE WILD -- STORE AGENCIES AGAIN WE HAVE OR ABOUT HALF SWORN THEIR STRAIGHT UP FULL ON PEACE OFFICERS -- THEY HAVE ALL PEACE OFFICER POWERS WERE FOCUSED IN AROUND LICENSES TALISMANS BUT WE DO SAID ON TASK FORCE AND DO A LOT OF OTHER THINGS -- WE DO A LOT OF CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS IN AROUND -- ALCOHOL ESTABLISHMENTS -- TO HUMAN TRAFFICKING NARCOTICS AND GAMBLING -- ANYTHING THAT IS MAKING A ALCOHOLICS DOWN ASTONISHMENT YOU'RE RESPONSIBLE -- OR OTHERWISE ROTTEN OR NEIGHBORHOOD PROBLEM -- WE ARE GENERALLY IN PLAIN CLOTHES TIONS -- WHEN WE DO THINGS LIKE SERVICE SEARCH WARRANTS SPEND WERE ACTUALLY IN HOT HIGH PROFILE A TIRE -- WE DO -- LOTS A LOT LIKE I SAID LOTS DRUG CASES THOSE ARE A BUNCH OF GUNS WE GOTTEN COUNTRY COSTA COUNTY OUT OF A OUT OF A AND A LEGAL STILL OPERATION -- ONE OF THE THINGS I AM YOU KNOW LIKE ALL STATE AGENCIES WERE ALWAYS CHALLENGE FOR THE RESOURCES DAHLE TELL YOU ONE OF THE THINGS ARE REALLY BLESSED WITH AS I A FANTASTIC PEOPLE. LOVE OUR DEPARTMENT -- WHICH IS REALLY -- JUST TO JUST OF SAYS THE GREAT THING ABOUT I'M VERY PROUD ABOUT US -- ARRESTED THIRTY TWO HUNDRED PEOPLE LAST YEAR -- LOT OF IT HAVING TO DO WITH SALES TO MINORS ARMS YOU EXPECT AND WE INSPECTED -- THIRTY EIGHT THOUSAND OF ARE -- NINETY TWO THOUSAND LICENSEES. THESE ARE A FEW OF OUR PROGRAMS WITH THE OBLIGATORY -- ACRONYMS THAT ALL COPS LIKE TO USE -- BUT I WON'T TALK ABOUT ALL OF THEM ALL JUST FOCUS ON TO THE I'LL CALL POLICING PARTNERSHIP IS REALLY A FORCE MULTIPLIER FOR US SO WE GIVE -- GRANTS TO JURISDICTIONS THROUGHOUT THE STATE ABOUT USUALLY ABOUT SIXTY EVERY YEAR -- AND IT'S NOT JUST GIVING THE MONEY WITH THEM IN THE FIELD TO TEACH ME HOW TO DO ALCOHOL CASES THEY DO MY ENERGY COURT CASES THEY DO SHOULDER TAPS -- THEY DO SOME DISORDERLY HOUSES CASES WHICH ARE COMMONLY -- ONES WITH HUMAN TRAFFICKING IN THEM -- SO IT'S AND IT'S OUR IT'S OUR HOPE THEN THAT THE TAKE THAT WORK AND FOR THE RENT -- IN THEIR OWN -- AND THEIR OWN DEPARTMENTS -- AND WE IT THIS YEAR WE'RE GIVING OUT THREE MILLION DOLLARS AS PART OF THIS PROGRAM -- ARE TRACE INVESTIGATIONS -- TARGET RESPONSE ALCOHOL CONNECTED EMERGENCIES IS NOT TERRIBLE BUT IT'S ACTUALLY AN INCREDIBLY GOOD PROGRAM MORE. IF THERE IS A IN ON MINOR INVOLVED IN AN ACCIDENT WITH SERIOUS BODILY INJURY OR DEATH -- WE WE WE INVESTIGATED AND TRACE THE I'LL CALL IF WE CAN BACK TO THE SOURCE -- IT SO IT'S SOMETHING WE DO ON THE SPOT. IT WOULD BE WITH IT USES LOCAL DEPARTMENTS ALL OVER THE STATE WE RIGHT NOW WE'RE DOING A PROGRAM OR WERE DOING -- ROLL CALL BRIEFINGS TO GET THERE'S A KID INVOLVED WITH ALCOHOL ON AN ACCIDENT. THEY NEED TO CALL US BECAUSE WE CAN ALL A LOT OF TIMES TRAYS THAT ALCOHOL IN THE SALES BACK TO AN ESTABLISHMENT WHERE IT CAME FROM. YES SIR SURE THANK YOU RESTRUCTURING IN THE IN THE LAW ENFORCEMENT WORLD OF COURSE WE'RE ALWAYS CONCERNED ABOUT. OFFICER SAFETY AND I KNOW THAT THE THE OFFICERS TO THE B. C. HAVE FULL POLICE POWERS. IN IN THEIR COURSE OF INVESTIGATION AND THEY DISCOVER SOMETHING YOU CAN SEE THE OFFICER -- HANDCUFFED IN THAT INDIVIDUAL. WOULD YOU. WOULD THERE BE AN INVESTIGATION THAT WE HE WOULD WALK IN AND THEN FULFILL THAT INVESTIGATION THROUGH ARREST. OR WHAT HE TEAM UP WITH LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AND RAID SO THERE WOULD BE MORE POLICE OFFICERS AND JUST ONE OR TWO THAT MAY CAUSE SOME PROBLEMS. YOUR TYPICALLY -- DEPENDING ON THE MAGNITUDE OF THE ISSUES YES WE WE TEAM OF LOCAL ON FOR SINCE ALL MANY TIMES -- WE COMMONLY IN SERVING SEARCH WARRANTS ESPECIALLY IN CROWDED AREAS WE WE GENERALLY HAVE A LOCAL POLICE WITH US -- SOMETIMES REAR IT FOR TACTICAL REASONS OF OUR OWN -- OR IF IT'S SOMETHING WE CAN MANAGE WITH THE STAFF OF AN OFFICE BUT WE WE REALLY TRIED ALL PARTNER WITH LOCAL POLICE EVERYWHERE WE CAN -- THAT THEY REALLY RELY ON IS TO A LARGE EXTENT BECAUSE VERY FEW DEPARTMENTS ANYMORE HAVE TRUE ALCOHOL VICE UNITS -- SAN FRANCISCO -- SACRAMENTO -- LA DO BUT A LOT OF PLACES -- YOU KNOW THEY'RE SO STRAIN FOR RESOURCES IF THERE'S A BAR THAT'S A PROBLEM. THEY REALLY POINT TO US TO DEAL WITH IT -- AND WE DO. HELP US BUT IT IT'S REALLY ARE IN THEIR VIEW OUR RESPONSIBILITY AND WE TAKE THAT VERY SERIOUSLY THANK YOU. THANK IN A REVIEW OF WHAT THE RISE OF THE CANNABIS INDUSTRY IN THE IN THE POPULARITY AND ACCESSIBILITY IS THERE ANYTHING THAT WE NEED TO BE DOING IN TERMS OF MONITORING. HOW THESE TWO INDUSTRIES MAKE CROSSOVER? WE ARE MONITORING THAT REALLY CLOSELY -- OUR GOAL HAS BEEN TO MAKE PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THAT THE PRODUCTS ARE LEGAL. NAY SHOULD NOT BE COMBINED IN. ON ALCOHOL ESTABLISHMENT -- OR SHOULD NOT BE COMBINED WITH ALCOHOL IF PEOPLE WANT TO TAKE THE TWO OF MY HOME AND THEY CAN DO IT UP THAT'S THEIR RIGHT THEY CAN DO THAT IF THEY WANT TO BUT WITH THE LEADS THOSE THOSE STATUTORY SCHEME IS REALLY CLEAR THAT THEY NEED TO BE SEPARATED. SO WE HAVE SENT OUT ADVISORIES WE'VE SENT WARNINGS TO LICENSEES OF OURS WHO REALLY SEEM TO WANT TO COMBINE THE TWO PRODUCTS THAT I MEAN IN A VERY ENTREPRENEURIAL WAY I DON'T THINK THERE ARE YOU KNOW THEY'RE TRYING TO BE -- CROOKS OR ANYTHING BUT WE'RE JUST REALLY -- THIS BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT THIS TO GET AWAY FROM US AND AND IN INDUSTRY TO ADD TO RISE UP THOSE ESSENTIALLY COMBINING THE PRODUCTS. UNLESS OF COURSE THE LEGISLATURE DECIDES THAT'S OKAY FOR RIGHT NOW WILL THE MESSAGE IS CLEAR KEEP THEM SEPARATE. SO WE OF BEEN REALLY WORKING HARD TO KEEP OUR LICENSEES OUT OF TROUBLE WHEN THEY'RE TRYING TO MAKE COCKTAILS WITH CANNABIS AND THEM AND ANALYZE ONLY BETWEEN TWO AND FOUR AM IN CERTAIN CITIES ARE. THAT'S CORRECT. FIVE TO MISTER CHAIRMAN BACK. ON HAT YEAH SO -- AS ONE OUT OF A HUNDRED TWENTY LEGISLATORS I I THINK THAT THIS SHARP. LIKE. THE TO SHALL NOT EVER MEET I THINK IT IS NOT A CRITICISM A. B. C. IT'S THE LAW IS THE LAW AND I HOPE WE CHANGE OUR ITS IRRATIONAL -- AYE AYE AND THERE WAS A BILL I THINK LAST YEAR I DON'T REMEMBER THE GOVERNOR SIGNED THAT I VOTED AGAINST. TO THE YOU CAN EVEN CHOOSE ALCOHOL WITH WITH ANYTHING FROM CANNABIS EVEN IF HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH INTOXICATION WE ARE -- ABSOLUTELY STIFLING INNOVATION AND THEN THE IDEA THE IN TERMS OF WHERE PEOPLE ARE SUPPOSED TO CONSUME CANNABIS WE DON'T WANT THEM DOING ON THE STREET -- YOU HAVE YOUR PEOPLE. YOU KNOW PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO BE THE OLD PEOPLE SMOKING. AND THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY CAN PROVIDE THAT IT CAN BE DONE I I THINK A SAFE. WAY -- SO I HOPE WE MOVE AWAY FROM THE SHARP CANNABIS IS YOUR ALCOHOL IS HERE AND THE WORLD WILL AND IF THEY COME TOGETHER -- AND JUST A REAL QUICK REFERENCE -- WE HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF AN UNUSUAL -- DISCIPLINARY -- SYSTEM -- SO THIS IS FOR IF WE TAKE ACTION AGAINST A LICENSE OR LICENSES TONIGHT -- I HAVE MY OWN PROSECUTORS AT MY OWN JUDGES AND ACTUALLY MAKE ALL THE DECISIONS MYSELF SO. I IT'S OF IT'S VERY MUCH OF A PERSONAL ATTENTION TO DETAIL THAT I TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR ALL OF THESE THINGS -- AND SO MY MAKE A LOT. COUPLE HUNDRED DECISIONS BASED ON JUDGES ON RECOMMENDATIONS TO ME EVERY YEAR -- AND THEN OBVIOUSLY THEY HAVE AN APPEAL TO AN APPEALS BOARD -- LET ME SEE SAY SOMETHING A LITTLE BIT ROB REGULATION THIS IS SORT OF A SEGUE INTO TIGHT HOUSE. GENERALLY MOST PEOPLE THINK ALCOHOL S REGULATED IN THE RIGHT WAY IF YOU TAKE A POLL FROM -- I THINK THEY RECOGNIZE THAT IT'S A PRODUCT THAT HAS SOCIETAL PROBLEMS IF IF LEFT UNFETTERED -- IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT THEIR CONCERNS ARE DRUNK DRIVING AN UNDERAGE DRINKING RIGHT UP THERE AT THE TOP. THERE A LITTLE LESS CONCERN INTERESTINGLY ABOUT LOWERING PRICES WHICH IS GENERALLY THE HUGE IN THE ARGUMENTS YOU HERE -- FOR FOR DEREGULATING PRODUCTS -- AND THE INDUSTRY ITSELF VERY MUCH SUPPORTS OUR DEPARTMENTS -- AND REGULATION AND WHY BECAUSE IT'S IS A IS A QUOTE ON QUOTE SAN INDUSTRY RIGHT. BAD STORIES. ARE THEY'RE THE ONES WE'RE GONNA GET PICKED ON FIRST THERE'S NOTHING THEY FEAR MORE THAN TAXATION REALLY OR UNDUE REGULATION -- AND THAT IS BECAUSE IT'S A PRODUCT THAT TRADITIONALLY HAS BEEN SOMETHING THAT WHEN THINGS GO BAD. SOMEONE WANTS TO REGULATE THEM OR TAX THEM -- AND THEY'RE ALSO GENERALLY A LOT OF THEM SPECIALLY MID TO SMALL BUSINESSES. REGULATION IS IS FOR THEM A GUARD AGAINST UNFAIR COMPETITION. THE DIRECTOR I JUST WANTED TO MAKE A POINT THAT. I DIDN'T WANT ANY THE NEW A. B. C. REGULATES MARIJUANA -- YEAH WHILE I HOPE TO THE DEPARTMENT OF BEER OF KICK CANNABIS CONTROL REGULATES MARIJUANA -- IS EFFECTIVELY AS THE A. B. C. DOES -- ALCOHOL. IT'S A TOTALLY DIFFERENT DEPARTMENT. I GERMAN PLEASE AT NIGHT RECOGNIZED OUT BUT DOT COMING FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENT WHERE WE HAD ISSUED PERMITS THERE'S ALWAYS THE THE BAD ACTOR AND THE AND THE POOL OF PEOPLE THAT WANT TO DO THE RIGHT THING AT THE RIGHT TIME AND SO WE'VE EXPERIENCED SOME. SOME ISSUES SO I WAS JUST WONDERING IF YOU HAD COME ACROSS ANYTHING THAT. KIND OF LEADS US TO BELIEVE THAT WE NEED TO BE LIKE MARK AND THE ONLY THING AND ADD TO THAT IS. THERE'S A LOT OF SMOKE AROUND THIS ISSUE PARDON THE PUN -- WE'VE FOUND VERY LITTLE ACTUAL CROSSOVER IT'S BEEN MOSTLY. PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT AN ARTICLE SPRING UP ABOUT IT -- SO HERE AGAIN SO NOW WHAT'S THE DATE BACK TO THE TIED HOUSE -- IN AGAIN A TIGHT HOUSE MEANS A MANUFACTURER. AND THE HOUSE THAT SELLS ALCOHOL ARE TIED TOGETHER -- INCLUDED IN THIS -- SYSTEM IS A* WHOLESALERS SO IMPURE TIGHT HOUSE SYSTEM. NO MANUFACTURER WHOLESALER RETAILER CAN HAVE ANY OWNERSHIP OR CONTROL OVER ANY OTHER TEAR. AND THE IDEAS THIS CREATES ORDERLY DISTRIBUTION AT PRESENT IT PREVENTS ACCESS. SO AGAIN BACK TO THE BACK TO THE OLD DAYS -- IN IN TO ONE OF THE REASONS TIED HOUSES WERE SO CONCERNING IS THAT -- THERE WERE FEARS COMPETITIONS PARTICULAR MUNK BREWERIES -- AND THEY ESSENTIALLY WOULD PUT SALOONS OR OR BARS AND TO BUSINESS -- AND THEY WOULD SOMETIMES BY THE EQUIPMENT SOMETIMES BY ALL THE GLASSWARE ON BETWEEN NINE AND EIGHTEEN NINETY FIVE IN NINETEEN OH FIVE THE SLITS BREWING COMPANY FOR THOSE OF US OLD ENOUGH TO REMEMBER SCHLITZ BEER -- THEY IN DISTRICT ONE NEIGHBOR SAYS I'M IN SOME NEIGHBORHOODS THERE WERE TWO HUNDRED PEOPLE FOR EVERY BAR -- THEY USE FREE LUNCHES PROSTITUTION GAMBLING ANYTHING THEY COULD TO COMPETE WITH EACH OTHER. AND TO TO SELL ALCOHOL A LOT OF TIMES SOME OF THESE COMPANIES WERE WERE -- FOREIGN OWNED OR NOT LOCALLY OWNED. THEY DIDN'T REALLY GIVE MUCH CARE ABOUT LOCAL COMMUNITIES THEY JUST HAD A PROFIT MOTIVE AND THAT PROFIT MOTIVE WAS WAS TO SELL ALCOHOL AS MUCH AS THEY COULD AND TO ELIMINATE THEIR COMPETITORS. SO WHEN -- PROHIBITION CAME OUT -- WHO'S VIEWED AS HAVING GONE TOO FAR -- THAT IT WAS WITH A REALLY NOT GOING TO CHANGE TEN THOUSAND YEARS OF HUMAN HISTORY -- THE STATE'S WERE ALLOWED TO REGULATE AS I SAID BEFORE. SO -- IN SOME STATES ARE COTROL STATES MEAN THEY ACTUALLY RUN THE LIQUOR STORES SOME OF A MORON ACTION THE WHOLESALERS SOME RUN BOWL JUST DEPENDS THERE'S ALL SORTS OF MODELS -- CALIFORNIA CHOSE TO NOT BE IN THE ALCOHOL BUSINESS BUT IT ACTUALLY HAD CHAU STRICT REGULATIONS AND ARE STRICT TIED HOUSE PROVISION SO NINETEEN THIRTY FIVE ONE OF MY AGENTS ACTUALLY FOUND THE ORIGINAL ACT.% HE WOULD LET ME BRING UP THE DID MAKE A COPY FOR ME SO THIS WAS HELP BEING THE A. B. C. ACT WAS IN NINETEEN THIRTY FIVE AND THE TIGHT HOUSE ROOM RULES. WORD ABOUT TWENTY SEVEN WORDS LONG WHICH SAID IF YOU'RE A RETAILER YOU CAN'T BE A MANUFACTURER FOR MANUFACTURE YOU CAN'T THE RETAILER FOR WHOLESALER ETCETERA. SO IT'S JUST ONE TINY LITTLE PROVISIONING HERE AND THIS IS MY ACT TODAY -- AND IT IS ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED PAGES LONG. SO IT IS ENORMOUSLY COMPLICATED -- LEE REGULAR WHO WE SHE'S THE HEAD OF OUR TRADING FORCED ME UNIT WHICH DEALS WITH TIGHT HOUSE -- UNFORTUNATELY SHE'S LIKE A WALKING -- YOU KNOW -- ALFIE KISS AND AND KNOWLEDGE OF ALL THINGS AND COMPUTER IN THIS -- BUT IT'S HARD TO FALL I MEAN IS THERE SOME BASIC THINGS ARE CLEAR. BUT THERE'S SOME OBSCURE THINGS THE TRIP UP VERY SOPHISTICATED PEOPLE. AND THAT'S NOT A THAT'S NOT A GOOD THING BUT BUT WE'VE CREATED EXCEPTIONS OVER THE YEARS AND VERY UNUSUAL SEARCHERS CIRCUMSTANCES THAT HAVE. UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES SUCH AS FIVE HUNDRED PAGES OF LAWS REGULATIONS. OF SERVER NOT NINE NINE THIS BUT I'M I MEAN TO THIS COMMITTEE -- WHAT WHAT IS IT THAT ALLOWS A -- LIKE A BREWERY TO SELL ALCOHOL ON THEIR OWN PREMISES AT A COMPETITIVE MICROBREWERY FOR EXAMPLE. SURE SO -- SO THERE'S THERE'S REALLY TWO WAYS SO -- THAT CAN BE A MENU FOR IT'S BASICALLY A MANUFACTURING LICENSE THEY HAVE TO MANUFACTURE ON THAT PROMISES AND THEN THEY'RE ALLOWED TO SELL THE BEER FOR CONSUMPTION ON THE PREMISES SO THE GOLDEN ROAD NINETEEN TO AND CON ELSTREE WHICH HAS BEEN IN THE NEWS -- THERE ALSO THE AND DOWNTOWN ONLY THAT'S OWNED BY ANHEUSER BUSCH THEY MAKE BEER THERE AND THEN THEY CAN SELL THEIR OWN BEER THERE -- THERE'S OTHER ONES THAT ARE ON LIKE A BREW PUB -- THEY HAVE TO MANUFACTURE BEER ON THE PREMISES -- AND WE'VE GIVEN THEM AN EXCEPTION TO BE A RETAILER OR WITHIN CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS AND LIMITS. WINERIES HAVEL HAVE MORE PRIVILEGES THAN ANY OF THE OTHER MANUFACTURERS THEY CAN ACTUALLY OWN LIQUOR STORES BUT ONLY ONCE IT'S SELL BEER AND WINE THEY CAN'T HAVE A LIQUOR STORE THAT -- CELLS HARD ALCOHOL -- THEY CAN THEN ALSO HAVE A RESTAURANT AND IF THEY HAVE A RESTAURANT THEY'RE ALLOWED TO SERVE OTHER PEOPLE'S WINE -- AS LONG AS IT COMES IN THE NORMAL DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS. AND ARE WE IN USUAL INTERNATIONALLY IN THIS I KNOW I THINK IN THE U. K. FOR EXAMPLE YOU HAVE BIG BREWERS WHO WILL. HAVE CONTRACTS WITH PUBS AND AN OLD THEN THE BASIC EXCLUSIVELY SELL THEIR THEIR BEERS I IS THAT CORRECT THAT IS CORRECT OKAY. IS THAT IS THAT IS THAT A COMMON MODEL IN EUROPE. IT'S A COMMON MODEL IN EUROPE IT'S COMMON MODEL IN THE WORLD -- MISSION DID NOT WANT. SO FOR EXAMPLE RIGHT NOW IN BRAZIL FEARS COPIES. MANAGER BUSH'S HEADQUARTERED IN BRAZIL -- AND HEINEKEN IS DECIDED THAT IT WANTS TO EDGE RAN AS A BOOKSHOP IN BRAZIL SO THE TWO COMPANIES ARE LITERALLY GOING AROUND AND THEY ARE PUTTING. THEIR PAYING BARS FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS TO CARRY ONLY THEIR PRODUCTS WE COULD HAVE TO DO THIS KIND OF THING SOME COKE AND PEPSI DO THIS KIND OF THING WHICH IS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY CODE. IF YOU GO TO A BIG SUPERMARKET. THERE'S MAYBE LIKE A COUPLE KINDS OF THERE'S A COUPLE MANUFACTURERS OF SODA POP AND THERE ARE SEVENTY FIVE MANUFACTURERS OF BEER. IN. AND THIS IS A THIS IS PRIMARILY A PRO COMPETITION. THANK ITS IT'S ORIGINS ARE INTEMPERANCE BUT IT HAS BECOME A FOR MORE OF A FAIR COMPETITION STATUTE VAN A TEMPERANCE STATUTE YASSIN'S PRACTICAL APPLICATION. I STILL I STILL THINK THEY'RE THE UNDERPINNINGS OF TEMPERANCE. IF IT WAS ELIMINATED PEOPLE MIGHT START TALKING ABOUT TEMPERANCE MORE BUT RIGHT NOW IT'S MOSTLY. FOR COMPETITION RIGHT OKAY -- AND THAT'S THE BANDS OF THE TIRE A SYSTEM PERMITS THE CREATION AND GROWTH OF CALIFORNIA SMALL BUSINESS. AND THE CRAPPER RESOURCE HERE SOMEWHERE THEY MAY STILL BE IN AS I ALWAYS SAY THE ONE OF THE REASONS THERE ARE THOUSAND CRAFTERS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS BECAUSE OF THE TITLE SYSTEM. THEY CAN ACTUALLY GET ON STORE SHELVES THEY CAN ACTUALLY MOVE THEIR PRODUCT THROUGH COMMERCE -- IT ALSO IS A SYSTEM THAT ALLOWS LOCAL INTERESTS TO BALANCE THEIR OWN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT WITH PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY. THEY'RE NOT. THEY'RE NOT THE RE PEOPLE SELLING ALCOHOL IN THEIR IN THEIR AREAS. NEED TO HAVE SOME LOCAL CONNECTIONS AS OPPOSED TO BEING CONTROLLED BY SOMEONE FAR AWAY WHO DOES NOT CARE ABOUT THE NEIGHBORHOOD -- AND IT'S A DIFFERENT EDITORS ON FOR COMPETITION [inaudible] FOR SURE -- COMMON THERE STILL BRIBERY EXTORTION. LOTS OF THERE'S STILL LOTS OF COMPETITION THE INDUSTRY. MORE COMMONLY IT'S CREATIVE APPROACHES OF ADVERTISING WAYS OF FUNNELING MONEY INTO FROM MANUFACTURERS TYPICALLY TUESDAY -- TO RETAILERS IN WAYS THAT -- SHORT OF BRIBES ARE -- DESIGNED TO CREATE A CONTROLLING RELATIONSHIP WHERE BY RETAILERS MORE LIKELY. TO CARRY THAT MANUFACTURES PRODUCT BECAUSE OF COMMERCIAL INCENTIVES AS OPPOSED. TO BY VIRTUE OF SUPPLY DEMAND ETCETERA [inaudible] YES. A QUICK QUESTION ON ON ON THAT LAST SLIDE. SO WHEN YOU GO INTO SUPER EIGHT WHEN YOU GO IN A CONVENIENCE STORE OR LIQUOR CORN LIQUOR STORE AND YOU SEE ALL OF THE NEON LIGHTS. OF ANY GIVEN PRODUCT -- I WAS TOLD THAT A LOT OF THE LARGER MANUFACTURES. GIFT OF THOSE. WORDS PART OF A IS THE IN INCENTIVE PACKAGE IS THAT ARE YOU SAYING THAT -- THAT THAT IS DISALLOWED UNDER THE PROMOTIONAL EVENTS OR EQUIPMENT OF COULD YET SO THE GENERAL RULE IS IT IS IS PROHIBITED -- BUT A VARIETY OF EXCEPTIONS HAVE ARISEN SO FOR EXAMPLE -- YOU'LL SEE LIKE BEER SIGNS IN A BAR THEY CAN HAVE CERTAIN TAKEN HAVE CERTAIN SIGNS AND CERTAIN AMOUNT OF SIGNAGE -- HE'LL SOMETIMES YOU'LL SEE REFER THERE'S AS LONG AS THE THE RETAILERS ACTUALLY PAYING THEM A LEASING FEE FOR THOSE REFRIGERATORS BUT THE REFRIGERATOR MIGHT SAY. YOU KNOW CORES LIGHT ON OR WHATEVER WOULD SAY SO THERE ARE THERE SO MANY EXCEPTIONS AND THEY'RE THEY'RE SO COMPLICATED. THAT TEY'RE REALLY DESIGNED TO ALLOW SOME CROSSOVER BUT NOT SO MUCH THAT THE MANUFACTURE. OF THE RETAILERS BEHOLDEN TO THE MANUFACTURER -- NOW THE FRUSTRATIONS -- THERE ARE LOTS OF FRUSTRATIONS ABOUT THIS IT'S VERY COUNTER INTUITIVE TO A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO WERE IN BUSINESS AND PARTICULARLY WE SEE FRUSTRATIONS AMONG -- IN -- CYBERSPACE WHO ARE AWARE OF NEW BUSINESS MODELS WERE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW THEY CAN. APPLY THE KINDS OF MARKETING PRACTICES THEY HAVE ANOTHER FOR AREAS TO ALCOHOL. AND THEY JUST OTHER JUST STYMIED BY THIS IDEA OF THE INABILITY OF MANUFACTURERS AND RETAILERS FOR EXAMPLE TO COORDINATE THEIR ADVERTISING -- THAT IS PROHIBITED -- SO IS SO WE GET A LOT OF THAT BUT AT THE SAME TIME WE ALSO REALLY REALLY TRY TO WORK WITH THEM. AND HELP THEM CREE BUSINESS MODEL SO THAT WILL BE SUCCESSFUL -- AND EVEN THOUGH SOMETIMES A LITTLE BIT CUMBERSOME FOR THEM WE GENERALLY OUR EXPERIENCES BEEN THAT WE CAN GET THEM TO THEIR WAY THEY WERE WHERE THEY WANTED TO GET. WHICH IS BEING -- WHICH IS WHICH IS APPROPRIATE PROMOTION OF MY AND MARKETING OF PRODUCTS -- IN AN EXPERIENCE FOR THE CA TO THEM. BUT IT'S COMPLICATED -- BUT WE REALLY DO TRY TO BE PROACTIVE WITH THEM AND HAVE AN OPEN DOOR AND I MEET WITH PEOPLE LIKE THIS VIRTUALLY EVERY SINGLE WEEK -- SO WE WILL A LOT OF PEOPLE WILL SAY TO ME WINE ARE TIGHT HOUSE LAW YOU KNOW LAWS JUST SORT OF A FUNCTION OF YOU KNOW A BIKE ON HERE -- AND AND MY ANSWER TO THAT IS ALWAYS. OBVIOUSLY ONE THE LEGISLATURE DECIDES WHAT THEY ARE. BUT A LOT OF IT IS JUST YOUR VIEW OF OF HOW WE SHOULD BE REGULATING SOMETHING THAT IS ESSENTIALLY AN INTOXICATING PRODUCT. AND ALSO WHAT INTEREST YOUR INDUSTRY INDUSTRY TO LIVE SO THOSE OF YOU WHO OR EXPERIENCE WITH US WE'LL KNOW THAT. FOR EVERY IDEA OF BREAKING TIED HOUSE TYPICALLY ONE OF THE TEARS LOBBYIST WILL SAY YOU SHOULDN'T DO THAT. AND THAT TEAR WILL THEN ALSO AND WE WANT TO DO SOMETHING AND THEN ANOTHER TEAR WILL NOT WANT YOU TO DO IT. HAD A LOT OF THAT AS PER PERSISTENCE IRVING THEIR TURF. RAIN -- AND FOR US IT'S YOU KNOW WE WE FALL THE STATUE AND IT'S AN TEN AND REALLY TRY -- TO KEEP THE TEARS SEPARATE TO THE DEGREE. THIS TELLS US TO DO IT RIGHT AND THAT ARE REAL OUR OVER ARCHING PRINCIPLE IS. ONE BUSINESS THAT YOU SHOULD NOT CONTROL ANOTHER BUSINESS WITHOUT A LICENSE. AND THAT'S KIND OF REALLY ARE SORT OF OUR BASE LINE FOR ALL THIS -- AND IT IT'S COMPLICATED BUT AGAIN WE REALLY TRY TO BE OUT IN FRONT AND HELP PEOPLE UNDERSTAND IT -- SOME SOME UNFAIR COMPETITION TRADE -- SOME ON SOME RETAILERS DON'T UNDERSTAND IT WHICH WE TRY TO EDUCATE THEM IF WE FIND THEM DOING THINGS THEY SHOULDN'T BE WE TYPICALLY JUST WARM IN TOWN THE KNOCK IT OFF FOR REALLY NOT. TRYING TO BE PUNITIVE FROM. THE TITLE SYSTEM IS IS WE TALK ABOUT FRACTURES CONTROLLING RETAILERS THAT IS IN A LOT OF WAYS JUST THE WAY RETAILERS CHANGE HAS FLIPPED. RIGHTS OF THE NOW RETAILERS THAT ARE SO BIG AND POWERFUL THAT THEY CAN ACTUALLY START CONTROLLING WHAT MANUFACTURERS ARE DOING. SO SO ARE MOST SOME OF OUR MOST RECENT INVESTIGATIONS IN FACT IN TERMS OF COMMERCIAL BRIBERY HAVE REALLY BEEN. WHERE MANUFACTURERS EVEN LARGE MANUFACTURERS HAVE BEEN? THE VICTIMS OF RETAILERS DEMANDING -- PAYMENTS IN KICKBACKS TO HAVE THEIR PRODUCTS ON THEIR SHELVES -- NON LICENSEES AS I WAS SAYING BEFORE LOTS OF PEOPLE WHO WANT YOU KNOW RUN A RUN AROUND AND CREATE AN APP THAT ALLOWS YOU TO DO A BUNCH OF THINGS ON THERE ARE ON THE PHONE. OR HOWEVER THEY WANT TO WANT TO DO IT -- THEY REALLY RUN INTO PROBLEMS WITH WITH THE THE PROHIBITIONS AGAINST ADVERTISING MARKETING BETWEEN BUSINESSES. BUT AGAIN I I I TRULY BELIEVE THAT FOR MOST OF THIS -- WE WE ARE ABLE TO GET OUT IN FRONT AND HELP THEM DESIGN MODELS THAT SAID. I DO THINK IT WOULD BE HELPFUL IF WE COULD AS AN AGENCY HAVE PROACTIVE REGULATIONS THAT WOULD SHOW PEOPLE HOW TO HOW THE RIGHT BUSINESS MODEL. UNLIKE MOST STATUTES WHERE -- IF THERE'S NOT A LAW AGAINST IT YOU CAN DO IT AND ALCOHOL THE THE LAW IS YOU CANNOT DO ANYTHING UNLESS THERE'S A LAW THAT SAYS YOU CAN. SO SO FOR US ACTUALLY WE THINK ROUTE REGULATIONS WE MOSTLY THINK ABOUT THEM IN TERMS OF TRYING TO HELP PEOPLE -- GIVE THEM GUIDELINES AND IS THAT HOW THEY CAN HAVE A LEGITIMATE BUSINESS IN THE WAY WITH A ONE AND THEN FINALLY LOTS AND LOTS AS I WAS SAYING WITH GIANT RETAILERS WERE JUST SEEING AN INCREASING NUMBER OF JUST PEOPLE. BASICALLY DELIBERATELY VIOLATING. HOUSE LOS -- AND BECAUSE I LIKE TO IN ON A POSITIVE NOTE. I'LL JUST IN WITH CHAMPAGNE -- CHAMPAGNE IS -- THE STILL LOW PARTS OF SILICON VALLEY I MEAN I'M NAPA VALLEY NOW COULD ARGUE -- THE TOTAL ON PROBABLY IS GREATER GREAT VALUE THEN -- CHAMPION BUT IT'S STILL THE THE THE BEST GREAT VALUE IN THE WORLD. AND IT IS THE MOST STRICTLY REGULATED AGRICULTURAL PRODUCT PROBABLY IN THE WORLD -- THERE IS A THERE ARE RULES ON HOW MANY. LINES YOU CAN PLANT HOW MANY IN -- THERE ARE RULES IN TERMS OF OUT ALL SORTS OF THINGS IN TERMS OF IF YOU CALL YOURSELF A CERTAIN KIND OF CHAMPAGNE WHAT WHAT HOW MUCH USED HAS TO BE IN IT. AND THEY THEY ARE THEY ARE VERY MUCH IN FAVOR OF THEIR SYSTEM AND THAT SYSTEM HAS WORK FOR THEM -- A BECAUSE THE INDUSTRY ITSELF IS SUPPORTIVE OF IT -- AND IS BEEN SUCCESSFUL SO IT'S AN UNUSUAL AREA IT'S AN UNUSUAL INDUSTRY -- IN THE SENSE THAT IT IS HIGHLY REGULATED. AND MOST PEOPLE IN IT. WOULD ARGUE THAT IT'S TO ITS BENEFITS SO. I'M NOT REALLY TRYING TO PUSH GOVERNMENT REGULATION GENERALLY BUT THIS IS THIS IS AN AREA WHERE IT IT DEMANDS SOME SECOND THOUGHT ABOUT ITS PRIORITY BECAUSE IT'S IT'S REALLY NOT TYPICAL. SO ANYWAY WITHOUT I'M MY COMMENTS ARE AN END UP ON HAPPY ANSWER ANY QUESTION THAT YOU DIRECTOR WE'VE GOT FIVE MINUTES SO I'M TO START OUT WITH SENATOR BRADFORD. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN ARE YOU SHOULD QUESTION AS RELATES TO DIVERSITY AND THE ABC HAVE ANY OVER. TO LOOK THAT LANDS BECAUSE WE SELL A LOT MORE MINORITY DISTRIBUTORS AND YOU SEEM LIKE THEY'VE GONE BY THE WAYSIDE SO IS THAT AREA OF CONCERN. FOR A. B. C. OR IS THAT MORE OF A CORPORATE DECISION ON WITH A CONTRACT YEAH IT'S REALLY MORE OF A CORPORATE DECISION WHO THE CONTRACT WITH THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF SICK CONSOLIDATION IN THE DISTRIBUTOR INDUSTRY AND I DON'T KNOW IF THAT. IS PART OF WHAT THE ISSUE IS -- WHAT I WOULD SAY IS JUST MORE% AND MORE IN TERMS OF RETAILERS AS? YOU MUCH A FUNCTION OF LOCAL COMMUNITIES -- BOTH IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW WHO THIS AND WHO -- WHO PEOPLE COMPLAIN ABOUT SO IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE REALLY HAVEN'T LOOKED AT CLOSELY OURSELVES -- BECAUSE MOSTLY WERE RESPONDING TO LOCAL ISSUES -- BE THE A YOU KNOW FROM ALL MEMBERS BRING THEM FOREVER YOU HAVE NO OVERSIGHT ON DISTRIBUTION OR MANUFACTURING AND LOOK AT THAT WE DO BUT WE DON'T HAVE ANY ANY AUTHORITY OR ANALYSIS OF WHO'S OWNING THOSE BUSINESSES OTHER THAN WHETHER THEY'RE QUALIFIED. THANK YOU MY LAST QUESTION. IT IS -- HOME DELIVERY I BAD DON'T TOTALLY UNDERSTAND THAT PARTS OF THE COUNTRY. PEOPLE ARE DELIVERING GROCERIES AND AND THINGS YOU KNOW YOU SEE NEW YORK CHICAGO AND AND AND CALIFORNIA'S START TO PICK UP. OUR WE REGULATE IN THAT THAT WE DON'T -- DELIVER TO MINORS -- AT THE HOME. SO WE WE DON'T HAVE ANY THERE'S NO LAWS OR REGULATIONS THAT PERTAIN TO IT IN PARTICULAR BUT WHAT THE WAY WE TREATED IS THAT THE RETAILERS RESPONSIBLE FOR IT FROM THE MOMENT IT LEAVES ITS DOOR. TO THE MOMENT TO IT THE PURCHASE A CURSE SO IF THEY USE THEIR OWN DELIVERY DRIVERS. BUT THEY'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR WITH THE US SALE TO A MINOR IF THEY HANDED OVER. TO TO DRIZZLY OR SOME OTHER THIRD PARTY COMPANY. AND THERE'S A SALE TO A MINOR BY SOMEONE THEY DON'T EMPLOY. THE RETAILERS DON'T STILL RESPONSIBLE FOR I DON'T KNOW BUT IT'S REDUCE THE MODEL WE USE BECAUSE IT'S REALLY REALLY WE HOLD THEM RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SALE. BUT AGAIN WE REALLY HAD NO. ISSUES. THE INDUSTRY THUS FAR ISN'T AS FAR AS WE KNOW HAS BEEN RESPONSIBLE -- AS YOU KNOW I'M CURRENTLY WORKING ON LEGISLATION WILL PROVIDE ADDITIONAL -- LICENSES -- FOR RESTAURANTS. HERE -- I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THE PERHAPS MAYBE YOU ADDRESS THE BOTH THE POPULAR THE POPULATION LIMITS FOR OFF SALE AND ON SALE. YES SO KIND OF THE HIT AROUND WAS A DIFFERENT SURE SO SO WITH SO WITH RESTAURANTS ANYONE -- THERE'S NO. THERE'S WITH RESTAURANTS THAT WANT TO SELL HARD DISTILLED SPIRITS -- THERE'S A LIMIT BY -- BY COUNTY TO ONE PER TWO THOUSAND RESIDENTS -- AND NOW IT'S JUST STRAIGHT UP IN STATUTES -- INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH IN NINETEEN SIXTY ONE AND ONE FROM ONE THOUSAND TO TWO THOUSAND AND THAT WAS LARGELY BECAUSE OF THE BABY BOOM AND THE CONCERN THAT THERE WAS GOING TO BE JUST ON A RUSH OF LICENSES CREATED. AT THAT TIME -- SO IT'S RENTS THEMSELVES MOST OF THE CONCERNS PEOPLE HAVE WITH -- WITH THAT WELL CALL STEPS IN SCHOOL ABOUT ARE NOT RESTAURANTS THEIR NIGHTCLUBS. SO IN IN THE RESTAURANT INDUSTRY HAS CHANGED SO MUCH PEOPLE JUST PLAIN EAT OUT MORE THEY SPEND MORE ON THERE'S JUST MUCH MORE DEMANDS FOR RESTAURANTS AND THERE USED TO BE. SO WHETHER THE TWO THOUSAND LIMóN IS REALLY THE RIGHT WAY TO LOOK AT ANYMORE IS A GOOD QUESTION -- THERE ARE SOME AREAS LIKE YOURS AND CENTER WINNERS -- AND CENTER BRADFORD'S WHERE LICENSES MIGHT BE GOING FOR THE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS ON THE OPEN MARKET WHEREAS IF YOU COME TO US FOR A LICENSE IT'S FIFTEEN THOUSAND OKAY LOOKS LIKE IT'S THAT TIME DIRECTOR THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATE. YOU BEING HERE THIS MORNING AND YOUR GREAT STAFF -- WHOSE GREAT WORK -- FOR ALL OUR CONSTITUENTS APPRECIATE -- YOU BEING HERE. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY AND ANY TIME ANY OF YOU WANT INFORMATION PLEASE CONTACT US WE WE REALLY LIKE TO GET OUT IN FRONT OF ISSUES -- AND WORK OF ALL OF YOU SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF THE TIME
