CBO SEES THE CITIES AS WELL AS

01:03:28.971 --> 01:03:34.810
THE COUNTIES- ALSO. THE- THERE

01:03:34.877 --> 01:03:37.446
IS THERE IS A CAP SO THAT NO

01:03:37.513 --> 01:03:39.248
ONE ENTITY CAN GET MORE THAN

01:03:39.315 --> 01:03:40.816
FORTY FIVE PERCENT. OKAY SAID

01:03:40.883 --> 01:03:42.451
THIS SAID THAT THE ALLOCATION

01:03:42.518 --> 01:03:44.153
OF FUNDS WILL BE A PERCENT IS

01:03:44.220 --> 01:03:46.689
BASED ON POPULATION GROWTH- OF-

01:03:46.756 --> 01:03:48.591
THE HOMELESS POPULATION- BUT

01:03:48.658 --> 01:03:50.693
THAT HOMELESS POPULATION IS THE

01:03:50.760 --> 01:03:51.527
TWENTY NINETEEN CORRECT TOTAL

01:03:51.594 --> 01:03:54.363
POPULATION THAT'S OKAY. THANK

01:03:54.430 --> 01:03:56.766
YOU MISTER CHAIR. UP YEAH IT TO

01:03:56.832 --> 01:04:03.039
THE RESOURCES- BILL- WENT. ONE

01:04:03.105 --> 01:04:04.540
FORTY EIGHT- WITH THE END I

01:04:04.607 --> 01:04:06.709
GUESS THERE'S A AN INCREASE IN

01:04:06.776 --> 01:04:09.378
THE IN THE FEE OF PER BARREL O

01:04:09.445 --> 01:04:12.248
OIL- FROM SIXTY FIVE CENTS

01:04:12.315 --> 01:04:13.983
EIGHTY FIVE CENTS- WHERE DID

01:04:14.050 --> 01:04:17.019
THOSE PROCEEDS GO AND- WHAT

01:04:17.086 --> 01:04:17.987
DOES THAT MEAN TO THE AVERAGE

01:04:18.054 --> 01:04:20.423
CONSUMER- IS THERE CONCERN OF

01:04:20.489 --> 01:04:23.793
THE- THE OF THE IMPACT ON THE

01:04:23.859 --> 01:04:29.365
PRICE PER GALLON OF GASOLINE.

01:04:29.432 --> 01:04:30.199
YEAH THANK YOU FOR THAT

01:04:30.266 --> 01:04:31.867
QUESTION- I WILL TURN IT OVER

01:04:31.934 --> 01:04:33.769
TO. OUR SPECIFIC TO MY

01:04:33.836 --> 01:04:35.504
COLLEAGUES BUT I BELIEVE THE

01:04:35.571 --> 01:04:38.274
INCREASE IS A PER BARREL FEE

01:04:38.341 --> 01:04:40.076
FROM SIX POINT FIVE CENTS TO

01:04:40.142 --> 01:04:42.011
EIGHT POINT 5% I'M SORRY THAT I

01:04:42.078 --> 01:04:44.680
READ THAT WRONG SIX POINTFIVE

01:04:44.747 --> 01:04:45.214
CENTS. TO EIGHT POINT FIVE

01:04:45.281 --> 01:04:48.017
CENTS. YES DRIVE OVER THE

01:04:48.084 --> 01:04:50.553
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- SO THE

01:04:50.620 --> 01:04:51.687
FEE INCREASE IS INTENDED TO

01:04:51.754 --> 01:04:53.589
ADDRESS A STRUCTURAL DEFICIT

01:04:53.656 --> 01:04:55.057
AND THE BALLOT FUND. WHICH

01:04:55.124 --> 01:04:57.360
SUPPORTS- DIFFERENT- CAN

01:04:57.426 --> 01:04:59.161
REGULARS GOOD ACTIVITIES FOR

01:04:59.228 --> 01:05:00.496
THE OFFICE OF OIL SPILL

01:05:00.563 --> 01:05:03.532
PREVENTION AND RESPONSE- AND

01:05:03.599 --> 01:05:04.900
SO. AS PART OF LAST YEAR.

01:05:04.967 --> 01:05:07.703
PROVIDE A LOAN TO THE FUNDED

01:05:07.770 --> 01:05:09.005
GIVEN THE STRUCTURAL DEFICIT.

01:05:09.071 --> 01:05:10.706
BUT THIS- FEE INCREASE WOULD

01:05:10.773 --> 01:05:11.774
ADDRESS THAT **** UP WITH IT

01:05:11.841 --> 01:05:13.242
WHICH BASICALLY JUST MAINTAINS

01:05:13.309 --> 01:05:14.710
THEIR THEIR CURRENT EXPENDITURE

01:05:14.777 --> 01:05:18.180
LEVEL- WE DID DO HAVE ECONOMIC.

01:05:18.247 --> 01:05:20.616
IMPACT REVIEW TO SEE WHAT

01:05:20.683 --> 01:05:21.717
POTENTIAL IMPACT THAT WOULD

01:05:21.784 --> 01:05:25.321
HAVE ON- THE CONSUMER AND SO

01:05:25.388 --> 01:05:27.423
THE TWO PURPOSE AND INCREASE

01:05:27.490 --> 01:05:28.724
AND FEDERAL WOULD RESULT IN

01:05:28.791 --> 01:05:33.162
APPROXIMATELY 4% OF A PENNY. AT

01:05:33.229 --> 01:05:36.065
THE GALLON AT THE PUMP. 4% OF

01:05:36.132 --> 01:05:40.970
THE VALUE OKAY- I GUESS THE

01:05:41.037 --> 01:05:42.171
QUESTION WOULD BE IF THERE'S A

01:05:42.238 --> 01:05:43.472
STRUCTURAL DEFICIT AND THERE

01:05:43.539 --> 01:05:44.807
ARE OTHER STRUCTURAL DEFICITS

01:05:44.874 --> 01:05:45.741
IN A LOT OF ACCOUNTS THROUGHOUT

01:05:45.808 --> 01:05:48.844
THE BUDGET WHY NOT WITH THE

01:05:48.911 --> 01:05:52.548
SURPLUS- USE THE AT THE ADDED

01:05:52.615 --> 01:05:53.983
RESOURCES THAT CAME TO THE

01:05:54.050 --> 01:06:00.489
STATE PURSES OF A FEE INCREASE.

01:06:00.556 --> 01:06:02.925
THIS IS A DEBATE FUND THAT YOU

01:06:02.992 --> 01:06:05.161
KNOW PER STATUE. THAT THE

01:06:05.227 --> 01:06:06.462
REVENUE SOURCE THAT FUND THESE

01:06:06.529 --> 01:06:08.931
ACTIVITIES FOR- THE AUTHOR THE

01:06:08.998 --> 01:06:10.499
WORLD PROFESSIONAL RESPONSE SO

01:06:10.566 --> 01:06:12.568
WE THINK IT IS APPROPRIATE TO

01:06:12.635 --> 01:06:15.037
CONTINUE FUNDING THE STATUTORY

01:06:15.104 --> 01:06:17.673
MANDATED WORK OF THAT OFFICE-

01:06:17.740 --> 01:06:20.109
WITH THEIR DESIGNATED- FUND FOR

01:06:20.176 --> 01:06:23.212
EVERY. SO LET ME CHALLENGE YOU

01:06:23.279 --> 01:06:23.779
THEIR LITTLE BIT THERE OTHER

01:06:23.846 --> 01:06:27.316
FEE BASED FUNDS- I THINK- BUT A

01:06:27.383 --> 01:06:28.684
VEHICLE FUND IS A FEE BASED

01:06:28.751 --> 01:06:30.653
FUND BUT- BUT YOU'RE NOT

01:06:30.720 --> 01:06:32.488
RAISING THOSE FEES. FOR THEIR

01:06:32.555 --> 01:06:34.890
STRUCTURE WITH THEIR SON

01:06:34.957 --> 01:06:41.297
SOLVENCY ISSUES. MR FONG THANK

01:06:41.364 --> 01:06:42.598
YOU FOR THAT POINT I THINK IT

01:06:42.665 --> 01:06:45.101
GENERALLY- BUT WHEN THERE ARE

01:06:45.167 --> 01:06:47.036
ISSUES WITH PARTICULAR FUNDS WE

01:06:47.103 --> 01:06:49.205
TRY TO WORK WITH THEM. IN

01:06:49.271 --> 01:06:51.073
REGARDS TO WIN THEY MAY BECOME

01:06:51.140 --> 01:06:52.608
INSOLVENT AND THIS IS ONE OF

01:06:52.675 --> 01:06:55.678
THOSE FUNDS THAT- WE'D- YOU

01:06:55.745 --> 01:06:57.213
KNOW IT'S TAKEN UP THIS YEAR-

01:06:57.279 --> 01:06:59.248
YOU HAVE A BROADER. QUESTION I

01:06:59.315 --> 01:07:00.916
THINK THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE

01:07:00.983 --> 01:07:02.785
LOOK AT EVERY YEAR AT VARIOUS

01:07:02.852 --> 01:07:06.622
OF FINES. AND FEES. MIGHT BE

01:07:06.689 --> 01:07:08.858
NECESSARY TO BE RAISED- AND

01:07:08.924 --> 01:07:10.459
YOUR POINT ABOUT THE DMV IS

01:07:10.526 --> 01:07:11.994
SOMETHING THAT YOU WE'VE LOOKED

01:07:12.061 --> 01:07:14.864
INTO THAT THE STATUS OF THAT

01:07:14.930 --> 01:07:16.599
FIND. ANNUALLY THE CIVICALLY

01:07:16.665 --> 01:07:19.402
BECAUSE THAT IS- ONE THAT MANY

01:07:19.468 --> 01:07:20.736
PEOPLE THINK IT TOO AND SO I

01:07:20.803 --> 01:07:21.837
THINK YOUR QUESTION IS MY PRIDE

01:07:21.904 --> 01:07:23.172
AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE LOOK

01:07:23.239 --> 01:07:24.240
AT ACROSS ALL SPECIAL FUNDS.

01:07:24.306 --> 01:07:27.610
OKAY I MEAN I GUESS THAT'S NOT

01:07:27.676 --> 01:07:28.144
MY POINT IS THAT THIS IS A

01:07:28.210 --> 01:07:29.979
CHOICE. EVEN BE MADE A POLICY

01:07:30.045 --> 01:07:32.114
DECISION AND- YOU WANT TO

01:07:32.181 --> 01:07:33.916
INCREASE THE STREET- EVEN

01:07:33.983 --> 01:07:35.117
THOUGH I THINK THAT THERE'S

01:07:35.184 --> 01:07:36.619
PROBABLY ANOTHER ALTERNATIVE.

01:07:36.685 --> 01:07:39.655
AND BUT THE IMPACT IT WILL BE

01:07:39.722 --> 01:07:40.623
TOO THERE WILL BE AN IMPACT OF

01:07:40.689 --> 01:07:41.857
THE CONSUMER I KNOW I'M NOT

01:07:41.924 --> 01:07:43.692
SURE THE 4% OF A PENNY IS

01:07:43.759 --> 01:07:46.429
COMPLETELY ACCURATE. BUT- I

01:07:46.495 --> 01:07:48.197
WILL SAY THAT. TO ROUTE RAISE A

01:07:48.264 --> 01:07:50.065
FEE FROM SIX POINT FIVE CENTS A

01:07:50.132 --> 01:07:51.934
POINT FIVE CENTS PER BARREL-

01:07:52.001 --> 01:07:53.202
WILL HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE

01:07:53.269 --> 01:07:54.003
PRICE OF GASOLINE IN THE PRICE

01:07:54.069 --> 01:07:56.372
OF ENERGY IN GENERAL. AND I

01:07:56.439 --> 01:07:58.441
THINK THAT WITH. THE THAT

01:07:58.507 --> 01:08:00.009
NGUYEN FATHER SURPLUS I WANTED

01:08:00.075 --> 01:08:01.510
TO FIND OUT THAT WE HAVE NOW.

01:08:01.577 --> 01:08:03.078
IF IT IS AS IMMEDIATE AS YOU

01:08:03.145 --> 01:08:04.780
SAY IT IS. I THINK THAT YOU

01:08:04.847 --> 01:08:06.148
COULD PROBABLY BACK FILL IT

01:08:06.215 --> 01:08:09.318
WITH WITH THE S. P. ADDED

01:08:09.385 --> 01:08:12.221
SURPLUS- IN TERMS OF. IF YOU

01:08:12.288 --> 01:08:13.322
LOOK INTO THE BRING THE BILL I

01:08:13.389 --> 01:08:14.623
BELIEVE THERE'S- SEVERAL

01:08:14.690 --> 01:08:15.591
EXEMPTIONS FROM THE

01:08:15.658 --> 01:08:18.394
ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES ACT-

01:08:18.461 --> 01:08:19.028
FOR PROGRAMS FUNDED THROUGH THE

01:08:19.094 --> 01:08:22.364
AIR RESOURCES BOARD-

01:08:22.431 --> 01:08:24.567
EXEMPTIONS- THAT COVER-

01:08:24.633 --> 01:08:26.202
ALTERNATIVES AG BURNING IN THE

01:08:26.268 --> 01:08:27.636
SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY AND THE

01:08:27.703 --> 01:08:29.205
SEVEN CENTER PROGRAMS. THERE

01:08:29.271 --> 01:08:31.207
HAVE BEEN. A NUMBER OF AUDITS-

01:08:31.273 --> 01:08:33.742
LED BY- OUR OUR FORMER A

01:08:33.809 --> 01:08:36.512
TRANSPORTATION CHAIR- CONCERNED

01:08:36.579 --> 01:08:38.314
ABOUT THE ACTIVITIES OF THEIR

01:08:38.380 --> 01:08:40.816
RESOURCES BOARD- AND THESE

01:08:40.883 --> 01:08:43.285
EXEMPTIONS PREVENT PUBLIC INPUT

01:08:43.352 --> 01:08:45.855
AND PARTICIPATION SO. HOW DID.

01:08:45.921 --> 01:08:47.623
HOW DID THESE EXEMPTIONS COME

01:08:47.690 --> 01:08:50.092
INTO PLAY WHO WAS CONSULTED AND

01:08:50.159 --> 01:08:50.659
WHAT'S THE JUSTIFICATION FOR

01:08:50.726 --> 01:08:56.298
THEM. YES AGAIN SIR DO I GOT

01:08:56.365 --> 01:08:58.334
WITH THE PART OF FINANCE AND SO

01:08:58.400 --> 01:09:00.302
CURRENTLY THE DIFFERENCE THERE

01:09:00.369 --> 01:09:01.737
ARE PROGRAMS THAT ARE PART OF

01:09:01.804 --> 01:09:03.539
THE EXEMPTION THEY THEY ALREADY

01:09:03.606 --> 01:09:06.041
DO HAVE B. A. P. EXEMPTION-

01:09:06.108 --> 01:09:07.109
WHEN THEY'RE FUNDED OUT OF CAP

01:09:07.176 --> 01:09:09.245
AND TRADE. AFTER THE THOSE KIND

01:09:09.311 --> 01:09:10.412
OF CONTINUATION OF THAT BUT

01:09:10.479 --> 01:09:12.481
GIVEN THAT WE FUNDED THE

01:09:12.548 --> 01:09:14.717
PROGRAMS WITH A MIX OF CAP AND

01:09:14.783 --> 01:09:16.819
TRADE AND GENERAL FUND. I WENT

01:09:16.886 --> 01:09:17.786
TO CUENTA THEIR GENERAL FUND

01:09:17.853 --> 01:09:19.355
AND THAT SAME EXEMPTION DOES

01:09:19.421 --> 01:09:21.524
NOT EXTEND ABSOLUTE MERELY JUST

01:09:21.590 --> 01:09:23.192
IT IS A REFLECTION OF. THE FUN

01:09:23.259 --> 01:09:25.261
SORT OF CHANGE THAT WE WANT THE

01:09:25.327 --> 01:09:26.629
PROGRAM TO HAVE THE SAME

01:09:26.695 --> 01:09:28.964
EXEMPTION IT CURRENTLY HAS- AND

01:09:29.031 --> 01:09:30.933
SO- IT REALLY JUST IS MORE OF A

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.502
TECHNICAL BASED OFF OF THE FUND

01:09:33.569 --> 01:09:38.841
THAT- IS- FUNDING. THE PROGRAM

01:09:38.908 --> 01:09:39.542
THIS YEAR. OKAY I WOULD SAY

01:09:39.608 --> 01:09:40.376
THOUGH THAT IF YOU GONNA ON

01:09:40.442 --> 01:09:42.144
ONCE. YOU ERR ON THE SIDE.

01:09:42.211 --> 01:09:44.613
TOWARDTRANSPARENCY NOT AWAY

01:09:44.680 --> 01:09:46.615
FROM IT. WOULDN'T YOU AGREE. OR

01:09:46.682 --> 01:09:47.750
HAS THE OFFICE ADMINISTRATIVE

01:09:47.816 --> 01:09:49.585
LAW HAVE THEY BEEN CONSULTED

01:09:49.652 --> 01:09:54.857
WITH THIS DECISION. I THINK

01:09:54.924 --> 01:09:55.824
WHAT I WOULD HIGHLIGHT IS

01:09:55.891 --> 01:09:57.293
ESPECIALLY ON THE THEY ARE BE

01:09:57.359 --> 01:09:59.028
PROGRAM THEY DO HAVE YOU KNOW-

01:09:59.094 --> 01:10:00.763
PUBLIC PROCESS THE THROUGH THE

01:10:00.829 --> 01:10:03.032
BOARD IS JUST NOT THAT SAME.

01:10:03.098 --> 01:10:05.568
APA- PROCESS. BUT AGAIN JUST

01:10:05.634 --> 01:10:06.535
GIVEN THAT THE PROGRAMS

01:10:06.602 --> 01:10:08.170
CURRENTLY ALREADY DO HAVE. THE

01:10:08.237 --> 01:10:09.772
áP EXEMPTION THEY'RE JUST

01:10:09.838 --> 01:10:11.740
ALLOW THEM TO CONTINUE AND THEN

01:10:11.807 --> 01:10:13.309
GET THE FUNDING OUT QUICKER

01:10:13.375 --> 01:10:14.577
RATHER THAN HAVING TO RESTART

01:10:14.643 --> 01:10:16.278
THE PROGRAM. I WHICH AGAIN

01:10:16.345 --> 01:10:18.247
CURRENTLY ALREADY HAVE THE AB

01:10:18.314 --> 01:10:20.749
EXACT OKAY. WELL I WOULD SAY AS

01:10:20.816 --> 01:10:23.252
AS AS SOMEONE WHO SAT ON THE

01:10:23.319 --> 01:10:23.819
COMMITTEE THAT REVIEWED THE

01:10:23.886 --> 01:10:26.922
AUDIT. INCLUSIONS I THINK THAT

01:10:26.989 --> 01:10:28.824
THAT THERE IS SEVERE CHALLENGES

01:10:28.891 --> 01:10:32.194
WITH IN CAR. WHEN IT COMES TO-

01:10:32.261 --> 01:10:35.197
THEIR ABILITY OR CAPACITY TO

01:10:35.264 --> 01:10:36.165
OVERSEE THESE PROJECTS AND I

01:10:36.231 --> 01:10:38.067
THINK MORE TRANSPARENCY IS

01:10:38.133 --> 01:10:40.269
PROBABLY NECESSARY- TO MAKE

01:10:40.336 --> 01:10:41.604
SURE THAT THESE FUNDS ARE BEING

01:10:41.670 --> 01:10:43.739
USED PROPERLY- AND I AM

01:10:43.806 --> 01:10:45.874
CONCERNED THAT. EXPANDING THESE

01:10:45.941 --> 01:10:47.876
EXEMPTIONS ACTUALLY MOVES US IN

01:10:47.943 --> 01:10:49.878
THE WRONG DIRECTION- INTIMATE

01:10:49.945 --> 01:10:51.113
AND THAT MAY BE SOMETHING THAT-

01:10:51.180 --> 01:10:52.448
WE NEED TO HAVE A BROADER

01:10:52.514 --> 01:10:54.516
COMMITTEE- CONVERSATION ABOUT-

01:10:54.583 --> 01:10:56.619
BUT THAT THINGS ITS IT'S-

01:10:56.685 --> 01:10:57.820
SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE TO BE

01:10:57.886 --> 01:10:59.722
COGNIZANT OF- AND I'M- I'M

01:10:59.788 --> 01:11:03.325
DEEPLY CONCERNED ABOUT THAT-

01:11:03.392 --> 01:11:08.731
JUMPING TO YOU- TO BROADBAND-

01:11:08.797 --> 01:11:10.599
WHY IS THE SEQUEL EXEMPTION

01:11:10.666 --> 01:11:12.635
LIMITED TO THE MIDDLE MILE WHY

01:11:12.701 --> 01:11:14.603
NOT APPLY IT TO THE MIDDLE MILE

01:11:14.670 --> 01:11:20.109
AND LAST MILE. HI MISTER BY

01:11:20.175 --> 01:11:21.777
WILL TURN THAT QUESTION OVER TO

01:11:21.844 --> 01:11:25.748
MY COLLEAGUE. NUMBER ONE- TO

01:11:25.814 --> 01:11:28.550
PARTLY FINANCE. WHEN WE TALK

01:11:28.617 --> 01:11:29.918
ABOUT THE SEQUENCE ACTIONS

01:11:29.985 --> 01:11:32.087
IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT IT'S

01:11:32.154 --> 01:11:33.389
REALLY MORE OF A STREAMLINING

01:11:33.455 --> 01:11:36.925
RIGHT AND SO- YOU CAN IMAGINE

01:11:36.992 --> 01:11:39.128
THAT- ON WHAT WE'RE TALKING

01:11:39.194 --> 01:11:41.563
ABOUT USING. LAND ALONG STATE

01:11:41.630 --> 01:11:43.232
HIGHWAYS SO THERE'S ALREADY IN

01:11:43.298 --> 01:11:44.533
YOUR ROBUST ENVIRONMENTAL

01:11:44.600 --> 01:11:46.769
PROCESS THAT HAS BEEN FOLLOWED-

01:11:46.835 --> 01:11:47.770
TO PUT THE ROAD THERE IN THE

01:11:47.836 --> 01:11:48.804
FIRST PLACE IS A LOT OF

01:11:48.871 --> 01:11:50.205
INFORMATION WHERE BEHALF SO

01:11:50.272 --> 01:11:52.875
REALLY. IT'S NOT- AND BECOME A

01:11:52.941 --> 01:11:55.110
CONDUIT AND ALREADY EXEMPTION-

01:11:55.177 --> 01:11:57.212
BUT IT'S REALLY JUST TRYING TO

01:11:57.279 --> 01:11:59.815
CAPITALIZE ON. THE WORK THAT

01:11:59.882 --> 01:12:03.218
THE CALTRANS IS ALREADY DONE-

01:12:03.285 --> 01:12:05.988
AND- IT IS TO SPEED THE PROJECT

01:12:06.055 --> 01:12:09.191
ALONG- IT WOULD BE MUCH MORE

01:12:09.258 --> 01:12:10.559
EXPENSIVE AND WE CAN'T REALLY

01:12:10.626 --> 01:12:12.294
SPEAK TO WEAR IN TERMS OF THE

01:12:12.361 --> 01:12:14.430
LAST MILE WHERE THAT WOULD GO-

01:12:14.496 --> 01:12:15.564
THEN THAT'S THAT'S REALLY UP TO

01:12:15.631 --> 01:12:16.765
THE PROVIDERS TO KIND OF

01:12:16.832 --> 01:12:18.400
CONTROL THAT SO. WE JUST MADE

01:12:18.467 --> 01:12:20.936
IT TO THE MIDDLE MILE OKAY WELL

01:12:21.003 --> 01:12:22.104
LET ME USE YOUR LANGUAGE THEN

01:12:22.171 --> 01:12:23.806
SO LET'S SAY IT'S EQUESTRIAN

01:12:23.872 --> 01:12:25.340
RIDING RIGHT I WOULD SAY THAT

01:12:25.407 --> 01:12:27.009
IF WE'RE GOING TO MAKE OUR

01:12:27.076 --> 01:12:28.777
DOLLAR GO FURTHER. IT WOULD

01:12:28.844 --> 01:12:30.212
MAKE SENSE TO APPLY IT TO THE

01:12:30.279 --> 01:12:33.148
MIDDLE MILE AND LAST MILE

01:12:33.215 --> 01:12:37.019
WOULDN'T YOU AGREE. TO THE

01:12:37.086 --> 01:12:42.424
EXTENT THAT. I THINK WE CAN

01:12:42.491 --> 01:12:45.861
ONLY SPEAK TO THE- TO THE

01:12:45.928 --> 01:12:47.896
SEQUEL PROCESSES THAT CALTRANS

01:12:47.963 --> 01:12:49.364
ALREADY FOLLOW THE BODY FOUND

01:12:49.431 --> 01:12:51.934
ON THE STATE HIGHWAY SYSTEM-

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:55.604
AND WE- THERE'S NOT WE DON'T

01:12:55.671 --> 01:12:56.105
HAVE THAT SAME LEVEL OF

01:12:56.171 --> 01:12:58.907
INFORMATION FOR. WHAT'S THE I

01:12:58.974 --> 01:13:00.676
WOULD SECTOR WOULD BE DOING IN

01:13:00.743 --> 01:13:02.344
TERMS OF PROVIDERS YEAH WE'RE

01:13:02.411 --> 01:13:03.412
GONNA GO TO THE BUDGET

01:13:03.479 --> 01:13:04.379
COMMITTEE AS WELL- ANSWER

01:13:04.446 --> 01:13:05.748
MISTER CHAIR THIS SECTION OF

01:13:05.814 --> 01:13:07.049
THE ASSEMBLY BUDGET COMMITTEE

01:13:07.116 --> 01:13:09.251
ON THIS PARTICULAR- SEQUEL

01:13:09.318 --> 01:13:10.552
EXEMPTION- IT PLUS THE RIGHT OF

01:13:10.619 --> 01:13:12.488
WAYS AND IT CAN ACTUALLY IS A

01:13:12.554 --> 01:13:14.523
ELIGIBLE FOR THE MIDDLE MILE OR

01:13:14.590 --> 01:13:16.291
FOR NONPROFIT OR EVEN A FOR

01:13:16.358 --> 01:13:17.359
PROFIT PROVIDERS LONG AS IT'S

01:13:17.426 --> 01:13:18.794
ALONG THE RIGHT AWAY TO THE

01:13:18.861 --> 01:13:20.529
EXEMPTIONS REALLY ABOUT WHERE

01:13:20.596 --> 01:13:23.198
THE WHERE THE LINE IS LAID NOT

01:13:23.265 --> 01:13:24.233
WHETHER IT'S MIDDLE MILE THE

01:13:24.299 --> 01:13:25.567
LAST MILE IT'S JUST WHETHER

01:13:25.634 --> 01:13:26.668
YOU'RE USING THIS RIGHT AWAY

01:13:26.735 --> 01:13:29.938
FOR THAT OKAY SO ANY. SO ANY.

01:13:30.005 --> 01:13:32.574
ANY PROJECT THAT IS ON EXISTING

01:13:32.641 --> 01:13:33.675
RIGHT AWAY IT WOULD BE ELIGIBLE

01:13:33.742 --> 01:13:37.479
FOR THIS. THE LIMITED- GROUP OF

01:13:37.546 --> 01:13:39.214
THE GIFT RIGHT OF WAYS BUT YES

01:13:39.281 --> 01:13:40.249
IF IT IF IT IS THE RIGHT AWAY

01:13:40.315 --> 01:13:41.750
IT DOESN'T MATTER IF IT MENTAL

01:13:41.817 --> 01:13:42.384
MINE A LOT OF MILEAGE HAVE TO

01:13:42.451 --> 01:13:44.887
BE USED OKAY. I SEE I SEE YOUR

01:13:44.953 --> 01:13:47.122
POINT I THINK FOR THOSE OF US

01:13:47.189 --> 01:13:49.024
IN IT WHO HAVE WHO HAVE

01:13:49.091 --> 01:13:52.361
EXPERIENCED A SEQUEL- FOR A LOT

01:13:52.427 --> 01:13:53.362
OF PROJECTS WHETHER IT'S ROADS

01:13:53.428 --> 01:13:54.930
OR ANYTHING ELSE IT TENDS TO BE

01:13:54.997 --> 01:13:56.031
CUMBERSOME IT TENDS TO BE VERY

01:13:56.098 --> 01:13:57.065
LINK THEY TEND TO BE LOOKS POOR

01:13:57.132 --> 01:13:58.767
EXPENSIVE SO. IF WE CAN RUN

01:13:58.834 --> 01:14:00.102
THAT OUT I THINK THAT THAT'S

01:14:00.169 --> 01:14:02.304
SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO- TOOK

01:14:02.371 --> 01:14:05.607
TO LOOK AT- AS WELL- I GUESS

01:14:05.674 --> 01:14:06.375
IT'S BACK TO THEBOMBING OF

01:14:06.442 --> 01:14:08.010
FINANCE JUMPING TO JUST METRICS

01:14:08.076 --> 01:14:10.279
AGAIN- A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF

01:14:10.345 --> 01:14:12.447
MONEY IS BEING. INVESTED I WANT

01:14:12.514 --> 01:14:14.750
TO SAY IT'S ABOUT FOUR POINT

01:14:14.817 --> 01:14:17.352
FIVE BILLION DOLLARS- SO HOW DO

01:14:17.419 --> 01:14:19.121
YOU DEFINE SUCCESS IS IT THE

01:14:19.188 --> 01:14:20.622
AMOUNT OF CONNECTIONS IT'S IS

01:14:20.689 --> 01:14:22.391
THAT THE AMOUNT OF COMMUNITIES

01:14:22.457 --> 01:14:23.492
THAT ARE BEING GET CONNECTED TO

01:14:23.559 --> 01:14:28.163
BROADBAND- APPLE. HOW DO WE

01:14:28.230 --> 01:14:29.164
KNOW WHAT. WHAT IS IN EUROPEAN.

01:14:29.231 --> 01:14:30.165
OVER THE MISSISSIPPI WHAT IS

01:14:30.232 --> 01:14:37.372
SUCCESS. WE HAVE. THE INITIAL

01:14:37.439 --> 01:14:39.808
MEASURE THAT WE HAD USED FOR OR

01:14:39.875 --> 01:14:42.578
THE- SIX HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE

01:14:42.644 --> 01:14:43.178
THOUSAND A MONTH- COUNCILS OF

01:14:43.245 --> 01:14:45.514
THE STATE- AND THOSE ARE

01:14:45.581 --> 01:14:48.350
HOUSEHOLDS BUT PHYSICALLY DON'T

01:14:48.417 --> 01:14:50.686
HAVE. ACCESS TO BROADBAND

01:14:50.752 --> 01:14:52.387
SERVICE I'M SO CERTAINLY THE

01:14:52.454 --> 01:14:54.423
NUMBER OF HOUSEHOLDS SERVED-

01:14:54.489 --> 01:14:56.358
COME INTO PLAY COMMUNITY

01:14:56.425 --> 01:14:58.660
SERVICE. COME INTO PLAY- THERE

01:14:58.727 --> 01:14:59.995
ARE YOU KNOW LIKE A NUMBER FOR

01:15:00.062 --> 01:15:01.730
THE COMMUNITIES IN THE STATE

01:15:01.797 --> 01:15:06.335
THAT. THIS MONTH SAYS DON'T

01:15:06.401 --> 01:15:07.269
HAVE ACCESS AND SO. SHOULD BE

01:15:07.336 --> 01:15:08.503
REACHING OUT AND HAVING BROKER

01:15:08.570 --> 01:15:09.838
BE ABLE TO GET TO ALL OF THE

01:15:09.905 --> 01:15:12.307
COMMUNITIES. REGARDLESS OF

01:15:12.374 --> 01:15:13.575
WHERE THEY ARE WOULD BE ANOTHER

01:15:13.642 --> 01:15:16.879
MEASURE. SO THE SIX SEVEN SEVEN

01:15:16.945 --> 01:15:17.479
FIVE THOUSAND UNSERVED THAT'S

01:15:17.546 --> 01:15:19.414
THE OTAL AMOUNT OF UNSERVED-

01:15:19.481 --> 01:15:22.417
HOUSEHOLDS IN CALIFORNIA. THE

01:15:22.484 --> 01:15:22.985
AND- THAT YOU HAVE THAT YOUR

01:15:23.051 --> 01:15:27.222
ACCOUNT. THAT IS WHAT. THE

01:15:27.289 --> 01:15:28.957
INDUSTRY HAS REPORTED TO THE

01:15:29.024 --> 01:15:30.726
PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION. IN

01:15:30.792 --> 01:15:33.161
TERMS OF WHERE. THEY ARE UNABLE

01:15:33.228 --> 01:15:35.230
TO PROVIDE SERVICE. SO AND

01:15:35.297 --> 01:15:36.598
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE WILL

01:15:36.665 --> 01:15:37.866
CONTINUE TO- THAT THE PUBLIC

01:15:37.933 --> 01:15:39.401
UTILITIES COMMISSION WILL

01:15:39.468 --> 01:15:41.270
CONTINUE TO REVISIT MARC ON.

01:15:41.336 --> 01:15:42.137
OKAY WELL I THINK IT'S

01:15:42.204 --> 01:15:44.873
IMPORTANT AS THE LEGISLATURE TO

01:15:44.940 --> 01:15:46.875
UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT NUMBER IS.

01:15:46.942 --> 01:15:50.212
SO IF THE NUMBER IS SIX ARE

01:15:50.279 --> 01:15:51.146
SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND UNSERVED.

01:15:51.213 --> 01:15:53.382
HOUSEHOLDS THE NEXT YEAR WHEN

01:15:53.448 --> 01:15:54.917
WE HAVE THIS DISCUSSION OF HOW

01:15:54.983 --> 01:15:56.785
THE MONEY IS BEING USED. I

01:15:56.852 --> 01:15:57.686
WOULD PRESUME THAT WE WOULD

01:15:57.753 --> 01:16:00.289
HAVE LESS OR WHATEVER THAT

01:16:00.355 --> 01:16:00.789
NUMBER IS SO THAT WE CAN

01:16:00.856 --> 01:16:04.726
ACTUALLY MEASURE. SUCCESS WHO

01:16:04.793 --> 01:16:06.828
IS THAT IS THAT BUILT INTO THE-

01:16:06.895 --> 01:16:09.564
INTO THE INTO THE PROJECT OR

01:16:09.631 --> 01:16:12.267
INTO THE FUNDING. HI MR YES IT

01:16:12.334 --> 01:16:13.702
IS YES THERE ARE THERE'S A

01:16:13.769 --> 01:16:16.038
REPORTING MEASURES IN THE BILL

01:16:16.104 --> 01:16:17.172
THAT ARE ACTUALLY TO THE BUDGET

01:16:17.239 --> 01:16:18.273
COMMITTEE SO THAT WE CAN HAVE

01:16:18.340 --> 01:16:19.041
THOSE CONVERSATIONS GOING

01:16:19.107 --> 01:16:20.475
PERFECT. AND THAT'S AND THAT'S

01:16:20.542 --> 01:16:22.945
GOING TO BE ANNUALLY WORKS

01:16:23.011 --> 01:16:25.647
EVERY MARCH EVERY MARCH YES.

01:16:25.714 --> 01:16:29.251
PERFECT AND THEN THIS IS. IT'S

01:16:29.318 --> 01:16:31.486
OVERSEEN BY DEPUTY WITHIN

01:16:31.553 --> 01:16:32.054
DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY IS

01:16:32.120 --> 01:16:36.725
THAT CORRECT. YES OKAY AND

01:16:36.792 --> 01:16:38.226
DEPARTMENT TECHNOLOGY HAS THE

01:16:38.293 --> 01:16:41.697
CAPABILITY OF. OF OVERSEEING

01:16:41.763 --> 01:16:45.233
THIS SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF WORK.

01:16:45.300 --> 01:16:49.871
YES OF THE- THE- SURE THE BILL

01:16:49.938 --> 01:16:52.207
PROVIDES FOR THE CONTRACT WITH

01:16:52.274 --> 01:16:54.609
A THIRD PARTY ADMINISTRATOR AND

01:16:54.676 --> 01:16:57.346
SO- THE TECHNOLOGY THAT C. T.

01:16:57.412 --> 01:16:58.580
DOES HAVE A CERTAIN LEVEL OF

01:16:58.647 --> 01:17:01.216
EXPERTISE YOU KNOW. IT DIDN'T

01:17:01.283 --> 01:17:03.251
WORK IN UNDERSTANDING THAT. THE

01:17:03.318 --> 01:17:05.153
BROADBAND INDUSTRY INDUSTRY

01:17:05.220 --> 01:17:09.157
BUT- THIS IS VERY MUCH INTENDED

01:17:09.224 --> 01:17:11.593
TO DEPEND ON. THE THIRD PARTY

01:17:11.660 --> 01:17:12.728
ADMINISTRATOR THAT THEY WOULD

01:17:12.794 --> 01:17:14.496
CONTRACT WITH THAT WOULD- THAT

01:17:14.563 --> 01:17:16.098
UNDERPIN HAS AS A VERY THOROUGH

01:17:16.164 --> 01:17:17.299
AND IS INVOLVED IN THAT THEIR

01:17:17.366 --> 01:17:20.869
KNOWLEDGE EVIDENCE INVOLVED IN

01:17:20.936 --> 01:17:22.537
THE BROADBAND INDUSTRY. I'M SO

01:17:22.604 --> 01:17:23.939
I'M GONNA BE VERY DEPENDENT ON

01:17:24.006 --> 01:17:27.142
THEM OKAY WELL. I WILL BE ULLY

01:17:27.209 --> 01:17:28.677
TRANSPARENT WITH YOU THAT I

01:17:28.744 --> 01:17:29.878
CONCERNS ABOUT THE DEVICE

01:17:29.945 --> 01:17:30.746
TECHNOLOGY ARE PRETTY WELL

01:17:30.812 --> 01:17:33.348
FOUNDED IF YOU LOOK AT FISCALE.

01:17:33.415 --> 01:17:35.350
YOU LOOK AT THE I. T. PROGRAMS

01:17:35.417 --> 01:17:37.986
IN THE DMV YOU LOOK AT E. D. D.

01:17:38.053 --> 01:17:40.122
YOU LOOK AT CALVARY'S YOU EVEN

01:17:40.188 --> 01:17:41.690
LOOK AT THE MOST RECENTLY ARE

01:17:41.757 --> 01:17:43.892
ARE IN. THE STATE'S INABILITY

01:17:43.959 --> 01:17:45.027
TO DISTRIBUTE RENTAL

01:17:45.093 --> 01:17:46.561
ASSISTANCE. I THINK THAT

01:17:46.628 --> 01:17:48.463
THERE'S SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS OF

01:17:48.530 --> 01:17:50.866
THE CAPACITY AND SO WE'RE GOING

01:17:50.932 --> 01:17:52.768
TO INVEST IN I THINK RIGHTFULLY

01:17:52.834 --> 01:17:56.571
SO- FUNDING FOR BROADBAND AND

01:17:56.638 --> 01:18:00.175
CONNECTING- AND UNDERSERVED OR

01:18:00.242 --> 01:18:01.910
UNSERVED HOUSEHOLDS WE NEED TO

01:18:01.977 --> 01:18:03.078
MAKE SURE THAT THE MONEY GOES

01:18:03.145 --> 01:18:04.946
AS FAR AS POSSIBLE. AND AS

01:18:05.013 --> 01:18:07.149
EFFECTIVE AS POSSIBLE- I THINK

01:18:07.215 --> 01:18:10.152
THAT CONCLUDES MY QUESTIONS

01:18:10.218 --> 01:18:10.786
MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU SO MUCH.

01:18:10.852 --> 01:18:11.386

01:18:23.965 --> 01:18:25.367
FOR MANY MONTHS NOW ON THIS

01:18:25.434 --> 01:18:26.401
BUDGET I KNOW THAT YOU'VE BEEN

01:18:26.468 --> 01:18:28.203
WORKING NIGHT AND DAY OVER

01:18:28.270 --> 01:18:30.272
WEEKENDS. TRYING TO DEAL WITH

01:18:30.338 --> 01:18:32.307
ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS ACROSS THE

01:18:32.374 --> 01:18:32.941
STATE DEALING WITH PRETTY MUCH

01:18:33.008 --> 01:18:35.811
EVERY AREA- THAT WE FUNDS SO I

01:18:35.877 --> 01:18:37.312
WANTED JUST PERSONALLY THANK

01:18:37.379 --> 01:18:38.513
YOU FOR ALL OF THAT INCREDIBLE

01:18:38.580 --> 01:18:40.415
WORK. I DO WANT TO RAISE A

01:18:40.482 --> 01:18:45.720
CONCERN ABOUT- AB ONE FORTY IN

01:18:45.787 --> 01:18:48.090
TERMS OF THE SPENDING CAP- IT

01:18:48.156 --> 01:18:49.724
IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO ME TO

01:18:49.791 --> 01:18:52.561
SAY. THAT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE

01:18:52.627 --> 01:18:53.929
THAT WE SEND MONEY TO THE

01:18:53.995 --> 01:18:55.097
PLACES WHERE WE'RE EXPERIENCING

01:18:55.163 --> 01:18:56.832
THE MOST HOMELESSNESS AND THEN

01:18:56.898 --> 01:18:59.301
AT THE SAME TIME SAY AND WAS

01:18:59.367 --> 01:19:00.035
THAT PLACE HAPPENS TO BE LOS

01:19:00.102 --> 01:19:02.871
ANGELES. IT DOESN'T COST LESS

01:19:02.938 --> 01:19:04.906
PER PERSON TO SERVICE A PERSON

01:19:04.973 --> 01:19:06.141
ON THE STREETS IN LOS ANGELES

01:19:06.208 --> 01:19:07.709
AS IT DOES IN ANOTHER COUNTY OR

01:19:07.776 --> 01:19:09.911
ANOTHER CITY. IF LOS ANGELES

01:19:09.978 --> 01:19:12.013
CITY HAS THE HIGHEST POPULATION

01:19:12.080 --> 01:19:13.515
OF HOMELESS THEY SHOULD

01:19:13.582 --> 01:19:15.450
CERTAINLY HAVE THE SAME AMOUNT

01:19:15.517 --> 01:19:17.052
PER CAPITA AS ANY OTHER AREA OF

01:19:17.119 --> 01:19:18.820
THE STATE BECAUSE THIS IS THE

01:19:18.887 --> 01:19:20.122
EPICENTER OF OUR HOMELESS

01:19:20.188 --> 01:19:23.825
EPIDEMIC. AND SO I BELIEVE THAT

01:19:23.892 --> 01:19:24.993
WE SHOULD BE SPENT AN EQUAL

01:19:25.060 --> 01:19:26.361
AMOUNT PER CAPITA ACROSS THE

01:19:26.428 --> 01:19:27.863
STATE AND NOT HAVE AN ARBITRARY

01:19:27.929 --> 01:19:30.298
CAP THAT SIPHONS MONEY AWAY

01:19:30.365 --> 01:19:31.900
FROM LOS ANGELES TO SEND IT TO

01:19:31.967 --> 01:19:33.235
OTHER AREAS WHERE THEY WILL

01:19:33.301 --> 01:19:35.637
RECEIVE MORE PER CAPITA- THAT

01:19:35.704 --> 01:19:37.005
DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO ME UNLESS

01:19:37.072 --> 01:19:38.473
I'M MISUNDERSTANDING THIS IT

01:19:38.540 --> 01:19:40.008
SEEMS TO ME THAT. WE SHOULD BE

01:19:40.075 --> 01:19:41.409
SENDING MORE FUNDING INTO THE

01:19:41.476 --> 01:19:42.577
AREAS WHERE WE HAVE THE WORST

01:19:42.644 --> 01:19:44.012
HOMELESS PROBLEM MORE HOMELESS

01:19:44.079 --> 01:19:46.781
PEOPLE ARE CONGREGATING- WHERE.

01:19:46.848 --> 01:19:48.950
WE SEE THE HUGE IMPACTS OF

01:19:49.017 --> 01:19:51.686
HOMELESS PEOPLE- YOU KNOW WE

01:19:51.753 --> 01:19:52.821
REALLY NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:19:52.888 --> 01:19:55.090
WE ADDRESS THAT AND I EIGHT I

01:19:55.157 --> 01:19:56.825
DON'T UNDERSTAND ANY I CAN'T

01:19:56.892 --> 01:19:58.560
COME UP WITH ANY POLICY REASON

01:19:58.627 --> 01:19:59.794
WHY YOU'D WANT TO SPEND LESS

01:19:59.861 --> 01:20:03.632
PER CAPITA IN THE EPICENTER OF

01:20:03.698 --> 01:20:06.268
OUR HOMELESSNESS CRISIS. WOULD

01:20:06.334 --> 01:20:08.003
YOU LIKE TO BE. A FAMILY MEMBER

01:20:08.069 --> 01:20:09.137
FRIEDMAN I'M NOT SURE IF

01:20:09.204 --> 01:20:10.572
THERE'S- ABOUT THE QUESTION

01:20:10.639 --> 01:20:13.575
THAT I WOULD JUST ADD. THAT IN

01:20:13.642 --> 01:20:15.510
THE PAST WHEN WE HAVE- BUT

01:20:15.577 --> 01:20:17.879
CAPTAIN FOR HAP OR HOMELESSNESS

01:20:17.946 --> 01:20:20.282
SPENDING- IN REGARDS TO A LATE

01:20:20.348 --> 01:20:23.752
HUSBAND. WITH THAT. THE END

01:20:23.818 --> 01:20:24.686
TIMES THAT SOME OF THOSE

01:20:24.753 --> 01:20:27.222
DOLLARS HAVE- CAN ACTUALLY BE A

01:20:27.289 --> 01:20:30.091
BENEFIT. BENEFITS THEY'RE A

01:20:30.158 --> 01:20:31.860
BENEFIT THAT AREA DEGREE DEGREE

01:20:31.927 --> 01:20:33.995
BECAUSE OF THE SCALE- AND THE

01:20:34.062 --> 01:20:35.363
AMOUNT OF DOLLARS THAT ARE THAT

01:20:35.430 --> 01:20:37.132
ARE GOING TO THAT AREA SO THAT

01:20:37.199 --> 01:20:38.233
THEY CAN MAXIMIZE OUR TAKE

01:20:38.300 --> 01:20:39.701
ADVANTAGE OF THAT BUT I WILL

01:20:39.768 --> 01:20:41.136
TURN IT OVER TO CHRIS HOPE TO

01:20:41.203 --> 01:20:42.370
SEE IF THERE'S ANYTHING ELSE

01:20:42.437 --> 01:20:44.072
THAT. WE ARE I WANNA MAKE SURE

01:20:44.139 --> 01:20:45.240
I UNDERSTAND YOUR POINT IS YOUR

01:20:45.307 --> 01:20:48.543
POINT THAT IT SOMEHOW BENEFITS

01:20:48.610 --> 01:20:49.110
LOS ANGELES MORE TO RECEIVE

01:20:49.177 --> 01:20:51.446
LESS FUNDING. NO NO AT.

01:20:51.513 --> 01:20:53.114
APOLOGIZE FOR THAT I THINK THAT

01:20:53.181 --> 01:20:54.082
WOULD THERE WAS THERE IS A

01:20:54.149 --> 01:20:55.550
SENSE THAT BECAUSE THEY ARE SO

01:20:55.617 --> 01:20:57.619
LARGE. THAT THEY HAVE- THAT

01:20:57.686 --> 01:20:59.421
THEY CAN BENEFIT FROM SCALE IN

01:20:59.487 --> 01:21:01.089
TERMS OF BEING ABLE TO MOVE

01:21:01.156 --> 01:21:04.759
BACKWARDS. AND OR OR- I WOULD

01:21:04.826 --> 01:21:06.294
PROVIDE THE SERVICES AND

01:21:06.361 --> 01:21:08.630
PROGRAMS AT AT AT AT AT AT

01:21:08.697 --> 01:21:10.498
BURKE FOR CHEAPER ESSENTIALLY

01:21:10.565 --> 01:21:11.499
WELL I WILL TELL YOU THAT THAT

01:21:11.566 --> 01:21:13.468
IS CERTAINLY NOT THEIR

01:21:13.535 --> 01:21:15.670
FEELINGS. I LOS ANGELES DOES

01:21:15.737 --> 01:21:17.038
NOT FEEL LIKE THEY'RE GOING TO

01:21:17.105 --> 01:21:18.306
BENEFIT ENOUGH FROM SCALE THAT

01:21:18.373 --> 01:21:19.541
THEY'RE WILLING THAT THEY THINK

01:21:19.608 --> 01:21:21.176
THAT THEY SHOULD RECEIVE LESS

01:21:21.243 --> 01:21:22.043
MONEY PER CAPITA THAN OTHER

01:21:22.110 --> 01:21:23.912
PARTS OF THE STATE. I WOULD SAY

01:21:23.979 --> 01:21:25.981
THAT THEY HAVE A LOT OF REASONS

01:21:26.047 --> 01:21:26.615
WHY MAYBE IT'S HARDER TO

01:21:26.681 --> 01:21:28.116
SERVICE. THE HOMELESS

01:21:28.183 --> 01:21:31.019
POPULATION IN LOS ANGELES- NOT

01:21:31.086 --> 01:21:34.256
LESS DIFFICULT AND LOS ANGELES

01:21:34.322 --> 01:21:36.458
IS EXTREMELY CONCERNED ABOUT

01:21:36.524 --> 01:21:38.660
THE REDUCTION IN FUNDING- THEY

01:21:38.727 --> 01:21:40.695
ARE. FACING A HUGE ALMOST

01:21:40.762 --> 01:21:43.765
INSURMOUNTABLE. CRISIS WITH

01:21:43.832 --> 01:21:45.967
HOMELESSNESS- YEAH I MEAN I

01:21:46.034 --> 01:21:47.035
KNOW THAT THERE IS ISSUES IN

01:21:47.102 --> 01:21:48.203
OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE BUT

01:21:48.270 --> 01:21:49.404
I'M NOT FOR THAT THEY WERE

01:21:49.471 --> 01:21:50.205
APPROACHING AND MOST OF OUR

01:21:50.272 --> 01:21:52.941
AREAS. THE REAL SENSE OF ALMOST

01:21:53.008 --> 01:21:54.943
JUST HOPELESSNESS WHEN IT COMES

01:21:55.010 --> 01:21:56.278
TO THE GROWING HOMELESSNESS

01:21:56.344 --> 01:21:58.346
HOMELESS POPULATION. IN LOS

01:21:58.413 --> 01:22:00.015
ANGELES AND I DON'T BELIEVE

01:22:00.081 --> 01:22:01.683
THAT THIS IS THE TIME TO SITE

01:22:01.750 --> 01:22:02.651
TO TAKE MONEY OUT OF THAT

01:22:02.717 --> 01:22:06.388
SYSTEM AND SEND IT OTHER PLACES

01:22:06.454 --> 01:22:07.022
I JUST I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY.

01:22:07.088 --> 01:22:08.356
SOMEHOW IT SHOULD COST LESS

01:22:08.423 --> 01:22:09.591
MONEY TO SERVICE HOMELESS

01:22:09.658 --> 01:22:12.260
PEOPLE IN LOS ANGELES. AND

01:22:12.327 --> 01:22:14.296
APOLOGIZE FOR NOT BEING FAIR I

01:22:14.362 --> 01:22:15.297
WOULD ALSO LIKE TO ADD THAT

01:22:15.363 --> 01:22:16.564
THERE ARE A LOT OF OTHER

01:22:16.631 --> 01:22:19.267
BUCKETS OF FUNDS IN THIS-

01:22:19.334 --> 01:22:21.736
BUDGET NOT JUST IS THE HELP OF

01:22:21.803 --> 01:22:24.005
FUNDING- THAT- PROVIDE

01:22:24.072 --> 01:22:25.206
ADDITIONAL SERVICES MENTAL

OTHER SERVICES HOUSING AND

01:22:27.709 --> 01:22:29.477
HOMELESSNESS- BUT I DO WANT TO

01:22:29.544 --> 01:22:31.780
TURN IT OVER CHRIS COOK FOR.

01:22:31.846 --> 01:22:34.282
SOME SPECIFICS. YES CHRIS COOK

01:22:34.349 --> 01:22:36.751
WITH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- AS

01:22:36.818 --> 01:22:38.286
MISLI JUST INDICATED THERE ARE

01:22:38.353 --> 01:22:40.121
SEVERAL OTHER FUNDING SOURCES

01:22:40.188 --> 01:22:41.923
IN THE BUDGET. THAT DEFINITELY

01:22:41.990 --> 01:22:43.458
L. A. COUNTY- CITY CAN TAKE

01:22:43.525 --> 01:22:44.659
ADVANTAGE OF AND I WOULD JUST

01:22:44.726 --> 01:22:47.329
LIKE THE CARE- CLARIFY. THAT

01:22:47.395 --> 01:22:49.130
THE CURRENT METHODOLOGY ONLY

01:22:49.197 --> 01:22:52.634
REALLY IMPACTS- AT LAKE CITY L.

01:22:52.701 --> 01:22:55.503
A. R. THE CEO SEES IN THE AREA

01:22:55.570 --> 01:22:57.839
AND THE COUNTIES ARE NOT- HIT

01:22:57.906 --> 01:22:58.807
THAT THEY DON'T THEY WILL NOT

01:22:58.873 --> 01:23:01.209
HIT THAT CAP- AND I WILL ALSO

01:23:01.276 --> 01:23:02.877
NOTE THAT I DON'T KNOW IF I

01:23:02.944 --> 01:23:03.912
WOULD NECESSARILY SAY IF A

01:23:03.978 --> 01:23:06.014
REDUCTION FUNDING. THIS YEAR'S

01:23:06.081 --> 01:23:08.116
BUDGET PROVIDES A SUBSTANTIAL

01:23:08.183 --> 01:23:09.184
AMOUNT OF HOMELESS FLEXIBLE

01:23:09.250 --> 01:23:11.419
EIGHT- THE LARGEST THAT THE

01:23:11.486 --> 01:23:12.487
STATE HAS EVER MADE IN THIS

01:23:12.554 --> 01:23:15.790
AREA WHICH IS ALMOST DOUBLE THE

01:23:15.857 --> 01:23:16.725
HIGHEST THAT WHAT IT'S RECEIVED

01:23:16.791 --> 01:23:18.626
IN THE PAST. AND I WOULD AND I

01:23:18.693 --> 01:23:20.295
WOULD SAY THAT A LAKE CITY

01:23:20.362 --> 01:23:22.097
SPECIFICALLY IS GETTING EIGHTY

01:23:22.163 --> 01:23:23.832
ONE MILLION DOLLARS MORE THAN

01:23:23.898 --> 01:23:24.766
THEY HAD RECEIVED IN THE PRIOR

01:23:24.833 --> 01:23:26.601
YEAR- WHICH IS A FIVE STAR AND

01:23:26.668 --> 01:23:28.303
YET NOT A REDUCTION FUNDING

01:23:28.370 --> 01:23:29.371
CERTAINLY COMPARED TO PREVIOUS

01:23:29.437 --> 01:23:31.239
YEARS. BUT THE REDUCTION OF PER

01:23:31.306 --> 01:23:32.707
CAPITA FUNDING COMPARED TO

01:23:32.774 --> 01:23:34.442
OTHER REGIONS SO ARE YOU

01:23:34.509 --> 01:23:35.443
TELLING ME THAT THERE'S OTHER

01:23:35.510 --> 01:23:36.778
POTS OF MONEY THAT LOS ANGELES

01:23:36.845 --> 01:23:38.079
CITY CAN ACCESS AND OTHER

01:23:38.146 --> 01:23:40.548
CITIES CAN'T ACCESS. OR AND ALL

01:23:40.615 --> 01:23:41.616
THESE ARE THESE CARE ACT AS

01:23:41.683 --> 01:23:43.451
MONEY OR MENTAL HEALTH SO I'M

01:23:43.518 --> 01:23:45.353
GONNA ANSWER THE QUESTION ON

01:23:45.420 --> 01:23:47.422
THE PREVIOUS QUESTION WHICH IS.

01:23:47.489 --> 01:23:50.325
STILL LA CITY FOR THE NEXT YEAR

01:23:50.392 --> 01:23:51.025
IS GETTING A HUNDRED AND FORTY

01:23:51.092 --> 01:23:53.928
THREE. MILLION DOLLARS BY FAR

01:23:53.995 --> 01:23:56.197
THE LARGEST AMOUNT OF ANY CITY-

01:23:56.264 --> 01:23:57.832
IN THE ENTIRE STATE BECAUSE OF

01:23:57.899 --> 01:23:59.768
THE POPULATION. WHAT THEY ARE

01:23:59.834 --> 01:24:01.336
MISSING OUT ON THIS THIRTEEN

01:24:01.403 --> 01:24:03.405
MILLION SO. THEIR NEXT ELECTION

01:24:03.471 --> 01:24:09.077
IS FIFTY SIX MILLION- WHICH I

01:24:09.144 --> 01:24:09.611
WOULD HAVE AN ISOLATION IS

01:24:09.677 --> 01:24:11.446
INCORRECT. THE THEIR

01:24:11.513 --> 01:24:13.248
CALCULATION IS THAT IT'S A

01:24:13.314 --> 01:24:16.518
REDUCTION IN THAT NOT WITHOUT

01:24:16.584 --> 01:24:17.018

01:24:17.085 --> 01:24:18.787
WITHOUT THE CAP. URATE

01:24:18.853 --> 01:24:19.888
REDUCTION IS ABSOLUTELY THE

01:24:19.954 --> 01:24:21.923
WRONG WE'RE GOING TO BE USING

01:24:21.990 --> 01:24:23.658
BECAUSE IT'S BASED ON AND OUR

01:24:23.725 --> 01:24:25.660
BUDGET CONSULTANT CAN WALK

01:24:25.727 --> 01:24:27.028
THROUGH THE CALCULATION BUT

01:24:27.095 --> 01:24:28.663
THEIR CALCULATION IS INCORRECT

01:24:28.730 --> 01:24:30.298
OKAY GENEVIEVE MORALE YEAH

01:24:30.365 --> 01:24:31.499
THEIR CALCULATION IS NINETY SIX

01:24:31.566 --> 01:24:32.967
MILLION AND MISLEADING THE-

01:24:33.034 --> 01:24:35.003
MANAGER OF THE COMMITTEE. SORRY

01:24:35.069 --> 01:24:37.038

ASSEMBLY BUDGET COMMITTEE I

01:24:46.915 --> 01:24:48.583
MISS FRIEDMAN I THINK WHERE THE

01:24:48.650 --> 01:24:49.851
CONFUSION COMES IN IS IN THE

01:24:49.918 --> 01:24:52.387
BILL WHAT WE DID IS WE PROVIDED

PULLED OUT A BONUS POT SO THAT

01:25:00.662 --> 01:25:02.297
STARTS THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF THE

01:25:02.363 --> 01:25:03.965
POT OF FUNDING AT EIGHT HUNDRED

01:25:04.032 --> 01:25:04.999
MILLION AND I BELIEVE THE

01:25:05.066 --> 01:25:07.402
FUNDING THAT THE CITY OF ALLEY.

01:25:07.469 --> 01:25:08.937
PROVIDED FOR YOU WITH THAT ONE

01:25:09.003 --> 01:25:10.472

MILLION AT IN CURRENTLY IN THE

01:25:12.073 --> 01:25:13.041
BILL SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT THAT

01:25:13.107 --> 01:25:15.777
THE NUMBERS THERE THE DELTA

01:25:15.844 --> 01:25:18.313
BETWEEN THE TWO IS FIFTY AROUND

01:25:18.379 --> 01:25:19.380
FIFTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS THAT

01:25:19.447 --> 01:25:20.448
THEY'RE SAYING THEY'RE LOSING

01:25:20.515 --> 01:25:21.516
BUT THAT'S BASED ON UP BILLION

01:25:21.583 --> 01:25:23.218
DOLLAR POT. AND THE WAY THE

01:25:23.284 --> 01:25:25.420

01:32:03.084 --> 01:32:05.052
GO THROUGH THE TEDIOUS IT ISN'T

01:32:05.119 --> 01:32:06.287
SO THAT THAT HAS ALWAYS BEEN A

01:32:06.354 --> 01:32:07.788
CHALLENGE AND I THINK THERE IS

01:32:07.855 --> 01:32:09.590
WAYS THAT THINGS CAN WORK OUT

01:32:09.657 --> 01:32:10.791
BETWEEN AT THE LOCAL LEVEL

01:32:10.858 --> 01:32:12.360
WHERE. REGIONAL CENTERS CAN

01:32:12.426 --> 01:32:13.594
CONTRACT WITH SCHOOL DISTRICTS

01:32:13.661 --> 01:32:15.463
AND VICE VERSA BUT I. THINK AT

01:32:15.529 --> 01:32:16.397
THE STATE LEVEL THE CHALLENGE

01:32:16.464 --> 01:32:17.765
WE HAVE IS THAT YOU KNOW IF

01:32:17.832 --> 01:32:18.866
YOU'RE TRYING TO GO DIRECTLY TO

01:32:18.933 --> 01:32:20.301

OPPOSED TO NINE NINETY EIGHT

01:32:24.038 --> 01:32:25.106
GENERAL FUND SO THAT THAT THAT

01:32:25.172 --> 01:32:27.909
MAKES WILL COMPLICATED SO- BUT

01:32:27.975 --> 01:32:30.311
I DEFERRED TO. EITHER FINANCE

01:32:30.378 --> 01:32:33.214
OR- MY TEAM ON ON WEBEX AND

01:32:33.281 --> 01:32:34.248
THEY HAVE MORE DETAILS ON THAT

01:32:34.315 --> 01:32:36.384
OKAY. HEY JUST IF WE CAN WORK

01:32:36.450 --> 01:32:37.418
OFFLINE ON THAT MISTER CHAIR

01:32:37.485 --> 01:32:38.753
JUST TO MAKE SURE BECAUSE I

01:32:38.819 --> 01:32:40.121
THINK BECAUSE THINGS ARE SO

01:32:40.187 --> 01:32:42.523
SILOS THE THERE IS. A GROUP OF

01:32:42.590 --> 01:32:44.458
WHAT WE CALL TRAINERS THAT MAY

01:32:44.525 --> 01:32:46.560
BE CAUGHT UP IN THE- IN THE

01:32:46.627 --> 01:32:48.696
DIFFERENT CATEGORIES AND SO I'M

01:32:48.763 --> 01:32:52.533
JUST I'M JUST. A LITTLE BIT

01:32:52.600 --> 01:32:53.134

MEMBER FRAZIER I THINK I'M PART

01:33:05.613 --> 01:33:08.482
OF THE CONFUSION HERE IS- WHAT

01:33:08.549 --> 01:33:10.184
THE VARIOUS DIFFERENT PROPOSALS

01:33:10.251 --> 01:33:11.185
ARE THERE A LOT OF DIFFERENT

01:33:11.252 --> 01:33:12.253
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH RELATED

01:33:12.320 --> 01:33:13.854
PROPOSALS IN THIS IN THIS

01:33:13.921 --> 01:33:16.457
BUDGET- ONE OF WHAT THE FIRST

01:33:16.524 --> 01:33:18.359
ONE THAT YOU MENTIONED- HAS TO

01:33:18.426 --> 01:33:21.696
DO THIS IS PART OF KATHLEEN-

01:33:21.762 --> 01:33:25.333
WITH THE KAISER- CARVED OUT OF

AND THAT CARVE OUT IS THE

01:33:33.040 --> 01:33:35.476
ENDING IS CARD OF- COUNTY BUT

01:33:35.543 --> 01:33:39.647
IT WAS DELAYED- AS YOU I THINK

01:33:39.714 --> 01:33:42.883
MENTIONED TO BE PHASED IN- THAT

01:33:42.950 --> 01:33:45.252
WITH THE REST OF THE THAT SO

01:33:45.319 --> 01:33:46.754
IT'S SO IT'S DELAYED UNTIL THE

01:33:46.821 --> 01:33:48.589
OTHER AT BEAVER HEALTH REFORMS

01:33:48.656 --> 01:33:49.790
THAT ARE PART OF COUNTY BAR IN

01:33:49.857 --> 01:33:52.293

CONTINUITY CARE- PROVISIONS CAN

01:34:00.201 --> 01:34:01.669
BE IN PLACE. SO THAT'S THAT

01:34:01.736 --> 01:34:02.803
PART OF IT- IN TURN OF THE AYE

01:34:02.870 --> 01:34:05.239
I AM T. I THERE'S ALSO SOME

01:34:05.306 --> 01:34:06.841
KIND. AROUND THE FACT THAT THE

01:34:06.907 --> 01:34:08.809

THOSE PROPOSALS ARE MOVING

01:34:19.487 --> 01:34:21.622
FORWARD IN THIS BUDGET- BECAUSE

01:34:21.689 --> 01:34:23.624
OF THE CONCERNS OF COUNTIES AND

01:34:23.691 --> 01:34:26.193
FOR OTHER REASONS- AND INSTEAD

01:34:26.260 --> 01:34:29.030
IS THE BEST THING FUNDS FOR.

01:34:29.096 --> 01:34:30.965
THE DEVELOPMENT OF CAPACITY AT

01:34:31.032 --> 01:34:32.566
THE COUNTY LEVEL IN ORDER TO

01:34:32.633 --> 01:34:34.635
START SHIFTING SOME POPULATIONS

01:34:34.702 --> 01:34:36.237
THAT ARE APPROPRIATE TO THE

01:34:36.303 --> 01:34:37.605
COUNTIES IN ORDER TO CREATE

01:34:37.671 --> 01:34:39.106
MORE CAPACITY IN THE STATE

01:34:39.173 --> 01:34:41.308
HOSPITAL TO TREAT THE AYE IF HE

01:34:41.375 --> 01:34:44.011
POPULATION- AND THEN FINALLY IN

01:34:44.078 --> 01:34:47.515
TERMS. OF THE SCHOOL SERVICES

01:34:47.581 --> 01:34:48.649
THE GOVERNOR'S CHIU AND YOUTH

BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INITIATIVE-

01:34:52.053 --> 01:34:54.255
IT IT. IT I WOULD SAY PRIMARY

01:34:54.321 --> 01:34:56.123
PURPOSE IS TO CREATE A SYSTEM

01:34:56.190 --> 01:34:58.659

BASICALLY FOR RIGHT OF WAYS AND

01:37:25.005 --> 01:37:26.774
SO IF THE RIGHT OF WAY IT IT

IT'S REALLY JUST TOO IT'S A

01:37:28.275 --> 01:37:29.610
VERY NARROW AROUND RIGHT AWAY

01:37:29.677 --> 01:37:31.378

A LAN CABLE ALONG RIGHT AWAY

01:37:38.285 --> 01:37:39.920
RIGHT SO I UNDERSTAND THAT BUT

01:37:39.987 --> 01:37:41.689
SO FOR OUR RURAL COMMUNITIES

01:37:41.755 --> 01:37:43.557
THAT LAST MILE IS WHERE THERE

01:37:43.624 --> 01:37:45.292
IS NO CONNECTIVITY RIGHT SO IF

01:37:45.359 --> 01:37:46.527
YOU'RE LIVING IN A RURAL AREA

01:37:46.594 --> 01:37:48.729
IN ALL GOOD WILL SAY. AND YOU

01:37:48.796 --> 01:37:50.497
ARE TWO AND A HALF MILES AND

01:37:50.564 --> 01:37:52.099
YOU KNOW PUTTING UP TO THE

01:37:52.166 --> 01:37:55.302
NATIONAL FOREST- THAT FINAL

01:37:55.369 --> 01:37:57.938
MILE GETTING ACCESS TO THAT

01:37:58.005 --> 01:37:59.873
RESIDENT CONSTITUENT IS THE

01:37:59.940 --> 01:38:01.875
MOST COMPLICATED HAVING TO DEAL

01:38:01.942 --> 01:38:03.677
WITH THE QUOTE SO WHY NOT GIVE

01:38:03.744 --> 01:38:06.447
CONSIDERATION TO ANY EXISTING

01:38:06.513 --> 01:38:08.315
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORTS

01:38:08.382 --> 01:38:10.351
THAT COULD HELP EXPEDITE THAT

01:38:10.417 --> 01:38:16.957
PROCESS WILL ONLY SPECIFICALLY.

01:38:17.024 --> 01:38:19.593
AROUND THAT LAST MILE. IS I

01:38:19.660 --> 01:38:21.095
THINK I MAY WHAT I'LL DO SAVE

01:38:21.161 --> 01:38:23.163
FROM MY UNDERSTANDING IN TERMS

01:38:23.230 --> 01:38:23.931
OF THIS PARTICULAR BILL THERE'S

01:38:23.998 --> 01:38:26.333
A LOT OF THIS DIDN'T QUITE FIX

01:38:26.400 --> 01:38:27.368
EVERY PROBLEM WE'RE GONNA HAVE

01:38:27.434 --> 01:38:28.836
AN BROADBAND IN EVERY POSSIBLE

01:38:28.902 --> 01:38:30.070
SITUATION SO THIS IS TRYING TO

01:38:30.137 --> 01:38:31.405
GET A FRAMEWORK TOGETHER GIVEN

01:38:31.472 --> 01:38:32.473
THAT THE SIX BILLION DOLLAR

01:38:32.539 --> 01:38:34.174
PACKAGE BUT I DEFINITELY THINK

01:38:34.241 --> 01:38:35.876
THE MORE TO CONVERSATION HAS TO

01:38:35.943 --> 01:38:36.644
IS GOING TO HAPPEN AND

01:38:36.710 --> 01:38:37.845
OBVIOUSLY MORE OVERSIGHT

01:38:37.911 --> 01:38:38.746
BECAUSE AND THAT THIS IS

01:38:38.812 --> 01:38:39.747
SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO TAKE

01:38:39.813 --> 01:38:42.349
YEARS TO FULLY BOOK FILLED OUT.

01:38:42.416 --> 01:38:42.983
YOU KNOW IT'S ANTICIPATED THIS

01:38:43.050 --> 01:38:44.718
COULD TAKE THREE YEARS SO I

01:38:44.785 --> 01:38:45.486
THINK THIS IS THAT THAT'S A

01:38:45.552 --> 01:38:46.720
GOOD POINT TO BRING UP TO THE

01:38:46.787 --> 01:38:48.756
CONVERSATION BECAUSE I DO THINK

01:38:48.822 --> 01:38:49.323
WE'RE GONNA HAVE SUBSEQUENT

01:38:49.390 --> 01:38:50.057
LEGISLATION ON THIS GOING

01:38:50.124 --> 01:38:51.659
FORWARD EXCELLENT AND THAT'S

01:38:51.725 --> 01:38:53.027
JUST MY POINT IS THAT WE'VE

01:38:53.093 --> 01:38:54.795
SEEN THROUGH THIS PANDEMIC YOU

01:38:54.862 --> 01:38:56.330
KNOW OUR ROLE COMMUNITIES AND

01:38:56.397 --> 01:38:57.564
WHAT PLACES WERE THERE ISN'T

01:38:57.631 --> 01:39:00.267
CONNECTIVE ITTY- THAT IT WAS A

01:39:00.334 --> 01:39:01.302
DETRIMENT TO THEM THIS PAST

01:39:01.368 --> 01:39:03.070
YEAR SO ANYTHING WE CAN DO TO

01:39:03.137 --> 01:39:05.406
EXPEDITE THAT IN A SAFE MANNER-

01:39:05.472 --> 01:39:06.473
I THINK WE SHOULD MAKE

01:39:06.540 --> 01:39:09.943
PRIORITY. MY NEXT QUESTION IS

01:39:10.010 --> 01:39:11.712
I'M I'M REALLY HAPPY TO SEE

01:39:11.779 --> 01:39:13.614
THAT THE NEW CHILD CARE SLOTS-

01:39:13.681 --> 01:39:15.582
AND RATE INCREASES THAT ME AND

01:39:15.649 --> 01:39:17.184
MY COLLEAGUES ON SUB TO HAVE

01:39:17.251 --> 01:39:18.886
FOUGHT FOR SO HARD FOUGHT HARD

01:39:18.952 --> 01:39:21.155
FOR WERE INCLUDED I'M BUT I AM

01:39:21.221 --> 01:39:23.190
A LITTLE CONCERNED THAT YOU

01:39:23.257 --> 01:39:24.658
KNOW WHEN I TALK TO PROVIDERS

01:39:24.725 --> 01:39:27.061
SO WHEN I TALK TO YOU KNOW MY

01:39:27.127 --> 01:39:27.895
FAMILY WHO HAS A CHILD CARE

01:39:27.961 --> 01:39:33.300
CENTER- IT'S. REALLY HARD TO

01:39:33.367 --> 01:39:34.768
HIRE. EARLY LEARN FOR. RIGHT

01:39:34.835 --> 01:39:35.803
NOW. SO WHY DID THE

01:39:35.869 --> 01:39:36.804
ADMINISTRATION REMOVE THE

01:39:36.870 --> 01:39:38.672
FUNDING TO SUPPORT AND GROW THE

01:39:38.739 --> 01:39:41.508
WORK FORCE IN THIS. THIS AND IN

01:39:41.575 --> 01:39:49.083
SB ONE THIRTY WHAT. ACTUALLY

01:39:49.149 --> 01:39:51.485
WITH A PERMANENT FINANCE AND I

01:39:51.552 --> 01:39:52.086

BILLION DOLLARS OVER TWO YEARS

01:43:58.432 --> 01:44:00.701
THAT'S ALL A LOT OF MONEY- AND

01:44:00.767 --> 01:44:02.269
IT NEEDS TO BE STRESSED AS FAR

01:44:02.336 --> 01:44:04.438
AS POSSIBLE AND THROUGH. ALL OF

01:44:04.504 --> 01:44:06.039
OUR COMMUNITIES IN A- IN A FAIR

01:44:06.106 --> 01:44:10.377
WAY. I'M AND WHETHER THE-

01:44:12.112 --> 01:44:13.213
DOLLARS OR FIFTY SIX MILLION

01:44:13.280 --> 01:44:16.984
DOLLARS THIS IS A LOT OF MONEY-

01:44:17.050 --> 01:44:19.286
AT A TIME WHEN BUDGETS ARE

01:44:19.353 --> 01:44:21.421
BEING STRETCHED THIN AND THIS

01:44:21.488 --> 01:44:23.156
IS A TRUE IN EVERY CITY THAT

01:44:23.223 --> 01:44:26.193
HAS A- HOMELESS POPULATION.

01:44:26.259 --> 01:44:27.461
BUDGETS ARE BEING STRETCHED

01:44:27.527 --> 01:44:30.197
THIN IN AN EFFORT TO ADDRESS

01:44:30.263 --> 01:44:33.400
THE MANY ISSUES THAT. EXISTA

01:44:33.467 --> 01:44:35.936
AMONGST THE ON HOUSED IN IN OUR

01:44:36.003 --> 01:44:38.305
EFFORTS TO TRY AND RETURN-

01:44:38.372 --> 01:44:39.940
THOSE WHO ARE ON OUR STREETS TO

01:44:40.007 --> 01:44:43.243
HOUSING- I THINK IT'S EXTREMELY

01:44:43.310 --> 01:44:44.978
IMPORTANT THAT WE VIEW THIS OR

01:44:45.045 --> 01:44:47.514
THE THROUGH THE LENS OF EQUITY-

01:44:47.581 --> 01:44:51.618
AND- LOS ANGELES SHOULD NOT BE

01:44:51.685 --> 01:44:53.787
SHORT CHANGED BECAUSE- OF FOR

01:44:53.854 --> 01:44:55.589
ANY REASON AT ALL- THIS SHOULD

01:44:55.656 --> 01:44:58.792
JUST BE- FLAT OUT AN EQUITABLE

01:44:58.859 --> 01:45:00.661
DISTRIBUTION AND THE- FACT THAT

01:45:00.727 --> 01:45:02.796
THERE ARE OTHER. BUCKETS OF

01:45:02.863 --> 01:45:05.232
FUNDS OUT THERE- I THINKTHAT'S

01:45:05.298 --> 01:45:07.200
GREAT THAT'S ADDITIONAL MONEY

01:45:07.267 --> 01:45:08.502
THAT CAN BE SOUGHT BY ANY

01:45:08.568 --> 01:45:10.904
COMMUNITY BUT- THOSE FUNDS CAN

01:45:10.971 --> 01:45:15.575
BE SOUGHT BY ANY COMMUNITY- AND

01:45:15.642 --> 01:45:17.044
THAT SHOULD BE TRUE OF THE

01:45:17.110 --> 01:45:19.579
MAIN- A SOURCE OF FUNDING THAT

01:45:19.646 --> 01:45:23.016
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE TO THE

01:45:23.083 --> 01:45:23.884
TWO BILLION DOLLARS. I HAVE.

01:45:23.950 --> 01:45:24.618
IT'S OUR HOPE THAT THAT'S

01:45:24.685 --> 01:45:25.619
SOMETHING THAT THAT CAN BE

01:45:25.686 --> 01:45:29.656
ADDRESSED I DO UNDERSTAND THAT-

01:45:29.723 --> 01:45:33.193
THIS IS KIND OF A LEGACY FROM-

01:45:33.260 --> 01:45:34.928
A PRIOR DISTRIBUTIONS TO

01:45:34.995 --> 01:45:37.064
ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS- WHERE

01:45:37.130 --> 01:45:39.599
THERE WAS A CAP PLACED TO- IN

01:45:39.666 --> 01:45:41.935
TWO SUCCESSIVE YEARS. I ALSO

01:45:42.002 --> 01:45:44.504
UNDERSTAND THAT- PART OF THE

01:45:44.571 --> 01:45:46.373
ISSUE IS THAT THERE WAS NO

01:45:46.440 --> 01:45:52.412
HOMELESS CAP IN- IN IN TWENTY

01:45:52.479 --> 01:45:53.346
TWENTY ONE. AND SO WE'RE GOING

01:45:53.413 --> 01:45:55.782
BACK- AND LOOKING AT WHAT

01:45:55.849 --> 01:45:58.752
HAPPENED TO. IT WHAT THE COUNTS

01:45:58.819 --> 01:46:00.887
FOR LIKE TWO YEARS AGO- THAT

01:46:00.954 --> 01:46:03.090
SAID I THINK THERE'S A WAY TO

01:46:03.156 --> 01:46:04.091
THERE SHOULD BE A WAY TO

01:46:04.157 --> 01:46:06.359
BALANCE THIS OUT SO THAT IT IS

01:46:06.426 --> 01:46:09.029
FAIR TO EVERY A COMMUNITY AND

01:46:09.096 --> 01:46:11.932
CITY AND THE- THAT IS SAID NO

01:46:11.998 --> 01:46:13.567
LESS THE CASE WITH. LAWCENTER

01:46:13.633 --> 01:46:16.036
SHOULD BE NO LESS THE CASE WITH

01:46:16.103 --> 01:46:25.412
LOS ANGELES. BERMAN SKODA-

01:46:25.479 --> 01:46:27.814

AFTER THE BUDGET ARM I JUST

01:46:36.123 --> 01:46:38.091

PREVENTION ADMINISTRATIVE FUND

01:46:47.567 --> 01:46:49.903
OF THE INCLUSION OF- HAVING THE

01:46:49.970 --> 01:46:53.006
FEE BE A NEARLY INCREASE

01:46:53.073 --> 01:46:53.607
CONSISTENT WITH THE CONSUMER

01:46:53.673 --> 01:46:55.542
PRICE INDEX- I THINK THAT THE

01:46:55.609 --> 01:46:59.012
CONCEPT THAT IS. BENEFICIAL FOR

01:46:59.079 --> 01:47:00.380
THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA IN

01:47:00.447 --> 01:47:02.716

A BUDGET THAT IS- CAN BE A LONG

01:47:05.418 --> 01:47:07.420

AS POSSIBLE I THINK CERTAINLY

01:47:27.774 --> 01:47:30.277

IS VERY DISAPPOINTING. TO HERE

01:51:47.167 --> 01:51:49.602

IN THE FUTURE BUT WE THOUGHT

01:52:00.113 --> 01:52:02.082

01:52:34.247 --> 01:52:36.850
EQUITABLE. DISTRIBUTION BASED

01:52:36.916 --> 01:52:38.351
