WE'RE GONNA GET STARTED WITH THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEE ON CLIMATE CHANGE POLICIES. YOU PROBABLY KNOW MY NAME'S EDUARDO GARCIA. I THINK WE'LL HAVE A COUPLE OF OF OUR COLLEAGUES COMING OUT THROUGHOUT THE HEARING. BUT AGAIN JUST WELCOME EVERYONE. AT THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. CALIFORNIA'S CONTINUE CLIMATE LEADERSHIP IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER WE ARE NOW. NOT ONLY THE LEADERS IN OUR NATION BUT HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO THE REST OF THE WORLD TO ENSURE. OUR URGENT CLIMATE COMMITMENTS ARE MET. AB ONE NINETY SEVEN AB THREE ANY DIRECT THE COMMITTEE TO OVERSEE IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS AND OTHER RELATED CLIMATE POLICIES. FOR SURE LEGISLATIVE INTENT AS HONORED AND AT THE LARGER. STATE GOALS. THAT THEY MET. PASSAGE OF AB THREE NINETY EIGHT LAST SUMMER CREATED MARKET CERTAINTY BANKS AND THE CAP TRADE PROGRAM UNTIL TWENTY THIRTY. BUT IT ALSO MADE SEVERAL SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO THE PROGRAM. SEVERAL MONTHS INTO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS BILL. THE QUESTIONS HAVE BEEN RAISED ABOUT ALLOWANCE OVERSUPPLY AND DIRECT ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS. IT IS THOSE TWO ISSUES THAT THIS HEARING WILL FOCUS ON TODAY. IMPORTANT THAT WE TALK EARLY AND OFTEN TO ENSURE THE PROGRAM IS DESIGNED IN A WAY THAT WILL ACHIEVE THE TARGET WHILE ALSO CONTINUING A DIALOGUE. ABOUT WHAT OTHER MEASURES THE STATE CAN TAKE TO ENSURE EMISSION REDUCTIONS HAPPEN IN A WAY THAT LEADS TO PRESSURE ON THE MARKET. WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO ASK OUR PANELISTS. FROM MAYOR BE AT TO JOIN US AT THE TABLE INVITA. ANY OF OUR. THE OTHER FOLKS THAT WILL BE SPEAKING AS WELL. GOOD MORNING. MORNING. SO THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME HERE TODAY MY NAME IS EACH CHIANG MAI DEPUTY EXECUTIVE OFFICER AT THE CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD. STUCK OUT A HAND OUT TODAY IT LOOKS LIKE IT YOU'VE JUST RECEIVED THAT. SOME OF THE SLIDES ARE BACKGROUND AND INFORMATION AND I'M GONNA REFER. TO SOME OF THE OTHER SLIDES AS I GO THROUGH THE TESTIMONY TODAY. SO AS YOU MENTIONED IN YOUR OPENING STATEMENT LAST SUMMER THE LEGISLATURE PASSED IN THE GOVERNOR SIGNED. EIGHTY THREE NINETY EIGHT OFFERED ON AUTHORED BY THE CHAIR OF THIS COMMITTEE ASSEMBLY MEMBER GARCIA. SINCE OCTOBER TWENTY SEVENTEEN WE'VE BEEN HOLDING INFORMAL PUBLIC WORKSHOPS TO HELP INFORM OUR DEVELOPMENT OF THE CAP AND TRADE AMENDMENTS TO IT CONFORM THEM TO AB THREE NINETY EIGHT. THIS FOLLOWS THE BOARD'S DECEMBER TWENTY SEVENTEEN UNANIMOUS APPROVAL OF A SCOPING PLANNED TO MEET THE TWENTY THIRTY TARGET. WHICH INCLUDES A CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM AS DIRECTED BY THE LEGISLATION. WE'VE HAD THREE PUBLIC WORKSHOPS SO FAR TO DISCUSS POTENTIAL CHANGES TO THE CAP AND TRADE REGULATION BUT WE HAVE NOT YET MADE ANY FINAL DECISIONS. WE GOT SEVERAL MORE MONTHS TO WORK WITH STAKEHOLDERS BEFORE A PROPOSAL IS RELEASED FOR CONSIDERATION BY THE BOARD. AND I WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO COME HERE TODAY I'M TO SHARE INFORMATION ABOUT OUR WORKSHOPS AND HEAR YOUR THOUGHTS AS WE DEVELOP THESE REGULATORY AMENDMENTS. I'M I'M GONNA GO OVER SOME OF THE POINTS IN AND A. B. THREE NINETY A AND WHAT WE'VE HEARD FROM STAKEHOLDERS. AND AS YOU LISTEN TO THE THING THAT WE'RE HEARING IT MIGHT HELP YOU SORT OF ORGANIZE IT IN YOUR HEAD. TO KNOW THAT THE COMMENTS THAT WE RECEIVE SORT OF FALL INTO TWO GENERAL CAMPS. AND HE'S CANCER GENERALLY SUPPORT OF HIGHER PRICES IN THE PROGRAM. AND LOWER PRICES IN THE PROGRAM. SO FOR THIS RULEMAKING AS WITH OUR ORIGINAL PROGRAM DESIGN. WE'RE CHARTING A PATH TO MEET OUR CLIMATE CHANGE GOALS WHILE TRYING TO MINIMIZE IMPACTS TO CALIFORNIANS. I'M WE AIM TO DO THAT BY PRODUCING A STEADY PREDICTABLE AND INCREASING FOR PRICE. WITH DELINING EMISSION PERHAPS TO PROMPT INVESTMENTS AND ACTIONS TO ACHIEVE MID AND LONG TERM GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTIONS. ALL OF THE DESIGN FEATURES IN THE PROGRAM THE FLOOR PRICE THE CAP BANKING PROVISIONS HOLDING LIMITS THE AUCTION DESIGN. LEAKAGE PROTECTION OFFSET RULES AND NOW THE PRICE CEILING AND THE PRICE CONTAINMENT POINTS ALL OF THOSE WORK TOGETHER TO TRY TO ACHIEVE THIS GOAL. I'M OUR OTHER GOALS ARE ALSO LISTED ON FLIGHT TO IN YOUR HANDOUT. AS MANDATED BY AB THIRTY TWO WE WANT TO ENCOURAGE EARLY AND VOLUNTARY EMISSION REDUCTIONS. WE SEEK TO MAINTAIN AND CONTINUE TO ATTRACT LINKAGE PARTNERS. AND TO MAINTAIN THE MULTITUDE OF BENEFITS OF THE PROGRAM'S MARKET FEATURES COST EFFECTIVENESS FLEXIBILITY. AND MINIMIZING LEAKAGE. SO ONE OF THE AREAS THAT THE COMMITTEE SPECIFICALLY ASKED ABOUT. WITH THE AB THREE NINETY EIGHT MANDATED ANALYSIS OF QUOTE OVER ALLOCATION IN THE STATE BOARDS DETERMINATION OF THE NUMBER OF AVAILABLE ALLOWANCES FOR YEARS TWENTY TWENTY ONE TO TWENTY THIRTY. SO WHAT'S THIS REALLY ABOUT. IN CALIFORNIA WHERE IN THE ENVIABLE POSITION I BEING AHEAD OF SCOTT. SO WE'VE PROJECTS THAT WE'RE GONNA MEET OUR TWENTY TWENTY TARGET EARLY. AND SO THIS MEANS THAT EMISSIONS ARE LOWER THAN WE THOUGHT THEY WERE GOING TO BE. AND WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT COVERED ENTITIES DON'T HAVE TO TURN IN AND MANY ALLOWANCES. AS WE THOUGHT THEY WERE GOING TO HAVE TO. SO THERE'S A CONCERN BY IF YOU THAT THESE UNUSED ALLOWANCES THE ONES YOU DON'T NEED IN THE PRE TWENTY TWENTY. MAY HINDER OUR ABILITY TO MEET THE TWENTY THIRTY TARGET. I'M SOME BELIEVE THAT WERE AHEAD ENTITIES HAVE TAKEN EARLY ACTIONS TO REDUCE EMISSIONS. AND THEY SHOULDN'T BE PENALIZED. A FEW PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT REGARDLESS OF WHY EMISSIONS ARE LOWER UNUSED ALLOWANCES SHOULD BE REMOVED FROM THE SYSTEM EVEN THAT'S IT IF THIS INCREASES COSTS THE ECONOMY. AND FUEL AND ENERGY COSTS FOR CONSUMERS. WE CAN ALL AGREE I THINK THAT IT'S A GOOD THING THAT WERE AHEAD OF SCHEDULE THAT'S A GOOD PLACE FOR US TO BE. AND IT'S A GOOD THING THAT WERE ON TRACK TO ACHIEVE THE TWENTY TWENTY TARGET EARLY. ESPECIALLY BECAUSE AS WE LOOK POST TWENTY TWENTY WE'RE LOOKING AT HAVING TO DOUBLE THE RATE OF EMISSION REDUCTIONS SO WE'RE LOOKING AT A STEEPENING OF THE CURVE. I WON A NOTE THAT DROPPING POST TWENTY TWENTY CAPS I HAVE BECAUSE WERE AHEAD OF SCHEDULE MAY ENCOURAGE ENTITIES TO DO THE MINIMUM. IT COULD DISCOURAGE EARLY COMPLIANCE BY SENDING THE MESSAGE THAT WE COULD MAKE THE PROGRAM MORE STRINGENT IF THE EMISSIONS ARE LOWER. AND THIS APPROACH COULD LEAD TO A HIGHER COST PROGRAM. IN RESPONSE THE DIRECTION IN AB THREE NINETY EIGHT US STAFF COMPLETED AND MADE PUBLIC. AN INITIAL ANALYSIS LAST MONTH WHICH WE RECEIVE WHICH WE RELEASED FOR STAKEHOLDER COMMENT AND MORE INTERESTED I'M YOU KNOW WE'VE GOT SOME COMMENTS AND WERE INTERESTED IN FEEDBACK FROM THIS COMMITTEE AS WELL. I AM I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT THE ANALYSIS OF ANYTHING THAT YOU'RE ANALYZING TWELVE YEARS OUT INTO THE FUTURE IS GOING TO HAVE SOME UNCERTAINTIES AND I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT TO KEEP IN MIND. WE'VE LISTED SOME OF THOSE UNCERTAINTIES ON THE SLIDE ON SLIDE FOR. I AM I WANT TO START WITH THE GRAPH THAT'S ON SLIDE FIVE. AND IT SHOWS PROJECTED EMISSIONS. AND PARKS. AND SO THE SLIDE IS A LITTLE BIT COMPLICATED SOME TO TRY TO TALK THROUGH IT AND EXPLAIN WHAT'S HERE. SO THE BARS ON THIS SHOW EMISSIONS. AND THE LINES SHOW CAPS. SO THE GREEN BARS REPRESENT THE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS IN THE CAP AND TRADE COVERED SECTORS. OF TRANSPORTATION INDUSTRY AND ENERGY AND INCLUDES THE IMPACT OF COMPLEMENTARY POLICIES LIKE THE RENEWABLE PORTFOLIO STANDARD THE LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD ADVANCE CLEAN CARS. AND WHAT YOU SEE ON THE GREEN LINE THOSE ARE THE POST TWENTY TWENTY CAPS. IN THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM. AND YOU CAN SEE THAT THE GREEN LINE IS LOWER THAT THE GREEN BARS. THAT THE CAPS IN THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM CONSTRAIN EMISSIONS SAID WE WERE EXPECTING MORE MISSIONS THAN WHAT YOU WOULD THEN WHERE THE CAPS ARE. YEAH WE SHOW SIMILAR INFORMATION FOR TO PORTAL GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS SO IF YOU ADD ON THOSE BLUE ANDS THOSE ARE THE UNCOVERED SECTORS SUCH THINGS LIKE AGRICULTURE. QUITE GLOBAL WARMING POTENTIAL GASES AND THEN THE DOTTED LINE ABOVE IS SORT OF THE OCCULT THE GLIDE PATH OF THE SCOPING PLAN. YOU CAN SEE THE BLUE DOT AT THE END THAT'S THE TWENTY THIRTY TARGET. A TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY MILLION METRIC TONS AND AGAIN YOU CAN SEE THAT THE SCOPING PLANT THERE I'M SCRUBBING PLANNED TARGET IS LOWER THAN. THE ON A MISSIONS THAT ARE EXPECTED SO AGAIN YOU KNOW WE NEED TO REDUCE EMISSIONS TO HIT OUR TARGETS. NOW WITHOUT GETTING INTO TOO MANY OF THE DETAILS BASICALLY WHAT OUR ANALYSIS DID IT LOOK AT WHETHER THE POTENTIAL UNUSED ALLOWANCES. FROM PRE TWENTY TWENTY SO ALL OF THESE ALLOWANCES ARE GETTING USE NOW WILL ERASE ALL OF THE BENEFIT BETWEEN THE CAP THE GREEN LINE. AND THE PROJECT THAT EMISSIONS THOSE TOP OF THE GREEN BARS. SO TO DO THIS WE LOOK AT HOW MANY ALLOWANCES MIGHT BE AVAILABLE FOR PROPOSED TWENTY TWENTY. SO THAT INCLUDES THE POST TWENTY TWENTY ALLOWANCES SO WHAT YOU KNOW WHAT DOES THE PROGRAM PRODUCE. OFFSETS AND IT ALSO INCLUDES THE ALLOWANCES THAT MIGHT BE CARRIED OVER. FROM PRE TWENTY TWENTY AND THEN WE COMPARED THAT AGAINST THE EMISSIONS THAT ARE EXPECTED POST TWENTY TWENTY. SO WE DID TWO SCENARIOS WE DID ONE SCENARIO WHERE WE CARRIED OVER THE PRE TWENTY TWENTY EMISSIONS. AND WE DID ONE SCENARIO THAT WE DID NOT CARRY OVER THE PRE TWENTY TWENTY EMISSIONS. OUR ANALYSIS INDICATES THAT IN BOTH SCENARIOS OPPOSE TWENTY TWENTY CAPS. WILL CONSTRAIN GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND CONTINUE TO SUPPORT A STEADILY INCREASING CARBON PRICE SIGNAL. AS ALLOWANCES BECOME PROGRESSIVELY MORE SCARCE. NOW THE LEVEL OF THE CAP IS KEY TO OUR PROGRAM. AND I WANNA POINT OUT THAT THE CAPS IN OUR PROGRAMMER SAT USING REPORTED DATA. AND THE REFRACTIVE REFLECTS LESSONS LEARNED AND OTHER TRADING PROGRAMS SUCH AS THE EU ETS AND REGGIE. THESE PROGRAMS DIFFER FROM MARS AND THREE IMPORTANT WAYS. FIRST OF ALL. THEY DIDN'T RELY ON REPORTED DATA WHEN THEY SET THEIR CAPS. THEY EITHER HAVE NO PRICE FLOOR WHERE THEY HAVE A PRICE FLOOR THAT'S TOO LOW TO SORT OF ENCOURAGE REDUCTIONS. AND THEY ALSO DIDN'T ANTICIPATE HAVING TO HAVE SORT OF AN AUTOMATIC WAY TO REMOVE UNSOLD ALLOWANCES. SO BECAUSE OF THAT BOTH OF THOSE PROGRAMS HAVE HAD TO HAVE SIGNIFICANT CORRECTIONS OR ADJUSTMENTS. I'M TO CORRECT FOR OVER ALLOCATION SO THAT THEY HAD A HIGH ENOUGH PRICE TO PROMPT EMISSION REDUCTIONS. SO WHAT HAPPENS TO US WHAT WE'D DO IF EMISSIONS ARE LOW AND WE HAVE A LOT OF ALLOWANCES. WILL THE CALIFORNIA PROGRAM ALREADY INCLUDES A FEATURE FOR TRANSFERRING UNSOLD AUCTION ALLOWANCES INTO THE HIGH PRICE RESERVE AFTER EIGHT AUCTIONS. SO WITH ALLOWANCES DOWN DON'T SELL AFTER TWO YEARS THEY GET MOVED INTO THE HIGH PRICE RESERVE. AND THIS IS A PROVISION THAT'S NOW CODIFIED AS PART OF AB THREE NINETY EIGHT. NO WE ALREADY KNOW THAT THIS MECHANISM IS GONNA TRANSFER AT LEAST FORTY MILLION UNSOLD ALLOWANCES INTO THE RESERVE. DEPENDING ON HOW OPTIONS GO THIS YEAR THERE MAY BE MORE ALLOWANCES TRANSFERRED INTO THAT RESERVE. I AM I WANT TO KNOW THAT THE COMMITTEE REPORTS LIKE THE PAPER THAT CLAIMS THERE'S AN ERROR IN OUR STAFF ANALYSIS. REVIEW REVIEWED THE PAPER AND EVALUATED THAT CLAIM OUR CONCLUSION IS THAT THERE IS NO ERROR IN OUR ANALYSIS. SIMPLY PUT THE PAPER DOESN'T REALIZE THAT WE MADE AN ADJUSTMENT AND IT MAKES THAT ADJUSTMENT AGAIN. THE OTHER SPECIFIC ISSUE IS THAT THE PAPER CLAIMS THAT OUR ANALYSIS DOESN'T ADJUST. I CAPS TO ACCOUNT FOR THE PORTIONS OF COVERED SECTORS THAT ARE NOT COVERED FOR EXAMPLE FUGITIVE EMISSIONS FROM THE INDUSTRIAL SECTOR. SO THIS ISN'T TRUE. OUR CAPS IN THE POST TWENTY TWENTY PROGRAM ARE SET BASED ONLY ON THE PORTION OF THE INVENTORY THAT'S COVERED BY THE PROGRAM. JUST LIKE THE CAPS IN THE PRE TWENTY TWENTY PROGRAM. IN ADDITION FOR THE POST TWENTY TWENTY PROGRAM. BECAUSE WE ANTICIPATED WHEN WE DID OUR PROJECTIONS THAT EMISSIONS WERE GOING TO BE LOWER THAN WE PREDICTED. WE ACTUALLY LOWERED THE NUMBER OF ALLOWANCES THAT WE WOULD PROVIDE SO WE ACTUALLY REDUCE THE NUMBER OF ALLOWANCES BY NINETY FOUR MILLION METRIC TONS. AND THOSE EXTRA ALLOWANCES ARE GOING TO GO INTO THE HIGH PRICE RESERVE. SO WE TAKE OUT THOSE ALLOWANCES BECAUSE WE KNOW EMISSIONS ARE GONNA BE LOWER. SO TURNING NOW TO ANOTHER AREA THAT THE COMMITTEE ASKED ABOUT OFFSETS. SO UPSETS ARE AN IMPORTANT COST CONTAINMENT FEATURE IN OUR PROGRAM IT ALLOWS COVERED ENTITIES TO PURCHASE PURCHASE REDUCTIONS FROM SECTORS THAT ARE NOT COVERED BY THE PROGRAM. AB THREE NINETY IT REDUCES THE OFFSET USAGE LIMIT FROM EIGHT PERCENT. TO FOUR PERCENT BETWEEN TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. AND THEN INCREASES IT TO SIX PERCENT FROM TWENTY TWENTY SIX TO TWENTY THIRTY. AB THREE NINETY EIGHT SPECIFIES AT NO MORE THAN HALF OF THAT AMOUNT MAYBE SOURCE FROM PROJECTS THAT DID NOT PROVIDE QUOTE DIRECT ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS. IN THE STATE. IN THE WORKSHOP MATERIAL THAT WE'VE PROVIDED WE NOTED THAT OUR GOAL IS TO LOOK BEYOND JUST GREENHOUSE GAS BENEFITS AND WE USE THE EXACT DEFINITION IN THE LEGISLATION IN OUR RULE MAKING. I'M WE HEARD AND UNDERSTAND THE LEGISLATURE'S DESIRE TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF OFFSET PROJECTS IN STATE. AND TO LOOK FOR ADDITIONAL CO BENEFITS IN STATE SUCH AS THOSE CITED IN AB THREE NINETY EIGHT PRODUCTION AND OTHER AIR QUALITY POLLUTANTS AND AVOIDANCE OF POLLUTANTS THT COULD IMPACT THE STATE'S WATERS. I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT NOT FALL OFF THAT PROJECTS WE'LL BE ABLE TO MEET THE CRITERIA OF DIRECT ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS AS DEFINED IN THE LEGISLATION. I'M IN A THIS IS VERY CLEAR TO US WE'VE HEARD THE LEGISLATURE LOUD AND CLEAR ON THIS. AND TO ENSURE THAT ALL OF OUR STAKEHOLDERS ALSO UNDERSTAND THE LEGISLATIVE DISCUSSIONS THAT HAVE TAKEN PLACE AND THE INTENT WE'VE PROVIDED LINKS TO THE LEGISLATIVE HEARINGS ON THESE MATTERS. I'M IN OUR WORKSHOP MATERIALS OF FOLKS ARE AWARE OF THAT. AFTER EACH OF OUR WORKSHOPS WE ALLOW FOR AN INFORMAL WRITTEN COMMENT PERIOD TO ALLOW STAKEHOLDERS A CHANCE TO PROVIDE WRITTEN MATERIALS FOR STAFF EVALUATION AND CONSIDERATION. AND. IF THEIR SPECIFIC INFORMATION THAT THIS COMMITTEE WOULD LIKE US TO CONSIDER WOULD WELCOME RECEIVING THAT IN WRITING AS WELL. I AM AS I MENTIONED AT THE START OF MY TESTIMONY WE SEE A FEW PATTERNS EMERGING IN THE WRITTEN COMMENTS. I'M WE CAN PROBABLY CLASSIFY THEM AS BEING EITHER SUPPORTIVE OF HIGHER PRICES. OR SUPPORTIVE OF LOWER PRICES IN THE PROGRAM. ONE GROUP IS STAKEHOLDERS WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE SUPPLY OF ALLOWANCES AND OFFSETS REDUCED. ALONG WITH HIGHER PRICES FOR THE PRICE CEILING AND THOSE TWO PRICE CONTAINMENT POINTS. ALL RESULTING IN HIGHER COMPLIANCE COSTS IN THE PROGRAM. AND ANOTHER GROUP STAKEHOLDERS WOULD LIKE TO SEE A LARGER SUPPLY OF ALLOWANCES AT LOWER PRICE POINTS THEY WANT TO MAXIMIZE OFFSETS HAVE LOWER PRICES FOR THE PRICE CEILING AND HAVE AND THAT'S THOSE TO COST CONTAINMENT POINTS. AND AS I MENTIONED EARLIER OUR GOAL IS TO TRY TO DESIGN A PROGRAM THAT MEETS THE LEGISLATIVE MANDATES. TO BE COST EFFECTIVE AND MINIMIZE LEAKAGE WHILE MEETING THAT TWENTY THIRTY GOAL. SO BEFORE AND I WANTED TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW WE ENSURE THAT WE REMAIN ON TRACK TO THE TWENTY THIRTY GOAL. ON HOW WE GET TO TWENTY THIRTY IS JUST AS IMPORTANT AS ACTUALLY HITTING THE TARGET. WE NEED TO BALANCE THE MANY OBJECTIVES THAT'S BEEN THAT HAVE BEEN LAID OUT FOR US AND LEGISLATION COST EFFECTIVENESS. MINIMIZING LEAKAGE ENSURING PROGRAMS ARE TECHNOLOGICALLY FEASIBLE NOT IMPEDING PROGRESS TOWARD AIR QUALITY STANDARDS AND ACHIEVING GREENHOUSE BURKE GAS REDUCTIONS AMONG OTHERS. OUR GOAL IS TO TRANSITIONOUR ECONOMY AS SMOOTHLY AS POSSIBLE. A CLEAN FUELS AND CLEAN TECHNOLOGY WHILE CONTINUING TO GROW THE ECONOMY. THERE IS UNCERTAINTY AND WHETHER WE'RE GONNA MEET THE TWENTY THIRTY TARGET THIS IS SOMETHING THAT'S IT'S TWELVE YEARS AWAY. AND IN THAT TWELVE YEARS YOU KNOW WE NEEDS THERE'S UNCERTAINTY AND HOW MANY REDUCTIONS ARE REGULATIONS ARE GOING TO GET. HOW QUICKLY TECHNOLOGY PRESS PROGRESSES I'M POWER ECONOMY IS GOING TO BE PERFORMING TWELVE YEARS FROM NOW? SO IN THE FACE OF THAT UNCERTAINTY HOW DO WE TRACK OUR PROGRESS HOW DO WE ENSURE THAT WE'RE GONNA STAY ON THE PATH THAT WE NEED TO STAY. SU EACH YEAR UP CARP POSTS ON OUR WEBSITE A GREENHOUSE GAS INVENTORY. THIS IS A RETROSPECTIVE LOOK AT WHAT EMISSIONS ACTUALLY WERE. WE ALSO TO UNDERSTAND THE UNDERLYING CAUSES OF THOSE EMISSIONS WE TRACK FACTORS LIKE ECONOMIC ACTIVITY. FEEL USE WEATHER CONDITIONS GROWTH IN RENEWABLES DEPLOYMENT OF CLEANER VEHICLES AND A WHOLE HOST OF OTHER METRICS. ALL OF THESE METRICS INCLUDING THE GREENHOUSE GAS INVENTORY ARE PUBLICLY AVAILABLE. AND IN ADITION AND JUST AS IMPORTANTLY WE ALSO TRACK THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ALL OF OUR OUR PROGRAMS THAT ARE MOVING US TOWARDS. THESE GOALS SO WE TRACK IMPLEMENTATION OF THE LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD OF THE RENEWABLE PORTFOLIO STANDARD. OF THE ADVANCE CLEAN CAR PROGRAM AND OF THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM TO ENSURE THAT THOSE REGULATIONS ARE MEETING THEIR METRICS AND THAT THE NEEDED REDUCTIONS ARE OCCURRING. IF IT APPEARS THAT EMISSIONS ARE NOT DECLINING IS EXPECTED WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND WHY. IS IT BECAUSE WE HAD A OF A REALLY DRY YEAR AND SO WE HAD TO HAVE MORE ELECT NEO FOSSIL FUEL ELECTRICITY GENERATION BECAUSE WE DIDN'T HAVE AS MUCH HYDRO. WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH GLOBAL FUEL PRICES WHAT'S HAPPENING TO THE ECONOMY. OUR SECTORS RESPONDING AS WE ANTICIPATED. AND IF THEY'RE NOT WHAT PROGRAMS AFFECT THOSE SECTORS AND WHAT CAN WE DO TO GET BACK ON TRACK. SO THIS IS ALSO THAT WE CAN ASSESS WHAT THOSE TRENDS ARE WE REPORT UP PROGRESS TO OUR BOARD EVERY YEAR. ARE CHAIR PROVIDES AN ANNUAL REPORT TO THIS COMMITTEE. AND ONCE EVERY FIVE YEARS WE GET A CHANCE A SORT OF READ YOU THE WHOLE CLIMATE STRATEGY ONE RE READ TO THE SCOPING PLAN. AND THE THINGS THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT REALLY ARE. ARE WE ON THE PATH THAT WE THINK WE NEED TO BE TO GET TO THAT TWENTY THIRTY GOAL. SLIDE SEVEN AND EIGHT IN YOUR TAX SHOW ON THE CHECK IN POINTS THAT I TALKED ABOUT AS WELL AS MANY OTHER REPORTING AND OVERSIGHT OPPORTUNITIES THAT THE PUBLIC THE BOARD AND THE LEGISLATURE HAVE. SO IN CLOSING I WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR YOUR INTEREST IN THIS RULEMAKING AND FOR TAKING THE TIME THIS MORNING TO SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS WITH US. I'M OUR SCHEDULE HAS US RELEASING A STAFF PROPOSAL FOR FORMAL FORTY FIVE DAY COMMENT PERIOD IN THE SUMMER. AND THE FIRST BOARD HEARING ON THIS WILL BE IN THE FALL AND THEN WE WOULD FOLLOW THAT WITH THE FINAL BOARD MEETING ON THE REGULATION IN DECEMBER. SO WITH THAT I'D BE HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU. CAN YOU. GO BACK TO THE COMMENT ABOUT THE GUY CHALLENGES WITH THE. IN STATE OFFSETS THAT THE CHALLENGES THAT YOU FORESEE A. HEARING YOU CANNOT ELABORATE LOW. SO WHEN YOU SAY CHALLENGES YOU MENTIONED THAT IT'S GOING TO BE DIFFICULT RIGHT TO HAVE DIRECT BENEFIT. MEAN TO IMPLY THAT IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO HAVE DIRECT ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS I THINK. WHAT AND WHAT I MEANT TO CONVEY IF IT WAS NOT CLEAR IS THAT WE UNDERSTAND THAT THERE IS A LEGISLATIVE INTEREST IN INTENSE AS PART OF THREE NINETY EIGHT TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF? IN STATE OFFSETS I'M AND WE ARE AT THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE ARE AWARE OF HIS WERE GOING THROUGH THE RULE MAKING PROCESS. AS YOU KNOW AB THREE NINETY EIGHT ALSO SET UP A COMPLAINTS OFFSET COMMITTEE OR TASK FORCE I CAN'T REMEMBER EXACTLY WHAT IT'S CALLED. AND TO LOOK AT HOW WE CAN INCREASE THE NUMBER OF IN STATE ASSETS POST TWENTY TWENTY. SO AND THAT'S A COMMITTEE THAT WE ARE IN THE PROCESS THAT. WE'RE THINKING ABOUT WHAT ARE THE APPROPRIATE I'M INTO GROUPS OF PEOPLE THAT NEED TO BE REPRESENTED AS WE CONSIDER THAT BUT IT'S DEFINITELY SOMETHING THAT WOULD YOU KNOW I ACTUALLY TELL YOU THAT WE ARE ALSO. INTERESTED IN SEEING MORE IN STATE OFFSETS AS WE MOVE FORWARD ALSO ANTICIPATE A. MAJOR HURDLES AND MOVING IN THAT DIRECTION. WELL. IT'S I THINK IT'S IT'S HARD TO SAY THINK THE CHALLENGES THAT WE HAVE OVERALL OFFSETS OR. THAT IN. AT AS PART OF OUR PROGRAM WE LOOK FOR OPPORTUNITIES TERROR TO REGULATE. TO HAVE. REQUIRED EMISSION REDUCTIONS INSTEAD OF VOLUNTARY EMISSION REDUCTIONS AND IN SOME CASES IN THE PAST WHAT'S HAPPENED IS THAT YOU DON'T SEE AS MANY OPPORTUNITIES. TO HAVE THESE VOLUNTARY PROGRAMS BECAUSE WE'VE REGULATED THEM INSTEAD AND SO I THINK THAT THE AND THE REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT THAT WE HAVE MAKES IT SOMETIMES IT'S SORT OF NARROWS THE. OF WHAT'S AVAILABLE FOR OFFSETS ON BUT IT IS SOMETHING THAT WE THINK THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO WORK THROUGH IN THERE MAY BE SOME SECTORS WHERE WE MAY BE ABLE TO MAKE SOME PROGRESS. SO WE'VE HAD A QUESTION. I REYES TO OUR OFFICE QUITE OFTEN AS IT RELATES TO. HOW YOU DETERMINED? THE IMPACTS OF THE RECESSION. AT TWO THOUSAND TEN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN WHERE AREAS WERE WHAT THEY WERE POINTED OUT. THE CHAIR NOW. CAN'T CREDIT SOME OF THE. IMPACTS RIGHT OF BY THE RECESSION TO LOWER EMISSION ABSOLUTELY RIGHT AND SO THEN THE QUESTION IS WHAT YOU KNOW. WHAT WE JUST? MOVING FORWARD. THE CAT TO ACCOUNT FOR THAT RECESSION. AT THIS POINT SO I HAVE A I HAVE A DOG EXHILARATING SLIDE FOR YOU. AND SO THIS IS SOMETHING THAT. THE WHEN YOU LOOK AT. TRENDS YOU CAN DEFINITELY SEE THIS IS A GRAPH THAT SHOWS. GRACE DOMESTIC PRODUCT AND ALSO GHG PER PER GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT SEE YOU CAN SEE IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT THERE'S A BIG DIP IN THE GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT EMISSIONS YOU SEE A BIG DIP IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT ALSO. I'M FROM HARPER'S AND WHAT YOU'VE SEEN SINCE THEN IN THE LAST TEN YEARS IS THE LARGEST SUSTAINED PERIOD OF ECONOMIC GROWTH THAT CALIFORNIA HAS EVER SEEN. THE THING THAT WE FIND VERY HEARTENING THE THING THAT WE SEE. IS THAT. THE EFFICIENCY OF OUR STATE IS INCREASING SO EVEN THOUGH THE ECONOMIC OUTPUT IS INCREASING WE ARE NOT SEEING. INCREASE WE ARE NOT SEEN COMMENSURATE INCREASES IN GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS SO IF YOU LOOK AT GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION TRENDS OVER THIS TIME WHAT YOU SEE IS THE ECONOMY IS GETTING BETTER. AND THE WE ARE GETTING MORE EFFICIENT AT THE SAME TIME SO WE HAVE ACCOUNTED FOR THAT. BUT WE'VE ALSO SEEN AS WE LOOK AT SOME OF THESE OTHER METRICS THAT. OUR INDUSTRIES ARE ACTUALLY GETTING MORE EFFICIENT AND I THINK THAT THIS IS A BIG SUCCESS THIS IS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT CALIFORNIA CAN SAY TO THE WORLD IN THAT WE HAVE SAID TO THE WORLD. YOU DON'T HAVE TO. IT YOU DON'T HAVE TO GIVE UP ECONOMIC GROWTH TO SEE BENEFITS FROM YOUR CLIMATE PROGRAM THAT YOU CAN HAVE YOU CAN HAVE IT ALL. AS IT WERE. WE HAVE SEEN RIGHT ECONOMY GROW. DURING AND THAT WE'VE IMPLEMENTED. SOME OF THESE POLICIES ARE NOT BROKEN. EXCEPT THERE'S AND SO I THINK. TO THAT LAST POINT YOU MADE THERE'S CERTAINLY SOME CREDIBILITY BEHIND THAT STATEMENT. I DON'T KNOW FOR AYE IF THIS IS POSSIBLE AND YOU KNOW THE LACK OF. OF COLLEAGUES HERE TO ASK ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS BUT. YES I DO CHAIR OF THE COMMITTEE I MAY BE ABLE TO DO THIS RIGHT. THERE ARE SOME FOLKS IN IN THE AUDIENCE THAT THAT PERHAPS. HAVE SOME QUESTIONS THAT THEY'D LIKE TO POSE. AND IF OKAY WITHOUT. WELL WITH ME I GUESS RIGHT. I WOULD I WOULD DO IF YOU DON'T MIND. JUST FOR NO MORE THAN ABOUT FIVE MINUTES. OPEN UP THE THE MIKE AND HAVE SOME FOLKS UP POSE SOME QUESTIONS BASED ON THIS SIR. PRESENTATION THAT YOU'VE GIVEN SO. I'D LIKE TO WELCOME ANYONE. TO WHO WOULD LIKE TO. MAKE COMMENT OR A QUESTION RELEVANT TO THE PRESENTATION THAT WAS JUST MADE. I WELCOME YOUR PARTICIPATION. THE STATE YOUR NAME AND. ORGANIZATION YOU YOUR WITH GOOD MORNING CHAIR GARCIA DANNY COHEN WORD WITH NEAR ZERO ALSO A MEMBER OF THE INDEPENDENT EMISSIONS MARKET ADVISORY COMMITTEE. I WANTED TO RESPOND ARE ON A COUPLE OF ISSUES AND PERHAPS ENGAGEMENTS CHIANG AND IN OUR DISCUSSION WE CAN DO THIS DURING THE FORMAL TESTIMONY IF YOU PREFER. BUT I WANTED TO POINT OUT MISS CHANG TESTIFIED THAT THERE ARE THREE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE STATE'S CAPITATE PROGRAM AND THE CAPITA RATE PROGRAMS IN THE NORTHEASTERN UNITED STATES AND IN EUROPE. AND SPECIFICALLY SHE CITED THE FACT THAT WE HAVE A PRICE FLOOR WHICH IS INDEED DIFFERENT. AND SHE SUGGESTED THAT HARM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA RELIES ON ACTUAL COVERED SECTOR COVERED FACILITY MISSION STATED TO SET THE CAP UNLIKE WAS WHAT WAS DONE FOR EXAMPLE. IN THE EUROPEAN UNION. AND SHE SAID THAT WE HAVE A SELF CORRECTING AUCTION MECHANISM AND I JUST WANNA POINT OUT. OF MISS CHENEY TESTIFIED THAT THERE WERE ABOUT FORTY MILLION TONS THAT WILL BE REMOVED FROM THE ALLOWANCES THAT CAME FROM THE AUCTION COLLAPSE OF TWENTY SIXTEEN TO TWENTY SEVENTEEN. I'M NINETEEN YEARS ARE DISPARATE REPORT WE AGREE. THAT'S THE MINIMUM NUMBER THE MAXIMUM NUMBER WE CALCULATED AROUND SIXTY SIX MILLION. SO THERE'S A RELATIVELY MODEST BALLPARK TWENTY FIVE MILLION POSSIBLE INCREMENT. IN OVER ALLOCATION REDUCTIONS. IF MULTIPLE OPTIONS THIS YEAR DON'T SELL OUT. NOW THAT'S A SMALL FRACTION OF THE TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY MILLION THAT FOR EXAMPLE CHRIS BUSH ESTIMATES JUST ROUGHLY IN LINE WITH WHAT OTHER INDEPENDENT ANALYSTS HAVE POINTED OUT. TO JUST ONE RESPOND AS TO THIS PARTICULAR DISTINCTION THERE'S NOT A LOT THERE. I THINK THE KEY ISSUE AND I WOULD LOVE TO ENGAGE IN HIS CHIANG ON THIS QUESTION IS WHETHER NOT YOU'VE ACTUALLY USED THE FIT A FACILITY LEVEL DATA PROJECT TO PROJECT THE CAPS. SO AS YOU TESTIFIED WHEN AIR BE SET THE ORIGINAL CAPS IN TWENTY TEN. EVERY VERY CAREFULLY SAID WE CANNOT LOOK AT BROAD SECTOR DATA TO SET THE CAPS WE MUST USE FACILITY LEVEL DATA INSTEAD. AND THE ORIGINAL CAPS WERE SET USING FACILITY LEVEL DATA AS YOU SUGGEST. HOWEVER THE CALCULATIONS THAT YOUR AGENCY RELEASED AT LAST MONTH DO NOT DO THAT. AND YOU TESTIFIED THAT IN FACT THEY DO. AND THIS SEEMS TO BE INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT POINT OF DIFFERENCE BECAUSE THE ERROR THAT MY TEAM HAS IDENTIFIED. IS QUITE SIGNIFICANT. AND WE CHECKED THE PRIMARY SOURCES YOU USED SO I'D BETTER APPRECIATE YOUR CLARIFICATION. I WHEN YOU SAY THERE'S NO AARON CALCULATIONS AS TO WHERE THAT COMES FROM. S. CHURCH SO WITH THE WAY THAT WE SAT THAT WAY THAT WE SET THE CAPS ALL TALK THIS WAY IT'S EASIER. THAT WAY THAT WE THOUGHT THE CAPS POSTS TWENTY TWENTY BASICALLY RATCHETS DOWN THE CAPS THAT WE SET UP. TWENTY TWENTY. AND THIS IS DESCRIBED IN THE RULE MAKING THAT WE DID IN TWENTY SIXTEEN TO SAT THE POST TWENTY TWENTY CAPS SO THEY'RE BASICALLY IT'S THE EXACT SAME METHODOLOGY AND WE JUST RATCHETED DOWN SO IT'S USING THE EXACT SAME METHODOLOGY THAT WE DID IN TWENTY TEN. FOR TO SET THAT THE. THAT PRE TWENTY TWENTY CAPS IS WHAT WE USE FOR THE POST TWENTY TWENTY CAPS. OKAY URGING PATTY WITH THE AMERICAN CARBON REGISTRY. IDINA AND THINKING ABOUT THE END DIAZ SAID PROJECT TYPES THAT REDUCE SHORT LIVED CLIMATE POLLUTANTS. AND THE FACT THAT WE USE A ONE HUNDRED YEAR TWP FOR OFFSETS ACCOUNTING PURPOSES FOR. JG COUNTY PERSON THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM FOR THOSE. AND YET THERE. THE WARMING POTENTIAL OF THOSE IS ROUTE IS REALLY REALIZED WITHIN MUCH SHORTER. TIME FRAMES. AND SO YOU KNOW UNDERSTANDING THAT WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO KICK TO COMPARE APPLES TO APPLES CO TWO REDUCTIONS ON HUNDRED YOUR TIME SCALE. WITH METHANE ORDER PRODUCTIONS AN HONOR TIMESCALE. BUT EARNED IF WE LOOK AT A MEANINGFUL TIME FRAME FRESNO CP'S IT'S IN OVERLOOKING A TWENTY YEARS WHERE WHERE WE HAVE A. MUCH HIGHER GWP FOR THOSE. SO I MEAN WHAT IT WOULD BE FAIR TO SAY THAT WE. EFFECTIVELY HAVE A NET. CLIMATE BENEFIT. BECAUSE WHERE. YOU KNOW COUNTING THE REDUCTIONS UNDER YOUR TIME SCALE BUT REALIZING THE BENEFIT. ON A TWENTY YEAR TIME SKILL SO RELEASED REALIZING MORE KIND OF BENEFITS AND WE'RE COUNTING FOR. THE. WITH THOSE REDUCTIONS IN A AND WENT AND LEADING CLEAR I I THINK I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING I. I THINK THAT THAT MIGHT BE ON A THAT MIGHT BE ONE WAY TO LOOK AT IT I ALSO THINK THAT. I'M AS WERE THINKING THROUGH. MAKING SURE THAT WITHIN THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM WE HAVE AN APPLES TO APPLES COMPARISON IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE LOOK AT ALL OF THE REDUCTIONS IN WITHIN THAT PROGRAM FROM. BUT SINGLE. AT A SINGLE A GLOBAL WARMING POTENTIAL PERIOD. AND SO YOU KNOW I DID FOR THE COMMITTEES. INFORMATION WHEN WE'D TO FOR EXAMPLE THE SHORTLY CLIMATE PUTTING PLAN WHEN DO WE DO REGULATIONS THAT FOCUS ON. A METHANE LIKE OUR OIL AND GAS REGULATION THAT WE RECENTLY DID WE ALWAYS SHOW ON THE SHORT LIVED CLIMATE BENEFITS ON THE TWENTY YEAR GLOBAL WARMING POTENTIAL BECAUSE THAT IS ONE OF THE BIG BENEFITS AS OF UP THOSE REGULATIONS. IS THAT WE GET MORE BANG FOR OUR BUCK AS IT WERE SO AND THE ABILITY TO TAKE SOME OF THE SHORT LIVED CLIMATE POLLUTANTS OUT OF THE AIR THEY'RE NOT. AND BECAUSE THEY FALL OUT OF THAT IF YOU REDUCE FEWER OF THEM THEY FALL OUT OF FEAR MORE QUICKLY SO YOU SEE A BIGGER BENEFIT. ONTO THE ATMOSPHERE MORE QUICKLY SO I'M ETHIC THAT MIGHT BE WHAT ONE WAY TO LOOK AT IT BUT I DON'T THINK IT WOULD REALLY AFFECT HOW WE ON. CREDIT THINGS. I GOOD MORNING I'M WILL BEAR WITH THE AMERICAN LUNG ASSOCIATION AND I WANT TO JUST KIND OF REACTING AND POSE A QUESTION RELATED TO YOUR. NOTE THAT YOU KNOW LOOKING FOR TWELVE YEARS TWENTY THIRTY THERE'S A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY AS FAR AS HOW WE MEET THE TARGET. AND GETTING THEIR BEING AS IMPORTANT AS HOW WE GET THERE. AS WE LOOK AT IT AND SAY YOU KNOW THERE IS UNCERTAINTY BUT. HOW DO YOU ENVISION? OUT THROUGH THIS PROCESS AND OTHER PROCESS REALLY MAKING SURE THAT THERE IS CERTAINTY THAT TO THOSE ARE QUALITY BENEFITS IN THE PUBLIC HEALTH BENEFITS AS WE GO FORWARD. AYE WE LOOK AT AB SIX ONE SEVEN ELSE IF ASSN THE THINGS YOU MENTION. IT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT BUT JUST WONDER IF YOU HAVE ANY FURTHER THOUGHTS WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF. THE COVENTRY DISCUSSION IN THAT UNCERTAINTY HOW WE GET TO THOSE. CLEANER BENEFITS. THANK YOU WELL. I THINK THAT AS WE LOOK AT ANYTHING THAT WERE PROJECTING OUT TWELVE YEARS INTO THE FUTURE THERE'S A LOT THAT WE DON'T KNOW THAT'S GONNA HAPPEN TWELVE YEARS OUT AND I THINK THAT THAT'S WHY THE TRACKING PIECE OF IT IS SO CRITICAL. WE HAVE THIS PROCESS TO HAVE ANNUAL UPDATES TO A ANNUALLY BE ABLE TO LOOK AT OUR GREENHOUSE GAS INVENTORY TO ANNUALLY REPORT TO THIS COMMITTEE TO ANNUALLY REPORT TO OUR BOARD. AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT. YOU KNOW IT I TALKED IN MY TESTIMONY ABOUT HOW POSTS TWENTY TWENTY WHERE WE SEE WE NEED TO DOUBLE THE RATE OF EMISSION REDUCTIONS. SO RIGHT NOW WE MIGHT BE REDUCING EMISSIONS YOU KNOW THE THE. PATH THAT WERE ON WE MIGHT REDUCING EMISSIONS FIVE TO SIX MILLION METRIC TONS. A YEAR. POSTS TWENTY TWENTY WERE LOOKING AT SOMETHING LIKE A THIRTEEN MILLION METRIC TONS OF EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS A YEAR. AND IT'S HARD TO SORT OF AND PUT THAT INTO CONTEXT BUT YOU KNOW ONE WAY TO THINK ABOUT THAT IS. THE TOTAL EMISSIONS FROM ALL FOOD PROCESSORS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS TWO MILLION METRIC TONS A YEAR. SO IT'S A PRETTY BIG REDUCTION OR ASKING FOR EVERY YEAR. AND AS WE START LOOKING AT. AS WE START GETTING INTO POST WHEN TWENTY IN OUR PROGRAMS REALLY NEED TO START BITING AND. I THINK EARLY ON IN THE EARLY TWENTY TWENTIES IN TWENTY TWENTY THREE TWENTY TWENTY FOUR IF WE'RE NOT SEEING A SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE IN THE RATE OF EMISSION REDUCTIONS. WE KNOW THAT WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE ON TRACK THIS IS NOT SOMETHING YOU KNOW TWENTY TWENTY NINE BURRITO OWN KNOW THERE'S A PROBLEM. YOU'RE GONNA SEE ARE FOR NAUGHT IF THE LINE ISN'T LIKE THIS AND IT'S MORE LIKE THIS OR LIKE THIS OR EVEN WORSE LIKE THIS. WE'RE GOING TO KNOWING GOING TO BE NEED TO BE ABLE TO ADJUST FOR THAT. BECAUSE THIS ONE AND MAYBE HAVE A FINAL QUESTION AFTER THAT THAT ANYONE ELSE ONCE LINED UP. THANK YOU TERRACE SIERRA. THINKING IS TRYING. I'D LIKE TO GO BACK TO THE THE ASSERTION YOU MADE A COUPLE OF TIMES THAT. THE COMMENTS TEND TO GROUP INTO. TWO CAMPS THOSE IN FAVOR OF HIGHER PRICES AND LOWER PRICES AND WHEN YOU ADDRESS THAT. DISTINCTION. I FOUND THAT AND. SURPRISING. BECAUSE. YOU KNOW A ADDRESS THE THAT THE BULK OF THE CONTENT OF MANY OF THE COMMENTS THAT SAY THAT. THERE IS A CONCERN THAT THE WAY THE MARKET RULES MAY NOT SUFFICIENTLY. THE EXCUSE ME THE WAY THE MARKET RULES ARE WRITTEN. RISKS CREATING A MARKET THAT MIGHT NOT. INCENTIVIZE SUFFICIENT REDUCTION SMITH MEET THE TARGETS. I DID NOT SEE A TON OF COMMENTS THAT SAID WE IS SPECIFICALLY WANT HIGH PRICES I THINK MOST PEOPLE WANT LOW PRICES. THE QUESTION IS WHETHER WE'RE CREATING A MARKET THAT CAN ACTUALLY DRIVE THOSE EMISSION REDUCTION. AND THAT HAS ROOM IN THE MARKET FOR THE PRICE DISCOVERY TO OCCUR SO THAT INVESTMENTS OCCUR THAT ACTUALLY CREATE THOSE REDUCTIONS. RATHER THAN PURSUING LOW MARKET PRICES POTENTIALLY AT THE EXPENSE OF OTHER GOALS. AND SO IT'S THE QUESTION IS IS THERE ARM. THERE'S IMPLIED IN YOUR SLIDES I THINK THAT. THE QUESTION OF WHETHER THE MARKET PRODUCES LOW PRICES ALWAYS LOW PRICES AS POSSIBLE. OR HAS ROOM FOR PRICES TO. TO RANGE ACROSS A WIDER RANGE. THERE'S AN IMPLICATION THAT THERE IS NO ENVIRONMENTAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HOW THAT SET UP THAT THERE'S NO DISTINCTION BETWEEN WHETHER WE HAVE THE CLIMATOLOGISTS ARE NOT. AND I'M WONDERING IF THEY ARE BE HAS ANALYZE THE DIFFERENT SETS OF MARKET RULES TO SEE WHAT THE EFFECTS ON THE ENVIRONMENTAL OUTCOMES WILL BE BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S REALLY. THE MAIN THING THAT A LOT OF FOLKS ARE ASKING FOR PLEASE PROVIDE US WITH EVIDENCE. THAT THE ROUTE COMBINATION OF RULES THAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT ACTUALLY PRODUCES RESULTS THAT ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE SCOPING PLAN. SO THAT YOU KNOW I AM. SIMPLIFYING THE KINDS OF COMMENTS THAT WERE RECEIVING IN THE PROCESS AND I WOULD SAY THAT. THERE ARE. IT. YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE AND I I THINK THAT WE HAVE MANY OF THE SAME GOALS THAT WE WANT TO SEE. A STEADY AND PREDICTABLE MARKET PRICE IF THE PRICE IS TOO LOW AS WE SAW IN THE YEAR AND AS WE SAW AND REGGIE. AND YOU ARE NOT GOING TO SEE ENTITIES ACTUALLY TAKING ACTION TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE ALL WANT. ON THE OTHER HAND WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE PRICES BE HIGHER THAN THEY NEED TO BE TO GET THE EMISSION REDUCTIONS AND I THINK THAT THAT'S REALLY ONE OF. THE CHALLENGES THAT WE HAVE AS WE GO THROUGH THIS PROCESS THAT'S PARTLY WHY WE'RE GOING THROUGH THIS RULE MAKING PROCESS AND INTERESTED IN HEARING FROM A BROAD VARIETY OF FOLKS STAKEHOLDERS AS WELL AS THE LARGEST LEGISLATURE ON THIS. SEEING NO ONE ELSE LINED UP FOR ASKING QUESTIONS THAT. YOU THINK YOU FOR THINKING A TROOPER. AND THIS ONE KIND OF UNCONVENTIONAL BUT YET I THINK IMPORTANT TO HAVE A LITTLE MORE. OPEN DIALOGUE WITH SOME OF OUR STAKEHOLDERS WERE HERE. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE THIS MORNING WE CERTAINLY. I ANTICIPATE THAT THERE WILL BE IS LIST OF QUESTIONS WILL COME FROM SOME OF OUR COLLEAGUES WERE NOT HERE. WHO ANTICIPATED DAM TO BE HERE AND BE ABLE TO ASK QUESTIONS OF LOOK LOOK FOR THOSE FROM THE COMMITTEE AS WELL THANK YOU AND THANKS A LOT FOR THE NETFINITY INCLUDE COST IN EXCESS SAID OF? THE PRESENTERS THAT DANNY AND UNCLE MART WITH THE INDEPENDENCE IN MARKET. AND COSTS IN THE INDEPENDENT MISSION MARC ADVISORY COMMITTEE. AND ROSS BROWN. THAT WITH THE LA ELSE OFFICE BUT YOU MAY BE YOU MAY BE A. THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING MR GARCIA THANK FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE MY NAME IS STANLEY COHEN WORD. I'M A MEMBER OF THE TEAM AT THAT RESEARCH NONPROFIT NEAR ZERO AND A MEMBER OF THE INDEPENDENT EMISSIONS MARKET ADVISORY COMMITTEE. I HAVE THREE ISSUES I'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT TODAY. ARE AND I'LL SPEND MOST MY TIME ACTUALLY RESPONDING I THINK TO SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT MISS CHANG BROUGHT UP THE IN HER RECENT TESTIMONY TO YOU. IT'S THE FIRST TWO ISSUES I'D LIKE TO REFER TO OUR IN THE HANDOUT I PROVIDED TO THE COMMITTEE. AND THEY RELATE TO THE ISSUE OF CARBON OFFSETS AYE WHICH YOU DISCUSSED A LITTLE IN YOUR OPENING REMARKS. THE FIRST ISSUE I JUST WANNA RAISES A AS YOU KNOW MISTER GARCIA THREE NINETY EIGHT SPECIFICALLY SETS NEW LIMITS ON THE USE OF CARBON OFFSETS IN THE POST TWENTY TWENTY MARKET PERIOD. SUCH THAT NO MORE THAN FOUR PERCENT OF EMISSIONS IN THE PROGRAM CAN BE SATISFIED BY OFFSETS IN THE YEARS TWENTY TWENTY ONE THROUGH TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. AND THAT SIX PERCENT IN THE YEARS TWENTY TWENTY SIX TO TWENTY THIRTY. THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE COMMITTEE TO BE AWARE THAT THE PROPOSAL THAT THEY ARE BE HAS PUT FORWARD INFORMALLY AT THE STAGE. WOULD IN FACT APPLY THAT HIGHER SIX PERCENT LIMIT TO THE BULK OF THE MISSIONS OCCURRING IN THE YEARS TWENTY TWENTY FOUR AND TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. WE CALCULATE THAT THAT'S ABOUT EIGHT POINT FIVE MILLION ADDITIONAL OFFSET CREDITS IF THAT LIMIT IS FULLY EXPLOITED. A YOU SHOULD JUST BE AWARE OF THAT IF THAT'S CONSISTENT WITH YOUR VIEWS ON THE INTENTION OF THE BILL. THAT'S AN IMPORTANT ASPECT AS TO THE TOTAL OFFSET LIMITS. ARE THE SECOND OFFSETS ISSUE YOU MENTIONED IS IS WITH ESPECT TO DEFINING DIRECT ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS AND I APPRECIATE. OF BOTH THE BOARD'S DISCUSSION AS WELL AS YOUR OWN INTEREST IN THIS. DEFINING THIS TERM AND DOING SO IN A WAY THAT'S VERY CAREFUL AND RESPECTS ALL THE LEGITIMATE INTERESTS IN THE PROCESS WILL TAKE TIME ON SHORE AND EFFORT. BUT OWN EMPHASIZE FOR THE COMMITTEE THAT THUS FAR THE BOARD HAS BEEN UNWILLING TO RULE OUT THE ARGUMENT THAT PROJECTS CAN QUALIFY FOR DIRECT ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFIT ON THE BASIS OF THE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. IF THEY ARE ABLE TO SO QUALIFY EVERY PROJECT WILL QUALIFY AND THERE WILL BE NO LIMIT ON DIRECT ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS IN THE PROGRAM. I HEARD MS CHEN TESTIFY TO YOU THAT THE BOARD WILL NOT DELIVER A DEFINITION. THAT RESULTS IN ALL PROJECTS QUALIFYING. THAT'S CLOSE TO SAYING THAT THAT THAT ARGUMENT ABOUT GREENHOUSE GASES WON'T BE ACCEPTED BUT IT'S STILL NOT STATED. AND YOU SHOULD JUST BE AWARE OF THAT BECAUSE AGAIN IF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS ARE A BASIS FOR PROVING THAT THE PROVISION GOES AWAY AND THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE LAW. SO THE FINAL ISSUE I WANT TO TALK ABOUT AND THIS IS WELL SPEND THE BULK OF MY TIME IS THIS QUESTION OF. OVER ALLOCATION AS IT'S PUT AN A. B. THREE NINETY EIGHT ALSO CALLED SOMETIMES OVERSUPPLY IN THE DISCUSSIONS. NICK THE FIRST THING TO SAY HERE IS IS THAT. UP CALIFORNIA IS NOT UNIQUE IN EXPERIENCING THIS PROBLEM AFFECT EVERY MAJOR CARBON MARKET IN THE WORLD HAS EXPERIENCED THIS EXACT SAME PHENOMENON. POSSIBLY BECAUSE MOST OF THESE CARBON MARKETS ROAD THROUGH THE RECESSION YOU DISCUSSED EARLIER WHICH EXOGENOUSLY CAUSED EMISSIONS TO FALL LOWER THAN WHEREVER THE PROGRAM CAPS WERE SET. PRIOR TO THE MISSIONS UP PRIOR TO THAT TO THE RECESSION. AND THE INTERESTING THING ABOUT CALIFORNIA'S THAT BOTH OF THE OTHER MAJOR MARKETS IN THE WORLD BOTH THE NORTHEASTERN STATES REGGIE CARBON MARKET AS WELL AS THE EUROPEAN UNION CARBON MARKET. HAVE BOTH IDENTIFIED THIS ISSUE STUDIED IT AND IMPLEMENTED PROGRAMMATIC REFORMS TO DEAL WITH THE PROBLEM OF CLOUDS OVER ALLOCATION. EITHER BY REMOVING ALLOWANCES UP FRONT OR IN THE CASE OF BOTH MARKETS ALSO REMOVING ALLOWANCES ON THE BASIS OF TRACK INFORMATION. AS THE BANK OF ALLOWANCES IN PRIVATE HANDS GROWS THE SUPPLY OF ALLOWANCES GOES UP OR DOWN DEPENDING ON THE AMOUNT OF THAT BANK. SO BOTH OF OUR OUR MOST IMPORTANT APPEAR SYSTEMS IN THE WORLD HAVE DEALT WITH THIS PROBLEM QUITE SUCCESSFULLY AND THERE'S NO TECHNICAL BARRIER TO DOING THAT HERE. I THINK THE MAIN BARRIER RELEASED TO HAVE AN HONEST CONVERSATION ABOUT THE NATURE OF THIS PROBLEM. AND WITH THAT I I I PROVIDED IN THE COMMITTEE. BACKGROUND DOCUMENT REFUSE TO REPORT THAT MY TEAM PUT OUT ON THIS ISSUE. AND MISS CHIANG TESTIFIED THIS MORNING THAT OUR REPORT IS INCORRECT. I WANT TO CLARIFY HOW THE THE EXCHANGE I JUST HAD WITH MISS CHIANG INFORMED WHAT I'M ABOUT TO TELL YOU. I THINK WHAT SHE'S TELLING YOU IS NOT ENTIRELY TRUE NICK IT'S TECHNICALLY TRUE. BUT IT DOESN'T ACTUALLY ADDRESS THE SUBSTANCE OF THE CONCERNS WE RAISED AND IF I COULD REFER YOU MISTER GARCIA TO THE BACKGROUND DOCUMENT OF THAT YOU HAVE THAT THE YOUR COMMITTEE PREPARED. IN TABLE ONE ON PAGE THREE. WALKS THROUGH SOME OF THE CALCULATIONS SIMILAR TO THE CALCULATIONS MY TEAMMATE NEAR ZERO PRESENTED. AND WHAT I HEARD MISS CHANG TESTIFY IS THAT THE PROGRAM CAPS IN THE CAP AND TRADE SYSTEM ARE SET USING FACILITY LEVEL DATA. AND THAT REFERS TO. A WHAT WOULD BE THE FOURTH LINE WHERE IT SAYS POST TWENTY TWENTY ALLOWANCES WITHOUT RESERVE. AND IN BOTH OF THE CASES IN THAT TABLE THE NUMBER TWO FIVE THREE TWO WAS IDENTIFIED THAT'S THE NUMBER OF ALLOWANCES THE BOARD PROJECTS IN THE POST TWENTY TWENTY PERIOD IN THE CURRENT MARKET RULES. MS CHANG TESTIFIED THAT THE NUMBER OF ALLOWANCES IS SET USING FACILITY LEVEL EMISSIONS DATA. THAT IS TRUE. THE ERROR WE IDENTIFIED HAS TO DO WITH THE FIRST LINE IN THAT TABLE. WHERE THE PROJECTED EMISSIONS IN THE POST TWENTY TWENTY PERIOD ARE BASED NOT ON FACILITY LEVEL EMISSIONS BUT ON THE EMISSIONS FROM THE ENTIRE SECTORS THAT ARE COVERED BY CAP AND TRADE WHICH INCLUDES A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF EMISSIONS THAT ARE NOT SUBJECT TO CAP AND TRADE? THIS ERROR REMAINS AN ERROR AND RESULTS IN THE PROBLEM WE IDENTIFIED IN OUR WORK THAT SHOWS THAT THE BOARDS ANALYSIS ABOUT OVER ALLOCATION DOESN'T HOLD ANY WATER. THAT CONTINUES TO BE TRUE. AND I CANNOT EMPHASIZE HOW MUCH OF THE BASIC SCIENTIFIC INTEGRITY QUESTION THIS'S WE WENT STRAIGHT TO THE MODEL OUTPUTS THAT THE BOARD SITES IN THE SCOPING PLAN. WE TRIPLE CHECKED THE NUMBERS THE NUMBERS MATCH WHAT ARE BE PUBLISHED AND THEY ARE NOT FACILITY LEVEL EMISSIONS DATA SO THE CALCULATIONS THE BOARD PRESENTS. ARE IN FACT BASED ON SECTOR WIDE EMISSIONS. THIS IS A PROBLEM BECAUSE THE CALCULATED REDUCTIONS IN THE BOARD'S REPORT ATTRIBUTED TO THE CAPITA RATE PROGRAM ARE INFLATED AS A RESULT OF THIS AIR. AGAIN THIS IS JUST BASIC ACCOUNTING. I WANNA EMPHASIZE FURTHER THAT THE QUESTION OF HOW TO DEAL WITH OVER ALLOCATION IS A QUESTION OF WHAT HAPPENS IN THE YEAR TWENTY THIRTY THE YEAR OF S. B. THIRTY TWOS BINDING STATEWIDE EMISSIONS LIMITS. AS LEN WHEN OTHERS HAVE TESTIFIED THE QUESTIONABLE REALLOCATION IS A QUESTION OF WHETHER OR NOT THESE EXTRA ALLOWANCES WILL CAUSE THE STATE TO MISSION MISS ITS EMISSIONS TARGETING TWENTY THIRTY. THE BOARD HAS NOT ANALYZE THE QUESTION OF WHAT OVER ALLOCATION MY TO TO EMISSIONS IN THE YEAR TWENTY THIRTY. THAT IS THE SINGLE AND PRIMARY QUESTION THAT IS STILL LEFT UNADDRESSED. THIS DISCUSSION IS CHIANG AND I HAD I'D BE DELIGHTED TO CONTINUE THAT DISCUSSION WITH YOUR PERMISSION. IS A QUESTION OF WHETHER OR NOT THE INFORMATION THE BOARD PUT FORWARD TO SATISFY AB THREE NINETY EIGHTS INSTRUCTION TO STUDY THIS ISSUE PASSES A BASIC SCIENTIFIC INTEGRITY TEST. IT DOES NOT IN MY OPINION. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. NEXT. PRESENT. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN GARCIA I'M MY NAME IS ANN CARLSON I AM A PROFESSOR OF LAW AT UCLA SCHOOL OF LAW WHERE I DIRECT THE M. INSTITUTE ON CLIMATE CHANGE IN THE ENVIRONMENT AND I'M ALSO ON THE INDEPENDENT. COMMISSIONS MARKET ADVISORY COMMITTEE. I SHOULD SAY HAS ALSO CALIFORNIA ASSEMBLY FELLOW IN NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO I SPENT FOUR YEARS WORKING IN SACRAMENTO SO IT'S. DEJA VU IN SOME RESPECTS ALTHOUGH I NEVER BEEN ON THE SIDE OF THE. OF THE MICROPHONE AS OF YOU FOR GIVING ME AN OPPORTUNITY TO. SHARE SOME THOUGHTS HERE I WANT TO START BY EMPHASIZING SOMETHING IMPORTANT ABOUT MYSELF AND THAT'S THAT I'M NOT ECONOMIST. AND I'M NOT A POSITION TO ANSWER THE KINDS OF QUESTIONS THAT I'M. PARTICLE WORD IS IS RAISING ABOUT FOR EXAMPLE THE ACCOUNTING PROCEDURES. A BUT I DO WANNA OTHER TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO THINK ABOUT THE ROLE THAT YOUR COMMITTEE. CAN PLAY AND PROVIDING OVERSIGHT OF THE CAR PROCESS I'M I SHOULD SAY THAT AS A SCHOLAR OF. I'M ADMINISTRATIVE AGENCIES EPA CAR BUT CETERA. THIS IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR ME TO THINK ABOUT THE APPROPRIATE ROLE THAT THE LEGISLATURE AUTOPLAY VIS A VIS AND ADMINISTRATIVE AGENCY. THAT IS DELEGATED THAT EXTRAORDINARY AMOUNT OF POWER AND AUTHORITY. BY THE LEGISLATURE WHICH I THINK IS PLACE A LOT OF TRUST IN CARP AT AND AT THE SAME TIME CONTINUING TO PLAY AN ONGOING ROLE THAT I THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT ONE AND SO. PART OF WHAT I WANNA DO IS JUST COME AND THAT THE. LEGISLATURE FOR ACTUALLY THINKING HARD ABOUT THAT APPROPRIATE BALANCE BETWEEN THE TWO AGENCIES AND THEN. SAY SOMETHING ABOUT THE WAY IN WHICH THIS COMMITTEE MIGHT THINK ABOUT THE OVER ALLOCATION PROBLEM FROM AN OVERSIGHT PERSPECTIVE AS OPPOSED TO REALLY TECHNICAL KIND OF ECONOMIC PERSPECTIVE. SO I'M SO THIS IS REALLY FOR FOR ME AND SINCE SOME RESPECT TO ADD EXERCISE AND FRAMING HOW TO THINK ABOUT THE ISSUE. BECAUSE AS. MS CHANG SAID I THINK APPROPRIATELY THIS IS A LONG TERM ISSUE WITH A LONG TAIL WHERE WE DON'T HAVE COMPLETE INFORMATION. AND MORE INFORMATION WILL COME GOING FORWARD AND ONE THING THE COMMITTEE MIGHT THINK ABOUT IS HAVE STRUCTURE SOME OF THE QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT KIND OF INFORMATION IS NECESSARY. AND I THINK THAT THINK ABOUT THAT IT IT MIGHT BE GOOD TO STEP BACK AND THINK ABOUT SOME FIRST PRINCIPLES. AND AT BY THAT WHAT I MEAN IS I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THINK ABOUT THE GOALS THAT. AB THIRTY TWO AND SB THIRTY TWO AND AND SO FORTH HAVE SET IN TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH. DEEP GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS AND THINK ABOUT WHETHER SOLUTIONS TO THE OVER ALLOCATION PROBLEM ARE CONSISTENT WITH THOSE SCHOOLS AND ALSO TO RECOGNIZE THAT THOSE SCHOOLS CAN BE ATTENTION WITH ONE ANOTHER. AND SO GETTING INFORMATION ABOUT WHETHER THOSE SCHOOLS ARE ACTUALLY GOING TO BE ACCOMPLISHED SEEMS TO ME TO BE AN IMPORTANT ROLE FOR YOUR COMMITTEE TO PLAY. SO LET ME JUST EXPLICATE SOME OF THOSE SCHOOLS PEOPLE MAY THINK THERE ARE OTHERS BUT ALL PUT A FEW IN FRONT OF YOU. AND THE TALK ABOUT THE WAYS IN WHICH THOSE SCHOOLS MIGHT ACTUALLY BE IN TOUCH WITH EACH OTHER AND THE KINDS OF QUESTIONS THAT YOU MIGHT ASK TO GET MORE INFORMATION. SO THAT YOU CAN PROVIDE APPROPRIATE GUIDANCE TO CARVE ABOUT WHICH SCHOOLS ARE MORE IMPORTANT HOW TO BALANCE THE COMPETING INTERESTS AND SO FORTH. SO IN MY VIEW M. AND THAT THE IT. A DECENT AMOUNT OF THIS FROM THE LEGISLATION LEGISLATIVE HISTORY. OF THE GOALS OF ANY SOLUTION TO THE OVER ALLOCATION PROBLEM THAT'S ASSUMING THERE ISN'T OVER ALLOCATION PROBLEM ASSUMING IT'S A SERIOUS ONE. SEEM TO ME TO BE M. MAYBE IN THIS ORDER ALTHOUGH YOU COULD QUIBBLE WITH MY ORDER FIRST TO ACHIEVE THE ENVIRONMENTAL OUTCOME AND THAT IS THE BINDING GOAL SET. FOR BY ON. LEGISLATION TO CUT GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS BY TWENTY THIRTY UP BY FORTY PERCENT OR NINETEEN NINETY LEVELS AND IMPORTANTLY ALSO TO THINK ABOUT WHETHER. AS MISS CHANG SUGGESTED THAT ALSO GETS US ON THE TRAJECTORY A TRAJECTORY THAT DOESN'T END IN TWENTY THIRTY BUT THAT ENDS MID CENTURY OR MAYBE NEVER ENDS. AND THAT IS uDEEPLY THE CALIFORNIA ECONOMY AND SO I THINK WE SHOULD KEEP. THAT LONGER TERM GOAL IN MIND AS WELL BECAUSE IT MAY BE THAT THE ANSWER TO THE QUESTION OF THE OVER ALLOCATION PROBLEM SHOULD TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE FACT THAT WERE LIKELY TO CONTINUE TO REGULATE POST TWENTY THIRTY. I'M SO ACHIEVING ENVIRONMENTAL OUTCOMES HE'S TO ME TO BE A. PRIMARY PRINCIPLE MAYBE THE MOST IMPORTANT GOAL BUT SIMILARLY IT'S VERY IMPORTANT DO SO COST EFFECTIVELY THAT'S. THAT'S OF REPLETE THROUGHOUT THE LEGISLATION IT'S ALSO SOMETHING I THINK KNOWN WOULD QUIBBLE WITH THAT WE WANT TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO THIS IN A WAY THAT. HELPS GROW THE ECONOMY THAT MAINTAINS PRICES FOR THINGS LIKE FUEL AND ELECTRICITY AT AND AT A RATE THAT CONSUMERS CAN AFFORD. WE WANT TO BE PARTICULARLY CONCERNED ABOUT DISTRIBUTIONAL CONSEQUENCES FROM LOW INCOME CONSUMERS WE SOMETIMES TALK ABOUT ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ON THE ENVIRONMENTAL SIDE I THINK IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO KEEP IN MIND THAT. THE ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES THAT HIGHER LEVELS PRICES FOR EXAMPLE COULD HAVE ON THINGS LIKE GASOLINE. I'M I THINK WE ALSO WANT. AND THIS IS PROBABLY A A LESSER GOAL BUT ONE THAT MIGHT BE WORTH KEEPING IN MIND. A PREDICTABLE RELIABLE REVENUE STREAM FROM THE. AUCTION OF ALLOWANCES I'M I KNOW THAT RAISING REVENUE IS NOT THE PRINCIPAL FOCUS OF THE. OF THE PROGRAM BUT IT IS HELPFUL TO HAVE STEADY OF BURKE PREDICTABLE REVENUE THAT HELPS BUDGET AND SO FORTH AND OF COURSE THAT REVENUE HAS PAID FOR SOME REALLY IMPORTANT. PROGRAMS AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO. SO WHY FORWARD MY PERSONAL FAVORITE IS CLEANING UP THE TRANSPORTATION FLEET WHICH I THINK ISTHE SINGLE BIGGEST PROBLEM FOR. FOR. DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND FOR AIR POLLUTION PROBLEMS THAT WE CONTINUE TO FACE. I THINK ANOTHER GOAL IS TO TRY TO MAKE TRANSITIONS FOR EXAMPLE INTO THE TWENTY TWENTY. PERIOD. STABLE AND TO LIMIT VOLATILITY AND AND PRICES THAT SUPPORT FOR CONSUMERS IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT FOR THE REGULATED PARTIES AND THAT FINALLY THIS MIGHT SEEM LIKE A WEIRD GOAL BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO KEEP IN MIND IS. THAT IT'S IMPORTANT TO MAINTAIN POLITICAL STABILITY FOR THE PROGRAM AND ONE OF THE GREAT HALLMARKS TO ME. OF CALIFORNIA'S CLIMATE POLICIES IS THAT WE HAVE MAINTAINED VERY STRONG PUBLIC SUPPORT FOR THE PROGRAM WE'VE MAINTAINED. A FAIR AMOUNT OF SUPPORT BY A LOT OF REGULATED PARTIES AND I THINK THAT'S IN PART BECAUSE WE'VE DONE A VERY GOOD JOB OF REDUCING EMISSIONS ARE COST EFFECTIVE PRICES. AND SO KEEPING THAT GOAL IN MIND WHEN WE THINK ABOUT. TRY TO SOLVE THE OVER ALLOCATION PROBLEM SEEMS TO ME TO BE IMPORTANT IT'S I JUST WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT THAT. THAT DIFFERENT SOLUTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN PROPOSED I DON'T I DON'T I THINK WE'RE PROBABLY NOT OF THE STAGE AT TO ACTUALLY FIGURE OUT WHAT THE RIGHT SOLUTION IS A BIG WE NEED MORE INFORMATION. BUT THE DIFFERENT SOLUTIONS COMPOSED REAL TENSIONS BETWEEN THOSE SCHOOLS SO FOR EXAMPLE IF WE WERE TO SAY LET'S DO NOTHING ABOUT THE OVER ALLOCATION PROBLEM ASSUMING THAT. IT EXISTS AND IT'S PRETTY SERIOUS WE COULD MISS THE TWENTY THIRTY GOAL BY TEN OR TWENTY OR EVEN THIRTY PERCENT TO SOME PROJECTIONS CHEST. BUT THE COSTS WOULD BE LOW. BY WAY OF HAVE MUCH LOWER COST BY THE SAME TOKEN IF WE SIMPLY CUT OFF A HUGE NUMBER OF. A PRE TWENTY TWENTY ALLOWANCES THAT BEEN BANKED AND SO FORTH WE MIGHT MEET THE ENVIRONMENTAL GOAL THAT WE MIGHT SEE PRICE SPIKES. AND AGAIN TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT. BY HOW MUCH IT CETERA SEEMS TO ME TO BE AN IMPORTANT GOAL FOR THIS COMMITTEE AND. A AND WOULD BE A GOOD WAY TO THINK ABOUT THE INTERACTIONS WITH CARBON SEEKING INFORMATION FROM CARP ABOUT. THE TRADE OFFS. BETWEEN THOSE TWO GOALS AND OF COURSE SOME OTHER ONES HOW VOLATILE PRICES BE IF WE AND ADOPT A PARTICULAR SOLUTION. ARE WE LIKELY TO USE LIVES POLITICAL SUPPORT ARE WE LIKELY TO SEE BIG PRICE SPIKES IN FUEL PRICES ARE ELECTRICITY AND SO FORTH. AND SO I'M SO FOR ME AND TRY TO EVALUATE THESE PROPOSALS I THINK OF BE HELPFUL TO GET MORE INFORMATION FRAMED AROUND THESE SCHOOLS AND AGAIN I THINK THAT MIGHT BE. A WAY FOR LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT TO PROCEED GOING FORWARD AS. CARD COMES OUT WITH A PROPOSAL IN IS VERY STAKEHOLDERS RESPOND TO THAT PROPOSAL. I'M. LET ME NOW JUST MOVE ON TO THE QUESTION OF DIRECT ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS I I AGREE WITH. OF DR COHN WORD THAT TIME. WE CANNOT MEASURE DIRECTIVE ARE NOT A BENEFIT SIMPLY BY SAYING THE REDUCE GREENHOUSE GASES I THINK THAT DEFEATS THE PURPOSE OF THE LEGISLATION. AND SO IT WOULD BE HELPFUL I THINK TO CLARIFY THAT PARTICULAR POINT. THE ONLY OTHER THING I'LL SAY IS I I THINK I'D BE REMISS AS A. LAW PROFESSOR IF I DIDN'T RAISE THE QUESTION OF WHETHER THEY'RE CONSTITUTIONAL PROBLEMS WITH. THE WAY THAT THE LEGISLATION READS RIGHT NOW I THINK THERE IT'S AT LEAST WORTH A DEEPER ANALYSIS OF WHETHER THEY'RE COMMERCE CAUSE PROBLEMS WITH SINGLING OUT CALIFORNIA TO HAVE DIRECT ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS THINK IT'S ACTUALLY COMPLICATED QUESTION. I THINK THE. NINTH CIRCUIT'S RULING ON THE LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD GIVES. SOME HOPE THAT THE LEGISLATION WOULD ACTUALLY BE OF HELP BUT I THINK PROBABLY DESERVES MORE ANALYSIS AND. HONEST IS WORTH SAVING. THANK YOU THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN RICH ROSS BROWN WITH THE LA THOUGH. I THINK I'D LIKE TO JUST BEGAN MY COMMENTS JUST. FIRST SORT OF STATING I THINK THAT GENERALLY OUR OFFICE HAS BEEN SUPPORTIVE OF CARBON PRICING AND CAP AND TRADE IN PARTICULAR AS A. TOOL TO ACHIEVE THE STATE'S AGGRESSIVE GREENHOUSE GAS TARGETS AND RECOMMENDED THE LEGISLATURE EXTENDED PROGRAM. LAST YEAR BECAUSE WE DO THINK IT'S THE ONE OF THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE TOOLS TO ACHIEVE THOSE GOALS IN THIS PARTICULAR IMPORTANT GIVEN THE AMBITION OF THE. OF THIS LEGISLATURE'S GOALS. HOWEVER IT IS AN EXTREMELY COMPLICATED PROGRAM AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO GETS. THE DESIGN FEATURES RIGHT AND BALANCE ALL THE DIFFERENT TRADE OFFS IN THOSE DESIGN FEATURES AND SO. WHAT WE THINK OVERSIGHT AND HEARINGS LIKE THIS ARE ARE IMPORTANT? FOR FROM THE LEGISLATURE'S PERSPECTIVE. ALSO JUST WENT OUT WE RELEASED GONNA A REPORT LAST DECEMBER HIGHLIGHTING SOME OVERSIGHT ISSUES AND. SOME OF THOSE ARE DISCUSSED AND AND THE HEARING STAY ON THE TOPIC OF OF THE HEARING TODAY WE ALSO PRODUCED A HAND OUT FOR TODAY'S HEARING WHICH YOU SHOULD HAVE. IN YOUR POCKET IF YOU DON'T THE SERGEANTS SERGEANTS CAN ARE. PRESENT THAT. I'LL JUST DISCUSS SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT WE HIGHLIGHT IN THE LAST FEW PAGES OF THOSE HAND OUT. THE FIRST TO THE ISSUE OF OVER ALLOCATION AND JUST MORE BROADLY SETTING CAPS AND OTHER SUPPLY OF ALLOWANCES. THE POST TWENTY TWENTY PROGRAM ARE OBVIOUSLY VERY A VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE FROM AN ENVIRONMENTAL PERSPECTIVE. AND. YOU JUST ASK THE QUESTION ARE CAPS THAT IN A WAY THAT'S CONSISTENT WITH THE LEGISLATURE'S TWENTY THIRTY GOAL IS THE PROGRAM GENERALLY SET UP IN A WAY. THAT'S LIKELY TO ACHIEVE THE LEGISLATURE'S GREENHOUSE GAS GOALS. IT'S PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT GIVEN THAT AND THE SCOPING PLAN CAP AND TRADE IS IDENTIFIED AS SORT OF THE TOOL THAT WILL ENSURE THE STATE MEETS THOSE GOALS. WHAT OTHER POLICIES ARE ABLE TO ACHIEVE CAP AND TRADE WILL MAKE UP THE DIFFERENCE SO IT'S PRETTY GOOD IMPORTANT TO DEMONSTRATE THAT IT'S ACTUALLY SET UP IN A WAY TO ACHIEVE THAT GOAL? AND ARE DECEMBER REPORT THAT I MENTIONED WE LAID OUT. ONE PLAUSIBLE SCENARIO WHERE JUST GIVEN THE STRUCTURE OF THE PROGRAM WITH BANKING AND POTENTIALLY WITH SOME UNUSED ALLOWANCES CARRIED OVER IN THE TWENTY TWENTY PROGRAM. YOU GET THE STATE DEFINED ITSELF IN A SITUATION WHERE IT MEETS THE SORT OF CUMULATIVE EMISSION REDUCTION OUR MISSION GOALS BUT DOESN'T NEED ITS ANNUAL TWENTY THIRTY TARGET THAT'S THE THAT'S LAID OUT IN STATUTE AND SO. I THINK THAT'S KIND OF IMPORTANT ISSUE TO EXAMINE US KIND OF IS THE IS THE PROGRAM GONNA GONNA PUT THE STATE ON TRACK TO ACHIEVE ITS ANNUAL TWENTY THIRTY GOAL. DESPITE THIS POSSIBILITY OUR CARBON ITS INITIAL WORKSHOPS HAS NOT IN OUR VIEW DEMONSTRATED OR EXPLAINS. HOW THE PROGRAM IS LIKELY TO ACHIEVE THAT TWENTY THIRTY GOAL AND PUT THE STATE ON TRACK TO ACHIEVE THAT TWENTY THIRTY TARGET? THEY HAVE DONE SOME ADDITIONAL ANALYSIS AT THE AS YOU'VE HEARD LOOKING AT. I ESTIMATED CUMULATIVE EMISSIONS AND KIM WOULD HAVE REDUCTIONS AND THERE'S SOME DISCUSSION THAT DR ARTICLE IN WORD MENTIONED. WE DO SHARE SORT OF SOME OF THE CONCERNS AROUND. THE ANALYSIS OF KEY MODE OF THE NATION'S INCOME HOW THAT THAT PROGRAM WOULD WOULD REDUCE THOSE. BUT DATE I THINK THE MORE IMPORTANT POINT IS THAT THERE IS STILL HAS NOT REALLY BEEN AN EXPLANATION OF EXACTLY. HOW THE BOARD ENVISIONS THE PROGRAM? AS GONNA PUT IN THE STATE ON TRACK TO ACHIEVE ITS TWENTY THIRTY GOALS. SO THEY THAT THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT WANT TO. DIRECTS A CARP TO REPORT ON HOW THE PROGRAM IS LIKELY TO DO THIS. EVALUATE AND THEN EVALUATE DIFFERENT BE A SIGNIFICANT ISSUE. AT THE VERY LEAST. I THINK SO ONE OF THE POINTS THAT WAS MADE EARLIER. BY MISS CARLSON. ESTABLISH SOME CRITERIA. AND AND SERVE DATA COLLECTION TO SORT OF OUTLINE IF NO ADJUSTMENTS ARE MADE NOW AT LEAST IN THE FUTURE WHAT ARE THE CRITERIA THEY'RE GOING TO BE USED TO EVALUATE. WHEN THIS IS A PROBLEM IF AND IF IT IS A PROBLEM WHAT ARE THE LIKELY STEPS THAT THE STATE'S GONNA TAKE TO TO ADDRESS IT. THEIR VARIETY OF OPTIONS THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS IN THE STATE HOUSE IN FRONT OF IT RIGHT NOW TO. DEAL WITH THE POTENTIAL OVER SUPPLY PROBLEM INCLUDING MOVING SOME ALLOWANCES EITHER TO THE PRICE CEILING OR MAYBE A MORE MODEST APPROACHES. MOVING SOME TO SOME OF THE. SPEED BUMPS AT SOME OF THE LOWER PRICES. THERE I THINK THE MAIN PUSHED BACK TO SOME OF THESE CHANGES. WHICH IS FAIR IS THAT IT IT NOW IT HAS. PUTS UPWARD PRESSURE PRESSURE ON PRICES AND COSTS. AND SO THERE IS DEFINITELY A VERY CLEAR TRADE OFTEN AND MAKING SOME OF THOSE ACTIONS AND MAKING SOME OF THOSE CHANGES. ARE BUT JUST A COUPLE POINTS ON THAT ONE. EVEN UNDER THE CURRENT PROGRAM UNDER KIND OF THE CURRENT CAPS MORE THAT'S OF SUPPLIED ALLOWANCES IT IS. THERE'S STILL A. SIGNIFICANT REST THE PRICES COULD INCREASE SIGNIFICANTLY EVEN CUT NOW IT SO THERE'S JUST A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY AROUND PRICES REGARDLESS OF WHAT ADJUSTMENTS MIGHT BE MADE. IN RESPONSE TO WHATEVER OVER SUPPLY ISSUE MIGHT BE OUT THERE. I THINK MAYBE THE MORE IMPORTANT POINT FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE IS THAT IT'S THE QUESTIONS AROUND STE SUPPLY OF ALLOWANCE IS AN OVERSUPPLY AND WHERE TO SET THE CAPS. ARE REALLY IN OUR VIEW SHOULD BE DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY THE IN THE STATE'S ENVIRONMENTAL GOALS AND WHETHER OR NOT IT'S CONSISTENT WITH THE STATE'S ENVIRONMENTAL GOALS. THEIR FAIR CONCERNS AROUND. COSTS AND TRADE OFFS RELATED TO COSTS HOWEVER THAT THE PROGRAM DOES HAVE OTHER FEATURES THAT ARE SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED TO TRY TO MITIGATE AGAINST SOME OF THOSE RISKS FOR EXAMPLE AB THREE NINETY EIGHT. DIRECTOR CARP TO ESTABLISH A PRICE CEILING AND THE GOLD THAT PRICE CEILING HAS TO DEAL WITH THAT THE THE SPECIFIC RISK OR CONCERNED ABOUT PRICES AND COST GETTING TOO HIGH AND SO. TO THE EXTENT THE LEGISLATURE IS CONCERNED ABOUT THAT AND YOU KNOW IT WENT TO I THINK LOOK VERY CLOSELY AT. OUR ENSURING CAR BESETTING THE LEVEL THAT PRICE HILL IN THE WAY THAT'S CONSISTENT WITH HOW THE LEGISLATURE BALANCES ITS GOALS ARE BETWEEN VARMINT GOALS AND ALSO. MAINTAINING COSTS AT A REASONABLE LEVEL. FINALLY JUST VERY QUICKLY ON THE OFFSETS ISSUE I DON'T KNOW THAT I HAVE MUCH TO ADD BEYOND WHAT HAS ALREADY BEEN SAID. OTHER THAN I THINK JUST ALSO THE HIGHLIGHTS. YOU KNOW THAT IT APPEARS BASED ON SOME STAFF COMMENTS IN WORKSHOPS THAT THERE WERE SOME CONSIDERATION OF ALLOWING A GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION. AS COUNTY NOW HAS A DIRECT ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFIT AYE I THINK YOU KNOW THAT THAT CLEARLY WOULD SORT OF FLATTENED MAKE OFFSET PROJECTS POTENTIALLY QUALIFY. AND THAT DOES SEEM TO BE INCONSISTENT IF IT WERE TO BE IMPLEMENTED THAT WAY THAT DOES SEEM TO BE INCOME AND WITH THE INTENT OF OF THE THE STATUTE ITSELF. I WANT MY COMMENTS THERE AND. HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT. THANK YOU. MY COLLEAGUE GUY CAN QUESTIONS. SURE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. CURIOUS ABOUT. SO LITTLE NO MORE DETAIL ON THE STATE OF THE MARKET ITSELF AND THE CARBON MARKET. I DON'T KNOW TO WHICH OF YOU THIS IS BEST DIRECTED BUT. LIQUIDITY BROUGH LIKE VOLUME A BILATERAL TRADING WHEN WE ACTUALLY SEEING IN THE CAR MARKET IS THIS IT. IS A ROBUST MARKETPLACE RIGHT NOW OUR DOES IT FEEL LIKE. STRICTLY A COMPLIANCE MARKET SORT OF WITHOUT I KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF FOLKS LOOKING CALIFORNIA'S WOULDN'T MAKE SOME INVESTMENT DETERMINATIONS AND. AND LOOK AT IT FROM A TRUE MARKET INVESTMENT PERSPECTIVE NOT NOT LIKE A REGULATE IT AND HE WOULD LOOK AT IT. WHAT ARE WE SEEING IN THAT LANDSCAPE HOW MANY NEW PLAYERS ARE ARE GETTING ENGAGED IN THAT CALIFORNIA CARBON MARKET IN? AND AND YOU KNOW SORT OF WHAT IS THE STATE OF. OF THAT SORT A SECONDARY MARKET LOOK LIKE RIGHT NOW YOU KNOW WE DON'T WE DIDN'T GET NEW INFORMATION TODAY ABOUT THE AUCTION I'M ASSUMING THAT CAN YESTERDAY SENATOR RIGHT SO SO DID WE DO WE HAVE. ANY AND I KNOW THAT'S THE THOSE OF THE COMPLIANCE ALLOWANCES BUT SURELY SECONDARILY MORE ACTIVITY. THREE IF YOU TAKE ON THAT. SO SO I THINK THE FIRST THING TO SAY SENATOR IS THAT THERE'S NO PUBLIC DATA ON SECONDARY MARKET BEHAVIOR AND THAT'S ALL THROUGH PRIVATE DATA SERVICES I DON'T HAVE DIRECT ACCESS TO ANY OF THAT RIGHT NOW. WHEN YOU READ SUMMARY REPORTS FROM THOSE INDIVIDUALS TRAINING SECTION AND QUITE THIN RECENTLY. I THINK TO YOUR QUESTION ABOUT WHO'S ENGAGING IN THE MARKET ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT. DATA POINTS TO GIVE YOU IS THAT A TYPICAL AUCTION INCLUDING THE MAY AUCTION THE RESULTS CAME OUT YESTERDAY. FEATURES AROUND NINETY FIVE PERCENT OF THE ALLOWANCES BEEN PURCHASED BY COMPLIANCE ENTITY WAS SO MOST OF THE PEOPLE BUYING MOSTLY LANCE'S ARE BEING BOUGHT BY ENTITIES THAT ARE SUBJECT TO THE PROGRAM. AND THERE'S A VERY SMALL AMOUNT THAT'S BEEN BOUGHT BY PEOPLE WHO ARE THIRD PARTIES THAT MIGHT BE PROVIDING LIQUIDITY OR OTHER SORTS OF FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS THAT YOU SEE IN TYPICAL MARKET PLACES SO IT'S. IT'S PRETTY WELL DOMINATED BY THE THE PURCHASING AND TRADING BEHAVIOR OF THE REGULATED ENTITIES RATHER THAN THIRD PARTY PARTICIPANTS. BUT THERE ARE OTHER BENEFITS TO MORE LIQUIDITY IN OUR MARKET AMEND KNOWING IN TYPICAL MARKETS YOU WANT. EASY ENTRY EXIT AND SORT OF LIKE. QUICK YOU KNOW A LOT BUT BROAD. AND DISTRIBUTION A RISK AMONG MORE PLAYERS BUT DO YOU THINK THERE'S A REASON THIS MARKET SHOULD BE DIFFERENT FOR. I THINK TO BE HONEST SENATOR MIGHT MY MY OWN PERSONAL VIEW IS THAT THERE'S A GREAT DEAL OF UNCERTAINTY RIGHT NOW BECAUSE THE AB THREE NINETY EIGHT PROCESS IS JUST BEGINNING WE'RE TALKING ABOUT FUNDAMENTAL QUESTIONS AS TO PROGRAM STRINGENCY. WHERE THINGS HAVE GONE VERY DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS AND IT'S A DIFFICULT TIME FOR THIRD PARTY INVESTORS TO ENGAGE WITH LONG TERM STRATEGIES? FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF ENTITIES THAT ARE SUBJECT TO THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM MY TEAM AND I BELIEVE WE CONTINUE TO SEE ALL THE ALLOWANCES BEEN PURCHASED AND THE SIZE OF THE PRIVATE BANK GROWING OVER TIME. WHICH SUGGESTS THAT AT LEAST IN THE NEAR TERM COMPLIANCE ENTITIES ARE SAYING WILL TAKE MORE ALLOWANCES NOW EVEN THOUGH WE DON'T NEED THEM RIGHT NOW. IS AGAIN EMISSIONS UNDER THE PROGRAM ARE SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THAN CURRENT CAP LEVELS GET ALL OF THE ALLOWANCES ARE BEING PURCHASED AND AGAIN THAT'S CONSISTENT WITH THIS NOTION THAT. PEOPLE ARE BANKING AND SAVING AT LEAST SOME. THERE'S A QUESTION OF HOW MANY THEY'LL SAVE OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS AND AS TO THE DISCUSSION EVERYONE'S BEEN HAVING WHAT THAT MEANS TO THE LONG TERM HEALTH OF THE PROGRAM. BUT IN THIS ENVIRONMENT WHERE THERE IS AT LEAST A SHORT TERM ACCESS THE THE ROLE FOR EXTRA LIQUIDITY IS IT DOESN'T STRIKE ME AS A FUNDAMENTAL CONSTRAINT BUT A HEALTHY MARKET WILL HAVE A VERY LIQUID MARKET ITS SO IT'S IRONIC THOUGH. THAT IN THE NEAR TERM WE HAVE ALL THE THERE'S DISCUSSION EXCESS AND AND AND NOT ALLOWED OUTSIDE ENTRANCE BUT THEN NO LONGER MEDIUM TERM. CONSERVE OUR PRICE SPIKES WERE YOU ACTUALLY COULD GET SOME BENEFITS THAT ENHANCE THE QUALITY SO HARD. WITH THAT BRIDGE LOOK LIKE AND. MEAN WHAT IT. SHOULD WE BE ENDEAVORING FOR THAT KIND OF MARKET IN CALIFORNIA IN YOUR VIEW DO WE WANT MORE THAN JUST COMPLIANCE ENTITIES IN OUR MARKETPLACE OR IS THERE ARE THERE OTHER UPSIDES TO THAT. IT FROM FROM A RECENT ALLEGATION PERSPECTIVE WARS THAT CHARTER RELEVANCE TO. IF THE SUN THE THE PRICE RISK SIDE IS THAT. NOT REALLY A FACTOR WE JUST THOUGHT ABOUT THAT. I MEAN I I'M NOT SURE I I GUESS THAT I HAVEN'T THOUGHT ABOUT THAT SPECIFIC QUESTION EXACTLY AND I GUESS THE WAY WE WOULD PROBABLY THINK ABOUT IT IS. I THOUGHT WHAT'S NECESSARY FOR KIND OF PRICES TO REFLECT THE KIND OF INCENTIVES THAT ARE NEEDED TO ENCOURAGE THE STATE TO MEET ITS GOALS SO IT YOU KNOW ARE. BASICALLY I I AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT FORM OF MARKET THAT TAKES NECESSARILY I MEAN I THINK THAT'S. I OFTENTIMES SORT OF SCENE OF ONE OF THE BENEFITS OF HAVING SORT OF THE ADDITIONAL PLAYERS IN THE MARKET IS THAT MAYBE IT COULD SORT OF HELP FACILITATE. SOME THE PRICE DISCOVERY IN THE PRICES MADE WHAT JUST BETTER REFLECT SORT OF THE THE VALUE GOING FORWARD IN THAT PROVIDES THE APPROPRIATE SENATE'S NEEDED TO ACHIEVE THAT THE GOALS THAT ARE SET OUT IN SO. WHY NOT THAT INCLUDES YOU KNOW A LOT MORE PLAYERS I I GUESS I DON'T REALLY KNOW EXACTLY BUT THAT'S I THINK OF HOW WE WOULD TEND TO THINK ABOUT IT? DID YOU GUYS GO THROUGH THE RESULT TILL THE OPTION NO THERE WAS NO CAN YOU GIVE US A LITTLE FEEDBACK WHAT WHAT WHAT DO WE SEE YESTERDAY WHAT WHAT WHAT CAME OUT. AND. YET. AT SO I MEAN I THINK JUST AT A HIGH LEVEL OF THE. CURRENT VINTAGES SOLD. THE STATE PORTION OF THAT IS ABOUT FORTY TWO MILLION ALLOWANCES YOU KNOW LITTLE LESS THAN HALF I THINK OF THAT FUTURE VINTAGES SOLD OUT TO TWENTY TWENTY ONE. IN THE CURRENT AUCTION INCLUDED BOTH TWENTY EIGHTEEN ALLOWANCES AS WELL AS SOME OF THE UNSOLD ALLOWANCES FROM TWENTY SIXTEEN THEY WERE BEING KINDA COMING BACK ONTO THE MARKET AND BEING RE OFFERED. THE PRICE OF THOSE SO CALLED DEAD CELL YEAH HOW. THE TWENTY SIXTEEN BIT INTO THE HAT THAT IF THE FUTURE VINTAGE WHICH IS WHAT TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY ONE AND BEYOND ONLY HAVE SO IT'S JUST TWENTY TWENTY ONE IN THIS AUCTION VERY DAY I ABOUT. ALMOST HOUSE SOLD AND HOW DOES THAT COMPARE TO LAST AUCTION. EVERYWHERE FOLKS BUYING THOSE LIGHT YOU'RE INTO SLIGHTLY LESS THAN THE LAST I MEAN THE LAST AUCTION WAS AT THAT THINK SORT OF YOU KNOW A LITTLE BIT MORE THAN HALF WITH MINORS THAT SEVENTY PERCENT AROUND THE NEIGHBORHOOD. SO SOME DROUGHT YET AND SO YOU KNOW PRICES CLEARED SO. TWELVE CENTS ABOVE THE FLOOR AND THE CURRENT AUCTION WE WHERE WHERE DID IT END WE'RE WEALTHY FOURTEEN SIXTY FIVE. FORCE FOURTEEN FIFTY THREE. NOT CURRENT AUCTION WAS WHAT'S OUT THE FLOOR. OTHERS ARE THE EVENTS ARE HAVING A BAD LUCK AND THANK YOU. I JUST HAD JUST VERY BRIEFLY ON THAT SENATOR THIS AGAIN THIS DISCUSSION THERE'S AT SOME DISCUSSION THAT THE AUCTION IS A SELF CORRECTING VEHICLE THAT REDUCES OVER ALLOCATION. AND AGAIN THAT THE NUMBERS JUST AREN'T THERE SO WAS DOCTOR BROWN TESTIFIED THE UNSOLD ALLOWANCES FROM THE TWENTY SIXTEEN AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN PRICE COLLAPSE ARE BEING REINTRODUCED. AND THEY'RE ALL BEING PURCHASED. THERE'LL BE A MODEST NUMBER THAT WON'T BE PURCHASED AND IT'S JUST NOT THAT BIG OF A DEAL IN TERMS OF THE OVER ALLOCATION CALCULATIONS PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT SORT WE SAW. IN THE RESULTS YESTERDAY WAS A RELATIVELY HEALTHY DEMAND PEOPLE BOUGHT ALL OF THE CURRENT YEAR ALLOWANCES THOSE ADVANCED ANNOUNCES THAT THEY DIDN'T PURCHASE DON'T GO AWAY THE BE MADE AVAILABLE IN THREE YEARS. SO DEMAND WEAKENED SLIGHTLY THERE BUT WE SAW THE MARKET BASICALLY ABSORB ALL OF THE SUPPLY. ACTUALLY. INCLUDING AGAIN THE PREVIOUSLY UNSOLD ALLOWANCES SO AGAIN THIS THIS BANK IS GROWING. NO LACK OF DEMAND. NO ACADEMIA I MEAN I CONFIDENCE AT LEAST IN THE MARKET IN THAT REGARD IT I MEAN. AND EH AT LEAST FROM THE COMPLIANCE ENTITIES A HEALTHY. THE MOTIVATION TO PARTICIPATE BUT YOU'RE SAYING YEAH WE JUST DON'T KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT. THE FUTURE TO KNOW BEYOND THIS IS KIND OF PERIOD WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN TO PRICES IN THE FUTURE I THINK THE WAY TO THINK ABOUT THIS IS THAT IF YOU HAVE THE OPTION TO BUY A TODAY'S LOW PRICES. AND TAKE A LITTLE BIT MORE THAN YOU NEED RIGHT NOW THAT LOOKS LIKE A BAT. ARE THAT YOU CAN PLACE IF THE MARKET TIGHTENS AGAIN MOST ANALYSTS THINK EVENTUALLY WILL TIGHTEN. WHETHER OR NOT IT GETS TIGHT BECAUSE WE DEAL WITH THE OVER ALLOCATION PROBLEM OR WE JUST WAIT. AND WAIT WAIT WAIT EVENTUALLY THE MARKET'S GONNA TIGHT SO THERE'S A KIND OF THAT ONE CAN PLACE. AND WITH PRICES WHERE THE ARMY ARE YOU SEEING ON THE OFFSET SIDE WHAT WHERE WE'RE PRICES THERE RIGHT NOW FOR. FOR COMPLIANCE OFFSETS THOSE ARE THOSE ARE NOT PUBLICLY TRACKED IN ANYWAY SO THOSE ARE BASICALLY PRIVATELY TRADED I DON'T HAVE ANY OF THE ACTION MEAN DID BILLION THOSE MARKET ANALYSTS OUT THERE I MEAN TODAY HAVE SORT OF ESTIMATED. PRICES IN VARIOUS INSTRUMENTS I MEAN DO WE ARE LACKING THAT DATA SHOULD WE BE. TAKING A CLOSER LOOK AT THAT AS I THINK IT'S INTERESTING THAT IF YOU COMPARE THIS TO FOR EXAMPLE THE LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD WHICH IS ACTUALLY SET UP LIKE AN EMISSIONS TRADING MARKET THERE'S A LOT OF TRADING ACTIVITY THAT'S PUBLICLY REPORTED BY THE BOARD. THERE'S NO SECONDARY MARKET DATA THAT'S REPORTED. THROUGH GOVERNMENT ENTITIES AND THAT'S NOT ON A FEDERAL LEVEL THAT'S NOT REQUIRED LIKE THROUGH THE CFTC OR SOME COME OUT IT YOU KNOW. I MEAN WE'RE LOOKING AT THIS FEDERALLY BUT THERE'S NO FROM SEC OR. CFTC PERSPECTIVE NO OBLIGATION FOR PUBLICLY TRADED COMPANIES DO THAT KIND OF COMMODITY FUTURES TRADING DISCLOSURE AYE MINIMUM AYE DEPTH HERE AGAIN I THOUGHT PART OF THE PART OF THE GOAL OF THIS PROGRAM WAS TO KEEP IT OUTSIDE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS OR WHAT BUT I DON'T. YEAH SO MY KNOWLEDGE THERE ARE NO REQUIRING IF THERE'S ANY CHECK ON THAT AT ALL. OKAY. LET'S REMIND MY MAIN QUESTIONS AT THIS POINT. RIGHT THANK YOU IDEA. IT'S SOMETHING A LITTLE OUTSIDE OF THE A BOXER YOUR. THE INTERESTS OF HANK KEEPING A CONSTRUCTIVE DISCUSSION GOING TO ACTUALLY. ASK ANYONE FROM THE AUDIENCE IF THEY HAD ANY QUESTIONS FOR. THE EARLIER PRESENTER AND SO I WOULD. IN THE INTERESTS OF. NOW FAIRNESS I WOULD ASK ANYONE WANTING TO ASK ANY OF THESE. PRISONERS ANY QUESTIONS TO SPEND ABOUT FIVE MINUTES. YEAH IF ANYONE WANTS TO US STEP FORWARD. AND DO SO. ALRIGHT THAT'S CREATIVE. YEAH NANO. CENA SCENE THAT NO ONE HAS ANY QUESTIONS FOR FOLKS APPEAR. AB ANY CLOSING COMMENTS OF FROM THE BALANCE HERE. I YES THANK YOU MISTER GARCIA ARE I THINK. I JUST ONE ECHO I THINK BOTH PROFESSOR CARLSON A DOCTOR BROWN TALKED ABOUT TRADE OFFS IN THE PROGRAM AND I WANNA CALL IT IS AN ECONOMIST INSERTED REQUIRED TO TELL YOU THERE ARE TRADE OFFS. BUT ONE TRADE OFF I THINK WE REALLY NEED TO TALK ABOUT MUCH MORE CLEARLY AND THAT IS WE'RE DOING THIS WHOLE PROCESS IN REVERSE WE'RE DOING THIS IN BACKWARDS ORDER. SO THE SCOPING PLAN PACKET HAVE AFTER ALL THAT THE BIG HEAVY LIFT TO PASS AB THREE NINETY EIGHT HAPPENS LAST YEAR IN JULY THE SCOPING PLANK IT'S FINALIZED NOVEMBER DECEMBER. THE SCOPING PLAN SAYS FORTY SEVEN PERCENT. A THE MISSION REDUCTIONS IN TWENTY THIRTY ARE GONNA COME FROM CAP AND TRADE. NOW WE'RE DESIGNING A REGULATION THERE IS NO ANALYSIS EITHER IN THE SCOPING PLAN OR IN THE INFORMAL PART THE REGULATORY PROCESS THAT HAS THUS FAR OCCURRED. THAT CONNECTS HOW THE MARKET DESIGN SELECTED BY THE BOARD WILL ACHIEVE ANYTHING RESEMBLING THAT LEVEL OF AMBITION. NOW MAYBE WE CAN HAVE A GOOD FUND TECHNICAL DEBATE ABOUT THIS BUT THERE'S LITERALLY NO ANALYSIS OR INFORMATION. AND THAT IS A STRIKING THING TO SAY ABOUT THE MOST PROMINENT CARBON MARKET IN THE WORLD. AND THE LAST THING I THINK I WANNA SAY ABOUT THIS IS IS AGAIN TO ADMIT PROFESSOR KRAUSS ANYTHING MADE A VERY GOOD POINT WHICH IS. IT MAY BE THAT RESOLVING OVER ALLOCATION WILL INCREASE MARKET PRICES. DOCTOR BROWN POINTS OUT THAT AGAIN THERE ARE PRICE CONTROL MECHANISMS THAT THE BOARD CAN IMPLEMENT TO CONTROL THOSE PRICES WERE THE BOARD DEEMS FIT TO BALANCE ALL THOSE INTERESTS. BUT THE BOARD DESIGNS A PROGRAM THAT DOESN'T DELIVER ON THE ENVIRONMENTAL GOALS THERE'S A CONSISTENCY PROBLEM WITH RESPECT TO THE BALANCE BETWEEN CAP AND TRADE AND REGULATIONS IN THE SCALP IMPLANT WAS APPROVED LAST YEAR. SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU A I GUESS THE ONLY THING I WOULD ADD IS THAT. TO STATE THE OBVIOUS US IS EXTRAORDINARILY COMPLEX AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I DO THINK IT'S WORTH POINTING OUT IS THAT. WE HAD A LOT OF SUCCESS TO DATE AND. OR IN AN ENVIABLE POSITION AND A LOT OF RESPECTS AND THAT. EMISSIONS HAVE DECLINED AT A RATE FASTER THAN WHAT WE EXPECTED PRICES HAVE STAYED LOW AND THE AMOUNTS MARKETS WHICH HAS. BENEFITS AND THAT OUR COMMODITY PRICES ARE NOT ROTH OF RAPIDLY RISING OUR ECONOMY HAS GROWN. AND SO YOU KNOW. THAT WE SHOULD TAKE SOME COMFORT IN THE FACT THAT IN THE FIRST. SIX YEARS OF THE PROGRAM WE'VE SEEN EXTRAORDINARY SUCCESSES AND I THINK YOU KNOW THE JOB OF THIS COMMITTEE AGAIN AS TO. TO MAKE SURE THAT CARP CONTINUES ON PACE TWO AND TO AND PROVIDE THE KIND OF INFORMATION NECESSARY TO ALLOW. THE KINDS OF ASSESSMENTS THAT I THINK THEY'RE GOING ON BY THIRD PARTIES RIGHT NOW IN A WAY THAT I THINK IS HEALTHY AND CONSTRUCTIVE AND SO. PART OF IT AGAIN WHAT I WANT TO EMPHASIZE IS JUST TO COMMAND THE PROCESS WHICH I THINK IS AN IMPORTANT ONE WE SOMETIMES THINK MORE ABOUT THE SUBSYSTEM LEAD ABOUT THE PROCESS. BUT FOR ME AS SOMEBODY WHO THINKS A LOT ABOUT PROCESS. I THINK THAT THIS IS AN EXTRAORDINARY PROCESS TO HAVE VERY CLEAR DIALOGUE BEFORE SOME OF THESE PROBLEMS MIGHT ACTUALLY OCCUR. AND TO BE AND TO HAVE YOU KNOW I'D APPRECIATE FOR EXAMPLE ALLOWING PEOPLE TO ASK QUESTIONS OF THE WITNESSES. NOT JUST THOSE SENATORS AND ASSEMBLY MEMBERS HERE AND SO I WOULD JUST ENCOURAGE YOU TO CONTINUE THIS BACK AND FORTH PROCESS WHERE. WE GET AS MUCH INFORMATION ON THE TABLE AS WE CAN WE GET AS MUCH ANALYSIS WE CAN NOT JUST FROM CAR BUT FROM. OUTSIDE PARTIES LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE AND SO FORTH SO. SO THANK YOU FOR THAT. JUST WHAT IT WILL LOOK EXCUSE ME WILL THAT CONTINUE TO MONITOR IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROGRAM AND WERE ALWAYS HERE TO PROVIDE ASSISTANCE TO THE COMMITTEE WHENEVER NEEDED. THANK YOU. I DON'T HAVE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. MY COLLEAGUE NO QUESTIONS I WANNA THANK YOU UP WITH A R. B.. AND THREE PANELISTS WHO HAVE PRESENTED WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE. THE OVERSIGHT OF OF THESE POLICIES TO ENSURE THAT THE INTENT OF THE LEGISLATION THAT HAVE BEEN PASSED ARE HONORED AND. THAT THE OUTCOMES ARE BEING MET THAT THAT WE'RE STRIVING FOR SO. ANTICIPATE THAT I ANTICIPATE ADDITIONAL CONVERSATIONS WHETHER THEY BE FORMALLY. SUCH AS A HEARING OR AS WELL AS AN OF THE COMPETITIONS O. CONTINUE TO HAPPEN. IN OUR OFFICES AND WITH THEY ARE BE. WILL OPEN IT UP FOR PUBLIC COMMENT AT THIS TIME ANYONE WISHING TO ADDRESS THE COMMITTEE. PLEASE COME FORWARD. STATE YOUR NAME ORGANIZATION. YOUR COMMENTS. THANK YOU GET TO THE PALACE. THAT SERGEANT PATTY WITH THE AMERICAN GOVERNMENT SHOULD THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HOLDING THIS HEARING ALSO CAN ALL DIVE INTO THESE IMPORTANT ISSUES. THERE'S BEEN SOME DISCUSSION HERE ABOUT AND THE DIRECT MENTAL BENEFITS IN STATE DADS AND AND WHAT THE INTENT OF THAT ISN'T. YOU KNOW WHEN WHEN ONE READS THAT LEGISLATION. AND IN THEIR IN THEIR SOME WHO BELIEVE THAT THAT THAT MEANS IN STATE CAN GET. YOU KNOW IT'S LEGISLATORS WHAT SAID MET IN STATE. YOU SAID THAT. CAN WRITTEN IN THE LAW. THAT SHOULD BE FOUR PERCENT IN STATE. THE FIRST FIVE YEARS THE NEXT I COULDN'T AND SIX AND STATE PHONE WITHIN FIVE YEARS. BUT I DON'T THE DOES NOT TO HIS SON'S TOUCH TALK ABOUT RECOMMENDING BENEFIT SO WE HAD TRIP TRUST. THAT LANGUAGE WAS INTENTIONAL THAT THEY ONLY WANTED. CARD TO EXERCISE THEIR OVERSIGHT. TO ENSURE THAT. THE ASA FOR PROVIDING SOME ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFIT TO CALIFORNIA. IN FACT THEY WENT SO FAR AS TO SAY. ANY AIR POLLUTANT THAT STRONG LANGUAGE I CLEARLY INCLUDES GHGS. AS THE EPA. HAS AFFIRMED THAT GHGS OUR AIR POLLUTANTS AND. SUPREME COURT HAS. AFFIRMED THEIR AUTHORITY TO MAKE THAT DETERMINATION. BUT RESPECT WATER. THERE'S BEEN NO QUALIFICATION THAT THERE WERE THERE WERE EVEN TALKING ABOUT WATER BALLOONS. WE CAN TALK ABOUT AIR POLLUTANTS AS WITH RESPECT THEIR THEIR IMPACT ON WATER AS WELL SHEETS CHEESE. SO. SO TRUSTING THAT. THEM. IF CARBON THEIR PROFESSIONAL EXPERTISE TREMENS THAT. ANY GHC REDUCTION ANYWHERE PROVIDES A DIRECT ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFIT. TO CALIFORNIA. THEN. THE INTENT OF THE LAW. HAS BEEN MET AND AND WE SHOULD ALL BE SATISFIED THAT AND AND LASTLY JUST TO TO TO ON RESPOND TO US UNDERSTANDS QUESTION REGARDING. AT PRICES. WE HAVE ENOUGH. INSIGHT INTO THOSE PRICES FOR ME TO BE ABLE TO RESPOND TO THAT. THOSE THOSE GENERALLY. THEY SENT ME THE PROGRAM THEY HAVE ALWAYS TRACKED. ALLOW ITS PRICES WITHIN A CERTAIN BAND WE CAN SAY THERE WITHIN. SAY FIFTEEN PERCENT BELOW ON THE ALLOWANCE PRICES SO CAN SAY MAYBE. MAYBE TWO DOLLARS RIGHT NOW BELOW ALLOWANCE PRICES AND SO THAT'S A CLEAR INDICATION. THAT. THE MARKET CONTINUES TO BE. CONSTRAINT RESPECT TO. OFFSET SUPPLY. IF THERE WERE ACCESS OUTSIDE SOME OUTSIDE SUPPLY YOU WOULD SEE A DIVERGENCE IN THOSE PRICES WHERE OFFSETS PLACES WOULD PRICES WOULD. WOULD TAKE A DIFFERENT TRACK DOWNWARDS. AND WOULDN'T JUST TRACK RIGHT BEHIND ON THE LEVELS PRICES SO THERE'S CLEARLY A NEED. FOR FOR OFFSETS IN THE MARKET THANKS VERY MUCH. I. MCHALE'S WHO ARE LOW ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA COUNCIL FOR BY MY COUNT MOUNTS. LIKE TO PICK A THANK COMMITTEE FOR HOSTING ANOTHER ON THESE OVERSIGHT HEARINGS. AND WE THINK IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT. THE CAP AND TRADE IS NOT THE SOLE COSTA CARBON AND CALIFORNIA'S MARKET. WE HAVE A NUMBER OF PROGRAMS THAT THAT ALL COME AT ADDITIONAL COSTS A CAP AND TRADE IS DESIGNED TO BE THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE AND. ECONOMICALLY EFFICIENT WAY TO ACHIEVE REDUCTIONS AS SUCH IT IT DOES HAVE A MUCH LOWER COST A CAR BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE L. CFS MARKET OR THE RENEWABLE PORTFOLIO STANDARD. ALL THOSE COMMENTED ADDITIONAL COSTS MUCH HIGHER THAN THAN WHAT THE CAP AND TRADE IS ON THE SCALE OF OF TWO THREES SOMETIMES TEN TIMES MORE. AND AND WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT THAT THIS PROGRAM WAS BUILT AS THE COST RELIEF VALVE FOR THE ENTIRETY OF S. B. THIRTY TWO ONE AB THIRTY TWO BEFORE. AND AND TO THAT END AIR BE DID DESIGNED THIS PROGRAM AND AND I THINK IT WAS NEGOTIATED BY STAKEHOLDERS TO KEEP THE COSTS LOW. AND SMOOTH THINGS OVER THE COURSE OF OF THE COMPLIANCE PERIODS WHICH IS WHY WE HAVE A THREE YEAR COMPLIANCE TERMS AS OPPOSED TO SINGLE YOUR CENTER ENTERS. Y. WE LOOK AT THIS OVER A PERIOD OF A DECADE AS OPPOSED TO A PERIOD OF. OF YOU KNOW IMMEDIATE. NOW IN AND OUT YEARS. TO THAT END THERE ARE MECHANISMS DESIGNED TO DEAL WITH THINGS SUCH AS YOU KNOW. MOVING ALLOWANCES ARE OUT FROM FROM THE MARKET SHOULD THEY GO ON AUCTION AFTER A CERTAIN. PERIOD OF TIME. AND I THINK THE YOU KNOW WE CAN'T INTERCHANGEABLY SAY OVER ALLOCATION WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO TALK ABOUT SUPPLY. YOU KNOW OUR OUR ALLOCATIONS WERE BASED ON. FACILITY DATA UNLIKE. YOU KNOW WE THIS IS NOT COMPARABLE TO REGGIE OR THE UNITY ES WHERE THERE. BUT THEY'RE NOT A MISSION ALLOCATIONS WERE BASED ON CAPACITY. SO IF I HAD A HUNDRED MEGAWATT PLANT BUT AS ONLY RUNNING AT A SEVENTY SEVENTY FIVE. YOU AYE I WAS BEATEN GIVEN CREDIT FOR THE HUNDRED. IN CALIFORNIA YOU'RE ONLY GIVEN CREDIT FOR FOR WHAT YOU'RE PUTTING OUT. AND THAT'S WHERE THE BENCHMARKING TOOK PLACE BACK IN BACK IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT TWO THOUSAND NINE ONE WE'RE DEVELOPING THIS PROGRAM. SO IT IS NOT AN APPLE STORE YOU KNOW IT'S NOT APPLES TO APPLES COMPARISON WE TALK ALLOCATIONS. SO YEAH I DO THINK THE TERM OVER ALLOCATION IS AN APPROPRIATE USE WEEK WE CAN TALK ABOUT SUPPLY WE CAN TALK ABOUT. POTENTIAL OVERSUPPLY BUT TO TALK ABOUT OVER ALLOCATION I THINK THAT'S A COMPLETE MISNOMER IT RELATES BACK TO THE TO THE CRISIS THAT THAT TOOK PLACE IN THE EU'S PROGRAM. AND IT INVOKES THAT KIND OF FEAR WE SHOULD HAVE THAT KIND OF FEAR AS WE MOVE FORWARD WE WE WE DESIGNED FOR THAT. THAT WHAT THAT WAS DEALT WITH THAT THERE'S AND TO SAY THAT THERE IS NO ANALYSIS PEACE BETWEEN THE SCOPING PLAN AND THE INTERACTION THE CAPTURE IS ALSO FALSE WE HAVE TEN YEARS. OF OF REGULATORY DEVELOPMENT WE HAVE INPUT FROM FROM SO MANY STAKEHOLDERS A IT IT'S JUST IT'S THAT'S GOING TOO FAR IT'S A STEP TOO FAR IN THE DESCRIPTION OF HOW THIS WENT WEEK WE'VE ALL BEEN. PARTICIPATING IN THIS REGULATORY AND LEGISLATIVE DEVELOPMENT FOR OVER A DECADE AT THIS POINT. IT'S THEIR THEIR IN THE RECORD IS BUILT. IS GONNA CONTINUE TO BE BUILT AS WE MOVE FORWARD I THINK IS IMPORTANT AT THESE DISCUSSIONS IN HERE FROM. FROM FOLKS LIKE LIKE NEAR ZERO WHO HAVE THESE CONCERNS THAT WE CAN TALK ABOUT POTENTIAL CONCERNS THERE BUT IT TO DESCRIBE IT IS OVER ALLOCATION OR TALKING ABOUT SUPPLY I THINK IS INCORRECT. AND I THINK WE ALSO HAVE TO TAKE TAKE THEIR RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE END. AND AND BASED ON KIND OF HOW WE'RE LOOKING AT IT IF IF WE REMOVE THIS MANY ALLOWANCES NOW IS BEING SUGGESTED BY SOME. WE END UP WAY BEYOND THE FORTY PERCENT BELOW. NINETEEN NINETY LEVELS IN TWENTY THIRTY AND AND. WE DON'T HAVE LEGISLATIVE MANDATE FOR THAT AND I DON'T THINK THE LEGISLATURE WANTS TO TO START LOOKING AT THAT. UNTIL WE'VE WE'VE STARTED MOVE INTO THAT POST TWENTY TWENTY PERIOD AND WERE LOOKING DOWN THE ROAD FURTHER WE SEE THE ECONOMICS OF HOW THAT'S GOING TO GO. SO WE DID WHAT WILL FOLLOW UP WITH SOME ADDITIONAL COMMENTS WERE GONNA TAKE SOME TIME TO DIGEST. ALL THE COMMITTEES STUFF THAT WAS PRESENTED HERE TODAY BUT WE THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO LOOK AT THESE THINGS THROUGH THROUGH THE EYES OF. OF YOU KNOW PERHAPS IT AT SOME POINT THE COMMITTEE WANTS TO HEAR A LITTLE BIT MORE INPUT ON PANEL SOME PEOPLE HAVE TO COMPLY WITH THESE REGULATIONS. I THINK WE HAVE AN IMPORTANT VOICE IN THIS AS WELL SO THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN GARCIA VICE CHAIRMAN STERN THANK FOR HOLDING THIS HEARING TODAY. BILL MCGAVIN WITH COALITION FOR CLEAN AIR WE WORK ON RESTORING CLEAN AIR FOR CALIFORNIANS AND ALSO ON PREVENTING CLIMATE CHANGE. WE REALLY APPRECIATE THAT OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS THE LEGISLATURE UNDER YOUR LEADERSHIP CHAIRMAN GARCIA. HAS BASICALLY TRIED TO MOVE CALIFORNIA'S CLIMATE PROGRAMS TO WHERE THEY WOULD ALSO. PROVIDE BENEFITS PARTICLE IMPROVING AIR QUALITY FOR CALIFORNIANS. MOST OF WHOM AS YOU KNOW ARE STILL. SUFFERING FROM AIR THAT IS NOT HEALTHY TO BREEZE. AND SO I THINK WE NEED TO USE THAT LANCE WHEN WE LOOK AT. DIRECT ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS AND ALSO DIRECT EMISSION REDUCTIONS UNDER AB ONE NINETY SEVEN SOMETHING I DON'T THINK IT'S BEEN. DISCUSSED YET THIS MORNING BUT BUT SHALL I WANT TO ADDRESS. SO WE THINK AT AND WE BELIEVE THAT THE LEGISLATURE. ARE HAS INTENDED. THAT WHEN WE LOOK AT OFFSETS. THAT THEY SHOULD BE PROVIDING BENEFITS TO CALIFORNIA COMMUNITIES. DIRECT ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS. AND THAT THOSE IF WE'RE GOING TO HAVE OFFSETS IN THE PROGRAM THAT THAT'S WHAT WE WANT TO PROVIDE THAT THOSE SHOULD ACTUALLY BE NOT ONLY REDUCING GREENHOUSE GASES BUT PROVIDING THOSE OTHER DIRECT ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS TO OUR COMMUNITIES. AND THEN WE LOOK AT AB ONE NINETY SEVEN. I WAS SUGGESTS THAT THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD CLARIFY THAT DIRECT EMISSION REDUCTIONS MEAN THOSE EMISSION REDUCTIONS THAT ARE ACHIEVED BY REGULATED ENTITIES. ONSITE RATHER THAN OUTSOURCED THROUGH ALLOWANCES AND OFFSETS. THANK YOU. YOU. I THINK MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBER OF THE COMMITTEE. MICHAEL SOCK CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURES TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION I WANTED TO ASSOCIATE MANY MY COMMENTS WITH A MISTRESS CARLA FROM CIBER EARLIER. AND SNOW THAT REMOVING ALLOWANCES YOU KNOW FROM THE MARKET AT THIS POINT WE KNOW WILL INCREASE THE PRICE. OF THOSE AMOUNTS IS WHICH DRIVES OF THE COMPLIANCE COSTS WHICH HAS A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE MANUFACTURING ENVIRONMENT CALIFORNIA. IN TERMS OF THOSE COSTS SO WE DO KNOW THAT THEIR SIGNIFICANT YOU KNOW ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES OF SOME OF THESE ACTIONS WE ALSO KNOW THAT LOOKING OUT. THAT THERE ARE. EXECUTE IF THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT TIGHTENING. OF THIS SITUATION WE GET TO THE MID TWENTY TWENTIES ROUGHLY. A WIN THOSE ALLOWANCES WILL BE NECESSARY SO REMOVING THEM FROM THE MARKET NOW ARTIFICIALLY DRIVES UP PRICES TODAY. PUTS US IN A NEGATIVE POSITION. FOR THE FUTURE SO WE WOULD BE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE PROSPECT OF REMOVING AT ANY ALLOWANCES THAT ARE CURRENTLY UNUSED. FROM THE MARKET NOT FOR THAT PURPOSE OF FOR FOR THOSE REASONS ADDITIONALLY. WE AND WE THINK THAT THE MARKET THE WAY IT IS WORKING TODAY AS IS INDICATED BY THE A RESULTS ARE RELEASED YESTERDAY. IS THAT THE CORE OF THE CURRENT VINTAGE AMOUNTS IS BEING COMPLETELY SOLD OUT AND. I THINK THE FUTURE VINTAGE ALLOWANCES WERE NOT ENTIRELY SOLD OUT THAT THEY'RE STILL STRONG LEVEL OF INTEREST IN THAT. BEING THOSE AT THE MANY OF THOSE WERE. ACQUIRED BY COMPLIANCE ENTITIES YOU KNOW ISN'T THAT THE PURPOSE OF THE SYSTEM ISN'T THE PURPOSE THAT THESE ALLOWANCES ARE AVAILABLE FOR ENTITIES THAT HAVE A COMPLIANCE OVULATION. THE FACT THAT THERE ARE INVESTMENT ENTITIES AND OTHER ENTITIES PARTICIPATING IN THE MARKET. CAN ASSIST WITH VOTE LIQUIDITY. AND FACILITATING NOT HOWEVER THE PURPOSES ON THE COMPLIANCE SIDE FOR BT FACTORING INTO HE OTHERS WHO HAVE THAT OBLIGATION SO. ODD GIVEN THAT THAT'S THE CASE GIVEN THAT ARE WHAT WE KNOW WHAT HAPPENED REMOVED THOSE ALLOWANCES WITH WE HAVE CONCERNS. THAT TAKING SUCH ACTION OR DIRECTING YOUR BE A STATE TO TAKE SUCH ACTION. YOU KNOW WOULD HAVE SIGNIFICANT ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES FOR THOSE COMPANIES THAT FALL UNDER THAT AND THEN FROM THAT WOULD BE. CONCEPT FURTHER CONSEQUENCES TO THE ECONOMY. THROUGH THE PRODUCTS THAT WE PURCHASE FUEL ELECTRICITY ETCETERA. THANK YOU IF YOU. GOOD MORNING I'M CAITLIN REDNER SUTTER FROM THE ENVIRONMENTAL DEFENSE FUND AND THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE SOME REALLY BRIEF COMMENTS AND. ESPECIALLY FOR FACILITATING THIS ONGOING CONVERSATION. FROM ETFS PERSPECTIVE IT IS GOOD NEWSTHAT CALIFORNIA IS BELOW OUR EMISSIONS LIMIT AND AHEAD OF SCHEDULE TO MEET OUR TWENTY TWENTY TARGET. THIS IS GOOD FOR THE ENVIRONMENT IT DEMONSTRATES THE SUCCESS OF CALIFORNIA'S SUITE OF CLIMATE POLICIES INCLUDING THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM. AT THE SAME TIME BEING BELOW THE CAP PRESENTS AN OPPORTUNITY TO INCREASE THE STATE'S AMBITION POSTS TWENTY TWENTY BY SETTING A MORE STRINGENT CAP ON EMISSIONS. AND SPECIFICALLY SETTING THAT CAP BEAST ON EXPECTED EMISSIONS AS WAS DONE BACK IN TWENTY TEN RATHER THAN CONTINUING JUST A STRAIGHT LINE CAP FROM TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY THIRTY. WE THINK INCREASING THIS CLIMATE AMBITION IS REALLY IMPORTANT NOT ONLY TO MEET OUR TWENTY THIRTY TARGET BUT ALSO TO CONTINUE CALIFORNIA'S ROLE AS AS A REALLY IMPRESSIVE CLIMATE LEADER. AND I ALSO REALLY QUICKLY WANT TO MAKE A POINT ABOUT AND ONE BENEFIT OF LIMITED ALLOWANCE BANKING. AND THAT IS THE ABILITY TO DRIVE EARLY EMISSION REDUCTIONS WHICH IS OF COURSE GOOD FOR THE CLIMATE. EVERY ALLOWANCE THAT THAT IS NOT USED RIGHT NOW THAT IS HELD RIGHT NOW IS REPRESENTS A TON OF EMISSIONS. IS NOT LIMITED RIGHT NOW WHICH HAS I MEAN GOOD CUMULATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS. SO I JUST WANTED SHARE THAT POINT FROM FROM ETFS PERSPECTIVE THAT THERE IS AN ENVIRONMENTAL. ASPECT TO BANKING TO CONSIDER AS WELL. AND SO AGAIN THANK YOU FOR THIS DISCUSSION M. FOR THE OPPORTUNITY AND PUSH IT. HELLO GOOD MORNING JOHN CONSTANTINE ON BEHALF OF THE VERIFIED EMISSION REDUCTIONS ASSOCIATIONS A GROUP OF OFFSET DEVELOPERS. WANT TO JUST BRING UP A COUPLE OF POINTS ON. ARJUN WAS CORRECT THAT. AIR POLLUTION. INCLUDES GHGS BY DEFINITION IMPLY A STATUTE SO I. THE ARGUMENT THAT. OFFSET CAN'T PRODUCE AND DIRECT MY OWN BENEFIT HAS SOME SERIOUS ISSUES BECAUSE AN OFFSET BY DEFINITION IS A REAL REDUCTION PERMANENT FORCIBLE QUANTIFIABLE. AND. THEY THE THE BENEFITS OF THE OFFSET THEMSELVES. CAN'T BE THE. I'M SORRY. WHEN YOU START OR. YALE UNIVERSITY TO STUDY. AND THEY LOOK AT WHAT AN ASSET IS AND CAN YOU GET. ALL THESE EXTRAS ONTO AN OFFSET AND OFFSET IS A GHG REDUCTION OUTSIDE THE CAP SECTOR AT A COST IT'S BELOW. MARKET VALUE THERE'S A LOT OF VALUE THERE FOR THE PROGRAM FOR AND HE'S AND FOR THE. THE. GREATER NON REGULATORY ENTITY TO GET. GHG REDUCTIONS AND THEY DETERMINED THAT IF YOU IF YOU CHRISTMAS TREE OFFSETS IN ADD ON DIRECT VIA A YET ON. NOT LIKE SOCKS. HEALTH BENEFITS YET ON ALL THESE OTHER NON GHG PIECES TO OFFSET IT NO LONGER BECOMES WHAT IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE IT BECOMES A MORE EXPENSIVE. PRODUCTION MEASURE AND SO NOT SAID IS WHAT IT IS AND THE REQUIREMENTS OF THREE NINETY EIGHT DESCRIBE. BENEFITS THAT ARE VERY BROAD AND. THE GROUP HAS HAS. COMMENTED ACCORDINGLY SO I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT THAT OFFICE IT IS WHAT IT IS WHICH IS A GHG REDUCTION AND. ADDING ALL THESE OTHER THINGS MAKE IT A MORE EXPENSIVE OTHER KIND OF THING AND THAT'S NOT WHAT THE WAY THE PROGRAM WAS SET UP. IF YOU. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE WISHING TO ADDRESS THE COMMITTEE. ALRIGHT BECAUSE COMETS. ALRIGHT BUT LET ME JUST SAY AGAIN THANK YOU FOR. THIS CONVERSATION IT'S BEEN. I THINK A GOOD PRODUCTIVE. DESTRUCTIVE ONE AND I LOOK FORWARD TO OUR NEXT YEAR AND WHAT WE CAN HAVE. SOME OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE TO IMPLEMENT YOU KNOW THESE POLICIES AT TO HEAR DIRECTLY FROM THEM BUT. I I DO WANT TO JUST SAY THAT. YOU KNOW WE RECOGNIZE THAT. THE OFFSETS ARE. IMPORTANT WHEN WE HAVE. DEPLOY THESE A ACROSS THE BOARD. OUT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT. OFFSETS AND IN THE END LEGISLATIVE INTENT HERE IN THE DIRECT INVOLVEMENT OF BENEFITS. YOU KNOW THE THOUGHT. IT HAS BEEN HOW DO WE ENSURE THAT YOU KNOW WHERE DRESSING. I HAD THE LOCAL PROBLEMS CLEAN AIR. A CLEAN WATER. AND DOUG IT CLEARLY AS ONE OF THE AUTHORS OF THE BILL I I CAN APPRECIATE YOU KNOW THE. RE ITERATION OF WHAT THE INTENT OF THE LEGISLATION WAS MY WAS SPEAKERS BUT DOUBT YOU KNOW FOR US. IT WAS THAT DRAFTED IN CRAFTED PACIFIC LEE THIS WAY. TO MEET THE. RESTRICTIONS OR LIMITATIONS OF. OF THE LAW. THAT THAT COULD ALLOW WAS TO MEET THESE OVERALL OBJECTIVES AND SO I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT I. AT RESTATED THAT THAT THE BERMAN OF DRUG DIRECTLY IN AT BENEFITS. THAT WAS THE APPROPRIATE APPROACH AND I AS THE AUTHOR THE BILL I WANT TO LET YOU KNOW THAT THAT'S WHAT WE MEANT. I AND NOTHING BEYOND THAT SO. THANK YOU AGAIN FOR PARTICIPATING IN TODAY'S HEARING I LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING THE DIALOGUE THERE MANY DETAILS STILL. TO BE. SCOTT'S AND THAT MAKE SURE THAT THAT THE OVERALL GOALS AND OBJECTIVES ARE MET NESTLED THANK YOU AGAIN THAT THIS MEANS OBJECT
