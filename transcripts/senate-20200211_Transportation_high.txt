IMPROVING STATE OF GOOD REPAIR. MAXIMIZE EFFICIENCIES. DELIVERING ALL THE PROMISES OF SB ONE. AS YOU KNOW THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED BUDGET INCLUDES INVESTMENTS IN TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE AS WELL AS EFFORTS TO COMBAT CLIMATE CHANGE. THE BUDGET INCLUDES FIVE POINT FOUR BILLION IN VOTER APPROVED SB ONE FUNDS. DIVIDED BETWEEN STATE AND LOCAL INVESTMENTS IN THE FOLLOWING MANNER. THREE POINT FIVE BILLION FOR EXISTING INVESTMENT AND ROAD REPAIR REHABILITATION AND MAINTENANCE AND ONE POINT NINE BILLION FOR TRANSIT RAIL. TRADE CORRIDOR ENHANCEMENTS CONGESTION SOLUTIONS ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION AND OTHER PROJECTS. THE SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES HAVE FOR THE NEARLY EIGHT THOUSAND PROJECTS STATEWIDE AND CREATED THOUSANDS OF NEW JOBS. ALSO 60% OF CARPENTRY PROCEEDS ONE POINT FOUR BILLION ARE COMMITTED TO HIGH SPEED RAIL TRANSIT AND INTERCITY RAIL LOW CARBON TRANSIT OPERATIONS AND SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES. TRANSPORTATION INVESTMENT IS CRITICAL TO ACHIEVING MANY THE PRIORITIES REFLECTED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDING MAINTAINING INFRASTRUCTURE CLIMATE RESILIENCY CREATING JOBS. CONSTRUCTING ECONOMY AND ADDRESSING HOMELESSNESS. BUT LET ME BE CLEAR. SB ONE FUNDS ARE PROTECTED AND LOCKED IN. WE ARE HONORING THE WILL OF THE VOTERS AND THESE FUNDS ARE BEING USED FOR THEIR INTENDED PURPOSE. WITH THE AVAILABLE FUNDING CALTRANS EXPECTS THAT THE OVERALL CONDITION OF PRIMARY ASSET CLASSES CLASSES PAVEMENT BRIDGES CULVERTS AND TRANSPORTATION MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS. WILL IMPROVE OVER THE NEXT TEN YEARS. WITH ADDITIONAL FUNDING FROM SB ONE ANNUAL FUNDING RELATIVE TO NEED HAS MORE THAN DOUBLED. MINUTES PROGRAMS FOCUSED ON PAVEMENT BRIDGES AND TUNNELS DRAINAGE SYSTEMS AND TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM MANAGEMENT SYSTEM PROJECTS OUR WILL RESOURCE. MISTER CHAIRMAN I FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT CALTRANS IS ON TRACK TO MEET SB ONE TARGETS BY TWENTY TWENTY SEVEN. THIS INCLUDES 90% OF PAVEMENT AND GOOD OR FAIR ONDITION. 90% OF CULVERTS IN GOOD FOR CONDITION. MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS IN GOOD CONDITION. AND FIXING AN ADDITIONAL FIVE HUNDRED BRIDGES. DURING THE FIRST TWO YEARS OF SB ONE FROM AUGUST TWNTY SEVENTEEN TILL DECEMBER TWENTY NINETEEN. APPROXIMATELY FOUR POINT FOUR BILLIONHAS BEEN ALLOCATED STATEWIDE FROM THE MANY PROGRAMS CREATED BY SB ONE. THESE DOLLARS HAVE FUNDED OR EXPENDED ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED FIFTY NINE CAPITAL AND MAINTENANCE PROJECTS- LED BY CALTRANS AND WE ANTICIPATE BE FUNDED. IN VARIOUS PHASES THIS YEAR. ALSO I'D LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT SB ONE HAS MADE A MEANINGFUL IMPACT ON TRANSIT. AND RAIL PROJECTS STATEWIDE WITH A LONG TERM COMMITMENT A FUNDING FROM THE TRANSIT AND INNER CITY CAPITAL PROGRAM. OTHERWISE KNOWN AS T. I. R. C. P. IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE TRANSPORTATION AGENCY AWARDED FOUR POINT THREE BILLION. TO PROJECTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. FUNDED BY BOTH SP ONE. AND THE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUND. THE PROGRAM HAS MADE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN TRANSFORMATIVE TRANSIT AND REAL PROJECTS ALL OVER CALIFORNIA. IN THE BAY AREA THESE INCLUDE THE BAR EXTENSION TO SAN JOSE CALTRAIN ELECTRIFICATION AND FLEET EXPANSION AND EXPANSION OF SMART TO LARKSPUR IN WINTER. WE'VE ALSO INVESTED IN ZERO MISSION BUS SERVICE BETWEEN SACRAMENTO AND READING. EXPANSION OF STOCK OR TEA LIGHT RAIL SERVICE TO FOLSOM. VALLEY REAL INVESTMENT IN PEACE AND THE AMTRAK SN WALKING REAL SERVICE. AND ZERO EMISSION BUSES IN FRESNO ANTELOPE VALLEY AND SANTA BARBARA. IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WE MADE KEY INVESTMENTS IN THE ORANGE COUNTY STREET CAR THE REDLANDS RAIL PROJECT. LA METRO LA DASH METROLINK AND LOS AND SERVICE EXPANSION AND THE SAN DIEGO TROLLEY AND BUS SYSTEM. AND NOW IN TWENTY TWENTY WE ARE PREPARED TO MAKE A NEW ROUND OF T. I. R. C. P. PROJECT WORKS BY APRIL FIRST. ADDING NEW PROJECTS TO THE FIVE POINT THREE BILLION THAT HAS ALREADY BEEN AWARDED. OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS. SB ONE FUNDING HAS ALLOWED THE STATE TO EXPAND ITS PARTNERSHIPS WITH LOCAL AGENCIES. IN THE VETTING THESE CRITICAL TRANSIT. AND REAL PROJECTS ALL OVER CALIFORNIA. BUT ALSO LIKE TO BRIEFLY TOUCH UPON THE GOVERNOR'S CLIMATE CHANGE EXECUTIVE ORDER IN NINETEEN NINETEEN WHICH WAS UNVEILED THIS PAST SEPTEMBER. FIRST LET'S START WITH THE BIG PICTURE. THE EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE ARE ALL AROUND US WE ARE SEEING IT DAILY. EXTREME WEATHER PATTERNS MORE WILD FIRES INCLUDING JUST RECENTLY MORE FLOODING MORE INTENSE HEAT AND COLD. THIS IS GOING TO REQUIRE CHANGES IN TERMS OF HOW WE LIVE OUR LIVES AND WE NEED TO KEEP AN EYE ON WHAT IT WILL TAKE TO MITIGATE CLIMATE CHANGE. AND ADAPT TO IT. BECAUSE IF WE FAIL TO TAKE STEPS NOW. FUTURE GENERATIONS OUR KIDS AND GRANDKIDS. WILL PAY THE PRICE. ALSO YOU KNOW THE DATA POINT. 40%OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS COME FROM THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR. SO ALL OF US WHO WORK IN TRANSPORTATION. HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY. TO BE PART SOLUTION. BUT HAVING SAID THAT. I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT MAINTAINING THE CONDITION OF OUR HIGHWAYS ROADS AND BRIDGES IS OF THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE TO GOVERNOR SOME. AN EXECUTIVE ORDER DOES NOT CHANGE YOUR EMPHASIS ON FIX IT FIRST. THAT WILL CONTINUE. THE EXECUTIVE ORDER ALSO DOES NOT SUPERSEDE STATE LAW. NOR DOES IT SUPERSEDE ARTICLE NINETEEN OF THE CONSTITUTION. SB ONE FUNDS ARE PROTECTED IN LOCKED IN. AND WE ARE HONORING THE WILL OF THE VOTERS THESE FUNDS ARE BEING USED FOR THEIR INTENDED PURPOSE. WHILE PRIORITIZING FIX IT FIRST WE ALSO NEED TO LOOK FOR OPPORTUNITIES TO DELIVER PROJECTS THAT HELP. TACKLE CONGESTION BY ENCOURAGING MORE WALKING. BIKING AND TRANSIT USE. WE WILL ALSO CONSIDER PROJECTS THAT SUPPORT SUSTAINABLE FREE AND PROMOTE GREATER ADOPTION OF ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES. AND WE ALSO NEED TO LOOK AT PROJECTS THAT MAKE OUR INFRASTRUCTURE MORE RESILIENT TO THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE. ALL THESE PROJECTS ARE CURRENTLY ELIGIBLE WITHIN THE VARIOUS SB ONE PROGRAMS. WERE TAKING A STRATEGIC APPROACH TO ENSURE THAT OUR PLANNING. PROGRAMMING AND PROJECT DELIVERY FUNCTIONS INCLUDE SCOPING FUNDING AND BUILDING PROJECTS THAT WILL MEET THE STATE'S AMBITIOUS CLIMATE GOALS. AS WELL AS SB ONCE FIXIT FIRST PERFORMANCE TARGETS FOR PAVEMENT. BRIDGES DRAINAGE AND TRANSPORTATION MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS. I ALSO WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT THE EXECUTIVE ORDER IS THE BEGINNING OF THE CONVERSATION NOT THE END. SO IN TERMS OF NEXT STEPS MY AGENCY WILL DEVELOP AN IMPLEMENTATION ACTION PLAN AND IT WILL BE INFORMED BY INPUT AND COLLABORATION FROM THE PUBLIC. AND MEMBERS A LEGISLATURE ALL OF YOU. THIS WILL BE DONE IN CLOSE PARTNERSHIP WITH A BROAD ARRAY OF TRANSPORTATION STAKEHOLDERS. AND SO AS WE EMBARK ON THIS EFFORT WE WILL KEEP YOU AND YOUR STAFF INFORMED OF NEW DEVELOPMENTS. IN THE WEEKS AND MONTHS AHEAD. MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO APPEAR BEFORE YOU TODAY. CALTRANS DIRECTOR TALKS ON SHARK IN WILSHIRE REVIEW MORE DETAILS. ON HOW THE DEPARTMENT IS IMPLEMENTING SB ONE PROGRAMS. REALIZING EFFICIENCIES. ENGAGING SMALL AND DISADVANTAGED BUSINESSES THANKS TO THE CONCERT WILL AUGMENTATION. IN STATE TRANSPORTATION FUNDING FROM SB ONE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SECRETARY- TOOK SOME SHOCKING INNER ARE CALTRANS DIRECTOR OF THE FLOOR. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN. AND SENATORS. MY NAME IS TALK SO MUCH SHOCK IN DIRECTOR OF CALTRANS. I'M PLEASED TO BE HERE TODAY TO PRESENT OUR PROGRESS THANKS TO THE PASSAGE OF SB ONE. SB ONE AUGMENTS THE STATE'S TRANSPORTATION FUNDING PROVIDING ABOUT FIVE POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY BETWEEN STATE AND LOCAL INVESTMENTS. SINCE THE PASSAGE OF SB ONE CALTRANS AND OUR PARTNERS HAVE COMPLETED THREE HUNDRED AND FORTY TWO PROJECTS. AND WE HAVE EIGHT HUNDRED AND FORTY EIGHT MORE PROJECTS IN THE WORKS ON A HIGHWAY MAINTENANCE AND COMPETITIVE GRANT PROGRAMS. WE CONTINUE TO PRIORITIZE OUR FOUR CORE ASSETS. PAVEMENT BRIDGES COVERTS AND DRAINAGE SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGY THAT KEEPS TRAFFIC SYSTEM FLOWING. CALTRANS CONTINUES TO INCORPORATE COMPLETE STREETS ELEMENTS WERE COST EFFECTIVE AND APPROPRIATE AND CLIMATE RESIDENT RESILIENCY FEATURES INTO OUR PROJECTS CONSISTENT WITH THE GUARANTEES OF ARTICLE NINETEEN OF THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION. THE FUNDING WILL CONTINUE TO BE SPENT EXACTLY US ATTENDED BY SB ONE AN ARTICLE NINETEEN. OUR FIX IT FIRST APPROACH MUST CONTINUE. THIS IS THE THIRD YEAR OF SB ONE AND WE'RE ENTERING A NEW PHASE WHERE MOVING MORE PROJECTS FOR TO CONSTRUCTION AND SEEN GREATER PROGRESS THIS YEAR. I AM PLEASED TO TELL YOU. THAT ALL A PROPOSED TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY STATE HIGHWAY OPERATIONS IN PROTECTION PROGRAM ALSO KNOWN AS THE SHOP. REPRESENTS THE SINGLE LARGEST YEAR FUNDING THAT WE'VE SEEN IN RECENT HISTORY THANKS TO SB ONE. OUR MOST RECENT PERFORMANCE BENCHMARK REPORT SHOWS THAT CALTRANS IS ON TRACK TO EXCEED SB ONE PERFORMANCE TARGETS BY TWENTY TWENTY SEVEN FOR PAVEMENT BRIDGES AND CULVERTS. AS OF JUNE TWENTY NINETEEN WE HAVE COMPLETED MORE PROJECTS REHABILITATING MORE THAN THIRTY EIGHT HUNDRED LANE MILES OF PAVEMENT AND FIXING MORE THAN NINETEEN OF FIXING THE PROBLEM. APPROXIMATELY NINETEEN BRIDGES. IN THE COMING STATE HOW WE OPERATIONS AND PROTECTION PROGRAM CALTRANS WILL FIX AN ADDITIONAL. FIFTY FIVE HUNDRED LANE MILES OF PAVEMENT TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY BRIDGES. FOUR THOUSAND. RATED SYSTEMS AND MORE THAN THIRTY FOUR HUNDRED CONGESTION REDUCING TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT ELEMENTS. LET ME JUST HIGHLIGHT SOME OF THE PROJECTS THIS FUNDING IS NOW MAKING POSSIBLE. SB ONE IS CONTRIBUTING TO PAVEMENT REHABILITATION PROJECTS ACROSS THE STATE INCLUDING. TO PAY MY PROJECTS WITH A TOTAL OF EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS ON HOW WE SEVENTEEN IN SANTA CLARA COUNTY. THREE PROJECTS TOTALLING ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTEEN MILLION DOLLARS ON INTERSTATE FIFTEEN IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY. EIGHT ONE HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE BILLION DOLLAR PROJECT ON HOW WE SIXTY IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY. TWO PROJECTS TOTALING SIXTY NINE MILLION ON INTERSTATE EIGHTY IN ALAMEDA COUNTY. A SEVENTY FOUR MILLION DOLLAR PROJECT ON INTERSTATE SIX OH FIVE IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY. AND SB ONES ARE ALSO GOING TO THREE BRIDGE MAINTENANCE PROJECTS WITH A TOTAL WITH A TOTAL OF THIRTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS ON HOW WE TWENTY NINES IN NAPA COUNTY. SB ONE IS ALSO FORMING PART OF A ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY ONE MILLION DOLLAR BRIDGE AND PAVEMENT MAINTENANCE PROJECT ON HOW WE WANT TO ONE. IN HUMBOLDT COUNTY. SB ONE FUNDS ARE ALSO CONTRIBUTING TO A THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR PROJECT FOUR EIGHT MILE CARPOOL LANE OR NOT BECAUSE CORD- ON INTERSTATE FIVE IN SAN DIEGO. I COULD O ON. BUT I THINK YOU GET A SENSE OF THE CONTRIBUTIONS THAT SB ONE IS MAKING ACROSS OUR STATE. NOW TO EFFICIENCIES SB ONE ALSO REQUIRES THE CALTRANS IDENTIFY AND IMPLEMENT EFFICIENCIES WITH THE LOOK WITH THE GOAL OF GENERATING AT LEAST ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN SAVINGS EACH YEAR. FOR THE SECOND YEAR IN A ROW CALTRANS WAS ABLE TO EXCEED DISCO SAVING MORE THAN DOUBLE THE ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR MARK IN THE LAST FISCAL YEAR. THE SAVINGS ALLOW FOR ADDITIONAL REPAIR AND MAINTENANCE OF A HIGHWAYS AND BRIDGES ACROSS THE STATE. TO ACHIEVE THESE EFFICIENCIES CALTRANS IS FOCUSED ON THREE AREAS PROCESS IMPROVEMENT NEW TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATIVE TOOLS. WE APPRECIATE THE OPTIONS THAT THIS LEGISLATURE'S TAKEN TO GIVE US THESE EFFICIENCIES. CALTRANS WAS THE FOR STATE DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION IN THE COUNTRY. TO BE A SIGN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT RESPONSIBILITY TO REVIEW PROJECTS UNDER NEPA OR NATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY ACT WE RECOGNIZE THE SUPPORT THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS PROVIDED TO PERMANENTLY EXTEND THE AUTHORITY THAT WAS GIVEN TO US. THIS ASSIGNMENT OF AUTHORITY HAS ACHIEVED SIGNIFICANT TIME SAVINGS BY ALLOWING CALTRANS TO COMPLETE ENVIRONMENTAL DOCUMENTS MORE THAN A YEAR EARLIER ON AVERAGE. SHORTENING THE TIME THAT ALLOWS FOR CONSTRUCTION TO BEGIN AND REDUCING CONSTRUCTION CALLS ULTIMATELY OVERALL. CALTRANS HAS ALSO BEEN PILOTING AN INNOVATIVE METHOD METHOD OF PROJECT DELIVERY KNOWN AS CONSTRUCTION MANAGER GENERAL CONTRACTOR ALSO KNOWN AS C. M. G. C. THIS CONTRACTING TWO ALLOWS CALTRANS TO HIRE A CONTRACTOR DURING THE DESIGN PROCESS PROVIDING VALUABLE INPUT THAT CAN REDUCE COSTS. AND CHANGE ORDERS AND BETTER MANAGE RISK THAT WE MAY HAVE. LAST YEAR THE LEGISLATURE RECOGNIZED THE POTENTIAL OF THIS TOO AND PROVIDED CALTRANS WITH PERMANENT CNG C. AUTHORITY. THIS METHOD ALLOWS CALTRANS TO THIS METHOD ALLOWED CALTRANS TO SAY MORE THAN FOURTEEN MILLION DOLLARS ON TWO PROJECTS JUST LAST YEAR. SB ONE ALSO CREATED THE INNOVATIVE ADVANCE MITIGATION PROGRAM WHAT FOUR YEARS OF INITIAL FUNDING THAT WILL AMOUNT TO A HUNDRED AND TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS AND A REVOLVING ACCOUNT BY TWENTY TWENTY ONE THIS PROGRAM IS A NEW TYPE OF BUSINESS PRACTICE DOUBT THAT WILL FUND THE CREATION AND PURCHASE OF MITIGATION CREDITS TO BE USED ON TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS. THE PROJECTS WILL REIMBURSE THE ADVANCED MEDICATION ACCOUNT FOR THE USE OF CREDITS CREATING A MORE SUSTAINABLE FUNDING LOOP FOR ADVANCED MEDICATION ACTIVITIES. WE RELEASED GUIDELINES FOR THE PROGRAM LAST YEAR AND ON SCHEDULE TO FUND THE FIRST PROJECTS IN THIS PROGRAM AND A PROGRAM THIS SUMMER. THE NEW PROGRAM IS MODELED ON A PILOT CONDUCTED IN THE SHOP THAT HAS ALREADY BENEFITING SB ONE PROJECTS. CALTRANS AND THE CALIFORNIA STATE TRANSPORTATION AGENCY ARE ALSO PART OF AB TWELVE EIGHTY TWO PERMITTING TASK FORCE WHICH IS EVALUATING WAYS TO STREAMLINE PERMITTING IN COLLABORATION WITH RESOURCE AGENCIES ACROSS THE STATE. THE STREAMLINED PERMITTING IS EXPECTED TO BENEFIT OUR ABILITY TO PROVIDE ENVIRONMENTAL MITIGATION FOR TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS. THIS TASK FORCE WERE RELEASED A REPORT SOON OUTLINING OUR STRATEGIES ON THE WAY TO CREATE PERMITTING EFFICIENCIES AND OUR AND OUR RECOMMENDATIONS ON HOW THE FORD ADVANCE THIS EFFORT. ON THE RESEARCH FRONT CALTRANS IS WORKING TO DEVELOP TEST AND EVALUATE TRANSPORTATION INNOVATIONS THAT WILL ENABLE THE STATE TO IN A IMPROVE IN MANY IN MANY AREAS FOR EXAMPLE CALTRANS PAVEMENT RESEARCH PROGRAM IS WORKING ON NEW AND INNOVATIVE WAYS TO INCORPORATE RECYCLED MATERIAL AND TO PAVEMENT AND TO DEVELOP LONG LASTING PAYMENT SOLUTIONS THAT A KID CAN ACHIEVE IGNIFICANT COST SAVINGS AND ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS. NOT TO SMALL BUSINESS AND DISADVANTAGED BUSINESS CONTRACTING. CALTRANS ALSO CONTINUES TO ADVANCE OUR EFFORTS TO ENGAGE SMALL BUSINESSES DISADVANTAGED BUSINESSES INCLUDING VETERAN WOMEN AND MINORITY OWNED FIRMS TO REACH DIVERSE BUSINESSES THAT HAVE NEVER CONTRACTED WITH CALTRANS. DURING THE LAST FISCAL YEAR CALTRANS WAS CALTRANS AWARDED MORE THAN ONE BILLION DOLLARS TO SMALL BUSINESSES DISABLED VETERAN BUSINESSES AND PRIZES AND DISADVANTAGED BUSINESS ENTERPRISES. CALTRANS SMALL BUSINESS CONTRACTING IS EXPANDING I ALMOST DOUBLE THE RATE OF OUR OVERALL CONTRACT. WE EXPECT TO SEE THE FULL IMPACT OF SB ONE AND RELATED INCREASES FOR SMALL BUSINESS CONTRACTING BY TWENTY TWENTY TWO. TO ACHIEVE THIS GROW. WE HAVE PUT ON OVER THREE HUNDRED EVENTS IN THE LAST TWO YEARS TO REACH SMALL BUSINESSES AND DIVERSE GROUPS TO ENCOURAGE PARTICIPATION AND CALTRANS CONTRACTS ARE REGIONAL SMALL BUSINESS COUNCIL CONTINUES TO ENGAGE WITH ETHNIC SPECIFIC CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE THROUGHOUT THE STATE TO PROVIDE NETWORKING AND TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES. TO SMALL BUSINESS. CALTRANS HAS ALSO BEEN WORKING TO INFORM AND EDUCATE SMALL BUSINESSES INCLUDING VETERAN WOMEN OR MINORITY OWNED FIRMS THROUGH ONE HUNDRED TARGETED ADVERTISEMENTS AND DOZENS OF PUBLICATIONS. WOULD COMBINE WEEKLY READERSHIP OF MORE THAN ONE MILLION PEOPLE. THESE EFFORTS ARE BRINGING THE POSITIVE IMPACTS OF SB ONE AND STATE CONTRACTING TO MORE CALIFORNIANS THAN EVER BEFORE. AND WE CONTINUE TO EXPAND OPPORTUNITIES TO WORK WITH CALTRANS. I AM ALSO PROUD TO REPORT THAT WE HAVE RE BRANDED OUR OFFICE OF BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY AS THE OFFICE OF CIVIL RIGHTS. THIS RETURN THREE OFFICES ORIGINAL NAME RECOGNIZES CALTRANS COMMITMENT TO ADVANCE IN EQUITY AND CONTRACTED. WE RECOGNIZE THAT SB ONE OFFERS GREAT OPPORTUNITIES TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS VETERANS WOMEN AND OTHER MINORITY GROUPS WHO'VE HISTORICALLY FACED DISADVANTAGES. IN CLOSING I WOULD LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR INVESTMENT THE LEGISLATURE HAS MADE ON SB ONE THROUGH SB ONE. TO ACHIEVE THE VISION OF SB ONE AND MY OVERALL GOAL FOR CALTRANS WE HAVE IDENTIFIED FIVE PRIORITIES THAT WE WILL BE WORKING ON MOVING FORWARD. SAFETY ENGAGEMENT. EFFICIENCIES MULTIMODALITY AND INNOVATION. MY NUMBER ONE PRIORITY IS SAFETY AND THAT'S THE NUMBER ONE PRIORITY FOR THE DEPARTMENT AS WELL WE NEED A TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM THAT IS SAFE FOR ALL USERS. AND OUR WORKERS WOULD INCREASE INVESTMENTS FROM SB ONE WERE INVESTING IN MORSE SAFETY IMPROVEMENTS WHILE ALSO DOUBLING THE NUMBER OF HOW WE WORK CELLS. SO IT'S IMPORTANT IT'S MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER TO BE WORKS ON ALERT. CALTRANS SO. UP CALTRANS MUST ALSO WORK TO BUILD BETTER PARTNERSHIPS AND IMPROVE OUR ENGAGEMENT. INCLUDING WITH THOSE WHO HISTORICALLY HAVE NOT HAD A VOICE IN THE PROCESS WE CAN BE MORE EFFECTIVE IN DELIVERING PROJECTS AND CREATING LIVABLE COMMUNITIES IF WE BRING MORE VOICES INTO THE CONVERSATION. AS A DEPARTMENT WE NEED TO IMPLEMENT EFFICIENCIES TO DELIVER ON OUR COMMITMENTS. EFFICIENCIES MAKE THE MOST OF OUR RESOURCES TO REPAIR AND MAINTAIN THE SYSTEM MORE EFFECTIVELY AS HIGHLIGHTED BY SB ONE. WE ALSO NEED TO BE FLEXIBLE AND MULTI MODAL. CALIFORNIA CAN'T JUST BUILD ITS WAY OUT OF CONGESTION. WE HAVE TO LOOK AT IMPROVING ALL MODES OF TRANSPORTATION AS WE IMPLEMENT PROJECTS TO GIVE CALIFORNIANS OPTIONS TO MEET THEIR NEEDS. FINALLY WE NEED TO BE INNOVATIVE AND CREATIVE AND OUR APPROACH TO SOLVING PROBLEMS WE NEED TRANSFORMATIVE IDEAS TO ACHIEVE ASPIRATIONAL GOALS LIKE REDUCING OUR GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS BY 40% BY TWENTY THIRTY AND REACHING ZERO RELATE RELATED TRAFFIC FATALITIES AS WELL. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE CALTRANS ACHIEVEMENTS AND TO PRESENT THE GREAT PROGRESS THAT SB ONE HAS MADE POSSIBLE. I'M HAPPY TO RESPOND TO QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE AFTER THE REST OF MY COLLEAGUES SPEAK ON THE PANEL THANK YOU. THANK YOU DIRECTOR WILL TURN OVER TO THEIR EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION- MITCHELL WISE AND CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR POINT. THANK YOU SIR THANK YOU I'M A PLEASED TO BE HERE TODAY TO PROVIDE. MEETING IN BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE. IN MY NEW CAPACITY IT IS YES THEY WILL. WELCOME I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO SOME SLIPPAGE QUESTIONS. I'M GOING TO BE HERE TODAY READY FOR IT. I AM PLEASED TO BE HERE TO PROVIDE AN UPDATE ON SB ONE IMPLEMENTATION LIKE TO THANK SENATOR PELL AND THE COMMITTEE FOR INVITING US TO THIS HEARING. BOBBI GIVE YOU A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF THE COMMISSION'S WORK AN UPDATE ON THE COMMISSION'S IMPLEMENTATION OF THREE NEW PROGRAMS CREATED BY SB ONE. AND I'LL TALK ABOUT WHAT LIES AHEAD FOR THOSE PROGRAMS. AS BACKGROUND THE COMMISSION IS INDEPENDENT BODY THAT A STATUTORILY RESPONSIBLE FOR PROGRAMMING IN ALLOCATED TRANSPORTATION FUNDING FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF HIGHWAY PASSENGER RAIL TRANSIT AN ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT THE COMMISSION THREE PUBLIC AND OPEN PROCESS ESTABLISHES THE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT GUIDE THE DEDICATION OF FUNDS TO TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE REQUIREMENTS IN STATUTE AND THE STATE CONSTITUTION. THE COMMISSION THAT OVERSEES THE DELIVERY OF THESE PROJECTS BY CALTRANS AND LOCAL AND REGIONAL AGENCIES TO ENSURE THAT THEY ARE DELIVERED ON TIME AND WITHIN THE APPROVED BUDGET AND SCOPE. THE COMMISSION CONDUCTS ITS BUSINESS AT PUBLIC MEETINGS OPEN TO ALL STAKEHOLDERS AND THE PUBLIC. THE COMMISSION ALSO HOLDS DOZENS OF WORKSHOPS ANNUALLY TO SOLICIT INPUT FROM STAKEHOLDERS IN THE PUBLIC ON ITS POLICIES AND PROCESSES. I NOW LIKE TO TURN TO THE COMMISSION'S THREE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THREE NEW PROGRAMS CREATED BY SB ONE. THESE ARE THE SOLUTION FOR CONGESTED CORRIDORS PROGRAM WHICH FUNDS PROJECTS DESIGNED TO REDUCE CONGESTION AND HIGHLY TRAVELED AND HIGHLY CONGESTED CORRIDORS TO PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENTS THAT BALANCE TRANSPORTATION IMPROVEMENTS COMMUNITY IMPACTS AND ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS. THE LOCAL PARTNERSHIP PROGRAM WHICH PROVIDES FUNDING TO CITIES COUNTIES DISTRICTS AND REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION AGENCIES IN WHICH VOTERS HAVE APPROVED TAXES OR FEES SOLELY DEDICATED TO TRANSPORTATION OR THAT HAVE ENACTED TAXES OR FEES SOLELY DEDICATED TO TRANSPORTATION. AND THE TREE COURT OR ENHANCE PROGRAM WHICH FUNDS INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS ON FEDERALLY DESIGNATED TRADE CORRIDORS OR LONG OTHER QUARTERS THAT HAVE A HIGH VOLUME OF FREIGHT MOVEMENT. IMMEDIATELY AFTER SB ONE PASSED IN APRIL TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE COMMISSION BEGAN HOLDING WORKSHOPS TO DEVELOP GUIDELINES FOR THESE PROGRAMS AND CONTINUE TO CONTINUE TO DO SO THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. STARTING IN MAY TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE COMMISSION BEGAN ADOPTING PROGRAMS ARE PROJECTS. TO DATE THE COMMISSION HAS PROGRAM THE FOLLOWING SB ONE FUNDS FOR THESE PROGRAMS. ONE BILLION DOLLARS OVER FOUR YEARS FOR NINE PROJECTS IN THE SOLUTION COULD FOR SOLUTIONS FOR CONGESTED CORRIDORS PROGRAM ONE AN EXAMPLE OF A PROJECT FUNDED FROM THIS PROGRAM IS THAT SAN DIEGO NORTH COAST QUARTER PROGRAM WHICH WILL BILL TWENTY SIX MILES A MANAGE LANES ONE POINT THREE MILES. BICYCLE PEDESTRIAN FACILITIES THREE AUXILIARY LANES AND TWENTY SMART SIGNAL UPGRADES THIS PROJECT IS RECEIVING NEARLY TWO HUNDRED MILLION SB ONE FUNDS. THE COMMISSION IS PROGRAM ONE POINT FOUR BILLION OVER THREE FISCAL YEARS FOR TWENTY PROJECTS IN THE TRADE CORD OR ENHANCEMENT PROGRAM. AN EXAMPLE OF A PROJECT FUNDED FROM THIS PROGRAM IS THE FREIGHT INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM PROJECT IN ALAMEDA COUNTY. THIS PROJECT IS RECEIVING TWELVE AND A HALF MILLION IN SB ONE FUNDS TO IMPROVE OPERATIONS AND ESTIMATE FISSION CITY. ROAD RACE ROADWAYS ACCESSING THE PORT OF OAKLAND. FINALLY THE COMMISSION IS PROGRAMMED SIX HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS OVER THREE FISCAL YEARS. FOR OVER A HUNDRED PROJECTS IN THE LOCAL PARTNERSHIP PROGRAM. AN EXAMPLE OF A PROJECT FUNDED IN PART IN THIS PROGRAM. IS THAT REDLANDS PASSENGER RAIL PROJECT WHICH WILL CONSTRUCT NINE MILES OF RAIL TRACK AND FIVE NEW TRANSIT STATIONS IN SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY. THE PROJECT IS RECEIVING SEVENTEEN MILLION FROM THE LOCALS PARTNERSHIP PROGRAM. AND ALSO SIXTY FIVE MILLION FROM THAT SOLUTIONS FOR CONGESTED CORRIDOR PROGRAM. THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW WE HAVE SUCCESSFULLY LEVERAGED FUNDS ACROSS OUR PROGRAMS. AFTER ADOPTING THESE PROGRAMS ARE PROJECTS THE COMMISSION BEGAN APPROVING PROJECT ALLOCATIONS. AN ALLOCATION AUTHORIZES AN AGENCY TO BEGIN SPENDING THE FUNDS. DURING FISCAL YEAR EIGHTEEN NINETEEN THE COMMISSION APPROVED NEARLY ONE BILLION DOLLARS IN ALLOCATIONS FOR THESE PROGRAMS FOR SEVENTY TWO PROJECTS ARE PROJECTS SEGMENTS. THAT ACTUAL SPENDING ON THESE PROJECTS IS WELL UNDER WAY AT THE REIMBURSEMENTS HAVE AMOUNTED TO MORE THAN A TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS AN ACTUAL EXPENDITURES ARE LIKELY MUCH HIGHER THAN THAT. THEY HAVE YET BEEN BILL TO CALTRANS. ALL TOGETHER THE PROJECTS TO DATE FOR THESE THREE PROGRAMS RESULTED IN HUNDREDS OF MILES OF LOCAL ROAD REHABILITATION. NEW HIGH OCCUPANCY VEHICLE LANES AND NEW HOV LOOK INTO HOT LANES NEW BICYCLE LANES AS WELL AS DOZENS OF MILES OF NEW RAIL TRACK AND YOU TRANSIT STATIONS. ONCE THESE PROJECTS ARE COMPLETE THEY WILL IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF LIFE FOR PEOPLE ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. BY SAVING TIME IMPROVING AIR QUALITY. BEFORE I CLOSE I WANT TO TALK BRIEFLY ABOUT WHAT LIES AHEAD FOR THESE PROGRAMS. COMMISSION STAFF HAVE SPENT THE LAST YEAR ENGAGING WITH STAKEHOLDERS AND THE PUBLIC TO DEVELOP UPDATED GUIDELINES FOR THE NEXT CYCLE OF FUNDING FOR EACH OF THESE THREE PROGRAMS. THE COMMISSION ADOPTED NEW GUIDELINES AND ISSUED A CALL FOR PROJECTS FOR THE SOLUTION FOR CONGESTED CORRIDOR PROGRAM. AT ITS JANUARY MEETING WE EXPECT TO DO THE SAME FOR THE LOCAL PARTNERSHIP PROGRAM ENTRY COURT ANNOUNCEMENT PROGRAM. IN MARCH. APPLICATIONS WILL BE DUE IN JUNE AND THE COMMISSION EXPECTS TO ADOPT NEW PROGRAMS A PROJECTS BY DECEMBER. THAT CONCLUDES MY TESTIMONY BE HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS AFTER THE PANEL'S COMPLETE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- WILL NOW HEAR FROM RHONDA CRAFT SHE'S THE- OF OFFICE OF AUDITS AND INVESTIGATIONS. WE CALL HER THE INSPECTOR GENERAL. SO GENERAL CRAFT YOU HAVE THE FLOOR. THANK YOU KAREN BELL THAT WAS CREATED BY UNDER SP ONE THE OFFICE. THANK YOU THANK YOU. I'LL BEGIN WITH A BIT OF BACKGROUND IN TERMS OF THE STRUCTURE OR ORGANIZATION OF MY OFFICE THE INDEPENDENT OFFICE OF AUDITS AND INVESTIGATIONS OF STRUCTURED INTO FIVE AREAS WHICH A LINE. SOME OF THEM A LINE WITH CALTRANS MAJOR PROGRAM AREAS FOR EXAMPLE FINANCING OPERATIONS PROJECT DELIVERY PLANNING AND MODEL. IN ADDITION MY OFFICE INCLUDES A DIVERSITY AND SMALL BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM WHICH IS A MANDATE OF SB ONE OF THREE THAT REQUIRES THE INSPECTOR AND ALL TO. PART IT'S TO INCREASE. IT'S HIRING AND CONTRACTING PRACTICES WE ALSO HAVE IN INVESTIGATIONS AREA WHICH INCLUDES AN ETHICS HOTLINE. THE ETHICS HOTLINE IS A PHONE AND INTERNET BASED MULTI LINGUAL SERVICE FOR CALTRANS EMPLOYEES AND THE PUBLIC TO REPORT ALLEGATIONS OF FRAUD WASTE ABUSE EMPLOYEE MISCONDUCT AND OTHER ETHICS POLICY VIOLATIONS ADDITIONALLY THE SERVICE INCLUDES AN ASK ETHICS PHONE NUMBER AND EMAIL ADDRESS ARE AVAILABLE FOR CALTRANS EMPLOYEES TO SEEK GUIDANCE AND ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT SITUATION SIR ISSUES IN THE WORKPLACE. HE'S CALL CONCERNS. TURNING TO OUR AUDITS IN FISCAL YEAR EIGHTEEN NINETEEN THE OFFICE COMPLETED A TOTAL OF SEVENTY AUDITS INCLUDING PROGRAM. THAT ALSO INCLUDE MANDATE IT OUT IT'S REQUIRED BY FEDERAL AND OUR STATE REGULATIONS OPERATIONAL AUDITS BASED ON RISK ASSESSMENTS AND OTHER INTERNAL AUDIT SERVICES OR SPECIAL REQUEST AUDITS. THEY ALSO PERFORMED LOCAL AGENCY OUT ITS THESE INVOLVE- A STORAGE SHIP IN OVERSIGHT AGREEMENT BETWEEN FEDERAL HIGHWAY SAFETY ADMINISTRATION. AND CALTRANS WHICH REQUIRES THE DEPARTMENT TO ASSESS ACCOUNTING CONTROLS OF LOCAL AGENCIES TO VARIOUS MONITORING ACTIVITIES AND SOME PRESCRIBED BY CALTRANS LOCAL ASSISTANCE. THE INDEPENDENT OFFICE OF AUDITS AND INVESTIGATIONS MONITORED THESE ACTIVITIES THROUGH. PROCUREMENT ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION FINANCIAL SYSTEMS AND PRE AWARD CONTRACTS. TURNING SPECIFICALLY TO SB ONE AND IT'S PROGRESS DID YOU KNOW SB ONE REQUIRES CAL TRANS TO IMPLEMENT AND REPORT ON SEVERAL KEY ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES AND SETS BY SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE GOALS SB ONE ALSO REQUIRES CALTRANS TO GENERATE AT LEAST ONE HUNDRED MILLION PER YEAR AND EFFICIENCIES TO REINVEST IN MAINTENANCE AND REHABILITATION OF THE STATE'S HIGHWAY SYSTEM. THE INDEPENDENT OFFICE OF. EDUCATION'S HAS CONDUCTED SEVERAL AUDITS TO ENSURE THESE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS ARE MET. BEGINNING WITH THE BASELINE FOR SENATE BILL ONE PERFORMANCE OUTCOMES THIS AUDIT WAS ISSUED IN APRIL OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN. SB ONE REQUIRES CALTRANS MEET SPECIFIED PERFORMANCE OBJECTIVES OVER THE NEXT TEN YEARS INCLUDING THE EXPECTED CONDITION OF ASSETS SUCH AS PAVEMENT CULVERTS TRANSPORTATION MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS AND THE NUMBER OF BRIDGES FIXED. THIS AUDIT WAS DONE TO DETERMINE IF THE ESTABLISHED BASS LINES AND INVENTORY WAS SUPPORTED AND RELIABLE AND IF CALTRANS HAD A PLAN IN PERFORMANCE CRITERIA FOR EACH OF THE ASSETS. THE AUDIT DETERMINED THAT CALTRANS IS MAKING PROGRESS TOWARDS THE DEVELOPMENT OF PROCEDURES TO ACHIEVE SB ONE PERFORMANCE OUTCOMES. MOVING TO EFFICIENCIES MY OFFICE PERFORMED AN AUDIT OF EFFICIENCY MEASURES THIS AUDIT WAS ISSUED JULY TWENTY EIGHTEEN. SB ONE REQUIRES CALTRANS TO IMPLEMENT EFFICIENCY MEASURES WITH THE GOAL OF GENERATING AT LEAST ONE HUNDRED MILLION ANNUALLY IN SAVINGS TO INVEST IN MAINTENANCE AND REHABILITATION OF THE STATE HIGHWAY SYSTEM. THIS AUDIT DETERMINED THAT. CALTRANS IS MEETING THESE GOALS AND IN FACT MET THESE GOALS THROUGH NEPA VALUE ANALYSIS AND CONSTRUCTION MANAGER GENERAL CONTRACTOR. THEREFORE THE AUDIT DETERMINED THEY CALTRANS PROGRAMS WERE PRO ACTIVE IN IDENTIFYING AREAS OF EFFICIENCIES AND DEVELOPING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES TO ACHIEVE THE ONE HUNDRED MILLION IN KEEPING. WE'VE BEEN PERFORMED AN EFFICIENCY MEASURES VERIFICATION ON IT IN ORDER TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT THE EFFICIENCIES THAT HAD BEEN IDENTIFIED IN THE FIRST AUDIT WERE ACTUALLY EFFECTIVE AND WE'RE DOING WITH THE WE'RE SUPPOSED TO DO ALSO TO BACK. THE SAVINGS THAT CALTRANS IDENTIFY ITS FIRST EFFICIENCY REPORT. AND IN THE AUDIT WE DETERMINED AGAIN BUT BE CALTRANS WAS MEETING THE ONE HUNDRED MILLION AND EFFICIENCY SAVINGS- BASED ON THE AREAS OF NEED BUT VALUE ANALYSIS AND SEE HIM TO SEE THE AUDITORS ALSO DETERMINED BUT EIGHT POINT SEVEN MILLION OF THOSE AND EFFICIENCY SAVINGS WERE OVER REPORTED NONE THE LESS THEY DID MEET THEIR EFFICIENCY REQUIREMENTS. MOVING TO PERFORMANCE OUTCOMES FOR PAVEMENT. THE PURPOSE OF THIS AUDIT WAS TO DETERMINE IF THE DEPARTMENT HAS ADEQUATELY ESTABLISH A BASELINE FOR PAVEMENT CONDITION AND BENCHMARKS FOR ACHIEVING PAPER PERFORMANCE TARGETS. THE AUDITOR'S DETERMINED THAT THE DEPARTMENT ESTABLISHED A BASELINE TO MEASURE PROGRESS IN ACHIEVING THE PERFORMANCE OUTCOMES FOR PAVEMENT CONDITIONS. ESTABLISHED ANNUAL BENCHMARKS FOR THE THREE ASSET CLASSES THE PAVEMENT TO MEASURE PROGRESS TOWARD ACHIEVING THE SB WHEN PERFORMANCE TARGETS BY TWENTY TWENTY SEVEN. AND IMPLEMENT A PROCESS OF SYSTEMS TO TRACK ASSESS MONITOR AND REPORT ON PAVEMENT CONDITION AND PROGRESS TOWARD ACHIEVING THE PERFORMANCE TARGET. CALTRANS ALSO DEVELOPED CORRECTION CORRECTIVE ACTION PLANS TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WE MADE IN THIS ANALYSIS AND EVALUATION. MOVING. FORWARD WE WILL CONTINUE TO EVALUATE OR AUDIT OF FISSION SEES AS THEY ARE IDENTIFIED BY CALTRANS AND IN FACT WE ARE ALSO LOOKING AT THE EFFICIENCIES REPORTED FOR THE EIGHTEEN NINETEEN REPORT TO ENSURE THAT THOSE ARE RELIABLE AND SUPPORTABLE. WE ARE ALSO GOING TO BE GOING BACK AND LOOKING AT THE PROGRESS TOWARDS ACHIEVING THE SB WHEN PERFORMANCE OUTCOMES PAVEMENT WAS THE FIRST- OF THOSE- OF THAT OF THOSE AUDITS THAT ARE PLANNED WE INTEND TO GO BACK CáC ON THE OTHER FOR ASSETS. OF THAT ARE REQUIRED BY SB ONE. WE ARE ALSO LOOKING AT PROGRAM OVERSIGHT AND CAL RIPKEN ABILITY FOR VARIOUS PROGRAMS IDENTIFIED IN SB ONE. PURSUANT TO CDC GUIDELINES CALTRANS PROVIDES THE ADMINISTRATIVE OVERSIGHT FOR SB ONE PROGRAMS AND ENSURE IS THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE CDC GUIDELINES AND STEPS PROGRAM IS ALLOCATION REPORTING AND OTHER ACTIONS ARE FOLLOWED. THE TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY PLAN INCLUDES OF ITS OF LOCAL RECIPIENTS OF FUNDING UNDER THE ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM. THE BILL OF THESE AUDITS IS TO DETERMINE IF PROJECT COSTS CLAIMED AND REIMBURSED ARE SUPPORTED AND IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE GREEN MATH AND PROVISIONS IN STATE AND FEDERAL. LAWS AND REGULATIONS. WE ALSO BE LOOKING AT THE EFFECTIVENESS AND ACCURACY OF CALTRANS PROJECT COST ESTIMATES. THE PERSON PURPOSE OF THE STUDY IS TO DETERMINE IF THE PROCESS FOR ESTIMATING PROJECT COSTS CAN BE IMPROVED TO REDUCE CALTRANS IS RISK OF HAVING INSUFFICIENT FUNDS TO COMPLETE PROJECTS WITH OVER RUNS. OUT IT WILL BE A HISTORY OF PROJECTS HEARING THE INITIAL PROJECT ESTIMATE. FINAL PROJECT AS AT THE TIME OF THE BID. AND DO AND HOW CLOSE THE ORIGINAL ENGINEERS ESTIMATE WAS. WE WILL ALSO DO AN AUDIT OF DISTRICT DIRECTORS BORDERS. WHICH IS A FORMAL DOCUMENT APPROVING THE WAIVER OF NORMAL PROCEDURES FOR ADVERTISING BIDDING AND AWARDING CERTAIN CONTRACTS WHEN AN EMERGENCY OR OTHER EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES EXIST THE DISTRICT DIRECTORS BORDERS PROCESS WAS IDENTIFIED AS A HIGH RISK THAT SHOULD BE REVIEWED TO ENSURE CONTROL ARE ESTABLISH TO GUARD STATE PARKS. AND THEN LASTLY CALTRANS EFFORTS AND SIMPLY SAFETY CALTRANS NUMBER ONE GOAL IS TO PROVIDE SAFETY TO ITS EMPLOYEES AND THE PUBLIC WHO USE THE TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM THIS AUDIT PLAN INCLUDE OUT OF THE TRANCE EFFORTS TO INCREASE THE SOMEPLACE. CLOSE TO TAKE A SHE MIGHT HAVE THE COMET SO I A ALL OFF WITH THE GENERAL QUESTION- IF YOU PROJECT THE REVENUES AHEAD. THAT YOU'RE LOOKING TO. WILL WE BE ABLE TO COMPLETE ALL THE PROJECTS THAT WE COLLUDED IN SP ONE. IN TERMS OF THE PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS IN SB ONE. IS IT LOOK LIKE WE'RE ON SCHEDULE DO WE HAVE ENOUGH MONEY ARE WE COMPLETE THE PROJECTS OF. IN A TIMELY MANNER IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAW. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN FOR A FOR A QUESTION WE BELIEVE SO I MEAN IT'S A TEN YEAR BILL AND ROUGHLY. FIFTY FOUR FIFTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS- WE PRAY BELIEVE WE CAN WE CAN WE CAN GET THERE YOU KNOW. PART OF THE CHALLENGE OBVIOUSLY IN THE IN THE IN. IS THE FACT THAT THE WAY WE PAY FOR TRANSPORTATION IS BECOMING THE MODEL IS BECOMING DATED- AS WE SPEAK. THE MORE WE SHIFT TO- ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES- THE MORE. THE ACCOUNT THAT WE USED TO BUILD THE TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM- STARTS TO TAKE A TRIP- SO. LOOK IT LOOKS LIKE WE'RE COMPLETING ALL THE WORK THE ABSOLUTE IS YES THE ONE WAS A MAINTENANCE BACKLOG BASICALLY THE TRUCK LIKE. WE HAD THIS MAY CPAC LUGGAGE SIR BUILT UP. BOTH THE STATE AND LOCAL LEVEL AND YOU KNOW WE'RE TRYING TO A- REDUCE ALL OF. AIR QUALITY. FACILITIES TO IS OUR GOOD OF YOU HAVE THAT STANDARD. SO WE'RE LOOK IT LOOKS LIKE HOW MANY YEARS BEFORE WE GET TO THE- STANDARD WELL THE PLAN IS TEN YEARS THE PLANTS TEN YEARS AND FIFTY FOUR BILLION DOLLARS SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE FOCUSED ON WERE FOCUS ON EXACTLY WHAT THE LOSSES WE DO BUT WE- SOME OF MY- COLLEAGUES THAT.WE ARE NO AND I'M SURE YOU BUT THIS EFFORT WITH THE ROAD USER CHARGE. THAT'S THAT'S BEING WORKED ON. HOW WE CAN THAT SHIFT THAT. ON THE LINE. NOT JUST PAIN. OUT COMING FROM- FROM FROM FROM GAS TAX AND DIESEL TAX BUT- OF THE PLAN TO DO THAT WERE FULLY FOCUS ON RIGHT NOW IS ABSOLUTELY GETTING THAT FIFTY FOUR BILLION DOLLAR. AT LEAST A PART OF IT THE LITTLE GIRL. SO YOU'RE ARE WITH THE OTHER HALF OF THE FIFTY. FIFTY FOUR BILLION DOLLARS BUT ARE PART OF IT WE'RE COMPLETELY LOCKED INTO SEEN THAT WE MEET THAT FIX IT FIRST. REQUIREMENTS COMMENTS FROM OTHERS. DOES THE COMMISSION REVIEW THAT AND HAVE THE THEY HAVE. IS A RECALL LIKE QUARTERLY REPORTS. ARE THEY SHOWING- ANY RED FLAGS ON THIS THIS ISSUE OF KEEPING ON A TIME SCHEDULE TO COMPLETE ALL THE PROJECTS. SO BAD THAT THE COMMISSION IS REQUIRED TO BASED ON THE INFORMATION CALTRANS TO PRESENTS TO REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE ON THE PROGRESS TOWARDS MEETING THE SP ONE GOALS. WE WE'VE REPORTER ONCE AND INDICATED CALTRANS IS PROGRESSING TO MEET TACKLES AT THAT TIME WHICH IS A LITTLE OVER A YEAR AGO THERE WAS A COUPLE OF AREAS WHERE WE STILL NEEDED TO TECH. COME TO TERMS OR WHAT THE DEFINITION OF THE GOAL WHAT SAMPLE WHAT DOES FIX FIVE HUNDRED ME AND CAME WHEN AGREEMENT ON THE COMMISSION ADOPTED WHAT IS FIX ME WE HAVE A CERTAIN LEVEL. WE'RE DOING RIGHT NOW CRAP PENSION HER TO HER OFFICE LOOKED INTO THAT. THE PAVEMENT SAID THAT IT DIDN'T. SEEM THERE WITHOUT THEM A C. OF. FOLLOW UP THAT AUDIT AND WHAT THEIRRESPONSE WILL BE TO AND REPORTING. BUT CAN YOU ON WHAT WE'VE BEEN EVERY WITH TO SEE WHO'S- WORDS. THE SO CAN. HAVE OUR STAFF AND OUR SALES IN. THE ISSUE NOW BOB SO I WANTED AS TO SECRETARY. SINCE VERY FROM ERROR WASH DC IN THE TRANSPORTATION FIND OUT WE IN OUR IN OUR OVERALL BUDGET WE GET TO- FEDERAL GASOLINE TAX- HIGHWAY TRUST FUND- MONIES WE GOOD MONIES FOR TRANSIT PROJECTS AND SO FORTH. AND GERMAN TO FIVE ZERO A FEW WEEKS AGO- PRESENTED THE HOUSE. OF FRAMEWORK WHICH I PASSED OUT TO ALL THE ALL THE MEMBERS THEY ALL HAVE A COPY OF IT- THE FOR HOUSE FRAMEWORK. IDENTIFIES THERE. THE APPROACH TO- FUNDING HIGHWAY TRANSIT- WATER ALL IT GOES BEYOND JUST TRANSPORTATION HOW DOES WHAT THEY'RE PROPOSING FIT IN TO OUR SB WHAT OUR GOALS ARE DIRECTIONS- IS IT THE CONSISTENT OR AND WHAT DO YOU HAVE AN OPINION ABOUT THE FRAMEWORK OF YOU DEVELOP DECISION A POLICY POSITION ON THE FRAMEWORK. OF THE SUPPORTING IT ASKING FOR CHANGES OR WHAT IS YOUR POSITION RIGHT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN. THERE IS A LOT TO LIKE IN THE HOUSE FRAMEWORK- RECENTLY RELEASED BY CHAIRMAN TO FALL ZERO. IN FACT. WHAT YOU SEE IN THE FREE MARKET IS- REFLECTIVE OF THE PRINCIPLES THAT WE PUT OUT LAST FALL- CALIFORNIA POLICY PARTY PRINCIPLES FOR RE AUTHORIZATION OF THE FAST ACT RIGHT AND SO THERE IS A LOT OF SYNERGY. OF NOTE THE- THE HOUSE FRAMEWORK INCREASES OVERALL PROPOSES TO INCREASE OVERALL FUNDING ACROSS. ALL MODES THAT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO INTERCITY PASSENGER RAIL AND ROAD IN OUR REAL A HUGE BUMP UP WHICH IS IMPORTANT FOR CALIFORNIA- THERE ARE ALSO PROVISIONS PERTAINING TO CLIMATE CHANGE RESILIENCY. SAFETY TRANSIT SO THERE IS A LOT TO LIKE IN THE HOUSE FROM WORK ON PERSONALLY EXCITED ABOUT IT. I ALSO WANT TO MENTION THAT THE ON THE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE COUPLE THE U. S. SENATE. ENVIRONMENT PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE OF REPORTED A BILL LAST FALL. WHICH ALSO IS VERY ROBUST IN NATURE- AND- INCLUDES A RESILIENCE GRANT PROGRAMS SO. WHETHER YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE U. S. SENATE BILL OR THE HOUSE FRAMEWORK. THERE IS A LOT TO LIKE- I SHOULD MENTION THAT- DIRECTOR- SHOCKING AND I. WILL BE IN WASHINGTON- LATER THIS MONTH TO. MAKE THE ROUTER THE OFFER CONGRESSIONAL TO THEM TO DO. CAN THIRTIES AS IN THE WE WILL OUT LAST TALK ABOUT THE HEALTH FROM ACROSS WELL SO A VERY ABOUT WITH THE HOUSE HAS PUT OUT AND WITH THE U. S. SENATE HAS ALREADY REPORTED. LIKE TO SEE. ANY INFORMATION REGARDING- THE STATE THE- POSITION ON THE FRAMEWORK THE UPCOMING I THINK I THINK. THE LEGISLATION WILL PROBABLY BE TAKEN UP POST ELECTION I WOULD IMAGINE SO IT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW IS THERE SERVE HAVING THE FIELD HEARINGS GETTING READY- WOULD THEY HAVE A IN CALIFORNIA ON THE INFRASTRUCTURE. THE FRAMEWORK FOR I THINK THERE'S A REASONABLY GOOD CHANCE AND- IN FACT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF CALIFORNIA CONGRESSIONAL MEMBERS ON THE TEAM AND I CAN READ- CHAIRMAN DEFAULT WHO HAS VISITED ON VISIT ORANGE COUNTY- AND OTHER PLACES AROUND THE STATE- WE ARE MEETING WITH HIS STAFF AND WILL ENCOURAGE HIM TO. TO DO A FEW MORE IN CALIFORNIA SO AGAIN I THINK THAT THE CONGRESSIONAL DELEGATIONS WELL PLACED AND WELL POSITIONED TO. ADVOCATE FOR THE STATE'S NEEDS SINCE THERE ARE QUITE A FEW OF THEM ON THE COMMITTEE RIGHT I YEAH I HOPE THAT WE CAN GET. SOME FIELD HEARINGS BECAUSE- IT SEEMS TO ME THAT IF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO HOME. IS GOING TO BE A PARTNER THE OUGHT TO KEEP PACE WITH THE FUNDING. THAT WE'VE DONE WITH SP ONE SO IF THEY FALL BEHIND THAT JUST DIMINISHES OUR EFFORT WITH SB ONE CORRECT RIGHT RIGHT AND AS YOUKNOW THE PERENNIAL QUESTION WASHINGTON IS HOW TO PAY FOR. A LARGE RIGHT PROGRAM THERE IS NO SUCH CONSENSUS YET WHETHER IT'S INCREASING THE GAS TAX INDUCTING INDEXING IT USING SOME MORE OTHER FORMER FINANCE SO THEY HAVEN'T GOTTEN THERE YET BUT AT LEAST THEY HAVE A FRAMEWORK A PROPOSED AND THE QUESTION BEFORE THEM IS HOW DO YOU PAY FOR IT. OKAY SIR SKIN ANSWER BATES. CAN WE GO BACK TO THE JUDGE. FIRST QUESTION BECAUSE WHEN WE HAD OUR INITIAL HEARINGS ON SP ONE WE IDENTIFIED A HUNDRED AND THIRTY SEVEN. BILLION DOLLARS IN INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS WE'VE COME UP WITH FIFTY FOUR WE SORT OF DRIFTED DOWN SAID LET'S PUT DOCTOR IN THERE. SO WHAT ABOUT THE REST OF IT YOU KNOW IN TEN YEARS HOW ABOUT THE OTHER EIGHTY THREE BILLION THAT WE ONCE UPON A TIME. IDENTIFIED IT'S NOT INCLUDED IN SB ONE WHAT ABOUT THAT. QUESTION QUESTION CENTER AND AS I THINK EVERYBODY IN THE TRANSPORTATION WORLD KNOWS JUST BE ONE WAS A CRITICALLY IMPORTANT DOWN PAYMENT IT DOESN'T COVER ALL THE NEEDS AND SO WITH THE AVAILABLE FUNDING WE HAVE- IT'S REALLY POOR TO TAKE A RISK BASED APPROACH- TO ADD ON A DRESS THE MOST PRESSING NEEDS WHETHER IT'S ON PURPOSE CORPORATE. TOTALS AND WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO FIGHT OTHERS AND- THAT'S THE TO TELL TO FROM US. TURKEY WE SUFFER GOT TECH GRADUATE YOU ALSO FOR YOUR APPOINTMENT. HOW ABOUT FROM SEA TO SEA OUR PERSPECTIVE. WELL I THINK SECRETARY KIM WAS EXACTLY RIGHT- WE IDENTIFY AS YOU POINTED OUT WE IDENTIFIED A NEED THAT WAS EVEN LARGER THAN SB ONE WE CAN ONLY DO WHAT WE HAVE FUNDING FOR. I'M NOT A CHECK. CLIMATE RESILIENCY ADAPTATION AND FIX THE FIRST ONE COULD ARGUE THAT THEY MAY HAVE BE. COMPETING FORCES BECAUSE SOME OF THE ADAPTATION EFFORTS THAT WE NEED TO TAKE WE JUST DON'T NEED TO TALK ABOUT WHAT THE TRANSPORTATION PEOPLE WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT THE FLOOD CONTROL PEOPLE WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT WITH THE CLIMATE PEOPLE WHAT ARE THE OTHER FACTORS THAT ARE HAPPENING THAT ME EXPAND HE THE LIFE OF SOME OF OUR ROADS IN IT IN A DISTRESSED AREA WERE THAT. FOR A SHORTENED THEM IF WE DON'T DO ANYTHING ON ADAPTATION SO MY QUESTION IS THAT. DO YOU CAN THINK OF PARTS OF HIGHWAY ONE WHEN WE KNOW IF WITH SEALEVEL RISE ARE GOING TO BE UNDER WATER. SO WHAT IS YOUR THINKING DO IF NOTHING HAPPENS THE OTHER SOME EXTERNAL THESE THAT ARE GOING I'M WERE CHANGES ARE BEING MADE ON ALAMEDA CREEK. MITIGATE UP TO ONE THIRD OF SEA LEVEL RISE WHEN DO YOU GUYS GET THAT INFORMATION THAT WOULD HELP YOU WHAT YOU'RE PLANNING ON WHETHER WE ASK. SURFACE R- PROPOSAL OF A DIFFERENT HOUSE HAD ALL GET WORKED OUT OF ALL STARTED IN ALL ALL HAVE DIRECTOR WITH SHOCK AND TALK ABOUT WHAT CALTRANS HAS BEEN DOING ITS OF ASSESSMENTS. THE CHALLENGE IS HOW TO PAY FOR UP PROJECTS THAT INCREASE THE RESILIENCY OF A TRANSPORTATION ASSET. I BELIEVE IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN SB ONE DID HAVE A PROGRAM FOR THAT PURPOSE AND IT MAY HAVE IT MAY HAVE BEEN LAST FOR A COUPLE YEARS- THERE NEEDS TO BE ADDITIONAL- WAYS TO COVER THAT- THAT'S INCLUDED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. IS ALSO MENTIONED IN THE OF THE HOUSE FRAMEWORK WE JUST DISCUSSED AS WELL AS THE U. S. SENATE BILL SO THAT'S GONNA BE THE CHALLENGE GOING FORWARD HOW DO WE COVER THE COST TO MAKE THESE PROP PERSONALLY. AND WITHOUT THE DIRECTOR TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT CALTRANS BEEN DOING TO US RESILIENCY AT THAT LEVEL. THANK YOU SIR THANK YOU SIR TURKEY OUT SENATE. EXCELL QUESTION AND- NOT I THINK IT REALLY DESERVES A GREAT RESPONSE AS WELL THAT WILL PROBABLY TAKE A LONG TIME FROM FROM. OUR FROM OUR END BUT ALL ALL TOUCH WITH TWO THINGS VERY QUICKLY NUMBER ONE. ONE RIVAS WAS EXCITED TO COME HERE AND TAKE ON THIS THIS RESPONSIBILITY. WAS THE AMOUNT OF WORK THAT WAS ALREADY HAPPENED WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT AROUND THE STRUCTURE. AND HAS. WE HAVE TWELVE DESTROY. TEN OF THOSE THE HOW FINALIZE WHAT WE CALL OF THE BILL ASSESSMENT REPORT. SO THOSE VULNERABILITIES. BLOW THINGS THAT YOU LIKE SEA LEVEL RISE- AND WHERE WE HAVE PHONE ABILITIES WITHIN OUR NETWORK- AND WE'VE ALSO GOT TAKEN THE NEXT STEP WE'RE WORKING ON. DEPUTATION PLANS IT SO WHAT WE NEED TO BEYOND. A DONE A FINE PHONE A BILL ARE TO HAVE ST. WE BUILD THE PROJECT WERE. I THANK YOU KNOW WORK THROUGH OUR TOPIC OF A PROCESS HOW DO WE MAKE SURE. THAT WE ARE DRY THE THOSE FORMER BILL THAT WERE GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT THINGS LIKE SEA LEVEL RISE YOU MENTIONED. THAT WE CAN SOMEHOW ADDESS IT. NUMBER TWO JUST QUICKLY. PENSION THE FACT THAT THERE'S POSH THERE'S A THERE'S SOME CONTENTION THERE A CONFLICT BETWEEN THEM BETWEEN THOSE TWO BETWEEN THOSE TWO THINGS- I THINK THERE ARE SOME- THERE SOME LINKAGES AS WELL THAT WE NEED TO DISCUSS A LITTLE BIT MORE- AN EXAMPLE OF THAT IS AS WE DO A FIX IT FIRST. IT WAS A WERE RESURFACING ROAD. WE SHOULD BE LOOKING FOR MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR MOBILITY OPTIONS SO FOR EXAMPLE WERE SERVICE IN A ROW WE CAN FIT IN A PLANO CAN FIT IN. OF A BUT THIRTEEN TRADE SERVICE. THINGS LIKE THAT THEY ACTUALLY ULTIMATELY HELP MOBILITY WHICH REDUCES EMISSIONS WHICH- HELPS WITH THE CLIMATE CHALLENGES WE FACE. SO WITH THEIR SEVENTY ONE THERE ARE WE NEED TO MAKE THE ACTION. NOTES OF IT FIRST. ABSOLUTELY. FORTUNE WHAT THAT'S DON'T FORCES WILL BE A AYE WHICH IS OFFERED AS A YOU KNOW AS AN IDENTIFIED WE ALL KNOW THAT THERE'S PROBLEMS WITH HIGHWAY THIRTY. SEVEN I DON'T WITH THE NAPA I'VE BEEN THE NAPA IN IN WE ALL KNOW THE BIG ANSWER WHICH WILL INCREASE RESILIENCY AN ADAPTATION IS TO BUILD A BRIDGE. AND ALL THAT THAT WE HAVE THIS SURGE OF WATER TO GO UNDERNEATH IT AND IT WILL BENEFIT THE ENTIRE BAY AREA. NOT JUST THE NAPA PEOPLE NOW WHETHER THAT'S A P. THREE OR CENTER. ON A NEW BILL WHAT THE HELL FOR FUN FIRM WHERE HOWEVER THAT GETS DONE. IN WE ALL KNOW THAT THAT'S THE TO DO WE PRAY. AND ALL. THE LOBBYING. PEOPLE MISTER. MY THE- INTERNET WAS TRYING TO MAKE IS THAT DO WE- SPEND MONEY. REPAVE AT ARE PUTTING A BIKE LAKE IN A THE EGGS. RAY RIGHT NOW ON KNOW THIS IS AN IDEA. AS ONE OF. WAS JUST. THAT'S WHAT I'M- WONDER BECAUSE THERE THINGS GOING ON LIKE IN THE FLOOD CAN. IN THESE OTHER AREAS ON RISK. AND PROCESSES BE SEE D. C. ALL THESE OTHER FOLKS THAT ARE. OUTSIDE THE CHURCH. IN A BUT- PACKED ISSUE SAID WOULD CAPS. CHANGES A LEVEL RISE TO OFFICER YOU GUYS TO ACCOUNT. AND SAYING ARE WE SHOULD REPAY THAT BECAUSE NOT GOING TO BE ON THE WATER OR MAYBE. WHATEVER THAT IS CENTER. THERE'S COLLABORATION THESE AREAS BEYOND JUST THE WORLD OF TRANCE. THAT NEEDS. AND THOSE PLANNING PROCESS SECOND THE TO IT TO TAKE ALSO. THEY ARE THEY'VE IT I LIKE TO. YEAH SMART MORE MONEY SO PRETEND I HAVE A- WELL YOU'LL SPEND ANY WE'VE THIS. FEDERAL INFRASTRUCTURE FRAMEWORK AND IF I JUST USE A- THE HUNDRED AND FIVE BILLION DOLLARS THAT THEY WANT TO PUT IN TRANSIT THAT WOULD BE THIRTEEN BILLION BOX IN IN THE RAPE INVESTMENTS FIFTY FIVE THAT'S THE SIX MAY HAVE TOLD HIM NOT. TO ART. ARE TWENTY BILL. THAT THAT THAT WOULD COME IN WE GOT THE- MORE CUTS MEMBERS HERE WE CAN PROBABLY FIRE OVER THAT FROM EUROPE FROM THE CTC AND WE GET A LOT OF CONVERSATION ON HIGH SPEED RAIL WHETHER WE SHOULD FINISH THE HIGH SPEED RAIL BLUE SOME OF THE MONEY TO THE BOOKENDS WE'VE. IN A CITY. THE TRAIN THE COME THROUGH FREE ONE WHERE I LIVE DE CONNECT WITH THE BALL IN THAT SEEMS LIKE A OBVIOUS FOR THE CAPITAL CORDER THERE EIGHT IN THE BART AND THE DUMB PARTNERING YOU THINK HEY HOW ABOUT HEY PLANNERS ONE WE HAVE ONE STATION. DOES THAT CONFLICT. THIS THING MERCH IF I HAD CHUNK OF TWENTY BILL BOX FROM THE FEDERAL. TO SPREAD OUT LIKE PEANUT BUTTER OR DO WE- DO A COUPLE OF. TRANSFORM PRIDE TO ARE GOOD HAVE A IMPACT YOUR- SINCE YOU GUYS ARE WITH. EIGHT SIR THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION AND SPREE. YEAH SO I. THE ANSWER WILL BE. THE ON HOW THE LAW IS. WHAT THE WHAT'S THE- REQUIREMENT HOW CAN YOU USE THOSE FOR. DOES IT HAVE TO BE EXISTING RAIL OR AS YOU SAY TRANSFORMATIVE NEW EXTENSIONS SO REAL REFUSE TO SEEN HOPKINS IT IS IT FOR. IS IT A GRANT PROGRAM BUT CLEARLY YOU POINTED TO THE TO THE CHILD WHICH IS. IF FORGET GIVEN A CHUNK OF MONEY SAY TWENTY BILLION. HOW TO USE IT FOR- THAT IT SHE- GOALS. THANK YOU. THAT IS TRUE TO THE SUCH GOING TO BE THE CHALLENGE FOR US. CITIES IN THE- HI THERE BRIAN ALWAYS SAID I THE SEC ARTICULATE IT VERY CLEAR THE FEDS ARE NOT JUST GONNA GIVE US MONEY WAY WITHOUT TELLING US HOW TO SPEND IT. THE STATE LET MAY WISH TO WEAR ON ON HOW TO IT YOU KNOW IT'S UP AUSTIN TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO IMPLEMENT THAT. BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT'S A OF MONEY BUT AT NOT ENOUGH MONEY. THE ONE THING YOU WANT THINGS I WOULD SAY ON YOUR QUESTION IS THAT- PAST PRACTICE HAS BEEN TO FIND THINGS SO. THE PAY AS THEY GO ALONG. AND WHAT THAT ENTAILS IS. ALL THESE DIFFERENT PHASES RIGHT LIKE ARE PART PROJECT RIGHT TO SAN JOSE ALL THESE DIFFERENT PHASES AND YOU HAVE TO DO THREE FOR A OURS THREE OR FOUR AND DURING PLANS ROUTE YEAH SO. THE WHOLE IDEA OF MULTI YEAR FUNDING SHOLD BE APPROACHED WE DID SB NINE A FEW YEARS AGO IT ALLOWED. THE TRANSIT FUNDS TO BE MULTI YEAR GRANTS. AND I THINK THAT'S A GOOD DIRECTION THAT NEEDS TO BE EXPLORED MORE. IT WHETHER OR NOT THAT'S A GOOD DIRECTION GIVEN THE FACT THAT WE'RE HAVING THIS FASTER. YOU KNOW THIS SO. FEDERAL FRAMEWORK- PROPOSAL WE NEED TO LOOK AT LIKE SERVE HOW WE PLAN AND BILL PROJECTS MULTI YEAR FUNDING. AND DEVELOP A MULTI YEAR PLAN. LIKE FEDERAL NEWS STARTS PROGRAM USED TO DO I MEAN THEY STILL DO IT RIGHT YES IF SO- WHEN WE WHEN WE DEVELOP THAT. SB NINE. THE WAS SOMETHING THAT WE MODELED AFTER THE NEW STARTS. KANEMOTO YOUR BUT THIS A CONTRACT IF YOU HAVE TO SPEND THE MONEY AT CERTAIN DATE. THIS ONLY WE CAN BUILD THE THOSE KINDS OF PROJECTS I THINK SO I THINK ITHINK THAT WOULD BE A GOOD MODEL FOR WHAT SENATOR WHITE HOUSE HE'S TALKING ABOUT THESE BIGGER SCALE. PROJECTS THAT MIGHT INVOLVE MANY DIFFERENT SOURCES OF MY- MY IN A FOUR FIVE. SINCE WE HAVE THE CT SEEING CALTRANS HERE MISTER CHAIR THAT WOULD BE THE PART SANTA CLARA. SHOULD WE GET TO THE END OF THE- OF THE CYCLE IN IN MY DISTRICT COULD IN AT THE LEVI'S. OKAY LEAVE. OKAY SIR. HAS SOME CORE. SINCE SPEED WELL AS MEN I DO WANT TO OUT THAT DON'T ALL KNOW THE OF A TRANSIT PROJECT AND WHILE THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF COPPER. ABOUT US OF SPEED RAIL WHEN CONGRESS I HAD MY UP TODAY WITH THE FACT THAT FOR A ONE POINT SIX MILE STRETCH AND THIS IS A- POINT SIX MILES BRIDGE. OF THE PERSON AND SAN. THE COP ONE FOR IN. STRUGGLE TO TRY TO. ONE OF OVER THE LAST DOLLARS FOURTH MY- OF HIGH RAIL IN THIS ALI TO CONNECT. NUMBER SEVEN WORKING CONNECT WITH THE OUT. PRESS THAT ALREADY GOES INTO SANTA CLARA CARRYING THOU OF AREA WORKER WHERE THE JOB CENTERS ARE. I WILL POINT OUT THAT IN THE- AND THE LATE. IT WAS A PRIOR. TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE COULD GET MORE HOUSING AND JOBS RICH AREAS AND MORE JOBS IN HOUSING RICH AREAS LIKE THE CENTRAL VALLEY THE ECONOMY WAS DOWN TO THAT. AND WINNER WITH THE FINDING IT TO THAT KIND OF THING AT RESULT STAGE CONTENT TO MOVE INTO CENTRAL. AND SIR AFFORDABLE. KNOWING THAT THE TRUCK OFF THREE TO SIX HOURS A DAY. COMMUTER HIGHWAY TO THE JOHN BIRCH. SO AS WE LOOK AT TRANSIT PRO AND TRY FINE I JUST WANT MAKE SURE WE WERE. THOSE KIND. WHO ACTED RESPONSIBLY I KNEW THEY NOT AFFORD HOMES AND THE BAY AREA AND THEY MADE LIFE CHANGING CHOICES. SPEND THREE AND SIX HOURS A DAY ON THE ROAD SO THAT THEY COULD HAVE. FAN IS SO IN YOU WERE THE FINDING A WERE CAR. ABOUT WHETHER PRIDE IS BY ARE NOT I WON AT EVERYONE TO RE THAT SPEED RAIL IS VIABLE NOT ONLY FOR THE TRANSIT THAT IT PROVIDES BUT THE ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR THOSE WHO CANNOT AFFORD TO LIVE IN THE AREA. OKAY THANK. I JUST HAVE ONE LESS QUESTION FOR THE SEARCH OF MAYBE IT IS A DIFFERENT AGENTS BUT WHEN THE FOR GOVERNMENT CHANGED VEHICLES THE HOT AIR QUALITY STANDARDS. HOW DOES THAT AFFECT THE COMPLETION PROJECTS A CALTRANS ANY OTHER PROJECTS AND- OF WHAT IS WHAT IS THE RESPONSE FOR THAT IF YOU'RE REFERRING TO THE SAFE VEHICLES RULE ONE YES I AM YES SO. MY WAY BACKGROUND YOU PROBABLY KNOW THIS THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ISSUED THEIR THEIR FIRST RULE PART ONE A FEW MONTHS AGO TOOK EFFECT IN NOVEMBER. AND UP PART COMING OUT SOMETIME IN THE NEAR FUTURE- COMBINED THOSE RULES- COULD HAVE A POTENTIALLY- DEVASTATING IMPACT ON PROJECT DELIVERY CALIFORNIA IT'S A TACTICAL THE- BUT THE UPSHOT IS THAT. THE EMISSIONS USED BY CAR. HIS OWN MIND BY THE US HE- IT'S A RULE NOW I SAY THAT CARBON HAS COMPLETED ALL OF THE MODELING A JOE THE HAVE SOME TO A EVERYTHING OF THE- AND THE BALL IS IN. COURT EPA WORK WITH THE FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION. ISSUE CONFORMITY DETERMINATIONS- AND SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE WAITING FOR RIGHT NOW I WILL SAY THAT. ACTION A FEW MONTHS AGO TO MAKE SURE THAT FREE M. P. O.'S. SLOW AUG. SIXTH AUG IN SENDAI HOW THE REGIONAL TO. PLANS OF. BEFORE THE EFFECTIVE. OF SAFE VEHICLES WERE POP. ONE AT. THE WOULD HAVE BEEN IN WORLD OF HER AND WE ARE WORKING OTHER MP MPO STRUCK STATE IN SAID ASK. EMPTY AND WHOSE DOES ARE COME UP TO HAVE THEIR OR PEAS APPROVE AND SO WE ARE ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN THIS WE HAVE A- INTERNAL WORKING GROUP WORKING WITH ALL OF THE PARTNERS. I WOULD APPRECIATE IT IF. LIEU FIRM BODY COULD. IT'S YES AS THAT GOES ALONG WITH THE TO FOR THAT THAT. OR PRO TO LOOK. PROBABLY EFFECTOR BUT MAY THROUGH THE BUDGET. IS IT SURE. ONLY CERTAIN IT DELAYS THE WHICH MAKE SOME MORE BASICALLY RIGHT IS A IT IS DELAYS PROJECTS WHEN HE DELIVER PRO A CALL MORE. ESSENTIALLY IN A REQUIRE CHANGE IN SOME THE BROAD RIGHT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS TO ISSUE CAN JUST TO DETERMINE IF A PRO NEEDS CLEANER RECALL. IF THAT FOR ME TO TURN XIN ISN'T MAY. THE PROJECT CANNOT GO FOR. AND SO THE CONTENT BE FOR. TO ANOTHER APPROVED PRIOR WORSE. THIS COULD DEPEND ON THE COLOR OF MONEY BUT AS SUCH IT WOULD BE VERY TO. GOTCHA OKAY YOU. SIR BATES YOU HAD A YOU'RE BACK ALL THAT IN TIME BEFORE I GO AHEAD SENATOR YEAH FOR THE ARE OF SPECIFIC I YOU BROTHER THE FACT THAT THERE IS THE FRAUD REPORT. AND IT'S A AND RUNNING WHAT IS THE USE ARE YOU GET YOU KNOW REAP FROM YOU KNOW HERE IN THE CAPITAL OR ON THE DISTRICTS AND OF ALL ANY REPORTS ON. THE FRAUD AND ABUSE OF A THE IS A YOU SAID SHE OF THE ON THAT. YES WE RECEIVE A PHONE CALL THROUGHOUT THE STATE INCLUDING CAL HICK DO OFF BUT THE PART PRIMARILY. THE COMPLAINTS ARE GENERALLY MY SUPERVISOR DOESN'T LIKE ME THEY PASSED OVER ME FOR FIVE TIMES FOR PROMOTIONS I THINK I'M BEING RETALIATED AGAINST. AND UP. MISS OF STATE THE REAP TIME INCORRECTLY THOSE TYPES OF THINGS WERE SAYING NOTHING A MAJOR THAT RISES TO THE LEVEL OF FRAUD WASTE ABUSE AT LEAST TO THIS POINT. WELL MAYBE THAT'S GOOD NEWS SALUTE ABOUT SIDE IT IS THE TOXIC WORK ENVIRONMENT ISSUES LIKE HAVE MORE HR THAN IT IS WHAT YOU INTENDED IT TO BE SO GOOD. QUESTION TWO IF IT CAME UP BY BEING CONCERN ABOUT WHAT I SEE IS A MOUNTING CONGESTION AND IN LAW THE LOCAL. WE WENT LOCAL SO. HAVE THEIR OPPORTUNITY. CAN REST TO THAT TO BED WITH THE LOCAL PARTNERS IN THE RED. FOR OB YEAH TRANSFERRED. ODD TO. AS OF THIS DIET ON WHICH IS THE TERMS THAT ARE BEING YOU OUT THERE WE SEE A LOT OF MOUNTING. ON SOME OF THE PRIMARY ARTERIALS NOT THE MAJOR AS MUCH AS THE LOCAL STREETS AND ROADS AND- HERE ARE. OTHER CAN COMMUNITIES. IN IS THERE GO TO BE IN FOR US OF WHETHER THAT. IS VALUE AS WE THINK TERMS OF. THE I THINK THAT HADN'T TO DO WITH MOVING PEOPLE OUT OF AUTOMOBILES ON ON TWO BIKES THINGS WERE CREATE LESS GREENHOUSE ASSN IN MISSIONS BUT- WHEN YOU'VE GOT THE OTHER. THE OTHER LANE WITH WILL SIT CARSON THANK YOU. FAME BOB I MEAN I THINK THERE'S ACTUALLY A- OF FORMULA. FOR IF YOU'RE SITTING IN A CAR RAINING YEAH YOUR MEETING YOU KNOW TOXIC FUMES IT'S AS BAD AS YOU DON'T SO MANY. ROADBLOCKS AND. THIRTY MEASURE ABOUT GOING. KIND OF A CAR TURNS AWAY REPORTING ON. WELL I WOULD SAY WE AT THE COMMISSION I'M NOT SOMETHING LIKE THAT AS YOU POINT OUT THAT MAY BE SO BASS BEST DANCE THE LOCAL LEVEL WE SEEN THERE'D BEEN A COUPLE OF. HI PUBLICIZED CASES WHERE AT WHERE THAT'S OCCURRED- I KNOW AT LEAST ONE JURISDICTION WHERE THEY WHERE THEY ON DID THAT- BUT I SURE THERE ARE EQUAL NUMBER WHERE THEY HAVEN'T DONE DONE IT. ON DONE IT THEY'VE KEPT THE WEIGHT IS A DOZEN HERE IN SACRAMENTO- BUT- ONE THING I WOULD POINT OUT IN OUR ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM WHICH IS PARTLY FUNDED BY. BY SB ONE S. ONE FOR. 80% INCREASE THAT PROBE. ALTHOUGH PROJECTS ARE LOCAL PRIORITY AND ALL. I PROUD. BY THE- BY THE- BY THE RE AGENCY. BURKE AN- EXTENSIVE PUBLIC PARTISAN. COME TO HELP THAT THAT THIS IS A PROJECT THAT THAT'LL LOCAL AREA AND THAT THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT WANTS SO HOPEFULLY BY HAVING SUCH A PROCESS WE WOULD- AVOID. SOME THAT THE CHALLENGES THAT YOU'RE FACING. ONE THING ALSO THROW IN ONE OF THE THINGS WHERE WE'RE LOOKING AT DOING IN THIS NEXT CYCLE- IS- PILOTING A COUPLE OF WHAT THEY CALL QUICK BUILD PROGRAMS FOR THE ACTOR TRANSPORTATION FROM DONE A NUMBER OF THESE IN THE SAN JOSE AREA. BUT THEY'VE DONE A COUPLE OF. THROUGHOUT AND ALLOW IS A CITY OR COUNTY TO GO TO GO AND DO SOMETHING IT'S NOT GOING TO BE PERMANENT IT CAN BE CHANGEABLE. MAYBE IT MIGHT LAST YOUR A COUPLE YEARS AND GET MADE PERMANENT. IF IT'S SUCCESSFUL BUT IT ALLOWS PEOPLE TO LOOK AT WHAT THE RESULT THAT MIGHT BE SO WITH THAT AREAS WERE. INITIALLY BEEN. OUT FOR EXAMPLE. BURKE AND BUSINESSES SO BIZ DON'T WANT TO LOOSE PARKING FOR A BI WEEKLY. BUT WHEN THEY GET GET THE ACTOR TRANSPORTATION. THEY FIND THAT I HAS. IN CUSTOMERS SO THAT'S A QUICK BUILD PILOT HAS ALLOWED WOULD ALLOW SOMEOF THOSE TO TRY IT. TO SEE IF IT WORKS WE'RE NOT INVESTING AS MUCH MONEY MAKING PERMITS. AND IF WE FIND IT ISN'T SUCCESSFUL THEN WE CAN GO JUST TO. ANSWER THE QUESTION WHAT WOULD MAKE IT SUCCESSFUL. I UNDERSTOOD HOWEVER THAT. ARE TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR MATCHING FUNDS ON SOME OF THESE TWO HAD TO HAVE THAT AS A COMPONENT OF THE- JEFF. I DON'T KNOW IF. THE ACT. SHOP YOU KNOW I UNDERSTAND OF. THE FUND. I VISION IS FOR THE LOCAL. BUT IF IT FROM THAT A LOCAL HOUSE TO INCLUDE THE WHEN THEY'RE AT IMPROVEMENTS ON THE ARE. ARE THEIR PRIMARY THEIR LOW ROSA THEY HAVE TO SOME ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION COMPONENT OR THEY'RE NOT HIGH ON THE LIST OF PRIVATIZATION FOR MATCHING FUNDS YEAH I JUST SAY TAKE A LOOK AT THAT BECAUSE IT SEEMS TO BE ALMOST COMPETING. INTERESTS THERE SURE AND OUR LOCAL PARK PARTNERSHIP PROGRAM IT FUNDS A WIDE VARIETY OF PROJECTS- IT DOES NOT THE REQUIREMENT THEY HAVE TO HAVE AN ACTIVE. IN MAYBE THAT WOULD SOMETHING THAT NOT THANK YOU MISTER DIRECTOR. OUT SOONER I'LL JUST QUICKLY AT LIKE A. DIRECTOR WEISS ON THE ROLE ISSUE I'VE- STAKEHOLDER IN IT IS A- CRITICAL TO DO DOING THOSE TYPE OF PROJECTS- WE SHOULD MOVE FORWARD WITH A PROJECT IF A COMMUNITY OR THE SURROUNDING AREA SAY LOOK AT THIS ONE OUT THIS WILL BE SOMETHING WE WILL LIKE IN OUR COMMUNITY. BUT I THINK YOU TOUCHED SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT ABOUT. STAY AND DATA TO UP DECISIONS AND WE SHOULD DO MORE EVALUATING OF THAT. I'LL TELL YOU THAT THE NATIONAL STANDARDS AS IT RELATES TO THIS ISSUE ARE IF A ROAD HAS TWENTY THOUSAND VEHICLES LAST. TO BE TO PROVIDE WORK THAT YOU DON'T LOSE THE CAPACITY THEY'VE FROM OF LANE A TO MY PART LINE RATHER. THAT YOU DON'T MISTER LOSE CAPACITY SO HIGH. VOLUME ROAD WITH THIRTY VEHICLES AND YOU DO THAT YOU'RE GOING TO SEE SOME DETRIMENTAL IMPACTS- TO THAT PARTICULAR FOR SCHOOL FORTY NETWORK- BUT WE NEED TO EVACUATE MORE USED. OPTIONAL STANDARDS BUT I THINK. THREE THIS IS. BUT RIGHT THE NOT ONLY YOU THOSE MEASURE INSTEAD. THE BUT ALSO ANTI APPOINT EVALUATE BUT ALL MAKE SURE STAKEHOLDER ENGAGE AS A AS A PART OF THAT. THANK YOU FOR THAT IS YOU SEE REMAIN A CON. AYE OUT THE AND IF YOU FROM CA. AND IF IT'S NOT. IT IS SOME THAT SHE BE YOU KNOW. FROM OVERALL PLANNING OR A LONG TERM PLANNING BETTER LEAD AGAIN. GOES TO WHERE HE- THE MORE. FOR MORE. BEYOND WE'RE ALL POLITY OUTS. ONE FOCUSED ON LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. WE GOT A COUPLE PAID SHOOTERS FROM OUR PER PUBLISHED AGENDA. BECAUSE OF ILLNESS FIGHT CANCELLATIONS AND SO FOR THE. RONI VERTIGO IS GOING TO SPEAK WITH THE LEAGUE OF CITIES REPLACING RENEGE WHERE FROM THE CITY POMONA. AND KEEP DONE. WITH THE SELF CAL COUNTIES COALITION. PLACES AND SMITH WITH CINEMA TRANSPORTATION ASSOCIATION AND- WE STILL HAVE VETO I SEE YOU DOES IT SHOWS IS- OR STANISLAUS COUNTY SUPERVISOR AND- VIA HOW MANY YEARS DID YOU SERVE AS A C. SECTOR-LIMóN. JUST ONE YEAR VETO WAS A CHAIRMAN OF C. SACK. THERE WE STILL HAVE GORDAN GARDEN MCKAY IF WITH THE- PUBLIC WORKS DIRECTOR STOCKTON. AND JIM LAWSON'S HERE FROM MY COUNTY JIM LAWSON- HE'S- CHIEF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS SANTA CLARA COUNTY VALLEY TRANSPORTATION AGENCY SO I BELIEVE VETO YOU'RE GOING TO BE FIRST. SO IS THAT WHAT YOU GUYS FIGURE THAT OUT. OKAY THEATER. THE VETO IS FOR STIR WELCOME GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MIKE VON IS A THERE WE GO. A GOOD THE GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN MA'AM OF THE COMMITTEE. AS YOU SAID I'M OKAY I'M KERR SIR. ON THE STATE COUNTY BORDERS. I'M ALSO THE PRESS OF THE CALIFORNIA'S ASSOCIATION OF CAN. AND TESTIFYING TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE SET PRESENTABLE FOR EIGHT AND HE'S- AND I ALSO APPRECIATE THE- TO ADD SOME COMMENTS. I SEE SECOND COUNTIES KISA OF ONE. BECAUSE OF A RE IS THAT LOW ROAD. WERE TO BREAKING POINT. OVER 80% OF THE PLANE MILES A PUBLIC ROADS IN CALIFORNIA- ARE OWNED BY CITIES AND COUNTIES. THESE ROAD THE ONLY SER CARS BUT THEY'RE ALSO THE BACKBONE OF OUR PUBLIC TRANSIT SYSTEM. AND THE RIGHT AWAY FOR ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION PUTTING WALKING AND BIKING. SINCE TWO THOUSAND EIGHT CITIES IN QUE REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION POPULATIONS. TO GET TO THE A COMPREHENSIVE ASSESSMENT OF THE CAN. OF OUR LOW STREET AND ROADS. INTO THE SEVENTEEN COUNTIES WERE FACING THE IMPOSSIBLE CHOICES LIKE CANCELLING SIGNIFICANT- ROAD REHABILITATION PROJECTS OR ELIMINATING BASIC MAINTENANCE. CLEANING CULVERTS AND SEE WHAT THE CRACKS. WITHOUT NEW FUNDING THE LOCAL MAINTENANCE BACKLOG WOULD HAVE GROWN BY TWENTY BILLION DOLLARS OVER A DECADE REACHING NEARLY SIXTY BILLION DOLLARS BY TWO TWENTY SIX. PAVEMENT CONDITIONS WHEN IT BEGAN TO RAPIDLY DETERIORATE MORE THAN ONE OUT OF EVERY FIVE MILES OF LOCAL ROADS WHATEVER THEY FELT CAN INTENT THERE'S- HE TO PER OF THE LOCAL. NETWORK THAT THRESHOLD IS SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE FAILED- PAVEMENT- PAYMENTS MUST BE RECONSTRUCTED RECONSTRUCTION COSTS ARE EXPONENTIALLY HIGHER THAN MAINTAINING ROADWAYS IN GOOD CONDITION THAT'S WHY SB ONES FIX. I'M HERE TODAY TO TEST SB ONE HAS MEANT FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND AT THE START BY COMMENTING COMMENTING ON WHAT A DIFFERENCE TWO YEARS MAKES. THE FIRST FROM SB ONE FLOW TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IN FEBRUARY OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN. DURING THE FIRST TWO FISCAL YEARS OVER TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED LOCAL PROJECTS HAVE BEEN PROPOSED BY CITIES AND COUNTIES THIS REPRESENTS NEARLY THREE POINT FIVE BILLION IN PLANNED INVESTMENTS. EIGHTEEN TO THE PRIZE PLEADED STAY AS JUNE TWO THOUSAND. HE SAID THE LEAGUE AND A REPEAL A PARTNERS WILL BE SERVED LOCAL. IN MONTH TO UPDATE OUR WHY NEEDS IS ASSESSMENT FOR THE YEAR. THIS WILL BE THE FIRST NEEDS ASSESSMENT THAT CAN DEMONSTRATE THE IMPACT OF SB ONE FUNDING ON LOCAL ROADS AROUND THE STATE. MY COLLEAGUES FROM STOCKTON EMILY WILL PROVIDE ADDITIONAL DETAILS ABOUT OUR REMAINING NEEDS IN THE UPDATE ON THIS REPORT. IN THE MEANTIME- FROM EXAMPLES AROUND THE STATE THAT THESE FUNDS ARE FLOWING QUICKLY TO THEIR INTENDED PURPOSE. COUNTIES ARE MAKING SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS AND HAVE STARTED TO SHIFT AWAY FROM THE TRIAGE AND TOWARDS AN ASSET MANAGEMENT APPROACH. IN MY OWN COUNTY WE'VE USED SB FUNDS SB ONE FUNDS TO RESURFACE FIVE HUNDRED AND FOURTEEN MILES OF ROADS PROVIDE MATCHING FUNDS TO BRIDGES SEISMIC RETROFIT PROJECTS. AND ALSO A LOCAL BRIDGE FROM JECT OVER NEAR GEISHA AND DISTRICT CANAL. SB ONE BEEN TRANSFORMATIVE FOR MY COUNTY AND THE SAME IS TRUE FOR COUNTIES AROUND THE STATE. TO THE SEVENTEEN YOU WITH ME. WORLD COUNTY WAS COME A SENSE ZERO MILE OF. OVERLAYS PER YEAR WITH SB ONE THIS IS GROWING TO FIFTEEN OR TWENTY MILES EACH YEAR. IT DOESN'T SPEND TEAM MONTEREY COUNTY WAS FACED WITH DIFFERING SIGNIFICANT PAVEMENT REHABILITATION OBJECTS OR DRASTICALLY REDUCING. THE BASIC MAINTENANCE. THE CAMPAIGN HAS XCELERATED SIGNIFICANT PROJECTS INCLUDING FULL DEPTH RECLAMATION OF TWO MAJOR ROADWAY SEGMENTS ONE FIVE MILES LONG AND THREE POINT ONE MILES LONG. IN THE COUNTY MAINTENANCE WAS MINIMAL AND REACTIVE TO SPECIFIC TROUBLE SPOTS HOUSE THE TEAM. NOW SB ONE FOR THE MUSICAL MANNING A PRO MAIN APPROACH. SEND THE COUNTY IS ALSO THIS FOR. THE COUNTY INITIATED THE BUILDING BETTER ROADS WORKING GROUP TO IDENTIFY INNOVATIVE AND COST EFFECTIVE APPROACHES FOR ROAD RESURFACING EFFORTS. AS A RESULT OF THE EFFORTS THE SB ONE FUNDING OF AN SB ONE FUNDING THE COUNTY HAS TURNED AROUND FORMER DECLINING TREND IN THEIR PAY. CAN INDEX. IN FACT LOCAL SB ONE PROJECTS AROUND THE STATE IMPROVING SAFETY AND BENEFITING ALL MODES OF TRANSPORTATION. MONTEREY COUNTY SB WANT TO LEVERAGE FEDERAL BRIDGE IN SAFETY FUNDS FOR SEISMIC IMPROVEMENTS LIKE THE COUNTY WIDE SAFETY STRIPING PROGRAM. KERN COUNTY HAS MATCHED BACK TO TRANSPORTATION GRANTS WITH SB ONE DOLLARS THESE PROJECTS OF FOCUSED ON IMPROVING BICYCLE AND PEDESTRIAN ACCESS TO SCHOOLS AND PARKS ESPECIALLY IN DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. I JULY SAN DIEGO COUNTY WILL HAVE REPAIRED OR BUILT FIVE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SEVEN ACCESSIBLE CURB RAMPS FOR PEDESTRIAN AND PAINTED OVER FIFTY MILES OF BIKE LANES. IN ORANGE COUNTY FUNDS ARE BEING USED TO IMPROVE ACCESSIBILITY BY UPGRADING KERR BRANDS AND CLOSE SIDEWALK GAPS. THE IS ALL HELLO PRO ACTIVELY PURSUE BY IMPROVEMENTS THAT CAN BE ADDED TO FLOOD CONTROL CHANNELS ROADWAY PROJECTS. THESE PROJECTS WOULD DEPENDED ON. FUNDS SB ONE ALSO CREATED ON PUBLIC. EVERY COUNTY HAS REPORTED TO THEIR PLAN PROJECTS AN ACTUAL EXPENDITURES TO THE CALIFORNIA TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION IN ADDITION TO THE STATE'S ONLINE PORTAL COUNTIES ARE ENHANCING TRANSPARENCY AND LOCAL PLANNING PROCESSES SAN DIEGO COUNTY HAS BEEN A LEADER IN THIS AREA THE COUNTY HAS AN INTERACTIVE. AND YOU HAVE A HAND OUT YOU CAN LOOK AT THAT SHOWS THAT. FINALLY DESPITE ALL THIS PROGRESS LOCAL GOVERNMENT STILL HAS ON GOING NEEDS FIRST WE NEED STABILITY AND PREDICTABILITY FROM THE STATE. COUNTIES HAVE APPRECIATE THE LEADERSHIP OF CHAIRMAN BELL CHAIRMAN FRAZIER AND OTHERS HAVE WORKED HARD TO ENSURE THAT SB ONE. ARE ALLOCATED TO THEIR INTENDED PURPOSE WITHOUT DELAY. SECOND CITIES AND COUNTIES CONTINUE TO FACE SIGNIFICANT BRIDGE MAINTENANCE AND REPLACEMENT NEEDS. THESE PROJECTS ARE UNIQUE AS EVEN A SINGLE BRIDGE CAN TAKE UP TO SEVERAL YEARS WORTH OF ROAD MAINTENANCE FUNDING FOR A SMALLER EIGHT. THIRD WE MUST NEED TO STREAMLINE OUR ENVIRONMENTAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESSES TO MORE QUICKLY DELIVER MAINTENANCE READABLE BILLET TATIAN AND SAFETY PROJECTS. C. SECT TO THINK UNDER DOT FOR. LAST YEAR THIS IMPORTANT WILL HELP STREAMLINE LOCAL BRIDGE IN SAFETY PROJECTS- BUT THERE'S MUCH MORE THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE INCLUDING IMPLEMENTING SYKORA NEPA RECIPROCITY ONCE FEDERAL LEGISLATION IS FINALIZED. IF I COULD LEAVE IT WAS ONE LAST THOUGHT TELL YOU THE MAGNITUDE OF HOW MUCH IS HELP THEM YET HOW MUCH NEED IS OUT THERE STANISLAUS COUNTY WE- AND IN THE MONEY. GAS TAX FOR FIX IT FOR. TO MAINTAIN FOR OTHER AND FIFTY MY OF ROAD. TWO HUNDRED AND PER BRIDGES CULVER SIGN STOPLIGHTS EVERYTHING GOES WITH FOR TWELVE MILLION WE WERE FORCED AFTER A COUPLE ATTEMPTS TO PASS A SELF HELP. TAX WHICH BROUGHT IN ABOUT ANOTHER FOR. MILLION ISN'T. JUST ABOUT 50% TO OUR WHO. SB AS DOUBLE. THE TOTAL AMOUNT UP ABOUT THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR US SO IT'S COMPLETELY CHANGED THE COMPLEXITY HAVING SAID THAT WE ONLY EXPECT OUR REPAIR PAVEMENT MANAGEMENT INDEX OR- EFFICIENCY RATING. TO INCREASE BY TEN POINTS OF NEXT TEN YEARS SO IT'S STILL A LONG ROAD EVEN WITH ALL OF FLUX IN MY- A- WHERE IT WOULD. NO IS A IS A C. BY OR AS A CITY I THINK OF HIM MUCH OF THE SAME SO I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER THE QUESTIONS AT WELL MICHAEL HAVE GONE THANK YOU GET FOR THE TIME. THANK YOU VETO. FOR WORK AS TERM OF. THOSE WE SHOULD HAVE. A MCKAY IS SERVE WORK DIRECTOR FOR. STOP AND GO. OF I SAW EUROPE THE PRO WORKS. COMMUNITY AS- I TRY TO YOU HAVE THE FLOOR. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE PLANES GORDON OKAY PUBLIC OR DIRECTOR DIRECTOR THE CITY OF STOCK FOR THE PAST SEVEN YEARS. I'M ALSO THE OF THE PUBLIC WORKS OFFICER DEPART OF THE LEAGUE REPRESENT PUBLIC WORKS PROCESS. AS THE COURTS pPUBLIC WORKS DEPARTMENTS- ACROSS THE STATE ARE LEGALLY WHERE THE RUBBER MEETS THE ROAD WE STRIVE TO DELIVER CRITICAL. AND BILL SERVICES RESIDENTS EVERYDAY. ON A BRIEF NEW COUNCIL ON THE PUBLIC WORKS DEPARTMENT DOES- USUALLY I TELL THEM THAT. YOU'RE GONNA HEAR PROBABLY THREE THINGS FROM THE RESIDENTS. RESPECT TO PUBLIC WORKS IN A BE QUESTIONS ABOUT PAVEMENT. WE QUESTIONS ABOUT SIDEWALKS SB QUESTIONS ABOUT TREES AND THAT'S BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT'S IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE DOESN'T WHERE THEY LIVE WHAT THEY LOOK AT AND CARE ABOUT. PEOPLE EXPECT INTEREST. THREE MAINTAINED IN GOOD CONDITION. THE CHALLENGE FOR LOCAL DOT. AND STOCKED PARTICULARS FUNDING TO PRESERVE THESE LOCAL ROADS TRANSFERRED FUND IS- A MULTILAYERED PUZZLE SALES TAX TAX FEDERAL MONEY STATE MONEY BUT USUALLY ALLOCATED TO SPICE. THINGS UP MONEY TO THE FEDERAL EASTER A LOT OF THE LOW SO HELP CAN MONEY A DIRECT TOWARDS YOU ARTERIALS CAN JUST ENGINE. IN A CHUNKS TO TREAT BUT LITTLE MONEY I DISCRETIONARY BECAUSE OF IT FOR LOCAL ROAD ME. SO ALL OF OTHER USE ARE YOU KNOW IN VALLEY BUT IN IT BUT THE THAT IS A IN THE WHAT BUT THIS SINCE COMPLAIN OF AND WHAT THE OTHER IS BUT THE ROAD LOOKS THE LOCAL ROADS LOOK LIKE AND IS UNDER RONNIE WILL. IT'S FUN TO SEE ALL HOLD ALL TRIPS START AND END ON A LOCAL STREET. TRAFFIC SIGNAL MAINTENANCE STREET LIGHTS POWER BILLS FOR NINETEEN THOUSAND STREET LIGHTS THAT TYPE OF THING BASICALLY UTILIZED ALL OF OUR AVAILABLE. THERE WAS REALLY NO FUNDING AVAILABLE FOR PLANNED RESURFACING OR SIDEWALK WORK. SO THIS IS WHY SB ONE IN AND SPECIFICALLY MY POINT IS BECAUSE SB ONE O'CLOCK AND BOOKED UP THE ROAD MAINTENANCE AND REHABILITATION COUNTY MRP FUN THE CODE CITIES AND COUNTIES- IS TO CREATE- AS A MATTER OF INFUSION. HELLO THANKS TO SB EVERY CITIES TRêN BUDGET ESSENTIALLY ACROSS THE STATE AS WE GRAPPLE WITH A FUNDING SHORTFALL THAT WE ESTIMATED BE APPROXIMATELY SEVENTY BILLION DOLLARS. SO ACCORDING TO OUR LOCAL STREETS AND ROADS- FROM. NEEDS ASSESSMENT. THAT WE CONDUCT EVERY YEAR SB ONE SHRINK THE FUNDING SHORTFALL BY BUT EIGHTEEN BILLION DOLLARS OVER THE OVER THE TIMES OF THE OF THE TEN YEAR PRO. INDUSTRY IT'S CLEAR THAT IT'S AN IMPORTANT PART OF. FUNDING PUZZLE IT'S NOT THE ONLY PIECE AND IT ALONE WILL NOT SOLVE ALL OUR PROBLEMS ARE ADDRESS HOLD NEEDS INFRASTRUCTURE MAINTENANCE. YOU'RE WELL AWARE SIX. EVEN WITH SP ONE THE AVERAGE PAVEMENT CONDITION INDEX STATEWIDE FOR CITIES IS EXPECTED TO REMAIN AT APPROXIMATELY THE SIXTY FIVE OUT OF A HUNDRED RANGE THAT IT'S BEEN FOR SOME SOMETIME. THE REAL- IT. CITY IT IT IS IT LESSONS OR ELIMINATES THE DETERIORATION OF AN WHICH WAS TAPPING FOR NUMBER. INSTEAD OF STOCKTON SB ONE IS TO MAKE AN IMPACT- IN THE FISCAL YEAR NINETEEN TWENTY WE EXPECT TO RECEIVE ABOUT FIVE POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS. AND IN NINE IN NINETEEN TWENTY RE FOUR POINT NINE MILLION. AND UTILIZING THE NINETEEN. WE DELIVERED ONE AND A HALF MILLION DOLLARS OF LOCAL ROAD RESURFACING AND THAT'S PRIMARILY PEEP AND PRESERVATION ACTIVITIES SUCH AS- SLURRY SHIELD A MICRO SERVICING WERE ABLE TO RESURFACE TWENTY MILES PAVEMENT. ROAD NETWORK OF SEVEN HUNDRED IF YOU CAN'T ACT. WELL THE PRODUCT OF ONE AND A HALF MILLION DOLLARS FOR- WILL SIDE WHAT. REPAIRS THAT ALLOWED US TO MAKE REPAIRS THAT HUNDRED NAY LOCATIONS INSTALL THIRD BAKER BROWN'S- AND WE ALSO UTILIZE THE FUNDING FOR OTHER SMALLER PROJECTS SUCH REPAIRING STREETLIGHTS THAT HAD BEEN SEVERELY DAMAGED AND- CUTTING CUTTING IN CORPORATE SIDEWALK REPLACEMENTS ABOUT FOUR EIGHT FIFTY OKAY. TO A- TERM DISPLACEMENT.PROJECTS USING NINETEEN TWENTY FUNDS WILL BE MULTI MILLION DOLLAR PROJECTS FOR ST RESURFACING MICRO SERVICING AND SERVICIOS PRIMARILY AND SIDEWALK REPAIRS. AS WELL AS SEVERAL PROJECTS TO REPAIR APARTMENTS AT SOME OF OUR- THE BRIDGES WHERE WHERE WE HAD SOME SORT UNDERTAKEN AND THEY'RE SERIOUS STRUCTURAL CONCERNS. BUT YOU CAN SEE FOR STOCKTON OUR USE OF THE ARM OR A SB ONE MONEY IS ALL ABOUT PAYMENT PRESERVATION ASIDE REPAIRS TO MAKE IMPROVEMENTS THAT LOCAL. RESIDENTS REALLY ARE ABOUT. TERMINATION THE PRICE WE'LL MAKE OUR STREETS SAFER LESS CONGESTED BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY WILL KEEP OUR NETWORK IN A GOOD STATE OF REPAIR WHICH IS WHAT. CITIZENS CARE ABOUT THE PROJECTS WOULD SIMPLY NOT EXIST WITHOUT SP ONE. THEIR EVIDENCE THAT THE FUNDS ARE BEING USED FOR THEIR INTENDED PURPOSES INCREASED. REPAIR WORK ON CITY ROADWAYS AND CSP COMMAND. IS VISIBLE MEASURABLE AND UNDENIABLE. THE FUTURE FOR STOP OR ANY OTHER CITY IN THE STATE THE MASSIVE BACKLOG OF BASIC MAINTENANCE WORK IT WILL BE CRITICALLY IMPORTANT TO ENSURE. CAN KIDS SO WE- THE NEED ROAD WORK. SB ONE WAS A LANDMARK INFRASTRUCTURE BILL THE TOOK A MAJORITY OF LET'S SUPERMAJORITY LEGISLATURE TO PASS AND THE WILL OF THE VOTERS AS YOUR WHERE ENSURING ASP AND FUNDS ARE NOT OR EVER A- THIS IS CHRIS ROADWAYS AND MAKE A TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM SAFER MORE EFFICIENT AND ULTIMATELY SUSCEPTIBLE SO I WOULD LIKE TO THANK.

FOR MORE THAN 80% OF CALIFORNIANS ROAD WORK- AND ARE AS GOING TO MENTION- WHERE EVERY TRIP- BEGINS AND ENDS- IN THIS STATE- FUNNY SHORTFALL- GORDON REALLY BOILS DOWN TO ONGOING FUNDING TO EXIT. BEATING THIRTY OR FOR PAYMENTS AT BILLION DOLLARS FOR SUCH COMPONENTS AND TWO AND A HALF BILLION DOLLARS FOR BRIDGES- OVER THE NEXT. EIGHT TO TEN YEARS- AND THAT'S WITH SB ONE. WELL PAYMENT AND BRIDGE WE NEED THAT FUNDING NEEDS ARE ARE FAIRLY STRAIGHTFORWARD TO THINK ABOUT- IT'S EASY YOU ARE FOR THE GENERAL PUBLIC TO FORGET ALL THE ADDITIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE. THAT'S TIED INTO OUR ROAD SYSTEM WHICH WE CALL CENTER COMPONENTS- THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE FOR CITY STREETS- THAT INCLUDE CURB RAMPS SIDEWALK STORM DRAINS- STREETLIGHTS TRAFFIC SIGNALS- AND SIDEWALKS- I MET I WATCHED READY UP NOT NOT TO MENTION DEDICATED BY. THANKS I'M- A GIRL. ENTER TRANSPORTATION UP. OUR NEXT LOOK AT YOU THE ROAD I NEED TO SAYS WILL BE TAKING A CLOSER LOOK AT THE GROWING FUNDING NEEDS FOR THESE TYPES OF THE CENTER COMPONENTS AND BRIDGES- LOCAL AGENCIES CALIFORNIA OWN OVER TWELVE THOUSAND BRIDGES- WE KNOW THAT EIGHT HUNDRED TWENTY NINE- OF THESE BRIDGES NEED TO BE REPLACED BY ANOTHER THING OVER EIGHT HUNDRED. M. WE- WARREN CAN BE HERE TODAY HE DID SHARE WITH ME HOW SB ONE HAS HELPED THE CITY POMONA SO FOR SB ONE ALLOCATION TO HELP PROMOTE A COMPLETE THE FOLLOWING PROJECTS- REPAIRING OF THIRTEEN STREET FOR TWO POINT THREE CENTER LANE MILES- WITH THE SEVEN. THOUSAND DOLLARS THAT THEY RECEIVED IN FISCAL YEAR TWENTY SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN- AND THE RE PAVING OF SIXTEEN STREETS OR FOR CENTER LINE MILES WITH THE POINT NINE MILLION DOLLARS. ONE FINE THAT CV.

FINALLY THE GOAL LINE CONSTRUCTION AUTHORITY WAS AWARDED NEARLY THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN- FROM THE TRANSIT AND INTERCITY RAIL CAPITAL- PROGRAM- THAT'S ANOTHER SB ONE FUNDED PROGRAM- TO FILL THE- FUNDING GAP TO EXTEND THE GOAL LINE- INTO THE CITY OF PALM. THAT'S A LOT WHICH IS A ONE IN MILLION OUR PRODUCT- THE TO BE CA. IN TWENTY TWENTY FIVE AND THE CITY HOPES THAT IT WILL SPUR MORE TRANSIT ORIENTED DEVELOPMENT- NEAR THE STATION- WHICH THE CITY BELIEVES WILL HELP- BENNETT- THE CITY'S ECONOMY. AMONG ALSO BELIEVE THAT THE COMBINATION OF THESE PROJECTS WILL CONTINUE MAKE A MEANINGFUL DIFFERENCE IN THEIR ABILITY TO- PROACTIVELY ADDRESS PAVEMENT MANAGEMENT- LOOKING AT THEIR- CONDITION INDEX TRANSFER TWENTY THIRTEEN TO TODAY- THEIR NETWORK. THEIR PC WENT FROM. WENT FROM SIXTH FLOOR FROM SIXTY FIVE POINT THREE IN TWENTY THIRTEEN TO SIXTY EIGHT POINT ONE I'M AS OF LAST MONTH WHEN IT WAS LAST MEASURED SO- THREE POINT DIFFERENCE- IN A SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME- AND- AND- YOU KNOW. RIGOR OUR FROM CITY POMONA- DID MANAGE TO ME THAT THAT WAS MOSTLY RUBLE TO SB WHAT FUNDS. YOU WANT. JUST TWO AND A HALF MILLION DOLLAR. I TO THIS MONESSEN THE ROAD MINUTES RIVER PROGRAM STANDS AT ABOUT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY- THANKS SB ONE. ALSO JUST WANTED TO POINT OUT THAT THE LEGACY SAQIB ALSO JOINED IN PARTNERSHIP WITH SIX ACADEMIC INSTITUTIONS- TO CREATE THE CITY COUNTY PAVEMENT IMPROVEMENTS CENTER OUR PARTNERSHIP INCLUDES UC DAVIS UC BERKELEY SELLS A STATE CAL STATE LONG BEACH A CSU CHICO CAL WELL. THE PURPOSE OF THE TRAINERS TO MAKE LOCAL PAYMENT NETWORKS LAST LONGER COST LESS- AND ULTIMATELY BE MORE SUSTAINABLE- THE- ALREADY OFFERS TRAINING COURSES THAT OFFER REAL WORLD BENEFITS TO SITTING COUNTY ENGINEERS THAT ARE IN THE FIELD- WILDS TOO EARLY TO TELL WE HOPE THAT THE CENTER- PROVIDES ANOTHER STABILIZING FACTOR- TO THE INVESTMENTS THAT WE ARE MAKING IN OUR LOCAL STREETS AND ROADS NETWORKS ESCORT. THE POOR FOR THEIR IN FUNDS ARE FOR ALL CITIES TO CARRY OUT THERE I MEAN IT'S WORKS- THAT CITIES ARE MAKING PROGRESS IN THIS MASSIVE BACKLOG- AND THEY PLAN TO KEEP THEIR PROMISES TO THE RESIDENTS.

STATIONS I'VE HAD THE GOOD FOR TUNE TO BEING IN THE ROLE THAT I AM HERE TODAY IS EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF SOFTBALL CANNONS FROM MOST TEN YEARS. AND WE'VE SEEN. A DOWN A TRANSPORTATION FUNDING.

WELCOME COLLECTIVELY WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO BE INNOVATIVE WITH SUFFICIENT PROJECT DELIVERY MAKE SURE THAT WE MINIMIZE BLACKER SEES AND NOT BUILD UPON THEM INNOVATIONS IN PROJECT DELIVERY THAT WAS MENTIONED ON THE FIRST PANELS FAR DESIGN BUILD G. C. BUT- TECHNOLOGY. MAN TO MAN INCENTIVIZE BEHAVE. BUILDERS IN C. EFFORTS TOWARD ADVANCE MITIGATION ALL OPPORTUNITIES WERE MAKES SENSE SHOULD BE AVAILABLE TO LOCAL PROJECTS SPONSORS.

WE'RE INCREASING MARKET IT WOULD REST WITH LOCK AND WE'RE MAKING MEANINGFUL INVESTMENTS IN PROJECTS THAT IMPROVE SAFETY AND REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. IT'S NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE OVERSTATE HOW MANY DIFFERENTSURFACE TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS AND PROGRAMS ARE IMPACTED BY SB ONE TODAY I HOPE TO HIGHLIGHT SEVERAL OF THE WAYS IN WHICH SB ONE IS IMPROVED CALIFORNIA'S PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION NETWORK. FIRST SB ONE PROVIDES ROUGHLY THREE HUNDRED MILLION ANNUALLY IN NEW FUNDING TO THE STATE TRANSIT IS SYSTEMS PROGRAM. THAT PROGRAM THIS STA IS THE LIFEBLOOD OF PUBLIC TRANSIT IN FUNDS AND CAPITAL PURCHASES AS WELL AS OPERATIONS. WITH SB ONE FUNDS TRANSIT AGENCIES ACROSS ACROSS THE STATE TO BEEN ABLE TO AVOID SERVICE CUTS AND FARE INCREASES IN SOME CASES WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO EXPAND SERVICE AND PROVIDE PARKING TO DISCOUNTS TO TRANSIT RIDERS. SB ONE ALSO PROVIDES MORE THAN A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR STATE OF GOOD REPAIR PROJECTS THAT IMPROVE SERVICE BY ABILITY INCREASE SAFETY FOR THE TRAVELING PUBLIC. THE ONE. COUPLE FOR THE STATE'S TRANSPORTATION INTERCITY RAIL CAPITAL PROGRAM. WITH THAT FUNDING CALIFORNIA'S STATE TRANSPORTATION AGENCIES BEEN ABLE TO ESTABLISH A MULTI YEAR PROGRAM OF PROJECTS WILL TRANSFORM HOW CALIFORNIANS TRAVEL. THAT PROGRAM THOSE PROGRAM OF PROJECTS APPROVED IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN INCLUDES. SEVERAL OTHERS I DID WANT TO JUST STOP AND MENTION HOW IMPORTANT SENATOR IN U. POINTED THIS OUT EARLIER.

FUNDS THE CONSTRUCTION OF EXPRESS LANES STUDENTS WANT ONE MISTER CHAIRMAN I. FIFTY THREE I HAVE A QUICK QUESTION AND I. HAVE THAT I HAVE ANOTHER COMMITTEE AFTER THE YOU NEED TO BE AT WHAT I LIKE I'VE BEEN IN AWHILE. IN BETWEEN MEETINGS AT MY OFFICE. MR THE FOR THANK TO UP I KNOW OF BE REPRESENT THE FIRST IS DISTRICT WHICH IS VERY WERE WIDE OPEN I HAVE SOME SELF HELP VERY LITTLE- IN IN OUR AREA BUT SO AND I WAS ON THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS FOR SIXTEEN YEARS AND WAS PART OF A FOR TAKING WE DIDN'T LOG SO WE- ASK. IS THAT WE TALK ABOUT AT I'M HERE IS. PART OF MONEY ON TOP ALREADY TACK GAL. OF FUEL THAT WENT IN OUR ROADS SO MY QUESTION IS THAT SO WE HAVE- I I'VE BEEN LISTENING AND TRYING TO FOLLOW ALONG MOST THE PROJECT ARE IN. POPULATED HERE AS I KNOW I'M OUT IN WHAT WE SHOP SHOP PROJECTS- THAT ARE ONGOING IN THE- THEY QUALIFY I THE WEATHER SAFETY THERE'S BEEN SO MANY ACCIDENTS OR DEATHS RATCHET THOSE UP FOR THE A GOOD PART OF THE SENATE TREAT THERE ARE THERE ARE THERE TRANSPORTATION TRANSPORTATION ARTERIES- FREIGHT AND- TYPE OF THINGS THAT COME THROUGH OUR DISTRICT. EITHER ALL THE WAY TO DIFFERENCES- AIR UP THE PORTS TO THE MIDDLE OF THE COUNTRY- ALSO UP TO THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST SO MY QUESTION IS. SB ONE DEFINED ONLY CERTAIN THINGS THAT THE MONEY COULD BE SPENT ON LIKE WEEK WE COULD WE COULD DO A DIFFERENT MODES BUT WE COULDN'T PLAY WIDEN ROADS OR OR DO SO AT THE REGIONAL POTS OF MONEY THAT CAME IN SO THERE SHOULD BE POTS THERE SHOULD BE THE POP THAT. THE WOMAN IS. AND THEN THE- BILL. TAX BASE. TO COVER THE TACK WE WANT TO SEE FIT BACHARACH. I WOULD DEFER TO OUR BUT I THINK WHAT WE WANT IS PROBABLY A LITTLE TOO BROAD. WELL MY POINT IS MAYBE A LITTLE BROAD BUT MY WHAT I'M GETTING AT HERE IS THAT I'VE I'VE HEARD A LOT OF TALK ABOUT WHAT SB ONE ALLOWS US TO DO BUT I'VE NOT HEARD ABOUT THE OTHER PARTS OF IT WERE FUNDS THAT WERE ACTUALLY THERE BEFORE. BECAUSE THEY'RE MORE BROAD SO FOR ME I WANT TO LOOK AT THE ABILITY THIS IS MIKE WHAT I'M TRYING TO GET AT IS THAT. SOME UNLIMITED. I THINK ON SB ONE. ART IS HELPFUL US AS THE OTHER PARTS WERE IN IF WE MARRY THOSE TOGETHER TAKE THE POT OF SB ONE AND MEET THE DEMANDS THAT IT ARE THE GUIDELINES WITHIN AND THE TAKE THE OTHER PARTS. AND BE ABLE TO BACKFILL TO HELP. MAKE THE PROJECTS YOU BETTER. OKAY THERE WERE SOME. I HAVE A CHART IN MY OFFICE. SO THE SHOWS THE TRANSPORTATION FUNDING IN CALIFORNIA. IT IT'S ABOUT FOUR FEET WIDE BY ABOUT FIVE FEET LONG. URGED BUT- BUT A SEPARATE I CAN SIMPLIFY IT THERE THERE'S- LOCAL GAS TAX FROM THE STATE AND THEN THERE'S A FEDERAL GAS TAX THAT'S BEEN HISTORICAL WE GET. ONE POT MONEY WE ALSO GET DIESEL FUEL TAXES WE GET TO A- REVENUE FROM MAYBE SOME OTHER SOURCES THE LOCAL SELF HELP COUNTIES THERE POTS OF MONEY- OF. MONEY COMBINED GOES INTO THE STATE HIGHWAY COUNTY. THE COUNTY WANT TO LOOK AT YOUR YOUR QUESTION CHARLIE OF IS REGARDING STATE I WOULD CAL STATE HIGHWAY ACCOUNT ALLOCATED TO. GENERALLY THINGS OF STILL UP PROJECTS THAT'S A NEW ONE NEW PROJECT- WIDENING OR AN INTERCHANGE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT THEN YOU HAVE THE SHOP. SHOP IS THE ROAD MAY KNOW A ROAD REPAIRS AND THEN JUST RE SERVICE SAYING KIND OF ROAD MAINTENANCE KINDS OF ACTIVITIES SO THOSE ARE THE- THOSE ARE THE THREE. SOME MONEY NOW THE STEP PROJECTS THE THERE'S BEEN LESS AND LESS EACH YEAR OKAY THE REASON WHY IS BECAUSE MORE AND MORE HAD TO BE SPENT ON. THE SHOP IN THE MAINTENANCE PART BECAUSE THAT'S THE STATE HIGHWAY NOW THE GAS TAX ALSO GETS SUBVENTION. TO YOU WHEN YOU WERE COUNTY SUPERVISOR GOES BY A FORMULA. THE FORMULA GOES TO THE COUNTIES AND THEN BY FORMAL IT GOES TO THE CITIES THE GAS TAX IS GOVERNED BY ARTICLE NINETEEN OF THE CONSTITUTION COULD ALWAYS BEEN A ROAD ROAD TRIP FOR TATIAN A REPAIR THERE'S- ARTICLE IN THE STATE CONSTITUTION SO THE MONEY WOULD GO TO. ZERO IN HIS GROUP CORD IN RONI AND HIS GROUP IN TERMS OF THE ANNUAL BUDGETS DAD DAY WOULD ADOPT EVERY YEAR AND YOU WILL ALLOCATED BASED ON. WHAT YOUR NEEDS ARE SO THAT'S- THAT'S THOSE ARE THE TWO PARTS OF THAT'S WHERE THE GAS TAX GOES SO WHAT PART OF THE GASKET CLOSE TO THE STATE. AND PART OF THE BIGGEST AS GOES TO COUNTIES IN A PART OF THE GA TAX GOES TO CITIES AND TOWNS. ALL RIGHT WELL A PERSON THAT I. SAT THROUGH THIS STEP PROCESS IS YOU KNOW LOBBY NO PARTY TO IT PAST PRISON MUST LIVE TO GET WHAT I'M TRYING TO GET DONE BUT MY POINT IS. I WANT TO TIE THIS IS SOMETHING WE HAVE SB ONE WHICH IS AYE AYE MORE NARROW. AS FAR AS IS. ME FIXING REAP ROADS AND WE HAVE. THE OTHER PARTS OF MONEY IN THE WE HAVE SELF HELP WE HAVE ALL THESE OTHER PARTS. WERE THREE MILLION HOME SHORT IN CALIFORNIA. AND WHAT DO WE HAVE IN MY COUNTY YEP TO LEVY TAXES OR TALK ABOUT LEFT INTACT THE BILL THE INFRASTRUCTURE TO PUT THE HOMES IT. MY QUESTION IS TRY TO FIGURE OUT THE OTHER. THAT NOT NOT AS RESTRICTED AS SB ONE FUNDS. I WANT TO KIND OF FIGURE OUT IF THERE'S A WAY WE CAN MAKE AN AXIS SO I CAN GET SOME HELP TO MY COMMUNITY SO THEY CAN PUT THE INFRASTRUCTURE AND WE NEED. TO ALLEVIATE THE CONGESTION SO WE CAN BUILD HOUSES THAT'S REALLY WERE I THINK THIS TIES TOGETHER AND IN MY COMMUNITIES. WE DON'T HAVE MASS TRANSIT AND WE WERE NEVER GOING TO HAVE IT ALL RIGHT WE DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY LIKE SB FIFTY WHICH FAILED. IF WE CAN GET THERE. IN WHICH WOULD MAKE SENSE TO ME RIGHT FOR GOING TO HOUSING WE SHOULD PUT IT BY WHERE WE HAVE TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE AND- JOBS. SO I GUESS MY POINT IS I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT THE MONEY. GAME AND- FIGURE OUT WHICH POTS I NEED TO GO AFTER TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN SO THAT'S WHAT MY QUESTION WAS I KNOW THAT- LIKE YOU MISTER DON. DOES SELF HELP COUNTIES AND YOU KNOW MY COUNTIES ARE BEING. OUT THEY WE ALL PAY INTO THESE. WE ALL PAY TAXES WHO USE THESE SYSTEMS. I MEAN. I KNOW ABOUT THAT. THIS IS A GALLON FOR FUEL I'M A TRUCKING BUSINESS I UNDERSTAND IT. CHECK THE ROADS WE HAVE A BILLION DOLLARS. IN THE. I CAN'T THINK OF IT THE HEAVY WEIGHT USE TAX THAT'S NOT GOING INTO THE TO HIGHWAYS IT'S STILL GOING TO BE IN GENERAL FUND RIGHT WHICH IS WRONG UP ON. ONCE OKAY BRITISH BONDS ALL RIGHT WELL. ANYWAY MY QUESTION IS I'D LIKE TO FIND OTHER SPONSORS SO WE CAN POLITICALLY FIX SOME OF THESE. SOME OF THESE CONGESTION ISSUES WE HAVE ALONG WITH NOT ADDING MORE DEBT AND TAXES ON TO MY LOCAL COMMUNITIES THAT ARE IN THOSE AREAS WHERE THEY HAVE MASS TRANSIT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN FOR INDULGING ME I'LL COME AND LOOK AT YOUR MAP IS FOUR FEET WIDE AND MAYBE WE CAN FIGURE OUT WHERE A SLICE THAT MONEY SHOULD GO. WELL THE RURAL COUNTIES. MAYBE VIEW YOU CAN COMMENT ON THIS THE REAL COUNTIES GET A LANE MILE ALLOCATION RIGHT TO GET. BASED ON- BASED BY REGISTRATION A CARS AND LANE MILES AND- SURFACED ON SERVICE I GO THAT'S THAT'S IT ALL. RIGHT IF. AND I DON'T WANT YOU TO WALK WITH THE SP ONE MONEY THE STRICTLY SAVANNAH DOWN THE TO THE CITIES AND COUNTIES HAVE VERY FEW RESTRICTIONS. FIX IT FIRST I MEAN WE'RE WE'RE SO FAR BEHIND IN REPAIRS. THAT WE- WE COULDN'T GET ENOUGH REGARDLESS I EXPLAIN THAT EARLIER ABOUT HOW MUCH WITH DOUBLE THE MONEY. THEY WERE STILL. MAKE IT AN END TO END OF THE ROAD. I DON'T DISAGREE WITH YOUR YOUR PREMISE TRYING TO MAKE IT. ALL THE MONEY MORE CUSTOM. WORD RAISE IT'S NOT. THE PLEDGE TO WORK. FORTUNATELY NO ONE OF THE THAT I GET A GET A GRAY STATE STATE HIGHWAY TO GO THE TURN OFF ONTO A- THE- LOCALS A ROAD YOU CAN DO WE GO. I MEAN I DRIVE ON THOSE ROW I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING IS A- AND BUT- ONE. FOR A VERY SMALL AMOUNT THESE OUT A LITTLE BIT ANY GET MUCH OUT OF IT IN MY OPINION. SO THEY WAIT THANK YOU FOR INDULGING ME THANK YOU THANK YOU SIR- OKAY. I A OF. QUESTION ABOUT SB ONE IN TERMS OF. ARE THERE ANY THINGS THAT WE NEED TO DO TO IMPROVE SB ONE KEEP DOT MENTIONED. THAT ONE ISSUE OTHER OTHER THINGS REGARDING- THE ABILITY TO FUND PROJECTS THAT USE A- SHOULD SHOULD BE ENTERS A REFORM. THAT WE NEED- IN WITH US THE ONE. TWO FOUR. YEAH SINCE YOU MENTION MY NAME I'LL JUST REITERATE THE ABILITY TO HAVE LOCAL AGENCIES TO DO YOU KNOW COMING FROM THEM HAVE DULY ELECTED BOARDS AND PUBLIC PARTICIPATION ALTHOUGH WE CAN DO TO REMOVE THE BUREAUCRACY FROM DELIVERING THAT MONEY TO THE LOCALS IS GOING TO HELP US- YOU KNOW PUT THAT MONEY TO WORK AND THEN AGAIN THERE'S A NUMBER OF TRIED AND TRUE METHODS THAT THE STATE HAS. BEEN WE HAVE A LOCAL AUTHORITY BILL BUT NOT. THEY'RE JUST SOME THINGS I THINK WE GET OUT OF OUR OWN AND WRECKING SAID WE HAVE PROFESSIONALS IN THE LOCAL LEVEL WHO NOT ONLY KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING BUT ALSO VERY QUALIFIED TO MAKE THOSE DECISIONS AND ALSO WILLING TO COME. REPORT TO YOU CDC AND OTHERS ABOUT THE PRIOR TO THAT I THINK THEY'LL GO A LONG WAY OF. REMOVING SOME OF THE LADIES AND USING THAT MONEY EFFECTIVELY THANK YOU CURTAIN YES I WOULD ADD FROM THE- CITIES PERSPECTIVE THAT. THE REPORTING OF THE OF THE PROJECTS THAT'S DONE EVERY YEAR I THINK IS A IS A REASONABLE AND VIABLE METHOD OF TRACKING WHAT'S DONE. AT THE CITY AND COUNTY LEVEL FOR ACCOUNTABILITY. THIS PROGRAM WHAT WE'RE PRIMARILY CONCERNED ABOUT IS. ANY FURTHER RESTRICTIONS THAT WOULD DELAY OR SOMEWHAT. CONTROL THE DID DISTRIBUTION OF THE FUNDS- SO. I WOULD SAY FROM FROM A FROM A PRIMARY PERSPECTIVE THE WAY IT'S SET UP RIGHT NOW WITH IT WELL. IT'S CERTAINLY FROM THE FROM THE- WOULD DELIVERING PRO FOR CITIZENS IT'S OF AN X. PROGRAM. THANK YOU. OKAY WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH PALACE WE HAVE ONE LAST SPEAKER- OF THE TRANSPORTATION CALIFORNIA ORGANIZATION IS SO COALITION OF BUSINESS LABOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS OF. THE SUPPORT TRANSPORTATION KIANA DINER EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR IS HERE TO SPEAK FOR US OF. AND WELCOME KIANA FOR. BEING THE LAST SPEAKER. THANK YOU. THEN YOU HAVE THE FLOOR AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR. STAFF MEMBERS OF THE AUDIENCE THAT ARE STILL HERE- IN THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE AT THIS AFTERNOON TO REPRESENT THE PARTITION INDUSTRIES EXPERIENCE WITH SB ONE TO DATE- I THINK THE SHORT STORY HEN ONE THAT HAS ALREADY BEEN TOLD WITH THE TESTIMONY PROVIDED THIS AFTERNOON. IS THAT S. ONE IS WORKING THE REBUILDING CALIFORNIA DOT CA DOT GOV WEBSITE THE STATE'S ONE STOP SHOP FOR SB ONE INFORMATION HAS NEARLY EIGHTY THOUSAND OBJECTS THAT HAVE BEEN FUNDED BY SB ONE. PROCESS THE CROSS STATE THERE ARE MULTIPLE ALL THE PROGRAM. AS A RESULT- CONTRACTORS ARE VERY BUSY AND MAN HOURS ARE AT HISTORIC HIGHS SO THE INDUSTRY IS FEELING THE POSITIVE BENEFITS OF SB ONE SHORTLY AFTER ITS PASSAGE THE AMERICAN ROAD AND TRANSPORTATION BUILDERS ASSOCIATION CONDUCTED AN ECONOMIC IMPACT ASSESSMENT OF WHAT SB ONE WOULD. MEAN FOR AT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IN THE STUDY CONCLUDED THAT THE BILL WOULD SUPPORT AT LEAST ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY TWO BILLION DOLLARS ECONOMIC ACTIVITY. AND BENEFITS TO CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS AND BUSINESSES- OVER A TEN YEAR THAT'S IT WAS A TEN YEAR STUDY PERIOD AND THAT TRANSLATES OVER SIXTY EIGHT THOUSAND JOBS A YEAR. AT SAID THE INDUSTRY FOR TO CONTINUE BEING THE CONTINUED OPPORTUNITY AFFORDED BY SB ONE. AT IMPROVE SAFETY MOBILITY OF OUR TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE AS WELL AS CREATE MIDDLE CLASS JOBS AND ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY. THE INDUSTRY IS ALSO COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH THE STATE LEGISLATURE AND THE ADMINISTRATION TO ENSURE SB ONE IS- IMPLEMENTED IN THE MOST EFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE WAY POSSIBLE. AND THAT THE PUBLIC IS AWARE OF THE BENEFITS OF SB ONE ON THEIR EVERYDAY LIFE. ADD TO THIS END- WHILE SB ONE INCLUDE SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY MEASURES WHICH WE'VE TALKED ABOUT AT LENGTH AFTERNOON WE THINK THERE IS ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT AND THAT'S WHY WE HAVE- STARTED TO WORK WITH. SUGGESTED BILL PROPOSED THAT WOULD INCREASE TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY- ESSENTIALLY WHAT WE'VE CONCLUDED AT IS A TRANSPORTATION POLICY PERCENT I KNOW WHERE ALL THE NUMBERS ARE I CAN DO SOME RESEARCH AND FIGURE OUT WHAT SB ONE IS FUNDING. BUT FOR THE AVERAGE PERSON- SOMEONE IN THE MEDIA. THAT INFORMATION IS NOT AS READILY AVAILABLE AS WE THINK IT SHOULD BE. AT SO OUR IDEAS THAT WE WOULD ASK THE STATE TO USE EXISTING SB ONE DATA AND PROD HIM FOR TEN YEARS EXISTING WEBSITE. TO JUST PRIDE THAT PROVIDE SOME MORE EASILY AND EFFECTIVE A CUMULATIVE DATA ON THE IMPACTS OF SB ONE AND- ABOUT IS ONE SUGGESTION WE WOULD. THAT MAKE THIS AFTERNOON TO ENSURE THAT JUST THE EVERYDAY PERSON WHO KNOWS THEY'RE PICKING THIS TAX WHEN THEY FILL UP AT THE PUMP IS GETTING. INSTEAD THE BENEFIT TANGIBLE. OF THAT TODAY WE ALSO THINK CONTINUE ALL PROACTIVE IN EASY TO UNDERSTAND EDUCATION AND OUTREACH. IS CRITICAL IN FACT I AM IN ORDER TO CONTINUE TO EDUCATE. VOTERS AND TAXPAYERS- SO FOR OUR PART THAT ISN'T JUST SOMETHING THAT WE WOULD RECOMMEND TO THE- TO THE LEGISLATURE WE BELIEVE THE INDUSTRY HAS A STAKE IN DOING. THAT SORT OF EDUCATION AND OUTREACH AS WELL. WE DEVELOPING A SUITE OF EDUCATIONAL DOCKET ON AT THE ONE INCLUDES A HUNDRED AND TWENTY. TRICKS ASSEMBLY AND SENATE DISTRICT FACT SHEETS AT TOP S.
