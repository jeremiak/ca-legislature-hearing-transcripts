THOSE YOU WERE WONDERING I SEE WE'RE ALL TRYING TO SOCIAL DISTANCE OF THAT'S A GOOD THING. EXCEPT IN THE FIRST ROW VERY VERY BAD. AND THEY HAVE A HEALTH PROGRAM TO GO FIGURE WE'LL GET TO THAT LATER. WE'LL GO AHEAD AND GET STARTED WE HAVE A PRETTY ROBUST AGENDA HERE'S SO WE'LL TRY TO MOVE THROUGH IT QUICKLY AND- MOVE YOU THROUGH THIS ROOM AND OUT OF THE CAPITAL LET'S GO AHEAD AND- TAKE OUR FIRST PANEL THIS IS- ITEM OF COURSE SIXTY FOUR FORTY UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA THE FIRST PANEL IS CAPITAL OUTLAY AND DEFERRED MAINTENANCE. ISSUE NUMBER ONE. YOU ALL OF THE TABLE WOULD INTRODUCE YOURSELVES FOR THE RECORD STARTING TO MY LEFT YOU'RE RIGHT SIR EUROPE READY CAST UPON A FINANCE. DECENT CONCENTRA SOLELY- NICE TO SEE YOU CAN NUMBER TO HIS IN GOOD TO SEE YOU AND YOU KNOW YOU'RE DOING THIS IN ORDER TO VERY GOOD VERY GOOD GOOD MORNING CENTER ROTH SAY OF BIRTH CANNON UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA I CAN TELL THIS IS EDUCATION YOU'RE ALL IN A ROW. OKAY ONE SISTER. FINANCE. THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY SENATOR ROTH. SO AGAIN READY CATS PART OF FINANCE REGARDING CAP OUT WAY. THIS IS A AND THIS ISSUES IN REGARDS TO THE ANNUAL CAPITAL OUTLAY- SUBMISSION AND DEFERRED MAINTENANCE- SO WE JUST WANT TO SAY THAT SO EACH YEAR YOU SEE SUBMITS TO US PROJECTS IN SEPTEMBER- AND THIS YEAR THERE IS EIGHTEEN PROJECTS THAT OLD FAMILIAR WAS LISTED. IN OUR FEBRUARY HAVE PRELIMINARY APPROVAL LETTER. AND THE LARGE MAJORITY OF THOSE ARE SEISMIC INNATE. AND THIS IS A PROCESS THAT WAS ESTABLISHED- IN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN FOURTEEN WITH AB NINETY FOUR WHICH ALLOWS YOU SEE TO USE A UP WITH THEIR SUPPORT APPROPRIATION IN ORDER TO SELL BONDS ARE PAID PAID THAT SERVICE ON BONDS TO FUND THESE PROJECTS. AS LONG AS IT DOESN'T EXCEED MORE THAN 15% OF THEIR NET SUPPORT BUT. SO FOR REFERENCE IT MIGHT HELP TO GO TO PAGE SIX OF YOUR AGENDA THAT LISTS ALL OF THE CAPITAL OUTLAY PROJECTS- IN THIS ITEM UP FOR CONSIDERATION. I'M AS THE MINISTRATION NOTED- AND YOU CAN SEE IN THE FIGURE MOST OF. THE PROJECTS ADDRESS CRITICAL LIFE SAFETY SEISMIC PROJECTS. I'M IN THERE A FEW OTHER PROJECTS IN ADDITION TO THAT- THE- UNIVERSITY'S OVERALL APPROACH OF EMPHASIZING SEISMIC LIFE SAFETY PROJECT SEEMS REASONABLE TO US WE DON'T HAVE CONCERNED WITH THAT OVERALL APPROACH. WE DO HAVE- THREE SPECIFIC CONCERNS AT ALL WALK THROUGH QUICKLY. ALL THE FIRST RELATES TO ALL THE PROPOSALS IN THIS FIGURE AND THAT IS THAT THE UNIVERSITY- IS GENERALLY REQUESTING A PRE AUTHORIZATION OF ALL OF THE PHASES OF. BOTH THE PLANNING PHASES AND CONSTRUCTION THIS IS SOMETHING THE UNIVERSITY REGULARLY REQUESTS FOR AND IN PREVIOUS YEARS THEY HAVE PROVIDED AUTHORIZATION FOR THESE PHASES. WE THINK A MORE INCREMENTAL APPROACH MAKES MORE SENSE APPROVING THE INITIAL PLANNING PHASES FIRST AND THEN HAVING UNIVERSITY COME BACK ON WHEN MORE INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE ON THE SCOPE OF THE CONSTRUCTION PHASE AND THEN AUTHORIZING THE CONSTRUCTION PHASE ONCE THAT INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE. IT'S APPROACH THAT THE STATE DOES TAKE FOR OTHER- AGENCIES LIKE THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES FOR EXAMPLE. I'M AND WE THINK THAT APPROACH GIVES A LEGISLATURE MORE INFORMATION ON THE SCOPE OF THAT PHASE ONCE MORE INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE. WE THINK THAT COULD BE HANDY EVEN IN CASES LIKE A SEISMIC RENOVATION THAT. ON PAPER OFTEN MORE STRAIGHTFORWARD THAN A- CONSTRUCTION PROJECT FOR EXAMPLE FOR SEVERAL OF THE SEISMIC RENOVATION PROJECTS- CAMPUSES IN THEIR PROPOSALS TO US NOTED THAT THERE STILL WHEN SOME OF THE SCOPING DECISIONS- FOR EXAMPLE A LOT OF THESE. BUILDINGS ARE CURRENTLY AT A LEVEL SIX WHICH IS THE SECOND THE WORST RATING YOU CAN HAVE FOR A SEISMIC. OFFER A BUILDING THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY THEY'RE THERE SOME EXCITEMENT PROJECTS THIS YEAR. IF YOU TURN TO PAGE FIVE YOU CAN SEE V. ARMED. A LEVEL THAT THE UNIVERSITY USES FOR SEISMIC READINGS. AND CURRENTLY THE PLAN IS TO GET AT LEAST TO A LEVEL FOUR WHICH IS THE- MINIMUM ACCEPTED STANDARD- OF FOR. FOR A CLASSROOM BUILDINGS AN ACADEMIC BUILDINGS. THE CAMPUS IS NOTED THAT THERE STILL WEIGHING THE OPTIONS OF TRYING TO RENOVATE TO A LEVEL THREE. AND THEY KNOW THAT THIS CAN OFTEN BE A COMPLEX ANALYSIS IT. ON THEIR THEIR HIGHER COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT THERE IS SOME BENEFITS SO THEY HAVE TO WEAR THOSE INDIVIDUALLY BY EACH PROJECT. THAT'S THE KIND OF INFORMATION WE THINK THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT WANT TO HAVE. AT THE READY BEFORE ALL THE FULLY AUTHORIZING THE CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS WE RECOMMEND. TAKING A MORE CURRENT INCREMENTAL APPROACH AUTHORIZING. THE INITIAL PLANNING PHASES FIRST. THIS IS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT HERE WITH THE UCAS OPPOSED TO. HAVING COME FROM BUDGETS OF FOUR WERE WE DEALT WITH THESE ON STATE CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS. OVER THE SIX YEARS THAT I HEAR THAT SUBCOMMITTEE A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT FROM YOU SEE IS AN AND THAT THEIR OWN BINDING BE UC'S BINDING CAPACITY IS THE- IS THE CAPACITY IS BEING. CHARGED WITH THE PROJECT CAN IN MOST IF NOT ALL CASES EXCEPT PERHAPS ONE. SERVED THE DEBT SERVICING IS BEING COVERED BY. YOU SEE ISN'T IT IN THESE PROJECTS. SO WHILE IT IS OUR FUNCTION TO PROVIDE OVERSIGHT AND CERTAINLY OUR FUNCTION TO IMPROVE AND WE SHOULD KNOW WHAT WE'RE APPROVING WHEN WE- TAKE A VOTE. THERE IS A LITTLE BIT OF A DIFFERENCE IN THESE PROJECT VIS A VIS THE OTHER PROJECTS AND OTHER GOVERNMENT AGENCIES. I EMBARK ON JUST BECAUSE OF THE ARCHITECTURE WITH WHICH THESE PROJECTS ARE STRUCTURED AND THEN FINANCED BRECHT. IT'S TRUE THAT YOU'RE YOU'RE CORRECT IN THAT THE PROCESS IS VERY DIFFERENT FROM OTHER- STATE AGENCIES ARE USING STATE BONDS THOSE. SO OFTEN REQUIRES AN APPROPRIATION IN THE BUDGET- THESE DON'T REQUIRE AN APPROPRIATION IN THE BUDGET. ON THEY'RE NOT USING STATE BONDS THEY'RE USING UC'S BONDS ON THEIR PAYING THE DEBT SERVICE WITH THEIR GENERAL FUND SUPPORT DOESN'T REQUIRE. YEAH WITHIN THE CAP THAT'S CORRECT DOESN'T REQUIRE A DIRECT APPROPRIATION FROM THE STATE OF THE STATE. SOMETIMES DOES ADJUST THEIR BUDGET TO SERVE REFLECT THESE AND OTHERS ARE COST INCREASES. WE STILL THINK AN INCREMENTAL APPROACH MAKES SENSE DESPITE THESE DIFFERENCES TO GIVE YOU SOME MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE SCOPE AND THEY'RE OPEN SOME PROJECTS WHERE WE HAVE TAKEN AN INCREMENTAL APPROACH. ON THERE WAS A PROJECT I FORGET WHICH CAMPUS IT WAS AND BUT THERE WAS A PROJECT- I THINK WAS AT SANTA CRUZ WHERE WE DID APPROVE THE INITIAL PLANNING PHASES AND THEN LATER THE CONSTRUCTION PHASE SO IT'S NOT AN UNPRECEDENTED TO TAKE FOR THESE KINDS OF PROJECTS WELL CERTAINLY WE EXPECTED. DUE DILIGENCE IN A FAIRLY DETAILED AMOUNT OF PLANNING TO GO INTO THIS AND YOU'RE RIGHT WE IT'S OUR JOB TO MAKE SURE THAT OCCURS BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE DAY. THE STATE GENERAL FUND MAY BE THE BACKSTOP. THAT'S CORRECT IF THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT ERROR YEAH I DIDN'T MEAN TO CUT YOU OFF THAT'S OKAY I CAN I AM HAPPY TO WALK THROUGH SO WITH THAT WAS OUR FIRST KIND OF BROAD COMMENT WE HAVE TWO MORE. I'M OUR SECOND SET OF CONCERNS RELATE TO THE PROPOSAL OF THE PROJECT- IN LINE SEVENTEEN WHICH IS AS I'M SORRY ON PAGE SIX AGAIN. WHICH IS A STAR SYSTEM WIDE- BUT VERY PLANNING ACTIVITIES- IT'S AN EIGHTY MILLION DOLLAR BONTA FORTY THERE AND YOU'RE REALLY LOOKING UT A NUMBER OF A VERY PROPOSALS IN THIS ITEM FIFTY MILLION OF THIS WOULD FUND THE INITIAL PLANNING PHASES OF SEVERAL PROJECTS OTHERS PROJECTS ARE ACTUALLY SUMMARIZED INTERNET SIR TO FLIP AROUND A LOT BUT ON PAGE SEVEN YOU CAN SEE THE LIST OF THOSE PROJECTS. I'M AN ORPHAN ABOUT ARE YOU CONCERNED HERE'S JUST. PUZZLES CAME FAIRLY LATE I'M IN THE PROPOSALS WERE SOMEWHAT INCOMPLETE. THEY DIDN'T CONTAIN A LOT OF INFORMATION YOU WE NORMALLY GET ENOUGH CAPITAL OUTLAY PROPOSAL THINGS LIKE A FULL. DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT JUSTIFICATION- ALTERNATIVES THAT WERE CONSIDERED. AN INITIAL- ESTIMATED TIME LINE INITIAL ESTIMATED CONSTRUCTION COSTS. ON SO WE JUST DON'T HAVE ENOUGH INFORMATION TO. ASSESS THE MERITS OF THESE PROPOSALS WERE GIVEN THE- I WILL SAY APPARENT DEMISE OF THE PROP SIX PROP THIRTEEN. CONSTRUCTION BOND STATEWIDE BOND WHAT IMPACT ASSUMING THAT IS IN FACT THE WHAT HAPPENS WHAT IMPACT WILL THAT HAVE ON THE PARTICULAR THIS PARTICULAR ITEM THE EIGHTY MILLION- FOR PLANNING ACTIVITY OTHER THIRTY GOOD QUESTION FOR THE UNIVERSITY IN TE ADMINISTRATION THEY THEY HAD COMMUNICATED TO US THAT THEIR INITIAL PLAN WAS TO USE UP ON TO FUND THE LATER PHASES. ANOTHER TOP ON DOESN'T APPEAR THAT IT WILL PASS- BUT IT'S KIND OF AN OPEN QUESTION IN OUR MIND- WHAT THE PLAN WOULD BE THE PRESUMABLY THE UNIVERSITY COULD STILL CONTINUE TO USE THEIR BONDS AND AFTER FROM THE FUTURE COSTS BUT THAT WOULD BE A GOOD THING TO EXPLORE WITH THE UNIVERSITY. I'M JUST ON THAT SO IT THERE WAS FIFTY MILLION THERE'S ANOTHER THIRTY MILLION IN THAT PROPOSAL AND THAT IS FOR A SEPARATE- INITIATIVE THAT WOULD FUND. ODDS ADDITIONAL SEISMIC STUDIES FOR BUILDINGS ONLY THE UNIVERSITY HAS TAKEN NUMEROUS SEISMIC STUDIES WITH ITS EXISTING BUDGET ARM AND THE THESE ARE STANDING IS THAT THESE STUDIES APPEALED IT MORE IN DEPTH AND WOULD HELP- FURTHER DETERMINE THE SEISMIC READINGS IN CASES WHERE THERE ARE SOME WORDS STILL AMBIGUOUS USING STANDARD METHODOLOGY. MY UNDERSTANDING THERE'S SOME ISSUE ABOUT. CAMPUS IS DOING STUDIES BUT THE QUESTION WAS IS WAS THE METHODOLOGIES. STANDARDIZED IN OR THE RESULT A ROOF COMPARING APPLES TO APPLES AND- APPLES TO ORANGES YEAH THAT WAS NOT REMEMBERING THE IS YEAH THAT THERE WAS AN ISSUE FOR MAINTENANCE PARTICULARLY THEY WERE SOMETHING UNIVERSITIES CURRENTLY UNDERTAKING A SYSTEM WIDE STUDY OF. THE CONDITION OF ITS FACILITIES THAT AND WITH THE AIM OF HAVING A MORE ACCURATE ESTIMATE OF THEIR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE BACKLOG. THESE STUDIES ARE ACTUALLY SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT THEY'RE FOCUSED ON SEISMIC STRUCTURES FOR BUILDINGS AND SO THEY'RE LOOKING AT THEIR ABILITY TO WITHSTAND SEISMIC FORCES. ON THEY'VE CURRENTLY DONE A NUMBER OF OBSERVATIONAL STUDIES WHICH IN A LOT OF CASES IS. ON BUT IN SOME CASES NOT ON THESE STUDIES ARE A LITTLE BIT MORE QUANTITATIVE AND- ARE A LITTLE MORE HANDS ON REQUIRE A LITTLE BIT MORE DETAIL AND SO THAT'S- THAT'S OUR UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THE PURPOSE OF THESE STUDIES ARE. WE DON'T TAKE ISSUE WITH THE WITH THE GOAL OF THE STUDIES- OUR CONCERN HERE IS THAT IT'S A- ONE TIME STUDY AND AS YOU'VE HEARD US. COMMENT BEFORE WE THINK BONDS ARE NOT THE APPROPRIATE FOR A ONE TIME STUDY I AGREE WITH WE THINK CASH WOULD BE A BETTER ALTERNATIVE WE ALSO KNOW THAT THE UNIVERSITY HAS. BEEN APPEAR. APPEARS TO BE USING ITS EXISTING BUDGET FOR A LOT OF THE STUDIES ALSO HAS. A RESERVES AND SO WE THINK THOSE WOULD PROBABLY BE BETTER- FUND SOURCES THEN- BOND FUNDING. SO WE RECOMMEND YOU REJECT- THIS EIGHTY MILLION DOLLAR PROPOSAL ONCE ENTIRETY. THAT BEING SAID IT'S NOT THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY SIGNALING THE PRODUCTS DON'T HAPPEN IT'S JUST SIGNALING EITHER THAT THE UNIVERSITY COME BACK WITH. MORE INFORMATION WERE COMPLETED- PROPOSALS OR THAT IT USE EXISTING RESOURCES IN THE CASE OF THE SEISMIC STUDIES FOR WE- SUPPLEMENT THE GENERAL FUND. APPROPRIATION BY THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS TO MAKE SURE THE SEISMIC STUDIES DONE STEP THAT'S THAT'S ANOTHER OPTION THERE WOULD BE ONE TIME IN THAT CASE AND PRESUMABLY INSTEAD OF ON GOING DEPENDING ON. THE NATURE OF THE STUDIES SEISMIC STUDY WOULD BE PRETTY IMPORTANT TO. PAYING FOR TO ANOTHER ISSUE BUT WE CERTAINLY NEED TO KNOW WHAT WE NEED TO QUANTIFY WHAT THE SCOPE OF THE PROBLEM IS AND THEN FIGURE OUT EVER GOING TO PAY FOR THIS. AND YOU MIGHT RECALL LAST YEAR THE STATE. ADOPTED SUPPLEMENTAL REPORTING LANGUAGE REQUIRING YOU SEE TO. COME COME BACK WITH AN ESTIMATE OF IT SEISMIC. READINGS AND SO IT'S AN ACTIVITY THAT UC'S DOING IN. CONJUNCTION WITH EXPECTATIONS SET BY THE STATE RIGHT. AND THEN JUST THAT THE THIRD SET OF CONCERNS ARE WILL BE SIMPLER JUST ONLINE SIXTEEN ON PAGE SIX YOU'LL SEE. A PROPOSAL FOR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE. WE JUST RECOMMEND YOU GET AN INITIAL LESS BEFORE AUTHORIZING- BOND FUNDING FOR THAT WE DON'T HAVE INITIAL LIST AT THE MOMENT. THE PROJECTS. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR. NICE ANALYSIS YES MA'AM. THANK YOU CENTER ROTH AND CENTER LEYVA- I WOULD FIRST BEFORE I BEGIN I WOULD LIKE THANK THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR FOR PLACING THE GENERAL OBLIGATION BOND ON THE BALLOT ABOUT A WEEK AGO. WHILE IT'S LOOKING LIKE PROP THIRTEEN DIDN'T PASS WE REALLY APPRECIATE THE LEGISLATURE'S TECH KNOWLEDGE MEN OF UNIVERSITIES. SIGNIFICANT CAPITAL OUTLAY NEEDS AND YOUR SUPPORT FOR US- THE SERGEANT I BELIEVE HAS HANDED OUT- OF PRESENTATION THAT HAS AN ORANGE COVER ON IT- I'LL BE REFERRING TO SLIDE THREE THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BOARD OF REGENTS IS REQUESTING CAPITAL OUTLAY PROJECTS FUNDED THROUGH THE A. B. NINETY FOUR PROCESS. OF AND AS THE LA ON DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE EXPLAINED- UNDER THE AB NINETY FOUR PROCESS YOU SEE ISSUES BONDS THAT ARE PAID FROM OUR OWN OPERATING FUNDS. AND ON SLIDE THREE YOU SEE THE PROJECTS THAT ARE- PROPOSED TO BE FUNDED DURING TWENTY TWENTY ONE. OF THE TOTAL ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED FORTY FOUR MILLION IN STATE FUNDS AND- AND WE WOULD FOCUS ON ADDING SYSTEM WIDE EDUCATIONAL CAPACITY AND LIFE SAFETY ISSUES- AS THE LA MENTIONED- YOU SEE HAS BEEN. CONDUCTING EXTENSIVE SEISMIC EVALUATION OF OUR BUILDINGS TO DATE WE HAVE EVALUATED OVER FIFTY SIX MILLION SQUARE FEET OF BUILDINGS. OF IDENTIFIED FOR THE PROJECTS IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE WE HAVE FOURTEEN BUILDINGS IN CREEK NEED OF CRITICAL REPAIR THAT ARE CONSIDERED SEISMIC SAFETY SIX. UP BUILDINGS. AND WE ARE ALSO OF REQUESTING FUNDING FOR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE WE HAVE SUBMITTED TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND THE A JOINT LEGISLATIVE BUDGET COMMITTEE A LIST OF DEFERRED MAINTENANCE PROJECTS TOTALING SIX BILLION DOLLARS CROSS OUR CAMPUSES WE WOULD SELECT ALL OF THE PROJECTS FROM THAT LIST. AND WE WOULD DIVIDE THE FUNDS BETWEEN THE CAMPUS IS BASED ON THE AGE OF THE BUILDINGS AND THE SQUARE FOOTAGE OF THE BUILDINGS ON THE CAMPUS WHICH IS A FORMULA THAT WE'VE USED IN THE PAST. IN DIVIDING ARE A DEFERRED MAINTENANCE FUNDS BETWEEN OUR CAMPUSES. IN ADDITION WE'RE REQUESTING ANOTHER FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IN ONE TIME STATE GENERAL FUNDS FROM THE LEGISLATURE FOR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE PURPOSES. HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION OF THAT WOULD BE FOR THE MORE TRADITIONAL DEFERRED MAINTENANCE PROJECTS. AND THREE HUNDRED MILLION WOULD BE FOR MORE MODERNIZATIONS OF. BUILDINGS AND ENERGY USAGE OF THOSE BUILDINGS WHILE ALSO TAKING CARE OF DEFERRED MAINTENANCE ISSUES. YOU MENTIONED SO SICK THE TOTAL WAS SIX BILLION DOLLARS FOR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE THAT IS OUR CURRENT LIST. CAMPUSES MAYBE YOU MENTION SEISMIC WHAT'S THE TOTAL FOR THE SEISMIC DO WE HAVE IT YET WE DO NOT YET HAVE THE TOTAL ESTIMATE FOR THE COST OF THE ACTUAL CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS. IT WAS OUR PLAN SHOULD THE BOND HAVE PASSED TO USE ALMOST THE ENTIRE TWO BILLION FOR SEISMIC PROJECTS. OF SOMEONE SUGGESTED TO ME THAT THAT WOULD TAKE YOUR BERKELEY- THAT'S IT WOULD NOT TAKE CARE OF ALL OUR SYSTEM WIDE NEEDS THAT'S CORRECT SIR. WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT SYSTEM MY NEEDS FOR SEISMIC. SO WE ARE INTERNALLY AT THIS POINT EVALUATING- THE PROJECTS THAT THE LA- OF RECOMMENDED YOU REJECT BECAUSE THEY WERE DEPENDENT ON THE BOND PASSING SO WE ARE- TAKING A LOOK AT THOSE PROJECTS TO SEE. HOW WE WOULD PROCEED FORWARD WITH THEM AND WE WILL BE IN COMMUNICATION WITH YOU SHORTLY ABOUT THAT. AND YOU'LL- I ASSUME YOU WILL TRIAGE THEM FOR US AS WELL I WOULD BE MOST INTERESTED IN. IN IN LEARNING WHICH ONES ARE SEISMICALLY CRITICAL. OF THE PROP ALL OF THE PROJECTS THAT WE WERE REQUESTING FUNDING FOR OR OF THIS BUDGET YEAR OUR LEVEL SIX OR LEVEL FIVE PROJECT THE FIFTY. FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IN PROJECTS TO SEVEN PROJECTS TO RECEIVE PLANNING FUNDS IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT OF THE FIFTY MILLION FOR THE PLANNING FUNDS AND ALSO THE- ALMOST THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS OR SYSTEM WIDE- SEISMIC PROGRAM THOSE PROJECTS BUT THAT THREE HUNDRED MILLION INCLUDES THE CONSTRUCTION COMPONENT OF THOSE PROJECTS SO THOSE PROJECTS WOULD BE FULLY COMPLETED. WITHIN THE NEXT. TWO YEARS SO ITEMS ONE TO FOURTEEN ON THE- EIGHT ON THE FACILITY PROJECTS LIST ON PAGE SIX OF THE AGENDA ARE ALL. SEISMICALLY RATED AT THE SIX LEVEL. DID I HEAR THAT RIGHT UP THAT THAT IS CORRECT SEISMIC SIX OR SEISMIC FIVE. JUST TO CLARIFY THERE ARE TWO SEISMIC FIVE THEY'RE THERE TO LEVEL FIVES IN HERE. ON THE ROSTERS ARE LEVEL SIXES. THANK YOU I DIDN'T MEAN TO. I DO IT BUT I DIDN'T MEAN TO DERAIL YOU. THAT'S THAT'S ALL RIGHT SIR OF AND JUST TO ADDRESS THE ALEJO'S CONCERNS REGARDING THE TIMING OF THE CONSTRUCTION PART OF THE REASON WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT FOR US TO RECEIVE BOTH THE PLANNING FUNDS AND THE CONSTRUCTION FUNDS AT THE SAME TIME. IS THAT AS UNIVERSITY CAMPUSES WE DO HAVE A CERTAIN SCHEDULE BASED ON WHICH IT'S MUCH EASIER FOR US TO SHUT DOWN A BUILDING SO WE WANT TO UTILIZE THOSE SUMMER MONTHS AS PART OF THE CONSTRUCTION PROCESS. OF AS THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE STATED EARLIER WE ARE EXPECTED TO TURN IN OUR PLANS IN SEPTEMBER FOR APPROVAL TO FOLLOWING JULY SO IF WE COMPLETE OUR PRELIMINARY PLANS AND WE HAVE A COST ESTIMATE. WE WOULD HAVE TO WAIT TO START TO CONSIDER XIN FROM SEPTEMBER THE FOLLOWING JULY. WITHOUT APPROVAL WELL AS IF YOU APPROVE OUR HONOR PLANTS AND CONSTRUCTION. THE SOONEST PLANS ARE DONE TO MOVE INTO THE CONSTRUCTION PHASE AND NOT HAVE DELAY. I'M A CONCERT I KNOW THE ALEJO'S SERMON THEN I'M LESS CONCERNED WITH. WITH. TREATING YOU SEE THE WAY WE TREAT D. G. S. AND THEY CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS THAT I'M ACCUSTOMED TO DEALING WITH. ALTHOUGH TRUST BUT VERIFY SO AS SOON AS SOME REPORTING REQUIREMENT BUILT IN HERE THAT WE WILL HAVE REPORTS ON ON WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE PROGRESS SO AT SOME POINT IN TIME SOMEONE CAN STEP IN IT LOOKS LIKE. UNEXPECTEDLY YOU ARE GOING TO GO OFF THE TRACKS WE IN. PULL YOU BACK IN YES SIR. THAT'S IT THAT'S IT. HELLO I'VE ACTUALLY WHAT THE SUPPLEMENT BOTH YOUR COMMENTS AND UC'S OR AGREE THAT- SINCE THIS IS THROUGH THEIR SUPPORT BUDGETS- IT'S IN LINE WITH THE AB NINETY FOUR PROCESS AND FROM FINANCE RESPECTIVELY DON'T FEEL THAT THERE IS A NEED TO HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE PROCESS TWICE ONCE FOR DESIGN AND ONCE FOR CONSTRUCTION. I ALSO JUST WANT TO MAKE A COUPLE OF COMMENTS ON THE- ON THE LA US. IN REGARDS TO USING G. O. BONDS FOR TO SEISMIC STUDIES. AND JUST A NOTE THAT IT'S OFTEN THE CASE WITH SAY- GEO BOND SUCH AS THE HIGH SPEED RAIL BONDS OR PROP FIFTY ONE WERE A SMALL PORTION OF IT IS USE FOR ADMINISTRATIVE TASKS. OKAY. IT WAS JUST I WAS JUST REMINDED. OF THE WE DON'T GET THE SAME SORT OF REPORTING HERE THAT WE'RE THAT I'M ACCUSTOMED TO SEEING. IN THE OTHER BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE I USED TO HAVE SO LET'S THINK ABOUT SOME LANGUAGE TO THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE- BUDGET COMMITTEE ON THESE CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS AND SEE IF THAT FORMAT THAT WE'RE ACCUSTOMED TO USING I THINK WITH SOME OF THE TGS MANAGE PROJECTS STATE CONSTRUCTION AROUND HERE FOR EXAMPLE. WE COULD APPLY THAT TO THIS SO WE AT LEAST KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON. IF LA IS CONCERNED. THAT MAKES SENSE. RIGHT GUEST IS A QUESTION MAKE SENSE THE STATEMENT AND THEN WE CAN FIGURE OUT IF WE CAN DESIGN SOME REPORTING REQUIREMENTS THAT MAKES SENSE. I'M I THINK IT MAKES SENSE I WILL SAY THE LAW DOES PROVIDE AN ANNUAL STATUS REPORTS ON N ALL OF THE PROJECTS WHERE DOES AGO DOES NOT A GOES TO THE LEGISLATURE AND TO THE ADMINISTRATION IT'S- WELL LET'S TAKE IT IS AN US TAKE A LOOK AT WHO'S WE- CRAFTED SOME. BUDGET LANGUAGE A COUPLE BUDGETS AGO. FOR SOME VERY SPECIFIC PROJECTS WHERE THERE WERE SOME REPORTS THAT WENT BACK TO THE CHAIR OF THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE BUDGET COMMITTEE. LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THAT LANGUAGE AND SEE IF THAT COULD APPLY HERE WITHOUT UNDULY RESTRICTING UC- OR- CAUSING A LOT OF WORK FOR YOU DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND- THAT WAY MY- JOINT LEGISLATIVE BUDGET COMMITTEE CHAIR WILL BE IN THE LOOP. SO AT LEAST IN THE INFORMATION LOW SO HERE SHE KNOWS WHAT'S GOING ON MAKES SENSE. IT'S PERFECT. OF THAT IS IT FOR THIS PANEL THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH A QUESTION SIMILAR. NUMBER TWO ISSUE TO YOU SEE MEDICAL EDUCATION. YEAH WE CAN CERTAINLY TRY TO ADD A CHAIR CHESSER. WE'LL HAVE SOMEBODY BRING IT YOU'RE BRINGING. OTHER DUTIES AS ASSIGNED. JUST LIKE WORKING HERE. GAINES. WHEREVER YOU LIKE TO BE YOU WANT TO BE YOU WOULD YOU YOU WANT TO. SOCIAL DISTANCING REMEMBER. COLLECTING PAPER UP HERE. OKAY IF WE COULD HAVE. YOU FOLKS IDENTIFY YOURSELVES FOR THE RECORD STARTING TO MY LEFT YOU'RE RIGHT CHANCELLOR CAME ACROSS SOME THE CHANCERY UC RIVERSIDE. DEBT FOR DAYS VICE CHANCELLOR FOR HEALTH SCIENCES AND DEAN OF THE SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT UC RIVERSIDE BEING GOOD TO SEE YOU YES MA'AM I MEAN ALL. AT THE YOU SEE ARE SCHOOL BUT- THANK YOU FOR DOING THAT. WHAT IS IN CONSTANT FOR US AGAIN I'M STILL ERE I'M STILL GLAD YOU'RE STILL WITH US. YES SIR BRIAN RELIGIOUS DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE COULD HAVE MORNING. REBEKAH KIRK DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. OKAY WHO WANTS TO START. THE ADMINISTRATION CAN INTRODUCE SO THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSES A FORTY MILLION DOLLAR INCREASE ON GOING GENERAL FUNDING TO SUPPORT EXPANDED ENROLLMENT IN OPERATING CAPACITY FOR MEDICAL EDUCATION PROGRAMS. TWENTY FIVE MILLION WOULD SPECIFICALLY SUPPORT THE UC ARE UC RIVERSIDE SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AND FIFTEEN MILLION WOULD SUPPORT THE UC SAN FRANCISCO. FRESNO BRANCH CAMPUS AND THAT WOULD BE IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE UC MERCED. AS THIS COMMITTEE KNOWS THE STATE HAS SOME REGIONS THAT ARE UNDER SERVED WITH AND THEY HAVE A PHYSICIAN SHORTAGES AND HEALTH OUTCOMES ISSUES SO THE ADMINISTRATION IS PROPOSING THESE RESOURCES TO HELP BOOST-ENROLLMENT AND ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES. AND I THINK BY THE WAY REPRESENTING THAT AREA THANK THE ADMINISTRATION- FOR YOUR EFFORTS OVER THE YEARS ACTUALLY IN THIS AREAS OF THANK YOU. WHO'S NEXT. YES SIR WE HAPPY TO RESPOND TO THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL ON SO ARE WE HAVE THREE- I'LL GO THROUGH THREE BROAD MESSAGES WE HAD THE FIRST IS THINKING ABOUT. A PHYSICIAN WORKFORCE ISSUES BROADLY AND THEN THE SECOND WILL BE FOCUSED ON UC RIVERSIDE'S- PLAN UNDER THE PROPOSAL AND THEN THE THIRD WOULD BE THE UCSF PROPOSAL. THE THING ABOUT WORKFORCE ISSUES BROADLY THIS PROPOSAL APPEARS TO BE AIMED AT AN INCREASING THE SUPPLY OF PHYSICIANS REGIONALLY. I'M IN THE CASE OF RIVERSIDE IN THE INLAND EMPIRE IN THE CAS OF FRESNO IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY. AND THE EMPHASIS ON THESE REGIONS APPEARS WARRANTED THESE REGIONS DO YOU HAVE A LOW. OF SUPPLY PHYSICIANS PER CAPITA RELATIVE TO OTHER REGIONS IN THE STATE. I THINK THE THINK THE CRITICAL ISSUE FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER IS. THINKING ABOUT THE BEST WAYS TO ADDRESS THESE REGIONAL- NEEDS. ON THE MISS REGION'S PROPOSING INCREASING MEDICAL SCHOOL ENROLLMENTS THAT'S CERTAINLY ONE APPROACH IT- LIKELY WILL HAVE- AN INCREASE IN THE STATEWIDE SUPPLY PHYSICIANS. REGIONAL IMPACTS OF THESE PROPOSALS ARE A LITTLE BIT HARD TO EVALUATE- AND THAT'S BECAUSE MEDICAL SCHOOL STUDENTS- AFTER COMPLETING MEDICAL SCHOOL GO ON TO- COMPLETE POST GRADUATE TRAINING. IN SOME CASES IN DIFFERENT REGIONS WHERE THEY COMPLETED MEDICAL SCHOOL AND SOME ARGUE THAT STUDENTS WHEN THEY GO ON TO DO THE RESIDENCY PLANT ROOTS IN THOSE COMMUNITIES. THE STATE HAS- EXISTING PROGRAMS THAT DO PROVIDE FUNDING FOR RESIDENCY PROGRAMS ANOTHER INCENTIVE BASED PROGRAMS LIKE A LOAN REPAYMENTS. THE PROGRAMS. COULD HAVE A STRONGER REGIONAL CONNECTION BECAUSE THEY'RE TIED AT THE BACK END OF THE- OF THE EDUCATION AND TRAINING PIPELINE. THAT'S SAID THERE ISN'T ENOUGH- EVIDENCE THAT ARE A DATA ACROSS ALL THESE. PROPOSALS TO REALLY OFFER SOMETHING MORE DEFINITIVE TO THE LEGISLATURE SO JUST AN AREA OF UNCERTAINTY AS YOU'RE WEARING THESE PROPOSALS. I'M MOVING ON TO UC RIVERSIDE THE UC RIVERSIDE- DID SUBMIT TO US A LONG TERM- MULTI YEAR PLAN UNDER THE PROPOSAL. AND THE ELEMENTS OF THAT PLAN ARE SUMMARIZED AT A HIGH LEVEL ON PAGE FOURTEEN OF YOUR AGENDA. WE UNDERSTAND THE CRUX OF IT TO BE ESSENTIALLY THREE. THINGS THE FIRST IS IT WOULD ALSO ALLOW THE CAMPUS TO- REPLACE IT. AS AN EXISTING AMOUNT OF SUPPORT THAT A PROVIDES TO ON THE MEDICAL SCHOOL ABOUT SIX MILLION. ON RE DIRECTED FOR OTHER PRIORITIES IT SECONDLY WOULD- ADDRESS A DEFICIT THAT THE SCHOOLS EXPERIENCING IN THE CURRENT YEAR. AND THEN THIRD AS YOU WAIT AS THE ADMINISTRATION NOTED A GROWN WOMAN THERE HELPING TAT. AB THEY CURRENTLY ENROLLED ABOUT EIGHTY STUDENTS IN THE COHORT THEY'RE HOPING TO UNROLL ABOUT A HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE STUDENTS IN THE COHORT WE HAVE THREE ISSUES TO CONSIDER AS REVIEWING THIS PROPOSAL. OF THE FIRST JUST TO GET MORE INFORMATION ON THE CAMPUS IS PLANNED TO RE DIRECT. SOME OF THE REDUCING THE AMOUNT OR OR EXPECTING MORE MOMENT GROSS BUT YOU WOULD WANT TO WORK WITH THE SCHOOL TO UNDERSTAND ALL THE ELEMENTS OF THAT. ON THE SECOND- ISSUE TO CONSIDER IS THAT A LOT OF THE ENROLLMENT GROWTH- WOULDN'T OCCUR IN TOLL ON. A LATER YEARS AND THAT'S BECAUSE THE SCHOOL FIRST HAS TO CONSTRUCT A BUILDING TO ACCOMMODATE THE ENROLLMENT GROWTH ONE OF THE FUNDING IS COMING IN THIS YEAR- WENT WHEN ISSUE WHEN IT CONSERVE YOU COULD CONSIDER IS UP AS A- APPROACH THAT FUNDS THE TIMES THE FOUR. TIMES FUNDING CLOSER TO WIN WOMAN GROWTH WOULD BE OCCURRING. THAT'S A MORE STANDARD PRACTICE- WHEN THE STATE PROVIDES A MOMENT OF FUNDING FOR THE SEGMENTS. AND THE THIRD ISSUE TO CONSIDER IS CURRENT THE CURRENT PROPOSAL.DOESN'T HAVE AN ENROLLMENT TARGET AND IT'S STANDARD PRACTICE IN THE STATE BUDGET TO SAID IN ROMAN TARGET. ON WHEN THERE'S FUNDING FOR ENROLLMENT GROWTH INSURES THAT- THIS STATE COURT ON ITS EXPECTATIONS. AND THEN MOVING JUST YOU SEE. UCSF FRESNO THIS WAS A LITTLE DIFFERENT IN THAT THERE ISN'T A MULTI YEAR PLAN CURRENTLY ATTACHED TO THE PROPOSAL LEAST ONE IS NOT SUITED TO OUR OFFICE YET- SO WE RECOMMEND YOU FIRST. GET A PLAN IN PLACE AND REVIEW THAT PLAN BEFORE APPROPRIATING FUNDING. WE THINK OF A PLAN THAT WOULD BE MOST HELPFUL THE LEGISLATURE WOULDN'T JUST. ALL PROVIDE ONE OPTION IT WOULD PROVIDE SEVERAL OPTIONS RANGING IN COST AND EFFECTIVENESS FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO EVALUATE THE TRADE OFFS OF. A LOWER COST OPTION COULD BE TO. PRIORITIZE SORT OF EXISTING MEDICAL SCHOOL SLOT SET YOU SEE YOURSELF AND YOU SEE A FRESNO FOR STUDENTS WHO ARE THEY BELIEVE ARE MORE LIKELY TO STAY IN THE REGION. AND THEN THE MORE COST INTENSIVE ONES WOULD BE TO EXPAND YOU SEE US ARE FRESNO AS A FOR YOUR CAMPUS OR TO CREATE A JOINT PROGRAM WITH MERCED. ONCE THAT ONCE THOSE ARE PLANS ARE IN PLACE WE CAN RECOMMEND YOU HAVE A HEARING TO VET EACH PLAN AND WAIT EACH OPTION AND ULTIMATELY DECIDE WHICH APPROACH LEGISLATURE WOULD LIKE TO. TAKE TAKING THAT APPROACH WOULD IT WOULD GIVE THE LEGISLATURE MORE OF A BASIS ON A MULTI YEAR APPROACH TO. PROVIDE FUNDING TO EXPAND. SERVICES IN THE REGION MY UNDERSTANDING FROM READING THE MATERIAL. VARIOUS MATERIALS IS THAT- YOU CO P. AND YOU SEE AS A WHOLE IS IN THE PROCESS OF PUTTING TOGETHER A MORE DETAILED PLAN. TO EITHER ADOPT ONE OF THE THREE OPTIONS THAT HAS BEEN TALKED ABOUT FOR SOME TIME INCLUDING HAVING UC MERCED PROVIDE THE FIRST TWO YEARS OF THE BASIC SCIENCE EDUCATION FOR MEDICAL STUDENTS. AND THEN HAVING THOSE MEDICAL STUDENTS GO SOME. TWO YEARS WHICH FRANKLY IS THE WAY THAT THE UC YOUR CAMPUS DID IT FOR FORTY OR FIFTY. YEARS GIVE OR TAKE- DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA AS TO WHAT THE TIME LINE IS FOR THAT- FOR THAT BINDING DOCUMENT AND WHETHER WE WILL HAVE IT BEFORE WE HAVE TO MAKE DECISIONS. FOLLOWING THE MAY REVISION TO THE BUDGET. OF THE UNIVERSITY DID SIGNAL TO US THAT IT WAS THEIR GOAL TO GET US A PLAN BEFORE- DECISIONS WOULD BE MADE IT'S AN OLD I'M MARCH WHEN THEY WHEN WE COMMUNICATED WITH THEM WHEN WE'RE READING ANALYSIS BE GOOD OPPORTUNITY TO GET AN UPDATE ON THAT TIMELINE. I'M IN ADDITION TO THIS PROPOSAL YOU MAY RECALL THAT THE STATE BUDGET LAST YEAR AUTHORIZED- A CONSTRUCTION OF A NOT ONLY A PROJECT UC RIVERSIDE BUT A PROJECT THAT YOU SEE MERCED AND IT APPEARS YOU SEE HAS SIGNAL TO US THAT THEY INTEND TO- APPROVE SOME SOME PROJECT CONNECTED TO THIS- IN MERCED- IN THE REGION SO I THINK IN APRIL SO GOING TO BE MORE IT COULD BE OPPORTUNITY TO GET MORE OF THAT WITH THAT SORT OF PROBLEM. HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE A B. NINETY FOUR. THIS RARE BIRDS PROPOSED. MYSTIC THROUGH FINANCE. TO COME TO US AND THAT'S NOT ON THE LIST THIS YEAR SO I ASSUME WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE TWENTY. TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. BUDGET PLANNING DOCUMENT FINANCE I DON'T MEAN TO NO GO AHEAD THAT'S CORRECT THE IT WOULD HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE AB NINETY FOUR PROCESS TO IF IS ACTUALLY A PROPOSAL FOR NEW FACILITIES. RIGHT SO WE WOULD EXPECT TO SEE THAT- WE WOULD NOT EXPECT TO SEE ANYTHING THIS YEAR. OKAY I DIDN'T MEAN TO I JUST WANTED TO FIND OUT WHAT WAS GOING. AND IT WOULD BE A GOOD OPPORTUNITY TO ASK ASK YOU SEE ABOUT ITS PLANS FOR THE FACILITY SEE IF IT'S- GOING TO SUBMIT SOMETHING FOR NEXT YEAR IF IT'S- UNDER DISCUSSION RIGHT NOW. UC'S LEVITATING OFF THE CHAIRS BACK THERE THEY'RE DYING TO GET APPEARS WELL WE'LL HAVE EVERYBODY HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO WEIGH IN ON THIS I'VE- I'M INTERESTED IN IN IN IN FACT HEARING WHAT THE TIME LINE IS BUT- THAT'S THE EXTENT OF OUR ANALYSIS WE'RE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTION. THOUGHTFUL ANALYSIS BY THE WAY I REALLY APPRECIATED. OKAY WHO'S NEXT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- FORGET IT THANK YOU FOR DRIVING UP- SOCIAL DISTANCING. NO AIRPORTS NORPLANT'S. NOW IT. THE IF THE DRUG. THAT IT'S GREAT TO BE HERE WITH THREE SENATORIAL FRIENDS- REALLY IS AN OPTICALLY MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK FOR HELP I NEED TO POINT OUT THAT MS ALFARO IS FROM CHINO. SO MAYBE CONNECTION ENERGY DRIVE TO LA I THINK SHE PLAYED WITH THE TEAM. YEP BUT IT'S FROM SUPPORT LIKE THE THREE OF YOU THAT HAS MADE YOU SEE OUR WHAT IT IS MONEY MAGAZINE NOW HAS US IDENTIFIED AS THE MOST TRANSFORMATIVE UNIVERSITY IN AMERICA. US NEWS AND WORLD REPORT SAYS WE'RE NUMBER ONE IN THE COUNTRY AND SOCIAL MOBILITY. AND WE CAN'T DO THAT FIRE CELLS THAT COMES WITH A GREAT GREAT SUPPORT FROM GREAT GREAT FRIENDS LIKE ALL OF YOU. WE'RE GRATEFUL TO THE GOVERNOR AND THE ADMINISTRATION FOR HIS RECOMMENDATION FOR THE TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR SUPPLEMENT- FOR THE UC RIVERSIDE SCHOOL OF MEDICINE. THAT'S PART OF WHAT WE BELIEVE TO BE A UP A CIRCLE OF SUPPORT THAT'S IMPORTANT TO US- IN PARTICULAR TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. FOR US WILL HELP US MAINTAIN OUR CURRENT OPERATIONS AND PLACES ON A PATH FORWARD AS THE LA- SUGGESTED FOR A- TOTAL IN ROME ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED MEDICAL STUDENTS. OUR MEDICAL SCHOOL STARTED IN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN IS THE FIRST NAME MEDICAL SCHOOL IN THE UC SYSTEM IN NEARLY FORTY YEARS. IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WE GOT FULL ACCREDITATION FROM THE LC ARMENIAN GRADUATE AT OUR FIRST QUARTER STUDENTS AND- OF FORTY STUDENTS IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN SO. OF AND THE SENATOR WAS THERE TO. GREET THOSE STUDENTS. TODAY WE ENROLL TWO HUNDRED NINETY ONE MEDICAL STUDENTS FORTY. 2% OF WHOM. ARE FIRST IN THEIR FAMILIES TO COMPLETE A MATCH BACHELOR'S DEGREE. AND 39% ARE FROM GROUPS UNDER REPRESENTED IN MEDICINE. MORE THAN 80% OF OUR MEDICAL SCHOOL GRADUATES ARE BETWEEN RESIDENCY TRAINING IN CALIFORNIA. WITH MORE THAN TWO THIRDS REMAINING IN CALIFORNIA NEARLY ONE THIRD. IN THE INLAND EMPIRE. WE OPERATE THE ONLY COMMUNITY BASED MEDICAL SCHOOL IN THE UC. WHICH MEANS THAT OUR MEDICAL STUDENTS AND RESIDENTS ARE BEDDED WITHIN EXISTING HOSPITALS WE DON'T RUN A SEPARATE HOSPITAL. AND THAT'S CRUCIAL TO THE IMPACT WE HAVE ON MEDICAL SERVICE ACROSS THE REGION. BUT AT THE SAME TIME NOT HAVING A HOSPITAL AS A LIMITED RUN RESOURCES SO IT'S A TRADE OFF BETWEEN THIS INDEBTEDNESS. AND THE EXTENT TO WHICH WE CAN RUN AN ENTERPRISE THAT GENERATE REVENUE TO THIS TO FEED ITSELF. WE'VE GOT OUR SAID A CHALLENGES- WE WERE UNDER. UNDER CAPITALIZE FROM THE BEGINNING- AND AS A RESULT- WE'VE BEEN SUBSIDIZING FROM THE FROM THE GENERAL UNIVERSITY BUDGET THE ALEJO'S CORRECT. WHEN HE POINTS OUT THAT I'LL SEE ME THOUGH. THE ACCREDITING GROUP AN AGENCY JIMMY THE FIRST FOR MEDICAL SCHOOLS A SECOND FOR GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION. HAVE ACTUALLY RAISED CONCERNS ABOUT THIS FUNDING- GAP IN THE FACT THAT WE WERE ALWAYS KIND OF BACK FILLING. THE IITIAL FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS THAT STARTED THE SCHOOL. HAS NOT BEEN INFLATED OR INCREASED AT ALL SINCE THE BEGINNING IT WASN'T ENOUGH THEN- TO DIFFERENT GROUPS- WE HIRED SOME PRIVATE CONSULTANTS THE TRUMP TRUMP TRIP- ON BOX. WHICH IS A CONSULTING FIRM THEY DID A NATIONAL COMPARISON AND THE REST AND- TO SUGGEST THAT WE NEED AND ANOTHER THIRTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS. OF THE CALIFORNIA FUTURE HEALTH WORKFORCE COMMISSION DID ANALYSIS THEY FORGET ABOUT THIRTY FIVE MILLION BUT ENDORSED THE TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR SUPPLEMENT. WHICH I THINK IS A FAIR WAY OF DEALING WITH THE NEEDS OF THE STATE. OF RIGHT NOW WE HAVE A HUGE COURT OF UNPAID VOLUNTEER FACULTY MEMBERS OF ABOUT 60% OF OUR OUR- ADJUNCT FACULTY ARE ARE UNPAID. TEACHER MENTOR UNIVERSITIES STUDENTS FOR FREE. OTHER UC'S A AND PRIVATE MEDICAL SCHOOLS CLINICAL FACT WE ARE NOT ONLY IN DEMAND BUT ARE PAID COMPETITIVE SALARIES FOR THIS IMPORTANT WORK. SO WE'RE REALLY WORKING ON THE KINDNESS OF STRANGERS RIGHT NOW- SPACE WISE WE'RE UP AGAINST IT AT- YOU SEE ARE. THE MEDICAL SCHOOL HAS BEEN BORROWING SPACE IN THE SCIENCE LIBRARY- OF LATE. THEY'VE UTILIZE SPACE OFFICE SPACE AT THE UC PATH CENTER WHICH IS ABOUT FIVE MILES DISTANT FROM THE CAMPUS. WE HAVE THEIR MEDICAL STUDENTS- MISSILE FAR WILL. WILL TO A TEST FOR MEDICAL STUDENTS IN TRAILERS IN THE PARKING LOT- FOR STUDY SPACE- SO WEIRD. EIGHT FULL FOR THE EFFORTS ON THE- ON OUR BEHALF. TO FIND MONEY TO BUILDING UP BUILDING FOR MEDICAL SCHOOL AND I'M EMBARRASSED TO SAY I WAS NOT AWARE OF THE- AGAINST THE REPORT BECAUSE THE MODULATORS BUT TRAILING. PREFERABLY SORRY WE'RE YOUR INTERNET I WAS NOT AWARE OF THE- FACT THAT WE WERE USING TRAILERS ON A UC CAMPUS TO. EDUCATE ANY STUDENTS ACTUALLY BUT CERTAINLY THE MEDICAL STUDENTS BUT I DIDN'T IT IS INTERESTING TO. READ THAT AND I PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE USED MORE APPROPRIATE MODULAR BUT- SOMEBODY WHO LIVED IN A TRAILER ONE TIME A DAY WITH ACTORS TO ME- SO WHAT'S THE FUTURE. FIRST I WANT TO THANK ALL OF YOU FOR EFFORTS TO GET ASSISTANCE TO THIS PLACE WE'RE IN A VERY DIFFERENT PLACE WE WERE. FEW IT FOR YEARS AGO- PLENTY FOR THE BUILDING IS UNDER WAY. WE EXPECT AS THE LA OPEN- REPORTED WE EXPECT MOVE IN AND TWENTY TWENTY THREE. AND THE TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS NOW IS CRUCIAL IN TERMS OF TIME FOR A FEW REASONS. FIRST IT'S A CURE IS THE FINANCIAL. SECURITY FOR THE- SCHOOL. DIRECTLY IN THE EYES OF THE CREDITORS. BUT NOT JUST THE CREDITORS. OTHERS AROUND THE COUNTRY MEDICAL SCHOOL FACULTY DEANS AND OTHERS TALK TO EACH OTHER AND KNOWING THAT THIS. A SOLID SCHOOL WITH A SOLID FINANCIAL FOOTING AS IMPORTANT TO OUR REPUTATION AND ABILITY TO RECRUIT. STUDENTS AFTER THE ALIVE. NUMBER TWO THERE'S A LOT OF START TO HIRE THE FACULTY WE CAN'T SIMPLY INCREASE THE ENROLLMENT IN THE SCHOOL. WITHOUT A BUILDING WITHOUT PEOPLE TO TEACH THE STUDENTS AND IT TAKES OF WILD START TO DO THAT WE HAVE TO COMMIT CELL REASON AND RESOURCE OF BOTH RECRUITMENT PROCESS AS WELL AS TO THE- TO THE OP PEOPLE THEMSELVES GET THEM HERE AND GET THEM INTO INTO THE- THE THROW THINGS. CHANCELLOR ME JUST I HATE THAT. I TEN INTERRUPT PEOPLE COLLEGES IN TO YOU. BUT IT OCCURS TO ME WHEN WE HIGHER MEDICAL FACULTY IT'S A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT AS IN IT THAN HIRING A- NO LESS IMPORTANT A POLITICAL SCIENCE PRESS PROFESSOR WERE AN ENGLISH PROFESSOR IN THAT THERE IS ULTRA THERE IS- OTHER EMPLOYMENT THAT TYPICALLY IS. TIED TO THE RECRUITMENT AND HIGHER OF A MEDICAL FACULTY MEMBER OF PHYSICIAN IS THAT NOT TO GET I'VE IF I COULD ONLY ANSWER PART OF THE QUESTION LISTED IN TO ANSWER FOR THE QUESTION TO- BECAUSE AT YOUR QUESTIONS RIGHT ON POINT. OF FOUR EIGHT LET'S LET'S TAKE IN A CHEMIST WHEN WE HIRE A CHEMIST IT TAKES ABOUT A YEAR TO DO THE RECRUITMENT THE SEARCH IDENTIFY THE PERSON WE NEED AND- WHETHER IT IS- ORGANIC OR WHATEVER MIGHT BE. UP WITH AND FIND A WAY TO BRING THEM TO CAMPUS INCLUDING A FAIR AMOUNT ANYWHERE FROM TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND TO A MILLION-DOLLARS OF ADDITIONAL SUPPORT IN ADDITION TO THEIR SALARY TO FACILITY TAKE THEIR LABORATORY RESEARCH AND ALL THE REST. FOR SUMMER MEDICAL SCHOOL FACULTY THAT IS THE CASE- THAT WE HAVE THANK YOU IN PROMOTE MANY OF A HUGE INVESTMENT IN RESOURCES TO SUPPORT THEIR WORK BUT THEY CAN SEE AN END TO THE RESEARCH WE NEED TO. DEFEND A FIGHT CORONAVIRUS. BUT YOU'RE ALSO RIGHT A FAIR NUMBER THEM A LARGE NUMBER OF THEM ARE INVOLVED IN CLINICAL ACTIVITY AND THAT MEANS ALL THIS EMBEDDEDNESS ON PUTTING TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT. I'M JUST TO ADD TO THIS- THE CLINICAL FALLACY THAT WE HAVE THAT WE HIRE THEY NOT ONLY DO PLAN A WAR BUT THEY ALSO. EDUCATION AND KEEPING IN MIND THAT WE ARE COMMUNITY BASED MEDICAL SCHOOL WITHOUT A MEDICAL CENTER WE CREATE VARIOUS PLATFORMS THAT PROVIDE THE EDUCATION FOR ALL STUDENTS SO WHEN I HIRE A CLINICAL FACULTY I MAY SAY THAT FORTY A 50% OF YOUR TIME WILL BE DEDICATED TO CLAN OF A WORK IN THE PLANET. ANOTHER 3040% WOULD BE DEDICATED TO TEACHING AND THEREFORE I HAVE TO HIGH THE WHOLE F. T. E. NOT JUST THE TEACHING PART BECAUSE AS A CLINICIAN THEY DON'T JUST TEACH THEY DO. CLINICAL WORK AS WELL. TO THE PLACEMENTS NOT ONLY IN THE LAST BUT ALSO IN A- SETTING SOME ABSOLUTE EITHER OF YOUR- OR SO. ELSE AND OF COURSE YOU HAVE TO HAVE THE CLINICAL VOLUME TO DO THAT BUT ALSO THE DEANS THEN RESPONSIBLE FOR MANAGING. A HOST OF CONTRACTS WITH OTHER PROVIDERS ACROSS THE REGION. SO WE HAVE TO COMMIT. FOR INSTANCE RUN IN AN EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT AND THAT MEANS EX NUMBER FIFTY EASE THAT AS THE DANGER WENT OUT IS NOT. PEOPLE ITS OTHERS UP A HOST OF. ARRANGEMENTS THAT OUR INSTITUTIONAL AS WELL AS PERSONAL THESE INDIVIDUAL PEOPLE HAVE TO DECIDE. THEIR WHAT THE FUTURE'S GOING TO BE SO DID THERE'S A LONG RAMP UP PERIOD. THANK YOU FOR. THE DIVERSION. MY ARE A PLEASURE- A THIRD. UP ON THIS LIST OF WHY WE NEED THE MONEY NOW IS FACILITIES AND EQUIPMENT- WERE VERY PROPER MEDICAL SCHOOL BUT- WE'RE DOING A GREAT JOB THEY'RE DOING A GREAT JOB WITH. LIMITED RESOURCES WE HAVE REALLY BEEN SIMULATION I MEAN. FOR ALL OUR STUDENTS. RIGHT NOW. AND THAT'S- OKAY TRIBUTE TO THE PEOPLE THE SCHOOL TO MAKE THAT WORK BUT IT IS NOT A FUTURE. WE HAVE A LOT OF FACILITIES INVESTMENTS WE NEED TO MAKE BE READY TO DO A OF A REALLY GOOD JOB AS WE AS WE EXPAND THIS GROUP. THE CLASS SIZES BEEN NOTED ARE ARE THIS WILL PUT US ON OUR PATH TO FIVE HUNDRED MEDICAL STUDENTS BY THE FALL OF TWENTY TWENTY SIX. WHICH IS A PRETTY AGGRESSIVE SCHEDULE- I BELIEVE. AND THEN LAST THE LA- IS CORRECT A YOU SHOULD ACTUALLY BE ASKING WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO. AS WE RECENT RESHAPE THIS WE'VE BEEN PUTTING OUR NUMBERS ARE SEVENTY NINE ONLY BE SOMEWHERE BETWEEN SIX AND TEN LET'S AGREE. OF GENERAL UNIVERSITY FUNDS HAVE BEEN. SUBSIDIZING THE MEDICAL SCHOOL REALLY FROM CONCEPTION AND THAT'S JUST OPERATING THAT'S NOT INCLUDING CAPITAL THE SMMIT OF HAD HAD BY THE MODULES AND SET HIM UP AND- LEASES SPACE IT DOES YOU SEE PATH AND SO FORTH. SO WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN WITH THAT A- I. IT IS THE CASE THAT. ARE YOU SEE ARE AS YOUR DOLLARS PER STUDENT THAN MOST OF THE REST OF THE UC- NUMBER ONE AND NUMBER TWO WE'VE BEEN PART OF A PRETTY. AGGRESSIVE AS A LOT OF OTHER. HAVE AND WE'VE DONE THAT WITHOUT NON RESIDENT FUNDS IN LARGE LARGE. LARGE MEASURE SO WHAT THIS WILL LET US DO IS GET BACK TO. PROVIDING A SORT RESOURCES IN THIS REPORT FOR THE OTHER STUDENTS- THAT WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN. WE WISH WE HAD BEEN ABLE TO DO FOR THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS. THOUGH IT THE MONEY WILL GO TO THE TO HELP THE STUDENTS FOR THE GROWTH HAS BEEN. AND TO HELP THE FEDERAL BUST NATURE OF WORK WE WANTED TO THE STUDENTS WE'VE HAD. WE WON A NATIONAL AWARD FOR IMPROVED GRADUATION RATE. IN A GRADUATE LEVEL. US WITH A MAKING GOOD PROGRESS BUT WE'RE STILL NOT WERE RELUCTANTLY. I GUESS IT'S A FAIR STATEMENT TO SAY THAT. BECAUSE IT'S OBVIOUS FROM WHAT HOW. BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND AND- TWELVE REALLY AND BEFORE BUT CERTAINLY TWELVE THIRTEEN AND TODAY. THAT THE CAMPUS AND THIS CHANCELLOR. ARE COMMITTED. TO THE SUCCESS OF THE MEDICAL SCHOOL SO WHATEVER RESOURCES THE CAMPUS HAS. YEAH TO ENSURE THAT THE SIX ARE MANAGEABLE IT'S NOT A SUPPLEMENT. WE'RE ALL PART OF THE FAMILY. WELL AFTER DARK SOCIAL DISTANCE LEFT. LOVE TO TALK TO YOU SEE YOU THE OTHER ISSUE WAS THE USE UP CONTINUED SUPPORT WILL HAVE YOU SEE OF P. I'M SURE IN A SECOND. COME UP AND TALK TO US ABOUT THAT THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION THANK YOU IN AND ALL THREE OF US ARE READY FOR QUESTIONS. OKAY SEVERAL OF THE QUESTIONS WELL NOT SO MUCH A QUESTION AS A STATEMENT- YOU JUST A GREAT SOURCE OF PRIDE FOR THE INLAND EMPIRE AND- CANCER WILCOX DR DEAN'S MS ALFARO A GREAT SEE BOTH OF YOU AGAIN IT WAS JUST LAST WEEK THAT WE'RE OUT OF THE CAMPUS- AND WAS WONDERFUL TO HAVE OUR YOUNG WOMEN'S CONFERENCE THERE WITH OVER THREE HUNDRED YOUNG WOMEN TO HEAR ABOUT YOU SEE ARE AND HOW WONDERFUL WONDERFUL YOU ARE AND WHAT YOU'RE DOING BUT I JUST THINK YOU KNOW WE DO DO A LOT FOR OTHER C'S AND TO ME IT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE DO THE SAME IF NOT MORE. FOR YOU SEE OUR IN THE INLAND EMPIRE AND REALLY BUILD A EVEN IN EVEN MORE ROBUST MEDICAL SCHOOL BECAUSE WE KNOW WE ARE WOEFULLY SHORT WHEN IT COMES TO PHYSICIANS AND RESEARCH SHOWS THIS AS YOU WELL KNOW THAT WHEN FOLKS TO THE RESIDENCY IN A CERTAIN AREA THEY STAY THERE AND WE WANT MYSELF FARO FROM CHINO WHO WOULD IT HAVE SO I WENT TO THE LOGO AND YES THAT YOU SEE ARE TO STAY IN THE REGION AND TAKE CARE OF OUR FOLKS SO I WILL ALWAYS BE IN SUPPORT OF WHATEVER WE CAN DO TO MAKE SURE YOU HAVE ADEQUATE FUNDING. I THINK YOU'VE DONE A PHENOMENAL JOB ON THE LITTLE BIT WE HAVE BEEN YOU SO I JUST LOOK FORWARD TO DOING MORE AND THANK YOU FOR MAKING US LOOK SO GOOD IN THE INLAND EMPIRE. ZERO YEAH I JUST WANNA SAY AGAIN THANK YOU AS WE WORK TOGETHER OVER THE YEARS AND JUST KEEP MOVING FORWARD AND- WITH SENATOR LEYVA WE ARE IN NEED OF THAT MEDICAL SCHOOL- YES I THINK WE ALL KNOW SO THANK YOU. WELL I HAVE NO OTHER QUESTIONS LET'S DO THIS- MAYBE I CAN ASK. FINANCE IN LA- TO SHIFT TO THEIR TRADITIONAL CHAIRS UP HERE IF YOU DON'T MIND APPRECIATE. YOU DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE TO LEAVE CHANCES SOMEBODY MAY HAVE SOMETHING UNLESS YOU TRYING TO GET OUT OF YOUR- ARE YOU TRYING TO SOCIAL DISTANCE FROM ME. AND LET ME INVITE. OUR OTHER UC REPRESENTATIVES UP. BECAUSE I DO MY FAMILY TOO I COMPLETELY. I COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND I DO THINK WE OUGHT TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE FRESNO UCSF OPERATION AND ALSO MADE PERHAPS YOU COULD TOUCH N THE LA THOSE POINTS- HAVING TO DO WITH CONTINUED COMMITMENT- AND FUNDING OF THE UC OUR MEDICAL SCHOOL I BELIEVE THERE WAS A COMMENT IN THE IN THE ANALYSIS ABOUT. THE TWO MILLION DOLLARS. IN FUNDING- ANNUAL. SO THOSE ISSUES MA'AM OKAY. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US IF YOU TO IDENTIFY YOURSELF FOR THE RECORD. COME ON NOT YET ONE MORE PUSH. NOW YOU ARE ALL RIGHT THERE WE GO. RED ORDINARILY MEAN STOP I'M SO- GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS KATHERINE NATION I'M THE VICE PRESIDENT FOR HEALTH SCIENCES WHICH MEANS THE HEALTH SCIENCES INSTRUCTIONAL SYSTEM FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA WHICH INCLUDES HAPPILY ARE SIX SCHOOL% OF MEDICINE- BUT FIVE LONG STANDING SCHOOLS- I ALSO BRING A VANTAGE POINT OF LONG SERVICE ON THE STATE'S CALIFORNIA HELP WORKFORCE POLICY COMMISSION. WHICH IS REALLY GIVEN ME AN OPPORTUNITY TO LOOK IN TRACK STATE WORKFORCE NEEDS ACROSS THE REGION BOTH FOR PHYSICIANS ADVANCED PRACTICE PROVIDERS AND OTHERS AND THEN IS AN ADDITION I SERVED AS THE SENIOR ADVISER FOR PRESIDENT IMPALA CANO IN HER CAPACITY AS THE CO CHAIR OF THE CALIFORNIA FUTURE WORKFORCE COMMISSION. SO ALL OF THAT DOWN BRING SO A BIT OF A UNIQUE PERSPECTIVE ON I ALSO WANT TO ECHO TRANSFER WILCOX'S GRATITUDE- BEFORE THEY DIED GOVERNOR IN ADMINISTRATION SUPPORT ATTENTION- TO BOTH OF THESE REGIONS OF THE STATE- I AM AT A LONG DEEP BELIEVER IN THE FUTURE ON THE PROMISE OF THE RIVERSIDE- SCHOOL OF MEDICINE THOSE RESOURCES ARE VITALLY NEEDED- WITH ME IN SPIRIT- BUT BUT NOT NEXT TO ME TODAY OR THE LEADERSHIP OF THE UCSF SCHOOL OF MEDICINE CHANCELLOR HOW GOOD- DEAN TALMADGE KING IN THE VICE DEAN FOR MEDICAL EDUCATION WHO'S DONE EXTENSIVE WORK WITH OUR COLLEAGUES THAT YOU SEE FRESNO AND- WE'RE SAID- AND WITH. MY INVOLVEMENT REALLY THROUGHOUT ON THE POSSIBILITIES FOR MEDICAL EDUCATION PROGRAM THERE SO- I THINK- SHORTEN DECK HAS BEEN CIRCULATED IN A FIVE MIGHT- I TAKE A FEW MINUTES- BECAUSE I THINK THIS IS A DRIVER FOR CONSIDERATION OF THE LEGISLATURE IN THE STATE WITH THESE PROPOSED FUNDS AGAIN BOTH REGIONS IN VITAL NEED. FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA THIS IS MISSION ALIGNED- WE HAVE THE CAPABILITY TO OPERATE- AMONG THE MOST SUCCESSFUL AND HIGHLY REGARDED MEDICAL SCHOOLS IN THE NATION AND INTERNATIONALLY AND WE BELIEVE THAT CABLE. SHOULD BE LEVERAGED. IN AREAS LIKE THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY THAT ARE NOT HOME TO A MEDICAL SCHOOL RIVERSIDE BY CONTRAST HAD A LONG HISTORY WITH UCLA THAT HELPED BUILD THIS INFRASTRUCTURE SO I KIND OF BE BEGIN WITH A DEMOGRAPHIC- IMPERATIVE- SO WE'LL SWITCH NOW FROM THE INLAND EMPIRE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY HERE YOU SEE- THE REGION WITH EIGHT COUNTIES IS HOME TO FOUR POINT THREE- MILLION PEOPLE AND IS ALSO AMONG THE FASTEST GROWING REGIONS OF THE STATE- SIMILAR TO THE CHALLENGES WE KNOW THAT EXIST FOR THE INLAND EMPIRE- WE HAVE THE S. A. J. V. THAT. LAGS IN VIRTUALLY ALL SOCIO ECONOMIC AND HEALTH CARE INDICATORS AGAIN AND I CAN SAY THAT I'VE WATCHED THAT BE TRUE IN MY ROLE AS COMMISSIONER I'VE WATCHED IT BE TRUE AS WE WATCH MEDICAL STUDENTS FROM THROUGHOUT THE STATE SEEK ADMISSION TO A PUBLIC MEDICAL SCHOOL WITH NO PLACE TO GO. INLAND EMPIRE BEYOND S. JV HAVE HIGH RATES OF POVERTY- THE S. JB IN PARTICULAR HAS POOR AIR QUALITY- TROUBLESOME FOR OUR KIDS AND OLDER ADULTS AND YOU SEE FOUR OF THOSE COUNTIES THAT ARE AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS STATE- FOR THEIR RESIDENTS AND HEALTH OUTCOMES. SO WE TALKED A LITTLE BIT EARLIER ABOUT SHORTAGES OF POSITIONS IN THE INLAND EMPIRE THE SHORTAGES ARE AS DIRE FOR THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY- YOU HAVE DATA BEFORE YOU AND I WON'T GO INTO DETAIL BUT IT IS AVAILABLE SHOULD IT BE OF. INTEREST THAT THIS EIGHT COUNTY REGION HAS AMONG THE LOWEST RATES OF PROVIDERS- IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND THE NATION WITH REALLY A GENERATION OF PROVIDER SLATED TO RETIRE AND ALL ALL PUT A PAUSE ON. THAT BECAUSE- I SPEND TIME WITH COLLEAGUES IN A NATIONAL CONTEXT IN TERMS OF MEDICAL SCHOOLS THE CHANCELLOR MENTIONED. THE EYES OF MEDICAL SCHOOLS ACROSS THE COUNTRY WATCHING FOR THEIR SUCCESS IN THE INVESTMENT OF YOU SEE ARE. ON BUT ALL ALL ALSO SAY THAT WE KNOW A LOT ABOUT- DEMANDS FOR MEDICAL STUDENT EDUCATION THE THINGS THAT LEVERAGE SUCCESS THE PREDICTIVE VALUE WHICH INCLUDES RESIDENCY TRAINING BUT WHAT'S PREDICTIVE OF. WHERE STUDENTS WERE ULTIMATELY PRACTICES WHERE THEY HAVE TIES TO THEIR COMMUNITY. DO YOU SEE OUR IN OUR EXTRAORDINARY MEDICAL STUDENT HERE WITH TIES TO THE COMMUNITY THE OBVIOUS PART OF THAT AND RIVERSIDE HAS PREFERENTIAL CONSIDERATION FOR STUDENTS WHO COME FROM THE REGION. PROGRAM ALL TALK ABOUT SHORTLY WOULD ALSO SIMILARLY HAVE PREFERENTIAL CONSIDERATION FOR STUDENTS THAT COME FROM THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY BECAUSE WE KNOW THIS IS PREDICTED. AND IF WE KEEP THEM THERE AND TRAIN THEM THERE WE STACKED TOGETHER THE BEST PRACTICES THAT WE KNOW OVER. DECADES AND DECADES OF TIME ABOUT HOW TO ENHANCE THE LIKELIHOOD OF STUDENTS GOING THROUGH MEDICAL SCHOOL THEN TRAINING AND THEN ENTERING PRACTICE FOR ENTIRE PRACTICE CAREER IN A REGION. THERE'S NOT ANY INDICATION THAT STUDENTS FROM- OTHER COMMUNITIES WITH NO CONNECTION ARE LIKELY TO MIGRATE. ON SO. I EASY YOU SEE THE EVIDENCE OF THIS IS LOW- CALIFORNIA AS A WHOLE HAS AMONG THE OLDEST PHYSICIANS. IN THE NATION I THINK WERE MAYBE BEHIND IN MEXICO- THAT MEANS THE SHORTAGES THAT OFSTED REPORTS ON EVERY YEAR THOSE ARE GOING TO GROW WE'RE WE'RE LOSING PACE- OUR RELIANCE ON IN MIGRATION OF. STUDENTS AND RESIDENTS TRAINED ELSEWHERE IS NOT FILLING THE GAP THE GAPS ARE WIDENING AND WHEN THIS WHOLE GENERATION GETS READY TO RETIRE OVER THIS NEXT YEAR- THOSE THOSE SHORTAGES ON WHAT WILL BE GREATER TODAY- THAN THEY ARE. SO YOU SEE IT'S A FRESNO- I THINK IS THE TITLE FOR THE GOVERNOR'S- LINE ITEM BUT LET ME SAY THAT THAT BEGAN FORTY THAT THAT. THAT PROGRAM IS PRIMARILY GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION FOCUS THIS IS RESIDENCY TRAINING IT'S BEEN IN EXISTENCE FOR FORTY FIVE YEARS. UCSF AND UC DAVIS SEND STUDENTS IT'S ALSO HOME TO MEDICAL. FROM OTHER SCHOOLS WHERE IT- IS POSSIBLE TO ACCOMMODATE THEM SO WE HAVE EXPERIENCE TEACHING FACULTY WE HAVE ESTABLISHED RESIDENCY PROGRAM- THAT HAVE A RECORD OF SUCCESS IN PREPARING THE REGION'S WORKFORCE. WHICH IS THE AIM OF THE SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AND INFRASTRUCTURE AND GM ME FOR THE INLAND EMPIRE IT'S PROVEN IT'S PREVENT THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY IT'S PROVEN IN THIS STATE. WE JUST DON'T HAVE THOSE TYPES OF OPPORTUNITIES FOR STUDENTS IN THIS REGION- OF CALIFORNIA SO THIS FOUNDATION AT UCSF IS. REALLY ON THE CRITICAL RESOURCE FOR MEDICAL STUDENT ROTATIONS FOR RESIDENCY TRAINING FOR REGIONAL PRODUCTS PRESENCE THAT WOULD LEVERAGE. CLINICAL FACULTY EXPERIENCE FACULTY- WHO KNOW HOW TO TEACH FROM THE HOW TO TRAIN RESIDENTS RESIDENTS ARE INTEGRAL TO THE INSTRUCTION OF MEDICAL STUDENTS SO. THAT YOU CASF RUST ON FRESNO MEANS THAT THAT RESOURCE DOES NOT HAVE TO BE BUILT IT'S AN AND DURING STATE RESOURCE THAT COULD BE LEVERAGED- FOR THIS PURPOSE. WE DID WE JUST MAKE A COMMENT. I HAVE BEEN A SUPPORTER. OF ESTABLISHING A MEDICAL SCHOOL OPERATION. IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. THE TIME I ARRIVED HERE. IN THE BEGINNING OF TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN THE SAME TIME THAT I CAME UP AND OBVIOUSLY WAS ADVOCATING AS A REPRESENTATIVE FOR AND SO THE CALIFORNIA. GROUP SO YOU HAVE A. A FRIENDLY CROWD HERE I KNOW THAT- I KNOW THAT AND I SAID THAT ACTUALLY LEAVING HIS MY TIME RIGHT NOW IS ALL COVERED NINETEEN I THOUGHT AS I LEFT MY STAFF AND HOME AND I WAS LIKE IT'S A COMMITTEE WHO UNDERSTANDS THESE ISSUES AND I I'M ALSO PERSONALLY GRATEFUL FOR THAT LEADERSHIP AND INSIGHT AND UNDERSTANDING OF THESE ISSUES THAT YOU ALL BRING BECAUSE WE TALK A LOT ABOUT THE TANGIBLE BENEFITS OF. ESTABLISHING A OF A MEDICAL SCHOOL IN A PARTICULAR REGION AND- WHETHER IT TRAINS DOCTORS AND WERE ABLE TO RE TRAINED WE RETAIN PHYSICIANS AND- WEAVES THROUGH THE- SUPPORT OF THE ADMINISTRATION. THIS GOVERNOR AND THE FORMER GOVERNOR WE'VE DIRECTED. SURPRISINGLY BUT THANKFULLY STATE MONEY TOWARD THE ESTABLISHMENT OF ADDITIONAL RESIDENCY PROGRAMS BOTH. AS THROUGH THE TOBACCO TAX MEASURE IN SONG BROWN IN ADDITION TO THE FEDERAL MONEY THAT FLOWS TO US THROUGH- OF THE MEDIC HERE A RELATED PROGRAMS- BUT THEY'RE ALSO INTANGIBLE BENEFITS TO ESTABLISHING. A MEDICAL SCHOOL IN A REGION THAT ARE ALMOST IN SOME CASES IN CAPABLE OF BEING MEASURED OR QUANTIFIED AND YOU'RE- YOU HAVE SOMEBODY TALKING WHO CONSTANTLY SPEAKS ABOUT GOALS AND OBJECTIVES AND METRICS. BUT I DO READ RECOGNIZE ON OCCASION THERE ARE INTANGIBLE BENEFITS THEY'RE HARD TO MEASURE YET ARE JUST AS VALUABLE. AS THE TANGIBLE STUFF SO I DON'T WANT TO BE. SEND YOUR TRAIN OFF THE TRACK BUT I WANT TO MAKE SURE WE GET TO HOW WE- DO WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. WITH THE ADMINISTRATION SUPPORT IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND WE HAVE THESE OPTIONS AND I REALIZE THEIR POLITICS UP THERE AND- WE ALWAYS HAVE TO BE COGNIZANT OF THAT SO. OKAY IS SO I'M A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF WORK WITH THE UCSF LEADERSHIP MY DIRECT INVOLVEMENT WITH THE PRESIDENT'S SUPPORT WITH MERCED WITH UCSF FRESNO ON WE HAD THE BENEFIT OF THE STATE'S INVESTMENT IN OUR SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY PRIME PROGRAM I'M AN ORIGINAL ARCHITECT OF THE PRIME PROGRAM THAT STANDS FOR STANDS FOR PROGRAMS IN MEDICAL EDUCATION. BEST AB PROGRAM IS OUR ONLY GEOGRAPHICALLY DESIGNATED PRIME PROGRAM MEANING IT FOCUSES ON THE REGION SO WE'VE GOT OTHERS ON- BUT THAT FOCUS OF AIR SO THAT ONE POINT EIGHT FIVE FIVE MILLION THAT THAT WAS PROVIDED A SEVERAL YEARS AGO WAS MODELED ON A MEDICAL STUDENT- CONTRIBUTION OF THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR MEDICAL STUDENTS THIS DOESN'T COVER THE COST. INSTRUCTION OR SUPERVISION COSTS ARE HIGHER WHEN YOU HAVE SMALLER CLASSES THIS COMES ALSO WITH TUITION BUT THAT WAS THE MODEL AND THE BASIS FOR THAT FIGURE- AT THAT TIME SO THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS PER STUDENT. TO SUPPORT AN ULTIMATE TOTAL ENROLLMENT OF FORTY EIGHT MEDICAL STUDENTS COOPER CLASS- LAST YEAR WITH THE INCOMING- CLASS OF FIRST YEAR MEDICAL STUDENTS. BY LEADERSHIP AGREEMENT WITH A COMMITMENT ON THIS REGION WE MIGRATED TO- DEAL SAMMY ACCREDITING SCHOOL FOR AS JV FROM THE DAVIS CAMPUS. TO UCSF AND THIS IS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF CALENDARS AND TO LEVERAGE THAT RELATIONSHIP AT UCSF AND THE RESPONSIBILITY THE UCSF HOUSE. FOR GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION SO THIS WAS A SHARED DECISION THAT THIS WAS IN THE REGION'S BEST INTEREST TO MY GREAT THIS. IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN- AND I WOULD SAY THAT LEADERSHIP- COMMITMENT TO WORKING ON THIS ACROSS LOCATIONS HAS BEEN HIGH AND GENUINE IT'S BEEN A PRIVILEGE FOR ME TO BE PART OF IT- THROUGHOUT WE RETAIN DELOITTE ON TO HELP US LOOK ON. LOOK AT MODELS AND SO THIS WAS NOT ANTICIPATING THE THIS YEAR'S GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THIS WAS TO MOVE FORWARD WITH A VISION FOR WHAT MIGHT BE POSSIBLE FOR EXPANDING MEDICAL EDUCATION. SO WE LOOKED AT A HYBRID MODEL WE LOOKED AT TWO YEARS AT UCSF. FOR BASIC SCIENCES TWO YEARS AT FRESNO WE LOOK AT A FULL BRANCH CAMPUS MODEL THAT WOULD REQUIRE GREATER INVESTMENT RIGHT WITH TWO YEARS AT UCSF FRESNO WARMER SAID. THERE'S VALUE IN CONTINUITY OF MEDICAL EDUCATION IN OUR REGION. AND WE LOOK AT A JOINT MODEL WITH- SO EITHER BASIC SCIENCES AT UCSF. FRESNO OR AT RISK SAID BUT RECOGNIZING WE NEED TO BUILD THE INFRASTRUCTURE AND CAPABILITY FOR TEACHING. AS WE CONTINUE THE DISCUSSIONS WITH THIS- WITH THIS LEADERSHIP GROUP AND THINKING ABOUT THE FUTURE WE BEGAN TO TALK ABOUT AN ALTERNATIVE MODEL AND THAT WAS FIRST PROPOSED IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN AND THAT MODEL IS- UNIQUE WITHIN THE STATE- AND ALIGNS. VERY NICELY WITH THE NEEDS AND THE VISION FOR THIS PROGRAM- GOING FORWARD THIS WOULD BE A COMBINED. AND THE ONLY SUCH PROGRAM OF ITS TYPE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHICH WOULD BE A COMBINED BACCALAUREATE- MD PROGRAM. THIS WOULD BE AN EIGHT YEAR PROGRAM. WITH INCOMING FRESHMEN- ADMITTED TO A- TRACK IN A PROGRAM WITH ACADEMIC ENRICHMENT AND SUPPORT AND GUIDANCE. FUNNELING THEM THROUGH- A PROCESS. LEADING TO A BACCALAUREATE DEGREE FROM UC MERCED. AT AND ENABLING THEN THE TRANSITION TO BECOME A FIRST YEAR MEDICAL STUDENT. WHERE FROM WHERE FOUNDATIONS IN MEDICAL EDUCATION COULD BE TAUGHT AGAIN. CONTINGENT AS- MY CAN COLLEAGUES TO THE RIGHT OF OBSERVED ON ADEQUATE. STABLE FUNDING TO SUPPORT EDUCATION WE CAN'T STOP AND START THESE THINGS AND PUT OUR CAMPUS REPUTATIONS AT RISK FOR OUR STUDENTS AT RISK TO ACT AND THIS DOES REQUIRE ADVANCE INVESTMENT FOR THE REASONS THE CHAMP ON DEAN HAVE DESCRIBED WE NEED TO HAVE THE FACULTY IN PLACE TO DO THIS. BUT STUDENTS COULD COMPLETE THEIR UNDERGRADUATE DEGREE. ON THE LCM ME- WOULD RECOGNIZE UNDER THIS MODEL AND WE'RE DOING- A GREAT DEAL OF ACTIVE MODELING AS WE SPEAK AND THERE WILL BE THE ABILITY TO COME BACK. I THINK AND THREE TO FOUR WEEKS WITH MORE DETAIL ON BUDGET AND USE AND SITE AND TIMING- BUT BUT I'M PREPARED TO SPEAK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT MAY BE POSSIBLE- TODAY SO THIS EIGHT YEAR PROGRAM- COULD POTENTIALLY. INTENTION AGAIN UPON STABLE OPERATING ROSE- REVENUES AT ADMITTED CLASS OF TWELVE STUDENTS WITH THE FALL CLASS OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO- WHICH IN MEDICAL EDUCATION. THESE WOULD NOT BE MEDICAL STUDENTS THESE WOULD BE FRESHMEN RIGHT I MEAN SO THE ADMISSIONS IS AHEAD OF OUR- WITH MISSION PROCESS IS THE HEAD OF THE MOVE OF STUDENTS TO CAMPUS TO BEGIN AN ACADEMIC PROGRAMS. THE CURRENT YEAR AND NEXT WOULD BE AIMED AT AT PLANNING- PREPARATION OF MERCED FACULTY INVESTMENT OF INFRASTRUCTURE TO ENABLE THIS POSSIBILITY BUT THIS IS- WHERE WE ARE IN DIALOGUE WHICH IS. VERY ACTIVE- AMONG THE LEADERSHIP OF THE SITES THAT I HAVE NAMED- IF THIS WERE POSSIBLE. THE UC MERCED CAMPUS COULD OPERATE AS A REGIONAL CAMPUS OF THE UCSF SCHOOL OF MEDICINE. WHERE SITE IS NOT AUTHORIZED OR CREDITED BY THE LCM ME AND WOULD NOT HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE ANYTIME IN THE NEA FUTURE AND ON ITS OWN SO THIS LEVERAGES CAPABILITY AND SCALE OF A LONGSTANDING TOP MEDICAL SCHOOL IN THIS COUNTRY BY ABILITY WHICH I AGAIN WE'VE SETTLED LAW ALL ALONG ITS MISSION ALIGNED WE KNOW HOW TO DO THIS- THE FACULTY AT RISK SAID. WOULD HAVE TO BE RECRUITED TO DO THIS TEACHING THERE IS NO MEDICAL SCHOOL FACULTY EVEN FOR A SMALL COHORT pNEED TO BE IN A POSITION TO TEACH THE UCS OF CURRICULUM SO THE L. SAMMY REQUIRES- COMPARABILITY. INDEPENDENT OF GEOGRAPHY GEOGRAPHIC SITE MERCED WOULD NOT HAVE DEGREES OF FREEDOM TO DO SOMETHING LAST BECAUSE IT WAS A NEW PROGRAM. STUDENTS IN A UCS UP PROGRAM REGARDLESS OF SITE WE NEED TO BE ASSURED OF THE SAME ACCESS TO ACADEMIC RESEARCH IS THE SAME CALIBER OF INSTRUCTION THE SAME LEVEL OF OVERSIGHT PREPARING THEM TO GRADUATE WITH A MEDICAL DEGREE SO JUST SO I UNDERSTAND IT'S SOMETHING SIMILAR BUT NOT. TOTALLY SIMILAR TO WHAT UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA RIVERSIDE HAD BEEN DOING FOR YEARS PRIOR TO TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN SO THE STUDENTS WHO WERE ADMITTED WOULD COMPLETE THEIR FOR YOU THE NORMAL FOUR YEARS OF AN UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAM HOWEVER THERE ADMITTED. AND THEN COMPLETE THE FIRST TWO YEARS OF THE BASIC SCIENCE. CURRICULUM FOR OF THE MEDICAL SCHOOL CURRICULUM. IF THIS PLAN HAPPENS TO BE THE ONE THAT'S ADOPTED. AT THE UC MERCED CAMPUS. TAUGHT IN THOSE TWO YEARS USING THE UCSF. CARRILLO CURRICULUM BY. A RECRUITED FACULTY WHO ARE. ACCUSTOMED TO TEACHING MEDICAL STUDENTS. AND THEN MOVING IN IT THERE'S ACTUALLY I WON'T TAKE THAT COMMITTEES TIME THIS THIS MORNING BECAUSE THE DOUBLES IN THE DETAIL AND IT THIS IS COMPLEX TERRITORY THAT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE GET RIGHT. ON BUT WE ACTUALLYBE CLOSER TO ABOUT EIGHTEEN MONTHS THAT WOULD BE AT UC MERCED TO ALIGN WITH UCSF PRACTICES OF TO. SPLIT INTO A BRIDGES CURRICULUM THAT LAND WOULD END ITSELF- BUT BUT FOR OBSERVATION THAT THIS WOULD BE THE UCSF CURRICULUM. IS RIGHT BECAUSE IT WOULD BE REQUIRED IN ORDER FOR YOU CASF TO BE THE DEGREE GRANTING- MEDICAL SCHOOL FOR THE STUDENTS AND THEN AFTER THAT EIGHTEEN MONTHS LATER YOU SEE MERCED A FLIP SOMEWHERE THEY WOULD THEY WOULD GO TO THE REGIONAL CAMPUS A SECOND REGIONAL CAMPUS OF UCSF WHICH IS YOU CASF- PRESENT PRESS NO. FOR CLINICAL CLERKSHIPS MOST OF WHICH ARE LONG ESTABLISHED AND THEY WOULD COMPLETE SELECTIVE ROTATIONS WHERE THOSE EXIST WHICH IS A SUBSTANTIAL ARRAY. MEDICAL STUDENTS SOMETIMES ROTATE TO OTHER INSTITUTIONS DEPENDING UPON THE SPECIALTY THEY MIXED SO THAT WOULDN'T PRECLUDE THAT OPTION- THE BENEFIT HERE. IS THAT THIS PROGRAM WOULD BE INTENTIONALLY DESIGNED IN A MANNER THAT IS VERY YOU UNIQUE BY EITHER I'M VERY FAMILIAR WITH THE HISTORY OF THE RIVERSIDE PROGRAM. AND YOU'RE CORRECT THAT THERE ARE SIMILARITIES BUT THERE ARE IMPORTANT DIFFERENCES- ADMISSION OF STUDENTS INTO THIS TRACK IS TO INCOMING FRESHMEN. WOULD BE PRIORITIZED FOR STUDENTS FROM THE REGION. RIGHT THE THIS THAT THIS PROGRAM WOULD BE NOT LOOKING TO ADMIT STUDENTS FROM WEST WOULD. OR SAN DIEGO THE STUDENT WOULD THAT THIS PROGRAM WOULD PRIORITIZE. THE RECRUITMENT OF INCOMING FRESHMEN WITH TIES TO THE TO THE BROADER REGION NOT JUST MERCED COUNTY BUT THE BROADER AND BROADER INLAND EMPIRE AND YOU SEE THAT BY HIGH SCHOOL LOCATION FAMILY TIES ALL THE THINGS THAT YOU WOULD KNOW WELL. IT MUST BE AN INNOVATIVE PROGRAM SO YOU'RE IN YOU'RE IN ESSENCE TAKING WHAT THE MEDICAL SCHOOL CURRENTLY DOES FOR MEDICAL STUDENTS AND EXPANDING IT. MOVING IT BACK TO THE BEGINNING OF THE COLLEGE EDUCATION EXPERIENCE AND THERE ARE FEW OF THESE PROGRAMS IN THE UNITED STATES THEY HAVE A RECORD. OF SUCCESS IN TERMS OF DIVERSITY- THERE ARE NOT MANY THIS WOULD HAVE THE ADDED BENEFIT OF BEING UNIQUE AMONG. ACADEMIC OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE UC MERCED CAMPUS- WHICH IS ALSO LIKE RIVERSIDE GROWING QUICKLY- WITH WITH STUDENTS WHO COME FROM THE REGION IS INCOMING UNDERGRADUATES. ON THIS WOULD BE A DIFFERENTIATOR BECAUSE IT WOULD BE THE ONLY EIGHT YEAR PROGRAM. YES AND MD IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- AND ALL COME COME BACK FOR ONE MINUTE ON. THE RELEVANCE OF THESE INVESTMENTS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE'VE WE'VE NOT APPRECIATE. BANDED MEDICAL STUDENT ENROLLMENT OPPORTUNITIES- FOR DECADES. AND TELL. RIVERSIDE WE HAVE A PRIME INITIATIVE WHICH IS NOT A TOPIC FOR TODAY BUT THAT WAS SOME ENROLLMENT EXPANSION. WITHIN OUR EXISTING SCHOOLS. THERE IS THERE ARE STILL NOT INVESTMENT OF STATE FUNDING FOR TWO THIRDS OF THOSE SLOTS- BUT WHAT WE DO KNOW IS WORTH THE BOTTOM IN THE NATION AND MEDICAL STUDENT OPPORTUNITIES. FOR STUDENTS ATTENDING MEDICAL SCHOOL IN THE NATION BUT- WE ARE AT THE TOP OF THE NATION IN TERMS OF THE RETENTION OF CALIFORNIA STUDENTS WE EDUCATE HERE AND THAT IS MISSION ALIGNED SO FOUR OF OUR SIX UC MEDICAL SCHOOLS ADMIT A 100% CALIFORNIA'S STUDENTS YOU SEE A SEVEN UCLA DID YOU TAKE STUDENTS- FROM OTHER STATES WHO ARE EXCEPTIONALLY- COMPETITIVELY ELIGIBLE. BUT WE KNOW CALIFORNIA STUDENTS WHO WANT TO STAY HERE ON ONE REMAIN HERE THEIR FAMILY TIES AND SO IF THERE IS PROOF AND EVIDENCE OF THE VALUE OF THE RETURN ON THE INVESTMENT OF STATE RESOURCES WHICH WE'VE- NOT UNFORTUNATELY SEEN VERY LITTLE OF- BUT BUT I THINK THE PREDICTIVE VALUE OF INVESTING IN. YOU SEE AS THE STATE'S PUBLIC MEDICAL SCHOOLS THE PRIORITIZE THE ADMISSION AND TRAINING OF OUR OWN CALIFORNIA STUDENTS HAS PROVEN A RETURN ON THE INVESTMENT BY EVERY NATIONAL MEASURE- SO THIS IS WHERE WE- WHERE WE ARE WE BELIEVE THAT WE WOULD BE IN A POSITION WITH MORE DETAILS TO FOLLOW TO IT TO ADMIT- IN. FALL TWENTY TWENTY TWO- PORT OF THE FIRST WE WOULD CONTINUE OUR S. JB PRIME PROGRAM. SO THIS IS A MEDICAL SCHOOL WE WOULD COULD BEGIN A FRESHMAN PROGRAM IT MERCED. CRIME WOULD CONTINUE IT AND WILL RAMP TO TWELVE STUDENTS AT UCSF- WITH WITH THE CLASS NEXT YEAR- UCSF HAS RE ORDER ORIENTED THEIR OUTREACH TO STUDENTS TO PREFERENTIALLY ADMIT AND RECRUIT TIME STUDENTS FROM THE VALLEY. FOR PRIME THERE IS IN A IN A MORE ROBUST WAY THAT WE THINK WILL ADD SOME VALUE. I'M HAPPY TO TAKE WELL I JUST WANT TO TELL YOU HOW SUPPORT OF I AM AND HOW DELIGHTED I AM TO HEAR THIS AND PROBABLY NO MORE SO THAN MY COLLEAGUES FROM THE CENTRAL VALLEY BUT IT IS A VERY IMPORTANT REGION OF THE STATE AND JUST AS WE ADVOCATE FOR THOSE OF US WHO REPRESENT INLAND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA THE NEEDS ARE ESSENTIALLY. CERTAINLY THE SAME IF NOT IN SOME CASES GREATER IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND WE NEED TO FOCUS ON THAT AND I AM. COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH YOU AND DOING WHATEVER I CAN TO- HELP WHATEVER THE FINAL PLAN IS- SUCCEEDS SO. YES THE ONLY OTHER COMMENT I WANT TO MAKE FOR THE FOR THIS GROUP THIS MORNING. AND I'M WE'RE HAPPY TO CONTINUE- AS IT WE HAVE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION WHICH IS LITERALLY WEEKLY THE LEVEL OF INTENSITY OF WORK ON THIS IS HIGH AND- AND GENUINE IS. WE HAVE INTENTIONALLY COME TOGETHER OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS INCLUDING THIS ALTERNATIVE MODEL. TO CREATE A FOUNDATION AND A BONAFIDE FUTURE PATHWAY. FORMER SAID TO ALTERNATELY BECOME AN INDEPENDENT LCM THE MEDICAL SCHOOL. SO THIS THIS BUILDING OF THE OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE AND THE TEACHING CAPABILITY WITH A SMALL PROGRAM LEVERAGING UCSF. ACCREDITATION PAVES THE WAY NOT ONLY FOR GROWTH AGAIN OPERATING MONEY SEE FOR ME RIVERSIDE TO GO FROM SEVENTY FIVE SEVENTY SEVEN STUDENTS TO ONE TWENTY FIVE WE NEED ADDITIONAL FACULTY. THIS PROGRAM WOULD START SMALL- BUT IT WOULD HAVE CONCURRENT NUMBERS OF MEDICAL STUDENTS AND UNDERGRADUATES RIGHT THAT COULD SCALE TO- FULLY ENROLLED SCHOOL OF MEDICINE ONE DAY OF BEFORE THE WISH OF THE STATE AND THERE WERE THE ADEQUACY OF INVESTMENTS THAT'S WITH. SOMETHING THAT'S VERY UNIQUE AN INTENTIONAL TO CREATE A PATH FORWARD- THAT DISTINCT WOULD INCREASE AT LIKE THREE HUNDRED EACH STAGE MY- LAW SCHOOL PROFESSOR SAID BY THE EDGES TO SENSE BY THE YARD IT'S HARD. I THINK INCREMENTAL IS THE WAY TO GO IT'S NOT OFTEN WHAT WE DO HERE IN SACRAMENTO BUT- WITH THE GOVERNOR'S CELL MOVES ALONG. YES IF I COULD I'M JUST GOING TO REFLECT ON THIS CONVERSATION RELATIVE TO THE UC OUR HISTORY I WE'RE WE'RE PROUD OF OUR HISTORY BUT IF AND WHEN I SIT AND THINK ABOUT WHAT IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN. IF IN NINETEEN NINETY OR NINETEEN EIGHTY OR SOME TO THE DATE. WE HAVE HAD THE SAME KIND OF LONG TERM VISION. MR WE HAD A VISION FOR TWO YEARS AND RESIDE TWO YEARS IN A WAY WHICH WAS A GREAT VISION AND IT SERVED US WELL BUT IF WE HAD THOUGHT BOUT THE LONG TERM TRAJECTORY OF OUR MEDICAL SCHOOL. IN IN RIVERSIDE IN THE LONG TERM PROJECT WE HAVE STUDENTS LIKE MARLENE AND BY WHAT THEIR LIFE WOULD BE THAT'S THAT'S THE BEAUTY I THINK OF THIS PROPOSAL IT IT HAS A DIFFERENT SENSE OF RESPONSIBILITY FOR ALL OF US. AND FOR THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE LEGISLATURE TO THINK ABOUT AYE AYES STREAM OF FUNDING OFTEN THE FUTURES HEART- TO THAT'S- THE HARDEST PART OF YOUR JOB AND IT HAS AT THE CENTER RESPONSIBLY FOR US. IN MERCED NOW THERE WILL BE AN INSTITUTIONAL COMMITMENT IN A AND IT'S MERCED BUT IT'S THE WHOLE UC TO A GROUP OF STUDENTS WERE FRESHMEN- THAT'S A DIFFERENT KIND OF RESPONSIBILITY SET AND I THINK IT'S ST TO DOCTOR NATION'S CREDIT TO LOTS OF OTHER PEOPLE'S CREDIT THAT WE'RE STARTING TO THINK THAT WAY. AND IT'S TO ALL OF YOU I APPRECIATE AGAIN YOUR SUPPORT FOR LETTING US THINK IN A MORE HOLISTIC WAY. IT'S HUGE. I AGREE. WELL INCREMENTALLY IT. OF EASIER TO HANDLE BOTH FROM A BUDGET STANDPOINT AND OTHERWISE- IN TERMS OF PLANNING AND TESTING IN DECIDING WHAT WORKS AND WHAT DOESN'T WORK SO AGAIN I LOOK FORWARD I'M DELIGHTED THAT YOU ARE MOVING DOWN THIS PATH I THANK THE GOVERNOR AND THE ADMINISTRATION FOR RECOGNIZING THE NEED TO HAVE NOT ONLY SUPPORTING. SCHOOL ANALYSTS OF THE CALIFORNIA OF COURSE BUT RECOGNIZING THE NEED IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY IN WHAT SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES BOTH HERE AND CERTAINLY OVER IN THE ASSEMBLY HAVE BEEN WORKING ON FOR MANY MANY YEARS SO WE'LL MAKE IT HAPPEN. ANY QUESTIONS SO EVERY ROW THANK YOU SON ANY COMMENTS FROM. THE FOLKS OVER TO MY RIGHT WHO PROVIDE US WITH ADVICE AND HELP. COME ON CASEY. NO I JUST WANTED TO CLARIFY A YOU HAD ASKED ABOUT THE. THE STATUS UPDATE ON THE FACILITY THAT WAS AUTHORIZED IN MERCED AND SHE WANTED TO CLARIFY MAYBE THIS DIDN'T COME OUT BUT WE HAD BEEN. SIGNAL BY THE UNIVERSITY THAT WAS INTENDING TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THE FACILITY PROJECT- WITHOUT NECESSARILY RE SUBMITTING A PROPOSAL- THEY WERE PLANNING TO AUTHORIZE IT- THIS DISC THIS ARE COMING FEW MONTHS I JUST TO GET MORE UPDATED ON INFORMATION ON THAT JUST TO CLARIFY ITS REAL LEGISLATURE'S EXPECTATION OF WHAT THAT APPROVAL PROCESS SHOULD LOOK LIKE. COULD BE THAT COULD BE BENEFICIAL TO EXPLORE THAT THIS YEAR WILL IS A PROCESS FOR THAT. THE FINANCING. YOU'VE HEARD THE LAST CONVERSATION SO HAPPY TO PARTICIPATE IN THAT TO WHATEVER THE- WHATEVER COMES FORWARD WE HAVE A FEW MONTHS YEAH. EXACTLY AND I WILL SAY THAT THAT. THAT AIM ON AND THIS REGION I COULD BE SITTING ON BEHALF OF RIVERSIDE IF THE RIVERSIDE TEAM WERE WERE ELSEWHERE I'M IF THE PRIVILEGE TO BE A PARTNER WITH RIVERSIDE EVERY DAY. BUT MANY OF THE SAME OBSERVATIONS APPLY THE VITAL IMPORTANCE OF FULL FUNDING TO ENABLE US TO DO WHAT WE CAN. RELATED TO ACCREDITATION IT RELATES TO RECRUITMENT IT RELATES TO YOU KNOW TO PREDICTIONS OF SUCCESS- AND HAD A HAD SORT OF A HALF WAY FIFTEEN MILLION WOULD BE INCREMENTAL TO STARTING. NOT SCALING A FULL MEDICAL SCHOOL THAT WOULD BE THERE INCOME ON THAT FIFTEEN MILLION WOULD OR NOT NOT ENABLE US O LAUNCH A SMALL PROGRAM. AND WOULD CALL INTO QUESTION THE LEVEL OF STATE COMMITMENT SORT OF GOING FORWARD WE CAN'T SEND OUR TEAM OFF ANA. ACROSS STATE JOURNEY SORT OF WITH A- TANK OF GAS AND SAYING WE- REFILL WHEN YOU WHEN YOU GET THERE AND WE ARE PLANNING INTENTIONALLY- FOR PROGRAM THAT COULD EXIST OF THEIR STUDY. IF THERE CITY OPERATING REVENUE THE LEVEL THAT HAS BEEN PROPOSED WELL OF COURSE THIS IS ALL OF IN THIS FORTUNATE THAT THE GOVERNOR PUT THIS IN THE JANUARY BUT BUT PROPOSED. SO IT'S COSTING US IS GIVING US THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE A CONVERSATION WHAT IS ACTUALLY REQUIRED IS A DETAILED PLAN YOU SEE AS TO WHAT. BUT CAN TO DO. WHAT THE TIMING IS. HOW IT'S GOING TO BE STAGED. WHAT THE COST ELEMENTS ARE. SO WE CAN MAKE DETERMINATIONS AND CERTAINLY THE GOVERNOR AND THE ADMINISTRATION CAN MAKE DECISIONS. ALONG WITH US AS TO HOW HOW WE PAY FOR THIS AND WHEN WE PAY FOR IT AND WHAT THE BUDGET ALLOWS US TO AFFORD IN ANY GIVEN YEAR SO. I LOOK FORWARD TO GETTING THE DETAIL. OF FROM YOU ALL AS I'M SURE- JASON DOES AND DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND THEN WE'LL WORK THROUGH AND SEE WHAT WE CAN DO. BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY IT'S MY INTENT TO TRY TO MAKE SOMETHING HAPPEN AT SOME POINT IN TIME FOR PEOPLE WHO BADLY NEEDED IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY SO THANK YOU. BRING US THANK YOU ALL FOR COMING. DRIVING FLYING. WHATEVER IT IS DO IT SAFELY AND STAY HEALTHY. OKAY NEXT ISSUE IS ISSUE NUMBER THREE BUDGET OPERATIONS AND TUITION. YOU. THANK YOU TERRY ROTH OF I'M GOING TO BE REFERRING BACK TO THE ORANGE COVERED HAND OUT THAT YOU RECEIVED EARLIER. AND BEFORE I GET INTO THE DETAILS OF THE UNIVERSITY'S BUDGET REQUEST I'D LIKE TO WALK YOU THROUGH A LITTLE BIT OF CONTEXT WITHIN WHICH YOU'LL BE MAKING THE DECISIONS ABOUT. ABOUT THE UNIVERSITY'S BUDGET SO I WOULD DIRECT YOU TO SLIDE FOUR. OF WHICH DEMONSTRATES THE UNIVERSITY'S OVERALL BUDGET SITUATION ON THE LEFT THERE YOU SEE THE PIE CHART OF THE DOUGHNUT CHART. THAT SHOWS ALL OF THE UNIVERSITY SOURCES OF FUNDS AND WHEN THE LEGISLATURE IS CONSIDERING OF ADDITIONAL FUNDS FOR THE UNIVERSITY ARE THE CAMPUS OPERATING FUNDS THAT WE USUALLY DISCUSS YOUR LOOKING AT THAT BLUE SLICE THERE WHICH- IS ALSO SHOWN IN A- BLOWN UP WAY ON THE RIGHT HAND SLIDE. RIGHT HAND SIDE OF THE SLIDE THAT IS OUR CORE OPERATING FUNDS THAT'S WHAT PAYS FOR OUR CAMPUS OPERATIONS INSTRUCTION STUDENT SERVICES- AND ALL OF THOSE. THINGS THAT IT TAKES TO RUN AN ACTUAL CAMPUS. IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT FOR TO CAMP SAYS STATE GENERAL FUNDS ARE ABOUT 42% OF THE CAMPUS OPERATIONS AT TOP. OF THE MEANS THAT STUDENT FEES HAVE TO STEP UP. AND COVER A SIGNIFICANT COMPONENT OF THE CAMPUS OPERATIONS. OF IT ALSO MEANS THAT ANY INCREASE THE STATE GENERAL FUNDS UNLESS IT'S SIGNIFICANT IS NOT ENOUGH TO COVER INFLATIONARY COSTS FOR ALL CAMPUS OPERATIONS BECAUSE THEY'RE ONLY AN INCREASE ON OF ONE COMPONENT OF OUR FUNDING. THEN ON SLIDE FIVE I HAVE A QUICK SNAPSHOT OF THE REGION'S BUDGET REQUEST THE LEGISLATURE AND FOR TWENTY TWENTY ONE WE ARE REQUESTING FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY THREE MILLION IN NEW ON GOING FUNDING. AT AND I'LL GET INTO THE DETAILS OF THAT SOON. BUT THESE BONDS WOULD ALLOW US TO INVEST IN INSTRUCTION OF COVER ARE MANDATORY BASED COST INCREASES OF. INVEST IN NEW STUDENT SUPPORT SERVICES AND SUPPORT ENROLLMENT FOR CALIFORNIA UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS GRADUATE STUDENTS A MEDICAL STUDENTS. THEN ON SLIDE SIX OF I SUMMARIZE WHAT THE GOVERNOR PROVIDED THAT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. CAN I STOP YOU FOR A SECOND JUST GO BACK SO THAT WAS AN INTERESTING COMMENT YOU MADE SO WHEN WE- WHEN WE PROVIDE A- WHATEVER YOU WANT TO CALL IT A COAL- OR AN INCREASE. IN AND WE DO IT ON THE GENERAL FUND SIDE AND I'M LOOKING AT. PAGE FOUR YES. SO IF YOUR COST OF OPERATION GOES UP AND WE SAY OKAY WE'RE GOING TO INCREASE YOU BY 3% THAT'S OUR PIECE OF THE FUNDING. IN ORDER TO KEEP YOU HOLE IF IN FACT YOU COST OF OPERATION GOES UP THEN. YOU WOULD NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE MEDICAL CENTER REVENUE INCREASES THE IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING THE MEDICAL CENTER REVENUE IN INCREASES BY BY 3% THE- FORT FOR THE CENTRAL CAMPUS OPERATIONS WE WOULD NEED TO STUDENT TUITION. THE NON RESIDENT TUITION AND THEN A FEW OTHER SMALLER- FUNDING SOURCES TO ALSO INCREASE SO THE CENTRAL CAMPUS ARE PAID FOR WITH STATE GENERAL FUNDS. TUITION STUDENT SERVICES BE NON RESIDENT TUITION WHICH NOW IS 15% OF CAMPUS OPERATIONS. AND THEN IN THAT LITTLE YELLOW SLICE THERE THAT SAYS 4% THAT'S- THINGS LIKE PATENTS REVENUE INDIRECT COST RECOVERY IN A COUPLE OF OTHER. SMALL REFUSE OR SUGGEST. REVENUE STATE THE MEDICAL CAMPUS THAT'S CORRECT OKAY THAT'S CORRECT OF THE MEDICAL HER REP DUE SOMETIME SUBSIDIZED MEDICAL EDUCATION BUT WE THE CALL EDUCATION COMPONENT. OF CAPS OPERATION. OKAY I DIDN'T MEAN. I'M TAKING EVERY UP THE TRACKS TO THE BUT I ALWAYS TRY I LOVE OUR- I LOOK AFFECTED. LOOKING AT THE SLIDES AND REALLY. REALLY WANTING TO KNOW WHAT WE'RE WHAT WE'RE ALL ABOUT- SO LIKE I SAID SLIDE SIX. SUMMARIZES THE GOVERNOR'S JANUARY TEN BUDGET WE'RE VERY VERY GRATEFUL TO THE GOVERNOR. FOR PROVIDING US WITH A 5% INCREASE TO- OF THE ON GOING CAMPUS STATE GENERAL FUND. OF BUT LIKE I JUST TALKED ABOUT SINCE THAT'S 42% OF THE OPERATIONS FOR THE CAMPUSES IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO COVER THE INFLATIONARY COST INCREASE FOR. THE ENTIRE CAMPUS OPERATIONS SO IF YOU TAKE THAT OF 5% OF THE GOVERNOR GAVE US AND YOU STRETCH ACROSS ALL OF THE CAMPUS OPERATIONS. IT ACTUALLY BECOMES ABOUT A 2% INCREASE. SO IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO COVER THE TWO POINT 8% INFLATION THAT WE'RE FACING RIGHT NOW SO WHERE YOU GET THE EXTRA MONEY. WELL WE'LL GET TO THAT WILL- WE'RE ASKING YOU FOR IT- AND WE MAY WE MAY BE TURNING TO OUR STUDENTS HERE VERY SHORTLY. OF FOR SHERIFF THAT. AND ON SLIDE SEVEN I SUMMARIZE THE FUNDING NEEDS OF THE UNIVERSITY. IN ADDITION TO THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET AND JUST ON A VERY HIGH LEVEL WE'RE REQUESTING ANOTHER TWO HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN ADDITION TO THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. OF THE LARGEST COMPONENT OF OUR BUDGET REQUEST IS SUSTAINING THE CORE OPERATIONS OF THE CAMPUSES IN ORDER TO RETAIN THE MOST QUALIFIED FACULTY AND STAFF CONTINUE TO PROVIDE STUDENT SERVICES MAINTAIN OUR FACILITIES AND ENSURE THAT THE UNIVERSITY FOR RETIREMENT PLAN IS FUNCTIONING AS INTENDED THERE'S ADDITIONAL COST OF RUNNING THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT TEN CAMPUS SYSTEM THE REGION'S HAVE REQUESTED TO STATE FOR AN ADDITIONAL TWO HUNDRED SIXTY FOUR POINT THREE MILLION FOR THOSE OF BASIC INFLATIONARY CRITICAL OPERATION COST INCREASES. AND WHILE IT SEEMS LIKE A HUGE AMOUNT OF THAT EQUATES TO JUST TWO POINT FUNDS. OF COURSE THE GENERAL FUND OF THE GOVERNOR HAS PROVIDED US WITH- HUNDRED AND SIXTY NINE POINT TWO MILLION FOR THE SPACE COST INCREASES THAT'S THE 5% THAT I JUST REFERRED TO- AND WHAT WE ARE SHORT STILL ON THOSE BASIC COST INCREASES NINETY FIVE MILLION. AS SHOWN AT THE TOP OF THE SLIDE SEVEN. NOW TO CONTINUE ON THE DISCUSSION OF. WHAT ARE THE COST PRESSURES AND WHERE HAVE WE BEEN AS THE SYSTEM MIGHT ASK YOU TO TURN TO SLIDE EIGHT. ON SLIDE EIGHT. I'M JUST I HAVE A VISUAL HERE ON THE FIRST STUDENT FOR FUNDS OF THE UNIVERSITY SO NINETY FIVE POINT ONE MILLION IS WHAT YOU NEED IN ORDER TO COVER OUR BASIC COST INFLATIONARY INCREASES IN ADDITION TO THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. AND SOURCE LIGHT EIGHT. YOU CAN- THIS GRAPH HERE DEMONSTRATES THAT THERE HAVE BEEN ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS INTO OUR STUDENTS AND THE PER STUDENT AMOUNT OF FUNDING IS ACTUALLY INCREASING FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE RECESSION TO NOW AND THE LEGISLATURE HAS BEEN VERY GENEROUS LOOK PROVIDING US ANNUAL INCREASES SINCE TWENTY TWELVE UNTIL NOW. UP TO ALLOW US TO INVEST IN OUR STUDENTS AND TO INCREASED ENROLLMENT IN THE UNIVERSITY BUT THERE ARE A FEW THINGS I'D LIKE YOU TO NOTE HERE ONE IS THE SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE NON RESIDENT TUITION. IN THE. SO ARE NON RESIDENT STUDENTS PAY OF. PAY QUITE A BIT THEY PAY ALMOST THIRTY THOUSAND AND NON RESIDENT SUPPLEMENTAL TUITION TO US OF THAT AMOUNT WE ONLY NEED ABOUT OF ELEVEN THOUSAND TO ACTUALLY EDUCATE THEM THE REST GOES INTO THE CAMPUS OPERATING BUDGETS TO HELP SUPPORT AND SUSTAIN THE INSTRUCTION AND OPERATIONS OF THE CAMPUSES ALL OUR STUDENTS. SO IF THOSE FUNDS ARE RESTRICTED THAT WOULD CREATE SOME PROBLEMS FOR OUR CAMPUSES WE'RE NOT PROPOSING THAT RIGHT OUT YOU'RE NOT PROPOSING THAT JUST WANTED TO MAKE THE POINT THAT IT WOULD IT WOULD GREAT UP SOME ISSUES FOR US. AND HOPEFULLY YOU WILL NOT CONTINUE TO NOT PROPOSED THAT. OF BUT THEN WE DO HAVE SOME ISSUES EVEN THOUGH THE FUNDING PER STUDENT HAS CONTINUED TO INCREASE SLIDE NINE DEMONSTRATES THAT THERE ARE CERTAIN COST INCREASES AS WELL THAT THE UNIVERSITY CAN'T AVOID. THAT ARE EATING INTO THAT PER STUDENT DOLLAR AMOUNT THAT WE HAVE OF ONE OF THE BIGGEST OF THESE IS UC RP THE UC RETIREMENT PROGRAM. UP FOR THIS COMING YEAR WE'RE GOING TO BE HAVING TO DISTRIBUTE OF FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY NINE MILLION FROM OUR CORE OPERATING FUNDS INTO OUR RETIREMENT PROGRAM. THAT REALLY REDUCES THE AMOUNT OF MONEY AVAILABLE OF FOR US TO AND JUST TO PUT SOME CONTEXT ON AT THE LEGISLATURE UP SINCE TWENTY TWELVE YOU'VE GROWN OUR BUDGET BY ONE POINT ONE BILLION DOLLARS. AND SO IF WE HAVE TO TAKE A FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY NINE MILLION INPUT INTO YOU SEPARATE THAT'S ABOUT HALF OF THOSE FUNDS THAT YOU'VE GIVEN TO US. GOING TO THIS PURPOSE THE ONLY RESTORED CUTS THE WEIRD THING. MADE IS THAT OVER AND ABOVE WHAT WE CUT OUT OF YOUR BUDGET AND- SO TWO THOUSAND AND BUDGET BY BILLION DOLLARS AND SINCE THEN YOU WERE STARTED BY ONE POINT ONE BILLION SO WE'RE ABOUT A HUNDRED MILLION HAD. WHERE WE WERE IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT AND THE FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY NINE. MILLION DOLLARS THAT'S OF A DOWN PAYMENT ON THE UNFUNDED LIABILITY AND ASSOCIATED WITH YOUR RETIREMENT. OF THAT IS NOT A DOWN PAYMENT ON THE UNFUNDED LIABILITY THAT'S JUST ON THE PAYROLL OF OUR CURRENT EMPLOYEES WORK WE HAVE TO PUT IN FOR THEM. SO AND- STRICTLY THE CONTRIBUTION SIDE AND THOSE ARE THE CONTRIBUTIONS THAT WERE RESTARTED IN TWENTY TEN. SO WHILE THE LEGISLATURE HAS BEEN GIVING US MONEY WE'VE BEEN HAVING TO RESTART THOSE CONTRIBUTIONS SO SIGNIFICANT CHUNK OF. THE NEW MONEY THAT YOU'RE GIVING TO US IS ACTUALLY GOING TO THE RETIREMENT PROGRAM. AND THE WAY WE SUPPLEMENT OUR BUDGET HAS BEEN WITH THOSE NON RESIDENT STUDENTS THAT'S HOW WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO GROW. AS HE IS GUYS SEEM TO HAVE AN UNFUNDED LIABILITY- YES HAVING GROWN NOW WITH OUR LATEST ACTUARIAL ARE UNFUNDED LIABILITY HAS GROWN TO EIGHTEEN BILLION. IS THAT ACCOUNTED FOR SOMEWHERE IN. NO NO IT'S NOT ACCOUNTED FOR HERE JUST JUST TO CLARIFY THAT- EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTION THAT THEY'RE MAKING A PORTION OF THAT IS COVERING EARNED BENEFITS EACH YEAR. AND THEN ANOTHER PORTION IS COVERING- OF A PORTION OF THE UNFUNDED LIABILITY OVER MANY YEARS JUST LIKE- CALPERS AND CAL STIRS YOU SEE- HAS A PLAN TO PAY DWN THE UNFUNDED LIABILITY OVER MANY YEARS AND THEY'RE- GOING TO ANSWER THEIR THEIR THEIR RATES INCLUDE THAT. ELEMENT ON THEIR THEIR PLAN DOESN'T PROVIDE ENOUGH FUNDING WE BETWEEN EMPLOYER AND EMPLOYEE CONTRIBUTIONS SO THEY'VE BEEN MAKING THE DIFFERENCE BY. OUR THROUGH INTERNAL BORROWING AND THEN THEY PAY OFF THAT INTERNAL BORROWING. OFF FROM THEIR FROM THEIR BUDGET TO. GET USER GET WELL DATE I MEAN WHATEVER GET WELL MEANS AND IN OUR PENSION SYSTEM BUT- IS THERE A GET WELL DATE UNDER THE PLAN. I'VE THEY'VE SHARED IF THE DATE IS A KIND OF A MOVING TARGET I DON'T REMEMBER THE MOST RECENT FAST BUT IT'S BEEN OVER A FEW FEW DECADES. WE HAVE TO FOLLOW UP TO GET. THE RATE. OKAY WHY BE INTERESTED IN AND AS WE CONTINUE OUR BUDGET CONVERSATIONS AND WE SPEND A LOT OF TIME CHATTING ABOUT PENSIONS NOT SO MUCH HERE IN THE HIGHER EDUCATION ARENA- WITH YOU SEE BUT I'D BE INTERESTED AT SOME POINT IN HAVING THAT INCLUDED AS PART OF OUR CONVERSATION JUST HAVE AN IDEA WHAT YOU'RE UNFUNDED. WE KNOW WHAT YOU'RE UNFUNDED LIABILITY IS BUT WHAT'S THE GET WELL PLAN I CAN BECAUSE I ASSUME THAT'S COMING OUT OF SOMETHING. OF IT IS COMING OUT OF OUR- OVERALL BUDGET UP IN COMMITTEE CONSULTANT AND- I CAN ALSO. BRING SOMEBODY BY TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THAT RIGHT IT'S BEYOND THE CONVERSATION TODAY IT JUST. SORT OF RELATED TO THE FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY NINE MILLION HECK YEAH SO AT SOME POINT WE CAN HAVE A FURTHER CONVERSATION ABOUT. EXACTLY EXACTLY PLEASE PROCEED OF AND OTHER- COST PRESSURES OF WE ALSO HAVE IS OUR DEATH SERVICE. OF BOTH ON THE GEO BOND SUPPORT TRANSFERRED INTO OUR BUDGETS. AND ALSO FOR THE AB NINETY FOUR PROCESS THAT WE'RE USING TO CONSTRUCT OUR BUILDINGS. THAT DOES SET ASIDE EVERY YEAR JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE OUT OF OUR OPERATING FUNDS THAT CAN THEN BE USED FOR HIRING OF INSTRUCTORS ARE STUDENT SERVICES- SO. THE LEGISLATURE HAS PROVIDED THE UNIVERSITY WITH. A SERIES OF DIRECTIVES OF REGARDING CALIFORNIA RESIDENT UNDERGRADUATE ENROLLMENT GROWTH TRANSFER AND ROMAN AND LIMITING NON RESIDENT UNDERGRADUATE ENROLLMENT AND THE UNIVERSITY HAS MET OR EXCEEDED EXCEEDED ALL THOSE EXPECTATIONS FOR NEW ENROLLMENT AND STUDENT SERVICES WITH MINIMAL INCREASES IN SYSTEM WIDE TUITION AND FEES OVER THE PAST EIGHT YEARS AND DOING SO HOWEVER HAS PUT PRESSURE ON THE UNIVERSITY'S ABILITY TO MAINTAIN A HIGH QUALITY EDUCATION FOR ITS GROWING STUDENT BODY AND WE CAN'T CONTINUE TO RESTRICT TUITION LVELS WITHOUT SIGNIFICANT STATE INVESTMENT. THE REGION'S HAVE BEEN DISCUSSING AND ARE CONSIDERING A VOTE ON MARCH NINETEENTH. ON A NEW TUITION STABILIZATION PLAN ONE OPTION BEING CONSIDERED UNDER THIS PLAN IS A COHORT BASED TUITION MODEL THIS MODEL WOULD INCREASE FEES FOR INCOMING STUDENTS ONLY. AND MAINTAIN THOSE FEES STUDY FOR SIX YEARS NO CURRENT STUDENTS WOULD SEE A SYSTEM WIDE BE INCREASE UNDER THE COHORT BASED TUITION MODEL. THIS MODEL WILL PROVIDE PREDICTABILITY TO UC SYSTEM WIDE STUDENT CHARGES AND ALLOW FAMILIES TO PLAN FOR THE COST OF EDUCATION. ON SLIDE TEN I DEMONSTRATE HOW WHEN THE UNIVERSITY HAS COST INCREASES ACROSS ALL FUNDING SOURCES. IT DOES FUNDING SOURCES DON'T INCREASE ONE FUNDING OURCE MUST INCREASE BY MORE IF ALL THE OTHERS THEN IF ALL THE SOURCES HAD A SMALL INCREASE. SO YOU'LL SEE HERE ON IN THIS CHART. THERE ARE VARIOUS COR FUNDS AND IF ALL OF THEM HAD A SMALL INCREASE THE STATE GENERAL FUND INCREASE WOULD BE LESS THAN IF ONLY THE STATE GENERAL FUND COMPONENT WAS BEING ASKED TO COVER ALL OF THE- INCREASE. FOR UP FOR THE COST INCREASES SO WHAT'S THE DOLLARS SO TO DO SO IF WE'VE WAITED ALL IT WOULD BE 12% INCREASE. OF INCREASED THE STATE FUNDS ONLY IS THAT WHAT THAT MEANS YES WELL IF SENT YES IF THE IF ONLY'S THE STATE FUNDS WERE COVERING ALL OF THE% ALL OF THE NEEDS OF THE UNIVERSITY AND WHAT'S THAT DO WE KNOW WHAT THE NUMBER IS WHAT WE'RE ASKING FOR FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY THREE MILLION PRICE COMING IS THAT WHY YOU'RE ASKING FOR THAT. I MEAN I'M JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'S WHAT'S THE TWELVE PLUS THAT IS NOT YOUR TOTAL ASK OR IS THAT I THINK THAT'S JUST AN ILLUSTRATIVE GRAPH THAT'S BEING THAT'S SHOWS THE DIFFERENTIAL BETWEEN THOSE THOSE PERCENTAGES IF ONE SOURCE HAVE TO COVER ALL OF IT VERSUS JUST LOW COMPONENT GIVEN THAT NOT ALL OF THE MARS EQUALLY SIZED 5% INCREASE TO OF NONRESIDENTS OPTIMAL TUITION IS LESS THAN A 5% INCREASE TO. OF TO STATE FUNDS OR TUITION BUT IN TERMS OF DOLLARS BUT WE YOU KNOW I'M NOT A MATH PERSON YOU'VE HAD TWO YEARS OF ME SO I'M SURE YOU FIGURE THAT OUT BUT IF NINETY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IS THE DELTA TO MAINTAIN EQUILIBRIUM BETWEEN YOU BETWEEN WHAT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED AND WHAT YOU NEED IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN. A FLAT LINE. IS NINETY FIVE MILLION WHAT IT WOULD TAKE TO AVOID A TUITION INCREASE. OR IS THERE SOMETHING MORE THAN THAT IS THAT A FAIR QUESTION WHAT WE ALSO WANT TO GROW OUR SERVICES SO WE HAVE A WE HAVE A SIXTY MILLION DOLLAR PROPOSAL TO HIRE NEW FACULTY. AND TO- BRIDGE GRADUATION GAPS SO WE AS A SYSTEM WANT TO NOT JUST MEET OUR BASIC COST INCREASES WE ALSO WANT TO. OF PROVIDE ENHANCED SERVICES TO OUR EXISTING STUDENTS. AND FOR WHAT OUR OPTIONS ARE. INCREASE DISCUSSION AROUND HERE IS NOT QUITE THE THIRD RAIL BUT IT GETS THERE AND I'M JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT IF MY COLLEAGUES DIDN'T WANT TO DEAL WITH A TUITION INCREASE WHAT'S WHAT'S THE OPTION THAT I SAY TO THEM YOU DON'T LIKE A TUITION INCREASE THEN WE NEED TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS TO HELP FUND YOU SEE HERE WE NEED NINETY FIVE POINT ONE MILLION DOLLARS TO HELP FUND YOU SEE TO AVOID A TUITION INCREASE AND THEN LET'S TALK ABOUT ALL THESE OTHER THINGS THAT YOU SEE WANTS TO DO WE WANT TO ADD FACULTY. YOUR WE WANTED INCREASING ENROLLMENT BY TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED STUDENTS YOU WANT TO DO THIS YOU WANT TO DO THAT EACH OF THOSE LITTLE BUCKETS HAS A PRICE TAG RIGHT AND YES LIKE GOING TO MAKE DONALD I CAN GET THE PICKLES THERE I CAN GET THE DOUBLE BURGER OR THE TRIPLE BOND OR WHATEVER AND BEACH BUST I THINK I UNDERSTAND YOU'RE QUITE SO IT WOULD THE NINETY FIVE MIL. DEL PLUS ABOUT THE MAIL. FOR TO IT. OF THE TO A AND- WE WOULD GET FOR YEAR. TO ADD MORE STUDENTS. SIXTY MILLION THAT THAT WOULD TAKE CARE OF DOUBLE K. TAKE CARE THE COST IF WE ARE PLANNING ON COVER HOPING TO COVER THAT WE NEED TO COVER- IF YOU'RE REQUESTING WE- I WAS TRYING TO UNDERSTAND MY OPTIONS. THEY'RE NOT MY OPTIONS BY THE WAY I. CHECKED WITH NUMBERS OUT OF THEIR DAY OUR EXPECTATION WOULD BE TO GET THAT SIXTY MILLION FROM ACCORD TUITION INCREASE- IN THAT FIRST YEAR. SO WHAT YOU DO AT THAT NUMBER. YOU KNOW AND WE NEED THE NINETY FIVE MILLION ON TOP OF THAT. SEWER OKAY OF. UP FULL OF MY MATH BOOK AND TRY TO GO TO WORK ON THAT. YEAH I DIDN'T MEAN TO INTERRUPT LOOKING AT WHAT BUT WE ARE WE'RE REQUESTING THE FULL TWO HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE MILLION WILL CONTINUE TO REQUEST THAT AND IN ADDITION THE GOVERNOR'S BY NINE UNDERSTAND YEAH. SO ON SLIDE ELEVEN- I DISCUSS A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE CORE HURT BASED TUITION MODEL AT NEW STUDENTS NEW STUDENTS WOULD SEE AN INCREASE OF THEIR FEES IN THE FIRST YEAR. AND THEN THOSE FROM PEACE WOULD REMAIN FLAT FOR UP TO SIX YEARS- BUT FOR THE POOREST STUDENTS ARE COVERT BASED TUITION MODEL. OFFERS AN INCREASE IN FINANCIAL AID. BECAUSE YOU SEE PUTS ASIDE ONE THIRD OF OUR TUITION REVENUES FINANCIAL AID FOR NEEDIEST CALIFORNIA STUDENTS- AND CAL GRANTS WHICH COVERED THE TUITION INCREASE COMPONENT SO THEY WOULD GET THE CAL GRANT PLUS SOME INSTITUTIONAL FINANCIAL AID. SO THEY WOULD ACTUALLY BE SLIGHTLY BTTER OFF THAN. IF THERE WAS NO TUITION INCREASE AT ALL. AND CURRENTLY OFF 57% OF OUR CALIFORNIA RESIDENT UNDERGRADUATES. DO NOT PAY ANY TUITION UP BECAUSE IT'S COVERED FOR THEM TO OUR FINANCIAL AID MECHANISM AND THEN TO SHIFT GEARS- FOR A LITTLE MOMENT. THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA FACULTY AND STUDENTS CONDUCT WORLD CLASS RESEARCH WE HAVE A TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR ONE TIME PROPOSAL. OF TO HELP CONNECT YOU SEE RESEARCH INNOVATION WITH THE CALIFORNIA ECONOMY WE DO THINK THAT THIS IS. IMPORTANT WE HAVE FIVE INNOVATIONS EVERY SINGLE DAY AS A SYSTEM AND IF WE CAN HELP GET THOSE INTO THE CALIFORNIA ECONOMY WE CAN CREATE SOME REAL GROSS AND REALLY- CONNECT OUR- OF FACULTY YET AND OUR STUDENTS WITH THE ECONOMY. IN TWENTY SIXTEEN WE RECEIVED TWENTY TWO MILLION. THAT WE WERE ABLE TO UTILIZE TO SUPPORT FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY SIX STARTUP COMPANIES WHICH COMBINED ATTRACTED TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY NINE MILLION DOLLARS AND PRIVATE INVESTOR. UP FUNDS INTO CALIFORNIA INTO THE START UPS AND WE'D LIKE TO CONTINUE THIS TRAJECTORY BY REQUESTING TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE NEXT YEAR TO CONTINUE THIS PROGRAM WHICH HAS SHOWN A TREMENDOUS RESULTS. AND THAT CONCLUDES MY PRESENTATION ON OUR OPERATING BUDGET I'D LIKE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU HAVE SIR. I DON'T KNOW THAT I HAVE ANY BUT I APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT YOU ALLOWED ME TO INTERRUPT YOU ALL OVER THE PLACE TO ASK HIM DURING YOUR TASTE. AND IT'S A COMMON LA WHO WANTS TO GO FOR. SO WE'LL JUST DO A HIGH LEVEL OVERVIEW OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. THE BIGGEST INVESTMENT WERE PROPOSING FOR THE UC IS THE 5% BASING CREASE WHICH WOULD TAKE THEIR MAIN GENERAL FUND APPROPRIATION. AND INCREASE IT BY A HUNDRED AND SIXTY NINE POINT TWO MILLION ON GOING. THAT WOULD COME WITH THE EXPECTATION THAT THE UC WOULD CONTINUE WORKING TO IMPROVE COLLEGE AFFORDABILITY TO IMPROVE ACCESS. TO ADDRESS ACHIEVEMENT GAPS AND TO DECREASE TIME 2 DEGREES WELL KNOWN ON ON THE TUITION PIECE THAT AT THIS TIME THE ADMINISTRATION DOESN'T BELIEVE A TUITION INCREASE WOULD BE WARRANTED GIVEN THE SUBSTANTIAL PROPOSAL AND GOVERNOR'S BUGET OF HUNDREDS SIXTY NINE AND A TOTAL OF TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY THREE. ON GOING. AT TWO SEVENTEEN ONGOING. AT AND LAST YEAR WE THE TWENTY NINETEEN BUDGET THE STATE INVESTED MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY EIGHT MILLION ONGOING GENERAL FUND. THOSE ARE BOTH HISTORICALLY SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS- PERMANENT FUNDING IN THE UC SYSTEM. AND SO- RAISING TUITION BE- IN ADVISABLE IN BED FOR STUDENTS AT THIS TIME. AND I UNDERSTAND BOTH THE POLITICS AND I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE FINANCE PIECE OF ALL THIS. DOES IS PROBABLY SOME SCIENCE TO THIS SIZE SOON AS OPPOSED TO JUST ARE IN TERMS OF. AN INCREASE IN COSTS. NO CARS COST MORE TODAY PIANOS COST MORE TODAY. LIFE COSTS MORE TODAY AND THERE'S AN INCREASE IN COST AND NOT BEING A MATH PERSON. THAT TRANSLATES INTO SOMETHING AT THE BOTTOM LINE AND- CAN YOU RESPOND TO THE TO THE DELTA ISSUE THE NINETY FIVE WHATEVER IT WAS NINETY FIVE POINT ONE OR WHATEVER THE NUMBER IS MILLION DOLLAR DELTA BETWEEN. WHERE THEY ARE AND WHERE YOU SEE CLAIMS TO NEED TO BE IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN SORT OF A FLAT LINE APPROACH TO WHAT TO THE DELIVERY OF THE SERVICES THAT YOU SEE PROVIDES. AND THEN MY PERHAPS IN ARTFUL QUESTIONS HAVING TO DO WITH THE TUITION INCREASE AND WHAT WOULD WE HAVE TO DO IN ORDER TO AVOID A TUITION INCREASE IF IN FACT THE INCREASES RESPONDING TO INCREASE COSTS DOES ANY THAT MAKES SENSE. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION SAY NO BUT THAT THAT MAY IT'S A 100% SENSE. I THINK IT. HI WHERE WE GET OUR PERSPECTIVE FROM SO FOR. THERE'S A COUPLE WAYS THAT WHEN WE CHARACTERIZE WHAT THE UC'S NEEDS ARE WE'RE NOT THINKING US THIS EARLY IN THE SAME TERMS THE UC ARE SO. FOR ONE- WHEN YOU LOOK AT ON PAGE FOR THE UC'S CORE FUNDS- THE STATE GENERAL FUND PORTION IS LISTED AS 42% AND THEN THERE'S THE ORANGE THAT INDICATES TUITION. BUT THE STATE FUNDS A SIGNIFICANT PERCENTAGE OF THAT- STUDENT TUITION PEACE THROUGH CAL GRANT AND SO THE STATE'S. CONTRIBUTION HERE TO OVERALL CORE FUNDING IS MORE THAN FIFTY PERCENT. AND SO. OUR STARTING POINT FOR THINKING ABOUT THE UC'S BUDGET IS TYPICALLY A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT. WE ALSO KNOW THIRD THERE'S NOT ALWAYS IN AGREEMENT ON WHAT THE MANDATORY COSTS ARE- AND THAT IN THIS PARTICULAR BUDGET. THE UC IS REQUESTING FORTY MILLION FOR INCREASED YOU SEE OUR P. PENSION PAYMENTS. BUT TWENTY MILLION OF THAT REFLECTS A RECENT DECISION MADE BY THE REGENTS TO- GO FOR MORE CONSERVATIVE ACTUARIAL. CALCULATIONS IN TERMS OF RETURN ON INVESTMENT. AND SO THE CONSERVATIVE NUMBER THAT THEY CHOSE AS AS- IS UNDER WHERE CAL STIRS IN CALPERS ARE AT IN TERMS OF WHAT THEY EXPECT TO RETURN TO BE WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS AFTER YEAH MARKET OF THE LESS YEAH COUPLE WEEKS. IT AND SO IT BUT IN THE LONG TERM THEY HAVE SET THEMSELVES UP TO. CREATE MORE NEED TO DUMP MONEY INTO COVER THAT OUTSTANDING PENSION LIABILITY AND SO IN TERMS OF THINKING ABOUT THAT AS A MANDATORY COST IT'S DEBATABLE AND OUR PERSPECTIVE WOULD BE THAT MAYBE TWENTY MILLION AS MORE LEGITIMATE THAN THETWENTY THAT REFLECTS A RECENT. DECISION THAT DOESN'T NECESSARILY ALIGN WITH WHERE THE STATE'S OTHER LARGE. PENSION COMMITMENTS ARE. AND I'VE I PLEDGE TO SIT DOWN WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE MUCH MORE THAN I AM INSIDE TO FIGURE OUT MY MATH BECAUSE I CAN'T DO IT IN PUBLIC BUT IT DOES SEEM TO ME THAT THE THAT THE DELTA WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS ABOUT NINETY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN THE SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS IS GOING TO COURT COVER SOME OTHER PROGRAMS I REALIZE YOU WANT SIXTY MORE BUT IT'S GOING TO COVER SOME OTHER PROGRAMS THE THREE THAT WERE LISTED SOMEWHERE IN HERE THAT I JUST. SPOTTED IN WILL HAVE TO HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT. WHETHER NINETY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS- OBVIATES THE NEED FOR OF. STUDENT TUITION INCREASE OTHER THAN THE FACT THAT YOU SEE HAS SOME. ADDITIONAL PROGRAMS THAT THEY WANT TO PUT FORWARD BUT I WOULD LIKE TO WORK WITH YOU ALL TO. IF YOU CAN. IF YOU CAN IMPROVE THE BRAIN WAVES OF US SEPTUAGENARIAN I'M GOING TO CHALLENGE YOU ON THAT POINT LA. SO YOU'VE HEARD A LOT OF DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES I DON'T WANT TO BELABOR THE POINT TOO MUCH ON WHAT MY BRAIN. BUT YOU KNOW THIS THIS ITEM REALLY HAS TO KEY. ISSUES THAT ARE PERENNIAL THE LEGISLATURE FACES AND EVERY YEAR THEY ARE ONE OF THE COST INCREASES YOU LIKE TO SUPPORT YOU SEE AND- HOW TO THOSE COVERED BE COVERED BETWEEN GENERAL FUND AUGMENTATIONS IN TUITION INCREASES. ON THE ADMINISTRATION THIS YEAR'S PROPOSING UP A SORT OF BASING CREASE THAT- IS UNRESTRICTED- IT IS GIVING YOU SEE THE FLEXIBILITY TO DECIDE WHAT COST INCREASE IS TO SUPPORT WITHIN THAT AUGMENTATION. AND IT IS ENTIRELY COVERING THAT FROM THE GENERAL FUND- AND- TUITION INCREASE SO THINKING ABOUT THESE TWO DIFFERENT ISSUES YOU DON'T THINK IN TERMS OF THINKING ABOUT WHAT COST INCREASES TO SUPPORT. WE DO HAVE CONCERNS WITH THE GOVERNOR'S FOR ALL APPROACH FIGHTING AN UNRESTRICTED BASED INCREASE. ON BECAUSE IT DOESN'T- ISN'T CONNECTED TO- AYE CALCULATIONS OF COST INCREASES IT DOESN'T IDENTIFY WHICH PRIORITIES IT'S SPECIFICALLY FUNDING IT GIVES A LEGISLATURE. AWESOME DIFFICULTY UNDERSTANDING WHAT EXACTLY IT'S BEING OUT TO SUPPORT IN THE BUDGET YEAR- BUT AS YOU. CAN BE DIFFICULT TO TRACK AGAINST THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL ON WHAT YOU SEE IS- PROPOSING SO WE RECOMMEND TYING INCREASES MORE SPECIFICALLY TO PRIORITIES THAT YOU HAVE A- BUDGET. WE ALSO NOTE AT THE NINETEEN TWENTY BUDGET TOOK THIS EXPECT ACTUALLY APPROACH THAT WE'RE- PUTTING IT HI. EVERY OUR PATIENTS SEVEN PRIORITIES PROVIDED CLEAR SAID WASN'T THE STATE'S EXPECTATIONS WERE REGARDING ITS AUGMENTATIONS. SO NOW THAT'S- EASY THING IS A MORE COUPLE QUESTION AS WELL. OKAY WE SHOULD IDENTIFY PRIORITIES BUT WHAT YOUR PRIORITIES BEING MUCH OF THAT AMOUNT BE THAT'S WHAT YOURS ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT RIGHT NOW. THERE WE THINK THERE ARE TWO WAYS TO THINK ABOUT IT THERE TO KIND OF CATEGORIES OF INCREASES THERE ARE. WHAT YOU MIGHT CALL BASIC OPERATIONAL INCREASES TO MAINTAIN EXISTING SERVICES AND TO BE. TOLERANT CREASES BENEFIT INCREASES OPERATING EXPENSES AND THEN YOU HAVE A SEPARATE CATEGORY OF INCREASES THAT WOULD BE MORE PROGRAMMATIC IN NATURE. THINGS LIKE EXPANDING MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES OR OTHER PROGRAMS THAT YOU UNIVERSITY ABOUT A FIGHT IN ITS- PRESENTATION. AND WE THINK YOU YOU WANT TO WEIGH BOTH OF THOSE AND YOU MAYBE WANNA START WITH OPERATIONAL COST INCREASES. THINK ABOUT WHICH OF THOSE COST YOU LIKE TO SUPPORT WHAT LEVEL AND THEN MOVE ON TO PROGRAMMATIC. IN TERMS OF THINKING ABOUT THIS SORT OF MANDATORY FOR THE UNIVERSITY. MORE COMPLICATED QUESTION THE UNIVERSITY HAS A LOTS OF FLEX. TO MANAGE COSTS ACROSS ITS BUDGET AND MANAGE IS IT SIMPLY BENEFIT PROGRAMS IT DETERMINES WHAT SALARIES OF LIKE TO PROVIDE. IT ISN'T ALWAYS THE MOST USEFUL OFF. ABOUT IT CAN BE MORE FOR JUST THINK ABOUT WHAT ARE THE COST INCREASES OF THESE PROGRAMS ABSENT A POLICY CHANGE. AND WHAT IS RIGHT AND WHAT. PURCELL BRING IS. WE JUST OF THE RIVERS ARE BASIC OPERATIONAL COST INCREASE SO WE ASSUME 3% SALARY INCREASES WE ASSUMED. COST INCREASES TO BENEFITS AND WE ASSUMED OPERATING EXPENSES IT INCREASES WE ALSO NOTED OUT SOME SAVINGS THE UNIVERSITY ANTICIPATES IT WILL ON HER. OFF FROM THINGS LIKE I'M GETTING HIGHER INVESTMENT INVESTMENT RETURNS FOR EXAMPLE. IMPROVE BURKE PROCUREMENT PRACTICES. AND WHAT WE ESTIMATED THAT BUDGET WHICH IS A LARGE TREE OF LEGISLATURE DOESN'T HAVE TO GO WITH THAT THEIR MANY OPTIONS FOR IT BUT THAT. THAT UNLESS YOU HAVE BUDGET COST ABOUT A HUNDRED EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS WHICH IS. A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT WHAT THE GOVERNOR IS. PROPOSING IN HIS BUDGET. SO THAT'S JUST OR THE FIRST SET OF ISSUES TO CONSIDER THE SECOND SET OF ISSUES IS NOW OKAY WE'VE DECIDED THE COST INCREASES. SHOULD BE THROUGH THE GENERAL FUND OR TUITION INCREASE. AND YOU'VE ACTUALLY HEARD A LOT OF THE FACTORS THAT YOU'D WANT TO WAY THERE. I'M WE THINK THEY'RE BASICALLY ARE THREE KEY FACTORS. THE FIRST WHICH THE ADMINISTRATION ALLUDED TO WAS THINKING ABOUT THE SHARE OF COSTS BETWEEN THE STATE AND STUDENTS- ABOUT HALF OF STILL HALF OF UNDERGRADUATE RESIDENT STUDENTS CURRENTLY- DON'T PAY TUITION THEY HAVE THAT COVERED THROUGH FINANCIALLY PROGRAMS. THE OTHER HALF FOR OUR MOST MOST OFTEN IS THE CASE THEIR FULL PAY STUDENTS SOME OF THEM GET UP. SOME AID THROUGH THE MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP BUT BY AND LARGE THERE- GENERALLY FULL PAY STUDENTS THEY'RE THEY'RE PAYING ABOUT HALF OF THEIR COSTS AND SO THE QUESTION BEFOREYOU IS. DISPATCHER SEEM REASONABLE AS A TO HIRE IS IT TOO LOW. THE SECOND FACTOR YOU COULD CONSIDER IS AFFORDABILITY. THIS SEEMS TO BE- ARE CONCERNED- THAT WE'VE HEARD FROM BOTH THE UNIVERSITY AND THE ADMINISTRATION- AS UNIVERSITY AND- ALLUDED TO- IT'S A BIT OF A COMPLICATED DISCUSSION BECAUSE WHEN YOU INCREASE TUITION. PROVIDES MORE AID FOR LIVING COSTS FOR FINANCIALLY NEEDY STUDENTS. SO TUITION INCREASE ACTUALLY HAS THE COUNTER TO WOULD HAVE EFFECTIVE IMPROVING AFFORDABILITY FOR FINANCIALLY NEEDY STUDENTS. IT INCREASED COSTS FOR STUDENTS WHO AREN'T ON FINANCIALLY RIGHT GETTING FULL TUITION. A COVERAGE SO. THERE'S A THERE'S A DIFFERENCE ON WHO'S PAYING FOR THAT TUITION INCREASE. AND THEN- WE ON THE THIRD POINT I'M SORRY HAD A- MENTAL- SITUATION THERE SO THAT'S THE THIRD POINT- IS TO THINK ABOUT. I'M YOU KNOW YOUR CAPACITY WHAT YOUR PRIOR IS ARE YOUR YOUR CAPACITOR FROM THOSE OF THE GENERAL FUND WHEN YOU ADOPTED TUITION INCREASE SAID IT PROVIDES FUNDING TO THE UNIVERSITY AT A POTENTIALLY LOWER COST TO THE GENERAL FUND. ALMOND SO THAT FREES UP MORE- CAPACITY TO FUND ADDITIONAL PRIORITIES YOU HAVE I JUST ILLUSTRATE THAT POINT IN THEIR IN OUR LIST OF THE BUDGET EXAMPLE A 3% TUITION INCREASE WOULD REDUCE GENERAL FUND COSTS OF. A TWO HUNDRED SEVENTEEN MILLION SO BELOW THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET BUT PROVIDE EFFECTIVELY MORE FUNDING TO THE UNIVERSITY TO COVER A LOT OF ITS OPERATING COSTS. I'M SO THOSE ARE JUST SOME FACTORS TO CONSIDER. AND THEN- A FINAL THING TO CONSIDER THAT SOMEWHERE DIFFERENT THIS YEAR'S UNIVERSITY IS CONSIDERING A LONG TERM POLICY- DID HAVE A GUY TUITION INCREASES IN THERE THE- OVERRIDING OBJECTIVE HERE SEEMS TO BE TO ENSURE STUDENTS HAVE MORE. PREDICTABILITY FOR THEIR TUITION INCREASES OTHERS A FIGURE AN AGENDA THAT SHOWS THAT IT'S BEEN IT GETS QUITE FALL TILE AND SOME YEARS IT'S FLAT NO THREE YEARS THEIR NOBLE HIKES. SO THEY'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS THIS BY HAVING A TUITION POLICY AND THEY'RE TWO DIFFERENT OPTIONS THERE CONSIDERING. ON WE THINK IT'S WORTHWHILE TO MAYBE REVIEW THOSE POLICY SEE IF THEY ALIGN WITH YOUR EXPECTATIONS. AND IF THOSE POLICIES ARE ADOPTED TO WAIT TO FACTOR THOSE ADDITIONAL REVENUES IN YOUR FINAL BUDGET DECISIONS. THANK YOU. YOU KNOW THAT'S WHAT I'M I'M GRAPPLING TRYING TO GRAPPLE WITH THIS AND I THINK WILL OBVIOUSLY CONTINUE TO DO THAT AND CERTAINLY I WILL. YOU KNOW WHERE THERE'S AN INCREASE IN COST MAKING SURE THAT THE STATE'S. APPROPRIATION IN THE BUDGET INCREASES THE- MEETS THE INCREASE IN COST TO THE BUT THE BASIC UP UNIVERSITY OPERATION. AND THEN WHEN THEY'RE ADDITIONAL PROGRAMS- EITHER THAT WE WANT TO SEE. PUT FORWARD OR THAT THE UNIVERSITY PROPOSES HOW THOSE PROGRAMS NEED TO BE PAID FOR AND SHOULD ALL OF THE ADDITIONAL COST OF A PARTICULAR PROGRAM BE COVERED OF THE GENERAL FUND BY THE STATE OR IS THERE SOME PROPORTIONATE SHARE THAT WE THINK YOU KNOW US STUDENTS THROUGH TUITION. SHOULD CONTRIBUTE TO THE PROGRAMS STUDENTS FOR EXAMPLE- COME FORWARD AND HAVE A VARIETY OF PROGRAMS THAT THEY WANT TO SEE- AT THEIR INSTITUTIONS AND YOU SEE IN GENERAL- AND THEN THE QUESTION IS WHO PAYS FOR THOSE BE PART OF THE STUDENT TUITION PACKAGE HOWEVER IT'S CONFIGURED WHETHER IT'S A COHORT PACKAGER. AN INFLATION ADJUSTED ON AN ANNUAL BASIS TUITION PACKAGE AND WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO FIGURE THAT OUT BUT IT WOULD BE YOU KNOW I'M TRYING TO GET OUT WHAT THE BASIC COST IS WHAT THE COST INCREASES GOV AND I UNDERSTAND YOUR POINT. SIR WHICH IS WE HAVE SOME DISAGREEMENTS AS TO WHAT'S INCLUDED IN THAT COST PACKAGE AND WHAT THOSE NUMBERS ARE. AND THEN WHO SHOULD BE PAYING FOR THAT WE'RE GOING TO. HOPEFULLY COME TO SOME AGREEMENT THERE AND THEN FIGURE THIS. THIS OUT ANY ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENTS MEMBER FOR I TURN TO MY COLLEAGUE. OF I THINK I WOULD JUST NOTE THAT WE- THE UNIVERSITY HAS MULTIPLE DIFFERENT FUNDING SOURCES WE HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF PHILANTHROPY COMING IN WE HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF ADDITIONAL NON RESIDENTS OF PROMOTE TUITION SO THERE ARE QUITE A FEW COST. THAT WE ARE NOW PLANNING FOR IN THE NEXT BUDGET YEAR BUT NOT ALL OF THEM ARE COMING FROM THE STATE SO EVEN THE FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS THAT I DRESSED EARLIER IS NOT ENTIRELY- IS NOT OUR FULL COST INCREASES FOR. US NEXT YEAR ARE WE HAVE WE HAVE A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF THESE MANDATORY COST INCREASES THAT INCLUDE STAFF SALARIES THAT INCLUDE. OF TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED UNFUNDED UNDERGRADUATES FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. BUT THERE'S A LOT OF. LOT OF DIFFERENT CATEGORIES AND WE WANT TO RETAIN FLEXIBILITY IN THE- THIS BUDGET INCREASE OF WE RECEIVED TO PROVIDE THE CHANCELLOR'S WITH THE ABILITY TO DIRECT THE FUNDS ON THEIR CAMPUS WHERE THEY NEED IT MOST OF WE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH YOU ABOUT DIRECTED INVESTMENTS INTO THINGS LIKE NEW INVOLVEMENT. OF AND OUR DEGREE COMPLETION PROGRAM DEFINITELY BUT FOR THOSE MANDATORY COST INCREASES WE LIKE TO RETAIN FLEXIBILITY FOR THE CHANCELLOR'S. RIGHT AND I'M JUST TRYING TO HAVE A FULL UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT OUR OPTIONS ARE. AND I ASSUME ALL OF THAT BACKGROUND INFORMATION ABOUT THE ADDITIONAL COST AND HOW THOSE ARE BEING COVERED. FINANCES PRIVY TO THAT SO. YES YES THEY ARE THEY'RE ALL IN THE REGION'S BUDGET WHICH IS OUR- AN ACCOUNTING DOCUMENT THAT I KNOW. YOU DON'T GIVE IT TO ME. BUT I THINK I. PROBABLY DID YES. IT'S IN THAT BIG BOOK THAT YOU RECEIVED THAT HAD THE TWO HUNDRED PAGE BOOK ON ON OUR- ZERO OF TRYING TO GO TO SCHOOL I MAY NEED OF FINANCIAL AID. YES WE HAVE A GOOD PROGRAM. MISTER CHAIR IF I MAY JUST TO PROVIDE A LITTLE BIT OF ADDITIONAL CONTEXT I AM PARTICULARLY REGARDING THAT THE DISCUSSION OF MANDATORY COSTS AND YOU KNOW SOME SOME OF WHICH ARE PERHAPS OPEN TO SOME INTERPRETATION OF HOW MANDATORY IS MANDATORY AND THINGS LIKE THAT- AS THE ONLY- MENTIONS LAST YEAR'S APPROACH IN THE BUDGET TOOK A LITTLE BIT OF A DIFFERENT APPROACH THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET OF DELINEATING MORE SPECIFICALLY. WHAT THE TARGETED- INVESTMENTS WE'RE GOING TOWARDS A LARGE COMPONENT OF THAT WAS ONE HUNDRED NINETEEN POINT EIGHT MILLION FOR SUSTAINING CURRENT OPERATIONS OR YOU KNOW KIND OF CORE OPERATIONS AND WHAT YOU SEE OFTEN TERMS MANDATORY COSTS I WOULD JUST NOTE THAT IN THIS YEAR'S GOVERNOR'S BUDGET APPROACH. AND ACTUALLY IN IN THIS YEAR'S. REQUEST FROM THE UC THE ITEMS THAT THEY'RE IDENTIFYING IS MANDATORY COST TO KIND OF SUSTAIN THEIR CORE OPERATIONS HAVE ADDITIONAL ELEMENTS THAT WERE NOT INCLUDED IN THAT LINE ITEM DELINEATION THE TWENTY NINETEEN BUDGET ACT SO THERE ARE A NUMBER OF ASPECTS IN MY COLLEAGUES SPOKE TO ABOUT HALF OF THE UC OUR P. REQUEST FROM. YOU SEE THAT'S A LITTLE BIT OF A DIFFERENT NUANCE APPROACH FROM LAST YEAR ALSO SOME FACULTY COMPENSATION SOME KIND OF MARGINAL COST OF ENROLLMENT DIFFERENCES THINGS LIKE THAT THAT- WERE. YOUR WERE NOT NECESSARILY INCLUDED IN. THE OPERATIONAL FUNDING PROVIDED TO YOU SEE WHEN IT WAS DELINEATED. MORE SPECIFICALLY LAST YEAR- AND THEN JUST TO ALSO NOTE AS AS THERE'S BEEN SOME MENTION OF. THE UC DOES HAVE CONSIDERABLE FLEXIBILITY AND KIND OF MADE MANAGING ITS COST. AND AS OUR COLLEAGUE WITH YOU SEE ALSO MENTIONED THAT THERE ARE ADDITIONAL REVENUE SOURCES AVAILABLE TO THE TO THE UC SO. WE WOULD JUST NOTE THAT IN RECENT YEARS. EVEN IN THE- WITH. SMALLER STATE INVESTMENTS THAN WERE INCLUDED IN THE TWENTY NINETEEN BUDGET ACT AND PROPOSED THE TWENTY TWENTY. GOVERNOR'S BUDGET UC HAS BEEN ABLE TO MAINTAIN TUITION FLAT. BELIEVE IT'S AND SEVEN OF THE PAST EIGHT YEARS. AS MY COLLEAGUE MENTIONED WE DO HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT WHETHER THIS TUITION INCREASES WARRANTED AND SEE IT AS KIND OF BAD FOR STUDENTS. TIME AT ALL AND WE ALSO THEN CAN HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT. THE ADDITIONAL PROGRAMS THAT ARE PROPOSED AND THEN I JUST ASSUME AND THEN OF THOSE ARE FUNDED AND WHETHER THOSE DESERVE. I GUESS THEY ALL DESERVE PROGRAMS BUT WHETHER WE CAN FIND SOME OF THOSE OUT OF THE GENERAL FUND OR WHETHER SOME OF THOSE. NEED TO BE SUPPORTED BY THE TUITION INCREASES. CORRECT AND THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET DOES MAKE INVESTMENTS IN SOME TARGETED AREAS IN ADDITION TO THE 5% GENERAL BASE INCREASE PROVIDED- AND IN ADDITION TO THAT. WE WOULD JUST KNOW THAT THIS YEAR'S APPROACH OF. THAT SENT FUND IS INCREASE PROVIDES YOU SEE CONSIDERABLE FLEXIBILITY SO THAT THEY CAN MAKE. SOME DETERMINATION OF. WHERE THAT SPENDING IS MOST AREN'T DEAD RIGHT. QUESTION EXCELLENT CONVERSATION A LOOK FORWARD TO THE MORE. NEXT ISSUE ALL RIGHT MOVING WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO START ON THIS ISSUE FOR RIGHT ISSUE FOR RESIDENT AND NONRESIDENT FROM. THAT'S RIGHT- SO WE'RE MOVING ON TO ENROLLMENT A UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA'S REQUESTING- THIRTY FIVE POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR ENROLLMENT OF WHICH THIRTEEN MILLION WOULD BE FOR THE BUDGET YEAR FOR TWENTY TWENTY ONE. AND TWENTY TWO POINT FIVE MILLION IS REQUESTED TO PRE FUND ENROLLMENT IN TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO SO YEAR. ONE YEAR OUT OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA STRIVES TO PROVIDE ACCESS TO TOP STUDENTS THROUGH HOLISTIC REVIEW OF APPLICATIONS ON A ROBUST FINANCIAL AID POLICY INTENDED TO ALLOW QUALIFIED STUDENTS TO ATTEND REGARDLESS OF INCOME. OCT CURRENTLY THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA HAS HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FIVE THOUSAND CALIFORNIA RESIDENT UNDERGRADUATES SO WE'RE PROVIDING A LOT OF OPPORTUNITY. SINCE TWENTY FIFTEEN YOU SEE HAS INCREASED UNDERGRADUATES PRESIDENT ENROLLMENT BY ALL OVER SEVENTEEN THOUSAND STUDENTS- THIS GROWTH IN UNDERGRADUATE RESIDENT STUDENTS HAS BEEN MADE POSSIBLE WITH STATE SUPPORT. OF BOTH FOR. EIGHT END OF FULLY FUNDING NEW ENROLLMENT AT UNIVERSITY ALLOWS FOR THE HIRING THE FACULTY AND FOR THE SUPPORT STUDENTS THAT SUPPORT SERVICES THAT THE STUDENTS NEED. AND THEN THERE WERE. BEEN DIRECTING YOUR ATTENTION TO OF SLIDE FOURTEEN. WE IN ROLE APPROXIMATELY SIXTY SEVEN THOUSAND NEW UNDERGRADUATES EVERY YEAR OF WHICH NINETEEN THOUSAND HAVE TRANSFERRED TO THE UNIVERSITY FROM A COMMUNITY COLLEGE. OF THIS YEAR YOU SEE RECEIVE TRANSFER APPLICATIONS FORM FROM MORE THAN- THIRTY SIX THOUSAND CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS THAT'S A FOUR POINT 6% INCREASE OVER THE LAST YEAR AND IT CONTINUES ARE YEAR TO YEAR GROWTH AND TRANSFER APPLICATIONS. BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY IT SHOWS A TREND AND HOW MUCH STUDENTS VALUES UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. WE'RE GROWING TRANSFER ENROLLMENT THROUGH OUR COMMITMENT TO ADMIT AT LEAST ONE TRANSFER STUDENT FOR EVERY TWO FRESHMEN THE WITH MATH. AND ALSO HERE TO TELL YOU I WAS IT DID I. READ MY ANALYSIS PROPERLY THAT FOR FALL TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN FRESHMAN MINUTES. TOTALING THESE STATISTICS SIXTY NINE POINT 8% OF THE FRESHMAN IT MEANT SO THE GPA THREE POINT EIGHT OR OVER. YES THAT SOUNDS CORRECT SIR- SOME OF OUR CAMPUSES NOW BASICALLY IF YOU DON'T HAVE A FOUR POINT OH IT'S AN BURKE INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT TO GET IN. TOO MUCH FOR THE MASTER PLAN. WE WANT MORE STUDENTS AND- IF WE ARE WE ARE EXPLORING ASSIST SYSTEM WE ARE EXPLORING DIFFERENT WAYS TO GROW OUR ENROLLMENT ONE OF THESE IS TO INCREASE THROUGHPUT OF STUDENTS TO GET THEM TO GRADUATE IN FOUR YEARS SO THAT THEY FREE UP THE SEAT AND THEN WE CAN GET AN ADDITIONAL STUDENT AND THERE WERE ALSO DOING PROGRAMS ON RECRUITMENT THAT ALL ISCUSS IN A BIT- AND WE ARE LOOKING AT OUR LONG TERM CAPITAL OUTLAY PLANS AND HOW WE CAN INCREASE. PHYSICAL CAPACITY OUR CAMPUSES AND OUR TEN AREN'T NINE UNDERGRADUATE CAMPUSES HAVE AT THIS POINT IDENTIFIED ABOUT TEN BILLION DOLLARS IN FUTURE PROJECTS OF WE'D LIKE TO UNDERTAKE TO CREATE MORE PHYSICAL- INSTRUCTIONAL CAPACITY ON OUR CAMPUSES SO WE DEFINITELY WANT TO WORK WITH THE STATE TO THINK ABOUT HOW DO WE ADMIT EVEN MORE CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS STUDENTS. OF THE MASTER PLAN OF ONCE THE UNIVERSITY TO A- ADMIT FROM THE TOP TWELVE POINT FIVE. THERE MAY BE A LOT OF ROOM FOR CONVERSATION OF IS THAT THE CORRECT NUMBER WE GET SO MANY QUALIFIED APPLICATIONS. OF THAT BEHALF. IF IVEN THE APPROPRIATE AMOUNT OF FUNDING FOR THOSE NEW STUDENTS WE'D LOVE TO EXPAND. I CERTAINLY KNOW CRITICISM I JUST I MEAN I GUESS IT'S OF. NO ON ONCE IN ONE SENSE IT'S A GOOD PROBLEM TO HAVE IN THE OTHER SENSE IT'S A PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE TO SOLVE. OF WHERE WE ARE FINDING THAT MORE MORE CALIFORNIA HIGH SCHOOLERS ARE BECOMING A THROUGH G. PREPARED WHICH IS A GREAT THING THERE ARE PREPARED FOR TRANSFER TO A FOUR YEAR INSTITUTION BUT- THAT THAT DEMAND HAS DEFINITELY STARK APOSTASY AND IN ORDER TO CONTINUE TO INSTRUCT THEM WE NEED- WE NEED A LOT OF MONEY TO HIRE INSTRUCTORS. SO MOVING ON TO SLIDE FIFTEEN AND THIS ACTUALLY TOUCHES ON SOME OF THESE PROBLEMS IF YOU SEE MAKES ENROLLMENT DECISIONS IN EARLY MARCH SO WE'VE NOW SENT OUT LETTERS. TO HIGH SCHOOLERS SAYING THAT THEY WILL BE ADMITTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF WHAT THIS IS WELL BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE MAKES A DECISION ON HE ENROLLMENT LEVEL THAT YOU WOULD LIKE US TO HAVE. FOR THE NEXT YEAR SO WE'RE WE'RE AHEAD OF THESE DECISIONS AND THAT MAKES IT REALLY DIFFICULT FOR THE CAMPUSES TO ENROLL THE NUMBER STUDENTS THAT THE LEGISLATURE WANTS US TO SUPPORT. AND SLIDE. ABOUT FIFTEEN SHOWS THE NUMBER OF UNFUNDED STUDENTS THAT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SYSTEM AS AND ROLLED SINCE TWENTY FIFTEEN WHICH WE ARE VERY HAPPY THAT WE HAD THIS BIG SURGING CALIFORNIA RESIDENT UNDERGRADUATE ENROLLMENT- BUT OVER FIVE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED OF THOSE STUDENTS. BOB HAD NO MARGINAL COST OF INSTRUCTION COMING FROM THE STATE SO THAT PLACES OF A HUGE BURDEN ON THE CAMPUSES BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE THE MONEY TO HIRE THE INSTRUCTORS FOR THEM SO THAT MEANS WE HAVE TO HAVE OTHER MANAGEMENT TOOLS. AND ALSO WE'RE SEEING SOME EARLY INDICATORS THAT OCT QUALITY STUDENTS ARE LESS HAPPY WITH THE QUALITY WE'RE SEEING MORE STUDENTS RESPONDING THAT THEY IF THEY KNEW WHAT THEY KNEW NO NOW THEY MIGHT NOT A ROLL OF THE UC. AND WE'VE HAD 13% OF OUR STUDENTS A REPORT THAT THEY WERE UNABLE TO GET INTO THE MAJOR OF THEIR FIRST CHOICE THAT'S A LARGE NUMBER AND THAT'S UP FROM ABOUT 3% BACK IN A TWO THOUSAND THREE. YEAH THIS THIS UNFUNDED. ENROLLMENT GROWTH IS THAT THAT'S A FUNCTION I GATHER OF OUR BUDGET PROCESS OF WE BELIEVE SO WE- RECEIVE SIGNALS FROM THE LEGISLATURE FOR TWO OF THOSE YEARS WE WERE TOLD THAT WE HAD TO- IN ROLE AT LEAST. FIVE THOUSAND STUDENTS AND AT LEAST TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED STUDENTS. AND BECAUSE OR WE WOULD NOT RECEIVE ANY MONEY FOR ANY OF THOSE STUDENTS. AND BECAUSE WE WERE UNDER THAT PRESSURE WE WENT AND WE OF MADE MORE OFFERS. THEN REALLY WE GAPS NEEDED TO US AND WE- OVER AND ROLLED. OF AND THEN. OF WE WERE FACING SOME SOME PRESSURE ON THE AMOUNT OF STUDENTS WHO WANT TO COME INTO THE SYSTEM AND THE WAY THOSE OFFERS ARE BEING MADE DOESN'T DOESN'T MATCH THE US STATE PROCESS I THINK THE STATE PROCESS IS PROBABLY. A SIGNIFICANT COMPONENT OF IT MAYBE 80% YOU KNOW WHEN YOU GIVE US AN INDICATOR THAT YOU WANT US TO AND ROLL NEW STUDENTS OR THE REGION'S TELL US TO GO FORTH AND ENROLL STUDENTS BECAUSE THEY WANT TO GROW CAPACITY THE CAMPUS IS THAN COMPLY WITH THAT REGION TOLL REQUEST BUT THEN THE LEGISLATURE PERHAPS DOESN'T GIVE US THE- AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT WE THOUGHT WE WANTED BUT I MEAN IF IT'S OUR- ISSUE. IT SHOULD BE. THE FIVE OR SIX OR SEVEN YEAR PROBLEMS THAT SHOULD GO AWAY IF WE UNLESS WE JUST CONTINUALLY PERPETUATED PROBLEM ME. WHAT IS A MAIN YOU ENROLL A CLASS AND- YOU MAY NOT BE FUNDED FOR THE FIRST YEAR AND YOU TAKE IN TWO THOUSAND MORE BUT I ASSUME THEN YOU'RE NOT FUNDED FOR THE SECOND YEAR THE THIRD YEAR THE FOURTH YEAR THE FIFTH I MEAN. DON'T WE FIX THIS AT SOME POINT OR WE JUST ASSUME. WE HAVE NOT BEEN FIXING IT- THAT'S THE WAY IT USED TO WORK BACK IN LIKE TWO THOUSAND. WHERE ONCE WE HAD AND ROLLED. THE LEGISLATURE WOULD LOOK THE NEXT YEAR AND SAY HOW MUCH DID YOU GO OVER THE AMOUNT AND THEN THEY WOULD JUST SIR TOP THE UNIVERSITY OFF. THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN ANYMORE- BUT THE METHOD OF PRE FUNDING WOULD HELP US. GET TO A- GET TO A SOLUTION ON THAT TO A GOOD LONG WAY. WHERE YOU WOULD GIVE US THE MONEY NOW AND INDICATE NOW HOW MANY STUDENTS YOU WANT US TO AND ROLE. FOR FALL TWENTY TWENTY ONE. AND THEN AND WE'RE REQUESTING TWENTY TWO POINT FIVE MILLION FOR THAT AND THEN AS WE'RE MAKING IN ROMAN DECISIONS AND RECRUITMENT AND PLANNING ALL THROUGH THE YEAR WE CAN HIRE THE FACULTY AND THAT HAVE THE CLASS START. I THINK MY COLLEAGUES OVER HERE WANT TO JUMP IN. DID SOMEONE ADDRESS I MEAN WHY DON'T WE TOP IT OFF IF WE SAY IF IT'S US AND WE SAY. THE LACSON YEAH I THINK THIS GOES BACK TO ITS ON THE WERE TALKING WHEN THE LAST ITEM IS JUST HELPFUL PERSPECTIVE HERE THAT. THAT ERA FROM TWENTY FIFTEEN TO TWENTY NINETEEN SEVERAL YEARS IN A ROW THE SAME APPROACH THAT WE'RE PROPOSING WITH THIS GOVERNOR'S BUDGET WAS TAKEN. WERE A FLEXIBLE BASED AUGMENTATION. ON THE GENERAL FUND APPROPRIATION WAS OFFERED BY THE STATE. AND SO THAT MEANT THAT A LARGE COMPONENT OF WHAT THE STATE WAS PROVIDING YOU SEE. DURING SEVERAL THOSE YEARS WAS A FLEXIBLE INCREASED TO THEIR- AT. THE CAMPUS LEVEL APPROPRIATIONS SO AND SO THE USE THAT SO THAT YOU CAN HAVE A DIFFERENT INTERPRETATION OVER. DID THE STATE FUNDED THE STUDENTS ARE NOT ONE PERSPECTIVE WOULD BE THAT THE STATE PROVIDED A- A SEVERAL PERCENT BASE AUGMENTATION THAT THE UC COULD USE. A HOWEVER THEY SAW FIT TO ADDRESS COST PRESSURES. AND TO EXPAND ENROLLMENT. OR YOU CAN CALL OUT A MARGINAL COST AS THE UC IS SAYING AND- SO FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE IT'S IT GOES BACK TO THERE'S DIFFERENT WAYS OF INTERPRETING THIS YEAR. END OF THE DISCUSSION IS I SEEM TO REMEMBER. ACT ME IF I'M WRONG ABOUT WHETHER WE ACTUALLY FUND YOU SEE ON A PER STUDENT BASIS. OR NOT THE WE HAVE THAT CONVERSATION. YOU'RE LOOKING AT ME MAYBE I'M MAYBE I HAD A DREAM AND IT WAS A NO THAT'S DEFINITELY A CONVERSATION THAT HAS BEEN HAD IN THE PAST AND IS CONTINUE TO HAPPEN SO. WE RECOGNIZE THAT OKAY SIR. YEAH I THINK YOU'RE RAISING AN IMPORTANT- ISSUE WITH HAVING THE SORT OF UNRESTRICTED BASE INCREASES AND A NOT HAVING- FUNDING THAT'S ALWAYS TIED ON A PER STUDENT BASIS THAT CREATES CONFUSION ABOUT WHAT EXACTLY THE STATE HAS FUNDED. ALMOND MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO SORT OF EVALUATE- STATEMENTS ABOUT WHAT IS AND ISN'T FUNDED AT THE UNIVERSITY IS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY WE HEARD THE LEGISLATURE TO IDENTIFY COST HIGH FUNDING THOSE COSTS. WE% THINK IT'S PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT WITH ENROLLMENT GROWTH- THIS PROPOSED BUDGET DOESN'T SAID IN A MOMENT TARGET. OF THE ADMINISTRATION HAS SENT OUT SIGNALS IT WOULD LIKE YOU SEE TWO GROWN ROMAN BUT IT DOESN'T HAVE A PROPOSED TARGET OR I DON'T OR HI SPECIFIC FUNDING FOR THAT PURPOSE- AND WE THINK THAT SENDS A CONFUSING SIGNAL TO THE UNIVERSITY AND- COULD SET UP NEXT. WEEK I GET CONFUSED EXPECTATIONS ABOUT WHAT THE STATE'S ACTUALLY TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH WE THINK ABOUT OUR APPROACH IN HIS APPROACH THE STATE'S TAKEN IN PREVIOUS YEARS THIS IS TO LIVE BY. THE SUDDEN AND ROMAN TARGET IN THE BUDGET THE STATEMENT SETTING THAT TARGET ONE YEAR AFTER THE BUDGET YOU'RE SO IN IN IN FOR. INSTEAD OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE WOULD SET THE TARGET FOR TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. AND THEIR PURPOSE BEHIND THAT IS- THAT YOU SEE ADMISSIONS PROP- DECISIONS OFTEN HAPPEN SOMEONE BEFORE BUDGET DECISIONS ARE FINALIZED. FOR YOU SEE THIS YEAR WILL MAKE- FALL MOMENT ADMISSION DECISION SOMETIME IN THE SPRING BEFORE THE BUDGETS NOW ACTED IN JUNE SO IF YOU SAID IN ROMAN TARGET FOR THE BUDGET YEAR YOU SEE WILL OF A READY MADE FALLEN NATION DECISIONS WILL BE TOO LATE TO. SEND A SIGNAL THAT'S WHY THE STATE'S BEEN SET IT UP TARGET ONE YEAR LATER. ALL WE SHOULDN'T HAVE THESE. UNFUNDED GROWTH ISSUES ON A GO FORWARD BASIS YOU KNOW THAT I THINK PART OF THE CHALLENGES THAT- WHEN THE STATE SET THESE TARGETS. AT A SAYS THE UNIVERSITY NOTED IT DIDN'T SET- IT JUST SORT OF SAID THIS IS THE LEVEL THAT WE THAT YOU SHOULD BE ON GROWING- AND IT DIDN'T- IT ON IN PASS BUDGETS WERE WAS OFTEN THE CASE IS THAT THE STATE SET OF MARGIN OF ERROR. FOR RECOGNIZING THAT ENROLLMENT MAY AS PART OF PART IN ART PARTLY SCIENCE. AND SO IS OFTEN LIKE THEY THERE'S A THEY ADMIT. THAT WORK IN A VERY- PORTION OF THE FUND IN MIGHTGO A SOCIO. BUT NOT ALL THE- WOULD DISAPPEAR. SO GET A GAVE THE UNIVERSE. SOME TO SIR OF MAKE THAT AND- SETS IN A PRO. THE STATE COULD TAKE A IT WAS CAN. ABOUT THIS TREND. I THINK ANOTHER AREA OF UNCERTAINTY IS THE STATE'S. USED TO SET UP A BASEMENT BASIN ROMAN TARGETS SO USED TO SAY YOU'RE FUNDED FOR TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY THOUSAND STUDENTS ARE HOW MANY STUDENTS IT'S SET. IN RECENT YEARS IT HAS BEEN SETTING A GROWTH TARGET WITHOUT SPECIFYING WHAT THAT BASELINE IS UNIVERSITIES BEEN TRYING TO MAKE AN EFFORT TO- WORK WITH THE STATE ON THAT SO THEY'VE BEEN. THEY'VE BEEN ADMITTING MORE ENROLLING OR STUDENTS AND USING THAT AS A NEW BASELINE REGARDLESS IF THERE IF THEY INVOLVE MORE THAN. WHAT WAS ACTUALLY SPECTER BY THE STATE SO THAT'S ANOTHER VERY RICH CREATED SOME CONFUSION SO THERE ARE WAYS THE STATE COULD. ON SET A TARGET THAT GIVES THE UNIVERSITY A LITTLE BIT MORE FLEXIBILITY. ON IN A LITTLE MORE CLARITY ABOUT WHAT IT'S EXPECTING. I MEAN I UNDERSTAND THE I THINK I UNDERSTAND THE DIFFERENCE IN THE BUDGET YEARS AND WE- YOU KNOW IF IT'S THIS YEAR. THEY CAN'T. THEY CAN'T DO IT BECAUSE THEY WERE ALREADY ADMITTED. SO WE SET NEXT YEAR A TARGET. BUT VIEW SEE KNOWS WHAT THEIR COST OF EDUCATION IS ELEVEN OR TWELVE THOUSAND DOLLARS A STUDENT OR WHATEVER IT IS AND IF WE WANTED TO GROW BY TWO THOUSAND WE COULD RUN THE MATH ON THAT AND SAY HERE'S- X. AMOUNT OF MONEY FOR. THE GROWTH THAT WE EXPECT YOU TO ATTAIN AS AN INSTITUTION RIGHT. AND THEN GIVEN THE CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUES BETWEEN YOU SEE AND ALL THE REST OF US THEY COULD CHOOSE TO SPEND THAT ARE NOT SPENT AND I SUPPOSE. AND THEN COME IN WITH AN UNFUNDED GROSS NUMBER BUT WE WOULD WE WOULD HAVE SAID WE EXPECT YOU TO GROW BY TWO THOUSAND STUDENTS YOU TELL US YOUR COST OF EDUCATION IS THAT SEX YOU COST OF EDUCATION IS WHY. HERE'S A CHECK FOR THE COST TO FUND THE GROWTH ELEMENT THAT WE'VE PROGRAMMED INTO OUR BUDGET IN THE TWENTY. TWENTY ONE. TWENTY TWO BUDGET YEAH WHAT WE WAS SO WE DO HAVE A PER STUDENT FUNDING RATE THAT WE PROVIDE THEM FOR A MOMENT GROWTH SO WE DO HAVE A BASIS TO. DETERMINE HOW MUCH FUNDING TO PROVIDE FOR ENROLLMENT GROWTH. I THINK THE ISSUE HERE IS THERE'S- SOME UNCERTAINTY ABOUT WHAT THE BASELINE TO GROW ABOUT IS WHEN THEY WHEN THEY ENROLL MORE STUDENTS THAN EXPECTED- WHEN YOU PROVIDE THEM FUNDING THE NEXT YEAR IS THAT IS THAT TO PAY DOWN THAT UNFUNDED STUDENTS OR DO YOU AND- DO YOU EXPECT THEM TO INCORPORATE THE STUDENTS INTO THE NEW BASS FINDING GROW OFF OF THAT. I THINK THAT'S WHERE- THERE'S THERE COULD BE SOME UNCERTAINTY THERE. BUT WE DO HAVE A PERSON FUNDING- RATE THAT WE PROVIDE THE UNIVERSITY THAT OUT THAT DOES OFFER A RATIONALE TO PROVIDE FUNDING BASED ON LOAN GROWTH WE SHOULD BE A FIX THAT PROBLEM RIGHT. THE ONE YOU IDENTIFIES IT IT'S YOU HAVE OPTIONS TO ADDRESS IT IF YOU'RE INTERESTED IN THAT. UPBEAT COUPLE OF COMMON SIR. OF MILLION MISSED THE POINT. NO NO NO YOU AYE. WE HAVE A MARGINAL COST OF INSTRUCTION RATE THAT HAS BEEN NEGOTIATED WITH. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND THE LEGISLATURE IN. LA THAT WE AGREE WITH THAT'S THE COST PER STUDENT THAT WE OFTEN USE. HOW MUCH DOES IT COST THE UNIVERSITY TO EDUCATE SINGLE STUDENT- WHEN WE DO. AT THESE UNFUNDED. STUDENTS INTO OUR BASE IT ERODES THAT DOLLAR PER STUDENT. AS A HOLD THAT THE UNIVERSITY HAS TO SPEND. AND IT REALLY MEANS THAT WE'RE SERVING NOREEN THIS PROBLEM. OF NOT HAVING THE FLATTERING FACULTY. THAT WE NEED TO- PROVIDE THEM WITH INSTRUCTION WE'RE JUST TRYING TO STUFF THE STUDENTS INTO THE- INTO THE CLASSROOMS. BUT THE IMPORTANT POINT I WANT TO MAKE IS THAT WHEN THE UNIVERSITY HAS. OF INFLATIONARY COST INCREASES. WITH IN A REASONABLE. MARGIN OF. TWO POINT FIVE TO TWO POINT 8% ACROSS ALL OUR CAMPUS FUNDS ACROSS ALL THOSE CORE FUNDS. AND WE GET GIVEN A 2% STATE GENERAL FUND INCREASES HAPPENED. TWO OR 3% AS HAPPENED UNDER GOVERNOR BROWN. SKIN AND THEN AT THE SAME TIME GOT TOLD NOT TO INCREASE TUITION. OF AND THEN EXPECTED. TO INK IF WE GET THEN GET TOLD THAT WE HAVE THE- OPTION TO INCREASE ENROLLMENT THAT'S NOT A REAL. OPTION WE NEED THOSE INFLATIONARY COST INCREASES. IN KEEPING IT. AT A MODEST INFLATIONARY INCREASE IS JUST REALISTIC FOR WHAT IT COSTS TO DO BUSINESS. FOR OUR CAMPUSES BUT WHERE'S MY QUESTIONS ABOUT THE DELTA BETWEEN WHATEVER IN. THE DELTA OF NINETY FIVE WHATEVER HIS POINT ONE MILLION DOLLARS IN. DOES THAT MAINTAIN THE FLAT LINE AND THEN ARE WE TALKING ABOUT THESE OTHER PROGRAMS AND HOW MUCH THEY COST AND WHO'S GOING TO PAY FOR THEM AND IS IT OUT OF THE GENERAL FUND OR OUT OF TUITION. AND IF THERE'S SOME DISAGREEMENT OVER WHAT THE- COST OF OPERATION IS TO MAINTAIN THE STATUS QUO THEN WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO RESOLVE THAT AND THEN HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT. DISCIPLINE SHOULD THIS BE PAID FOR BY STUDENTS THROUGH STUDENT TUITION. SHOULD THIS BE PAID FOR BY THE JEWS BY THE GENERAL FUND THESE ADDED PROGRAMS SO. WE PROBABLY CAN FIGURE THIS OUT I WOULD PROBABLY. SOMETIMES TALKING AT CROSS PURPOSES I THINK I THINK WE'RE VERY CLOSE TO FIGURING IT OUT- TO GET TO THAT INFLATIONARY COST WE NEED THAT NINETY FIVE MILLION. OR ARE PLANNED FOR THE TUITION DOLLARS IS IF. IS TO HOPEFULLY USE IT FOR ENHANCED SERVICES UP AND HIRING FACULTY AND WE DO HAVE THESE FIVE THOUSAND UNFUNDED STUDENTS WHO. WOULD LOVE TO GET MORE FACULTY TORQUE CAMPUSES TO INSTRUCT THEM PERFECT. OKAY I DIDN'T MEET SO PLEASE PROCEED I'VE ALL NIGHTER UP DID YOU A FEW TIMES TO THAT'S ALL RIGHT I HAVE SOME SLIDES THAT I'M GOING TO GO THROUGH VERY QUICKLY JUST FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES I SLIDE SIXTEEN HERE. OF TO SHOW WHO ARE STUDENTS AND HOW IS THE ETHNIC COMPOSITION OF OUR STUDENT BODY GROWING- AND- AS SOME NOTEWORTHY ITEMS ARE THAT OVER THE LAST TWENTY YEARS. OF ARE UNDER REPRESENTED GROUPS STUDENT BODY HAS GROWN FROM EIGHTEEN POINT FIVE PERCENT. TO THIRTY ALMOST 35% OF AND WHAT THAT REALLY REPRESENTS IS. IN HEAD COUNT IS ALMOST A THREE TIMES. THE GROWTH IN STUDENTS BECAUSE WE'VE GROWN SO MUCH OUR OVERALL STUDENT BODY- SO THE PERCENTAGE DOESN'T GO UP THREE TIMES BUT THE HEAD COUNT DOES. AND WE ARE STILL. CONTINUING TO LOOK AT FACULTY DIVERSE. CRUDE PERTAINS ARE HIGHLY QUALIFIED OF THE U. R. G. OF FACULTY INTO OUR SYSTEM SO THAT OUR FACULTY START TO REFLECT OUR STUDENT BODY AND STUDENTS FEEL. THAT THEY'RE BEING OBSTRUCTED BY- A VERY DIVERSE. OF FACULTY. AND THAT CONCLUDES THE ENROLLMENT DISCUSSION DO YOU HAVE ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS DO YOU WANT ME TO JUST MOVED TO. THE NEXT ISSUE WELL HERE'S A QUESTION ON LC OF LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA PLUS. HIGH SCHOOL PROGRAMMER ARE YOU PREPARED TO. MAYBE YOU ALREADY ADDRESS THAT BUT MY QUESTION WAS IS THAT WORKING. UP IT IS IT IS WORKING- SO WE'D LIKE TO THANK THE LEGISLATURE FOR GIVING US AN ADDITIONAL SIX MILLION DOLLARS IN THE CURRENT YEAR. THAT HAS BEEN DISTRIBUTED TO OUR CAMPUSES BUT I DON'T AT THIS POINT HAVE THE HOME A RATE OF HOW MUCH HAS BEEN EXPENDED IN THE CURRENT YEAR. BUT FROM THE PRIOR OF. APPROPRIATIONS THAT THE LEGISLATURE PROVIDED TO US WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT CAMPUSES THAT WERE USING LC A FIVE- PLUS FUNDING FOR. ART RETENTION EFFORTS SAW BIG JUMPS IN THE RETENTION OF THOSE STUDENTS AND THEIR SUCCESS RATE. OF THAT WERE RECEIVING INDIVIDUAL ATTENTION UNDER THOSE PROGRAMS AND WE ALSO SAW INCREASES IN APPLICATIONS FROM THOSE CAMP FROM THOSE HIGH SCHOOLS WHERE THE LCF COORDINATORS WERE WORKING WITH THE- OF WITH THE HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO RECRUIT STUDENTS. YOU KNOW I WAS JUST LOOKING IN OUR ANALYSIS HERE IN. YOU KNOW I'M OBVIOUSLY I MIGHT NOT HAVE THE CONTEXT BUT REPORT NOTED MISSION RATE FOR ALL SEE IT SEE IF OF PLUS STUDENTS INCREASE FROM FIFTY FOUR PERCENT. IN TO NOT ADMISSIONS RATES OF NON LC IF OF POST STUDENTS WHICH ALSO GREW FROM 61% 64% SO GROWTH IN BOTH CATEGORIES. OF I DON'T HAVE THOSE PERCENTAGES IN FRONT OF ME BUT- WE DO BELIEVE THAT THE PROGRAMS ARE SUCCESSFUL IN LETTING STUDENTS WHO WOULDN'T OTHERWISE CONSIDER APPLYING TO UC KNOW ABOUT THEIR OPTIONS NO ABOUT WHAT OUR REQUIREMENTS THEY HAVE TO MEET IN ORDER TO GET INTO A FOUR YEAR INSTITUTION AND OF SUCCESSFULLY NAVIGATE THEM THROUGH THE APPLICATION PROCESS AND ALSO ONCE THEY ARE YOU SEE. THE INDIVIDUAL ACADEMIC COUNSELING SERVICES THAT THEY RECEIVE WE HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO INCREASE RETENTION RATES QUITE A BIT. OKAY WELL WE CAN TALK OFF LINE ABOUT THAT I HAVEN'T SEEN THE SPECIFIC REPORT THAT WAS SUBMITTED NOR WHAT I NORMALLY SEE THAT BUT WE CAN TALK ABOUT THAT I'LL TAKE A LOOK AT THE I'LL MAKE CERTAIN YOU AND YOUR STAFF GET A COPY OF. DID TO MY STAFF OKAY THANK YOU. FINANCE MISTER CHAIR I HAD ONE CLEAR FINE POINT ON. TO CLOSE THE ENROLLMENT DISCUSSION. AT SO BECAUSE WE HAD TALKED ABOUT THE PREVIOUS. BUDGETS ENROLLMENT WHICH WE FROM OUR VIEW IS A MORE OF AN OPERATIONS COST. ISSUE BUT TO SPECIFICALLY SPEAK TO THIS BUDGET YEAR. WE WOULD NOTE THAT. THAT THE TWENTY NINETEEN BUDGET ACT FUNDED. FOR FIVE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED AND SIXTY. NEW SLOTS. THERE WAS SPREAD OVER TWO ACADEMIC YEARS AND THAT INCLUDED THE ACADEMIC YEAR TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE. SO ESSENTIALLY WE ARE DOING CATCH UP. OR TOP OFF FOR WHATEVER THE SENATE BUT ESSENTIALLY THE TWENTY. TWENTY ONE- BUDGET ALREADY HAS PRE BAKED SIXTEEN HUNDRED NEW SLOTS THAT YOU SEE INTO SPACE AND ROLLING THIS UPCOMING YEAR. SO FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE ON ENROLLMENT THAT'S A CRITICAL. THAT'S CRITICAL TO NOTE AND WE DO ACKNOWLEDGE- WE APPRECIATE THIS COMMITTEES CAREFUL ATTENTION TO OF THE ISSUE IN THE OVERALL CONVERSATION THAT IT'LL BE AN ON GOING ONE. WHY% APPRECIATE YOU GIVING ME ON THE CENTER LINE THANK YOU. I ALWAYS NEED HEALTH THOUGHTFUL ANALYSIS OKAY LET'S GO TO THE NEXT TO ISSUE WHICH IS ISSUE NUMBER FIVE. A DEGREE ATTAINMENT AND COMPLETION AN EXTENSION PROGRAM RIGHT YES CORRECT- THANK YOU SIR. SO THIS IS THE PROGRAMMATIC AREA IN WHICH YOU SEE WOULD LIKE TO DO- IMPROVEMENTS AND PROGRAM EXPANSIONS WITH IN THE UNIVERSITY- WE HAVE A UC TWENTY THIRTY PROGRAM. THAT IS INTENDED TO PRODUCE MORE DEGREES FOR CALIFORNIA IT HAS THREE GOALS WE WANT TO PRODUCE TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND MORE DEGREES. OF THEN WE ARE ALREADY- SCHEDULED TO PRODUCE SO THIS WOULD BE A TOTAL OF ONE POINT TWO MILLION. OF GRADUATES OF UC BY TWENTY THIRTY BETWEEN BETWEEN TWENTY TWENTY AND TWENTY THIRTY- WE ALSO WANT TO INCREASE IMPORTANTLY OUR GRADUATION RATE 290% FOR ALL STUDENT GROUPS. SO CURRENTLY WHILE WE HAVE A HIGH GRADUATION RATE FOR OUR NON PAL CAUCASIAN STUDENTS OF. THE WHOLE STUDENT FIRST GENERATION AND YOU ARE G. STUDENTS ARE GRADUATING AT A SLOWER RATE. BUT WHAT THIS WOULD LEAVE ME FOR THE INDIVIDUAL STUDENT BECAUSE CAL GRANT NOW TO FOR YOUR- I YOU SEE PRICES IN FIND AID INSTITUTIONAL NATIONAL FOR THE FIFTY YEAR. BUT STUDENTS ARE RECEIVING LESS A AT THE STATE AND SO THE INDIVIDUAL DEBT LOAD OF STUDENTS WHO STATE FIVE FOUR SIX YEARS IT'S HIGHER. THOSE WHO GRADUATED FOUR YEARS THEY ALSO MISS GOING TO THE WORK FORCE TWO YEARS SOONER. AND THEIR LIFETIME EARNINGS ARE ACTUALLY LESS THAN THOSE WHO GRADUATE IN FOUR YEARS SO IT'LL BUT SET. UP EQUITY. THE. STUDENTS TO HAVE A GREAT IN A TIMELY MANNER AND WE HAVE A SEAT PROGRAMS WE'D LIKE TO UNDERTAKE INCLUDING SUMMER COHORTS TO HELP STUDENTS TAKE CLASSES DURING THE SUMMER TO KEEP THEM ON ACADEMIC TRACK. BECAUSE WE ARE FINDING THAT WE HAVE A LOT OF STUDENTS WHO ARE GRADUATING. IN FIVE YEARS PARTLY BECAUSE THEY MAY HAVE MISSED OF COURSE THAT'S ONLY OFFERED IN THE SPRING TIME. AND THEN THEY HAVE TO STAY LONGER IN ORDER TO TAKE THAT COURSE SO WE WANT TO TRY TO GET THEM- ESPECIALLY IF THEY MISS A SEAT COURSE IN A SERIES TO TAKE THOSE IN A SUMMERTIME SO THAT THEY CAN GRADUATE ON TIME. OF WE ALSO WANT TO INVEST IN OUR FACULTY WE WANT TO HIRE AN ADDITIONAL ELEVEN HUNDRED FACULTY FOR OUR CAMPUSES. OF TO PROVIDE MENTORING AND INSTRUCTION OF FOR OUR STUDENTS THAT THE FOUR YEAR PLAN FOR THOSE ELEVEN HUNDRED FACULTY BY REQUESTING SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS THESE EFFORTS. IN TWENTY TWENTY. TWENTY ONE. LET ME ASK A QUESTION HERE WITH THE GOVERNOR'S ACTIVE OF PARTICIPATION OBVIOUSLY- OF- WE DID THIS SUMMER. WE JUST GOT SUMMER CAL GRANT IT'S A DIFFERENT SUMMER TUITION ASSISTANCE SEVEN EIGHT PROGRAM FINANCIAL AID. THAT WAS IN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET AND THE GOVERNOR'S CONTINUED THAT- IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET- HAS UC DESIGN SOME SORT OF A- SYSTEM OF TRYING TO. RECOVER DATA AND APPLY SOME METRICS ANALYSIS TO THIS PROGRAM TO SEE WHAT THE ACTUAL RESULT IS AND WHETHER THERE'S A COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS OF THERE'S A COST BENEFIT- CONNECTION HERE UP I'M GLAD YOU pBRIDGE AND YOU MENTIONED SUMMERS SO IT'S A NATURAL ORIGIN I THINK IT IS ON A SLIGHT EIGHTEEN I HAVE A GRAPH TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION HOPEFULLY. OF SHOWING THAT IN THE LAST YEAR NOW THAT SUMMER- OF FINANCIAL AID IS IN PLACE WE SAW A JUMP OF THREE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED HEAD COUNT STUDENTS ATTENDING SUMMER- BUT OVER THE LAST OF FIVE YEARS WE'VE SEEN A GROWTH IN TEN THOUSAND HEAD COUNT STUDENTS ATTENDING SUMMER THESE ARE STUDENTS WERE TAKING AT LEAST ONE COURSE DURING THE SUMMER. SO WE THINK WE ARE SEEING UP THIS IN THE OF THREE DOT ONE HUNDRED STUDENTS THINK IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE FINANCIAL AID AND- WE'VE MET HOW DO WE SEE IF WE CAN CONNECT THOSE ATTENDING AN EARLY GRADUATION. SYSTEM BODY WHOSE TAKING A SUMMER COURSE NOT SO THEY SHOULDN'T BE HERE THEY WOULDN'T. YOU KNOW THEY OBVIOUSLY NEED FINANCIAL AID SO I WOULD THINK THEY'D BE JUDICIOUS WITH WHAT THEY TAKE AND HOW LONG THEY STAY AROUND BUT- TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S NOT A FINE ARTS COURSE THAT'S OF. AN EXTRA SUPPOSED TO OF COURSE IT'S ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL TOWARD READ THE GREEK COMPLETION OUR CAMPUSES ARE EXAMINING WHERE THE BOTTLE NECK COURSES ARE. THAT MAY BE SLOWING STUDENTS DOWN THOSE ARE THE COURSES THAT HAVE- EITHER REACH 100% ENROLLMENT OR CLOSE TO IT DURING THE YEAR- AND LOOKING OUT HOW THEY COULD MOVE THAT SOME OF THOSE COURSES DUPLICATE THEM DURING THE SUMMER TIME. TO ENCOURAGE STUDENTS WHO MAY NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GET INTO A COURSE DURING THE ACADEMIC YEAR TO THEN TAKE THAT COURSE DURING THE SUMMER AND WILL WE BE ABLE TO TELL WHETHER. WELL THAT. JANE RECEIVED A SUMMER FINANCIAL AID AND THAT. JANE ULTIMATELY GRADUATED. A SEMESTER EARLY OR WE WILL BE I WILL BE DOWN TO THAT LEVEL OF DETAIL THAT BECAUSE WE DON'T NEED THAT BUT WHAT WE WOULD NEED IS WHAT THE IMPACT OF THE PROGRAM HAS BEEN. WE WILL BE ABLE TO GET THAT DATA ONCE STUDENTS START GRADUATING SO WE USUALLY LOOK AT FROM FRESHMAN. LOOK THE FOUR YEARS AND THENCE A FIVE AND SIX AND SO IT TAKES SEVERAL YEARS FOR THAT DATA TO COME IN BUT WHAT WE WOULD LOOK AT IS AVERAGES. WITHIN A CERTAIN STUDENT TYPE SO WE MIGHT LOOK AT A PELL GRANT RECIPIENT WHO IS A U. R. G. WHO ATTENDED AS A FRESHMAN AND- OF. THEN WOULD LOOK HOW LONG DID IT TAKE THAT PERSON DOES THAT PERSON TO GRADUATE AND- START LOOKING AT IF THE AVERAGES FOR SIR. HI OUR- WELL I WOULD IMAGINE OF GIVEN THE WAY THE BUDGET WORKS IN THE STATE. FOR THOSE WHO BETTER A LOT LONGER THAN I HAVE BEEN- AT SOME POINT IN TIME WHEN BUDGETS BECOME EVEN MORE CHALLENGED- HOPEFULLY WE WILL HAVE SOME DATA BECAUSE WITH BUDGET PRESSURES. I THINK IT WILL BE VERY VERY IMPORTANT TO DEMONSTRATE THAT THIS PROGRAM ACTUALLY HAS AN IMPACT AND AFFECT ON GETTING. YOUNG AND NOT SO YOUNG FOLKS THROUGH OUR UC SYSTEM YOU KNOW EARLIER. AND SOMEONE CAN DO A COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS OF THAT MAKE IT YOU KNOW AND IF IT IS BENEFICIAL CONTINUE THE PROGRAMS OF THANK YOU FOR WORKING THAT YET WAIT WE HAVE A GREAT INSTITUTIONAL RESEARCH TEAM AT A U. C. O. P. AND I'M CERTAIN THEY'LL GET RIGHT ON THAT AND I SEE PART OF YOUR SIXTY MILLION DOLLAR REQUEST IS HAS TO DO WITH STUDENT ADVISING. AND I THINK WE'RE GONNA GET UP LATER. OF IF I GET THE RIGHT REQUEST I THINK YOU DO SO PART OF THE SIXTY MILLION THIS LOOKING AT. IS GETTING STUDENTS WHO ARE. FALL INTO GROUPS WHO DON'T GRADUATE AT THE SAME OF RADIUS NON PELL RECIPIENTS AND- MAKE CERTAIN THAT THEY HAVE ADDITIONAL ACADEMIC ADVISING LIKE WE'RE STUDENTS WHO ARE FALLING BEHIND- IN THEIR- ACADEMIC PLANS HAVING MID TERMS CHECK INS WITH AN ADVISER. OR HAVING EVEN MORE IN DEPTH- HANDS ON ASSISTANCE LIKE. THE START MISSING- THEY MISS AND EXAMINED THEIR COURSE. THE PROFESSOR CAN LET THE ADVISER NO HOOKED AND CHECKS IN WITH THE STUDENTS TO SEE WHAT THEIR IF SOMETHING IS HAPPENING IN THEIR LIVES AND WHAT WE FIND IS THAT OTHER. THINGS AROUND THINGS LIKE INS- INSECURITY ABOUT HOUSING INSECURITY ABOUT FOOD STUDENT MENTAL HEALTH MAY BE IMPACTING WHETHER OR NOT THAT STUDENT HAS THAT CONTINUITY AND COULD HAVING AN ADVISER WHO CONNECTS THEM TO SERVICES ON THE CAMPUS MAKES A BIG DIFFERENCE. WE CAN TO I THINK THERE'S SOME OTHER DISCUSSION ABOUT- PROBABLY AND STUDENT FEES SERVICES SECTION ON ECONOMIC COUNSELING BUT YES. I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT- CATCHER TO STUDENT RATIOS BOTH IN THE ACADEMIC IN THE MENTAL HEALTH SIDE AND- BECAUSE IT OCCURS TO ME THAT. ON THE GRADUATION RATE INITIATIVES WHICH- YOU HAVE ONE BUT CERTAINLY SEE ISSUE AS THE MAN. THE ACADEMIC HOUSING MUST PLAY A PRETTY IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE AVAILABILITY OF CANCERS AND MAKING SURE THAT STUDENTS GET THROUGH THE PIPELINE. YOU KNOW ON TIME ON TARGET WITH THE DEGREE THAT THEY THINK THEY'RE WELL I HAVE. YES WE'RE FINDING IT THAT IT'S VERY IMPORTANT YES OKAY. AND THEN PUT CAN MAKE MAYBE TALK ABOUT YOU SEE EXTENDED EDUCATION OR ARE YOU GOING TO GET TO THAT- I JUST HAVE A BRIEF STATMENT ON THAT- THAT. WE'RE INTENDING TO LEVERAGE THE ONE TIME FUNDS THAT WE RECEIVED FROM THE STATE OF TO EXPAND OUR DEGREE AND WORK FOR CERTIFICATE ATTAINMENT GOALS AT THE EXTENSION PROGRAMS. OF WE RECENTLY- REQUESTED OUR CAMPUSES TO PUT TOGETHER PROPOSALS FOR HOW THEY WOULD UTILIZED THAT FIFTEEN MILLION THAT WE GOT IN THE CURRENT YEAR WE JUST GOT BACK SEVEN DIFFERENT PROPOSALS. UP FROM OUR CAMPUSES AND WE'RE LOOKING- WE'RE CURRENTLY LOOKING AT THESE PROPOSALS THE C. WHICH ONES WE THINK WOULD INCREASE DEGREE ATTAINMENT THE MOST OF AND ALSO THE WHIC PROGRAMS ARE COULD BECOME SELF SUSTAINING AFTER BIRTH IS FOR MORE MONEY. YES THANK YOU AND BEFORE YOU SPENT THE LAST PLEASE. WE HAVE NOT YET SPENT THE LAST BEES BUT WE DID JUST GET BACK THOSE PROPOSALS FROM OUR CAMPUSES ON HOW HOW THEY WOULD GO ABOUT SPENDING THEM WHAT I LOOK FOR I LOOK FORWARD TO HAVING A CONTINUED CONVERSATION ABOUT THE I MEAN I REALIZE THIS IS IN YOUR PROPOSAL BUT- IT. HAS BECOME YOUR RAM IF IT HAS AND WE MADE A GOVERNOR YEAH WE PUSHED THE GOVERNOR'S COMP IN US AND CREATING MORE PREPAYMENT YOU KNOW I HAVE LOTS OF QUESTIONS I DON'T REMEMBER IF I AS. THE MOST YOUR- YOU KNOW WAS A BERNIE BASED. THE DECIDED THAT WE NEEDED TO DO THIS AND IF SO WHAT WERE THE RESULTS AND WHO WERE THE STUDY PARTICIPANTS I'M AND I'M JUST THESE A RHETORICAL BECAUSE AGAIN YOU YOU ALL YOU SEE WAS NOT NECESSARILY INVOLVED IN. IN THIS TOGETHER AS YOU MAY KNOW I SPENT A FEW. CHERISHED HOURS- WITH COMMUNITY COLLEGE FOLKS TALKING ABOUT THE CAL BRED ONLINE- COLLEGE THAT. IN SOME RESPECTS APPEARS TO BE FOCUSED ON THE SAME ISSUE WHICH IS YOU KNOW WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AND- JUST. PERHAPS DEGREE BUT CERTAINLY NON DEGREE- PROGRAMS IN THE WORKPLACE AND- IT SEEMS TO ME THAT WE PROBABLY OUGHT TO COORDINATE ALL THESE EFFORTS SOME AL ONCE WE DETERMINE WHO'S THE BEST WHERE THE BEST PLACES TO HOUSE THESE PROGRAMS- I REALIZE EXTENSION IS A SELF. IS A- I WANT TO SEE A PROFIT CENTER BUT IT'S A SELF SUPPORTING OPERATION. YES IT'S A SELF SUPPORTING OPERATION- SOME OF THE QUESTIONS THAT YOU HAVE. MAY BE LATER ANSWERED BY THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED LONGER TO ROLL DATA SYSTEM THAT WILL LINK DATA FROM HIGH SCHOOL OF FROM. HIGH SCHOOLS OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES CSU AND YOU SEE TOGETHER TO SEE THE CORPS STAKING PATTERNS OF STUDENTS AND WHETHER OR NOT THEY END UP GETTING A DEGREE OR CERTIFICATE. AND ONCE THAT SYSTEM WHICH IS NOW AND IN ITS PLANNING FACES ONCE THAT'S BEEN ESTABLISHED THAT MIGHT YIELD A LOT MORE INFORMATION TO ANSWER SOME OF THESE COMPLEX QUESTIONS. RIGHT I AS I SAID TO THE CAL RIGHT FOLKS IT'S NOT YOUR CONCERN BUT I SAID YOU KNOW THESE THESE ARE PROBABLY VALUABLE CONCEPTS AND VALUABLE PROGRAMS A QUESTION IS. HOW WE DESIGN AND HOW WE IMPLEMENT THEM WHAT THE GOALS AND OBJECTIVES ARE AND HOW WE MEASURE WHAT WE'VE DONE AND- WHETHER WHAT WE'VE DONE IS THE RIGHT THING TO HAVE DONE. WE SORT OF PUT THE MONEY AHEAD OF THE ANALYSIS IS AND THE LONGITUDINAL DATA SYSTEM ONCE IT'S UP AND RUNNING WHICH IS AN WHICH IS AN EXCELLENT. COMMEND THE ADMINISTRATION AN EXCELLENT. A PROPOSAL AND AN EXCELLENT SYSTEM- THAT WILL PROVIDE I'M SURE SUPERB RESULTS ONCE IT'S- FULLY FUNCTIONAL- IT'LL TAKE US AWHILE TO GET THERE AND IN THE MEANTIME. WE'RE TRYING A BUNCH OF THINGS I GUESS WELL ANYWAY ALL OF THE LABOR THIS SIDE IT JUST TO IT I JUST HAVE A- I JUST HAVE SOME CONCERNS. A LOT OF MONEY. OF ALL THE ALL THE- SELF SUPPORTING CERTIFICATE GRANTING PROGRAMS OUT THERE THE UC EXTENSIONS ARE PROBABLY. THE MOST ETHICAL ONES THAT CARE THE MOST ABOUT THIS ACTUAL STUDENT OUTCOMES SO WIPED ME RIGHT I MEAN I WOULD I TAUGHT. AT THE EXTENSION PROGRAM SO I'M A BELIEVER IN THE EXTENSION PROGRAM. I JUST QUESTION WHAT WE'RE DOING WITH THIS ONE BUT WE'LL HAVE TO SEE HOW IT. HOW YOU ALL IMPLEMENTED IN AND WHAT THE PLAN IS WHEN YOU COME BACK WITH THE PLAN WITH RESPECT TO THE. WITH RESPECT TO UNDOCUMENTED STUDENTS FOSTER USE THAN PREVIOUSLY INCARCERATED. NOW WE HAVE SOME SMALL PER RIFF ON OUR ANALYSIS AT PAGE THIRTY ONE I DON'T NOW IF YOU HAVE OUR ANALYSIS- THE TALKS ABOUT- THE SPENDING YOUR OF YOU SEE SPENDING PLAN INCLUDED TWENTY MILLION ON GOING YEAH BY THESE SERVICES- NOT. INCLUDED THERE WASN'T NO ADDITIONAL FUNDING IN THE BUDGET THAT WAS SPECIFIED FOR THESE PURPOSES YES THIS THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA REGENTS REQUEST. OF COULD I GO THROUGH OR SAY PEPPER QUEST REALLY QUICKLY DO ANYTHING YOU'D LIKE THANK YOU SIR THIS FOR YOU- BUT I DO WANT YOU TO TELL ME HOW THOSE CURRENTLY THOSE. STUDENT NEEDS ARE OURS ADDRESSED NOW WHEN WE GET TO THAT OKAY THAT'S THAT'S IN A MOMENT SO ON SLIDE NINETEEN. OF THE UC REGENTS ARE REQUESTING TWENTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS TO EXPAND THE SO CALLED STUDENT ACADEMIC PREPARATION AN EDUCATIONAL PARTNERSHIP PROGRAMS. AND IT WAS OUR STUDENTS WHO CAME TO THE REGION'S WITH THIS PROPOSAL AND REQUESTED MORE SERVICES. TO HELP RECRUIT STUDENTS INTO THE UC SYSTEM AND TO PROVIDE THEM WITH ASSISTANCE WALTER AND ROLLED. SO THAT THEY CAN- ATTAIN THOSE UP. POSITIVE OUTCOMES FOR THEMSELVES AND THEIR SUPER PROGRAMS GO INTO HIGH SCHOOLS ALL AROUND CALIFORNIA- IN. SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN OF WE REACHED OVER TWO HUNDRED AND TEN THOUSAND STUDENTS IN CALIFORNIA. OF AND WITH THESE ADDITIONAL FUNDS WE COULD SHEPHERD EVEN MORE YOUNG PEOPLE INTO OPPORTUNITIES TO ALLOW THEM TO GROW INTELLECTUAL AND ACHIEVE GREATER ECONOMIC OUTCOMES. IN THE LONG RUN OF THERE'S THIRTEEN SAY BY PROGRAMS IN TOTAL THEY GO THROUGH THE ENTIRE EDUCATIONAL PIPELINE FROM THE PRE SCHOOL TO GRADUATE EDUCATION. AND THEY PRIMARILY SERVED THE STATE'S FIRST GENERATION LOW INCOME AND UNDER REPRESENTED STUDENTS IN SCHOOLS WHERE THEY ATTEND. AND WE HAVE SEEN SIGNIFICANT- OF. OUTCOMES FOR THESE PROGRAMS WHERE STUDENTS WHO UP PARTICIPATE IN SAY PAP AND UP COMPLETING A THROUGH G. AT MUCH HIGHER RATES THAN STUDENTS- IT DOES DISTRICTS WHO DO NOT. PARTICIPATE IN THE SUPER PROGRAM. SO WE ARE REQUESTING TWENTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS CURRENTLY THE PROGRAM IS BUDGETED TO RECEIVE TWENTY FOUR POINT FIVE MILLION SO THAT'S A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE FOR THEIR BUDGET. BUT IF ALLOW US TO DO A LOT OF GOOD SO YOU'RE ASKING TWENTY THREE MILLION ON TOP OF THE TWENTY FOUR POINT FIVE THAT'S CORRECT. AND THEN. GO INTO OUR SERVICES FOR THE VULNERABLE STUDENT GROUPS- THAT'S ON SLIDE TWENTY. SO WE ARE REQUESTING TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS OF WHICH WOULD BE DIVIDED INTO THREE. OF POOLS TEN MILLION FOR SERVICES TO UNDOCUMENTED STUDENTS. SIX MILLION DOLLARS FOR FORMER FOSTER YOUTH. AND FOUR MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE FORMERLY INCARCERATED STUENTS. AND CURRENTLY- THE ON DOCUMENTS STUDENTS CENTERS ON THE CAMPUSES WERE STARTED WITH PRESIDENTIAL INITIATIVE FUNDING FROM UC OP. THEY WERE APPROVED ON A THREE YEAR PLAN TO GET THE GET THE CENTER STARED WITH THE INTENT THAT THEY WOULD THEN. MOVE ON TO OTHER FUNDING SOURCES. AND AS YOU MAY BE AWARE. A UC OP BUDGET HAS BEEN FELL HELD FLAT NOW IS PROPOSED FOR THE FOURTH YEAR AS ACTUALLY GONE DOWN A LITTLE BIT. OF WE HAVE BEEN UTILIZING RESERVES AND HAVE BEEN TRANSFERRING TO UC OP RESERVES TO THE CAMPUSES. SO USE YOUR P. NO LONGER HAS THE CAPACITY TO CONTINUE THESE- PROGRAMS TO CONTINUE. OF FUNDING TRANSFERS TO THE CAMPUSES FOR THE PURPOSES OF DâN DOCUMENTS STUDENT CENTER BECAUSE THIS IS A REALLY WONDERFUL POPULATION WE ARE REQUESTING THAT- YOU PROVIDE US WITH TEN MILLION DOLLARS TO CONTINUE SUPPORTING THEM. THE CENTERS PURPOSE IS TO PROVIDE ACADEMIC ADVISING CRITICS STUDENTS TO LOOK UP SOCIAL SERVICES AND CONNECT THEM TO LEGAL SERVICES. OF IT IS A DIFFERENT OF FUNCTION THAN THE LEGAL CENTER THAT IS A HOUSE THAT UC DAVIS WHERE WE HAVE THE LAWYERS WHO SPECIFICALLY HELP STUDENTS WITH THEIR IMMIGRATION PAPERWORK. THIS IS MORE OF THE- CONNECTING TO CAMPUS SERVICES AND GIVING STUDENTS A HOME BASE WHERE THEY CAN FEEL LIKE THEY BELONG SO THESE PROGRAM BUT ALL OF THEM ALL THESE THREE PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN ENOUGH. HAVE BEEN IN EXISTENCE FOR THREE YEARS. ONLY THE UNDOCUMENTED STUDENT OF CENTERS HAVE BEEN IN EXISTENCE FOR THREE YEARS THE FORMERLY INCARCERATED STUDENTS CURRENTLY HAVE ONE CENTER IT'S LOCATED BERKELEY- AND THE OTHER CAMPUSES HAVE MORE SOCIAL CLUBS THEY ARE NOT FUNDED. AND THEY DON'T HAVE A HOME BASE SO THEY DON'T HAVE A PHYSICAL SPACE ON THE OTHER CAMPUSES. OF THE BERKELEY UNDERGROUND SCHOLARS PROGRAM WAS ESTABLISHED IN TWENTY SIXTEEN AND IN THE SHORT TIME THAT THEY'VE BEEN IN EXISTENCE THEY HAVE ACHIEVED A THE COHORT THAT THEY STARTED WITH IN TWENTY SIXTEEN FOR THOSE TRANSFER STUDENTS THEY'VE HAD A 1100% GRADUATION RATE. AS WELL SO THEY ARE SHOWING REMARKABLE ACHIEVEMENT IN GETTING THE STUDENTS THROUGH I WILL SAY OF COURSE ARE. FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE BEEN INCARCERATED WHO DO GET INTO BERKELEY THEY HAVE TO BE IMMENSELY MOTIVATED. AND PROBABLY. WAY BETTER THAN I COULD EVER BE OF SO FOR THEM TO GRADUATE IN A 100% RATE THEY'RE PROBABLY EXCELLENT TOP STUDENTS TO BEGIN WITH. I'M IN THE FACT THAT 69% OF THE- FRESHMAN ADMITS HAVE GPAS OF THREE POINT EIGHT OR ABOVE SOMEBODY'S OBVIOUSLY VERY BRIGHT WHAT ABOUT. SO THOSE ARE METRICS AND THOSE ARE VALUABLE AND TO US IN TRYING TO ASSESS WHETHER OR NOT. YOU KNOW THE STATE RESOURCES THAT ARE AVAILABLE SHOULD BE DIRECTED TO THE PROGRAM WAT ABOUT THE FOSTER USE AND UNDOCUMENTED STUDENTS IN PARTICULAR THE UNDOCUMENTED STUDENTS. THE PROGRAM HAS BEEN IN EXISTENCE FOR SERVING MORE THAN A YEAR HAVE HAVE AS YOU SEE BEEN ABLE TO DEVELOP SOME METRICS TO DETERMINE. SUCCESS OR FAILURE WHEN IT COMES TO THIS PARTICULAR TYPE OF PROGRAM FORGET THE LEGAL PIECE FOR RIGHT NOW I DON'T HAVE- ANY DATA. IF ON THE RETENTION AND GRADUATION RATE OF THE UNDOCUMENTED STUDENT POPULATION AT THIS TIME- A THAT'S SIMILAR. THREE YEARS SO YOU'VE DEPENDING ON WE DEMAND THE PROGRAM IT MAY NOT BE. LONG ENOUGH BUT I WOULD HOPE THAT WE WOULD BE. PUTTING TOGETHER SOME. REPORT CARDS SO THOSE PEOPLE WHO HAVE TO TRIAGE AND MAKE DECISIONS ON SCARES RELATIVELY SCARCE RESOURCES MAY BE GETTING MORE SCARCE WHETHER IT'S THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE FOR THE LA- TO COMMENT TO PEOPLE LIKE US WHO HAVE TO VOTE WE CAN ASSESS WHICH PROGRAMS. TO CONTINUE. MAKING DIFFICULT CHOICES AMONG. ALL EXTRA EARLY WORTHWHILE PROGRAMS. OF THAT'S CORRECT SIR- I WILL SEE WHAT KIND OF DATA WEEK WE HAVE AND WHAT MAY BE AVAILABLE TO PROVIDE THIS COMMITTEE. PERFECT AND I WOULD JUST SY ON THE FORMER FOSTER USE OF THIS OF POPULATION THAT IS EXTREMELY VULNERABLE OBVIOUSLY THEY ARE- WITHOUT ANY PARENTAL SUPPORT THEIR PARENTS ARE EITHER DEAD OR INCARCERATED- WE CURRENTLY DO HAVE SMALL SERVICES OF FOR THESE FOR FOSTER YOUTH ON OUR CAMPUSES AND THIS WOULD BE ABOUT A DOUBLING OF THE RESOURCES AVAILABLE WE SPENT A FAIR. SINCE THE AGE OF AND WHEN THEY AGE OUT THERE STILL VERY VERY YOUNG. RELATIVELY SPEAKING AND WITHOUT SUPPORT STRUCTURE AND- A MEAL. A DEADLY GET A SYMPATHETIC EAR HERE AMONG MY COLLEAGUES FOR PROVIDING SERVICES IN ASSISTANCE TO THIS YOU KNOW COMMUNITY. I JUST THINK WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO. HOW TO QUANTIFY WHAT YOU DO AND HOW TO ASSESS. UNDOUBTEDLY THE GOOD WORK THAT YOU WERE DOING AND DOCUMENT IT SO. WHEN WE'RE FACED WITH CUTS IN. WHAT THE FUND WHAT NOT TO FUND WHETHER IT'S INSIDE YOU SEE OR ELSEWHERE WE TAKE A LOOK AT THIS AND- PROVIDE THE APPROPRIATE AMOUNT OF ATTENTION. TO THE PROGRAM SO I'M SURE YOU'LL HELP ME. YES I WILL. IS THAT IT THAT'S IT FOR- FOR OUR X. DEGREE ATTAINMENT REQUEST WELL LET'S SOME OKAY LET'S HAVE WE WERE ON EXTENSION AND MY COLLEAGUES TO MY RIGHT WERE KIND ENOUGH TO LISTEN TO ME FEB SO LET ME LET YOU WALL COMMENT ON THE EXTENSION PROGRAM FRONT OF FINANCE THANK YOU. THANK YOU CHAIR THING FOR THE INTEREST IN THE EXTENSION WILL JUST BRIEFLY. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET DOES INCLUDE FOUR MILLION ONE TIME. FOR EXPANDING- DEVELOPING- YOU SEE EXTENSION PROGRAMS JUST TO RESPOND TO SOME OF THE HELPFUL QUESTIONS YOU RAISE YOUR ONE IS NINE ONE IS DISTINGUISHING BETWEEN. IT YOU KNOW THE ONLINE COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND YOU SEE EXTENSION AND IN OUR VIEW THE ROOT. POPULATIONS WERE TRYING TO ADDRESS ARE DIFFERENT THAN THE WAY. THAT THE SYSTEMS WORK OUR FRIEND THE ONLINE COMMUNITY COLLEGE THAT'S A MUCH BROADER AUDIENCE. AND FOR THE UC EXTENSION WERE SPECIFICALLY AIMING IT AT ADULT STUDENTS WHO HAVE SOME UNITS. AND TRY TO GET THOSE STUDENTS RE ENROLLED IN HIGHER EDUCATION SO THEY CAN PURSUE A BACHELOR'S LEVEL DEGREE. WERE ALSO ENCOURAGING OPEN TO. CERTIFICATE LEVEL DEGREE BUT THE BAT THIS IS A BIG FOCUS AT THE UC EXTENSION. IN WHAT WE INVESTED THE MILLIONS TIME LAST YEAR AND WHY WERE PROPOSED FOR MILLION THIS YEAR. A TO DISTINGUISH FROM LAST YEAR AND THIS YEAR THIS IS POST FOCUSED ON LINE. PRO THAT'S BECAUSE THE ADULT POPULATION HAS A HIGHER LEVELS OF CONSTRUED IT'S THEIR DAILY LIVES SO ONLINE IS A GOOD WAY TO. TO REACH THEM. SO THAT'S EIGHTY. HIGH LEVEL LET IT OVERLAPS ULTIMATELY BE VIEWED AS- THE COMMUNITY HELPS YOU KNOW IT'S NOT GOING TO TAKE TO THAT. LEVEL OF ASSIST IN THE WAY THAT YOU SIX WHAT. AND FOR I THINK OF. WE'RE GOING TO FIGURE OUT THIS P. RATHER. BUT LET ME ASK ME ASK A QUESTION AND I DIDN'T ASK IT SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT FOLKS WHO. HAVE ATTENDED A FOUR YEAR INSTITUTION PRESUMABLY AND BUT DIDN'T QUITE COMPLETED AGREE I THINK THAT'S WHAT AND I REMEMBER THAT FROM LAST YEAR HOW DIFFICULT IS IT TO A RE INTEGRATE INTO TO TRADITIONAL. FOUR YEAR INSTITUTIONS PROGRAMMING STREAM TO COMPLETE THE COURSE OF TWO OR FOR THAT A PERSON NEEDS IN ORDER TO GET THAT DEGREE. BECAUSE ONE OF THE ISSUES APPARENTLY AND- FIRING UP THIS EXTENSION PROGRAM I GUESS IS TO ALLOW SOMEONE TO COME BACK AFTER FOR FIVE YEARS AND PICK UP YOU KNOW THE UPPER DIVISION ENGLISH COURSE FOR. HISTORY COURSE YOUR MATH COURSE WERE FOUR FIVE OF THEM NECESSARY TO. ACHIEVE A DEGREE FROM SOMEWHERE. IS THAT A FAIR QUESTION WHAT IS WHAT IS THE PROCESS AND HOW DIFFICULT IS IT AND WHAT OBSTACLES WILL THE EXTENSION PROGRAM OVERCOME THAT EXIST IN THE CURRENT. SAID A PROGRAM I'M NOT CERTAIN ARE BECAUSE I HAVEN'T SEEN THE PROPOSALS FOR MY EXTENSION HOW THEY INTEND TO OVERCOME THE PROBLEMS THAT THE OR THE OBSTACLES THAT THE STUDENTS FACE WE DO KNOW THAT TUDENTS WHO ARE RETURNING ARE OLDER THEY OFTEN HAVE FAMILIES AND CHILDREN THEY MAY HAVE SOME CHILD CARE ISSUES GOING ON AND THEN- THEY DO NEED TO FIND A TIME FOR COURSE WORK IN BETWEEN HAVING AN ACTUAL. OF POTENTIALLY A FULL TIME JOB SO OF COURSE NOT THAT MY- ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY FIVE UNITS AT- AT. UC MERCED. AGE OUT FIVE YEARS LATER. THEIR YOUR UNITS WOULD STILL BE GOOD IT'S JUST GETTING THAT STUDENT TO COME BACK AND COMPLETE AND WE DO THINK THAT THERE'S A LOT OF OPPORTUNITY WE DID AN ANALYSIS. OF STUDENTS WHO LEAVE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA WITHOUT OF COMPLETING A DEGREE WE FOUND OUT THAT ABOUT 36% OF THEM HAVE OVER ONE HUNDRED UNITS COMPLETED. SOME MAJORS ONLY NEED HUNDRED TWENTY UNITS SO THEY'RE VERY VERY CLOSE AND IF WE COULD CAPTURE DOT POPULATION BRING THEM BACK AND HAVE THEM COMPLETE THEIR DEGREES. THEY WOULD HAVE MUCH GREATER ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES. WHETHER A LOT OF ISSUES FINANCIAL AID COST ME IN THE WE NEED AT SOME POINT IF THIS. PROGRAM. DEVELOP SWINGS AND EXPANDS WILL HAVE TO ADDRESS BUT IT'S I DON'T WANT TO BELABOR IT IT'S A FAIRLY MINOR INVESTMENT IN A- AND- IN AN EXPERIMENT IS OF CALL IT AND- WILL MOVE FORWARD LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING WHICH PLAN LOOKS LIKE LA- YOU MIGHT HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY. SIR I JUST IN OUR ANALYSIS WE RAISED EXACTLY THE SAME CONCERN SO YOU'RE RAISING NOW IN ASKING QUESTIONS ABOUT NOW TRYING TO INVESTIGATE MORE. WE THE PROBLEM STATEMENT STILL REMAINS UNCLEAR TO LAST WEEK THERE ARE MANY MILLIONS OF STUDENTS WITH IN CALIFORNIA OF SOME CALLS BUT NO DEGREE BUT THERE'S A LOT OF ANALYSIS LACKING AS TO HOW MANY OF THE STUDENTS. WANT TO COME BACK TO SCHOOL AND GET ABOUT HIS DEGREE MIGHT BARRIERS THEY- FACE. ON THAT WOULD PRESUMABLY BE THE FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION- THAT THE ADMINISTRATION WOULD WOULD SEEK TO ANSWER BEFORE- DE IDENTIFYING A SOLUTION TO IT- EVEN TO THE EXTENT THAT- THE PROBLEM IS IDENTIFIED- WE ALSO KNOW THAT THERE A LOT OF. OPTIONS REENTRY OPTIONS CURRENTLY INCLUDING- EXISTING PROGRAMS AT CSU EXTENSION THAT OUR BACHELOR'S DEGREE COMPLETION PROGRAMS. IT BEYOND ALL THAT TO ADD EXTENSION PROGRAMS BOTH THE UC AND CSU ARE SELF SUPPORTING AS YOU NOTED- THROUGH STUDENT FEES WAS IT IS UNCLEAR TO US WHY STATE FUNDING IS NEEDED. PARTICULARLY BECAUSE ONE OF THE OF. A JOBS OF AN EXTENSION PROGRAM IS TO MAINTAIN RESERVES THAT IT CAN THEN USE TO PLAN FOR FUTURE PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT. AND THEN FINALLY WE THINK IT'S PREMATURE- TO PROVIDE FUNDING FOR THE PROGRAM PROGRAM GIVEN THAT. A SIMILAR PROGRAM INITIATIVES FUNDED LAST YEAR'S BUDGET LEGISLATURE AS LITTLE INFORMATION AS TO HOW THOSE FUNDS WILL BE SPENT IN. OTHER RELATIVE SUCCESS SO IT'S A LITTLE PREMATURE TO RENT THEM UP AT THIS TIME RECOMMEND REJECTING THIS PROPOSAL IN THIS YEAR. WELL HELLO I WAS TRAINED AS A LAWYER WHICH MEANS I WAS TRAINED TO BE AN OBSTRUCTIONIST ANNA. AND MISTER NO I THAT'S NOT MY CURRENT JOB AND SO I'D LIKE TO TRY TO. IF THIS IS OF INTEREST TO THE ADMINISTRATION pSECOND YEAR. I'D LIKE TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN MAKE. MAKE WHATEVER IT IS WE'RE DOING- SUCCESSFUL SO I LOOK FORWARD TO THE UC REPORT WORK WITH APPRECIATE YOUR- THOUGHTFUL ANALYSIS- LA- AND- YOUR COMMENTS FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND WE'LL SEE HOW TO MAKE THIS- MAKE THIS AGO ANYTHING ELSE ON THIS. ITEM ONE ONE AREA THAT MIGHT- THE HELP IS- IF YOU'RE IF YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT WHERE WHERE COULD WE WERE THE INFORMATION GAS PROBABLY GETTING MORE INFORMATION ON THE OTHER. ON THE UNDERLYING CAUSES FURTHER STUDYING THE ISSUE. THAT COULD BE ONE POTENTIAL AREA. LEGISLATURE TO FOCUS ATTENTION ONOUR- AS IT'S THINKING ABOUT- IMPROVING WAY STUDENTS CAN ACCESS COLLEGE. WELL AS YOU KNOW THERE'S OF. A CONTINUED. THERE IS A AN ENHANCED. AND FORCED MOVE NOW TO EXPLORE. AND FIELD ONLINE EDUCATIO EFFORTS THAT ARE OCCASIONED BY THIS CURRENT THE SITUATION THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH. AND THE PRODUCT ONE PRODUCT OF THAT MAY BE INCREASED ONLINE OFFERINGS IN AREAS WHERE THERE WAS RESISTANCE TO OFFER THEM BEFORE AND SO WE COULD SEE ONLINE OPPORTUNITIES. IN THE FUTURE EXPAND- IN AREAS WHERE THEY CURRENTLY DO NOT EXIST AND THAT MAY CHANGE THE CALCULUS HERE AS TO WHETHER WE USED THE EXTENSION PROGRAMS FOR THIS PURPOSE OR WHETHER ON ENHANCED ONLINE OPPORTUNITIES ON THE TRADITIONAL. BRICK AND MORTAR CAMPUSES OPEN UP. THE OPPORTUNITY TO COMPLETE DEGREES FOR PEOPLE WHO WERE THERE TEN YEARS AGO OR FIVE YEARS AGO. WHO DON'T WANT TO GO BACK TO THE BRICK AND MORTAR CAMPUS BUT WOULD LIKE TO COMPLETE THEIR DEGREE SO I GUESS THIS IS A MOVING TARGET I APPLAUD THE- ADMINISTRATION'S INITIATIVE TO TRY NEW THINGS AND I DON'T WANT TO THROW. WATER ON THAT EFFORT I THINK WE NEED TO TAKE A LOOK AT EVERYTHING AND ANYTHING. TO IMPROVE THE LOT OF FOLKS WHO WERE JUST TRYING TO MAKE IT SO. THANK YOU FOR DOING IT. NEXT ISSUE SIX ADDRESSING STUDENT BASIC NEEDS HUNGER AND HOMELESSNESS THIS- WE'RE HOLDING ALL THESE- ITEMS OPEN IN CASE OF THOSE IN THE AUDIENCE SEVEN NOTED BUT THIS ONE IS AN INFORMATIONAL ONE. TICKET YES SO- IN THE CURRENT YEAR IN THE BUDGET ACT OF TWENTY NINETEEN THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR PROVIDED YOU SEE. WITH FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS TO START ADDRESSING- STUDENT BASIC NEEDS. THIS WOULD BE DEFINED AS- ISSUES AROUND HUNGER. OF HOMELESSNESS. OF END OF THESE FUNDS WERE IN RESPONSE TO A STUDENT SURVEY THAT UC CONDUCTED BACK IN TWENTY SIXTEEN WHICH FOUND THAT 44% OF OUR UNDERGRADUATE POPULATION AND 25% OF GRADUATE STUDENTS REPORTED HAVING FOOD AND SECURITY. UP AND UP 25% OF UNDERGRADUATE AND 4% OF GRADUATE STUDENTS REPORTED BEING HOMELESS AT SOME POINT DURING THEIR TIME WITH YOU SEE. UP AND FOOD AND SECURITY IS DEFINED AS NOT HAVING ENOUGH MONEY TO PURCHASE. THE FOOD THEY NEED TO EAT FOR THE ENTIRE MONTH SO HAVING TO SKIP MEALS AT SOME POINT BECAUSE OF LACK OF FINANCING. IN THE CURRENT YEAR THE CAMPUSES ARE FOCUSING ON BUILDING UP INFRASTRUCTURE THAT ALLOWS STUDENTS TO MORE EASILY APPLY FOR DOES CAL FRESH BENEFITS. OF THEY'RE LOOKING AT CONNECTING TO CAMPUSES WITH A COUNTY SERVICES. THEY'RE PROVIDING MORE FOOD THROUGH THEIR CAMPUS FOOD BANKS WE NOW HAVE A FOOD BANK. AT OR VERY NEAR EVERY SINGLE OF OUR CAMPUSES. OF AND THEY'RE ALSO HIRING PERMANENT CAMPUS COORDINATORS TO LIVE- MANAGE THE BASIC NEEDS FOR THE CAMPUS. OF WE'VE MANAGED TO END OF EIGHTEEN NINETEEN WHICH IS WHEN WE HAVE ONE POINT FIVE MILLION FROM THE LEGISLATURE SO IN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN YOU GIVE US ONE POINT FIVE MILLION THEN YOU INCREASE THAT SIGNIFICANTLY TO FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE SYSTEM. BUT WITH A ONE POINT FIVE WE MANAGED TO PROVIDE FIFTY THOUSAND STUDENTS. UP WITH SERVICES THROUGH FOOD PANTRIES I END UP WE ALSO ASSISTED UP ALMOST THIRTEEN THOUSAND STUDENTS WITH SUBMITTING CAL FOR SHOP LOCATIONS. UP WHICH GIVES THEM A- GOOD GOOD WAY TO PURCHASE FOOD FOR THEMSELVES. SOME OF THE SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE'RE DOING. THERE'S A LOT OF PARTNERSHIPS BEING DEVELOPED WITH THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND- WITH NONPROFIT ENTITIES IN THE COMMUNITIES TO HELP STUDENTS CONNECT TO BASIC- NEED SERVICES- IN REGARDS THE RAPID RE HOUSING FUNDING YOU SEE THAT ON SLIDE TWENTY TWO. OF WE RECEIVED THREE POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS JUST FOR HOUSING SERVICES. THE WAY WE THE CAMPUSES RECEIVED THESE FUNDS EVER CAMPUS RECEIVED A BASE ALLOCATION AND THEN THE REMAINDER OF THE FUNDS WERE DIVIDED BASED ON THE NUMBER STUDENTS WHO ON THAT CAMPUS REPORTED BEING HOMELESS AT SOME POINT DURING THAT TWENTY SIXTEEN SURVEY THAT WAS CONDUCTED. OF THIS IS THE PERCENTAGE THAT WILL BE RE EXAMINED US YEARS GO ON BECAUSE WE'RE NOW DOING THE SURVEY EVERY TWO YEARS. SO WE WILL HAVE MORE. RESPONDENTS IN THE IN THE FUTURE ON HOW MANY STUDENTS ARE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS ON DUPLICATED HOMELESS MEANS MEANS THAT- SOME STUDENTS REPORTED BEING HOMELESS DURING THE WINTER BREAK AND ALSO DURING THE SUMMER BUT WE'RE ONLY COUNTY THAT WAS ONE. WILL WE WILL WE ULTIMATELY- RECEIVE A REPORT. AS THE LEGISLATURE ON. BOTH BOTH OBVIOUSLY THE- ALLEVIATION OF HUNGER AND THE RAPID RE HOUSING EFFORTS YES FROM WILL SEE YES YOU WORLD THERE ARE STATUTORILY REQUIRED REPORTS I BELIEVE ONE OF THEM UP IS TO VERY SOON WHERE THEY GET DOES IS IT THIS OF ONE OF THE REPORTS GO TO THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE BUDGET COMMITTEE A YES I THINK THAT'S HOW THE STATUTE IS WRITTEN THAT THE REPORTS ALL GO TO THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE BUDGET COMMITTEE WE DO ALSO SEND- THE- DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THE LA- AND- EVERY MEMBER OF THE BUDGET COMMITTEE I BELIEVE GETS A- GOT A COPY. OF THOSE REPORTS BUT- WE WILL MAKE CERTAIN THAT YOU GOT ONE ONCE IT'S RELEASED AND THE REASON I ASK OF COURSE IS I'M LOOKING DOWN HERE AND OF COURSE SOME. CAMPUSES WERE THE USE WORDS LIKE ESTABLISHING A FUND WILL THAT WORK THAT'S GOOD AND WE CAN THE REPORT SHOULD INDICATE. THAT THE FUND WAS ESTABLISHED IN WHAT IN THE HOW IT USED ANOTHER ONE SAYS FORMING A PARTNERSHIP WITH A PARTICULAR COUNTY. TO ENSURE AVAILABILITY SO THE REPORT WOULD INDICATE SHOULD INDICATE THAT THE PARTNERSHIP FOR INFORMED AND WHAT IT'S DOING. AND HOW THE MONEY SPENT OR- PARTNERSHIP WAS NOT FORMED. AND THEN THOSE OF US WHO WERE INTERESTED IN PROVIDING GREASE TO THAT WE'LL COULD APPLY A LITTLE GREASE AND MAKE SURE THAT SOMETHING HAPPENS SO THAT WE TAKE CARE OF. HIM TO TAKE CARE OF THE HOUSING NEEDS OF. OF STUDENTS AS QUICKLY AS WE CAN EXACTLY THE INTENT HERE IS TO REALLY ENSURE THAT OUR STUDENTS. UP ARE SAFE. AND THAT THEY HAVE THEIR OF BASIC HUMAN NEEDS TAKEN CARE OF SO THAT THEY CAN FOCUS ON THEIR STUDIES. I WILL- CHECK IN ON THOSE REPORTS AND MAKE CERTAIN THAT THEY CONTAIN INFORMATION. ABOUT THE ACTUAL STEPS TAKEN AND WHAT THE OUTCOMES WERE. OF THOSE STEPS OF MUCH AS WE CAN REPORT ON A HELPFUL I MEAN I'M YES I DON'T SPEAK FOR MY COLLEAGUES BUT I THINK I COULD SAY THE MIKE. MY COLLEAGUES IN THE LEGISLATURE I'M SURE THAT REPRESENT THESE AREAS- WOULD BE VERY INTERESTED IF. RAPID RE HOUSING EFFORT TO NOT MOVING ALONG QUITE AS SWIFTLY AS THEY SHOULD. NOT BECAUSE OF FUNDING BUT BECAUSE OF A LACK OF PARTICIPATION OR COOPERATION AT SOME LEVEL BELOW US IN EXACTLY- YES I WILL CHECK ON THAT. IN THIS FIRST YEAR HESE RAPID RE HOUSING FUNDS ALLOWED CAMPUSES TO CONDUCT FOCUS GROUPS ON WHY STUDENTS WERE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS AND OF THE KIND OF LIVING CONDITIONS THAT THEY HAD. OF THE FOCUS GROUPS FOUND THAT STUDENTS WERE CHOOSING TO LIVE IN VERY OVERCROWDED SITUATIONS WITH MULTIPLE PEOPLE IN THE SINGLE BEDROOM. OF IN ORDER TO MAKE THEIR MONEY LASTS THROUGHOUT THE YEAR AND THEY WERE ALSO PRIORITIZING HOUSING OVER FOOD. SO THE HOUSING AND SECURITY IS ALSO IMPACTING THE FOODS IN SECURITY FOR THE STUDENTS. OF IN IN THIS BURST YEAR TO CAMPUS ARE FOCUSING ON TWO PRIMARY ACTIVITIES THEY'RE HIRING STAFF WHO ARE BUILDING THESE NETWORKS WITH COMMUNITY HOUSING PROVIDERS. OF AND ADDRESSING THE STUDENT CRISIS SITUATIONS AND THEY'RE ALSO OFFERING TO STUDENTS SMALL EMERGENCY HOUSING GRANTS. BUT THESE ARE JUST A FEW HUNDRED DOLLARS TO ENSURE THAT THE STUDENT DOESN'T LOSE THEIR APARTMENT BECAUSE IT'S A LOT MORE EXPENSIVE ALSO TO GET THE STUDENT INTO HOUSING AGAIN. ONCE THEY HAVE BECOME HOMELESS PARTLY BECAUSE IN A LOT OF THE CITIES NEAR OUR CAMPUSES. THERE'S ONLY A FEW APARTMENT MANAGEMENT COMPANIES AND IF SOMEBODY HASN'T BEEN PAYING THEIR RENT WITH THAT COMPANY AND ONE COMPLEX THEY MIGHT NOT. WANNA RENTED THEM IN ANY F THE COMPLEXES THAT THERE ARE MANAGING SO THAT CREATES A PROBLEM FOR THE STUDENT. AND THEN ON SLIDE TWENTY THREE I JUST WANTED TO GIVE YOU A REALLY QUICK- VISUAL OF THE EFFORTS UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA'S TAKING TO INCREASE STUDENT HOUSING. OF WE HAVE OUR STUDENT HOUSING INITIATIVE THAT HAS ALREADY SINCE TWENTY ELEVEN WE'VE CONSTRUCTED OVER FIFTEEN THOUSAND. OF DORMITORY BEDS AND WE NOW HAVE A PLAN TO CONSTRUCT AND THIS IS. THIS IS THE FIFTEEN THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED BED TO SEE PLANNED BETWEEN FALL TWO TWENTY ONE AND FALL TWENTY FIVE. THOSE ARE ONES FOR WHICH WE HAVE WE BELIEVE WE HAVE THE UP. FINANCING IN PLACE. THERE'S YET EVEN MORE DORMITORY SO WHERE PLANNING FOR WHICH THE FINANCING HASN'T YET BEEN SECURED THESE ARE PRIMARILY P. WHAT ARE CALLED EACE THREE. OF PARTNERSHIPS THE PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP WHERE WE HAVE THE DEVELOPER ALREADY. SELECTED AND WE HAVE THE PROJECT PRETTY MUCH READY TO GO. SO THIS WILL HELP ALSO ALLEVIATE THE SITUATION FOR OUR STUDENTS. OF ANY QUESTIONS ON BASIC NEEDS NO. THANK YOU AND THEN JUST A LITTLE BIT OF INFORMATION- TO UPDATE YOU ON SOME STUDENT MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ISSUES- IS ISSUE SEVEN FOR THOSE OF YOU FOLLOWING ALONG YES ISSUE SEVEN- INFORMATIONAL ITEMS SO YOU SEE DOES HAVE A REQUEST OF FOR FUNDING AROUND STUDENT MENTAL HEALTH WE ARE REQUESTING IT'S A TOTAL OF TEN POINT FOUR MILLION DONE BUT THAT INCLUDES. IS FIVE POINT THREE MILLION NEW MONEY AND THEN IF YOU'LL RECALL BACK IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN WE RECEIVED SOME FUNDING FROM THE LEGISLATURE BUT IT WAS ONE TIME WHEN AWAY PORTION OF THE FUNDING WOULD HAVE BEEN FOR MENTAL HEALTH COUNSELORS AND WE'RE REQUESTING FIVE POINT ONE MILLION FOR THAT. I YOU'LL SEE THAT SUMMARIZED AT THE BOTTOM OF SLIDE TWENTY FOUR. SO. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE ANALYSIS THAT COMMITTEE STAFF PREPARED FOR US. THIS IS ON PAGE THIRTY NINE I WAS LOOKING AT. SOME OF THE STATISTICS 96% OF STUDENTS RECEIVED WITHIN TWO DAYS FOR URGENT MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES AT THE UC COUNSELING AND PSYCHOLOGICAL SERVICES FOR CAPS CENTERS. 99% SAYING WITHIN SEVEN DAYS THAT'S IN THE- TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE REPORT. AND THEN THERE WERE SOME. OTHER STATISTICS. FOR TWENTY EIGHTEEN WHAT'S THE OPTIMUM IS THERE IS THERE SOME STANDARD TO IN THE HIGHER EDUCATION WORLD PUBLIC OR PRIVATE OR PUBLIC AND PRIVATE INSTITUTIONS ARE SORT OF MEASURED BY IN TERMS OF. HOW LONG IT TAKES TO ADDRESS- STUDENTS URGENT MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES AS OF CLOSE TO ONES THAT ARE. MORE ROUTINE IF THE IF YOU EVEN HAVE ROUTINE MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES. OF WHAT THE RATIO WE'RE TRYING TO GET TO IS ONE COUNSELOR FOR EVERY ONE THOUSAND STUDENTS AND ONE PSYCHIATRIST FOR EVERY SIX THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED STUDENTS. AND IN TERMS OF THE NUMBER OF DAYS OF TO SEE A STUDENT I'M NOT CERTAIN WHAT THAT IS IN THE URGENT CASES WE WANT THEM TO GET IMMEDIATE HELP. BUT THE EXTREME CASES MAY ACTUALLY BE TRANSFERRED AWAY TO A MENTAL HEALTH HOSPITAL AWAY FROM CAMPUS- ON A PREPAY I NOTICE THAT CAPS. CENTERS DO NOT PERFORM. DO NOT PROVIDE LONG TERM COUNSELLING AND PSYCHOTHERAPY SERVICES INSTEAD STUDENTS SEARCH REFERRED TO OFFSITE COMMUNITY PSYCHIATRISTS WHEN THIS CARE IS NEEDED IN. MY MARGIN NOTE TO MYSELF WAS WHO PAYS. OF THAT WOULD THE FOUR FORTY OFF SITE CARE IT WOULD BE INSURANCE AND WITH OUR- STUDENT COUNSELING SERVICES IT'S STUDENT FEES TUITION AND STATE GENERAL FUND SO YOUR SHIP STUDENT HEALTH INSURANCE PLAN COVERS THE OFFSIDES. UP I WILL HAVE TO CHECK ON THAT FOR YOU WHAT'S COVERED AND WHAT'S NOT COVERED WITH AND SHIP WELL I WANT TO COMMEND YOU SEE ON A COUPLE FRONTS ONE YOUR- I THE REQUIRE INSURANCE ARE PROVIDED. AT COST INTO YOUR INSURANCE PLAN INCLUDES MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES WOOTEN OTHER. DIVISIONS OF HIGHER EDUCATION AND WE'VE NOT CORRECT THAT NOT YET AND THE TRANSFER WAS DESCRIBED THE OTHER DAY TO ME AS A WARM HAND OFF BETWEEN CAMPUS SERVICES IN THE COMMUNITY ORGANIZATION TO PROVIDE MENTAL HEALTH AND WHEN I ASK. WHO PAYS I WAS TOLD. WELL YOU KNOW. EITHER I DON'T KNOW OR SOMEONE HAS TO ELSE'S TO FIGURE IT OUT AND I COMMEND YOU SEE FOR. ADDRESSING THIS FROM THE BEGINNING TO THE END WE CAN TALK ABOUT WHETHER. TWO DAYS FOR URGENT MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES IS A PROPER TIME FRAME FOR TREATING. STUDENTS BUT SHE ALSO TOLD ME IF IT'S THAT URGENT THEY REFERRED OFF CAMPUS YES THERE IS THEM YEAH IF THEY'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF AN IMMEDIATE MENTAL HEALTH BREAKDOWN THEY ARE REFERRED OFF CAMPUS AND- PRESUMABLY WERE APPARENTLY THE STUDENT- HEALTH INSURANCE PLAN OR THE STUDENTS. INDIVIDUAL HEALTH INSURANCE POLICY YOUR PLAN COVERS ALL OR A PORTION OF THAT TREATMENT WHICH IS GOOD AND YOU'LL GET BACK TO ME ON THAT. YES SO ARE THE IMPEDIMENTS YOU'RE FACING WITH RESPECT TO. DRIVING DOWN THE CASTLE TO STUDENT RATIO OR THE PSYCHIATRIST TO STUDENT RATIO OR BOTH LOOKS LIKE YOUR CATS OF THE STUDENT RATIOS PRETTY GOOD OF WE HAVE MADE REALLY GOOD PROGRESS ON OUR COUNSELORS TO STUDENT RATIO OF AND THAT'S BEEN BECAUSE OF THE INVESTMENTS THAT THE STATE OF HAS BEEN MAKING A BECAUSE WITH THE REGION'S START SETTING ASIDE A PORTION OF OUR STUDENT SERVICES FEE TOWARD HIRING NEW COUNSELORS. OF SOME OF THE ISSUES WE HAVE ARE THE VACANCY RATE. THE OF THE CHARTS ON SLIDE TWENTY FIVE REFLECT. OF THE STUDENTS TO COUNSELOR RATIO IF ALL THE CALLS FOR POSITIONS ARE FILLED BUT WE CURRENTLY HAVE A 10% VACANCY RATE. ON AVERAGE ACROSS THE CAMPUSES SO. THESE ARE THESE. CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGISTS FAMILY. CARE CANCERS WHAT WHAT CATEGORY FOOT WHAT TYPE OF OCCUPATION FITS WITHIN THE COUNSELOR THE COUNSELORS ARE MORE THE OF FAMILY THERAPIST OF. SIR TALK THERAPY OF TO HELP STUDENTS COPE WITH US ISSUES THAT ARE COMING UP WITH THEM IN TERMS OF ISSUES OF LONELINESS ISSUES OF STRESS WITH THE WITH SCHOOL BY ISSUES OF FEAR AROUND HAVING ENOUGH MONEY TO MAKE IT THROUGH THE SCHOOL YEAR. THOSE SORTS OF THINGS THAT- TYPICAL COLLEGE STUDENTS ARE DEALING WITH AND THEN THE PSYCHIATRISTS ARE DEALING MORE WITH THE STUDENTS WHO NEED MEDICATION IN ORDER TO FUNCTION. AND GET THROUGH DAILY DAILY TASKS OUR INTENT OF IN OFFERING THESE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ON OUR CAMPUSES IS TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT WE ESTABLISH A SUPPORTIVE LEARNING ENVIRONMENT FOR ALL OUR STUDENTS. THAT THEY CAN FOCUS ON THEIR STUDIES AND THE VACANCY RATE IS THAT. IN PART A GEOGRAPHIC ISSUE. OF I'M NOT CERTAIN WHAT'S DRIVING OUR VACANCY RATE WHY IT CONTINUES TO BE SO HIGH BECAUSE THIS FOR SEVERAL YEARS THAT IT'S BEEN IN THE 10% RANGE. YEAH BUT IF WE RECEIVE NEW FUNDING FROM THE LEGISLATURE TO WORK ON MENTAL HEALTH IT WOULD ALLOW US TO- CONTINUE HIRING NEW F. T. EITHER IN THE STUDENT COUNSELOR TO STUDENTS PSYCHIATRIST OF CATEGORIES TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT WE DON'T. WE DON'T THAN OF. THIRD LOSING SOME OF THE GOOD WORK THAT WE'VE DONE AND REDUCING THOSE RATES UP ON OUR CAMPUSES BECAUSE WE ARE CONTINUING TO ADMIT MORE MORE STUDENTS AND SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE ARE FINDING AS WE ARE FINDING THAT MORE OF OUR STUDENT BODY AS A PERCENTAGE IS REQUESTING MENTAL HEALTH COUNSELING SERVICES SO BACK IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN WE HAD 9% OF STUDENTS. AT SOME POINT CAME TO SEE A MENTAL HEALTH. A CAME TO MENTAL HEALTH APPOINTMENT. AND NOW- IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN THAT OCCUR ON THE 13% OF OUR STUDENTS. SO NOT ONLY ARE WE INCREASING OUR STUDENTS MORE OF OUR STUDENTS ARE REQUESTING MENTAL HEALTH ASSISTANCE. NO I'M TRYING TO. GET A HANDLE ON WHAT WAS NOT ADDRESSED IN THE BUDGET SO. IT APPEARS AS THOUGH IN ORDER TO. FOR FILL UC'S FIVE YEAR PLAN FOR MENTAL STUDENT MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES WHAT YOU NEED IS THIRTY FIVE POINT TWO MILLION. IS THAT THAT'S ANNUALLY. SO THAT'S NOT THE NUMBER THAT WAS APPROVED BY OUR RIGHT TO ONE OKAY WITHIN THAT THAT THAT TELL ME WHAT NUMBER THAT IS THE NUMBER THAT ARE- DIRECTOR STUDENT MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES- HAS CALCULATED IF WE WERE TO PROVIDE. OF STUDENT MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES IN AN OPTIMAL MANNER OUR REQUEST YOU TODAY'S TEN POINT FOUR MILLION THAT'S THAT'S THE DELTA BETWEEN WHAT YOU GET IN THE BUDGET WHICH IS EITHER ZERO OR SOMETHING AND WHAT YOU NEED. THAT'S WHAT YOU NEED. THAT'S WHAT WE NEED TO HIGHER UP ABOUT TWENTY SIX NEW COUNSELORS AND PSYCHIATRIST TEN POINT TEN POINT FOUR MILLION TEN POINT FOUR MILLION. AND THAT'S ON GOING ON GOING PLEASE YES. AND HOW MANY WITH THAT. ALLOW YOU TO HIRE FTP AT TWENTY SIX SEVENTY. CANCERS AND PSYCHIATRISTS YES THAT'S CORRECT. IN AND THE REGION'S HAVE A PLAN AS TO WHERE YOU WOULD PUT THESE FOLKS. OF WE WOULD WE WOULD DIVIDE THEM. WITHOUT IN BETWEEN OUR CAMPUSES I'M NOT CERTAIN HOW MANY POSITIONS WOULD GO TO EACH CAMPUS BUT I'M CERTAIN THAT WOULD LOOK AT THE NUMBER AMOUNT OF NEED AND THE TYPES OF CASES THAT THE CAMPUSES ARE EXPERIENCING AND GIVEN THE VET GIVEN THE VACANCY RATE THAT YOU'VE- BEEN EXPERIENCING AT LEAST IN WITHIN SOME OF YOUR- POSITIONS YOU YOU ANTICIPATE THE ABILITY TO FILL THESE SLOTS IF YOU. GET THE MONEY I THINK WE WOULD BE ABLE TO DO A LOT OF GOOD WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO FILL ALL OF THOSE SLOTS BUT IF WE CAN FILLED THEM- THERE ARE OTHER PURPOSES. AS WELL THAT WE THINK WOULD HELP OUR STUDENTS THINGS LIKE. OF GREATER- ENHANCED OF. TECHNOLOGY TECHNOLOGICAL TOOLS- THAT STUDENTS COULD ACCESS TO THEIR PHONES TO FIND OUT SOME IMMEDIATE MENTAL HEALTH. HELP OF WE COULD PRINT OF PREVENTIVE MATERIALS. AND HOLD DIFFERENT KINDS OF CLASSES FOR STUDENTS TO- GIVE THEM SOME TOOLS ON HOW TO COPE WITH STRESS. OUR ANALYSIS REFERS TO A- DISCUSSION ITEM AT A AT A REGENTS MEETING HAVING TO DO WITH YOU SEE COLLABORATION WITH COUNTIES TO ENHANCE STUDENT AND COMMUNITY HEALTH I ASSUME. THIS ALL THIS IN PART RELATES TO THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT PROP SIXTY THREE AND THE MONEY THAT COUNTIES- RECEIVED TO PROVIDE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES TO THOSE WITHIN THE COUNTY. DO YOU DO YOU HAVE ANY STATUS REPORT OR ANY PROGRESS REPORT ON THOSE DISCUSSIONS- I'M SORRY I DO NOT I DON'T. I DON'T HAVE A STATUS REPORT ON THAT I DO KNOW THAT. THE UNIVERSITY HAS IN THE PAST RECEIVED SOME OF PROP SIXTY THREE FUNDS- WE RECEIVED AN EIGHT MILLION DOLLAR GRANT. OF THAT ENDED IN TWENTY FOURTEEN SO WE SPENT OVER SEVERAL YEARS AND THEN WE STARTED OUR OWN- PROGRAM TO- PUT ADDITIONAL STUDENT SERVICES PLEASE. TOWARD STUDENT MENTAL HEALTH EFFORTS. OKAY. OKAY I DID NOT- I NEGLECTED TO GIVE YOU AN OPPORTUNITY TO. AVOID COMMENTS IF YOU IF YOU HAVE ANY TO PROVIDE ON. RAPID RE HOUSING FOOD AND SECURITY THAT ISSUE WHICH WAS NUMBER SIX AND OF COURSE THIS ISSUE NUMBER SEVEN HAVING TO DO WITH STUDENT MENTAL HEALTH. NO SPECIFIC COMMENTS HAPPY TO WORK WITH THE COMMITTEE AS IT LOOKS OF THESE ISSUES MORE. ISSUE A PROCEDURE HELP ON THIS. I HAVE NO WERE OTHER QUESTIONS MA'AM OKAY CAN I JUST MAKE A CLOSING COMMENT AFTER I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT- AT A TIME WHEN THE STATE HAS A MULTI BILLION DOLLAR SURPLUS OF AN INVESTMENT IN THE UC RATE IS VERY. A NEW INVESTMENT IN UC WITH THIS VERY TIMELY AND WARRANTED AND WE ARE REQUESTING TWO HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE MILLION IN ADDITION THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THANK YOU VERY MUCH GOT THAT WILL WORK ON THAT. THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION EXCELLENT JOB. OKAY ISSUE NUMBER EIGHT ANIMAL SHELTER OUT REACH GRANT. A NEW AREA FOR BUDGETS OF ONE. SOMEONE WANTS TO EXPAND MY HORIZONS. THANK YOU SELL JUST OUTLINED THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL IS FOR FIFTY MILLION ONE TIME. FUNDS GENERAL FUND TO BE SPENT OVER A PERIOD OF FIVE YEARS FOR. A GRANT PROGRAM AND OUTREACH ACTIVITIES THAT THE UC DAVIS CORPS AT SHELTER MEDICINE PROGRAM- WOULD MINISTER AND SO TODAY WE HAVE DOCTOR KATE HURLEY HERE HIS THE DIRECTOR OF THE COURT MEDICINE PROGRAM. ARE THE COURT SHELTER MEDICINE PROGRAM WHICH IT SHOULD BE NOTED WAS THE FIRST OF ITS KIND IN THE WORLD- WHEN IT WAS FOUNDED IN IT STILLS LEADING THE WAY IN THINKING ABOUT HOW TO MANAGE ELMO SHELTERS. LET ME AS ONE JUST OVER ARCHING QUESTION THAT DOESN'T NEED TO BE ADDRESSED RIGHT NOW. IT JUST OCCURRED TO ME AS I WAS READING THE MATERIAL- WITH RESPECT TO THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE. THAT WAS PROPOSED OR ASSESSMENTS AND PROSPEROUS SPECIFIC PROJECTS WITH FILTERS- EDUCATIONAL AND OTHERWISE OUT REACH. AND I GUESS MY QUESTION IS. MS LOGAN DO WITH THE AMOUNT OF THE APPROPRIATION BUT WHY NOT ALLOCATE THE MONEY ON AN ANNUAL BASIS WHEN THE MONEY IS PROPOSED TO BE USED FOR ASSESSMENTS AND PROJECTS AN OUT REACH RATHER THAN YOU KNOW HIRING PERSONNEL AND DOING THE KIND OF THINGS WERE YOU WOULD NEED TO. A AN APPROPRIATION OVER A PERIOD OF TIME IN ORDER TO MAKE THE WHOLE. ASSESS WORK IS THAT A FAIR QUESTION. IT'S A FAIR QUESTION WE CAN JUST SAY THAT THE ADMINISTRATION'S PERSPECTIVE IS THAT THE RESOURCES THIS YEAR. ARE SUCH THAT FIFTY MILLION IS A GOOD AMOUNT TO MAKE A SERIOUS COMMITMENT TO ADDRESSING I'VE DID FAIL TO NOTE THAT THE POLICY GOAL HERE IS. ON THE BOOKS THE STATE HAS A POLICY GOAL OF NOTE TREATABLE OR ADOPTABLE DOGS OR CATS BEING EUTHANIZED. AND PROVIDING FIFTY MILLION. IS GOING TO. BE A GIANT LEAP FORWARD IN TRYING TO ACHIEVE THAT EXISTING POLICY GOAL. IN TERMS OF HOW THE MONEY WOULD BE SPENT OVER A PERIOD OF TIME AND WHY- IT'S ACTUALLY GOING TO HAVE ON GOING IMPLICATIONS EVEN THOUGH IT'S- A SHORT TERM I THINK. DR HURLEY HAS A COUPLE MINUTES HIGH LEVEL OVERVIEW OF. THE PROGRAM THAT MIGHT BE HELPFUL AND THEN SHE- THAT SHE COULD ANSWER MORE DETAIL LEVEL QUESTIONS BUT I GUESS THE OTHER THING IS THE RESPONSE TO MY QUESTION IS WE CAN DEAL WITH THAT THROUGH AN ANNUAL REPORTING REQUIREMENTS SO WE KEEP. TABS ON HOW THE MONEY IS USED TO. ON ANNUAL BASIS AS OPPOSED TO HAVING PEOPLE COME BACK IN AND- IN A WITH THEIR HAND OUT I UNDERSTAND THAT. WILL LOVE TO TALK ABOUT IF A REPORTING REQUIREMENT MAKES SENSE AND- WITH BUDGET STAFF ON THIS PARTICULAR ONE DR. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US THANK YOU SO MUCH AND GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR- I AM CAIT HURLEY I AM PROUD TO LEAD THE CORRECTIONAL TO MEDICINE PROGRAM AT THE UC DAVIS SCHOOL. OF VETERINARY MEDICINE. AND I'D LIKE TO THANK GOVERNOR NEWSOME FOR PUTTING FOR THIS COMPASSIONATE PROPOSAL. TO REALIZE OUR STATE'S GOAL FROM NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT THAT NO HEALTHIER TREATABLE AND WILL BE IS THE NIGHT IN A SHELTER. AND FOR ENTRUSTING OUR PROGRAM WITH THE TASK OF MAKING IT A REALITY AS MENTIONED WE WERE THE FIRST PROGRAM IN THE WORLD OF OUR KIND. AND WE'RE AT THE LEADING VETERINARY SKIP SCHOOL IN THE WORLD AND SO I THOUGHT. PERCENT CONFIDENT WE CAN DELIVER ON THAT TRUST. AS A STATE. MADE UP OF PROGRESS SINCE POLICY GO. WAS STAB. HOWEVER OVER SEVEN HUNDRED. DOGS AND CATS STILL ENTER OUR STATE SHELTERS ON AN ANNUAL BASIS. AND ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED OF THOSE ANIMALS STILL LOSE THEIR LIVES AND OUR SHELTERS EVERY SINGLE DAY. AND WE KNOW THAT THERE'S A DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACT OF THAT BURDEN ON ECONOMICALLY CHALLENGED COMMUNITIES. UP AND DOWN CALIFORNIA. AND GIVENWHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF THE RELATIONSHIP OF HUMAN BEINGS AND ANIMALS. FOR HUMAN PHYSICAL MENTAL HEALTH WELL AS FOR THE ANIMALS CELLS THIS SHOULD BE SEEN AS A HUMAN HEALTH CONCERN. WELL AND- WE HAVE A SOLUTION. WE RECOGNIZE THAT THE ONGOING USE AN EXTRA OF HEALTHY UNTREATABLE ANIMALS IN SHELTERS REFLECTS A LACK OF ACCESS TO KNOWLEDGE AND TRAINING. AS MUCH AS A LACK OF FINANCIAL RESOURCES. IN SOLVING THE FINANCIAL GAP WITHOUT SOLVING THE KNOWLEDGE GAP WOULD BE INEFFICIENT AT BEST. AN UNSUSTAINABLE IN THE LONG TERM AND THERE ARE A LOT OF FOR SHELTERS IN OUR COMMUNITY DON'T HAVE THE FUNDS TO EVEN SEND SOMEBODY TO A TRAINING PROGRAM. LET ALONE ACCESS AN EXPERT CONSULTANT TO COME IN AND ASSESS THEIR OPERATIONS. AND SO THIS IS CONCEIVED AS A TWO PART PROGRAM REALLY TO ADDRESS THAT ISSUE. ABOUT 25% OF THE FUNDING WOULD GO TO THE SHELTER MEDICINES PROGRAM OUT REGION TRAINING SERVICES. AND WE WOULD PROVIDE ONLINE COURSES THAT WOULD BE EASILY ACCESSIBLE AND REGIONAL AND STATEWIDE CONFERENCES MAYBE VIRTUAL- ACCESSIBLE TO EVERY SINGLE CALIFORNIA SHELTER. WE WOULD ALSO PROVIDE TARGETED IN DEPTH ASSESSMENT FOR AT LEAST A HUNDRED SHELTERS OF ABOUT THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY IN CALIFORNIA WITH THE GREATEST IDENTIFIED NEED. AND THEN THE REMAINING 75% OF THAT FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS WOULD GO DIRECTLY TO GRANTS TO THE SHELTERS. SO THE WAY WE ANTICIPATE WOULD THIS WOULD WORK IS THAT THE GRANT PROGRAM WOULD BE LINKED. TO THE OUTRAGE AND TRAIN SERVICES CLOSELY SOCIAL JUST COULD APPLY INITIALLY. FOR THE ASSESSMENT PROCESS. AND THEN IN THAT PROCESS WE WOULD WORK TOGETHER TO IDENTIFYING THE AREAS OF GREATEST IMPACT. AND WE WOULD INVITE GRANT APPLICATIONS TO IMPLEMENT THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS. RATHER THAN LEAVING IT TO CASH STRAPPED SHELTERS WITH SMALL STAFF STAFF TO FIGURE OUT FOR THEMSELVES WHAT ARE THE MOST LEVERAGE CHANGES THAT THEY COULD MAKE. SO ESSENTIALLY THE ASSESSMENT PROCESS WE DEVELOPED AS WE ENVISION IT WOULD PARALLEL THE PHYSICAL EXAM THAT WE PERFORM ON INDIVIDUAL PASS. THAT'S AND THEN THE GRANT PROGRAM WOULD ALLOW US TO PULL OUT OUR VIRTUAL PRESCRIPTION PAD TO ALLOW THE SHELTER TO ACTUALLY IMPLEMENT THE RECOMMENDATIONS. THAT WE ANTICIPATE WOULD DELIVER LONG TERM LIFESAVING IMPACT FOR A ONE TIME INVESTMENT AND I'M HAPPY TO IMAGINE THAT A ONE TIME INFUSION OF FUNDS COULD DELIVER LONG TERM CHANGES. I LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING HOW YOU ROLL THIS OUT AND WILL PROBABLY FIGURE OUT SOME SORT OF REPORTING. NINE OWNERS REPORTING ACTUATION SO THAT NOTHING LESS THAN OF COURSE WE WOULD ANTICIPATE WILL MOST WANT TO TRASH THE IMPACT. OF OUR WORK CLOSELY AS WELL MOST OF THE STUFF WE DO IS ON BUT WILL GOING TO MAKE WHEN. I REALLY FOR THAT. FINANCE EXCUSE ME JUST HERE POINT ABOUT REPORTING REQUIREMENTS ON THE PROGRAM I'D MENTION OF THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE FOR THIS PROPOSAL CURRENTLY PROPOSES THAT TWO YEAR BI ANNUAL REPORTING REQUIREMENT- THAT GOES THROUGH MARCH THIRTY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY EIGHT AND AS CURRENTLY WRITTEN THAT WOULD REQUIRE THE SHELTER MEDICINE PROGRAMMING YOU SEE TO REPORT THE PROGRAMMATIC AND FINANCIAL INFORMATION RESULTING FROM THE PROGRAM OVER THE PRECEDING TWO YEARS. AND THAT'S PROBABLY THE RIGHT. TIMING AS WELL GIVEN THE FACT YOU NEED TO ROLL THE MONEY OUT AND YOU NEED TO FIGURE REPORT YOU WANT US. HAVE SOME RESULTS TO REPORT SO THAT MAKES SENSE. I DID NOTE THAT BUT I'D FORGOTTEN IT'S THANKS FOR THANKS FOR REMINDING ME. LA ANY COMMENT. JUST EMISSIONS FOR CONSIDERATION WE THINK THERE'S KIND OF A BROADER ISSUE TO CONSIDER AND THEN WE HAVE SOME SPECIFIC COMMENTS ON THE PROGRAM TO ON THE PROPOSAL I'M SORRY LEVEL COMMENT IS- JUST RATE FOR SKINNER CONSIDERATION OF THE VARIOUS ONE TIME PRIORITIES- YOU MIGHT BE FACING IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET PREVIOUS BUDGETS HAVE PROVIDED A NOTABLE OUT ARE FOCUSED AT LEAST A LOT OF ONE TIME FUNDING ON ADDRESSING. EXISTING LIABILITIES AT HE STATE'S EDUCATION SEGMENTS FOCUSED ON THINGS LIKE PAYING DOWN UNFUNDED LIABILITIES DRESSING DEFERRED MAINTENANCE WITH WITH THESE KINDS OF ONE TIME- SPENDING YOU HAVE A LOT OF YOU HAVE A GREATER UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT WHAT YOU'RE ACCOMPLISHING ON THE IS EITHER A RESULTING MORE STATE SAVINGS OR PROVIDING FISCAL RELIEF TO EDUCATION AGENCIES FOR EXAMPLE. ON BY CONTRAST FOR THE PROPOSAL THERE'S A LITTLE BIT MORE UNCERTAINTY ABOUT WHAT MIGHT BE ACCOMPLISHMENTS THAT'S BECAUSE THE MILESTONES PLACE ON ALTHOUGH. THE ONE TIME THERE'S A LOT MORE CERTAIN KEY WITH PROPOSAL SOMETHING YOU WANT WHICH YOU CAN WEARING AS- WAY OLIVER ONE TIME PRIORITY. I'M I ALSO THAT THAT MESSAGE IS. YOU'LL BE HEARING A BIT FROM US THIS YEAR THE GOVERNOR HAS NUMEROUS ONE TIME PROPOSAL EDUCATION. BY THE WATER PRIORITIES BUT SPENT SPREAD ARGUABLY SPREADS RESOURCES MORE THINLY NOT TURNED OF APPROACH IS TO IDENTIFY SOME OF THE HIGHEST PRIORITIES AND DIRECT ONE TIME FUNDING TOWARDS IS REALLY HIGH PRIORITIES MIGHT HAVE A BIGGER IMPACT. I'M IN TERMS O A SOME SPECIFIC COMMENTS WE HAVE ON THIS PROPOSAL A LOT OF THE ISSUES- THAT YOU JUST RAISED- WE THINK WOULD MAKE SENSE TO HAVE A MORE DETAILED IN. A MOVE BUDGET PLAN NOT PRIOR APPROPRIATING FUNDS- ON THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE PROGRAM HAVE PROVIDED A LITTLE BIT MORE CLARITY AS TO THE BREAK OUT OF WHAT PORTION WOULD BE FOR ADMINISTRATION PORTION BE FOR GRANTS. IT'S A LITTLE MORE FINANCIAL INFORMATION LIKE COME STAFFING WOULD BE HIRED THE- SLARY COST THINGS LIKE THAT WOULD BE A WE THINK WOULD BE APPROPRIATE PROTECT. PARTICULARLY BECAUSE THIS. APPROPRIATION IS A SO SIGNIFICANT- RELATIVE TO THE PROGRAMS EXISTING BUDGET- WE ALSO NOTE THAT THERE THERE COULD BE SOME RISKS- A FROWN DEEPENED COST PRESSURES DEPENDING ON HOW THE PROGRAM SPENDS THE FUN. OF A LOT OF FLEXIBILITY OF MEANT- ON SKIP. THAT IN MY IF YOU'RE WAITING PROPOSED. I'M IN FINALLY HAD CONCERNS WITH THE REPORTING LANGUAGE WITH COULD BE. HAPPY TO WORK WITH STAFF ADMINISTRATION OFTEN. UP AND STRENGTHENS WERE PART IN SOME THAT THE WHAT. IN SESSION IT NEEDS. TO WHETHER THE PROGRAM- BUT ACHIEVES THE OBJECTIVES OF REDUCING ANIMAL- IS INNOVATION. WELL ABSOLUTE. AND ACTUALLY. WE'RE GONNA STICK TO BY IT ALL A REPORT QUORUM. SHOULD AND SO YOU HAVE TWO YEARS THIS ULTRA. I WOULD HOPE THAT AT THE END THERE'S SOMEONE OUT OF THE PRO WAS THE TO DO WITH THE RESULTS ARE AND THEN TAKE A LOOK AT WHETHER THE PROGRAM SHOULD BE RE DIRECTED IN ANY WAY TO HAVE MORE IMPACT TO BE MORE EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT AND THAT SHOULD BE DOCUMENTED IN THE REPORT THAT WE GET. HOPEFULLY IN ADVANCE SO THAT WE CAN HAVE A CONVERSATION- IN WHATEVER BUDGET YEAR THAT HAPPENS TO BE IN. A MONIES ALREADY APPROPRIATED BUT WE CAN STILL HAVE A CONVERSATION. AND I WOULD APPRECIATE. SIR YOUR YOUR INVOLVEMENT IN THAT PROCESS. IT CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THE INTEREST IN AND- LOOK FOR THE ONGOING COVERS IT IS A UNIQUE ISSUE FOR BUDGETS OF ONE I'M EXCITED TO PARTICIPATE. ANYTHING ELSE.

ON SOME OF THE THINGS THAT ARE INCLUDED IN THIS. BUDGET PROPOSAL ARE THE EXACT SAME THINGS THAT THEY CAME TO OUR SHELTER IN PROVIDED US. ON IT IS BEEN PROVEN THAT THESE BASIC- PROGRAMS THAT THEY CAN PROVIDE TO THE SHELTERS HAVE DRASTIC EFFECTS ON IMPROVING THE OUTCOMES OF ANIMALS. AND ALSO INCREASES THE PUBLIC SUPPORT- IN THE LOCAL AREAS AND ALSO BRINGS ATTENTION TO THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS. ON THE NEEDS IN THE- PROGRAMS SHELTERS ARE ARE REQUIRED. TO PROVIDE- IN STOCKTON A BECAUSE OF THE PROGRAMS THAT UC DAVIS SHELTER CREDIT PROGRAM HIM IN AN ASSISTED US WITH WE WERE ABLE TO RAISE OUR LIVE RELEASE RATE FROM 32% TO EIGHTY THREE PERCENT- IN A PERIOD OF LESS THAN FIVE YEARS.
