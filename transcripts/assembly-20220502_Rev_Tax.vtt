SENATE SPECIALIZED THEY

00:50:13.710 --> 00:50:15.746
CERTAINLY DO YOU KNOW IF YOU

00:50:15.812 --> 00:50:17.748
LOOK AT- MANY OF THE OTHER FIRST

00:50:17.814 --> 00:50:19.216
WORLD COUNTRIES IN EUROPE THAT

00:50:19.282 --> 00:50:21.084
WE COMPETE WITH THEY HAVE VALUE

00:50:21.151 --> 00:50:24.287
ADDED TAXES AND- IT IS THE WAY

00:50:24.354 --> 00:50:25.756
THE WAY THAT THEY HAVE BEEN ABLE

00:50:25.822 --> 00:50:28.625

00:50:28.692 --> 00:50:32.062

00:50:32.129 --> 00:50:33.630
THINK WHEN YOU HAVE THE RIGHT

00:50:33.697 --> 00:50:35.799
INVESTMENTS AND I DON'T THINK

00:50:35.866 --> 00:50:37.768
ANYBODY WOULD SUGGEST THAT. THE

00:50:37.834 --> 00:50:41.538
EUROPE IS- MORE ENGAGED IN AND

00:50:41.605 --> 00:50:43.740
THAT SORT OF NOT TAKING CARE OF

00:50:43.807 --> 00:50:45.375
THE LOW INCOME PEOPLE THAT

00:50:45.442 --> 00:50:46.309
YOU'RE REFERRING TO WHAT'S

00:50:46.376 --> 00:50:47.911
REGRESSIVE TAXES- THANKS I

00:50:47.978 --> 00:50:49.579
CERTAINLY THINK THEY FOUND A WAY

00:50:49.646 --> 00:50:50.947
TO MAKE SURE THAT THE

00:50:51.014 --> 00:50:51.581
INVESTMENTS ARE REALLY

00:50:51.648 --> 00:50:53.683
APPROPRIATE INVESTMENTS AND THIS

00:50:53.750 --> 00:50:55.585
IS AS APPROPRIATE ON THE BEST

00:50:55.652 --> 00:50:57.721
MAN AS YOU CAN GET. IT HELPS

00:50:57.788 --> 00:51:00.090
EVERYBODY IN THE COMMUNITY-

00:51:00.157 --> 00:51:02.392
BECAUSE WE ARE ON A COUNTY CLOSE

00:51:02.459 --> 00:51:04.461
TO LOS ANGELES THAT DOES IS NOT

00:51:04.528 --> 00:51:06.263
A SELF HELP COUNTY AND I WOULD

00:51:06.329 --> 00:51:10.600
OFFER. TO DO TWO THINGS ONE.

00:51:10.667 --> 00:51:11.768
WHEN GOVERNMENT WORKS BEST WHEN

00:51:11.835 --> 00:51:13.236
IT HELPS PEOPLE HELP THEMSELVES

00:51:13.303 --> 00:51:15.172
THIS IS GOING TO LET PEOPLE. AS

00:51:15.238 --> 00:51:16.873
GONNA BURKE IS GONNA LET PEOPLE

00:51:16.940 --> 00:51:18.475
DECIDE IF THEY WANT TO HELP

00:51:18.542 --> 00:51:20.877
THEMSELVES AND THEN ALL WE'RE

00:51:20.944 --> 00:51:21.745
DOING IS JUST TRYING TO SAY

00:51:21.812 --> 00:51:23.613
OKAY. IF YOU'RE WILLING TO DO IT

00:51:23.680 --> 00:51:26.349
THAT I LOVE THESE OPPORTUNITIES-

00:51:26.416 --> 00:51:28.151
SAME THINGS HAPPENED WHEN WE HAD

00:51:28.218 --> 00:51:32.389
A- A LOCAL TAX TO BUY A SCHOOL.

00:51:32.456 --> 00:51:33.623
FOR A LOCAL LOW INCOME

00:51:33.690 --> 00:51:36.460
COMMUNITY. AND IT WAS A THAT WAS

00:51:36.526 --> 00:51:38.428
A TAX TO PURCHASE SCHOOL THEY

00:51:38.495 --> 00:51:40.630
VOTED FOR IT AND WE CAN HELP

00:51:40.697 --> 00:51:42.666
THEM BECAUSE THEY VOTED TO TAX

00:51:42.732 --> 00:51:44.167
THEMSELVES. THAT'S THE SAME

00:51:44.234 --> 00:51:46.136
THING THAT I THINK IS HAPPENING

00:51:46.203 --> 00:51:46.736
HERE. THE OTHER THING THAT I

00:51:46.803 --> 00:51:48.638
JUST WHILE I HAVE THE FLOOR HERE

00:51:48.705 --> 00:51:50.707
FOR YOU IF YOU DON'T MIND ME

00:51:50.774 --> 00:51:52.976
POINTING OUT IS THAT IS THAT.

00:51:53.043 --> 00:51:54.444
THERE ARE VERY FEW THINGS THAT

00:51:54.511 --> 00:51:55.045
WE GET BIPARTISAN SUPPORT ON

00:51:55.111 --> 00:51:57.013
ANYMORE IN THIS COUNTRY. AND WE

00:51:57.080 --> 00:51:58.682
COME TO YOU WITH BIPARTISAN

00:51:58.748 --> 00:52:00.851
SUPPORT FROM THE VENTURA COUNTY

00:52:00.917 --> 00:52:04.221
BOARD OF SUPERVISORS- AND IF I

00:52:04.287 --> 00:52:06.256
THINK PART OF WHY WE HAVE THAT

00:52:06.323 --> 00:52:07.324
BIPARTISAN SUPPORT IS BECAUSE

00:52:07.390 --> 00:52:08.391
WE'RE HELPING PEOPLE HELP

00:52:08.458 --> 00:52:10.293
THEMSELVES WERE SAYING TO THEM.

00:52:10.360 --> 00:52:11.895
IF YOU WANT TO DO IT IF YOU WANT

00:52:11.962 --> 00:52:14.097
TO DO THE WORK ROLL UP YOUR

00:52:14.164 --> 00:52:15.432
SLEEVES TAX YOURSELF AND DO ALL

00:52:15.499 --> 00:52:17.000
THAT MAKE SURE THE MONEY IS

00:52:17.067 --> 00:52:18.535
SPENT WILL. WILL HELP YOU BY

00:52:18.602 --> 00:52:20.837
GETTING OUT OF THE WAY THEY HAVE

00:52:20.904 --> 00:52:21.705
A THEY HAVE A TECHNICAL PROBLEM

00:52:21.771 --> 00:52:22.672
NUMBER TRAVIS ALL THE TECHNICAL

00:52:22.739 --> 00:52:25.208
PROBLEMS THANK YOU FOR YOUR

00:52:25.275 --> 00:52:27.210
QUESTION I APPRECIATE. SO LIKE I

00:52:27.277 --> 00:52:28.378
JUST WANT TO FOLLOW UP ON THAT

00:52:28.445 --> 00:52:29.779
AND REPEAT AGAIN FOR I THINK THE

00:52:29.846 --> 00:52:32.148
FIFTH TIME THAT THIS IS NOT

00:52:32.215 --> 00:52:33.116
RAISING TAXES THIS IS GIVING THE

00:52:33.183 --> 00:52:35.352
ABILITY OF INTER COUNTY TO. OF

00:52:35.418 --> 00:52:37.420
TO RAISE TAXES AND THIS IS WE

00:52:37.487 --> 00:52:39.523
HAVE KIND OF A UNIQUE SITUATION.

00:52:39.589 --> 00:52:42.359
THERE ARE PROBABLY. FOUR OR FIVE

00:52:42.425 --> 00:52:43.994
CITIES THAT HAVE NEVER RAISE

00:52:44.060 --> 00:52:46.062
THEIR TAX SO THEY ARE AT THE

00:52:46.129 --> 00:52:47.931
VERY LOWEST LEVEL IN THE STATE.

00:52:47.998 --> 00:52:50.500
SO THERE'S IT JUST HAPPENS THAT

00:52:50.567 --> 00:52:52.068
ONE CITY IS THE ONE THAT'S

00:52:52.135 --> 00:52:53.670
THAT'S AT THE LIMIT THAT IS KIND

01:07:15.097 --> 01:07:17.433
WITH THE GOVERNMENT DOLLARS.

01:07:17.500 --> 01:07:19.535
DOES IT REALLY MAKE SENSE TO

A ESTABLISH PROGRAM OR MORE

01:07:26.208 --> 01:07:28.043
ROBUSTLY SUPPORTING ONE OF THE

01:07:28.110 --> 01:07:30.546
ESTABLISH PROGRAMS. I THINK FOR

01:07:30.613 --> 01:07:32.481
US IN OUR AGENCIES IN THE

01:07:32.548 --> 01:07:34.016
FAMILIES WE SERVE. IT DEPENDS ON

01:07:34.083 --> 01:07:35.718
SPECIFICALLY WHAT PROGRAM WE MAY

01:07:35.785 --> 01:07:37.520
BE DISCUSSING ONE OF THE ISSUES

01:07:37.586 --> 01:07:39.488
THAT WE CONSTANTLY SEE IN OUR IN

01:07:39.555 --> 01:07:39.955
OUR NEIGHBORHOODS AND

01:07:40.022 --> 01:07:40.790
COMMUNITIES. BECAUSE WE HAVE

01:07:40.856 --> 01:07:43.159
UNITS THAT ARE BUILT AND THEY'RE

01:07:43.225 --> 01:07:44.693
BUILT WITH INCENTIVIZE PROGRAMS

01:07:44.760 --> 01:07:46.662
RIGHT FOR LOW INCOME FAMILIES.

01:07:46.729 --> 01:07:48.097
IN THOSE UNITS SIT VACANT

01:07:48.164 --> 01:07:48.964
BECAUSE THERE'S NO DIRECT

01:07:49.031 --> 01:07:50.900
CORRELATION THERE'S NO. THERE'S

01:07:50.966 --> 01:07:52.701
NO ABILITY TO TRACK WHETHER AN

01:07:52.768 --> 01:07:54.570
ACTUAL FAMILIES IN THOSE UNITS

01:07:54.637 --> 01:07:56.739
AND I THINK WITH THIS TAX CREDIT

01:07:56.806 --> 01:07:57.807
IN THE WAY IT'S WRITTEN IS

01:07:57.873 --> 01:07:59.642
ALLOWS US TO SAY. WE ENSURE THAT

01:07:59.708 --> 01:08:00.910
THERE'S A FAMILY IN THAT PLACE

01:08:00.976 --> 01:08:02.978
BECAUSE THEY'RE GONNA HAVE TO

01:08:03.045 --> 01:08:03.646
SHOW THAT THAT FAMILIES IN THAT

01:08:03.712 --> 01:08:05.347
IN THAT LOCATION. AND THAT'S

01:08:05.414 --> 01:08:06.782
SOMETHING THAT THAT WE SEE ON

01:08:06.849 --> 01:08:08.784
THE GROUND EVERY DAY AND THAT'S

01:08:08.851 --> 01:08:09.919
WHAT THE BIGGEST CONCERNS WE

01:08:09.985 --> 01:08:13.255
HAVE. THAT'S NOT THE CASE WITH

01:08:13.322 --> 01:08:15.157
OTHER TAX YOU'RE YOU'RE SAYING

01:08:15.224 --> 01:08:17.126
IF THE- IF DEVELOPERS ARE USING

01:08:17.193 --> 01:08:20.262
OTHER TYPES OF. TAX CREDITS THAN

01:08:20.329 --> 01:08:21.197
THE UNITS ARE OFTEN SITTING

01:08:21.263 --> 01:08:24.166
EMPTY. CORRECT WE SEE THAT QUITE

01:08:24.233 --> 01:08:25.935
A BIT IS THE ISSUE IS THAT.

01:08:26.001 --> 01:08:27.803
UNITS WILL END UP BEING LONG

01:08:27.870 --> 01:08:30.806
TERM INDIANS NOT ACCESSIBLE- AND

01:08:30.873 --> 01:08:32.475
THEY SHOULD BE HAVE ACCESS TO

01:08:32.541 --> 01:08:33.442
LOW INCOME PEOPLE THAT'S JUST

01:08:33.509 --> 01:08:35.077
SOMETHING WE SEE ON A COST

01:08:35.144 --> 01:08:38.180
BASIS. AS A CONCERN FOR A LOT OF

01:08:38.247 --> 01:08:38.814
FAMILIES THAT WE SERVE- ARE NOT

01:08:38.881 --> 01:08:40.382
NECESSARILY ALLOWED TO COME INTO

01:08:40.449 --> 01:08:41.884
THOSE UNITS FOR DIFFERENT

01:08:41.951 --> 01:08:42.885
REASONS YOU KNOW MAYBE A LOT OF

01:08:42.952 --> 01:08:45.054
THE FAMILIES WE SERVE HAVE HAVE

01:08:45.120 --> 01:08:46.155
MULTI. GENERATIONAL FAMILIES IN

01:08:46.222 --> 01:08:47.957
ONE PLACE THEY DON'T GET ACCESS

01:08:48.023 --> 01:08:49.391
TO THOSE THINGS AND THAT'S VERY

01:08:49.458 --> 01:08:51.494
VERY DIFFICULT FOR US TO

01:08:51.560 --> 01:08:54.830
CONTINUE TO DO OUR WORK. OKAY

THE GALLON BUT- IF THIS ARE BILL

01:11:40.529 --> 01:11:43.399

PEOPLE BACK I DON'T KNOW WHAT

01:11:45.567 --> 01:11:48.203
THE BEST WAY TO DO THAT IS IT

01:11:48.270 --> 01:11:50.105
COULD BE JUST TO. IN L.

01:11:50.172 --> 01:11:52.741
APPROXIMATE. I DON'T KNOW IF

TALKING ABOUT I IN A WAY THAT

01:12:02.785 --> 01:12:04.887

MAYBE CERTAIN AMOUNT PER

01:12:11.960 --> 01:12:14.329
EMPLOYEE. WHATEVER I THINK THIS

01:12:14.396 --> 01:12:16.899
WOULD BE FEASIBLE IF WE COULD.

01:12:16.965 --> 01:12:18.767

01:12:28.143 --> 01:12:30.679
MY UNDERSTANDING AND THE

01:12:30.746 --> 01:12:32.881

THAT BEGAN IF ANYBODY'S ABOVE

01:12:34.950 --> 01:12:36.819
AGAIN LIMIT WOULD HAVE THE BROAD

01:12:36.885 --> 01:12:37.786
BASED ACTUALLY IF THIS IS A VERY

01:12:37.853 --> 01:12:40.489
TARGETED TAX CREDIT- AT THAT IS

01:12:40.556 --> 01:12:42.191
TO SPEAK TO FILL A SPECIFIC GAP

01:12:42.257 --> 01:12:44.526
THAT WAS CREATED- WENDY

01:12:44.593 --> 01:12:45.994
ADDITIONAL SICK PAY LEAVE A

01:12:46.061 --> 01:12:48.030
PROPOSAL WAS PUT INTO PLACE. BUT

01:12:48.097 --> 01:12:49.465
WHEN THE ORIGINAL SICK PAY LEAVE

01:12:49.531 --> 01:12:51.734
PROPOSAL WAS PASSED- AT THE BAD

01:12:51.800 --> 01:12:53.802
DURING THE PANDEMIC- THERE WAS A

01:12:53.869 --> 01:12:55.571
FEDERAL TAX CREDIT IN PLACE THAT

01:12:55.637 --> 01:12:57.172
ALLOWED SMALL BUSINESSES AND

01:12:57.239 --> 01:13:00.275
NONPROFITS- TO TAKE IT TO OFFSET

01:13:00.342 --> 01:13:02.144

01:13:04.146 --> 01:13:06.014
LAW THAT FEDERAL TAX RATE HAD

01:13:06.081 --> 01:13:08.550
EXPIRED. SO NOW THAT THE SMALL

01:13:08.617 --> 01:13:10.452
BUSINESSES AND NONPROFITS IN OUR

01:13:10.519 --> 01:13:12.287
