PLEASE FEEL FREE TO BEGIN WHEN YOU'RE READY. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS- I WOULD LIKE TO START BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEES PROPOSED TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS AND THANKING THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR THOROUGH EVALUATION OF THIS LARGEST CHEN. AB EIGHTEEN FORTY FIVE ESTABLISHES THE OFFICE TO END HOMELESSNESS WHICH WILL BE HOUSED IN THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE THE OFFICE WILL BE OVERSEEN BY A NEW SECRETARY ON HOMELESSNESS THIS NEW SECRETARY WILL BE IN CHARGE OF OVER OVERSEEING ALL STATE HOMELESSNESS PROGRAMS. THAT WOULD CONTINUE TO BE MANAGED BY EXISTING ENTITIES. IN ASSEMBLY APPROPRIATIONS I TOOK AMENDMENTS THAT REMOVED ANY COST PRESSURES ASSOCIATED WITH THE MEASURE BY TRANSFERRING EXISTING STAFF AND RESOURCES TO THE OFFICE TO THE NEW OFFICE TO END HOMELESSNESS- FOR CONTEXT I SHOULD POINT OUT THAT WE HAVE ADDED MORE AND MORE LAYERS OF NEW POLICIES OVER SEVERAL DECADES. TO COMBAT THE INCREASING. HOMELESSNESS EPIDEMIC AT THIS POINT THERE ARE AT LEAST THIRTEEN DIFFERENT STATE AGENCIES AND DEPARTMENTS ADMINISTERING. OVER THIRTY DIFFERENT PROGRAMS RELATED TO HELP ASSESS WELL WELL IN. WE HAVE CREATED A THAT IS FRAGMENTED OFTEN WITH CONFLICTING GOALS THAT PLEASE REFER IN A- RESPONSE AT THE STATE LEVEL. THE RECOMMENDATION HAS WELL DONE. OVER THE- IN NINETEEN A NINE LITTLE WHO BURKE. RECOMMEND UNIT ALL HOME. STATE PROGRAMS INTO ONE ENTITY GRAMS THEN TOOK IT. OKAY A THREE DAY THE TECH LATER IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE STATE AUDITOR REPORTED THE CORE REASON OUR UNSHELTERED HOMELESS POPULATION EXCEEDS THAT OF OTHER STATES IS DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE OTHER STATES HAVE A SINGLE ENTITY CHARGED SPECIFICALLY WITH ADDRESSING HOMELESSNESS. THE GOVERNOR'S OWN TASK FORCE EVEN CALLED FOR A SINGLE OFFICE ON HOMELESSNESS. RECENTLY THAT LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE ISSUED A REPORT HIGHLIGHTING THE VARIOUS CHALLENGES THAT THE STATE MUST OVERCOME TO RESOLVE OUR EXISTING FRAGMENTED RESPONSE TO THIS GROWING CRISIS. SINCE THE START OF COPA NINETEEN SEVEN MILLION INDIVIDUALS HAVE FILED FOR UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS FOR THE FIRST TIME BECAUSE OF THESE JOB LOSSES WE KNOW OUR HOMELESSNESS CRISIS IS ONLY GOING TO GET WORSE. THIS LEGISLATURE AND ADMINISTRATION HAVE DEDICATED SUBSTANTIAL RESOURCES TO COMBAT HOMELESSNESS WHILE STATE FUNDING PLAYS A CRITICAL ROLE FUNDING ALONE WILL NOT SOLVE SYSTEMIC ISSUES IT'S TIME THAT WE FINALLY ADDRESS. OUR STRUCTURAL ISSUES AT THE STATE LEVEL TO END THIS CRISIS TODAY FOR TESTIMONY I HAVE SHARON REPORT DIRECTOR OF CALIFORNIA STATE POLICY FOR THE CORPORATION FOR SUPPORTIVE HOUSING. AND GINNY BELLA- FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST OFFICE WHO'S HERE TO SPEAK- TO THE RECENT FINDINGS ON OUR CURRENT EFFORTSTO COMBAT HOMELESSNESS. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS JENNY BELLOW WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE ARE YOU ABLE TO HEAR ME. YES WE CAN. THANK YOU. WHAT OFFICE NOT TAKE POSITION THAT BILL ON BUILD BECAUSE OF THE WORK WE HAVE DONE RESPONSE THE HOMELESSNESS IS AND HOW RECENTLY WE'VE BEEN ASKED BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER RIVAS TO PROVIDE THEM TECHNICAL WORK WITH RELATE TO EIGHT EIGHTEEN FORTY FIVE. I WILL RIGHT ARE COMMON FROM A READER REPORT HOME OR WE JUST CRIED THE FRIED HE AT THE STATE HOME PROGRAMS AND WE HAVE CHALLENGES. AND YOU'VE ALREADY HEARD TODAY. MULTIPLE STATE BARBARA ARE AND- IN THE ADMINISTRATION PROGRAM THAT AIM ADDRESS. AND CAL. EVEN THE DEPART OF HOUSING COMMUNITY. AT AND THE LOOK AT COURTNEY AND BY COUNCIL ON THE OTHERS. ADDITIONALLY THERE ARE SOME OTHER TO. THAT EITHER ADMINISTERED STATE THEY DO NOT PARK. OR HOW MORE ROLE THAN ADDRESS HOUSE AND HOME AND HOW. AND INCLUDE SUCH AS THE DEPART OF SOCIAL. HOW SERVICES. VETERANS AFFAIRS. THEY CALL AT THIS. APPROACH DOES CREATE CHALLENGES WE THINK THAT THE STATE. FOR EXAMPLE THERE IS TRACKING ALSO RELATED ACROSS STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND ISN'T REALLY BECAUSE THERE'S NOTHING GROUP FOR THAT IN SO IT'S DIFFICULT TO ANSWER QUESTIONS SUCH AS HOW MUCH OF THE STATE SPENDING TO ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS. A IT'S DIFFICULT TO HOW MUCH DATA PLANNING ON ON PURCHASE. APPROACH SO FAR ARE WE SPEND MORE ON THE PREVENTION SIDE WE DOING MORE ON THE INTERVENTION SIDE IN ANSWERING THAT QUESTION A DIFFICULT GIVING THIS FRAGMENTED APPROACH. THERE'S DIFFICULTY DETERMINING HOW MANY PROGRAMS WORK COLLABORATE HOW THE PROGRAM CAN WORK COLLABORATIVELY EACH AND AFFECTING THE PROGRAM HOW THEY COULD BETTER LEVERAGE ONE ANOTHER AND ENSURE THAT. THERE'S NO DUPLICATE EFFORTS. IN ADOPTING HOMELESS. AND FINALLY. IT'S HARD TO A HOW THE STATE DOING. THE HOMEWORK ISSUE ARE WE A COMP BECAUSE OF THE THAT NATURE. WHICH TO IN OUR JANUARY RECORD WE THINK THAT LET. I IT ON. FOR HOMELESSNESS AND CAL. AND THE BILL A PLAN THAT ALLOW WITH PRIORITIES AND THINK THAT YOU CAN. OF THAT WITHIN. THE DEVELOP. OF A STRUCTURE THAT REALLY PRO CLEAR LEADERS. AND GUIDANCE A- THE THAT ARE SET OUT BY THE LEAD. AND WITH THAT BAT QUICKER MY OR WHICH AND HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS. GOOD MORNING. MY NAME IS CHERYL WITH A QUOTE FOR SUPPORT OF. AS MEMBER OF STATE. ARRAYS OF THE RANGE IN OF ON LUNCH NOW FROM THANK YOU AT WELFARE. CHECK IN ON HOW HAS BEEN THAT CAL RESPONSE JOHN IS HIGHLY NAY. INSIDE. AND NO MEANINGFUL COLLABORATION AND ARE HOMELESS HOUSING AND SERVICES PROGRAM. WELCOME HOME OF COORDINATING AND FINANCING COUNCIL WAS INTENDED TO BREAK DOWN THESE SILOS IT HAS NO AUTHORITY OVER OTHER DEPARTMENT OR AGENCY. TO COMPOUND DEPARTMENT DOCTORS SET OF STATE POLICIES AROUND. IN ADDITION TO THE ANTI OXIDANTS PROBLEM MENTIONS THIS RECONCILIATION AND PARKS LOCAL RESPONSE AGENCIES AND NONPROFITS MUST ALSO COMPETE RATHER THAN COOPERATE WITH THEIR JURISDICTIONAL COUNTERPARTS RESPONDS THAT MUST APPLY FOR FUNDING WITH OFTEN CONFLICTING. AND CONTRADICTORY REQUIREMENTS. YES REALITY RATHER THAN ELIMINATE PR. AB EIGHTEEN FORTY FIVE WOULD REDUCE THIS FOR OUR CRISPY BY CREATING A SINGLE AUTHORITY ON HOMELESSNESS ACCOUNTABLE FOR OUTCOMES AND SOLVING HOMELESSNESS AND COORDINATED WAY. WELL THE NATIONAL REGISTRATION OWNERSHIP OVER HOMELESSNESS IS COMMENDABLE EIGHTEEN FORTY FIVE PROPOSES INSTITUTIONALIZING. I'M MORE EFFICIENT BEST THING OF A SINGLE AUTHORITY DIRECTLY ACCORDING TO THE GOVERNOR WITH EXTRA CHEESE OVER HOMELESSNESS AVERAGING AN OFFICE DEDICATED TO A COORDINATED RESPONSE. AT THIS TIME OF THE STATE IS FACING POTENTIAL INCREASES OF HOMELESSNESS OF BETWEEN THIRTY THOUSAND AND A HUNDRED THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS ACCORDING TO SEVERAL- ACADEMICS ALONG WITH THE BUDGET CRISIS NOW IS THE TIME TO MAKE A RESPONSE MORE EFFICIENT. AND MORE EFFECTIVE. AB EIGHTEEN FORTY FIVE WILL NOT REQUIRE THE STATE TO ADD STAFF WORKING TO SOLVE HOMELESSNESS. OR TO CREATE IN THE REGION. HELLO STAFF WORKING FOR THE- HOMELESS CORE AND- COUNCIL TO AN OFFICE ON HOMELESSNESS WITHIN THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE. GIVING OUT STOCK GREATER AUTHORITY OVER THE DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES IMPACT. THE BILL REQUIRES KNOWN AS- AT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE SAID SAID THE LEGISLATURE'S RESPONSIBLE FOR ADOPTING A STATEWIDE PLAN SUGGESTS HOMELESSNESS AND REMEDY THE FRAGMENTED APPROACH.

SO THE MY MAP RIGHT WORD BUT BETTER COORDINATE OUR EFFORTS HERE AT THE STATE AND THEN- WOULD LIKE TO MOVE THE BUILT APPROPRIATE TIME SO THANKS SO MUCH FOR BRAINS BEFORE. THANK YOU THANK YOU CENTER PAN WILL MOVE ON TO SENATOR JOHNSON AND SENATOR JACKSON. I THANK YOU CHAIRMAN. A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS AND MAYBE SOME COMMENTS- YOU MENTIONED IN YOUR OPENING THE GOVERNOR- AND- HAVING THE HOMELESSNESS ARE I THINK IS WHAT HE CALLED IT. HI AND I THINK IT WAS IN EITHER HIS INAUGURAL SPEECH FOR HIS FIRST DAY IN THE STATE. THERE WAS A SAY THE STATE SPEECH HAS FIRST ONE WHEN HE- SAID H WAS GONNA POINT- SENATOR STEINBERG AS THE- STATEWIDE. HOMELESSNESS THESE ARE DO YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO THAT AND WHY WE HAVEN'T SEEN MOVEMENT ON THAT PLAN THAT THE GOVERNOR LAID OUT IN HIS SPEECH. WELL THE GOVERNOR OF APPOINTED I KNOW SENATOR STEINBERG ON A TASK FORCE ON HOMELESSNESS A STATEWIDE TASK FORCE WHICH I BELIEVE SENATOR- CENTER STEINBERG. IS CULTURE. OF AND WE'VE BEEN. WAITING FOR RECOMMENDATIONS WHICH WE HAVE RECEIVED FROM THE TASK FORCE WHICH INCLUDES- WHAT THIS BILL WOULD DO TO CENTRALIZE OUR EFFORTS ON HOMELESSNESS OKAY DO YOU KNOW WHY THE- OKAY APPRECIATE YOUR CREATIVITY AND YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH HERE BUT I MEAN THIS IS A FUNCTION OF THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH. WHY DO WHITE IS THE LEGISLATURE NEED TO HAVE THIS WHITE IS IN THE GOVERNOR JUST DO IT. I THINK AS A LEGISLATURE THIS IS OUR OPPORTUNITY TO ESTABLISH PRIORITIES ON HOMELESSNESS REGARDLESS OF WHO IS IN THE ADMINISTRATION RIGHT WE'RE FORTUNATE THAT OUR GOVERNOR HAS ELEVATED THIS ISSUE- AND YOU KNOW LIKE YOU MENTIONED. A MADE THIS THE SOLE TOPIC OF HIS STATE OF THE STATE ADDRESS THIS YEAR- BUT WE CAN'T RELY ON THAT WE AS A LEGISLATURE WE CAN ESTABLISH THIS OFFICE- TO END HOMELESSNESS OKAY. THE I'M JUST GONNA SHARE SOME PERSONAL DISAPPOINTMENTS WITH THE WITH THAT. NOT THIS BILL OR WITH- WHAT'S HAPPENED SO FAR FROM THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH. YEAH MY OFFICES RESULTS AS SOON AS A CENTER STEINBERG WAS APPOINTED AS CO CHAIR CHAIRMAN OR WHATEVER IT WAS. HOMELESSNESS IS A BIG DEAL ALL OVER THE STATE- IN MY DISTRICT I REPRESENT MOSTLY. A SUBURBAN AND RURAL AREAS OF SAN DIEGO COUNTY. THAT HISTORICALLY HAVE BEEN KIND OF. NOT IMPACTED TO DRAMATICALLY BY HOMELESSNESS WE'VE ALWAYS HAD YOU KNOW SOME ISSUES OF IT BUT NOT BUT NOT A LOT- BUT SINCE THE PASSAGE OF AB ONE OH NINE AND PROP 47-57. WHICH I THINK IS- EXACERBATED THE PROBLEMS OF HOMELESSNESS AND ACTUALLY I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT- I. IMPORTANT AT POLICY IT WANT PROTECT THIS THIS PROBLEM OF HOMELESSNESS. THE WE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THERE'S- I THINK STATEWIDE AND AN NATION WIDE ACCEPTANCE THAT. HOMELESSNESS IS ACTUALLY BROKEN UP INTO THREE DIFFERENT- NOT. ENTIRELY DISTINCT CATEGORIES OF CITIZENS BUT- THERE'S SOME COMMONALITY BETWEEN THE CRIMINAL ELEMENT OF- VAGRANCY AND TRESPASSING AND DRUG ADDICTION AS ONE GROUP. ANOTHER GROUP BEING- YOU KNOW WHATEVER SCALEOF MENTAL ILLNESS FROM A MINOR TO SEVERE. THAT'S ANOTHER GROUP AND IN THE THIRD GROUP AS WELL I THINK WE CAN PLEDGE A CALL- TRULY HOMELESS THOSE THAT ARE DOWN AND OUT ON THEIR LOCKED IT HAD JOBS. SINGLE MOM KIDS DADS WITH KIDS- SELVES. FINANCIAL SETBACK THAT HAS PUT THEM INTO THIS CATEGORY OF HOMELESSNESS THAT I BELIEVE THE STATE AND A LOT OF THE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS ARE DOING A REALLY GOOD JOB OF. HELPING THOSE PEOPLE GET A HAND UP AND MOVE BACK INTO A PRODUCTIVE ELEMENT OF SOCIETY. THE CHALLENGE THAT I HAVE WITH WHERE OUR STATE IS RIGHT NOW IS DEALING WITH THE OTHER TWO CATEGORIES- THE SEVERE THE MENTALLY ILL AND I KNOW THAT CENTER BELL HAS BEEN COMMITTED TO THAT EVER SINCE I SERVING THEM HERE. IN THE LEGISLATURE NOT APPLIED THE EFFORT THAT HE HAS TAKEN. TO DEAL WITH THAT ISSUE NOT AND HE AND I HAVE COOPERATED ON ON MANY THINGS TO DO THAT. THE I THINK. WHERE WERE FOR LOSING OUR WAY IN CALIFORNIA'S ON THE CRIMINAL ELEMENT OF THIS. AND UNTIL WE ON WIND AB ONE OH NINE. AND UNDO PARTS OF PROP FORTY SEVEN AND PROP FIFTY SEVEN WE'RE NOT GOING TO SOLVE THIS. THAT ELEMENT OF THE HOMELESSNESS. AND I EVEN LIKE. ALMOST DON'T WANT TO CALL IT HOMELESSNESS BECAUSE THESE PEOPLE ARE MAKING BAD LIFE CHOICES. BETTER PUT THEM ON THE STREETS AND SOME OF THEM WANT TO STAY ON THE STREETS THEY THEY DON'T WANT TO. BE PRODUCTIVE MEMBERS OF SOCIETY SO UNTIL WE- ADDRESS THAT CRIMINAL ELEMENT I THINK ALL OF THIS OTHER STUFF THAT WE'RE DOING. WE'RE JUST. FOR LACK OF A BETTER TERM BUT IN THE WINDOW LITTLE BIT AND TILL WE AS POLICYMAKERS MAKE THE TOUGH CHOICES. THAT WE'RE GONNA ADDRESSES CRIMINAL ELEMENT OF THE VACANCY IN THE TRUST PASSING AND THE LIVING ON THE STREETS- I DON'T KNOW THAT. IS THAT YOUR IDEA I HAD ABOUT THE BILL PACKAGE AT THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR WITH FIVE BILLS. THAT ADDRESS SOME OF THIS SOME OF THE THINGS WE'RE GONNA BE VOTING ON TODAY. I WAS GONNA. THE TACKLE AND THEN WE AS WE ASKED TO. PULL BACK SOME OF OUR BILLS ARE THOSE THE ONES THAT I PULLED BACK I KEPT ONE OF THEM GO ON SO. I ACTUALLY WAS GOING TO VOTE NO ON THIS TODAY BUT. HE TESTIMONY. AND YOU GET SOME SUPPORT. OF WHO I. APPRECIATE THEIR OPINION. SOME A LAYOFF TODAY ON THIS- AND I'VE I'M SORRY BATMAN CHARM I'M PROBABLY MORE. BLOVIATING THAN I AM. ASKING A QUESTION IF YOU LIKE TO ADDRESSING THOSE ISSUES I'M I'M HAPPY TO HEAR YOUR RESPONSE TO ANY OF THAT. THANK YOU SENATOR. YOU KNOW I AGREE WITH YOU YOU KNOW THIS IS NOT JUST AN URBAN OR RURAL ISSUE YOU KNOW I'M FROM LOS ANGELES YOUR YOU YOU MENTIONED YOU HAVE RURAL AND SUBURBAN. AREAS IN YOUR DISTRICT AND WERE ALL EQUALLY AFFECTED- AND I THINK IT'S TIME THAT OUR STATE- START BY CREATING A GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE. WILL BETTER ADDRESS LISTS- AND I THINK THAT IS A START- AND BY STREAMLINING- WE AND- BRINGING THE RESOURCES EXISTING RESOURCES THAT WE ALREADY HAVE. AN ELEVATING THIS ISSUE WE WILL ABLE TO. WE WOULD BE ABLE TO WORK THANK YOU TOWARDS IRAQ I THINK IS ONE OF THE CLEAR MY FRUSTRATION IS NOT WITH HIS BILL OR OR DO YOU AS AN AUTHOR OBVIOUSLY. MY FRUSTRATION REALLY IS WHAT THE GOVERNOR. MADE A BUNCH OF PROMISES BOTH IN HIS PAIN AND THEN HE EXPECTED THEM IN THE STATE. STATE YES. AND WE- IN THIS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU WE WILL NOW MOVE ON TO SENATOR JACKSON AT THIS TIME THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATE JACKSON HERE I WASN'T REALLY PLANNING TO DO A- DEFENSE OF THE GOVERNOR BUT I WOULD LIKE TO REMIND MY GOOD CALLING FROM LOS ANGELES. IN THE TIME OF. STATE OF THE STATE SPEECH AND TODAY WE'VE HAD SOMETHING CALLED COVERT NINETEEN IF WE WANT TO PUT BLAME ON ANYONE FOR THAT I THINK WE NEED TO LOOK AT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IN THE LACK OF LEADERSHIP THERE SO THIS DOESN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE GOVERNOR- AT THIS MOMENT THIS HAS TO DO WITH THE SOCIETAL PROBLEM IT'S EXISTED FOR DECADES AND CALIFORNIA IS THE HOME TO MORE HOMELESS PEOPLE. IN MEASURE BECAUSE YOU HAVE A CHOICE BETWEEN BEING HOMELESS IN DECEMBER IN YOUR CAR HOMELESS IN DECEMBER IN CALIFORNIA- YOU WILL TO CALIFORNIA SO THAT IS PART OF THE PROBLEM IS THE MAIN. YOU CAN WE- I THINK IT WAS GOOD AT THE- HE OPENED UP DORS TO OUR- AND MANY INSTITUTIONS PROMISING THAT WE WOULD END UP WITH A COMMUNITY BASED CARE FOR THOSE PEOPLE WHO SUFFER MENTAL ILLNESS AND NEVER FUNDED IT. SO THAT'S OUR IF WE START LOOKING AT WHERE THE PROBLEM LIES OR WHERE IT STARTED- THAT BEING SAID WE HAVE PEOPLE WITH TERRIBLE SUBSTANCE ABUSE ISSUES ARE THAT WE HAPPEN TO DRESSED IN THE WHAT WE DO WITH THEM. PRIMARILY AS WE PUT THEM IN JAIL THAT DOESN'T SOLVE THE THEIR SUBSTANCE ABUSE PROBLEMS THEN THEY COME BACK OUT ON THE STREETS THEY HAVE NOWHERE TO GO THEY RE OFFEND IF YOU WILL WITH VAGRANCY OR WHAT HAPPENED AND IN THE BACK. I IN IN INCARCERATION COSTING THE STATE ENORMOUS AMOUNTS OF MONEY- THE SO CALLED CRIMINAL ELEMENT I WOULD SUGGEST THOUGH THE RESULTS ARE RESOLUTE AND IS TO. A DAM OPPOSITION FORTY SEVEN AND OTHERS THAT ARE TRYING TO REFORM THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM BUT TO SUPPORT THEM BECAUSE THE GOAL OF THOSE PROGRAMS IS TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE DON'T RESIDENT RIGHT THAT THEY HAVE A PLACE TO LIVE A JOB TO GO TO ANALYZE TO HALF. SO I WASN'T REALLY PLANNING ON DOING THAT IN THE DRESSING THIS BILL BUT SINCE TO BEG THE QUESTION ARE I THINK THAT WE REALLY HAVE TO BE HONEST AND ACCURATE ABOUT WHAT THE PROBLEMS ARE SO I WANT TO SUPPORT THIS AND I WANT TO THANK THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER. FOR BRINGING IT BECAUSE ALMOST HAS BEEN A PROBLEM IN CALIFORNIA FOR DECADES WHEN I FIRST STARTED MY LEGAL CAREER RIGHT SANTA BARBARA COUNTY- CAR WAS PROBLEM CREATED ENORMOUS IMPACT ON OUR COURT SYSTEM OUR CREW JOHN JUST- IN THE. THOSE WHO NEED HELP. AND WE NEED TO DO BETTER AND I THINK THAT CREATING THIS FOCUS AND HAVING A SYSTEM. WHERE WE SET UP A- BASED YOU KNOW HOMELESSNESS BASED A SERIES OF EFFORTS AND PROGRAMS FROM HOME FROM HOUSING TO MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES AND I KNOW MY GOOD COLLEAGUE SENATOR BELT COULD PROBABLY TALK ABOUT THIS ISSUE FOR HOURS BECAUSE OF HIS COMMITMENT. TO IMPROVING THE MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAMS THAT WE HAVE IN THE STATE- I THINK THIS IS A REALLY EXCELLENT IDEA TO DEMONSTRATE THE COMMITMENT THAT WE HAVE AS A STATE AND AS A LEGISLATURE- TO DEALING WITH THIS ISSUE AND I HAVE EVERY CONFIDENCE THAT. THE GOVERNOR DOES SHARE THIS- PERSPECTIVE AND- I SUSPECT WILL- MAKE APPOINTMENTS TO WITH THAT REFLECT THAT COMMITTEE. AND THE COMMITMENT TO EXCELLENCE THAT YOU HOPE. OKAY AND WE WILL BE TO PURSUE HEARING SO WITH THE I KNOW THAT SENATOR BEAT ME TO MOVING THE BUT I'M- I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING. THANK YOU. DO WE HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS SAYS CENTER WINNER. THANK YOU AYE MANAGER WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD I'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT THIS WAS A VERY GOOD. AND IMPORTANT BILL- BUT ACTUALLY- HAS BECOME MUCH MORE RELEVANT AND- YOU KNOW I WANT TO SAY AND I DON'T THINK THAT THIS I DON'T THINK THERE'S BEEN A NOT URGENT ENOUGH OF A SENSE OF URGENCY. IN THIS BUILDING- ABOUT THE WAVE OF HOMELESSNESS THAT IS GOING TO HIT US AS WE SEE MASSIVE ACTIONS. HAPPENING IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE ARE. IN A PLACE RIGHT NOW. WHERE WE HAVE A HUMAN 40% OF CALIFORNIANS ARE RENTERS LIKE SIXTEEN MILLION PEOPLE. AND THEY ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY LOWER INCOME OR EVEN VERY LOW INCOME. THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO BEFORE THE PANDEMIC WERE OFTEN HANGING ON. BY THEIR FINGERNAILS. AND NOW THEY HAVE SO MANY OF THEM HAVE LOST THEIR JOBS. THEY ARE IN DIRE STRAITS AND NOW BECAUSE OF INACTION FIVE AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL THEIR UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS ARE TANKING. THAT IS IF THEY'VE BEEN ABLE TO GET UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS BECAUSE OF THE MELTDOWN- ET DE. AND SO WE FACE THE VERY REAL PROSPECT THAT IN THE COMING MONTHS I THINK AT THE BEGINNING BECAUSE OF MAYBE MINIMAL SAVINGS THAT PEOPLE OUTSIDE OR- BECAUSE THEY GOT THE EXTRA SIX HUNDRED UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS. OR RECALLS THAT A LANDLORD WHO IS UNDERSTANDING AT LEAST FOR A LITTLE WHILE. YOU KNOW THERE WAS A IS NARRATIVE UNKNOWNS WE PEOPLE AREN'T DEFAULTING ON THE RENT AND LARGE NUMBERS. OF THAT IS CHANGING DRAMATICALLY I'M NOT CHANGED WORK CELERY IN THE COMING MONTHS AND WE FACE THE VERY REAL PROSPECT OF A HUGE NUMBER. OF LOW INCOME CALIFORNIA. BECOMING HOMELESS NOW AND IN THE COMING MONTHS. AND SO I HAVE A QUESTION FOR THE L. A. O. BASED ON ITS REPORT- IN TERMS OF. IN PARTICULAR. NOT JUST WHAT WE'RE SEEING IN HOMELESSNESS BUT WHAT WE CAN ANTICIPATE A SPIKE IN HOMELESSNESS. OF OUR WORKING POOR. IN THE COMING MONTHS. IS THE STRUCTURE. THAT EXECUTIVE BRANCH HAS A NET HAS IN PLACE NOW. ADEQUATE TO THE TASK. TO DEAL WITH A POTENTIAL SIGNIFICANT. SPIKE IN HOMELESSNESS BECAUSE OF THIS BILL IS ABOUT. IT'S ABOUT A RESTRUCTURING TO BETTER BE BETTER EQUIPPED TO CONFRONT THIS CRISIS. BUT MY QUESTION TO THE L. L. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION THIS IS JENNY BALLOT AGAIN WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. YEAH OUR RECORDS IDENTIFIED THE NEED FOR IMPROVED GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE EVEN PRIOR TO THE CURRENT COLD AT NINETEEN- STATE OF EMERGENCY AND SO I THINK THAT BECAUSE OF THE ISSUES THAT YOU RAIN. TODAY BOTH ISSUES ARE HEIGHTENED AND IF ANYTHING THE CHALLENGES FOR THIRD RESULTING FROM COLBERT NINETEEN MAKE THE NEED FOR IMPROVED GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE. EVEN MORE APPARENTLY SOMETHING THAT THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD BE CONSIDERING. THANK YOU. THANK YOU WE HAVE ONE MORE QUESTION FROM CENTRE BELL. RESERVE THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT- DIRECTION I THINK WE NEED TO TAKE. YES OF COURSE MY FAMILY WE WERE HOMELESS WE HAD A FIRE. HOUSE BURNED DOWN. THE TWELVE OF US SO. COACH SIR FOR OVER A YEAR FINDING PLACES TO LIVE FROM VARIOUS PEOPLE- AT THE TIME WE DID HAVE. DEPRESSION IT WAS TOUGH. I REMEMBER THE FAMILY REALLY- REACHED OUT TO. OUR SPIRITUALITY AND OUR OUR CHURCH TO HELP US. SURVIVE THE CRISIS OUR FAMILY WAS AND- WE. WE REQUIRE THE OLDER CHILDREN TO GO TO WORK AND I WAS ONE OF THE OLDER CHILDREN SO I WANT TO WORK I FIND OUT THAT THERE WAS RULES ABOUT MY AGE. SO I GUESS SORRY FUDGE MY AGE ON SOME OF THE APPLICATIONS STATING I WAS A LITTLE OLDER THAN I WAS I WAS FOURTEEN AT THE TIME SO I FUDGED A LITTLE BIT RIGHT NOW I THINK THERE'S A STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS FOR THAT BUT. YOU KNOW SO I GUESS THAT MAKES ME A CRIMINAL. IT'S LIKE UP SO THERE'S. MY OBSERVATION AS- YEAH YOU DO THINGS WHEN YOU'RE HOMELESS BUT YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE HOMELESS FOREVER OKAY SO YOU SHOULD HAVE LABELS ON PEOPLE. OKAY I THINK PEOPLE RECOVER FROM HOMELESSNESS HOPEFULLY MOST OF THEM DO. AND REACH UP AND NOT RECOVER. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A SITUATION WHERE. WE MAY FACED AS A PROBABLY WILL FACES- CENTER WINNER WAS POINTING OUT. A GREAT INCREASE IN HOMELESSNESS. BUT WE HAVE TO WE HAVE TO TAKE THE POSITIVE VIEWPOINT THE. THE PEOPLE THAT ARE HOMELESS THAT WILL BECOME HOMELESS OR PEOPLE THAT WE CAN HELP WE CAN ASSUME THIS WEEKEND. DEVELOP STRATEGIES THE BILL POINTS OUT AND THAT AND I THINK ANOTHER THING WE AGREE THE REVOLVES ALL THE DIFFERENT THINGS HEALTH CARE CRIMINAL JUSTICE. ALL THE ELEMENTS. AND IT ALSO MEANS THAT THEY SHOULD WORK TOGETHER. AS A TEAM. THAT THE BILL REQUIRES GENERAL CROSS SYSTEM GENERAL CROSS SYSTEM SO SORRY TAKEN POINTING OUT SOME OF THE ASSETS THAT I SEE IN THE BILL. THE MENTAL HEALTH THING. ONLY 14% OF PEOPLE GET ADEQUATE MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT THAT'S GOING TO THAT IS A PROBLEM TO HAVE DENTURES 0% GET ADEQUATE MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT IF THEY BECOME HOMELESS. SO I CHECKED. I THINK THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT BILL IN TERMS OF GETTING THE GOVERNOR PUTTING IT IN THE GOVERNOR OFFICE AS OPPOSED TO LETTING EACH DEPARTMENT OR EACH AGENCY DO WITH ALMOST A SEPARATELY I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE NOT. HAVE SERVE A KEYSTONE COPS APPROACH TO HOMELESSNESS THAT WE HAVE A COORDINATED EFFICIENT. APPROACH AND NOT WASTE MONEY CHASING RAINBOWS ARECHOOSING DIFFERENT SOLUTIONS IN EACH EACH LITTLE BOX THAT WE PUT OURSELVES AND THEN THE DEPARTMENTS AND GOVERNMENT BUREAUCRACIES SO HI I THINK THIS IS A- I. THINK THAT WE SHOULD BE DOING MORE OF CROSS SYSTEMS KIND OF ISSUES THAT COVER MOST APART DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS AND- I APPRECIATE THE BILL I THOUGHT IT WAS A WISE BOTH. OF THE DISPLAYED SOME WISDOM. THAT WE NEED TO HAVE IN THE LIGHT OF THE CRISIS THERE WERE AND SO- JUICE HERE TO SUPPORT THIS BILL. THANK YOU. SENATOR PAN THANK YOU MEASURE AND APPRECIATE YOUR INDULGENCE I DECIDE ANOTHER REFERENCE WAS MADE TO MENTAL HEALTH SUBSTANCE USE AND HOMELESSNESS I JUST DO WANT TO POINT OUT THAT- WILL CERTAINLY MENTAL HEALTH. ISSUES COULD EXXON OR VULNERABLE TO BECOMING HOMELESS IT'S USUALLY THE OTHER WAY AROUND IT'S WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT THROUGH ECONOMIC MEANS OR OTHER WAYS PEOPLE BECOME HOMELESS AND THEN THERE MENTAL. SUBSTANCE USE INCREASES BECAUSE YOU LOSE THE SOCIAL SUPPORT AND VARIOUS OTHER FACTORS WILL GO INTO RIGHT NOW SO- I KNOW THAT OFTENTIMES PEOPLE TALK ABOUT WELL YOU KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES WHO ARE HOMELESS. JUST KEEP IN MIND THAT THERE HOMELESSNESS IS BY WHAT'S EXACERBATING OR MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES MENTAL HEALTH ITSELF DOESN'T CAUSE HOMELESSNESS. NECESSARILY AND- ATTACK THAT'S WHY HOUSING FIRST IS A VERY IMPORTANT AND DIVERGENCE BASED APPROACH TO ADDRESSING THESE SSUES AS WELL BECAUSE YOU CAN ACTUALLY GET SOMEONE INTO A HOME- INTO A PLACE THEN YOU CAN ACTUALLY START TACKLING THESE ISSUES I THINK A CENTER BILL SAID. PROBABLY YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE HOMELESS OR UNLIKELY TO BE GETTING THE TREATMENT THEY NEED BUT ALSO POINT OUT THAT BEING HOMELESS ITSELF IS. A RISK FACTOR FOR EXACERBATIONS OF THOSE CONDITIONS SO WITH THAT I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY JUST TO MENTION THANK YOU. SENATOR MELINDA. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- ASSEMBLY WOMAN RIVAS THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD AND I CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO I'M AND I COMMEND THAT AND I'D AND I'D- RESPECT THE OPINION COMING FROM MY COLLEAGUES HERE ON THE COMMITTEE- AND IT'S YOU KNOW IT'S IT IT'S AN ISSUE THAT DESERES TO BE DEALT WITH COMPASSIONATELY I'M REGARDLESS OF WHY YOU THINK A PERSON IS HOMELESS- IT IT IS A COMPASSIONATE ISSUE- BUT MY ISSUE. WITH THE BILL IS THAT. I DON'T KNOW THAT WE NEED TO CREATE ANOTHER- CIRCLE OF BUREAUCRACY TO DEAL WITH THE ISSUE I THINK THERE ARE A LOT OF OTHER THINGS THAT WE CAN DO I UNDERSTAND WHERE YOU'RE COMING FROM THAT YOU FEEL LIKE SOME SORT OF CENTRALIZED OVERSIGHT MAKES MORE SENSE BUT- HONESTLY I FEEL AS THOUGH IT NEEDS TO BE. ANY TO CONTINUE PERHAPS MORE SAID LOCAL LEVEL RATHER THAN FROM THE TOP DOWN- BECAUSE IT IS DIFFICULT FOR. THOSE OF US APPEARING SACRAMENTO TO KNOW EXACTLY WHAT'S GOING ON ON THE GROUND IN SOME OF THESE COUNTIES- I HAD. A COMMUNICATION WITH- SOMEONE IN SAN FRANCISCO ACTUALLY THIS WEEKEND WHO IS HOMELESS AND SHE WAS VERY FRUSTRATED THAT POLITICIANS KEEP YOU KNOW THAT WE KEEP TRYING TO FIX THE PROBLEM. I AND- THE HER FEELING WAS THE PROBLEM IS BECAUSE LIVING IS TOO HIGH WE'RE NOT DOING ENOUGH TO LOWER THE COST OF LIVING AND THAT WE ARE ACTUALLY- MAKING IT WORSE. BY GETTING MORE INVOLVED AT THE TOP. IN THIS IS SOMEONE WHO'S LIVING IT YOU KNOW SHE'S WORKING BY. HE JUST CAN'T AFFORD THE COST OF LIVING HERE SO UNFORTUNATELY THOUGH I'D I KNOW WHERE YOUR HEART IS ON THIS BILL AND I THANK YOU FOR THAT I'M NOT. GOING TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THE BILL SIMPLY BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE. IT NEEDS TO GO LOWER RATHER THAN GO HIGHER BUT I DO THINK THAT WE ALL ARE ON THE SAME PAGE WITH RESPECT TO. GETTING SOME THINGS DONE THAT ACTUALLY ALLEVIATE THIS PROBLEM BECAUSE AS SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES MENTIONED THIS HOMELESSNESS ISSUE HAS ONLY GOTTEN WORSE IN CALIFORNIA OVER MANY MANY YEARS. AND NO MATTER WHAT POLITICIANS. TRY TO DO IT DOESN'T APPEAR TO BE GETTING ANY BETTER IN FACT IT ACTUALLY SEEMS TO BE GETTING WORSE SO I AM LESS INCLINED. TO SUPPORT A GROUP THAT IS HEADED BY. PEOPLE FRANKLY WHO WERE FRIENDS TO THE CITIES I HAVE SOME OF THE WORST HOMELESSNESS IN THE STATE- TO. ME TO PUT MY SUPPORT. BEHIND THE BUT BUT AGAIN THANK YOU AYE I KNOW YOUR HEART IS ON THIS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU ARE AT THIS MOMENT AUTHORED WOULD YOU WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. SURE THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS- THROUGH THIS DISCUSSION I THINK IT SHOWS HOW IMPORTANT THIS ISSUE IS TO ALL OF US- REAP WHAT REGARDLESS OF WHERE WE'RE- THIS IS. A DISH. ALL TO BE ALL THE TO SEE I APPRECIATE THE WORK THAT THE GOVERNOR HAS DONE SO FAR TO ELEVATE HOMELESSNESS- AS SENATOR JACKSON MENTIONED IT'S ONLY BEEN A FEW MONTHS- SINCE THE STATE OF THE STATE WE ARE STILL IN THIS YEAR AND THIS IS STILL AN OPPORTUNITY- TO START. BOND OR CONTINUE THE WORK ON HOMELESSNESS- BY BY EIGHT CREATING THIS THIS GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE THAT'S DESIGNED TO BE MORE EFFECTIVE- AND TO STREAMLINE OUR EXISTING PROGRAMS- YOU KNOW AT. LEADERS I THINK WE NEED TO CONSIDER THE BENEFITS OF CREATING THIS. LASTING STRUCTURAL CHANGE TO. THE CENTRALIZED OFFICE ON HOMELESSNESS IS NOT SOMETHING. THAT CAN BE DONE VIA EXECUTIVE ORDER THIS IS SOMETHING THAT THE LEGISLATURE COULD PUT INTO STATUTE. AND CREATE THIS OFFICE SO IT CONTINUES TO EXIST. BEYOND THIS. ADMINISTRATION OF. OUR FOCUS ON HOMELESSNESS NOT BE SUBJECT TO THE WHIMS OF AN ADMINISTRATION IT SHOULD BE SOMETHING THAT THE LEGISLATURE. OF YOU KNOW PRIORITIZES AND CONTINUES TO WORK ON- BEYOND THE ADMINISTRATION. LIKE THIS IS JUST THIS ISSUE OF COURSE LIKE YOU HAVE MENTIONED IS NOT JUST A STATE LEVEL ISSUE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS- HAVE DONE A LOT OF WORK ALREADY AND I THINK THAT BY ESTABLISHING THIS OFFICE WE WILL BE ABLE TO PROVIDE MORE SUPPORT. TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS- AND NOT LESS WE'RE NOT TAKING STAFF FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND PUTTING IT INTO A STATE OFFICE WE ARE. CENTRALIZING OUR CURRENT STRUCTURE TO PROVIDE MORE SUPPORT TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS SO THAT THEY CAN CONTINUE THE WORK THAT THEY'RE DOING ON HOMELESSNESS OF THIS LEGISLATION HAS GARNERED THE SUPPORT OF A SACRAMENTO MAYOR DARRELL STEINBERG WHO. WAS A CO CHAIR OF THE GOVERNMENT'S GOVERNOR'S HOMELESSNESS TASK FORCE- LA MAYOR ERIC GARCETTI THE L. A. COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS STOCKTON MAYOR MICHAEL TUBBS ABSOLUTELY THE LEADERS ON THAT HAVE SUPPORTED THIS- AS A WAY. FOR THE STATE TO PROVIDE MORE SUPPORT TO THEIR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS- FROM HOMELESSNESS LIKE COVE IT IT'S NOT AND URBAN VERSUS RURAL ISSUE. IT'S A CALIFORNIA ISSUE. THIS MEASURE HAS RECEIVED BIPARTISAN SUPPORT AND IT AND HAS NO OPPOSITION I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU.

AT THIS MOMENT ARE WE WILL BE TAKING UP ITEM NUMBER EIGHT ASSEMBLY BUILT. AT TWENTY THREE EIGHTY SEVEN ASSEMBLY MEMBER GRAYSON. REFORMED REMOTELY THROUGH TELEHEALTH PROVIDED THE CLIENTS MEET CERTAIN REQUIREMENTS B. I. HSS PROGRAM IS A MEDIC CAL BASED PROGRAM THAT IS INTENDED TO ALLOW LOW INCOME AGED BLIND AND DISABLED PERSONS INCLUDING CHILDREN WHO ARE AT RISK FOR OUT OF HOME PLACEMENT TO REMAIN SAFELY AT HOME BY PROVIDING PAYMENT FOR CARE PROVIDERS SERVICES. IN ORDER TO CONTINUE ELIGIBILITY FOR IHS US SERVICES A CLIENT MUST BE REASSESSED EVERY TWELVE MONTHS AND REQUIRES A FACE TO FCE HOME VISIT HOWEVER FOR MANY LOW RISK I HSS CLIENTS WITH NO CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES OR LIVING ARRANGEMENTS IN PERSON ANNUAL REASSESSMENTS CAN OFTEN BE TIME CONSUMING AND DIFFICULT TO SCHEDULE. ANNUAL IN PERSON ASSESSMENTS ALSO POTENTIALLY POSE A WORKLOAD PROBLEM FOR COUNTY SOCIAL WORKERS ASSESSMENTS REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT TRAVEL TIME WHICH LIMITS THE NUMBER OF CLIENTS THAT CAN BE REACHED IN A SINGLE DAY FURTHER DELAYING ASSESSMENTS OR REASSESSMENTS. BACKLOG OF REASSESSMENTS NEGATIVELY IMPACTS THE ABILITY OF COUNTIES TO EFFECTIVELY ASSESS. RECIPIENT NEEDS. GET THE INCREASING DEMAND FOR I. HSS AND WITH THE CURRENT SITUATION REVOLVES REVOLVING AROUND COVERT NINETEEN THE INTRODUCTION OF REMOTE TELEHEALTH ASSESSMENTS WILL ALLOW STREAMLINING ANNUAL REASSESSMENTS. ENSURING EFFICIENT ACCESS TO SERVICES WHILE ALSO PROTECTING VULNERABLE I HSS CLIENTS AN ESSENTIAL COUNTY SOCIAL WORKERS. I ALSO REALIZE THAT THERE MAY BE CONCERNS REGARDING THIS BILL AND THE BRANCH TO PROVIDE I JOIN ASSESSMENTS SO IN PERSON HOWEVER WE HAVE MADE EVERY EFFORT TO PROVIDE THE NECESSARY SAFEGUARDS IN ORDER TO PROTECT CLIENTS. THAT TO NOT LET THEM FALL THROUGH THE CRACKS THRUGH THE THROUGH THE CRACKS THIS BILL ONLY CREATES THE OPTION FOR COUNTIES TO PROVIDE REMOTE TELEHEALTH US ASSESSMENTS FOR EXTREMELY LOW RISK CLIENTS. BUT IT DOES NOT MAKE IT MANDATORY WELL THE GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE ORDER ALREADY ALLOWS THIS TEMPORARILY WE BELIEVE THAT IT'S INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT TO HAVE PERMANENT STRUCTURES IN PLACE. TO CONTINUE TO PROTECT VULNERABLE CLIENTS FROM COVERT NINETEEN OR ANY POSSIBLE FUTURE EMERGENCIES SO WITH THAT I WOULD LIKE TO INTRODUCE TRACY MURRAY DIRECTOR OF AGING AND ADULT SERVICES. CONTRA. COSTA EMPLOYMENT AND HUMAN SERVICES. THANK YOU WE WILL NOT OPEN IT UP TO WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OF TO CONSIDER THE LINK MEANS POLICY CONSIDERATIONS AND CLEANING PROTOCOLS WE WILL INSTITUTE TIME LIMITS ON TESTIMONY.

CURRENTLY HAS YOUR WORKERS ARE ABLE TO CONDUCT TELEPHONIC REASSESSMENTS FOR I. HSS. WE KNOW THAT ASSESSMENTS HAVE GAINED GROUND AND OTHER PRO INCLUDING WORK MANY AND INTERVIEWING.

WE THE TALIBAN AND REASSESSMENTS ARE IN ADDITION TOOL AVAILABLE TO SOCIAL WORKERS AND I HSS RECIPIENTS PROVIDING FLEXIBILITY CONVENIENCE FOR CONSUMERS AND EFFICIENCIES FOR COUNTY. IN THE CURRENT ENVIRONMENT WE HAVE A FEEDBACK FROM MANY I HSS CONSUMER TO EXPRESSED APPRECIATION FOR THE ABILITY TO PARTICIPATE IN ANNUAL REASSESSMENT OVER THE PHONE. AND WE KNOW THAT TELEPHONICALLY ASSESSED HELP KEEP OUR CONSUMERS AND WORKERS HEALTHY. I UNDERSTAND TRACK. HELLO CHRISTMAS ENABLES WORKERS GOT MORE TIME DEVOTED TO RESPONDING TO I. HFS CONSUMER EIGHT. PASSAGE OF THIS BILL WOULD PREVENT HFS RECIPIENT'S CHOICE BUT HOW THEY ARE UPSET. AND WOULD PRESERVE OPTIONS BY ALLOWING ANYONE TO OPT IN FOR ANY IN PERSON REASSESSMENT EVEN AFTER TELEPHONIC ASSESSMENTS HAVE BEEN OFFERED.

TWO ONE SEVEN FOUR BY GALLAGHER AND HAVE A STANDARD. ON THE BILL TODAY. THANK YOU MAN SHERMAN SENATORS SO I'M PRESENTING THIS BILL ON BEHALF ASSEMBLY MEMBER GALLAGHER WHICH WOULD AUTHORIZE YUBA AND SUTTER COUNTIES TO FORM A JOINT HOMELESS MULTI DISCIPLINARY PERSONNEL THIS TEAM WOULD FACILITATE INFORMATION SHARING. TO SUPPORT THE IDENTIFICATION ASSESSMENT AND LEAKAGE OF HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS TO THEIR HOUSING AND SUPPORT SERVICES. THESE THESE- TEAMS ARE PROVEN TOOL THAT ALLOWS TEAMS OF VARYING VARYING DISCIPLINES TO COORDINATE THEIR EFFORTS AND HAVE BEEN SEARCHED SUCCESSFULLY USED FOR THE PAST THIRTY YEARS TO ADDRESS CHILD ABUSE OR NEGLECT. A SERVICE PROVIDERS TO WORK TOGETHER TO SHARE CASE INFORMATION RECENTLY- HUH- THEY HAVE BEEN USED FOR HOMELESSNESS UNFORTUNATELY OUR CURRENT LAW LIMITS THE UTILIZATION OF HALMOS MULTI DISCIPLINARY TEAMS TO PROVIDERS WITHIN A SINGLE COUNTY THIS CAN BE PROBLEMATIC FOR COUNTIES THAT WISH TO. COORDINATE SERVICES ACROSS COUNTY LINES- LIKE YUBA AND SUTTER. IN COORDINATION AND INFORMATION SHARING MAKES A LOT OF SENSE FOR THESE COUTIES AS THEY ALREADY SHARE HOMELESS SERVICE PROVIDERS HAVE A BY COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT. AND I'VE CREATED A BY COUNTY HOMELESS CONSORTIUM THE BILL WOULD- HELP YEAH EFFORTS TO PROVIDE HOUSING AND SUPPORT SERVICES TO HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS. YEAH WHICH ARE STRICTLY CRITICAL- DURING OUR COVERT NINETEEN CRISIS THAT WE'VE SEEN OUR HOMELESS POPULATION. IS PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE DURING THIS CRISIS. THE INCREASE COORDINATION- BETWEEN THE COUNTIES WOULD ALSO CREATE A COST SAVINGS AND IMPROVE GOVERNMENT EFFICIENCY BY PREVENTING DUPLICATIVE EFFORTS- THROUGH BETTER COORDINATION WHILE ENHANCING CONTINUE CONTINUE OF CARE FOR HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES. AND THIS TIME THE SPEAKERS FROM. SUTTER COUNTY ADULT SERVICES BRANCH DIRECTOR FROM HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES MARK MARK SHOOTS LEMIRE. AND SHE LOOKED DARK GLASIER FROM YUBA COUNTY TELL WORKS HOMELESS PROJECT MANAGER SO I'LL TURN IT OVER THE SPEAKERS. HI THIS IS MARC SPORTS MYRON THEY- FELT BRANCH DIRECTOR I WOULD LIKE TO DECEMBER IN THAT THE BILL SIMPLY TAKES THE EXISTING HOMES MULTI DISCIPLINARY TEAM STATUTE AND ALLOW SUTTER AND YUBA COUNTIES TOGETHER UNDER THE SAME PARAMETERS- ALSO THE SCIENTISTS I SAID THE BILL DOESN'T EXPAND OR CHANGE PRIVACY RIGHTS. OF INDIVIDUALS WHAT'S ARE ALLOWED EXISTING HOMELESS MULTI DISCIPLINARY TEAM STATUTES SO INTO OF IT SO WHAT WE WOULD DO WANT TO GIVE A MORE BACK ABOUT CENTERS IN YOU THE- EACH BIKE HOMELESS BE. WE CREATED A UP TO THAT WAS FOCUS ON A MY COUNTY CALLED A SINGLE. AND RESOLUTIONS WHAT THE SAME DOESN'T SOCIAL SERVICES BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS AND ONE. REGIONAL MULTI DISCIPLINARY TEAM. AND THIS TEAM PROVIDE EXTENSIVE SUPPORT AND LINKAGE TO SERVICES IN AN EFFORT TO CONDUCT. COMPASSIONATE KERN FORTUNATE FOR OUR HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS. HUMBOLDT COUNTY'S ALL FOR THIRTY MINUTES UNITS ABOUT EACH. WE'VE ALL. GROUPE. THE SHARED AND YOU THAT WILL THE MOST DISCIPLINARY TEAMS OPERATE IN ALL THE JURORS. SO THIS BILL WILL HELP TO SOLVE A CRITICAL PIECE OF THE WORK THAT THE TEAM WILL DO. AS WITH OTHER MULTI DISCIPLINARY TEAMS BEING ABLE TO SHARE BASIC INFORMATION ON TEAM MEMBERS OF THE CENTRAL. TO ACCOMPLISHING THE MISSION OF THE TEAM AND AS YOU'RE AWARE HOMELESS IS HOMELESSNESS THE- COME ISSUE. DRESSER COMMUNICATION AMONG THOSE TRYING TO SOLVE IT. IS A BASIC REQUIREMENT FOR OUR SUCCESS. AS A TEAM START YOUR JOURNEY TO A PLACE OF TREMENDOUS AMOUNT FOR. US SO FAR IN TWO. A COOPERATIVE APPROACH AND WITHOUT PASSAGE OF THIS BILL WILL BE VERY DIFFICULT TO ACCOMPLISH OUR MISSION OF ADDRESSING HOMELESSNESS IN OUR REGION. YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND A CLIENT DELETED NOT GONNA SHARE SOME INFORMATION FROM YOU COUNTY.
