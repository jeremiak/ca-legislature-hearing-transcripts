TO TO CUT OVER THE BOOK OF

00:12:31.350 --> 00:12:33.152

BREAK IT INTO --

00:12:40.793 --> 00:12:41.927
SEPARATE BUSINESS FUNCTIONS AND

00:12:41.994 --> 00:12:44.130
ROLL IT ON ALLOWING FOR SOME

00:12:44.196 --> 00:12:45.965

00:12:53.072 --> 00:12:54.473
IS MAKING SENSE WITH THEIR WITH

00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:56.242
THEIR BOOK OF RECORD SO LIKE I

00:12:56.308 --> 00:12:57.443

00:13:00.479 --> 00:13:01.614
SCHEDULED TO RELEASE THE

THIS FISCAL YEAR AND AS

00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:09.922
INDICATED ON SLIDE ELEVEN AND IN

00:13:09.989 --> 00:13:11.423
SOME OF THE WRITE UPS OF

00:13:11.490 --> 00:13:13.425
OVERSIGHT ENTITIES WE ARE.

00:13:13.492 --> 00:13:17.163
CURRENTLY REVIEWING THE TIMELINE

00:13:17.229 --> 00:13:18.731
IN THE SCHEDULE.

00:13:18.797 --> 00:13:21.700
FOR THE DEPLOYMENT OF THE KAFFIR

00:13:21.767 --> 00:13:23.202
FUNCTIONALITY.

00:13:23.269 --> 00:13:25.204
AND I'M HAPPY TO TAKE ANY

00:13:25.271 --> 00:13:28.274
QUESTIONS.

00:13:28.340 --> 00:13:29.842
I HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS.

00:13:29.909 --> 00:13:32.378
REGARDING THE DELAYS --

00:13:32.444 --> 00:13:35.214
WILL THEY REQUIRE ANY ADDITIONAL

00:13:35.281 --> 00:13:36.715
APPROPRIATIONS.

00:13:36.782 --> 00:13:39.618
IMAM IN THIS BUDGET YEAR OR IN

00:13:39.685 --> 00:13:42.655
THE FUTURE AND SECOND --

00:13:42.721 --> 00:13:46.192
WILL ANY OF THE DELAYS --

00:13:46.258 --> 00:13:49.895
FOR CHALLENGES TO CLOSING OUT --

00:13:49.962 --> 00:13:51.530
MONTH OR YEAR AND REPORTS WILL

00:13:51.597 --> 00:13:54.166
THEY RESULT IN A NEGATIVE IMPACT.

00:13:54.233 --> 00:13:56.602
WITH REGARD TO OUR FINANCIAL

00:13:56.669 --> 00:13:58.204
STANDING.

00:13:58.270 --> 00:14:00.372
SO WITH X. WITH THAT TO YOUR

00:14:00.439 --> 00:14:02.341
FIRST QUESTION.

00:14:02.408 --> 00:14:04.510
WE ARE STILL IN THE ANALYSIS

00:14:04.577 --> 00:14:06.111
PHASES TO WHAT COMPONENTS WE

00:14:06.178 --> 00:14:07.446
WOULD NEED TO TO MOVE AND HOW

00:14:07.513 --> 00:14:08.847
MUCH THAT WILL COST.

00:14:08.914 --> 00:14:10.616
AGAIN THE THE TOTAL PROJECT WAS

00:14:10.683 --> 00:14:11.884
AT NINE HUNDRED AND EIGHTEEN

00:14:11.951 --> 00:14:13.652
MILLION DOLLARS WE SEE WE HAVE

00:14:13.719 --> 00:14:15.154
NOT COMPLETELY EXPENDED THOSE

00:14:15.221 --> 00:14:16.589
RESOURCES AS OF YET.

00:14:16.655 --> 00:14:17.756
SO WHATEVER ASKED WE WOULD COME

00:14:17.823 --> 00:14:20.025
TO THE LEDGE.

00:14:20.092 --> 00:14:22.528
IF IF THE NINETEEN DIDN'T COVER

00:14:22.595 --> 00:14:24.163
THOSE TOTAL EXPENDITURE SO IT'S

00:14:24.230 --> 00:14:25.798
IT'S TOO EARLY TO KNOW AT THIS

00:14:25.864 --> 00:14:27.233
POINT HOW MUCH --

00:14:27.299 --> 00:14:29.635
OR IF WE WOULD BE COMING BACK TO

00:14:29.702 --> 00:14:30.236
THE LEGISLATURE FOR ADDITIONAL

00:14:30.302 --> 00:14:31.437
RESOURCES --

00:14:31.503 --> 00:14:32.871
BUT WE EXPECT AGAIN THE STEERING

00:14:32.938 --> 00:14:34.106
COMMITTEE IS WORKING ON THIS

00:14:34.173 --> 00:14:35.941
ENDEAVOR RIGHT NOW AND SO IT IT

00:14:36.008 --> 00:14:37.376
WILL BE AND NOW.

00:14:37.443 --> 00:14:39.111
IN A MATTER OF A COUPLE OF

00:14:39.178 --> 00:14:40.946
MONTHS VERSUS YOU KNOW YEARS

00:14:41.013 --> 00:14:42.248
WILL WILL KNOW SHORTLY.

00:14:42.314 --> 00:14:44.049
WE ARE IMPLEMENTING THE PROJECT

00:14:44.116 --> 00:14:46.018
USING AN AGILE METHODOLOGY OR

00:14:46.085 --> 00:14:48.120
THE SPRINTS THIS LAST ASIO

00:14:48.187 --> 00:14:49.688
MILESTONE PIECES WHICH MEANS

00:14:49.755 --> 00:14:52.057
THAT WE MOVE THINGS FORWARD WHEN

00:14:52.124 --> 00:14:53.092
WHEN THEY'RE READY TO GO AND

00:14:53.158 --> 00:14:55.027
WE'VE PUSH THINGS OUT WHEN THEY

00:14:55.094 --> 00:14:57.196
NEED MORE TIME AGAIN FOCUSING ON

00:14:57.263 --> 00:14:58.564
THE QUALITY OF THE PRODUCT.

00:14:58.631 --> 00:15:02.101
GOING OUT SO THAT THE SYSTEM.

00:15:02.167 --> 00:15:03.936
DOESN'T PRESENT MORE ISSUES.

00:15:04.003 --> 00:15:05.771
THAN SAUCE NO WE NEED TO TO MAKE

00:15:05.838 --> 00:15:06.772
SURE THAT THE INFORMATION WE'RE

ACCURATE AND SECURE.

00:15:10.876 --> 00:15:12.344
SO THAT'S AN OPEN QUESTION.

00:15:12.411 --> 00:15:14.013
THEN THE SECOND PIECE WITH

00:15:14.079 --> 00:15:15.748
RESPECT TO THE DEPARTMENTS ARE

00:15:15.814 --> 00:15:17.816

THE I CAN'T SPEAK TO WHAT WE

00:15:22.621 --> 00:15:23.656
KNOW WHAT TYPE OF IMPACT THAT

00:15:23.722 --> 00:15:25.524
WOULD HAVE ON A CREDIT RATING

00:15:25.591 --> 00:15:27.393
FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BUT

00:15:27.459 --> 00:15:28.894
I CAN TELL YOU THAT.

00:15:28.961 --> 00:15:30.262
OF THE DEPARTMENTS THAT WERE IN

00:15:30.329 --> 00:15:31.297
THE SYSTEM.

00:15:31.363 --> 00:15:35.100
WE HAD ONLY FIFTEEN THAT ARE OUR

00:15:35.167 --> 00:15:35.901
HEAD.

00:15:35.968 --> 00:15:37.436
ESTIMATED STATEMENTS TO THE

00:15:37.503 --> 00:15:39.038

00:15:39.104 --> 00:15:45.577

GOES INTO YOUR BOND RATING AND

00:15:54.853 --> 00:15:56.855
AND THE STATE'S CREDIT RATING.

00:15:56.922 --> 00:15:58.257
VERY SIGNIFICANTLY.

00:15:58.324 --> 00:16:00.426
AND IF AND AGAIN THE TREASURE TO

00:16:00.492 --> 00:16:01.794
SPEAK TO THIS MUCH MORE

00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:03.495
ELOQUENTLY THAN I CAN BUT THE

00:16:03.562 --> 00:16:04.330

PROVIDED TO US INDICATED THAT.

00:16:06.932 --> 00:16:08.567
THE MAIN REASONS FOR ANY

00:16:08.634 --> 00:16:12.071
NEGATIVE MOVEMENT ON THE KAFFIR

00:16:12.137 --> 00:16:15.074
HAD BEEN BECAUSE OF LATE BUDGETS

00:16:15.140 --> 00:16:17.576
ECONOMIC INSTABILITY.

00:16:17.643 --> 00:16:21.246
OR AT SOME SORT OUT WHETHER

00:16:21.313 --> 00:16:22.414
VOTER PROPOSITIONS THAT WAS

00:16:22.481 --> 00:16:24.116
ANOTHER ONE WHERE YOU TAKE ADAM

00:16:24.183 --> 00:16:25.551
IF THERE'S A MAJOR INITIATIVE ON

00:16:25.617 --> 00:16:26.585
THE BALLOT THAT.

00:16:26.652 --> 00:16:28.921
IS ALLOCATING SPENDING THOSE AT

00:16:28.987 --> 00:16:30.689
THOSE PERIODS OF TIMES WE'VE

00:16:30.756 --> 00:16:32.257
SEEN A NEGATIVE IMPACT.

00:16:32.324 --> 00:16:33.592
OF COURSE YOU KNOW THE THE THE

00:16:33.659 --> 00:16:36.729
GLOBAL RECESSION THAT WE HAD AND

00:16:36.795 --> 00:16:38.263
WAS THE LAST TIME THAT THAT THIS

00:16:38.330 --> 00:16:39.631
WAS IMPACTED.

00:16:39.698 --> 00:16:41.033
WE HAVE PRODUCED TO ESTIMATED

00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:43.769
STATEMENTS BEFORE IN THE PAST.

00:16:43.836 --> 00:16:45.637
THOSE DID NOT RESULT IN NEGATIVE

00:16:45.704 --> 00:16:47.940
DOWNGRADES BUT AGAIN.

00:16:48.006 --> 00:16:50.976
THAT'S ALL ANECDOTAL WHAT THE

00:16:51.043 --> 00:16:53.112
HISTORY AS IT IS ABSOLUTELY

00:16:53.178 --> 00:16:54.646
IMPORTANT TO PROVIDE THE MOST

00:16:54.713 --> 00:16:58.050
ACCURATE FINANCIAL RECORDS TO

00:16:58.117 --> 00:16:59.818
ADD TO THE CITIZENS AS WELL AS

00:16:59.885 --> 00:17:01.086
TO THOSE THAT ARE INVESTING IN

00:17:01.153 --> 00:17:02.488
CALIFORNIA BONDS.

00:17:02.554 --> 00:17:05.324
AND THAT IS WHAT FISKE OUT IS IS

00:17:05.391 --> 00:17:08.060
REALLY STRIVING TO DO SO WE ARE

00:17:08.127 --> 00:17:09.795
WORKING WITH THOSE DEPARTMENTS --

00:17:09.862 --> 00:17:11.463
WE HAVE RESOURCES THAT ARE ARE

00:17:11.530 --> 00:17:15.100
SPENDING MORE TIME WITH THEM --

00:17:15.167 --> 00:17:16.935
INCLUDING THE ON BOARDING OF AS

00:17:17.002 --> 00:17:18.270
YOU KNOW SOME CONTRA REDIRECTING

00:17:18.337 --> 00:17:20.272
SOME OF MY CONTRACTOR STAFF TO

00:17:20.339 --> 00:17:21.573
WORK WITH THESE DEPARTMENTS

00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:23.108
ESPECIALLY THOSE THAT ARE THE

00:17:23.175 --> 00:17:24.276
MOST MATERIAL FOR THE STATE OF

00:17:24.343 --> 00:17:25.844
ALIFORNIA TO MAKE SURE.

00:17:25.911 --> 00:17:28.714
THAT THEIR BOOKS ARE CLOSING ON

00:17:28.781 --> 00:17:30.416
TIME. ONE OF THE KEY FACTORS FOR

00:17:30.482 --> 00:17:32.084
THE DEPARTMENTS TO CLOSE.

00:17:32.151 --> 00:17:33.051
IS.

00:17:33.118 --> 00:17:35.320
AT EDUCATION AND MAKING SURE

00:17:35.387 --> 00:17:36.755
THAT THEIR UNDERSTANDING THE NEW

00:17:36.822 --> 00:17:37.923
SYSTEM WE WENT FROM A

00:17:37.990 --> 00:17:40.125
TRANSACTIONAL I SYSTEM WHICH WAS

00:17:40.192 --> 00:17:41.160
MOSTLY CAL STARS MISS IT

00:17:41.226 --> 00:17:43.061
APARTMENTS WERE ON THE CAL STARS

00:17:43.128 --> 00:17:44.630
TRANSACTIONAL SYSTEM. TO TRUE

00:17:44.696 --> 00:17:46.231
ACCOUNTING SYSTEM AND SO THERE

00:17:46.298 --> 00:17:47.599
IS A LEARNING CURVE FOR THE

00:17:47.666 --> 00:17:49.368
DEPARTMENTS TO UNDERSTAND HOW TO

00:17:49.435 --> 00:17:50.402
ENTER.

00:17:50.469 --> 00:17:52.404

IN THE PROPER LEDGERS.

00:17:54.873 --> 00:17:57.743
AND SO THAT IS AN ONGOING EFFORT

00:17:57.810 --> 00:17:59.545
THAT WE HAVE IN PARTNERSHIP WITH

00:17:59.611 --> 00:18:01.713

00:18:15.060 --> 00:18:16.495
TOO SMALL.

00:18:16.562 --> 00:18:18.430
OR IF THEY HAVE SEPARATION OF

00:18:18.497 --> 00:18:19.731
DUTIES ISSUES WITHIN A NEW.

00:18:19.798 --> 00:18:21.667

00:21:17.242 --> 00:21:19.077
ONLINE TO FISCAL --

00:21:19.144 --> 00:21:21.446
BUT ARE NOT CAPTURED IN PROJECT

00:21:21.513 --> 00:21:23.081
COST CURRENTLY --

00:21:23.148 --> 00:21:24.016
AND WOULD HAVE TO SUBMIT

00:21:24.082 --> 00:21:26.485
INDIVIDUAL BUDGET REQUESTS TO

00:21:26.551 --> 00:21:27.686
LATER COME ON FISCAL --

00:21:27.753 --> 00:21:29.287
AND WE WOULD ALSO NOTE AGAIN

00:21:29.354 --> 00:21:30.722
KIND OF THE CHALLENGES THAT THE

00:21:30.789 --> 00:21:32.290
DEPARTMENTS ALREADY FACING WITH

00:21:32.357 --> 00:21:34.559
MONTH AND IN YOUR AND CLOSE --

00:21:34.626 --> 00:21:35.961
DID APART AS THE DIRECTOR

00:21:36.028 --> 00:21:37.362
MENTIONED FIFTEEN HAD TO SUBMIT

00:21:37.429 --> 00:21:40.065
ESTIMATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

00:21:40.132 --> 00:21:40.666
FOR SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN ARE THE

00:21:40.732 --> 00:21:42.300
DEPARTMENT SAID CAME ONLINE IN

00:21:42.367 --> 00:21:44.202
JULY OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN ARE MUCH

00:21:44.269 --> 00:21:45.070
LARGER --

00:21:45.137 --> 00:21:47.072
AND SO THE RISK OF NOT CLOSING

00:21:47.139 --> 00:21:48.206
THOSE MONTH AND IN YOUR AND

00:21:48.273 --> 00:21:50.008
STATEMENTS ON TIME --

00:21:50.075 --> 00:21:54.012
COULD BE GREATER FOR THE STATE --

00:21:54.079 --> 00:21:54.646
AND SO WITH THAT HAPPY TO ANSWER

00:21:54.713 --> 00:21:56.181
QUESTIONS [inaudible]

00:21:56.248 --> 00:21:58.417
THANK YOU.

00:21:58.483 --> 00:22:00.318
LET ME A IN I'M.

00:22:00.385 --> 00:22:01.586
TURN TEMPORARILY WHERE THE

00:22:01.653 --> 00:22:04.623
CHAIRS AND IN ANOTHER MEETING.

00:22:04.690 --> 00:22:08.026
THIS IS A MAYBE PEOPLE TECH KIND

00:22:08.093 --> 00:22:10.095
OF INNOCUOUS AREA FORCED

00:22:10.162 --> 00:22:11.730
SUBCOMMITTEE.

00:22:11.797 --> 00:22:14.866
AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY YOU

00:22:14.933 --> 00:22:16.568
KNOW WE DON'T THINK ABOUT MUCH.

00:22:16.635 --> 00:22:18.770
BUT I SUBMIT I'VE BEEN FOLLOWING

00:22:18.837 --> 00:22:20.439
THIS FOR MANY YEARS.

00:22:20.505 --> 00:22:23.508
EVEN AS A CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD

00:22:23.575 --> 00:22:24.509
PRISON TERM FOR MANY YEARS WERE.

00:22:24.576 --> 00:22:26.645
DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS WAS

00:22:26.712 --> 00:22:29.081
IMPLEMENTING A WHOLE NEW SYSTEM.

00:22:29.147 --> 00:22:30.816
IT'S NOT A VERY GOOD RECORD FOR

00:22:30.882 --> 00:22:32.651
THE STATE THAT PRIDES ITSELF AN

00:22:32.718 --> 00:22:34.853
ITCH TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES AND

00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:36.421
LEADERSHIP.

00:22:36.488 --> 00:22:38.023
IN FACT TO THE CONTRARY IT'S A

00:22:38.090 --> 00:22:39.825
DISGRACE.

00:22:39.891 --> 00:22:41.593
ALMOST ALL OF OUR MAJOR TECH

00:22:41.660 --> 00:22:43.462
PROJECTS HAVE BEEN WAY OVER

00:22:43.528 --> 00:22:44.830
BUDGET.

00:22:44.896 --> 00:22:47.165
AND THEY'VE CRASHED [inaudible]

00:22:47.232 --> 00:22:48.934
VERY FEW.

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:50.936
CAN WE EVER SAY.

00:22:51.002 --> 00:22:51.570
HAVE SERVE THE INTERESTS OF THE

00:22:51.636 --> 00:22:53.605
PEOPLE.

00:22:53.672 --> 00:22:56.942
AND THAT'S NOT TOLERABLE ANYMORE.

00:22:57.008 --> 00:22:58.076
AND I WOULD.

00:22:58.143 --> 00:22:59.878
SET FOR THE RECORD THE

00:22:59.945 --> 00:23:01.813
OBSERVATIONS OF THE LA ALL RIGHT

00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:02.981
NOW.

00:23:03.048 --> 00:23:04.716
ARE ABSOLUTELY.

00:23:04.783 --> 00:23:06.084
ISSUES THAT I'M GOING TO BE.

00:23:06.151 --> 00:23:07.619
STAYING ON FOR THE REST OF MY

00:23:07.686 --> 00:23:09.588
CAREER.

00:23:09.654 --> 00:23:11.990
BECAUSE AGAIN WE'VE SQUANDERED

00:23:12.057 --> 00:23:15.627
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS.

00:23:15.694 --> 00:23:18.196
AND I'M I'M NOT COMFORTABLE.

00:23:18.263 --> 00:23:21.032
WITH IMPLEMENTING A NEW PROCESS.

00:23:21.099 --> 00:23:22.601
BEFORE WE EVEN UNDERSTAND THE

00:23:22.667 --> 00:23:25.203
PROCESS.

00:23:25.270 --> 00:23:26.505
AND WE'RE AND I FEAR THAT THE

00:23:26.571 --> 00:23:28.507
LEGISLATURE WOULD BE ADVOCATING

00:23:28.573 --> 00:23:31.409
EVEN MORE OF OUR RESPONSIBILITY

00:23:31.476 --> 00:23:34.146
AND AUTHORITY FOR OVERSIGHT.

00:23:34.212 --> 00:23:35.747
IT STARTED OUT BEING SOMETHING

00:23:35.814 --> 00:23:36.982
CALLED AND I BLACKED OUT OF

00:23:37.048 --> 00:23:38.683
KUWAIT OFFICE OF INFORMATION

00:23:38.750 --> 00:23:41.620
TECHNOLOGY AND I GUESS IT'S NOW

00:23:41.686 --> 00:23:42.554
DO IT I THINK RIGHT.

00:23:42.621 --> 00:23:44.156
IT'S THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT

00:23:44.222 --> 00:23:47.058
OF TECHNOLOGY YEAH THAT WELL.

00:23:47.125 --> 00:23:48.360
NOW THIS DEBT.

00:23:48.426 --> 00:23:50.529
AB CHANGE MANY TIMES THAT BUT

00:23:50.595 --> 00:23:52.097
THAT IS NOT MY POINT.

00:23:52.164 --> 00:23:55.867
THE CHANGING AND MAJOR DECISIONS.

00:23:55.934 --> 00:23:57.435
THE ISSUE RELATED TO MILESTONES

00:23:57.502 --> 00:24:00.472
IS CRITICAL.

00:24:00.539 --> 00:24:02.107
AND WE JUST CANNOT.

00:24:02.174 --> 00:24:04.609
HAVE THAT INTIMATE [inaudible]

00:24:04.676 --> 00:24:06.545
OVERSIGHT.

00:24:06.611 --> 00:24:07.612
OF ALL THE TECHNOLOGICAL

00:24:07.679 --> 00:24:10.749
APPLICATIONS AGENCY BY AGENCY.

00:24:10.816 --> 00:24:13.185
AND THE MAGNITUDE OF WHAT YOU'RE

00:24:13.251 --> 00:24:14.519
TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH NOW.

00:24:14.586 --> 00:24:16.054
WITH THE NUMBERS OF AGENCIES

00:24:16.121 --> 00:24:19.925
COMING ON LINE OR PREPARING.

00:24:19.991 --> 00:24:20.692
TO UP.

00:24:20.759 --> 00:24:23.528
WE NEED EVEN BETTER OVERSIGHT

00:24:23.595 --> 00:24:25.730
THAN MILESTONES.

00:24:25.797 --> 00:24:27.899
WHAT WOULD YOU SUGGEST THAT

00:24:27.966 --> 00:24:30.802
YOU'RE LOOKING AT THAT WOULD BE

00:24:30.869 --> 00:24:31.102
[inaudible]

00:24:31.169 --> 00:24:33.471
FISCAL DISCIPLINES.

00:24:33.538 --> 00:24:35.841
IF YOU WILL EVEN PENALTIES.

00:24:35.907 --> 00:24:37.275
IF CONTRACTORS.

00:24:37.342 --> 00:24:38.243
ARE NOT.

00:24:38.310 --> 00:24:40.145
COMPLETING THE JOB OR IF YOUR

00:24:40.212 --> 00:24:41.580
DEPARTMENT IS NOT.

00:24:41.646 --> 00:24:43.548
COMPLETING ITS WORK.

00:24:43.615 --> 00:24:44.382
IN A TIMELY MANNER.

00:24:44.449 --> 00:24:46.384
THEN ON BUDGET.

00:24:46.451 --> 00:24:48.587
WHAT SHOULD WE THE LEGISLATURE

00:24:48.653 --> 00:24:51.256
DUE TO ENSURE THE OVERSIGHT?

00:24:51.323 --> 00:24:53.291
AND CONSEQUENCES FOR THESE

00:24:53.358 --> 00:24:59.197
CONTINUED THE LACE AND OVERRIDES.

00:24:59.264 --> 00:25:00.966
THERE IS A LOT IN ALL OF THAT.

00:25:01.032 --> 00:25:02.267
A LOT BUT IT'S IT'S A CRITICAL

00:25:02.334 --> 00:25:03.935
ERROR IT IT ABSOLUTELY ALIENS

00:25:04.002 --> 00:25:05.237
AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND IT'S

00:25:05.303 --> 00:25:06.504
AN EMBARRASSMENT.

00:25:06.571 --> 00:25:10.742
THE CALIFORNIA WE NEED TO PUT A

00:25:10.809 --> 00:25:11.276
STAUNCH THE BLEEDING HERE

00:25:11.343 --> 00:25:11.576
[inaudible]

00:25:11.643 --> 00:25:13.211
SO.

00:25:13.278 --> 00:25:14.512
THIS SYSTEM DOES MANAGE

00:25:14.579 --> 00:25:16.381
CURRENTLY TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY

00:25:16.448 --> 00:25:17.983
THREE BILLION DOLLARS OF

00:25:18.049 --> 00:25:19.718
EXPENDITURES THROUGH THE SYSTEM.

00:25:19.784 --> 00:25:22.420
IT DOES CURRENTLY MANAGE THE TWO

00:25:22.487 --> 00:25:24.289
TRILLION DOLLARS IN BANKING.

00:25:24.356 --> 00:25:26.024
THE DEPARTMENTS CONTINUE TO

00:25:26.091 --> 00:25:29.327
STRUGGLE AND WE RECOGNIZE THAT.

00:25:29.394 --> 00:25:30.996
BUT THAT DOES NOT MEAN THAT THEY

00:25:31.062 --> 00:25:32.831
ARE NOT BEING ABLE. TO TO PAY

00:25:32.898 --> 00:25:34.332
THEIR BILLS TO FUNCTION AND TO

00:25:34.399 --> 00:25:35.433
DO THEIR WORK AND THAT IS ALWAYS

00:25:35.500 --> 00:25:37.469
WHAT IS KEY FOR US AS WELL AS MY

00:25:37.535 --> 00:25:38.436
FOR PARTNERS.

00:25:38.503 --> 00:25:39.537
SO IF YOU DEPARTMENT IS COMING

00:25:39.604 --> 00:25:40.939
ACROSS AN ISSUE WE WORK

00:25:41.006 --> 00:25:42.874
SPECIFICALLY WITH THEM. TO MAKE

00:25:42.941 --> 00:25:44.242
SURE THAT --

00:25:44.309 --> 00:25:46.211
CRITICAL LIKE FIRE SAFETY ALL OF

00:25:46.278 --> 00:25:46.845
THOSE ISSUES THAT THE

00:25:46.912 --> 00:25:47.712
DEPARTMENTS DEAL WITH THAT WE'RE

00:25:47.779 --> 00:25:49.915
ABLE TO GET THOSE PAYMENTS AND

00:25:49.981 --> 00:25:50.248
EXPENDITURES.

00:25:50.315 --> 00:25:51.249
OUT THE DOOR --

00:25:51.316 --> 00:25:54.886
THAT IS THE WE CANNOT STOP THE

00:25:54.953 --> 00:25:56.054
STATE OF CALIFORNIA FROM

00:25:56.121 --> 00:25:57.222
CONSERVING THE PEOPLE

00:25:57.289 --> 00:25:57.522
[inaudible]

00:25:57.589 --> 00:26:01.059
THE I'M WITH RESPECT TO THE TO

00:26:01.126 --> 00:26:02.460
THE BUDGET THE BUDGET AND SCOPE

00:26:02.527 --> 00:26:05.030
OF THE OF THIS PROJECT HAS SWUNG

00:26:05.096 --> 00:26:05.830
SIGNIFICANTLY.

00:26:05.897 --> 00:26:07.799
WE STARTED OFF AT A HUNDRED AND

00:26:07.866 --> 00:26:09.200
FORTY MILLION DOLLAR PROJECT

00:26:09.267 --> 00:26:10.702
WHEN WE WERE JUST THE BUDGETING

00:26:10.769 --> 00:26:12.470
SYSTEM SO THAT WAS THE FIRST.

00:26:12.537 --> 00:26:13.171
ESTIMATE THAT THE LEGISLATURE

00:26:13.238 --> 00:26:15.373
HAD WE WENT UP AS HIGH AS ONE

00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:17.609
POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS.

00:26:17.676 --> 00:26:19.344
AND WE ARE CURRENTLY AT NINE

00:26:19.411 --> 00:26:20.612
HUNDRED AND EIGHTEEN THOSE

00:26:20.679 --> 00:26:22.414
CHANGES HAPPEN BECAUSE WE'VE

00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:24.950
INCREASED OR DECREASED SCOPE

00:26:25.016 --> 00:26:26.384
OVER OVER THE YEARS.

00:26:26.451 --> 00:26:28.086
AND PART OF THAT HAS OCCURRED

00:26:28.153 --> 00:26:30.922
BECAUSE IT IS A LONG PROJECT SO

00:26:30.989 --> 00:26:32.257
THINGS THAT WE DECIDED THAT WE

00:26:32.324 --> 00:26:33.892
WERE GOING TO NEED IN TWO

00:26:33.959 --> 00:26:34.659
THOUSAND SEVEN AND A CERTAIN WAY

00:26:34.726 --> 00:26:35.660
OF DOING IT.

00:26:35.727 --> 00:26:37.329
AREN'T NECESSARILY.

00:26:37.395 --> 00:26:39.664
WHAT WE NEEDED IN IN TWENTY

00:26:39.731 --> 00:26:40.165
FOURTEEN WHEN WE STARTED

00:26:40.231 --> 00:26:40.832
DEPLOYING?

00:26:40.899 --> 00:26:43.034
SO WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO MAKE

00:26:43.101 --> 00:26:44.869
THROUGH THE THE AMENDMENT

00:26:44.936 --> 00:26:46.571
PROCESS THROUGH THE SPR

00:26:46.638 --> 00:26:49.541
PROCESSOR OR THROUGH THE UPDATE

00:26:49.607 --> 00:26:52.677
PROCESS THAT THE CITY IS

00:26:52.744 --> 00:26:52.944
PROPOSING.

00:26:53.011 --> 00:26:54.379
THAT.

00:26:54.446 --> 00:26:55.880
WE GO IN AND AND WE ARE MAKING

00:26:55.947 --> 00:26:57.582
SURE THAT.

00:26:57.649 --> 00:26:59.284
WHAT WE'RE SPENDING THE TAXPAYER

00:26:59.351 --> 00:27:01.353
DOLLARS ON STILL MAKE SENSE AND

00:27:01.419 --> 00:27:02.487
IF IT DOESN'T THEN WE TAKE THAT

00:27:02.554 --> 00:27:04.089
OUT AND WE REMOVE IT FROM THE

00:27:04.155 --> 00:27:04.789
SCOUT?

00:27:04.856 --> 00:27:06.858
AND SO THAT HAS BEEN THE HISTORY

00:27:06.925 --> 00:27:08.159
ON THIS PROJECT SO.

00:27:08.226 --> 00:27:09.327
IT.

00:27:09.394 --> 00:27:11.062
IT HAS HAD TO COME BEFORE THE

00:27:11.129 --> 00:27:14.699
LEGISLATURE SEVERAL TIMES ASKING --

00:27:14.766 --> 00:27:15.300
FOR CHANGES TO ITS SCOPE AND

00:27:15.367 --> 00:27:17.168
SCHEDULE BUT AGAIN IT IS TO

00:27:17.235 --> 00:27:19.037
PRODUCE THAT PRODUCT THAT WILL

00:27:19.104 --> 00:27:21.106
PROVIDE ACCURATE INFORMATION AND

00:27:21.172 --> 00:27:22.807
THAT TRANSPARENCY THAT THE

00:27:22.874 --> 00:27:23.608
DEPARTMENT --

00:27:23.675 --> 00:27:25.176
HAT THE LEGISLATURE NEEDS THAT

00:27:25.243 --> 00:27:26.678
THE PUBLIC NEEDS AND THAT THE

00:27:26.745 --> 00:27:28.380
DEPARTMENT CAN UTILIZE TO BETTER

00:27:28.446 --> 00:27:30.248
MANAGE THEIR OWN PROGRAMS.

00:27:30.315 --> 00:27:31.616
SO.

00:27:31.683 --> 00:27:32.217
I WOULD ARGUE THAT YOU KNOW

00:27:32.283 --> 00:27:34.452
HAVING FOUR THOUSAND OF THE

00:27:34.519 --> 00:27:35.453
FORTY TWO HUNDRED REQUIREMENTS

00:27:35.520 --> 00:27:36.855
ALREADY IN PLACE.

00:27:36.921 --> 00:27:37.989
IS IS.

00:27:38.056 --> 00:27:39.524
REALLY AN INDICATION THAT THE

00:27:39.591 --> 00:27:43.495
PROJECT IS SUCCESSFUL WHAT.

00:27:43.561 --> 00:27:44.796
IT MAKES IT MORE CHALLENGING AND

00:27:44.863 --> 00:27:46.064
MORE DIFFICULT IS AN

00:27:46.131 --> 00:27:47.132
IMPLEMENTATION IN THE CHANGE

00:27:47.198 --> 00:27:48.600
MANAGEMENT PIECE.

00:27:48.666 --> 00:27:51.102
THE CHANGE MANAGEMENT KEYS.

00:27:51.169 --> 00:27:51.836
IS THE HARDEST PART --

00:27:51.903 --> 00:27:54.973
WE WE CHANGE FUNDAMENTALLY

00:27:55.040 --> 00:27:56.541
CHANGE THE WAY CALIFORNIA DOES

00:27:56.608 --> 00:27:57.675
BUSINESS.

00:27:57.742 --> 00:28:00.912
AND THAT MEANS THAT EIGHTEEN

00:28:00.979 --> 00:28:01.513
THOUSAND STATE EMPLOYEES HAVE

00:28:01.579 --> 00:28:02.547
HAD.

00:28:02.614 --> 00:28:04.516
TO DO THEIR JOBS DIFFERENTLY.

00:28:04.582 --> 00:28:06.351
I THERE ARE THINGS THAT WERE

00:28:06.418 --> 00:28:08.186
REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE

00:28:08.253 --> 00:28:09.687
REQUIREMENTS AND POLICY.

00:28:09.754 --> 00:28:11.356
AS WELL AS REGULATION THAT THE

00:28:11.423 --> 00:28:13.191
DEPARTMENTS WERE EXPECTED TO

00:28:13.258 --> 00:28:14.993
COMPLY WITH.

00:28:15.060 --> 00:28:19.464
THAT FISCAL SYSTEM. EIGHT IF YOU

00:28:19.531 --> 00:28:20.799
WERE UNAWARE OF IT YOU'RE NEW TO

00:28:20.865 --> 00:28:22.400
THE STATE YOU DIDN'T KNOW THAT

00:28:22.467 --> 00:28:22.967
YOU HAD TO GO THROUGH THIS

00:28:23.034 --> 00:28:23.935
HURDLE OR THAT HURDLE.

00:28:24.002 --> 00:28:25.570
YOU CANNOT PROCEED IN THE SYSTEM

00:28:25.637 --> 00:28:27.272
UNTIL YOU'VE FULLY COMPLIED WITH

00:28:27.338 --> 00:28:28.373
THE POLICIES THAT HAVE BEEN

00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:28.706
BUILT.

00:28:28.773 --> 00:28:30.642
INTO THE SYSTEM SO IT DOES

00:28:30.708 --> 00:28:31.810
PROVIDE.

00:28:31.876 --> 00:28:33.378
A MORE.

00:28:33.445 --> 00:28:34.412
ACCURATE.

00:28:34.479 --> 00:28:36.448
ACCOUNTING SYSTEM IT IS HARDER

00:28:36.514 --> 00:28:37.949
FOR DEPARTMENTS BECAUSE OF THAT

00:28:38.016 --> 00:28:39.084
THINGS THAT THEY WERE ABLE TO

00:28:39.150 --> 00:28:47.926
RECONCILE TWO MONTHS.

00:28:47.992 --> 00:28:49.594
DO THEIR BUDGETS AND SO IT IS

00:28:49.661 --> 00:28:51.096
MORE THAN JUST THE

00:28:51.162 --> 00:28:52.130
IMPLEMENTATION OF OF THE

00:28:52.197 --> 00:28:54.532
TECHNOLOGY IT'S WHAT THAT.

00:28:54.599 --> 00:28:57.202
TECHNOLOGY MEANS TO THE IT TO

00:28:57.268 --> 00:28:59.137
THEIR DAY TO DAY WORK AND AGAIN

00:28:59.204 --> 00:29:02.507
I I FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT THE

00:29:02.574 --> 00:29:03.875
INFORMATION THE DEPARTMENTS ARE

00:29:03.942 --> 00:29:05.143
BEING REQUIRED TO PUT INTO THE

00:29:05.210 --> 00:29:07.312
SYSTEM.

00:29:07.378 --> 00:29:08.513
IS MORE DETAILED.

00:29:08.580 --> 00:29:09.814
THEREFORE LEADING TO MORE

00:29:09.881 --> 00:29:11.416
TRANSPARENCY BUT ON THE FLIP

00:29:11.483 --> 00:29:13.384
SIDE OF THAT YOU DO HAVE THAT

00:29:13.451 --> 00:29:15.120
LEARNING CURVE ON AND HOW YOU

00:29:15.186 --> 00:29:16.788
YOU GO ABOUT DOING THAT.

00:29:16.855 --> 00:29:18.823
IT'S ABSOLUTELY A HUGE

00:29:18.890 --> 00:29:20.992
UNDERTAKING WE ARE THE LARGEST

00:29:21.059 --> 00:29:23.761
FINANCIAL ERP SYSTEM --

00:29:23.828 --> 00:29:24.629
IN THE POT IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR

00:29:24.696 --> 00:29:28.166
AND I WOULD ARGUE IN IN THE

00:29:28.233 --> 00:29:28.766
WORLD GIVEN WHERE MUCH LARGER

00:29:28.833 --> 00:29:30.368
THAN ANY --

00:29:30.435 --> 00:29:31.870
IS SO IT.

00:29:31.936 --> 00:29:33.371
IT'S SOMETHING THAT WHILE WE CAN

00:29:33.438 --> 00:29:34.672
LOOK TO OTHER STATES OR OTHER

00:29:34.739 --> 00:29:36.040
COUNTRIES AND AND HOW THEY'VE

00:29:36.107 --> 00:29:37.709
IMPLEMENTED IT WE ARE UNIQUELY

00:29:37.775 --> 00:29:40.378
CALIFORNIAN AND WE HAVE.

00:29:40.445 --> 00:29:42.013
OUR LAWS AND OUR STRUCTURES THAT

00:29:42.080 --> 00:29:43.748
HAVE ADDED TO THE COMPLEXITY OF

00:29:43.815 --> 00:29:44.983
THIS IMPLEMENTATION AND FOR THE

00:29:45.049 --> 00:29:46.151
DEPARTMENTS.

00:29:46.217 --> 00:29:48.153
SO WELL I DON'T WANT TO SAY THAT

00:29:48.219 --> 00:29:50.088
IT ISN'T A DIFFICULT FOR THE

00:29:50.155 --> 00:29:51.589
DEPARTMENTS I ALSO WANT TO MAKE

00:29:51.656 --> 00:29:52.957
SURE THAT --

00:29:53.024 --> 00:29:55.894
IT IS RECOGNIZED THAT THIS.

00:29:55.960 --> 00:29:57.662
EFFORT HAS BEEN.

00:29:57.729 --> 00:29:59.564
THOUGHTFUL METHODICAL IT HAS

00:29:59.631 --> 00:30:00.899
BEEN SLOW BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN

00:30:00.965 --> 00:30:02.400
TRYING TO DO IT RIGHT WE DON'T

00:30:02.467 --> 00:30:04.102
WANT TO IMPLEMENT TECHNOLOGY.

00:30:04.169 --> 00:30:05.069
TODAY THAT IS GOING TO BE YOU

00:30:05.136 --> 00:30:08.106
KNOW OUT OBSOLETE BY THE TIME

00:30:08.173 --> 00:30:09.474
FOR FULLY UTILIZING.

00:30:09.541 --> 00:30:11.075
ALL OF THE DEPARTMENTS ARE

00:30:11.142 --> 00:30:12.977
UTILIZING THE FISCAL SYSTEM

00:30:13.044 --> 00:30:15.013
THERE ARE VERY FEW THERE'S

00:30:15.079 --> 00:30:18.016
EIGHTEEN BETTER CURVE --

00:30:18.082 --> 00:30:19.017
CALENDARS AT THIS --

00:30:19.083 --> 00:30:21.519
CALENDARS AT CAL STARS SORRY --

00:30:21.586 --> 00:30:22.854
THEY THE LEGACY ACCOUNTING

00:30:22.921 --> 00:30:24.489
SYSTEM SOME OF THAT IS FOR THE

00:30:24.556 --> 00:30:25.857
FEDERAL REPORTING REQUIREMENTS

00:30:25.924 --> 00:30:26.925
THAT WE'RE STILL CAN WE STILL

00:30:26.991 --> 00:30:28.826
WORK ON THERE'S ABOUT. SIX OR

00:30:28.893 --> 00:30:30.495
EIGHT OF THOSE DEPARTMENTS.

00:30:30.562 --> 00:30:32.497
AND MOST OF THE OTHERS THAT ARE

00:30:32.564 --> 00:30:34.599
UTILIZING BOTH SYSTEMS IT'S TO

00:30:34.666 --> 00:30:36.067
DO SOME VALIDATION OF SOME OF

00:30:36.134 --> 00:30:37.435
THE LAST.

00:30:37.502 --> 00:30:38.570
RELEASE ENHANCEMENT SO WE'VE

00:30:38.636 --> 00:30:39.637
DONE SOME MOST OF THOSE

00:30:39.704 --> 00:30:40.939
DEPARTMENTS WILL BE COMING OFF

00:30:41.005 --> 00:30:42.540
OF THEIR GROUPS ARE EXPECTED TO

00:30:42.607 --> 00:30:43.741
COME OFF OF CAL STARS.

00:30:43.808 --> 00:30:46.010
AT THE END OF MARCH SO IT'S IF

00:30:46.077 --> 00:30:49.080
THEY'RE NOT DOING TO COMPLETE.

00:30:49.147 --> 00:30:51.482
DUPLICATE SYSTEMS IT'S REALLY

00:30:51.549 --> 00:30:52.617
SOME OF THEM ARE USING CAL START

00:30:52.684 --> 00:30:54.152
TO DO SOME OF THE REPORTING THAT

00:30:54.219 --> 00:30:54.986
THEY CAN'T GET OUT OF THE FISCAL

00:30:55.053 --> 00:30:55.920
SYSTEM.

00:30:55.987 --> 00:30:58.957
SUMMER DOING I USING IT --

00:30:59.023 --> 00:31:00.491
FOR PAYMENT TO FOREIGN VENDORS

00:31:00.558 --> 00:31:02.260
BECAUSE AGAIN THAT'S AN AREA

00:31:02.327 --> 00:31:06.264
THAT WE'RE STILL WORKING ON IT

00:31:06.331 --> 00:31:07.532
WITH OUR PARTNERS --

00:31:07.599 --> 00:31:09.534
BUT FOR THE FOR THE BULK OF THE

00:31:09.601 --> 00:31:10.702
TRANSACTIONS IN THE BULK OF THE

00:31:10.768 --> 00:31:12.503
DOLLARS THAT ARE BEING SPENT BY

00:31:12.570 --> 00:31:13.104
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THERE

00:31:13.171 --> 00:31:14.706
ARE.

00:31:14.772 --> 00:31:15.373
FOREIGN TRACKED WITHIN OUR

00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:16.908
SYSTEM WELL YOU TRACKING BUT

00:31:16.975 --> 00:31:18.509
THERE ARE NO CONSEQUENCES WHAT

00:31:18.576 --> 00:31:21.012
ARE THE CONSEQUENCES FOR THESE

00:31:21.079 --> 00:31:22.247
CONTINUED DELAYS.

00:31:22.313 --> 00:31:23.715
I WANT TO GET THAT BACK TO THE

00:31:23.781 --> 00:31:25.550
LEGISLATURE WHERE WE CAN THEN

00:31:25.617 --> 00:31:27.585
EFFECT CONSEQUENCES.

00:31:27.652 --> 00:31:29.554
THAT THERE SOME KIND OF PENALTY.

00:31:29.621 --> 00:31:31.489
TO THE CONTRACTOR.

00:31:31.556 --> 00:31:33.358
OR TO THE DEPARTMENTS THEY THEY

00:31:33.424 --> 00:31:35.059
CAN'T JUST KEEP DOING THIS AND

00:31:35.126 --> 00:31:36.694
I'M NOT COMFORTABLE BUT YOU'VE

00:31:36.761 --> 00:31:38.529
GOT ANY MECHANISMS IN THERE. TO

00:31:38.596 --> 00:31:39.831
MAKE THEM REALLY ACCOUNTABLE

00:31:39.897 --> 00:31:41.199
MAYBE IT'S A LITTLE BIT MORE

00:31:41.266 --> 00:31:42.634
TRANSPARENT THAT IS STILL

00:31:42.700 --> 00:31:44.302
ACTIVITIES THIS PROCESS IS THAT

00:31:44.369 --> 00:31:44.969
YOU'RE.

00:31:45.036 --> 00:31:46.404
DEALING WITH NOW IS GOING TO

00:31:46.471 --> 00:31:48.306
EVEN GIVE US A LET LESSER

00:31:48.373 --> 00:31:50.842
ABILITY TO OVERSEE AND IMPLEMENT

00:31:50.908 --> 00:31:52.043
CONSEQUENCES WHAT ARE THE

00:31:52.110 --> 00:31:53.811
CONSEQUENCES FOR THE CONTINUED

00:31:53.878 --> 00:31:54.379
FAILURES.

00:31:54.445 --> 00:31:55.747
SO THERE ARE CONTRACT

00:31:55.813 --> 00:31:57.815
CONTRACTUAL CONSEQUENCES FOR

00:31:57.882 --> 00:31:59.917
EXTENSION OKAY DO YOU EVER

00:31:59.984 --> 00:32:01.452
EMPLOYED THE YES WE HAVE AND I

00:32:01.519 --> 00:32:03.855
CAN PHONE A FRIEND IF YOU WANT

00:32:03.921 --> 00:32:04.589
TO KNOW HOW MUCH THAT.

00:32:04.656 --> 00:32:05.590
JUST YOU KNOW THAT YOU HAVE

00:32:05.657 --> 00:32:07.091
BECAUSE WE HAVE WE ABSOLUTELY

00:32:07.158 --> 00:32:08.192
HAVE TO AS IT COSTS THESE

00:32:08.259 --> 00:32:09.594
BUSINESSES SUBSTANTIAL MONEY I

00:32:09.661 --> 00:32:12.297
HOPE AT I WOULD IMAGINE SO.

00:32:12.363 --> 00:32:14.098
ON ABOUT THE STATE AGENCIES AND

00:32:14.165 --> 00:32:14.899
WITH RESPECT TO THE STATE

00:32:14.966 --> 00:32:16.968
AGENCIES ARE YOU REFERRING TO

00:32:17.035 --> 00:32:17.769
THE CONTROL THAT THE

00:32:17.835 --> 00:32:21.873
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROJECT OR

00:32:21.939 --> 00:32:23.274
THE UTILIZATION OF THE PRODUCT.

00:32:23.341 --> 00:32:25.243
SO WITH EITHER ONE HAVE WORKED

00:32:25.310 --> 00:32:25.777
WITH CAGE WITH THE

00:32:25.843 --> 00:32:26.444
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROJECT WE

00:32:26.511 --> 00:32:27.211
DID BREAK IT DOWN INTO THE

00:32:27.278 --> 00:32:29.213
MILESTONES AND LAST YEAR THE

00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:31.115
LEGISLATURE DID TILE HI THE

00:32:31.182 --> 00:32:33.551
MILESTONES. TO SUM APPROPRIATION

00:32:33.618 --> 00:32:37.188
DOLLARS FOR FOR THE SO THAT

00:32:37.255 --> 00:32:38.623
MECHANISM.

00:32:38.690 --> 00:32:42.327
IS IN PLACE WE HAVE BEEN ABLE.

00:32:42.393 --> 00:32:43.795
TO SUCCESSFULLY DELIVER ON THE

00:32:43.861 --> 00:32:46.230
BUT I BELIEVE WILL BE AT THE THE

00:32:46.297 --> 00:32:48.066
FOUR MILESTONES WE HAVE A GOOD

00:32:48.132 --> 00:32:49.534
WAY AT THE FIFTH MILESTONE.

00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:52.103
COMPLETED BUT BECAUSE OF

00:32:52.170 --> 00:32:53.905
RESOURCES CONSTRAINTS OR ISSUES

COMPLEX AS WE'RE TRYING TO

00:32:56.741 --> 00:32:57.675
REPRODUCE.

00:32:57.742 --> 00:32:59.644
INFORMATION IN THE LEGACY SYSTEM

00:32:59.711 --> 00:33:00.611
THAT IS UTILIZED REDUCE THE

00:33:00.678 --> 00:33:01.846

00:40:36.133 --> 00:40:38.169
AT AT SOME POINT --

00:40:38.235 --> 00:40:38.769
WE ARE INTERFACING TO SOME OF

00:40:38.836 --> 00:40:42.006
THE OUR SYSTEM RIGHT NOW.

00:40:42.072 --> 00:40:44.041
AND WE HAD TO CUSTOMIZE A COUPLE

00:40:44.108 --> 00:40:46.143
OF PIECES IN OUR SYSTEM --

00:40:46.210 --> 00:40:47.778
UNTIL WE HAVE.

00:40:47.845 --> 00:40:49.346
THE LONGER TERM SOLUTION --

00:40:49.413 --> 00:40:50.948
FROM WHATEVER PAYROLL SYSTEM WE

00:40:51.015 --> 00:40:51.916
ULTIMATELY SO WHEN WILL THAT

00:40:51.982 --> 00:40:53.417
HAPPEN.

00:40:53.484 --> 00:40:54.051
YOU'D HAVE TO ASK THE CONTROLLER

00:40:54.118 --> 00:40:54.885
SORRY.

00:40:54.952 --> 00:40:56.453
BUT IT AIN'T FROM YOUR

00:40:56.520 --> 00:40:58.088
PERSPECTIVE SAID IS GOING TO BE.

00:40:58.155 --> 00:40:58.556
IN --

00:40:58.622 --> 00:40:59.490
OPERABILITY IS THAT RIGHT IT'S

00:40:59.557 --> 00:41:01.292
ALL RIGHT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW WE

00:41:01.358 --> 00:41:04.061
CREE LEGACY SYSTEM WE CURRENTLY --

00:41:04.128 --> 00:41:05.896
HAVE INFORMATION THAT COMES FROM

00:41:05.963 --> 00:41:07.865
THEIR LEGACY SYSTEM CORRECT BUT

00:41:07.932 --> 00:41:09.099
BUT SOME DAY.

00:41:09.166 --> 00:41:10.634
I UNDERSTAND LEGACY SYSTEMS

00:41:10.701 --> 00:41:12.837
BASED ON KOBOL AND EVERYBODY IN

00:41:12.903 --> 00:41:14.171
THE ROOM THAT UNDERSTANDS WHAT

00:41:14.238 --> 00:41:16.540
COBLE IS RAISE THEIR HAND.

00:41:16.607 --> 00:41:21.512
ROLL OVER.

00:41:21.579 --> 00:41:22.780
FIFTY MAYBE SIXTY ANYWAY THAT

00:41:22.847 --> 00:41:23.414
THAT OPERATES ON THE COLD BALL

00:41:23.480 --> 00:41:24.248
SYSTEM RIGHT [inaudible]

00:41:24.315 --> 00:41:25.916
SO.

00:41:25.983 --> 00:41:28.319
I THINK IT DOES IN ANY EVENT AT

00:41:28.385 --> 00:41:30.588
ANY OF IT SO THAT'S THAT'S KIND

00:41:30.654 --> 00:41:30.955
OF OUT OF DATE.

00:41:31.021 --> 00:41:31.755
ROM.

00:41:31.822 --> 00:41:34.825
IN ANY SENSE OF WHEN THAT SYSTEM

00:41:34.892 --> 00:41:35.993
WILL BE INTEROPERABLE WITH YOUR

00:41:36.060 --> 00:41:37.761
SYSTEM.

00:41:37.828 --> 00:41:39.263
SO MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT

00:41:39.330 --> 00:41:39.997
THEY'RE IN --

00:41:40.064 --> 00:41:43.167
EARLY PHASES OF DEVELOPMENT --

00:41:43.234 --> 00:41:44.568
TO PLAN THAT I BELIEVE I HAVE

00:41:44.635 --> 00:41:45.769
FOLKS HERE FROM THE STATE

00:41:45.836 --> 00:41:46.971
COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE THAT WOULD

00:41:47.037 --> 00:41:48.806

TO SPEAKER --

00:41:51.141 --> 00:41:55.045

00:41:55.112 --> 00:41:55.579
RECALLING BUT IT'S CALLED

00:41:55.646 --> 00:41:56.480
SOMETHING DIFFERENT YEAH.

00:41:56.547 --> 00:41:57.548
WE'LL WE'LL LEAVE THAT FOR

00:41:57.615 --> 00:42:02.686
ANOTHER DAY --

00:42:02.753 --> 00:42:03.520
OKAY.

00:42:03.587 --> 00:42:04.655
I THINK TO CENTER NIELSEN'S

00:42:04.722 --> 00:42:06.590
POINT THAT WE WILL NEED A

00:42:06.657 --> 00:42:10.060
PERHAPS A DEEPER DIVE --

00:42:10.127 --> 00:42:13.230
ON THIS AND LASTLY AGAIN.

00:42:13.297 --> 00:42:14.765
YOU HAVE MY SYMPATHIES SO.

00:42:14.832 --> 00:42:16.634

00:42:24.975 --> 00:42:25.209
[inaudible]

00:42:25.276 --> 00:42:27.111
I BELIEVE.

00:42:27.177 --> 00:42:29.380
KIND OF INSTITUTIONALIZED.

00:42:29.446 --> 00:42:30.581
THEN IT'S THE PRODUCT TO THE

00:42:30.648 --> 00:42:32.650
GREAT TO LIKE NICK TECHNOLOGICAL

00:42:32.716 --> 00:42:34.051
ADVANCES.

00:42:34.118 --> 00:42:35.452
BUT I FEAR THAT.

00:42:35.519 --> 00:42:36.954
SOME OF THESE PROJECTS OVER THE

00:42:37.021 --> 00:42:38.822
DECADES.

00:42:38.889 --> 00:42:40.457
EITHER BY THE PROVIDER OF OR

MAYBE BY THE AGENCIES.

00:42:42.693 --> 00:42:46.463
WE HAVE HAD NEW TECHNOLOGY.

00:42:46.530 --> 00:42:48.999
KIND OF THE CHARMING MEETING.

00:42:49.066 --> 00:42:50.234
TEMPTING US.

00:42:50.301 --> 00:42:52.036

00:42:52.102 --> 00:42:53.470
SOMETHING WITH CONTRACTED FOR

00:42:53.537 --> 00:42:55.139
NOW THAT'S ALL OLD.

00:42:55.205 --> 00:42:56.807
AND NOW WE HAVE SOMETHING NEW.

00:42:56.874 --> 00:42:58.008

NOW THERE'S NEW PROCESS

00:43:23.367 --> 00:43:25.336
QUESTION IS MORE --

00:43:25.402 --> 00:43:26.870

ACTUALLY DO IT MYSELF.

00:54:12.616 --> 00:54:14.084
SO I I CAN'T SPEAK TO THE

00:54:14.150 --> 00:54:15.485
LEGISLATURE'S TRAVEL PRACTICES

00:54:15.552 --> 00:54:17.153

01:13:32.808 --> 01:13:35.310
NOT DIRECTLY BUT IT ONE THING IS

01:13:35.377 --> 01:13:37.813
FOR A COMPANY THEN TURNS AROUND.

01:13:37.880 --> 01:13:41.884
AND DOESN'T PROVIDE THAT --

01:13:41.950 --> 01:13:44.953
SO ALL THESE MEN AND WOMEN WHO I

01:13:45.020 --> 01:13:46.421
TALKED ABOUT HAVING HAD MEDICAL

01:13:46.488 --> 01:13:47.990
INSURANCE.

01:13:48.056 --> 01:13:49.591
PRIOR TO A DIFFERENT COMPANY

01:13:49.658 --> 01:13:50.425
COMING IN.

01:13:50.492 --> 01:13:52.327
A BY THE END CONTACTED BY THE

01:13:52.394 --> 01:13:55.197
AIRLINE OR HAVING OTHER --

01:13:55.264 --> 01:13:57.199
VERY IMPORTANT THINGS IN THEIR

01:13:57.266 --> 01:13:58.400
LIVES WAGES.

01:13:58.467 --> 01:14:02.004
SO HERE WE ARE HELPING OUR YOU

01:14:02.070 --> 01:14:04.706
KNOW LOOKING AT VALUE AS GREEN

01:14:04.773 --> 01:14:07.509
IN OR SAVING US MONEY BUT THEN.

01:14:07.576 --> 01:14:09.178
THOSE SAY MEN AND WOMEN MANY OF

01:14:09.244 --> 01:14:10.212
THEM ARE GOING TO END UP HAVING

01:14:10.279 --> 01:14:12.214
TO GET PUBLIC SERVICES BECAUSE

01:14:12.281 --> 01:14:13.282
THEY CAN'T AFFORD.

01:14:13.348 --> 01:14:14.616
OR THEN I GIVEN THE HEALTH

01:14:14.683 --> 01:14:16.385
INSURANCE SO THINK ABOUT HOW

01:14:16.451 --> 01:14:17.920
THAT JUST DOESN'T MAKE SENSE FOR

01:14:17.986 --> 01:14:19.922
US SO I THINK IT'S REALLY

01:14:19.988 --> 01:14:21.890
IMPORTANT THERE TAXPAYERS JUST

01:14:21.957 --> 01:14:22.991
LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE.

01:14:23.058 --> 01:14:24.927
THAT THE VALUE SHOULD BE

01:14:24.993 --> 01:14:26.695
BROADENED TO INCLUDE THE WELL

01:14:26.762 --> 01:14:28.964
BEING OF THOSE MEN AND WOMEN WHO

01:14:29.031 --> 01:14:32.067
PROVIDE THAT THE SERVICES SO --

01:14:32.134 --> 01:14:33.735
I THINK WE'RE GONNA PULL THIS

OPEN CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION --

01:14:36.872 --> 01:14:39.408
I APPRECIATE ALL THE GOOD WORK

01:14:39.474 --> 01:14:41.210
OF THE TROUBLE PROGRAM I THINK

01:14:41.276 --> 01:14:43.712
WE HAVE TO DO MUCH MORE IN THE

01:14:43.779 --> 01:14:47.616
AREA OF WHETHER IT'S A DIRECT.

01:14:47.683 --> 01:14:48.650

BUSINESS WITH OR SUBCONTRACTOR

01:14:50.752 --> 01:14:52.020
OF THAT COMPANY.

01:14:52.087 --> 01:14:53.488
SO THEY COULD GET OUT OF NOT

01:14:53.555 --> 01:14:55.791
DOING OF WHAT THEY SHOULD I

01:14:55.858 --> 01:14:59.828
THINK THAT'S WHAT WE NEED TO PAY

01:14:59.895 --> 01:15:02.631
MORE ATTENTION.

01:15:02.698 --> 01:15:05.667

IS FOR A TOW --

01:16:02.324 --> 01:16:03.692
ONE TIME AUGMENTATION OF

REVOLVING FUND --

01:16:13.201 --> 01:16:13.735
TUNES --

01:16:13.802 --> 01:16:16.071
SUPPORT THE INSTALLATION --

01:16:16.138 --> 01:16:17.005
ZERO USING ELECTRIC VEHICLE

01:16:17.072 --> 01:16:18.407
CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE

01:16:18.473 --> 01:16:19.641
THROUGHOUT THE STATE --

01:16:19.708 --> 01:16:20.976
WITH ME SAID NANCY AND WHOSE ARE

01:16:21.043 --> 01:16:21.777
DRIFTING DIRECTOR OF THE

01:16:21.843 --> 01:16:23.011
SUSTAINABILITY PROGRAM WHO CAN

01:16:38.260 --> 01:16:38.994
I'M SORRY ALEJO'S.

01:16:39.061 --> 01:16:39.828
WE JUST HAD A COUPLE COMING

01:16:39.895 --> 01:16:40.729
CONSISTENT WITH SOME F THE

01:16:40.796 --> 01:16:41.797
COMMENTS WE MADE IN PAST YEARS

01:16:41.863 --> 01:16:43.365
AS AS WAS MENTIONED THIS IS THE

01:16:43.432 --> 01:16:44.933
THIRD YEAR THAT UP SIMILAR

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.903
PROPOSALS COME FORWARD --

01:16:47.970 --> 01:16:49.104
MAINLY OR COMMENT CENTER AROUND

01:16:49.171 --> 01:16:50.772
ON THAT THIS IS A RELATIVELY

01:16:50.839 --> 01:16:52.574
AMBITIOUS --

01:16:52.641 --> 01:16:54.376
GOAL AND THIS IS JUST FIRST THIS

01:16:54.443 --> 01:16:55.410
IS FOR STATE THESE CHARGING

01:16:55.477 --> 01:16:56.578
STATIONS --

01:16:56.645 --> 01:16:58.580
AT STATE FACILITIES BOTH FOR

01:16:58.647 --> 01:17:00.649
EMPLOYEES AS WELL AS FOR STATE

01:17:00.716 --> 01:17:01.249
VEHICLES --

01:17:01.316 --> 01:17:02.784
SO THIS WITH THIS PLAN THIS FIVE

01:17:02.851 --> 01:17:04.419
YEAR PLAN WOULD BE ABOUT NINETY

01:17:04.486 --> 01:17:05.787
FOUR MILLION --

01:17:05.854 --> 01:17:08.290
AND SUPPORT ABOUT SIX THOUSAND

01:17:08.357 --> 01:17:09.391
FIVE HUNDRED CHARGING --

01:17:09.458 --> 01:17:11.460
CHARGERS BASICALLY HI TO SERVE

01:17:11.526 --> 01:17:12.894
THOSE KINDS OF VEHICLES BUT

01:17:12.961 --> 01:17:13.962
REALLY THE GOALS ARE EVEN BEYOND

01:17:14.029 --> 01:17:15.597
THAT AND SO THAT THE COST COULD

01:17:15.664 --> 01:17:16.732
BE SOMEWHAT MORE THAN NOT.

01:17:16.798 --> 01:17:18.333
AND SO WE JUST NOTED IN THE PAST

01:17:18.400 --> 01:17:19.101
THAT THE LEGISLATURE COULD

01:17:19.167 --> 01:17:20.535
CONSIDER GIVEN THAT THE

01:17:20.602 --> 01:17:22.037
MAGNITUDE OF THIS WEATHER --

01:17:22.104 --> 01:17:23.071
IT WOULD LIKE TO SPEND GENERAL

01:17:23.138 --> 01:17:23.939
FUND WHICH IS CERTAINLY AN

01:17:24.006 --> 01:17:25.107
OPTION AND IT'S IT'S CERTAINLY

01:17:25.173 --> 01:17:26.675
APPROPRIATE OR OTHER FUNDING

01:17:26.742 --> 01:17:27.843
SOURCES WHICH HAVE BEEN USED FOR

01:17:27.909 --> 01:17:29.211
THIS TYPE OF ACTIVITY IN THE

01:17:29.277 --> 01:17:30.579
PAST FOR EXAMPLE --

01:17:30.645 --> 01:17:31.446
THE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION

01:17:31.513 --> 01:17:33.115
FUND ON THERE'S ALSO ANOTHER

01:17:33.181 --> 01:17:34.116
FUND THAT'S BEEN USED FOR THIS

01:17:34.182 --> 01:17:35.117
TYPE OF ACTIVITY IN THE PAST THE

01:17:35.183 --> 01:17:35.951
ALTERNATIVE.

01:17:36.018 --> 01:17:37.819
AND RENEWABLE FUEL AND VEHICLE

01:17:37.886 --> 01:17:39.921
TECHNOLOGY PROGRAM OF FUND SO

01:17:39.988 --> 01:17:40.922
THERE ARE SOME OTHER FUNDING

01:17:40.989 --> 01:17:42.124
SOURCES DEPENDING ON THE DECIDED

01:17:42.190 --> 01:17:46.628
PRIORITIES WE JUST WANTED TO

01:17:46.695 --> 01:17:47.362
POINT OUT FOR FOLKS [inaudible]

01:17:47.429 --> 01:17:50.399
OKAY.

01:17:50.465 --> 01:17:53.735
NO COMMENT OKAY CENTERS.

01:17:53.802 --> 01:17:56.405
SANDERS MAN I IT JUST HAVE ONE

01:17:56.471 --> 01:17:57.172
QUESTION --

01:17:57.239 --> 01:17:59.274
WE DO HAVE THE THE STATE'S GOAL

01:17:59.341 --> 01:18:00.509
OF FIVE MILLION ZERO EMISSION

01:18:00.575 --> 01:18:03.211
VEHICLES ON THE ROADS BY TWENTY

01:18:03.278 --> 01:18:04.946
THIRTY SO HOW DOES OUR PROGRAM

01:18:05.013 --> 01:18:07.282
FIT INTO THAT.

01:18:07.349 --> 01:18:09.384
SO AS YOU KNOW THAT IS A VERY

01:18:09.451 --> 01:18:11.053
VERY AGGRESSIVE GOAL I THINK

01:18:11.119 --> 01:18:12.721
THAT WITH THE STATE THAT AND THE

01:18:12.788 --> 01:18:13.688
NUMBER THAT WE WILL BE

01:18:13.755 --> 01:18:15.524
INSTALLING IS A MUCH SMALLER

01:18:15.590 --> 01:18:17.392
PERCENTAGE OF THAT HOWEVER I

01:18:17.459 --> 01:18:19.061
WOULD SAY THAT IT HAS.

01:18:19.127 --> 01:18:20.829
A SIGNIFICANCE IN TERMS OF BEING

01:18:20.896 --> 01:18:22.531
ABLE TO DEMONSTRATE LEADERSHIP

01:18:22.597 --> 01:18:24.666
BY THE STATE AS WELL AS BEING AN

01:18:24.733 --> 01:18:26.101
EXAMPLE --

01:18:26.168 --> 01:18:27.536
SO WE WOULD BE ABLE THE

01:18:27.602 --> 01:18:30.906
INFLUENCE INDUSTRY FOR INSTANCE --

01:18:30.972 --> 01:18:32.741
TO IN TERMS OF TECHNOLOGY

01:18:32.808 --> 01:18:33.909
ADOPTION IN TERMS OF EMPLOYEE

01:18:33.975 --> 01:18:35.777
ADOPTION OF VEHICLES IT CETERA

01:18:35.844 --> 01:18:37.446
BUT THE ACTUAL NUMBER THAT WE

01:18:37.512 --> 01:18:38.880
WILL BE INSTALLING IS A MUCH

01:18:38.947 --> 01:18:41.383
SMALLER PERCENTAGE OF THAT FIVE

01:18:41.450 --> 01:18:43.819
MILLION.

01:18:43.885 --> 01:18:45.720
SO -- CAN WE

01:18:45.787 --> 01:18:48.356
GET SORT THAT IN FOR MORE

01:18:48.423 --> 01:18:49.891
INFORMATION AS TO MORE

01:18:49.958 --> 01:18:51.760
INFORMATION AS TO I KNOW IT'S

01:18:51.827 --> 01:18:52.794
SMALL.

01:18:52.861 --> 01:18:54.663
BUT IT WOULD BE NICE TO SEE WHAT

01:18:54.729 --> 01:18:58.600
KIND OF INFLUENCE WE CAN HAVE

01:18:58.667 --> 01:18:59.434
THE STREET --

01:18:59.501 --> 01:19:01.536
IS OUR WAY OF YOU KNOW

01:19:01.603 --> 01:19:03.371
DESCRIBING THAT MORE THAN WE'RE

01:19:03.438 --> 01:19:04.739
JUST GOING TO HAVE INFLUENCE.

01:19:04.806 --> 01:19:06.942
AT THE ACTUAL NUMBER OF CHARGERS

01:19:07.008 --> 01:19:08.877
WE EXPECT INSTALL AND WITH THE

01:19:08.944 --> 01:19:12.147
FIVE YEAR FUNDING IS.

01:19:12.214 --> 01:19:12.781
SIXTY FIVE HUNDRED BUT I'M JUST

01:19:12.848 --> 01:19:14.950
SAYING IN COMPARISON TO WHAT WE

01:19:15.016 --> 01:19:16.418
THINK WE'RE GONNA NEED IN THE

01:19:16.485 --> 01:19:18.787
STATE CODE --

01:19:18.854 --> 01:19:20.522
I THINK WE'RE GOING TO NEED THE

01:19:20.589 --> 01:19:21.890
FIVE MILLION IN TERMS OF BEING

01:19:21.957 --> 01:19:24.259
ABLE TO SUPPLY THE STATE FLEET

01:19:24.326 --> 01:19:26.895
WILL BE ABLE TO SUPPLY A 100% OF

01:19:26.962 --> 01:19:28.296
WHAT THE STATE FLEET NEEDS.

01:19:28.363 --> 01:19:30.465
IN TERMS OF EMPLOYEE ADOPTION WE

01:19:30.532 --> 01:19:32.467
ARE PROJECTING SOMEWHERE HIGHER

01:19:32.534 --> 01:19:35.103
THAN 5% OUR NUMBERS ARE BASED ON

01:19:35.170 --> 01:19:36.605
A 5% ADOPTION BUT WE'RE

01:19:36.671 --> 01:19:38.140
EXPECTING IT COULD BE EVEN

01:19:38.206 --> 01:19:41.576
HIGHER THAN THAT 5210% EVEN SO.

01:19:41.643 --> 01:19:43.211
A IN TERMS OF JUST MEETING THE

01:19:43.278 --> 01:19:45.580
STATE NEEDS IT COULD BE EVEN

01:19:45.647 --> 01:19:47.182
DOUBLE THIS NUMBER [inaudible]

01:19:47.249 --> 01:19:50.185
RIGHT.

01:19:50.252 --> 01:19:51.419
THE MORE COMMON THING.

01:19:51.486 --> 01:19:56.124

DEPARTMENT REFERENCE THIS IS

01:20:58.954 --> 01:21:00.088
REALLY A PART OF A NUMBER

01:21:00.155 --> 01:21:01.456
PROPOSAL THAT THE ADMINISTRATION

01:21:01.523 --> 01:21:02.757
IS PUTTING FORWARD THIS YEAR

01:21:02.824 --> 01:21:03.892
REGARDING DEFERRED MAINTENANCE

01:21:03.959 --> 01:21:05.393
ABOUT SIX HUNDRED MILLION.

01:21:05.460 --> 01:21:07.028
DOLLARS WORTH OF THOSE PROPOSALS

01:21:07.095 --> 01:21:07.529
ACROSS MORE THAN TWENTY

01:21:07.596 --> 01:21:08.697
DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS ARE

01:21:08.763 --> 01:21:10.465
COMMENTS AS AN OFFICE ARE ARE

01:21:10.532 --> 01:21:11.666
PRETTY CONSISTENT ACROSS THOSE

01:21:11.733 --> 01:21:13.235
SO IT'S IN THE THINGS I'M.

01:21:13.301 --> 01:21:13.735
GONNA MENTION --

01:21:13.802 --> 01:21:14.769
REGARDING THE DEPARTMENT OF

01:21:14.836 --> 01:21:16.538
JOURNAL GENERAL SERVICES ALSO --

01:21:16.605 --> 01:21:17.939
APPLY TO THE MILITARY DEPARTMENT

01:21:18.006 --> 01:21:19.140
VETERANS DEPARTMENT WHICH I HEAR

01:21:19.207 --> 01:21:21.109
ABOUT LATER ON TODAY AS WELL AS

01:21:21.176 --> 01:21:22.510
SOME OF THE OTHER DEPARTMENTS

01:21:22.577 --> 01:21:22.944
THAT ARE HURT BY THE

01:21:23.011 --> 01:21:24.079
SUBCOMMITTEE --

01:21:24.145 --> 01:21:26.081
SO JUST A COUPLE THINGS I WANTED

01:21:26.147 --> 01:21:27.015
TO POINT OUT --

01:21:27.082 --> 01:21:28.383
AS WAS REFERENCE THIS IS WE'VE

01:21:28.450 --> 01:21:30.018
PROVIDED SOME SIGNIFICANT

01:21:30.085 --> 01:21:31.786
FUNDING IN THIS AREA IN THE PAST --

01:21:31.853 --> 01:21:34.322
AS A STATE --

01:21:34.389 --> 01:21:37.192
ACTUALLY ABOUT I THINK ONE POINT.

01:21:37.259 --> 01:21:38.493
THREE REALLY SIGNIFICANT --

01:21:38.560 --> 01:21:40.729
INVESTMENTS IN TRYING TO TACKLE

01:21:40.795 --> 01:21:42.297
ARE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE BACKLOG --

01:21:42.364 --> 01:21:44.099
BUT THEY'RE STILL QUITE A BIT OF

01:21:44.165 --> 01:21:45.267
IDENTIFIED NEED ACROSS MANY

01:21:45.333 --> 01:21:46.468
DEPARTMENTS.

01:21:46.534 --> 01:21:48.336
WE HAVE REALLY TWO MAIN --

01:21:48.403 --> 01:21:50.405
AREAS OF RECOMMENDATIONS RELATED

01:21:50.472 --> 01:21:52.007
TO THESE PROPOSALS --

01:21:52.073 --> 01:21:55.176
AND THE FIRST IS REALLY THAT --

01:21:55.243 --> 01:21:56.678
THAT.

01:21:56.745 --> 01:21:57.779
ESTHER I'LL BE ADOPTED BY THE

01:21:57.846 --> 01:21:59.347
LEGISLATURE THAT WOULD REQUIRE

01:21:59.414 --> 01:22:00.815
THE DEPARTMENT FINANCE REPORT ON

01:22:00.882 --> 01:22:02.117
THE PROJECTS THAT ARE UNDERTAKEN

01:22:02.183 --> 01:22:03.518
AND THE REASON FOR THAT OUR

01:22:03.585 --> 01:22:04.953
RECOMMENDATION IS THAT.

01:22:05.020 --> 01:22:06.221
THIS YEAR'S APPROACH DIFFERS

01:22:06.288 --> 01:22:07.722
FROM PAST YEARS APPROACHES WITH

01:22:07.789 --> 01:22:09.291
THE CONTROL SECTION SO THIS YEAR

01:22:09.357 --> 01:22:11.059
BASICALLY DEPARTMENTS ARE GONNA

01:22:11.126 --> 01:22:12.394
BE PROVIDED WITH --

01:22:12.460 --> 01:22:14.095
KIND OF A LUMP SUM AMOUNT AND

01:22:14.162 --> 01:22:15.797
DEPARTMENTS WILL IDENTIFY THE

01:22:15.864 --> 01:22:16.698
PROJECT THAT THEY'RE GONNA AND

01:22:16.765 --> 01:22:17.766
UNDERTAKE SOME PROJECT SOME

01:22:17.832 --> 01:22:18.500
DEPARTMENTS HAVE ALREADY

01:22:18.566 --> 01:22:19.934
IDENTIFIED THOSE PROJECTS FOR

01:22:20.001 --> 01:22:21.503
EXAMPLE TGS HAS IDENTIFIED SOME

01:22:21.569 --> 01:22:23.138
PROJECT THAT THEY'RE EXPECTING

01:22:23.204 --> 01:22:25.240
TO UNDERTAKE.

01:22:25.307 --> 01:22:26.975
IDENTIFIED THOSE PROJECTS --

01:22:27.042 --> 01:22:28.343
BUT EVEN IF THE DEPARTMENT HAVE

01:22:28.410 --> 01:22:30.211
IDENTIFIED AS PROJECTS THE WAY

01:22:30.278 --> 01:22:30.979
THAT THAT --

01:22:31.046 --> 01:22:32.647
MECHANISM IS SET UP THEY COULD

01:22:32.714 --> 01:22:33.815
MAKE CHANGES TO THOSE PROJECTS

01:22:33.882 --> 01:22:35.784
SUBSEQUENTLY AND SO REALLY THIS

01:22:35.850 --> 01:22:37.118
REPORTING LANGUAGE WOULD JUST

01:22:37.185 --> 01:22:38.320
ENSURE THAT THE LEGISLATURE

01:22:38.386 --> 01:22:42.190
WOULD HAVE INFORMATION --

01:22:42.257 --> 01:22:42.824
ON WHAT PROJECTS ARE ULTIMATELY

01:22:42.891 --> 01:22:46.127
UNDER TO RIGHT WHICH PROJECTS

01:22:46.194 --> 01:22:47.128
WERE UNDERTAKEN IN KIND OF TRACK

01:22:47.195 --> 01:22:48.530
THAT I'M IN THAT WOULDN'T BE TOO

01:22:48.596 --> 01:22:49.831
DIFFERENT FROM WHAT DEPARTMENTS

01:22:49.898 --> 01:22:50.899
ARE CURRENTLY DOING WITH THE

01:22:50.965 --> 01:22:51.466
DEFERRED MAINTENANCE FUNDING

01:22:51.533 --> 01:22:52.634
THAT THEY RECEIVED IN PAST YEARS

01:22:52.701 --> 01:22:53.001
THEY'VE.

01:22:53.068 --> 01:22:54.202
THEY'VE TRACKED WHAT PROJECT

01:22:54.269 --> 01:22:57.172
THEY ULTIMATELY HAVE UNDERTAKEN.

01:22:57.238 --> 01:22:59.307
REALLY THE SECOND ON MAJOR AREA

01:22:59.374 --> 01:23:01.109
OF RECOMMENDATION FOR ASK IS

01:23:01.176 --> 01:23:03.078
RELATED TO TRY TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:23:03.144 --> 01:23:05.647
WE'RE MAINTAINING OUR BUILDINGS

01:23:05.714 --> 01:23:07.248
ON AN ONGOING BASIS BETTER.

01:23:07.315 --> 01:23:08.550
SO I THEY MENTION WE'VE WE'VE

01:23:08.616 --> 01:23:09.984
INVESTED QUITE A BIT OF STATE

01:23:10.051 --> 01:23:10.952
FUNDING AND IN DIFFERENT

01:23:11.019 --> 01:23:11.986
MAINTENANCE --

01:23:12.053 --> 01:23:13.521
OVER THE YEARS AND WE STILL IN

01:23:13.588 --> 01:23:14.556
MANY CASES HAVE A VERY

01:23:14.622 --> 01:23:16.391
SIGNIFICANT BACKLOG --

01:23:16.458 --> 01:23:17.392
AND THAT'S TRUE FOR EXAMPLE FOR

01:23:17.459 --> 01:23:20.528
TGS -- SO IN

01:23:20.595 --> 01:23:21.096
TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN SIXTEEN

01:23:21.162 --> 01:23:21.730
WHEN WE STARTED PROVIDING THEM

01:23:21.796 --> 01:23:22.797
WITH FUNDS THE BACKLOG WAS

01:23:22.864 --> 01:23:24.265
IDENTIFIED AT A HUNDRED AND

01:23:24.332 --> 01:23:24.999
THIRTY EIGHT MILLION.

01:23:25.066 --> 01:23:26.935
AND NOW IT'S TWO HUNDRED TWENTY

01:23:27.001 --> 01:23:28.136
ONE MILLION AND WE HAVE --

01:23:28.203 --> 01:23:29.571
WE'VE GIVEN THEM TWENTY SEVEN

01:23:29.637 --> 01:23:31.539
MILLION IN THAT TIME FRAME SO

01:23:31.606 --> 01:23:32.974
THERE BACK LIKE IT'S CONTINUED

01:23:33.041 --> 01:23:34.743
TO GROW EVEN WITH THESE

01:23:34.809 --> 01:23:36.444
ADDITIONAL INFUSIONS OF FINES --

01:23:36.511 --> 01:23:38.713
THAT POINTS TO POTENTIALLY --

01:23:38.780 --> 01:23:40.548
MAYBE SOME CHALLENGES WITH THEIR

01:23:40.615 --> 01:23:41.583
ON GOING MAINTENANCE PROGRAM

01:23:41.649 --> 01:23:42.684
THAT MAYBE WE'RE NOT FINDING IT

01:23:42.751 --> 01:23:44.085
SUFFICIENTLY OR MAYBE TERE ARE

01:23:44.152 --> 01:23:45.620
OTHER ISSUES GOING ON THERE --

01:23:45.687 --> 01:23:46.788
OR MAYBE WE'RE JUST NOT TRACKING

01:23:46.855 --> 01:23:48.056
IT WELL THEY'RE THEY'RE PROBABLY

01:23:48.123 --> 01:23:51.826
A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT POSSIBLE --

01:23:51.893 --> 01:23:52.427
POSSIBLE REASONS FOR THAT AND

01:23:52.494 --> 01:23:56.431
AND TO KIND OF KEEP UP WITH

01:23:56.498 --> 01:23:57.732
THEIR ON GOING MAINTENANCE.

01:23:57.799 --> 01:23:58.299
AND SO WE HAVE A COUPLE OF

01:23:58.366 --> 01:23:59.834
RECOMMENDATIONS RELATED TO THAT

01:23:59.901 --> 01:24:01.002
BECAUSE WE REALLY THINK THAT WE

01:24:01.069 --> 01:24:02.070
SHOULDN'T BE HAVING TO PROVIDE

01:24:02.137 --> 01:24:03.505
DEFERRED MAINTENANCE FUNDING

01:24:03.571 --> 01:24:04.873
EVERY YEAR RIGHT THAT WE SHOULD.

01:24:04.939 --> 01:24:07.008
PROVIDE FUNDING TO ADDRESS THE

01:24:07.075 --> 01:24:08.810
BACKLOG AND THEN WE SHOULD TRY

01:24:08.877 --> 01:24:09.744
TO ENCOURAGE DEPARTMENT TO HAVE

01:24:09.811 --> 01:24:11.146
BETTER MAINTENANCE POLICIES ON

01:24:11.212 --> 01:24:13.214
AN ONGOING BASIS SO WE DON'T

01:24:13.281 --> 01:24:14.416
CONTINUE TO DEVELOP THIS BACKLOG.

01:24:14.482 --> 01:24:17.218
ON SO PART OF THAT WE THINK IS

01:24:17.285 --> 01:24:18.853
HAVING DEPARTMENTS SUCH AS THIS --

01:24:18.920 --> 01:24:19.854
ONE REPORTED BUDGET HEARINGS

01:24:19.921 --> 01:24:21.523
LIKE THIS ON ON WHAT THEY'RE

01:24:21.589 --> 01:24:22.157
DOING TO TRY TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:24:22.223 --> 01:24:24.159
THIR BUILDINGS ARE MAINTAIN

01:24:24.225 --> 01:24:26.127
SUFFICIENTLY ON AN ONGOING BASIS --

01:24:26.194 --> 01:24:27.629
AND ANOTHER KEY COMPONENT IS

01:24:27.695 --> 01:24:29.130
AGAIN SOME SOME SUPPLEMENT

01:24:29.197 --> 01:24:30.131
REPORTING LANGUAGE THAT WE THINK

01:24:30.198 --> 01:24:32.534
WOULD BE REALLY IMPORTANT WHICH

01:24:32.600 --> 01:24:34.502
WOULD HAVE THE DEPARTMENT REPORT.

01:24:34.569 --> 01:24:35.804
IN TWENTY TWENTY THREE ONLINE

01:24:35.870 --> 01:24:37.272
WHAT ITS BACKLOG AS AND IT TO

01:24:37.338 --> 01:24:39.574
THE EXTENT THAT IT'S GROWN IN

01:24:39.641 --> 01:24:40.208
THE INTERIM AT THAT POINT THEY

01:24:40.275 --> 01:24:40.809
SHOULD HAVE.

01:24:40.875 --> 01:24:42.544
MOM LIKELY SPENT THESE FUNDS AND

01:24:42.610 --> 01:24:43.711
TO THE EXTENT THAT THEY'RE BACK

01:24:43.778 --> 01:24:45.180
LIKE HAS CONTINUED TO GROW WE

01:24:45.246 --> 01:24:48.082
REQUIRE REPORT FROM THEM ON WHAT

01:24:48.149 --> 01:24:49.584
THEIR PLAN IS NOW ON WHY IT'S

01:24:49.651 --> 01:24:51.119
GROWN AND WHAT THEIR PLAN IS TO

01:24:51.186 --> 01:24:52.620
ADDRESS IT --

01:24:52.687 --> 01:24:53.354
BECAUSE WE REALLY DO YOU THINK

01:24:53.421 --> 01:24:54.389
THAT -- BUT

01:24:54.456 --> 01:24:55.557
IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE GET A

01:24:55.623 --> 01:24:57.926
BETTER HANDLE ON HOW DO WE HAVE

01:24:57.992 --> 01:24:58.760
BETTER ON GOING MAINTENANCE

01:24:58.827 --> 01:25:00.028
PRACTICES --

01:25:00.094 --> 01:25:02.263
ON AN ONGOING BASIS SO THAT'S

01:25:02.330 --> 01:25:06.868
THAT THAT'S THE SUMMARY PLEASE

01:25:06.935 --> 01:25:07.435
LET ME KNOW IF YOU HAVE ANY

01:25:07.502 --> 01:25:09.170
QUESTIONS [inaudible]

01:25:09.237 --> 01:25:11.739
QUICK FINAL.

01:25:11.806 --> 01:25:12.540
JUMP BETTER DEPARTMENT OF

01:25:12.607 --> 01:25:13.541
FINANCE -- I

01:25:13.608 --> 01:25:14.042
WOULD JUST NOTE THAT --

01:25:14.108 --> 01:25:14.876
THE REPORTING STRUCTURE UNDER

01:25:14.943 --> 01:25:18.379
THE EXPLAIN WHY NO DIFFERS FROM

01:25:18.446 --> 01:25:19.614
THIS PARTICULAR APPROACH THIS

01:25:19.681 --> 01:25:20.715
YEARAND I THINK THE

01:25:20.782 --> 01:25:21.916
ADMINISTRATION IS --

01:25:21.983 --> 01:25:24.219
OPEN TO FURTHER DISCUSSION ABOUT

01:25:24.285 --> 01:25:25.386
HOW -- TO

01:25:25.453 --> 01:25:27.489
BAKER AN EFFECTIVE IN TARGETED

01:25:27.555 --> 01:25:29.257
REPORTING STRUCTURE FOR THIS

01:25:29.324 --> 01:25:31.626
PARTICULAR STATEWIDE.

01:25:31.693 --> 01:25:34.229
BATCH OF PROPOSALS.

01:25:34.295 --> 01:25:35.563
OKAY.

01:25:35.630 --> 01:25:37.198
SO I WHICH WE'RE TRYING ARE YOU

01:25:37.265 --> 01:25:38.366
TRYING TO GET.

01:25:38.433 --> 01:25:40.668
A ARE YOU TRYING TO GET TO A OF

01:25:40.735 --> 01:25:43.571
MASTER LIST OF ALL THE DEFERRED.

01:25:43.638 --> 01:25:44.739
MAINTENANCE.

01:25:44.806 --> 01:25:46.341
BY DEPARTMENT AND THEN IN TOTAL

01:25:46.407 --> 01:25:48.743
FOR THE STATE.

01:25:48.810 --> 01:25:50.345
SO --

01:25:50.411 --> 01:25:51.012
TYPICALLY THE PART THAT WITH AT

01:25:51.079 --> 01:25:53.448
LEAST THE YEAH BUT IDEA OF HOW

01:25:53.515 --> 01:25:54.716
WE'RE GOING TO GET.

01:25:54.782 --> 01:25:55.950
EXACTLY ALL OF THEM SO IT

01:25:56.017 --> 01:25:57.886
ACTUALLY OVER IT IN RECENT YEARS --

01:25:57.952 --> 01:25:59.454
DEPARTMENTS HAVE PUT TOGETHER A

01:25:59.521 --> 01:26:01.122
LIST OF SPECIFIC PROJECTS THAT

01:26:01.189 --> 01:26:02.023
MAKE UP THEIR DEFERRED

01:26:02.090 --> 01:26:03.391
MAINTENANCE BACKLOG SOMETIMES

01:26:03.458 --> 01:26:04.993
IT'S TAKEN A SEVERAL MONTHS

01:26:05.059 --> 01:26:05.727
AFTER THE BUDGETS BEEN

01:26:05.793 --> 01:26:06.694
INTRODUCED --

01:26:06.761 --> 01:26:08.363
TO TO HAVE THOSE WITH SOLIDIFIED

01:26:08.429 --> 01:26:09.797
BUT THOSE LISTS EXIST --

01:26:09.864 --> 01:26:10.932
AND SOMETIMES THEY'VE CHANGED

01:26:10.999 --> 01:26:12.267
SIGNIFICANTLY OVER TIME SO WE'VE

01:26:12.333 --> 01:26:13.401
BEEN GETTING THOSE LESSONS I

01:26:13.468 --> 01:26:15.436
THINK TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN

01:26:15.503 --> 01:26:16.070
SIXTEEN AND IF YOU LOOK ACROSS

01:26:16.137 --> 01:26:17.205
DEPARTMENT SOMETIMES THEY'VE

01:26:17.272 --> 01:26:18.673
GONE UP AND DOWN IN PROJECT THE

01:26:18.740 --> 01:26:19.974
PHONE UP AND YOU'D EXPECT SOME

01:26:20.041 --> 01:26:23.344
OF THAT BECAUSE YOUR BUILDING'S

01:26:23.411 --> 01:26:25.813
AGING NEW THINGS COME UP.

01:26:25.880 --> 01:26:27.882
IT IS THAT THE LEVEL OF CHANGES

01:26:27.949 --> 01:26:29.551
OVER FROM YEAR TO YEAR HAVE BEEN --

01:26:29.617 --> 01:26:30.985
HARD TO EXPLAIN I THINK OUR

01:26:31.052 --> 01:26:33.588
RECOMMENDATION SO WE HAVE THAT --

01:26:33.655 --> 01:26:34.822
IN MANY CASES THIS YEAR ALTHOUGH

01:26:34.889 --> 01:26:36.624
NOT IN ALL CASES.

01:26:36.691 --> 01:26:38.159
I THINK OUR WHAT WE WANT TO KNOW --

01:26:38.226 --> 01:26:39.327
WHAT WE'RE RECOMMENDING IS

01:26:39.394 --> 01:26:40.929
INFORMATION ON WHAT PROJECTS ARE

01:26:40.995 --> 01:26:42.897
ULTIMATELY UNDERTAKEN WITH THESE

01:26:42.964 --> 01:26:44.332
FUNDS BECAUSE?

01:26:44.399 --> 01:26:46.234
OF BAG THE CURRENT APPROACH

01:26:46.301 --> 01:26:48.069
WOULD NOT GUARANTEE THAT THE

01:26:48.136 --> 01:26:49.771
LEGISLATURE WOULD HAVE ANY WAY

01:26:49.837 --> 01:26:50.905
OF KNOWING WHICH SPECIFIC

01:26:50.972 --> 01:26:52.607
PROJECTS ARE ULTIMATELY FUNDED

01:26:52.674 --> 01:26:53.942
WITH THESE FUNDS AND IN SOME

01:26:54.008 --> 01:26:55.443
CASES --

01:26:55.510 --> 01:26:56.744
PLACE WITH PAST FINDING SOME OF

01:26:56.811 --> 01:26:57.712
THE PROPOSED PROJECT NOT

01:26:57.779 --> 01:26:58.980
NECESSARILY FOR FOR DJ

01:26:59.047 --> 01:27:00.648
SPECIFICALLY BUT IN SOME CASES

01:27:00.715 --> 01:27:02.383
THEY'VE BEEN VERY LARGE PROJECTS --

01:27:02.450 --> 01:27:04.185
MANY YOU KNOW MILLIONS OF

01:27:04.252 --> 01:27:05.119
DOLLARS --

01:27:05.186 --> 01:27:06.154
INDIVIDUALLY SO SOME OF THEM

01:27:06.220 --> 01:27:07.722
HAVE BEEN VERY LARGE I'M IN SOME

01:27:07.789 --> 01:27:08.623
CASES DEPARTMENTS HAVE

01:27:08.690 --> 01:27:09.757
CONSIDERED PROJECTS THAT

01:27:09.824 --> 01:27:10.792
WOULDN'T NECESSARILY BE THINGS

01:27:10.858 --> 01:27:11.926
THAT WE WOULD CONSIDER DEFERRED

01:27:11.993 --> 01:27:13.428
MAINTENANCE AND SO WE THINK IT'S

01:27:13.494 --> 01:27:14.529
JUST IMPORTANT TO HAVE SOME

01:27:14.596 --> 01:27:15.997
LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT OVER

01:27:16.064 --> 01:27:17.632
WHAT'S GOING TO GO --

01:27:17.699 --> 01:27:19.033
ME WHAT'S ALTERNATELY FIND IT

01:27:19.100 --> 01:27:20.368
AND THAT THAT THAT ADDITIONAL

01:27:20.435 --> 01:27:22.003
TRANSPARENCY WILL BE HELPFUL AND

01:27:22.070 --> 01:27:23.972
I'LL HELP IT'S JUST TRACK BETTER --

01:27:24.038 --> 01:27:25.106
KIND OF WHAT'S GOING ON WITH

01:27:25.173 --> 01:27:30.478
THOSEBACKLOGS --

01:27:30.545 --> 01:27:31.112
MEET AT NEAR FROM YEAR TO YEAR

01:27:31.179 --> 01:27:35.717
THE PRACTICES IN BASIS.

01:27:35.783 --> 01:27:37.352
OKAY -- JUST

01:27:37.418 --> 01:27:39.220
TO JUST ONE QUESTION --

01:27:39.287 --> 01:27:41.923
BABY USING YOUR DEPARTMENT --

01:27:41.990 --> 01:27:42.490
THAT WOULD HELP US FOR ALL

01:27:42.557 --> 01:27:44.092
DEPARTMENTS IS HOW WOULD YOU

01:27:44.158 --> 01:27:46.527
PRIORITIZE A PROJECTS.

01:27:46.594 --> 01:27:48.496
OR HOW HAE YOU PRIORITIZE THE

01:27:48.563 --> 01:27:50.098
PROJECTS.

01:27:50.164 --> 01:27:50.865
SO WE'VE WE'VE GONE THROUGH --

01:27:50.932 --> 01:27:52.300
A GREAT DEAL OF CONSIDERATION

01:27:52.367 --> 01:27:53.368
INTERNALLY AND THEN ALSO LIVED

01:27:53.434 --> 01:27:55.136
IN OF THE PARTNERS --

01:27:55.203 --> 01:27:56.204
WITHIN OUR DEPARTMENT EVEN IN

01:27:56.270 --> 01:27:57.605
SOME INSTANCES HAVE WORKED

01:27:57.672 --> 01:27:58.573
OUTSIDE OF AGING --

01:27:58.640 --> 01:27:59.474
OUR DEPARTMENT WITH OTHER

01:27:59.540 --> 01:28:01.209
AGENCIES AND DEPARTMENTS TO MAKE

01:28:01.275 --> 01:28:02.276
SURE THEY WERE ON THE SAME PAGE

01:28:02.343 --> 01:28:03.745
AND IF YOU IF YOU BEGIN TO LOOK

01:28:03.811 --> 01:28:05.446
AT THE CATEGORY OF PROJECTS

01:28:05.513 --> 01:28:07.315
THEY'RE ALL --

01:28:07.382 --> 01:28:08.516
THEY'LL KIND OF FILE ON THE FIVE

01:28:08.583 --> 01:28:09.450
GENERAL CATEGORIES --

01:28:09.517 --> 01:28:11.352
WE'VE LISTED AT LEAST THREE IN

01:28:11.419 --> 01:28:12.654
OUR ANALYSIS AND AND REALLY

01:28:12.720 --> 01:28:13.821
YOU'RE LOOKING AT FAR LIFE AND

01:28:13.888 --> 01:28:15.256
SAFETY ISSUES THE MOST IMMEDIATE

01:28:15.323 --> 01:28:15.857
ONCE YOU HAVE TO DRESS RIGHT

01:28:15.923 --> 01:28:16.758
AWAY.

01:28:16.824 --> 01:28:19.961
THE ONE AND AFTER THAT YOU HAVE

01:28:20.028 --> 01:28:22.063
CRITICAL ONES WHICH COULD LEAD

01:28:22.130 --> 01:28:23.398
FIRED BY.

01:28:23.464 --> 01:28:24.899

PRIORITIES AFTER THAT I MEAN.

01:28:30.705 --> 01:28:32.040
IT REALLY KIND OF DEPENDS ON THE

01:28:32.106 --> 01:28:33.675
EMERGENCIES THAT WERE RESPONDING

01:28:33.741 --> 01:28:35.109

IN ALMOST EMERGENCY IT IS FOR

01:28:40.815 --> 01:28:42.417
THE AGE OF OUR BUILDINGS AND FOR

01:28:42.483 --> 01:28:43.584
THE KINDS OF PROJECTS THAT WE'RE

01:28:43.651 --> 01:28:44.619

THESE ARE THE MOST CRITICAL

01:28:49.057 --> 01:28:50.725
SYSTEMS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

01:28:50.792 --> 01:28:51.459
NOW WE NEED TO REPLACE

THIS IS A SIXTY FIVE YEAR OLD

01:30:31.392 --> 01:30:33.928
COMPLEX THAT IS GROSSLY OVER

01:30:33.995 --> 01:30:37.165
SIZED AT ABOUT. FOUR HUNDRED

IT DOESN'T HAVE CENTRAL HEATING

01:30:55.783 --> 01:30:57.285
THERE CAN'T BE REPURPOSE FOR

01:30:57.351 --> 01:30:58.319
OTHER USES --

01:30:58.386 --> 01:31:01.355
AND THE BUILDING AND THE SITE

01:31:01.422 --> 01:31:04.959
ITSELF IS.

UNDERGROUND STORAGE TANKS --

01:31:13.334 --> 01:31:14.335
THAT NEED TO BE REMEDIATED --

01:31:14.402 --> 01:31:16.170
WHEN THE PRINT THAT WAS ACTUALLY

01:31:16.237 --> 01:31:18.105
ORIGINALLY CREATED WAS BACK WITH

01:31:18.172 --> 01:31:19.140
THE STATE PRINTER ACTUALLY

PROPERTY ITSELF IN THE THE

01:31:28.316 --> 01:31:29.250
REMEDIATED IT'S AN ANTIQUE

01:31:29.317 --> 01:31:29.951
ANTIQUATED --

01:31:30.017 --> 01:31:30.918
FACILITY ITSELF --

01:31:30.985 --> 01:31:31.819
WE WE WOULD WE NEED TO TAKE

01:31:31.886 --> 01:31:33.454
ABOUT TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND TONS

01:31:33.521 --> 01:31:35.022
OF DIRT AND REMEDIATED TO

DISPOSE OF IT --

01:31:35.756 --> 01:31:42.063
IT IS A CONTAMINATED SITE --

01:31:42.129 --> 01:31:42.597
SO THIS PROJECT WILL BE

01:31:42.663 --> 01:31:43.564
REQUESTING TWENTY ONE POINT FOUR

01:31:43.631 --> 01:31:44.565

TWO THOUSAND EIGHT AND THAT

01:31:58.546 --> 01:31:59.847
UPDATED IN TWENTY FIFTEEN AT

01:31:59.914 --> 01:32:01.048
LEGISLATIVE REQUEST.

SPACE --

01:32:05.987 --> 01:32:07.722
THAT LONG RANGE PLANNING STUDY

01:32:07.788 --> 01:32:10.024
IT IDENTIFY --

01:32:10.091 --> 01:32:11.058
FOR SPACE ACT THERE WAS NOT

01:32:11.125 --> 01:32:13.027
ENOUGH SPACE IN SACRAMENTO FOR

01:32:13.094 --> 01:32:13.628
THE PROJECTED GROWTH OF STATE

01:32:13.694 --> 01:32:14.862
EMPLOYEES --

AND WE'RE FINDING THAT OUT --

01:32:16.797 --> 01:32:18.366
JUST IN PRACTICE EVERY DAY --

01:32:18.432 --> 01:32:20.268
WE ARE SEEING THAT SACRAMENTO IS

01:32:20.334 --> 01:32:22.770
IMPACTED LEASING PERSPECTIVE J.

01:32:22.837 --> 01:32:24.538
L. L. WHICH IS A A NATIONAL REAL

01:32:24.605 --> 01:32:26.140
ESTATE FIRM IS ADVISING CLIENTS

01:32:26.207 --> 01:32:27.475
THAT THEY EXPECT RATESIN

01:32:27.541 --> 01:32:29.477
SACRAMENTO TO GO BETWEEN 78%

01:32:29.543 --> 01:32:31.779
ANNUALLY FOR THE NEXT FEW YEARS --

01:32:31.846 --> 01:32:33.781
IN FACT WE ARE ALSO EXPERIENCING

01:32:33.848 --> 01:32:35.850
LESSORS ATTEMPTING TO HIKE RATES

01:32:35.917 --> 01:32:36.684
UP -- ONE

01:32:36.751 --> 01:32:39.320
VERY LARGE LEASE IN SACRAMENTO --

01:32:39.387 --> 01:32:40.655
AND DURING REGIONAL GLACIATIONS

01:32:40.721 --> 01:32:42.356
A LESSOR --

01:32:42.423 --> 01:32:44.492
WAS VERY INSISTENT ON A 30%

01:32:44.558 --> 01:32:45.459
INCREASE OBVIOUSLY WE DIDN'T

01:32:45.526 --> 01:32:47.428
GIVE THEM A 30% INCREASE --

01:32:47.495 --> 01:32:48.596
BUT IT'S REFLECTIVE OF WHAT

01:32:48.663 --> 01:32:50.031
WE'RE SEEING IN THE MARKET.

01:32:50.097 --> 01:32:51.632
IN SO -- IN

01:32:51.699 --> 01:32:53.734
LIGHT OF THE LONG TERM PLANNING

WE ARE ULTIMATELY LOOKING TO

01:33:10.818 --> 01:33:11.786
LEVERAGE THESE BUILDINGS TO

01:33:11.852 --> 01:33:13.087
ADDRESS OUR MOST EFFICIENT

01:33:13.154 --> 01:33:14.221
INFRASTRUCTURE AS WAS JUST

01:33:14.288 --> 01:33:15.790
TESTIFIED THERE IS A DEFERRED

01:33:15.856 --> 01:33:16.724

CATALOGS --

01:33:23.597 --> 01:33:24.165
WENT THROUGH DID ASSESSMENTS AND

01:33:24.231 --> 01:33:26.767
EVALUATIONS ARE XIN SEES AND

01:33:26.834 --> 01:33:28.202
THEN RANK THEM IN TERMS OF

01:33:28.269 --> 01:33:30.371
SEVERUS AND MOST EFFICIENT

01:33:30.438 --> 01:33:31.839
BUILDINGS --

01:33:31.906 --> 01:33:32.573
UP WE CAME OVER THE SEQUENCING

01:33:32.640 --> 01:33:34.108
PLAN AS WE BUILD THESE NEW

THEM INTO THE NEW BUILDING'S.

01:33:39.113 --> 01:33:40.214
RENOVATE THE SPACE BEHIND THEM

01:33:40.281 --> 01:33:41.182
AND THEY TAKE TENANTS FROM THE

01:33:41.248 --> 01:33:42.616
NEXT MOST EFFICIENT SPACE AND

RENOVATIONS TO ADDRESS OUR

01:33:44.719 --> 01:33:45.686
DEFICIENCIES --

01:33:45.753 --> 01:33:48.155
THIS IS THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE

01:33:48.222 --> 01:33:48.990
AND INNOVATIVE WAY OF OF DOING

01:33:49.056 --> 01:33:49.390
THAT --

01:33:49.457 --> 01:33:50.992
THESE BUILDINGS ARE ALSO --

THEY ARE PART OF A NEW BREED OF

01:33:55.262 --> 01:33:56.597
STATE CONSTRUCTION THAT WE ARE

CONSOLIDATIONS WERE SING BETWEEN

01:34:04.905 --> 01:34:06.507
FIFTEEN AND 30% REDUCTION IN

01:34:06.574 --> 01:34:08.275
STATE BUT PRINT BY DOING THESE

01:34:08.342 --> 01:34:09.276
PROJECTS --

01:34:09.343 --> 01:34:12.179
WE ARE LOOKING AT WORKING

THEY'RE ALSO DESIGNED THESE

01:34:25.760 --> 01:34:26.961
PROJECTS FOR FUTURE FLEXIBILITY

01:34:27.028 --> 01:34:28.662
AND APARTMENT OF GROWTH AND WE

01:34:28.729 --> 01:34:30.097
ALSO HAVE --

01:34:30.164 --> 01:34:32.099
A PRETTY ROBUST IN A VERY UNIQUE

MENTIONED --

01:34:43.577 --> 01:34:44.779
THAT STUDY THAT IN FIVE OR MOST

01:34:44.845 --> 01:34:46.380
EFFICIENT BUILDINGS WELL THIS IS

01:34:46.447 --> 01:34:48.015
NUMBER ONE ON THE LIST --

01:34:48.082 --> 01:34:48.749
IT IS THE MOST EFFICIENT

01:34:48.816 --> 01:34:50.051
BUILDING THE STATE OWNS --

01:34:50.117 --> 01:34:51.285
WE ARE ASKING FOR A POINT EIGHT

01:34:51.352 --> 01:34:52.820
MILLION DOLLARS IN PERFORMANCE

01:34:52.887 --> 01:34:53.654
CRITERIA TO RENOVATE THE

BUILDING.

01:34:54.588 --> 01:34:56.490
THIS BUILDING WAS BUILT IN

01:34:56.557 --> 01:34:57.024
NINETEEN SIXTY FOUR IT WAS

01:34:57.091 --> 01:34:57.691
ORIGINALLY CALLED THE RETIREMENT

01:34:57.758 --> 01:34:58.626

YEAH POST WAR ENVIRONMENT --

01:35:05.633 --> 01:35:08.335
IT IS ALSO A HISTORIC BUILDING --

01:35:08.402 --> 01:35:11.739
THE BUILDING IS IN NEED OF A ALL

01:35:11.806 --> 01:35:12.807
BUILDING SYSTEMS MECHANICAL

PLUMBING ELECTRICAL

01:35:13.774 --> 01:35:15.109
TELECOMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS NEED

01:35:15.176 --> 01:35:16.410
TO BE REPLACED --

01:35:16.477 --> 01:35:17.478
THERE ARE NUMEROUS FIRE LIFE

01:35:17.545 --> 01:35:18.679
SAFETY ISSUES FOR THE BUILDING

01:35:18.746 --> 01:35:19.680
INCLUDING.

SPRINKLERS --

01:35:22.383 --> 01:35:24.085
WE WILL NEED TO RENOVATE THE

01:35:24.151 --> 01:35:25.853
THREE STORY A THREE SEVENTEEN

01:35:25.920 --> 01:35:27.288
STORY STAIRS IN THE BUILDING FOR

01:35:27.354 --> 01:35:29.290
EXITING FOR BUSES TO MEET CODE

01:35:29.356 --> 01:35:30.424
AND CORRECT SEISMIC DEFICIENCIES.

01:35:30.491 --> 01:35:32.927
IT'S COME A BAD THING TO HAVE

01:35:32.993 --> 01:35:33.494
EXITING STAIRS HAVE SEISMIC

01:35:33.561 --> 01:35:34.728
DEFICIENCIES --

01:35:34.795 --> 01:35:36.397
THE PRECAST PANEL SKIN ON THE

01:35:36.464 --> 01:35:37.698
BUILDING --

01:35:37.765 --> 01:35:39.233
WOULD MOST LIKELY NOT --

01:35:39.300 --> 01:35:40.401
WITH WITHSTAND AN EARTHQUAKE

01:35:40.468 --> 01:35:41.469
MEANING YOU COULD ACTUALLY HAVE

01:35:41.535 --> 01:35:43.537
CONCRETE PANELS FALL OFF THE

01:35:43.604 --> 01:35:45.106
BUILDING A STAFF.

01:35:45.172 --> 01:35:45.873
IS GREAT BECAUSE OF THE BENEFITS

01:35:45.940 --> 01:35:46.807
SACRAMENTO --

01:35:46.874 --> 01:35:48.342
ASBESTOS AND LEAD PAINT OR

BUILDING IS NOT ADA COMPLIANT --

01:35:52.480 --> 01:35:54.081
WE NEED TO OPERATE UP THE

01:35:54.148 --> 01:35:55.316
CONTROL LIGHTING SYSTEMS AS WELL

01:35:55.382 --> 01:35:59.820
IT NEEDS A NEW ROOF AND

01:35:59.887 --> 01:36:01.755
ELEVATORS [inaudible]

01:36:01.822 --> 01:36:03.657

DON'T HAVE ANY SPECIFIC CONCERNS

01:36:23.978 --> 01:36:24.712
AS WAS NOTED BY THE DEPARTMENT --

01:36:24.778 --> 01:36:25.279
A COUPLE OF THESE ARE JUST

01:36:25.346 --> 01:36:26.547
BASICALLY CONTINUATIONS OF

01:36:26.614 --> 01:36:28.682
PREVIOUSLY APPROVED PROJECTS AND

01:36:28.749 --> 01:36:29.250

LEGISLATURE --

01:36:30.417 --> 01:36:32.920
EXPECTED THE COST WOULD BE LAST

01:36:32.987 --> 01:36:34.688
THEY WERE CONSIDERED PREVIOUSLY --

01:36:34.755 --> 01:36:35.222
AND THEN THAT RESOURCES

01:36:35.289 --> 01:36:37.391
RENOVATION AS WAS REFERENCED IS --

01:36:37.458 --> 01:36:38.826
IS IDENTIFIED AS A AS A VERY

01:36:38.893 --> 01:36:40.127

COMFORTABLE WITH THAT PLAN

01:36:44.231 --> 01:36:45.299
THAT'S PROBABLY THE NEXT LOGICAL

01:36:45.366 --> 01:36:49.069

I TRIED TO THINK OF THE BEST WAY

02:17:09.688 --> 02:17:10.555
TO EXPLAIN THIS BUT IN A

02:17:10.622 --> 02:17:14.459
MILITARY CONTEXT IT'S LIKE A

02:17:14.526 --> 02:17:15.894
FIFTEEN SIX OFFICER MAY BE DRAWN.

02:17:15.961 --> 02:17:17.696

THEY'RE DRAWN AND TASKED WITH AN

02:17:22.767 --> 02:17:25.036
INVESTIGATION WE DO WHAT WE NEED

02:17:25.103 --> 02:17:27.739

AND THAT'S WHAT THIS BCP IS

02:17:37.882 --> 02:17:39.317
REALLY ABOUT IS TO GET.

02:17:39.384 --> 02:17:40.919
FOLKS RATHER THAN HAVE IT BE
