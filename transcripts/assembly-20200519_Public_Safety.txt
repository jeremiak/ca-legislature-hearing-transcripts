PROBLEM IS DANGER THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATED I AM AND IF YOU'RE IN MEMBERS I JUST WANT TO BE CLEAR- COREY SO GO ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION ARE OPPOSITION. TO THE BILL IS NOT IN REFERENCE TO THE LANGUAGE THAT- REFERENCES SPECIFICALLY PRIVATE DETENTION FACILITIES WE HAVE NO POSITION ON THAT LANGUAGE OUR CONCERN WITH THE BILL IS MERELY CREATION. THE CALIFORNIA DETENTION STANDARDS AND SAFETY WORKING GROUP IN IS UP TO ALL DETENTION FACILITIES WHICH WOULD INCLUDE COUNTY JAILS WE DIDN'T HAVE A POSITION ON THE BILL UNTIL THE MAY SEVENTH AMENDMENTS. WHICH WILL. THE WORKING TO JAIL SO JUST IN REGARD TO THAT I WOULD NOTE THAT EXISTING LAW ESTABLISHES THE MORE STATE COMMUNITY CORRECTIONS ON CHARGES IT WITH. ESTABLISHING MINIMUM STANDARDS FOR LOCAL CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES AND REQUIRES A BOARD TO CONDUCT AT LEAST BY ANY- INSPECTIONS OF LOCAL DETENTION FACILITIES. THE BSD SEE IS ALSO CHARGED WITH EVELOPING RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE IMPROVEMENT OF. JUSTICE AND IN ADDITION TO THE BSE SEE MANY ENTITIES OF DIRECT OR INDIRECT RECITE. JAIL PUTTING. THE ATTORNEY GENERAL COUNTY GRAND JURY THE COURTS JUST TO NAME A FEW. AB THIRTY TWO TWENTY EIGHT AGAIN JUST IN REFERENCE TO THE WORKING GROUP PROVISION CREATES DUPLICATIVE PROCESSES. AND IN SO DOING GREAT TO WORKING GROUP THAT FAILS TO SPECIFICALLY INCLUDE THE BSE SCENE. OR JAIL OR OTHER CORRECTIONAL PROFESSIONALS IN ITS MEMBERSHIP. FOR THESE REASONS IN THOSE STATED ABOVE WE MUST RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE AB THREE TWO TWO EIGHT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. YOU'RE WELCOME ARE THERE ANY OTHER. WITNESSES AND- OPPOSITION NAME AND ORGANIZATION.

YEAH THAT THE CALIFORNIA STATE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION BROUGHT UP HAPPY TO- AGAIN THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT TODAY THE- CALIFORNIA SHERIFF'S ASSOCIATION. MENTIONED THE POTENTIAL FOR OVERLAP OF THE PROPOSED WORKGROUP IT IN THIS BILL THAT I WITH THE BSE SEAT. THERE IS A NARROW POTENTIAL OVERLAP BUT WE THINK THERE ARE DIFFERENT UNIVERSES THAT ARE- WORKGROUP WOULD COVER FOR EXAMPLE TO BE SEC DOESN'T COVER A FOR PROFIT PRIVATE- DETENTION FACILITIES OF ANY TYPE WHETHER PIECE SO IMMIGRATION FACILITIES OR FOR PRIVATE PRISONS. REALLY THE WHOLE PURPOSE OF THIS BILL TO PROVIDE COUNT ABILITY OVERSIGHT ASSURANCES OF HEALTH AND SAFETY AND WELFARE- PROVISIONS TO PROTECT CALIFORNIANS SO- TO THAT AND THERE IS THERE IS NOT OVERLAP SO WE THINK THAT THE OVERLAP IS FINE AT THAT. AND WE SO IT'S IMPORTANT HAVE A MULTI JURISDICTIONAL WORKGROUP WITH SOCIAL SIR IS THE PUBLIC HEALTH TOURNEY GENERAL THE INSPECTOR GENERAL OTHERS TO WORK TOGETHER TO IDENTIFY A MAP AND A PATHWAY FORWARD TO. PROTECT CALIFORNIANS SO- I DID RECEIVE THEIR LETTER I APPRECIATE THEIR CONCERN- I THINK THE OVERLAP IS. PERHAPS THE NOT A SIGNIFICANT. IS NOT SUPER SIGNIFICANT AND THEY ALSO ARE AS AS MENTIONED CLEARLY BY THE REPRESENTATIVE THEY ARE NOT OPPOSING THE ACCOUNTABILITY COMPONENT THAT THEY'RE NOT A SILENT ON THAT IT'S JUST THE WORKGROUP PEACE SO I'M HAPPY TO WORK WITH THEM FOR. IT IS FOR A MEMBER OF THE BEAST YES SEE SEE TO BE INCLUDED IN THE WORK GROUP- CONTEMPLATED BY A. B. THIRTY TWO TWENTY EIGHT SO THERE ARE PATHWAYS TO WORK TOGETHER- TO BE DUPLICATIVE AND- TO. WORK IN HARMONY I DON'T JUST END BY SAYING WE HAVE A DEEPENING CRISIS IN A FOR PROFIT PRIVATE FACILITIES WHETHER BE STILL IMMIGRATION TENSION OR FOR PROFIT PRIVATE PRISONS IT IS IMPORTANT TO HAVE ACCOUNTABILITY AND OVERSIGHT IT IS OUR JOB WITH OUR POLICE POWERS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO PROTECT THE HEALTH SAFETY AND WELFARE OF CALIFORNIANS THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL DOES.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND THANK YOU FOR THE COMMENTS AND TO ALL THE WITNESSES IN SUPPORT pMEMBER YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT- REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE AND REPRODUCTIVE FREEDOM AND BEING PRO CHOICE MEANS CHOICE. AND THE FACT THAT- BOTH MEN AND WOMEN IN OUR PRISON SYSTEM WERE DENIED THE OPPORTUNITY TO BECOME MOTHERS OR TO BE ABLE TO FATHER CHILDREN. IS THAT SOMETHING THAT THE STATE NEEDS-TO RECONCILE WITH AND SO- THAT WE'RE BRINGING THIS BLL BACK AGAIN BECAUSE OF THE IMPORTANCE OF WHAT IT WHAT IT MEANS WHAT IT STANDS FOR. AND TO THE TO SOME OF THE COMMENTS THAT WERE MADE- BY THE WITNESSES OVER THE PHONE BY THIS MONTH BY MISS MYERS EVEN THROUGH COLD IT WE% HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT JUSTICE NEEDS TO BE DONE. AND THAT EVEN WHILE WE RECONCILE THAT COOL BUT HAS ACTUALLY HIGHLIGHTED. SOME OF THE INCREDIBLE INJUSTICES ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHEN IT COMES TO ESSENTIAL WORKERS AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES AND THE RIGHTS TO ACCESS AND RESOURCES. THIS IS STILL A PRIORITY TO OUR STATE. AND SO AGAIN GIVEN GIVEN THOSE- THOSE CHOICES OR LACK OF CHOICES FOR SOME. THIS IS WHY THIS BILL MATTERS THIS IS WHY SB THIRTY TWO IS SIGNIFICANT IN THIS MOMENT IN OUR IN OUR STATE'S HISTORY. AND ALTHOUGH NO MONETARY COMPENSATION CAN ADEQUATELY ADDRESSED THE SUFFERING.

WELCOME BACK THANK YOU YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO PRESENT TODAY ON ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY EIGHT OH EIGHT I WANT TO THANK YOUR COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR ASSISTANCE WITH THIS BILL THIS BILL IS AN EMBODIMENT OF THIS LEGISLATURE'S ONGOING BELIEVE THAT SURVIVORS SHOULD BE PROVIDED WITH PROTECTIONS FOR FURTHER HARM AT THE HANDS OF THEIR ASSAILANTS. UNDER EXISTING LAW THE DEFENDANT MUST BE ELIGIBLE TO SEEK TO HAVE THE CASE AGAINST THEM DISMISSED AFTER SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETING PROBATION ONCE THE CASE AGAINST THEM IS DISMISSED THE LAW SAYS THAT THE DEFENDANT IS RELEASED FROM PENALTIES AND DISABILITIES RESULTING FROM THE OFFENSE HOWEVER EXISTING LAW ALSO PROVIDES SEVERAL EXCEPTIONS TO THAT PRINCIPLE INCLUDING POSSESSION OF A FIREARM AND HOLDING ELECTED OFFICE. IN TWO THOUSAND AND ELEVEN THIS LEGISLATURE PROVIDED OUR CRIMINAL COURTS WITH THE ABILITY TO ISSUE PROTECTIVE ORDERS TERMS UP TO TEN YEARS FOR CERTAIN CRIMES INCLUDING PLASTIC VIOLENCE AND STALKING REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE CONVICTION IS A FELONY OR MISDEMEANOR. HOWEVER IT IS CLEAR WHETHER PROTECT ORDER. UNDER THE LAW REMAIN IN PLACE AFTER DEFENDED HAS A CASE AGAINST THEM DISMISSED AFTER COMPLETING PROBATION. AS A RESULT OF THIS AMBIGUITY IN THE LOS SEVERAL JUDGES IN LA COUNTY HAVE HAD ISSUES HAVE HAD TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE WHEN DECIDING WHETHER JUST TO DISMISS THE CASE AGAINST THE DEFENDANT WHO HAS COMPLETED PROBATION. AB TWENTY OH EIGHT PROVIDES A BALANCED APPROACH THAT ALLOWS FOR THE CRIMINAL CASE AGAINST THE ASSAILANT TO BE DISMISSED SO THEY CAN SEEK REHABILITATION OPTIONS LIKE APPLYING FOR JOBS WAS STILL PROVIDING THE SURVIVOR WITH THE PROTECTIONS THAT THEY BOTH NEED. AND THEY RIGHTFULLY DESERVE. FOR THESE REASONS COLLEAGUES I RESPECTFULLY ASK FREE AYE VOTE ON ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY EIGHT OH EIGHT. WITH ME TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. IS LESLIE CLAIMED ON BEHALF OF OUR SPONSOR LOS ANGELES DISTRICT ATTORNEY JACKIE LACEY. AND PALE SEEN HA ON BEHALF OF THE PEACE OFFICE- PEACE OVER VIOLENCE. THANK YOU. MISSED MODERATOR COULD YOU HAVE OUR SUPPORT WITNESSES NOW TESTIFY. AB TWENTY EIGHT OH EIGHT CERVANTES. HELLO HELLO. HEAR ME WE CAN HEAR YOU NOW. OKAY THANK YOU GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I'M LESS INCLINED YES IF IT HAD THAT THE OF THE FAMILY VIOLENCE DIVISION OF THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE. WE RE THE PROUD SPONSOR OF AB TWENTY EIGHT OH EIGHT. PROTECT THE BORDERS ARE EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TOOL USED IN THE PROTECTION OF VICTIMS OF CRIME PARTICULARLY IN CASES INVOLVING DOMESTIC VIOLENCEAND TALKING. TO THE INTRINSIC ONGOING NATURE OF THE RELATIONSHIP. IT DOESN'T MATTER WHETHER THE INCIDENT AMOUNTS TO A MISDEMEANOR OR A FELONY ANY ACT OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CAN QUICKLY ESCALATED INTO A VIOLENT FELONY INCLUDING ACT OF GUN VIOLENCE. I HAVE CERTAINLY SEEN THAT HAPPEN IN MY TWENTY FIVE YEARS OF EXPERIENCE. THE CAPTAIN ORDERED IT BECOMES THE RESOURCES THEY NEED TO KEEP THEIR ABUSERS AWAY. PROTECTIVE ORDER CAN LITERALLY BE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LIFE AND DEATH. THE BILL WE ARE PROPOSING IS NOT ADD ANY MORE RESTRICTIONS IT'S SIMPLY CLARIFIED A VAGUENESS INTO LAW AS IT IS CURRENTLY WRITTEN. COURT ALREADY HAVE THE AUTHORITY AND THE PRESIDENT IF THE FINAL PROTECTIVE ORDERS UPON CONVICTION IN DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. STOPPING AT THE BY TECH CRIME THAT ARE VALID FOR UP TO TEN YEARS IN BOTH FELONY AND MISDEMEANOR CASES. ALTHOUGH THE TEN YEAR PROTECTIVE ORDER IS MOST OFTEN OBTAINED IN FELONY CASES THERE ARE SOME MISDEMEANOR CASES WHERE I CAN YOUR PROTECTIVE ORDER HAS BEEN CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE CASES INVOLVING MULTIPLE INCIDENTS OF ABUSE PRIOR HISTORY OF ABUSE. OR INJURIES THAT ARE QUITE YET AGAIN DON'T QUITE BY THE LEVEL OF THE FELONY CHARGE. IMPORTANTLY QUIRK HAVE THE JURISDICTION TO MODIFY OR TERMINATE THOSE PROTECTIVE ORDER WITHIN THE TENURE OF THEIR INSURANCE. AND NOTHING NFL CHANGES THAT. CURRENTLY WHEN A DEFENDANT MOVED TO HAVE THEIR CASE THICKNESS UNDER PENAL CODE SECTION TWELVE OH THREE POINT FOUR OR TWELVE A THREE POINT FOUR EIGHT NOTHING IN THE SECOND ADDRESSED THE HOUSE SUPPORT SHOULD HANDLE THE ISSUE OF THE UNEXPIRED PROTECTIVE ORDER. DID HE NEED DIFFERENT BILL CLARIFIES THAT WANT TO COURT GRANTS DISMISSAL UNDER TWELVE A THREE POINT FOUR AND TWELVE A THREE POINT FOR A- PROTECTIVE ORDER PRESUMPTIVELY REMAIN VALID UNTIL ITS EXPIRATION DATE. FOR THE PROTECTION OF THE VICTIM WELL IT COULD WHILE AT THE SAME TIME GIVING THE PORTS THE DISCRETION TO MODIFY OR TERMINATE THE ORDER. IT PRESENT INFORMATION. I THANK ACTION. IF YOU ARRIVE IN. INDIVIDUAL JUDGE ON YOUR DEFIED TO HAND THAT IF YOU. IT IS EVEN A THAT I. MANY JUDGES WILL APPROVED PROTECTIVE ORDER ROOM IN A- MANY THE A YOU HAVE NOT THE FACT ALL BUT THE PROTECTIVE ORDER REMAIN IN FOR IF. LEADING AND WITHOUT IN THAT HERE FOR MAKE BE. TO A PROTECTIVE ORDER. IN OTHER INSTANCES COURT MAY FEEL THEY MUST GIVE MISSED THE EXISTING. ORDER IF THEY DISMISSED THE CASE. AB TWENTY EIGHT OH EIGHT GIVE THE COURT GUIDANCE ON IT THE STORY AND PUT THE DEFENDANT ON NOTICE THAT HE OR SHE IS STILL SUBJECT TO THE ORDER UNLESS AND UNTIL THE COURT TERMINATE OR MODIFY THE ORDER. IT FURTHER GET THAT BIG THEM PEACE OF MIND NO THE PROTECTIVE ORDER IS IN QUITE. ANY SUGGESTION THAT A VICTIM COULD SIMPLY GET A SEVERAL RESTRAINING ORDER. IF THEY REALLY WANTED WANTED LOT. NAVIGATING THE COURT SYSTEM IS DON INCOME MOST LAY PEOPLE. IT FOURTH OF THE VICTIM I HAVE TO RE LIVE THE ATROCITIES THEY'VE ALREADY EXPERIENCE. BOB HOPING AND PRAYING THE JUDGE WILL TRANSPORT. AND MOST IMPORTANTLY AS EXPRESSED ME BY DOMESTIC SURVIVOR. HERE THAT GOING BACK TO COURT YEARS LATER WELL AS SHE PUT IT HOPE THE HORNET'S NEST AND REFOCUS THE ABUSER ON THE VICTIM. AB TWENTY EIGHT OH EIGHT HELP ENSURE THAT THE LATE LEGISLATIVE INTENT BEHIND TENURE PROTECTIVE ORDER LAWS ISN'T PUT IN JEOPARDY BY ADDRESSING THE BIGNESS CURRENTLY FOUND IN TWELVE OH THREE POINT FOUR AND TWELVE OH THREE POINT FOUR EIGHT.

I WANTED YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FOR AND IT'S SOUNDED LIKE I FROM SOME OF WITNESSES AND THEN ALL FOR. UP WHAT WOULD IN THE AND NOW THAT THERE COULD BE BE OFFERED FOR A MAN AND I WAS HOPE THAT MAYBE YOU CAN ADDRESS YOUR CALL SOME OF THE- THAT WERE RAISED BY THE OPPOSITION. I THINK THE- SOME OF THE THINGS THAT ARE CONCERNING IS THE ABILITY FOR A JUDGE TO ESSENTIALLY RE OPEN A CASE. AND THE METAL AROUND AND ACTUALLY CHANGE THE TERMS. AND THERE COULD BE CONVERGENCE TO BOTH CIVIL JUDGMENTS AND CIVIL ORDERS WHICH IN FACT YOU KNOW EVEN AFTER- I'M A CASES CLOSE WOULD STAY WITH THE DEFENDANT FOR TEN YEARS ON TOP OF THE FACT THAT- A JUDGE WOULD HAVE THE DISCRETION TO REVOKE PROBATION. SO I AM HOPING THAT MAYBE YOU CAN ADDRESS OME OF THOSE CONCERNS- AS THEY ARE ONES THAT I ALSO THANK YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. THIS. ABOUT THIS YOU MAY THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER CHAIR AND THINK YOU TO COME MEMBERS I DO WANT TO JUST RESTATE THAT AB TWENTY EIGHT OH EIGHT SIX TO CLARIFY THE OUR CURRENT EXISTING LAW- IT WHEN IT COMES TO THE VAGUENESS OF THE EXISTING LAW. SO SURVIVORS SHOULD BE ABLE TO RELY ON THE PROTECTIVE ORDER THEY SUCCESSFULLY PUT IN PLACE AGAINST THEIR ASSAILANT REGARDLESS OF THE DISPOSITION OF THE ASSAILANTS PUNISHMENT. NOW AS IT RELATES TO YOUR CONCERNS WE HAVE WE DID RECEIVE LAY OPPOSITION A COUPLE DAYS AGO ONE WHICH WE WERE WILLING TO WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION TO GET TO A POINT WHERE WE COULD COME TOGETHER. AS WHAT I TRY TO DO AND ANY BILLS- THEY COME BEFORE THIS BODY. AT WHEN IT COMES TO THE TEN YEAR PROTECTIVE ORDER AND AS YOU SAY YOU ASKED THE QUESTION THE CRIMINAL TO CIVIL. RESTRAINING ORDER TO CONVERT THAT I WOULD ACTUALLY. YOU KNOW I DON'T HAVE A DIRECT RESPONSE AT THE MOMENT BUT I KNOW THAT THE FOLKS ON THE LINE TO BE ON THE LINE THEY- HAVE THE EXPERIENCE AND THEY WERE SHARING WITH ME THAT THAT IS NOT THE CASE THAT THAT CANNOT BE DONE HOWEVER. I CAN'T SPEAK TO THAT- I KNOW THAT THEY CAN THEMSELVES BUT GIVEN. I KNOW THE TIME THAT WE HAVE I'M MORE THAN HAPPY TO GET BACK TO YOU. AS YOU. HAVE REQUESTED ON THIS MATTER- BUT AGAIN WE ARE JUST LOOKING AT HOW WE CAN CONTINUE TO PROTECT SURVIVORS- IN CASE THAT YOU KNOW. THIS IS JUST MESSED A CASE IS DISMISSED. JUDGES EXISTING LAW WHEN UNDER EXISTING LAW JUDGES MAY DENY MOTIONS TO DISMISS THE CASE AGAINST THE SAILING ON ORDERED TO LEAVE THE PROTECTIVE. I ORDER IN PLACE RIGHT NOW SO THIS WILL PREVENT AN ASSAILANT FROM AXIS SEEN MANY GOVERNMENT SERVICES- AND IN ANY CASE EVEN APPLYING FOR A JOB SO INSTEAD OF FORCING A JUDGE TO MAKE THAT DIFFICULT DECISION. WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT THE CHORDS WE LEAVE IT TO THE COURTS TO PROTECT- TO KEEP THE PROTECTIVE ORDER IN PLACE WHILE ALSO DISMISSING THE CASE AGAINST THE ASSAILANT SO THIS IS TRYING TO FIND THIS MIDDLE GROUND. THEY WILL WORK YOU KNOW TO PROTECT OF COURSE- THE SURVIVOR BUT ALSO LOOKING OUT YOU KNOW WHAT WE HAVE IN PLACE RIGHT NOW SO AGAIN I AM-MORE THAN HAPPY TO HAVE A SEPARATE CONVERSATION SHOULD THIS BILL MOVE FORWARD- TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN. PERHAPS COME TO. A MIDDLE GROUND WITH THE OPPOSITION. THAT IS WHAT I AM WILLING TO DO. OKAY WE HAVE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS COMMITTEE. THE CARD COMMENT THAT THE I'VE GREATER FOR THE VICTIM FOR THAT THIS BILL TAKE. EFFORT THE WOMEN AGAIN THE PROBLEMATIC PEOPLE AND- HARDLY SUPPORTED AND MUCH OF FOR THIS THANK YOU. IN AND I WANT THANK YOU TO FOR IT FOR I'D- OTHERS WHO WORK ABOUT THE OTHER SIDE BUT ALSO WANT TO MAKE IT TO COPY. THAT WE LOOK AT THIS AND MAKE IT REALLY DIFFICULT FOR VICTIMS. TO BE ABLE TO GET SOME SOME PROTECTIONS AND SO I THINK THAT'S WHAT MR LACKEY IS TALKING ABOUT- WHILE AT THE SAME TIME PROTECTING OTHERS THAT THIS BILL DOESN'T DO ANYTHING ELSE SO. THE FACT THAT YOU ARE WILLING TO WORK WITH THE OTHER SIDE MAKES IT MAKES IS REALLY ENCOURAGING AND- BUT I ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE WE DON'T BECOME TOO BUREAUCRATIC BUT TO LEGAL OR TO WHATEVER. AT AND IT MAKES IT EVEN MORE DIFFICULT FOR VICTIMS TO BE PROTECTED I THINK WE ALL SHARE KIND OF THE SAME THING SO WITH THAT THAT THE CHURCH RECOMMEND AYE VOTE. REALLY BECAUSE OF HOW WILLING YOU ARE TO. TO WORK WITH THE OTHER SIDE. MAY CALL THE ROLL. AND AB TWENTY EIGHT OH EIGHT CERVANTES THE MOTION IS TO PASS JONES SAWYER CHEN SIR I LACKEY LACKEY AYE BARRICADE HAN DEEP DEEP I KAMLAGER. CAN'T. FOR MORE.

NOW WE HAVE UP NUMBER SEVEN MISTER THAT WOULD BE FAR UNSAFE HAND GUNS. GOOD MORNING MR IN CALI SEPT YEAR AND OF TWO EIGHT FORTY. THIS BILL WILL ASSIST LAW ENFORCEMENT AND SOLVING GUN RELATED CRIMES AND REDUCE THE NUMBER OF ACCIDENTAL GUN DEATHS AND INJURIES IN OUR STATE. IN CALIFORNIA AS THIS COMMITTEE KNOWS MANY GUN CRIMES GO UNSOLVED BECAUSE NO MATCHES MADE BETWEEN EVIDENCE AT THE SCENE AND A SUSPECT. IN FACT NO REST FOR MADE IT IN HALF OF ALL HOMICIDES. MY CRISTINA BEING IS A CRIME SOLVING TOOL IMPRINTS A UNIQUE STAMP ON A BULLET CASING THROUGH THE FIRING PIN ALLOWING LAW ENFORCEMENT TO DEFINITIVELY LINK. BULLET CASINGS TO A GUN. THIRTEEN YEARS AGO OUR LEGISLATURE PASSED A LAW REQUIRING NEW FIREARMS TO INCLUDE THIS FORENSIC MICRO STAMPING TECHNOLOGY. ARE BILL TODAY WOULD EASE COMPLIANCE FOR MANUFACTURERS BY REQUIRING NEW FIREARMS MY CRISTINA IN ONLY ONE PLACE ON THE INTERIOR OF A FIREARM AS OPPOSED TO TWO PLACES. AS REQUIRED IN THE TWO THOUSAND SEVEN LAW. IN ADDITION THIS BILL WOULD ENSURE THAT ANY NEW FIREARM SOLD IN CALIFORNIA WILL FINALLY HAPPY CHAMBER LOAD INDICATOR TO SIGNIFY WHEN A FIREARM IS LOADED. AS WELL AS A MAGAZINE DISCONNECT MECHANISM TO PREVENT A GUN FROM FIRING WHEN A DETACHABLE MAGAZINE IS REMOVED. THESE ARE CONSUMER SAFETY PROTECTIONS CRITICAL FOR PREVENTING ACCIDENTAL SHOOTINGS. FOR EACH NEW COMPLIANT HANDGUN MODEL THAT'S INTRODUCED THIS BILL WOULD DIRECT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL TO REMOVE THREE PREVIOUSLY GRANDFATHER HANDGUN MODELS FROM THE ROSTER OF GUNS ALLOWED TO BE SOLD IN OUR STATE. IN THE MIDST OF THIS PANDEMIC GUN VIOLENCE UNFORTUNATELY STILL PERSISTS ON THE STREETS WITH VIOLENT CRIMES IN HOMES WITH DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND SUICIDES. AND TWO ACCIDENTS FROM IMPROPERLY STORED GUNS. THIS BILL WILL EQUIP LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES WITH THE TOOLS THEY REQUIRE TO QUICKLY SOFT ON CRIME IN OUR COMMUNITIES. AS WELL AS REDUCE ACCIDENTAL GUN DEATHS AND INJURIES. WITHOUT A LIKE TO TURN IT OVER TO A WITNESSES WE HAVE HOPEFULLY ON THE LINE- THE DA OF ALAMEDA COUNTY NANCY A MAILING. AND THE PRESIDENT OF BRADY CALIFORNIA MEDI SCOTT. THANK YOU OF. THE OPEN PRO FOR WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. WATER READER MORNING.

THANK MAGICALLY OUT IT. NEXT D. EIGHT NANCY MALLON. I RECEIVED A TEXT SAYING THAT SHE IS APPARENTLY ON HOLD SO HOPEFULLY THE OPERATOR CAN LETTER THROUGH THE WHOLE MODERATOR COULD YOU THE MODERATE. COULD YOU PLEASE LET THE STEAM. DISTRIBUTOR THE FROM ALAMEDA. ONE MOMENT I SEE YOU'RE NOW. THE MALIBU'S GO AND THANK YOU GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS- I AM THE OF THE O'MALLEY THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY FROM ALAMEDA COUNTY AND CO SPONSOR OF AB TWENTY EIGHT FORTY SEVEN AND IN STRONG SUPPORT BECAUSE THIS BILL WILL STRENGTHEN THE UNPAID CAN GOOD ACTORS WHICH IS CRITICAL TO PUBLIC SAFETY IN CALIFORNIA. AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHIU JUST DESCRIBE THE BILL WILL ALIGN FIREARMS MANUFACTURING REQUIREMENT AT AND UPDATE THAT CALIFORNIA'S UNSAFE HANDGUN ACT. BOTH OF THESE BILLS IN THE PAST ABOUT THE BILL IN THE PAST WAS PASSED WITH THE SUPPORT OF ALL LAW ENFORCEMENT. AS STATE AS STATED BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER TO NEWLY DEVELOPED SEMI AUTOMATIC PISTOL MODELS WILL ETCH MICHAEL STAMPING CHARACTERS ON ONE PLACE RATHER THAN TO ON THE INTERIOR OF THE FIREARM. BECAUSE MICHAEL STAMPING CREATES A UNIQUE ARRAY OF CHARACTERS. THAT WILL LINK THE SPENT TALENT CARTRIDGE CASING TO A PARTICULAR FIREARM AND MONTROSE MO WILL HAVE THE TOOLS TO CONNECT BENT CARTRIDGES FROM CRIME SCENES TO THE FIRE I'M FROM WHICH THE BULLET WAS FIRED. MY CHRISTIANITY WILL IDENTIFY THE MAKE MODEL AND SERIAL NUMBER OF THE FIREARM WHICH WILL ALLOW LAW ENFORCEMENT TO LINK NOT ONLY TO THAT PARTICULAR CRIME BUT TO MULTIPLE CRIME SCENE. AS WE HAVE SEEN. THIS BILL MAKES COMMONSENSE CHANGES TO ENHANCE TOOLS THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT HAS. TO IDENTIFIES SHOOTER AND QUIRK AND INVOLVED IN A CRIME. OUR RESEARCH AND NATIONAL RICHARD RICHARD TELLS US THAT MOST FIREARMS USED IN CRIMES OR SOLO ON. WHICH MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO SOLVE CRIME. HELLO MY OFFICE IS DONE A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF RESEARCH ON GUNS AND GUN pVIOLENCE. WE LOOK AT EIGHT HUNDRED SIXTY TWO CASES IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN. THAT WAS ONLY A PORTION OF THE GUN INVOLVED CASES. HAPPEN THOSE CASES ARE REGISTERED TO PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA BUT THE OTHER HALF WERE NOT. AND WE HAD TO RUN EACH CASE DONE BY GUN IN ORDER TO AID IN SOLVING THE CRIME. THIS IS NOT PRACTICAL AND IT'S NOT EFFICIENT BUT WITH MICRO STAFFING. THAT WE WILL HAVE A BETTER OPPORTUNITY FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT EFFORT DISTRICT ATTORNEYS. TO IDENTIFY THE CRIMINALS WHO COMMITTED THE CRIME TO APPREHEND THEM AND HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE. MICHAEL STOPPING BULLETS WILL. WILL IMPROVE THE DATABASE THAT CAN REGISTERTHE MIKE FOR STAMP OF A FIREARM FOR ALL THE FOR CRIME SOLVING RATHER THAN HAVING TO DO. CASE BY CASE DONE BY DONE MY OFFICE IS DEDICATED TO COMBATING THE EPIDEMIC OF GUN VIOLENCE THAT PLAGUED THEIR COMMUNITIES DROP COUNTY THE STATE AND THE NATION. AND THE FIRE RELATED CRIMES HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON VICTIMS ON FAMILIES AND COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE. AB TWENTY EIGHT FORTY SEVEN DIRECTLY ADVANCES PUBLIC SAFETY AND- WE NOTE THE DEVASTATION OF GUN VIOLENCE IN OUR COMMUNITY.

GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIRMAN IF KATHY WINS CAN YOU HEAR ME YES SIR CAN. GOOD MORNING- I'M REPRESENTING THAT CALIFORNIA FOURTEENTH WHAT THE OUTDOORS WORKING COALITION INSOFAR CLUB INTERNATIONAL IN OPPOSITION TODAY. WELL MICHAEL STAMPING IS IN THE ON STATE HANDGUN ACTED HAS NO FACTUAL RELATIONSHIP TO HAND GUN SAFETY IT IS A MERE PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS. IT SEEMS THAT THE LOGICAL THAT ADDING UP SEMI AUTOMATIC WITH MICHAEL CAMPING WOULD REQUIRE THREE HANDGUNS TO BE REMOVED THE BILL REQUIRES THAT HAND GOT SHALL BE REMOVED IN REVERSE ORDER WHICH DOESN'T APPEAR TO BE BASED ON ANY SPECIFIC RATIONALE. DOJ WEBSITE INDICATES THAT ARE A HUNDRED EIGHT HUNDRED AND EIGHTEEN HANDGUNS ON THE LEFT. BUT THE PROBABLY LET'S LISTING DOES NOT SHOW WHICH CAN GO WOULD BE REMOVED FROM THE WEST FIRST. AND NOT THE MANUFACTURE COULD BE REMOVING EITHER A COMPETITOR OR THEMSELVES FROM THE LEFT WHY WOULD ANY BUSINESS DO THAT. CAN THE AUTHOR INDICATE FROM THE CURRENT LAN. WOULD HAND GUNS WOULD BE REMOVED WILL THIS BE TRANSPARENT TO THE PUBLIC OR WILL THE PUBLIC LEARNED ABOUT IT WHEN THEY TRIED TO PURCHASE A HANDGUN. IT WILL MAKE THE DETERMINATION THAT THE DATA SO CURRENTLY EXIST IN THE DLJ THEM IT. BILL BY THAT WISHING AT TO ONE RATIO OF REMOVAL LIMIT ACCESS TO SAFE AND GUN TO THE PUBLIC FUNDS. UP LIKE. WHAT FOR THE BACHELOR. START THAT MIKE STAMP IS. AND RELY A- BUT THERE TO GET BETWEEN HAVING THE- TO EDGE CHARACTERS ON THE TIP OF A FIRE PIN. AND WEATHER SO DO I AS WELL AN UPPER DECK AND BY. AND WHETHER IT TO ONE EDGING IT'S STILL NOT WORKABLE. THE ADDITION OF MICHAEL STAMPING TO A CURRENTLY LISTED AS BILL WOULD MAKE THE PISTOL THEIR NEW MODEL THAT WOULD HAVE TO UNDERGO NEW SAFETY TESTING INCREASING COSTS TO CONSUMERS. IT SEEMS THAT MEASURE COULD INCREASE LITIGATION POTENTIAL SINCE THE CRITERIA TO REMOVE. A HANDGUN OF ARBITRARY BUT WOULD CREATE A PUBLIC PERCEPTION THAT THE HANDGUN HAS THE UNFOUNDED STIGMA OF BEING UNSAFE. IF IT WAS REMOVED. IN CLOSING THE BILL DOESN'T HAVE ANY THE PLAN BENEFIT TO CAN. AND THE NUMBER ONE ISSUE RATE BY FORTUNATE CONSUMERS IF THE DESIRE TO SEE A MORE EXPANSIVE LEFT RATHER THAN A DIMINISHING OFFERING. WHICH WILL BE THE END RESULT A BABY TWENTY EIGHT FORTY SEVEN. WE URGE A NO VOTE ON THE BILL AND I WANT TO THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY AND I WISH EVERYONE WELL DURING THE CHALLENGING TIME. THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENT. SORRY ANY WITNESSES. IN OPPOSITION NAME AN ORGANIZATION. GERMAN YOUR HEARING YES. THIS IS YOUR GROUP OF THE NUMBERS ON SPEAKING ON THE OUT THE CALIFORNIA. SORRY BUT NOT GO AHEAD I'M SORRY. ALSO MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS ORDER BECAUSE WE CANNOT BE OUT OF THE CALIFORNIA RIVAL DISASSOCIATION OUR MEMBERS ROCK CALIFORNIA I'M HERE TO EXPRESS OUR STRONG OPPOSITION TO ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY EIGHT FORTY SEVEN. AB TWENTY EIGHT FORTY SEVEN WILL REVISE THE CRITERIA FUND STATE HAND GUNS BY REQUIRING THE MICHAEL STAMP TO BE IMPRINTED ON ONE PLACEMENT HANG AND REQUIRE THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE FOR EVERYONE ADDED FOR THREE TO BE REMOVED. LOW J. MAINTAIN THE ROSTER'S. HANDGUNS FOR CALIFORNIA HANG ON IS NOT ON THAT ROSTER CANNOT BE PURCHASED FROM A LICENSED DEALER. TOOK PLACE ON THE ROSTER HEARING AND MUST BE SUBMITTED TO THE DOJ FOR TESTING AND SATISFY CERTAIN SAFETY REQUIREMENTS. CLEARLY LESS THAN EIGHT HUNDRED GUNS ON THIS LIST A DECREASE FROM A HIGH OF FOURTEEN HUNDRED. WE ALL KNOW IN TWO DOLLARS SEVEN GOVERNOR SCHWARZENEGGER SIGNED FOURTEEN SEVENTY ONE THAT REQUIRED SEMI AUTOMATIC PISTOL TO BE QUICK BUT MICHAEL STAMPING TECHNOLOGY. THE LEGISLATURE FOR THE PROVIDED THIS REQUIREMENT BECOME EFFECTIVE WHEN THE DOJ CERTIFIES. TECHNOLOGY USED TO CREATE A MICHAEL STAMPED IMPRINT. IS AVAILABLE FOR MORE THAN ONE MANUFACTURER NOT ENCUMBERED BY ANY PATHWAYS DIRECTIONS. THIS CERTIFICATION DID NOT HAPPEN UNTIL TWENTY THIRTEEN. THIS TECHNOLOGY IS A MICROSD AMPLE ARRAY OF CHARACTERS THAT IDENTIFY MAKE MODEL AND SERIAL NUMBER OF THE PISTOL. AND CURRENT CALIFORNIA LAW REQUIRES MEAN PRINTED ON TWO OR MORE PLACES ON THE INTER SERVICE OR INTERNAL WORKING PARTS OF PISTOL. AND THAT THEY ARE TRANSFERRED. BY THE CARD FROM CARTRIDGE THAT FAR ONE IS FOR. GEN RICHARD ONLY THIRTEEN MENU ATTEMPTED TO INFORM THE TECHNOLOGY TO BASIC YET DRAMATIC INCONSISTENCIES THAT SPEAK TO MICHAEL STAMPEDE INTENDED PURPOSE. FORENSIC SCIENCE CONFIRM THAT THE MARKS LEFT BY THE INTERNAL COMPONENTS OF THE GUN ARE ALTERED AFTER NORMAL USE AND WHICH CAN BE RENDERED THE MICHAEL STAMP ON RELIABLE. NOT TO MENTION A CRIMINAL OF THE FILE COULD EASILY. DEFEAT THE MICHAEL STAMP ITSELF. IMPORTANCIA IS THE TECHNOLOGY WERE VIABLE THE PRICE OF PRODUCTION WOULD SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE THE COST TO FARMS CONSTRUED CONCERN WITH. THE GUARANTEE THAT THE CORRECT PARTS FOR EXAMPLE FIRING PINS AND SLIDES WITH EXACTLY MATCHES CHERYL NUMBER OF THE HANDGUN FRAME DURING MANUFACTURING PROCESS IS OUR PRIMARY CONCERN. WELL THEN THE SIMPLE COST OF APPLYING THE MICHAEL STAMP TECHNOLOGY. FURTHER AB TWENTY EIGHT FORTY SEVEN LOSE THREE FIREARMS FROM THE ROSTER THAT ARE NOT IN COMPLYING WITH KURT MICHAEL STAMP REQUIREMENTS FOR EACH ONE NEW FARM ARE ADDED TO THE ROSTER. THIS RECORD WAS JUST NOT BOUGHT OUT. THE ASPECT OF TWENTY FORTY SEVEN WILL FURTHER COMPOUND THE SITUATION BY REMOVING THESE THREE TIME TESTED AND DESIRED FIREARMS FROM THE ROSTER BY THE RELEASE DATE WHICH ISN'T DO NOT AT ALL TAKES INTO ACCOUNT THE QUALITY OR INTENDED APPLICATION THE FARM THIS ONLY PULL THE REDUCED AVAILABILITY OF AFFORDABLE WHILE RELIABLE HANDGUNS IN CALIFORNIA. THE MICHAEL STANDING RECORD ALONE HINDERS MARKET FORCES ANDLIMITS DOT POLAND TECHNOLOGICALLY SUPERIOR FIREARM TO CALIFORNIANS. REMOVAL FARMS FURTHER DEVASTATED THE FREE MARKETPLACE FOR QUALITY PRODUCTS RISE TO THE TOP. YOUR OVER PRICE MARKET PRODUCTS FAILED TO SAVE YOUR CALIFORNIANS IS AT THE VERY FOUNDATION OF OUR ORGANIZATION AND HAS BEEN. CONSISTENT GOAL TO WORK WITH FOR COMMON SENSE SOLUTIONS REGARDING THE ISSUE OF CRIME AND FARM OWNERSHIP. THIS CAN BE DONE- EVER WITHOUT SACRIFICING CALIFORNIANS CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS ON ABILITY A LAW ABIDNG CITIZENS PROTECT THEIR FAMILIES AND OPERATE A LAWFUL BUSINESS AND PROVIDE FIREARMS ARE SAFE AFFORDABLE PRICE TO ALL CALIFORNIANS. FOR THE FOREGOING REASONS THE CALIFORNIA RIFLE PISTOL SO SHE SHE STANDS IN STRONG OPPOSITION TO TWENTY FORTY SEVEN AND URGES YOUR NOBLE ON THIS BAD PIECE OF LEGISLATION.

DEEP KAMLAGER KAMLAGER I KALLIO DARIO I SANTIAGO. WICKS THAT MEASURES ON COLONIES TO MEASURES ON CALL. THANK YOU. NOW WE HAVE ITEM NUMBER NINE ASSEMBLYMEMBER GABRIEL. THAT'S ANOTHER FIREARMS GUN VIOLENCE RESTRAINING ORDER CORRECT. AB TWENTY SIX SEVENTEEN. WHENEVER YOU'RE READY YOU MAY BEGIN GREAT STATE THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS I AM PLEASED TODAY 2% AB TWENTY SIX SEVENTEEN A BILL THAT WILL HELP TO SAVE LIVES BY STRENGTHENING AND CLARIFYING CALIFORNIA LAW REGARDING GUN VIOLENCE RESTRAINING ORDERS. MOST SIGNIFICANTLY AB TWENTY SIX SEVENTEEN WILL HELP TO ENSURE THAT CALIFORNIA HONORS AND ENFORCES LAWFUL G. VIEIRA WAS THAT ARE ISSUED IN OTHER STATES SO THAT THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN DEEMED A THREAT TO THEMSELVES OR OTHERS CANNOT EASILY OBTAIN FIREARMS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AS MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE NOW A G. R. O. S. JUDICIAL ORDER THAT ALLOWS LAW ENFORCEMENT TO TEMPORARY REAL TEMPORARILY REMOVE FIREARMS. FROM AN INDIVIDUAL WHO POSES AN IMMINENT RISK OF HARM TO THEMSELVES OR OTHERS. WHEN USED TO THEIR FULL POTENTIAL JEEP HEROES ARE POWERFUL TOOL THAT CAN PREVENT MASS SHOOTINGS AND SUICIDES AND SAVE LIVES. LAST YEAR THE LEGISLATURE UNANIMOUSLY PASSED AND GOVERNOR NEW SOME SIGNED INTO LAW AB ONE SIX FOUR BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER CERVANTES. WHICH PROHIBITS INDIVIDUALS IN CALIFORNIA FROM PURCHASING OR POSSESSING FIREARMS. IF THEY'RE SUBJECT TO RESTRAINING ORDER IN ANOTHER STATE FOR ACTS INCLUDING HARASSMENT WORKPLACE VIOLENCE SCHOOL VIOLENCE AND DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IF THE OUT OF STATE ORDER INCLUDES A FARM PROHIBITION. AB TWENTY SIX SEVENTEEN BUILT ON THAT PRIOR LEGISLATON AND THE FEDERAL VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT BY EXTENDING THAT VERY SAME PROHIBITION TO INDIVIDUALS ARE SUBJECT TO AN OUT OF STATE TV ARE OUT. THIS EXTENSION IS A MODEST AND PRACTICAL TEP THAT WILL ENSURE CONSISTENCY AND CLARITY IN THE LAW AND HELP KEEP CALIFORNIANS SAFE. ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE GUNS AND GUN VIOLENCE TOO OFTEN CROSS STATE LINES. INDEED LAST YEAR'S MATCH SHOOTING AT THE GILROY GARLIC FESTIVAL WAS A PAINFUL REMINDER THAT INTERSTATE COOPERATION ON GUN VIOLENCE IS ESSENTIAL TO SAVING LIVES. THIS BILL SUPPORTED BY A BROAD COALITION OF LAW ENFORCEMENT AND GUN VIOLENCE PREVENTION GROUPS INCLUDING THE CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION THE CALIFORNIA STATE SERVICE ASSOCIATION. THE DIFFERENCE LAWCENTER THE BRADY CAMPAIGN MOMS DEMAND ACTION AND MARK FOR OUR LIVES. WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THIS LEGISLATION ARE TIFFANY MATTHEWS LEGISLATIVE ADVOCATE FROM THE CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION. AND ALEXANDER WALKER GRIFFIN POLITICAL DIRECTOR FOR MARK FOR A LIVES THANK YOU AND RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU. OF MISTER MODERATOR WHENEVER YOU'RE READY FOR UP TO WITNESSES. AND YOUR LIFE TO OPEN PLEASE GO AHEAD. MACINNES ON HALF THE CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR COMMITTEE MEMBER AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER GABRIEL FOR THE CHANCE TO PROVE THAT AND THE POOR AND AB TWENTY SIX SEVENTEEN. WELL CALIFORNIA HAS RECOGNIZED OTHER FORMS A PROTECTIVE ORDER IS. LIKE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE RESTRAINING ORDERS FROM OTHER STATE. IT IS NOT PROVIDED AUTHORITY TO ENFORCE TV ARE ISSUED BY OTHER STATE. HEROES ARE IMPORTANT TOOL IN REDUCING GUN VIOLENCE. BY ALLOWING THE TEMPORARY REMOVAL OF FIREARMS FROM AN INDIVIDUAL WHERE THEIR STUFF LIKE EVIDENCE THAT SUCH PERSON MAY BE A DANGER TO HIMSELF OR OTHERS. NO REASON IN% AN INDIVIDUAL SUBJECT TO AN OUT OF STATE TV ARE- OR SIMILAR ORDER SHOULD HAVE A GUN IN CALIFORNIA. THIS BILL WOULD IMPOSE CALIFORNIA'S EXISTING FIVE YEAR PROHIBITION ON POSSESSION OF FIREARMS OR AMMUNITION ON ANY INDIVIDUAL WHO VIOLATE THE VISION. COMMONSENSE PUBLIC SAFETY LEGISLATION THAT RIGHT INCREASED CONTACTS AND THE CALIFORNIA BEGAN GUN VIOLENCE. WELL ALL LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT CURRENTLY ARE GRAPPLING WITH THE CODE IN NINETEEN CRISIS THE EFFORT TO REDUCE TE PUBLIC HEALTH AND PUBLIC SAFETY EMERGENCY OF GUN VIOLENCE REMAINS A TOP PRIORITY WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS LEGISLATION AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP. THANK YOU. ALEXANDER WALKER GRIFFIN. I THINK HE WAS GOING TO DO THE REMOTE TESTIMONY. YEAH OKAY. HOW DO YOU DO MODERATOR HOW DO YOU DO THE- WELL. UP THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR COMMITTEE MEMBERS SO NUMBER GABRIEL FOR THE CHANCE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY SIX SEVENTEEN. I AM PROUD TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL ON BEHALF OF MARK FOR A LOT OF CALIFORNIA. IN CALIFORNIA WE KNOW GUN VIOLENCE PREVENTION RESTRAINING ORDERS ARE AN IMPORTANT TOOL TO HELP PREVENT GUN VIOLENCE ARE COMMITTEES TODAY AT LEAST SIXTEEN STATES HAVE SIMILAR LAWS MINI MALL AFTER OUR BILL. ADOPTED IN TWENTY FOURTEEN. HOWEVER SOMEONE BECOMES PROHIBITED IN ANOTHER STATE AS A RESULT OF THAT STATE'S GB ARLES THEY STILL MAY BE ABLE TO PURCHASE EFFORTS AS FIREARMS IN CALIFORNIA EVEN WITH THAT RESTRICTION IN PLACE. THIS BILL WOULD ADDRESS THAT ISSUE BUT MAKE IT AN OFFENSE TO POSSESS A FIREARM. IN VIOLATION OF A PROTECTIVE ORDER ISSUED BY ANOTHER STATE. BY PROVIDING A FIVE YEAR BAN ON PURCHASING OR POSSESSING FIREARMS OR AMMUNITION IN VIOLATION OF. THAT OUT OF STATE ORDER THIS BILL WOULD SUPPORT THE STEPS THE STATE IS ALREADY TAKEN TO PREVENT GUN VIOLENCE. AND INCREASED PUBLIC SAFETY. THIS BILL CAN BE THE REASON A SPOUSE DOESN'T BECOME A VICTIM OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. OR TEAM LOSE THEIR LIFE IN A SENSELESS SHOOTING WE STRONGLYSUPPORT THIS LEGISLATION. I THINK IT'S ONLY NUMBER DAY BEFORE HIS LEADERSHIP. THANK YOU ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT NAME AN ORGANIZATION. WE HAVE SOMEONE HERE COME UP TO THE MICROPHONE.

YEAH I WANNA THANK THE AUTHOR FOR. CONTACTING ME ABOUT THIS BILL AND I'M FOR TALKING WITH ME ABOUT IT AND I HOPE IN YOUR CLOTHES YOU CAN ADDRESS. SOME OF THE COMMENTS THAT- WERE RAISED BY THE OPPOSITION- AS I MENTIONED TO THE AUTHOR I AM I AM GOING TO GIVE A COURTESY AYE VOTE- TODAY AND COMMITTEE BUT HOPING THAT THE AUTHOR CAN WORK WITH. THE OPPOSITION ON SOME OF THE AMENDMENT SPECIFICALLY THOSE THAT SPEAK TO THE FACT THAT THERE IS A REQUIREMENT TO PROMPTLY ACT THIS INFORMATION INTO THE DOJ DATABASE BUT THERE'S NOT THE SAME CONSIDERATION GIVEN TO TAKING IT OFF WHEN THEY'VE EXPIRED. WE CERTAINLY DON'T WANT TO HAVE DATABASES CHOCK FULL OF FOLKS WHO HAVE REHABILITATED WHO HAVE- SERVED THEIR TIME AND DONE WHAT THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO DO. AND ARE STILL- IN THE SYSTEM IT SAYS MUCH ABOUT ENFORCEMENT AS IT IS ABOUT ACCOUNTABILITY AND JUST RECOGNIZING THAT THERE ARE NUANCES TO OUR OWES ACROSS STATE LINES AND HOPING THAT THAT'S ALSO GIVEN SOME CONSIDERATION. I JUST WANT TO SAY ON THE OUTSIDE THAT WHILE% WE CONTINUE TO ALWAYS HAVE GONE BILLS BECAUSE WE WANT TO PROTECT. VICTIMS WHO ARE SPOUSES AND WHO ARE PARTNERS AND WHO ARE. JUST UNWITTING FOLKS I HOPE THAT WE'RE GIVING THE SAME CONSIDERATION FOR FOLKS WHO ARE JOGGING IN THEIR OWN NEIGHBORHOODS AND DON'T DESERVE TO YOU LOSE THEIR LIVES. AND IF WE CAN COME TO A SPACE WHERE WE'RE LOOKING AT BILLS ARE ALSO PROTECT THOSE KINDS OF FOLKS. I THINK WE WILL MOVE FORWARD AND HAVING A SAFER COMMUNITY FOR ALL OF US THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. YOU MAY CLOSE MISS TO BE RIPPED THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIRMAN TO THE COMMITTEE AND ALSO TO- MY CLICK FROM LOS ANGELES THANK YOU FOR YOUR FOR YOUR VOTING FOR YOUR THOUGHTFUL COMMENTS I'LL JUST TAKE A MOMENT- TO ADDRESS SOME OF YOUR CONCERNS THAT WERE BROUGHT UP BY THE OPPOSITION AND I KNOW OTHERS I'VE HAD CONVERSATIONS WITH. A SPECIFICALLY IN THE DUE PROCESS ISSUE SO- IN RESPONSE TO THE CONCERNS RAISED BY THE CALIFORNIA ATTORNEYS FOR CRIMINAL JUSTICE YOU KNOW THEY HAD TWO MAIN CONCERNS ONE ABOUT- ONE OF THEM HAD TO DO WITH THE DATABASES- JUST I THINK THERE'S A LITTLE BIT CONFUSED ABOUT WHAT THIS BILL DOES THIS BILL DOES NOT ADDRESS THE DATABASE IF YOU AT ALL THAT'S ALREADY CODIFIED IN CURRENT STATUTE. THERE'S A PROVISION THAT WAS ADDED TO THIS BILL THE TO THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL REFERENCED THAT REQUIRES FOR TEMPORARY EMERGENCY RESTRAINING ORDERS THAT THOSE BE FILED WITH THE COURT WITHIN THREE DAYS AND NOT ACTUALLY STRENGTHENED DUE PROCESS PROTECTION FOR- FOR GUN OWNERS IN CALIFORNIA TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS A TIMELY HEARING ON WHETHER OR NOT THERE SHOULD BE A CONTINUING TV ARE OUT SO I THINK THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF CONFUSION THERE. ARE BILL DOESN'T TOUCH THE DATABASE ISSUE IT SOUNDS TO ME FROM THAT LETTER LIKE THERE MIGHT BE SOME- OR THE EFFORTS TO LOOK INTO THAT AND TO TRY TO CLEAN UP THOSE DATABASES BUT THIS BILL DOESN'T DOESN'T TOUCH THAT ISSUE- THE SECOND OBJECTION HAS TO DO WITH CROSS REFERENCING OUT OF STATE PROCEDURES- IT'S A WELL TAKEN POINT- YOU KNOW THERE CERTAINLY ARE DIFFERENCES FROM STATE TO STATE- AND I'M COMMITTED TO IN PARTICULAR WORKING WITH THE ACLU TO ADDRESS SOME OF THEIR CONCERNS ABOUT THAT I'M YOU KNOW I SPENT SIGNIFICANT TIME IS AN ATTORNEY. I PRIOR TO COMING TO THE LEGISLATURE ON CASES UPHOLDING DUE PROCESS RIGHTS I THINK DUE PROCESS PROTECTIONS ARE CENTRAL LOOK FOR TO THOSE CONVERSATIONS- I WILL MENTION AGAIN THIS BILL BUILT ON AB ONE SIXTY FOUR WHICH WAS UNANIMOUS PASSED THE LEGISLATURE THIS I REMEMBER THE COMMITTEE FOR THAT I'LL TWICE AND I DID THIS THING WHICH LOOKED AT YOU KNOW REALLY ENFORCE OUT OF STATE BORDERS IT'S ACTUALLY HARD YOU'LL NOT IN THE- HOUSE UNDER. THE LAW THE VINYL IS WOMEN SO THIS IS OUR SOMETHING THAT ARE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS REQUIRED TO DO UNDER FEDERAL LAWS TO GIVE FULL FAITH AND CREDIT TO THOSE OUT OF STATE I GDR ROSE AND IN SOME WAYS HAVE A DIFFERENT STANDARD HERE WOULD CREATE A PERVERSE INCENTIVE AND WHERE YOU HAVE THE STRONGEST PROTECTIONS. FOR THE MOST DAY. PEOPLE FOR THE FOLKS WHO OF OTHER IN OTHER STATES HAVE. DETERMINED TO BE. AN IMMINENT READ. OF LIKELY HARM TO THEMSELVES OR OTHERS SO. VERY EAGER TO HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS- YOU KNOW WE HAD ASKED. THE OPPOSITION ABOUT WHY THEY WERE NOT IN OPPOSITION TO AB ONE SIX FOUR AND WE'RE OPPOSITION TO THIS WE HAVEN'T HEARD A RESPONSE YET SO I'M- I'M CURIOUS TO HEAR FROM THEM ABOUT. WHY THEY'RE TAKING A DIFFERENT APPROACH TO A BILL THAT. YOU KNOW THE OLD WAS UNANIMOUSLY ENDORSED BY BY THE LEGISLATURE LASTYEAR. GET APPOINTED MAKERS THAT THE CONSTITUTIONAL REQUIREMENTS DON'T CHANGE FROM STATE TO STATE. RIGHT THE DUE PROCESS CLAUSE OF THE FIFTH AND FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT. PRESCRIBE EXACTLY WHAT IS- ALLOWED AND NOT ALLOWED. AND YOU KNOW IF THEIR CONCERNS ABOUT THE ADEQUACY OF PROCESS AND OTHER STATES THEN I THINK THAT THE APPROPRIATE RESPONSE THERE'S FOR THE A SO YOU'RE OTHERS TO BRING SUIT CHALLENGING THOSE PURPOSE. CHALLENGING THE SUFFICIENCY. OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL PROTECTIONS AVAILABLE NO STATE SO- I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF. OF IT YOU KNOW. POINTS HERE TO CONSIDER AND I JUST WANTED TO ADD A LITTLE BIT OF. THAT CONTEXT. THE FINAL THING. I DON'T KNOW IF THE OPPOSITION IN THE BASING THEIR CONCERNS ABOUT TO PROCESS MISS THE PART THAT WE HAVE DIFFERENT TRADITIONAL COUNCIL. BUT THIS BILL ACTUALLY AS I MENTIONED BEFORE STRENGTHENS DUE PROCESS PROTECTIONS FOR GUN OWNERS ARE CALIFORNIA. REQUIRES UNIFORMITY AND CONSISTENCY REQUIRES. THAT YOU THAT IT THAT ATTEMPT EMERGENCY G. VERO BE FILED WITH THE COURT WITHIN THREE DAYS. MAKING SURE THAT THERE IS A HEARING- AND THAT THAT PERSON HAS NOTICE AND AN OPPORTUNITY TO BE HEARD SO I WOULD ARGUE FOR FOLKS ARE WORRIED ABOUT DUE PROCESS- THIS IS THE STRONG VOTING FOR THIS BILL AS A WAY TO ACTUALLY INCREASE DUE PROCESS PROTECTIONS FOR CALIFORNIANS FOR THE RESIDENTS. OF CALIFORNIA FOR THE CONSTITUENTS THAT WE SERVE- SO WITH THAT AGAIN BAD. YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD AGREE THAT THERE ARE SOME SOME THINGS TO THINK ABOUT HERE ANY OPPOSITION- TAKE VERY SERIOUSLY- THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK WITH THEM TO HAVE THOSE DISCUSSIONS. AND YOU KNOW BECAUSE THESE ARE PROCEDURAL ISSUES I THINK THERE ARE THINGS THAT WE CAN PROBABLY ADDRESS PRETTY EASILY LEGISLATIVE LATE. AND I DON'T THINK THERE'S A REASON WE CAN'T DO BOTH HAVE ADEQUATE DUE PROCESS PROTECTIONS. AND ALSO- PROTECT FOLKS FROM FROM FROM GUN VIOLENCE TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE WHO. YOU KNOW WHO ARE POSSESS A- ARE POTENTIALLY REAL REST TO THEMSELVES AND OTHERS. ARE NOT ARE NOT THREATENING THEMSELVES ARE OR FOLKS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO I THINK WE CAN HAVE BOTH. EAGER TO HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS. THANK YOU FOR THE TIME TO EXPLORE. AND RESPECT. DRIVE OUT. THANK YOU AND- IT SOUNDS LIKE NOT ONLY WELL VERSED TO DETER YOU WILLING TO GO THROUGH ALL THE- DEEP DOWN DIE THAT YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS GETS DONE SO THE CHURCH RECOMMEND AND I VOTE. I'M READY TO NERD OUT WITH THEM ON. IT YES YOU ARE. CALL THE ROLL AND AB TWENTY SIX SEVENTEEN GABRIEL THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE JONES SAWYER JOHN SIR HI LACKEY ARE LACKEY AYE BARRICADE HAND. DEEP DEEP I KAMLAGER KAMLAGER I CARILLO CARILLO I THANK SANTIAGO. WICKS DOUBLE GETS OUT FIVE ZERO GRADUATION SHOULD BUILD UP THANK YOU MR TRUMP. NOW MR GIPSON. A. B. TWO SIX FIVE FIVE INVASION OF PRIVACY FIRST RESPONDERS. ARE YOU READY TO BEGIN THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS. THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING US TO PRESENT. TWENTY SIX FIFTY FIVE THANK YOU VERY MUCH SO WE BILL TWENTY SIX FIFTY FIVE WHICH SEEKS TO PROHIBIT FIRST RESPONDERS OR AND ON THE JOB FROM TAKING PERSONAL PHOTOS OF A DECEASED PERSON'S A PERSON'S AFTER JANUARY TWENTY SIX. THE TRAGIC HELICOPTER CRASH THAT KILLED MISTER KOBE BRYANT HIS DAUGHTER GIGI THIRTEEN YEARS OF AGE AND SEVEN OTHERS FIRST RESPONDERS SHARED PHOTOGRAPHS IMAGES OF THAT HORRIFIC. CRASH THE NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION SAFETY BOARD AND THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY CORONER'S OFFICE WERE THE ONLY AGENCIES THAT WERE SUPPOSED TO BE TAKING PHOTOGRAPHS OF A SCENE OF THAT MAGNITUDE. CURRENT LAW GENERALLY SUPPORT A REASONABLE AMOUNT OF PRIVACY FOR DECEASED PERSONS HAVING PHOTOS THAT ARE TAKEN OF THE BY THE CORNER DURING AN AUTOPSY. AND ANYONE WHO VIEWS THE PHOTOS WITH THE INTENT OF INVASION OF PRIVACY OF A DECEASED INDIVIDUALS A PERSON'S PRIVACY- MAY BE FACED WITH A MISDEMEANOR. BUT CURRENT LAW DOES NOT PROHIBIT FIRST RESPONDERS FROM CAPTURING THESE IMAGES OF DECEASED PERSONS OF ANY PURPOSE WITH THE ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY OF CELL PHONES. THE IMAGES OF DECEASED PERSONS CAN BE CAPTURED SET AND RESET HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF TIMES WITH THE JAZZ IN JUST MINUTES OF THE IMAGES BEING CAPTURED THIS ACT IS EXTREMELY AND I ONE UNDERSCORE EXTREMELY SENSITIVE. INSENSITIVE AND CAN NEGATIVELY AFFECT GRIEVING FAMILIES AND LOVED ONES WHO MAY NOT HAVE BEEN. AWARE THAT THEIR LOVED pRESPONDERS ARE TRUSTED TO SECURE AND PRESERVE SCENES OF GREAT DISASTER AND DEATH THE DIGNITY OF THE DECEASED MUST BE PROTECTED AS WELL AS THE PRIVACY OF THEIR LOVE ONES. TAKEN ACCOUNTABILITY AB TWENTY SIX FIFTY FIVE IS A COLLABORATION I WANT TO UNDERSCORE COLLABORATION WITH THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT TO ENSURE THAT THESE OCCURRENCES NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN IN THE FUTURE. AB TWENTY SIX FIFTY FIVE SIX TO MAKE IT A MISDEMEANOR FOR FIRST RESPONDED TO TAKE A PHOTO OF A DECEASED PERSON OR PERSONS FOR ANY PURPOSE. OUTSIDE OF THEIR DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES THIS MISDEMEANORS CARRIES A FIGHT UP TO FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS PERVIOLATIONS UP TO ONE YEAR IN G. COUNTY JAIL OR BOTH. IT IS CRITICAL THAT THOSE WHO ARE TASKED WITH RESPONDING TO THE SCENE OF AN ACCIDENT OR CRIME DO NOT ABUSE DO NOT ABUSE THEIR POSITION FOR PERSONAL PLEASURE. JOINING ME JOIN WITH ME IN SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY SIX IS THE SHERIFF OF LOS ANGELES COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT MISTER ALEX. THANK YOU SORRY THIS ITEM BASS LINE VOTE MISTER MODERATOR COULD YOU PLEASE LET ON OF LOS ANGELES COUNTY SHERIFF ALEX VILLAIN A WAIVER. BY PHONE. GO AHEAD SIR. AND IF I CAN FIND HIS LINE OKAY. ALEX I THINK YOUR LINE IS OPEN JUST GO AHEAD AND ON MUTE YOUR AND SIR. WHATEVER COUNTY NUMBER PROUD SPONSOR TO AB TWENTY SIX FIFTY FIVE. AS PEACE OFFICERS WE ARE EXPECTED BY THOSE WE SERVE TO SHOW PROFESSIONALISM IN ALL OF OUR DAY TO DAY INTERACTIONS WITH THE PUBLIC. THIS PROFESSIONALISM IS MOST IMPORTANT WHEN WE ARE ENTRUSTED WITH THE PERSON MOST PRIVATE INFORMATION DURING TIMES OF TRAGEDY. WE ARE TRYING TO DO ACT DISCREETLY WHEN HANDLING INFORMATION THAT IS NOT MEANT FOR PUBLIC VIEW OR DISSEMINATION. WE ARE IN POWER TO SECURE SCENES OF GREAT DEVASTATION INCLUDING DEATH THEY WERE GIVEN THE AUTHORITY TO LIMIT THE PUBLIC'S ACCESS TO THESE SCENES. TO VIOLATE THE STRUCK BY TAKING PHOTOS FOR NO LAWFUL PURPOSE. IS A TERRIBLE VIOLATION OF PUBLIC TRUST AND CURRENT LAW DOES NOT PROVIDE A REMEDY TO DETER THIS BEHAVIOR. THE OPPOSITION WILL TELL YOU THIS BEHAVIOR CAN BE CONTROLLED BY HAVING A POLICY IN PLACE. IN FACT MOST AGENCIES IF NOT ALL ALREADY HAVE A POLICY IN PLACE THAT ADDRESSES BEHAVIOR TO SOME DEGREE HOWEVER INTERNET STRAIGHT OF POLICY DOES NOT ALLOW A PERSONAL LIKE TRYING TO DIVIDE TO BE SEIZED THE LAWFULLY. UNFORTUNATELY THE THREAT OF A POSITIVE VIOLATION IS NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO DETER THIS FROM HAPPENING AGAIN. IF ENACTED I HIGHLY DOUBT THIS LAW WILL BE USED VERY OFTEN AS THE VAST MAJORITY OF LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS WOULD NOT TAKE A PICTURE IN THE FIRST PLACE. BUT THERE WILL BE THAT MOMENT WHEN THE TEMPTATION MIGHT JUST BE TOO OVERWHELMING FOR THE OFFICER ON THE SCENE. MAKING IT A CRIME I GIVE THAT OFFICER MOMENT OF PAUSE. IN THAT IS WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH WITH THIS BILL IN WILL ALSO PROVIDE US WITH AN ENFORCEMENT TOOL. THANK YOU AND I ASK. FOR YOUR AYE VOTE.

THOUSANDS OF OTHER RANK AND FILE POLICE OFFICERS AND DEPUTY SHERIFFS ON MYSELF IN LOS ANGELES- AND ACROSS THE STATE- IT'S IMPERATIVE WE WORK WE WORK TOGETHER TO MAKE SURE THAT THE BILL IS NARROW THE BILL. IS CLEAR AND SCOPE- AND FOCUSED ON THOSE WHO MALICIOUSLY INTEND TO VIOLATE THE CRIME. THE LAST WE WANT IS FOR SOMEBODY TO MISUNDERSTAND THE RULES- OR HAVE. SOMETHING YOU'LL GET CAUGHT UP IN A SITUATION WHERE THEY BY THIS CRIME UNINTENTIONALLY. CHARGED WITH A MISDEMEANOR FOR IT BOB.

BE SURE OF FOR- THE HEAD OF THE- LONGER AGENCY BUT THEY CAN PRETTY MUCH DO WHAT THEY WANT AS FAR AS PUNISHMENT GOES AND- I THINK IT'S BEST LOOKED AT THAT LEVEL WE DON'T THINK THAT TURNING COPS IN THE CRIMINALS FOR TAKING A PICTURE- IS THE BEST APPROACH ALTHOUGH WE COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND- THE HARM THAT- SUCH PICTURES CAN CAUSE FAMILY OR LOVED ONES WERE- VERY CONCERNED ABOUT- OVERREACH HERE. AND THE PRIVACY OF OFFICERS AND- THEIR PHONES AND THE CONCERN THAT WE HAVE WITH. OFFICERS HAVING THEIR PHONES TAKE IN AND SEARCH BY MANAGEMENT OF BECAUSE THEY THINK THERE THERE MIGHT BE SOMETHING IN THE APPROPRIATE- THOSE- AND- I THINK WE STILL HAVE. A CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO COMPLY TO OFFICERS AND WE THINK THIS BILL IN ITS CURRENT FORM GOES TOO FAR. AND SO. WE MUST- THAT REMAIN- IN A VERY STRONG POSITION CONCERNED AND PROBABLY- IF THE BILL IS NOT AMENDED FURTHER THAN WILL PROBABLY HAVE TO MOVE. TO IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

NO OTHER PARTICIPANTS CUED UP GEN THANK YOU. IT WILL BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE MEMBERS ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS COMMENTS. CONCERNS. YES MISSED CAREER. THANK YOU HAVE A QUESTION TO THE AUTHOR OF LISTENING TO THE TESTIMONY. THIS DOES YOUR DOES YOUR BILL ACTUALLY ALLOW. POTENTIALLY MANAGEMENT TO REVIEW AND OFFICERS PERSONAL PHONE NO CONTEXT NO IT HAS TO BE UNDER THIS UNDER THIS- THE WORDING OF THIS VIDEO YOU HAVE TO ACTUALLY TO WARRANT FROM A JUDGE AND THERE HAS TO BE REASONABLE SUSPICION IN FACT THAT SOMEONE HAS DONE SOMETHING LIKE THIS TO RISE THAT PARTICULAR LEVEL SO YOU HAVE TO PROVE TO A JUDGE THAT A PERSON. WHO'S A FIRST RESPONDER LAW ENFORCEMENT OR WHATEVER- HAS RISEN TO A CERTAIN LEVEL THAT THAT PERSON HAS PHOTOGRAPHS- ON THEIR PHONE IN ORDER FOR THE PHONE TO BE ACTUALLY SEIZED AND EVEN THEN IT'S NEARLY AS WHERE THEY FIND SOMETHING ELSE THAT IS NOT GERMANE TO THE WARRANT THEY CAN'T USE IT. THEY ONLY GO THERE FOR THIS REASON. SO OKAY SO I WOULD IMAGINE THAT THAT HAS TO GO THROUGH THE PROCESS OF THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES INTERNAL- INVESTIGATIONS WITH THEIR OWN INTERNAL UNITS IN ORDER FURTHER FOR IT TO GET TO THAT LEVEL THAT'S CORRECT OKAY- I JUST I ONE ALSO JUST SAY THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BILL I KNOW THAT IT'S- A BIT CONTROVERSIAL WITHIN LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES THEMSELVES AND- THANK MY SHARE OF THE END OF. GUARDING THE OFFICER WHO TOOK THE PHOTOS WHO WAS AT A BAR SHOWING OF TO A DATE- THE PHOTOS OF THE KOBE BRYANT HELICOPTER CRASH- WHICH IS AN UNFORTUNATE I THINK FIND A PRIVILEGE FOR THAT OFFICER- THAT AND I WAS A BARTENDE WHO OVERSAW IT FOR HER THE CONVERSATION AND REPORTED IT- AND SO I JUST I THINK THE ENTIRE INCIDENT- IS VERY UNFORTUNATE AND- LOOKS POORLY. IN THE SITUATION SO I HOPE THAT YOU DO COME TO A RESOLUTION WAS- THOSE ARE IN OPPOSITION BECAUSE WE WANT I THINK ALL OF US WOULD WANT TO FEEL SOME KIND OF SAFETY AND SECURITY AND PRIVACY. BOTH FOR CIVILIANS BUT ALSO FOR THE OFFICERS WHO RESTORE LIVES EVERY DAY AND WHO TRY TO DO THE GOOD WORK THAT THEY DO.

OFFER OUR ONE A THANK THE AUTHOR JUST. AND THE- ALL OF THEM THEIR LEADER ON THIS ISSUE. OBVIOUS THERE IS NO EXCUSE FOR THE WELL NO OF THIS BILL. BUT I DO WANT TO MAKE SOMETHING VERY CLEAR- I'VE HAD DISCUSSIONS DOLLAR WOULD ALTER BUT WITH EVERYONE. INVOLVED THE SHERIFF A LEAD TO ELLIE PPL OTHER AGENCIES. AND I CAN TELL YOU. IN ALL OF THOSE DISCUSSIONS BOTH SIDES AGREE THAT THIS WAS WRONG THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO ONE ANYBODY IN MY EAR SHOT NO ONE ON EITHER SIDE WHERE THEY HAVE CONCERNS ARE NOT. BELIEVES THAT THIS BUT THIS PERSON DID WAS APPROPRIATE. AT EACH SIDE WANTED TO STOP FOREVER SELECT THIS JUST MAKE THAT VERY CLEAR BOTH LAW ENFORCEMENT. AND THE PUBLIC WANTED TO STOP. MY INTEREST IN SEEING THIS BILL MOVE FORWARD- IS REALLY TO STOP THIS ABUSE OF PRIVACY. AND IS REALLY UNPROFESSIONAL CONDUCT FROM FROM EVER EVER HAPPENING AGAIN. AS A MEMBER OF LABOR I ALSO KNOW. EIGHT YEARS FIGHT BETWEEN MANAGEMENT AND EMPLOYEES AND I'VE I'VE HEARD THERE'S BEEN SOME VERY STRENUOUS. REALLY HARD FOUGHT DISCUSSIONS ON THIS AND THAT WHICH DOES PROBABLY MORE UP WHAT MANAGEMENT WANTS AND WHAT. NOW WHAT THE EMPLOYEES WANT- UGH AT THE END OF THE DAY OF. AS YOU KNOW MISTER GIBSON AND PROBABLY EVERYBODY ELSE KNOWS THIS IS A COMMITTEE THAT DOESN'T WANT TO NOT ONLY OVER INCARCERATE. BUT GIVE PENALTIES OUT THERE LOOK TOO STRENUOUS AND WITH THAT IN MIND WHEN THE EARLY DISCUSSIONS. ABOUT DOING FELONIES CAME TO THIS COMMITTEE OR AT LEAST CAME TO MY YOUR SHOT THAT WAS REALLY A NO STARTER. IS NOT ENOUGH BUT WHEN IT DOES YOU KNOW STARTED BECAUSE IT WAS SOMEONE AT WAR BRANCH WHERE YOU'RE- SWORN FOR NON SWORN WE WANT TO MAKE SURE. WEEK WHATEVER THE CRIME IS OR WHETHER THE INFRACTION IS THAT IS WHATEVER WE DO IS PENALTIES IT IS APPROPRIATE. AND THAT IS NOT TOO HARSH. BUT IT'S ENOUGH TO STOP THE ACTIVITY. AND SO THAT'S WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW AND I WANT TO COMMEND THE AUTHOR- AND EVEN TO SPONSOR FOR REALLY TRYING TO WORK. WITH THE LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY TO COME UP WITH SOMETHING COULD THIS IS IN SOME WAYS. IS ABOUT WE TALK ABOUT REHABILITATION. DOES WHAT WE TALK ABOUT EVERY DAY IN THIS COMMITTEE ABOUT. HOW DO WE TRAIN INDIVIDUALS SO THAT THEY NEVER DO THAT ACT AGAIN. AGAIN TODAY AND I WOULD I WANT TO APPLAUD THE AUTHOR FOR WORKING WITH THE OPPOSITION IS SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THEM. ADD TO INCLUDE TRAINING AND OTHER MEASURES THAT WILL HELP STOP THIS BEHAVIOR. IN THE FUTURE. I ALSO WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE. THAT AS WE MOVE FOR NEXT YEAR. WE ALSO WANT TO LOOK AT THE VICTIMS AND I WOULD BUT I PLAN TO WORK WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER JACQUI IRWIN ON AB TWENTY THREE SEVENTY TWO TO LOOK AT THE IMPACT OF VICTIMS HAVE WITH. THIS TYPE OF ACTIVITY AND WHAT CAN BE SHOWN AND SO THIS DISCUSSION WILL WOULD NOT HOPEFULLY THIS ONE WITH A LOT FOR THE LONG WE CAN GET SOMETHING DONE HERE AND THEN WE CAN DO A MUCH BROADER LOOK AT HOW. VICTIMS PEOPLE WHOSE PICTURES ARE BEING SHOWN HOW WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT IMPACT IS MITIGATED AS MUCH AS WE CAN. OF WHAT I'M NOT INTERESTED IN SEEING IS A CONTINUATION AGAIN OF THE OVERLY HARSH PUNITIVE PURELY PUNITIVE LOCK THEM UP AND THROW AWAY THE KEY APPROACH THAT WE WORK SO HARD TO AND DO IN THIS COMMITTEE. I CAN TO SUPPORT THIS BILL TODAY. AND A CURSE YOU OFFER TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH THE OPPOSITION ON A SOLUTION- I'M GONNA HOLD OFF FOR ONE THREE THIS BILL TODAY BUT I LOOK FORWARD TO SIGNING ON ONCE.

THANK THE AUTHOR FOR- YOUR CONTINUED PASSION ON THIS ISSUE AND I BELIEVE THAT AT SOME POINT. WE WILL FIND SOME COMMON GROUND- I WANT TO SAY THAT I AM UNABLE TO SUPPORT THIS BILL AT THIS TIME IN ITS CURRENT FORM. I WOULD TOTALLY BE ABLE TO SUPPORT A BILL THAT DEALS SOLELY WITH THE MENTAL HEALTH ASPECTS OF THIS BUT I HAVE SOME GRAVE CONCERNS ABOUT SORT OF. EXPANDING THE ALREADY BLOATED AUTHORITY OF DA'S OFFICES- AND PROSECUTORS AND WOULD WISH THAT. THERE COULD BE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR. MAYBE MORE COLLABORATIVE APPROACHES TO TRYING TO SEEK GDR ROSE THAT WOULD INCLUDE NOT JUST D. A.'S- OR CA'S BUT ALSO YOU KNOW. THE IMPACT OF COMMUNITIES. PUBLIC DEFENDERS AND OR- DEFENSE COUNSEL.

I'M KIND OF RELATE AN UNDERSTANDING THAT'S REALLY REQUIRED THAT I THINK IS REALLY REQUIRED WHEN YOU'RE MOVING INTO- THE DIRECTION OF THIS KIND OF- THIS EFFORT. AND SO MAYBE THERE'S A WAY TO THINK ABOUT THAT AND- SOMETHING THAT'S MORE RESTORE IN COLLABORATIVE- AND WOULD CERTAINLY BE SUPPORTIVE OF SOMETHING LIKE THAT- AND I WANT TO MAINTAIN THAT I DO SUPPORT THE ASPECT OF THIS THAT DEAL WITH THE MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES AND I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING MICHAEL MOORE SET.

WE'RE GONNA STAND RECESS TILL TWO O'CLOCK. THE BACK IN ORDER WAIT FOR COM LAW THE DOVE. INTERESTED COMMITTEE TO COME HERE SO WE CAN BEGIN. AB NINETEEN FIFTY PROBATION LENGTH OF TERMS NUMBER SIXTEEN KAMLAGER DOVE. THE REST OF THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS. YEAH. YEAH. HI. ALL. WE HAVE A QUORUM IS COLORED UP WOULD YOU LIKE TO MAKE YOUR VISITATION AB NINETEEN FIFTY. HAVE YOU. YES WE DID WE DID. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE IS EVERYTHING ALRIGHT. OKAY EVER AGAIN MY BAD. MY BAD I AM HERE TO PRESENTS. AB NINETEEN FIFTY WHICH SETS A MAXIMUM PROBATION PERIOD OF ONE YEAR FOR MISDEMEANOR OFFENSES AND TWO YEARS FOR A FELONY OFFENSES IN EIGHTEEN FORTY ONE. JOHN I GUESS THIS CONCEIVED OF A NATION OF PROBATION AS AN INFORMAL INDIVIDUALIZED SYSTEM THAT WAS HEAVILY FOCUSED ON REHABILITATION. THAT VISION HAS METASTASIZED INTO A HUMAN WAREHOUSING SYSTEM. AND STRUCTURE THAT ATTEMPTS TO A LIST OF COMPLIANCE FROM INDIVIDUALS PRIMARILY THROUGH THE IMPOSITION OF FINES FINES FEES AND CONDITIONS THAT OFTEN CANNOT BE MATT. THIS WEB IN WHICH PROBATIONERS FIND THEMSELVES IS UNDER FUNDED AND FINANCIAL BURDENS LEVIED ON TOP OF NUMEROUS CONDITIONS OVER AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME HAVE BECOME A RECIPE FOR DISASTER. DEFAULTING PROBATION OFFICERS INTO ADMINISTRATIVE COLLECTION AGENTS RATHERTHAN ENGAGE REHABILITATIVE EXTENSIONS OF COURTS AND COUNTIES. PROBATION IS THE MOST TO LEE USE FORM OF CORRECTIONAL CONTROL IN THIS STATE CALIFORNIA'S ADULT SUPERVISION POPULATION IS ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND IT IS ONE OF THE LARGEST OF ANY STATE IN THE NATION MORE THAN TWICE THE SIZE OF OUR PRISON POPULATION ALMOST FOUR TIMES LARGER THAN OUR JAIL POPULAR. AND SIX ONE. OUR POPULATION. IT IS ALSO THE BIGGEST. IN PRISON. FOR PROBATIONERS THIS PERIOD OF SUPERVISION COMES WITH STRICT MANDATES. A SENTENCE OF PROBATION REQUIRES THE PERSON UNDER SUPERVISION TO REPORT ON A REGULAR SCHEDULE AND IT HERE TO A NUMBER OF CONDITIONS LIKE BEING DRUG FREE. I'M AT A CERTAIN TIME ATTENDING SESSIONS NOT IN THE FRONT SEAT OF A VEHICLE OR EVEN GETTING PREGNANT. THE AVERAGE NUMBER OF CONDITIONS IS ABOUT FIFTY OR A PROBATIONER INVITE IT YEAH CONDITIONS ALONG WITH THE LAW OR ORDER AND SO. RESULT IN ORDER. CONDITIONS THERE ARE THE GREATER THE LIKELIHOOD IS THAT SOME WILL BE VIOLATED AND THEN THERE ARE THE FINES AND FEES ASSOCIATED WITH BEING A PROBATION. THE FEES FOR SOMEONE ON PROBATION IS MORE THAN THIRTY SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS PROBATIONERS ARE REQUIRED TO PAY FOR COURT. AND PROBATION SUPERVISION COSTS BOOKING LAB AND URINALYSIS FEES ANGER MANAGEMENT CLASSES X. AT AROUND. CONSIDER THAT PEOPLE ON PROBATION WILL LIKELY EARN A LOW INCOME OR BE UNEMPLOYED BECAUSE THEY ARE ON VACATION. AND THAT FAILURE TO FATE PAY THESE FINES AND FEES WHILE ON PROBATION ULTIMATELY RESULT IN A VIOLATION. SO FATIGUE AND FAILURE BECOME A PART OF THIS WEB AND AS A RESULT A LARGE PORTION OF PEOPLE ON PROBATION VIOLATE THEIR TERM REQUIREMENTS AND END UP INCARCERATED. 20% OF PRISON ADMISSIONS IN CALIFORNIA ARE THE RESULT OF SUPERVISED PROBATION VIOLATIONS ACCOUNTING FOR PART OF THE ESTIMATED TWO BILLION WITH A B. DOLLARS SPENT ANNUALLY BY THE STATE CAR THREE PEOPLE FOR THE SUPERVISION VIOLATIONS. IN TWENTY EIGHT IN A PERCENT OF PEOPLE INCARCERATED IN CALIFORNIA PRISON WERE BEHIND BARS FOR SUPERVISED PROBATION VIOLATIONS MOST OF WHICH WERE TECHNICAL IN OF SUPERVISING SOMEONE ON PROBATION IS TWELVE DOLLARS. OR ABOUT FORTY FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS A YEAR. CALIFORNIA PROBATION DEPARTMENT SUPERVISES THE LARGEST POPULATION YET THEY RECEIVE THE LEAST AMOUNT OF FUNDING COMPARED TO OTHER SUPERVISION DEPARTMENTS HANSOL THE FINES AND FEES WHICH BECOME ON COLLECTIBLE. THIS IS A BAD BUSINESS MODEL FOR ALL OF US STATES COUNTIES PROBATIONERS AND TAXPAYERS. WE NEED A PROBATION SYSTEM FOR THE COST OF THE PROGRAMS DO NOT EXCEED THE ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES WHICH CAN HAPPEN WHEN YOU HAVE FEWER PEOPLE ON PROBATION. PROBATION OFFICERS WITH LIGHTER CASE LOADS ARE BETTER ABLE TO DO THEIR JOB SMALL CASE FRONT. WITH THE SERVER. SIGN FOR SIX OTHER FOR FAIR IS WHERE WE SHOULD BE HEADED ESPECIALLY NOW. THERE WOULD BE FEWER PROBATIONERS TO CLOG UP THE COURTS. THE TIME OF PROSECUTORS AND PUBLIC DEFENDERS AND MORE TIME AND RESOURCES COULD BE SPENT ON HIGH RISK HIGH NEED PROBATIONERS. THE OPPONENTS SAY THAT THIS IS ONE SIZE FITS ALL BUT THE CURRENT MODEL IS ONE SIZE FITS ALL. THREE FIVE EIGHT YEAR TERMS VIOLATIONS THAT LAND YOU IN JAIL OR PRISON ARE BACK TO SQUARE ONE WHERE YOU HAVE TO START THE CLOCK ALL OVER AGAIN. WITH NO REAL INCENTIVE TO SUCCEED. IS ONE SIZE FITS ALL. AB NINETEEN FIFTY DOES REDUCE TIME ON PROBATION BASED ON THE GOVERNOR'S JANUARY OPPOSE ALL STUDIES AND MODELS PRACTICE IN THIS STATE SUCH AS CONTRA COSTA COUNTY US CANNOT A STUDY OF THIS COUNTIES PRACTICES REVEAL THAT JUDGES ISSUED A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF SENTENCES IN THE TWENTY FOUR MONTH RANGE OR LOWER. PROBATIONERS WAS SHORTER TERMS HAVE LOWER RECIDIVISM RATES THE COUNTY RELIED HEAVILY AMONG OTHER THINGS ON RISK ASSESSMENT TOOLS AND CONTRACTED SERVICES TO THE LEVER NEEDED TREATMENT TO THOSE IN GREATEST NEED. RESEARCH SHOWS THAT PROBATION SERVICE SUCH AS MENTAL HEALTH CARE AN ADDICTION TREATMENT ARE MOST EFFECTIVE DURING THE FIRST EIGHTEEN MONTHS OF SUPERVISION. RESEARCH ALSO INDICATES THAT PROVIDING INCREASED SUPERVISION AND SERVICES EARLIER REDUCES AN INDIVIDUAL'S LIKELIHOOD TO RESERVE EIGHT. AND I MIGHT ADD THAT IN TWO YEARS YOU CAN DO A LOT YOU CAN BECOME AN AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLER YOU CAN COULD BECOME AN AVIONICS TECHNICIAN YOU CAN BECOME A NUCLEAR MEDICAL TECHNICIAN ALL OF THOSE CAN HAPPEN IN TWO YEARS. I THINK I AGREE THAT YOU WANT PEOPLE OFFER PROBATION AND YOU DON'T WANT THEM TO GET BACK ON. BUT LAST TIME DOESN'T MEAN LESS MEANINGFUL OR LESS MEMORABLE OR EVEN EASY. AB NINETEEN FIFTY IS NOT A ONE SIZE FITS ALL. DEPARTMENTS WITH DESIGN PROGRAMS WITH MORE EFFECTIVE TERMS OF SUPERVISION AN INDIVIDUALIZED TREATMENT SERVICES. CORD STILL AND WOULD CONTINUE TO GET PROGRESS REPORTS ON PROBATIONERS JUDGES WOULD ALSO STILL HAVE THE LATITUDE TO REVOKE PROBATION IF A PROBATIONER IS GROSSLY OUT OF COMPLIANCE RESTITUTION WOODS WE DO. ALL ADDS IS THE CASE TODAY. CALVET NINETEEN IS FORCED US TO ACCEPT THE NEW NORMAL IN REGARD TO OUR JOBS SOCIAL LIVES AND MORE. I CHALLENGED US TO ENVISION A NEW NORMAL WHERE JUSTICE IS BASED ON RESEARCH FACTS AND FIGURES. AND WHAT IS ARE DESIGNED FOR A FIFTH. AND SUCCESS. A NEW NORMAL WHERE SUPERVISION IS NOT ABOUT HOW LONG SOMEONE'S TERM IS BUT HOW MEANINGFUL THE TERM IS. THE CHIEF PROBATION OFFICERS OF CALIFORNIA AGREED WITH THIS IN FACT IN JANUARY WHEN THEY ISSUED A PRESS RELEASE IN SUPPORT OF THE GOVERNOR'S NOW WITHDRAWN PROBATION REFORM TRAILER BILL. SAYING INVESTING IN EVIDENCE BASED PRACTICES ON THE FRONT TEN AND ALIGNING SUPERVISION AND SERVICES WITH A PERSON'S RISK AND NEEDS RATHER THAN SIMPLY THEIR OFFENSE. WILL IMPROVE PUBLIC SAFETY AND GIVE PEOPLE A BETTER CHANCE OF STAYING CRIME FREE FOR THE LONG TERM. THIS GROUP NOW OPPOSES THIS BILL ALTHOUGH WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH THE OPPOSITION ON A NUMBER OF SENSIBLE AMENDMENTS THAT WILL ADDRESS SOME OF THEIR CONCERNS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE ON AB. NINETEEN FIFTY TO HELP MOVE US ALONG IN THOSE NEGOTIATIONS WHICH IN FACT WERE JUST HAPPENING A MINUTE AGO. HERE WITH ME IN SUPPORT IS MAN WHO RUNS YOU OF THE SAN FRANCISCO PUBLIC DEFENDER'S OFFICE. AS WELL AS DAVID MUHAMMAD OF THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM. THANK. YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS THANK. YOU THANK YOU. AND I'LL SECOND IT. WE CAN NOW HAVE WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. FROM SAN FRANCISCO TO DEFENDER AND TO FOR CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM. MISTER MODERATOR CAN YOU PASS THE MEN. THANK YOU THOSE LINES ARE OPEN. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR NUMBERS MY NAME IS BELOW ROGER. AND I BE ELECTED PUBLIC DEFENDER SEPARATE. I'M USED TO BE SPEAKING TO YOU TODAY IN STRONG SUPPORT OF AB NIKE FIFTY BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER. KAMLAGER AB NINETEEN FIFTY RECOGNIZE THAT WHEN IT COMES TO PROBATION SUPERVISION LESS REALLY CAN BE MORE IT IS MORE. BUT DEFENDERS WE FREQUENTLY THE FORMER CLIENT OF OURS. WE APART LONG AND HARD ALONG SIDE GERM FRIEDMAN HI GO BACK INTO THAT THAT THE SIMPLY DUE TO THE TECHNICAL POPULATION. PROBATION CAN. THE TECHNICAL. INCLUDE ANYTHING FROM THAT TO GET. BLOCKED UP TO MORE THAN ONE FIGHT TOLD ME THEY TRIED TO REACH A PROBATION OFFICER WITH VOICE MAIL WAS FULL. TO UNPAID CARTONS. OKAY THE IT'S KIND OF NET WHAT THE END UP MAKING SOMETHING THAT IN THEORY IS SUPPOSED TO BE ALL ACTUALLY CARPAL. ROCKETS YEAH I BRING NUMBERS ILLUSTRATE A TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN JET THE CENTER OF THE COUNCIL OF STATE GOVERNMENTS STUDY OF 67% 67% JAIL AND PRISON ADMISSIONS IN CALIFORNIA IN TWO THOUSAND AND SEVENTEEN WE'RE DUE TO TECHNICAL VIOLATION. PAROLE AND PROBATION VIOLATION END UP COSTING THE STATE APPROXIMATELY TWO BILLION ANNUAL. THIS IS A HUGE CONTRIBUTOR YOUR TO THE VERY QUOTE JAIL CHURN UNQUOTE PROBLEM THAT IT BECOME A MUCH MORE WELL KNOWN ISSUE SIR DUE TO THE CORONAVIRUS. THE NEED FOR REDUCING NET WIDENING JAIL CHURN HAS BECOME EVEN MORE CUTE DURING THE END OF IT. ANY UNNECESSARY PRODUCT THAT THE PEOPLE. OPEN PRESENTS INCREASES THE LIKELIHOOD OF THE SPREAD OF THE VIRUS AMONGST LAW ENFORCEMENT. BACK TO THE COMMUNITY A LOT. IT'S A GREAT TIME IN JAIL AND PRISON EVEN MORE DANGEROUS AND FOR MANY THAT LOOK. IT INCLUDES THE FIRST PERSON CODED NINETEEN RYKER'S ISLAND. NEW YORK CITY JAIL. HIS NAME WAS MICHAEL TYPE HE WAS FIFTY THREE YEARS OLD AND WITHIN JAILBREAK TECHNICAL VIOLATION CALL FAILING TO SHOW UP FOR PAROLE ME. PROBATION ALSO OFFICE THEN THE WAY PEOPLE LOOK FOR WITH THEIR LIVES. IN ORDER TO QUALIFY RECORD EXPUNGED MUST'VE SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED PROBATION. SO MAKING A PROBATION CAN PREVENT SOMEONE FROM BE BEING ABLE TO CLEAR THEIR CRIMINAL RECORD WHICH IN TURN BLOCKED THEM OUT OF JOBS AND HELPING IMPACTING THEM AND CRITICALLY CRITICALLY THEIR FAMILIES THAT'S LEADING TO GENERAL SMALL IMPACTS ON OTHERS. A CHILL OF THE ONE ON PROBATION. FURTHER BEING DENIED EMPLOYMENT OR STABLE HOUSING ARE INDICATORS LIKELY TO LEAD FOLKS BACK INTO AN INTEGUMENT BUT THE CRIMINAL LEGAL SYSTEM. AND FREQUENTLY RESULT IN HOMELESSNESS. LONGER PROBATION PERIOD I'M JUST NOT GOOD PUBLIC POLICY IF THE EVIDENCE SHOWED MALL MALL WAS. DIFFERENT STORY BUT- IT SHOWS THE OPPOSITE ELECTED SO THERE'S NO MORE FEELING MORE SATISFYING TO PUBLIC DEFENDER THAT TO SEE SOMEONE GO THROUGH A COMPLETE PROBATION SUCCESSFULLY AND THEN GET A CLEAN PLATE CERTIFICATE AND GET THE JOB WE WANT THAT SOONER RATHER THAN LATER. GOOD FOR PUBLIC SAFETY. FOR THE INDIVIDUAL AND GENERATION FALL WHICH REALLY ALL THE EVIDENCE NOT DOING SO AS COSTLY BOTH IN DOLLARSAND ENJOY THAT FOR ALL THESE REASONS. CHARLIE URGE YOUR I BOUGHT THE NINETEEN FIFTY THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME. THE. DAVID MUHAMMAD. ROUND IF YOU DON'T FIND THAT YOUR LINE IS OPEN PLEASE PRESS STAR AND THEN ZERO. ONE MOMENT PLEASE. HELLO YES GO AHEAD OKAY THANK YOU A GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR JONES SAWYER AND THE MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE MY NAME IS DAVID MUHAMMAD AND I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM I'M ALSO THE PROPERTY PROBATION OFFICER IN ALAMEDA COUNTY FORMER DEPUTY COMMISSIONER PROBATION IN NEW YORK CITY. THE DAY AND DEBATE TEAM FIFTY. BRING MUCH NEEDED RELIEF TO PROBATION OFFICERS HANDED ALIGNED WITH EVIDENCE BASED PRACTICES. PROBATION IS BY FAR THE LARGEST PORTION OF THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM IN THE COUNTRY WHICH IS ALSO TRUE IN CALIFORNIA. ACCORDING TO THE MOST RECENT DATA THERE ARE THREE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND ADULTS UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF COUNTY PROBATION DEPARTMENTS THROUGHOUT THE CALIFORNIA. FROM WHAT WE CAN GLEAN THERE ABOUT TWO TO THREE TIMES THAT AMOUNT ON MISDEMEANOR PROBATION KNOWN AS CORPORATION. BUT ALL THAT DATA IS NOT AVAILABLE. FOR ADULTS THE SUPERVISION COUNTY PROBATION APARTMENTS HAVE THE LET THE PROBATION VARIES FROM COUNTY TO COUNTY MOST OF THREE YEARS BUT SEVERAL COUNTIES AS LONG AS FIVE. FOR MISDEMEANOR PROBATION THE TERMS ARE USUALLY THREE YEARS BUT THERE IS NO ACTIVE SUPERVISION. AB NINETEEN FIFTY PROPOSES A MUCH MORE EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT WAY TO OPERATE PROBATION. AB NINETEEN FIFTY PROVIDE SUPPORT TO FRONTLINE WORKERS AND SEVERAL LARGE TO MID SIZED COUNTIES PROBATION OFFICERS HAVE CASELOADS UPWARDS OF ONE HUNDRED AND SOME OF. IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO QUALITY WORK WITH SIXTY PEOPLE LET ALONE ONE HUNDRED. ABNINETEEN FIFTY MAKES THE SAME LIMITS ON PROBATION AS THE GOVERNOR PROPOSED IN HIS BUDGET THIS JANUARY. I AGREE WITH MY FORMER COLLEAGUES OF THE CHIP PROBATION OFFICERS OF CALIFORNIA. THAT PROPOSAL AND SAID THAT IT REFLECTED QUOTE RESEARCH DEMONSTRATES WORKING WITH INDIVIDUALS USING APPROPRIATE SERVICES AND SUPPORTS WITHIN THE FOUR. YEARS OF THE PROBATION TERM IS THE- PAINS TO HATE. DO A HAND ON. IN THE MAY READ THE GUY HAS BEEN A COUPLE ROLE TERMS TO TWO YEARS FOR MOST PAROLEESIN ADDITION TO PROVIDING EARNED EARLY DISCHARGE GIVING THEM SHORTER TERMS ON PAROLE. FOR POPULATION IN GENERAL AT HIGHER RISK THAN PEOPLE ON PROBATION. IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THE HARVARD KENNEDY SCHOOL'S EXECUTIVE SESSION ON COMMUNITY CORRECTIONS WHICH INCLUDED SEVERAL CHIEF PROBATION OFFICERS RECOMMENDED REDUCING SUPERVISION TERMS TO BETWEEN ONE AND TWO YEARS WITH ADDITIONAL OPPORTUNITY TO TERM TIME TO EARN TIME OFF OF PROBATION. IN APRIL ARNOLD ON VACATION AND PEW CHARITABLE TRUSTS RELEASED A POLICY FRAMEWORK WITH OVER FIFTY RECOMMENDATIONS TO IMPROVE COMMUNITY SUPERVISION. WHICH INCLUDES REDUCING THE SIZE OF PROBATION AND FOCUSING SUPERVISION ON THE INITIAL PERIOD WHEN MOST THE ARRESTS OCCUR. A PREVIOUS STUDY BY PEW REVEALED THAT AFTER EIGHTEEN MONTHS OF SUPERVISION THE LIKELIHOOD THAT SOMEOE MORE SEDATE SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCES AND THEREFORE SUPERVISION SHOULD BE FRONT LOADED TO THE FIRST TWELVE TO EIGHTEEN MONTHS AND FOCUSED ON THOSE ASSESSED AT HIGHER RISK. AB NINETEEN FIFTY WOMEN'S BEST PRACTICES AND REPRESENTED A WIN WIN. IT REDUCES THE IT'S LOADS OF OVERWORKED PROBATION OFFICERS FOCUSES ATTENTION FOR THE RIGHT TIME OF SUPERVISION AND A FAIRER TO THE PEOPLE ON SUPERVISION FOR THESE REASONS I THANK YOU AND URGE A ES VOTE ON A.

LIMITING PROBATION TO TWO YEARS IN ALL CRIMINAL CASES IS A NECESSARY COURT ALREADY HAVE THE POWER TO CHOOSE AN INITIAL READ OF PROBATION THAT IS APPROPRIATE FOR A PARTICULAR CASE AND- TO TERMINATE THAT. FOR PROBATION COMPLETES ALL TERMS AND CONDITIONS BILL CODE SECTION TWELVE OH TWO POINT SEVEN SAYS THE SAFETY OF THE PUBLIC SHALL BE A PRIMARY GOAL THROUGH THE ENFORCEMENT OF COURT ORDERED CONDITIONS OF PROBATION. THIS BILL WOULD STRIP AWAY FROM JUDGE. THOSE MOST FAMILIAR WITH THE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES OF A GIVEN CASE THE POWER TO DECIDE THE APPROPRIATE LIKE THE PROBATION BASED ON THE MOST RELEVANT FACTORS. THIS IS A DEFENSE YOUR VENDOR. THREE WHO SHOULD THE OFFENDER OF THE CRIME VICTIM AND THE TYPE OF WE HAVE. PRO THE COURT ORDER THIS BILL WOULD STEM. REPLACE THE COURT INFO DISK IN.

WHAT ABOUT HOUSE BOUND ELDERLY VICTIMS OF FINANCIAL CRIMES FOR EXAMPLE WHO LOST THEIR LIFE SAVINGS AS A RESULT OF THE CRIMINAL ACTS OF AN OFFENDER. WHAT DOES THIS BILL TELL THEM REGARDING THE RESTITUTION SORRY TWO YEARS ARE UP AND THIS BILL WILL COURT NO LONGER HAS ANY JURISDICTION TO HELP YOU RECOVER WHAT WAS STOLEN FROM YOU. YOU CAN OF COURSE. BUT IS DO THROUGH CIVIL JUDGMENT PROCESS. OR CONSIDER A PERSON WHO HAS RACKED UP FOR DO YOU AYE CONVICTIONS IN LESS THAN TEN YEARS. AND IS SENTENCED FOR ABOUT. UNDER EXISTING LAW A JOB. LIAM POSES FIVE YEARS FELONY PROBATION. AS THE TERM AND CONDITION OF THAT PROBATION THE DEFENDANT IS TO INSTALL AND MAINTAIN AN INTERLOCKING MISSION DEVICE WHICH PRESENT PREVENTS HIM FROM STARTING IS CAR WITHOUT FIRST READING INTO THE DEVICE- THE HAS THE ALCOHOL IN HIS SYSTEM. HIS BROTHER ORDER NO MEASURABLE AMOUNT OF ALCOHOL THIS IS THE MALL DRIVE. UNDER THIS BILL. AFTER JUST TWO YEARS. DESPITE OF THE HISTORY OF DRIVING WHILE INTOXICATED HE WOULD. BE TO CONNECT. THE VICE AND DRY WITHOUT THE WHOLE IT IS SYSTEM WITHOUT CONSEQUENCE. HOW DOES THAT. I WOULD. THOSE WELL GO TO. THAT THIS OF THE PUBLIC BE THE- GOAL. WE ALSO WERE TAKE ISSUE WITH THE INFO SO IN THE- THAT SAYS 8% OF CALIFORNIA'S PRISON POPULATION IS INCARCERATED FOR VIOLATING COMPARATIVELY MINOR PROBATION- CONDITIONS IS MISSING DRUG APPOINTMENT OR SOCIAL SOCIALIZING WITH A FRIEND WHO HAS A CRIMINAL RECORD. WITH ALL DUE RESPECT DON'T BELIEVE THERE ARE RATHER CREDIBLE. DOUBLE THE NOT. ABOUT MEMBERS ON PROBATION BEING SPENT INSTANCE PRISON WHEN A DRUG TREATMENT APPOINTMENT WAS WITH THE- THERE MAY BE CASES LIKE THE EXAM I SAW IN THE A PERSON ON FELLOW PROBATION FOR THE WHY IS THAT TO PRISON BY A JUDGE OF REMOVING AN- ICE. ABOUT THIS. ONLY 3% OF STATE POPULAR IS IN CARS FOR FILE OF PROBATION AND WITH RESPECT TO SEE EVIDENCE THAT QUITE VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ASSAULTS AND I CRIMES AND THE PUBLIC AT LARGE THE LAW ON THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF PROBATION PUT. HARPER IN TERMS OF YOURS. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CRIME THAT WAS COULD AND THE PERSON WHO COMMITS IT BREAKS OF OUR RESPONSE TO FIND VICTIMS IN CALIFORNIA AND WE RESPECTFULLY APPS WILL MOBILE. LIKE THANK YOU MISTER MORRIS. DANIELLE SANCHEZ JUST PROBATION OFFICERS. GOOD AFTERNOON AND THANK YOU I CHAIR NUMBERS DANIEL SANCHEZ ON BEHALF OF THE CHIEF PROBATION OFFICERS A CALIFORNIA I RESPECTFULLY IN OPPOSITION TO DETECT THE NINETEEN AT THE END OF CURRENTLY WRITTEN I DO WANT TO EXTEND OUR APPRECIATION- AN ECHO THE COMMENTS OF THE- ASSEMBLY MEMBER- COME LONGER. CAPTION WITH HER OFFICE PGD FOR WHAT WE KNOW IS THAT A VERY-STRONG COMMITMENT TO COMMUNITY CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION WHICH WE- ABSOLUTELY SHARE- PROBATION IS INCREDIBLY DEDICATED TO A HELP BUT GET. INDIVIDUALIZED READABILITY. TREATY YOUR PATHWAYS- IN PROMOTING PUBLIC SAFETY IN OUR COMMUNITY- AND AS I THINK WITH THE EARLIER. POP CERTAINLY DOES RIGHT NINE. SEARCH AND- OUR- ISSUE THAT WORKING WITH THE YOU. THANKS PACKED AT THE THANK YOU FOR PROVIDING AND SUPPORTS WITHIN THOSE FIRST TWO YEARS OF THEIR PROBATION TERM REALLY IS THAT'S CHANGE THEIR BEHAVIOR AND REDUCE THREE EXPENSE I WOULD JUST ADD HERE THAT I KNOW A LOT OF RESEARCH ON THAT IT'S BROKEN ABOUT. NASH REALLY THAT KIND OF ENCOURAGES COMMITTEE- AND THE LEGISLATURE AS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT- CHANGES TO THE CALIFORNIA SYSTEM TO REALLY LOOK AT ALL OF THE ADVANCEMENTS AND WHERE CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN LEADING THE WAY FOR MANY MANY YEARS. HOW BY ABOUT THE PROGRAM THE SERVICE IN THE FIRST FEW YEARS SB SIX SEVENTY EIGHT WITH CAPTAIN TWO THOUSAND NINE AND REALLY PROVIDED THE FIRST EVER FUNDS TO LOCAL PROBATION BUILDUP INFRASTRUCTURE. ALL AT THE SUPERVISION STRATEGIES AND REALLY COLLECTED OUR SYSTEMS RELYING ON INCARCERATION AND KEEP PEOPLE OUT OF PRISON- WITH THAT PICKED SEVENTY EIGHT FUNDING. THREE ENTRANCE. IS A- FUNCTION THE SUPERVISION PRACTICES THAT AT THAT ADDRESS YOU KNOW. WILL POINT TO REDUCE SET AND AGAIN WITH THE OFFICE GOAL OF THE PUBLIC SAFETY AS WELL I WOULD NEVER GONNA. FORTY WE SB SEVENTY EIGHT HELP REDUCE PRISON BY. BY MORE THAN 30% AFTER THE FACT YEAR OF EMPLOYMENT SHE- AND THE PRESIDENT. BY MORE THAN SIX THOUSAND INMATES AND THE FIRST YEAR ADDITIONALLY THE EIGHT REDUCE. OUR STATE CORRECTIONAL EXPENDITURES BY OVER ONE BILLION DOLLARS SPENT ON EDUCATION AND THAT CERTAINLY I THINK IT CAN HIGHLIGHT THAT AGAIN CALIFORNIA REALLY HAN LEADING THE WAY IN KEEPING PEOPLE- OUT OF INCARCERATION AND THIRTY BETTER IN THE COMMUNITY. AND AGAIN I A HIGH LIKE THIS- AS I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE RECOGNIZE THAT THE SERVICES OF SUPPORTS WITHIN THOSE FIRST TWO YEARS IS REALLY CRITICAL. ACTUALLY AFFECT THAT SHE- THEN THE BELL. SO WHERE THEY WORK. SHOULD THE TERM YOU REALLY BE ALIGNED THE COMPREHENSIVE THE- TO ENHANCE THIRTY AND PROGRAMS. DURING HIS FIRST YEARS AJ ENSURE THAT PROBATION. ARE RECEIVING WHAT THE TO ACHIEVE HELP YOUR CATHOLIC PATHWAYS AND REDUCE RECIDIVISM- SO AGAIN IT'S REALLY THAT CAPACITY IN THOSE FIRST TWO YEARS IN THERE. THE EXISTING FUNDING. CURRENTLY THE UPDATED IN STABLE. TO ADDRESS THIS IN A- WAY TO- SUPPORT OUR CLIENT. SO WE I THINK WE CERTAINLY SURE THAT FOCUS ON EARLY AND EFFECTIVE INVESTMENT- AND LOOK FORWARD TO FURTHER DISCUSSION IN MEDICAID UNINTENDED COM AT IMPACT AND SO- WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING THOSE DISCUSSIONS WITH THE AUTHOR IN THIS COMMITTEE THAT FOR THOSE REASONS WE ARE I RESPECT. THAT CURRENTLY DRAFTED TODAY. THANK YOU. ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. OF NAMING ORGANIZATION WE HAVE SOMEONE IN THE GALLERY RIGHT NOW TO A GUEST DO YOU WANT TO WAIT YES YES. THE CHAIRMAN HUBBARD TO RECALL ON BEHALF OF THE STATE COLUSA PROVISION ORGANIZATIONS IN THE SACRAMENTO COUNTY PROBATION OFFICERS. IN OPPOSITION MISTER CHAIRMAN IF I COULD THIRTY SECONDS I DON'T KNOW IT'S AGAINST THE RULES BUT- I WHAT I DO WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR HER EFFORTS AND I WANNA I WANNA SAY THAT WE'RE IN A GREEN. THE I THINK THE ONE YOU'RE MISDEMEANOR MARKS THE ONE YEAR MAX ON MISDEMEANORS IS PERFECTLY ACCEPTABLE IMPROPER MAKES A LOT OF SENSE. OUR CONCERN IS TO CONSERVE NUMBER ONE IS. THE FUNDING. SB SIX SEVENTY EIGHT WHICH WHICH IS THE TRANSFER OF MONEY FROM STATE TO LOCAL. THAT THAT MONEY IS CONTINGENT UPON SUCCESSFUL NOT ONLY PROVISION OF A REHABILITATION EFFORTS. UNFORTUNATELY MANY REHABILITATION EFFORTS WILL TAKE LONGER TO YEARS AND IF WE DON'T COMPLETE THOSE WE'RE GONNA LOSE THAT MUCH SO THAT THAT'S A THAT'S ONE CONCERT. THE SECOND CONCERN QUITE FRANKLY IS SUCCESS. MANY CRIMES ARE PROBABLY NOT SUITED FOR TWO YEARS PROBATION. VIOLENT CRIMES. SEX CRIMES DRUG ADDICTIONS. AND MISTER LUCKY I'M SURE YOU RECALL PROP THIRTY SIX. WHICH WAS. PROPOSED AS A GREAT SOLUTION TO A DRUG PROBLEM. SO I DID A LOT OF PROP THIRTY SIX CASES WHEN I WAS IN PRIVATE PRACTICE FOR CAN LOOK BEFORE I CAN SACRAMENTO. AND ONE OF THE PROBLEMS WITH PROP THIRTY SIX WAS. THAT THERE WAS REALLY NO INCENTIVE. TO DO WITH REHABILITATION IN EARNEST THE ONLY INCENTIVE WITH SIGNATURE CARD SIGNED. YOU GET FOR YOUR TIME. AND OUR CONCERN IS THAT. A PROGRAM LIKE THIS WHERE YOU WHERE YOU SAY. THE MAXIMUM TIME ON PROBATION IS TWO YEARS. HILL INCENTIVIZE PEOPLE INFORMATION TO GET THROUGH THE TWO YEARS. AND NOT TO BE SERVICE OF A REAL REFLECTION EFFORT AND THAT'S REALLY OUR OUR CONCERN IS THE- WE- PROGRAM SB SIX. IF YOU PUT IF YOU PUT A CAP BUT TO. SOME SORT WILL NOT BE REHABILITATED. BUT BILL RICH THE LINE. AND WE WILL BE. TYPES OF CRIMES WERE OPEN TO THE CONVERSATION WE APPRECIATE THE LET THEM. MISSED CALL LOGGERS.

AMENDMENTS BEEN TALKING ABOUT DO INCLUDE SORT OF EXTENDING TIME FOR THOSE- WHO HAVE COMMITTED A PURELY FINANCIAL CRIME- THERE I'M OPEN TO AMENDMENTS THAT- I'LL OFFER ADDITIONAL TIME OR STATUS QUO TIME FOR THOSE ONLY OFFENDERS. A PENAL CODE SIX SIX SEVEN POINT FIVE WHICH ARE THE MOST EGREGIOUS I THINK THOSE ARE THAT OF CONCERNS REYES ASSEMBLY MEMBER SANTIAGO. I FULLY SUPPORT WHAT THE OPPOSITION SAID ABOUT HOW IMPORTANT IT IS THAT WE HAVE TO FIGHT FOR FUNDING- ESPECIALLY NOW AND WHILE THIS IS A POLICY BILL AND NOT A FISCAL BILL I ENCOURAGE ALL OF US TO WRAP OUR HEADS AROUND AN ARMS AROUND THE FIGHT FOR ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO PROBATION FOR. DEPARTMENT BASED ON SUCCESSFUL MODEL THAT THEY HAVEN'T AS IT RELATES TO TREATMENT AND COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES- THERE WAS COMMENT BY OPPOSITE. THAT SAID YOU WOULD GET OFF A PROBATION ALL YOU HAVE WOULD HAVE LEFT WOULD BE A LITTLE DIFFERENT WANT TO REMIND. THE OPPOSITION IN OF US HERE THAT CIVIL JUDGMENTS LAST FOR TEN YEARS IN FACT CAN GO ON FOREVER AND IT IS VERY COLD TO GET OUT OF THAT. IT IS AS MUCH AN ACCOUNT REMEMBER. IS GOING THROUGHPUT. SOMEONE ASKED DO YOU ARE TO GO IT'S STILL FAR YEARS THAT TO ME VIOLENCE IS STILL EXAM TODAY THREE. YOU KNOW ULTIMATELY. AND LASTLY I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO MENTION THAT PROBATION IS A QUALIFYING SENTENCE YOU IN FACT HAVE TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR PROBATION. AND THAT ELIGIBILITY COMES IN PARTNERSHIP WITH PROBATION THE JUDGES DEFENSE COUNSEL AND THE PROSECUTION- AB FIFTY IS A- IT'S ABOUT A SYMBIOTIC RELATIONAL DESIGN WHERE THE SYSTEM AND THE PROBATIONER WORK BETTER AND DIFFERENTLY ESPECIALLY NOW I LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH- THOSE WHO CURRENTLY OPPOSE THIS- SO THAT WE CAN GET TO pSOME RESOLUTION. AND I'M MORE THAN PROVIDE. ABOUT HOW MANY FOLKS ARE IN PRISON FOR TECHNICAL VIOLATIONS I WANT TO ADD PEOPLE HAVE MENTIONED. CHALLENGES WITH THE DIFFERENT PROGRAMS AS IT RELATES TO BEING ON PROBATION DJJ OFFERS A REALLY GOOD EXAMPLE DJJ WAS HOUSING JUVENILES THEY WERE NOT SUCCEEDING. THE SYSTEM CHANGED HOW IT OPERATED. IT SAID NOW INSTEAD OF HAVING YOU DO ASK FOR NOW GOING TO FOR EXAMPLE HAVE YOU DRAWN. EVERY WEEK FOR FIFTY TWO WEEKS OUT SOMETHING DIFFERENT. SO THAT YOU ARE BECOMING MORE IN TUNE WITH WHAT'S GOING ON WITH YOURSELF WITH WHY YOU WERE HERE. THIS TIME SAID WE'RE GONNA ANTI INVEST IN THE- BECAUSE WE HAVE TO SEE A BETTER RESULT ON THE AND THEY HAVE TO ACCEPT. EIGHT OF RETURN OF IN THE- SYSTEM LOOK AT THE PRODUCT THAT WAS TRYING TO CREATE AND DECIDED IT WAS GOING TO CHANGE SO THAT IT COULD HAVE A HIGHER RATE OF SUCCESS AND THAT IS WHAT WE FIFTY TRYING TO DO I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOU I. THANK YOU AND UP. I JUST WANT. THANK YOU FOR. FOR BEING EXTREMELY GENEROUS. WITH YOUR TIME AND LOOK INTO THE OPPOSITION. AND REASON I KNOW THAT. IS BECAUSE I'VE BEEN IN CONVERSATION NOT ONLY WITH YOU. BUT WHICH OPPOSITION LATE. INTO THE EVENING LAST NIGHT. AND I WOULD ALSO US THAT BOTH THE- HEY MORRISON CD A AA JOIN IN THT CONVERSATION.

AND LISTENING TO SKI SCOPA YOU'VE YOU'VE YOU'VE MADE SOME-YOU WILL NEED TO MAKE SOME CHANGES AND SO I THINK DESERVED IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY. FOR US TO COME TO SOME KIND OF CONSENSUS WE MAY NOT BE 1100% ON BOTH SIDES. BUT IT WILL MAKE THE SYSTEM BETTER. ARE NORMALLY DURING HIS COALBED ECONOMIC CRISIS- I'D WE WERE NOT ADDRESSING A LOT OF THIS BUT YOURS WAS BEING LOOKED AT AT BY THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF AND THEN WE HAD THE BOTTOM SHELF. UP TO CONTINUE PUT TO PUT ON. UNDER PRESSURE ON- ON THE GOVERNOR TO BRING THAT BACK SO LIKE. OTHER BILLS THAT WE'VE WE'VE HEARD THAT NEEDED FINANCIAL HELP OR TO MAKE SURE THAT BUDGET ARE THERE. OF YOU HAD IT ON THE BACK AND- OF. ANOTHER MEMBER THIS SUBSTITUTE IN HERE TODAY THEY HAD SOME BY AND FROM FROM BUDGET AND SO- LET'S LET'S ALSO. I WANT TO FORGET THAT WE INCLUDING. WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO PUSH FOR FUNDING IN PROBATION SO THEY COULD BE SUCCESSFUL ESPECIALLY DURING THIS ECONOMIC DOWNTURN. BECAUSE THE LAST THING YOU WE WANT THAT ALL OF THIS BECOMES MOVED. BECAUSE WE GO BACKWARDS ON THE ABILITY ATION AND WE DON'T HELP PROBATION OR PAROLE UP TO FILL THEIR THEIR OBLIGATIONS BECAUSE WE UNDER FUNDED OR WE DON'T HELP SO I LOOK AT IT'S GOING ALONG TO RAILS AND IF WE ALL COME TOGETHER BOTH I DEFENDERS AND BASS I THINK HE APOLLO MESSAGE ALLOW LAW FOR W.

RETROACTIVE DO A TESTING IS KNOWN TO CONSOLIDATE CRIMES ASSISTING INVESTIGATORS TO IDENTIFY PATTERNS OF CRIMINALITY. BUDGET OCCASION OF SEX CRIMES IS OF THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE.

ON EDUCATION FINANCE SO- THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR FOR- ALLOW ME TO PRESENT TO AB TWO THREE SIX TWO- WHICH IS A BILL THAT WILL GIVE THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF JSTICE. AUTHORITY TO IMPOSE CIVIL FINES ON GUN DEALERS WHO DO NOT COMPLY WITH OUR GUN SAFETY LAWS. DURING THIS PANDEMIC WE HAVE SEEN A DRAMATIC SPIKE IN GUN SALES WITH CROWDS LINING UP TO PURCHASE GUNS FROM GUN DEALERS. ACCORDING TO THE US BUREAU OF ALCOHOL TOBACCO AND FIREARMS GUN DEALERS ARE A LEADING SOURCE OF GUNS ON THE BLACK MARKET A RESPONSIBLE FOR NEARLY HALF OF THE TOTAL PER OF TRAFFIC FIRE ARMS UNCOVERED IN A TF INVEST.

GUNS COMING FROM GUN DEALERS AND GOING BEING USED IN IN CRIME GUN DEALERSIN CALIFORNIA ARE SOME OF THE CLEANEST ACROSS THE COUNTRY. THAT IS NOT EVEN ARGUABLE- A POSITION ON NUMBER TWO. THE LANGUAGE OF THE BILL CALLS FOR THOSE DEALERS THAT HAVE REPEATEDLY- BROKEN THE LAW NOT FOLLOW THE LAW NOT FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS. AND FOR THOSE DEALERS THEY IT'S OKAY TO REMOVE THEIR LICENSE THAT IS ALL RIGHT WHAT WE'RE DOING NOW IS WE'RE SETTING UP A SYSTEM OF FIND SOMEBODY'S. YOU KNOW THERE'S GOING TO BE CONCERNED SAID WELL THE DEPARTMENT NEEDS MONEY WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO SET SOME QUARTERS OKAY EVERY INSPECTOR GOES OUT MAKE SURE THAT YOU FIND SOME MINOR WHATEVER KIND OF VIOLATION. IN ORDER TO LET THE APPLYING AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO BE ABLE TO DO OUR WORK AND MOST IMPORTANTLY THE FACT THAT. THE GUN DEALERS AND THE GUN BUYING PUBLIC IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. HAS REALLY NO ABILITY TO COMMUNICATE WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. YOUR CALL. YOU YOU GET A BUSY LINE YOUR NO ANSWERS OR YOU LEAVE A MESSAGE AND NOBODY RETURNS A CALL. IN ORDER TO REQUEST INFORMATION ON THE GUN LAWS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO NOW WE ARE BEING ASKED AS DEALERS. TO SUPPORT A MEASURE THAT WILL ALLOW DOJ TO FIND US. WHEN WE ARE GOING TO THEM TO ASK THEM. WHAT IT IS THAT WE NEED TO DO IN ORDER TO BEGIN COMPLIANCE THAT IS COMPLETELY NOT FAIR.

AS WELL AS CONCERNS WITH WHERE TO FIND MONEY DOES FLOW AND COULD THAT- INCLUDES AGGRESSIVE PORTAL PROGRESSIVE ENFORCEMENT AS WE'VE SEEN THINGS AS WAS MENTIONED BY THE PROPONENTS OF THE CHANGE. THAT TIME CHANGED SEVERAL TIMES OVER THE LAST COUPLE YEARS IT COULD BE. A SIGN THAT. CHANGE THREE TIMES IN THE LAST BECAUSE TO THE LONG FOR RESULT IN THOUSAND ALL FINE TO SMALL THIS THAT COULD OF THE- KEEPING OUR GOAL OPEN AT. DURING TIMES WITHOUT WERE OPPOSITE THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

THAT THE NATIONAL SHOOTING SPORTS FOUNDATION DIRECTOR OF GOVERNMENT RELATIONS WE REPRESENT- A LOT OF THE RETAILERS AS WELL AS MANUFACTURERS AND SHOOTING RANGES AND STATUS WALLS EVERYWHERE IN THEUNITED STATES. WE ARE IN STRONG OPPOSITION OF THIS BILL ONE THING THAT I'D LIKE TO ON ECHO THAT THE OTHER FOLKS IT ECHOED- IN OPPOSITION HERE. IS THIS WOULD OPEN UP A LITTLE VIOLATIONS- Q. LITTLE SMALL VIOLATIONS TO POTENTIAL MONETARY VIOLATIONS AND GET DE OKAY THAT OPPORTUNITY TO FIND HER FOLKS. ON AS DâN READ WITH NATIONAL RIFLE ASSOCIATION MENTIONED EARLIER THE WARNING LABEL COULD ACCOMPANY ALL FIRE ARMS FOR INSTANCE HAVE BEEN CHANGED THREE TIMES OVER THE PAST YEAR AND A HALF. IF YOU FOR INSTANCE UNDER THIS BILL HAD THE OLD WARNING LABEL FROM LAST YEAR AND DIDN'T USE THAT OVER. OBJECT TO THE LINES THERE ARE A MULTITUDE OF ALL. TESTIMONY THAT UNDERLYING SOME OF THESE OTHER EXAMPLES AS WELL. BUT TO THE MYRIAD OF REASONS- AND SMALL POTENTIAL VIOLATIONS WE ARE OPPOSITION OF THIS BILL. THANK YOU SIR. I KNOW OTHER PARTICIPANTS CUED UP AT THIS TIME GAY WILL BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE MEMBERS ARE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. AND YOU BRING IT BACK TO YOU MISTER MURATSUCHI AND IF YOU COULD ADDRESS. SOME ISSUES ESPECIALLY DOJ AS WE KNOW BEING ABLE TO ACTUALLY IMPLEMENT. THIS THIS THIS NEW POLICY CERTAINLY SO- THE BILL- IN ADDITION TO AUTHORIZING THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE TO BE ABLE TO- TO HAVE THE AUTHORITY AND THE DISCRETION- IMPOSE A FINE- IT ALSO CALLS FOR ADOPTING REGULATIONS- AND AS WELL AS TO PROVIDE AND AN APPEAL PROCESS. SO INDIVIDUALS THAT- OUR OUR FIND WOULD HAPPEN TO- AN OPPORTUNITY TO APPEAL ANNIE- HEARING OR UNFAIR- FINES BUT- I THINK AS THE REPRESENTATIVE FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE- INDICATED- THIS IS A TOOL- LIKE. SIMILAR TO WHAT THE- THE- A. B. C. BOARD THE ALCOHOL- BORDEAUX SIMILAR POSSESSES MANY- PUBLIC ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO IMPOSE- WHAT ARE CALLED ADMINISTRATIVE FINES. WE ALL OF PUNISHING THE- THE NON COMPLIANT BUT TO SEE COMPLIANCE AND SO YOU KNOW I THE ALTERNATIVE AS THE DOJ REPRESENTATIVE INDICATED IS TO REVOKE A LICENSE AND I AM SURE THE GUN OWNERS OF CALIFORNIA GUN OWNERS OF AMERICA WOULD. OPPOSED ATTEMPTS T. COMPLIANCE BY HAVING THEIR THEIR LICENSE THREATEN TO BE REVOKED AND SO THIS IS TO PROVIDE. A MIDDLE GROUND PROVIDE DISCRETION FOR- THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE TO BE ABLE TO ENFORCE. OUR GUN SAFETY LAWS WHICH IS YOU KNOW GO BEYOND. MERE PAPERWORK VIOLATIONS IN THE FOR EXAMPLE FROM THE LETTER FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE THEY INDICATE TO YOU KNOW DEALER RECORDS- MAKING SURE THAT THAT- LAW ENFORCEMENT WELL THIS IS THE OJ AS OUR RECORDS IN TERMS OF WHO AND WHEN- THESE GOOD SALES TAKE PLACE WAIT PERIOD CHOIR THIS MAY. IT THOSE THAT HAVE A GUN VIOLENCE RESTRAINING ORDES- YOU KNOW THAT THEIR RECORDS- YOU KNOW YOU TO BE TO TRACK WHO GUNS ARE BEING SOLD TO- WHETHER THE WAITING PERIODS ARE ARE ARE BEING COMPLIED WITH IN TERMS OF. ANYONE CONVICTED OF THE OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IN TWO TO MAKE SURE THAT THE OUT AWAITING COMPLIED. THESE ARE. TO GUN SAFETY LAWS THAT- THIS COMMITTEE- WORKS HARD TO- TO- VAN AND TO REVIEW AND TO PASS- IN ORDER TO- REDUCE GUN VIOLENCE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND SO THIS IS AN IMPORTANT TOOL- THAT- YOU KNOW. WE SEE TO THAT THAT I AM OPPOSED TO- BY TWO THE CALIFORNIA PART JUSTICE TO USE IN THEIR PROPER DISCRETION. TO ENFORCE COMPLIANCE AND SAVE. ON CALIFORNIA RIFLE ASSOCIATION GUN OWNERS AND EVEN THE ARRAY- HAVE A VALID POINT ABOUT. MAKING SURE THAT DOJ I MEAN FOR US YOU KNOW YOU PAYMENT CAME IN WITH ME IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE WE ALL HAVE CONCERNED WHETHER NOT. THE DEPARTMENT JUSTICE CAN ACTUALLY IMPLEMENT SOMETHING- MUCH LESS THEM OVER PRESCRIBING OR OVER. PENALIZING PEOPLE TO PAD THEIR THEIR BUDGETS THEY'RE HAVING TROUBLE JUST TRYING TO KEEP UP WITH THE WORKLOAD MUCH LESS GOING OVERBOARD AND TRIED IT WANTED THINGS THAT HELPS YOU AND HELPS ME GET ME SOME. THAT GO LEASE BE ABLE TO GET IT DONE. SHE HAD DEPARTMENT JUSTICE SIGNING ON THAT'S WHY YOU'RE TO TAKE A DATE THEY ARE INTO THEY WANT BE INCOME. IN IN YOUR LAW THEY WERE TO MAKE SURE YOU GET IT GETS DONE I WOULD URGE YOU TO MAKE. THAT WE SOME SOME MECCA. PLACE EVEN THOUGH I DON'T THINK IT. SURE THAT. LIKE IN YOUR SMALLEST NOT YOUR SMALL CITY IN THE LAW OF SMALL SOME SMALL SO THEY USED AS A WAY OF OR BUDGETS DURING DOWNTURN THE ECONOMY SO WE DON'T WANT TO OVER REGULATE JUST. BUILD UP A BUDGETS BECAUSE- I'M SURE THE DOJ. AND IS THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S WILL ALL BE X. SOME. DRAMATIC CUT INTO BUDGET AND SO IF YOU COULD. PROVIDE SOME COMFORT IS BEING FOR I'VE AM IN. SO OF IT TODAY COULD NOT HOLD BACK FOR WINNING TO FLOW BECAUSE THE FLOOR BUT- COULD YOU SEE HAD THAT BUDGET FOR THE GOAL. OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS TO MAKE SURE. THE OF JOE JUDGE WITH ONLY GIVE IT DONE BUT IT IT DONE CORRECTLY AND WE DON'T HARM ANY. IN THIS IF THERE TO LEAVE THINGS THAT THEY NEED TO BE DOING. I MAKE A SURE THEY HAVE A- THERE THE POST WHAT NEEDS TO BE. AND THAT WE DO HER ARM A SMALL BIT SPACE HEATER. DOING THE- BIT INTO. IF ANY WOULD PROBABLY SHOULD BE. OF SO THEY CAN STAY IN BUSINESS SO WITH THAT RECOMMENDING AYE VOTE. YOU MAY CALL. I'M AB TWENTY THREE SIXTY MORE CHEAT MOTION IS TO PASS TO THE A PRO COMMITTEE JONES SAWYER HI JOHN YOUR EYES.

THAT'S OKAY DON'T KNOW WHAT THIS MADE HAVE BEEN. HAVE A HARD TIME GETTING IN HERE WELL. WE CAN GET YOU A MESSAGE BRIEF I. YEAH I'VE GOT THOUGHT OF MY- CC A COUPLE HOLES IN BUT THAT YOU KNOW THE PIZZA PER NOT DOESN'T WORK. TO POST A PUBLIC NOTICE. OF THE ROOSTERS AE OTHER FIGHTING ANIMALS USED IN ILLEGAL FIGHTS- IT ON AN ONLINE SOURCE RATHER THAN SOLELY WITH HARD COPY NEWSPAPERS. ILLEGAL ANIMAL FIGHTING IS A HIGHLY AGGRESSIVE GAMBLING SPORT DIAPER PROBABLY ALL FAMILIAR WITH THE- **** FIGHTS IN THE DOG FIGHTS THOSE KINDS OF THINGS IT'S A SPECIALTY. PERVASIVE IN IN CENTRAL CALIFORNIA. AND OUR SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT HAS AN AWFUL LOT OF ENFORCEMENT WORK. AND THEY HAVE BROUGHT THIS TO OUR ATTENTION AND THE SHARES ARE GOING TO COMMENT ON WHY THEY THINK THIS IS IMPORTANT BUT- WE HAVE PEOPLE ON THE STE IT ACTUALLY TRAVEL. FOR THESE BITING SEASONS- STARTS IN FEBRUARY LAST UNTIL- THE TEMPERATURES GET A LITTLE WARMER GENTLE CALIFORNIA. SO HERE'S THE IT THE PROBLEM IS WHEN LAW ENFORCEMENT APPEARS AT THESE FIGHTS IT IS COMMON FOR ATTENDEES TO FLEE. TO AVOID ARREST THEY MANY TIMES LEAVE THAT BIRDS OR OTHER ANIMALS BEHIND. THE LAW ENFORCEMENT AND TAKES POSSESSION OF THE ANIMALS AND FILES A PETITION WITH THE COURT TO HUMANELY EUTHANIZE THEM. BEFORE DOING SO CURRENT LAW REQUIRES A PUBLIC NOTICE OF DESTRUCTION OF THE ANIMALS TO BE POSTED IN A HARD COPY NEWSPAPER. MOVED AND SECONDED YES IT WITH ARCH I JUST ASK FOR.

YOUR THAN YOU. THE ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT OF. YEAH PLEASE PRESS ONE ZERO HIGH IF YOU'D LIKE TO. THE PUBLIC. NOBODY ELSE Q. UP AT THE TIME NOW WILL HAVE IN OPPOSITION HELLO MISTER MODERATOR. I HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN A RESTAURANT ZERO YOU WOULD LIKE TO BE A WITNESS IN OPPOSITION JIM IT WORKS THE CALIFORNIA NEWSPAPERS ASSOCIATION AND KATHY SURE ACLU OF CALIFORNIA. WHERE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE JIMMY WORK FOR THE CALIFORNIA NEWS PUBLISHERS ASSOCIATION. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME TODAY. WELL WE ARE OPPOSED TO AB. THIRTY THIRTY FIVE. BEACH PUBLIC NOTICES ARE INTENDED TO REACH- TARGETED AUDIENCES IN COMMUNITIES SO THAT WHEN AN ANIMAL- AND ITS OWNER- HAVE BEEN SEPARATED FOR WHATEVER REASON- ANY OWNER IS ON THE TABLE. THE LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES UNABLE TO REACH THE OWNER TO INFORM THEM THAT THE ANIMALS ABOUT TO BE DESTROYED OF IT CAN INFORM OTHERS IN THE COMMUNITY HE MAY KNOW WHO THE OWNER IS SO THAT- THEY CAN BE INFORMED- ABOUT THE ABILITY TO- GET THEIR GET THEIR ANIMAL. AND DO FACT MISS OF THESE NOTICES REALLY IS UNPARALLELED- THROUGH THE USE OF NEWSPAPERS BECAUSE NEWSPAPERS ARE PUSHED INTO THE COMMUNITY SO THAT WHEN SOMEONE PICKS UP A NEWSPAPER WHERE THEY LOOK TO FIND NEWS AND INFORMATION ABOUT LOCAL COMMUNITY. EVENTS AND OCCURRENCES- THEY HAVE A SERENDIPITOUS EXPERIENCE AS THEY ARE GOING TO THE USE OF THE NEWSPAPER AND AFFECTED WHICH STOP ALONG THE RANGE THAT THEY MEAN INTEND TO LOOK FOR. FIFTIES ARE ONLY POSTED ON WINE- OR THROUGH SOCIAL MEDIA THAT SAME- SERENDIPITOUS. AFFECT DOES NOT TAKE PLACE. PEOPLE WHO GO TO PAY FOR GO FOR A SPECIFIC PURPOSE AND ONCE THEY HAVE OBTAINED THE INFORMATION THAT THEY ARE LOOKING FOR- THEY LEAVE THAT WEBSITE- VERY FEW PEOPLE GO TO GOVERNMENT WEBSITES TO OBTAIN. GENERAL INFORMATION NOT TO MENTION THE FACT THAT WEBSITE ARE NOT SECURE WHEN A PUBLIC NOTICE IS PUBLISHED IN A NEWSPAPER OF GENERAL CIRCULATION. IT IS PRINTED ON- A NEW STRENGTH AND YOU CAN FIND THAT ANYWHERE BUT IF IT'S ONLINE THINGS HAPPEN WEBSITES CAN BE HACKED- THEY CAN BE- POWER CAN GO DOWN- THERE INSTANCES WHERE- THEY ARE EVEN HELD FOR RANSOM- UNTIL- IT IS PAID AND- WITH. THAT INFORMATION CAN THEN BE RELEASED TO THE PUBLIC- AS FAR AS THE INVOICE THAT WAS USED TO JUSTIFY THIS BILL- MY UNDERSTANDING AND TALKING WITH THE PUBLISHER OF THE NEWSPAPER. IS THAT THAT AD WAS NEVER PUBLISHED AND- SO. WHILE IT MAY APPEAR TO BE EXCESSIVE IN COST- I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THAT WITH SEVERAL- THAT WAS NEVER PAID- AND PUBLISHED. ALSO WANT TO SHOULD THAT BE TYPES OF NOTICES AFFECT COMMUNITIES ALL OVER THE STATE NOT JUST IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY SO THESE NOTICES THAT ARE PUBLISHED IN NEWSPAPERS LIKE LOPPING YOUR OWN OR OTHER COMMUNITY BASED PUBLICATIONS- WOULD ALSO BE AFFECTED BY THIS AND- NOT A- YOU. HAVING NOTICES POSTED ON WINE IN ADDITION TO THE REQUIREMENT THAT THEY BE PUBLISHED IN A NEWSPAPER OF GENERAL CIRCULATION IN FACT SEEN PEERING HAS ITS OWN WEBSITE WHERE WE UPLOAD NOTED IS FROM ALL OF OUR MEMBERS PUBLICATIONS JUST FOR THAT PURPOSE. BUT OUR OBJECTION IS THAT THIS IS GOING TO CREATE A SITUATION WHERE THOSE NOTICES ARE PUBLISHED IN LIEU OF THAT PUBLISHED NOTICE IN A NEWSPAPER. AND UP FOR THAT WE CAN- WE ARE URGING YOU TO VOTE NO ON THIS. THANK YOU THANK YOU SIR. AND MEASURE ACLU YEAH. THANK YOU YES THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR NUMBERS KATHY SURE FOR THE ACLU OF CALIFORNIA- WE RESPECTFULLY ALSO MUST OPPOSE. EIGHTY THIRTY THIRTY FIVE. SB THIRTY THIRTY FIVE LOOSENS THE REQUIREMENTS FOR PUBLICATION OF NOTICED BY LAW ENFORCEMENT WHEN. IN CONNECTION WITH ILLEGAL COCKFIGHTING OPERATIONS ARE GOING TO BE DESTROYED THE APPLICATION IN THIS BILL IS A VERY SPECIFIC ONE BUT THE PRINCIPLE. INVOLVED ARE BROADLY APPLICABLES AND IMPORTANT WHEN THE GOVERNMENT SEIZES PROPERTY AND INTENDS TO DESTROY IT OR FOR THAT PERMANENTLY IT MUST GIVE NOTICE IN A WAY. THAT IS. THAT CAN EFFECTIVELY REACH THOSE WITH AN INTEREST IN THE PROPERTY THERE ARE NUMEROUS PROVISIONS OF LAW THAT SET OUT GET THAT IN DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES SET OUT THE REQUIREMENTS FOR HEALTH SUCH NOTICE MUST BEPROVIDED. REQUIREMENTS ARE INTENDED TO ENSURE THAT NOTICES NOTED THAT PUBLISHED IN AN INDEPENDENT FORM BUT THE FACT OF NOTICE CAN BE INDEPENDENTLY VERIFIED THAT THERE IS A RECORD OF THE NOTICE AND THAT THE NOTICES. WILL TO EVER WANT AND THAT IT IS GIVEN IN A WAY THAT MAXIMIZES LET IT INTO A PARTY WILL YET. NEWSPAPER NOTICES THE IT'S REQUIREMENTS THERE MAY BE OTHER WAYS TO MEET THEM AS WELL BUT ALLOWING NOTICE TO BE PUBLISHED ON QUOTE A SOCIAL MEDIA OUTLET BELONGING PEOPLE ON. YOUR COUNTY OR LOCAL GOVERNMENT ENTITY OR LONG ARGUMENT IN. ON SURELY NOT. WITH CAPTION IT WILL BECOME A STEP MATTER LAUNCH A TO ARE OR- VERY AND NOTIFY THE FATE FEED NO ONE WILL BE REDUCED FOR THIS PURPOSE AND AIRPORT BUT NO ONE. THIS MAY NOT SEEM LIKE IT MATTERS MUCH ONE. ABOUT THESE PRISONERS. BUT IF THE STANDARD FOR PUBLICATION IS CHANGED IN THIS WAY HERE WE WILL SEE PROPOSAL IT CHANGED ELSEWHERE WHEN MUCH MORE THEY BE AT STAKE AND WHAT YOU DO TODAY MADE THE- MODEL FOR. JAMES AND- WE URGE YOU NOT TO CHANGE REQUIREMENTS WITHOUT CAREFUL THOUGHT. WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR NOBLE. THANK YOU ARE THERE ANY OTHERS IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. NAME AN ORGANIZATION MODERATOR AN ESN OF ON THE PHONE LINES IF YOU ARE NOT POSITION PLEASE PRESS ONE ZERO AT THIS TIME PLEASE PRESS ONE ZERO FOR OPPOSITION. AND NOBODY IS QUEUING UP AT THIS TIME. THANK THANK YOU ARE ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. YES MA'AM CARILLO. THANK YOU MISTER PATTERSON- I ACTUALLY THINK YOUR BILL IS. VERY ON POINT- AND- IN TUNE WITH THE WAY IN WHICH A LOT OF CONSUMERS RECEIVE THEIR NEWS RECEIVE THEIR MEDIA AND I'M TOTALLY AN ONBOARD AND SUPPORTING IT I DO WANT TO CLARIFY SOME OF THE- COMMENTS ARE MADE OVER THE PHONE. IS THIS- WHAT ADVERTISING ON A NINE MONTH ONLINE NEWSPAPER SAY LIKE. THE LA TIMES ONLINE ORDER SHALL BE NEON ONLINE WHICH WAS BROUGHT UP OVER THE PHONE OR THROUGH THE LAW ENFORCEMENT SOCIAL MEDIA IS THAT DOES NOT REPLACE OR THAT IN ADDITION TO. THE NEWSPAPER ADVERTISEMENT THE ANALOGY REST. AB DIP SPECIFICALLY. THIS IS AN ATTEMPT TO UPDATE THE CODE. BY ALLOWING LAW ENFORCEMENT TO POST THE SAME CONTENT IS REQUIRED IN A HARD COPY NEWSPAPER ON THESE OTHER OUTLETS WEBSITES- AGENCIES GOVERNMENT ENTITIES ITS AFTER ANY INCLUDING NEWSPAPER WEBSITES. THE BUT WE HAVE THE ACT THE ADVENT OF THE INTERNET AND- IT IS CLEAR THAT THE PUBLIC NO LONGER RELIES SOLELY ON PRINT. NEWSPAPERS TO LOOK FOR LOST POSSESSIONS LEARN ABOUT LOCAL NEWS AT ITS ADDRESS WHAT WE'RE DOING IS WE'RE ALLOWING LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES TO PUBLISH NOTICES ONLINE THAT WOULD ALLOW THEM THE AFFORDABILITY I WANT TO GET TO THE COST YOU IN A SEC THE AFFORDABILITY. OF DOING THIS IN MULTIPLE LANGUAGES TARGETING MORE SPECIFICALLY AND FURTHER INCREASING ACCESS AND AWARENESS WITH THE CURRENT CODE AGENCY SIMPLY CANNOT AFFORD TO DIVERSIFY AND TO RUN- WITHOUT. PAYING FOR THIS MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS AND I MUSTSAY WITH VERY LITTLE OR NO RESULTS IN OTHER WORDS. THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS REQUIRED TO PUBLISH. ARE IN OF PRINT NEWSPAPER IN WHICH THERE'S A MASSIVE AMOUNT OF OTHER NOTICES- IT LEGAL NOTICES AT CENTER IF YOU TALK TO THE SHERIFF'S THEY WILL SAY THEY SPEND ALL KINDS OF MONEY AND THEY GET LITTLE OR NO RISK. AND THEY BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE MORE TARGETED WAYS BUT IT COMES DOWN TO A PRICE TAG THAT. A IT'S SO THAT THEIR OPPOSITION REFERENCE THIS EIGHT THOUSAND DOLLAR- PRICE TAG FOR ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY SEVEN LINES OF SMALL TYPE FOR THREE DAYS. THE END THE GENTLEMAN WAS CORRECTED THEY DID THEY DIDN'T PAY IT WHY BECAUSE THE BIRDS IN QUESTION ALL DIED. BEFORE THEY PUBLISHED THE AT. AND SO THEY WITHDREW THE AT. THIS IS A STE. S. SAMPLING OF THE KIND OF QUOTATION- THAT THE NEWSPAPERS PROVIDE ADDITIONALLY I HAVE GONE AND WE FOUND A COULD GOTTEN QUOTES AS EARLY AS TODAY FROM THREE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA NEWSPAPERS RANGING FROM FORTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS TO ELEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS. REQUIRING LAW ENFORCEMENT TO POST IN HARD COPY NEWSPAPERS IS NOT ONLY OUTDATED BUT IT IS VERY VERY EXPENSIVE. AGAIN ELEVEN SOMETHING LIKE TO EIGHT THOUSAND DOLLARS THE FRESNO BEE ELEVENTH DOLLARS I THINK IN THE LAW THEN THE LA AREA WHEN THE LA NEWSPAPERS. TURN IT IN THIS IS. APPLES AND APPLES. A HUNDRED AND THIRTY SEVEN LINE OF SMALL TYPE FOR THREE DAYS EIGHT THOUSAND DOLLARS IN FRESNO ELEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS THE END OF THE CENTER CALIFORNIA IMAGINE- THE AFFORDABILITY OF BEING ABLE TO- TAYLOR AND USE THAT THAT- THE INTERNET. MEDIA LOOK. CURRENT LAW AND THE OPPOSITION SUGGESTS THAT YEAH THERE MAY BE SOME PRECEDENT IN HERE I'M NOT SUGGESTING THAT AND I'M NOT PUSHING IT BUT LET ME SAY THIS. CURRENT LAW SETS UP AN OUTDATED MONOPOLY FOR HARD COPY NEWSPAPERS AS A RESULT THEY CAN CHARGE MONOPOLY RATES BECAUSE THERE IS NO. OTHER OPTION THIS BILL PROVIDES AT NUMEROUS OPTIONS INCLUDING THE WEBSITES OF THESE NEWSPAPERS AND SO WITH THAT I'M I'M ASKING. FOR YOUR AYE VOTE ODD. THE BED SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENTS- POLICE AUTHORITIES CAN DO WHAT THEY WANT IF THEY WANT TO SPEND. ELEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR A HUNDRED THIRTY SEVEN LINES FOR THREE DAYS. OKAY FINE BUT- WE'RE GIVING THEM THE OPTION. TO GO AND DO THIS A DIFFERENT WAY AND IT WOULD BE JUST AS- ACCEPTABLE WITH RESPECT TO OFFICIAL NOTIFICATION. AND I VENTURE TO DISAGREE WITH THE NOTION THAT- ONLY THE NEWSPAPERS CAN ARCHIVE. THAT'S JUST THAT'S JUST THE TECHNOLOGICAL LEAD INCORRECT BUT THE FUNDAMENTAL PLACE WHERE THIS IS ARCHIVED IS WITH THE COURTS. THAT REQUIRE THE NOTIFICATION ANYBODY ANYTIME CAN CAN GO FIND THIS AT THE COURT IT'S ARE ARCHIVED THERE AS WELL SO FOR THESE REASONS I THINK THIS IS APPROPRIATE- MODERNIZATION MOVING INTO THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY IN HE DIGITAL AGE AND PROVIDES FOR MUCH LESS AMOUNTS OF MONEY FOR MUCH. TARGETED AND SPECIFIED. I INFORMATION THAT HAS AYE MUCH HIGHER LIKELIHOOD OF REACHING THOSE WHO NEED TO HEAR IT BECAUSE IT'S DIVERSIFIED IN DIFFERENT LANGUAGES AND IS AFFORDABLE FOR THOSE REASONS I'M ASKING FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU. YOU COULD YOU COULD. BUT SO YOU MAY ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. YOU MAKE BAD CONSIDER MY CLOTHES OKAY SO I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS ALSO MIGHT. INVOLVEMENT IN A NEWSPAPERS AND PUBLICATIONS- WAS AS DIRECTOR REAL ESTATE TO SEE BELLI. I WE WOULD HAVE TO NOTICE WHENEVER WE HAD AN AUCTION OF CITY PROPERTY. AND I JUST REMEMBER. THAT STAFF WITHIN GOVERNMENT WITHIN THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES WHAT ONLY ADVERTISE INTHE LA TIMES AND WHEN I PUSH TO HAVE IT OUT ADVERTISING LOPPING YOUR OWN REALLY SET NO. THE BILL TOKIO NEWS FILIPINO TOWN IN ETHNIC NEWSPAPERS THEY REFUSE TO. AND THEY SAID THOSE INDIVIDUALS READ DAILY TIMES AND NOT THE OTHER WAY AROUND. AND IT WOULD NOT. GIVE MONEY TO THE SMALLER PUBLICATIONS IT USED TO DRIVE ME CRAZY. I FORCED HIM TO AND I'M PRETTY SURE AFTER I BLESSED THE ONLY- ADVERTISING. IN THE LA TIMES IN A LARGER PAPERS IN A HAVE NOT GONE BACK. TO THAT AND SO PERSONAL. I'VE ALWAYS BELIEVED DICK THIS IS BACK WHEN WE DIDN'T HAVE THE INTERNET WHEN WE DIDN'T HAVE YOU KNOW. A WEBSITE FACEBOOKAND SOCIAL MEDIA THIS THIS IS MY IDEA WAS TO GET THE WORD OUT TO AS MANY NEWSPAPER. AFFILIATES ESPECIALLY IN AREAS THAT DON'T NORMALLY GET A CHANCE TO BUY OR TO GO TO AN AUCTION FOR CITY PROPERTY. AND SO- BUT IT. THE BILL THE ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO REACH AS MANY. FOLKS AS POSSIBLE IS REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT TO ME. AND IT'S REALLY WOULD THINK SHOULD BE REALLY IMPORTANT TO EVERYONE. THAT WE ALL TRY TO TALK TO EVERYBODY ON EVERY MEDIA- AND INCLUDING DAILY TIMES HAS THEIR OWN. WAY OF POSTING THINGS BECAUSE THAT'S HOW I GET MY NEWS I DON'T GET A HARD COPY PAPER ANYMORE.

CITY SEE OUR INCORPORATION WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FORESTRY AND FIRE PROTECTION AND THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY FIRE DEPARTMENT JOINTLY OPERATE FORTY THREE CONSERVATION CAMPS OR FIRE CAMPS IN TWENTY SEVEN COUNTIES. THIS FIRE CAMP SUPPORT LOCAL STATE AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AS A RESPONSE. SEE SUCH AS FIRES FLOW. AND OTHER NATURAL OR MANMADE DISASTERS. ALL INCARCERATED FIRE CAMP WORKERS RECEIVE THE SAME ENTRY LEVEL TRAINING THE CALIFORNIA- SEASONAL FIREFIGHTERS RECEIVE. IN ADDITION TO ONGOING TRAINING FROM CAL FIRE HELL FIRE WHILE THEY REMAIN IN THE PROGRAM. THESE INDIVIDUALS ARE VETTED AND MUST FIRST EARNED THEIR RIGHT TO WORK IN A CONSERVATION CAMP.

GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS KATIE TENDO AND I'M A CLINICAL PROFESSOR OF LAW AND DIRECTOR OF THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE CLINIC AT UC IRVINE SCHOOL OF LAW. I REPRESENT INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE. CONNECTION I AM VERY FAMILIAR WITH THE BIG BEARS AND HURDLES FORMALLY IN. ALL STATE WHEN SEEKING OF ON FROM PAST MISTAKES. IN THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE HAS MADE GREAT STRIDES IN PROVIDING FORMERLY INCARCERATED IN VISUAL WAY. THEIR CONVICTION. HOWEVER INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE CONVICTED OF FELONIES STILL FACE AN ENORMOUS BARRIERS IN GETTING THIS RELIEF AND OFTEN HAVE DIFFICULTIES FINDING MANY EMPLOYMENT. UNDER THE LAW MANY INDIVIDUALS COMMIT A FELONY AND ARE SENTENCED TO A TERM IN COUNTY JAIL ARE NOT ELIGIBLE TO EXPAND THEIR CONVICTIONS UNTIL ONE TWO YEARS AFTER THE RELEASE FROM CUSTODY. THE PROGRAM MY CAMP OR DEMONSTRATE OTHER REMARK READ. LIKE SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETING RESIDENTIAL DRUG TREATMENT. BUT THESE ARE THE HURDLES FACED BY INDIVIDUALS WHO SERVE THEIR TIMING COUNTY JAIL MOST INDIVIDUAL TO SERVE THEIR SENTENCE IN STATE PRISON EVEN IF THE SHORT TERM. TWO YEARS. NO MATTER THE EXTENT REHABILITATION THESE INDIVIDUALS ARE NEVER ABLE TO SEEK AN EXPUNGEMENT UNDER INDIVIDUALS MUSCLE THE MINIMUM OF SEVEN YEARS AND THEN THEY ARE ONLY ABLE TO APPLY FOR A CERTIFICATE OF REHABILITATION A LIMITED FORM OF RELIEF THAT DOES NOT. THE CONNECTION FOR SOMETHING PURPOSES. IT IS IMPORTANT FOR MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE TO KNOW THAT EVEN ONCE INDIVIDUALS ARE ELIGIBLE TO APPLY FOR AN EXPUNGEMENT- CERTIFICATE REHABILITATION. IT IS NOT CERTAIN BY ANY MEANS THAT THE COURT WILL GRANT IT. CRIMINAL COURTS ARE HIGHLY LOCALIZED THE DECISION IS IN THE HANDS OF AN INDIVIDUAL JUDGE AND THE OPINION OF THE- PROSECUTOR IS OFTEN VERY AND SHALL. REQUEST FOR EXPUNGEMENT AND CERTIFICATES OF REHABILITATION ARE OFTEN DO NOT. THIS BILL WOULD ALLOW AN INDIVIDUAL EXACTLY COMPLETED ONE OF THE FIRE CAN'T PROGRAM TO BE ELIGIBLE TO APPLY FOR PUNISHMENT UPON HIS OR HER RELEASE FROM CUSTODY. WOULD CREATE OPPORTUNITY IS IMMEDIATELY RATHER THAN HAVING THIS INDIVIDUAL WAIT YEARS BEFORE HERE SHE COULD TRY TO MOVE FORWARD IN A PROFESSIONAL CAREER. THIS TIME IN ITS CREDIT. IT IS UPON A PERSON'S RELEASED FROM CUSTODY WHEN THEY MOST NEED A PATHWAY TO EMPLOYMENT. STORIES LIKE WE'LL HOPEFULLY HEAR FROM FOR. REMIND US IS WHY THERE IS ANY GIVE PEOPLE THE OPPORTUNITY TO IMPROVE THEIR LIVES. BY ALLOWING A PERSON TO APPLY FOR AN EXPUNGEMENT WITH DEMONSTRATED IMPRESSIVE REHABILITATION BUT THE CATHOLIC COMPLETING FIRE CAN'T.

WE BELIEVE SO SWEET ROOM BUT MEANT OR DISMAY AS A COMPASS TO NAVY TWENTY ONE FORTY SEVEN WHAT ESSENTIALLY WIPE THE SLATE CLEAN FOR THOSE WHO HAVE COMMITTED CRIMES OF VIOLENCE THAT RESULTED IN LENGTHY PRISON SENTENCES. IN THE BILL. WE ARE. WELL PRO. SO YOUR ELIGIBILITY IT APPEARS THE IN BASIC FROM ELLA FOR THE EXPUNGEMENT REAL FUNDED BILL WOULD BE THOSE CONVICTED AND SENT TO NINE CENTS IS OURS OR VIOLENT BECAUSE- MEANS THE CAN OF VIOLENT ASSAULTED CRIMES LIKE ROCK.

ELIGIBLE AND WHAT STATE TO THOSE WITH A BIG. RAIMES THAT IS FOR THE STATE IS CONCERNED THE CARD THEM FOR ALL ALL AND PURPOSES NEVER HAPPENED. WE BELIEVE SUCH RELIEF SHOULD BE LIMITED TO THOSE WHO RECEIVE LOCAL SENTENCES EITHER FELONY PROBATION OR ELEVEN SEVENTY EIGHT SENTENCES NOT STATE PRISON SENTENCES MOREOVER PRISON INMATES TO SUPPORT IT PARTICIPATING IN WILDLIFE PREVENTION AND CONTAINMENT ALREADY RECEIVED SIGNIFICANT AND IMPORTANT INCENTIVES AND BENEFITS SUCH AS TWO FOUR ONE CONTACT CREDITS.

AT A MINIMUM WE WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK THE AUTHOR TO CONSIDER AMENDING THE BILL TO LIMIT THE GIFT OF EXPUNGEMENT FOR A CRIME THAT RESULTED IN THE STATE PRISON SENTENCE. THE NON SERIOUS AND NON VIOLENT DRUG. WOULD BE HAPPY TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR TO CLEARLY DEFINE THOSE ELIGIBLE FOR THE BENEFITS OFFERED IN THIS BILL. CDA SUPPORTS REMOVING BARRIERS TO EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING FOR FELONS RE ENTERING OUR COMMUNITIES HOWEVER EXPLORE EXPOSING THE CONVICTIONS OF THOSE CONVICTED OF VIOLENT ASSAULT DESCRIBES.

AND SO I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WERE YEAR AND SUPPORT WANT TO ANSWER THIS BUT I GUESS SO MY FOR CLARIFICATION HAVING READ BOTH CURRENT EXPANSION LAW AND THIS IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THE REAL EXPANSION OF THIS IS THOSE FOLKS WHO ARE IS PROVIDING EXPANSION OPPORTUNITIES TO THOSE FOLKS THAT ARE AND IMPRISONED IN OUR STATE. FACILITIES RIGHT RIGHT YES AND I CAN I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE A PROFESSOR KATIE TEN TELL. THE ANSWER IS YES OKAY I'M HERE. PROFESSOR TENTO THIS. YES I THINK THE EXPANSION IS IN TWO KEY WAYS- THE MOST IMPORTANT IN MY MND IS THE TINY IN. MEANING THAT. INDIVIDUAL TO ACCEPT THE COMPLETE- FIRE CAN'T CAN PETITION FOR EXPUNGEMENT IMMEDIATELY UPON RELEASE FROM CUSTODY AS OPPOSED TO A WAITING PERIOD- AND THEN YES IT ALSO EXPANDS- THE EXPUNGEMENT RELIEF FOR THOSE INCARCERATED IN STATE PRISON WHO THEN DO FIRE CAMP FROM. PRESIDENT NOW DID YOU- AND I APOLOGIZE I WAS IN- ANOTHER. HEARING I AND I COULD SEE MAY HAVE ADDRESS THIS BUT THAT ANALYSIS TALKS ABOUT SORT OF THE VAGUENESS OF THE DEFINITION OF SUCCESSFUL PARTICIPATION. YEAH BUT HE- WE TALK A LITTLE ABOUT THAT WHAT THAT MEANS IT'S A LITTLE UNCLEAR TO ME AS WELL. THE PRESENT CDC ARE PROVIDES THE CERTIFICATES I THINK THAT. IT'S AN AREA THOUGH THE DOES NEED TO WILL NEED TO WORK WITH C. C. R. ADD TO THAT THE KEY. DOES WELL TO A PRIVATE PROPER CRITERIA. FOR THAT SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION I THINK THE ANALYSIS IS FAIR IN ASKING THAT THAT BE FAIR FURTHER CLARIFIED SO WE WILL ABSOLUTELY BE WORKING ON THAT. I THINK YOU SO I THINK I MEAN. I REALLY RESPECT WHAT. YOU'RE TRYING TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER **** AND I THINK THAT IT IS ALWAYS IMPORTANT FOR US TO GIVE OPPORTUNITY FOR RE INTEGRATION I THINK THAT'S WHAT EXPUNGEMENT THIS FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE SHOWN THAT THEY CAN. SUCCESSFULLY HE AND- THEN AND SUCCEED IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND I GUESS- MY CONCERN LIES THE IDEA THAT THESE. VIOLENT OF THERE IS WHO WILL. EAST AND THEN I'M LEVY TO GET X. WHAT ANY BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THIS WOULD PROVIDE IF ONE HAD DONE. AND SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED FIRE CAN'T WHILE INSIDE AND SO. ON IT REALLY IS THIS. VERY FOLKS CAN OUT AND SO. I THINK I. OFF TODAY FOR IT. THE OPPOSITION AND HOPEFULLY WE GET HOPE WHERE AND WE'RE GETTING THIS OP TO PEOPLE WHO I'M CAN TRULY THRIVE WHEN GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY SO I THINK IF. TO RESPOND. YOU CAN DO IT IN YOUR CLOSER IS ANY YES MISS KOREA. FIRST I WANT TO THANK BE- OUR COLLEAGUE FROM SENATOR NINO FOR INTRODUCING THIS BILL WHEN I WORKED. AUTHOR TO BILL LAST YEAR IS THAT PROVIDE PATHWAY FOR INCARCERATED OR FORMALLY INCARCERATED FIREFIGHTERS. TO HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY IN A PATHWAY FOR. EMPLOYMENT THROUGH THE CALIFORNIA CONSERVATION CORPS AND UNFORTUNATELY BECAUSE OF THE CURRENT SITUATION THAT WE'RE LIVING IN WITH COAL BED AND POTENTIAL FUNDS TO FUND THIS PROGRAM WE MAY HAVE TO BE LOOKING AT ALTERNATIVE- OPTIONS AS WE MOVE FORWARD EVEN THOUGH. THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF CURRENT CERTAINLY INVEST IN BE SKILLED TRAINED AND DEVELOPMENT ARE. FOLKS WORK SIDE OUR TRADITIONAL FIREFIGHTERS- FOR WHAT IS CONSIDERED THE NEW NORMAL IN CALIFORNIA WHICH IS THE WILD FIRE PREVENTION AND WE CERTAINLY NEED TO DO A LOT OF WORK AROUND THAT AT. THAT ARE GOVERNOR. CAN AND TO FIGURE. HOW WE DO THAT IN A LOT OF THAT IS CHEN SO IF WE AS A STATE AND THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS IS INVESTING IN THE TRAINING OF INDIVIDUALS TO- BECOME BECOME PART OF THE CAMP THE DOES THIS PART OF THE REQUIREMENTS IS THAT THEY ARE ACTUALLY AND NON VIOLENT. OFFENDERS A LOT OF THIS TO BE A WOMAN THAT THEY- DON'T HAVE THE SEVERE CRIMES IS ACTUALLY ISN'T. THE CONVERSATION BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO MEET A MINIMUM REQUIREMENT OF NON CRIMES. TO BE PART OF THE- PROGRAM TO BEGIN WITH WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS. BECAUSE THERE'S ALREADY A- EXTENSIVE LIST OF INDIVIDUALS THAT WANT TO BE A PART OF THIS PROGRAM AND SO THE REQUIREMENT TO JOHN. OR THE POLICY. ACTUALLY QUITE HIGH IN ADDITION TO THAT THE THIS PROGRAM SAVES THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ABOUT ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR- WITH- THE WORK THAT THEY DO WHICH PAYS VERY LITTLE AND THERE'S BEEN NATIONALLY. FIVE THESE FIRE. IN THIS PART CAMP GET PAID ABOUT I THINK IT WAS LIKE A DOLLAR FIFTY A DAY SOMETHING LIKE THAT- AND I THINK THAT WE NEED TO CONSIDER HOW WE USE THE INVESTMENT IN PEOPLE. AS A WAY TO PROVIDE OPPORTUNITY AND RESOURCES ONCE- FOLKS ARE OUT SO I THINK THE QUESTIONS THAT ARE- THAT HAVE ARISEN TO VALID IN TERMS OF. TRYING TO- CREATE LANGUAGE AND- ASSURANCE. THAT PEOPLE CAN BE SAFE I THINK AT THE END OF THE DAY THERE'S A LOT OF PUBLIC SAFETY- QUESTIONS THAT SHOULD BE ADDRESSED. BUT I THINK WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION AND I WANT TO APPLAUD. THE YOUNG AND- FERNANDO FROM BUTTE COUNTY HERE- REALLY GREAT THINGS ABOUT BUTTE COUNTY AND LOOK FORWARD TO VISIT ONE DAY BUT FOR THE WORK. HE'S DONE TO ENSURE THAT HE'S MOVING FORWARD AS A YOUNG MAN HE'S TWENTY YEARS OLD AND WAS ABLE TO ARTICULATE HIS PERSON. THIS IS THE STORIES ARE SO IMPORTANT WE HEAR THEM. BECAUSE IT'S A YOUNG MAN TWENTY YEARS OLD HAVING ALREADY BEEN PRESS SYSTEM AND FOUND ALL TURN INTO FOR HIS LIFE. AND NOW TRYING TO DO. SOMETHING GOOD AND- OF WELL YOU. HAVEN'T HIS COMMUNITY I THINK IT'S A- FOR US TO RECOGNIZE. AND ONE LAST THING I DO WANT TO GIVE A SHOUT OUT TO. A GOOD FRIEND OF MINE AND- SOMEBODY THAT. LEAD TO PROGRAM AT HOME V<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt;&lt;/c&gt;</u> INDUSTRIES AND MY COMMUNITY HECTOR. COOL MANY YEARS AGO. OFTEN THE SAME SITUATION AS A YOUNG MAN CAUGHT UP ON THE EAST SIDE OF LA THE DISTRICT THAT I NOW REPRESENT. HAVING GONE TO PRISON HAVING GONE TO ME. A FIREFIGHTER CAMP TRAINING AND HAD. ME PERSONALLY. WORKING OUT OF. YOUR THAT HE WOULD LOVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE BEEN ABLE TO CONTINUE TO DO THAT WORK. THE BECAUSE THESE LAWS WERE IN A PLACE THERE WASN'T ANYONE ADVOCATING FOR HIM AT THAT TIME. HE WILL BE ABLE. SO I'M GLAD THAT THERE IS- AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO THAT NOW AND TO ADDRESS SOME OF THESE ISSUES AND TO GIVE PEOPLE THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO GOOD WORK WHEN. THEY'RE OUT THANK YOU. THANK THE- YOUR QUESTION. YOU MAY CLOSE THANK YOU I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT EXPUNGEMENT SURVEIL BILL NOW. AND THOSE WITH FELONY CONVICTIONS ARE REQUIRED TO WAIT MUCH LONGER SO I COULD BE AS AS A PROFESSOR MAKE MENTION TO GIVE YOU SEVEN YEARS. THIS PROVIDES THAT OPPORTUNITY WE'RE LOOKING AT REHABILITATION IF DURING THEIR TIME IN PRISON THEY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO WORK THEY WERE SELECTED BECAUSE OF THEIR BEHAVIOR ALREADY. THEY WERE SELECTED BECAUSE OF THE THEY WERE IN. THE LOWEST CLASSIFICATION OF INMATES AS THE AS HAS BEEN NOTED. LOWER LEVEL- VIOENCE. NON VIOLENT CRIMES. THEY WERE SELECTED- BECAUSE OF THIS AND THAT DURING THEIR TIME WORKING ON THESE FIRE CREWS ARE UNDER SUPERVISION THE ENTIRE TIME AND THIS AT TIMES IS CONSIDERED PART OF THE REHABILITATION PROGRAM. AND WITH THAT I DO ASK THAT WE AS WE MOVE FORWARD- CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD THE PRACTICE OF REHABILITATION. THE TWENTY ONE FORTY SEVEN IS INSTILLING HOLE IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM GIVING INDIVIDUALS THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROPERLY INTEGRATE INTO SOCIETY AND ALLOWING THEM TO GET THE SIX FUNDS MEANT ON AN EXPEDITED BASIS RATHER THAN WAITING THAT. FOR SEVEN YEARS. RESPECT ASK FOR YOUR I'VE- THANK YOU INTO I CHAIR. SOME OF THE COULD OF THE CALIFORNIA AGREE SIR THIRTY SOCIAIS AND I. A LOT OF IT WOULD GO THE WAY SO IF WE TALK TO CDC ARE AND AT WHAT ARE REQUIRE FOR YOU THE BEING. IN THIS I THINK YOU WERE I THINK THE PUBLIC. AND EVEN THE DA OFFICE WILL GET SOME COMFORT KNOWING THAT IT'S A HIGH. THEY JUST DON'T TAKE ANY AND IN THAT WAY REALLY DO INTO THAT. SO THAT YOU SEE THAT IS THE BEST OF THE BEST BETTER IN CDC Y. TWO LET'S LOOK AT THE CRIMES INVOLVED AND IF THERE'S A WAY TO A- IT TO GIVE SOME KIND OF. FEELING THAT WE'RE MOVING IN DOWN MOVE YOUR RIGHT DIRECTION. WE DON'T HAVE WE DON'T ALL DON'T HAVE A MISTAKE BECAUSE I AS YOU KNOW. ALL IT TAKES JUST ONE PER GOING TO THIS TO SET A BACK. TEN TWENTY YEARS SO. WE DO HAVE TO MAKE. THE ROOM. AS AS WE CANCER ONE PEOPLE OF BACK AT WHAT WE'VE DONE. OF WHO WE ALLOWED. DON'T KNOW THE WE MADE IT. THE MOST DIFFICULT NO STRANGE PROCESS DECK COULD BE AND THE SUCCESS RATE IS UNBELIEVABLY HIGH AND IF SOME DOES. NOT TO MEET THOSE. THERE THERE YOU IT'S NOT. IT'S AN ABERRATION AND SO I I'M WE TO WORK WITH YOU LES MORSE AND- DISTRICT ATTORNEYS. TO MAYBE TRY TO FOR A SWEET SPOT AND HOPEFULLY MISTER MOORE SO ALSO WILL UP TO MEET WITH THE- ZOOM WHATEVER BUT THE NEW THE NEW NORMAL OF I'M WILLING TO WORK YOU AS WE MOVE THIS CAN BE. AND BEFORE IT GETS. TO THE FLOOR AND WORK FOR YOU BEFORE IT GETS A DISCLOSE APPROACH WITH GETS TO A THAT. WE'VE READ REFINED IT. IF THE IN AND I THINK ONCE WE START THERE AND MAYBE EVEN ADD SOME MORE REQUIREMENTS WORKING WITH CDC ARE. WE MAY BE ABLE TO SCORE ABOUT. SOME FOLKS THERE REALLY SHOULD BE.

CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION YOUR- THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS LEARN MORE SOMEBODY HAVE TO CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION WE ARE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSED TO AB TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE AS CURRENTLY DRAFTED CDA HAS NO OBJECTION TO THE GENERAL INTENT OF THIS BILL TO PROGRAM THE RELEASE OF INFORMATION CONCERNING A MINOR WHO HAS PARTICIPATED IN- COMPLETED A DIVERSION PROGRAM. IN FACT WE ARE. HOWEVER WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT LANGUAGE IN THE BILL THAT WOULD APPEAR TO PREVENT LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES AND PROSECUTORIAL AGENCIES FROM EVER DISCLOSING THE SYSTEMS. OF UNDERLYING INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THOSE REPORTS WHICH MAY BE CONSIDERED BRADY MATERIAL PURSUANT TO THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT CASE BRADY VERSUS MERRILL. THE BRADY CASE AS YOU WELL KNOW IMPOSES A DUTY UPON LAW ENFORCEMENT. AND PROSECUTORIAL AGENCIES TO DISCLOSE INFORMATION WHICH THEY PUT OUT THAT SHOWS A PERSON BEHAVES IN WAYS WHICH MAY REFLECT UPON HIS OR HER. CREDIBILITY IF THEY BECOME WITNESSES AND A LITTLE PROSECUTION. THE DUTIES OF LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES AND PROP HEATERS UNDER BRADY. CONSTITUTIONALLY IMPOSED AND CANNOT BE ABROGATED BY STATE. WE BEAT SURPRISED TO HEAR ATTORNEY ORGANIZATIONS REPRESENTING THE DEFENSE FARMS SUPPORT THE BILL AS DRAFTED GIVEN THE IMPEDIMENT IT WOULD CREATE TO D. A.'S IN COMPLYING WITH THEIR BRADY OBLIGATIONS. THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS NOTES THE BRADY CONCERNED PRESENTED IN THIS BILL AND WE ARE HOPING THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER STONE WOULD CONSIDER AN AMENDMENT. IN ORDER TO MEET OUR OLD BRADY OBLIGATIONS WITHOUT SUCH AN AMENDMENT WE HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO OPPOSE THIS BILL IN ORDER TO PROTECT A CRIMINAL DEFENDANT'S RIGHT TO A FAIR TRIAL. AND TO SHIELD CALIFORNIA PROSECUTORS FROM LEGAL AND ETHICAL CONSEQUENCES THAT WOULD FLOW FROM FAILING TO PROVIDE BRADY MATERIAL IN A CRIMINAL PROSECUTION. WE HOPE THIS AMENDMENT IS ADOPTED SO WE MAY REMOVE OUR OPPOSITION UNTIL THAT PLAY TAKES PLACE HOWEVER WE MUST ASK FOR A NOTEBOOK THANK YOU. THANK YOU ARE THERE ANY OTHER IN OPPOSITION MISTER MODERATOR OPEN UP THE LINE FOR A- NAME AN ORGANIZATION. NINE THREE NINE THREE CLASS PLACE. I'M SORRY I WAS NOT IN OPPOSITION OUT THERE WAS FROM THE PEOPLE IN THE MODEL COULD NOT OPEN PRODUCT MANAGER THE PUBLIC THE BALL FROM THE LIKE THE BELL THAT'S THE THAT. YOUNG OF AN BACK.

HI THERE MY GAS WHICH YOU FOR I COULDN'T MAKE THE LINE BUT WE ARE SUPPORT OF TWO FOUR TO FIVE THANK YOU. AND NOTHING LIKE YOU. OKAY THANK YOU BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE FOR COMMENTS OR. QUESTION JUST A QUICK ONE. I JUST WANT TO FOR UP ON A THREE THAT WERE MADE WITH WITH TO THE BRADY VERSUS MARYLAND CONCERNS BY THE DA'S OFFICE DO YOU HAVE ANY THEN YOU'D LIKE THAT YEAH ABSOLUTELY IT IN A LOT OF FEELING STUFF THAT WE'VE DONE DEALS WITH BRADY MATERIALS WERE WERE HAPPY TO TALK ABOUT BRADY MATERIAL WHAT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THOUGH IS THAT. IF WE'RE PUTTING IN. LANGUAGE AROUND ALLOWING BRADY MATERIALTHAT IT'S NOT SO BROAD THAT IT UNDERMINES. THE INTENT OF WHAT THE- SO YEAH WERE. FORCES BEING DRAMATIC WERE WORKING WITH HIM AND TRY TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT. THAT WE DO IT IN A WAY THAT IS PRODUCTIVE DOESN'T UNDERMINE THIS BUT DEALS WITH THE SUPREME COURT CASE ABSOLUTELY. THANK YOU ARE THERE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. OKAY THANK YOU. YOU MAY CLOSE I THANK YOU I. ASK YOUR EYE BUT IT'S INTERESTING THAT SOME OPPOSITE BROUGHT UP THE ISSUE OF COST WHEN ULTIMATELY WHEN WE DO AUTOMATIC CEILING LIKE THIS IT'S LESS EXPENSIVE BECAUSE IT DOESN'T INVOLVE A- HAVING TO GO TO COURT TO GET A- BIRD SEALED. AND WE'RE CERTAINLY WILL FUTURE COUNCIL AND OTHERS ON THAT THE TIMING AND THE COST AND ALL OF GETTING THIS DONE SO THAT'S THAT'S REALLY A MINOR ISSUE AND I FRANKLY HAVE. BEFORE THE KIDS TAX THAT. THE WHO ARE GOING TO HAVE TO DO GET ANOTHER FORM I THINK OUR SYSTEM CAN HANDLE. ANOTHER FORM AND AS RESPECT. ABOUT JAKE AND I KNOW I WILL- PROBABLY. FOLLOW UP WITH YOU. ON THE BUT JUST BECAUSE WE DO DO IT TO MAKE SURE. THAT IT CAN BE DONE IN THAT IT UP FULL ABSOLUTELY. I DO UNDERSTAND THAT AND THEN THE LAWYER THING YOU'RE IN. DELEGATES CAN WILL SORT THAT OUT THE X. I HAVE ONE LAWYER YELLING CONSTITUTIONAL SOME. YEARS I GOT ANOTHER LAWYER HERE THEN I GOT YOU SO. WHEN YOU BETWEEN THREE LAWYERS YOU JUST. PUT THEM IN A CORNER AND LET HIM FIGHT IT OUT AND SO- I THINK. YOU IN. YOU AND- LARRY MORSE WILL BE FULLY CAPABLE OF BEING ABLE TO. FIGURE THIS OUT. TOGETHER I THINK SO YES.

WITH INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES SINCE SEVEN STATES ATTACHED WITH THE TOP TWO SPOTS REALLY DETERMINE. WHO IS ACTUALLY DISABLED FOR THE PURPOSES OF HOLDING THE CONSTITUTION THE CARD THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE ACTED. AND IN TWO THOUSAND AND THREE TO DO JUST THAT BUT OVER SEVENTEEN YEARS THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY HAS MADE VAST ADVANCES IN THE STUDY OF INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES AND THE SCIENCE OF BRAIN DEVELOPMENT. THIS BILL DOES IS BRING FORWARD. THAT SCIENCE INTO THIS DISCUSSION OF WHO HAS INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES. DISABILITIES CURRENTLY OF THIS. THERE ARE PARKS WE SEVEN HUNDRED THIRTY PEOPLE WAITING ON DEATH ROW MANY OF WHOM MAY BE INTELLECTUALLY BOTH ACCORDING THE CITY'S CLINICAL STANDARDS AND THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT WE- AND IGNORE. SO BUILT UP IT REQUIRES. THE CALIFORNIA THE PROGRESS AND USE THE STANDARD IN THE DIAGNOSTIC AND STATISTICAL MANUAL OF MENTAL DISORDERS DSM I'VE WHICH IS THE CURRENT STANDARD THIS BRINGS IT UP THAT STANDARD AND IN ADDITION THIS IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF THIS THAT AB TWENTY FIVE TWELVE. WITH PROSECUTE. FOR A PERSON OTHER IQ SCORE LOW. FOR A THEIR I. Q. SCORE ADJUSTED UPWARDS BECAUSE OF THEIR RACE OR SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS WE KNOW THAT IQ TESTS ARE BIASED AGAINST BLACK AND LATINO PEOPLE. AND THAT THEY I WOULD AND THAT MAKES THEM WELL FOR EXECUTION WITH A- AND A SCORE THAT IS REALLY IN THE INTELLECTUALLY DISABLED CATEGORY BUT BECAUSE OF THAT ARGUMENT YOU GET REYES AND THEN THEY'RE NOT ELIGIBLE THIS IS BLATANT RACES. THAT DEVELOPED. THE IT GENERAL IS NOT USING THAT STANDARD ANYMORE THERE ARE SOME PROSECUTORS IN SOME COUNTIES THAT STILL ARE THIS WOULD. MAKE THIS CONSISTENT ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND PROHIBIT ITS USE THIS IS AN IMPORTANT BILL MOVING FORWARD I KNOW THAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE A MORATORIUM OUR GOVERNOR TO THE VERY STANCE MORE TORRENT AT THE DEATH PENALTY BUT HOWEVER WE STILL HAVE A DEATH ROW. THERE ARE MANY ON DEATH ROW. NOT BE DESERVE NOT TO BE THERE BECAUSE OF THE THEIR INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES.

ABILITY TO. IN COMPLIANCE- WITH UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT LAW. IN TWO THOUSAND THREE ARE LEGISLATURE PASSED SB THREE ADDING SECTION THIRTEEN SEVENTY SIX TO THE PENAL CODE AND CODIFYING ATKINS VERSUS VIRGINIA. SINCE THEN THE US SUPREME COURT HAS REPEATEDLY CLARIFIED AND EXPANDED UPON THEIR HOLDING AN ATKINS STRESSING OVER AND OVER THAT STATES MUST LOOK TO THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY TO DEFINE INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY. IT'LL CODE SECTION THIRTEEN SEVENTY pSIX IN CONTRAST HAS BEEN UPDATED ONLY ONE. CHANGE THE TERM MENTALLY RETARDED TO INTELLECTUALLY DISABLED. AB TWENTY FIVE TWELVE BRINGS THE STATUTE IN LINE WITH US SUPREME COURT CASE LAW AND CURRENT CLINICAL STANDARDS AND IT ADDRESSES ISSUES THAT THE COURTS AND LITIGANTS HAVE ENCOUNTERED AND I CAN HEARINGS OVER THE PAST EIGHTEEN YEARS. EVERY CHANGE TO SECTION THIRTEEN SEVENTY SIX PROPOSED HERE IS ALIGNED WITH THE AMERICAN PSYCHIATRIC ASSOCIATION DSM FIVE AND THE PUBLICATIONS OF THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION ON INTELLECTUAL AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. FIRST AS A SCIENTIFIC MATTER BEYOND THE EIGHTEENTH BIRTHDAY THE DSM FIVE HAS DROPPED. OUT UP OR INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY AND FIND A COLLECTION.

AS EXPLAINED THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS THE BILL OF. ON SECOND BECAUSE FOR MEDICAL DIAGNOSES AND HABEAS PROCEEDING. THIRD AB TWENTY FIVE TWELVE ADDRESSES A LACK OF ACCESS TO EXPERT WITNESSES IN SOME CASES. SOME CASES HAVE PROCEEDED THROUGH A FIRST ROUND OF THINK THEY POST CONVICTION WITH REVIEW WITHOUT FUNDING FOR AN ACTION DIRECTOR. WHEN THESE CASES BLOOM BONTA FEDERAL COURT AND A PAIN FUNDING FOR AN EXPERT THERE THEY THEN RETURNED TO STATE COURT FOUR YEARS OF ADDITIONAL LITIGATION. BY CREATING AN ALTERNATE WAY TO MAKE A PAYMENT AFTER SHOWING BILL WILL HELP CALIFORNIA COURT BETTER IDENTIFY THOSE FACING EXECUTION WHO MAY BE INTELLECTUALLY DISABLED. THERE IS NO DISADVANTAGE TO THE STATE HERE THE SENATE OR PETITIONER STILL HAS THE BURDEN OF PROOF BUT A HEARING. AND THE FACT FINDERS DECISION ABOUT WHETHER A PERSON IS INTELLECTUALLY DISABLED. ALWAYS BE BASED ON THE EVIDENCE THE PARTIES PRESENT AT THE HEARING. FINALLY TO WORK IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM IS TO KNOW THAT RACISM IN FACT THAT. WHAT WE HAVE SEEN ACTION DOES THAT RATE PLAGUE THOSE HEARINGS AS WELL. HE ATE AND THE ATTORNEY GENERAL HAVE ARGUED IN ASPEN THAT PEOPLE OF COLOR FOR THOSE WHO GROW UP WITH LOW SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS. A CIRCUMSTANCE DISPROPORTIONATELY EXPERIENCE IN THE COUNTRY BY PEOPLE OF COLOR SHOULD HAVE THEIR IQ SCORES ADJUSTED UPWARD BECAUSE THE TAP WHAT MADE FOR THEM. IT HAD NO GROUNDING IN AND IS IN FACT CONTRARY TO THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY STANDARDS FOR EVALUATING INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY. ARTIFICIALLY INFLATING A PERSON OF COLOR THANK YOU SO THAT WE CAN EXECUTE THEM IS ANTITHETICAL TO THE STATE'S IDEALS AND TO THE CONSTITUTION. INTELLECTUALLY DISABLED PEOPLE IN THE AGGREGATE DATA SPECIAL RISK OF WRONGFUL EXECUTIONS AB TWENTY FIVE TWELVE WILL BRING CALIFORNIA LAW INTO ALIGNMENT WITH US SUPREME COURT PRECEDENT AND ENSURE THAT THE STATE IDENTIFIES AND PREVENTS THE EXECUTION OF INTELLECTUALLY DISABLED ADULTS.

MARCO GEORGE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION AND STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU THANK YOU. THE MORE EQ YOU MAY CONTINUE. NOW NOW OPPOSITION I HAVE AGILE BACKERS SODOMY A WITNESS ON THE PART OF. MODERATOR YOU MAY BEGIN. PRESIDENTIAL CAN YOU HEAR ME YES SORRY FOR THE CONFUSION. ALL RIGHT THIS IS ANGELA BACKERS I'M A CO CHAIR OF THE CAPITALIZATION COMMITTEE FOR CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION I HAVE BEEN A PROSECUTOR FOR THIRTY SIX YEARS RECENTLY RETIRED. AND I- AND THE CHAIR OR CO CHAIR OF THE COMMITTEE. THAT SETS ON THE CAPITAL ALLOCATION- ISSUES IN THE STATE AND YOU WERE JUST COLDS AND THINGS THAT WERE NOT TRUE. AND WE- ARE ASKING FOR YOUR DIRECT OPPOSITION TO THE BILL FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS YOUR GOVERNMENT WE ARE GOVERNED BY THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT IN ATKINS VERSUS VIRGINIA. IT IS A TWO THOUSAND TWO UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT CASE. OF FIVE THIRTY SIX U. S. THREE OH FOUR THAT IS THE LAW OF THE LAND AND IT IS- INAPPROPRIATE FOR CALIFORNIA TO TRY TO OVERTURN. THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT THAT GIVES EVERY BENEFIT TO THE CAPITAL DEFENDANT WHO IS CLAIMING AN INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY. I THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY THANK YOU TO YOU TODAY I HAVE A FEW THINGS I WOULD LIKE TO SAY TO YOU. AS A WITNESS ON THIS CASE- THE- REQUIREMENT IN COURT TO PROVE AN INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY IS THAT YOU HAVE AND IT SHOULD BE THAT SHOULD BE THE REQUIREMENT THAT YOU HAVE AN EXPERT PSYCHOLOGIST WHO IS. AN EXPERT IN THE AREA OF ASSESSMENT TESTING AND ADAPTIVE FUNCTIONING THERE IS NO WHERE THAT THAT IS MENTIONED IN THIS- PROPOSED BILL. IT IS ALSO- VAGUE UNCONSTITUTIONAL AND UNDER JEFF TO MURDER VICTIMS AND THEIR FAMILIES. BECAUSE NOW WERE THEY WANT TO HAVE THIS BILL THAT SAYS- WELL YOU KNOW WHAT. EVEN THOUGH THE AND HIGHER PSYCHOLOGICAL COMMUNITY BELIEVES THAT IF YOU HAVE AN INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY IT IS CLEAR AND UNAMBIGUOUS AND MANIFESTS ITSELF BEFORE THE AGE OF EIGHTEEN. NOW THE BILL WANTS TO HAVE A VAGUE UNCONSTITUTIONAL AND UNDER A- DEFINITION OR LACK OF DEFINITION I SHOULD SAY VAGUE BUT SAID. WELL WE'RE GONNA SAY IT MAYBE TO MANIFEST ITSELF BEFORE THE END OF THE DEVELOPMENTAL FAN. PERIOD THE DEVELOPMENTAL PERIOD IS NOT DEFINE SO YOU COULD HAVE A HIRED GUN SOMEONE IS PAID TO SAY THAT THIS PERSON IS INTELLECTUALLY DISABLED WE'LL TALK ABOUT. AT WHAT STAGE OF THE PROCEEDINGS IN A MINUTE. BUT THAT A HIRED EXPERT COMES INTO FOR THE DEFENSE AND SAYS WELL DURING HIS DEVELOPMENTAL PERIOD AT AGE TWENTY NINE. IT APPEARS TO ME THAT HE IS INTELLECTUALLY DISABLED WHEN THAT IS CONTRARY TO ALL. I LOGICAL READ. SANDERS ARE YOU HAVE THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT GUY THE- YOU HAVE THE CLINICAL CYCLE A- TESTING AND ADAPTIVE FUNCTIONING THAT GUIDE THE- AND NOW YOU HAVE THIS PROPOSED BILL THAT SAYS THE FOLLOWING. IT NO LONGER REQUIRES A SPECIFIC DEFINITION OF INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY IT CAN BE WHATEVER YOU'RE PAID THAT. IT NO LONGER REQUIRES A DEVELOPMENTAL PERIOD IT'S NOT EVEN DEFINE IT JUST SAYS AT ANY TIME BEFORE THE END OF THE DEVELOPMENTAL PERIOD WHEN THEY- THE VAST MAJORITY OF RESPECTED PSYCHOLOGISTS. SAY THAT WE ALL KNOW IF SOMEBODY'S INTELLECTUALLY DISABLED BEFORE THEY TURN EIGHTEEN BUTTHIS NEW LANGUAGE THAT IN HERE COULD YOU COULD COME IN AND SAY WHAT WHEN HE TURNED THIRTY I NOTICED THERE WASN'T SOMETHING QUITE RIGHT. SO IT'S COMPLETELY UNDER FINE. AND THEN IT'S- JEFF BECAUSE IT JUST REQUIRES A SINGLE CONNECTION TO COME IN AND DAY WELL I NOTICED FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME IN HIS TWENTIES OR THIRTIES. THAT THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN SOMETHING THAT WASN'T QUITE RIGHT. THAT IS NOT CONSISTENT WITH THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT AND IT'S NOT CONSISTENT WITH THE- WELL RESPECTED CLINICAL- LAW CLINICAL I SHOULD AY. THE TESTING THAT IS DONE AND THIS- STATE A VERY WELL RESPECTED TESTING. AND THEN THEY- THING THAT WAS JUST BROUGHT UP IN ABOUT A THAT WAS COMMENTED ABOUT HABEAS IS OUTRAGEOUS BECAUSE YOU'RE DEPRIVE THE VICTIMS. AND THE VICTIMS' FAMILY AND THEIR LOVED ONES FROM BEING PART OF ANY PROCEEDING. SO WHAT THEY'RE BUILT WHAT THE SENATE THE VERY END. THAT NOT IN PRE TRIAL PROCEEDING NOT DURING THE PRELIMINARY HEARING NOT DURING THE JURY TRIAL NOT DURING THE SENTENCING HEARING BUT TWENTY YEARS LATER I'M GONNA BRING SOMEONE AND DURING THE STATE HABEAS. FOR A FEDERAL HABEAS AND ALL THE SUDDEN FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME I AM GOING TO SAY OH YOU KNOW WHAT THIS PERSON'S INTELLECTUALLY DISPLAY DISABLED AND I. PAID A GUY TO COME IN AND SET IT TO A LATER IT. IT WOULD THE VICTIM. AND BRING IT UP TO THE VERY FIRST TIME IN A HABEAS PROCEEDING AFTER THERE'S BEEN A CONVICTION BY A JURY TRIAL SO WE ARE ASKING YOU FOR ALL OF THESE REASONS TO STRENUOUSLY OPPOSE WELL. Q. ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESS IS AN OPPOSITION NAME AND ORGANIZATION. NO ONE IS THANK YOU ALL RIGHT NOW. ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. DECEMBER MR LACKEY HAS A QUESTION. YEAH I REALLY HAVE TROUBLE WITH THE AMBIGUITY PIECE ON THE DEFINITION I THINK IT'S FAIR NO ONE WANTS TO. HOLD SOMEBODY ACCOUNT HAS A TRUE ELECTION DISABILITY. BUT I'M REALLY WORRIED ABOUT HOW MUCH COULD BE INTERPRETED BY THE COURTS ARE NO WE JUST HEARD A- VERY- POWERFUL. DESCRIPTION OF OPPOSITION. WHEN SHE PRESENTED ATKINS VERSUS VIRGINIA I DON'T NOT FAMILIAR WITH WHAT THOSE PER CAR. BUT THE CLEARLY THERE SEEMS TO BE. THE MEMBER UNION WHAT WHAT THIS MEANS ACT AND AN OFFER GOES TO BE TO BROUGHT I THINK WE DEFEAT WHAT THE ATTENTION AS INTENTIONAL- HAS A REAL. DISABILITY A RECORD USING ACCOUNTABILITY. AND RIGHT FROM TIMES OF AND I THINK THAT NOT. TO SEE ANYWHERE. PUT TO THAT HAS A THAT DIFFICULTY MAKING THOSE DETERMINATIONS. HOWEVER THERE'S IF THE IF IT GOES BEYOND ITS INTENTION THEN IT BECOMES A DISSERVICE AND BECOMES QUESTIONABLE AS FAR AS IT ARRIVING AT JUSTICES SO I'D LIKE TO HEAR WHAT ADDRESS ABSOLUTELY CERTAINTY ON THAT ISSUE YEAH IT'S A IT'S A LITTLE ASTONISHING TO HEAR THAT TESTIMONY BECAUSE THIS IS NOT A DOING ATKINS THIS IS BASED ON ATKINS AMERICANS DECISION. AND WHAT THE SUPREME COURT HAS SAID IS THAT THE STATE'S NEED TO KEEP UP WITH THE DEBT THAT SORT OF DEFINITION THAT CLINICAL CLINICAL DEFINITION OF INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE DOING SO WE RELY ON THE CALIFORNIA STATUTE SAID BEEN EXISTENCE FOR DECADES. CLINICAL STANDARDS HAVE CHANGED THAT'S WHY WORKING THIS TO THE CURRENT STANDARD WHICH IS THE DSM FIVE. SO THAT'S ACTUALLY VERY CLEAR NOW THE DEVELOPMENTAL PERIOD. IS UP TO AGE TWENTY FIVE IT'S THIS COMMITTEE HAS SEEN AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN WE TALK ABOUT. THE ABOUT BRAIN DEVELOPMENT. DOESN'T ADDED EIGHTEEN THAT'S COOL THINKING AND THAT'S SPENT OUTMODED FOR YEARS SO WE'RE BRINGING IN LINE. THIS WHOLE LINE OF THINKING IN THIS WHOLE POLICY TO WORK CURRENT. MENTAL HEALTH STANDARDS ARE AND THE CURRENT DIAGNOSTIC AND CLINICAL MANUAL THAT'S WHAT IT S IT'S NOT A BIG YOU ITS NOT UNCLEAR. WE'RE PUTTING CLARITY HERE BECAUSE WE'RE USING THE SAME STANDARDS THAT WE USE IN THE DIVERSION STATUE FOR EXAMPLE OF WHEN WE'RE DECIDING WORK WHEN IT WHEN IT SOMEBODY IS. IT WILL BE DIVERTED AS A AS A JUVENILE. UP TO TWENTY FIVE IF IT'S CLEAR THAN WITH SOMEBODY THAT HAS AUTISM FALL UNDER THIS DECLARATION. EIGHT YOU GET HAVE TO GO TO THE MANUAL I'M NOT A CLINICIAN. SO THE DSM FIVE THE CURRENT MANUAL FOR WHAT TO FIND INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY. CURRENT STATUTE RELIES ON THAT pIS BRINGING UP TO CURRENT STANDARDS THE CURRENT CLINICAL AND DIAGNOSTIC MANUAL. THAT'S WHAT THIS IS DOING AND THAT AND THAT'S WHAT I MEAN THAT TESTIMONY WAS EMOTIONAL. MATTERS MONEY CLEARLY DON'T LIKE THIS BILL BUT THAT'S REALLY NOT WHAT THIS BILL IS THIS BILL IS. WE BEGIN THIS PROCESS STRONGER AND BETTER AND BRINGING CALIFORNIA. TO USING CURRENT. MEDICAL SCIENCE. IN THE AREAS OF INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES SO IT IT'S NOT MAKING IT IT'S NOT BIG. IT'S NOT MAKING IT MORE DIFFICULT IT'S ACTUALLY PROVIDING A LOT OF CLARITY BASED ON CURRENT SITES THAT'S WHAT THAT'S ALL THIS BILL DOES IS IT TAKES THIS THAT STANDARD. HELLO FROM THE QUILL STANDARD AND BRINGS IT UP TO CURRENT CLINICAL STANDARDS. THAT'S WHAT GOT. THANK YOU ANY OTHER QUESTIONS COM YOU MAY CLOSE. A THIRD OF ASPIRO. BUT IT IT IT. OBVIOUSLY THE WITNESSES ARE BOTH SIDES ARE VERY PASSIONATE ABOUT THIS AND I HOPE. FOR THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF IT THAT THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE DO A BILL. IT GOES TO OUR- JUDICIAL COUNCIL WOULD NEXT WANTED THINGS THAT THEY LOOK FOR. AS FAR AS APPROVING ARE SITTING THROUGH A BILL SO. WE DO HAVE SOME LAWYERS ACTUALLY LOOKING AT THAT NIGHT AND I THINK. ALL OF THAT WAS TAKEN IN CONSIDERATION BEFORE WE EVEN GOT YEAH YEAH WE'RE WE'RE NOT CHANGING THE UNDERLYING CAUSES THEATER I'M JUST. YEAH OKAY THANK YOU DON'T TALK PASSED YES OKAY SO- I KNOW YOU'RE NOT CHANGD I NOW THE WITNESS IN OPPOSITION IS SAYING YOU YOU ARE I'M JUST SAYING IS A THIRD PARTY INDEPENDENT GROUP THAT LOOKS AT THIS DID NOT FIND THAT IS WHAT WOULD HAVE SEC CORRECT. AND THEY'RE THERE TO MAKE SURE WE DON'T MAKE THOSE MISTAKES. WE DON'T- TRAMPLE OVER THE CONSTITUTION THEY'RE THEY'RE JUST WITH THE THEREFORE. AND SO- THE INTELLECTUAL STANDARDS OF FROM WHEN WE WERE YOUNG AND GOING TO PUBLIC SCHOOLS OBVIOUSLY IT'S CHANGED QUITE A BIT TO NOW. AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES OF THEIR A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT FELL THROUGH THE CRACKS. THAT MADE IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH SOME DISABILITIES BUT THEY WORK FOR WHATEVER REASON. FUNDING AND OTHER THINGS AND SO- WORKER ALL OF TO DO THAT AND SO BRINGING THESE THINGS UP TO PRESENT DAY STANDARDS- I THINK IS REALLY IMPORTANT IT'S BEST. TO TAKE. YOU GO AHEAD AND IN SOMEONE'S LIFE.

A SOLUTION WORKING A CCP AWAY AND THE PAROLE OFFICERS ASSOCIATION I WOULD THINK THIS IS A SMART REFORM THOUGHT ABOUT RELEASING INDIVIDUALS BACK THE COMMUNES ABOUT INSURING THEIR SUCCESS THIS FOCUSES ON IMPROVING. BEST PRACTICE IS TO- FOCUS ON SUCCESS NOT A PUNISHMENT AND- WITH THAT ASK YOUR AYE VOTE THIS AFTERNOON. THANK YOU AND YOU HAVE TO IT THIS IS TODD HOFFMAN SENIOR PUBLIC SAFETY CONSULTANT FOR THE CALIFORNIA FOR JUST SAFETY AND JUSTICE AND NIKKI MARTINUS SISTER WARRIORS FREEDOM COALITION.

GOOD AFTERNOON ASSEMBLY MEMBER JONES SAWYER AND THE MEMBERS OF THE ASSEMBLY PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE MY NAME IS NIKKI MARTINEZ AND I'M AN ACTIVIST WITH HISTORIANS FREEDOM COALITION BASED CAMPAIGN GAVE ON MARCH FOURTEENTH TWO THOUSAND AND NINETEEN I RETURNED HOME AFTER SERVING TWENTY FIVE YEARS THE CALIFORNIA PRISON SYSTEM. I CAME BACK TO MY FAMILY AND FRIENDS COMPLETELY DEDICATED TO GIVING BACK AND GETTING INVOLVED WITH MY COMMUNITY AND BEING A ROLE MODEL DURING MY INCARCERATION I SPEND A LOT OF TIME AND SEAT BELT IN DEEP DEEP REFLECTION WHICH TO ME RECEIVING MY ASSOCIATES DEGREE COMPLETING AND FACILITATING NUMEROUS SELF HELP COURSES AND TO BE ABLE TO RUN TO PRESENT PROGRAMS. IF CHANGES IN ACHIEVEMENT LATE THE FOUNDATION FOR ME TO GO BEFORE THE CALIFORNIA PAROLE BOARD TO BOULDER OPAL DISCUSSED HOW IT WOULD NO LONGER THE PERSON I WAS. TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO A CHANGE WHICH WAS SEEN BY BOTH THE BOARD AND THE GOVERNOR WHO GRANTED ME SUITABILITY TO COME HOME. TODAY I WORK WITH THREE ORGANIZATIONS ALL OF WHICH I AM VERY PASSIONATE ABOUT. ONE AS A MENTOR FOR THE YOUTH IN THE JUVENILE HALL WITH THE RESILIENCE PROGRAM AT SAN DIEGO. THE SECOND AT THE SAN DIEGO CHAPTER LEADER FOR THE SISTER WERE YOUR FREEDOM COALITION. AND THE THIRD AT THE TEACHING ARTIST AT THE OLD GLOBE THEATRE A POSITION THAT IS CLOSE TO MY HEART AS IT IS A WAY OF ME MAKE YOU DIE RECHTE DEMANDS AND HONORING THE VICTIMS OF MY CRIME. I AM CURRENTLY A LIFETIME ALL IN MY FIRST YEAR AT BASS NEEDLEWORK SO BLOCKS THAT HAVE MY READING. CHALLENGE THE BIGGEST ONE IS HOW THE SIX PLACES RESTRICTIONS AND LIMITATIONS FOR PEOPLE ON A ROLE IN A UNIFORM WAY THAT DOES NOT ALLOW FOR MUCH FLEXIBILITY. FOR EXAMPLE THE TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS THAT LIMIT HOW FAR I CAN MOVE ABOUT MY COUNTY MAKES IT HARD. TO PARTICIPATE FULLY IN WORKING EVENTS AND TO SEE MY FAMILY WE STILL HAVE TO TRAVEL TO VISIT ME AS. IF I WAS STILL INCARCERATED. WHILE I. THE OF THE WORLD'S AS WHO COME WITH THE- PLANTS ON HOW I WANT TO LIVE. IT CAN BE VERY DE MOTIVATING WHEN I INDICATED BY A SYSTEM THAT SHOULD BE HELPING ME TO SUCCEED. IN ADDITION TO MY JOB I AM CURRENTLY A STUDENT AT THE SAN DIEGO CITY COLLEGE. WHERE I'M WRAPPING UP A FEW UNIT SO THAT I CAN TRANSFER TO A COLLEGE WHERE I HOPE TO. BE EIGHT IN SOCIAL IN JUVENILE JUSTICE. AB TWENTY THREE FORTY TWO WILL HELP MAKE MY EDUCATION MORE MEANINGFUL AS ONE OF THE PROVISIONS CREATE A PROGRAM FOR PAROLE THESE CAN ACTUALLY EARN CREDITS TO REDUCE THEIR PERIOD A POOL BY SUCCESSFULLY. COMPLETING EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS. I WILL BE ABLE TO CONTINUE MY EDUCATIONAL JOURNEY WHILE ALSO WORKING TOWARD THE SHORTER PELO PERIOD. CASTING AB TWENTY THREE FORTY TWO WILL SET OUT ON A PATH. TO NOT ONLY GIVE BACK TO MY COMMUNITY AND ACTUALLY BUT CHEST SIX ACTUALLY RE INTEGRATE BACK INTO SOCIETY. IT WOULDHELP WITH PRACTICAL SITUATIONS LIKE BEING ABLE TO JUST RENTS AN APARTMENT AND BEING ABLE TO TRAVEL FREELY FOR WORK SO I CAN FULLY PARTICIPATE WITHOUT HAVING TO WONDER. IF I'LL BE ABLE TO ATTEND TO WORKING EVENT A TRAINING A MEETING BECAUSE IT'S OUTSIDE OF MY TRAVEL RADIUS. I FEEL AS THOUGH I AM PROHIBITED FROM BEING THE BEST VERSION OF MYSELF. BECAUSE ALTHOUGH I'VE DONE MUCH INTERNAL SELF REFLECTION IN WORK. I'M STILL RESTRICTED BY THE LIMITATIONS PLACED ON THE PART BY TWO ALL. I ASK THAT YOU PLEASE CALL YES IN. ARE THE- ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. YES THIS IS TOM BOTTOM. YOU MAY BEGIN YOUR MAKE YES WE CAN HEAR YOU. A GOOD AFTERNOON THANK YOU THE APPRECIATE YOUR TAKING THE TIME DATE THE SO WHAT.

BOB AB TWENTY THREE TWO REPRESENT OVER TO YEARS OF COLLABORATION AND COOPERATION REPORT POLLUTION OF GLOBAL JUSTICE REFORM ADVOCATE. WELL MARKING. BUT GRASSROOTS ORGANIZATIONS SERVICE PROVIDERS AND IMPORTANT LIKE WHICH DID YOU PRE ORDER LOOK FORWARD TO BEING AND THE- ALIKE TO REPRESENTATIVES OF THE BUG. YEAH DOPPEL POLE AGES ASSOCIATION. ALL OVER AT BUT HAVE NOT BEEN AGREED ON EVERY DETAIL IN OUR DISCUSSIONS CONTINUE THE WILLINGNESS OF SO MANY DEDICATED PEOPLE TO ENGAGE IN THE COST OF THE OFFER THEIR POINT OF VIEW AND COOPER RECOMMENDATION SO SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED THE CONSTANT FOLKS OF THIS LEGISLATION. WE ARE HONORED TO BE PART OF THE- AB TWENTY THREE FORTY TWO IS ROOTED IN THE UNDERSTANDING OF THE PRINCIPAL OBJECTIVE OF POSTCARDS REGION SIMPLE BUSINESS ACCORDINGLY. MANAGING KURDS EPISODE TAKE THE SUCCESSFUL REINTEGRATION OF PEOPLE ON FULL. AB TWENTY THREE FOUR TWO IS ALSO CONSISTENT WITH THE SCIENCE AND RESEARCH THAT SUPPORTS A FINDING THAT FAILURE ON POOL MOST OFTEN OCCURS IN THE MEDIA WEEKS AND MONTHS AFTER CHRISTMAS RELEASED. RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT THE OPPORTUNITY FOR SUCCESS IS IMPROVED. WHEN DETERMINATIONS ABOUT THE LINK THE NATURE COMMITTED SO PROVISIONAL REFLECT EACH PERSON'S UNIQUE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT THE EIGHT OR- AND ONE ALSO OF PLACES EMPHASIS ON REWARDED POKING TOPPLE. GOOD ACTORS THIS IN A CRITICAL LIFE SKILLS RATHER THAN MERELY PUNISHING THEM COULD MISTAKES. LOSE PROVIDE A CERTAIN NUMBER FOR. THANK QUICKLY. THAT CAN LEAD TO AVOID IN THE TERM OF CALL.

ED NOW WE HEAR FROM OPPOSITION- WITNESSES- YOU MAY OPEN UP THE LINE MISTER MODERATOR. WHAT IMPRESSED. ONE ZERO FRIENDLY COMMENT ONE ZERO I THE IS MATT PLEASE WITH THE HELP ON CORRECTIONAL PEOPLE THE YES IS FOR THANK MEDICARE. AND YET THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR COMMITTEE MEMBERS THAT THE PPO REPRESENT NEARLY THIRTY THOUSAND CORRECTIONAL PEACE OFFICERS AND PAROLE AGENTS ACROSS THE STATE. OKAY I'M HERE TO EXPRESS THE ASSOCIATION OF HOLD ELECTED MENDED POSITION FOR ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY THREE FORTY TWO. IF YOU EIGHT THAT THE PREVIOUS THE AUTHORS WILLING AT THE FALLS THAT FOSTER YOU TO DISCUSS OUR ISSUE THEN CONTINUE WORKING TOWARD A RESOLUTION WHICH- I THINK YOU'RE IS ULTIMATELY A REAL POSSIBILITY. I'D LIKE TO THANK THE AUTHOR AND SPONSORS FOR THE INCLUSION OF THE PAROLE AGENT CASELOAD CAPS CONTAINED IN THE BILL. I THINK THIS IS A PROVISION THAT'LL CERTAINLY RESULT IN MORE EFFECTIVE AND PRODUCTIVE SUPERVISION BY OUR POLL AGENTS WITH A MORE MANAGEABLE CASELOAD. WHAT THE PPO A IS NOT INHERENTLY OPPOSED TO THE IDEA THIRD OFFENDERS BEING GRANTED AN OPPORTUNITY FOR EARLY DISCHARGE WE HAVE COULD NEVER GET CONCERNS WITH A BROAD RANGE OF OFFENDERS THAT WOULD BE INCLUDED. SPECIFICALLY THE INCLUSION OF GANG MEMBERS ARE SENATE AND TOTALLY FORGET TO LIFETIME PAROLE TERMS ARE PROBLEMATIC. THE GANG MEMBERS AN ARSONIST A REQUIRED REGISTER HAVE AN ESTABLISHED HISTORY OF VIOLENT OR DANGEROUS BEHAVIOR. AND SHOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR DISCHARGE AFTER ONLY SIX MONTHS. AND UNDER CURRENT LAW LIKE TEMPORALLY THEY'RE ELIGIBLE FOR DISCARDED VIEW AND EARLY IN ONLY FIVE YEARS FOR SECOND DEGREE MURDER AND SEVEN FOR FIRST DEGREE MURDER. SO THEY SHIPPED ONLY A HUNDRED EIGHTY DAYS AND THE PATIENT TO ENSURE THESE INDIVIDUALS WILL NOT CONTINUE VIOLENT BEHAVIOR. WE'D LIKE TO SEE AB TWENTY THREE FORTY TWO AMENDED TO INCLUDE THESE INDIVIDUALS FROM THE POSSIBILITY OF THE SIX MONTH DISCHARGE. ADDITIONALLY THERE SHOULD BE A REQUIREMENT THAT POLICE SPECIFIC CRIMINAL GENIC NEED THEIR MATT AND ADDRESS PRIOR TO THEIR DISCHARGE. AT THIS BILL DOES ACTUALLY CONTAIN THIS REQUIREMENT FOR ALL SUBSEQUENT REVIEW PERIOD BUT THE CRIMINAL SACRAMENTO GENIC NEEDS. ARE ABSENT FROM THE INITIAL REVIEW. WE ALSO HAVE SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS WITH THE RESTRICTIVE DEFINITION OF GOOD BECAUSE- AS WRITTEN GOOD BECAUSE MOST PERSUASIVELY SUGGEST THAT PERSON POSES AN UNACCEPTABLE RISK FOR COMMITTING A SERIOUS VIOLENT OFFENCE IF DISCHARGED. AND THAT REQUIREMENT- THAT THE RICH BE POSED ONLY FOR SERIOUS OR VIOLENT OFFENSES IS INSUFFICIENT TO ENSURE THE PUBLIC SAFETY. SAMPLE APPROACH WITH. INDICATORS THAT THEY'RE LIKELY TO COMMIT AN ACT OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE OR THOUGHT WOULD NOT SATISFY THAT REQUIREMENT. WE'D LIKE TO SEE THAT GOOD BECAUSE BE BROADENED TO ALLOW FOR CONSIDERATION OF RISK THAT MIGHT NOT NECESSARILY BE SERIOUS OR VIOLENT OFFENSES. BUT STILL DEMONSTRATE THAT AN INDIVIDUAL POSES A SUBSTANTIAL RISK OF COMMITTING OTHER SIGNIFICANT AND SAYS. NTT PEELING OFF BUT CONCERNS WITH THE BILL'S REQUIREMENT THAT A NEW OFFENDER VIOLATION RESULT IN A CUSTODIAL THINKING ABOUT LEAST TEN CONSECUTIVE DAYS. FOR THAT EVENT TO. BE SUFFICIENT TO JUSTIFY ATTENTION. THERE SHOULDN'T BE A CUSTODIAL THANKING REQUIREMENT IN ORDER TO JUSTIFY THE RETENTION ESPECIALLY WANTED SIGNIFICANT TEN DAYS. ONE OR MORE OFFENSES ARE VIOLATIONS SHOULD BE SUFFICIENT AS LONG AS THEY INDICATE THAT THE PERSON ON PRO PROCEEDS AND REASONABLE RISK OF DANGER TO THE PUBLIC. AND THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE IN CONTACT OF THE ENTIRETY OF THIS BILL WERE THE PRO WILL BE ELIGIBLE FOR ANOTHER REVIEW IN ONLY SIX MONTHS. IN LIGHT OF THE ISSUE THE PPO A MUST TAKE AN OPPOSING BUT THE MINUTE POSITION BUT WE REALLY LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING OUR DISCUSSIONS TO RESOLVE THE ASSOCIATION CONCERNS. AND ALTHOUGH OUR ISSUES WITH THE BILL AND PRINT ARE SIGNIFICANT I THINK THERE'S A REAL POTENTIAL PATH FORWARD FOR OUR MEMBERS- GETTING TO A PLATE THAT THEY COULD LIVE WITH. BUT WE CERTAINLY HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO. AND I LOOK FORWARD TO OUR CONTINUED DISCUSSION WITH THE FAMILY MEMBER AND STAFF. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU. ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION NAME. AND ORGANIZATION MISTER MODERATOR. NINE FOUR ZERO FIVE GO AHEAD PLEASE. HEY I THINK I GOT PUT ON AROUND HERE THIS IS A MEGA MALL- WITH THE YOUNG WOMAN FREEDOM CENTER CROWD C<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt;&lt;/c&gt;</u> FUNCTIONS OF THE FILL. IN SUPPORT. IF YOU MADE A MISTAKE. YES ANYONE ONE ELSE. WE HAVE A LINE FOUR ZERO SEVEN GOING. THANK YOU MY APOLOGIES ALSO FOR BEING IN THE WRONG QUEUE MY NAME IS JEFF NOR PROFESSOR OF ENGLISH AT SACRAMENTO CITY COLLEGE. WHERE I WORK WITH OUR- POST INCARCERATED STUDENTS. NOT RE EMERGING SCHOLARS PROGRAM I'M IN STRONG SUPPORT OF 23-14 THANK YOU. THANK YOU THE LAST ONE IN LINE AND TWO EIGHT EIGHT ZERO GO AHEAD. JENNIFER ROLE ON BEHALF OF THE CHAMBER AND YOU KNOW COUNTY SHERIFF COMPLETE BENEFIT ASSOCIATION IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND I WAS THE LUCKY TO. NOW BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE MEMBERS ANY QUESTIONS. COMMENTS ARE CONCERNED. SEE SEE NONE OF. IT'S ENCOURAGING THAT YOUR QUESTION COM GOOD. ASSEMBLYMEMBER CARDIO. THANK YOU I'M I'M CURIOUS- IF- MR MAT EASILY STILL ON THE LINE. I CAN ADDRESS A QUESTION TO THE BSA. AT THANK YOU I'M YOU YOU MENTIONED- FORMER GANG MEMBERS BEING- TAKEN OFF OF THIS POTENTIAL PAROLE- BILL SO I REPRESENT EAST LA IN A LOT OF COMMUNITIES THAT SUFFERED FROM A LOT OF GANG VIOLENCE IN THE EIGHTIES AND NINETIES AND- WE'VE SEEN IN MANY WAYS A RETURN OF SOME OF THESE INCARCERATED FOLKS- AND MANY MANY RESIDENTS ARE. THEY THEY THINK ABOUT THEIR SAFETY QUITE A BIT AND I'M CURIOUS AS TO WHAT YOUR- PERSPECTIVE IS WHEN IT COMES TO. THE RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO PAROLE OFFICERS IN AN EFFORT TO ADDRESS- OPPORTUNITIES AND RESOURCES FOR THOSE THAT ARE RETURNING BACK ON THE STREET AND I SAY THAT TO SAY THAT IN A TIME OF COAL IT. WE ARE SEEING AN INCREASE OF TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE AND EVEN 24% OF UNEMPLOYMENT. AND SO FOR COMMUNITIES LIKE MINE THAT ARE IMPACTED WHAT ARE SOME OF THE RESOURCES THAT YOU NEED. SO THAT OUR COMMUNITIES ARE SAFER WELL WE'RE ALSO TRYING TO ADDRESS- CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM. AND THE ABILITY FOR PEOPLE TO GET TO WORK AND SO ONE OF THE WITNESSES IN SUPPORT SPOKE ABOUT HAVING TO TRAVEL LONG DISTANCES. AND SO IF THE PAROLE OFFICER IS WITHIN A CERTAIN REGION IN A PAROLE LEE IS WITHIN A CERTAIN REGION WHERE THERE IS NO WORK. WHAT ARE SOME OF THE SUGGESTIONS THAT YOU MAY HAVE ON HOW WE CAN WORK TOGETHER TO RESOLVE. SOME OF THE BIGGEST ISSUES THAT WE FACE AND THAT'S REALLY ACCESS TO A JOB. YOU HAVE BUT THAT. AND QUITE A FEW QUESTION. ROLLED UP IN THERE I'D I'D START BY THING AND WITH WHAT THE- WHAT ARE POLL FOLKS NEED. MOST IS THAT AND I THINK SOME OF WHICH IS ACTUALLY CONTAINED IN THE BILL BOTH CASELOAD CAPS WILL DEFINITELY ALLOW OUR PATROL AGENT TO- BETTER FACILITATE SERVICES BECAUSE THEY'LL BE ABLE TO BETTER MANAGE THEIR CASELOADS- RIGHT NOW THEY'RE JUST SO OVERWHELMED THERE'S VERY LIMITED TIME AVAILABLE TO ACTUALLY- TO ACTUALLY. BEEN TIME DEDICATED TO AN INDIVIDUAL AND SPEAKING OUT SERVICES THAT ARE AVAILABLE SECONDLY. I KNOW THAT YOU OVER THE LOT AT THE DECADE SERVICES HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY. PRODUCED AND CUT RIGHT UP IN MANY AREAS AND SO THE ACT THAT YOU SERVICES HAS REALLY DWINDLE- AND SO I THINK ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR ACTUAL COMMUNITY SERVICES. IN THAT. WOULD BE TREMENDOUSLY HELPFUL- TO ACTUALLY GET THE GOALIE THE HELPFULNESS THAT NEED. AS FAR AS THAT JOHN BEING AVAILABLE A PARTICULAR GEOGRAPHIC REGION I KNOW THAT THERE ARE CURRENTLY PROPERTIES AVAILABLE NOW IN ORDER TO BE GRANTED TRAVEL PASSES FOR PAROLEES SO THAT THEY CAN TRAVEL OUTSIDETHE RESTRICTED REGION UP FOR SOMETHING LIKE A JOB. SECONDLY IN I DIDN'T REALLY ADDRESS THE REINTEGRATION CREDITS PORTION OF THIS BILL BUT IT THAT THAT THE REINTEGRATION CREDITS PORTION THE BILL DOES INCLUDE PROVISIONS THAT ALLOW FOR ADDITIONAL TRAVEL DISTANCE FOR- SCHOOL EDUCATION AND THINGS LIKE THAT SO I THINK THERE ARE OTHER MECHANISMS. BUT REALLY FUNDING. FUNDING FOR THOSE LOCAL SERVICES INCLUDING EMPLOYMENT SERVICE AND- WOULD BE A TREMENDOUS HELP. FOR ALL POLL AGENT AND FOR THE PROCEEDS THAT THEY'RE TRYING TO SERVE. THANK YOU I THINK THAT ACTUALLY HELPS. WHAT WHAT THE INTENT OF THIS BILL IT IS THAT IF THE IF OFFICERS DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES CURRENTLY AT HAND AND THERE IS NO INCREASE IN BUDGETS. AND PAROLEES HAVE A HISTORY OF GOOD BEHAVIOR FOR MORE THAN A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY DAYS BEING DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AS WELL AS THE BOARD OF PAROLE HEARINGS MAKES A RECOMMENDATION THAT THEY NO LONGER NEED TO BE ON PAROLE. THEN WHY SHOUL THEY BE ON PAROLE WHY DON'T WE ALLEVIATE SOME OF THOSE RESOURCES FOR PAROLE OFFICERS TO ACTUALLY CONTINUE TO DO THE WORK NECESSARY FOR THOSE THAT CONTINUE TO BE ON PAROLE. WELL ACTUALLY GIVING AN OPPORTUNITY TO SOMEONE TO START A NEW LIFE AND TO. BE JUDGED BASED ON THEIR MOST RECENT BEHAVIOR- NOT BY THE HAIR THAT COSTA TO BE INCARCERATED TO BEGIN WITH I THINK IF WE ARE TO LOOK AT. WHAT ACTUAL. CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM LOOKS LIKE IT LOOKS LIKE AGAIN AND I WILL MENTION THIS BECAUSE OF MY OWN OF A NONPROFIT THAT WE HAVE IN MY DISTRICT HOMEBOY INDUSTRIES. THAT NOTHING STOP SIMPLE IT LIKE A JOB. AND THE OPPORTUNITY FOR SOMEONE TO EARN A LIVING. EVEN THROUGH THIS CRISIS RIGHT NOW ONE OR SEEN SO MUCH UNEMPLOYMENT. THE ABILITY FOR SOMEBODY TO. BE TAKEN OFF PAROLE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO STARTING A LIFE BE RECONNECTED. WITH THEIR FAMILY TO LIVE IN DIGNITY. I THINK IT'S A PLACE THAT WE ALL WANTTO GET TO AND IT'S GOING TO BE INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT AND CHALLENGING AND SO I THINK. MR MCCARTY I THINK THIS BILL IS IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION AND I HOPE THAT YOU CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION TO COME TO A CONCLUSION AND I THINK WE ALL WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR PAROLE OFFICERS HAVE THE RESOURCES THEY NEED. THEY NEED TO DO THEIR JOBS. WHILE AT THE SAME TIME WE CREATE A SOCIETY IN WHICH- JUDGES AN INDIVIDUAL FOR. WHO THEY CURRENTLY ARE NOT FOR A CRIME THAT THEY COMMITTED IN THE PAST THAT THEY'VE ALREADY PAID FOR. AND SO I THINK- I THINK IT'S A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS. THANK YOU I WAS SUPER QUICK STATEMENT. THIS BILL SPECIFICALLY ADDRESSES SERIOUS AND VIOLENT FELON. AND I THINK THAT NEEDS TO BE BALANCED AS WE CONSIDER ALL THESE NEW PROVISIONS THE VICTIMS INVOLVED ARE GETTING NO CONSIDERATION. THANK YOU. WITH THAT YOU MAY CLOSE. THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THAT THIS IS A BALANCE SAYS WE HEARD FROM. I VICE CHAIR MISTER LACKEY I THINK THIS ATTEMPT TO STRIKE THAT WORK WE'RE COMMITTED TO KEEP WORKING ON THIS ISSUE- YOU KNOW THIS IS ABOUT WHAT MAKES THE MOST SENSE FOR CALIFORNIA AND- WE ALL WANT THE SAME THING PEOPLE WHO ARE RELEASED TO SUCCEED AND NOT RE OFFEND AND NOT HARM THEIR COMMUNITY THEIR FAMILIES OR END UP BACK IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM SO. AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER CARDIO MENTIONED THAT- HAVING THE FOCUS ON THE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE ON PAROLE TO HAVE THIS THE FOCUS AND PEOPLE ARE DOING WELL TO TAKE OFF THAT LIST IS JUST COMMON SENSE- WE ALSO HAVE IT HERE WHICH WE NEED TO WORK OUT THROUGH THE BUDGET CONSIDERATIONS. IS THE RATIOS BECAUSE NO MATTER WHAT YOU THINK PEOPLE WOULD THINK THAT HAVING FEWER PEOPLE ON YOUR DOCKET TO SUPERVISE IS A BETTER THING- SO HAVING THE RATIOS GO FROM ONE TO FORTY- SUPPOSE FROM ONE TO FIFTY THREE IS A GOOD THING. AND THEN LASTLY IS THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE ON PAROLE. HOW THE SCARLET LETTER THAT. IT IS WHAT IT IS IT'S IT IT HURTS THEIR ABILITY TO. TO CERTAINLY TRAVEL SEE LOVE ONCE BUT GET A JOB. AND MOVE ON WITH OUR LIVES AND IF WE REALLY WANT PEOPLE. TO SUCCEED WE SHOULD FOCUS ON WHAT PRO REALLY IS NOT PUNISHMENT. IT'S HELPING PEOPLE RE INTEGRATE BACK TO SOCIETY AND HAVING THE SECOND PRIZE BILL WE CAN ONLY TALK ABOUT WHICH I THINK IS TO THEM AND EVERYBODY COULD EMBRACE WHICH IS. HATE AND IT WAS ON PAROLE YOU GO TO COLLEGE FOR A YEAR. YOU CAN REDUCE YOUR TIME. YOU GO TO A REHAB OR TREATMENT WE'RE GONNA REDUCE YOUR TIME ON PAROLE THE VOLUNTEER WITH HOMEBOY INDUSTRIES OF SACRAMENTOFOODBANK DOING COMMUNITY WORK. YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE YOUR TIME ONE PRO REDUCE I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE COULD ALL EMBRACE AS WELL SO WITH THAT ASK YOUR RIVAL TODAY THANK YOU. AND THANK YOU AND I AM ENCOURAGE. WHEN THE OPPOSITION MR EASILY MENTIONED- SOME GOOD POINTS IN YOUR BILL THAT I THINK. THE CPO A- IN OTHER GROUP ME RAY. SAW IS A POSITIVE IN A MOVIE FOR THE OTHER PARTS ABOUT. PROTECTING YOU KNOW VICTIMS OF CRIME IS BEING CONSIDERED OF THEM- IS SOMETHING THAT I THINK CCPOA. AND OTHERS CAN WORK WITH YOU TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ADDRESS THAT ALSO AND SO WITH THAT IN A COMMAND I HOPE. WE NEED A SECOND.
