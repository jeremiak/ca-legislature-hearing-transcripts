AND AND WILL HOPEFULLY BE LUCKY ENOUGH TO HAVE HER FOR SOME TIME UNTIL A MORE PERMANENT -- INDIVIDUAL IS -- SIGNED BROTHER [inaudible] SO [inaudible] WE WILL [inaudible] WELCOME SENATOR. THE CHURCH TAKE YOUR TAKE A MOMENT WOULD YOU LIKE A CUP OF WATER NO THANK YOU GLASS OF WINE WOULD BE BETTER BUT NOT NOW. I HEAR YOU. I HEAR A SISTER OKAY. OKAY THANK YOU FOR YOUR INDULGENCE OF COURSE OF COURSE FIRST UP IS -- WELL BOTH OF THE BILLS ARE YOURS SO FEEL FREE WHICHEVER ONE YOU WANT TO START WELL WHY DON'T WE START WITH THE SENIOR MASTER PLAN. WHICH IS -- IN EXCITINGLY AMBITIOUS AND LONG OVERDUE MEASURE -- THAT WILL -- CREATE A FRAMEWORK FOR A MASTER PLAN. FOR AN AGING CALIFORNIA THAT EMPOWERS ALL CALIFORNIANS TO AGE WITH DIGNITY CHOICE AND INDEPENDENCE. NOT THAT IT'S ANYTHING I'M PERSONALLY. IN NEED OF RIGHT AT THE MOMENT BUT WE DO KNOW THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS AN AGING STATE. THAT WE ARE GOING TO HAVE FOUR MILLION MORE SENIORS IN OUR STATE BY TWENTY THIRTY AND WE ARE ABSOLUTELY TOTALLY UNPREPARED. SO. THE PUBLIC POLICY INSTITUTE OF CALIFORNIA AS I MENTIONED. ESTIMATED THIS NUMBER OF FOUR MILLION ADDITIONAL SENIORS. OVER THE AGE OF SIXTY FIVE BY. TWENTY THIRTY ANY IMPLICATIONS AFFECT NOT ONLY OLDER ADULTS AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES BUT ALSO THEIR FAMILIES. LOCAL COMMUNITIES AS WELL SO STATE. 20% OF CALIFORNIA'S OLDER ADULTS LIVE IN POVERTY AS WE SPEAK. AND THIS NUMBER IS EXPECTED TO INCREASE WITH THE AGING OF OUR STATE. 90% OF OLDER ADULTS WOULD LIKE TO AGE IN THEIR HOMES AND I DON'T THINK THAT'S A SHOCKING NUMBER I SUSPECT IT'S AT LEAST THAT'S WHERE WE'RE COMFORTABLE THAT'S WERE WERE FAMILIAR THAT'S WHAT WE KNOW THAT'S WHERE WE'VE LIVED OUR NEIGHBORS OURFRIENDS OUR COMMUNITIES ARE ALL RIGHT THERE. BUT OFTEN LACK OF ACCESS TO THE NECESSARY SERVICES. AND SUPPORT MAKE IT DIFFICULT IF NOT POSSIBLE TO DO THAT. WE'RE ALSO FACING UP. THIS CREATES A CRISIS OF REALLY IT. ENORMOUS PROPORTIONS WERE ALREADY IN NEGATIVE BIRTH RATE STATE AND AS THE STATE AGES WE NEED MORE SERVICES AND SUPPORTS FOR OLDER ADULTS. BUT THE REALITY IS THE COST OF LONG TERM CARE SERVICES AND SUPPORTS IS ON AFFORDABLE FOR MOST CALIFORNIANS AND FRANKLY AS WE TIGHTEN UP THE REQUIREMENTS FOR IN HOME HEALTH SERVICES. AS WE SHOULD THE COST TO ACCESS THIS KIND OF HERE CARE BECOMES EVEN MORE EXPENSIVE. SO WE KNOW THE ANNUAL COST OF THIRTY HOURS A WEEK OF HOME CARE. IS ALMOST THIRTY SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS THREE QUARTERS OF THE STATE'S MEDIAN HOUSEHOLD INCOME. THE MEDIAN ANNUAL COST OF NURSING HOME CARE IS A WHOPPING HUNDRED TWELVE THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR WHICH IS MORE THAN TWICE -- THE STATE'S MEDIAN HOUSEHOLD INCOME AND ONLY 5% OF CALIFORNIANS AGE FORTY AND OLDER HAVE ACTUALLY EVEN PURCHASE PRIVATE LONG TERM CARE INSURANCE. I IT'S NOT A VERY DESIRABLE PRODUCT. AND IT'S NOT VERY AFFORDABLE AND YET. WHEN PEOPLE AGE THERE'S REALLY NOTHING THERE TO PROTECT THEM -- IN THAT. IT IN THEIR LIVES SO -- ACROSS THE STREET THE STATE OLDER ADULTS PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES AND FAMILIES RELY ON SERVICES PROVIDED THROUGH MULTIPLE STATE AGENCIES. INCLUDING DEPARTMENT HEALTH CARE SERVICES SOCIAL SERVICES AGING REHABILITATION TRANSPORTATION I MEAN IT'S THE GAMBIT EVERYTHING YOU CAN THINK OF DOES HAVE AN EFFECT AND IS NECESSARY IN PARTICULAR GREATER LEVELS. AS PEOPLE AGE THEY'RE NOT ABLE TO DRIVE THEY SHOULDN'T DRIVE THEY HAVE HEALTHCARE ISSUES THEY HAVE COGNITIVE ISSUES THEY HAVE PHYSICAL IMPAIRMENTS. THAT NOT ONLY ARE DISABILITY COMMUNITY IN GENERAL BUT ALSO MOBILITY ISSUES ALL THE THINGS THAT HAPPEN AS WE AGE AND WE ARE LIVING LONGER. I JUST LOST MY MOTHER IN LAW IN DECEMBER AT THE AGE OF ONE HUNDRED AND FOUR YEARS OLD -- SO -- AND THOSE ARE STORIES WE HEAR MORE AND MORE PEOPLE LIVING LONGER AND LONGER AND WE HAVE THE INABILITY TO CARE FOR THEM. SO DESPITE THE MANY PROGRAMS AND SERVICES ADMINISTERED BY THE RANGE OF THESE DEPARTMENTS. FAMILY STRUGGLE TO WEAVE TOGETHER SERVICES AND FINANCE CARE IN THE HOPES OF HELPING LOVED ONES REMAIN IN THEIR HOMES. INDIVIDUALS AND THEIR FAMILIES DON'T KNOW WHERE TO TURN FOR HELP OR HOW TO PAY FOR SERVICES. THAT WOULD HELP IS FINALLY FOUND MANY PEOPLE ARE BOUNCE BETWEEN PROGRAMS WITHOUT. MUCH ASSURANCE THAT THOSE NEEDS WILL BE MET. WE NEED IS WE NEED A SENIOR MASTER PLAN THAT IS DIRECTLY ACCOUNTABLE TO THE GOVERNOR TO LEAD THE STATE'S EFFORTS -- TO TO READY US TO DEAL WITH THIS AGING POPULATION WE HAVE ALL THESE MULTIPLE SERVICES THEY DON'T TALK TO EACH OTHER THEY ARE COMMITTED IN ANY WAY SHAPE OR FORM TO ADDRESSING THE PROBLEMS OF OUR AGING POPULATION PER SE. THEY'RE ALL IN THEIR LITTLE NATION THEY'RE ALL IN THEIR LITTLE SILO AND YET THAT THE NEEDS OF THE PEOPLE AS THEY AGE ARE NOT SINGULAR. FOR MULTI FACETED AND WE HAVE NO WAY TO ACCOMMODATE THEM SO. TO TOGETHER WITH THE TASK FORCE WHOSE MEMBERS WILL BE APPOINTED BY THE GOVERNOR AND THE LEGISLATURE WE HAVE A DIRECTOR TAP ASKED WITH EVALUATING EXISTING PROGRAMS AND SERVICES WORKING ACROSS STATE AGENCIES GOD FOR BID. TO ADDRESS BOTTLENECKS PROGRAMMATIC -- SHORTFALLS IN NEEDS TO CREATE SENIOR BASED HOUSING TO DEAL WITH TRANSPORTATION ISSUES HEALTHCARE ISSUES THE WHOLE GAMBIT AND ALSO TO TO ALLOW PEOPLE NOT ONLY TO AGE IN PLACE BUT TO AGE WITH DIGNITY. TO BE ABLE AND THE NUMBER ONE ISSUE WE HEAR IN TALKING TO SENIORS AND I THINK MY EXPERT YOU WILL CONFIRM THIS THE NUMBER ONE CONCERN THAT SENIORS HAVE HIS ISOLATION. WE DON'T WANT THOSE PEOPLE HAVE GIVEN THEIR LIVES TO RAISE THEIR FAMILIES THEY PAY TAXES THEY'VE BEEN CONTRIBUTING MEMBERS OF SOCIETY SOCIETY TO AGE ALONE. THERE'S MORE THAT WE CAN DO WITH THIS SETTING UP THIS MASTER PLAN I THINK IS THE WAY TO DO THIS I KNOW MY PREDECESSOR -- THAT MY GOOD FRIEND CAROL LOU WORKED ON THIS ISSUE SEVERAL YEARS AGO IT'S NOT A NEW ISSUE IT WAS EVEN SOMETHING THAT WAS RAISED PRIOR TO THAT. BUT WE ARE HERE FOLKS AND WE HAVE GOT TO ADDRESSES PROCESS IN THIS PROBLEM SO JOINING ME TODAY BETSY BUTLER CHAIR OF THE CALIFORNIA COMMISSION ON AGING. ALONG WITH GARY PASS MORE FROM THE CALIFORNIA. THE CONGRESS OF CALIFORNIA SHOULD. NEVER GOTTEN IT RIGHT THE CONGRESS OF CALIFORNIA SENIORS ARE HERE TO TESTIFY THANK YOU FIRST. OKAY -- THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- GERMAN IS THERE IN A MEMBERS IT'S A IT'S A PLEASURE TO BE HERE MY NAME IS BETSY BY LEARNING THE CHAIR OF THAT CALIFORNIA COMMISSION ON AGING -- AGING VERY QUICKLY JUST HAVING ANOTHER BIRTHDAY TWO WEEKS AGO IT'S LIKE WOW I'M GETTING OLD FAST BUT IT WOULD BE TO ALTERNATIVE THEY SAY WELL THAT'S WHAT THEY YEAH YEAH RIGHT -- SO THE CALIFORNIA COMMISSION ON AGING IS VERY PLEASED TO SUPPORT -- SB TWO TWENTY EIGHT IT'S VERY MUCH NEEDED -- BILL AND WE'RE IN A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO REALLY AFFECT CHANGE ALL THE THINGS THE SENATOR JUST MENTIONED I MEAN THEY ALL ARE INTERRELATED INTER RELATED -- AN AGING PERSON HAS A LOT OF NEEDS IN THE STATE AND THE POPULATION'S GOING SO MUCH EVERY SINGLE DAY SO -- WE APPLY THE SENATOR FOR YOUR LIFELONG COMMITMENT -- TO HELPING OLDER AMERICANS AND PARTICULARLY NOW WITH THESE THESE VERY TENUOUS TIMES FOR A NUMBER OF SENIORS -- FACING HOMELESSNESS OR ANY FOOD IN SECURITY AND HEALTH CARE CRISES SO -- I THINK A MASTER PLAN WILL BE VERY HELPFUL IN HELPING ARTICULATED DELINEATE THE NEEDS OF THE HAVE A VERY LARGE POPULATION HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- WE DID THE COMMISSION ON AGING DID PUT OUT A STATEMENT OF PRIORITIES FOR THE MASTER PLAN ON AGING IT TO GO TO THEM I KNOW WHEN TO ALL MEMBERS HERE. I DID GO TO THE GOVERNOR -- AND IT PROVIDES -- OR ASKED. FOR VERY IMPORTANT THINGS INCLUDING PROVIDING INTEGRATED AFFORDABLE AND ACCESSIBLE MEDI MEDICAL OR MENTAL HEALTH CARE PROVIDING EASY ACCESS TO SUPPORTIVE SERVICES AND INFORMATION -- SUPPORTING THE VITAL ROLES OF PROFESSIONAL AND FAMILY CARE GIVERS CARE GIVING IS SUCH A HUGE ASPECT OF AGING IN CALIFORNIA -- MOSTLY. WOMEN WHO ARE PROVIDING THE SERVICES TO AND LOW PAID UNFORTUNATELY MOST OF THE TIME -- BUILDING MORE OLDER ADULT AND MULTI AGE HOUSING -- INTERGENERATIONAL HOUSING AS WE KNOW IT COMPLEMENTED BY AGE APPROPRIATE SERVICES AND TRANSPORTATION -- INSURING A A QUALITY AGING SERVICES WORKFORCE -- BY EXPANDING GERONTOLOGY AND GERIATRIC EDUCATION PROGRAMS AND ENHANCING CAREER PASSED WE KNOW THAT. THERE'S LITERALLY ONE GERIATRICIAN FOR SEVENTY EIGHT HUNDRED PEOPLE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THOSE NUMBERS ARE -- EVERY YEAR GROWING EXPONENTIALLY AND AN INTEL WE REALLY COMMIT FINANCES AND RESOURCES TO THESE MATTERS ARE NOT GOING TO HAVE MORE GERIATRICIANS -- AND AND PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSISTANCE FOR OLDER PEOPLE IS IS WORSE IT'S LIKE TWENTY EIGHT THOUSAND PSYCHOLOGIST EVERY OLDER PERSON OR TWENTY THOUSAND TO ONE PSYCHOLOGIST SO IT'S IT'S VERY CONCERNING. PROTECTING OLDER ADULTS FROM IN JUSTICE INCLUDING ABUSE FRAUD AND DISCRIMINATION OF COURSE AS A PRIORITY. AND PROMOTING MORE ACCURATE PERCEPTIONS. OF THE POSITIVE POTENTIAL OF LONGEVITY WE HAVE A LOT OF WISDOM AS WE AGE AND AGEISM IS A VERY SCARY THING -- SO GO AHEAD SENATOR AND JUST FIX ALL THESE PROBLEMS -- WITH THE GOVERNOR I AM -- PARTICULARLY HEARTENED BY THE FACT THERE'S BEEN NO NO VOTES -- THUS FAR SO THERE'S NO LINE ITEMS ON ANYTHING RIGHT YET SO IT'S BUT WE'RE GETTING THERE AND HOPEFULLY EVERYONE THE COMMITTEE -- WILL BE SUPPORTIVE AND AND WE ARE HERE IN SUPPORT OF THAT AS WELL THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS I'M GARY PASSED MORE PRESIDENT OF THE CONGRESS OF CALIFORNIA SENIORS. I'D LIKE TO BEGIN THIS -- DISCUSSION WITH MY PERSONAL THANKS TO SENATOR JACKSON. FOR BEING ON THIS ISSUE AND FOCUSING ON OUR PROBLEMS AND NEEDS FOR MANY MANY YEARS I PERSONALLY HAVE BEEN AT THIS JOB. FOR JUST UNDER TWENTY YEARS IT'LL BE TWENTY YEARS IN JANUARY WHICH IS KIND OF MIND BLOWING IN ITSELF. AND I'VE ACTUALLY EXPERIENCE SOME OF THE NEEDS FOR THESE PROGRAMS SO I CAN SPEAK PERSONALLY. ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF MAKING THEM AVAILABLE. AS A STATE WE FIND OURSELVES IN AN ODD SITUATION CALIFORNIA'S. FOR DECADES BEEN CONSIDERED A YOUNG STATE AND KIDS BUT OUR MAIN FOCUS. BUT BECAUSE OF THE TIMING OF THE BABY BOOMERS THE END OF THE SECOND WORLD WAR ALL SHOWING UP IN CALIFORNIA. COMING FARMING FAMILY FAMILIES. ALL THE FIRST UP. REALITY THAT THEY CALL AS WAS A DEMAND FOR PRIMARY SCHOOLS AND SECONDARY SCHOOLS WITHIN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND THEN COMMUNITY COLLEGES. AND THEN THE FORMATION OF NEW SUBURBS IN INFRASTRUCTURE AND NOW THEY ARE MY AGE THEY ARE SEVENTIES. AND THEY NEED HELP. MANY OF THEM HAVE NOT PREPARED PROPERLY. AW MANY OF THEM CAN'T PREPARE GIVEN THAT THE COST STRUCTURE THAT WE FACE. AND SO THIS GOVERNOR HAS. OF VERY GENEROUSLY COMMITTED HIMSELF TO FORMING. A MASTER PLAN ON AGING AND I THINK THAT THIS BILL. BRINGS THE LEGISLATURE END OF THAT PROCESS WHICH IT NEEDS TO BE. AS AN ADVOCATE LIVES SINCE THE BEGINNING OF A DISCUSSION OF A MASTER PLAN I FELT VERY STRONGLY THAT WE NEED TO COMBINE BOTH THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH. BUT ALSO LEGISLATIVE OUR CONCERN AND INTEREST AND AWARENESS OF OF OUR PROBLEMS AND NEEDS. AND THIS BILL LAYS OUT WAYS TO DO THAT -- THEY'LL BE A LITTLE BIT OF FINE TUNING OF WHAT THIS. BILL CONTAINS WITH WHAT THE GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE ORDER PROPOSES. BUT I THINK THAT THAT'S ACHIEVABLE. AND WE WE ARE COMMITTED LIKE I SAID IT'S BEEN TWENTY YEARS. AND I CAN'T REMEMBER UP ANY ONE OF THOSE YEARS WHEN I DIDN'T DREAM OF TUESDAY. UP OF OF COMING TOGETHER. TO PLAN FOR WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE IN CALIFORNIA AND TO TAKE A BROAD LOOK. AT THE NEEDS OF OF AGING AND ADULTS WITH DISABILITIES WHO ARE GROWING IN NUMBERS. UP AND THAT. I THINK WE GO BACK TO THE SEVENTIES WHEN CALIFORNIA'S LAST AN INNOVATOR IN PROVIDING AGING SERVICES. AND TOO OFTEN SINCE THEN WE HAVE HELD ON TO CUT BACK -- BARELY GOTTEN BY AND IT'S IT'S TIME. TO TAKE A STAND AND TO PLAN. AND TO BE WORKING TOGETHER TO MEET THE NEEDS OF AT LEAST FOUR MILLION NEW CALIFORNIANS SO THAT THEY CAN. GROW INTO THEIR GOLDEN YEARS IN THE GOLDEN STATE. WITH DIGNITY AND WITH A PROSPERITY AND I APPRECIATE YOUR SUPPORT THE BILL. UP AND IT'S ONE OF OUR IT'S ONE OF OUR STRONG PRIORITIES AND AGAIN THANK YOU -- THANK YOU VERY MUCH. UP. ANY OTHER COMMENTS IN SUPPORT. HI GOOD AFTERNOON HEATHER HARRISON WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSISTED LIVING ASSOCIATION IT'S WONDERFUL TO SEE SO MUCH MOMENTUM ON THIS ISSUE WHERE IN STRONG SUPPORT. JENNIFER TANNEHILL WITH ERIN READ MISTER SEE IT'S ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA DENTAL HYGIENISTS ASSOCIATION ALSO IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU. JUSTIN GARRETT THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU. KELLY BROOKS HERE THIS AFTERNOON ON BEHALF OF THE VENTURA COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. LAUREN RALPH CALIFORNIA SENIOR LEGISLATURE IN SUPPORT -- MICHAEL RIGHT AGAIN ABOUT THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS SANTA CLARA COUNTY IN SUPPORT. RESIDENTS ALSO ME HALF OF THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF SOCIAL WORKERS IN STRONG SUPPORT. YES TERREL CLOSED WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF AREA AGENCIES ON AGING VERY MUCH IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU. OKAY ANY. TESTIMONY IN OPPOSITION. PLEASE SPEAKERS IN OPPOSITION. GREAT ANY COMMENTS FROM. THE COMMITTEE [inaudible] YES MISERABLE. SENATOR JACKSON THIS IS A SPOT ON BILL GREATLY NEEDED I SUPPORTED A 100%. BUT I HAVE TO MAKE A CONFESSION. I SPENT THIRTY NINE YEARS IN THE INSURANCE BUSINESS IN ABOUT TWENTY YEARS AGO WHEN INSURANCE COMPANIES DEVELOPED LONG TERM CARE INSURANCE. I JUMPED ON IT -- I COULD NAME OFF VARIOUS INSURANCE COMPANIES THEY CAME OUT WITH EXCELLENT PRODUCTS [inaudible] WONDERFUL BENEFITS. AND I WOULD HAVE BEEN PAID A TEN OR 12% COMMISSION TO SELL IT. SO I STARTED OUT LONG TERM CARE SALES WITH RICH PEOPLE GETTING CARE. THEN I WENT TO UPPER MIDDLE CLASS [inaudible] HEARING CARE. SAME WAY WITH MIDDLE CLASS NO DIDN'T THINK THEY NEEDED IT. LOWER MIDDLE CLASS. WELL NOW WE HAVE TROUBLE OF FORTY NINE AND THEN I EVEN WENT DOWN TO JUST REGULAR BLUE COLLAR WORKERS THAT I KNEW MAN YOU'RE IN TROUBLE IF YOU DON'T. BUY THIS STUFF [inaudible] NO. SO LONG TERM CARE INSURANCE THE PERCEPTION OF HUMAN BEINGS IS. THEY DON'T NEED IT UNTIL THEY NEEDED. THEY DON'T WANT TO PAY FOR IT AHEAD OF TIME [inaudible] SO. I SUPPORT THIS BILL FROM A FEELING OF I DON'T KNOW HOW I COULD PUT IT. SOME OF FAILED CAPITALIST AT LONG TERM CARE INSURANCE RIGHT. SO GOVERNMENT NEEDS TO STEP IN ON THIS. ONE AND SENATOR JACKSON IS. LEADING THE WAY I DON'T KNOW WHAT WILL COME OUT OF THIS REPORT. BUT I'M GONNA BE LOOKING AT IT VERY CLOSELY BECAUSE WE HAVE THE SILVER TSUNAMI HITTING THIS I'M GOING TO BE SIXTY NINE YEARS OLD. AND I DIDN'T BUY LONG TERM CARE INSURANCE BECAUSE BY THE TIME I PERCEIVED I MIGHT NEED. TO IT WAS TOO EXPENSIVE. SO I'M JUST AS BAD AS MY CLIENTS. SO THAT'S WHY SUPPORT YOUR BILL AND I THANK GOD YOU HAVE IT. THANK YOU OF THIS RACE. I HAD A GOOD INSURANCE GUY I DID BUY LONG TERM CARE. THE NO NO REFLECTION ON YOU MY DEAR MY DEAR. NEIGHBOR. I I DO WANT TO THANK YOU SENATOR I THINK THAT WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ANY OF THESE IMPORTANT ISSUES FOR CALIFORNIA WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE PLAN IS. AND IT CAN'T JUST BE MISHMASH AND DEAL YOU DO THIS AND YOU DO THAT BECAUSE AS YOU'VE INDICATED THEIR SILOS ALL OVER THE PLACE AND EVERYBODY'S DOING THEIR THEIR SHARE. AND DOING WONDERFUL JOBS BUT UNTIL WE SAY THIS IS SUCH AN IMPORTANT ISSUE WE WANT A MASTER PLAN. I APPRECIATED THAT THE GOVERNOR IN HIS STATE OF THE STATE OF THE STATE OR MAYBE WAS WHEN HE WAS SWORN IN. BUT WHEN HE TALKED ABOUT THIS -- I KNEW WAS IMPORTANT BEFORE I KNEW IT WAS IMPORTANT THEN AND I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT YOU WERE THE ONE TAKING THE LEAD. I KNOW LAST YEAR WE TALKED ABOUT IT AND WE'LL RECOGNIZE HOW IMPORTANT WAS I THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR FOR DOING THIS. AND FOR PUTTING TOGETHER THE BASICALLY WHAT WE'RE GOING TO NEED TO DO IT AND IN THAT REGARD. I HAVE ASKED ALSO TO BE A CO AUTHOR OF YOUR BILL I WOULD LIKE TO BE PART OF THIS ISSUE CERTAIN [inaudible] GREAT. YES THE SERVICE THAT I WON ON IT ALSO LIKE TO BE ADDED AS A CO AUTHOR OF THE CAN [inaudible] THANK YOU. WHAT IS THAT? OKAY THANK YOU. FOUR FIVE YES SIR I THINK AT THIS POINT THE ONLY ONES LEFT OUT ARE OF MISS CALL MISTER KALRA IS ALREADY ON MISTER LACKEY AND MYSELF. ALL RIGHT. I'M I'M I THINK I JOINED ALREADY BUT IF NOT I'M HAPPY TO JOIN AS WELL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION IT'S A GREAT BILL IT'S A TIMELY BILL I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE LEGISLATURE ALSO TO HAVE ITS OWN VEHICLE. AS THE AS THE GOVERNOR'S ADMINISTRATION IS MOVING FORWARD WITH TRYING TO FLESH OUT ITS PROPOSAL NOW SO -- I THINK IT'S IT'S OF AB IT BOTH MAINTAINS ACCOUNTABILITY AS WELL AS HELPS OFFER COMPLIMENTING VIEW POINTS AS WELL. SO LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU -- AND THE ADMINISTRATION AND ACCOMPLISHING THE GOALS AT HAND THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THIS IMPORTANT AND TIMELY BILL. SIR BILL ENJOYS A DO PASSED THE ASSEMBLY HUMAN SERVICES -- I BELIEVE THERE WAS A FIRST BY MISS MISS RUBIO AND A SECOND BY. MS BERNARD **** BATH LET'S CALL THE ROLL. SB TWO TWO EIGHT MS IRAN HI MS ARE IN AYE VOEPEL. VOEPEL I WARNER HER VIA. WARNER HORROR ROTH AYE KALRA. KALRA I LACKEY. LACKEY AYE REYES AYE REYES AYE. RUBIO. RUBIO AYE THE MEASURE PASSES. GREAT THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THEY WANT TO ITEM NUMBER TWO SB TWO EIGHTY OKAY. SO I'VE BEEN ASKED TO BE QUICK ON THE NEXT ITEM AND I CERTAINLY I'M HAPPY TO DO THAT BUT I DID WANT TO SORT OF FRAME THIS. YOU KNOW SOMETIMES THERE ARE EASY FIXES OR IT'S EASY EASIER WAYS TO ADDRESS PROBLEMS. AND THIS BILL IT REFLECTS ONE OF THE EASIER WAYS TO DEAL. AGAIN WITH SENIORS AND WITH OUR DISABILITY COMMUNITY. BY TRYING TO DO PREVENTION. IT'S ALWAYS WORTH A POUND OF CURE I DON'T KNOW IF YOUNG PEOPLE SAY THAT ANYMORE BUT I REMEMBER HEARING IT AT HOME QUITE REGULARLY AS A KID GROWING UP. THIS MEASURE SB TWO EIGHTY IS THE DIGNITY AT HOME ACT IT SEEKS TO ALLOW MORE SENIORS AND DISABLED PEOPLE TO AGE IN PLACE AND STAY IN THEIR OWN HOMES THROUGH THE USE. OF HOME MODIFICATIONS TO HELP REDUCE THE RISK OF FALLING. WHEN YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THE STATISTICS ON PEOPLE WHO ARE -- COMING TO EMERGENCY ROOMS PARTICULARLY SENIORS AT LEAST THE THIRD IF NOT MORE ARE PRESENTED EMERGENCY ROOMS BECAUSE OF FALLS IN THEIR HOME. USUALLY IN THE BATHROOM. USUALLY IN THE SHOWER. WE HAVE GRAB OURS THERE ARE HE VERY SIMPLE METHOD TO HELP PEOPLE WHOSE WHO ARE LOSING THEIR BALANCE OR WHO ARE SLIPPING IN WHAT IS OTHERWISE IT A KIND OF CHALLENGING. ENVIRONMENT TO KEEP THEM FROM FALLING BECAUSE WHEN THEY FALL THEY HURT THEMSELVES THEY HURT THEMSELVES DRAMATICALLY TO THE POINT WHERE MANY SENIORS. WHO FALL AND HAD A PRESENTED HOSPITALS DON'T EVER GET TO GO BACK HOME? WELL THAT SEEMS RIDICULOUS IF WE CAN DO SIMPLE MEASURES LIKE GRAB BARS OR HAVING PEOPLE FROM THE AREA AGENCY ON AGING -- GET GRANTS WHICH WE SEE FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN THE BUDGET TO HELP WITH THAT NOW GIVING MONEY TO THESE FOLKS TO GO IN AND TO INSPECT PEOPLE'S HOME PARTICULARLY LOW INCOME PEOPLE WHO CAN'T OTHERWISE NECESSARILY AFFORD TO GRAB BAR. TO GO IN AND INSPECT THE HOME AND SAY YOU KNOW WHAT. YOU'VE GOT A RUG OVER HERE LET'S TAKE A HAMMER AND A NAIL A NAIL IT DOWN SO YOU DON'T TRIP. YOU NEED A BAR YOU NEED A HIGHER LEVEL TORRENT YOU NEED A A GRAB BAR IN THE SHOWER THESE ARE RELATIVELY SIMPLE THINGS THAT WE CAN DO. TO HELP OUR SENIORS SO THAT THEY DON'T FALL. BECAUSE FALLS CAN BE SIGNIFICANT AND ALSO FOR OUR DISABILITY COMMUNITY YOU KNOW WHEN YOU'RE IN A CHAIR. IT'S HARD TO GET THROUGH A DOORWAY THAT DOESN'T ACCOMMODATE YOU BUT YOU WANT TO STAY AT HOME YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO STAY HOME BECAUSE FRANKLY THERE'S REALLY NOT TOO MANY OTHER OPTIONS. SO THIS IS A BILL WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THE BUILDING COMMUNITY AND AND I THINK AT THIS POINT TIME THERE CERTAINLY OFF THEIR OPPOSITION I WANT TO BRING THEM ALONG TOO BECAUSE THIS IS A KIND OF THING WE SHOULD BE DOING FOR FOLKS SO -- I THINK THAT THIS IS A A SORT OF A NO BRAINER KIND BILL WE GOT MONEY IN THE BUDGET THIS YEAR FORD -- WILL PUT THE MONEY IN THE PROCESS TOGETHER AND WILL HELP A LOT OF SENIORS AND A LOT OF OUR DISABLED COMMUNITY BE ABLE TO STAY AT HOME. IT'S SAFER IT'S BETTER IT'S LESS EXPENSIVE FOR ALL OF US AND IT'S IT'S THE KIND OF THING WHERE COMPASSION COMMONSENSE COME TOGETHER SO WITH THAT I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR IPHONE THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK [inaudible] HI HERO. YET YOU SAID IT ALL FOR ME BUT BETTER. MY NAME IS DONNA MILO. AND I AM REPRESENTING THE NATIONAL MS SOCIETY. THIS IS A MESS BOYCE IT'S THE BEST. WE GET. I WAS LUCKY TO BE DIAGNOSED AT THE AGE OF SIXTY WITH THE DISEASE THAT. USUALLY HITS THE YOUNG. UNFORTUNATELY BY THE TIME I WAS DIAGNOSED. I WAS SECONDARY PROGRESSIVE. AS BAD AS IT GETS. AND I PROGRESS RAPIDLY. MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS AFFECTS MUSCLE STRAIN BALANCE COORDINATION. ALL OF THE WHICH MAKE THE FALLS. A TO FREQUENT EVENT. MY WORST FALL. A BROKE EVERY TO ON MY LEFT FOOT AGAIN LUCKY. COULD HAVE BEEN ONE OF MY HANDS. OVER THE YEARS. WE'VE. BEEN ABLE TO DO A A NUMBER OF THINGS. TO OUR HOME SO THAT WE CAN STAY THERE. WE PUT GRAB BARS ON THE TOILET. GRAB BARS ON THE WALL IN THE BATHROOM. SMALL RUBBER RAMPS TO GET OVER THE THRESHOLD AT THE FRONT DOOR. AGAIN LUCKY NO SCARES. A BAD CASE. THAT I CAN HOLD ON TO TO CHANGE POSITIONS. IT HOLDS MY STUFF [inaudible] REMOTE PHONE -- IT KEEPS ME FROM FALLING OUT OF BED. MY PERSONAL FAVORITE. SWING AWAY DOOR HINGES. SO THAT I CAN GET INTO. THE BEDROOMS AND BATHROOMS IN MY OWN HOME. THESE MINOR AIDS ALLOW ME TO MAINTAIN MY QUALITY OF LIFE. AND TO REMAIN ACTIVE IN MY COMMUNITY. LIKE VOLUNTEERING AT THE ZOO. THE FINANCIAL COST. OF CRIME DISEASES. DISABILITIES AND OLD FOLKS OLDER FOLKS. ALL OF WHOM I REPRESENT CAN BE -- REYES. YOU SPEND ALL OF YOUR AVAILABLE CASH. YOU SPEND ALL OF YOUR SAVINGS. YOU START DRAWING DOWN ON YOUR RETIREMENT. IF YOU HAVE ANY. FINALLY YOU DEPEND ON THE KINDNESS OF STRANGERS. WITH THE HOUSING. MEDICAID AND SSJ. I HAVE SEVERAL FRIENDS. IN THAT LAST GROUP. WHO COULD REALLY BENEFIT? FROM THE WONDERFUL PROGRAM YOU'RE OFFERING. IF THEY KNOW ABOUT IT. I BELIEVE THAT SB. TWO EIGHTY WOULD BE. A REAL GIFT FOR THEM. I SINCERELY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT OF THIS PROGRAM. AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. AND I HAVE TO SAY I WE BOTH HAVE LONG TERM CARE INSURANCE THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU. MY NAME'S LAUREN RALPH AND I'M A SENIOR SIMPLY MEMBER WITH THE CALIFORNIA SENIOR -- LEGISLATURE. FOR NAPA SOLANO AND DOWN. HI. ORIGINALLY WROTE THE PROPOSAL OR A PROPOSAL FOR THIS BILL AND SENATOR JACKSON PICKED IT UP. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT -- MY MY FIRST INTEREST IN FALLS PREVENTION CAME BECAUSE MY STEP MOM. FELL. AND SHATTERED HER FEMUR. AND SHE LIVED IN AN OLDER HOME -- AND SHE HAD TO GO TO A SKILLED NURSING FACILITY. AND EVEN AFTER SHE WAS ABLE TO GET INTO A WHEELCHAIR. AND MOVE AROUND YOU KNOW SO THAT SHE COULD. OF POTENTIALLY LIVE AT HOME SHE COULDN'T COME HOME BECAUSE HER HOME DIDN'T ALLOW HER TO GET INTO IT IN A WHEELCHAIR. SHE WAS A VERY LARGE WOMAN AND SHE COULDN'T THE CHAIR WOULD NOT FIT IN. AND I COULDN'T BRING HER INTO MY HOME BECAUSE I CHAIR WOULDN'T FIT IN I CAN'T GET THE CHAIR IS MEDITECH NONE OF MY FRIENDS. WHO USE CHAIRS CAN GET INTO MY HOME WHICH IS KIND OF AN EMBARRASSING THING TO ME BUT I CAN'T AFFORD TO REBUILD MY HOME? SO CALIFORNIA HAS TO IMPENDING CRISIS ONE IS THE LACK OF HOUSING THAT'S AFFORDABLE FOR YOUNG AND OLD CALIFORNIANS. AND THE SECOND IS HOW WE PAY FOR MEDICAL HOME CARE NEEDS OF OUR SENIOR POPULATION. BY TWO THOUSAND THIRTY THE SENIOR POPULATION IN CALIFORNIA WILL -- WELL WE ALREADY HEARD THAT INCREASED BY MORE THAN FOUR MILLION. IT'S ESTIMATED THAT BY TWENTY TWENTY THE ANNUAL AN INDIRECT COSTS THE FALLS IS EXPECTED TO REACH FIFTY FOUR POINT NINE MILLION. THE MAJORITY OF THOSE COST WILL BE BORNE BY MEDICARE AND MEDI CAL. GIVEN CALIFORNIA'S NEED TO DRAMATICALLY INCREASE AVAILABLE HOUSING IT'S A PERFECT TIME FOR THE STATE TO MAKE THAT HOUSING MORE AGING DISABILITY FRIENDLY. BY INCORPORATING FALLS PREVENTION OR SPECIFIC ACCESSIBLE FEATURES INTO THE STATE BUILDING STANDARDS FOR ALL CALIFORNIA HOUSING. MAKING THESE CHANGES WILL ALLOW RESIDENTS TO STAY IN THEIR HOMES AS THEY AGE AND ALLOW FAMILIES TO EASILY BRING THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS ELDER OR OR DISABLED INTO THEIR HOMES. AS THEY NEED ADDITIONAL SUPPORT. POLICY FEATURED CAN BE MUCH LESS COSTLY WHEN BUILT INTO THE ORIGINAL DESIGN OF THE HOUSING. DEVELOPMENT AND INDIVIDUAL HOMES RATHER THAN RETROFITTING EXISTING HOMES. THE REQUESTED FEATURES IN SB TWO EIGHTY WILL NOT SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGE THE LOOK OR THE COST OF BUILDING THE HOUSE. CREATING FOR EVER HOMES FOR CALIFORNIANS CAN ALSO PRESERVE WEALTH SO THAT CALIFORNIANS WILL BE ABLE TO SAVE MONEY AS THEY AGE. BY NOT HAVING TO MOVE WHEN THEIR PHYSICAL ABILITIES BECOME REDUCED AND HAVE THE RESOURCE TO HAVE THE HELP THAT THEY NEED AS THEY AGE. IN AN EFFORT TO INCREASE AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS OUR STATE GOVERNMENT NEEDS TO MAKE SMART DECISIONS. ABOUT CREATING HOUSING THAT LASTS FOR SENIORS. FAMILIES AND PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES THANK YOU. ORGANIZATIONS AND SUPPORT. YES MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I'M BOB ROEMER WITH THE CALIFORNIA BUILDING INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION WHY ARE FORMER POSITION IS NEUTRAL I THINK IT SHOULD BE NOTED WE WERE ORIGINALLY HAD STRONG OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. IN ITS EARLIEST FORM WE WORK WITH THE AUTHOR STAFF IN THE SPONSORS THE ADDRESSED ALL OF OUR ISSUES ALLOWING US TO GO NEUTRAL -- IN JUST A MATTER OF MONTHS -- WILL BE WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING -- TO BASICALLY REQUIRE GRAB BAR SUPPORT BACKING IN ALL BATHROOMS OF ALL NEW HOMES. ARE HAVING AT LEAST ONE WIDER A BEDROOM DOOR ONE WIDER BATHROOM DOOR -- THESE ARE RELATIVELY LOW COST THINGS THAT WE CAN PUT INTO ALL NEW CONSTRUCTION OF FOR THE FUTURE SO THANK YOU AND YOUR STAFF FOR WORKING WITH US. THANK YOU [inaudible] WELL. YES THERE ARE CATCH WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF AREA AGENCIES ON AGING THE SENATORS CORRECT THIS IS A NO BRAINER. I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT HERE AGENCIES ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO STEPPING UP AND BEING PART OF OF TAKING THIS OUT INTO THE COMMUNITY. TELLING THE ASSESSMENTS HELPING TO MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT WHAT IS NEEDED. FOR INDIVIDUALS TO BILLS STAY IN THEIR HOME SO WE THANK THE SENATOR FOR CARRYING THIS BILL [inaudible] THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MADELINE COOPER ON BEHALF OF THE COUNTY OF SAN DIEGO AND CONTRA COSTA COUNTY IN SUPPORT THANK YOU THANK YOU. GARY PASSED MORE CONGRESS OF CALIFORNIA SENIORS. LET ME TAKE JUST ONE SECOND OF FIVE MILLION TELL YOU MY PERSONAL STORY ABOUT FALLS -- ABOUT A YEAR AND A HALF AGO I WAS RUSHING INTO THIS BUILDING ON THE SOUTH SIDE. COMING UP THE SIDEWALK. AND I FELT. AW AND I FELT RIGHT DOWN ON MY FACE. AND ALL AFTER ABOUT AN HOUR OF HAVING PEOPLE HELP ME AND GIVE ME PULL TOGETHER AN AMBULANCE CAME AND PICKED ME UP I WENT TO THE ER. AND DISCOVERED THAT I HAD FOR STROKES IN THAT PERIOD OF TIME. AND COULD EASILY HAVE DIED. AND MY HEART STOPPED AT SOME POINT. ALL OF WHICH IS A LONG LONG WAY OF DESCRIBING THE REHAB THAT I HAVE UNDERGONE. THE AMOUNT OF EFFORT AND IT WAS ALL AS A RESULT OF THAT FALL. AND AND I LITERALLY FALL ABOUT ONCE EVERY TWO WEEKS JUST NOW JUST TRYING TO NEGOTIATE. AND IT'S FRIGHTENING AND IT NEEDS TO BE I NEED HELP WITH IT THERE'S NO DOUBT ABOUT IT SO I THANK THIS CENTER.

WE OPEN THE DOOR AND THEY WILL SEE MY GOODNESS THE VALUE FOR THE DOLLAR. IS ENORMOUS -- FOR EVERY DOLLAR WE SPEND I SUSPECT WE SAVE. MANY FOLD IN PEOPLE NOT HAVING TO GO TO THE HOSPITAL NOT HAVING TO BE IN NURSING HOMES -- GO THROUGH REHABILITATION I JUST THINK AGAIN IT'S IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS WHERE WE'RE OTHERWISE PENNY WISE AND POUND FOOLISH BUT THIS IS THE FIRST STEP.
