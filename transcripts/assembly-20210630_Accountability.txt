RIGHT THANKS VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR AND I KNOW EVERYONE'S BOUNCING BETWEEN COMMITTEES HERE BUT THAT THANKS SO MUCH FOR GIVING US OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT. SB SEVENTEEN. WHICH IS A BILL THAT WOULD OPPOSITE ABOLITION OFFICE OF RACIAL EQUITY AND RACIAL EQUITY ADVISORY AND ACCOUNTABILITY COUNCIL NOR TO ADDRESS SYSTEMIC AND INSTITUTIONAL RACISM. THERE'S A THAT HAS RESULTED IN NOT ONLY POOR HEALTH OUTCOMES AND DISPARITIES IN THE STATE BUT OTHER. POOR OUTCOMES AS WELL THIS BILL IS LONG OVERDUE IS THE DOWN PAYMENT TOWARD THE STATE PLAYING A MORE ACTIVE ROLE IN DISMANTLING OVER THREE HUNDRED YEARS OF RACIAL INEQUITIES. AND TRYING AND ENDING SYSTEMIC RACISM. EXTENSIVE RESEARCH HAS IDENTIFIED RACISM AS A PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS LEADING TO SIGNIFICANT HEALTH DISPARITIES. INCLUDING DISPARITIES IN INFANT AND MATERNAL MORTALITY CHRONIC DISEASE PREVALENCE LIFE EXPECTANCY. AND EVEN COVERED MORTALITY THIS PANDEMIC AND CERTAINLY MANY MORE. AND WHILE THE STATE HAS MADE EFFORTS TO ACKNOWLEDGE AND CONFRONT RACIAL DISPARITIES IN RECENT YEARS. EQUITIES OFTEN BEEN TREATED AS AN AFTERTHOUGHTOR THE SILENCE STRATEGY. THIS BILL WILL ESTABLISH AN OFFICE OF RACIAL EQUITY WHICH WILL COORDINATE AND LEAD CALIFORNIA'S EFFORTS IN EXAMINING AND ENDING SYSTEMIC RACISM. AND HOLDING OUR SELVES ACCOUNTABLE TO ADDRESSING THIS LONG STANDING ISSUE I HAVE AMENDMENTS THAT WOULD CLARIFY THE ROLE OF THE OFFICE OF RACIAL EQUITY IN RELATION TO THE GOVERNOR'S CHIEF EQUITY OFFICER WHICH IS PROPOSED IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET. WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE ADMINISTRATION AND THIS COMMITTEE TO ENSURE THAT THE OFFICE CAN EFFECTIVELY CARRY OUT ITS DUTIES AND MEET THE GOALS ESTABLISHED IN THIS BILL. SB SEVENTEEN IS SPONSORED AND SUPPORTED BY A WIDE ARRAY OF STAKEHOLDERS INCLUDING LABOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT ADVOCATES COMMUNITIES ORGANIZATIONS HEALTH PROVIDERS AND PUBLIC HEALTH PROFESSIONALS. THAT RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE I DO HAVE TO CO SPONSORS WHO WILL BE TESTIFYING SUPPORT THE BILL ELENA SANTA MARIA OUT WITH NEXT IN CALIFORNIA AND CREEK SAMUELS WITH THE COMMUNITY COALITION SPECIALLY AT THE PRIVATE THANK YOU. WONDERFUL AND I JUST TO CONFIRM I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN WORKING WITH MY COMMITTEE STEPHENS AMENDMENTS. THE AMENDMENTS WOULD ADD H. CHIEF EQUITY OFFICER WITHIN COPS TO WORK WITH THE OFFICE OF RACIAL EQUITY. AND STATE AGENCIES TO IMPLEMENT THESE NEW REQUIREMENTS ASSEMBLY YOU HAVE AGREED TO TAKE THAT AMENDMENT YES WONDERFUL THANK YOU. BYE AND AS YOU SAID WE'VE GOT TO WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. OUR MODERATOR PLEASE CAN YOU CONNECT US WITH. KIRK SAMUELS. FROM THE COMMUNITY COALITION. BOTH TIMES ARE OPEN. ALL RIGHT HELLO THERE GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS CLARK SPANIELS AND I'M CALLING TO SPEAK ON- SPEAK WITH YOU ALL TODAY ABOUT SB SEVENTEEN OUR RECORDS- THE DIRECTOR OF CIVIC ENGAGEMENT FOR NONPROFIT LOCATED IN SOUTH LOS ANGELES CALL COMMUNITY COALITIONS VALUES ARE CENTERED ON ADVANCING RACIAL EQUITY AND SOCIAL JUSTICE I'M ALSO SPEAKING TO YOU ALSO BLACK MAN IN AMERICA WHO IS COGNIZANT OF THE MOMENT OUR NATION IS IN AND WHAT IS AT STAKE. I WAS SPEAKING WITH YOU ALL TODAY- SB SEVENTEEN BECAUSE I WITNESSED THE GREATEST OUTCRY FOR RACIAL JUSTICE I'VE EVER SEEN IN MY ENTIRE LIFE JUST ONCE OVER A YEAR AGO WE ALL WATCHED IN HORROR AS GEORGE FORD WAS SENSELESSLY MURDERED LAST SUMMER AN OUTCRY FOR JUSTICE AT PUBLIC BERKELEY AFTER THAT MANY HAVE CALLED OF RACIAL RECKONING GRAYSON RECKONING FOR THIS COUNTRY ON ON THE HILLS OF THIS TRAGEDY WE SEE WE ARE SEEING THE ENEMIES OF DEMOCRACY FIGHT TO SUPPRESS VOTING RIGHTS TARGETED AT BLACK COMMUNITIES AND OTHER COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. HILL CRITICAL POLICE REFORM POLICIES THAT COULD MOVE US FORWARD AN OUTRIGHT DECLINE AND BE FINE EFFORTS TO TEACH GREAT. ACTUAL HISTORY IN OUR SCHOOLS- THE CHOICE. WE ARE MAKING HERE COUPLE. WILL HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE AND HAVE TO PUT. POTENTIAL TO EITHER UPLOAD EFFORTS TO STEER THIS COUNTRY CALL- BACKWARDS INTO A DEEP HARM OF ALL OR BE A BEACON OF LIGHT. THIS COUNTRY NEEDS THAT CAN HELP SET A NEW TONE IN PASSPORT. CALIFORNIA DOES MATTERS IMMENSELY. AT THE STATE WE HAVE BEEN AT THE FOREFRONT OF PASSING SOME OF THE MOST IMPORTANT POLICIES TO HELP INTO STRUCTURAL HARM A CHRONIC DISINVESTMENT. THAT PERPETUATED RACIAL DISPARITIES ACROSS COMMUNITIES FROM TAXING THE WEALTHIEST CALIFORNIA TO HELP. FUND OUR EDUCATION HEALTHCARE SYSTEM TO REQUESTED BY LOW LEVEL NONVIOLENT FELONIES AS MISDEMEANORS HELPAGE. BEFORE YOU HAVE MADE GIANT STRIDES TO ATTEMPT TO CREATE AND STATE THAT PRIORITIZES EFFORTS TO MAKE A MORE JUST AND EQUITABLE FUTURE FOR EVERYONE. AND WHILE THESE EFFORTS ARE COMMENDABLE. WE KNOW THAT THERE IS A LONG ROAD AHEAD OF US AND MUCH MORE WORK TO BE DONE THIS IS WHY I BELIEVE THAT YOU ALL SHOULD BILL I ON SB SEVEN SPEAKING. ESTABLISHING AN OFFICE THAT CAN IMPLEMENT A STATEWIDE FRAMEWORK ON RACIAL EQUITY THAT CAN RECOMMEND STRATEGIES AND POLICIES THAT ADVANCE RACIAL EQUITY ACROSS STATE AGENCIES AND DEPARTMENTS IS GROUND BREAKING. WE KNOW THAT THIS GROUND BREAKING POLICY WON'T FIX STRUCTURAL RACISM BY ITSELF BUT IT DOES PUT A STAKE IN THE GROUND. AND AT THE STATE OF WHERE OUR VALUES ARE HERE IN LOS ANGELES I SEE MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES AND COMRADES. TIRELESSLY ORGANIZE AND FIGHT FOR CHANGE THE NAME IN AND MOVING HACKERS TO ADDRESS ANTI BLACK RACISM IN ITS MANY FORMS TO ENSURING THAT CHILDREN IN OUR COMMUNITIES HAVE HEALTHY FOOD OPTIONS IN THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD AND THE TOOLS THEY NEED. AND SCHOOLS TO SUPPORT THEIR BIGGEST AND BRIGHTEST FUTURES- THIS FRAMEWORK INCREASE ACCOUNTABILITY. WHICH CAN LEAD TO REAL STRUCTURAL CHANGES THAT WILL POSITIVELY IMPACT MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIA. CENTRALLY LEAD- THE LEAD BY. FOR THE REST OF THE- SO IN CLOSING I AM RESPECTFULLY ASKING FOR YOUR I. BOATS. THANK YOU.

AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS MY NAME'S ALAINA CENTENARIAN ON THE POLICY ADVISOR NEXT IN CALIFORNIA THANKS IN CALIFORNIA IS A NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION DEDICATED TO SUPPORTING AND ADVOCATING FOR SYSTEMIC POLICY AND PROGRAMMATIC SOLUTIONS TO ADDRESS RACISM. AND ITS ROLE IN EXACERBATING THE GLARING HEALTH EDUCATIONAL AND CRIMINAL JUSTICE CLIMATE AND HOUSING DISPARITIES WE SEE TODAY. AFTER AN ANALYSIS OF THE INITIAL IMPACT OF THE PANDEMIC TOOK ON THE PEOPLE WHO CALL CALIFORNIA HOME IT'S CLEAR TO SEE THE IMPACT OF RACISM AND RACIST PRACTICES ARE ALIVE AND WELL. ONE CLEAR EXAMPLE OF THIS NEED TO ADDRESS SYSTEMIC RACISM CAN BE FOUND WITHIN THE GOVERNMENT SPONSORED PRACTICE OF REDLINING. ALTHOUGH THOSE PRACTICES OCCURRED SEVENTY YEARS AGO CALIFORNIANS WHO LIVE IN THOSE AREAS TODAY. SHOULDER THE BURDEN OF DELIBERATE POLICY CHOICES OF THE PAST POOR TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE GENTRIFICATION THROUGH DESERT POOR AIR QUALITY LACK OF A RELIABLE INTERNET AND OTHER FACTORS IMPEDE A PERSON'S UPWARD MOBILITY. THIS CONDITION OF LIVING IS UNACCEPTABLE AND SHOULD NOT REMAIN THE STATUS QUO AS WE RECOVER FROM THE PANDEMIC. SB SEVENTEEN SIXTY AT THE TOP INSTITUTIONALIZED ADDRESSING SYSTEMIC RACISM BY PUTTING IN EQUITY AT THE FOREFRONT OF THE STATE THINKING VERSUS THE BACK END. DELIBERATE POLICY CHOICES OF THE PAST REQUIRED DELIBERATE POLICY SOLUTION NOW. TO MEDIATE HORRIBLE PUTTING THE STATE ON A TRAJECTORY OF BEING ANTI RACIST. CURRENTLY THE STATE OPERATED EQUITY WORKING WITH IT IN SILOS WITHIN EACH DEPARTMENT OR NOT AT ALL. THIS PROCESS LACKS TRANSPARENCY ACCOUNTABILITY AND BOTH ARE NEEDED TO FACILITATE MEANINGFUL CHANGE. EQUITY WILL WORK REQUIRES LOOKING AT THE END WE'RE FACING WORK THE STATE OPERATES LIKE PROCUREMENT CONTRACTS AND HIRING PRACTICES. WHILE ENSURING PROGRAMS GOVERNMENT AGENCIES ADMINISTER IN THEIR OUTWARD FACING BURKE ARE EQUITABLE. BY CREATING THE OFFICE OF RACIAL EQUITY THE STATE CAN FORMALIZE BEST PRACTICES LESSONS LEARNED UTILIZED SHARED RESOURCES TO MAXIMIZE EFFICIENCY AND PROVIDE SPACE FOR COMMUNITY DISH. TO SHARE THEIR LIVED EXPERIENCES. OF HEALTH POLICY AND PROGRAMS ARE WORKING TO HELP THEM OR PERPETUATING HARM. WHEN THE REDLINING MAPS OF THE NINETEEN THIRTIES NEAR POOR AIR QUALITY MAPS AND THE COOK AT NINETEEN IMPACT MAX OF TWENTY TWENTY THE DATA IS CLEAR.

THE BILL TOGETHER HERE THAT REALLY FITS THE MISSION OF THIS COMMITTEE WHICH IS ABOUT ACCOUNTABILITY- NOT JUST SORT OF PASSING OPEN ENDED GOALS- BUT ACTUALLY- HOLDING THIS ADMINISTRATION AND FINDING THE KIND OF GOVERNANCE STRUCTURES THAT WE'RE GONNA GET ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ALL KINDS OF PROGRAMS IN THIS CASE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES- HAPPY TO ACCEPT THAT COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS YOU CAN FIND THOSE ON PAGE FOR THE ANALYSIS I KNOW THERE'S A ONE OTHER LAYER OF DETAIL WE WANTED TO ADD IN THERE SO WE CAN. WE CAN ALSO- TALK ABOUT- HOW HOW I CAN COMMIT HERE TODAY TO ELEVATING NOT JUST THE ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING GOALS BUT ALSO THE HYDROGEN REFUELLING GOALS IN THIS LEGISLATION- WE RENAMED THE AUTHORITY DOES SO IT'S NOT JUST LIKE YOUR VEHICLE THIRTY TO ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE AUTHORITY SO OFTEN DEALT WITH THE TECHNICALITY ISSUE HERE- INSERTED NOT PUTTING TOO HEAVY OF A THUMB ON THE SCALE IN FAVOR OF ONE PARTICULAR TECHNOLOGY BUT ALSO HOPEFULLY THIS BILL BY. PUTTING A FIRM EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR INTO THIS AT THE ALREADY AND HAVING SOMEBODY THAT THE LEGISLATURE CAN BRING IN AND HOLD ACCOUNTABLE TO HOW WERE SHAPING UP TO MEET THESE GOALS HOPEFULLY THAT'LL ACTUALLY GIVE US SOME SENSE OF PROGRESS WE'RE MAKING SO YOU KNOW WE KNOW WERE WERE PATROLLING ECONOMY WERE ALSO BE CLEAN ENERGY ECONOMY TOO BUT WE DRIVE A LOT AND IF WE'RE GONNA MAKE THIS BIG TRANSITION TO A ZERO EMISSIONS FUTURE- IT'S ONLY GOING TO COME. IN THESE INCREMENTAL STEPS- WE'VE GOT SOME AMBITIOUS GOALS FROM THE GOVERNOR- FOR TWENTY TWENTY FIVE IN A NUMBER THESE YOUR MISSION SPACES- THERE'S A LOT OF MONEY MOVING IN THE SERENE AS WELL- BUT WE ACTUALLY THINK WE NEED THIS AUTHORITY TO PUT ALL TOGETHER AND HOPEFULLY PUT OUR STATE IN A POSITION WHERE WE CAN REALLY BE COMPETITIVE I I'M LOOKING AT THIS BILL AS A AS AN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IN THE BUSINESS A BUSINESS DRIVER FEEL NOT SO MUCH AS AN ENVIRONMENTAL BILL. OF MORE MANDATE IN ANY WAY BUT TO OFFER MAJOR AUTOMAKERS- FUELING COMPANIES- MENU. SHURI'S FOLKS WANTED. LIVE GET MY FRONT DOOR SOMEONE THEY CAN WORK WITH I THINK IT MAKES SENSE TO PUT THIS WITHIN GO BIZ I THINK THAT WAS IS THAT THE SMART CHANGING- ANYWAY I'M I'M EXCITED ABOUT HOW THIS BILLS OF ALL OF THAT I THINK WE CAN HOLD THIS WHOLE COALITION TOGETHER SO. HAPPY TO GET INTO SOME MORE DETAILS BUT I THINK THIS BILL WILL PUT CALIFORNIA SPOT WHERE WE WILL BE THE MOST POWERFUL NOT JUST CONSUMER THESE PRODUCTS BUT THE LARGEST EXPORTER IN THE WHOLE WORLD OF ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE TECHNOLOGY AND HOPEFULLY CREATE A LOT OF JOBS IN THE PROCESS BECAUSE- I DON'T WANT TO BE IMPORTING- LET HIM FROM SOUTH AMERICA.

I THINK IT WOULD CREATE FUNDING AND FINANCING TOOL TO SUPPORT THE VEHICLE INFRASTRUCTURE DEPLOYMENT EFFORT BRINGING PRIVATE INVESTMENT TO THE TABLE.

AND SO. YOU KNOW IN YOUR OPENING STATEMENT POINT IS THAT THIS BILLS. IN THE SPIRIT OF KINDNESS COMMITTEE AN ACCOUNT ON SO ON AND- ALTHOUGH I APPLAUD YOUR- GENERAL EFFORT ON TRYING TO REALLY PUSH- WITH THE DRAMATIC EFFORT FOR ELECTRIFICATION. YOU KNOW OF OUR TRANSPORTATION. SECTOR HERE AND I CAN SAY THAT I REPRESENT AS YOU KNOW YOU'VE BEEN TO MY DISTRICT I REPRESENT A DISTRICT IN THE HEART OF CALIFORNIA WE HAVE THE NINETY NINE- AS WELL AS THE- FIVE RUNNING. BOTH THROUGH MY DISTRICT SO PEOPLE FROM SAM CISCO IN LA REGULARLY DRIVE THROUGH AND LEAVE THEIR POLLUTION BEHIND- SO WE'RE SENSITIVE TO THIS YOU KNOW WE ARE PUSHING TO GET. A CLEAN HIGH SPEED RAIL INTO THE VALLEY ALTHOUGH THERE ARE SOME OF OUR COLLEAGUES FROM LA WHO. SEEM TO WANT TO REPLACE THAT WITH DIESEL TRAINS AND POLLUTION AGAIN- THAT'S NOT WHAT YOU'RE DOING HERE YOU'RE TRYING TO PUSH FOR A CLEAN- VEHICLE FORCE OUT THERE I JUST FEEL LIKE I WOULD LOVE TO. WORK ON THE BILL WITH THE WORK ON THIS BILL OR OR ANOTHER EFFORT TO REALLY REDUCE THE TWENTY IT'S ABSURD THE POOREST TWENTY NINE AGENCIES DOING DUPLICATIVE THANKS RIGHT AND THAT'S ACROSS. THE CROSS GOVERNMENT FRANKLY HERE IN CALIFORNIA BECAUSE THE LEGISLATURE PARTICULARLY IN THE LAST TWENTY YEARS. RATHER THAN DIGGING IN AND DEAL WITH THESE ISSUES WE LOVE TO KIND OF PONTIFICATE MAKE A BIG STATEMENT START A NEW AGENCY AND KICK SOME JOB OUT THAT THE NEVER GETS DONE THE WE COME BACK AND CLEAN IT UP LATER AND- IT'S CODES PERPETUAL CYCLE RIGHT NOW. AND I FEEL LIKE DESPITE YOUR GOOD INTENTIONS WERE WALKING DOWN THAT ROAD YET AGAIN WITH THIS BILL- WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO. I DON'T KNOW PARK THE BILL AND DIG INTO IT WITH THE COMMITTEE AND SEE IF WE COULD FIGURE OUT A WAY TO REDUCE. THOSE TWENTY NINE AGENCIES OR MOVE SOME OF THE SUPPORTER EVEN CENTRALIZED AUTHORITY ONE PLACE WHICH MAKES TONS OF SENSE TO ME RIGHT- IS THAT SOME YOU CONSIDERED YOU FEEL LIKE YOUR- TOO FAR DOWN THE LINE HERE. THE CHALLENGE I HAVE IS SO LET'S JUST TALK THROUGH THE BRIEF A FEW OF THE AGENCY SO TAKE LIKE HYSTERIA RESOURCES BOARD AND THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'RE INTERFACING WITH CITY ELECTRIC SECTOR THE GAS SECTOR AND YOU'RE TRYING TO INTERCONNECT THE HYDROGEN FUELING STATION OR A- AND YOU KNOW OUR ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING STATION. YOU GOTTA GO THROUGH BOTH THE LOCAL LAND USE THIRTY THAN PVC. I DON'T KNOW QUITE HOW IT STREAMLINED OR LIKE WHAT WHERE WE ARE WE TO LIMIT RIGHT BECAUSE THE AIRPORTS DRIVING IT ON THE AIR SIDE THEN THERE'S THE LOCAL DISTRICTS- MEAN ONE THING. I COULD OFFER MAYBE IT DOESN'T SATISFY YOU BUT THERE'S LANGUAGE IN HERE THE TALKS ABOUT SORT OF COORDINATING VARIOUS EFFORTS ACROSS RELEVANT STATE AGENCIES TO ENSURE THEY ARE NOT ENACTING RULES OR REGULATIONS THAT ARE IN CONFLICT WITH ONE ANOTHER. WHAT CAN WE E ALSO SAYS I MEAN IT TALKS ABOUT STREAMLINING TO BUT- IS THERE SOME WAY. TO BOLSTER THIS POSITION AND GO BEYOND COORDINATION MAYBE MAKING- I'M THINKING OUT LOUD HERE BUT JUST YOU KNOW MAKING RECOMMENDATIONS ABOUT IT- WE'RE SAYING NOT IN CONFLICT WE COULD ALSO TALK ABOUT DUPLICATION. THERE POTENTIALLY I'M I'M RETICENT TO JUST SAY LET'S PUT THIS ON HOLD BECAUSE THERE'S SO MUCH FEDERAL AND STATE MONEY MOVING I HONESTLY THINK WE NEED THIS NOW I'D LIKE I'M I DON'T I JUST KICK IT TO THE SPAGHETTI SOUP THAT IT CURRENTLY IS SO. I THINK WE NEED THIS NOW BUT A I'M OPEN TO. YEAH WHAT ELSE WOULD I WOULD JUST AND I WOULD JUST ADD SO MISTER I THINK IT WAS EVER FOR YOUR THOUGHTFUL COMMENTS I CERTAINLY WHEN I FIRST SAW THIS BUT I THINK THAT MAGIC CONSULTANT ACIDIFIED TO IT IS FOR THE NASCAR LOCAL OF INVOLVED AGENCIES. AND AGRO BUSINESS ACTUALLY GONE THROUGH AN EXERCISE OF OUTLINING THAT THE PIECE OF THE PUZZLE THAT EACH OF THOSE AGENCIES PLAY I DO THINK THERE PROBABLY IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR SOME SOME STREAMLINING AND SOME RATIONALIZATION BEYOND THIS. BUT I WOULD ALSO SAY THAT HAVING. AN AUTHORITY THAT IS THEN RESPONSIBLE FOR CHEATING THE SCHOOLS MAKES IT THAT CAN BE THE PERSON WE GO TO AND SAY. HEY ONE OF YOUR DELIVERABLES IS GOING TO BE STREAMLINING RATIONALIZING AND GETTING SOME OF THESE SUPERFLUOUS FOLKS OUT TO THE EXTENT THAT. THAT THERE ARE SUPERFLUOUS PLAYERS SO I'M I CERTAINLY WOULD IMAGINE THAT SENATOR STERN WOULD WELCOME YOUR- ENGAGEMENT AND INPUT ON THAT AS THIS IS MOVING. FROM THIS COMMITTEE IN TWO I WILL BE HEARD BY THE TRANSPORTATION COMMITTEE- CENTER RETURN HAS EXPRESSED A WILLINGNESS TO TAKES AMENDMENTS ON THE TECHNICALITY SIDE OF THINGS SO. TO THE EXTENT THAT THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO ENGAGE FURTHER BEFORE. THIS BECOMES FINAL PRODUCT I'M SURE HE'D WELCOME THAT WELL I APPRECIATE THAT MADAM CHAIR AND- YOU KNOW WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO TRANSPORTATION COMMITTEE. I BELIEVE THE CHAIR THE TRANSPORTATION IS ONE OF THE PEOPLE TRYING TO PUT DIESEL TRAINS IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. SO I WOULD JUST ASSUME TRUST CHAIR THIS COMMITTEE IF THE STAY ON TOPIC ON TOPIC WAS A GREAT. ENGAGE IN THE EFFORT. WHAT WHAT WHAT I WILL SAY CENTER NOT APPRECIATE- YOU KNOW YOUR THOUGHTFUL RESPONSE IN THE SENSE TO BE ABLE TO WORK WITH ME. IS MAYBE WE SHOULD CONSIDER- A SUNSET DATE. ON THIS UNDER AFTER LIKE THIS SO THAT THERE'S A MANDATED. REVIEW BECAUSE IN ESSENCE WHEN YOU ASK THE- KIM WHAT WHEN YOU HAS THIS NEW. ENTITY TO ELIMINATE DUPLICATIVE. AGENCY EFFORTS THAT'S ESSENTIALLY ASKING THIS ENTITY TO DO OUR JOB RIGHT BECAUSE WHERE THE LEGISLATURE IT'S OUR JOB TO DO THE OVERSIGHT OF YOU KNOW WHO'S GOT WHAT AUTHORITY AND- AND SO ON. BUT IF YOU HAD A SON TODAY YOU CAN LOOK AT HOW THIS WORKS HOW EFFECTIVE ARE THEY HAVEN'T COME BACK AND YOU KNOW BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE IT SOMETIME- TO THE CHAIRS POINT I'M CERTAINLY NOT GOING TO ASK YOU TO. TAKE THAT AMENDMENT HERE TODAY. SHE WAS TO WORK ON IT WE CAN TALK SOME MORE. ABOUT IT I MAY OR MAY NOT IT DOES AS THE BILL IS AND PRINT CURRENTLY AT SUNSET ON JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY NINE WHICH- YOU KNOW. YOU CAN DEBATE WHETHER OR NOT THAT'S A- APPROPRIATE TIME PRESENT BUT THERE IS A SENSE THAT IN THE BOOK. I GUESS WHAT. FOR APPOINTMENT VENTURA I THINK A SUNSET DATE MAYBE A LITTLE. SOONER THAN TWENTY TWENTY NINE MIGHT BE APPROPRIATE BECAUSE THIS IS AN IMPORTANT EFFORT. OUR BEGIN ON PROBABLY GONNA. LAY OFF TODAY- IT'LL KEEP DIALOGUING WITH YOU AND I SAID PRESHEAF WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO I THINK. IT'S A VALIANT EFFORT- IT JUST CONCERNS ME WE- HAVE A REALLY POOR HISTORY LEGISLATURE PUNTING. OUT TO BUREAUCRACY YOU KNOW. AND I THINK THAT'S A DANGEROUS THING WITHOUT THE APPROPRIATE MEASURES IN PLACE TO. MAKE SURE TO YOUR POINT WHERE YOU STARTED WITH YOUR PRESENTATION AT ITS ACCOUNTABLE SO THANKS FOR YOUR EFFORT APPRECIATE- YOU ENTERTAINING- SOME I THOUGHT. THANK YOU AND I AM COMMITTED HOPE WE CAN EARN YOUR VOTE. IF THIS GETS TO THE FLOOR- STARTED LOOK AT SUNSET ACCOUNTABILITY THE REPORTING FUNCTION HELLO WE CAN. HAPPY TO THINK THAT THROUGH AS WE MOVE IF WE GET TO MOVE FORWARD HERE. THANKS ALL RIGHT THANK YOU SENATOR ASSEMBLY MEMBER RODRIGUEZ YOU'RE JUST ONE OF THE A LOT OF MY COMMENTS WITH OF OPPOSITION REGARDING HOW TO GET. MY DIFFICULT SEVERAL HUNDRED FACILITIES WILL BE IMPACTED BY A BILL LIKE THIS WE DON'T INCLUDE THEM SO. LIKE YOU'RE LOOKING TO ADDRESS DOESN'T YES MAYBE HOPEFULLY DO IT AND- I RESERVE MY RIGHT BEFORE BUT- AS A- TRYING TO HELP YOU ALONG THE OAKLAND SUPPORT RIGHT NOW. WHEN WE GET RESERVE MY RIGHT FOR THE PEOPLE THANKS THANK YOU CANNOT AND ASSEMBLY. MEMBER MEDINA. STERN TENORS ALL RIGHT REPRESENT RIVERSIDE. THE OF THE NINETY ONE FREEWAY ALSO OF TRAFFIC. US A VERY CONCERNED- WITH THE YOU KNOW THE GOALS OF YOUR BILL- BUT I ALSO SHARE MY OTHER COLLEAGUES- CONCERNED ABOUT- TECH. NEUTRALITY AND I SAID ON THE- TRANSPORTATION. COMMITTEE SO I WILL BE SEEING THIS BILL AGAIN- MIGHT YOU SHARE A LITTLE BIT MORE OF WHAT KIND OF TECHNICALITY. ATTENDANCE POLICY WHEN YOU'RE THE BILL COMES TO. THE TRANSPORTATION. AND YES AND I AND I WOULD I WOULD I WANTED. TO FOR IF THE CHAIR WANTS TO COMMENT ON IT BUT WHAT WHAT WE HAD DISCUSSED IS- THERE'S A- THE BILL ENUMERATES A AN EXECUTIVE ORDER GOAL AROUND CHARGING STE CHARGING STATIONS SINCE TWENTY FIFTY THOUSAND CHARGING STATION BUT IT DOESN'T ENUMERATE. ANY OF THE STATE'S HYDROGEN FUELING STATION CALLS RIGHT SO LET'S GET EXPLICIT ABOUT THOSE AND ADD THOSE IN HERE TOO- THE SAKE LIKE WHAT IT I THINK IT'S- THEIRS TO IT'S A TWO HUNDRED STATION GOAL BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE I THINK IS. WHAT WE SAW ON THE AMENDMENTS FROM THE OPPOSITION. HAPPY TO ADD THAT IT. THE OTHER PIECES JUST TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT WHERE IF THE BILL IS TALKING ABOUT- CHARGING BUT NOT NECESSARILY REFUELLING. RIGHT LIKE GETTING THE LANGUAGE RIGHT SO THAT WE'RE NOT DOING ANY WE'RE NOT UNDER CUTTING AND ANALYSIS SAY OF LIKE HOW TO INNER INTER CONNECTING EEVEE CHARGER BECAUSE THAT'S GONNA BE DIFFERENT PROCESS THAN STREAMLINING A HYDROGEN FUELING STATION BUT JUST THAT. WE'VE GOT SORT OF COROLLARY PIECES TO DEAL WITH THE HYDROGEN SIDE OF IT SO THE LANGUAGE OF THE OPPOSITION AND THE NUMBER AND ALL THAT AND ALL THAT YES THE NUMBER WRITER CHEN WILL BE INCLUDED. YES YES THE NUMBER. I HAVEN'T SEEN ALL THE- DETAILS OF THE REST OF IT LIKE. LINE BY LINE YOU KNOW. GOING THROUGH AND EVERY TIME IT SAYS THE WORD LIKE. STREAMLINING ELECTRIC UTILITY INTERCONNECTION AND INTERNALIZATION PROCESS I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU DO THAT FOR HYDROGEN BUT- WANTED FIGURE THAT LIKE IF WE NEED TO DO WHAT'S- WE MAY NOT STRIKE THAT I THINK THERE IS A PROPOSAL IS SAFE. JUST STRIKE THAT PHRASE MAYBE WE ADD A SECOND PROVISION SAY WE ALSO WANT TO STREAMLINE INTERCONNECTION PROCESS FOR. HYDROGEN REFUELLING SOIT'S NOT ALL IN THE AMENDS THERE MAY BE OTHER STUFF WE'VE GOT TO DO TO LAND THAT. WE'RE IN A BIT OF A TIME CRUNCH THAT'S THE HARD THING HERE SO I DON'T KNOW HOW TO LAND ALL THAT DETAIL HERE TODAY. DEFINITELY THE GOAL. DEFINITELY CONFORMITY AROUND TECHNICALITY JUST EXACTLY WHAT THOSE DETAILS ARE KIND OF I DON'T WANT TO GET AHEAD OF THE CHAIR OR AND- SO. WELL WITH YOUR COMMITMENT THAT YES IT WILL BE HAVING A NEUTRAL AND YES USING THE LEVERAGE OF THE OPPOSITION. YEAH CAN SUPPORT THE BILL YEAH THANK YOU FOR THAT SIGNAL IS A MAN OF COURSE NO THANK YOU FOR THE COMMENT AND- I SPOKE TO MISS COOK ACTUALLY BEFORE THIS HEARING AND I THINK. WE'RE MAKING PROGRESS HERE SO THANKS FOR WAITING AND- YEAH WE DON'T THINK THAT. WITH WANT UNDER ANYTHING THAT IN THE HYDROGEN FUELING SPACE WITH THIS AND WE DON'T WANT TO SAY CALIFORNIA IS NOT COMMITTED TO THAT ANYMORE SO WE'VE GOT A WE'VE GOT GOALS FROM THE IDEA. ANYWAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND YES SIR THANK YOU SENATOR I THINK BOTH FOR. YOUR COMMITMENT TO ENSURING WE'RE ACTUALLY MAKING PROGRESS TOWARDS OUR- AS ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE COLES I THINK IS YOU SAID IN YOUR OPENING COMMENTS IT'S VERY EASY FOR US AS THE LEGISLATURE. TO COME UP WITH. IN A BIG AND BOLD GOALS SEND OUT A BUNCH OF PRESS RELEASES AND PASSED PAT OURSELVES ON THE BACK FOR SOLVING A PROBLEM WE HAVEN'T. ACTUALLY DONE NOTHING. I AND SO I THINK PUTTING IN PLACE. ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES TO ENSURE THAT ARE ACTUALLY MAKING PROGRESS ON THIS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT GOAL. IS CRITICAL. AND I ALSO APPRECIATE THAT YOUR COMMITMENT TO TECHNICALITY. I DO THINK SOME OF THE- REMAINING DETAIL AND THE LANGUAGE. THANK IS. FRANKLY THE RESULT OF THE FACT THAT TO. A LEAD COUNSEL FOR EXAMPLE IN THEIR DRAFT WHEN THEY'RE DRAFTING LANGUAGE THE WORD CHARGING. DOES NOT SEEM TO BE A LOADED WORD. LECTURE IN KIND OF AN INDUSTRY EXPERT SO I. HAD NO THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS AND I'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS WITH THE NUMBER OF FOLKS ON THE COMMITTEE. AND WE APPRECIATE YOUR COMMITMENT TO ENSURING THAT THIS IS ADDRESSED AND- YEAH I THINK. WE CERTAINLY DO RESERVE THE RIGHT TO CALL BACK. ABSOLUTELY SO WITH THAT I ANYTHING FURTHER IN- TO PUSHY THE ENGAGEMENT AND THE C. U. N.
