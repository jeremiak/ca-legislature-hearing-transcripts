INCLUDING FROM THE CURRENT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES GM QUICKLY REVERSED COURSE I INTRODUCED LEGISLATION IN TWENTY TWENTY TO PREVENT SUCH BEHAVIOR IN CALIFORNIA BUT FOUND THAT FEDERAL LAW PREEMPTS OUR ABILITY AS A STATE LEGISLATURE TO CREATE THIS KIND OF PROTECTION.

HOWEVER WE MUST OPPOSE EIGHTY FOUR THIRTY EIGHT FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS. EIGHTY FOUR THIRTY EIGHT ATTEMPTING TO ISOLATE ACROSS THIS BILL CLASSIFIED AND CERTIFICATED EMPLOYEE THE LAPTOP SPECIFICALLY IT IS QUITE DIFFERENT FROM CLASSIFIED CERTIFICATE REDUCTION IS BASED SOLELY ON SENIORITY AND CREDENTIALING FIGURING BECAUSE THIS ISN'T IS TO ENSURE THAT THE RECORD ON SENIORITY AND CREDENTIALING OF FOLLOWED.

AS WE TRY TO PLAN FOR NEXT YEAR OUR STUDENT COUNT IS EXPECT UNEXPECTEDLY DOWN BY FOUR HUNDRED STUDENTS. THE REDUCTION IN OUR STUDENT POPULATION SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTS THE DISTRICT'S BUDGET. WITH SO MANY UNKNOWNS WE DON'T BELIEVE THIS IS THE TIME TO PLACE A NEW MANDATE ON SCHOOL WORK AND ONE THAT IS GOING TO BE DIFFICULT TO MEET. A MARCH FIFTEENTH NOTICES THE BUMPING RIHT OFFICE WILL PLACE MORE STRESS ON EMPLOYEES NOT LESS. IT WEIGHS HEAVILY ON ME TO DISCUSS PEOPLE'S JOBS.

FEAR AND UNCERTAINTY IN TEACHERS AND CREATE DOUBT AMONG STUDENTS M. BLACKLY. LAUGHTER NEVER EVEN. SCHOOL DISTRICT STRIVE TO AVOID LAYING OFF STAFF HOWEVER CAN BE AN OPTION OF LAST RESORT.

COOLEY HI COOLEY AYE O'DONNELL. C. R. TO. THAT'S AVAILABLE TO HEAR BILLS ON CALL THANK YOU THANK YOU NEXT UP IS AB FIFTEEN FIFTY- SOMEONE RIVAS. GOOD AFTERNOON. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS I WANT TO START BY THANKING THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR WORKING WITH ME ONTHIS BILL. AB FIFTEEN FIFTY PROTECTS FACULTY BARGAINING RIGHTS BY ALLOWING FACULTY WHO ARE CURRENTLY IN A BARGAINING UNIT TO REMAIN ELIGIBLE FOR UNION REPRESENTATION EVEN IF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA MOVES THOSE FACULTY POSITIONS TO THE ACADEMIC SENATE THIS MEASURE WOULD ALSO PREVENT THE UC FROM CREATING NEW FACULTY JOB CLASSIFICATIONS IN THE ACADEMIC SENATE THAT ARE VIRTUALLY IDENTICAL TO EXISTING CLASSIFICATIONS CURRENTLY REPRESENTED BY THE UNION. THREE YEARS AGO THE UC OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT REQUESTED THAT THE UC BOARD OF REGENTS MOVE SIX PART TIME NON SENATE FACULTY JOB CLASSIFICATIONS FOR LECTURES INTO THE ACADEMIC SENATE THE SIX PART TIME POSITIONS WERE ACTIVELY COVERED BY A COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT PRIOR TO THE MOVE BUT LOST THEIR UNION REPRESENTATION WHEN MOVED TO THE ACADEMIC SENATE. THIS DECISION WAS CHALLENGED BY THE LABOR UNION THAT REPRESENTED THE PART TIME POSITIONS HOWEVER THE PUBLIC EMPLOYMENT RELATIONS BOARD DECIDED THAT THOSE JOB CLASSIFICATIONS COULD NO LONGER BE UNION REPRESENTED POSITIONS BECAUSE OF RULES UNDER THE HIGHER EDUCATION EMPLOYEE RELATIONS ACT THOUGH THE CLASSIFICATIONS WERE VACANT AT THE TIME THE UC DECIDED TO MOVE THEM IT SETS A DANGEROUS PRECEDENT THAT COULD RESULT IN WORKERS LOSING THEIR UNION REPRESENTATION. FOR EXAMPLE THE UC COULD SEEK TO ELIMINATE AN ENTIRE BARGAINING UNIT BY MOVING ALL OF ITS CONSTITUENT FACULTY JOB TITLES TO THE ACADEMIC SENATE. AB FIFTEEN FIFTY PRESERVES EMPLOYEES RIGHTS BY ENSURING THEY KEEP THEIR UNION REPRESENTATION. TODAY I HAVE. WITH ME TO SUPPORT THE BILL JOHN RENDON UC AFT VICE PRESIDENT FOR LEGISLATION. AND MANUELA BOUCHER FROM THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION. THANK YOU AND FIRST UP IS- JOHN LONDON. THANK YOU TRIMMING COOPER AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE TO ALLOW ME TO SPEAK ON BEHALF OF AB FIFTEEN FIFTY. MY NAME IS JOHN LENNON I TEACH ANCIENT GREEK AND LATIN FOR A LIVING I'M A LECTURER AT UC DAVIS WHERE I'M PROUD OF ONE EITHER UNIVERSITY WHY TEACHING AWARD. I AM ALSO THE VICE PRESIDENT OF LEGISLATION FOR YOU SEE F. T. WE ARE THE UNION THAT REPRESENTS LECTURES AND LIBRARIES ACROSS THE UC. THREE YEARS AGO THE UNIVERSITY MOVES SIX JOB TITLES THAT WERE REPRESENTED BY THE U. C. F. T. INTO THE SENATE. AND EFFECTIVELY STRIPPED THOSE POSITIONS HAVE UNION REPRESENTATION. MERELY BY MOVING THEIR JOB TITLES INTO THE SENATE. ALL THIS BILL DOES IS FIX A FLAW IN HERE IS LANGUAGE THAT ALLOW THE UNIVERSITY TO ENGAGE IN UNION BUSTING TACTICS. THAT'S IT. WORKERS THAT HAVE A UNION SHOULD BE ABLE TO KEEP THEIR UNION IF YOU SEE MOVES THEIR POSITION INTO THE ACADEMIC SENATE. THE UC ARGUMENTS AGAINST THE BILL ARE EITHER MISLEADING OR UNTRUE. FOR EXAMPLE THE NOTION THAT SENATE NON SENATE MEMBERS CANNOT EXIST IN THE SAME UNIT IS FLAWED AND UNFOUNDED. THERE IS NO REASON THAT SOME SUBSECTION THE SENATE SHOULD NOT BE UNIONIZED MANY INSTITUTIONS HAVE DIFFERENT OR BIFURCATE TARGETING TARGETING IT'S AN THEM. ALSO JUST BECAUSE THE SENATE MEMBERS CONFORMING TO UNION UNDER EXISTING LAW. DOES NOT MEAN IT'S APPROPRIATE FOR THE UC TO UNILATERALLY ELIMINATE UNION REPRESENTATION FOR WORKERS ALREADY IN A UNION. LASTLY THE BILL HAS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO LIMIT THE UC'S ABILITY TO MOVE EXISTING POSITIONS INTO THE ACADEMIC SENATE. AB FIFTEEN FIFTY SIMPLY SIX TO ALLOW REPRESENTED JOB TITLES THERE MOVED TO THE SENATE TO RETAIN THEIR UNION REPRESENTATION. I URGE A YES VOTE ON AB FIFTEEN FIFTY THANK YOU O MUCH THANK YOU AND THAT'S WERE FROM WHEN MANUELA COMMITTEE CANTINA. GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS NOT ALLOWED TO SAY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION PROUD TO BE HERE BECAUSE BALK AT THE THOUGHT. AB FIFTEEN FIFTY SIMPLY IN CONCERN ABOUT FACULTY MEMBERS AT THE UC RETAINER UNION REPRESENTATION. REGARDLESS OF ANY UNILATERAL ACTION TAKEN BY THE UNIVERSITY. THROUGHOUT OUR COUNTRY'S HISTORY UNIONS HAVE BEEN PIVOTAL TO ENSURE SAFE WORKING CONDITIONS FAIR WAGES AND BENEFITS FOR EMPLOYEES AND CONDUCTED BY ALLIED WITH MANAGEMENT. I NEED THE TUITION WHICH LEADS TO AN EMPLOYEE'S LOTS OF UNION REPRESENTATION ARE BARGAINING POWER REALLY IMPACTS THE MEMBERS WELL BEING AND IT'S UNACCEPTABLE. AB THIRTEEN FIFTY THE ISSUER SIMPLE FACULTY MEMBERS WHO HAVE NO INPUT OVER THE MEMBERSHIP OF THE ACADEMIC SENATE SHOULD NOT LOSE THEIR UNION MEMBERSHIP IN A POSITION FOR. VOTED FOR AN ELECTED TO BE MEMBERS OF THE ONLY BASED ON THE OPINIONS OF THE FLEET. EIGHTY FIFTEEN FIFTY DOES NOT IMPACT THE YOU CAN ABILITY TO ELECT THE MEMBERSHIP OF THE ACADEMIC SENATE BUT MERELY ENSURE THAT ANY CLASSIFICATION MOVED INTO THE SENATE WILL RETAIN THEIR PREVIOUS UNION REPRESENTATION. THUS ENSURING THAT THE FACULTY MEMBERS REMAIN COVERED BY THEIR COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT AND UNDER THE PROTECTION OF THEIR UNION. WE THANK ASSEMBLYWOMAN REEBOK FOR LEADERSHIP AND- JERRY AFTER EIGHTY FIFTEEN FIFTY THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER MONEY FORCE RON AB FIFTEEN FIFTY ONE WITNESSES SUPPORT.

AND I'M IN TRONG THE COURT AB. FIFTEEN FIFTY. AT THE TIME THERE'S NO OTHER THAN Q. THANK YOU NEXT REMOVED WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION OF AB FIFTEEN FIFTY. AND WE DON'T HAVE ANY PRIMARY WOULDN'T WE DEPARTMENT SOME SORRY FIRST UP IS MICHAEL BEDARD. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS MICHAEL THE DART ON BEHALF OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT. YOU STILL PAY RESPECT RESPECTFULLY OPPOSES AB FIFTEEN FIFTY THE BILL FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGES THE ACADEMIC SENATE. WHICH IS A CRITICAL PART IN THE SHORT GOVERNANCE MODEL FOR MANAGEMENT AND ADMINISTRATION OF THE UNIVERSITY. THE BILL AS ALSO UNNECESSARY SENATE MEMBERS CAN ALREADY UNIONIZED IN FACT THE SANTA CRUZ FACULTY ASSOCIATION HAS REPRESENTED MEMBERS OF THE UC SANTA CRUZ ACADEMIC SENATE FOR MORE THAN TWENTY YEARS. YOU SEE THE PROUD UNION EMPLOYER AND DOES NOT ENGAGE IN UNION BUSTING TACTICS. BUT SENATE FACULTY AND NON SENATE FACULTY HAVE DIFFERENT INTERESTS AND VERY DIFFERENT ROLES WITHIN THE UNIVERSITY. THAT IS WHY THE ONLY APPROPRIATE BARGAINING UNITS FOR SENATE MEMBERS. IS ONE WHERE OTHER SENATE MEMBERS ARE IN ONLY SENATE MEMBERS. THIS BILL FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGES THAT. IF YOU'LL PAY AGAIN IS NOT OPPOSED TO AN ORGANIZED TO REPRESENT ACADEMIC SENATE. WE ARE OPPOSED TO BARGAINING UNITS THAT BLAND BUT DIFFERENT FUNCTION THAN INTEREST THE SENATE AND NON SENATE MEMBERS. THE CURRENT LAW IS SUFFICIENT TO GRANT SENATE MEMBERS BARGAINING RIGHTS AND AB FIFTEEN FIFTY UNNECESSARY CHANGES THAT. IN A WAY THAT IS DETRIMENTAL TO THE VALUE ADDED TO THE UNIVERSITY BY THE ACADEMIC SENATE. AND UNDERMINES THE VALUE OF UC'S SHORT GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE. I BELIEVE ON THE PHONE ALSO IS MERRY GOV AND THE CHAIR OF THE UC ACADEMIC SENATE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT UP IS MARIE WALDRON. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TALK WITH YOU TODAY MY NAME IS MERRY LEVINE AND I'VE BEEN A PROFESSOR OF PSYCHOLOGY AT UC RIVERSIDE FOR CLOSE TO THIRTY YEARS I AM THE CURRENT CHAIR OF THE UC ACADEMIC SENATE. I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE SENATE TO ASK YOU TO OPPOSE AB FIFTEEN FIFTY. AB FIFTEEN FIFTY REQUIRED SIX NEW MEMBERS OF THE ACADEMIC SENATE MAINTAIN MEMBERSHIP IN THEIR PRIOR NON ACADEMIC SENATE BARGAINING UNIT. THIS ARRANGEMENT IS NOT APPROPRIATE BECAUSE IT WOULD POTENTIALLY CAUSE ACADEMIC SENATE FACULTY WHO MANAGE AND SUPERVISE INSTRUCTORS TO BE REPRESENTED ALONGSIDE THE SAME NON ACADEMIC SENATE INSTRUCTORS. THE SENATE GREATLY VALUES THE WORK INSTRUCTORS DO BUT INSTRUCTORS SERVE A DIFFERENT FUNCTION AT THE UNIVERSITIES AND ACADEMIC SENATE FACULTY. RESPONSIBILITIES OF INSTRUCTORS IS FOCUSED ON TEACHING. ACADEMIC SENATE FACULTY HAVE OBLIGATIONS OF TEACHING RESEARCH AND SERVICE AND IMPORTANTLY OF HELPING TO MANAGE THE UNIVERSITY OF SHARED GOVERNANCE. AND AS MY COLLEAGUE FROM THE GOP MENTIONED THE ACADEMIC SENATE CAN ALREADY UNIONIZED AND ALREADY HAS EACH TO SANTA CRUZ. FINALLY A. B. FIFTEEN FIFTY WOULD PROHIBIT THE ACADEMIC SENATE FROM EXTENDING SENATE MEMBERSHIP TO ANYONE WITH SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR DUTIES AS REPRESENTED ACADEMIC EMPLOYEES. THIS IS PUT THIS IN PERMITTED. THE SENATE COULD NOT MODIFY ELIGIBILITY FOR MEMBERSHIP IN THE FUTURE FOR EXAMPLE TO SUPPORT FACULTY YOU SEEK TO ADJUST THEIR WORK LIFE BALANCE. RECEIVE CALIFORNIA IS PROUD TO BE PART OF THE FINEST SYSTEM OF PUBLIC HIGHER EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES. BUT THIS BILL ENDANGERS THE ABILITY OF THE ACADEMIC SENATE BACK ULTI TO PARTICIPATE IN SHARED GOVERNANCE WHICH UNDERLIES THE HIGH LEVEL OF TEACHING RESEARCH AND SERVICE THAT IS CARRIED OUT BY SENATE FACULTY. AND IS CRITICAL TO THE ECONOMY AND WELL BEING OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THE UC ACADEMIC SENATE URGES YOU TO VOTE NO ON A. B. FIFTEEN FIFTY THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT TO MOVE TO WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION HERE IN THE HEARING ROOM. I DON'T SEE ANY- ONE THIS IS AN OPPOSITION VIA REMOTE VIDEO STATION. I SEE NONE NEXT WE'LL DO IT THIS IS NOT POSITION ON THE PHONE LINE OPERATOR. IT WAS TO COME IN OPPOSITION IN A PRESS ONE UNTIL ABOUT THIS TIME. THE GOVERNMENT. I CAN'T. WE HAVE NO ONE IN Q. THANK YOU FOR GOING TO BRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS TO THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS. HEARING AND SEEING THEM- MISS REAVIS WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE ON YOUR BILL. THANK YOU I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. AND WE WILL HAVE A MOTION AT SOLDIER THE MOTION THE SECOND. MISTER CALDERON MAKES MOTION MR VOEPEL MAKES A SECOND- MADAM SECRETARY CAN CALL THE ROLL PLEASE. THE MOTION IS THE PAST AND BE RE REFER TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS COOPER HI COOPER AYE VOEPEL.

WE'RE NOT MOVING TO THE NEXT LEVEL IN JUST STARTING WITH A. B. FIVE FIVE ONE ASSEMBLY MEMBER RODRIGUEZ YOU MAY PRESENT YOUR BILL ALREADY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN BURR'S THANK FOR OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT THIS BILL TODAY. AB FIVE FIVE ONE WOULD AUTHORIZE CAL STIRS TO OFFER AND ACCEPT CONTRIBUTIONS FOR TRADITIONAL TAX DEFERRED IRA AND ROTH IRA PLANS. INCLUDING ROLLOVER FROM ANY ELIGIBLE RETIREMENT PLAN INTO THOSE ARE A PLANTS. THE BILL WOULD ENABLE WILL ENABLE CAL STIRS TO RECEIVE CONTRIBUTIONS FROM ELIGIBLE MEMBERS FORMER OUTDOOR MEMBERS WHO ARE RETIRED AND THEIR SPOUSES FOR THE IRA IRA PLANS. CULTURES WILL CONTINUE TO ENCOURAGE MEMBERS TO COMPARE PRODUCTS AND CHOOSE WHAT THEY- WANT FOR THE FINANCIAL ADVISER BELIEVES IS BEST FOR THEIR NEEDS. WITH ME TODAY PROVIDE TESTIMONY IS MERRY AND ACTUALLY DIRECTOR OF GOVERNMENT RELATIONS WITH CHARACTERS AND JENNIFER BAKER. LEGISLATIVE ADVOCATE FOR THE CALIFORNIA RETIRED TEACHERS ASSOCIATION. THANK YOU THREE TO MOVE THE WITNESSES AND SUPPORT AND FIRST UP IS MARYANNE ASHLEY. HI GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS THIS IS MERION ASHLEY WITH THE CALIFORNIA STATE TEACHERS RETIREMENT SYSTEM CHARACTERS IS THE SPONSOR OF THE MEASURE. WE WANT TO THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER RODRIGUEZ FOR OFFERING THIS IMPORTANT BILL THAT WILL ASSIST CALIFORNIA'S EDUCATORS WITH THEIR SUPPLEMENTAL RETIREMENT SAVINGS OPTIONS AND ALSO THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER COOLEY AT THE COLDWATER. CHARACTERS MISSION IS SECURING THE FINANCIAL FUTURE ENTERTAINING THE TRUST OF CALIFORNIA EDUCATORS AND TO ACCOMPLISH THIS WE OFFER HYBRID RETIREMENT SYSTEM WITH DEFINED BENEFIT CASH BALANCE AND VOLUNTARY DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS. AND WHILE THE DEFINED BENEFIT PLAN IS A GREAT BENEFIT FOR CALIFORNIA TEACHERS IT IS WITH IT EXCUSE ME IS A QUICK SPECTER TO ONLY REPLACE ABOUT 50% OF OUR MEMBERS. AND IF THE CAREER EARNING. AND ADDITION CALIFORNIA PUBLIC EDUCATORS DO NOT CONTRIBUTE TO SOCIAL SECURITY. SO THEY WILL NOT RECEIVE A FOCAL SECURITY BENEFIT PRODUCT CHARACTERS COVERED EMPLOYMENT. THAT'S CHARACTERS RECOGNIZES THE IMPORTANCE FOR OUR MEMBERS TO HELP SUPPLEMENTAL RETIREMENT SAVINGS AND WE REALLY ENCOURAGE OUR MEMBERS TO PARTICIPATE IN A SUPPLEMENTAL RETIREMENT SAVINGS PLAN. CURRENTLY CHARACTERS OFFERS FOR A THREE D. PARK AT THE SEVENTY ROXBORO THREE B. AND RAPPORT FIFTY SEVENTY PLANTS WHAT POKOK BE STRUCTURED. AND UNLIKE OTHER INSTITUTIONS WE DO NOT CHARGE COMMISSION AND THERE ARE NO PENALTIES OR SURRENDER CHARGES IF A PARTICIPANT WANTS TO LEAVE OUR PROGRAM. AND ROLLOVER OR EXCHANGE THEIR FUNDS ELSEWHERE. WE ALSO HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO OFFER A ROTH IRA. HOWEVER WHAT FINDING IS THAT EVERY MONTH WE HAVE ANYWHERE FROM FIFTY TO A HUNDRED MEMBERS ASKING ABOUT OUR OPPORTUNITIES TO CONTRIBUTE OR ROLL OVER TO A CHARACTERS IRA. FIXES WHY WE'RE SPEAKING THAT LEGISLATION RESPOND FOR MEMBERS AND TO HELP THEM MEET THEIR RETIREMENT SAVINGS ALL. INTENT OF THE CHARACTERS ARE RIGHT IF NOT FOR PARTICIPANTS TO USE IN LIEU OF A FOUR OH THREE B. R. FOR FIFTY SEVEN PLANS WE'RE VERY WELL AWARE OF SOME OF THE ADVANTAGES. OF SOME PLANTS. BUT RATHER IT IS MEANT TO AUGMENT THE PLAN. CHARACTERS THE RETIREMENT. PLAN PARTICIPANTS AND OUR MEMBERS WITH ONE ON ONE APPOINTMENT. WEBINARS WORKSHOPS VIDEOS. AND PRINT MATERIALS. SO THAT OUR MEMBERS AND PARTICIPANTS ARE ABLE TO GET ASSISTANCE AND EDUCATION REGARDING THE SAVINGS OPTIONS WE OFFER. AND THE BENEFITS THAT EACH TYPE OF PLAN. OF THE DAY ALONG WITH THE HELP OF BURKE FINANCIAL ADVISORS. CAN MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS AND CHOOSE A PLAN THAT BEST SUITS THEIR RETIREMENT NEEDS AND GOALS. IF A CHARACTERS TO A TRADITION IRA WILL NOT ELIMINATE A NUMBER ABILITY TO ENROLL IN A FOUR OH THREE B. OR FOUR FIFTY SEVEN PLAN. IT WILL BE A MEANS FOR CAL STARS PROVIDES THE SAME LOW COST SERVICES OFFERED VIA THE CHARACTERS FOR A THREE D. AND FOUR FIFTY SEVEN PLAN. TO THOSE MEMBERS WHO ARE INTERESTED IN AND ASKING FOR A CALPERS FIVE OPTION FOR CONTRIBUTION OR ROLLOVER PURPOSES. CHAPTER THE CALL WE DEDICATED THE SECURING THE FINANCIAL FUTURE OF OUR MEMBERS AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU. OUR NEXT WITNESS IS PREFERRED BAKER. IT HAPPENED THIS IS JENNIFER BAKER AND I'M REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA RETIRED TEACHERS ASSOCIATION WHO PLEASED TO SUPPORT THIS IMPORTANT MEASURE WHICH PROVIDES AN ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT TOOL FOR TEACHERS. BY PROVIDING TEACHERS WITH BOTH THE OPTION OF CHOOSING AN IRA AS WELL AS THE NOCTIVA THIS MEASURE WOULD ALLOW TEACHERS THE ABILITY TO CHOOSE ADDITIONAL OPTIONS FOR DIVERSE THAT FIND THEIR LONG TERM RETIREMENT STATING. AB FIVE FIFTY ONE WOULD ALSO ALLOW ROLLOVER ALLOWING RETIREES TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF DIFFERENT ADDITIONAL OPTIONS. THE COST OF RETIREMENT- INCREASING MAKING IT MORE IMPORTANT FOR TEACHERS TO HAVE ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT VEHICLES PARTICULARLY IN LIGHT OF THE FACT THAT BABY BOOMERS ARE VULNERABLE TO FEDERAL SOCIAL SECURITY ASSETS. WHICH ARE SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCING THE AMOUNT OF SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS THAT EDUCATORS STATE IN TWO. THOUSAND FORTUNATE THAT THOSE IN THE FINANCIAL SECTOR ARE TRYING TO FIGHT FOR COMPETITION INSTEAD OF FOCUSING ON IMPROVING THEIR OWN PRODUCT TO MAKE THEMSELVES MORE ATTRACTIVE TO OUR MEMBERS. I FALLING COMP MAY BE GOOD FOR WEALTHY WALL STREET INVESTORS BUT OUR FOCUS IS ON WHICH GOOD FOR TEACHERS RETIREMENT SECURITY. RIDING THE TOOL TEACHERS AND RETIRED TEACHERS NEED TO HAVE A MORE SECURE RETIREMENT IT'S EXACTLY WHAT THEY NEED RIGHT NOW PARTICULARLY IN LIGHT OF THE FACT THAT THE LARGEST GROWING SEGMENT OF THE POPULATION IS THE SENIOR POPULATION. IF CURRENT AND FUTURE SENIOR KERR ECONOMICALLY VULNERABLE IT WILL HAVE AN ECONOMIC DRAG ON CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY. THIS SIMPLE BUT EFFECTIVE MEASURE IT'S FORWARD THINKING AND WILL ENSURE CALIFORNIA'S RETIRED TEACHERS WILL BE ABLE TO ENSURE THEIR OWN RETIREMENT SECURITY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA RETIRED TEACHERS ASSOCIATION I URGE YOUR SUPPORT. AND EIGHTY FIVE FIFTY ONE. THANK YOU MAKES WE MOVED IT WOULDN'T SUPPORT HERE IN THE HEARING ROOM. ANYONE IS IN SUPPORT. SINGA WOULD WITNESSES SUPPORT ON THE REMOTE VIDEO STATION. LCDA WILL MOVE AWARENESS IS ON THE PHONE WHO WERE IN SUPPORT OPERATOR. WHICH TO ME COMING INTO PORT YOU MAY PRESS ONE ZERO AT THIS TIME. AND WHAT SERVICES FOR AB FIVE FIVE ONE. AND THERE'S NO WINNING Q. OKAY THANK YOU REMOVED WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. FIRST UP IS GEORGE MILLER. MR MILLER. MR CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS GEORGE MILLER ON BEHALF OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY OF PENSION PROFESSIONALS AND ACTUARIES AN AFFILIATE OF THE AMERICAN RETIREMENT ASSOCIATION WITH MORE THAN THREE THOUSAND MEMBERS IN CALIFORNIA. OR BY CONSULTING AND ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES TO EMPLOYEES EMPLOYERS AND SPONSORS OF RETIREMENT PLANS. IS ON THEIR BEHALF THE I MUST RESPECTFULLY CLOSE EIGHT FIVE FIVE ONE TODAY. AB FIVE FIVE ONE WHAT SENSUALLY ALLOWS TERRORISTS TO BE A LEAD GENERATOR FOR A WALL STREET CREATED FINANCIAL SERVICES FIRM. BOY NOT UNLIKE ANY OF OUR OTHER MEMBERS. THE PBLIC EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS IN CALIFORNIA CURRENTLY HAVE ACCESS TO HIGH QUALITY LOW COST OPTIONS TO SAVE FOR RETIREMENT TO WORK PLACE FOR A THREE D. AND FOUR FIFTY SEVEN BASED SOLUTIONS WHICH ARE SUPERIOR IN MANY WAYS. TO INVESTING IN IRIS IN ADDITION CALIFORNIA'S PRIVATE SECTOR RETIREMENT INDUSTRY OFFERS ANY EMPLOYEE WORKING ON PUBLIC EDUCATION RESOURCES TO CREATE ADDITIONAL RETIREMENT COVERAGE THROUGH AN IRA. FOR THESE REASONS WE MUST RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE AB FIVE FIVE ONE. MISTER CHAIRMAN I YIELD THE BALANCE OF MY TIME IF THERE'S ANY TO MISTER NORWOOD THANK YOU JOHN NORWOOD'S OF NEXT. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS JOHN NORWOOD ON BEHALF OF AMERICAN FIDELITY INSURANCE GROUP- WE HAVE A NUMBER OF CONCERNS WITH THIS BILL THIS WOULD BE THE FIRST TIME THIS FIRST SERVICE WOULD BE AUTHORIZED TO OFFER PRODUCTS TO NON TEACHERS THE BILL ALLOWS JURORS TO OFFER PRODUCTS. AND I REPEAL PLANS INDEPENDENT I REPLY AND TO- TEACHERS FORMER TEACHERS AND ASSOCIATED PERSONNEL AND SPOUSES OF TEACHERS ASSOCIATION PERSONNEL AND FORMER TEACHER TEACHERS- WE REALLY QUESTION THE JUSTIFICATION FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO INNER. WHAT IS A VERY COMPETITIVE FIELD CURRENTLY FOR INDIVIDUAL IRA PLANS THAT IS WELL SERVED BY FINANCIAL SERVICES FIRMS THAT OFFER EVERYTHING FROM THE LOWEST COST PLANS TO FINANCIAL SERVICES ESPECIALLY WHERE THERE IS NO ADMINISTRATIVE DUTIES. PRIVATE PLANS FOR. THE EMPLOYER STIRRERS REALLY STANDS IN THE PLACE OF THE SCHOOL DISTRICT EMPLOYER IN OFFERING RETIREMENT PLANS. THERE ARE PLAN LEVEL RULES THAT GOVERNED THE ADMINISTRATION OF PRE TAX SALARY DEFERRED PLANS LIKE PENSIONS FOUR THREE B. AND FOUR FIFTY SEVEN PROGRAMS THESE PLANS ARE TO BE ADMINISTERED BY THE EMPLOYER. IN THESE CASES. pTO DICTATE THE PRODUCTS TO BE OFFERED AND WHO'S GOING TO OFFER THEM BECAUSE THEY EITHER HAVE THE EITHER MATCH CONTRIBUTIONS OR THEY HAVE A DUTY UNDER FEDERAL LAW TO ADMINISTER THE PLANTS. BUT I RISEN ROTH IRAS ALL DIFFERENT ANIMAL- THEY ARE INDIVIDUAL PLANS FUNDED WITH AFTER TAX DOLLARS OF THE EMPLOYEE ONLY THERE'S NO INVOLVEMENT OF THE EMPLOYER AND SUCH PLANS AND THERE'S NO. REQUIREMENT OR MINISTRY REQUIREMENTS ON THE EMPLOYER. I THINK WE ALL SHARE THE CONCERN THE TEACHERS GET THE BEST POSSIBLE ADVICE AND ARE OFFERED A FULL GAMUT OF FINANCIAL PRODUCTS THERE ARE APPROPRIATE FOR A SUCCESSFUL RETIREMENT. FINANCIAL SERVICES FIRMS CAN OFFER A FULL ARRAY OF THESE SERVICES. BUT WE FEEL THAT. AB FIVE FIVE ONE PROVIDE STIRRERS WHO WILL BE OFFERING PROPRIETARY PRODUCTS THROUGH WHAT IS LIKELY A LIMITED BROKER DEALER A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE TO USE WAGE SLOTS. AND THEIR LONG TERM RELATIONSHIP TO TEACH WITH TEACHERS TO OFFER LIMITED PRODUCTS THAT MIGHT OR MIGHT NOT E IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE TEACHER AND THESE ASSOCIATED. PERSONNEL WHEN THEY'RE TRYING TO DETERMINE HOW TO USE THEIR FUNDS OR THAT OF THEIR SPOUSE OR- THEIR PARTNERS FILES- LASTLY FEDERAL REGULATORS HAVE DEVELOPED A WHOLE LITANY OF GUIDELINES DUE DILIGENCE. AND DISCLOSURES INCLUDING DISCLOSURE OF THIRD PARTY RELATIONSHIPS. THESE ARE MANDATED SPECIFICALLY FOR IRAS AND ROTH IRAS IT'S UNCLEAR IN THIS BILL. ARE WHETHER THESE APPLY DESTROYERS AND THEIR CHOSEN ADMINISTRATOR. OUR BROKERS ARE HOLD LICENCES BY INSURANCE IS USUALLY HOLD INSURANCE IS KERRY LICENSES AND MUST FOLLOW THESE GUIDELINES RULES. AND FULL DISCLOSURES AND ARE SUBJECT TO ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS IF THEY DIDN'T. SO FOR THE THREE- RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE THE BILL I DO WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR. AND HIS STAFF FOR THEIR TIME WE'VE HAD SEVERAL DISCUSSIONS WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THEM THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. AND MORE WITNESSES IN THE HEARING ROOM. THAT OPPOSITION THIS BILL.

OTHER PERSONAL FINANCIAL SITUATION OF WORKERS SINCE THAT TIME HAS GOTTEN WORSE NOT BETTER FOR MOST. IT WOULD MAKE ABSOLUTELY NO SENSE FOR ME NOT SUPPORTED TODAY. S. SECONDLY THE AVERAGE DEFINED BENEFIT FOR CALPERS RETIREE IS 50% OF THEIR WORKING WAGE. TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE TEACHERS NOT RECEIVES ALSO CARRY LIKE MOST RETIREES DO. THE FIRM BELIEVER IN A DEFINED BENEFIT PROGRAM AS WELL AS OTHEREMPLOYEE INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR PUBLIC EMPLOYEES. EDUCATORS ARE INTELLIGENT. I BELIEVE THEY CAN MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS ON INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES ARE BEST FOR THEM.

A. B. SIX FIFTEEN WITH SIMPLY PROVIDE MINIMUM PLAN RIGHTS TO MEDICAL AND DENTAL PLACE TO WORK FOR A HIGHER EDUCATION EMPLOYER. THESE EMPLOYEES WHO WORK IN HIGHER EDUCATION TO GET THE SKILLS NECESSARY FOR LIFE SCENES ARE NOT AFFORDED BASIC RIGHTS REGARDING DISCIPLINE OR TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT THAT COULD NEGATIVELY. NEGATIVELY IMPACT. IMPACT FUTURE EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES DUE TO SOMETHING MINOR THAT ARE RELATED TO. CLINICAL PRACTICE OR ACADEMICS. BECAUSE OF THE ONGOING CRISIS IN HEALTHCARE TODAY WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT MINOR SUBJECTIVE DECISIONS DON'T HARM THE FUTURE EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES. OF PROFESSIONALS THAT WE DESPERATELY NEED TODAY. ALL IN THE TOUGH FIGHT RESPOND TO TECHNICAL QUESTIONS ARE MATT LATE WITH S. A. U. AND DR ANNA YEAH. FIRST UP IS MET LATE WEDNESDAY. HELLO THIS IS NOT A J. ON BEHALF OF AS YOU CALIFORNIA AND WE ARE THE PROUD SPONSOR OF EIGHTY SIX FIFTEEN SO THE INDIVIDUALS WHO'VE GONE THROUGH YEARS OF MEDICAL TRAINING OFTEN EXPERIENCING SIGNIFICANT THAT ARE AND ARE NOW IN THEIR RESIDENCY PROGRAM HAVE ACCESS TO BASIC DUE PROCESS RIGHTS. ALL OTHER EMPLOYEES AT THE UC HOP ACCESS TO THESE BASIC RIGHTS TO ENSURE THAT DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS ARE JUDICATA BY NEUTRAL THIRD PARTY ARBITERS- THESE ARBITRATORS ARE IMPORTANT BACKSTOPS ENSURE THAT EMPLOYEES CAREER IS NOT DERAILED DUE TO A DISAGREEMENT WITH THEIR EMPLOYER. PROGRAM MISTER OFTEN OFTEN CITE THE BIG EXPANSIVE TURN UNPROFESSIONAL TO TAKE ACTIONS AGAINST RESIDENTS WHO SPEAK UP ABOUT ISSUES RELATED TO PATIENT CARE MORE FACE SAFETY ISSUES. THE VISION MUST BE ABLE TO SPEAK UP FOR THEIR PATIENCE ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY DISAGREE WITH THEIR PROGRAM MINISTRY- WITHOUT FEAR THAT DOING SO WILL ENDANGER THEIR YEARS OF WORK AND THEIR FUTURE LIVELIHOOD. FORT WAYNE PROCESS RIGHTS FOR RESIDENT PHYSICIANS IS NOT A NEW CONCEPT- YEAH YOU HAD TO PROCESS RIGHT INCREASE AT FIFTY SIX OTHER RESIDENCY PROGRAMS NATIONALLY INCLUDING. ONE AT NINE YOU SEE HOSPITALS- IN CALIFORNIA. THERE IS A STANDARD THIS IS A STANDARD PRACTICE TO ADDRESS LABOR DISPUTES- AND IN FACT A NEUTRAL THIRD PARTY FACT FINDER RECENTLY FOUND THAT- THE UC SHOULD GIVE THESE RIGHTS TO RESIDENTS FROM. THIS INCLUDING ALL SAY THAT WE ARE CONTINUING TO HAVE ONGOING PRODUCTIVE CONVERSATIONS WITH OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL BY ENSURING THAT RESIDENTS HAVE THE BASIC DUE PROCESS RIGHTS IS CRITICAL TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE BROUGHT AND SHOW RESIDENTS CAN SPEAK UP FOR THEMSELVES AND THEIR PATIENTS. WITHOUT FEAR OF RETALIATION FROM THEIR EMPLOYER I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE BUT THANK YOU NEXUS DOCTOR ON A YACHT. HELLO I'M DR ANNA YAP THE RESIDENTS OF THE XIN AT UCLA. I'VE GONE THROUGH FOUR YEARS OF UNDERGRAD IN FOUR YEARS OF MEDICAL SCHOOL AND I AM NOW IN MY THIRD YEAR PRESIDENCY. UNLIKE MOST RESIDENTS I HAVE ABOUT TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS IN MEDICAL SCHOOL THAT. THING RESIDENCIA HAVE MALE PATIENT LOAD OF WORK AT THE FRONT LINE POSITION AS I BECOME AN EXPERT IN MY FIELD BEFORE I COME FULLY BOARD CERTIFIED. AS LEARNERS THE RESIDENTS ARE PROTECTED WOULD YOU PROCESS WHEN IT COMES THE ACADEMIC AND CLINICAL MATTERS HOWEVER AS EMPLOYEES WHO NEED TO FINISH RESIDENCY WHICH CAN LAST ANYWHERE FROM THREE NINE YEARS. TO BECOME A FULLY BOARD CERTIFIED PHYSICIAN OUR ENTIRE MEDICAL COULD BE LOST BASED ON THE OPINION OF ONE PERSON THINKING WHERE I'M PROFESSIONAL. WITHOUT DUE PROCESS IN THE UC SYSTEM. PROFESSIONALISM IS OFTEN TAINTED WITH BIAS DISPROPORTIONATELY WEAPONIZED AGAINST FEMALE PHYSICIANS AND PHYSICIANS OF COLOR AND BECAUSE IT CAN BE USED AGAINST US BUT WE ADVOCATE. TO CREATE A MEDICINE TO BECOME A PHYSICIAN WE SUCH INDIVIDUAL BECAUSE GOOD AT FOLLOWING DIRECTIONS. AND DON'T NECESSARILY MAKE WEIGHT. AND DURING CODE THIS IS PLAINLY OBVIOUS CONFOUND OUR DUTY POSITIONS ACROSS THE NATION FIRED FOR SPEAKING UP AND STATING THAT THEY DID NOT HAVE ENOUGH PP. THAT'S WHY WE'RE SPONSORING EIGHTY SIX ONE FIVE. SO THAT RESIDENTS IN THE UC SYSTEM CANNOT BASIC DUE PROCESS WHEN IT COMES TO TERMINATION FOR REASONS OF PROFESSIONALISM NON. ACADEMIC NON CLINICAL. SO I EIGHTY SIX FUNDS. WOULD US THE TO UP AND PATIENT AB. AND HOW CAPITA WITHOUT THE THREAT OF. OUR ENTIRE MY CAREER. I THINK THE MEDICINE IS. MORE WOMEN AND PEOPLE OF COLOR ARE JOINING THE OF THE- ONE. BUT YOU IS SLOW AND ONE OF THE HURDLES WE FACE IS BEING DEEMED UNPROFESSIONAL AND THE EYES OF THOSE WHO HAVE SO MUCH POWER OVER OUR FUTURE.

NO SIGNIFICANT DISCIPLINE OR TERMINATION ACTION IS MADE BY ONE IT PROVIDES ARE ALONE. HOWEVER THE UNIVERSITY NEEDS TO ENSURE A PHYSICIAN EDUCATOR AND DISCIPLINE WHEN NECESSARY.

NEVERTHELESS WE'RE HOPEFUL WE CAN CLARIFY ACADEMIC AND CLINICAL MATTERS IN THE BILL TO RESOLVE OUR CONCERNS.

A CLASS OF PENSION AND RETIREE WITH A HI PENSION BENEFIT THIS IS IT WOULD ALLOW A JUDGE. AND THE JUDGE RETIREMENT SYSTEMS TENSIONS TO THE OTHER INCOME LIMIT RETESTED EACH YEAR. UNDER FEDERAL RULES THERE'S A LOT THERE'S A CAP ON HOW BIG A PINCH YOU CAN BE. R. BUT THAT GETS ADJUSTED UNDER A CAP BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT REGULAR BASIS. OTHER RETIREES IN CALIFORNIA WHO ARE ELIGIBLE FOR A HIGHER PENSION BECAUSE THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THEIR CAREER. CAN GET THEIR CAP. RETESTED UNDER THIS FEDERAL AND IN SMALL WAYS RECOUP SOME OF THEIR EARLIER PAYMENTS AT A PENSION. THIS SIMPLY EXTENDS IT TO JUDGES IN FOR VARIETY REASONS A SITTING JUDGE IN CALIFORNIA WHO LONGER WILL WORK FOR STATE AGENCY. AND IT WAS IN THE JUDGE RETURNS US NUMBER ONE. AND JUDGES FOR TAXES IN ORDER TO THIS WILL HELP OF IS A VERY NARROW BUT ITS FAIRNESS AND IT'S NOT ACTUALLY BREAKING NEW GROUND. TO EXTEND EXISTING LAW TO THIS CLASS OF JUDGES ORIGINAL VOTE.

WELL THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS MIKE BELOW FOR THE CALIFORNIA JUDGES ASSOCIATION I'D LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE CONSULTANT THIS IS A KIND OF A COMPLICATED LITTLE ISSUE- AND- HE HELPED US A LOT- VERY VERY BRIEFLY THIS BILL DOES NO CHANGE AT ALL TO WHAT A JUDGE EARNS UNDER THE RETIREMENT PLAN- YOU KNOW YOU ARE PROMISED A CERTAIN AMOUNT UNDER THE PLAN. BUT IF YOU HIT THE FEDERAL CAPS IN INTERNAL REVENUE CODE SECTION FOR FIFTEEN YOU MAY NOT GET WHAT YOU WERE PROMISED. SO YOU WOULD TAKE A HIT YOU WOULD ACTUALLY FOR FIT SOME OF YOUR BENEFITS. WELL THAT FEDERAL LIMIT GOES UP FROM TIME TO TIME AND SO THE QUESTION IS CAN YOUR AMOUNT GO UP WHEN THE FEDERAL LIMIT INCREASES WELL FOR ALL OTHER STATE EMPLOYEES IT DOES BUT I THINK IT'S JUST A QUIRK IN THE LAW I DON'T THINK THERE WAS ANY POLICY REASON. FOR EXCLUDING JUDGES SO ALL IT DOES IS ALLOW IT JUDGE TO GET MORE OF WHAT THE PROGRAM PROMISED THEM UNDER THE RETIREMENT LAW- SO AT THE MR COOLEY IS RIGHT IS VERY VERY NARROW AND WE WOULD ASK FOR AND I THOUGHT.

BY LAW THE SERVICE WOMEN AND MEN OUR SCHOOLS BE MADE WHOLE BY THE COMPENSATION PEOPLE THEIR CIVILIAN EMPLOYMENT THIS WAS NOT HOW IT TRANSPIRED IN THE PANDEMIC OF COVERT- OF LACK OF CLARITY IN EXISTING LAW. MANY OF OUR SERVICE WOMEN IN MEN'S PAY WAS DELAYED IN SOME CASES UP TO ALMOST A YEAR. IT IS UNTHINKABLE THAT WE CALL THESE FIVE PEOPLE TO SERVICE.

THIS BILL ENSURES STATE EMPLOYEES CAN CONTINUE TO SERVE THE NEEDS OF CALIFORNIA AND THE COUNTRY AND TIME OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY FOR UP TO THREE HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE DAYS INSTEAD OF THE CURRENT HUNDRED EIGHTY DAY LIMIT AND PROVIDE CLARITY DELIMITING DELAY THE PAYMENT. MEMBERS OF THE MILITARY RESERVE AND NATIONAL GUARD OFTEN MAKE SIGNIFICANTLY LESS MONEY WHILE ON MILITARY ORDERS THAN THEY DO IN THEIR CIVILIAN EMPLOYMENT. THE VARIOUS CATEGORIES OF ELIGIBILITY FOR DIFFERENTIAL PAY PROVIDE FINANCIAL SECURITY TO STATE EMPLOYEES TO ENSURE THAT UNDER CERTAIN. UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES THEY ARE PAID LESS WHILE SERVING OUR COUNTRY. THE CONFLICTING INTERPRETATIONS OF REFERENCE THE TITLE CAME TO THE US CODE AT THE THIRTY FOR ACTIVATION SEVERAL MEMBERS OF PDP AWAY. AND OTHER STATE EMPLOYEES ACROSS THE STATE WERE DELAYED PAYMENTS GUARANTEED IN STATE LAW FOR OVER TEN MONTHS. IN ADDITION TO THE SAID TECHNICALLY GET DELAYING PAYMENT CURRENT STATUTE DOES NOT PROVIDE ENOUGH ELIGIBILITY TO SUFFICIENTLY COVER THE NECESSARY TIME FRAMES. FOR WHICH SOME STATE WORKERS ARE BEING ACTIVATED. AT THE TIME THAT THAT YOU WOULD RETURN THE LEGISLATURE HAD PROBABLY NOT ANTICIPATED THE WORLDWIDE PANDEMIC. THAT WOULD BRING THE COUNTRY IN CALIFORNIA TO A STANDSTILL FOR OVER A YEAR. THAT WE'RE CURRENTLY EXPERIENCING. EXISTING HUNDRED EIGHTY DAYS OF ELIGIBILITY HAS TURNED OUT TO BE WHOLLY INSUFFICIENT. ALMOST EMPLOYEES ACTIVATED FOR COVERED RESPONSE WERE ACTIVATED FOR UNDER UNDER ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY DAYS. A HANDFUL OF THE STATE EMPLOYEES HAVE BEEN ACTIVATED FOR WELL BEYOND A HUNDRED EIGHTY DILLON AT. AND IN THE PROCESS THEY'VE- HAD TO ABSORB SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL IMPACT BECAUSE THEY MAKE CONSIDERABLY LESS WHILE SERVING IN THE MILITARY.
