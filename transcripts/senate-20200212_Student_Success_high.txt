EVERYONE- SENATORS STEVE GLAZER CHAIR OF THE SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON STUDENT SUCCESS AND I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL FOR BEING HERE IN THE ROOM OR- VIEWING I SAW. ON YOUR TELEVISION SET- THIS IS I THINK OF THE SIX OR SEVEN TH HEARING OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON STUDENT SUCCESS- AND AS WE ALL KNOW TE MEMORY FUNCTION OF OUR HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEM IS TO EDUCATE OUR STUDENTS AND HELP THEM OR AGREE. AND IT'S CLEAR THAT ALL THE DATA THAT WE'VE LOOKED AT THAT THE LONGER STUDENTS STAYS IN SCHOO. YA FOUR YEAR THE LESS LIKELY THEY ARE TO LEAVE WITH A DEGREE AND THIS OUTCOME CAN LEAVE THEM- IN DEBT. UNABLE TO EARN A SALARY THAT ALLOWS THEM TO CLIMB THE ECONOMIC LADDER THAT TIES SO VITAL TO THEM AND THEIR FAMILY AND TO OUR STATE. THAT IS WHY STUDENT SUCCESS IS SO IMPORTANT AND THAT IS WHY WE NEED TO FOCUS OUR RESOURCES ON HELPING STUDENTS GRADUATE- IN A TIMELY FASHION- AND WE'RE GONNA IT HERE WE'RE GOING TO FOCUS ON THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY TODAY. AND THEY INEVITABLE CAN TO THIS CAUSE WITH THEIR GRADUATION INITIATIVE- INTRODUCED BY- CHANCELLOR WHITE AND WITH THE CALIFORNIA PROMISE PROGRAM THAT. I AUTHORED TOGETHER WITH THE CENTER DALY ALLEN- THE- SYSTEM HAS. AT HAS DONE SOME REALLY AMAZING THINGS AND I KNOW THE DOCTOR MINERS GONNA TALK ABOUT THEM BUT I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT A FEW OF THE- OF THE ELEMENTS OF THAT. THAT FOR YEARS AGO- THEIR GRADUATION RATE- WAS 19% AND TODAY IT IS TWENTY EIGHT PERCENT. 28% AND THAT- AND THEY SET A GOAL TO REACH 40% BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE AND I KNOW THAT- THAT THAT WORK THAT HAS BEEN DONE WAS NOT EASY. AND IT SHOWS A GREAT COMMITMENT BY THE CHANCELLOR IN THE SYSTEM LEADERSHIP FIVE OUR UNIVERSITY PRESIDENTS- BY THE FACULTY BY THE STAFF STUDENTS AND MANY MORE IN THE LEGISLATURE O JOIN TOGETHER TO TRY TO. HELP THE SYSTEM I DO THE WORK BETTER BETTER AT AND I WANT TO JUST NOTE THAT DURING THAT FIVE YEAR PERIOD- WHERE THE IMPROVEMENT HAS HAPPENED- THAT THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR I PROVIDED AT TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. AND ADDITIONAL FUNDS TO HELP THE SYSTEM MEET THESE NEW HIRE GRADUATION ALL TARGETS GOOD NIGHT AND MAYES LIKE A LOT OF MONEY. I THAT SYSTEM AT THAT TENDS OVER SO WILLIAM. RESOURCES EVERY YEAR. SO IF YOU LOOK AT THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT THE STATE PROVIDE OF THIS. AND OF THAT TWO HUNDRED MILLION THAT WE HAVE PROVIDED THE LAST FEW YEARS THAT'S ABOUT A 1% LITTLE BIT LESS THAN A 1% IMPROVEMENT IN RESOURCES TO GET A 40% 47% INCREASE IN PRODUCTION OKAY THINK ABOUT THAT ANYWHERE IN STATE GOVERNMENT YOU GAVE LESS THAN ONE PERCENT- ENHANCE RESOURCES AND GOT UP 47% RATE OF RETURN FOR THE WORK THAT THEY HAVE DONE THAT'S EXTRAORDINARY. AND THAT IS BECAUSE THEY TARGETED THOSE RESOURCES FOR ADVISING FOR COUNSELING FOR ADDITIONAL FACULTY- AND- IT'S MAKING A HUGE DIFFERENCE AND I WANT TO CONGRATULATE THE SYSTEM AND ALL THOSE INVOLVED IN OVER HERE FROM TO SUCCESS STORIES AT SAN JOSE AND SACRAMENTO IN JUST A FEW MINUTES. I THAT IS THAT THE PURPOSE OF OUR HEARING TODAY IT'S TO REVIEW THE PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE I UNDERSTAND THE REASONS FOR IT- AND ALSO SEE PLACES IN WHICH THINGS CAN BE. DONE BETTER I WANT TO REFERENCE THAT CHART THAT. PEOPLE HAVE BEEN GIVEN HAS A HIGHLIGHT ON TOP. AND THIS SHOWS THAT A LIST OF THE CAMPUSES OF THE UNIVERSITY. AND THEIR PROGRESS IN MEETING THEIR GRADUATION GOALS. AND ON THIS CHART YOU'LL SEE- THAT STAND OUT SACRAMENTO STATE IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS HAS HAD A HUNDRED AND 22% IMPROVEMENT. SAN JOSE STATE A HUNDRED AND TWENTY SEVEN. PERCENT IMPROVEMENT- LONG BEACH STATE HUNDRED AND 27% IMPROVEMENT IN FIVE YEARS AND THEIR FOUR YEAR GRADUATION RATES THOSE ARE INCREDIBLE GREAT PROGRESS POINTS AND WILL LEARN ACT TODAY SOME OF THE LESSONS FROM THOSE CAMPUSES IN TERMS OF WHAT THEY'RE DOING SO RIGHT BUT ON THIS CHART YOU'LL ALSO SEE SOME UNIVERSITIES THAT HAVE. FALLEN SHORT. CAL STATE EAST BAY WHICH IS IN MY NECK OF THE WOODS IN FIVE YEARS THEIR FOUR YEAR GRADUATION RATE IS ACTUALLY GONE DOWN FOURTEEN PERCENT. BUT CHANNEL ISLANDS GONE DOWN 4% TO PROGRESS IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION. SO WE HAVE THIS COMBINATION OF INCREDIBLE PROGRESS SYSTEM WIDE. FROM RATES AND THAT INDIVIDUAL CAMPUSES THAT EXCEED A 100% IMPROVEMENT. AND THEN WE HAVE SOME CAMPUS IS FALLING SHORT SO I HOPE THAT. WE CAN DO TWO THINGS TODAY WE CAN SEPARATE OUR SUCCESS UNDERSTAND LESSONS FROM THOSE EXPERIENCES ON THOSE CAMPUSES. AND ALSO RECOMMIT AND LEARN WHAT WE CAN DO TO HELP THE OTHERS DO EVEN BETTER. I KNOW THE SYSTEM SET A HIGH GOAL FOR THEM 40% FOUR YEAR GRADUATION RATE BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE I KNOW WE CAN DO BETTER THAN THAT. I KNOW THAT WE'RE COMMITTED TO HELPING IT TO BETTER THAN THAT. ALL RIGHT. SO WITH THAT I WANT TO THANK CENTER SENATE LABOR DO FOR BEING HERE I THINK THEY'LL BE SOME OTHER SUCH WILL JOIN IN THE COURSE OF THIS HEARING WHEN I. BEGIN THE PANEL THAT ONE OFFER ANY MY COLLAR. OR TO THE SAME ONE. WE START OKAY. OKAY THREE. WELL I ONE OF THE LEADERS OF THAT THE SYSTEM THE I THIS IS. OF TO SUCCESS HAS BEEN DONE JAMES MINOR HE'S COMMITTED THE LAST FEW YEARS. FORCEFULLY AND FOCUS TO HELPING CAMPUSES DO BETTER AND WE APPRECIATE YOU OUT THERE PART OF OUR HEARINGS THAT WE'VE HAD IN THE PAST WE WERE YOU ATTENDED THE- HEARING WE HAD AT POMONA. I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP AND WE LOOK FORTY YOUR THOUGHTS AND COMMENTS ON ON THE ISSUE TODAY. WELCOME THANK YOU SENATOR GOOD AFTERNOON- SHE HEARD I'M JAMES MINOR SERVICE THE- THE SYSTEM VICE CHANCELLOR AND SENIOR STRATEGIST AT THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY IN THE OFFICE OF THE CHANCELLOR. I WANT TO JUST TAKE A FEW MINUTES THIS AFTERNOON TO GIVE YOU AN OVERVIEW IN JUST A FEW DETAILS ABOUT THE GRADUATION INITIATIVE WORK. AS THE SENATOR MENTIONED WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT SOME OF OUR SUCCESSES BUT ALSO SOME OF OUR CONTINUING CHALLENGES. AND THEN I'LL I'LL TURN IT OVER TO MY COLLEAGUES TO SHARE SOME ABOUT THE CAMPUS EXPERIENCE AS WE NEAR- THE HALF WAY MARK. CAMPUSES ARE CONTINUING TO IMPLEMENT AND REFINE THEIR STUDENT SUCCESS PLANS WHILE WELCOMING NEWLY HIGHER FACULTY AND ADVISORS AND ROLLING STUDENTS AN ADDITIONAL COURSE SECTION AND IMPLEMENTING EVIDENCE BASED STUDENT SUPPORT PROGRAMS AT THE SYSTEM LEVEL ARE SIX OPERATIONAL PRIORITIES- ART WHICH ARE LISTED IN THE HANDOUT THAT WE PROVIDE IT CONTINUE TO DRIVE OUR WORK TO ACHIEVE THE GOALS OF THE INITIATIVE TODAY I LIKE TO TOUCH ON JUST THREE BROAD AREAS FIRST AT THE PROGRESS. IN THE SYSTEM WHILE UPDATE RESPECT TO THE GRADUATION RATES SECOND OF THE OVERALL. THE OVERVIEW OF SOME PRACTICES THAT ARE CONTRIBUTED THE GAINSTHAT WE'RE SEEING IN THE GRADUATION RATES AND THIRD AREAS OF FOCUS THAT WE NEED TO ADDRESS IN ORDER TO CONTINUE MOMENTUM. FOR SO FIRST THE PROGRESS OF DAY THREE YEARS INTO THE GRADUATION INITIATIVE I AM PLEASED TO REPORT THAT OUR- STUDENTS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE SIGNIFICANTRETURNS ON INVESTMENT AS WE JUST HEARD. FOR THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN TWENTY NINETEEN ACADEMIC YEAR OVER ONE HUNDRED AND SEVEN THOUSAND BACHELOR'S DEGREES WERE EARNED BY STUDENTS IN THE C. ISSUE A HUNDRED AND TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND ALL TOGETHER. THIS RECORD NUMBER OF DEGREES REPRESENTS TWENTY THOUSAND MORE GRADUATES COMPARED TO TWENTY FIFTEEN. WHICH WAS THE YEAR BEFORE THE INITIATIVE WAS LAUNCHED TO PUT THIS INTO PERSPECTIVE SENATOR TWENTY THOUSAND ADDITIONAL DEGREE HOLDERS. EXCEEDS THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS CURRENTLY ATTENDING CAL STATE EAST BAY SO IF YOU COULD IMAGINE THE ENTIRE STUDENT BODY CROSSING THE COMMENCEMENT STAGE. ALONG WITH SIX THOUSAND OF THEIR FRIENDS IS THE IS THE IMAGE OF WE'RE TRYING TO PROVIDE FOR YOU THIS THIS AFTERNOON. THE SYSTEM WHY GAINES WORD SHE WHILE THEY'RE ROLLING MORE STUDENTS AND A GREATER PERCENTAGE OF STUDENTS FROM UNDERSERVED. ALL WHILE HOLDING THE LINE UP TO WHICH WHICH IS PER MARK. TO REPORT THAT THE GRADUATE TO RAY ARE AT ALL TIME. IN VERGE EVERY COUNTY. THE FOR YOUR GRAD RATE AS YOU HEARD IS THAT TO EIGHT PER OF FROM NINE WE CAN. WITH CONTINUED INVESTMENT WERE ABLE TO MAINTAIN STUDY PROGRESS TOWARDS OUR GOAL OF GRADUATING IN FOUR YEARS. ALSO ON A REFERENCE HERE THE SIX YEAR GRADUATION RATE IS THAT SIXTY TWO PERCENT. AND I HOPE THIS BECOMES ONE OF OUR TALKING POINTS THIS EXCEEDS THE NATIONAL AVERAGE FOR PUBLIC FOUR YEAR UNIVERSITIES WHICH IS ALSO REMARKABLE SEVERAL CAMPUSES ARE ALREADY MEETING OR SO PASSED. THE SYSTEM WHY SIX YEAR OLD. 70% FOR TRANSFERS. TO YOUR GRADUATION RATE IS AT 41% THE HIGHEST EVER FOR THE C. ISSUE. AND THE FOR YOUR TRANSFER GRADUATION RATE IS THAT 78% ALSO THE HIGHEST EVER FOR THE C. ISSUE. IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THE TRANSFER STUDENTS WHO MAY GRADUATE IN TWO POINT FIVE OR EVEN THREE YEARS AFTER ARRIVING IN ARE INCLUDED IN THE FOUR YEAR RATE. BEFORE THE GRADUATION INITIATIVE TRANSFER STUDENT COMPLETION RATES WERE ALREADY AMONG THE HIGHEST IN THE NATION COMPARED TO PEER INSTITUTIONS. BUT WHAT CONTINUED INVESTMENT FROM THE STATE AND STRATEGIC FOCUS CAMPUSES HAVE ENHANCED THEIR SUPPORT. FOR TRANSFER STUDENTS FURTHER AUGMENTING THEIR SUCCESS WHICH IS IMPORTANT SINCE 51% OF C. ISSUE STUDENTS. ARE STARTED AT A COMMUNITY COLLEGE. NOW WHILE THE UPTICK IN. PERCENTAGE POINT GAMES MAY SEEM SMALL. OFTEN HAVE TO REMIND LISTENERS THAT EACH PERCENTAGE POINT GAIN AND GRADUATION RATE REPRESENTS MORE THAN A THOUSAND STUDENTS. SO A JUST A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW WE GOT HERE THESE HISTORIC GAINES DID NOT HAPPEN BY ACCIDENT. THEY ARE THE RESULT OF COLLABORATIVE IN STRATEGIC THINKING IMPLEMENTATION OF SYSTEM WHY POLICY CHANGES AND FACULTY STAFF AND ADMINISTRATORS BREAKING DOWN INSTITUTIONAL SILOS AND IMPLEMENTING CULTURAL AND PROGRAMMATIC CHANGES AIMED DIRECTLY AT IMPROVING THE EXPERIENCE OF OUR STUDENTS. TODAY YOU'LL HEAR FROM REPRESENTATIVES FROM SACRAMENTO STATE AND SAN JOSE STATE ABOUT THEIR SUCCESS AND THE CHALLENGES THEY FACE BUT ALL TWENTY THREE CAMPUSES COULD TELL YOU A STORY ABOUT HOW THEY'RE TAILORED APPROACH TO INCREASING STUDENT SUCCESS IS CONTRIBUTING TO GRADUATION RATES. AND BETTER WITHIN THE GRADUATION INITIATIVE IS A FUNDAMENTAL RECOGNITION THAT LOCALIZATION AND THE IN NEED AND THE NEED TO ACCOUNT FOR VARIATIONS IN STUDENT DEMOGRAPHICS AND CAMPUS NEEDS AND TO DEVELOP CUSTOMIZED APPROACH TO IMPLEMENTATION IS IMPORTANT. WITH SAID THERE ARE AFFECT THE PRICE IS THAT NEARLY EVERY CAMPUSES WOMEN AT SUCH BAND IN THE USE OF. TRYING AND DIGITAL ADVISING TOOLS. SYSTEM BY WE HAVE FIFTEEN FOR EXAMPLE PARTICIPATING IN A STUDENT SUCCESS COLLABORATIVE FOCUSED ON ADVISING ANALYTICS THAT IMPROVES THE USE AND SHARING OF REAL TIME DATA TO MORE FOR EFFECTIVELY SUPPORT STUDENT SUCCESS IN SENDS WARNING SIGNS TO STAFF. WHEN A STUDENT IS AT RISK OF GETTING OFF TRACK. THIS TECHNOLOGY IN THE HANDS OF ADVISORS AND STUDENTS CAN HELP STUDENTS MAKE MORE INFORMED DECISIONS ABOUT THEIR EDUCATION. THE ADOPTION OF THESE DIGITAL TO ARE CRITICAL TO GRADUATION INITIATIVE BECAUSE IT STREAMLINES ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESS SEES ALLOWING ADVISORS TO ENGAGE IN PROACTIVE STRATEGIC CARE WHILE MONITORING PROGRESS TOWARDS KEY ACADEMIC MILESTONES. TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT LATER IF WE HAVE THAT ARE IMPROVING OUR CAMPUS SUCCESS SUCH AS IT CSU NORTHRIDGE FOR EXAMPLE THE CAMPUS IS PLACE A GRADUATION RETENTION SPECIALIST IN THE FINANCIAL AID OFFICE TO HELP STUDENTS BETTER UNDERSTAND THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THEIR FINANCIAL AID PACKAGE. AND THEIR COURSE SCHEDULE DECISIONS. I ALSO LIKE TO TAKE JUST A MOMENT TO ADDRESS THE CALIFORNIA PROMISE PROGRAM. AS YOU KNOW CSU CAMPUSES EXCEED THE NUMBER OF PROMISE PROGRAMS MANDATED AN S. FOUR TWELVE WITH THIRTEEN CAMPUSES CURRENTLY OFFERING A FOR YOUR PLEDGE PROGRAM. AND ALL BUT TWO ARE FREE TO YOUR PLEDGE PROGRAM. AND OPEN A MORE EFFECTIVE ADVERTISE THE FOR A PROGRAM STUDENTS ARE NOW DIRECTED TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THE CALIFORNIA PROMISE PROGRAM. THROUGH A TAB ON THE CAL STATE APPLY WEBSITE AND AS YOU KNOW THIS IS THE WEBSITE WERE ALL SEE ISSUE APPLICANTS. GO TO INTERACT AND FILE THEIR APPLICATIONS CHANCE OR WHITE IS ALSO DIRECTED SEE ISSUE PRESIDENT'S TO CONTINUE INCREASING THEIR EFFORTS TO ADVERTISE THE PROGRAM TO NEW STUDENTS PRIOR TO ENROLLMENT. IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE THE C. ISSUE WILL PROVIDE A REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE THAT OUTLINES THE RESULTS OF CAMPUS PARTICIPATION AND THE PROMISE PROGRAM AND THE RELATED STUDENT OUTCOMES. WE SEE THIS IS ONE OF SEVERAL EFFECTIVE EFFORTS BEING EMPLOYED BY CAMPUSES TO MEET OUR GRADUATION RATE GOALS. UNDER THE GRADUATION INITIATIVE TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. WHAT'S NEXT WELL WE'RE PROUD OF THE GRADUATION RATE IMPROVEMENTS FOR ALL STUDENTS FROM ALL BACKGROUNDS WE HAVE NOT YET BEEN ABLE TO CLOSE THE EQUITY GAP AND I WANT TO PAUSE HERE BECAUSE- AN ACKNOWLEDGE THE LEADERSHIP OF CHANCE WERE RIGHT OUT. FAIR TO SAY THAT THE C. ISSUE IS PROBABLY ONE OF A VERY SMALL NUMBER OF SYSTEMS THAT HAVE PUBLICLY DECLARED THE GOAL OF COMPLETELY CLOSE IN THE EQUITY GAP AND I THINK THAT'S COMMENDABLE. THE FIRST AREA THAT MUST FOCUS ON HOWEVER IS EXPANDING OUR CONCERTED EFFORT TO CLOSE EQUITY GAPS WE CONTINUE TO IDENTIFY ACTIONS THAT ARE GOOD FOR ALL STUDENTS. YET THEY ALSO HAVE A DISPROPORTIONATELY POSITIVE IMPACT. ON OUR MOST UNDERSERVED POPULATIONS. THESE INCLUDE THE ADAPTING IN AN EXPANDING SOME OF OUR BEST PRACTICES UTILIZED BY R. E. O. P. PROGRAMS SUCH AS ACTIVE ADVISING SUMMER BRIDGE STRUCTURE LEARNING SUPPORT AND COAL HOARDING STUDENTS TO INCREASE THEIR CHANCES OF BEING A RETAIN. IT ALSO INCLUDES A GREATER PERCENTAGE OF STUDENTS EARNING THIRTY CREDITS IN THE FIRST YEAR AS WELL AS COMPLETING THE MAP THEM AND WRITTEN COMMUNICATIONS REQUIREMENTS IN THEIR FIRST YEAR IS A CRITICAL MILESTONE. CLOSING THE EQUITY GAP ALSO MEANS MAKING SYSTEMIC CHANGES TO REDUCE BARRIERS FOR HISTORICALLY UNDERSERVED STUDENT- AND NO STUDENTS FROM THOSE FROM UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES. AS A RESULT OF THE EFFORTS THAT BEGAN OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS. AS THEY BECOME MORE INGRAINED ON OUR CAMPUSES WE FIRMLY ANTICIPATE THAT WE WILL SEE SIGNIFICANT ERROR IN. EQUITY GAPS THIS IS PARTICULARLY TRUE WHEN THE FIRST CORPS STUDENTS WHO ENTERED UNDER THE ISSUES NEW ACADEMIC PREPARATION POLICIES BEGAN TO GRADUATE AND TWENTY TWENTY TWO. OUR SECOND AREA OF FOCUS SYSTEMICALLY IS IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF ACADEMIC ADVISING. FROM THE TIME A STUDENT IS ADMITTED UNTIL THE TIME A STUDENT CROSSES THE COMMENCEMENT STAGE. CAMPUSES ARE ALREADY IDENTIFIED WHAT WORKS FOR THEIR STUDENTS TO INSURE A CLEAR PATH TO DEGREE. TO A DEGREE BEGINNING ON DAY ONE. THIS INCLUDES GETTING NON STATIC DEGREE PLANS IN THE HANS OF STUDENTS BEFORE THEY REGISTER FOR THEIR FIRST TERM. IMPROVING DATA USAGE TO OPTIMIZE COURSE SCHEDULING AND TO INCREASE TIMELY COMMUNICATION WITH STUDENTS ABOUT THEIR PROGRESS AND NAVIGATING THE REMAINING REQUIREMENTS. THE THIRD AND FINAL AREA THAT I WANT TO MENTION ALL IS PROMOTING STUDENT SUCCESS AND ADDRESS SOME BASIC NEEDS.THEIR NUMBER EFFORTS- TO RESPOND TO MENTAL HEALTH CONCERNS AND CREATIVE AND INNOVATIVE WAYS SUCH AS DEVELOPING PARTNERSHIPS WITH COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS. LAST APRIL THAT SEE ISSUE HELD A CONFEENCE WERE CAMPUS MENTAL HEALTH TEAMS AND COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS. CAME TOGETHER TO FIND WAYS TO BETTER MEET THE MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS OF OUR STUDENTS. IN ADDITION TO ESTABLISHING COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIPS CAMPUSES ARE ALSO INVESTING AND HIRING MORE MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS. BETWEEN TWENTY EIGHTEEN ALL TO NINETEEN THE HEART AND SO NET NEW TIME MENTAL HEALTH. ADDED ACROSS THE SYSTEM AND YET WE KNOW WE HAVE MUCH MORE TO. ONLY INSULAR ARE THE CHANCE WAS OFF IS ISSUE GRAN TO QUE THIS WITH THE A- MAIL PROVIDE BY THE STATE FOR BASIC. EMERGENCY HOUSING AND MENTAL HEALTH AND LAST YEAR'S BUDGET. IN THEIR PROPOSALS CAMPUSES HIGHLIGHTED A EXCITING PLANS TO DEVELOP AND EXPAND EXTERNAL BASIC NEEDS PARTNERSHIPS HELPING TO MAKE SURE THE STUDENTS HAVE THE RESOURCES AND SUPPORT NEEDED TO BE SUCCESSFUL. THESE THREE AREAS- BUT I JUST HIGHLIGHTED ARE IMPORTANT. THEY'RE NOT EXHAUSTIVE BUT THEY'RE IMPORTANT TO CONTINUE OUR GRADUATION RATE PROGRESS I THINK WE HAVE SAID FROM THE BEGINNING THIS WILL LIKELY NOT BE A LINEAR PROCESS BUT WE HAVE TO SUSTAIN MOMENTUM IF WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE GAINES. AND GRADUATE FROM RATES AND CLOSE IN THE EQUITY GAPS. IN MANY RESPECTS. INCREASING GRADUATION RATE DOES MEAN MORE STUDENTS TAKEN THIRTY UNITS PER YEAR. AND TO ACCOMPLISH THIS WE MUST HAVE MORE CLASSES AND MORE FACULTY TO ENSURE THAT STUDENTS CAN A ROLL AND THE CLASSES THEY NEED WHEN THEY NEED THEM. CURRENTLY THE AVERAGE UNIT LOW FOR UNDERGRADUATES IS THIRTEEN POINT FOUR UNITS. TO INCREASE THIS AMOUNT TO FOURTEEN JUST TO GO FROM THIRTEEN POINT FOUR TO FOURTEEN WHAT REQUIRE. A RECURRING INVESTMENT OF A HUNDRED AND FORTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS TO HIRE ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTION OR INSTRUCTORS AND TO OFFER THE COURSES NECESSARY FOR OUR STUDENTS. SENATOR GO FROM FOURTEEN UNITS TO FIFTEEN UNITS BY OUR CALCULATIONS SYSTEM WHY. IS ROUGHLY FOUR HUNDRED AND TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS A RECURRING FUNDING. AS WE ETER THE FOURTH YEAR OF THE GRADUATION INITIATIVE- THE DATA SHOW THAT WE CONTINUE TO MAKE A PROGRESS. RECORD HIGH GRADUATION RATES AND THE MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED AND SEVEN THOUSAND GRADUATES ARE TESTAMENT TO WHAT CAN BE ACHIEVED THROUGH INVESTING IN OUR STUDENTS OUR CAMPUSES AND THE SEA ISSUE. THIS YEAR THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES HAS REQUESTED A HUNDRED AND FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR GRADUATION INITIATIVE TWENTY TWENTY FIVE THIS AMOUNT INCLUDES. THE FOURTH OF SIX INSTALLMENTS OF THE SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT THAT WAS REQUESTED AND CONVERTING THE ONE TIME FUNDING FOR GRADUATION INITIATIVE TO OWN ONGOING. THIS INVESTMENT HAS NEVER BEEN MORE CRITICAL. A CLASS THAT WILL DETERMINE OUR SIX YEAR GRADUATION RATE. AND OUR EQUITY GAP GOALS ARE ON OUR CAMPUSES TODAY. FINALLY THE STUDENTS LIKE ALL OF OUR STUDENTS DESERVE EVERY OPPORTUNITY TO REACH THEIR DEGREE GOALS AND TO PURSUE A BRIGHT FUTURE FOR THEMSELVES THEIR FAMILY AND FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THANK YOU SENATOR. THANK YOU DOCTOR MINOR AND- **** THE PROGRESS REPORT AND ALL THE HARD WORK THAT YOU IN A CHANCE OR IN YOUR WHOLE TAM HAS BEEN INVOLVED WITH- CENTER ROTH QUESTION. THANK YOU MISTER I APOLOGIZE- I HAVE WILL HAVE TO LEAVE IN A MINUTE TO I HAVE TO COMMITTEES MEETING AT THE SAME TIME BUT- LET ME ASK AND HAVE LOTS OF QUESTIONS INCLUDING ON MENTAL HEALTH INSURANCE BUT LET ME AS THE ONE THE- THREE MOST PERTINENT TO THIS CONVERSATION STUDENT SUCCESS ENCOURAGED. TO NEST WITH ACADEMIC COUNSELING AND ADVISING ANSWER YOU MENTIONED IT IN YOUR INITIAL PRESENTATION. SO MY QUESTION IS THIS. IS THE SYSTEM ADEQUATELY FUNDED. FOR ACADEMIC COUNSELING THROUGHOUT THE SYSTEM. I GUESS I HAVE ANOTHER DOES THIS. AS A SYSTEM PUT IN A REQUEST THAT CONTAINS ADEQUATELY FUNDED ADEQUATE FUNDING FOR ACADEMIC COUNSELING IF IT'S EMBEDDED IN YOUR STUDENT SUCCESS BCP. AND IF NOT WHAT IS THE NUMBER AND IF YOU CAN'T PROVIDED TODAY WE WILL HAVE ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY IN A FEW WEEKS BUT I WOULD BE INTERESTED IN THAT BECAUSE IT SEEMS TO ME THAT FOR FOCUSED ON STUDENT SUCCESS AND GRADUATING KEY TO THAT IS ACADEMIC EFFECTIVE ACADEMIC COUNSELING AND PART OF IT MAY BE THE ELECTRONIC OPERATE. IN THAT YOU REFERENCED IN YOUR PRESENTATION BUT THERE'S PROBABLY NO SUBSTITUTE. TO FACE TO FACE CONVERSATION WITH THE CANCER WHO KNOWS WHAT HE OR SHE IS DOING. YES THANK YOU SENATOR IT'S A GREAT QUESTION SO THE SHORT ANSWER HOWEVER IS NOW A WE ARE NOT ADEQUATELY FUNDED TO PROVIDE THE NUMBER OF ACADEMIC ADVISERS FOR OUR STUDENTS THERE IS AN INDUSTRY STANDARD WERE FAR FROM IT. I CAN TELL YOU THAT IS SOLD THE APPROACH HAS BEEN TO GO AS FAR AS WE CAN WITH HIRING INDIVIDUALS WE KNOW THAT IS ONE OF THE MOST EXPENSIVE THINGS WE DO IS A UNIVERSITY SYSTEM. BUT TO TRY TO AUGMENT THAT WITH- BETTER AND MORE EFFICIENT USE OF DIGITAL ADVISING TOOLS ARE WE KNOW THAT MOST OF OUR STUDENTS ARRIVE WITH THE SMART ONE AND SELL SOME OF THIS IS CAN WE- I'M BETTER MORE. BILL TO INFORMATION TO THE ABOUT THE CHOICES OF SCHEDULE. AND TO BAIL THE OTHER SIDE OF THE COIN SO ONCE WE GIVE A STUDENT GREAT ADVICE ABOUT WHAT TO DO. SHE OR HE HAS TO BE ABLE TO ACTUALLY DO IT ON THE CAMPUS AND A GREAT EXAMPLE OF THIS MARRIAGE BETWEEN. BETTER AND MORE EFFECTIVE COUNSELING. AND ADDITIONAL COURSE SECTIONS AN ADDITIONAL FACULTY A FIRE AS A STUDENT I COULD POPULATE MY SCHEDULE. BUT IF THE COURSES ARE NOT AVAILABLE TO ME WHEN I NEED THEM- DOESN'T MATTER HOW GOOD THE OR THE QUALITY OF THE ADVICE IS THAT THE INSTITUTION HAS TO BE ABLE TO ACCOMMODATE STUDENTS. ACCORDING TO THEIR NEEDS SO. WE ALL WORKED OUT THE NUMBER- MAY OF OUR QUE AS HAVE USED A PORTION. GRADUATION INITIATIVE FAR HIGHER ADDITIONAL ACADEMIC COUNSELORS- AND AMPUS PRESIDENTS HAVE MADE THOSE DECIIONS AND THAT AMOUNT VARIES ACROSS THE CAMPUS. BUT I THINK IT IS A VERY WELL KNOWN FACT. THAT NUMBER AND RATIO. OF COUNSEL TO STUDENTS THIS SIMPLY NOT ADEQUATE. WELL I WANT TO RESPECT THE BCP PROCESS AND THE RELATIONSHIP THAT WE HAVE ON THIS FLOOR IN THE FLOORS ABOVE US WITH THE FIRST FLOOR. BUT I WILL BE ASKING THE QUESTION IN A COUPLE WEEKS. TO WHAT EXACTLY WE WOULD DO IS A LEGISLATURE. VIS A VIS THE C. ISSUE ISTOM. TO ADEQUATELY FUND AT ACADEMIC COUNSELING ACROSS THE BOARD SO THAT STUDENTS WHO NEED COUNSELING HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO GET IT. AND GET IT WITHIN A REASONABLE PERIOD OF TIME BECAUSE IT OCCURS TO ME. ALTHOUGH I'M DECADES AND DECADES REMOVED FROM THE ACADEMIC SETTING. THAT IF A STUDENT MAKES A MISTAKE. BECAUSE A STUDENT CAN ACCESS A COUNSELOR OR OF THE CANCER MAKES A MISTAKE BECAUSE THE CANCER DOESN'T KNOW NECESSARILY BUT HERE SHE HAPPENS TO BE DOING IN THAT AND A PARTICULAR INSTANCE. IT CAN COST STOOPED AND KISSED HIM ONE TWO THREE OR FOUR SEMESTERS. OF A STUDENT'S PRESENCE ON CAMPUS WHEN THE STUDENT MIGHT NEST MIGHT OTHERWISE BE ABLE TO GRADUATE EIGHT. FREE UP SEAT FOR ELSE SO I. ASKING THE QUESTION. NOT TO GET WINTER. WITH FIRST FOR NBC PROCESS BUT IT WILL BE A LEGISLATIVE QUESTION AND THE QUESTION OF BRITAIN'S WOULD LOVE TO KNOW THE NUMBER SO. THANK YOU AND THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR FOR YOUR PATIENCE. GREAT THANK YOU SENATOR ROBB CENTER LEYVA. THANK YOU CENTER GLAZER OF FIFTY DOT MINOR FOR THAT VERY COMPREHENSIVE REPORT. MY QUESTION IS ALSO FINANCIAL IN NATURE. IF WE ONLY INCREASED FUNDING BY WHAT PERCENT I THINK THAT'S WHAT THE CHAIRS. BUT YOU WERE ABLE TO GREG. RATES FROM I MEAN SERIOUSLY HOW DID YOU DO THAT WITH SUCH A SMALL AMOUNT OF MONEY. YEAH SO IT'S SO IT'S A GREAT QUESTION I WILL TELL YOU THAT EVERY INTERVENTION THAT WE HAVE. EMPLOYED OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS NOT ALL OF THEM WERE COST INTENSIVE. SOL IT JUST JUST FOR A POINT OF REFERENCE SENATOR WHEN WE BEGAN THE GRADUATION INITIATIVE AND WE WERE ATTEMPTING TO IDENTIFY APPROPRIATE TARGETS FOR THE SYSTEM. AND FOR EACH OF OUR INSTITUTIONS- WE BEGAN WHAT PEER INSTITUTIONS. WE CAN COMPARE YOU KNOW HARVARD AND STANFORD A YEAR WE WENT TO FIND A REGIONAL PUBLIC FOUR YEAR INSTITUTIONS THAT ROOM ROLLING SIMILAR STUDENTS TO TAR SEE ISSUE POPULATION. WE FOUND TWO THINGS ONE THAT- PER PUPIL SPENDING WAS WAS FAR DIFFERENT. BUT WE ALSO LEARNED THAT THERE WERE SOME STRUCTURAL DIFFERENCES IN TERMS OF HOW ALL CAMPUSES WERE GOING ABOUT- ADVISING STUDENTS REGISTERING THEM FROM CLASSES SO I. I THINK WHAT'S IMPORTANT HERE WE HAVE- WE HAVE IT WE HAVE OUT SIZE OR OUTPERFORM BASED ON THE INVESTMENT. BUT I THINK SOMEONE ARTICULATED THIS WAY THAT WE'VE PICKED ALL OF THE LOW HANGING FRUIT. AND THEN SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WILL REQUIRE MORE INTENSIVE INVESTMENT PEOPLE. ADDITIONAL COUNSELORS MENTAL HEALTH COUNSELORS ADDITIONAL FACULTY- ADDITIONS AND PHYSICAL SPACE TO OFFER ADDITIONAL COURSES THOSE ITEMS WILL BE. NOT ONLY ONGOING COST BUT ALSO MUCH MORE COST INTENSIVE. VERY GOOD THANK YOU AND WOULD YOU SAY THAT THE MOST IMPORTANT I KNOW ALL OF IT'S IMPORTANT BUT WOULD YOU SAY THAT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING WOULD BE TO HIRE ADDITIONAL FACULTY SO THAT YOU CAN OPEN MORE CLASS SECTIONS. THAT BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT I HEAR FROM STUDENTS ALL THE TIME IS THAT I CAN'T GET THE CLASS I NEED UNTIL NEXT SEMESTER OR THE FOLLOWING SEMESTER INTO RICHARD'S POINT THAT AND THEN IT KEEPS THEM IN SCHOOL LONGER AND IT DOESN'T FOR A SEAT FOR SOMEONE ELSE. SO I THINK THE SHORT ANSWER IS YES ONE OF QUALIFY MY YES IF I MAY. AND YOU KNOW MY PROFESSIONAL OPINION IS THAT YES THAT IS TRUE BUT BUT THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT EQUATION IS REALIZING A GREATER SENSE OF EFFICIENCY. AND HOW WE USE AND ACCESS THE AVAILABLE COURSES IN THE COURSE SCHEDULE. SO I THINK IT'S A COMBINATION OF BOTH YES WE NEED MORE VOLUME WE NEED MORE CAPACITY BUT I WILL SAY WE ALSO HAVE TO INCREASE THE EFFICIENCY IN THAT INTERACTION BETWEEN OUR COURSE SCHEDULE AND THE CHOICES THAT STUDENTS MAKE THAT LEAD TO ACADEMIC PROGRESS. VERY GOOD THAT'S VERY HELPFUL THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU SENATOR-LEYVA- I WANNA HAD MENTIONED- ANOTHER CHART THIS IN YOUR INFORMATIONAL MATERIAL IT TALKS ABOUT HOW MANY UNITS STUDENTS ARE TAKING- AT THE CSU. AND COUPLE FACTOIDS THAT COME OUT OF THAT. PARTLY ANSWERS US IN EARLY THIS QUESTION BUT- IS THAT 87% THIS TO THAT THE CSU TO TAKE A FULL LOAD. OF UNITS FOR MORE. I'D OBVIOUSLY EVERY STUDENT IS IN A UNIQUE CIRCUMSTANCE THEY COULD WORK OBLIGATIONS FAMILY OBLIGATIONS BUT- THE STUDENTS THAT ARE IN THE CSU FOR THE MOST PART ARE TRYING TO GET THROUGH. AS QUICKLY AS THEY CAN. AND THE BIGGEST PROGRESS POINT ON THIS BECAUSE THAT EIGHTY SEVEN PERCENT. I HAS INSISTED OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS TAKING TWELVE ANSWER BUT THE CHANGES THOSE WERE TAKING FIFTEEN. OR MORE. YOU MAY HEAR FROM CAMPUSES IN AMMAN. THAT NUMBER HAS IN FROM AROUND LOW THIRTIES TO NOW FORTY THREE PERCENT. AND WE KNOW THAT IF THEY JUST TAKE FIFTEEN UNITS. AND THEY TAKE IN THE RIGHT UNITS ON THEIR MAJOR. THAT THAT'S NOT A SET COST ELEMENT DIRECTLY BUT IT'S ABOUT TRYING TO KEEP HIM ON TRACK YEAH- ON THE COURSE THAT THEY NEED TO BE ON TO GET THROUGH IN pFOUR YEARS. OKAY WELL WE HAVE- THANK YOU DOCTOR MILLER STATE SAY TUNE I KNOW I HAVE SOME FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS BUT I WANT TO WAIT TO OUR OTHER PANELISTS OF. HAVE I SPOKEN. WELL WE DO HAVE SOME LEADERS FROM TWO OF OUR CAMPUS IS HERE TO SHARE THEIR- INSIGHTS IT'S AT SACRAMENTO AND SAN JOSE BOTH OF WHICH HAVE REALLY SHOWN TREMENDOUS. IMPROVEMENT AND WE WERE A AND EXCITED. ABOUT THEIR- THEIR WORK THERE AND THEIR INNOVATIONS THAT THEY HAVE. TO PLAY. BUT DOCTOR STEVE. THE PROVOST FROM CALIFORNIA. SACRAMENTO IS HERE. AND DOCTOR STILL YEAH I DODD KNOWS PRONOUNCED THAT RIGHT. THE VICE BOAST OF UNDERGRADUATE AT. THE SENATE STATE UNIVERSITY. ARE HERE TO SHARE THIS STORY WITH US. AND I DON'T KNOW ONCE FIRST ATTACK. THANK AND FOR YOUR MONEY. THANK YOU. GEN COMMITTEE MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR US HERE IT'S A TO PUT OF TELL YOU LITTLE BIT ABOUT EXCITED I MY NAME'S. PRESS THE PROVO FROM SAT. STATE AND I'M PLEASED TO ROOF PORT BACK TO YOU ON THE PROGRESS BEING MADE AT SACRAMENTO STATE TO IMPROVE OUR GRADUATION RATES AND REDUCE OUR TREATMENT. BEFORE I BEGIN I ALSO WANT TO THANK YOU SENATOR GLAZER FOR BRINGING MANY MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE TO SACRAMENTO STATE LAST MAY- WE ENJOY THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE WITH YOU HOW WE'RE IMPROVING STUDENT SUCCESS A MEETING OR STUDENTS BASIC NEEDS- AND- EACH. OF YOUR SUPPORT FOR THE CSU SACRAMENTO STATE AND OUR STUDENTS IS GREATLY APPRECIATED BY OUR ENTIRE. CAMPUS COMMUNITY. I DIDN'T LEARN I WAS GONNA BE HERE TILL- LAST WEEK- BUT I HAVE LITERALLY BEEN EXCITED TO TELL A STORY FOR YEARS SO I COULDN'T BE MORE. ARTICLE TO BE HERE I'M VERY PROUD OF. WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING A VERY PRIVILEGED TO BE ABLE TO SERVICE THE PROVOST. SACRAMENTO STATE I'VE BEEN DOING THAT FOR ABOUT A YEAR. BUT I BET ON CAMPUSES TWO THOUSAND ONE SO IT'S DRAMATIC CHANGES LAST. HANDFUL OF YEARS. WE'RE NOT FIVE YEARS INTO A CULTURE CHANGE AND SYSTEM'S CHANGE. THAT ARE TRYING TO ENCOURAGE US TO TAKE A FULL COURSE LOAD. WHICH WE WOULD SAY WE WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT FIFTEEN MINUTES- BECAUSE THAT WILL GET OUR STUDENTS. AND FOUR. ENSURE THE COURSES ARE AVAILABLE TO THEM AND PORT ACT. FOR PERSONAL. I DO. SIX ALWAYS BEEN OUR MISSION ALWAYS WILL BE QUESTION. THE% CHANGE POCKET. IS WHO ARE NOW. ACTIVELY AND- WITH C. OUT NEW WAYS SUPPORT UR STOOD SUCCESS. THERE ARE COMING BACK. AND ARE VERY PROMISING AND SHOW THAT WE MUST CONTINUE ON THE PATH THAT WE ARE ON. OUR FIRST TIME FRESHMEN FOR YOUR GRAD RATE WENT FROM EIGHT POINT 5% AND TWENTY FIFTEEN TO TWENTY POINT FIRST TIME STUDENTS WENT FROM FORTY SIX PERCENT. TO FIFTY FOUR POINT 8% TO YOUR GRAD RATE- FOR TRANSFER STUDENTS WENT FROM TWENTY FIVE POINT SIX TO FORTY TWO POINT TWO PERCENT. AND THE TRANSFER FOR YOUR TRANSFER RATE- FROM SEVENTY ONE TO SEVENTY SEVEN PERCENT. WE ACHIEVE THESE RESULTS IN A NUMBER OF WAYS AS WELL AS SOME OTHER RESULTS ON A TALK ABOUT HERE IN A SECOND. FIRST OF ALL WE REALLY WANTED TO LOOK AT CHANGING THE MENTALITY OF EVERYBODY ON CAMPUS AND ALL OF OUR STUDENTS THAT WERE COMING IN. BY SAYING OUT LOUD WE YOU YOU CAN FINISH IN FOUR AND SO WE HAVE A PHOENICIAN FOR PROGRAM IN THE THROUGH INTO PROGRAM. WHERE STUDENTS WHO COME IN AND COMMIT TO TAKING FIFTEEN UNITS. SIGNING UP AND SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETING THIRTY UNITS CAN BE PART OF THIS PROGRAM. FOR SIMILAR TO OUR CALIFORNIA PROMISE I'LL TALK ABOUT OUR NUMBERS HERE IN A SECOND FACTORY A VERY LARGE NUMBER CALIFORNIA. PROMISE STUDENTS THAT ARE ALSO PART OF THIS PHOENICIAN FOR. PROGRAM WHAT WE SEE IS IN CHANGING THAT MINDSET AND IN FACT GOING TO WE HAVE WE TALK TO OUR ACADEMIC ADVISORS AND SAYING. WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT HOW DO WE GET YOU INTO FIVE CLASSES ARE FIFTEEN UNITS INSTEAD OF. TWELVE UNITS ARE NINE UNITS. IN CHANGE THAT MINDSET 80% OF OUR FRESHMAN NOW PLEDGE TO TAKE A FULL COURSE LOAD. THAT'S UP FROM 62% IN TWENTY SIXTEEN. 73% OF OUR FRESHMAN NOW TAKE FIFTEEN UNITS IN THE FIRST SEMESTER AND THAT'S UP 425% IN TWENTY FOURTEEN. SO IT'S BEEN A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT BY GETTING OUT FRONT OF THEM WHEN THEY COME FOR IN TATIAN AS WE GET THEM RIGHT THERE ON CAMPUS AND TALK TO THEM ABOUT WHAT IT MEANS TO BE. ABLE TO GET THROUGH. OUR CALVET THE PROBLEM PROGRAM. IN OF TWENTY NINETEEN. IS THAT'S ALRIGHT THE COMING ROAD THAT WAS AT YOUR IDEA THE NAME THE COMPANY PROMISED IT IT'S A TERM THAT USED THAT DESCRIBE LOTS OF THINGS THAT ARE LIFE AND SO. BUT IT WAS THE TERM USED IN THE LEGISLATION YES OKAY OKAY. AS MANY OTHER GREAT THINGS WE HAVE IN CALIFORNIA THIS IS ONE OF THEM AND WE'RE SEEING THE RESULTS ON OUR CAMPUSES WELL WE HAVE OVER SIX THOUSAND STUDENTS THAT ARE PART OF THE PROGRAM RIGHT NOW AND- WE HAVE OVER ELEVEN THOUSAND THAT ARE IN OUR PHOENICIAN FOR PROGRAM- AND AGAIN PLEASE KNOW THAT THE MAJORITY OF OUR- SIX THOUSAND CALIFORNIA PROMISE STUDENTS ARE ALSO IN THE- DEFINITION FOR- AND- AND THAT ELEVEN THOUSAND IS BOTH- FINISHING FOURTH THROUGH INTO PROGRAM SO WE- ARE ALSO LOOKING AT- TRANSFER STUDENTS. IN FALL TWENTY TWENTY SECOND A STATE WILL MERGE ARE TWO PROGRAMS TOGETHER SO THAT ALL THE BENEFITS OF EACH OF BE ABLE TO. ACCRUE TO THE STUDENTS THAT ARE PART OF IT- WE EXPECTED OVERALL PARTICIPATION RATE OF ABOUT 60% OR EIGHTY EIGHTEEN THOUSAND STUDENTS. ADDITIONALLY HAS WE MOVE INTO OUR FALL SEMESTER AND AS WE START BUILDING OUR SCHEDULES FOR UPCOMING FALL SEMESTER WILL WORK ON A NEW STRATEGIC SCHEDULING PROCESS. WHERE ARE INCOMING STUDENTS ARE GOING TO BE GIVEN A FIFTEEN MINUTE. LOAD BEFORE THEY GET THERE WITH COURSES THAT HAVE BEEN CHOSEN BY THE FACULTY IN THE PROGRAMS AT THEIR END TO SET THEM UP FOR THE HIGHEST PROBABILITY OF SUCCESS- THIS IS DOE IT'S OVER OTHER CAMPUSES ALREADY AND WE'RE JUST. WE'RE WE'RE GONNA BE IMPLEMENTING THAT THIS COMING YEAR. ENCOURAGING SO TO TAKE A FULL COURSE LOAD ONLY WORKS AS JAMES SAID IF THE COURSES ARE AVAILABLE TO THEM. WE'VE MADE IT A PRIORITY AND WE'VE MADE A VERY STRONG PRIORITY WE'VE CHANGED OUR INCENTIVE PROGRAMS BY THE WAY WE DO OUR BUDGET AND THE WAY WE ALLOCATE. OUT MONEY TO COLLEGES TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PRIORITY IS. THAT WE HAVE FACULTY THERE WE HAVE COURSES THERE ARE AVAILABLE TO OUR STUDENTS. WE'VE HIRED A NET INCREASE OF EIGHTY THREE TENURE TRACK FACULTY- THAT'S AFTER ACCOUNTING FOR RETIREMENT AND OTHER SEPARATIONS WITHOUT NEARLY TWO HUNDRED TENURE TRACK-HIGHER SINCE- TWENTY FOURTEEN. FIFTEEN WE'VE ADDED MORE THAN ELEVEN HUNDRED NEW COURSE SECTIONS WHICH MEANS WERE UP TO NINETY THREE HUNDRED COURSE SECTIONS FROM EIGHTY TWO HUNDRED. COURSE SECTIONS. THAT'S IN OVER 10% INCREASE INSTRUCTIONAL CAPACITY. FACTORY WERE HIRING AND COURSE ADDITIONS OF HELP US REDUCE IF NOT ELIMINATE IN ALMOST ALL AREAS THE NUMBER OF BOTTLENECK COURSES. THERE OFTEN STALLED- AND OF OFF INSTALLED THE PROGRESS OF OUR STUDENTS TO IT'S GONNA GRAY. MY OFFICE USED TO GET DOZENS OF CALLS- IN FACT AND I THINK IT'S FALL OF. ALL OF OUR STUDENTS. BEFORE THE FALL SEMESTER STARTED SAYING- LET US KNOW IF YOU THERE'S A CLASS THAT YOU NEED IN. A WE GOT A LOT OF EMAILS- GOT HUNDREDS OF THEM. LAST SEMESTER I GOT ONE- THIS MUST'VE HAD A HANDFUL MORE AND I'M I'M NOT LOSING MY SLEEP AND FIGURE OUT WHY IT'S GONE UP SINCE LAST SEMESTER- SO THE PROGRESS HAS BEEN DRAMATIC. I WAS GONNA ASK A CENTER LABOR I HOPE TO STOOD SHE'S HEARING FROM OR NOT FROM OUR AREA BECAUSE I HOPE THEY'RE NOT ON OUR CAMPUS- WE STILL HAVE SOME ISSUES AND THEIR IDIOSYNCRATIC MOVE AROUND PENDING ON. WHAT WE HAVE AVAILABILITY OF INSTRUCTORS AND LECTURES TO BE ABLE FILL SECTIONS. THAT WE NEED. WE KNOW THAT OUR STUDENTS ARE BUSY AND OFTEN HAVE COMPETING DEMANDS IN AND OUT OF THE CLASSROOM. THEREFORE WE'VE ENCOURAGED OUR STUDENTS TO UTILIZE SUMMER SESSION. TO CATCH UP AND STAY ON TRACK AND GET HAVE IN THEIR STUDIES. WE OFFER WHAT WE CALL A PROVOST SUMMER GRADUATION ASSISTANCE GRANTS. IS GRANTS ARE UP TO A THOUSAND DOLLARS AND ARE TARGETED TOWARDS STUDENTS NEAR GRADUATION OR WHO NEED SUMMER SCHOOL. OR SUMMER SESSION TO GET TO THIRTY UNITS IN THE ACADEMIC YEAR. WE NOW HAVE MORE THAN A THOUSAND ADDITIONAL STUDENTS TAKING SUMMER SESSION. EACH YEAR WHEN THIS YEAR WE HAD. THIRTY FIVE HUNDRED STUDENTS- IN TWENTY FIFTEEN WE HAVE THIRTY FIVE HUNDRED STUDENTS THIS YEAR AND FORTY SIX HUNDRED STUDENTS. ALLOCATED MORE THAN. TWO MILLION DOLLARS IN PROVENCE GRANTS OF THE LAST THREE YEARS. AND MORE THAN- TWENTY NINE HUNDRED STUDENTS TO RECEIVE SUCH GRANTS. MOST OF THIS ARE MUCH OF THIS IS COME FROM OUR GI TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. FUNDING AND SHOWN DRAMATIC RESULTS IN GETTING STUDENTS TO TAKE CLASSES THAT'LL HELP THEM. MOVE ALONG. WITH IMPROVED ARE ADVISING EFFORTS- BY HIRING ACADEMIC ADVISORS FELT. IT RISING CENTERS IN EACH COLLEGE. PROACTIVELY REACHING OUT TO STUDENTS AND WE CAN USE A LOT OF TECH. G. TWO. DOWN STUDENTS THAT ARE EITHER GOING BEHIND. NEED TO BE READY. FOR BUT WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO PROACTIVELY REACH OUT TO THEM ON INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND SAY. WE NOTICED THAT YOU ARE ON TRACK BUT YOU'RE NOT IN THIS CLASS THAT WE HAVE SEATS AND- ARE YOU INTERESTED IN BEING OUT OF THAT SO WERE WERE USING OUR COLLEGE SUCCESS CENTERS TO REACH OUT TO STUDENTS. ON A PERSON BY PERSON BASIS. I WE'VE GOT DIRECT SERVICES MENTORING FOR DIFFERENT STUDENT GROUPS AND WE USE STUDENT MENTORS AND STUDENT TUTORS TO HELP SUPPLEMENT. OUR SHORTFALL IN ACADEMIC ADVISORS THAT WERE EXPERIENCING EVERYWHERE. AS I SAID WE'RE ALSO EXPERIMENTING WITH STRATEGIC SCHEDULING OR WE'RE CERTAIN THAT THAT'S GONNA MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE. MUCH OF WHAT WE HAVE DONE COULD NOT HAVE BEEN DONE WITHOUT INVESTING IN TECHNOLOGY ECOSYSTEM- DATA DESERVED. DECISION DATA DRIVEN DECISION MAKING TO IMPROVE CAMPUS EFFICIENCIES AND THE STUDENT EXPERIENCE WE'VE GOT A- AN ECOSYSTEM OF DIFFERENT PROGRAMS THAT TALK TO EACH OTHER THAT HELP US LOOK AT WHAT. STUDENTS NEEDS ARE WHERE THEY ARE IN THEIR DEGREE PROGRAM- WHERE THEY ARE ALREADY SAID THAT THEY WANT TO TAKE COURSES AND THEN WE FEED THAT TO OUR DEPARTMENT CHAIRS. TO MAKE SURE OF THOSE COURSES ARE THERE AVAILABLE TO THEM WHEN THEY NEED THEM AND SO. WE'VE WE'VE TAKEN A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT PROGRAMS TO GET THEM TOGETHER AND TALK AND GET THE INFORMATION WE NEED TO GET OUR STUDENTS WHAT THEY NEED- WHEN THEY NEED IT. WE'RE ALSO EXCITED ABOUT OUR PROGRESS- AND PAYING SPECIAL ATTENTION TO CLOSING THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP IS A MORAL IMPERATIVE ON ALL OF OUR CAMPUSES. WE CLOSED OUR ARE UNDERREPRESENTED MINORITY GAP- FOR THE SIX YEAR GRADUATION RATE AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN- THAT CLOSURE OPEN BACK UP AGAIN- LAST YEAR. AND WHEN WE LOOKED BACK. WE THINK IT WAS A COHORT OF STUDENTS THAT THAT WE GOT THAT CAME TO US THIS IS OUR SIX YEAR GRAD RATE. THAT CAME TO US- BEFORE WE STARTED OUR GRADUATION INITIATIVE PLANS THAT WE LOST THEM BEFORE WE COULD EVER REALLY. INTERACT WITH THEM WITH OUR NEW SYSTEMS AND SO WE THINK WE'RE BACK ON TRACK AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO. THAT GOING BACK DOWN AGAIN STARTING NEXT YEAR. FOR YOUR GRADUATION RATES FOR A NUMBER OF STUDENT ETHNIC AND SOCIO ECONOMIC COHORTS OF GREATLY IMPROVED. THE RISING TIDE IS LIFTING ALL BOATS. I'M GONNA NOTICES PICK TWO OR THREE BUT I'M NOT ON A PECKHAM LL BECAUSE THEY'RE ALL REALLY GOOD- IF WE LOOK AT FOR YOUR GRADUATION RATES THEY'VE TRIPLED FOR MANY GROUPS OR SPANDEX STUDENTS WAS. EIGHT POINT 6% IS NOW TWENTY POINT ONE PERCENT. ASIAN AMERICAN PACIFIC ISLANDER WAS FIVE AND A HALF PERCENT IT'S NOT SIXTEEN POINT 3% AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDENTS FOR YOUR GRADUATION RATE WAS FOUR POINT 3% IT'S NOT TWELVE POINT SEVEN PERCENT. PALATABLE STUDENTS WAS FIVE POINT 5% NOW 16% FIRST GENERATION STUDENTS WENT FROM FOUR POINT SEVEN TO A SEVENTEEN POINT ONE. AND OUR MALE STUDENTS WENT FROM SIX POINT SIX TO FIFTEEN POINT ONE. SO ACROSS ALL- WAIT THAT WE LOOK AT IT GRADUATION RATES HAVE INCREASED. BUT THEY STILL-PERSIST AT LOWER RATES THAN WE WANT THEM TO BE IN LOWER RATES THAN OTHER COHORTS OF STUDENTS THAT WE HAVE. AND WE'RE DOING% EVERYTHING WE CAN TO ELIMINATE THOSE ACHIEVEMENT GAPS. OUR EFFORTS OF BETA SO NATIONAL MODELS IN AT IN MANY WAYS WERE PLEASE BY THE RECOGNITION WE RECEIVED WE GOT AND ASK YOU AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF STATE COLLEGES UNIVERSITIES EXCELLENCE. IN INNOVATION AWARD- BUT WE'RE ONLY GETTING STARTED- WE'RE VERY VERY EXCITED ABOUT WHAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO DO. AS OUR EFFORTS ARE SUSTAIN FOR THE FRESHMEN AND TRANSFER STUDENTS ARRIVE ON OUR CAMPUS THIS FALL. UNDER THE CLASS OF TWENTY TWENTY BANNER WELCOMING THEM WE'RE PROUD THE ENVIRONMENT WE'VE CREATED FORM. IS THE FIRST FULL YEAR OF STUDENTS IN ALL OF OUR STUDENTS WILL BE. IMPACTED BY THE EFFORTS THAT WE'VE MADE OVER THE LAST FOUR YEARS- AND WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING THE RESULTS. HERE'S THE PART THAT- I ADDED IN ALL THIS IS A STORY BEEN LOOKING FOR TO TOWN FOR YEARS. WE CANNOT A SYSTEM IN STATE AND TO. ALL OF OUR EFFORTS AND RESOURCES TO BETTER SERVE OUR STUDENTS. AND IT'S WORKING. WE'RE SHOWING WHAT IT TAKES TO EDUCATE THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA AND CHANGE THE TRAJECTORY OF THEIR LIVES AND THOSE OF THEIR FAMILIES AND THEIR COMMUNITIES. WE CANNOT GO BACKWARDS. WE MUST REMEMBER THAT NONE OF THE ACTIONS THAT WE HAVE TAKEN. OUR COST FREE. THEY REQUIRED ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT FOR OUR CAMPUS FROM THE STATE AND FROM THE CSU SYSTEM. WE'VE DONE IT ON ONE TIME FUNDING THAT WE WILL NOT HAVE FOREVER WE'VE DONE ON RESERVE BALANCES THAT WE WILL NOT HAVE FOREVER WE CANNOT GO BACKWARDS WE'VE CHANGED THE CULTURE ON OUR CAMPUSES WOULD CHANGE THE CULTURE OF OUR STUDENTS. AND IF WE RETREAT FROM THAT CHANGE IN CULTURE I DON'T KNOW HOW WE RECOVER FROM THAT. THE CLASSES WITH ADDED OVER THAT LAST YEAR'S MUST CONTINUE. THE SUMMER A MUST CONTINUE. THE IMPROVE ADVISING MODELS MUST GO ON. AS I SAID EARLIER 80% OF OUR INCOMING STUDENTS ARE PLEDGING TO TAKE A FULL COURSE LOAD AND WE HAVE TO BE THERE TO. OFFER THAT TO THEM. THE PLAN FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE ACADEMIC YEAR WE NEED CONFIDENCE. THAT WILL HAVE THAT FUNDING THERE TO BE ABLE TO MAKE SURE STUDENTS HAVE WITHIN IT. REALLY APPRECIATE THE TIME TO TALK WITH YOU HAPPENING ATTORNEY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU AT DR PER AS- I UNDERSTAND WHY YOU WERE SO EXCITED TO COME HERE AT THE STORIES AND AT. THAT YOU HAVE SHARED ARE INSPIRING AND- REALLY CONFIDENT. BUILDING BECAUSE- OF EACH SACRAMENTO STATE UNDER YOUR LEADERSHIP UNDER PRESIDENT NELSON'S LEADERSHIP HAVE REALLY BEEN ALL STARS IN OUR STATE. AND SET GREAT EXAMPLES FOR- WHERE THAT COMMITMENT IN THAT LEADERSHIP CAN PRODUCE HUGE RESULTS FOR OUR STUDENTS HUGE. BECAUSE FOR EVERY STUDENT A DROPS OUT IT'S A TRAGEDY THAT'S RIGHT DEBT. AND NO DEGREE AND- I CERTAINLY WOULD'VE UNDERSCORE THE- EXCITEMENT AT CLOSING THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP AND HEARING THOSE TROUBLING TO REALLY TRIPLING OF NUMBERS AND FIVE YEARS FOR. SO MANY DIFFERENT CLASSES OF STUDENTS- IS JUST VERY IMPRESSIVE AND THANK YOU FOR SHARING YOUR STORY MIGHT HAVE SOME FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS AS WE- GO THROUGH THE OUT THE AFTERNOON THANK YOU APPRECIATE. YOUR JOINED BY ANOTHER CAMPUS LEADER FROM SAN JOSE STATE. THAT IS ALSO MADE GREAT PROGRESS IN THAT THE CALIFORNIA PROMISE PROGRAM IN THE FOUR YEAR GRADUATION- PROGRAM- DR SALLY- HAD NOT NOTICE. AND WE WELCOME YOU HERE WE THANK YOU ON BEHALF OF YOUR INSTITUTION FOR SHARING YOUR STORY. US THANK YOU SENATOR GLAZER AND SENATOR ALLEN. I THANK YOU FOR GIVING ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS THE REMARKABLE PROGRESS THAT WE'VE MADE TOWARDS OUR GOALS OF GRADUATION INITIATIVE TWENTY TWENTY FIVE AT TEN OF THE STATE AND IT'S REALLY GRATIFYING FOR ME TO BE ABLE TO HEAR FROM ONE OF MY SISTER CAMPUSES AND SEE THAT WE ARE SHARING A LOT OF ST THE SAME PRACTICES AND SEEING THE SAME OUTCOME SO THAT'S VERY REINFORCING FOR ME. TO SEE THAT IT'S WORKING EVERYWHERE. GRADUATION INITIATIVE TWENTY TWENTY FIVE HAS GIVEN US AN OPPORTUNITY TO CRITICALLY EXAMINE. CURRICULUM ADVISING. ENROLLMENT MANAGEMENT STUDENT SUPPORT SERVICES. COURSE SCHEDULING. AND ADMINISTRATIVE ROAD BLOCKS WITH THE GOAL OF SMOOTHING THE PATH FOR STUDENTS TO EXCESS COULD SUCCEED. IN THEIR MAJORS AND GRADUATE IN A TIMELY FASHION. A WHEN WE BEGAN THE GRADUATION INITIATIVE IN TWENTY TWENTY FIVE AS YOU TALKED ABOUT EARLIER ARE FOR YOUR GRADUATION RATE HAD HARBORED STUBBORNLY NEAR ABOUT RAISED THE FOUR YEAR GRADUATION RATE TO TWENTY FIVE PERCENT. THIS TRANSLATES AT SAN JOSE STATE TO FIVE HUNDRED ADDITIONAL FRESHMAN PER YEAR COMPLETING THEIR DEGREE IN FOUR YEARS. THE STUDENTS ARE GRADUATING WITH LESS DEBT WHILE AT THE SAME TIME BENEFITING FROM BEGINNING GRADUATESCHOOL OR THEIR CRICKET. CAREER TRAJECTORIES EARLIER. I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT NO SINGLE STRATEGY IS RESPONSIBLE FOR IMPROVING THE STUDENT EXPERIENCE AND RAISING GRADUATION RATES. INSTEAD MANY CHANGES BIG AND SMALL HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE FIFTEEN PERCENTAGE POINT INCREASE. ACTIONS A SMALLISH CHANGING A DEADLINE. OR AS SIGNIFICANT AS TRIPLING THE NUMBER OF ADVISERS EACH RAISE THE GRADUATION AND RETENTION RATES A LITTLE BIT. EVERY DIVISION ON OUR CAMPUS IS ENGAGED IN THIS EFFORT AND THE STE AND STUDENT SUCCESS IS EMBEDDED IN OUR TRANSFORMATION TWENTY THIRTY STRATEGIC PLAN. I WOULD LIKE TO SHARE WITH YOU SOME SPECIFIC STRATEGIES THAT HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO MORE THAN DOUBLING OUR FOUR YEAR GRADUATION RATE IN JUST FOUR YEARS. FIRST AND WE TALKED ABOUT THIS IT A LOT BUT- IT'S VERY VERY IMPORTANT WHICH IS INCREASING THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS TAKING A FULL LOAD OF FIFTEEN UNITS PER SEMESTER. SECOND INCREASING THE RATIO OF ADVISERS TO STUDENTS AND DEVELOPING ROBUST ELECTRONIC ADVISING TOOLS WHICH WAS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT SENATOR ROTH WAS INTERESTED IN. AND THE THIRD RETHINKING HOW WE DELIVER CURRICULUM. ONE OF THE BEHAVIORS THAT EXTENDS STUDENTS TIME TO COMPLETION OF THEIR DEGREES IS TAKING TOO FEW UNITS. IF A STUDENT PLANS TO COMPLETE A FOR A DEGREE IN FOUR YEARS SHE MUST EARN THIRTY UNITS PER YEAR. TYPICALLY THIS IS DONE BY TAKING FIFTEEN UNITS EACH SEMESTER BUT IN FALL FIFTEEN. ONLY 19% OF OUR FIRST TIME FRESHMEN TOOK A FULL LOAD OF FIFTEEN UNITS. WE ARE DELIGHTED TO REPORT THAT FOR FALL TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN THAT PROPORTION HAS INCREASED TO FIFTY FOUR PERCENT. A CLOSE TO THREE FOLD INCREASE. A STUDENT EARNING TWELVE UNITS EACH SEMESTER IS UP IS FULL TIME. FROM A FINANCIAL AID PERSPECTIVE BUT IS ON A PATH TO GRADUATE IN FIVE YEARS INSTEAD OF FOR. THAT EXTRA YEAR ADDS TWENTY NINE THOUSAND DOLLARS IN FEES AND LIVING EXPENSES NOT TO MENTION THE OPPORTUNITY COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH A DELAYED START TO ONE'S CAREER. INCREASING AVERAGE UNIT LOAD HAS BEEN A MAJOR CULTURE SHIFT FOR STUDENTS ADMINISTRATORS ADVISORS AND FACULTY REQUIRING CHANGES IN ATTITUDES AND BELIEFS AS WELL AS POLICIES AND PRACTICES THAT CREATE BARRIERS AND I THINK YOU MENTIONED THE SAME THING AT SACRAMENTO STATE. WITH FUNDS FROM GRADUATION INITIATIVE TWENTY TWENTY FIVE WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO HIRE MORE FACULTY TO OFFER MORE SECTIONS AND THUS REDUCE WEIGHT LESS AND BOTTLENECKS THAT PREVENT STUDENTS FROM TAKING A FULL FIFTEEN UNITS. LIKE OTHER CAMPUSES IN THE CSU WE'VE INITIATED A PHOENICIAN FOUR CAMPAIGN FOR FRESHMAN AND IT TAKE TO CAMPAIGN FOR TRANSFER STUDENTS ALONG WITH MESSAGING TO STUDENTS AND THEIR PARENTS ABOUT THE BENEFITS OF COMPLETING THIRTY UNITS PER YEAR. WE ARE MORE STRATEGIC ABOUT THE COURSES WE OFFER IN WINTER AND SUMMER SESSION BY TARGETING COURSES THAT ARE IMPORTANT PRE REQUISITES OR THAT TEND TO HAVE UNMET DEMAND DURING THE FALL AND SPRING SEMESTERS. WE'VE DEVELOPED TWO YEAR AND FOUR YEAR ROAD MAPS FOR ALL UNDERGRADUATE DEGREES AND PROGRAMS THEM INTO OUR ELECTRONIC DEGREE PLANNER CALLED MY PLANNER. STUDENTS AND ADVISORS USE MY PLANNER TO INSTANTANEOUSLY SEE THE IMPACT OF OPTING TO EITHER TAKE OR DELAYED TAKING A PARTICULAR COURSE AT ANY POINT IN THEIR PROGRAM. TO CREATE INCENTIVES FOR STUDENTS TO COMPLETE THIRTY UNITS PER YEAR SAN JOSE STATES CALIFORNIA PROMISE PROGRAM WAS DESIGNED TO CAST A WIDE NET. GIVING ANY CALIFORNIA RESIDENT WHO WANTS TO MAKE THE PLEDGE PERMISSION TO JOIN. CALIFORNIA PROMISE STUDENTS ARE REQUIRED TO ATTEND A WORKSHOP TO CREATE A TWO OR FOUR YEAR PLANNER. A PLAN IN MY PLANNER. AND BENEFIT FROM EARLY REGISTRATION TO HELP THEM TO GET THE CLASSES THEY NEED AT THE TIMES THEY PREFER AND I I'M NEED TO CLARIFY THE TO YOUR PLAN IS FOR TRANSFER STUDENTS AND A FOR YOUR PLAN IS FOR. SOMEONE WHO COMES AS A FRESHMAN. WE CREATE WE RECRUIT STUDENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES INTO THE PROGRAM AT SPARTAN ADMIT DAY AND DURING OUR OUT REACHED A HIGH SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES ALL OVER THE STATE. AS OF SPRING TWENTY TWENTY WE HAVE SIXTEEN HUNDRED STUDENTS IN THE CALIFORNIA PROMISE PROGRAM. ADVISERS MONITOR STUDENT PROGRESS TO ENSURE THEY SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETE. THIRTY UNITS PER YEAR. IF THEY ARE NOT ON TRACK TO COMPLETE THIRTY UNITS DURING THE ACADEMIC YEAR WE ENCOURAGE THEM TO TAKE SUMMER OR WINTER CLASSES. IF STUDENTS DON'T MEET THEIR PLEDGE AND THAT'S OR DESCEND ROLE FROM THE PROGRAM THEY HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO RE ENTER AT A LATER TIME IF THEY MEET ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS. WE'VE INVESTED HEAVILY IN ACADEMIC ADVISING. IN FALL TWENTY FIFTEEN. THE UNIVERSITY HAD ONE FULL TIME STAFF ADVISER FOR EVERY EIGHTEEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY STUDENTS. WITH THE HELP OF GRADUATION INITIATIVE TWENTY TWENTY FIVE FUNDING. WE HAVE TRIPLED THE NUMBER OF ADVISERS AND TODAY WE HAVE ONE ADVISER FOR EVERY SIX HUNDRED STUDENTS. WE HAVE A STUDENT SUCCESS CENTER IN EACH OF OUR SEVEN ACADEMIC COLLEGES THAT PROVIDES A RANGE OF SERVICES INCLUDING ACADEMIC ADVISING CAREER ADVISING. STUDENT SUCCESS WORKSHOPS AND TUTORING. WE HOLD REGULAR PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES FOR ADVISORS AND HAVING ADVISING COUNCIL THAT MEETS ON A REGULAR BASIS TO DISCUSS ADVISING GOALS STRATEGIES AND BEST PRACTICES AS WELL AS OBSTACLES TO DELIVERING HIGH QUALITY ADVISING SERVICES. WE HAVE BUILT AN ELECTRONIC ADVISING TOOL CALLED MY PROGRESS THAT STUDENTS CAN RUN ANY TIME OF DAY OR NIGHT TO REVIEW WHICH DEGREE REQUIREMENTS THEY'VE COMPLETED. AND WHICH THEY STILL NEED TO COMPLETE IF A STUDENT THINKS A REQUIREMENT HAS BEEN MET YET IT'S STILL SHOWING READ IN MY PROGRESS THE STUDENT CAN IMMEDIATELY BING THE DISCREPANCY TO AN ADVISER. TODAY TOGETHER THEY CAN DETERMINE IF A TRANSCRIPT IS MISSING OR THE STUDENT HAS AN ALTERNATIVE COURSE WORK THAT COULD BE SUBSTITUTED TO MEET THAT REQUIREMENT. A REVIEW OF MIKE PROGRESS EACH SEMESTER ELIMINATE SURPRISES AT THE LAST MINUTE THAT COULD DELAY STUDENTS GRADUATION. ANOTHER ELECTRONIC ADVISING TOOL SPARTAN CONNECT ALLOWS FACULTY AND ACADEMIC ADVISORS TO IDENTIFY STUDENTS WHO ARE STRUGGLING AND CONNECT THEM WITH THE SERVICES THEY NEED SUCH AS TUTORING WORKSHOPS PEER MENTORS AND COUNSELING SERVICES. PERHAPS ONE OF THE MOST INSPIRING PROJECTS HAS BEEN THE REVISION OF OUR CURRICULUM TO REPLACE NON CREDIT BEARING REMEDIAL MATH AND WRITTEN COMMUNICATION COURSE WORK WAS SUPPORTED INSTRUCTION AND I THINK THIS WAS ONE OF YOUR- BABIES. AND IT'S BEEN REMARKABLE WHAT'S GOING ON. THIS PROJECT WAS INITIATED IN AUGUST. TWENTY SEVENTEEN IN RESPONSE TO EXECUTIVE ORDER ELEVEN TEN FROM THE CSU CHANCELLOR. WITH FUNDS FROM GRADUATION INITIATIVE TWENTY TWENTY FIVE SAN JOSE STATE FACULTY HAVE DEVELOPED CO REQUISITE WORKSHOPS AND STRETCH COURSES. TO ASSIST STUDENTS AND THEIR COLLEGE LEVEL MATH AND WRITING. A STRETCH COURSE EXTENDS THE CONTENT OVER TWO SEMESTERS TO PROVIDE STUDENTS MORE TIME TO MASTER THE MATERIAL. FACULTY HAVE DEVELOPED NEW COURSES SUCH AS MATHEMATICS IN ART AND MUSIC AND MATHEMATICS AND POLITICS ONE THAT I THINK YOU WOULD PROBABLY ENJOY TAKING. A TO PROVIDE EXCITING ALTERNATIVES TO BASIC ALGEBRA. WEATHER IS STUDENTS PURSUING A CALCULUS BASED OR STATISTICS BASED DEGREE PROGRAM OR PROGRAM IN WHICH GENERAL EDUCATION MATH IS THE ONLY QUANTITATIVE REASONING REQUIREMENT WE HAVE CREATED SUPPORT PAT SUPPORTED PATHWAYS THAT ALIGN WITH THE LEVEL OF EACH STUDENT'S PREPARATION WHEN THEY ARRIVE AT SAN JOSE STATE. A STUDENT WHO'S HIGH SCHOOL PREPARATION INDICATE SHE'S READY FOR COLLEGE LEVEL MATH MIGHT JUMP RIGHT INTO STATISTICS ANOTHER STUDENT WHOSE PREPARATION INDICATE SUPPORT IS NEEDED WOULD TAKE THE STRETCH VERSION OF STATISTICS. SIMILARLY STUDENTS CAN TAKE A ONE SEMESTER ENGLISH ONE A COURSE OR A STRETCH VERSION IF THEY FEEL THEY NEED MORE READING AND WRITING SUPPORT. IN THE WRITING ARENA WE'VE USED GRADUATION TWENTY ADDITION OF TWENTY TWENTY FIVE FUNDS TO PROVIDE PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT FOR FACULTY TO INTEGRATE READING APPRENTICESHIP TEACHING FRAMEWORKS INTO OUR ENGLISH ONE EIGHT COURSES. READING APPRENTICESHIP IS A RESEARCH BASED ODEL THAT HELP STUDENTS LEARN HOW TO MONITOR THEIR COMPREHENSION AND HOW TO RESTORE IT WHEN IT BREAKS DOWN. READING COMPREHENSION IS ESSENTIAL TO SUCCESS IN UNDERSTANDING COLLEGE LEVEL TEXT. GRADUATION INITIATIVE TWENTY TWENTY FIVE HAS ALLOWED US TO HIRE PEER EDUCATORS AS TUTORS AND AS MENTORS IN THE FIRST YEAR MATH AND WRITING COURSES. THESE MENTORS MENTORS GO BEYOND TUTORING CONTENT THEY HELP STUDENTS WITH COLLEGE SUCCESS SKILLS SUCH AS- STUDY STRATEGIES TIME MANAGEMENT AND ENGAGEMENT WITH CAMPUS RESOURCES AND ACTIVITIES. I'M REALLY EXCITED TO BE ABLE TO TELL YOU THE RESULTS OF THIS INTENSIVE WORK. OUR GOAL IS TO ENSURE THAT ALL STUDENTS SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETE THEIR GENERAL EDUCATION WRITTEN AND MATHEMATICS REQUIREMENTS IN THEIR FIRST YEAR AT SAN JOSE STATE. MATH AND WRITING ARE FOUNDATIONAL SKILLS THAT SUPPORT STUDENT SUCCESS IN SUBSEQUENT COURSES. OF THE FRESHMEN WHO ENTERED IN FALL TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN ONE YEAR AGO. 91% COMPLETED THEIR G. G. E. WRITTEN A COMMUNICATION REQUIREMENT IN THEIR FIRST YEAR THE YEAR BEFORE THAT TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN ONLY 72% ARE COMPLETED THEIR WRITTEN RICK COMMUNICATION REQUIREMENTS A YEAR TO YEAR GAIN OF NINETEEN PERCENTAGE POINTS. IN MATH THE NEWS IS EVEN MORE COMPELLING. FALL TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN COMPLETED THEIR G. E. QUANTITATIVE REASONING REQUIREMENT COMPARED TO ONLY FALL SEVENTEEN A YEAR TO YEAR GAIN OF TWENTY EIGHT PERCENTAGE POINTS. THESE STUDENTS OF MASTER KEY SKILLS THAT THEY WILL CONTINUE TO APPLY TO THEIR COURSE WORK AS THEY COMPLETE THEIR DEGREES IN CLOSING WE ARE PROUD OF THE PROGRESS WE'VE MADE A TENNESSEE STATE WITH CONTINUED GRADUATION INITIATIVE. TO OF TWENTY TWENTY FIVE SUPPORT WE ARE CONFIDENT THAT WE CAN MEET OUR GRADUATION RATE GOALS FOR FRESHMEN AND TRANSFER STUDENTS OF COURSE WE STILL HAVE WORK TO DO. THIS YEAR WE ARE FOCUSING OUR ATTENTION ON STRATEGIES TO REDUCE EQUITY GAPS AND INCREASE FIRST YEAR RETENTION RATES THE DATA SHOW THAT ONE STUDENTS COMPLETE THEIR FIRST TWO YEARS THERE IS A 90% CHANCE THAT THEY WILL COMPLETE THEIR DEGREES WHILE ALL OF OUR STUDENTS ARE SUCCEEDING AT HIGHER RATES. THE EQUITY GAPS ARE STUBBORN AND WE NEED TO PAY ATTENTION TO STRATEGIES TO REDUCE THE GAPS. IN YOUR PACKET WE- PROVIDED YOU A PLAN THAT SUMMARIZES OUR STRATEGIES FOR THIS YEAR TO CONTINUE OUR POSITIVE MOMENTUM IN ADDRESSING OUR STUDENT NEEDS AND CREATING AN AND COLLUSIVE AND WELCOMING EDUCATIONAL ENVIRONMENT SAN JOSE STATE SO THANK YOU FOR LETTING ME SHARE OUR STORY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH A DOCTOR DIAGNOSE- AND CERTAINLY OUR THANKS TO PRESIDENT OF THE PAYS IAN AND TO YOUR FACULTY YOU KNOW THESE THINGS ARE EASY AND- IT CERTAINLY- AT THE FOR THE PROGRESS WITH FOR FRESHMAN UNIT LOAD AND WHAT YOU'VE DONE WITH ADVISING. AND YEAH THERE'S SO MANY THERE'S SO MANY THINGS AND YOU SAID AT THE BEGINNING YOUR TESTIMONY THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS LITTLE THINGS THAT SOME HELP TOGETHER TURN INTO BIG THINGS AND- AND IT TAKES A LOT OF WORK AND IT MAY IT GOT OF. A FEW PEOPLE OUT OF THEIR COMFORT ZONE I KNOW SENATOR ALLEN AND I- HAD A HEARING ON THE WHOLE CHANGE IN REMEDIATION- AND THERE WAS A LOT OF RESISTANCE TO THAT AND DID REQUIRE A LOT OF WORK FROM. THE FACT TO REDUCE. CORE BUT I THINK IT WAS A- A FOR SITE OUT FAR SIGHTED AND- WE IN ESSENCE A BRILLIANT. PLAN THAT THE CHANCE SO WHY A DOCTOR MINOR. THAT YOU ALL ADVANCED AND I KNOW HOW HARD IT WAS BUT I THINK YOU WERE SEEN IN THE PROGRESS- WHERE STUDENTS. ARE TAKING COURSES THAT. CONTRIBUTE TO THEIR GRADUATION NOT CREATE A SITUATION LIKE YOURS STALLED. AND YOU'RE NOT REALLY AND THAT IN THE COLLEGE ELAINE YET AND THE THINGS THAT- NEGATIVELY AFFECT THEIR COMMITMENT TO. ADVANCING TOWARDS THEIR DEGREES SO- MATHEMATICS IN POLITICS WE COULD USE THAT AROUND HERE BY THE WAY. I'D LIKE TO GO TAKE THAT COURSE MAYBE WE'RE ALREADY TAKEN IT I'M NOT SURE- WELL I WANT TO AT. I WANT HAD SOME QUESTIONS FOR DOCTOR MINOR AND- I. YEAH WE'RE CELEBRATING THESE TWO CAMPUS SUCCESSES AND IN THE MATERIALS THAT HAVE BEEN PREPARED BY STAFF AND I CERTAINLY WANT TO THANK STOCKS YOU ALL YET FROM MY TEAM WHO PUT THIS. TOGETHER BUT THERE IS A CHART HERE IN RED. WHICH THAT SHOWS THAT THE DISSIPATION BY CAMPUS IN THE CALIFORNIA PROBLEMS PROGRAM. ALEC KNOWLEDGE AGAIN THAT THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS THAT GO INTO THE SUCCESSES THAT WE'VE HAD. AND THE CAL PROMISE PROGRAM WHERE IT'S STUDENTS COMMIT TO TAKING THE UNIT COUNT THAT WE PROVIDE REGISTRATION PRIORITY ADVISING. THAT'S JUST A THAT'S A PIECE THAT'S JUST A PIECE OF FIVE WHERE WE CAN POTENTIALLY SEE PROGRESS AND WE LOOK AT THIS CHART YOU CAN SEE- THAT WHILE THE MANY CAMPUSES OF COMMITTED TO THE PROGRAM- ONLY IF YOU HAVE REALLY COMMITTED WHOLEHEARTEDLY TO IT AND TWO OF THEM ARE HERE SAN JOSE STATE. SACRAMENTO STATE LONG BEACH STATE WHERE WE SEE SOME REALLY SIGNIFICANT NUMBERS- IN ENROLLING IN THE PROMISE PROGRAM AND YET FOR SO MANY OF THE OTHER CAMPUSES- IT THE BUT SUFFICIENT RATE IS BEEN VERY LOW AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE CAMPUS IS THAT IT. HAD DONE SO POORLY IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS- EAST BAY CAL STATE EAST BAY- YOU KNOW HOW MANY STUDENTS ARE IN THIS PROGRAM SIXTY- WHEN YOU LOOK AT THAT. FRESNO ONLY A HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE STUDENTS THIS YEAR IN A MID SIZE CAMPUS SIMILAR TO SACRAMENTO STATE ONLY A HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE. COMPARE THAT TO SACRAMENTO STATE WITH WHAT TWENTY HUNDRED AND FORTY TWO. THEIR PROMISE PROGRAM IT'S A MASSIVE THAT'S A MASSIVE DIFFERENCE. SO DOCTOR MINOR CAN YOU SPEAK TO I WOULD NOW CELEBRATED THE SUCCESSES AND WE TALKED ABOUT THE TOOLS THAT HAVE ALLOWED IT TO HAPPEN AND HOW WE HAVE TO KEEP IT GOING. IN REGARD TO OUR BUDGET- AS EVER AT AND OTHER THINGS BUT- CAN YOU SPEAK TO I KNOW THE COMMITMENT IN LEGISLATION WEST WAS AT SEVEN. FOR YOU KNOW FOR FRESHMAN PROGRAMS AND YOU'VE DONE MORE BUT YET WE'RE NOT SEEING THAT THE DISSIPATION RATE AND SO MANY FIFTY TWO COULD YOU SPEAK TO THAT. YEAH THANK YOU SENATOR I AYE A WILL AND AS YOU ALL THIS IS A CONVERSATION THAT WE HAVE BEEN HAVING SYSTEM WIDE. THERE THERE ARE FEW. VERY ASKING. ARE WORTHY OF SO DESCRIBE NOW CERTAINLY A- MY- TO. THAT SIX. BUT WHEN YOU'RE TODAY THAT IS BRANDING I THINK MANY OF OUR CAMPUSES HAD A WAR OR EXISTING PROGRAMS THAT MAY HAVE BEEN SIMILAR SERVE SIMILAR FUNCTIONS. PRIOR TO THE LEGISLATION AND YOUR NOW STARTING TO SEE SOME CAMPUSES MERCH PROGRAMS THAT MAY HAVE BEEN BRANDED DIFFERENTLY FIFTEEN TO FINISH. ALL THE WORSE CALIFORNIA PROMISE. LIKE BUT NOT BRANDED AS SUCH AND SO WEST CAMPUSES ARE. COUNTING THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS PARTICIPATING IN THIS PROGRAM OR THAT PROGRAM STUDENTS WHO MAY BE. EXPERIENCING THE BENEFITS OF A SIMILAR PROGRAM. MAY NOT BE REGISTERED OR ROLLED SO THAT THAT'S ONE ELEMENT THAT I THINK. IS WORTHY OF DISCUSSION THE OTHER IS SOME VARIATION AND CRITERIA. WHAT WE'RE LEARNING FROM OUR CAMPUSES THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS WHO WHEN PRESENTED WITH THE OPPORTUNITY- STEVE MENTIONED THE CULTURE CHANGES THAT ARE HAPPENING. NOT ONLY WITH THE FACULTY AND STAFF BUT ALSO WITH OUR STUDENTS IN TERMS OF WHAT KIND OF EXPECTATIONS- WE HAVE FOR THEM UPON ARRIVAL IS INTERESTING I THINK. ROUGHLY ASK THEM HOW MANY EXPECT TO GRADUATE IN FOUR YEARS ABOUT SAT AND SPOKE WITH THOSE STUDENTS ABOUT WHAT'S TECHNICALLY NECESSARY IN ORDER FOR THAT TO HAPPEN MANY OF- ARE SORT OF ON AWARE AND THAT DOESN'T EVEN ACCOUNT FOR. NOT BEING ABLE TO GET A COURSE IN A pIT- OR THE EXPECTATION THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE ENROLLED IN MAKING SUCH A WHAT BUT MAY SEEM LIKE A SIGNIFICANT COMMITMENT IN THEIR FIRST YEAR. SO THERE'S JUST SOME- ENGAGEMENT THAT WE HAVE TO DO AND WITH RESPECT TO ADVISE AND IN A ROW TO STUDENTS IN THE PROGRAM. THE OTHER VARIABLE I WILL MENTION IS THE ABILITY OF STUDENTS WHO MAKE THE PLAY AT AGE. IN YEAR ONE OR TERM ONE. ROOM ON TRACK. AND THREE SEMESTER FOR SEMESTER FIVE. SO IN ANY GIVEN TERM WE'RE WE'RE COUNTY HOW MANY STUDENTS ARE PARTICIPATING. THERE IS SOME ATTRITION THAT WE HAVE TO ACCOUNT FOR- THE FINAL THING THAT I WILL MENTION AND I DON'T KNOW THAT THIS REPRESENTS AN ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM. IS THAT THE INSTITUTIONAL COMMITMENT TO FOR FIELD A PROMISE AND I AND I KNOW THAT THAT IS A DELICATE AND SENSITIVE ISSUE. BUT IT IS- VARIABLE AND IN TERMS OF HOW YOU SEE SOME VARIATION IN AND HOW STUDENTS ARE PARTICIPATING. AND I THINK I'D LIKE TO DRAFT ON THAT LAST POINT BECAUSE I RECOGNIZE. THAT THAT REALLY. THAT YEAH THERE'S A COMMITMENT ON- ON THE STUDENT'S PART WHEN THEY SAY I WANT TO GET OUT IN FOUR YEARS. AND I'M COMMITTING TO TRY TO TAKE THE UNIT COUNT TO GET OUT AND THAT'S A COMMITMENT. AND THE INSTITUTION SAYING OKAY WE'RE GONNA GET YOU MAKE SURE YOU'RE GONNA GET THE CLASSES YOU NEED AND YOU GET THE ADVISED. NEED I UNDERSTAND THAT THAT. STRONG INSTITUTION TO BE ABLE TO THAT COMMITMENT- AB BUT THAT BUT YET THAT'S THAT WHAT. THAT'S WHAT WE NEED OUR CAMPUSES TO REALLY DO RIGHT AND IF THERE ARE ROADBLOCKS TO DOING THAT WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THOSE ARE I FIND INTERESTING- THE YOU KNOW THE COAL HEART STRATEGY WHERE ARE YOU WERE ALREADY SELECTING PRE SELECTING COURSES IF YOU SAY YOU WANT TO BE A MATH MAJOR OR HISTORY MAJOR. THE INSTITUTIONS IT'S SAYING WE'RE GOING TO DO IN A COLLECTION OF KIDS THAT ARE GOING TO HAVE THE SAME GOALS THAT HAVE AND WE'RE GONNA OUT IDENTIFIES COURSES THEY KEEP TRACK I THINK THAT'S A BIG MODEL AN EXAMPLE. OF WHERE I'VE GOT TO COME A POINT OF VIEW OF MAKING SURE THE CLASSES ARE AVAILABLE BUT THAT THAT THAT INSTITUTIONAL HUG ABOUT WE'RE GOING TO BE WITH YOU AND- ALONE- IS A VERY IMPRESSIVE- PATHWAY THAT I THINK I BUT IT SURE. AS WELL. BUT THE PRESSURE ON INSTITUTION TO MAKE THOSE CLASSES AVAILABLE IS A BIG DEAL AND I AM NOT WHEN I TALK TO STUDENTS- AND WE'VE BEEN ON A WHOLE BUNCH OF CAMPUSES IN THE LAST YEAR. DATE THEY'VE UNIVERSALLY TALK ABOUT THE AVAILABILITY CLASS I CAN GET MY CLASSES AND I KNOW SOMETIMES AND STUDENTS SAY THAT THEY JUST DON'T WANT TO GET UP EARLY AND I WANT TO GET ON THAT EIGHT AM CLASS I KNOW I REMEMBER. I REMEMBER I DID TAKE A FEW EIGHT AM CLASSES AND ABOUT SENATOR ALLEN HE SEES THE RIVER GET UP KIND OF LATE BUT SEVEN TWENTY. YOU TOOK A SEVEN TWENTY EIGHT YEAH. YEAH YOU HAD NO CHOICE ON A HIGH SCHOOL COURSE. BUT A SUB- AYE AYE BUT WE NEED YOU KNOW. WHAT LOOK LOOK AT THAT IT LOOK AT EASTBAY. AT A SITUATION WHERE THEY'VE ACTUALLY GONE BACKWARDS IN FIVE YEARS. AND THEY DON'T SEEM TO BE PROVIDING THE PATHWAY AT LEAST THROUGH THE PROMISE PROGRAM MAYBE THERE'S ALTERNATIVES THAT THEY PROVIDED ON THEIR CAMPUSES BUT THOSE ARE THOSE ARE HARDER NUMBERS TO KIND OF UNDERSTAND- AND WE'RE WE'RE IN THE PROBLEM SOLVING MODE WE WANT TO HELP EVERY STUDENT EVERY CAMPUS IT'S ALSO THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE IN THE STATE- WE WANT TO HELP YOU WE WOULD HAVE A MISSION. BUT SOMEBODY THIS IS THE WILL DURING TO NOT UNDERSTAND WHY THEY- YOU KNOW IT WHILE THE E. YOU'RE GIVING THEM SOME FREEDOM TO DO THINGS THEIR OWN WAY AND I APPRECIATE THAT. BUT BUT IT'S NOT HAPPENING AND- EAT IN SOME OF THESE CAMPUSES I THINK I TOLD YOU THE STORY- PUP MONA. WE SAT DOWN WITH THE STUDENTS AT POMONA. I ASKED HOW MANY OF THEM WERE AWARE OF A FOUR YEAR TRACK CALLED THE PROMISE PROGRAM CALLED FINISHING FOR WHATEVER YOU WANNA CALL IT. OF THOSE TWENTY FIVE STUDENT COUNCIL MEMBERS AROUND THAT IN THE ROOM. NOT A SINGLE PERSON IS THERE HAVE A THEY WERE EVEN A WHAT ARE. ABOUT FOUR YEAR PATHWAY THAT THEY COULD GET ON ON THAT CAMPUS. AND THAT'S NOT TO SAY THINGS ARE GOING PRETTY WELL AT THE MOMENT THEY ARE THERE SOME REAL PROGRESS POINTS MONA SO I DON'T WANT TO. THROW THEM UNDER THE BUS. BUT WE GO TO THE MINGUS HILLS SAME THING- AND SO THIS ISSUE OF AWARENESS IS A BIG DEAL YOU TALKED ABOUT THE WEBSITE YOU TALKED ABOUT THE COMMITMENT FROM THE CHASER WHICH WE APPRECIATE. TO MAKE SURE THAT THE AWAY. AT LEAST WITH. YOU KNOW SIGN IN PLACE IS A LITTLE BIT MORE PROMINENT BUT- WHAT CAN THE SYSTEM DO I KNOW YOU WRITE YOU WITH. YOU RECOGNIZE THE ECONOMY THE CAMPUSES YOU'RE THERE TO BE THERE. THERE IS YOUR IS THERE ASSISTANCE AND- BIRD THEIR GUIDANCE COUNSELOR PERSON IF YOU IF YOU WILL. BUT WHAT CAN WE DO MORE TO MAKE SURE THAT. WHILE THAT MAY FEEL THE PRESSURE OF WE GOT TO MAKE THE CLASSES AVAILABLE OF PEOPLE SIGN UP FOR THE FOR YOUR TRACK. THAT'S THEY NEED TO DO. REALLY IS WHAT THEY NEED TO. ALSO PETER IT'S A IT'S A GREAT. WHAT THOSE ARE GREAT EXAND I WILL BE THE FIRST TO ACKNOWLEDGE THIS SYSTEMATICALLY PROVIDING CRITICAL INFORMATION TO INCOMING STUDENTS IS A CHALLENGE AYE AYE I SAT DOWN WITH THE- A GROUP OF STUDENTS FOR DINNER- IT WHEN I WAS VISITING THE CAMPUS A FEW WEEKS AGO. AND ONE OF THE STUDENTS SAID TO ME HE- I THANK GOD I WAS ASKING ABOUT WERE IN TATIAN STUDENTS SAID TO ME WELL I DIDN'T GO TO ORIENTATION WHAT DO YOU MEETING GOING I DON'T KNOW ABOUT IT. SO IN MY MIND HOW DOES THE INCOMING STUDENTS NOT GET GOOD INFORMATION ABOUT SOMETHING AS CRITICAL AS ADVISING SO I KNOW THAT THAT HAPPENS NOT JUST PUT THIS PROGRAM THAT'S WHAT. OTHER AREAS WHERE STUDENTS ARE NOT RECEIVING CRITICAL INFORMATION. JUST ONE BIT FURTHER ON THIS. IS THAT A STUDENT SUCCESS SUMMIT ON ONE OF THE CAMPUSES AND THERE WAS THIS HUGE DEBATE ABOUT THE EFFECTIVENESS OF EMAIL. AND THERE WAS A SORT OF ONGOING JOKE ABOUT THE PERCENTAGE OF STUDENTS ACTUALLY READ EMAILS THAT COME FROM. THE INSTITUTION SO THERE WAS A REAL ALL CONVERSATION ABOUT ALTERNATIVE WAYS OF TRANSMITTING CRITICAL IMPORTANT INFORMATION TO STUDENTS. SO I THINK YOU KNOW THAT IS A BIG PART OF OUR STRATEGY YOU HEARD ME MENTION EARLIER. THAT THIS WILL NOW BECOME A FEATURE ON CAL STATE APPLY. I SAW THE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF APPLICANTS EACH YEAR THAT ARE GOING TO THAT WEBSITE- THE CALIFORNIA PROMISE WILL BE FEATURED THERE AND A TAB WITH INFORMATION AND AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THEM.TO FIND ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THEIR CAMPUS AND I THINK THAT WILL GO A LONG WAY. ARE THE OTHER IS THAT I THINK YOU CONTINUING TO PUSH US ON THIS ISSUE. HAS FOR SOME ACTION AS I MENTIONED THE CHANCELLOR'S NOW COMMUNICATING WITH CAMPUS PRESIDENT. THERE ARE A HANDFUL OF OTHER KERN COMMUNICATIONS THAT HAVE GONE TO OUR CAMPUS LEADERS ABOUT HOW TO MORE PROMINENTLY FEATURED THIS PROGRAM SO. ARE WE HAVE MADE A COMMITMENT TO THIS AND I EXPECT THAT YOU WILL SEE IMPROVEMENTS ACROSS THE BOARD WE GOT FOR. I STORY IN A LOT ANGELES TIMES A FEW DAYS AGO TOP. THE CAST LA WAS DOING WITH PARENTS BRING THEM AT THE RIGHT TIME THE SEMESTER. IN THERE I BELIEVE IT WAS THEIR FRESHMAN YEAR TO MAKE SURE THAT- THEY KNEW- WHAT WAS GOING ON SO THEY COULD CONNECT BETTER WITH THEIR STUDENTS AND TO MONITOR AND I THOUGHT THAT WAS A REALLY POSITIVE THING TO DO YOU KNOW AGAIN ANOTHER EXAMPLE. CAL LOS ANGELES IS THE LOWEST GRADUATION RATES IN THE STATE AND THEY ARE NOT ONE OF THE FEW CAMPUSES THAT ARE NOT PARTICIPATING IN EITHER THE TWO YEAR. OR THE FORTY PLEDGE PROGRAM AND I APPRECIATED THAT STILL THEIR CHOICE BUT IT'S OKAY IF IT'S CHOI IF THEY'RE MAKING PROGRESS. BUT IF NOT MAKING PROGRESS A SERIOUS MATTER THAT'S THAT'S NOT JUST THEIR FAILURE THAT'S OUR FAILURE TO AND I THINK WE ALL FEEL THAT. WE ARE YOUR PARTNERS AND- I WAS GLAD THAT SENATOR ROTTEN CENTER LABOR WERE HERE EARLIER BECAUSE- THEY SAID ON THE BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE AND THEY'VE HEARD FROM ME AND THEY WILL CONTINUE TO HEAR FROM ME. ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF INVESTING IN OUR- FOUR YEAR. GRADUATE PROGRAM OUR STUDENT SUCCESS PROGRAM THAT. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THE GOVERNOR- YOU KNOW DESERVES A LOT OF PRAISES BUDGET LAST YEAR WAS. ONE OF THE MOST GENEROUS FOR THE CSU THAT WE'VE HAD IN A LONG TIME AND- BUT UNFORTUNATELY WHAT'S BEEN PROPOSED IN JANUARY- REALLY HAS SOME SHORTCOMINGS TO IT. IT'S MY HOPE THAT WITH UNDER CENTER RAS. LEADERSHIP THE CENTER LEYVA SENATOR ALLEN. THAT WE CAN- AGAIN DO WHAT WE HAVE IN OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS IS IDENTIFY THESE ELEMENTS FOR STUDENT SUCCESS. WHETHER IT'S AN ACADEMIC ADVISING OR IF IT'S IN COUNSELING- WE'VE TALKED ABOUT BASIC NEEDS ANOTHER HEARINGS WE YOU YOU OFFER A STATE AND WE'VE TALKED ABOUT IT BEFORE. I DON'T WANT TO LOSE SIGHT OF I'M- OF. SHELL AND- FOOD AND OTHER ELEMENTS THAT GET IT INTO THE TO CLASS AND- MOTIVATED TO DO WELL. BUT I'M GONNA CONTINUE TO PUT FOR THE RESOURCE. HEY I CAN'T I AS A SAID AT THE START OF THE HEARING T. TAKE TAKE TO PROVIDE IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS ABOUT A LITTLE BIT LESS THAN 1% IMPROVEMENT IN THE C. AS HIS BUDGET AND GET A FORTY SEVEN PERCENT- IMPROVEMENT AND OUTCOME. THERE'S NOT A PROGRAM IN STATE GOVERNMENT THAT IS HAD THAT SUCCESS. THERE THERE ISN'T. WE HEAR A LOT OF TALK- WE'VE BOTH THE SAT ON BUDGET COMMITTEES IN THE PAST WHERE PEOPLE SAID IF YOU GIVE US SOME MORE MONEY. WE CAN DO BETTER WHATEVER IT IS AND WE DO A LOT OF GREAT HINGS IN STATE GOVERNMENT- AND THAT'S ALWAYS THE ARGUMENT. IT'S A GOOD INVESTMENT. AND I THINK THE FACTS THAT WE HAVE BEFORE US A CLEAR THIS IS NOT JUST TALK. THIS IS A REAL. REAL SHE- MOVING WHAT YOU SAY YOU. DO MOVING- AND THE RETURN TO THE- MESS AND I PLEDGE TO YOU MY CONTINUED EFFORTS TO TRY TO- INCREASE THE SUPPORT FOR THE PROGRAMS IN WHICH OF COMMENTS AND SPOKEN ABOUT TODAY- BEFORE I GO TO POWER PUBLIC HEARING PORTION CENTER ALLEN ANY QUESTIONS YOU HAVE BEFORE YEAH WELL THANK YOU FOR- JUSTIFICA QUESTIONS FIRST OF ALL I. I YOU NEED TO WE HAVE THE FIVE YEAR RATES. WE HAVE HEARD THE EQUIVALENT CHART FOR FIVE YEAR RAISES OPPOSED TO FOUR YEAR. FOR THIS. YEAH THAT SIX ZERO EIGHT YEAH ON THE NIGHT ARE ONLY FOR YOUR RIGHTS NOT THE SIX YEAR RATES SIX YOUR GRADUATION RATES YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT FOUR OR FIVE. YEAR WELL WE HAVE THERE IS THE OVERALL PROGRESS SO FIVE YEARS AGO THE FOUR YEAR GRADUATION RATE WAS NINETEEN PERCENT. AND NOW TO TWENTY EIGHT. SO THAT THAT'S THE ONLY. I GUESS I'M I'M ASKING ABOUT A FIVE YEAR GRADUATION RATE. WITH WITH PERCENT HOW HOW MUCH- HOW MANY WHAT ACTUALLY GRADUATED FIVE YES FIVE YEAH. DOCTOR MINOR MAY HAVE SOME INSIGHT I AM NOT REMEMBERING THE PERCENTAGE OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD BUT IT IS- SOUL. IF IT'S POSSIBLE WE WILL PROMISE ALL RIGHT THAT TO YOU RIGHT AWAY. AND THOSE NUMBERS HAVE GONE UP AS WELL. RIGHT WELL WE THINK YEAH YEAH. I'M I WANTED EASY THANK EVERY FOR ALL THE WORK THAT GOES BEHIND THIS DATA BOTH YOU KNOW. THE LEGISLATORS WHO PUSHED AND THAT. THE MINISTERS WHO HELPED TO MAKE IT HAPPEN I GUESS I'M. I LISTEN TO ALL THE THINGS THAT YOU GUYS HAVE DONE THE THINGS YOU'VE IMPLEMENTED TO HELP MAKE THESE. THESE DATA COME TO LIFE I SUPPOSE MY QUESTION FOR YOU IS. YOUR THEY WERE DEVOTED GOOD PEOPLE WORKING IN THE SYSTEM IN TWENTY FOURTEEN SOME OF YOU YOURSELVES OR IN SYSTEM AT THE TIME WHY WASN'T. WHOA WHAT WAS WHAT WAS THE DIFFERENCE I MEAN I UNDERSTAND I DON'T  DON'T NEED AT THE END I'M NOT ASKING FOR YOU TO KIND OF REPEAT ALL OF THE THINGS THAT YOU'VE DONE AND- TO GET TO WHERE WE ARE BUT- BUT WHAT WAS THE- THERE WAS JUST AS MUCH OF AN IMPERATIVE AND IS THERE IS NOW. WHAT WAS STOPPING THE SYSTEM FROM IMPLEMENTING THOSE KINDS OF. THOSE KINDS OF PROGRAMS BEFORE. I CAN ONLY SPEAK FOR OUR CAMPUSES I'M I'M I'VE ONLY BEEN ON OUR CAMPUS IN OUR SYSTEM PROUD OF WHAT ALL OF OUR OUR CAMPUS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO THE DIFFERENCE WAS A CONSCIOUS AND STARK CHANGE AND CULTURE AND THE WAY WE AND OUR COMMITMENT TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR STUDENTS HAVE WHAT THEY NEED- THERE WAS A THERE WAS A MEETING WE CALLED- I WAS VICE PROVOST OF THE TIME- WE CALLED IT SEVEN O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING. BEFORE YOU PUT A STOP SCHOOL WOULD ALLOW THE DEANS THE SAYS DEANS AND SAID- MAKE SURE YOU ADD SECTIONS WHEN OUR STUDENTS NEED THEM- AND THIS IS A DRAMATIC CHANGE AND BUT AS I SAID WE CHANGE WE OPTED ABOUT IT SO THAT OUR COLLEGES AVE NO REASON NOT TO ADD CLASSES BECAUSE WE'RE PAYING FOR THEM CENTRAL OUT OF ACADEMIC AFFAIRS. AND SO THEY COULDN'T COULDN'T HAVE THAT TRADE OFF OF I DON'T OFFER THIS SECTION I CAN USE THE MONEY FOR SOMETHING ELSE THAT'S JUST ONE EXAMPLE OF WE HAVE CHANGED THE WAY WE LOOK AT THINGS BUT WE ABOUT THINGS SOME OF WHAT. OUR FOR CULTURE. THE RESULT IS GREAT. WE HAD SO. FUNDING CUTS IN PEOPLE'S OF. RETREATED A SHELL AND IT TOOK. A DISRUPTION. TO BREAK US OUT OF THAT SHOW- AND ALLOW PEOPLE TO. TO DO IT EVERYBODY CAME TO THIS UNIVERSITY TO DO WHICH IS TO HELP OUR STUDENTS TO BE SUCCESSFUL NOW WE- NOW WE HAVE THE FREEDOM TO GO AHEAD AND DO THAT- BECAUSE THIS SUMMER MONEY. BECAUSE IT WELL IT WOULD BECAUSE WE'VE DEVOTED MONEY- WE'VE GOT WE'VE RECEIVED MORE MONEY- OTHER DIVISIONS WITHIN THE UNIVERSITY HAVE EITHER TAKEN CUTS ARE TAKEN SMALLER INCREASES- COMPARED ACADEMIC AFFAIRS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN- SUSTAIN. THE INSTITUTIONAL INSTRUCTION CAPACITY THAT WE'VE HAD WE'VE RECEIVED- MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS A ONE TIME MONEY. FROM THE UNIVERSITYOUT OF PRESERVES TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN CONTINUE- THAT PROGRESS AND SO IT WAS A CONSCIOUS. TO DO IT DIFFERENTLY AND THEN THE ENHANCE IT JUST SLIGHTLY MORE- AT BECAUSE I HAD A FRONT ROW SEAT TO THIS THAT- WHEN. WE WERE AS A TRUSTEE AT THE TIME. WHEN WE WERE- HIRING AND USE THE UNIVERSITY PRESIDENT I CHAIR THAT COMMITTEE SACRAMENTO STATE. AND WAS CLEAR THAT 8% FOUR YEAR GRADUATION RATE WAS NO GOOD AND THAT WE'RE GONNA GET NEW LEADERSHIP ON THE CAMPUS. WE NEED LEADERSHIP THAT WOULD BE NEEDED- TO DOING BETTER AND SO WHEN PRESIDENT NELSON WAS HIRED. HE KNEW THE FIVE TRUSTEES AT. THAT THIS. AND I THINK IF HE WAS HERE AND HE HAS TESTIFIED IN THE PAST TO EXPLAIN THAT. THAT HE'S MADE SOME BUDGET DECISIONS THAT DOESN'T HAVE A LOT OF BACKSTOPS. WHEN YOU USE RESERVES- EITHER YOU CAN'T GO AND SAY THEY'RE GOING TO REAPPEAR. IN THE NEXT YEAR. AND HE HAS MADE OTHER CHOICES OF REDUCING IN PLACES THAT CAN BE UNPOPULAR. ON CAMPUS BUT HE HAS OF THE EMBRACE THIS CULTURE CHANGE THAT YOU HAVE REFLECTED IN YOUR TESTIMONY TODAY. SENATOR ALLEN A FIVE IF I MAY I WANT TO JUST GIVE YOU A SYSTEM VIEW OF WHAT. SORT OF WHAT HAPPENED HERE. I THINK IN PART IN LARGE PART THIS IS AN EXTENSION OF WHAT. IN THIS HAPPENING NOW ACTUALLY IN IN TERMS OF- WHAT SOME OF TURNED. A NATIONAL WORK ON A HIGHER EDUCATION ACCOUNTABILITY MOVEMENT THERE TO THINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING SIMULTANEOUSLY. ONE IS THAT WE'RE EXPERIENCING A NATIONAL DEGREE SHORTAGE AND IN TERMS OF THE CHANGES IN THE WORK FORCE. AND THE PRODUCTIVITY OF INDIVIDUALS WITH A BACHELOR'S DEGREE A NATIONALLY WAS A PROBLEM. PREVIOUSLY I THINK DECADES BEFORE THE QUESTION WAS ABOUT WHO GETS TO PARTICIPATE IN COLLEGE. AND WHAT THAT MEANS FOR INDIVIDUALS IN TERMS OF WHO GETS THE GIRL WHO GETS TO GRADUATE. THAT CONVERSATION SHIFTED TO HOW MANY DEGREE HOLDERS DO WE NEED TO PRODUCE NATIONALLY OR FOR THE STATE TO MAKE. THE DEVIL BACK TO BECOME THAT TURN A VERY SURE I AND TO ASK HOW PRODUCTIVE WHERE THEY WITH PUBLIC DOLLARS IN SOME CASES FEDERAL DOLLARS. IN THE STUDENT- FINANCIAL A PROGRAM SO THAT THAT WAS ONE VARIABLE IS THE SORT OF NATIONAL RECOGNITION THAT WE NEED TO BE MORE PRODUCTIVE AND PRODUCE SOME DEGREE HOLDERS. ON THE SECOND WAS THE ABOLITION A COMMON GOAL AND THE REALIZATION THAT SOME CAMPUSES WERE WOEFULLY UNDER PERFORMING AND I THINK THERE WAS A LOT OF SURPRISE SHOCK AND ALL WHEN WE STARTED ABOUT WHAT FOR YOUR GRADUATION RATES WORK WITH THE-SECURE. SHARON WHAT THESE WERE BASED ON WHERE YOU GREW UP OR WHAT HIGH SCHOOL YOU ATTENDED. AND I THINK JUST BY SHEER AND SAW THAT FORCED THE CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT OUGHT TO BE WHAT'S A REASONABLE GOAL FOR OUR INSTITUTIONS IN TERMS OF GRADUATING A GREATER PERSON JUST IT RAW. AND ENOUGH AN OLD THING THING. A BLOOD DATA TO FRANCE. NO ARE CAN'T IS ONE OF TO BE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE LIST. YOU WERE PRODUCED A ARMS OF NICE TO XIN PERFECT INSIDE. OUR ABILITY TO JIM CAREFULLY WITH SOME DEGREE OF SENT TO STAR TO SHOW. AND A MORE TRANCE WAY HOW CAN WERE PERFORMING IN VARIOUS ASPECTS REALLY GOT A LOT OF PEOPLE'S ATTENTION. I MEAN IT WHAT WAS I MEAN SURELY THE DATA EXISTED BEFORE. THERE WILL BY I MAY TRY TO BETTER UNDERSTAND INSTITUTIONAL CULTURAL SHIPS I SUPPOSE WHEN I'M ASKING THESE QUESTIONS- THE SHOCK AND I DIDN'T EXIST BACK IN. TWO THOUSAND AND TEN YOUR PEOPLE SO STRESSED OUT ABOUT THE RECESSION WAS THAT THAT WAS GOING ON THE THAT. THERE'S LESS OF A DEGREE SHORTAGE PROBLEM BECAUSE IT RELIES JOBS AND THE MONEY WAS BEING CUT SO THAT WAS TAKING ALL THE ENERGY OF THE ROOM. I HAVE WHAT THEY THERE'S ONE OTHER. ELEMENT AND I THINK IT SPEAKS TO THE CULTURE SHIFT I THINK. AND MAYBE A GENERATION AGO THAT IF A STUDENT. ARRIVED ON A COLLEGE CAMPUS AND FOR WHATEVER REASON A YEAR LATER WAS BACK AT HOME WORKING AND AT THE MALL- THE PERCEPTION WAS SOMETHING WAS WRONG WITH THE YOU DIDN'T TRY HARD ENOUGH YOU WEREN'T MOTIVATED- AND I THINK. YOU KNOW INSTITUTIONS OF REALLY CHALLENGE THAT WE HAVE A SIGN TRADITIONALLY THE BLAME FOR ATTRITION OR DROP OUT TO THE INDIVIDUAL STUDENT THAT'S RIGHT TODAY WE ARE ASKING WHAT HAPPENS IN THIS ENVIRONMENT WHEN A YOUNG STUDENT ARRIVES OR YOUNG PERSON ARRIVES. THAT MAY CONTRIBUTE TO WHETHER OR NOT THERE STUDENT PERSIST TO WORDS A DEGREE OR THAT BACK HOME WORKING AT THE MALL A YEAR LATER AND THAT HAS BEEN A BIG PART OF THE CULTURAL SHIFT. IS THAT THE ASSIGNMENT AND THE ATTRIBUTION OF WHAT HAPPENS TO STUDENTS HAS COMPLETELY CHANGED IN HIGHER EDUCATION AND COMPLETELY CHANGED IN THE C. ISSUE. AND THE MEDIA ENHANCE THAT BECAUSE I THINK DOCTOR MINERS REALLY HIT ON THE HEAD. EVERY TIME- THIS CONVERSATION CAME UP AND IN 200-011-2000 TWELVE TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN THE ANSWER WAS WE HAVE DIFFERENT STUDENTS HERE AT THE CSU THAN IT YOU SEE. AND OUR STUDENTS CAN'T TAKE A LOAD THEY HAVE OTHER OBLIGATIONS AND THAT WAS THE NARRATIVE THAT'S WHY THE FOCUS IS ALWAYS ON THE SIX YEAR GRADUATION RATE WHICH AT THE TIME WAS UNDER FIFTY. BUT THAT'S WHAT THEY TAKE POINT TO AND SAY SEE WERE STILL DOING PRETTY WELL. YOU WILL WAS IT WAS THE STUDENTS NOT THE AND- WAS IN THE BARRIERS. AND THE SECOND PART OF THAT IS THAT. IT'S FROM A THIRTY THOUSAND FOOT LEVEL- FOR HIGHER EDUCATION IN CALIFORNIA THE FOCUS FOR DECADES BECAUSE I GO BACK TO THE SEVENTIES AND BEING INVOLVED IN THE CSU. THE FOCUS. DECADES WAS. LAST ACCESS AND QUALITY. THOSE ARE THE STANDARDS THAT WERE EVALUATED BY THE STUDENTS BY THE FACULTY BY THE LEADERSHIP. HOW MUCH TO TUITION WAS OR NOT HOW ACCESSIBLE- STUDENTS SCHOOL ADMISSIONS COULD BE AND THAT WAS WE KEEP IN THE QUALITY AT A HIGH LEVEL. AND THOSE WERE THE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT- THE METRICS FOR SUCCESS IT WASN'T ABOUT STUDENT COMPLETION AND THAT'S THE NEW THING. AND THERE WAS A VIEW THAT THAT STUDENT POLLUTION REALLY WAS AN INSTITUTIONAL OBLIGATION. AND THAT'S WHERE WE TALK ABOUT CULTURE. THAT'S HOW THINGS IN MY VIEW EDGE AT SHIFT CHANGE THIS DOCTOR MINOR HAS INDICATED. YEAH YEAH THE I MEAN FOR ME I GUESS THE QUESTION IS SO VERY MUCH GREAT PROGRESS I MEAN WHAT ONE QUESTION I SUPPOSE I HAVE IS- WHAT PERCENTAGE OF YOUR STUDENTS. SHOW UP ON CAN'T EXPECTING TO GRADUATE IN FOUR YEARS WHEN YOU KNOW. THE DAY THEY FIRST AND ROLL THIS ROUGHLY 84% SYSTEM ONE YEAH. SO THEY'RE STILL IT YOU KNOW WE CELEBRATE ENORMOUS SUCCESS AND WE YOU KNOW WE WERE ABLE TO GET. SACRAMENTO FROM NINE TO TWENTY BUT- THE GAP BETWEEN EIGHT THIRTY HIM TWENTY SONORA MISS AND- SO THEY'RE STILL. AND MAYBE THAT'S A REASONABLE EXPECTATION I DON'T KNOW I MEAN I YOU KNOW BUT- NO I MEAN WE HAVE A LOT OF WORKS THE YET TO DO- ON THAT FIRST LIST OUT WE WERE NEAR THE BOTTOM- WE WERE NOT PROUD TO BE. ON THERE- AND SO THERE WAS SOME TALK IN AWE. OF HOW WHAT ARE WE DOING- SELF REFLECTION. IN HOW WE'RE DOING THINGS- AND WE'VE MADE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES OF MORE AMERICAN WILL CONTAIN A MAY. AND I THINK YOU YOUR QUESTION UNDERSCORES WHAT IS MY BELIEF WHICH IS THAT. THE GOALS THAT THIS TEMAS STAT THE FORTY BY TWO TWENTY. OUR AND READ. I KNOW WE CAN A LOT MORE WITH THAT. THE FOR YOU GRAY. AVERAGES BETWEEN SEPT 80% CAMPUS TODAY. WHEN I SPOKE WITH PRESIDENT THAT APOLLO ON A RECENT THIS WAS WILL GO UP ABOUT THIS SHE SAYS WE'RE TO GET TO KNOW. SHE NOT SET THEY AND THEY ARE PER TO GET EVEN HIGHER AND I KNOW THAT ARE STUDENTS CSU CAN DO AS WELL. AND SO WHILE WE ARE MAKING ENORMOUS PROGRESS IN MANY CASES I KNOW THAT WE CAN DO A LOT BETTER NOT ONLY BECAUSE WE NEED IT FOR CALIFORNIA CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY BUT WE COULD WE KNOW THE TRAGEDY OF THE STUDENT IS DONE EVERYTHING RIGHT GOTTEN THE GRADES GOT ADMITTED TAKING THE LOANS AND THEN HAVE TO DROP OUT WITH NO DEGREE AND- THAT THAT'S A TRAP. THAT I HAD YOU KNOW WE DON'T LIKE TO TALK ABOUT IT BECAUSE IT'S UNCOMFORTABLE THAT'S PARTLY WHY IT'S NOT DISCUSS FOR IT THEN IN THE PAST BUT NOW IT'S BEEN AIRED OUT AND- AND WE'RE SEEING THE RESULTS. CAN SO I WHEN OPENING UP THE PUBLIC COMMENT IF SOMEONE IS HERE I WOULD LIKE TO SHARE THEIR THOUGHTS BEFORE WE CONCLUDE THE HEARING PLEASE COME ON UP TO THE MICROPHONE IN% AND OUT LET US KNOW ANYBODY HERE WANT TO HAVE ANYTHING TO SAY. OKAY I KNOW THAT THAT THIS SIZE THIS YEAR CHANCELLOR WHITE. IS COMPLETING HIS- INCREDIBLE SERVICE TO THE CSU. AND THERE'S A LOT TO PRAISE HIM FOR- AND THE AMAZING THINGS THAT THE CSU HAS DONE DURING THE TIME THAT HE HAS SERVED. AS OUR LEADER THERE- BUT I BELIEVE THAT THE PROGRESS THAT YOU'VE ELIMINATED TODAY DOCTOR MINOR WITH YOUR TESTIMONY CAMPUSES THAT THAT ARE HERE TODAY- REALLY ARE A PART OF HIS LEGACY THAT HE HAS PUT THE CSU AND THE CAMPUS IS ON AND AN INCREDIBLY- ASCENDING TRAJECTORY OF ACCOMPLISHMENT AND SUCCESS EVEN GREATER THAN HE HE AND I AND- MANY COULD HAVE EVER IMAGINED SO  WANT TO. SHARE MY PRAISE TO HIM AND FOR HIS LEADERSHIP IN THIS AREA OBVIOUSLY SO MANY OTHER PLACES IN WHICH SHE HAS DONE GREAT THINGS FOR THE CSU AND OUR STATE. THE THAT I WANT HE WILL OFFER AN AND TO FIND SHARING YOUR STORIES. PLEASE THANK YOU PRESIDENT'S FOR THEIR LEADERSHIP AND OUR PRAISE FOR THEIR GREAT. THE GREAT WORK THAT YOU'VE BEEN ABLE TO REPRESENT TODAY. THE DOCTOR MINOR THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONTINUING WORKING LEADERSHIP IN THIS AREA WE HAVE HAD LOTS OF CONVERSATIONS. I KNOW WE HAVE A LOT MORE TO AT TO BE HAD. BECAUSE WE'RE ALL EXCITED ABOUT THE GREAT WORK THAT YOU ARE DOING- AND WE KNOW IT CAN BE EVEN A EVEN GREATER AND WE WANT TO BE PARTNERS IN THAT. SO WITH THAT THANK YOU ALL FOR ATTENDING AND FOR LISTENING AND- THIS SENATE COMMITTEE ON STUDENT SUCCESS IS ADJOURNED.
