ON THOSE PRISONS ARE LOCATED DON'T IN AND JUST CERTAIN COMMUNITIES EACH ONE OF THOSE COMMUNITIES HAS AN IMPACT WITHOUT THAT CENSUS BUREAU ACCOUNT OF THEM AND THEIR LOCATION. IT MET IT KIND OF MESSES WITH THE FUNDING SOURCES OR OR IMPACTS THAT ARE CREATED BY THEIR EXISTENCE UNDER THAT RESIDENTIAL AREA OUR RESIDENTS AREA. NOW THOSE COMMUNITIES ARE GONNA BE SHORTED- MUCH NEEDED FUNDS. FOR THE EMERGENCY SERVICES THAT ARE PROVIDED TO HIM AND ALL THE HOST OF OTHER LOCALITY- I SERVICES ARE BEING PROVIDED. THIS IS GOING TO DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECT THEM HOW DO YOU ADDRESS THAT I SHORTFALL NOW FOR THOSE COMMUNITIES ARE THAT ARE GOING TO BE IMPACTED. YEAH RESPECT I THINK THAT ALL COMMUNITIES DESERVE TO BE ADEQUATELY RESOURCE TO THEIR FULL CAPACITY. I THINK PRISONS- ARTIFICIALLY INFLATE A LOCAL POPULATION BECAUSE THE RESEARCH SHOWS THAT MOST FOLKS RETURN HOME. AFTER THEIR TIME IN INCARCERATION. AND SO THIS IS A PROCESS THAT WAS RECOMMENDED TO THE CITIZENS REDISTRICTING COMMISSION THEY ACCEPTED THAT RECOMMENDATION AND DECIDED TO DO IT ON THEIR OWN DURING THE LAST REDISTRICTING PROCESS. THEY FOUND IT TO BE INCREDIBLY SUCCESSFUL AND IMPORTANT- AND TO KIND OF ADDRESS. AN EQUAL REPRESENTATION CONCERN WHEN IT COMES TO PRISON GERRYMANDERING YOU COULD ARGUE THAT THE HOME DISTRICTS OR PLACES OR CITIES MUNICIPALITIES WHERE FOLKS. THIS BOOK TO THE COP FROM WARM CARS RATED ARE ALSO SHORT. POTENTIALLY SOME OF THOSE RESOURCES BECAUSE THEY DON'T- THAT THEY'RE NOT COUNTED IN THAT SAME WAY BECAUSE OF OUR PRISONS ARE LOCATED THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND SO. ON TO ME THIS IS A- A GOOD GOVERNANCE BILL- IN DRAWING FAIR LINE FOR REPRESENTATION- AND IT COMES OUT OF. RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE COMMISSION FROM THE WORK THAT THEY'VE DONE THIS LAST YEAR- THERE WERE NO CHALLENGES IT TO IT THIS LAST PROCESS AND- I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR SOME SUPPORT BUT WE CAN KEEP WORKING ON IT. THROUGH THE PROCESS IN TERMS OF ADDRESSING ANY ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES- BUT IT IS IT IS A FORM OF GERRYMANDERING AND I THINK WE SHOULD ADDRESS. I AND WE'RE IN AGREEMENT ON ON SEVERAL OF YOUR POINTS THERE I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT THOSE COMMUNITIES ARE IMPACTED IT'S NOT JUST THROUGHOUT MY DISTRICT IT'S A NUMBER OF. US THAT HAVE PRESENCE IN OUR DISTRICT AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE NOT IMPACTED THROUGH THESE ACTIONS OF YOUR WILLINGNESS TO WORK ON THAT WE APPRECIATE I WOULD LOVE TO TALK ABOUT WE CAN RESOURCES CAN. THANK YOU. OCTOBER YOUR ARM IT'S NOT CLEAR TO ME THAT CHANGING THE WAY. DISTRICTS ARE ALLOCATED NUMBERS OF PEOPLE. WOULD AFFECT FUNDING FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. ON THE CENSUS NUMBERS ARE STILL THE CENSUS NUMBERS SO THAT'S ACTUALLY GREAT POINT. YEAH SO I WOULD THINK THAT THESE COMMUNITIES SHOULDN'T. ARE SUFFER FROM THE CONCERNS THAT- THE VICE CHAIR HAS I THINK THEY WOULD CONTINUE TO GET. RESOURCE THE SAME WAY. I WOULD THINK AND I APPRECIATE THAT POINTS TO WORK IN AND I BELIEVE YOU ARE CORRECT RIGHT LESS ABOUT REPRESENTATION IN THE POLITICAL PROCESS CERTAINLY NOT A REVIEW BEING COUNTED FOR THE SENSES BUT I THINK WE SHOULD HAVE THAT CONVERSATION FEDERAL LEVEL TO. WELL- I'LL JUST SAY THE TWO OF YOU CAN WORK IT OUT. I SUSPECT WE WILL WE WILL. OKAY WE'LL TAKE THAT AS A CLOSE TO YOUR BILL BILL IS OUT ON A B. ROLL CALL.
