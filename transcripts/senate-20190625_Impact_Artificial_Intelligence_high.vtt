ANSWERING.

00:10:10.176 --> 00:10:11.410
BUT I ALSO.

00:10:11.477 --> 00:10:12.845
WANT TO POINT OUT.

00:10:12.912 --> 00:10:13.980
HOW?

00:10:14.046 --> 00:10:16.716
PRESENT ISSUES ON A. I. R..

00:10:16.782 --> 00:10:17.283
SO.

00:10:17.350 --> 00:10:19.452
THIS MORNING I WAS READING THE

00:10:19.518 --> 00:10:20.453
WALL STREET JOURNAL.

00:10:20.519 --> 00:10:22.054
AND SAW ONE OF THE ARTICLES IS

00:10:22.121 --> 00:10:24.657
APPRENTICED PLANS FACE RETOOLING.

00:10:24.724 --> 00:10:27.093
SO THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION HAS --

00:10:27.159 --> 00:10:29.929
PROPOSED CHANGES TO

00:10:29.996 --> 00:10:31.664
APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS.

00:10:31.731 --> 00:10:32.865
THE SENSUALLY REMOVING

PROGRAMS FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF

BUSINESS AND LABOR UNIONS

00:10:42.074 --> 00:10:42.308
[inaudible]

00:10:42.375 --> 00:10:43.642
SO.

00:10:43.709 --> 00:10:46.645
UNDERSTANDING THE TRENDS AND

00:10:46.712 --> 00:10:47.847
APPLYING A I'D.

00:10:47.913 --> 00:10:49.081
PARTICULARLY IN THE FACE OF

00:10:49.148 --> 00:10:50.182
THESE KINDS OF CHANGES WOULD BE

00:10:50.249 --> 00:10:52.184
VERY IMPORTANT TO WORKERS IN

00:10:52.251 --> 00:10:53.886
CALIFORNIA.

00:10:53.953 --> 00:10:55.187
AND IN ADDITION TO THAT THERE

00:10:55.254 --> 00:10:56.655
WAS A ON THAT SAME PAGE THE

00:10:56.722 --> 00:10:58.157
STORY THE TRUMP ADVISORS CALL

00:10:58.224 --> 00:11:00.359
JOB TRAINING EFFORTS IN AFFECTED.

00:11:00.426 --> 00:11:02.328
SO YOU CAN'T MANAGE WHAT YOU

00:11:02.395 --> 00:11:04.597
CAN'T MEASURE. TO ONE OF THE

00:11:04.663 --> 00:11:07.099
USES OF A AYE IS TO EVALUATE THE

00:11:07.166 --> 00:11:08.467
DIRECTION THAT WE ARE TRAVELING

00:11:08.534 --> 00:11:10.036
IN TERMS OF EMPLOYMENT AS WELL

00:11:10.102 --> 00:11:11.070
AS OTHER AREAS.

00:11:11.137 --> 00:11:12.705
AND THEN COME UP WITH METRICS

00:11:12.772 --> 00:11:14.273
AND STANDARDS SO THAT WE CAN

00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:15.975
BETTER PREDICT WHERE WE THINK

00:11:16.042 --> 00:11:17.910
JOBS WILL BE IN THE FUTURE AND

00:11:17.977 --> 00:11:19.211
HOW TO TRAIN.

00:11:19.278 --> 00:11:22.214
A DIFFERENT SORT OF WORK FORCE.

00:11:22.281 --> 00:11:23.682
WE HAD TESTIMONY WILL HOOVER

00:11:23.749 --> 00:11:24.917
COMMISSION HAD TESTIMONY JUST

00:11:24.984 --> 00:11:25.918
LAST WEEK.

00:11:25.985 --> 00:11:27.653
FROM THE CHANCELLOR OF COMMUNITY

00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:30.923
COLLEGES -- EXPLAINED TO US THAT

00:11:30.990 --> 00:11:33.325
THE OLD NOTION OF A HIGH SCHOOL

00:11:33.392 --> 00:11:35.628
DIPLOMA WHICH USED TO BE.

00:11:35.694 --> 00:11:36.962
THE PLACE WHERE YOU STARTED.

00:11:37.029 --> 00:11:38.164
ESSENTIALLY NOT THAT SIGNIFICANT

00:11:38.230 --> 00:11:39.131
ANYMORE.

00:11:39.198 --> 00:11:40.733
AND THAT WHAT MATTERS MORE OUR

00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:42.568
CERTIFICATIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE

00:11:42.635 --> 00:11:43.736
THOUGHT AND I DID WHEN HE FIRST

00:11:43.803 --> 00:11:45.204
BROACH THE SUBJECT BUT IT WOULD

00:11:45.271 --> 00:11:46.372
BE THE COLLEGE.

00:11:46.439 --> 00:11:48.007
EDUCATION OF COURSE THAT'S

00:11:48.074 --> 00:11:48.641
IMPORTANT FOR CERTAIN KINDS OF

00:11:48.707 --> 00:11:49.742
JOBS.

00:11:49.809 --> 00:11:51.410
BUT WHAT HE POINTED OUT IS IT

00:11:51.477 --> 00:11:52.845
MANY MANY EMPLOYMENT

00:11:52.912 --> 00:11:54.947
OPPORTUNITIES LOOK MORE TOWARDS

00:11:55.014 --> 00:11:57.083
CERTIFICATION IN SPECIFIC FIELDS

00:11:57.149 --> 00:12:00.152
OF WORK THAN WE HAVE IN THE PAST

00:12:00.219 --> 00:12:00.653
AND HE EXPECTS THAT WILL

00:12:00.719 --> 00:12:02.455
CONTINUE TO GROW.

00:12:02.521 --> 00:12:03.989
IN THINKING ABOUT A I ALSO IN

00:12:04.056 --> 00:12:06.325
THE WALL STREET JOURNAL.

00:12:06.392 --> 00:12:07.993
WAS ANOTHER ARTICLE.

00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:10.563
CALLED CRADLES THE PEWS AND

00:12:10.629 --> 00:12:12.631
SHIFTING POLITICS.

00:12:12.698 --> 00:12:13.566
SO.

00:12:13.632 --> 00:12:14.567
THE THRUST OF THIS ARTICLE WAS

00:12:14.633 --> 00:12:15.201
THAT.

00:12:15.267 --> 00:12:16.001
THE BIRTH RATE IN AMERICA IS

00:12:16.068 --> 00:12:18.437
DECLINING.

00:12:18.504 --> 00:12:20.039
SO THE IMMEDIATE IMPLICATIONS

00:12:20.106 --> 00:12:21.874
ACTUALLY MAYBE NOT IMMEDIATE BUT

00:12:21.941 --> 00:12:23.375
THE IMPLICATIONS WILL BE FEWER

00:12:23.442 --> 00:12:25.377
WORKERS THAT WILL CONTRIBUTE TO

00:12:25.444 --> 00:12:27.480
THE SOCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM.

00:12:27.546 --> 00:12:28.080
AND OTHER FORMS OF RETIREMENT

00:12:28.147 --> 00:12:29.248
PLANS.

00:12:29.315 --> 00:12:30.616
IT ALSO SEEMS TO ME THAT WE

00:12:30.683 --> 00:12:32.084
OUGHT TO BE LOOKING TO

00:12:32.151 --> 00:12:33.352
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE. TO GIVE

00:12:33.419 --> 00:12:34.820
US SOME IDEA ABOUT THE

00:12:34.887 --> 00:12:37.356
CHARACTERISTICS OF THIS NEW

00:12:37.423 --> 00:12:38.791
SMALLER POPULATION.

00:12:38.858 --> 00:12:40.993
AND IN FACT PERHAPS WHAT WE SEE

00:12:41.060 --> 00:12:42.795
AS INCREASE PRODUCTIVITY THROUGH

00:12:42.862 --> 00:12:44.864
THE APPLICATION OF A AYE MAYBE

00:12:44.930 --> 00:12:47.933
ONE ANSWER TO HOW IT IS WE DEAL

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:49.935
WITH A UP OFA POPULATION THAT

00:12:50.002 --> 00:12:51.804
DOESN'T GROW IN THE SAME RATE AS

00:12:51.871 --> 00:12:53.038
IT DID IN THE PAST.

00:12:53.105 --> 00:12:54.607
THE OTHER ASPECT OF THE ARTICLE

00:12:54.673 --> 00:12:57.443
HAD TO DO WITH USE -- AND THE

00:12:57.510 --> 00:13:00.412
FACT THAT FEWER AND FEWER PEOPLE

00:13:00.479 --> 00:13:02.081
IDENTIFY AS REGULARLY ATTENDING

00:13:02.148 --> 00:13:03.682
CHURCH.

00:13:03.749 --> 00:13:04.483
WELL WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO

00:13:04.550 --> 00:13:06.852
WITH ANYTHING WELL I SUSPECT.

00:13:06.919 --> 00:13:08.120
THAT THE APPLICATION TODAY I

00:13:08.187 --> 00:13:10.289
WILL GIVE US SOME INSIGHT INTO

00:13:10.356 --> 00:13:11.724
WHERE DO PEOPLE.

00:13:11.790 --> 00:13:14.260
GO TO SEEK AFFIRMATION OF THE

00:13:14.326 --> 00:13:16.462
DECISIONS THAT THEY MAKE IN OUR

00:13:16.529 --> 00:13:17.863
LIVES THE FAITH COMMUNITY.

00:13:17.930 --> 00:13:19.865
HISTORICALLY PLAYS A ROLE IN

00:13:19.932 --> 00:13:22.001
PROVIDING COMFORT IN DIRECTION

00:13:22.067 --> 00:13:23.636
AND GUIDANCE IF THERE ARE FEWER

00:13:23.702 --> 00:13:26.138
PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING TO ORGANIZE

00:13:26.205 --> 00:13:27.039
CHURCHES.

00:13:27.106 --> 00:13:28.874
WHERE IN FACT WILL THEY GAIN

00:13:28.941 --> 00:13:30.176
THEIR INSPIRATION?

00:13:30.242 --> 00:13:31.677
WHO WILL THEY LOOK TO FOR

00:13:31.744 --> 00:13:33.812
DIRECTION AND AND FOR GUIDANCE

00:13:33.879 --> 00:13:36.348

LIVES?

00:13:38.184 --> 00:13:39.351
I'M NOT SURE THAT WE WANT THEM.

00:13:39.418 --> 00:13:40.853
NECESSARILY GOING ONLINE.

00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:42.788

00:13:43.656 --> 00:13:44.256
IN THE WORLD.

00:13:44.323 --> 00:13:45.191
BUT IT DOES RAISE SOME ISSUES

00:13:45.257 --> 00:13:50.462

00:14:30.936 --> 00:14:31.937
KNOWLEDGE AT THIS POINT THAT

00:14:32.004 --> 00:14:33.606
WERE A BIT BEHIND THE EIGHT BALL.

00:14:33.672 --> 00:14:35.307
IN SO WITH WITH THAT IN MIND.

00:14:35.374 --> 00:14:37.743
OF MY QUESTION TO YOU IS.

00:14:37.810 --> 00:14:39.078
I SEE IN THE RECOMMENDATIONS A

00:14:39.144 --> 00:14:41.880
LITTLE HOOVER COMMISSION -- OF

00:14:41.947 --> 00:14:44.116
CREATING LEADERSHIP POSTS.

00:14:44.183 --> 00:14:45.684
ARE OR ENHANCING EXISTING

00:14:45.751 --> 00:14:47.519
LEADERSHIP POSE FOR THOSE WHO

00:14:47.586 --> 00:14:50.122
COULD SERVE AS A INTERFACES

00:14:50.189 --> 00:14:52.091
WITHIN THE A. I. TOPICS IN A

00:14:52.157 --> 00:14:56.262
GIVEN -- WE SEE WHAT HAPPENS

00:14:56.328 --> 00:14:59.198
WITH WILE AWAY AND HOW.

00:14:59.265 --> 00:15:00.332
THIS IS MORE OF A NATIONAL ISSUE

00:15:00.399 --> 00:15:02.301
BUT I THINK IT BEARS ON SILICON

00:15:02.368 --> 00:15:03.902
VALLEY IN OUR TECH SECTOR IS

00:15:03.969 --> 00:15:06.105
THAT -- WE RELY SO HEAVILY ON

00:15:06.171 --> 00:15:08.707
SUPPLY CHAIN IN INFORMATION --

00:15:08.774 --> 00:15:10.409
ASSETS FROM ELSEWHERE IN THE

00:15:10.476 --> 00:15:11.944
WORLD.

00:15:12.011 --> 00:15:13.879
AND WE DON'T HAVE -- ANY REAL

00:15:13.946 --> 00:15:16.682
DOMESTIC PLAYERS THAT ARE -- IT

00:15:16.749 --> 00:15:18.517
ADVANCING THE INFRASTRUCTURE AT

00:15:18.584 --> 00:15:20.419
A RATE THAT WE NEED.

00:15:20.486 --> 00:15:21.720
MY QUESTION TO YOU IS THIS IS.

00:15:21.787 --> 00:15:22.788
LITTLE HOOVER COMMISSION'S

00:15:22.855 --> 00:15:24.890
RECOMMENDATION INVOLVES THE

00:15:24.957 --> 00:15:26.692
GOVERNOR AND THE LEGISLATURE MY

00:15:26.759 --> 00:15:28.794
EXPERIENCE LEGISLATURE IS A

00:15:28.861 --> 00:15:31.130
WONDERFUL PART OF THE PROCESS.

00:15:31.196 --> 00:15:33.399
BUT THE SPEED AT WHICH WE NEED

00:15:33.465 --> 00:15:34.733
TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES.

00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:37.836
I CANNOT IMAGINE BEING ANYTHING

00:15:37.903 --> 00:15:38.404
OTHER THAN AT THE EXECUTIVE

00:15:38.470 --> 00:15:39.538
LEVEL.

00:15:39.605 --> 00:15:41.707
IN YOUR RECOMMENDATION OR IN

00:15:41.774 --> 00:15:44.276
YOUR OPINION DO YOU HAVE.

00:15:44.343 --> 00:15:45.477
A STRONG RECOMMENDATION.

00:15:45.544 --> 00:15:48.180
THAT THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE CAN

00:15:48.247 --> 00:15:49.081
TAKE.

00:15:49.148 --> 00:15:52.584
ARE A COHERENT LEAD.

00:15:52.651 --> 00:15:54.053
EN ADVANCING.

00:15:54.119 --> 00:15:56.522
THE TECH RELATED TOPICS AT THE

00:15:56.588 --> 00:15:58.557
STATE LEVEL EVEN THOUGH THEY

00:15:58.624 --> 00:16:00.159
WOULD NORMALLY BE RESERVED --

00:16:00.225 --> 00:16:01.960
FOR NATIONAL AND FEDERAL

00:16:02.027 --> 00:16:04.596
JURISDICTION GIVEN THE OPINIONS

00:16:04.663 --> 00:16:06.031
ON HOW GOVERNOR NEWSOME CAN.

00:16:06.098 --> 00:16:08.400
MOVE OUR SECTOR IN THAT RIGHT

00:16:08.467 --> 00:16:09.535
DIRECTION.

00:16:09.601 --> 00:16:11.570
WELL I I THINK WHAT WE SEEN

00:16:11.637 --> 00:16:14.173
FIRST OF ALL.

00:16:14.239 --> 00:16:15.708
DEPENDING ON WHO YOU ASK YOU THE

00:16:15.774 --> 00:16:16.275
FOR THE FOR THE SIX LARGEST

00:16:16.342 --> 00:16:17.976
ECONOMY IN THE WORLD.

00:16:18.043 --> 00:16:19.278
SO WE ARE.

00:16:19.345 --> 00:16:20.913
HAVE SIGNIFICANT ECONOMIC

00:16:20.979 --> 00:16:22.247
LEVERAGE OVER WHAT HAPPENS

00:16:22.314 --> 00:16:23.882
AROUND THE WORLD IN THE EXAMPLE

00:16:23.949 --> 00:16:25.384
THAT WE SET FOR OTHERS WILL BE

00:16:25.451 --> 00:16:27.186
FALL USUALLY. ONE OF THE THINGS

00:16:27.252 --> 00:16:28.921
I REMEMBER AS OF CALIFORNIA IS

00:16:28.987 --> 00:16:30.255
DOING AND OTHER STATES WILL

00:16:30.322 --> 00:16:32.624
PROBABLY PURSUE PURSUE THE SAME.

00:16:32.691 --> 00:16:33.392
AVENUE.

00:16:33.459 --> 00:16:35.627
AND I I AGREE WITH YOU THAT

00:16:35.694 --> 00:16:38.130
LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE AND SO

00:16:38.197 --> 00:16:39.865
MANY OTHER START FROM THE TOP I

00:16:39.932 --> 00:16:41.633
REMEMBER HAVING A CONVERSATION

00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:43.268
SOMETIME BACK.

00:16:43.335 --> 00:16:44.970
WITH SOMEBODY ABOUT WANTING TO

00:16:45.037 --> 00:16:46.338
CHANGE OF POLICY.

00:16:46.405 --> 00:16:48.407
IN AN AGENCY AND THE ANSWER THAT

00:16:48.474 --> 00:16:50.843
I WAS GIVEN WAS AS SOON AS IT

00:16:50.909 --> 00:16:52.578
BECOMES POLICY WILL DO IT.

00:16:52.644 --> 00:16:54.480
SO WHEN THE GOVERNOR DECIDES

00:16:54.546 --> 00:16:56.582
THAT.

00:16:56.648 --> 00:16:59.752
HE OR MAYBE SOMEDAY SHE WANTS TO

00:16:59.818 --> 00:17:00.853
PURSUE A PARTICULAR AVENUE.

00:17:00.919 --> 00:17:03.222
PEOPLE JUST LINE UP.

00:17:03.288 --> 00:17:04.022
AND THAT'S THE WAY IT WILL

00:17:04.089 --> 00:17:05.491
HAPPEN AND THAT'S WHY IT'S

00:17:05.557 --> 00:17:07.426
IMPORTANT WITH LEGISLATIVE

00:17:07.493 --> 00:17:08.527
EFFORTS WORKING IN CONJUNCTION

00:17:08.594 --> 00:17:11.029
WITH THE GOVERNOR. TO SEE WHAT

00:17:11.096 --> 00:17:12.698
IT IS THAT NEEDS TO BE PUT IN

00:17:12.765 --> 00:17:14.366
PLACE THAT THIS GOVERNOR CAN

00:17:14.433 --> 00:17:16.335
SUPPORT IN ORDER FOR IT TO

00:17:16.402 --> 00:17:18.437
BECOME POLICY.

00:17:18.504 --> 00:17:23.275
AND NOT JUST A CONVERSATION --

00:17:23.342 --> 00:17:26.712
MAN MAN. ONE SO WE'VE HEARD

00:17:26.779 --> 00:17:28.647
ABOUT SMART CITIES AND WE'VE

00:17:28.714 --> 00:17:31.550
HEARD ABOUT -- CHINA'S

00:17:31.617 --> 00:17:34.286
PREEMINENCE IN THIS IN THIS THIS

00:17:34.353 --> 00:17:36.288
FIELD IN THIS DEVELOPING FIELD --

00:17:36.355 --> 00:17:37.389
WE SIT.

00:17:37.456 --> 00:17:40.325
CHAIRMAN I SAID ON JUDICIARY AND

00:17:40.392 --> 00:17:41.660
WE DEAL HEAVILY AND PRIVACY.

00:17:41.727 --> 00:17:43.662
ARE RELATED ISSUES SPECIALLY

00:17:43.729 --> 00:17:45.697
DURING THIS SESSION.

00:17:45.764 --> 00:17:47.065
DO YOU THINK THAT.

00:17:47.132 --> 00:17:49.968
AS WE TRIED -- RATING BACK THE

00:17:50.035 --> 00:17:53.038
FLOW OF INFORMATION FROM THOSE

00:17:53.105 --> 00:17:56.542
WHO GATHERED AND BROKER IT.

00:17:56.608 --> 00:17:59.278
THAT THAT WILL PUT HARD.

00:17:59.344 --> 00:18:01.380
TACK OPERATIVES AT A

00:18:01.447 --> 00:18:02.981
DISADVANTAGE COMPARED TO THE

00:18:03.048 --> 00:18:04.516
SHEER VOLUME.

00:18:04.583 --> 00:18:06.285
THAT CHINA HAS TO BRING INTO ITS

00:18:06.351 --> 00:18:07.853
SYSTEM IN LEARNING AND PREDICT

00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:09.488
HUMAN BEHAVIOR.

00:18:09.555 --> 00:18:11.323
YEAH WELL YOU KNOW ONE OF THE

00:18:11.390 --> 00:18:12.758
ADVANTAGES OF CHINA HAS IS YOU

00:18:12.825 --> 00:18:13.225
KNOW.

00:18:13.292 --> 00:18:18.063
THEY'VE GOT A PRESIDENT FOR LIFE.

00:18:18.130 --> 00:18:21.433
IT IS TERRIBLY CONVENIENT WELL.

00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:25.170
JUST JUST.

00:18:25.237 --> 00:18:26.238
IF YOU'RE.

00:18:26.305 --> 00:18:27.072
YOU SHOULD SEE IT IF WE'RE

00:18:27.139 --> 00:18:28.140
TALKING ABOUT THE GOVERNOR

00:18:28.207 --> 00:18:28.807
CALIFORNIA DECIDING.

00:18:28.874 --> 00:18:29.575
THAT HE WANTS SOMETHING TO BE

00:18:29.641 --> 00:18:31.009
POLICY THAN THINGS LINE UP.

00:18:31.076 --> 00:18:32.744
IMAGINE THAT ON STEROIDS IN

00:18:32.811 --> 00:18:35.080
CHINA BECAUSE QUITE FRANKLY MANY

00:18:35.147 --> 00:18:36.682
MANY YEARS AGO THEY RECOGNIZED.

00:18:36.748 --> 00:18:38.917
THAT THEY WERE GOING TO HAVE TO

00:18:38.984 --> 00:18:40.486
COMPETE IN A DIFFERENT WAY.

00:18:40.552 --> 00:18:42.221
ARM AND EMBRACED ARTIFICIAL

00:18:42.287 --> 00:18:43.889
INTELLIGENCE -- AND COMPUTER

00:18:43.956 --> 00:18:45.524
SCIENCES AND ALL THE REST I'M

00:18:45.591 --> 00:18:47.059
REMINDED.

00:18:47.125 --> 00:18:49.828
OF OF A STORY.

00:18:49.895 --> 00:18:51.497
THERE WAS A A CHINESE AVERELL.

00:18:51.563 --> 00:18:54.099
WHO -- EXPLORED THE WORLD I MEAN

00:18:54.166 --> 00:18:55.834
INCREDIBLE NAVY'S LARGER THAN

00:18:55.901 --> 00:18:57.936
ANY NAVIES THAT EVER EXISTED AT

00:18:58.003 --> 00:19:00.839
THAT TIME -- BUT THEN LEADERSHIP

00:19:00.906 --> 00:19:01.607
CHANGE IN CHINA.

00:19:01.673 --> 00:19:05.410
AND THAT DYNASTY DESTROYED THE

00:19:05.477 --> 00:19:07.579
SHIP'S BURNT THE COAST -- AND

00:19:07.646 --> 00:19:08.580
PROHIBIT ANYONE FROM BUILDING

00:19:08.647 --> 00:19:10.249
SHIPS LARGER THAN A PARTICULAR

00:19:10.315 --> 00:19:11.149
SIZE.

00:19:11.216 --> 00:19:13.352
BECAUSE CHINA DECIDED THEN THAT

00:19:13.418 --> 00:19:14.753
THEY WERE GOING TO TURN IN WORK.

00:19:14.820 --> 00:19:15.420
THAT LASTED FOR HOWEVER LONG IT

00:19:15.487 --> 00:19:16.255
LASTED.

00:19:16.321 --> 00:19:18.257
BUT IT'S NOT THE CASE ANYMORE

00:19:18.323 --> 00:19:19.625
AND HAS BEEN FOR A LONG TIME.

00:19:19.691 --> 00:19:22.427
AND SO YOU SEE CHINA ENGAGED IN

00:19:22.494 --> 00:19:25.264
PLACES LIKE AFRICA -- MAKING

00:19:25.330 --> 00:19:28.100
SIGNIFICANT.

00:19:28.166 --> 00:19:31.203
INVESTMENTS IN INFRASTRUCTURE --

00:19:31.270 --> 00:19:33.805
WHERE IN FACT THE COLLATERAL IS

00:19:33.872 --> 00:19:35.340
THE INFRASTRUCTURE ITSELF SO

00:19:35.407 --> 00:19:37.876
THAT IF THE COUNTRY UNABLE TO

00:19:37.943 --> 00:19:38.510
MAKE ITS PAYMENT GUESS WHAT THEY

00:19:38.577 --> 00:19:39.344
GET A PORT?

00:19:39.411 --> 00:19:41.880
SO THEY'RE VERY FORWARD LOOKING

00:19:41.947 --> 00:19:43.582
IF IF AMERICA.

00:19:43.649 --> 00:19:45.183
IS GO HAS ANY HOPE OF CATCHING

00:19:45.250 --> 00:19:46.151
UP.

00:19:46.218 --> 00:19:48.420
IT IS GOING TO HAVE TO BE MUCH

00:19:48.487 --> 00:19:49.288
MORE ASSERTIVE.

00:19:49.354 --> 00:19:51.757
ABOUT PURSUING A AYE HOWEVER.

00:19:51.823 --> 00:19:52.824
WHAT MAKES WHAT WE DO HERE IN

00:19:52.891 --> 00:19:54.493
THIS COUNTRY?

00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:57.129
A LITTLE DIFFERENT IS WE DO HAVE

00:19:57.195 --> 00:19:59.798
RESPECT FOR IDEAS OF PRIVACY.

00:19:59.865 --> 00:20:01.900
AND SO WHAT WE HEARD DURING OUR

00:20:01.967 --> 00:20:03.068
CONVERSATIONS WITH STAKEHOLDERS

00:20:03.135 --> 00:20:04.336
OF OUT.

00:20:04.403 --> 00:20:09.207
THE PURSUIT OF A I WE NEED TO BE

00:20:09.274 --> 00:20:10.742
SENSITIVE TO THE ROLE OF

00:20:10.809 --> 00:20:12.110
REGULATION.

00:20:12.177 --> 00:20:13.579
IN THROTTLING BACK INNOVATION

00:20:13.645 --> 00:20:13.879
[inaudible]

00:20:13.946 --> 00:20:15.113
SO THAT [inaudible]

00:20:15.180 --> 00:20:16.982
IF.

00:20:17.049 --> 00:20:19.351
WE REACT IN A WAY THAT.

00:20:19.418 --> 00:20:21.386
IS REFLECTIVE OF ANXIETY AND

00:20:21.453 --> 00:20:24.590
FEAR FOR THE TECHNOLOGY.

00:20:24.656 --> 00:20:26.491
THEN WE COULD END UP IN A

00:20:26.558 --> 00:20:27.125
SITUATION THAT YOU'RE TALKING

00:20:27.192 --> 00:20:28.293
ABOUT WHERE THERE'S A

00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:31.330
DISINCENTIVE. TO PURSUE THAT

00:20:31.396 --> 00:20:32.798
WHICH WE NEED.

00:20:32.864 --> 00:20:34.499
WHICH IS A PART OF WHY SOME A

00:20:34.566 --> 00:20:36.868
RECOMMENDATION IN THE REPORT IS

00:20:36.935 --> 00:20:38.570
AT THE STATE NEEDS TO ACTIVELY.

00:20:38.637 --> 00:20:39.905
AND AGGRESSIVELY ENGAGE IN A

00:20:39.972 --> 00:20:41.073
PUBLIC EDUCATION AND OUTREACH

00:20:41.139 --> 00:20:44.109
PROGRAM. TO ENSURE THAT PEOPLE

00:20:44.176 --> 00:20:46.878
UNDERSTAND A I AND ITS BENEFITS

00:20:46.945 --> 00:20:48.046
SO THAT WE UNDERSTOOD BECAUSE I

00:20:48.113 --> 00:20:49.615
THINK THERE ARE PEOPLE ARE YOU

00:20:49.681 --> 00:20:51.016
TALKING ABOUT THE RISKS.

00:20:51.083 --> 00:20:51.984
WHEN YOU SEE STORIES ABOUT

00:20:52.050 --> 00:20:53.151
FACIAL RECOGNITION IN YOUR

00:20:53.218 --> 00:20:53.752
WALKING THE REPORTS AND GUESS

00:20:53.819 --> 00:20:54.453
WHAT?

00:20:54.519 --> 00:20:55.887
THEY'RE GOING TO PROFILE YOU

00:20:55.954 --> 00:20:57.923
THAT MAKES PEOPLE ANXIOUS WHEN

00:20:57.990 --> 00:20:59.257
THERE ARE REPORTS THAT HAVE BEEN

00:20:59.324 --> 00:21:01.059
PUT OUT.

00:21:01.126 --> 00:21:04.262
BY -- CERTAIN -- FOR COMPANIES

00:21:04.329 --> 00:21:05.397
THAT EVALUATE IMPACTS OF A AYE

00:21:05.464 --> 00:21:07.532
UNEMPLOYMENT AND PREDICTS 60%

00:21:07.599 --> 00:21:09.968
LOSSES IN JOBS THAT MAKES PEOPLE

00:21:10.035 --> 00:21:11.737
SCARED.

00:21:11.803 --> 00:21:13.171
AND THE RESPONSES TO TURN TO YOU.

00:21:13.238 --> 00:21:15.340
AND SAY I DON'T WANT.

00:21:15.407 --> 00:21:16.441
TO I DON'T WANT TO LOSE MY JOB

00:21:16.508 --> 00:21:18.777
BECAUSE A I HAS CHANGED I AM A

00:21:18.844 --> 00:21:19.778
TO THE WORKPLACE.

00:21:19.845 --> 00:21:21.179
AND YOU'LL GET PRESSURE UNLESS

00:21:21.246 --> 00:21:22.748
IT'S HANDLED CORRECTLY TO DO

IS.

00:23:16.194 --> 00:23:17.863
THERE WERE SOME PEOPLE IN THE A

00:23:17.929 --> 00:23:18.897
COMMUNITY THAT WERE A LITTLE

00:23:18.964 --> 00:23:20.632

END UP DOING ALL THESE DIFFERENT

00:23:27.005 --> 00:23:28.306
THINGS AND SCARED AND SCARE

00:23:28.373 --> 00:23:29.975
PEOPLE TO DEATH.

00:23:30.041 --> 00:23:31.877
THAT PERSPECTIVE IS CHANGE.

00:23:31.943 --> 00:23:34.679
IN IN IN IN A COUPLE WAYS NOW I

00:23:34.746 --> 00:23:36.548
SEE THEM CALLED CALL BOX.

00:23:36.615 --> 00:23:38.016
THERE WILL BE THE APPLICATION OF

00:23:38.083 --> 00:23:38.884
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE THAT

00:23:38.950 --> 00:23:41.353
WILL WORK COOPERATIVELY WITH.

00:23:41.419 --> 00:23:43.688
THE EMPLOYEE. TO GET THE TASK

00:23:43.755 --> 00:23:45.624

REPETITIVE SORT OF MINDLESS.

00:23:46.925 --> 00:23:49.094
NUMBING KINDS OF THINGS THAT

PROBLEMS ALL.

00:23:56.468 --> 00:23:58.804
SO THEY TALK ABOUT WORKING IN

00:23:58.870 --> 00:24:00.372
COOPERATION -- YOU LOOK AT AN

00:24:00.438 --> 00:24:02.474
APPLICATION FOR EXAMPLE IN

00:24:02.541 --> 00:24:03.208

CONDITIONS THAT ARE.

00:24:14.252 --> 00:24:15.587
OBSERVED ON THE GROUND SO IN THE

00:24:15.654 --> 00:24:17.055
END IS A GOOD PLACE.

00:24:17.122 --> 00:24:18.623
MASSACHUSETTS HAS ESTABLISHED A

00:24:18.690 --> 00:24:20.425
COMMISSION ON DIGITAL INNOVATION

00:24:20.492 --> 00:24:21.726
AND LIFELONG LEARNING.

00:24:21.793 --> 00:24:23.962
THAT'S ANOTHER ASPECT OF THIS

00:24:24.029 --> 00:24:24.362
THAT.

00:24:24.429 --> 00:24:27.265
THE CAN BE VERY BENEFICIAL

00:24:27.332 --> 00:24:28.767
BECAUSE YOU HAVE OLDER.

00:24:28.834 --> 00:24:32.871

THE OTHER DAY NO NO NO THE

00:24:45.116 --> 00:24:46.618
FUTURE SIX TEN NINETY NINES.

00:24:46.685 --> 00:24:47.819
PEOPLE ARE GONNA BE HAVING ON A

00:24:47.886 --> 00:24:50.155
LOT OF DIFFERENT JOBS OVER THE

00:24:50.222 --> 00:24:50.722
COURSE OF A LIFETIME MINUTES

00:24:50.789 --> 00:24:52.290
COMING TRUE.

00:24:52.357 --> 00:24:53.024
A FEW PEOPLE HAVE LIFETIME JOBS

00:24:53.091 --> 00:24:54.426
ANYMORE.

00:24:54.492 --> 00:24:56.228
SO HEY I IS GOING TO PLAY AN

00:24:56.294 --> 00:24:57.495
IMPORTANT ROLE IF IT'S APPLIED.

DON'T LOSE THE EXPERIENCE OF

00:25:02.067 --> 00:25:03.635
THOSE THAT HAVE BEEN WORKING.

00:25:03.702 --> 00:25:05.237
AND THAT THEY CAN CONTINUE TO

00:25:05.303 --> 00:25:07.672
GROW AND DEVELOP AND AND MAKE A

00:25:07.739 --> 00:25:09.241
CONTRIBUTION.

00:25:09.307 --> 00:25:09.875
THE NOTION OF WORK IS GOING TO

00:25:09.941 --> 00:25:11.276
CHANGE.

00:25:11.343 --> 00:25:13.111
OVER TIME BECAUSE OF A I WHAT IT

00:25:13.178 --> 00:25:14.880
IS THAT WE ARE YOU KNOW I WORK

00:25:14.946 --> 00:25:15.847
FOR A WHILE IN A STEEL MILL.

00:25:15.914 --> 00:25:17.482
YOU CAN'T HAVE ANYTHING MORE

00:25:17.549 --> 00:25:19.017
MACHO THAN THAT RIGHT.

00:25:19.084 --> 00:25:20.452
THERE'S LIKE METAL FLYING ALL

00:25:20.518 --> 00:25:21.519
OVER THE PLACE IF YOU'RE IN THE

00:25:21.586 --> 00:25:23.388
WRONG PLACE AT THE WRONG TIME TO

00:25:23.455 --> 00:25:25.657
GET BURNED IN YOUR SEAT AFTER-YOU GET THE MOVE STUFF.

00:25:25.724 --> 00:25:26.491
THAT WAS GREAT.

00:25:26.558 --> 00:25:28.693
BUT THAT'LL CHANGE AND IT HAS

00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:29.461
CHANGED.

00:25:29.527 --> 00:25:30.528
INTO WHERE YOU JUST PUSH THE

00:25:30.595 --> 00:25:32.063
BUTTON AND THOSE SYSTEMS

00:25:32.130 --> 00:25:34.266
CONTINUE TO GO.

00:25:34.332 --> 00:25:34.633
I READ A BOOK.

00:25:34.699 --> 00:25:38.570
AND THIS AUTHORS PERSPECTIVE WAS.

00:25:38.637 --> 00:25:41.039
THIS A AYE REVOLUTION IS

00:25:41.106 --> 00:25:42.540
DIFFERENT FROM AUTOMATION.

00:25:42.607 --> 00:25:43.875
IN THE AUTOMATION.

00:25:43.942 --> 00:25:46.578
WE CREATED MACHINES THAT WOULD

00:25:46.645 --> 00:25:48.647
DO THE WORK THAT PEOPLE WERE

00:25:48.713 --> 00:25:49.581
DOING.

00:25:49.648 --> 00:25:51.983
RIGHT BUT A HIGH IS DOING THE

00:25:52.050 --> 00:25:53.985
THINKING.

00:25:54.052 --> 00:25:55.353
THAT IS IT THAT IS A DRAMATIC

00:25:55.420 --> 00:25:57.188
SHIFT.

00:25:57.255 --> 00:25:59.124
AND IT'S NOT.

00:25:59.190 --> 00:26:00.892
VIED FOR MEMBERS OPPORTUNITIES

00:26:00.959 --> 00:26:02.260
FOR US

00:26:02.327 --> 00:26:02.861
AND IT ALSO CARRIES WITH IT

00:26:02.928 --> 00:26:04.329
RISKS.

00:26:04.396 --> 00:26:06.031
AND I DO THINK THAT THE THE ROLE

00:26:06.097 --> 00:26:08.199
OF THE LEGISLATURE AND OTHER

00:26:08.266 --> 00:26:09.401
POLICY MAKERS LIKE YOURSELVES.

00:26:09.467 --> 00:26:11.536
IS IN EXPLORING THOUGH SO THAT

00:26:11.603 --> 00:26:12.804
WE UNDERSTAND IT WELL.

00:26:12.871 --> 00:26:14.839
AND KNOW HOW TO COMMUNICATE IT

00:26:14.906 --> 00:26:15.974
TO OTHERS TO HELP.

00:26:16.041 --> 00:26:17.943
MAKE THEM FEEL BETTER ABOUT THE

00:26:18.009 --> 00:26:20.812
CHANGES ARE COMING.

SUPERVISION OF ANDREW MCCOLLUM

00:27:52.704 --> 00:27:54.539
DURING WHICH HE ALSO INTERNED AT

00:27:54.606 --> 00:27:55.673
MICROSOFT.

00:27:55.740 --> 00:27:57.642
RESEARCH GOOGLE RESEARCH AND

00:27:57.709 --> 00:27:58.676
YAHOO LABS.

00:27:58.743 --> 00:27:59.844
HE WAS AWARDED THE ADOBE

00:27:59.911 --> 00:28:01.379

00:28:09.220 --> 00:28:10.388
AND RECEIVE THE YAHOO KEY

00:28:10.455 --> 00:28:12.824
SCIENTIFIC CHALLENGE AWARD.

00:28:12.891 --> 00:28:14.259
A DOCTOR SINGLE GIVE US A

00:28:14.325 --> 00:28:16.461
GENERAL OVERVIEW OF A AYE -- IN

00:28:16.528 --> 00:28:17.962
TALK ABOUT MULTIPLE WAYS TO

00:28:18.029 --> 00:28:19.798
REDUCE BIAS IN A AYE INCLUDING

00:28:19.864 --> 00:28:21.366
INCREASING DIVERSITY.

00:28:21.433 --> 00:28:22.467
IN A AYE TECHNOLOGIES THE

00:28:22.534 --> 00:28:23.935
IMPORTANCE OF DATA LABELING

00:28:24.002 --> 00:28:25.070
COLLECTION.

00:28:25.136 --> 00:28:27.105
INSURING LESS BIAS IN INPUT DATA

00:28:27.172 --> 00:28:29.507
AND UTILIZING MACHINE LEARNING

00:28:29.574 --> 00:28:32.677
TO CHECK A EYES OUTPUT. FOR BY

00:28:32.744 --> 00:28:34.612
SEIZE -- DOCTOR SAYING LOOK THE

00:28:34.679 --> 00:28:36.114
FLOOR IS YOURS MAYBE START BY

00:28:36.181 --> 00:28:37.916
TELLING US WHAT A DARK ARISE OR

00:28:37.982 --> 00:28:38.716
IS.

00:28:38.783 --> 00:28:40.418
THAT WAS JUST SOMETHING THAT ARE

00:28:40.485 --> 00:28:42.287
PRO WAS LOOKING OUT FOR YOUNG

00:28:42.353 --> 00:28:49.194
SCIENTISTS TO SORT OF LOOK AT AS

00:28:49.260 --> 00:28:53.031
FUTURE.

00:28:53.098 --> 00:28:53.331
PEOPLE WHO.

00:28:53.398 --> 00:28:55.500
ARE USED TO REMEMBER WHAT DARPA

00:28:55.567 --> 00:28:56.501
STOOD FOR WHAT DOES IT STAND FOR

00:28:56.568 --> 00:29:00.672
DEFENDS IN BONDS RESEARCH.

00:29:00.738 --> 00:29:02.073
BEING ADMINISTRATION STANDS FOR

00:29:02.140 --> 00:29:03.508
DARPA YEAH THEY WON'T BE HAPPY

00:29:03.575 --> 00:29:04.809
THAT I DON'T KNOW WHAT.

00:29:04.876 --> 00:29:06.511
OKAY ALL RIGHT ALL RIGHT WELL

00:29:06.578 --> 00:29:10.515
SORRY FOR THAT -- ALL RIGHT --

00:29:10.582 --> 00:29:11.149
DOCTOR SAYING THAT THE FLOOR IS

00:29:11.216 --> 00:29:12.117
YOURS.

00:29:12.183 --> 00:29:13.585
THANK YOU YEAH SO I'M GOING TO

00:29:13.651 --> 00:29:15.587
GIVE A OVERVIEW OFF A I TRIED TO

00:29:15.653 --> 00:29:18.223
KEEP IT PRETTY ON NON TECHNICAL --

00:29:18.289 --> 00:29:19.791
AND THEN I'LL ENTERTAIN

00:29:19.858 --> 00:29:20.592
QUESTIONS AT THE END.

00:29:20.658 --> 00:29:22.660
SO JUST THINKING ABOUT WHAT A

00:29:22.727 --> 00:29:23.962
AYE IS VERY BROADLY SPEAKING

00:29:24.028 --> 00:29:26.598
IT'S DEFINED AS ANY SOFTWARE --

00:29:26.664 --> 00:29:32.036
THAT IS ABLE TO CARRY OUT

00:29:32.103 --> 00:29:34.305
COGNITIVE DOS.

00:29:34.372 --> 00:29:35.106
SAMPLES OF COGNITIVE TASKS

00:29:35.173 --> 00:29:36.508
INCLUDE THINGS LIKE DRIVING ON

00:29:36.574 --> 00:29:38.376
TRANSLATING LANGUAGES ANSWERING

00:29:38.443 --> 00:29:39.878
QUESTIONS ABOUT THE WORLD --

00:29:39.944 --> 00:29:41.279
BEING ABLE TO DIAGNOSE DISEASE.

00:29:41.346 --> 00:29:42.780
OF PLAYING GAMES UNDERSTANDING

00:29:42.847 --> 00:29:44.249
SPEECH THESE ARE ALL SORT OF

00:29:44.315 --> 00:29:46.484
HIGHER LEVEL COGNITIVE COSTS AND

00:29:46.551 --> 00:29:48.119
IF A SOFTWARE.

00:29:48.186 --> 00:29:50.588
THAT'S ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE --

00:29:50.655 --> 00:29:51.689
UNFORTUNATELY THE STIFF

00:29:51.756 --> 00:29:53.057
DEFINITIONS START REALLY USEFUL

00:29:53.124 --> 00:29:54.292
IT'S NOT VERY PRECISE PARTLY

00:29:54.359 --> 00:29:56.094
BECAUSE PEOPLE DON'T TEND TO

00:29:56.161 --> 00:29:57.462
AGREE WITH WHAT THE COGNITIVE

00:29:57.529 --> 00:29:59.063
COSTS ARE.

00:29:59.130 --> 00:30:00.832
AND THERE IS THIS AND THIS

00:30:00.899 --> 00:30:02.834
NOTION KNOWN AS A AYE EFFECT.

00:30:02.901 --> 00:30:04.569
WHERE IF A COMPUTER CAN DO IT WE

00:30:04.636 --> 00:30:06.271
DON'T THINK OF IT AS AN

00:30:06.337 --> 00:30:07.739
INTELLIGENT ASK ANYMORE -- AND

00:30:07.805 --> 00:30:09.073
SO THE DEFINITION OF A I SORT OF

00:30:09.140 --> 00:30:11.709
CHANGES AS WE GET BETTER AT

00:30:11.776 --> 00:30:13.811
DOING A AYE -- SO INSTEAD WHAT'S

00:30:13.878 --> 00:30:15.380
MUCH MORE USEFUL IS TO THINK

00:30:15.446 --> 00:30:18.016
ABOUT WHY A AYE IS CURRENTLY.

00:30:18.082 --> 00:30:19.384
ON TRANSFORMING SOCIETY AND IT'S

00:30:19.450 --> 00:30:21.853
IT'S REALLY IN THE CENTER FOR

00:30:21.920 --> 00:30:23.321
YOU -- AND THAT IS TO LOOK AT

00:30:23.388 --> 00:30:25.423
MACHINE LEARNING THIS IS OF THIS

00:30:25.490 --> 00:30:27.192
IS WHAT MAJORITY OF AA LOOKS

00:30:27.258 --> 00:30:28.726
LIKE RIGHT NOW YOU MIGHT HAVE

00:30:28.793 --> 00:30:33.698
HEARD OF MACHINE LEARNING ALMOST

00:30:33.765 --> 00:30:36.634
INTERCHANGEABLY BUT THEY I AND

00:30:36.701 --> 00:30:38.303
THE IDEA HERE IS THAT.

00:30:38.369 --> 00:30:39.571
MACHINE LEARNING IS TRYING TO

00:30:39.637 --> 00:30:41.606
CREATE SOFTWARE -- THAT LOANS TO

00:30:41.673 --> 00:30:43.208
WHAT TO DO FROM EXAMPLES.

00:30:43.274 --> 00:30:44.442
IN OTHER WORDS IT'S TRYING TO

00:30:44.509 --> 00:30:46.144
IMPROVE AUTOMATICALLY WITH

00:30:46.211 --> 00:30:46.945
EXPERIENCE.

00:30:47.011 --> 00:30:48.446
AND IF IT IMPROVES TO THE EXTENT

00:30:48.513 --> 00:30:51.249
THAT IT CAN DO THE INTELLIGENT

00:30:51.316 --> 00:30:52.083
COGNITIVE PROCESS.

00:30:52.150 --> 00:30:56.387
THEN -- YOU HAVE IN A A SOFTWARE.

00:30:56.454 --> 00:30:57.956
SO JUST TO BE MORE PRECISE LET'S

00:30:58.022 --> 00:30:58.356
STICK OR EXAMPLE.

00:30:58.423 --> 00:31:00.024
SUPPOSE YOU NEED SOME SOFTWARE

00:31:00.091 --> 00:31:02.727
THAT CAN TAKE ONE FOR DOLE --

00:31:02.794 --> 00:31:05.163
AND TELL YOU WHETHER THAT. FOR

00:31:05.230 --> 00:31:08.299
TO OFTEN ANIMAL IS A WOLF OR A

00:31:08.366 --> 00:31:11.769
HUSKY ON HUSKIES A BREED OF DOG

00:31:11.836 --> 00:31:13.137
THAT LOOKS A LOT LIKE A WOLF --

00:31:13.204 --> 00:31:14.272
AND SO THE IDEA IS THAT IF YOU

00:31:14.339 --> 00:31:16.140
GIVE THE FIRST IMAGE TO THE

00:31:16.207 --> 00:31:18.509
SOFTWARE IT SHOULD BE ABLE TO

00:31:18.576 --> 00:31:19.777
TELL YOU ABOUT THE WORLD BECAUSE

00:31:19.844 --> 00:31:20.945
IT IS.

00:31:21.012 --> 00:31:21.846
AND IF YOU GIVE IT A SECOND

00:31:21.913 --> 00:31:23.715
IMAGE IT SHOULD BE ABLE TO TELL

00:31:23.781 --> 00:31:25.049
YOU THAT'S A HUSKY.

00:31:25.116 --> 00:31:26.050
I SAID TO GIVE YOU SOME IN

00:31:26.117 --> 00:31:29.187
TUITION FOR HALL OF THE SOFTWARE

00:31:29.254 --> 00:31:30.188
IS SORT OF LOOKED.

00:31:30.255 --> 00:31:31.389
THE WAY THE MACHINE LEARNING

00:31:31.456 --> 00:31:32.123
BOOKS.

00:31:32.190 --> 00:31:34.359
IS YOU HAVE THE STEP OF TRAINING

00:31:34.425 --> 00:31:36.027
AND AND SO WHAT YOU WOULD DO

00:31:36.094 --> 00:31:37.095
HERE IS YOU WOULD COLLECT A LOT

00:31:37.161 --> 00:31:43.234
OF EXAMPLES OF FOUR DOORS OF

00:31:43.301 --> 00:31:44.602
WHEELS.

00:31:44.669 --> 00:31:45.903
ANOTHER SET OF EXAMPLES OF

00:31:45.970 --> 00:31:47.572
PHOTOS OF HUSKIES AND YOU WOULD

00:31:47.639 --> 00:31:49.574
USE THEM TO TRAIN YOUR SOFTWARE --

00:31:49.641 --> 00:31:50.742
SO THE SOFTWARE WOULD LOOK AT

00:31:50.808 --> 00:31:51.876
ALL OF THESE EXAMPLES.

00:31:51.943 --> 00:31:53.177
AND IT'LL.

00:31:53.244 --> 00:31:55.046
FROM THESE EXAMPLES LOW AND WHAT

00:31:55.113 --> 00:31:57.215
MAKES A WILL FOR WOLF AND WHAT

00:31:57.282 --> 00:31:58.816
MAKES A HUSKY A HUSKY.

00:31:58.883 --> 00:32:01.352
AND STORE SOME REPRESENTATION OF

00:32:01.419 --> 00:32:02.920
THIS KNOWLEDGE INTERNALLY.

00:32:02.987 --> 00:32:04.589
AND THEN WHEN YOU ACTUALLY WANT

00:32:04.656 --> 00:32:07.258
TO USE IT -- YOU BASICALLY ALSO

00:32:07.325 --> 00:32:09.594
GET TO GUESS ON NEW IMAGES.

00:32:09.661 --> 00:32:12.163
SO ONCE THE SOFTWARE IS TRAINED

00:32:12.230 --> 00:32:14.699
YOU GIVE IT A NEW FOR DON'T --

00:32:14.766 --> 00:32:16.067
AND THE SOFTWARE WILL USE WHAT

00:32:16.134 --> 00:32:17.435
IT HAS SEEN ALL YEAR TO MAKE A

00:32:17.502 --> 00:32:18.770
GUESS.

00:32:18.836 --> 00:32:20.805
IF IT SUCCESSFULLY TRAINED THEN

00:32:20.872 --> 00:32:22.307
IT WILL GET IT -- RIGHT MORE

00:32:22.373 --> 00:32:24.509
OFTEN THAN IT WILL NOT AND IF

00:32:24.575 --> 00:32:26.210
YOU GET A DATE.

00:32:26.277 --> 00:32:29.447
ALMOST 100% IF IT'S REALLY

00:32:29.514 --> 00:32:30.915
REALLY GOOD.

00:32:30.982 --> 00:32:32.250
SO IN THIS EXAMPLE THAT I'VE

00:32:32.317 --> 00:32:33.351
BEEN TALKING ABOUT THESE ARE SIX

00:32:33.418 --> 00:32:34.652
FOUR DOES THAT IT HAS NEVER SEEN

00:32:34.719 --> 00:32:37.555
BEFORE -- AND THE SOFTWARE THAT

00:32:37.622 --> 00:32:38.423
WE TRAINED.

00:32:38.489 --> 00:32:40.191
GETS A GRADE FIVE OF THE SIX

00:32:40.258 --> 00:32:41.359
TIMES -- WHICH IS QUITE

00:32:41.426 --> 00:32:44.896
IMPRESSIVE IT'S ACTUALLY -- YOU

00:32:44.962 --> 00:32:46.798
MIGHT SAY THAT AS LOAN HOLDEN

00:32:46.864 --> 00:32:48.232
FRIEND SHARED BETWEEN WILSON

00:32:48.299 --> 00:32:49.567
HUSKY THAT CASE IT'S A DOING A

00:32:49.634 --> 00:32:52.470
BETTER JOB THAN I WOULD SO.

00:32:52.537 --> 00:32:55.606
THAT'S THAT'S SOMETHING.

00:32:55.673 --> 00:32:57.141
ARM AND SO LET'S THINK A LITTLE

00:32:57.208 --> 00:32:58.042
BIT BROADLY ABOUT WHAT THE

00:32:58.109 --> 00:33:00.511
MACHINE LEARNING ACTUALLY IS --

00:33:00.578 --> 00:33:01.312
AND SO THE IDEA WITH MACHINE

00:33:01.379 --> 00:33:02.513
LEARNING IS THAT WHATEVER

00:33:02.580 --> 00:33:03.881
PROBLEM YOU'RE INTERESTED IN YOU

00:33:03.948 --> 00:33:05.817
SORT OF SPLIT IT INTO WHAT IS

00:33:05.883 --> 00:33:07.318
GOING TO BE THE INPUT TO YOUR

00:33:07.385 --> 00:33:08.820
SYSTEM.

00:33:08.886 --> 00:33:10.288
AND WHAT IS GOING TO BE THE

00:33:10.355 --> 00:33:13.691
OUTPUT -- AND YOU FIRST GATHERED

00:33:13.758 --> 00:33:15.493
BEARS OF INPUT AND OUTPUT THAT

00:33:15.560 --> 00:33:17.095
YOU USED TO TRAIN YOUR MACHINE

00:33:17.161 --> 00:33:18.896
LEARNING ALGORITHMS -- AND

00:33:18.963 --> 00:33:19.697
MACHINE LEARNING ARE GOOD THEM

00:33:19.764 --> 00:33:21.399
ONCE IT STRAINED IT GIVES YOU

00:33:21.466 --> 00:33:23.534
THE SOFTWARE -- THAT WILL TAKE

00:33:23.601 --> 00:33:26.604
NEW IN BOTH STUDIED HASN'T SEEN

00:33:26.671 --> 00:33:27.939
BEFORE.

00:33:28.005 --> 00:33:29.841
AND TRY TO GUESS WHAT THE OUTPUT

00:33:29.907 --> 00:33:31.776
WITH -- THREE SO LET'S LOOK AT A

00:33:31.843 --> 00:33:32.844
FEW EXAMPLES SO IF YOU WANT TO

00:33:32.910 --> 00:33:33.378
CREATE A MACHINE LEARNING

00:33:33.444 --> 00:33:34.412
SOFTWARE THAT CAN PREDICT

00:33:34.479 --> 00:33:36.280
WHETHER LOAN SHOULD BE GRANTED

00:33:36.347 --> 00:33:37.148
OR NOT.

00:33:37.215 --> 00:33:38.483
THE INPUT HERE WOULD BE THE

00:33:38.549 --> 00:33:40.084
DETAILS OF THE LOAN APPLICATION

00:33:40.151 --> 00:33:42.387
EVERYTHING THAT WOULD OTHERWISE

00:33:42.453 --> 00:33:43.588
GO IN THE LOAN APPLICATION.

00:33:43.654 --> 00:33:45.623
AND THE OUTPUT WILL BE WHETHER

00:33:45.690 --> 00:33:46.758
THE LOAN.

00:33:46.824 --> 00:33:48.159
WILL BE SUCCESSFUL OR NOT IF

00:33:48.226 --> 00:33:49.460
GRANTED.

00:33:49.527 --> 00:33:50.762
AND WHAT YOU WOULD DO IS YOU

00:33:50.828 --> 00:33:53.398
WOULD USE BOSS DATA TO COLLECT --

00:33:53.464 --> 00:33:55.433
SUCH EXAMPLES AND USE THAT TO

00:33:55.500 --> 00:33:57.268
TRAIN YOUR MACHINE LEARNING

00:33:57.335 --> 00:33:59.137
ALGORITHMS SO IN BOSTON.

00:33:59.203 --> 00:34:01.773
YOU GROUND SOME LOANS AND THE

00:34:01.839 --> 00:34:03.374
PERSON I DID NOT WANT TO PAY IT

00:34:03.441 --> 00:34:03.574
BACK.

00:34:03.641 --> 00:34:07.645
THAT'S A BAD APPLICATION ARE BAD

00:34:07.712 --> 00:34:09.614
LOAN APPLICATION.

00:34:09.680 --> 00:34:10.581
IF YOU WANT TO DIAGNOSE DISEASES

00:34:10.648 --> 00:34:11.215
WHAT YOU WOULD DO IS YOUR INPUT

00:34:11.282 --> 00:34:12.250
WOULD BE ALL OF THE PATIENTS

00:34:12.316 --> 00:34:15.420
SYMPTOMS THAT'S NUMBER TWO THERE.

00:34:15.486 --> 00:34:17.121
AND YOUR OUTPUT WOULD BE THE

00:34:17.188 --> 00:34:19.957
DISEASE THAT THE PATIENT HAS AND

00:34:20.024 --> 00:34:21.225
FOR TRAINING PURPOSES YOU WOULD

00:34:21.292 --> 00:34:25.029
GATHER DATA BY HAVING A DOCTOR

00:34:25.096 --> 00:34:25.630
DECIDE WITH THE DISEASE SHOULD

00:34:25.696 --> 00:34:26.597
BE.

00:34:26.664 --> 00:34:29.200
OUR AND SORT OF USING THAT DRAIN

00:34:29.267 --> 00:34:30.835
YOUR SOFTWARE.

00:34:30.902 --> 00:34:31.502
FINALLY THIS TAKE ANOTHER

00:34:31.569 --> 00:34:33.304
EXAMPLE OF CONSOLATION WHERE.

00:34:33.371 --> 00:34:34.605
YOU WANT TO TRANSLATE FROM

00:34:34.672 --> 00:34:36.574
ENGLISH TO SPANISH FOR EXAMPLE

00:34:36.641 --> 00:34:37.809
YOU MIGHT DO THAT ON GOOGLE

00:34:37.875 --> 00:34:39.043
TRANSLATE.

00:34:39.110 --> 00:34:41.012
THE INPUT HERE WOULD BE A

00:34:41.078 --> 00:34:42.113
ENGLISH SENTENCE.

00:34:42.180 --> 00:34:44.682
AND THE OUTPUT HERE IS GOING TO

00:34:44.749 --> 00:34:47.018
BE A SPINE IF AND BANDS AND SO

00:34:47.084 --> 00:34:49.320
AGAIN TO TRAIN AND YOU RIGHT TO

00:34:49.387 --> 00:34:51.956
THE SPANISH SENTENCE -- BY A

00:34:52.023 --> 00:34:55.760
TRANSLATOR AND GIVE THAT AS AN

00:34:55.827 --> 00:34:57.995
EXAMPLE TO THE SOFTWARE.

00:34:58.062 --> 00:34:59.997
AND SO ONCE THIS TRAINING IS

00:35:00.064 --> 00:35:01.299
FINISHED YOU GET A SOFTWARE

00:35:01.365 --> 00:35:03.601
WHICH CAN TAKE ANY NEW INPUT.

00:35:03.668 --> 00:35:05.203
AND PREDICT WHAT ABOUT WHAT

00:35:05.269 --> 00:35:06.437
WOULD BE SO SHOULD BE ABLE TO

00:35:06.504 --> 00:35:08.005
TAKE.

00:35:08.072 --> 00:35:09.507
A NEW PATIENT IN ALL OF ITS

00:35:09.574 --> 00:35:11.542
SYMPTOMS AND IT CAN PREDICT WHAT

00:35:11.609 --> 00:35:13.845
THE DISEASE THE PATIENT HOUSE.

00:35:13.911 --> 00:35:16.781
OF WITHOUT THE NEED OF A DOCTOR

00:35:16.848 --> 00:35:18.583
AT THAT POINT.

00:35:18.649 --> 00:35:19.951
I TO BE ABLE TO TAKE A ENGLISH

00:35:20.017 --> 00:35:22.386
SENTENCE AND GIVE YOU THE FINEST

00:35:22.453 --> 00:35:22.987
SENTENCE WITHOUT THE NEED OF A

00:35:23.054 --> 00:35:24.755
TRANSIT.

00:35:24.822 --> 00:35:27.658
SO ONE OF THE MAJOR QUESTIONS AS

00:35:27.725 --> 00:35:29.160
WELL WHY DOES IT WORK AND HOW IS

00:35:29.227 --> 00:35:32.230
IT ABLE -- TO WISE MACHINE

00:35:32.296 --> 00:35:33.998
LEARNING SO SO PREVALENT.

00:35:34.065 --> 00:35:36.133
AND HEAR A SORT OF THE TWO

00:35:36.200 --> 00:35:37.101
PRIMARY REASONS.

00:35:37.168 --> 00:35:38.870
OF WHICH COMBINED TOGETHER TO

00:35:38.936 --> 00:35:42.073
MAKE MACHINE LEARNING WORKED THE

00:35:42.139 --> 00:35:43.174
WAY IT DOES SAY NOW.

00:35:43.241 --> 00:35:44.275
THE FIRST IS THAT A WHOLE LOT OF

00:35:44.342 --> 00:35:46.577
EXAMPLES ARE AVAILABLE -- TO

00:35:46.644 --> 00:35:47.879
TRAIN SOFT RIGHT NOW THIS IS

00:35:47.945 --> 00:35:49.947
MOSTLY WITH THE BIG DATA LUCIEN

00:35:50.014 --> 00:35:53.818
BUT STORAGE COMPETITION BEING J.

00:35:53.885 --> 00:35:54.886
CHEAP WITH PROFIT PERFORATION OF

00:35:54.952 --> 00:35:56.754
INTERNET WE JUST HAVE A LOT OF

00:35:56.821 --> 00:35:57.788
EXAMPLES.

00:35:57.855 --> 00:36:02.693
PRETTY MUCH ANY DOS THAT -- THAT

00:36:02.760 --> 00:36:03.427
ARE AVAILABLE TO TRAIN MACHINE

00:36:03.494 --> 00:36:06.697
LEARNING ALGORITHMS -- TO

00:36:06.764 --> 00:36:08.366
ANYBODY WHO STORING ANY KIND OF

00:36:08.432 --> 00:36:11.669
DATA CAN POTENTIALLY USE IT AS A

00:36:11.736 --> 00:36:13.070
WAY TO TRAIN MACHINE RUNNING ON

00:36:13.137 --> 00:36:15.139
THE SECOND PART OF THIS WHOLE.

00:36:15.206 --> 00:36:16.207
PROCESS THAT MAKES MACHINE

00:36:16.274 --> 00:36:18.776
LEARNING -- SO PREVALENT IS THAT

00:36:18.843 --> 00:36:21.679
THERE IS A LOT OF COMPLEX MATH

00:36:21.746 --> 00:36:22.947
AND COMPETITION THAT'S INVOLVED.

00:36:23.014 --> 00:36:24.549
AND ASK COMPUTING BECOMES

00:36:24.615 --> 00:36:26.450
CHEAPER -- THE SOFTWARE

00:36:26.517 --> 00:36:28.853
INTERNALLY KEEPS BECOMING MORE

00:36:28.920 --> 00:36:30.121
AND MORE COMPLEX AND IT'S ABLE

00:36:30.187 --> 00:36:32.356
TO SUPPORT MORE COMPLEX.

00:36:32.423 --> 00:36:34.158
OPERATIONS.

00:36:34.225 --> 00:36:35.192
I'M THIS COMBINATION OF LOTS OF

00:36:35.259 --> 00:36:36.861
EXAMPLES AND LOT OF COMPETITION

00:36:36.928 --> 00:36:38.362
IS ACTUALLY QUITE AMAZING IF YOU

00:36:38.429 --> 00:36:40.798
HAVE ENOUGH DATA AND IF YOU HAVE

00:36:40.865 --> 00:36:43.067
ENOUGH COMPETITION -- THE GUESS

00:36:43.134 --> 00:36:44.468
IS THAT THEY ARE MADE BY THIS

00:36:44.535 --> 00:36:46.537
MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS CAN

00:36:46.604 --> 00:36:48.372
BE ARBITRARILY GOOD.

00:36:48.439 --> 00:36:49.874
SO YOU KNOW IN MANY CASES YOU

00:36:49.941 --> 00:36:51.208
MAY NOT HAVE AN UPDATE OR

00:36:51.275 --> 00:36:55.780
COMPETITION BUT IF YOU DO -- SO

00:36:55.846 --> 00:36:57.882
SKY'S THE LIMIT [inaudible]

00:36:57.949 --> 00:37:00.718
BEYOND [inaudible]

00:37:00.785 --> 00:37:03.020
SO ARM.

00:37:03.087 --> 00:37:05.556
I DO WANT TO GIVE A CABBIE OUT

00:37:05.623 --> 00:37:06.724
AND TALK A LITTLE BIT.

00:37:06.791 --> 00:37:09.493
ABOUT THIS -- IT'S NOT ALL JUST

00:37:09.560 --> 00:37:11.462
GOOD NEWS -- THE THE TING THAT

00:37:11.529 --> 00:37:12.463
HAPPENS WITH MACHINE LEARNING IS

00:37:12.530 --> 00:37:13.564
THAT IT'S TRYING TO MATCH THE

00:37:13.631 --> 00:37:17.735
OLD PORT THE BEST IT CAN --

00:37:17.802 --> 00:37:18.803
WHICH IS IN SOME SENSE MANY

00:37:18.869 --> 00:37:20.104
DIFFERENT FROM AN INTELLIGENT

00:37:20.171 --> 00:37:21.973
BEHAVIOR.

00:37:22.039 --> 00:37:23.240
WHAT MACHINE LEARNING IS REALLY

00:37:23.307 --> 00:37:25.076
GOOD AT IS MIMICKING INTELLIGENT

00:37:25.142 --> 00:37:26.944
BEHAVIOR? TO THE EXTENT THAT IT

00:37:27.011 --> 00:37:27.745
CAN.

00:37:27.812 --> 00:37:29.580
GET THE ANSWER RIGHT BUT THE

00:37:29.647 --> 00:37:31.215
REASONING PROCESS MAY NOT BE THE

00:37:31.282 --> 00:37:35.186
SAME AS WHAT WE WOULD DO.

00:37:35.252 --> 00:37:36.887
OTHERS ALSO GOING TO DO THE

00:37:36.954 --> 00:37:39.123
SECOND GABBY ART -- WHICH IS

00:37:39.190 --> 00:37:40.591
THAT IN MOST CASES THE

00:37:40.658 --> 00:37:42.226
UNDERLYING REASONING OFF THE

00:37:42.293 --> 00:37:44.428
SOFTWARE HOW IT CAME TO MAKE A

00:37:44.495 --> 00:37:45.930
DECISION.

00:37:45.997 --> 00:37:47.431
IS SOMETHING THAT IS NOT

00:37:47.498 --> 00:37:50.134
AVAILABLE -- IN ANY JUDITH FORM

00:37:50.201 --> 00:37:52.403
OR IN ANY ACCESSIBLE FORM THAT

00:37:52.470 --> 00:37:56.741
WE CAN EASILY GRADY AND OF IT --

00:37:56.807 --> 00:37:58.476
AND SO.

00:37:58.542 --> 00:38:01.612
THAT SORT OF CAUSES A LITTLE BIT

00:38:01.679 --> 00:38:02.713
OF A CONCEPT.

00:38:02.780 --> 00:38:04.115
AND THE COMBINATION OF THESE TWO

00:38:04.181 --> 00:38:05.349
MEANS THAT SOMETIMES MACHINE

00:38:05.416 --> 00:38:06.450
LEARNING ALGORITHMS THAT I WOULD

00:38:06.517 --> 00:38:07.485
SAY OFTEN MACHINE LEARNING

00:38:07.551 --> 00:38:08.586
ALGORITHMS.

00:38:08.653 --> 00:38:10.488
END UP CHEATING IN REYES THAT

00:38:10.554 --> 00:38:13.290
ARE NOT VERY OBVIOUS SO I GAVE

00:38:13.357 --> 00:38:16.427
YOU -- THIS WILL FOR AND HUSKY

00:38:16.494 --> 00:38:18.129
EXAMPLE IF IT DON'T DO IT.

00:38:18.195 --> 00:38:19.463
OF RETARDED LOOKED QUITE

00:38:19.530 --> 00:38:21.499
INTELLIGENT -- BUT ACTUALLY WHAT

00:38:21.565 --> 00:38:22.633
WAS HAPPENING AND I DIDN'T TELL

00:38:22.700 --> 00:38:23.668
YOU THIS.

00:38:23.734 --> 00:38:25.436
WAS THE FACT THAT IT WAS

00:38:25.503 --> 00:38:29.707
PRIMARILY DETECTING SNOWFALL IN

00:38:29.774 --> 00:38:32.376
THE IMAGE.

00:38:32.443 --> 00:38:33.210
SO ALL THIS OFFER WAS DOING WAS

00:38:33.277 --> 00:38:34.445
LOOKING FOR WHITE STUFF ON THE

00:38:34.512 --> 00:38:35.780
GROUND WHICH IS ACTUALLY PRETTY

00:38:35.846 --> 00:38:36.614
EASY TO DO.

00:38:36.681 --> 00:38:38.149
AND IF IT SAW WHITE STUFF ON THE

00:38:38.215 --> 00:38:40.651
GROUND IT PREDICTED WOLF AND IF

00:38:40.718 --> 00:38:42.153
IT DID NOT.

00:38:42.219 --> 00:38:43.387
A PREDICTED HUSKY.

00:38:43.454 --> 00:38:46.857
AND THAT WOULD ALSO EXPLAIN THE

00:38:46.924 --> 00:38:49.326
MISTAKE IT MAKES WHEN IT HAPPENS.

00:38:49.393 --> 00:38:51.128
ARMED.

00:38:51.195 --> 00:38:54.632
WITH IN A SNOWY ENVIRONMENT.

00:38:54.699 --> 00:38:56.233
BUT FOR THE STARS.

00:38:56.300 --> 00:38:57.535
CLEARLY THIS IS NOT INTENDED

00:38:57.601 --> 00:38:59.270
BEHAVIOR THIS IS NOT AS

00:38:59.336 --> 00:38:59.837
INTELLIGENT BEHAVIOR.

00:38:59.904 --> 00:39:01.505
BUT IN JUST IN TERMS OF NUMBER

00:39:01.572 --> 00:39:03.607
OF GUESSES THAT BOOK CORRECT IT

00:39:03.674 --> 00:39:07.378
CAUGHT -- REALLY REALLY HIGH ON

00:39:07.445 --> 00:39:08.946
THE HIGH SCORE.

00:39:09.013 --> 00:39:11.048
AND SO IF YOU COULD GET IT.

00:39:11.115 --> 00:39:12.683
TO EXPLAIN WHY IT WAS MAKING

00:39:12.750 --> 00:39:13.851
THESE DECISIONS YOU WOULD BE

00:39:13.918 --> 00:39:14.819
ABLE TO SPOT BUT THIS IS AN

00:39:14.885 --> 00:39:16.721
ERROR BUT THAT'S NOT SOMETHING

00:39:16.787 --> 00:39:18.656
THAT'S EASILY SUPPORTED IN

00:39:18.723 --> 00:39:20.891
MACHINE LEARNING AS WE KNOW

00:39:20.958 --> 00:39:21.192
[inaudible]

00:39:21.258 --> 00:39:22.927
SO.

00:39:22.993 --> 00:39:24.628
JUST TO SOME REYES -- THE TALKS

00:39:24.695 --> 00:39:25.696
SO FAR.

00:39:25.763 --> 00:39:28.132
WE HAVE DEFINED A A AS ANY

00:39:28.199 --> 00:39:30.534
SOFTWARE THAT CAN CARRY OUT

00:39:30.601 --> 00:39:33.170
INTELLIGENT COGNITIVE LEE --

00:39:33.237 --> 00:39:37.141
HEAVY DAS OF AND THE MOST

00:39:37.208 --> 00:39:39.043
PROMINENT APPROACH FOR ARE IS

00:39:39.110 --> 00:39:40.745
THIS IDEA OF MACHINE LEARNING.

00:39:40.811 --> 00:39:42.346
WHERE YOU JUST CREATE SOFTWARE

00:39:42.413 --> 00:39:44.782
THAT LOANS FROM EXPEDIENCE THOSE

00:39:44.849 --> 00:39:45.783
COMPLEX MOUNTAIN WALLS

00:39:45.850 --> 00:39:47.017
COMPETITION INVOLVED?

00:39:47.084 --> 00:39:48.652
BUT THERE IS ALSO THIS ASPECT OF

00:39:48.719 --> 00:39:51.355
EXPEDIENCE WHICH IS PURELY --

00:39:51.422 --> 00:39:52.690
GIVEN BY THE DATA YOU GIVE TO

00:39:52.757 --> 00:39:55.626
SYSTEM AND THE MORE EXAMPLES YOU

00:39:55.693 --> 00:39:58.028
GIVE THE MORE.

00:39:58.095 --> 00:39:59.063
ACCURATE IT GETS OF THE BETTER

00:39:59.130 --> 00:40:02.266
IT GETS AND THE MORE INTELLIGENT

00:40:02.333 --> 00:40:04.368
ITS ITS BEHAVIOR LOOKS.

00:40:04.435 --> 00:40:05.102
AND THEN THERE IS THE

00:40:05.169 --> 00:40:06.604
SIGNIFICANT EVERY OTHER TO

00:40:06.670 --> 00:40:08.239
DESTROYING TO MIMIC INTELLIGENCE

00:40:08.305 --> 00:40:09.473
THE BEST IT CAN.

00:40:09.540 --> 00:40:11.575
SINCE IT IS LEARNING FROM THE

00:40:11.642 --> 00:40:13.077
DATE OF THAT THAT THIS -- BEING

00:40:13.144 --> 00:40:14.011
PROVIDED.

00:40:14.078 --> 00:40:16.981
IT CAPTURES ALL THE PATTERNS

00:40:17.047 --> 00:40:18.916
THAT ARE IN THE DATA.

00:40:18.983 --> 00:40:20.718
THAT'S BOTH A POSITIVE AND A

00:40:20.785 --> 00:40:22.419
NEGATIVE ASPECT AS WE SAW IN THE

00:40:22.486 --> 00:40:24.655
WILL FOSSE CASE IT IS CAPTURING

00:40:24.722 --> 00:40:26.423
SOME SPOT ON BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT

00:40:26.490 --> 00:40:29.693
WE ALL WANT TO DO -- AND THE

00:40:29.760 --> 00:40:31.495
CONCERN IS THAT IN IN MOST REAL

00:40:31.562 --> 00:40:33.631
APPLICATIONS THERE'S ALWAYS

00:40:33.697 --> 00:40:35.766
UNDECIDABLE BY TONS AND THE DATE

00:40:35.833 --> 00:40:37.902
ARE -- THAT ARE BY A SEIZE THAT

00:40:37.968 --> 00:40:40.104
ARE PRESENT BECAUSE OF MISTAKES

00:40:40.171 --> 00:40:42.139
OF BECAUSE OF THE WAY SOCIETY'S

00:40:42.206 --> 00:40:43.040
DOCTOR RIGHT NOW.

00:40:43.107 --> 00:40:44.241
AND MACHINE LEARNING BY PICKING

00:40:44.308 --> 00:40:46.110
UP ON THESE SORT OF REINFORCES

00:40:46.177 --> 00:40:47.645
THE SAME.

00:40:47.711 --> 00:40:53.517
PRICES AND ITS OUTPUT AS WELL.

00:40:53.584 --> 00:40:54.785
SO THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT

00:40:54.852 --> 00:40:55.820
THING TO KEEP IN MIND AS WE

00:40:55.886 --> 00:40:58.856
THINK ABOUT MACHINE LEARNING.

00:40:58.923 --> 00:40:59.723
THAT'S ABOUT HALF FULL THANK YOU

00:40:59.790 --> 00:41:00.891
THANK YOU DOCTOR ZING THANK YOU

00:41:00.958 --> 00:41:01.492
FOR COMING TO VISIT WITH US A

00:41:01.559 --> 00:41:01.859
COUPLE THINGS.

00:41:01.926 --> 00:41:02.326
ONE IS OUR COLLECTIVE

00:41:02.393 --> 00:41:04.361
RESPONSIBILITY AS LEGISLATORS IS

00:41:04.428 --> 00:41:05.596
TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF LIFE

00:41:05.663 --> 00:41:06.997
OF CALIFORNIANS ARE AT LEAST TO

00:41:07.064 --> 00:41:08.766
PROTECT THE QUALITY OF LIFE IS

00:41:08.833 --> 00:41:11.268
THAT EXISTS -- AND SO WITH

00:41:11.335 --> 00:41:12.102
RESPECT TO ARTIFICIAL

00:41:12.169 --> 00:41:14.038
INTELLIGENCE YOU'VE -- DEDICATED

00:41:14.104 --> 00:41:15.539
YOUR YOUR LIFE TO THE

00:41:15.606 --> 00:41:17.875
DEVELOPMENT AND EXPLORATION. TWO

00:41:17.942 --> 00:41:19.510
QUESTIONS ONE WHAT ARE YOU MOST

00:41:19.577 --> 00:41:21.145
EXCITED ABOUT TERMS OF IMPROVING

00:41:21.212 --> 00:41:22.780
THE QUALITY OF LIFE CALIFORNIANS

00:41:22.847 --> 00:41:25.783
AND THEN THE SECOND QUESTION IS

00:41:25.850 --> 00:41:26.350
WHAT ARE YOU MOST CONCERNED

00:41:26.417 --> 00:41:28.919
ABOUT -- SO LET ME START WITH

00:41:28.986 --> 00:41:32.289
THE CONCERNED ABOUT ASPECT SO --

00:41:32.356 --> 00:41:33.257
I THINK THERE ARE A LOT OF

00:41:33.324 --> 00:41:35.125
POSITIVE RESULTS OF MACHINE

00:41:35.192 --> 00:41:37.161
LEARNING THAT SEEM PROMISING AND

00:41:37.228 --> 00:41:39.430
TRANSFORMATIVE. FOR MANY

00:41:39.496 --> 00:41:42.266
DIFFERENT AREAS OF BUT THE

00:41:42.333 --> 00:41:43.767
CABBIE OUT CERTAIN AREN'T READY

00:41:43.834 --> 00:41:45.269
RATHER UNDERSTOOD I THINK IT'S

00:41:45.336 --> 00:41:46.370
SOMETHING THAT.

00:41:46.437 --> 00:41:48.472
THE PEOPLE WHO ARE VERY CLOSE TO

00:41:48.539 --> 00:41:49.573
THE ALGORITHMS PROBABLY

00:41:49.640 --> 00:41:51.041
APPRECIATE BUT EVEN ONE STEP

00:41:51.108 --> 00:41:54.011
REMOVED IT'S DIFFICULT -- TO

00:41:54.078 --> 00:41:57.514
MAKE THAT DIVISION AND SO IF YOU.

00:41:57.581 --> 00:42:00.317
DON'T DO A GRADUAL OR INFORMED

00:42:00.384 --> 00:42:01.986
DOLE OUT OF MACHINE LEARNING A

00:42:02.052 --> 00:42:04.989
FOR ANY APPLICATION -- THAT ARE

00:42:05.055 --> 00:42:08.225
SORT OF OF THE CAN BE SIDE

00:42:08.292 --> 00:42:09.960
EFFECTS THAT YOU DON'T REALIZE

00:42:10.027 --> 00:42:12.229
SO -- WHETHER IT'S EIGHT IT

00:42:12.296 --> 00:42:13.764
MIGHT LOOK LIKE A NOT ALREADY

00:42:13.831 --> 00:42:15.933
HIGH STATE APPLICATION BUT IF

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:17.935
THAT OUR BIASES THERE THEY GET

00:42:18.002 --> 00:42:20.271
REINFORCED IN WAYS THAT -- WE

00:42:20.337 --> 00:42:22.039
DON'T QUITE UNDERSTAND RIGHT NOW

00:42:22.106 --> 00:42:24.208
SO.

00:42:24.275 --> 00:42:26.844
YOU KNOW PEOPLE USED TO THINK OF

00:42:26.911 --> 00:42:28.112
LOS STEAK PAYING WELL YOU CAN

00:42:28.178 --> 00:42:30.180
ALWAYS READ THE NEWS YOU WANT TO

00:42:30.247 --> 00:42:31.782
READ SO WHY DOES.

00:42:31.849 --> 00:42:33.617
RECOMMENDING USE MATTER SO MUCH

00:42:33.684 --> 00:42:36.287
BUT WE'VE SEEN -- IN THE BUS

00:42:36.353 --> 00:42:37.521
THAT WHAT PEOPLE REGIONALLY

00:42:37.588 --> 00:42:39.590
INFORMS THEIR DECISIONS WHEN

00:42:39.657 --> 00:42:41.525
THEY GO TO THE ELECTION -- AND

00:42:41.592 --> 00:42:42.593
SO.

00:42:42.660 --> 00:42:43.894
IF THERE ARE BIASES IN MACHINE

00:42:43.961 --> 00:42:44.895
LEARNING ALGORITHM THEY CAN GET

00:42:44.962 --> 00:42:47.164
AFFECTED IN WAYS THAT WE DON'T

00:42:47.231 --> 00:42:50.034
UNDERSTAND YET SO -- DID THE

00:42:50.100 --> 00:42:52.269
CAVEAT IS FOR THE ALLOWED TO BE

00:42:52.336 --> 00:42:54.338
INFORMED AND GRADUATE TO SOME

00:42:54.405 --> 00:42:57.541
DEGREE -- IN TERMS OF WHAT I'M

00:42:57.608 --> 00:42:59.476
MOST EXCITED ABOUT -- MY

00:42:59.543 --> 00:43:00.844
RESEARCH IS.

00:43:00.911 --> 00:43:04.148
PRIMARILY FOCUSED ON BEING ABLE.

00:43:04.214 --> 00:43:09.820
TO READ AND UNDERSTAND TEXT --

00:43:09.887 --> 00:43:11.388
AND SO.

00:43:11.455 --> 00:43:13.390
NG ABLE TO INGEST A LOT OF TEXT

00:43:13.457 --> 00:43:14.191
AND BEING ABLE TO OUR ANSWER ANY

00:43:14.258 --> 00:43:16.160
QUESTION ABOUT IT BEING ABLE TO

00:43:16.226 --> 00:43:17.528
EXTRACT INFORMATION ABOUT IT.

00:43:17.594 --> 00:43:21.298
AND EFFECTIVELY BEING ABLE -- TO

00:43:21.365 --> 00:43:24.601
DO INFERENCES AND REASONING OVER

00:43:24.668 --> 00:43:26.203
LARGE COLLECTION OF TEXT WITHOUT

00:43:26.270 --> 00:43:27.938
REQUIRING YOU TO ACTUALLY READ

00:43:28.005 --> 00:43:31.008
IT -- THAT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT

00:43:31.075 --> 00:43:33.477
CAN TRANSFORM RADIUS FOR YOUTH

00:43:33.544 --> 00:43:36.280
AND THAT'S THAT'S KIND OF WHAT

00:43:36.347 --> 00:43:39.350
I'M MOST EXCITED [inaudible]

00:43:39.416 --> 00:43:41.452
THANK YOU [inaudible]

00:43:41.518 --> 00:43:43.520
SIR BORDERS [inaudible]

00:43:43.587 --> 00:43:46.090
THANK CHAIRMAN.

00:43:46.156 --> 00:43:47.591
LOOK AT YOUR YOUR SLIDE THERE

00:43:47.658 --> 00:43:51.562
AND IT SAYS.

00:43:51.628 --> 00:43:54.231
ON THE THIRD BULLET -- RATHER

00:43:54.298 --> 00:43:56.100
THE THE SECOND.

00:43:56.166 --> 00:43:56.734
ONE THE MORE EXAMPLES YOU GIVE

00:43:56.800 --> 00:43:58.135
THE BETTER A CAT'S.

00:43:58.202 --> 00:43:59.737
SO MY QUESTION TO YOU IS ARE WE

00:43:59.803 --> 00:44:01.171
IN A SITUATION STILL OR IS IT

00:44:01.238 --> 00:44:02.639
CHANGING DRAMATICALLY WHERE.

00:44:02.706 --> 00:44:04.108
INPUT.

00:44:04.174 --> 00:44:08.812
IS -- BY DESIGN AS OPPOSED TO

00:44:08.879 --> 00:44:10.047
THE MACHINE'S ABILITY OR THE

00:44:10.114 --> 00:44:13.117
PLATFORM SOFTWARE'S ABILITY. TO

00:44:13.183 --> 00:44:16.887
ACCESS -- WORLD PLATFORMS IN

00:44:16.954 --> 00:44:20.624
INFORMATION -- NETWORKS ON ITS

00:44:20.691 --> 00:44:24.928
OWN. TO CREATE ITS OWN INPUT.

00:44:24.995 --> 00:44:27.731
OKAY -- YEAH SO WE ARE NOT IN

00:44:27.798 --> 00:44:30.534
THE SECOND STAGE AT ALL -- SO

00:44:30.601 --> 00:44:33.003
THE QUALITY OF WHAT WE HAVE

00:44:33.070 --> 00:44:35.305
RIGHT NOW IS.

00:44:35.372 --> 00:44:36.006
IN THE UNIVERSE FROM WHICH IT

00:44:36.073 --> 00:44:37.274
WILL.

00:44:37.341 --> 00:44:38.709
ANALYZE THE INFORMATION IN AND

00:44:38.776 --> 00:44:41.378
PRODUCE AN OUTCOME YES.

00:44:41.445 --> 00:44:42.513
YES AND I THINK THAT'S A VERY

00:44:42.579 --> 00:44:46.016
IMPORTANT STEP -- IT MADE ME

00:44:46.083 --> 00:44:46.583
THINK ABOUT REGULATION AND

00:44:46.650 --> 00:44:47.985
THINGS THAT I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT

00:44:48.052 --> 00:44:50.487
IS WHAT SET OF EXAMPLES IS BEING

00:44:50.554 --> 00:44:51.722
GIVEN TO THE MACHINE LEARNING

00:44:51.789 --> 00:44:52.856
ALGORITHM.

00:44:52.923 --> 00:44:53.924
WE SHOULD BE WELL AWARE OF FOR

00:44:53.991 --> 00:44:55.192
IT AND THAT SHOULD BE SOMETHING

00:44:55.259 --> 00:44:57.261
THAT IS.

00:44:57.327 --> 00:44:59.163
WHAT WE CONTROL SO IF WE'RE

00:44:59.229 --> 00:45:00.264
LOOKING AT?

00:45:00.330 --> 00:45:04.068
OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD -- WITH.

00:45:04.134 --> 00:45:06.136
SMART CITIES FOR EXAMPLE.

00:45:06.203 --> 00:45:09.206
AND CREATING OUT OF NOTHING --

00:45:09.273 --> 00:45:10.707
ENVIRONMENTS CONTROLLED

00:45:10.774 --> 00:45:13.077
ENVIRONMENTS WHERE AUTOMOBILES

00:45:13.143 --> 00:45:15.079
CAN BE STUDIED -- THE

00:45:15.145 --> 00:45:17.681
ENVIRONMENT -- IS RESTRAINED FOR

00:45:17.748 --> 00:45:19.616
MAXIMUM LEARNING -- SO WANTED SO

00:45:19.683 --> 00:45:20.717
FORTH.

00:45:20.784 --> 00:45:22.519
THAT IS IS THAT WOULD YOU SAY

00:45:22.586 --> 00:45:24.721
THAT IS JUST SIMPLY A TEMPLATE

00:45:24.788 --> 00:45:27.791
FOR LEARNING THAT AT SOME POINT

00:45:27.858 --> 00:45:29.093
IT WILL GRADUATE BEYOND.

00:45:29.159 --> 00:45:31.728
THAT INPUT PHASE THAT MANUAL

00:45:31.795 --> 00:45:34.331
INPUT PHASE INTO ITS OWN

00:45:34.398 --> 00:45:37.234
CAPACITY TO REACH OUT INTO --

00:45:37.301 --> 00:45:39.436
THE INFORMATION NETWORKS.

00:45:39.503 --> 00:45:41.805
SO ON THE REACHING OUT INTO

00:45:41.872 --> 00:45:44.608
INFORMATION NETWORKS -- FIRST AS

00:45:44.675 --> 00:45:48.011
A QUESTION OFF DO WE FEEL THAT

00:45:48.078 --> 00:45:49.480
THAT'S FEATURED THAT IS

00:45:49.546 --> 00:45:51.548
BENEFICIAL AT ALL FOR MACHINE

00:45:51.615 --> 00:45:52.850
LEARNING ALGORITHMS TO HALF THE

00:45:52.916 --> 00:45:54.885
PURELY PRAGMATICALLY.

00:45:54.952 --> 00:45:56.253
IS THIS SOMETHING THAT.

00:45:56.320 --> 00:45:58.188
LAKE.

00:45:58.255 --> 00:45:59.356
IT WOULD BE READING THAT MACHINE

00:45:59.423 --> 00:46:00.491
LEARNING ALGORITHMS WOULD BE

00:46:00.557 --> 00:46:01.225
BETTER AT IF THEY WERE TO DO

00:46:01.291 --> 00:46:02.793
THAT OR NOT AND SO THAT'S ONE

00:46:02.860 --> 00:46:04.094
QUESTION.

00:46:04.161 --> 00:46:06.463
THE SECOND QUESTION IS WHETHER --

00:46:06.530 --> 00:46:08.765
THE EFFORT OFF US BEING THE

00:46:08.832 --> 00:46:10.134
GATEKEEPERS TO WHAT DATA IT HAS

00:46:10.200 --> 00:46:11.535
ACCESS TO IS SOMETHING THAT'S

00:46:11.602 --> 00:46:14.204
PROHIBITIVE IN TERMS OF COST AND

00:46:14.271 --> 00:46:16.073
SO FAR THAT'S NOT THE PROBLEM

00:46:16.140 --> 00:46:18.208
THE PROBLEM IS IT'S NOT THAT IS

00:46:18.275 --> 00:46:20.344
NOT A PROBLEM NOW.

00:46:20.410 --> 00:46:23.280
SO GET KEEPING OUR HAVING DATA

00:46:23.347 --> 00:46:24.581
IN A WAY THAT MACHINE LEARNING

00:46:24.648 --> 00:46:27.017
MODELS AND MODELS CAN INGEST IS

00:46:27.084 --> 00:46:30.120
NOT THE THE PROHIBITIVE PART OF

00:46:30.187 --> 00:46:31.188
THE BY.

00:46:31.255 --> 00:46:32.856
SO IN TERMS OF MEDICAL HISTORY.

00:46:32.923 --> 00:46:34.691
WE TALKED ABOUT MAKING MEDICAL

00:46:34.758 --> 00:46:36.560
HISTORY AVAILABLE.

00:46:36.627 --> 00:46:40.697
ONLINE AND PATIENT RIGHT RATHER

00:46:40.764 --> 00:46:41.965
THAN IT BEING IN PAPER FORM.

00:46:42.032 --> 00:46:43.667
IS THAT AN EXAMPLE THAT THE MORE

00:46:43.734 --> 00:46:45.102
YOU CONCENTRATE.

00:46:45.169 --> 00:46:46.637
MEDICAL HISTORY.

00:46:46.703 --> 00:46:48.572
THEN YOU HAVE A UNIVERSE THAT

00:46:48.639 --> 00:46:50.207
CAN CREATE INPUTS.

00:46:50.274 --> 00:46:51.508
AND FROM THAT.

00:46:51.575 --> 00:46:54.845
ON THAT UNIVERSE -- THEN WE CAN

00:46:54.912 --> 00:46:56.480
HAVE A AYE OUTPUTS. FOR

00:46:56.547 --> 00:47:00.584
DIAGNOSIS AND STUFF LIKE THAT --

00:47:00.651 --> 00:47:01.752
YES SO TO THAT WOULD BE AN

00:47:01.818 --> 00:47:04.321
EXAMPLE WHERE YOU WOULD CREATE

00:47:04.388 --> 00:47:08.625
THE UNIVERSE THAT THE A LIVES.

00:47:08.692 --> 00:47:10.160
THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT IT SHOULD

00:47:10.227 --> 00:47:11.428
STILL HAVE ACCESS TO ANY

00:47:11.495 --> 00:47:14.231
INFORMATION NETWORKS OUTSIDE OF

00:47:14.298 --> 00:47:16.667
THE THE COLLECTION OF THE

00:47:16.733 --> 00:47:19.269
PATIENT HAD TO COURTS.

00:47:19.336 --> 00:47:21.672
YEAH RIGHT YEAH AND AND SO SO

00:47:21.738 --> 00:47:23.874
FAR THE DATA IS READY.

00:47:23.941 --> 00:47:24.708
SORT OF P. FORMATTED WHEN IT'S

00:47:24.775 --> 00:47:26.443
GIVEN TO MACHINE LEARNING SYSTEM

00:47:26.510 --> 00:47:27.511
THAT ARE SORT OF PIPELINES THAT

00:47:27.578 --> 00:47:29.446
SORT OF THE DATA GOES THROUGH.

00:47:29.513 --> 00:47:32.082
AND THERE IS VERY LITTLE OKAY IF

00:47:32.149 --> 00:47:33.984
ANY THAT OPPORTUNITY GOES OUT TO

00:47:34.051 --> 00:47:38.889
THE INTERNET AND TRIES -- TO

00:47:38.956 --> 00:47:40.057
PRESS -- TWO DO THINGS WITH IT.

00:47:40.123 --> 00:47:41.225
AT THE MOST PROMINENT EXAMPLE I

00:47:41.291 --> 00:47:42.192
CAN THINK OFF WHICH IS SOMEWHAT

00:47:42.259 --> 00:47:45.262
RELATED IS THIS MICROSOFT THE

00:47:45.329 --> 00:47:46.964
EIGHTY CHAD PART WHICH CAME A

00:47:47.030 --> 00:47:47.364
COUPLE YEARS AGO.

00:47:47.431 --> 00:47:49.066
WHERE WHAT THEY DID WAS IT WAS

00:47:49.132 --> 00:47:51.034
JUST A JOB PORTAL OF THING WHICH

00:47:51.101 --> 00:47:53.136
IS LIKE A TWITTER ACCOUNT?

00:47:53.203 --> 00:47:54.271
THANK YOU CAN CONVERSE WITH.

00:47:54.338 --> 00:47:56.340
AND INSTEAD OF JUST CONVERSING

00:47:56.406 --> 00:47:57.874
IT HAD THIS MODE OF BEING ABLE

00:47:57.941 --> 00:47:59.710
TO LEARN FROM WHAT THE PEOPLE

00:47:59.776 --> 00:48:00.244
WERE.

00:48:00.310 --> 00:48:02.646
TALKING TO IT AND SO IN THAT

00:48:02.713 --> 00:48:03.113
SENSE.

00:48:03.180 --> 00:48:05.148
OF PEOPLE'S QUICKLY FIGURED OUT

00:48:05.215 --> 00:48:06.416
THAT IF THERE WAS CERTAIN WAYS

00:48:06.483 --> 00:48:08.986
THAT YOU TALK TO THE AGENT --

00:48:09.052 --> 00:48:10.387
YOU COULD GET IT TO REPRODUCE

00:48:10.454 --> 00:48:12.389
WHAT DO YOU SAY.

00:48:12.456 --> 00:48:14.825
TO THE THE CHART PART -- AND

00:48:14.891 --> 00:48:16.760
THEN CLEARLY WHEN YOU DO THAT ON

00:48:16.827 --> 00:48:18.462
THE INTERNET THE JOB BOARD

00:48:18.528 --> 00:48:21.999
RESULTED IN SORT OF SORT OF

00:48:22.065 --> 00:48:24.234
LANGUAGE THAT MICROSOFT WASN'T

00:48:24.301 --> 00:48:25.636
PROUD OFF SPACES.

00:48:25.702 --> 00:48:26.737
AND I'M THEY SHUT IT DOWN AND

00:48:26.803 --> 00:48:29.339
EVERYTHING SO -- ANY EXPERIENCE

00:48:29.406 --> 00:48:30.874
HAS SHOWN THAT IF YOU SORT OF

00:48:30.941 --> 00:48:33.744
DON'T CONTROL WHAT DATA CLOSING

00:48:33.810 --> 00:48:35.279
THINGS CAN GO HERE FOR A WIRE

00:48:35.345 --> 00:48:38.081
PRETTY QUICKLY -- PARTLY BECAUSE

00:48:38.148 --> 00:48:39.883
OF THE SORT OF EXAMPLES AND

00:48:39.950 --> 00:48:41.752
GIVING YOU EVEN IF YOU DO GIVE

00:48:41.818 --> 00:48:44.121
IT CLEAN DATA THAT OUR PATENTS

00:48:44.187 --> 00:48:44.721
IT CAN FIND.

00:48:44.788 --> 00:48:47.157
OF WHEN YOU LET IT GO OUT ON THE

00:48:47.224 --> 00:48:47.858
INTERNET YOU HAVE NO CONTROL

00:48:47.924 --> 00:48:55.532
OVER.

00:48:55.599 --> 00:48:57.634
WHAT THE HUSKY EXAMPLE?

00:48:57.701 --> 00:48:58.368
IF YOU WERE PROGRAM THAT AGAIN

00:48:58.435 --> 00:49:00.370
NOW KNOWING THAT YOU SAW THAT IT

00:49:00.437 --> 00:49:02.306
PICKED UP ON SNOW.

00:49:02.372 --> 00:49:03.473
YOUR NEXT.

00:49:03.540 --> 00:49:04.374
YOU KNOW YOU'RE YOU'RE NEXT TO

00:49:04.441 --> 00:49:05.575
PIECE OF INTELLIGENCE THAT

00:49:05.642 --> 00:49:06.410
YOU'RE GONNA PUT INTO THE SYSTEM.

00:49:06.476 --> 00:49:09.146
IS DO NOT LOOK AT EXTERNALITIES.

00:49:09.212 --> 00:49:12.382
ONLY LOOK AT THE PRINCIPLE.

00:49:12.449 --> 00:49:16.153
THAT IS YES -- BUT THAT'S EASIER

00:49:16.219 --> 00:49:17.054
SAID THAN DONE YEAH LIKE MAYBE

00:49:17.120 --> 00:49:18.021
WILL TAKE CARE OF THE SNOW BUT

00:49:18.088 --> 00:49:19.022
MAYBE TO PICK UP ON SOMETHING

00:49:19.089 --> 00:49:21.258
ELSE THAT BE DID IN TWO DAYS

00:49:21.325 --> 00:49:22.859
STRAIGHT -- MAYBE TO SOME OTHER

00:49:22.926 --> 00:49:24.995
BUTTON AND THE IN THE IMAGE THAT

00:49:25.062 --> 00:49:28.699
YOU KNOW MAYBE THOSE SKY COLOR

00:49:28.765 --> 00:49:33.937
CODED -- YEAH AND YOU KNOW WHAT

00:49:34.004 --> 00:49:34.538
IS PRIMARY WHAT IS BACKED OFF

00:49:34.604 --> 00:49:39.776
AND WELL THANK YOU OF TAXING AND

00:49:39.843 --> 00:49:41.311
AS SOME OF YOU KNOW -- YOU SEE I

DR CHARLES GOING TO TELL US

00:50:49.880 --> 00:50:50.981
ABOUT SOME OF THE EXCITING

00:50:51.047 --> 00:50:52.249
THINGS INDUSTRY LEADERS LEADERS

00:50:52.315 --> 00:50:53.884
ARE DOING IN THE FIELD OF

00:50:53.950 --> 00:50:55.352
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE.

00:50:55.419 --> 00:50:57.254
SOME OF CHALLENGES FACING A AYE

00:50:57.320 --> 00:50:58.622
IN THE INDUSTRY BEHIND IT IN AND

00:50:58.688 --> 00:51:00.257
I'LL ASK YOU THE SAME QUESTIONS

00:51:00.323 --> 00:51:01.024
I ASKED.

00:51:01.091 --> 00:51:02.826
OF DOCTOR SAYING ABOUT AT THE

00:51:02.893 --> 00:51:04.594
END ABOUT WHAT YOU MOST EXCITED

00:51:04.661 --> 00:51:05.228
ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE MOST CONCERNED

00:51:05.295 --> 00:51:07.631
ABOUT IN IN YOU SHOULD BEAR IN

00:51:07.697 --> 00:51:08.365
MIND.

00:51:08.432 --> 00:51:10.734
OF THAT TO TARGET TO LAWYERS SO

00:51:10.801 --> 00:51:11.868
LEASE THAT SUITS HERE IN THE

00:51:11.935 --> 00:51:13.136
ROOM RIGHT NOW.

00:51:13.203 --> 00:51:14.871
SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH DOCTOR

00:51:14.938 --> 00:51:16.072
CHAO WE APPRECIATE YOU BEING

00:51:16.139 --> 00:51:18.108
HERE SOUNDS GREAT AND THANKS

00:51:18.175 --> 00:51:19.443
MISTER CHAIRMAN SENATOR GLAD TO

00:51:19.509 --> 00:51:20.477
BE HERE WITH YOU.

00:51:20.544 --> 00:51:21.845
I'M GONNA TALK A LITTLE BIT

00:51:21.912 --> 00:51:23.113
TODAY ABOUT A AYE AYE FROM A

00:51:23.180 --> 00:51:24.614
GOOGLE PERSPECTIVE HOW WE'VE

00:51:24.681 --> 00:51:26.183
BEEN LOOKING AT IT FROM THE

00:51:26.249 --> 00:51:27.117
COMPANY.

00:51:27.184 --> 00:51:29.186
I'M DOCTOR SEEING WENT OVER A

00:51:29.252 --> 00:51:30.620
LOT OF THE ORIGINAL AND KIND OF

00:51:30.687 --> 00:51:32.355
THE BASICS OF HOW THE TECHNOLOGY

00:51:32.422 --> 00:51:34.324
WORKS IF YOU LOOK AT THIS FIRST

00:51:34.391 --> 00:51:35.725
SLIDE HERE YOU CAN SEE.

00:51:35.792 --> 00:51:36.860
ON OUR DEFINITION THAT THE

00:51:36.927 --> 00:51:38.962
COMPANY ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE

00:51:39.029 --> 00:51:40.997
IS JUST THIS LARGER SENSE OF THE

00:51:41.064 --> 00:51:43.166
SCIENCE OF MAKING THINGS SMART

00:51:43.233 --> 00:51:44.134
YOU COULD IMAGINE YOU COULD

00:51:44.201 --> 00:51:45.669
PROGRAM A COMPUTER RIGHT WITH

00:51:45.735 --> 00:51:46.937
THE DICTIONARY YOUR CALCULATOR

00:51:47.003 --> 00:51:48.038
ENCYCLOPEDIA.

00:51:48.104 --> 00:51:49.906
THAT COULD BE CONSIDERED SMART

00:51:49.973 --> 00:51:51.508
WITHIN NOT AND WE SEE A SUBSET

00:51:51.575 --> 00:51:52.776
THAT WE ARE CALLING MACHINE

00:51:52.843 --> 00:51:54.344
LEARNING ITS TECHNIQUES TO LEARN

00:51:54.411 --> 00:51:56.246
FROM DATA SO INSTEAD OF BEING

00:51:56.313 --> 00:51:58.281
HAND PROGRAM IT'S AS DR SINGH

00:51:58.348 --> 00:52:00.283
SAID TEACHING COMPUTERS TO LEARN

00:52:00.350 --> 00:52:02.352
FROM EXAMPLES -- YOU KNOW TO BE

00:52:02.419 --> 00:52:03.820
ABLE TO DISTINGUISH THINGS LIKE

00:52:03.887 --> 00:52:10.594
WOLF AND HUSKY AND MANY OTHER

00:52:10.660 --> 00:52:11.361
DIFFERENT.

00:52:11.428 --> 00:52:12.395
THE REASON THIS IS BEEN SO

00:52:12.462 --> 00:52:14.197
IMPORTANT TO US ACT GOOGLE IS

00:52:14.264 --> 00:52:15.232
FOR THE REASON ON THE NEXT SLIDE

00:52:15.298 --> 00:52:16.466
MACHINE LEARNING SKILLS BETTER

00:52:16.533 --> 00:52:16.967
THAN RULE BASED CODE.

00:52:17.033 --> 00:52:19.069
IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE FLAGSHIP

00:52:19.135 --> 00:52:20.470
GOOGLE PRODUCT GOOGLE SEARCH AYE

00:52:20.537 --> 00:52:23.273
IT'S CHANGED A LOT IN THE LAST

00:52:23.340 --> 00:52:23.740
FIFTEEN TWENTY YEARS.

00:52:23.807 --> 00:52:25.542
IF YOU DID A SEARCH LET'S SAY

00:52:25.609 --> 00:52:26.977
FIFTEEN YEARS AGO PEOPLE USED TO

00:52:27.043 --> 00:52:28.979
SEARCH FOR THINGS LIKE WATER OR

00:52:29.045 --> 00:52:29.513
COFFEE.

00:52:29.579 --> 00:52:31.515
AND AND YOU KNOW YOU WOULD GET A

00:52:31.581 --> 00:52:33.450
RESULTS I'M TEN BLUE LINKS A LOT

00:52:33.517 --> 00:52:35.218
OF THAT WAS HAND CODED --

00:52:35.285 --> 00:52:37.254
PROGRAMS BEHIND THE RESULTS

00:52:37.320 --> 00:52:39.422
RIGHT SO IF USER SEARCHES FOR

00:52:39.489 --> 00:52:41.091
WATER THEN SHOW THESE TYPES OF

00:52:41.157 --> 00:52:43.293
WEEKS RIGHT IF USER SEARCHES FOR

00:52:43.360 --> 00:52:43.894
COFFEE ENSURE THESE TYPES OF

00:52:43.960 --> 00:52:46.663
THINGS THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE TODAY.

00:52:46.730 --> 00:52:48.398
AND PEOPLE ARE SEARCHING IT IN

00:52:48.465 --> 00:52:50.200
MANY MORE LANGUAGES THAN ENGLISH

00:52:50.267 --> 00:52:51.968
FOR EXAMPLE SO TO HAND PROGRAM

00:52:52.035 --> 00:52:53.470
THINGS IN HUNDREDS OF LANGUAGES

00:52:53.537 --> 00:52:54.905
WOULD BE HUNDREDS OF TIMES MORE

00:52:54.971 --> 00:52:57.374
WORK -- PEOPLE ARE ALSO

00:52:57.440 --> 00:52:59.109
SEARCHING FOR A LOT HARDER

00:52:59.175 --> 00:53:00.610
QUESTIONS THEY'RE NO LONGER JUST

00:53:00.677 --> 00:53:02.045
SEARCHING FOR COFFEE THEY'RE

00:53:02.112 --> 00:53:03.613
SEARCHING FOR COFFEE SHOP NEAR

00:53:03.680 --> 00:53:05.749
ME RATED MORE THAN FOUR STARS

00:53:05.815 --> 00:53:09.185
GOOD VIBE.

00:53:09.252 --> 00:53:10.854
YOU COULD NEVER ACTUALLY.

00:53:10.921 --> 00:53:12.422
AND PROGRAM ALL OF THOSE TYPES

00:53:12.489 --> 00:53:13.290
OF ANSWERS INTO SEARCH ENGINE

00:53:13.356 --> 00:53:15.492
AND IN FACT TODAY MORE THAN 15%

00:53:15.559 --> 00:53:17.394
OF SEARCHES EVERY SINGLE DAY OUR

00:53:17.460 --> 00:53:18.695
UNIQUE THEIR COMPLETELY NEW

00:53:18.762 --> 00:53:20.463
GOOGLE'S NEVER SEEN BEFORE SO WE

00:53:20.530 --> 00:53:22.432
WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO USE.

00:53:22.499 --> 00:53:24.267
PREVIOUS METHODS OF HAND CODING --

00:53:24.334 --> 00:53:25.402
THE THIRD PIECE WHICH IS

00:53:25.468 --> 00:53:26.703
INTERESTING IS THE INTERNET

00:53:26.770 --> 00:53:29.039
TODAY IS NO LONGER JUST TEXT A

00:53:29.105 --> 00:53:30.240
LOT OF IT IS.

00:53:30.307 --> 00:53:33.810
AND VIDEO IMAGES SOUNDS MUSIC

00:53:33.877 --> 00:53:35.712
AND AUDIO OTHER THINGS LIKE THAT

00:53:35.779 --> 00:53:38.148
SO AGAIN WE HAVE TO MOVE TO

00:53:38.214 --> 00:53:39.716
MACHINE LEARNING AS A COMPANY IT

00:53:39.783 --> 00:53:40.951
SCALES BETTER THAN RULE BASED

00:53:41.017 --> 00:53:42.385
CODE HELPS US TO DR ALL THE

00:53:42.452 --> 00:53:44.654
DIFFERENT KINDS OF THINGS USERS

00:53:44.721 --> 00:53:45.322
ARE LOOKING.

00:53:45.388 --> 00:53:46.690
FOR ON THE NEXT PAGE YOU'LL SEE

00:53:46.756 --> 00:53:48.658
A FEW DIFFERENT EXAMPLES OF HOW

00:53:48.725 --> 00:53:49.759
PEOPLE ARE USING MACHINE

00:53:49.826 --> 00:53:51.061
LEARNING AGAIN DOCTOR SEEING

00:53:51.127 --> 00:53:53.096
REFERRED TO YOU I'M THIS IDEA OF

00:53:53.163 --> 00:53:54.364
COMPUTATION.

00:53:54.431 --> 00:53:55.932
ON THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT

00:53:55.999 --> 00:53:57.400
TYPES OF MATHEMATICAL MODELS

00:53:57.467 --> 00:53:58.868
LIKE SOME RICE TO COUPLE HERE

00:53:58.935 --> 00:54:00.337
ALGORITHMS TO CIRCLE MODELS AND

00:54:00.403 --> 00:54:01.438
THEN ONE OF THE MOST COMMON

00:54:01.504 --> 00:54:02.939
WHICH YOU MAY HAVE BEEN HEARING

00:54:03.006 --> 00:54:04.341
INCREASING ABOUT IT'S CALLED

00:54:04.407 --> 00:54:07.811
NEURAL NETS -- NEURAL NETS LEARN

00:54:07.877 --> 00:54:09.112
FROM EXAMPLES.

00:54:09.179 --> 00:54:10.113
IF YOU GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE

00:54:10.180 --> 00:54:11.381
AGAIN SIMILAR TO WHAT DOCTOR

00:54:11.448 --> 00:54:13.516
SING TALKED ABOUT YOU CAN TRAIN

00:54:13.583 --> 00:54:16.119
NEURAL NETS TO LEARN FROM MANY

00:54:16.186 --> 00:54:17.220
MANY DIFFERENT EXAMPLES.

00:54:17.287 --> 00:54:18.655
I'M IN EACH OF THE CIRCLES THAT

00:54:18.722 --> 00:54:20.357
YOU SEE HERE ON THE SLIDES

00:54:20.423 --> 00:54:21.758
REPRESENT ONE MATHEMATICAL

00:54:21.825 --> 00:54:23.159
OPERATIONS SO COULD BE SOMETHING

00:54:23.226 --> 00:54:25.261
LIKE AT FIVE OR DIVIDE BY THREE

00:54:25.328 --> 00:54:26.396
YOUR TAKE A DERIVATIVE.

00:54:26.463 --> 00:54:28.598
I'M CENTURY YOU'VE GOT INPUTS TO

00:54:28.665 --> 00:54:29.566
LEARN FROM ON THE LEFT SIDE

00:54:29.633 --> 00:54:30.834
YOU'VE GOT AN IMAGE OF A CAT

00:54:30.900 --> 00:54:32.435
IT'S LABELED CAT YOU KNOW WHAT

00:54:32.502 --> 00:54:33.670
THE OUTPUT IS IT YOU WANT AN

00:54:33.737 --> 00:54:34.304
OUTSIDE.

00:54:34.371 --> 00:54:36.673
YOU CAN CONSTRAIN MODEL TO TRY

00:54:36.740 --> 00:54:37.941
TO KEEP UPDATING WHAT THOSE

00:54:38.008 --> 00:54:39.909
MATHEMATICAL OPERATIONS ARE SO

00:54:39.976 --> 00:54:41.778
THAT IT CAN ALSO PROPERLY FIT

00:54:41.845 --> 00:54:43.046
DOG IN CAR APPLE.

00:54:43.113 --> 00:54:44.581
ON FLOWER YOU CAN GO THROUGH

00:54:44.648 --> 00:54:46.883
MILLIONS OF THESE EXAMPLES AND

00:54:46.950 --> 00:54:48.284
THEN WHEN YOU SHOW THE AND

00:54:48.351 --> 00:54:49.886
MACHINE LEARNING MODEL SOME NEW

00:54:49.953 --> 00:54:51.221
IMAGE HASN'T SEEN BEFORE

00:54:51.287 --> 00:54:52.722
HOPEFULLY ALL OF THE OPERATIONS

00:54:52.789 --> 00:54:54.424
HAVE BEEN CONFIGURED SUCH THAT

00:54:54.491 --> 00:54:55.425
YOU GET THE CORRECT OUTPUT ON

00:54:55.492 --> 00:54:56.026
THE END.

00:54:56.092 --> 00:54:57.627
IF NOT YOU GO BACK AND TRY TO

00:54:57.694 --> 00:55:01.931
EXAMINE WHAT NEEDS TO BE

00:55:01.998 --> 00:55:03.700
IMPROVED INTRIGUED.

00:55:03.767 --> 00:55:04.300
I'M FROM OUR POINT OF VIEW IT

00:55:04.367 --> 00:55:05.035
GOOGLE MACHINE LEARNING REALLY

00:55:05.101 --> 00:55:06.970
REQUIRES FOUR INGREDIENTS ONE OF

00:55:07.037 --> 00:55:08.638
THEM THE MOST OBVIOUS AGAIN DR

00:55:08.705 --> 00:55:09.906
SINGH TALKED ABOUT THIS IS

00:55:09.973 --> 00:55:11.641
TRAINING EXAMPLES SO YOU KNOW

00:55:11.708 --> 00:55:13.443
IMAGES WHICH HAVE LABELS LIKE

00:55:13.510 --> 00:55:14.811
CATS THIS IS WHAT A LOT OF

00:55:14.878 --> 00:55:16.146
PEOPLE WOULD CALL DATA.

00:55:16.212 --> 00:55:18.515
HOWEVER THAT IS NOT THE ONLY

00:55:18.581 --> 00:55:20.617
THING THAT'S NEEDED FOR MACHINE

00:55:20.684 --> 00:55:21.651
LEARNING IT'S JUST ONE OF THE

00:55:21.718 --> 00:55:22.752
FOUR SO ON THE RIGHT YOU'LL SEE

00:55:22.819 --> 00:55:24.320
ALGORITHMS AND TOOLS SO WHAT

00:55:24.387 --> 00:55:25.422
THOSE MATHEMATICAL MODELS LOOK

00:55:25.488 --> 00:55:27.123
LIKE ALMOST JUST AS IMPORTANT IF

00:55:27.190 --> 00:55:28.358
NOT MORE IMPORTANT THAN HAVING

00:55:28.425 --> 00:55:29.059
THE DATA.

00:55:29.125 --> 00:55:30.960
YOU'VE GOT TO BE ABLE TO HAVE

00:55:31.027 --> 00:55:32.228
THE TOOLS TO LEARN FROM THE DATA.

00:55:32.295 --> 00:55:33.329
I'M ON THE BOTTOM LEFT YOU'LL

00:55:33.396 --> 00:55:35.765
SEE COMPUTATIONAL RESOURCES AT

00:55:35.832 --> 00:55:37.634
THIS HAS REALLY IMPROVED OVER

00:55:37.701 --> 00:55:40.270
THE LAST -- ESPECIALLY A FEW

00:55:40.336 --> 00:55:42.305
YEARS BUT OVER THE LAST DECADE

00:55:42.372 --> 00:55:44.441
AND THESE ARE COMPUTER CHIPS YOU

00:55:44.507 --> 00:55:45.709
KNOW YOU MAY BECOME FAMILIAR

00:55:45.775 --> 00:55:48.311
WITH CPUS OR GPUS NOW THERE'S A

00:55:48.378 --> 00:55:49.746
LOT OF COMPANIES WORKING TO MAKE.

00:55:49.813 --> 00:55:51.614
NEW NEXT GENERATION COMPUTER

00:55:51.681 --> 00:55:53.216
CHIPS THAT CAN SPECIFICALLY

00:55:53.283 --> 00:55:55.518
PROCESS THE MATH THAT'S NEEDED

00:55:55.585 --> 00:55:56.753
FOR NEURAL NETS SO NEURAL NETS

00:55:56.820 --> 00:55:57.854
USE A LOT OF MATRIX

00:55:57.921 --> 00:55:59.622
MULTIPLICATION THAT'S EXPENSIVE

00:55:59.689 --> 00:56:01.224
AND THAT TAKES A LONG TIME ON

00:56:01.291 --> 00:56:02.726
CPUS AND GPUS.

00:56:02.792 --> 00:56:03.927
ON THERE'S A LOT OF WORK GOING

00:56:03.993 --> 00:56:05.595
ON AT GOOGLE AND OTHER PLACES TO

00:56:05.662 --> 00:56:06.863
MAKE CHIPS THAT CAN HANDLE

00:56:06.930 --> 00:56:08.598
SPECIFICALLY THAT TYPE OF

00:56:08.665 --> 00:56:09.632
NOTHING BE VERY EFFICIENT

00:56:09.699 --> 00:56:10.166
THOUGHT IT.

00:56:10.233 --> 00:56:11.835
I'M WHICH IS NOW ENABLING HUGE

00:56:11.901 --> 00:56:13.737
GROWTHIN MACHINE LEARNING --

00:56:13.803 --> 00:56:17.941
THE LAST PIECE HERE'S CREATIVITY

00:56:18.007 --> 00:56:19.442
AND INGENUITY.

00:56:19.509 --> 00:56:20.677
SENATOR BORDERS YOU TOUCHED A

00:56:20.744 --> 00:56:21.511
LITTLE BIT ON THIS BUT BEHIND

00:56:21.578 --> 00:56:22.712
ANY MODEL YOU REALLY DO NEED THE

00:56:22.779 --> 00:56:23.513
EVEN THAT ARE DESIGNING WHAT

00:56:23.580 --> 00:56:24.881
EXACTLY DOES THIS MODEL DO YOU

00:56:24.948 --> 00:56:26.282
HOW DOES IT PERFORM WHAT ARE THE

00:56:26.349 --> 00:56:28.051
INTERESTING WAYS.

00:56:28.118 --> 00:56:29.652
ON THAT IT CAN LEARN.

00:56:29.719 --> 00:56:30.920
AND SO TALENT IS ABSOLUTELY

00:56:30.987 --> 00:56:33.323
CRUCIAL TO BEING ABLE TO DEVELOP

00:56:33.389 --> 00:56:35.492
MACHINE LEARNING TECHNOLOGY.

00:56:35.558 --> 00:56:36.960
AGAIN FROM GOOGLE PERSPECTIVE A

00:56:37.026 --> 00:56:39.129
I IS USED ACROSS GOOGLE PRODUCTS

00:56:39.195 --> 00:56:41.131
SO I JUST LISTED FIFTEEN YEAR

00:56:41.197 --> 00:56:42.966
AND THERE ARE SO MANY DIFFERENT

00:56:43.032 --> 00:56:44.400
WAYS THAT WE'RE USING MACHINE

00:56:44.467 --> 00:56:45.835
LEARNING IN ALL OF THESE

00:56:45.902 --> 00:56:47.403
PRODUCTS TALKED ABOUT SEARCH.

00:56:47.470 --> 00:56:48.772
BUT WE COULD GO INTO ANY OF

00:56:48.838 --> 00:56:50.540
THESE IN DETAILS REALLY

00:56:50.607 --> 00:56:52.575
TRANSFORMING OUR ABILITY. TO

00:56:52.642 --> 00:56:54.744
CREATE NEW THINGS DESIGN NEW

00:56:54.811 --> 00:56:59.349
FEATURES WELL EVEN THOUGH WE

00:56:59.415 --> 00:57:00.550
THINK WORKS ON A LOT OF

00:57:00.617 --> 00:57:01.651
IMPORTANT PROBLEMS IT'S REALLY

00:57:01.718 --> 00:57:02.986
ONLY A FRACTION OF THE PROBLEMS

00:57:03.052 --> 00:57:05.155
THAT EXIST IN THE WORLD SO THERE

00:57:05.221 --> 00:57:05.755
ARE.

00:57:05.822 --> 00:57:07.023
MANY DIFFERENT.

00:57:07.090 --> 00:57:08.491
OPENS THAT LOTS OF PEOPLE CARE

00:57:08.558 --> 00:57:10.126
ABOUT IN THE WORLD AND WE'RE

00:57:10.193 --> 00:57:11.427
ACTUALLY STARTING TO SEE THE USE

00:57:11.494 --> 00:57:12.662
OF A I AND MACHINE LEARNING TO

00:57:12.729 --> 00:57:15.865
ADDRESS A LOT OF THOSE PROBLEMS.

00:57:15.932 --> 00:57:17.233
RIGHT SO TOP LEFT YOU'VE GONE

00:57:17.300 --> 00:57:18.601
IMAGE OF AN AYE WE'RE SEEING

00:57:18.668 --> 00:57:20.436
DOCTORS STARTING TO USE MACHINE

00:57:20.503 --> 00:57:22.572
LEARNING FOR DIAGNOSIS ON THIS

00:57:22.639 --> 00:57:24.808
HERE IS A CASE OF DIABETIC

00:57:24.874 --> 00:57:26.109
RETINOPATHY.

00:57:26.176 --> 00:57:27.877
DOCTORS USING IMAGES TO SEE

00:57:27.944 --> 00:57:29.612
WHETHER PATIENT HAS EARLY SIGNS

00:57:29.679 --> 00:57:31.080
OF BLINDNESS THAT COMES WITH

00:57:31.147 --> 00:57:33.082
DIABETES I'M WERE SEEN USE OF

00:57:33.149 --> 00:57:34.918
THIS FOR CANCER HEART DISEASE --

00:57:34.984 --> 00:57:36.553
MEAN DISEASE'S AXE RAISE AND

00:57:36.619 --> 00:57:38.688
MANY OTHER THINGS THE NEXT PHOTO

00:57:38.755 --> 00:57:40.690
WE'VE GOT ON LOTS OF DIFFERENT

00:57:40.757 --> 00:57:43.293
FARMERS AGRICULTURE -- NEW

00:57:43.359 --> 00:57:45.862
COMMUNITIES WITH AT LOOKING BACK

00:57:45.929 --> 00:57:48.164
HOUSE AND CATTLE AND SHEEP AT A

00:57:48.231 --> 00:57:50.200
LOTS OF DIFFERENT -- PLACES IN

00:57:50.266 --> 00:57:51.367
WHICH FARMERS ARE USING MACHINE

00:57:51.434 --> 00:57:52.702
LEARNING TO PREDICT BASS

00:57:52.769 --> 00:57:54.437
CONDITIONS FOR THEIR FARMS

00:57:54.504 --> 00:57:56.339
INCREASE EFFICIENCY I'M INCREASE

00:57:56.406 --> 00:57:57.607
EFFECTIVENESS INCREASE THE

00:57:57.674 --> 00:57:59.442
HEALTH OF THEIR ANIMALS.

00:57:59.509 --> 00:58:00.643
I'M CONSERVATION.

00:58:00.710 --> 00:58:02.779
RAIN FOREST SPACE EXPLORATION

00:58:02.846 --> 00:58:04.180
AND THEN ON THE BOTTOM RIGHT AND

00:58:04.247 --> 00:58:05.748
THIS IS AN EXAMPLE ACTUALLY FROM

00:58:05.815 --> 00:58:07.217
THE STATE OF ILLINOIS SO THEY'RE

00:58:07.283 --> 00:58:08.618
USING MACHINE LEARNING AND TO

00:58:08.685 --> 00:58:10.954
BETTER PREDICT TRAFFIC FLOW AND

00:58:11.020 --> 00:58:13.289
BETTER MONITOR AND BETTER --

00:58:13.356 --> 00:58:14.157
IDENTIFY.

00:58:14.224 --> 00:58:16.025
WAYS TO IMPROVE TRAFFIC ON THEIR

00:58:16.092 --> 00:58:17.660
STREETS THERE'S A LOT OF

00:58:17.727 --> 00:58:19.662
DIFFERENT WAYS THAT HUMAN CAN BE

00:58:19.729 --> 00:58:21.431
USED FOR PUBLIC SERVICES.

00:58:21.497 --> 00:58:23.299
ASSEMBLY MEMBER.

00:58:23.366 --> 00:58:23.900
NUMBER SPOKE TO THIS A LITTLE

00:58:23.967 --> 00:58:24.300
BIT.

00:58:24.367 --> 00:58:26.336
I'M HAPPY TO GO INTO THAT A

00:58:26.402 --> 00:58:29.372
LITTLE BIT MORE IN DETAIL -- YOU

00:58:29.439 --> 00:58:30.273
MENTION THIS CENTER I'M BURKE

00:58:30.340 --> 00:58:31.641
BUT AT YOU KNOW THEY'RE LIKE ANY

00:58:31.708 --> 00:58:33.142
TECHNOLOGY THEY'RE AMAZING

00:58:33.209 --> 00:58:34.043
OPPORTUNITIES THERE ARE ALSO

00:58:34.110 --> 00:58:35.445
RISKS THAT COME WITH THE

00:58:35.511 --> 00:58:36.379
TECHNOLOGY.

00:58:36.446 --> 00:58:37.647
I'M WE'VE EXPERIENCES THAT

00:58:37.714 --> 00:58:39.148
GOOGLE OURSELVES EVEN AS WE'VE

00:58:39.215 --> 00:58:40.783
BEEN DESIGNING YOU KNOW HUNDREDS

00:58:40.850 --> 00:58:42.285
OF NEW FEATURES AND PRODUCTS AND

00:58:42.352 --> 00:58:43.319
ALL THESE OPPORTUNITIES THAT WE

00:58:43.386 --> 00:58:45.088
SEE WE'VE HAD A LOT OF DIFFERENT

00:58:45.154 --> 00:58:46.189
QUESTIONS COME UP.

00:58:46.256 --> 00:58:47.757
AS TO WHETHER OR NOT WE SHOULD

00:58:47.824 --> 00:58:49.425
DO SOMETHING OR HOW WE SHOULD

00:58:49.492 --> 00:58:50.894
DESIGN A CERTAIN FEATURE.

00:58:50.960 --> 00:58:52.362
SO I'LL GIVE AN EXAMPLE.

00:58:52.428 --> 00:58:53.830
LAST YEAR WE WERE APPROACHED BY

00:58:53.897 --> 00:58:55.598
A HOSPITAL A HOSPITAL THAT TAKES

00:58:55.665 --> 00:58:57.567
CARE OF A LOT OF PATIENTS WHO

00:58:57.634 --> 00:58:58.968
HAVE A CONDITION CALLED IPHONEA.

00:58:59.035 --> 00:59:00.270
SO I HAVEN'T HEARD OF THIS

00:59:00.336 --> 00:59:01.938
BEFORE LAST YEAR BUT A PHONY AS

00:59:02.005 --> 00:59:04.874
A CONDITION.

00:59:04.941 --> 00:59:06.109
WHERE PEOPLE?

00:59:06.175 --> 00:59:07.477
FOR ACCIDENT OR OTHER HAVE LOST

00:59:07.543 --> 00:59:09.412
THE ABILITY TO SPEAK SO THEY CAN

00:59:09.479 --> 00:59:11.147
STILL THINK AND THEY CAN STILL

00:59:11.214 --> 00:59:12.715
THEY KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THEY WANT

00:59:12.782 --> 00:59:14.150
TO SAY BUT WHEN THEY MOVE THEIR

00:59:14.217 --> 00:59:14.350
MOUTH.

00:59:14.417 --> 00:59:15.885
NO SOUND IS COMING OUT.

00:59:15.952 --> 00:59:16.953
AS YOU CAN IMAGINE THIS IS

00:59:17.020 --> 00:59:18.321
REALLY FRUSTRATING.

00:59:18.388 --> 00:59:19.889
CONDITION THEY'RE NOT ABLE TO

00:59:19.956 --> 00:59:21.124
IMMEDIATELY COMMUNICATE WITH

00:59:21.190 --> 00:59:22.258
THEIR FAMILY AND FRIENDS THE

00:59:22.325 --> 00:59:23.993
HOSPITAL CAME TO US AND SAID HEY

00:59:24.060 --> 00:59:25.561
WE HEARD GOOGLE IS DOING A LOT

00:59:25.628 --> 00:59:26.562
OF WORK WITH.

00:59:26.629 --> 00:59:28.264
A MACHINE LEARNING WITH TEXT TO

00:59:28.331 --> 00:59:29.565
SPEECH WE WONDER IF YOU COULD

00:59:29.632 --> 00:59:31.935
USE AB YOU KNOW YOUR TECHNOLOGY

00:59:32.001 --> 00:59:33.036
TO DEVELOP A NEURAL NET MODEL

00:59:33.102 --> 00:59:35.004
THAT COULD AUTOMATICALLY READ

00:59:35.071 --> 00:59:35.672
LIPS.

00:59:35.738 --> 00:59:37.307
THIS WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL FOR

00:59:37.373 --> 00:59:39.542
PATIENTS IN THAT INSTEAD OF YOU

00:59:39.609 --> 00:59:41.411
KNOW HAVING TO SIGN OR WRITE OR

00:59:41.477 --> 00:59:42.645
TYPE OR SPEAK THROUGH YOU KNOW

00:59:42.712 --> 00:59:44.047
COMPUTERIZED VOICE.

00:59:44.113 --> 00:59:45.415
THEY COULD ACTUALLY JUST MAKE

00:59:45.481 --> 00:59:46.549
THEIR MOUTH SAY WHAT THEY'RE

00:59:46.616 --> 00:59:49.252
TRYING TO SAY AND THEIR FAMILY

00:59:49.319 --> 00:59:49.886
MEMBERS WOULD KNOW WHAT THEY'RE

00:59:49.953 --> 00:59:50.119
SAYING.

00:59:50.186 --> 00:59:50.920
WELL WE THOUGHT ABOUT THIS

00:59:50.987 --> 00:59:52.855
BECAUSE OF COURSE ON FIRST BLUSH%

00:59:52.922 --> 00:59:53.957
WHO DOESN'T WANT TO HELP THESE

00:59:54.023 --> 00:59:55.091
KIND OF PATIENTS RIGHT THAT'S AN

00:59:55.158 --> 00:59:56.159
AMAZING USE CASE.

00:59:56.225 --> 00:59:57.527
SOMETHING THAT I'M YOU WOULD

00:59:57.593 --> 00:59:59.128
REALLY WANT TO BE ABLE TO HELP

00:59:59.195 --> 00:59:59.729
PEOPLE COMMUNICATE WITH THEIR

00:59:59.796 --> 01:00:00.863
LOVED ONES.

01:00:00.930 --> 01:00:02.765
HOWEVER YOU COULD ALSO IMAGINE

01:00:02.832 --> 01:00:04.233
KIND OF GOING ONE STEP FURTHER A

01:00:04.300 --> 01:00:05.635
LOT OF CHALLENGES AROUND THAT

01:00:05.702 --> 01:00:06.703
WHO HAS ACCESS TO THIS

01:00:06.769 --> 01:00:08.171
TECHNOLOGY WHO'S ABLE TO READ

01:00:08.237 --> 01:00:09.639
THIS PERSON'S LIPS.

01:00:09.706 --> 01:00:11.607
WHAT HAPPENS IF -- I DON'T KNOW

01:00:11.674 --> 01:00:12.909
LIKE A ROGUE ACTOR SOMEBODY

01:00:12.976 --> 01:00:14.777
WANTS TO SPY ON A CO WORKER

01:00:14.844 --> 01:00:16.713
FAMILY MEMBER COULD JUST HIDE A

01:00:16.779 --> 01:00:17.947
CAMERA AND THEN USE NEURAL NET

01:00:18.014 --> 01:00:19.482
MODEL TO SPY ON THEM.

01:00:19.549 --> 01:00:21.617
HOW WOULD WE CONTROL THE -- YOU

01:00:21.684 --> 01:00:22.352
KNOW SHARING OF THAT TYPE F

01:00:22.418 --> 01:00:24.387
MODEL -- WHAT HAPPENS AN EVEN

01:00:24.454 --> 01:00:25.421
LARGER SCALE WHAT ABOUT

01:00:25.488 --> 01:00:27.223
GOVERNMENTS YOU KNOW HOW MUCH

01:00:27.290 --> 01:00:29.225
GOVERNMENTS -- POWER SHOULD BE

01:00:29.292 --> 01:00:30.760
ABLE TO LOOK INTO LIVES OF

01:00:30.827 --> 01:00:32.295
PEOPLE WHO THOUGHT THEY WERE

01:00:32.362 --> 01:00:33.896
JUST WALKING BY ON THE SIDEWALK --

01:00:33.963 --> 01:00:36.799
WHAT HAPPENS IF THAT GETS INTO

01:00:36.866 --> 01:00:38.201
THE HANDS OF ROGUE GOVERNMENTS?

01:00:38.267 --> 01:00:39.168
I'M WHO HAVE INTENTIONS MAYBE

01:00:39.235 --> 01:00:40.603
EVEN AGAINST HUMAN RIGHTS SO WE

01:00:40.670 --> 01:00:42.572
DEBATED THIS A LOT INTERNALLY

01:00:42.638 --> 01:00:43.773
REALLY TRIED TO FIGURE OUT WHAT

01:00:43.840 --> 01:00:44.974
WE WANTED TO DO.

01:00:45.041 --> 01:00:47.176
THIS WAS JUST ONE EXAMPLE OF

01:00:47.243 --> 01:00:48.811
MANY OF THE KINDS OF CASES THAT

01:00:48.878 --> 01:00:50.513
WE'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT I'M IN

01:00:50.580 --> 01:00:51.814
THIS CASE THE WAY THAT WE ENDED

01:00:51.881 --> 01:00:53.516
UP RESOLVING IT WE DID WORK WITH

01:00:53.583 --> 01:00:54.650
THE HOSPITAL.

01:00:54.717 --> 01:00:56.185
WE DESIGNER ON THAT MODEL BUT IT

01:00:56.252 --> 01:00:57.587
ONLY WORKED FOR PATIENTS WHO

01:00:57.653 --> 01:00:59.122
WERE LOOKING DIRECTLY AT EIGHT

01:00:59.188 --> 01:01:00.523
ZERO DEGREE ANGLE SO IT WOULD

01:01:00.590 --> 01:01:02.925
NOT WORK FOR SURVEILLANCE

01:01:02.992 --> 01:01:04.660
CAMERAS THAT WERE.

01:01:04.727 --> 01:01:06.596
POSTED AT A DISTANCE AT AN ANGLE.

01:01:06.662 --> 01:01:08.531
PACIFIC WE WITH THEM AND TO MAKE

01:01:08.598 --> 01:01:10.233
SURE THAT THE TIME RESOLUTION

01:01:10.299 --> 01:01:12.235
AND THE SPATIAL RESOLUTION WAS

01:01:12.301 --> 01:01:14.237
SUCH THAT IT WOULD ONLY WORK FOR

01:01:14.303 --> 01:01:15.405
PATIENTS WHO HAVE OPTED INTO

01:01:15.471 --> 01:01:17.106
SPEAKING OVER A WEBCAM OR INTO

01:01:17.173 --> 01:01:18.608
SPECIFIC CAMERA.

01:01:18.674 --> 01:01:20.043
WITH THEIR FRIENDS AND FAMILY

01:01:20.109 --> 01:01:22.245
AND WE ALSO ONLY SHARE THE MODEL

01:01:22.311 --> 01:01:23.312
WITH THE HOSPITAL SO THAT'S

01:01:23.379 --> 01:01:24.247
PROJECT THAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING

01:01:24.313 --> 01:01:25.982
WITH THEM ON SPECIFICALLY TO

01:01:26.049 --> 01:01:27.750
DEVELOP -- WHILE WE PUBLISHED

01:01:27.817 --> 01:01:29.118
THE RESEARCH WE NOT PUBLISHER

01:01:29.185 --> 01:01:31.287
OPEN SOURCE MODEL SO THAT'S WAY

01:01:31.354 --> 01:01:32.989
THAT WE KIND OF ADDRESS STOCK --

01:01:33.056 --> 01:01:34.290
BUT AS I MENTIONED THERE'S BEEN

01:01:34.357 --> 01:01:36.059
HUNDREDS OF CASES LIKE THIS AND

01:01:36.125 --> 01:01:38.227
AS A COMPANY LAST JUNE WE

01:01:38.294 --> 01:01:39.962
ACTUALLY DECIDED TO PUT TGETHER.

01:01:40.029 --> 01:01:41.497
A SET OF OUR OWN GOOGLE A AYE

01:01:41.564 --> 01:01:42.832
PRINCIPLES FOR RESPONSIBLE

01:01:42.899 --> 01:01:44.400
DEVELOPMENT THIS WAS OUR

01:01:44.467 --> 01:01:45.701
COMPANY'S WAY OF SETTING OUT

01:01:45.768 --> 01:01:47.370
WHAT OUR OWN ETHICAL CHARTER IS

01:01:47.437 --> 01:01:50.473
HOW WE SHOULD GUIDE OF THE

01:01:50.540 --> 01:01:52.308
RESPONSIBLE USE.

01:01:52.375 --> 01:01:52.842
OF THIS TECHNOLOGY AT THE

01:01:52.909 --> 01:01:54.277
COMPANY I'M HAPPY TO GO INTO ANY

01:01:54.343 --> 01:01:55.878
OF THESE IN MORE DETAIL ON THE

01:01:55.945 --> 01:01:57.180
LEFT YOU'LL SEE SEVEN THINGS

01:01:57.246 --> 01:01:59.182
THAT WE THOUGHT A I SHOULD DO

01:01:59.248 --> 01:02:00.383
YOU OR BE RIGHT BE SOCIALLY

01:02:00.450 --> 01:02:01.617
BENEFICIAL.

01:02:01.684 --> 01:02:03.453
AVOID CREATING A REINFORCING

01:02:03.519 --> 01:02:04.754
UNFAIR BIAS BE BUILT AND TESTED

01:02:04.821 --> 01:02:05.988
FOR SAFETY BE ACCOUNTABLE TO

01:02:06.055 --> 01:02:07.723
PEOPLE CORPORATE PRIVACY DESIGN

01:02:07.790 --> 01:02:08.391
PRINCIPLES.

01:02:08.458 --> 01:02:09.759
UPHOLD HIGH STANDARDS OF

01:02:09.826 --> 01:02:11.227
SCIENTIFIC EXCELLENCE AND THE

01:02:11.294 --> 01:02:12.962
NUMBER SEVEN BE MADE AVAILABLE

01:02:13.029 --> 01:02:14.297
FOR USES THAT ACCORD WITH THESE

01:02:14.363 --> 01:02:16.099
PRINCIPLES AGAIN HAPPY TO GO

01:02:16.165 --> 01:02:17.867
INTO THIS IN MORE DETAIL BUT

01:02:17.934 --> 01:02:19.235
THIS NUMBER SEVEN WAS REALLY

01:02:19.302 --> 01:02:20.770
AROUND THE IDEA THAT GOOGLE.

01:02:20.837 --> 01:02:21.771
WE DON'T WANT TO BE THE ONES

01:02:21.838 --> 01:02:22.939
THAT JUST CREATE THE TECHNOLOGY

01:02:23.005 --> 01:02:25.074
AND HOLD ON TO IT WE THINK LOADS

01:02:25.141 --> 01:02:25.808
OF PEOPLE ARE WORKING ON

01:02:25.875 --> 01:02:27.743
IMPORTANT PROBLEMS WE WANT THEM

01:02:27.810 --> 01:02:29.045
TO BE ABLE TO HAVE ACCESS TO THE

01:02:29.112 --> 01:02:29.779
TECHNOLOGY.

01:02:29.846 --> 01:02:31.347
AS LONG AS THEY'RE DOING SO IN A

01:02:31.414 --> 01:02:34.484
RESPONSIBLE MANNER SO WE'VE

01:02:34.550 --> 01:02:35.818
RELEASED A LOT OF DIFFERENT.

01:02:35.885 --> 01:02:36.919
I'M OPEN SOURCE MODELS TOOLS OUR

01:02:36.986 --> 01:02:38.087
OWN MACHINE LEARNING LIBRARY

01:02:38.154 --> 01:02:39.455
TENSER FLOW WHICH WE USE FOR

01:02:39.522 --> 01:02:40.823
INTERNAL DEVELOPMENT WE

01:02:40.890 --> 01:02:42.492
COMPLETELY OPEN SOURCE LOTS OF

01:02:42.558 --> 01:02:43.359
OTHER PEOPLE.

01:02:43.426 --> 01:02:45.294
OUTSIDE CAN USE IT ON THE RIGHT

01:02:45.361 --> 01:02:47.263
YOU'LL SEE FOR APPLICATIONS THAT

01:02:47.330 --> 01:02:48.731
WE WILL NOT PURSUE.

01:02:48.798 --> 01:02:49.732
ANY THAT ARE LIKELY TO CAUSE

01:02:49.799 --> 01:02:51.434
OVERALL HARM PRINCIPLE PURPOSE

01:02:51.501 --> 01:02:53.436
IS TO DIRECT INJURY SURVEILLANCE

01:02:53.503 --> 01:02:54.570
VIOLATING INTERNATIONALLY

01:02:54.637 --> 01:02:57.173
ACCEPTED NORMS AND THE NUMBER

01:02:57.240 --> 01:02:58.641
FOUR AND THOSE WHOSE PURPOSE.

01:02:58.708 --> 01:03:00.276
CONTRAVENES INTERNATIONAL LAW

01:03:00.343 --> 01:03:02.245
AND HUMAN RIGHTS THIS IS THE SET

01:03:02.311 --> 01:03:03.546
OF PRINCIPLES THAT WE HAVE BEEN

01:03:03.613 --> 01:03:06.149
USING -- OVER THE LAST.

01:03:06.215 --> 01:03:08.017
YEAR YEAR AND A FEW WEEKS I'M TO

01:03:08.084 --> 01:03:09.752
REALLY ASSESS EVERY SINGLE CASE

01:03:09.819 --> 01:03:11.454
EVERY FEATURE EVERY PRODUCT

01:03:11.521 --> 01:03:12.622
EVERY RESEARCH PAPER THAT WE GET

01:03:12.688 --> 01:03:14.223
OUT TO TRY TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:03:14.290 --> 01:03:15.258
WERE LIVING UP TO THE

01:03:15.324 --> 01:03:16.592
COMMITMENTS WE'VE SET UP.

01:03:16.659 --> 01:03:18.094
OF COURSE IT'S NOT ALWAYS EASY

01:03:18.161 --> 01:03:19.729
THERE ARE CASES WHERE SOME OF

01:03:19.795 --> 01:03:20.897
THE PRINCIPLES COME INTO

01:03:20.963 --> 01:03:22.365
CONFLICT RIGHT EVERYBODY WANTS

01:03:22.431 --> 01:03:23.833
FAIRNESS EVERYBODY WANTS PRIVACY

01:03:23.900 --> 01:03:25.034
EVERYONE WANTS ACUITY BUT THERE

01:03:25.101 --> 01:03:26.335
ARE PLACES WHERE YOU NEED TO

01:03:26.402 --> 01:03:27.336
MAKE TRADE OFFS.

01:03:27.403 --> 01:03:28.271
AND THESE ARE SOME OF THE

01:03:28.337 --> 01:03:31.040
CHALLENGING ISSUES THAT WE HAVE

01:03:31.107 --> 01:03:31.607
BEEN GRAPPLING WITH OVER THE

01:03:31.674 --> 01:03:32.542
PAST YEAR.

01:03:32.608 --> 01:03:33.776
LOT OF PEOPLE TALK ABOUT A AYE

01:03:33.843 --> 01:03:35.978
BIAS I DO WANT TO MAKE THIS ONE

01:03:36.045 --> 01:03:37.880
POINT HERE THAT A I CAN ALSO

01:03:37.947 --> 01:03:39.415
HELP YOU MEANS TO BE MORE

01:03:39.482 --> 01:03:40.683
RESPONSIBLE.

01:03:40.750 --> 01:03:43.452
AND SO THE GINA DAVIS INSTITUTE

01:03:43.519 --> 01:03:45.154
CAME TO US A FEW YEARS AGO GINA

01:03:45.221 --> 01:03:46.822
DAVIS HAD A HUNCH THAT WOMEN ARE

01:03:46.889 --> 01:03:48.457
UNDER REPRESENTED IN FILM AND

01:03:48.524 --> 01:03:49.559
MEDIA SHE SAID.

01:03:49.625 --> 01:03:51.561
HEY YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN IN THIS

01:03:51.627 --> 01:03:52.828
BUSINESS A LONG TIME I FEEL LIKE

01:03:52.895 --> 01:03:54.397
WOMEN HAVE LESS SCREEN TIME IF

01:03:54.463 --> 01:03:55.264
YOU LIKE WOMEN HAVE LESS

01:03:55.331 --> 01:03:56.365
SPEAKING TIME THEY'RE NOT

01:03:56.432 --> 01:03:57.300
TREATED FAIRLY.

01:03:57.366 --> 01:03:58.868
HOWEVER I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO

01:03:58.935 --> 01:04:00.102
PUT MY FINGER ON I HAVEN'T BEEN

01:04:00.169 --> 01:04:02.138
ABLE TO QUANTIFY EXACTLY WHAT

01:04:02.205 --> 01:04:03.639
THAT LOOKS LIKE WE PARTNER

01:04:03.706 --> 01:04:05.007
TOGETHER BUILDING MACHINE

01:04:05.074 --> 01:04:06.375
LEARNING MODEL THAT CAN

01:04:06.442 --> 01:04:07.977
AUTOMATICALLY IDENTIFY FACES OF

01:04:08.044 --> 01:04:09.312
MEN AND AUTOMATICALLY IDENTIFY

01:04:09.378 --> 01:04:10.980
FACES OF WOMEN.

01:04:11.047 --> 01:04:11.781
WORKING TOGETHER WITH THE GINA

01:04:11.847 --> 01:04:13.416
DAVIS INSTITUTE OUR MODEL

01:04:13.482 --> 01:04:15.184
WATCHED THOSANDS AND THOUSANDS

01:04:15.251 --> 01:04:16.652
OF MOVIES AND ACTUALLY

01:04:16.719 --> 01:04:18.588
DOCUMENTED WHEN A MAN WAS ON

01:04:18.654 --> 01:04:20.122
STAGE WHEN A WOMAN WAS ON STAGE

01:04:20.189 --> 01:04:21.490
AND WHEN THEY WERE SPEAKING.

01:04:21.557 --> 01:04:22.892
THAT SOMETHING THAT NO PERSON

01:04:22.959 --> 01:04:24.193
WOULD BE ABLE TO DO NO ONE'S

01:04:24.260 --> 01:04:25.494
GOING TO SIT THERE AND YOU KNOW

01:04:25.561 --> 01:04:27.396
BOX AND LABEL ALL THESE

01:04:27.463 --> 01:04:30.299
DIFFERENT TIMES FOR MILLIONS OF

01:04:30.366 --> 01:04:31.634
HOURS OF FOOTAGE.

01:04:31.701 --> 01:04:32.969
WE SHOULD -- WITH THE GENE DAVIS

01:04:33.035 --> 01:04:34.036
INSTITUTE WAS THAT MEN IN FACT

01:04:34.103 --> 01:04:35.605
DO YOU HAVE MUCH MORE SCREEN AND

01:04:35.671 --> 01:04:38.407
SPEAKING TIME ABOUT SEVENTY TO

01:04:38.474 --> 01:04:40.009
THIRTY AND IN FACT IN THE NEXT

01:04:40.076 --> 01:04:40.843
STEP BEYOND THAT.

01:04:40.910 --> 01:04:43.579
AT FILMS THAT HAD WOMEN IN 50%

01:04:43.646 --> 01:04:44.780
OR MORE OF THE SCREEN AND

01:04:44.847 --> 01:04:46.415
SPEAKING TIME DID BETTER AT THE

01:04:46.482 --> 01:04:47.350
BOX OFFICE.

01:04:47.416 --> 01:04:48.451
SO THIS IS SOMETHING THAT GINA

01:04:48.517 --> 01:04:49.652
DAVIS AND HER TEAM COULD

01:04:49.719 --> 01:04:52.188
ACTUALLY TAKE TWO STUDIOS ON TO

01:04:52.255 --> 01:04:53.489
TRY TO PROMOTE WOMEN MORE IN

01:04:53.556 --> 01:04:54.490
MEDIA.

01:04:54.557 --> 01:04:56.259
I IT'S AN EXAMPLE THAT I WOULD

01:04:56.325 --> 01:04:57.660
NOT HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE WITHOUT

01:04:57.727 --> 01:04:59.328
THE USE OF MACHINE LEARNING SO

01:04:59.395 --> 01:05:02.231
WANTED TO POINT OUT THERE ARE A

01:05:02.298 --> 01:05:03.899
LOT OF OPPORTUNITIES HERE. TO

01:05:03.966 --> 01:05:05.067
MAKE US BETTER.

01:05:05.134 --> 01:05:06.369
LAST PAGE JUST TO GIVE YOU A

01:05:06.435 --> 01:05:08.104
SNEAK PREVIEW OF HOW WE'RE

01:05:08.170 --> 01:05:09.305
THINKING ABOUT A I AT THE

01:05:09.372 --> 01:05:10.840
COMPANY WHAT'S COMING NEXT FROM

01:05:10.906 --> 01:05:11.440
US.

01:05:11.507 --> 01:05:13.376
THERE'S REALLY THREE MAIN AREAS

01:05:13.442 --> 01:05:14.844
THAT WERE WORKING IN NUMBER ONE

01:05:14.910 --> 01:05:16.612
CUTTING EDGE RESEARCH NUMBER TWO

01:05:16.679 --> 01:05:17.980
APPLICATIONS.

01:05:18.047 --> 01:05:18.814
NUMBER THREE HUMAN A AYE

01:05:18.881 --> 01:05:20.449
INTERACTION SO IN NOT CUTTING

01:05:20.516 --> 01:05:22.285
EDGE RESEARCH AREA I LISTED

01:05:22.351 --> 01:05:23.619
SEVERAL DIFFERENT PLACES I'LL

01:05:23.686 --> 01:05:24.754
CALL OUT A FEW.

01:05:24.820 --> 01:05:26.756
NUMBER ONE SMALL DATA WE'VE

01:05:26.822 --> 01:05:28.090
TALKED A LOT ABOUT LEARNING FROM

01:05:28.157 --> 01:05:30.159
BIG DATA FROM EXAMPLES MILLIONS

01:05:30.226 --> 01:05:31.694
OF PHOTOS THAT KIND OF THING.

01:05:31.761 --> 01:05:33.462
HOWEVER THERE ARE A LOT OF CASES

01:05:33.529 --> 01:05:36.265
IN THE WORLD YOU'VE GOT VERY.

01:05:36.332 --> 01:05:38.601
RARE SEARCH QUERIES FOR RARE

01:05:38.668 --> 01:05:40.202
DISEASES OR RARE LANGUAGES NO AS

01:05:40.269 --> 01:05:41.804
HUMANS WERE ACTUALLY ABLE TO

01:05:41.871 --> 01:05:43.172
LEARN FROM JUST A SMALL NUMBER

01:05:43.239 --> 01:05:44.640
OF EXAMPLES YOU LOOK AT A THREE

01:05:44.707 --> 01:05:45.975
YEAR OLD A FOUR YEAR OLD.

01:05:46.042 --> 01:05:47.576
THEY CAN PROBABLY SEE FOR FIRE

01:05:47.643 --> 01:05:49.011
TRUCKS MAYBE FIVE FIRE TRUCKS IN

01:05:49.078 --> 01:05:50.446
THE AUTOMATICALLY NOTIFIED TRUCK

01:05:50.513 --> 01:05:52.148
IS THERE'S A LOT OF RESEARCH

01:05:52.214 --> 01:05:54.216
GOING ON AT OUR COMPANY AS WELL

01:05:54.283 --> 01:05:55.851
AS OTHERS INTO HOW CAN WE BUILD

01:05:55.918 --> 01:05:57.386
BETTER MODELS THAT CAN LEARN

01:05:57.453 --> 01:05:58.721
FROM SMALL DATA EXAMPLES.

01:05:58.788 --> 01:06:00.056
THIS IS GREAT FOR THOSE RARE

01:06:00.122 --> 01:06:02.058
CASES IT'S ALSO GREAT FOR

01:06:02.124 --> 01:06:03.626
PRIVACY IT'S GREAT FOR A LOT OF

01:06:03.693 --> 01:06:05.528
DIFFERENT REASONS -- AND YOU

01:06:05.594 --> 01:06:07.697
KNOW I WOULD SAY THE RESEARCH IS

01:06:07.763 --> 01:06:08.898
STILL.

01:06:08.964 --> 01:06:09.932
INCIPIENT SO JUST IN ITS EARLY

01:06:09.999 --> 01:06:11.701
DAYS BUT IT IS A PROMISING ON

01:06:11.767 --> 01:06:13.336
AREA THERE'S A LOT OF WORK GOING

01:06:13.402 --> 01:06:15.004
INTO LANGUAGE UNDERSTANDING

01:06:15.071 --> 01:06:16.138
MACHINE PERCEPTION BEING ABLE TO

01:06:16.205 --> 01:06:17.673
LOOKAT A SCENE AND UNDERSTAND

01:06:17.740 --> 01:06:18.974
WHAT'S HAPPENING THERE YOU CAN

01:06:19.041 --> 01:06:20.943
IMAGINE LOADS OF ACCESSIBILITY

01:06:21.010 --> 01:06:22.144
AS WELL AS OTHER REASONS WHY

01:06:22.211 --> 01:06:23.379
THAT'S IMPORTANT.

01:06:23.446 --> 01:06:25.981
IN TERMS OF UP WITH.

01:06:26.048 --> 01:06:27.383
ACROSS THE BOARD INSIDE THE

01:06:27.450 --> 01:06:29.752
COMPANY WE'RE LOOKING -- ACROSS

USING MACHINE LEARNING FOR THE

01:06:45.835 --> 01:06:47.169
SECTORS AND MORE SO WE'RE ALSO

01:06:47.236 --> 01:06:49.538
DOING OUR BEST TO CREATE TOOLS

THAT THOSE.

01:06:49.905 --> 01:06:51.474
PEOPLE CAN USE.

01:06:51.540 --> 01:06:52.775
AND KIND OF RUN WITH.

01:06:52.842 --> 01:06:54.343
ON THE LAST PIECE YOU'LL SEE HIM

01:06:54.410 --> 01:06:56.679
IN A AYE INTERACTION -- IVORY IN

01:06:56.746 --> 01:06:58.381
HERE INTERFACE EASE OF USE WHY

01:06:58.447 --> 01:07:00.383
PARTICIPATION THIS IS SOMETHING

01:07:00.449 --> 01:07:01.417
THAT SEEMS REALLY IMPORTANT.

01:07:01.484 --> 01:07:02.485
THE LAST THING THAT WE WOULD

01:07:02.551 --> 01:07:04.286
WANT IS FOR THIS TECHNOLOGY

01:07:04.353 --> 01:07:05.588
WHICH YOU KNOW ON ITS FACE MAY

01:07:05.654 --> 01:07:07.223
SOUND COMPLICATED TO BE

01:07:07.289 --> 01:07:08.858
SOMETHING THAT IS BEEN RELEGATED

01:07:08.924 --> 01:07:09.892
JUST TO PEOPLE WHO HAVE

01:07:09.959 --> 01:07:12.194
EXPERTISE AND INCREASINGLY OTHER

01:07:12.261 --> 01:07:13.629
PEOPLE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO

01:07:13.696 --> 01:07:15.064
ACCESS IT OR HAVE USE.

01:07:15.131 --> 01:07:17.066
OF IT I'M WE THINK IT'S CRUCIAL

01:07:17.133 --> 01:07:18.601
FOR THERE TO BE WHY

01:07:18.667 --> 01:07:20.736
PARTICIPATION EDUCATION HAPPY TO

01:07:20.803 --> 01:07:21.771
GO INTO A LOT OF THESE DIFFERENT

01:07:21.837 --> 01:07:22.371
ISSUES.

01:07:22.438 --> 01:07:23.906
INTERFACE HAVE WRITTEN HERE YOU

01:07:23.973 --> 01:07:25.808
KNOW MOST OF US IN THIS ROOM WE

01:07:25.875 --> 01:07:27.376
CAN PROBABLY DRIVE A CAR BUT

01:07:27.443 --> 01:07:28.744
MOST OF US DON'T KNOW HOW TO

01:07:28.811 --> 01:07:29.412
BUILD A CAR.

01:07:29.478 --> 01:07:31.113
I THINK THAT'S A SIMILAR ANALOGY

01:07:31.180 --> 01:07:32.248
THAT WE'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT

01:07:32.314 --> 01:07:33.849
WITH MACHINE LEARNING MODELS WE

01:07:33.916 --> 01:07:35.484
THINK THEY'RE VERY POWERFUL.

01:07:35.551 --> 01:07:36.352
THERE'S A LOT OF WORK GOING INTO

01:07:36.419 --> 01:07:37.953
WHAT SHOULD THOSE HUMAN COMPUTER

01:07:38.020 --> 01:07:39.455
INTERFACES LOOK LIKE SO A LOT OF

01:07:39.522 --> 01:07:41.190
PEOPLE CAN OPERATE MACHINE

01:07:41.257 --> 01:07:42.358
LEARNING MODELS.

01:07:42.425 --> 01:07:43.793
EVEN IF THEY DON'T NECESSARILY

01:07:43.859 --> 01:07:45.361
KNOW HOW TO BUILD THEM -- SO

01:07:45.428 --> 01:07:46.595
I'LL LEAVE IT THERE I THINK

01:07:46.662 --> 01:07:47.163
THERE'S A TON OF DIFFERENT

01:07:47.229 --> 01:07:48.697
OPPORTUNITIES A LOT OF DIFFERENT

01:07:48.764 --> 01:07:52.568
THINGS THAT WE NEED TO WORK ON

01:07:52.635 --> 01:07:54.003
TOGETHER THANKS.

01:07:54.069 --> 01:07:55.004
THANK YOU DOCTOR CHAO A MOST

EARLIER THAT WE HAVE T BE IN

01:07:56.472 --> 01:07:59.141
MANY PLACES AT THE SAME TIME.

01:07:59.208 --> 01:08:01.010

ABOUT THE BIAS -- WITH RESPECT

01:08:09.084 --> 01:08:09.652
TO THE FILM INDUSTRY IT MIGHT BE

01:08:09.718 --> 01:08:10.352
SOMETHING.

01:08:10.419 --> 01:08:11.520
ALL OF US ARE INTERESTED IN YOU

01:08:11.587 --> 01:08:12.822
MAY WANT TO TALK TO DOCTOR CHAO

ABOUT OF WHAT ONE OF THE

01:08:14.290 --> 01:08:15.724
CONCERNS AND I THINK IT'S A

01:08:15.791 --> 01:08:17.092
GENERAL CONCERN.

01:08:17.159 --> 01:08:19.128
IS TRANSPARENCY IN TERMS OF THE

01:08:19.195 --> 01:08:20.663
COLLECTION ANALYSIS AND THOSE

01:08:20.729 --> 01:08:22.164
KINDS OF THINGS AND AND MAYBE

01:08:22.231 --> 01:08:24.433
YOU CAN SPEAK TO THAT I REALIZE

01:08:24.500 --> 01:08:26.135
THAT FOR EXAMPLE GOOGLE OR OTHER

01:08:26.202 --> 01:08:27.436
ENTITIES.

01:08:27.503 --> 01:08:29.772
NO YOU YOU YOU CAN'T.

01:08:29.839 --> 01:08:31.140
YOU CAN'T REVEAL TRADE SECRETS

01:08:31.207 --> 01:08:34.176
BUT TO THE EXTENT THAT YOU CAN --

01:08:34.243 --> 01:08:35.411
REVEAL.

01:08:35.478 --> 01:08:37.880
OF FOR EXAMPLE WHAT WHAT KIND OF

01:08:37.947 --> 01:08:40.616
TRANSPARENCY WILL BE ACCESSIBLE

01:08:40.683 --> 01:08:42.351
TO THE INDIVIDUAL WHO IS --

01:08:42.418 --> 01:08:43.919
INTERFACING WITH WITH GOOGLE

01:08:43.986 --> 01:08:45.387
YEAH DEFINITELY THIS IS

01:08:45.454 --> 01:08:46.789
SOMETHING THAT WE TALK ABOUT.

01:08:46.856 --> 01:08:48.524
A LOT YOU THINK ABOUT ALL THE

01:08:48.591 --> 01:08:49.725
DIFFERENT TYPES OF MODELS AT

01:08:49.792 --> 01:08:51.393
GOOGLE WE THOUGHT A LOT ABOUT

01:08:51.460 --> 01:08:52.661
YOU KNOW WHAT DOES THE OPTIMAL

01:08:52.728 --> 01:08:54.396
TRANSPARENCY LOOK LIKE IN OUR A.

01:08:54.463 --> 01:08:55.965
I. PRINCIPLES WE'VE STATED.

01:08:56.031 --> 01:08:57.433
AS NUMBER FOR A I SHOULD BE

01:08:57.500 --> 01:08:58.901
ACCOUNTABLE AND WITHIN THAT

01:08:58.968 --> 01:09:00.669
ACCOUNTABILITY WE WOULD CONSIDER

01:09:00.736 --> 01:09:02.605
EXPLAIN ABILITY TRANSPARENCY AS

01:09:02.671 --> 01:09:04.073
WELL AS THE NEED AND AND THE

01:09:04.139 --> 01:09:05.808
ABILITY FOR SOMEBODY.

01:09:05.875 --> 01:09:06.909
TO CONTEST YOU KNOW THE KIND OF

01:09:06.976 --> 01:09:08.077
ANSWER PRODUCTION COMING FROM

01:09:08.143 --> 01:09:09.278
MODEL.

01:09:09.345 --> 01:09:10.012
I'M SO THERE'S A COUPLE

01:09:10.079 --> 01:09:11.413
DIFFERENT WAYS TO LOOK AT IT YOU

01:09:11.480 --> 01:09:13.315
MENTIONED AND TRADE SECRETS OF

01:09:13.382 --> 01:09:14.550
COURSE THAT IS SOMETHING THERE'S

01:09:14.617 --> 01:09:16.452
PROPRIETARY CONCERNS YOU KNOW WE

01:09:16.519 --> 01:09:17.887
WANT TO BE ABLE TO PROTECT THAT.

01:09:17.953 --> 01:09:19.421
BUT THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT

01:09:19.488 --> 01:09:20.856
OTHER PIECES IN IT TOO IF YOU

01:09:20.923 --> 01:09:24.793
THINK ABOUT SEARCH SEARCH MODEL

01:09:24.860 --> 01:09:25.661
FOR EXAMPLE.

01:09:25.728 --> 01:09:26.595
AND IF YOU WERE TO SHOW THE

01:09:26.662 --> 01:09:28.764
EXACT COMPLETE MODEL I'M WE HAVE

01:09:28.831 --> 01:09:30.065
YOU KNOW NO DOUBT THAT PEOPLE

01:09:30.132 --> 01:09:31.600
WOULD USE THAT AND TRY TO HACK

01:09:31.667 --> 01:09:32.535
THE SYSTEM.

01:09:32.601 --> 01:09:34.270
SO WE TALK ABOUT PRIVACY RE TALK

01:09:34.336 --> 01:09:36.105
ABOUT SECURITY YOU KNOW WHAT

01:09:36.171 --> 01:09:37.072
WOULD HAPPEN IF SOMEBODY

01:09:37.139 --> 01:09:38.340
ACTUALLY HACKED THAT MODEL AND

01:09:38.407 --> 01:09:39.909
MADE ON YOU KNOW DIFFERENT

01:09:39.975 --> 01:09:41.610
RESULTS OF YOUR AN EARLIER OR

01:09:41.677 --> 01:09:43.212
LATER.

01:09:43.279 --> 01:09:44.647
I'M ACTUALLY TRYING.

01:09:44.713 --> 01:09:46.181
TO MAYBE I'VE DISRUPTS

01:09:46.248 --> 01:09:47.683
TRANSLATION FOR GOOGLE TRANSLATE

01:09:47.750 --> 01:09:49.818
OR YOU KNOW VIDEOS FOR YOU TO

01:09:49.885 --> 01:09:51.253
BURKE OR ANY OF THE LIKE SO

01:09:51.320 --> 01:09:52.087
THAT'S ANOTHER THING THAT WE

01:09:52.154 --> 01:09:53.222
THINK ABOUT HOW DO WE PROTECT

01:09:53.289 --> 01:09:54.757
PRIVACY AND SECURITY OF OUR

01:09:54.823 --> 01:09:56.358
MODELS THINK ABOUT RESPONSIBLE

01:09:56.425 --> 01:09:57.626
DEVELOPMENT.

01:09:57.693 --> 01:09:59.795
WHILE ALSO BEING AS TRANSPARENT

01:09:59.862 --> 01:10:01.597
AS POSSIBLE ANOTHER I DID

01:10:01.664 --> 01:10:02.932
MENTION THAT WE THINK ABOUT IS

01:10:02.998 --> 01:10:04.567
WHAT IS THE MOST USEFUL FOR THE

01:10:04.633 --> 01:10:05.367
USER.

01:10:05.434 --> 01:10:07.136
SO WE TALK ABOUT TRANSPARENCY

01:10:07.202 --> 01:10:08.370
YOU KNOW SOMETIMES WE'VE HEARD

01:10:08.437 --> 01:10:10.039
I'M PEOPLE CALL FOR ME HAD THESE

01:10:10.105 --> 01:10:11.941
DISCUSSIONS INTERNALLY ALSO WHAT

01:10:12.007 --> 01:10:13.208
IF YOU KNOW FOR GOOGLE TRANSLATE

01:10:13.275 --> 01:10:14.143
WE JUST PUBLISHED THE FULL

01:10:14.209 --> 01:10:15.644
SOURCE CODE AND MEAN ABLE PEOPLE

01:10:15.711 --> 01:10:16.845
TO TAKE A LOOK AT NOW BE

01:10:16.912 --> 01:10:18.080
COMPLETELY TRANSPARENT.

01:10:18.147 --> 01:10:19.582
WELL TO MOST PEOPLE THAT WOULD

01:10:19.648 --> 01:10:20.950
BE COMPLETELY USELESS THEY

01:10:21.016 --> 01:10:22.818
WOULDN'T NECESSARILY UNDERSTAND

01:10:22.885 --> 01:10:24.320
WHAT ANY OF THAT SOURCE COULD

01:10:24.386 --> 01:10:25.554
MEAN THAT'S NOT REALLY GETTING

01:10:25.621 --> 01:10:26.355
THEM TO THE ANSWERS THAT THEY

01:10:26.422 --> 01:10:26.956
WANT.

01:10:27.022 --> 01:10:28.090
ON THE ALSO THINK ABOUT WHAT

01:10:28.157 --> 01:10:29.592
DOES IT MEAN FOR DIFFERENT USER

01:10:29.658 --> 01:10:32.795
SO AS WE'RE STARTING TO PARTNER

01:10:32.861 --> 01:10:34.263
A LOT WITH CLINICIANS POSITIONS.

01:10:34.330 --> 01:10:35.030
HOSPITAL THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM

01:10:35.097 --> 01:10:35.698
YOU KNOW WHAT KIND OF

01:10:35.764 --> 01:10:36.899
EXPLANATIONS WHAT KIND OF

01:10:36.966 --> 01:10:38.801
TRANSPARENCY DO DOCTORS NEED IN

01:10:38.867 --> 01:10:40.970
ORDER TO TRUST AND ANSWER I'M AT

01:10:41.036 --> 01:10:41.870
HOW'S THAT DIFFERENT FROM

01:10:41.937 --> 01:10:43.005
PATIENTS HOW'S THAT DIFFERENT

01:10:43.072 --> 01:10:44.707
FROM NURSES OR TECHNICIANS OR

01:10:44.773 --> 01:10:46.642
MAYBE THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY IN.

01:10:46.709 --> 01:10:48.310
DIFFERENT ANSWERS FOR DIFFERENT.

01:10:48.377 --> 01:10:49.311
I'M PEOPLE SO THAT'S SOMETHING

01:10:49.378 --> 01:10:51.413
WE'VE BEEN I'M THINKING A LOT

01:10:51.480 --> 01:10:53.315
ABOUT AND IN THE CASE OF AT

01:10:53.382 --> 01:10:54.483
HEALTH CARE INDUSTRY OR

01:10:54.550 --> 01:10:55.918
TRANSPORTATION OR OTHERS WE

01:10:55.985 --> 01:10:57.019
ACTUALLY THINK IT'S ABSOLUTELY

01:10:57.086 --> 01:10:58.921
CRUCIAL TO BE WORKING WITH THE

01:10:58.988 --> 01:11:01.023
LEGISLATORS REGULATORS EXPERTS

01:11:01.090 --> 01:11:02.524
IN THOSE -- YOU KNOW WHEN HEALTH

01:11:02.591 --> 01:11:04.226
CARE FOR EXAMPLE WE DON'T THINK

01:11:04.293 --> 01:11:05.594
IT SHOULD BE UP TO GOOGLE IT'S

01:11:05.661 --> 01:11:07.296
NOT OUR RESPONSIBILITY BUT ALSO

01:11:07.363 --> 01:11:08.897
NOT OUR EXPERTISE TO SAY DOCTOR

01:11:08.964 --> 01:11:10.132
SHOULD KNOW THIS AND PATIENTS

01:11:10.199 --> 01:11:11.533
SHOULD KNOW THIS AND TECHNICIANS

01:11:11.600 --> 01:11:13.035
KNOW THIS RIGHT BUT WE'VE GOT TO

01:11:13.102 --> 01:11:14.570
WORK TOGETHER TO IDENTIFY.

01:11:14.637 --> 01:11:16.438
WHAT ARE THOSE CRUCIAL ASPECTS

01:11:16.505 --> 01:11:17.506
OF TRANSPARENCY THAT NEED TO BE

01:11:17.573 --> 01:11:19.408
KNOWN HOW CAN WE TRY TO BUILD

01:11:19.475 --> 01:11:20.242
MODELS THAT CAN SHOW THAT

01:11:20.309 --> 01:11:21.877
BECAUSE DR SINGH SAID IT'S NOT

01:11:21.944 --> 01:11:23.312
PERFECT WE DON'T ALWAYS KNOW

01:11:23.379 --> 01:11:25.080
EXACTLY WHY MODELS ARE

01:11:25.147 --> 01:11:26.682
PREDICTING THINGS THEY DO -- BUT

01:11:26.749 --> 01:11:28.017
THERE'S A LOT OF WORK GOING INTO

01:11:28.083 --> 01:11:30.386
THAT SO HOW COULD WE I'M KIND OF

01:11:30.452 --> 01:11:31.654
BEST DESIGN MODELS IN THAT WAY.

01:11:31.720 --> 01:11:33.288
ON THE LAST POINT I'LL TOUCH ON

01:11:33.355 --> 01:11:37.226
IN THIS IS RELATED -- TO BILL

01:11:37.292 --> 01:11:38.727
THAT YOU.

01:11:38.794 --> 01:11:39.628
OPPOSE CENTER ON BURKE IS THIS

01:11:39.695 --> 01:11:40.195
IDEA OF HOW CAN WE BE MORE

01:11:40.262 --> 01:11:41.063
TRANSPARENT ABOUT WHAT THE MODEL

01:11:41.130 --> 01:11:41.630
OR WHAT THE DATA SETS ARE

01:11:41.697 --> 01:11:43.365
ACTUALLY COMPRISED OF AND WHAT

01:11:43.432 --> 01:11:44.299
THEY'RE LEARNING.

01:11:44.366 --> 01:11:46.602
ON NEW WE CALL THESE DATA CARDS

01:11:46.669 --> 01:11:48.370
WERE MODEL CARDS AND SOMETIMES

01:11:48.437 --> 01:11:49.371
PEOPLE HAVE CALLED THEM

01:11:49.438 --> 01:11:51.674
NUTRITION LABELS FOR DATASETS OR

01:11:51.740 --> 01:11:53.642
NUTRITION LABELS FOR MODELS SO

01:11:53.709 --> 01:11:55.010
THE SAME WAY AS YOU CAN SAY THIS

01:11:55.077 --> 01:11:56.845
HAS YOU KNOW AX GRAMS OF FAT OR

01:11:56.912 --> 01:11:57.312
SUGAR.

OR VITAMIN A AND WE'VE BEEN

01:11:59.081 --> 01:12:01.216
WORKING TO TRY TO SAY OKAY FOR

01:12:01.283 --> 01:12:02.051
THESE DATA SETS THAT WE'VE

01:12:02.117 --> 01:12:03.052
LEARNED FROM YOU LET'S SAY IT'S

01:12:03.118 --> 01:12:04.186
AN IMAGE DATA SET WHAT

01:12:04.253 --> 01:12:05.254
PERCENTAGE ARE ANIMALS WHAT

01:12:05.320 --> 01:12:06.455
PERCENTAGE OUR CARS WHAT

01:12:06.522 --> 01:12:07.956
PERCENTAGE OUR FOOD JUST TO GIVE

01:12:08.023 --> 01:12:09.658
PEOPLE A SENSE OF WHAT'S INSIDE.

01:12:09.725 --> 01:12:10.626
WHERE DID THE DATA COME FROM

01:12:10.693 --> 01:12:13.529

01:12:15.798 --> 01:12:16.899
OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD?

01:12:16.965 --> 01:12:18.567
AND WE'VE BEEN REALLY WORKING TO

01:12:18.634 --> 01:12:19.702
TRY TO PUT TOGETHER THESE%

01:12:19.768 --> 01:12:21.270
NUTRITION LABELS WE'VE TESTED A

01:12:21.336 --> 01:12:23.238
FEW ALREADY WE PUBLISHED. ONE

01:12:23.305 --> 01:12:24.673
ONLINE FOR AN IMAGE DATA SET

01:12:24.740 --> 01:12:25.607
THAT WE HAVE AND WE'RE REALLY

01:12:25.674 --> 01:12:27.710
WORKING TO DO MORE IN THAT AREA

01:12:27.776 --> 01:12:29.011
THE SAME THING FOR MODEL'S WE

01:12:29.078 --> 01:12:30.112
FEEL LIKE THIS IS AT LEAST A

01:12:30.179 --> 01:12:31.480
GOOD START TO PROVIDING SOME

01:12:31.547 --> 01:12:32.815
TRANSPARENCY.

01:12:32.881 --> 01:12:34.283
SO FOR THESE MODELS HOW DO THEY

01:12:34.349 --> 01:12:35.918
WORK WHAT IS THEIR PERFORMANCE

01:12:35.984 --> 01:12:36.385
ON DIFFERENT TYPES OF

01:12:36.452 --> 01:12:38.087
POPULATIONS WHAT IS THEIR

01:12:38.153 --> 01:12:40.155
PERFORMANCE I'M YOU KNOW WHAT IS

01:12:40.222 --> 01:12:41.990
THEIR ERROR RATES -- WHERE DOES

01:12:42.057 --> 01:12:43.559
THE MODEL FEEL WE'RE SHOULD

01:12:43.625 --> 01:12:45.427
PROBABLY NOT BE USED ON WE'VE

01:12:45.494 --> 01:12:47.162
GOTTEN ONE EXAMPLE AS WELL OF A

01:12:47.229 --> 01:12:48.363
MODEL CARD WHICH WE POSTED

01:12:48.430 --> 01:12:50.132
ONLINE WE'RE LOOKING TO DO MANY

01:12:50.199 --> 01:12:50.632
MORE?

01:12:50.699 --> 01:12:51.767
WE'VE GOT A TEST THESE IDEAS

01:12:51.834 --> 01:12:53.035
BECAUSE WE ALSO DON'T KNOW IF

01:12:53.102 --> 01:12:54.002
WE'VE GOT ALL THE RIGHT

01:12:54.069 --> 01:12:58.240
CATEGORIES ARE ALL THE RIGHT

01:12:58.307 --> 01:13:01.276
INFORMATION ON BUT WE THINK.

01:13:01.343 --> 01:13:01.877
MAY NOT INDUSTRY COULD REALLY

01:13:01.944 --> 01:13:02.945
MOVE TOWARDS SO -- IT AND WE

01:13:03.011 --> 01:13:03.512
DON'T NEED TO GET INTO THIS

01:13:03.579 --> 01:13:04.179
TODAY BUT ALL THREE OF US SIT ON

01:13:04.246 --> 01:13:04.780
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE AN ISSUE

01:13:04.847 --> 01:13:05.714
THAT WE'RE WRESTLING WITH THIS

01:13:05.781 --> 01:13:08.050
PRIVACY TRANSPARENCY.

01:13:08.117 --> 01:13:09.685
THE RELATIONSHIP SO I I KNOW

01:13:09.752 --> 01:13:12.254
THAT GOOGLE'S ALREADY AWARE OF

01:13:12.321 --> 01:13:13.655
OF OUR INTEREST IN.

01:13:13.722 --> 01:13:17.793
OUR COLLECTIVE CONCERNED SO --

01:13:17.860 --> 01:13:19.795
ALL RIGHT OTHER QUESTIONS.

01:13:19.862 --> 01:13:23.465
IS THE SERVER JUST INCIDENT WHEN

01:13:23.532 --> 01:13:23.966
SENATOR RUSSELL.

01:13:24.032 --> 01:13:25.768
YOU KNOW I THINK -- PREVIOUS

01:13:25.834 --> 01:13:27.202
CAPACITIES OF COME TO KIND OF

01:13:27.269 --> 01:13:28.570
PUSH IT DIFFERENT ROLES THAT

01:13:28.637 --> 01:13:33.208
GOVERNMENT AND INDUSTRY HAVE --

01:13:33.275 --> 01:13:36.011
AB AT AT FIRST BLUSH MIGHT LOOK

01:13:36.078 --> 01:13:39.381
UPON INDUSTRY AS A PROFIT MOTIVE

01:13:39.448 --> 01:13:42.651
A MOTIVATED -- ADVANCE ADVANCING

01:13:42.718 --> 01:13:45.821
THE AREAS STUDY OR LEARNING --

01:13:45.888 --> 01:13:47.489
GOVERNMENTS HOWEVER HAVE A

01:13:47.556 --> 01:13:49.591
DIFFERENT SET OF PRIORITIES --

01:13:49.658 --> 01:13:52.294
STRATEGIC BEING ONE OF THEM.

01:13:52.361 --> 01:13:53.896
AND SO MY QUESTION TO YOU IS.

01:13:53.962 --> 01:13:55.264
DO YOU DOES GOOGLE HAVE ANY

01:13:55.330 --> 01:13:58.534
RECOMMENDATIONS ON HOW.

01:13:58.600 --> 01:13:59.835
THE LEGISLATURE OR THE CITY

01:13:59.902 --> 01:14:02.538
CALIFORNIA THROUGH THE EXECUTIVE.

01:14:02.604 --> 01:14:05.107
CAN LISTEN TO WHAT ARE THE

01:14:05.174 --> 01:14:07.075
RECOMMENDATIONS OF INDUSTRY

01:14:07.142 --> 01:14:09.077
WE'VE HEARD FROM A LITTLE HOOVER

01:14:09.144 --> 01:14:10.746
COMMISSION SO ON AND SO FORTH.

01:14:10.813 --> 01:14:12.447
HOW DOES CALIFORNIA HOW DOES

01:14:12.514 --> 01:14:13.482
AMERICA BUT SPECIFICALLY

01:14:13.549 --> 01:14:14.583
CALIFORNIA?

01:14:14.650 --> 01:14:16.552
HOW DO WE CATCH UP TO WHERE WE

01:14:16.618 --> 01:14:21.023
SHOULD BE WHERE WE WANT TO BE?

01:14:21.089 --> 01:14:22.324
DâN.

01:14:22.391 --> 01:14:23.625
ARE THERE CERTAIN REGULATIONS

01:14:23.692 --> 01:14:24.960
THAT ARE BETTER CREATING --

01:14:25.027 --> 01:14:27.329
DIFFICULTY ARE THERE CERTAIN

01:14:27.396 --> 01:14:28.730
INDUSTRY INCENTIVES.

01:14:28.797 --> 01:14:31.767
AND COORDINATION -- THAT -- WE

01:14:31.834 --> 01:14:33.735
CAN BE A PART OF ANY VERY

01:14:33.802 --> 01:14:35.938
SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS YES AND

PAPER ON THIS SO HAPPY TO SHARE

01:14:39.308 --> 01:14:39.808
THAT.

01:14:39.875 --> 01:14:41.276
I WAS CAN YOU AFTERWARDS IT'S

01:14:41.343 --> 01:14:42.845
GOT A LOT OF DETAILS IN THERE --

01:14:42.911 --> 01:14:44.479
I WOULD SAY -- IN TERMS OF

01:14:44.546 --> 01:14:46.148
SPECIFIC I'LL JUST NAME THREE

01:14:46.215 --> 01:14:47.783
RIGHT HERE ON THE FIRST IS

01:14:47.850 --> 01:14:49.117
REALLY IN TERMS OF CALIFORNIA

01:14:49.184 --> 01:14:51.286
INVESTING CATCHING UP I'M REALLY

01:14:51.353 --> 01:14:53.088
AND I THINK BEING ABLE TO MAKE

01:14:53.155 --> 01:14:55.324
THOSE INVESTMENTS IN STUDENTS.

01:14:55.390 --> 01:14:57.492
I AND AND YOU KNOW WHETHER IT'S

01:14:57.559 --> 01:15:00.829
K. THROUGH TWELVE AT THE COLLEGE

01:15:00.896 --> 01:15:01.697
LEVEL.

01:15:01.763 --> 01:15:02.865
OR EVEN AT THE GRADUATE LEVEL

01:15:02.931 --> 01:15:03.599
AND WHAT DO THOSE INVESTMENTS

01:15:03.665 --> 01:15:04.299
LOOK LIKE WHAT ARE THE RIGHT

01:15:04.366 --> 01:15:05.834
TYPES OF EDUCATION THAT STUDENTS

01:15:05.901 --> 01:15:07.436
SHOULD BE LEARNING WE THINK OF

01:15:07.502 --> 01:15:09.438
COURSE TEMAS IMPORTANT COMPUTER

01:15:09.504 --> 01:15:10.239
SCIENCE IS IMPORTANT.

01:15:10.305 --> 01:15:12.007
AND YOU KNOW MACHINE LEARNING IS

01:15:12.074 --> 01:15:13.375
IMPORTANT BUT EVEN MORE THE

01:15:13.442 --> 01:15:14.676
ABILITY TO LEARN TO LEARN THE

01:15:14.743 --> 01:15:16.144
ABILITY TO ADOPT WHAT DO THE

01:15:16.211 --> 01:15:18.380
SPECIFIC COURSEWORK LOOK LIKE

01:15:18.447 --> 01:15:19.748
I'M NOT SOMETHING THAT WE'VE

01:15:19.815 --> 01:15:22.885
OUTLINED IN IN.

01:15:22.951 --> 01:15:25.020
HE TELLS YOU AS USEFUL IN TERMS

01:15:25.087 --> 01:15:27.589
OF NUMBER TUNE TALKED ABOUT SOME

01:15:27.656 --> 01:15:28.957
REGULATIONS A BEGINNING THE WAY.

01:15:29.024 --> 01:15:30.592
AND WE'VE BEEN WORKING A LOT

01:15:30.659 --> 01:15:31.560
WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ON

01:15:31.627 --> 01:15:33.161
ON HIP A REFORM WE'VE TALKED A

01:15:33.228 --> 01:15:34.529
LOT WITH CALIFORNIA STATE AS

01:15:34.596 --> 01:15:36.498
WELL UCSF AND SOME OF THE OTHERS.

01:15:36.565 --> 01:15:38.100
YOU KNOW WITH SO MUCH PROMISE IN

01:15:38.166 --> 01:15:40.202
THE MEDICAL FIELD THERE'S ALSO A

01:15:40.269 --> 01:15:41.803
LOT OF ROADBLOCKS IN TERMS OF

01:15:41.870 --> 01:15:43.906
BEING ABLE TO LEARN FROM PATIENT

01:15:43.972 --> 01:15:46.174
DATA AND IN TERMS OF BEING ABLE

01:15:46.241 --> 01:15:47.509
TO ADEQUATELY PROTECT PATIENT

01:15:47.576 --> 01:15:48.810
DATA WALL MACHINE LEARNING

01:15:48.877 --> 01:15:52.047
MODELS ARE ABLE -- TO KIND OF

01:15:52.114 --> 01:15:54.216
SURVEY AN ENSEMBLE OF RECORDS TO

01:15:54.283 --> 01:15:54.783
MAKE BETTER PREDICTIONS FOR

01:15:54.850 --> 01:15:56.885
EVERYBODY -- COULD I THINK ALL

01:15:56.952 --> 01:15:58.921
AGREE IN LONG RUN THAT KIND OF

01:15:58.987 --> 01:16:00.589
THING WOULD BE VERY USEFUL --

01:16:00.656 --> 01:16:01.790
TERMS OF PREDICTING DISEASE

01:16:01.857 --> 01:16:03.692
EARLIER SAVING MONEY ON

01:16:03.759 --> 01:16:05.093
PROMOTING HEALTH YOUR LIFE'S BUT

01:16:05.160 --> 01:16:06.895
THERE ARE A LOT OF NEEDS TO BE

WORKED OUT THERE.

01:16:08.196 --> 01:16:10.432
AND SO I WOULD SAY LOOKING AT AT

01:16:10.499 --> 01:16:11.867
HEALTH CARE LEGISLATION LOOKING

01:16:11.934 --> 01:16:13.502
ACCESS TO DATA LOOKING AT

01:16:13.568 --> 01:16:14.436
PROTECTIONS FOR DATA WOULD BE IN

01:16:14.503 --> 01:16:15.504
THE AREA THAT.

I'M IS QUITE IMPORTANT -- AND

01:16:17.873 --> 01:16:20.909
THEN THE THIRD I WOULD SAY AT IS

01:16:20.976 --> 01:16:22.377
REALLY JUST THINKING ABOUT.

01:16:22.444 --> 01:16:24.613
I'M HOW GOVERNMENTS CAN PROMOTE

01:16:24.680 --> 01:16:26.815

TECHNOLOGY BUT ARE WE EXCITED AS

01:18:45.921 --> 01:18:48.256
FAR AS WHAT IT BRINGS TO OUR

01:18:48.323 --> 01:18:49.591
FUTURE.

01:18:49.658 --> 01:18:53.061
AS THE FUTURE CAREERS AND FUTURE

01:18:53.128 --> 01:18:56.098
WORK FORCE FUTURE NEEDS SO JUST

01:18:56.164 --> 01:18:57.866
ANY THOUGHTS ABOUT THAT OR HOW

01:18:57.933 --> 01:18:59.534
WE COULD TACKLE THAT BECAUSE I

01:18:59.601 --> 01:19:00.035
DON'T.

01:19:00.102 --> 01:19:01.236
THINK ANYBODY HAS THE EXACT

01:19:01.303 --> 01:19:03.672
ANSWER YEAH DEFINITELY THIS IS

01:19:03.738 --> 01:19:04.773
SOMETHING WHERE A LOT OF

01:19:04.840 --> 01:19:06.108
DIFFERENT TEAMS NEED TO PUT

01:19:06.174 --> 01:19:07.209
THEIR HEADS TOGETHER.

01:19:07.275 --> 01:19:08.510
I'M FROM GOOGLE I'D SAY WE DO

01:19:08.577 --> 01:19:09.911
YOU THINK ABOUT THIS A LOT YOU

01:19:09.978 --> 01:19:11.113
POINTED OUT THAT WE'VE GOT OUR

01:19:11.179 --> 01:19:12.981
PRINCIPLES WE SAY A I SHOULD BE

01:19:13.048 --> 01:19:14.049
SOCIALLY BENEFICIAL.

01:19:14.116 --> 01:19:15.550
WE ALSO POINT OUT IN OUR RED

01:19:15.617 --> 01:19:16.952
LINES OF APPLICATIONS WE WILL

01:19:17.018 --> 01:19:18.487
NOT PURSUE WE WON'T PURSUE

01:19:18.553 --> 01:19:19.654
APPLICATIONS THAT ARE LIKELY TO

01:19:19.721 --> 01:19:22.023
CAUSE OVERALL HARM WE PUT THIS

01:19:22.090 --> 01:19:23.158
ONE IN THERE IT'S QUITE.

01:19:23.225 --> 01:19:25.560
AN I THINK BROUGHT SO THAT WE

01:19:25.627 --> 01:19:27.629
ARE ABLE TO MAKE DECISIONS AS TO

01:19:27.696 --> 01:19:29.131
CIVIC THINGS COME UP OFTENTIMES

01:19:29.197 --> 01:19:30.532
PEOPLE THINK.

01:19:30.599 --> 01:19:32.534
PHYSICAL HARM OR AND MAYBE

01:19:32.601 --> 01:19:34.569
SAFETY AT IT MAYBE M. CHEMICAL

01:19:34.636 --> 01:19:36.004
HARM THINGS LIKE THAT WE'VE ALSO

01:19:36.071 --> 01:19:37.939
INCLUDED IN THAT NOTION ECONOMIC

01:19:38.006 --> 01:19:39.808
HARM SOCIETAL HARM SO THAT IS

01:19:39.875 --> 01:19:43.912
SOMETHING THAT WE ABSOLUTELY

01:19:43.979 --> 01:19:44.713
THINK ABOUT.

01:19:44.779 --> 01:19:45.647
I JOIN GOOGLE IN TWENTY FOURTEEN

01:19:45.714 --> 01:19:46.314
IN THE FALL SO ALMOST FIVE YEARS

01:19:46.381 --> 01:19:48.316
AGO AND IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE

01:19:48.383 --> 01:19:50.051
THE COMPANY HAS CHANGED A LOT

01:19:50.118 --> 01:19:51.219
SINCE THAT TIME.

01:19:51.286 --> 01:19:52.521
WHEN I FIRST JOINED ACTUALLY

01:19:52.587 --> 01:19:54.523
ONLY A SMALL FRACTION OF EVEN

01:19:54.589 --> 01:19:56.191
ENGINEERS HAD MACHINE LEARNING

01:19:56.258 --> 01:19:57.959
TRAINING I'M THAT'S COMPLETELY

01:19:58.026 --> 01:19:59.528
DIFFERENT TODAY WE'VE HAD MORE

01:19:59.594 --> 01:20:01.196
THAN THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND

01:20:01.263 --> 01:20:02.297
ENGINEERS GO THROUGH MACHINE

01:20:02.364 --> 01:20:03.832
LEARNING TRAINING COMPANY?

01:20:03.899 --> 01:20:05.534
SO EVEN WITHIN THE MICROCOSM OF

01:20:05.600 --> 01:20:07.035
GOOGLE I SEE PEOPLE'S JOBS HAVE

01:20:07.102 --> 01:20:09.237
CHANGED YOU THE SKILLS THAT

01:20:09.304 --> 01:20:09.871
THEY'VE DEVELOPED HAVE HAD TO

01:20:09.938 --> 01:20:11.673
CHANGE AND YOU KNOW MAYBE A LOT

01:20:11.740 --> 01:20:13.241
OF TIME FIVE YEARS AGO USED TO

01:20:13.308 --> 01:20:14.843
DO A LOT OF HAND PROGRAMMING AS

01:20:14.910 --> 01:20:15.677
I WAS MENTIONING.

01:20:15.744 --> 01:20:16.945
EARLIER NOW IT'S A LOT MORE

01:20:17.012 --> 01:20:18.346
COACHING AND TRAINING AND

01:20:18.413 --> 01:20:20.749
LEARNING FROM EXAMPLE AND SO

01:20:20.815 --> 01:20:21.783
THOSE TYPES OF JOBS.

01:20:21.850 --> 01:20:23.084
HAVE CHANGED WE'VE HAD PEOPLE

01:20:23.151 --> 01:20:24.286
FROM ALL SORTS OF OTHER

01:20:24.352 --> 01:20:26.087
FUNCTIONS TO LEGALSALES

01:20:26.154 --> 01:20:27.923
BUSINESS ETCETERA I'M HAPPY WITH

01:20:27.989 --> 01:20:28.890
YOUR MACHINE LEARNING TRAINING

01:20:28.957 --> 01:20:31.693
AS WELL TO ADAPT TO THE WAY THAT --

01:20:31.760 --> 01:20:33.195
YOU KNOW THE TECHNOLOGY AND THE

01:20:33.261 --> 01:20:35.397
COMPANY IS CHANGING I'M WE WE

01:20:35.463 --> 01:20:38.233
ANTICIPATE THIS WILL BE THE CASE

01:20:38.300 --> 01:20:39.901
IN THE OUTSIDE WORLD AS WELL I

01:20:39.968 --> 01:20:41.069
THINK WE'RE ALREADY STARTING TO

01:20:41.136 --> 01:20:41.870
SEE THAT SO.

01:20:41.937 --> 01:20:42.904
WHAT ARE WAYS THAT DIFFERENT

01:20:42.971 --> 01:20:44.773
PEOPLE'S JOBS NEED TO CHANGE

01:20:44.839 --> 01:20:46.541
INSIDE THE COMPANY I MENTIONED --

01:20:46.608 --> 01:20:47.742
WE ACTUALLY HAD AN EDUCATION

01:20:47.809 --> 01:20:49.311
TEAM THAT BUILT A MACHINE

01:20:49.377 --> 01:20:51.379
&lt;c.magenta&gt;EARNING COURSE THAT WE'VE HAD&lt;/c&gt;

01:20:51.446 --> 01:20:51.980
THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND ENGINEERS

01:20:52.047 --> 01:20:53.882
I'M GO THROUGH. TWO YEARS AGO WE

01:20:53.949 --> 01:20:55.884
OPENED THAT COURSE UP SO ANYBODY

01:20:55.951 --> 01:20:57.519
CAN TAKE IT AND IT'S IN MORE

01:20:57.586 --> 01:20:59.287
THAN ELEVEN LANGUAGES I BELIEVE

01:20:59.354 --> 01:20:59.888
RIGHT OUT.

01:20:59.955 --> 01:21:01.156
I'M SEE EXACT SAME COURSE THAT

01:21:01.223 --> 01:21:04.893
OUR OWN AND EMPLOYEES LEARN FROM.

01:21:04.960 --> 01:21:06.228
SO WE'VE OPEN THAT UP EXTERNALLY

01:21:06.294 --> 01:21:07.696
THAT SEEM EDUCATION TEAM HAS

01:21:07.762 --> 01:21:08.964
ACTUALLY LOOKED ACROSS A WIDE

01:21:09.030 --> 01:21:10.799
VARIETY RIGHT I THINK THE FIRST

01:21:10.865 --> 01:21:12.367
COURSE WAS TARGETED TOWARDS

01:21:12.434 --> 01:21:13.935
ENGINEER SPECIFICALLY.

01:21:14.002 --> 01:21:15.070
I'M BUT WE RECOGNIZE THERE'S

01:21:15.136 --> 01:21:16.204
LOADS OF DIFFERENT PEOPLE THAT

01:21:16.271 --> 01:21:17.138
ARE GONNA NEED TO LEARN THIS AND

01:21:17.205 --> 01:21:19.007
THEY MIGHT NOT NEED TO BE CODING

01:21:19.074 --> 01:21:20.709
INTENSE OUR FLOOR PYTHON OR ANY

01:21:20.775 --> 01:21:21.743
OF THOSE TYPES OF LANGUAGES

01:21:21.810 --> 01:21:23.511
MAYBE THEY JUST NEED TO LEARN

01:21:23.578 --> 01:21:24.746
HOW TO OPERATE SYSTEMS ARE.

01:21:24.813 --> 01:21:26.181
NEED TO LEARN THE BASIC CONCEPTS

01:21:26.248 --> 01:21:27.782
THAT KIND OF THING I'M SO WE'VE

01:21:27.849 --> 01:21:29.150
RELEASED A WHOLE SET OF

01:21:29.217 --> 01:21:31.686
MATERIALS CALLED LEARN WITH

01:21:31.753 --> 01:21:32.454
GOOGLE A AYE.

01:21:32.520 --> 01:21:34.122
ON OUR WEBSITE I'M AND WE'VE

01:21:34.189 --> 01:21:35.890
SEEN EVERYONE FROM ELEMENTARY

01:21:35.957 --> 01:21:38.827
SCHOOL AGE CHILDREN I'M LEARNING --

01:21:38.893 --> 01:21:40.395
FROM THE COURSES AND TAKING THEM

01:21:40.462 --> 01:21:41.830
THERE THE INTERACTIVE AND FUN

01:21:41.896 --> 01:21:43.098
ALL THE WAY UP THROUGH PEOPLE

01:21:43.164 --> 01:21:44.532
WHO ARE LOOKING AT SECOND THIRD.

01:21:44.599 --> 01:21:46.735
FOURTH CAREER SO I THINK THERE'S

01:21:46.801 --> 01:21:48.436
A LOT OF IMPORTANCE THERE IN

01:21:48.503 --> 01:21:49.571
EDUCATION.

01:21:49.638 --> 01:21:51.172
HON YOU TALKED A BIT ABOUT YOU

01:21:51.239 --> 01:21:52.707
KNOW HOW DO WE MAKE SUE THAT

01:21:52.774 --> 01:21:53.575
PEOPLE DON'T BECOME MORE

01:21:53.642 --> 01:21:55.343
OBSESSED WITH TECHNOLOGY AND

01:21:55.410 --> 01:21:56.745
MAYBE JUST MORE DRIVEN INTO

01:21:56.811 --> 01:21:58.747
PHONES AND THINGS -- I THINK

01:21:58.813 --> 01:22:00.749
THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT

01:22:00.815 --> 01:22:02.150
PERSPECTIVES ON ON A LOT OF

01:22:02.217 --> 01:22:03.051
DIFFERENT PEOPLE THAT NEED TO

01:22:03.118 --> 01:22:04.786
COME TOGETHER THEIR ONE EXAMPLE

01:22:04.853 --> 01:22:05.186
THAT.

01:22:05.253 --> 01:22:06.588
I'M I WILL GIVE FROM A GOOGLE

01:22:06.655 --> 01:22:08.290
PERSPECTIVE THOSE WE'VE SEEN USE

01:22:08.356 --> 01:22:09.591
OF MACHINE LEARNING FOR I'M

01:22:09.658 --> 01:22:11.259
ACTUALLY I'M THE CREATIVE

01:22:11.326 --> 01:22:13.261
INDUSTRY TO SPUR I'M BETTER

01:22:13.328 --> 01:22:15.664
MUSIC AND ART OR ACTUALLY MAYBE

01:22:15.730 --> 01:22:17.098
MORE DIFFERENT MUSIC AND ART SO.

01:22:17.165 --> 01:22:21.703
WE'VE BEEN PARTNERING WITH A LOT

01:22:21.770 --> 01:22:23.672
OF DIFFERENT MUSICIANS AND THE

01:22:23.738 --> 01:22:24.906
FLAMING LIPS AND THEY'VE BEEN

01:22:24.973 --> 01:22:25.707
SAYING YOU KNOW AT TIMES AS A

01:22:25.774 --> 01:22:26.641
MUSICIAN YOU KNOW WE'VE GOT LOTS

01:22:26.708 --> 01:22:28.543
OF IDEAS WE IMPROVISE WE DO.

01:22:28.610 --> 01:22:30.045
INTERESTING THINGS BUT I'M THEIR

01:22:30.111 --> 01:22:31.146
TIMES ARE WE GET A ROADBLOCK

01:22:31.212 --> 01:22:32.113
GREAT I THINK YOU HEAR ABOUT

01:22:32.180 --> 01:22:33.515
THIS FROM WRITERS TO WRITER'S

01:22:33.581 --> 01:22:36.151
BLOCK OR ARTIST NOT SURE EXACTLY.

01:22:36.217 --> 01:22:37.285
ON WHAT THEY WANT TO DO I'M

01:22:37.352 --> 01:22:38.353
WE'VE WORKED WITH THEM TO

01:22:38.420 --> 01:22:40.055
DEVELOP MACHINE LEARNING MODELS

01:22:40.121 --> 01:22:41.489
TRAINED ON BARKER TREE NON

01:22:41.556 --> 01:22:42.924
MOZART OR MAYBE TRAIN ON FLAMING

01:22:42.991 --> 01:22:43.858
LIPS.

01:22:43.925 --> 01:22:45.527
AND SONGS OR COMBINATION ON

01:22:45.593 --> 01:22:46.728
CREATING KIND OF DIFFERENT

01:22:46.795 --> 01:22:47.829
INSTRUMENT SOUNDS THAT DON'T

01:22:47.896 --> 01:22:50.098
EXIST NOW -- BUT THEY CAN USE IT

01:22:50.165 --> 01:22:50.665
AND PLAY AROUND WITH IT TO

01:22:50.732 --> 01:22:52.934
ACTUALLY JUST GET NEW IDEAS

01:22:53.001 --> 01:22:54.436
BURKE KIND OF CREATIVITY ARE

01:22:54.502 --> 01:22:55.403
LIKE WHO I NEVER THOUGHT OF

01:22:55.470 --> 01:22:56.705
THOSE NOTES IN COMBINATION

01:22:56.771 --> 01:22:57.672
TOGETHER BEFORE THOSE

01:22:57.739 --> 01:22:59.007
INSTRUMENTS OR THAT TYPE OF

01:22:59.074 --> 01:23:00.208
RHYTHM AND THEN THEY'VE BEEN

01:23:00.275 --> 01:23:01.810
ABLE TO TAKE THAT RIFF OFF OF IT.

01:23:01.876 --> 01:23:03.178
AND COME UP WITH NEW SONGS NEW

01:23:03.244 --> 01:23:05.347
PERFORMANCES AND SO I THINK

01:23:05.413 --> 01:23:07.082
THAT'S JUST ONE EXAMPLE OF ON

01:23:07.148 --> 01:23:08.850
THE WAY THAT AND MAYBE THIS

01:23:08.917 --> 01:23:10.352
COULD HELP TRANSFORM A LOT OF

01:23:10.418 --> 01:23:12.320
PARTS OF SOCIETY -- WHAT SEEMS

01:23:12.387 --> 01:23:13.588
TO UNDERSCORE ALL OF IT IS

01:23:13.655 --> 01:23:14.689
YOU'VE GOT TO GET LOTS OF

01:23:14.756 --> 01:23:15.924
DIFFERENT PEOPLE INVOLVED IT

01:23:15.990 --> 01:23:17.859
CAN'T JUST BE ONE COMPANY OR ONE

01:23:17.926 --> 01:23:19.661
INDUSTRY SAYING THIS IS WHAT WE

01:23:19.728 --> 01:23:21.162
THINK THE FUTURE LOOKS LIKE?

01:23:21.229 --> 01:23:22.964
EDUCATION IS A KEY PART OF THAT

01:23:23.031 --> 01:23:24.666
BUT SO IS PARTICIPATION I THINK

01:23:24.733 --> 01:23:25.600
A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE DIFFERENT

01:23:25.667 --> 01:23:27.035
INTERESTS AND DIFFERENT VIEWS OF

01:23:27.102 --> 01:23:28.136
WHAT THE FUTURE LOOK LIKE IF

01:23:28.203 --> 01:23:29.504
THEY ALL HAVE A GOOD

01:23:29.571 --> 01:23:30.038
UNDERSTANDING OF MACHINE

01:23:30.105 --> 01:23:31.940
LEARNING -- I THINK WE MIGHT BE

01:23:32.006 --> 01:23:34.676
ABLE TO BUILD THAT SOCIETY AND

01:23:34.743 --> 01:23:41.249
THAT'S A BIT BETTER -- AND AGAIN

01:23:41.316 --> 01:23:42.717
WHATEVER YOU MIGHT HAVE

01:23:42.784 --> 01:23:45.353
INITIALLY AS YOUR RESPONSE AND

01:23:45.420 --> 01:23:47.122
IN ANY -- DIRECTION THAT YOU

01:23:47.188 --> 01:23:48.089
COULD GIVE US ON THIS IS.

01:23:48.156 --> 01:23:50.125
HOW AS WE MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS?

01:23:50.191 --> 01:23:52.761
BIG CHANGE IN OUR WORLD.

01:23:52.827 --> 01:23:55.063
HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT IT IS?

01:23:55.130 --> 01:23:57.365
EQUITABLY.

01:23:57.432 --> 01:24:00.568
LEARNED AND TAUGHT.

01:24:00.635 --> 01:24:01.936
BUT THROUGHOUT THE WORLD AND

01:24:02.003 --> 01:24:03.571
THROUGHOUT OUR COMMUNITIES SO IT

01:24:03.638 --> 01:24:06.474
DOESN'T BECOME SOMETHING THAT A

01:24:06.541 --> 01:24:08.042
VERY ELITE GROUP OF PEOPLE.

01:24:08.109 --> 01:24:09.944
KNOW HOW TO AND I DON'T MEAN THE

01:24:10.011 --> 01:24:11.446
USE OF IT.

01:24:11.513 --> 01:24:12.614
YEAH THE USE OF IT.

01:24:12.680 --> 01:24:14.616
EVERYBODY SEEMS TO EVEN I CAN

01:24:14.682 --> 01:24:16.785
PICK UP OF THE USE OF A LOT OF

01:24:16.851 --> 01:24:18.586
THIS TECHNOLOGY I'M TALKING

01:24:18.653 --> 01:24:20.255
ABOUT THE CREATED THE THAT

01:24:20.321 --> 01:24:23.758
CREATORS -- BECAUSE THAT'S WERE

01:24:23.825 --> 01:24:25.760
REAL STRENGTH IS YEAH IT'S IT'S

01:24:25.827 --> 01:24:27.295
NOT JUST IN THE USERS THE

01:24:27.362 --> 01:24:28.430
PASSIVE.

01:24:28.496 --> 01:24:30.832
UP PART OF IT IT'S WHAT ABOUT

01:24:30.899 --> 01:24:31.933
THE CREATOR SO.

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:33.134
IT REALLY I THINK IT'S REALLY

01:24:33.201 --> 01:24:35.036
IMPORTANT FOR COMPANIES LIKE

01:24:35.103 --> 01:24:37.972
GOOGLE. TO BE ESPECIALLY

01:24:38.039 --> 01:24:41.176
VIGILANT AND PRO ACTIVE.

01:24:41.242 --> 01:24:43.945
IN MAKING SURE THAT.

01:24:44.012 --> 01:24:48.516
OF THE THE FRONT END THE FRONT.

01:24:48.583 --> 01:24:51.820
PART YES -- THIS NEW LEARNING

01:24:51.886 --> 01:24:55.957
AND TECHNOLOGY AND AND AI.

01:24:56.024 --> 01:24:58.693
IS REALLY TAKEN EQUALLY OUT OUR

01:24:58.760 --> 01:25:00.128
COMMUNITIES AND THROUGHOUT

01:25:00.195 --> 01:25:01.162
DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE WORLD

01:25:01.229 --> 01:25:02.630
THIS OTHERWISE WE JUST

01:25:02.697 --> 01:25:04.299
PERPETUATING.

01:25:04.365 --> 01:25:09.804
A LOT OF YOU KNOW BAD ECONOMICS --

01:25:09.871 --> 01:25:13.107
SEGREGATION IN YOU KNOW IN THE

01:25:13.174 --> 01:25:16.644
BIG USE OF OF THE TERM SO I GET

01:25:16.711 --> 01:25:19.481
REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT THAT --

01:25:19.547 --> 01:25:20.114
THAT.

01:25:20.181 --> 01:25:22.750
WERE JUST NOT MAKING SURE.

01:25:22.817 --> 01:25:24.085
IT'S GETTING OUT THERE AND IT'S

01:25:24.152 --> 01:25:26.321
ADVANCING SO MUCH.

01:25:26.387 --> 01:25:27.989
AND MANY COMMUNITIES ARE GETTING

01:25:28.056 --> 01:25:29.424
LEFT BEHIND MANY COUNTRIES ARE

01:25:29.491 --> 01:25:31.526
GETTING LEFT BEHIND SO.

01:25:31.593 --> 01:25:32.627
HOW DOES GOOGLE ADDRESS THAT

01:25:32.694 --> 01:25:33.294
YEAH?

01:25:33.361 --> 01:25:34.762
I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT

01:25:34.829 --> 01:25:36.664
WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT AS WELL I

01:25:36.731 --> 01:25:37.465
MENTIONED IT A LITTLE BIT

01:25:37.532 --> 01:25:38.399
EARLIER.

01:25:38.466 --> 01:25:40.535
IN MY REMARKS ON SO COUPLE OF

01:25:40.602 --> 01:25:42.770
DIFFERENT POINTS ONE IS ACTUALLY

01:25:42.837 --> 01:25:45.073
COMPARED TO EARLIER TECHNOLOGIES

01:25:45.139 --> 01:25:46.574
THAT HAVE EXISTED IF YOU LOOK AT

01:25:46.641 --> 01:25:47.809
AND MAYBE CHEMISTRY OR

01:25:47.876 --> 01:25:49.544
BIOTECHNOLOGY OR SOME OF THE

01:25:49.611 --> 01:25:50.178
OTHERS.

01:25:50.245 --> 01:25:51.846
AND YOU KNEW THAT THE BARRIER TO

01:25:51.913 --> 01:25:52.714
ENTRY FOR ARTIFICIAL

01:25:52.780 --> 01:25:54.015
INTELLIGENCE IS ACTUALLY QUITE A

01:25:54.082 --> 01:25:55.517
BIT LOWER YOU DON'T ACTUALLY

01:25:55.583 --> 01:25:57.619
NEED A FANCY LAB OR ACCESS TO

01:25:57.685 --> 01:25:59.120
EXPENSIVE CHEMICALS.

01:25:59.187 --> 01:26:01.823
OR BIG MACHINES LIKE IN NUCLEAR

01:26:01.890 --> 01:26:03.558
MAGNETIC RESONANCE OR OR X. RAYS

01:26:03.625 --> 01:26:04.559
ARE MICROSCOPES OR THINGS LIKE

01:26:04.626 --> 01:26:05.994
THAT THE BARRIER TO ENTRY

01:26:06.060 --> 01:26:08.396
ACTUALLY FOR ANYBODY TO LEARN

01:26:08.463 --> 01:26:09.797
HOW TO CODE IS MAYBE.

01:26:09.864 --> 01:26:12.467
A LAPTOP WERE ON A PHONE --

01:26:12.534 --> 01:26:13.868
THERE'S LOTS OF MACHINE LEARNING

01:26:13.935 --> 01:26:15.703
MODELS ACTUALLY OPERATE DIRECTLY

01:26:15.770 --> 01:26:20.341
ON PHONE I'M WE'VE ACTUALLY I'M.

01:26:20.408 --> 01:26:21.075
L. AMONG OTHERS BEEN PUTTING OUT

01:26:21.142 --> 01:26:21.776
SOME KIND OF TOOLS THAT ARE EVEN

01:26:21.843 --> 01:26:23.578
MADE OUT OF CARDBOARD BOXES BUT

01:26:23.645 --> 01:26:24.612
HAVE A LITTLE RASPBERRY PI

01:26:24.679 --> 01:26:25.680
CIRCUIT INSIDE.

01:26:25.747 --> 01:26:27.282
EITHER FIFTY DOLLARS THEY'RE NOT

01:26:27.348 --> 01:26:28.750
FREE BUT THEY ARE SOMETHING

01:26:28.816 --> 01:26:30.184
WE'RE CALLING THEM A AYE WHY

01:26:30.251 --> 01:26:31.753
KIDS THE SAME IDEAS LIKE D. I.

01:26:31.819 --> 01:26:34.389
Y. BUT A AYE WHY SO I'M SCHOOL

01:26:34.455 --> 01:26:35.657
CHILDREN CAN ACTUALLY.

01:26:35.723 --> 01:26:37.292
BUILD THEIR OWN YOU KNOW SPEECH

01:26:37.358 --> 01:26:39.327
TO TAX OR IMAGE RECOGNITION OR

01:26:39.394 --> 01:26:40.862
THINGS LIKE THAT MODELS ON

01:26:40.929 --> 01:26:42.363
THINGS THAT ARE DONE ON PHONES

01:26:42.430 --> 01:26:43.565
OR ON COMPUTERS COULD BE

01:26:43.631 --> 01:26:45.533
VIRTUALLY FREE AS LONG AS YOU'VE

01:26:45.600 --> 01:26:46.834
GONE INTERNET CONNECTION OR

01:26:46.901 --> 01:26:48.570
ACCESS TO THE SITE SO I THINK.

01:26:48.636 --> 01:26:50.138
THE BARRIER TO ENTRY COMPARED TO

01:26:50.204 --> 01:26:51.839
PREVIOUS TECHNOLOGIES IS QUITE A

01:26:51.906 --> 01:26:52.740
BIT LOWER.

01:26:52.807 --> 01:26:54.609
THAT BEING SAID PEOPLE STILL

01:26:54.676 --> 01:26:55.777
HAVE TO KNOW ABOUT HE

01:26:55.843 --> 01:26:57.111
OPPORTUNITY TO USE THESE

01:26:57.178 --> 01:26:58.880
TECHNOLOGIES AND TOOLS

01:26:58.947 --> 01:27:00.648
OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN ABOUT THEM --

01:27:00.715 --> 01:27:01.883
WORK TRYING TO DO THAT THROUGH A

01:27:01.950 --> 01:27:03.351
LOT OF DIFFERENT WAYS I TALKED

01:27:03.418 --> 01:27:04.786
ABOUT EDUCATION AND WE'VE GOT

01:27:04.852 --> 01:27:06.688
PROGRAMS IN CLASSROOMS IN THE U.

01:27:06.754 --> 01:27:08.423
S. IN CALIFORNIA AND AND AROUND

01:27:08.489 --> 01:27:09.223
THE WORLD.

01:27:09.290 --> 01:27:12.527
AND JUST IN AT LAST OCTOBER WE

01:27:12.594 --> 01:27:13.928
ANNOUNCED A CHALLENGE CALLED THE

01:27:13.995 --> 01:27:15.630
GOOGLE TWENTY FIVE MILLION

01:27:15.697 --> 01:27:17.298
DOLLARS A AYE IMPACT CHALLENGE

01:27:17.365 --> 01:27:19.167
WHERE WE PROVIDED AT AN OPEN

01:27:19.233 --> 01:27:21.803
CALL TO ANYBODY AROUND THE WORLD.

01:27:21.869 --> 01:27:22.737
TO TRY TO THINK ABOUT WAYS A I

01:27:22.804 --> 01:27:24.505
COULD ADDRESS PROBLEMS THAT

01:27:24.572 --> 01:27:26.941
THEY'RE WORKING ON JUST IN MAY

01:27:27.008 --> 01:27:28.810
SO JUST LAST MONTH WE ANNOUNCE

01:27:28.876 --> 01:27:30.244
THE WINNERS OF THOSE.

01:27:30.311 --> 01:27:32.113
I'M INCLUDING NINE FROM THE US

01:27:32.180 --> 01:27:33.314
ONE FROM ALIFORNIA.

01:27:33.381 --> 01:27:35.283
I'M REALLY LOOKING AT INNOVATIVE

01:27:35.350 --> 01:27:39.487
WAYS THAT PEOPLE CAN.

01:27:39.554 --> 01:27:40.922
USE THE TECHNOLOGY.

01:27:40.989 --> 01:27:41.556
THE TEAMS DID NOT HAVE MACHINE

01:27:41.623 --> 01:27:42.857
LEARNING EXPERIENCE OR EXPERTISE

01:27:42.924 --> 01:27:44.459
SO THEY HAD IDEAS OF HOW THEY

01:27:44.525 --> 01:27:45.994
MIGHT BE ABLE TO USE IT BUT

01:27:46.060 --> 01:27:47.862
DIDN'T HAVE HANDS ON I'M KIND OF

01:27:47.929 --> 01:27:49.530
KNOWLEDGE DATE PROPOSED THEIR

01:27:49.597 --> 01:27:50.898
IDEAS AND I WAS SOMETHING THAT

01:27:50.965 --> 01:27:51.532
WE THOUGHT WAS.

01:27:51.599 --> 01:27:53.201
I'M REALLY EXCITING WE'VE SEEN

01:27:53.267 --> 01:27:54.769
THEM ALREADY IN THE PAST FEW

01:27:54.836 --> 01:27:56.404
MONTHS MAKE SIGNIFICANT GAINS ON

01:27:56.471 --> 01:27:58.039
THEIR PROJECTS WE BROUGHT THEM

01:27:58.106 --> 01:28:00.341
INTO GOOGLE LAST MAY FOR I'M

01:28:00.408 --> 01:28:02.010
KIND OF A WHOLE WEEK WE CALLED

01:28:02.076 --> 01:28:04.178
IT A BOOT CAMP I'M TRAINING IN.

01:28:04.245 --> 01:28:05.847
MACHINE LEARNING PAIRED WITH I'M

01:28:05.913 --> 01:28:07.749
EXPERTS I'M HANDS ON MENTOR SHIP

01:28:07.815 --> 01:28:09.317
THINGS LIKE THAT BUT I THINK

01:28:09.384 --> 01:28:10.585
THEY ARE GREAT EXAMPLES AND

01:28:10.652 --> 01:28:11.853
WE'RE STARTING TO SEE A LOT OF

01:28:11.919 --> 01:28:14.889
OTHERS HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS ON

01:28:14.956 --> 01:28:15.890
PEOPLE IN AND COMMUNITIES AND

01:28:15.957 --> 01:28:16.591
OTHERS.

01:28:16.658 --> 01:28:17.759
WHO ARE LEARNING A LOT OF THIS

01:28:17.825 --> 01:28:19.027
ON THEIR OWN THROUGH THREE

01:28:19.093 --> 01:28:20.461
MATERIALS THROUGH A LITTLE BIT

01:28:20.528 --> 01:28:21.929
OF MENTORSHIP A LITTLE BIT OF

01:28:21.996 --> 01:28:23.297
HELP A LITTLE BIT OF -- SEED

01:28:23.364 --> 01:28:25.466
FUNDING SO I THINK THERE'S A LOT

01:28:25.533 --> 01:28:26.868
OF EXAMPLES OUT THERE PEOPLE WHO

01:28:26.934 --> 01:28:27.969
CAN ACTUALLY LEARN THIS THEY

01:28:28.036 --> 01:28:29.270
DON'T NEED TO BE EXPERTS DON'T

01:28:29.337 --> 01:28:30.772
NEED A PHD I'M BUT DO YOU NEED

01:28:30.838 --> 01:28:32.774
TO BE WILLING TO INVEST A LITTLE

01:28:32.840 --> 01:28:35.043
BIT OF TIME -- AND EFFORT INTO.

01:28:35.109 --> 01:28:36.978
LEARNING AND KIND OF PRACTICING

01:28:37.045 --> 01:28:39.981
BUT YEAH I THINK THERE'S A LOT

01:28:40.048 --> 01:28:40.715
OF OPPORTUNITIES HERE

COMMITTEE -- FOR THE OPPORTUNITY

01:29:55.223 --> 01:29:57.225
TO SPEAK ARE I GUESS I CAN SKIP

01:29:57.291 --> 01:29:59.894
OVER MY BIO BECAUSE YOU'VE GIVEN

01:29:59.961 --> 01:30:01.429
EVEN MORE THANI HAD PLANNED.

01:30:01.496 --> 01:30:03.731
TO OUR MY WERE QUITE IMPRESSIVE

01:30:03.798 --> 01:30:04.599
THOUGH SO THANK YOU.

01:30:04.665 --> 01:30:06.033
YEAH WELL THANK YOU -- MY WORK

01:30:06.100 --> 01:30:07.568
FOCUSES AS YOU MENTIONED ON THE

01:30:07.635 --> 01:30:09.270
NEED TO DESIGN COMPUTER SYSTEMS

01:30:09.337 --> 01:30:10.738
TO SUPPORT HUMAN VALUES SUCH AS

01:30:10.805 --> 01:30:12.573
FAIRNESS PRIVACY SECURITY AND

01:30:12.640 --> 01:30:14.442
LEGAL COMPLIANCE WHEN COMPUTERS

01:30:14.509 --> 01:30:15.777
ARE USED TO MAKE LIFE ALTERING

01:30:15.843 --> 01:30:17.278
DECISIONS SUCH AS WHO WINS AN

01:30:17.345 --> 01:30:18.012
ELECTION.

01:30:18.079 --> 01:30:19.147
WHO GETS ACCESS TO FINANCIAL

01:30:19.213 --> 01:30:21.282
PRODUCTS ARE AND WHETHER SOMEONE

01:30:21.349 --> 01:30:22.316
SHOULD BE INCARCERATED OR

01:30:22.383 --> 01:30:24.986
WHETHER A DIAGNOSTIC IMAGE SHOWS --

01:30:25.052 --> 01:30:26.387
EVIDENCE OF DISEASE.

01:30:26.454 --> 01:30:27.655
AS WE MOVE INTO A WORLD WHERE

01:30:27.722 --> 01:30:31.659
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCEINCREASES THE NUMBER STEAKS AND

01:30:31.726 --> 01:30:33.628
SPEED OF THESE DECISIONS IT IS

01:30:33.694 --> 01:30:34.962
ESSENTIAL THAT WE DESIGN SYSTEMS

01:30:35.029 --> 01:30:36.764
TO SUPPORT HUMAN VALUES AND TO

01:30:36.831 --> 01:30:38.900
BE SUBJECT TO ROBUST GOVERNANCE.

01:30:38.966 --> 01:30:40.735
SO THAT WE CAN ENSURE THAT

01:30:40.802 --> 01:30:42.436
PEOPLE AND ORGANIZATIONS.

01:30:42.503 --> 01:30:43.504
COUNTABLE FOR THEIR ACTIONS.

01:30:43.571 --> 01:30:45.139
HERE I USE THE TERM ARTIFICIAL

01:30:45.206 --> 01:30:45.973
INTELLIGENCE SLIGHTLY

01:30:46.040 --> 01:30:47.408
DIFFERENTLY THAN THE OTHER

01:30:47.475 --> 01:30:48.743
WITNESSES TO MEAN ANY BEHAVIOR

01:30:48.810 --> 01:30:50.378
BY MACHINE THAT A PERSON WOULD

01:30:50.444 --> 01:30:54.248
CONSIDER TO BE INTELLIGENT

01:30:54.315 --> 01:30:55.616
REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THAT.

01:30:55.683 --> 01:30:56.184
I WANT TO MAKE THREE POINTS

01:30:56.250 --> 01:30:57.652
TODAY.

01:30:57.718 --> 01:30:59.387
FIRST WELL THEIR MECHANICAL

01:30:59.453 --> 01:31:00.688
COMPUTERS SHOULD NOT BE

01:31:00.755 --> 01:31:02.123
CONSIDERED OBJECTIVE.

01:31:02.190 --> 01:31:03.724
SECOND THERE EXIST BOTH

BENEFITS OF TECHNOLOGY WHILE

01:31:31.619 --> 01:31:33.888
MINIMIZING HARMS. TO MY FIRST

01:31:33.955 --> 01:31:35.389
POINT ALTHOUGH COMPUTERS ARE

01:31:35.456 --> 01:31:36.991
OFTEN DESCRIBED AS MECHANICAL

01:31:37.058 --> 01:31:38.726
AND THEREFORE OBJECTIVE WE MUST

01:31:38.793 --> 01:31:40.127
UNDERSTAND THAT ALL TECHNICAL

01:31:40.194 --> 01:31:42.430
SYSTEMS ARE IN TRUTH SO SHOULD

01:31:42.496 --> 01:31:43.631
TECHNICAL SYSTEMS MEANING THEY

01:31:43.698 --> 01:31:45.600
INCLUDE PEOPLE ORGANIZATIONS

01:31:45.666 --> 01:31:47.401
INSTITUTIONS AS WELL AS LEGAL

01:31:47.468 --> 01:31:48.870
AND SOCIAL.

01:31:48.936 --> 01:31:50.171
THE IMAGINED OBJECTIVITY OF

01:31:50.238 --> 01:31:51.539
COMPUTERS DERIVES FROM THEIR

01:31:51.606 --> 01:31:53.074
MECHANICAL NATURE AND THEIR

01:31:53.140 --> 01:31:55.409
RELIANCE ON DATA ABOUT THE WORLD --

01:31:55.476 --> 01:31:56.777
BUT CHOICES ABOUT WHICH DATED TO

GATHER WHICH DATED TO USE AND

01:31:58.913 --> 01:32:00.514
THE NATURE OF THAT USE WORK

01:32:00.581 --> 01:32:02.750
TOGETHER TO CAPTURE EXISTING

INTEREST A PROBLEM KNOWN

01:32:11.025 --> 01:32:12.326
TECHNICALLY AS THE PROBLEM OF

01:32:12.393 --> 01:32:13.261
BIAS.

01:32:13.327 --> 01:32:14.629
MEASUREMENT CHOICES ARE JUST ONE

01:32:14.695 --> 01:32:16.130
EXAMPLE OF THE DESIGN CHOICES

01:32:16.197 --> 01:32:17.298
MADE WHEN AND I SYSTEMS ARE

01:32:17.365 --> 01:32:19.033
CONSTRUCTED OR DEPLOYED INTO THE

01:32:19.100 --> 01:32:19.867
WORLD.

01:32:19.934 --> 01:32:22.003
NO DECISION IS PURELY TECHNICAL

01:32:22.069 --> 01:32:23.404
OR ENTIRELY FREE OF POLITICAL

01:32:23.471 --> 01:32:24.906

01:32:25.907 --> 01:32:27.141
SHOULD BE CONSIDERED TO REVEAL

01:32:27.208 --> 01:32:28.910
OBJECTIVE TRUTH EVEN SYSTEMS

01:32:28.976 --> 01:32:29.911
THAT ARE BASED ON DATA ABOUT THE

01:32:29.977 --> 01:32:32.513
WORLD AS MANY I SYSTEMS ARE.

01:32:32.580 --> 01:32:34.649
INDEED S. SYSTEMS CAN AND DO

01:32:34.715 --> 01:32:36.117
REFLECT AND REINFORCE EXISTING

01:32:36.183 --> 01:32:37.418
SOCIAL STRUCTURES AND BIASES

01:32:37.485 --> 01:32:39.153
DISCRIMINATING AGAINST

01:32:39.220 --> 01:32:41.055
VULNERABLE PEOPLE AND OFTEN --

01:32:41.122 --> 01:32:43.124
INADVERTENTLY TREATING.

01:32:43.190 --> 01:32:45.493
GROUPS LESS WELL THAN

01:32:45.559 --> 01:32:46.794
HISTORICALLY ADVANTAGE GROUPS.

01:32:46.861 --> 01:32:48.062
MACHINES PLAY FORWARD THE

01:32:48.129 --> 01:32:49.864
POLITICAL CHOICES MADE DURING

01:32:49.931 --> 01:32:51.332
THEIR DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION.

01:32:51.399 --> 01:32:52.833
WHEN SYSTEMS ARE BASED ON

01:32:52.900 --> 01:32:53.734
HISTORICAL INFORMATION THAT

01:32:53.801 --> 01:32:55.403
REFLECTS DISCRIMINATION?

01:32:55.469 --> 01:32:56.137
THE CHOICE TO USE THIS

01:32:56.203 --> 01:32:57.338
INFORMATION REFLECTS A

01:32:57.405 --> 01:32:59.073
PARTICULAR PERSPECTIVE ON HOW

01:32:59.140 --> 01:33:00.808
SUCH SYSTEMS SHOULD WORK. FOR

01:33:00.875 --> 01:33:02.643
EXAMPLE RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT

01:33:02.710 --> 01:33:04.145
FACE DETECTION SYSTEMS WHICH

01:33:04.211 --> 01:33:05.146
IDENTIFY WHETHER A PHOTOGRAPH

01:33:05.212 --> 01:33:07.148
HAS A FACE IN IT WORK LESS WELL

01:33:07.214 --> 01:33:08.783
FOR DARK SKINNED PEOPLE THAN FOR

01:33:08.849 --> 01:33:10.518
WHITE PEOPLE AS WELL AS LESS

01:33:10.584 --> 01:33:12.420
WELL FOR WOMEN THAN FOR MEN.

01:33:12.486 --> 01:33:13.688
AND THE PERFORMANCE FOR DARK

01:33:13.754 --> 01:33:15.056
SKINNED WOMEN IS EVEN WORSE

01:33:15.122 --> 01:33:16.424
TRANSFORMING A MOSTLY FUNCTIONAL

01:33:16.490 --> 01:33:17.959
BUT OCCASIONALLY AIRING SYSTEM

01:33:18.025 --> 01:33:18.960
THAT WORKS FOR NINE OUT OF TEN

01:33:19.026 --> 01:33:21.062
PEOPLE INTO A BROKEN ONE THAT

01:33:21.128 --> 01:33:22.830
WORKS ONLY TWO FOR ONLY TWO OUT

01:33:22.897 --> 01:33:25.032
OF THREE I OTHER RESEARCH TO

01:33:25.099 --> 01:33:25.766
WHICH I CONTRIBUTED.

01:33:25.833 --> 01:33:27.034
DEMONSTRATED THE POTENTIAL FOR

01:33:27.101 --> 01:33:28.669
FALSE MATCHES IN FACE

01:33:28.736 --> 01:33:29.804
RECOGNITION SYSTEMS.

01:33:29.870 --> 01:33:32.173
WHICH ASSOCIATE AN IDENTITY WITH

01:33:32.239 --> 01:33:33.107
A DETECTIVE FACE.

01:33:33.174 --> 01:33:34.942
ARE THESE FALSE MATCHES INCLUDED

01:33:35.009 --> 01:33:36.811
NEARLY TWICE AS MANY FALSE

01:33:36.877 --> 01:33:38.579
MATCHES FOR DARK SKIN FACES AS

01:33:38.646 --> 01:33:39.547
FOR LIGHT ONCE.

01:33:39.613 --> 01:33:42.016
BOTH KINDS OF UNEQUAL FAILURE

01:33:42.083 --> 01:33:42.616
CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO A

01:33:42.683 --> 01:33:47.621
COMBINATION OF THE DESIGN

01:33:47.688 --> 01:33:48.356
EVALUATION WORK FLOWS OF THE

01:33:48.422 --> 01:33:49.390

01:33:49.457 --> 01:33:50.524
SUFFICIENTLY DIVERSE DATA.

01:33:50.591 --> 01:33:51.826
AND DECISIONS IN THE EARLY

01:33:53.494 --> 01:33:54.929
TO BUILD A AND DEVELOP CAMERAS

01:33:54.996 --> 01:33:57.064
AND FILM TECHNOLOGY THAT WOULD

01:33:57.131 --> 01:33:59.633
CAPTURE WHITE FACES ACCURATELY.

01:33:59.700 --> 01:34:01.435
EVEN IF WE STIPULATE THAT A FACE

01:34:01.502 --> 01:34:03.004
PROCESSING SYSTEM COULD WORK

01:34:03.070 --> 01:34:03.771
PERFECTLY.

01:34:03.838 --> 01:34:05.473
I ITS USE WOULD TEND TO ENABLE

01:34:05.539 --> 01:34:06.640
SURVEILLANCE AND POLICING.

01:34:06.707 --> 01:34:07.942
BOTH A PRACTICES THAT HAVE BEEN

01:34:08.009 --> 01:34:09.176
DEPLOYED HEAVILY IN THE PAST

01:34:09.243 --> 01:34:10.478
AGAINST MINORITY GROUPS FOR

01:34:10.544 --> 01:34:11.712
WHICH THE TECHNOLOGY IS ALREADY

01:34:11.779 --> 01:34:13.547
LESS ACCURATE -- SO MAKING IT

01:34:13.614 --> 01:34:14.982
MORE ACCURATE WOULD CAUSE THOSE

01:34:15.049 --> 01:34:16.817
GROUPS TO BE POLICE -- TO AND

01:34:16.884 --> 01:34:18.586
SURVEILLED MORE HEAVILY I AND A

01:34:22.523 --> 01:34:26.427
BEFORE THIS BODY AS A B..

01:34:26.494 --> 01:34:26.894
TWELVE FIFTEEN IT IS.

01:34:26.961 --> 01:34:28.696
IN A DIFFERENT CONTEXT RESEARCH

BY JOURNALISTS AT PROPUBLICA IT

01:34:30.431 --> 01:34:31.999
DEMONSTRATED THAT A TOOL USED TO

01:34:32.066 --> 01:34:34.201
ESTABLISH THE RISK OF COUNTY

01:34:34.268 --> 01:34:35.636

FUTURE CRIME AT NEARLY TWICE THE

01:34:39.573 --> 01:34:39.707
RATE.

01:34:39.774 --> 01:34:41.342

OF FUTURE REST FOR BOTH GROUPS.

01:34:45.679 --> 01:34:47.048
THIS COUNTER INTUITIVE RESULT

01:34:47.114 --> 01:34:48.182
CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO THE FACT

01:34:48.249 --> 01:34:49.216
THAT BLACK PEOPLE IN BROWARD

01:34:49.283 --> 01:34:50.384
COUNTY ARE ARRESTED AS

01:34:50.451 --> 01:34:51.719
SUBSTANTIALLY HIGHER RATE THAN

WHITE PEOPLE.

01:34:52.853 --> 01:34:53.888
MATHEMATICALLY GUARANTEEING THAT

01:34:53.954 --> 01:34:55.990
CALIBRATING RATINGS TO RISK

01:34:56.057 --> 01:34:57.291
WOULD LEAD TO UNEQUAL AIR

CALCULATED.

01:36:45.166 --> 01:36:46.734
MY SECOND POINT IS THE TECHNICAL

01:36:46.800 --> 01:36:47.968
TOOLS AND NONTECHNICAL

01:36:48.035 --> 01:36:48.969
INTERVENTIONS CAN HELP US

01:36:49.036 --> 01:36:50.771
CONSTRUCT SOFTWARE THAT IS

01:36:50.838 --> 01:36:51.472
RELIABLE.

01:36:51.539 --> 01:36:55.109
BOTH FIT FOR PURPOSE AND SOME.

01:36:55.176 --> 01:36:56.610
THIS REQUIRES A PARADIGM SHIFT

01:36:56.677 --> 01:36:58.078
AWAY FROM A MINDSET THAT WE

01:36:58.145 --> 01:36:59.313
BUILD COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND ONLY

01:36:59.380 --> 01:37:01.415
THEN ASSESS THEIR IMPACTS ON

01:37:01.482 --> 01:37:02.950
SOCIAL AND POLITICAL VALUES.

01:37:03.017 --> 01:37:04.418
I AND THEN CONSIDER MODIFYING

01:37:04.485 --> 01:37:06.120
THEM BASED ON THAT ASSESSMENT.

01:37:06.187 --> 01:37:07.454
INSTEAD THE SYSTEMS MUST BE

01:37:07.521 --> 01:37:08.889
DESIGNED FROM THE START TO

01:37:08.956 --> 01:37:10.691
REFLECT OUR VALUES IN THEIR

01:37:10.758 --> 01:37:12.226
REQUIREMENTS REQUIREMENTS ARE

01:37:12.293 --> 01:37:13.360
CRITERIA ESTABLISHED AT THE

01:37:13.427 --> 01:37:14.695
BEGINNING OF A SYSTEMS LIFECYCLE

01:37:14.762 --> 01:37:15.663
DESCRIBING WHAT IT SHOULD AND

01:37:15.729 --> 01:37:16.997
SHOULD NOT DO.

01:37:17.064 --> 01:37:19.800
I AND EXPLICITLY INCLUDING THESE.

01:37:19.867 --> 01:37:21.969
GOALS AND CONSTRAINTS SUCH AS

01:37:22.036 --> 01:37:23.704
PROTECTING PRIVACY OR ADVANCING

01:37:23.771 --> 01:37:24.371
FAIRNESS.

01:37:24.438 --> 01:37:26.140
COMMON INDUSTRY PRACTICES SUCH

01:37:26.207 --> 01:37:27.675
AS SOFTWARE TESTING CODE REVIEW

01:37:27.741 --> 01:37:29.376
AN EXPLICIT TRACKING BUGS ALL

01:37:29.443 --> 01:37:30.511
SERVE TO IMPROVE SECURITY

01:37:30.578 --> 01:37:33.080
RELIABILITY IN VARIOUS WAYS AND

01:37:33.147 --> 01:37:34.648
BRING US CLOSER TO THESE GOALS.

01:37:34.715 --> 01:37:36.350
BUT EVEN WITH SUCH METHODS BUGS

01:37:36.417 --> 01:37:37.851
IN VULNERABILITIES ARE PERCEIVED

01:37:37.918 --> 01:37:39.653
AS INEVITABLE.

01:37:39.720 --> 01:37:41.088
WELL NO SYSTEM CAN BE PERFECT

01:37:41.155 --> 01:37:42.623
COMPUTER SCIENCE OFFERS A SUITE

01:37:42.690 --> 01:37:43.791
OF RICHER AND MORE POWERFUL

01:37:43.857 --> 01:37:45.693
TOOLS INCLUDING CRYPTOGRAPHY

01:37:45.759 --> 01:37:46.994
SUFFER VERIFICATION.

01:37:47.061 --> 01:37:48.329
AND MATHEMATICAL UNDERSTANDINGS

01:37:48.395 --> 01:37:49.096
OF THE CAPABILITIES AND

01:37:49.163 --> 01:37:50.698
LIMITATIONS OF MACHINE LEARNING

01:37:50.764 --> 01:37:51.966
TECHNOLOGIES.

01:37:52.032 --> 01:37:53.901
ALL OF THESE SUPPORT STRONGER

01:37:53.968 --> 01:37:55.135
CLAIMS ABOUT THE RELIABILITY

01:37:55.202 --> 01:37:56.237
FITNESS FOR PURPOSE AND

01:37:56.303 --> 01:37:58.172
PRESERVATION OF VALUES SUCH AS

01:37:58.239 --> 01:38:00.174
PRIVACY SECURITY IN FAIRNESS IN

01:38:00.241 --> 01:38:01.108
COMPUTER SYSTEMS.

01:38:01.175 --> 01:38:03.077
OF MY OWN WORK HAS DEMONSTRATED

01:38:03.143 --> 01:38:04.345
A HOW TO BUILD ENHANCED AUDIT

01:38:04.411 --> 01:38:05.713
LOGS FOR AUTOMATED DECISION

01:38:05.779 --> 01:38:07.147
MAKING SYSTEM SO THAT CONSUMERS

01:38:07.214 --> 01:38:08.215
TO RECEIVE.

01:38:08.282 --> 01:38:10.117
SAY CREDIT SCORE CAN BE CERTAIN

01:38:10.184 --> 01:38:11.619
THAT A COMPLETE JUSTIFICATION

01:38:11.685 --> 01:38:13.621
FOR THEIR SCORE EXISTS MEANING

01:38:13.687 --> 01:38:14.488
THAT THE FORMULA FOR GENERATING

01:38:14.555 --> 01:38:16.190
SCORES REPORTED SOMEWHERE ALONG

01:38:16.257 --> 01:38:17.458
WITH THEIR CREDIT HISTORY.

01:38:17.524 --> 01:38:18.826
I AND ALONG WITH THE FACT THE

01:38:18.892 --> 01:38:20.928
FORMULA APPLIED TO THEIR

01:38:20.995 --> 01:38:22.596
PERSONAL CREDIT HISTORY

01:38:22.663 --> 01:38:23.831
GENERATES THEIR PARTICULAR SCORE.

01:38:23.897 --> 01:38:25.599
THESE TOOLS CAN ALSO BE USED TO

01:38:25.666 --> 01:38:26.333
DEMONSTRATE THAT THE SAME

01:38:26.400 --> 01:38:27.968
DECISION POLICY FOR EXAMPLE THE

01:38:28.035 --> 01:38:29.536
SAME CREDIT SCORING FORMULAS

01:38:29.603 --> 01:38:30.571
APPLIED TO EVERYONE.

01:38:30.638 --> 01:38:31.772
ALL THIS IS POSSIBLE WHILE

01:38:31.839 --> 01:38:33.173
PRESERVING THE PROPRIETARY

01:38:33.240 --> 01:38:34.808
NATURE OF THE DECISION POLICY

01:38:34.875 --> 01:38:35.976
FOR EXAMPLE THE SECRECY OF THE

01:38:36.043 --> 01:38:38.145
CREDIT SCORING FORM.

01:38:38.212 --> 01:38:40.381
A I SYSTEMS NEED NOT BE FAULTY

01:38:40.447 --> 01:38:42.249
UNRELIABLE BLACK BOXES WHICH LIE

01:38:42.316 --> 01:38:43.951
BEYOND HUMAN UNDERSTANDING AS

01:38:44.018 --> 01:38:45.886
THEY ARE OFTEN PORTRAYED.

01:38:45.953 --> 01:38:47.521
THIS IS A POLITICAL CHOICE.

01:38:47.588 --> 01:38:49.056
SOFTWARE SYSTEMS CAN INSTEAD BE

01:38:49.123 --> 01:38:50.791
DESIGNED TO FUNCTION CORRECTLY

01:38:50.858 --> 01:38:52.559
IN ALL SITUATIONS I OR AT LEAST

01:38:52.626 --> 01:38:53.727
TO CONTAIN FAILURES TO

01:38:53.794 --> 01:38:55.095
PARTICULAR SUB SYSTEM SO THAT

01:38:55.162 --> 01:38:56.530
THEY DO NOT IMPAIR THE OVERALL

01:38:56.597 --> 01:38:59.033
RELIABILITY OR FITNESS FOR USE.

01:38:59.099 --> 01:39:00.701
THE IMAGINED INSPIRED ABILITY OF

01:39:00.768 --> 01:39:02.202
COMPUTER SYSTEMS STEMS FROM

01:39:02.269 --> 01:39:03.337
DIFFERENCES IN KNOWLEDGE AND

01:39:03.404 --> 01:39:04.638
POWER DYNAMICS BETWEEN SYSTEM

01:39:04.705 --> 01:39:06.307
CONTROLLERS.

01:39:06.373 --> 01:39:07.908
SYSTEM CONSUMERS AND SYSTEM

01:39:07.975 --> 01:39:09.677
OVERSEERS.

01:39:09.743 --> 01:39:10.544
ALTHOUGH LARGE OFFER PLATFORMS

01:39:10.611 --> 01:39:11.679
OFTEN CLAIM THAT THEY CANNOT

01:39:11.745 --> 01:39:13.147
EXPLAIN WHY A PARTICULAR

01:39:13.213 --> 01:39:14.415
ADVERTISEMENT WAS SHOWN.

01:39:14.481 --> 01:39:15.849
WHY A PARTICULAR SEARCH RESULT

01:39:15.916 --> 01:39:18.085
WAS RANKED AS IT WAS OR WHEN AND

01:39:18.152 --> 01:39:19.853
HOW OFTEN A PARTICULAR SOCIAL

01:39:19.920 --> 01:39:21.422
NETWORK POST WILL BE VIEWED?

01:39:21.488 --> 01:39:22.756
THE SAME COMPANIES ARE OFTEN

01:39:22.823 --> 01:39:24.325
HIGHLY CERTAIN OF WEATHER

01:39:24.391 --> 01:39:26.060
CHANGES TO THEIR ALGORITHMS WILL

01:39:26.126 --> 01:39:27.428
INCREASE OR DECREASE REVENUES.

01:39:27.494 --> 01:39:29.930
OR CHANGE THE BEHAVIORS OF THEIR

01:39:29.997 --> 01:39:31.165
USERS IN PARTICULAR WAYS.

01:39:31.231 --> 01:39:32.499
CERTAIN ASPECTS OF THE COMPUTING

01:39:32.566 --> 01:39:34.134
ECOSYSTEM FOR EXAMPLE THE GOOGLE

01:39:34.201 --> 01:39:35.636
HOMEPAGE HAVE BECOME SO

01:39:35.703 --> 01:39:37.104
CONSISTENTLY AVAILABLE THAT

01:39:37.171 --> 01:39:38.472
OUTAGES ARE NOW BECAUSE FOR NEWS

01:39:38.539 --> 01:39:40.107
STORIES.

01:39:40.174 --> 01:39:42.209
AND JUSTICE AIRPLANES ELEVATORS

01:39:42.276 --> 01:39:43.644
AND BRIDGES HAVE BEEN IMPROVED

01:39:43.711 --> 01:39:45.145
SO THAT YOU AND I CAN RELY ON

01:39:45.212 --> 01:39:46.947
THEM WITHOUT A NEED FOR A DEEPER

01:39:47.014 --> 01:39:48.949
DETAILED UNDERSTANDING OF HOW OR

01:39:49.016 --> 01:39:50.217
WHY THEY WORK.

01:39:50.284 --> 01:39:52.319
SO TO CAN SOFTWARE BE DESIGNED

01:39:52.386 --> 01:39:54.221
AND BUILT TO MEET STANDARDS OF

01:39:54.288 --> 01:39:54.855
PROPER FUNCTION IN A CONVINCING

01:39:54.922 --> 01:39:55.989
WAY.

01:39:56.056 --> 01:39:57.458
AND JUST AS THE FEDERAL AVIATION

01:39:57.524 --> 01:39:59.460
ADMINISTRATION THE ELEVATOR UNIT

01:39:59.526 --> 01:40:00.828
OF THE OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND

01:40:00.894 --> 01:40:01.628
HEALTH DIVISION OR THE

01:40:01.695 --> 01:40:03.063
DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION.

01:40:03.130 --> 01:40:03.897
PARLAY THOSE TECHNICAL

01:40:03.964 --> 01:40:05.733
ASSURANCES INTO THE TRUST OF

01:40:05.799 --> 01:40:07.000
AVERAGE CITIZENS.

01:40:07.067 --> 01:40:08.669
SO COULD AN APPROPRIATE

01:40:08.736 --> 01:40:09.803
REGULATORY REGIME FOR SOFTWARE

01:40:09.870 --> 01:40:11.138
PARLAY THE CERTAINTIES OF

01:40:11.205 --> 01:40:13.841
SOFTWARE BASED SYSTEMS INTO

01:40:13.907 --> 01:40:16.076
BROAD SOCIAL TRUST.

01:40:16.143 --> 01:40:17.611
THIS BRINGS ME TO MY THIRD POINT

01:40:17.678 --> 01:40:18.645
WHICH IS THAT HUMANS AND

01:40:18.712 --> 01:40:19.913
ORGANIZATIONS MUST BE HELD

01:40:19.980 --> 01:40:21.415
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE BEHAVIOR OF

01:40:21.482 --> 01:40:22.850
COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND ESPECIALLY

01:40:22.916 --> 01:40:24.351
A AYE SYSTEMS.

01:40:24.418 --> 01:40:25.919
UNFORTUNATELY COMPUTER SYSTEMS

01:40:25.986 --> 01:40:27.187
TEND TO UNDERMINE EXISTING

01:40:27.254 --> 01:40:28.055
GOVERNMENT STRUCTURES

01:40:28.122 --> 01:40:29.390
CHALLENGING ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT

01:40:29.456 --> 01:40:30.657
THE NATURE OF FAILURES THE

01:40:30.724 --> 01:40:32.059
ABILITY TO EXAMINE AND ANALYZE

01:40:32.126 --> 01:40:34.161
DECISION MECHANISMS AND THE

01:40:34.228 --> 01:40:34.728
SPEED AND SCALE OF DECISION

01:40:34.795 --> 01:40:36.363
MAKING.

01:40:36.430 --> 01:40:37.598
MERELY EXPLAINING SOFTWARE I

01:40:37.664 --> 01:40:39.233
PUTS TO HUMANS IS UNLIKELY TO

01:40:39.299 --> 01:40:40.434
HELP ON ITS OWN.

01:40:40.501 --> 01:40:41.902
AND PLACING A HUMAN INTO THE

01:40:41.969 --> 01:40:43.270
WORK FLOW ARTIFICIALLY LIMITS

01:40:43.337 --> 01:40:44.571
THE PROMISE OF ECONOMY THESE

01:40:44.638 --> 01:40:45.506
SYSTEMS OFFER WILL

01:40:45.572 --> 01:40:46.840
SIMULTANEOUSLY PREVENTING THEIR

01:40:46.907 --> 01:40:49.076
APPLICATION IN CERTAIN DOMAINS

01:40:49.143 --> 01:40:49.476
WHERE THEY CAN BE

01:40:49.543 --> 01:40:50.544
EXTRAORDINARILY VALUABLE.

01:40:50.611 --> 01:40:53.113
FURTHER STILL WE KNOW THAT HUMAN

01:40:53.180 --> 01:40:54.515
DECISION MAKING CAN BE FLAWED.

01:40:54.581 --> 01:40:55.816
I AND YET WE TREATED AS A GOLD

01:40:55.883 --> 01:40:57.384
STANDARD BUT COMPUTERS ARE

01:40:57.451 --> 01:40:59.253
MACHINES WE CAN DESIGN THEM SO

01:40:59.319 --> 01:41:00.554
THAT WE KNOW HOW THEY WILL

01:41:00.621 --> 01:41:01.522
BEHAVE IN ALL CASES.

01:41:01.588 --> 01:41:02.523
THAT'S WE CAN HOLD THEM TO

01:41:02.589 --> 01:41:04.024
HIGHER STANDARDS OF PERFORMANCE

01:41:04.091 --> 01:41:05.626
AND TRANSPARENCY THAN EVEN HUMAN

01:41:05.692 --> 01:41:07.327
BUREAUCRACIES.

01:41:07.394 --> 01:41:08.729
ALL TOO OFTEN COMPUTER SYSTEMS

01:41:08.796 --> 01:41:11.165
FAILED TO REFLECT THE VALUES WE

01:41:11.231 --> 01:41:12.299
DESIRE THEM TOPPLED.

01:41:12.366 --> 01:41:13.634
SOFTWARE IS EXCELLENT AT

01:41:13.700 --> 01:41:15.369
IMPLEMENTING CLEAR CUT RULES AT

01:41:15.436 --> 01:41:16.937
HIGH SPEED ACROSS LARGE

01:41:17.004 --> 01:41:19.072
POPULATIONS HOWEVER COMPUTERS

01:41:19.139 --> 01:41:21.341
EVEN WITH THE ADVENT OF ADVANCED

01:41:21.408 --> 01:41:22.042
AI.

01:41:22.109 --> 01:41:23.610
ARE LESS APT TO DEALING WITH

01:41:23.677 --> 01:41:24.912
SITUATIONS THAT REQUIRE

01:41:24.978 --> 01:41:26.647
REASONING BEYOND STATED RULES --

01:41:26.713 --> 01:41:28.615
OR THAT REQUIRE INTERPRETATION

01:41:28.682 --> 01:41:30.150
THE APPLICATION OF THOSE RULES

01:41:30.217 --> 01:41:31.919
FLEXIBLE STANDARDS ABSTRACT

01:41:31.985 --> 01:41:33.387
PRINCIPLES AND THE NORMAL

01:41:33.454 --> 01:41:34.855
INTENTIONAL AMBIGUITY IN

01:41:34.922 --> 01:41:36.523
CONTRACTS AND LEGISLATION ALL

01:41:36.590 --> 01:41:39.326
LIE BEYOND THE MECHANISTIC

01:41:39.393 --> 01:41:40.227
OPERATION OF SOFTWARE.

01:41:40.294 --> 01:41:41.528
WELL COMPUTER SCIENTISTS CAN CAN

01:41:41.595 --> 01:41:43.063
CAN GUARANTEE THE FIDELITY OF

01:41:43.130 --> 01:41:44.832
SOFTWARE -- TO ARTICULATED

01:41:44.898 --> 01:41:46.467
REQUIREMENTS THE REAL WORLD

01:41:46.533 --> 01:41:48.135
REQUIRESMORE FLEXIBILITY.

01:41:48.202 --> 01:41:49.670
INSTEAD TO SUPPORT THESE HIGH

01:41:49.736 --> 01:41:51.505
MINDED GOALS WE MUST HIGH HUMAN

01:41:51.572 --> 01:41:53.474
INSTITUTIONS SUCH AS COURTS

01:41:53.540 --> 01:41:55.542

LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEES -- INTO

01:41:57.344 --> 01:41:58.679
COMPUTER SYSTEMS DESIGNING SO

01:41:58.745 --> 01:41:59.713
SHE TECHNICAL SYSTEMS WHICH

01:41:59.780 --> 01:42:01.915
IMPROVE UPON THE GOVERNMENT

01:42:01.982 --> 01:42:04.451
STRUCTURES WE HAVE TODAY.

01:42:04.518 --> 01:42:05.986
YET WITH THAT IN MIND POLICY

01:42:06.053 --> 01:42:07.855
MUST NOT MANDATE THE DESIGN OF

01:42:07.921 --> 01:42:09.923
TECHNOLOGY INSTEAD THE HUMANS

01:42:09.990 --> 01:42:11.291
AND HUMAN ORGANIZATIONS TO

01:42:11.358 --> 01:42:12.860
CREATE A ÁI SYSTEMS MUST BE

01:42:12.926 --> 01:42:14.828
MADE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SAFE

01:42:14.895 --> 01:42:15.829
INAPPROPRIATE OPERATION OF THE

01:42:15.896 --> 01:42:17.197
SYSTEMS.

01:42:17.264 --> 01:42:18.499
THAT IS POLICY INTERVENTION

01:42:18.565 --> 01:42:19.333
SHOULD SPECIFY WHAT THE

01:42:19.399 --> 01:42:20.834
CONTROLLERS OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS

01:42:20.901 --> 01:42:22.903
ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR RATHER THAN

01:42:22.970 --> 01:42:24.705

MORE ROBUST PUBLIC SPHERE AROUND

ALTHOUGH IT IS OFTEN SUGGESTED

01:43:41.281 --> 01:43:42.549
AS A SOLUTION HOWEVER FULL

01:43:42.616 --> 01:43:44.384
TRANSPARENCY OF SOFTWARE SYSTEMS

01:43:44.451 --> 01:43:46.219
IS GENERALLY NEITHER NECESSARY

01:43:47.754 --> 01:43:49.489
A MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY AND THE

THINGS THAT PEOPLE NEED TO KNOW.

01:43:58.231 --> 01:43:59.399
OUR NORRIS TRANSPARENCY

01:43:59.466 --> 01:44:01.969
SUFFICIENT BECAUSE SOFTWARE --

01:44:02.035 --> 01:44:03.236
THAT IS NOT DESIGNED TO

FACILITATE ASSURANCE MAY IN FACT

01:44:05.205 --> 01:44:06.807
BE IMPOSSIBLE TO ANALYZE FOR

01:44:06.873 --> 01:44:09.443
TECHNICAL PERSPECTIVE.

01:44:09.509 --> 01:44:09.977
THE TRANSPARENCY IS OFTEN

01:44:10.043 --> 01:44:11.912
UNDESIRABLE IT PRESENTS RISKS TO

01:44:11.979 --> 01:44:13.180
INDIVIDUAL PRIVACY IN TRADE

01:44:13.246 --> 01:44:15.115

OPPORTUNITIES FOR GOVERNMENTS

01:44:20.253 --> 01:44:21.388
THAT ARE STRUCK THAT ARE SUBTLER

01:44:21.455 --> 01:44:23.223
AND MORE FLEXIBLE THAN TOTAL

01:44:23.290 --> 01:44:28.662
TRANSPARENCY -- AND AND WE

01:44:28.729 --> 01:44:30.364
SHOULD PURSUE THAT THAT ROUTE OF

01:44:30.430 --> 01:44:32.099
COURSE THIS DISCUSSION ALLIED'S

01:44:32.165 --> 01:44:33.834
A NUMBER OF IMPORTANT QUESTIONS

01:44:33.900 --> 01:44:35.102
IN THE POLICY OF ARTIFICIAL

01:44:35.168 --> 01:44:35.869

01:44:38.839 --> 01:44:40.374
AND CITIZENS LEADS TO NEW

01:44:40.440 --> 01:44:41.575
THREATS TO PRIVACY.

01:44:41.642 --> 01:44:42.509
THE USE OF STATISTICAL

THE ASSUMPTIONS OF EXISTING DATA

01:44:49.616 --> 01:44:50.584
PROTECTION LAWS.

01:44:50.651 --> 01:44:52.919
INCLUDING THE NEWLY ENACTED

01:44:52.986 --> 01:44:55.055
CALIFORNIA CONSUMER PRIVACY. FOR

01:44:55.122 --> 01:44:56.256
EXAMPLE ONE MAJOR RETAILER

01:44:56.323 --> 01:44:57.791
REPORTEDLY DEVELOPED A SYSTEM

01:44:57.858 --> 01:44:59.192
FOR PREDICTING WHICH OF ITS

01:44:59.259 --> 01:45:01.028
CUSTOMERS WERE PREGNANT BASED ON

01:45:01.094 --> 01:45:02.663
THEIR PURCHASE HISTORIES RAISING

01:45:02.729 --> 01:45:04.798
THE SPECTER OF NEW FORMS OF

01:45:04.865 --> 01:45:05.966
HEALTH BASED DISCRIMINATION.

01:45:06.033 --> 01:45:08.135
FROM ACTORS WITH NO OVER ACCESS

01:45:08.201 --> 01:45:10.270
TO HEALTH CARE INFORMATION.

01:45:10.337 --> 01:45:11.638
THERE'S ALSO WIDE AGREEMENT THAT

01:45:11.705 --> 01:45:13.306
IS A AYE AUTOMATES AN INCREASING

01:45:13.373 --> 01:45:14.941
NUMBER OF TASKS THE NUMBER AND

01:45:15.008 --> 01:45:17.244
NATURE OF JOBS REMAINING FOR

01:45:17.310 --> 01:45:18.578
HUMANS WILL CHANGE DAMASCUS.

01:45:18.645 --> 01:45:20.013
THIRD WILL CHANGE DRAMATICALLY.

01:45:20.080 --> 01:45:21.782
AS NEW AND MORE AUTOMATED

01:45:21.848 --> 01:45:24.051
SYSTEMS WORK DISPLACE EXISTING

01:45:24.117 --> 01:45:25.819
HUMAN MEDIATED SYSTEMS OF WORK.

01:45:25.886 --> 01:45:27.087
THE EFFECTS ON WORKERS AND THE

01:45:27.154 --> 01:45:28.789
POLICY RESPONSES NECESSARY TO

01:45:28.855 --> 01:45:30.323
MITIGATE THEM REMAIN IMPORTANT

01:45:30.390 --> 01:45:31.958
OPEN QUESTIONS.

01:45:32.025 --> 01:45:33.160
IN CONCLUSION AS POLICY IN

01:45:33.226 --> 01:45:34.895
ENGINEERING PRACTICE INVOLVED TO

01:45:34.961 --> 01:45:35.829
DEAL WITH THE NEW FOUND

01:45:35.896 --> 01:45:36.963
IMPORTANCE OF SOFTWARE SYSTEMS

01:45:37.030 --> 01:45:38.732
IT IS CRITICAL THAT WE DO NOT

01:45:38.799 --> 01:45:39.866
ALLOW SOFTWARE SYSTEMS TO

01:45:39.933 --> 01:45:40.534
OPERATE.

01:45:40.600 --> 01:45:42.135
CHECKED BY DESIGNING A AYE

01:45:42.202 --> 01:45:43.336
SYSTEMS SO THAT THEY BETTER LINE

01:45:43.403 --> 01:45:44.871
WITH LEGAL AND POLICY OBJECTIVES

01:45:44.938 --> 01:45:46.039
WE CAN IMPROVE THE GOVERNANCE OF

01:45:46.106 --> 01:45:47.474
SOFTWARE SYSTEMS.

01:45:47.541 --> 01:45:49.142
AND SOMETIMES OF EXISTING HUMAN

01:45:49.209 --> 01:45:52.279
MEDIATED SYSTEMS BY EXTENSION.

01:45:52.345 --> 01:45:54.281
THANK YOU AND I LOOK FORWARD TO

01:45:54.347 --> 01:45:54.648

01:45:54.715 --> 01:45:56.483
THANK YOU [inaudible]

01:45:56.550 --> 01:45:58.218
QUESTIONS [inaudible]

01:45:58.285 --> 01:46:00.387
NO.

01:46:00.454 --> 01:46:03.390
QUESTION BUT I TRY TO UNDERSTAND.

01:46:03.457 --> 01:46:05.625
UP A LOT OF WHAT YOU WERE SAYING

01:46:05.692 --> 01:46:09.896
BUT I THINK I GOT THE GIST OF

01:46:09.963 --> 01:46:11.331
SEVERAL OF OF THE ISSUES.

01:46:11.398 --> 01:46:14.000
WHICH KIND OF POINT.

01:46:14.067 --> 01:46:16.369
TO HAVING.

01:46:16.436 --> 01:46:20.307
KIND OF A OF SOMEONE WITH YOUR

01:46:20.373 --> 01:46:21.875
EXPERTISE.

01:46:21.942 --> 01:46:23.810
IN THE FRONT END [inaudible]

01:46:23.877 --> 01:46:25.879
IN GOVERNMENT.

01:46:25.946 --> 01:46:28.048
SO THAT AS WE DEVELOP POLICIES

01:46:28.115 --> 01:46:29.716
THAT WE COULD NEVER IMAGINE

01:46:29.783 --> 01:46:30.450
WOULD.

01:46:30.517 --> 01:46:34.087
HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT OR WOULD

01:46:34.154 --> 01:46:36.423
HELP TO CREATE BIASES -- OR

01:46:36.490 --> 01:46:40.093
INEQUITIES THAT WE DON'T DO IT.

01:46:40.160 --> 01:46:42.796
JUST ACCIDENTALLY WE WE SHOULD.

01:46:42.863 --> 01:46:46.700
BE VERY CONSCIOUS OF THAT SO --

01:46:46.767 --> 01:46:48.802
SHAPE.

01:46:48.869 --> 01:46:52.939
I THINK I THE A LOT OF THAT.

01:46:53.006 --> 01:46:55.041
THANK YOU -- THANK YOU SENATOR

01:47:06.319 --> 01:47:09.122
MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WISH TO

01:47:09.189 --> 01:47:12.092
EXPRESS POINTS OF VIEW.

THE S. -- SENATOR RUSSELL.

01:47:15.462 --> 01:47:16.830
I ASK YOU TO CHAIR THE COMMITTEE

01:47:16.897 --> 01:47:27.407
FOR JUST A FEW MOMENTS.

01:47:27.474 --> 01:47:31.378
YOU CAN PASS AROUND US.

01:47:31.444 --> 01:47:34.281
MADAM CHAIR SENATOR THANK YOU

01:47:34.347 --> 01:47:35.182
VERY MUCH FOR HAVING THIS

01:47:35.248 --> 01:47:36.349
HEARING SERRA FLOCKS IN THE

01:47:36.416 --> 01:47:37.951
CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION

01:47:38.018 --> 01:47:40.053
THERE'S SO MUCH TO COMMENT ON

01:47:40.120 --> 01:47:41.488
HERE BUT I WANTED TO FOCUS.

01:47:41.555 --> 01:47:43.690
NARROWLY ON THE IMPACT OF WORK

01:47:43.757 --> 01:47:47.027
CURSE -- THIS CAME UP SEVERAL

01:47:47.093 --> 01:47:49.830
TIMES AND AND THERE WAS AN

01:47:49.896 --> 01:47:51.431
ARTICLE RECENTLY THE NEW YORK

01:47:51.498 --> 01:47:53.133
TIMES ABOUT.

01:47:53.200 --> 01:47:55.202
HOW A ROBOT WON'T NECESSARILY

01:47:55.268 --> 01:47:57.137
REPLACE YOUR JOB BUT THEY MAY BE

01:47:57.204 --> 01:47:58.438
YOUR BOSS?

01:47:58.505 --> 01:47:59.973
AND THERE'S A LOT OF

01:48:00.040 --> 01:48:01.041
IMPLICATIONS AND POLICY

01:48:01.107 --> 01:48:03.076
IMPLICATIONS WHEN ARTIFICIAL

01:48:03.143 --> 01:48:05.645
INTELLIGENCE STARTS TO PERMEATE

01:48:05.712 --> 01:48:06.580
THE WORK FORCE.

01:48:06.646 --> 01:48:09.182
I'M ISSUES OF SURVEILLANCE AND

01:48:09.249 --> 01:48:11.117
ISSUES OF DISCRIMINATION RIGHT

01:48:11.184 --> 01:48:12.519
NOW A LOT OF WORKERS ARE

01:48:12.586 --> 01:48:13.820
MONITORED BY ARTIFICIAL

01:48:13.887 --> 01:48:14.921
INTELLIGENCE THERE SOME

01:48:14.988 --> 01:48:16.022
COMPANIES.

01:48:16.089 --> 01:48:19.059
REPORTEDLY LIKE AMAZON -- THAT

01:48:19.125 --> 01:48:22.429
HAS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE THAT.

01:48:22.495 --> 01:48:25.298
EVALUATES AND FIRES WORKERS THIS

01:48:25.365 --> 01:48:27.534
RAISES ISSUES OF WEIRD YOU GO IF

01:48:27.601 --> 01:48:28.835
YOU ARE RETALIATED AGAINST HER

01:48:28.902 --> 01:48:29.870
FIRED AND THINK IT'S

01:48:29.936 --> 01:48:31.805
DISCRIMINATORY.

01:48:31.872 --> 01:48:33.206
DO YOU GO TO D. FBIH.

01:48:33.273 --> 01:48:34.741
IS THERE A CLAIM OF A MACHINE

01:48:34.808 --> 01:48:36.776
FIRES YOU FOR DISCRIMINATION ON

01:48:36.843 --> 01:48:39.346
ANY BASIS -- SO I JUST A HOST OF

01:48:39.412 --> 01:48:40.947
ISSUES DEALING WITH THE

01:48:41.014 --> 01:48:44.451
WORKPLACE EVEN BEYOND HOW DO WE

01:48:44.517 --> 01:48:46.653
DEAL WITH THE DISPLACEMENT OF

01:48:46.720 --> 01:48:47.287
WORKERS.

01:48:47.354 --> 01:48:50.090
I'M WE THINK THAT MOST LIKELY

01:48:50.156 --> 01:48:50.757
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE

01:48:50.824 --> 01:48:52.158
TECHNOLOGY WILL CHANGE THE

01:48:52.225 --> 01:48:54.394
NATURE OF WORK IN WAYS THAT WE

01:48:54.461 --> 01:48:55.896
NEED TO BE AWARE OF I'M

01:48:55.962 --> 01:48:57.664
DISCRIMINATION ON THE BASIS OF

01:48:57.731 --> 01:48:59.566
OF HEALTH STATUS THINGS LIKE

THAT THE GOVERNOR HAS REALLY

01:51:30.250 --> 01:51:31.951
TAKEN THE LEAD ON THIS I THINK

01:51:32.018 --> 01:51:38.358

REAL QUICKLY I THINK WILL ECHO

01:51:53.740 --> 01:51:55.508
SOME OF THE THE COMMON THIRTY

01:51:55.575 --> 01:51:57.177
MADE I THINK THE ISSUE OF

01:51:57.243 --> 01:51:59.012
PRIVACY -- IS SOMETHING THAT

01:51:59.079 --> 01:52:00.814
WILL WORK ON SEPARATELY -- BUT I

01:52:00.880 --> 01:52:03.583
THINK THAT A CORE ISSUE FOR SK

ALREADY EXIST IN OUR SOCIETY SO

01:52:17.063 --> 01:52:18.098
I THINK THAT THAT HAS TO BE ONE

01:52:18.164 --> 01:52:19.999
OF THE CORE.

01:52:20.066 --> 01:52:22.469
