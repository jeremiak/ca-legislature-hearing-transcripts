A NONPROFIT LET ALONE OPERATING

00:35:53.217 --> 00:35:55.253
ONE DURING A GLOBAL PANDEMIC.

THE COVERT NINETEEN PANDEMIC HAS

00:35:58.155 --> 00:35:59.857

01:14:56.158 --> 01:14:58.060
OF THE SOLUTIONS GOING FORWARD.

K. CENTER LAMONT. THANK YOU AND-

01:15:01.263 --> 01:15:02.598
YOU KNOW I THINK THAT THAT WAS

01:15:02.664 --> 01:15:04.166
REALLY IMPORTANT I HEARD A FEW

01:15:04.233 --> 01:15:06.368
THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN TEAMS IN

01:15:06.435 --> 01:15:08.403
THE LAST TWO YEARS. THE A DO

01:15:08.470 --> 01:15:10.772
THINK NEED ADDRESSING- AND I

01:15:10.839 --> 01:15:12.708
WANT TO POINT THOSE THINGS OUT-

01:15:12.774 --> 01:15:15.277
WEEK WE HEARD ISSUES. RELATED TO

01:15:15.344 --> 01:15:17.613
THE ZERO FIVE H. PRESCHOOLS

01:15:17.679 --> 01:15:20.916
CHILD CARE WHICH CONTINUE TO BE-

01:15:20.983 --> 01:15:23.585
AN ISSUE I KNOW THAT. WHEN YOU

01:15:23.652 --> 01:15:24.920
SPEAK TO THEM THEY FEEL LIKE

01:15:24.987 --> 01:15:26.388
THEY'RE THE LAST IN LINE TO HEAR

01:15:26.455 --> 01:15:28.123
WHAT THE GUIDELINES ARE HAD TO

01:15:28.190 --> 01:15:30.058
GO THROUGH THE PROCESS AND SO-

01:15:30.125 --> 01:15:31.593
THAT THAT FEELS LIKE SOMETHING

01:15:31.660 --> 01:15:33.262
THAT'S BEEN ECHOED REALLY ACROSS

01:15:33.328 --> 01:15:35.097
THE STATE. THAT WE HEARD ABOUT

01:15:35.163 --> 01:15:36.999
THE IMPORTANCE AND FLEXIBILITY

01:15:37.065 --> 01:15:39.234
IN CONTRACTING OVER AND OVER AND

01:15:39.301 --> 01:15:41.536
OVER DURING AN EMERGENCY- WE

01:15:41.603 --> 01:15:43.538
HAVE UNDERSTOOD THAT IN ORDER

01:15:43.605 --> 01:15:46.174
FOR. OUR NON PROFITS TO ADAPT BE

01:15:46.241 --> 01:15:47.743
NEED SOME FLEXIBILITY IN

01:15:47.809 --> 01:15:50.646
CONTRACTING WE HAVE HAD TO ADAPT

01:15:50.712 --> 01:15:53.048
OUR OWN JOBS SO I THINK IT'S THE

01:15:53.115 --> 01:15:55.484
SHOULD EXPECT THAT THERE'S- A

01:15:55.550 --> 01:15:57.619
MORE WILL HELP. THE SAME THING

01:15:57.686 --> 01:15:58.921
IN OUR A STEEP ESPECIALLY IF

01:15:58.987 --> 01:16:00.555
THEIR CONTRACT WITH THE STATE.

01:16:00.622 --> 01:16:01.623
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE MUST

01:16:01.690 --> 01:16:03.325
RECOGNIZE I KNOW THAT AND A

01:16:03.392 --> 01:16:05.694
MEMBER U. S. X. REF A LETTER-

01:16:05.761 --> 01:16:06.628
THAT WENT OUT EARLY IN THE

01:16:06.695 --> 01:16:08.497
PANDEMIC THAT SEVERAL OF US YOU

01:16:08.563 --> 01:16:09.965
KNOW SIGNED ON TO- AND WE'RE

01:16:10.032 --> 01:16:11.700
PART OF THAT. THAT ASKED THE

01:16:11.767 --> 01:16:12.734
STATE TO DO THAT AND THE STATE

01:16:12.801 --> 01:16:15.404
DID- BUT CERTAINLY IF THERE ARE

01:16:15.470 --> 01:16:16.538
ELEMENTS WHERE WE COULD DO A

01:16:16.605 --> 01:16:18.907
BETTER JOB OF CONTRACT OF THE OF

01:16:18.974 --> 01:16:20.142
PROVIDING THAT FLEXIBILITY IN

01:16:20.208 --> 01:16:22.711
CONTRACTING. I WOULD BE VERY

01:16:22.778 --> 01:16:27.749
OPEN TO HEARING ABOUT. THAT- YOU

01:16:27.816 --> 01:16:29.685
KNOW. IF WE THE WAITING FOR-

01:16:29.751 --> 01:16:31.553
ANGLE INTO. IS IT IS IT EVEN TO

01:16:31.620 --> 01:16:34.222
REALLY HEARTBREAKING AND- YOU

01:16:34.289 --> 01:16:35.290
KNOW I THINK ASSEMBLY MEMBER

01:16:35.357 --> 01:16:37.426
GIPSON. REFER TO THAT BUT THAT

01:16:37.492 --> 01:16:39.695
IS A HUGE PROBLEM ASKING OUR

01:16:39.761 --> 01:16:41.730
NONPROFITS TO GO INTO DEBT

01:16:41.797 --> 01:16:44.199
BECAUSE THE STATE- IS LAGGING ON

01:16:44.266 --> 01:16:45.934
A REIMBURSEMENT I HOPE IS

01:16:46.001 --> 01:16:48.003
SOMETHING THAT WE CAN LOOK INTO

01:16:48.070 --> 01:16:51.006
AS THE LEGISLATURE- WE HAVE TO

01:16:51.073 --> 01:16:52.741
BE ABLE TO HELP OUR- NONPROFIT

01:16:52.808 --> 01:16:55.444
SURVIVE. AND YOU KNOW WHAT THE

01:16:55.510 --> 01:16:57.379
WAIT PERIODS ARE WHY THERE ARE

01:16:57.446 --> 01:16:59.581
SUCH LONG WAIT PERIODS- TO GET

01:16:59.648 --> 01:17:01.249
THOSE REIMBURSEMENT- FROM THE

01:17:01.316 --> 01:17:04.119
CONTRACTS I THINK WOULD BE

01:17:04.186 --> 01:17:05.187
IMPORTANT FOR US TO UNDERSTAND.

01:17:05.253 --> 01:17:07.222
I BOTH WAS WORRIED BUT ALSO

01:17:07.289 --> 01:17:09.224
OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THE COMMENTS

01:17:09.291 --> 01:17:10.959
RELATED TO THE VOLUNTEER LABOR

01:17:11.026 --> 01:17:12.861
CHALLENGES- THE FACT THAT WE'RE

01:17:12.928 --> 01:17:14.997
LOSING TWENTY FIVE TO PART 40%

01:17:15.063 --> 01:17:17.966
OF OUR VOLUNTEERS- WHO TEND TO

01:17:18.033 --> 01:17:20.302
BE MOSTLY ELDERS- WHEN WE KNOW

01:17:20.369 --> 01:17:21.937
THAT ALSO THE PANDEMIC HAS

01:17:22.004 --> 01:17:23.372
FORCED TO YOU KNOW FOR HEALTH

01:17:23.438 --> 01:17:27.142
REASONS AND SAFETY REASONS- FOR

01:17:27.209 --> 01:17:28.777
US UP YOU KNOW FOR ALL OF US TO

01:17:28.844 --> 01:17:30.545
BE MORE CAREFUL. BUT CERTAINLY

01:17:30.612 --> 01:17:33.648
THAT IS SOMETHING THAT IS- THAT

01:17:33.715 --> 01:17:34.783
WE NEED TO BE AWARE OF THAT WERE

01:17:34.850 --> 01:17:36.952
LOSING VOLUNTEERS BUT I WAS

01:17:37.019 --> 01:17:38.353
OPTIMISTIC WHEN I HEARD THAT MY

01:17:38.420 --> 01:17:40.522
LABIALS. ARE THE ONES THAT ARE

01:17:40.589 --> 01:17:42.524
LIKE SIGN ME UP I WANT TO

01:17:42.591 --> 01:17:44.793
VOLUNTEER AND SO I HOPE AND THAT

01:17:44.860 --> 01:17:46.228
WE COULD ALSO LEARN MORE ABOUT

01:17:46.294 --> 01:17:47.696
THAT ABOUT WHAT ARE THE WAYS

01:17:47.763 --> 01:17:50.198
THAT WE- COULD SUPPORT THAT WE

01:17:50.265 --> 01:17:51.600
COULD. YOU KNOW SIT WHETHER IT'S

01:17:51.666 --> 01:17:53.535
SUPPORTING INDIVIDUALLY OR IF

01:17:53.602 --> 01:17:55.103
THERE ARE LEGISLATIVE TOOLS THAT

01:17:55.170 --> 01:17:57.472
MAKE IT EASIER FOR MILLENNIALS

01:17:57.539 --> 01:17:58.807
TO VOLUNTEER THAT SOMETHING

01:17:58.874 --> 01:18:00.642
THAT. I WOULD ALSO LOVE TO LEARN

01:18:00.709 --> 01:18:02.711
MORE ABOUT SO THOSE ARE SOME OF

01:18:02.778 --> 01:18:05.013
THE THEMES- WHAT WAS MENTIONED

01:18:05.080 --> 01:18:07.549
TO DATE IS NOT- THEY'RE NOT

01:18:07.616 --> 01:18:09.551
ISOLATED THINGS LIKE WE AYE I

01:18:09.618 --> 01:18:11.019
KNOW WE'VE HEARD THIS I'VE I'VE

01:18:11.086 --> 01:18:13.055
HEARD THIS- AND THESE THEMES

01:18:13.121 --> 01:18:15.824
REALLY COME UP AS WELL. AS YOU

01:18:15.891 --> 01:18:17.492
YOU TALK TO NONPROFITS ACROSS

01:18:17.559 --> 01:18:19.661
THE STATE AND SO- I APPRECIATE

01:18:19.728 --> 01:18:21.296
THERE ARE NONPROFITS STILL HANG

01:18:21.363 --> 01:18:22.964
IN THERE KNOWING AND THAT THERE

01:18:23.031 --> 01:18:25.033
ARE SOME CHALLENGES-AND HOPE

01:18:25.100 --> 01:18:26.701
THAT THIS ALLOWS US TO FURTHER

01:18:26.768 --> 01:18:29.071
LOOK INTO SOME OF THESE ISSUES.

01:18:29.137 --> 01:18:32.474
TO SEE HOW THE STATE COULD BE A

01:18:32.541 --> 01:18:33.975
BETTER PARTNER. THANK YOU. THANK

01:18:34.042 --> 01:18:36.711
YOU SENATOR LEE MY- I. WANT TO

01:18:36.778 --> 01:18:38.246
ADD ON TO WHAT MY COLLEAGUES

01:18:38.313 --> 01:18:40.215
HAVE ALREADY. BROUGHT UP AS AS

01:18:40.282 --> 01:18:41.283
ISSUES AND SOME OF THE THINGS

01:18:41.349 --> 01:18:44.219
THAT WE HEARD. OF BUT ONE THING

01:18:44.286 --> 01:18:45.220
I THOUGHT ABOUT WHEN WE'RE

01:18:45.287 --> 01:18:47.022
TALKING ABOUT. THE LACK OF

01:18:47.089 --> 01:18:49.191
FLEXIBILITY ON STATE CONTRACTS

01:18:49.257 --> 01:18:50.792
THAT. WE ALSO HAVE TO

01:18:50.859 --> 01:18:52.527
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT SOMETIMES THESE

01:18:52.594 --> 01:18:55.197
CONTRACTS. DO NOT COVER THE FULL

01:18:55.263 --> 01:18:58.033
COSTS. OF THE- SERVICES THAT ARE

01:18:58.100 --> 01:19:00.435
DELIVERED NONPROFITS HAVE TO

01:19:00.502 --> 01:19:02.104
HAVE FUND RAISERS THEIR-

01:19:02.170 --> 01:19:04.673
FUNDRAISING GALAS IN APPEALS AT

01:19:04.739 --> 01:19:06.341
THE END OF THE YEAR. TO COVER

01:19:06.408 --> 01:19:09.978
THE GAP. I'M IN IT IT FEELS THAT

01:19:10.045 --> 01:19:11.880
WE'RE NOT VALUING. THEIR

01:19:11.947 --> 01:19:13.815
SERVICES THE SERVICES THAT THEY

01:19:13.882 --> 01:19:15.083
ARE PROVIDING TO OUR

01:19:15.150 --> 01:19:18.687
CONSTITUENTS. ACROSS THE STATE

01:19:18.753 --> 01:19:20.155
BECAUSE WE'RE NOT PAYING THEM

01:19:20.222 --> 01:19:21.456
ENOUGH TO DO IT. AND SO I HOPE

01:19:21.523 --> 01:19:23.792
THAT. WE THINK ABOUT THAT TOO IS

01:19:23.859 --> 01:19:26.094
LIKE WHAT IS THE COST TO DELIVER

01:19:26.161 --> 01:19:28.830
THESE CRITICAL SERVICES- IN

01:19:28.897 --> 01:19:33.034
TIMES OF NEED ESPECIALLY. OF A-

01:19:33.101 --> 01:19:34.870
THOUGHT ABOUT WHAT JANET WAS

01:19:34.936 --> 01:19:37.038
SAYING ABOUT THE FUNDING CLIFF

01:19:37.105 --> 01:19:39.541
AFTER FOR COVERT NINETEEN WHAT

01:19:39.608 --> 01:19:42.110
HAPPENS WHEN THE CDC. DECLARES

01:19:42.177 --> 01:19:44.913
THIS PANDEMIC OVER. AND BUT

01:19:44.980 --> 01:19:46.548
THERE'S STILL A HUGE NEED IN OUR

01:19:46.615 --> 01:19:48.049
COMMUNITIES AND HOW DO WE

01:19:48.116 --> 01:19:50.519
CONTINUE. TO PROVIDE THAT

01:19:50.585 --> 01:19:52.487
SUPPORT TO GET PEOPLE BACK ON

01:19:52.554 --> 01:19:54.556
THEIR FEET BACK INTO JOBS.

01:19:54.623 --> 01:19:56.992
CHILDREN INTO PRESCHOOLS- AT

01:19:57.058 --> 01:20:00.228
CETERA AND SO I HOPE THAT WE AS

01:20:00.295 --> 01:20:02.364
A LEGISLATURE CONTINUE TO PRESS.

01:20:02.430 --> 01:20:05.433
FOR THOSE MUCH NEEDED SERVICES.

01:20:05.500 --> 01:20:07.402
AND AS FAR AS VOLUNTEERS WHEN

01:20:07.469 --> 01:20:09.204
KAREN WAS TALKING. ABOUT

01:20:09.271 --> 01:20:12.207
VOLUNTEERS. I THOUGHT OF MY OWN

01:20:12.274 --> 01:20:14.042
EXPERIENCE DURING THE PANDEMIC

01:20:14.109 --> 01:20:16.711

01:20:16.778 --> 01:20:19.281

VOLUNTEER THEY WANTED TO HELP.

01:20:21.183 --> 01:20:23.185
THEY DON'T KNOW HOW TO OR WHERE

01:20:23.251 --> 01:20:26.121

SHOW UP AS OVERHEAD RIGHT WE

01:20:51.379 --> 01:20:53.048
WANT IT DIRECTLY TO PROGRAM

01:20:53.114 --> 01:20:55.016
SERVICES BECAUSE OUR FUNDERS

01:20:55.083 --> 01:20:57.085
DEMAND THAT RATE THEY WANT. I

01:20:57.152 --> 01:20:58.453
HAD THE HIGHEST PERCENTAGE OF

01:20:58.520 --> 01:21:00.655
YOUR BUDGET TO BE ALLOCATED TO

01:22:41.956 --> 01:22:43.825
LEG UP SO ONE OF THE THINGS WE

01:22:43.892 --> 01:22:48.430
CAN DO. IS TO TRY AND PUT SOME

01:22:48.496 --> 01:22:49.764
INFRASTRUCTURE AND I'M USING

AND THIS CAN'T MENTION WE

01:27:30.845 --> 01:27:32.814
LEVERAGE THE ECONOMICAL THE

01:27:32.880 --> 01:27:34.415
EQUIVALENT OF A VOLUNTEER IS IN

01:27:34.482 --> 01:27:36.951
CALIFORNIA THE EQUIVALENT OF

01:27:37.018 --> 01:27:37.452
THREE HUNDRED THIRTY ONE

01:27:37.518 --> 01:27:40.355
THOUSAND. FULL TIME JOBS ARE ARE

01:27:40.421 --> 01:27:42.657
THAT WORK IS DONE BY VOLUNTEERS

01:27:42.724 --> 01:27:44.192
IN CALIFORNIA SO THESE ARE ALL

01:27:44.258 --> 01:27:46.160
IMPORTANT WAYS THAT. SUPPORTING

01:27:46.227 --> 01:27:48.997
NONPROFITS I END UP HAVING A

01:27:49.063 --> 01:27:51.633
VERY HIGH MULTIPLIER EFFECT. SO

01:27:51.699 --> 01:27:52.934
WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THE

01:27:53.001 --> 01:27:54.535
PANDEMIC BUT AS OTHERS SPEAKERS

01:27:54.602 --> 01:27:57.171
AND MENTION WE HAVE A LOT OF

01:27:57.238 --> 01:27:58.272
NORMAL IF YOU WELL I'D MERGING

01:27:58.339 --> 01:27:59.807
SEES ME FALL HAD EARTHQUAKES

01:27:59.874 --> 01:28:02.744
WILDFIRES- MUDSLIDES IN DROUGHT

01:28:02.810 --> 01:28:04.278
THESE ARE KIND OF OUR USUAL

01:28:04.345 --> 01:28:07.281
EMERGENCIES- THAT. ARE ALWAYS

01:28:07.348 --> 01:28:09.217
GOING TO CONTINUE TO COME UP SO

01:28:09.283 --> 01:28:10.752
THESE ARE SOME OF THE HIGHLIGHTS

01:28:10.818 --> 01:28:12.820
FOR WHAT WE REALLY NEED TO BE

01:28:12.887 --> 01:28:14.422
ABLE TO DO THE WORK THAT WE DO.

01:28:14.489 --> 01:28:16.157
FIRST IS JUST RECOGNIZING THE

01:28:16.224 --> 01:28:18.493
POWER OF GOVERNMENT RELIEF. YOU

01:28:18.559 --> 01:28:20.762
KNOW IN JUST THE FIRST PART. OF

01:28:20.828 --> 01:28:22.296
THE CALIFORNIA SMALL BUSINESS

01:28:22.363 --> 01:28:24.098
RELIEF PROGRAM WHICH WE WERE A

01:28:24.165 --> 01:28:25.967
PARTNER MORE THAN EIGHT HUNDRED

01:28:26.034 --> 01:28:27.802
NONPROFITS RECEIVED GRANTS. OF

01:28:27.869 --> 01:28:29.470
MORE THAN NINETY EIGHT MILLION

01:28:29.537 --> 01:28:31.172
DOLLARS. AND WHEN YOU THINK

01:28:31.239 --> 01:28:33.107
ABOUT HOW MANY NOT ALL THE WORK

01:28:33.174 --> 01:28:35.443
THAT CONSIGLIO. AND BECAUSE OF

01:28:35.510 --> 01:28:36.978
THESE OTHER ORGANIZATIONS HAVE

01:28:37.045 --> 01:28:38.746
DONE A LOT OF IT IS AND BECAUSE

01:28:38.813 --> 01:28:40.381
THEY WERE ABLE TO GET THAT KIND

01:28:40.448 --> 01:28:42.016
OF FUNDING. IT JUST WASN'T

01:28:42.083 --> 01:28:43.184
AVAILABLE EVEN THOUGH

01:28:43.251 --> 01:28:48.389
FOUNDATIONS. AND INDIVIDUAL

01:28:48.456 --> 01:28:49.691
DONORS WE'RE MUCH MORE TO. AND

01:28:49.757 --> 01:28:51.025
STEPPING UP THEY CAN MATCH THE

01:28:51.092 --> 01:28:52.694
POWER OF GOD TO DO KIND OF WORK.

01:28:52.760 --> 01:28:53.561
SECONDLY WE NEED REALLY FROM

01:28:53.628 --> 01:28:55.096
THAT ARE UNDERSTANDABLE IN THE

01:28:55.163 --> 01:28:56.564
FIRST SET OF QUESTIONS OF

01:28:56.631 --> 01:28:57.899
APPLICATIONS FOR THE RELIEF

01:28:57.965 --> 01:28:59.434
PROGRAM THE FIRST QUESTION WAS

01:28:59.500 --> 01:29:01.436
WHAT IS THE NAME OF THE OWNER.

01:29:01.502 --> 01:29:02.870
NO THAT'S A PHRASE THAT KIND OF

01:29:02.937 --> 01:29:04.372
MADE NONPROFIT STATE MAYBE I

01:29:04.439 --> 01:29:05.840
DON'T BELONG HERE BECAUSE OF

01:29:05.907 --> 01:29:07.308
COURSE BE NONPROFITS DON'T HAVE

01:29:07.375 --> 01:29:09.777
OWNERS- WE ARE ALREADY IN EFFECT

01:29:09.844 --> 01:29:11.045
BY THE PUBLIC SO WE NEED TO

01:29:11.112 --> 01:29:12.480
LEAVE PROGRAMS THAT SPEAK THE

01:29:12.547 --> 01:29:14.449
LANGUAGE. OF NONPROFITS AND

01:29:14.515 --> 01:29:15.850
MAKES SENSE TO THEM SO THAT THEY

01:29:15.917 --> 01:29:17.418
CAN SUCCESSFULLY FILL OUT THE

01:29:17.485 --> 01:29:19.487
APPLICATIONS. AS SEVERAL PEOPLE

01:29:19.554 --> 01:29:20.922
HAVE MENTIONED WE NEED CONTRACT

01:29:20.988 --> 01:29:22.623
THAT'S ABILITY SOMETIMES FOR

01:29:22.690 --> 01:29:24.425
EXAMPLE WE HAVE TO KEEP OUR

01:29:24.492 --> 01:29:26.694
CHILDCARE SO. CHILDCARE CENTERS

01:29:26.761 --> 01:29:28.096
OPEN FOR THE CHILDREN OF

01:29:28.162 --> 01:29:30.364
EMERGENCY WORKERS BUT WE ARE NOT

01:29:30.431 --> 01:29:31.666
ABLE TO MEET FOR EXAMPLE THE

01:29:31.733 --> 01:29:33.801
DELIVERABLES OF THE NORMAL MARC

01:29:33.868 --> 01:29:35.670
NORMAL ATTENDANCE RATES. UPON

01:29:35.737 --> 01:29:36.671
WHICH OUR CONTRACTS WAS

01:29:36.738 --> 01:29:38.940
DELIVERED AND OTHER TIMES WE

01:29:39.006 --> 01:29:40.708
HAVE TO QUICKLY BE ABLE TO MOVE.

01:29:40.775 --> 01:29:42.977
MONEY FROM ONE THING TO ANOTHER

01:29:43.044 --> 01:29:44.412
WE SAW LOTS OF HEALTH CLINICS

01:29:44.479 --> 01:29:45.980
HAVING TO MOVE LARGE AMOUNTS OF

01:29:46.047 --> 01:29:48.316
MONEY. INTO MASKS AND SAFETY

01:29:48.382 --> 01:29:51.753
EQUIPMENT- WITHOUT HAVING TO GO

01:29:51.819 --> 01:29:54.155
THROUGH AND OFTEN THE BORI S.

01:29:54.222 --> 01:29:56.491
AND TIME CONSUMING BUDGET

01:29:56.557 --> 01:29:58.826
MODIFICATION PROCESS PROCESS. A

01:29:58.893 --> 01:30:00.061
LOT OF TIMES GOVERNMENT RELIEF

01:30:00.128 --> 01:30:01.562
ON COMES IN THE FORM OF INCOME

01:30:01.629 --> 01:30:03.498
TAX CREDITS AND BECAUSE MOST

01:30:03.564 --> 01:30:05.399
NONPROFITS DON'T PAY INCOME TAX

01:30:05.466 --> 01:30:08.202
THAT'S WHAT TAXES IT MEANS. I'M

01:30:08.269 --> 01:30:10.138
A PAYROLL TAX CREDITS ARE WHAT

01:30:10.204 --> 01:30:11.472
ARE MORE IMPORTANT TO LAST AND

01:30:11.539 --> 01:30:13.007
IN FACT THE E. R. T. SEATING

01:30:13.074 --> 01:30:15.810
PLAN EMPLOYEE RETENTION.

01:30:15.877 --> 01:30:17.845
SOMETHING THAT. ARE IN THE

01:30:17.912 --> 01:30:20.114
FEDERAL PROGRAM DID IN FACT USE

01:30:20.181 --> 01:30:22.150
PAYROLL TAX CREDITS AS AS WAYS

01:30:22.216 --> 01:30:23.785
OF SUPPORTING BOTH SMALL

01:30:23.851 --> 01:30:25.753
BUSINESSES AND NONPROFITS AND

01:30:25.820 --> 01:30:27.421
IT'S A MUCH MORE EQUITABLE AND

01:30:27.488 --> 01:30:29.791
FAIR WAY TO PROVIDE TAX CREDITS.

01:30:29.857 --> 01:30:31.058
AND THEN FINALLY WE KNOW THAT

01:30:31.125 --> 01:30:32.960
GOVERNMENT NEEDS A ROBUST IT

01:30:33.027 --> 01:30:34.529
INDUSTRY AN ECOSYSTEM JUST LIKE

01:30:34.595 --> 01:30:36.430
WE NEED A ROBUST AGRICULTURAL

01:30:36.497 --> 01:30:38.266
SYSTEM AND SUPPLY CHAIN. WE ALSO

01:30:38.332 --> 01:30:40.234
NEED THAT NONPROFITS AND IN

01:30:40.301 --> 01:30:41.502
PARTICULAR WE KNOW THERE ARE

01:30:41.569 --> 01:30:42.870
STILL MANY DISPARITIES IN

01:30:42.937 --> 01:30:49.544
CALIFORNIA. THAT PARTICULARLY IF

01:30:49.610 --> 01:30:50.511
I MEAN IT GOES TO NONPROFIT AND

01:30:50.578 --> 01:30:52.680
WE'RE AREAS INTO OUR AREA AND-

01:30:52.747 --> 01:30:53.381
OF COLOR ARE SPENT. IMPORTANT

01:30:53.447 --> 01:30:54.649
FOR ALL OF US. IS JUST COUPLE OF

01:30:54.715 --> 01:30:56.350
ITS- YOU KNOW- FOR ONE OF THE

01:30:56.417 --> 01:30:58.186
OUR RESEARCH HAS SHOWN IS THAT

01:30:58.252 --> 01:30:59.554
FOR EVERY DOLLAR THAT THE

01:30:59.620 --> 01:31:01.289
METROPOLITAN NONPROFIT HAS A

01:31:01.355 --> 01:31:03.191
RURAL NONPROFIT HAS FIFTY NINE

01:31:03.257 --> 01:31:05.893
CENTS. THAT SHOWS THE DISPARITY

01:31:05.960 --> 01:31:07.762
BETWEEN HOW GOVERNMENT

01:31:07.829 --> 01:31:09.330
FOUNDATION AND INDIVIDUAL

01:31:09.397 --> 01:31:11.499
FINDING IS- IN TERMS OF ALL OF

01:31:11.566 --> 01:31:12.800
THESE AND THEN ONE LAST THING- I

01:31:12.867 --> 01:31:15.169
MET MRS CONTRACTS THAT ALLOW

01:31:15.236 --> 01:31:15.970
NONPROFITS TO COMPETE FOR

01:31:16.037 --> 01:31:19.307
TALENT. THE AVERAGE AMOUNT THAT

01:31:19.373 --> 01:31:21.209
OUR MEALS ON WHEELS GET THAT

01:31:21.275 --> 01:31:23.044
CALIFORNIA MEALS ON WHEELS

01:31:23.110 --> 01:31:24.879
ORGANIZATIONS ARE RECEIVED. FOR

01:31:24.946 --> 01:31:26.948
A MEAL DELIVERED IS FIVE DOLLARS

01:31:27.014 --> 01:31:28.549
AND FIVE CENTS PER DELIVERED

01:31:28.616 --> 01:31:31.152
MEAL. AND IF YOU HAVE A CONTRACT

01:31:31.219 --> 01:31:32.320
WITH THE GOVERNMENT THAT GIVES

01:31:32.386 --> 01:31:34.455
YOU THAT AMOUNT OF MONEY. THE

01:31:34.522 --> 01:31:36.023
ONLY THING YOU CAN DO IS PUSH

01:31:36.090 --> 01:31:38.025
DOWN YOUR WAGES OFTEN TO A POINT

01:31:38.092 --> 01:31:39.393
WHERE YOU CAN'T COMPETE WITH

01:31:39.460 --> 01:31:41.095
OTHERS FOR TALENT AND ALSO THAT

01:31:41.162 --> 01:31:42.864
JUST SIMPLY ISN'T FAIR TO OUR

01:31:42.930 --> 01:31:44.398
EMPLOYEES. SO ALL OF THESE

01:31:44.465 --> 01:31:45.700
THINGS ARE THE THINGS THAT ARE

01:31:45.766 --> 01:31:46.901
IMPORTANT THAT ARE SOME THAT

01:31:46.968 --> 01:31:47.735

VULNERABLE WORK FORCE AND THE

01:34:56.690 --> 01:34:57.958
PANDEMIC HAS HEIGHTENED THIS

PERCENTAGE OF THEIR INCOME

01:35:20.614 --> 01:35:22.616

01:39:33.400 --> 01:39:34.301
AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS

01:39:34.368 --> 01:39:36.270
COMPLETED OR IN THE PIPELINE.

01:39:36.337 --> 01:39:37.371
AND OUR MISSION IS TO END

01:39:37.438 --> 01:39:38.906
HOMELESSNESS FOR INDIVIDUALS

01:39:38.972 --> 01:39:40.841
FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES. WITH

01:39:40.908 --> 01:39:42.276
CLOSE TO A THOUSAND STAFF

01:39:42.343 --> 01:39:44.111
SERVING OVER TWENTY FIVE

01:39:44.178 --> 01:39:44.778
THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS A YEAR

01:39:44.845 --> 01:39:47.581
COVERED NINETEEN IMPACTED US

01:39:47.648 --> 01:39:48.782
GREATLY. TODAY I WANT TO FOCUS

01:39:48.849 --> 01:39:50.918
ON TWO AREAS FOR OPPORTUNITY AS

01:39:50.984 --> 01:39:52.319
WE LOOK AT HOW THE PANDEMIC

01:39:52.386 --> 01:39:53.921
IMPACTED THAT AS WELL AS MANY

01:39:53.987 --> 01:39:55.856
OTHERS LIKE WE'VE HEARD TODAY.

01:39:55.923 --> 01:39:56.690
AND HELP US PREPARE FOR THE

01:39:56.757 --> 01:39:59.226
FUTURE. ONE AREAS ARE WORKFORCE

01:39:59.293 --> 01:40:00.894
AND THE OTHERS ARE OF THE

01:40:00.961 --> 01:40:02.363
CONTRACTING CHALLENGES. I WILL

01:40:02.429 --> 01:40:03.664
START WITH THE CHALLENGES WE'VE

01:40:03.731 --> 01:40:05.466
SEEN MAINTAINING OUR WORKFORCE.

01:40:05.532 --> 01:40:07.301
GOING BACK TO MARCH OF TWENTY

01:40:07.368 --> 01:40:07.801
TWENTY WHEN THE LOCKDOWN

01:40:07.868 --> 01:40:09.103
OCCURRED WE KNEW INSTANTLY THAT

01:40:09.169 --> 01:40:11.572
WE WERE ESSENTIAL WORKERS. I CAN

01:40:11.638 --> 01:40:12.606
STILL REMEMBER EXACTLY WHERE I

01:40:12.673 --> 01:40:14.575
WAS WHEN I HEARD THE NEWS OF THE

01:40:14.641 --> 01:40:15.442
SHUTDOWN AS I'M SURE MANY OF YOU

01:40:15.509 --> 01:40:17.444
CAN AS WELL. BUT WHAT THIS TRULY

01:40:17.511 --> 01:40:19.480
MET FOR US WAS THAT AS THE REST

01:40:19.546 --> 01:40:20.614
OF THE WORLD WAS FIGURING OUT

01:40:20.681 --> 01:40:22.483
HOW THE IMPLICATIONS WOULD. WORK

01:40:22.549 --> 01:40:23.784
WITH THEIR FAMILY OR HOW THEY

01:40:23.851 --> 01:40:25.185
WOULD MEET THEIR BASIC NEEDS

01:40:25.252 --> 01:40:26.053
WITH FOOD AND PAPER GOODS

01:40:26.120 --> 01:40:28.689
SHORTAGES. OUR ENTIRE TEAM HAD

01:40:28.756 --> 01:40:29.490
TO THINK THROUGH THIS FOR

01:40:29.556 --> 01:40:30.858
THOUSANDS OF THE MOST VULNERABLE

01:40:30.924 --> 01:40:33.894
INDIVIDUALS WE SIR. AND WE DID.

01:40:33.961 --> 01:40:35.295
OUR TEAM SET UP THIRTEEN NEW

01:40:35.362 --> 01:40:36.430
INTERN HOUSING SITES IN LESS

01:40:36.497 --> 01:40:38.799
THAN SIX MONTHS. MANY OF THEM

01:40:38.866 --> 01:40:39.800
WITHIN DAYS OF TOURING THE

01:40:39.867 --> 01:40:43.137
FACILITY. WE KNEW THAT IT WAS

01:40:43.203 --> 01:40:43.971
TRULY LIFE OR DEATH. HOWEVER AND

01:40:44.037 --> 01:40:45.839
THIS TOOK A GREAT TOLL ON THE

01:40:45.906 --> 01:40:48.809
STAFF WITH OFTEN LITTLE OR NO

01:40:48.876 --> 01:40:50.043
COMPENSATION INCREASED. IT'S NOT

01:40:50.110 --> 01:40:51.645
LOST ON ME THAT OUR SECTOR IS

01:40:51.712 --> 01:40:53.213
SEEING A SIGNIFICANT TURNOVER.

01:40:53.280 --> 01:40:54.815
ONLY SERVICE HAS ALWAYS HAD A

01:40:54.882 --> 01:40:57.751
HEALTHCARE ROLE. ENTERING HOLDEN

01:40:57.818 --> 01:40:59.386
WE REALLY PUSH THAT TO THE LIMIT

01:40:59.453 --> 01:41:00.521
. HAVING STAFF WORK DIRECTLY

01:41:00.587 --> 01:41:01.355
WITH COMMON POSITIVE

01:41:01.422 --> 01:41:03.690
PARTICIPANTS PROVIDING TESTING

01:41:03.757 --> 01:41:05.159
BREEDING THOSE ESSENTIAL ITEMS

01:41:05.225 --> 01:41:07.094
INTO THE COMMUNITY. WITHOUT A

01:41:07.161 --> 01:41:10.097
LOT OF TRAINING WITHOUT

01:41:10.164 --> 01:41:10.731
IDENTIFYING WHAT EXPERTISE THEY

01:41:10.798 --> 01:41:12.833
NEEDED. AS AN EXAMPLE WE HIRED

01:41:12.900 --> 01:41:14.768
OVER FOUR HUNDRED AND FORTY

01:41:14.835 --> 01:41:15.803
PEOPLE IN TWO THOUSAND AND

01:41:15.869 --> 01:41:18.238
TWENTY ONE. WE HAD OVER THREE

01:41:18.305 --> 01:41:19.306
HUNDRED AND SEVENTEEN STAFF

01:41:19.373 --> 01:41:21.475
LEAVE THE ORGANIZATION AND WE DO

01:41:21.542 --> 01:41:22.443
AN EXIT INTERVIEW WITH EVERY

01:41:22.509 --> 01:41:24.778
PERSON. ALMOST ALL OF THEM CITED

01:41:24.845 --> 01:41:26.680
THEY WERE LEAVING OUR SECTOR.

01:41:26.747 --> 01:41:29.049
AND THE MAJORITY OVER 75% OF THE

01:41:29.116 --> 01:41:30.651
SEPARATIONS AND BARELY BEEN WITH

01:41:30.717 --> 01:41:32.886
US HERE. SO WE NEED TO FIGURE

01:41:32.953 --> 01:41:34.455
OUT HOW TO INVEST IN THE STAFF

01:41:34.521 --> 01:41:36.323
WHO NEVER GAVE UP TO CONTINUE TO

01:41:36.390 --> 01:41:37.891
PROVIDE OUTREACH RUN INTERIM

01:41:37.958 --> 01:41:39.626
HOUSING AND BE THE HOPE FOR

01:41:39.693 --> 01:41:41.628
PEOPLE WHO OFTEN DON'T HAVE ANY.

01:41:41.695 --> 01:41:42.830
WE NEED TO LOOK AT OUR WORK

01:41:42.896 --> 01:41:43.897
FORCE DIFFERENTLY AND ENSURE

01:41:43.964 --> 01:41:44.932
THAT WE HAVE THE TRAINING AND

01:41:44.998 --> 01:41:46.667
PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT THE

01:41:46.733 --> 01:41:47.801
WELLNESS PROGRAMS AND THE

01:41:47.868 --> 01:41:49.970
FLEXIBILITY THAT OUR TEAMS

01:41:50.037 --> 01:41:52.072
RIGHTFULLY DESERVE. AND THE

01:41:52.139 --> 01:41:53.740
SECOND AREA WE WANT TO FOCUS ON

01:41:53.807 --> 01:41:55.509
IS REALLY PREPARING AROUND OUR

01:41:55.576 --> 01:41:57.311
CONTRACT CHALLENGES. THE FIRST

01:41:57.377 --> 01:41:59.146
ONE IS PAY EQUITY AND I THINK IT

01:41:59.213 --> 01:41:59.813
REALLY TIES INTO THE WORK FORCE

01:41:59.880 --> 01:42:01.982
CHALLENGES. HEALTHCARE IS ONE OF

01:42:02.049 --> 01:42:02.883
THE LEADING INDUSTRIES PEOPLE

01:42:02.950 --> 01:42:04.685
ARE LEAVING. WE NEED TO PROVIDE

01:42:04.751 --> 01:42:05.819
A LEAVE LIVING WAGE WHERE PEOPLE

01:42:05.886 --> 01:42:07.421
CAN LIVE AND WORK IN THE SAME

01:42:07.488 --> 01:42:09.857
COMMUNITY. AND OUR STAFF CAN NOT

01:42:09.923 --> 01:42:11.558
BE ELIGIBLE FOR THE SAME

01:42:11.625 --> 01:42:12.092
SERVICES THAT THEY OFFER

01:42:12.159 --> 01:42:14.862
PARTICIPANTS. WE DON'T WANT TO

01:42:14.928 --> 01:42:16.697
PERPETUATE POVERTY. THIS HAS

01:42:16.763 --> 01:42:18.565
COME TO LIGHT EVER EVEN MORE

01:42:18.632 --> 01:42:20.467
THAN EVER DURING THE GLOBAL

01:42:20.534 --> 01:42:21.535
PANDEMIC. BY SETTING ANNUAL

01:42:21.602 --> 01:42:22.936
INCREASES FOR MULTI YEAR

01:42:23.003 --> 01:42:24.805
CONTRACTS. AND SETTING PAY

01:42:24.872 --> 01:42:26.306
STANDARDS BY REGIONAL COST OF

01:42:26.373 --> 01:42:28.775
LIVING STANDARDS. THIS CAN HELP

01:42:28.842 --> 01:42:30.110
RETAIN STAFF IN OUR FIELD.

01:42:30.177 --> 01:42:31.645
ANOTHER ITEM AS DAN MENTIONED IS

01:42:31.712 --> 01:42:34.515
FULL COST FUNDING. TRULY PAYING

01:42:34.581 --> 01:42:35.549
FOR THE FULL COST OF PROVIDING

01:42:35.616 --> 01:42:37.584
THE SERVICE. OFTEN NONPROFITS

01:42:37.651 --> 01:42:38.886
HAVE TO FUNDRAISE TO COVER

01:42:38.952 --> 01:42:39.853
EXPENSES CONTRACTS DO NOT

01:42:39.920 --> 01:42:42.456
PROVIDE. LET'S FUNDRAISE FOR

01:42:42.523 --> 01:42:44.124
INNOVATION NOT BASIC MEANS.

01:42:44.191 --> 01:42:45.526
DURING KOBE AND WE HAVE HAD

01:42:45.592 --> 01:42:47.728
JANITORIAL COSTS TRIPLE IN SOME

01:42:47.794 --> 01:42:48.529
OF OUR INTERN HOUSING AND

01:42:48.595 --> 01:42:51.131
SHELTER FACILITIES. WITHOUT ANY

01:42:51.198 --> 01:42:52.332
INCREASE GOVERNMENT REVENUE.

01:42:52.399 --> 01:42:53.066
CONTRACTS NEED TO BE RE

01:42:53.133 --> 01:42:55.168
EVALUATED FOR TRUE COSTS THERE

01:42:55.235 --> 01:42:56.904
NEEDS TO BE CONTRACTED BEYONCE'S

01:42:56.970 --> 01:42:58.305
WE SHOULD NOT BE WAITING FOR

01:42:58.372 --> 01:42:59.773
LENGTHY REIMBURSEMENTS AND SOME

01:42:59.840 --> 01:43:01.508
OF OUR LOCAL JURISDICTIONS AND

01:43:01.575 --> 01:43:03.577
FIGURE THIS OUT. ADDITIONALLY

01:43:03.644 --> 01:43:04.745
ALLOWING FLEXIBILITY BETWEEN THE

01:43:04.811 --> 01:43:06.480
LINE ITEMS IT'S BEEN STATED

01:43:06.547 --> 01:43:07.514
SPECIALLY DURING A STATE OF

01:43:07.581 --> 01:43:09.182
EMERGENCY WOULD ALLOW US OFTEN

01:43:09.249 --> 01:43:10.684
THE SAFETY NET AND COMMUNITIES

01:43:10.751 --> 01:43:12.719
TO ADAPT TO THE EMERGENCY

01:43:12.786 --> 01:43:13.320
WITHOUT WORRYING ABOUT CLOSING

01:43:13.387 --> 01:43:15.822
OUR DOORS. WE NEED TO LOOK FOR

01:43:15.889 --> 01:43:16.557
OPPORTUNITIES FOR CAPACITY

01:43:16.623 --> 01:43:18.292
BUILDING I KNOW THAT NOT

01:43:18.358 --> 01:43:19.459
EVERYONE WANTS TO FUND CAPACITY

01:43:19.526 --> 01:43:21.361
BUILDING. BUT WHAT WE'VE SEEN IS

01:43:21.428 --> 01:43:23.030
THAT THIS WOULD GREATLY INCREASE

01:43:23.096 --> 01:43:24.898
OUR ABILITY TO RESPOND QUICKLY.

01:43:24.965 --> 01:43:26.166
MANY OF US GREW DURING THE

01:43:26.233 --> 01:43:28.268
PANDEMIC NOT BECAUSE WE WANTED

01:43:28.335 --> 01:43:29.336
TO BUT BECAUSE WE ROSE TO THE

01:43:29.403 --> 01:43:31.071
CHALLENGE. AND YET THIS QUICK

01:43:31.138 --> 01:43:32.973
GROWTH CAUSES A RACE TO KEEP UP

01:43:33.040 --> 01:43:34.875
WITH THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT'S

01:43:34.942 --> 01:43:36.843
NEEDED TO SUPPORT OUR PROGRAMS.

01:43:36.910 --> 01:43:38.312
THE SUMMARIZE WE LEARNED SO MUCH

01:43:38.378 --> 01:43:39.947
DURING THIS PANDEMIC AND HAD AN

01:43:40.013 --> 01:43:42.215
OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE CHANGES. NOW

01:43:42.282 --> 01:43:44.184
WE HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY- THAT

01:43:44.251 --> 01:43:45.285
WILL BETTER PREPARE US FOR THE

01:43:45.352 --> 01:43:47.854
FUTURE. SO LET'S NOT GET STUCK

01:43:47.921 --> 01:43:49.022
UNPREPARED AGAIN LET'S PLAN FOR

01:43:49.089 --> 01:43:50.223
THE NEXT EMERGENCY BECAUSE WE

01:43:50.290 --> 01:43:51.925
KNOW WHEN OUT MORE THAN EVER.

01:43:51.992 --> 01:43:53.627
THAT WE WILL NEED TAX SWIFTLY

01:43:53.694 --> 01:43:54.695
AND THEN OUR NONPROFIT SECTOR

01:43:54.761 --> 01:43:56.063
WILL CONTINUE TO MEET THE NEEDS

01:43:56.129 --> 01:43:57.764
OF OUR COMMUNITY. I REALLY

01:43:57.831 --> 01:44:00.233
APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO

01:44:00.300 --> 01:44:01.368
