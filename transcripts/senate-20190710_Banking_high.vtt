TO CONSUMERS GOING TO OTHER

00:09:29.402 --> 00:09:30.269
SITES.

00:09:30.336 --> 00:09:32.138

DEFINITION IS MESSED UP.

00:10:21.954 --> 00:10:24.523
BUT THE THE PROBLEM THAT WE FACE

00:10:24.590 --> 00:10:26.926
IS LEAD JEN SOUNDS SIMPLE ON THE

00:10:26.993 --> 00:10:29.362

JUST SAYING WE CAN MEET THESE

00:11:57.850 --> 00:11:59.452
OBJECTIVES THIS COMES DOWN TO A

00:11:59.518 --> 00:12:01.420
TECHNICAL ISSUE THAT MAKES OUR

00:19:10.415 --> 00:19:12.885
CONCERNS MOVING FORWARD AND A

00:19:12.951 --> 00:19:15.454
PREPARATIONS UNFORTUNATELY THOSE

00:19:15.521 --> 00:19:17.923
ISSUES WERE RESOLVED LAST YEAR.

00:19:17.990 --> 00:19:19.625
WHEN HE GOT TO APPROPRIATIONS

00:19:19.691 --> 00:19:20.993
AND I BELIEVE THE BILL -- WAS

00:19:21.059 --> 00:19:22.895
HEALED -- FOR THOSE REASONS AND

00:19:22.961 --> 00:19:24.830
MAYBE SOME OTHER ONCE AGAIN

WE'RE HERE A YEAR LATER AND IT'S

00:19:26.331 --> 00:19:28.333
THE SAME MEASURE BEFORE US THAT

00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:29.601
WE DEALT WITH.

00:19:29.668 --> 00:19:31.436
BEFORE IN THE SAME TWO ISSUES

00:19:31.503 --> 00:19:33.472
ARE STILL OUTSTANDING THE TIMING

00:19:33.539 --> 00:19:35.440
OF PROVIDING CONSUMER DISCLOSURE

00:19:35.507 --> 00:19:37.676
INFORMATION AND CLARIFYING THE

00:19:37.743 --> 00:19:39.912
BILLS APPLICATION TO TRIBES AND

00:19:39.978 --> 00:19:42.114
DESPITE THE DILUTION THERE I

00:19:42.180 --> 00:19:43.348
STILL DON'T BELIEVE BASED ON THE

00:19:43.415 --> 00:19:44.783
TESTIMONY WE'VE HEARD TODAY AN

00:19:44.850 --> 00:19:46.285
OPPOSITION THAT IT IS TRUST.

00:19:46.351 --> 00:19:48.453
THE TRIBAL CONCERNS -- THIS

00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:49.755
COMMITTEE ALSO ONCE AGAIN

00:19:49.821 --> 00:19:51.256
OFFERED UP TWO SETS OF

00:19:51.323 --> 00:19:53.959
AMENDMENTS THAT HE RESPECTIVELY --

00:19:54.026 --> 00:19:56.428
REJECTED AND I RESPECT THAT AND

00:19:56.495 --> 00:19:59.298
NO ANIMOSITY THERE BUT BEING THE

00:19:59.364 --> 00:20:00.699
CASE I CAN'T SUPPORT TO MEASURE

00:20:00.766 --> 00:20:03.101
THE DAY I HAVE NO RECOMMENDATION

00:20:03.168 --> 00:20:05.737
FOR YOUR BILL -- WITHOUT THOSE

00:20:05.804 --> 00:20:07.439
TWO RECOMMENDATIONS THAT AGAIN

00:20:07.506 --> 00:20:09.775
WERE MADE A LAST YEAR -- BY THIS

00:20:09.841 --> 00:20:12.077
COMMITTEE AND WAS SUPPORTED BY

00:20:12.144 --> 00:20:14.246
THIS COMMITTEE AND ALLOWING YOUR

00:20:14.313 --> 00:20:16.682
BUILD A MOVE FOR LAST YEAR SO.

00:20:16.748 --> 00:20:17.783
THAT'S WHERE I AM AS IT STATES

00:20:17.849 --> 00:20:19.418
TODAY IF -- MEMBERS ARE INCLINED

00:20:19.484 --> 00:20:21.053
TO MAKE A MOTION FOR THIS BILL I

00:20:21.119 --> 00:20:23.221
KNOW WHICH BACKED OUT BUT I WILL

00:20:23.288 --> 00:20:23.822
NOT BE VOTING FOR THE MEASURE

00:20:23.889 --> 00:20:24.389
TODAY.

00:20:24.456 --> 00:20:25.958
AND I JUST WANT TO COMMENT ON

00:20:26.024 --> 00:20:29.094
THAT I APPRECIATE A WE BUT

00:20:29.161 --> 00:20:29.728
EVERYBODY HAS IN FRONT OF THEM

00:20:29.795 --> 00:20:31.096
ARE.

00:20:31.163 --> 00:20:34.232
THERE ARE TEN SETS OF AMENDMENTS

00:20:34.299 --> 00:20:35.834
THAT WE'VE TAKEN SINCE LAST YEAR --

00:20:35.901 --> 00:20:37.803
ALL OF THEM HAVE INSISTS THERE I

00:20:37.869 --> 00:20:39.972
THINK THE POSITION FOR ME AS THE

00:20:40.038 --> 00:20:51.149
AUTHOR OF THE BILL IS DO I TAKE

00:20:51.216 --> 00:20:53.118
THE THE FINAL.

00:20:53.185 --> 00:20:54.119
TWO OUR ISSUES THAT HAVE TO DO

00:20:54.186 --> 00:20:55.087
WITH THE DISCLOSURES AND WHO

00:20:55.153 --> 00:20:55.721
PROVIDES THE DISCLOSURES -- AND

00:20:55.787 --> 00:20:56.288
WE ABSOLUTELY DO NOT HAVE A

00:20:56.355 --> 00:20:57.489
RESOLUTION ON THAT AS WELL AS

00:20:57.556 --> 00:20:58.090
THE TRIBAL LANGUAGE WHICH THE

00:20:58.156 --> 00:20:58.757
AMENDMENTS REMOVE ALTOGETHER IF

00:20:58.824 --> 00:20:59.424
SOMEONE WANTS TRIBAL LANGUAGE IN

00:20:59.491 --> 00:21:00.726
THERE I THINK THAT THERE'S A WAY

00:21:00.792 --> 00:21:02.527
TO GET TO THOSE THINGS -- IF

00:21:02.594 --> 00:21:03.862
THERE IS AGREEMENT FROM THE

00:21:03.929 --> 00:21:05.364
GOVERNOR'S OFFICE THAT THAT'S

00:21:05.430 --> 00:21:06.231
THE LANGUAGE THEY WANT TO SEE

00:21:06.298 --> 00:21:09.001
THEIR SO I THINK IT'S BEEN A

00:21:09.067 --> 00:21:09.801
IT'S BEEN.

00:21:09.868 --> 00:21:11.036
CERTAINLY THE TWO AMENDMENTS

00:21:11.103 --> 00:21:12.437
THAT I DID NOT AGREE TO A YOU

00:21:12.504 --> 00:21:13.939
KNOW AS IT'S BEEN STATED ALSO

00:21:14.006 --> 00:21:15.307
THE ONES THAT ARE HIGHLIGHTED

00:21:15.374 --> 00:21:16.575
OUR AMENDMENTS THAT I'VE TAKEN

00:21:16.642 --> 00:21:17.976
SPECIFICALLY FOR BY THIS

00:21:18.043 --> 00:21:18.877
COMMITTEE.

00:21:18.944 --> 00:21:20.379
THAT HAVE REQUESTED ME THAT HAVE

00:21:20.445 --> 00:21:22.180
REQUESTED OF THE OF ME OF THIS

00:21:22.247 --> 00:21:23.849
BILL -- SO THOSE ARE THE DATES

00:21:23.915 --> 00:21:25.917
THEY TOOK A AMENDMENTS FROM THIS

00:21:25.984 --> 00:21:28.153
COMMITTEE IS DO I TAKE THOSE

00:21:28.220 --> 00:21:31.823
AMENDMENTS KNOWING THAT THAT IS

00:21:31.890 --> 00:21:33.425
NOT.

00:21:33.492 --> 00:21:34.760
GOING YOU KNOW.

00:21:34.826 --> 00:21:36.662
THAT DESPITE.

00:21:36.728 --> 00:21:38.897
DESPITE EVERYONE'S INTEREST IN

00:21:38.964 --> 00:21:40.432
WANTING TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT A

00:21:40.499 --> 00:21:43.068
SOLUTION TO THIS -- THE THERE IS

00:21:43.135 --> 00:21:45.570
CONCERN -- AND THEY WOULD LIKELY

00:21:45.637 --> 00:21:46.672
PUT THE POSITION IN A BILL OF

00:21:46.738 --> 00:21:48.273
NOT GETTING SIGNED IN THE FUTURE

00:21:48.340 --> 00:21:50.776
SO I I THINK THAT THAT'S A HARD.

00:21:50.842 --> 00:21:53.145
ONE AND THOSE ARE THE TWO THINGS

00:21:53.211 --> 00:21:54.413
THAT I HAVE.

00:21:54.479 --> 00:21:55.547
IN FRONT OF ME AND IT'S NOT THAT

00:21:55.614 --> 00:21:57.516
IS NOT I MEAN IF WE CAN FIND

00:21:57.582 --> 00:21:58.517
AGREEMENT I WOULD HAVE FOUND

00:21:58.583 --> 00:22:00.519
AGREEMENT WE'VE BEEN TRYING FOR

00:22:00.585 --> 00:22:01.853
EIGHTEEN MONTHS AND CERTAINLY --

00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:03.088
IF THIS BILL DOESN'T MOVE

00:22:03.155 --> 00:22:04.623
FORWARD WILL BE BACK AT IT NEXT

00:22:04.690 --> 00:22:07.626
YEAR -- AS WELL NO AND WE

00:22:07.693 --> 00:22:08.293
RESPECT THAT AND AND I'M ALWAYS

00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:09.661
SAY THIS ISSUE THAT I THINK WE

00:22:09.728 --> 00:22:11.396
ALL FEEL IT'S VITALLY IMPORTANT

00:22:11.463 --> 00:22:12.998
BUT I THINK THERE IS A LITTLE

00:22:13.065 --> 00:22:14.533
BIT MORE CONSENSUS THAT WE COULD

00:22:14.599 --> 00:22:16.034
GET IT'S BEEN EXPRESSED BY

00:22:16.101 --> 00:22:16.968
COMMITTEE MEMBERS.

00:22:17.035 --> 00:22:18.470
FLASHER IN IT'S BEEN EXPRESSED

00:22:18.537 --> 00:22:19.604
AGAIN -- THIS YEAR IT'S BEEN

00:22:19.671 --> 00:22:21.506
EXPRESSED BY THE ADVOCATES AS

00:22:21.573 --> 00:22:22.708
WELL AS OPPONENTS THAT THERE IS

00:22:22.774 --> 00:22:24.409
A A LITTLE BIT MORE OF A SWEET

00:22:24.476 --> 00:22:25.811
SPOT THAT WE CAN REACH ON THIS

00:22:25.877 --> 00:22:27.079
MEASURE WE JUST HAVEN'T REACHED

00:22:27.145 --> 00:22:28.246
A TODAY SO.

00:22:28.313 --> 00:22:30.515
THAT'S WHERE MY POSITION IS BUT

00:22:30.582 --> 00:22:35.787
LIKE I SAY I HAVE NO IDEAL YES.

00:22:35.854 --> 00:22:38.590
CENTER CAPS ARE.

00:22:38.657 --> 00:22:39.891
I APPRECIATE THE THE CHAIR'S

00:22:39.958 --> 00:22:41.259
COMMENTS AND AND THE CONCERNS

00:22:41.326 --> 00:22:41.893
AND I I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO

00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:42.527
WORK ON SOMETHING FOR A REALLY

00:22:42.594 --> 00:22:43.729
LONG TIME TO GET IT TO A

00:22:43.795 --> 00:22:44.963
COMMITTEE AND THEN HAVE SOMEONE

00:22:45.030 --> 00:22:46.998
SAY.

00:22:47.065 --> 00:22:47.599
YOU KNOW WHAT IT'S A TWO YEAR

00:22:47.666 --> 00:22:49.968
BILL -- SO -- I'M SENSITIVE TO

00:22:50.035 --> 00:22:53.872
THAT THE GENTLEMAN THAT SPOKE I

00:22:53.939 --> 00:22:56.041
I'M I APOLOGIZE I MISSED IT.

THE PRESENTATION PRESENTING MY

00:22:56.742 --> 00:23:00.011
OWN BILL IN HE ASSEMBLY BUT BUT

00:23:00.078 --> 00:23:01.780
MY CONCERN IS.

WITH AN OMINOUS SUPPORT THE BILL

00:23:03.381 --> 00:23:06.351

00:23:06.418 --> 00:23:09.054

TO DO WORK IN THE SPACE.

00:23:14.659 --> 00:23:15.827
THE GENTLEMAN WHO SPOKE

00:23:15.894 --> 00:23:17.496
INDICATED THAT HE HAD NOT

00:23:17.562 --> 00:23:19.431
RECEIVED A RESPONSE BACK IN YEAH.

00:23:19.498 --> 00:23:20.732
I DON'T NEED TO GET INTO ALL OF

00:23:20.799 --> 00:23:22.200
THAT BUT I THINK IT'S IT IT

00:23:22.267 --> 00:23:23.468
WOULD BE REALLY GOOD TO HAVE A

00:23:23.535 --> 00:23:24.569
CONVERSATION.

00:23:24.636 --> 00:23:25.971
WITH HIM WHETHER YOU AGREE OR

00:23:26.037 --> 00:23:28.039
NOT WITH HIS POSITION AND AT

00:23:28.106 --> 00:23:29.207
LEAST GIVE THEM A AM AN ANSWER

00:23:29.274 --> 00:23:29.808

HE CAN HEAR FROM YOU WHAT WHAT

WHAT YOUR POSITION IS ON HIS ON

00:23:35.180 --> 00:23:36.782
HIS ON THE FRAMEWORK THAT HE'S

00:23:36.848 --> 00:23:38.683
TALKING ABOUT SO -- LIKE I SAID

00:23:38.750 --> 00:23:40.285
I MISSED A BIG PART OF IT AND I

00:23:40.352 --> 00:23:42.254
DO APOLOGIZE BUT IT IS IMPORTANT

00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:43.855
THIS IS IT THIS IS PARTICULARLY

00:23:43.922 --> 00:23:45.357
SENSITIVE IN IN THE BUSINESS

00:23:45.423 --> 00:23:46.358
FROM BECAUSE YOU WANT TO MAKE

00:23:46.424 --> 00:23:47.526
SURE THAT YOU'RE NOT PUTTING

00:23:47.592 --> 00:23:48.994
PEOPLE OUT OF BUSINESS THAT

00:23:49.060 --> 00:23:49.995
OTHERWISE ARE DOING.

00:23:50.061 --> 00:23:53.131
THE RIGHT THING -- BUT EVERYBODY

00:23:53.198 --> 00:23:54.566
SHOULD HAVE TO PLAY BY THE SAME

00:23:54.633 --> 00:23:59.871
RULES AND SO -- FOR THAT REASON

00:23:59.938 --> 00:24:00.438
I'M I'M WILLING TO SPUR YOU

00:24:00.505 --> 00:24:02.507
TODAY.

00:24:02.574 --> 00:24:04.009

00:24:04.075 --> 00:24:05.911
LIKE.

00:24:05.977 --> 00:24:07.445
IT'S CLOSER.

00:24:07.512 --> 00:24:09.514
EVEN IF IT'S NOT WHERE IT NEEDS

00:24:09.581 --> 00:24:10.982
TO BE A NIGHT I THINK THAT.

00:24:11.049 --> 00:24:12.484

THERE'S A WAY TO GET THERE SO.

00:24:27.933 --> 00:24:30.168
