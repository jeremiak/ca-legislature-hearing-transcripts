ASSEMBLY BILL THIRTEEN NINETY NINE BY SOMETHING MEMBER BLOOM AND ACTUALLY THE RESIDENTIAL REAL PROPERTY. THE SHOVEL THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS THE ELLIS ACT WAS ENACTED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE AND WAS INTENDED AS A MEANS FOR LANDLORDS TO EXIT THE RENTAL HOUSING BUSINESS. BUT NOT AS AN END RUN AROUND LOCAL PROTECTIONS FOR TENANTS -- AND UNFORTUNATELY A LIMITED NUMBER OF LAND YOU LORDS HAVE IMPROPERLY USE THE LAW TO DO JUST THAT. SO THIS BILL MAKES CLARIFYING CHANGES TO THE ELLIS ACT THAT ARE INTENDED TO BOTH ENSURE FAIRNESS FOR TENANTS. AND REMOVE AMBIGUITY FOR BOTH LANDLORDS AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. SOME MY LANDLORDS HAVE BEEN EVICTING TENANTS UNDER THE GUISE OF EXITING THE RENTAL HOUSING BUSINESS BUT ACTUALLY HAVING NO INTENT TO ACTUALLY LEAVE THE MARKET SO INSTEAD THEY'VE GAME THE SYSTEM. TO AVOID. LOCAL PROTECTIONS FOR TENANTS AND TO ADDRESS THESE ABUSES AB THIRTEEN NINETY NINE WILL CLARIFY THE ELLIS ACT IN THE FOLLOWING WAYS. FIRST WHEN A LANDLORD WITHDRAWS A BUILDING UNDER THE ALSO ACT. I IT WILL BE -- CLARIFIED THAT THERE IS ONLY ONE WITHDRAWAL DATE AND ONE DATE FOR RETURNING THE UNITS TO THE RENTAL MARKET. A LANDLORD WILL NO LONGER BE ALLOWED TO PICK AND CHOOSE WHICH UNITS TO RETURN IN WHICH TO NOT. SECOND. THE BILL PROVIDES AN EXCEPTION TO THE ABOVE FOR UNITS THAT ARE OWNER OCCUPIED AT THE TIME OF WITHDRAWAL A PROTECTION FOR LANDLORDS. THIRD THE LAW WILL MAKE CLEAR THAT THE PAYMENT OF A PENALTY DOES NOT EXTINGUISH THE LANDLORDS OBLIGATION TO COMPLY WITH THE LAW. AND FINALLY IT WILL CLARIFY THAT IF A LANDLORD ALLOWS A TENANT WHO NEEDS MORE TIME TO MOVE TO STAY BEYOND THE END OF THE TERMINATION NOTICE. THAT A VOLUNTARY ACTION BY THE LANDLORD DOES NOT EXTEND THE TIME LINE UNDER THAT ACT. WELL I'M HAPPY TO REPORT THAT WE HAVE REACHED AN AGREEMENT WITH THE CALIFORNIA APARTMENT ASSOCIATION THE REALTORS AND OTHER INDUSTRY GROUPS THAT HAVE REMAINED. THAT A REMOVED ALL REMAINING CONCERNS AND WE'LL BE TAKING THESE ADDITIONAL AMENDMENTS IN THE SENATE. THIS BILL GIVES TENANTS SOME SECURITY IN KEEPING THEIR HOMES IN A TIME WHEN HOMELESSNESS FOR OUR POOR SENIORS DISABLED AND EVEN WORKING CLASS. INDIVIDUALS IS A REALITY THAT'S JUST A PAYCHECK OR RENT INCREASE THE WAY TO THE LACK OF READILY AVAILABLE AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MISTER BLOOM.

TWO TWENTY IS A BIPARTISAN BILL. THAT REMOVES BARRIERS TO ANYONE SEEKING TO SERVE IN ELECTED OFFICE BY ALLOWING ANY CANDIDATE TO USE THEIR CAMPAIGN FUNDS FOR CHILD CARE EXPENSES INCURRED AS A RESULT OF CAMPAIGNING. THIS BILL WILL HELP PARENTS WITH YOUNG CHILDREN SERVE IN PUBLIC OFFICE IT WILL ALSO HELP TO ADVANCE MUCH NEEDED GENDER PARITY AMONG OUR ELECTED. OFFICIALS CURRENTLY WOMEN COMPRISE 30% OF THE LEGISLATURE THAT'S ACTUALLY GROWTH OVER LAST SESSIONS TOTAL OF 22%. BUT IT'S CLEAR THESE NUMBERS STILL FALL FAR SHORT OF GENDER PARITY YOUNG PARENTS BRING AN IMPORTANT VOICE THE POLICY DEBATES THEIR VOICES WE NEED TO HEAR MORE. NOT LESS ANYONE WHO CURRENTLY TRIES TO USE CAMPAIGN FUNDS FOR CHILDCARE FACES RISK AND UNCERTAINTY THEY WOULD BE RELYING ON A TWENTY FIVE YEAR OLD INFORMAL ADVICE LETTER. BY THE F. B. B. C. THIS BILL WILL OFFER EVERYONE WHO WANTS TO SEEK AND SERVE IN PUBLIC OFFICE THE OPPORTUNITY. TO CAMPAIGN WITHOUT HAVING TO WORRY ABOUT WHETHER THEY WILL RUN AFOUL OF OUR STATES COMPLICATED AND IN THIS REGARD CERTAIN CAMPAIGN FINANCE LAWS THIS BIPARTISAN BILL. HAS RECEIVE NO NO VOTES THUS FAR SUPPORTED BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU RESPOND TO MISS ROW THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I RISE AS A CO AUTHOR WE ACTUALLY INTRODUCE THE SAME BILL THE SESSION SO WE THOUGHT WE'D WORK TOGETHER -- IN MAY OF LAST YEAR THE FCC RULED THAT CANDIDATES FOR CONGRESS COULD USE FUNDS FOR CHILDCARE. CALIFORNIAN LONG PERMITTED THIS PRACTICE HOWEVER IT NEEDED TO BE CODIFIED. TO EXPOSE WE PERMIT. SPENDING CAMPAIGN FUNDS ON CHILDCARE THIS IN TURN WILL RELIEVE A CANDIDATES NEED TO ASK PERMISSION INDIVIDUALLY AND DRAW SCRUTINY TO THEIR CAMPAIGNS WHILE THE COST OF CHILDCARE ASSISTED SUBSTANTIAL -- ONE TOO MANY PEOPLE IF NOT ALL CALIFORNIANS RAISING A FAMILY -- THIS BILL IS ABOUT ANYBODY WHO WANTS TO RUN FOR OFFICE THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE TO PICK UP THEIR CHILDREN OVER RUNNING FOR OFFICE. AND MANY TIMES I'D LIKE MY WIFE TO ATTEND EVENTS WITH ME BUT WE HAVE TO DIVIDE AND CONQUER SO AS FOR YOUR SUPPORT ON THIS BILL. THANK YOU MISS ROW THIS RUBIO. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I ALSO RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL -- AS A MOTHER OF TWO CHILDREN I KNOW HOW HARD IT IS -- WHEN YOU'RE ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL TRYING TO NAVIGATE THE LONG HOURS -- THAT ARE SPENT AWAY FROM YOUR CHILDREN AND JUST TO BE CLEAR AND I STAYED AT THIS -- AND COMMITTEE THIS THE GRANDPARENTS ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THIS BILL THERE IT IT'S OUR OBLIGATION TO TAKE CARE OF CHILDREN -- BUT THIS IS SPECIFICALLY -- FOR TO CHILD CARE THAT. CANDIDATES HAVE TO SPEND. MONEY ON BECAUSE OF THE SPECIFIC CAMPAIGN RELATED ACTIVITIES I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MS RUBIO MR GALLAGHER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS -- SO WE HAD THIS BILL IN THE ELECTIONS COMMITTEE. AND I I UNDERSTAND WHERE. THE AUTHOR IN THE SUPPORTERS OF THIS BILL ARE COMING FROM CERTAINLY I UNDERSTAND IT VERY WELL HAVING FIVE CHILDREN OF MY OWN. AND UNDERSTAND THE DIFFICULTY. OF OF DOING DOING THIS WORK AND STILL. YOUR TRYING TO BE THERE AND AND HAVE CHILD CARE FOR YOUR CHILDREN -- I'LL MY WIFE -- LIKES TO COME TO A BENCH WITH ME AS WELL AND SO WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT YOU KNOW HOW TO DO THOSE THINGS -- BUT WE'RE RIGHT WHERE I KIND OF FEEL THIS IS IS SOMEWHAT MISGUIDED AND STILL NEEDS. A LOT OF WORK IS FIRST OF ALL THINK ABOUT. ALL THE OTHER. YOUR REGULAR CITIZENS OUT THERE THEY HAVE TO FIGURE THIS OUT TO AND IF THEY DON'T QUALIFY FOR A PROGRAM. THEY DON'T GET ANYBODY TO SUBSIDIZE THEIR CHILD CARE THEY HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO PAY THOSE COSTS. MANY OF OUR OWN STAFF WHO WORK IN THIS BUILDING. DON'T THEY MAKE TOO MUCH TO QUALIFY FOR ANY PROGRAMS. AND NOT ENOUGH IN MANY CASES TO PAY FOR A LOT OF CHILD CARE. SO WHY ARE TO ME THIS BILL IS IN SOME WAYS MAKING AN EXCEPTION FOR US. JUST FOR THE FACT THAT WE HAVE CAMPAIGN FINANCE ACCOUNTS -- TO ALLOW THIS TO BE USED TO THE WE CAN HELP PAY FOR THAT. TO ME. THAT'S A LITTLE BIT MISGUIDED SPECIAL MORE TALKING ABOUT IN THIS CHAMBER THIS YEAR. ABOUT THE HIGH COST OF CHILDCARE IN ABOUT A TRYING TO ENSURE THAT MORE MORE PEOPLE HAVE ACCESS -- I THINK. YOU KNOW TRYING TO DO THIS NOW IN AND SOMETHING THAT'S REALLY MORE HELPING US THAT IT IS NECESSARILY HELPING. OTHERS WHO FACE THIS ISSUE WE ALL HAVE THIS IS THIS IS SOMETHING THAT EVERYBODY FACES HIS APPARENT. AND WHO AND WHO. DOES THESE JOBS AND THEY WHO HAS TO GO OUT INTO THE WORK FORCE AND FIGURE OUT HOW WE GOING TO PAY FOR THAT -- THE OTHER PROBLEM I HAVE WITH THIS BILL AND I THINK THIS IS AN IMPORTANT ONE TO AND AND SHOULD BE THE CAUSE FOR AN AMENDMENT. IS WE'RE SAYING THIS IS FOR CAMPAIGN RELATED ACTIVITIES AND USUALLY. THINGS THAT ARE RELATED TO CAMPAIGNING ARE. ALLOWED TO BE COVERED BY OUR CAMPAIGN FUNDS IN OUR CAMPAIGN ACCOUNTS -- AND I COULD SEE HOW REALISTICALLY. GOING TO AN EVENT GOING OUT CAMPAIGNING -- MAKING SPEECHES THERE MAY BE A TIME WHEN YOU NEED TO HAVE CHILD CARE AND THEN. THAT WOULD BE PART OF A LEGITIMATE CAMPAIGN EXPENSE BUT WHAT THIS ALSO HAS IN HERE IS ALSO IN YOUR OFFICIAL DUTIES. AS AN OFFICE HOLDER. WELL THAT COULD COVER A WHOLE HOST OF THINGS THAT AREN'T NECESSARILY CAMPAIGN RELATED. THEY'RE JUST DOING THIS JOB. WELL EVERYBODY ELSE OUT THERE IN THE REAL WORLD HAS A JOB THAT THEY HAVE TO DO. TO AND I DON'T THINK THAT WORRY ARE MORE SPECIAL. AS I SAID. THEN EVERYBODY ELSE. AND SO TO BE ABLE TO USE CAMPAIGN. FUNDS FOR SOMETHING THAT. IS REALLY A WORK RELATED ACTIVITY NOT NECESSARILY A CAMPAIGN. RELATED ACTIVITY IS A IS A BIG GRAY AREA. AND AGAIN I THINK IT IS A LITTLE BIT OF A YOU KNOW. A LITTLE BIT TONE DEAF -- IN THIS THERE WERE MANY PEOPLE ARE HAVING TO MAKE THESE TOUGH DECISIONS. AND WE'RE SORT OF PROVIDING OUR OWN SELF. A WAY TO SUBSIDIZE THAT. SO I YOU KNOW THIS POINT I CAN'T SUPPORT THIS MEASURE THANK YOU. THANKS GALLAGHER MISS POWER QUE HAN YOUR RECOGNIZE. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I RISE A PROUD CO AUTHOR OF THIS MEASURE. TO ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT BECAUSE ALTHOUGH. I AM A MOTHER OF THREE KIDS AND ALTHOUGH MY SPOUSE COMING WITH ME IS IMPORTANT I THINK THAT ONE OF US NEEDS TO RISE TODAY AND SPEAK FOR THE PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE SPOUSES. THE PEOPLE WHO NEED TO RUN FOR OFFICE AND DON'T HAVE THAT SUPPORT NETWORK AT HOME THIS BODY SHOULD BE A REFLECTION OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS AMAZING WOMEN AND MEN IN IT WHO ARE RAISING CHILDREN ON THEIR OWN. AND WE NEED TO WORK TO GET THOSE PEOPLE SITTING AT THESE TASKS IN VOTING ON THE THINGS THAT MATTER TO EVERY CALIFORNIAN AND THIS IS A SMALL STEP IN MAKING SURE THOSE PEOPLE CAN RUN FOR OFFICE. THEY CAN REPRESENT THEIR CONSTITUENTS AND THEY CAN HAVE A VOICE IN THE ISSUES THAT WE VOTE ON DAY IN AND DAY OUT. AND SO I AM PROUD TO CO AUTHOR THIS I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE AND I ASK THAT WE CONTINUE TO WORK TO MAKE THIS BODY MORE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THANK YOU. THANK WAS BAR CAM MS GONZALEZ. THANK YOU AND I WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUE BUT WHEN I ACTUALLY RAN FOR OFFICE I WAS A SINGLE MOM WITH YOUNG KIDS. AND I MY KIDS WENT EVERYWHERE WITH ME LARGELY BECAUSE THAT WAS THE ONLY OPTION I HAD. AND WHEN WE TALK ABOUT HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO HAVE TRUE DIVERSITY IN ON THIS FLOOR. TO DIVERSITY GOES BEYOND GENDER AND RACE IT GOES TO LIFE CIRCUMSTANCE AND I THINK THE FACT THAT I WAS A SINGLE MOM MAKES ME A BETTER LEGISLATOR I THINK IT MADE IT. ENSURES THAT I AM MORE AWARE OF THE TYPE OF PEOPLE WERE WORRIED ABOUT OFFENDING A SUPPOSEDLY -- THAT THAT DON'T HAVE THOSE OPPORTUNITIES I AM CONFIDENT THAT YOU COULD ASK ANY. WORKING FAMILY WORKING SINGLE MOM ESPECIALLY MY DISTRICT OF WHETHER OR NOT I SHOULD BE ABLE TO USE CAMPAIGN FUNDS TO PAY FOR CHILD CARE AND THEY SAY ABSOLUTELY. AND BY THE WAY THE THING THAT'S A LITTLE OFF IS WE COULD ACTUALLY USE CAMPAIGN FUNDS TO PAY FOR CHILDCARE OVERALL AT AN EVENT. TO SERVE OTHER PEOPLE'S KIDS OUR OWN STAFF KIDS BUT NOT FOR OURSELVES WITHOUT SOME CLARITY. IT WE'RE NOT LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE IF I HAVE A FRIEND WHO OWNS A CHILD CARE FACILITY THEY SAID THAT'S OKAY LEAVE YOUR KIDS WITH ME. FEW NIGHTS A WEEK AND IT IT IT'S NO PROBLEM THAT IS A PROBLEM BECAUSE WE'RE NOT ALLOWED TO TAKE THAT GIFT. SO WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO ENSURE THAT THERE'S TRUE DIVERSEY ON THIS FLOOR THAT INTO CLUES DIVERSITY OF CLASS AND CIRCUMSTANCE. AND I'D SAY THAT THIS IS ONE STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION I'M PROUD TO BE A CO AUTHOR AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR MY VOTE. THANK YOU MS CONSOLES MISS MELENDEZ. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER ON LEASING GENTLEMAN I I'M A PARENT TO LIKE MANY OF YOU IN HERE I HAVE FIVE KIDS MYSELF WHEN I RAN FOR OFFICE MY KIDS WERE ALL. FAIRLY YOUNG AND WE DID NOT -- WE MADE IT WORK AND I REALIZE THAT NOT EVERYONE CAN DO THAT ARE RUNNING FOR OFFICE IS A CHOICE. IT'S VOLUNTARY NOBODY HAS TO RUN PROP ISSUE NOT DRAFTED INTO THE POSITION. AND SO YOU HAVE TO MAKE ARRANGEMENTS LIKE YOU WOULD ANY OTHER JOB. TO MAKE ARRANGEMENTS FOR CHILD CARE. AND THOUGH IT'S NOT TAXPAYER MONEY IS COMING FROM DONORS -- I JUST I I DON'T SEE THIS AS AN APPROPRIATE -- EXPENSE I THINK IT MAKES US LOOK ELITIST I THINK IT MAKES US LOOK LIKE WE'RE PRIMA DONNAS BECAUSE WE THINK THAT WE DESERVE. TO HAVE SPECIAL TREATMENT IS SPECIAL CHILD CARE AND HAVE THAT FUNDED BY SOMEONE OTHER THAN OURSELVES. PARTICULARLY WHEN YOU THINK OF ALL THE OTHER PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO ARE TRYING TO PAY THEIR CHILD CARE BILLS YOU DON'T HAVE A SEPARATE ACCOUNT OF DONORS THAT THEY CAN USE. TO PAY -- FOR THAT CHILD CARE SO RESPECTFULLY THOUGH I I APPRECIATE WHAT THE AUTHORS ARE -- TRYING TO DO. I I'M NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THIS BILL THANKS. THANK YOU MS ONE THIS IS BURKE YOUR RECOGNIZE -- I'D LIKE TO FIRST I LIKE TO THINK THE AUTHOR I'D LIKE TO THINK MY COLLEAGUES THAT SPOKE ABOUT SINGLE MOTHERS HERE ON THIS FLOOR. AS A SINGLE MOTHER TODAY AS I CAME TO THIS FLOOR MY DAUGHTER WAS BORN BETWEEN MY GENERAL MY PRIMARY. I WASN'T SINGLE AND SO I KNOW BOTH SIDES OF THIS COIN. I KNOW HOW CHALLENGING THIS PLACE HAS BEEN AS I HAVE BECOME SINGLE AND WHETHER THAT WAS ME HAVING TO GO BUY A CAR SO THAT I COULD PARTICIPATE HERE OR IT IS ABOUT MY DAUGHTER BEING ALLOWED TO BE IN THIS SPACE. I LOVE BEING A LEGISLATOR I AM GOOD AT IT AND YOU'RE RIGHT IT IS MY CHOICE. IT'S MY CHOICE TO BE HERE. BUT IF WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A DIVERSITY IS A PERSPECTIVE ON THIS FLOOR THEN WE MUST BE ABLE TO AS PARTICIPANTS HERE SUPPORT EACH OTHER. AND ONE OF THE WAYS WE DO THAT IS BY VOTING FOR THINGS LIKE THIS. TONE DEAF I DON'T THINK THIS IS TONE DEAF. I DON'T THINK THIS MEASURES TONE DEAF AND ANYWAY. I THINK OF THOSE WHO BELIEVE THAT SINGLE MOTHERS DON'T FACE CHALLENGE ARE TONE DEAF. THOSE WHO BELIEVE THAT SINGLE MOTHERS DON'T BELONG HERE ARE TONE DEAF. WE FACE A SEPARATE SET OF CHALLENGES AND MY COLLEAGUES ARE RIGHT. IT MAKES US BETTER LEGISLATORS IT REMINDS US WHEN WE VOTE ON THE BILL'S LIKE WE DID LAST WEEK -- LIKE TO VOTE ON THE BILL'S LIKE WE WILL THIS WEEK. WE HAVE AN EXPERIENCE THAT WE CAN BRING TO THOSE VOTES. I HAVE FACE THE CHALLENGES ON THIS FLOOR FOR THE LAST FEW YEARS AS A SINGLE MOTHER I APPRECIATE. THE AUTHOR FOR THIS BILL BECAUSE EVERY TIME THAT I GET SOMEBODY WHO UNDERSTANDS WHAT IT IS LIKE TO BE AWAY FROM MY DAUGHTER THIS ISN'T A NORMAL JOB. MONDAYS THROUGH THURSDAYS I AM TAKEN AWAY FROM MY HOME. LAST YEAR WE HAD TO PASS A BILL SO THAT MY CHILD COULD BE HERE WITH ME AND GO TO SCHOOL HERE WITH ME WE ARE -- BALDING AS A BODY AND THIS IS JUST PART OF THAT EVOLUTION I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE.

MS RESPECT I KNOW HOW YOU DO IT BUT THIS IS A SMALL PIECE TO USE THAT. A FOR THOSE FOLKS IN THE LATE WE'RE EVOLVING WE'RE CHANGING. YOU KNOW MORE PARENTS MORE WOMEN HERE. DIFFERENT TIMES IT'S OKAY TO CHANGE THINGS. SO I COMMEND YOU LIKE I SAID IT GOES BACK -- TO DOING ALL THE GOOD WORK FOR THE STATE.

MISTER CUNNINGHAM. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER. MEMBERS TODAY I'D LIKE TO PRESENT AB THIRTEEN NINETY FIVE THE ANTI EAVESDROPPING ACT. PRIVACY IS A RIGHT IN OUR STATE CONSTITUTION. OUR PENAL CODE PROTECT PRIVACY BY MAKING IT A CRIME A CRIME MEMBERS TO RECORD A CONVERSATION. WHERE THERE IS AN EXPECTATION OF PRIVACY WITHOUT CONSENT? THE THIRD AND FOURTH AMENDMENTS TO OURS CONSTITUTION AND THE BILL OF RIGHTS. PROTECT. THE HOME FROM UNWARRANTED GOVERNMENT INTRUSION. RIGHT NOW THERE'S A NEW THREAD EMERGING TO OUR PRIVACY RIGHTS. THIS NEW TECHNOLOGY SPORTS SPEAKERS ARE WONDERFUL DEVICES THEY IMPROVE OUR LIVES AND THEY HAVE THE CAPABILITY TO IMPROVE OUR HOMES AND OUR AND OUR QUALITY OF LIFE EVEN MORE. BUT IS COME TO PASS AND IT IS COME TO LIGHT. THAT THOSE DEVICES ALSO ARE A THREAT TO OUR PRIVACY BECAUSE THEY CAN AND DO RECORD CONVERSATIONS. THAT ARE PRIVATE WITHIN OUR HOME AND THAT THEY HAVE THE CAPACITY TO HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS SHARED. AND SOLD WITHOUT OUR CONSENT. THAT IS WHAT MY BILL SEEKS TO PREVENT. THERE IS NO WHERE WHERE THE RIGHT TO PRIVACY IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN IN OUR HOMES THAT'S WHERE WE HAVE OUR MOST IMPORTANT CONVERSATIONS OF OUR LIVES. WE TELL OUR KIDS TO PICK UP THE ROOMS. WHEN THEY DON'T WE YELL AT THEM TO PICK UP THE ROOMS? WE DISCUSS POLITICS. WE WATCH FOX NEWS SOME OF US WE WATCH CNN OTHERS WE ALL THE TV WE DEBATE WE ARGUE. WE HAVE THESE PERSONAL CONVERSATIONS WITHIN THE SECTOR OF OUR HOMES BECAUSE WE PROTECT AND TRUST THAT THEY'RE NOT GONNA BE RECORDED WITHOUT OUR CONSENT BUT THAT IS HAPPENING. I'D I COMMIT TO YOU AND I'VE COMMITTED TO MANY MANY MEMBERS ON THIS. FOR WE WILL WORK ON THIS BILL WE WE HAVE ENGAGE WITH INDUSTRY WE HAVE ENGAGE WITH STAKEHOLDERS. AND I WILL NOT BRING A BILL BACK FROM THE SENATE. UNLESS WE HAVE FIXED ALL THE ISSUES THAT REMAIN WITH IT. AND WE PRODUCED IT TO ITS CORE INTENT WHICH IS TO RESTORE THE BASELINE OF TRUST. THAT WE ALL HAVE AND NOT BASED ON A TRUST MEMBERS IS IS GOING TO ALLOW THESE DEVICES TO DEVELOP AND FLOURISH THAT TRUST HAS BEEN BREACHED. WE NEED TO RESTORE IT THIS IS A POSITIVE STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. AND I THINK IT'S TIME WE GIVE CONSUMERS BACK THE CONTROL AND THE CHOICE. SO THAT WHEN THEY CHOOSE TO BRING A SPEAKER INTO THEIR HOME. THEY KNOW WHAT THEY'RE GETTING INTO. AND THEY CAN CONSENT BEFORE THEY ARE RECORDED. THIS AS A BIPARTISAN AUTHORSHIP IT CAME OUT OF PRIVACY COMMITTEE IT'S NOW BETTER WORK PRODUCT. WE'RE STILL REFINING IT. AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE BOAT. THANK YOU MISTER CUNNINGHAM IS WORKS YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND COLLEAGUES I RISE AS A CO AUTHOR OF THIS BILL IN STRONG SUPPORT FOR THIS BILL AND IT'S A VERY SIMPLE BILL. IT BASICALLY SAYS THAT IF YOU'VE A VOICE RECORDER IN YOUR HOUSE. THAT YOU GIVE CONSENT FOR THIS RECORDER TO RECORD YOUR CONTENT AND THAT YOU KNOW IF THAT COMPANIES GOING TO SHARE THAT INFORMATION. IT'S A PRETTY SIMPLE WILL IT'S A BASIC PRIVACY -- CONSUMER PROTECTION BILL THAT I THINK IS NECESSARY AS TECHNOLOGY INNOVATES AND I USED TECHNOLOGY I'M A CONSUMER OF THESE TECHNOLOGIES AS WELL. WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR OUR OUR OUR CUSTOMERS AND OUR CONSTITUENTS AND OUR VOTERS KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH THIS DATA. AND AND AND CONSENT TO WHAT IS HAPPENING IT'S A VERY SIMPLE BILL I AM HONORED TO WORK WITH MY COLLEAGUES ON THIS AND I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MS WITH MISS ROBIN ULTI CORRECTNESS THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I RISE IN RELUCTANT OPPOSITION TO AB. THIRTEEN NINETY FIVE AS STATED. RIGHT NOW THIS BILL WOULD PROHIBIT THE SALE OF VOICE ACTIVATED SPEAKERS IN CALIFORNIA. AND I KNOW EVERYONE SAYING NO NO WAIT THAT'S NOT WHAT THE BILL SAYS BUT I KNOW OF WHAT I SPEAK SO IN REAL LIFE I OWN A SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COMPANY AND ABOUT TEN YEARS AGO WE DID. A VOICE ACTIVATED TOY THAT YOU COMMUNICATED WITH BY SPEAKING TO IT. AND SO I'VE WRITTEN A SOFTWARE THAT INTERFACES WITH ONE OF THE EARLY VOICE ACTIVATION SHIPS UNDER THE CURRENT PRODUCTS OR AN ORDER OF MAGNITUDE MORE SOPHISTICATED THAN WHAT WE DID TEN YEARS AGO BUT I KNOW ABOUT THE SONG THE THE THE PROCEDURES THAT YOU'D HAVE TO GO THROUGH. TO FIGURE OUT WHAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING. AND THE PROBLEM WITH THIS BILL STEMS FROM THE INCLUSION OF A SINGLE WORD OF THE BILL WHICH IS THE WORD RETAIN. I HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH PROHIBITING. THE SALE OR THE SHARING OF INFORMATION WITH THIRD PARTIES I THINK THAT THAT IS APPROPRIATE BUT NOT ALLOWING THE DEVICE TO RETAIN A USER'S VOICE RECORDED ON THE DEVICE. WOULD PROHIBIT THE VOICE FROM -- THE DEVICE FROM FUNCTIONING AT ALL AND IRONICALLY ONE OF THE SITUATIONS THAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT WITH THIS BILL WAS HEARD AND PRIVACY. WAS THE FACT THAT THERE IS CONCERN THAT WHEN YOU SPEAK THE WAKE WORD. TO A DEVICE THAT THAT WOULD THE VOICES IN THE DEVICES SUPPOSED TO WAKE UP AND START LISTENING TO WHAT YOU HAVE TO SAY AND THERE'S CONCERN THAT SOMETIMES. THE DEVICE THINK SAID HERE'S THE WAKE WORD BUT IT ACTUALLY DIDN'T. AND SO WE CAN RECORD THINGS THAT ARE INAPPROPRIATE RIGHT I THINK THAT THAT IS A VALID CONCERN BUT IRONICALLY PROHIBITING THE DEVICE FROM RETAINING YOUR VOICE AND LEARNING FROM YOUR VOICE AND GETTING TRAINED IN. WHAT YOU SOUND LIKE WHEN YOU SAY THE WAKE WORD MAKES IT A LOT MORE LIKELY THAT THE DEVICE WILL WAKE UP AT AN APPROPRIATE TIME SAID RECORDED APPROPRIATE CONVERSATION SO I URGE THE AUTHOR? TO TAKE A SERIOUS LOOK AT THIS I'M IN SUPPORT OF THAT THE ENTIRETY OF THE REST OF THE BILL EXCEPT THAT THAT ONE PART RETAIN I'VE SERIOUS TECHNICAL PROBLEMS WITH SO FOR NOW I ORIGINAL VOTE. THANK A MEASURE OF REALTY DOCTOR QUIRK YOU ARE RECOGNIZED ALL RIGHT. I HAVE THE SAME CONCERNS AS MR OBERNOLTE BUT I ARJUN AYE VOTE. I WENT OVER AND TALKED TO THE AUTHOR AND EXPLAIN TO HIM THAT IF YOU DON'T ALLOW SOMETHING TO BE STORED YOU CAN'T UNDERSTAND. THAT PERSON'S VOICE FURTHER ALL THOSE STORED VOICES THEY USE A I'D. TO DETERMINE. THE BEST WAY TO INTERPRET PEOPLE WITH ACCENTS AT CETERA AND IT JUST GETS BETTER AND BETTER IF YOU STORAGE. WHAT THE PROBLEM IS IS THEN GIVING IT TO SOMEONE ELSE I HAVE SPOKEN WITH THE AUTHOR? I BELIEVE HE UNDERSTANDS THIS POINT AS BROUGHT UP BY MR OBERNOLTE. I AGREE WITH THE POINT I BELIEVE THAT THE AUTHOR IS WORKING WITH THE OPPOSITION PLEASE LET THIS BILL GO TO THE SENATE IF IT'S STILL A PROBLEM WHEN IT COMES BACK WE CAN LOOK AT IT THEN. BUT I WOULD URGE KNIFE OF THANK YOU DOCTOR QUIRK SEE NO. ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION ON THE ITEM MISTER MISTER CUNNINGHAM YOU MAY CLOSE IF YOU WISH THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THE INPUT FROM TWO VERY VERY. RESPECTED AND INTELLIGENT MEMBERS OF THIS BODY I THINK THE MEMBER FROM HAYWARD. SAID IT BETTER AND I COULD LET'S KEEP IT MOVING. WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS IN THE SENATE AND I'M TRYING TO STRIKE THAT BALANCE THAT ALLOWS THE TECHNOLOGY TO IMPROVE. SO WE CAN ALL ENJOY THESE DEVICES IN OUR HOME BUT MAKE SURE THAT.

THAT BY THE YEAR TWENTY TWENTY FIVE THE OLDER POPULATION WILL HAVE DOUBLED IN CALIFORNIA AND YET CALIFORNIA HAS A HIGHER ELDER ABUSE RATE. OF ANY STATE IN THE COUNTRY. THIS BILL WOULD SEEK TO IN SMALL PART ADDRESS THAT SITUATION BY EMPOWERING A JUDGE WHEN GRANTING ELDER ABUSE RESTRAINING ORDER.

THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS I PRESENT AB SIX A BILL WHICH CREATES THE BRANCH OF EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION. INCREASING THE CAPACITY IN GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE OF THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION FOR ALL EARLY CHILDHOOD PROGRAMMING. THIS GOVERNMENT STRUCTURE CAME AS A RECOMMENDATION FROM THE SPEAKERS BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION ON EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION. THIS COMMISSION WORKED DILIGENTLY FOR TWO YEARS OF ASSESSING ALL ASPECTS OF THE VERY COMPLEX. EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION STRUCTURE WE HAVE IN CALIFORNIA AND THERE AFTER PREPARED A COMPREHENSIVE REPORT. WITH A LONGER RARE PLANTS TO EXPAND EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION. FROM CHILD CARE TO PRESCHOOL PROGRAMS IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT WE ELEVATE EXISTING GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE. INFRASTRUCTURE TO BE ABLE TO HANDLE THE COMING INFLUX OF PROGRAM EXPANSIONS. THE VERY NATURE OF EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION REQUIRES A VARIETY OF STATE DEPARTMENTS. A MIXED METHODS DELIVERY SYSTEM OF CHILD CARE AND PRESCHOOL AND HAS A DIVERSE ARRAY OF STAKEHOLDERS WITH PARTICULAR NEEDS. THE COORDINATION OF EFFORTS WITHIN THE NEW BRANCH OF EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION WILL ENSURE THAT ALL EARLY CHILDHOOD PROGRAMMING REMAINS COORDINATED AND EFFICIENT. HIGH QUALITY AND SUPPORTIVE OF THE CHILDREN FAMILIES AND PROVIDERS THAT ARE SERVED THROUGH THE SYSTEM. THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT HIGH QUALITY EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION IS THE GREATEST EQUALIZER THE CALIFORNIA SHOULD PROVIDE FOR OUR FAMILIES AND CHILDREN. AND THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE BRANCH OF EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION WILL ENSURE THAT WE PROVIDE THE SOCIO ECONOMICALLY AND DEVELOPMENTALLY TRANSFORMATIVE PROGRAMS. IN AN EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT MANNER.

CALIFORNIA SMALL BUSINESS PLAYS A VITAL ROLE IN THE CONTINUE PROSPERITY OF THE STATE'S ECONOMY ACCOUNTING FOR OVER 83% OF THE NET NEW JOBS CREATED LAST YEAR.

WITH EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES IN THE LABOR MARKET AB TWENTY THREE IS SPONSORED BY THE CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURERS AND TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION AND THE CALIFORNIA WORKFORCE ASSOCIATION.

CLOSE ROLL TIDE ABOUT ICE FIFTY EIGHT NO ZERO THAT MEASURE PASSES FILE ITEM. THIRTY NINE AB THIRTY FIVE BY MISTER KALRA COVERAGE. ASSEMBLY BILL THIRTY FIVE BY FAMILY MEMBER KALRA AND OTHERS AND ACTUALLY TO EMPLOYMENT. MISTER KALRA. THANK YOU -- SPEAKER MEMBERS AB THIRTY FIVE WOULD IMPROVE HOW PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS ARE MADE AWARE OF AND HANDLE CASES OF LEAD POISONING AMONG WORKERS IN CALIFORNIA. AND WOULD HELP PREVENT REPEATED OR PROLONGED INCIDENTS OF LEAD POISONING AND WORKPLACES. LEAD POISONING CAN CAUSE HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE COGNITIVE DIFF A DIFFICULT HE'S RESULT MISCARRIAGES OR PREMATURE BIRTH A PREGNANT WOMAN. AND ALSO CAUSE IRREPARABLE DAMAGE TO OUR NERVOUS SYSTEM AND KIDNEYS. AS WE ALL KNOW LET CAN HAVE PROFOUND AND PERMANENT ADVERSE HEALTH EFFECTS OF BOTH CHILDREN AND ADULTS. AND AT HIGH LEVELS LEAD POISONING CAN BE FATAL. LONG AND REPEATED CASES OF LEAD POISONING ARE ENTIRELY PREVENTABLE BUT THE PROTOCOLS IN PLACE CURRENTLY DO NOT WORK. AT THIS TIME THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH HAS DISCRETION WHETHER SHE REFERRED CASES OF THAT PLAYS INTO CAL OSHA. AS A RESULT MANY EMPLOYEES CAN REMAIN VULNERABLE TO REPEATED LET EXPOSURE FOR INDETERMINATE AMOUNTS OF TIME. WE HAVE EVIDENCE THAT SHOWS WHERE HUNDREDS OF BUSINESSES HAD WORKERS POISONED BY LEAD YEAR AFTER YEAR A PART IN A PUBLIC HEALTH DEPENDS UP BY SAYING THEY'RE WORKING ON THE PROBLEM. THIS LACKS ADMINISTRATION THE LOLLIES TO CASES LIKE THE RECENTLY DISCOVERED GUN RANGE IN MILPITAS WERE SUCH HIGH LEVELS A LETTER BEING SPREAD INTO THE SURROUNDING AREA. THAT THE ADJACENT CHILDREN'S GYMNASTICS CENTER ARE PROTESTING FOR HIGH LEAD LEVELS HAD TO BE SHUTTERED AND THE CHILDREN BEING TESTED FOR LEAD POISONING. AB THIRTY FIVE IS A MODEST AND COMMON SENSE APPROACH TO HELP ENSURE THAT PROPER NOTIFICATIONS AND FOLLOW UP BETWEEN CITY PH AND CAL OSHA ARE MADE. IN ORDER O PROTECT OF PROTECT PRESENT AND FUTURE WORKERS AND THEIR FAMILIES. THIS BILL SIMPLY REQUIRES CAL OSHA INVESTIGATE WORK SITES THAT HAVE WORKERS WITH ELEVATED BLOOD LEAD LEVELS UPON RECEIVING SUCH REPORTS OF THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. IT'S ALSO GOOD FOR BUSINESSES AND EMPLOYERS BECAUSE THEY CAN IDENTIFY ISSUES SOONER RATHER THAN MANY YEARS LATER WHEN IT'S WAY MORE COSTLY FOR THEM TO RECTIFY THE SITUATION OR THEY MAY BE SUBJECT TO LAWSUITS -- FURTHER DOWN THE LINE. WORKER SAFETY SHOULD BE PARAMOUNT NOT JUST TO BUSINESSES BUT ALSO TO THE AGENCIES TASKED WITH PROTECTING THESE WORKERS WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE BOAT.

FORTY THAT IS AB. FORTY FOUR BY MISS FRIEDMAN QUICKLY. ASSEMBLY BILL FORTY FOUR BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRIEDMAN AND ACTUALLY THE FOR PRODUCTS MS FRIEDMAN. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS AB FORTY FOUR WOULD MAKE IT UNLAWFUL TO SELLER MANUFACTURE A NEW FOR PRODUCT IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. NOW TO BE CLEAR MEMBERS FOR IS NOT A BY PRODUCT OF THE MEAT INDUSTRY AND IN FACT THIS BILL DOES NOT. I REPEAT IS NOT BANNED FOR FROM COMMON MEAT ANIMALS FROM SHEEP FROM THE GOATS ARE FROM CAO SIR SHEARLING. AND ANYTHING MADE OUT OF GOAT SKIN. OR CAO FOR COULD STILL BE SOLD OR MANUFACTURED IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA [inaudible] FOR IS MADE FROM THE FOR OF WILD ANIMALS WHICH ARE EITHER TRAPPED IN THE WILD. OR RAISED IN CAPTIVITY. FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE. OF FOR WHICH BECAUSE OF MANUFACTURING AND BECAUSE OF SCIENCE AND ADVANCEMENTS WE KNOW THAT WE CAN MAKE A PERFECTLY ACCEPTABLE IN FACT A PRODUCT THAT CAN PASS IS. FOR THROUGH OTHER MEANS BESIDES ON THE BACKS OF THE SUFFERING OF LIVING BEINGS OF ANIMALS. NOW ALSO TO BE CLEAR. THESE ARE ANIMALS THAT ARE MEETING THEIR DEATH EITHER BY BEING TRAPPED IN THE WILD AND LEFT SOMETIMES FOR DAYS TO LANGUISH TRAPS. AND THE DIRE GROUP TOOK A GRUESOME DEATH OR RACING CAPTIVITY AND UNLIKE WITH DOMESTICATED ANIMALS WILD ANIMALS. ARE BY THEIR NATURE WILD THEY HAVE THEY WANT TO ROME THEY WANT TO MOVE. AND WHEN THEY'RE KEPT IN CAPTIVITY THEY SUFFER. NOW THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA HAVE TOLD US THROUGH THEIR VOTES. THAT THEY VALUE PROTECTING ANIMAL WELFARE THEY HAVE VOTED. TO MAKE SURE THAT FARM ANIMALS HAVE AMPLE ROOM TO MOVE AROUND THEY HAVE VOTED TO MAKE SURE THAT HEN LAYING EGGS. HAVE ENOUGH ROOM TO LIVE. LIVS THAT ARE FREE FROM SUFFERING. BUT YOU CANNOT TELL CALIFORNIANS THAT THE PRODUCTS THAT THEY'RE BUYING. IN A CLOTHING STORE THAT USED USES FOR PRODUCTS IS RAISED TO THE STANDARD TO THE VOTERS HAVE TOLD US THEY WANT AN ANIMAL PRODUCTS. BECAUSE OF THAT MANY OF OUR MAJOR MANUFACTURERS MANUFACTURERS LIKE MICHAEL CORES GUCCI JIMMY CHOO ARMANI BURBERRY CHANEL VERSACE AND OTHERS. HAVE ALL ANNOUNCED THAT THEY ARE NO LONGER USING FOR PRODUCTS IN FACT ONE OF THEM WROTE THAT THEY TRIED TO FIND AN ETHICAL SOURCE. FOR FOR AND WHEN AROUND THE WORLD LOOKING FOR THAT AND COULD NOT FEEL CONFIDENT THAT THERE WAS ANY FOR MANUFACTURE UP TO THE STANDARDS THAT THEIR CUSTOMERS WANTED. AND SO THEY WERE NO LONGER COULDN'T GOING TO USE. FOR SO YOU MAY ASK WHY DO WE NEED THIS OF SO MANY MANUFACTURERS ALREADY TURNING AWAY FROM. FOR THE REASON IS BECAUSE OUR CONSUMERS IN CALIFORNIA WANT TO KNOW THAT WHEN THEY BUY A PRODUCT OFF OF THE SHELVES IT'S SAFE. AND THEY ALSO WANT TO KNOW THAT IF THEY BUY A PRODUCT. THAT USES ANIMALS OF THOSE ANIMALS HAVE BEEN HUMANELY RAISED AND SLAUGHTERED AND WE CANNOT DO THAT WITH FOR PRODUCTS. UNLIKE WITH ANIMALS REYES FOR FOR THERE ARE NO FEDERAL LAWS. DICTATING HOW FOR BEARING ANIMALS ARE SLAUGHTERED. THERE IS NO REGULATION IN THIS INDUSTRY I AM VERY VERY MANY OF OUR FOR PRODUCTS ORIGINATE OVERSEAS WERE OUR LAWS DON'T TOUCH. AND IN COUNTRIES WHERE THEY DO NOT HAVE LAWS AT ALL THAT GOVERN ANIMAL WELFARE. MEMBERS THIS IS AN IMPORTANT BILL FOR THE WELFARE OF ANIMALS AND IT'S ALSO A BILL THAT IS PERFECTLY IN KEEPING WITH THE VALUES OF CALIFORNIA MANY OF OUR MAJOR CITIES SUCH AS LOS ANGELES AND SAN FRANCISCO HAVE ALREADY PASSED BANS. ON FOR NOW I THINK IT'S TIME FOR US TO DO THIS STATEWIDE AND TO SEND A MESSAGE THAT OF ANIMALS ARE GOING TO BE USED IN ANY PRODUCT WE DEMAND THAT THE INDUSTRY SHOW. THAT THEY'RE HUMANELY RAISED AND HUMANELY SLAUGHTERED. BECAUSE THE FOR INDUSTRY IS UNABLE TO DO THAT. I URGE YOU TO VOTE I ON AB FORTY FOUR THANK YOU. THANK YOU REST FRIEDMAN.

ASSEMBLY BILL ONE TWENTY THREE BY SOME REMEMBER MCCARTY AND OTHERS AND ACTUALLY EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION MR MCCARTY. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I AM PLEASED TO PRESENT AB ONE TWO THREE THE PRESCHOOL FOR ALL ACT OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN THIS BILL WILL IMPLEMENT TARGETED UNIVERSAL PRESCHOOL IN CALIFORNIA. YOU KNOW IT MAY SEEM EASY PRESCHOOL FOR ALL AS EASY AS ONE TWO THREE BUT IT'S NOT. AND FRANKLY IT'S TIME HERE IN CALIFORNIA. NO THERE ARE STATES ACROSS THE NATION RED STATES AND BLUE STATES THAT HAVE GONE ALL OUT FOR PRESCHOOL FOR ALL. AND CALIFORNIA'S FRANKLY A LITTLE BIT BEHIND HERE STATES LIKE FLORIDA GEORGIA AND OKLAHOMA ARE LEADING IN THIS EFFORT TO MAKE SURE THAT KIDS HAVE YOU NARAL PERSONAL ACCESS TO EARLY EDUCATION. BEFORE THEY ENTER KINDERGARTEN. THIS BILL ACCOMPLICES THIS WITH A DELICATE BALANCE OF INCREASING ACCESS WILL ALSO FOCUSING ON OUR WORK FORCE. THE MAIN ELEMENTS ARE AS FOLLOWS IT EXPANDS OUR EXISTING STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL INCOME ELIGIBLE THREE AND FOUR YEAR OLDS ARE PROVIDED A SEAT IN OUR EXISTING. PROGRAMS WE INCREASE QUALIFICATIONS FOR FUTURE HEAD PRESCHOOL TEACHERS FOCUSING ON THE WORK FORCE AND QUALITY AND FRANKLY I THINK MOST IMPORTANT FOR ALL OF OUR DISTRICTS. WE EXPAND ELIGIBILITY TO MAKE SURE THAT MIDDLE INCOME FAMILIES HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO GO TO PRESCHOOL BECAUSE WE KNOW WITH EARLY EDUCATION PRESCHOOL COSTS IN THE SAME. AS UC BERKELEY AND UCLA. THERE ARE TOO MANY KIDS FROM FAMILIES THAT ARE TOO RICH TO QUALIFY FOR THE FREE. BUT TOO POOR TO PAY THE ONE TO TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH IT COST FOR FULL DAY PRESCHOOL PROGRAMS IN CALIFORNIA. AND THE TRUTH IS IS TOO MANY OF OUR YOUNGSTERS START KINDERGARTEN BEHIND ND THEY NEVER CATCH UP. THEY NEVER CATCH UP. SO IF WE ARE SERIOUS ABOUT ADDRESSING INCOME INEQUALITY. INTER GENERATIONAL POVERTY. CHILDHOOD POVERTY. THE APPALLING HIGH SCHOOL DROP OUT RATE AND EVEN THE CRUEL PATH TO INCARCERATION THE ISSUES OF THE DAY THEY WERE ATTEMPTING ADDRESS WE MUST GET SERIOUS ABOUT INVESTING IN EARLY EDUCATION. AND MAKE PRE K. FOR ALL A REALITY IN CALIFORNIA. THIS BILL HAS RECEIVED BIPARTISAN SUPPORT TODAY SUPPORTED BY A NUMBER OF EDUCATION EARLY EDUCATION GROUPS ON BEHALF OF THE TEN PLUS JOINT AUTHORS OF THIS MEASURE. I RESPECTFULLY ASK THE RIVAL THANK YOU. THANK YOU WAS REGARDING. MS Là M<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt;.&lt;/c&gt;</u> THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I RISE AS A PRODUCT OF STATE PRESCHOOL IN STRONG SUPPORT OF AB. ONE TWO THREE AS EARLY LEARNING AND CARE HAS REMAINED A PRIORITY FOR MANY OF US. THIS BILL HAS A VERY AMBITIOUS GOAL. DATA HAS SHOWN THAT CHILDREN WHO PARTICIPATE ENRICHMENT PROGRAM BEFORE ENTERING KINDERGARTEN AND MORE READY ARE MORE READY TO LEARN AND PARTICIPATE FULLY IN SCHOOL. OVER THEIR COUNTERPARTS WHO DO NOT. WE ALSO KNOW THAT EARLY LEARNING EXPERIENCES ARE PARTICULARLY BENEFICIAL TO CHILDREN WHO ARE LIVING IN POVERTY. I WANT TO DRAW ATTENTION TO A LONG TERM CITY THAT WAS RELEASED RECENTLY. MORE THAN FIFTY YEARS AGO EDUCATORS AND ROLLED. IN ROLE CHILDREN FROM POOR FAMILIES IN A PRESCHOOL PROGRAM IN MICHIGAN. WHAT IS NOW KNOWN IS THAT PERRY PRESCHOOL PROJECT SHOW THAT EARLY CHILDHOOD INTERVENTION HAVE POWERFUL EFFECTS FOR DISADVANTAGED STUDENTS? THE PROGRAM WAS INITIALLY STARTED TO BOOST THE ACADEMIC SCORES OF KIDS. BUT A FEW YEARS THE DATA SHOWED THAT. IT DIDN'T DO THAT BUT AS RESEARCHERS TRACKED THE KIDS INTO ADULT HOLD INTO ADULTHOOD THE FOUNDED THE KIDS WHO WENT THROUGH THE PROGRAM HAD BETTER LIFE OUTCOMES IN THE KIDS INTO THE CONTROL GROUP. THEY HAD MORE EARNINGS MORE STABLE LONG TERM RELATIONSHIPS LESS TROUBLE WITH THE LAW. BUT MOST INTRINSIC INTERESTINGLY THE RESEARCH CONTINUED AND THE NEW YORK AND THE NEW WORK COMPARES THE CHILDREN OF PARTICIPANTS WHO WENT THROUGH THE PROGRAM WITH THE CHILDREN OF PARTICIPANTS WHO WERE IN THE CONTROL GROUP. SO WHAT WE ARE SEEING MEMBERS IS THE INTERVENTIONS TODAY FOR OUR CHILDREN WILL HAVE GENERATIONAL IMPACT. THE CHILDREN OF PARTICIPANTS ARE HEALTHIER EARNING MORE THEY HAVE BETTER SOCIAL AND EMOTIONAL SKILLS. ARE MORE LIKELY TO GRADUATE FROM HIGH SCHOOL AND GO ON TO COLLEGE. AND THEY ARE ALSO LESS LIKELY TO BE INCARCERATED. EARLY LEARNING AND EARLY LEARNING INTERVENTIONS WORK RESEARCH HAS AND CONTINUES TO PROVE THIS OUR COLLEAGUE FROM START FROM SECOND.

THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER AND MEMBERS AB SIX TWENTY NINE IS A WOMEN'S CAUCUS PRIORITY BILL THAT WILL HELP VICTIMS OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING REBUILD THEIR LIVES. HUMAN TRAFFICKING VICTIMS ARE FORCED TO SUFFER THROUGH A COMBINATION OF PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL VIOLENCE. WHEN THEY LOSE THEIR FREEDOM THEY ALSO LOSE THEIR ABILITY TO WORK A REGULAR JOB AND RECEIVE LEGAL WAGES? AFTER A VICTIM HAS ESCAPED A TRAFFICKING SITUATION THE JOURNEY BACK TO NORMALCY IS INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT. THEY MUST GRAPPLE WITH FINDING HOUSING AND OTHER BASIC NECESSITIES ON TOP OF SEEKING TREATMENT FOR MEDICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES. THEY MAY BE ISOLATED FROM FRIENDS AND FAMILY AND MAY HAVE TO RESETTLE FAR FROM WHERE THEY WERE INITIALLY TRAFFICKED IN ORDER TO BE SAFE AGAIN. THE WAY CURRENT REGULATIONS ARE WRITTEN DOES NOT ACKNOWLEDGE THE CIRCUMSTANCES VICTIMS INDOOR WHILE BEING TRAFFICKED NOR THE CHALLENGES THEY FACE IN RECOVERY. CALIFORNIA'S VICTIM COMPENSATION PROGRAM PROVIDES ASSISTANCE TO VICTIMS WHO HAVE SUFFERED PHYSICAL INJURY OR THE THREAT OF PHYSICAL INJURY AS A RESULT OF VIOLENT CRIME INCLUDING COVERING UNFORESEEN EXPENSES SUCH AS MEDICAL BILLS MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT. FUNERAL AND BURIAL EXPENSES AND INCOME LOSS HOWEVER UNDER TODAY'S LAW HUMAN TRAFFICKING VICTIMS MAY NOT BE COMPENSATED FOR INCOME LOSS. AB SIX TWENTY NINE WILL ALLOW THE CALIFORNIA VICTIM COMPENSATION BOARD TO COMPENSATE HUMAN TRAFFICKING VICTIMS FOR ECONOMIC LOSSES INCURRED AS A RESULT OF BEING TRAFFICKED. WE CANNOT UNDO THE HARM THAT HUMAN TRAFFICKING VICTIMS OF SUSTAINED BUT BY PROVIDING THESE VICTIMS WITH FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE WE CAN RECOGNIZE THE ADVERSITY THEY HAVE UNDERGONE.

WHICH SEEKS TO EXPAND MEDICAL COVERAGE TO INCOME ELIGIBLE UNDOCUMENTED ADULTS. SIMPLY PUT THIS BILL REMOVES A BARRIER TO HELP ACCESS DUE TO IMMIGRATION STATUS. THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS UNJUSTLY IMPOSED. WE KNOW THAT PEOPLE WITHOUT INSURANCE ARE LESS LIKELY TO GET THE MEDICAL CARE THAT THEY NEED. THE FEDERAL INSTITUTE OF MEDICINE PUT IT SUCCINCTLY. UNINSURED PEOPLE ARE MORE LIKELY TO RECEIVE TOO LITTLE MEDICAL CARE AND TO RECEIVE IT TOO LATE. THEY ARE SICKER AND DIE SOONER. I HAVE SEEN THIS FIRST HAND. I WAS ON THE FRONT LINES OF HEALTH CARE AND FEEL THE URGENCY TO FIX OUR CURRENT HEALTHCARE CRISIS. INSTEAD OF BEING ABLE TO RECEIVE CARE IN A TIMELY MANNER TO PREVENT ILLNESSES FROM DETERIORATING MANY UNDOCUMENTED CALIFORNIANS ONLY ACCESS CARE AND EMERGENCY ROOM. WHERE MANY TIMES PHYSICIANS LIKE MYSELF ARE NO LONGER ABLE TO HELP DUE TO THE EXACERBATIONS OF THEIR ILLNESS? I'VE SEEN COUNTLESS CASES IN MY EMERGENCY ROOM IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY IN THE BREAD BASKET OF OUR COUNTRY. WHERE ARE FOUND FARMWORKERS WHO HELPED TO PRODUCE THE FRUIT AND VEGETABLES WHICH BILL OUR TABLES TO SUCH ABUNDANCE? ARE UNABLE TO DO SO FOR THEIR OWN FAMILIES DUE TO THEIR DIRE HEALTH CIRCUMSTANCES. NOT ONLY IS THIS CURRENT STATE OF A AFFAIRS DETRIMENTAL TO THESE INDIVIDUALS.

THANK YOU MISTER GIVES A MISTER CHIU YOU ARE RECOGNIZED ON THIS BILL THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER I RISE AS A JOINT AUTHORED THIS BILL TO THANK OUR COLLEAGUE.

I THINK SINCE THEN -- THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE STATE HAS SEEN DIFFERENTLY THEY UNDERSTAND NOT JUST THE FAIRNESS ISSUE OF THE IDEA THAT IF YOU HAPPEN TO BE BORN ON THE WRONG SIDE OF THE BORDER YOU COULD BE DENIED HEALTH CARE -- BUT WE ALSO KNOW -- THAT IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE HEALTH OF ALL OF OUR COMMUNITIES THAT EVERYONE HAS ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE. WE ALSO KNOW THAT UNDOCUMENTED CALIFORNIANS CONTRIBUTE OVER THREE BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR IN STATE AND LOCAL TAXES AND YET THEY ARE UNJUSTLY EXCLUDED FROM HEALTH AND SAFETY NET PROGRAMS THAT THEY HELP TO FUND -- THESE ARE INDIVIDUALS WHO MAKE UP ONE TENTH OF OUR WORK FORCE AND ONE OUT OF SIX CHILDREN HAVE AN UNDOCUMENTED PARENTS SO WILD. ARE CURRENTLY IN OUR STATE WE ALLOW THOSE CHILDREN JUST RECEIVE HEALTH CARE WHEN THEIR PARENTS DON'T RECEIVE HEALTH CARE IT OBVIOUSLY HAS IMPACTS ON THEM. AND OUR FAMILIES AND WITH THAT I VERY MUCH HOPE THAT EVERYONE CAN SUPPORT A BEFORE.

THAT AMOUNT OF DEBT IS SECOND ONLY BEHIND HOME MORTGAGES AND YET WITH HOME MORTGAGES AND CREDIT CARDS AND MANY OTHER FORMS OF THAT THERE ARE PROTECTIONS IN PLACE FOR THE BORROWERS. NOT TRUE FOR STUDENT LOAN BORROWERS IN FACT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS SERIOUSLY BACKED OFF ON ANY OF ITS CURRENT PROGRAMS OR ANY OF ITS PREVIOUS PROGRAMS. THAT IT WAS WORKING TOWARDS TO PROTECT STUDENT BORROWERS THIS IS A MAJOR. CRISIS THAT STATES ARE NOW HAVING TO STEP INTO THAT VOID. WHAT AB THREE SEVENTY SIX DOES IS FOR CALIFORNIA AND CALIFORNIA BORROWERS CREATE A PROGRAM WHERE THE BAR WORDS THAN GET HOLD OF THEIR RIGHTS HAVE THE STUDENT LOAN SERVICERS ACTUALLY WORKING FOR RATHER THAN AGAINST THE BORROWERS?

THIS WILL NOT REDUCE THE DEBT PER SE OTHER THAN BY GIVING THAT STUDENT BORROWERS THE TOOLS TO REDUCE THEIR INTEREST AND THEIR OBLIGATIONS OVER TIME. SOME OF THE TRICKS THAT THE THAT THE STUDENT LOAN SERVICERS DO IS. TO PUT THE THE LOAN IN ABEYANCE THEREBY CREATING MORE INTEREST FOR THAT STUDENT TO PAY DOWN OVER A LONGER PERIOD OF TIME.
