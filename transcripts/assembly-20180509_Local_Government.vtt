GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR MEMBERS

CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF

00:41:43.968 --> 00:41:47.605 region:rollup2
COUNTIES. I'M RESPECTFULLY

00:41:45.503 --> 00:41:49.340 region:rollup2
OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED AND WE DO

00:41:47.605 --> 00:41:51.342 region:rollup2
APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S INTENT

00:41:49.340 --> 00:41:52.510 region:rollup2
TO CONTINUE WORKING. I'M WITH US

00:41:51.342 --> 00:41:54.712 region:rollup2
AND WE THINK WE'VE ACTUALLY

00:41:52.510 --> 00:41:56.881 region:rollup2
OUTLINED A FAIR COMPROMISE ON

00:41:54.712 --> 00:41:58.149 region:rollup2
INCLUDED IN YOUR ANALYSIS TODAY.

00:41:56.881 --> 00:41:59.684 region:rollup2
I'M BUT ESSENTIALLY ARE OUR

00:41:58.149 --> 00:42:01.019 region:rollup2
PROBLEM IS KIND OF WITH THE CORE

00:41:59.684 --> 00:42:03.621 region:rollup2
PREMISE OF THE BILL WHICH IS

00:42:01.019 --> 00:42:05.656 region:rollup2
BASICALLY THAT THE GENERAL PLAN.

00:42:03.621 --> 00:42:07.191 region:rollup2
SHOULD FUNCTION AS THE ZONING

00:42:05.656 --> 00:42:08.526 region:rollup2
CODE AND WE THINK THAT

00:42:07.191 --> 00:42:10.461 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY BECAUSE OF THE WAY

00:42:08.526 --> 00:42:12.063 region:rollup2
GENERAL PLANS ARE CONSTRUCTED IN

00:42:10.461 --> 00:42:13.631 region:rollup2
UNINCORPORATED AREAS AND THE

00:42:12.063 --> 00:42:15.900 region:rollup2
FACT THAT THEY ARE INTENDED TO

00:42:13.631 --> 00:42:17.568 region:rollup2
BE A VERY LONG TERM PLAN. THERE

00:42:15.900 --> 00:42:20.671 region:rollup2
IS GOING TO BE A SET OF

00:42:17.568 --> 00:42:23.674 region:rollup2
CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE A PARCEL

00:42:20.671 --> 00:42:25.243 region:rollup2
MAYBE ZONED AT LOW DENSITY AND

00:42:23.674 --> 00:42:27.311 region:rollup2
BE INCLUDED WITHIN A MUCH

00:42:25.243 --> 00:42:29.414 region:rollup2
BROADER RANGE OF DENSITY. IN THE

00:42:27.311 --> 00:42:31.382 region:rollup2
LONG RANGE PLAN FOR THE COUNTY

00:42:29.414 --> 00:42:32.984 region:rollup2
OR FOR THE CITY AND SO FOR THAT

00:42:31.382 --> 00:42:34.485 region:rollup2
REASON WE THINK THAT IT'S MUCH

00:42:32.984 --> 00:42:36.354 region:rollup2
BETTER RATHER THAN FOCUSING IN

00:42:34.485 --> 00:42:37.789 region:rollup2
SAYING. THAT LONG TERM PLAN

00:42:36.354 --> 00:42:39.724 region:rollup2
SHOULD SHOULD SERVE AS THE DE

00:42:37.789 --> 00:42:41.793 region:rollup2
FACTO ZONING CODE IS THAT WHEN

00:42:39.724 --> 00:42:43.361 region:rollup2
WE HAVE SET OUT THE AREAS ON A

00:42:41.793 --> 00:42:45.196 region:rollup2
PARCEL BY PARCEL BASIS IN OUR

00:42:43.361 --> 00:42:46.864 region:rollup2
HOUSING ELEMENTS. AND SAID THIS

00:42:45.196 --> 00:42:48.566 region:rollup2
IS WHERE WE WANT HOUSING GROWTH

00:42:46.864 --> 00:42:50.001 region:rollup2
TO HAPPEN AT THESE DENSITIES

00:42:48.566 --> 00:42:51.869 region:rollup2
THEN THAT'S AN APPROPRIATE

00:42:50.001 --> 00:42:53.871 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY TO USE THAT. GENERAL

00:42:51.869 --> 00:42:55.473 region:rollup2
PLAN LEVEL DENSITY INSTEAD OF

00:42:53.871 --> 00:42:57.341 region:rollup2
WHAT'S IN THE ZONING CODE BUT

00:42:55.473 --> 00:42:59.710 region:rollup2
JUST BECAUSE SOMETHING IS ZONED

00:42:57.341 --> 00:43:01.512 region:rollup2
AT A LOW DENSITY DOESN'T MEAN

00:42:59.710 --> 00:43:03.581 region:rollup2
THAT IT SHOULD YOU KNOW BE TO

00:43:01.512 --> 00:43:05.082 region:rollup2
FACTO UP STONES. AND BECAUSE

00:43:03.581 --> 00:43:06.851 region:rollup2
IT'S IN THE SAME CATEGORY AS A

00:43:05.082 --> 00:43:08.052 region:rollup2
HIGHER DENSITY PARCEL IN THE

00:43:06.851 --> 00:43:08.553 region:rollup2
GENERAL PLAN AND SAW GIVEN

00:43:08.052 --> 00:43:10.188 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE ABOUT WHERE THAT

00:43:08.553 --> 00:43:12.356 region:rollup2
MATTERS.

00:43:10.188 --> 00:43:14.058 region:rollup2
IN THE UNINCORPORATED SOUND SO

00:43:12.356 --> 00:43:16.794 region:rollup2
IN A LOT OF RURAL COUNTIES

00:43:14.058 --> 00:43:18.696 region:rollup2
ZONING IS BASED ON PARCEL SIZES

00:43:16.794 --> 00:43:20.131 region:rollup2
AND SO FOR INSTANCE. I WON

00:43:18.696 --> 00:43:22.200 region:rollup2
COUNTY I WAS TALKING TO ABOUT

00:43:20.131 --> 00:43:23.968 region:rollup2
THIS BILL HAS IS ADEPT LAND USE

00:43:22.200 --> 00:43:26.871 region:rollup2
DESIGNATION THAT RANGES FROM

00:43:23.968 --> 00:43:30.208 region:rollup2
FIVE TO FORTY ACRE ZONING AND SO

00:43:26.871 --> 00:43:31.909 region:rollup2
FOR INSTANCE. UNDER THIS BILL.

00:43:30.208 --> 00:43:33.411 region:rollup2
THAT ZONING FOR WHAT WOULD

00:43:31.909 --> 00:43:34.779 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY BE A FORTY ACRE PARCEL

00:43:33.411 --> 00:43:36.714 region:rollup2
AND ALLOW PERHAPS ONE

00:43:34.779 --> 00:43:39.150 region:rollup2
RESIDENTIAL UNIT WOULD NOW HAVE

00:43:36.714 --> 00:43:41.352 region:rollup2
TO BE APPROVED. BY THE LOCAL

00:43:39.150 --> 00:43:43.754 region:rollup2
AGENCY TO ALLOW EIGHT FIVE ACRE

00:43:41.352 --> 00:43:45.690 region:rollup2
PARCELS AND SO THE ZONING WASN'T

00:43:43.754 --> 00:43:47.358 region:rollup2
SET UP WITH THE INTENT OF

00:43:45.690 --> 00:43:49.227 region:rollup2
ALLOWING HIGHER DENSITY USE ON

00:43:47.358 --> 00:43:51.462 region:rollup2
THOSE LARGER PARCELS IN THE MORE

00:43:49.227 --> 00:43:52.797 region:rollup2
RURAL AREAS AND SO. WE THINK

00:43:51.462 --> 00:43:54.332 region:rollup2
WHAT THIS IS REALLY CREATING IS

00:43:52.797 --> 00:43:56.100 region:rollup2
AN OPPORTUNITY FOR LEAPFROG

00:43:54.332 --> 00:43:57.401 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENT THAT'S INCONSISTENT

00:43:56.100 --> 00:43:58.836 region:rollup2
WITH THE BROADER LAND USE

00:43:57.401 --> 00:44:00.738 region:rollup2
POLICIES OF THE COUNTY OR THE

00:43:58.836 --> 00:44:02.273 region:rollup2
CITY AND SO. FOR THAT REASON WE

00:44:00.738 --> 00:44:04.242 region:rollup2
PROPOSE NARROWING IT AS OUTLINED

00:44:02.273 --> 00:44:05.810 region:rollup2
IN THE ANALYSIS AND LOOK FORWARD

00:44:04.242 --> 00:44:06.878 region:rollup2

WE ALSO AGREE WITH THE COMMENTS

00:44:14.852 --> 00:44:18.990 region:rollup2
OF SEE SEPARATE THIS ISN'T JUST

00:44:16.354 --> 00:44:21.125 region:rollup2
AN URBAN OR RURAL COUNTY ISSUE.

00:44:18.990 --> 00:44:23.995 region:rollup2
THEY HOUSING ELEMENT ITSELF IS

00:44:21.125 --> 00:44:25.129 region:rollup2
REALLY DESIGNED TO SHOW. THE

NOW. SO THEY MAY SAY WE'RE GONNA

00:44:42.113 --> 00:44:45.983 region:rollup2
GO HERE NOW BUT THIS LAYER IS

00:44:44.215 --> 00:44:48.052 region:rollup2
THE NEXT ONE WILL GROWTH WE NEED

00:44:45.983 --> 00:44:49.820 region:rollup2
TO. OF A ONE DO DENSITY FIRST IN

00:44:48.052 --> 00:44:50.922 region:rollup2
THE INFILL. AND THEN THIS IS

THIS IS GONNA BE THIRTY YEARS

00:44:51.989 --> 00:44:56.093 region:rollup2
OUT. WITH THIS BILL BECAUSE YOU

00:44:53.824 --> 00:44:57.562 region:rollup2
WOULD HAVE TO DO A REZONING THEY

00:44:56.093 --> 00:44:59.463 region:rollup2
COULD LEAPFROG TO HEAR.

00:44:57.562 --> 00:45:01.966 region:rollup2
AND EVEN IF IT'S CITY CITY CITY

00:44:59.463 --> 00:45:03.267 region:rollup2
AND THEN ANNEXED PARCELS HERE.

00:45:01.966 --> 00:45:04.502 region:rollup2
WE DON'T WANT TO JUMP AHEAD OF

00:45:03.267 --> 00:45:06.270 region:rollup2
S. B. THREE SEVENTY FIVE AND

00:45:04.502 --> 00:45:08.206 region:rollup2
WHERE ALL THE SERVICES ARE. SOLD

00:45:06.270 --> 00:45:09.607 region:rollup2
FOR US THAT'S A HUGE ISSUE AND

00:45:08.206 --> 00:45:11.175 region:rollup2
WE DON'T MIND CONTINUE WORK WE

00:45:09.607 --> 00:45:12.810 region:rollup2
APPRECIATE THAT BUT WE ALSO WANT

00:45:11.175 --> 00:45:14.478 region:rollup2
TO DO THAT FAIRLY SOON BECAUSE

00:45:12.810 --> 00:45:15.146 region:rollup2
THIS IS CONTINUING WITH THE SAME

00:45:14.478 --> 00:45:16.814 region:rollup2
PROBABLY THAT WITH THE ORIGINAL

00:45:15.146 --> 00:45:17.748 region:rollup2
BELL. ON THE SECOND PIECE THE

00:45:16.814 --> 00:45:19.317 region:rollup2
BILL I JUST WANT TO MENTION

00:45:17.748 --> 00:45:20.518 region:rollup2
QUICKLY WAS INTENT LANGUAGE

00:45:19.317 --> 00:45:22.153 region:rollup2
DEALING WITH A SPECIFIC ADVERSE

00:45:20.518 --> 00:45:24.322 region:rollup2
IMPACTS.

00:45:22.153 --> 00:45:25.656 region:rollup2
THE LANGUAGE IS NOT CLEAR IT

00:45:24.322 --> 00:45:27.592 region:rollup2
HAS DEFINITIONS THAT ARE NOT

00:45:25.656 --> 00:45:30.194 region:rollup2
DEFINED WE DON'T WANNA HAVE TO

00:45:27.592 --> 00:45:31.796 region:rollup2
GO TO COURT TO IDENTIFY HOW WE

00:45:30.194 --> 00:45:33.531 region:rollup2
USE THAT. BECAUSE IT'S INTENT

00:45:31.796 --> 00:45:34.899 region:rollup2
LANGUAGE IT IS NOT STATUTORY

00:45:33.531 --> 00:45:36.867 region:rollup2
LANGUAGE SO WE THINK THE

00:45:34.899 --> 00:45:39.103 region:rollup2
EXISTING ADVERSE IMPACT.

00:45:36.867 --> 00:45:40.538 region:rollup2
LANGUAGE IS VERY DIFFICULT TO

00:45:39.103 --> 00:45:42.473 region:rollup2
USE RIGHT NOW IT'S REALLY DOWN

00:45:40.538 --> 00:45:44.108 region:rollup2
THE FIRE FLOOD AND. ANYTHING

00:45:42.473 --> 00:45:45.443 region:rollup2
ELSE IS A NATURAL DISASTER BUT

00:45:44.108 --> 00:45:47.245 region:rollup2
IF WE NEED IT WE NEED TO BE ABLE

00:45:45.443 --> 00:45:48.946 region:rollup2
TO USE IT SO THAT I THINK YOU

00:45:47.245 --> 00:45:50.848 region:rollup2
THERE HAS TO BE REMOVED OR

00:45:48.946 --> 00:45:52.883 region:rollup2
SUBSTANTIALLY REFINED. BUT WE'RE

00:45:50.848 --> 00:45:54.518 region:rollup2
STILL NOT CLEAR WHY THE EXISTING

00:45:52.883 --> 00:45:56.387 region:rollup2
STATUTE WHICH IS VERY SPECIFIC

00:45:54.518 --> 00:45:58.556 region:rollup2
AND VERY DIFFICULT TO USE IS AN

00:45:56.387 --> 00:45:59.123 region:rollup2
ADEQUATE OF THE BILLS THAT WE

00:45:58.556 --> 00:45:59.924 region:rollup2
OUGHT STILL OPPOSE THE BILL

00:45:59.123 --> 00:46:00.825 region:rollup2
THANK YOU.

TRACY RARE O'CONNOR REPRESENTS A

00:46:04.662 --> 00:46:07.765 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA.

00:46:05.563 --> 00:46:08.366 region:rollup2
ALSO IMPOSE LESS MINUTE FOR THE

00:46:07.765 --> 00:46:11.869 region:rollup2
REASONS STATED THANK YOU THANK

TILLMAN ABORTIVE URBAN CARRIES A

00:46:13.037 --> 00:46:14.939 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA ALSO IMPOSE LESS

00:46:14.505 --> 00:46:17.408 region:rollup2
AMENDED THANK YOU.

00:46:14.939 --> 00:46:19.777 region:rollup2
THANK YOU.

00:46:17.408 --> 00:46:21.078 region:rollup2
ANYONE ELSE OPPOSITION.

00:46:19.777 --> 00:46:23.514 region:rollup2
ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS OF THE

00:46:21.078 --> 00:46:26.384 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE.

00:46:23.514 --> 00:46:27.551 region:rollup2
YES.

00:46:26.384 --> 00:46:29.820 region:rollup2
ASSEMBLYMEMBER WATER WOULD YOU

00:46:27.551 --> 00:46:32.123 region:rollup2
LIKE YOU JUST. JUST TRYING TO

00:46:29.820 --> 00:46:33.824 region:rollup2
CLARIFY OIL THOUGH SO.

00:46:32.123 --> 00:46:35.893 region:rollup2
I FIGURE I CAN GO OFF MY

00:46:33.824 --> 00:46:36.160 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCE AS A LOCAL ELECTED

00:46:35.893 --> 00:46:37.695 region:rollup2
OFFICIAL.

00:46:36.160 --> 00:46:38.929 region:rollup2
.

00:46:37.695 --> 00:46:42.033 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THE WAY THEY ARE CITY

00:46:38.929 --> 00:46:43.968 region:rollup2
WAS DESIGNED IN TWO YEARS.

00:46:42.033 --> 00:46:45.369 region:rollup2
SO THAT AS IT WENT OUT. WAS MORE

00:46:43.968 --> 00:46:47.438 region:rollup2
RURAL.

00:46:45.369 --> 00:46:49.473 region:rollup2
SUBURBAN AND URBAN URBAN CORE.

00:46:47.438 --> 00:46:52.777 region:rollup2
.

00:46:49.473 --> 00:46:54.779 region:rollup2
SO BASICALLY THIS WOULD ALLOW.

00:46:52.777 --> 00:46:56.480 region:rollup2
HIGH DENSITY TO.

00:46:54.779 --> 00:46:58.215 region:rollup2
EVEN IF THE NEXT PARCEL OVER WAS

00:46:56.480 --> 00:46:59.350 region:rollup2
NOT ZONED AT THE SAME DENSITY IS

00:46:58.215 --> 00:47:00.418 region:rollup2
THIS ONE.

00:46:59.350 --> 00:47:02.987 region:rollup2
IT COULD ACTUALLY GO OUT INTO

00:47:00.418 --> 00:47:04.288 region:rollup2
THAT AREA.

00:47:02.987 --> 00:47:06.157 region:rollup2
AND BE THE SAME ZONING IS THE

00:47:04.288 --> 00:47:07.458 region:rollup2
ONE ADJACENT.

00:47:06.157 --> 00:47:09.727 region:rollup2
I THINK IT WOULD DEPEND ON THE

00:47:07.458 --> 00:47:11.462 region:rollup2
LANGUAGE IN THE GENERAL PLAN.

00:47:09.727 --> 00:47:13.431 region:rollup2
AND THE HOUSING ELEMENT.

00:47:11.462 --> 00:47:15.433 region:rollup2
IN THAT CITY.

00:47:13.431 --> 00:47:17.635 region:rollup2
THE OTHER LOT OF OTHER FACTORS

00:47:15.433 --> 00:47:18.903 region:rollup2
ARM I DON'T WANNA SAY THAT THAT

00:47:17.635 --> 00:47:19.103 region:rollup2
COULD NOT HAPPEN ABSOLUTELY BUT

00:47:18.903 --> 00:47:20.271 region:rollup2
IT IS

00:47:19.103 --> 00:47:21.806 region:rollup2
IT.

00:47:20.271 --> 00:47:24.508 region:rollup2
SHOULD NOT HAPPEN.

00:47:21.806 --> 00:47:25.109 region:rollup2
IT SHOULD NOT HAPPEN.

00:47:24.508 --> 00:47:27.311 region:rollup2
AN I WANT TO JUST COMMENT ON

00:47:25.109 --> 00:47:29.513 region:rollup2
THEM. ON ON WHAT WAS SAID.

00:47:27.311 --> 00:47:31.148 region:rollup2
BY WILL ABSOLUTELY CONTINUE TO

00:47:29.513 --> 00:47:32.850 region:rollup2
WORK WITH.

00:47:31.148 --> 00:47:34.819 region:rollup2
THOSE WHO HAVE CONCERNS WITH THE

00:47:32.850 --> 00:47:36.287 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE DEFINITIONS.

00:47:34.819 --> 00:47:37.655 region:rollup2
AND THE VERY POINT THAT YOU'RE

00:47:36.287 --> 00:47:39.190 region:rollup2
RAISING WHICH IS THE.

00:47:37.655 --> 00:47:41.826 region:rollup2
THE.

00:47:39.190 --> 00:47:43.561 region:rollup2
.

00:47:41.826 --> 00:47:45.763 region:rollup2
WHAT THEY SAY IS THE POSSIBILITY

00:47:43.561 --> 00:47:47.064 region:rollup2
OF LEAP FROG THE DEVELOPMENT?

00:47:45.763 --> 00:47:49.033 region:rollup2
I THINK IT DEPENDS ON THE

00:47:47.064 --> 00:47:50.468 region:rollup2
DEFINITIONS AND IT DEPENDS ON

00:47:49.033 --> 00:47:51.969 region:rollup2
THE GENERAL PLAN AND THE HOUSING

00:47:50.468 --> 00:47:52.837 region:rollup2
ELEMENT SO THEY ALL THEY ALL ARE

00:47:51.969 --> 00:47:54.839 region:rollup2
SUPPOSED TO WORK.

00:47:52.837 --> 00:47:57.007 region:rollup2
BOB.

00:47:54.839 --> 00:47:58.776 region:rollup2
IN A COMPLEMENTARY FASHION.

00:47:57.007 --> 00:48:00.544 region:rollup2
IF THEY DON'T.

00:47:58.776 --> 00:48:02.279 region:rollup2
A JURISDICTION IN MY OPINION THE

00:48:00.544 --> 00:48:04.248 region:rollup2
JURISDICTION MAYBE HAS TO

00:48:02.279 --> 00:48:06.217 region:rollup2
REVISIT ITS OWN DOCUMENTS.

00:48:04.248 --> 00:48:08.018 region:rollup2
BUT THIS IS WHY WE HAVE I

00:48:06.217 --> 00:48:09.453 region:rollup2
HOUSING CRISIS IS BECAUSE A LOT

00:48:08.018 --> 00:48:11.222 region:rollup2
OF JURISDICTIONS THESE. THESE

00:48:09.453 --> 00:48:14.358 region:rollup2
PLANS

00:48:11.222 --> 00:48:15.926 region:rollup2
DON'T ARE NOT COMPLEMENTARY.

00:48:14.358 --> 00:48:17.661 region:rollup2
AND WE WE WANT THEM TO BE

00:48:15.926 --> 00:48:20.131 region:rollup2
COMPLIMENTARY.

00:48:17.661 --> 00:48:23.634 region:rollup2
AND SO ANYTHING WE CAN DO TO TO.

00:48:20.131 --> 00:48:25.336 region:rollup2
.

00:48:23.634 --> 00:48:26.303 region:rollup2
TO PASS LAWS THAT THAT

00:48:25.336 --> 00:48:27.104 region:rollup2
ENCOURAGED THAT I THINK IS A

00:48:26.303 --> 00:48:28.739 region:rollup2
GOOD IDEA.

00:48:27.104 --> 00:48:31.175 region:rollup2
SO.

00:48:28.739 --> 00:48:32.209 region:rollup2
YEAH NAM.

00:48:31.175 --> 00:48:34.345 region:rollup2
THE COURSE LEAPFROG DEVELOPMENT.

00:48:32.209 --> 00:48:36.147 region:rollup2
.

00:48:34.345 --> 00:48:37.581 region:rollup2
IS A PRETTY BROAD PHRASE TO ME

00:48:36.147 --> 00:48:39.283 region:rollup2
HOW MANY UNITS ARE WE TALKING

00:48:37.581 --> 00:48:40.851 region:rollup2
ABOUT ULTIMATELY.

00:48:39.283 --> 00:48:42.686 region:rollup2
ME WE NEED A LOT MORE UNITS IN

00:48:40.851 --> 00:48:44.355 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA AND THIS IS WHY WE

00:48:42.686 --> 00:48:45.890 region:rollup2
DON'T ALWAYS GET THEM.

00:48:44.355 --> 00:48:48.592 region:rollup2
BECAUSE JURISDICTIONS DON'T HAVE

00:48:45.890 --> 00:48:49.393 region:rollup2
A LOT OF INCENTIVES TO GET THEIR

00:48:48.592 --> 00:48:50.995 region:rollup2
PLANNING ACTS.

00:48:49.393 --> 00:48:52.897 region:rollup2
ORGANIZED IT IS EXPENSIVE FOR

00:48:50.995 --> 00:48:53.798 region:rollup2
INSTANCE FOR GENERAL OF YOU KNOW

00:48:52.897 --> 00:48:54.632 region:rollup2
TO UPDATE A GENERAL PLAN OR

00:48:53.798 --> 00:48:56.200 region:rollup2
UPDATE HOUSING ELEMENT

00:48:54.632 --> 00:48:58.302 region:rollup2
COSTS MONEY.

00:48:56.200 --> 00:48:59.904 region:rollup2
AND.

00:48:58.302 --> 00:49:00.871 region:rollup2
SOME LOCAL JURISDICTIONS KEEP

00:48:59.904 --> 00:49:02.373 region:rollup2
KICKING THE CAN DOWN THE ROAD

00:49:00.871 --> 00:49:04.842 region:rollup2
BECAUSE.

00:49:02.373 --> 00:49:06.443 region:rollup2
DAY.

00:49:04.842 --> 00:49:07.845 region:rollup2
I DON'T SEE IT AS A PRIORITY. TO

00:49:06.443 --> 00:49:09.346 region:rollup2
HAVE THEIR HAVE THEIR.

00:49:07.845 --> 00:49:10.915 region:rollup2
THEIR GENERAL PLAN HOUSING

00:49:09.346 --> 00:49:12.383 region:rollup2
ELEMENT LAND USE ELEMENT

00:49:10.915 --> 00:49:15.352 region:rollup2
TRANSPORTATION ELEMENT AND SO

00:49:12.383 --> 00:49:16.921 region:rollup2
FORTH ALL IN SYNC.

00:49:15.352 --> 00:49:19.490 region:rollup2
THAT'S A LONG WINDED ANSWER A

00:49:16.921 --> 00:49:21.525 region:rollup2
MISS WALDRON BUT SOME.

00:49:19.490 --> 00:49:22.726 region:rollup2
I WANT THIS.

00:49:21.525 --> 00:49:24.128 region:rollup2
BILL TO IMPROVE THE PLANNING

00:49:22.726 --> 00:49:26.397 region:rollup2
PROCESS.

00:49:24.128 --> 00:49:27.898 region:rollup2
NOT.

00:49:26.397 --> 00:49:29.867 region:rollup2
OPEN THE DOOR TO BAD PLANNING

00:49:27.898 --> 00:49:31.735 region:rollup2
MINE.

00:49:29.867 --> 00:49:34.238 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE ISSUES WE HAD WITH

00:49:31.735 --> 00:49:35.606 region:rollup2
OUR TEARS WAS THAT. WE ONLY

00:49:34.238 --> 00:49:37.341 region:rollup2
WOULD YOU KNOW LOOK TO.

00:49:35.606 --> 00:49:39.076 region:rollup2
BUILD AT

00:49:37.341 --> 00:49:39.910 region:rollup2
THE DENSITY IN THE GENERAL PLAN

00:49:39.076 --> 00:49:41.879 region:rollup2
WHEN THE INFRASTRUCTURE WAS

00:49:39.910 --> 00:49:44.882 region:rollup2
AVAILABLE.

00:49:41.879 --> 00:49:45.916 region:rollup2
WHICH WAS OUR. GOAL OF NOT.

00:49:44.882 --> 00:49:47.985 region:rollup2
NINA PREVENTING THE LEAPFROG.

00:49:45.916 --> 00:49:49.787 region:rollup2
.

00:49:47.985 --> 00:49:51.589 region:rollup2
SO IF YOU HAVE ZONING AND

00:49:49.787 --> 00:49:53.691 region:rollup2
ADJACENT AREAS ORINDA DIFFERENCE

00:49:51.589 --> 00:49:54.859 region:rollup2
OWN LEVEL.

00:49:53.691 --> 00:49:56.060 region:rollup2
BUT THE INFRASTRUCTURE IS NOT

00:49:54.859 --> 00:49:57.528 region:rollup2
THERE AND IT'S NOT JUST SEWER

00:49:56.060 --> 00:49:59.096 region:rollup2
AND WATER COULD BE POLICE FIRE

00:49:57.528 --> 00:50:00.297 region:rollup2
SERVICE AND ALL THOSE THINGS

00:49:59.096 --> 00:50:01.632 region:rollup2
THOSE ARE AN ISSUE. THAT THE

00:50:00.297 --> 00:50:02.566 region:rollup2
CITY.

00:50:01.632 --> 00:50:05.102 region:rollup2
HAS TO LOOK AT WHEN IT'S

00:50:02.566 --> 00:50:06.904 region:rollup2
PLANNING.

00:50:05.102 --> 00:50:08.606 region:rollup2
SO THAT'S YOU KNOW. JUST WHAT

00:50:06.904 --> 00:50:10.474 region:rollup2
THE OPPONENT OPPONENTS WAS

00:50:08.606 --> 00:50:12.776 region:rollup2
SAYING KIND OF RAISE THAT

00:50:10.474 --> 00:50:14.845 region:rollup2
CONCERN TO ME THAT.

00:50:12.776 --> 00:50:16.647 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW IF THIS IS GOING TO.

00:50:14.845 --> 00:50:17.815 region:rollup2
RESULT IN OF GENERAL PLANS

00:50:16.647 --> 00:50:20.084 region:rollup2
ALLOWING HIGH DENSITY

00:50:17.815 --> 00:50:20.684 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENT INTO AREAS THAT

00:50:20.084 --> 00:50:22.152 region:rollup2
DON'T HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE

00:50:20.684 --> 00:50:23.087 region:rollup2
AREA.

00:50:22.152 --> 00:50:25.589 region:rollup2
WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN WITH THE

00:50:23.087 --> 00:50:27.458 region:rollup2
PROJECT HAVE TO SIT AND WAIT.

00:50:25.589 --> 00:50:30.427 region:rollup2
UNTIL THAT'S AVAILABLE OUR HOUSE

00:50:27.458 --> 00:50:30.995 region:rollup2
AND YOU KNOW.

00:50:30.427 --> 00:50:33.330 region:rollup2
I THINK PART OF THE PROBLEM

00:50:30.995 --> 00:50:35.366 region:rollup2
WHERE. MY CITY IN JUST COULD

00:50:33.330 --> 00:50:37.535 region:rollup2
COME OFF MY EXPERIENCE BEING AN

00:50:35.366 --> 00:50:39.870 region:rollup2
OLDER CITY AT. PRETTY MUCH BILLS

00:50:37.535 --> 00:50:41.071 region:rollup2
OUT BUT YET IN THESE HOUSING

00:50:39.870 --> 00:50:42.640 region:rollup2
ELEMENTS IN THESE YOU KNOW ALL

00:50:41.071 --> 00:50:44.375 region:rollup2
OF THE REGIONAL PLANNING

00:50:42.640 --> 00:50:46.343 region:rollup2
AGENCIES ALWAYS TRYING TO PUT

00:50:44.375 --> 00:50:47.511 region:rollup2
MORE HOUSING IN. THEN YOU COULD

00:50:46.343 --> 00:50:48.812 region:rollup2
REALLY FIT AND.

00:50:47.511 --> 00:50:51.015 region:rollup2
THESE OLDER CITIES WANT TO DO

00:50:48.812 --> 00:50:52.750 region:rollup2
INFILL THEY DON'T WANNA GO OUT

00:50:51.015 --> 00:50:54.485 region:rollup2
INTO THESE OTHER AREAS SO.

00:50:52.750 --> 00:50:56.720 region:rollup2
IT'S KIND OF A BALANCING ACT

00:50:54.485 --> 00:50:59.156 region:rollup2
I PROMISE YOU I WILL BE WORKING

00:50:56.720 --> 00:51:01.792 region:rollup2
WITH THE OPPONENTS TO.

00:50:59.156 --> 00:51:05.195 region:rollup2
TO RESOLVE THAT ISSUE.

00:51:01.792 --> 00:51:06.897 region:rollup2
AND THE ALL STAY IN TOUCH WITH

00:51:05.195 --> 00:51:09.533 region:rollup2
THIS COMMITTEE TO. BUT BUT TO DO

00:51:06.897 --> 00:51:11.502 region:rollup2
THAT.

00:51:09.533 --> 00:51:13.704 region:rollup2
I'M I DON'T THINK I MEAN I.

00:51:11.502 --> 00:51:16.974 region:rollup2
YEAH THESE ARE THORNY ISSUES.

00:51:13.704 --> 00:51:20.077 region:rollup2
BUT IF WE DON'T. PUSH FORWARD.

00:51:16.974 --> 00:51:23.414 region:rollup2
I MEAN I I FEEL TO.

00:51:20.077 --> 00:51:25.549 region:rollup2
THE ME TO USE PLANNING.

00:51:23.414 --> 00:51:27.985 region:rollup2
AS AN EXCUSE.

00:51:25.549 --> 00:51:29.787 region:rollup2
TO NOT ALLOW HOUSING.

00:51:27.985 --> 00:51:31.488 region:rollup2
IS A PROBLEM ALSO.

00:51:29.787 --> 00:51:33.457 region:rollup2
SO WE'VE GOT A FIND A SWEET SPOT

00:51:31.488 --> 00:51:34.725 region:rollup2
WHERE WE ENCOURAGE MORE PLANNING

00:51:33.457 --> 00:51:36.226 region:rollup2
AND PLANS TO BE UP TO DATE OF

00:51:34.725 --> 00:51:38.395 region:rollup2
GENERAL PLANS.

00:51:36.226 --> 00:51:38.862 region:rollup2
R. ARE TOO FAR ADDED DATE THEY

00:51:38.395 --> 00:51:40.898 region:rollup2
ARE LONG TERM PLANNING

00:51:38.862 --> 00:51:43.133 region:rollup2
DOCUMENTS.

00:51:40.898 --> 00:51:45.135 region:rollup2
BUT WE NEED THEM TO REFLECT

00:51:43.133 --> 00:51:47.604 region:rollup2
TODAY'S REALITIES AS WELL.

00:51:45.135 --> 00:51:48.672 region:rollup2
SO THAT'S.

00:51:47.604 --> 00:51:50.608 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THE USER THESE ARE VERY

00:51:48.672 --> 00:51:51.976 region:rollup2
COMPLICATED CONCEPTS BUT IN

00:51:50.608 --> 00:51:54.845 region:rollup2
PRACTICE AND I THINK MAYBE WE

00:51:51.976 --> 00:51:56.847 region:rollup2
NEED TO. HAVE SOME EXAMPLES FROM

00:51:54.845 --> 00:51:58.582 region:rollup2
SOME SPECIFIC EXAMPLES.

00:51:56.847 --> 00:52:00.384 region:rollup2
IF THERE ARE COUNTIES

00:51:58.582 --> 00:52:01.852 region:rollup2
THAT DON'T WANT DENSITIES IN

00:52:00.384 --> 00:52:03.120 region:rollup2
CERTAIN PARTS OF THEIR COUNTIES

00:52:01.852 --> 00:52:04.555 region:rollup2
SAY THAT JUST SAY IT LOUD AND

00:52:03.120 --> 00:52:06.724 region:rollup2
CLEAR.

00:52:04.555 --> 00:52:08.359 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW YEAH.

00:52:06.724 --> 00:52:10.194 region:rollup2
I KNOW BECAUSE ARE THE CITY I

00:52:08.359 --> 00:52:11.996 region:rollup2
WASN'T RECENTLY UPDATED ITS

00:52:10.194 --> 00:52:13.764 region:rollup2
GENERAL PLAN AND IT WAS

00:52:11.996 --> 00:52:15.099 region:rollup2
LITERALLY A TEN YEAR PROCESS WHO

00:52:13.764 --> 00:52:17.668 region:rollup2
THEN BOWIE OTHER TALENTS NO IT'S

00:52:15.099 --> 00:52:18.102 region:rollup2
ARDUOUS IT'S. IT'S HARD IT'S IN

00:52:17.668 --> 00:52:19.870 region:rollup2
HOUSING ELEMENTS ARE

00:52:18.102 --> 00:52:22.139 region:rollup2
NOTORIOUSLY.

00:52:19.870 --> 00:52:23.807 region:rollup2
CHALLENGING.

00:52:22.139 --> 00:52:25.943 region:rollup2
AND IN THE STATE HAS A ROLE IN

00:52:23.807 --> 00:52:28.912 region:rollup2
HOUSING ELEMENTS TO.

00:52:25.943 --> 00:52:30.714 region:rollup2
AND ON AND ON BUT I BOMB I WAS

00:52:28.912 --> 00:52:32.716 region:rollup2
IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT FOR A

00:52:30.714 --> 00:52:33.417 region:rollup2
FOURTEEN YEARS NAM.

00:52:32.716 --> 00:52:35.519 region:rollup2
AND.

00:52:33.417 --> 00:52:37.521 region:rollup2
I A.

00:52:35.519 --> 00:52:39.456 region:rollup2
CAREA LOT ABOUT GOOD PLANNING

00:52:37.521 --> 00:52:42.126 region:rollup2
RATIONAL PLANNING SO PEOPLE HAVE

00:52:39.456 --> 00:52:43.894 region:rollup2
PREDICTABILITY INFRASTRUCTURE.

00:52:42.126 --> 00:52:46.063 region:rollup2
MUST BE AVAILABLE.

00:52:43.894 --> 00:52:48.198 region:rollup2
SO WE'LL DO OUR BEST TO.

00:52:46.063 --> 00:52:50.267 region:rollup2
AT DEEPER CONVERSATIONS WITH

00:52:48.198 --> 00:52:51.935 region:rollup2
THESE FOLKS ARE.

00:52:50.267 --> 00:52:52.803 region:rollup2
WITH THE PLANNING ASSOCIATION

00:52:51.935 --> 00:52:56.273 region:rollup2
AND.

00:52:52.803 --> 00:53:01.045 region:rollup2
THE CAT WITH D. AND C. SACK.

00:52:56.273 --> 00:53:03.113 region:rollup2
AND. I TRY TO FIND A SWEET SPOT.

00:53:01.045 --> 00:53:04.248 region:rollup2
SOME RECORD.

00:53:03.113 --> 00:53:05.649 region:rollup2
DEPECHE PERFECT WHEN IT ANY

00:53:04.248 --> 00:53:07.351 region:rollup2
OTHER QUESTIONS YES

00:53:05.649 --> 00:53:08.986 region:rollup2
ASSEMBLYMEMBER COOLEY BUDGETS

00:53:07.351 --> 00:53:10.788 region:rollup2
WAS SAY I.

00:53:08.986 --> 00:53:11.655 region:rollup2
I WILL SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY

00:53:10.788 --> 00:53:13.657 region:rollup2
TOM BUT I DO THINK THIS IS A

00:53:11.655 --> 00:53:15.359 region:rollup2
VERY. VERY IMPORTANT CONSCIOUS

00:53:13.657 --> 00:53:16.894 region:rollup2
HAVE VERY COMPLICATED ONE.

00:53:15.359 --> 00:53:18.629 region:rollup2
WE HAVE ZONING WE HAVE THE

00:53:16.894 --> 00:53:18.896 region:rollup2
GENERAL PLANNED LAW.

00:53:18.629 --> 00:53:20.631 region:rollup2
WE ADDED.

00:53:18.896 --> 00:53:22.332 region:rollup2
.

00:53:20.631 --> 00:53:23.233 region:rollup2
AS WAS ALLUDED TO SP THREE

00:53:22.332 --> 00:53:24.968 region:rollup2
SEVENTY FIVE SUSTAINABLE

00:53:23.233 --> 00:53:26.303 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES.

00:53:24.968 --> 00:53:27.938 region:rollup2
WHICH SUPPORTS MORE COMPACT

00:53:26.303 --> 00:53:28.472 region:rollup2
DEVELOPED LET'S A JOURNAL PART

00:53:27.938 --> 00:53:30.140 region:rollup2
OF OUR RESPONSE TO GLOBAL

00:53:28.472 --> 00:53:31.875 region:rollup2
WARMING.

00:53:30.140 --> 00:53:33.177 region:rollup2
THAT'S A NEW OVERLAY.

00:53:31.875 --> 00:53:34.511 region:rollup2
THAT HAS KIND OF FORCED

00:53:33.177 --> 00:53:35.679 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES TO KIND OF A LINE

00:53:34.511 --> 00:53:36.914 region:rollup2
THERE GENERAL PLANS WITH THE

00:53:35.679 --> 00:53:38.382 region:rollup2
SUSTAINABLE.

00:53:36.914 --> 00:53:40.350 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY SO THERE HAVE BEEN

00:53:38.382 --> 00:53:42.419 region:rollup2
SOME PRESSURES ALREADY.

00:53:40.350 --> 00:53:43.220 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT JUST YOU GOT THE ZONING

00:53:42.419 --> 00:53:45.289 region:rollup2
AND THE GENERAL PLAN AT THE

00:53:43.220 --> 00:53:46.256 region:rollup2
COUNTY LEVEL BUT YOU YOU DO HAVE

00:53:45.289 --> 00:53:48.225 region:rollup2
SOME STATE POLICY THAT'S.

00:53:46.256 --> 00:53:49.460 region:rollup2
MOVE DAN.

00:53:48.225 --> 00:53:51.729 region:rollup2
AND SO SOME OF THESE PIECES

00:53:49.460 --> 00:53:53.197 region:rollup2
START ALIGNING.

00:53:51.729 --> 00:53:54.565 region:rollup2
AND SO THIS ISSUE OF LEAPFROG

00:53:53.197 --> 00:53:56.166 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENT ACTUALLY DOES TIE

00:53:54.565 --> 00:53:57.534 region:rollup2
INTO S. B. THROUGH SEVENTY FIVE

00:53:56.166 --> 00:53:58.969 region:rollup2
AND HOW ALL THE PIECES FIT

00:53:57.534 --> 00:54:00.504 region:rollup2
TOGETHER.

00:53:58.969 --> 00:54:01.038 region:rollup2
IT'S ACTUALLY VERY COMPLICATED

00:54:00.504 --> 00:54:02.239 region:rollup2
FIELD HEARINGS CHECK ON A

00:54:01.038 --> 00:54:04.675 region:rollup2
COUNTY.

00:54:02.239 --> 00:54:06.477 region:rollup2
IF YOU HOP IN A CAR. AT

00:54:04.675 --> 00:54:08.378 region:rollup2
THE EAST MOST NEIGHBORHOOD IN

00:54:06.477 --> 00:54:09.346 region:rollup2
RANCHO CORDOVA.

00:54:08.378 --> 00:54:11.215 region:rollup2
AND DR TO THE URBAN SERVICES

00:54:09.346 --> 00:54:12.583 region:rollup2
BOUNDARY.

00:54:11.215 --> 00:54:15.419 region:rollup2
IN MY DISTRICT IT'S ABOUT A

00:54:12.583 --> 00:54:16.954 region:rollup2
TWENTY FIVE MINUTE DRIVE EAST.

00:54:15.419 --> 00:54:18.622 region:rollup2
AND THERE IS PEOPLE WHO BOUGHT A

00:54:16.954 --> 00:54:19.523 region:rollup2
LOT OF THIS. ACREAGE UP BY THE

00:54:18.622 --> 00:54:21.792 region:rollup2
TENS OF THOUSANDS IN THE

00:54:19.523 --> 00:54:22.926 region:rollup2
EIGHTIES.

00:54:21.792 --> 00:54:24.294 region:rollup2
AND SOME OF THESE FOLKS Y.

00:54:22.926 --> 00:54:26.263 region:rollup2
BOUGHT THIS LAND ANTICIPATING

00:54:24.294 --> 00:54:27.564 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENT.

00:54:26.263 --> 00:54:29.700 region:rollup2
AND THEN THINGS HAVE CHANGED IN

00:54:27.564 --> 00:54:32.102 region:rollup2
THE INNER MEANING TIMES.

00:54:29.700 --> 00:54:34.037 region:rollup2
SO YOU COULD HAVE SOME FOLKS WHO

00:54:32.102 --> 00:54:34.605 region:rollup2
HAVE THIS PROPERTY WOULD LIKE TO

00:54:34.037 --> 00:54:35.639 region:rollup2
GET IN DEVELOPMENTS SOON AS

00:54:34.605 --> 00:54:38.075 region:rollup2
POSSIBLE.

00:54:35.639 --> 00:54:38.942 region:rollup2
BECAUSE TIME IS

00:54:38.075 --> 00:54:40.711 region:rollup2
ON THEIR MONEY IS WASTED.

00:54:38.942 --> 00:54:42.880 region:rollup2
SO I'D.

00:54:40.711 --> 00:54:45.015 region:rollup2
I THINK THE FOCUS OF THE BILL ON

00:54:42.880 --> 00:54:46.750 region:rollup2
ZONING IN THE GENERAL PLAN IS A

00:54:45.015 --> 00:54:48.352 region:rollup2
GOOD THING THE CHICK WE GOTTA

00:54:46.750 --> 00:54:50.020 region:rollup2
KEEP IN MIND THAT THEY ACTUALLY

00:54:48.352 --> 00:54:51.321 region:rollup2
THE STATUS ENUNCIATED ITS OWN.

00:54:50.020 --> 00:54:53.190 region:rollup2
LAYER POLICY.

00:54:51.321 --> 00:54:55.092 region:rollup2
THE SUPPORT FOR THIS.

00:54:53.190 --> 00:54:56.794 region:rollup2
FAVORING COMPACT ENVELOPMENT IN

00:54:55.092 --> 00:54:58.796 region:rollup2
AVOIDING LEAPFROG DEVELOPMENT.

00:54:56.794 --> 00:55:00.731 region:rollup2
SO I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF. A

00:54:58.796 --> 00:55:00.898 region:rollup2
LOT OF POLICY THAT'S OUT HERE.

00:55:00.731 --> 00:55:02.499 region:rollup2
AND.

00:55:00.898 --> 00:55:04.201 region:rollup2
.

00:55:02.499 --> 00:55:05.202 region:rollup2
WE GOTTA KINDA NOT JUST FOCUS ON

00:55:04.201 --> 00:55:06.737 region:rollup2
THE LOCAL STUFF BUT HOW IT FEELS

00:55:05.202 --> 00:55:10.741 region:rollup2
TO THE STATE.

00:55:06.737 --> 00:55:12.376 region:rollup2
RELEVANT STATUTE.

00:55:10.741 --> 00:55:14.011 region:rollup2
THE CONCERNS OF THE OPPOSITION I

00:55:12.376 --> 00:55:16.146 region:rollup2
TAKE VERY VERY SERIOUSLY AND I

00:55:14.011 --> 00:55:16.814 region:rollup2
WANT TO RESOLVE THEM.

00:55:16.146 --> 00:55:18.615 region:rollup2
AND.

00:55:16.814 --> 00:55:20.150 region:rollup2
I THINK IT'S WORTH.

00:55:18.615 --> 00:55:21.652 region:rollup2
THIS IS A A CHALLENGE WORTH

00:55:20.150 --> 00:55:22.152 region:rollup2
PURSUING.

00:55:21.652 --> 00:55:23.587 region:rollup2
AND.

00:55:22.152 --> 00:55:26.657 region:rollup2
MAMA DO MY BEST TO FIND THE

00:55:23.587 --> 00:55:27.758 region:rollup2
SWEET SPOT.

00:55:26.657 --> 00:55:29.393 region:rollup2
ANY OTHER QUESTIONS YES IS A

00:55:27.758 --> 00:55:30.260 region:rollup2
SOLANO HERRERA.

00:55:29.393 --> 00:55:32.196 region:rollup2
I ACTUALLY.

00:55:30.260 --> 00:55:33.831 region:rollup2
DON'T HAVE A QUESTION OTHER

00:55:32.196 --> 00:55:34.131 region:rollup2
THAN THAT AND THEN I HAVE A

00:55:33.831 --> 00:55:35.532 region:rollup2
COMMENT IS.

00:55:34.131 --> 00:55:36.500 region:rollup2
.

00:55:35.532 --> 00:55:38.135 region:rollup2
REALLY APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE

00:55:36.500 --> 00:55:39.436 region:rollup2
TRYING TO DO HERE I THINK THAT

00:55:38.135 --> 00:55:42.206 region:rollup2
THE CHALLENGES.

00:55:39.436 --> 00:55:43.507 region:rollup2
THAT.

00:55:42.206 --> 00:55:45.175 region:rollup2
WOULD YOU KNOW WHAT WORKS BETTER

00:55:43.507 --> 00:55:45.809 region:rollup2
THE CARRIER THE STICK.

00:55:45.175 --> 00:55:48.979 region:rollup2
AND.

00:55:45.809 --> 00:55:50.614 region:rollup2
WE ALWAYS END UP COMING HERE IN.

00:55:48.979 --> 00:55:51.215 region:rollup2
PASSING LEGISLATION BECAUSE

00:55:50.614 --> 00:55:52.549 region:rollup2
THERE'S ABOUT ACTOR OUT THERE

00:55:51.215 --> 00:55:54.151 region:rollup2
THAT.

00:55:52.549 --> 00:55:55.652 region:rollup2
OR MAYBE UP A LOT ABOUT ACTORS

00:55:54.151 --> 00:55:56.753 region:rollup2
RIGHT THERE'S A LOTTA NIMBIS OUT

00:55:55.652 --> 00:55:58.155 region:rollup2
THERE THAT JUST THEY REALLY

00:55:56.753 --> 00:55:59.456 region:rollup2
DELVE TELL YOU I'M FOR

00:55:58.155 --> 00:56:00.557 region:rollup2
AFFORDABLE HOUSING I WANT

00:55:59.456 --> 00:56:02.326 region:rollup2
HOUSING AND THEN THE MINUTE YOU

00:56:00.557 --> 00:56:03.861 region:rollup2
START PROPOSING IT. THERE'S NOT

00:56:02.326 --> 00:56:05.729 region:rollup2
A GOODS GOOD PLACE FOR IT AND

00:56:03.861 --> 00:56:07.297 region:rollup2
THAT'S REALLY WHAT THIS WHOLE

00:56:05.729 --> 00:56:08.599 region:rollup2
AREA IS SET UP TO DO.

00:56:07.297 --> 00:56:09.900 region:rollup2
AND THEN AT SOME POINT.

00:56:08.599 --> 00:56:12.002 region:rollup2
I'M GONNA SUPPORT YOUR BILL

00:56:09.900 --> 00:56:13.637 region:rollup2
TODAY I THINK EVEN IF THEY'RE

00:56:12.002 --> 00:56:15.539 region:rollup2
SOME WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE.

00:56:13.637 --> 00:56:17.941 region:rollup2
I THINK IT'S.

00:56:15.539 --> 00:56:18.508 region:rollup2
THERE I CAN THINK OF LANGUAGE

00:56:17.941 --> 00:56:20.244 region:rollup2
THAT WORKS TO DEAL WITH THAT

00:56:18.508 --> 00:56:22.179 region:rollup2
THIS.

00:56:20.244 --> 00:56:25.115 region:rollup2
THE IS NOT TO BE USED AS A TO

00:56:22.179 --> 00:56:27.651 region:rollup2
LEAPFROG VACANT PARCELS ALONG

00:56:25.115 --> 00:56:29.453 region:rollup2
THE WAY. ON.

00:56:27.651 --> 00:56:31.088 region:rollup2
BUT BUT AT SOME POINT I THINK WE

00:56:29.453 --> 00:56:33.824 region:rollup2
NEED TO GET TO A POINT WHERE WE

00:56:31.088 --> 00:56:35.959 region:rollup2
SAY YOU HAVE TO HAVE A.

00:56:33.824 --> 00:56:37.327 region:rollup2
HOUSING ELEMENT THAT'S CURRENT

00:56:35.959 --> 00:56:38.762 region:rollup2
AND APPROVED YOU HAVE TO HAVE A

00:56:37.327 --> 00:56:40.130 region:rollup2
GENERAL PLAN IT'S AT LEAST WITH

00:56:38.762 --> 00:56:41.498 region:rollup2
THE NEXT NUMBER OF YEARS SO

00:56:40.130 --> 00:56:43.300 region:rollup2
THEY'VE LOOKED AT IT RECENTLY

00:56:41.498 --> 00:56:44.868 region:rollup2
AND. AND THEN WORK ON IT.

00:56:43.300 --> 00:56:46.603 region:rollup2
YOU HAVE TO HAVE YOUR ZONING

00:56:44.868 --> 00:56:48.672 region:rollup2
ORDINANCE OF UP TO.

00:56:46.603 --> 00:56:49.640 region:rollup2
TWO IT THAT CONSISTENT WITH YOUR

00:56:48.672 --> 00:56:50.374 region:rollup2
GENERAL PLANNING YOUR HOUSING

00:56:49.640 --> 00:56:51.575 region:rollup2
ELEMENT.

00:56:50.374 --> 00:56:52.910 region:rollup2
AND IF YOU DO ALL OF THAT YOUR

00:56:51.575 --> 00:56:54.211 region:rollup2
FIRST IN LINE FOR STATE MONEY

00:56:52.910 --> 00:56:55.812 region:rollup2
AND IF YOU DON'T IF YOU'RE NOT

00:56:54.211 --> 00:56:56.813 region:rollup2
DOING ANY OF THOSE IF YOU IF IF

00:56:55.812 --> 00:56:58.649 region:rollup2
THERE'S ANY OF THOSE ARE

00:56:56.813 --> 00:57:00.550 region:rollup2
DEFICIENT YOU KNOW GETS.

00:56:58.649 --> 00:57:01.952 region:rollup2
RESOURCES TO BUILD.

00:57:00.550 --> 00:57:04.388 region:rollup2
BOTH IN TERMS OF ROADS

00:57:01.952 --> 00:57:06.023 region:rollup2
TRANSPORTATION AND HOUSING

00:57:04.388 --> 00:57:07.958 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE BECAUSE THOSE

00:57:06.023 --> 00:57:08.992 region:rollup2
THAT ARE DOING ALL OF THAT. AND

00:57:07.958 --> 00:57:11.028 region:rollup2
THAT ARE ACTUALLY BUILDING THE

00:57:08.992 --> 00:57:12.963 region:rollup2
RENO NUMBER. SHOULD BE FIRST IN

00:57:11.028 --> 00:57:13.964 region:rollup2
LINE AND THERE ARE COMMUNITIES

00:57:12.963 --> 00:57:15.432 region:rollup2
ARE GOING TO RESIST IT TO THE

00:57:13.964 --> 00:57:17.134 region:rollup2
END AND IF THEY WANT TO RESIST

00:57:15.432 --> 00:57:17.701 region:rollup2
IT THAT'S FINE BUT THEN THERE'S

00:57:17.134 --> 00:57:18.702 region:rollup2
NO OTHER STATE RESOURCES TO

00:57:17.701 --> 00:57:20.470 region:rollup2
COME.

00:57:18.702 --> 00:57:22.372 region:rollup2
COME THEIR WAY AND IT JUST IT

00:57:20.470 --> 00:57:23.707 region:rollup2
MAKES THE GOOD GUYS. GIVES THEM

00:57:22.372 --> 00:57:25.776 region:rollup2

I AM. I AM A BIG BELIEVER THAT

00:57:29.513 --> 00:57:32.449 region:rollup2
THE CARROTS GET YOU MOVING A LOT

00:57:30.981 --> 00:57:33.450 region:rollup2
FASTER THAN TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

00:57:32.449 --> 00:57:35.319 region:rollup2
HOW TO.

00:57:33.450 --> 00:57:35.919 region:rollup2
SMACK EVERYBODY UPSIDE THE HEAD

00:57:35.319 --> 00:57:38.021 region:rollup2

00:57:42.326 --> 00:57:45.028 region:rollup2
PROCESS RATHER THAN MAKE IT

00:57:43.994 --> 00:57:45.996 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT'S GOT MORE MORE

00:57:45.028 --> 00:57:47.965 region:rollup2

01:05:54.350 --> 01:05:56.986 region:rollup2
THE VOTERS WERE NOT GIVEN THE

ELECTED OR APPOINTED.

01:06:00.523 --> 01:06:04.160 region:rollup2
THERE IS NO OTHER COUNTY OFFICE

01:06:02.325 --> 01:06:06.029 region:rollup2
IN WHICH EXISTING LAW ALLOWS AN

01:06:04.160 --> 01:06:07.797 region:rollup2
APPOINTED OFFICE TO BE COMBINED

01:06:06.029 --> 01:06:09.299 region:rollup2
WITH AN ELECTED OFFICE WITHOUT

01:06:11.734 --> 01:06:16.005 region:rollup2
FOR EXAMPLE THE CLERK COUNTY

CLERK CANNOT BE CONSOLIDATED

01:06:16.005 --> 01:06:18.942 region:rollup2
WITH AN APPOINTED OFFICE AND

01:06:35.558 --> 01:06:38.795 region:rollup2
THIS SIMPLY REQUIRES THAT IF THE

01:06:37.126 --> 01:06:41.030 region:rollup2
BOARD OF SUPERVISORS WISHES TO

01:06:38.795 --> 01:06:42.532 region:rollup2

01:06:44.801 --> 01:06:47.904 region:rollup2

01:06:47.904 --> 01:06:51.541 region:rollup2
ELECTED OR APPOINTED.

01:06:49.806 --> 01:06:52.609 region:rollup2
THE AUTO LA ALREADY REQUIRES

01:06:51.541 --> 01:06:54.177 region:rollup2
THAT SWITCHING AN AUDITOR

01:06:52.609 --> 01:06:55.545 region:rollup2

REQUIREMENT.

01:07:09.158 --> 01:07:12.695 region:rollup2
EXISTING LAW REQUIRES THAT IF A

IT'S IMPERATIVE THAT VOTERS HAVE

FOR TAX COLLECTORS TO TAKE A

PROMINENT ROLE IN THIS IMPORTANT

01:09:46.616 --> 01:09:50.486 region:rollup2
ISSUE IF WE WERE ACCOUNTABLE TO

01:21:51.173 --> 01:21:54.710 region:rollup2
BY INNOCENT PARTY OR LOSS

01:21:52.975 --> 01:21:56.145 region:rollup2

01:22:11.160 --> 01:22:14.129 region:rollup2
FRUSTRATING.

01:22:12.795 --> 01:22:15.631 region:rollup2
WHEN YOU HAVE SOMEONE THAT'S

01:22:14.129 --> 01:22:16.932 region:rollup2

BEING FRAUD OR ILLEGAL ACTIVITY.

01:22:28.610 --> 01:22:32.614 region:rollup2

01:30:14.943 --> 01:30:19.114 region:rollup2
IT'S ACTUALLY THE COMBINATION

01:30:16.678 --> 01:30:20.882 region:rollup2
OF OF A NUMBER OF COMMENTS.

01:30:19.114 --> 01:30:21.850 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WHEN I WAS READING IT

01:30:20.882 --> 01:30:22.817 region:rollup2
WASN'T CLEAR TO ME THAT WE WERE

01:30:21.850 --> 01:30:25.086 region:rollup2
TALKING ABOUT COMMERCIAL

01:30:22.817 --> 01:30:27.022 region:rollup2

IN IT AND SO IT AND PART OF

01:30:32.127 --> 01:30:34.763 region:rollup2
WHAT I WAS STRUGGLING WITH IS

01:30:33.528 --> 01:30:35.163 region:rollup2
HOW WOULD YOU KNOW THAT

01:30:34.763 --> 01:30:36.331 region:rollup2
SOMEONE'S GROWING.

01:30:35.163 --> 01:30:38.500 region:rollup2
.

01:30:36.331 --> 01:30:40.168 region:rollup2
MARIJUANA. OTHER THAN PICKING

01:30:38.500 --> 01:30:43.038 region:rollup2
THROUGH THE WINDOWS.

01:30:40.168 --> 01:30:44.472 region:rollup2
ATE IT IT BE THERE'S USUALLY IF

01:30:43.038 --> 01:30:45.974 region:rollup2
THE SHERIFF'S OFFICE GETS

01:30:44.472 --> 01:30:47.542 region:rollup2
INFORMATION JUST USUALLY A TIP.

01:30:45.974 --> 01:30:49.711 region:rollup2
OR OR ITS SOMETHING THAT SOMEONE

01:30:47.542 --> 01:30:51.546 region:rollup2
HAS TOLD THEM OR THEY THERE IN A

01:30:49.711 --> 01:30:52.113 region:rollup2
PLACE WHERE THEY'RE. THEY'RE

ENTITLED TO BE IN THE SEA IT

01:30:52.113 --> 01:30:55.216 region:rollup2
BUT.

01:30:53.181 --> 01:30:58.453 region:rollup2
I WAS JUST STRUGGLING WITH HOW

01:30:55.216 --> 01:30:59.921 region:rollup2
HOW SO SO ONE IS I DO BELIEVE

01:30:58.453 --> 01:31:01.990 region:rollup2
THE RENTER SHOULD PAY THE FINE.

01:30:59.921 --> 01:31:04.392 region:rollup2
AYE AYE I BELIEVE THERE NEEDS

01:31:01.990 --> 01:31:06.761 region:rollup2
TO BE. A DIVERT DIFFERENTIATION

01:31:04.392 --> 01:31:08.129 region:rollup2
BETWEEN THE PLANTS THE NUMBER OF

01:31:06.761 --> 01:31:09.965 region:rollup2
PLANTS THAT ARE ALLOWED TO BE

01:31:08.129 --> 01:31:12.600 region:rollup2
GROWN.

01:31:09.965 --> 01:31:13.401 region:rollup2
UNDER PERSONALLY USE BY LAW AND

01:31:12.600 --> 01:31:14.836 region:rollup2
I DON'T REMEMBER WHAT THAT

01:31:13.401 --> 01:31:15.870 region:rollup2
NUMBER IS ANYMORE SIX SIX.

01:31:14.836 --> 01:31:19.040 region:rollup2
AND.

01:31:15.870 --> 01:31:20.575 region:rollup2
AND THAT IS EXCLUDED FROM THAT

01:31:19.040 --> 01:31:23.378 region:rollup2
FROM FROM THIS.

01:31:20.575 --> 01:31:24.946 region:rollup2
KIND OF OF OF CHANGE I GUESS IS

01:31:23.378 --> 01:31:26.481 region:rollup2
IS THE BEST WAY TO PUT IT. MY

01:31:24.946 --> 01:31:29.150 region:rollup2
THOSE ARE THE TWO WELL I THINK

01:31:26.481 --> 01:31:30.685 region:rollup2
THE EMPHASIS.

01:31:29.150 --> 01:31:31.486 region:rollup2
I WILL WORK WITH ALL THE FOLKS

01:31:30.685 --> 01:31:33.254 region:rollup2

01:31:31.486 --> 01:31:36.124 region:rollup2
ILLEGAL GROWS.

01:31:33.254 --> 01:31:37.425 region:rollup2
SO THAT EXCLUDES A LOT OF.

01:31:36.124 --> 01:31:38.526 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THE ALLOWABLE.

01:31:37.425 --> 01:31:41.830 region:rollup2

THE LAND LOW LORD KNOWS AT A

01:34:58.293 --> 01:35:00.361 region:rollup2
LATER TIME IT'S STILL THE SAME

01:34:59.794 --> 01:35:02.697 region:rollup2
OUTCOME BECAUSE THE TENANTS

01:35:00.361 --> 01:35:03.298 region:rollup2

01:35:02.697 --> 01:35:06.401 region:rollup2
SO YEARS OLD WHAT'S HAPPENING

01:35:13.208 --> 01:35:17.478 region:rollup2

EVEN KNOW THERE WAS.

01:35:22.150 --> 01:35:26.287 region:rollup2
I MEAN WHO WOULD INFORM THEM LAW

01:35:24.218 --> 01:35:26.888 region:rollup2
ENFORCEMENT OR HEAD OF THE.

01:35:26.287 --> 01:35:27.889 region:rollup2
KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT WE USUALLY

01:35:26.888 --> 01:35:29.524 region:rollup2
KNOW IF LAW ENFORCEMENT TELLS US

01:35:27.889 --> 01:35:30.992 region:rollup2
BUT THE LEGISLATURE'S BEEN VERY

01:35:29.524 --> 01:35:33.361 region:rollup2
CLEAR THAT TENANTS HAVE A RIGHT

01:35:30.992 --> 01:35:36.064 region:rollup2
TO PRIVACY WE HAVE NO RIGHT TO

01:35:33.361 --> 01:35:36.631 region:rollup2
PROACTIVELY INSPECT. ANTENNAS

01:35:36.064 --> 01:35:38.566 region:rollup2

CAN'T. YOU KNOW THEY WANT THEIR

01:35:38.566 --> 01:35:41.936 region:rollup2
RIGHT TO PRIVACY NOT JUST

01:35:40.268 --> 01:35:43.171 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THERE'S MORE ACTIVITY SO

01:35:41.936 --> 01:35:46.040 region:rollup2
WE DON'T HAVE THE RIGHT TO DO

01:35:43.171 --> 01:35:47.141 region:rollup2
THAT WE WOULD ONLY KNOW. IF WE

01:35:46.040 --> 01:35:50.845 region:rollup2
HAD A CLAIM.

01:35:47.141 --> 01:35:51.446 region:rollup2
WERE SHERIFFS OR EVEN TENANTS

01:35:50.845 --> 01:35:52.513 region:rollup2
IT TURNS ROUND EACH OTHER ALL

01:35:51.446 --> 01:35:55.216 region:rollup2
THE TIME FOR THINGS THAT ARE NOT

01:35:52.513 --> 01:35:56.584 region:rollup2
NECESSARILY ILLEGAL BUT YOU KNOW

01:35:55.216 --> 01:35:57.986 region:rollup2
THERE MATCH OTHER SO WE HAVE TO

01:35:56.584 --> 01:36:01.356 region:rollup2
BE. SENSITIVE THERE TOO.

01:35:57.986 --> 01:36:02.991 region:rollup2
SO USUALLY I WE DO NOW IS WHEN.

01:36:01.356 --> 01:36:04.225 region:rollup2
THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT HAS TOLD.

01:36:02.991 --> 01:36:05.994 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT HAS ALSO PAY THEIR

01:36:04.225 --> 01:36:07.495 region:rollup2
