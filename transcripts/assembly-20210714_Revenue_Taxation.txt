THANK YOU MEDICARE MEMBERS I DON'T THINK IT MAKES SENSE WELL THEN I DON'T THINK HIKES ON THERE NOW IT IS NOW IT IS THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS FOR HAVING THISSPECIAL HEARING TO HEAR SB ONE FOUR FOUR I WANT TO BEGIN BY THANKING THE CHAIR AND STAFF. FOR WORKING OVER THE WEEKEND TO GET US TO THIS POINT AND I ALSO WANT TO GIVE A SPECIAL RECOGNITION TO BOTH OF THE CHAIR AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER CARILLO FOR WORKING TO BRING SB ONE FOUR FOUR TO THE POINT WE'RE AT TODAY APPRECIATE COLLABORATION IT'S- WONDERFUL FOR THE SENATE IN THE ASSEMBLY TO WORK SO WELL TOGETHER ON AN IMPORTANT ISSUE FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND I KNOW MANY OF THE GOALS THAT ARE IN THE BILL OR WERE IMPORTANT TO BOTH OF YOU SO JUST WANT TO EXTEND A PERSONAL THANK YOU- SB ONE FOUR FOUR EXPANDS THE FILM AND TELEVISION TAX CREDIT PROGRAM WITH AN EMPHASIS ON INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT AND WORKFORCE DIVERSITY. ARE SIGNIFICANTLY THE BILL EXPANDS THE EXISTING TAX CREDIT BY NINETY MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE NEXT TWO YEARS THAT'S A TESTAMENT TO THE SUCCESS OF THE PRIOR TAX CREDITS THAT WE NEEDED TO INJECT MORE RESOURCES INTO A THREE POINT OUT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THE FUNDING NECESSARY TO ATTRACT AND KEEP. NOT FILM FOR. IN CALIFORNIA. AS YOU KNOW THIS IS A CORE INDUSTRY- ANNA STORK INDUSTRY. FOR OUR STATE AND IT'S A SOURCE OF PRIDE AND FRANKLY. MILLIONS OF PEOPLE HAVE MOVED TO CALIFORNIA SPECIFICALLY TO WORK IN THIS INDUSTRY AND I WAS ONE OF THEM- THIS. CREDIT THIS BILL ALSO INCLUDES. AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR A NEW FILM INFRASTRUCTURE CREDIT TO ENCOURAGE INVESTMENT IN STUDIOS AND SOUND STAGES IN CALIFORNIA AGAIN. A CREATURE OF THE PRIOR SUCCESS OF THE CURRENT TAX CREDITS IS WE'VE RUN OUT OF CAPACITY. AND SO WE BUILD MORE SOUND STAGES NOT ONLY WE HAVE MORE CURRENT PRODUCTIONS TODAY BUT WE'LL HAVE MORE PRODUCTIONS FOR DECADES SO. CAPACITY LEADS TO MORE JOBS WHICH IS ALSO AN ECONOMIC DRIVER IN SOMETHING IMPORTANT TO. EVERYONE IN THIS ROOM RIGHT NOW- THIS BILL ALSO ALLOWS PRODUCTION STERN A HIGHER PERCENTAGE OF CREDITS BY MEETING WORKFORCE DIVERSITY GOALS. THAT'S A SIGNIFICANT PIECE OF THE BILL- THE PRODUCTIONS WILL BE WILL. BE REQUIRED TO CREATE THEIR OWN DIVERSITY PLANS WHICH IS ALSO VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT'S A SELF. MONITORING EFFORT AND WILL COMPLY WITH STATE AND FEDERAL LAWS BY HAVING IT BE THAT WAY AND AGAIN I WANT TO GIVE. A SHOUT OUT TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER CARILLO FOR BEING SO PASSIONATE ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF DIVERSITY GOALS AND INCREASING A DIVERSE DIVERSE WORK FORCE. IN THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY THAT REFLECTS WHAT CALIFORNIA IS TODAY. THE BILL ALSO REQUIRES ADDITIONAL REPORTING RELATED TO WORKFORCE DIVERSITY THROUGHOUT THE FILM INDUSTRY AGAIN A VERY IMPORTANT STEP FORWARD. SB ONE FOUR FOUR IS VITALLY IMPORTANT TO CALIFORNIA FRANKLY I REPRESENT BURBANK AND GLENDALE HOME TO I THINK THE BEST DIDN'T. WITH ALL DUE RESPECT THE BEST DISTRICT IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND HOME TO MANY OF OUR LONG STANDING AND IMPORTANT STUDIO AND TV COMPANIES THAT HAVE BEEN PART OF THE FABRIC OF CALIFORNIA. FOR A HUNDRED YEARS FOR BACKGROUND THE EXODUS OF FILM AND TELEVISION PRODUCTIONS OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA. THREATEN ONE OF THIS HISTORIC INDUSTRIES ON OUR STATE. AND FOR DECADES PROVIDED GOOD STABLE MIDDLE CLASS MOSTLY WELL REPRESENTED UNION JOBS IN RECENT YEARS. IT HAD BECOME OBVIOUS THAT WE NEEDED TO ENHANCE THEM INCENTIVES TO LOWER BACK AND KEEP PRODUCTION IN CALIFORNIA. AND THE FIRST STEP WAS THE EXISTING FILM PRODUCTION TAX CREDITS. SB ONE FOUR FOUR BUILDS OFF ON THE RESOUNDING SUCCESS OF THESE CREDITS WHICH IS MOVED DOZENS OF PRODUCTIONS BACK TO SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA FILMING HAS INCREASED- I KNOW RECENTLY. GOOD GIANT FILM PRODUCTION THAT- USE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA AS IS ECHT EXTERIOR LOCATIONS BY EXPANDING EXISTING TAX CREDIT AND BY INVESTING IN THE MODERNIZATION OF THE STUDIO INFRASTRUCTURE. AND BUILDING OF NEW STUDIOS SB ONE FOUR FOUR WILL NOT ONLY PUT THOUSANDS OF HARDWORKING TRAITS PEOPLE TO WORK WILL ALSO ENSURE THAT ANOTHER GENERATION OF ENTERTAINMENT WILL BE CREATED. IN CALIFORNIA BY TRAINING THE NEXT GENERATION OF WORKERS FOR THIS INDUSTRY. ULTIMATELY THE BILL ENSURES THAT CALIFORNIA RIVER REMAINS THE GLOBAL LEADER IN ENTERTAINMENT PRODUCTION I ALSO WANT TO GIVE A BIG SHOUT OUT TO THE BUILDING TRADES WHICH HAVE BEEN. TIRELESSLY AND PASSIONATELY. SUPPORTIVE OF THIS EFFORT TO CREATE THESE CONSTRUCTION JOBS AND WE'RE HERE BECAUSE OF THOSE EFFORTS AS WELL SO ON THE PHONE I KNOW WE HAVE RON MILLER THE EXECUTIVE SECRETARY OF THE LOS ANGELES AND ORANGE COUNTY BUILDING TRADES. COUNCIL AND IN PERSON WE HAVE MELISSA PROTECT THE VICE PRESIDENT SENIOR COUNSEL THE MOTION PICTURE ASSOCIATION OF AMERICA. AND I BELIEVE WE ALSO HAVE SOMEBODY FROM DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ON THE LINE FOR TECHNICAL QUESTIONS AS WELL SO WITH THAT I'LL GO TO MY PRIMARY WITNESSES. FANTASTIC MODERATOR WE PLEASE CONNECT US WITH RON MILLER OF THE LOS ANGELES AND ORANGE COUNTY SPELLING TRAITS. PLEASE GO AHEAD MR MILLER. GOOD MORNING THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR HAVING ME CHAIR AND- COMMITTEE MEMBERS RON MILLER EXECUTIVE SECRETARY VALLEY ORANGE COUNTY BUILDING TRADES HERE ON BEHALF OF THE STATE BUILDING TRADES COUNCIL AND ALL THE FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND MEMBERS UP AND DOWN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IN SUPPORT OF SB ONE FORTY FOUR THIS BILL SEEKS TO KEEP CALIFORNIA THE GLOBAL LEADER IN ENTERTAINMENT PRODUCTION. SB ONE FORTY FOUR BILLS OFF THE RESOUNDING SUCCESS OF CALIFORNIA'S FILM TAX CREDIT WHICH IS MOVED DOZENS OF PRODUCTIONS BACK TO SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA FOLLOWING A DECADE LONG DECLINE IN HOLLYWOOD. SINCE ITS INCEPTION THE FILM TAX CREDIT IS GENERATED SIX BILLION DOLLARS WITH IN CALIFORNIA DESPITE OUR EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLAR IN INCENTIVES FROM THE STATE. IN TURN PRODUCTIONS ELIGIBLE FOR CREDIT BENEFIT LOCAL BUSINESSES AND COMMUNTIES BY EMPLOYING RENTAL AND STORAGE COMPANIES CATERING BUSINESSES INCREASING PARKING REVENUE PERMITTING REVENUE. FOR THESE RIVAS REASONS EXPERTS HAVE ESTIMATED THAT EVERY PRODUCTION AMOUNTS AMOUNT MULTIPLIED BY THREE FOR ECONOMIC GROWTH. IN MANY WAYS SB ONE FORTY FOUR MARES EXISTING FILM TAX CREDIT PROGRAM BUT IT'S FORMULATED SPECIFICALLY. FOR STUDIO CONSTRUCTION AND RENOVATION PROJECTS CERTIFIED BY THE CALIFORNIA FILM COMMISSION IN ORDER TO QUALIFY FOR THE CREDIT ELIGIBLE PRODUCTS MUST BE BUILT INTEREST IN STATE MEET APPROPRIATE COST THRESHOLDS. AND SUBJECT TO PROBATE PREVAILING WAGE AND SKILLED AND TRAINED WORKFORCE REQUIREMENTS. THESE RECALL. FOR WHAT PROVIDE A PATHWAY TO GOOD MIDDLE CLASS CAREERS FOR THE FUTURE WORKFORCE OF CALIFORNIA. AND THE STATE BUILDING TRADES UP AND DOWN THE STATE HAVE EMBRACED THESE PROGRAMS AND PARTICIPATE IN- WHOLEHEARTEDLY. AND NOW THE STATE BUILDING TRADES- MEMBERSHIP LOOKS LIKE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE HAVE BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL IN WORKING IN COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. TO PUT PEOPLE INTO THE APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS. THEM AND BUILD THE WORKFORCE OF TOMORROW. OVER THE PAST YEAR NEVER HAVE MARKETS BEEN SO GRATEFUL FOR CALIFORNIA MADE ENTERTAINMENT THIS STREAMED. THEM THROUGH AN OTHERWISE LONELY TIME. ALTHOUGH PRODUCTION WAS SHATTERED FOR A LARGE PART OF THE YEAR THIS YEAR DUE TO A COLBERT PEDANTIC WE BELIEVE THAT EFFORTS LIKE SB ONE FORTY FOUR WILL ALLOW THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA. TO NOT ONLY RECOVER BUT TO GROW. BY INVESTING IN THE FUTURE OF THE IN STATE ENTERTAINMENT WE'RE SUPPORTING A CRUCIAL INDUSTRY MILLIONS OF JOBS AND ENSURING THAT CALIFORNIA REMAINS THE GLOBAL LEADER FOR ENTERTAINMENT CREATION AND PRODUCTION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH PLEASE SUPPORT THIS BILL. THANK YOU I UNDERSTAND THE NEXT PRIMARY WITNESS IN SUPPORT IS IN PERSON. MOSA PATAK THE MOTION PICTURE ASSOCIATION OF AMERICA. CHAIR BIRTH MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I AM MELISSA PATAK VICE PRESIDENT SENIOR COUNSEL FOR STATE GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS WITH THE MOTION PICTURE ASSOCIATION THE MPA IS THE TRADE ASSOCIATION FOR THE LEADING PRODUCERS AND DISTRIBUTORS OF MOTION PICTURES TELEVISION PROGRAMS AND STREAMING SERIES. OUR MEMBERS INCLUDE DISNEY NBCUNIVERSAL NETFLIX PARAMOUNT PICTURES SONY PICTURES AND WARNER BROTHERS MPA SUPPORTS SB ONE FORTY FOUR. THIS BILL HAS THREE ELEMENTS INCENTIVIZING THE CONSTRUCTION AND RENOVATION OF SOUNDSTAGES ASSURING CONTINUITY OF RECURRING TV SERIES AND ENHANCING DIVERSITY. WE APPRECIATE THE LEADERSHIP OF THE BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION TRADE UNIONS AND WORKING WITH SENATOR PORTANTINO ON LEGISLATION EARLIER THIS YEAR TO INCENTIVIZE THE CONSTRUCTION AND RENOVATION OF SOUNDSTAGES. MPA WAS A PLEASED TO SUPPORT THAT BILL AND WE SUPPORT INCORPORATING IT INTO THIS BILL ALONG WITH THE ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR THE RECURRING TV SERIES. WE ALSO ACKNOWLEDGE AND APPRECIATE THE HARD WORK OF THE ENTERTAINMENT UNIONS INCLUDING IATSE TEAMSTERS THE LABOR SAG AFTRA AND THE DIRECTORS GUILD ON BOTH THE INFRASTRUCTURE BILL AND THE TAX CREDITS FOR RECURRING TV SERIES. TOGETHER THE MPA AND ENTERTAINMENT UNIONS COALITION HAVE ADVOCATED FOR THE CALIFORNIA FILM AND TELEVISION PRODUCTION TAX CREDIT PROGRAM OVER MANY YEARS. THE RESULTS ARE SELF EVIDENT. FROM THE CALIFORNIA FILM COMMISSION'S MOST RECENT DECEMBER TWENTY TWENTY PROGRESS REPORT WE KNOW THAT THE STATE'S INVESTMENT OF ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IN TAX CREDITS HAS YIELDED ELEVEN POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS IN DIRECT IN STATE SPENDING. BETWEEN TWENTY FIFTEEN AND TWENTY TWENTY THE PRODUCTIONS RECEIVING TAX CREDITS HAVE HIRED ALMOST FORTY FOUR THOUSAND CREW MEMBERS AND MORE THAN THIRTY FOUR THOUSAND CAST MEMBERS. AND THIS PROGRAM IS ATTRACTED TWENTY SIX TELEVISION SERIES BACK TO CALIFORNIA FROM OTHER LOCALES. THE ADDITIONAL FUNDING PROVIDED FOR RECURRING TV SERIES WILL NAY IT WILL ENABLE THOSE PROJECTS TO CONTINUE HERE IN CALIFORNIA. EMPLOYING CALIFORNIANS AND ENGAGING CALIFORNIA LOCAL BUSINESSES TO SUPPLY GOODS AND SERVICES TO THESE PRODUCTIONS. THIS IS A LIMITED ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR THIS FISCAL YEAR AND NEXT. THE OTHER PART OF THIS BILL CREATES A PROGRAM WITHIN THE EXISTING PRODUCTION TAX CREDIT PROGRAM TO INCENTIVIZE THE BUILDING AND RENOVATION OF SOUNDSTAGES IN CALIFORNIA. IN ORDER TO CONTINUE TO GROW PRODUCTION AND THE GOOD MIDDLE CLASS UNION JOBS. CALIFORNIA NEEDS MORE SOUND STAGES. THE PROVISIONS OF SB ONE FORTY FOUR WILL INCENTIVIZE PRIVATE INVESTMENT IN PRODUCTION INFRASTRUCTURE. TO CREATE THOUSANDS OF NEW JOBS BY PROVIDING PRODUCTION INCENTIVES TO PROJECTS THAT WILL BE LOCATED IN THESE NEWLY BUILT OR RENOVATED SOUNDSTAGES. THOSE STAGES WILL BE BUILT TO RENOVATED AND MAINTAINED BY UNION WORKERS AMONG OTHER REQUIREMENTS IN THE BILL. DISINCENTIVE ENSURES LONG TERM RETURNS FOR CALIFORNIA FOR A RELATIVELY SHORT INVESTMENT PERIOD. BY WAY OF ILLUSTRATION MOST OF THE STUDIOS IN CALIFORNIA BUILT THEIR SOUND STAGES IN THE NINETEEN TWENTIES AND THIRTIES. BUT THEY ARE ALL STILL WORKING TODAY. THE LIFE SANTA LIFESPAN OF A SOUND STAGE IS MORE THAN A CENTURY. FOR THE APPROXIMATELY THREE YEARS THIS BILL CREATES INCENTIVES FOR THE BUILDING AND RENOVATION OF SOUNDSTAGES. CALIFORNIA WILL GET. MORE THAN NINETY YEARS OF PRODUCTION WORK AND THE ACCOMPANYING JOBS FROM THEM IN THE FUTURE. FINALLY THIS BILL ADDS SOME NEW PROVISIONS ON DIVERSITY FOR THE GENERAL PRODUCTION TAX CREDIT PROGRAM THIS BILL IMPROVES THE COLLECTION OF DATA ABOUT THE WORK FORCE FOR EACH PRODUCTION. THE BILL REQUIRES WORKFORCE INFORMATION TO BE PROVIDED TO THE CALIFORNIA FILM COMMISSION PRIOR TO THE ISSUANCE OF A TAX CREDIT CERTIFICATE AT THE END OF THE PRODUCTION WHEN. THERE'S A LOT OF INFORMATION ABOUT WHO WAS ACTUALLY HIRED. AND FOR THOSE PRODUCTIONS THAT WILL BE LOCATED ON THE NEW OR RENOVATED INFRASTRUCTURE THEY WILL BE ELIGIBLE FOR AN ADDITIONAL AMOUNT OF TAX CREDIT. IN ORDER TO GET A TOP LEFT PRODUCTIONS WILL HAVE TO ACHIEVE A WORK FORCE PLAN APPROVED BY THE CALIFORNIA FILM COMMISSION THAT REPRESENTS CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU FOR HEARING THIS BILL AT THIS TIME. WE ARE CHEN AYE VOTE ON SB ONE FORTY FOUR I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS AND AGAIN THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU IS THERE ANYONE WISHING TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT VIA REMOTE STATION AT THIS TIME.

ONE FORTY FOUR. NO PARTICIPANTS ARE QUEUING UP GREAT IS THERE ANY OPPOSITION IN THE VIDEO REMOTE CENTER. SEEING NINE ANY OPPOSITION HERE IN THE HEARING ROOM. NINE COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. DR CORK. SO IF THERE'S ANY YEAR WE HAVE SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS AVAILABLE THIS IS A- WHAT BUT- WHAT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THE BILL IS THAT IT CAN TAKE MONEY AWAY FROM OTHER PURPOSES- AND GIVE IT SO YOU'RE GIVING THIS THE HIGHEST PRIORITY WHY IS THAT. WELL I THINK THERE'S A SIMPLE QUESTION. YOU KNOW WHEN YOU LOOK AT AN INCENTIVE IT'S TO CREATE MORE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND MORE JOBS IT CREATES MORE OF AN ECONOMIC BENEFIT. FROM PRIMING THE PUMP THEN THE ACTUAL DOLLARS IN A STATIC. THE COUNTY SYSTEM THAT'S ONE OF THE CHALLENGES WE HAVE IN THE LEGISLATURE IS WE BUDGET IN A STATIC EXPENDITURE MODEL NOT AN INVESTMENT MODEL THIS MONEY WILL LEAD TO BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT WHICH WILL CREATE MORE TAX REVENUE WHICH WILL CREATE. MORE JOBS WILL CREATE MORE. WAGES AND BENEFITS THE STATE GREATER THAN THE INVESTMENT RIGHT NOW THAT I UNDERSTAND WHEN I WHEN I DON'T KNOW IS WHY YOU'RE TAKING MONEY FROM THE OTHER THREE HUNDRED THIRTY MILLION. THAT WAS DESIGNATED FOR OTHER PURPOSES. IF THERE ISN'T ENOUGH IF THERE'S A GREATER TAX CREDIT FOR THE SEVENTY FIVE MILLION WHAT CHANGES. IF YOU IF YOU. OVER IF YOU SPEND ALL THE SEVENTY FIVE MILLION ON THIS TAX CREDIT. THEN YOU TAKE AWAY AND THEN AND THERE'S STILL MORE PEOPLE WHO WANT TO BUILD. THEN YOU'RE TAKING AWAY MONEY FROM OTHER FUNDS WITHIN THE THREE HUNDRED THIRTY MILLION. NO THE PRODUCTIONS GET IN LINE AND COMPETE WITH THE PROTECTIONS THAT ARE ALREADY IN THE QUEUE FOR THAT THREE HUNDRED THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS AND THEIR SAFEGUARDS. WITHIN THE BILL TO PROTECT IT FROM BEING OVER PRESCRIBED WHICH IS THE SITUATION THAT WE'RE IN TODAY- IT THERE SEEMS TO BE SOMEBODY WILL WIN THE- HE WATCHED ANSWER THE QUESTIONS. MADAM CHAIR BECAUSE THE TOPIC WOULD YOU LIKE TO ANSWER. THANK YOU MELISSA TACK WITH THE MOTION PICTURE ASSOCIATION SO I THINK ASSEMBLY MEMBER OF QUICK YOU'RE REFERRING TO THE SECTION IN THE BILL THAT SAYS- IF THERE'S A SHORTFALL IN THE FUTURE. YOU TAKE FROM RELOCATING TV OR FROM RECURRING TV AND FROM FEATURE FILM SO ON. THIS SHORTFALL IS THERE IS A- WELL A SHORTFALL IS NEVER A GOOD SITUATION THIS IS A RESULT OF GOOD NEWS ANOTHER'S WE'VE ATTRACTED SO MANY RELOCATING TV SERIES. ON THERE IS A SPECIAL BUCKET AS YOU KNOW IN THE PROGRAM FOR RELOCATING TV SERIES BUT ONCE THAT RELOCATING TV SERIES IS HERE FOR A YEAR AND THEN WITH LUCK IT GETS REDUCED BECAUSE IT'S A SUCCESSFUL TV SERIES. IT THEN SHARES FROM THE POT OF RECURRING TV AND WE'VE NOW ATTRACTED SO MANY RELOCATING TV SERIES. THAT THERE AREN'T. A TV SERIES AND NOW THIS ANTI IN ALICE'S. I'M SORRY IT ALSO COMES FROM FEATURE FILM YES THOUGH IT WE HOPE THAT THAT DOES NOT COME TO PASS FEATURE FILMS ARE REALLY IMPORTANT PRIORITY IN THE FILM TAX CREDIT PROGRAM I AND WE IT WOULD BE YOU KNOW THESE ARE LAST RESORTS FOR A SITUATION THAT WE REALLY DON'T BELIEVE WILL COME TO PASS BUT IT'S A THEIR **** PRECAUTIONARY. LANGUAGE JUST IN CASE THANK YOU IF I COULD ADD MANAGER YOU ALSO NEED TO CREATE THE STABILITY OF THOSE PRODUCTIONS TO KNOW THAT IF THEY ARE ON GOING THAT THEY HAVE OPPORTUNITY TO CONTINUETO RECEIVE- WITH THE PROTECTION OF THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND- FOR PUT IN THE BILL SO THAT'S ALSO PART OF IT IS THAT STABILITY FACTOR. THANK YOU MISS PEACH IN ARMS WILL JUST GO DOWN THIS. PATH THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. AND GOOD MORNING SENATOR GOOD TO SEE YOU ARE LET ME LET ME START BY SAYING THAT I AM HAPPY TO SUPPORT SB ONE FORTY FOUR TODAY. I THINK YOU AND AT YOUR SUPPORTERS HAVE MADE A REALLY COMPELLING CASE. FOR THE ADVOCACY AS THESE TAX CREDITS I THINK YOU YOU SPOKE TO THE RESOUNDING SUCCESS AT THESE TAX CREDITS IN. CREATING GOOD JOBS IN STIMULATING ECONOMIC GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT. I'M BUT I ALSO DO YOU WANT TO ADD THAT AS I LISTEN TO THIS CONVERSATION I KIND OF TAKE A STEP BACK. I'M IT DOES LEAVE ME A LITTLE BIT SCRATCHING MY HEAD ABOUT OUR- TAX POLICY MORE BROADLY. ON BECAUSE WHEN WE TALK ABOUT TAX CREDITS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE'VE GOT SOME REALLY REALLY UNIMPORTANT. REALLY IMPORTANT UNFINISHED BUSINESS FROM. LAST BUDGET YEAR SO IS EVERYONE WILL RECALL I IN. THE LAST BUDGET CYCLE WE% THOUGHT WE WERE FACING A HISTORIC BUDGET DEFICIT A THIRTY FOUR BILLION DOLLAR BUDGET DEFICIT AMONGST OTHER THINGS- WE ENACTED AB EIGHTY FIVE. WHICH SUSPENDED AT THE NET OPERATING LOSS UTILIZATION AND ALSO IMPOSED A CAP OF FIVE MILLION DOLLARS ON THE AMOUNT AT BUSINESS INCENTIVE TAX CREDITS THAT COMPANIES CAN UTILIZE- FOR THE NEXT THREE YEARS. THAT INCLUDES THE- JOB TAX CREDIT THE MOTION PICTURE PRODUCTION CREDIT THE CALIFORNIA COMPETES CREDIT. AND THE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT. TAX CREDIT. ON SO IN MY VIEW. AT NOW THAT WE FIND OURSELVES IN. THE A REMARKABLY AND BLESSEDLY A MUCH DIFFERENT A MUCH BETTER POSITION WE'VE GOT A SEVENTY FIVE BILLION DOLLAR. BUDGET SURPLUS. I THINK IN IN IN ADDITION TO AN ACTING SB ONE FORTY FOUR. I WOULD LIKE TO SEE US RESTORE. TAX CREDITS MORE BROADLY AND LIFT THAT CAP MORE BROADLY I THINK IT'S ACTUALLY. FIVE THURMOND UNCONSCIONABLE THAT WE ARE ACCRUING NOT LIABILITY RIGHT NOW FOR THE OUT YEARS PARTICULARLY IN LIGHT AND AS I SAID WHAT I FELT WAS A VERY COMPELLING CASE YOU MADE FOR JUST HOW IMPORTANT. THESE TAX CREDITS ARE IN SO MANY INDUSTRIES IN CREATING GOOD JOBS AND STIMULATING ECONOMIC GROWTH SO ON LIKE I SAID HAPPY TO SUPPORT SB ONE FORTY FOUR TODAY AND LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH. THE FILM INDUSTRY WITH ODD LIFE SCIENCES INDUSTRY WITH TECH INDUSTRY AND OTHERS TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE GLAD MAKING SMART INVESTMENTS TO STIMULATE GROWTH. IN REGIONS ACROSS THE STATE AND INDUSTRIES ALL ACROSS THE STATE. DEPT THANK YOU SENATOR THANK YOU. I GUESS WE ALL GET TO TALK- CENTER THANK YOU FOR- TAKE A TAKEN THIS ON- AS SOMEONE WHO HAS HAD FAMILY MEMBERS- IN THE INDUSTRY SINCE THE FORTIES- I CAN TELL YOU HOW IMPORTANT THE FILM INDUSTRY HAS BEEN. AND A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK IT'S JUST AFFECTS THE THEY SEE THE ACTORS AND THE ACTRESSES BUT THEY DON'T REALIZE THE PEOPLE THAT WORK BEHIND THE SCENES- TO MAKE ALL THAT HAPPEN- IT WORKING IN THE CITY OF INGLEWOOD WE HAD A LOT OF FILMING GOING ON IN THE EIGHTIES AND NINETIES. AND THEN ALL THE SUDDEN IT DRIED UP. AND NONE OF THESE FOLKS ONE OF MY GOOD COLLEAGUES HERE- WERE. IN IN THE ASSEMBLY OR THE OR IN THE LEGISLATURE AT THE TIME- BUT WE ENACTED SOME POLICIES- THAT THE FILM INDUSTRY SAID. IF YOU GUYS KEEP DOING THIS WE'RE WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE IN CALIFORNIA. IN IN THE FILM INDUSTRY WAS BORN IN CALIFORNIA BELONGS IN CALIFORNIA. AND SO. YOU KNOW IT'S KIND OF A LESSON LEARNED. BECAUSE HERE WE ARE. A DECADE AND A HALF LATER- LURING THEM BACK. WITH TAX INCENTIVES WHICH IS YOU KNOW IF THAT'S WHAT WE GOTTA DO THEN THAT'S WHAT WE GOTTA DO. BUT WE SHOULD NOT CHASE THEM OUT IN THE FIRST PLACE AND WE NEED TO RE LOOK AT SOME OF WE NEED TO LEARN FROM HISTORY. ABOUT SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE DO TO IMPACT WE CAN'T SOMEONE KNOWS IT AN INDUSTRY LIKE THAT. BECAUSE THOSE THOUSANDS OF JOBS I HAD YEAH I HAD COUSINS THEY HAD TO RETIRE EARLY. AND NEVER TRADE YEAH THEY WERE UNION WORKERS- I HAD OTHER FRIENDS THAT HAD TO TRAIN PEOPLE FROM OTHER STATES THAT WERE TAKEN THEIR JOBS- IT WAS PAINFUL FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE. AND HOPEFULLY WE CAN LEARN OUR LESSONS FROM WHAT HAPPENED- WE CAN LOOK BACK AND SEE WHAT IT WAS THAT. WAS WHAT'S HAPPENING AT THE TIME THAT MADE IT SO. UNTENABLE FOR SUCH AN IMPORTANT INDUSTRY TO BE IN CALIFORNIA. AND AND HOPEFULLY WE CAN NEVER REPEAT THAT AGAIN. BECAUSE THOSE TYPE OF INDUSTRIES AND THAT KIND OF ECONOMIC VITALITY. IS SO TERRIBLY IMPORTANT. TO OUR STATE. AND TO ALL OF THE ALL OF THE PEOPLE THAT LIVE HERE- A LOT OF OUR PROBLEMS ARE SOLVED WHEN THEY'RE WORKING IN THE WORKING THESE KIND OF JOBS. SO ANYWAY I APPLAUD THAT WE'RE WE'RE FINALLY LURING THEM BACK AND I HOPE THAT CONTINUES THANK YOU. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR SENATOR SO GOOD TO SEE YOU- AND REALLY REALLY GLAD THAT WE WERE ABLE TO PARTNER IN CREATING- THIS BILL THAT REALLY CATERS TO A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT. TYPE OF WORKERS BOTH BELOW THE LINE ABOVE THE LINE I WANT TO- JUST SHARES A LITTLE BIT OF SOME TO- STATISTICS RELATED TO EQUITY AND DIVERSITY WHICH AS YOU MENTIONED IS SOMETHING THAT WE WORKED REALLY REALLY HARD ON. AND BUDGETS UP FOR AND I WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT TO JUST THINK. GENEVIEVE MORE- WHAT IS WITH THE COMMITTEE AND BUDGET FOR ALL OF HER WORK IN RESEARCH AND DEDICATION. TO THE ISSUE OF EQUITY AND DIVERSITY OFTENTIMES. YOU KNOW WE SPEAK ABOUT BEING THE ONLY WOMEN IN THE ROOM SOMETIMES THE ONLY WOMEN OF COLOR IN THE ROOM SOMETIMES OFTEN THE ONLY BROWN WOMAN IN THE ROOM. AND THE IMPORTANCE OF WHAT THAT IS THIS YEAR WE ALSO LAUNCHED THE INITIATIVE FOR UNSEEN LATINOS AND I WANT TO SHARE JUST A LITTLE BIT OF WHAT WE DISCUSSED AND- THE NC LEVINE AS HOLLYWOOD- HEARING THAT WE HAD IN TWENTY NINETEEN. THE USC ANNENBERG INCLUSION INITIATIVE- PUBLISHED A REPORT THAT'S VERY SIMILAR TO THE UCLA REPORT THAT WAS PUBLISHED EARLIER THIS YEAR. THEY LOOKED AT TWELVE HUNDRED TOP GROSSING FILMS FROM THOSE FINDINGS OF THE TOP ONE HUNDRED GROSSING DOMESTIC FEATURES FOR THE PAST TWELVE YEARS. LET ME KNOW CHARACTER MAKE UP ONLY FOUR POINT 5% OF ALL SPEAKING ROLES AND NAMED CHARACTERS. OUT IN THE TOP ONE HUNDRED FILMS FROM TWENTY EIGHTEEN FORTY SEVEN FILMS. WERE COMPLETELY MISSING LATINO CHARACTER SEVENTY FILMS WERE MISSING LATINAS NINETY FIVE DID NOT FEATURE LATINO CHARACTERS WITH A DISABILITY NINETY EIGHT WERE MISSING AT THE NOTES FROM THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY. ONLY 4% OF DIRECTORS AND 3% OF PRODUCERS IN THESE MOVIES WERE LATINO ONLY ONE AT THE NOT DIRECTOR WORKED ACROSS THE TWELVE HUNDRED FILMS EXAMINED. 47% OF THE TWELVE HUNDRED MOVIES IN THE REPORT. SAMPLED COMPLETELY ERASED LATINO SPEAKING ROLES. THIS IS SERIOUS FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA LATINOS REPRESENT. THE LARGEST- POLLUTION ACROSS THE IN THE- AS GROWING A THE- WHO TELLS OUR STORIES HOW THE STORIES ARE TOLD IN WHO WRITES THEM. IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT- AND I HAVE A- A SLIGHT- JUST DISAGREEMENT AND YOU SAYING THAT YOU HAVE THE BEST DISTRICTS THAT I HAVE THE BEST DISTRICT. BUT WE SHARED THIS BUSINESS AND COMMON YOU HAVE THE PRODUCTION SOUNDSTAGES IN BURBANK AND GLENDALE AND SURROUNDING COMMUNITIES. I HAVE THE CREATIVES I HAVE THE WRITERS PRODUCERS DIRECTORS ACTORS. AND ALL THE FOLKS IN THE APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS ON THE BELOW THE LINE. AND I THINK WHAT WE'RE CREATING AT THIS MOMENT IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR A REAL SHIFT. IN WHICH PUBLIC DOLLARS ARE USED TO ENSURE. THAT BOTH BELOW THE LINE AND ABOVE THE LINE WORKERS ARE REFLECTIVE OF THE STATE. I WANT TO APPLAUD. THE BUILDING TRADES SPECIALLY MISTER. RON MILLER WHO TESTIFIED OVER THE PHONE AND- CONGRATULATE HIM ON HIS STEP BACK AT STEADFAST COMMITMENT TO LABOR IN HIS RETIREMENT. IN AUGUST BUT THE TRADES HAVE DONE AN INCREDIBLE JOB. IN CREATING THE PLATFORM IN WHICH THEY ARE ABLE TO- HAVE DATA RELATED TO GENDER TO RACE ETHNICITY FOR THEIR WORK FORCE. WHICH HAS ENABLED THEM TO ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO TALK ABOUT. ALL THE COMMUNITIES AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES THAT THEY SERVE. WE GET TO SHIFT THAT NOW IN DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF LABOR TO ENSURE THAT. APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS EXPAND. TO DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT PIECES. IS ACTUALLY ENSURING THAT THE FILM TAX COMMISSION BEGINS TO COLLECT THE DATA. IN HEARINGS THAT I HAD AND SO FOR. WE WERE OFTEN TOLD THAT THE FILM COMMISSION DOES NOT HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO CREATE DATA. TO COLLECT THE DATA WE'RE SHIFTING THAT TO ENSURE THAT. ANY PRODUCTION MOVING FORWARD IN THE SOUND STAGES THAT ARE BEING NEWLY CREATED. THE PRODUCTION COMPANIES HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO CREATE A WORKFORCE PLAN THAT IS DIVERSE THAT IS EQUITABLE. THAT BEGINS TO OPEN UP AVENUES IN WHICH- REALLY THE WORK FORCE BOTH BELOW AND ABOVE THE LINE LOOKS LIKE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND I THINK THAT'S INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT- NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT HOW. HOW WE GET TO DO THAT. AND CHANGING HAS TAX LIKE OSCARS SO WHITE. BUT HOW WE ACTUALLY CREATE A PATHWAY. IN WHICH THAT ACTUALLY GETS TO HAPPEN AND I THINK THAT'S EXCITING IT'S INNOVATIVE IT'S NEW.

OPRY SURPLUS- A DECISION THAT WAS MADE- FROM FOR FISCAL REASONS ON THAT LIFE SCIENCES CREDIT- I SHOULD TELL YOU ABOUT THAT LIFE SCIENCES PIECES PERSONAL TO ME A SIMILAR STORY I GREW UP IN THE BIRTHPLACE OF BIOTECHNOLOGY CELL.

THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- I'D LIKE TO THANK YOU SENATOR FOR WORKING ON THIS CRITICAL ISSUE I KNOW HOW PASSIONATE YOU ARE ABOUT THIS REPRESENT A LOT OF STUDIOS AND IN YOUR DISTRICT AND- AS YOUR NEIGHBOR- AND- SOME OVERLAP A LOT OF WORKERS LIVE IN MY DISTRICT ESPECIALLY- BELOW THE LINE- SO I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THIS WORK- I ALSO APPRECIATE THE EFFORTS THAT THIS BILL- IS MAKING AN ENSURING THAT DIVERSITY- WITHIN THIS INDUSTRY- IS INCLUDED IN THIS SPELL I'M LIKE MY COLLEAGUE FROM LOS ANGELES MENTIONED. I WANT TO ALSO THANK HER FOR HER WORK ON THIS TO ENSURING THAT THIS WAS PART OF THIS MEASURE IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO ME THAT THIS INDUSTRY REFLECTS CALIFORNIA AND THE AREAS THAT- IS THAT IT TAKES PLACE IN WHICH IS A LOT OF OUR DISTRICTS- YOU KNOW MY DISTRICT IS MAJORITY LATINO- AND WE HAVE VERY FEW LATINOS IN THIS INDUSTRY- AND I WOULD LIKE TO WORK WITH YOU TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT IS NOT THE CASE IN THE FUTURE- AND THAT WE CONTINUE TO WORK TOWARDS THOSE pADDED AS A CO AUTHOR TO THIS BILL AND I DEFINITELY SUPPORTING TODAY- THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK. ON THESE AND ISSUES. S. MISTER MERION TO CHECK SOMETHING SO JUSTIN A KEEP A HUNDRED HERE- AT IS SPUR OF ALL CENTER THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT I'M GONNA IT BUT I A FIND INTO SO COLLEAGUE COMMON I JUST WANTED TO SHOW. THE TOO QUICK POINTS OUT FIRST OF ALL- IT I WAS VERY OF HAVING A- IN IN WORK N FIRST- INCENTIVE. WHICH TOOK YEARS AND YEARS TO DO MUCH TO THE- FRUSTRATION OF FAILED EFFORTS OF THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY BECAUSE- THERE WASN'T THE INTEREST TO SUPPORT THE INDUSTRY AND- AND AS- ONE OF OUR COLLEAGUES WAS PREVIOUSLY MENTIONING. AT THE INDUSTRY STARTED LEAVING AND SO IT WAS DURING THE LAST ECONOMIC DOWNTURN THAT WE FINALLY. MAYBE APPROPRIATE INVESTMENT. SO IF WE'VE LEARNED A LESSON FROM THAT- WHEN WE LOOK AT THE LARGEST. BUDGET THAT WE VOTED ON AT TWO HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE BILLION WHICH DWARFS THE BUDGET OF TEN YEARS AGO DURING THE ECONOMIC DOWNTURN. THAT WAS LESS THAN. LESS THAN HALF OF WHAT WE HAVE NOW AND WE HAD A SEVERE BUDGET HOLD BACK THEN. ALL WE'VE LEARNED IS THAT THIS IS GOING TO COME BACK AND HAPPEN AGAIN IN A FEW YEARS SO IT'S INVESTMENTS LIKE THIS THAT ALLOW ARE CRITICAL- INDUSTRIES TO SURVIVE. THOSE HORRIBLE FURROWS THAT WE DEAL WITH SO JUST BECAUSE WE'RE IN THE PEAK RIGHT NOW WE SHOULD BE EXTREMELY CAREFUL TO MAKE THE APPROPRIATE INVESTMENTS FOR THOSE THROWS THAT WE'RE GONNA BE DEALING WITH SO. I WHOLEHEARTEDLY SUPPORT THIS- WOULD LIKE TO JOIN YOU AS A CO AUTHOR AS WELL AND- IF THE BILL HASN'T BEEN MOVED YET WOULD LIKE TO MOVE THE BILL AS WELL WE HAVE A MOTION FROM CARILLO AND A SECOND FROM- MISTER NAZARIAN. I JUST WANT TO SAY A FEW WORDS THIS TAX CREDIT- AS IT'S BEEN STATED HAS GENERATED SIX TIMES THE INVESTMENT AND WHICH MAKES IT A VERY SUCCESSFUL TAX CREDIT WE NOT ALL OF OUR TAX CREDITS CAN. CAN PROVE THAT. AND THIS ONE HAS. I WANT TO THANK THE SENATOR FOR HIS COMMITMENT AND HIS DILIGENCE. ON THIS ISSUE I WON I THINK- REAL FOR HER WORK ON THE DIVERSITY PORTION EACH PART OF THE BILL THAT YOU GUYS HAVE WORKED ON HAS A DIRECT EFFECT ON. MY FAMILY- IN OUR HOUSEHOLD AT MY DAUGHTER'S FATHER. TWENTY YEARS AGO NOW I REMEMBER HIM WORKING IN LOS ANGELES ALL THE TIME HE WAS HOME ALL THE TIME OR IS THIS YEAR. HE'S BEEN HOME LESS THAN TWENTY DAYS MISSING HIS DAUGHTER'S SEVENTH BIRTHDAY. SO THAT HE COULD WORK BECAUSE OTHER STATES HAVE PULLED THEM BUSINESS AWAY FROM CALIFORNIA- SO FOR MY DAUGHTER. AND FOR MYSELF AND FOR HER FATHER WHO STOOD IN MY GARAGE CRYING OUT A WEEK AGO THAT HE HAS NOT SEEN AS CHILD ENOUGH BECAUSE OF WORK. I WANT TO THANK YOU. I WOULD ALSO RECOMMEND THAT FOR SOME OF THESE OTHER TAX CREDIT SO WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT THAT WE HAVEN'T YOU KNOW THAT WE HAVE TO DISCUSS I WOULD ENCOURAGE THEM TO ALSO IMPLORE AND MAYBE TALK TO MR CREEL ABOUT CREATING A DIVERSITY PORTION OF THOSE. TAX CREDITS AS WELL. I THINK IT WOULD BEHOOVE THEM. WITH THAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE CENTER YES THANK YOU ARE MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS AND- YOU KNOW HOW MUCH I THINK OF YOUR DAUGHTER AS WELL AND I THINK FORMER NEIGHBOR- I DO WANNA GIVE A SHOUT OUT TO MS RIVAS AND MISTER NAZARIAN WHO HAVE ALSO WORKED- OVER THE YEARS ON THIS ISSUE- A FURTHER REASONS- THAT THEY STATED- AND I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE A COMMENT ON ON THE BIG PICTURE TAX INCENTIVE. ISSUE OF THERE'S ONLY THREE THINGS YOU CAN DO TO THE BUCKET YOU CAN PUT MORE IN IT YOU CAN TAKE MORE OUT OF IT OR YOU CAN CREATE A BIGGER BUCKET AND CLEARLY THE INVESTMENTS THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT WE NEED TO DO MORE OF- WHEN WE DO NEED TO HAVE A BIG PICTURE A VIEW OF CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMIC RECOVERY IN CALIFORNIA'S LONG TERM SUCCESS- AND YOU KNOW SIGNED ME UP FOR THOSE CONVERSATIONS AS WELL BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S THAT'S CRITICAL- AND IT'S LONG BEEN A FRUSTRATION. IN THE LEGISLATURE IS THAT THE WAY WE'VE LOOKED AT TAX INCENTIVES WE ALWAYS LOOK AT THEM AS AN EXPENDITURE NOT AS THE INVESTMENT THAT THEY'RE INTENDED TO BE ONE THING WE CAN ALSO LOOK IN IS HOW WE HOW WE BUDGET YOU KNOW CAN WE USE THE PROJECTIVE INCOME. AS A AS A DEDICATED REVENUE STREAM YOU KNOW WE SHOULD LOOK AT THOSE THOSE ISSUES SO I THINK THOSE ARE VERY VERY IMPORTANT POINTS THAT- THE ASSEMBLY MEMBERS MULTIPLE ASSEMBLY MEMBERS HAVE BATES SELF- CERTAINLY WANT TO GIVE THAT CONVERSATION IF IT'S DUE THE OTHER PIECE THAT'S EXCITING ABOUT THE ENTERTAINMENT TAX CREDIT IS THE ACCOUNTABILITY YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TO CREATE THE JOBS YEAH ACTUALLY HAVE TO DO THE WORK OFTENTIMES- IN THE EARLY TWO THOUSANDS BEFORE WE HAD PROP TWENTY FIVE. TAX CREDITS WERE USED AS A VEHICLE TO CLOSE TO GET VOTES TO CLOSE THE BUDGET DISCUSSIONS AND THERE IS VERY LITTLE ACCOUNTABILITY IN THAT THERE WAS VERY LITTLE- FOLLOW UP TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY WERE IN TE JOBS THAT WERE INTENDED TO BE CREATED WERE ACTUALLY CREATED AND THAT GAVE THE TAX INCENTIVES HISTORICALLY A BAD NAME BECAUSE THERE WAS NO ACCOUNTABILITY THIS PARTICULAR TAX CREDIT- FOOT THAT AND BROUGHT THE ACCOUNT ABILITY. THE JUDGE CREATION THE RECORD HAD TO BE THERE IN ORDER FOR THE MONEY TO BE DISHED OUT AND I THINK THAT'S THAT'S AN APPROACH THAT AS WE LOOK AT TAX POLICY WE SHOULD LOOK AT. THAT THAT APPROACH TO MAKING SURE THAT THE JOBS ACTUALLY GET CREATED THE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT- ACTUALLY. ACTUALLY HAPPENS AND SO. I THINK THAT AS IS IMPORTANT AND THAT'S ALSO. ANOTHER PIECE OF WHY THIS IS ALSO. A SIGNIFICANT IS THE SAME COLD FIRM. FOR THE INCENTIVES ON DIVERSITY IN ORDER TO GET THE ACTUAL DOLLARS. YOU HAVE TO HAVE THOSE DIVERSITY PLANTS- AND SO I THINK THAT'S A CRITICAL COMPONENT WHERE THERE'S A IMBEDDED INTO THIS. THE ACCOUNTABILITY THAT ARE. TAXPAYERS WANT. AND THE JOB CREATION AND THE DIVERSITY CREATION THAT THAT. THE SOCIETY AND SOCIOLOGY DEMANDS THAT WE DO- THE LAST THING I WANT TO COVER IS. WE WOULD NOT BE HERE OBVIOUSLY BOTH THE SENATE AND THE ASSEMBLY WORK COLLABORATIVE LEE TOGETHER. BUT THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WERE STRONG SUPPORTERS OF THIS AS WELL. THE GOVERNOR WRECKED RECOGNIZED EARLY ON HOW IMPORTANT THIS INDUSTRY IS TO CALIFORNIA. AND WAS- VERY SUPPORTIVE OF MAKING SURE WE HAD SOMETHING IN PLACE. THAT HAD THE ACCOUNTABILITY AND THAT'S WHERE FINANCED CAME IN AND HAD THE SAFEGUARDS THAT. MR CORK MENTIONED EARLIER- THAT WE DON'T FIND OURSELVES IN OVERPRESCRIBE. SITUATION SO. THE ADMINISTRATION WAS VERY IMPORTANT TO BRING THAT FISCAL. RESTRAINT INTO THE CONVERSATION BUT ON A MACRO SENSE ALSO RECOGNIZED HOW IMPORTANT THIS INDUSTRY IS FOR CALIFORNIA. AND WAS CENTRAL TO THE SUCCESS THAT WE HAVE HERE SO AT A TIME WHEN WE WATCH THE DYSFUNCTION. IN WASHINGTON WE SAW THE TWO HOUSES AND THE ADMINISTRATION WORKED VERY COLLABORATIVE LEE- TO GET US TO THIS POINT AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE SO- WITH THAT I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MISS HOLLY TO CALL THE ROLL PLEASE BURKE HI THE MOTION IS TO PASS BURKE HI. BIRTH BY. WHEN NAZARIAN HI NAZARIAN I GRAYSON. GRAYSON I CARILLO. REAL ALL RIGHT. CALDERON I CALDERON HI MULLIN.
