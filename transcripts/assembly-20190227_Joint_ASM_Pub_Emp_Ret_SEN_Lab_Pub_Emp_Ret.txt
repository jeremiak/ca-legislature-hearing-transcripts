THE OVERVIEW OF CALIFORNIA PUBLIC SECTOR EMPLOYMENT STATE CIVIL SERVICE AND COLLECTIVE BARGAINING. WE HAVE NECK SHOULDER PRINCIPLE FIRST FISCAL AND POLICY ANALYST. LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. SUZANNE AMBROSE EXECUTIVE OFFICER THE STATE PERSONNEL BOARD. AND JOSH SHRUGGED GOAL CAUGHT EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR PUBLIC EMPLOYMENT RELATIONS BOARD. AND JUSTICE THEY WILL HAVE TWENTY MINUTES -- CAN DEPENDING ON HOW YOU PRESENT YOU COULD. DIVVY UP THE TIME AS LONG AS WE COME UP TO TWENTY MINUTES OR LESS. CONSIDER WHAT JEFF SO WITH THAT GO AHEAD AND TEARS. MY NAME'S NICK SCHROEDER AND THE LEGISLATIVE. ANALYST'S OFFICE OF THIS MORNING FIRST RUN GONNA DO IS INTRODUCE OUR OFFICES ROLE MORE BROADLY IN THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS AND THEN TALK SPECIFICALLY ABOUT. COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AND OUR OFFICES ROLE IN THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING PROCESS. SO OUR OFFICE PROVIDE HAS FOR THE PAST SEVENTY FIVE YEARS OR MORE THAN SEVENTY FIVE YEARS PROVIDED NONPARTISAN FISCAL POLICY ANALYSIS TO THE LEGISLATURE. AND IN THAT ROLE WE PROVIDE ANALYSIS AND ADVICE TO MEMBERS OF BOTH PARTIES OF BOTH HOUSES -- AND WE HAVE A NUMBER OF REOCCURRING PRODUCTS THAT I WAS GOING TO HIGHLIGHT JUST -- FOR WE DO OF FISCAL FORECASTS WERE RE LOOK AT THE STATE'S EXPENDITURES AND REVENUES AND WE DO THAT EACH YEAR IN NOVEMBER AND AGAIN IN MAY. AND THEN AFTER THE GOVERNOR INTRODUCES HIS BUDGET IN JANUARY WE THEN DO A SERIES OF REPORTS LOOKING AT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSALS AND ALSO ALTERNATIVES FOR LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER BETWEEN JANUARY. AND WHEN THE LEGISLATURE ULTIMATELY A TOPS -- ITS BUDGET PACKAGE AND IN THE THIRD CATEGORY IS INDEPENDENT REPORTS OR ALSO MEMBER REQUEST IT'S KIND OF ONE CATEGORY WHERE IT'S WE'RE LOOKING AT A SPECIFIC. PROPOSAL OR POLICY AREA. IN MEMBER REQUESTS ARE OFF THE STREETS THESE AS CONFIDENTIAL UNTIL WE'RE TOLD BY THE OFFICE THE LEGISLATIVE OFFICE TO MAKE A PUBLIC -- AND I BROUGHT AN EXAMPLE OF JUST ONE OF OUR SELF GENERATED ONES WERE BASICALLY WE HAVE AN ISSUE THAT WE THINK THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD. BE AWARE OF AND IN THE LAST WORKLOAD -- PRODUCT THAT I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT IS OUR WORK FOR THE VOTER INFORMATION GUIDE WHERE WE DO THE ANALYSIS OF STATEWIDE BALLOT MEASURES. AND SO NOW TURNING -- TO THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING PROCESS. UP PUBLIC EMPLOYEES IN CALIFORNIA THE COLLECTIVE BARGAIN PROCESS BIRD VARIOUS DIFFERENT TYPES OF EMPLOYEES IS ESTABLISHED THROUGH A NUMBER OF STATUTES -- AND I THINK THE PUBLIC EMPLOYMENT RELATIONS BOARD OF PRIVACY ABLE TO SPEAK MORE DIRECTLY TO EACH OF THE STATUTES -- BECAUSE THE EACH PERTAIN TO DIFFERENT TYPES OF EMPLOYEES. BUT I WAS GONNA SPEAK SPECIFICALLY TO THE RALPH C. DEALS ACT BECAUSE IT APPLIES TO STATE EMPLOYEES AND IT'S ALSO THE ROLE THAT OUR OFFICE PLACE IS IN THAT ACT. AND SO UNDER THE ROUSEY DEALS ACT -- COLLECTIVE BARGAINING IS BETWEEN THE GOVERNOR REPRESENTS THE EMPLOYER AND HE'S REPRESENTED BY DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN RESOURCES AT THE BARGAINING TABLE -- AND THEN THE EMPLOYEES ARE ORGANIZED INTO TWENTY ONE BARGAINING UNITS. AND ARE REPRESENTED BY UNIONS AT THE BARGAINING TABLE. SO THE PRODUCT OF THESE NEGOTIATIONS RANDOM OF UNDERSTANDING -- AND YOU. AND BEFORE THE MO YOU GOES INTO PLACE ITS FIRST WE NEED TO BE RATIFIED BY THE UNION MEMBERSHIP AS WELL AS BY THE LEGISLATURE. AND SO THAT REALLY GETS INTO WHERE OUR OFFICE PLAYS A ROLE IS THE LEGISLATURE'S CONSIDERATION OF THAT AND WILL YOU. AND SO SINCE TWO THOUSAND FIVE OUR OFFICE HAS. BEEN REQUIRED TO PREPARE FISCAL ANALYSIS A PROPOSED DEMO USE AND UNDER STATE LAW WE HAVE TEN CALENDAR DAYS. TO TO CONDUCT THIS REVIEW UP BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE THAN CAN CONSIDER -- WHETHER OR NOT TO RATIFY AN AGREEMENT. AND ESSENTIALLY THIS PROCESS WORKS WERE THE DEPARTMENT HUMAN RESOURCES ARE DEPARTMENT FINANCE THEY WORK TOGETHER TO DEVELOP THE COST ESTIMATES AND SUMMARY OF THE AGREEMENTS. ADMINISTRATION AND SUBMITS THEIR SUMMARY THE AGREEMENTS AND THEIR SUMMARY OF THE PHYSICAL FACTS FOR OFFICE AND ONCE WE RECEIVE THOSE DOCUMENTS THE TEN DAY CALENDAR CLOCK BEGINS. AND SINCE TEN DAYS IS IS NOT A WHOLE LOT OF TIME TO REVIEW. PERHAPS MANY AGREEMENTS THAT ONCE THAT ARE SEVERAL HUNDRED PAGES LONG WE REALLY DO -- KIND OF A KICKING OF THE TIRES OF THE MINISTRATIONS OF SUMMARIES AS WELL AS THEIR PHYSICAL FACTS AND SO WE LOOK TO SEE WHETHER THEY INCLUDED -- EVERYTHING THAT WE THINK THEY SHOULD INCLUDE IN TERMS OF SUMMARIZING THE PAN THE AGREEMENT TO THE LEGISLATURE. AND WHETHER THEY ACCURATELY YOU'RE REASONABLY RICH AGREEMENT. AND UNLIKE THE OTHER PRODUCTS THAT I SHOWED EARLIER WHICH ARE NOT PHYSICAL FORM. BECAUSE OF THE TIME CONSTRAINTS WE POSTED ON OUR WEBSITE. PRINTED OUT AN EXAMPLE OF THAT FOR YOU HERE. AND AND THEN THE LAST PART OF OUR RULES PROCESS IS THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS SO EACH YEAR IN JANUARY THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES PROPOSALS RELATED TO AUGMENTING EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION. AND WE MONITOR THOSE PROPOSALS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE CONSISTENT WITH. OF THE MO USER BEEN RATIFIED BY THE LEGISLATURE. UP THAN THAT THAT CONCLUDES MY FORMAL REMARKS. THANK YOU WHO LIKE YOUR NEXT. I'M UP. SUZANNE AMBROSE I'M THE EXECUTIVE OFFICER AT THE STATE PERSONAL BOARD THANK YOU CHAIRS AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT AS PP -- SO S. P. B. WAS CREATED -- THROUGH THE STATE CONSTITUTION ARTICLE SEVEN IN. NINETEEN THIRTY FOUR AND IT WAS IN RESPONSE -- TO YOU KNOW THE MAJORITY OF A STATE JOBS WERE THE RESULT OF POLITICAL PATRONAGE AND SO THE VOTERS. YOU KNOW BROUGHT AN INITIATIVE TO SYSTEM. AND PART OF ARTICLE SEVEN CREATES A FIVE MEMBER. BOARD APPOINTED BY THE GOVERNOR. AND THEY EACH SERVE TEN YEAR TERMS -- STAGGERED EVERY TWO YEARS BUT THEY SERVE UNTIL THEIR REPLACED AND SO SOMETIMES THE BOARD MEMBERS WILL SERVE BEYOND THE TEN YEARS -- AND TELL REPLACEMENT IS NAMED -- CURRENTLY OF ALL OF OUR BOARD MEMBERS WERE APPOINTED BY GOVERNOR BROWN. AND ALL BUT ONE HAVE BEEN CONFIRMED SO THEY HAVE TO BE CONFIRMED BY THE SENATE -- AND BASICALLY ARE FUNCTIONS HAVE CHANGED. OVER THE YEARS SO OVER THE DECADES THERE FAN NUMEROUS ITERATIONS OF THE STATE PERSONNEL BOARD ORIGINALLY STATE PERSONAL BOARD WITH ALL THINGS H. R. -- COMPENSATION YOU KNOW CIVIL SERVICE THE ENTIRE GAMUT -- IN A NINETEEN ABOUT THE EARLY EIGHTIES WHEN COLLECTIVE BARGAINING CAME INTO. YOU KNOW STATE EMPLOYMENT -- THE DEPARTMENT OF PERSONNEL ADMINISTRATION WAS AND MANY OF THE FUNCTIONS THAT S. P. B. DID -- STE PARTICULARLY RELATED TO COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS. TRANSFERRED OVER TO THE DEPARTMENT OF PERSONNEL ADMINISTRATION -- OUR MOST RECENT REORGANIZATION OCCURRED IN. TWENTY TWELVE AND WHAT WE DID AND THAT REORGANIZATION WAS WE TRANSFERRED ALL OF THE HR SORT OF OPERATIONAL FUNCTIONS OF THE STATE CIVIL SERVICE EXAMS THAT TRAINING FUNCTION. THE CIVIL RIGHTS OFFICE -- ALL OF THOSE OPERATIONAL FUNCTIONS WENT OVER TO A NEWLY CREATED DEPARTMENT. DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN RESOURCES -- WE CALLED CALLI CHAR. SO WHAT S. P. B. NOW FOCUSES ON IS WE WE SET ALL THE POLICY RELATED TO THE CIVIL ERVICE SYSTEM -- WE ISSUE ALL THE RULES AND WE BASICALLY TELL THE DEPARTMENTS HOW. TO DO IT -- AND THEN WE AUDIT THEM TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE IN COMPLIANCE. SO WE HAVE AN AUDIT FUNCTION -- WE WE HAVE A POLICY FUNCTION AND THEN THAT'S ON THE SORT OF THE SELECTION SIDE OF AS STATE EMPLOYMENT. AND THEN WE ALSO HAVE THE STILL HAVE THE DISCIPLINE SIDE SO ANY DISCIPLINARY ACTION IS TAKEN AGAINST A CIVIL SERVANT -- HAS THE RIGHT TO APPEAL TO THE STATE PERSONAL BOARD. AND SO WE HAVE WHAT WE CALL MERIT APPEALS THOSE SIR CHALLENGES TO FOR INSTANCE EXAM RESULTS OR IF SOMEONE'S BEEN DISQUALIFIED BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T PASS THE BACKGROUND CHECK -- THEY CAN APPEAL THAT TO US AND THEN OF COURSE DISCIPLINE ONCE YOU ARE A PERMANENT STATE EMPLOYEE -- IF ANY OF YOU KNOW ANY DISCIPLINE IS BEING TAKEN THEN YOU HAVE TO BE SERVED WITH THAT. IN WRITING AND YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO APPEAL THAT TO THE BOARD. SO WE GET WE HAVE ABOUT SIXTY FIVE EMPLOYEES ON A THIRTEEN MILLION DOLLAR BUDGET. AND WE WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH CALLIE CHART. GREAT. THANK YOUR MUCH OF NICOLA MIXED. A GOOD MORNING -- MISTER RODRIGUEZ SENATOR HILL AND STAFF JOSH WILL GO TO A AND THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE PUBLIC EMPLOYMENT RELATIONS BOARD. ALSO KNOWN AS PER. UP HERB IS A QUASI JUDICIAL AGENCY -- CREATED BY THE LEGISLATURE TO OVERSEE PUBLIC SECTOR COLLECTIVE BARGAINING IN CALIFORNIA. THE BOARD ADMINISTERS THE EIGHT COLLECTIVE BARGAINING STATUTES. OF THOSE ARE THE EDUCATIONAL EMPLOYMENT RELATIONS ACT ERA. THE HIGHER EDUCATION EMPLOYER EMPLOYEE RELATIONS ACT HERE A THE STATE EMPLOYER EMPLOYEE RELATIONS ACTS COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS THE BILL'S ACT. THE MYERS MILIUS BROWN ACT.

IN THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL COUNCIL EMPLOYER EMPLOYEE RELATIONS ACT -- DEALING WITH THE NON JUDICIAL EMPLOYEES A IS JUDICIAL COUNCIL A WE ALSO ADMINISTER THE PUBLIC EMPLOYEE COMMUNICATIONS CHAPTER WHICH IS A RECENT -- EFFORT DESIGNED TO PROVIDE EFFECTIVE IN MEANINGFUL WAYS FOR EXCLUSIVE REPRESENTATIVES TO COMMUNICATE WITH THEIR BARGAINING UNITS. NOW PER HAS. THE THE GOAL OF PERMITS TO ENSURE CONSISTENT IMPLEMENTATION APPLICATION OF THOSE. EIGHT STATUTES IN WE JUDICATA LABOR RELATIONS DISPUTES BETWEEN THE PARTIES THAT ARE SUBJECT TO THEM. AND THE DESIGN OF THE STATUE JUST IS TO PROTECT THE EMPLOYEES EMPLOYERS ANY EMPLOYER ORGANIZATIONS FROM UNFAIR PRACTICES WITH PER PROVIDING SETTLEMENT RESOLUTION OF THOSE DISPUTES. THE BOARD ITSELF BY STATUTE IS COMPRISED OF COMPOSED OF UP TO FIVE MEMBERS APPOINTED BY THE GOVERNOR AND SUBJECT TO SENATE CONFIRMATION. CURRENTLY WE HAVE A FOR MEMBERS OF OUR BOARD THREE OF WHOM HAVE BEEN CONFIRMED AND ONE WHO IS AWAITING CONFIRMATION -- WE HAVE ONE VACANCY FOR A TERM THAT ACTUALLY EXPIRES AT THE END OF THIS. CALENDAR YEAR IN CURRENTLY THERE IS NO CHAIR -- FOR OUR BOARD THAT THE SEPARATELY APPOINTED POSITION BY THE GOVERNOR -- TO ONE OF THE FIVE EXISTING OF MEMBERS -- IN ADDITION TO THE OVERALL RESPONSIBILITY OF ADMINISTERING THOSE STATUTORY SCHEME TO THE BOARD ACCESS AN APPELLATE BODY. TO DECIDE ISSUES TO CHALLENGES -- FROM -- DECISIONS OF THOSE BOARD THE BOARD ITSELF MAY ALSO BE APPEALED. IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES TO THE STATE APPELLATE AND SUPERIOR COURTS -- JUST TO GIVE SOME HIGHLIGHTS OF SOME OF OUR MAJOR FUNCTIONS. OF THE MAJOR FUNCTIONS OF HERBERT BOTHERED THE INVESTIGATION AND ADJUDICATION OF UNFAIR PRACTICE CHARGES ALL GO INTO A LITTLE BIT OF DETAIL WHAT THAT MEANS. A IN A MOMENT OF THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE RABBIT REPRESENTATION PROCESS SO -- THAT'S THE PROCESS BY WHICH PUBLIC EMPLOYEES SELECT AN EMPLOYEE ORGANIZATION TO READ REPRESENT THEM IN THEIR LABOR RELATIONS AT THE CUT USED TO DO SO -- AS I MENTIONED EDUCATION OF APPEALS OF ORIGIN TERMINATIONS -- OUR OFFICE OF GENERAL COUNSEL ALSO -- HAS SOME LEGAL FUNCTIONS THAT THEY PERFORM IN ADDITION TO THE ONES THAT HAVE BEEN MENTIONED. AND THEN AS OF TWENTY TWELVE THE STATE MEDIATION AND CONCILIATION SERVICE IS NOW A PART OF PER -- AND THEY PROVIDE MEDIATION SERVICES TO MOSTLY PUBLIC AND OCCASIONALLY SOME PRIVATE CONSTITUENTS -- GOING BACK TO OF THE UNFAIR PRACTICE CHARGES -- FROM. IN EXAMPLES OF THESE -- INCLUDE THINGS ON THE EMPLOYER SIDE -- SUCH IS REFUSING TO NEGOTIATE IN GOOD FAITH WITH AN EMPLOYER ORGANIZATION DISCIPLINING ARE THREATENING EMPLOYEES FOR PARTICIPATING IN UNION ACTIVITIES OR PROMISING BENEFITS OF AN EMPLOYEE DOESN'T PARTICIPATE. IN UNION ACTIVITIES -- AND THEN THE EXAMPLES ON UNLAWFUL ASIAN CONDUCT INCLUDE THREATENING EMPLOYEES IF THEY REFUSED TO JOIN THE UNION -- DISCIPLINING A MEMBER FOR FILING AND FOR PRACTICE CHARGE AGAINST THE UNION. OR FAILING TO REPRESENT -- BARGAINING IN UNIT MEMBERS FAIRLY -- AS PART OF THE EMPLOYMENT RELATIONSHIP WITH THEIR EMPLOYERS -- QUICKLY I'LL JUST TOUCH ON SOME OF THE LEGAL OTHER LEGAL FUNCTIONS OF OUR GENERAL COUNSEL'S OFFICE. THIS COULD INCLUDE THINGS LIKE DEFENDING FINAL BOARD DECISIONS ARE ORDERS -- WHEN PARTY SEEK REVIEW IN STATE APPELLATE COURTS -- SEEKING ENFORCEMENT WHEN A PARTY REFUSES TO COMPLY WITH THE FINAL BOARD DECISIONS OF EITHER OF THE PARTIES DECIDES THEY'RE NOT GONNA FOLLOW WITH THE BOARD DECISION IS -- OUR OFFICE OF GENERAL COUNSEL CAN SEEK INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AGAINST THOSE -- PARTIES -- DEFENDING THE BOARDAGAINST ATTEMPTS TO STATES ACTIVITIES OF THE BORDERS IN THE DECISION MAKING PROCESS -- AND SOMEONE TRIES TO ENJOY THOSE ACTIVITIES OF THE OFFICE OF GENERAL COUNSEL WOULD DEFEND THEM. AND IN GENERAL JUST DEFENDING THE JURISDICTION OF THE BOWL. IN CASES WHERE THE BOARD HAS A SPECIAL INTERESTS SO IT MIGHT NOT BE A PARTY BUT IS INTERESTED IN THE OUTCOME. OF IT -- I MENTION THE STATE MEDIATION AND CONCILIATION SERVICE AS A SEPARATE ENTITY OF WITHIN PER -- THEIR ROLE IS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT I JUST WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THEIR MEDIATION AND REPRESENTATION SERVICES. SHOULDN'T BE CONFUSED WITH THE ROLE OF HERB ON THE OFFICE OF GENERAL COUNSEL OF THE STATE MEDIATION CONCILIATION SERVICES WORK IS PERFORMED ON THE BASIS OF MUTUAL CONSENT SO THAT'S BOTH PARTIES COMING TOGETHER DECIDING THAT THEY WOULD LIKE TO TRY TO MEDIATE AN ISSUE -- INSIDE EXCEPT IN CASES WHERE IT'S REQUIRED BY A A CERTAIN STATUTE. AND THESE MEDIATIONS ARE NON DID YOU TO COURT NON ADJUDICATORY UNLIKE A PURPOSE OTHER -- ACTIVITIES WITH AND REALLY AN EMPHASIS ON COMPROMISE ON IN COLLABORATION TOWARD SETTLEMENT. I WITH THAT I THINK I'LL LEAVE IT THERE AND SEE IF YOU ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU JOSH I WITH THAT OPEN UP TO ANY COLLEGE LIKE TO HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. WHEN QUESTIONS CENTER RECORDED THANK YOU YOU ALL GOT WHAT TERM? WOULD OF THE CASES THAT MAKE UP A MAJORITY OF THE HEARINGS THAT YOU HAVE IS TRYING TO GET A SENSE OF MOST OF THE MOST OF THE ISSUES THAT. OPERAS OFFICE OF GENERAL COUNSEL STARTS WITH THEIR THE ON FOR PRACTICE CHARGES SO THOSE LIST OF ACTIVITIES BY EMPLOYERS EMPLOYER IN HIS ASIANS THAT ARE UNLAWFUL -- AND COMPLAINTS THAT ARE FILED WITH 70% OF OUR OFFICE THE GENERAL COUNSEL'S WORKLOAD -- STARTS THERE -- BRING THAT DOWN A LITTLE FURTHER MOST OF OUR WORK COMES FROM EITHER THE EDUCATIONAL EMPLOYMENT RELATIONS ACT OR THE MYERS MILIUS BROWN ACT I WOULD SAY. THOSE TWO ACTS CREATE MOST OF PROBES WORKLOAD [inaudible] THANK YOU. THANK YOU CENTER ANYONE ELSE CENTER HIM. THANK THANK YOU ALL FOR BEING HERE AND I REALIZE THAT THE I THINK THE MAIN FOCUS OF YOUR TESTIMONY IS REGARD TO I THINK THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING PROCESS AND ALSO -- THE THE FUNCTIONS OF YOUR ORGANIZATIONS AND I KNOW CAL H. R. ISN'T HERE -- BUT I I DID MINE JUST ASK A BRIEF QUESTION TO KLAY OF THE STATE PERSONNEL BOARD AGAIN A REALIZE THIS PIPE MORE DEVOLVED TO COLLEGE ARE -- A MILL MY OFFICE WERE CLOSE OF COLLEGE ARE TO AND TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE INCREASE THE DIVERSITY OF OUR STATE WORK FORCE -- SO AND IF YOU RUSSIAN SUE THE STATE PERSONNEL BOARD. AND YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH CALLIE CHAR AND AND AND AND HOW AND AND SO. IT AND SOME OF THE THINGS THAT ARE YOU THINK THAT WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO DO. TO INCREASE. THE DIVERSITY OF OUR STATE WORKFORCE AND ALSO TO MAKE A STATE JOBS MORE AVAILABLE TO A BROADER SEGMENT OF FAR AS OUR OUR COMMUNITY SHARE -- SO THE OFFICE OF CIVIL RIGHTS USED TO BE WITH THE STATE PERSONAL BOARD AND THEN IN TWENTY TWELVE I GOT TRANSFERRED OVER TO CALAIS CHAR SO -- YOU KNOW WE WORK VERY CLOSELY TOGETHER ON THOSE ISSUES WE HAVE A NUMBER OF SORT OF TASKFORCE COMMITTEES THAT WE COLLABORATE WITH FOR INSTANCE DEPARTMENT OF REHABILITATION TO INCREASE EMPLOYMENT OF PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES -- AND YOU KNOW IT IT'S REALLY MULTI FACETED IT'S YOU KNOW RECRUITMENT IT'S OUR REACH.

WITH CAL HR TO TRY TO DO SOME EDUCATIONAL SESSIONS AND AND THE DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE COMMUNITY ACTUALLY INTERESTING ENOUGH WE FOUND OUT THERE ARE PRIVATE VENDORS DOING THAT AS WELL YES -- BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT STATE ITSELF PARTICULARLY SENT. GOING OUT INTO YOUNG STATE TO GIVE THEM THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THEM TO APPLY FOR STATE JOBS. BECAUSE IT'S NOT A CERTAIN LACK OF ABILITY MAYBE LACK OF UNDERSTAND KNOWLEDGE OF THE STATE HIRING PROCESS WHICH IS SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT FOR FOR LOTS OF RAIN POURED REASONS.

THINGS WERE MUCH. MORE PRESS HUESO OF CALIFORNIA SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS AT THANK YOU FOR HAVING THE SCHOOLS VOICE IN THIS CONVERSATION. ON ACCESS A IS ONE IS A UNIQUE ORGANIZATION COMPARED TO OTHER ADMINISTRATOR ASSOCIATIONS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. MOST OTHER STATES HAVE LIKE A SUPERINTENDENT ASSOCIATION OR PRINCIPLE ASSOCIATION ACTS THE HOUSE ALL ADMINISTRATORS UNDER ONE UMBRELLA SO WE ARE IN FACT LARGER THAN OUR NATIONAL FEEL YET BECAUSE WE CALIFORNIA WE HAVE MORE MEMBERS -- AND SO WE AT BECAUSE OF THAT IT PROVIDES US AND I THINK IN AUTUMN A WONDERFUL OPPORTUNITY TO BE ABLE TO HEAR ALL THE VOICES IN ORDER FOR US -- TO INFLUENCE THE LEGISLATURE IN BEATING -- WE HAVE TWENTY THREE WHAT WE CALL JOB ALIKE COMMITTEES AND COUNCILS DOUBLE LIKE SERVERS ARE YOUR SUPERINTENDENTS YOUR ELEMENTARY PRINCIPALS MIDDLE SCHOOL PRINCIPALS HIGH SCHOOL PRINCIPALS. I WORK WITH OUR HUMAN RESOURCE ADMINISTRATORS VERY CLOSELY -- AND SO WE HAVE TWENTY THREE EIGHT OF THOSE WE REPRESENT BUT CLASSIFIED AND CERTIFICATED -- ADMINISTRATORS AND THAT MEANS ALL THE WAY FROM THE SUPERINTENDENT'S ASSISTANT ALL THE WAY UP TO THE SUPERINTENDENT EVERYBODY IN BETWEEN. WE'RE NOT A UNION WERE MEMBERSHIP ORGANIZATION SO PEOPLE CHOOSE TO BELONG TO ACCESS SO WE EVERY YEAR WE GO THROUGH THE MEMBERSHIP DRIVE IT SUB CHALLENGING BUT WE WE HAVE ABOUT EIGHTEEN THOUSAND MEMBERS AT ABOUT THE TWENTY THREE OF THOUSAND OR SO ADMINISTRATORS IN THE STATE -- WE ALSO AND WE DIVIDE WE HAVE FOR ADVOCATES AND WE DIVIDE THE ISSUES MUCH LIKE THE LEAGUE DOES BETWEEN ISSUE AREAS OF COURSE -- YOU KNOW WE DO A LOT IN EDUCATION SPACE OUT BUT I HAVE THE PRIVILEGE OF WORKING IN THE LABOR SPACE AND SO -- IT'S NOT ALWAYS AN EASY -- YOU KNOW JOB TO HAVE BECAUSE WE'RE IN THE POSITION OF HAVING TO BALANCE WHAT WE WANT TO DO FOR EMPLOYEES AND MAKING SURE THAT OUR EMPLOYEES ARE TAKEN CARE OF BUT ALSO ENSURING THAT OUR STUDENTS ARE BEING SERVED SO WE HAVE SORT OF I THINK. A UNIQUE -- PUBLIC EMPLOYER EMPLOYER PERSPECTIVE ALSO CONSIDERED AN AGENT OF THE STATE OR LOCAL GOVERNMENT WERE SPECIAL DISTRICT OR SCHOOL DISTRICTS SO WHENEVER THERE'S LEGISLATION GOING THROUGH WE'RE RIGHT WE'RE HAVING TO KEEP A PRETTY VIGILANT ALLY. ON THE IMPACT BECAUSE OFTENTIMES WE FIND OURSELVES. WITH UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES THAT WERE SUBSUMED INTO LEGISLATION WHEN WE WEREN'T SUPPOSED TO BE THERE. 8290% OF OUR BUDGET GOES TO EMPLOYEES AND SO THAT DOESN'T LEAVE A LOT FOR ON THE OTHER ADDITION SAME PLACE BUT FOR PEOPLE WHERE PEOPLE HEAVY INDUSTRY AND WE HAVE TEACHERS ADMINISTRATORS CLASSIFIED -- AN OTHERS AND SO THAT'S WHERE THE MAJORITY OF OUR OF OUR BUDGET GOES -- WE ALSO LIKE THE LEAGUE HAVE -- HAVE ARE DIFFERENT CAUCUSES WE ALSO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE TRIED TO IMPRESS UPON MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE AND HIS STAFF THAT. OUR MEMBERS ARE AT THEIR TO ADD A COMPUTER SOMETIME DURING THE DAY I MEAN MAYBE ELEVEN O'CLOCK AT NIGHT BUT THEY'RE GOING TO BE THERE. SO WE HAVE AN ABILITY THAT IF YOU HAVE EVER HAVE A QUESTION A WHAT A POLICY POSITIONS GOING TO BE WHAT IT COULD LOOK LIKE AND WHAT MIGHT IMPACT BEYOND JUST YOUR DISTRICT. WE HAVE THAT A BILL AVAILABILITY WE OFFER IT FREELY TO ANYBODY WHO WANTS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT THAT -- YOU'LL GET A GOOD PERSPECTIVE IT'S NOT GONNA BE A 100% BUT YOU CAN GET A GOOD FEELING OF WHAT THE IMPACT WOULD BE THROUGHOUT THE STATE. WE HAVE NINETEEN REGIONS -- DIVIDED UP -- YOU KNOW STATE WIDE SO THOSE OF YOU I'M SURE I'VE HEARD FROM YOUR LOCAL -- SUPERINTENDENTS OUR PRINCIPLES ARE OTHERS TING TO ISSUES THAT ARE GOING ON IN THERE ON IN THEIR DISTRICTS. ONE OF THE OTHER THINGS THAT'S DIFFERENT THAT'S CHALLENGING FOR I THINK ON SCHOOL DISTRICTS AS A PUBLIC EMPLOYER IS THAT WE ARE AND I SAY THIS WITH ALL -- ADDED DECORUM I GUESS I WOULD SAY THAT EVERY BUT I I'VE SAID THIS FOR YEARS THAT I THINK EVERYBODY THINKS ARE AN EXPERT IN EDUCATION BECAUSE EVERYBODY WENT TO SCHOOL -- OR YOU HAVE KIDS OR GRANDCHILDREN WHO WENT TO SCHOOL AND SO WE WE TEND TO DEAL WITH A LOT OF ISSUES THAT. I'M YOU KNOW REPRESENTING OUR ADMINISTRATORS THAT MAYBE WE THINK WE THINK THEY'RE A GOOD IDEA BUT ARE THEY REALLY BASED IN FACT AND AND POLICY THAT WILL IMPLEMENT AND BE IT CAN BE IMPLEMENTED IN THE LOCAL. CONTACTS SO I WORK VERY CLOSELY AGAIN AS I MENTIONED WITH OUR OUR HUMAN RESOURCE ADMINISTRATORS -- GUIDING ME AS WE MOVE THROUGH TO TAKE POSITIONS ON LEGISLATION ONE OF THE THINGS I DID WANT TO BACK TRACK A LITTLE BIT ON AND HOW WE TAKE POSITIONS ON LEGISLATION. WE HAVE OF LEGISLATIVE POLICY COMMITTEE MADE UP OF PEOPLE FROM EVERY ONE OF OUR JOB A LIKE. A COMMITTEES AND COUNCILS AND THEN REGIONAL REPRESENTATION SO WHEN WE TAKE A POSITION WE HAVE SOME EXPERTS IN THE ROOM TO A BE ABLE TO HELP INFLUENCE WHAT WE'RE DOING I THINK THAT IT DOES SPACE OF OF HUMAN RESOURCES IS SO LEGAL AND SO TECHNICAL THAT I COULDN'T DO. MY JOB WITHOUT THE HELP OF OUR MEMBERS A BE ABLE TO GUIDE US AS WE MOVED -- MOVE FORWARD SO -- AND THEY FINALLY JUST WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW THAT I'M AS FAR AS A LOT OF OUR PRIORITIES FOR THE YEAR GOING FORWARD -- WE ARE -- IN THE ISSUES OF THE OF THE COOPER V. OF THIS COMMITTEE OBVIOUSLY THE PERSON STARS PENSION PRESSURES CONTINUE TO MOUNT FOR US -- AND WE'RE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT WHEN WE LOOK AT IMPLICATIONS FOR MAKING IS THE BILL ABILITY FARM IN ARM AND EMPLOYEES TO BE ABLE. TO DO THE REPRESENTATION WITH THEIR UNIONS BUT THAT IMPACT IS AT THE SCHOOL AND HOW WE HAVE TO BALANCE THE THE FACT THAT ARE WE NEED PEOPLE IN THE CLASSROOMS AND OF THE SITE'S VERSUS BEING ALSO. MAKING SURE THAT OUR UNION REPRESENTATIVES ARE ABLE TO DO THEIR JOBS AS WELL SO IT'S ALWAYS A KIND OF DELICATE BALANCE THAT WE WE HAVE TO WALK. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ARE WITHOUT ANY COMMENT SIR FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS [inaudible] CENTER TAMPA. HI SOON SO IF CAL HR HERO SAYS A SIMILAR QUESTION ASKED THE PERSONNEL BOARD TERMS OF AND AGAIN I THINK THE PASSWORD KELLY CHORES DONE. WITH CIVIL RIGHTS BOARD BUT IN TERMS OF TRYING TO INCREASE THE DIVERSITY OF OUR LAST STATE WORKFORCE. SOME OF THE WORKS THAT -- YOU'D SEE DOING A DEGREE IN EDUCATING PEOPLE ABOUT HOW THEY CAN ENTER STATES SERVICE -- PEOPLE WHO ARE LIVING AND MORE PERHAPS THIS EVENTUALLY COMMITTEES MUSICAL WHICH MAY NOT BE AS FAMILIAR WITH THE PROCESS WHICH IS A BIT DIFFERENT THAN. THE END. LIMóN OUT IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR AT TIMES RIGHT WHEN HE DID THINGS THAT WE'RE CURRENTLY DOING EXACTLY RE BRANDING HOW TO GET A STATE JOB. SO I KNOW YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH OUR STATE BY RECRUITER BRANDED LETTER JOT HE'S WORKED WITH YOUR OFFICE AS WELL AS ASSEMBLY MEMBERS COOPERS. AND HE IS. ACTUALLY RE BRANDING AND WE'RE LOOKING TO ROLL OUT -- GET THAT MESSAGE OUT WE ALSO WILL BE OPENING UP CAL H. R. FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS OF THE MONTH INVITING THE PUBLIC IN. SO WE CAN COMMUNICATE ON HOW TO GET A STATE JOB -- AS SUSIE AND ROSE TO MENTION YOU ARE MAKING BETTER TOOLS WE HAVE THE CAL CAREERS TO ALLOW THEIR DATES MAKE IT MORE EASIER FOR PEOPLE TO NAVIGATE SO THAT ACTUALLY IS GONNA. HELP WE'VE GOTTEN A LOT OF POSITIVE FEEDBACK FROM THE PUBLIC -- ONE THAT TOOL AND SOLD BUT THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING CURRENTLY [inaudible] MMHM. ANY OTHER IT THE QUESTION IF I COULD WHICH CENTER GOING THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- YOU KNOW DEAN THE UP HOWEVER THE CITY'S WORKING AND I KNOW YOU GAVE THAT GREAT EXAMPLE OF WHAT. SAN MATEO COUNTY DID IN THE THREE CITIES THAT ARE INVOLVED IN THAT GPA. BUT WHAT HOW ARE THE CITY'S WORKING WITH THE PERS TAKE TO KEEP BENEFIT COSTS. YOU KNOW IN A COST TO THIS TO THE CITIES IN THE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS LOW I MEAN ARE THEY WELL LOW AS WELL AS THE LOWER ISN'T YEAH YEAH I I'VE MET MANAGING I THINK WOULD BE THE BETTER THE BETTER TERM -- YOU KNOW IT IT IT STARTS WITH EDUCATION AND I'LL BE THE FIRST TO TELL YOU THAT OVER THE PAST TWENTY YEARS EMPLOYERS ARE ABSENT FROM THE PER FOR THE PURSE BOARD WE WE WE WEREN'T THERE. AND REALLY IN THE LAST THREE YEARS QUITE APPARENT THAT -- AS EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTIONS CONTINUE TO RISE -- IT'S SQUEEZING OUT ESSENTIAL SERVICES AND SO WHEN YOU FOR EXAMPLE WHEN YOU LOOK AT BE OFF BY FISCAL YEAR TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE YOU'RE LOOKING AT ABOUT 10% 212% OF CITY SPENDING GENERAL FUND BUDGET. SPECIFICALLY ON THE MINIMUM PAYMENT ON THE PER SIDE ALONE AND THAT DOES I MEAN THERE'S THERE'S THE LOCALLY WE WORK WITH ARE THE LABOR UNIONS TAT TAT TO PAY SOME OF THAT PLAYER SHARE SO I CERTAINLY WANT TO GIVE CREDIT% WHERE CREDITS DUE -- BUT IT'S ABOUT EDUCATING THAT THAT THE CALPERS BOARD AND LETTING THEM KNOW THAT -- THE ACTIONS THAT THEY THAT THEY TAKE -- CERTAINLY FALLS ON ON THE THE THE BACK OF THE EMPLOYER IF THEY FALL SHORT THEIR BASS RETURNS AND THINGS LIKE THAT SO THE JOKE AROUND CALPERS IS THAT IF I'M YOU KNOW IF I'M NOT HERE WORKING WITH YOU GUYS I'VE GOT A BASICALLY AN OFFICE OVER THERE SO IT'S IT'S IT'S CONCERT. EDUCATION -- WORKING WITH THEM THERE'S BEEN SOME AB TO WEAR PROVIDES NEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR US TO ENGAGE -- BUT WE CERTAINLY -- ARE ACTIVE VOICES IS PARTICULARLY IN THE LAST EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY FOUR MONTHS. REALLY THANK YOU AND IN KNOWING THE WORK THAT WE DO IN IN THE LEGISLATURE IN IN THESE COMMITTEES WHAT -- THE ISSUES THAT COME BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE IS WHAT WHAT DO YOU THINK ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS WE SHOULD BE LOOKING FOR OR AT THIS YEAR WELL. I THINK THAT YOU KNOW THEY'RE THEY'RE ALREADY OF YOU KNOW AND I I WON'T SPEAK OF SPECIFIC MEASURES AT IT IN THIS FORUM BUT I THINK ONE OF THE BIGGEST ISSUES THAT. WE FACE IS -- ON THE DIVESTMENT ISSUE -- I KNOW THAT THERE IS A ROBUST CONVERSATION A COUPLE WEEKS AGO -- THE CITY FROM THE CITY'S PERSPECTIVE -- IT IS SOMETHING THAT QUITE FRANKLY YOU KNOW WHEN YOU PICK WE KNOW WINNERS LOSERS WHAT WHAT SOCIAL BECAUSE THERE IS TO TO TO GET BEHIND -- IT'S A CHALLENGE -- BECAUSE REALLY DIVESTMENT DOESN'T WORK AND RIGHT NOW WHEN YOU HAVE A WHEN YOU HAVE A CALPERS FIND THAT RIGHT NOW IS ABOUT PROXIMALLY 6667% FUNDED MEANING SIXTY SEVEN CENTS FOR EVERY DOLLAR THAT'S TO THOSE EMPLOYEES RETIREES THE TABLE AND NOT NOT ALLOWING THOSE INVESTMENT -- THAT DIDN'T DO VERY VERY CAPABLE INVESTMENT TEAM TO MAXIMIZE THOSE THOSE PROFITS. FOR FOR THOSE PUBLIC EMPLOYEES THAT REALLY IS COMPARABLE TO THE BIGGER ISSUES THAT CAN BE COMING UP THIS YEAR -- I THINK AS YOU SEE SOME OF THE BILL THE LARGER COURT CASES LOOMING -- WITH THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT -- THERE MAY BE A SOME SOME MOTIVATION TO WORK COLLABORATIVELY COLLABORATIVE LEE TO ME TO CODIFY SOME OF THOSE DECISIONS THAT NEED MAYBE COMING OUT AND AND YOU KNOW FIRST AND FOREMOST I THINK THE LEAGUE. WOULD VERY MUCH LIKE TO BE A WILLING PARTNER -- IN WORKING WITH LABOR IN WORKING WITH THIS COMMITTEE -- IT TO TRY TO FIND SOME SOME -- SOME COMPREHENSIVE SOLUTIONS TO PERHAPS CODIFY SOME THIS COURT CASES REVIEW THANK YOU IN THE SAME QUESTION TO THE PANELISTS IN TERMS OF WHAT ISSUES. YOU THINK WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT HERE THAT WOULD GEN. IN WHATEVER IMPORTANT. IT'S A GREAT QUESTION. BUT WE ALSO HAVE STIRS IN ADDITION TO YOU KNOW PER SO -- AS FAR AS THE RETIREMENT ISSUES GO WE'D GET IN JUST NEED HELP IN BEING ABLE TO MEET OUR OBLIGATIONS AS WHAT TING SAID IN ONE OF THE OTHER THINGS WE TEND TO SEE -- THERE TENDS TO BE LEGISLATION THAT MOVES THROUGH THAT PENALIZES THE EMPLOYER WHEN THERE'S DIFFERENT EVENING BUT WHATEVER ISSUE AND SO MAYBE KEEPING IN MIND OF WHAT THAT IMPACT WOULD BE ON THE EMPLOYER BECAUSE IT'S NOT. THE INDIVIDUAL THAT'S BEEN HEARD IT'S THE SYSTEM ITSELF SO THAT WE CAN AND I WOULD AGREE WITH BOTH OF THESE PANELISTS THAT THE WHAT IS THE ISSUE WE NEED TO BE. THANK YOU APPRECIATE SENATOR PAT. THANK YOU IDEA SHOULD OFF OFF AND A COUPLE OF THE QUESTIONS FROM CENTER HELLO -- SO FIRST OF ALL -- A. L. DIVESTMENT INITIATIVES COME UP BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE SINCE I PREVIOUSLY CHAIRED THE PUBLIC EMPLOYMENT THAT TIME BETWEEN NOW THE TWO TOGETHER BUT SO THAT THEY MIGHT HEARING THAT. THE EMPLOYERS WILL BE PERHAPS -- STANDING UP AND TESTIFYING MAURER AT REGARDING DIVESTMENT. ABSOLUTELY I THINK I MEAN DID THE LEAGUE OF CITIES -- AT LEAST AGAIN OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS HAS BEEN VERY STRONG IDEA ABOUT SOME MEASURES I'M AT BEST MAN I THINK WHEN YOU GET TO THE BUSINESS OF PICKING AND CHOOSING YOU JUST HAVE TO HAVE A SOLID LINE -- WITH REGARD SAID TODAY BEST RIGHT NOW THE FUNDS INTO CRITICAL THE PLACE TO BE TAKING TOOLS OFF THE TABLE. OKAY -- AND THEN I GUESS THE OTHER THING I JUST WANNA MAKE NOTE AND I APPRECIATE THAT -- WE'VE BEEN HEARING FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENTS SCHOOL DISTRICTS ABOUT -- PENSION PRESSURES -- BUT I WOULD ALSO MAKE NOTE THAT FOR EXAMPLE DRAIN RECESSION AND SOME OF THE CITIES THAT -- THE LOCALITIES I WORKED WITH YOU KNOW THE WORKERS ACTUALLY AT THE BARGAINING TABLE GAVE UP OUR SAID THEY WEREN'T GOING TO TAKE -- SALARY INCREASES BUT AN ORDER PROTECTOR PENSIONS. AND SO -- BECAUSE OUR FUTURE PAYMENTS. SOMETIMES IT'S EASY TO PICK ON THEM AT BECAUSE YOU HAVEN'T HAD THE CANDY CASH OUT YET -- BUT I I I I THINK WE JUST NEED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT. AND THAT PERHAPS YOU KNOW IF IF THERE'S AN ISSUE ABOUT. THEY ARE PENSION FUNDS NOT PROVIDING ACTOR ENOUGH INFORMATION. TO TWO TWO I GUESS. THE LOCAL ENTITIES OR TO THE UNIONS ABOUT WHAT THE COST MIGHT BE IN THE FUTURE MAYBE WE SHOULD FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO THAT BUT ONCE YOU MADE AN AGREEMENT. I THINK IT'S I I MEAN I THINK WE HAVE YOU A CAUTIOUS ABOUT SAYING THAT WELL NOW THAT WE'RE YOU KNOW WE'RE FEELING PRESSURE FROM AN AGREEMENT WE AGREE TO AND AND NOW WE WATCH I ROLL SOMETHING BACKS I KNOW THAT'S NOT WHAT EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE SAYING BUT THAT. SOMETIMES HEARD THAT USES AN ARGUMENT TO SAY WHAT MADE IN THE PAST YEAH I I CERTAINLY TEACHER I CERTAINLY WILL -- AND WE DID NOT WANT TO COME OFF AS A THAT WE WANT TO ROLL ANYTHING BACK -- IN FACT IT WAIT WITH REGARDS TO TO TO CONTRIBUTIONS I I'D GET A DAY PRINT THE EMPLOYEES OF THE AT THE TO NEGOTIATE TO PAY PART OF THE EMPLOYER PLAYER THE OUT PERSPECTIVE SO. COMPLETELY GET UNDERSTAND YOU'RE SAYING WHAT I ALSO THINK I WENT OUT AND IT AND IT'S JUST THE FACT OF THE OF THE TEACHERS ARE MEMBERS BIG -- THEIR EMPLOYER BUT THEY'RE ALSO AN EMPLOYEE SO THEY DON'T WANT TO SEE THOSE BENEFITS ROLL BACK EITHER I MEAN IT'S KIND OF JUST THE NATURE OF THE BEAST AND SO I DON'T KNOW IN THE SCHOOL SPACE THAT WE SEE IN ANY OF THOSE ROLL BACKS. I HAVE NOT HEARD OF THAT AT ALL. ASSEMBLYMEMBER COOLEY HAD QUESTION. I APPRECIATE THIS CONVERSATION I THINK WE ARE AT A VERY CRITICAL TIME WITH THE SPECTER THE PENSION SYSTEMS. I THINK WE IN THE LEGISLATURE NEED TO BE FOCUSING UPON REALLY. WHAT'S GOING ON IS BROAD FIELD AND HOW WE STE TACKLE IT SYSTEMATICALLY. I LOOK AT IT THROUGH THE LENS YOU KNOW WE HAVE IN THE GOVERNMENT CODE AT SECTION TEN SIX HUNDRED AT SAC. PROVISION FOR A JOINT COMMITTEE RELATED PENSIONS. IT'S EXISTING AUTHORITIES BEEN THERE SINCE THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES. IT ACTUALLY. CONCEDE OF A LIBERAL JOINT COMMITTEE [inaudible] AND IT. AS CONCEPTUALIZE BACK IN THE EIGHTIES IT ENVISIONED. A WIDE ARRAY OF OUR STANDING COMMITTEES EACH FINALLY IN A SUBJECT MATTER EXPERT INTO THIS JOINT COMMITTEE. YET CONTEMPLATED A ADVISORY PANEL OF THE TREASURE ANOTHER'S. AN ADVISORY PANEL FINANCIAL EXPERTS SO THE TOP. A LAWYER WHO PRACTICES THE PENSION FIELD A TOP INVESTMENT ADVISER AN ACTUARIAL RESOURCE. SORT OF TOP TIER PEOPLE IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR IN WITH EXPERTISE INVESTMENT THIS WHOLE RAVE ISSUES. TO THEM LET THE LEGISLATURE. START TO WRANGLE WITH THESE ISSUES [inaudible] ON TO ME HE I AM VERY CONCERNED BECAUSE WHEN I LOOK AT OUR ECONOMY. TWO THIRDS OF OF THE GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT ARISES FROM INDIVIDUAL CONSUMER SPENDING. SO WE ACTUALLY IF WE'RE GONNA. LOOK AT HOW WE KEEP PEOPLE WHO'VE BEEN IN THE WORKFORCE AND THEN EXIT. IN A POSITION SO THAT IN RETIREMENT THEY CAN CONTINUE TO SPEND. AND SUPPORT OUR ECONOMY ACTUALLY GOES VERY IMPORTANT. THAT'S MUCH BIGGER THAN THE BENEFACTION OF SOMEBODY. HAVING TO ROUTE A PENSION. BECAUSE IT IS A PUBLIC GOOD. DOLLARS PEOPLE HAVEN'T JUST BEEN RETIREMENT HELP US PULL THE ECONOMY OUT WE HAVE SEEN SINCE THE EIGHTIES A MOVEMENT TO FOR ONE CASE. WHICH TYPICALLY PEOPLE WE KNOW AND THIS THE ELECTORAL COMINTERN THIS GOING BACK THE NINETIES IS PEOPLE DON'T KNOW HOW TO INVEST. PEOPLE GET IN THEIR ORGANIZATIONS PUBLIC AND PRIVATE WITH FOUR ONE CASE THEY'RE DOING FINE WHEN THE ECONOMY'S ROCKETING ALONG. WHEN THE ECONOMY TANKS THEY SEE THEIR ASSET SHRANK? THEY'RE SCARED TO DEATH TO RETIRE. BECAUSE THEY DO NOT HAVE ENSURE SOURCES BEEN RETIREMENT. WHICH MEANS A CLING TO THESE JOBS. BECAUSE THEY CLAIM THESE JOBS ONLY WAY ORGANIZATION PROPER PRIVATE CAN SKINNY DOWN. IS A LOT OF BLOOD IN THE AISLES ORGANIZATIONS SPEAKING. THIS THE FIRST YEAR BUILD A CLEAN OUT THE SENIOR RANKS OF PEOPLE AND OPEN UP NEW JOBS FOR OUR NEW COLLEGE GRADUATES. AND I PERSONALLY THINK THAT THE REASONS SOME IS MOST FOR MORE RESOURCE SESSIONS HAVE BEEN SOLD LINGERING. IS BECAUSE OF THE COLLAPSE IN SPENDABLE MONEY FOR PEOPLE IN RETIREMENT. TO HELP US PULL OURSELVES OUT. SO I THINK THIS FUNDAMENTAL ISSUE OF THE MODEL YEAR HER IN WE DESCRIBE IS THE INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE DISFAVORED IN THIS. CLIMATE CHANGE YOUR FOR MANY REASONS. IS BUILT AROUND A FLY WHEEL. AND THE WHOLE POINT OF THE FLY WHEEL IS THE PISTONS BOUNCING BACK AND FORTH IN THAT BLOCK. WHICH TO CREATE A HECK OF LOT OF VIBRATION IF YOU'RE IN THAT CAR. THAT BY BRIDGE GETS MOVED OUT BECAUSE IT GETS TRANSLATED TO SMOOTHLY SPENDING. FLY WHEEL INSIDE THE BLOCK THAT SORT OF TAKES THE VIBRATION NOW. AND I THINK WE NEED TO BE A CERTI. THAT THE FUNCTION. OF PENSIONS. IS TO SERVE AS A FLY WHEEL IN THE NATIONAL ECONOMY. TO PROVIDE A RESOURCE SO PEOPLE CAN. EVEN IN A RECESSION DECIDE I'D ACTUALLY LIKE TO HANG IT UP. I'D LIKE TO HAVE MORE TIME MY WIFE MY GRAND KIDS GO FISHING. GO VISIT THOSE PLACES I'VE OFTEN THOUGHT I WANT TO GO WHILE I STILL HAVE MY HEALTH. CREATOR MEANS FOR PEOPLE LEAVE ORGANIZATIONS OPEN THEM UP FOR THE NEW COLLEGE GRADUATES. JUST SEEMS TO ME THAT IS A CONSCIOUS TO HAPPEN I I ACTUALLY THINK. WE COULD DO LOOKING BACK TO THIS MODEL IN THE GOVERNMENT CODE. WE GET UNDER TAKE A MORE SYSTEMATIC ROBUST THOROUGH EXAMINATION AND THEN YOU START TRYING TO DEAL WITH. ALL -- PADS AND OTHER SORTS OF THINGS BUT YOU DO WITH AN INTELLECTUAL FRAMEWORK WHERE YOU'RE SORT OF UNDERSTAND OKAY IS NOT JUST A BENEFACTION. LUCKY THEY GOT THEIRS AND SOMEONE ELSE GOT [inaudible] MESSED UP. AND PERSONALLY I ACTUALLY THINK THAT THE WHOLE MOVEMENT TO FOR A ONE CASE ARISES FROM THE AVON LETTER WHICH WAS USE US DEPARTMENT LABOR PAIN AND LETTER. IN. NINETEEN NINETY TWO THAT SAID PRIVATE PENSION SYSTEMS HAD TO VOTE THEIR SHARES IN ACCORDANCE WITH. THE BENEFICIARIES OF PRIVATE PLAN SOMETHING GM CHRYSLER FORD. THEY DIDN'T JUST WANT TO GO THE ANNUAL MEETING VOTE THEIR SHARES ON BEHALF OF MANAGEMENT. BECAUSE THEY WERE THE GM FUND. BUT THEY HAD OF VOTERS MOSES SHARES BASED UPON THE WORKER INTEREST. AND THAT OPINION HIT AND YOU STARTED SEEING THIS MOVEMENT TO FOUR OH ONE K.'S WHICH IS ACTUATED BREAK UP THAT. FOR YOU SURE OBLIGATION AND BUILT DAHLE THE SILOS SO I JUST THINK SOMEBODY'S TO JUMP INTO THAT CONVERSATION I THINK HERE IN CALIFORNIA WE ARE IN A GOOD POSITION TO DO THAT. THESE SYSTEMS OPERATE OVER THIRTY FOUR FRAME. AND SO HISTORICALLY WE'VE SEEN OUR PRINCES US IN A BAD PLACE THEY DO ADJUST THE CERTAINTY LEADERSHIP FROM. FROM THESE TWO COMMITTEES IN THE LEGISLATURE. BUT I JUST FEEL LIKE. WE START GETTING INTO -- PAD IN THE BURDEN ON CITIES ALL THAT. WE NEED SOME DETACHED REFLECTION TO KIND OF REFLECT UPON WHERE IS THIS ALL GOING. WHAT'S THE ULTRA PUBLIC GOOD THAT WE'RE TRYING TO SUPPORT BECAUSE IT DEFINITELY IS HERE. AND THEN START MAKING CHOICES IN ACCORDANCE WITH THAT SO I I'M SORRY FOR JUST JUMP. BUT SOME REMEMBER O'DONNELL SAID ABOUT THE FLY WHEEL YES. EDU PRETTY BIG STUFF THERE MISTER COOLEY -- BUT EITHER WAY JUST QUICKLY I JUST WANTED. MISTER HUTCHINGS ELITIST I'VE GREAT COMMENTS ON DIVESTMENT DOES NOT THE ROLE OF THE STATE LEGISLATURE TO GUIDE THE INVESTMENT STRATEGY. ARE PENSION FUNDS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND WE NEED TO BE VERY RESISTANT ON THAT OF LANGUAGE AND I'D LIKE TO SEE THAT IN COMMITTEE WHEN THOSE COME UP BECAUSE I'M SURE IT'LL BE FIVE OR SIX THIS YEAR. AND IT IS MY HOPE THAT THE COMMITTEE WOULD REJECT THEM BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT GOOD STRATEGIES -- IN THE IMPACT THE OVERALL HEALTH OF OUR PENSION SYSTEM FRAZIER -- IN THE THE IF WE'RE GONNA TALK ABOUT -- SOME SOME SOME NECESSARY SOCIAL ELEMENTS WE CAN TALK ABOUT THOSE AT THAT AT THE PENSION BOARD LEVEL. THAT'S WHERE THAT CONVERSATION BELONGS SO I APPRECIATE THAT. AND JUST REGARD WITH REGARD TO THE PENSION ISSUE OVER ALL I THINK ANYTHING WE CAN DO AS A STATE AND ACTUALLY LOCALS. TO TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS TO PAY DOWN THAT DEBT AND A MORE AGGRESSIVE FASHION -- WOULD BE WOULD BE IN A NET POSITIVE FOR US LONG TERM WITH THAT THANK YOU YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS COMMITTEE MEMBERS. SEEN NONE THANKS VERY MUCH FOR YOUR INPUT THANK YOU AND THANK YOU AND MOVE ON WITH THAT SAID WILL MOVE ON TO OUR LAST PANEL. PUBLIC EMPLOYEES OR REPRESENTATIVES ROLE. WE'RE FROM THE STATE WE HAVE MERRY HERNANDEZ EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR SEIU LOCAL. ONE THOUSAND AT THE LOCAL LEVEL WHERE OF CHRISTY BROWN MONTH LEGISLATIVE ADVOCATE CALIFORNIA PROFESSIONAL FIREFIGHTERS. AND FROM THE SCHOOLS WE HAVE JAY IT'S PORK ASK JOHN. A I'M SORRY SUBDIRECTOR OF GOVERNMENT RELATIONS. CALIFORNIA SCHOOL EMPLOYEES ASSOCIATION AND THE SET BRAMBLE LEGISLATIVE ADVOCATE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE WITH US ONCE AGAIN YOU HAVE A TWENTY MINUTES. WHOEVER START -- I WAS JUST ADMIRING CHRISTIE'S. TECHNOLOGY HERE I'M A LITTLE BIT I GUESS FASHION. HERE NOW I GOT THE GLASSES NOW BUT DON'T HAVE THE I. PAD A WORK ON THAT ALL I'M GONNA LET IT ON KNOW ABOUT THAT -- SO THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR ALLOWING LOCAL ONE THOUSAND TO BE HERE TODAY -- TO PROVIDE OUR PERSPECTIVE ON THIS IMPORTANT HEARING. THANK YOU -- MR TEARS AND THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS -- FOR INVITING LOCAL. ONE THOUSAND SO MY NAME IS MERRY HERNANDEZ I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR AT SEIU. ONE THOUSAND AND WE REPRESENT NINETY SIX THOUSAND STATE EMPLOYEES AND NINE BARGAINING UNITS ACROSS FOURTEEN HUNDRED WORK SITE. I THINK THE CAL HR DIRECTOR USED A LARGER NUMBER SO WE CAN GO WITH HER NUMBER IF -- IN A FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE RECORD FORM MANY DIFFERENT KINDS OF WORK INCLUDING TESTING CRIMINAL EVIDENCE. ISSUING DRIVERS LICENSES PROVIDING HEALTHCARE TEACHING AT THE SCHOOL FOR THE DEAF AND BLIND JUST TO NAME. A FEW A WE ARE THE LARGEST STATE EMPLOYEE UNION IN CALIFORNIA NATIONALLY WE ARE THE LARGEST PUBLIC SECTOR UNION AND SEIU. OUR MEMBERS EARN A MEDIAN WAGE OF SIXTY THOUSAND DOLLARS IN OUR PURCHASING POWER ADDS OVER EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS TO THE CALIFORNIA ECONOMY. WE REPRESENT A WORKFORCE THAT'S COMPRISED OF 66% WOMEN. 34% MEN AND THE END. OF 62% PEOPLE OF COLOR. AND WE ARE COMPRISED OF ROUGHLY BUT LOOK WHAT LOCAL ONE THOUSAND DOES GOES FAR BEYOND TRADITIONAL LABOR ROLES -- WE BELIEVE UNIONS HAVE A DUTY TO DO MORE. FOR THEIR MEMBERS THAN JUST REPRESENT THEM IN CONTRACT NEGOTIATIONS AND ENFORCEMENT. WE ARE STRONG ADVOCATES I WAS HAPPY TO HEAR THE CONVERSATION AROUND PENSIONS BUT WE ARE STRONG ADVOCATES FOR OUR MEMBERS TO RETIRE SECURE RETIREMENT SECURITY BUT WE ALSO WANT THE CALIFORNIA WHERE EVERYONE. CAN RETIRE WITH PEACE OF MIND. AND WHILE I CAN RECITE A HANDFUL OF STATISTICS ABOUT WHO OUR MEMBERSHIP IS THE IMPORTANT SERVICES WE PROVIDE AND HOW WE REPRESENT THEM IN STATE CIVIL SERVICE. AT THE END OF THE DAY I DON'T WANT YOU TO REMEMBER STATISTICS I WANT YOU TO REMEMBER THE PEOPLE OF LOCAL. ONE THOUSAND WHAT AT WHAT A WHAT A STRONG UNION CONTRACT I I THINK I'M AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT A STRONG UNION UNION CONTRACT DOES. MY FATHER WAS A MEMBER OF CSEA AND BECAUSE OF HIS CONTRACT I WAS ABLE TO HAVE OPPORTUNITIES AND TO BE HERE TODAY IN FRONT OF SUCH A DISTINGUISHED BODY. IT IN A IN A VERY PROFESSIONAL ROLE -- BUT LET ME TELL YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT BRENDA FERGUSON. SHE IS A TWENTY TWO YEAR. EMPLOYEE AT THE DEPARTMENT OF MOTOR VEHICLES SHE'S A MOTHER OF THREE BOYS SHE'S BEEN BLESSED WITH TWELVE GRAND BABIES. OF WHICH THE OLDEST IS TWENTY ONE THE YOUNGEST IS TWO AND IN HER UNION SHE HAS GROWN INTO A COMMUNITY FORCE. HE HAS LED INCREDIBLE COMMUNITY SERVICE PROGRAMS SUCH AS VITA -- CASH FOR COLLEGE -- TO ENSURE THAT WE DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO FIND THE MONEY TO MAKE COLLEGE POSSIBLE FOR YOUNG ASPIRING MINDS. INTO ORGANIZES SACRAMENTO CREEK WEEK SO THAT OUR MEMBERS HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE IN THE RIVER CLEANUP AND GIVE BACK. SHE'S ALSO BEEN A FORCE IN FIGHTING FOR FORMAL HOUSING BECAUSE RENTS ARE OUT OF CONTROL AND DOING NOTHING IS NOT AN OPTION. A ROSE -- DEL ROSA IS AN EMPLOYMENT PROGRAM REPRESENTATIVE AT THE EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT IN WEST COVINA THAT'S A MOUTHFUL. OF SO SOME OF YOU MAY HAVE HEARD ROSA STORY IN TWO THOUSAND AND NINE YOU REMEMBER -- STATE WORKERS WERE FURLOUGHED THREE DAYS A MONTH AND DURING THE SAME TIME ROSE HIS BROTHER WAS KILLED. HE WAS A CONTRIBUTOR TO THE HOUSEHOLD EXPENSES. SUB ROSA ALSO CARED FOR FOR SO ANYONE OF THESE CIRCUMSTANCES WOULD BE TOUGH ALL ON ITS OWN TO PUT THEM ALL TOGETHER AND THAT WAS HER LIFE. AND AS A RESULT OF THE FINANCIAL HARDSHIPS SHE WAS TWO WEEKS LATE IN HER MORTGAGE IN ONE OF THE BANK DO THEY MOVE TO FORECLOSE ON HER HOME. SO SOMEBODY WHO WAS FURLOUGHED LOST HER BROTHER WAS CARING FOR HER DISABLED MOTHER WAS NOW UNDER THE THREAT OF EVICTION AND BECOMING HOMELESS. BUT THAT'S WHEN HER UNION IN HER COMMUNITIES STEPPED UP TO HELP HER FIGHT AGAINST THE BANKS. A YOUNG COMMUNITY ACTIVIST NAME WENDY CARILLO WAS PART OF THAT FIGHT IN TOGETHER UNION AND HER COMMUNITY STOOD BY HER TO FIGHT AGAINST THE BANKS. INTO AN AND THEY ONE SO IT LOCAL ONE THOUSAND WERE GUIDED BY OUR PURPOSE STATEMENT THE PURPOSE OF LOCAL ONE THOUSAND IS TO HAVE THE POWER NECESSARY TO GIVE OUR MEMBERS. AND ALL CALIFORNIANS THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE A GOOD LIFE LIVE IN SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES AND ENJOY THE FRUITS OF SOCIAL ECONOMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE. SO YES IT'S ESSENTIAL TO HAVE A STRONG CONTRACT THAT PROVIDES FOR GOOD WAGES GOODBENEFITS A STRONG STRONG WORKPLACE PROTECTIONS FOR OUR WORK DOESN'T STOP THERE. WE HAVE A DUTY TO ENSURE THAT ALL OF OUR CHILDREN'S EDUCATION IS SOLID WE HAVE A DUTY TO ENSURE THE ENVIRONMENT IS PROTECTED. FOR ALL GENERATIONS AND WE HAVE A DUTY TO ENSURE THAT YOU CAN WALK FREELY ON THIS EARTH AND THAT YOU ARE NOT TARGETED BECAUSE OF THE COLOR YOUR SKIN. OF THE COUNTRY OF ORIGIN OR WHO YOU LOVE. SO IF YOU REMEMBER ANYTHING ABOUT WHO LOCAL ONE THOUSAND IS AND WHAT OUR ROLE IS I REMEMBER ROSE GET DOWN REMEMBER BRENDA FERGUSON. AND REMEMBER THAT OUR MEMBERS ARE MORE THAN JUST A TO SIX FOR LEADERS AND WE ARE CALIFORNIA THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU CHRISTY FOR GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEES. OF MY NAME'S KRISTY BOMB I'M THE DIRECTOR OF GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS FOR THE CALIFORNIA PROFESSIONAL FIREFIGHTERS. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO APPEAR BEFORE YOU THIS MORNING AND SPEAK ON BEHALF OF HALF OVER. THIRTY THOUSAND MEMBERS OF CALIFORNIA'S PROFESSIONAL FIREFIGHTERS. WE'RE THIRTY THOUSAND COMMITTED COURAGEOUS MAN WOMAN WOMEN WORKING IN YOUR COMMUNITIES. ANSWERING THE CALL EVERYDAY TO EVERY TYPE OF EMERGENCY FROM THE TAP CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRE TO THE LIFESAVING MEDICAL CALLS THAT CAN HAPPEN AROUND THE CORNER. A CPF IS IN ESSENCE A UNION OF UNIONS THE NEARLY A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY LOCALS REPRESENTED BY CPF IN CALIFORNIA. UP REPRESENT THOSE THIRTY THOUSAND LOCAL STATE AND FEDERAL FIREFIGHTERS WITH IN CALIFORNIA. WE ARE CONSIDERED THE STATE COUNCIL OF THE INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF FIRE FIGHTERS AND ALL OF ITS AFFILIATES ARE AYE A. F. F. LOCALS. BUT LIKE ANY PUBLIC EMPLOYMENT ORGANIZATION OUR MISSION IS TO WORK TO IMPROVE THE LIVES WHAT HAPPENED WON'T SCROLL. OF WE WORK DIVERSITY. TO IMPROVEMENTS IN THE LIVES OF OUR MEMBERS -- LIVELIHOODS AND IN THE CASE IN THIS CASE FRONTLINE FIREFIGHTERS FOR MORE THAN EIGHT DECADES CPF HAS WORKED ON BEHALF OF PAID AND PROFESSIONAL FIREFIGHTERS IN THE LEGISLATURE AND ACROSS STATE AGENCIES. WE ARE NOT LIKE LOCAL ONE THOUSAND THE BARGAINING AGENT FOR FIREFIGHTERS IN CALIFORNIA THAT'S THE JOB OF OUR LOCAL UNIONS. RATHER WE PURSUE LAWS AND POLICIES. WORKING WITH ALL OF YOU. OTHER ALLOW LOCAL AFFILIATES TO EFFECTIVELY BARGAIN AT THE WORKPLACE FOR PAY AND BENEFITS AND WORKING CONDITIONS AND RETIREMENT SECURITY FOR MEMBERS. IN FIGHTING ON BEHALF OF OUR MEMBERS WERE ALSO WORKING TO SECURE AND PROMOTE THE SAFETY OF ALL CALIFORNIANS WE FIGHT HERE. TO ENSURE THAT OUR FIRE SERVICES A PROPERLY STAFFED EQUIPPED AND TRAINED TO MEET THE SAFETY NEEDS OF OUR STATE. THE OUR WORK IN SACRAMENTO OVER THE YEARS IMPROVED PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT REQUIREMENTS THE CHILLED FIREFIGHTERS FROM THE EXTREME CONDITIONS THAT ARE PART OF THEIR JOB EVERY DAY. OUR WORK CAN BE SEEN IN THE WORKERS COMPENSATION PROTECTIONS THAT WE ASK YOU TO SUPPORT FOR JOB BECAUSE ILLNESSES AND INJURIES. OF PROTECTIONS THAT RECOGNIZE THE HEALTH AND SAFETY RISKS THAT ARE PART OF THIS JOB. OF WHEN OUR WORK CAN BE SEEN IN WORKING FOR SECURE RETIREMENT FOR OUR FIREFIGHTERS THAT EARNED AND WHERE THE WEAR AND TEAR AND THE HUMAN TOLL. OF THIS OF DIFFICULT JOB. BUT IT CAN BE SEEN IN PROTECTIONS AGAINST RETALIATION DISCRIMINATION BAD FAITH BARGAINING INCLUDING OUR BASIC FIREFIGHTER BILL RATES SO THEY CAN PERCEIVE DUE PROCESS. A IN THE PROTECTION OF THEIR JOB. IN WI FI FOR LOCALS IN THIS CAPITOL FOR LOCALS CAN DO RIGHT BY THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO PUT ON THE UNIFORM EVERYDAY. AND PROTECT THE STATE. IN SACRAMENTO THE DECISIONS THAT YOU MAKE DIRECTLY IMPACT THE LIVES IN THE FUTURES OF THESE DEDICATED PUBLIC SERVANTS. FIREFIGHTERS AND EVERY LOCAL PUBLIC EMPLOYEE THAT I'M SITTING HERE TO REPRESENT TODAY. LIKE ALL PUBLIC WORKERS FIREFIGHTERS DESERVE A VOICE IN THE HALLS OF POWER. AND AS A UNION ORGANIZATION WE HOPE TO GIVE THEM THAT VOICE. OF THE CAUSE IS NOBLE NECESSARY. A U. S. FIRST DID SPEAK ABOUT SOME OF OUR PRIORITIES IN THE COMING SESSION. OF THAT AFFECT THE LIVES AND HEALTH AND SAFETY OF FIREFIGHTERS. BUT ONE THAT IS A BECOME OF GREAT PROMINENCE SO RECOGNITION AND ALSO RECOGNITION BY THE COMMUNITY IS UNBEARABLE MENTAL AND EMOTIONAL TOLL OF THE JOB WE DO. A TO MEET THIS CHALLENGE WE'RE LOOKING TO AUTHORIZE APPEAR SUPPORT PROGRAM THAT INCLUDES STATE STANDARDS AND CONFIDENTIALITY SO WE CAN WORK TO HEAL OUR OWN. UGH BUT THIS EXTREME MENTAL TOLL ALSO ACCUMULATES OVER TIME. LEADING TO POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS AND SOMETIMES TRAGICALLY SUICIDE. TO MEET THIS CHALLENGE CPF IS SEEKING TO HAVE A POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS PRESUMPTION. A TO BE DODD WITH IT WITHIN THE WORKERS COMPENSATION SYSTEM TO PROVIDE TREATMENT ONCE SOUGHT OUT BY FIREFIGHTERS SO THEY CAN GET BACK TO WORK. OF OUR FIVE FIREFIGHTERS ON THE FRONT LINES OF EMS DELIVERY AND BASIC HEALTH CARE -- AND THIS THREAT POSED BY OVERCROWDING EMERGENCY ROOMS TO OUR COMMUNITIES WERE PROPOSING TO IMPROVE EMS DELIVERY IN CALIFORNIA. AND WE UNABASHEDLY SUPPORT FIRE BASED EMS AND COMMUNITY PARAMEDIC SERVICES. BECAUSE SOMETIMES RETIRED FIREFIGHTERS BEEN FORCED TO PAY THE PRICE FOR THE BUREAUCRATIC MISTAKES IN THEIR RETIREMENTS CPF IS PROPOSING AGAIN THIS YEAR. UP TO PROTECT RETIREES FROM FOR THE CLAWBACK OF RETIREMENT BEST BENEFITS THAT WERE PROMISED. AND PAID. FOR AND I AM PROUD. SO VERY PROUD TO BE PART OF CPF IN ITS MISSION FOR NEARLY TWENTY YEARS YOU WILL SEE ME IN THIS COMMITTEE MOST OFTEN AND SOMETIMES MY TEAMMATES. OF MEGAN OR DOUG SUBER'S. OF THERE'S NO HIGHER CALLING THE WORKING TO PROTECT THOSE WHO PROTECT ALL OF US. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME TODAY. THANK YOU AND JACQUELINE LAST ONE THAT ONE OF THE NIELSEN. ARMED GOOD MORNING AND CHAIRMAN RODRIGUEZ AND CHAPARRAL -- MY NAME IS CHAI SO PROCESS -- THE ASSISTANT DIRECTOR FOR GOVERNMENT RELATIONS. AT CSEA -- CSEA REPRESENT -- ESSENTIALLY TWO AND FORTY FIVE THOUSAND CLASSIFIED SCHOOL EMPLOYEES. THESE ALL THE SUPPORT I'VE SAID THIS BODY IN. PREVIOUS ROLES I STARTED MY CAREER WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE AND THEN CAME HERE TO JOIN THE ASSEMBLY EDUCATION COMMITTEE WITH DAN DELAYING EASTON. WHO BECAME A STATE SUPERINTENDENT AND I WAS BROUGHT BACK INTO THE BUILDING WITH THE ASSEMBLY APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE TO OVERSEE QUE TO UNIVERSITY LEGISLATION UNDER TO SPEAKERSHIP? SO I'M WELL AWARE AND WILK FAMILIAR WITH THE KIND OF ALL THE ISSUES -- ON EDUCATION AND AND HAVE BEEN WITH CSEA NOW FOR A NEARLY TWENTY YEARS AND HAVE BEEN WORKING TO COMBINE THE TWO ROUNDS OF LABOR AND EDUCATION. AT THE END OF THE DAY I'LL MEMBERS OF THE FIRST PEOPLE TO STUDENTS WILL SEE A MEMBERS PICK UP THREE TWO AM. TO GET THE BUS STARTED TO BRING THE KIDS TO SCHOOL -- THEY HELP FEED THE KIDS SO THAT THEY ARE READY TO LEARN -- THEY ARE THERE TO HELP US SOME OF ADMINISTRATIVE AND OUT TEACHERS STAFF TO ENSURE THAT KIDS HAVE ALL THE SERVICES THEY NEED TO HAVE TO HAVE A SAFE CLEAN LEARNING ENVIRONMENT. DOES THAT THE MEMBERS THAT WE TALK ABOUT WHEN I TALK ABOUT HOW ISSUES YOU'LL SEE WHAT THEY CARE ABOUT THE MOST THAT IS THE WELFARE OF THE CHILDREN. TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE THE BEST EDUCATION SYSTEM POSSIBLE IN THIS COUNTRY -- THAT'S LITERALLY DER DER GOLDEN LIFE AND YOU SEE THAT IN OUR MISSION -- AS I MENTIONED WE HAVE ABOUT TWO AND FORTY FIVE DOLLARS -- SECRETARY DOES A TEACHER FOOD SERVICE WORKERS SAFETY OFFICERS TECHNOLOGY EXPERTS CUSTODIANS AND OTHER ESSENTIAL EMPLOYEES WHO HELPED TO RUN OUT SCHOOL. WITHOUT US LITERALLY TO SCHOOLS WILL OPEN -- AND YOU KNOW WE WILL ASK A COUPLE QUESTION WHAT'S THE IMPORTANCE OF PHAM REPRESENT PUBLIC EMPLOYEES IN. IN IN IN IN DISPATCH THEIR BODY AND WHAT ARE THE INTERESTS OF OUT OF ORGANIZATION FOR THIS YEAR LEGISLATIVE SESSION. I WOULD SAY THAT YOU KNOW IF YOU HAVE NOT GONE TO A WEBSITE YET PLEASE DO -- WE STARTED IN. NINETEEN TWENTY SEVEN ONE OF THE OLDEST UNIONS AROUND. GOING ON ALMOST A HUNDRED YEARS NOW AND WE STARTED BECAUSE TEN PEOPLE TEND CUSTODIAN NOTICE. THAT A LADY WAS NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO RETIRE WITH ANY TIME SO WE WERE FUNDAMENTAL AND CIVIL FOUNDING MEMBERS WERE ACTUALLY. WALKING THE HALLS OF THIS BUILDING TO WORK WITH -- OF GOVERNOR BLIND AND OTHERS TO HELP ESTABLISH WHAT'S NOW TO BE KNOWN AS THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC EMPLOYEES RETIREMENT SYSTEM. VERY PEOPLE PEOPLE KNOW THAT AND I WEBSITE WILL SHARE AGAIN WOULD HAVE SOME HISTORICAL DOCUMENTS WHICH A LOT OF THE STAFF IN THE BUILDING AND MEMBERS WHO GO BACK AND MEMBER. CLOUT THAT DOES NOT A FOUNDING DOCUMENTS TO HELP CREATE THIS SYSTEM THAT WE NOW HAVE -- AND THAT WAS BACK IN NINETEEN TWENTY SEVEN TODAY WE CONTINUE TO FIGHT FOR BETTER PAY AND WORKING CONDITIONS FOR MEMBERS. AND IN RECENT YEARS YOU KNOW AS YOU -- MY BOSS WHO'S RETIRING WITH THE DAVE LOCAL -- YOU KNOW WE'VE BEEN ADDED AND WE'VE BEEN SUCCESSFUL ON TWO KEY AREA WHICH IS ON PENSION FIGHT. AND IN EUROPE STOPPING ON THE EFFORT TO PRIVATIZE OUR MEMBERS JOBS. THERE'S A VALUE TO SOMEONE WHO HAS EXPERIENCE IF YOU TRIED TO BRING IN SOMEBODY WITH NO UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THE NEEDS OF THE CHILDREN ARE. ALL THE ROUTES OF THE BUSES TO HOW THE CATHETER SHOULD BE REPLACED TO HOW TO PROTECT THE KIDS WHEN THEY'RE NOT IN THE CLASSROOM. DOES THAT THE EXPERIENCE YOU WANT AND WHEN YOU CONTRACT OUT. YOU LOSE ALL THAT YOU GO TO THE LOWEST BID. AND INSTEAD OF HAVING THAT LONG TERM EXPERIENCE THE DEDICATION ON CAMPUS YOU LOSE ON ALL THOSE KINDS OF THINGS SO THOSE ARE THE ESSENTIAL FIGHT THAT WE HAVE. AND THAT'S JUST TO QUICKLY GO OVER SOME OF OUR PRIORITIES HERE. UNITE YOU KNOW WE'VE HAD LONG TERM RELATIONSHIP WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND WORKING ON SO MANY DIFFERENT ISSUES -- I WOULD JUST MENTION THAT YOU KNOW THE ONE OF THE FIRST ISSUE THAT WE'RE WORKING WITH A NUMBER OF OTHER KEY UNIONS S. YET YOU SEE T. A.. R. THE FIREFIGHTERS AND OTHERS THE PUBLIC UNIONS OF ONE THOUSAND ALSO A IS TO ENSURE THAT RELEASE TIME FOR ALL MEMBERS TO DO THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING BUT IT'S WELL -- ACCOMMODATED OF WELL LISTED BONTA TO TRY TO MAKE IT CLEAR THAT. THESE EMPLOYEES SHOULD HAVE THE RIGHT AND THE TIME TO AT LEAST GO MEET WITH EMPLOYERS. AND ONE OF THE NEW THINGS THAT HAS BEEN IN PLACE -- BY GOVERNOR BROWN WHICH IS TO ALLOW US TO BE ABLE TO TALK TO NEW EMPLOYEES AT THE ON A PLAY ORIENTATION -- WE WOULD LIKE TO MAKE SURE THAT AND THOSE KINDS OF ACTIVITIES THAT INCLUDE SO THAT'S ONE OF OUR FIRST PRIORITIES. AND THIS BILL -- YET ISSUES YOU'LL SEE BECAUSE WE BRIDGE THE WILL OF LABOR AND EDUCATION CHARTER SCHOOL I KNOW ASSEMBLYMAN. O'DONNELL IS OUT IN A SPARE HEADING OF A BIG EFFORT TO KIND OF MAKE MAKE IT MAKE SENSE. RIGHT THEY WERE INTENDED AND I WAS HERE WHEN THEY WERE CREATED THAT WERE INTENDED TO BE ONE HUNDRED INNOVATIVE SCHOOLS. BUT WE HAVE NOT HEARD VERY MUCH ABOUT WHAT SOME OF THOSE INNOVATIONS ARE. YES THERE ARE SUCCESS WHOSE CHARTER SCHOOL IN SOME PLACES IN OUR STATE BUT WHEN THEY'VE GROWN FROM A HUNDRED TO THIRTEEN HUNDRED WE'RE SEEING A LOT MORE OF THE ABUSES. AND THE PLENTY OF STUDIES THAT WILL POINT OUT WHAT HAPPENED WHEN YOU START CONTRACTING OUT WHAT HAPPENED WHEN YOU HAVE SELF DEALING THAT'S WHAT ALL DOES COUNT CONFLICT OF INTEREST ISSUES. COME BACK INTO PLAY WITH THAT ISSUE IS A AND THE GOVERNOR AND TO TRY TO PROVIDE MORE ACCOUNTABILITY. TO THAT PROCESS -- IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET I THINK WE TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT PENSION POSE AND STOWS. WOULD REALLY -- YOU KNOW EXCITED TO HEAR THAT THE GOVERNOR. SEES IN THE IMPORTANCE OF PENSION AND WHAT THAT'S A WAY TO RECRUIT PEOPLE AS TO BE TO INSURE THAT WE HAVE THE BEST WORKERS POSSIBLE.

GO HEAD NECK. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MY NAME IS SET BROWN BILL I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION. CTA EXISTS TO ADVANCE THE CAUSE OF A FREE UNIVERSAL IN QUALITY PUBLIC EDUCATION. WE WERE FOUNDED IN. EIGHTEEN SIXTY THREE CITY HAS BEEN WORKING TO IMPROVE THE CONDITIONS OF TEACHING AND LEARNING NOW FOR MORE THAN A HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEARS. WE ACHIEVED OUR FIRST LEGISLATIVE VICTORY IN EIGHTEEN SIXTY SIX WITH THE ESTABLISHMENT OF FREE PUBLIC SCHOOLS FOR ALL CHILDREN IN CALIFORNIA. IN NINETEEN TWENTY SEVEN SEAT TO A ONE A MAJOR LEGAL VICTORY WHEN THE SUPREME COURT RULED THAT THE SCHOOL BOARD CANNOT FIRE A FEMALE TEACHER SIMPLY BECAUSE SHE GOT MARRIED. IN THE YEAR OF MY BIRTH NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE CTA LED THE FIGHT TO ESTABLISH COLLECTIVE BARGAINING IN CALIFORNIA FOR PUBLIC SCHOOL EMPLOYEES. CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION EXISTS TO PROTECT AND PROMOTE THE WELL BEING OF ITS MEMBERS WE NOW REPRESENT MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND EDUCATORS IN CALIFORNIA ARE MEMBERS ARE CLASSROOM TEACHERS THEIR SCHOOL COUNSELORS THEIR SCHOOL LIBRARIANS. SOCIAL WORKERS SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGIST SCHOOL NURSES. THESE EDUCATORS IN THE K. TWELVE SCHOOL SYSTEM I JOIN BY COMMUNITY COLLEGE FACULTY CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY FACULTY. AND EDUCATION SUPPORT PROFESSIONALS TO MAKE C. T. A THE MOST INCLUSIVE AND POWERFUL VOICE OF EDUCATORS IN THE STATE AS EDUCATORS WE ARE DEEPLY COMMITTED TO THE SUCCESS OF EVERY STUDENT I KNOW THAT. MY BROTHER JOHN I WAS TALKING SOME ABOUT HIS BACKGROUND SO I'LL GIVE YOU SOME OF MINE JUST TO ILLUMINATE THE STRUCTURE OF C. T. I WAS A CLASSROOM TEACHER IN SAN JOSE -- I WAS ON THE BARGAINING TEAM FO THE MOUNT PLEASANT EDUCATION ASSOCIATION IN SAN JOSE. I WAS AN ELECTED PRESIDENT OF MY LOCAL CHAPTERS SO WE HAVE A SYSTEM OF LOCAL CHAPTERS ALL OVER THE STATE. OF CTA LOCALS -- AND YOU KNOW WE'RE CERTAINLY NEGOTIATING ENFORCING CONTRACTS WHICH ARE APPROVED BY THE MEMBERSHIP IN EACH ONE OF THOSE. LOCAL ASSOCIATIONS -- C. T. EIGHT DOES SUPPORT THOSE LOCALS IN COMMUNICATIONS AND BUDGET ANALYSIS ALL KINDS OF OTHER SUPPORT WE PROVIDE -- THE JOB I HAD MOST RECENT TO BEING HERE WAS AS THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE SACRAMENTO SEATS CITY TEACHERS ASSOCIATION. I THINK THAT WAS MORE THAN A DECADE AGO BUT BUT DIDN'T DO AGAIN STAFF WORK FOR THE ORGANIZATION CONNECTING ALL THE RESOURCES OF CTA TO THAT LOCAL CHAPTERS SACRAMENTO CITY TEACHERS ASSOCIATION. HOW DO WE TAKE POSITIONS ON LEGISLATION WE HAVE? A GROUP THAT'S KIND OF SEPARATE FROM HOW ARE LOCAL CHAPTERS ARE ELECTED THAT ELECTS FOLKS STATEWIDE TO SOMETHING CALLED SEA TO A STATE COUNCIL AND SO SEVEN HUNDRED EIGHT HUNDRED MEMBERS COME TOGETHER AND HAVE A MEETING LITERALLY NOT JUST THE RIGHT POLICY AND GIVE ME MY MARCHING ORDERS. BUT ALSO TO TAKE POSITIONS ON LEGISLATION VERY FUN TO WATCH EIGHT HUNDRED PEOPLE HAVE A MEETING TO DEBATE A PIECE OF LEGISLATION -- BUT WE ARE FIERCELY DEMOCRATIC. THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION EGGS DIGNITY AND CIVIL RIGHTS OF ALL CHILDREN AND YOUTH ARE PROTECTED ORGANIZATIONALLY WE ARE IMPLEMENTING A STUDENT CENTERED PROACTIVE AGENDA FOR PUBLIC EDUCATION. BY USING THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA TO PROMOTE THE LEARNING ENVIRONMENT. WE IDENTIFY NETWORKS OF EDUCATORS TO DEVELOP PROFESSIONAL AND CULTURAL CAPITAL TO STRENGTH IN TEACHING AND LEARNING WE ARE AN AFFILIATE OF THE NATIONAL EDUCATION ASSOCIATION. AND PRODUCT DURING CALIFORNIA'S LABOR MOVEMENT -- WE PARTICIPATE IN SOCIAL JUSTICE CAMPAIGNS THAT IMPACT THE LIVES OF OUR EDUCATORS STUDENTS. AND OUR COMMUNITIES. YOU WILL NO DOUBT SEE PROPOSALS A SESSION THAT CAN MAKE THE TEACHING PROFESSION MORE OR LESS ATTRACTIVE TWO COLLEGE STUDENTS SEEKING EMPLOYMENT OPTIONS. SO I WOULD ASK YOU TO CONSIDER WHEN YOU SEE THESE PROPOSALS WHETHER YOUR CHILDREN WOULD BE MORE LIKELY TO CHOOSE TEACHING AS A PROFESSION BASED ON THAT PROPOSAL. A CT MEMBERS REPRESENT A FULL SPECTRUM OF PROFESSIONS WITHIN CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS AND COLLEGES AND TAKE ENORMOUS PRIDE. IN THEIR WORK AND WE ASK YOU TO RECOGNIZE EDUCATION PROFESSIONALS FOR THE EXPERTS THAT THEY ARE. AS TRUSTED PROFESSIONALS EDUCATORS ARE BEST EQUIPPED TO MAKE SCHOOL AND CLASSROOM DECISIONS TO ENSURE STUDENT SUCCESS FINALLY. THE ATTACKS COMING ON THE LABOR MOVEMENT THREATEN CALIFORNIA VALUES I AS I MENTIONED I WAS A CLASSROOM TEACHER AND THE UNION PRESIDENT I'M A BELIEVER IN COLLECTIVE ACTION I'M A BELIEVER IN COLLECTIVE VOICE. I'M A BELIEVER IN WORKERS COMING TOGETHER IN A UNION ESPECIALLY IN THE ENVIRONMENT OF PUBLIC EDUCATION WHERE BILLIONAIRES WHO HAVE NEVER TAUGHT IN THE CLASSROOM IN SOME CASES NEVER SET FOOT IN A PUBLIC SCHOOL. BELIEVE THEY KNOW BETTER. OF THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION EXISTS TO SECURE A MORE JUST EQUITABLE AND DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY I REALLY THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY AND FOR YOUR TIME.
