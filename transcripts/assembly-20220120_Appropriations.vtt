BUILDINGS IT DOES HURT SMALL

01:19:43.278 --> 01:19:44.546
OWNERS. BECAUSE THEY NOT CANNOT

01:19:44.613 --> 01:19:46.748
SELL THEIR BUILDINGS TO ANYONE

01:19:46.815 --> 01:19:49.050
WHO WISHES TO OCCUPY AND THAT

01:19:49.117 --> 01:19:51.153
INCLUDES TENANTS WHO WISH TO BUY

01:19:51.219 --> 01:19:51.953
THE PROPERTY SOME OWNERS EVEN

01:19:52.020 --> 01:19:53.455
TENANTS COME TOGETHER TO BUY

01:19:53.522 --> 01:19:54.523

01:20:21.249 --> 01:20:21.883
INCREDIBLE AMOUNT TO PROTECT

01:20:21.950 --> 01:20:24.386
