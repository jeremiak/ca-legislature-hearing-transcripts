RIGHT TIME TO OPEN UP DISCUSSION OF POSSIBLE. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS AND STAFF OF PEACH I THINK. CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES JUST A BROAD BACKGROUND WE APPRECIATE THE THOROUGH DESCRIPTION AND THE AGENDA OF WHAT ELECTRONIC VISIT VERIFICATION IS. IT STANDS OUT OF A FEDERAL STATUTE ENACTED IN A DECEMBER OF TWENTY SIXTEEN. ARE IN A BASICALLY REQUIRES ELECTRONIC VISIT VERIFICATION. A OF THE THE THINGS DESCRIBED ON THE BOTTOM OF PAGE ONE AND ON TO PAGE TWO OF FOUR PROVIDERS SERVING. RECIPIENTS OF ABOUT PERSONAL CARE SERVICES AND EVENTUALLY HOME CARE SERVICES AS WELL THE FEDERAL IMPLEMENTATION DUE DATE. IS JANUARY ONE OF TWENTY NINETEEN THERE ARE SOME EXCEPTIONS ARE THAT ALLOW A BASED ON GOOD FAITH EFFORTS ARE UNFORESEEN DIFFICULTIES. BEFORE. STATES TO ASK FOR EXCEPT ANNA EXTENSION OF THAT DATE FOR UP TO A YEAR A WE'VE ALREADY INDICATED IN OUR STAKEHOLDER PROCESS THAT WE PLAN TO DO THAT. LET ME KNOW IF YOU NEED A BACKGROUND ON WHAT EVEY V. S. ARE NOT GOOD OKAY NOW SO PROCESS WAS THE FEDERAL STATUTE ALSO REQUIRES A VERY ROBUST STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT PROCESS. WHICH WE TYPICALLY DO ANYWAY IN THESE PROGRAMS BUT IT ALSO REQUIRES THAT THE ULTIMATE SOLUTION THAT. SELECTED FOR IMPLEMENTATION. IS THE LEAST BURDENSOME FOR THE OF PROVIDERS OF THE SERVICE AND THE CONSUMERS OF THE SERVICE THAT VALIDATE THEIR HOURS. YESTERDAY BEFORE THE SENATE I TOLD YOU WE DIDN'T HAVE CMS GUIDANCE OF SOMEBODY TOLD ME THEY WERE LISTENING BECAUSE IT WAS ISSUED THIS MORNING. WE HAVE OBVIOUSLY NOT READ IT AT THIS POINT ABOUT WILL BE LOOKING TO THAT. AT FIRST GLANCE IT LOOKS MORE LIKE A CLARIFICATION OF WHAT THE LAW ACTUALLY SAYS AS OPPOSED TO THE ACTUAL IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE. BUT WE RESERVE THE RIGHT TO COME BACK AND GIVE YOU MORE MORE DETAILS. AT SOME POINT IN THE FUTURE. AT THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES IS CHAU SARAH DESCRIBED OF FOR YOU THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES PROPOSAL THERE ARE A NUMBER OF PROGRAMS ACROSS OF THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY THAT PROVIDE EITHER PERSONAL CARE SERVICES. OR A HOME HOME. HOME CARE SERVICES. AND SO THE SOLUTIONS IN THOSE DIFFERENT PROGRAMS WILL BE DIFFERENT BASED ON WHERE THEY'RE STARTING FROM. SO SPEAKING JUST FOR THE AYE EXERCISE PROGRAM WE ALSO HAVE A PROPOSAL TO TO FIND A COUPLE POSITIONS TO HELP US WITH THE STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT PROCESS. DID SUBMIT THE DOCUMENTATION THAT WE NEED A TO MAKE CHANGES. TO THE SCENE UP SYSTEM OF FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF VVV. UP WITH THERE IS NO OTHER MONEY A PROPOSED IN THE BUDGET FOR ACT IMPLEMENTATION OF VVV HOWEVER. I WHAT WE ARE PROPOSING A AND IT'S A CHANGE TO WHAT'S REFLECTED IN THE AGENDA BECAUSE WE WE DID THIS LAST. YESTERDAY AFTERNOON WERE WITHDRAWING THE TRAILER BILL PROPOSAL THAT WE HAD THAT WOULD ALLOW IMPLEMENTATION BY ALL COUNTY LETTER. A WITHOUT A RULE MAKING. I'M WHERE INSTEAD REPLACING IT WITH YOU. WITH IT WITH THE PROPOSED PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE THAT WAS HANDED OUT AT THE BEGINNING OF THE HEARING. OF BY MY COLLEAGUE FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. IF I CAN JUST EXPLAIN BECAUSE IT IS NEW A WHAT'S THERE ALSO REPLACES THE LANGUAGE WRITTEN IN YOUR AGENDA. ON. SO THE FIRST THINGS TO KNOW DESIGN. DEVELOPMENT AND INSTALLATION. AND AS WELL AS THE FEDERAL TERMS IN THE STATUTE ARE ELIGIBLE FOR NINETY TURN FEDERAL FUNDING A SHARE SOFA NINETIES. FEDERAL TEN TEN STATE. AND WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING IN IN THE BUDGET. ONCE WE'VE HAD TIME TO DIGEST ON THE FEDERAL GUIDANCE AND COMPLETE OUR STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT PROCESS WE WOULD BE COMING BACK. TO GIVE A NOTIFICATION TO THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE BUDGET COMMITTEE OUT FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. OF AND IN A SIX A ONE THROUGH FOUR ARE ON THE AGENDA YOU SEE WE WOULD BE REPRESENTING. A MUCH MORE ROBUST A REQUEST FOR FUNDING THAN USUAL IT WOULD INCLUDE A JUSTIFICATION FOR THE. INCREASED EXPENDITURES INCLUDING A WRITTEN PLAN DESCRIBING THE PROPOSED APPROACH FOR EVEY V. WITHIN THE IHS US PROGRAM. A DESCRIPTION OF THE STAKEHOLDER PROCESS THAT WE WENT THROUGH ANY INPUT WE RECEIVED AND PARTICULARLY ANY INPUT WE RECEIVE THAT IS NOT REFLECTED IN WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING. AND THEN A TIME LINE AND THEN THE STEPS WE WOULD SEE NECESSARY TO ACTUALLY IMPLEMENT THE SOLUTION AND A COST ESTIMATE NOT ONLY FOR EIGHTEEN NINETEEN BUT THE ONGOING. ON THERE'S A SUBDIVISION BE IN THIS LANGUAGE AUTHORIZES THE TRANSFER OF SOME OF THAT FUNDING TO STATE OPERATIONS BUDGET FROM THE LOCAL ASSISTANCE BUDGET. TO COVER ANY STAFFER CONTRACTS THAT WE MAY NEED A FOR CONSULTING SERVICES. AND THEN IN SUBDIVISION SEE IS SOME LANGUAGE AROUND OUR RULE MAKING AUTHORITY. BY LETTER FOR A LIMITED TWO YEAR PERIOD. ONE OF THE CONCERNS THAT'S BEEN RAISED WITH THE LANGUAGE AND WE'RE OPEN TO ADD ADDITIONAL CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THIS. THIS IS OBVIOUSLY SOMETHING THAT HAS A BROAD RANGING IMPACT. THIS LANGUAGE COVERS JUST THE I JUST US PROGRAM BUT THERE'S NEARLY A MILLION PEOPLE ARE THAT WOULD BE POTENTIALLY AFFECTED BY IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS REQUIREMENT. AND WE THINK THAT IT'S APPROPRIATE THAT ADVANCE NOTICE BE GIVEN TO THEM OF WHAT EXACTLY WE'RE TRYING TO DO BASED ON ALL OF THE FEEDBACK WE RECEIVE FROM THEM. ON SO WE'RE OPEN TO ANY TWO WEEKS OF A LANGUAGE THAT WOULD MAKE THAT CLEAR BUT I WANTED TO SAY THAT HERE ON THE RECORD AS WELL. AND AMANDA STOPPED AND IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER THEM. NOW WE WILL BUT DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ILIO. LA UNIFIED SMART ELLIS WHAT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE THE RESOURCES REQUESTED IN THIS PROPOSAL DO APPEAR REASONABLE AND WE UNDERSTAND THE ADMINISTRATION MAY NEED SOME FLEXIBILITY IN IMPLEMENTING EVP. ORIGINAL PROPOSED BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE IN TRAILER BILL WE ARE CONCERNED THAT IT WAS OVERLY BROAD AND LIMITED LIVE LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT. AND WE'RE STILL LOOKING AT THE REVISED LANGUAGE BUT WE DO THINK IT APPEARS TO MOVE IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION THANK YOU. PUBLIC COMMENT ON THE ISSUE ONE. ISN'T ALSO SPEAKING FOR THAT CALIFORNIA JUST US CONSUMERS ALLIANCE AND MOST OF THE REVISED LANGUAGE THAT'S BEEN FOR PUT FORWARD BY THE ADMINISTRATION IS OKAY WITH US EXPENDITURE AUTHORITY THE STAFFING. POSITIONS THAT THEY NEED TO DO ADEQUATE PLANNING AND INTERACTION WITH STAKEHOLDERS WERE CONCERNS THOUGH THAT THEY'RE STILL LANGUAGE THAN THE BUDGET BILL. LANGUAGE PROPOSAL THAT'S OVERLY BROAD THAT WOULD GIVE THEM AS MR SERVING COULD DESCRIBE RULE MAKING AUTHORITY TO IMPLEMENT. EVEY V. THEIR VERY SPECIFIC THINGS THAT THEY'VE TALKED ABOUT THAT SOUND A REASSURING TO STAKEHOLDERS AS THEY'VE BEEN DISCUSSING UV VIS THAT THERE WOULD NOT BE A GPS COMPONENT AND I COULD GO ONE. THAT WE WOULD BE VERY HAPPY TO WORK WITH THE ADMINISTRATION ON TO BE SPECIFIC ABOUT WHAT THEY COULD SPEND MONEY ON. BUT A BROAD AUTHORITY FOR A TWO YEAR PERIOD GIVES THE NEXT GOVERNOR THE ABILITY TO DO SOMETHING THAT THESE GOOD PEOPLE MAY NOT BE CURRENTLY CONTEMPLATING WE CERTAINLY SAW GOVERNOR SCHWARZENEGGER. TURN THE PROGRAM ON ITS HEAD A WHEN HE CAME INTO OFFICE AND WE DON'T KNOW WHO THE NEXT GOVERNOR WOULD BE SO TWO YEARS OPEN AUTHORITIES. NOT SOMETHING THAT WE'RE COMFORTABLE WITH. HER CHILD DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA WE'VE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO LOOK AT THE. PROPOSED TO A BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE SURE FROM LAST NIGHT AND I THINK THAT'S GOING IT IS IN THE DIRECTION THAT WE CAN CERTAINLY LIVE WITH I CAN SAY. YOU KNOW THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS BEEN AND CERTAINLY TRANSPARENT AND WORKED CLOSELY WITH STAKEHOLDERS AND WE APPRECIATE THAT. AND I THINK IT'S KAREN HAS MENTIONED THERE'S ALWAYS CONCERN OF WHAT TIME MAY HAPPEN. IN THE THE FUTURE. SO AS FAR AS THE. THE LANGUAGE UP FRONT ON THE EXPENDITURE AUTHORITY I THINK WE'RE FINE WITH THAT AND I THINK THE ELEMENTS IN THAT ARE GOOD. BUT BUT WE TO SHARE THE CONCERN ABOUT THE. TWO YEAR PERIOD TO ACTUALLY IMPLEMENT. WITHOUT A REGULATION THROUGH ALL COUNTY LETTER HOWEVER I THINK IF SOMETHING IN THIS LANGUAGE WAS PERHAPS. TIED MORE DIRECTLY. IT INTO THE. THEY A LANGUAGE SHE IN A TO BE ANOTHER WORDS IF WE KNOW EVERYTHING THAT. IS BEING LAID OUT IN THE PLAN. BEFORE THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO UTILIZE THE AUTHORITY TO DO YOU EMPLOYMENT BY ALL COUNTY LETTER I THINK THAT WOULD MAKE US FEEL MUCH BETTER AND AND WE CERTAINLY RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE WHEN YOU'RE WORKING AGAINST FEDERAL. TIMELINES TO MOVE QUICKLY AND PARTICULARLY WHERE THERE ARE PENALTIES LE. TO THE STATES WE DON'T WANNA STAND IN THE WAY OF DOING THAT SO SO WE WOULDN'T MIGHT SUGGEST THAT THERE WOULD BE A WAY TO TWEAK THAT SOME. AND AND MAYBE TWO YEARS IS A LITTLE LONG AT THIS POINT BUT. MAYBE A YEAR'S WORTH OF THIS AUTHORITY AND AGAIN THAT FOLLOWS THE THE. THE INFORMATION THAT'S CONTAINED IN PEAK THANKS THANK YOU SIR. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR CRISTINA BOSS HAMILTON WITH YOU W. WE REPRESENT A HUNDRED THOUSAND I JUST AS WORKERS. A ECHO THE COMMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUES FROM KAPPA IN DRC. WE ARE VERY THANKFUL TO THE DEPARTMENT FOR THEIR EFFORTS SO FAR AT TRANSPARENCY. AND IN FACT WHAT THEY PROPOSE TO ME IS. REALLY THE BEST POSSIBLE WAY TO DO THIS THAT IS LEAST BURDENSOME BUT WE JUST NEED TO BUILD IN ACCOUNTABILITY ESPECIALLY IN LIGHT OF A FUTURE ADMINISTRATION WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE FUTURE HOLDS. SO WE'RE REALLY TALKING ABOUT INSURING LEGISLATIVE ACCOUNTABILITY THANK YOU. CHAIR MEMBERS ROBERT HARRIS ON BEHALF SEIU CALIFORNIA I WOULD AGAIN ECHO ALL THOSE THINGS BEER VERY CONCERNED BUT THE TO YOUR. ABILITY TO DO THIS WITHOUT BEING TIED TO ACTUAL THINGS THAT WE KNOW WON'T HAPPEN. OTHER THAN PROMISES AND AND WE TRUST THE PEOPLE UP HERE AND THEY'VE WORKED VERY HARD. TO BE OPEN BUT WE'RE STILL CONCERNED ABOUT THAT TO YOUR AUTHORITY TO TO DO THINGS WITHOUT. HAVING WILD THAT COULD AFFECT THE LIVES OF A MILLION PEOPLE LIKE WE SAID LOOK UP WITHOUT ANY LEGISLATIVE AND PUT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR. SEEING NO FURTHER PUBLIC COMMENT ON BRING IT UP TO THE DYESS AND. I'D LIKE TO ECHO MANY OF THE COMMENTS THAT WERE JUST SAID.

AS THIS PROCESS GOES FORWARD WE WILL WORK WITH YOUR TEAM AND UNDERSTANDS THAT WE HAVE THE LOOMING FISCAL. BUDGET PENALTIES AND THE NEED FOR HAVING TO WORK WITHIN THE SYSTEM BUT. HAVE GRAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS PROGRAM. AND HOW IT WILL IMPACT. PATIENTS CONSTITUENTS PEOPLE OF OUR GREAT STATE AND. JUST WANTS TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR VOICES ARE CONTINUED TO BE HEARD THROUGH THIS PROCESS AND. OF FIND IT UNLIKELY WE WANT TO ABDICATE OUR AUTHORITY FOR TWO YEARS TIME WITHOUT. WANTING TO MAKE SURE THAT. WE CONTINUE TO HAVE SOME ACCOUNTABILITY SOME. WITH THAT WE WILL HOLD ISSUE ONE OPEN AND MOVE ON TO THE NEXT ISSUE WHEN YOU'RE READY.

SO I'LL I'LL BRIEFLY DO THAT AND. MISTER DOYLE WILL GO AHEAD AND ADDRESS A COUPLE OF ADDITIONAL ISSUES THAT WERE IDENTIFIED IN THE AGENDA FOR. A THANK YOU. SO AS THE AGENDA HAS. CORRECTLY HIGHLIGHTED A NUMBER OF AREAS I'LL JUST ON BRIEFLY GO THROUGH THOSE WITH YOU TODAY. IN THE PROPOSED I MAY REVISE WERE LOOKING FOR. PROJECTIONS FOR SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN UPDATED PROJECTED AS FAR AS A NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE SERVING FOR THIS NEXT YEAR. AB WERE ENDING THE YEAR AT AROUND THREE HUNDRED SEVENTEEN THOUSAND FIVE NINETY SIX THIS IS. REFLECTIVE ARE UPDATED PROJECTION. I'M LOOKING AT A DECREASE OF TWO HUNDRED FORTY ONE INDIVIDUALS FROM THE PROPOSED GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. THE. MAY REVISE ALSO REFLECTS UPDATES ON OUR TOTAL FUNDING A TOTAL FUNDING OF SIX POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS TOTAL FUN. I'M AND PART OF THAT IS THAT IN THREE POINT SEVEN BILLION IN GENERAL FUND. THIS REFLECTS A DECREASE I'M FROM THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET OF SIXTEEN POINT SEVEN MILLION IN TOTAL FUND AND FORTY FOUR MILLION. DECREASE IN GENERAL FUND NOT JUST BRIEFLY GO OVER THAT. INFORMATION SO IN OPERATIONS FOR REGIONAL CENTERS. AND IT REFLECTS A DECREASE OF TWO POINT ONE MILLION IN ON. TOTAL FUNDING THREE POINT SIX MILLION IN GENERAL FUND THIS IS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BASED ON UPDATED PROJECTIONS OF REGIONAL CENTER RENT. IN PURCHASE OF SERVICE THAT REFLECTS. A DECREASE FROM GOVERNOR'S BUDGET OF FOURTEEN POINT SIX ON MILLION IN TOTAL FUN AND THEN ALSO A FORTY. POINT THREE MILLION GENERAL FUND DECREASE. PRIMARY DRIVERS FOR FOR THAT IS REFLECTIVE OF UPDATED CASELOAD PROJECTIONS BUT ALSO WHEN YOU SEE BE INCREASE OBJECT FOUND. AS FAR AS THAT THE ADJUSTMENT FOR THE I GENERAL FUND DECREASE THAT'S DRIVEN BASED ON ADDITIONAL FEDERAL REIMBURSEMENTS SO YOU'LL SEE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A TOTAL FUND AND THEN REFLECTED OF THE DECREASE IN THE GENERAL FUND. GOING TO EIGHTEEN NINETEEN. AND WE'RE LOOKING AT. AVERAGE ESTIMATED CASELOAD OF THREE HUNDRED THIRTY TWO THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED THIRTY EIGHT INDIVIDUALS THAT WE WOULD BE SERVING THROUGH THE REGIONAL CENTER SERVICE. I'M DELIVERY DIVERT DELIVERY SYSTEM THAT REFLECTS A DECREASE OF WHAT WAS PROJECTED. BY TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY SIX INDIVIDUALS. I'M ALSO LOOKING AT THE PROJECTED FUNDING I'M AT ESTIMATES AT SIX POINT NINE BILLION DOLLARS TOTAL FUND AND FOUR POINT ONE. ON OF THAT IS IN GENERAL FUND THIS REFLECTS A NET INCREASE OF TWENTY ONE POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS IN TOTAL FUN. AGAIN THIS IS REFLECTIVE OF THE UPDATED CASELOAD IN EXPENDITURES. FOR REGIONAL CENTERS WERE REFLECTING ON PURCHASE OF SERVICE DECREASE OF SIX POINT ONE AND BILLION. IN TOTAL FUND AGAIN ON WITH EIGHTEEN POINT SIX AGAIN UPDATING SOME OF THE FEDERAL REIMBURSEMENTS. IN ADDITION TO UPDATING BASED ON OUR B. H. T. TRANSITION INDIVIDUALS WHO DO NOT HAVE. AUTISM DIAGNOSIS THAT WOULD BE TRANSITIONING TO MEDI CAL. ON THERE'S FOR COUNTIES THAT WERE LOOKING AT THAT WOULD BE DELAYED BY THREE MONTHS AND SO THAT ARE UPDATED PROJECTIONS IS RELATED TO. THAT THE COST OF PROJECTIONS. ALSO REFLECTS THAT FOR INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE MOVING FROM DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS ON THAT WE WOULD BE INCREASING FOR EIGHTEEN NINETEEN. THIRTY EIGHT ADDITIONAL INDIVIDUALS THAT WOULD BE MOVING TO THE COMMUNITY AS SUCH FOR REFLECTING A SLIGHT INCREASE IN COMMUNITY PLACEMENT PLANNED ON PLACEMENTS AND THAT'S TWO POINT TWO MILLION DOLLAR. TOTAL FUN ON PRODUCTION. ADDITIONALLY IN THAT. HOME HEALTH RATE SO THIS IS A EN ON CORRELATION WITH ON THE CORRESPONDING MEDI CAL RATE ADJUSTMENT. IN AREAS OF HOME HEALTH AGENCY LICENSED VOCATIONAL NURSES AND REGISTERED NURSES. AND SO BECAUSE OUR. REGULATIONS ARE CONSISTENT WITH WHAT THE MEDI CAL RADIOS ON WE HAVE THE TIME CORRELATING INCREASE FOR THE HOME HEALTH RATE INCREASED TWENTY NINE POINT FIVE MILLION. ON TOTAL FUN. THIS ALSO AND HAS AN UPDATE ON THE UNIFORM HOLIDAY SCHEDULE WHILE THAT MAY REVISED DOES. CONTINUE TO INCLUDE THE PROJECTION OF ON REINSTITUTING THE UNIFORM HOLIDAYS SCHEDULED THE UPDATED PROJECTION. IS RELATED TO. OUR ESTIMATE WHEN WE DID THE ESTIMATE ORIGINALLY IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET WE HAD. INCORRECTLY USE THAT THE BASE FOR OUR PROJECTIONS OF TWO THOUSAND NINE SO WHAT WE DID IS THAT WE TOOK A LOOK AT THE UPDATED. INFORMATION BASED ON OUR CASELOAD AND UTILIZATION IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN SIXTEEN SO THE. PRODUCTION HERE IS JUST RELATED TO CORRECTING. THE AREA IN OUR ESTIMATES AND THAT REFLECTS FOUR POINT SIX MILLION DOLLAR DECREASE WHICH IS ULTIMATELY RESULTING IN AN ESTIMATED SAVINGS. ON A RELATED TO THE UNIFORM HOLIDAY ON SCHEDULE. FOR DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS ON TODAY WE HAVE FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY SIX INDIVIDUALS IN A DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER. OF THE FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY SIX WE HAVE TWO HUNDRED NINETY THAT ARE A PART OF THE. DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS THAT ARE CLOSING. SO ON MAY REVISE THE PROJECTION FOR SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN IS THAT WE WOULD JUST BE ADJUSTING THE POPULATION ONLY BY THREE INDIVIDUALS AND SO THERE'S A SLIGHT ADJUSTMENT RELATED TO. FRUIT FOR THAT THAT SALARY SAVINGS IS PROJECTED TO UPDATED SALARY PROJECTIONS FOR. OUR STAFFING ON AND THAT'S REFLECTED ELEVEN POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLAR DECREASE FROM WHAT WE HAD IN GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. FOR FISCAL YEAR FOR BUDGET YEAR EIGHTEEN NINETEEN I'M MORE PROTECTING ENDING THE YEAR ON JUNE THIRTIETH TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN AT THREE HUNDRED TWENTY THREE INDIVIDUALS REMAINING AT THE DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS AT THAT TIME. AND WE DO HAVE PROJECTED AS FAR AS THE MAY REVISE FOR UPDATED AND INCREASE IN. OPERATIONS NINE POINT ONE MILLION ON THIS PRIMARILY HAS TO DO WITH. A CORRECTION IN OUR ESTIMATE FROM CINEMA DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER STAFFING WHEN WE HAD COMPLETED THE ESTIMATE ON PRIOR WE HAD ANTICIPATED WHICH WE KNOW WE'RE CLOSING DEVELOP THEM CINEMA BY DECEMBER. IN THE LAST PERSON WILL BE A MOVING OUT BY THAT TIME WE HAD INCORRECTLY. HAVES DAY YEAR SO WE DID A SIX MONTH PROJECTION WE TOOK ANOTHER HALF OFFER THAT WHEN WE DID THE STAFFING PROJECTION. SO WE ONLY PROJECTED AND THE. ESTIMATE FOR US THREE MONTHS WORTH OF STAFFING WHERE THIS. PROVIDES A CORRECTION TO IT IT ALLOWS THAN FOR THE SIX MONTHS TO GET A THROUGH THE SUPPORTING THE INDIVIDUAL THROUGH DECEMBER UNTIL THE CLOSURE. AND ADDITIONALLY WE HAVE PROJECTED AND. THE. DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER BUDGET IS FOR THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE WHICH WILL BE SPEAKING TO I'M SHORTLY REGARDING THE PROPOSAL FOR THE SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS GENERAL FUND. IT JUST BRIEFLY THEN ON HEADQUARTERS THERE'S. PRIMARILY TO TWO ITEMS IN THE. HEADQUARTERS BUDGET ONE IS REALLY RELATED TO THE ISSUE ONE THAT YOU JUST HEARD ON THE OF. ELECTRONIC. VISIT VERIFICATION SO ARE ON HEADQUARTERS BUDGET IT'S I'M REQUESTING THE. THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS RELATED TO TWO POSITIONS TO HELP FOR IMPLEMENTATION. THAT WE ALSO HAVE A I REQUEST ON PERSON CENTERED PLANNING ON THE BCP. SO IT'S FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS ON TO ASSIST US IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE TRAINING AND BE ABLE TO WORK WITH ENGAGEMENT WITH OUR STAKEHOLDERS. I'M REALLY WITH THE VISION I'M NOT GOING TO BE CONSISTENT WITH THE FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR. ON DEVELOPING SERVICE PLANNING FOR INDIVIDUALS CONSISTENT WITH THE FEDERAL I'M RULES FOR PERSON CENTERED FOCUS AND THINKING. BUT WE DO SEE IT AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO SUPPORT ON THE RACIAL CENTERS THE FAMILIES IN THE CONSUMERS TO HAVE KIND OF A FOUNDATION FOR WHERE THEY'RE MOVING AND I'M HAVING ASSURANCE THAT WE HAVE THE TRAINING THAT'S CONSISTENT THROUGHOUT THE STATE. TO ALLOW THEM TO KIND OF BUILD FROM THAT FOR FUTURE. I'M SO HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS OR WE CAN HAVE MISTER DOYLE GO AHEAD AND ADDRESS THE TWO ADDITIONAL ITEMS THAT WERE. IN THE AGENDA FOR YOU.

WHICH INCLUDES DEFERRED MAINTENANCE PROJECTS FOR A NUMBER OF STATE ENTITIES. THE DEPARTMENT OF DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES IS INCLUDED IN THAT THEIR SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS PROPOSED.

IS SENSUALLY. I ISSUE THREE REFLECTS A THE NORMAL CASELOAD ADJUSTMENTS FOR THEM A REVISION. ACROSS THE BOARD CASELOADS ARE FALLING IN A IN A VIRTUALLY ALL OF OUR PROGRAMS. THERE ARE SOME COST INCREASES ARE PARTICULARLY IN THE AYE CHU SASS PROGRAM ALTHOUGH CASELOAD IS DOWN SLIGHTLY FROM WHAT WE PROJECTED IT GOVERNOR'S BUDGET IT'S STILL RISING A LITTLE BIT. OF AN ATHORIZED HOURS PER CASE. AND. THE CAUGHT THE COST PER HOUR ARE AND CONTINUE TO INCREASE THEIR. A ES ASIDE ASSIST P. CONTINUES TO TRY AND VERY SLIGHTLY DOWN THAT'S IN LINE WITH A NATIONAL COMPARISONS OF THAT THAT CASELOAD AS WELL. IN CAL WORKS ARE WE'RE PROJECTING TO HIT A RECORD LOW CASELOADS. GOT GOING AHEAD BY THE END OF THE BUDGET HERE. THE TABLE ON PAGE THIRTEEN AND FOURTEEN OF YOUR AGENDA ACCURATELY REFLECTS THAT THE THINGS THAT WE'VE REQUESTED IN TERMS OF BASELINE ADJUSTMENTS. I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THERE OR I CAN CONTINUE. COULDN'T. ALRIGHT. OTHER BIG THE FIRST ISSUE OF THE FIRST ITEM ON PAGE FOURTEEN IS A COW WORK SINGLE ALLOCATION IN IN THE MAY REVISIONIST COMMITTED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. WE'VE IMPLEMENTED EVAN AMINU METHODOLOGY FOR THE ELIGIBILITY COMPONENT OF THE CAL WORKS SINGLE ALLOCATION. IT ALSO. PROVIDES. IS SOME STABILITY FOR FOR COUNTY OPERATIONS IT RECOGNIZES% THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FIXED COSTS AND VARIABLE COSTS. IN IN THE A FUNDING ALLOCATION AND PROPOSES THAT GOING FORWARD. CASELOADS AND AND COST NEED TO ADJUST BY FIVE PERCENT. EITHER UP OR DOWN BEFORE WE ACTUALLY ADJUST THE ADMINISTRATIVE FUNDING IT PROVIDES A LEVEL OF CERTAINTY BUT ALSO ACCOUNTS FOR ANY MAJOR ADJUSTMENTS IN AND WHAT IT TAKES TO OPERATE THE PROGRAM. ELIGIBILITY WITHIN THE SINGLE ALLOCATION IS JUST ONE COMPONENT OTHER COMPONENTS INCLUDE EMPLOYMENT SERVICES AND OTHER THINGS AND METHODOLOGIES WILL CONTINUE TO BE DEVELOPED. IN INTO THE BUDGET YEAR. FOR THOSE. PRESUMABLY FOR PRESENTATION TO THE LEGISLATURE AND THE COMING FALL BUT IT'S BEEN. HEAVILY COLLABORATIVE EFFORT. WITH COUNTIES AND AND. AND. SEE SACRISTAN ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES AND THE COUNTY WELFARE DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION AND WE'D LIKE TO THANK EVERYBODY FOR ARE GOING BACK AND FORTH WITH US ON THAT. WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO GO THROUGH ALL THE ITEMS YEAH BUT I'LL DO THEM ALL AT ONCE SO ON PAGE FIFTEEN ITEM TO A HOUSING SUPPORT PROGRAM THE BASS FUNDING FOR THIS PROGRAM IS AROUND FORTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. OF THE MAYOR OF VISION PROPOSES TO INCREASE STOP BY TWENTY FOUR MILLION IN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN. WITH ANOTHER SUBSEQUENT ADJUSTMENT OF A SIMILAR AMOUNT IN THE FOLLOWING YEAR TO BRING THE PROGRAM UP TO A TOTAL OF NINETY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS AND NINETY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. A GOING FORWARD WE THINK. AT IT'S NO SECRET TO ANYBODY THAT HOUSING IS A CRISIS IN CALIFORNIA. AND THIS PROGRAM PROVIDE SOME VITAL ASSISTANCE TO FAMILIES AND IN FORM OF BOTH EMERGENCY SHELTER ASSISTANCE ABOUT A MORE MORE IMPORTANTLY AS STABLE LIVING ARRANGEMENTS RENTAL SUBSIDIES AND THOSE KINDS OF THINGS. COUPLED WITH THAT I KNOW THAT THE THIRD ITEM HERE IS AN INCREASE IN THE AILY RATE FOR THE HOMELESS ASSISTANCE PROGRAM. THIS PROGRAM PROVIDES A NINE NIGHTLY RATE FOR A SHELTER FOR. UP TO SIXTEEN DAYS FOR A ONCE A YEAR. I THERE'S A PIECE OF TRAILER BILL TO GO ALONG WITH THAT BECAUSE THIS RATE IS SET IN STATUTE OF THE RATE WOULD BE PROPOSED TO THE STATE AND IN THE AGENDA TO GO FROM. SIXTY FIVE DOLLARS A NIGHT TO EIGHTY FIVE DOLLARS A NIGHT AND I BELIEVE THE LAST TIME IT WAS INCREASED WAS TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT. AND SO I HAVE PROUD TO BE ABLE TO INCLUDE THAT. ON PAGE SIXTEEN ITEM FOR ON THE HOME SAFE PROGRAM THIS IS A PROPOSED A FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLAR AUGMENTATION. TO ADDRESS OUR THE NEEDS OF. SENIORS WHO WERE INVOLVED WITH ADULT PROTECTIVE SERVICES. AGAIN RELATED TO HOUSING GETTING THEM AND POTENTIALLY OUT OF AN ABUSIVE SITUATION OR HELPING THEM. IF THEY'RETRYING TO REMAIN INDEPENDENT TO TO DO SO. OTHERS ALSO SOME OUR FORTHCOMING TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE ON THAT AND WE'VE HAD SOME OF COLLABORATION ON THE DROPS THERE AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO THAT. IN THE AYE H. ASSESS PROGRAM. ITEM FIVE IN THE AGENDA A WE PROPOSE DE A NEW METHODOLOGY HERE AGAIN IS SPENT A LOT OF INTENSIVE COLLABORATION WITH THE COUNTY WELFARE DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF PUBLIC AUTHORITIES. AND AS STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES. ON. DATA IS COMPLICATED. WE CONTINUE TO MEET WITH THEM. NOW TO DISCUSS THE DATA USED UNDERLYING THE METHODOLOGY. WE OF COURSE FEEL CONFIDENT IN WHAT WE WE HAVE PROVIDED BUT. ALSO OPEN TO OTHER OPINIONS I THINK OUR NEXT MEETING WE'RE TRYING TO SCHEDULE IS FOR THIS FRIDAY. REALIZING THAT'S A LITTLE BIT DIFFICULT FOR THE TIMING OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE. ON BUT WE THINK WE'RE LARGELY THERE THE DIFFERENCE THAT REMAINS IS IS RELATIVELY MINOR. ALTHOUGH IMPORTANT. FILE ITEM SIX IS. AB EIGHTY FIVE SAVINGS. WITH THE EXPANSION OF A CA A CREATED A LOCAL SAVINGS FOR INDIGENT HEALTH CARE THIS IS A JUST ROUTINE ADJUSTMENT TO THAT THE FUNDING ASSUMPTIONS. BEHIND THE VARIOUS FUND SOURCES FOR THAT PROGRAM. THE NEXT COUPLE OF ITEMS ARE ARE ALL RELATED TO THE CONTINUUM OF CARE REFORM WHICH IS CALIFORNIA'S. REFORM TO THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM THAT WE'VE BEEN. UNDER WAY. ON SINCE AT TWENTY ELEVEN. THEY'RE A COUPLE ITEMS HERE. A RESOURCE FAMILY APPROVAL THIS IS THE PROCESS THAT WE USED TO APPROVE HOME SAYS PLACEMENTS FOR PEOPLE. IT'S NEW IT'S DIFFICULT FOLKS ARE LEARNING. AND WE'VE DEVELOPED A BACKLOG IN THE APPROVAL PROCESS THERE WE'VE PROVIDED A AS STATED IN THE AGENDA. NEARLY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. TO ADDRESS THAT BACKLOG ON A ONE TIME BASIS A TICK. TO TO RESOLVE THAT AND WE DON'T WANT IMPEDIMENTS TO PLACEMENTS TO OCCUR. IT IT ITEM EIGHT. KIT CAREGIVER ASSISTANCE PAYMENTS. WE'RE CONTINUING TO WORK ON TRAILER BILL FOR THIS PROPOSAL AS WELL YOU MAY RECALL IN THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR WE PASSED A WITH THE LEGISLATURE URGENCY LEGISLATION A AB ONE TANNED. A TO PROVIDE ASSISTANCE TO FAMILIES. TYPICALLY ARE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR FEDERAL FUNDING UNTIL YOUR HOME HAS BEEN APPROVED AND BECAUSE OF THE LENGTHY APPROVAL PROCESS FAMILIES WERE BEING ASKED TO TAKE CARE OF CHILDREN OF FOR SEVERAL MONTHS AT A TIME WITHOUT PAYMENT. THAT PROOF OF SHORT TERM SOLUTION EXPIRES JUNE THIRTY AND SO WE'RE PROPOSING. TO CONTINUE A METHOD TO ENSURE THAT PAYMENTS CAN BE MATT. GOING FORWARD THROUGH BUDGET YEAR AND ON GOING THIS IS WHAT WE CALL THE LONG TERM SOLUTION. THE LOOK OF CARE ASSESSMENT TOOL THIS IS THE CHILD ASSESSMENT THAT HELPS. IDENTIFIED THE RATE THAT'S APPROPRIATE TO MEET THE. KAREN SUPERVISION NEEDS OF THE CHILD. AND IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS IS A NEW ACTIVITY AND WE'RE PROPOSING A COMBINATION OF FUN SOURCES IN IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF THREE MILLION DOLLARS FOR IMPLEMENTATION AND COUNTY USE OF THAT TOOL. ITEM TEN REFLECTS. AT AN ADJUSTMENT TO THE A TRANSFER OF CHILDREN FOR AN YOUTH FROM GRUPOM SETTINGS TO HOME BASE FAMILY CARE SETTINGS. AND THIS. IS. CASE I WOULD CONSIDER THIS A CASELOAD UPDATE AND AN IMPORTANT. TO NOTE. IT'S BASED ON THE MOST RECENT DATA AND EXPERIENCE THAT WE HAVE THOSE TRANSITIONS ARE GOING SLOWER THAN WE HAD PLANNED. WHAT WE'RE DOING IS NEW AND DIFFICULT AND WITH THE DELAY IN APPROVAL OF HOMES THAT OBVIOUSLY IMPACTS THE ABILITY TO TAKE CHILDREN FROM CONGREGATE KAREN AND PUT THEM IN A HOME BASE FAMILY CARE SETTINGS? SO THAT THAT'S A MOVING SLOWER. AS WELL THE SPECIALIZED CARE INCREMENTING ITEM ELEVEN. IN ADDITION TO THE RATE PAID BY THE STATE COUNTY WELFARE AGENCIES. ALSO PROVIDE HISTORICALLY A SPECIALIZED CARE INCREMENTAL BY OF THE RATE WHEN THE NEEDS OF THE CHILD INDICATE. THAT THAT ADDITIONAL RESOURCES ARE NEEDED FUNDING FOR THAT WAS REALIGNED AND IN RECOGNITION OF THE NEW RATE STRUCTURE UNDER THE CONTINUUM OF CARE REFORM. COUNTY PLANS A ARE ACTUALLY SUBMIT I THINK THEY WERE DO YESTERDAY TO THE DEPARTMENT OF REFLECTING ADJUSTMENTS TO THEIR SPECIALIZED CARE INCREMENT POLICIES. ARE GOING FORWARD AND SO. WE'VE ADJUSTED THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ASSUMPTION ABOUT ANY OFFSETS TO THOSE SPECIALIZED CARE INCREMENTS. ON ITEM TWELVE THIS IS AT A TRIBAL ISSUE AT THE REQUEST OF SOME TRIBES WE HAVE TWO TRIBES IN CALIFORNIA. THAT HAVE EXISTING OF FEDERAL A TITLE FOR E. AGREEMENTS THIS ALLOWS THEM TO DRAW. A OPERATE THEIR OWN CHILD WELFARE PROGRAMS AT THE TRIBAL LEVEL RATHER THAN VIA THE COUNTY. AND WITH ANYTHING DO IT'S A LITTLE BIT DIFFICULT TO START UP AND NOT ALL OF THE STAFF COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THOSE STARTUP ACTIVITIES. ARE NECESSARILY CLAIM MOBILE AGAINST A PARTICULAR CHILD WELFARE CASE AND SO. AT WHERE YOU ARE PROPOSING. MY MINOR AMOUNT OF FUNDING TO PROVIDE START UP FOR THEM TO PAY THEIR STAFF TO GET THEIR PROGRAMS UP AND RUNNING. ON AT THE LAST ITEM ON PAGE SEVENTEEN THERE ARE A NUMBER OF PROGRAMS THAT ARE LISTED ON PAGE EIGHTEEN. INCLUDING THE. FOSTER PARENT RETENTION RECRUITMENT AND SUPPORT PROGRAM CHILD AND FAMILY TEAMING CASE RECORD REVIEWS. A COMMERCIALLY SEXUALLY EXPLOITED CHILDREN'S PROGRAM FOR WHICH WE'RE PROPOSING TO TO A RE APPROPRIATE AN EXPANDED PRIOR YEAR FUNDING THAT WAS APPROPRIATED FOR THOSE PROGRAMS. NON. AND THE LAST ISSUE ON PAGE. AND IT'S NOT THE LAST ISSUE SORRY. OF THE. THE ISSUE AT THE TOP OF PAGE NINETEEN AS DISASTER ASSISTANCE. IN A DISASTER OUR DEPARTMENT HAS RESPONSIBILITY FOR MASS KAREN SHELTER OBLIGATIONS THE FIRST RECOURSE FOR PEOPLE IMPACTED BY DISASTERS IS TO GO THROUGH THE FEMALE PROCESS. BUT TO THE EXTENT THAT THEY'VE EXHAUSTED WHAT FEMA HOUSE TO OFFER THE STATE HAS A SUPPLEMENTAL A GRANT PROGRAM THAT PROVIDES UP TO TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS. TO FURTHER MEET THOSE NEEDS WE'VE PAID APPROXIMATELY TWO HUNDRED CASES AS A RESULT OF WILDFIRES AND OTHER ACTIVITIES THIS YEAR. AND REQUESTED A MINOR AMOUNT OF FUNDING. TO. PAY FOR THE COST OF THOSE GRANTS. THE TRAILER BILL PROPOSALS IN ADDITION TO THOSE THAT WERE MENTIONED. IN MY EARLIER COMMENTS HOME BASED FAMILY RATES. FOUR FAMILIES WITH PLACEMENTS BETWEEN AT TWENTY ELEVEN AND TWENTY SIXTEEN FOR. ADOPTION ASSISTANCE CAN GAP BAND AND NON RELATED LEGAL GUARDIANS. A WE WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT THE RATES THOSE FAMILIES ARE ELIGIBLE FOR IS THE RATE THAT WAS AT IN EXISTENCE AT THE TIME THE PLACEMENT WAS AGREED UPON. AND NOT THE NEW HOME BASED FAMILY CARE RATE. THAT'S A CONSISTENT WITH PAST PRACTICE IN THE PROGRAM AND THAT'S WHAT THIS LANGUAGE DOES I HEAR IF THERE'S A CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES ON THE CHILD IS REASSESSED AND THEY HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO ASSESS THE HIGHER RATE. BUT THE BUDGET DOES NOT INCLUDE FUNDING TO RETROACTIVELY INCREASED THE RATE SYDNEY'S PLACEMENT TYPES BACK FIVE YEARS. ROOM AND SAID THAT THIS IS AN IMPORTANT PIECE OF TRAILER DAHLE FOR. BECAUSE STAYING WITHIN. APPROPRIATED RESOURCES. AND THEN ITEM SIXTEEN IS EXACTLY IS TITLED ITS FEDERAL COMPLIANCE WITH THE RULE MAKING THAT WAS DONE IN AN HOUR RICK AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL REGARDING THE INDIAN CHILD WELFARE ACT AND IN CUSTODY PROCEEDINGS CLARIFYING THE ROLE OF TRIBES IN THOSE PROCEEDINGS. ON. WE UNDERSTAND THAT DUE TO THE NATURE OF THAT THE BUDGET DEVELOPMENT PROCESS TRIBES HAVE NOT YET HAD A CHANCE TO SEE THAT AND. LANGUAGE AND KIND. AND. CONFIRMED THAT IT MEETS THEIR NEEDS ABOUT THAT CONSULTATION IT IS HAPPENING I IN MEETINGS ARE BEGINNING TODAY. ON AND WE DON'T THINK THEY'LL FIND. SUBSTANTIAL CONCERNS WITH THAT LANGUAGE. I WILL CEASE DOT THERE WITH THOSE BUT IF I COULD MAKE ONE GENERAL REMARKS FOR THE RECORD ACROSS EVERYTHING HEARD IN THE SUBCOMMITTEE. DUE TO THE NUMBER OF. PROPOSALS IN FRONT OF THE COMMITTEE THIS YEAR. WHAT ONCE DECISIONS BECOME A LITTLE BIT MORE CLEAR AROUND WHAT THE PACKAGE LOOKS LIKE WE'D LIKE TO REQUEST THAT THE COMMITTEE ALLOW US TO ENGAGE WITH STAFF AND BRING FORWARD A PROPOSAL? DEBTS CONSOLIDATED AND REPRESENTATIVE OF THE STATE OPERATIONS NEEDS TO EFFECTUATE A NUMBER OF THESE PROGRAMS THERE'S A LOT OF NEW CONTRACTS RATE ADJUSTMENTS CONSULTATION THAT HAS TO HAPPEN THERE'S A VARIETY OF HOUSING PROPOSALS FOR EXAMPLE. AND IT'S DIFFICULT TO ANALYZE THE STATE OPS NEEDS FOR EACH AND EVERY ONE OF THOSE BUT IF WE KNOW THERE ARE THREE OR FOUR IN A SUBJECT AREA WE'D LIKE TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO REVISIT STATE OPERATIONS. IE STAFF FOR THE DEPARTMENT TO MAKE THESE THINGS HAPPEN NEGOTIATE THAT THANK YOU THANK YOU DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE LA A. GOOD MORNING CHAD ALAMO WITH THE LA JOH WE COVERED A LOT OF MATERIAL JUST AND SO WILL KIND OF GO BACK AND FORTH AS WE. AS WE HIT OUR OUR TOPICS. REGARDING THAT THE COW WORKS CASELOAD ADJUSTMENTS FOR THE MAY REVISE OUR OFFICE HAS REVIEWED THE ADMINISTRATION'S UPDATED NUMBERS ON AND IN FACT HAVE VERY SIMILAR CASE OF FORECASTS OURSELVES WE THINK THEY'RE REASONABLE. THAT THE BIGGEST CHANGE. FROM GOVERNOR'S BUDGET MAY REVISE IN THE CAO WORKS PROGRAM IS THE NEW METHODOLOGY THAT'S USED IN THE SINGLE ALLOCATION FOR THE ELIGIBILITY COMPONENT. ON THE WORD JUST BEGINNING OUR REVIEW OF THE METHODOLOGY WE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE DEPARTMENT ON AS WELL THE PART OF FINANCE AND COUNTY STAKEHOLDER SPENT CONSIDERABLE TIME. THIS LAST YEAR ON PUTTING TOGETHER A NEW METHODOLOGY THE PRELIMINARY LOOK SUGGEST THAT IT'S GOING TO BE AN IMPROVEMENT OVER PAST PRACTICE I'M WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE ADMINISTRATION THE LEARN MORE ABOUT THAT. MOVING ONTO THAT THE TO HOUSING PROPOSALS THAT THAT REPRESENT. TO PORTIONS OF THE GOVERNOR'S HOMELESSNESS PACKAGE OUT THERE EXPANSION OF EXISTING PROGRAMS AND THE COWARDS PROGRAM AND AND TO OUR OFFICE SEEM REASONABLE. OF. MOVING ALONG AT A. WITH REGARDS TO THE I JUST AS PROGRAM THE MAIN DRIVERS FOR THAT BASS ADJUSTMENTS A ROUTE FROM MAY REVISE RELATIVE TO THE JANUARY HAVE TO DO WITH HIGHER HOURS PER CASE HIGHER PROVIDER COSTS AND HIGHER OVERTIME COSTS. I'M WE RECEIVE SOME BACKUP FROM THE DEPARTMENT YESTERDAY AND ARE CONTINUING TO REVIEW THE DATA BUT AT THIS TIME REYES NO CONCERNS WITH THOSE ADJUSTMENTS WITH REGARDS TO THAT I JUST SAYS THAT ADMIN COSTS. COMPONENT IT'S OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT THAT WAS MAINLY AN ADJUSTMENT TO REFLECT NEW ASSUMPTIONS AROUND BENEFIT COSTS. AND. OVERHEAD COSTS AT THE COUNTY LEVEL AS THE DEPARTMENT NOTED THERE CONTINUED CONVERSATIONS TO LOOK AT THE METHODOLOGY AND IT'S OUR UNDERSTANDING IN JANUARY THE ADMINISTRATION DID SAY THAT AS A PART OF THEIR TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE. BUDGET THAT THEY WOULD ALSO BE REVIEWING THAT THE METHODOLOGY AND TO ENSURE THAT TO THE EXTENT THAT ANY OTHER ADDITIONAL CHANGES NEED TO BE MADE THAT THE REFLECTED. AND JUST BRIEFLY THANK YOU FOR. REGARDING THE AB EIGHTY FIVE SAVINGS ESTIMATE REVISIONS IN THE MAY REVISE. LIKE APARTMENTS AT THIS REPRESENTS INCREASED. OFFSETTING SAVINGS. RESULTING FROM INDIGENT CARE SAVINGS RELATES THE A CA ARM WHICH HAD THE EFFECT OF REDUCING GENERAL FUND COSTS FOR THE CAO WORKS PROGRAM OUT WE'RE CONTINUING TO WORK WITH A PARTNER FINANCE TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE DYNAMICS OF THAT UPDATED. I ESTIMATE BUT BUT SO FAR IT SEEMS TOTALLY REASONABLE TO. BEN JOHNSON WITH THE LA SHOW. HERE ON ITEM SEVEN OF THE RFA BACKLOG FUNDING. DO THINK IT MAKES SENSE IN CONCEPT OF PROVIDE ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO CLEAR BACKLOGS WE DID RAISE QUESTIONS IN OUR. INITIAL COMMENTS ON THAT. GOVERNOR'S MAY REVISION PROPOSAL THAT THE CASELOAD ESTIMATE. OR THAT BACKLOG ESTIMATE. DIFFERED IN THE MAY REVISION AS OPPOSED TO PREVIOUS DATA THAT WE HAD SEEN FROM THE DEPARTMENT OUR SUBSEQUENT UNDERSTANDING. AFTER WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT IS THAT. THE FUNDING IS ONLY TO ADDRESS A A PORTION OF THE EXISTING BACKLOG NAMELY THE. FOSTER CARE GIVERS WITH WHOM CHILDREN ARE ALREADY PLACED ON AN EMERGENCY BASIS SO IT WOULD NOT ADDRESS THE BACKLOG FOR SAY A NEW FOSTER CARE GIVER THAT'S YOU KNOW COMING TO COMING INTO THE PROGRAM AND AND WOULD LIKE TO HAVE A FOSTER CHILD. UNRELATED SAY. INTO THEIR HOME AND SO THAT BACKPACK LOG COULD CONTINUE TO EXIST AND COULD CONTINUE TO. STYMIE SOME OF THE EFFORTS TO INCREASE THE AVAILABILITY OF HOME BASE PLACEMENTS. I'M ON ITEM EIGHT A WE DO. WELCOME THE CONCEPT OF FUNDING FOR. PAYMENTS AT THE TIME OF PLACEMENT AS PROPOSED BY THE GOVERNOR WE HAVE NOT SEEN THE TRAILER BILL YET HOWEVER I AND WILL REVIEW AND PROVIDE ANY COMMENTS AS WE SEE A AS WE SEE THE A THE TRAILER BILL. ON LOC. DO WE WE RAISE THIS IN OUR JANUARY ANALYSIS THAT DOES SOME FUNDING COULD BE NECESSARY IN ORDER TO MEET OUR PROP THIRTY OBLIGATIONS. AND SO WERE LOKING AT THE FUNDING ABOUT AND SO FORTH AND EVALUATING THAT AND I'M. BUT ARE ALSO ASKING THE DEPARTMENT ON THE CANS ASSESSMENT THAT IS NEWLY GONNA BE REQUIRED UNDER IT SHE SEE ARE. WHETHER OR NOT. FUNDING FOR THAT ISRAELI ADEQUATELY SORT OF SUBSUMED IN FUNDING THAT THE. THAT THE STATE RD PROVIDE STAY COUNTY WELFARE DEPARTMENTS BOTH IN THE FORM OF REALIGNMENT FUNDING SO THE CASE PLANNING ACTIVE ACT ACTIVITIES FUNDING THAT WOULD STATUS PROVIDED SINCE TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN AS WELL AS. NEW FUNDING FOR CHILD FAMILY TEAMS OR JUST WORKING TO SEE HOW THOSE NUMBERS COP TO MAKE SURE THAT THE STATE THAT IS ADEQUATELY FUNDING IT'S IT'S PROP THIRTY OBLIGATIONS. WE DO NOTE IN OUR. IN OUR RIGHT UP THAT THE ON ITEM TEN ACTUALLY I'LL JUST SAY ITEMS TEN AND ELEVEN THAT DATA A NEW BUDGET DOES REFLECT UPDATED CASELOAD PROJECTIONS. WHICH DOES RESULT IN HIGHER GENERAL FUND FUND COSTA OF I THINK A LOT OF THOSE END UP IN THE IN THE BUDGET YEAR SO SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN PREVIOUSLY ESTIMATED. AND THAT THE SEC AT THAT SPECIALIZED KAREN COMMIT SAVINGS ADJUSTMENT APPROPRIATELY REMOVED FROM TWENTY SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN SINCE WE REALLY DON'T THINK ANY A ADJUSTMENTS WELL. UP UP THERE ARE IT'S UNLIKELY THAT MAJOR ADJUSTMENTS WILL BE OCCURRING IN THE ESSAY I IN IN THE CURRENT YEAR. WE DO THINK THAT THERE IS SOME RISK THAT THERE COULD BE SOME UNDER FUNDING IN THE BUDGET YEAR SHOULD REDUCTIONS IN SPECIALIZED CARE AMPLE IN INCREMENTS NOT OCCUR AS QUICKLY AS US DOOMED AS THE DEPARTMENT. ASSUMING AND WE ARE LOOKING INTO THE ESTIMATE METHODOLOGY AND THERE'S. TO SEE IF THERE IS SOME RISK THAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY OVERESTIMATING SAVINGS WHICH COULD RESULT IN A ULTIMATELY IN HIGHER COSTS OUT IN THE BUDGET YEAR WHICH WOULD. ULTIMATELY HAVE TO BE PAID BY THE STATE SO. WE DON'T RAISE ANY OTHER CONCERNS ON THE. ON THE OTHER PROPOSALS HERE ON THE CHILD WELFARE SIDE. THANK YOU. WE WILL NOT TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE THREE ANY. PORTION OF THIS PLEASE JUST IDENTIFIES SO THAT. WE KNOW WHICH ISSUE WHERE SECTION HEARD DISCUSSED. CAN KESSLER WITH CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF PUBLIC AUTHORITIES ON ITEM FIVE WHICH IS THE COMBINATION OF COUNTY AD MAN AND PUBLIC AUTHORITY AD MAN WE WERE VERY CONCERNED. IN WHERE PUBLIC AUTHORITIES HAVE LANDED WHEN THE STATE COUNTY FINANCIAL RELATIONSHIP CHANGED UNDER THE NEW MOE WE LOST OVER A QUARTER OF THE ADMIN DOLLARS. FOR PUBLIC AUTHORITIES THE ADMINISTRATION HAS BEEN WORKING VERY HARD WITH US SINCE JANUARY TO CONSTRUCT A NEW BUDGET WORKLOAD FORMULA AND THIS FOR US WAS BRAND NEW TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW MANY STAFF IT TAKES. TO FULFILL OUR MANDATES TO PROJECT NUMBER ONE WAS TO IDENTIFY THE THINGS AND STATUTES THAT WE THE PUBLIC AUTHORITIES HAVE TO DO OUR MANDATES AND TO SEPARATE TAT FROM. COUNTY MANDATES I MENTION THAT BECAUSE THERE ARE A NUMBER OF COUNTIES THAT HAVE THEIR PUBLIC AUTHORITIES TO PROVIDER ENROLLMENT SOME THAT HAVE THEIR PUBLIC AUTHORITIES HANDLE PAYROLL. THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT WHERE WE HAVE COME OUT IN THIS IS HARDLY UNUSUAL FOR YOU TO HEAR IS AN ABSOLUTELY FAIR WAYTO FUND PUBLIC AUTHORITIES WE APPRECIATE THE MAY REVISED EDITION OF ONE POINT FIVE MILLION. WE THINK THAT THEIR FORMULA IS INTELLECTUAL FARE AND THAT THEIR PROCESS WAS TRANSPARENT. SO IN TERMS OF OUR PUBLIC AUTHORITY MANDATES WE CAME OUT IN A VERY OKAY PLACE SO LONG AS YOU APPROVE THE MAY REVISE ON THE COUNTY ADMIN SIGN I JUST DECIDED WANTED TO SAY THAT. THAT TO THE EXTENT THAT THE COUNTIES HAVE CONCERNS ON THE ADEQUACY OF THEIR FUNDING IT AFFECTS THEIR CAPACITY TO BEN CONTRACT WITH THE PUBLIC AUTHORITIES FOR THINGS LIKE PROVIDER ENROLLMENT AND SO FORTH. THAT'S REALLY MORRISSEY SAKON CW DE A ISSUE BUT I WON'T LET YOU KNOW THAT THERE IS AN INTERPLAY SO AGAIN OUR THANKS TO THE ADMINISTRATION THEY'VE REALLY BEEN SOLID PARTNERS. ARM AND OUT AND URGE YOUR SUPPORT FOR THE MAY REVISE THANK YOU MA'AM AND I'M JUST GONNA PAUSE PUBLIC COMMENT JUST FOR A SECOND SO THAT WE CAN ESTABLISH A QUORUM. DOCTOR ARAMBULA PRESENT HARPER. MATHIS RUBIO HERE. DOCTOR WOULD. QUORUM. THANK YOU. CHAIR MEMBERS ROBERT HARRIS ON BEHALF SEIU CALIFORNIA. WE APPRECIATE THE COUNTY. ADMIN WORK THE SPEND ON WE THINK IT'S INCOMPLETE BECAUSE IT DOESN'T ALLOW. FOR THE TRUE COST OF THE SOCIAL WORKERS WHO ACTUALLY ARE THAT MOST. SOME OF THE HIGHER PAID AND MORE SKILLED SOCIAL WORKERS WHO DO THIS. AND WHEN WHEN THAT DOESN'T FACTORY INCORRECTLY BENNETT LOOK PUTS PRESSURE DOWNWARD PRESSURE. FIRST FROM THE COUNTIES AND TO THE PUBLIC AUTHORITIES. THEN TO HAVE IT. THAT I JUST ASK WORKERS AND THEN ULTIMATELY ON THE RECIPIENTS OF THE SERVICES. WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT SO JOE WE THINK THAT WE'RE GLAD TO HEAR THEY'RE WORKING ON ON COMING UP WITH A BETTER ESTIMATE? THE OTHER THING THAT'S MISSING IN THE END THIS IS ACOSTA LIVING IF YOU DON'T DO A COCA COLA. AND NEXT YEAR IT ENDS UP BEYOND. THAT DOWNWARD PRESSURE AGAIN AND AND WE THINK THAT'S JUST WRONG AND WE THINK THAT THE DEPARTMENT AND THE COUNTIES CAN ACTUALLY COME UP WITH THE REAL COST OF WHAT A SOCIAL WORKER COSTS IN THIS AREA. AND THEN COME UP WITH A SLIGHTLY INCREASED THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT WILL. REACH ACCURATELY REFLECT THE TRUE COSTS OF DOING THE ADMINSTRATION THANK YOU THANK YOU SIR. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR FRANK MECCA EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR THE COUNTY WELFARE DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION FIRST I WANNA SAY THAT WE'RE IN SUPPORT OF AN VERY THANKFUL FOR THE HOUSING RELATED. AUGMENTATION SUMMIT SENT LETTERS INTO THE COMMITTEE TO THAT EFFECT WE'RE VERY PLEASED THAT THAT GOVERNOR INCLUDED THAT FUNDING IN THE MAY REVISION. WE ALSO APPRECIATE THE ENGAGEMENT WITH THE DEPARTMENT ON A NUMBER OF IMPORTANT OUT BUDGETING METHODOLOGIES FOR OUR MINISTRY OF WORK ASSOCIATED WITH CCR WITH I JUST AS SOME WITH CAL WORKS. WE'VE BEEN WORKING IN VERY GOOD FAITH WITH THE ADMINISTRATION TO TRY TO TRUE THOSE UP TO WHAT IT ACTUALLY COST TO DO THOSE JOBS. THERE ARE A HANDFUL OF ISSUES THAT YOU'VE HEARD ALREADY TODAY WHERE WE DO TAKE EXCEPTION TO THE MAY REVISE AND WOULD LIKE TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE LEGISLATURE. I'M WITH RESPECT TO THE CAL WORK SINGLE ALLOCATION AND WE HAD A TERRIFIC ENGAGEMENT TO SORT OF TRUE UP. WHAT IT COST TO DO THE ELIGIBILITY PORTION OF THE CAL WORKS PROGRAM AND WE WE HAVE ACTUALLY NO CONCERNS WITH WHERE THAT LANDED? WHAT HAPPENED THOSE BETWEEN JANUARY AND MAY THERE WAS A FURTHER CASELOAD REDUCTION THAT WAS TAKEN? ASSOCIATED WITH THE EMPLOYMENT SERVICES WHICH IS THE NEXT COMPONENT THAT WE'RE TACKLING WITH THE STATE TO TRUE UP. WHAT WE'RE ASKING IS THAT IN THE MEANTIME UNTIL WE CAN FIGURE OUT A BETTER METHODOLOGY FOR EMPLOYMENT SERVICES WE NOT FURTHER TAKE A CUT OF ABOUT TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS? WHICH WOULD BE ON TOP OF ALMOST THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN THE PRIOR. TWO AND A HALF YEARS SO WE BASICALLY WANT TO STOP THE BLEEDING. AND BE HELD HARMLESS UNTIL WE CONTROL UP THE EMPLOYMENT SERVICES METHODOLOGY. WITH RESPECT TO I JUST AS ADMINISTRATION WE SIMILARLY HAVE A. A POSITION IN THAT WE CAME TO AN AGREEMENT ON HOW MUCH WORK IS IT TO DO I ASSESS THERE'S NO DISAGREEMENT WITH THE ADMINISTRATION AND. THE QUESTION THAT WE'RE STILL TALKING ABOUT RIGHT NOW IS. HOW MUCH IS AN HOUR OF SOCIAL WORK COST IT'S AN EMPIRICAL QUESTION IT'S NOT A THING THAT WERE? SPECULATING ON BUT THERE'S A A METHODOLOGY THAT ADMINISTRATION USED WHICH WAS TO GO TO COUNTY WEBSITES AND LOOK AT PUBLISHED SALARY RANGES AND PICKED A MIDPOINT. AND ASSUME THAT THAT'S KIND OF WHAT. PEOPLE SHOULD BE GETTING IN THAT REGION. AND WE POLL DATA THAT FROM ACTUAL COUNTY COSTS WHICH WE THINK IS A SUPERIOR METHODOLOGY. THERE SOME REFINEMENTS THAT THE ADMINISTRATION WAS I'M ASKING FOR IS AS LATE AS LAST NIGHT'S WE'RE GONNA KEEP. WORKING WITH THEM. BUT WE BELIEVE OUR METHODOLOGY SIGNIFICANTLY CLOSER TO REALITY BECAUSE IT'S THE REAL COST THAT WE REPORT ON CLAIMS THAT ARE SUBMITTED TO THE STATE AND AUDITED BY THE STATE PURSUANT TO A FEDERALLY MANDATED COST ALLOCATION PROCESS. AND WE THINK YOU SHOULD DEFER TO THE ACTUAL AND NOT THE PROXIES WITH RESPECT TO THAT CONTINUOUS CARE REFORM. ON. WE WOULD JUST UNDERSCORE SOME OF THE ISSUES RAISED BY MISTER JOHNSON. FROM THE ALEJO WE BELIEVE THAT EXCLUDING. BACK LIKE CASES WHERE THERE IS NOT IN EXISTING CHILD. WE SHOULD BE ABOUT RE EXAMINED WE HAVE FOR EXAMPLE RELATIVES AWAITING APPROVAL WHO COULD BE TAKING THEIR CAN. CORPS IN THE BACKLOG AND SO WE THINK IT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE TO FUND THE ENTIRE BACK RIDE. BACKLOG NOT JUST A SUBSET THAT WAS FUNDED IN THE MAY REVISION. I AM WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT. WITH RESPECT TO THE LEVEL OF CARE ASSESSMENT. AND CANS THERE'S ACTUALLY SIGNIFICANTLY MORE WORK FOR OUR WORKERS THAN REFLECTED IN THAT IN THE MAY REVISION THERE ARE SOME TIONS FOR EXAMPLE. WITH CANS WHICH ISN'T A MAJOR A ASSESSMENT. THAT IT WILL REPLACE NOT BE IN ADDITION TO ASSESSMENTS THAT THE COUNTIES ARE DOING CURRENTLY SO THE THE MAY REVISE SAYS HEY WE THINK THAT'S A WASH. I'M WE DON'T BELIEVES THAT WE PROVIDED AN ANALYSIS THAT CROSSWALKS CURRENT REQUIREMENTS TO THE NEW REQUIREMENTS THAT SHOWS THE GAP FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE WE UNDERSTAND THE ADMINISTRATION. HASN'T DONE THAT THAT SAME ANALYSIS BUT IT'S WORKING ON IT BUT WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE IT. ARMED BECAUSE OUR WORKERS AND OUR MEMBERS ARE TELLING US THAT IT IS SIGNIFICANTLY MORE WORK. THAN CURRENT LAW AND FINALLY WITH PAYMENT AT THE TIME OF PLACEMENT NONE OF US HAVE HAD SEEN THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE BUT I'D LIKE TO PUT A MARKER AND. WE ABSOLUTELY BELIEVE THAT PROVIDER SHOULD GET STARK AND PAID FROM THE MINUTE THEY GET A CHILD THERE'S NO DISPUTE ABOUT THAT. AB ONE TEN WAS A TERRIFIC TEMPORARY COMPROMISE BUT IT EXPIRES AND WHAT'S GOING IN ITS PLACES AS WE UNDERSTAND IT SOMETHING VERY DIFFERENT. ARMED THERE WOULD BE NO STATE GENERAL FUND CONTRIBUTION AND IT WOULD BE A HUNDRED PERCENT COUNTY RESPONSIBILITY. TO PAY THROUGH EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE TNF IT'S THE FUNDING SOURCE. ARM AND THE COUNTIES WOULD HAVE TO PICK UP TO THIRTY PERCENT NON FEDERAL COST. DAY STATE GENERAL FUND COST THAT THEY WERE PUTTING IN UNDER THE AB ONE TEN SOLUTION THE MAY REVISE PULLS OUT. AS WE UNDERSTAND IT THE MAY REVISE ALSO SAYS THAT IF YOU'RE A FAMILY AND YOU ARE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR E. A. ANY COULD BE A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF FAMILIES WHERE YOU'VE EXPIRED. I'M YOU'VE YOU'VE USED UP HERE E. A YOU ARE NOT ELIGIBLE AS WE UNDERSTAND IT THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL FOR PAYMENT AT THE TIME OF PLACEMENT. WE DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY REASON TO EXCLUDE SOME SUBSET OF THE POPULATION FROM THE PRINCIPLE THAT FROM THE MOMENT YOU TAKE A CHILD. YOU SHOULD BE GETTING SUPPORTED FOR THAT CHILD AND SELL WHEN THEN WHEN THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE COMES OUT WE WOULD CERTAINLY LIKE TO ENGAGE. THE COMMITTEE IN THE ADMINISTRATION ON SOME OF THE THOSE CONCERNS AS WELL THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR. STEPPED ARE. MISTER CHAIR MY CAROL WITH THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY MEMBERS ALSO I'M HERE ON TWO ON TWO ISSUES ONE IS WE'D LIKE TO SAYS HERE ARE COMMENTS. WITH THOSE TO MISTER MAC FROM THE WALL FOR DIRECTORS ON THE SINGLE ALLOCATION A WHILE WE'RE PLEASED THAT THERE HAS BEEN A DETERMINATION ON THE ELIGIBILITY. FORMULA WE STILL ARE CONCERNED TOO ABOUT EMPLOYMENT SERVICES AND LOOK FORWARD TO SOLVING THAT GOING FORWARD AND HOPEFULLY. PROTECTING THE COUNTIES BECAUSE THAT IS REALLY WHAT THE PROGRAM IS ABOUT IT'S ABOUT GETTING THOSE EMPLOYMENT SERVICES TO OUR CLIENTS SO THAT THEY CAN YOU KNOW GET THROUGH THE PROCESS TO GET OFF WELFARE AND. GET A JOB. I ALSO WANT TO TALK BRIEFLY ABOUT THE THREE HOUSING PROPOSALS WE ARE IN SUPPORT OF ALL THREE OF THESE AUGMENTATIONS WE HAVE BEEN BIG ADVOCATES OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS. FOR INCREASING THE DAILY ALLOWANCE FOR THE HOMELESS ASSISTANCE PROGRAM WE THINK IS A VERY IMPORTANT STEP ARM TO POINT THAT WE WOULD JUST MAKE ONE IS. THAT WHILE WE ARE VERY PLEASED TO SEE THE STATE. ARM OF AND TAKING SPECIFIC DIRECT ACTION AROUND TRYING TO SOLVE SOME OF THE HOMELESS PROBLEMS THAT ARE FIVE FAMILIES HAVING THE COWARDS PROGRAM. ON THAT WE WE DO WORRY A LITTLE BIT THAT. BUT THE FAMILIES FRANKLY DON'T KNOW ABOUT THESE PROGRAMS AND THEY'RE NOT REALLY CLEAR HOW TO USE THEM I THINK ONE THING THE COMMITTEE. MAY WANT TO CONSIDER GOING FORWARD IS LOOKING AT HOW THESE PROGRAMS DO FUNCTION TOGETHER AND THE DEGREE TO WHICH THEY MAY BE ABLE BE MORE STREAMLINED AND EFFECTIVE. WHEN WE SPOT WE TALK TO CLIENTS ALL THE TIME AND WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THIS THEY REALLY DON'T KNOW HOW YOU WORK HAVE WITH. A JUST P. OR WITH FAMILY MAINTENANCE THE FAMILY STABILIZATION EXCUSE ME SO I THINK GOING FORWARD WE NEED TO BE THINKING ABOUT HOW WE DO THAT. AND THEN LASTLY I WOULD JUST SAY THAT. THE CONTINUING NEED FOR HOMELESS ASSISTANCE IS ALSO A REFLECTION OF THE INADEQUACY OF OUR GRANT LEVELS INVOLVE CAO WORKS AND THE SSI PROGRAM WE ALSO ARE SUPPORTING THE HOME SAFE PROPOSAL WE THINK THAT'S. WELL I A VERY IMPORTANT PROPOSAL BUT WE ALSO THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT WE REYES SSI GRANTS TO GET MORE INCOME INTO THE HANDS OF THOSE FAMILIES TO SO I DON'T WANT THAT THAT POINT TO BE LOST IN THE TIME COMES. WE'RE HOPING THE COMMITTEE CAN TAKE ACTION IN THOSE AREAS ALSO THANK YOU THANK YOU SIR. JUSTIN GARRETT I CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES A LOT TO COMMENT ON SAW TEND TO GROUP MY COMMENTS TOGETHER. ON ITEMS NUMBER ONE IN FIVE WITH THE COUNTY ADMINISTRATION FUNDING WE GENUINELY APPRECIATE THE PARTNERSHIP OF THE COLLABORATION WITH THE DEPARTMENTS IN TERMS OF. THE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE WITH IDENTIFYING THE ACCURATE COST SOME FOR COUNTIES TO ADMINISTER THESE PROGRAMS AND WE SHARE THE. THAT THE COUPLE OF REMAINING CONCERNS AT CW HAS IDENTIFIED IN TERMS OF BEING ABLE TO HOLD COUNTIES HARMLESS TO THE LEVEL FUNDING FOR THE SINKS IN THE ALLOCATION. AND THEY'VE BEEN ABLE TO ENSURE THAT ACTUAL COST IT IS UTILIZED IN THE ICE AS ADMIN METHODOLOGY. FOR ITEMS TWO THREE AND FOUR WE ARE SUPPORTIVE OF ALL OF THAT. INVESTMENTS IN. PROGRAMS TO ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS AND AND WE APPRECIATE THAT. IMITATION PRIORITIZE IN THIS ISSUE. FOR ITEMS SEVEN AND NINE RELATED TO A COUNTY WORKLOAD WITH C. C. R. IMPLEMENTATION WE APPRECIATE THE ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR BOTH OUR F. A. N. ELSIE I'M WE CONTINUE TO BELIEVE THAT THERE IS ADDITIONAL. AYE COUNTY WORKLOAD IS NOT YET ADEQUATELY AFFRONT FUNDED INCLUDING ON THE KANSAS HARASSMENT AND SO WOULD. ALSO ADVOCATE FOR ADDITIONAL FUNDING THERE TO REFLECT ACTUAL COSTS. AND THEN FINALLY ON THE ISSUE OF CCR PAYMENTS AT TIME OF PLACEMENT. I'M WE DEFINITELY SHARE THE SUPPORT FOR IDENTIFYING A LONG TERM SOLUTION ON THIS CRITICAL ISSUE AND IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT THESE FAMILIES ARE. ARE BEING PAID AT THE TIME THAT THEY'RE CARING FOR CHILDREN AND WE WOULD SHARE THE CONCERNS THOUGH ABOUT THE INCREASE COUNTY COSTS AND WHAT WE UNDERSTAND TO BE IN THIS PROPOSAL. AND WANTING TO WORK TOGETHER WITH THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE AND ENSURE THAT THAT'S ADDRESSED A HOME FOR THE LONG TERM SOLUTION ON THIS THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR. MISTER CHAIR DRAWING OF OR SOME BEHALF URBAN COUNTIES OF CALIFORNIA I'M REGARDING THE COW WORKS HOUSING SUPPORT HOMELESS ASSISTANCE WHICH ARE PART OF THE GOVERNORS ARE HOMELESS PACKAGE. WE HAVE A SUPPORTING CONCEPT ON THE ENTIRE PACKAGE WE DON'T HAVE ANY CONCERNS WITH THE CAL WORKS ON HOUSING SIDE OF IT. IT'S ACTUALLY IN THE ON THE HOUSING SP TWO AND AND THE BRANCH A GRANT THAT WE ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT ON ALLOCATIONS WHICH UNDERSTANDS CAN BE DEALT WITH IN SUB FOUR SIGISMUND TO HIGHLIGHT THAT FOR YOU. NUMBER ALSO IN SUPPORT OF THE ADDITIONAL INCREASES TO THE AYE JUSTICE COUNTY AD MAN IN THE CCR BUT OFFICE AIRLINER COMMENTS WITH YOU ZUBIATE OTHERS REGARDING THE FAIRNESS OF METHODOLOGY THANK YOU. THANK YOU MA'AM. GOOD MORNING INTEREST FOR ITS UP WITH THE ALLIANCE FOR CHILDREN'S RIGHTS I'M SPEAKING TO ITEM NUMBER EIGHT THE CAREGIVER EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE AND WE ALSO APPLAUD THE EFFORTS THAT WENT INTO THE SHORT TERM SOLUTION THROUGH AB ONE TAD ARE VERY APPRECIATIVE. THAT A LONG TERM SOLUTION IS BEING WORKED OUT THROUGH OF THE BUDGET PROCESS BUT IT IS OUR FAMILIES THAT HAVE BEEN BEARING THE BRUNT OF THE REFORMS IN THE LEARNING CURVE. AS THE STATE IN COUNTIES WORK THROUGH HOW TO GET FAMILIES APPROVED IN A TIMELY MANNER IT'S OUR FAMILIES THAT HAVE BEEN HOLDING THE BAG AND IT APPEARS THAT WHAT'S BEING PROPOSED THROUGH MAY REVISE. IS GOING TO CONTINUE TO PUT MANY OF THESE FAMILIES IN THE LURCH BECAUSE THERE ARE FOUR THINGS THAT NEED TO BE FIXED THROUGH THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE THAT THE LONG TERM SOLUTION. ACTUALLY WORKS FOR ALL OF THE FAMILIES THAT TAKEN A CHILD PRIOR TO BEING APPROVED THE FIRST IS THAT THERE HAS TO BE FUNDING FROM THE MOMENT A PLACEMENT. ALL THE WAY THROUGH TO APPROVAL AND IT APPEARS THAT THE SHORT TERM OR THE LONG TERM SOLUTION IS LIMITING FUNDING TO SIX MONTHS IN THIS FISCAL YEAR AND NINETY DAYS IN SUBSEQUENT FISCAL YEARS. AND IT IS NOT POSSIBLE ALWAYS TO GET FAMILIES THROUGH THE APPROVAL PROCESS WITHIN SIX MONTHS WE KNOW THERE ARE MANY MANY FAMILIES RIGHT NOW. THAT HAVE BEEN PENDING FOR MUCH LONGER THAN SIX MONTHS SO THE SOLUTION HAS TO ACCOUNT FOR THOSE FAMILIES WHO THE ENTIRE PERIOD OF TIME. IT ALSO NEEDS TO BE AT THE MOMENT A PLACEMENT WHICH EVERYONE KEEPS SAYING BUT WHAT ACTUALLY HAS BEEN IN THE SHORT TERM SOLUTION AND PROPOSED IN THE LONG TERM SOLUTION. IS THAT THE FUNDING IS TIED TO THE APPLICATION OF THE RK APPLICATION SOMETIMES FAMILIES ARE PROVIDED THOSE APPLICATIONS RIGHT AWAY EVEN WHEN THEY ASK FOR THEM ARE OFTEN NOT PROVIDED THE APPLICATIONS ARE FAMILIES DON'T HAVE CONTROL. OVER WHETHER OR NOT THE APPLICATIONS ARE SUBMITTED AND SO SAYING THAT THE FUNDING DOESN'T START UNTIL THE COUNTIES GET THOSE APPLICATIONS AND AGAIN JUST LEAVES THE FAMILIES THE ONES. THAT ARE BEARING THE PRICE OF THESE REFORMS. AND THERE HAS TO BE CONTINUITY BETWEEN THE SHORT TERM SOLUTION AND THE LONG TERM SOLUTIONS OFFER MOVING AWAY FROM THE ART PROGRAM FOR FUNDING FAMILIES AND PUTTING ALL OF THE FAMILIES INTO THE E. A PROGRAM WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT FAMILIES AREN'T. LEFT IN THE LURCH AS A TRANSITION FROM ARC OVER TO MISTER MECCA SPOKE TO E. A ISN'T GOING TO COVER ALL OF OUR FAMILIES. NOT EVERY FAMILY IS GOING TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR E. A ARE UNDOCUMENTED YOUTH ARE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE CHILDREN WITH INCOME OF THEIR OWN AREN'T ELIGIBLE FOR EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE. AND KIDS THAT HAVE BEEN IN CARE FOR MORE THAN TWELVE MONTHS ARE OFTEN NOT GOING TO BE ELIGIBLE AND THOSE CHILDREN ALSO NEED TO BE FUNDED AT THE MOMENT A PLACEMENT THANK YOU. A HUMAN. SUZANNE ANATHEMA CHILDREN NOW ALSO HERE WITH CONCERNS ON WHAT WE'RE HEARING ABOUT FUNDING AT THE TIMETHE PLACEMENT VERY CHALLENGING TO SPEAK WE HAVEN'T YET SEEN TBL WE HOPE THAT'S COMING OUT SOON. BUT IN THE ABSENCE OF THAT AGAIN SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE HEARD AND DON'T REALLY JIVE WITH WHAT WE ALL AGREED TO ILL AND THIS SPRING AND WHAT THIS LEGISLATURE VERY THOUGHTFULLY HELPED US COLLABORATING GET TO A GOOD PLACE ON. WRESTLING THAT THE LEGISLATURE ONCE AGAIN STEP THEN AND HELPED NEGOTIATE A BETTER AGREEMENT THIS CAN'T BE A FIGHT BETWEEN STAYING COUNTIES OVER WHO PAYS WE NEED TO REMEMBER IT'S ABOUT FAMILIES. MAKING SURE THAT THEY GET FUNDING AT THE TIME THE PLACEMENT AND THAT THAT CONTINUES UNTIL THE APPLICATIONS ARE DONE. THANK YOU MA'AM.

LOS ANGELES COUNTY IS RAISING THAT IS A PROBLEM AREA OF OF NEED AND THE MANY CHANGES FOR SPECIFICALLY FOR THE MAGNITUDE OF. THAT LOS ANGELES COUNTY HAS BEEN PLACED AND THE LACK OF FUNDING TO IMPLEMENT THIS ADMINISTRATIVELY AND IT SHOWS WITH THE NUMBERS. ON THE HARDSHIP THAT'S BEEN PLACED ON THE COUNTY TO BE ABE TO DO THIS WE UTILIZE FIRST FUNDING TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE PAYMENT AT THE TIME OF PLACEMENT. WE SAW THE URGENCY IN THE NEED FOR A FAMILIES TO HAVE THAT AND SO WE ARE VERY SUPPORTIVE AND THANKFUL FOR AB ONE TEN WOULD LIKE TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH YOU. ON TO SEE HOW WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT THAT PAYMENT AND NOT. A PLACE THAT BURDEN ON COUNTIES THANK YOU PICKING UP. HI CELINA PRIOR WITH ASCII YOU WE WOULD LIKE TO ALIGN OUR COMMENTS WITH MR MECCA'S COMMENTS IN REGARD TO SINGLE ALLOCATION AND CC ORANGES ADDS THAT. ARE MEMBERS OF OUR EMPLOYMENT SERVICE WORKERS AND SOCIAL WORKERS WE ARE COMMITTED TO THE WORK THAT WE DO BUT WE CANNOT DO THE WORK WITHOUT ADEQUATE RESOURCES THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE THREE. SEEING NONE ALL BRING IT UP TO THE COMMITTEE AND I HAVE A FEW COMMENTS IF I MAY. AND I WANTED TO START WITH SOME THANK YOUS I. SIGNIFICANTLY APPRECIATE WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION DID. ATTEMPTING TO ADDRESS A CHRONIC PROBLEM FOR OUR STATE AND HOMELESSNESS. BOTH OF THE PROGRAMS AND CAL WORKS ARE MUCH NEEDED AND ARE ANXIOUS. ADDITIONALLY THE HOME SAFE PROGRAM THAT WAS FUNDED IS ONE THAT. SPOKE TO MANY OF US ON THIS COMMITTEE AND ARE QUITE PLEASED TO SUPPORT THE ADMINISTRATION AND PURSUING. I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE FIXED PURSES VARIABLE COST DISCUSSIONS THAT WERE ADDRESSING THAT THE COW WORK SINGLE ALLOCATION I THINK. WHILE IT'S NOT IDEAL YET IT'S A SIGNIFICANT STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION AND WANT TO APPRECIATE THE WORK THAT THE DEPARTMENT HAS DONE. TO HELP WITH THAT. IN ADDITION I WANTED TO THANK YOU FOR THE PAYMENT AT THE TIME OF PLACEMENT. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US AS A STATE TO PUT OUR VALUES FIRST. ON THIS ISSUE AND WANT TO CONTINUE TO SEE AS WE LOOK TOWARDS A LONG TERM SOLUTION. HOW WE AS A STATE ARE MORE MODELING AFTER AB ONE TEN? THAT WE MAKE SURE WE HAVE OUR RESPONSIBILITIES AS A STATE AND PLACE OUR VALUES FIRST AND FOREMOST. WANTED TO COMMENT IF I COULD ON A FEW OF THE OTHER ISSUES THAT WERE TOUCHED ON. ONE THAT IS THAT CURRENTLY SPEAKING TO ME AND THIS ONE I'M GOING TO WANT TO. SPEAK TO THE. DEPARTMENTS ABOUT IS REGARDING CANS FOR CC ARE. I HAVE SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS ABOUT ITS USE AS A TOOL. AND WOULD LIKE TO BETTER UNDERSTAND IF WE AS A STATE ARE EXPOSING OURSELVES TO SIGNIFICANT COST. WHY WE HAVE SELECTED THAT TOOL AND IS THAT THE RIGHT ONE? WHAT WE ARE GOING TO WANT TO LOOK AT IS WHETHER OR NOT THERE'S A PHASE AND POSSIBILITY? COULD WE AS A STATE POTENTIALLY. THAT EMPLOYMENT AND LOOK AT WHETHER THIS IS THE APPROPRIATE TO ON HOW WE WOULD DO THAT I WILL LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOUR TEAM. WE HAVE SOME POTENTIAL IDEAS WE'D LIKE TO PROPOSE. BUT HAVE SOME CONCERNS THAT IT DOES AND WILL REQUIRE ADDITIONAL FUNDS. AND THAT THOSE ACTUAL COSTS WILL BE BORNE BY THE STATE AND WANTS TO ENSURE THAT. WE HAVE SELECTED THE RIGHT TOOL FOR THE RIGHT PLACES LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU ON THAT. I'M REGARDING THE. ISSUE SEVEN OF THE RFA BACKLOG. I WOULD ECHO THE COMMENTS THAT. WHY WE AREN'T? TRYING TO FIX THE ENTIRE BACKLOG. SO THAT WE CAN PLACE AS MANY FAMILIES AS POSSIBLE AND. WOOD LOOKS TO ASK THE DEPARTMENT AGAIN WHY BIT FOCUSED ON A SECTION OF IT RATHER THAN THE ENTIRETY OF THE BACKLOG AND WHAT THE REASONING WAS BEHIND THAT. SO THAT WILL BE A QUESTION. AND THEN FINALLY REGARDING THE LEVEL OF CARE ASSESSMENT ISSUE NINE. WANTED TO. GET AN UNDERSTANDING IT SEEMS THAT THE COUNTIES AND CWD A ARE. BOTH SAYING THAT THE. RFA BACKLOG IN THE LEVEL OF CARE HAVE NOT. THAT ARE THERE NOT ENOUGH. AND I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE METHODOLOGY BEHIND WHY THOSE NUMBERS WERE SELECTED AND WHETHER IT. ADEQUATELY ADDRESSES. THE NEEDS THAT WE HAVE. BUT I HAVE. PITCHER BANKER WITH THE DEPARTMENT AGAIN. LET LET ME START FIRST WITH THE A RESOURCE FAMILY APPROVAL BACKLOG ON THEM. WE TAILOR DE WE RECOGNIZE THAT THE EFFORT HERE IS ON GOING THERE IS A BASELINE OF FINDING FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF THE RESOURCE FAMILY APPROVAL PROCESS. NOT ALL COUNTIES HAVE FULLY EXPANDED DOT AND THEY CONTINUE TO TO WORK ON THAT. DID THIS INVESTMENT IS TARGETED PIT SPECIFICALLY TO THE BACKLOG AND SPECIFICALLY TO THE BACKLOG WHERE PLACEMENTS ACTUALLY EXIST NOW. BECAUSE WE THINK THAT'S THE FIRST PRIORITY FOR WHERE ATTENTION SHOULD BE FOCUSED. THAT'S NOT TO SAY THAT WE DON'T STILL NEED RESOURCE FAMILIES TO BE APPROVED SO THAT THEY'RE AVAILABLE FOR FOR CHILDREN. THAT NEED THAT PLACEMENT. BUT WHEN THERE ISN'T AN ACTIVE CHILD THERE OR IT'S NOT UNNECESSARILY A PLACE THAT'S ACTIVELY UNDER CONSIDERATION WE THINK THAT'S A LOWER PRIORITY THAN WHERE CHILDREN ARE TODAY AND THAT'S THE. THE RATIONALE GENERALLY SPEAKING FOR FOR WHY WE TARGETED THAT PIECE OF THE BACKLOG SO IT SOUNDS AS IF YOU'RE SAYING THERE'S LOW HANGING FRUIT THAT. WE SHOULD BE ADDRESSING FIRST AND FOREMOST. I GUESS THE QUESTION I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND IS. DOES THE REMAINDER OF THE BACKLOG INHIBIT PLACEMENT OF FOSTER KIDS NOW. AND WHAT IT. BENEFIT US IS A STATE TO TAKE CARE OF THE ENTIRE BACKLOG. I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THAT I THINK EIGHT IN ADDITION TO THIS INVESTMENT AS I MENTIONED THERE'S A BASELINE LEVEL OF FUNDING FOR RESOURCE FAMILIES. AND. APPROVAL PROCESS SEES AND I THINK THE COMBINATION OF THE TWO. DIMINISHING THIS PART OF THE BACKLOG AYE I WOULD SAYIS THAT THE HIGH HANGING MOST OF THE HIGH PRIORITY. FRUIT IF YOU WILL. AND THAT THE BASELINE LEVEL OF FUNDING WE BELIEVE IS IS ADEQUATE IT'S CONSISTENT WITH WHAT WE'VE PROPOSED A HISTORICALLY AND OTHERS HAVE FOUND ACCEPTABLE WE THINK THE REST OF THE BACKLOG WILL RESOLVE ITSELF OVER TIME. AS EVERYBODY TOGETHER GETS BETTER AT AT THE FAMILY APPROVAL PROCESS SO I I'M. TELLING YOU THAT THE ADMINISTRATION FEELS COMFORTABLE. THAT THE ENTIRE BACKLOG WILL OVER TIME. BE RESOLVED BY BY THE LEVEL OF INVESTMENT. THAT WE BELIEVE HAS AS A ACCURATELY. IN THE BUDGET AND I JUST WANT TO PUT A PIN INTO THE CONVERSATION ABOUT THE LEVEL OF CARE ASSESSMENT AS. I DO NOT UNDERSTAND THIS IS AN ONGOING. ASSESSMENT WILL NEED ADJUSTMENTS THROUGH TIME BUTTON. JUST. ONCE TED ECHO AND MAKE SURE WE'RE BEING RECEPTIVE TO WHAT WE'RE HEARING ON THE GROUND AS WELL. FINALLY REGARDING ISSUE EIGHT. YOU KNOW I'M. EAGERLY ANTICIPATING THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE AS WELL TO REALLY GET AN UNDERSTANDING. THAT BUT WHO. I HAVE CONCERNS IF WERE NOT CREATING THE CONTINUITY OF THE PROGRAM. AND SO AGAIN JUST WANT US TO AS MUCH AS WE CAN TO FOLLOW THE. INTENT OF WHAT A. B. ONE TEN WAS TRYING TO DO AND SEE THAT THIS TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE REFLECTS MORE OF THAT THAN. WHAT WE'RE HEARING HERE TODAY SO? WITH THAT WE WILL HOLD ISSUE THREE OPEN AND MOVE ON TO ISSUE FOR.
