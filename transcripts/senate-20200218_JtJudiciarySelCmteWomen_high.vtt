GENDER FOR SERVICES. AND THAT

00:01:38.097 --> 00:01:39.866
WAS I THINK IN NINETEEN NINETY

00:01:39.933 --> 00:01:42.368
FOUR- SO FAST FORWARD HERE WE

00:01:42.435 --> 00:01:44.237
ARE TWENTY FIVE YEARS LATER SHE

LOOKS NO DIFFERENT AND I'M VERY

00:01:46.072 --> 00:01:48.441
JEALOUS BUT- WE HAVEN'T REALLY

00:01:48.508 --> 00:01:51.211
MOVED TO AS FAR. BEYOND THAT

00:01:51.277 --> 00:01:53.046
LEVEL OF DISCRIMINATION AS WE

00:01:53.112 --> 00:01:55.915
MUST AND SO WITH YOUR DAY TODAY

00:01:55.982 --> 00:01:57.050
TO TAKE A DEEP DIVE INTO THIS

00:01:57.116 --> 00:02:00.186
ISSUE- IT'S- GENDER BASED

00:02:00.253 --> 00:02:01.187
PRICING DISCRIMINATION

00:02:01.254 --> 00:02:02.856
SOMETIMES CALLED THE PINK TAX I

00:02:02.922 --> 00:02:04.591
WANT TO BE CLEAR. THIS IS NOT A

00:02:04.657 --> 00:02:06.726
TAX COLLECTED BY GOVERNMENT

00:02:06.793 --> 00:02:08.695
THIS IS A TAX COLLECTED BY

00:02:08.761 --> 00:02:10.597
COMPANIES. TO ADD TO THEIR

00:02:10.663 --> 00:02:12.832
PROFIT MARGIN AT THE EXPENSE OF

00:02:12.899 --> 00:02:14.834
WOMEN AND FAMILIES IT'S A

00:02:14.901 --> 00:02:16.236
PRACTICE OF CHARGING HIGHER

00:02:16.302 --> 00:02:18.104
PRICES FOR GOODS AND SERVICES

00:02:18.171 --> 00:02:19.772
THAT ARE MARKETED TO WOMEN.

00:02:19.839 --> 00:02:21.541
WHEN THE SAME ESSENTIAL PRODUCT

00:02:21.608 --> 00:02:25.044
OR SERVICES ARE SOLD LESS A TWO

00:02:25.111 --> 00:02:28.248
MAN. SO THIS IS OBVIOUSLY

00:02:28.314 --> 00:02:29.749
SOMETHING OF CONCERN TO THOSE

00:02:29.816 --> 00:02:31.351
OF US WHO ARE OUT THERE IN THE

00:02:31.417 --> 00:02:33.920
MARKETPLACE- BUYING PRODUCTS

00:02:33.987 --> 00:02:35.855
FOR OURSELVES OR OUR CHILDREN.

00:02:35.922 --> 00:02:38.658
OR FAMILIES AND- BASICALLY JUST

00:02:38.725 --> 00:02:40.159
THE BOTTOM LINE IS NOT ONLY IS

00:02:40.226 --> 00:02:42.362
IT BAD ECONOMICALLY BUT IT'S

00:02:42.428 --> 00:02:44.831
WRONG JUST SIMPLY WRONG. AND IT

00:02:44.898 --> 00:02:46.466
SYSTEMATICALLY DEPRIVED WOMEN

00:02:46.533 --> 00:02:48.334
OF EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY

00:02:48.401 --> 00:02:51.004
ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY. AND ALSO

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:53.072
PSYCHOLOGICALLY A WASH WE'D BE

00:02:53.139 --> 00:02:55.208
PAYING MORE FOR RAZORS THAT ARE

00:02:55.275 --> 00:02:57.544
PINK THE MEN PAY FOR THE VERY

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:59.846
SAME RAZOR THAT IS BLACK. OR

00:02:59.913 --> 00:03:01.548
SOME OTHER COLOR WHY SHOULD

00:03:01.614 --> 00:03:03.550
CHILDREN AS WE HAVE HERE IS AN

00:03:03.616 --> 00:03:06.119
EXAMPLE OF TO TEDDY BEARS WE OF

00:03:06.185 --> 00:03:07.487
ALL INSPECTED THEM VERY

00:03:07.554 --> 00:03:09.322
CAREFULLY THEY ARE EXACTLY THE

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:12.592
SAME. EXCEPT AS TO COLOR. THE

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:15.228
PINK ONE IS TWO DOLLARS MORE

00:03:15.295 --> 00:03:18.097
THAN THE BLUE ONE. WHY IS THAT.

00:03:18.164 --> 00:03:19.632
THERE IS NO DECENT EXPLANATION

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:21.467
FOR THAT COM IF THERE IS WE'RE

00:03:21.534 --> 00:03:23.002
CERTAINLY HAPPY TO HEAR IT BUT

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:24.837
THE EXPLANATION REALLY

00:03:24.904 --> 00:03:26.973
OBVIOUSLY IS MORE BASED UPON.

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:28.374
THE PERCEPTION THAT WOMEN ARE

00:03:28.441 --> 00:03:29.609
PREPARED TO AND WILLING TO PAY

00:03:29.676 --> 00:03:31.744
MORE FOR A PRODUCT OF THAT IS

00:03:31.811 --> 00:03:33.079
MARKETED TO THEM IN IN A COLOR

00:03:33.146 --> 00:03:35.982
THAT WOMEN AND CHILDREN- GIRLS

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:38.751
IN PARTICULAR TEND TO PREFER-

00:03:38.818 --> 00:03:40.053
SO WE ARE GOING TO LOOK INTO

00:03:40.119 --> 00:03:41.554
THIS. WE SHOULD NOT BE

00:03:41.621 --> 00:03:43.489
TOLERATING THE CIRCUMSTANCE WE

00:03:43.556 --> 00:03:44.724

ATTENTION FACT THAT SERVICES IN

THE STATE WERE BEING BIASED NOT

00:05:55.455 --> 00:05:57.523
ON THE AMOUNT OF TIME IT TAKES

TO PROVIDE THE SERVICE BUT I

00:05:59.926 --> 00:06:05.798
WHETHER YOU MAY OR FEMALE. SO

00:06:05.865 --> 00:06:07.667
WE WENT OUT OF A BAY CAMPAIGN.

00:06:07.734 --> 00:06:08.835
TAKING WHITE OXFORD SHIRT. TO

THE DRY CLEANER. EXACTLY THE

00:06:09.602 --> 00:06:11.571
SAME. THAT IF IT WAS A WOMAN

00:06:11.637 --> 00:06:13.506
SURE IT IT WAS TWO OR THREE

00:06:13.573 --> 00:06:15.408
DOLLARS MORE. TO LAUNDER THAN A

ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES SO I PAID

00:06:24.751 --> 00:06:26.552
EIGHTY DOLLARS FOR A HAIR CUT.

00:06:26.619 --> 00:06:29.989

00:06:30.056 --> 00:06:32.024
GOVERNOR SCOTT WALKER WHO WENT

00:06:32.091 --> 00:06:33.526

HAIR CUT WELL- WHAT WE

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:40.133
RECOGNIZE WAY BACK IN THE

00:06:40.199 --> 00:06:41.067
NINETEEN NINETIES IS THAT WE

00:06:41.134 --> 00:06:43.302
SHOULD BE BASING THIS ON GENDER

00:06:43.369 --> 00:06:44.570

TAKES. TO LAUNDER A SHIRT OR

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:50.710

BILL PASSED BECAME LAW. AND

00:06:54.647 --> 00:06:55.181
PROVIDES FOR PRIVATE RIGHT OF

ACTION. DURING THE COURSE OF

00:06:57.350 --> 00:06:58.718
THAT LEGISLATION I HAVE THE

00:06:58.785 --> 00:07:00.987
ASSEMBLY OFFICE OF RESEARCH. DO

00:07:01.053 --> 00:07:02.789
I A PROJECT TO EVALUATE HOW

00:07:02.855 --> 00:07:04.457
MUCH IS IT REALLY COSTING WOMEN

00:07:04.524 --> 00:07:07.660
IN CALIFORNIA THIS IS NINETEEN.

00:07:07.727 --> 00:07:08.261
NINETY FOUR TO NINETEEN NINETY

FIFTY ONE DOLLARS MORE PER YEAR.

00:07:15.735 --> 00:07:17.170
FOR WOMEN JUST IN TERMS OF

SERVICES THAT THEY WOULD- BE

00:07:21.507 --> 00:07:24.043
PAYING. AND YOU COUPLE THAT

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:25.845
WITH THE FACT THAT WOMEN ARE

00:07:25.912 --> 00:07:30.449
MAKING LESS. THAN MEN. THE WAGE

00:07:30.516 --> 00:07:32.218
GAP IS STILL ABOUT EIGHTY TWO

00:07:32.285 --> 00:07:33.820
CENTS FOR EVERY DOLLAR EARNED

00:07:33.886 --> 00:07:35.621

IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO

00:09:26.198 --> 00:09:29.635
ADDRESS THIS I GUESS THAT THE

00:09:29.702 --> 00:09:33.072
REAL TOPPER WAS LAST WEEK IN

00:09:33.139 --> 00:09:36.575
TENNESSEE. WHERE TENNESSEE WAS

THEY WOULD INCLUDE TAMPONS. AND

00:09:50.222 --> 00:09:51.223
THEN THEY DECIDED NOT TO

00:09:51.290 --> 00:09:53.626
INCLUDE TAMPONS BECAUSE IT

00:09:53.693 --> 00:09:55.928
WOULD LOSE SO MUCH REVENUE TO

00:09:55.995 --> 00:09:56.529
THE STATE OR THERE'D BE A RUN

00:09:56.595 --> 00:09:58.764

THAT- IN MY WORK IN WASHINGTON.

00:10:11.410 --> 00:10:12.745
WE HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL VERY

00:10:12.812 --> 00:10:14.780
RECENTLY AND GETTING THE

00:10:14.847 --> 00:10:16.148
DEADLINE STRICKEN FROM THE

BEEN PASSED BY THIRTY EIGHT

00:10:19.452 --> 00:10:21.120
STATES. SO IT SHOULD BECOME

00:10:21.187 --> 00:10:23.756
PART OF OUR CONSTITUTION- IT

00:10:23.823 --> 00:10:26.025
NOW IS- SITTING IN THE SENATE

00:10:26.092 --> 00:10:27.960

THE SENATE TO TAKE IT OUT

00:10:30.596 --> 00:10:32.064
BECAUSE WE HAVE THE REQUISITE

00:10:32.131 --> 00:10:34.433
NUMBER OF VOTES TO PASS IT. IF

00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:35.935
GENDER DISCRIMINATION WERE

00:10:36.002 --> 00:10:37.570
PROHIBITED IN THE CONSTITUTION

00:10:37.636 --> 00:10:40.706
ALL OF THESE CASES. WOULD BE

00:10:40.773 --> 00:10:42.341
DEALT WITH BECAUSE YOU COULD

00:10:42.408 --> 00:10:44.844
BRING AN ACTION STATING THAT IT

00:10:44.910 --> 00:10:46.846
WAS UNCONSTITUTIONAL IT IS

00:10:46.912 --> 00:10:47.747
UNCONSTITUTIONAL IT'S

00:10:47.813 --> 00:10:49.982
DISCRIMINATORY AND IT'S TIME

00:10:50.049 --> 00:10:52.351
FOR US TO ADDRESS IT ON EVERY

00:10:52.418 --> 00:10:55.454
LEVEL BUT WOMEN ARE THE BIG.

00:10:55.521 --> 00:10:57.790
CONSUMERS OF PRODUCTS THEY

00:10:57.857 --> 00:11:01.460
PURCHASE ABOUT 7280% OF ALL

00:11:01.527 --> 00:11:03.629
CONSUMABLE PRODUCTS. IN THE

00:11:03.696 --> 00:11:06.499
COUNTRY SO- WE SHOULD.

00:11:06.565 --> 00:11:10.102
RECOGNIZE THAT BECAUSE THEY

00:11:10.169 --> 00:11:11.504
HAVE THE PURCHASING POWER THEY

00:11:11.570 --> 00:11:13.639
ALSO HAVE THE POWER TO SAY THIS

00:11:13.706 --> 00:11:15.241
KIND OF DISCRIMINATION SHOULD

00:11:15.307 --> 00:11:18.444
NOT CONTINUE- AND I THINK WITH

00:11:18.511 --> 00:11:20.112
THAT MISSY FIVE AREA AND

00:11:20.179 --> 00:11:22.048
THOUGHTS THAT I WANTED TO SHARE

00:11:22.114 --> 00:11:25.418
WITH YOU. YOU KNOW THAT WE

00:11:25.484 --> 00:11:26.619
OFTEN SAY THAT THAT THIS KIND

00:11:26.685 --> 00:11:28.187
OF DISCRIMINATION GOES ON FROM

00:11:28.254 --> 00:11:30.289
CRADLE TO GRAVE AND I DIDN'T

00:11:30.356 --> 00:11:31.624
BRING THE SAMPLES BECAUSE THEY

00:11:31.690 --> 00:11:33.559
WERE A LITTLE BULKY FROM

00:11:33.626 --> 00:11:37.730
WASHINGTON BUT- ADULT DIAPERS

00:11:37.797 --> 00:11:40.433
HE WENT INTO A WALGREENS. I

00:11:40.499 --> 00:11:41.734
DON'T THIS WAS MAYBE A FEW

00:11:41.801 --> 00:11:42.868
MONTHS AGO MAYBE THEY'VE

00:11:42.935 --> 00:11:45.504
CHANGED THEIR THEIR PRICING BUT

00:11:45.571 --> 00:11:47.339
IF YOU BOUGHT A WOMAN'S ADULT

00:11:47.406 --> 00:11:49.475
DIAPERS. THEY WERE THE SAME

00:11:49.542 --> 00:11:51.210
PRICE AS THE MAN THE DAHLE

00:11:51.277 --> 00:11:53.112
DIAPERS EXCEPT YOU GOT FOUR

00:11:53.179 --> 00:11:57.883
DIAPERS LESS. THEN THE MEN'S

ADULT DIAPERS SO IT IS FROM

00:11:59.952 --> 00:12:01.954
CRADLE TO GRAVE AND IT'S TIME

00:12:02.021 --> 00:12:02.988
FOR US TO FIX IT WITH THAT

00:12:03.055 --> 00:12:04.924

00:12:15.801 --> 00:12:18.070
INTERESTING VISUAL ALSO THE NEW

00:12:18.137 --> 00:12:20.806

ONESIES MORE EXPENSIVE IF THEY

00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:29.448

VIOLATIONS OF THE LAW THAT.

00:14:02.608 --> 00:14:06.946
MANY SMALL BUSINESSES ARE STILL.

00:14:07.012 --> 00:14:08.047
DISTINGUISHING AND

00:14:08.113 --> 00:14:09.748

THEIR VIOLATING THE LAW BUT-

00:14:26.332 --> 00:14:27.533
DOESN'T SEEM TO BOTHER THEM

00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:28.734
THEY ALSO DON'T WANT TO GIVE ME

00:14:28.801 --> 00:14:30.202
A HAIR CUT. THAT'S PROBABLY

00:14:30.269 --> 00:14:32.204
SMART THE UNITED WHEN FROM THEM

00:14:32.271 --> 00:14:34.106
EITHER BUT OF COURSE WITH HER

00:14:34.173 --> 00:14:35.741

COUNSELS MAYBE. I HOPE SO. BUT

00:14:57.596 --> 00:14:59.999
THE THAT'S THE POOL SINCE THE

00:15:00.065 --> 00:15:01.700
POINT NO NO NO I THINK THAT THE

00:15:01.767 --> 00:15:03.002
BOTTOM LINE IS THAT WHAT WE'RE

00:15:03.068 --> 00:15:05.471
TALKING ABOUT HERE IS PRICING

00:15:05.537 --> 00:15:07.006
THAT'S BASED ON GENDER. AND

00:15:07.072 --> 00:15:08.140
THAT'S WHAT THIS LEGISLATION

00:15:08.207 --> 00:15:09.375
TALKS ABOUT IF THERE'S A

00:15:09.441 --> 00:15:11.277
LEGITIMATE JUSTIFICATION IF THE

00:15:11.343 --> 00:15:13.345
COST OF A PRODUCT OF THAT IS

00:15:13.412 --> 00:15:14.780
GOING INTO SOMETHING THAT WE

00:15:14.847 --> 00:15:16.682
SELL IF THE COSTS THAT PRODUCT

00:15:16.749 --> 00:15:18.250
IS MORE THAN YOU CAN CHARGE

00:15:18.317 --> 00:15:19.718
MORE BUT IF YOU'RE GOING TO

00:15:19.785 --> 00:15:22.121
CHARGE MORE CASSETTES PINK AND

00:15:22.187 --> 00:15:23.889
THAT'S BLACK THAT IS NOT.

00:15:23.956 --> 00:15:25.758
SUFFICIENT JUSTIFICATION AND IF

00:15:25.824 --> 00:15:27.259
YOU LOOK AT THE SAY ARE EXACTLY

00:15:27.326 --> 00:15:29.194

00:15:30.996 --> 00:15:32.665
THE SHOES OF THE SAME THING

00:15:32.731 --> 00:15:34.300
WITH THAT SO MANY OF THESE

00:15:34.366 --> 00:15:36.568
PRODUCTS- SO- SO THE ARGUMENT

00:15:36.635 --> 00:15:38.037
THAT IS GOING TO OPEN A

00:15:38.103 --> 00:15:39.638
FLOODGATE A LITIGATION IS JUST

00:15:39.705 --> 00:15:45.911
NOT ACCURATE- YOU HAVE. IN

00:15:45.978 --> 00:15:48.881
RECENT CON. WE'VE HEARD THAT TO

00:15:48.947 --> 00:15:50.716
US SOME PEOPLE ARGUE THE MARKET

00:15:50.783 --> 00:15:52.551
WILL SOLVE THIS ISSUE SO

00:15:52.618 --> 00:15:53.485
THERE'S NO NEED FOR GOVERNMENT

00:15:53.552 --> 00:15:56.255
INTERVENTION- DID YOU ALSO HEAR

00:15:56.322 --> 00:15:58.257
THOSE ARGUMENTS BACK IN

00:15:58.324 --> 00:15:58.857
NINETEEN NINETY FIVE WHEN YOU

00:15:58.924 --> 00:16:00.693
WERE. A PUSHING THE LEGISLATION

00:16:00.759 --> 00:16:02.194
TO ADDRESS THE PAIN TAX FOR

00:16:02.261 --> 00:16:04.263
SERVICES. AND DO YOU THINK THAT

00:16:04.330 --> 00:16:06.031
THE MARKET HAS IN FACT FIX THAT

00:16:06.098 --> 00:16:07.700
PROBLEM IN THE LAST TWENTY FIVE

00:16:07.766 --> 00:16:09.268
YEARS I THINK THE EVIDENCE-

00:16:09.335 --> 00:16:11.103
SPEAKS FOR ITSELF NOT ONLY HAS

00:16:11.170 --> 00:16:14.073
IT NOT- FIX THE PROBLEM OF THE

00:16:14.139 --> 00:16:16.175
PROBLEM. IN MANY RESPECTS HAS

00:16:16.241 --> 00:16:18.410
BEEN EXACERBATED. AND THAT'S

00:16:18.477 --> 00:16:23.315
BECAUSE- BECAUSE- SELLERS CAN

00:16:23.382 --> 00:16:24.416
GET AWAY THINK THEY CAN GET

00:16:24.483 --> 00:16:26.919
AWAY WITH IT AND TAKE FULL

00:16:26.985 --> 00:16:27.519
ADVANTAGE OF MAXIMIZING THEIR

00:16:27.586 --> 00:16:31.623
PROFITS. SO YOUR BILL IS BEEN

00:16:31.690 --> 00:16:34.993
INTRODUCED IN CONGRESS- YOU ARE

00:16:35.060 --> 00:16:36.862
EXPECTING NEVER HEARING AT WHAT

00:16:36.929 --> 00:16:39.531
POINT. WE THINK WITHIN THE NEXT

00:16:39.598 --> 00:16:41.200
TWO OR THREE MONTHS. AND IS

00:16:41.266 --> 00:16:42.067
THERE ANYTHING WE SHOULD BE

00:16:42.134 --> 00:16:43.669
LOOKING FOR ANYTHING THAT YOU

00:16:43.736 --> 00:16:46.638
CAN SUGGEST- BASED UPON YOUR

00:16:46.705 --> 00:16:49.108
EXPERIENCE AS FAR AS- THIS

00:16:49.174 --> 00:16:50.342
LEGISLATION WE'RE INTRODUCING

00:16:50.409 --> 00:16:52.111
IN CALIFORNIA TO YOU-

00:16:52.177 --> 00:16:53.879
ANTICIPATE TO SIMILAR

00:16:53.946 --> 00:16:55.247
COMPLAINTS TO AS TO WHAT YOU

00:16:55.314 --> 00:16:57.449
HEARD BACK IN. THE NINETEEN

00:16:57.516 --> 00:16:59.151
NINETIES FOR YOUR LEGISLATION

00:16:59.218 --> 00:17:00.652
AND HOW WOULD YOU RESPOND TO

00:17:00.719 --> 00:17:02.988
THAT SO. THERE'S ALWAYS GOING

00:17:03.055 --> 00:17:04.723
TO BE AN ARGUMENT MADE THE

00:17:04.790 --> 00:17:07.960
QUESTION BECOMES IT IS THIS A

00:17:08.026 --> 00:17:10.095
FORMER DISCRIMINATION. IF YOU

00:17:10.162 --> 00:17:11.029
CAN MAKE THE CASE THAT YOU

00:17:11.096 --> 00:17:12.765
POINTED OUT THAT IT TAKES MORE

00:17:12.831 --> 00:17:15.501
TIME TO SELL THAT PAIRED

00:17:15.567 --> 00:17:18.270
TOGETHER OR TO CUT THAT HERE

00:17:18.337 --> 00:17:21.106
THAT IS A LEGITIMATE BASIS BUT

00:17:21.173 --> 00:17:24.810
NOT. SIMPLY BECAUSE IT IS PINK

00:17:24.877 --> 00:17:27.679
OR BLUE SO ON IT AS IT RELATES

00:17:27.746 --> 00:17:29.248
TO MY LEGISLATION IT WOULD MAKE

00:17:29.314 --> 00:17:31.283
THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION-

00:17:31.350 --> 00:17:34.019
THE ARBITER AND IT WOULD BE

00:17:34.086 --> 00:17:36.722
DEEMED TO BE A VIOLATION- UNDER

00:17:36.789 --> 00:17:38.123
THE LAW AS AN UNFAIR OR

00:17:38.190 --> 00:17:40.025
DECEPTIVE PRACTICE. HE WOULD

00:17:40.092 --> 00:17:41.160
ALSO GIVE THE STATE'S

00:17:41.226 --> 00:17:42.628
ATTORNEY'S GENERALS THE

00:17:42.694 --> 00:17:44.062
AUTHORITY TO BRING CIVIL ACTION

00:17:44.129 --> 00:17:45.964
ON BEHALF OF ALL RESIDENTS OF

00:17:46.031 --> 00:17:48.100
THEIR STATE- IN ORDER TO.

00:17:48.167 --> 00:17:50.869
COMPEL COMPLIANCE BUT YOU ONE

00:17:50.936 --> 00:17:51.870

AND THERE ARE PLENTY OF

00:18:00.412 --> 00:18:01.713
EXAMPLES WHEN I WAS HERE WE

00:18:01.780 --> 00:18:04.283
WOULD PASS LEGISLATION AND THEN

00:18:04.349 --> 00:18:05.484
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WOULD

00:18:05.551 --> 00:18:06.752
TAKE NOTICE BECAUSE THEY DON'T

00:18:06.819 --> 00:18:07.986
WANT TO HAVE FIFTY DIFFERENT

00:18:08.053 --> 00:18:12.257
STATE. RULES AND I THINK IF YOU

00:18:12.324 --> 00:18:14.359

00:18:14.426 --> 00:18:16.361

00:18:35.047 --> 00:18:37.783

THERE'S DIFFERENT LEVELS AND

00:21:41.700 --> 00:21:43.602
THE COMPANY THAT SELLS THESE

00:21:43.669 --> 00:21:46.338

QUESTION SENATOR IN SOME CASES

00:22:23.542 --> 00:22:25.677
I THINK IT'S THE MANUFACTURE

00:22:25.744 --> 00:22:26.745
BUT IN SOME CASES IT'S A

00:22:26.812 --> 00:22:28.213
DISTRIBUTOR IN SOME CASES IT'S

00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:29.848
THE RETAILER. BUT THERE ARE

00:22:29.915 --> 00:22:31.883
COMPANIES THAT HAVE- ONLINE

00:22:31.950 --> 00:22:33.685

THEY SELL PRODUCTS ONLINE AND

00:22:43.628 --> 00:22:45.330
THEY MAKE A POINT OF. A

00:22:45.397 --> 00:22:47.299
PROMOTING THEIR PRODUCTS. AS

00:22:47.365 --> 00:22:49.267
NON DISCRIMINATORY SO IF YOU

00:22:52.537 --> 00:22:56.842
PRICE. AND WE WILL BE HEARING

00:22:56.908 --> 00:23:00.412
FROM THE COMPANY. SO YES THAT

00:23:00.479 --> 00:23:03.415
IS SO IT DOES. SOME SOME OF THE

00:23:03.482 --> 00:23:04.983
DETERMINATIONS ARE MADE AT THE

00:23:05.050 --> 00:23:06.084
MANUFACTURING LEVEL SOME OF THE

00:23:06.151 --> 00:23:07.819
DISTRIBUTION LEVEL AND SOME OF

00:23:07.886 --> 00:23:09.955
THE RETAIL LEVEL AND THE BILL

00:23:10.021 --> 00:23:11.923
TRIES TO GET AT THAT THE

00:23:11.990 --> 00:23:14.292
PARTICULAR DECISION MAKER. SO

00:23:14.359 --> 00:23:16.528
IF A MANUFACTURER FOR EXAMPLE-

00:23:16.595 --> 00:23:18.697
ITEMIZE HIS AND CHARGES MORE

00:23:18.764 --> 00:23:20.565
FOR THE PRODUCT AND THEN THAT

00:23:20.632 --> 00:23:22.434
IS ABSORBED GOING FORWARD IT'S

00:23:22.501 --> 00:23:23.769
THE MANUFACTURER THAT WE WOULD

00:23:23.835 --> 00:23:26.204
BE LOOKING TO IF IT COMES TO A

00:23:26.271 --> 00:23:28.807
RETAIL STORE BIG BOX OR AMAZON

00:23:28.874 --> 00:23:30.909
OR SOME ONLINE COMPANY. AND

00:23:30.976 --> 00:23:33.578
THEY JUST DECIDE TO CHARGE MORE

00:23:33.645 --> 00:23:36.181
THE BILL WOULD ADDRESS THEIR

00:23:36.248 --> 00:23:40.552
BEHAVIOR. A SENATOR HILL THANK

00:23:40.619 --> 00:23:41.153
YOU MADAM CHAIR IS THE YOU TO

00:23:41.219 --> 00:23:44.389
MY CONGRESS WHO IS A- ALWAYS

SUCH A OF. A LEADER WHEN IT

00:23:46.491 --> 00:23:48.593
COMES TO. JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING

00:23:48.660 --> 00:23:50.328
IN FACT WHEN I THINK OF IT BUT

00:23:50.395 --> 00:23:51.096
TO BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY

00:23:51.163 --> 00:23:52.798
CONSUMER RIGHTS AND CONSUMER TO

CONSUMER PROTECTION AND

00:23:54.232 --> 00:23:56.001
CERTAINLY THE- THE EQUALITY

00:23:56.067 --> 00:23:58.303
THAT WE ALL WANT AND EXPECT

00:23:58.370 --> 00:24:00.672
FROM- FROM A MARKET PLACE IN

00:24:00.739 --> 00:24:02.374
WERE NOT SEEN THAT I REMEMBER

00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:03.408
IN THE NINETEEN NINETIES WHEN

00:24:03.475 --> 00:24:04.776
YOU HAVE THAT LEGISLATION AND

00:24:04.843 --> 00:24:06.244
WE'RE PUSHING IT. IT WAS HARD

00:24:06.311 --> 00:24:07.913
FOR ME TO BELIEVE AT THE TIME

00:24:07.979 --> 00:24:08.680
THAT YOU COULD GO TO A DRY

00:24:08.747 --> 00:24:11.049
CLEANERS AND YOU KNOW MY WIFE'S

00:24:11.116 --> 00:24:13.118
BLOUSE WOULD BE MORE EXPENSIVE

00:24:13.185 --> 00:24:14.352
THAN MY ALWAYS NEWS OR BUT I

00:24:14.419 --> 00:24:15.253
ALWAYS FELT THERE HAD TO BE A

00:24:15.320 --> 00:24:17.155
REASON FOR IT. BUT WHAT WOULD

00:24:17.222 --> 00:24:18.256
IN IN FOLLOWING UP ON SENATOR

00:24:18.323 --> 00:24:21.393
GRUDGES. QUESTION THIS IS SO

00:24:21.459 --> 00:24:23.061
PERVASIVE FROM WHAT I'VE SEEN

00:24:23.128 --> 00:24:24.996
AND THEN LOOK AT THE NEW YORK

00:24:25.063 --> 00:24:25.964
STUDY THAT WE HAVE A COPY OF.

00:24:26.031 --> 00:24:29.267
IT JUST TOUCHES EVERY AREA. OF

00:24:29.334 --> 00:24:31.369
CONSUMER PRODUCTS AND WHICH

00:24:31.436 --> 00:24:35.807
WOULD STRIKES ME IS. THERE HAS

00:24:35.874 --> 00:24:38.543
TO BE SOME. SOME SOME IN

00:24:38.610 --> 00:24:40.745
LOOKING FOR TO THE OTHER

00:24:40.812 --> 00:24:43.181
MEMBERS OF THE PANEL THERE HAS

00:24:43.248 --> 00:24:44.516
TO BE REAL REAL FOR THIS TO ME

00:24:44.583 --> 00:24:47.219
THE MARKET TO TECHNIQUE SECRET

00:24:47.285 --> 00:24:48.787
THAT THEY KNOW THAT THEY CAN

00:24:48.854 --> 00:24:51.289
GET AWAY WITH IT BY TO EDIT AND

00:24:51.356 --> 00:24:53.291
ONE THAT IT IT WORKS IN THAT

00:24:53.358 --> 00:24:55.360
PEOPLE WILL UNDERSTAND THAT AND

00:24:55.427 --> 00:24:56.628
EXPECT THAT THERE WOULD BE

00:24:56.695 --> 00:24:57.729
DIFFERENT SO I'M I'M TRYING TO

00:24:57.796 --> 00:24:59.197
GET AT THE HEART IN THAT THE-

00:24:59.264 --> 00:25:01.266
THE CORE OF THE ISSUE AND THEN

00:25:01.333 --> 00:25:02.267
AND THEN HOPEFULLY WE CAN

00:25:02.334 --> 00:25:03.902
CORRECT IT FROM THERE AND MOVE

00:25:03.969 --> 00:25:05.237
FORWARD SO I I'M JUST. I'M

00:25:05.303 --> 00:25:07.239
EXCITED TO MOVE FORWARD IN

00:25:07.305 --> 00:25:08.106
SUPPORTING THE BILL IN THE

00:25:08.173 --> 00:25:09.507
LEGISLATION YES SENATOR THERE'S

00:25:09.574 --> 00:25:11.743
A LINE THAT IS USED IN MADISON

00:25:11.810 --> 00:25:14.646
AVENUE THAT SAYS THAT SHRINK IT

00:25:14.713 --> 00:25:16.281
AND PICK IT IN YOU CAN MAKE

00:25:16.348 --> 00:25:18.450
MORE PROFIT. INTEREST FOR THE

00:25:18.516 --> 00:25:20.252
NEXT THAT'S WHERE IT'S COMING

00:25:20.318 --> 00:25:22.254
FROM THANK YOU I THINK THE

00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:25.824
BOTTOM LINE IS STATE CHARGE

00:25:25.891 --> 00:25:28.193
MORE BECAUSE THEY CAN. AND

00:25:28.260 --> 00:25:29.928
HOPEFULLY WE GONNA. MAKE THEM

00:25:29.995 --> 00:25:30.595
MAKE PEOPLE MORE AWARE YOU KNOW

00:25:30.662 --> 00:25:32.097
THEY SHOULD. WITH THE SHORT

00:25:32.163 --> 00:25:34.366
HIKE D. TO FOLLOW PLEDGES. AND

00:25:34.432 --> 00:25:35.634
SO YEARS AGO WHEN I WAS IN THE

00:25:35.700 --> 00:25:37.802
ASSEMBLY. BECAUSE I HAD TAKEN

00:25:37.869 --> 00:25:39.271
MY HUSBAND'S SHIRT TO THE

00:25:39.337 --> 00:25:41.206
CLEANER IN MARCH FOR TO THE

00:25:41.273 --> 00:25:42.941

HUNDRED EIGHTY POUNDS AND I'M

00:25:44.009 --> 00:25:47.646
NOT. AND HE SURE COST A DOLLAR

00:25:47.712 --> 00:25:48.813
AND A QUARTER TO LAUNDER AND

00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:50.749
MINE COST FOUR DOLLARS AND

00:25:50.815 --> 00:25:52.384
SEVENTY FIVE CENTS. AND SO I

00:25:52.450 --> 00:25:53.952
ASKED THEM WHY IN THEIR

00:25:54.019 --> 00:25:56.288
EXPLANATION WAS WELL HIS SHIRT

00:25:56.354 --> 00:25:58.189

REMEMBER AND YOURS BUTTON IN

00:26:02.527 --> 00:26:05.297
THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION. AND THE

00:26:05.363 --> 00:26:07.999
PRESSES THAT WE USE- ARE

00:26:08.066 --> 00:26:08.934
ACCOMMODATE A MAN'S SHIRT BUT

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:10.568
CAN'T ACCOMMODATE A WOMAN'S SO

00:26:10.635 --> 00:26:13.004
WE HAVE TO HAND. IRON A WOMAN

00:26:13.071 --> 00:26:14.873
SHIRT. AND I REMEMBER THEM

00:26:14.940 --> 00:26:16.408
THINKING MY GOODNESS WE PUT A

00:26:16.474 --> 00:26:18.143
MAN ON THE MOON WE CAN'T FIGURE

00:26:18.209 --> 00:26:20.312
OUT HOW TO DO THIS. FAST FOR

TWENTY YEARS LATER IT'S STILL

00:26:20.979 --> 00:26:24.582
THE SAME PROBLEM WHY. BECAUSE

00:26:24.649 --> 00:26:27.118
THEY CAN'T. SO THAT'S ANOTHER.

00:26:27.185 --> 00:26:29.020

SAYING WE REALLY ARE THE

00:27:46.031 --> 00:27:48.133
GUARDIANS FOR THE PUBLIC MANY

00:27:48.199 --> 00:27:49.567
OF MY LEADS PIECES OF

00:27:49.634 --> 00:27:50.869
LEGISLATION ON CONSUMER

00:27:50.935 --> 00:27:52.937
PROTECTION HAD TO DO WITH THE

00:27:53.004 --> 00:27:54.205
FACT THAT I FELT THAT WE WERE

00:27:54.272 --> 00:27:56.641
THEIR GUARDIAN AND IT WAS OUR

00:27:56.708 --> 00:27:59.744
OBLIGATION TO GO WHERE THEY MAY

00:27:59.811 --> 00:28:03.314
NOT SEE A NEED- OR NOT MAY NOT

00:28:03.381 --> 00:28:05.784
BE EDUCATED ABOUT. A PARTICULAR

00:28:05.850 --> 00:28:08.653
ISSUE AND- MAKE SURE THAT WE

00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:11.322
WERE THERE TO PROTECT THEM SO-

00:28:11.389 --> 00:28:12.524
I KNOW YOU WILL DO THE RIGHT

00:28:12.590 --> 00:28:13.892
THING AND I THANK YOU AGAIN FOR

00:28:18.596 --> 00:28:21.866
GREAT WORK WE- THINK WE ALL

00:28:21.933 --> 00:28:26.938
ADMIRED. YOUR POSITIONS. SO

00:28:27.005 --> 00:28:30.875
WITH I'M TO GO BACK AND ADJUST

00:28:30.942 --> 00:28:31.843
TO IT ALSO WOULD MAKE IT COM

00:28:31.910 --> 00:28:34.412
THAT WILL WERE PRO I THINK IS

00:28:34.479 --> 00:28:36.381
AN INTRODUCTION BUT BEING

00:28:36.448 --> 00:28:37.849
COGNIZANT OF THE CONGRESSWOMAN

00:28:37.916 --> 00:28:41.486
SAYS SCHEDULE THAT LET ME JUST

00:28:41.553 --> 00:28:45.423
SAY I WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT

00:28:45.490 --> 00:28:46.291
WERE WE'RE DOING HERE IS. WE

00:28:46.357 --> 00:28:48.493
WANT OUR BILL. IN AND TO

00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:51.129
THRIVE. AS THEY ARE NOW SO THE

00:28:51.196 --> 00:28:54.065
GOAL HERE IS TO ALLOW IN TO

00:28:54.132 --> 00:28:56.534
ENCOURAGE BUSINESSES TO DO SO

00:28:56.601 --> 00:28:58.303
TO MAKE PROFITS CREATE JOBS.

00:28:58.369 --> 00:29:02.006
BUT WHAT WE DON'T WANT IS. WHAT

00:29:02.073 --> 00:29:03.074
I BELIEVE NONE OF US SHOULD

00:29:03.141 --> 00:29:04.375
TOLERATE IS PRICING

00:29:04.442 --> 00:29:06.544
DISCRIMINATION AGAINST WOMEN

00:29:06.611 --> 00:29:08.446
AND GIRLS. THEY SHOULD NOT BE

00:29:08.513 --> 00:29:10.715
DISCRIMINATION AND PRICING AND

00:29:10.782 --> 00:29:11.549
I ALSO WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT

00:29:11.616 --> 00:29:14.018
WHILE- I BELIEVE THE PINK TAX

00:29:14.085 --> 00:29:18.123
IS WRONG. AS I MENTIONED. A I

00:29:18.189 --> 00:29:19.390
AND I THINK EVERYONE ON THIS

00:29:19.457 --> 00:29:20.525
DíAS IS LOOKING FORWARD TO

00:29:20.592 --> 00:29:22.093
HEARING FROM THE BUSINESS

00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:24.629
COMMUNITY. THE BEST WAY TO

00:29:24.696 --> 00:29:26.898
ELIMINATE THAT- THAT WILL BE

00:29:26.965 --> 00:29:28.466
EFFECTIVE SO NOT A WHIT WINDOW

00:29:28.533 --> 00:29:29.801
DRESSING APPROACH BUT SOMETHING

00:29:29.868 --> 00:29:31.803
THAT REALLY IS GOING TO BE FAIR

00:29:31.870 --> 00:29:33.538
TO THE WOMEN AND THE FAMILIES.

00:29:33.605 --> 00:29:35.306
IN OUR STATE AND HOPEFULLY THAT

00:29:35.373 --> 00:29:39.878
THE NATION WILL THEN FOLLOW SO.

00:29:39.944 --> 00:29:40.879
THE GOAL IS TO THINK A- IN

00:29:40.945 --> 00:29:45.783
BROAD TODAY AND- THIS IS NOT.

00:29:45.850 --> 00:29:48.119
JUST THE KIND OF A ROAD HEARING

00:29:48.186 --> 00:29:49.921
I THINK WE'RE LOOKING FOR SOME

00:29:49.988 --> 00:29:51.022
REAL ANSWERS SOME REAL

00:29:51.089 --> 00:29:53.191
DISCUSSION. I AM HOPEFUL THAT

00:29:53.258 --> 00:29:54.759
WE CAN WORK WITH SOME OF THE

00:29:54.826 --> 00:29:56.327
FOLKS WHO HAVE INDICATED. THEIR

00:29:56.394 --> 00:29:58.396
INITIAL STRONG OPPOSITION TO

00:29:58.463 --> 00:30:00.598
THE BILL THAT THE- WILL COME TO

00:30:00.665 --> 00:30:02.500
THE TABLE AND WORK WITH US TO

00:30:02.567 --> 00:30:03.768
COME UP WITH A SOLUTION THAT

00:30:03.835 --> 00:30:05.436
ADDRESSES THAT PROBLEM WHILE AT

00:30:05.503 --> 00:30:06.905
THE SAME TIME. ENCOURAGING

00:30:06.971 --> 00:30:09.674
BUSINESS TO CONTINUE TO

JENNER MARKETING IN STEREO

00:32:31.382 --> 00:32:33.117

CULTURAL CONSEQUENCES FOR MY

REMARKS WILL FOCUS ON THE

00:32:45.029 --> 00:32:46.397

GENDER DIFFERENTIATED PRODUCTS

00:32:49.534 --> 00:32:51.102
AND PRICING. WHY OF THE THINGS

00:32:51.169 --> 00:32:52.036
I FIND IN MY RESEARCH IS THAT

00:32:52.103 --> 00:32:53.338
WHILE THE GENDER MARKETING OF

00:32:53.404 --> 00:32:55.840
TOYS HAS VARIED OVER TIME THIS

00:32:55.907 --> 00:32:56.774
PRACTICE HAS INCREASED

00:32:56.841 --> 00:32:57.975
DRAMATICALLY OVER THE PAST

00:32:58.042 --> 00:33:00.511
SEVERAL DECADES. IN MY ANALYSIS

00:33:00.578 --> 00:33:02.146
OF OVER SEVEN THOUSAND SEARS

00:33:02.213 --> 00:33:03.514
CATALOGUE TôI ADVERTISEMENTS

00:33:03.581 --> 00:33:05.416
THAT SPAN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY

00:33:05.483 --> 00:33:06.984
I FOUND THAT THE MAJORITY OF

00:33:07.051 --> 00:33:08.953
TOYS WERE MARKETED IN A NON

00:33:09.020 --> 00:33:10.021
GENDERED OR GENDER INCLUSIVE

00:33:10.088 --> 00:33:12.190
WAY. EVEN IN THE DECADES ONE

00:33:12.256 --> 00:33:13.691
GENDER MARKETING WAS THE MOST

00:33:13.758 --> 00:33:15.793
PRONOUNCED GENDER TOYS STILL

00:33:15.860 --> 00:33:18.029
ONLY MADE UP AROUND HALF OF THE

00:33:18.096 --> 00:33:20.965
TOYS ADVERTISE IT. IN CONTRAST

00:33:21.032 --> 00:33:21.899
A TWENTY TWELVE STUDY BY

00:33:21.966 --> 00:33:24.268
SOCIOLOGISTS OSTERN MONTHS BACH

00:33:24.335 --> 00:33:26.170
FOUND THAT ALL OF THE TOYS IN

00:33:26.237 --> 00:33:28.339
THE DISNEY ONLINE STORE WERE

00:33:28.406 --> 00:33:29.841
CATEGORIZED BY ENDER. AND

00:33:29.907 --> 00:33:30.608
GENDER DIFFERENT

00:33:30.675 --> 00:33:32.009
DIFFERENTIATION ISN'T JUST A

00:33:32.076 --> 00:33:34.445
FEATURE OF CHILDREN'S TOYS I

00:33:34.512 --> 00:33:34.979
TWENTY NINETEEN STUDY BY

00:33:35.046 --> 00:33:36.547
STANFORD RESEARCHERS FOUND

00:33:36.614 --> 00:33:38.316
EVIDENCE OF EXTENSIVE GENDER

00:33:38.383 --> 00:33:40.651
TYPING AN ADULT PRODUCT MARKETS

00:33:40.718 --> 00:33:43.020
AS WELL. ADDITIONALLY I FIND IN

00:33:43.087 --> 00:33:44.555
MY RESEARCH THAT THE PRACTICE

00:33:44.622 --> 00:33:45.823
OF CREATING SEPARATE GENDER

00:33:45.890 --> 00:33:48.025
CODED VERSIONS OF THE SAME TôI

00:33:48.092 --> 00:33:50.194
ONLY EMERGES AT THE TAIL END OF

00:33:50.261 --> 00:33:52.530
THE TWENTIETH CENTURY. THE

00:33:52.597 --> 00:33:54.132
HISTORICAL VARIATION IN THE

00:33:54.198 --> 00:33:55.266
CHEN OR MARKETING OF TOYS AND

00:33:55.333 --> 00:33:56.934
OTHER PRODUCTS TELLS US THAT

00:33:57.001 --> 00:33:58.736
THESE ITEMS ARE NOT INHERENTLY

00:33:58.803 --> 00:34:00.705
GENDERED. RATHER THE GENDER

00:34:00.772 --> 00:34:02.740
CODING OF PRODUCTS REFLECTS OUR

00:34:02.807 --> 00:34:04.475
CULTURAL BELIEFS AND PRACTICES

00:34:04.542 --> 00:34:05.576
IT ALSO TELLS US THAT

00:34:05.643 --> 00:34:07.378
ALTERNATIVE WAYS OF PRODUCING

00:34:07.445 --> 00:34:09.447
MARKETING AND PRICING PRODUCTS

00:34:09.514 --> 00:34:11.516
IS POSSIBLE. THIS BEGS THE

00:34:11.582 --> 00:34:12.984
QUESTION THEN WHY DO COMPANIES

00:34:13.050 --> 00:34:14.452
DESIGN MARKET AND SOMETIMES

00:34:14.519 --> 00:34:16.087
PRICE PRODUCTS DIFFERENTLY

00:34:16.154 --> 00:34:18.423
ACCORDING TO GENDER. THE GROWTH

00:34:18.489 --> 00:34:19.957
OF MARKET SEGMENTATION AND

00:34:20.024 --> 00:34:21.893
TARGETING MARKETING PRACTICES

00:34:21.959 --> 00:34:23.161
IN PARTICULARLY IN THE LAST

00:34:23.227 --> 00:34:23.995
DECADES OF THE TWENTIETH

00:34:24.061 --> 00:34:25.363
CENTURY A BIG PART OF THIS

00:34:25.430 --> 00:34:27.698
STORY. COMPANIES ARE ALWAYS

00:34:27.765 --> 00:34:29.500
LOOKING TO INCREASE SALES SO

00:34:29.567 --> 00:34:30.968
WHY SOMEONE FAMILY ONE BOTTLE

00:34:31.035 --> 00:34:32.136
OF SHAMPOO WHEN YOU COULD SELL

00:34:32.203 --> 00:34:33.604
EACH MEMBER OF THAT FAMILY

00:34:33.671 --> 00:34:35.873
THEIR OWN BOTTLE. COMPANIES USE

00:34:35.940 --> 00:34:37.308
GENDER TO SEGMENT THE MARKET

00:34:37.375 --> 00:34:38.609
BECAUSE IT'S AN EASILY

00:34:38.676 --> 00:34:40.311
IDENTIFIABLE CHARACTERISTIC

00:34:40.378 --> 00:34:42.280
AROUND WHICH MUCH OF SOCIAL

00:34:42.346 --> 00:34:44.015
LIFE IS ORGANIZED. GENDER

00:34:44.081 --> 00:34:45.750
STEREOTYPES LEE AT THE CORE OF

00:34:45.817 --> 00:34:47.585
MARKET SEGMENTATION AND

00:34:47.652 --> 00:34:49.787
TARGETING STRATEGIES. PRODUCT

00:34:49.854 --> 00:34:52.089
MAKERS OF MARKETERS OFTEN RELY

00:34:52.156 --> 00:34:53.324
HEAVILY ON STEREOTYPES IN THEIR

00:34:53.391 --> 00:34:54.792
ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT WHAT MALES

00:34:54.859 --> 00:34:57.829
AND FEMALES ARE LIKE WHAT THEY

00:34:57.895 --> 00:34:58.396
SHOULD BE LIKE AND WHAT THEY

00:34:58.463 --> 00:35:02.567
WANT. MARKETING PROFESSOR SUSAN

00:35:02.633 --> 00:35:04.168
MARKETING TO DESCRIBE HOW

00:35:04.235 --> 00:35:05.903
COMPANIES USE CHARACTERISTICS

00:35:05.970 --> 00:35:07.605
LIKE GENDER TO MARKET AND IN

00:35:07.672 --> 00:35:09.574
THE PROCESS ACTUALLY CREATE THE

00:35:09.640 --> 00:35:10.908
VERY DIFFERENCES THEY CLAIM TO

00:35:10.975 --> 00:35:12.810
ADDRESS. THE BIG FOR HER PENS

00:35:12.877 --> 00:35:15.079
THAT YOU MAY HAVE HEARD ABOUT

00:35:15.146 --> 00:35:16.881
OUR GREAT EXAMPLE OF THIS HAS A

00:35:16.948 --> 00:35:18.649
SUGGESTED THAT WOMEN SOMEHOW

00:35:18.716 --> 00:35:20.017
HAD FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT

00:35:20.084 --> 00:35:21.152
RATING NEEDS THAN MEN EVEN

00:35:21.219 --> 00:35:22.487
THOUGH MEN AND WOMEN HAVE BEEN

00:35:22.553 --> 00:35:25.389
USING THE SAME TENS. OF

00:35:25.456 --> 00:35:28.926
OVERTIME. I TWO THOUSAND STUDY

00:35:28.993 --> 00:35:30.228
WHICH- GENDER PRICE DIFFERENCE

00:35:30.294 --> 00:35:32.196
AND- FOUND THAT THE- WHICH-

00:35:32.263 --> 00:35:33.831
MOST TO THE CONSTRUCTION OF

00:35:33.898 --> 00:35:34.966
WHAT THE AUTHORS CALL THE

00:35:35.032 --> 00:35:37.201
GENDER ITSELF THINGS LIKE HAIR

00:35:37.268 --> 00:35:37.869
STYLES AND PERSONAL CARE

00:35:37.935 --> 00:35:39.971
PRODUCTS. ARE ALSO THE MOST

00:35:40.037 --> 00:35:42.106
LIKELY TO BE PRICE DIFFERENTLY

00:35:42.173 --> 00:35:44.809
BY GENDER. SOME PRODUCTS ARE

00:35:44.876 --> 00:35:47.044
NOT INHERENTLY GENDERED AS I AM

00:35:47.111 --> 00:35:48.145
ARGUING THAT HOW DID THEY

00:35:48.212 --> 00:35:50.448
BECOME ENGENDERED. COMPANIES

00:35:50.515 --> 00:35:51.315
TYPICALLY HAVE A TARGET

00:35:51.382 --> 00:35:52.817
DEMOGRAPHIC IN MIND WHEN THEY

00:35:52.884 --> 00:35:54.252
CREATE A PRODUCT EVEN IF THE

00:35:54.318 --> 00:35:56.454
PRODUCT ITSELF IS OSTENSIBLY

00:35:56.521 --> 00:35:58.189
GENDER NEUTRAL. THERE ARE

00:35:58.256 --> 00:35:59.357
SEVERAL STRATEGIES THAT THEY

00:35:59.423 --> 00:36:00.658
THEN USED TO GENDER DIFFERENT

00:36:00.725 --> 00:36:02.660
CHEAP PRODUCTS SOMETIMES

00:36:02.727 --> 00:36:04.328
PRODUCTS ARE CHEN EXPLICITLY

00:36:04.395 --> 00:36:07.265
GENDER LABEL FOR EXAMPLE MEN'S

00:36:07.331 --> 00:36:08.733
RAZORS ARE GIRLS SCOOTERS. IN

00:36:08.799 --> 00:36:10.868
OTHER CASES COMPANIES RELY MORE

00:36:10.935 --> 00:36:12.770
IMPLICIT THOUGH OFTEN NO LESS

00:36:12.837 --> 00:36:15.239
OBVIOUS CUES. THESE MAY INCLUDE

00:36:15.306 --> 00:36:16.541
THE PLACEMENT OF PRODUCTS IN

00:36:16.607 --> 00:36:18.876
STORES AND ONLINE PAGES THE USE

00:36:18.943 --> 00:36:20.745
OF A GENDERED MODEL IN PRODUCT

00:36:20.811 --> 00:36:22.380
PACKAGING OR MARKETING AND THE

00:36:22.446 --> 00:36:23.781
USE OF LANGUAGE THAT EVOKES

00:36:23.848 --> 00:36:25.349
GENDER TEREOTYPES IN THE

00:36:25.416 --> 00:36:27.351
PRODUCT PACKAGING OR MARKETING

00:36:27.418 --> 00:36:33.057
WORDS LIKE TOUGH A DELICATE.

00:36:33.124 --> 00:36:34.325
COLOR AS- THE CO PAYING AS

00:36:34.392 --> 00:36:36.027
WE'VE BEEN DISCUSSING. HAS COME

00:36:36.093 --> 00:36:36.627
TO SERVE AS A PRETTY STRONG

00:36:36.694 --> 00:36:40.064
GENDER USE TO DEFINE GEN.

00:36:40.131 --> 00:36:42.066
CONSUMER HOWEVER COUNTRY TO POP

00:36:42.133 --> 00:36:43.134
BELIEF THIS IS A RELATIVELY.

00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:46.704
THAT IN HER RE ON HISTORICAL.

00:36:46.771 --> 00:36:48.739
DOCTOR JOE PALE FOUND THAT THE

00:36:48.806 --> 00:36:51.175

POPULARITY IN THE NINETEEN

00:36:57.815 --> 00:37:00.051
EIGHTIES SIMILARLY I FIND NO

00:37:00.117 --> 00:37:02.320
EVIDENCE OF WHAT PEOPLE HAVE TO

00:37:02.386 --> 00:37:03.354
DEBT THE PINK OF VACATION OF

00:37:03.421 --> 00:37:06.057
GIRLS TOYS IN MY RESEARCH AND

00:37:06.123 --> 00:37:07.792
EMERGING INTO THE NINETEEN

00:37:07.858 --> 00:37:10.328
EIGHTIES. WHILE THE USE OF

00:37:10.394 --> 00:37:11.862
COLOR AND ESPECIALLY BECAUSE A

00:37:11.929 --> 00:37:14.465
GENDER AS HISTORIC REESE AND-

00:37:14.532 --> 00:37:15.733
RECENT STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT

00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:16.867
THE USE OF COLOR INFLUENCES

00:37:16.934 --> 00:37:18.869
BOTH HOW PEOPLE CLASSIFIED THE

00:37:18.936 --> 00:37:21.439
GENDER OF A PRODUCT. WHETHER

00:37:21.505 --> 00:37:23.007
THAT THEY FEEL THAT OUR PRODUCT

00:37:23.074 --> 00:37:25.242
IS APPROPRIATE FOR THEM. THE

00:37:25.309 --> 00:37:26.143
GENDER CATEGORIZATION OF

00:37:26.210 --> 00:37:27.244
MARKETING A PRODUCT IS

00:37:27.311 --> 00:37:28.980
PROBLEMATIC BECAUSE THE GENDER

00:37:29.046 --> 00:37:30.715
STEREOTYPES THAT FORM THE BASIS

00:37:30.781 --> 00:37:31.882
OF THIS PRACTICE ARE ALSO

00:37:31.949 --> 00:37:33.918
DEEPLY IMPLICATED. IN THE

00:37:33.985 --> 00:37:35.753
PROCESS HE'S AT SUSTAIN GENDER

00:37:35.820 --> 00:37:37.822
INEQUALITY IN OUR SOCIETY.

00:37:37.888 --> 00:37:39.056
THERE'S A WEALTH OF RESEARCH IN

00:37:39.123 --> 00:37:40.625
SOCIOLOGY AND PSYCHOLOGY

00:37:40.691 --> 00:37:42.460
LINKING GENDER STEREOTYPES TO

00:37:42.526 --> 00:37:44.562
PERSISTENT SOCIETAL INEQUALITY

00:37:44.629 --> 00:37:45.930
IS LIKE THE GENDER SO I

00:37:45.997 --> 00:37:47.465
CREATION OF OCCUPATIONS AND THE

00:37:47.531 --> 00:37:49.333
GENDER WAGE GAP. THIS RESEARCH

00:37:49.400 --> 00:37:50.901
SHOWS THAT GENDER STEREOTYPES

00:37:50.968 --> 00:37:52.503
CAN HAVE POWERFUL EFFECTS ON

00:37:52.570 --> 00:37:54.672
BEHAVIORAL EXPECTATIONS ON TASK

00:37:54.739 --> 00:37:56.307
PERFORMANCE AND HOW WE EVALUATE

00:37:56.374 --> 00:37:58.275
OURSELVES AND OTHERS. AND

00:37:58.342 --> 00:37:59.477
IMPORTANTLY ONE DOES NOT HAVE

00:37:59.543 --> 00:38:01.078
TO BELIEVE THE STEREOTACTIC FOR

00:38:01.145 --> 00:38:02.980
IT TO HAVE THAT PROFOUND EFFECT

00:38:03.047 --> 00:38:04.348
ALL THAT'S NECESSARY IS TO KNOW

00:38:04.415 --> 00:38:07.151
THAT IT'S OUT THERE AND THE

00:38:07.218 --> 00:38:09.020
OTHERS BELIEVE IT TO BE TRUE.

00:38:09.086 --> 00:38:09.654
GIVEN THE DATA FROM EFFECTS OF

00:38:09.720 --> 00:38:10.888
GENDER STEREOTYPES IT IS

00:38:10.955 --> 00:38:12.356
PARTICULARLY CONCERNING THAT

00:38:12.423 --> 00:38:14.091
THEY BECOME SO DEEPLY WOVEN

00:38:14.158 --> 00:38:15.760
INTO THEIR DESIGN MARKETING AND

00:38:15.826 --> 00:38:17.828
PRICING OF CONTEMPORARY

00:38:17.895 --> 00:38:20.031
CONSUMER PRODUCTS. WHAT THE

00:38:20.097 --> 00:38:21.065
GENDER MARKETING IN DIFFERENT-

00:38:21.132 --> 00:38:22.033
PRICING OF CONSUMER PRODUCTS

00:38:22.099 --> 00:38:23.868
HAS BECOME A SIGNIFICANT

00:38:23.934 --> 00:38:24.802
PROBLEM IN THE TWENTY FIRST

00:38:24.869 --> 00:38:26.671
CENTURY IT IS ONE THAT IS

00:38:26.737 --> 00:38:27.571
NEITHER INEVITABLE NOR

00:38:27.638 --> 00:38:29.240
INTRACTABLE. IN FACT THERE ARE

00:38:29.306 --> 00:38:30.574
SOME SIGNS THAT COMPANIES MAY

00:38:30.641 --> 00:38:31.642
BE SHIFTING BACK TOWARDS MORE

00:38:31.709 --> 00:38:33.144
GENDER NEUTRAL PRODUCT DESIGN

00:38:33.210 --> 00:38:35.012
AND MARKETING AS A RECENT WALL

00:38:35.079 --> 00:38:36.247
STREET JOURNAL ARTICLE ENTITLED

00:38:36.313 --> 00:38:37.281
DOES YOUR REYES ARE NEEDED

00:38:37.348 --> 00:38:39.417
GENDER EXPLAINS COMPANIES ARE

00:38:39.483 --> 00:38:40.317
COMING TO REALIZE GENDER

00:38:40.384 --> 00:38:41.552
DIFFERENTIATED PRODUCTS ARE

00:38:41.619 --> 00:38:43.888
INCREASINGLY AT ODDS WITH WHERE

00:38:43.954 --> 00:38:45.856
CONSUMERS ARE. AND SO I THINK

00:38:45.923 --> 00:38:47.291

HONORED TO BE A CO SPONSORING.

00:39:43.814 --> 00:39:45.950
SB EIGHT SEVENTY THREE- AND AS

00:39:46.016 --> 00:39:47.384
WE'VE HEARD EARLIER THAT

00:39:47.451 --> 00:39:49.286
DESPITE EXISTING LEGISLATION

00:39:49.353 --> 00:39:51.589
IT'S STILL FAR TOO EASY. FOR

00:39:51.655 --> 00:39:53.557
PRODUCTS MARKETED TOWARDS WOMEN

00:39:53.624 --> 00:39:55.593
TO COST MORE. AND CHARGING

00:39:55.659 --> 00:39:57.094
WOMEN FOR ESSENTIALLY THE SAME

00:39:57.161 --> 00:39:58.062
PRODUCTS IS GENDER

00:39:58.129 --> 00:40:01.232
DISCRIMINATION- WHICH IS WHY WE

00:40:01.298 --> 00:40:01.832
AT THE WOMEN'S FOUNDATION OF

00:40:01.899 --> 00:40:03.934
CALIFORNIA- THINK THAT WE NEED

00:40:04.001 --> 00:40:05.703
SENATE BILL EIGHT SEVENTY THREE

00:40:05.770 --> 00:40:07.938
THE PINK TAX. REPEAL ACT. THE

00:40:08.005 --> 00:40:10.307
PINK TAX REPEAL ACT TO RECTIFY

00:40:10.374 --> 00:40:12.076
IS AN INJUSTICE IN OUR MARKET

00:40:12.143 --> 00:40:13.911
PLACE THAT HAS. DRAMATIC

00:40:13.978 --> 00:40:15.412
IMPLICATIONS FOR THE DAY TO DAY

00:40:15.479 --> 00:40:17.515
LIVES AND FINANCIAL FUTURES OF

00:40:17.581 --> 00:40:19.183
WOMEN AND OUR FAMILIES AND

00:40:19.250 --> 00:40:22.253
COMMUNITIES. ACROSS CALIFORNIA.

00:40:22.319 --> 00:40:24.021
IN MY ROLE AS THE CEO OF THE

00:40:24.088 --> 00:40:24.655
WOMEN'S FOUNDATION OF

00:40:24.722 --> 00:40:26.590
CALIFORNIA. THE IMPORTANCE OF

00:40:26.657 --> 00:40:29.226
LEGISLATION- LIKE SB EIGHT

00:40:29.293 --> 00:40:31.295
SEVENTY THREE. THAT WRITES THE

00:40:31.362 --> 00:40:32.930
SCALES OF ECONOMIC AND JUSTICE-

00:40:32.997 --> 00:40:34.932
COULD NOT BE MORE CLEAR OR

00:40:34.999 --> 00:40:36.567
NEEDED- N THISPARTICULAR

00:40:36.634 --> 00:40:38.736
MOMENT. WE LIVE IN A WORLD

00:40:38.803 --> 00:40:42.406
WHERE WOMEN MAKE BETWEEN 7280%

00:40:42.473 --> 00:40:44.341
OF ALL CONSUMER PURCHASES. THAT

00:40:44.408 --> 00:40:46.277
MEANS THAT WOMEN ARE CALLING

00:40:46.343 --> 00:40:47.478
THE SHOTS ABOUT WHAT MAKES IT

00:40:47.545 --> 00:40:48.779
INTO THE SHOPPING CART BUT

00:40:48.846 --> 00:40:50.347
COMES HOME WITH US AND WHAT

00:40:50.414 --> 00:40:52.416
DOESN'T. SO WITH THIS KNOWLEDGE

00:40:52.483 --> 00:40:55.085
MARKETERS HAVE BEEN

00:40:55.152 --> 00:40:57.755
MANIPULATING THE PRICE OF CAN.

00:40:57.822 --> 00:40:59.323
GOODS FOR PROFIT ON BACKS OF

00:40:59.390 --> 00:41:02.193
WOMEN IN OUR EARNED MONEY.

00:41:02.259 --> 00:41:03.160
MARKETERS A BUNCH WITH A PINK

00:41:03.227 --> 00:41:05.963
TAX ADDITIONAL COSTS. FOR BEING

00:41:06.030 --> 00:41:07.598
WOMEN WHICH MEANS THAT HALF OF

00:41:07.665 --> 00:41:09.867
THE POPULATION IS BEING

00:41:09.934 --> 00:41:11.869
SUBJECTED TO AN ADDITIONAL TAX-

00:41:11.936 --> 00:41:13.771
AND SO IF WE THINK ABOUT LET'S

00:41:13.838 --> 00:41:15.739
SAY A MOM AND FRESNO WHO WANTS

00:41:15.806 --> 00:41:17.341
TO BUY A BICYCLE FOR HER ELEVEN

00:41:17.408 --> 00:41:18.976
YEAR OLD DAUGHTER TO RIDE

00:41:19.043 --> 00:41:20.377
AROUND THE NEIGHBORHOOD RIGHT

00:41:20.444 --> 00:41:22.513
NOW IT WOULD BE PERFECTLY LEGAL

00:41:22.580 --> 00:41:24.415
FOR THAT BICYCLE TO COST AS

00:41:24.481 --> 00:41:27.184
MUCH AS 13% MORE BECAUSE IT'S

00:41:27.251 --> 00:41:27.918
PINK AND MARKETED TOWARDS

00:41:27.985 --> 00:41:30.087
GIRLS. THIS KIND OF GENDER

00:41:30.154 --> 00:41:31.589
BASED MANIPULATION OF THE

00:41:31.655 --> 00:41:34.291
MARKET IS UNWARRANTED AND WHEN

00:41:34.358 --> 00:41:35.659
YOU FACTOR IN THE REALITIES OF

00:41:35.726 --> 00:41:37.595
OUR STATES GENDER PAY GAP IT

00:41:37.661 --> 00:41:39.530
BECOMES ALL THE MORE CRITICAL-

00:41:39.597 --> 00:41:42.199
THAT WE PASS AND IMPLEMENT SB

00:41:42.266 --> 00:41:44.168
EIGHT SEVENTY THREE. SO TO PUT

00:41:44.235 --> 00:41:45.903
THIS ANOTHER WAY WHICH IS THAT

00:41:45.970 --> 00:41:48.005
WOMEN EARN LESS AND PAY MORE

00:41:48.072 --> 00:41:49.540
THE PAINFUL TRUTH IS THAT

00:41:49.607 --> 00:41:51.442
LATINO WOMEN IN CALIFORNIA EARN

00:41:51.508 --> 00:41:53.844
ABOUT FORTY ONE CENTS FOR EVERY

00:41:53.911 --> 00:41:55.980
DOLLAR THAT A MAN IS PAID. A

00:41:56.046 --> 00:41:57.047
BLACK WOMAN MIGHT BE TAKING

00:41:57.114 --> 00:41:58.616
HOME SIXTY CENTS ON A WHITE OR

00:41:58.682 --> 00:42:00.384
ASIAN WOMAN WOULD TOP OUT AT

00:42:00.451 --> 00:42:02.519
ABOUT EIGHTY CENTS- AND SO THIS

00:42:02.586 --> 00:42:03.921
MEANS THAT WORKING WOMEN IN

00:42:03.988 --> 00:42:06.457
CALIFORNIA LOSE OUT ON EIGHTY

00:42:06.523 --> 00:42:08.192
SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY

00:42:08.259 --> 00:42:10.060
BECAUSE OF THE GENDER PAY GAP

00:42:10.127 --> 00:42:11.629
THAT'S EIGHTY SEVEN BILLION

00:42:11.695 --> 00:42:14.231
DOLLARS AND TRANSGENDER WOMEN.

00:42:14.298 --> 00:42:16.267
ARE FOUR TIMES MORE LIKELY TO

00:42:16.333 --> 00:42:18.168
LIVE IN POVERTY SINGLE MOTHERS

00:42:18.235 --> 00:42:19.937
IN CALIFORNIA ACCORDING TO THE

00:42:20.004 --> 00:42:21.572
CALIFORNIA WOMEN'S WELL BEING

00:42:21.639 --> 00:42:23.140
INDEX WHICH REPRODUCED WITH THE

00:42:23.207 --> 00:42:24.708
CALIFORNIA BUDGET AND POLICY

00:42:24.775 --> 00:42:27.478
CENTER- SPEND NOT JUST ON TWO

00:42:27.544 --> 00:42:29.280
LINE ITEMS IN THEIR BUDGET- ON

00:42:29.346 --> 00:42:30.981
CHILD CARE AND HOUSING MORE

00:42:31.048 --> 00:42:32.149
THAN A 100% OF WHAT THEY'RE

00:42:32.216 --> 00:42:33.450
BRINGING HOME IN EVERYONE OF

00:42:33.517 --> 00:42:34.885
CALIFORNIA'S FIFTY EIGHT

00:42:34.952 --> 00:42:36.086
COUNTIES. SO WHEN YOU

00:42:36.153 --> 00:42:37.521
EXACERBATE THAT WITH THIS KIND

00:42:37.588 --> 00:42:40.424
OFGENDER BASED DISCRIMINATION

00:42:40.491 --> 00:42:41.792
IT'S REALLY COSTING OUR

00:42:41.859 --> 00:42:44.695
FAMILIES A LOT SO WHEN RECHARGE

00:42:44.762 --> 00:42:45.930
WOMEN GIRLS MORE FOR VERY SAME

00:42:45.996 --> 00:42:48.065
PRODUCTS WE'RE REALLY YOU KNOW

00:42:48.132 --> 00:42:49.833
CONTINUING THE DEEPER.

00:42:49.900 --> 00:42:51.602
INEQUALITY THAT EXIST ACROSS

00:42:51.669 --> 00:42:54.138
GENDER AND RACE LINES SO TO PUT

00:42:54.204 --> 00:42:56.740
A FINER POINT ON IT IN ORDER TO

00:42:56.807 --> 00:42:58.509
CLOSE THE ECONOMIC JASIM OPENED

00:42:58.575 --> 00:43:03.047
UP BY THE GENDER. PAY GAP OF

00:43:03.113 --> 00:43:06.116
LATINO WOMAN IN ROSEVILLE WHERE

00:43:06.183 --> 00:43:07.918
HAVE JUST. AN ADDITIONAL. FOUR

00:43:07.985 --> 00:43:09.720
ON THE UPTURN THIS AMOUNT OF

00:43:09.787 --> 00:43:12.056
MONEY HER WAY MALE. SHE'D HAVE

00:43:12.122 --> 00:43:13.157
TO WORK NEARLY AND HALF DAY.

00:43:13.223 --> 00:43:14.925
LONGER TO EARN THE SAME AMOUNT

00:43:14.992 --> 00:43:16.427
OF MONEY. SO WHEN WOMEN ARE

00:43:16.493 --> 00:43:18.262
CHARGE MORE FOR SOAP OR A

00:43:18.329 --> 00:43:20.431
TEACHER. IT ISN'T JUST AND FAIR

00:43:20.497 --> 00:43:21.799
IT FURTHER COMPOUNDS THE

00:43:21.865 --> 00:43:23.867
INJUSTICES THAT. THREATEN THEIR

00:43:23.934 --> 00:43:25.302
FINANCIAL WELL BEING AND THE

00:43:25.369 --> 00:43:26.971
ECONOMIC SECURITY OF THEIR

00:43:27.037 --> 00:43:28.739
CHILDREN AND THEIR FAMILIES AND

00:43:28.806 --> 00:43:30.140
I WOULD ARGUE THE STATE OF

00:43:30.207 --> 00:43:32.309
CALIFORNIA. WITH THE PINK TAX

00:43:32.376 --> 00:43:34.712
REPEAL ACT WE HAVE A CHANCE TO

00:43:34.778 --> 00:43:36.347
CORRECT THIS. WITH THE PASSAGE

THOUSAND DOLLARS PER FEMALE

00:58:59.035 --> 00:59:00.470
CONSUMER. NOW WE'RE FROM THE

BUSINESS PERSPECTIVE SO IT'S

00:59:02.005 --> 00:59:03.573

CONSUMER FROM CRADLE TO GRAVE

00:59:05.408 --> 00:59:07.443
BUT- OUR CONSERVATIVE ESTIMATE

00:59:07.510 --> 00:59:09.112

BUSINESSES. MULTIPLE STUDIES

00:59:23.159 --> 00:59:24.794
SHOW THAT WOMEN RECEIVE ONLY

00:59:24.861 --> 00:59:27.030
TWO POINT 2% OF THE ENSURE

00:59:27.096 --> 00:59:29.799
CAPITAL AND ANGEL FUNDING TWO

00:59:29.866 --> 00:59:33.136

WHICH HAS BEEN A CENTRAL FOCUS

01:03:01.978 --> 01:03:03.346
OF THIS DISCUSSION AND GIVEN

01:03:03.412 --> 01:03:04.247
THE GOOD WORK OF SENATOR

01:03:04.313 --> 01:03:05.615
JACKSON'S SEVERAL YEARS AGO

01:03:05.681 --> 01:03:06.649
WHERE WE ARE ABLE TO PARTNER ON

01:03:06.716 --> 01:03:08.384
THAT. I JUST ALSO READ REPORT

01:03:08.451 --> 01:03:09.719
THAT CALIFORNIA HAS THE

01:03:09.785 --> 01:03:11.721
NARROWEST WAGE GAP OUT OF THE

01:03:11.787 --> 01:03:13.156
ENTIRE CUT SO KUDOS TO SENATOR

01:03:13.222 --> 01:03:15.224
JACKSON ON THAT EVEN THOUGH

01:03:15.291 --> 01:03:16.692
THERE'S STILL A DISCREPANCY SO

01:03:16.759 --> 01:03:17.560
I WANT TO MAKE A VERY IMPORTANT

01:03:17.627 --> 01:03:19.262
PART ON THAT LEGISLATION THAT

01:03:19.328 --> 01:03:20.863
WE ARE ABLE TO PARTNER TOGETHER

01:03:20.930 --> 01:03:22.198
GENDER THOUGH GENDER

01:03:22.265 --> 01:03:23.799
LEGISLATION THAT SHE COVERED

01:03:23.866 --> 01:03:25.902
DIDN'T SAY THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY

01:03:25.968 --> 01:03:26.769
HAD TO BE EQUAL PAY WITH NO

01:03:26.836 --> 01:03:28.237
FACTORS THERE IS BONA FIDE

01:03:28.304 --> 01:03:29.338
FACTORS UPON WHICH YOU COULD

01:03:29.405 --> 01:03:34.177
HAVE A DISCREPANCY. CENTS TO

01:03:34.243 --> 01:03:35.845
THE DOLLAR AND WHETHER OR NOT

01:03:35.912 --> 01:03:36.946
THOSE THAT DISCREPANCY IS

01:03:37.013 --> 01:03:38.214
ACTUALLY BASED UPON BUT A FIGHT

01:03:38.281 --> 01:03:39.782
FACTORS SUCH AS YOUR LONGEVITY

01:03:39.849 --> 01:03:41.851
AT THE JOB SUCH AS EXPERIENCE

01:03:41.918 --> 01:03:43.452
SUCH AS EDUCATION AND THERE IS

01:03:43.519 --> 01:03:44.320
EVEN A DISCUSSION ABOUT

01:03:44.387 --> 01:03:46.055
GEOGRAPHICAL DIFFERENCES AND

01:03:46.122 --> 01:03:47.557
WHY THAT COULD JUSTIFY A WAGE

01:03:47.623 --> 01:03:49.225
DIFFERENCE AND THAT WASN'T

01:03:49.292 --> 01:03:50.593
GOING TO BE COMPLETELY EQUAL

01:03:50.660 --> 01:03:52.895
SO- THAT'S ONE ASPECT THAT I

01:03:52.962 --> 01:03:53.462
WANT TO DRESS BUT I'M ALSO

01:03:53.529 --> 01:03:55.064
GOING TO PUSH BACK ON. AND

01:03:55.131 --> 01:03:56.632
DISAGREE WITH SOME OF THE-

01:03:56.699 --> 01:03:57.466
POINTS THAT WERE MADE EARLIER

01:03:57.533 --> 01:03:59.268
THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF COMMENTS

01:03:59.335 --> 01:04:00.703
THAT THE GENDER PRICE IS

01:04:00.770 --> 01:04:02.505
DISCRIMINATION OR THAT IS A

01:04:02.572 --> 01:04:03.940
CIVIL RIGHTS VIOLATION AND I

01:04:04.006 --> 01:04:05.274
WANT TO KIND OF PUSH BACK ON

01:04:05.341 --> 01:04:07.109
THAT NOTION FOR A MOMENT WE ARE

01:04:07.176 --> 01:04:08.744
NOT TALKING ABOUT A SITUATION

01:04:08.811 --> 01:04:11.013
HERE IN WHICH I'M GOING UP TO

01:04:11.080 --> 01:04:12.782
THE REGISTER AND SENATOR HILL

01:04:12.848 --> 01:04:13.616
IS GOING UP TO THE REGISTER

01:04:13.683 --> 01:04:15.451
WITH THE PINK TEDDY BEAR. AND

01:04:15.518 --> 01:04:16.552
THEY'RE LOOKING AT ME IN THEIR

01:04:16.619 --> 01:04:17.420

AND IT COMES DOWN TO WE CHOICE

01:04:28.631 --> 01:04:29.732
THAT IS VERY DIFFERENT THAN A

01:04:29.799 --> 01:04:31.033
CIVIL RIGHTS VIOLATION WHERE

01:04:31.100 --> 01:04:32.168
YOU'RE GOING TO A PLACE OF

01:04:32.235 --> 01:04:33.936
PUBLIC ACCOMMODATION AND THE

01:04:34.003 --> 01:04:34.971
OWNER OF THE BUSINESS THE SAME.

01:04:35.037 --> 01:04:36.305
BECAUSE OF YOUR GENDER YOU

01:04:47.883 --> 01:04:49.552
HAPPENING WITH THE GOODS IF YOU

PRICE AND SO I HAVE A HARD TIME

01:04:56.726 --> 01:04:58.461
ACCEPTING THAT THIS IS

01:04:58.527 --> 01:05:00.396
DISCRIMINATION IN THE NORMAL

01:05:00.463 --> 01:05:01.530
WAY IN WHICH WE USE THAT TERM.

01:05:01.597 --> 01:05:02.698
OR THAT IT'S A CIVIL RIGHTS

01:05:02.765 --> 01:05:04.600

STUDIED WAS JUST FINISHED A-

01:08:52.495 --> 01:08:54.497
PUBLISHED IN AUG. OF TWO

01:08:54.563 --> 01:08:55.598
EIGHTEEN I BELIEVE WHERE THEY

01:08:55.664 --> 01:08:57.032
ALSO LOOK AT ABOUT TEN PERSONAL

01:08:57.099 --> 01:08:58.767

OVER TWO WEEKS SO A LITTLE BIT

01:09:00.503 --> 01:09:01.370
LONGER THAN WHAT I BELIEVE THE

01:09:01.437 --> 01:09:04.139
NEW YORK STUDY WAS AND THE TO

01:09:04.206 --> 01:09:08.277

APPLY AND HOW THE WOULD WORK I

01:09:26.061 --> 01:09:26.595
THE OTHER POINT I WON TO TALK

01:09:26.662 --> 01:09:27.763
IS THE IN MECHANISM WHICH

01:09:27.830 --> 01:09:28.397
CENTER JACK'S AND I OFF

01:09:28.464 --> 01:09:29.465
DISAGREE UPON THERE WAS A

01:09:29.532 --> 01:09:30.666

THOUSAND DOLLARS AND THERE IS A

01:09:51.921 --> 01:09:52.555
DISCUSSION OF WHETHER OR NOT

01:09:52.621 --> 01:09:54.990
THERE HAS BEEN LOCATION THERE

01:09:55.057 --> 01:09:56.392

SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR ENOUGH

01:17:24.973 --> 01:17:27.042
THAT A PINK TAX DISCOUNT IS

WARRANTED AND HAVE AN A

01:17:29.011 --> 01:17:30.545
MANUFACTURES EVER CHALLENGE

01:17:30.612 --> 01:17:32.481
THAT DETERMINATION NO WE

AT A COSTS AND THEY HAVE COME

01:17:38.353 --> 01:17:39.688
TO REALIZE THAT THEY DO HAVE

01:17:39.755 --> 01:17:41.690

ARE UNABLE TO CHANGE THE COSTS

01:17:50.399 --> 01:17:52.200
ON THEIR END BUT THEY DO WANT

01:17:52.267 --> 01:17:55.170
TO SUPPORT. OUR INITIATIVE- SO

01:17:55.237 --> 01:17:56.972
HOW DO YOU DETERMINE WHEN THOSE

01:19:13.281 --> 01:19:14.549
PRICED SEPARATELY AND THEY

01:19:14.616 --> 01:19:15.851
COULDN'T ANSWER THAT QUESTION

01:19:15.917 --> 01:19:18.053
FOR US. AND THEY ENDED UP

01:19:18.120 --> 01:19:18.787
GIVING US THE SAME COSTS FOR

01:19:18.854 --> 01:19:22.691
BOTH. INTERESTING SO- LAST

01:19:22.757 --> 01:19:25.627
QUESTION- HOW DO YOU DETERMINE

01:19:25.694 --> 01:19:27.129
WHEN A PRODUCT IS BEING

01:19:27.195 --> 01:19:28.663
MARKETED TO TWO WOMEN IN

01:19:28.730 --> 01:19:30.499
PARTICULAR ANOTHER WORKS. WHAT

01:19:30.565 --> 01:19:32.134
IF A MANUFACTURER'S CHARGING

01:19:32.200 --> 01:19:33.368
DIFFERENT PRICES FOR WHAT

01:19:33.435 --> 01:19:36.037
APPEAR TO BE THE SAME PRODUCT.

01:19:36.104 --> 01:19:36.738
BUT THERE'S NO BASIS FOR

01:19:36.805 --> 01:19:38.073
THINKING THAT THE DIFFERENCES

01:19:38.140 --> 01:19:40.509
BASED ON GENDER. THOUGH SOME

01:19:40.575 --> 01:19:43.912
MARKETING ITSELF AND GENERALLY

01:19:43.979 --> 01:19:46.114
IT'S A SOMEONE WHO IS CHAU HUNT

01:19:46.181 --> 01:19:50.519
IN THOSE IN THAT MARKETING TELL

AS WHO THERE'S TO AND SO IF

01:20:11.640 --> 01:20:12.974
THERE SHOWING A WOMAN BIRCH AND

01:20:13.041 --> 01:20:14.309
SHE HER LAN VERSUS A MALE SHE

01:20:14.376 --> 01:20:16.912
HIS THAT IS A PRETTY.

01:20:16.978 --> 01:20:17.946
SIGNIFICANT AS PRETTY TARGETED

01:20:18.013 --> 01:20:20.282

THAT HEY. THAT'S CORRECT I

01:20:21.850 --> 01:20:23.952

RAZOR WITH THE WOMAN OF NICE.

01:20:26.788 --> 01:20:28.757
OF RAZOR IN A PAIR OF LEGS

01:20:28.823 --> 01:20:31.026
SHAVING- AND THEN YOU GET THE

01:20:31.092 --> 01:20:32.661

THAT YOU'RE AWARE OF THAT ARE

01:20:50.912 --> 01:20:52.414
DOING THE SAME THING NATIONAL

01:20:52.480 --> 01:20:53.949
RETAILERS THAT. THAT ARE DOING

01:20:54.015 --> 01:20:55.584
THIS TODAY OUR GOAL IS TO GET

01:20:55.650 --> 01:20:57.652
OTHER NATIONAL RETAILERS ON

01:20:57.719 --> 01:20:58.220

IS. AS WHICH IS THE MAIN ROAD

01:21:06.194 --> 01:21:08.029
BLOCK FOR OTHER RETAILERS TO

01:21:08.096 --> 01:21:10.565
GET ON BOARD. SO SUPPORT SO IF

01:21:10.632 --> 01:21:12.834
WE WERE TO SAY TO MANUFACTURERS

01:21:12.901 --> 01:21:15.704
AT SOME LAWFUL- YOU AND TO YOU

01:21:15.770 --> 01:21:17.439
YOU KNOW THERE ARE CONSEQUENCES

01:21:17.505 --> 01:21:18.440
TO THAT YOU THINK THAT THAT

01:21:18.506 --> 01:21:20.442
WOULD. ABSOLUTELY HAVE AN

01:21:20.508 --> 01:21:22.644
IMPACT THANK. ALRIGHT WELL I

01:21:22.711 --> 01:21:25.413
WANTED TO ASK HIM IS BARRERA-

01:21:25.480 --> 01:21:27.749
ALWAYS TEMPTING TO. ENGAGE YOUR

01:21:27.816 --> 01:21:29.818
BUT VERY BRIEFLY- YOU KNOW YOU

01:21:29.884 --> 01:21:32.520
ARTICULATED A FEW REASONS THE

01:21:32.587 --> 01:21:34.055
BONA FIDE FACTORS AND WE DID

01:21:34.122 --> 01:21:35.323
THERE'S WE DO THIS AND EQUAL

01:21:35.390 --> 01:21:36.625
PAY BECAUSE IF THERE ARE

01:21:36.691 --> 01:21:38.660
JUSTIFICATIONS THAT ARE NON

01:21:38.727 --> 01:21:40.228
GENDER BASED THEIR LEGITIMATE-

01:21:40.295 --> 01:21:41.296
BUT THE GENDER BASED

01:21:41.363 --> 01:21:42.364
pDISCRIMINATION IS NOT

01:21:42.430 --> 01:21:44.866
LEGITIMATE. I HEAR IN THE

01:21:44.933 --> 01:21:47.269
SITUATION WITH THE PAIN TAX-

01:21:47.335 --> 01:21:48.470
YOU INDICATE THINGS LIKE

01:21:48.536 --> 01:21:50.105
TERRORISTS ADVANCE MARKET OF

01:21:50.171 --> 01:21:51.539
SCALE THINGS OF THAT SORT THE

01:21:51.606 --> 01:21:53.508
INGREDIENTS. I DON'T THINK

01:21:53.575 --> 01:21:55.343
WE'RE I DON'T THINK THAT WERE

01:21:55.410 --> 01:21:56.711
SAYING THAT THAT THOSE AREN'T

01:21:56.778 --> 01:21:59.014
LEGITIMATE. DIFFERENCES I THINK

01:21:59.080 --> 01:22:00.749
WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS WHEN THERE

01:22:00.815 --> 01:22:02.350
IS REALLY NO. GERMAN DIFFERENCE

01:22:02.417 --> 01:22:05.553
OR THAT YOU. MAKE THE PINK PROP

01:22:05.620 --> 01:22:07.022
THE PACKAGING THE PINK PRODUCT

01:22:07.088 --> 01:22:08.290
A LITTLE FANCIER BECAUSE YOU

01:22:08.356 --> 01:22:10.292
WANT TO ATTRACT WOMEN TO IT.

01:22:10.358 --> 01:22:12.193
THAT THAT IS A GENDER BASIS AND

01:22:12.260 --> 01:22:16.531
THAT WOULD BE UNLAWFUL SO-

01:22:16.598 --> 01:22:17.832
ASSUMING THAT WERE ON THE SAME

01:22:17.899 --> 01:22:19.200
PAGE WITH THAT THAT THAT THERE

01:22:19.267 --> 01:22:20.769
ARE BONA FIDE FACTORS AND I

01:22:20.835 --> 01:22:22.304
THINK THAT THE WEEK WE ALL

01:22:22.370 --> 01:22:24.372
AGREE WITH THAT- WHAT IS YOUR

01:22:24.439 --> 01:22:26.741
OTHER OBJECTION TO- PROHIBITING

01:22:26.808 --> 01:22:28.643
THIS KIND OF GENDER. GENDER

01:22:28.710 --> 01:22:30.412
BASED DISCRIMINATION. WELL I

01:22:30.478 --> 01:22:33.281
THINK IF WE GET I THINK. WHEN

01:22:33.348 --> 01:22:34.316
YOU LOOK AT THE BONAFIDE

01:22:34.382 --> 01:22:36.017
FACTORS IN THE WAY IF WE CAN

01:22:36.084 --> 01:22:37.185
JUST RELATE TO SB EIGHT SEVENTY

01:22:37.252 --> 01:22:39.487
THREE. YES I ALWAYS SWITCH THE

01:22:39.554 --> 01:22:40.455
NUMBERS ARE EIGHT SEVENTY

01:22:40.522 --> 01:22:42.390
THREE- WITH THE PRIVATE RIGHT

01:22:42.457 --> 01:22:43.658
OF ACTION AND IF WE CAN TALK

01:22:43.725 --> 01:22:44.626
ABOUT THAT FOR A MOMENT WITH A

01:22:44.693 --> 01:22:46.227
MINIMUM OF FOUR THOUSAND

01:22:46.294 --> 01:22:47.829
DOLLARS IN DAMAGES AND HOW THAT

01:22:47.896 --> 01:22:49.197
GOES INTO THE BONA FIDE FACTORS

01:22:49.264 --> 01:22:50.231
IF YOU'LL JUST GIVE ME A

01:22:50.298 --> 01:22:51.866
MOMENT. THE BONA FIDE FACTORS

01:22:51.933 --> 01:22:54.102
THAT'S ALL ONE. WHEN I THINK WE

01:22:54.169 --> 01:22:55.437
NEED TO LOOK AT HOW DO WE

01:22:55.503 --> 01:22:56.371
DETERMINE WHAT IS SUBSTANTIALLY

01:22:56.438 --> 01:22:57.639
SIMILAR AND I THINK THAT'S A

01:22:57.706 --> 01:22:58.907
HUGE CHALLENGE AND THE

01:22:58.973 --> 01:23:01.009
PERSPECTIVE LOOK OF A CONSUMER

01:23:01.076 --> 01:23:02.544
WHEN WE'RE SITTING HERE TALKING

01:23:02.610 --> 01:23:03.812
ABOUT. IF THE CONSUMER IS GOING

01:23:03.878 --> 01:23:04.813
TO BE LOOKING AT THE DIFFERENT

01:23:04.879 --> 01:23:06.314
INGREDIENTS AND LOOKING AT THE

01:23:06.381 --> 01:23:08.350
DIFFERENT PACKAGING AND BEING

01:23:08.416 --> 01:23:08.917
ABLE TO TELL WHETHER THEY'RE

01:23:08.983 --> 01:23:10.552
SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR AND NOT

01:23:10.618 --> 01:23:12.220
WHEN IT'S SUGGESTED THEY WON'T

01:23:12.287 --> 01:23:13.755
EVEN GO FROM MILE TO I'LL DO

01:23:13.822 --> 01:23:16.825
COMPARISON I THINK IS A HUGE

01:23:16.891 --> 01:23:18.159
PROBLEM. WHEN CAN BE THE

01:23:18.226 --> 01:23:19.994
ENFORCERS. BUT WE SAY OKAY.

01:23:20.061 --> 01:23:21.129
THERE'S ACTUALLY SENT WHERE YOU

01:23:21.196 --> 01:23:23.298
CAN HAVE A PER DIFFERENCE BASED

01:23:23.365 --> 01:23:24.599
ON BOTH BUT FACT RATED AS YOU

01:23:24.666 --> 01:23:27.302
MAY YOU LISTED THOSE OUT HERE'S

01:23:27.369 --> 01:23:28.803
THE CHALLENGE. PRIVATE RIGHT OF

01:23:28.870 --> 01:23:30.805
ACTION THE MINIMUM FOR THAT

01:23:30.872 --> 01:23:32.707
DOLLARS IF THE ELDER PLANE. AND

01:23:32.774 --> 01:23:37.112
THEY SAY. IS THE SAME AS THE

01:23:37.178 --> 01:23:37.779
BLU RAY. AND I PAID FOR CENTS.

01:23:37.846 --> 01:23:38.947
AN THEY FOUND THAT LOS. AGAIN

01:23:39.013 --> 01:23:39.647
THE RETAILER LEGISLATOR

01:23:39.714 --> 01:23:40.281
RETAILER BECAUSE THAT'S THE PER

01:23:40.348 --> 01:23:41.549
WHO THE- MOST LIKELY INTERACTS

01:23:41.616 --> 01:23:43.685
WITH RATE- THE RETAILERS GOING

01:23:43.752 --> 01:23:45.720
TO LOOK AT THAT. AND SAY I CAN

01:23:45.787 --> 01:23:47.255
GO OUT AND HIRE AN ATTORNEY TO

DEFENSE FOR ALL THE WAY THROUGH

TROUT WOULD BE A HUNDRED AND

01:23:53.061 --> 01:23:53.628
FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS I CAN GO

DECISION. YOU'RE GONNA MAKE A

01:24:11.045 --> 01:24:13.248

MAKING. IS DONE AT THE

THINK THAT THAT OPENS THE

01:25:18.780 --> 01:25:21.583
FLOODGATES. BUT I DON'T THINK

01:25:21.649 --> 01:25:24.052
THAT THE- THE HISTORY. OF ANY

01:25:42.804 --> 01:25:44.005
DOLLARS MAY BE VIEWED BY SOME

01:25:44.072 --> 01:25:45.340
OF THESE COMPANIES AS A COSTS

01:25:45.406 --> 01:25:48.743
DOING BUSINESS- AND WHEN WE

DID THIS THE COPAY YOU YOU

01:25:55.917 --> 01:25:56.918
WEIGH THEM LET'S SAY HAVE A OF

01:25:56.985 --> 01:25:59.420
PERFUME VERSUS AMEND COLOGNE.

01:25:59.487 --> 01:26:00.822
AND YOU USE. DIFFERENT PRODUCTS

01:26:00.889 --> 01:26:02.257
IN THEM. BUT THEY'RE ACTUALLY

01:26:02.323 --> 01:26:03.625
PRODUCTS THE COST THE SAME

01:26:03.691 --> 01:26:06.327
AMOUNT OF MONEY. SHOULD YOU BE

01:26:06.394 --> 01:26:07.962
ABLE TO CHARGE MORE FOR THE

01:26:08.029 --> 01:26:09.797
WOMAN'S PRODUCT VERSUS THE MANS

01:26:09.864 --> 01:26:12.233
I WOULD POSIT NOW. IF ONE OF

01:26:12.300 --> 01:26:15.003
THE IF THE COST OF THE ITEM IS

01:26:15.069 --> 01:26:16.538
MORE EXPENSIVE THAT'S A

01:26:16.604 --> 01:26:19.040
JUSTIFICATION BUT WHAT WE SEE

01:26:19.107 --> 01:26:20.441
AND I KNOW THIS IS TRUE IN SOME

01:26:20.508 --> 01:26:21.776
INSTANCES THE DIFFERENCE

01:26:21.843 --> 01:26:23.211
BETWEEN MEN'S COLOGNE AND

01:26:23.278 --> 01:26:24.012
WOMEN'S PERFUME. IS THE

01:26:24.078 --> 01:26:27.582
PACKAGING. BUT THE COST IS

01:26:27.649 --> 01:26:30.151
SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT. IN IN

01:26:30.218 --> 01:26:34.155
MANY INSTANCES- SO AGAIN THIS

01:26:34.222 --> 01:26:36.758
WILL REQUIRE. A COMPANIES TO GO

01:26:36.824 --> 01:26:39.427
BACK AND REVIEW THE DECISION

01:26:39.494 --> 01:26:41.729
MAKING PRACTICES THEY HAVE. ARE

01:26:41.796 --> 01:26:43.798
ARE YOU SUGGESTING THE COMPANY

01:26:43.865 --> 01:26:44.666
SHOULDN'T HAVE TO DO THIS OR

01:26:44.732 --> 01:26:46.801
SHOULDN'T BE. THAT IT WOULD BE

01:26:46.868 --> 01:26:48.002
TOO BURDENSOME ON COMPANIES TO

01:26:48.069 --> 01:26:49.737
DO THIS NOW I LOOK WHAT I'LL

01:26:49.804 --> 01:26:51.239
SUGGEST IN JUST SICK KIND OF

01:26:51.306 --> 01:26:51.940
ADDRESS SOME OF THE COMMENTS

01:26:52.006 --> 01:26:54.175
THAT YOU- JUST PRESENTED BACK

01:26:54.242 --> 01:26:55.643
ON THE LITIGATION FOR A MOMENT.

01:26:55.710 --> 01:26:57.078
WE HAVE SEEN THE LITIGATION

01:26:57.145 --> 01:26:59.113
BECAUSE THE OTHER CODE SECTION

01:26:59.180 --> 01:27:00.448
THAT FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS

01:27:00.515 --> 01:27:02.550
STATUE OR STATUTORY DAMAGES

01:27:02.617 --> 01:27:03.885
THAT'S ALSO THE CODE SECTION

01:27:03.952 --> 01:27:04.619
THAT ENFORCES THE

01:27:04.686 --> 01:27:06.888
ACCESSIBILITY- CASES THAT WE

01:27:06.955 --> 01:27:08.590
HAVE SEEN THROUGHOUT THE STATE

01:27:08.656 --> 01:27:09.724
HIT SMALL BUSINESS IN

01:27:09.791 --> 01:27:11.626
PARTICULAR. AND THERE'S A MINOR

01:27:11.693 --> 01:27:13.895
MINOR VIOLATIONS WITH REGARDS

01:27:13.962 --> 01:27:15.630
TO A DOOR HANDLE WHICH I

01:27:15.697 --> 01:27:17.765
APPRECIATE THE INTENT AND THE

01:27:17.832 --> 01:27:19.300
AND THE NEED FOR DISABILITY

01:27:19.367 --> 01:27:20.468
ACCESS I'M NOT SUGGESTING IN

01:27:20.535 --> 01:27:22.070
ANY WAY THAT THAT'S NOT. A

01:27:22.136 --> 01:27:23.705
SIGNIFICANT RIGHT BUT WHAT WE

01:27:23.771 --> 01:27:25.773
SEE IS AGAIN THIS PRIVATE RIGHT

01:27:25.840 --> 01:27:27.375
OF ACTION WITH A MINIMUM OF

01:27:27.442 --> 01:27:27.909
FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS IN

01:27:27.976 --> 01:27:29.544
DAMAGES BEING UTILIZED TO

01:27:29.611 --> 01:27:31.179
LEVERAGE QUICK SETTLEMENTS FROM

01:27:31.245 --> 01:27:32.814
THE SMALL BUSINESSES WHY

01:27:32.880 --> 01:27:34.716
DISAGREED THERE HAS BEEN A

01:27:34.782 --> 01:27:37.118
SIGNIFICANT HISTORY. AND

01:27:37.185 --> 01:27:42.290
EXAMPLES OF THE LAW TO BE. WITH

01:27:42.357 --> 01:27:43.992
REPORTS TO CODES AND THAT EIGHT

01:27:44.058 --> 01:27:48.896
SEP THREES. TO SURE SHOULD TO

01:27:48.963 --> 01:27:49.430
MAKE THESE DETERMINE WITH

01:27:49.497 --> 01:27:50.231
REGARDS TO PRICING BASED UPON

01:27:50.298 --> 01:27:51.265
GEN. I DON'T THINK THAT AN

01:27:51.332 --> 01:27:52.667
ALICE THAT GOES THE MANY. TODAY

01:27:52.734 --> 01:27:54.168
AND I THINK THAT IF YOU WERE TO

01:27:54.235 --> 01:27:56.070
HAVE A MANUFACTURER SITTING UP

01:27:56.137 --> 01:27:57.572
HERE IN TESTIFYING INSANE WHAT

01:27:57.639 --> 01:27:58.740
IS THE REASON WHY YOU'RE

01:27:58.806 --> 01:28:00.875
CHARGING AN X. AMOUNT AMOUNT.

01:28:00.942 --> 01:28:02.043
FOR THIS PROJECT IN A DIFFERENT

01:28:02.110 --> 01:28:02.877
AMOUNT FOR THIS PROJECT THERE

01:28:02.944 --> 01:28:04.512
WOULD BE A LIST OF COST

01:28:04.579 --> 01:28:05.279
ASSOCIATED WITH THAT AS I

01:28:05.346 --> 01:28:06.648
MENTIONED BEFORE INGREDIENTS

01:28:06.714 --> 01:28:08.216
CAN BE DIFFERENT I DON'T KNOW

01:28:08.282 --> 01:28:09.117
THAT MEN'S COLOGNE IS THE SAME

01:28:09.183 --> 01:28:10.218
AS WOMEN'S COLOGNE I WOULD

01:28:10.284 --> 01:28:11.519
SUGGEST THAT THEY ARE DIFFERENT

01:28:11.586 --> 01:28:12.787
AND FRAGRANCES AND SO I'M NOT

01:28:12.854 --> 01:28:14.789
AN EXPERT ON. HOW IT'S MADE BUT

01:28:14.856 --> 01:28:15.890
THE INGREDIENTS AND GOT TO BE

01:28:15.957 --> 01:28:18.159
DIFFERENT BUT SECONDLY- THE

01:28:18.226 --> 01:28:19.594
MARKETING THAT GOES INTO IT

01:28:19.661 --> 01:28:21.429
ADVERTISING THAT GOES INTO IT

01:28:21.496 --> 01:28:22.363
THAT'S ALL OF COSTS AS A PART

01:28:22.430 --> 01:28:25.133
OF IT AND- MAYBE. MY SECOND I

01:28:25.199 --> 01:28:27.435
PUT A HIGHER. PRICE OR A HIGH

01:28:27.502 --> 01:28:29.337
VALUE ON PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS

01:28:29.404 --> 01:28:31.639
THAN MEN DO I'M SURE THAT MAY

01:28:31.706 --> 01:28:33.207
BE A TENDER STEREO TYPE THAT I

01:28:33.274 --> 01:28:35.176
JUST ASSERTED BUT I HAVE TO

01:28:35.243 --> 01:28:35.977
BELIEVE TO SOME EXTENT THAT'S

01:28:36.044 --> 01:28:37.278
TRUE MAYBE I'M WILLING AT THE

01:28:37.345 --> 01:28:39.280
CONSUMER. TO PAY A HIGHER

01:28:39.347 --> 01:28:40.848
AMOUNT FOR A CERTAIN PRODUCT A

01:28:40.915 --> 01:28:42.884
CERTAIN BRAND A CERTAIN SMELL A

01:28:42.950 --> 01:28:44.152
CERTAIN FRAGRANCE BECAUSE AS A

01:28:44.218 --> 01:28:45.653
CONSUMER I VALUE THAT BUT THEN

01:28:45.720 --> 01:28:48.222
PERHAPS AMANDA SO. THAT'S OF

01:28:48.289 --> 01:28:51.325
ANSWER YOUR QUESTION IF I AM

01:28:51.392 --> 01:28:53.928
PLEASED. THREE I IT AND I'LL

01:28:53.995 --> 01:28:54.529
TRY AND BE MORE. I THINK WE

01:28:54.595 --> 01:28:55.163
WILL OTHER OF MANY OTHER UP. TO

01:28:55.229 --> 01:28:56.297
CAN. THIS CALL. ALWAYS

01:28:56.364 --> 01:28:58.166
APPRECIATE YOUR PERSPECTIVE

01:28:58.232 --> 01:29:00.968
AGAIN. PART OF THIS LEGISLATION

01:29:01.035 --> 01:29:03.204
IS TO MAKE- COMPANIES

01:29:03.271 --> 01:29:05.239
MANUFACTURERS MORE AWARE OF

01:29:05.306 --> 01:29:07.275
THESE DIFFERENTIALS AND TO TAKE

01:29:07.341 --> 01:29:08.409
TO MAKE A STATEMENT AS THE

01:29:08.476 --> 01:29:09.577
STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT THIS

01:29:09.644 --> 01:29:11.679
KIND OF. A DISCRIMINATION AND

01:29:11.746 --> 01:29:14.649
PRICING IS NOT ACCEPTABLE SO WE

01:29:14.716 --> 01:29:16.117
WILL CONTINUE THAT CONVERSATION

01:29:16.184 --> 01:29:18.186
ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS

01:29:18.252 --> 01:29:20.988

01:29:34.836 --> 01:29:37.171
CONNECTING WITH. THIS ISSUE

01:29:37.238 --> 01:29:39.173
ABOUT THE PRODUCTS TO THE

01:29:39.240 --> 01:29:41.943
BROADER ISSUE. WOMEN IN

01:29:47.648 --> 01:29:49.584
SOMETIMES WE CAN GET TO IN THE

01:29:49.650 --> 01:29:52.120
WEEDS TOO MUCH IN THE DETAIL OF

01:29:52.186 --> 01:29:54.589
WHAT PRODUCT OR ONE. VERY SMALL

01:29:54.655 --> 01:29:57.592
PROBLEM AND THEN WE IGNORE

01:29:57.658 --> 01:30:00.394
WHAT'S GOING ON MORE BROADLY.

01:30:00.461 --> 01:30:02.630
AND THAT'S WHAT I'VE KIND OF

01:30:02.697 --> 01:30:04.532
LEARNED TODAY IS THAT THERE IS

01:30:04.599 --> 01:30:05.767
A CONNECTION WITHOUT THIS PANEL

01:30:05.833 --> 01:30:07.034

01:30:07.101 --> 01:30:09.370
CONNECTIO BACK TO. YOU KNOW

01:30:09.437 --> 01:30:12.140

ACCESS TO CAPITAL AS YOU ALL

01:30:14.709 --> 01:30:15.743

01:30:15.810 --> 01:30:18.012
DIFFICULTY OF WOMEN- TO GET

01:30:18.079 --> 01:30:20.248

THOUGH THAT. WITH THIS ONE

01:30:53.147 --> 01:30:56.851
SMALL STUDY IT HAS IDENTIFIED

01:30:56.918 --> 01:30:59.253
SO MANY DIFFERENT PRODUCTS AND

01:30:59.320 --> 01:31:02.056
JUST OUR OWN SORT OF DAY TO DAY

01:31:02.123 --> 01:31:03.391
I REALLY WASN'T PAYING

01:31:03.457 --> 01:31:05.359
ATTENTION TO THIS LIKE I DO I

01:31:05.426 --> 01:31:07.395
STILL CAN'T BELIEVE THAT THEY

01:31:07.461 --> 01:31:09.297
WOULD BE SUCH DIFFERENCES IN

01:31:09.363 --> 01:31:12.400
PRICES- AND YOU KNOW I CONSIDER

01:31:12.466 --> 01:31:14.702

FEMINIST AT. NIGHT OF IT'S

01:31:18.773 --> 01:31:20.441

THIS IS GOING ON RIGHT UNDER

01:31:22.643 --> 01:31:26.113
OUR NOSES SO. I GUESS HOW. HOW

01:31:26.180 --> 01:31:29.016

01:31:29.083 --> 01:31:30.751
LANGUAGE OF THIS BILL FOR

01:31:30.818 --> 01:31:33.588
EXAMPLE MS BUT IT IS- THERE'S A

01:31:33.654 --> 01:31:35.256
PROBLEM WITH ENCOURAGING

01:31:35.323 --> 01:31:37.158
LITIGATION THAT YOU MIGHT BE

01:31:37.225 --> 01:31:39.293

01:31:39.360 --> 01:31:43.331
PROBLEM HERE AND- AS WOMEN AS

01:31:43.397 --> 01:31:45.600
MEN AND WOMEN. WERE CONSCIOUS

01:31:45.666 --> 01:31:48.569
OF TRYING TO EQUALIZE OURSELVES

01:31:48.636 --> 01:31:51.439

01:32:00.982 --> 01:32:04.385
DAY. HE'S GOT TWO GIRLS BUT-

01:32:04.452 --> 01:32:06.387
AND I'M JUST KIND OF RAMBLING

01:32:06.454 --> 01:32:09.023
BUT IT'S HOW DO WE ADDRESS

01:32:09.090 --> 01:32:12.159
THIS. BECAUSE IT IS RIGHT THERE

01:32:12.226 --> 01:32:14.061
IT'S RIGHT THERE SO THERE'S

01:32:14.128 --> 01:32:15.863
GOTTA BE A WAY OF ADDRESSING.

01:32:15.930 --> 01:32:19.467
THE SYSTEMIC ISSUES. AND COME

01:32:19.533 --> 01:32:24.505

01:32:24.572 --> 01:32:26.073
OUR EXAMPLE OF. IN I DON'T KNOW

01:32:26.140 --> 01:32:28.509

BEHAVIOR OF COMPANIES WHO WHO

01:32:31.112 --> 01:32:34.081

01:32:57.038 --> 01:32:58.406
ABUSES THAT WE'VE SEEN

SPECIALLY WITH ADA COMPLIANCE

01:33:00.141 --> 01:33:04.946

01:33:17.992 --> 01:33:19.327
SEE MORE OF THAT ENFORCEMENT.

01:33:19.393 --> 01:33:21.095
BUT BUT THAT IS A CHALLENGE FOR

01:33:21.162 --> 01:33:22.163
ME AND PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION

01:33:22.229 --> 01:33:23.864
BUT I DO YOU DON'T WIN IN THE

01:33:23.931 --> 01:33:26.834
STUDIES ON THIS THE- LITTLE.

01:33:26.901 --> 01:33:28.769
SHOWER SHOES THAT WE SAW THE-

01:33:28.836 --> 01:33:30.404
THEIR THIRD IT DOES SEEM TO BE

01:33:30.471 --> 01:33:32.974
A PERVASIVE PROBLEM. AND IN

01:33:33.040 --> 01:33:34.408
THAT FROM GOING WITH SENATOR

01:33:34.475 --> 01:33:35.943
ROGERS IF THERE DOES SEEM TO BE

01:33:36.010 --> 01:33:38.846
AN ISSUE HERE RELATEDTO. TO

01:33:38.913 --> 01:33:40.381
THE COST DIFFERENTIAL THAT

01:33:40.448 --> 01:33:42.383
COMES FROM WHAT TO EAT BUT- I

01:33:42.450 --> 01:33:45.019
GUESS WHAT I'M NOT SEEN AND WE

01:33:45.086 --> 01:33:46.887
HAVE THIS CERTAINLY AND I DID

01:33:46.954 --> 01:33:48.556
LOOK THROUGH THIS A LITTLE MORE

01:33:48.622 --> 01:33:50.791
DETAIL. LEFT THE COMPANY FROM.

01:33:50.858 --> 01:33:54.228
BUT THE SOME OF OUR- PRODUCTS

01:33:54.295 --> 01:33:54.929
THEY'RE NOT THE SAME MORE

01:33:54.996 --> 01:33:56.797
SHIRTS SOME ARE ON SALE SUMMER

01:33:56.864 --> 01:33:59.233
NOT. BUT IT WOULD BE

01:33:59.300 --> 01:34:01.736
INTERESTING TO THERE HAVE BEEN

01:34:01.802 --> 01:34:06.340
A- KIND OF A- IN THE- NOW. OF

01:34:06.407 --> 01:34:13.481
LOOK AT THE. THIS IF THERE.

01:34:13.547 --> 01:34:16.751
BEEN THIS DISC. PRETTY IT. I

01:34:16.817 --> 01:34:17.385
MEAN THE I DON'T KNOW. HOW YOU

01:34:17.451 --> 01:34:18.119
CAN CALL IT ANYTHING. THAT

01:34:18.185 --> 01:34:19.253
INTER OF THE PRODUCTS THAT WE

01:34:19.320 --> 01:34:20.054
SEEN IN AT THAT WERE BE EITHER

01:34:20.121 --> 01:34:22.456
AND- TO BE ABLE TO. TO IDENTIFY

01:34:22.523 --> 01:34:24.492
THE PROBLEMS AND- THEN LOOK AT

01:34:24.558 --> 01:34:26.127
WHAT THAT MOTIVATION HAS BEEN

01:34:26.193 --> 01:34:27.728
AND HOW IT WORKS AND THEN WE

01:34:27.795 --> 01:34:28.863
CAN I THINK CORRECTED BECAUSE

01:34:28.929 --> 01:34:30.998
THERE HAS TO BE A WAY. AROUND

01:34:31.065 --> 01:34:32.266
THIS TO MEAN THE COST THE

01:34:32.333 --> 01:34:34.468
DOLLAR THE- HELP CONSUMERS

01:34:34.535 --> 01:34:38.672
PAIN- IS- IS OUTRAGEOUS FOR IF

01:34:38.739 --> 01:34:39.306
YOU LOOK AT THAT FROM THE

01:34:39.373 --> 01:34:40.574
DIFFERENCES SO HOPEFULLY WE CAN

01:34:40.641 --> 01:34:42.910
SEE THAT THE- THE DATA. AND

01:34:42.977 --> 01:34:44.178
THEN DETERMINE IF IT IS A

01:34:44.245 --> 01:34:45.946
PROBLEM THAT ACTUALLY NEEDS TO

01:34:46.013 --> 01:34:47.481
BE CORRECTED I MEAN FROM WHAT

01:34:47.548 --> 01:34:48.983
I'VE SEEN IT IS A PROBLEM BUT

01:34:49.050 --> 01:34:50.985
I'D BE NICE. TO HAVE SOME TO GO

01:34:51.052 --> 01:34:53.687

01:35:30.724 --> 01:35:32.526
EXPENSIVE. THAT THEY DON'T

01:35:32.593 --> 01:35:33.861
UNDERSTAND THAT LANGUAGE

01:35:33.928 --> 01:35:35.229
THEY'RE GOING TO SIT THERE AND

01:35:35.296 --> 01:35:35.963

OF THING THAT. THAT YOU ARE

HAVE TO ASK IS A WHY IS SEN

01:35:48.142 --> 01:35:50.177
HAPPENING. IN IN MAYBE IF I

01:35:50.244 --> 01:35:51.479
COULD JUST IN THINKING ABOUT

01:35:51.545 --> 01:35:52.213
THAT BECAUSE I'M GOING BACK IN

01:35:52.279 --> 01:35:54.281
MY MEMORY OF THE BICYCLE THAT I

01:35:54.348 --> 01:35:55.116
BOUGHT FOR MY GRANDDAUGHTER THE

01:35:55.182 --> 01:35:56.317
PINK ONE THAT I HAD TO GET

01:35:56.383 --> 01:35:58.018
BECAUSE IT WAS PAYING. FOR HER.

01:35:58.085 --> 01:35:59.854
AND NOW I'M WONDERING HOW MUCH

01:35:59.920 --> 01:36:01.088
I PAY MORE FOR THAT PROBABLY

01:36:01.155 --> 01:36:03.824
ABOUT 13% OF IT FOR ME 13% BUT

01:36:03.891 --> 01:36:05.659
I GUESS WHAT I'M LOOKING AT IS.

01:36:05.726 --> 01:36:07.061
WORKING THIS IS FOR HILL. TALK

01:36:07.128 --> 01:36:09.130
ABOUT SEXIST IN THAT COMMENT

01:36:09.196 --> 01:36:10.764
AIDS. YOU KNOW WHAT I'M WITH MY

01:36:10.831 --> 01:36:12.166
GRANDDAUGHTERS AND THEY WANT

01:36:12.233 --> 01:36:14.735

MOST OF US ARE THE SAME WAY IN

01:36:21.842 --> 01:36:23.377
THE THEN THE QUESTION BECOMES

01:36:23.444 --> 01:36:25.045
WHY WHY DO THEY WANT PINK AND

01:36:25.112 --> 01:36:26.247
THEN WHY IS STEPPING MORE

01:36:26.313 --> 01:36:28.549
EXPENSIVE. THAN THINKING IF IT

01:36:28.616 --> 01:36:29.150
WERE MY GROUP F. I HAVE

01:36:29.216 --> 01:36:33.020

01:36:49.036 --> 01:36:50.171
THEY ME THEY KNOW THAT THE

01:36:50.237 --> 01:36:50.905
WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN BECAUSE

01:36:50.971 --> 01:36:52.306
WE'RE GOING TO DO BUT BUILT FOR

01:36:52.373 --> 01:36:54.808
THOUGHT IN THAT'S PART OF WHY

01:36:54.875 --> 01:36:56.477
WE HAVE THIS DISCUSSION AND I

01:36:56.544 --> 01:36:58.512

DISAGREE WITH THIS AND THIS THE

01:37:07.488 --> 01:37:09.190
COURTS ARE SET UP SO THAT WE

01:37:09.256 --> 01:37:13.060

01:37:24.905 --> 01:37:25.639
HAD A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION

01:37:25.706 --> 01:37:28.142
IN IT. SINCE NINETEEN FIFTY

01:37:28.209 --> 01:37:29.276
NINE AND E HAVEN'T SEEN THE

01:37:29.343 --> 01:37:33.247

I'VE HAD A PROBLEM WITH A DA- I

01:37:34.882 --> 01:37:36.650
DON'T EQUATE THE TWO BUT IF

01:37:36.717 --> 01:37:38.352
THERE'S SOME WAY WE CAN. SURE

01:37:38.419 --> 01:37:39.386
EVERYONE WE'RE NOT TALKING

01:37:39.453 --> 01:37:40.921
ABOUT THIS THIS IS APPLES AND

01:37:40.988 --> 01:37:42.556
ORANGES A WE'RE NOT. THAT WE'RE

01:37:42.623 --> 01:37:44.925
NOT LOOKING A TAD ALTHOUGH-

01:37:44.992 --> 01:37:46.460
HOPEFULLY WE'RE SEEING LESS AND

01:37:46.527 --> 01:37:49.396
LESS ADA VIOLATIONS- OF BECAUSE

01:37:49.463 --> 01:37:50.931
OF THAT OU KNOW YOU CAN EVEN

01:37:50.998 --> 01:37:52.366

INTIMIDATION SO THE PEOPLE ARE

01:37:54.368 --> 01:37:56.070
COMPLYING WITH THE LAW. WHAT'S

01:37:56.136 --> 01:37:57.471
INTERESTING THERE BY THE WAY.

01:37:57.538 --> 01:37:58.639
IS A LOT OF THE QUESTIONS WELL

01:37:58.706 --> 01:37:59.873
WHO'S RESPONSIBLE SAID THE

01:37:59.940 --> 01:38:01.575
LANDLORD WHO RENTS OUT THE

01:38:01.642 --> 01:38:03.344
UNITS TO PEOPLE THE- THE

01:38:03.410 --> 01:38:05.946
BUSINESSES THEMSELVES THAT HAVE

01:38:06.013 --> 01:38:07.681
TO DO THE BUILD OUT- IT IS

01:38:07.748 --> 01:38:09.049
SIMPLE PROBLEM HERE WHO IS

01:38:09.116 --> 01:38:10.017
RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS PRIVATE

01:38:10.084 --> 01:38:11.619
PRICING. FRAGILE AND IS THE

01:38:11.685 --> 01:38:13.454
BILL PROCEEDS HOPEFULLY WE'LL

01:38:13.520 --> 01:38:15.589
WE'LL HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS

01:38:15.656 --> 01:38:16.857
AND TRY TO PINPOINT. IS WHERE

01:38:16.924 --> 01:38:19.026
THE PROBLEM LIES IN HOW THE HOW

01:38:19.093 --> 01:38:20.594
WE CAN BEST ADDRESS IT BECAUSE

01:38:20.661 --> 01:38:22.630
I THINK WE ALL. RECOGNIZE THAT

01:38:22.696 --> 01:38:25.599
THERE. THERE CLEARLY HAS BEEN A

01:38:25.666 --> 01:38:28.035
DISCRIMINATION IN PRICING AND

01:38:28.102 --> 01:38:29.236
WHAT'S PARTICULARLY DISTRESSING

01:38:29.303 --> 01:38:31.305
IS HOW WE'RE- BASED UPON THIS

01:38:31.372 --> 01:38:34.241
TESTIMONY REALIZE THAT MOST OF

01:38:34.308 --> 01:38:36.644
THE PROBLEM IS RELATIVELY NEW.

01:38:36.710 --> 01:38:37.244
FIND OTHER WAYS YOU KNOW USED

01:38:37.311 --> 01:38:40.014

DEPARTMENT AND THE GIRLS TOYS

01:38:42.316 --> 01:38:44.118
DEPARTMENT AND THEN THERE WERE

01:38:44.184 --> 01:38:46.854
LAWSUIT ABOUT THAT THAT THEY

01:38:46.920 --> 01:38:48.055
COULD NO LONGER DO THAT. SO

01:38:48.122 --> 01:38:48.956
THAT IN EVERY KIND OF GOT.

01:38:49.023 --> 01:38:51.659
AGAIN TILL. COMPANY FIGURE OUT

01:38:51.725 --> 01:38:52.192
A WAY THAT THEY COULD YET

01:38:52.259 --> 01:38:54.028
AGAINST MORE MONEY OUT OF

01:38:54.094 --> 01:38:58.766
PRODUCT FOR GIRLS AND- WOMEN.

THE TO THE MEN OF OUR WOMEN

01:39:02.803 --> 01:39:06.173
BUSINESS. A COMMUNITY OF THE

01:39:06.240 --> 01:39:07.207
COMPANIES THAT ARE REALLY

01:39:07.274 --> 01:39:08.976
TRYING TO DO THE RIGHT THING

01:39:09.043 --> 01:39:13.914
WILL GET THE CHECK THE. TWENTY

01:39:13.981 --> 01:39:16.884
CENTER WORKING AT AND- OF THE

01:39:16.950 --> 01:39:18.252
CERTAINLY. I LOOKED TO THE CAN.

01:39:18.319 --> 01:39:20.587
THAT A DISK. A AS WE GO FORWARD.

01:39:20.654 --> 01:39:24.091
WE DO WANT ONE FIGHT. THEY JUST

01:39:24.158 --> 01:39:24.725
MAKE ONE COMMENT SO SENATOR AND

01:39:24.792 --> 01:39:26.527
REFUGES INDULGE ME FOR ONE

01:39:26.593 --> 01:39:27.795
SECOND AND IT'S NOT ABOUT THE

01:39:27.861 --> 01:39:29.763
PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION BUT- I

01:39:29.830 --> 01:39:31.265
THINK IT'S AN INTERESTING LIKE

01:39:31.332 --> 01:39:32.633
PERSONAL CHOICE AND I'VE BEEN

01:39:32.700 --> 01:39:33.934
AND NOW SINCE THIS ISSUE HAS

01:39:34.001 --> 01:39:35.569
BEEN WHEN YOU'RE IN A RETAIL

01:39:35.636 --> 01:39:36.937
LOCATION TO KIND OF DO YOUR OWN

01:39:37.004 --> 01:39:38.739
ANALYSIS EVEN GOOGLE ON OUR

01:39:38.806 --> 01:39:40.240
ONLINE RETAILERS AND KIND OF

01:39:40.307 --> 01:39:41.842
COMPARE PRODUCTS BECAUSE- I

01:39:41.909 --> 01:39:43.844
THINK THAT IS- A- IN A WAY TO

01:39:43.911 --> 01:39:45.479
KIND OF INVESTIGATE THIS EVEN

01:39:45.546 --> 01:39:46.547
FURTHER AND TO FIND CERTAIN

01:39:46.613 --> 01:39:48.115
PRODUCTS AND LOOK TO SEE WHAT

01:39:48.182 --> 01:39:48.849
THE PINK ONE IS VERSUS HE

01:39:48.916 --> 01:39:50.017
OTHER COLORS. TO DO YOUR OWN

01:39:50.084 --> 01:39:52.119
SELF ANALYSIS OF THIS ISSUES-

01:39:52.186 --> 01:39:53.654
WHEN YOU'RE STUDYING IT I THINK

01:39:53.721 --> 01:39:55.856
IT'S HELPFUL I AGREE

01:39:55.923 --> 01:39:59.093
UNFORTUNATELY THE PROBLEM I'LL
