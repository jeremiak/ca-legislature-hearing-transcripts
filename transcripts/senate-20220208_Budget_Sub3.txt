I AM READY GOOD AFTERNOON SENATOR A MAN I'M SUSAN THE MORRIS AND I'M HONORED TO PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF THE DEPARTMENT OF AGING'S BUDGET. FOR MY FIRST TIME AS CDA DIRECTOR. MY PREDECESSOR CHEMICALLY WADE NOW SERVES AS THE SENIOR ADVISER TO GOVERNOR NEWSOM ON AGING DISABILITY AND ALZHEIMER'S. THE SENIOR ADVISER ROLE FULFILLS A KEY LEADERSHIP RECOMMENDATION IN BOTH THE MASTER PLAN FOR AGING AND THE GOVERNOR'S ALZHEIMER'S PREVENTION AND PREPAREDNESS TASK FORCE REPORT. I WANT TO START BY EXTENDING MY DEEPAPPRECIATION TO YOU AND THE MEMBERS OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE AND TO YOUR STAFF FOR YOUR WORK ON CTA'S CURRENT YEAR BUDGET.

OUR DEPARTMENTS PROGRESS TO DATE. TOGETHER WE'RE BUILDING A MORE EQUITABLE ST FOR ALL AGES AND ABILITIES. LAST MONTH WE CELEBRATED THE ONE YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF THE LAUNCH OF THE CALIFORNIA MASTER PLANNED FOR AGING. THIS TEN YEAR BLUEPRINT FOR OUR STATE SET FIVE BOLD GOALS FOR TWENTY THIRTY. THIS IS THE YEAR WHEN ONE IN EVERY FOR CALIFORNIANS WILL BE AGE SIXTY OR OLDER. WITH ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY TWO MASTER PLAN INITIATIVES IN JUST THE FIRST TWO YEARS ALONE. WERE EAGER TO REPORT TO YOU ON THE WORK UNDERWAY AND THE IMPORTANT WORK STILL TO COME. GOING FORWARD WERE GUIDED BY SEVERAL ROBUST STAKEHOLDER GROUPS AND A PUBLIC FACING DATA DASHBOARD TO ENSURE ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY THIS DAY THE CUPBOARD PANDEMIC HAS DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED OLDER ADULTS. ESPECIALLY OLDER ADULTS OF COLOR AND THOSE LIVING IN LONG TERM CARE. CDA IS EXTREMELY PROUD OF OUR ROLE IN THE STATE'S COLLECTIVE EFFORTS TO ACHIEVE EQUITY AND INCLUSION NOT ISOLATION. TO PROMOTE VACCINATIONS AND BOOSTERS. AND TO SUPPORT INDIVIDUALS LIVING AT HOME AS WELL AS THE MOST VULNERABLE AND NURSING HOMES. THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED BUDGET ENABLES US TO CONTINUE THIS CRITICAL WORK WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY BUILDING OUT OUR WORK FORCE. AND NETWORK CAPACITY TO EXTEND THE REACH OF OUR PROGRAMS AND SERVICES TO FAR MORE OLDER ADULTS. PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES AND FAMILY CARE GIVERS. WE VERY MUCH LOOK FORWARD TO PARTNERING WITH YOU AND THE LEGISLATURE ON ALL OF THE PROPOSALS AND THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. BEING A NEW DIRECTOR I AM SO GRATEFUL TO OUR INCREDIBLE CDA STAFF TEAM AND I AM PLEASED TODAY TO BE JOINED BY OUR DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR ADMINISTRATION THOMAS CAMERON WHO YOU JUST HEARD FROM.

THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY AND I TURN IT OVER TO THOMAS NOW THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND WELCOME DIRECTOR. THANK YOU. YOU BACK WITH US THOMAS. YES MA'AM HELLO AGAIN CHAIR. THOMAS CAMERON W. DIRECTOR FOR ADMINISTRATION WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF AGING. ARE BRIEFLY I'M JUST GOING TO WALK THROUGH OUR PROPOSED BUDGET FOR TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE AND THEN- RUN THROUGH OUR BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSALS INCLUDED AS PART OF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET- ARTICLES FUNDING LEVEL FOR TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE IS TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY EIGHT MILLION. DOLLARS IN THAT HAS BROKEN OUT BETWEEN GENERAL FUND AT SIXTY SEVEN POINT NINE MILLION. FEDERAL FUND. AT A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY ONE POINT ONE MILLION. SPECIAL FUNDS TOTALING SIX MILLION DOLLARS ROUGHLY. REIMBURSEMENTS TOTALING THIRTEEN MILLION DOLLARS. AND AGAIN THAT BRINGS US TO A TOTAL OF TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS FOR OVERALL BUDGET. THE ONENOTE I WILL MAKE AS YOU'LL SEE IN THE AGENDA THERE IS A MARKED CHANGE FROM OUR PRIOR YEAR BUDGET TO OUR CURRENT YEAR BUDGET I JUST QUICKLY WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT. THAT IS DUE TO THE HOME AND COMMUNITY BASED SETTINGS SPENDING PLAN INVESTMENT TOTALING THREE HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS BEING INCLUDED IN OUR CURRENT YOUR BUDGET AS WELL AS- OUR FEDERAL FUND. BUDGET AUTHORITY BEING INCREASED TO ACCOUNT FOR THE VARIOUS DIFFERENT COVERT RELIEF FUNDS THAT ARE NOTED FURTHER DOWN THE AGENDA. NOT STAND I KNOW GOING TO GIVE IT A GO THROUGH OUR BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSALS. THE DEPARTMENT AGING HAD THREE PROPOSALS INCLUDED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. I'LL START WITH THE LARGEST ONE WHICH IS RESOURCES TO CONTINUE THE IMPLEMENTATION FOR THE MASTER PLAN FOR EACH. THE PROPOSAL PROVIDED TWO MILLION DOLLARS BEGINNING IN TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE. AND TURNING TO ONE POINT NINE MILLION DOLLARS IN TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR I'M GOING TO SUPPORT TWELVE NEW POSITIONS AT CDA- IN THE AREAS OF DATA AND RESEARCH. EQUITY IN TRIBAL LEADERSHIP. POLICY LEADERSHIP PUBLIC EXTERNAL AND STAKEHOLDER COMMUNICATIONS AS WELL AS ADDING A NEW FUNCTION WITH THE DEPARTMENT THE STATE PUBLIC GUARDIAN LIAISON. ADDITIONAL IN THE DEPARTMENT WAS PROVIDED WITH PROPOSED RESOURCES FOR A INCREASED ADMINISTRATIVE WORKLOAD DO YOU TO THE GROWTH OF THE DEPARTMENT AND TO CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THE MASTER PLAN ON AGING- AND THAT IS FOR ADDITIONAL POSITIONS TOTALING FIVE HUNDRED AND THIRTY SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS IN TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE- AND FIVE HUNDRED AND TWELVE THOUSAND DOLLARS IN TWENTY TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR AN ON GOING. THOSE FOR RESOURCES ARE SPLIT BETWEEN OUR HUMAN RESOURCES AND OUR BUSINESS SERVICES TOOL. ADDITIONALLY JUST A NOTE WE DID HAVE A TECHNICAL ADJUSTMENT BOZELL TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL POSITION OF FORTY TO TRUE UP OUR BUDGET FOR POSITIONS THAT WE HAVE BEEN FUNDING WITH EXISTING RESOURCES AND THAT IS A TOTAL OF EIGHT- EIGHT POSITION. EIGHT ADDITIONAL POSITIONS OR POSITION I FORTY FOUR EIGHT CURRENT STAFFING. IF YOU HAVEN'T PLEASE LET ME KNOW. AND NOW HEADING OFF TO MARK FACT WE ARE CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR. WELCOME CHIEF DEPUTY. AFTERNOON THAT YOU'RE EGGMAN IT'S GREAT TO BE HERE TODAY I WILL- ADDRESS THE QUESTIONS THE AGENDA. STARTING WITH THE FIRST QUESTION WHICH HAS TO DO WITH OUR NEW PROPOSED- PUBLIC CONSERVE YOUR LIAISON POSITION- AND THE QUESTION IS HOW WOULD THE REQUESTED POSITION ENSURE CONSISTENCY IN EQUITY AMONG ALL HE G. CA OFFICES STATEWIDE- SO CDA PROPOSES TO ESTABLISH- A RELATIONSHIP WITH THE LOCAL PUBLIC GUARDIAN OFFICES. AS IT RELATES TO THEIR PROBATE CONSERVATORSHIP FOR OLDER ADULTS- WE THINK THIS IS AT A CRITICAL RELATIONSHIP TO ESTABLISH AND WAS HIGHLIGHTED AS ONE OF THE KEY INITIATIVES IN THE MASTER PLAN FOR AGING- AS THE PUBLIC GUARDIAN'S PLAY A CRITICAL ROLE IN ENSURING THE HEALTH OF MATERIAL LEADS. FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO CANNOT CARE FOR THEMSELVES SUCH AS INDIVIDUALS WITH. COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENTS AND MENTAL AND PHYSICAL DISABILITIES AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ISSUES- WE SEE THE ROLE OF THE WAYS ON TO BRING TOGETHER ALL STAKEHOLDERS THAT- TOUCH PROBATE CONSERVATORSHIP. SERVICE WOULD INCLUDE LOCAL PAP'S GPC OFFICES PTA P. G. HE SI ESTAS SITUATION% AS WELL AS THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL- AND YOU KNOW OF COURSE THAT ALSO INCLUDED IN THOSE CONVERSATIONS OTHER ADVOCATES AND FAMILY MEMBERS- AND THE PURPOSE OF THIS DISCUSSION SHOULD REALLY BE TO IDENTIFY THE GAPS NEEDS AND OPPORTUNITIES. FOR PROBATE CONSERVATORSHIP AND- WHAT THIS POSITION WOULD DO IS REALLY TO TAKE A STATE WIDE VIEW OF THE LOCAL OFFICES- FOUNDATIONAL TO DOING THIS REVIEW AND ANALYSIS IS REALLY GOOD DATA. SO IN OUR CONVERSATIONS WITH THE PAP'S GPC ASSOCIATION. WHAT WE'VE-DISCOVERED IS THERE'S A LACK OF- STATEWIDE RELIABLE DATA AND- WHEN IT COMES TO THE NUMBER OF PROBATE CONSERVATORSHIP OF PUBLIC AND PRIVATE STATEWIDE- AS WELL AS THE DEMOGRAPHICS OF THE INDIVIDUALS- AND SURVIVE. AS A CONSERVATORSHIP. SO WHAT THIS ON DO IS REALLY- HOW. FACILITATE THE ACT COLLECTION OF THAT DATA AND TALK TO STAKEHOLDERS ABOUT THE TYPE OF DATA THAT NEEDS TO BE COLLECTED- ONCE WE HAVE THIS DATA COLLECTED THEN WE THINK THAT WE CAN HAVE REALLY GET MEANINGFUL DISCUSSIONS- ABOUT THE CASTING IT'S AN OPPORTUNITIES OF THE PROGRAM. AND REALLY START BUILDING TOWARDS A MORE CONSISTENT EQUITABLE- CONSERVATORSHIP PROGRAMS STATEWIDE- ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS ON THIS ITEM. SO YOU'RE YOU'RE A- THE ROLE THEN WILL BE FOR THIS PERSON TO COORDINATE WITH ALL THE LOCAL COUNTY PUBLIC GUARDIAN OFFICES AND SO RIGHT AND THIS LAYS ON THEN WILL BE. DEVELOPING THE DELETED DATA COLLECTION TOOL FOR THE DATA COLLECTION TOOLS ALREADY IN PLACE DO WE KNOW. WE'RE NOT AWARE THAT THERE IS I KNOW THAT- LOCAL PPG PC OFFICERS ATTEMPT TO COLLECT. DATA ON- THE CONSERVATORSHIP SOMETHING ESTABLISHING WHO THEY SERVE- WE THINK THAT THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL ALSO PLAYS A CRITICAL ROLE AS THEY KEEP ALL OF THESE CONSERVE SHIPS ON FILE. SO WE REALLY SEE IT AS BEING A COLLABORATIVE PROCESS AND WORKING WITH THE STAKEHOLDERS TO. DETERMINE THE DATA THAT NEEDS TO BE COLLECTED AND THEN DETERMINING WHO'S THE BEST NGH YOU CENTRALLY COLLECT THIS DATA WHETHER IT'S CA OR ANOTHER AND SHE- BUT DEFINITELY THIS LAYS ON WOULD BRING. ALL THE DATA TOGETHER AND HOPEFULLY PRESENT IN THE FORM O DASHBOARD- THAT WOULD BE EASILY TO UNDERSTAND AND ACCESSIBLE AND DO DO WE HAVE ANY IDEA AT THIS POINT. AND I'VE BEEN TALKING A LOT WITH THE PUBLIC GUARDIAN'S FOLKS DO WE HAVE ANY IDEA. AND THESE BY DEFINITION ARE OLDER ADULTS WITHOUT A LOT OF. YOUR SOCIAL SUPPORT AT THREE UNDER A CONSERVATORSHIP DO WE HAVE ANY IDEA WHERE THEY'RE WITH WHERE THEY ARE PHYSICALLY OR THE END. OF THE INTRACELLULAR LICENSE OR THE IMPORTANT CARERS ARE THEY STILL AT HOME WITH SUPPORTS. DO YOU HAVE ANY DATA ON THAT YET. HE DOWN AND YOU KNOW MY UNDERSTANDING IS THERE IN A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT SETTINGS. BUT THAT'S EXACTLY THE REASON WHY I WOULD WANT TO ESTABLISH THIS POSITION IS SO THAT WE CAN- GO THROUGH THAT PROCESS OF COLLECTING THAT DATA UNDERSTANDING WHERE- FOLKS ARE HOUSED IN PLACE- AS WELL AS LOOKING AT PLACEMENT ISSUES- YOU KNOW OBVIOUS. WAY WITH THE INCREASE IN THE HOMELESS POPULATION AND OLDER ADULTS- BECOMING YOU KNOW A YOU KNOW A MAJOR PART OF THE HOMELESS POPULATION- I THINK THAT WOULD BE ANOTHER PART OF THE CONVERSATION IS. LICENSE I ALSO WANT TO MENTION I THINK THAT WE- HAD NEWLY ESTABLISHED WHAT WE CALL AN ELDER DISABILITY. JUSTICE COORDINATING COUNCIL I WITHIN THE ADMINISTRATION. AND WE THINK THAT THIS WOULD BE A GOOD PLACE TO HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS AS WE BRING A VARIETY OF. DIFFERENT STAKEHOLDERS TOGETHER- THAT YOU KNOW DEAL WITH- ELDER JUSTICE RIGHTS. AS WELL AS- YOU KNOW WE COULD ALSO REACH OUT TO HOUSING STAKEHOLDERS AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS I CAN ALSO. BENEFIT PEOPLE. WHO ARE IN CONSERVATORSHIP. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SURE OKAY I WILL MOVE ON TO THE NEXT QUESTION A GENDER WHICH IS- PLEASE DESCRIBE THE GROWTH IN THE MSSP PROGRAM ANALYSIS GROWTH HAS. AND WILL IMPACT ISOLATION AND WELL BEING AMONG SENIORS- SO THE MSSP PROGRAM IS A PROGRAM THAT WE ARE VERY- IOTA- YOU KNOW THE KEY BENEFIT. THE MULTI SERVICES SENIOR SERVICES PROGRAM IS TO ENABLE INDIVIDUALS TO STAY IN THEIR HOMES AND TO HAVE- HEALTH AND CARE MANAGEMENT- FROM THEIR HOMES- YOU'RE A TEAM OF NURSES SOCIAL WORKERS. ORDINATING WITH HEALTH CARE AND SHE'S. SO IN THE CURRENT YEAR THE LEGISLATURE DID APPROVE AN AUGMENTATION TO ALLOW. THE MSSP PROGRAM TO RETURN TO THAT TOTAL NUMBER OF SLOTS IT HAD. PRIOR TO THE- RECESSION SO BACK TO ITS TWO THOUSAND EIGHT LEVEL. OF ELEVEN THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED FORTY SLOTS THAT'S TWO THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED FIFTY SEVEN- NEXT NEW SLOTS STATEWIDE- AND SO THE- MSSPS SITES ARE IN THE PROCESS RIGHT NOW OF STAFFING AFTER THE SLOTS. THE SPONSOR JUST RECENTLY APPROVED BY CMS AND BECOME EFFECTIVE JANUARY FIRST SO THEY HAVE A STACKED STAFFING ACTIVELY UNDER WAY- WE SEE MULTIPLE ADVANTAGES- FOR PARTICIPANTS IN THE MISSISSIPPI PROGRAM. AS I MENTIONED TO BE- HEALTH MANAGEMENT. THEY HAVE A NURSE AND A SOCIAL WORKER ASSIGNED TO THEM THEY ARE- THEY RECEIVE A COMPREHENSIVE ASSESSMENT TO UNDERSTAND ALL THEIR PHYSICAL HEALTH AND AT BEHAVIORAL HEALTH NEEDS. AND MEDICARE PLAN IS PUT TOGETHER AND IT'S ACTIVELY MONITORED MANAGED THROUGH. ON THE SOCIAL WORKER AND THROUGH- NURSING STAFF AND AS CONDITIONS WITH THE PATIENT CHANGE OBVIOUSLY THEIR CARE PLAN ON CHANGES- RELATED ISOLATION WE THINK THAT THE CARE TEAM. DEFINITELY PROVIDES MUCH NEEDED SOCIAL CONNECTION- TO THE INDIVIDUALS SO THEY MEET WITH THEM- PERIODICALLY- SOMETIMES AS MUCH S WEEKLY OR MULTIPLE TIMES A WEEK DEPENDING ON WHAT THEIR CARE SITUATIONS. SO THEY GET CONNECTION ARM- AND THEN ON IF THEY HAVE ANY PAYROLL HEALTH NAY TO. BY THE CHURCH. I I'D SAY IN KNOW AGAIN THE KEY IS REALLY A FOLKS ROOM IN THEIR HOME AND DO THAT THIS HAS A POSITIVE IMPACT IN MITIGATING ISOLATION AND LONELINESS AND THAT IF SOMEBODY CAN STAY IN THEIR HOMES IN THEIR COMMUNITIES THEY'RE MORE LIKELY TO BE CLOSE MORE CLOSELY CONNECTED TO FAMILY AND FRIENDS WITHIN THEIR COMMUNITIES SO YEAH WE DO THINK OVERALL THE AMNESTY PROGRAM SERVES. A VALUABLE ROLE AND I'M MEDICAID ASIC MITIGATING SOCIAL ISOLATION. AND PROVIDING FOR EFFECTIVE CARE MANAGEMENT- ANY QUESTIONS ON THIS ITEM HAVE YOU GO THROUGH ALL OF THE MINIMAL OKAY. OKAY TEAM. OKAY WE'LL MOVE ON TO THE- QUESTION ON THE TRESTLE. THE QUESTION IS THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET ACT- PROVIDED ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO PROVIDE MORE MEALS AND SUPPORT INFRASTRUCTURE CAPACITY FOR THE SENIOR NUTRITION PROGRAM. HOW HAS THE STATE MAY PROGRESS IN ADDRESSING HUNGER AMONG OLDER ADULTS. HOW ARE INFRASTRUCTURE AND CAPACITY FUNDS BEING USED AND WHAT CHALLENGES HAVE THE PROGRAM SPACE DURING THE PANDEMIC AND HOUSES STATE OVERCOME THEM. SO I'LL START OFF AN EXAM OF THE ME PROGRAM WHICH WAS EXTRAORDINARY INSIGNIFICANT DURING THE PANDEMIC. SO THE STATE WAS ABLE TO INCREASE ITS MALES. BY NINE POINT FIVE MILLION AND THAT IS ALL THANKS TO OUR LOCAL AREA AGENCY ON AGING- PARTNERS AS WELL AS OUR NUTRITION PROVIDERS. HI THERE THIS SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE 52% INCREASE APPROPRIATE PANDEMIC LEVELS. AND SO THE TOTAL NUMBER OF MEALS SERVED IN THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE FISCAL YEAR. WAS TWENTY SEVEN MILLION FIVE HUNDRED TWENTY THREE THOUSAND SO. YES AN EXTRAORDINARY RISE AN INCREASE IN TOTAL- MEALS SERVED FIRE PROGRAMS- THERE'S A QUITE ABOUT ME VIA EMAIL GAP- THAT CURRENTLY EXISTS IN CALIFORNIA AND MODEL POINTS YOU HERE'S CHU STUDIES- THE FIRST STUDY AS DONE BY A NONPROFIT CALLED FEEDING AMERICA AND THEY PUBLISH AN ANNUAL REPORT ALL THE STATE OF SENIOR HUNGER IN AMERICA- SO THEY DIDN'T UPDATE FOR THE TWENTY NINETEEN CALENDAR YEAR. AND WHAT THEY ESTIMATE IS UP THIRTY SIX POINT THREE CALIFORNIANS OLDER ADULTS IN CALIFORNIA THAT HAVE SOME LEVEL OF FOOD INSECURITY AND ONE POINT NINE MILLION OR ONE POINT 9% EXCUSE ME AN EXPERIENCE VERY LOW- FOOD INSECURITY- AND THEN RECENTLY IN THE FALL A CONSULTANT- DINA JOHNSTON- DID A STUDY ON BEHALF OF THE LOCAL AREA AGENCY ON AGING ASSOCIATION. DID YOU A MAIL GAP ANALYSIS AS WELL AND WHAT THEY FOUND IS APPROVED AND THEN MAKE BASS MADE AT THE TOTAL MEAL GAP TO BE EIGHT HUNDRED FORTY TWO MILLION MALES ARE FOR OLDER ADULTS IN CALIFORNIA. AND DURING THE PANDEMIC THROUGH ALL THE NUMEROUS- AUGMENTATIONS THAT WERE RECEIVED BY CALFRESH THE FOOD BANKS- OLDER AMERICANS ACT PROGRAMS AS WELL AS THE OTHER EMAIL PROGRAMS STATEWIDE THE FACT GAP IT SHRUNK BY FOUR HUNDRED SEVENTY TWO MILLION MEALS TWO TO THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY MILLION MALES WE'RE STILL ANALYZING THAT REPORT- AND MEETING WITH STAKEHOLDERS TO DISCUSS IT AND- WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO TRACK- REFINERY OR ESTIMATES. OF THE GAP- IN CALIFORNIA BUT WE DEFINITELY THINK THAT THE ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS RECEIVED DURING HAVE IT MADE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON- SENIOR HUNGER AND SENIOR NUTRITION. DURING THE PANDEMIC. AND THEN INTO OF- CHALLENGE ARE FACED BY- OUR PROVIDER DURING THE CARE IT AND I CAN. I AM THE OUTSET OF THE PANDEMIC- DEFINITELY. SENATE JOHN RAMPS UP THERE'S A LOT AT ASTON- BUT BECAUSE NEWS IS FIVE AWAITS OF TWENTY TWENTY EARLY FALL- WE'VE SEEN A RAPID AND SIGNIFICANT GROWTH IN THEIR CAPACITY TO SERVE- OLDER ADULTS- SO THEY REALLY IN A STEP FORWARD AND WERE ABLE TO RAMP UP QUICKLY- MORE RECENTLY- A CHALLENGE THAT WE'RE SEEING IS- THE RESUMPTION AND OF. IN PERSON OR CONGREGATE MEAL SITES. SO THE STATE HAD PUT TOGETHER A PROGRAM MEMO LAST SUMMER. AND IN THE- LOCAL AREA AGENCY ON AGING ASSOCIATION OR C. FOR A- AB PUBLISHED A BEST PRACTICES RESOURCE AND TOOL KIT. TO A SYSTEM BE- REOPENING SAFE OPENING OF CONGREGATE SITES- THAT WAS DELAYED DUE TO THE ONSET OF DELTA AND THE OMICRON VIRUS- BUT WE'RE HOPING AS- THE- VIRUS SUBSIDES AND AS- HAS KIDS AND YOU KNOW. HE GOT MORE AVAILABLE AND CONGREGATE SITES ARE ABLE TO RESTRUCTURE TO PROVIDE SAFE MAIL DELIVERY. THAT PROVIDERS WILL BE ABLE TO REVIEW RESUME CONGREGATE ON SERVICES- THIS YEAR. IN THEN I WILL ON TO. AND THE LAST QUESTION WHICH DEALS WITH OUR EIGHT R. C. CERVICAL IS A WHAT WOULD TAKE EXPAND- BAT R. C. SYSTEMS SAY. AND WE THINK THAT THERE'S MULTIPLE STEPS INVOLVED IN MASS FIRST AND FOREMOST IS ESTABLISHING PARTNERSHIPS BETWEEN OUR LOCAL AREA AGENCIES ON AGING AND- INDEPENDENT LIVING CENTERS I IN ALL COUNTIES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA THERE ARE EXISTING PARTNERSHIPS AND WERE VERY PROUD TO REPORT. THAT WE HAVE- INCREASE THE NUMBER OF WELL WE ALL CALL DESIGNATED OR ESTABLISHED PROGRAMS FROM SIX TO FIFTEEN AND WE HAVE INCREASED THE NUMBER OF EMERGING PROGRAMS- IN THE STATE AS WELL SO CURRENTLY THIRTY COUNTIES HAVE EITHER AN ESTABLISHED OR DEVELOPING A OR C. THAT COVERS SO WE ARE SEEING POSITIVE GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT- SO WHAT THE STATE'S FOCUS SAYS IN COLLABORATION WITH OUR PARTNERS AT DEPARTMENT REHABILITATION THAT OVERSEES THE INDEPENDENT LIVING CENTERS ESTERLY STRONGLY ENCOURAGE AND PARTNRSHIPS BETWEEN- TRIPLE A.'S ANALYSES I DON'T CURRENTLY HAVE AN ADRC. AND SO WE'RE- WE'RE WORKING A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT- DIFFERENT COUNTIES TO HERE I HAD TO EXPAND THE NUMBER OF. EIGHTY OUR SEASON WE HAVE. MOREOVER URBAN COUNTIES DON'T HAVE THEM. IT'S A MIX WHY MY FRANKLY- I WOULD SAY YOU KNOW ONE AREA THAT WE'RE YOU KNOW LOOKING AT IS BAD LOS ANGELES FOR INSTANCE WHICH CURRENTLY HAS AN ADRC IN JUST ONE PART OF. THE CITY AND SO WHAT WE'RE REALLY LOOKING TO EXPAND THAT YOU KNOW AFTER ON ALL OF THE LOS ANGELES REGION- BUT YOU KNOW THE OTHERS THERE ARE I WOULD SAY IT'S REALLY PRETTY SPREAD OUT BETWEEN THE NORTH CENTRAL CALIFORNIA- SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA COUNTIES. THANK. SERVICE ANOTHER EFFORTS ARE UNDERTAKING TO- REALLY- AND I GUESS CAREFULLY AND METHODICALLY EXPAND THE EIGHTY OUR SEEDS IS BRANDING SO WHEN I SAY ADRC I DON'T THINK IF I WERE TO SAY THAT YOU YOU KNOW ONE OF MY FRIENDS OR SOMEBODY ON THE STREET THEY WOULD REALLY KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS SURLY THINKING PEOPLE DON'T KNOW WHAT HALF OF OUR INITIALS ARE THAT'S TRUE THAT'S TRUE. THEY'RE TRYING TO THINK OF A MORE- MAYBE DESCRIPTIVE- AT. BETTER DESCRIPTOR FOR THE PROGRAM SEARCHES ONE DOOR. BECAUSE REALLY THE PURPOSE OF THE UNIVERSITIES IS TO ACT AS ACTIVEWEAR ENTRYWAY INTO ALL. COMMITTEE SERVICES AVAILABLE TO OLDER ADULTS AND INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES AND THEIR COMMUNITIES. SO YEAH I THINK BRANDING IS GOING TO BE A BIT VERY BIG PART OF THIS IF WE CAN BRAND OURSELVES FRANKLY I THINK THAT MORE PEOPLE WILL BE. UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT WE DO AND MORE WILLING TO I USE OUR SERVICES- A SECOND PART OF THAT IS REALLY ACCESS TO SERVICES. SO WE'VE BEEN TALKING A LOT ABOUT BUILDING MAYBE A CUSTOMER PORTAL WHERE FOLKS CAN. GO ONLINE AND INTERACT- TO YOU KNOW PUT OUT REFER REQUESTS FOR SERVICES AND THEN GET REFERRALS FACT- AS WELL AS CREATING MORE CONSISTENT. ASKING WHY TELEPHONE STRUCTURE OF. FOLKS WHO ARE CONNECTED. TO BROADBAND OR THE INTERNET CAN STILL PICK UP ON AND ACCESS SERVICES THAT WAY SURLY LOOKING AT MULTIPLE ENTRY POINTS. AND MULTIPLE WAYS THAT PEOPLE CAN ACCESS OUR SERVICES. AND THEN THERE'S ALL THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT GOES BEHIND- SETTING UP IT ACTUALLY STATEWIDE SYSTEM. WHICH IS TRAINING SO ENSURING THAT WE'VE GOT GOOD PERSON CENTER TRAINING. TRAINING ON ASSESSMENT TOOLS- TRAINING ON ACCESSING SERVICES AND TRANSITION SERVICES. FOR ALL OF OUR ADRC PARTNERS USE- AND THEN ESTABLISHING GOOD GOVERNANCE PROCESS TO RECEIVE THE PROGRAM AND MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE. MAKING CHANGES TO THE PROGRAM WHEN APPROPRIATE- BUT YEAH SO THOSE ARE SOME OF THE KEY- HE ASKED STEPS WE THANK. WELL I GUESS ALL THIS MENTION ONE OTHER THING WHICH IS. THE KEY ROLE THAT HEALTH PARTNERSHIPS PLAY- IN THE A OR C. SYSTEM. RIGHT NOW WE YOU KNOW WORK MAINLY WITH- COMMITTEE BASED ORGANIZATIONS BUT WE REALLY DO WANT TO ESTABLISH MORE PARTNERSHIPS WITH HEALTH CARE ORGANIZATIONS SINCE WE SHARE THE SAME. IN OUR INDIVIDUALS AMONG SIR PROGRAM. AND SO THAT WE CAN REALLY DO. WHOLE PERSON PERSON CENTRED SIR INDIVIDUALS AND SERVE. OKAY- SO THAT IS MY PRESENT. IF THERE'S ANY ON HAPPY TO ANSWER THEM OKAY THANK YOU CAN WE TO THE A. L. YES HELLO- IT WITH REGARDS TO THE SPECIFIC BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSALS WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF AGING. I'M WERE STILL COMPLETING OUR TECHNICAL REVIEW BUT AS OF NOW NO IMMEDIATE CONCERNS WILL DEFINITELY FOLLOW UP ON WHAT THE COMMITTEE IF ANYTHING COMES UP- IN TERMS OF THE OVERVIEW OF AUGMENTATIONS. TO PROGRAMS MADE LAST YEAR- SIMILAR TO WHAT THE CHAIR EXPRESSED WE ALSO IN OUR BROADER OVERVIEW OF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET SUGGESTED THAT THE LEGISLATURE DO THAT- OVERSIGHT- OF. THE PROPOSALS THAT WERE INCLUDED IN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET GETTING AN UPDATE ON IMPLEMENTATION ESPECIALLY GETTING AN UPDATE ON THE IMPLEMENTATION CHALLENGES SO THAT. THE LEGISLATURE AS A PART OF THIS BUDGET CYCLE CAN CONSIDER- IF ANYTHING COULD BE DONE TO MITIGATE THOSE IMPLEMENTATION CHALLENGES BUT THEN ALSO I'M TO THE EXTENT THAT WE'RE STARTING TO GET. OUT PROGRAM OUTCOMES FROM SOME OF THOSE PRIOR AUGMENTATIONS- GETTING A REPORT BACK ON THOSE SO THEN THE LEGISLATURE HAS A BETTER SENSE OF- WHAT ABOUT THE SPECIFIC PROGRAM NEEDS TO BE EXPANDED- BISHOP SHOULD THOSE ONE TIME INVESTMENT SPEAK CARRY FORWARD. ON AN ONGOING BASIS- AS IT RELATES TO BE DEPARTMENT OF BEIJING SPECIFICALLY I WAS MENTIONED- THERE WERE A FEW PROPOSALS THAT ARE A PART OF THIS BROADER HOME AND COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES SPENDING PLAN THAT THE STATE WAS REQUIRED TO SUBMIT TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. WE RECENTLY RECEIVED FEDERAL- CONDITIONAL FEDERAL. IMPLEMENTATION ACTIVITIES FOR THOSE PROPOSALS. AND SO AS THOSE IMPLEMENTATION ACTIVITIES ARE ROLLING OUT AS A PART OF THIS BUDGET PROCESS THE LEGISLATURE JUST MAY WANT TO REQUEST FROM THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE DEPARTMENT TO BE KEPT UP TO DATE ON THOSE IMPLEMENTATION ACTIVITIES AND CHALLENGES DO ARISE IN THE NEXT FEW MONTHS. WE JUST RAISING THOSE FOR OUR AWARENESS AND ALSO TO THE EXTENT THAT THEIR SPECIFIC PROPOSAL THAT THE LEGISLATURE WOULD LIKE TO TRACK THE PROGRAM OUTCOMES. THAT WERE NOT ADOPTED IN STATUTE THE LEGISLATURE MAY WANT TO CONSIDER- WHETHER FOR CERTAIN PROPOSALS AND- ADAPTING TO A SPECIFIC PROGRAM REPORTING REQUIREMENTS- THAT MAKES SENSE SO THEN WE CAN ENSURE THAT WE'RE TRACKING- AND THE IMPACTS THAT THOSE PROGRAMS HAVE. AND THEN ALSO- IT'LL HELP THE LEGISLATURE THINK ABOUT THE ONGOING NATURE OF THOSE PROGRAM ACTIVITIES MOVING FORWARD. THANK YOU THANK. YOU VERY MUCH THE PARTNER FINANCE. YOU'RE OKAY. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH- I'M WONDERING IF THE IF I DIRECTOR TOMORROW'S WOULD LIKE TO. LAST YEAR WE JUST TRY TOREALLY KEEP GOING BACK AND FOCUSING ON ON THE FIVE COMPONENTS OF THE BIGOTED OF CHOICE AND YOU CAN GET TO TALK ABOUT THAT MUCH I WONDER IF YOU WANT TO GO OVER THAT A LITTLE BIT. AND AS YOU GO OVER THOSE THEN BE ABLE TO WORK AND TALKING ABOUT SOME OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF SOME OF THE AUGMENTATIONS THAT WE'VE DONE. AND THAT'S ONE OF THINGS THAT WE ASKED ABOUT LAST YEAR IF WE COULD KEEP REFERRING BACK TO THOSE FIVE THE GOALS AND HOW HOW THESE- AB. HOW THEY'RE MEETING THE GOALS WORKING TOWARDS AT SOME MONEY IF YOU JUST WANT TO GO OVER THOSE AGAIN JUST TO KIND OF HIGHLIGHT A BECAUSE I THINK IT IS BEAUTIFUL AND TRANSFORMATIVE. AND I AM ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO TURN SIXTY THIS YEAR SO I REALLY REALLY REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT HER CARE OF SENIORS- AND THEN. SPECIFIC AUGMENTATIONS THAT YOU WANT TO GIVE AN UPDATE ON. AND OR ANY IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES THAT YOU'RE YOU'RE YOU'RE TO GRAPPLING WITH RIGHT NOW. THANK YOU SENATOR I'M HAPPY AND I. FOR THE SECOND TIME I DID NOT GO TO- INTO DETAIL ON THE FIVE BIG GOALS OF THE MASTER PLAN FOR AGING SO JUST TO RECAP FOR YOU IN THE AUDIENCE- THE FIRST GOAL IS HOUSING FOR ALL AGES AND STAGES. SECOND GOAL IS HEALTH REIMAGINED. OUR THIRD GOAL IS INCLUSION AND EQUITY NOT ISOLATION. THE FOURTH GOAL IS CARE GIVING THAT WORKS AND THAT GOAL INCLUDES BOTH THE DIRECT CARE PAID WORK FORCE- THROUGH- SOCIAL WORKERS NURSES PHYSICIANS AND FRONTLINE WORKERS INCLUDING AYE AND JUSTICE. AS WELL AS THE UNPAID FAMILY CAREGIVERS UNDER GOALS FOR. AND THEN THE PHYSICAL IS ACCORDING AGING AND SO THAT'S REALLY LOOKING AT THE ECONOMIC IMPACT- ON OLDER ADULTS AND- MANY OF THE SS I SS P. AND MEDIKAL- ISSUES. SENIOR PROPERTY SO WITHIN THOSE FIVE. GOAL AREAS I WOULD SAY- THERE'S IMPLEMENTATION- HAPPENING ACROSS AGENCIES AND DEPARTMENTS- I'M SO IMPRESSED IN MY SHORT TIME THAT WERE WORKING. SO COLLABORATIVELY THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY ALONG WITH HOUSING LABOR. AND OTHER AGENCIES AS WELL AS WITH IN THAT CALIFORNIA HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY WERE WORKING SO CLOSELY WITH OUR SISTER DEPARTMENTS BECAUSE- THE- TEN YEAR BLUEPRINT IS SO COMPREHENSIVE IT INCLUDES. A VARIETY OF AGENCIES AND DEPARTMENTS TO ENSURE THAT HOUSING TRANSPORTATION. HEALTH SOCIAL SERVICES ARE ALL INCLUDED AND ADDRESSED SO I'LL LET MY TEAM TALK ABOUT SPECIFICS TO THE DEPARTMENT OF AGING- WE DON'T. OWN ALL OF THE INITIATIVES- THOUGH WE DO TRACK AND MONITOR AND WE WERE SO PROUD. TO SHARE THE ONE YEAR PROGRESS REPORT WITH THE LEGISLATURE JUST A FEW WEEKS AGO AND WE'LL MAKE SURE THAT YOU. HAVE A COPY OF THAT WHERE WE- PROVIDED PROGRESS ON ALL OF THE INITIATIVES I THINK WELL OVER. A HUNDRED- HAVE HAD ACTIVITY- IN THE LAST JUST THE LAST YEAR ALONE. AND WE REFERRED TO THE DEPARTMENT OR AGENCY THAT IS RESPONSIBLE. FOR THE ACTIVITY. AND FOR AN ENERGY TURN IT OVER TO YOUR DEBORAH. CAN YOU ALSO SPEAK A LITTLE TO ALL OF THAT COORDINATE BECAUSE I DO THINK IT'S INCREDIBLY IMPRESSIVE AND ANY TIME YOU DEVELOP A SYSTEM THAT GOES ACROSS MULTIPLE DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES THERE. THERE IS A THAT'S EXCITING WHEN IT WORKS WELL BUT THEN THERE'S ALSO THE OPPORTUNITY FOR LEFT HAND RIGHT HAND- AND I KNOW THE GOAL IS TO DEVELOP A ONE DOOR APPROACH AND SO PERHAPS YOUR THEY CAN ALSO SPEAK TO THE- THE DATA COLLECTION THAT WERE ALL THAT MAKING SURE THAT THE COORDINATION IS OCCURRING. SEAMLESSLY GREAT AND TO YOUR POINT THE GOAL IS TO MAKE THIS AS SEAMLESS AND STREAMLINED FOR THE END USER. THE FOR THE CONSUMER THE OLDER ADULT THE MEDICARE BENEFICIARY WHOEVER'S. ACCESSING THE SERVICES AND SUPPORTS THAT- IT'S INVISIBLE TO THEM AND THAT TAKES A LOT OF WORK BEHIND. BEHIND THE CURTAIN TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN AND YOU KNOW OUR SECRETARY SECRETARY- DOCTOR GALLEON TALKS ABOUT SILO BUSTING AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT ALL OF US IN THE AGENCY ARE ENCOURAGED. TO DO IN OUR WORK- TO REALLY WORK- WITH OUR SISTER DEPARTMENTS AND THERE'S- A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF COLLABORATION AND PARTNERSHIP HAPPENING- RIGHT NOW SO I'LL LET THOMAS AND MARK TALK ABOUT. SOME OF THE SPECIFICS IN THE MASTER PLAN THAT ARE ASSIGNED TO THE DEPARTMENT OF AGING AND IM READY PUTTING UP. ACTION FILM. SILENT QUESTIONS. YEAH SO- GLAD GLAD DO THAT- SURE EGGMAN SO- I THINK WE'LL START OFF BY SAYING YOU MENTIONED- CHALLENGES AND- YOU KNOW SORT OF THE STATUS OF WHERE WE ARE WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF OUR VARIOUS PROJECTS. ALL HAVE LIKE MAYBE FIVE KEY INITIATIVES THAT WE HAVE UNDER WAY IN THE CURRENT YEAR- BUT WHAT I'LL SAY ABOUT ALL OF THESE IS. THERE IS A CERTAIN LEVEL OF INFRASTRUCTURE BUILDING THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE AT THE OUTSET AND I THINK WHAT I WANT TO SAY IS. YOU KNOW THANKS SO MUCH LEGISLATURE FOR UP PROVIDING OR APPROVING OR SUPPORTING ALL THESE AUGMENTATIONS AND ALL THESE NEW INITIATIVES. THAT WE HAVE THE PRIVILEGE TO REALLY BUILD AND GROW- IT'S A VERY EXCITING TIME FR THE DEPARTMENT OF AGING TO. BE ABLE TO. EXPAND OUR PROGRAM SERVICES TO SERVE NEW CLIENTS- IN NEW WAYS. AND SO YOU KNOW WE'RE JUST EXCITED. OVERALL JUST TO HAVE THIS OPPORTUNITY. SO YEAH WHAT ELSE IS- IN. RECEIVE THESE ARE. THERE IS A LOT OF INFRASTRUCTURE BUILDING THAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT. AND WHAT THAT CONSISTS OF COURSE IS HIRING STAFF. AND I THINK WHAT'S REALLY CRITICAL THERE IS HIRING THE RIGHT STAFF SO. WE'VE BEEN DOING A LOT OVER. THE FIRST SIX MONTHS. TO GET RECRUITMENTS OUT TO- GO THROUGH MULTIPLE ROUNDS OF INTERVIEWS AND RECRUITING TRULY FINE CAPABLE LEADERS FOR EACH ONE OF THESE- KEY INITIATIVES. WE'RE HAPPY TO SAY ABOUT THE RECRUITING IS GOING UP VERY WELL- FOR INSTANCE WE HAVE TWO NEW KIDS ACTED IN CENTRAL AND- CALIFORNIA PART OF AGING- WHO'S EVER KNEW- DIVISION OF AGING POLICY RESEARCH. AND EQUITY SHALL WE OVERSEEING ONE OF OUR KEY INITIATIVES WHICH IS. OUR HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DIRECT CARE WORKFORCE NINE I HSS FRANCE SO THERE IS- WE HIRED A CONSULTANT AND- THERE WERE RIGHT NOW WORKING WITH THAT CONSULTANT IN HIRING. A PERMANENT STATE LEADER OF THAT PROGRAM. SO RIGHT NOW WE'RE IN THE SCOPING PROCESS OF THAT PARTICULAR PROGRAM- WE ALSO HIRED- BONTA KASTRO WHO IS LEARNING STATE LONG TERM CARE OMBUDSMAN. SO ONE OF THE KEY- PRIORITIES OF HER AND WITH. THE ADDITIONAL AUGMENTATION WE RECEIVED FROM THE LEGISLATURE TO YEARS AGO IS REALLY EXPAND. THE VISITS TO NURSING HOMES AND RESIDENTIAL CARE FACILITIES FOR THE- ELDERLY STATEWIDE. AND WE HAVE SEEN SOME REALLY GOOD PROGRESS IN THE INCREASE OF THOSE VISITS. ANOTHER KEY EXECUTIVE HIGHER THAT WE NEED TO GENERATE WAS. LAST SEASON RODRIGUEZ WHO IS NOW OUR NEW- OFFICE OF THE STAKE CARE LONG TERM PATIENT REPRESENTATIVE. CERVANTES NEW PROGRAM THAT WAS SET UP. TO PROVIDE REPRESENTATION FOR. INDIVIDUALS IN SKILLED NURSING AND INTERMEDIATE CARE FACILITIES BRING CAPACITATE IT AND I AM ABLE TO MAKE THEIR OWN HEALTH. DECISIONS- THIS PUBLIC PATIENT REPRESENTATIVES STEPS. INDEX THREE. AND RIVER OUR WISHES- WHEN THERE'S NO FOR OR FOR OR ABLE DO SO- SO THAT PROGRAM WE AN- HAVING LONG BY. JULY OF THIS YEAR. AND SERVICE. FROM WORKING IMPLEMENTATION. AND WE ARE GOING TO BE MEETING WITH STAKEHOLDERS WITHIN THE NEXT TWO WEEKS WHICH INCLUDES CAFFEINE CANNER- AND OTHER- NURSING HOME ADVOCATES- TRULY- STAND UP THIS EXCITING NEW PROGRAM- ANOTHER INITIATIVE ALL HIGHLIGHT AS ADULT FAMILY HOMES WHICH IS THE FIRST. HOUSING PROGRAM THAT- THE DEPARTMENT OF BEIJING HAS OPERATED. SO THE ADULT FAMILY HOMES IS MODELED AFTER DDS IS SUCCESSFUL FAMILY HOMES AGENCY. PROGRAM WHICH PLACES INDIVIDUALS AND IN OUR CASE INDIVIDUALS WITH COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENTS INTO THE HOMES OF FAMILIES- SO THAT THEY CAN FEEL PART OF A FAMILY UNIT AND RECEIVE THE BENEFITS- OF BEING PART OF A FAMILY UNIT. SO WE ARE RIGHT NOW IN THE PROCESS OF HIRING BELIEVE FOR THAT PROGRAM. BUT WE HAVE BEEN IN CONVERSATION WITH GDS THEY'RE GOING TO REALLY HELP US AS STAND UP THIS NEW PROGRAM- THE PROGRAM IS TO- PLACE OBSCENITY. BILLS IN ONE COUNTY- ITO FAMILY HOMES. SO- WE SHOULD SOME GOOD PROP ON THAT THIS TIME- I'D SAY UNDER. OUR GOAL OF AYE INCLUDE EQUITY NOT ISOLATION SO DID SERVICES HAS REALLY BEEN A BIG PARTY FOR THE DEPARTMENT- WITH THE ONSET OF THE COVERT PANDEMIC- WE REALLY SAW THE NEED TO EXPAND. THE DEPLOYMENT OF TABLETS AND- SERVICE PLANS AND TRAINING TO OLDER ADULTS WHO DID NOT PREVIOUSLY USED SOCIAL SERVICES- WE KNOW A LOT OF THEM ARE EXPERIENCING ISOLATION AND LONELINESS YOU TO STAYING AT HOME AND BEING RESTRICTED FROM FAMILIES AND FRIENDS. SO WE- UNDERTOOK A PROJECT TO DEPLOY FOUR THOUSAND I'VE HAD STATEWIDE- I WEIGH ABOUT SEVENTY EIGHT HUNDRED OF THOSE HAVE BEEN DEPLOYED SO FAR. AND THEREST SHOULD BE DEPLOYED WITHIN THE NEXT COUPLE OF MONTHS- WE ALSO HAVE TWO OTHER JUDICIAL AND INCIDENTS. WHICH IS AT A FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS AND- DIGITAL GRANTS CHIU- COUNTIES. AND SO WE ARE GOING TO BE MEETING WITH- V. COUNTY WELFARE DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION THIS FRIDAY. TO TALK ABOUT ALLOCATION METHODOLOGY IN STRUCTURES OF THAT PROGRAM. WITH THE GOAL. OF GETTING THOSE. HENCE DONE BY LATE SOME EARLY FALL. AND THEN ALSO HAVE SOME MILI AND- FOR THAT WAS. FOR HOME AND BASED SERVICE FOR. SO RIGHT NOW OUR TEAM THE SKIP OUT THAT PROJECT. WHO ARE NATURAL PARTNERS WOULD BE FOR THAT PROGRAM AND THEN. ONCE WE DO THAT WILL EXECUTE CONTRACTS AND AGAIN THAT PROGRAMS PROBABLY LOOKING TO BE MAYBE- UP AND RUNNING BY THE FALL- THOSE YOU KNOW THOSE ARE ONLY THAT THE BIG SHE- INITIATIVES THAT WE ARE CURRENTLY TRACKING- SUSAN OR THOMAS- LET ME KNOW IF I MISSED ANYTHING. THIS IS THOMAS CAMERON AGAIN OUR MARKET YOU COVERED THE DAVIS- BUT THERE'S A COUPLE THAT I JUST WANTED TO TOUCH ON AS WELL IN ADDITION TO WHAT YOU MENTIONED ABOUT THE DEPARTMENT ALSO LAST YEAR DID RECEIVE INCREASED BASELINE FUNDING FOR OUR SENIOR TRISH WILL PROGRAM TO INCREASE OUR CAPACITY AROUND MEALS- AND I BELIEVE THAT IS A- THIRTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS THIS YEAR THEY'LL TURN TO THIRTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. ONGOING WE DID GET THOSE DOLLARS OUT OF THE BEGINNING OF THE FISCAL YEAR TO OUR LOCAL AREA AGENCIES ON AGING AND THEY HAVE STARTED TO EXPAND THOSE DOLLARS- AND CONTINUE TO EXPAND THEIR CAPACITY- IN ADDITION BUSINESS CONFORMANT- LIKE MEALS ON WHEELS OR VOUCHERS FOR FOOD. BUT SOUND LIKE HOME DELIVERED MEALS YOU LIKE MEALS ON WHEELS KNOCKERS WRITERS. I THINK. ADDITIONALLY RECEIVED TO APPROVE FOR YOU OLDER AT ALL RECOVERY RESILIENCE PACKAGE. WHICH YOU DO HAVE NOTED IN JEFF DIFFERENT INITIATIVES SOME OF THAT MARK SPOKE TO THE ONE THAT I JUST WANTED TO BRIEFLY TOUCH ON- OR THE ONE THAT I WANT TO BRIEFLY TOUCH ON- WAS THE CONTINUED. SUPPORT FOR. OUR BEHAVIOR HEALTH FRIENDSHIP LINES WE CONTINUE TO SUPPORT ABOUT- AND THOSE DOLLARS NOW WITH THE CONDITIONAL APPROVAL FROM- CMS. THE A OF THE H. CBS PLAN OUTSIDE A NOTE WILL BE ABLE TO AMEND THAT AGREE AND GET THOSE DOLLARS I'M CONTRACT CAN TO. THIS OF THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH FRIENDSHIP LINE- FOR ALL OLDER ADULTS ACROSS CALIFORNIA ADDITIONALLY ARE- DEPARTMENTS TEAM HAS MADE A LOT OF PROGRESS ON THE SENIOR NUTRITION INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT. IT WAS ALSO INCLUDED- WE'VE DONE A LOT OF COLLABORATION WITH OUR TRIPLE A PARTNERS AND THEY HAVE BEEN WORKING CLOSELY WITH MEALS ON WHEELS CALIFORNIA SINCE THAT WAS THAT THEN BACK- A DOCTOR AS A LEGISLATIVE INVESTMENT AND AGAIN THAT IS. FUNDED VIA THE EACH YEAR SPENDING PLAN SO NOW THAT WE HAVE GOT CONDITIONAL APPROVAL WE WILL BE WORKING TO LAUNCH THAT WITH THE PROPOSED LARGE STATE. OF JULY TWENTY TWENTY TWO- ATTY THE OTHER ONE THAT I WANTED NOTE ON WAS OUR SENIOR EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES- WHICH IS MODELING AND EXPANDING OUR TITLE FIVE. PROGRAM WE HAVE DONE A LOT OF THE BUILDING AND INITIAL WORK ON THAT EFFORT AND ALSO PLAN TO BE ABLE TO. EXECUTE AGREEMENTS AND EXPAND THOSE SERVICES- THIS SUMMER AS WELL I THINK WE'RE LOOKING AT- JULY. THE LAST IN THAT I WANTED TO NOTE IS DO YOU WANT IT TERMED YOU PROVIDE. FOR OUR CAP HEALTH INSURANCE CAL IN AB PROGRAM HELP WITH MINOR. WE HAVE KICKED OFF EFFORTS THERE ARE PROGRAMS STAFF HAS TAKEN THE LEAD AND THAT DONE THE ENGAGEMENT WITH STAKEHOLDERS- THEY WORKED WITH A CONSULTANT TO. DEVELOP A BLUEPRINT- AND THAT IS WELL UNDER WAY AND WE ARE WORKING TOWARDS NOW- TRYING TO IDENTIFY A PLANS LONG TERM. DEBT RUN THE GAMUT FOR MODERNIZATION I'M LOOKING AT THE FUNDING METHODOLOGY LOOKING ACT- STATUTE AND ENSURING BOX APPROPRIATE ALSO LOOKING AT THE WAY THE HIGH CAPS OPERATE- LIKE MARK TALKED ABOUT WITH YOUR SEATS ARE BRANDING. TO ENSURE THAT IT IS MORE APPROPRIATE AND MORE INFORMATIVE TO OLDER ADULTS AND LASTLY ALSO LOOKING TO IMPLEMENT STANDARDIZED TRAINING AND NEW TOOLS ACROSS. BOB GRAHAM. AND I THINK THOSE COVER KIND OF THE MAJOR ITEMS THAT OUR TEAM. HAS BEEN WORKING ON THAT- WERE PART OF THE YEAR'S. THANK YOU. IN THERE'S ONE FOR THAT I BE REMISS IF I DIDN'T MENTION BECAUSE SENATOR CAN WAS SLOW. IN SUPPORT OF ADVOCATE FOR WHICH IS OUR FALLS PREVENTION PROGRAM AND SO IN TWENTY NINETEEN WE RECEIVED A FIVE MILLION DOLLAR AUGMENTATION TO- EMPLOYMENT FALLS PREVENTION PROGRAMS THERE ARE TRIPLE A.'S- I'M HAPPY TO REPORT THAT IT'S BEEN. A VERY SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM- FOR INSTANCE WE CONDUCTED TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED EDUCATIONAL CLASSES ON FALLS PREVENTION- WE PURCHASED OVER THIRTY SEVEN THOUSAND PIECES OF EQUIPMENT. WE PERFORMED APPROXIMATELY FIFTEEN HUNDRED HOME ASSESSMENTS AND MADE ELEVEN HUNDRED HOME MODIFICATIONS. IN A SURVEY THAT WE CONDUCTED- APART DISPENSED MAJORITY PARTICIPANTS ARE VERY HAPPY WITH THE SERVICES THAT WE REQUEST THAT THEY RECEIVED- I WILL NOTE THAT. WE HAVE A PANDEMIC DEFINITELY SET THIS PROGRAM BACK- SOME PEOPLE ARE NOT COUPLE HAVING. ONE OF THEIR HOUSE- TO HOW MODIFICATIONS- IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE WE DEFINITELY SIGN UP TAKEN SERVICES- WE DIDN'T SPEND THE FULL AMOUNT OF THE AUGMENTATION. BUT WE DO BELIEVE THAT WORKING WITH OUR TRIPLE A.'S AN INCREASE PROMOTION OF THIS PROGRAM. THAT YOU KNOW MORE PEOPLE DEFINITELY SERVICES- AND IT DEFINITELY PROVIDES A VALUABLE SERVICE FALLS ARE ONE OF THE LEADING CAUSES OF DEATH AB OLDER ADULTS. SO THIS IS DEFINITELY CRITICAL PROGRAM THAT WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO EXPAND AND GROW. OKAY IT ANY ANY OTHER PROGRAMS THAT YOU YOU FACE BIG OBSTACLES OR CHALLENGES AND BEING ABLE TO. TO MAKE FORWARD PROGRESS ON. NOT NOW NO I CAN'T SAY THAT WE HAVE ALL SAY THAT OUR PARTNERS AND PROVIDERS HAVE JUST BEEN VERY. SUPPORTIVE AND COLLABORATIVE AND SUPPORTING OUR INITIATIVES LAUNCHING NEW PROGRAMS. SO I'M YOU KNOW I'M NOT. I CAN'T THINK OF ANY PROGRAMS WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT OBSTACLES OR CHALLENGES- TODAY. OKAY THANK YOU AND I WOULD I WOULD JUST ADD ONE OTHER INITIATIVE THERE SO MANY AND I APPRECIATE MARC AND THOMAS- THEIR COMMAND OF ALL THE INITIATIVES- ALZHEIMER'S DAY CARE RESOURCE CENTER INITIATIVE ALSO THAT WE'RE DOING IN PARTNERSHIP WITH COMMUNITY BASED ADULT. SERVICES THE SEA BASS CENTERS AND THEY'VE BEEN PHENOMENAL PARTNERS IN AND DEVELOPING THAT MODEL AND PULLING IN THE EXPERTISE AROUND THE STATE. FROM ADULT DAY HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS. OKAY THANK YOU. AND I'M GONNA TURN IT OVER T DR PAN FOR ANY QUESTIONS RIGHT NOW BUT FIRST I'D LIKE TO BE ABLE TO CALL THE ROLL OVER AN HOUR AND I THINK WE'RE ALL HERE SO.PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. EGGMAN HERE MELENDEZ. PAM YEAH. OKAY WE NOTICE IT I AM DOCTOR PAN ARE HERE OUR THIRTY PM. THANK YOU AND REALLY APPRECIATE THE- PRESENTATION AND- I MEAN THERE'S A LOT OF GOOD WORK HAPPENING PART OF AGING I GUESS THAT'S A STEP BACK A LITTLE BIT AND JUST THE QUESTION ABOUT- YOU KNOW GIVING THE AGING POPULATION AND THE DEMOGRAPHIC CHANGES WATER INVESTMENT NEEDS TO BE AND- ARE- OUR OUR OF. OUR POPULATION AGING POPULATION AND I KNOW WE HAD AN INFORMATIONAL HEARING ABOUT IT. SO AN APPRECIATE THESE INVESTMENTS I GUESS IS. AND I KNOW WE'RE PUTTING SOME YEAH MORE FUNDING TO IMPLEMENT THE MASTER PLAN AND THE DEPARTMENT- AS ONE QUESTIONS IS THAT- AS WE GO FORWARD TIME WEDNESDAY YEAH I THINK SO WE HAVE SEVERAL GOALS AND WE WANT. ALLOW SENIORS BILL STAYED HOME MORE LONGER RIGHT BECAUSE IT'S VERY EXPENSIVE IF THEY HAVE TO GO INTO INSTITUTIONS- IT'S A- IT'S NOT NECESSARILY ALWAYS THE BEST PLACE. IF WE CAN AVOID TO AND STILL HAVING AT HOME. ARE WE DOING ANY SORT OF I GUESS SO. BUT IT. SOUNDS LIKE WE'RE DOING. NOW WE NEED TO DO PROGRAM EVALUATIONS WITH THE VARIOUS PROGRAM AND S. S. P. AN OUTSIDER. BUT ARE WE- IS THERE SOME EFFORTS ARE THOUGHT ABOUT DOING A SORT OF MORE EPIDEMIOLOGICAL APPROACH OUR POPULATION BASED APPROACH AND SAY OKAY. NOW WE KNOW THE DEMOGRAPHIC CHANGES ARE HAPPENING IN OUR POPULATION. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT PERCENTAGE OF SENIORS. ARE HAVING TO BE INSTITUTIONALIZED ABLE STATE HOME DISPOSAL SO WE GET A SENSE OF OUR TRAJECTORY RIGHT SELF KIMA LEE WE YEAH WE HAVE THESE INDIVIDUAL PROGRAMS AND- I THINK THERE'S SOME EVIDENCE FOR MANY OF THEM- EVEN IN FRANCE ESSENTIAL EVIDENCE THAT THEY- HELP BUT CUMULATIVELY. WHERE WHERE ARE WE GOING ARE WE ABLE TO KEEP MORE SENIORS AT AND MORE SENIORS ABLE TO STAY AT HOME AS A PROPORTION OF THE SENIORS IN THE POPULATION ETCETERA. SO ASIDE FROM SPECIFIC PROGRAM EVALUATION THE DIFFERENT PROGRAMS THAT YOU'RE IMPLEMENTING- CAN YOU SPEAK TO WHETHER THERE'S AN AFTERTHOUGHT TO TRY TO DO SEVERAL POPULATION BASED APPROACH AS WELL SAYING CUMULATIVELY ALL THE PROGRAMS THAT WE'RE DOING IS. MAKING A CHANGE THAT TRAJECTORY ARE NOT. GOOD AFTERNOON DOCTOR PAN- I'LL TAKE THE FIRST INTENDED THAT- WE'RE VERY EXCITED ABOUT CAL AIM AND THAT'S JUST ONE ON ONE FACET OF CARE AND SERVICES AND SUPPORTS FOR OLDER ADULTS THAT- SOME OF THAT WITH THE CMS WAIVER APPROVALS FOR CARRYING IN THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES AND SOME OF THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT ARE ON THE HORIZON WITH THE MEDICARE POPULATION- USING A POPULATION HEALTH- LANDS. AS SOMETHING THAT WE'RE WE'RE DEFINITELY LOOKING FORWARD TO AND HOW WE CAN. LINK OUR AREA AGENCIES ON AGING CLOSELY WITH HEALTH PLANS- TO THAT END- WE ALSO HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND THERE IS A PROPOSAL IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET AT LEAST- AS FAR AS ALZHEIMER'S WITH THE HEALTHY BRAIN INITIATIVE THAT'S LOOKING AT MORE. ABOUT POPULATION HEALTH SEE THE CENSUS RESULTS IN THE TWENTY TWENTY CENSUS THE TWO. BIG TAKEAWAYS FOR THE NATION WHERE THAT THE AGING OF THE POPULATION AND THE DIVERSIFICATION OF THE POPULATION. AND THOSE BOTH INTERSECT WITH. WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF AGING AND WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING FINAL CENSUS. DATA FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND HOW WE CAN APPLY THAT PROBABLY WORKING WITH THE ADMINISTRATION. ON COMMUNITY LIVING. AND FUTURE OLDER AMERICANS ACT FUNDING FORMULAS AND HOW WE CAN BE SURE THAT PEOPLE WITH THE GREATEST ECONOMIC OR SOCIAL NEEDS. ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AND FEDERAL FUNDING FORMULAS AND MARK AND THOMAS IF YOU'D LIKE TO ADD TO THAT. YEAH I THINK WHAT I AM WOULD ADD IS WE WILL BE COLLABORATING WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF. HEALTH CARE SERVICES ON THEIR H. C. B. S. ROAD MAP- SO. YOU KNOW CAN'T REALLY SPEAK TO THE SKIP OF THAT PROJECT BUT I WOULD IMAGINE THAT THAT PROJECT WOULD INCLUDE AN ANALYSIS OF DIFFERENT POPULATIONS WHO MIGHT BE- YOU KNOW SUITED FOR CERTAIN TYPES OF WAIVER PROGRAMS WHERE WAIVER PROGRAMS MAY NEED TO EXPAND- MAYBE. IN CERTAIN AREAS ARE OVERSUBSCRIBED BUT I YOU KNOW I THINK THAT- PROGRAM MIGHT- THAT PROJECT ALSO MIGHT HELP. TO KIND OF IDENTIFY WITH THE NEEDS OF CALIFORNIANS AGING. YOU KNOW POPULATION IS AND WHAT PROGRAMS MIGHT BEST SUIT THEIR NEEDS. OKAY NOPE IF PRECIADO THAT THAT SO IT'S I GUESS I GUESS I WOULD JUST URGE THAT- IN ADDITION TO SPECIFIC PROGRAM EVALUATIONS AND WE HAVE A LOT OF DIFFERENT PROGRAMS HERE. THAT WE ALSO BE SURE THAT THERE ARE SOME EFFORT AT. LOOKING AT THE TRAJECTORY OF THE OVERALL SENIOR POPULATION WE KNOW IT'S GROWING- AND- YOU KNOW MAYBE CAN PULL FROM CENSUS DATA A COUPLE FROM OTHER SOURCES AND PERHAPS DTS AT CETERA. BUT- IT'S- YEAH I WOULD JUST SAY IS THAT- YOU KNOW CERTAINLY DESERVE A POPULATION THAT HAS- MANY NEEDS- THAT- AND THAT- OU KNOW WE WILL BE SURE THAT- WE- WERE HERE IN THE BUDGET COMMITTEE WE HAVE THANK YOU KNOW THE PROJECT OUT TO THE FUTURE THAT WERE ABLE TO. TO MEET THOSE NEEDS AND I JUST WANT. OF ONE OF THE THINGS THAT CAME OUT THE INFORMATIONAL HEARING WAS IS THAT- IF WE WERE JUST GOING TO KEEP THE SAME LEVEL SERVICE. EIGHT AS WE'RE DOING NOW AND- HOPEFULLY WE'RE LOOKING AT DOING BETTER AND OTHER THINGS. THAT WE WOULD HAVE TO. JUST ON DEMOGRAPHIC CHANGE ALONE. WE WOULD NEED TO INCREASE OUR INVESTMENT IN SERVICES FOR SENIORS BY ABOUT 5% PER YEAR WHICH IS ACTUALLY LARGER FASTER THAN OUR- OVERALL GDP GROWTH AND- OTHER TYPE THING SO- PRESIDENTIAL EVEN OUR TAX BASE SO. IT'S SO. BE AWARE LESSONS IS THERE IS THAT OKAY WELL I DO WAY SO WE CAN DO THINGS BETTER AND SMARTER AS WELL WELL NOT OF COURSE REDUCING THE LEVEL SERVICE PROVIDING AND SO. JUST KNOWING WHERE WE ARE AND THAT'S YOUR DIRECTORY. IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S GONNA BE IMPORTANT- IN ADDITION TO OF COURSE KNOWING HOW OUR VARIOUS PROGRAMS ARE WORKING AS WELL SO I'M JUST HOPING THAT- WE'RE ABLE TO TAKE THOSE. GET SOME SNAPSHOTS OF HOW WE'RE DING ON AN ONGOING BASIS SO WE CAN TRACK OUR TRAJECTORY. AND AND BE SURE THAT WE'RE MAKING YARD AND INVEST YOU KNOW TARGET INVESTMENTS. IN THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY POSSIBLE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR DEPEND. ON- WE CAN ALL BE. THAT ARE ARE. HERE'S BUSY TAKING NOTES AND- WILL BE SURE TO FOLLOW UP ON ALL THE ITEMS.

ACTUAR ACTING DEPUTY DIRECTOR LEORA PHYLLIS YOU KNOW TO SPEAK TO YOUR QUESTIONS RELATED TO I JUST LAST ON. THE AGENDA THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MISTER WILSON. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- MY NAME IS LI OR CLOSE ENOUGH I AM THE ACTING DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE ADULT PROGRAMS DIVISION AT THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES. I'M SORRY JUST AS PROGRAM IS OF REALLY THERE IS A PROGRAM TO PROVIDE SERVICES PERSONAL CARE SERVICES AND DOMESTIC SERVICES TO NEARLY SIX HUNDRED SIXTY THOUSAND LOW INCOME AGE BLIND AND DISABLED INDIVIDUALS. THE GOAL OF THE PROGRAM IS TO KEEP HEM SAFELY IN THEIR OWN HOME AND AVOID INSTITUTIONALIZATION THEY ARE SERVED BY APPROXIMATELY FIVE HUNDRED SIXTY THOUSAND I JUST AS PROVIDERS OF WHICH 55% OF THEM LIVE WITH EVERY STEP YET AND APPROXIMATELY 74% OF THEM ARE FAMILY. MEMBERS AND RELATED TO THAT PERSON. THEY WORK FOR I'M HAPPY PROVIDE OVERVIEW OF THE- I TWENTY THREE I JUST AS BUDGET INCLUDES POINT NINE BILLION. DOLLARS OF WHICH FOUR POINT NINE BILLION OR GENERAL FUND SH IN TWENTY ONE AND TWENTY TWO AND EIGHTEEN POINT FIVE BILLION OF WHICH SIX POINT FIVE BILLION. IT'S GENERAL FUND IN THE MID TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE YEAR. TWENTY THERE IS A DECREASE IN THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO BUDGET OF THREE HUNDRED EIGHT POINT FOUR MILLION AND A DECREASE OF SIX HUNDRED SEVENTY ONE POINT FOUR MILLIONGENERAL FUND DUE TO LOWER CASELOAD- WHICH IS SLIGHTLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN THE COST PER HOUR AND HOURS PER CASE IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THE GENERAL FUND HAS DECREASED SIGNIFICANTLY- DUE TO THE EXTENSION OF THE KOBE AND- TEMPORARY SIX POINT 2% NOW INCREASE. ADDITIONALLY THERE'S INCREASE IN THE TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE BUDGET OF ONE POINT THREE BILLION. OF THAT NINE HUNDRED AND FORTY SEVEN POINT SEVEN MILLION AS GENERAL FUND. DUE TO CONTINUED CASELOAD GROWTH COSTS FOR HOURS AND HOURS PER CASE. FOR ITS IMPORTANCE NOTE THAT FOR- THE TWENTY ONE ONE TWENTY TWO YEAR- I AM JUST AS COSTS INCLUDE HALF OF THE YEAR IN THE HOUSE YOUR IMPACT OF THE INCREASE OF MINIMUM WAGE TO FIFTEEN DOLLARS PER HOUR. WELL THE TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE BUT- BUDGET. INCLUDES THE ENTIRE YEAR- OF THAT THE FULL YEAR OF THAT FIFTEEN DOLLAR MINIMUM WAGE THE BUDGET BUT IT'S IMPORTANT RIGHT NOW ONE OF WHICH IS THE PERMANENT BACK UP- PROVIDER SYSTEM THIS INVESTMENT. OF TWENTY FOUR POINTEIGHT MILLION DOLLARS IS- MEANT TO SET UP A BACKUP PROVIDER SYSTEM ACROSS THE STATE- A PER MONTH MAKE IT PERMANENT ACTUALLY THIS SYSTEM CREATES A PERMANENT SOLUTION THAT ALLOWS- COUNTIES TO- HELP. I JUST AS RECIPIENTS FROM THE BACK OF PROVIDERS- ADDITIONALLY IT- WE HAVE ALSO INCLUDED THERE'S ALSO AN INCLUSION OF NINE AND NINETEEN POINT ONE MILLION. DOLLAR INVESTMENT FOR THE CONTINUOUS COVERAGE REQUIREMENT. I'M WHICH COST MEDIC HOW- TERMINATIONS ARE RE DETERMINATIONS IN RESPONSE TO THE PUBLIC NINETEEN PANDEMIC AND PREVENTS CASES FROM SHIFTING FROM- FROM UP. SORRY FROM SHIFTING FROM THE NON FEDERAL INTO A NON FEDERALLY FUNDED PROGRAM WHICH IS THE CENTRAL. ADDITIONALLY THE BUDGET INCLUDES- A PENALTY REDUCTION FOR THE LET RECIPROCATION IMPLEMENTATION- IT COVERS THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF PENALTIES AND- TWICE IN TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE. AND- CHAU AND THEN LOOKING AT THE AGENDA IT LOOKS LIKE YOU THEY DID A WONDERFUL JOB OF OUTLINING ALL OF THE INVESTMENTS WERE THERE ANY QUESTIONS WITH REGARDS TO THIS. WELL WE'RE GONNA TURN IT OVER TO THE L. A. O. IN A MINUTE BUT I GUESS ONE OF THE ONE OF THE THINGS IF YOU COULD JUST SPEAK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT. IS TO WHAT YOU CONTRIBUTE THE- THE DECLINE IN IN CASES. SURE SO THAT WAS- THE SECOND QUESTION I BELIEVE THAT THERE WAS- ISSUE RAISED WITH REGARD OR CONCERN WITH REGARDS TO THERE'S A SLOWER SLOWER GROWTH IN THE PEACHTREE'S TRIBUTE- AS IT WAS KIND OF ALLUDED TO BUYER- OUR COLLEAGUES AT THE DEPARTMENT OF AGING THAT THEY'RE DUE TO THE COVERT NINETEEN PANDEMIC THERE WERE LOTS OF- INDIVIDUAL RECIPIENTS WHO DIDNOT WANT TO HAVE STRANGERS IN THEIR HOMES SO- WE THINK. BASED ON. ANECDOTAL DATA THINGS THAT WE'VE HEARD AND STATE MEETINGS WE BELIEVE THIS AND- ONE OF THE MANY REASONS WHY PAID CASE. BUT WE DO TO LOOK AT THE PRO DATA TO A- TRÊN- AT TO SEE IF CAN FIGURE OUT IF THERE'S ANY OTHER- THINGS HAPPEN OUT THERE THAT. THAT- IMPACTS THE NUMBER OF CASES HAVE THE AMOUNT OF FAMILY CAREGIVERS GONE UP. AND WHEN WE SAY PETER TALKING OUTSIDE. PEOPLE WHO WOULD COME FROM- AN AGENCY. SO ALL OF OUR PROVIDERS ARE FOR THE MOST PART THE MAJORITY OF THEM ARE ARE- INDIVIDUAL PROVIDERS STERN WE HAVE A VERY SMALL NUMBER OF CASES ACTUALLY HAVE. AN AGENCY- EMPLOYEE COME TO THEIR HOME LESS THAN A HUNDRED CASES SO MOST OF OUR PROVIDERS ARE- ARE JUST PEOPLE OUT THERE IN THE COMMUNITY. 74% AND THAT SEEMS TO BE STAYING PRETTY RELATIVELY FLAT THAT NUMBER 74% OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS HAVE A PROVIDER WHO- WHO IS RELATED TO THEM NOT- SO THE- AND IN SOME CASES. THERE COULD BE MULTIPLE PROVIDERS ON THE CASE SO SHORT SO. AND WE HAVE SEEN OVER THAT- OVER THE YEARS THAT WE DO SEE AN INCREASE WITH OF PROVIDERS WHO ARE RELATIVE PROVIDERS BUT IT'S NOT AS- IT'S NOT AS PREVALENT. AS AS ACROSS THE POPULATION. THAT MAKES SENSE BUT WE'VE HAD THAT SAID WHAT I'M READING AS WE HAVE HAD THE SAME AMOUNT OF REFERRALS AND DECLINES BUT BUT THE NUMBERS GOING DOWN ABOUT HOW MANY PEOPLE WERE BRINGING INTO THE PROGRAM. I'VE BEEN ANY ANYTHING THAT'S JUST THE PEOPLE DON'T WANT SOMEBODY ELSE IN THEIR HOME BUT AT THIS POINT THAT'S JUST ANECDOTAL IS THAT CORRECT. THAT'S CORRECT SO WHAT WE ARE SEEING IS THAT THAT YOU'RE RIGHT THE NUMBER OF CASES COMING AND HAS HAS CONTINUED TO INCREASE. BUT THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE OF CASES WHO ARE PAID MEANING THAT A PROVIDER HAS HOME IS CONNECTED TO THAT RECIPIENT IN TIME SHEET ACTIVITY- AND THERE'S TRANSIT ACTIVITY WE'RE SEEING THAT. THAT NUMBER. OF CASES HAS ACTUALLY INCREASED OVER THAT PANDEMIC SO IT'S NOT THE OVERALL SHE SLOWED IS THE FOLKS THAT. HAVE A PROVIDER- WHEN WE LOOK AT THAT AT THE DATA IT SEEMS AS THOUGH. JUST THIS IS A- DURING CULTURE NINETEENTH SO PRIOR TO COPE IT NEEDED WE DID NOT SEE THAT. AS A WERE TRADING THAT. TO TWO RECIPIENTSREALLY BE CARE IN CAR ABOUT THEY HAVE. AND NOT BRINGING NEW PEOPLE IT SO YOU HAVE A FLAT RATE. OF YOU HAVE A NUMBER OF GROUP OF RECIPIENTS WHO WHO DO HAVE A RELATIVE PROVIDER BUT YOU DO HAVE A ANOTHER SUBSET OF RECIPIENTS WHO DO NOT HAVE A ROLE TO PROVIDER. AND SOME OF THOSE PEOPLE AS THEY COME INTO THE PROGRAM MAY NOT HAVE. A FAMILY MEMBER OR SOMEBODY WHO LIVES WITH THEM THAT CAN PROVIDE THEIR CARE AND THOSE INDIVIDUALS MAY DURING THIS TIME NOT WANT TO HAVE A STRANGER COME INTO THEIR HOME AND PROVIDE THAT'S- BUT- THE CURRENTLY THEN WE DON'T WE DON'T KNOW THE STATUS OF THOSE PEOPLE. IF THEY'RE JUST OUT THERE THE MORNING CARE WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO HAVE ANY IN. WE JUST KNOW THEY WERE PICKED UP ON AND OUR CASELOADS. SO WE KNOW THAT THEY'RE NOT PAID BUT WE DO HAVE MECHANISMS THAT- THAT. COUNTIES CAN USE TO IDENTIFY WE HAVE REPORTING BACK TO COUNTIES USED TO IDENTIFY PEOPLE WHO DO NOT HAVE A PAYROLL ACTIVELY FOR CERTAIN AMOUNT OF TIME. AND THAT'S NOT JUST FOR NEW BUT THAT'S FOR EXISTING PEOPLE SO THE COUNTIES DO OUTREACH TO THOSE INDIVIDUALS TO SEE IF THEY CAN HELP THEM. WITH A SIGNING UP PROVIDER OR IF YOU NEED SOME TYPE OF THIS STEP SO WEAK THERE ARE MECHANISMS WITHIN THE PROGRAM. FOR COUNTIES TO DO THAT OUTREACH. OKAY THANK YOU. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. YEAH I KNOW I'M CONFIRMING OF FINANCE NOTHING FURTHER TO ADEQUATELY ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU VERY MUCH LMAO. IT'S JACQUI YOU KNOW AND WE RECENTLY OUR INITIAL ANALYSIS OF THE HSS PROJECT INCLUDED IN THAT ANALYSIS- WAS KEY OBSERVATIONS AROUND CASELOAD AND AS WAS NOTED IN THE AGENDA- WE DIDN'T WE ARE SEEING THAT- AS AUTHORIZED CASES AND PAID CASES ARE INCREASING. THERE IS STILL. A GREATER DIFFERENCE BETEEN THOSE TWO NUMBERS OPERATES CASES AND THEN AMONG THE- PAID CASES SO PAID CASES HAVE JUST BEEN INCREASING AT A SLOWER RATE RELATIVE TO PRE COMBAT NINETEEN LEVELS- WE'RE WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT TO GET ADDITIONAL INFORMATION TO SEE- TRY TO ISOLATE LIKE WHERE IS IT HAPPENING- BECAUSE AS- THE CHAIR MENTIONED. WE'RE STILL SEEING THE SAME NUMBER RECIPIENTS COMING IN EVERY MONTH THE NEWLY AUTHORIZED CASES COMING IN EVERY MONTH THE RECEIPTS SEEING THE SAME NUMBER OF DENIALS EVERY MONTH- RELATIVE TO PRE COALPIT NINETEEN LEVELS AMID AND IN ADDITION WE'RE HOPEFULLY WITH THE DATA AND WE CAN GET A BETTER SENSE OF IF THERE ARE CERTAIN RECIPIENT TYPES ARE CASE TYPES. WHERE THIS PARTICULAR TEN JUST CONCENTRATED SUCH AS LIBYAN VERSUS NON LIVE IN PROVIDERS I MEAN MAYBE THAT WILL GIVE US A BETTER SENSE STEP TO WHAT EXTENT IS THIS SAD TREND DUE TO PERSONAL CHOICE- VERSES. UNMET NEED INDIVIDUALS PERHAPS I'M HAVING A HARDER TIME TO FIND A PROVIDER AT THIS TIME. ANOTHER KEY OBSERVATION- THAT WE MADE IN OUR ANALYSIS THAT WAS ALSO REFERENCED IN THE- IT AND THE AGENDA- WAS THE THAT CONTINUED COVERAGE AS A RESULT OF THE TEMPORARY POSITS MEDIC HOW UPSET REASSESSMENTS WE JUST NOTE THAT- THAT TEMPORARY PAUSE- UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET IS ASSUMED TO GO AWAY. AT THE END OF JUNE OF THIS YEAR TWENTY TWENTY TWO- SO ONCE THAT GOES AWAY MEDICAL REASSESSMENTS WILL CONTINUE AGAIN- AND AS WE KNOW- PRIOR. TO THE TEMPORARY PAUSE THERE IS A DIFFERENT TO TERMS THAT RISK. THAT WERE NOT I JUST THAT WERE NOT COULD ABOUT TERM. SOME OF THEM TERM FROM THE I JUST PROGRAM WELL- VERSUS SOME OF THEM BEING. TERMINATED FROM THE JUST AS PROGRAM I'M SO THE LEGISLATURE COULD ALSO CONSIDER- AS A PART OF THIS BUDGET PROCESS IF IT WOULD LIKE TO TRY TO ADDRESS- THE POSSIBLE. THE POSSIBILITY OF DIFFERENT TREATMENTS. LASTLY AND OUR ANALYSIS WE MENTIONED- WE PROVIDED A STATUS UPDATE ON THE VARIOUS COLBY NINETEEN BUCKS ABILITIES ADOPTED IN THE I JUST AS PROGRAM. ONE OF THEM BEING THERE I MERGING SEA BACKUP WRITER SYSTEM THAT EXPIRED DECEMBER TWENTY TWENTY ONE. INITIALLY AS A PART OF LAST YEAR'S BUDGET THE INTENT WISE- ONES THAT EMERGENCY TEMPORARY BACKUP WRITER SYSTEM EXPIRED IT WOULD GET PICKED UP AGAIN THROUGH THE PERMANENT PROVIDER SYSTEM. BUT DUE TO A DELAY IN ADOPTING THE PROGRAM MODEL- FOR THE PERMANENT BACKUP WRITER SYSTEM IN THE IN STATUTE- D. AS- IN THE IMPLEMENTATION DATE FOR THE PERMANENT SYSTEM HAS BEEN DELAYED UNTIL JULY. SO THERE IS CURRENTLY A GAP IN BACKUP WRITER SYSTEMS IN OUR AND OUR ANALYSIS WE JUST PROVIDED- JUST. POSSIBLE CONSIDERATIONS THE LEGISLATURE COULD TAKE IF IT WANTED TO ADDRESS THAT. SHORT TERM GAP- WHILE WE WAIT TEST SET UP THAT A PROGRAM MODEL IN STATUTE- AND THAT COULD INCLUDE. YEAH I'M LOOKING AT WHETHER PRIOR FUNDS FOR THE EMERGENCY BACKUP PROVIDER IF THERE ANY UNSPENT FUNDS THAT COULD POSSIBLY BE EXTENT- THEIR EXPENDITURE THIRTY COULD POSSIBLY BE EXTENDED UNTIL JULY. I'M SO WE JUST HAVE THAT TEMPORARY STOPGAP- AND THAT'S THE END OF MY COMMENTS HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. DURATION YOU WANT TO SPEAK TO THAT ONE POINT ANY AND IT IS OUR FUNDING CAN. WELL DETAILS BEING WORKED OUT WITH THE OTHER. YES ACTUALLY WE HAVE BEEN EXPLORING THAT STAND AND BELIEVE THAT WE ARE LIKELY TO HAVE A RESOLUTION TO THE SAME LEAD COMPLETELY RECOGNIZED THAT A GAP CREATES MANY CHALLENGES WE ABSOLUTELY ARE COMMITTED TO WORKING ON A- PERMANENT SYSTEM. THAT CAN- ABBY IMPLEMENTED AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE WITH ALL THE GREAT ENGAGEMENT OF THOSE TO DEVELOP THE RIGHT SYSTEM. SO AB WE ARE HOPING TO VERY SHORTLY ANNOUNCE ADD THAT WE ARE. ABLE TO BRIDGE THIS GAP IN AND MOVE FORWARD SO AT.

THANK YOU DIRECTORS- SO. AS SOME OF THE QUESTIONS PLEASE PROVIDE AN UPDATE ON THE ROLE OF THAT JUST AS YOUR PATHWAYS. WE ACTUALLY DONE QUITE A FEW ACTIVE. WE MEDICAL STAKEHOLDERS LAST JULY AND SEPTEMBER TO DEFINE THE CAREER PATHWAYS PROGRAM DIRECTIVES. WE ALSO HELD A PUBLIC LISTENING SESSIONS IN DECEMBER TWENTY TWENTY ONE IN JANUARY OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO. UP FOR FEEDBACK FROM I JUST AS RECIPIENTS OF PROVIDERS REGARDS TO. OUT WITH REGARDS TO HOW WE'RE GOING TO IMPLEMENT THE PROGRAM WE ASKED FOR CONCERNS- THEIR THOUGHTS. THEY WERE VERY WELL ATTENDED- WE'RE PLANNING ON. ANOTHER LISTENING SESSION IN LATE FEBRUARY OR EARLY MARCH- THIS. FISH WERE ACTUALLY FOCUS ON LANGUAGE ACCESS ONE OF THE CONCERNS THAT- ARE. RECIPIENTS OF PROVIDERS PRODUCT WHAT WAS LANGUAGE ACCESS AND EVEN LANGUAGE ACCESS. TO THE LISTENING SESSIONS SO WE WANT TO DEFINITELY TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SCHEDULE ANOTHER LISTENING SESSION AND INCLUDE THOSE PEOPLE IN OUR POPULATIONS THAT MAY NOT HAVE PARTICIPATED BEFORE BECAUSE OF LANGUAGE ACCESS. AND SO THAT'S- REALLY WHAT WE'RE GOING TO BE DOING AND THE- FEBRUARY MARCH TIME- AS FAR AS- WE ARE PURSUING CONTRACTS- A COUPLE OF I. ONE INSTANCE SIR. WITH TO- THE ACTUAL PATHWAYS THEMSELVES IN THE CAREER GLADYS'S- WE WANT TO BRING SOMEBODY WHO HAD A LOT OF EXPERIENCE IN THIS SPACE- SO THAT THEY CAN HELP US BUILD. OUT THOSE AREAS OF THE PROGRAM AN ADDITIONAL THEY WERE ALSO- PURSUING- VENDOR ASSISTANCE WITH CAREER COACHING- FOR PROGRAM PARTICIPANTS- THERE ALSO CAN HELP US WITH MARKETING AND OUTREACH AND- HELP US WITH DATA AND SETTING UP SOME OF THOSE THINGS WE NEED TO PAY- INDIVIDUAL PROVIDERS FOR ATTENDING. THE TRAINING- WE'RE ALSO PLANNING ON PUBLISHING A. R. T. AND THE PROBABLY MARCH APRIL TIMELINE FOR THIS TO COME. SO THAT'S PART OF THE STATUTORY FIREMEN FOR COMPETITIVE BID- WE'RE LOOKING FOR TRAINING VENDORS- WE- AND IT WORKS ALL OF THE AGREE TO BE EXTRA PRIOR TO THE IMPLEMENTATION DATE OF THE SEPTEMBER OCTOBER TIME SH SO- THAT'S PRETTY MUCH WHERE WE ARE WITHOUT WE'RE ALSO PLANNING THERE IS A PROVISION IN THE STATUTE FOUR EIGHT EVALUATION PERIOD IN A REPORT SO WE'RE LOOKING AT- CONTRACTING FOR THAT PIECE AS WELL BECAUSE WE DEFINITELY WANT. TO GET A HOLD OF HOW WELL THIS- PROGRAM IS AND HOW EFFECTIVE IT IS AND ALSO WE'RE IN THE PROCESS OF WORKING ON THE SYSTEM AUTOMATION SO- WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE ABLE TO EIGHT PEOPLE- THAT THEY CAN CLAIM THEIR TIME AND THAT. THEY ARE ABLE TO NOT ONLY GET THEIR TIME PAID FOR THE TIME THE INTENSE RAINY BUT ALSO THE INCENTIVE SO THAT'S PRETTY MUCH WHERE WE ARE AS FAR AS THE ROLLOUT. FOR CAREER. I THINK I THINK WE ARE YOU CAN JUST GOING TO THE OTHER SIR A LITTLE BIT. ABOUT WHAT THEY ARE AND IN GOOD FOR EVERY GREAT THANK YOU SURE- SO THE SECOND QUESTIONS RELATED TO THE PASSWORD TOPIC AREAS AND- THERE ARE FIVE. ARE YOU JUST AS CAREER PATHWAYS. TO THE GENERAL AREA WHICH IS GENERAL HEALTH AND SAFETY AND ADULT EDUCATION. AND THEN THREE SPECIALIZED AREAS WHICH INCLUDE COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENTS IN BEHAVIOR HEALTH. COMPLEX PHYSICAL NEEDS. AND TRANSITIONING FROM HOMELESSNESS RESULT OF STAKEHOLDER. HELD IN- JULY AND SEPTEMBER WITH THE PUBLIC WITH A WITH THE CALIFORNIA. PUBLIC AUTHORITIES B- COUNTY WELFARE DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION- THE LABOR ORGANIZATIONS- S. C. A. AND UW EXTENDED THE SESSIONS AS WELL AS RECIPIENTS OF PROVIDERS AND LEGAL ADVOCATES- BOB FIVE CAREER PATHWAYS- KIND OF. ARE SEPARATED TO WHERE YOU HAVE THREE THAT ARE RELATED TO I IT JUST LAST. IN QUALITY OF CARE AND THEN YOU HAVE THE TO GENERAL- PTHWAYS. THAT ARE ALL RELATED TO SETTING FOUNDATIONS AND GETTING GENERAL- TRAINING IN AREAS LIKE AND HEALTH AND SAFETY AND EDUCATION- THE ANTICIPATED. THAT WE- WERE HOPING FOR OR RECEIPT WE- WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE AND WE'RE AND WE'RE- POSITIVE WE WILL SEE- INCREASE QUALITY OF CARE PROVIDERS WHO WILL HAVE BUILT UPON THEIR KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS HOUSE SOMETHING SIMPLY HEARD IN. THE- IN THE LISTINGS FROM PROVIDER ARE THERE P. OUT WHO DO NOT FEEL- WITH PROVIDE CERTAIN SERVICES TO THEIR RECIPIENTS OF THEIR VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THINGS- AND SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE ADDRESSING THOSE TUNES. BURNS THROUGH THIS TRAINING- WE ALSO WANT TO. WE ENCOURAGE MEANINGFUL COMMUNICATION BETWEEN I JUST AS RECIPIENTS OF THEIR PROVIDERS AND PROVIDE SOME OF THOSE SKILLS- FOR HELP WITH THAT. RELATIONSHIP AND IMPROVE CARE OUTCOMES- WE ARE IN THE- IN THE PROCESS OF- OF CONTINUING TO WORK WITH OUR STAKEHOLDERS ON THIS WE'RE REALLY EXCITED ABOUT THIS PROPOSAL. AND THE GOAL IS REALLY TO IMPLEMENT A- EIGHT PROGRAMS THAT IS USED BY MANY AND IS REALLY REALLY. HOW EFFECTIVE AT PROVIDING THE SKILLS AND ENCOURAGING. PEOPLE TO TAKE THOSE NEXT STEPS IF THEY WANT TO FURTHER THEIR CAREER IN THE HEALTHCARE FIELD OR IF THEY JUST WANT TO. BILL BETTER ABOUT PROVIDING SERVICES TO THEIR- IT'S A STEP. OUR SO WERE THERE ANY QUESTIONS WITH REGARDS TO THAT. IT TO YOU WE'VE CONTRACTED WITH THE VENDOR ALREADY THAT THAT THAT HAS IDENTIFIED DID YOU SAID WE'RE WORKING WITH A WITH A PROGRAM THAT. THE THAT EVERYONE REALLY LOOKS. YES I APOLOGIZE. SO WE ARE WORKING ON- A CONTRACT WITH THE CONSULTANTS TO HELP US BUILD THE ACTUAL. SO THERE'S- MULTIPLE THINGS REFUSE THAT THERE IS WE WERE DOING EIGHT EIGHT R. P. TO BRING ON TRAINING VENDORS AND THEN WE HAVE A CONSULTANT THAT'S ACTUALLY GOING TO HELP US SET UP THE- STRUCTURE OF THE PROGRAM WHERE WE PROVIDE THE INFORMATION THAT IS NEEDED FOR. PROVIDERS TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY NEED TO DO TO GET TO THAT OTHER CAREER- THE OTHER THE OTHER HEALTH CARE CAREERS SO THAT'S THE GOAL IS TO PROVIDE INFORMATION TO PEOPLE THAT USE THEM SO THESE ARE THE TRAINING CLASSES THAT YOU CAN TAKE IN THESE ARE SETTING THE FOUNDATIONS FOR IT THIS IF YOUR GOAL IS TO. MAKE THE NCAA OR OR SOME TYPE OF NURSE THEN WE- BEST CONSULTANTS GOING TO HELP US DO. THAT THE TRAINING PIECES DONE THROUGH THE CAMPAIGN. PROCESS SO HOPE IS TO BRING BY. ON WHO ALREADY A STEP CORRECT. SO THE GOAL IS NOT TO. CORRECT BUT TO BRING. ON WHO MISSED CURRICULUM IN THESE AREAS. LOOK AT THAT AND THE QUESTION ON THE DID AND SO AND THEN THAT THIS QUESTION NUMBER THREE THIS IS HOW CAN BE TO THESE P. THE CELLS LIKE YOUR CAPACIT'E WAYS PEOPLE FEEL BETTER ABOUT THEIR WORK. AND THAT WILL BE A WAY TO RETAIN THEM I MIGHT BE JUMPING TO CONCLUSIONS. YOU KNOW THAT THAT IS VERY VERY CLOSE YES WE DO BELIEVE BASED ON THE FEEDBACK AND THE EXCITEMENT FROM THE I'D JUST AS PROVIDER COMMUNITY WHEN WE WENT OUT AND GET THESE LISTENING SESSIONS PEOPLE ARE REALLY EXCITED ABOUT THESE TRAINING. AND I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT IS A VERY DIFFICULT AS AN AGENT SUCH PROVIDERS WHEN YOU'RE HELPING SOMEBODY. THAT'S REALLY. REALLY SEVERELY IMPAIR. AND NEEDS A LOT OF US BUT I DO PEOPLE. ARE SCARE- WHEN THEY- THOSE IN THE- APPEAR. WHETHER THEIR FAMILY MEMBER. FAMILY MEMBERS. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HELPING THEM IN THOSE AREAS HOW DO WE YOUR FOR PERSONAL CARE SERVICES HOW DO WE PERFORM THESE SERVICES IN THE STATE. AND SO WHAT WE'RE HOPING IS BY PROVIDING SOME OF THAT TRAINING WE RETAIN PEOPLE BECAUSE WE'RE KIND OF A LIMITING SOME OF THE FAIR YEARS SEVERAL DIFFICULTIES THAT PEOPLE HAVE. AS BEING A PROVIDER AND THEN WE ALSO WANT TO RECRUIT PEOPLE BY SAYING HEY WE HAVE A WONDERFUL TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES FOR YOU TO COME IF YOU COME TO BE AND I JUST AS PROVIDER IN THIS PROGRAM WE'RE GOING TO PROVIDE THESE. THIS TRAINING SPEECH TRAINING SERVICES TO YOU SO YOU CAN ACTUALLY BETTER YOURSELF AND IF YOU WANT TO. PURSUE A CAREER IN HEALTH AND HEALTH CARE FIELD YOU CAN DO THAT AND WE'RE GOING TO PROVIDE YOU THE INFORMATION ON HOW TO. I WILL. IF I IF I MIGHT SHOW ADD A CUP THINGS ONE I WOULD JUST SAY- IS SPECIALLY- LISTENING SESSIONS ONE OF THE THINGS WE HEARD NUMEROUS TIMES FROM. THE WORK FORCE WAS AT PARTICULARLY THOSE WHO ARE CARING FOR. A POTENTIALLY LEVEL ON A RELATIVE OR SOMEONE ELSE WITH DEMENTIA FOR EXAMPLE AND JUST REALLY WANTED TO. MORE TOOLS AND RESOURCESTO BE ABLE TO BETTER SERVE- THAT INDIVIDUAL AND SO THAT'S A THAT'S AN EGG AT MORE CONCRETE EXAMPLE. I ALSO JUST WANT TO MENTION THAT THIS IS ANOTHER PLACE ON THE SILO BUSTING FRAME. WHERE WE ALSO ALSO HAVE A PARTNERSHIP HERE AND OBVIOUSLY THERE'S A NUMBER OF OTHER AT INVESTMENTS PROPOSED A RELATED TO THE WORK FORCE AND ACTUALLY HEALTHCARE CAREERS AS WELL SOCIAL WORK EXTRATERRESTRIAL TALK TO YOU ABOUT THE FUTURE HEARING- ABOUT WITH OUR- SISTER DEPARTMENT HEALTH CARE.

BUT WHERE WE ARE CREATING THAT NEW PATHWAY. AT TO GET TO THAT- THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THIS IS INTENDED TO DO SO JUST ALSO WANTED TO NOTE THAT KIND OF PARTNERSHIPS THAT WE'RE WORKING ON- AND ALSO USING WITHIN THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICE. AGENCY JOINT CONVERSATIONS WITH OUR PARTNERS AND COLLEAGUES IN HIGHER EDUCATION ADULT. AVERAGE WHAT'S OUT THERE AND HOW W CAN USE THAT AT TO FURTHER THIS PARTICULAR. SECTOR SILO BUSTING AT ITS FINEST JERRY SPIN OFF FOR THE SEQUEL HAS BEEN TASTIC. LA- ANYTHING.

HIGHER PAY OR OTHER THINGS FOR HAVING HUMILIATED MORE SKILLS SO- AND HAVE THAT KIND OF PATH AS WELL SO- I THINK I KNOW YOU'RE LOOKING AT THAT AND- SO AND BUT- I ALSO HEAR THIS TENSION WITH THE WITH THE- RECIPIENTS THAT OF COURSE THEY DON'T WANNA LOSE.

THANK YOU CHAIR AND I'M GOING TO TURN IT RIGHT OVER ADD TO THAT CURRENCY OUR NEW CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR THAT I INTRODUCED HER. WELCOME TERENZI. THANK YOU CHAIR EGGMAN- AND- SENATOR AND HAPPY TO BE HERE TODAY AND HAPPY TO BE HERE REPRESENTING THE DEPARTMENT- AND I'M GONNA BE TALKING TODAY ABOUT- THE EXERCISES G. PROGRAM. AND ANSWERING YOUR QUESTIONS- SO ARE THE FIRST QUESTION WAS TO PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF THE PROPOSED TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE BUDGET THE SSI PROGRAM. SO WE ARE SEEING AN INCREASE IN OUR TOTAL FUND SPENDING FOR THE FISCAL YEAR TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE- IN TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO THE TOTAL PROGRAM COST WAS NINE POINT NINE BILLION DOLLARS IN TOTAL FUN. TWO POINT NINE BILLION OF THAT WAS GENERAL FUND. WE ARE ANTICIPATING A PROJECTED INCREASE TO TEN POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS IN TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE WITH THREE POINT ONE BILLION THE GENERAL FUND. WE ARE PROJECT. A CASELOAD DECREASED A SLIGHT ONE. RIGHT NOW IN TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO OUR CASELOAD IS ONE POINT ONE THREE SEVEN BILLION- CALIFORNIANS. AND WE'RE PROJECTING THAT DECREASED JUST SLIGHTLY- ONE POINT ONE. ZERO NINE HUNDRED THOUSAND- CALIFORNIA SO ONE POINT NINE. ONE SIX SIX ME- AND WE ARE SEEING THAT THE- OVERALL INCREASE IN SPENDING IS GOING TO BE DRIVEN. BY A COUPLE OF THINGS- WE WILL BE TAKING THE FULL YEAR IMPACT. OF OUR OF FIVE POINT NINE FEDERAL- COST OF LIVING INCREASE. AND WE WILL BE SEEING THE FULL IMPACT OF R. TWENTY THREE POINT NINE FIVE PERCENT. INCREASE IN OUR S. P. GRANTS WILL. AGAIN WE THINK THE LEGISLATURE FOR WORKING WITH THE ADMINISTRATION. TO MAKE BACKGROUND INCREASE THE REALITY. I AND WE ARE THAT- WE WILL ALSO HAVE A HALF YOUR IMPACT OR THE ANTICIPATED TWO POINT THREE. PERCENT FEDERAL COLA THAT WE- DENTISTRY WILL TAKE PLACE. NEXT FOR THE SECOND HALF OF OUR FISCAL YEAR- THAT IS OVERDUE FOR QUESTION NUMBER ONE- FOR OUR- SECOND QUESTION. THIS WAS A QUESTION RELATED TO POTENTIALLY LOOKING AT THE CLIENT INVOLVEMENT IN OUR SS I SS P. AND- WHAT RELIANCE YOU SEE TECHNOLOGY HAVING AND HOW WE CAN MAKE SURE PEOPLE ARE BENEFITING. FROM THE PROGRAM THAT WE WANT PEOPLE TO BENEFIT FROM SO I BELIEVE THE COMMUNITIES WHERE THE EXERCISE IS- LARGELY A FEDERALLY RUN PROGRAM AND THE STATE'S OUR PORTION IS REALLY AROUND. OF FUNDING ACCESS P. AND MAKING THE PAYMENTS- AND WE DO WANT TO CLARIFY ONE THING THE QUESTION ARE COUNTY THIS IS ARE OPEN BUT THOSE ARE NOT MINISTERS. THE S. S. I. S. B. APPLICATIONS AND WHO INVESTORS ALSO SIDE BUT INSTEAD IS A SOCIAL SECURITY YOUNG OFFICERS AND THOSE HAVE BEEN CLOSED SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE PANDEMIC- THE LATEST WE HAVE RECEIVED WORD FROM SOCIAL SECURITY IS THAT THEY ARE TENTATIVELY RE OPENING IN EARLY APRIL OF THIS YEAR. BUT THAT DATE HAS BEEN PUSHED BACK MORE THAN ONCE WHEN DIFFERENT VARIANTS HAVE- HAVE BECOME SURGES AND WE. SAW THAT RECENTLY WITH ON- THERE ARE FEDERAL RESOURCE OF THE- FROM S. HELP. FACILITATE PICKING UP ADURING THIS TIME- INCLUDING AWAY PAGE SHE WAS. OUR PEOPLE OUR FAMILY MEMBERS AND FRIENDS TO HELP MULTIPLY. AND A LITTLE. OFFER IN PERSON APPOINTMENTS- TO ADDRESS CRITICAL NEEDS- AND WHEN CLIENTS HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO USE AS A STAYS AUTOMATED SYSTEM TO MEET THAT NEED. WE DO THINK THOUGH IT WILL BE EXTREMELY IMPORTANT BUT THE FIELD OFFICES TO JUST BE REAL. I WE DO HAVE SOME- DATA RESTRICTIONS ARE ARE YOU KNOW KNOWING WHO'S APPLYING BUT WE ARE REALLY COMMITTED. TO MAKING SURE WE'RE MAKING THIS PROGRAM STRONG AND I CALIFORNIANS CAN ACCESS- THE ONE PROGRAM I DO WANT TO HIGHLIGHT WHICH WE'LL TALK ABOUT MORE EXPLICITLY WITHIN A HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS PROGRAM AT NEXT WEEK'S SENATE HEARING. BUT WE DO HAVE OUR H. SHOP WHICH IS OUR HOUSING AND DISABILITY ADVOCACY PROGRAM. ON YOUR MEMBER THAT BUDGET YOU'RE TWENTY ONE INCLUDED AN ADDITIONAL TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS OF ONGOING FUNDING FOR EACH JOB. BUT WE ALSO START I. A TOTAL OF A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION ONE TIME. IN FISCAL YEAR TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO ANOTHER HUNDRED FIFTY AND TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE. OF THAT WE CAN EXPAND THROUGH JUNE OF TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. SO REALLY EXCITED TO SEE ADDITIONAL SUPPORT AND R. H. DOT PROGRAMS- TO MAKE SURE THAT CLIENTS ARE ABLE TO- APPLY FOR SSI AND OTHER DISABILITY BENEFITS AND ALSO. IN COMBINATION WITH ANY HOUSING SUPPORT- WITHOUT BECAUSE IF THERE ARE ANY QUESTIONS ON SSI SS PROGRAM. DEPARTMENT FINANCE. NONCONFORMING IF THEY NEED SOMETHING FURTHER UP THE INTERVIEW QUESTIONS HELLO. YES AND WE ALSO RECENTLY PUBLISHED OUR ANALYSIS OF THE EXERCISES P. BUDGET LAST WEEK I'M IN IN PARTICULAR- WE FLAG THAT THE GOVERNOR'S INTENDS TO PROVIDE ANOTHER ASSIST BE GRANT INCREASE IN TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR I'M GENERAL GENERALLY ALIGNS WITH INTENT LANGUAGE ADOPTED AND THE LAST YEAR'S BUDGET- THAT HAD THE SAME GOAL. I'M IN PARTICULAR ARE UNDERSTANDING THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET IS THAT THE INTENT IS TO INCREASE S. S. P. GRANTS SO THAT THE TOTAL EXERCISES PETE GRANT I'M REFLECT PRE RECESSION LEVELS I'M IT'S STILL UNCLEAR TO US EXACTLY WHAT PRE RECESSION LEVELS NEED- BUT IT FOR EXAMPLE IF WE ASSUME THAT IT MEANS JANUARY TWO THOUSAND NINE- WHICH WAS GENERALLY THE YEAR AND MONTHS BEFORE WE STARTED- BUT BEFORE THERE WERE MULTIPLE REDUCTIONS TO THE S. S. P. GREEN INCREASED. THEN THE- INTENDED AS IS P. GRANT INCREASE IN TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR WOULD BE MORE THAN ENOUGH TO MEET THAT GOAL. HOWEVER OVERALL WE BELIEVE THAT ALTERNATELY WHATEVER ASSIST HE GRANT INCREASES ADOPTED SHOULD REALLY REFLECT THE LEGISLATURE SCHOOLS WHERE DOES THE LEGISLATURE OPENLY WHAT ULTIMATELY WANT SIZES BE GRANTS TO BE ACT- AND OVER WHAT TIME PERIOD I'M SO IN AREN'T BY NOR ADDITIONAL BUDGET ANALYSIS WE JUST LAID OUT. POSSIBLE EXAMPLES OF ALTERNATIVE GRANT GOALS SUCH AS INCREASING- S. SIZES P. GRANTS FOR INDIVIDUALS 2100% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL GIVEN THAT COUPLES GRANTS IN THE ESTATE IS P. PROGRAM- FALL ABOVE THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL ANOTHER EXAMPLE THAT WE INCLUDE IN OUR POST IS- AT RESTORING THE PURCHASING POWER THAT'S BEEN LOST SINCE TWO THOUSAND NINE- TO ACCOUNT FOR INFLATION- AND IN OUR POST WE LAID OUT- VARIOUS COST ESTIMATES ASSOCIATED WITH THOSE. IMPOSSIBLE GOALS I'M ONCE THE LEGISLATURE. THE SPECIFIC AS PEOPLE'S COULD THAT CAN OVER TIME IT WOULD LIKE TO IN THOSE CALL IT COULD BE A FROM YEAR- BUT ALSO CAN- PROVIDE. ANNUAL COLD AND A WAY TO MAKE. THE DOLLAR VALUE- OF THE GRANTS ONCE YOU ACHIEVE YOUR GOAL- OVERALL THOUGH AND THERE'S ALSO THAT THEY NEED TO CONSIDER BALANCING- AND THE LONG TERM COSTS. OF AS IS BE GREAT INCREASES IN COAL ONCE I'M WITH THE ABILITY TO SUSTAIN. THOSE COSTS IN THE FUTURE YEARS. BY OVERALL I WE WOULD JUST THAT- ONE A PROJECT. S. P. GRANT INCREASE IS IT IS DECIDED UPON I'M THE LEGISLATURE MAY ALSO WANT TO CONSIDER LOOKING BACK AT THE- STATUTORY LANGUAGE AROUND THE- TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR S. B. GRANT AND INCREASE INTENT LANGUAGE- JUST BECAUSE WHILE IT DOES PROVIDE THAT SPECIFIC START DATE OF TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR. THE LANGUAGE ISN'T NECESSARILY VERY TIGHT WHEN IT COMES TO BE EXACT GRANT AMOUNT- AS A UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE TWENTY FOUR THAT THE APPROXIMATELY 24% RATE INCREASE THAT- IS INTENDED TO BE PROVIDED IN TWENTY TWO TWENTY FOUR IS AN ESTIMATE. I'M SO TO THE EXTENT THAT THAT SUBJECT TO CHANGE- THE LEGISLATURE MAY WANT TO CONSIDER DOES IT WANT TO LOCK IN A CERTAIN GRANT AMOUNT RIGHT NOW THAT WOULD BE PROVIDED I'M IN FUTURE YEAR. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. DOCTOR JOHNSON DO YOU HAVE ANY COMMENT ABOUT. DID YOU MEAN PRE RECESSION TWO THOUSAND NINE OR DO WE KNOW. WHAT WE MEAN. S. ONE MAYBE ASK MY CALLED THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IF THEY WANNA. AT IN HERE THANK YOU THANKS THINK EXPLANATION MUCH LIKE HE HAD MENTIONED- WATER THAT WE DID NEED THAT RECESSION. IN TOTAL. MUGGLES.

FOR THAT- BRIEF OVERVIEW- AGE BUT- THIS PROGRAM IS PREDOMINATELY FUNDED THE REAL TWENTY. REALIGNED THROUGH THE- SERVICES HOW- HOW. THE BUDGET ACT TWENTY ONE. DID GIVE A SEVEN MILLION DOLLAR ST JOHN FUND. AND ALLOCATE. WHEN IT. OF THE- PROGRAM. AND THAT X. PREDOMINATELY THE BIGGEST PIECE OF THAT IS TO ENABLE THE APS PROGRAM- YOU SERVE INDIVIDUALS THAT OUR ELDERS BETWEEN THE AGE OF SIXTY AND SIXTY FOUR- PRIOR TO JANUARY FIRST. TWENTY TWENTY TWO- THE DEFINITION OF OLDER FOR PURPOSES OF APIA. WITH AGES SIXTY FIVE AND OVER HOWEVER THE BUDGET AX CHANGE THAT.

REQUIRED PDF DEVELOP THE STATE WITH THE WORK THAT FLORIDA FEASIBILITY AT EIGHT WIDE AUTUMN EIGHT CASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM DATA. THE STAFF AND WE WILL TALK ON THAT- FURTHER DOWN IN THE CLASS. HE IN ADDITION TO- REALIGNMENT AND ARE SEVENTY NINE DOLLARS THE GENERAL FUND- LAST YEAR. EFF RECEIVE NINE POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS IN ONE TIME FUNDING- OF FOUR APR FOUR CO THAT NNETEEN REALLY- THIS WAS SPENDING THAT WAS DISTRIBUTED TO APS PROGRAMS IN ALL FIFTY STATES. IN ORDER TO ADDRESS GAPS THAT CAME OUT FOR THE SECOND SERVICES PROGRAM DURING THE COMING NINETEENTH AND DONE THAT- IN CALIFORNIA. WHAT WE ARE DOING. WITH THIS MONEY IS. IT WAS ALL DISTRIBUTED EACH COW IF YOU PROGRAM BASED ON- AND FORMULA HE WE SEE AND OPENED. AND COUNTY VENTURA TO USE THAT- FOR DIRECT SERVICES FOR ATS CLIENTS THAT COULD INCLUDE- EMERGENCY HOUSING THAT IS NOT COVERED THROUGH ANY OF OUR OTHER HOUSING PROGRAMS. SUPPLEMENTAL NUTRITION FOR- ANY KIND OF EMERGENCY SITUATION THAT IS COVERED RELATED THAT IS NOT COVERED THROUGH ANY OF OUR NUTRITION PROGRAM. SUPPLEMENTING THE COST OF TRANSPORTATION FOR APS CLIENT- THE X. CONTINUE TO EXPAND- FOR APS CLIENT HEALTH NEEDS. SO THAT WAS WORKING WITH-PUBLIC HEALTH NURSES AND WITH OTHERS TO BE ABLE TO DO HOME VISITS OR ADDRESS- HEALTH DISPARITIES THAT HAPPENED WHILE INDIVIDUALS MORE. ISOLATED DURING THE CAN DOWN THAT. HE AND ALL TWEET YOUR NOW NEED THE- FOR- FOR THAT AS AS WORK- IN ADDITION TO THAT I FOR ME DOLLAR THAT WE FOR HUNDRED REALLY. ATF ALSO A POINT NINE DOLLARS AND ONE FIVE COMEDIAN RED PLAY ASK HE AND I THAT MONEY WAS VERY SIMILAR. HE AS THE SERVICE DAY HOWEVER WITH THE CODES- FOR EVERY THAT WE OFFER IT HAS TO HAVE A SHOT HI YOU CLIENTS THAT WERE IMPACT BY THE- WHERE ALLIED WITH THE ARKANSAS. DOES OUR LITTLE BLOCK. SO FROM THE A POINT SIX MILLION HI OF THOSE WORDS. DIRECTLY YOU CAN. TODAY HE CAN. TO DO THE ACT. THAT WORKED. GEARING UP WITH A CO BAND- AND THEN THE OTHER HALF OF THE FUNDING HAS BEEN FOR A- OF DIFFERENT DAY- STATES WERE ENCOURAGED BY FEDERAL. YOU EXPAND INTO OTHER PROGRAM. SO THE BIG PROJECT THAT WE ARE DOING WITH THE OTHER HALF OF THE FUNDING IS- A CONTRACT WITH THE CALIFORNIA SOCIAL WORK EDUCATION CENTER. TO CONTINUE AND EXPAND OUR REGIONAL TO YOUR FILE IT TIGHTENED AND TRAINING PROGRAM FOR MASTER'S OF SOCIAL WORK DIDN'T MANAGE TO WORKING WITHIN APS PROGRAMS- WE HAD A SMALL PILOT. IN THE BAY AREA OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS TO INCREASE. THE APS. STAFFING AND TRAINING THIS WAS MODELED AFTER THE COMPLEX PROGRAM THAT IS CURRENTLY USED IN CHILD WELFARE- WHERE MSW STUDENTS WERE INTERESTED IN WORKING IN CHILD WELFARE CAN. AND HOW THEIR EDUCATION PAID FOR IN EXCHANGE FOR TWO YEAR OF SERVICE AND CHILD WELFARE MONEY MODEL THIS AFTER THAT WE HAD AND DIDN'T SUCCESSFULLY GOT THERE ARE PILOT. OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS AND SO WE'RE EXCITED TO BE ABLE TO TAKE THE OTHER. SOME OF THIS MONEY THROUGH THE AMERICAN RESCUE ACT AND BANS ABOUT. FURTHER BUT WE ARE- WORK WITH NATIONAL ADULT PROTECTIVE SERVICES ASSOCIATION TO PUT TOGETHER A PUBLIC AWARENESS CAMPAIGN- AROUND ELDER JUSTICE AND AROUND THE BILL PROTECTIVE SERVICES. WITH SOME OF THE SPENDING. AS WELL. WE ARE ANTICIPATING A ANOTHER ROUND OF THE RECORD PLAN AFTER. THIS IS A TO AND HE EIGHT PROGRAM IN THE OF TWENTY ONE TWO.

THANK YOU BIRTHER HARD COURSE I LOVE THE SOCIAL WORK WITH APS M. A PROGRAM. THAT DID YOU DID YOU TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE CASE NUMBER IS GOING DOWN DURING THE PANDEMIC AND TO WHAT DO YOU ATTRIBUTE THAT IN. HOUSE MAKING SURE PEOPLE ARE SAFE. WE DID. SEE A DROP. IN THE CAN DOWN A AND REPORTS RECEIVED ON CASES OPEN FOR ATS- HOWEVER WE HAVE BEEN TRACKING THAT FAIRLY CLOSELY OVER SINCE THE BEGINNING A PANDEMIC. AND WHAT WE HAVE SEEN IS DURING PANDEMICS URGES WE SEE DROPPING CASES AND THEN WHEN. THINGS START TO OPEN BACK UP AGAIN WE SEE THE CASE WITH THE BACK UP AND THE REASON THAT WE BELIEVE THIS IS HAPPENING. IS BECAUSE THE WAY THAT THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE REACHED ATS IT'S REAL- INTERACTION WITH MANDATED REPORTERS. AND WE KNOW THAT THIS POPULATION WAS NOT GOING TO DOCTOR'S APPOINTMENTS THEY WERE NOT- HAVING THE INTERACTION AND THE COMMUNITY THEY WERE NOT GOING TO COMMUNITY SERVICES. WHERE ABUSE CAN BE IDENTIFIED AS QUICKLY. SO WE ARE SEEING THOSE CASES. WHEN I'M. NINE K. FOUR NUMBERS FOR TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY TWENTY AND TWENTY TWENTY ONE. AND I THINK THE BEST WAY THAT WHEN I LOOK AT THOSE NUMBERS I SEE THAT ARE TWENTY TWENTY ONE NUMBERS NATURAL TWENTY NINETEEN NUMBERS A LITTLE BIT MORE. WITH THAT DIFFERENT TWENTY TWENTY AND YOU SEE A LITTLE DEVON THAT IN HALF OVER THE SUMMER OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE WHEN THERE WAS- THE DOLPHINS BIRDS- A LITTLE BIT OF A JOB AGAIN. AND WE REALLY DO THINK THAT THAT IS BECAUSE THERE IS THAT LACK OF INTERACTION WITH MANDATED REPORTER WINDING DOWN OR SHUT DOWN. THE YOU THE DEPARTMENT OF. DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING. NANKANA FINANCE NOTHING FURTHER TO ADD AT THIS TIME EACH ANSWERING QUESTIONS LMAO. AND WE'RE STILL COMPLETING OUR TECHNICAL REVIEW OF THE BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL RELATED TO IT YES I WILL PROVIDE ANY UPDATED COMMENTS TO THE COMMITTEE WANTS TO BE COMPLETED.

OKAY THEY WOULD SAY HOW DID AND KEEP. YEAH I AGAIN JUST TO RECORD THE CROSSED YOU TO CAROLINE REALLY DE AS SERVE THE LIFE AND JACK AS YOU KNOW I HAVE EVERY COMPONENT OF OUR PROGRAMS WHETHER THEY BE A CHILD CARE AND DVELOPMENT PROGRAMS CHILDREN'S RESIDENTIAL OR I DON'T SENIOR CARE HAVE CERTAINLY BEEN IMPACTED BY THE PANDEMIC AND- SO ARE GRATEFUL FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TALK ABOUT THE STRATEGIES THAT WE CAN PLAY TOGETHER- THAT WAYS IN WHICH WE WORK TO ASH INSURE THAT. OUR RESIDENTS AT THESE THEIR HOMES OUT WERE SAFE FOR THEM- AND IN OUR PLANS GOING FORWARD SO I WILL NOW TURN IT OVER TO DEPUTY DIRECTOR KEVIN. GAINES WELCOME TO BE DIRECTOR. THANK YOU THANK YOU WELL I'LL GO AHEAD AND JUST- KEVIN GAINS- APARTMENT- NEED CARE LICENSING DIVISION. I'LL JUST GO AHEAD AND LAUNCH INTO OUR RESPONSES TO THE QUESTIONS THAT ARE PROVIDED TO GET CHECKED- AS FAR AS AN OVERVIEW OF THE PROPOSED TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE BUDGET FOR CCL. I'LL GO AHEAD AND DESCRIBE- THE LIMITED AMOUNT OF FUNDING OBLIGATIONS THAT WERE THAT WERE PROPOSING- OVERALL OUR- OUR GOALS AGGREGATE BUDGET FOR THE DIVISION IS JUST UNDER ONE HUNDRED NINETY SIX MILLION. ON TO COVER THE ACTIVITIES OF. ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED SIXTY THREE- STAFF- HE- YOU HAVE TO PROPOSALS BEFORE YOU. ARE ONE OF THEM IS THE EXPANSION OF A OF A GREAT PROGRAM THAT INVOLVES THE ARE WHO PROVIDE CONSULTATION TO- AT THE LICENSING PROGRAM STAFF REGIONAL OFFICES THROUGHOUT THE STATE ANSEL LICENSEES ON OCCASION. ON ONE AREAS- ASPECTS OF HEALTH AND SAFETY ACT OF THAT THAT FIND THEIR WAY INTO INVESTIGATIONS THAT ANNUAL INSPECTIONS- INCLUDING- CONSULTATION ON ON THAT THAT. THAT THE- THAT HELPS WITH THE BEST. AND THE AND IN A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT AREAS- HE HAD A DURATION- DELAYED MEDICAL TREATMENT- BODILY INJURIES OR HOSPITALIZATIONS- INFECTION CONTROL QUESTIONS MAY BECOME EXTREMELY USEFUL ON DURING THE COURSE OF ENDEMIC AND AN HOUR- IMPRESSION CONTROL PROCEDURES ESPECIALLY WHERE IT RELATES TO IT DON'T SENIOR PARK. ON THE THAT THE PROPOSAL SEEKS TO EXPAND- THE- THE NUMBER CHANGE FROM ONE TO TELL YOU IN ORDER TO MEET. INCREASING DEMAND WE GET ALL THE SENIOR CARE PROGRAM BUT ALSO TO EXPAND- BILLS- SAME SERVICES TO THE CHILDREN'S RESIDENTIAL PROGRAM AND TO TRY OUT. SO OF HUGE BENEFIT THAT WE'RE GETTING FROM OUR- OUR NURSES VALUE WAITERS WOULD LIKE- ON. ALL THREE PROGRAMS. THE OTHER CRITICAL THAT. IS IMPLEMENTATION OF TO- RELATED TO SENATE BILL ACOUSTIC FOUR NOVELS ENACTED THIS YEAR R. REQUIRES THE DEPARTMENT SAID TO MAKE SOME CHANGES TO BE OUR TO THE ARRAY OF- EXEMPTIONS- TO THE POSSIBILITY OF- KURDS EXEMPTIONS AND SO IN ORDER TO- IN- IMPLEMENT THAT PROGRAM- THERE'S SOME INCREASED WORKLOAD THAT INCLUDES REPORTING REQUIREMENTS- SYSTEM ENHANCEMENTS AND OTHER ELEMENTS THAT WOULD. REQUIRE. A TEAM OF PEOPLE TO ACT. I'LL GO AHEAD AND UNLESS THERE ARE QUESTIONS I'LL GO AHEAD TO THE SECOND QUESTION- WHICH IS- AN UPDATE. OF THE ROLLOUT OF OUR CHAIR INSPECTIONS WILL- THERE WAS A QUESTION REGARDING- WHEN WE'RE EXPECTING TO IMPLEMENT FOR ALL- GRANTS. AND SO AS BUSINESS AS THIS COMMITTEE KNOWS I IMAGINE- THEY'D BE- HE COMMUNITY CARE LICENSING DIVISION IS. SPLITTING INTO THREE PRIMARY PROGRAM CLUSTERS THE CHILD CARE PROGRAMS CHILDREN'S RESIDENTIAL PROGRAM AND THE ADULTS SENIOR CARE PROGRAM ALL THREE PROGRAMS HAVE IMPLEMENTED AT LEAST IN PART ON ON IN IN PERSON FACILITY INSPECTIONS USING WHAT WE CALL COMPLIANCE AND REGULATORY ENFORCEMENT WORK HERE TO. ON THE CHILD CARE PROGRAM BEGAN USING THEIR FULL SLATE OF A CARE TOOLS FOR ANNUAL INSPECTION. BACULUM ON NOVEMBER FIRST OF LAST YEAR. AND IS SOON TO LAUNCH A- RELICENSING TOOLS AS WELL IN THE EXPECT THAT TO HAPPEN MARCELLO SHE- IT SHOWS RESIDENTIAL PROGRAM. AND ANNUAL INSPECTIONS- USING THE CARE TOOLS FOR I LOVE THAT THE NINETEEN CATEGORIES- OF PROGRAMS. BACK ON JULY FIRST OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND WE EXPECT TO IMPLEMENT THE REST OF THE WORLD- THE CHILDREN'S RESIDENTIAL PROGRAMS WITH YOUR TOOLS- ROUND SUMMER JULY. YEAH OUR HEARTS ARE. THAT'S WHERE DOES SENIOR CARE PROGRAMS THEY ARE IMPLEMENTING- INSPECTION OF PORTION OF. ON THE ONE THAT IS SPECIFICALLY DEDICATED TO YOU. ACTUALLY CONTROL. NO SECRETS THIS BODY BACK THE- AT THE END AND IT HAS- PROVIDED A GREATER RISK IN A GREATER IMPACT IN OUR DON'T SENIOR COMMUNITIES AND SO WHILE THE- WHILE THE OTHER PROGRAMS HAVE RECEDED FOR WAR ON IMPLEMENTATION OF THE FULL SLATED CARE. TOOLS WE'RE LIMITING OUR- IN. OF THE CARE CENTER WITHIN ADULT AND SENIOR ONTARIO INSPECTIONS ARE USING BE INSPECTION CONTROL DOMAIN WHICH IS FAIRLY EXPENSIVE UNIT IN ITSELF.
