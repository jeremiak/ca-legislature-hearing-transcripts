YOU VERY MUCH- APPRECIATE THAT GOOD AFTERNOON EVERYONE I AM ASSEMBLY MEMBER MARC LEVINE AND I WOULD LIKE TO CALL THE ASSEMBLY SELECT COMMITTEE ON FOOD SYSTEMS TO ORDER WELL THE ASSEMBLY IS LIFTED ITS COVERT NINETEEN PROTOCOLS MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC ATTENDING TODAY HERE TODAY'S HEARING ARE ENCOURAGED TO WEAR A MASK INTO OBSERVE APPROPRIATE SOCIAL DISTANCING IF FIVE APPROPRIATE- MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC NOT LISTED ON THE AGENDA ARE WELCOME TO PROVIDE PUBLIC COMMENT AT THE END OF TODAY'S HEARING HERE IN ROOM ONE TWENTY SEVEN. IF A MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC IS NOT ABLE TO ATTEND TODAY'S HEARING THE COMMITTEES- THE COMMITTEE WELCOMES WRITTEN TESTIMONY WHICH CAN BE EMAILED TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER DOT LEVINE AT ASSEMBLY DOT CA DOT GOV THAT'S ASSEMBLY MEMBER DOT LEVINE ASSEMBLY DOT CA DOT GOV. I WOULD ALSO ENCOURAGE THE PUBLIC TO CONNECT WITH US ON SOCIAL MEDIA. AT ASM MARC LEVINE TO CONTINUE THIS CONVERSATION TO STAY CONNECTED ON IMPORTANT LEGISLATIVE ISSUES. FEW ISSUES HAVE UNIVERSALLY IMPACTED FAMILIES ACROSS CALIFORNIA IN JUST THE PAST YEAR LIKE THE INFLATIONARY IMPACT ON FOOD PRICES ACCORDING TO THE US DEPARTMENT OF LABOR HOUSEHOLD GROCERY BILLS SWELLED BY EIGHT POINT 6% IN THE LAST TWELVE MONTHS THE LARGEST JUMP SINCE APRIL NINETEEN EIGHTY ONE. FOOD AT HOME PRICES ARE EXPECTED TO INCREASE BETWEEN 3% AND 4% BY THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO ACCORDING TO A RECENT US DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE FORECAST WAGES ARE NOT ABLE TO KEEP PACE WITH THE INCREASED COST OF NECESSITIES AND FOOD ACCESS ORGANIZATIONS ARE STRUGGLING TO ADDRESS. INCREASED DEMAND THAT BEGAN DURING THE KOBE NINETEEN PANDEMIC. ACCORDING TO AN APRIL TWENTY TWENTY TWO ARTICLE BY CNBC THE COST OF MEAT POULTRY FISH AND EGGS IS 13% HIGHER SINCE FEBRUARY TWENTY TWENTY ONE. FRESH FRUIT HAS GONE UP TEN POINT 6% IN PRICE IN THAT TIME WHILE THE PRICE FOR VEGETABLES HAS REMAINED MORE STABLE INCREASING JUST FOUR POINT THREE PERCENT. THE PRICE OF PRE PACKAGED CEREALS AND BAKED GOODS HAS INCREASED SEVEN POINT 7% THIS IS NOT SUSTAINABLE FOR MANY FAMILIES. ALL CALIFORNIANS ARE FEELING THE PINCH AND FAMILIES THAT RELY ON FOOD ASSISTANCE AND SUPPORT FROM FOOD BANKS ARE SPECIALLY VULNERABLE TO THESE DRAMATIC INCREASES IN EVERYDAY FOOD COSTS. THE UNITED STATES FOOD SYSTEM IS A COMPLEX WEB OF PRODUCTION PROCESSING TRANSPORT AND CONSUMPTION. EACH SEGMENT OF OUR FOOD SYSTEM HAS BEEN DIRECTLY IMPACTED BY INFLATION MAKING THIS PERIOD OF TIME DIFFICULT FOR FOOD GROWERS FOOD PRODUCERS WORKERS IN THE FOOD AND LOGISTICS INDUSTRIES AND MOST IMPORTANTLY CALIFORNIA CONSUMER. TODAY'S HEARING IS PART OF A BROADER DISCUSSION ABOUT ADDRESSING FOOD INSECURITY. PROMOTING EQUITABLE FOOD ACCESS AND ADDRESSING THE SHORT AND LONG TERM IMPACTS OF INFLATION ON CALIFORNIA FOOD SYSTEMS. I WANT TO THANK TODAY'S PANELISTS FOR PARTICIPATING THIS HEARING AND ACCEPTING THE INVITATION TO JOIN US. AND LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR TESTIMONY THIS AFTERNOON. I WANT TO THANK GOD. ALSO THE STAFF IN THE AUDIO VIDEO- TEAM- FOR MAKING SURE THAT THIS IS RUNNING AWAY THAT EVERYONE CAN HAVE ACCESS TO IT. AT THIS TIME- I WOULD LIKE TO INTRODUCE THE FIRST PANEL AND THE FIRST PANEL IS A PANEL ONE IS WHY IS INFLATION HAPPENING NOW AND WHAT ARE ITS IMPACTS ON FOOD SYSTEMS. OUR FIRST PANELIST WELL MENTION BOTH OF THEM DR JERRY NICHOLS BURKE FROM UCLA SCHOOL OF MANAGEMENT ANDERSON SCHOOL OF MANAGEMENT AND DR DANIELS DANIEL SUMNER UC DAVIS SCHOOL OF AGRICULTURE. DR NICHOLS BURKE YOU ARE UP FIRST IN YOUR JOINING US VIRTUALLY. DR NICK SO WE SEE YOU NOW. BUT WE DON'T HEAR YOU YET. WHAT CAN WE GET WE GOT A- DO A COUPLE THINGS I THINK STILL GET YOUR AUDIO. I THINK YOU'RE GOOD NOW. NO BUT THERE. FOR THE FOLKS YOU AT HOME WE DID DO AN AUDIO TRACK AND THINGS WORKED EARLIER AS A THANK YOU DOCTOR ISN'T NIKOLSBURG FOR HELPING US- PREPARE AND- AND WE'RE WORKING ON IT. YOU KNOW WHAT. YOU ARE NOW GOOD TO GO. THAT WAS THAT WAS ME BY THE WAY ABSOLUTELY. OKAY- WELL FIRST OF ALL- LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK ABOUT INFLATION IN CALIFORNIA YEAH AND TO MY COLLEAGUES ON THIS PANEL- GOING TO DRILL DOWN ON SOME OF THE GEOGRAPHICAL AND SOCIO ECONOMIC IMPACTS THAT WOULD I'D LIKE TO FOCUS MY REMARKS ON- WHO IS THE MACROECONOMIC SETTING OF INFLATION AND WHERE WE THINK. IT'S GOING AND WHY. IT AS IT TURNS OUT JUST TO START WITH SOME DEFINITIONS THE INFLATION IN GENERAL IS VERY DIFFICULT TO MEASURE. THAT IS IN THE ECONOMIC DEFINITION IS OUR RIGHTS AND ALL PRICES. OVER ALL PRICES OF COURSE ARE NOT EQUAL A 20% INCREASE IN THE PRICE FOR A JAR OF PAPRIKA IS NOT THE SAME IN TERMS OF THE ECONOMIC AND WELFARE IMPACT OF THE 20% INCREASE. IN THE PRICE OF A GALLON OF GASOLINE. THE US BUREAU CENSUS FINANCES THIS ISSUE BY USING A WEIGHTED SAMPLE OF PRICES WITH THE WEIGHTS FOR FROM THE THREE YEAR SURVEY OF URBAN CONSUMER BUYING HABITS. FROM THE EARLY NINETEEN EIGHTIES OF COURSE OUR BUYING HABITS ARE DIFFERENT TODAY BUT TO HAVE A CONSISTENT MEASURE THE WEIGHTS CHANGE PRINCIPALLY TO REFLECT THE QUALITY AND TECHNOLOGY CHANGES OVER TIME. NOT THE CHANGES IN OUR TASTES AND PREFERENCES SO THAT'S A WAY OF SAYING THAT YOU KNOW WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THESE INFLATION NUMBERS. WITH THE- BIT OF SKEPTICISM ABOUT THE OVERALL HEADLINE NUMBERS AND DIG DOWN DEEPER. FOR THE U. S. THE AVERAGE RATE OF INFLATION AS MEASURED BY THE CONSUMER PRICE INDEX FOR ALL CONSUMERS. OVER THE PAST TWELVE MONTHS WAS EIGHT POINT THREE PERCENT. I BUT IT'S DIFFERENT AS WE MOVE ACROSS THE COUNTRY FOR LOS ANGELES MSA WHICH INCLUDES ORANGE COUNTY WAS SEVEN POINT NINE PERCENT. FOR THE SAN FRANCISCO MSA WHICH INCLUDES THE EAST BAY IT WAS ONLY FIVE PERCENT. AND MUCH OF THIS DIFFERENCE IS DUE TO THE IMPACT OF CHANGES IN SHELTER COSTS AND HOW THEY ENTER THE CONSUMER PRICE INDEX. SHELTERS APPROXIMATELY ONE THIRD OF THE CPI. AND IT IS A MEASUREMENT MEASURED AS AN AVERAGE OF RENTS PAID BY RENTERS. AND OWNERS OF QUICKLY WRAP WHICH IS NOT PAID BY HOMEOWNERS. AND IS ABOUT 55% OF ALL CAT CALIFORNIA HOUSEHOLDS. IT IS THE RENT THAT THEY WOULD PAY THEY. WERE RENTING THEIR HOME RATHER THAN BUYING IT. SO IN FACT THE C. THAT OVER. AHEAD NUMBER IS MY MORE REP. OF THE IMPACT OF PRICE INCREASES. ON THE APPROXIMATE ONE HALF OF CALIFORNIANS WHO RENT. IN THESE ARE OF COURSE DISPROPORTIONATELY LESS AFFLUENT HOUSEHOLDS. THE BIG DRIVERS OF INFLATION IN THE US TODAY OUR AUTOMOBILES ENERGY FOOD AIRPLANE FLIGHTS AND SHELTER. ORDER PRICES SHOULD DECLINE AS A SHORTAGE OF CHIPS EASES AND WHAT THAT WILL TAKE TIME THE TREND IS CLEAR. ENERGY PRICES HAVE STABILIZED ALBEIT AT A HIGH LEVEL BUT THEIR IMPACT THROUGH THE ECONOMY IS STILL BEING FELT IMPORTANT IS THE ROLE OF WHAT THAT OIL PRICES HAVE IN THE PRODUCTION OF FOOD BUT DIRECTLY EMPOWERING FARM EQUIPMENT AND TRUCKING. AND THROUGH THEIR INFO IMPORTANCIA FERTILIZER HIGH ENERGY PRICES ARE NOT EXPECTED TO DECLINE AS THE WAR RAGES ON IN THE UKRAINE. AND THE ABILITY OF PRODUCERS ELSEWHERE TO RAMP UP PRODUCTION BEING DEPENDENT ON INVESTMENT IN DRILLING RIGS. I NEVER THE LESS FURTHER INCREASES ARE NOT EXPECTED. AND SO THAT'S THE GOOD NEWS AND BAD NEWS WILL GROWTH GOING TO HAVE HIGHER OIL PRICES HIGHER FERTILIZER PRICES FOR SOME TIME BUT NOT INCREASING IN ANY SIGNIFICANT WAY OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS. AIRPLANE FLIGHTS REPRESENT OF RECOVERY FROM VERY LOW RATES AND THEY ARE THEMSELVES NOT EXPECTED TO INCREASE AT THE SAME RATE GOING FORWARD AND SHELTER COST INCREASES HAVE OUTSTIPPED THE INCREASE IN HOUSEHOLD INCOMES AND WHILE THERE'S AN EXPECTATION DUE TO DEMOGRAPHICS. AND POST CODE THE CHANGE HOUSEHOLD PREFERENCES FOR MORE SPACE THIS WILL CONTINUE TO HOLD INFLATION RATES HIGH OVER THE COMING YEAR. ABOUT ONE OF THE LARGEST DRIVERS OF INFLATION TODAY AS WITH POINTED OUT IN THE INTRODUCTION IS FOOD AND A BIG PART OF THIS STEMS FROM THE PRODUCTION OF WHEAT. NOT ONLY OUR PRODUCTION COSTS HIGHER DUE TO THE INCREASE IN THE PRICE OF OIL BUT THE SUPPLY IS BEEN SERIOUSLY CURTAILED. THE LARGEST WORLD WHEAT PRODUCERS IN THE WORLD ARE THE US RUSSIA INDIA AND CHINA IN THE US AND ELSEWHERE PRODUCTION IS DOWN SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE U. S. ABOUT 8% LITTLE MORE THAN 8% DUE TO DROUGHT. CHINA DOES NOT PRODUCE AND FOR ITS NEEDS IN PUT AT THE ON X. AND THE WHEAT PRODUCING REGION IN INDIA SUFFERING FROM EXTREME HEAT. AND THE RUSSIAN SUPPLIES NOW BEEN CUT OFF. THIS WILL INDUCE A SUBSTITUTION TO OTHER GRAINS SUCH AS CORN AND RICE AND THEIR PRICES WILL THEN INCREASE. IN ADDITION TO THE HIGH PRICE OF GASOLINE A SHIFT- THERE'S A SHIFT IN IN DEMAND TO ETHANOL WHICH WILL ALSO INCREASE THE DEMAND. AND THE PRICE OF CORN. THAT BECAUSE- CALIFORNIA'S LARGE AGRICULTURAL HE BECAUSE OF CALIFORNIA'S LARGE AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRY. GOOD PRICE INFLATION IS LIGHTLY LIKELY TO BE SLIGHTLY LOWER. IN TERMS OF THE RATE OF INCREASE. THEN THE US GOING FORWARD BUT NOT BY MUCH. MORE OVER THE SECTORS IN CALIFORNIA THAT HAVE NOT SUBSTANTIALLY RECOVERED FROM THE TWENTY TWENTY RECESSION. BY THE SERVICE SECTORS WITH THE AVERAGE INCOME OF THOSE EMPLOYED IS LOWER THAN THE MEDIAN INCOME IN CALIFORNIA. N. THERE IS A MUCH GREATER NUMBER OF PREVIOUSLY EMPLOYED OUT OF WORK ON AVERAGE CALIFORNIANS SPEND ABOUT 13% A LITTLE MORE THAN 13% OF THEIR INCOME ON FOOD. UP WITH ABOUT TWO THIRDS OF THAT THE INQUEST REPURCHASES LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS WILL SPEND AT LEAST DOUBLE THAT PERCENTAGE OF THEIR INCOME. IN THESE ARE THE HOUSEHOLDS THAT ARE FACING THE MORE DIFFICULT EMPLOYMENT MARKETS AND THEY ARE CLEARLY THE MOST IMPACTED BY THE CURRENT. AND WHAT WE EXPECT TO BE THE INCREASING COST OF GOING FORWARD. AND WITH THAT I WILL CONCLUDE MY REMARKS THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH DOCTOR NIKOLSBURG- NOT SURE IF WE HAVE DOCTOR SUMNER HERE. YEAH VIDEO GREAT I THANK YOU. AND PLEASE STICK AROUND FOR SOME Q. AND A ON FOR THE PANEL. DR SUMMER. YES ABOUT MY AUDIO WE ARE HERE YOU FIND WE DON'T SEE A HERE WE SEE YOU NOW. NICE HOUSE. THANK YOU. SEEM LIKE THE RIGHT BACKGROUND FOR THIS MEETING WELL GET STARTED IT AND ASSUME YOU'LL GET THE VIDEO UP EUROPE THANK YOU ALL RIGHT. AND I'M GONNA USE THE FEW MINUTES AVAILABLE TO MAKE UP A FEW VERY BRIEF POINTS ABOUT THE CURRENT BOUT OF INFLATION IN CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURE AS WE'VE WE'VE JUST HEARD INFLATION IS THE WIDESPREAD CONTINUED RATE OF INCREASE IN OF THE GENERAL LEVEL OF PRICES OF GOODS AND SERVICES IN THE ECONOMY. ALL SPECIFIC FARM PRICES ALL SUCH AS FOR EXAMPLE ALMONDS AND ALFALFA TO TAKE TO IMPORTANT CALIFORNIA CROPS A JUMP UP AND DOWN FROM MONTH TO MONTH AND FROM YEAR TO YEAR. OFFER COMMODITY SPECIFIC REASONS- LIKE US SUPPLY SHOCK BAD WEATHER. OR FOR THAT MATTER GREAT WEATHER PRICES GO UP AND DOWN. ALL BUT THIS FLUX. IN RELATIVE PRICES ISN'T INFLATION SO FOR EXAMPLE IN TWENTY TWENTY TWO WHAT PRICES ARE DOWN. DUE TO LOW OF LESS WORLD DEMAND FOR COMPLICATED REASONS OF BLOOD EIGHT PRICES ARE ARE UP A LOT AND THAT'S DUE TO AN OUTBREAK OF AVIAN INFLUENZA AGAIN NEITHER ONE OF THOSE ARE REALLY INFLATION- DEFINED AS WE THINK ABOUT INFLATION. AND IN PARTICULAR OF THE FED FOR EXAMPLE ATTENDS TO DISCOUNT OF FOOD PRICES IT WHEN THEY TALK ABOUT INFLATION THEIR PREFERRED MEASURE TO TALK ABOUT INFLATION BECAUSE THERE'S SO MUCH IDIOSYNCRATIC FLUX IN IN FARM PRICES AND FARM COMMODITY PRICES IN THE FOODS MOST TIED. CLOSELY TIED TO THEM. I WILL ALSO SAY THAT FOOD PRICES. THAT YOU AND I BY IN THE RETAIL STORE ARE MOSTLY COMPRISED OF LABOR AND REAL ESTATE AND ALL THE COSTS THAT GO INTO MARKETING. AND OF THE FARM PRICES OR FOR EXAMPLE A RELATIVELY SMALL PART OF THAT. ABOUT 50% FOR MILK WHICH OF FOR FLUID MILK WHICH GOES PRETTY MUCH DIRECTLY TO THE SUPERMARKET WITH VERY LITTLE PROCESSING. WHAT WE HEARD A DISCUSSION ABOUT THE PRICE OF WHEAT. AND MOST OF US EAT OUR WAY WE CAN THE FORMAL PASTA OR BREAD OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. AND THE FARM PRICE A WEEK IS BETWEEN FIVE AND 10% OF THE RETAIL PRICES OF THE GOODS THAT HAVE WHEAT IN THEM. AND THAT'S SOMETHING TO REMEMBER WHEN WE THINK ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS ON THE FARM AND WHAT THAT MEANS OF FOR RETAIL PRICES FOR ALL OF US. BOB THE COST OF INPUTS FOR CALIFORNIA FARMS AND RANCHES HAVE BEEN RISING BECAUSE OF THE ENGINE IN GENERAL INFLATION RATE. AND BECAUSE OF THESE IDIOSYNCRATIC ONE TIME REASONS. IN THESE HIGHER COSTS SQUEEZE THE BOTTOM LINE IN FOR SUPPLY ADJUSTMENTS. I'M GONNA TALK ABOUT A FEW OF THOSE A LITTLE BIT LATER BUT LET ME MENTION SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN IN THE NEWS A LOT AND THAT IS. ALL HIGH PRICE OF FERTILIZERS. THEY'RE TIED TO NATURAL GAS THEY'RE ALSO TIED. UP ALL THE IMPORTS AND EXPORTS. BUT WHAT ABOUT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT FERTILIZER PRICES WE SHOULD RECOGNIZE THE DAY BEGAN RISING AFTER YEARS OF FAIRLY STABLE OF PRICES THEY BEGAN RISING IN MID TWENTY TWENTY. AND WENT AND DOUBLED BY THE TIME WE GOT TO THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE. ARE THEY RISEN 15% THIS YEAR ALL OF WHICH OCCURRED. AFTER THE MIDDLE OF MARCH SO THAT IS WE HAD BLACK FERTILIZER PRICES AT HIGH LEVELS. BUT THEN THEY TOOK OFF WELL AT THE TIME OF THE RUSSIAN INVASION OF UKRAINE. AND THEN THEY'VE THEY'VE ACTUALLY STABILIZE THE LAST FEW WEEKS SO THEY HAVEN'T CONTINUE TO RISE THERE WAS A BIG ZOOM. AND THEN OF FLAT AGAIN IN MOST. PROJECTIONS FOR WHAT THEY'RE WORTH ALL ARE SUGGESTING THAT FERTILIZER PRICES ALL ARE LIKELY TO BE STABLE NOT COME DOWN BUT BE STABLE IN MY COLLEAGUE AARON SMITH. HAS ANALYZED- THOSE FERTILIZER PRICES IN SOME DETAIL. THE THIRD THING I WANT TO MENTION IS THAT ARM. AS FARMERS BY THE FULL RANGE OF GOODS AND SERVICES FROM THE ECONOMY EVERYTHING. UP FROM FROM FARM LABOR TO SERVICES ACCOUNTING SERVICES FOR EXAMPLE INFLATION IN THE GENERAL ECONOMY AFFECTS COSTS ON FARMS I'LL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE THE PRICE OF HOUSING IN L. A. GOES UP AND WE JUST HEARD HOUSING IS A BIG PART OF THE INFLATION RATE FOR CONSUMERS. WHAT IS THAT HAVE TO DO WITH FARMS- WORKERS OF COMPETE FOR HIGHER WAGES IF AN ACCOUNTING FIRM WANTS TO KEEP ITS WORKERS IT PAYS MORE. THE COST OF ACCOUNTING SERVICES TO A FARM OF THEN GOES UP AND SO THESE THINGS ARE VERY CLOSELY CONNECTED AND WHAT YOU THINK IS TWO OR THREE STEPS AWAY FROM THE FARM WILL AFFECT FORM COSTS. AND THAT'S IMPORTANT. BOB THERE ARE ALSO FAR- SPECIFIC- OF FORM FACTORS THAT AFFECT NDIVIDUAL MARKETS FOR EXAMPLE I MENTIONED WALNUT FARMS WILL BE HARD HIT BY INFLATION BUT THEY'RE ASO FACING DROUGHT THEY'RE ALSO FACING PORT PROBLEMS FOR THEIR EXPORTS BECAUSE THE BACK CALL ISSUE OF SHIPPING CONTAINERS AND ALL THEY'VE BEEN FACING MORE COMPETITION IN GROUP GROWING MARKETS SO THERE'S NO REASON TO THINK WALMART PRICES ARE GOING TO BE MUCH HIGHER IN TWENTY TWENTY TWO AND THAT'S A REALLY SERIOUS PROBLEM BECAUSE THEIR COSTS ARE GOING UP BECAUSE THE INFLATION. AND THAT'S A CHALLENGE FOR CERTAIN INDUSTRIES LET ME TAKE THE LAST COUPLE OF MINUTES TO TALK ABOUT HIRED FARM WORKERS BECAUSE THERE ARE A CRUCIAL AND CENTRAL PART OF AGRICULTURE. LIKE FOR EXAMPLE FOOD SERVICE WORKERS. THEY ARE AMONG THE MOST LOW WAGE AND VULNERABLE PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA RISING BUT IT'S HARD FOR THOSE WAGES TO KEEP UP FOR WITH INFLATION LET ME JUST GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE SO YOU HAVE WORKERS ON A FARM IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY OF CALIFORNIA. THAT HAS- THE WAGE RATE GOES FRM TWENTY BUCKS AN HOUR TO TWENTY ONE FIFTY THIS SUMMER. THAT'S NOT ENOUGH TO KEEP UP WITH INFLATION FOR THOSE WORKERS. IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO KEEP UP WITH THEIR FOOD PRICE INFLATION. FURTHERMORE FOR THOSE WORKERS THE DROUGHT IS GOING TO MEAN LESS WORK AVAILABLE. STILL HIGHER WAGES ARE GONNA LEAVE THOSE PEOPLE EVEN MORE VULNERABLE THAN THEY STARTED. AND THIS IS TYPICAL FOR INFLATION THAT SOME PEOPLE WERE HURT WORSE THAN OTHERS- SOME PEOPLE CAN HAVE PRICED THEIR OWN WAGES OF THEIR PRICES THE KEEP UP. UP THIS UNCERTAINTY THIS IMBEDDED WITHIN THEM INFLATION IS A VERY SERIOUS PROBLEM THERE'S ALSO UNCERTAINTY ASSOCIATED WITH THE- WINDING DOWN OF INFLATION AND THAT ESPECIALLY HAS TO DO WITH INTEREST RATES. AND THEN WE CAN TALK LATER IF YOU'D LIKE ABOUT THE SEVERE PROBLEMS WE HAD IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES IN CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURE BUT LET ME JUST CLOSE BY SAYING. AS INTEREST RATES ARE RISING NOW WE A RECOGNIZE HOW CAPITAL INTENSIVE AGRICULTURE IS WHETHER IT'S ALL. THE STATUTE TREES THAT LAST FORTY OR FIFTY YEARS MAJOR CAPITAL INVESTMENT LONG TIME PAY OFF. FARMS BOROUGH MONEY AT. IN THE OVER THE LAST TEN OR FIFTEEN YEARS VERY LOW INTEREST RATES. EASIER TO PAY THAT BACK OVER THE LONG HAUL. NOW WE SEE RISING INTEREST RATES MUCH HIGHER INTEREST COSTS IN THE ONLY MAKES SENSE IF YOU THINK THE OUTPUT PRICES ARE GONNA STAY HIGHER GOAL HIGHER WITH INFLATION. THAT IS TO SAY TO BE ABLE TO PAY OFF THE LOAN WITH INFLATED DOLLARS OF FORM AS TO BE COMFORTABLE AND CONFIDENT THAT THESE PRICES ARE CONTINUE TO GO UP. THIS NAVIGATING THE WINDING DOWN OF INFLATION. THEN RAISES EVEN MORE CONCERNS OR AT LEAST EQUAL CONCERNS AND HAS ITS OWN PROBLEMS AND I THINK AS WE HAVE THE FEDERAL RESERVE AND OTHERS. BEGINNING TO UNRAVEL INFLATION AND INTEREST RATES ARE GOING UP WELL THAT'S A WHOLE SET OF CHALLENGES WE ALL OUGHT TO KEEP OUR EYE ON. IT LET ME STOP THERE PROFESSOR THAT WAS KIND OF A I OPENING JOLT TO SUGGEST THAT. OUR ATTEMPTS TO CONTROL INFLATION WILL END UP- WILL HAVE A SEND UP WITH RISING COSTS FOR FOOD- LONGER LONGER TERM IN THE OUT YEARS BECAUSE OF- THIS INCREASED RATES. SO THANK YOU FOR THAT LET'S- LET'S GO BACK TO BOTH OF YOU TOUCHED ON INFLATION OBVIOUSLY- SINCE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THIS BUT- WHAT WE WANT TO. DEAL WITH IN AND DOCUMENT NIKOLSBURG I WANTED TO ASK YOU WAS HOW DO WE CONTROL NOT CONTROL INFLATION BUT ALLEVIATE INFLATION FOR CALIFORNIANS AND- THIS- IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET THE GOVERNOR HAS PROPOSED WAYS TO PUSH MONEY TO CALIFORNIANS AS A WAY TO. ASSIST THEM WITH RISING COSTS A LOT OF THAT FOCUS HAS BEEN ON THE COST OF GASOLINE WHICH WE'VE TALKED ABOUT TODAY- IT DOESN'T. IT DOESN'T. A FACT EVERY CALIFORNIAN- THE SAME WAY BECAUSE OF THE CURRENT PROPOSALS TO DO IT THROUGH OWNERSHIP OF CARS BUT- I'D LIKE TO TOUCH ON THAT DOCTOR NIKOLSBURG ON ON HOW THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO CALIFORNIANS I ALSO WOULD LIKE TO. ASK YOU TO- TWAY IN ON KIND OF THE BIGGER PICTURE HOW DOES GIVING CASH SUPPORT TO CONSUMERS- AT THE SAME TIME IT HELPING THEM PAY FOR INCREASED COSTS- IMPACT. THAT THE UPWARD PRESSURES ON INFLATION AS WELL THANK YOU DOCTOR NIKOLSBURG. THE USER THERE TWO QUESTIONS THE FIRST IS HOW CAN CALIFORNIA ALLEVIATE. INFLATION FOR CALIFORNIANS MOST OF WHAT HOUSEHOLDS BY IN CALIFORNIA. THAT IS OUR OUR OUR PURCHASE IS PURCHASED IN NATIONAL MARKETS AND THEREFORE THERE'S VERY LITTLE THAT THE STATE CAN DO TO ALLEVIATE. INCREASES IN NATIONAL PRICES THEY'RE VERY FEW THINGS THAT WE HAVE IN CALIFORNIA THAT ARE PURCHASED ONLY IN OUR LOCAL MARKETS ONE OF WHICH OF COURSE IS HOUSING. AND WE KNOW THAT- HOME PRICES HAVE BEEN GOING UP AND THEY THEY SHOULD. INDICATE THAT IN TERMS OF THE GASOLINE PRICES WILL PRICES ARE DETERMINED IN WORLD MARKETS. SO CALIFORNIANS COULD BE SUBSIDIZED IN THEIR PURCHASES OF GASOLINE IT MEANS THAT. WE CALIFORNIANS WILL PURCHASE MORE GASOLINE AND BECAUSE WE HAVE A SPECIFIC BLEND OF GASOLINE. THE FORMER AIR QUALITY REASONS AT THAT MIGHT HAVE SOME IMPACT BUT MY GUESS IS THAT IT'S GOING TO HAVE ONLY MARGINAL IMPACT AND NOT ONE THAT IS REALLY GOING TO BE FELT VERY MUCH BY HOUSEHOLDS. AND I'M SORRY THERE'S A SECOND PART OF THE QUESTION WELL I THINK LASTLY WHILE WE TRY TO LEVY EIGHT THE PRESSURE OF INFLATION ON CALIFORNIANS DOES PUSHING CASTING CALIFORNIANS INCREASE. THE ACTUAL UPPER PRESSURE ON ON PRICES BECAUSE THERE'S MORE DEMAND FOR CONSUMPTION. AND POTENTIALLY EVEN GREATER INFLATION. THERE IS INDEED THAT POSSIBILITY AND IT DEPENDS ON HOW MUCH. THE INCREASED DEMANDS FROM THE TRANSFER OF THE INCOME TO CLIFORNIA HOUSEHOLDS ND IS FELT IN PARTICULAR MARKETS THAT IS HOW FAST CAN SUPPLIERS OF GOODS RESPOND TO THAT INCREASED DEMAND. AND WHAT WE'VE BEEN SEEING BECAUSE OF THE SUPPLY SHORTAGES TODAY IS THE SUPPLIERS CAN'T RESPOND VERY FAST. AND IN SAID THAT TRANSFER OF INCOME- IN TURN RESULTS IN HIGHER PRICES- BUT NOT MUCH ALLEVIATION OF THE IMPACT OF INFLATION ON. INDIVIDUALS BUDGETS. HOWEVER THERE'S A DISTRIBUTIONAL IMPACT AS I SAID IN MY REMARKS AS- CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE LOWER INCOME LESS AFFLUENT CALIFORNIANS SPEND DOUBLE THE PERCENTAGE OF THEIR INCOME ON FOOD THEN THE OTHER CALIFORNIA HOUSEHOLDS. AND IN BECAUSE OF THAT. ONE CAN ALLEVIATE THE IMPACT OF INFLATION ON THESE THE MOST VULNERABLE CALIFORNIANS THROUGH INCOME TRANSFERS. THANK YOU FOR MENTIONING THAT POINT AND SO MUCH ATTENTION HERE IN THE CAPITAL HAS BEEN ON HOW DO WE- GIVE MONEY TO PEOPLE TO DEAL WITH INFLATION AND THE GOVERNOR HAS A PROPOSAL OF A PUSHING THAT OUT TO PEOPLE WHO. OWN A VEHICLE SO- I THINK IT'S PROPOSALS FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS PER VEHICLE OWNED BY AN INDIVIDUAL- BUT WHAT HASN'T BEEN TALKED ABOUT IS HOW DO WE BROADEN THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO ARE ACTUALLY GOING TO BE RECEIVING THIS TYPE OF SUPPORT. AND ONE MENTION OF WHY THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE HAS DECIDED TO PUSH THIS THROUGH OWNERSHIP OF VEHICLES IS BECAUSE THE DMV HAS- A BETTER COMPUTER SYSTEM TO PUSH THESE CHECKS OUR AND IDENTIFY WHO PEOPLE ARE IN THE STATE IN OTHER PARTS OF CALIFORNIA OR OTHER. DEPARTMENTS IN CALIFORNIA STATE AGENCIES- WOOD AND I AM THIS IS- I DON'T MEAN TO GIVE YOU A POP QUIZ ON THIS SO I I'VE I APOLOGIZE BUT WOULD IT BE. MORE EFFECTIVE TO REACH THE PEOPLE THAT YOU HAVE DESCRIBED- LOWER INCOME CALIFORNIANS IS IF WE WERE STILL TO USE THE DMV DISTRIBUTION pA STATE ID. MEANING I SEPARATING THIS FROM VEHICLE OWNERSHIP BUT ANYONE WHO HAS A STATE ID MEANING THAT PERHAPS OTHER PEOPLE ON PEOPLE WITH FEWER RESOURCES I DON'T OWN VEHICLES WOULD ALSO BE BENEFITING FROM. THIS- CHECK DISPERSAL. SO ABSENT THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE VARIOUS SYSTEMS THAT THE STATE HAS. TO IDENTIFY CALIFORNIANS- IT ANOTHER SYSTEM WOULD- PERHAPS BE MORE EFFICACIOUS BECAUSE YOU KNOW LOWER INCOME CALIFORNIANS MIGHT NOT EVEN OWN AN AUTOMOBILE THAT'S RIGHT. AND IT AS WELL TRANSFERRING FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR EACH CAR OWNED DOESN'T RECOGNIZE WHETHER THAT CAR USES ELECTRICITY OR GASOLINE. AND SELL IT IT IS A- VERY BROAD BRUSH WAITED TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM BUT AND THERE'S A LOT OF LEAKAGES FROM THAT AND IT DOESN'T SPECIFICALLY IDENTIFY THOSE WHO ARE MOST HURT BY INFLATION PARTICULARLY AS IT. PERTAINS TO FOOD. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT POINT- SPURRED. MAY I TOSS IN TEN SECONDS I WAS GONNA GIVE YOU A COUPLE QUESTIONS TO DR SOMERSET PLEASE JOIN IN ON THIS QUESTION SPECIFICALLY OF THE CUTS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA OF. ALL DOES ADMINISTERED THE FOOD STAMP PROGRAM FOR USDA. WE ADMINISTER SCHOOL LUNCH PROGRAMS AGAIN FEDERAL PROGRAMS ADMINISTERED BY THE STATE BUT ESPECIALLY THE WOMEN INFANTS AND CHILDREN'S PROGRAM. ALL OF WHICH ARE IDENTIFYING LOW INCOME FAMILIES ELIGIBLE FOR ALL OF FOR BENEFITS ONE COULD TRANSFER INCOME TO PEOPLE UP IN IN IN IN. THERE THE FOCUS IS ON GETTING INCOME TO THE MOST VULNERABLE PEOPLE AS OPPOSED TO PICKING OUT YOUR FAVORITE. HEADLINE PRICE THAT WENT UP LIKE GASOLINE. AND IN TYING THE SUBSIDIES TO THAT BECAUSE IT IT STRIKES ME OUR- THAT SORT OF A OF A NON ENDING AARON THE- A CHASE YOU KNOW SO NEXT MONTH THE HEADLINE SAYS I DON'T KNOW EIGHT PRICES GO UP SO WE TRY TO GET IT TO PEOPLE THAT EAT EGGS. AND THE WEEK AFTER THAT SO EVEN THOUGH INFLATION IS THE OVERALL INCREASE IN PRICES ONE WEEK IT'S ONE PRICE ONE WEEKS IS ANOTHER GASOLINE PRICES SPIKED. ALL UP. IT IN SO WE CHASE GASOLINE PRICES RATHER THAN GO DIRECTLY TO WHAT WE'RE REALLY TALKING ABOUT HERE IS TRYING TO HELP PEOPLE THAT ARE MOST VULNERABLE. SO SOMEBODY THAT OF MAYBE A WONDERFULLY DESERVING PERSON A FAMILY THAT LIVES IN PACIFIC PALISADES AND HAS FOUR CARS. GETS A CHECK FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FOR SIXTEEN HUNDRED BUCKS. THAT GOES INTO SOME SAVINGS ACCOUNT SOMEWHERE ARM. IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE THE WAY WE WANT TO RESPOND TO THESE IS A STATE IT IS. IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE IT'S A- ACHIEVING THE OBJECTIVES THAT MOST PEOPLE WOULD BE TRYING TO ACHIEVE WITH A PROGRAM LIKE THIS. A LOT OF US ARE SCRATCHING OUR HEADS ON THAT ONE THANK YOU DOCTOR SUMNER- IN THANK YOU FOR MATCHING THE PRICE OF EGGS SO. THOSE OF US WHO DO DRIVE OR FOR ON A BUS OR WHOEVER WALKING WE SEE A LOT OF SIGNS ON STREET CORNERS ABOUT THE PRICE OF GAS SO IS VISUALLY IN OUR FACES AND IN OUR MIND THAT WE DON'T HAVE THOSE SIGNS FOR DOZEN EGGS. AND WE YOU KNOW WE DON'T HAVE A STORE CHANGING THE PRICE ONCE A WEEK TWICE A WEEK TO LET US KNOW VARIATION EGG PRICES ARE A GALLON OF MILK- AND PERHAPS MAYBE IF THEY DID THAT WE WOULD BE MORE SENSITIVE TO IT- BUT MY THIRTEEN YEAR OLD DAUGHTER IS MAKING A LOT OF EGGS THESE DAYS IT'S YOU KNOW GOOD ENTRY POINTS INTO COOKING AT HOME. SO SO I HAVE NOTICED AG PRICES AND WE'VE TALKED A LOT ABOUT NATIONAL- PRICE MAKING ON COMMODITY. BUT NOT AS MUCH ABOUT REGIONAL VARIATION SO I LIVE IN THE NORTH BAY IN IN MARIN COUNTY VERY HEALTHY AGRICULTURAL COMMUNITY FOR EGGS AS WELL AS MILK AND OTHER PRODUCTS AND- AND SO THERE'S A LOT OF LOCAL PROVIDERS. IN OUR STORES- FOR THOSE COMMODITIES DO WE SEE MORE LOCAL AT YOU KNOW DOCTOR NICHOLS FOR TALK ABOUT HOUSING PRICES BUT DO WE SEE MORE LOCAL PRICES FOR SOME OF THOSE TYPES OF PRODUCTS OR KNOWS THAT ALSO TIED INTO THESE. THESE NATIONAL PRICES. UP IT IS IN THE CASE OF ACHES ITS THE- INTERESTINGLY YOU KNOW ABOVE PROFESSORS LIKE COMPLICATED THINGS SO THAT WE CAN TRY TO FIGURE HIM OUT SO BUT BUT LET ME JUST SAY ABOUT ACHES A CALIFORNIA IS A BIT OF A SEPARATE MARKET THE AVIAN INFLUENZA NATIONALLY HAS RAISED THE PRICE OF CALIFORNIA ACHES GENERALLY BUT IS YOU KNOW WE'VE NOW IMPLEMENTED THE IT'LL BE A PORTIONS OF A PROP TWELVE WHICH SAID THE EGGS IN CALIFORNIA MUST BE CAGE AT LEAST CAGE FREE. ALL CAGE FREE EGGS COST 50% OR SO. SOMETIMES DOUBLE WHAT CONVENTIONAL EGGS DO. SO IF YOU WERE TO TAKE A QUICK TRIP TO CHICAGO OR OR OR SOMEWHERE ELSE YOU'D FIND EGGS A LOT CHEAPER THAN THEY ARE IN MARIN COUNTY. BUT ALL IT TAKES NATIONALLY ALMOST ALL ACHES NATIONALLY OF SPIKED. WELL BECAUSE OF THIS AVIAN INFLUENZA IT ALSO HAPPENED TO HEAR THE THESE THESE DISEASE ISSUES. WHITE FOR HUMANS THEY COMING GOAL AND INFLUENZA IS A IS A CHICKEN DISEASE IT'S QUITE COMMON AND WHEN IT'S BAD EIGHT PRICES GO UP NATIONALLY. BUT THE OTHER THING ABOUT A CRISIS I- I SHOULD SAY IS LOCALLY PRODUCED EGGS JUST ABOUT ANYWHERE IN THE COUNTRY ARE A LOT MORE EXPENSIVE THAN THE NATIONAL LAKE PRICE. IN THE REASON IS PEOPLE TEND TO PRODUCE SPECIALLY ACHES SO IN MARIN COUNTY YOU WILL HAVE. A NOT JUST CAGE FREE BUT FREE RANGE OR WHAT SOMETIMES WHAT'S CALLED PASTURE RAISED EGGS. OF THEIR- LOTS CONSUMERS LIKE COME. UP BUT BUT THEY'RE STILL ONE OR THE COUNTRY BECAUSE THEY ARE A LOT MORE EXPENSIVE. BUT THEY HAVE UNLIKE SOME LOCAL PRODUCTS THAT CAN BE CHEAPER IN AEGS THEY TEND TO BE MORE EXPENSIVE BECAUSE THERE. ARE VERY MUCH A SPECIALTY PRODUCT. YEAH THAT IS A LOT BETTER TO- AND IF AND IF YOU CAN AFFORD IT THAT'S GREAT YEAH THAT'S A GOOD POINT SO WE- WE'VE SEEN THROUGHOUT THIS ENTIRE PANDEMIC- THE CRIPPLING OF THE SUPPLY CHAIN. AND I'D SAY LIKE THE MOST FAMOUS ONE OF THIS MOMENT WHICH WHICH PROBABLY ISN'T. FACTOR THE INFLATION STORY DOESN'T FACTOR INTO WHAT HAPPENED A BABY FORMULA- I THINK THAT'S A SERIES OF LOTS OF UNFORTUNATE POLICIES AND EVENTS THAT THAT IMPACTED THAT- BUT DO WE DO WE SEE THE IMPACTS OF THE SUPPLY CHAIN ISSUES. ALSO DRIVING UP COSTS BECAUSE OF THE FOURTEENTH THEN THE LACK OF PRODUCTION BECAUSE THE HOARDINGS SUPPRESSED PURCHASE SCENE AND THEN NOW THE DEMAND IS RISING THAT THAT SUPPLY DOESN'T EXIST AND SO THERE IS INCREASED COST. UP THERE THAT'S NOT THAT'S THAT'S NOT A BIG FACTOR I'M SURE THEIR CASES WERE WERE SOMETHING LIKE THAT HAPPENED. UP THE BIGGEST ISSUE FOR US SUPPLY CHAIN DISRUPTIONS AFFECTING CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURE FARMS AND RANCHES HERE HAS BEEN THE PORT DISRUPTIONS IN UP THAT ACTUALLY MAKE FOOD PRICES SLIGHTLY LOWER HERE IN CALIFORNIA IN IN THE U. S. SO OFTEN PRICES I MENTIONED WALNUT PRICES BUT ALMOND PRICES ARE ALSO GOING TO BE A BIT LOWER THAN THEY'D OTHERWISE BE. BECAUSE SHE SHIPPING CONTAINERS HAVE BEEN HARD TO FIND WHICH MEANS EXPORTS ARE DOWN WHICH MEANS THE A BIT MORE OF THOSE ALMONDS OR INTO THE IN THE U. S. MARKET. AND THAT HAS A- AFFECT LOWERING PRICES AND THAT'S TRUE FOR SEVERAL. A PROCESSING TOMATOES AND A FEW OTHER- OF AGRICULTURAL OUTPUTS THAT ARE BETTER OFF. IT HEAVILY EXPORTED. THEY WOULD BE EVEN MORE EXPENSIVE IN CALIFORNIA THAN THE REST OF THE UNITED STATES IF THEY DIDN'T FACE THE PORT DISRUPTIONS. ME IS ALSO FACE SOME OF THOSE SAME PORT DISRUPTIONS AND MEAT PRICES HAVE BEEN ONE OF THE HEADLINES FOR HIGH PRICES FOR A NUMBER OF SUPPLY DISRUPTION REASONS. BUT OF THE PORT ISSUE PROBABLY KEEPS BECAUSE WE EXPORT MEAT FROM THE UNITED STATES PROBABLY KEEPS A MEAT PRICES SOMEWHAT. LOWER THAN THEY WOULD OTHERWISE BE SO THE SUPPLY CHAIN CAN CUT BOTH WAYS FOR CONSUMERS. YOU MENTIONED UP OF BABY FOOD IN IT AND IT'S A CORD OR BETA A MILK UP OF. FORMULA FOR BABIES AND THAT'S A VERY SPECIAL ITEM IS YOU KNOW A SIX YEAR 70% OF THE BABY FORMULA IS PURCHASED THROUGH A GOVERNMENT PROGRAM. OF THE WICK PROGRAM AND IN VERY. IN IN THERE'S A COMPLICATED SYSTEM OF WHO IS ALLOWED TO PRODUCE MILK FOR EACH STATE AND THINGS LIKE THAT AND IT'S- BASICALLY A- SYSTEM THAT SORT OF SEEM PRIMED FOR DISRUPTION IT ANYTIME THERE WAS A SHOCK AND OF COURSE WE HAD A FEW OF THOSE. SO IT'S A PRETTY SPECIALIZED SYSTEM. I WOULD SAY IN IN OTHER AREAS THE SUPPLY CHAIN ARM. HAS BEEN IN- WHAT I LIKE TO SAY IS IF YOU HAVE YOUR SPECIALIZED BRAND OF SOMETHING OF THERE'S A REASONABLE CHANCE IT'S GOING TO BE DELAYED AND YOU MAY YOU MAY MISS OUT. IN THE SAME WITH MANUFACTURE PRODUCTS IF YOU WERE WILLING TO TAKE WHATEVER WAS THERE. YOU'RE PROBABLY ALRIGHT BUT MOST OF US HAVE. SLOUGHED TASTES AND PREFERENCES THAT LIMIT WHAT WE WHAT WE'RE WILLING TO BUY. INTO THE SUPPLY CHAIN GETS INTO THAT. I DON'T SEE THAT IS A MAJOR INFLATION CONTRIBUTOR WHAT IS A MAJOR CONTRACT. INFLATION CONTRIBUTOR AS WE HEARD A FEW MINUTES AGO IS THE PRICE OF FUEL SO FOOD HAS TO BE MOVED AROUND WHETHER IT'S- IN A PICKUP TRUCK TO YOUR FARMERS MARKET OR ON THE TRAIN OUT. YOU KNOW BRINGING MEAT FROM THE MIDWEST IN BOTH OF THOSE USE UEL AND THEY BOTH RAISE THE COST OF FEED OF FOOD AT RETAIL. RELATIVE TO THE PRICE OF. THE COMMODITY AT THE FARM. I WILL THANK YOU VERY MUCH SO DR TERRY NICHOLS BURKE UCLA ANDERSON SCHOOL OF MANAGEMENT AND THEN JUST NOW DR DANIEL SUMNER UC DAVIS SCHOOL OF AGRICULTURE. THANK YOU BOTH SO MUCH FOR PARTICIPATING IN THE PANEL IN THIS HEARING- WE ARE GRATEFUL FOR YOU- CONTRIBUTION TO OUR BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF INFLATION AND ITS IMPACT ON OUR FOOD SYSTEMS. THANK YOU THANK YOU ALL RIGHT WE ARE GOING TO CALL UP PANEL NUMBER TWO AND SOME PEOPLE ARE HERE PHYSICALLY IN SUMMER HERE VIRTUALLY SO I'LL JUST MENTION ALL FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE GOING TO BE JOINING US ON PENALTY WHICH IS IMPACTS OF INFLATION ON FOOD SECURITY ORGANIZATIONS WE HAVE BECKY SILVA OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF FOOD BANKS MEG DAVIDSON OF THE SAN FRANCISCO MARIN MARIN FOOD BANK. BENYAMIN CHAO OF THE CALIFORNIA IMMIGRANT POLICY CENTER AND CHRISTOPHER SANCHEZ OF WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY. SO IF YOU ARE HERE PHYSICALLY COME ON UP AND- VIRTUAL MEMBERS WE WILL- CALLED WE HAVE BECKY OR PARDON ME MS SILVA OR MS DAVIDSON- AVAILABLE NOW ONLINE. GREAT THANK YOU SO MISS SILVA OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF FOOD BANKS- YOU ARE FIRST. EVERYBODY IS CONFIRMING THAT YOU CAN HEAR ME OKAY I CAN HEAR YOU AND I CAN SEE YOU THANK YOU. OKAY RIGHT HI MY NAME IS BECKY SO ABOUT I AM THE DIRECTOR OF GOVERNMENT RELATIONS AT THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF FOOD BANKS THANKS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE IN TODAY'S INFORMATIONAL HEARING. ARE YOU HAPPY REPRESENTS FORTY ONE FOOD BANKS THAT PARTNER WITH OVER FIFTY FIVE HUNDRED AGENCY PARTNERS ACROSS THE STATE I'M IN OUR MISSION IS TO END HUNGER IN CALIFORNIA. UNDER ALARMING HIGH CALIFORNIA'S. SINCE THE BEGINNING OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO SINCE JANUARY FOOD INSECURITY IN CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN RISING STEADILY. THE LATEST DATA SHOWS THAT EIGHT MILLION CALIFORNIANS OR JUST OVER 20% OF OUR POPULATION ARE EXPERIENCING FOOD INSECURITY. WITH REPEAT DISPARITIES FOR BLACK AND LATIN TAX COMMUNITY MEMBERS. THIS IS A DOUBLE THE PRE PANDEMIC LEVELS MORE THAN. TWO YEARS INTO THE PROCESS. SO IT'S NO. THAT A RECENT SURVEY OF WORK MEETINGS FOUND THAT NEARLY HALF OFF. ORDER THAT THEY'RE SERVING BETWEEN DOUBLE TO TRIPLE THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE COMPARED TO TWENTY NINETEEN. FOR EXAMPLE LAST MONTH THE ALAMEDA COUNTY COMMUNITY FOOD BANK REPORTED THAT THEY HAD THE BUSIEST EIGHT DAYS THAT THEY'VE HAD IN A YEAR AND A HALF AT ONE OF THEIR DISTRIBUTION SITES. WE KNOWFROM THE GEAT RECESSION THAT THE CRISIS IN FOOD INSECURITY IN CALIFORNIA IS FAR FROM OVER- IF YOU BANKS ARE ANTICIPATING THAT THEY WILL HAVE TO SUSTAIN CURRENT LEVELS OF DEMAND FOR FOOD FOR YEARS TO COME. AT THE SAME TIME THAT MORE PEOPLE ARE SEEKING FOOD ASSISTANCE WE'RE FACING A DANGEROUS FEDERAL FOOD AND BENEFITS FLAT. WHILE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PROVIDED A REALLY ROBUST INITIAL RESPONSE TO THE COLD AT NINETEEN CRISIS. EXPERIENCED A FEDERAL WHO. LEFT MORE THAN 83% FROM. TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY TWENTY TWO. I WANTED TO SHARE A QUICK QUOTE FROM THE CO CEO OF THE CENTRAL CALIFORNIA FOOD BANK WHICH IS AN FRESNO. AND SHE'S GOT IT HISTORICALLY TEETH OUT PROVIDED THE CENTRAL CALIFORNIA WITH ROUGHLY 25% OF THE FOODS THAT WE DISTRIBUTE IT. BUT THIS YEAR WE WILL LIKE YOU RECEIVED YOU FELT FOOD TOTALING ONLY 15% OF THE TOTAL YOU DISTRIBUTE WE SIMPLY CAN'T. MAKE UP THIS DIFFERENCE ON OUR OWN. SO ON TOP OF DEFINING FEATHER SUPPORT FOR FOOD BANKS PEOPLE WHO RECEIVE CALFRESH OR SNAP. OFF I REALLY AREN'T WILL BE FACED WITH A DRAMATIC REDUCTION IN THEIR FOOD BENEFITS WHEN THE FEDERAL PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY STATUS SUNSET. ON AS EARLY AS MID JULY SO WHEN THIS HAPPENS CALFRESH RECIPIENTS WILL LOSE ON AVERAGE ABOUT EIGHTY TWO DOLLARS PER MONTH. IN EMERGENCY OFTEN. STATEWIDE ABOUT NEED A REDUCTION BY NEARLY HALF A BILLION DOLLARS PER MONTH IN BENEFITS TAKEN FROM THE FOOD ECONOMY. COMPOUNDED BY OF COURSE RECORD SETTING FOOD PRICE INFLATION FROM RELATED SUPPLY. INDEX REPORT HIGHLIGHTS THE GROCERY PRICES HAVE RISEN BY ALMOST 11% IN THE PAST YEAR WHICH IS THE LARGEST TWELVE MONTH INCREASING GROCERY PRICES IN NEARLY FORTY TWO YEARS. TELL FOR EXAMPLE SACRAMENTO FOOD BANK AND FAMILY SERVICES REPORTS THE PRICE THEY ARE PAYING FOR IT DOESN'T HAVE. DOUBLED IN RECENT MONTHS FROM NINETY THREE CENTS PER DOZEN TO TWO DOLLARS AND TWENTY CENTS PER DAY. IN A RECENT SURVEY WE ALSO ASKED HOUSEKEEPING'S ARE COPING WITH THE COST OF FOOD AND FREE INCREASING AND THAT MOST REPORTED THAT THEY HAVE USED A DISPROPORTIONATE SHARE OF THEIR ANNUAL FEE PURCHASE BUDGET ALREADY REJECTING ME. AND THAT THEY- INCREASED FUNDRAISING EFFORTS. SOMETHING WE EVEN HAVE TO OFFER FOOD LESS OFTEN AND HAVE YOU KIND OF HAD TO CLOSE DISTRIBUTION SITE. SO WE'RE IN THE MIDST OF A REALLY DANGEROUS SITUATION WHERE MORE PEOPLE ARE HUNGRY. YOUR BANKS ARE GETTING LESS FEDERAL SUPPORT. INDIVIDUALS WILL HAVE LEFT CALPERS DOLLARS TO SPEND YEAH BUT PROSECUTORS GOING UP SO I JUST CAN'T EMPHASIZE ENOUGH HOW CRITICAL THE SITUATION IS AND HOW DESPERATELY WE NEED A PROPORTIONATE STATE INVESTMENT. ONE OF THE MOST IMPACTFUL IMPROVEMENTS SOLUTIONS THAT SUPPORT FOOD BANKS IS HEALTHY. WHICH PROVIDES STATE FUNDING TO BE BANKS AND I'M AN EMERGENCY FOOD PROVIDERS TO PURCHASE CALIFORNIA GROWN. IT'S A WIN WIN FOR CALIFORNIA ESPECIALLY IN THIS MOMENT THAT THE FOOD ECONOMY IS SO DEEPLY IMPACTED. HOW GOOD IS ALSO INCREDIBLY EFFICIENT. EACH DOLLAR ENABLE STUDENTS TO PROVIDE APPROXIMATELY FIVE MEALS AND HELP YOU TO ALSO ALLOWS FOOD BEING SERVING DIVERSE COMMUNITIES. THE FLEXIBILITY TO BUY FOOD UNIQUELY SUITED FOR THE POPULATIONS THAT THEY SERVE. AND ALLOW THEM TO PURCHASE MORE EXPENSIVE ITEMS LIKE PROTEINS THAT ARE RARE AND YOU DON'T. THIS YEAR WE'RE ASKING GOVERNING ASM AND ALTHOUGH JIM LEADERS TO INCLUDE A HUNDRED TWENTY MILLION FOR THE HEALTHY PROGRAM IN OUR STATE BUDGET. WHICH IS IN LINE WITH THE STATE'S SUPPORT THAT WAS PROVIDED LAST YEAR. WE'RE REALLY GRATEFUL THAT THE GOVERNOR INCLUDED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS A ONE TIME FOR HEALTH FOOD IN HIS JANUARY TENTH BUDGET- BUT WE'RE DISAPPOINTED BUT NO ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS WERE PROPOSED IN HIS NEIGHBORHOOD. WE'RE CALLING ON THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR TO PRIORITIZE FUNDING HELP YOU OUT A HUNDRED AND TWENTY MILLION INCLUDINGSIXTY MILLION ON GOING. TO ENSURE THAT YOU CAN KEEP SERVING THOUSANDS OF COMMUNITY MEMBERS WHO RELY N THEM EVERY DAY. WE'RE SO THANKFUL ASSEMBLY MEMBER WICKS AND SENATOR LAYERED- ARE CHAMPIONING OUR REQUEST THIS YEAR. I'M IN ADDITION TO SUPPORT FOR FOOD BANKS I WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT I REQUEST TO PROVIDE STATE FUNDING FOR OUR RAMPS DOWN APPROACH TO HELP RUSSIAN MERCHANTS THE ALLOTMENTS. SO I'M NOT SURE A MOMENT AGO CALFRESH RECIPIENTS WALL LOSE ABOUT EIGHTY TWO DOLLARS PER PERSON PER MONTH. WHEN YOU CAN REDEVELOPMENT AND- AT A TIME WHEN FOOD DOLLARS ARE ALREADY STRETCHED REALLY. THIN WITH THE COST OF FOOD GOING UP. BUT WE CAN'T LET THE EXTRA. AND PREMATURELY. NOT ONLY DOES CALFRESH SUPPORT PEOPLE IN PURCHASING FOOD AT THEIR OWN CONVENIENCE. BUT IT IS ALSO AN IMPORTANT ECONOMIC STIMULUS. FOR EACH DOLLAR SPENT IT GENERATES A DOLLAR ET AND ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES. AND THINGS TO THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES MAXIMIZING THIS OPPORTUNITY THE CURRENT IMPACT OF EMERGENCY ALLOTMENT ON THE CALIFORNIA ECONOMY IS OVER. EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR MONTHS. SO WE'RE ASKING- BUDGET YEARS YOU JUST HAVE OUR TO HELP MITIGATE THIS ONE. AND LAST WEEK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE CELEBRATE THE TREMENDOUS EXCITEMENT THE PANDEMIC ET PROGRAM AND WE'RE REALLY GRATEFUL TO THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES FOR MAXIMIZING THE OPPORTUNITY TO FEED HUNGRY CHILDREN THROUGH THIS PROGRAM. I DON'T THINK YOU DON'T KNOW PDT IS A PROGRAM THAT WAS AUTHORIZED BY THE FAMILIES FIRST ACT AT THE BEGINNING OF THE PANDEMIC. EITHER WAY TO PROVIDE FEW BENEFITS TO CHILDREN WHO ARE MISSING SCHOOL MEALS BECAUSE SCHOOLS WERE CLOSED. TODAY ALMOST FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IN PANDEMIC. YOU NEED YOU BENEFITS HAVE BEEN SPENT. WE'RE REALLY HOPEFUL THAT THE VITAMINS FIVE MINUTES. AND THE USDA WILL APPROVE CALIFORNIA'S PLAN FOR THE CURRENT SCHOOL YEAR AS WELL. ALL STOP THEIR THANK YOU AGAIN FOR INVITING YOU TO SHARE OUR PERSPECTIVE ON THIS I AM VERY TIMELY AND CRITICAL TOPIC AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU SO MUCH MISS OVER AND I'M GOING TO NEED TO RE ORDER- THE PANEL AS I HAD ANNOUNCED IT- DUE TO A TIME CONSTRAINT FOR A MEMBER OF THE A PARTICIPANT IN THE PANEL A MISTER CHOW FROM THE CALIFORNIA IMMIGRANT POLICY CENTER PLEASE THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR REMINDING THE TIME- SO HI MY NAME IS BENJAMIN CHOW AND POLICY ANALYST AT THE CALIFORNIA IMMIGRANT POLICY CENTER. AND MY A AREA OF EXPERTISE IS TRACKING- FOOD INSECURITY AMONG AFRICAN POPULATIONS IN CALIFORNIA- SO TODAY I WILL HOPE TO DO WHAT I CAN TO ADD TO THE CONVERSATION ABOUT HOW- PRICE INCREASES PARTICULARLY FOR FOOD AND BEVERAGE WHICH IS A BASIC NEEDS FOR ALL OF US- HAVE EXACERBATED AFRICAN POP. I'M AND AS YOU KNOW THE COVERED PANDEMIC IS COMPOUNDED WITH INFLATION TO DRIVE INEQUITABLE OUTCOMES FOR IMMIGRANTS ACROSS CALIFORNIA- SO I'LL START WITH AN ANALYSIS DONE IN JANUARY OF THIS YEAR BY THE PUBLIC POLICY INSTITUTE OF CALIFORNIA. WHERE THEY SURE THAT. THEY FOUND THAT THE PRICES IN THE PACIFIC ARE UP EIGHT POINT TWO PERCENT. A RATE SIMILAR TO THE US OVERALL RATE OF EIGHT POINT FIVE PERCENT- AND THESE INCREASES HAVE BEEN DRIVEN AND FOOD AND BEVERAGE ENERGY AND GASOLINE- THE P. P. I SEE ALSO ESTIMATES THAT THE LOWEST INCOME FAMILIES HAVE EXPERIENCED AN OVERALL PRICE INCREASE OF NINE POINT SIX PERCENT. OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS WHILE HIGHER INCOME FAMILIES HAVE SEEN SOMETHING MORE LIKE EIGHT POINT TWO PERCENT. I AND DOLLAR TERMS. TO PURCHASE THE SAME THINGS THAT THEY BOUGHT IN TWENTY NINETEEN. THE LOWEST FIFTH OF IT IN INCOME BRACKET FAMILIES. WE NEED TO SPEND AN ADDITIONAL THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS PER YEAR SO WE'RE SEEING AN EX AN EXTREME BURDEN ON LOW INCOME FAMILIES AND SO. I'LL BE FOCUSING ON LOW. INCOME IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES- SO CAP C. ALONG OUR FRIENDS NURSE CAL. REESE PARTNERED WITH THE UCLA CENTER FOR HEALTH AND POLICY RESEARCH- TO LOOK AT A STATE SURVEY DATA AND EXAMINE OUR FOOD SECURITY AMONG UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS. AND WHAT WE FOUND WAS THAT MORE THAN TWO IN FIVE OR FORTY FIVE PERCENT. I HAVE REPORTED EXPERIENCING FOOD INSECURITY- IN THE PAST AND IN TWENTY TWENTY. SO FOR REFERENCE THE AVERAGE RATE OF FOOD SECURITY IN CALIFORNIA- USING- USDA DATA FROM TWENTY EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY TWENTY. IS NINE POINT 8% SO THIS RATE IS SEVERELY HIGHER THAN THAN THE NATIONAL DATA THAT WE HAVE AVAILABLE- WE ALSO FOUND THAT RATES OF FOOD INSECURITY ARE ESPECIALLY ACUTE FOR CHILDREN. A 64% OF UNDOCUMENTED CHILDREN ACCORDING TO THIS YOU SEE ONLY STUDY- I REPORTED ARE ARE AFFECTED BY FOOD INSECURITY- AND SO TO ILLUSTRATE HOW THIS. SHOWS UP IN SOMEONE'S LIFE- I WANT TO SHARE AN ANECDOTE FROM A HURLING. SHE IS A MOTHER THAT WE SPOKE TO SHE LIVES IN LINDSAY CALIFORNIA IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. SHE SAYS I'M A MOTHER OF THREE DAUGHTERS REPORT ON THE U. S. MY DAUGHTERS HAD CALFRESH BUT MY HUSBAND AND I WERE NOT ARE NOT ELIGIBLE SO THERE TO MIX THAT IS FAMILY. OF THE LIMITED BENEFITS FROM CONFERENCE WERE NOT ENOUGH TO FEED MY WHOLE FAMILY. AND MANY TIMES WE DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH FOOD. AND DECEMBER TWENTY TWENTY ALL OF US GOT CODED AND LYFT BECAME MORE DIFFICULT. WE COULDN'T WORK IMPAIR BILLS IT WAS VERY PAINFUL TELLING MY DAUGHTER THAT WE DIDN'T HAVE MILK. AND HAVING TO PUT HER TO BED WITHOUT SOME TO EAT. I'M IN RECENTLY I SPOKE TO ANOTHER UNDOCUMENTED MOTHER WHO LIVES IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY. AND ANNOUNCER TO SHARE HER STORY SHE SHE- MADE EVERY EVERY BIG POINT TO. A POINT OUT THE PRICE OF EGGS NO CONVENIENCE BASIC NECESSITY SHE'S NOTICING IN HER COMMUNITY. HAVE RISEN IN PRICE- AND IT'S ADDING ADDITIONAL STRESS AND CONSTRAINTS ON HER FAMILY'S BUDGET- SO- YOU KNOW WHAT I REALLY WANT TO GET ACROSS TODAY'S THAT THIS HARDSHIP AS YOU NO. INFLATION IS GONE IT FOR LOW INCOME FAMILIES IS. EXACERBATING FOOD AND SECURITY BUT IT'S- IT'S A CYCLE OF FOOD INSECURITY AND POVERTY THAT HAS PERSISTED FOR A LOT OF FAMILIES ESPECIALLY IN WORKING FAMILIES- OF. FOR THE UCLA THE UCLA DATA WE FOUND THAT FROM THE YEARS TWENTY ELEVEN TO TWENTY NINETEEN FOOD INSECURITY RATES AMONG US NONCITIZEN ADULTS IN CALIFORNIA. HAVE BEEN RANGING FROM 37% TO FIFTY FOUR PERCENT- AND FOR THE SAME YEARS THE PERCENTAGE OF NONCITIZENS AND HOUSEHOLDS WITH INCOME BELOW THE- FEDERAL POVERTY THRESHOLD. RANGE FROM SO WE BELIEVE THAT THIS HISTORY OF SUSTAIN HARDSHIP DEMONSTRATES THE NEED FOR SYSTEMIC SOLUTIONS- THAT'S THAT DISRUPT THE CYCLE OF POVERTY AND MITIGATE FOOD INSECURITY AND THE LONG TERM- SO I'LL JUST MOVE ON TO WHAT- SOME PROPOSALS THAT WE'D WE'D LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT- FOR THE STATE- TO CONSIDER TO PROVIDE RELIEF TO CALIFORNIANS FACING HARDSHIP. I'M PARTICULARLY LOW INCOME IMMIGRANT POPULATIONS. OF THE FIRST PROPOSAL- BECAUSE DUBBED FOOD FOR ALL IT'S BEING ADVANCED AS SENATE BILL FOR SIXTY FOUR. AUTHORED BY SENATOR MELISSA HER TITLE OF THE CENTRAL VALLEY- AND THERE'S ALSO THERE ALSO BUDGET ASKS BEING LED BY HER TADO AND THEN ASSEMBLY MEMBER SANTIAGO- THE GOAL FOOD FALLS TO AND THE EXCLUSION OF CALIFORNIANS FROM THE CALIFORNIA. FOOD ASSISTANCE PROGRAM OR C. FAB. ON THE BASIS OF THEIR IMMIGRATION STATUS AND SO I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THE ATTENTION I WAS BROUGHT TO CALIFORNIA. AND SNAP AS A WAY TO MITIGATE THE PRESSURES WE'VE SEEN OUR COMMUNITIES HAVE OVER THE PAST COUPLE YEARS. THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF INDIVIDUALS IN CALIFORNIA WHO ARE EXCLUDED FROM CALIFORNIA SHE EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE INCOME ELIGIBLE. THE L. A. O. JUST RELEASED A REPORT. AND THEY DIDN'T ANALYSIS AND THEY ESTIMATE ANYWHERE FROM SIX. INDIVIDUALS ARE CURRENTLY EXCLUDED- AND- IN JANUARY OF THIS YEAR THE GOVERNOR INTRODUCED A PROPOSAL TO MAKE C. FIVE AVAILABLE TO INCOME ELIGIBLE UNDOCUMENTED CALIFORNIANS AGES FIFTY FIVE AND OLDER- BUT PEOPLE BELOW THE AGE OF FIFTY FIVE UNDER THIS PROPOSAL WILL CONTINUE TO BE EXCLUDED AND O THAT'S WHERE. WE AS ADVOCATES ARE CONTINUING TO. I BRING THIS UP WITH WITH OUR ELECTED LEADERS INCLUDING YOU- JUST TO GO OVER THE COST- THAT THE BUDGET PROPOSAL FROM THE GOVERNOR ALLOCATES THIRTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN GENERAL FUND FOR PLANNING PURPOSES- WE EXPECT THE LIVE DATE TO BE IS. IMPLEMENTATION DATE TO BE AS EARLY AS JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY FOUR- AND INCREASED WATER THIRTEEN MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY IN TWENTY TWENTY FIVE- ALSO THE SENATE- PUBLISHED ITS- BUDGET BLUEPRINT AND INCLUDED TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS IN ITS PROPOSAL. FOR FOOD FOR ALL FOR ALL AGES SO THEY WON'T BE ON THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL- AND THAT WOULD FUND A FULL A HALF OF YOUR BENEFITS STARTING JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY FOUR SO WE'RE SEEING SOME STRONG SUPPORT AND THE SENATE- BUT UNFORTUNATELY THE MAY REVISE WE DIDN'T SEE ANY INCREASE IN THE AND THE AGE CATEGORIES FOR FOOD FOR ALL FROM THE GOVERNOR. A DESPITE THIS GROWING URGENCY TO MITIGATE FOOD AND SECURITY AND THE PERSISTING EFFECTS THAT WILL HAVE IN OUR COMMUNITIES- SO WE ARE ASKING OF OUR ELECTED REPRESENTATIVES IN THE ASSEMBLY TO JOIN OUR COLLEAGUES IN THE SENATE. AND PRIORITIZE FOOD FOR ALL FOR ALL AGES SO THAT WE HAVE NO EXCEPTIONS AND EXCLUSIONS. AND OUR FOOD SAFETY THAT- THE OTHER PROPOSAL I WANT TO UPLIFT IS. BEING LED BY OUR FRIENDS AT NURSE CALIFORNIA IT'S S. B. ONE FOUR EIGHT ONE. AUTHORED BY BECKER STEPPED OF FOOD WITH CARE AND IS ALSO A BUDGET PROPOSAL BEING LED BY A WICKS- SO- ALL CHILDREN DESERVE TO BE WELL NOURISHED AND THRIVED- THRIVE BUT UNDERLYING FEDERAL RULES FOR CHILD CARE MEAL PROGRAMS. KEEP MANY CHILDREN FROM ACCESSING A CHRISTIAN AND AFFORDABLE FOOD. AND EVEN BEFORE THE PANDEMIC A FEDERAL RULES AND BEING PERSONS DIDN'T ADEQUATELY ACCOUNT FO THE COST OF LIVING- AND THE COST OF PROVIDING. QUALITY CHILDCARE I INCLUDING NUTRITIOUS MEALS FOR CALIFORNIA- SO WHAT THE SPIKE OF FOOD COSTS ARE DUE TO INFLATION PROVIDERS ARE BEING FORCED TO PAY OUT OF THEIR POCKET. TO PAY FOR HEALTHY MEALS FOR CHILDREN. IN CHILD CARE- DESPITE OFTENTIMES OPERATING ON RAZOR THIN OPERATING BUDGET MARGINS. SO WITH FOOD PRICES RANGING FROM YOU KNOW ELEVATING FROM EIGHT TO TEN PERCENT. HI THERE IS A STRONG NEED FOR ADDITIONAL STATE FUNDING TO ADEQUATELY COMPENSATE PROVIDERS FOR THE MEALS THEY SERVE- THE FOOD WITH CARE PROPOSAL CURRENTLY BEING CONSIDERED- N THE STATE BUDGET PROCESS WOULD ENSURE FUNDING FOR FREE MEALS FOR ALL KIDS IN ADEQUATE REIMBURSEMENT FOR THE PROVIDERS IN NAME IT WOULD ALSO ELIMINATE THE AYE REIMBURSEMENT PAY A PENALTY FOR CHILD CARE MEALS- WHICH ONLY COMPENSATES FAMILY DAY CARE PROVIDERS 475% OF THE MEALS THAT THEY SERVE- THE STATUS OF THIS BUDGET PROPOSAL- THIS JUST THEY'RE CONTINUING TO ADVOCATE AND ADVANCE THE BUDGET REQUEST. FOR A CALL FOOD WITH CARE- AND ASKED THAT IT BE INCLUDED IN THE FINAL STATE BUDGET- SO I'LL JUST CLOSE BY SAYING THAT AS RISING FOOD PRICES EAT AWAY AT THE GROCERY BUDGETS. OF ALL OF US- OUR LEADERS MUST PIVOT TO A STATE RELIEF PACKAGE THAT IS EQUITABLE AND INCLUSIVE IN SPECIFIC- TO THE RANGE OF NEED IN OUR COMMUNITIES- SO CONFESSIONS HE FELT HAVE BEEN ESSENTIAL TO LOW INCOME FAMILIES WEATHERING THE PANDEMIC- AND EVERYONE LIVING IN OUR STATE REGARDLESS OF THEIR STATUS OR AGE WILL BENEFIT FOR YEARS TO COME IF WE- INVEST NOW- IN THE GYM BUDGET. AND SO WE CAN CREDIT CALIFORNIA WHERE EVERYONE HAS A PLATE AT THE DINNER TABLE SUPPOSE THERE AND IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THE PROPOSALS ON I CAN STAY. I THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAO WILL GO BACK TO OUR VIRTUAL PARTICIPANTS- MS DAVIDSON FROM THE SAN FRANCISCO MARIN FOOD BANK. REFERENCE NUMBER MAN COMMITTEE MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME. TODAY EVERY SCHEDULING THIS HEARING. MY NAME IS MARY DAVIDSON AND I AM THE DIRECTOR OF POLICY AND ADVOCACY AT THE SAN FRANCISCO MARIN FOOD BANK. THERE IS CURRENTLY BEGINS THE LARGEST TERRIBLE FOOD PROVIDER IN OUR TO TURN SERVICE AREA AND WE HAVE SEEN AN EXTRAORDINARY JOHN INCLUDES. OUR FOOD ASSISTANCE REQUEST SINCE THE BEGINNING OF HER BACK AND WE ARE CURRENTLY DISTRIBUTING FOOD TO OVER FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND HOUSEHOLDS EVERY SINGLE WEEK. UP FROM THIRTY TWO THOUSAND BEFORE THE PANDEMIC. AND DESPITE REPORTED IMPROVEMENTS IN SOME MACROECONOMIC INDICATORS LIKE REDUCE UNEMPLOYMENT. THE DEMAND ON THE GROUND FOR FREE FOOD IS NOT WHEN. IN FACT VISITS TO OUR ONLINE FOOD LOCATOR TOOL HAVE BEEN TRENDING CONSISTENTLY UPWARD SINCE DECEMBER OF LAST YEAR. AND CALLS TO OUR CALVET APPLICATION HOTLINE ARE UP 20% SINCE THE START OF THIS YEAR. MORE AND MORE PEOPLE ARE TURNING TO THE FOOD BANK EVERY MONTH LOOKING FOR HELP TO MAKE THEIR STRAIN HOUSEHOLD BUDGETS SOMEHOW TIED OUT. I WOULD USE MY TIME HERE TODAY O SHARE THE IMPACT NOT ONLY ON COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS LIKE THE SAN FRANCISCO MARIN FOOD BANK. BUT ON THOSE WE SERVE. LOW INCOME RESIDENTS OF ONE OF THE MOST EXPENSIVE REGIONS IN THE COUNTRY. SIMPLY PUT INFLATION IS HITTING THOSE ON THE LOWEST INCOMES THE HARDEST. AS FAMILIES STRUGGLE OF BALANCING INCREASINGLY HIGH COST OF LIVING. AND RISING FOOD PRICES. PEOPLE IN OUR COMMUNITY ARE HURTING. STILL STRUGGLING FROM THE AFTERMATH OF COATED. IN A SURVEY OF OVER SEVEN THOUSAND OF OUR PROGRAM PARTICIPANTS. 81% OF THEM SAID THEY HAD NOT RECOVERED FINANCIALLY FOR PANDEMIC. FOR THOSE WHO ARE ALREADY LIVING PAYCHECK TO PAYCHECK. A 12% INCREASE IN GROCERY COSTS IS NOT A SMALL JOB. ESPECIALLY WHEN COMBINED WITH RISING GAS PRICES INCREASED COST OF CHILDCARE AND RUNS THAT ARE CLIMBING. THE MAKING REALLY TOUGH CHOICES ABOUT WHERE AND HOW TO CUT BACK OUR PANTRY PARTICIPANTS WHO IS CURRENTLY GRAPPLING WITH THESE STRUGGLES. WHEN ANNA YESTERDAY ACTUALLY AT ONE OF OUR POP UP PANTRIES FOR SHE WAS PICKING UP FOOD FOR HER FAMILY. SHE'S ORIGINALLY FROM UKRAINE AND SHE HAS BEEN A NURSE IN SAN FRANCISCO SINCE NINETEEN NINETY FIVE. HE DIDN'T CARE RECURRENCE IN SECTION EIGHT HOUSING AND BOTH ARE DISABLED. HE SAID THIS ABOUT INFLATION MY PARENTS ONLY GET SOCIAL SECURITY SO I HAVE TO HELP THEM WITH RENT THE RENTER'S GOT RAISED IN SOCIAL SECURITY IS ENOUGH. IS AFFECTING ME TOO BECAUSE I HAVE TO PAY MY OWN RENT MY OWN FOOD THE CAR INSURANCE EVERYTHING IS GOING UP IN PRICE NOW. I WENT TO THE STORE AND THE PRICES ARE CRAZY FOR EGGS ELEVEN DOLLARS. IS REALLY ROUGH. AS YOU WERE FROM BACKES. HER COMMON JUST NOW FOOD BANKS ARE NOT IMMUNE TO THESE CHALLENGES. JUST AS MORE OF OUR NEIGHBORS TURN TO US FOR HELP. WE FACE GLOBAL SUPPLIES FIVE G. Y. CHAIN ISSUES AND INFLATION. IS DRIVING AN UNSUSTAINABLE INCREASE IN OUR BUDGETS. ONE OF THE BIGGEST FOOD DISTRIBUTORS NONPROFIT OR FOR PROFIT IN OUR COUNTIES. WE DISTRIBUTE ONE POINT THREE MILLION POUNDS OF FOOD EVERY SINGLE WEEK. AND UNLIKE CISCO OR SAFE WAY OTHER FOR PROFIT FOOD DISTRIBUTORS. WE DON'T PASS THE COST ONTO OUR CONSUMERS. WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT WE'RE HAVING TO ABSORB THESE HIGH HUGE COST INCREASES AT A RATE. THAT IS COMPLETELY UNSUSTAINABLE. WHAT THIS MEANS IS THAT WE ARE FORCED TO GIVE FAMILIES LESS FOOD. AND FOOD IF YOUR FAMILY'S. COSTS ARE INCREASING DRAMATICALLY FOR FOOD THAT WE HAD ALREADY PLANNED TO PURCHASE. WE'VE HEARD A LOT TODAY ABOUT THE PRICE OF EGGS. AND EGGS ARE STABLE PRO IN BOTH OUR PANTRY AND HOME DELIVERED GROCERY PROGRAM SO WE BUY A TON OF EGGS. BETWEEN MARCH AND APRIL OF THIS YEAR. THE PRICE OF EGGS NEARLY DOUBLED IN ONE WEEK. WE EXPECT THIS TO CONTINUE CROSSING AS AN ADDITIONAL FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS EVERY SINGLE MONTH. AND OVER 60% OF WHAT OUR FOOD INDUSTRIES IS ACTUALLY FRESH PRODUCE REJECTING THE COST PER POUND OF PRODUCE WILL INCREASE BY 11% FOR THE LAST HALF OF THIS FISCAL YEAR. AND AT ONE POINT THREE MILLION POUNDS OF FOOD THAT WE DISTRIBUTE EACH WEEK. IT IS TO BE SHIPPED TO OUR WAREHOUSE AND THEN REDISTRIBUTED TO OUR NETWORK OF THREE HUNDRED FIFTY FOOD PANTRIES THAT REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT IN FUEL. EFFICIENT WE'RE SEEING COSTS. WE'VE ALSO SEEN AS AS MICELLAR MENTIONED A DRAMATIC REDUCTION IN FUNDING FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. THIS FISCAL YEAR WE ONLY RECEIVE TEN MILLION POUNDS OF FOOD COMPARED TO THIRTY TWO MILLION LAST FISCAL YEAR. WE DO NOT SEE RELIEF IN SIGHT. SO WE'RE MAKING ALL OF THIS INTO OUR BUDGETING FOR NEXT FISCAL YEAR. THIS MEANS POTENTIALLY NOT BEING ABLE TO BUY AS MUCH FOOD AS WE DID THIS YEAR OR HAVING TO REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF FOOD EACH FAMILY GOT SINCE THE NEED IS CERTAINLY NOT DECLINING. TO COMBAT THESE CHALLENGES WE HAVE JOINED CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF FOOD BANKS IN LOBBYING THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AS WEL. AS LAWMAKERS IN THE SENATE THE ASSEMBLY TO PRIORITIZE ONE HUNDRED TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR CALIPHATE. IN THE BUDGET NEXT YEAR. ALSO GRANTS FOODBANKS FUNDING TO PURCHASE CALIFORNIA GROWN FOOD SUPPORTING LOCAL PRODUCERS AND COMBATING HUNGER AT THE SAME TIME. WE'RE ALSO STRONG SUPPORTERS OF THE FOOD FOR ALL PROPOSALS THAT BENJAMIN JUST MENTIONED AND THE RAMP DOWN OF CALPERS EMERGENCY ALLOTMENTS. I'D LIKE TO CLOSE MY TIME WITH A QUOTE FROM JUNE WHO IS A MOTHER OF TWO TEENAGERS AND SHE RECENTLY STARTED ATTENDING THE ST PETER'S CHURCH FOOD PANTRY WHICH IS IN THE MISSION NEIGHBORHOOD OF SAN FRANCISCO. SHE SAID IF I WASN'T ABLE TO COME TO THE PANTRY I WILL BE REALLY LIMITED BECAUSE EVERYTHING IS REALLY EXPENSIVE EVEN AN ONION IF I GO TO THE STORE. EVERYTHING HAS A HIGHER PRICE NOW. SO IT WOULD REALLY BE A STRUGGLE FOR ME TO EAT. IF I WAS NOT ABLE TO COME HERE. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISS DAVID SEN AND NEXT WILL HAVE MISTER CHRISTOPHER SANCHEZ FROM THE RESTAURANT ENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY MISTER SANCHEZ. AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME CHRISTOPHER SCIENCES POLICY ADVOCATE THE WESTERN CINEMA POVERTY WE WANT TO SAY THAT WE APPRECIATE THE INVITATION TO BE HERE TODAY DISCUSSES IMPORTANT ISSUES. AND SURE WE'VE BEEN HEARING FROM OUR LEGAL PARTNERS IN THE LEGAL SERVICE COMMUNITY AND CBO DIRECTLY SERVING CALIFORNIANS I WANT TO ECHO MANY OF THE COMMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE BY MY FELLOW PANELISTS- AND REALLY TALK ABOUT ISSUES RELATING TO ACCESS AND THE DELIVERY OF- BENEFITS WHETHER BE- CAL FRESH KERR WORKS OR OTHER. SAFETY NET PROGRAMS ARE HERE IN CALIFORNIA. AS IT RELATES TO COMMUNITIES WE SERVE WE KNOW THAT MANY COMMITTEE MEMBERS ARE PRESENT ARE STILL STRUGGLING TO RECOVER FROM THE PANDEMIC AND YET HAVE HAVE HAVE YET TO BECOME STABLE OR- BE WHOLE AGAIN. ONCE WHERE THEY WERE BEFORE- AND THIS IS EVEN MORE SO TRUE FOR CALIFORNIANS ARE UNABLE TO ACCESS FORMS OF FINANCIAL RELIEF THAT WERE OFFERED IN THE MEANT PANDEMIC INCLUDING IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES ON HOUSE INDIVIDUALS. THAT'S WHY WE BELIEVE IT'S CRITICAL THAT WE FIND WAYS PRIORITIZE THE CONNECTION OF BENEFITS TO PEOPLE WHO AND THE DELIVERY OF THOSE BENEFITS WE'VE HEARD WE HAVE HEARD FROM OUR PARTNERS THAT. ARE SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THAT SOME OF OUR CLIENTS HAVE HAD COME ACROSS I AM TRYING TO ACCESS THE BENEFITS ARE INCLUDING. NOT BEING ABLE TO CONNECT THE CUSTOMER SERVICE PHONE LINES AT A COUNTY SOCIAL SERVICE OFFICE AND SOME COUNTIES WITH INFRASTRUCTURE FOR CUSTOMER SERVICE LINE WASN'T ABLE TO MEET THE DEMAND. WHILE COUNTY SOCIAL SERVICE OFFICE HAS FOUND UNIQUE WAYS SUCH AS TEXT MESSAGING AND SOME COUNTIES TO COMMUNICATE WITH RECIPIENTS REALLY WE BELIEVE THAT COMMUNICATION CAN IMPROVE AND GET BETTER SERVE COMMUNITIES. ON HOUSE INDIVIDUALS HAVE A HARDER TIME RECEIVING A DEBIT CARD AND OTHER IMPORTANT INFORMATION ACCESS SAFETY NET ENEFITS SUCH AS CALFRESH- WHEN THE REQUEST OTHER BENEFITS TO BE SENT TO POST OFFICES IN CALIFORNIA. LET'S POST OFFICES NO LONGER PRIORITIZE THE GENERAL DELIVERY SERVICE. WHICH IS ALLOWED FOR THOSE WHO ARE WE DON'T HAVE A STABLE ADDRESS TO RECEIVE NOW THIS WILL. HAS MADE IT DIFFICULT WHO RELY ON ITS- THE- TO YOU TO ACCESS THE BETTER. AND THAT IF THEY CAN'T PHYSICALLY GET THEIR CARDS. RECIPIENTS OF BENEFITS BEING TARGETED. RECIPIENTS OF BENEFITS SUCH AS CALFRESH HAVE BEEN TARGETED BY SCAMMERS ARE OF SKIMMING RECENTLY- TO ELECTRONIC WE STILL THEIR BENEFITS ON THE DEBIT CARDS- THROUGH A NUMBER OF MEANS- AND UNFORTUNATELY THE SOUND ISN'T SPECIFIC TO CALIFORNIA OUR PARTNERS FROM ACROSS THE COUNTRY. HAVE YOU GONNA SEE AN INCREASE IN THEFT. OF THE SAFETY NET BENEFITS. MESSENE CONTINUED TO BE A GROWING PROBLEM WELL YOU SEEN HERE IN CALIFORNIA IS A COMMON OCCURRENCE IS AN INDIVIDUAL. WILL HAVE THEIR FOOD BENEFIT. POSKIM JUST ENOUGH TO THE CARE RECOGNIZE IT BUT THIS WILL OCCUR OVER TIME- AND THIS WILL GO A NOTICEABLE OUR ARMED FOR ARE QUITE A FEW MONTHS UNTIL. THEY ACTUALLY LOOK INTO HOW MUCH THAT HAS BEEN STOLEN FROM THEM. I DO WANNA MENTION AND APPLIED CDSS ON THEIR MOVE TO PROVIDE NEW DEBIT CARDS CHIU CALFRESH RECIPIENTS. TO PREVENT THE SCAMMING OUGHT TO ENSURE THAT THOSE CHIPS ON THESE CARDS THAT WOULD BE SIGNIFICANT FOR SCAMS THAT OCCUR THE CARD READERS. ARE WHICH IS CURRENT WHICH IS HAPPENING RIGHT NOW. WE BELIEVE THAT THESE CHARGES ARE IMPORTANT TO KNOW AS RELATES TO INFLATION AT IS CRITICAL THE STATE ENSURES. THAT THOSE WHO QUALIFY TO ACCESS BENEFITS ACTUALLY ABLE TO ACCESS ND UTILIZE THESE BENEFITS. AND ENSURE THAT WE CAN KEEP THEM ARE SECURE. SO FAMILIES. CAN BE ABLE TO MEET THEIR BASIC NEEDS AS RELATES MORE SPECIFICALLY TO INFLATION WE WANT IT WE JOIN MANY A LOT OF THE KIDS THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS HEARD FROM. A AN AXE FOR GREATER INVESTMENTS IN THE STATE'S BUDGET AND TARGET DOLLARS TO COMMUNITIES ARE EXPERIENCING POVERTY. QUESTIONS CENTERS BOYS SUPPORTER PROPOSALS THAT WOULD STRENGTHEN THE STATE'S A SAFETY NE REGARDLESS OF IMMIGRATION STATUS ARE THEIR AGE. WE WOULD PER- WE WOULD PROVIDE ADDITION WE WOULD ASK THAT ADDITIONAL DOLLARS. BE TARGETED TO EXISTING PROGRAMS ARE SUCH AS CAL WORKS ARE CARYATIDS. WE WOULD ENCOURAGE OF LEGISLATURE WHEN THE PROVIDING ADDITIONAL FORMS OF RELIEF. THAT THEY INCLUDE GENERAL ASSISTANCE RECIPIENTS MANY OF THEM WERE ON HOUSE. UNFORTUNATELY LAST YEAR'S GOLDEN STATE STEM THIS GRANT DID NOT REACH THESE INDIVIDUALS. WHO ARE REALLY VULNERABLE- AND CONTINUE TO CONTINUE TO BE LEFT OUT OF MANY FORMS REALLY. AS WE RECOGNIZE THE GRIDLOCK THAT'S HAPPENING IN DC EVEN ON PROPOSALS THAT WOULD ASSIST FAMILIES IN NEED. IT'S REALLY UP TO THE STATE THE STATE LEGISLATURE TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL SYSTEMS TO. TO MOVE CALIFORNIANS OUT OF POVERTY THANK YOU MISTER. CHAIRMAN HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISS SANCHEZ- FIVE STAR OPENING THIS UP FOR THE PANEL AND- AND THIS IS BEEN CERTAINLY A VERY BIG TOPIC FOR- FOR IN THE NEWS IN JUST THE PAST WEEK OR SO AND WAS ALLUDED TO IN IN THE FIRST PANEL ABOUT BABY FORMULA. AND WHETHER FAMILIES THAT ARE ASSISTED BY OUR FOOD BANKS- HAVE BEEN SEEKING- MORE ASSISTANCE AND THE FOOD BANKS HAVE SEEN A CHALLENGE IN GETTING ACCESS TO THOSE RESOURCES I'M A FEW YEARS REMOVED FROM- BUYING BABY FORMULA SO I HAVEN'T LOOKED AT THE SHELVES TO SEE THAT PERSONALLY SO I'D BE GLAD IT LEARN A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THAT. SURE I CAN I CAN SURE FIRST AND THEN BACK YOU CAN SHARE MORE STATEWIDE- PERSPECTIVE. IN SERVICES GOING MARIN WE DEFINITELY HAVE SEEN AN INCREASED DEMAND FOR BABY FOOD IT ISN'T ACTUALLY A FOOD PRODUCT THAT WE SOURCE PROACTIVELY. SO WE TYPICALLY DON'T HAVE ANY- IN OUR WAREHOUSE UNLESS IT'S BEEN DONATED TO US AND THEN WE OFTEN- REDISTRIBUTE TO ORGANIZATIONS LIKE THE HOMELESS PRENATAL PROGRAM. OR OTHER ORGANIZATIONS THAT WE KNOW SERVE THAT POPULATION DIRECTLY. BUT WE HAVE BEEN HEARING IT QUITE A BIT ON THE GROUND AT OUR PANTRIES A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE ARE NOW COMING TO US ASKING FOR IT. SO IT IS DEFINITELY A HUGE A HUGE DEMAND- AND WE DON'T HAVE THE- THE SUPPLY ON HAND TO MEET IT. THANK YOU MISS DAVISON MISSILE DID YOU WANT TO ADD ANYTHING TO THEM. SURE I CAN HANDLE THAT THANK YOU FOR RAISING THIS QUESTION OBVIOUSLY IT'S TOP OF MIND FOR. MANY OF US AND IT REALLY CRITICAL URGENT REALLY HEARTBREAKING SITUATION THAT WE'RE SEEING ALL THE- WE'RE MONITORING IT AS WELL WE ARE I'M- IN THE PROCESS OF TRYING TO HEAR FROM FOOD BANKS ABOUT WHAT THEIR EXPERIENCES AROUND US AND I'M GLAD THAT. I'M IS DAVIDSON WAS ABLE TO ON YOUR FOR EXAMPLE FRIENDS ARE DISCOVERING LEVINE- THERE ARE VERY FEW FEW OUT THAT JUST. BABY FOR I THINK MOSTLY BECAUSE I YEAR I'M VERY STRICT- REGULATIONS AND PROTOCOLS AROUND- YOU KNOW HOW LONG YOU CAN BE ON THE SHUTTLE AND HOW IT SHOULD BE STORED AND THINGS LIKE. THAT WE ARE LEANING ON AND LEARNING FROM THE CALIFORNIA WEEK ASSOCIATION IN TERMS OF OPTIONS THAT WE CAN TAKE AND THINGS THAT WE CAN DO AS A STATE TECHNICAL MEDIATE THIS PRESSURE- SO AGAIN JUST REALLY APPRECIATE YOU RAISING THIS CONCERN IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'RE MONITORING AS WELL- AND WILL BE. WORKING WITH OUR PARTNERS TO TRY AND MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE ELEVATING ANY SOLUTIONS THAT WE THANK YOU GOD. I'M SURE STATE PARTNERS- SO THAT WE CAN ALL MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN THIS SPACE SO THANKS FOR THE QUESTION YEAH I THINK I REMEMBER THE BABY FORMULAS IT C. FEELS QUITE PRICEY- AND I REMEMBER THAT- IT'S BEEN YEAH AGAIN A DECADE PLUS SINCE I HAD. TO BUY IT FOR MY KIDS BUT- YOU KNOW NOURISHMENT OF ONE'S CHILDREN IS JUST A TOP OF MIND FOR ANY PARENT. YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THEY'RE FED SUIT SO AN INFANT CAN SLEEP THROUGH THE NIGHT YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE FED SO THEY CAN GROW- THEY HAVE THE PROPER NUTRIENTS FOR THEIR BRAINS DEVELOPMENT- AND SO TO- TO NOT BE AWARE TO NOT HAVE US. OUR TENSION CALL TO THIS IS POLICYMAKERS- TO IT TO I FEEL LIKE WE'RE KIND OF LATE IN THE GAME TO MAKE SURE THAT PARENTS WHO CARE ABOUT THIS HAVE THE RESOURCES NECESSARY TO GET. THE FORMULA. THAT THEIR CHILDREN NEED- IT- IT'S JUST A- FOR US TO COMMUNITY AN EYE ON THE SPEAK- THAT'S A LOT OF FIVE THERE'S A LOT OF RISK. I'LL JUST LEAVE IT AT HAT- SO THANK YOU- NO HOW HAS THE- WITH KIND OF. THE MULTIPLE CRISES THAT WE HAVE FACED- THAT THE PANDEMIC AND NOW THESE INFLATIONARY PRESSURES BOTH WERE- DIFFERENT IN THE WAY THAT THEY AFFECTED. THOSE ABILITY TO GET FOOD BUT A LOT OF IT WAS FINANCIAL BECAUSE THE PEOPLE WHO WHO ARE LOWEST INCOME OFTEN WERE THE ONES MOST IMPACTED BY THE PANDEMIC AND THE PANDEMIC RECESSION THAT HIT THEIR FAMILIES BUT BUT DIDN'T HIT THE STATE'S BUDGET- BUT YET THE RESOURCES- MAYBE HAVEN'T FLOWED. ADEQUATELY TO IT TO SUSTAIN THE ATTENTION THAT NEEDS TO BE ON THOSE FAMILIES AS AS WE'VE ATTEMPTED TO BRING. EVERYONE ALONG ON ON THAT RECOVERY- YOU KNOW HOW HOW HAVE YOU. LEARNED OR ADAPTED TO MEET THOSE NEEDS OF FAMILIES WHO HAVE BEEN IMPACTED BY BOTH INFLATION AND THE PANDEMIC HOW THEY CHANGED ARE THEY THE SAME THROUGHOUT BOTH. I KNOW THE PANDEMIC'S NOT OVER. AND ANYONE CAN JUMP IN. I CAN OFFER JUST KIND OF A BROAD I'M OVERVIEW OF WHAT WE'RE LEARNING AND HEARING FROM ALLEN FEEDBACK THE CROSSES STATE FARRELL. I DO IT I'M BIG PICTURE I WOULD SEE THAT FEW BEINGS HAVE. REALLY ADOPTED AND CHANGED AND SHIFTED THE WAY THAT THEY OPERATE SO YOU KNOW YOU BANKS. THROUGH THE HEIGHT OF THE PANDEMIC EARLY ON WERE HAVING TO SCRAMBLE TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT OKAY WITH ALL THESE. SOCIAL DISTANCING GUIDELINES WHAT DOES THAT MEAN FOR THE WAY OF THAT OUR PROGRAMS OPERATE AND YOU KNOW I THINK YOU PROBABLY SAW IT IN THE NEWS AND THERE ARE MANY VIDEO- THINGS DOING DISTRIBUTION SITES WHERE PEOPLE WOULD DRIVE UP IN THEIR CAR IN ORDER TO AVOID. ARE WE- TOO YOU KNOW WE PEOPLE YOU KNOW YEAH YOU KNOW SPACE BECAUSE I THAT- WE READ HEARD A STORY. MUD- BUT I THINK PARTNER. ABOUT SEEING KEEP. WALK SO THERE A FEW THREE FIVE AS A TO DRAW. BECAUSE FAMILIES ARE TO. THE GAS THE CAR IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO THEIR JOBS- AND SO YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN CONTINUOUSLY HUMBLED THROUGH THIS ENTIRE PANDEMIC. AND NOW THROUGH THIS. INFLATION'S ABOUT HOW YOU BEING JUST KEEP A YOU KNOW ANY THE NEXT CHALLENGE THE THRONE AT THEM THAT THEY THINK OF ANOTHER WAY TO TRY AND ADOPT AND CHANGE TO MEET THE SITUATION THAT THEY'RE IN TODAY SO I KNOW MAKING SPEECH ABOUT FROM THE BEGINNING RESPECTIVOS WELL THAT'S KIND OF AN OVERVIEW. BUT I WOULD GIVE STATEWIDE. I'M IF YEAH MISTER SUCH AS GO AHEAD YOUR HONOR IF I MAY I THINK ONE THING THAT WE'VE SEEN IS THAT- WHEN IT COMES TO INFRASTRUCTURE AND DELIVERING OF BENEFITS- CALIFORNIA DOES NEED TO IMPROVE OUR- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE SEE WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO REALLY RESPOND DURING THE PAST. HOW DO WE GET MONEY AND HANDS OUTING A MILLION HANDS RIGHT AWAY WERE FORTUNATE WHEN IT CAME TO. TWO CHILDREN AND SCHOOLS WERE ABLE TO MOVE VERY SWIFTLY. BUT I THINK THERE ARE CERTAIN COMMUNITIES THAT THE STATE. NEEDS TO REALLY THINK LONG TERM AS- STE MORE SPECIFIC TO THE IMMIGRANT COMMUNITY- WHO THE INFRASTRUCTURE WASN'T NECESSARILY THERE- AND THEN AS AS A RELATES TO FOLKS WHO ARE OR ARE. CURRENTLY STILL- THROUGH GOING TO THE PANDEMIC AND TRENT TRYING TO RECOVER. I THINK WE SING WITH IT WITH- SOMETIMES ON POVERTY. WHEN UNFORTUNATELY OUR LOVED ONE WHO- WAS THE BREADWINNER OF THE FAMILY HAVE PASSED AWAY. I HAS HAD A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT WHERE THE- THE INDIVIDUALS ARE. YOU KNOW MAY HAVE NOT WORKED IN THE IN PREVIOUS YEARS AND ARE BECOMING THE BREADWINNERS OF THE CHILDREN OF. OF THE FAMILIES WHO ARE IN THEIR EARLY TEENS OR EARLY TWENTIES. ARE ARE NOW BECOMING THE BREADWINNERS WE KNOW THAT MORE SPECIFICALLY. FOR UNDOCUMENTED FAMILIES IF THERE WAS ONE PERSON WHO HAD A SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER. THEY AUTOMATICALLY BECAME LAW- THE BREADWINNER AND SALT. THIS CONTINUES TO BE. A THEME THAT WE'VE SEEN. FROM AND SO DO WE- CREATE A SAFETY NET THAT CAPTURES A- EITHER SEVERAL. AND I JUST THAT THAT WOULD DO THAT- INCLUDING A SAFETY NET PROGRAM AWAITING- PROVIDE FOR UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS FOR A DOCUMENT FOR. THANK YOU MISTER SANCHEZ- I DON'T WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAUGHT EVERYONE WHO WANTED TO PARTICIPATE IN THAT QUESTION AND IF WE HAVE. I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU- TO MS SILVA- TO MISS DAVIDSON MR SANCHEZ AND MR CHOW. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR PURCHASING THIS PANEL ON IMPACTS OF INFLATION. ON FOOD SECURITY ORGANIZATIONS I'M GRATEFUL FOR YOUR CONTRIBUTION THIS CONVERSATION. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HAVING US. THANK YOU YOU ARE WELCOME THANK YOU AGAIN HI I WE WILL BRING UP OUR THIRD PANEL. PANEL THREE. IMPACTS OF INFLATION ON FOOD GROWERS PRODUCERS AND WORKERS WE HAVE A LOT TO SEE A GARCIA FOR THE CALIFORNIA GROCERS ASSOCIATION JIM HOUSTON FROM THE CALIFORNIA FARM BUREAU- JAZZY GRUEL FROM THE UNITED FOOD AND COMMERCIAL WORKERS. AND I BELIEVE WE HAVE SOMEONE WHO'S HERE VIRTUALLY AND THAT IS. NICOLE RICE COACH KNOWS THAT IS- THAT IS THE REPLACE GOT IT OKAY. THE WHOLE RACES IS VIRTUALLY HERE GOT IT OKAY SO WE WILL BEGIN WITH MS GARCIA THANK YOU HI I'M NOT MYSTERIES. I'M KELLY ASH I'M WITH THE CALIFORNIA GROCERS ASSOCIATION WE GOT A COUPLE OF SUBSTITUTION STATUS UPS IS THE ABSENCE OF THE TWO SHINS BUT THANK YOU VERY MUCH CHAIR FOR. BRINGING THIS CONVERSATION TOGETHER WE REALLY APPRECIATE IT BECAUSE YOU KNOW- THE GROCERYINDUSTRY REALLY DOES CARE ABOUT- OUR COMMUNITY AND MAKING SURE THAT PEOPLE ARE FED- AND THERE'S A LOT OF STRAIN SYSTEM RIGHT NOW. SO I WANTED TO START WITH JUST SAYING YOU KNOW ANY KNOWLEDGE IN THAT YOU KNOW INFLATION IS VERY MUCH UP. I THINK WE ALL WE ALL KNOW WHY THAT'S WERE HERE- IN MARCH TWENTY TWENTY TWO. INFLATION REACH LEVELS SEEN IN FOUR YEARS NOT JUST. THE FOOD SYSTEMS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE TODAY- BUT WHEN WE ARE LOOKING AT INFLATION- YOU KNOW US AT C. G. A. N. AS GROCERS IN THE GROCERY INDUSTRY. WE REFERENCE THE BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS. PRODUCER PRICE INDEX NOT JUST THE CONSUMER PRICE INDEX BECAUSE THE PRODUCER PRICE INDEX REALLY TALKS ABOUT. WHAT IT COSTS TO MAKE AND MOVE GOODS- AND SO AS YOU KNOW AS A RETAILER THAT'S WHAT WE LOOK AT- WE REVIEWED THE MOST RECENT P. P. I. NUMBERS- IN PARTNERSHIP WITH CAL POLY SAN LUIS OBISPO THEIR DEPARTMENT OF AGRIBUSINESS- I'M AN OVERALL THAT PP I INFLATION NUMBER IS ELEVEN POINT 2% TO GIVE YOU CONTEXT AROUND THAT- I'M SURE YOU ALREADY KNOW BUT- THE CONSUMER PRICE INDEX IS AT EIGHT POINT FIVE PERCENT. AS OF MARCH AND THAT'S THE LATEST NUMBER WE HAVE ON THAT SO THERE IS A BIG DISPARITY THERE IN WHAT IT'S COSTING TO MAKE GOODS AND TO BRING. PRODUCTS TO MARKET- YOU KNOW IS I KNOW SOME OTHER FOLKS OF STE TOUCHED ON EARLIER ANOTHER PANELS BUT- GAS GAS PRICES ARE UP WATERS UP ENERGY INGREDIENTS PACKAGING AND TRANSPORTATION EVERYTHING. EVERY STOP ON THE SUPPLY CHAIN IN ORDER TO GET FOOD TO- A CALIFORNIA. IS UP. AND SO WHEN WE'RE OPERATING AS RETAILERS ON RAZOR THIN MARGINS. YOU KNOW THOSE COSTS ARE NATURALLY GOING TO GO UP AND IN FACT SOME OF OUR MEMBERS HAVE EVEN GONE OUT SO FAR IS TO EAT. SOME OF THESE INCREASES ON STAPLE ITEMS LIKE BREAD- MILK AND EGGS. WHICH I KNOW IT HAS BEEN A BIG CONVERSATION HERE TODAY AND YEAH THERE ARE A LOT OF PARTS OF THAT THAT ARE IN- SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER- BUT A LOT OF THEM ARE. EATING FRANKLY THOSE THOSE INCREASES IN COSTS- AND- AND DOING WHAT THEY CAN FOR CALIFORNIANS- ACCORDING. TO THE BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS P. PI THIRTY ONE POINT 9% ENERGY IS UP THIRTY FIVE POINT 7% PACKAGING IS UP 23% PROCESSING IS UP 33%% AND TRANSPORTATION IS UP TWENTY POINT 2% SO THESE ARE REALLY REALLY LARGE NUMBERS IN THE SPECIFIC SECTORS ANY STOPS ALONG THE SUPPLY CHAIN- WE HAPPEN TO BE THE CULMINATION OF WHERE ALL OF THAT STUFF MEETS. ANDWHERE THE CONSUMER SEES THE PRICE TAG DEFINITELY ARE- INTERVAL PARTS OF THEIR COMMUNITIES AND WANT TO SERVE THEM- WE'VE BEEN FEELING IT RIGHT ALONG WITH OUR CONSUMERS AND OUR YOU KNOW OUR KIND NEIGHBORS. YOU KNOW INFLATION THAT WERE SEEN THOUGH IT'S NOT UNIQUE TO CALIFORNIA IT'S NOT UNIQUE TO THE FOOD SYSTEM INDUSTRY- SO AS WERE AS WE'RE LOOKING AT THIS. YOU KNOW THERE'S NOT REALLY ONE SPECIFIC THING WE CAN POINT TO AS TO WHY. SOMETHING MAY BE HIGHER PRICED OR WHY INFLATION IS UP IN ONE SPECIFIC SPOT LIKE THE YOU KNOW PROFESSORS HAS SPOKE TO EARLIER. THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT REASONS- CULMINATING ALTOGETHER FOR INSTANCE EGGS AVIAN FLU HAPPENS TO BE A PIECE OF THAT PUZZLE. ON THE IMPLICATE- THE IMPLEMENTATION OF PROP TWELVE AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS YEAR ON THE A PORTION OF IT AT LEAST. YOU KNOW THOSE ARE THOSE ARE- ALL LITTLE PIECES THAT PLAY INTO THE LARGER PUZZLE- YOU KNOW WE FEEL. WE'RE FEELING THIS WORLDWIDE AND MULTI INDUSTRY INFLATION RIGHT ALONG WITH EVERYONE ELSE- AND WE'VE BEEN DOING WHAT WE CAN TO MITIGATE THAT ERE POSSIBLE- WE ARE VERY SUPPORTIVE OF A LOT OF THE EFFORTS THAT WERE MENTIONED IN THE LAST PANEL- IN FACT WE- ARE. PARTNERING WITH. A COUPLE OF OTHER GROUPS INCLUDING SPUR. ON SPONSORING AB TWENTY ONE FIFTY THREE BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER ARAMBULA. IT LOOKS TO EXPAND WHAT WAS A PILOT PROGRAM ON INCREASING- DOLLARS TO. SNAP PARTICIPANTS IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO GET MORE FRESH FRUITS AND VEGETABLES- AND THAT COULD LOOK LIKE AS MUCH AS SIXTY DOLLARS- SIXTY TWO DOLLARS A MONTH. AND THERE'S ALSO APPEARED BUDGET ASK WITH THAT THAT WE- HAVE BEEN ASKING THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE TO SUPPORT WHICH IS TO THE TUNE OF TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS- THAT WE THINK COULD GO REALLY LONG WAY TO HELPING SUPPORT. BOWL IN GETTING- BETTER ACCESS TO FRESHER FOODS. SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU MS ON AVERAGE- WE NEXT HAVE- JIM HOUSTON FOR THE CALIFORNIA FARM BUREAU THANK YOU MR LEVINE. KIND OF FUNNY ANECDOTE I THINK THIS KIND OF TYPIFIES WHERE WE'RE STANDING THIS IS DECEMBER- THIS PAST YEAR. MY MOM IS COMING. UP AND SHE REALLY LIKES RECS AND SO- I WAS GONNA MAKE RIBS AND I YOU KNOW I. SMOKED RIBS YOU KNOW WITH QUITE FREQUENTLY EITHER GENERALLY THREE NINETY NINE A POUND. I WENT TO THE STORE IS NOT GONNA FLOOR IN IN DECEMBER AND THEY WERE NINE NINETY NINE A POUND. AND I WENT TO THE CHECKER- BECAUSE UNITED HAVE A DAD SO I YOU KNOW TOLD CORNY DAD JOKES AND DO THINK SUPER SPY KIDS AND SO I SAID TO THIS PERSON IS YOU KNOW. TWENTY OR WHATEVER I SAID HEY YOU KNOW I'VE SPENT MY ADULT CAREER TRYING TO PREVENT THE GOVERNMENT FROM BREAKING THE FOOD SYSTEM AND CLEARLY I AFFECT. ITSELF YARDS IN HOUSTON WITH CALIFORNIA FARM BUREAU I AM THE ADMINISTRATOR OF THE CALIFORNIA FARM BUREAU. AND I HAVE I SPENT TWENTY TWO YEARS- IN THIS TOWN- WORKING- IN AG POLICY ABOUT MY START WITH THIS MONTH SALINAS. I'VE WORKED I WORKED UNDER JERRY BROWN AS UNDERSECRETARY CDFA- SO I HAVE SOME PERSPECTIVE- BUT- AS AS YOU MAY KNOW I'M SURE YOU KNOW MR LEVINE- BUT BUT OTHERS WATCHING MAY NOT CALIFORNIA FARM BUREAU. IS COMPRISED OF TWENTY TWO THOUSAND FARMS AND RANCHES ACROSS THE STATE. AND 80% OF THOSE FARMS BY THE WAY OUR SMALL FARMS. THE BIG EYED AT GFI I'M IN CALIFORNIA ANOTHER SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND. PLUS ANOTHER EIGHT THOUSAND SUPPORTING BUSINESSES MANY OF WHOM YOU HAVE HEARD. ABOUT IT FROM HERE- ARE THESE BUSINESSES SPAN FIFTY SIX OF THE FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES IN CALIFORNIA. WE DO NOT HAVE A FARM BUREAU IN SAN FRANCISCO WHICH PROBABLY MAKES SENSE A LOT OF FARM GROUND THERE- THAT ALPINE IS BASICALLY- BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. SO WE DON'T HAVE A FARM BUREAU THERE BUT WE DO WE SPAN BASICALLY THE ENTIRE STATE AND WE EXPAND EVERY COMMODITY THAT IS GROUND- AND WE'RE THE ONLY. GROUP THAT THAT DOES THAT THAT THAT IS THAT BIG. WE'VE BEEN AROUND FOR OVER A HUNDRED YEARS- SO WE STARTED IN NINETEEN NINETY. AND FOR EACH AND ONE OF THE EACH AND EVERY ONE OF THOSE YEARS. FARMERS HAVE GATHERED FROM AROUND THE STATE TO DISCUSS THE STATE FARM. AND TO TALK ABOUT POLICIES THAT COULD THAT SHOULD GUIDE US- AS YOU CAN IMAGINE THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS HAVE BEEN VERY VERY DIFFICULT- BUT THIS PAST ONE WAS. ABSOLUTELY THE WORST. AND INFLATION IS JUST THE LAST AND MOST PREDICTABLE RESULT OF THE POLICY CHOICES THAT HAVE PUT US IN THE PLACE THAT WE ARE TODAY. I DO NOT GET ME WRONG. I UNDERSTAND EVERY YEAR WE FACE ANOTHER CHALLENGES. WHETHER CLIMATE CHANGE FOUGHT. THIS DISEASE PANDEMIC. ALMOST ETCETERA ARE ALL THINGS WE READ UNDERSTAND THAT WE ARE FACING SEEMINGLY UNPRECEDENTED CHALLENGES RIGHT NOW. IN THE MIDST OF AN EPIC DROUGHT. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEN. AND NOW ON THE POLICY CHOICES WE MAKE. AND WHETHER WE CHOOSE TO LEARN FROM THE PAST OR REPEAT. WHILE THIS MAY BE THE WORST DROUGHT THE FARM BUREAU HAS EVER EXPERIENCED IT IS NOT THE FIRST. WE HAVE BEEN THROUGH MULTIPLE PANDEMICS MULTIPLE WORLD WARS WE WERE HERE BEFORE THE FREEWAYS BEFORE THE DANCE BEFORE THE CANALS BEFORE THE PORTS. WE HAVE LIVED THROUGH THE FARM CRISIS OF THE TWENTIES AND THE THIRTIES THE NINETEEN TWENTIES IN THE NINETEEN THIRTIES WE HAVE LIVED THROUGH THE FARM CRISIS OF THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES. AND EACH ONE OF THOSE WAS LIKE AN EARTHQUAKE RETURN AGAIN TO THE WAY IT WAS. I WOULD IMAGINE THAT MOST PEOPLE I'M FORTY FIVE MOST PEOPLE OF MY AGE. WHO LIVE IN CALIFORNIA HAVE NO IDEA. THE FARM CRISIS OF THE EIGHTIES EVEN EXISTED. I ONE OF THE SPEAKERS MADE REFERENCE TO THE FACT THAT THIS IS THE HIGHEST INFLATION THAT WE HAVE SEEN IN FORTY TWO YEARS I DID A QUICK MATH. TWENTY TWO THOUSAND TWENTY TWO GO BACK FORTY TWO YEARS NINETEEN EIGHTY. SO WE SEE THE CORRELATION WE SEE THE PETE THE PATTERN REPEATING. SO I WOULD POSTULATE THAT WE ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF ANOTHER LIKE CRISIS IN FARMING. BUT WHETHER IT RESULTS IN A SEISMIC SHIFT OR NOT HAS YET TO BE DETERMINED. WE HAVE NOT HAD ANY SERIOUS WATER INVESTMENTS IN THIS STATE FOR OVER THIRTY YEARS. DESPITE FUNDS TO MAKE IT HAPPEN AND VOTER WILLINGNESS. NOW ALL THE CUTS THAT WE HAVE TO TAKE IN URBAN AND RURAL AREAS ARE DEEPER THAN THEY NEEDED TO BE. WE CAN'T EVEN REPAIR THE INFRASTRUCTURE WE HAVE NOW. CENTRE HER TADO HAS BEEN ON A CRUSADE TO REPAIR CANAL A CANAL THAT IS ESSENTIAL TO HER DISTRICTS LIVELIHOOD AND SHE STILL CAN'T GET THE DESIRED FUNDS WHICH IS A MERE 1% OF THE DISCRETIONARY SURPLUS THAT THE STATE HAS AVAILABLE TO IT. BUT IT WAS NOT IN THE MAY REVISE. THERE ARE STILL COMMUNITIES THAT ARE LEFT WANTING. NOW KEEP IN MIND THAT FARMERS AND COMMUNITIES STILL PAY FULL FREIGHT FOR THEIR WATER WHETHER THEY GET IT OR NOT. IN ADDITION TO THE WATER SCARCITY AND PRICE HIKES WE ARE ALSO FACING WHAT YOU HAVE HEARD TODAY INPUT PRICES OF 223100% FORTY TWO RECENT UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS STUDY AMMONIA AND POTASSIUM ESSENTIAL INGREDIENTS FOR FERTILIZER HAVE GONE UP A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY NINE AND A HUNDRED AND 8% RESPECTIVELY YEAR OVER YEAR ACROSS THE NATION. BUT THE NUMBERS THAT I HEAR CALIFORNIANS ARE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER. FRANCE'S ARE ORGANIC GROWERS STRUGGLE TO FARID NITROGEN OF PLACES AND THEY HAVE TO GET CREATIVE AND THOSE THOSE OFTEN REPLYING GLOBAL SUPPLY CHAINS AND THOSE ARE GETTING SQUEEZED. AND THOSE ARE NICHE PRODUCTS TO THAT AREN'T NECESSARILY SOLD IN THE MIDWEST YEAR IF YOU CAN GET. NOW THE USDA ESTIMATES THAT 40% OF CROPS NATIONWIDE ARE LOST DUE TO PESTS AND DISEASE EVERY YEAR. SO DEARTH OF THESE TOOLS ONLY EXACERBATES THE FOOD SUPPLY ISSUE AND UNDERMINES OUR CARBON SEQUESTRATION EFFORTS. SO FOR MY FOR THE TOP FUNGICIDE USED IN CALIFORNIA I MEAN IT THE OTHERS MIGHT NOT IT MIGHT AS WELL NOT EVEN BE CONSIDERED WILL BE 4100% THAT'S FOUR TIMES WHAT IT WAS LAST YEAR. FOR ORGANIC GROWERS HERE IN CALIFORNIA IT'S BASICALLY THE ONLY FUNGICIDE THEY HAVE AVAILABLE AND IT'S GOING TO BE FOUR TIMES WHAT IT WAS LAST YEAR. DIESEL FUEL IS UP MAKE IT ALL WORSE MARKETS ARE EVAPORATING AS THE GLOBAL SUPPLY CHAINS BECOME INCREASINGLY UNAVAILABLE. COME SEPTEMBER WE WILL BE SHAKING ALMOND TREES BUT WE STILL HAVE A HUNDRED MILLION POUNDS SITTING IN WAREHOUSES WAITING FOR THEIR CUSTOMERS OVERSEAS ALREADY BEEN PURCHASED. THEY JUST NEED TO GET A CONTAINER. NOW IT'S THE REVERSE IN TOMATOES. NEWS FOR CATCHMENT SAUCES THEY'RE HOPING THAT THEY CAN GET ENOUGH FRUIT OFF THE VINE TO FILL STORE SHELVES COME JUNE AND JULY. NOW KEEP IN MIND WE ARE 99% OF THE WORLD'S ON THE SUPPLY. WE ARE 90% OF THE UNITED STATES SUPPLY OF PROCESSING TOMATOES A 60% OF THE WORLD'S SUPPLY. THIS IS A GLOBAL PROBLEM JUST YESTERDAY THE GOVERNOR OF THE BANK OF ENGLAND TOLD THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON TREASURY THAT THERE WAS LITTLE THAT THEY COULD DO TO CONTROL INFLATION AND THAT MPS SHOULD BE PREPARED FOR A QUOTE AND A POCKET LIPSTICK GLOBAL FOOD SUPPLY SHORTAGE. THE WORLD BANK JUST TODAY. ANNOUNCED AN ADDITIONAL TWELVE BILLION DOLLARS BRINGING THE TOTAL UP TO THIRTY BILLION AVAILABLE TO FIGHT GLOBAL STREET FOOD SHORTAGES. THE WORLD BANK PRESIDENT DAVID MALPASS SAID IN ANNOUNCING THIS TODAY. THAT QUOTE COUNTRIES SHOULD AKE CONCERTED EFFORTS TO INCREASE THE SUPPLY OF ENERGY AND FERTILIZER. HELP FARMERS INCREASE PLANTINGS AND CROP YIELDS. NO IT WILL NOT SURPRISE YOU TO HEAR THAT WE ARE NOT SEEING THAT FROM THE OTHER THE LEGISLATURE CALIFORNIA OR THE ADMINISTRATION. INSTEAD CALIFORNIA'S GOVERNMENT IS DEBATING THE CHOICE WHETHER TO USE OUR BILLIONS TO GET FARMERS OR RANCHERS TO GROW LESS BY BUYING UP THEIR LAND AND WATER AND PAYING THEM TO GROW LESS FOOD. WE'RE USING THOSE BILLIONS TO BELIEVE THE FARM ECONOMY AND SUPPORT OUR COMMUNITIES AND THE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WHO RELY ON IT. NOW WE COULD CHOOSE TO USE THOSE BILLIONS TO HELP ON HELP THESE EMPLOYEES HAVE ALREADY FORCED REDUCED INCOME TO THE OVERTIME LAW. I'VE HAD TO WORK THROUGH A PANDEMIC TO KEEP EVERYBODY FED AND NOW ARE BEING LAID OFF DUE TO THE DROUGHT. JUST LAST WEEK FIFTEEN HUNDRED PEOPLE WERE LAID OFF IN RICE COUNTRY DUE TO NO PLANTINGS AND NO MAILINGS. WITH NO FOOD COMES NO PROCESSING NO VALUE ADDED NO TRUCKS NO SHIPS NO RETAIL SALES AND NOTHING AVAILABLE FOR FOOD BANKS YOU CAN GIVE THE FOOD BANKS ALL THE MONEY IN THE WORLD TO BUY FOOD BUT THERE NEEDS TO BE FOOD AVAILABLE TO BE BOUGHT. ALL OF THOSE ARE LOST JOBS SO IT IS THE PEOPLE THAT WE WORRY MOST ABOUT. WE MET AS A BOARD YESTERDAY HALF OF THIS YEAR HALF OF US IN DC. AND THAT WAS WHAT THE DISCUSSION WAS ABOUT. OUR BOARD IS MADE UP ENTIRELY OF FARMERS. 101% YOU HAVE TO BE A FORMER TO BE ON OUR BOARD AND THAT IS WHAT THEY TALKED ABOUT THEIR FACING THE RUIN OF THEIR-FARMS. THE END OF HUNDREDS OF YEARS OF FAMILY FARMING AND THEY ARE WORRIED ABOUT THEIR COMMUNITIES AND THEIR EMPLOYEES BECAUSE THEY'RE OUR NEIGHBORS THEIR FAMILY THEIR FRIENDS. AND THEY ARE FACING HARDSHIPS AS YOU HAVE SEEN. SO. WHETHER PEOPLE ARE ABLE TO RETAIN THEIR JOBS ARE NOT THERE FACING SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER FOOD PRICES AS WE'VE HEARD HERE TODAY. SO THE CHOICE IS. THAT WE FACE TODAY. OR WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO. NOW IMAGINE IF WE MADE DIFFERENT CHOICES. IMAGINE IF WE TOLD THE WATER BOARD AND THE WATER COMMISSION THAT ENOUGH IS ENOUGH THE TIME FOR REASONABLE THIS IMPRACTICALITY ARE AT HAND COMMUNITIES TO INVEST IN WATER STORAGE WE SUPPORTING GROUND WATER RECHARGE REPAIRED OUR CANALS AND GAVE REAL RELIEF TO FARMERS AND RANCHERS INSTEAD OF DRIBBLING IT OUT THROUGH NGO INTERMEDIARIES. WE RECOGNIZE THAT WHAT MOST ECONOMISTS ALREADY AGREE ON. THAT THE MOON ROOF BECAUSE OF INFLATION IS AN INCREASE IN THE SUPPLY OF MONEY. SO WE NEED TO STOP BRINGING IT. NOW I KNOW AS WELL AS YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. SO WE ARE LIMITED IN WHAT WE CAN DO TO CONTROL THE SUPPLY OF MONEY. BUT THAT DOES NOT MEAN THAT WE ARE LIMITED IN WHAT WE CAN DO TO STAVE OFF ITS IMPACTS. AS A FAMOUS PRAYER GOES. WE NEED THE SERENITY TO ACCEPT THE THINGS WE CANNOT CHANGE. THE COURAGE TO CHANGE THE THINGS WE CAN. WE CAN CHOOSE TO MAKE RELIEF AVAILABLE TO FARMERS DIRECTLY AND EASILY WE CAN CHOOSE TO PROVIDE A TAX CREDIT THAT WILL HELP EMPLOYERS AFFORD OVERTIME AGAIN PLEASE MORE MONEY. WE CAN CHOOSE TO SUPPORT MORE DAMS STORAGE CAN VANCE ON FARM PONDS WATER RECYCLING GROUNDWATER RECHARGE AND SHORING UP OUR WATER RIGHTS SYSTEM INSTEAD OF ERODING IT. WE CAN SUPPORT THE FARM COMMUNITIES BUT YOU HAVE TO LISTEN TO THE PEOPLE WHO WERE THERE. WERE LIVING IT AND WHO THANKFULLY HAVE BEEN THROUGH IT BEFORE AND HAVE A TRACK RECORD ON WORKING HARD TOWARDS SUCCESS. WE'VE BEEN HERE FOR OVER A HUNDRED YEARS AND HOPED TO BE HERE FOR A HUNDRED MORE. BUT WE HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER. LEARN FROM THE PAST AND HAVE THE COURAGE TO MAKE HARD CHOICES NOW. FOR A BETTER FUTURE. I WILL AND WAS SAYING MR LEVINE YOU HAVE DEMONSTRATED GREAT COURAGE AND YOUR TIME HERE AND LEGISLATURE SO GOD BLESS YOU FOR THAT. THANK YOU JIM HOUSTON. HAVE THE ANSWER QUESTIONS. YEAH I THINK YOU'RE A MUCH DISTRIBUTION YOU DID NOT HOLD ANYTHING BACK YOU YOU'VE- TOLD US EVERYTHING YOU WANTED US TO KNOW SO THANK YOU FOR THAT. OUR NEXT PANELIST IS NICOLE RICE OF THE UNITED FOOD AND COMMERCIAL WORKERS MS RICE. CAN YOU HEAR ME OK WE CAN. WONDERFUL GOOD AFTERNOON THANK YOU FOLKS FOR THE UNITS TOGETHER AND INVITING ME MY NAME IS NICOLE TRUJILLO RICE AND THAT POLITICAL LEGISLATIVE DIRECTOR FOR THE UNITED FOOD COMMERCIAL WORKERS A LOCALLY WE REPRESENT WORKERS FROM THE OREGON BORDER TO THE GREAT FINE WITHIN THE RETAIL GROCERY FOOD PROCESSING WILL TELL ME WHY IN PROCESSING OF LEGALIZED CANNABIS INDUSTRY AND ALSO PHARMACISTS AND PHARMACY TECHNICIANS. IN THE RETAIL SECTOR. AND DIE EIGHT I THINK THAT WHAT MY FELLOW PANELISTS HAVE TALKED ABOUT TERMS OF WORKERS FEELING- THE BRUNT OF A LOT OF THIS IS VERY MUCH TRUE IN IN IN THAT WE ARE IN AGREEMENT ON AND YOU KNOW GROCERY WORKERS OF ALWAYS BEEN ESSENTIAL OF THE PANDEMIC TRULY BROUGHT TO LIGHT HOW CRITICAL THEY ARE FOR THE SURVIVAL OF OUR COMMUNITIES- EVEN THOUGH THE WORKERS ARE ESSENTIAL. TO MANY OF OUR UFCW MEMBERSHIP. STILL CAN'T AFFORD TO BUY FOOD FROM THE GROCERY STORE THEY WORK AT WE KNOW CUSTOMERS ARE FEELING THE PINCH OF GROCERY PRICES WE ARE AT THE CHECK STAND AT THE DELI COUNTER EVERY DAY- THERE'S A CUMULATIVE INCREASE AND ALL OF OUR BASIC HOUSING PRICES GAS PRICES CHILD CARE MEDICINE. OUR WORKERS ARE SUFFOCATING FROM THEIR COST OF LIVING THE REYES IS ACTUALLY THAT THEY JUST RECEIVED SOME OF THEM IN THAT NEWLY RATIFIED CONTRACTS FOR THAT EMPLOYERS THAT WE REPRESENT. THE EXTRA MONEY. THAT THEY HAVE. THE OLD THEY'LL NEED JUST TO GO FOR A GALLON OF GAS OR A GALLON OF MILK AND WHAT WE SO DESPERATELY NEED IS FOR WAGES TO KEEP UP WITH THE COST OF LIVING. AND WE REALLY STEP BACK AND START TO EXAMINE. HOW WE GOT HERE AND WHY WE GOT HERE. THERE ARE NUMBER OF RED FLAGS FOR US THAT REPRESENT WORKERS. IN ORGANIZED LABOR. THE FIRST QUESTION THAT WE'VE BEEN ASKING OURSELVES AND OTHERS POLICYMAKERS THAT ARE THE SKYROCKETING PRICES THE RESULT OF INFLATION OR PRICE GOUGING. I HAVE TO SERIOUSLY QUESTION THAT'S WHEN I SEE RETAIL STORES REPORTING ROCK RECORD PROFITS WHILE THE PEOPLE THAT SHOP AND WORK IN THEIR STORES ARE BARELY MAKING ENDS MEET. A RECENT ANALYSIS DONE BY THE ECONOMIC POLICY INSTITUTE FROM DATA COLLECTED BY THE NATIONAL INCOME AND PRODUCT ACCOUNTS SHOW THAT OVER HALF. OF PRICE INFLATION SINCE MARCH OF TWENTY TWENTY AS COME FROM FATTER PROFIT MARGINS ACCOUNTED FOR LESS THAN 8% THIS IS FAR BIGGER THAN ANY CONTRIBUTION OF FAST WAGE GROWTH ABOUT THE INFLATION OF THE PAST YEAR FOR ONE IT REMINDS US THAT ONE PERSON'S COST IS ANOTHER'S INCOME. AND AS A STATE AND AS A NATION THE MECHANICAL EFFECTS OF INFLATION JUST DON'T MAKE US POOR. HIGHER PRICES IN A GIVEN SECTOR MEAN HIGHER POTENTIAL INCOMES FOR CAPITAL OWNERS AND WORKERS IN THAT SECTOR. HOWEVER WHAT WE'RE SEEING WITH THE CURRENT RECOVERY IS THAT THE HIGHER REVENUE GENERATED BY HIGHER PRICES. AS OVERWHELMINGLY GUNS TO THE CAPITAL OWNERS AND NOT THE WORKERS. THE MOST IMPORTANT ANGLES OF INFLATION ARE DISTRIBUTIONAL SELL ASKING WHY CORPORATE PROFITS ARE SPIKING WHILE INFLATION ADJUSTED WAGES ARE FALLING. IS AMONG THE BIGGEST QUESTION WE NEED TO BE ASKING RIGHT NOW. AND THE NARRATIVE THAT CORPORATIONS ARE ALWAYS LOOKING FOR PROFITS AND ANY ATTEMPT TO NORMALIZE THIS IN SUCH A WAY THAT THE NOTION OF SUCH SHOULD. NEVER ATTRACT THE ATTENTION OF POLICYMAKERS JUST SEEMS WRONG TO ME. ANOTHER SIMPLE MATTER OF FACT THE RISE IN PROFITS HAS BEEN HISTORIC AND HAS EXPLAINED FAR FAR MORE OF THE RISE IN PRICES OVER THE PAST YEAR THEN LABOR COSTS OR IMPORT TARIFFS. SECONDLY I WOULD LIKE TO EXAMINE AND TALK ABOUT- COME MADE IN AMERICA CAN REDUCE SOME OF THE SUPPLY CHAIN ISSUES. THE pUNITED COMMERCIAL WORKERS WESTERN STATE COUNCIL REPRESENTING NINE UFCW LOCALS IN CALIFORNIA ARIZONA AND NEVADA ARE PROUD TO SUPPORT SB THIRTEEN OH EIGHT WHICH THE COPIER- BELL. AND IT WOULD PROTECT CALIFORNIA WORKERS BY AND IMPROVE THE QUALITY AND SAFETY OF SCHOOL MEALS BY CLARIFYING AND STRENGTHENING AND BUY AMERICAN POLICIES- THE UNIONS THAT ARE UFCW THE TEAMSTERS REPRESENT WORKERS AND FOOD IN THE FOOD PROCESSING SPACE AND CALIFORNIA PRODUCES MORE THAN FOUR HUNDRED DIFFERENT AGRICULTURAL COMMODITIES OVER ONE THIRD OF THE COUNTRY'S VEGETABLES AND TWO THIRDS OF THE COUNTRY THREE THE NUTS OVER 99% OF CALIFORNIANS TWELVE HUNDRED DAIRY FARMS ARE FAMILY OWNED AND THE DAIRY SECTOR SECTOR SUPPORT HUNDRED EIGHTY THOUSAND JOBS. OVER FIVE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND RATHER PEOPLE WORKING CALIFORNIA'S AGRICULTURE INDUSTRY FROM FARMWORKERS TO WORKERS AND FOOD PROCESSING AND CANNERIES. UNION JOBS IN CARRIES AND FRUIT PROCESSING AMONG OTHERS PROVIDE GOOD WAGES BENEFITS AND RETIREMENT SECURITY WORKERS BUT UNDER CURRENT USDA REGULATIONS SCHOOL DISTRICTS CAN BYPASS THE EXISTING BUY AMERICAN REQUIREMENTS AND PURCHASE PRODUCTS IMPORTED FROM OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES IF THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT COST DIFFERENTIAL BETWEEN DOMESTIC AND IMPORTED FOOD PRODUCTS. CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS PURCHASE LOWER QUALITY GOODS BROWN AND PRODUCED OUTSIDE OF THE COUNTRY UNDER LESS STRINGENT WORKER HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS DESPITE THE FACT THAT CALIFORNIA IS ONE OF THE MOST PRODUCTIVE AGRICULTURAL REGIONS IN THE WORLD IT ALSO HAS A STRONG BELIEVER STANDARDS THAT PROTECT WORKERS PUBLIC HEALTH AND THE ENVIRONMENT. B. AG INDUSTRY IS FELT THE IMPACT OF OVERSEAS COMPETITION IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN SENECA FOODS A PRODUCER OF PGM FRUIT COCKTAIL PRODUCTS. CHEN IT'S MODESTO PLANTS LAYING OFF TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE. FULL TIME WORKERS AND NEARLY A THOUSAND SEASONAL WORKERS THE COMPANY CITED IMPORTANT COMPETITION FROM OVERSEAS CHINA AND EUROPE AND THE REASON FOR THE PLANT CLOSURE. BUY AMERICA PROVISIONS ARE GOOD FOR WORKERS PRODUCERS STUDENTS AND THE ENVIRONMENT AND PERHAPS MOST IMPORTANTLY FOR THIS TIME WE'RE LIVING IN. WE CAN HELP REDUCE SUPPLY CHAIN ISSUES ALONG WITH OVERSEAS COMPETITION. AND I THINK JUST TO WRAP IT UP I WOULD LIKE TO ASK THIS BODY THOSE TWO FUNDAMENTAL QUESTIONS LOOKING AT AS WELL AS LEANING AGAINST YOU- THE BROADER DIALOGUE THAT WE'RE HAVING AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL AROUND BY AMERICAN AND BUILD BACK BETTER. THANK YOU I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR HERE RICE- GRATEFUL FOR YOUR PARTICIPATION IN TODAY'S PANEL- THERE'S A LOT TO COVER- IN THE- LAST FEW MINUTES THAT WE HAVE- THIS ROOM FOR WE DO RENTAL BY THE HOUR BUT- I TO WANT TO BRING US BACK TO THE BABY FORMULA SHORTAGE AND- CERTAINLY FOR GROCERS- WE DID SEE. FOURTEEN AND SUPPLY CHAIN ISSUES IN IN THE PANDEMIC WHERE WE DID HAVE TO. PUT IN PLACE WE DIDN'T TAKE GROCERS DID PUT INTO PLACE SOME TYPE OF- IT'S TERRIBLE CAUGHT RATIONING IT MAKES US FEEL LIKE WE'RE YOU KNOW. IN BEHIND THE- IRON CURTAIN- BUT- SOMETIMES A LIMIT ON HOW MUCH PEOPLE CAN BUY OF CERTAIN PRODUCTS HAVE WE SEEN THE INSTITUTE HERE FOR BABY FORMULA. YOU KNOW I CAN'T SPEAK TO EXACTLY WHAT EACH INDIVIDUAL COMPANY IS DOING ON THAT- AND WHAT YOU KNOW EACH INDIVIDUAL RETAILERS DOING ON THAT SPECIFICALLY. HOWEVER YOU KNOW WE ARE SEEING VERY MUCH THE SHORTAGE OF SUPPLY OUR OUR MEMBERS ARE GETTING. THE ORDERS FOR FILTERS THAT THEY'VE PLACED- OUR- FIRST MOST SIGNIFICANT PRIORITY- IN WORKING WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WORKING WITH DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH HERE IN CALIFORNIAWHO BY THE WAY HAVE BEEN. PHENOMENAL AND HELPING US NAVIGATE THIS ISSUE- IS MAKING SURE FIRST ND FOREMOST THAT WAKE PARTICIPANTS- ARE ABLE TO BE ABLE TO BE SERVICED AND HELPS AND THEY'RE GETTING THE PROPER FORMULA THAT THEY NEED- THERE'S ALSO A BIG CONCERN AROUND- THE MEDICALLY NECESSARY FORMULAS. YOU KNOW I THINK AND I'M GOING TO GUESS HERE A LITTLE BIT THAT MAYBE WITH THE LACK OF REGULAR FORMULA- BEING AS AVAILABLE AS IT HAS BEEN IN THE PAST OTHER PEOPLE THAT WOULD MAYBE BE ABLE TO UTILIZE THAT MIGHT BE GOING TOWARD- UTILIZING THE ONES THAT ARE TYPICALLY MORE IT MEDICALLY NECESSARY THAT AREN'T BEHIND- THE COUNTER. VIA A PRESCRIPTION. SO WE'RE SEEING SOME CONCERNS AND ISSUES THERE- I YOU KNOW WE WORK REALLY WELL WITH OUR FEDERAL COUNTERPARTS IN DC- WHO HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH THE USDA- ON NAVIGATING THESE ISSUES- YOU KNOW WE GOT AN UPDATE ACTUALLY WHILE I WAS- YOU KNOW WALKING IN HERE EARLIER TODAY- YOU KNOW THAT THEY BELIEVE THAT AND THEY'LL BE ABLE TO RESUME- AN OPEN REOPEN THAT. PLANT IN MICHIGAN- IN ABOUT TWO WEEKS AND RESUME PRODUCTION FOLLOWING ON THE FDA APPROVAL. OF THEIR OF THEIR RE OPENING- AND THEN WILL BE ABLE TO SEE- THAT FORMULA HIT STORE SHELVES IN ABOUT SIX TO EIGHT WEEKS. I'M SO THAT'S OUR BEST ESTIMATE YOU KNOW WE'RE REALLY JUST- WORKING ON HELPING OUR MEMBERS MAKE SURE THAT- THEY HAVE A CONNECTION TO THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH- VERY CLOSE CONNECTION TO BE ABLE TO- FACILITATE- AND SUPPORT THEM IN GETTING THE SUPPLIES THAT THEY NEED FOR. YOU KNOW FOR THEIR CUSTOMERS AND WHAT PEOPLE ARE NEED ESPECIALLY THOSE ON THE WICK PROGRAM- IS A VERY IMPORTANT PIECE TO US- I WILL I WILL SAY THAT. WE THEY'RE WORKING VERY HARD ON THAT. I HAVEN'T SEEN TOO MANY PUT IN- CAPS AND STUFF BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHEN YOU GET TO SOMETHING SO. PERSONAL SOMETHING SO VERY NECESSARY. NEED OFTENTIMES FORMULA IS THE ONLY FOOD SOURCE FOR A BABY- THEY DON'T WANT TO LIMIT AND CAP INDIVIDUALS- IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO GET THAT. YOU KNOW WHAT THEY NEED FOR THEIR CHILDREN. WE DID WE DD SEE THAT IN A DIVERSE BUT VERY SPECIFIC THIS BABY FORMULA SHORTAGE WHICH HAS HAD THIS ENTIRE COUNTRY FOR NUMEROUS DIFFERENT ISSUES BUT WE SAW. BEHAVIOR DRIVING THESE CONCERNS AND THE PANDEMIC BUT NOW WE HAVE. AN INFLATION A SITUATION AND THE SPECIFIC SHORTAGE ISSUE. DOES THE INDUSTRY SEE OTHER INFLATION SHORTAGE- COMBINATIONS- IT HISTORICALLY OR- IS THIS JUST UNIQUE IN THE SENSE INSTANCE. WELL I THINK YOU KNOW I THINK THAT THE PROFESSOR SPOKE EARLIER ABOUT- EGGS AND THE ISSUE THERE THAT WERE SEEN WITH AVIAN FLU IMPACTING- EGG PRICES AND THEN ALSO INFLATION. YOU KNOW- I THINKTHAT'S ANOTHER PRETTY RELEVANT CURRENT EXAMPLE SO WE DID HERE- FROM THIS TRUTH YOUR RICE ABOUT WORKERS AND- INCOME AND HOW INFLATION ISN'T HELPING THEM. WITH THE COST OF LIVING IN- AT ALL- AND IT'S AN INTERESTING POINT WE'VE WE LET OUR ECONOMISTS ARE NOT WITH US ANY LONGER- BUT YOU KNOW HOW HOW IS THAT AFFECTED THEM IS THERE CAN YOU TELL US A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THAT- BECAUSE YOU KNOW THERE'S OF COURSE PEOPLE. PUSH OUT THAT RISING WAGES DRIVES INFLATION- BUT YET YOU KNOW IT'S SAD NOT TO USE THE AG METAPHOR TOO OFTEN A CHICKEN OR THE EGG HERE YOU KNOW HOW TO PEOPLE FOR TO LIVE I'M IN A SITUATION LIKE THAT. WE JUST WANNA KEEP UP. ABSOLUTELY I THINK THAT IS THE QUESTION. OF OUR WORKERS THAT WE REPRESENT FORTUNATELY DO YOU HAVE A COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT WHERE THEY HAVE RECEIVED- SOME RACES RECENTLY THEY ASO HAVE A DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN. THE EMPLOYERS PAY INTO- AS WELL AS- A PORTABLE HEALTHCARE. THEIR WAGES HAVEN'T GONE UP ESPECIALLY IN THE OTHER ARM THE SAME SECTOR BUT THE NON UNION. STORES SO THAT IS THE QUESTION THAT WE HAVE USUALLY INFLATION INDICATES RAISING WAGES AS WELL RIGHT WE JUST HAVEN'T RISEN. WE HAVEN'T SEEN. A SHIFT TOWARD BEING ABLE TO AFFORD THESE GOODS AND- IT'S NOT JUST GROCERIES THAT'S THE EXAM THAT WE'RE GIVING BECAUSE OF THOSE THE WORKERS THAT WE REPRESENT IN FOOD PROCESSING THEIR EVERYDAY NEEDS. OUR WORKERS DIDN'T GET TO WORK FROM HOME THEY SHOWED UP EVERY DAY ON THE FRONT LINE. SO YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT GAS CHILD CARE. ALL OF THESE RAISING HOUSING PRICES ARE BEING SQUEEZED OUT OF EVERY MARKET. AND WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT A WAY WHERE WE CAN. ALSO INCREASE THEIR WAGES DO YOU TO COMPETE. YEAH THANK YOU FOR MENTIONING THE CHILD CARE ISSUE WE JUST ON THE- SOUTH SIDE OF THE CAPITOL HAVE CHILD CARE WORKERS WHO ARE RALLYING TODAY- BECAUSE THEY ARE ALSO FEELING LEFT BEHIND- IN THIS- ECONOMIC SITUATION WE ALL FIND OURSELVES AND- DISTRIBUTION YOU TALKED ABOUT TOMATOES AND CATCH UP WHICH IS SOMETHING A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT A LOT OF STAPLES. PEOPLE REALLY SEEM TO UNDERSTAND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT EVERYONE HAS. ONE OF THE ECONOMY ECONOMIST EARLIER TALK ABOUT PAPRIKA THAT SEEMS A LITTLE BIT MORE- ARE LESS EXISTENTIAL BENT AND CATCH UP DOES- FOR- MOST MOST PEOPLE- TOMATOES ARE- AS YOU MENTIONED. THE UNITED STATES SUPPLY PROCESSING TOMATOES SO IS THERE IT'S INTERESTING TO ME BECAUSE- YOU KNOW MAYBE THIS IS A BIG GROCERS CAN CAN GIVE A PERSPECTIVE ON THIS. WE IN CALIFORNIA- YOU MAY AGREE WITH US- TAKE OUR AGRICULTURE FOR GRANTED. IT'S ALWAYS GOING TO BE THERE- WE'RE ALWAYS GOING TO HAVE KETCHUP OR SALSA OR WHATEVER THAT COMMENT IS THAT WE LIKE TO THIS TOMATO BASED- AND- AND SO- WHAT TYPE OF FEEDBACK. ARE YOU YOUR ORGANIZATIONS GETTING FROM. YOU KNOW OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA AS TO ALL OF YOUR YOU KNOW WHETHER IT'S WATER POLICY OR AGRICULTURAL POLICY OR EVEN LABOR POLICY LIKE WHAT IS CALIFORNIA DOING THAT'S PUTTING- STAPLES THAT WE ALL DEPEND UPON. SOMEWHERE ELSE AT RISK BECAUSE CALIFORNIA'S- WORKING AGAINST- YOU KNOW THE PRODUCTION OF THESE THINGS. YEAH I MEAN THAT'S A THAT'S A REALLY GOOD QUESTION- YOU KNOW EVERYBODY ENOUGH MISTER REAVIS- WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE A HEARING TOMORROW- THEY GOT POSTPONED AND I WAS GONNA TALK. ABOUT THAT THAT SORT OF VERY ISSUE IN TERMS OF THE COMPETITIVENESS- AND I THINK THAT'S YOU KNOW I'M I MEAN ALL DUE RESPECT BUT AS I WAS LISTENING TO THE HEARING I MEAN EVERYBODY JUST ASSUMED THE FOOD WOULD BE THERE. YOU KNOW THEY NEED MORE MONEY TO BUY IT THAT BUT IT'S GOING TO BE THERE RIGHT NOBODY NOBODY TALK ABOUT WHAT WE NEED TO HELP OUR FRMERS GROW MORE FOOD- AND I THINK THAT'S WHY RIGHT- AND SO BECAUSE EVERYBODY JUST ASSUMES THAT THAT THAT WILL HAPPEN- BUT THAT'S CERTAINLY NOT THE CASE AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE GLOBAL FOOD SUPPLY GLOBAL HUNGER- ALL THOSE- INDICES ARE. ARE RISING YOU HEARD THE FOOD BAK PEOPLE TALK ABOUT EIGHT MILLION PEOPLE HERE IN CALIFORNIA THAT ARE FREE TO IS SECURE AND ALL THAT HAS TO DO WITH THE COMPETITIVENESS OF OUR- FARMERS AND RANCHERS BECAUSE THEY ARE COMPETING AGAINST PEOPLE IN. THE- AND I MEAN. THANK GOD BLESS ALL THE PEOPLE IN THE OTHER COUNTRIES ARE GROW FOOD I MEAN THEY'RE TRYING TO MAKE A LIVING TO YOU NOW- BUT- THE FACT IS THAT WE HAVE CERTAIN STANDARDS THAT WE HAVE HELD OUR GROWERS TO HEAR AND WHETHER THAT BE- THE OTHER TO THE PRICE OF JUST HIRING SOMEBODY IS. MORE THAN DOUBLE HERE THAT IN THE FEDERAL MINIMUM WAGE OF SEVEN TWENTY FIVE I'M NOT. IN ANY WAY ADVOCATE OF THE PEOPLE SHOULD MAKE SEVEN TWENTY FIVE WHAT I'M SAYING LIKE HERE CALIFORNIA WE'RE DOUBLE THAT YOU KNOW AND WHEN THE CALMEST ABOUT HE TALK ABOUT WAGES IN TWENTY TWENTY TWO DOLLARS AND IN REALITY THAT IS. THAT'S THE FUNNY THING ABOUT PEOPLE DON'T UNDERSTAND ABOUT AGRICULTURE AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE NATIONAL STATISTICS ABOUT WAGES- MINIMUM WAGE WE HAVE ONE OF THE LOWEST PERCENTAGES OF EMPLOYEES THAT ARE MAKING- OF THE- ADAM BELOW MINIMUM WAGE WHEN YOU COMPARE IT TO OTHER- YOU KNOW RETAIL- CONSTRUCTION MINING TRANSPORTATION OTHERS- ALWAYS COMPLIANCES. IS SIMILARLY THROUGH THE ROOF SO BECAUSE WE% CARE BUT WE ALSO WE- WHAT WE HAVE OVERTIME AFTER FORTY HOURS NO ONE ELSE DOES- WE HAVE. WE HAVE CAL SAVERS RIGHT NOW SO FARM HERE HAS- FOR ONE K- THAT WE OFFER TO A FORMER POLICE. WHICH IS HONESTLY A BETTER DEAL CALCIUM- WE BUT WE- AT LEAST WE HAVE THAT. RIGHT WE HAVE HIGHER WATER COSTS HERE SO WE HAVE THE WATER RIGHTS FEES ARE JUST OUT OF CONTROL RIGHT OF THE GO OF EVERY EVERY YEAR- WELL THE- AMOUNT OF PESTICIDES THAT WERE. ABLE TO USE HERE IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE IT. NOW I LIKE THE I MEAN DEEP THERE'S A GREAT SYSTEM AND WE'RE ALL BETTER OFF FOR IT. RIGHT BUT THAT SYSTEM IS EACH COST MORE TO IMPLEMENT- AND THERE. I THINK OKAY. INSTEAD OF CELEBRATING DVR. WHAT I MEAN THEIR PLACE TO- YOU KNOW HEY YOU KNOW IF HE BROKE A FIX IT BUT THEY'RE POISED TO MAKE THE- YARD MORE EXPENSIVE MAKE PESTICIDES LESS AVAILABLE MORE EXPENSIVE- YOU KNOW SAME THING WITH FERTILIZERS. AND SO ALL OF THESE INPUT COSTS. ARE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE THAN THEY ARE- IT. TO OUR COMPETITORS- AND SO THE SIMPLE COST OF DOING BUSINESS- YOU KNOW GROSS HERE. WE ALSO. HAVE- YEAH MORE. I KNOW WELL WE HAVE A LOT OF WELL CAPITALIZED- FOLKS THAT AR ABLE TO COME IN. AND BUY YOU KNOW SORT OF SECURITIZE ACLAND WHICH IS VERY CONCERNED AND YOU KNOW YOU KNOW HARVARD GROWS A LOT ALMONDS HERE. YOU KNOW- AND SO THAT- MAKES SORT OF I MEAN FOR LACK OF A RESERVE THE NORMAL FARMER RIGHT LIKE IF I JUST WANTED TO GO AND INTO FARMING I NOW HAVE TO COMPETE AGAINST THESE VERY VERY WELL CAPITALIZED. ENTITIES IN OUR STATE SO THERE'S BOTH YOU KNOW SORT OF OUTSIDE MONEY COMING INTO THE STATE PUSHING OUT CALIFORNIA FOLKS- BUT ALSO CALIFORNIA FARMERS AND RANCHERS ARE NOT COMPETITIVE AGAINST THEIR OUT OF STATE AND OUT OF- COUNTRY COUNTERPARTS YOU DON'T HAVE TO. MEET ALL OF THE SAME REQUIREMENTS- THE WE DO CLOSE FOR AG BY THE WAY I DIDN'T MENTION THAT MY GOSH WE DO CLOSE MORE ACCURATE YOU KNOW I MEAN UNDER FORMAL PRETENSES FOR TEN YEARS. BUT YOU KNOW WHEN IN REALITY FOR TWENTY THIRTY YEARS- WE'RE THE ONLY STATE THAT DOES IT. YOU KNOW- AND SO IT'S ALL OF THOSE THINGS THAT I THAT THAT YOU KNOW LIKE WHEN WE THINK OF CALIFORNIA ACT IT MAKES US PROUD- AND THAT'S WHY WE GO TO THE GROCERY STORE WE GO TO THE FARMER I'M OUT ONE THE MOST EXCITING THINGS THAT HAPPENED TO ME. IN THE PAST MONTH IS WE GOT A FARMERS MARKET AT THE ELKS LODGE ON SATURDAYS AND NOW I GET TO RIDE MY BIKE TO THE FARMERS MARKET WITH MY KIDS IT'S THE IT'S THE COOLEST THING. WE TAKE THAT FOR GRANTED. OUR WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH MYSTERY SO I SAY THANK YOU TO ALL OF THE PANELISTS FOR OUR THIRD PANEL. IMPACTS OF INFLATION ON FOOD GROWERS PRODUCERS AND WORKERS. THAT'S MISS. KELLY ASH FROM THE CALIFORNIA GROCERS ASSOCIATION MR JIM HOUSTON FROM THE CALIFORNIA FARM BUREAU. AND IS UNITED FOOD AND COMMERCIAL WORKERS THANK YOU SO MUCH TO ALL THREE OF YOU. AND WE NOW THE LAST WORD GOES TO THE PUBLIC. SO IF PUBLIC COMMENT. AND I WOULD LIKE TO INVITE THE PUBLIC. TO COME. AND AND- SHARE YOUR REMARKS. WITH A GROUP OF. THE REPRESENTING THE PUBLIC I'M REPRESENTING THE PUBLIC ACTUALLY GREG GARNER ON BEHALF OF THE CAN MANUFACTURERS INSTITUTE- ASSEMBLY MEMBER ONE THING WE WOULD WE REALLY APPRECIATE YOU HAVING THIS- THE YOU'VE HAD SOME GREAT PANELS AND RAISE A LOT OF GOOD ISSUES- WE WANT TO RAISE SOME ISSUES SPECIFIC TO- OTHER THINGS THAT'S CREATING THAT'S GONNA CONTRIBUTE TO FOOD AND SECURITY IN THE COMING YEAR AS EARLY AS THIS YEAR DEFINITELY BY NEXT YEAR THAT'S RELATED TO TERRACE AND QUOTAS. FOR TEN PLATE. AS YOU KNOW CALIFORNIA IS A BIG CANNING STATE FOR OUR FOOD- THE CAN MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY DOES OVER TWENTY TWO AND A HALF BILLION FOOD CANS PURGE. YEAR AND SHIPMENTS GREW ABOUT TWELVE POINT 8% DURING THE PANDEMIC- BUT WE ARE HAVING I'M SORRY I DIDN'T ENTER WILL RUN FROM THE SWING SPACE SO I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR ME GETTING MY WORK OUT TODAY. WE'RE LIVING IN WE'RE LIVING IT BUT THE YOU KNOW THE FIRST DAYS IN THE NINETIES THERE ARE TOUGH- THERE'S BEEN A STEEP DECLINE IN DOMESTIC TEN PLATE PRODUCTION. PLUS THE TARIFFS AND QUOTAS ON IMPORTED TEMPLATE ARE CREATING A NATIONAL FOOD SECURITY CRISIS. ONLY 2% OF DOMESTIC STEEL PER PRODUCED IS TEN PLATE. ONLY EIGHT TEMPLATE LINE'S EXISTING US TODAY DOWN FROM ELEVEN. LINES BEFORE TARIFFS WERE IMPOSED ONE OF THOSE IS SCHEDULED TO CLOSE IN TWENTY TWENTY THREE. SO BY THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY THREE DOMESTIC SOURCES WILL BE BELOW PANDEMIC SHOWS THAT 83% OF OUR COUNTRY'S KITCHENS HAVE CANNED FOOD IN THEIR PANTRIES AND THANK YOU. WE BELIEVE THIS HAS. CREASE DURING THE PANDEMIC. THESE HIGH QUALITY AFFORDABLE PRODUCTS ARE ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT FOR LOW INCOME AMERICANS AND U. S. FOOD BANKS AND THAT'S WHY I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR HAVING THEM ON- AMERICANS CONSUME ON AVERAGE FIVE CANS OF FRUITS AND VEGETABLES PER WEEK. BUT RECIPIENTS OF SNAP AND WEBER CONSUME SEVEN POINT ONE CANCER FREAKS IN VEGETABLES. 25% OF THE FRUIT CONSUMED AN AVERAGE AMERICAN HOUSEHOLDS ARE CAN'T. VEGETABLES FOR THE AVERAGE AMERICAN HOUSEHOLD 39% OF SNACKS AND WITH HOUSEHOLDS. AN 56% OF THE AVERAGE HOUSEHOLD WILL CALL AVERAGE HOUSEHOLD THINK THAT CANNED FOOD IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT FOR THEIR NUTRITION FOR THEIR FAMILY 67% OF SNACKS AND WITH RECIPIENTS I BELIEVE IT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT FOR THE HEALTH. OF THEIR FAMILY. THE MINUTES GIPSON I KNOW YOU'RE RUNNING OUT OF TIME BUT- IT IS POSSIBLE THAT LIMITED STEEL SUPPLY WILL RESULT IN SOME CROP AND FOOD PRODUCTS NOT BEING CAN'T. REPEAT WE HAVE THE POTENTIAL THAT WE WILL HAVE CROPS THAT WON'T BE CAN'T THESE ARE CROPS THAT. THEY'RE NOT GONNA BE SOLD IN OTHER MARKETS THE GROUND GROWN SPECIFICALLY FOR CANNING THEY WILL BE TOLD UNDER OR NOT ACCEPTED BECAUSE WILL RUN OUT OF SUPPLIES IN ORDER TO CAN THEM. SO WITH IMPORTS OF CANNED PRODUCTS UP SUBSTANTIALLY IN TWENTY TWENTY. BECAUSE OF OUR TARIFFS WHEN WE HAVE- BASICALLY 40% OF THE COST OF A CANNED PRODUCT IS THE COST OF THE CAN. 80% OF THAT NOW IS A TERROR OF COST. SO AS YOU CAN SEE CHINA IS ACTUALLY AND OTHER COUNTRIES ARE ABLE TO IMPORT. PRODUCTS FREE. TO WHERE WE HAVE OUR CONSUMERS AND SCHOOLS BUYING FOREIGN PRODUCTS RATHER THAN THOSE PRODUCTS GROWN RIGHT HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IS A SERIOUS SERIOUS- FOOD SECURITY ISSUE YEAH WE DID HEAR CONCERNS ABOUT THAT FROM ONE OF THE LAST PANELISTS OKAY YEAH WELL. WE THANK YOU FOR THIS HEARING AND APPRECIATE YOUR TIME AND WE'D LIKE TO WORK WITH YOU ON THIS ISSUE YEAH I THINK YOU'RE MUCH MISTER TURNER- THANK YOU THAT WILL BE THE END OF- PUBLIC COMMENT.

DO AN AIRING OF THESE ISSUES SO THAT WE CAN SEE HOW INFLATION IS IMPACTING CALIFORNIANS. A NUTRITION IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT AND IT IS AT RISK WHEN PEOPLE CANNOT AFFORD- HEALTHY. FRUITS VEGETABLES AND OTHER GROCERIES. SO THANK YOU THAT IS THE END OF OUR HEARING. THANKS TERRY WHAT. THANK YOU. FOUR PEOPLE HAVE.
