BALL FUNDING OVER A HUNDRED AND THIRTY FOUR RESEARCH PROJECTS WITHOUT RENEWAL OF THE FUND WILL EXPIRE AND NOT APPEAR ON THE TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN STATE. TAX FORM. TODAY I ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE IS THE THIRD LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH IN CALIFORNIA WITH NO KNOWN CAUSE CURE A PREVENTION. AS MANY AS SIX HUNDRED THIRTY THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS CURRENTLY LIVE WITH THE DISEASE IN MORE THAN ONE POINT SIX MILLION FAMILY CAREGIVERS PROVIDE UNPAID SUPPORT TO A LOVED ONE WITHOUT TIMERS. THE STATE WILL SPEND THREE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS THIS YEAR ALONE ON MEDI CAL BENEFICIARIES WITH THE CONDITION. THE FUNDS FROM THE TAX CHECK OFF PROVIDE RESEARCH THAT ENCOMPASSES A SUCH AS BASIC LOVE SCIENCE DIAGNOSIS TREATMENT DRUG THERAPIES AND CARE GIVING TO NAME A FEW. MANY OF CALIFORNIA'S MAJOR PUBLIC AND PRIVATE UNIVERSITIES HAVE BEEN RECIPIENTS OF THIS FUNDING AND THEY HAVE BEEN INSTRUMENTAL IN ATTRACTING YOUNG RESEARCHERS AND NEW SCIENTISTS. TO THE FIELD OF ALZHEIMER'S RESEARCH. THE HUMAN AND ECONOMIC COSTS ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE AND RELATED DEMENTIAS ARE STAGGERING. MORE PEOPLE WITH ALZHEIMER'S LIVING CALIFORNIA THAN ANY OTHER STATE AND BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE THE NUMBER WILL GROW BY THIRTY THREE PERCENT TO EIGHT. HUNDRED AND FORTY THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS ALMOST THE SIZE THIS OF THE CITY OF SAN JOSE. THAT THE THIRD MOST POPULATED SAYING THIS STATE THAT I REPRESENT. INVESTING IN RESEARCH TO FIND THE CAUSE CARE PREVENTION FOR THIS FATAL DISEASE BENEFITS EACH AND EVERYONE OF US AND OUR FAMILIES.

A I HAVE WITH ME TODAY DOCTOR CHARLES TO CARLY TO TESTIFY ON THIS IMPORTANT BILL AND CERTAINLY ASK BUT I DON'T APPRECIATE THE CHAIR'S RECOMMENDATION WHEN THIS ISN'T SUPPORT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU CHAIRWOMAN AND MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE. I WANT TO JUST TOUCH AND A COUPLE OF VERY IMPORTANT POINT BECAUSE IT WAS SO A WELL ARTICULATED BY MY COLLEAGUE. WE HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE AFFECTED BY THIS DISEASE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S HAPPENING IN AS WE ARE. SOCIETY GETS OLDER IS IT'S BECOMING MORE DIVERSE AND SO THE OTHER THING THAT WASN'T TOUCHED ON BY MY COLLEAGUE. IS THAT NOT ONLY ARE WE HAVING MORE. OLDER PEOPLE BUT MORE DIVERSE OLDER PEOPLE AND WE DON'T UNDERSTAND THE DIFFERENCE IS BECAUSE THERE ARE DISPARITIES LATINOS AND AFRICAN AMERICANS ARE NEARLY TWICE AS LIKELY TO GET A DEMENTIA. IN LATER LIFE. THIS PROGRAM WHICH IS BE AND. I THINK INCREDIBLY POPULAR WITH CALIFORNIA VOTERS THAT'S NUMBER THREE ON THE CHECK OFF LIST ON AND IT REPRESENTS I THINK WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH THE BABY BOOM GENERATION. OF WHICH I AM A MEMBER. THAT. BEYOND CANCER. ALZHEIMER'S AND DEMENTIA ARE THAT IS NUMBER TWO CONCERN OF THE BABY BOOM GENERATION. THESE CONTRIBUTIONS. FACT JUNIOR PEOPLE MOSTLY JUNIOR RESEARCHERS AND SCIENTISTS AND TO GET THEM STARTED. AND THAT'S HOW CALIFORNIA CONTINUES TO BUILD WOULD BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO BUILD THEIR RESEARCH INFRASTRUCTURE AND CONTINUED TO BE I THINK THE LEADING INNOVATOR IN ALZHEIMER'S AND DEMENTIA RESEARCH IN THE COUNTRY IF NOT IN THE WORLD. SO I CAN ONLY SAY THAT I ABSOLUTELY AND ENTHUSIASTICALLY. SUPPORT THIS A CONTINUATION OF THIS BILL IN ALL ITS FORMS AND HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE. THANK YOU.

MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MADAM CHAIRWOMAN I'M HERE TO PRESENT AB TWO ONE THREE ONE I WOULD LIKE TO START BY SAYING THAT I WILL BE TAKING THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS. AFTER THE PAST EIGHT YEARS CO MAGAZINE IS RIGHT CALIFORNIA THE WORST PLACE TO DO BUSINESS. BILL BEFORE YOU TODAY WILL PROVIDE CALIFORNIA BUSINESSES A SMALL BUT MUCH NEEDED TAX RELIEF. BY CUTTING THE MINIMUM FRIENDS TYPE FRANCHISE TAX IN HALF. THE MINIMUM FRANCHISE TAX TO CALIFORNIA'S CURRENTLY THE HIGHEST IN THE NATION EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLARS. COMPARED TO FIFTY DOLLARS IN ARIZONA OR HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS IN OREGON. THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE RECENTLY REPORTED THAT REDUCING THIS TAX WOULD PROVIDE TAX RELIEF AN ECONOMIC INCENTIVE TO BUSINESSES IN THIS STATE. THIS WOULD ARE CALIFORNIA WOULD GAIN MORE FROM ENCOURAGING ENTREPRENEURS TO OPEN A BUSINESS AND HIRE EMPLOYEES THAN ANY REVENUE LOST FROM THIS MINIMUM FRANCHISE TAX EXEMPTION. HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT THIS MEASURE SHAUN LOWEST FROM THE NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT BUSINESSES AND WE PATTERSON WITH CAPITAL LEGAL INVESTIGATION AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. HI SHAUN LUIS WITH THE NFIB CALIFORNIA REPRESENTING OVER TWENTY THOUSAND SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS IN CALIFORNIA. A SMALL INDEPENDENT BUSINESSES IN ABOUT THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND BUSINESSES ACROSS THE COUNTRY. IN SUPPORT AS AB TWENTY ONE THIRTY ONE BUT PROVIDE IMMEDIATE DIRECT FINANCIAL RELIEF TO THOUSANDS OF OUR MEMBERS AND MANY MANY MORE. A BUSINESSES IN GENERAL ACROSS THE STATE JUST A COUPLE QUICK POINTS OUT WHAT WE DO KNOW IS THAT SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS DO DRIVE THE CALIFORNIA. AND UNITED STATES ECONOMY AND CALIFORNIA NINE NINE POINT EIGHT PERCENT OF ALL BUSINESSES ARE SMALL BUSINESSES AND HALF OF ALL EMPLOYEES ARE EMPLOYED BY A SMALL BUSINESS SO. THIS BILL WOULD PROVIDE BENEFIT AND RELIEF TO THOSE. SMALL INDEPENDENT BUSINESSES ABOUT SIXTY PERCENT OF OUR MEMBERS. FILE AS PASSED AT PASS THROUGH. AB BUSINESSES SO IT WOULD BENEFIT THEM GREATLY. AND WE FIND THAT OUR MEMBERS TELL US THIS ANNUAL EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLAR MINIMUM FRANCHISE TAX. JUST FOR THE PRIVILEGE OF DOING BUSINESS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA CAN BE VERY COST PROHIBITIVE SO FOR SOME MAY SAY IT WOULD BE A SLIGHT BENEFIT. OUR MEMBERS TELL US WOULD BE SIGNIFICANT BENEFIT AND WE BELIEVE IN OUR MEMBERS BELIEVE THAT TAX POLICY SHOULD BE A REFLECTION OF OUR. PRIORITIES AND WHEN MY MEMBERS CALL AND ASK ME HOW CAN CALIFORNIA AFFORD HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN TAX BREAKS FOR BIG MOTION PICTURE OR BIG SOLAR. CAN'T WE PROVIDE THIS MODEST TAX RELIEF TO THE ENGINE OF OUR ECONOMY OUR SMALL BUSINESS JOB CREATORS WE HOPE SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT. WE HAVE A MOTION FROM A SIMILAR ALLEN IN THE SECOND FROM BRO. ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. JENNIFER TANNAHILL ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA SOCIETY OF ENROLLED AGENTS MANY ENROLLED AGENTS HAVE A CLIENTS WITH VERY TINY NEW BUSINESSES AND THIS BILL WOULD I HOPE THAT GET THOSE BUSINESSES OFF THE GROUND SOBRE IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. WHEN HE'S IN OFFICE THOSE ARE COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS LUKE PATTERSON I'M WITH CAPITAL LEGAL INVESTIGATIONS I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF LICENSED INVESTIGATORS. FOR TWELVE HUNDRED INVESTIGATORS THEIR MEMBERS A TALLY. ALMOST ALL OF THEM ARE SMALL BUSINESS PEOPLE. AND THIS REDUCTION IN THE FRANCHISE TAX WOULD BE SMALL BUT STILL WELL APPRECIATED AND MAY HELP SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES MOVE FROM BEING A SOLE OPERATOR. INTO THE CORPORATE WORLD. THINK YOU WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. DANIELLE CANADA BECAUSE OUR ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA TAX REFORM ASSOCIATION WE ARE STILL REVIEWING THE SPELL BUT WE DO ANTICIPATE. AND OPPOSE POSITION THANK YOU. QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. THE ARTWORK. BOB I JUST DON'T KNOW WHERE WE FIND A REPLACEMENT FOR THE SIX OR SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS THAT THIS BILL PASSES. UNLESS I CONCEDE THAT I DON'T SEE HOW I CAN VOTE FOR IT. THAT THERE'S A SIX TO SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR ESTIMATE FROM THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD WHAT THIS COSTS. IS IT A QUESTION ARE YOU ASKING ME WHERE IT'S COMING FROM HER. IF YOU HAVE ANY. IDEA ON HOW WE MIGHT MAKE UP THAT MONEY. I I KNOW THE GOVERNOR WILL INSIST ON AN APPROPRIATION IN THE BUDGET. WHICH WOULD BE TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY MILLION FOR THIS YEAR SIX HUNDRED MILLION THE NEXT YEAR SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION. HERE. UNLESS WE CAN NEED TO FIND A WAY TO REPLACE IT OR MAKE AN APPROPRIATION IN THE BUDGET. I JUST DON'T SEE HOW THIS BILL. I CAN SUPPORT THIS BILL. WELL. I'D APPRECIATE YOUR CANDOR ON THE BALLOT I KNOW YOU DON'T TYPICALLY SUPPORT BILLS LIKE THIS. SO YOU'RE CERTAINLY NOT. BREAKING WITH HISTORY I JUST WILL SAY THAT. THE MORE WE ENCOURAGE BUSINESSES TO EXAND IN CALIFORNIA THE MORE TAX REVENUE THAT CALIFORNIA WILL SEE AND THE MORE PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING TO WORK THE BETTER THAT IS. FOR CALIFORNIA SO I THINK IT'S EASY FOR US TO GET INTO GOVERNMENT MINDSET OF. M. IF YOU'RE. IF YOU TAKE THIS AMOUNT OF MONEY FROM YOUR CITIZENS. AND THEN YOU STOP TAKING THAT IN MY MONEY DON'T REPLACE IT WITH SOMETHING SOMEHOW THAT'S TAKING MONEY FROM US AND IT'S NOT IT'S TAKING IT FROM THE BUSINESS OWNERS. AND FROM THE EMPLOYEES AND I. AM IT'S JUST A DIFFERENT WAY LOOKING AT IT SO DO I HAVE ANYTHING IDENTIFIED. SPECIFICALLY WHERE A REPLACEMENT. THE GROWTH IN THE BUSINESS SECTOR OF THE ECONOMY PARTICULARLY IN THE SMALLER BUSINESS SECTOR WHO. THE WHEN HE SAYS YOU KNOW HAVE TESTIFIED THAT THIS IS A BIG DEAL FOR THEM NOT MAYBE AS MUCH FOR BIG BUSINESS BUT CERTAINLY FOR SMALL ONE. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER A SOLAR ALLEN I THINK IS A NINETY. LIKE I SAID WE. ZERO ZERO. WATER CO ZERO. WELL I'M TRYING TO BE OPTIMISTIC AND WHAT I CAN ACCOMPLISH HERE TODAY BUT PERHAPS NEXT YEAR THIS BILL GETS THROUGH WE CAN DO THAT. FORCING. ZERO. YOU'RE WELCOME. THANK YOU MISTER ALLEN FOR YOUR OPTIMISM. I. BOB I WOULD LIKE TO SAY I UNDERSTAND THAT OBVIOUSLY THIS BILL HAS A A HIGH HIGH BECAUSE THEY DO ALSO APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT SMALL BUSINESSES STARTING OUT COULD USE ALL THE HELP THEY CAN THEY CAN GET AND THEY ARE OUR LARGEST EMPLOYER SO. WITHOUT WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE UP I WOULD JUST RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR NINE A THINK YOU. ALRIGHT THE MOTION IS. DO PASS AS AMENDED APPROPRIATIONS THE AMENDMENT IS A FIVE YEAR SUNSET. THE COURT WILL BLOW. MUCH AS DO PASSABLY MANAGED TO APPROPRIATIONS PARK BY BURKE AYE BRO. BRO I ALAN. ALLEN AYE BONTA. CHU GRAY MCCARTY. MCCARTY NOT VOTING MELINDA'S. LYNN JUST AYE LIMON.

THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS I'D LIKE TO START OFF BY SAYING FIRST I ACCEPT THE FIVE YEARS SINCE AN AMENDMENT ON THE BILL PER THE COMMITTEE'S REQUEST. I AM PLEASED AT THE PRESENT AB TWENTY THIRTY NINE WHICH WILL PROVIDE A STATE TAX DEDUCTION TO INDIVIDUALS WHO CONTRIBUTE TO CAL ABLE SAVINGS ACCOUNTS BENEFITING INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES. THIS BILL WILL GREG CALIFORNIANS WHO CONTRIBUTE TO CAL ABLE SAVINGS ACCOUNTS A STATE TAX DEDUCTION FOR THE FULL AMOUNT OF THEIR CONTRIBUTION. IN TWENTY FOURTEEN CONGRESS PASSED THE ACHIEVING A BETTER LIFE ACT WHICH ENABLES INDIVIDUALS WITH WITH THIS ABILITIES TO OPEN TAX ADVANTAGE SAVINGS ACCOUNTS. THE PASSAGE OF ABLE RECOGNIZE THE CHALLENGES OF LIVING WITH A DISABILITY AND ASSOCIATED COSTS BY GIVING INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES A BETTER CHANCE AT FINANCIAL INDEPENDENCE NOW YOU SAY OPERATE THEIR OWN ABLE PROGRAMS. AND MANY CALIFORNIANS HAVE ALREADY OPENED ACCOUNTS AND OTHER STATES. IT IS CRITICAL THAT WE OFFER INCENTIVES SO THAT CALIFORNIANS WITH DISABILITIES AND THEIR LOVED ONES CAN CONFIDENTLY CONTRIBUTE TO THEIR OWN FINANCIAL STABILITY AND SECURE BETTER FUTURES. THIS BILL WILL HELP PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES IN THEIR FAMILY'S PREPARE FOR THE FUTURE THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF THESE ACCOUNTS ARE IMPORTANT STEP IN GIVING PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES A CHANCE AT INDEPENDENCE. THIS BILL HAS BROAD SUPPORT INCLUDING THE CALIFORNIA STATE TREASURER JOHN CHIANG AND NINETEEN ORGANIZATIONS IN THE DISABILITY COMMUNITY WITH ME TODAY. TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT IS EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIBER PROGRAM DOT TO ALAN AND DEPUTY EXECUTIVE ACTOR CARRIE FISHER STUFF. WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. GOOD AFTERNOON ON BEHALF OF KELLY WILL I WANNA OFFER SINCERE THANKS TO SOME WOMEN WERE FONG FOR HIS LEADERSHIP IN SUPPORT OF CALLEVA INFERENTIAL DO SAYING. AB TWENTY THIRTY NINE. OF THIS LEGISLATION REPRESENTS A STRONG INCENTIVE FOR FAMILY AND FRIENDS TO PROVIDE ASSISTANCE IN SUPPORT. OF FOR PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. NO WE STRONGLY BELIEVE THAT OF THIS WILL SERVE AS A POWERFUL INCENTIVE. AND AS YOU HEARD FROM THE PREVIOUS TESTIMONY ON TWENTY TWO FIFTY THREE. THAT THIS IS MUCH NEEDED FOR A COMMUNITY THAT IS OFTEN. UNDERSERVED. OFTEN AMONG THE HIGHEST IN UNEMPLOYMENT OR UNDEREMPLOYMENT. AND. EIGHT. TAX. CREDIT FOR FOLKS THAT WOULD SUPPORT. THOSE PEOPLE I THINK IS IS WHAT DO. TO SHOW INNOCENCE IN SUPPORT. HI CONNIE BOYER FRENZEL AGAIN IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL AND I JUST WANNA TELL YOU A FEW REASONS WHY. OF. I WAS A FORMER COUNTY PUBLIC HEALTH NURSE. AND I WILL NOT A HUGUENOT ON MILLIONS OF DOLLARS SO I WANT TO STRETCH THE MONEY OUT THIS WE WILL BILL WORKS BETTER THAN A SPECIAL NEEDS TRUST A SPECIAL NEEDS TRUST. COSTS A LOT TO ADMINISTER TO START UP AND IT WILL ALLOW. PEOPLE WHO CAN ACTUALLY CONTROL THEIR FINANCES MORE IN THE DISABILITY COMMUNITY TO DO THAT THEY CAN TAKE MONEY IN AND OUT. AND IT WILL ALLOW MY SON WHO IS CONSERVED FOR ME TO STRETCH THE MONEY OUT. AND THEN I SAW COMMON IN THERE THAT'S IT WILL MAYBE IT'LL INCOGNITO ONE HELP PEOPLE. SHIRLEY DONATE MORE TO CAL ABLE ABSOLUTELY IF I CAN GET A TAX SLIGHT TAX ADVANTAGE I CAN SPREAD THAT MONEY OUT OVER THE YEARS. AND SO IT JUST MAKES FINANCIAL SENSE BECAUSE AS SAID BEFORE WE DON'T WANT TO SEE OUR CHILDREN ENDING UP INTENSE AND SOME OF THE BAR ALREADY HOMELESS IN SAN FRANCISCO WITH REGIONAL CENTER SUPPORTING THEM SO WE REALLY AS. AS PARENTS AND FAMILY MEMBERS WE NEED SOME HELP NOT ALL OF US ARE MILLIONAIRES THANK YOU. WE HAVE A MOTION FROM ALLEN IN A SECOND FROM BRO. SOMEONE. PLEASE HOPE FOR. ME HERE. COLLEGES. IT EVELYN I'M HAASAN'S INDOLOGISTS AT ABOUT IT WOULD DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA THIS INCENTIVIZE IS CONTRIBUTIONS AND ALLOWS PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES TO HAVE THE MONEY TO SPEND ON THE THEIR MEDICAL NEEDS AND OTHER THINGS. WE ARE VERY STRONG SUPPORT ANNA LOOK FORWARD TO HELPING AS THE BILL MOVES. THINKS. TRUTH ANDERSON ON BEHALF OF THE ARK IN UCP CALIFORNIA COLLABORATION AND SUPPORT. VERY GETTING WITH CALIFORNIA DISABILITY SERVICES ASSOCIATION AND SUPPORT. IF A FOOTBALL THE FROM THE AUTISM BUSINESS ASSOCIATION. STRONG SUPPORT AND ALSO FROM BEHAVIORAL INTERVENTION ASSOCIATION WORKING WITH OUR CHILDREN TALK TO THEM A FOUNDER OF THIS NONPROFIT. HE SERVED BOTH CHILDREN AND FRESNO COUNTY IN THE BAY AREA AND MANY MANY OF THE FAMILIES WE HAVE SERVED WOULD. SINCERELY. BE OVERJOYED BY THIS BILL THANK YOU SO MUCH. MELISSA CORTES ROTH ON BEHALF OF AUTISM SPEAKS AND THE CENTER FOR AUTISM AND RELATED DISORDERS IN SUPPORT. HI AGAIN MY NAME IS JAN WARREN. I REALLY LIKE TO SUPPORT THIS BILL. BECAUSE AFTER MY HUSBAND AND I ARE GONE. BOTH OF US BEING IN OUR SEVENTIES SUNKEN TO BE THAT LONG. OUR SON'S DO HAVE A SPECIAL NEEDS TRUST. BUT THAT'S A VERY EXPENSIVE SITUATION AND EVERY TIME HE WITHDRAWS MONEY IT MAY AFFECT HIS SAYS SECURITY. AND HIS MEDICAID WITCHY BOTH OF THEM DESPERATELY NEED BECAUSE THEY HAVE DUAL DIAGNOSIS. A WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THEM EVEN AFTER WORK ON. WE HAVE TO SUPPORT THEM UNTIL THEY'RE GONE. AND THAT'S THAT'S A VERY BIG WORRY FIRST FOR US AS PARENTS. THANK YOU. WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. DOT QUIRK. SO BOB I CERTAINLY I RESPECT THE NEEDS OF THE. COMMUNITY. UNFORTUNATELY WITH THIS BILL DOES IS GIVES THE PATH THEY MOST OF THE BENEFIT TO THE PEOPLE WHO MAKE THE MOST MONEY. AND ALMOST NO BENEFIT TO PEOPLE WHO MAKE VERY LITTLE MONEY. IF YOU'RE MAKING. FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND A YEAR FOR EXAMPLE YOU GET TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS BACK. BUT IF YOU'RE MAKING A MILLION DOLLARS YEAR YOU GET THIRTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS BACK. SO THE DIFFICULTY HERE IS SIMPLY THAT MOST OF THE BENEFIT GOES TO THE HIGHER INCOME OWNERS. I WOULD RESPECT ABILITY THE SAME PRICE SIX MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR ROUGHLY. IF IT. GAVE MOST OF THE MONEY TO THE PEOPLE WHO MADE LESS MONEY. AND NO MONEY TO ANYONE WHO SAY MADE MORE THAN FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND YEAR. UNDER THIS SPELL SOMEBODY MAKING FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND HERE WOULD GET THE TEN TEN PERCENT OR TEN THOUSAND DOLLAR. IT'S YOU MEAN NAY DAY. SAVE THE FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND THEY COULD GET A TEN THOUSAND DOLLAR BENEFIT. I JUST DON'T THINK THAT'S EQUITABLE. BUT AGAIN IF YOU COULD COME BACK WITH THE BILL WHERE MOST OF THE MONEY WENT O LOW INCOME INNER EARNERS I COULD CERTAINLY SUPPORT IT THANK YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. JUDGE BECAUSE I WOULD WHICH IS ONLY A HOLLOW ONCE AGAIN. MISTER BONTA KEY SPEAKING MR MCCARTY IS A MICROPHONE FOR RIGHT NOW. SURE. JUST A A CLARIFYING QUESTION ARE THERE ANY OTHER AREAS WHERE WE GIVE SORT OF THAT THAT THE DOUBLE TAX. ADVANTAGE. THAT'S BEING PROPOSED HERE AND AND. MY UNDERSTANDINGS THAT THAT THAT'S A LITTLE BIT UNIQUE ARE MAYBE UNPRECEDENTED. AND ALSO. WHAT IS THE BEHAVIORAL CHANGE? THAT YOU ANTICIPATE WHAT WILL HAPPEN BECAUSE OF THIS BILL THAT WHAT WHAT ARE PEOPLE NOT DOING BUT BECAUSE OF YOUR BILL TO ALL THE STUDY BE. INCENTIVE TO DO OR WILL START DOING. BUT WE CERTAINLY WANT A SET OF FIVE AS MANY CALIFORNIANS TO SAVE. AS POSSIBLE FOR THE SPECIALLY FOR THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS. WHO ARE WHO HAVE WHO HAVE NEEDS? DO THEIR DISABILITIES. SO IF IT DID THE DOUBLE TAXATION ARGUMENT AYE AYE IS IS IS THE ONE THAT'S OUT THERE BUT WHEN WE ONE INCENTIVIZE NOT ONLY JUST INDIVIDUAL BUT THEIR FAMILIES AS WELL SO. THE I THE UNCLE THE MOTHER THE FATHER THEY DON'T THEY DON'T GET A DEDUCTION AT THE MOMENT SO HOW WE WON INCENTIVIZE THOSE INDIVIDUALS TO SAVE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE FOR THE FUTURE OF THEIR CHILDREN. OR FAMILY MEMBERS. I WOULD ALSO ADD TO THAT THAT THERE IS A. THE VET. THEY'RE TWO SIDES TO THIS SO THERE'S THAT TAX ADVANTAGE PORTION FOR THE BENEFICIARY SO IT LOOKS THAT. VERB THAT EARNINGS ON INTEREST FROM INVESTMENTS. AT THAT IS RELATIVELY. THAT MAYBE RARE IN MOST CASES THE WAY THAT THAT ABLE ACCOUNTS WORK THEY'RE VERY TRANSACTIONAL. AND SO MOST MANY FOLKS WHO USE IT MAY NOT INVEST FOR LONG TERM EARNINGS ON THAT SO. BUT EVEN IF THEY DID THAT BENEFIT WOULD GO TO THE BENEFICIARY THE OWNER OF THE ACCOUNT WHEREAS FOR THIS BILL IT LOOKS AT THE PEOPLE WHO ARE CONTRIBUTING FOR THE ACCOUNT. AND SO WE WANT TO INCENTIVIZE THOSE INDIVIDUALS TO CONTRIBUTE. REALLY FOR THE INDEPENDENCE AND WELL BEING. OF THE BENEFICIARY. UP TO A CLOSE. I SUSPECT WE ASK RIVA. AND THE ACTUAL TO PASS AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS THE AMENDMENT IS TO ADD A FIVE YEAR SUNSET ARE YOU ACCEPTING THAT I ACCEPT THAT ARE OPEN AND THE CLERK WILL CALL THE ROLL. BURKE AYE BURKE AYE GROW. GROW AYE ALLEN. ALLEN AYE BONTA. BONTA ONLY TO. CHU I GRAY AYE GRAY AYE MCCARTY. PRETTY AYE MELINDA'S. LENDERS ARE A LOW MOAN.

WILL GREATLY ASSIST OUR DISABLED VETERAN POPULATION. CURRENTLY CALIFORNIA OFFERS A BASIC PROPERTY TAX BENEFIT FOR DISABLED VETERANS COULD DISABILITY RATING ONE HUNDRED PERCENT FROM THE US DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS. THE CURRENT EXEMPTION FROM PROPERTY TAXES ON THAT PART OF THE FULL VALUE OF THE RESIDENTS THE DOES NOT EXCEED ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS. THIS EXEMPTION AFFORDED TO DISABLED VETERANS IS HELPFUL. AT THE VETERANS PROPERTY IS A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS OR LOWER IN VALUE. UNFORTUNATELY HOMES ARE NOT A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS OR LOWER VALUE IN FACT. THE AVERAGE CALIFORNIA HOME COST FIVE HUNDRED TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND THAT WAS FIVE YEARS AGO. EACH YEAR THIS COST CONTINUES TO RISE. IT'S CRITICAL WE SUPPORT OUR BRAVE VETERANS WHO HAVE SACRIFICED THEIR LIVELIHOODS IN SOME CASES THEIR VERY LIVES. WHAT PROTECTING OUR COUNTRY?

WE SEE ANOTHER GROUP COME OVER IN OPPOSITION THEY'VE OPPOSED A NUMBER OF BILLS SAY THE NAME OF THE GROUP IS THE CALIFORNIA TAX REFORM ASSOCIATION. YEAH LET THE RECORD STATE VERY CLEARLY. THAT ONE WOULD IMAGINE THAT A TAX REFORM ASSOCIATION WOULD BE ALL IN FAVOR OF REFORMING TAXES AND LOWERING THEM IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BECAUSE WE DO PAY AMONG THE VERY HIGHEST TAX IN THE NATION. THE HIGH SALES TAX HIKES PERSONAL INCOME TAX AS YOU WELL KNOW AMONG THE HIGHEST GAS TAX NOT AMONG THE HIGHEST CORPORATE TAXES AS WELL WE'VE SEEN A NUMBER OF TAX BREAKS COME THROUGH THIS COMMITTEE TODAY. AND ALSO BREAKS TO SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS AND AT EVERY JUNCTURE THIS CALIFORNIA TAX REFORM ASSOCIATION HAS BEEN ADVOCATING FOR ANYTHING BUT REFORM THEY'VE ADVOCATING FOR HIGHER TAXES.
