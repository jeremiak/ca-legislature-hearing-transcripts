MORNING I'M GONNA GO AHEAD AND CALL THE OVERSEE HEARING OF THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE AUDIT COMMITTEE TO ORDER TODAY WILL BE DISCUSSING THE FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS IDENTIFIED BY THE STATE AUDITOR THE AUDIT REPORT RELEASED IN NOVEMBER TITLED K. THROUGH TWELVE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA THE STATE'S APPROACH HAS NOT INSURED THAT SIGNIFICANT FUNDING IS BENEFITING STUDENTS AS INTENDED. TO CLOSE ACHIEVEMENT GAPS ORDER THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER OR WHATEVER AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER QUIRK SILVA FOR REQUESTING THE ON IT- WITH NEARLY SIX MILLION STUDENTS IN THE K. THROUGH TWELVE GRADE LEVELS AND POP SCHOOLS THE STATE BY. THE END OF DAHLE. CALIFORNIA'S IMPLEMENTED THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA OR ELSE EFF AS IT IS KNOWN WHICH SIMPLIFIES THE WAY THE STATE PAYS FOR SCHOOLS DIRECTING. ADDITIONAL MONEY TO DISTRICTS WITH HIGH PROPORTIONS OF INTENDED STUDENT GROUPS UNDER THIS CURRENT SYSTEM THE STATE DISTRIBUTES MONEY TO DISTRICTS THERE'S THREE SEPARATE BUCKETS. BASED FUNDS THAT ALL DISTRICTS RECEIVE BASED ON STUDENT ATTENDANCE. AND ADDITIONAL CONCENTRATION AND SUPPLEMENTAL FUNDS THAT DISTRICTS RECEIVE BASED ON THEIR PROPORTION OF STUDENTS WHO ARE LOW INCOME ENGLISH LEARNERS ARE FOSTER YOUTH. OVERALL CALIFORNIA SCHOOL DISTRICTS RECEIVED 90% OF THE MORE THAN SIXTY TWO BILLION. THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION A PORTION THROUGH LC FF IN FISCAL YEAR TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN. ABOUT NINE BILLION OF THAT SIXTY TWO BILLION CONSISTED OF SUPPLEMENTAL IN CONCENTRATION FUNDS. ACCORDING TO THIS ON THE STATE'S APPROACH TO ELSE EFF HAS. ENSURE FUNDING IS BENEFITING INTENDED STUDENT GROUP CLOSING THE ACHIEVEMENT GAPS. DOT ALSO. BUILT POLICY BIGGER AND STAY ORDERS LACK ADEQUATE IF. TO TEST THE IMPACT OF SUB TOLL AND CONCENTRATE FUND ON THE- OUTCOMES OF THE INTO STUDENT. HOPEFULLY THIS HEARING WILL FOR US THE MEN ON HOW BEST TO ENSURE THAT FUNDS ARE BE A LEAD ALEX PROGRAM OUT IT. TO THE INTO THE AND- TO THE GROUP AND HOW TO MAKE SURE THAT. IF ANYONE WOULD LIKE A COPY OF THAT- PLEASE CONTACT THE- JOINT LEGISLATIVE AUDIT COMMITTEE STAFF FOR A COPY OF THAT STATEMENT- WE DO EXPECT SINCE- THE GOVERNOR'S ADMINISTRATION WAS NOT ABLE TO ATTEND TODAY THAT THEY WILL BE ADDRESSING THESE ISSUES. AND WE EXPECT TO SEE SOME OF THE IMPLEMENTATION FROM THE AUDIT REPORT TO BE SEEN IN PERHAPS- BUDGET TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE. NOW WITH THAT I WILL GO AHEAD AND- ASK IF ANYBODY ELSE WOULD LIKE TO MAKE OPENING COMMENTS. I DON'T REMEMBER WEBER PLEASE YES PLEASE- THANK YOU VERY MUCH I WANT TO THANK THE TEAR IN THE MEMBERS HERE OF THE- AUDIT COMMITTEE FOR UP SCHEDULING THIS HEARING TODAY- I THINK- IT'S AN EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO HEARING IS. AS MOST OVERSIGHT HEARINGS ARE WITH REGARDS TO THE OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS LEGISLATORS TO OF TO MAKE SURE THAT THE RESOURCES THAT WE HAVE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA GOING IN THE PLACES WHERE WE THINK THEY SHOULD GO. IF THERE'S SOME SENSE OF RESPONSIBILITY FOR DOING THAT I DON'T THINK THE CHAIR FOR HOSTING THIS IMPORTANT. MEETING ACCOUNTABILITY MATTERS TO THE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF CHILDREN IN CALIFORNIA WERE NOT GETTING THE EDUCATION THAT THEY NEED OR THAT THEY DESERVE- UNFORTUNATELY THE AUDITOR AND HER TEAM OF INVESTIGATORS HAVE DONE AN EXCELLENT JOB WITH THEY HAVE CONFIRMED. WHAT MY FEARS WERE FROM BEGIN. MANY PER MEMBER SIX AS SIX YEARS AGO WAS WE START LCF HALF. IN THAT DISCUSS WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND OTHERS WASN'T DISK. THE COUNTY. I USED IT TO THEM. YOU COULD NOT. AND NOT A WHOLE THEM ACCOUNTABLE BECAUSE AT MY WILL NOT GET TO THE CHIU THAT IT OF THE GOVERNOR I WAS. OF TOO CONCERNED ABOUT IT NICKEL DIE AND PAY THAT CAME INTO THIS AND WHAT WAS GOING AND SO HE PROBLEM WAS THAT WE WOULD HAVE ACCOUNTABILITY WE WOULD HAVE THE ABILITY MEASURE AND THAT WE HAD REGIONALLY HAVE PUT IT INTO THE LEAD INTO THE PIECE OF LEGISLATION- WHICH WAS THEN TAKEN OUT. AND KICKED OVER TO THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION AND IT BEEN SO YEARS AND WOULD STILL LOOKING THAT ACCOUNT. MY GREATEST FEARS CAME WHEN I WENT FROM DISTRICT TO DISTRICT IN SAN DIEGO NOT ONLY IN SENATE COUNTY BUT IN THE OTHER EAR IN AT THE CRITIC QUESTION. WHAT IS HAPPENING. IS NINE FOR THE CHILDREN TO CLOSE IT. GAP I NEVER GOT A GOOD CHANCE. WANTED TO I THINK ONE DISTRICT ACTUALLY TOLD ME WHAT THE HOW MUCH THEY GOT. AND WHAT THEY DID WITH IT. WE'VE EVEN HAD HERE. AT THE CAPITAL WITH THE- FINANCE DEPARTMENT. AND ASK THE CRITICAL QUESTION HOW MUCH MONEY ARE WE GIVING FOR THE OF THOSE PARTICULAR GRANTS. THEY CLAIM THEY COULDN'T TELL US THEY DID NOT KNOW THE NUMBERS. SAID YOU MEAN YOU WRITE CHECKS AND YOU DON'T KNOW WHO YOU WRITE THEM TO. AND THEY SAID WELL NOT REALLY ACID BUT IF YOU DO THEN YOU SHOULD BE FIRED BECAUSE YOU'RE IN CONFLICT. NO SHOULD HAVE A RIGHT TO CHECK NOT KNOW WHOSE RECEIVING THAT CHECK. AND THOSE ARE THE KINDS OF CONVERSATIONS WE'VE HAD FOR THE LAST SIX YEARS AROUND THIS ISSUE OF ELLE CFM. AFTER MUCH FRUSTRATION OF TRYING TO WRITE LEGISLATION TO GET ACCOUNTABILITY. AND HAVING IT HELPED IN COMMITTEE AND HAVING IT BE TELL BY THE GOVERNOR TOP. IT BECAME A- TO ME THE I ONLY. WAS BEST. YOU'LL SEE A- I KNEW AT THAT BUT WE WERE BASS. DETERMINE WHETHER NOW THE MONEY GOING TO CHILDREN IT SHOULD GO TO. SO I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO THE CONVERSE. TODAY I PRE THE RIVER. THAT BEEN DONE. AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO HOPEFULLY MAKING SURE THAT WHAT WE DID WITH LCF AFTER THOSE DOLLARS. THAT WOULD TRULY DESIGNED TO HELP THOSE CHILDREN WAS STRUGGLING IN THE STATE. THAT WE SOMEHOW ANOTHER GET TO THE POINT WITH THAT WAS DOLLARS GO TO THOSE CHILDREN. AND THAT WE CAN FIND A TALK ABOUT. IMAGE GAP WITH SOME OF THE PROGRAM AND- IS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WANT TO THANK YOU FOR APPEARING IN BANK ARE. I WILL HAVE. THANK YOU MISS WEBER WILL BRING FROM ASSEMBLY WOMAN FOR SILVA. GOOD MORNING AM AS MEMBER SHARE QUIRK RIP NORTH OR CAN'T. BUT ALSO A CLASSROOM TEACHER FOR THIRTY YEARS AND AS I WAS. UP HERE BEGINNING IN TWENTY TWELVE AND THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA WAS BEING DISCUSSED I DISTINCTLY REMEMBER BEING IN A MEETING WITH THE GOVERNOR'S TEAM AT THAT TIME GOVERNOR BROWN AND DOCTOR WEBER AND THERE WERE SEVERAL OF US AS WE WERE EDUCATORS BEING. THE TOP TWO ABOUT HOW THIS MIGHT LOOK IN THE FUTURE OF ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I ALWAYS REMEMBER IS DISTRICT WORK CONSTANTLY TALKING ABOUT THEY WANTED MORE FLEXIBILITY. THEY WANT TO BE ABLE TO USE THE MONEY THE LOCAL LEVEL AS THEY THOUGHT IT WOULD BE- BEST FIT FOR THEIR PARTICULAR DISTRICTS AND I DO REMEMBER MY COLLEAGUE ARE YOU MIGHT NOT REMEMBER SAYING- THE A B. MINUS LOOK CONTROL FUND FOR. IS BY AID ABOUT WHETHER A TRIAL IS LEARN TO READ BASS BALANCING ABOUT UNITS THAT BUT I ALL OUR BIKE A TRAIN OR WHATEVER WHERE THEY COULD DO THEIR THE STANDARD WOULD BE THAT WE WILL GET THE ARE SO TO RE AGES A IT WAS. IT WAS REALLY GIVING A NOD TO THE DISTRICTS REGARDING- WE WON'T WE TRUST YOU THERE'S A DIFFERENT WAY TO FUND OUR SCHOOLS AND SO THAT MOVE FORWARD- BUT I'VE BEEN IN THE CLASSROOM. FOR THIRTY YEARS IN A VERY HIGH ACHIEVING DISTRICT FULLER TO AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL DISTRICT AND ALL MY FOUR KIDS HAVE ATTENDED THOSE DISTRICTS SO I HAVE A HIGH REGARD FOR PUBLIC EDUCATION. BUT THE TRUTH OF IT IS THAT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE SUPPLEMENT GRANTS RELATED TO OUR E. L. LEARNERS RELATED TO FOSTER KIDS IN OUR LOW SOCIAL ECONOMIC- STUDENTS. WE CONTINUE TO SEE A MAJOR ISSUE BETWEEN EQUALITY AND EQUITY. AND I HAVE SEEN FIRST HAND DISTRICT AFTER DISTRICT SCHOOL BOARD MEMBER AFTER SCHOOL BOARD MEMBER AND PARENTS WHO HAVE A VERY VERY DIFFICULT TIME AND EVEN BEFORE THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA IT WOULD BE RELATED TO TITLE ONE FUNDS LIKE WHY DOES THAT SCHOOL GET TITLE ONE FUNDS. AND WE DON'T SO AT THE VERY BASIC LEVEL PERRANCE MANY TIMES ADMINISTRATORS AND TEACHERS FEEL THAT THAT'S UNFAIR BUT WHEN WE ADDED THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA THAT IT WAS OKAY WE GET THIS MUCH MONEY AND THE FIRST THING WE HEARD FROM MANY DISTRICTS WAS. WAIT THE NUMBERS ARE WRONG WE SHOULD BE GETTING MORE BECAUSE WE HAVE. MORE STUDENTS A AND IT'S NOT FAIR BUT THEN ONCE THE MONEY WAS STARTING TO BE USED. IT WAS WELL OVER GET X. AMOUNT OF MONEY IF WE PUT A READING SPECIALIST AT EVERY SCHOOL THAT EVERYBODY GETS TO HAVE THAT READING SPECIALISTS AND THAT'S EQUAL RIGHT. BUT THE TRUTH IS SOME SCHOOLS NEED THREE OR FOUR READING INTERVENTION SPECIALIST BECAUSE THEY HAVE THE HIGH NUMBER OF STUDENTS IN THAT. CATEGORY AND OTHER SCHOOLS MAY NEED ONE OR NOT EVEN ONE BUT DISTRICTS AND ADMINISTRATORS AND SUPERINTENDENTS ARE HAVING A VERY HARD TIME MAKING THAT DECISION BECAUSE IT SEEMS ON EQUAL. AND THE TRUTH IS YES IF STUDENTS QUALIFY FOR THOSE FUNDS THEY SHOULD GET MORE. AND THAT IS WHERE WE HAVE THIS EQUITY ANY QUALITY ISSUE AND IT JUST HAPPENS ALL THE TIME WELL WE'RE HIRING A P. ET COACH THIS ISGOOD FOR EVERYBODY. BUT THOSE FUNDS ARE INTENDED TO INCREASE THE ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT OF THOSE SUBGROUPS AND THAT'S WHY I. ASK THE AUDITOR ALONG WITH MY COLLEAGUE- THAT I WANTED TO SEE HOW THESE FUNDS WERE BEING USED I CAN GIVE MANY EXAMPLES WHERE THESE FUNDS ARE BEING USED FOR EXTRAORDINARY THINGS. BUT IS IT CHANGING HOW THE STUDENTS IN THESE CATEGORIES ARE ACHIEVING AND WE HAVEN'T SEEN THAT. I'M NOT SAYING THAT GROWTH YES WE SEE SOME OF OUR ACHIEVEMENT MOVE UP AND THEN WE SEE THE OTHER STUDENTS MOVE UP AS WELL SO WE'RE NOT CLOSING THAT SOME PEOPLE HAVE EVEN GONE AS FAR. AS SAYING TO ME WE'RE NEVER GONNA CHANGE CLOSE IT. WE JUST HOW CAN WAY. AND TO ME THAT'S NOT ACCEPTABLE SO I LOOK FORWARD TO THE HEARINGAND A BOMB. THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU LEAVE US SENATE WAR JUST HAS A OPENING STATEMENT AS WELL HOPEFULLY BRIEF. NEARLY BRIEF THANK THANK YOU CHAIRMAN I JUST WANTED TO- THANK YOU FOR ALL IN THOSE WHO PARTICIPATE IN MAKING THIS THIS AUDIT HAPPEN I THINK IT'S ALWAYS HELPFUL. WHEN WE- I TAKE A DEEP DIVE INTO INTO TOP TO SPECIALLY EDUCATION I'M A FATHER OF TWO YOUNG BOYS IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL I AM NOW GETTING VERY WELL VERSED IN TITLE ONE IN IN THE EDUCATION PROCESS BUT I'M STILL VERY MUCH NO IN THE LEARNING PHASE. I DO WANT TO- JUST MAKE A COMMENT THAT. AS WE GO THROUGH AND THE SCHOOLS ARE AUDITED OR AS THE PROCESS MOVES FORWARD- THAT. THE REPORT AS IT COMES OUT POINT IN I. IDENTIFY THAT WALL SCHOOLS MAY HAVE BEEN PICKED. SPECIFIC REASONS. ARE THERE PRACTICES COULD VERY WELL BE ON UTILIZED BY OTHER DISTRICT THROUGHOUT THE STATE. THE THING IS IT POOR DESIGN. SCHOOL ARE PICKED A ON AFTER WERE LIKE THE AS THOUGH THE MAY BE ON. AND I THINK WHAT WE'RE GOING TO FIGHT IS THAT THERE SOME TO OF MUCH LARGER PATTERNS IN IN IN SYSTEMS OF OPERATION SO ALL LEAVE THAT FOR THE- THE AUDITOR AND- THE FOLLOWING- THE FOLLOWING A REPORT. BUT FLEXIBILITY AT THE LOCAL CONTROL LEVEL I THINK IS A CENTRAL I THINK WE MUST CONTINUE THAT AND I LOOK FORWARD TO WANT TO HEARING WHAT EVERYONE HAS TO SAY TODAY THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATOR RIGHT HERE IN SINGAPORE OPENING COMMENTS I'M SORRY ONE WAS YOU CAN SAY CONVENES IN. O'CLOCK OR HEARINGS WILL LET YOU KNOW THAT. ALL RIGHT WELL. HEARING AND SEE MORE WAS THE RELAY WOULD LIKE TO MAKE AN COM. YOU'RE GOOD ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT THANK VERY MUCH SO WITH THAT LET'S GO TO GET STARTED LET ME THANK OF ALL THE MEMBERS OF HERE AT ON TIME CENTER THIS AS A MORE LOCKS MEMBER I'VE WAS. ONE OF THE FIRST ONES HERE- SOME WOMAN QUIRK SILVA ASSEMBLY MEMBER WEBER SENATOR GONZALEZ AND pOFFER BEING HEROES WITH THAT LET'S GO AHEAD AND GET STARTED WITH THE FIRST PANEL THE OVERVIEW THE AUDIT FINDINGS RECOMMENDATIONS WE HAVE OUR STEAMED STATE AUDITOR ELAINE HOW- DEL CARL CARLSON PRINCE WATER JORDAN RIGHT SENIOR AUDITOR. AND THAT LET ME JUST SAY JUST BASED OFF EVERYONE'S OPENING COMMENTS OBVIOUSLY THERE'S A SENSE OF FRUSTRATION I BELIEVE FROM LEGISLATURE FROM SOME OF THE MEMBERS WANTING SOME INCREASED ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY ALL THE DISCUSSIONS WE DID HAVE ABOUT THE L. C. F. F. AT ITS INTENDED GROUPS ONE OF THE MAIN. WE HAD THE LC IF TO HELP THESE GROUPS AND THERE'S A LEVEL FIRST THAT'S HAPPENING SO I MET MATTER WHEN YOUR PLEASE THE YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- MEMBERS FOR THE RECORD MY NAME'S ELAINE HOW ON THE CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR WITH ME IS JORDAN MISTER RIGHT THE AUDIT SUPERVISOR EXPERT TO PROJECT AND- MR CARTOONS NOT AVAILABLE. HE'S STILL WHAT BILLABLE COME TO HEARING BUT MR TO WRITE IS SAM ABSOLUTELY FOR CAPABLE OF STE YOU THROUGH THE DOCKING. FOR WHAT LAUNCH INTO AND OUT THAT GYM PROVIDED TO I'M WOULD LIKE TO JUST DO A VERY HIGH LEVEL OVERVIEW AND THEN I'M MR RIGHT CAN YOUTH AND STE. ARE FOR EACH D. IF WE I UP AS DOCTOR AND QUIRK IN WE WERE AT DOING AN AVAIL EFFECTS. TO THREE SCHOOL TRICKS SIMPLY LOOK BOARD OF EDUCATION BECAUSE THERE IS. RATED L. TEMPLATE AND OTHER IT'S A LITTLE BIT WORK THE PAGE AS WELL AND LOOKING AT THE DASH AND OUTCOMES IN HOUSE OF THESE. IN. THREE KEY ISSUE AREAS THE FIRST IS RELATED TO FUNDING- AND AS SOME OF THE OPENING COMMENTS. MENTIONED ARE THE CONCLUSIONS IN THE REPORT IS THAT THE STATE HAS NOT INSURED THAT DISTRICTS ARE SPENDING SUPPLEMENTAL IN CONCENTRATION FUNDS THOSE FUNDS THAT WERE SPECIFICALLY PROVIDED TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS FOR THOSE AS WE REFER TO THEM INTENDED STUDENTS ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS YOUTH IN FOSTER CARE AND INDIVIDUALS FROM HOUSE WITH LOW INCOME SO THOSE THREE GROUPS. IS REALLY WHAT THE SUPPLEMENT CONCERT CAN FUNDING WAS PRIMARILY ALLOCATED FOR AN AND THE STATE IS NOT ENSURING THAT THAT MONEY IS BEING SPENT FOR THOSE STUDENTS AND SO THOSE STUDENTS ARE NOT BENEFITING FROM THAT MONEY. AND THE SECOND AREA I THOUGHT THE ALL CAPS THE LOCAL CONTROL AND DANCE. AND WHEN WE- THOSE. AT THE- IS THE PLANS ARE NOT PROVIDING THE AND ABILITY TO CALL CAN. TO STAKE. PARENTS ARE IN THE COMMUNITY PARENTS OF STUDENTS GOING TO THOSE PARTICULAR SCHOOLS HOW EFFECTIVELY THOSE DISTRICTS ARE PROVIDING SERVICES TO THOSE INTENDED STUDENTS. AND THEN THE THIRD MAJOR CATEGORIES OUTCOMES WE CERTAINLY AS A STATE WANT TO BE ABLE TO TIE FUNDING TO OUTCOMES AND AS MS QUIRK SILVA TRY TO CLOSE THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP AND- INCREASE THE ACHIEVEMENT OF THESE THESE PARTICULAR STUDENTS. AND UNFORTUNATELY WHAT WE FOUND IS THERE IS THERE ISN'T A LINK BETWEEN THERE ISN'T A DIRECT LINK BETWEEN THE FUNDING THAT IS BEING PROVIDED TO THE DISTRICTS. AND THE DASHBOARD THAT THAT THE DEPARTMENT EDUCATION LAUNCH JUST A FEW YEARS AGO. SO THOSE ARE THE THREE BIG BIG BUCKETS THAT WE'LL BE TALKING ABOUT TODAY I WILL STEP YOU THROUGH VERY QUICKLY AT A HIGH LEVEL IS A AND THE INTEREST OF TIME I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT. CAN GET TO THE HAND. BUT I'M FUNDING THEY SAID STATE DOES X. REQUIRE DISTRICTS TO SPEND THEIR ALL OF THEIR SUPPLEMENTAL CONCENTRATION FUNDING FOR THESE INTENDED STUDENT GROUPS. ANOTHER ISSUE THAT WE IDENTIFY IS IF A DISTRICT DOESN'T SPEND ALL THEIR SUPPLEMENTAL IN CONCENTRATION FUNDING IN ONE YEAR. IN THE NEXT YEAR. OF THE DEATHS WERE YOU DOING THAT AS BASE FOR IT DID NOT MAINTAIN ITS ITS IDENTITY. AS SUPPLEMENTAL CONCENTRATION FUNDING SO WE HAD CONCERT WITH THAT AND MADE SOME RECOMMENDATIONS RELATED TO THAT SUBSTANTIALLY AS WE CONCLUDE AND REPORT WITH THE STATE HAS CREATED A MECHANISM PROVIDE ADDITIONAL FUNDS FOR SPECIFIC DEEPENS. BUT NOT A CAN IS TO BE ABLE TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT THAT FUNDING IS ACTIVE IS BE USED BRIT. AND IS A FOR IN. PORT AU SO THE KIDS. YOU KNOW. BUT SHE AB IN THEIR CHIEF LEVEL. WHEN WE LOOK AT THE EL CAPS. WITH RESPECT TO FUNDING WHY WE SAT FOUND IS BUT IN THE- IN FOR. RELATED TO SUPPLEMENTAL CONCENTRATION FUNDS WAS NOT ALWAYS TRANSPARENT. WHAT ARE STAFF AND JORDAN WILL TALK TO ABOUT THIS LITTLE BIT IS WE ACTUALLY HAD TO GO INTO THOSE ALL CAPS. AND LOOK IN VARIOUS AREAS OF THESE VOLUMINOUS L. CAPS HUNDREDS OF PAGES TO FIND ALL OF THE BUDGET INFORMATION ALL OF THE EXPENDITURE INFORMATION TO BE ABLE TO COME UP WITH A SUMMARY. OF SUPPLEMENTAL IN CONCENTRATION TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IT ALL SPENT WHAT WAS IT SPENT ON. AND WE HAVE RECOMMENDATIONS. IN THE REPORT AGAIN RELATED TO MORE TRANSPARENCY AND MAKING THOSE EL CAPS MORE STREAMLINED. AND ALLOWING PEOPLE THE ABILITY TO UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS BUDGET WHAT WAS SPENT IS THERE MONEY LEFT OVER AND BEING ABLE TO HOLD SCHOOL DISTRICTS ACCOUNTABLE FOR USING THAT MONEY IN THE FIVE SUBSEQUENT YEAR. FOR THE INTENDED STUDENT GROUPS. SO THOSE ARE THE ARE SOME OF THE ISSUE RELATED TO FUND. THE LOCAL CONTROL ACCOUNTABILITY THE L. CAPS A OUR OUR PRIMER CONCLUDE ON THIS IS THE INFORMATION IN THESE CAL CAPS IT'S OVERLY COMPLEX ON THESE EL CAPS ARE LONG THE LUMINOUS DOCUMENTS THEY REALLY NEED TO BE STREAMLINED- AND WHAT WE FOUND IS THERE WERE THERE WERE A VARIETY OF GOALS AND THE ALL CAPS AND THEN. NUMEROUS SERVICES. UNDERNEATH THOSE PARTICULAR GOALS BUT WE WEREN'T SEEING A LINK BETWEEN THAT AND THE ACTUAL EXPENDITURE SO IT'S REALLY OBSCURING. THE ABILITY REALLY MAKING IT DIFFICULT FOR STAKEHOLDERS OR ANYONE TO UNDERSTAND EXACTLY WHAT A SCHOOL DISTRICT IS DOING AND BEING ABLE TO HOLD THAT SCHOOL DISTRICTS ACCOUNTABLE TO PROPER USE OF THOSE FUNDS. SO WE HAD SOME SOME RECOMMENDATIONS WITH RESPECT TO THAT ARE CERTAINLY WE ARE UNDER IN THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION WORKING ON STREAM AND DO SOME. RISE OF THE EL CAP AND WE THINK THAT STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTORY BUT WE ALSO THINK THAT THERE ARE MORE NEEDS TO BE DONE WITH RESPECT TO THAT SO I'M GONNA STOP THEIR STARS THE ALL CAPS AND LET AGAIN JORDAN TALK ABOUT THAT A LITTLE BIT. AND THEN OUT COMES WE WERE REALLY LOOKING FOR LET. PAINT AND TING THE L. CAP NO THAT FOR THERE IS A AN ACT IS NOT THANK BETWEEN. MY DISTRICT IS. THERE AND SINGLE MONIES IN AND IS THAT ULTIMATELY ACHIEVE AN OUTCOME. SO FOR A- IF A- YOU RECEIVED AMOUNT OF FUNDING FOR A SLANG LEARNERS. AND THEY HIRE. AND THAT'S SERVICE THAT THE PER. TO THOSE STUDENTS WE YOU GET TO THE DASH. YOU ARE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO TELL. THE FUNDING THAT THAT DISTRICT SPENT ON THOSE TUTORS. SUCH RESULTED IN INCREASED ACHIEVEMENT FOR ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS BECAUSE IT GETS. IT GETS ROLLED UP INTO AN OVERALL GOAL SO IT'S NOT SPECIFIC TO THAT SERVICE OR THAT PARTICULAR TUTOR AND WE THINK THERE NEEDS TO BE A DIRECT CONNECTION BETWEEN. WHAT ARE WE SPENDING THE MONEY AT THE DISTRICT SPENDING THE MONEY ON. AND WHAT ULTIMATELY IS THE OUTCOME SO YOU CAN MEASURE OVER TIME NOW THE DASHBOARD WAS LAUNCHED IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN LCF IT'S BEEN AROUND FOR LONGER THAN THAT START IN FISCAL YEAR THIRTEEN FOURTEEN. SO WE ONLY HAVE AS A STATE A COUPLE OF YEARS OF INFORMATION BUT WE CERTAINLY BELIEVE THERE'S AN OPPORTUNE TIME NOW. TO MAKE SOME CHANGES TO THE REQUIREMENTS TO ALLOW. STAKEHOLDERS THE LEGISLATURE THE PUBLIC TO BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND HOW THIS MONEY IS BEING INVESTED AND IS IT TRULY BENEFITING THE STUDENTS THESE INTENDED STUDENTS. ARE AND IS IT RESULTING IN OUTCOMES THAT ARE SHOWING IMPROVEMENT AND pACHIEVEMENT GAP SO WE NEED TO SEE AN ALIGNMENT BETWEEN EXPENDITURES AND OUTCOMES AND WITH THAT THAT DOES NOT EXIST RIGHT NOW WE THINK THERE IS A SOLUTION. WE THINK IT'S A FEASIBLE REASONABLE SOLUTION- TO BE ABLE TO GET THERE- AND AGAIN AS WE CONCLUDE IN THE REPORT WE THINK NOW THE OPPORTUNE TIME. TO BE ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH THAT SO WITH THAT MEMBERS I'M GONNA TURN IT OVER TO MISTER RIGHT AND HERE HE WILL STEP YOU THROUGH THE HAND OUT WHICH WILL BASICALLY. EL HELP LAPERRIERE'S SOME OF THE THESE THREE KEY ISSUES THAT I DE IDENTIFIED. PLEASE MR IT GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS MY NAME IS JORDAN RIGHT I'M A SENIOR AUDITOR WITH THE STATE AUDITOR'S OFFICE AND I WAS THE TEAM LEAD FOR THIS AUDIT OF. THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA. I WOULD LIKE TO BEGIN JUST BY SHARING SOME BRIEF BACKGROUND INFORMATION SOME OF IT'S BEEN TOUCHED UPON ALREADY AND THEN. HAS THE STATE AUDITOR SETTLE TALK THROUGH THOSE THREE FINDING AREAS. SO TO BEGIN WITH IN FISCAL YEAR TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN FOURTEEN THE STATE SHIFTED FROM THE CATEGORICAL APPROACH IT PREVIOUSLY USED TO THE TO THE- LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA. AGAIN THE INTENT BEING TO PROVIDE THAT LOCAL CONTROL DISTRICTS BUT ALSO TO REDUCE ACHIEVEMENT GAPS THAT EXIST. NOW WITH THOSE- INTENDED STUDENT GROUPS. ON PAGE ONE OF THE HANDOUT WE SHOW THE ELEMENTS OF THE- HEALTHY FF. BASED FUNDS WHICH AGAIN FOR ANY EDUCATIONAL PURPOSE AND THEN THE SUPPLEMENTAL IN CONCENTRATION FUNDS. THAT ARE. TO BE USED TO INCREASE OUR IMPROVE SERVICES. FOR THOSE INTENDED STUDENT GROUPS WE ALSO PROVIDE THERE AT THE BOTTOM A HYPOTHETICAL EXAMPLE OF HOW THAT CALCULATION ACTUALLY WORKS- WHAT I WOULD NOTE IS THAT. DURING THE PERIOD OF OUR AUDIT AND REALLY UP UNTIL THIS CURRENT FISCAL YEAR. THE CALCULATION HAS ACTUALLY BEEN PROVIDING A TARGET AMOUNT IT'S NOT BEEN THE ACTUAL FUNDING THAT DISTRICTS RECEIVE AN- THERE'S BEEN A PHASE IN PERIOD WHILE THE LCF WAS NOT FULLY FUNDED. AT THE BEGINNING AS IT'S GROWN ON THE STATE IS ADDED ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO FULLY FUND IT. THE STATE WAS USING A OF IN A- IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THAT PHASE IN APPROACH IDENTIFIED A TOTAL AMOUNT OF LC FF. THE DISTRICT WOULD RECEIVE IT DID NOT IDENTIFY HOW MUCH OF THAT WOULD BE SUPPLEMENTAL IN CONCENTRATION. SO AS A RESULT THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION HAD TO ADOPT SOME REGULATIONS THAT WOULD INSTRUCT DISTRICTS. IN HOW TO IDENTIFY AND DETERMINE HOW MUCH WAS- SUPPLEMENT ONE CONCENTRATION FUNDING. ON PAGE TWO WHAT WE SHOW. IS SOME OF THE IMPACT IN THE IMPLICATIONS OF THE APPROACH THAT THE STATE BOARD TOOK. AND ULTIMATELY WE FOUND THAT THOSE REGULATIONS THEY TOOK AN APPROACH OF BASING SUPPLEMENTAL IN CONCENTRATION FUNDING ON PRIOR YOU'RE SPENDING. RATHER THAN ON THE POPULATION OF INTENDED STUDENT GROUPS AND THAT RESULTED IN DISTRICTS IDENTIFYING LESS OF THEIR HEALTHY F. F. AS SUPPLEMENT ONE CONCENTRATION. THAN THEY WOULD HAVE IF THEY HAD FOLLOWED MORE CLOSELY THOSE PROPORTIONS THAT EXIST. IN THE FORMULA ITSELF SO THE HYPOTHETICAL EXAMPLE SHOWS YOU. THE TARGET AMOUNT- FOR A HYPOTHETICAL TWO HUNDRED MILLION IN THAT FIRST BY THE SECOND BAR IS SHOWING WHAT WOULD HAVE RESULTED IF THE STATE BAR THERE THE STATE BOARD HAD TAKEN AN APPROACH THAT MORE CLOSELY ALIGNED WITH THOSE PROPORTIONS YOU CAN SEE THE TWENTY. PERCENT IN SUPPLEMENTAL CONCENTRATION AND 80% AND THEN THE LAST BARS SHOWING WHAT THE STATE BOARD ACTUALLY IMPLEMENTED- AND YOU CAN SEE THE DIFFERENCE THERE IN THE AMOUNTS OF SUPPLEMENT ONE CONCENTRATION. AT THE BOTTOM OF THAT FIGURE WHAT YOU CAN SEE IS. AGAIN THE LIGHT YELLOW ON THE BOTTOM BUT DISTRICT ACTUALLY IDENTIFIED USING THOSE REGULATIONS SO THEY FOLLOW THE REGULATIONS. AND THE IDENTIFIED A MOUNTAIN FUNDING AS- WOMEN CONCENTRATION THE- HOWEVER. IS GOING AGAIN FOR OUR THREE. THE M. THAT. WOULD HAVE BEEN I. IF THEY HAD IF THE STATE HAD USE REGULATIONS THAT MORE CLOSELY ALIGNED WITH THOSE. PROPORTIONS THAT EXIST IN STATE LAW. JENNIFER A THREE HUNDRED AND TWENTY DOLLARS OVER THAT FIVE YEAR PERIOD. AND THAT IS BECAUSE I DE OR IT SHOWS THAT BY DEFERRING THAT IMPLEMENTATION OF SUPPLEMENTAL IN CONCENTRATION AND ALLOWING DISTRICTS TO BASE IT ON PRIOR YOU'RE SPENDING. THERE'S BEEN A-DELAY ULTIMATELY IN THE FUNDING THAT WAS SPENT FOR THOSE INTENDED STUDENTS AND LIKELY THE IMPROVEMENTS IN THEIR EDUCATIONAL OUTCOMES SO WE PROVIDE THIS REALLY AS- AN EXPECTATIONS SETTING THAT THAT PERHAPS NOT AS MUCH PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE AS MIGHT BE EXPECTED. I WILL KNOW THAT NOW THE HEALTHY FF IS FULLY FUNDED THE FORMULA IS NOW IDENTIFYING ACTUAL FUNDING AND SO THE REGULATIONS THAT THE STATE BOARD HAD ADOPTED ARE NO LONGER IN PLAY SO THIS IS A HISTORICAL PROBLEM THAT NO LONGER. NO LONGER EXISTS. MOVING TO PAGE THREE- AT THE STATE AUDITOR SAID- THE FIRST FINDING WAS REALLY THAT THE DISTRICTS HAVE AN INSURED IN THE STATES APPROACH HAS AN INSURER. THE DISTRICTS SPEND ABOUT FUNDING- ON SERVICES FOR THE INTENDED STUDENT GROUPS. AND THEY'RE REALLY THREE POINTS THAT I WANT TO MENTION AS HAS BEEN MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY THE STATE LAW DOESN'T EXPRESSLY REQUIRE THOSE FUNDS TO BE SPENT AND AS A RESULT ANY UNSPENT FUNDS CAN BE USED FOR ANY PURPOSE IN THE FOLLOWING YEAR. THE NEXT POINT STATE LAW DOESN'T REQUIRE THAT DISTRICTS TRACK THIS FUNDING. IN THEIR ACCOUNTING SYSTEMS THAT MAKES IT VERY DIFFICULT TO IDENTIFY WHETHER OR NOT ANY UNDER SPENDING OCCURRED. IN FACT THE EL CAP AND AS THE STATE AUDITOR MENTION THESE NUMEROUS. VOLUMINOUS DOCUMENTS IT'S THE ONLY PLACE THAT YOU CAN FIND THAT INFORMATION. AND SO WHAT WE DID IS WE REVIEWED FOR ON THE THREE SELECTED DISTRICTS AND THEIR BUDGETED AND ACTUAL EXPENDITURES IN THOSE DOCUMENTS. WE FOUND THAT. THE TWO OF THE DISTRICTS ACTUALLY UNDER SPENT. THERE SUPPLEMENT ON CONCENTRATION BY MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. ULTIMATELY WE MADE THE RECOMMENDATION THAT THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD AMEND STATE LAW AND REQUIRED DISTRICTS TO ANNUALLY RECONCILE THESE AMOUNTS HOW MUCH DID YOU RECEIVE HOW MUCH DID YOU BUDGET. AND HOW MUCH DID YOU ACTUALLY SPEND TO IDENTIFY THAT ON SPENT FUNDING. AND ANY OF THE UNSPENT FUNDING WE WOULD EXPECT THAT IT BE CARRIED OVER INTO FUTURE YEARS AND TO BE USED FOR THE PURPOSE THAT IT WAS INTENDED TO BE USED FOR. I WILL NOTE THAT THE STATE. THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION HAS MADE SOME CHANGES TO ITS- TEMPLATE IT'S ALSO IMPLEMENTED. A BUDGET OVERVIEW FOR PARENTS AS PART OF THE EL CAP DOCUMENT. AND TO THOSE CHANGES THAT THEY'VE IMPLEMENTED HAVE INTRODUCED SOME ADDITIONAL INFORMATION BUT IT DOES NOT. RESOLVE OUR CONCERN ABOUT RECONCILING IN CARRYING THOSE FUNDS OVER. ON THE NEXT PAGE GETS INTO OUR SECOND FINDING WHICH IS RELATED TO THE TO THE L. CAPS. WE FOUND THEY DON'T CONSISTENTLY PROVIDE THE TRANSPARENCY THAT WE WOULD EXPECT. DISTRICTS HAVE THE ABILITY TO SPEND SUPPLEMENTAL IN CONCENTRATION FUNDS FOR DISTRICT WIDE PURPOSES ESSENTIALLY THINGS THAT WOULD BENEFIT ADDITIONAL STUDENTS BEYOND JUST THE INTENDED STUDENT GROUPS BUT WHEN THEY DO THAT THE REQUIRED TO DEMONSTRATE IN THE EL CAP THAT THOSE FUNDS ARE PRINCIPALLY DIRECTED TOWARD THE INTENDED STUDENT GROUPS. WE FOUND THAT THEY DON'T ALWAYS CLEARLY DESCRIBE THAT IN THE EL CAP. ACT THIRTY SEVEN OF THE FIFTY THREE EXPENDITURES THAT WE LOOKED AT WERE UNCLEAR TO US WE COULDN'T DETERMINE WHETHER THOSE ARE PRINCIPALLY DIRECTED. ADDITIONALLY WE FOUND THAT SOME STAKEHOLDERS HAD SUBMITTED CLICK COMPLAINTS TO DISTRICTS ABOUT THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE AND CD E. HAD HAD RULED ON THOSE COMPLAINTS AND ACTUALLY FOUND SEVERAL THINGS- BULL FROM PITFALLS AND SOME BEST PRACTICES. CONSISTENT AMONG THOSE AMONG THOSE- RESPONSES THAT THEY PROVIDED. ULTIMATELY WE MADE THE RECOMMENDATION TO THE STATE BOARD THAT THEY SHOULD INCLUDE THAT INFORMATION INFORMATION ABOUT THE PITFALLS IN ABOUT THE BEST PRACTICES. IN THE EL CAP TEMPLATE SO THAT DISTRICTS KNOW IT AND CAN EITHER AVOID IT OR MAKE SURE THAT THEY DO IT AND ALSO ALLOWS THE COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION TO HOLD DISTRICTS FEET TO THE FIRE- TO NOT FALL INTO THOSE THE SAME PITFALLS. THE SECOND POINT THAT I WANT TO MENTION THERE IS REALLY THAT THEY THE INFORMATION RE REVIEWED IN EL CAPS DIDN'T REALLY COME CLEARLY COMMUNICATE. HOW THEY WERE EFFECTIVELY MEETING STUDENTS NEEDS- AS THE STATE AUDITOR MENTION THE GOALS ARE VERY BROAD THERE ARE NUMEROUS SERVICES. AND THE ANALYSIS THAT DISTRICTS ARE PROVIDING OUR AN OVERALL ANALYSIS THEY'RE NOT LOOKING AT SOME OF THESE INDIVIDUAL SERVICES. ADDITIONALLY 60% OF THE OUTCOME DATA THAT'S INCLUDED IN THE THREE DISTRICTS ALL CAPS THAT WE REVIEWED WAS EITHER PENDING OR IT WAS LAST YEAR'S DATA SO AGAIN IT'S NOT IT'S NOT HELPING YOU TO KNOW IF WHAT WHAT THEY'RE DOING THIS YEAR. IS RESULTING IN IN PROGRESS. AND THEN LASTLY THE LENGTH IN THE COMPLEXITY OF THE L. CAPS- HUNDREDS OF PAGES LONG AND COMPLEX DOCUMENTS. WE MADE RECOMMENDATIONS AGAIN TO THE STATE BOARD THAT THEY ADOPT A TEMPLATE THAT HELPS TO REDUCE SOME OF THE- DUPLICATION THAT OCCURS IN THE DOCUMENT BECAUSE OF. REPETITION WHEN THEY'RE PROVIDING ANNUAL UPDATES- WE RECEIVED THEIR RESPONSE AND REVIEWING IT HELLO GONNA HAVE SOME IT IN A FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS FOR THE STATE BOARD ON THAT. ON THAT SCORE. ON THE LAST FIND THAT I WANTED TO ABOUT THEM IS AGAIN RELATED TO THE OUTCOME. AS WE LOOKED AT THE DASHBOARD DATA FOR THE THREE DISTRICTS. WE DID SEE MONSTER PRUDENCE AT THE TIME WE ONLY HAD TWO DATA POINTS REALLY TWO YEARS OF DATA. AND THAT WE ALSO NOTED THAT. OVER TIME. CHANGES HAVE BEEN MADE TO THE TESTS THAT ARE BEING USED IN THERE'S BEEN CHANGES TO THE DASHBOARD INDICATORS ALTERNATELY FOUND THAT THEY CHEAPENED GAPS PERSIST- AND- WE FOUND. POLICYMAKERS REALLY LACK ADEQUATE INFORMATION TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE FUNDING THAT'S BEING USED IS HELPING TO INCREASE INTENDED STUDENT GROUPS HI PERFORMANCE. AND TO REDUCE THOSE ACHIEVEMENT GAPS. AS WE POINT OUT IN IN THE FIGURE ON PAGE FIVE. THERE'S NO CONNECTION BETWEEN EL CAPS AND THEIR ACCOUNTING SYSTEMS. AND THEY DON'T TRACK INFORMATION IN A WAY THAT ALIGNS WITH THE DASHBOARD SO YOU CAN NEVER SEE PROGRESS IN THE DASHBOARD AND BACK AND BACK TO WORK WITH. ON TO HELP TO ACHIEVE THAT PROGRESS IF YOUR SEEN. WHAT'S BEING DONE THAT SEEMS IN FACT BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT SEEN PROGRESS. ULTIMATELY WITH TO ADDRESS THE GAP BETWEEN FUNDING AND OUT COMES THE STATE COULD AND SHOULD COLLECTED DIGITAL INFORMATION. AND WE PROVIDE AN EXAMPLE SIMILAR TO WHAT THE STATE AUDITOR MENTIONED IF YOU'RE IF YOU'RE- PAYING FOR ENGLISH. TUTOR YOU SHOULD BE CAP A AND- IN ACCOUNTING SYSTEM SO YOU CAN TRACK THOSE EXPENDITURES. AND THEN THE STATE OTHER POLICY MAKERS. CAN COMPARE YOUR SPENDING WITH WHAT'S HAPPENING ON THE DASHBOARD. SO WE MADE THE RECOMMENDATION WE BELIEVE THAT'S AN IMPORTANT STEP TO UNDERSTANDING HOW BILLIONS OF DOLLARS ARE ARE IMPACTING STUDENTS LIVES. AND SO WE MADE THE RECOMMENDATION THAT THE STATE DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT A TRACKING MECHANISM TO ACHIEVE THIS. WE DO NOTE THAT IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET HE HAS INCLUDED SOME FUNDING TO IMPLEMENT WHAT HE TERMS AND EL CAP PORTAL- IT SEEMS TO BE DIRECTED AT THIS IDEA OF BEING ABLE TO LINK OUT WHAT YOU'RE SPENDING WITH WITH- WHAT'S HAPPENING ON THE DASHBOARD. IT DOESN'T ACHIEVE AS FAR AS WE CAN SEE RIGHT NOW THE CONCERN THAT WE HAVE ABOUT CONNECTING THE EL CAP WITH THE ACCOUNTING SYSTEM SO THAT YOU HAVE LINKAGE THERE. WE IN THE REPORT PUT FORTH THE A POSSIBILITY OF ADJUSTING THE STATE ACCOUNTING CODE STRUCTURE THAT EXISTS TO ACHIEVE THIS PURPOSE. SOME ULTIMATELY AN- CITY AND THE STATE BOARD- EXPRESSED SOME CONCERNS ABOUT. PERHAPS RETURNING TO A CATEGORICAL APPROACH- WE DISAGREE WITH THAT PERSPECTIVE WHAT WE'RE RECOMMENDING IS. IMPLEMENTING AN APPROACH TO IDENTIFY WHAT DISTRICTS SPENT THEIR FUNDING ON AFTER THEY'VE MADE THE DECISION IT WOULDN'T IMPINGE ON THE DISTRICT'S ABILITY. TO EXERCISE ITS LOCAL CONTROL TO CHOOSE OUT WANTS TO SPEND ITS MONEY IT JUST INFORM STAKEHOLDERS ABOUT WHAT CHOICE WAS. AND ALLOWS THEM TO THEN COMPARE WITH OUTCOMES THAT THEY'RE SEEING IN THE DASHBOARD ON THE LAST PAGE WE IN SOME OF THE- WEALTH ISSUES AND THE RECOMMENDATIONS IN THE INTENDED RESULTS ULTIMATELY. WE BELIEVE THAT BY IMPLEMENTING THESE LEGEND LEGISLATIVE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT THE STATE BETTER INSURERS THAT SUPPLEMENTAL IN CONCENTRATION FUNDS ARE ACTUALLY BENEFITING THOSE INTENDED STUDENT GROUPS. OUT WITH THAT IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS I'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER. RIGHT THANK YOU THANKS FOR THE PRESENTATION AND- WHICH ONE OF CLARIFY SOMETHING BECAUSE I'M PRETTY SURE I HEARD IT CORRECTLY. BUT UNLIKE CATEGORICAL FUNDS THE L. SAD LC FF FUNDING IS UNRESTRICTED MEANING DISTRICTS I CAN USE IT FOR ANY LOCAL EDUCATIONAL PURPOSE PROHIBITED BY LAW SO. IS THERE ANYTHING IN STATE LAW THAT REQUIRES DISTRICTS TO SPEND ALL OF THEIR SUPPLEMENTAL CONSTRUCTION PLANS. ON THESE THREE INTENDED STUDENT GROUPS. SO YOU'RE RIGHT THAT THEY ARE UNRESTRICTED FUNDS MEANING THAT THEY COULD THEY COULD DECIDE TO SPEND THE MON BOUNCING BASKETBALLS ARE PLANTING SEEDS AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER QUIRK SILVA HAD PUT FORTH. THE TYPE OF SERVICE OR THE THING THAT THE DISTRICT IS PURCHASING IS NOT. IS NOT GOVERNED BY STATE LAW. HOWEVER REGULATIONS REQUIRE THAT WHATEVER IT IS THAT YOU'RE BUYING IT NEEDS TO IMPROVE OUR INCREASE SERVICES FOR THOSE INTENDED STUDENT GROUPS. GOT IT. THE YEAH DID SLOT OF QUESTIONS HERE REG ONE MAKE SURE I GET THIS FOR THE REC TO SO IF THEY SPEND THE MONEY ON INTENT STUDENT GROUPS AND ONE YEAR THE FOLLOW YEAR. THERE'S NO ACCOUNTABILITY TO MAKE SURE THAT THE MONEY IS STILL SPENT FOR THOSE INTENDED STUDENT CORRECT PRECISELY THERE'S NO CONTROL THERE THAT'S GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT THE FUNDING IS ACTUALLY USED IN SUBSEQUENT YEARS FOR THOSE GROUPS GOT IT. MESSAGE HAVE YOU HAD A CHANCE TO REVIEW THE EL CAP TEMPLATE I KNOW WE KEEP TALKING ABOUT THE L. CAP THE STATE BOARD AND CD EASE- ROLE IN THAT AS WELL BUT- YOU TOUCHED UPON A YOU SAID HAVE YOU REVIEWED A LITTLE BIT OF IT BUT DON'T SEE THAT QUITE. CLEAR CONNECTIONS WITH HOW THE MONEY IS BEING ALLOCATED WHAT IT'S BEING SPENT ON BUT I KNOW THAT- THE ADMINISTRATION GOVERNOR'S OFFICE. DEPARTMENT ARE WORKING ON THE AL CAPP BEGAN. TO READ. LEAVE IT. UP PRIVY TO ANY OF THOSE JUST. I YOU DID AUDIT. SEE WHETHER NOT THIS GOING TO BE ADDRESS. YES MISTER CHAIR WE WERE IN CALL. WITH BOTH THE- AND THE STATE BOARD AS THEY- FOR WE DID GET TO LOOK AT THEY HAD. I THINK THREE DRAFTS AND THAT WERE KIND OF UP FOR CONTENTION AND THEY WERE DISCUSSING. WE EXPRESSED OUR- RECOMMENDATIONS TO THEM AT THE TIME. AND WHAT WE'VE SEEN COME OUT FROM THE STATE BOARD- THEY PROVIDED US THEIR THEIR SIXTY DAY RESPONSE. JUST AFTER THEY HAD THEIR MEETING TO APPROVE THE REVISED TEMPLATE. WHAT WE SEE IN THAT REVISED TEMPLATE IS THAT THEY HAVE. NOW INCLUDED SOME ADDITIONAL EXPENDITURE TABLES SO IT KIND OF PULL THAT INFORMATION OUT OF THAT THE EL CAP IT SELF AND PUTS IT IN A TABLE. THE CONCERN THAT WE HAVE WITH THEIR APPROACH IS THAT RATHER THAN. USING THE SUPPLEMENTAL IN CONCENTRATION FUNDING AS A DISTINCT ITEM THEY'RE TAKING APPROACH THAT. REALLY ROLLS UP ANY FUNDING THAT THEY USE WHETHER IT'S L. CFF GENERICALLY. ANY OTHER STATE FUNDING LOCAL FUNDING OR FEDERAL FUNDING AND THEY ROLL ALL OF THAT UP AS BEING- AND IDENTIFY IT AS USED TO ADDRESS HIGH NEEDS. FOR HIGH STUDENTS AGAIN OUR CONCERN IS THAT. IT IT MUDDIES THE WATER REALLY ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH SUPPLEMENTAL IN CONCENTRATION FUNDING IS FEDERAL FUNDING- LOCAL FUNDING BEING USED TO SUPPLANT THAT SUPPLEMENTAL IN CONCENTRATION FUNDING IT'S JUST NOT CLEAR CURRENTLY. GOT IT THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THAT AND PROPS LAS THE STATE BOARD AND- SIR THAT DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION WHEN THEY COME UP- HOW THIS HELPS IMPROVE TRANSPARENCY LIVING THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO FIND. THE CAL GOLDEN THE TRANSPARENCY ALRIGHT AB I HAVE ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS BUT I KNOW CENTER MORLOCK HAS QUESTIONS WELL. THANK YOU MAKE SURE I. FOR THE TIME COULD SHE- THAT I'M UNDER BUT THAT. OF MS HOWARD THREE SCHOOL DISTRICTS SELECT. FOR MISTER DIRECTOR YEAH. AS AS MEN IN THE WE WERE ASKED LOOK AT THREE LARGE SCHOOL THIS WE WERE ASKED TO LOOK AT ALSO GEOGRAPHICALLY DISPERSED SO WE SELECTED A SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. A DISTRICT FROM CENTRAL CALIFORNIA AND THEN A NORTHERN CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ALL OF WHICH WERE LARGE AND YOU'RE YOU'RE REPORTER PERSON REFERS TO FIND CENTER UNSPENT. I'M JUST WONDERING SINCE. THERE ISN'T A MISS OPPORTUNITY HERE BASED ON WHAT YOU'RE FINDING- THESE DISTRICTS AT LEAST THE CLOVIS IS HAVING SOME SERIOUS FISCAL DISTRESS. COULD THOSE FUNDS BE. TRANSFERRED TO MAKE A CAL STIRS PAYMENT OR A PAYMENT. OUR CONCERN IS THAT IF THEY'RE NOT SPENT IN THAT FIRST YEAR THERE REALLY ARE NO CONSTRAINTS TO THAT FUNDING SO IT COULD BE USED FOR ANYTHING OR GIVING THEM A TEMPTATION TO HELP THEM WITH THEIR DISTRESS AND- YES POTENTIAL YEAH. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISS RIGHT THANK YOU MISSILE THANK YOU MISTER. YEAH GO BACK TO THE UNDER. FUNDS AFTER THE FIRST YEAR OF THIS WORKS PLEASE. I AM MENTION IN THE C. D. R. THAT THERE HAD BEEN SOME. THAT HAD GONE TO THE C. D. E. N. THERE WERE SOME PITFALLS AND ALSO I GUESS BEST PRACTICES CAN YOU JUST GIVE US A FEW EXAMPLES OF WHAT THAT MIGHT LOOK LIKE ONLY. ONE THAT I KNOW JUST OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD IS- IN THAT WE SAW A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF WAS USING CONCLUSORY TYPE STATEMENTS SO THE DISTRICTS SAYING THIS WILL BE. PRINCIPALLY DIRECTED- WITHOUT EVER DESCRIBING HOW IT'S PRINCIPALLY DIRECTED THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT. CD E. HAD UPON THAT. THAT'S JUST NOT ENOUGH IT'S INSUFFICIENT- SOME OF THE OTHER- ITEMS THAT CD IDENTIFIED WAS SAYING BASICALLY THAT A DISTRICT SHOULD EXPLAIN HOW IT CONSIDERED FACTORS SUCH AS THE NEEDS CONDITIONS OR CIRCUMSTANCES OF ITS INTENDED STUDENT GROUPS AGAIN EXPLAINING THAT THIS IS THE NEED THAT THE STUDENTS HAVE AND THEREFORE WE'RE PROVIDING IT TO ADDRESS THAT PARTICULAR NEED- IN THE REPORT WE LIST OUT ALL OF THE- ALL OF THOSE ITEMS THAT WE FOUND. AGAIN ANOTHER ONE SIMPLY STATING THAT THE DISTRICT HAS HIGH ENROLLMENT PERCENTAGE OF INTENDED STUDENT GROUPS ISN'T ENOUGH- BECAUSE SERVING STUDENTS AS NOT THE SAME AS IN ROLLING STUDENTS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU DISTRICT WESTERNS I WOKE AT CAN I JUST ASK BECAUSE NOT COMPLETELY FAMILIAR WITH THIS WORLD BUT WHO'S IN CHARGE OF THE DASHBOARD. THE DEPARTMENT EDUCATION DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION I'M JUST AS THE L. CAPS ARE UNDER THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION YEAH UNDER THE ADMINISTRATION. ALL RIGHT AND SO FOR US TO GET ALL OF THIS ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY I'M JUST. TRYING TO LAY THE FOUNDATION FIGURE OUT HOW WE CONNECT. THE DEPARTMENT WITH THE ADMINISTRATION ED. AND THE CALIBER OF THE OF TRANSPARENCY THAT WE EXPECT FROM LEGISLATURE. AND SOME OF THE DISCUSSIONS AND SOME OF THE OVERTURES ABOUT THAT ACCOUNTABILITY TRANSPARENCY WILL BE VOTED ON. THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA IN THE FIRST PLACE SO APPRECIATE THE OVERVIEW- LET'S GO TO JUST MOVE ON TO THE NEXT PANEL US YOU HAVE ANY CONCLUDING REMARKS. NOT AT THIS TIME THANK ALL RIGHT THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK. THIS TIME WE'LL GO AHEAD AND CALL UP THE NEXT PANEL COMMENTS AND RESPONSES TO THE AUDIT WE HAVE ELIZABETH ASK AVAIL SENIOR DIRECTOR. OF POLICY GOVERNANCE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF SCHOOL BUSINESS OFFICIALS WE HAVE MISTER BRIAN RIVAS. AS SENIOR DIRECTOR OF POLICY AND GOVERNMENTAL. GOVERNMENT RELATIONS EDUCATION TRUST WEST. I MISS DEBORAH BROWN SENIOR MANAGING DIRECTOR OF EDUCATION AD GOVERNMENT RELATIONS FOR CHILDREN NOW. FEEL LIKE TO BEGIN PLACE THANK YOU THANK YOU MORNING COMMITTEE CHAIR MEMBERS LIVES BUT AVAILABLE CALIFORNIA. OF SCHOOL BUSINESS OFFICIALS REPRESENTING TWENTY THREE SCHOOL BUSINESS LEADER STATEWIDE. WE ARE NONPROFIT ASSOCIATION THAT PROVIDES PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES AND THIRTEEN DISCIPLINARY AREAS INCLUDING ACCOUNTING FINANCE AND OPERATIONS. SINCE THE BEGINNING OF LC FF WE HAVE SEEN A SHIFT IN HOW THE STATE'S. THE STATE AIMS TO ALIGN RESOURCES TO STUDENT SERVICES BASED ON TWO PRINCIPLES. FIRST TO PROVIDE RESOURCES TO MORE EQUITABLY TO STUDENTS. WITH LEARNING AND SOCIOECONOMIC BARRIERS AND TO PROVIDE GREATER OPPORTUNITIES FOR EDUCATORS TO SERVE AND RESPOND TO THEIR STUDENTS NEEDS. WHEN THE STATE ADOPTED THIS NEW FUNDING FORMULA IT TOOK TIME TO DEVELOP THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE KNOWN AS SYSTEM OF SUPPORT. WHICH IS INTENDED TO BE A CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT SYSTEM. THE STATE'S GUIDANCE WAS DEVELOPED US AT THE SAME TIME THAT THE FORMULA WAS BEING IMPLEMENTED. DURING THAT TIME CAVS WILL HAVE THE- TO PARTNER CHILDREN. AND EDUCATION PRESS LAST TO DEVELOP USER FRIENDLY TOOLS. TO HELP PARENTS AND STAKEHOLDERS ENGAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT. OF STUDENT CENTERED STUDENT FOCUSED SCHOOL BUDGETS. THE MATERIALS BEFORE YOU ARE EXAMPLES OF WHAT WE DEVELOPED. SO IF YOU HAVE THE MATERIALS ON THE LEFT SIDE YOU'LL SEE THESE. CAVS WILL HAVE AN ACTIVE STAKEHOLDER THROUGH THE NUMEROUS EL CAP TEMPLATE VERSIONS AND BELIEVE THAT THE LATEST REVISION OF THE L. CAMP TEMPLATE WHICH WAS ADOPTED BY THE STATE BOARD ON TWO JANUARY EIGHTH. ACCOMPLISHES THE GOALS OUTLINED BY THE LEGISLATURE AND AB EIGHTEEN FORTY AND ADDRESS MANY OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS MADE IN THE ART OF REPORT. SUCH AS STREAMLINED THE CONTENT AND FORMAT OF THE EL CAP TO MAKE THE INFORMATION MORE ACCESSIBLE FOR PARENTS AND STAKEHOLDERS. THE INFORMATION ABOUT ACTIONS IN A MANNER THAT ARE MORE. SHOWS WHETHER THE INCREASED OR IMPROVED SERVICES ARE BEING TARGETED. TO SPECIFIC SCHOOL SITES OR ON A DISTRICT WIDE BASIS. IT'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT THE EL CAP IS A THREE YEAR PLAN THAT DESCRIBES THE GOALS. ACTIONS SERVICES. AN EXPONENTIAL TO SUPPORT POSITIVE STUDENT OUTCOMES THAT ADDRESS STATE AND LOCAL PRIORITIES. THE OUTCOME PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY FOR LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES HOLDS KNOWN AS A LIAISON. TO SHARE THEIR STORIES OF HOW WHAT AND WHY PROGRAMS AND SERVICES ARE SELECTED TO MEET THEIR LOCAL NEEDS. WE HAVE ALSO PROVIDED YOU WITH A COPY OF THE UPDATED I'LL KEPT TEMPLATE. SHOWN AND IF YOU TO PAGE NINETEEN WHICH IS THE RED TAB YOU'LL FIND THEN. ON HOW. HOW TABLES WILL ALLOW AT LEAST TO DISPLAY EXPENDITURES AND SPEND FUNDS IN AND ACCESSIBLE MANNER WITHOUT THE NEED TO DISASSOCIATE ALL FUNDS. USED FOR EACH ACTION. HE JUST TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE AND TWENTY FOUR SHOW HOW THE DATA ENTRY TABLE TOTAL EXPENDITURE TABLE AND CONTRIBUTING EXPENDITURE TABLES ARE BROKEN DOWN. THE REVISED EL CAP TEMPLATE ALSO REQUIRES ELEAZAR TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN PLAN EXPENDITURES AN ESTIMATED ACTUAL EXPENDITURES WITH THE CONTINUED REQUIREMENT TO EXPLAIN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BUDGET EXPENDITURES AN ESTIMATED ACTUAL EXPENDITURES. IF YOU GOT YOUR FIRST BLUE TAB ON PAGE SIXTEEN YOU CAN SEE THE INSTRUCTIONS PROVIDED IN PAGES TWENTY FIVE AND TWENTY SIX. THE BLUE TAB. AND YOU CAN SEE HOW THE ACT AND UPDATES FOR. THE EACH YEAR IS ALSO BROKEN DOWN. ELLIE IS ALSO PROVIDED THE INFORMATION FOR EACH ACTION FOR THE RELEVANT EL CAP YEAR. THIS INCLUDES WHAT FUNDS ARE USED TO SUPPORT THAT ACTION. THESE ACTIONS CAN BE FUNDED FROM LCF FUNDS WHICH MAY INCLUDE ONE OR A COMBINATION OF BASE GRANT SUPPLEMENTAL AND OUR CONCENTRATION GRANT DOLLARS AND OR OTHER STATE. OR LOCAL OR FEDERAL DOLLARS SEEN ON PAGE TWENTY ONE WHICH IS NEAR GREEN TAB. CREATING A SET ASIDE MECHANISM TO RECORD THIS AND- FELL TO SHOW HOUSE DIST BREAK RESOURCES TO FUND PROGRAMS AND SUPPORT STAFF. WE ARE CONCERNED THAT REQUESTING ELEAZAR TO ONLY DISPLAY ONE SOURCE OF FUNDING FOR ONE SPECIFIC ACTION WILL CREATE FOR THE CONFUSION. SCHOOL DISTRICTS UTILIZE MULTIPLE FORCES TO ACCOMPLISH THE ACTIONS. THAT INCREASE AND IMPROVE SERVICES FOR STUDENTS LISTED UNDER EACH SPECIFIC GOAL BY STATE BY STATE WHY PRIORITY. FOR A- ASSEMBLY SCHOOL DISTRICT WITH 89% OF STUDENTS QUALIFYING AS ON DUPLICATED COUNT DECIDED TO PROVIDE HOME TO SCHOOL TRANSPORTATION SERVICE SERVICES DISTRICT WIDE. TO ADDRESS CHRONIC AND ACT ABSENTEEISM AND IMPROVE ACCESS TO BREAKFAST MEALS. WE ARE CONCERNED WITH FEATURE CHANGES THAT WOULD DISCONNECT THE REAL FUNDING ALLOCATION TO SUPPORT STRATEGIES AND ACTIONS DEVELOP AS A COMMUNITY WHICH IS REQUIRED AS PART OF THE L. CUT DEVELOPMENT. IT WOULD CREATE ADDITIONAL ADMINISTRATIVE WORK TO RECORD INFORMATION IN MULTIPLE PLACES AND EXPENSE THE EL CAP BY BREAKING UP REPORTING BY STAND ALONE FUNDING SOURCES FOR EACH SERVICE. SCHOOLS ARE UNDERFUNDED AND MUST USE MULTIPLE FORCES TO SUPPORT STAFF AND PROVIDE SERVICES. THE SUGGESTED METHOD MOVE AWAY FROM THE REVIEW AND ANALYSIS OF THE STUDENT ACADEMIC PROGRESS DURING I'LL CUT DEVELOPMENT AND INSTEAD FOCUSES ATTENTION ON INDIVIDUAL BUT LET BUDGET ALLOCATIONS. WITH THE ASSUMPTION THAT EACH INDIVIDUAL SERVICE CAN BE CORRELATED TO ONE STATE OR LOCAL INDICATOR FOR. CASUAL BELIEVES THAT STRENGTHENING THE STATE ACCOUNTABILITY SYSTEM AND INVESTING AN INTERACTIVE ONLINE ENVIRONMENT. DEVELOPING GUIDANCE AND BEST PRACTICES TO DELIVER SERVICES THAT ACHIEVE THE GOALS OF CLOSING THE ACADEMIC CAPS. IN IMPROVING THE MENTAL OVERALL WELL BEING OF OUR STUDENTS IS WHAT OUR EDUCATORS AND ADMINISTRATORS ARE SEEKING. CAVELL WILL CONTINUE TO DEL. TO FOCUS ON STUDENT OUTCOMES AND CLOSING THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP. THROUGH A STRONG SYSTEM OF SUPPORT BUT EMPOWER SCHOOLS AND EDUCATORS TO MEET THE UNIQUE NEEDS OF THEIRDIVERSE STUDENTS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU PLEASE DOES NOT ABOUT. MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS I BRIAN AND I'M SO OF THE EDUCATE TRUST WEST WERE RESEARCH POLICY ANALYSIS AND ADVOCACY ORGANIZATION FOCUSED ON CLOSING OPPORTUNITY AN ACHIEVEMENT GAPS UP HAVE A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT TAKE ON THE AUDIT WE WANT TO THANK THE STATE AUDITOR WE THANK HER ANALYSIS IS EXACTLY ON POINT IT IT ALIGNS WITH OUR OWN RESEARCH AND FEEDBACK FROM COMMUNITY GROUPS I ALSO WANT TO SAY AT THE OUTSET WE'RE STRONG SUPPORTER OF L. CFF. OUT WE SEE THIS AS AN EFFORT TO LIVE IT OR TO MAKE IT LIVE UP TO ITS PROMISE OF EQUITY AND ENSURING THAT THOSE WHO NEED MARQUETTE MORE WE'RE NOT TRYING TO CHANGE THE FUNDING FORMULA WE'RE ALSO NOT INTERESTED IN TYING THE HANDS OF DISTRICTS IN ALTERING THE RULES REGARDING HOW DECISIONS ARE MADE WE JUST WANT TO SEE THOSE DECISIONS. AND SURE QUICKLY. ADVOCATES IN OTHER STATES ARE LOOKING TO SEE WHETHER. ELSE HAS WORKED THERE THERE CONSIDER SIMILAR. THEIR FIRST IS IT WORK. SECOND QUESTION IS. DID THE STUDENT FOR THE ARGETS BENEFIT. SO WE THINK THOSE ARE THE RIGHT QUESTIONS- WITH REGARD TO DID IT WORK A DIP DEPENDS VERY MUCH ON WHO DO WHO YOU ASK WE HAVE A MIXED BAG WHEN IT COMES TO OUTCOMES WE HAVE SOME PERSISTENT GAPS IN OUR STANDARDIZED TEST SCORES BUT THERE IS SOME PROMISING NEWS ON THE A THROUGH G. COMPLETION AND GRADUATION FRONT. BUT WHEN IT COMES TO DO THE INTENDANT STUDENTS BENEFIT WE REALLY NEED TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION BECAUSE THEY'RE SHOCKED WHEN WE WHEN YOU TELL PEOPLE IN OTHER STATES WE DON'T KNOW. WE DIDN'T FIGURE THAT OUT WELL UP. SO THOSE ARE MY OVERVIEW COMMENTS THAT WE REALLY APPRECIATE THE ANALYSIS WE THINK IT'S RIGHT ON POINT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE PROBLEMS OF THE EL CAP. HAVE ANY OF YOU HAVE. SEEN IN ALL CAPS HAVEN'T. I'D SUGGEST TAKING A LOOK AT ONE. THEY ARE INCREDIBLY CUMBERSOME DIFFICULT DOCUMENTS TO WORK WITH THEIR RUNNING. TWO HUNDRED THREE HUNDRED SOMETIMES MORE PGES I AM GET TO MEET SOMEONE WHO. IS NOT PAID TO READ ALL CAPS PICK UP IN EL CAP AND UNDERSTAND. I RECOGNIZE THAT THERE'S BEEN MARGINAL IMPROVEMENTS AND WE'RE CONTINUING TO WORK ON IT THERE'S A LOT OF GOOD FAITH GOING INTO THOSE DISCUSSIONS. BUT AS IT STANDS OUT CAP IS OF AN OF I'M SORRY TO SAY APPLAUD DOCUMENT AND NOT MEDIAN THE MORE ARE NOT. SERVING ITS PURPOSE. UP MEANT I OFFER A FEW COMMON ABOUT WHY WE CHANCE. IS SOMEONE. AT A PRINCIPLED LEVEL JUST A REMINDER FEEL LIKE SOMETIMES WE FORGET IN THE POLICY SPACE THESE ARE PUBLIC DOLLARS FOR PUBLIC SCHOOL MONEY AND THAT A PRINCIPAL LEVEL WE THINK ANYONE IN THE PUBLIC SHOULD BE ABLE TO SEE ALL THOSE FUNDS ARE BEING YOU STE. ASIDE FROM THAT THOUGH THERE ARE SOME IMPORTANT FACTORS RELATED TO ENGAGEMENT WHEN LCF WAS BORN WE WERE TOLD THAT DECISION MAKING WHAT HAPPENED LOCALLY BUT THAT COMMUNITIES WOULD PLAY. AN ACTIVE ROLE IN THOSE DECISIONS AND IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO DO THAT AS A COMMUNITY MEMBER OR A PARENT. WHEN YOU LACK THE INFORMATION THERE'S AN IMBALANCE BETWEEN DISTRICTS AND COMMUNITIES. AND WE REALLY NEED TO RECTIFY THAT. SECONDLY IS COUNT. DID THE FUNDING. OR WAS THE FUNDING USED IN THE WAY THAT THE DISTRICT AGREED TO USE THEM AND THEY ALL CAP WE CAN'T. REALLY ANSWER THAT QUESTION IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO TELL. EQUITY DID THE FUNDING HELP THOSE WHO DESERVE MORE. IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO ANSWER THAT- RIGHT NOW. AND THEN LAST YOU'LL SAY VOTER CONFIDENCE UP MOST OF US WHO WORK IN THIS SPACE ARE IN AGREEMENT THAT OUR SCHOOLS ARE UNDERFUNDED AND WE WOULD LIKE TO TAKE STEPS TOWARDS ADEQUACY BUT IT'S DIFFICULT TO ASK THE VOTERS TO INVEST MORE WHEN THERE ARE SO MANY QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW THE CURRENT FUNDING IS YOU STE WE'RE GOING TO BE HAVING DISCUSSIONS FOR YEARS ABOUT ADEQUACY. AND ADDRESS WHETHER URGES THAT WE REALLY HOME ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS FIX THE TO FIX THE TRANSPARENCIES SO WE COULD WORK TOGETHER ON A PER AT A EDUCATION. AND THEN THE AUDITOR REMINDED US HOW IMPORTANT TRANSPARENCY IS TO PROGRAM EVALUATION IT IS RARE I I'M HARD PRESSED TO THINK OF A FIELD WHERE YOU SET A GOAL AND TAKES STEPS TOWARDS IT AND EVALUATE THE DECISIONS ON THE STEPS. TO TRY TO GET. WE THINK AND SEE IS INCREDIBLE HELP HEALTHY AND WILL MAKE ELSE. MORE OF A FOR EVERYONE. AND SO GLAD THAT IT WAS IN WE'RE HAPPY TO PAY A SPONSOR OF DOCTOR WEBBER'S BILLS IMPLEMENTING THE RECOMMENDATIONS THANK YOU. WITH THE CITY OF MORNING AT CHAIRMAN SALAS AND MEMBERS THAT I'M DEBORAH BROWN ON BEHALF OF A REPRESENTING CHILDREN NOW WHICH IS A NON. PARTISAN EQUITY FOCUSED RESEARCH ADVOCACY ORGANIZATION WORKING TO IMPROVE CHILDREN'S ADVOCACY AND ENSURE THAT ALL KIDS HAVE THE SUPPORTS THEY NEED TO REACH THEIR FULL POTENTIAL WE THANK YOU FOR INCLUDING US ON THIS PANEL WE APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO TALK ABOUT THE FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE STATE AUDITOR. AS SHE TEAM REVIEWED THE IMPLEMENTATION ABOUT A FAST AND WE THANK THEM FOR THEIR THANKS FOR THEIR THOUGHTFUL ANALYSIS. THE ODD IT HELPS ROUND OUT THE IMPORTANT MILESTONES IN THE LIFE OF L. CFS INCLUDING REACHING RECENTLY REACHING FULL IMPLEMENTATION AS WELL AS THE L. CAPRI DESIGN WHICH HAS BEEN DISCUSSED WITH. THEM WHICH SUPPORTS MAKING ELSE OF MY TRANCE X. TAKE. UNTIL NOW IT'S BEEN A STRONG OF LC SAID IT'S AND MORE THAT WE- CAN TO BE. TAKE THAT ONLY STRING. IT WE WILLING STRONGLY AND I'LL SEE IF. FOUNDATIONAL PER. OF A FUN FOR ALL DISTRICTS THE IMPERATIVE TO PROVIDE SUPPLEMENTAL FUNDING FOR STUDENTS WITH ADDITIONAL NEEDS THE FLEXIBILITY TO RESPOND TO THOSE NEEDS IN A WAY THAT UNDERSTANDS THE UNIQUE NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY. AND BE TO ENSURE ENGAGEMENT AND TRANSPARENCY THIS PART THOSE PRINCIPLES ARE WRITTEN INTO THE STATUTE. THROUGH THE FORMULA ITSELF WHICH IS STATUS IS THAT BASED FUNDING BY PROVIDING THE SUPPLEMENTAL A CONCENTRATION FUNDING. IT ALLOWS THE FLEXIBILITY FOR THE USE OF THOSE SUPPLEMENTAL CUT. DOLLARS AND IT ELEVATES PARENT ENGAGEMENT AND FAMILY INVOLVEMENT AS ONE OF THE EIGHT STATE PRIORITY. AS WELL AS ESTABLISHING THE EL CAP PROCESS THAT INCLUDES ENGAGEMENT AS WELLS ILLUSTRATES HOW RESOURCES WOULD BE SPENT TO IMPROVE OUTCOMES FOR OUR MOST VULNERABLE KIDS. WE ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT WE MUST NOT TURN AWAY FROM OPPORTUNITIES TO TAKE WHAT WE HAVE LEARNED FROM ELSE IF THAT ONE. IMPLEMENTATION ARE A- PROVE MEANT AND WE MUST. CHANGES AFTER THE NEED THE WHOLE EDUCATION COMMUNITY. THE STATE BOARD BY SYSTEM HAS MADE STATE IMPROVEMENT TO THE L. EMPLOYED OVER THE TO THE- AGENT OF IMPLEMENTATION. IT'S RECENT CHANGE THE LEGISLATURE WRECKED. THIS IS WELL IN. INTO THOUSAND EIGHT TASK IN STATE BOARD PROVIDE THE TEMP. INCLUDE CONSTABLE. FISCAL ACCOUNT A- AND TO DO SO IN A WAY THAT'S AND ACCESSIBLE TO PARENTS. THE GOVERNOR'S ALSO. BY AT IN A PER. AND RECENT BUDGET TO CREATE IN ALL CAPS. AND OPENING CONVERSE ON STRENGTH. ACCOUNT OF. WHAT IS KEY IN MAKING THESE A- AS THAT WE ARE IS THAT THEY ARE IN FOR BY WHAT IS OCCURRING AT THE LOCAL LEVEL FOR DISTRICTS. PARENTS AND COMMUNITIES AND THE MAINTAIN THE CORE PRINCIPLES OF ELSE FF WITHOUT OVER CORRECTING. SO WAS TO PUT BARRIERS THAT ARE INCONSISTENT WITH THE INTENT. OF THE TIME THE AUDIT ALLOWS HER FOR THE REFLECTIVE AND CRITICAL LANDS AND- LCF OPERATING WHAT'S WORKING AND WHAT CAN IMPROVED. THE FINDINGS RECOMMENDATIONS FOR. A ROAD MAP TO THE LEGISLATURE AND THE STATE BOARD AND HOW THEY CAN MAKE THOSE ADJUSTMENTS IN WAYS THAT SUPPORT LC FF. WITHOUT THAT IT A CORRECTION. WE VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE POSITIVE CHANGES CD EAST BOARD AND STAFF AND MEMBERS. FELT TEMPLATE INCLUDING CLEMENTE COME THE RECOMMEND. WE ALSO NICE THAT YOU'RE BETTER CLARIFY GOALS IN OUTCOMES. ON THE PLAN AT IN BY USING THE TIMELESS DATA. ALSO ADDING ACTION FOSTER IS IN THE HAPPEN. WITH THEIR VERY POSITIVE. HOWEVER MY NEEDS BE DONE TWENTY RENTS. WHICH IS COULD TO ENTER WHERE TO. VESTING IN OUR BONTA TO POP. AND THEIR WRIST THE OP IS THAT WILL. MOVE OUT. THAT IT WE'RE ALL PLEASE. SIR. THE CHANGES PROPOSED IN THE BILLS DON'T MAKE ANY CHANGES TO THAT BROADER FLEXIBILITY THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT. THE DISTRICTS HAVE IN SUPPLEMENTAL CONCENTRATION DOLLARS AND ENSURING THAT THEY ARE USED TO INCREASE AND IMPROVE SERVICES. AND THAT THEY DON'T CHANGE IN ANY WAY THE ABILITY OF DISTRICTS TO USE THOSE FUNDS FOR SCHOOL WIDER DISTRICT QUITE PURPOSES. IF THAT IS AN EFFECTIVE WAY TO ADDRESS THIS TARGETED POPULATIONS. THE STATE HAS INVESTED SEVEN POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IN SUPPLEMENTAL CONCENTRATION GRANTS AND STATE BEGAN LC FF. AND IT'S TIME TO HAVE A BETTER SENSE OF HOW THOSE RESOURCES ARE BEING USED WITHIN DISTRICTS AND ACROSS THE STATE. TO FOR THE EDUCATIONAL OUTCOMES. ENDING HOUSE SUPPLEMENTAL AND CONCENTRATION DOLLARS ARE YOU SHOULD NOT BE. IT SHOULD BE EASIER THAN IT IS NOW IT SHOULD NOT TAKE THE PUBLIC POLICY INSTITUTE OF CALIFORNIA COMBINING. NUMEROUS EIGHT OR NINE DATA SOURCE SETS TO ATTEMPT TO UNDERSTAND IF DISTRICTS ARE INDEED INCREASING AND IMPROVING SERVICES. FOR THE DARK TARGETED STUDENT POPULATION AND IT SHOULD NOT TAKE THE STATE AUDITOR MONTHS TO UNDERSTAND THIS. WE NEED WE NEED TO BE. WE NEED TO HAVE IT BE AN EASY PROCESS THAT PARENTS AND COMMUNITY GROUPS CAN ACTIVELY ENGAGE IN. IS ABOUT COURSE CRAP CORRECTION OR ADOPTION TO ENSURE FIDELITY TELL CFF AND TING THE NEEDS OF ALL OF OUR STUDENTS. AND THE AUDIT. AND RECOMMENDATIONS ARE CRITICAL INFORMING THE NEXT STEP IMPROVE LCF. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU THANK YOU GUYS FOR YOUR TESTIMONY- LET ME JUST ASK. A QUESTION AND THEN. OPENED UP TO MY COLLEAGUES TO. IT SOUNDS LIKE EVERYONE'S IN AGREEMENT WITH WHAT THE AUDITOR CAME OUT WITHIN THEIR- THEIR RECOMMENDATIONS BUT IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE THAT YOU GUYS WOULD. SEE OUR TO SEE DONE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE- AND TENDED. A RESOURCES ARE GOING TO THESE THESE THREE THESE THREE GROUPS. OF THE INTENSIVE IN GROUPS. I'M I GET INTO THE JUST AS THE I THINK PART OF IS ALSO ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT WERE NOT LIKE I WAS TALKING ABOUT YOU KNOW OVER CORRECTING SO I THINK WHAT WE'D LIKE TO SEE IS HAVE THE RECOMMENDATION ALL OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE AUDITOR IMPLEMENTED. LET THE EL CAP TEMPLATE PLAY OUT SO WE CAN SEE HOW THAT'S WORKING IN AND THEN MAKE ADJUSTMENTS OVERTIME SO I THINK IF WE MAINTAIN THE COURSE WERE ON NOW INCLUDING WHAT THE GOVERNOR HAS PROPOSED. THAT THAT WOULD LIKE TO SEE HOW THAT PLAYS OUT TO SEE IT IF WE NEED TO MAKE ADDITIONAL CHANGES. CHAIRMAN OF. WE DID DISCUSS THE AUDIT RECOMMENDATIONS- AS AN EQUITY COALITION. AND US SEVERAL PARTNERS WHO WORK IN THE SPACE OF. THE WE THINK THE RECOMMENDATIONS ARE. EXACTLY WHAT'S NEEDED. THE ONE THING THAT WAS MENTIONED WAS PERHAPS ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE. TO COUNTY. SUPERVISOR ARTS I'M SORRY COUNTY SUPERINTENDENTS. WHEN THEY REVIEW THE EL CAP. RIGHT NOW THAT'S- REVIEWED PRIMARILY. TO SEE WHETHER THAT DISTRICT FOLLOWED. THE EL CAP I THINK REQUIREMENTS INSTRUCTIONS. AND PERHAPS STRENGTHENING THAT REPEAT SOMETHING TO CONSIDER. OF IT. OUT PLEASE. WE APPRECIATE THE PROGRESS THAT HAS BEEN MADE ON THE AL CAPP IN THE STATE BOARD AND WE HAVE BEEN THERE PUBLICLY TO STATE THAT SUPPORT AND APPRECIATION I THINK OUR CONCERN. IS ON WHAT OF A TRACKING MECHANISM AND THE FUTURE WOULD LOOK LIKE- AND THAT IS JUST A QUESTION AND CONCERN. YEAH AND I KNOW WE'RE ALL ANTICIPATING HER EAGERLY A PROBABLY ANTICIPATING WHAT THE ALL CAPS CAN LOOK LIKE WITH THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION IS ACTUALLY DOING TO NOT ONLY REVIEW THE TEMPLATE. BUDGET INSURE THAT THE TRANSPARENCY IN THE CARRABELLE ANY IS THERE FOR THESE INTENDED PURPOSES- SO WE'RE WITH YOU ON THAT AS WELL. SO LET ME ASK YOU IS A DIFFERENT QUESTION- WE KEEP TALKING ABOUT THE INTENDED PURPOSES OF LCF FOR THESE STUDENT GROUPS. BUT IS THERE ANYTHING FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE THAT WE CAN DO MAYBE TWO. HOW DO WE ALLEVIATE THE PRESSURE FROM. THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO TRY TO GO AFTER THESE FUNDS. RIGHT I MEAN IS IT. INCREASING BASS FINDING IT I MEAN IS THAT WHY. LIKE WHERE THE GAPS AND WHY IT WHY ARE THERE PRESSURES. TO TWO AB USES RESOURCES FOR OTHER THINGS. I HEARD ON BEHALF OF MY ORGANIZATION. WE RECOGNIZE THAT OUR SCHOOLS ARE UNDERFUNDED-GETTING DOWN TO FAX TO I THINK ESTIMATED AN ADDITIONAL TWENTY BILLION DOLLARS ARE OVER TWENTY BILLION THAT'S REQUIRED TO PROVIDE OUR STUDENTS INADEQUATE EDUCATION SO I THINK WE RECOGNIZE THE PRESSURES DISTRICTS ARE UNDER- TO MAKE ENDS MEET AND WE NEED TO WORK TOGETHER THINK TO PUT MORE MONEY INTO THE SYSTEM. BUT AS AN ADVOCACY ORGANIZATION MORE MONEY ISN'T THE ANSWER ALONE IT DEPENDS ON HOW THE MONEY IS USED SO- BUT I THINK WE NEED TO WORK TOGETHER ON THE ADEQUACY. YOU AT. VERY MUCH AGREE THAT WE WERE SEE FUNDING FOR THE BASE GRANT ANY ADDITIONAL ONE TIME DISCRETIONARY DOLLARS I WILL ALLOW US TO CONTINUE USE OF FUNDING FOR THE FOR OTHER PURPOSES AS WELL AS- ANY GENERAL FUND DOLLARS TO HELP RELIEVE SOME PENSION COSTS. GOD OKAY I'M MAYBE I'LL JUST ASK SCHOOL GROUPS WHEN THEY COME UP NEXT. LIKE WHERE THE GAPS ARE WHERE THEY'RE TRYING TO FILL BUT- THERE'S NO QUESTIONS SOMEONE RECORDS OF A PLACE. SO WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE L. CANNOT IN THE SUPPLEMENT GROUPS AND- EVERYTHING RELATED TO THE DOCUMENT HAS BEEN HAS BEEN NOTED IT'S NOT REALLY- NECESSARILY FAMILY FRIENDLY AS FAR AS PARENTS KIND OF GETTING BUT IT'S NOT ALL EVEN TEACHER FRIENDLY. BECAUSE MANY MANY OF THE EDUCATORS DON'T EVER INTERACT WITH THIS DOCUMENT IS SOMETIMES DONE- AT THE SITE LEVEL BY A PRINCIPAL OR A LEADERSHIP TEAM SO EVEN HOW WE FUND OUR SCHOOLS PERIOD I WOULD TELL YOU PROBABLY 80% OF THE TEACHERS DON'T EVEN KNOW. IT'S THEY HAVE THEIR CLASSROOMS THEY HAVE THEIR CURRICULUM THEY HAVE TO IMPLEMENT AND THE DECISIONS EVEN HOW THE MONEY IS USED UP PROBABLY WOULDN'T EVEN NORMALLY COME UP AND REGULAR CONVERSATIONS FOR TEACHERS. BECAUSE AGAIN USUALLY DO AT A DISTRICT LEVEL. BUT IF YOU COULD SPEAK IN MIND OF PARENT LANGUAGE WHICH IS OF. EVEN THOUGH WE ARE TRYING TO IMPROVE THE DOCUMENT AND OUTCOMES FOR OUR SUPPLEMENT GROUPS THERE HAS TO BE SOME TYPE OF DATA ACROSS THE STATE THAT AFTER SIX YEARS OF VIEW OF. KIND OF GOING THROUGH THIS. NEW PROCESS OF THINGS THAT MIGHT HAVE WORKED BECAUSE I ALWAYS FEAR THAT EVEN THOUGH WE'RE DOING ALL THIS TRYING TO IMPROVE A DOCUMENT THE BOTTOM LINE IS WE WANT TO IMPROVE THE- THE EXPERIENCE FOR NOT ONLY THE KIDS IN THE CLASSROOM THAT ARE IN THAT. GROUPS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT BUT FOR ALL OF THE KIDS AND WE WANT TO KNOW THAT THERE'S SOME TYPE OF PROCESS THAT WE CAN GO THROUGH THAT SAYS YOU KNOW WE THINK THAT REALLY WORKS. BECAUSE WE COULD KEEP GOING THROUGH THIS AND STILL HAVE THE SAME OUTCOMES EVEN IF THEY'RE MORE TRANSPARENT SO LET ME JUST GIVE YOU ONE EXAMPLE. WITH THAT AT THE STATE. THAT WE KNOW. THERE IS A HUGE AMOUNT OF THIS IS IN THE CLASSROOMS TO FOCUS ON THAT TEST AND HAVE BETTER ACHIEVEMENT BECAUSE THAT'S IN ESSENCE WHAT WE'RE USING TO DETERMINE WHICH I DON'T BELIEVE BELIEVE IT OR NOT I DON'T THINK THAT'S WHAT WE SHOULD BE DOING BUT THAT IS WHAT WE ARE DOING SO THAT TEST IS NOW BEING. TAKEN ON IPAD. AND I KNOW THAT WE HAVE SPENT BILLIONS OF DOLLARS BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. ON TECHNOLOGY OVER THE LAST DECADE WHETHER IT'S IPADS OR COMPUTERS WHATEVER IT IS AND IT CHANGES EVERY TWO MINUTES. AND YET THE BASIC MATERIAL THAT STUDENTS NEED IS A KEYBOARD. AND I'VE SEEN OVER AND OVER SCHOOLS AREN'T BUYING KEYBOARDS OR THEY'RE HIDING THEM IN THE CLOSET BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO RUIN BECAUSE WHEN YOU TEST YOU NEED TO HAVE ALL YOUR KEYBOARDS WORKING IN THE MALL CHARGE THE SOUNDS REALLY KIND OF IN THE WEEDS. BUT THEN SCHOOLS STILL ARE TRYING TO GET MONEY FOR KEYBOARDS. AND THEY'RE NOT EVEN TEACHING KEYBOARDING SO WHO'S GOING TO HAVE THE ACCESS ISSUE WHEN YOU GO INTO THIRD GRADE AND YOU HAVE TO WRITE US THREE TO FOUR PARAGRAPH ESSAY AND THEY'VE NEVER HAD KEYBOARDING AND YEAH THAT'S ONE OF THE TESTING SO HOW DO WE DECIDE FOR ALL OF THIS. AND GET TO WILL ALREADY KNOW CREATE BARRIERS AND ACCESS SO WHO'S GOING TO TAPPED HIGHER OR LOWER WITH JUST THAT ONE EXAMPLE. KIDS WEB INTERNET INTERNET AND HAVE KEYBOARDS AND AT PRACTICE OR KIDS WHO HAVE NONE OF THAT. I'M SORRY MISS QUIRK SILVA I'M NOT HE SAID A LOT. I'M HAVING TROUBLE TRACKING THOSE IT WAS THE REQUESTED OKAY AS I GUESS IT WAS A COMMENT LIKE ALL OF THESE DISCUSSIONS WE CAN HAVE THE BOTTOM LINE WE CAN PUT MORE MONEY INTO SYSTEM WE CAN DO THIS BUT IF WE'RE NOT STILL RECOGNIZING THE BASIC THINGS THAT CREATE BARRIERS FOR OUR KIDS AND MOST OF THE TIME THEY'RE IN THE SUPPLEMENTAL GROUPS. THEY DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO THE SAME TYPE OF EXPERIENCES OTHER UP KIDS HAVE AND THEN WE DO SAY NOW WE HAVE THE MONEY. FOR IT WE STILL DON'T USE IT HOW CAN WE FIGURE OUT HOW WE'RE GOING TO CLOSE THIS OPPORTUNITY GAP. FOR THE WHAT THE ONE THING I WOULD ADD TO THAT I THINK THIS IS PART OF THE THAT THE PROMISE OF THE SYSTEM OF SUPPORT WHICH IS REALLY. AROUND TRYING TO PROVIDE THE SUPPORTS REDISTRICTING THAT DOESN'T DIRECTLY INTO YOUR QUESTION BUT I THINK. THAT'S WHERE WE'RE GETTING INTO WE YOU KNOW WE NEED DATA TO UNDERSTAND WHAT'S HAPPENING SO MORE AND BETTER DATA- YOU ACROSS SYSTEMS WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT SO WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND THE ROLE OF. EARLY LEARNING AND HOW THAT PLAYS INTO THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP RIGHT FROM FROM T. CARE KINDERGARTEN- BUT HOW DO WE- KNOW WHAT'S WORKING AND WHAT'S NOT APPLY BEST PRACTICES. AND AGAIN I THINK THAT'S PART OF THE PURPOSE OF THE SYSTEM OF SUPPORT IS THAT IT WILL- IT TAKE THOSE DISTRICTS THAT THAT ARE STRUGGLING IN IN VARIOUS WAYS AND BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THEM. I IDEALLY YOU UTILIZING BEST PRACTICES. I WOULD DISAGREE WHATEVER ON THAT AS WE ARE SEEING UPDATES TO THE DASHBOARD WILL START BEING ABLE TO IDENTIFY IT. HOW WE CAN. SERVICE FIRST. COME. I THINK YEAH. OKAY THAT'S SWEET. THE THAT'S THE IN. OF THE OF THE OKAY IN THE- LOW CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA AND ALL THOSE KINDS OF THINGS WE DON'T. WE SHOULD NEVER LOSE SIGHT THAT. THE OUTCOME THE IT THE PURPOSE OF ALL OF THIS IS SUPPOSED TO IMPROVE STUDENT PERFORMANCE. OF AN OUTCOME FOR KIDS IN IN IN THE STATE WHETHER THEY'RE THE- THE KIDS GETTING THE BASS GRANT WHETHER THAT KIDS WILL GETTING THE ADDITIONAL SUPPLEMENTAL. THAT WE'VE BEEN TOLD THAT LOCAL CONTROL THE ABILITY OF EDUCATORS TO SIT. AND TO DECIDE HOW TO USE DOLLARS. NOT JUST FOR THEIR CONVENIENCE BUT FOR THE PROGRESS OF THE STUDENTS. IS CRITICAL THAT ONE SIZE DOES NOT FIT ALL AND YET AT THE SAME TIME IF YOU DON'T HAVE GOOD DATA. AND MOST OF ADMINISTRATORS WILL IT NOT WAS THAT THAT THEY HAVE TO HAVE GOOD DATA AT THEIR SCHOOLS. THEY HAVE TO KNOW WHERE THE MONEY'S GOING AND THEY HAVE TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO ASSESS THAT DATA. IN THE PROMISED WELL AS AT THE END OF YOUR TO DETERMINE WHAT THE NOT. WHAT IS IT WORKING. AND THAT ONE OF THE REAL CHALLENGE IS THAT. YOU KNOW WHEN WE WERE GETTING READY TO DO. SO ADDITIONALLY THE L. FF AND- I WENT TO SEVERAL. OF MEETINGS IT AT SCHOOL. AND MANY MANY VERY. AND TOLD AND I WAS TELLING THEM WHAT THE INTO WAS. DIGITAL DOT. AND THEY SAID WELL GREAT THE MOVE TO GET BACK OUR LIVE. AND WE'RE TO GO IN THEY MEDIA HAD A LIVE OF THINGS THEY WANTED TO GO BACK AND GET. AND I SAID OKAY THAT SOUNDS GOOD WHEN YOU HAD A LIBRARIAN OR LIBRARY A NEW SCHOOL WELL AS THE PERFORMANCE OF THE STUDENTS AT THE TIME. ALL THE SAME AS IT IS THE DAY OKAY WHY WOULD YOU GO BACK INTO THEIR- WEDDING THOUGHT ABOUT A JUST FIGURE THIS IS WHAT WE DON'T DO THEM UP AND GET ALL PIC OF THESE THINGS I'M SAYING NO. YOU SHOULD BE ASSESSING IT BECAUSE I'M NOT SAYING DON'T GET A LIBRARIAN. WHAT I'M SAYING IF YOU GET ONE DON'T GET ONE LIKE YOU HAD BEFORE THEY HAVE NO CONNECTION WHATSOEVER. MAYBE TO THE LIMITS OF STUDENT. AND IF YOU GET KNOW SO. PEOPLE WERE GOING BACK AND GRABBING THINGS THAT WERE COMFORTABLE. UP AND I'M SAYING TO THEM THAT'S NOT WHAT LOCAL CONTROL IS ABOUT LOCAL CONTROL ABOUT. SAYING IF THAT'S A CASE AND CAN GIVE YOU GOTTA GO BECAUSE IT'S OKAY YOU MONEY TO LIVE. IS YOU MIGHT FOR THIS YOU'RE MY FOR THAT AND THEN YOU COMPLY. THAT YOU WE TALK YOU HOW TO USE ALL THE MONEY IN IT DOESN'T WORK. SO RATHER THESE GOING. UP FOR MIL YOU BASED. ON A WHAT YOU DO AT YOU DON'T HAVE A GOOD DAY. I DON'T KNOW WHO WHAT YOU'RE DOING AND HOW YOU. IT IN AT WHAT LEVELS EVEN IF YOU GET THE LIVE AND DO THIS. TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT IT'S WORKING IF NOT FINAL. SCHOOL THAT HAS WON THAT WORKS. ALTHOUGH IS THE HARD. BUT YOU. EVEN BEGIN. PROCESS IF YOU DON'T KNOW. TO DO WITH YOUR MONEY. IF YOU PUT IT ALL TOGETHER. YOU JUST. IT ON THE- THEN YOU DON'T KNOW WHY. NOT THAT. THAT IS YEAR. WHEN WE WERE DOING. I SAID THERE SHOULD BE QUALITATIVE. AND QUANTITATIVE DIFFERENCE AT THOSE SCHOOLS. WE SHOULD SEE MORE BUT WE SHOULD SEE A HIGHER QUALITY OF STUFF. THE GOALS OF THOSE SCHOOLS OF THOSE STUDENTS. WHO GETTING THE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE. AND THAT MY GOAL IS NOT TO TELL YOU HOW TO GET TO AND THINK WHAT YOU MAKING REFERENCE TO. I SAID IF AT THE END OF THE EVERYBODY HAS TO BE STANDING IN FRONT OF THE CAPITOL. AND YOU COMING FROM DIFFERENT PLACES I'M NOT GONNA TELL YOU WHAT YOU HAVE TO TAKE THE TROLLEY. WHAT DO YOU NEED TO DRIVE. WELL WITH THE NEED TO TAKE ABITE OF WHATEVER DEEPENING A WELL FAR YOU ARE. FROM THE CAPITAL WHERE YOU GOING. BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY IT IS NON NEGOTIABLE THAT YOU SHOULD BE IN FRONT OF THE CAPITOL. YOU KNOW HOW YOU GET THERE. THAT'S THE- CAN. YOU FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET THERE BASED ON THE STUDENTS. AND THE CHALLENGES YOU FACE AND WILL GIVE YOU EXTRA MONEY IF YOU GOT IF YOU COME FROM FURTHER WAY. AND IF YOU HAVE CLOSE. WITH GETTING TO THE CAPITAL. IS A NON NEGOTIABLE ISSUE. SWIM PROVING SOON PERFORMANCE IS NON NEGOTIABLE HOW YOU DO IT. THAT'S WHAT YOU HAVE A CONVERSATIONS AND THAT'S A LOCAL CONTROL. THANK YOU I'D LIKE TO QUICKLY JUST TOUCH BASE ON- LEVERAGE FELLOWS COMMENT AND THAT'S PART OF THE SYSTEM OF SUPPORT THERE IS TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE IN HIM THAT'S BEEN IMPROVING AND- I BELIEVE NOW WE HAVE A COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION WHO ARE PROVIDING THAT SUPPORT. AND EVEN AT THE STATE LEVEL WITH C. C. E. BEING- ESTABLISHED AND THE GOVERNOR HAS IDENTIFIED HAS PUT FUNDING IN HIS BUDGET SO THAT CC EAT CAN GO AROUND AND SHARE WE HAVE SUPPORT FOR YOU WE CAN PROVIDE YOU THAT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE SO. AGAIN WITH TIME AND WE ARE HOPEFUL THAT WILL START TO IDENTIFY. THOSE AREAS OF NEED AND FIGURING OUT HOW I'M WHAT BEST PRACTICES WE COULD USE TO- TO IMPROVE THE SERVICES. THANK YOU. THANK YOU RIGHT WELL THANK YOU GUYS FOR YOUR TESTIMONY FOR ANSWERING QUESTIONS APPRECIATE YOU GUYS BEING HERE THANK YOU RIGHT WHAT THAT WILL MOVE TO OUR NEXT PANEL THIS COMMENTS AND RESPONSES- FROM AUDITED SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND- SO WE HAVE WITH US MISS STEPHANIE.

ADDITIONAL TESTIMONY PLEASE A GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. I THINK YOU HAVE TO THE COMMITTEE IN YOUR STAFF FOR THEM ATTENTION TO. I RELATIONS FINE SO THE AUTO TO HIGHLIGHT SOME OF THE WORK THAT IS GOING ON AND SAN DIEGO UNIFIED. I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF SUPERINTENDENT MARTIN AND THE SAN DIEGO BOARD OF EDUCATION MY NAME IS SANDY GOT ROGER AND I'M THE DIRECTOR OF GOVERNMENT RELATIONS FOR SAN DIEGO UNIFIED- MY COMMENTS WILL FOCUS ON TWO KEY THEMES THE FIRST TEAM WILL ADDRESS THE FINDING SOME STATE AUDIT. AND THE SECOND WILL ADDRESS HOUSE BEAGLE UNIFIED IS LEADING THE WAY IN CALIFORNIA. SAN DIEGO UNIFIED IT'S A STRONG SUPPORTER OF THE EQUITY BASED FUNDING MODEL FOR CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA. FOR THIS REASON SAN DIEGO UNIFIED DEDICATED SIGNIFICANT STAFF TIME. AND RESOURCES OVER A PERIOD OF SIX MONTHS. TO ASSESS THE STATE AUDITOR'S OFFICE AND REVIEWING THE RESULTS IT IS IMPORTANT TO UNDERSCORE THAT THERE WERE NO FINDINGS OF NON COMPLIANCE. AGAINST SAN DIEGO UNIFIED AND OTHERS HERE AS WELL. IN FACT THE AUDIT FOUND THAT SAN DIEGO UNIFIED AT HERE'S TO THE PRACTICE. OF SPENDING ANY CARRY OVER SUPPLEMENTING CONCENTRATION FUNDS. FROM ONE YEAR FIRST SUPPLEMENT ON CONCENTRATION ACTIVITIES. THE FOLLOWING YEAR. THE MOST IMPORTANT ISSUE RATES BY THE AUDIT REGARDING THE UNDER REPORTING OF THAT SINCE THE EXPENSES WHAT'S FROM THE IMPLEMENTATION PERIOD. AND THIS ISSUE HAS BEEN RESOLVED AND IT'S NO LONGER APPLICABLE UNDER ALTHEA PFAFF. WHILE WE APPRECIATE THE FINDINGS AN IMPORTANT DISTINCTION TO MAKE ABOUT THE IDEA. IS THAT THE FOCUS WAS ON THE INPUTS AND NOT ON STUDENT OUTCOMES. AND YOU IN A FIGHT TO. F. TO STRING LCF. IMPROVE TRANSIT. AND TO PROMOTE CULTURE FOCUS ON. OUT IN YOUTH. AND WE SUPPORTED STATE EVENT. RESEARCH ACTIONS WHICH A DOT MY CATION THE L. K. THAT IMPROVE TREND. AND. WE BELIEVE IT IS IMPORTANT TO EXAMINE POTENTIAL F. REFORMS TO ALTHEA FIVE WITHIN A FRAMEWORK THAT PRIORITIZES IMPROVING STUDENT OUTCOMES AND THE AL CAPP RATHER THAN RETURNING TO CATEGORICAL IS TO SUMMARIZE WE AGREE WITH MANY OF THE FINDINGS OF THE STATE AUDIT WHICH AFFIRMS THAT SAN DIEGO UNIFIED. HAS COMPLIED WITH LC A FIVE AND A COLLEGES THE SHORTCOMINGS OF THE STATE'S APPROACH TO PROVIDE SIGNIFICANT FUNDING TO CLOSE STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT GAPS. THE SECOND THEME HIGHLIGHTS HOW SAN DIEGO UNIFIED IT'S LEADING THE WAY ON STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT SAN DIEGO UNIFIED SERVES A HUNDRED THREE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED SIXTEEN STUDENTS. ARE UNDER THE CARE OF PERCENTAGE OF SIXTY POINT EIGHT PERCENT. AND WE RECEIVE ABOUT A HUNDRED TWENTY THREE MILLION FOR THE PURPOSES OF SUPPLEMENTING CONCENTRATION GRANT FUNDS- ARE YOU SEE A TO G. COMPLETION RATES WITH THE C. GRADE- AT GRADUATION HAVE INCREASED FOR LOW INCOME YOUTH FROM 40% AND TWENTY THIRTEEN. LEARNERS THE UC EIGHT THROUGH G. COMPLETION RATES WITH THE C. GRAIN AT GRADUATION HAVING COOKIES FROM 11% IN TWENTY THIRTEEN. 53% TWENTY NINETEEN. GRAD RATE IS EIGHTY NINE POINT BUT LET ME BE HERE THIS IS NOT TO SUGGEST THAT THE WORK OF IMPROVING SUSPENDED CHIEF IS ANYWHERE BEING DONE WHAT WERE YOU IF WE NOT DONE BUT RATHER. WE ARE MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION UNDER WRAPS THE A FIVE IN FACT SEVERAL NOTABLE RESEARCH INSTITUTIONS HAVE DOCUMENTED THAT ACT WORK. IT'S AT SAN DIEGO UNIFIED. YOU CENTER FOR THE- OF SCHOOL FOR EXAMPLE COMPLETED A CASE TO ON SAN DIEGO YOU. THIS PAST YEAR WHICH DEMONSTRATED THAT THE EFFECTIVE USE OF LCF FUNDS IS DRIVING IMPROVEMENTS IN OUTCOMES FOR ON DUPLICATED STUDENTS. ANOTHER CASE STUDY ON SAN DIEGO UNIFIED BY THE LEARNING POLICY INSTITUTE COMPLETED IN TWENTY NINETEEN. FOUND THAT THE STRONG COMMITMENT TO INSTRUCTIONAL IMPROVEMENT IN A SYSTEM OF HOLISTIC STUDENT SUPPORT ITS BOWSTRING STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT. BEFORE I CONCLUDE I WANT TO LEAVE YOU WITH SOME VERY IMPORTANT INFORMATION- SAN DIEGO UNIFIED IT'S THE SECOND LARGEST SCHOOL DISTRICT IN CALIFORNIA. ACCORDING TO THE NATIONAL CENTER FOR EDUCATION STATISTICS SAN DIEGO UNIFIED SERVE THE STUDENT POPULATION THAT IT'S COMPARATO TO THE STATE OF WYOMING VERMONT IN NORTH DAKOTA. GET THESE STATES HAVE HIGHER PER STUDENT FUNDING LEVELS IN CALIFORNIA ACCORDING TO EDUCATION WEEK RESEARCH CENTER AS PUBLISHED IN TWENTY NINETEEN. VERMONT SPENDS TWENTY THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED PER STUDENT WYOMING SPENT EIGHTEEN THOUSAND NINETY PER STUDENT AND NORTH DAKOTA SPENDS FOURTEEN THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY ONE PER STUDENT. CALIFORNIA SPENDS ABOUT TEN THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY ONE PER STUDENT. BELOW THE NATIONAL AVERAGE OF TWELVE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY SIX PER STUDENT. TO SUMMARIZE SAN DIEGO UNIFIED HAS MAXIMIZE THE INTENT OF ALTHEA FAT. WHILE THE AUDIT HAS PROVIDED A STRONG UNDERSTANDING OF HOW THE STATE IMPLEMENTED ALTHEA FIVE. MOVING FORWARD WE SUGGEST A FOCUS ON INVESTING AN LCI FIVE TO ACCELERATE STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT I WILL CLOSE BY QUOTING THE LEARNING POLICY INSTITUTES REPORT TITLED THE CALIFORNIA WAY WHICH STATES IN RELATION TO ALTHEA FIVE CONTINUE PROGRESS WILL DEPEND ON DEEPENING THE STRATEGIES AND INVESTMENTS. AS WELL AS THE FOCUSED EFFORT TO BUILD THE CAPACITY OF EVERYONE IN THE SYSTEM. YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU. THANK YOU PLEASE. GOOD AFTERNOON MR AT GERMAN AND pASSOCIATE SUPERINTENDENT FOR SCHOOL LEADERSHIP OF CULTURE BY SCHOOL DISTRICT ON BEHALF OUR SUPERINTENDENT AFTER MIL FOR ROLAND. AND THE CLOVER STARBOARD OF EDUCATION AND WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY COMES BECAUSE WELL AND- IN A STRANGE WAY ALSO THANK TO JORDAN THANKS FOR A HIS PRESENCE IN OUR DISTRICT AFTER THE MONTHS AND HE WAS THERE AND REALLY ENABLING US TO REALLY TAKE A DEEP DIVE LOOK INTO- THE- CAT- EL CAP AND AN ACCOUNTABILITY SYSTEM- I WOULD ECHO A LOT OF BUT MISTER ROGERS JUST SAID ABOUT THE ACTUAL FINDING. IN THE POLICIES OUT WHEN I HAVE THE RIGHT OF THOSE I REALLY DO BELIEVE THAT THIS HAS GIVEN US A REALLY CLEAR GLASS REVIEW OF WHAT IS BEING. OF AT AND IMPROVED THE COMPLETION OF THE EL CAP PROCESS- HAS BEEN SIX YEARS OF CHANGES IN DIFFERENT- TEMPLATES AND THOSE SORTS I THINK WE HAVE WORKED CLOSELY WITH ROSS COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION STATE MORTGAGE GEN. AND HOW BEST TO COMPLETE THAT- AS A SCHOOL DISTRICT WE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN ABOUT ACCOUNTABILITY SER SIXTIETH YEAR AND WE GET ENTERING OUR SIX IF YOUR PRACTICE ACCOUNTABILITY IS NOTHING WE'VE EVER TRIED A WAVE I'M WE LIKE TO KNOW WHAT THE WHAT CAN BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR ANY. HOW TO WOMEN AND BILL FOR THAT AND SO WE DO A OKAY THAPAR DETERIORATE THROUGH NO FAULT. I CAN STATE LAWS FOR THE CLOSED BY SWITCH BECAUSE- WE ARE DIFFERENT SCHOOL DISTRICT- WE ARE LARGE AS AS MUCH RIGHT AT THE WHY WE'RE WHICH ESSENTIAL. WE DO NOT LEAVE ANY. SITUATION I'M SORRY RIP YEAH BUT- MANY CONCENTRATION FUNDS. JUST SUPPLEMENTAL. WHETHER YOU PP OF A FORTY. PERCENT CURRENTLY. IT'S BEEN IN EACH. AS OUR- INCREASES AND WE ARE GROWING SCHOOL DISTRICT THERE'S NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT. WE HAVE A GRADUATION RATE OF NINETY FOUR POINT 4% AND WE REALLY HAVE. TRY TO INCREASE WITH OUR SERVICES- UTILIZING THE ALL CAPS ALL OF SERVICES TO THE UCBCP- STUDENTS THAT- REALLY THAT MNEY WAS. BEING DIRECTED TOWARDS AND WE THINK WE HAVE SEEN. AN ACHIEVEMENT GAP CLOSURE NOT THE RATE THAT I THINK ANYBODY WOULD BE HAPPY WITH THEM WE'RE NEVER HAPPY WITH THAT WE ALWAYS WANT TO SEE. OF OUR STUDENTS EXCEEDING. THINK THAT PLAN REALLY HELPED US. I DO THAT- THE AUDIT DID COMMAND CLOVIS UNIFIED VIRGINAL TRACKING OF OUR SUPPLEMENTAL FUNDS WHICH I THINK HAS BEEN A CHALLENGE. I KNOW IN SOME DISTRICTS. AND ARSES TO PRINT AND IF- BUSINESS SOURCES SOON RUTLEDGE REALLY CREATE A SYSTEM WHERE WE COULD TRACK. THOSE FUNDS. IN I THINK WE ARE COMMITTED FOR THAT IN THE AUDIT AND I THINK IT HAS HELPED US. AT LEAST DETERMINE- THAT WE DO ACKNOWLEDGE THE DIRECT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE SERVICES. AND THE OUTCOMES AS BEING H. H. WE ACTUALLY CREATE OUR OWN INTERNAL. OUR PROGRAM IS ACTUALLY CREE OWN. AUDITING SO. TO REDUCE THE DASH. AS WAS COMMON BEFORE WE'VE HAD THE DASH WORK FOR TWO YEARS. AND WHAT WE HAVE REALLY BEEN ABLE TRYING TO DETERMINE IS EXACTLY WHAT STUDENTS THAT WERE FOCUSING ON AND HOW DO WE SEE NOT JUST AT THE END OF THE YEAR. BUT ALSO ON GOING THE THROUGHOUT THE YEAR AS WE WOULD WITH ACADEMIC ASSESSMENTS. AND ACHIEVEMENT YOU DON'T JUST WAIT TO THE END OF THE YEAR TO SEE HOW WELL THE STUDENTS DID YOUR MONITORING PROGRESS ALL THROUGH. AND SO WE HAVE DONE THE SAME WITH THAT- I THINK THE FLEXIBILITY WITHIN THE CALIFORNIA STARS ACCOUNT CODE STRUCTURE IS FALSELY SOMETHING THAT. CAN BE UTILIZED BUT IT'S A CHALLENGE THERE'S NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT. FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO NOT BE ABLE TO MONITOR THOSE- THE U. OVER HAS BEEN COMMENTED BEFORE- THE WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO TRACK CARRY OVER AND HOW IT'S BEING SPENT BUT WE ALSO WELCOME THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE- OF THE STATE AUDITOR'S OFFICE AND WE CAN- DO A MUCH BETTER JOB AS I AS WE ALL KIND OF MAKING SURE THAT DOES GO DIRECTLY BACK TO THE STUDENTS- FOR WHICH THE FUNDS WERE. AGAIN THAT WASN'T HOW THE LAW WAS WRITTEN- BUT WE'VE ALWAYS MADE THAT A PRIORITY OF OUR CARRYOVER FUNDS TO GO BACK TO SOURCES THAT MAYBE WE WANT TO SET TO. PROVIDE MORE FUNDING FOR THAT WE WERE SEEING GROWTH IN. AND I WOULD SAY THAT- AS THE FUNDING QUESTION THAT THAT MR ROACH JUST. JUST GEN WE ARE THE LOW FUND WELL THIS. AND FRESNO WE ARE THE SECOND LARGEST OVER THE FOR PERSONS EXPERT SECOND LARGEST BUT THE LOWEST. THE QUESTION THE CAME UP EARLIER NOW. THERE'S A WHOLE. SECTION CAN HAD ABOUT. BUT WE DO APPRECIATE BEING A THE TABLE AND BEING. OF CITED. BEING PART HOPEFULLY THE SOLUTIONS WELL. THANK YOU. PLEASE GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS DOCTOR SANDRA YOU THAT I'M THE CHIEF ACKERMAN. ACADEMIC OFFICER FOR THE OAKLAND UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT. I'VE WORKED IN OAKLAND FOR OVER TWENTY YEARS. I'VE HELD VARIOUS ROLES INCLUDING TEACHER PRINCIPAL IN CENTRAL OFFICE LEADER. AS THE CHIEF ACADEMIC OFFICER RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF OUR LOCAL CONTROL AND ACCOUNTABILITY PLAN. WHICH INCLUDES STAKEHOLDER AND COMMUNITY OUTREACH. AND INPUT THAT GUIDES THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE DISTRICT'S GOALS AND INVESTMENTS. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO PROVIDE A CONTEXT FOR THE WORK OUR DISTRICT AND- ACHES EACH YEAR TO ADDRESS OUR STUDENTS AND COMMUNITY NEEDS. WITH AN EYE TOWARD IMPROVING LEARNING. AND ACADEMIC OUTCOMES. TO BEGIN OUR DISTRICT HAS A HIGH PERCENTAGE OF HIGH NEEDS. GIVING DEFINED BY OUR AND DUPLICATED PEOPLE COUNT. THE PERCENT OF STUDENTS IN OUR DISTRICT TO OUR THOUGH INCOME OUR LANGUAGE. LEARNERS ARE FOR. YOUTH IS WE SET A PER. STRAIGHT TO NEED IN THE COST. AS I'D AT IT IS BASS. AS WE CONTENT. TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS ACROSS THE DISH MEET. TO THE SEEK HOW LEVERAGE INVESTED. THAT DELIVER PROGRAMS AND SERVICES WITH THE BROADEST REACH. EVEN WITH OUR LOCAL PARCEL TAXES THAT OUR COMMUNITY HAS CONSISTENTLY AND GENEROUSLY SUPPORTED OVER THE YEARS TO HELP US DELIVER THE HIGHEST QUALITY EDUCATION FOR STUDENTS. THE CHALLENGES WE FACE AT THE DISTRICT AND THE CHALLENGES OUR STUDENTS CONFRONT EACH DAY ARE SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE OFTEN ARE NEEDS OUTPACE OUR RESOURCES. AND OUR OAKLAND COMMUNITY OUR EDUCATIONAL LEADERS ARE COMPELLED TO THINK ABOUT SERVICES BEYOND THE CLASSROOM AND BEYOND OUR CAMPUS GATES. WE MUST CONSIDER THE FOOD AND HOUSING AND SECURITIES OUR STUDENTS CARRY. WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THEIR PHYSICAL SAFETY AND HEALTH AND ABOUT THEIR ACCESS TO CARE. WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THESE VITAL ASPECTS OF OUR STUDENTS LIES AND HOW TO ADDRESS THEM BECAUSE THESE FIVE CIRCUMSTANCES AFFECT THE ABILITY OF OUR STUDENTS TO LEARN AND FEEL SAFE. WE ARE PROUD OF THE INVESTMENTS WE'VE MADE AN OPEN. PROGRAMS LIKE OUR COMMUNITY SCHOOLS THAT INTEGRATE ACADEMICS WITH HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICES. RESTORATIVE JUSTICE IN SCHOOL BASED HEALTH SERVICES ARE AIMED AT MEETING MANY OF THE OUT OF SCHOOL NEEDS OUR STUDENTS HAVE. ADDITIONALLY WE CONTINUE TO EXPAND A PROMOTE EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS ME NO WORK FOR OUR STUDENTS BY CAR LINKED LEARNING PATHWAY PROGRAMS. THAT HAVE PROVEN TO INCREASE THE GRADUATION GRADUATION RATES FOR STUDENTS. ME EXPAND OUR EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS WITH CONTINUE LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES IN OUR AFTER SCHOOL AND SUMMER LEARNING PROGRAMS. WE KNOW THAT THE CRITICAL INVESTMENTS HELP TO ENSURE THAT OUR STUDENTS CAN THRIVE WE ALSO AIM TO SUPPORT OUR TEACHERS. NOT JUST WORKING TO INCREASE COMPENSATION BUT ALSO BY CONSTANTLY WORKING ON IMPROVE TEACHING AND LEARNING DITIONS. THROUGH OUR FOCUS ON PROFESSIONAL LEARNING COMMUNITIES AND OUR MENTOR TEACHER PROGRAM. WE KNOW THAT WE CALL TEACHERS THE MOST CRITICAL RESOURCE FOR STUDENT LEARNING. WE FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT THESE ARE THE RIGHT INVESTMENTS FOR OUR STUDENTS AND THE COMMUNITY RESEARCH. I WANT TO ECHO THE COMMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUES HAVE UNDERSCORED THAT WE HAVE COMPLIED WITH ALL STATE REQUIREMENTS AND WE HAVE INSTITUTED A LOCAL MEASURE TO TRACK OUR L. CFF FUNDS TO IMPROVE ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY OVER OUR ANNUAL INVESTMENTS BY ADOPTING A NEW FISCAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM. I LIKE TO END BY SAYING THAT WE BECOME EDUCATORS BECAUSE WE WANT TO SERVE KIDS AND SUPPORT THEM TO SIXTY. YOU WANNA BREAK CYCLES THAT ARE PREDICTABLE FOR LOW INCOME STUDENTS AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDENTS LATINO STUDENTS SOUTHEAST ASIAN STUDENTS ARE LANGUAGE LEARNERS AND OUR STUDENTS FOR THIS FROM SUCCESS. BREAKING PREDICTABLE CYCLES THE MOTIVATION BEHIND EVERYTHING WE DO AND EVERY INVESTMENT YOU MAKE FOR OUR STUDENTS OF OAKLAND. BUT WE DO SO KNOWING THAT EDUCATION IS NESTED. IN A LARGER COMMUNITY CONTEXT THAT IN OAKLAND MEANS TAKING A WHOLE CHILD APPROACH TO CREATING CONDITIONS FOR STUDENTS TO THRIVE IN SIXTEEN. THANK YOU THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR THE TESTIMONY FOR **** LET ME HAVE. LET ME JUST BEGIN WITH THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS USER ALL ALL TALKING ABOUT ACCOUNTABILITY AND THINK FROM CLOVIS YOU SAID YOU PRIDE YOURSELF ON THE ACCOUNTABILITY. WHEN YOU DO YOUR ACCOUNTABILITY IS AT BASED OFF OF THE EL CAP TEMPLATE ARE YOU DOING MEASURES ABOVE AND BEYOND- DEPENDING ON WHAT PARENTS OR STUDENT GROUPS ARE ASKING FOR. YEAH COMMENT ON THAT NO I THINK I'M WE HAVE AN INTERNAL WE CALL IT A CLASSY AN INTERNAL ACCOUNTING ABILITY SYSTEM THAT REALLY TAKES ACCOUNT- ALL STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT AND ALL CATEGORIES IT TAKES A CAN. STEP PARENT PARTICIPATION- LOTS OF DIFFERENT ITEMS SPECIFICALLY TO THE EL CAP- THE ACCOUNTABILITY THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT IS WITH THOSE SPECIFIC SUBGROUPS ARE WE HITTING OUR GOALS WHICH IS INCREASE STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT THE STUDENT AND- I'M- AS OF MY FRIEND FROM OPEN JUST KIND OF SET IT THE WHOLE CHILD CONCEPT. HI THIS IS JUST A SET WORKER FOR CHIEF MENTOR- OR X. AND OF THE FORUMS- I SO I THINK THAT IS WHERE WE ARE ALWAYS TRYING TO LOOK BACK AT OUR SYSTEM OF HAS THE PROGRAM SYSTEM WE PLACE. EATING THE NEEDS OF MOST NEEDY STUDENTS AND THAT IS FEEDBACK. FROM STUDENT IN A PROCUREMENT. EXPOSURE TO ADD TO THAT AYE AYE WE JUST SAY IN TERMS OF SANDY UNION THE CAPEN DEFINITELY FRAME TO HAVE A LOT OF THESE COMMERCE IN TO ATTEND AREAS TO AND BASS WE ALL USE THE I'VE- REMEMBERING THE ACRONYM THE S. P. AS SAY THE SCHOOL PLAN FOR STUDENT. ACHIEVEMENT PAN OUR PRINCIPLES USE THAT IN COORDINATION AND COLLABORATION WITH OUR PARENTS AT THE SCHOOL SITE BUT THEN A FIGHT NEEDS SPECIFICALLY RELATED TO STUDENTS AT THAT SCHOOL SIDE AND SAN DIEGO UNIFIED WE ALSO HAVE VISION TWENTY TWENTY WHICH WE WILL BE UPDATING WHICH IS OUR STRATEGIC VISIONARY STOCK. THE HELP PROPEL TO WHERE WE WANT TO GET TO WITH STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT AS WELL GOT IT. THANK YOU. PLEASE GIVE ME ONE JUST COMMENT IN AND BEING THAT NON. CONCENTRATED BUT IT JUST. IN THE GROUP IS ONE OF ONE OF THE CHALLENGES THAT I WILL JUST ACKNOWLEDGES THAT WE HAVE FOURTEEN SCHOOLS IN OUR DISTRICT THAT ACTUALLY HAVE- WOULD QUALIFY FOR CONCENTRATION FUNDING AND SO. THOSE CHALLENGES WE HAVE WE DON'T MAKE THAT SIX AS WE HAVE NO EXCUSES OR ANYTHING OF THAT SORT I THINK WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT SORT OF THOSE SOME OF THOSE CHALLENGES WITH THEM WITHIN THE DISTRICT UNDER NINETY SQUARE MILES IN PROBABLY ALL OF THE DISTRICTS YOU'RE GONNA HAVE ONE INTO THE DISTRICT THAT HAS OF LOW YOU PP COUNT AND THE OTHERS THAT ARE. THAT ARE MUCH HIGHER AGAINST THE WHEN YOU DON'T RECEIVE THIS ONE THAT'S A LITTLE BIT OF A DIFFERENT LOOK AS WELL TO CUT IT. I'M DOESN'T THE DEPARTMENT REQUIRE YOU GUYS NOT TO. OR TO DO SOMETHING WITH THE PP SO YOU'RE DOUBLE CAL STUDENTS. RESERVE THAT ALREADY INHERENTLY BILTON THAT IS ALREADY INHERENTLY BUILT IN BUT THE- SO IN OTHER WORDS I GUESS IF IT WAS FUNDED BY SCHOOL RATHER THAN MY DISTRICT WE HAVE FOURTEEN SCHOOLS RECEIVING CONCENTRATION FUNDING. GOT IT. ALL RIGHT- LET ME JUST ASK CITY SO. YOU KNOW SOME OF THE SCHOOL OBVIOUSLY ARE DOING SOMETHINGS BEYOND THE EL CAP. BASS LINE I GUESS ARE BEYOND THE TEMPLATE I MEAN THERE ARE YOU GUYS LOOKING AT TWITCH WORKING GROUP'S BECAUSE I'VE LEVY COMMENTED ON HAVING THE WORKING GROUP'S. IS THIS SOMETHING THAT YOU'RE PUSHING FOR WITH THE STATE BOARD AT HOW DO WE INCLUDE SOME OF THESE OTHER MEASURES TO INCREASE AT ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY THAT'S- THAT EVEN SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE HEARING FOR. WELL I'VE SAY SORRY DASHBOARD HAS MULTIPLE MEASURES INDICATORS. IT'S NOT JUST AROUND STUDENT ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT YOU HAVE CHRONIC ABSENTEEISM RATE YOU HAVE SUSPENSION IT YOU HAVE MULTIPLE MEASURES SO ARE ACCOUNTABILITY SYSTEM IS NOT CONTINGENT ON JUST. ONE MEASURE IT'S MULTIPLE. AS OUR COLLEAGUE FROM CLOSE YOU TALKED ABOUT YOUR PARENT ENGAGEMENT. ON CALL CLAYTON SCHOOL AND CULTURE ARE ALL OF THE INDICATORS WITHIN THE DASHBOARD AND SO WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE L. COP IS JUST ONE PIECE OF THE PUZZLE. FOR OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND FOR US AS THE DEPARTMENT IN OUR SUPPORT TO OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN OUR COUNTY OFFICES WE HAVE THE YOU KNOW LIKE I SAID THE DASHBOARD WE HAVE THE- THE STATE WIDE SYSTEM A SUPPORT WHERE WERE PARTNERS WITH THE CALIFORNIA COLLABORATIVE FOR EDUCATIONAL EXCELLENCE. AND WE ARE WE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR PROVIDING THE SUPPORT TO OUR DISTRICTS WERE STRUGGLING WITH PROVIDING THAT FIRST HIGH QUALITY EXPERIENCE TO THEIR STUDENTS FROM THEIR LEVEL ONE SORT RESOURCES. AND SO AGAIN THEY'LL CAP IS JUST ONE PIECE OF A VERY LARGE PUZZLE AROUND WHAT ARE DISTRICTS AND WHAT THE- IS. GOT IT. YEAH I APPRECIATE THAT FOR THE FOR BASS THAT AS BECAUSE IT SAID SOLD PEOPLE. OF GEAR FROM STATE OUT AND YES PANEL THEY WERE ME ABOUT HOW DO WE DO THIS A- DASH FOR SOME OF THE- ARE STILL OF THE- TARGETED. LOOKING FOR. GAYS YET HOW TO ALIGN THE IN THE WERE SEVEN CAN WEEKS SOMETHING FROM CITY IN AND THIS AND THIS SO IT DOES IS A LIE. SO I WANTED TO SOME OF THE- WHIMS AUDITOR AT SAID SO REGARDING THAT THE ALL CROP IN THE DASHBOARD THE STEPS STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION ADOPTS THE% CRITERIA FOR THE DASHBOARD AND THE COP. THE C. D. E. RESOURCES IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PROVIDING THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND SUPPORT AROUND THE DASHBOARD IN ALL CAPS WE ALSO DO THE DAY TO DAY PROCESS THE PROCESSING OF ALL THE DATA BEHIND THE DASH BOARD. SO IT IS A SHARED PARTNERSHIP WITH THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION AND THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND SO WHAT YOU SEE WITHIN THE DASHBOARD IS WE HAVE MULTIPLE STUDENT GROUPS WITHIN THE DASHBOARD SO SCHOOLS CAN GO IN AND SEE OUR ACTUALLY ANYBODY. WE ALSO HAVE A DASHBOARD APP YOU CAN GET ON MY OWN MMHM A WOULD YOU ANYBODY CAN GO IN AND SEE HOW THEIR ENGLISH LEARNERS ARE DOING RATHER FOSTER YOUTH ARE DOING SO THERE IS A LINE MEANT FROM THE I'LL COP TO THE DASHBOARD ALREADY CONCERNED THAT DASHBOARD IF I'M LOOKING AT ENGLISH LEARNERS LIKE YOU SPECIFIED. BUT I BE ABLE TO SEE THE ALLOCATION FROM THE LCF THE SUPPLEMENTAL FUNDS NOW IT THE DASHBOARD DOES NOT HOLD FISCAL INFORMATION. OKAY SO IF I WERE. TO SEE THAT. MORE WHAT I THAT WERE THAT BE THE- IS THAT WHY WE'RE REDOING THE EL CAP. TO THE STATE BOARD OR- THERE IS THE- CAT BUT WE ALSO HAVE ANOTHER DATA SOURCE FOR OFFICE INFORMATION FOR. US YES ARE THROUGH OUR SCHOOL FACILITY OUR SCHOOLS WILL SLOWLY SKEWS ME SCHOOL FISCAL SERVICES DIVISION WE ACTUALLY HAVE. A PORTION ON OUR WEB. OUR WEB PAGE THAT ACTUALLY HAS THE SPECIFIC INFORMATION ON WHAT THE APPORTIONMENT ARE FOR EACH DISTRICT H. L. EA. SO IT DOES BREAK IT DOWN. OKAY AND SO. ARE MY BATH FOLLOW UP WITH THE AUDITOR NOW. ARE CAN YOU COME UP. WITH OKAY. THIS BUT- THE- ONE TEACHERS. FOR OKAY SIGNATURE HELP ME WITH THE DISCREPANCY HERE PLEASE. YEAH SO THE DIFFERENTIATION THAT WE'RE MAKING IS WERE WERE INTERESTED IN IN SEEING A CONNECTION BETWEEN THE SPENDING THAT'S OCCURRING AND THE DASHBOARD AND SHE'S ABSOLUTELY RIGHT IN THE IN THE EL CAP TEMPLATE AS IT EXISTS THE DISTRICT IS IDENTIFYING FOR EACH GOAL THAT THEY INCLUDE. WHAT STATE PRIORITIES ARE THOSE GOALS INTENDED TO ACHIEVE SO THERE'S THAT ALIGNMENT. AT IT AT THE HIGHER GOAL LEVEL WHAT WE'RE INTERESTED IN FINDING OUT AND HAVING MORE INFORMATION ABOUT IS THE SERVICES THAT YOU'RE- INTENDING TO FIND IN THAT YOU ACTUALLY DO SPEND MONEY ON. HOW TO THOSE SERVICES ALIGNED WITH THE PARTICULAR DASHBOARD INDICATOR SO AGAIN IF YOU'RE SEEING EITHER PROGRESS IN A PARTICULAR INDICATOR CAN SOMEONE TRACK BACK AND SEE WHAT WAS DONE THAT'S THAT'S LEADING TO THAT SUCCESS AND THEN CHAMPION IT AND CONTINUE TO FUND IT. ON THE OTHER HAND IF YOU'RE NOT SEEN PROGRESS IN A PARTICULAR INDICATOR HOW DO YOU TRACK BACK AND FIND OUT WHAT ARE THOSE INEFFECTIVE SERVICES HOW CAN WE MOVE OUR FUNDING. FROM THOSE THINGS THAT AREN'T RESULTING IN IN PROGRESS TO SOMETHING THAT PERHAPS THIS AGAIN IT'S TO ENABLE THIS CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT APPROACH. ADDITIONAL DATA WILL HELP. STAKEHOLDERS MAKE THOSE DECISIONS AND SO JUST TO ADD ON TO THAT IF YOU SEE AN EXPENDITURE TABLES SHEET THAT I PROVIDED YOU YOU WILL SEE IN THE NEW CAP THAT WAS ADOPTED BY THE STATE BOARD ON JANUARY EIGHTH THAT STUDENT GROUPS LCF FUNDS. AN INCREASE WHETHER OR NOT THE SERVICES PROVIDED INCREASED OR IMPROVE SERVICES FOR THEIR STUDENTS IS HOUSE WITHIN THE EXPENDITURE TABLE SO THAT INFORMATION IS ALL THERE. AND THEN SOMEBODY COULD GO AND LOOK AND SEE HOW THE SCHOOL IS PERFORMING ON THE DASHBOARD. CON AND SO FAR MY A BECAUSE YOU KNOW I HAVE- GROUPS BACK HOME. THEY'VE HAD THIS FIGHT IT THINK THE LAST TWO YEARS WITH THE SCHOOL DISTRICT. HOW WOULD THEY BE ABLE TO FOR THE CENTER THIS THROUGH THE WEB. OR JUST THROUGH. HOW THEY BE ABLE TO. SUBGROUPS LOOKING AT EAGLE SWEARS THE CIVIC LEE. AND TRY TO SEE THE MONEY THAT'S ALLOCATED FOR THEM AND HOW IT'S BEING SPENT SO YOU'RE SAYING IT'S AVAILABLE WHILE YOU THEY'LL CULTURAL SLURS AVAILABLE ON THE DASHBOARD. THE FISCAL PART OF IT IS AVAILABLE ON ANOTHER WEBSITE IT'S A ALL CD WEBSITE BUT ALSO ARGUING WEBSITE. GOT IT AND FROM THE OUTER WE'RE JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT ARE THE IMPROVEMENTS OVER THE YEARS. AND THAT IS WITHIN THE EL CAP TEMPLATE THAT'S IN THE NEW EL CAP NEW LAND THERE THAT JUST CAME OUT TWO WEEKS AGO YES RIGHT GOT IT AND THEN WE'RE EXPECTING FROM THE STATE BOARD. EXPECTING ADDITIONAL TRANSPARENCY ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES AND HOPEFULLY SOME- TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE FOR THE MEMBERS OF THE- OKAY. YEAH THANK YOU. I APPRECIATE THAT. I HAVE A DISTAL QUESTIONS BUT- THIS QUIRK SILVA PLEASE. FIRST TO DR EDU LARA- THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS BECAUSE I CAN TELL HOW EMOTIONAL IT IS AND YOU KNOW I THINK WE ALL SHOULD BE EMOTIONAL ABOUT THE OUTCOMES FOR OUR STUDENTS AND IT ISN'T JUST THE SUPPLEMENT STUDENTS IT'S FOR ALL OF THEM WE AS PARENTS AND AS- EDUCATORS AND TAXPAYERS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WANT TO SEE OUR STUDENTS ACHIEVE BOTTOM LINE. AND THERE'S MULTIPLE MEASURES FOR THAT LIKE YOU SAID IT ISN'T JUST ON ACADEMICS IT'S ON THERE SO MANY THINGS ARE FAMILIES AND STUDENTS ARE IN A NOT ONLY NOW BUT IN THE PAST. ONE TO SAY THAT BIG THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE IN OUT THERE I NO WAY ASK FOR THIS AUDIT BECAUSE I DON'T BELIEVE GOOD WORK IS BEING HAVE HAPPENING OUT THERE AND ALSO I IN NO WAY BELIEVE IT'S EASY TO TAKE SOMETHING AT THAT HAS BEEN SYSTEMIC FOR DECADES AND ALL OF A SUDDEN- CHANGE OUTCOMES SO WELL OVER TEN YEARS AGO BEFORE I WAS EVEN UP HERE AS A TEACHER IN MY SCHOOL DISTRICT I WAS ALSO AT THE SAME TIME AIR OF FULLER AND IN WE TRIED TO JUST LOCALLY LOOK AT CHIEF AND GAP THIS IS TWO YEARS AGO OR MORE. MAYBE EVEN TWELVE IN THAT POINT WE COULD ACKNOWLEDGEMENT THERE WAS AN ACHIEVEMENT GAP SO WE'VE MOVED QUITE FAR IN THAT SENSE THAT I THINK THE COMMON- DISCUSSION IS YES THERE IS A PERSISTENT ACHIEVEMENT GAP HOW'D WHO TACKLE IT THE EVERYTHING FROM LIKE WE SAID ON SELECTED TO READ INTERVIEW. TO OF YOU KNOW SO MANY THINGS COME THAT COME IN INCOME OUT OF EDUCATION I FOR ONE WOULD TO SEE FRIDAY COME BACK UP BECAUSE I KNOW SO THE THING IT'S AND BUT THAT'S MY LOOK THAT'S MY LITTLE THING I KNOW- OF THERE'S LOTS OF RESEARCH THAT SAYS IT DOES MAKE A DIFFERENCE BUT THAT BEING SAID IT IS BECAUSE I DON'T BELIEVE EVERY SCHOOL THAT SAYS THAT THEY'RE TRYING TO DO BEST BUT WHEN YOU MENTION LIGHT NOW WE NEED TO AB IT HARD FOR PARENTS. YOU'RE NOT DOING IT RIGHT OR OR WE DON'T LIKE WHAT YOU'RE DOING WE'RE JUST TRYING TO SAY IF YOU'RE A PARENT AND FOR MANY PARENTS WHO DON'T SPEAK ENGLISH HOW DO YOU GET THE BEST INFORMATION BUT THE SECOND PART OF THAT IS IN THAT LONG- TECHNOLOGY QUESTION I HAD RELATED TO IPADS AND STUFF IT'S REALLY ACROSS THE STATE EVEN IF WE HADN'T ASKED FOR THE AUDIT- WITH ALL THE WORK CAN WE START TO SEE TRENDS THAT WE KNOW OUR BEST PRACTICES. REALLY DO WORK SO THAT I LIKE IS THERE A WAY TO START TO COMMUNICATE THAT SO THAT IF WE SAY WE WANT EVERYBODY AS DOCTOR LEPPARD SAID AT THE CAPITOL BY THIS TIME AND WE'RE TRYING ALL THESE DIFFERENT THINGS AND EVERYBODY HAS THEIR KINDA LIKE LITTLE SPECIAL THING HAVE WE SEEN ANY OVER LINE. TRACK THAT REALLY HAS CHAU WHEN THE GROWTH- AND I'M TALKING REALLY MAYBE K. EIGHT BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE WE SEE THAT IF STUDENTS AREN'T ACHIEVING. LIKE ONE OF THE INDICATORS IS READING BY THIRD GRADE THEN YOU'RE GOING TO START TO SEE THAT FALL OFF THEY'RE NOT LEARNING- THEY'VE BEEN HERE FOR MANY YEARS AND THEN THEY'RE NOT MOVING OUT OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE PROGRAMS. SO I GUESS THAT'S MY QUESTION ARE THERE TRENDS OR PRACTICES THAT WE JUST REALLY NO WORK AND IF THERE ARE CAN THOSE BE COMMUNICATED. DISTRICTS WITH. A SUGGESTION NOT A MANDATE SO THAT WE AREN'T USING HUGE AMOUNT OF ROUGH AT REVENUE ON ALL KINDS OF THINGS BECAUSE THEY'RE INTERESTING BUT WE HAVEN'T SEEN THAT THEY WORK. YEAH SO THERE'S A THERE'S A QUITE A BIT OF BEST PRACTICE OUT THERE. WHEN THE MEMBER ABOUT BUT PRACTICE IS THE A BEST JUSTIN OPEN. MAY NOT BE THE BEST PRACTICE FOR CLUB S. UNIFIED AND SO IT IS ROLE IS THE DEPARTMENT TO UNDERSTAND WHAT ALL THOSE BEST PRACTICES OUT THERE AND THEN COMMUNICATE THAT TO. X. HERE'S A PLETHORA OF ABOUT THAT WE'VE SEEN STATE IN MANY. YOU GO. YOU KNOW WHAT CAN LEARN FROM FROM YOUR OTHER CALL AND TO. AND SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE ARE. ON IS THE CAP THE NEW CUT TEN. SECTION BY. PER HIGH QUALITY. FOR OUR DAILY A ANARCHY OFFICE. ALONG WITH THAT WITH THE BEST. THAT WE'VE WITH THAT CAP AREA FOR INSTANCE STAY COOL ENGAGE. WE'VE SEEN THE BEST. ACROSS THE DISTRICTS AROUND. ENGAGE WE WERE. FULL DISTRICT AND SO WILL BE COMMUNICATING. IN MANY DIFFERENT WAYS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU LET ME JUST FOLLOW UP ON THAT YOU KNOW I WAS LOOKING AT SOME OF THE LCF REPORTS AND AS WE WERE LOOKING AT THE TARGETED MONEY FOR THESE GROUPS AND I KNOW MISS WEBBER CARES ABOUT THINK TO START ABOUT THIS BEFORE LOOKING AT THE ACADEMIC GROWTH THE ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENTS AND I READ SOMETHING WHERE AMONG AFRICAN AMERICANS IT'S ACTUALLY. IT'S NOT MEETING THE MARK. AND SO TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW CAN WE- I WILL MAKE SURE THAT THESE INTENDED PURPOSES OR MAYBE IT'S THREE WORKING GROUPS THAT YOU GUYS ARE HAVE NOW IT CD LIKE HARRY TACKLING THIS ISSUE THAT'S GREAT THAT I AM I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT YOU BROUGHT IT AT AT BECAUSE WE'RE ACTUALLY STUDYING THE TWENTY FIVE SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT HAVE THE HIGHEST POPULATION OF AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDENTS. WE'RE LOOKING TO SEE WHAT FUNDING THERE WERE ALREADY RECEIVING AND HOW WE CAN COORDINATE SERVICES TO REALLY TARGET WHAT THEY NEED AND SO WILL BE WORKING WITH THOSE DISTRICTS IN THE COUNTY OFFICES THAT THOSE DISTRICTS ARE WITHIN TO REALLY TARGET AGAIN WE HELP WE HAVEN'T HAD A LOT OF COHERENCE NOW WITH OUR EL CAP IN OUR DASHBOARD AND OUR OUR STATEWIDE SYSTEM A SUPPORT WE HAVE NOW HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY PROVIDE COHERENCE WITH OUR SUPPORT. AND SO WE WILL BE TARGETING THOSE SPECIFIC SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO HELP THEM GET WHAT THEY NEED TO BETTER SERVE THE STUDENTS. AND IS THAT JUST COMING UP BEST PRACTICES I KNOW SCHOOL AS WORK FOR BUT SO IS THE MULTIPLE WAYS WITHIN OUR STATE RIGHT TO SMITH THE IT'S AROUND CONTINUE IMPROVEMENT AND FINDING OUT WHAT ARE THE ROOT CAUSE SHOES THAT ARE CREE THE- YEARS TO. FAST AND SO TO BE PART WITH THEM AND CAR STATION OF HOW CAN WE HELP WHAT IS GOING ON IT IS THEY'RE SYSTEMIC BIAS WITHIN YOUR PRACTICES IS THERE BUT THE BARRIERS THAT HAVE BEEN CREATED BY. I POLICIES THAT YOU CREATED WITH YOUR LOCAL SCHOOL BOARD SO WE WANT TO HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE DISTRICT TO GET OUT THE ROOT CAUSE BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT A BANDAID FIX. ON A LONG TERM FIX IN ORDER THAT WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT CREATED THE ISSUE AND WHY- OAKLEY TARGET SERVICES BETTER SO DOES. GOT AND I THINK IT WOULD WILL PRO NOT YOUR LOOK AT THIS AS WE CAN TALK ABOUT THE L. CFF. BUT THE HOUSE THE CUTS GRAY FUNDS IN THOSE DE WHERE THOSE AREN'T BEING REALIZE. WHETHER THAT BY BEING UTILIZED. WITH ATTITUDE SAID THE STATE ACHIEVE. AND THE STUDENT GROWTH AND WTH THE CUP. WILL BE ABLE TO AVAILABLE TO THAT. AND YOU'LL BE ABLE TO THAT AND THEN WE THE TREND. THAT'S OUTLINE IN THE ODD. TO HELP. SEE THESE THINGS. SO WHAT I'M HEARING. OKAY WE ASK ADDITION QUESTIONS. MISS PLAN SORRY I HAD TO AT AND QUICK MEETING SOMEONE ELSE. REALLY FOR IN OUR LISTENING SOME OF THE WHEN I WAS OF. REALLY APPRECIATE EVERYONE'S COMMENTS CONCERNING- WHAT WE NEED TO DO AND OBVIOUSLY ACCOUNTABILITY IS AT THE TOP NOW OF EVERYBODY'S LIST FINALLY WE HOPE. OUR AND THAT THAT WE WILL DO THE THINGS THAT ARE ESSENTIAL. I WILL AND I THINK WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THE FACT THAT DID SOMEWHAT CONCERNED THAT YOU KNOW- JUST REPORTING WHERE THE MONEY IS AND WHERE IT GOES AND SO FORTH AND SO ON WILL NOT IMPROVE PERFORMANCE AND THAT IS ABSOLUTELY CORRECT. AND SO IN ADDITION TO THAT I THINK AT SOME POINT THE LEGISLATURE HAS TO DECIDE IT REALLY HAVE. BEEN TO EVERY CHALLENGE. ARE AND I THINK IT'S E. O. HAS HAVE THE SAME QUESTION IT THAT THEY ASK THEMSELVES ABOUT IT. YOU KNOW WHEN I LOOK AT THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT WE HAVE SPENT. RECENTLY ON IT ON THIS PARTICULAR PROJECT AND HOW DID NOT GO TO THE PLACES THAT INTENDED TO GO. IT BREAKS MY HEART BECAUSE- FIVE AND SIX YEARS IN THE LIFE OF A CHILD IS A VERY LONG TIME. AND IF YOU MISS FIVE OR SIX YEARS OF. OF SCHOOL. ARE AND GETTING ADEQUATE SUPPORT THAT REALLY IMPACTS YOUR ENTIRE LIFE I MEAN IT'S- I DON'T THINK ANY OF US WOULD DONATE FIVE OR SIX YEARS OF OUR- LIFE. TO PROGRAM THAT'S FAILING OR TO AN ENVIRONMENT THAT IS NOT ADEQUATELY MEETING THEIR NEEDS. SO WE HAVE TO YOU KNOW I WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WE GO IF WAS SERIOUS. AND LOOKING AT MONEY ONE THING THAT WHAT MEN AND. ABLE ABOUT MAKING THAT BUT WE HAVE TO MAKE. A DECISION OF A RELEASED HIS ABOUT EDUCATING THESE KEY. I MEAN IF WE WERE ARE AND I'M NOT SURE PEOPLE ARE BECAUSE I HEAR. RECOMMENDATIONS OF THINGS THAT THAT WE KNOW WORK. AND PEOPLE DON'T HAVE THE COURAGE TO IMPLEMENT THEM. YOU KNOW WHAT I WE KNOW THE SCHOOLS HAVE TOO MANY BRANDON TEACHERS. WE KNOW THAT. TOO MANY AND EXPERIENCED TEACHERS. AND THE SOLUTION IS FAIRLY SIMPLE. YOU HAVE TO MIX UP THE SCHOOLS. AND YOU HAVE THE COURAGE. TO PUT TO PUT PEOPLE WITH A NEEDED IN SCHOOLS AND- AND YOU CAN DO THAT. BY STATE LAW YOU CAN BE THERE. BUT WE DON'T OF THE COURAGE. AND THE SO THAT'S MY MADE BECAUSE- AS WE TALK ABOUT THIS AND GET THIS. HE UNVEILED. AND WE GET THIS DONE RIGHT. AND WE CAN FIGURE OUT WHAT'S GOING ON. THEN THE OTHER QUESTION IS GONNA BE WOULD WE EVER HAVE THE COURAGE TO REALLY EDUCATE THE CHILDREN OF CALIFORNIA. AND WE KEEP CHANGING THE STORY EVERY DAY AND I SEE KIDS WHO SPENDING FIVE SIX SEVEN YEARS OF THAT LONGER IN OUR SCHOOLS AND NOT GETTING THAT MUCH BETTER. AND WE KNOW THE END RESULT IS KIND OF WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN AND OBVIOUSLY THE STORY OF AFRICAN AMERICAN KIDS IN CALIFORNIA IS TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE. TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE IN TERMS OF THE CONTINUED FAILURE AND THE AND THE CHIEF MEANT GAP THAT JUST SEEMS TO BE PERSISTENT AND NEVER CHANGING. AND EVERY YEAR IN CERTAIN SCHOOLS IS ALWAYS SOMETHING NEW COMES UP THAT'S TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE. AND SO I APPRECIATE EVERYBODY COMING I KNOW MY DISTRICT WAS HERE AND THERE WAS COSTLY WORKING ON THESE ISSUES- BUT I KEEP ASKING PEOPLE IF THEY REALLY HAVE THE COURAGE TO A FOR CHILDREN AND TO DO THE RIGHT THING. AND THERE ARE VERY FEW ADVOCATES FOR CHILDREN IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THE LOTS OF ADVOCATES FOR OLD PEOPLE A- AND I DON'T MEAN SENIORS I MEAN US YOU KNOW THOSE WHO CAN DO FOR THEMSELVES WE A LOT OF ADVOCATES BUT I REALLY THANK YOU ALL FOR COMING- PERSONALLY AND- GIVING US THIS INFORMATION AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WITH THE TWO BILLS THAT ARE COMING UP IN THE- ASSISTANCE OF THE GOVERNOR TO. AT LEAST TO GET IT RIGHT IN TERMS WHERE THE MONEY GOES AND HOW WE ACCOUNT WHAT AND SO WITH THIS ONE AND THAT WAY WE WON'T HAVE ANY EXCUSE FOR NOT ADDRESSING THE OTHER ISSUE THAT WE'VE GOT THE RESOURCES NOW WHAT WE GONNA DO. YOU KNOW AND WE MADE A COMMITMENT TO ALL THOSE WHO DON'T GET THAT EXTRA MONEY THAT WE WOULD DO THIS AND I THINK ABOUT THAT REGULARLY BECAUSE WE WENT TO IT I WANT TO COLLEAGUES WHO SCHOOLS WILL NOT GET CONCENTRATION GRANTS AND WOULD NOT GET THAT MONEY. AND THEY WILL GET THE BASS GRANT BUT WE ASSURE THEM THAT THIS WAS SOMETHING THAT THEY WOULD MAKE A SACRIFICE FOR BECAUSE WE WERE GOING TO CLOSE THE GAP AND IMPROVE CAL. AND ALL OF OUR LIVES LEADERS OF THAT CONCEPT AND EVERY TIME I GO TO DISTRIBUTE IS NOT GET RESOURCES IN AFTER TODAY'S I'VE LIKE FAILED HIM OF A WE LIVE. BECAUSE WE DID NOT DO WHAT WE SAID WE WERE GOING TO DO AND THEY US OF NOT RICH A SO MY- WHY SO THAT WE CAN. OUR THE COMMUNITY SAID THAT AND IF AND WE HAVE TO DELIVER THAT. THAT WE MAY. GOING BACK.

CLOSER MONITORING OF DISTRICTS AND COUNTY SPENDING OF SUPPLEMENTAL CONCENTRATION FUNDS AS NECESSARY TO ENSURE THAT THESE FUNDS REACH THEIR INTENDED RECIPIENTS. NAMELY HIGH NEED STUDENTS. THIS IS PRECISELY THE TYPE OF TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY OF THE I'LL SEE IF I HAVE A ENVISIONED BUT IN EXCHANGE FOR GREATER FLEXIBILITY FUNDS. THE DISTRICTS IN COUNTY OFFICES WOULD PROVIDE INCREASED TRANSPARENT AND ACCOUNTABILITY. AND ENGAGEMENT FOR LOCAL STAKEHOLDERS. WE WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THAT THE STATE BOARD OF ED. NEW TAP MADE IMPROVEMENTS WILL ULTIMATELY REJECTED MAKING DISTRICTS ANALYZE EACH YEAR WHETHER THEIR SUPPLEMENTAL IN CONCENTRATION SPENDING AND SUPPORTED ACTIONS ARE EFFECTIVE.
