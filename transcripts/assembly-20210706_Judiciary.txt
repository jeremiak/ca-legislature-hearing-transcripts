SENATOR WIENER FULL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN- I WANT TO THANK YOU AND YOUR STAFF FOR WORKING WITH US AND THANK YOU TO THE COMMITTEE FOR THE VERY THOROUGH ANALYSIS OF THE BILL I COLLEAGUES SB TWO FIFTY TWO WILL BE ON THE UNNECESSARY USE OF DOGS AND CATS IN TOXICITY TESTING. IN CALIFORNIA- THE BILL MAY LOOK FAMILIAR YOU HEARD THIS BILL LAST YEAR- WHEN THEN ASSEMBLY MEMBER CALLED LONGER INTRODUCED TO UNFORTUNATELY HAD TO ABANDON THE BILL AFTER THE CODE ED- BILL REDUCTION PROCESS WHEN IN PLACE- SO WE REINTRODUCE IT THIS YEAR. IN THE SENATE- TOXICITY TESTING AS- DEFINED IN THIS BILL- IT INCLUDES FORCE FEEDING OR INJECTING ANIMALS WITH HARMFUL CHEMICALS. TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTS OF THESE CHEMICALS AND WHAT THEY MIGHT EFFECTIVE MIGHT HAVE ON HUMANS. FOR EXAMPLE PUTTING A DOG IN A CAGE FOR A YEAR. AND FORCE FEEDING OF PESTICIDES EVERY DAY FOR A YEAR JUST TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS. TO IT- IT IS SOME OF THESE TESTS INVOLVE INTENTIONALLY OVERDOSING- THESE ANIMALS- LONG TERM- HORRIFIC PAIN INTENTIONALLY BECAUSE- JUST TO SEE WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN- ANIMALS ARE OBSERVED. TO SEE IF A BOMB AT TO SEE IF THEY BELIEVE. MAY BE PLEASE ENTER VIA DAY AFTER DAY AFTER DAY AFTER DAY. SEE IF IT DEVELOP TUMORS AND SEE IF DIE- THIS IS THESE DOGS AND CATS SUFFER GREATLY FROM THIS TOXICITY TESTING. AND WE NOW KNOW FROM INCREASING EVIDENCE THAT THESE TESTS ARE REALLY NOT THAT HELPFUL. IN TERMS OF PREDICTING IMPACTS. ON THE HUMAN BODY. BUT CONTINUED TO PERFORM THESE TASKS AND CONTINUES TO USE THESE ANIMALS- SOMETIMES IT APPEARS BY FORCE OF HABIT. WE'RE JUST BECAUSE THAT'S THE WAY IT'S ALWAYS BEEN- DRUG DEVELOPMENT RESEARCH IN PARTICULAR BECAUSE I KNOW YOU'VE ALL HEARD FROM- FROM THE DRUG INDUSTRY- SHOWS THAT ANIMAL MODELS ARE POOR PREDICTORS FOR DRUG SAFETY IN HUMANS. AND KEEP IN MIND THIS IS TO ABOUT TOXICITY TESTING ABOUT SAFETY THAT'S A POOR PREDICTOR 90% OF DRUG DRUGS THAT ARE FIRST TESTED ON ANIMALS. ULTIMATELY FAIL WHEN THEY ARE TESTED OR WARRANTY IN HUMANS SUBSEQUENTLY- RESEARCHERS HAVE EVEN EQUATED PREDICTIONS OF TOXICITY- BASED ON CANINE DATA. TO BE ONLY SLIGHTLY BETTER THAN TOSSING A COIN. IN ADDITION- THE TESTING PROCESS LACKS TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY. IT'S OFTEN CONDUCTED BEHIND CLOSED DOORS AND PRIVATE LIVES THAT ARE NOT REQUIRED TO REPORT WHAT TESTS THEY ARE CONDUCTING OR WHY. ARE ONE YOUR PESTICIDE TESTS AS I MENTIONED BEFORE SPEED FOR A YEAR ALL THE DOGS ARE KILLED AT THE END OF THE STUDY IF THEY DO NOT DIE DURING THE STUDY. THE EPA ELIMINATED THIS TEST REQUIREMENT MORE THAN A DECADE AGO IT'S NO LONGER REQUIRED THERE COMPANIES CONTINUE TO CARRY IT OUT. CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN A LEADER IN ALTERNATIVE TESTING METHODS TO REPLACE ANIMAL TESTING WITH NEW INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGY- AND THERE ARE A NUMBER OF EXAMPLES OF THIS- THE WORK OF COMPANIES IN CALIFORNIA DEVELOPING ALTERNATIVES. TO ANIMAL TESTING IS IMPRESSIVE WE SHOULD BE ENCOURAGING THE SHIFT. INSTEAD OF EMPOWERING A VERY INEFFECTIVE. I STATUS QUO. THE BILL RINSE. TO PER CITY TESTING CARRIED OUT ON DOGS AND CATS THAT SERVE O REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS. IF THERE IS A REGULATORY REQUIREMENT. FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OR FROM THE STATE THEN THAT'S EXEMPT FROM THIS BILL WE'RE NOT LOOKING TO OVERRIDE MANDATE SO YOU HAVE TO WE DON'T PUT COMPANIES AND NOT. OPPOSITION AND THE BILL IS MORE LIMITED THAN LAST YEAR'S THE LAST YOUR BILL WENT THROUGH ONE COMMITTEE AND THEN STOPPED WE'VE BEEN THROUGH AN ENTIRE HOUSE WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH STAKEHOLDERS. WE MADE A SERIES OF AMENDMENTS IN RESPONSE TO FEEDBACK THAT WE RECEIVED- FROM- INDUSTRY- AND I THINK IT'S A WELL CRAFTED- BILL- I WANT TO BE CLEAR THIS BILL DOES NOT BAN ALL ANIMAL TESTING IT'S ABOUT TOXICITY TESTING ONE SPECIFIC FORM AND DOGS AND CATS THIS BILL IS NOT GOING TO OFFEND THE BIOTECH INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA THERE'S BEEN AN INSINUATION OF THAT THAT IS COMPLETELY BASELESS I HAVE A LARGE BIOTECH INDUSTRY IN MY DISTRICT IT'S AN INDUSTRY THAT I. ADMIRE GREATLY IN TERMS OF THE LIFESAVING INNOVATION- THIS IS ABOUT WHETHER THEY CAN ACTUALLY DO TOXICITY TESTS ON DOGS AND CATS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- AND THAT'S NOT GOING TO UP AND THE INDUSTRY BY ANY STRETCH OF IMAGINATION THOUGH CONTINUE TO BE ABLE TO INNOVATE HERE TO MANUFACTURE HERE AND TO DO THEIR GREAT WORK HERE I TELL YOU THIS IS A BILL WORTHY OF YOUR SUPPORT AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. WITH ME TODAY TESTIFY ARE KATHLEEN CONLEE THE VICE PRESIDENT OF ANIMAL RESEARCH ISSUES AT THE HUMANE SOCIETY OUR SPONSOR AND OTHER BARBARA HODGES A VETERINARIAN WITH A HUMANE SOCIETY VETERINARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATOR I DO HAVE THOSE TWO WITNESSES LISTED WITH US ON THE TELEPHONE. KATHLEEN CONNELLY ARE YOU WITH US. I AM CAN YOU HEAR ME YES GO AHEAD PLEASE. RIGHT THANK YOU CHARACTER ON AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF SENATE BILL TWO FIFTY TO THE PET ACT MY NAME IS KATHLEEN CONLEY AND I AM VICE PRESIDENT OF ANIMAL RESEARCH ISSUES FOR THE HUMANE SOCIETY OF THE UNITED STATES. I MYSELF WORKED FOR SEVERAL YEARS AT A PRIMATE BREEDING AND RESEARCH LABORATORY BECAUSE I WAS CONCERNED ABOUT HUMAN HEALTH AND WANT TO FIND CURES FOR HUMAN BUT I WAS ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT ANIMAL WELFARE I LEFT THE LAB FOR THE SAME REASON. I WON FIRST DRESS AT THIS BILL DOESN'T STOP ALL ANIMAL TESTING AND RESEARCH IMPACTS LESS THAN 1% OF ALL ANIMALS USED IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND IS NOT A SALES OR MANUFACTURING BANDS ALSO DOGS AND CATS ARE USED FOR CODE RESEARCHER. TESTING RELATED TO HUMANS. NFL TO GET TWO HAS SEVERAL. AS VERY NARROW IN SCOPE SEVERAL. HAVE BEEN MADE TO ADDRESS CONCERNS BUT SOME REQUEST SIMPLY HAVEN'T BEEN FEASIBLE. BUT THERE'S THOSE THAT MAINTAIN THE STATUS QUO OF THE MOST RECENT WHICH WOULD AFFECT THE FEDERAL AGENCY TO BE PROACTIVE. WHEN IT IS MORE REASONABLE FOR THE STATE TO EXPECT COMPANIES TO BE PROACTIVE. PEOPLE ARE SHOCKED WHEN THEY SEE IMAGES OF DOGS SUFFERING IN TOXICITY TESTS AND TELL ME THEY CAN'T BELIEVE IT STILL LEGAL. A POLL RELEASED EARLIER THIS YEAR FOUND THAT TEXAS A TESTING ON DOGS. IN ADDITION TO THEIR SUFFERING THERE'S OVERWHELMING EVIDENCE OF THE FAILURE OF TOXICITY TESTING ON DOGS. INCLUDING N SAMPLES OF FARM CHICKEN. AND THE VALUE OF NON ANIMAL ALTERNATIVES SUCH AS ORGAN ON A CHIP TECHNOLOGIES ORGANIZED SYSTEMS BIOLOGY AND MUCH MORE. INCLUDING INCREDIBLE. WORK HAPPENING RIGHT IN CALIFORNIA. DR GARY FAMILY OF THE SAN FOR CAN. FINE SUBMITTED A SUPPORT LETTER THAT INCLUDED EXTENSIVE INFORMATION ABOUT THE EVIDENCE. OVERALL RESULTS FROM TECH TO THE TEST ON DOGS AND CATS WILL NEVER IMPROVE. WELL THE NON ANIMAL TECHNOLOGIES WILL ONLY CONTINUE TO GAIN GROUND SAVING PRECIOUS TIME IN RESEARCH DOLLARS. ACTIVITY TESTING ON THE COMPLIANCE TESTING ANIMALS AS AN EASY BACK TO CHECK FOR PRODUCT APPROVAL THERE IS NO REAL INCENTIVE TO STOP. BUT YOU ALL CAN HELP WITH THAT IF YOU FELL IN FAVOR OF SENATE BILL TWO FIFTY TWO YOU WILL PROTECT ON THING CANNOT. INCREASE IN A DECADE- ANIMATION AND BE A PART OF BY YOUR CONSTITUENTS. I HOPE YOU. WILL CHOOSE TO DO SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND THEN DOCTOR HOW. YES GOOD MORNING CAN YOU HEAR ME YES WE CAN. GREAT THE MORNING CARE STONE AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE OTHER DOCTOR BARBARA HODGES CALIFORNIA VETERINARIAN PRACTICING SMALL ANIMAL MEDICINE EXCLUSIVELY WITH DOCTOR CAPS PATIENTS FOR THE PAST TWENTY YEARS. I REPRESENTS THE HUMANE SOCIETY VETERINARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION WITH APPROXIMATELY NINE THOUSAND MEMBERS NATIONWIDE INCLUDING TWO THOUSAND MEMBERS IN CALIFORNIA WE STRONGLY SUPPORT SB TWO FIVE TWO WHICH WOULD BAN CRUEL AND UNNECESSARY TOXICITY TESTING ON DOCTOR CAPS IN CALIFORNIA. DURING CHECKING OUT SUCH ARE EXPOSED TO DRAW PETRIFIED OTHER CHEMICALS AND OTHER THAN A BIRD. FOR EFFECTS SUCH AS VOMITING SEIZURES DIFFICULTY BREATHING HEART FAILURE OR EVEN DEATH AFTER THE STUDIES THE ANIMAL SUBJECTS ARE OFTEN KILLED SO THERE TO SHOOT AN ORGAN CAN BE EXAMINED. HOWEVER THERE IS IN FACT A POOR CORRELATION BETWEEN THE RESULTS OBTAINED FROM TESTING ON THESE ANIMALS AND REAL WORLD OUTCOMES IN HUMANS SB TWO FIVE Q. ENCOURAGES HUMAN RELEVANT NON ANIMAL TESTING METHODS WHILE PROVIDING EXEMPTIONS FOR MEDICAL RESEARCH DON'T HAVE MANDATED TO USE ANIMAL. AND TESTING OF MEDICATIONS AND PRODUCTS MEANT. FOR DOGS AND CATS WITHOUT. SB TWO FIVE TWO ENCOURAGE IS THE DEBATE AND OF NON. HEALTH TESTING. THAT WOULD MORE IF INSURE HUMAN AND SAFETY WELL IT'S KNOWLEDGE IN THE STRONG EMPATHIC BOND THAT CALIFORNIANS HAVE WITH COMPANION DOGS AND CATS. CALIFORNIA HAS A LONG AND IMPRESSIVE HISTORY OF ANIMAL WELFARE LEADERSHIP INCLUDING PASSAGE OF THE FIRST STATEWIDE LEGISLATION TO END THE TELECOM MEDICS KEPT IT ON APPLE'S. WE URGE YOU TO SUPPORT YES PIONEERING BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU. RIGHT THERE ANYONE IN THE HEARING ROOM WHO WOULD LIKE TO INDICATE SUPPORT FOR SB TWO FIFTY TWO.

ALL RIGHT WE DO HAVE A CORE SO I HAVE TO WITNESSES. THANK YOU WE DO HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND TWO WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION WHO ARE HERE WITH US IN THE ROOM WHERE A TOP AND JEANS. GRUFFALO COMING UP TO THE MICROPHONE. GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN BURE'S DINNER FEEL ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA LIFE SCIENCES. PLEASE NOTE THAT IN ADDITION TO COS HAD A NET C. N. TA THE BY THE CALIFORNIA BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH ASSOCIATION EMBARK ON CALLER CALIFORNIA WILL HAVE AN OPPOSE UNLESS. AMENDED POSITION ON SB TWO FIVE TWO. THE FIRST DAY WE GREATLY APPRECIATE THE NUMEROUS CONVERSATIONS WE'VE HAD WITH SENATOR WIENER AND HIS STAFF ON HIS BILL. THE CENTER HAS A KEEN KEENE PERSPECTIVE ON OUR INDUSTRY AND WE'RE THANKFUL FOR HIS TIME AND ENGAGEMENT WITH US THANK YOU. THE BASIS FOR OFFERED POSE LESS AMENDED POSITION IS STRAIGHTFORWARD. CURRENTLY BUILT THE BILL REQUIRES OUR MEMBERS TO GET PERMISSION FROM THE FDA TO TEST ON DOGS OR CATS AS PART OF DRUG DEVELOPMENT. THE FDA DOES NOT PROVIDE SUCH WRITTEN PERMISSION NOR IS THERE FEDERAL OUT TOWARD THE CENTER. TO BE CLEAR THE FDA HAS NOT DOES NOT. IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE WILL NOT PROVIDE PERMISSION TO ALLOW FOR SUCH TESTING. WE ABSOLUTELY AGREE WITH A LOT OF GOALS OF SB TWO FIVE TO LIMIT SUCH TESTING. OUR MEMBERS OF STAFF CORPORATE GOALS TOWARD THAT END. AS AN ACT OF LAST RESORT NOT CONVENIENCE OUR MEMBERS TEST ON DOGS OR CATS IN ONLY ONE HALF OF 1% FOR MEDICAL RESEARCH AND TEACHING IN OUR STATE. AND THIS PERCENTAGE CONTINUES TO DECLINE. NONETHELESS THE FTA ANOTHER GLOBAL REGULAR REGULATORS. RECOGNIZE SIGNS SHOULD DRIVE WHICH NON RODENT SPECIES ARE BEST FOR DRUG ACTUALLY THE NUMBER FOR DOGS AND CATS CONTINUE TO DECLINE. OUR MEMBERS ARE ENGAGED IDENTIFYING REAL RESEARCH ALTERNATIVES BUT THE SCIENCE JUST ISN'T THERE YET. ALL CLOSE BY UNDERSCORING RATHER SHARED COMMON GROUND. THE BILL WAS AMENDED TO ALLOW FOR TESTING SPECIFIC TO ANASTASIA CANCER TREATMENT ANIMAL VACCINES AND OTHER ANIMAL MEDICINES. WE APPRECIATE AND SUPPORT SUCH EXEMPTIONS OBVIOUSLY THE AUTHOR AND SPONSORS RECOGNIZE SUCH ANY SIMPLY WE ASK THAT THIS RECOGNITION IS APPLIED BROADLY IN ORDER TO AVOID HAVING TO PICK WHICH DISEASE FALLS INTO THE CATEGORY OF BAD ENOUGH. HAS WRITTEN SB TWO FIVE TWO WILL HINDER OUR ABILITY TO PROVIDE THE NEXT POTENTIAL DRUG TO COME TO MARKET THAT IN THE VERY LEAST WOULD PROVIDE RELIEF BUT HOPEFULLY EVEN BETTER SAVE LIVES THANK YOU AND AVAIL AND AVAILABLE TELEPHONICALLY CHANCE FOR MORE TECHNICAL QUESTIONS AS MARK COLEMAN CEO OF EXPANDED FEDEX. THANK YOU. THANK YOU IN THE NEXT WE HAVE MORE A TOP. I THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS TIME WHERE A TOP ARE HERE ON BEHALF OF BIO CALM CALIFORNIA AND WE TOO ARE HERE REGRETTABLY IN A POSITION OF OPPOSING LAST AMENDED. AND JUSTIN MENTIONED- PHARMACOLOGICAL TESTING ON CATS AND DOGS IS NOT SOMETHING OUR COMPANIES DO CAPRICIOUSLY OR OUT OF CONVENIENCE. IN FACT QUITE THE OPPOSITE. HOWEVER THERE IS A MISCONCEPTION THAT THERE ARE MULTITUDES OF NON ANIMAL BASED TASKS THAT CAN BE SUBSTITUTED IN ALL CASES. THIS IS SIMPLY NOT THE CASE. THE FDA EXPECTS ANIMAL MODELS SINCE. MANY TIMES NOTHING CAN REPLACE THE WHOLE LIVING SYSTEM WHEN DEVELOPING DRUGS ENGAGING DRUG EFFICACY AND SAFETY. OUR COMPANIES USE CATS AND DOGS SPARINGLY AND ONLY WHEN ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY. 95% OF ESSENTIAL ANIMAL WORK IS CONDUCTED ON RODENTS AND ONLY ONE HALF OF 1% OF SUCH WORKS WORK TAKES PLACE ON CATS AND DOGS. BUT WHEN SCIENCE DICTATES THE NEED FOR USE OF NON RODENT SPECIES ARE COMPANIES ARE BOUND TO FOLLOW THOSE SCIENTIFIC PRINCIPLES. WE TWO ARE MOST APPRECIATIVE OF THE TIME THE AUTHOR HAS SPENT IN DISCUSSIONS WITH US ON THE BILL. RECENT AMENDMENTS ARE A GOOD START. WELL THEY PURPORT TO EXEMPT MEDICAL RESEARCH THE LANGUAGE REQUIRES A WRITTEN MANDATE FROM THE FTA. THAT IS NOT HOW THE FDA OPERATES. THE FDA. ONLY ONCE THE COMPLETED STUDIES ARE PRESENTED TO THEM. THIS BILL THE BILL- RECOGNIZES THIS INCONSISTENCY BECAUSE IT PROVIDES A FULL EXEMPTION FOR VACCINE DEVELOPMENT. WELL WE CERTAINLY AGREE THAT VACCINE DEVELOPMENT IS CRITICAL ESPECIALLY THIS YEAR WE MUST ENSURE THAT THERAPIES FOR CANCER AND ALZHEIMER'S FOR NON OPIOID PAIN RELIEF OPTIONS AND FOR ALL OTHER CRITICAL HUMAN HEALTH CONDITIONS RECEIVE THAT SAME EXCLUSION. THE AMENDMENT WE SEE COULD NOT PROVIDE A LOOPHOLE FOR INAPPROPRIATE ANIMAL TESTING. BUT IS INSTEAD A RESPONSIBLE AND SCIENCE BASED SOLUTIONS. AND LASTLY I WOULD KNOW THE CALIFORNIA ENJOY SOME OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT PROTECTIONS IN THE NATION FOR ANIMALS USED IN SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH. OUR COMPANIES ARE PROUD OF THE FACT THAT THE MAJORITY OF AVAILABLE DOGS ARE ADOPTED TO FOREVER HOMES IN CALIFORNIA WHEN RESEARCHERS CONCLUDED. ANIMAL PROTECTION AND SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH IN CALIFORNIA ARE NOT MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE. WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING OUR DISCUSSIONS WITH THE OFFER TO FIND AMENDMENTS THAT CONTINUE TO UP HOLD CALIFORNIA STRONG ROLE AS THE WORLD'S LIFESCIENCES LEADER HOWEVER WITH THE BILL AS IT'S PRESENTED TODAY WE MUST RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR NO VOTE. OKAY I UNDERSTAND WE ALSO HAVE A MARK COLEMAN ON- AS STAND BY FOR TECHNICAL QUESTIONS- IS THERE ANY OTHER OPPOSITION. IN THE ROOM TODAY AND AGAIN IT WOULD JUST BE. NAME TITLE IN OPPOSITION. OKAY SEE NUMBER GO TO THE PHONES DO WE HAVE ANY. ANYONE CALLING IN OPERATOR- IN OPPOSITION TO SB FIVE TWO FIVE TWO. IN OPPOSITION OF S. B. TWO FIFTY TWO YOU MAY PRESS ONE AND THEN ZERO. AND THAT'S ONE AND THEN ZERO IF YOU'RE IN OPPOSITION OF S. B. TWO FIFTY TWO. AND MISTER CHAIR NO ONE HAS QUEUED UP THERE IS NO OPPOSITION IN Q. AND DO WE HAVE ANYONE IN THE CONFERENCE IN ROOM. SEEN NONE OKAY WE- BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE- ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. NUMBER GONZALEZ. I APPLAUD WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO I AM CONCERNED THOUGH WITH THE ISSUES THAT ARE BROUGHT UP- BY THE COMPANIES AND THE FDA APPROACH TO HOW APPROVAL WOULD BE GRANTED- WHAT WHAT ARE YOU. TRANSYLVANIA I GUESS IN THIS THANK YOU KNOW AND WE'RE SENSE OF THE DATA THE BILL THAT THIS COMMITTEE PASSED LAST YEAR IN THAT WE STARTED OUT WITH. SAID FTA HAS TO REQUIRE IT- BASED ON WHAT WE EARLY ON HEARD FROM THE INDUSTRY WE CHANGE THAT TO RECOMMENDS TO MAKE IT LESS- IRON CLAD BECAUSE WE HEARD WHAT THEY WERE SAYING- THERE AND NOW THEY'RE SAYING THAT THEY NEVER HEAR ANYTHING FROM THE FTA AND IT'S LIKE A MYSTICAL. BLACK BOX AND THEY HAVE TO SORT OF THE DIVINER INTO IT I THINK THE ANALYSIS ACTUALLY DID THE BEST JOB THAT I'VE SEEN WITH A VERY LENGTHY EXPLANATION ABOUT- WHAT HOW THE FDA HAS ACTUALLY BEEN. ENCOURAGING COMPANIES- DRUG COMPANIES TO ENGAGE WITH THE AGENCY MUCH EARLIER ON THESE KINDS OF ISSUES SO WHAT THE VERY THOROUGH DESCRIPTION AND ANALYSIS IS PRETTY INCONSISTENT WITH WHAT THE INDUSTRY TO SIGN. ON WITH THAT THEY THEY PROPOSED IN THEIR LETTER AN AMENDMENT THAT WOULD HAVE OBLITERATED. I MEAN WHAT IF YOU COULD DRIVE A MACK TRUCK THROUGH A LOOPHOLE THEY HAVE NOW I SPOKE DIRECTLY WITH THEM YESTERDAY THEY'RE GONNA COME BACK WITH SOME ADDITIONAL IDEAS I WOULD LOVE TO WORK IT OUT WITH THEM- HI I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY CAN OPERATIONALIZE. WHAT WE'RE REQUIRING I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT THIS DOESN'T BECOME SORT OF A DEAD LETTER- AND SO WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE TO WORK- WITH WITH THE INDUSTRY TO I CAN'T GUARANTEE WE'RE GONNA WORK IT UP A REALLY GOING TO. I TRY TO ACCOMPLISH WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH THAT THERE'S SOME SORT OF INDICATION THAT THE F. THAT THIS IS NEEDED OR RECOMMENDED- AND SOMETHING THAT THEY CAN OPERATIONALIZE THANK YOU I'M- AND I SHOULD KNOW THIS DOES THIS GO TO PREPARATION. IT SHOULD BE OUT I AM I APPRECIATE THAT I'M NOT VOTE FOR TODAY BUT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE SOME PROGRESS MADE TO FEEL THAT YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY- THIS YEAR SHOWS US MORE THAN ANY HOW IMPORTANT OF THE INDUSTRY IS TO AND. ENSURING THAT GOD KNOWS WHAT CAN COME NEXT- WOULD JUST WANNA MAKE IT WORKABLE. ABSOLUTELY WE I COMMITTEE IT WILL WE WILL DO THAT I DO JUST WANT ALSO REITERATE- DIED THIS AND THE IN THIS WHEN I SPOKE WITH HIM JUST. ACKNOWLEDGED THE- BECAUSE AS I MENTIONED EARLIER THERE THERE WAS AN INSINUATION I THINK THAT THIS IS SOMEHOW GOING TO UPEND THE INDUSTRY THIS IS JUST. ABOUT TOXICITY TESTING CALIFORNIA IT'S NOT GONNA UP IN THE INDUSTRY BUT THANK YOU AND YOU HAVE MY COMMITMENT ON THAT. THANK YOU. NUMBER DAVIS THANK YOU. SENATOR A QUESTION FOR YOU WHAT TO WHAT EXTENT WITH THIS BILL FINANCIALLY IMPACT CALIFORNIA BUSINESSES. NOBILITY TO MANUFACTURE AND SELL DRUGS AND OTHER PRODUCTS IN THE STATE. I THINK NOT AT ALL- THIS BILL HAS NO IMPACT ON. MANUFACTURING DEVELOPMENT IT'S SIMPLY ABOUT THIS VERY DISCREET AREA. OF TOXICITY TESTING- THERE YOU KNOW I KNOW THAT THERE ARE OTHER MEANS OF DOING TOXICITY TESTING. OBVIOUSLY WE CAN'T DICTATE WHAT HAPPENS IN THE OTHER FORTY NINE. STATES OR OTHER COUNTRIES IN TERMS OF TOXICITY TESTING. SO IT'S NOT LIKE WE'RE NOT THERE GLOBAL- BANDAN THIS IS A VERY. LIMITED PART OF THE PROCESS I DON'T THINK IT'S GONNA. REALLY IMPACTS. JOBS OF THE INDUSTRY. AT ALL OTHER THAN THAT VERY VERY LIMITED AREA. I THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD AND IF YOU HAVE THEM IN THE FUTURE ANY OTHER RELATED ANIMAL BILLS- WOULD LOVE TO WORK WITH YOU GOOD LUCK TO FIND THE OTHER ANIMAL. ANIMAL PEOPLE IN THE LEGISLATURE EFFECT THANK YOU SOME REMEMBER CRESCENTA. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS FROM MEMBERS. OKAY THE SENATOR A I TO SHARE SOME OF THE CONCERNS AND THAT I HOPE YOU WILL WORK WITH INDUSTRY ON MAKING SURE THAT THIS ISN'T GOING TO BE AN IMPEDIMENT BUT I THINK WE'RE ALL AGREEABLE ON ON ON THE HEART OF THIS POLICY- WHICH IS YOU KNOW ENDING THIS. RICK STREAM WE LIMIT IN THIS- TOXICOLOGY TESTING ON YOUR PETS YOU KNOW OR OR OR OR CATS AND DOG SO- I WILL BE SUPPORTED TODAY AS WELL AND I'LL- GO AHEAD AND- MADAM CLERK PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. MYSTICALLY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL SAY. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A NUMBER OF. THE MOTION IS THE PAST TWO APPROPRIATIONS STONE. GALLAGHER HI GALLAGHER I CHAO CHAO HI CHIU. DAVIES DAVIES I GONZALEZ AS ALWAYS I HOLDEN. HOLDEN I KALRA KILEY MAIENSCHEIN MAIENSCHEIN I YES FIVE REYES AYE. OKAY THE BILL IS OUT- THANK YOU SENATOR PRESHEAF THE PRESENTATIONS MORE THANK YOU VERY MUCH BECAUSE CRESCENTA. NEXT WE HAVE MISTER WILL CUT SENATOR WHAT KASKY PLEASE. YOU HAVE SB FIVE THIRTY ONE. GOOD MORNING ARE MISTER VICE CHAIR OF NUMBERS I'M AT ITS CORE FIVE THREE ONE IS ABOUT BASIC RECORD KEEPING AND TRANSPARENCY PROTECTION FOR CONSUMERS AT THAT HAVE DEBT IS THAT STUFF ANALYSIS POINTS OUT IN TWENTY THIRTEEN WE PASSED THE FAIR DEBT BUYING PRACTICES ACT WHICH BROUGHT MUCH NEEDED REFORM TO A LARGELY UNREGULATED BROKEN SYSTEM OF DEBT BUYING HERE IN CALIFORNIA. THERE WERE WIDESPREAD COMPLAINTS AT THE TIME OF COLLECTIONS GOING ON AGAINST THE WRONG PERSON OR TARGETING DEBT THAT WAS ALREADY PAID OFF FOR PAPER EFFORTS TO CORRECT. WRONG AMOUNT OF DEBT SO THE THAT ACT HELP ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES BY REQUIRING TECH BUYERS WHO HAVE DEBT SOLD TO THEM OPERATIVE VERB IS SOLD AT TO HAVE PROOF THAT THEIR OF THEIR OWNERSHIP THAT ALLOW THE CONSUMER TO- REQUEST THAT PROOF ALSO THE LOG REQUIRED DISCLOSURE WITH THE BASIC INFORMATION ABOUT THE DEBT HOW MUCH WAS OWED WHAT WERE THE FEES AND INTEREST. AND THE DATE OF THE LAST PAYMENT UNFORTUNATELY WE'VE RECEIVED REPORTS FROM A LEGAL SERVICE OF DEBT COLLECTORS WHO ARE GOING OUT OF THEIR WAY TO ASSERT- THE ACT BY COLLECTING ON DEBT THAT IS A SIGN NOT SOLD BECAUSE THE DEBT IS NOT SOLD ALL THE CONSUMER RIGHTS AND ALL PROTECTIONS THAT ARE GIVEN THEM UNDER THE FAIR DEBT BUYING. PRACTICES ACT ARE BEING CIRCUMVENT. DEBT COLLECTORS SERVE ONCE AGAIN THE SAME- OLD THERE TARA THE WRONG DEBTORS COLLECT A INCORRECT AMOUNTS AND THE CONSUMERS NO WAY TURN THE TRUTH OF THE- SO THE HIGHLIGHT THAT INTO SIXTEEN SO THE BUREAU OF CAN FINANCIAL. FOUND THAT THE NUMBER ONE CAN ON AGAIN FINANCIAL IS IN CAL WAS PEOPLE COLLECTING ON THE WRONG THE RIGHT FROM THE WRONG PERSON THERE WERE THREE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED COMPLAINTS AND THAT ONLY INCLUDED DE- REPORTED COMPLAINTS TO THE BILL. WOULD REQUIRED COLLECTOR WHO HAVE YOU'RE DEALING DEBT SIGN TO THEM TO HAVE PROOF THAT THEY HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO COLLECT ON THE DEBT. THE BILL WOULD GET CONSUMERS THE RIGHT TO REQUEST PROOF ALONG WITH SOME OTHER BASIC INFORMATION. REGARDING THE DEBT AND WITH ME THOSE ARE THE SAME RIGHT TO BUY THE WAITER WITH THE FAIR DEBT BUYING- PRACTICES ACT. LATE LEAVE FERRON WITH THE PUBLIC LAWCENTER HI INSTEAD IS HERE TO TESTIFY I AM TAKING THE AMENDMENTS THAT ARTICULATED THE STAFF REPORT THAT WERE.

GOOD MORNING- MY NAME IS LI PARENTS I'M THE DIRECTOR. OF LITIGATION AND PRO BONO AT THE PUMP. I'M GOING TO REPEAT COLLECTION LETTERS FROM OUR HAVE BEEN THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN SUED BY DEBT COLLECTORS. IN SOME INSTANCES THE DEBT COLLECTORS HAVE BEEN ASSIGNED THE DEATH THIS IS COMMON WITH HOSPITAL AND MEDICAL THAT- WHERE THE PROVIDER COULD NOT SELL THE DATA BUT I CAN'T FIND THE RIGHT TO COLLECT TO A THIRD PARTY DEBT COLLECTOR. WILL NEED THAT VERIFYING THE PROTECTION AND THE REQUIREMENTS AS AN AS THE SENATOR MENTIONED IN THE FAIR DEBT BUYING PRACTICES ACT DO NOT APPLY. TO A DEBT COLLECTOR THAT DEFINED IT THAT DOESN'T HAVE TO PROVIDE THE SAME BASIC INFORMATION. NOTED THAT BY HER DAD. ONE OF THE FIRST QUESTION WE ASK OF OUR- AS WELL OR NOT THE CLIENT IN MILLION THE TACKLE. MOST IF NOT ALL THE TIME OUR CLIENTS THEY KNOW THEY'VE NEVER HEARD OF THEM. DEPENDING ON THE INFORMATION PROVIDED IN THE COLLECTION LETTER OR IN THE LAWSUIT. AFTER SENATE INVESTIGATION FOR DISCOVERY- TLT STAFF AND ATTORNEYS CAN USUALLY FIGURE IT OUT- WE CAN DETERMINE WHO THE ORIGINAL CREDITOR IS AND IDENTIFY THE ACCOUNT OPEN THAT COLLECTOR IS COLLECTING. HOW SO MANY DEBTORS ARE UNHAPPY. IN CALIFORNIA COURT AND MANY CALIFORNIANS ARE STUCK NAVIGATING THE COMPLEX NETWORK OF DEBT COLLECTORS AND IF I NEEDS ON THEIR OWN. AND MAY NEVER BE ABLE TO GET THE INFORMATION THEY NEED FROM THE DEBT COLLECTOR TO VERIFY THAT THAT. WE THE DEBTORS WONDER THE DECAL. COLLECTING AND THAT THE BIG. I HOPE. SB FIVE THIRTY ONE WOULD LOOK THAT YOU. I THAT ARE AT. THAT WOULD HAVE TO PROVIDE INFORMATION. SUCH AS THE NATURE OF THE UNDERLYING THAT THE DATA DEFAULT AND THE DATE OF THE LAST PAYMENT. THE NAME AND ADDRESS OF THE ORIGINAL CREDITOR. BASIC INFORMATION WILL GET BETTER WHAT THEY NEED TO EVALUATE THAT THAT IT REALLY THERE'S JUST A DOLLAR AMOUNT BEING CORRECT. AND HOPEFULLY ALLOW THEM TO RESOLVE THEIR DEBT EARLIER ON WITH CONFIDENCE THAT THAT THAT REALLY IS SOMETHING THEY ARE. AT THE FIVE THIRTY ONE WILL ALSO PROVIDE A DEFAULT JUDGMENT FROM BEING ENTERED IF THIS INFORMATION IS NOT INCLUDED IN THE LAWSUIT. CALIFORNIA BETTER SHOULD NOT END UP WITH A DEFAULT JUDGMENT FOR A DEBT COLLECTOR THAT CAN. EVEN TELL THEM THAT THE ORIGINAL CREDITOR THAT. I DO SUPPORT SB FIVE THIRTY ONE IN THE BETTER AND LYFT.

MY BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT IS DIFFERENT IN THE SENATE AND THE ASSEMBLY AS WE DON'T HAVE A PORTFOLIO TO MY STAFF IS CONTINUE TO FIND DIFFERENT WAYS TO GIVE ME MY MATERIAL IN THIS WAS A PDF THAT WE TRIED IN THE NUMBERS DIDN'T WORK ANYWAY HI GOOD MORNING SB THREE TWENTY SIX TO BETTER PROTECT SURVIVORS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE WELL AS YOU KNOW CURRENTLY IF SOMEONE IS A CONVICTED OR THERE'S A RESTRAINING ORDER DUE TO DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SOMEBODY MUST RELINQUISH THEIR GUNS- BUT THERE IS NO PROCESS FOR THAT TO OCCUR. SO THIS CREATES A TIP- DID TO FIX SENATE RULE FIVE POINT FOUR NINE FOR WHICH CREATED YOU JUST OVERSIGHT PROCESS TO ACTUALLY INSURE THE FIRE ARMS ARE REMOVED- THIS BILL WOULD ALSO REQUIRE THE COURT COMMUNICATE WITH LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ABOUT FAILURES TO RELINQUISH THESE WEAPONS WE KNOW IN MY WITH MY COMMUNITY RECENTLY A POLICE OFFICER WAS SHOT AND KILLED RESPONDING TO A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE WHERE GUNS WERE ON SITE- WE KNOW THAT THE PRESENCE OF A FIREARM INTO. HOME INCREASES THE RISK OF HOMICIDE BY 5100% AND WE KNOW THAT WOMEN AND SPECIALLY WOMEN OF COLOR ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED BY FIRE ARM RELATED DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. EVEN WITH THE STATE. LAWS WE STILL KNOW THAT THERE ARE OVER TWENTY THOUSAND PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA WHO SHOULD NOT HAVE A WEAPON WHO HAVE A WEAPON. AND THAT ARE THOSE THAT ARE ONLY. REGISTERED WITH THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SO THIS WILL SAY THAT BUT THAT THAT THEN THERE'S A PROCESS TO ACTUALLY RETURN THE WEAPONS TO LET LAW ENFORCEMENT KNOW IF THE WEAPONS ARE NOT.

THANK YOU AND GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME'S CATHY SCHLUMBERGER AND A MEMBER OF THE LITTLE HOOVER COMMISSION. HERE TODAY IN SUPPORT OF ATHLETES THREE TWENTY I THINK YOU ALL KNOW- AFSHIN EXISTS TO MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS TO IMPROVE THE EFFICIENCY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF STATE GOVERNMENT. AND LAST YEAR WE STUDIED CALIFORNIA'S RESPONSE IS INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE AS YOU ALL KNOW THIS AFFECTS ALL CALIFORNIANS OF ALL BACKGROUNDS AGES AND GENDER IDENTITY. AND OFTENTIMES IT ENDS UP WITH DEADLY CONSEQUENCES. ONE OF OUR STUDY FOUND THAT 20% OF THE VICTIMS WERE MURDERED WITHIN TWO DAYS OF THE ORDER BEING ISSUED A THIRD WERE KILLED WITHIN A MONTH. AND SO THAT LED US TO THE STATE IT'S JUST IMPERATIVE THAT CALIFORNIA REMOVED FIREARMS FROM. ECCLES PROFIT. AND THAT'S WHERE WE GET THREE TWENTY COUNT CURRENTLY DOES REQUIRE IN THE FUTURE THE PICTURE REQUIRED. ORDER TO RELINQUISH THEIR FIREARMS YES IN OUR REPORT WE FOUND THAT THIS JUST WASN'T HAPPENING ALL THE TIME FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS. SO TO HELP PROTECT VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE THE COMMISSION URGED CALIFORNIA TO BETTER ENFORCE FIREARMS LAWS AND ENSURE THAT THESE WEAPONS. ARE REMOVED IMMEDIATELY FROM DOLLARS PROHIBITED FROM OWNING THEM. AND THAT'S THE TWENTY WOULD CARRY OUT THAT RECOMMENDATION I ENSURING THAT THOSE SUBJECT TO A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE PROTECTIVE ORDER YOU RELINQUISH THEIR FIREARMS. SO IN BEHALF OF THE LITTLE HOOVER COMMISSION I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR IPHONE AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU AND- WE WILL I DO WE DON'T HAVE OFFICIAL OPPOSITION TESTIMONY BUT IS THERE ANYONE ON THE PHONE. WAS ANYONE IN THE ROOM TESTIFYING IN OPPOSITION TO SB. THREE TWENTY.

THANK YOU FOR IN OPPOSITION OF SB THREE TWENTY YOU MAY PRESS ONE AND THEN ZERO. AGAIN THAT'S ONE AND THEN ZERO IF YOU'RE IN OPPOSITION OF SB. THREE TWENTY. MR WE HAVE NO OPPOSITION IN QUEUE AT THIS TIME. OKAY GET BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ANY QUESTIONS COMMENTS FROM MEMBERS. MEMBER GONZALEZ I JUST HAVE A QUESTION I SUPPOSE IF THEY WERE SERIOUS ABOUT IT MAYBE THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN HERE BUT- SEATO POINTS OUT THAT SOMETIMES THIS IS HELD IN CONJUNCTION WITH. OTHER PROCEEDINGS AND IF IT WAS A FELONY PRECEDING. THAT OBVIOUSLY I THINK SHIPS MY OPINION ON REMOTE ACCESS TO A CERTAIN EXTENT BECAUSE WE DO NEED THE RECORD BUT DO YOU KNOW HOW OFTEN THAT'S PAIRED TOGETHER OR IF THERE'S AN THAT WOULD CREATE AN EXEMPTION TO ALLOWING- REMOTE ACCESS. WE DON'T BELIEVE SO I AND I THINK A ISSUE IS THERE SOME ISSUE WITH THE COURT REPORTERS AND SO ANYBODY WHO'S DOING ANYTHING REMOTE NOW THEY'RE THEY'RE COMING TO VOICE WHICH WE UNDERSTAND WE DON'T WANT TO LOSE ANYTHING BUT WE ASO KNOW IN THIS DAY AND AGE THAT WE NEED TO USE REMOTE WHENEVER WE CAN. AS EVIDENCED BY OUR WITNESSES TODAY SO YEAH I AM CONCERNED- WITH THE SANCTITY OF THE RECORD IN CERTAIN CASES AND SO WILL I ABSOLUTELY SUPPORT OF WE'RE GOING TO SUPPORT THIS I JUST WAS WONDERING UNDER YEAH. IF THEY COULD EXPLAIN TO ME OR I GUESS YOU COULD EXPLAIN TO ME WHEN THAT MIGHT BE A SITUATION- BY WHICH WE WOULD. MANDATE AT A VERBATIM RECORD AND SO IT WOULDN'T MATTER OKAY I WOULD I. WOULD ASK MY- MY ATTORNEY ON THE LINE. ALL RIGHT IS JULIE WEBER- IF THAT IF. THE SENDER YOU ASKING FOR MY INPUT YES. R. YES SO IN THIS BILL THE COVERED STIVELL RESTRAINING ORDER MATTER NOT A CRIMINAL MATTERS AT ALL AND- THE CURRENT WILL COURT ALLOWS FOR TELEPHONIC HEARINGS AS WELL SO IT HAS BEEN THE PRACTICE FOR INSTANCE TWENTY FOURTEEN OR SO. THAT HE'S TYPE OF HEARING ASK YOU DID WAS THE JUDGE'S DISCRETION CAN INCLUDE THE OPTION OF A TELEPHONIC APPEARANCE WHICH IS HELPFUL. ESPECIALLY WHERE SAFETY IS OF CONCERN FOR FOLKS APPEARING IN COURT SO THERE ARE WAYS DURING THE PANDEMIC COURTS HAVE BEEN HOLDING REMOTE HEARINGS THERE ARE WAYS TO ENSURE THAT SOME TYPE OF RECORD. FINDING STATEMENT OF DECISIONS AND SO FORTH ARE DOCUMENTED- BUT IT WOULD BE A VERY STRANGE TO REMOVE THE SAID DISCRETION FOR REMOTE APPEARANCES IN THE CIVIL MATTERS WHEN THAT HAS BEEN IN PLACE. PRIOR TO THE INTRODUCTION OF THE STILL. I THINK MICHAEL WAS A LITTLE MORE PEOPLE. I THIS. BY WHICH- I AND I DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS TRUE I'M JUST TAKING THAT LETTER. IS THIS PAIRED EVER WITH- A FELONY MATTER. WHAT A HEARING LIKE NO THESE WOULD BE ENTIRELY STEP I'M SORRY YEAH THEY BE TWO ENTIRELY SEPARATE MATTERS CRIMINAL AND CIVIL PROCEEDINGS THEY MIGHT BE RELATED IN THE SENSE THAT THE SAME INCIDENT RESULTS IN A FELONY CHARGE. AND THE VICTIMS DECIDE TO GET A RESTRAINING ORDER BUT THOSE PROCEDURES WOULD BE HANDLED BY TWO SEPARATE JUDGES WE DON'T HAVE JUDGES WHO HEAR BOTH THE CRIMINAL AND CIVIL MATTERS OF STATE- AND SO THE FELONY PROCEEDING WITH- OCCUR ACCORDING TO CRIMINAL PROCEDURAL. LAWS RULES REGULATIONS AND THE CIVIL MATTER WOULD BE HANDLED SEPARATELY THANK YOU I WAS JUST I WANTED TO CLARIFY THAT BECAUSE IT'S SAID THAT THIS COULD BE HELD IN CONJUNCTION WITH IN THE LETTER AND I JUST WANT TO. BE CLEAR ON MY POSITION ON- THESE ARE NOT HEARINGS BUT- I THINK IT'S BEEN. THINKING. THANK YOU OTHER QUESTIONS. COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. RIGHT SEEING NONE SENATOR YOU MAY CLOSE RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AB I THANK YOU DO WE- DO WE HAVE A MOTION AND SECOND ON THIS ALREADY. DO YOU IT WAS. NUMBER REYES AND SECOND BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER GONZALEZ OKAY. THANK YOU YEAH THIS IS SB THREE TWENTY TO PASS AS AMENDED. TO APPROPRIATIONS WE DO HAVE A MOTION AND SECOND CALL THE ROLL PLEASE. STONE HI STONE HI GALLAGHER- GALLAGHER I SHALL. CHIU DAVIES. GONZALEZ GONZALEZ I HOLDEN. KALRA KALRA AYE KILEY MAIENSCHEIN I MAIENSCHEIN II RES RES I. THE BILL IS OUT THANK YOU. RIGHT SENATOR ADAM NINE SB THREE EIGHTY THANK YOU VERY MUCH THIS IS ALSO A BILL THAT YOU MIGHT RECALL THAT I'VE WORKED ON SOME BEFORE- I'M TODAY I'M PRESENTING SP EIGHTY WHICH MAKES REVISIONS TO THE END OF LIFE OPTIONS ACT THAT I INITIALLY AUTHORED IN TWENTY FIFTEEN AND WANTED TO AFFECT IN TWENTY SIXTEEN. SINCE THE BILL ORIGINALLY PASSED IN AS I COMMITTED AT THE TIME OF ITS PASSAGE I HAVE HELD A MULTIPLE OVERSIGHT HEARINGS AND WE HAVE REVIEWED THE DATA COLLECTED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH EVERY YEAR- WE UNDERSTAND THAT WHEN THE BILL WAS FIRST PASSED WE PUT IN A LOT OF SAFEGUARDS IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE. THAT THE BILL WAS NOT ABUSED IT WAS A LOT OF FEAR THAT- PEOPLE WOULD BE TAKING IT HAPHAZARDLY OR THAT OLDER PEOPLE WOULD BE THE FIRST TO USE IT OR THAT THAT WE WOULD WE WOULD THAT GET RID OF PEOPLE OF COLOR AND POOR PEOPLE- AND WE HAVE FOUND THAT NOT TO BE TRUE- THE DATA HAS BEEN CONSISTENT OVER THE FIVE YEARS THAT WE'VE COLLECTED IT WHICH HAS BEEN CONSISTENT WITH WHAT'S BEEN WHAT HAS BEEN COLLECTED AROUND THE COUNTRY. THERE HAS NOT BEEN ONE EVIDENCE OF COLLUSION FOR- OR ANY KIND OF PROBLEMS BUT WHAT WE HAVE FOUND IS THAT WHILE THE SAFEGUARDS ARE PUT IN PLACE TO MAKE SURE HAT EVERYTHING WENT AS PLANNED- THE SAFEGUARDS HAVE NOW BECOME BARRIERS TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS THE BILL. AND I KNOW THAT'S WHAT NOT NOBODY NOBODY WANTS THAT- ONCE A FROM KAISER SHOW THAT ABOUT ONE THIRD OF TERMINALLY ILL ADULTS WHO REQUEST TO USE THE ACT ACTUALLY DIE BEFORE THEY ARE ABLE TO USE IT- OFTENTIMES DYING IN THE VERY WAY THAT THEY MOST FEARED THAT THEY WOULD DIE- IN TWENTY NINETEEN. OREGON AUTHORIZED A WAIVER OF THE FIFTEEN DAY WAITING PERIOD BETWEEN REQUESTS AND NEW MEXICO RECENTLY PASSED IT WITH A FORTY EIGHT HOUR WAITING PERIOD SO AS YOU RECALL WHEN SOMEONE HAS A TERMINAL ILLNESS FROM WHICH NO CURE IT'S EXPECTED WHICH MEETS THE HOSPICE CRITERIA AND ALMOST 90% OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE USED THIS OUR HOSPICE PATIENTS AND ARE IN HOSPICE. OFTENTIMES HAVING FOUGHTTHEIR DISEASE FOR YEARS. AND NOW AT THE END OF THEIR LIFE- WE PUT IN FOR. DAYS THAT INITIAL. AND THEN A FOLLOW UP IN WRITING. WITH WITNESSES AND THEN A SECOND REQUEST FIFTEEN DAYS LATER. AND THEN THERE WAS A FOURTH AND FINAL ATTESTATION AT THE VERY END. SO WHAT WE ARE ASKING NOW IS THAT WE WOULD PREDICT TAKE THAT FIFTEEN DAYS TO A TWO DAY A FORTY EIGHT HOUR WAITING PERIOD. WE HAVE WORK WITH THE CALIFORNIA. MEDICAL ASSOCIATION THE CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION. EVERYBODY IS OKAY WITH THIS- WE'VE ALSO COME TO REALIZE THAT THAT FINAL AND FOURTH ATTESTATION FEELS REDUNDANT AND SOMETIMES INSULTING TO PEOPLE IF THEY HAVE TO FILL IT OUT WITHIN FORTY EIGHT HOURS AT THE TIME. THAT THE INGEST THE MEDICATION THAT YES THEY KNOW AND YES THEY ARE NOT BE COATED PERSON YES THEY ARE STILL SURE. US WERE ASKING TO GET RID OF THAT. AND WE'RE ALSO ASKING TO GET RID OF THE SUNSET THIS IS MY FINAL TERM- THERE HAS BEEN NO EVIDENCE OF ABUSE OF THIS BILL- AND TO BE ABLE TO HAVE SOMETHING IN PLACE. FOR PEOPLE AND THEN TAKE IT AWAY FROM THEM- DOESN'T SEEM DOESN'T SEEM RIGHT AND SO WE'RE ASKING TO GET RID OF THE SUNSET. THE DATA WILL STILL BE COLLECTED EVERY SINGLE YEAR THE DEPARTMENT OF. CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH WILL STILL MAINTAIN ALL OF THE DATA. THAT HAS BEEN- A PART OF THAT ONE OTHER PART THAT WE'RE GOING TO ADJUST ON THE BILL IS ALSO- TO MAKE DOCUMENTATION MORE CLEAR- OFTENTIMES WHAT HAPPENS IS SOMEBODY HAS TALK TO THEIR PHYSICIAN THEY'RE ATTENDING ABOUT THIS AND- THE PERSON MIGHT SAY OKAY. BUT THEN WHEN pIT'S ACTUALLY TIME THEY'RE LIKE WELL I DON'T WANT TO PARTICIPATE WE'RE ASKING THAT THAT BE DOCUMENTED RIGHT AWAY. AND AS SOON AS I REQUEST IS MADE. AT THE TRANSFER THAT THAT PATIENTS MEDICAL RECORDS TO A SECOND POSITION. THAT THAT REQUEST THAT BE HONORED AND DOCUMENTED RIGHT AWAY- SO THOSE ARE THE AREAS THAT WE ARE WORKING IN AND ALSO TO BE ABLE TO SAY- BECAUSE OFTEN TIMES WHEN IT WHEN A POSITION IS GOING TO PRESCRIBE THEY SEE CAN'T TAKE THIS IN A PUBLIC PLACE. WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THAT DOES NOT MEAN A HOSPITAL YOU ARE ALLOWED TO USE IT IN HOSPITAL IF A- HOSPITAL IS A- IS PARTICIPATING OR- DOESN'T HAVE LAWS. THAT BEARD THAT BAR PEOPLE FROM BEING ABLE TO UTILIZE. A LOT LIKE THIS. SO. THAT IS THAT WHAT WE'RE ASKING IN THIS BILL TO TAKE IT FROM FIFTH. DAY TO FORTY EIGHT AS PROVED BE A BEAR- WE ARE ASKING. THAT WE REMOVE THE SUNSET. WE'RE ASKING THAT THE DOCUMENTATION BE MORE CLEAR AND WE'RE ASKING THE FINAL ATTESTATION BE REMOVED AND WE ARE ASKING. THAT THE- THAT IT BE CLEARLY DOCUMENTED THAT THIS CAN BE DONE IN IN A- IN A HOSPITAL SETTING AT THAT WASN'T MEANT TO BE LIKE A PARK. OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT- SO WITH ME TODAY I HAVE. A DOCTOR KATHERINE. FORREST AND DIE IN DR RYAN SPIELVOGEL- TO SPEAK WITH ME. IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU TO HAVE THOSE TWO WITNESSES LISTED DR FORCED AND DOCTOR SPIELVOGEL BOTH ON THE TELEPHONE.

I HAVE SUPPORTED MY PATIENTS UNDER THE CALIFORNIA END OF LIFE OPTION IT SINCE TWENTY SIXTEEN. BECAUSE IT'S A VERY POWERFUL TOOL FOR THEM AT THE END OF THEIR LIVES TO BE ABLE TO GET A LITTLE BIT OF THAT POWER BACK. UNFORTUNATELY MANY PATIENTS ENCOUNTER OBSTACLES TRYING ACCESS MEDICAL AID IN DYING. IN ONE OF THOSE BIGGEST OBSTACLES WHICH YOU'VE ALREADY HEARD ABOUT TODAY'S THE FIFTEEN DAY WAITING PERIOD. I HAVE UNFORTUNATELY KNOWN TOO MANY PATIENTS WHO HAVE DIED DURING IT. HOW ONE THAT COMES TO MIND OFTEN IS A PATIENT OF MINE HIS NAME WAS TIM. HE WAS A DENTIST WHO WORKED WITH DOCTORS WITHOUT BORDERS FOR MANY YEARS BEFORE HE DEVELOPED PAYLESS. AND I RECALL QUITE VIVIDLY AND WITH NOT A SMALL AMOUNT OF PAIN HOW HE BEGGED ME TO BEND THE RULES IN PRESCRIBED AID IN DYING MEDICATION BEFORE THE FIFTEEN DAY WAITING PERIOD WAS OVER. BECAUSE HE HAD PROGRESSED SO RAPIDLY THAT WE BOTH. KNEW THAT HE MIGHT NOT MAKE IT THROUGH. HAVE COURSE I KNEW THAT I COULDN'T BUT HIS SUFFERING WAS WAS REALLY PALPABLE IN IT PULLED AT ME. AND HE DIED ON THE LAST DAY OF THE WAITING PERIOD. TO AN OUTSIDE OBSERVER MANY SUCH DEATHS MIGHT SEEM SERENE AS A PATIENT IS PUMPED FULL OF MEDICATIONS TO HELP THEM NOT FEEL DISCOMFORT. BUT TO MANY OF THESE PATIENTS EVERY WAKING MOMENT BECOMES A SPECIAL TYPE OF TORTURE. AS A PHYSICIAN WHO SEES HOW IMPORTANT THIS LAW WORKS AND HOW IT WORKS ON THE GROUND I URGE YOU TO VOTE YES ON SB THREE EIGHTY. IT STILL MAINTAINS THE DOZEN COURSE SAFEGUARDS THAT PROTECT VULNERABLE POPULATIONS AND REMOVE UNNECESSARY BARRIERS THAT PREVENT DYING CALIFORNIA'S FROM ACCESSING THE LOG.

TWENTY EIGHT INDEPENDENCE ENTERS AND WE REPRESENT ABOUT THIRTY SIX OF THE EIGHT COUNTIES IN THE STATE- PROVIDING PROGRAMS AND SERVICES FOR THOUSANDS OF INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES ACROSS THE STATE- WE ARE OPPOSED TO THE END OF LIFE ACT BACK IN TWENTY FIFTEEN. AND TODAY AS VERY EXAMINE THIS TO- WE POSE THE CHANGES DETAILED IN THIS BILL SB THREE EIGHTY. WE BELIEVE IT'S HIGHLY PREMATURE TO REMOVE THE TWENTY TWENTY SIX SUNSET CLAUSE FROM CURRENT LAW. AND AS A MATTER OF A PRACTICE. IN THE IN THE IN THIS BUILDING- SUNSET PROVISIONS ARE KEY TOOL USED BY THE LEGISLATURE TO FORCE THE LEAD TO. REVIEW HOW LAWS FUNCTIONING EXAMINE EVERYTHING FROM THE PLANTATION TO ENFORCEMENT. TO IF THE LAWS EVEN BEING UTILIZED INTENDED. IN SB THREE EIGHTY BY REMOVING THE CLAUSE FIVE YEARS EARLY WE FEEL IT'S MUCH TOO SOON. ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE LACK OF- REAL DATA AVAILABLE TO DETERMINE THE VERY REAL AND FAR REACHING IMPACTS OF THIS LAW. INCLUDING BRING INTO LIKE ANY ABUSES OR MISCONDUCT- THE PROBLEM WE'RE FACING DAY THAT THAT THERE IS A VERY SERIOUS ABSENCE OF THE DATA WE MAYBE MANY WHEN I SAY THIS MEANS THERE ARE NO ABUSES ARE CONCERNS. INSTEAD THIS IS ACTUALLY INDICATIVE OF A MUCH BROADER PROBLEM. THE NON COMPLIANCE A NON REPORTING A SIGNIFICANT DATA POINTS IN RELATION TO THOSEWHO UTILIZE PROVISIONS OF CURRENT LAW. A COUPLE AREAS OF CONCERN. WITH THE CURRENT DATA WE DON'T HAVE INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT. PATIENTS ILLNESSES EVEN WERE- WHEN THERE'RE CONCERNING THE MEDICATION. THERE NO STATS ABOUT REFERRALS FOR PSYCHOLOGICAL EVALUATIONS- WE FEEL THERE. ARE BEEN NO REASONS LISTED FOR PATIENTS DEATH REQUESTS UNLIKE IN OTHER STATES. AND WE DON'T THINK IS DATA RELATED TO THE MOST CRITICAL TIME IN THE WHOLE PROCESS WHEN THE PATIENT AND JUST LEGAL DRUGS- MOVING ON. WE FEEL THAT- WE DON'T SEE ANY REQUIREMENT FOR SOMEONE TO BE PRESENT AT THE TIME OF THE INGESTION. NOT PRESCRIBING DOCTOR NORTE OBJECTIVE WITNESS YOU CAN REPORT BACK TO US THE DEPARTMENT HEALTH. AND WE DISAPPROVED SB THREE EIGHTY WITH THE SENSOR CLOTHING REMOVED IT'S TOO PREMATURE. AND ON BEHALF OF SEE IF I'LL SEE I STRONGLY URGE OPPOSITION. THANK YOU. SO THEN WE HAVE SERRANO OVER IT. YEAH.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR WE HAVE NO FURTHER OPPOSITION IN QUEUE AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU FOR YOU THE MAY CLOSE THE LINES WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. RIGHT HIS ADDRESS. I DO WANT TO BEGIN BY THANKING THE SENATOR GREAT RESPECT FOR SUCH A EGGMAN THE WORK THAT SHE DOES IN THIS AS AN ASSEMBLY MEMBER NOW AS A SENATOR. I HAVE HAD CONVERSATIONS WITH THE SENATORS WORLD WAS WITH US WITH THOSE WHO SUPPORT AND THOSE WHO OPPOSE THIS BILL. THERE ARE. SOME THERE IS SOME DATA THAT HAS BEEN COLLECTED SO FAR FROM THE CALIFORNIA STATE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. IT SHOWS THAT OVER 65% OF THOSE WHO'VE. ACTUALLY CONDUCTED GESTEDE- THE MEDICATION AND- THE. 1810065% ARE OVER THE AGE OF SEVENTY. IT IS ABOUT EQUAL BETWEEN MEN AND WOMEN. 75% HAVE SOME COLLEGE. OR UP TO A DOCTORATE DEGREE. THE MEDICATION OUR FLIGHT. I DO APPRECIATE MOST ESPECIALLY THE COMMENTS OF THE TESTIMONY FROM DR CATHERINE REGARDING HER HUSBAND. THOSE ARE VERY REAL CASES. I KNOW THAT IN THE FIVE YEARS SINCE THIS WAS IMPLEMENTED TWENTY EIGHT HUNDRED HAVE ASKED FOR THE PRESCRIPTION EIGHTEEN HUNDRED HAVE ACTUALLY INGESTED IT. THE TESTIMONY GIVEN TODAY ALSO IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. ON A PERSONAL NOTE TO MAKE SURE THIS WITH THE SENATOR MY FATHER WAS DIAGNOSED WITH TERMINAL CANCER WAS GIVEN SIX TO LIVE. THE SIX WEEKS WERE EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO THE FAMILY I RECOGNIZE THAT NOT EVERYBODY FEELS THE SAME WAY AND SOME MAY WANT TO MAKE THE DECISION NOT TO HAVE TO GO THROUGH THAT. THAT IS SOMETHING THAT I HOPE WILL BE ADDRESSED THERE'S NO REASON FOR ANYONE TO HAVE PHYSICAL PAIN. DURING THEIR END OF LIFE PERIOD. THERE WAS ANECDOTAL TESTIMONY. AND I STAY ON A TOTAL BECAUSE THERE IS NOTHING IN THE DATA THAT IS COLLECTED AT THAT WOULD TELL US. THAT FROM THE TIME THAT SOMEBODY FIRST REQUESTED. THE TO BE CONSIDERED FOR THIS TO THE TIME THREE DECISIONS IS MADE THAT THEY HAVE PASSED AWAY WE DON'T HAVE THERE'S NO DATA THAT HAS BEEN COLLECTED REGARDING THAT. MY GREATEST CONCERN WITH THE BILL. THREE THINGS. REDUCING THE TIME PERIOD TO MAKE THIS DECISION FROM TWO WEEKS DOWN TO TWO DAYS. REMOVING THE SUNSET ALL TOGETHER AND I RECOGNIZE THAT- YOUR YOUR TIME. HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE IS LIMITED BUT THERE ARE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO SUPPORTED THIS THAT I THINK. HAVING THE SUNSET EXTENDED I THINK WOULD PROVIDE THEM AN OPPORTUNITY TO BRING THIS UP AGAIN. THE OTHER IS THE REMOVAL OF THE REQUIREMENT FOR MENTAL EVALUATION OR PSYCH PSYCHIATRIC PSYCHOLOGICAL EVALUATION. TODAY HAPPENS TO BE MY FATHER'S BIRTHDAY. THAT WE CELEBRATE IN A DIFFERENT WAY. BUT I THINK THE. THE SAFEGUARDS PROVIDED IN YOUR INITIAL BILL. AB X. TO FIFTEEN I THINK PROVIDE US ENOUGH OF AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THOSE WHO WANT TO AVAIL THEMSELVES OF. OF THIS OPTION. TO BE ABLE TO DO IT AND IN FACT EIGHTEEN HUNDRED PEOPLE HAVE DONE IT. IN THE FIVE YEARS SINCE THIS WAS FIRST PASSED. I DO WANT TO SEE MORE INFORMATION I DO WANT TO DATE THE SPECIFICALLY FROM THE TIME IT IS FIRST REQUESTED TO THE TIME IT THIS THIS LEAD TIME THAT HAS BEEN TESTIFIED TO. I'D LIKE TO KNOW MORE ABOUT THAT. FOUR I COMPLETELY VOTE TO DO AWAY WITH THE SUNSET. AND IT IS FOR THOSE REASONS THAT TODAY RIGHT. WILL BE WILL BE LAYING OFF ON THE BILL. THANK YOU THIS GONZALEZ. THANK YOU- AGAIN EIGHT EIGHT ECHO- MY COLLEAGUES. DISCUSSION ABOUT HOW MUCH WE RESPECT YOU KNOW AND I THINK THAT THAT'S CLEAR BUT I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO SAY AND I KNOW THAT WE'VE HAD SO MANY DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THIS- PROBABLY COULD CHARGE ME FOR THERAPY AFTER THE MANY YEARS WE'VE DISCUSSES. LIKE MY COLLEAGUE- I WATCHED MY MOM DIED OF CANCER AND- IN FIVE DAYS IT WOULD HAVE BEEN HER. SEVENTY SEVENTH BIRTHDAY- IT WAS QUITE AWHILE AGO SHE SHE PASSED AWAY AND I ALSO HAVE SUCH DEEP EMPATHY- FOR THE COLORS WHO TALKED ABOUT THE PAIN AND WITNESSING LOVED ONES AND WHAT THEY GO THROUGH ON AND I DO BELIEVE WE HAVE TO DO A BETTER JOB OF- HELPING PEOPLE. BELIEVE EIGHT THEIR PAIN. I DIDN'T VOTE FOR THE INITIAL BILL AND WHEN THIS- CAME ABOUT. A- I. THOUGHT I HAVE TO BE HONEST AND TAKE A SECOND LOOK AT THIS. BUT I AM ALSO CONCERNED THAT WE'RE CHANGING THE WAIT PERIOD AND GETTING RID OF THE SUNSET- I THINK THOSE TWO THINGS TOGETHER DON'T MAKE A LOT OF SENSE TO ME- I HAVE SOME ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS AS OPPOSED TO DEAL AND- PEOPLE WHO- WHAT WE DON'T KNOW IT DID THEY DIE- AND NOT TAKE THE MEDICATION OR- ARE THEY STILL LIVE- I REALLY WOULD LIKE TO SEE MORE INFORMATION. ABOUT PEOPLE'S LIFE EXPENSE EXPECTANCY IN WHAT THEY'RE TOLD AND HOW LONG THEY LIVE I HAVE A BEEN VERY OPEN SHE'S BEEN OPEN SIGN I WILL SAVE A DISTRICT DIRECTOR WHO IS BATTLING NOW STAGE FOR LUNG CANCER THAT HAS SPREAD TO HER BRAIN AND BONES AND- YOU KNOW WE JUST PASSED THE TWO YEAR ANNIVERSARY AND SHE WAS. SHE WERE QUALIFIED FOR- THIS DRUG WHEN SHE WAS INITIALLY- DIAGNOSED SO. I ALSO HAVE CONCERNS AND WILL CONTINUE HAVE CONCERNS- FOR INDIVIDUALS. ALTHOUGH IT HASN'T REACHED THE UNDERSERVED YET WHO MAY SEE THIS IS NOT A CHOICE BECAUSE WE DON'T. PROVIDE ADEQUATE HEALTH CARE FREE HEALTH CARE AND- THERE IS A VERY REAL POSSIBILITY AS THIS EXPANDS WITH US. KATHLEEN THE VERY- WHAT I FIND IMPORTANT ASPECT OF SINGLE PAYER UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE FOR PEOPLE TO BE GIVEN A FALSE CHOICE. A CHOICE OF BURNING THEIR FAMILY WITH WITH MEDICAL BILLS- EXTENSIVE MEDICAL BILLS OR OF CUTTING SHORT THEIR LAST DAYS WITH THEIR FAMILY AND I WORRY ABOUT THAT- BECAUSE WE'VE ALL SEEN PEOPLE MAKE DECISIONS THAT. ARE RATIONAL DECISIONS EVEN IF YOU WILL FOR THEIR FAMILIES AND I THINK IT UNTIL WE CAN GET TO A POINT WHERE INDIVIDUALS TRULY HAVE THE ABILITY TO MAKE A DECISION. NOT BASED ON- A FAULTY MEDICAL SYSTEM THAT WOULD THAT WOULD CURRENTLY HAVE- THAT I CANNOT SUPPORT THIS BILL BUT I DO WANT TO THANK YOU FOR. I KNOW THIS ALL SOUNDS STRANGE BUT CONTINUING TO CHALLENGE ME- I THINK AT. WHAT YOU'RE DOING. YOU BELIEVE IS RIGHT I JUST WISH WE HAD MORE INFORMATION AND THAT WE WEREN'T DOING BOTH THE SUNSET- ELIMINATION AND A CHANGE IN THE POLICY AT THE SAME TIME- BUT I CAN'T SUPPORT IT TODAY. THANK YOU. BUT THE QUESTIONS ARE COMMON. RIGHT SENATOR I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR DEDICATION TO THE ISSUE AND I KNOW IT WAS ON HOW TO WORK A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO TO GET THE ORIGINAL BILL PASSED AND IT IS HARD. THIS IS ABOUT HUMAN DIGNITY. AND THAT'S WHY IT IS SO IMPORTANT FOR US TO BE RE VISITING US AT THIS POINT. AND CASE IN POINT. WILL FORCE AND MANY OTHERS WE KNEW GOING IN THAT MANY WOULD. CONTEMPLATE THE OPTION BUT NOT TAKE THE OPTION AND THAT'S WITH THE DIGNITY COMES IN IS WHEN SOMEONE WHO IS GOING THROUGH THE PROCESS OF DYING. AND CAN DO SOMETHING TO TAKE CONTROL THEMSELVES AND WHETHER NOT THE EXERCISE THAT CONTROL JUST HAVING THAT OPTION IS FOR THE DIGNITY COMES IN BECAUSE THERE'S SO MANY OTHER FACTORS THAT ARE AT PLAY WHEN SOMEONE IS GOING THROUGH THE PROCESS OF DYING THIS IS JUST THAT. MODICUM OF CONTROL FOR THAT INDIVIDUAL AND THAT'S WHY. IS A VERY IMPORTANT BILL FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND I THINK THIS ALSO IS A VERY IMPORTANT ILL. FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AS WE HAVE LEARNED OVER FIVE YEARS. THAT A LOT OF THE FEARS THAT LED TO THE COMPROMISES THAT YOU TOOK. I HAVE NOT REALLY BEEN REALIZED EITHER A LOT OF OTHER THINGS GOING ON AND WORRIES ABOUT THE MEDICAL DELIVERY SYSTEM. THAT IS ON ALL OF US TO CONTINUE TO MANAGE AND ENSURE THAT WE HAVE. APPROPRIATE ARTICLE ACCESS FOR EVERYONE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THIS IS A VERY SMALL SUBSET. AND THIS IS A REALLY BILL ABOUT DIGNITY SO IT IT IS. PAST TIME WE LOOKED AT THIS AND WE START TO RELAX NOT SOME OF THE REAL. PROTECTIONS THAT YOU'VE GOT IN HERE AND I KNOW YOU'RE NOT TOUCHING THOSE BUT I THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE TO TAKE THE SUNSE OFF. THE WAITING PERIOD. WE CAN HEAR FROM THE MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS WHO HAVE BEEN ACTIVELY ENGAGE WITH INDIVIDUALS WANTING TO TAKE THIS OPTION. THAT THEY FEEL THAT IS AN IMPORTANT STEP. AGAIN FOR THE EXISTING DIGNITY FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS SO I. RESTATE THE YOU BROUGHT THIS FORWARD AND- THAT- ALSO HOPING WE WILL MOVE THIS OUT OF OUR COMMITTEE TODAY SO. WITH THAT SENATOR MAKE CLUBS THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I WANT I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR YOUR- YOUR COMMENTS AND THE TIME I KNOW YOU TOOK WITH THIS AND I KNOW EVERY TIME I BRING SOMETHING LIKE THIS UP. IT BRINGS BACK YOUR MOTHER AND IT BRINGS BACK YOUR FATHER I KNOW THAT RIGHT THAT THAT IS A PART OF LIFE RIGHT THAT WE ALL GO THROUGH AND EVERY TIME THAT WE LOSE SOMEBODY WE LOVE SO DEARLY. WE EXPERIENCED EVERYBODY'S DEATH ALL OVER AGAIN AND SO- AND WE AS HUMANS ARE ARE DEATH DEFYING CREATURES RIGHT WE FORM WHERE THERE'S NO WATER WE CAN BUILD BRIDGES A I MEAN WE DO THINGS THAT PEOPLE. YOU KNOW JUST BECAUSE WE THINK WE'RE GONNA LIVE FOREVER. BUT THE TRUTH IS WE'RE NOT WE ARE ALL GOING TO DIE AND SOME PEOPLE WANT THE OPTION OF MAINTAINING THEIR DEATHS LIKE THEY'VE MAINTAINED THEIR LIFE- I'LL SHARE WITH YOU EITHER HAVE A VERY CLOSE FRIEND THAT IS A PART OF MY FAMILY WERE IN OUR ARTICLE COVERED BUBBLE TOGETHER AGAIN HE MENACE- HELLO LATINO. CATHOLIC AT AND HE WAS DIAGNOSED WITH COLON CANCER TWENTY THIRTEEN HOUSING ABOUT THAT BECAUSE I WE NURSED HIM THROUGH THAT ARE VERY CLOSE TO ALL UP IN THE GABER HOOD THERE IN VICTORY PARK NEIGHBORHOOD- AND HE MADE IT- HE HE NOW HAS STAGE FOUR LUNG CANCER AND HE'S HAD THAT NOW FOR FOUR YEARS- AND HE HAS A VERY. FLAMBOYANT BEAUTIFUL MAN- DIAMOND DAN AND HE CURRENTLY HAS BLISTERS ALL OVER HIS HEAD AND HIS FACE. IN HIS CHEST- INTO IS NOT AS PRETTY BUT HE WEARS FANCY CLASSES AND HATS TO BE ABLE TO STILL BE AS PRETTY AS HE LIKE TO BE. AND WE TAKE HIM TO CHEMO EVERY SINGLE WEEK AND WE NURSING AFTER THAT AND HAVE DONE THAT FOR FOUR YEARS. AND WILL CONTINUE TO. YOU CAN. OVER TO MY HOUSE. AND I NOTICED TALK ABOUT THIS THIS WEEK. HE'S A GIRL. THE DOCTOR SAID. NO MARKING AND I SAID WHAT WHAT'S NEXT DOCTOR AND HE SAID THERE'S NOTHING LEFT. AND YOU SAID IT IT TOOK ME FROM AND I SAID IT HAS TO BE SO THEY'RE GONNA TRY EXPERIMENTAL THINGS AND HE'S GOING TO HE'S GOING TO DO IT. BECAUSE HE HAS SUCH A WILL TO LIVE BECAUSE HE GETS TO GO DOWN TO PUERTO VALLARTA. TWO TIMES A YEAR AND WE ALL HELP SO HE CAN DO THAT BECAUSE HE DID NOT HAVE ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE WE'VE GOT A MEMETIC CAL ALL THOSE THINGS NOW WE TOOK CARE OF. AND I KNOW WHAT THE AND I DON'T KNOW FOR SURE. BUT I THINK HE'S GOING TO USE THIS. AND THERE IS NO WAY THAT MAN HAS NOT FOUGHT. WAY HARDER THAN I KNOW ANYBODY WOULD FIGHT TO LIVE BECAUSE HE FEELS SO FABULOUS. THE POINT IS NOT GONNA BE ABLE LIVE FOR EVER AND HE WANTS TO HAVE SOME SAY OVER THE LAST COUPLE THINGS HE HASN'T GIVEN AWAY ALL HIS CHINA I THINK I'M GETTING HIS BIG FANCY LIQUOR CABINET. I'M NOT SURE. HOWEVER I KNOW THIS BRINGS DIGNITY AND PEACE TO PEOPLE. I KNOW THAT AT THE END OF SOME PEOPLE'S LIVES DATE AND TIME WE TALKED ABOUT IT'S NOT LATINOS WHO USES IT IS NOT A LOT OF CATHOLICS WHO USE IT. BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT A LARGE PERCENT OF CATHOLICS SUPPORT THIS AND A LARGE NUMBER OF LATINO SUPPORT THIS- BUT PEOPLE WHO ARE WHITE WHO HAVE COLLEGE EDUCATION AND SOME MONEY HAVE HAD AGENCY THROUGHOUT THEIR LIFE THEY'VE HD AGENCY TO BE ABLE O SEE WHAT THEY WANT WHAT THEYDON'T WANT AND TO LIVE THEIR LIFE IN A DIGNIFIED MANNER THEY WANT. THOSE OF US OF COLOR THOSE OF US ARE DIFFERENT SO SHOULD I HAVE NOT HAD THAT AGENCY THROUGHOUT OUR LIVES AND SOMETIMES DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT OTHER PEOPLE WANT TO BE ABLE. TO SAY WHEN THE END IS HERE. THIS BILL IS NOT REQUIRED FOR ANYBODY IT IS AN OPTION. IT IS AN OPTION THAT SOME PEOPLE LIKE TO UTILIZE. ASSEMBLY MEMBER BUT WE ARE NOT TAKING OUT THE MENTAL EVALUATION THAT IS STILL IN THERE. IT WAS ALWAYS IF IT THE VISIT ONE OF THE PHYSICIANS THOUGHT YOU NEEDED IT. YOU WOULD BE REFERRED THAT IS NOT BEING REMOVED THAT IS THAT IS STILL THERE- IT IS INTERESTING THAT WE DON'T. YOU KNOW I'D LIKE TO BE ABLE TO SAY EXACTLY. HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE DIED WITHIN THAT FIFTEEN DAY WAITING PERIOD. BUT WE DON'T BECAUSE WE ALSO KNOW THAT WHAT A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO GET THE MEDICATION. DON'T EVEN USE IT IT'S JUST KNOWING THAT IT IS THERE THAT IF IT GOT TOO BAD. THAT THEY WOULD HAVE A DIFFERENT OPTION. THAT BRINGS PEOPLE PEACE. AND AT THE END OF PEOPLE'S LIFE. DON'T WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THEM A LITTLE PIECE THAT WE WANT TO GIVE A LET PUT OUR FEARS ASIDE. AND LET PEOPLE MAKE THE ONUS THEIR OWN DECISIONS IN CONJUNCTION WITH THEIR PHYSICIANS. ABOUT THEIR VERY LAST MINUTES ON THIS WORLD. I THINK WE DO. I THINK THERE'S ENOUGH SAFEGUARDS IN PLACE I THINK SOME OF THE SAFEGUARDS TO BECOME BARRIERS. AND I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE.

THE OUTBREAK OF A FOREIGN ANIMAL DISEASE IN OUR STATE COULD TRIGGER COSTLY RECALLS IN DANGER CONSUMER HEALTH AND ARE IN THE FOOD SUPPLY CHAIN WORLDWIDE. CURRENTLY THERE IS NO EXISTING STATE LAW THAT AUTHORIZES CDFA OVERSIGHT AND CERTIFICATION OF LABORATORIES ANALYZING CALIFORNIA POULTRY AND LIVESTOCK SAMPLES. FOR THE PURPOSE OF DETECTING CONDITIONS THAT WOULD TRIGGER A STATE RESPONSE. FURTHER THERE IS NO. REQUIREMENT THAT SUCH LAPTOP HERE TO REGULATIONS PRESENT AN EXISTING STATE RUN LABORATORIES.

GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I AM HAPPY TO BE HERE TO PRESENT SB SEVEN TWO SEVEN WHICH AIMS TO PREVENT WAGE THEFT WITHIN THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY HERE IN CALIFORNIA I WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT WE ARE SEEKING TO GO AFTER THE BAD ACTORS IN THE INDUSTRY AND TO HELP THOSE THAT PLAY BY THE RULES AND MAKE SURE THAT THEIR WORKERS ARE PAID ON TIME. DUE TO THE SKILLS REQUIRED IN THE FAIR WAGES AND BENEFITS WORKERS RECEIVE THE INDUSTRY PROVIDE A PATHWAY TO THE MIDDLE CLASS FOR TENS OF THOUSANDS OF CONSTRUCTION WORKERS WHO COULD AFFORD TO PURCHASE THE HOMES THAT THEY BUILT LIKE MANY OTHER SECTORS CONSTRUCTION WAGES HAVE GONE DOWN BUT WAIT STAFF IN CASH PAYMENTS HAVE INCREASED AND A KEY FACTOR FOR THIS IS A LACK OF ENFORCEMENT OF BASIC LABOR LAWS ON THE JOB SITE. UNSCRUPULOUS CONTRACTORS THAT DO NOT PLAY BY THE RULES HAVE BEEN ILLEGAL AND UNFAIR ADVANTAGE OVER ON ITS CONTRACTORS AS A UNDERMINE WAGES AND WORKING CONDITIONS THROUGHOUT THE INDUSTRY BUT I WILL SHARE TAT WELL SEVENTEEN A ONE BY THEN ASSEMBLY MEMBER THURMAN WHICH TOOK EFFECT IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN HAS BEEN A DIFFERENCE IT HAS NOT DONE ENOUGH SOME CONTRACTORS STILL CONSIDER WAGE THEFT JUST THE COST OF DOING BUSINESS HERE WITH ME TODAY IS DANNY CURTAIN WITH THE CALIFORNIA CONFERENCE OF CARPENTERS. AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU SENATOR I HAVE ONE WITNESS LISTED DANIEL CURTAIN. GO AHEAD PLEASE- THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. LAST APRIL A SUBCONTRACTOR WORKING ON A HOMELESS HOUSING PROJECT WAS CHARGED WITH FAILING TO PAY ITS WORKERS NEARLY ONE MILLION DOLLARS. THE DA'S OFFICE SAID THEY COULD NOT IDENTIFY MANY OF THE WORKERS ELIGIBLE FOR COMPENSATION BECAUSE OF SCANT PAYROLL RECORDS. SB SEVEN TWO SEVEN IS NOT A WAGE BILL THE ONLY WAGE LAW THAT APPLIES IS THE MINIMUM WAGE IT IS A PLAY BY THE RULES BILL. RIGHT NOW THE RULE IS EVERY CONTRACTOR IS REQUIRED BY LAW TO KEEP PAYROLL RECORDS. ABOUT 20% OF OUR CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY DOES NOT PLAY BY THE RULES AND THE STATE LOSES ABOUT THREE BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR IN TAXES. THE LIKELIHOOD OF A CONTRACTOR FACING INSPECTIONS ABOUT ONCE IN EVERY THREE HUNDRED YEARS. TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN THE LABOR COMMISSIONER REPORTED A TWELVE MILLION DOLLAR. WAGE THEFT CASE THE LARGEST IN CALIFORNIA HISTORY. MORE THAN ONE THOUSAND WORKERS WERE CHEATED OUT OF ALMOST TWO MILLION DOLLARS IN WAGES. IT'S STILL IN LITIGATION AND WILL BE FOR YEARS. UNFORTUNATELY JUST 17% OF THE WORKERS WHO NGUYEN RECEIVE EVEN SOME OF THEIR PAY. IN 50% OF CASES THE EMPLOYER SOLD TRANSFERRED OR ABANDON THEIR BUSINESS BEFORE THE JUDGMENT WAS EVEN DELIVER. JOINT AND SEVERAL LIABILITY WILL MAKE A DIFFERENCE. WE'RE NOT IGNORING OUR OPPONENTS CONCERNS WE'VE TAKEN SERIOUS AMENDMENTS REQUESTED BY CONTRACTORS THE MOST IMPORTANT IS THE SAFE HARBOR AMENDMENT. A DIRECT CONTRACTOR CAN PROTECT THEMSELVES FROM ADDED LIABILITY BY ONE. PERIODICALLY MONITORING LEGALLY REQUIRED SUBCONTRACTOR PAYROLL RECORDS AND TO TAKING DILIGENT ACTION INCLUDING WITHHOLDING A SUBCONTRACTORS PROGRESS PAYMENTS. THEY DON'T HAVE TO MONITOR EVERY SUB FOR EVEN ANY SUBS THEY SHOULD KNOW THEIR SUBS THEY SHOULD KNOW THEIR JOBS AND THEIR WORK FORCE NEEDS THEY SHOULD HAVE CONTRACTS WITH RESPONSIBLE LICENSED SUBCONTRACTORS WHO HAVE PAYROLL RECORDS. JUST WEEKS AFTER THE ONE MILLION DOLLAR CASE I MENTIONED WAS ANNOUNCED MORE WAGE VIOLATIONS WERE DISCOVERED THE WHOLE JOB IS CURRENTLY UNDER INVESTIGATION. IRONICALLY THE JOB HAD BEEN THE SITE OF AN EARLIER PRESS CONFERENCE BY KEY OFFICIALS PRAISING THE HOMELESS HOUSING PROJECT FOR THE SPEED OF CONSTRUCTION. AND THE LOW COST. LET'S MAKE SURE THE WORKERSAND HONEST CONTRACTORS DON'T GET LOST WHILE WE ATTEMPT TO SOLVE THE HOUSING CRISIS THIS IS A GOOD BILL IT'S NOT A MIRACLE CURE BUT IT'S AN IMPORTANT BILL. I WANT TO THANK SENATE A LEYVA. AND HER STAFF FOR THE HARD WORK ON THIS BILL PLEASE VOTE YES. ON SB SEVEN TWENTY SEVEN THANK YOU THANK YOU IS THERE ANYONE ELSE IN HERE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF SB SEVEN TWO SEVEN. C. NONE OF THE REMOTE TESTIMONY SITE.

WONDERFUL MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS AGAIN SO WE OVER HERE WE HAVE TO CALIFORNIA BUILDING INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION OPPOSITION- AT THE AUTHOR STATE I'LL AND ONE ALSO REMINDED ME A LITTLE BIT OF HISTORY ON ON HOW WE GOT HERE AND BACK IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN. SEVENTEEN OH ONE ANSWERED- WE THOUGHT IS AN IMPORTANT QUESTION WHICH IS WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN WHEN A SUBCONTRACTOR FAILS TO PAY AN EMPLOYEE. GREEN AT THAT TIME WAS THAT A DIRECT CONTRACTOR IN OUR CASE THE HOME BUILDER. BUT STEP FORWARD HEY THE SUBCONTRACTOR'S EMPLOYEE DIRECTLY SO AT THAT TIME WE'VE ESSENTIALLY PAID TWICE WE PAID THE SUBCONTRACTOR AND WE'VE NOW PAID THE EMPLOYEE. IN THAT SAME AGREEMENT WAS MADE CLEAR THAT WE'RE GONNA STEP UP. DO THE RIGHT THING AND PAY THE EMPLOYEE WE'RE NOT ALSO GOING TO BE PENALIZED FOR DOING SO. HELD A LIQUIDATED DAMAGES WOULD NOT BE PUNITIVELY APPLY TO HOME BUILDER IN THAT CASE. WE PROVIDED SEVERAL DOCUMENTS EACH YEAR OFFICE THAT REINFORCE THAT DEAL. ON THE FIRST HOLE WITH A LETTER FROM THE STATE BUILDING CONSTRUCTION TRADES THAT MEMORIALIZE THAT DEAL AN AGREEMENT. THE SECOND WAS A LETTER FROM CBI RESTATING THE AGREEMENT AS THE REASON FOR GOING NEUTRAL. THERE WAS ALSO A LETTER IN THE JOURNAL FROM ASSEMBLYMEMBER THURMAN THAT REINFORCED THE AGREEMENT. AND LAST WITH A FUNDING MESSAGE FROM GOVERNOR BROWN THAT STATED THE OFTEN SPONSORS THE BILL HAVE COMMITTED TO PROPOSING LEGISLATION NEXT YEAR. TO RESOLVE THE DISPUTE AND IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE NEXT YEAR. AB FIFTEEN SIXTY FIVE BY THURMAN WAS PASSED AND SIGNED. AND RESOLVE THE DISPUTE. SEVEN TWENTY SEVEN IS A DOING ALL OF THAT WERE. THAT BEING SAID WE'VE MADE A CLEAR. THAT WE ARE WELL. TO GO ALONG WITH SOME BILLS FOR. SO LONG AS THE STATE PUT THAT HAVE BEEN REFERENCED ACTUALLY WORK. IN A MEANINGFUL. WE HAVE OFFERED THREE SETS AMENDMENTS TO DATE. WE HAVEN'T RECEIVED WHAT I WOULD REFER TO A SUBSTANTIVE FEEDBACK TO THOSE AMENDMENTS- WE TALK WITH. YOU ABOUT OUR OUR LATEST REQUEST WHICH IS SIMPLY TO ALLOW ALTERNATE COMPLIANCE PATH. OF THE DIVISION OF LABOR STANDARDS ENFORCEMENT CAN CONDUCT THE REVIEW. IN OUR MINDS THAT IS PRO WORKER. THEY ARE THE AGENCIES THAT ARE THE RIGHT PEOPLE TO DO THE REVIEW HAVE THE WORK RIGHT SKILL SET TO DO THE REVIEW. AND ABSENT THE ABILITY TO USE THEM AS THE REVIEWING AGENCY OUR VIEW IS THAT THIS IS REALLY SETTING UP HOME BUILDERS TO FAIL AND THEN BE PENALIZED FOR IT. SO WERE STRONGLY OPPOSED WE BELIEVE WE'VE OFFERED MEANINGFUL AMENDMENTS TO PUT THIS IN THE RIGHT HANDS OF THE RIGHT PEOPLE- AND UNTIL WE CAN MAKE SOME HEADWAY ON A MAN'S. WE WOULD URGE YOUR HELP OUT. THANK YOU. THIRTY ONE IN THE HEARING ROOM WHO'D LIKE TO IT UP OF B. C. SO. SEE NONE AT THE REMOTE TESTIMONY SITE.

THANK YOU I HAVE NO FURTHER COMMENTS THANK YOU AT THIS TIME. I THINK YOU ARE FRIENDLY YOU MAY CLOSE THE LINES ON SB SEVEN TWO SEVEN AND I'LL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. IT IS REYES THE MINISTER HOLDEN. THANK YOU SENATOR- IT I THINK IT WAS CLEAR SPECIALLY FROM THE- THE ANALYSIS THAT EVEN WITH THE LEGISLATION TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THERE'S BEEN NO EFFECTIVE DETERRENTS FOR CONTINUE WAGE THEFT VIOLATIONS- AND I APPRECIATE THAT THE TESTIMONY FROM MISTER CURTAIN REGARDING THE VERY ISSUES THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. AND I APPRECIATE ALSO YOUR COMMENTS INITIALLY THAT THIS HELPS THE HONEST CONTRACTORS- EIGHT IN PCS SCRUPULOUS ONES WHO STEAL AND ALLOW SUBCONTRACTORS TO STILL FROM THE VERY WORKERS WHO HELP THEM BUILD THEIR PROJECTS SO WITH THAT I WOULD MOVE THE BILL. THANK YOU THANK YOU SO WE DO HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND MR HOLDEN. THANKS THANK YOU SENATOR- AS I'VE MENTIONED TO YOU BEFORE I'M SUPPORTING YOUR BILL I BELIEVE THAT- WELL YOU HAD ME AT THE BILL TO ADDRESS WAGE THAT SO- AND I KNOW THAT OVER. A PERIOD OF TIME THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS BEEN VERY AGGRESSIVE IN ADDRESSING THIS ISSUE IN VARIOUS SECTORS OF TE MARKET PLACE AND I THINK WE RIGHTEOUSLY SO- I WANTED TO ASK YOU A QUESTION AROUND THIS ALTERNATIVE TO THE SAFE HARBOR- BECAUSE I THINK. IT I DON'T EVEN IF YOU'RE WILLING THIS ACCEPT THIS AMENDMENT I'M NOT SURE I'VE HEARD FROM. THE OPPOSITION THAT THEY WOULD REMOVE THEIR OPPOSITION- I'D BE INTERESTED TO KNOW IF THEY WOULD. BUT I'M JUST CURIOUS BECAUSE THE DIVISION OF LABOR STANDARDS ENFORCEMENT. DOES SEEM LIKE A- APPROPRIATE AREA OR AGENCY TO BILLY KIND OF GET IN THERE AND- AND MAYBE DO A VERY THOROUGH. AND THOUGHTFUL INVESTIGATION OF THESE RECORDS ARE TO BE ABLE TO COME BACK WITH. SOME CLEAR VIOLATIONS OF ANY- AND SO I WAS JUST CURIOUS AS TO. WHETHER YOU THOUGHT IF THERE WAS A PROBLEM WITH THIS APPROACH AS AN ALTERNATIVE WHICH YOU ALREADY HAVE IN THE BILL- WHAT YOUR THOUGHTS ARE ON. THAT WHICH YOU THINK THIS DOES OR DOESN'T DO AS A AS A PROPRIA MEHMET TO THE BILL ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER FOR THE QUESTION SO I THINK THAT PEOPLE GET VERY ENAMORED WHEN THEY HEAR A BUSINESS THEY WILL PAY FOR IT- AND WIND- WE LOOK AT D. LOC AS WHERE THEY WOULD HOUSE THIS. DEAL AS HE DOES THIS NOT HAVE THE CAPACITY TO DO THAT AND IF THE CORPORATION IF THESE IF BE A IS WILLING TO PAY FOR IT THEY CAN HIRE A COMPANY THEY KIND OF HURT A COMPANY YEARS AGO THEY CAN HIRE A COMPANY TODAY. THAT DOES THE AUDITING FOR THEM. I PERSONALLY SEE THIS AS A STALL TACTIC BECAUSE IF WE PUT IT INTO THE GOVERNMENT TO DO WE ALL KNOW GOVERNMENT MOVES SLOWLY I WISH THAT IT DID NOT BUT IT DOES BUT THIS IS GOING TO CREATE A WHOLE NEW DEPARTMENT. WE REACHED OUT TO DELISTING WE HAVEN'T EVEN HEARD BACK FROM THEM SO IF THEY CAN'T EVEN RETURN OUR CALL ABOUT THIS IT MAKES ME WONDER IF THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO ACTUALLY ENACT THIS PROGRAM. AND TO ASSEMBLY WOMAN RAISES POINT SEVENTEEN NO ONE WENT A LONG WAY IN HELPING WITH WAGE THEFT BUT IT DIDN'T GO ALL THE WAY UNTIL WE MAKE SURE THAT NO WORKER. LOSES PAY ON NO CONTRACTOR- THINKS OF- WAGE THEFT AS A COST OF DOING BUSINESS WE HAVEN'T DONE OUR JOB WE HAVE SPOKEN WITH BE A MANY TIMES WE'VE LISTENED TO ALL OF THEIR CONCERNS. YOU KNOW MR FOR OUR SAID THAT THEY HAVE OFFERED MEANINGFUL AMENDMENTS WELL I KNOW THAT THEY THINK THEY'RE MEANINGFUL ANYONE IN OPPOSITION WHO OFFERS AMENDMENTS THINK SERMON AMENDMENTS ARE MEANINGFUL SO I DON'T DISAGREE WITH HIM ON THAT POINT. WE JUST DON'T THINK THE AMENDMENTS ENHANCE THE BILL WE THINK IN. SOME POINTS IT EVEN HURTS THE BILL. I THANK YOU. THOSE OUT. YEAH THANK YOU SENATOR- SO SOMEONE WHO SUPPORTED SEVENTEEN NO. ONE- YOU KNOW I. AND THE WHOLE AT THE CONCEPT AS I REMEMBER IT BACK THEN I MEAN THAT WAS A FEW YEARS AGO BUT THE CONCEPT WAS HAVE BEEN GENERAL HAS A JOB IN THE SUB CAN'T CONTRACT IT DOESN'T DO IT LET'S HAVE. LIABILITY THERE BECAUSE SINCE IT'S THE WHOLE PROJECT THEY'RE THE ONE OVERSEEN RIGHT- BUT THE DEAL WAS AND I THINK IT'S ALREADY BEEN TALKED ABOUT BUT THE DEAL WAS IS THAT WE'RE NOT HAVING PENALTIES ASSOCIATED WITH THAT GENERAL BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT THE ONE WHO. DID THAT IT WAS THE SUB WHO ACTUALLY DID THAT AND AS WE FOLLOW THROUGH ON THAT WE HAD LEGISLATION TO CLEAN THAT UP THE NEXT YEAR BY. MR THURMAN'S. AND I FEEL LIKE THIS IS KIND OF GOING BACK ON. WHAT THAT PRINCIPLE WAS. AS I UNDERSTAND IT THERE'S ONLY BEEN ONE CASE WHERE WE HAD. WHERE SEVENTEEN NO ONE. WAS USED TO ENSURE THAT SOMEONE. WAS PAID. SO IT'S NOT LIKE WE'VE HAD A LOT OF THESE TYPE OF CASES OUT THERE- AND AGAIN I THINK THAT THE LAW IS WORKING I THINK THE OTHER THINGS THAT WE HAVE A PLACE- THE LABOR COMMISSIONER AND OTHERS. OUR ENFORCEABLE AND ARE A RESULT IN ENSURING THAT WORKERS GET PAID SO. I JUST DON'T SEE THE NEED AND NOT LOOK UP IN SUPPORT OF THE CONCEPT OF I THINK THERE ARE CASES WHERE GENERAL'S NEED TO BE LIABLE FOR THE FACT THAT THIS DOESN'T HAPPEN. BUT WE START THROWING IN PENALTIES THAT USUALLY ASSOCIATE WITH AN INTENTIONAL NONPAYMENT OF- OF WAGES WHICH IN THIS CASE IS A SUB. IT IS DONE THAT NOT THE GENERAL SO I JUST I FEEL LIKE HAVING PEOPLE ALMOST LIKE A PAYMENT PUNITIVE DAMAGES PENALTIES. ON SOMEONE WHO WASN'T THE DIRECT THAT ACTOR JUST DOESN'T SEEM LIKE THE RIGHT APPROACH TO THE AND I MEAN. SO I WOULD JUST RESPOND WITH THIS IS SOMEONE WHO NEGOTIATED CONTRACTS FOR MANY YEARS BEFORE I RAN FOR OFFICE. WITHOUT A PENALTY IT'S JUST A SUGGESTION SEVENTEEN NO ONE IS A SUGGESTION THERE IT WITHOUT AN ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM WITH THE PENALTY THEN WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE CONTRACTOR DOESN'T PAY WHEN THE SUB DOESN'T PAY WHAT HAPPENS THEN TO THE WORKER. THEY'RE THE ONES WHO SUFFER AND IF YOU DO IT RIGHT AND IF YOU DON'T AND YOU ABIDE BY THE LAW THEN THE PENALTY IS NOT A PROBLEM. AND I MEAN IF YOU WOULD LIKE I CAN ASK- MY WITNESS TO TALK ABOUT THE SEVENTEEN A ONE TO GO SHE ASIANS BUT- THIS IS A DIFFERENT BILL. IT'S A DIFFERENT AUTHOR IT'S GOING TO A DIFFERENT GOVERNOR IF SEVENTEEN OH ONE WERE WORKING IN ITS ENTIRETY THIS BILL WOULDN'T BE NEEDED. BUT IT ISN'T SO THAT'S WHY SEVEN TWO SEVEN IS NEEDED. BUT DOESN'T WORK BECAUSE THE IDEA IS THAT IF THEY DON'T GET PAID IN THE GENERAL. IS LIABLE AND YOU CAN ACTUALLY COLLECT FROM THAT GENERAL. THE UNPAID WAGES THAT WASN'T SO SEVENTEEN OH ONE IS NOT A SUGGESTION IT'S A LEGALLY BINDING LAW. THAT PUTS THEM ON THE HOOK AND- AT LEAST RIGHT NOW THE ONLY WE ONLY HAVE ONE DOCUMENTED CASE WHERE THIS HAPPENED AND THEY DID PAY THEM. I DON'T THINK THERE'S ONLY ONE DOCUMENTED CASE WE HAVE A- REPORT THAT SAYS IS ABOUT FORTY PERCENT. OF WORKERS WHO- HOW ARE THEIR WAGES HAVE BEEN STOLEN SO THAT I DON'T THINK THAT THAT IS JUST ONE CASE. AND IF YOU HAVE THERE ARE CASES WHAT. HAVE THEY BROUGHT CASES US AND TRY TO RECOVER FROM THE GENERAL FUND. IT AND IF THEY DON'T IF THE GENERAL DOESN'T HERE HERE'S THE IMPORTANT PART ABOUT SEVEN TO SEVEN VERSUS SEVENTEEN OH ONE. IF THEY ARE NOT PAID. THEN WHAT HAPPENS TO THE GENERAL NOTHING. THERE'S NO PENALTY FOR NOT PAYING YOUR WORKERS THERE'S NO PENALTY NOTHING HAPPENS. BUT THE WORKER DOESN'T GET PAID HE'S THE ONE OR SHE'S THE ONE WHO CAN'T PAY THEIR BILLS I GUESS THAT'S WHY I'M CONFUSED. MY UNDERSTAND IS THAT YES THEY DO GET PAID BECAUSE THEY THEY SEE THE GENERAL THE GENERAL HAS TO PAY THEM. IF THEY ARE NOT THAT GENERAL GETS PENALIZED ENOUGH TO PAY ADDITIONAL PENALTIES AND DAMAGES THAT'S THAT'S- THAT'S YOUR BILL. RIGHT BUT TO SAY THAT THEY DON'T GET PAID THAT'S NOT TRUE. IT IS TRUE I WOULDN'T BE DOING THE BILL FOR BECAUSE WE'RE GETTING PAID IF WAGE THEFT WASN'T OCCURRING I WOULDN'T BE DOING TO FILL SO. YOU'RE TELLING ME IS RIGHT NOW IF SOMEONE COMES AND SAYS HEY I DIDN'T GET PAID BY MYSELF. AND SUIT IS WHAT JOINED SEVERAL pTHE GENERAL. AND THEY PROVE THEY WEREN'T PAID. THE GENERAL WILL BE ORDERED TO PAY THOSE WAGES SO I'M THE WORKER. AND I DON'T GET PAID. SO I HAVE TO GO GET AN ATTORNEY AND I HAVE TO SUE THE GENERAL WHAT HAPPENS ALL MY BILLS DURING THAT TIME WHO PAYS MY RENT WHO PAYS MY HOUSE PAYMENT. WHO PAYS FOR CHILD CARE WHO PAYS FOR FOOD. SUING SOMEONE. IS NOT THE REMEDY. I MEAN YOU CAN DO IT FOR SURE I MEAN IT IS A REMEDY WELL YEAH BUT I MEAN. I KNOW YOU'RE A LAWYER AND I'M A LAWYER I'M NOT A LAWYER IT IS IN FACT A REMEDY IT IS A REMEDY IS. NOT A VIOLENT REMEDY THAT'S USED BY A LOT OF PEOPLE. RECOVER DAMAGES WHEN THEY'RE NOT. WHEN SOMEONE BREACHES OF CONTRACT IS ESSENTIAL WE'RE TALKING ABOUT I COME I AGREED TO WORK FOR YOU FOR. YOU KNOW AND AGREED PAY. YOU DON'T PAY ME- I'M GONNA GO I AM GOING TO SUE YOU OR USE WHATEVER ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM I CAN'T RECOVER THAT. WAS SEVENTEEN OH ONE WE SAID. I MEAN USUALLY THAT'S THE SUB THAT'S YOUR. SOMETIMES THERE'S BAD ACTORS THERE- AND A SUB MAYBE. DOESN'T PAY LET'S MAKE SURE THAT AT LEAST THE GENERAL. IS GONNA PAY THAT AND MAYBE THE GENERAL DOESN'T EVEN KNOW BUT STILL IT WAS THEIR JOB IT WAS THIS OVERALL PROJECT. SO IT MAKES SENSE TO SAY LOOK YOU MAKE SURE THIS PERSON GETS PAID THEY WORKED ON YOUR JOB. RIGHT HI I'M 1100% OKAY WITH THAT IS WHY SUPPORTERS SEVENTEEN OH ONE. BUT IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. PUNITIVE DAMAGES AND PENALTIES ON TOP OF THAT. TO ME THAT SHOULD BE THE SUB NOT THE GENERAL WHO JUST WHO. IN ALL LIKELIHOOD DIDN'T EVEN KNOW THAT THAT HAPPENED. I THINK WE JUST HAVE A FUNDAMENTAL DISAGREEMENT AND WE'RE JUST GONNA HAVE TO AGREE TO DISAGREE. AND NO I'M NOT AN ATTORNEY NOR DO I THOUGHT I HAD THAT ON TV. MY BAD I WILL. I WAS A LABOR LEADER THIS MONEY IS A. OTHER QUESTIONS ARE COMMON. THIS IS A I FIRST LIKE TO POINT OUT TO BE A LABOR LEADER IN INTERNET OR NOT USUALLY EXCLUSIVE THAT IS TRUE THAT IS VERY TRUE I THINK THERE'S ANOTHER PERSON IN THE SENATE ALSO WHO HAD THOSE DISTINCTIONS- I JUST WANNA THANK YOU FOR THIS BILL OBVIOUSLY IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S NEAR AND DEAR TO MY HEART I ALSO. JUST SO PEOPLE UNDERSTAND. WANT TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE THAT WICKS THAT COMES IN A LOT OF FORM. IT IN AND YES YOU AS A WORKER MAY SAY I DON'T GET A PAYCHECK AND HOW MAY BE VERY OBVIOUS. YOU MAY ALSO- BE IT NOT. BEING GIVEN OVERTIME OR MEAL AND REST BREAKS OR- YOU KNOW ANY FORM OF COMPENSATION. THAT IS OFTEN SKIMMED OFF. THE TOP IN ORDER TO ADD. IN SHORT I GUESS THE SUB CONTRAST MORE PROFITS IN THE WORKER DOESN'T GET WHAT THEY DESERVE. AND ALSO IT'S NOT ALWAYS CLEAR TO THE WORKER THAT THEY'VE BEEN A VICTIM OF WAGE THEFT- AND SOMETIMES EVEN IF IT IS THE WORKER MAY BE SO VULNERABLE. THAT PURSUING A WAGE THEFT CLAIM- FOR VARIETY OF REASONS ISN'T. WITHIN- A REALISTIC YEAH I GUESS REMEDY SO I I'M GLAD THAT YOU'RE DOING THIS I THINK YOU KNOW IT WE HAVE GOT TO STOP. WHICH HAVE TO SPECIALLY IN THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY WHICH IS RAMPANT AND THAT WE KNOW- I AM WHEN THOSE PEOPLE ENAMORED WITH THE IDEA OF MORE MANY CLAIMS TO THE STATE AT. SO YOU KNOW BUT OBVIOUSLY THAT'S THAT'S NOT A DEAL BREAKER FOR ME- I AM GLAD YOU'RE DOING THIS AND WILL CONTINUE TO SUPPORT IT TODAY. AND JUST WHAT ENCOURAGE AT LEAST A DISCUSSION- WITH CBA SO THAT THEY CAN SIT NOT SUGGEST ANYMORE THAT. THERE'S NO DISK I'M SURE YOU WOULD HAVE LOVED TO CBSA ALL THE TIE JUST GOOD GOLLY FOR MYSELF IS HERE CAN TELL YOU THAT SHE EMAILS AND TALK TO THEM ALL THE TIME I HAVE MET WITH THEM. I THINK THAT SOMETIMES OPPOSITION LIKE TO IMPLY ABSOLUTELY I JUST BECAUSE WE DON'T LIKE YOUR AMENDMENT DOESN'T. GIVE YOU AN EXPLANATION AS TO WHY WE DIDN'T LIKE IT AND YOU KNOW THANK YOU FOR SUGGESTING IT BUT NO THANK YOU. WELL I DO AGREE ON THAT THE BUILDERS CAN DO THIS THEY THEY CAN COMPLY WITH THIS LAW THEY DON'T NEED AN ALTERNATIVE BUT- SO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING FORTY. STATE ASSEMBLY MEMBER. RIGHT THANK YOU SENATOR YOU MAY CLOSE I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN EIGHT ON AYE VOTE SO THAT. WORKERS CAN BE TREATED FAIRLY AND THAT WAGE THEFT IS NOT THE COST OF DOING BUSINESS THANK YOU. THANK YOU WE DO HAVE A MOTION TO SECOND THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS CALDWELL PLEASE. STONE AYE STONE AYE GALLAGHER.

GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS THANK YOU WE DO HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND THANK YOU I'M HERE TODAY TO PRESENT SB SIX OH SIX WHICH DIRECTLY ADDRESSES SOME OF THE WORST EMPLOYER ABUSES SEEN DURING THE COPA NINETEEN PANDEMIC. BUT THAT WILL REMAIN UNFORTUNATELY JUST AS IMPORTANT AS A PANDEMIC WINDS DOWN IT WILL CODIFY PARTS OF FEDERAL OSHA POLICY FOR GREGIS VIOLATIONS GIVING KALISTO THE AUTHORITY TO IMPOSE ADDITIONAL PENALTIES ON EMPLOYERS FOR WILLFUL VIOLATIONS WERE WORKERS HAVE BEEN KNOWINGLY HARMED BY IF THEY ARE FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH HEALTH AND SAFETY LAWS. THE BILL THE FEDERAL OSHA'S CORPORATE WIDE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT POLICY BY PROVIDING CAL OSHA THE AUTHORITY TO ISSUE AN ENTERPRISE WIDE CITATION THAT WOULD APPLY TO ALL OCCASIONS UNDER COMMON OWNERSHIP ON AN EMPLOYER'S POLICIES AND PROCEDURES DIRECTLY VIOLATE LABOR AND HEALTH. VIOLATE LABOR HEALTH AND SAFETY STANDARDS AS CHAIR OF THE SENATE SPECIAL COMMITTEE ON PANDEMIC RESPONSE LAST YEAR I HEARD FIRST HAND THE CALL OSHA HAS BEEN INUNDATED WITH MORE COMPLAINTS THAN INSPECTORS CAN HANDLE LEADING STAFF TO RELY INCREASINGLY ON LETTER ONLY INVESTIGATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN INSUFFICIENT. SB SIX A SIX PROVIDES COLOR SHE WITH THE NECESSARY TOOLS TO MAXIMIZE THE USE OF THEIR LIMITED RESOURCES SO THEY'RE ABLE TO RESPOND MORE EFFECTIVELY AND EFFICIENTLY TO HEALTH AND SAFETY VIOLATIONS. TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT TODAY HAVE JUST A GREAT WALL LEGISLATIVE DIRECTOR FOR U. F. C. W. WESTERN STATES COUNCIL AND MITCH SNIDER POLICY ADVOCATE FOR CALIFORNIA. LABOR FEDERATION. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. SO I DO HAVE. TWO WITNESSES LISTED JESSE GRUEL AND MITCH STEIGER BOTH WITH US ON THE TELEPHONE JESSE GROUP. GOOD AFTERNOON TERRY MEMBERS I THINK THAT THE MOST MINUTES BACK AND I'LL MAKE SURE TO KEEP MY COMMENTS BRIEF MY NAME IS JACKIE GRAY WHILE LEGISLATIVE DIRECTOR WITH THE U. S. B. W. WESTERN STATE COUNCIL IF YOU HAVE YOU REPRESENT OVER A HUNDRED EIGHTY THOUSAND WORKERS IN CALIFORNIA ALL OF THEM HAVE BEEN GAME FRONTLINE ESSENTIAL WORKERS THROUGHOUT THIS PANDEMIC. YOUR CONSTITUENTS ARE MEMBERS LED TO THE OCCASION AND CUT THEIR AND THEIR FAMILIES HEALTH AND SAFETY ON THE LINE TO START CALIFORNIANS THROUGHOUT THE PANDEMIC. CURRENT LAW DOES NOT PERMIT CALLOW SAID TO LEVY FINES OR OTHER REMEDIES EVERY STEP INSIDE THE CONSEQUENT SHOULD IT TURNED DEADLY CONDUCT BY LARGE CORPORATIONS AND MAKES ENFORCEMENT NEEDLESSLY DUPLICATIVE AND EXPENSIVE. THIS IS WHY WE NEED SB SIX SX THANK YOU SENATOR GONZALEZ FOR OFFERING THIS IMPORTANT MATTER I THINK EXPENSE EXPENSE ASSEMBLY RACE COLORS THE PENALTY FOR ALL EMPLOYERS IT TAKES A TARGETED APPROACH TO RAISING PENALTIES BUT THE MOST EGREGIOUS AND WHERE YOU CAN THAT WELL FOR VIOLATIONS. SERVING AS A REAL INCENTIVE FOR EMPLOYERS TO VOLUNTARILY COMPLY WITH HEALTH AND SAFETY STANDARDS I DEFINITELY HELLO SIR DOES NOT CURRENTLY HAVE TOOL THAT IS DISPOSABLE THE WHOLE TRAIN COMPANIES ACCOUNTABLE WHEN AN EMPLOYER THREATEN POLICIES OR PROCEDURES ARE IN DIRECT VIOLATION OF HEALTH AND SAFETY ORDERS. AT THE BEGINNING OF THE PANDEMIC WHEN IT WITH CAUTION THAT KILLED NINETEEN COULD BE SPREAD THE AFTER CONTACT CAL OSHA ISSUED INDUSTRY GUIDANCE THAT PROHIBITED WORKERS FROM HANDLING REYES ALL THAT BUT A LARGE CHAIN GROCERY EMPLOYER AND IT'S RIGHT IN POLICIES AND PROCEDURES ASK WORKERS TO CONTINUE TO HANDLE RESULT BACK. AND DIRECT CONTRADICTION OF THE CALLOUS ORDER AND THEIR SITUATION OVER A HUNDRED COMPLAINTS WOULD HAVE BEEN NEEDED TO BE FILED WITH CARLOS AT THE AFRICAN EMPLOYER TO ABATE THE HAZARD WORKPLACE BY WORKPLACE THIS IS NEEDLESSLY DUPLICATIVE AND WORKERS WILL BE WAITING MONTHS IF NOT YEARS UNTIL THEY FIND THE BASEMENT OF THE HOUSE- CONTINUING TO PUT WORKERS HEALTH AND SAFETY AT RISK. SB SIX SX IT'S CRITICAL TO OUR STATE RECOVERY WE MUST SLOW WORKS RIGHT WORKPLACE PRIDE IN PREVENTATIVE SMALL OUTBREAKS IF WE HAVE ANY HOPE OF RETURNING TO NORMAL FOR THESE REASONS WE RESPECTFULLY AFTER I FELL ON SB SIX ATTACKS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND THEN MITCH STAGGER.

THAT WILL STREAMLINE THE OF SETTING EMPLOYER LARGE EMPLOYER THAT ARE BREAKING THE LAW IN MULTIPLE LOCATION AT ONCE BUT WE IT'S A VERY FAIR AND YOU DO WAY OUT FROM PLAYERS. DON'T HAVE A BLANK HEALTH AND SAY POLICY THAT COVERS THE ENTIRE ESTABLISHMENT IT ALSO IT'S NOT WHICH IS THE CATEGORY OF THE EGREGIOUS CITATIONS AND THESE ARE A SUBSET OF WHAT ARE CALLED WILLFUL CITATIONS WHEN AN EMPLOYER IS AWARE THAT THE CONDITION IS HAZARDOUS OR ILLEGAL AND TAKES NO ACTION TO ABATE THAT HAZARD WHEN THERE'S SOME SORT OF AGGRAVATING CIRCUMSTANCE LIKE A BUNCH OF WORKERS GOT HURT OR BUNCH OF WORKERS DIED AS HAS HAPPENED IN OCTOBER NINETEEN. WILL BRING IN THIS CONCEPT OF EGREGIOUS CITATIONS FROM FEDERAL LAW TO- BE USED IN THOSE RARE CASES AND WE DO MEAN VERY RARE- LAST YEAR THERE WERE TWO WILLFUL CITATIONS OF THE YEAR PRIOR TO THAT THERE WERE THREE OF THESE WOULD BE A SUBSET OF THOSE SO THESE ARE GONNA BE EXTRAORDINARILY RARE ONLY USED IN THE WORST OF THE WORST CASES. AND THE LAST THING IS THAT IT CLARIFIES THAT HELLO SIR CAN SITE VIOLATIONS OF THE LABOR CODE RIGHT NOW CALLOUS ONLY SITES TITLE EIGHT REGULATION VIOLATIONS AND SO WHEN THE LEGISLATURE FOR EXAMPLE WANTS TO TAKE ACTION ON A WORKER SAFETY ISSUE THAT. GOES IN THE STATUTE WHICH DOESN'T REALLY LEAVE ANY THERE TO IT AND SO THE PROVISION GIVES LEGISLATURE MORE AUTHORITY OVER THESE OF SAY SO YOU ALL CAN WAY AND WHEN YOU THAT'S A- JUST A QUICK TOUCH ON THE THAT DONE WILL DO TO THE NINETEEN CPAS ABOUT PRESENT OF ATTACK.

THANK YOU WE DO HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND THE MOTION IS DUE PASSED TO APPROPRIATIONS CALL THE ROLL PLEASE. STONE AYE STONE AYE GALLAGHER. GALLAGHER NO CHAU CHIU CHU FIVE DAVIES. GONZALEZ GONZALEZ I HOLDEN HOLDEN I KALRA RIGHT KALRA AYE KILEY MAIENSCHEIN. MAIENSCHEIN HI RES. I THINK THE BILL IS OUT DOUBLES UP THANK YOU SIR. CORRECT WE'LL TAKE UP ITEM NUMBER EIGHTEEN SB TWO EIGHTY EIGHT THE BEEN PULLED OFF OF CONSENT. THANK YOU THE MOTION IS THEIR SECOND. WE DO NOT HAVE A SECOND SENATOR WELL HOPEFULLY BY THE END OF THE PRESENTATION WE WILL SO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY PRESENT. SENATE BILL TWO EIGHTY EIGHT AT TWO THIS MORNING ASSEMBLE TO RADIATE ESTABLISHES A SINGLE STEP CONVERSION PROCESS FOR CALIFORNIA CORPORATIONS TO BECOME FOREIGN CORPORATIONS OR BASICALLY WHAT THAT MEANS IN THIS CONTEXT IS AN OUT OF STATE CORPORATIONS. BUSINESS OWNERS OFTEN DESIRE TO CHANGE THE FORM OF ORGANIZATION OF THEIR BUSINESS OR THE STATE IN WHICH THEIR BUSINESSES FORMED THIS MAY BE NECESSARY FOR EXAMPLE TO RESPOND TO CHANGING ECONOMIC CONDITIONS CHANGES IN THE IN THE BUSINESSES THEY CAN DOCTOR CHANGES IS CHANGES. IN THEIR SHAREHOLDERS PRIORITIES ALL CALIFORNIA PROVIDES A MECHANISM FOR PARTNERSHIPS AND LLCS TO CONVERT FROM ONE TYPE OF AN ENTITY TO ANOTHER IN A SINGLE STEP WE ARE ONE OF THE FEW STATES THAT DOES NOT OFFER SINGLE STEP PROCESS FOR THE CONVERSION OF A CORPORATION. FOR EXAMPLE LET'S SAY A CALIFORNIA CORPORATION DESIRES TO CONVERT INTO A DELAWARE CORPORATION THEY MUST EITHER INCORPORATE AS A NEW CORPORATION IN DELAWARE AND THEN MERGE THE TWO ENTITIES TOGETHER WITH THE DELAWARE CORPORATION SURVIVING THE MERGER AND THE CALIFORNIA CORPORATION CEASING TO EXIST OR- CONVERT INTO ANOTHER TYPE OF CALIFORNIA BUSINESS ENTITY SUCH AS A PARTNERSHIP OR LLC. AND THEN CONVERT THAT INTO T. INTO A DELAWARE CORPORATION MULTISTEP CONVERSIONS ARE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE CUMBERSOME TIME CONSUMING AND EXPENSIVE WELL MAKING IT EASIER FOR BOTH THE BUSINESSES TO INCORPORATE ELSEWHERE MAY SOUND LIKE IT WILL FINAL BUSINESS OUT OF CALIFORNIA WILL ACTUALLY HAVE THE OPPOSITE EFFECT. IF A BUSINESS IS CREATED AND THEY BELIEVE THERE MAY BE A REASON TO INCORPORATE IN ANOTHER STATE ONE DAY THEY'RE LIKELY TO CHOOSE TO INCORPORATE. THERE NOW JUST IN CASE. TO AVOID THE ONEROUS CONVERSION PROCESS OF A CORPORATION IN CALIFORNIA. FIG PARTNERS KNOW THEY COULD UTILIZE A SINGLE STEP FOREIGN CONVERSION PROCESS SHOULD BE NET BECOME NECESSARY ONE DAY IN THE FUTURE. THEY ALWAYS SIGNIFICANTLY MORE LIKELY TO INCORPORATE IN CALIFORNIA. SINCE THE BURDEN OF THE PROCESS TO MOVE THE LOCATION OF THEIR INCORPORATION OUT OF STATE WILL BE MUCH LESS CUMBERSOME AND COSTLY. I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY HERE AND YOU KNOW THAT JUST MEANS IF THEY WANT TO. MOVE THAT THE LOCATION OF THE INCORPORATION NOT THE ACTUAL- PHYSICAL. LOCATION OF THEIR HEADQUARTERS OR WHERE THEY OPERATE. THIS BILL WILL PROVIDE CORPORATIONS WITH SOME FLEXIBILITY AVAILABLE TO CALIFORNIA PARTNERSHIPS AND LLCS AND CORPORATIONS AND OTHER STATES HAVE A PRACTITIONER THERE ARE NONE ON THE CO HOST TELECONFERENCE LINE TO SHARE. HIS REAL WORLD EXPERIENCE AND ANSWER ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS THAT MAY COME UP. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU I DO HAVE THE ONE WITNESS LISTED THERE ARE NONE. PLEASE GOOD MORNING YEAH YES GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS DARREN NINE I AM THE VICE CHAIR OF LEGISLATION OF THE- CORPORATIONS COMMITTEE OF THE BUSINESS LAW SECTION OF THE CALIFORNIA LAWYERS ASSOCIATION. AND THE WAY SUPPORT THIS BILL. THIS BILL WOULD CONFORM THE CONVERSION PROVISIONS OF THE CALIFORNIA CORPORATIONS CODE WITH THE CONVERSION PROVISIONS OF THE CALIFORNIA UNIFORM PARTNERSHIP ACT OF NINETEEN NINETY FOUR. THE CALIFORNIA UNIFORM LIMITED PARTNERSHIP ACT OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHT. AND A CALIFORNIA REVISED UNIFORM LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY AT. ALL THREE OF THE EIGHT STATUTES PROVIDE FOR A SINGLE STEP CONVERSION PROCESS. FOR THOSE ENTITIES TO CONVERT TO AND NOW THEY'RE OUT OF STATE ENTITY. THE CALIFORNIA CORPORATIONS CODE DOES NOT. IT THE IT ALLOWS ONLY THE CONVERSION. OF A CALIFORNIA CORPORATION INTO ANOTHER TYPE OF CALIFORNIA BUSINESS ENTITY SUCH AS A GENERAL OR LIMITED PARTNERSHIP OR LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY. IN THE ABSENCE OF A SINGLE STEP PROCESS AND CALIFORNIA CORPORATION WISHING TO CONVERT INTO A BUSINESS ENTITY ORGANIZED UNDER THE LAWS OF ANOTHER STATE. IS LEFT WITH A TWO STEP PROCESS. WHICH WAS DESCRIBED BY SENATOR JOHNS JUST NOW. THE CALIFORNIA CORPORATION CAN CONVERT INTO ANOTHER TYPE OF BUSINESS ENTITY IT JUST REQUIRES ADDITIONAL HOOPS TO JUMP THROUGH. SB TWO EIGHTY EIGHT WOULD ESTABLISH THE PROCEDURES FOR THE DIRECT CONVERSION OF A DOMESTIC CORPORATION INTO A FOREIGN BUSINESS ENTITY OR QUORUM CORPORATION. MAYES PROCEDURES WITH CLOSELY TRACKED THE PROCEDURES THAT CURRENTLY APPLIED TO THE CONVERSION OF DOMESTIC CORPORATIONS INTO DOMESTIC OTHER BUSINESS ENTITIES. CALIFORNIA LAWYERS ASSOCIATION STRONGLY SUPPORTS THIS BILL AND I WILL STAND BY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT THE MEMBERS MAY HAVE THANK YOU ALL RIGHT THANK YOU. IS THERE ANYONE IN THE HEARING ROOM WHO'D LIKE TO INDICATE SUPPORT FOR SB TWO EIGHTY EIGHT. SEEING NONE THE REMOTE TESTIMONY STATION. SEEING NONE OPERATOR WOULD YOU OPEN THE LINES PLEASE FOR ANYONE WHO'D LIKE TO INDICATE SUPPORT FOR SB TWO EIGHTY EIGHT. YOUR PARENTS PART OF S. B. TWO EIGHTY EIGHT YOU MAY PRESS ONE THEN ZERO. AGAIN THAT'S ONE AND THEN ZERO OF YOUR SUPPORT OF S. B. TWO EIGHT EIGHT. MISTER CHAIR WE HAVE NO SUPPORT QUEUE AT THIS TIME THANK YOU WE WILL MOVE TO OPPOSITION I HAVE NO OPPOSITION LISTED. IS THERE ANYONE IN THE HEARING ROOM WHO'D LIKE TO SPEAK WITH US AND- OF SB TWO EIGHTY EIGHT. SEEING NONE REMOTE TESTIMONY STATION. SEEING NONE OPERATOR JOB ALIGNS FOR ANY OPPOSITION TO SB TWO EIGHTY EIGHT. THANK YOU FOR IN UP IN OPPOSITION OF S. B. TWO EIGHT EIGHT YOU MAY PRESS ONE THEN ZERO. AGAIN THAT'S ONE AND THEN THEIR OWN FEAR IN OPPOSITION OF SB. TWO EIGHT EIGHT. WE HAVE NOT BUSINESS THANK YOU AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU OPERATOR YOU MAY CLOSE THE LINES WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE THIS GONZALEZ. AND AT THANK YOU FOR REACHING OUT WHEN I PUT UP CONSENT WONDERING- WHAT INFORMATION WERE RELYING ON TO YOU KNOW STUDIES ARE. SURVEYS THAT BUSINESSES CHOOSE NOT TO INCORPORATE IN CALIFORNIA BECAUSE OF THIS- TWO STEP PROCESS. THAT'S A VERY GOOD QUESTION AND I THINK I'LL WOULD DEFER THAT TO MR DONE. YES THANK YOU VERY BIG CALIFORNIA LAWYERS ASSOCIATION WHICH IS THE- SPONSOR OF THIS BILL. AND ANY ENTITY THAT I SERVE AS VICE CHAIR OF LEGISLATION IS COMPRISED OF CALIFORNIA AND CORPORATE. TENSIONERS AND IT THE- THE SOURCE OF THE BILL IS BASED UPON OUR CUMULATIVE EXPERIENCE WORKING WITH. ENTREPRENEURS IN CALIFORNIA IN ADVISING THEM AS WELL AS INVESTORS AND OTHER PARTICIPANTS IN THE MARKET WITH RESPECT TO STARTING CORPORATIONS AND OTHER BUSINESS ENTITIES IN CALIFORNIA AND ELSEWHERE. AND THIS ISSUE COMES UP- ALL THE TIME WHEN ENTREPRENEURS ARE IN. BECAUSE IN THE START A NEW BUSINESS THEY WILL ASK THEIR ADVISERS THEIR LEGAL ADVISORS WHERE THEY OUGHT TO INCORPORATE. AND THE AND THAT THE LEGAL ADVISERS HAVE TO GIVE THEM PROS AND CONS OF STARTING IN CALIFORNIA OR STARTING IN ANOTHER JURISDICTION. AS SENATOR JONES- MANSION INCORPORATING IN ANOTHER JURISDICTION DOESN'T MEAN THAT THAT THAT THE BUSINESS IS LOCATED IN THAT IN THAT OTHER JURISDICTION IT JUST MEANS THAT THE CORPORATIONS. I'M LEGAL STRUCTURE IS BASED ON THE LAWS OF THAT OTHER JURISDICTION. AND WIN IT PRACTITIONERS ADVISING US OR I COULD GO AHEAD WITH THERE WAS ACTUALLY A DIRECT QUESTION THERE AND YOU'RE NOT ACTUALLY ANSWERING THE QUESTION THE QUESTION WAS WHETHER OR NOT THERE WERE STUDIES OR DATA. THAT THAT SHOW THE PROBLEMS SO OPEN LIKE TO MAKE SURE THAT STATE STICKING TO THE ANSWER TO THE QUESTION PLEASE. YES I'M SORRY I WAS ATTEMPTING TO THE STATE THAT THE- THAT THERE THERE AREN'T ANY STUDIES. THAT ARE THE FOUNDATION OF THIS BILL IT'S RATHER THEIR CUMULATIVE EXPERIENCE OF THE PRACTITIONERS IN. THE CALIFORNIA LAWYERS. ASSOCIATION OKAY THANK YOU. AND I THOUGHT THAT THAT WAS THE CASE BUT I DID WANT TO GET ANSWERED ON OPPORTUNITY THERE WAS A SHARE TICKER STUDY THAT YOU CAN I THINK I AM SORRY I CAN'T FIND IT RIGHT NOW I READ THAT THAT CALIFORNIA'S PREFERABLE BECAUSE IT IS CHEAPER THAN A NUMBER OF. STATES TO FORM CORPORATION AIRCRAFT THAT IS YES SO YOU KNOW I JUST HAVE TO SAY. AND I UNDERSTAND ON. IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT IF A CALIFORNIA CORPORATION SOMEHOW STREAMLINED TO WANT TO BECOME A DELAWARE CORPORATION THAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY LEAVING EVERYTHING IS RIGHT I JUST CAN'T I CAN'T BRING MYSELF. CREATING AN AVENUE BY WHICH WE ALREADY HAVE LOWER FEES TO INCORPORATE HERE TO THEN- STREAMLINED TO MOVE. THE CORPORATION HEADQUARTERS TO ANOTHER STATE WHICH BECOMES A TALKING POINT QUITE FRANKLY- AGAINST A LOT OF STUFF THAT HAPPENS CALIFORNIANS SO ALTHOUGH WE'RE GOING INTO DETAIL HERE I FEEL MUCH MORE COMFORTABLE IF THERE WAS. ONE AVAILABLE DATA- THAT SAID YOU KNOW THIS MANY CORPORATIONS DON'T INCORPORATE CALIFORNIA IT SOUNDS TO ME LIKE WE'RE JUST TRYING TO GIVE ANOTHER GIFT TO CORPORATIONS TO LEAVE THE STATE SO I CAN'T SUPPORT THIS I'M SORRY ONE ONE RESPONSE TO THAT IN IN THAT CERTAINLY AND- LEGITIMATE CONCERN ONE OF THE- SO THE IMPETUS OF THE BILL IS. PARTLY WHAT MR DONE ALREADY SHARED AND THEN SECONDLY TO THAT AND I THINK JUST AS AS IMPORTANT MAYBE- YOU KNOW MORE REASON HOW THE BILLS WE ARE THE PROCESS THAT WE'RE SETTING UP FOR CORPORATIONS TODAY WITH THIS BILL. WE ALREADY DO FOR PARTNERSHIPS AND LIMITED LIABILITY CORPORATION SO JUST KINDA- CLARIFYING THINGS SO IT. MAKES SENSE ACROSS THE BOARD FOR ALL TYPES OF. CORORATE STRUCTURES I APPRECIATE THAT AND PERHAPS IF I HADN'T BEEN AN UNDATED WITH- INUNDATED WITH- TALKING POINTS- OVER THE LAST EIGHT YEARS THAT WE'VE SERVED TOGETHER OFF AND ON ABOUT WHAT WE'RE DOING TO CALIFORNIA CORPORATIONS I MIGHT BE MORE OPEN TO SUGGESTING STREAMLINING THE MOVING OUT OF CALIFORNIA BUT I DON'T THINK I'M READY TO DO THAT TODAY OKAY PERSONALLY. THANK YOU THIS MAIENSCHEIN YEAH COUPLE COMMENTS- AND A QUESTION. FIRST UP TO SOME EXOTIC THIS IT APPEARS AT LEAST TO BE KIND OF A- SOLUTION LOOKING FOR A PROBLEM. THERE'S NO- STUDIES THAT SHOW THAT THIS IS AN ISSUE INTERESTINGLY THE ONLY. SUPPORT I SEE FOR THIS IS- A DIVISION OF THE CALIFORNIA LAWYERS ASSOCIATION THERE'S NO BUSINESS GROUPS WHO WERE- SAYING THIS IS AN ISSUE I CERTAINLY HAVE BEEN CONSULTED BY ANY. BUSINESSES WHO. I SAID THIS IS A PROBLEM OR THEY WON'T INCORPORATING CALIFORNIA. BECAUSE UNDER. A CERTAIN OPERATING STATUS THEY COULDN'T SOMETIME IN THE FUTURE SWITCH- I AM SURPRISED THAT THIS IS EVEN PROCEEDED TO THIS POINT WITHOUT ANY SORT OF. REALLY FACTUAL BASIS TO SUPPORT IT- AND ALSO TO I. AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUE SAID- YOU KNOW. IT IT'S A- HARD POSITION IN MY OPINION TO BE TRYING TO MAKE IT SIMPLER FOR A CORPORATION TO LEAVE CALIFORNIA- IN ADDITION WHAT IS THE FEE. THAT THEY WOULD BE SAVING. WELL I THINK THAT DEPENDS ON IF THERE'S A SPECIFIC NUMBER THAT I YES TO ME BASED ON HOW HOW LONG THE TOURNEY TAKES TO DO THE PAPERWORK TO WHATEVER OTHER JURISDICTION THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE MISTER DUNN HAS A PARTICULAR ANSWER FOR THAT I'LL ACTUALLY AND ASK WHAT'S WHAT HOW MUCH IS THE- COST. OF THE FORM. HELLO MR DONE. T. SHIRT THAT. YOU'RE SO YOU'RE NOT YOU DON'T. RIGHT I DON'T KNOW IT IS N. AS IN IS IT SPEAKING TO THE CONCERNS ABOUT. YOU KNOW THE SUPPORT FROM CORPORATIONS AND SUCH YOU ARE CORRECT IT HAS KIND OF MOVED THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE LEGISLATURE- FAIRLY SIMPLY BECAUSE I THINK MOST- WOULD AND I DON'T KNOW IF THIS MAKES A DIFFERENCE OR NOT CENTER MEN IS A IS A CO AUTHOR- YOU KNOW SAW THE BENEFIT OF THIS FOR THE CORPORATIONS. IN HIS AREA- WHEN WE STARTED THE BILL AS FAR AS SPECIFICALLY ANSWER YOUR BILL IN THE DOLLAR AMOUNT I'LL SEE IF- MISTER DUNN HAS AN ANSWER FOR THAT MR NINETY TO. GIVE AN ANSWER THE QUESTION. JUST THE UP THE FEES ONE LET. ME YEAH THE FILING FEE IS NOMINAL M. I DON'T KNOW THE NUMBER BUT TYPICALLY FIFTY HUNDRED DOLLARS BUT THAT'S NOT WHERE THE COST SAVINGS COMES FROM THE COST SAVINGS RESULTS FROM. THE CORPORATE. INCORPORATING IN ANOTHER STATE AND BEING SUBJECT TO THE FRANCHISE TAX. PROVISIONS OF THAT OTHER STATE THAT'S WHAT MAKES INCORPORATING CALIFORNIA LESS EXPENSIVE. OKAY SO EVEN THOUGH IT. I DIDN'T GET AN ANSWER ON THE COSTS THE FORM I BELIEVE THE CASA FROM SOMEWHERE AROUND A HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS OKAY SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A HUNDRED. AND FIFTY DOLLAR SAVINGS TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR A COMPANY TECH COMPANY AT A CERTAIN FORM OF INCORPORATE COMPANY TO DO THIS I WOULD ALSO AS AN ATTORNEY ACTUALLY DID IN PREPARATIONS IT'S A IT'S REALLY A ESPECIALLY FOR SOMEBODY WHO'S DOING THEM ALL THE TIME IT'S A VERY MINIMAL AMOUNT OF TIME FOR A LAWYER WHO'S DOING THEM AT CENTER IT'S A VERY SIMPLE. PROCESS WHICH BY THE WAY HAS GOTTEN SIMPLER OVER TIME IS NOW YOU CAN DO IT ONLINE IT YOU KNOW THERE'S A STANDARD FORM THAT YOU THAT YOU USE SO THE AMOUNT OF TIME FOR A LAWYER TO DO THIS WOULD. YOU KNOW NOT EVEN TOTAL AN HOUR EARLY. TO DO THAT SO- I- I WILL SAY I WILL BE. OPPOSING THE BILL TODAY. I DON'T SUPPORT. I MADE IT LAYING OUT THE RED CARPET FOR. CERTAIN CORPORATE ENTITIES TO LEAVE THE STATE I THINK I THINK WE NEED TO BE DOING WHAT WE CAN TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE MAKING. AND IT IT- ATTRACTIVE FOR- THESE THESE BUSINESSES THE SAME CALIFORNIA- AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT JUST ADD AN ANECDOTAL. NO STUDIES NO FAX NO BUSINESS GROUPS EVEN IN SUPPORT OF THE US- IT'S NOT SOMETHING I CAN SUPPORT TODAY. THANK YOU THIS GALLAGHER. YEAH MISTER CHAIRMAN I THINK THERE'S A MISUNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THIS BILL IS ABOUT IT'S NOT ABOUT CORPORATIONS LEAVING CALIFORNIA THERE ARE MANY CORPORATIONS THAT YOU WOULD THINK OF IS CALIFORNIA BASED BUSINESSES WHO ARE INCORPORATED IN ANOTHER STATE. THIS IS ALL ABOUT INCORPORATION NOT ABOUT WHERE THE BUSINESS IS LOCATED WE ALREADY DO THIS AND IT'S VERY SIMPLE YOU WRITE IS A VERY SIMPLE PROCESS AND WE MADE IT VERY EASY FOR A PARTNERSHIP FOR EXAMPLE TO CONVERT. TO A FOREIGN PARTNERSHIP OR TO OR FOR AN LLC TO CONVERT TO A FOREIGN LLC THIS IS JUST SAYING DO THE SAME THING FOR CORPORATIONS- IT'S NOT ABOUT LEADING GOING TO SOME OTHER STATES ABOUT INCORPORATING- AND IF WE'RE GOING TO USE AS THE BASIS THAT WE NEED TO HAVE ALL THIS DATA. TO SUPPORT A BILL PASSING OUT MAN THERE'S A LOT OF BILLS THAT SHOULD NEVER GET OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE- AND SHOULD NEVER GET OFF OF THE ASSEMBLY FLOOR- FOR THAT MATTER BUT OBVIOUSLY WE HAVE PRACTITIONERS THE PEOPLE WHO PRACTICE CORPORATE LAW- AND WHO OF WHO ARE SO ACTIVE IN IT THAT THEY'VE JOINED THE BUSINESS LAW SECTION. AND GOT TOGETHER AND SAID THIS THIS WAS AN ISSUE FOR THEIR CLIENTS THAT SEEMS TO BE PRETTY SUFFICIENT DATA FACTORS COMMITTEE PASSES A LOT OF BILLS THAT ARE BROUGHT TO US BY THE LAWYERS ASSOCIATION- AND MANY TIMES THERE ON CONSENT- BECAUSE ARE THE PRACTITIONERS ARE COMING TO US WITH THE PROBLEM THAT THEY'RE SEEN- IN THE PRACTICE OF LAW SO. I'M GONNA SUPPORT THE BILL I THINK IT'S A VERY YOU KNOW SIMPLE COMMONSENSE CHANGE THAT WE ALREADY DO FOR OTHER BUSINESSES IN THE STATE- DOESN'T ENCOURAGE THEM TO GO SOMEWHERE ELSE IT'S JUST ABOUT WHERE THEY'RE LEGALLY INCORPORATED- AND SO I WILL BE SUPPORT TODAY. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN. THANK YOU. THE QUESTIONS ARE. RIGHT SEEING NONE OF YOUR BILL HAS A MOTION BUT NOT A SECOND SO WILL NOT BE ABLE TO TAKE A VOTE ON IT UNTIL WE CAN- WE'LL SEE ONCE WE GET THE FULL COMMITTEE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR PATIENT THAT NOW LOOKS UP TO MR GALLAGHER'S COMMENTS AS THE CLOTHES BECAUSE HE DOING GREAT JOB THANK YOU ALL RIGHT.

IN OUR NATION'S CAPITAL AND STATE HOUSES ALL OVER THE COUNTRY AND THAT WE SHOULD FURTHER BE THOUGHTFUL AND DELIBERATE. AND I BELIEVE UTILIZING THE LAW REVIEW COMMISSION- TO INFORM US AND I SHOULD ALSO NOTE. THERE IS AN OPPOSITION WATER YOU MAY HAVE SEEN OR HAD A CHANCE TO REVIEW- THE CALIFORNIA LAW OR- LAW REVIEW COMMISSION'S PROCESS IS AN OPEN PROCESS THAT CAN TAKE INPUT FROM THE PUBLIC. THEY CAN TAKE INPUT FROM STAKEHOLDERS. THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE PROCESS SO THERE WILL BE PLENTY OF OPPORTUNITY FOR THOSE THAT WOULD LIKE THE CARD READ ACT TO REMAIN AS CURRENTLY WRITTEN AND NOT BE CHANGED.

SPEAKING OF THE DEVIL. THANK YOU SENATOR BRADFORD. WE DEFINITELY WANT TO TAKE UP. ITEM NUMBER. THIRTEEN SB TWO SINCE THIS IS ONE BILL THAT NEEDS TO BE- FROM COMMITTEE TODAY SO SENATOR WELCOME THANK YOU FOR. YOUR LOTUS THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I APPRECIATE YOUR INDULGENCE HEARING THIS IMPORTANT MATTER- STATED THIS IS SB TWO TO. REMAKE OF WHAT WE TRIED TO DO LAST YEAR- SB SEVEN THREE ONE- THIS YEAR IT'S BETTER KNOWN AS THE KENNETH ROSS JUNOR POLICE TO CERTIFICATION. BILL KENNETH ROSS JUNIOR WAS A TWENTY FIVE YEAR OLD YOUNG MAN WHO LIVED IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD WHO WAS SHOT IN THE BACK TWICE. BY A OFFICER WHO HAD TRANSFERRED TO GARDENA POLICE DEPARTMENT AFTER HAVING THREE OTHER QUESTIONABLE SHOULD THE SHOOTINGS AND ORANGE COUNTY AND WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO WITH THIS MEASURE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE IN. THE WASH RINSE AND REPEAT CYCLE OF SOME OF THESE BAD OFFICERS- THAT WE KNOW ALL EXIST. HERE IN CALIFORNIA ACROSS THIS COUNTRY- THIS MEASURE IS CO AUTHORED A MY JOIN AUTHOR I'M- PROUD TO SAY IS. PROTIUM TONI ATKINS AND- IT'S A PRIORITY FOR THE LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS. SO AGAIN I APPRECIATE HEARING THIS THING BILL THOSE. TWO VERY SIMPLE THINGS THE GREAT TO STATEWIDE PROCESS TO REVOKE THE CERTIFICATION OF AN OFFICER. AFTER THE CONVICTION OF A SERIOUS CRIME OR TERMINATION FROM EMPLOYMENT DUE TO MISCONDUCT. WE'RE NOW ONE OF ONLY FOUR STATES IT DOESN'T HAVE A FAIR TRANSPARENT. AND OPEN AND ON. A MATTER OF GETTING RID OF BAD OFFICERS ARE BY DECERTIFYING THEM AND- WE LEAD IN THE ENVIRONMENT WE LEAD IN THEIR KANEMI WE LEAD IN TECHNOLOGY BUT- WE- TRAIL- MS. BEHIND THESE OTHER FORTY SIX STATES WHEN IT COMES TO REAL PLEASED TO FOR OUR REFORM INDIE CERTIFICATION. HE CALIFORNIA CURRENTLY NOW IS ABLE TO REVOKE THE LICENSE OF A DOCTOR OF A BAD DOCTOR ABOUT LAWYER. BAD BARBER COSMETOLOGIST IT SHOULDN'T BE EASIER TO REVOKE A BEAUTICIAN'S LICENSE OR BARBERS LICENSE FOR A BAD HAIR CUT BUT UNABLE TO DECERTIFY A POLICE OFFICER WHO IS BROKEN A LAW. AND VIOLATED THE TRUST OF OUR PUBLIC THIS BILL WOULD CREATE A FAIR AND EFFECTIVE PROCESS TO ENSURE THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS WHO BREAK PUBLIC TRUST ARE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR ACTIONS AND NOT ALLOWED TO SIMPLY MOVE ON TO ANOTHER DEPARTMENT WHICH WE ALL KNOW THAT EXIST IN THE EXAMPLE THAT I GAVE- WOOD MISTER ROSS IS ONE OF THOSE EXAMPLES OF- A OFFICER LEAVING ONE DEPARTMENT ONLY TO COME TO ANOTHER ONE. AND REALLY MOST OF THESE BAD OFFICERS ARE QUESTIONABLE OFFICERS WIND UP IN THE SMALLER COMMUNITIES THESE. CITIES THAT CAN AFFORD THE TRAINING AND- ACADEMY SO THESE OFFICERS HAVE BEEN TRAINED IN THESE COME FROM THESE BIGGER METROPOLITAN AREAS THE SMALL TOWNS WELCOME THEM WITH OPEN ARMS DESPITE THEIR CHECKERED PAST SO THIS WILL. IN THAT. IT THIS BILL. ALL WELL ALLOWS THE COMMISSION. ON PEACE OFFICER STANDARDS AND TRAINING. BETTER KNOWN AS A POST. AND A COMMISSION THAT IS MADE UP PRIMARILY OF LAW ENFORCEMENT TO INVESTIGATE THEIR GROUNDS FOR OFFICERS MISCONDUCT. THIS AT THE ALREADY IS IMPORTANT IN ENSURING THAT WE ARE CREATING AN EFFECTIVE DE CERTIFICATION SYSTEM. IT WOULD ALSO CREATE AN ADVISORY BOARD WITH IN POLLS THAT WOULD MAKE INITIAL RECOMMENDATIONS ON WHETHER POLL SHOULD DECERTIFY AN OFFICER. FINALLY THIS BILL ALLOWS THE COMMISSION TO DEFINE BY REGULATION THE SPECIFIC GROUNDS OF SERIOUS CAUGHT MISCONDUCT. THAT WOULD BE CONSIDERED FOR DECERTIFICATION SEVERAL THESE AGREE JUST BACKGROUNDS ARE LAID OUT IN THIS BILL SUCH AS SEXUAL ASSAULT DISHONESTY AND ABUSE OF POWER AMONG OTHERS ALSO MADE THE COMMISSION HAS THE AUTHORITY. AND DEFINING WHAT EXACTLY MISCONDUCT IS THAT CAN LEAD TO DO CERTIFICATION OF OFFICE. WE FEEL THIS IS A FAIR APPROACH AND IT'S NOT RADICAL BY ANY STRETCH OF IMAGINATION AND IT'S CURRENTLY WHAT MANY OTHER STATES AS I STATED ARE DOING RIGHT NOW. AND THE MORE RELEVANT TO THIS COMMITTEE THIS BILL MAKES CHANGES TO STRENGTHEN- THE THOMAS BAYNE CIVIL RIGHTS ACT. IT ENSURES THAT A FAMILY MEMBER OF A PERSON KILLED BY LAW ENFORCEMENT IS ALSO ABLE TO ASSERT BECAUSE OF ACTION UNDER THE BAN ACT IT CLARIFIES THAT THREE OF THE MOST EGREGIOUS COMMUNITIES CALMLY ASSERTED BY LAW ENFORCEMENT OR NOT OPTICAL. TO CLAIMS BROUGHT UNDER THE PLANE ACT. FOLLOWING THIS BILL BEING HEARD AND SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE WE HEARD CONCERNS FROM MANY MEMBERS OF THE SENATE REGARDING THIS SECTION OF THE BILL. WE ARE WE'RE CONCERNED THAT THIS BILL WOULD OPEN UP A FLOODGATE OF A LIABILITIES. AND POSE A SERIOUS FINANCIAL TOLL ON LOCAL. GOVERNMENTS THIS IS WHAT MANY MEMBERS FOUGHT WERE ABLE TO pMEMBERS AND THE LEADERSHIP AND OUR HOUSE TO LIMIT THE WRONGFUL DEATH CLAIMS THAT CAN BE BROUGHT UNDERTHE BANE ACT. TO THE MOST SERIOUS OFFENSES THIS AGREEMENT READ THAT A PERSON WOULD ONLY BE ABLE TO BRING A CAUSE OF ACTION IF THE CONDUCT. ON WHICH THE CLAIM IS BASED CONSTITUTES A CRIME OF VIOLENCE OR CRIME OF MORAL TURPITUDE. WE MADE A COMMITMENT TO MEMBERS OF OUR HOUSE THAT ANY AMENDMENTS MADE TO THIS PIECE OF THE BILL WOULD BE SOLELY. TO CLARIFY THE LANGUAGE WE DRAFTED BUT WE WOULD NOT UNDO. THE INTENT OF OUR AGREEMENTS. AS POINTED OUT IN OUR ANALYSIS IS LANGUAGE IS UNCLEAR IMPOSES MAJOR ISSUES AS CURRENTLY DRAFTED. WE HAVE SEVERAL CONVERT WE'VE HAD SEVERAL CONVERSATIONS WITH CHEERING COMMITTEE STAFF AND I APPRECIATE THAT BUT WE WERE UNABLE TO COME TO THE LANGUAGE THAT WOULD MAKE THIS CLEAR WHILE TO SAME TIME KEEPING OUR COMMITMENT TO THE MEMBERS OF OUR HOUSE I WANT TO THANK YOU CHEERING THIS COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR WORK ON THIS BILL WE RECOGNIZE THAT. THERE'S MUCH WORK TO BE DONE IN GOOD FAITH AND I STAND HERE- WITH THE DESIRE TO MAKE THIS BILLS AS STRONG AS POSSIBLE AND- AND IT'S FAIR AND TRANSPARENT AS POSSIBLE ON IT APRIL UNFORTUNATE I'M UNABLE. TO TAKE- WELL WHEN I GO TO FIND THAT SOLUTION AS WE STAND HERE TODAY THAT BEING SAID I'M MAKING A COMMITMENT TODAY TO REMOVE THE SECTION RELATED TO WRONGFUL DEATH CLAIMS. AS AUTHOR MA'AM IT'S GOING TO ASSEMBLY PUBLIC SAFETY BUT I REMAIN COMMITTED TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THIS COMMITTEE IN THE COMING DAYS TO FIND A SOLUTION ON THIS ISSUE WE ALL RECOGNIZE THAT IT IS IMPORTANT ISSUE AND CALIFORNIANS WHO HAVE LOST LOVED ONES DUE TO POLICE MISCONDUCT DESERVE A REMEDY. IN ADDITION TO REMOVING THE PROVISION ON WRONGFUL DEATH CLAIMS WE WILL ALSO BE AMENDING THE DECERTIFICATION PORTION OF THE BILL FOLLOWING A LENGTHY DISCUSSION WITH THE GOVERNOR'S ADMINISTRATION POST AND THE RELEVANT STAKEHOLDERS. WE FEEL COMFORTABLE THAT THESE AMENDMENTS ADDRESS VARIOUS. IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES AND THESE WILL BE MADE PUBLIC IN THE COMING DAYS. AND WE'RE CONTINUE TO WORK ON THE BILL WITH THIS ADMINISTRATION THE COMMITTEE STAFF INCLUDING AGAIN ASSEMBLY JUDICIARY'S ASSEMBLY PUBLIC SAFETY. AND APPROPRIATIONS AND ALL COMMITTED STAKEHOLDERS THIS BILL IS A PRIORITY AGAIN AT FOR THE LEGISLATIVE BLOCK CONSTRUCT. A CAUCUS. SPONSORED BY THE COMMUNITY GRASSROOTS ORGANIZATION PORTED BY THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS WERE LOOKING FOR US TO PASS MEANINGFUL. POLICE REFORM. TESTIFIED TODAY AND SUPPORT THIS MACHITO. MONTERROSA SISTER SEAN MONTERROSA AND MEMBERS OF CRIME SURVIVORS FOR SAFETY AND JUSTICE. CARL DOUGLAS. BOARD MEMBER OF CONSUMER ATTORNEYS OF CALIFORNIA AND WE ALSO WOULD HAVE. JULIE JULIA ARE YOU PRESIDENT OF THE NATIONAL POLICE ACCOUNTABILITY PROJECT UNVEILED ANSWER ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS. AND MEMBERS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE THANK YOU IN CENTER JUST A NOTE ON THE AMENDMENTS EVEN THOUGH THE IT. THE ANALYSIS DOES LIST AMENDMENTS WE'VE BEEN WORKING PRETTY CLOSELY VERY CLOSELY WITH THE CENTER'S OFFICE WHICH WE APPRECIATE. WITH THE SENATE PRO TEM'S OFFICE WE ARE NOT ASKING FOR THOSE OF THEM IT'S AT THIS TIME BUT I DO APPRECIATE YOUR COMMITMENT. TO DEAL WITH THE WRONGFUL DEATH. AS WE MOVE AS AS WE HAVE AGREED SO. THAT PART OF THE ANALYSIS WE ARE NOT JUST FOR MEMBERS WE ARE NOT ASKING FOR THOSE OF THEM IT'S AT THAT POINT AT THIS POINT AND THAT IS FINE. WITH WITH ME ALL RIGHT THANKS A WE WILL MOVE TO. THE WITNESSES IN SUPPORT CARL DOUGLAS AND MICHELLE MONTERROSA. NOTING THAT JULIA YOU IS AVAILABLE ON THE TELEPHONE FOR. QUESTIONS AND MICHELLE MONTERROSA YOU'RE HERE IN PERSON WELCOME. GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I'M HERE TODAY IN SUPPORT OF S. B. TWO TWO TWO WHICH WOULD CREATE A MECHANISM FOR DECERTIFYING OFFICERS WHO ARE UNFIT TO WEAR A BADGE I'M MICHELLE MONTERROSA THE SURVIVING SISTER OF MY BROTHER SEAN WITH THAT ASA WHAT OUR FAMILY HAS BEEN PUT THROUGH BY THE VALLEJO POLICE DEPARTMENT WOULD BE MORE THAN THE TIME THAT I HAVE HERE TODAY BUT I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THE WAY IT ILLUSTRATES THE NEED FOR SB TWO. ON JUNE SECOND OF TWENTY TWENTY SEAN WAS NEARLY WHAT IS HANDS UP WHEN OFFICER GERAKAN OF THE VALLEJO POLICE DEPARTMENT SHOT THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD BUT UNMARKED PICKUP TRUCK. WITH AN A. R. FIFTEEN. POLICE ARE THE ONLY LICENSED PROFESSIONALS ARE CURRENTLY CANNOT BE DECERTIFIED FOR UNETHICAL AND HARMFUL ACTIONS. VIRTUALLY EVERYONE ELSE FROM BARBERS TO LAWYERS. WILL LOSE THEIR LICENSE IF THEY VIOLATE THE TRUST PLACED IN THEM BY THE STATE. THIS IS ALSO A PERSONAL ISSUE FOR ME. AS IT IS FOR MANY OF THE FAMILIES WHO LOST A LOVED ONE TO POLICE VIOLENCE. YEAH CALIFORNIA IS ONLY ONE OF FOUR STATES THAT HAS NO PROCESS TO DECERTIFY COPS WHO ABUSE THAT POWER. AND COMMIT SERIOUS MISCONDUCT. THE OFFICER WHO MURDERED SEAN. JERIT TIME HAS BEEN INVOLVED IN FOUR OTHER SHOOTINGS IN THE FOUGHT PAST FIVE YEARS. BEFORE TRANSFERRING TO THE VALLEJO POLICE DEPARTMENT OFFICER TIME WORK FOR THE GALT PD WHERE HE WAS INVOLVED IN AT LEAST ONE OFFICER INVOLVED SHOOTING THAT WE KNOW WORK. IMMEDIATELY AFTER SHAUN WAS SHOT. OFFICER TIME CAN BE HEARD IN THE FOOTAGE THANK I DIDN'T NEED THIS TODAY. TO WHICH A SENIOR COMMANDING OFFICER REPLIED IT'S OKAY WE'VE BEEN THROUGH THIS BEFORE. AFTER SHAWN'S DEATH THE PRESIDENT OF THE VALLEJO POLICE UNION ORDERED THE DESTRUCTION OF EVIDENCE AND MY BROTHER'S CASE BEFORE AN INVESTIGATION COULD BE CONDUCTED. IT'S ALSO COME TO LIGHT THE VALLEJO'S POLICE DEPARTMENTS ONE OF THE MOST VIOLENT IN THE COUNTRY. WE'VE ALSO LEARNED THAT POLICE SYMBOL AEL FENDER BADGES TO MARK HOW MANY POT PEOPLE THEY'VE KILLED. THIS IS IN NO WAY AN ISOLATED CASE. THERE ARE MANY OTHER FAMILIES NOT JUST THEM BUT LEYVA BUT ACROSS ALL OF CALIFORNIA WHO HAVE SIMILAR STORIES. ABOUT THE WAYS THAT THE POLICE HAVE SWEPT THE DEATHS OF THEIR LOVED ONES UNDER THE RUG. SIMPLY PUT THE POLICE ARE NOT ABLE TO POLICE THEMSELVES. SB TWO ALLOWS POST TO CONDUCT INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATIONS WILL LOCAL AGENCIES DESTROY OR SUPPRESS EVIDENCE LIKE THE VALLEJO POLICE DEPARTMENT DID IN MY BROTHER'S CASE. WE ALL DESERVE TO LIVE IN COMMUNITIES WHERE WE FEEL SAFE AND PROTECTED. AND OVER THE PAST YEAR IT'S MADE MAKE IT'S BEEN MADE CLEAR THAT NOT EVERYONE HAS THAT PRIVILEGE. FURTHERMORE IT IS LONG OVERDUE FOR CALIFORNIA TO JOIN THE REST OF THE U. S. WITH THE ABILITY TO REMOVE OFFICERS WHO SHOULD HAVE NO LONGER BEEN. IN LAW ENFORCEMENT AND REMOVE THEM FROM OUR STREETS. I ASK YOU RESPECTFULLY TO PLEASE VOTE YES. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. AND THEN CARL DOUGLAS WHO'S WITH US ON THE TELEPHONE. THANK YOU SO MUCHCHAIRMAN STONE AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. MY NAME IS CARL DOUGLAS AND FOR FORTY TWO YEARS I HAVE TOILED IN THE STREETS AS A CIVIL RIGHTS LAWYER. THIS BILL IS PARTICULARLY MEANINGFUL FOR ME CHAIRMEN STONE AND TELL YOU WHY. BECAUSE MY OFFICE AT DOUGLAS TAKE LAW REPRESENTS THE SEVEN YEAR OLD SON OF KENNETH ROSS JUNIOR. WE WERE FORCED TO FILE OUR ACTION IN FEDERAL COURT. BECAUSE BASED ON WHAT I THINK IS A ROGUE INTERPRETATION OF THE LAW. MISTER ROGERS SEVEN YEAR OLD SON WAS PREVENTED FROM SEEKING JUSTICE AND THE STATE COURT OF CALIFORNIA. IT IS MY HOPE THAT WITH CONTINUED EFFORTS OF MY NEW HE WROTE SENATOR BRADFORD. SB TWO WILL CHANGE THAT. OKAY IN FORTY TWO YEARS I'VE SEEN THE ABSENT AND THE FLOWS OF THE LAW. IN MY MIND IT MAKES NO LOGICAL OR LEGAL SENT. THAT THE MAN THAT SHOT MISTER ROSS. HE COULD- IF MISTER ROSS HAD BEEN PARALYZED WHEN HE WAS LAYING AND WRITHING IN PAIN ON THE GROUNDS OF RALEIGH PARK I'VE SEEN THE VIDEO OF THAT SHOOTING. IT'S IRONIC THAT WHILE MR ROSS COULD. HAVE SUED WHERE HE PARALYZED HIS SON. IS A PREVENTIVE STILL BECAUSE POLICE OFFICER WAS A SHE- AND KILLED HIM. I SEEN DEVELOP IN COURTS OF TO ME. WE HAD TO FILE IN A BROAD THE THIRD CASE IN FEDERAL COURT. IT IS COMPLICATED BY THIS PROCESS CALLED QUALIFIED IMMUNITY. BOTH QUALIFIED IMMUNITY IS A COMPLICATED CONCEPT ABOUT CLEARLY ESTABLISHED LAWS AND I DARE SAY THOUGH I HAVE BEEN IN THIS FIGHT FOR FORTY TWO YEARS I AM I'M ABLE TO PROVIDE A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT QUALIFIED IMMUNITY MEANS. THAT IS A PROBLEM GIVEN WHAT I'VE NOW LEARNING ARE THE ADJUSTMENTS THAT ARE BEING CONSIDERED NOW. GIVEN THE WITHDRAWAL OF THE AMENDMENT FOR THE NECESSARY CHANGES TO THE BRAIN ACT I FEAR FOR MY CURRENT CLIENT. I FEAR FOR MY FUTURE CLIENTS AND I FEAR FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS BECAUSE THEY WILL BE OUT BE WITHOUT THE POWER TO SUE IN STATE COURT. TO CORRECT AN INJUSTICE WHICH IMPACTS THEIR LIVES FOR THE BETTER. THAT'S NOT FAIR. THAT'S NOT THE RIGHT. THAT'S NOT MY CALIFORNIA. I APPLAUD SENATOR BRADFORD AND I THANK HIM FOR HIS COURAGEOUS EFFORT AT JUSTICE FOLKS I HAVE KNOWN SENATOR BRADFORD BUT MORE THAN THIRTY FIVE YEARS I REMEMBER HE WAS SEEKING MY PENNIES WHEN HE WAS RUNNING FOR CITY COUNCIL IN GARDENA AND NEVER HAVE I BEEN MORE PROUD THAN CENTER BRADFORD THEN NOW. FOR HIS COURAGEOUS EFFORTS ON BEHALF OF ALL CALIFORNIANS EFFORTS FOR JUSTICE I HOPE THIS FIGHT IS NOT OVER. I HOPE TERM AND STONE YOU ARE SINCERE WHEN YOU SAY THAT YOU CONTINUE YOUR TALKS WITH THE BANKING ACT. WE HAVE MADE. SIGNIFICANT ADJUSTMENTS FOR JUSTICE THOSE TRUE PURVEYORS OF JUSTICE SHOULD BE THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF OUR CAUSE. IT IS AN EASY VOTE I SAY TO VOTE HI ON THE KENNETH ROTH DECERTIFICATION BILL OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE IN ITS CURRENT FORM. I LOOK FORWARD TO STAND WITH PRIDE NEXT TO SENATOR BRADFORD WHEN THE BANE ACTIVE COMPONENTS ARE RETURNED. I THANK YOU EVER SO MUCH FOR MY TIME. THANK YOU IS THERE WILL MOVE ON TO OTHERS IN SUPPORT IS THERE ANYONE IN THE HEARING ROOM TO THE LEFT INDICATES SUPPORT FOR SB TO.

RIGHT THANK YOU OPERATOR YOU MAY CLOSE THE LINE THAT WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS MS GONZALEZ. I RESPECT THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH BAY NOT PRIMARILY IN THIS AND I UNDERSTAND SOME OF THE QUESTIONS AND DECERTIFICATION WILL BE DEALT WITH AND PUBLIC SAFETY BUT- AGAIN I. FOR FIRST JUST TO BE CLEAR. I COMPLETELY AGAIN VOTE FOR THIS BILL. BUT I'M REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT SOME OF THE FINER DETAILS SO I JUST WANT TO DOUBLE CHECK ON A FEW THINGS ON THIS. IT'S CLEAR FROM SECTION FOURTEEN IT OUTLINES RIGHT THE DIVISION INVESTIGATE GROUNDS FROM THE EMPLOYING AGENCY BUT MY UNDERSTANDING IS THEY CAN ALSO INVESTIGATE CLAIMS FROM THE PUBLIC CORRECT. YEAH OKAY IT'S IF- IF THIS INCLUDES A STILL EMPLOYED OFFICER IS THE DIVISION REQUIRED TO NOTIFY THE EMPLOYING AGENCY OR THE OFFICER OF AN INVESTIGATION THAT'S ONGOING. STUDENTS TO. EIGHT SO THE PUBLIC REQUEST MASTICATION THE BOARD INVESTIGATES IN THE AGENCY HAS ALERTED THE OFFICER HAS NO RIGHT TO BE ALERTED WELL OR I'M THROUGH THE AGENCY THOUGH THE OFFER WOULD BE MADE AWARE OF THAT WE HOPE OKAY YEAH. I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT THAT'S CLARIFIED I MEAN WE'RE WE'RE NOT VIOLATING THE PLEASE SUCH AS BILL RIGHT TO ANY KIND OF OKAY YOU SEE WHERE I'M GOING WITH THIS AND- SO IT APPEARS THOUGH THAT THERE IS A THREE YEAR STATUTE OF LIMITATION FOR THE BOARD. OF COURSE AT THE PUMP ARE HAS A ONE YEAR STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS. IN THE COMMISSION DECERTIFIED OFFICER IF AN EMPLOYEE AGENCY DECIDED ONLY TO SUSPEND AN OFFICER. FOR ASSUMING SERIOUSNESS CONTACT YOU SEE WHAT NOW. CAN FIRST OF ALL IF THE EMPLOYEE IN THE AGENCY SUSPENDED AN OFFICER CAN THE COMMISSION STILL DECERTIFY THE OFFICER. IF THE ACTIONS WARRANTED THAT YES YOU HAVE POST OR THE COMMISSION DEEMS THOSE ACTIONS FALL UNDER THE GUIDELINES OF WHAT DECERTIFICATION AND JUSTICE BECAUSE THAT AGENCY SUSPENDED THAT ALSO YES THAT OFFICE TO BE TERMINATED WE HAVE CLEAR EXAMPLES WHERE OFFICERS HAVE COMMITTED CRIMES AND JUST BEEN PUT ON DESK DUTY EVEN THOUGH. YOU ARE I WOULD HAVE BEEN CONVICTED OF THOSE OPTIONS OKAY WHAT I WOULD SUGGEST THEN IS THAT THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS UNDER THE DECERTIFICATION PORTION WHICH IS THREE YEARS WOULD VIOLATE POKE BAR WHICH HAS A ONE YEAR STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS AND PERHAPS PEOPLE DISAGREE BUT I THINK- THAT MIGHT BE. AN ISSUE. THAT MAYBE PERHAPS COULD BE RESOLVED AND PUBLIC SAFETY- AND I'M ASSUMING THAT THAT. THE COMMISSION HAS AUTHORITY TO DECERTIFY OFFICERS FOR SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED PRIOR TO JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY TWO SERIOUSNESS COULD START WE ARE AFFORDING THEM LIMIT RETROACTIVITY. OKAY IF THEY ALREADY SUSTAINED A FINE DEAN AND A SUSPENSION OR YOU KNOW ALL AT. DISCIPLINARY PEEL HEARING AND THE OFFICERS BEEN GIVEN LIKE A LAST CHANCE AGREEMENT. THEY CAN STILL INITIATE DECERTIFICATION ON THAT SAME CONDUCT. OR WHAT POPE ARE BE IMPLICATED AT ALL I'M SORRY. SO IF AN OFFICER WAS ALREADY DISCIPLINED BY THE EMPLOYING AGENCY THAT THE BOARD NOW WANTS TO DECERTIFY THIS OFFICER THE OFFICERS ALREADY. EXTINGUISHED ITS APPEAL HAS BEEN AT YOU KNOW HAD APPEAL HEARING HAS ALREADY BEEN PLACED ON A LAST CHANCE AGREEMENT. CAN THE COMMISSION THEN COME IN WHAT WOULD IT NOT IMPLICATE HOPE ARE FOR THE COMMISSION THEN TO COME IN AND DECERTIFY THE OFFICER WHO ALREADY GOT THE PRO THE- THE DISCIPLINARY ACTION. I WANT TO LOOK MAIER- MICHY I ANSWER THAT QUESTION BECAUSE I THINK WE ADDRESS THAT LAST YEAR- WITH- WHAT CONFLICTS DID NOT EXIST UNDER POOL BAR- WHEN WE PUT OUR LETTER TO THE JOURNAL SO I WOULD IF SHE'S STILL ONLINE I WOULD LIKE MISS YOU- ADDRESS SAID SHE CAN'T. IS YOU ARE YOU ON THE LINE. YES CENTER BRADFORD THIS IS JULIE YEAH YOU I DID NOT ADDRESS THE DECERTIFICATION COMPONENT AT THIS BILL LAST YEAR IF I WAS NOT PREPARED TO ANSWER ANY OF THE QUESTIONS I WAS UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT THESE QUESTIONS WOULD BE ANSWERED IN PUBLIC SAFETY. YEAH WE PLAN ON ANSWER MY I JUST THOUGHT YOU MIGHT KNOW IT NO BUT- WE ADDRESS THEM LAST YEAR I NEED TO I'M SORRY IF I. MISSPOKE WE ADDRESS THEM IN OUR LETTER TO JOURNAL LAST YEAR REGARDING P. BARBER YES WE'RE HOPING TO ADDRESS THESE QUESTIONS AND PUBLIC SAFETY ON NEXT WEEK. AND I APOLOGIZE FOR ASKING THEM HERE I'M NOT ON PUBLIC SAFETY AND OBVIOUSLY WILL SEE THIS AND APPROPRIATIONS. I'M CONCERNED THAT THERE ARE ACTUAL JUST FUNCTIONAL ISSUES WITH THE BILL THAT- UNFORTUNATELY WHEN BROUGHT UP EVERYBODY POINTS AND SAYS ARE YOU DON'T SUPPORT THIS I SUPPORT DECERTIFICATION I WANT A BILL THAT WORKS WITH PO BAR- AND DOESN'T. UNDERCUT EIGHT ON ONE WAY OR ANOTHER DOESN'T CREATE MORE LEGAL- PROBLEMS FOR US IN THE FUTURE I'M HOPEFUL. I I'D BE HAPPY TO GIVE YOU A LIST OF QUESTIONS AND PUBLIC SAFETY THAT WE'D LIKE TO SEE ADDRESSED BEFORE IT COMES TO PREPARATIONS. IT'S YOUR CHOICE WHETHER NOT TO DO THAT I JUST I THINK AS- A LEGISLATURE THAT IS REALLY DEALING POLICY TO GET THE SPECIFICS CORRECT IT IS ESSENTIAL WHEN WE KNOW THERE'S A CONFLICT. AND SO THAT'S WHY I WANTEDTO BRING THEM FOR THE SAME ISSUES THAT I BROUGHT UP LAST YEAR- AND HOPEFUL THAT WE CAN. GET THEM SETTLED IN PUBLIC SAFETY BEFORE THIS BECAUSE FRENCH APPROPRIATIONS. GOT RIGHT I'M OF THE BILL THANK YOU THANK YOU WE DO HAVE A MOTION IS THERE A SECOND. ATTOSECOND THANK YOU MR GALLAGHER IN THE MISTER HOLDEN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN- YOU KNOW SENATOR I THINK I FEEL LIKE WE HAVE A MALE A LOT OF PROGRESS FROM LAST YEAR AND A LOT OF THE ISSUES THAT TO MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN DIEGO BROUGHT UP- I WOULD AGREE WITH IS. THAT I THINK WE ALL WANT TO DECERTIFICATION BILL IT'S- IS JUST ABOUT ENSURING THAT- YEAH I MEAN I LIKE IT WE GOT ALL THESE OTHER STATES THAT HAVE IT RIGHT ALL THESE OTHER STATES THAT HAVE A DECERTIFICATION PROCESS WHERE WE JUST LIKE ALMOST COPYING. WHAT THESE OTHER STATES HAVE DONE BECAUSE THEY'VE DEALT WITH THE SAME EXACT ISSUES. THEY WERE ALL TALKING ABOUT. BUT IT SEEMS LIKE WE'RE TRYING TO CREATE A WHOLE NEW- TOTALLY NEW PROCESS THAT'S DIFFERENT AND THAT AND THAT I THINK THE CONCERNS ARE- YOU KNOW KIND OF TWO FOLD ARE YOU KNOW THE CONFLICTS OF KHOBAR. I THINK THERE'S ALSO CONFLICTS WITH ENSURING A FAIR TRIBUNAL ON THE APPEAL PROCESS- YEAH I MEAN ONE THING I THOUGHT ABOUT JUST THINKING ABOUT WHAT THAT SHOULD BE COMPOSED OF WHY NOT HAVING LIKE RETIRED JUDGES OR- YOU KNOW. ATTORNEYS THERE THAT PRACTICE- IN IN IN THIS AREA YOU KNOW JUST TRYING TO ENSURE THAT YOU HAVE KIND OF MORE NEUTRAL. ARBITERS TO MAKE THIS DETERMINATION OF DECERTIFICATION- RATHER THAN THESE LIKE SEVEN APPOINTEES WHICH I THINK IS THE CURRENT MAKE UP OF THE OF THE BILL- YES I HAVE I FEEL LIKE THERE'S DEFINITELY A PLACE TO GET THERE AND HAVE A DECERTIFICATION PROCESS FINALLY. IN ALIFORNIA BUT IT SEEMS LIKE WE'RE KIND OF. DIG IN OUR HEELS IN A LITTLE BIT. AND I FEEL LIKE- THERE'S THE OPPORTUNITY TO REALLY GET SOMETHING THROUGH HERE THAT WOULD BE THAT WOULD. ENSURE THAT BOTH OF THESE THINGS ARE DEALT WITH. PROPERLY THAT WE DON'T HAVE BAD ACTORS OUT THERE THEY'RE JUST GETTING. OSTERSUND MOVED TO OTHER PLACES BUT ARE ACTUALLY THERE OUT OF LAW ENFORCEMENT FOREVER RIGHT- ALSO PROVIDING PROPER DUE PROCESS IN A NEUTRAL- FAIR PROCESS FOR THE OP THE ALLEGATIONS ARE BEING MADE AGAINST- THE OFFICER- SO. TO ME I DON'T THINK WE MOVED A LOT I DON'T THINK COMMITTEE CLOSER THAT'S WHY CAN'T SUPPORTED TODAY- BUT CERTAINLY WOULD LIKE TO SEE US GET TO THAT PLACE. I THANK YOU MR HOLDEN THEN THE MYSTERY OF. THANK YOU ASSURANCE OF THE ACT THANK YOU SENATOR FOR. CONTINUING TO MOVE A VERY IMPORTANT CONVERSATION FOR THIS YEAR NOW PACKAGED IN S. B. TWO OF THIS IS A CONVERSATION AS WELL AS RICK MENTIONED THAT WAS PART OF LAST SESSION AND I KNOW THAT YOU WORKED VERY HARD IN A VERY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME TO TRY TO GET SOME OF THESE VERY COMPLICATED AND- WOVEN. ELEMENTS ARE BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE AND TO HAVE SUCCESS WITH THE LAST YEAR BUT PICKING UP ON THAT AND MOVING FORWARD WITH IT AS YOU HAVE THIS YEAR- I WOULD SAY THAT YOU ARE. MAKING GREAT PROGRESS- THIS WAS CERTAINLY A BILL AS IT RELATES TO THIS COMMITTEE AND THE FOCUS OF THIS COMMITTEE ON THE BAY ENACT- IS SORT OF SINGULAR I THANK THE CHAIRMAN HAS ARTICULATED IN THE ANALYSIS SOME IMPORTANT- ELEMENTS THAT MAKE THAT PART CLARIFIED AND STRONGER- I DO BELIEVE THAT- THIS IS ONE OF THOSE CHALLENGING BILLS BECAUSE YOU HAVE SO MANY DIFFERENT PIECES OF IT. HOUSED IN SO MANY DIFFERENT COMMITTEES THAT REQUIRE A LOT OF- DIGGING INTO THE ELEMENTS THAT YOU'VE ALREADY ARTICULATED IN YOUR OPENING. AND I THINK THAT- THE CHAIR OF APPROPRIATIONS HAS GIVEN OUT SOME THOUGHTS OF WHAT CAN BE PART OF THE CONVERSATION. AND I'M JUST SORT OF GOING OVER THIS IN THE SENSE BECAUSE I UNDERSTAND THE MAGNITUDE OF SOMEHOW HOW CARRYING THESE TYPE OF BILLS- ART. ARE CHALLENGING BECAUSE YOU'RE TRYING. TO MAKE THIS ELEMENT OF LAW ENFORCEMENT- TRANSPARENT. AND ACCOUNTABLE AND YOU HAVE TOUCHED ON COMMITTEE STRUCTURES AND THINGS THAT ACTUALLY WILL BE PASSED OUT MORE IN DETAIL AND PUBLIC SAFETY. BUT I DO KNOW THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS ENGAGE WITH YOU ON THIS SO NOT ONLY IS I A LEGISLATIVE PRIORITY IT'S ALSO ONE WITH ADMINISTRATION. HAS EYES ON IT AS WELL- AND I THINK FOR ALL THE RIGHT REASONS ACHIEVE ARTICULATED I ALSO WANT TO JUST NOTE. THAT A BILL THAT I'M CARRYING THE DEALS WITH- DUTY TO INTERCEDE. THERE WAS A DECERTIFICATION PEACE AND THAT- WHICH WAS TAKEN OUT- APPROPRIATELY SO BECAUSE THIS BILL IS SORT OF BEEN WORKING ITS WAY THROUGH THE PROCESS AND IT MAKES SENSE RATHER THAN HAVE ALL THESE DIFFERENT AREAS THAT YOUR TRUCK WE'RE ALL TRYING TO ADDRESS. BE HANDLED- WHEN DECERTIFYING A POLICE OFFICER WITH A LOSE THEIR JOB THAT IT'S NOT JUST DEALT WITH THE LOCAL LEVEL AS IT RELATES TO- HOW A PERSON WAS THEN AN OFFICER WAS FOUND TO HAVE VIOLATED THE STATUTE THE RULES OF THE OF INTERVENING- BUT THAT THAT WOULD BE THEN HANDLED BY THIS OVER PARKING UMBRELLA WHICH YOU'RE CREATING. THE STRUCTURE SO IT ADDS CLARITY AND APPROPRIATE ACCOUNTABILITY SO I pI DON'T I DON'T MEAN TO SAY WHEN I SAY IT'S CONTINUES TO BE WORK IN PROGRESS BUT BECAUSE YOU HAVE ANOTHER COMMITTED TO GO TO. THERE'S STILL A LOT OF QUESTIONS THAT I THINK CAN PROBABLY BE ANSWERED AND STILL CONCERNS THEY CAN PROBABLY STILL BE ADDRESSED I'M A CO. AUTHOR WHATEVER CO AUTHOR. ON THE BILL AND SO I CERTAINLY SUPPORTED IN A SUPPORT- YOUR CONSISTENT EFFORT. AS WAS ARTICULATED BY A COUPLE OF THE SPEAKERS. BECAUSE THESE ARE NOT EASY BILLS- TO MOVE. TO CLOSURE- DISCUSS DR SHIRLEY WEBER- AND OTHERS WHO'VE TRIED TO EMBARK ON DOESN'T HAPPEN IN ONE YEAR. SOMETIMES IT TAKES MULTIPLE YEARS AND YOU'RE IN THAT PROCESS NOW. AND SO I THINK YOU'RE POISED TO LAND THE PLANE. I THINK THAT THE ELEMENTS OF THIS BILL ARE RIGHTEOUS AND APPROPRIATE TO PURSUE. THERE ARE CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED YOU'VE ALREADY INDICATED YOUR WILLINGNESS A TO TRY TO MEET. A LAW ENFORCEMENT ARE AT A PLACE WHERE YOU CAN- APPROPRIATELY ADDRESSED THOSE CONCERNS. I TRUST YOU'LL BE ABLE TO DO THAT. I TRUST THE TEACHERS. GUIDANCE FOR YOU TODAY- WITHOUT MAKING IT TIED TO THIS ACTION BUT JUST TO- INSTEAD OF IN FORM. OF THE COMMITTEE THAT IT'S MOVING TOWARDS PUBLIC SAFETY. OF SOME OF THE AREAS THAT THIS COMMITTEE WOULD LIKE TO SEE ADDRESSED AT LEAST AS IT RELATES TO THE BAN ACT. SO I APPRECIATE YOUR LEADERSHIP. YOUR. OF STEADFASTNESS. AND COMMITMENT TO THE CAUSE- MY PLEASURE TO BE ABLE TO SECOND THE MOTION. I DO APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT SOMEBODY HAS TO PUSH THIS FORWARD AND I APPRECIATE YOUR LEADERSHIP IN THIS AS WELL. I THINK THE COMMENTS MADE IN THE ANALYSIS AND SINCE THE ANALYSIS THE DISCUSSIONS YOU HAD WITH THE CHAIR WITH COMMITTEE ARE EXTREMELY IMPORTANT BECAUSE I THINK THAT IT. IN THE END WE WANT SOMETHING THAT IS GOING TO BE WORKABLE THAT IS GOING TO ACTUALLY MAKE IT THROUGH TO THE GOVERNOR'S DESK. OF THE COMMENTS MADE BY MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN DIEGO. YOU'RE RIGHT THOSE ARE COMMENTS WERE MADE LAST YEAR AND I KNOW THAT THERE WAS A COMMITMENT LAST YEAR TO WORK ON THOSE. WE DIDN'T THE BILL DIDN'T GET AS FAR AS IT SHOULD HAVE A COULD HAVE. THE ONE AREA- BUT I THINK IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. IS THE MAKEUP OF THE BOARD. AND THEIR COMMENTS WERE MADE HERE. HI MY COLLEAGUES ALSO BY MR READ REGARDING THE MAKEUP OF THE BOARD. THE DECERTIFICATION I THINK THAT EVERYBODY IS ON BOARD ON THAT TRYING TO GET TO THAT POINT IN FIGURING OUT WHAT THE ACCOUNTABILITY WHAT THE SAFEGUARDS ARE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE GET THERE. ARE EXTREMELY IMPORTANT I APPRECIATE THAT- AS MY COLLEAGUE HAS HAS INDICATED YOUR WORK WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT THEY ARE A NECESSARY PARTNER HERE. BECAUSE WE DO HAVE MEMBERS FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT THAT WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY GET THE BAD APPLES OUT. I APPRECIATE YOUR WORK WITH THAT AS WELL- READING THIS JUSTICE SYSTEM THAT WORKS FOR EVERYBODY. IT'S GOING TO TAKE A LOT OF TENACITY AND I'M GLAD THAT YOU'RE THERE THANK YOU THE. SO WITH THAT- THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR THIS IS A OBVIOUSLY HUGELY CHALLENGING BILL- AND YOU'VE GOT- ALL THESE. PARTY'S SWAIN AND FROM YOU KNOW UP AND DOWN THE STATE SO- I KNOW THIS IS BEEN QUITE A LEFT I REALIZE THAT TODAY YOU KNOW WE'RE TALKING. ABOUT ISSUES BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE SOME OF I THINK ARE ISSUES THAT ALL OF US HAVE. GOOD BAD AND INDIFFERENT COVER. THAT IS SOMETHING THAT I WOULD PROBABLY BRING UP PROBABLY ARE. BETTER I GUESS APPARENTLY GOING TO BE HEARD IN THE PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE SAME GONNA TRY TO LIMIT. MY COMMENTS TO FOR THE MOST PART TO WHAT AT WHAT IS HERE BEFORE THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE. AS YOU OF. THE CERTIFICATION- I THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S IMPORTANT- AN IMPORTANT ISSUE THAT WE AS A LEGISLATURE NEED TO ADDRESS. I DO WANT TO. HELP HOWEVER I DO WANT TO. ADD MY VOICE THAT. I THINK HOW DOUBLE. THE MEMBERSHIP ON THE BOARD IS IMPORTANT AND CRITICAL- AND HOW WE GET TO THESE- ALTERNATE KIND OF IT HOW POWER GOING TO ADMINISTER THESE. THIS FROM A JUDICIAL STANDPOINT IN THIS CAN BE LITIGATED WE CAN ALL SEE THE MASSIVE AMOUNT OF LITIGATION THAT COULD COME OUT OF THIS. AND THAT'S NOT GONNA SERVE ANYBODY WELL- IF THIS ENDS UP JUST BEING SWALLOWED UP IN A MORASS OF COURT CASES. SO I REALIZED. I BELIEVE CENTER BRADFORD THAT THAT ISSUE IS GOING TO BE ADDRESSED BEFORE THE PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE- IN A LITTLE BIT MORE DEPTH BUT- AND PROBABLY NICK I'M ASSUMING ALSO IN. NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE. AND I MISS M. AND T. NONSENSE. BUT BUT I DO JUST WANT TO ADD MY VOICE TO THAT BUT I THINK I THINK THAT'S A VERY IMPORTANT ASPECT OF THIS LEGISLATION THAT DOESN'T GET LOST OR SWALLOWED UP IN SOME OF THESE OTHER DETAILS- SO I'D ASK FOR YOU TO CONTINUE THINKING THAT THROUGH CONTINUE WORKING WITH. ALL THE PARTIES ON THAT- BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO BE VERY IMPORTANT MAKE SURE THE RIGHT THINGS ULTIMATELY GET DONE. OKAY THANK YOU. SEEN I'M SEEING THE NOT IN SOME NO I DON'T. THANK YOU FOR YOUR HELP. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I THINK THE- AUTHOR OF FOR BRING THIS FOR AND ALL THE HARD WORK IN THE HARD WORK OF ALL THE- ADVOCATES AND SUPPORTERS AS WELL AS OPPOSITION TO THAT IS- ENGAGE AS THEY INDICATE- THEY'RE NOT OPPOSED. TO THE CONCEPT OF THE CERTIFICATION AND WE HAVE TO FIND A PLACE TO LAND I AND I'D APPRECIATE COMMENTS MY COLLEAGUES ON THE COMMITTEE. HAS WON SAID THAT WOULD ULTIMATELY EVEN WITH THE HERCULEAN EFFORT OF THIS BILL- HOPEFULLY MAKE IT TO THE GOVERNOR AND THE CONVERSATION WITH THE MINISTRATION GETTING SIGNED- IS PART OF THE MOVEMENT- AND THE GREATER MOVEMENT OF US FACING REALLY UNCOMFORTABLE TRUTHS- THAT DON'T. SIMPLY DEAL WITH APPLE ARE REALLY. A ROCK- WE HAVE A SYSTEM THAT THAT HAS WROUGHT THAT WE HAVE TO. UPROOT AND THIS IS PART OF THAT PROCESS AND IT'S GOING TO BE UNCOMFORTABLE. FOR MANY THE STAKEHOLDERS- AND IT'S HARD NOT TO GET DEFENSIVE IF YOU'RE PART OF LAW ENFORCEMENT- WHEN. YOU HAVE THESE ISSUES ABOUT FOUR BUT THE REALITY IS THAT ALL OF US. IN THOSE OF US LEGISLATURE HAVE TO TAKE A LOOK IN THE MIRROR AND RECOGNIZE. NOT ONLY THE ROLE. THAT THIS BODY HAS PLAYED OVER GENERATIONS. IN CREATING- THE CURRENT SYSTEM THAT DOES NOT. REACH AND THAT IS JUST- BUT HOW OLD THE STAKEHOLDERS EMPLOYERS HAVE PLAYED A ROLE AS WELL OVER THE GENERATIONS. WE HAVE THIS UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY IN THIS MOMENT- AS PART OF THIS GROUP AS PART OF THE GREATER MOVEMENT- TO ENSURE THAT- THERE IS ACCOUNTABILITY AND JUSTICE. THAT THERE IS DUE PROCESS FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT BUT ALSO DUE PROCESS- FOR THE VICTIMS AND THE FAMILIES THAT SUFFER- AND- THOSE WORDS SOUND EASY BUT YOU'RE DOING THE DIFFICULT WORK AND I APPRECIATE IT BECAUSE- IT IS INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT. NO PATH TO WALK DOWN BUT WE HAVE TO WALK DOWN IT AND AS A PRINCIPAL CALOTTERY PRECIADO. YOUR WORK IN IN TRYING TO SEEK JUSTICE END UP IN A- IN A MORE EQUITABLE SYSTEM GOING FURTHER BUT LIKE I SAID THIS IS GOING TO BE I THINK A LONG PROCESS FOR ALL OF US MOVING FORWARD AND WE HAVE TO BE COMMITTED TO LONG HAULS. THANK YOU. TRANSACTION FAILING. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER SPEAKER- MISTER CHAIR I FEEL COMPELLED TO SPEAK BECAUSE- I WAS EXPLICITLY CALLED OUT BY ONE OF THE CALLERS AND I THINK I KNOW WHY BECAUSE I DID NOT SUPPORT YOUR BILL LAST YEAR IN THIS VERY COMMITTEE AND YET YOU KNOW I MUST ADMIT THAT AT THE TIME I WASN'T. VERY COMFORTABLE WITH. YOU KNOW THE LANGUAGE ITSELF. US INSTEAD YOU FAR YOU KNOW DEMONSTRATED YOU. CONTINUE TO WORK THE ISSUE AND I THINK THAT IS THE ISSUE OF- THE CERTIFICATION IS SOMETHING THAT WE ALL. NEED TO WORK ON IT IS SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO BE RESOLVED AROUND. SO I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR. FOR YOUR CAN YOU LEADERSHIP. AND I'VE HAD TO. YOU KNOW CHANCE TO SPEAK TO NUMEROUS OF PARTIES AND PEOPLE SINCE LAST YEAR AND REALLY HAD A CHANCE TO REALLY. YOU KNOW DO A LITTLE. DEEPER TAKING ON THE ISSUE SO I WANT TO I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK AND- AND I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY. AND I JUST WANT TO EXPRESS MY GRATITUDE TO YOU AND YOUR TEAM. OF FOR YOUR HARD WORK- OVER THE YEARS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. EXCEPT IT. THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATOR- I'M JUST GOING TO ECHO MY COLLEAGUES HERE IS SOME. REAL SUPPORT TO DEFEAT CATION ESPECIALLY WILL BE GOT THE BAD ACTORS OUT THERE BUT LIKE A LOT OF THEM. MY CONCERN IS THIS BOARD THIS COMMITTEE- IT IT'S SO IMPORTANT THAT WE DO IT THE RIGHT WAY AND- IT DOESN'T MATTER WHERE YOU'RE AT WHEN YOU HAVE. MEMBERS THAT ARE APPOINTED YOU CAN SOMETIMES GO ONE WAY OR THE OTHER. AND SO I THINK THAT'S REALLY REALLY- YOU KNOW CRITICAL THAT WE THAT WE HAVE A CLEAR PROCESS OF TRANSPARENCY PROCESS. AND THAT THERE'S A BALANCE THERE SO THAT WHEN THESE THINGS GO DOWN WHEN THEY DO HAVE JUDGMENTS. PEOPLE CAN FEEL LIKE THERE WAS JUSTICE AND IT WAS FAIR- FROM BEGINNING TO THE END SO. AT THAT POINT BECAUSE TO ME THIS IS SO IMPORTANT- AND IT'S SUCH A- IMPORTANT PART OF THIS BILL. I'M NOT GOING TO BE PRETTY GOOD THIS TIME I'M GOING TO SIT THERE AND WATCH WHERE IT GOES AND PUBLIC SAFETY. BUT I THINK THAT I'M LISTENING TO MY COLLEAGUES THIS IS PROBABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT. AREAS RIGHT THERE IS MAKING SURE WE HAVE A FAIR AND BALANCED COMMITTEE THAT WOULD BE MAKING THESE DECISIONS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU OTHER MEMBER COMMENTS QUESTIONS RIGHT SEEING NONE CENTER APPRECIATE YOUR WORK ON THIS AND WE HEARD THIS LAST YEAR AND WE HEAR THIS AGAIN WE SUPPORT THE CERTIFICATION JUST NOT THIS NOT THIS THAN WHAT AND THEN THERE ARE SOME CONCERNS BUT WE ALSO KEEP HEARING THIS OVERARCHING JUST NOT THIS JUST NOT THIS JUST NOT THIS IN THAT CASE WE'LL- NEVER GET THERE. YEAH FOR THIS COMMITTEE WE REALLY TRIED TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE BAY ENACT. I'M AFRAID MOVING FORWARD IN. I UNDERSTAND THE POLITICS BUT- THE- ADDING CONFUSION TO AN UNDERMINING THE BANE ACT IS SOMETHING THAT I REMAIN CONCERNED ABOUT I KNOW YOU REMAIN CONCERNED ABOUT SO WE'RE JUST GOING TO TRY AND CONTINUE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN DO THE BEST THAT WE CAN AND STILL MOVE SOMETHING FORWARD. IT WOULD BE. VERY BAD FOR THIS LEGISLATURE TO NOT MOVE SOMETHING FORWARD THIS YEAR AND MAKE THE BEST PROGRESS THAT WE- POSSIBLY CAN AND I THINK WE'LL FIND THE SKY IS NOT FALLING THAT THAT THESE ARE APPROPRIATE STEPS AN APPROPRIATE. VERSIONS TO ENSURE THAT WE PROVIDE THE SAFETY IN OUR COMMUNITIES THAT IS NECESSARY AND- BREAK DOWN THIS LONG STANDING. CULTURE OF SORT OF SELF PROTECTION THAT HAS EXISTED SO I KNOW YOUR FRUSTRATION WE SPENT QUITE A BIT OF TIME ON THE PHONE LAST NIGHT WORKING THROUGH SOME OF THIS SO I AM HOPING THAT. THE REQUESTED THIS GETS OUT OF THE COMMITTEE. TODAY AND I KNOW YOU'RE WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH MR JONES SAWYER FOR PUBLIC SAFETY. AND I WISH YOU THE BEST THERE AS WE MOVE THE POLICY FORWARD. OKAY WITH THAT SENATOR YOU MAY CLOSE THANK YOU AND LET ME SAY THANK YOU TO EACH AND EVERYONE OF YOU WHO POSED THE QUESTION I REALLY JUST WANT TO. ADDRESS THE PROBAR ISSUE THAT AND I JUST SURE WHAT ARE MY STATEMENT WAS LARGE JOURNAL STEERED AGAIN. IN MOST SENSES POLLS WILL OFTEN RELY ON THE INVESTIGATION AND THE FINDINGS OF THE LOCAL ENFORCEMENT AGENCY TO LEAD TO THE TERMINATION OF OFFICERS. AND THOSE INVESTIGATIONS BY LOCAL AGENCIES ALL POLL BAR RIGHTS WILL APPLY. AND NOTHING IN THIS BILL ALLOWS LOCAL AGENCIES TO CONDUCT AN INVESTIGATION THE BY LIGHT POLE BARS. RIGHT I THINK WE MADE IT CLEAR LAST YEAR WE'RE GOING TO MAKE IT CLEAR AGAINWE'RE NOT HERE TO VIOLATE. OFFICERS RIGHTS I HAVE ONE FOUR SEVEN IN MY FAMILY I HAVE DEAR FRIENDS WHO HAVE JUST RETIRED THIRTY FIVE YEARS WITH LAPD WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS MEASURE. WE TALK ABOUT BAD APPLES WELL THERE'S SOME BAD TREES THAT ARE PRODUCING A WHOLE LOT OF BAD APPLES AND LAW ENFORCEMENT AND POLITICS AND EDUCATION. AND OUR RELIGIOUS SYSTEM AND WE HAVE TO COME TO THAT REALIZATION FOR SOME REASON. POLICING IS A HOLY GRAIL FOR. IF YOU'RE NOT PART OF LAW ENFORCEMENT YOU CAN'T JUDGE LAW ENFORCEMENT WE'VE HAD A HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEARS OF THE POLICE POLICING THE POLICE AND IT'S GOTTEN US. ABSOLUTELY NOWHERE. AND WE'RE DEVOID OF TRUST AND CONFIDENCE THIS IS WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE HERE TRUST AND CONFIDENCE IN LAW ENFORCEMENT BECAUSE WE ALL WANT THE SAME THING. ABLE OFFICER DRIVES ON THE STREET THAT WE CAN RESPECT AND WE CAN TRUST TO DO THE RIGHT THING AND PROTECT AND SERVE OUR COMMUNITIES AND THAT'S WHAT 90% OF THOSE OFFICERS DO. THOSE MEN AND WOMEN WHO PUT THEIR UNIFORMS UP EVERY DAY THAT'S WHAT THEY DO. BUT WE ALL KNOW THE REALITIES THERE IS A 10% OUT THERE. ARE BAD APPLES. WHO STAINED THE REST OF THE DEPARTMENT BUY THEIR PRODUCT THAT THEY CONDUCT EVERY DAY WE'VE SEEN. THE LAST THREE YEARS THERE'S BEEN THIRTEEN HUNDRED POLICE SHOOTINGS. ALL THOSE THIRTEEN HUNDRED NOMINEE OFFICERS WERE CHARGED. THIRTEEN ALTHOUGH THIRTEEN IT WAS CHARGED HOW MANY WERE CONVICTED ONE. WE WOULD GO TO VEGAS WITH THOSE ODDS ANY DAY. IT'S CLEAR AS A WISE MAN ONCE STATED TO ME IF YOU KEEP DOING WHAT YOU'RE DOING YOU'RE GOING TO KEEP GETTING WHAT YOU GET AND THAT'S NOTHING SO. WHY NOT TRUST THE PUBLIC THIS ADVISORY BOARD DOES NOT HAVE FINAL SAY. BUT THEY DO HAVE A RIGHT TO ADVICE POST ADVICE THE COMMISSION TO SAY LET'S LOOK AT THIS. WHY ARE WE SO AFRAID OF JOHN THROUGH PUBLIC. PORTRUSH DUST EVERY DAY. TO MAKE LOST IMPACT EVERYBODY'S WATER BUT WE WON'T TRUST SEVEN CITIZENS SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT IN LAW ENFORCEMENT. I HAVE A NEIGHBOR. WHO IS ALSO WANTED TOP DEFENSE ATTORNEYS PROBABLY L. A. COUNTY OF NOT IN THE STATE HE WAS ON THE BENCH HE RESIGNED FROM THE BENCH BECAUSE OF THE INCESTUOUS RELATIONSHIP THAT IN EXISTING BETWEEN. THE DA INVESTIGATING AGENCIES WHICH IS POLICE THE FACT THAT IT WAS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO EVER GET AN INDICTMENT LET ALONE A CHARGE ON A POLICE OFFICER. THAT SHOULD BE TROUBLING TO EACH AND EVERYONE OF US BUT IT'S CLEAR THE POLICE CANNOT CONTINUE TO POLICE THEMSELVES SO THIS ADVISORY BOARD IS JUST MADE UP OF INDIVIDUALS. WHO DON'T HAVE ANY BIAS AGAINST POLICE OFFICERS THEY MIGHT OUT FEARS. BUT THEY SHOULDN'T BE VIEWED AS PEOPLE WHO HAVE BIASES WE TRUST TWELVE CITIZENS EVERY DAY. IN A JURY. TO MAKE DECISIONS ON LIFE AND DEATH WHY SHOULD WE TRUST SEVEN AND THIS IS WE'RE NOT RECREATING WILL. MASSACHUSETTS HAS THE SAME THING THEY HAVE A COMMITTEE OF NINE PEOPLE THE ONLY DIFFERENCE. THEY HAVE THREE LAW ENFORCEMENT AND SIX CITIZENS WERE SAYING SEVEN AND TO. AND TO SAY THAT WE HAVEN'T MOVED WE'VE GONE LIGHT YEARS FROM WHERE WE WERE LAST YEAR TO WHERE WE ARE WE'VE MADE MONUMENTAL STRIDES. BUT I'M SOMEWHAT AMUSED AT THE FACT THAT EVERYBODY SAYS. WE WANT. WE SUPPORT THE CERTIFICATION I'VE SAT DOWN AND TALKED SOME BLUE IN THE FACE WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT WE WANT THE CERTIFICATION WE WANT TO SERVE KIDS BUT JUST NOT THIS BILL. THAT'S ISN'T WHAT DO YOU SUGGEST YOUR HOW DO WE IMPROVE THIS BILL AND EVERYTHING THAT THEY SUGGEST DOES NOT IMPROVE THIS BILL. IT WEAKENS WHAT WE ALL SAY WE WANT. SO AT SOME POINT WE ALL NEED TO LOOK OURSELVES IN THE MIRROR. AND QUICK. PARROTING WHAT LAW ENFORCEMENT CONTINUES TO SAY THAT THEY WANT BUT THEY DON'T WANT THIS ONE IF NOT NOW THEN WHEN. IF NOT US THEN WHO IT'S TIME TO MAKE A DECISION. MARLOWE THE KINGS CROSS ST IT COMES A TIME WHEN YOU HAVE TO TAKE POSITION THAT'S NEITHER SAFE. NOR POLITIC. OR POPULAR. WE TAKE IT BECAUSE I CONSCIOUS% TELLS IS JUST RIGHT THING TO DO. THIS IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO I RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL.

SIX NINE TWO EIGHT NINE FIVE SEVEN. AND THE DIAL IN IS ONE THREE ONE. FIVE FOUR TWO. OH TWO WE HAVE OUR MODERATOR WE HAVE OUR SYSTEM UP SO WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE WITH OUR AGENDA AND THE BILLS THAT WE HAVE BEEN. WORKING THROUGH SO SENATOR SKINNER. THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE SORRY FOR ALL THE WAITING TODAY AS WE WORK THROUGH EVERYTHING WILL SAY WE HAVE. I ITEMS THREE AND FOUR SB SIXTEEN AND THEN SB. THREE FIFTY FOUR. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- DON'T MIND WAITING SLICE GET TO GET IT DONE SO I'M PRESENTING- SB SIXTEEN AND I'M HAPPY TO ACCEPT THE AMENDMENTS IN THE ANALYSIS REGARDING CLARIFICATIONS ON ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE AND REQUIRING DISCLOSURE OF FACTUAL INFORMATION- THIS BILL IS A REINTRODUCTION. OF SB SEVEN SEVEN SIX WHICH WAS BEFORE YOU LAST YEAR IN WHICH GOT FIFTY THREE VOTES ON YOUR FLOOR CAN IN FACT THE BILL THAT GOT FIFTY THREE VOTES ON YOUR FLOOR HAD EVEN MORE STRINGENT REQUIREMENTS IN THIS ONE THERE'S BEEN SOME AMENDMENTS- THE BILL HAS BEEN MODIFIED. TO ADDRESS SOME CONCERNS OF POLICE CHIEFS AND OTHERS AND ALL DESCRIBE THAT IN THE MIDDLE IN A MINUTE. THE REASON. WHY THIS BILL IS NOT YET LAW IS BECAUSE IN THAT CHAOS OF THE LAST DAY OF SESSION- DAIRY. IT GOT SENT OVER THE SENATE BUT NOT IN TIME FOR THE MIDNIGHT DEADLINE FOR US TO TAKE IT UP SO I'VE REINTRODUCED AND EVERY INTRODUCED BECAUSE- THIS BUILDS ON. A BILL THAT WE PASSED A FEW YEARS AGO CALIFORNIA IS AN OUTLIER STATE WE HAD FORTY YEARS WE'RE NO. RECORDS REGARDING POLICE MISCONDUCT WERE AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC ZERO PERIOD EVEN THOUGH WE HAVE A GREAT PUBLIC RECORDS ACT IN EVERY OTHER CATEGORY PUBLIC EMPLOYEES IS SUBJECTED TO IT. SO THE FIRST BILL LED A VERY LIMITED SET OF PUBLIC RECORDS ABOUT. PUBLIC ABOUT A POLICE MISCONDUCT BE AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC. THIS ADDS TO THAT BILL IT ADDS SOME ADDITIONAL CATEGORIES OF ACTIONS THAT CAN BE ALLOWED FOR PUBLIC DISCLOSURE. AND IT ADDS A LITTLE BIT OF- TEETH BECAUSE WE HAD UNFORTUNATELY SOME JURISDICTIONS DRAG THEIR FEET. AND NOT RESPOND TO THEIR PUBLIC RECORDS REQUEST SO SPECIFICALLY. SB SIXTEEN STRENGTHENS OUR CURRENT LAW. BY EXPANDING ACCESS TO RECORDS ON OFFICERS WHO ENGAGED IN. UNREASONABLE AND EXCESSIVE FORCE. WHO HAVE ENGAGED IN RACIST HOMOPHOBIC ANTI SEMITIC OR OTHER DISCRIMINATORY AND BIASED ACTIONS. WHO ENGAGE IN UNLAWFUL ARRESTS OR SEARCHES FOR ENGAGING DISHONESTY SUCH AS FRAMING PEOPLE. AND IT ALSO HELPS ENSURE THAT AN OFFICER WHO MAY BE ACCUSED OF SOMETHING CAN'T JUST QUIT THEIR DEPARTMENT AND MOVE ON TO THE NEXT APARTMENT WITHOUT HAVING ANY RECORD FALL OF THEM BECAUSE WHAT WAS HAPPENING IS AN OFFICER WOULD QUIT BEFORE THE INVESTIGATION WAS COMPLETED IN MOST OF THESE RECORDS HAVE TO BE AN INVESTIGATION HAS TO BE COMPLETED IN SUSTAIN FINDINGS. BEFORE THEY WOULD BE MADE PUBLIC SO IT ALSO REQUIRES RECORDS TO BE ESTABLISHED IF THE- OFFICER RESIGNS BIRD INVESTIGATION AND IT HELPS PREVENT THAT SITUATION WHERE A JURISDICTION SAYS HEY. WE HAD NO IDEA THAT THIS OFFICER HAD THIS HISTORY WHEN THEY HIRED THEM SO IT REQUIRES. AGENCIES TO GET THE RECORDS ON OFFICERS THEY'RE CONSIDERING TO HIGHER SO THAT THEY KNOW THEY HAVE THEIR FULL INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR BACKGROUND- AND WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO HAVE MY WITNESSES WHO- WE HAVE NATASHA MINSKER FROM SMART JUSTICE AND THE HEAD OF THE CALIFORNIA POLICE CHIEFS ASSOCIATION CHIEF ABDEL PROTECTION. THANK YOU AND- WE I DO HAVE THOSE TWO WITNESSES LISTED NATASHA MINSKER AND CHIEF PRIDGEN THE TASHA MINSKER. GOOD AFTERNOON NATASHA MINSKER ON BEHALF OF SMART JUSTICE CALIFORNIA SB SIXTEEN IS A MODEST NON CONTROVERSIAL PROPOSAL THAT SEEKS TO ADDRESS THE ROADBLOCKS THAT FAMILY MEMBERS COMMUNITIES AND REPORTERS HAVE ENCOUNTERED IN TRYING TO ACCESS POLICE MISCONDUCT RECORDS UNDER CENTER SKINNER'S LANDMARK BILL SB FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE. FOR EXAMPLE DEPARTMENTS NOW ROUTINELY DESTROY RECORDS THAT THEY ARE LEGALLY PERMITTED TO DO THEY REFUSE TO DISCLOSE RECORDS WHEN AN OFFICER RESIGNS DURING INVESTIGATION THEY CHARGE FAMILY MEMBERS THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS FOR QUOTE COPYING FEES TO REPRODUCE RECORDS THAT ARE STORED IN A DIGITAL FORMAT THAT CAN BE EASILY REPRODUCED. THESE ARE THE KINDS OF ROADBLOCKS THAT FAMILY MEMBERS COMMUNITY MEMBERS REMEMBERS AND RECORDERS HAVE ENCOUNTERED IN TRYING TO ACCESS MISCONDUCT RECORDS AND THESE ARE THE ROAD BLOCK SB SIXTY SIXTEEN REMOVED ENSURING THAT THE PUBLIC'S RIGHT TO KNOW IS NEEDING FALL ADS ORIGINALLY INTENDED BY THE LEGISLATURE. THE BILL PROVIDES MODEST ACCESS TO AN ADDITIONAL SET OF RECORDS THAT ARE CRITICALLY IMPORTANT FOR THE PUBLIC IN UNDERSTANDING WHETHER THEIR LOCAL DEPARTMENT IS TAKING SERIOUSLY ACCUSATIONS OF MISCONDUCT OR EXCESSIVE FORCE BY POLICE DEPARTMENTS. SB SIXTEEN IS A MODEST PROPOSAL ON BEHALF OF BOTH SMARTER TO CALIFORNIA AND THE PROSECUTORS ALIGNED TO CALIFORNIA I. URGE YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU.

OUR COMMUNITIES MUST KNOW AND TRUST THAT WE HOLD OFFICERS ACCOUNTABLE VIOLATE LAW OR POLICY. UNFORTUNATELY IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE HISTORICALLY RESTRICTED THE RELEASE A POLICE DISCIPLINARY FILES. TO THE DETRIMENT OF PUBLIC TRUST. YOU CANNOT EXPECT THE PUBLIC TO HAVE FAITH IN OUR ADMINISTRATION OF DISCIPLINE WHO ARE NOT OPENLY SHARING THE INFORMATION. THAT IS WHY TPC AID SUPPORTED CENTER SKINNERS ORIGINAL LEGISLATION TO ALLOW THE RELEASE OF SPECIFIC DISCIPLINARY FILES AND IT IS WHY WE ARE SUPPORTING SENATE BILL SIXTEEN TODAY. POLICE CHIEF CONSISTENTLY ADMINISTER DISCIPLINE WHEN OFFICERS USED EXCESSIVE FORCE CONDUCT UNLAWFUL SEARCHES OR DISCRIMINATE AGAINST COMMUNITY MEMBERS CATEGORIES INCLUDED IN SENATE SIXTEEN.

UNTIL THE ENACTMENT OF SB FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE FROM TWENTY EIGHTEEN STATUTE AND CASE LAW PROVIDED ENHANCE AN APPROPRIATE PRIVACY PROTECTIONS FOR PEACE OFFER PERSONAL RECORDS AS WELL AS METHODS AND CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH RECORDS CAN BE ACCESSED. SENATE BILL FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE MADE SPECIFIED RECORDS AVAILABLE FOR PUBLIC DISCLOSURE BUT MAINLY LIMITED THE SCOPE OF WHAT COULD BE RELEASED. TO RECORDS RELATING TO USES OF FORCE THAT RESULTED IN DEATH OR GREAT BODILY INJURY. OR OTHER SITUATIONS IN WHICH A COMPLAINT OF WRONGDOING HAD BEEN SUSTAINED. SENATE BILL SIXTEEN EXPANDS THE RECORDS. ON USE OF FORCE ALLEGATIONS THAT CAN BE RELEASED TO INCLUDE COMPLAINTS THAT ALLEGE UNREASONABLE OR EXCESSIVE FORCE. WE APPRECIATE VERY MUCH THE AUTHORS AMENDMENTS- REGARDING THE ATTORNEY CLIENT. PRIVILEGE THAT WERE DISCUSSED IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS- WE ALSO APPRECIATE THE AMENDMENTS TAKEN EARLIER. TO THE BILL TO REMOVE PROVISIONS RELATED TO CIVIL FINES IN THE ABILITY TO SEE COSTS ATTORNEY'S FEES. ON BEHALF OF THE STATE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION OF THE BILL WERE FURTHER AMENDED TO LIMIT THE NEW USE OF FORCE PROVISION DESCRIBED ABOVE. TO PERMIT DISCLOSURE OF RECORDS RELATED TO AN INCIDENT INVOLVING A SUSTAIN FINDING OF EXCESSIVE FORCE. CSSA WOULD REMOVE ITS OPPOSITION- AND FURTHER IN CONSIDERATION THE COMMITTEES TIME I WOULD ALSO NOTE THE OPPOSITION OF THE CALIFORNIA LAW ENFORCEMENT ASSOCIATION OF RECORDS SUPERVISORS.

THANK YOU. THANK YOU RYAN FOR NINETY SIX PLEASE GO AHEAD. HI THIS IS MATTHEW EASILY REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA CORRECTIONAL PEACE OFFICERS ASSOCIATION WERE OPPOSED LAS AMENDED FOR THE SAME REASONS IS THE PERFECT THANK YOU. THANK YOU I HAVE NO FURTHER COMMENTS THANK YOU AT THIS TIME RIGHT THANK YOU OPERATOR YOU CAN CLOSE THE. TELEPHONES AND I WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. DISCO. THANK YOU SENATOR- I KNOW ONE OF THINGS IT WAS BROUGHT ABOUT POSITION IS ON USE OF FORCE THAT IT COULD INCLUDE COMPLAINTS OF EXCESSIVE FORCE WHERE THE OFFICER WAS NOT FOUND TO HAVE ENGAGED THERE WASN'T A SUSTAIN FINDING- OR THERE WAS INCONCLUSIVE YOU KNOW MIGHT BE THE THING THAT COMES BACK- IN THOSE TYPES OF SITUATIONS I MEAN SHOULD I BE LIKE THESE OTHER ONES THAT SHOULD BE AN ACTUAL SUSTAIN FINDING THAT IN FACT. THAT DID OCCUR NOT JUST TO COMPLAIN. WE MADE THAT SECTION OF THE LAW CONSISTENT WITH THE SECTION ON THE A DEADLY USE OF FORCE IN THE ORIGINAL BILL. AND THOSE ARE THE ONLY TWO SECTIONS WHERE DOES NOT HAVE TO BE ASSISTING FINDING. AND- ALL OTHER SECTIONS HAVE TO BE SUSTAINED FINDINGS. AND WHAT WAS KIND OF THE REASON FOR THAT I GUESS WELL PARTLY IT'S- HEY. IN THE QUESTION OF FORCE THERE IS. WE WOULD SAY SOME LEVEL OF SUBJECTIVITY THERE IS- OBVIOUSLY LITTLE TO NO SAID CHECK TIVITY AROUND SEXUAL ASSAULT- IN VARIOUS- SO THE- SENSE WAS THAT. IF THAT THE PUBLIC HAS A RIGHT TO KNOW IF THERE IS AN OFFICER WITH THE HISTORY OF. COMPLAINTS AROUND USE OF FORCE. AND THAT WHILE THERE IS OBVIOUSLY LAW ENFORCEMENT'S FEAR THAT THERE MAY BE SITUATIONS WHERE THERE ARE FRIVOLOUS FRIVOLOUS SUCH COMPLAINTS. I THINK ON BALANCE. IN MOST AGENCIES ARE UP AND DOWN THE STATE YOU DON'T HAVE A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF FRIVOLOUS TYPES OF SUCH COMPLAINTS BUT RATHER YOU HAVE. CITIZENS RESIDENTS INDICATING WHEN THEY FELT FORCE WHICH USED AND THAT SEEMS TO BE VERY LEGITIMATE INFORMATION FOR- FOR THE PUBLIC TO KNOW BECAUSE THE POINT OF THE BILL IS FOR TO HOPE TO HOLD AGENCIES ACCOUNTABLE. AND IF WE TAKE AND WE DDED THIS ISSUE OF THE EXCESSIVE FORCE BECAUSE IF WE TAKE THE CIRCUMSTANCE OF. THEIR CHILDREN THE- OFFICER IN THE GEORGE FLOYD CASE HE HAD A HISTORY OF EXCESSIVE FORCE HE DIDN'T HAVE A HISTORY OF THE DEADLY FORCE BUT HE HAD A HISTORY OF THE EXCESSIVE FORCE. AND THAT WAS AVAILABLE UNDER MINNESOTA'S LOSS BECAUSE THOSE RECORDS ARE AVAILABLE HOWEVER WE WOULD NEVER HAVE KNOWN THAT IN UNDER CALIFORNIA'S LAW WE WOULD NOT KNOW THAT ABOUT THAT OFFICER SO THAT WAS THE FEELING THAT THAT WAS A LEGITIMATE PIECE OF INFORMATION FOR PEOPLE IN AND OUT. AND IF WE COMPARE THIS BILL IN OUR CURRENT STATUTE TO THE PUBLIC RECORDS ACT FOR EXAMPLE. IN THE PUBLIC RECORDS ACT MOST AT ALMOST EVERY INFORMATION THAT YOU WOULD REQUEST DOES NOT HAVE TO BE SUSTAINED OR VERIFIED YOU HAVE U. S. THE PUBLIC ART HAVE ACCESS TO THE RECORDS. THAT'S JUST THE WAY THE LAW IS WRITTEN. WELL LIKE FOR INSTANCE I MEAN AND- CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG I MEAN WE'VE HAD THESE NEW PROVISIONS REGARDING- LEGISLATIVE MEMBERS WHERE THINGS DON'T GET RELEASED IF THERE'S NOT A SUSTAINED FINDING. RIGHT ASSEMBLY LIKE COMPARING IT TO OUR OWN SITUATION- THERE pIS A RELEASE A PUBLIC RELEASE IF THERE WAS A SUSTAIN FINDING AGAINST A MEMBER. FOR INSTANCE BUT- AS I UNDERSTAND THERE IS NOT IF THERE IS AN ASSIST IF THERE IS NOT A STAND FOR THIS- SB SIXTEEN AND THE STATUTE THAT'S- IN EFFECT NOW SB FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE. FOR BOTH BASED ON THE PUBLIC RECORDS ACT. WHICH GOVERNMENT NOT ON THE LARA CORRECT ME ON ON YOUR. OKAY YEAH THAT'S ALL THE QUESTIONS THAT I HAVE THANK YOU. FOR THE QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. THANK YOU WE DO HAVE A MOTION IS THEIR SECOND. AND THE SECOND THANK YOU SENATOR YOU MAY CLOSE- THANK YOU VERY MUCH EARNED CHAIR THE LEAGUE OF CITIES DID NOT OPPOSE THE BILL LAST YEAR NOR DID THEY OPPOSE SB FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE SO I FIND IT INTERESTING TO HAVE THEM OPPOSE NOW AND I WONDER IF RECORDS ACT AT THIS POINT- IT WOULD APPEAR THAT SOME OF THEIR OPPOSITION IS DUE TO THE WORK THAT IS INVOLVED IN HAVING TO PRODUCE THESE RECORDS. AND THAT OF COURSE- YES IT IS A ADDITIONAL- BURDEN ON ON- LOCAL GOVERNMENT OR LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES HOWEVER I THINK IT IS ILLEGITIMATE AND WORTHWHILE ONE TO HELP BUILD COMMUNITY TRUST AND TO ENABLE US TO HOLD OUR AGENCIES ACCOUNTABLE AND WITH THAT I ASKED FOR YOUR I. BOATS. THANK YOU SO WE DO HAVE A MOTION AND THAT MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED. TO APPROPRIATIONS CALL THE ROLL PLEASE. STONE AYE STONE AYE GALLAGHER NO GALLAGHER NOTE SHALL. TWO FIVE TWO FIVE DAVIES. GONZALEZ HOLDEN HOLDEN HI KALRA KALRA KILEY MAIENSCHEIN RADIUS REYES AYE. THE BILL NEEDS ONE MORE SO FEDERAL PUT ON CALL. GREAT OKAY ITEM NUMBER FOR SB. THREE FIFTY FOUR. THANK YOU WE DO HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND. THANK YOU- THEN I'LL BE VERY QUICK I WILL JUST INDICATE THAT IF THIS- SB THREE FIFTY FOUR. CREATES A PROCESS FOR A PERSON WITH A PAST CONVICTION TO APPLY FOR AN EXEMPTION IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO BE FOSTER. A FAMILY MEMBER AND THE EXEMPTION PROCESS INVOLVES A THOROUGH ASSESSMENT OF THAT PERSON'S FITNESS TO CARE FOR THE CHILD BECAUSE OF COURSE OUR PRIMARY OBJECTIVE WOULD BE TO ENSURE THAT WE DO NOT ENDANGER CHILDREN. AND THAT IS WHY THE WELFARE- OFFICERS ASSOCIATION IS IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL WITHOUT IT LIKE TO HAVE MY WITNESSES BORN YOUR CORALS FROM STARTING OVER IN KHAKI CENTER LINK FROM THE COUNTY WELFARE DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION. THANK YOU I DO HAVE THOSE TWO WITNESSES ON YOUR QUARRELS AND CATHERINE'S THE NEARLY MCDONALD'S. FOR NEW CORALS ARE YOU ON THE LINE. I CURRENTLY DO NOT SEE RUNNING IT DIALED IN HELLO KATHY CENTER. HER LINE IS OPEN. GREAT THANK YOU HI MISTER CHEN NUMBERS KATHY SANDERLING MADONNA WITH THE COUNTY WELFARE DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION TDB HEARING INCREASE COULD BE A CO SPONSOR OF SB THREE THIRTY FOUR I'M GLAD TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY TO THAT. I FROM THE COUNTY CHILD WELFARE AGENCY PERSPECTIVE THIS BILL IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT WILL HELP COUNTY PLACE MORE CHILDREN WITH RELATIVE CAREGIVERS WHEN THEY COME INTO CARE RESEARCH SHOWS THAT CHILDREN BONTA CHARACTER MUCH BETTER WITH RELATIVES IN GENERAL AND RELATIVES OF THE FIRST PAGE COUNTY TURNS BUT BY LAW AND THAT PRACTICE. AS PART OF THE RESEARCH FAMILY APPROVAL PROCESS WHICH APPLIES TO ALL POTENTIAL CARE GIVERS ANY PERSON LIVING IN A REGULARLY PRESENT IN THE HOME MUST BE BACK ON TRACK ANYONE WITH MORE THAN A MINOR TRAFFIC MARIJUANA AND PASINETTI CAN EXEMPTION OF THE HOME CANNOT BE APPROVED. EXEMPTIONS ARE DONE ON A CASE BY CASE BASIS GRANTED AFTER AN EXTENSIVE REVIEW OF THE CRIME AS LONG AS THE PERSON IS TAKEN SINCE THAT TIME TOO SO THEY HAVE CHANGED AND ARE ABLE TO PROVIDE A SAFE AND LOVING ENVIRONMENT FOR THE CHILD. NOT EVERY EXEMPTION REQUEST IS GRANTED AND APPROVAL OF THE EXEMPTION AND SUBSEQUENT APPROVAL OF THE RESEARCH FAMILY DO NOT GUARANTEE THAT A PARTICULAR. CHILD WILL BE PLACED THEM AT HOME. EVERYTHING HERE TO THE MEDIA HAS SUPPORT AND CO SPONSORED. TO SIMPLIFY AND X. THE AVAILABLE OF EXAM FOR MY CRIMES. AND A CRIME THAT OCCUR IN THE- HOWEVER MANY CURRENT SURVEY NOT ACCEPTABLE. OKAY AN IMPORTANT GUIDED BY A READ APOLLO COURT IS. THAT IS DETAILED YOUR IN OUR- THE DECLARED THE CURRENT PROCESS UNCLE. WHEN IT COMES TO RELATIVES NON RELATED EXTENDED FAMILY MEMBERS. BEING CONSIDERED A POTENTIAL CARE GIVERS CORRECTIVE PERFECT LIMITED CHILD. IN THE COURT RULED THAT SOMEONE CONVICTED A CRIME TO. NOT A UP ALL MY BE GIVEN A CHANCE REQUEST TENSION RECEIVING EXEMPTION. IF THEIR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE CHILD AT THE CAN THAT OF A. CAN YOU CONSIDERING EXEMPTION THE SAME PROVISION IF THAT'LL THAT SUCH A RELATION BECAUSE THAT. THEIR INTERFERE WITH THE TIME. THE RELATIVE AND I IS NOW OF THE REAL. THIS WILL BE AIDED BY THE CHILD AND FAMILY TEAMING PROCESS THAT OCCURRED A CHILD IS BROUGHT INTO CARE. WHICH INCLUDES FAMILY MEMBERS AS WELL AS OTHER TO IMPORTANT IN A CHILD'S LIFE. IMPORTANTLY THE EXEMPTION PROCESS ITSELF WOULD REMAIN AN EXTENSIVE CASE BY CASE PROCESS AND WOULD NOT BE AUTOMATIC. AND AS OF TODAY APPROVAL OF THE RESEARCH FAMILY WOULD NOT GUARANTEE A PARTICULAR PLACEMENT. RIGHT NOW COUNTY SAN TYLER IT COMES TO YOU CONSIDER CERTAIN. OF GIVERS TO RIDICULOUS CHILD EVEN IF THEIR CRIMES OCCURRED LONG AGO AND THEY HAVE CLEARLY CHANGED HAVE THE NEXT SIGNIFICANT EXISTING RELATIONSHIP WITH THE CHILD. THE COURT DECISION MAKES IT CLEAR THAT WE NEED TO CHANGE OUR LAWS TO ALLOW FOR A CASE BY CASE EXEMPTION. COULD BRIEFLY CONSIDERED WHAT A DEEP RELATIONSHIP ALREADY EXISTS BETWEEN THE CHILD AND THE RELATIVES WHO HAS THE POTENTIAL CARE GIVER. TO WTA SUPPORTERS CHANGED AND SB THREE THIRTY FOUR WAS ACTUATED AND A CONSISTENT STATEWIDE MANNER. FOR ALL REASONS WE ARE JUST A PART OF THE BILL IN A AND HAVE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS. THANK YOU. RIGHT IS THERE ANYONE IN THE ROOM WHO LIKE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF SB THREE FIFTY FIVE I BELIEVE THAT FIND IT IS ON THE LINE INTACT MISTER ARE OKAY HIS VENUE FOR WITH THIS. I DO NOT SEE RONNIE OF WIND OUT THEN IF YOU ARE ON THE LINE YOU CAN PRESS STAR ZERO SO WE CAN GATHER YOUR NAME. ONE MOMENT WHILE WE OPEN OUR LINE. HELLO OUR BY NEARBY IS OPEN- THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

A MOTHER WITH CHILDREN PLACED INTO FOSTER CARE. AND A GRANDMOTHER CAPS WITH BRINGING MY GRANDSON HOME. FROM FOSTER CARE. AS A THIRD GENERATION CONVICTED FELONS SYSTEMS ARE NOT NEW TO ME AND THE GENERATIONAL IMPACTS WERE REINFORCED WHEN I HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE ARE THEY PROP THAT. THIRTY YEARS AWAY FROM MY LASTING CAR SERRATION THE BEST DID USE OF MY CONVICTIONS. THE COLLATERAL CONSEQUENCES OF INCARCERATION SET THE STAGE FOR AND OVER TWO HUNDRED THEY ARE ESTATE PROCESS. I HAD BEEN IN MY GRANDSON'S LIFE FROM DAY ONE. HE WAS TAKEN FROM HIS MOTHER AT COURT WHEN HE WAS SIX MONTHS OLD HE WAS RIPPED AWAY FROM EVERYONE HE KNEW. AND FROM EVERYONE THAT KNEW AND LOVED HIM NEED TO CALL CALL ON HIS UNCLES. COUSINS I REMEMBER WHEN I WAS THE KID OUT I USED TO WONDER WHAT I HAD DONE WRONG THE FIRST TIME THAT I WAS PLACED IN FOSTER CARE. AS AN ADULT I KNOW IT IS NEVER THE CHILD'S FAULT. I BELIEVE THAT SB THREE FIFTY FOUR WILL GIVE CHILDREN THE BENEFIT OF AN INDIVIDUALIZED ASSESSMENT BEFORE MAKING PLACEMENT DECISIONS. MAKING DECISIONS TO PLACE CHILDREN OUTSIDE OF FAMILY ESPECIALLY WHEN FAMILY BONDS IN RELATIONSHIPS ARE IN PLACE. SEVERAL FAMILIES IN A WAY THAT HARMS OUR CHILDREN. I HAVE NO POWER TO CHANGE THE PAST. ALL I HAVE IS IT DAY. TO DENY CHILDREN PLACEMENT OR DRAG OUT THE ART THEY PROCESS BECAUSE OF IT WERE BOOKABLE PASS THAT HAVE NO NEXUS TO A PERSON'S ABILITY TO LOVE AND CARE FOR PROTECT. A RELATIVE OR NON RELATIVE EXTENDED FAMILY MEMBER IS A STRONG SENTENCE. I DON'T SPEAK PROJECT MYSELF. THIS IS A MAN IN THERE IS THERE ARE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE HERE IN CALIFORNIA LIKE ME.

THESE RESULTS SENATE BILL FOR SIXTY ONE WHICH WILL EMBRACE CONSUMER PROTECTION I'M SORRY ENHANCE CONSUMER PROTECTION AND FAIR COMPETITION ENFORCEMENT BY ALLOWING- THE AUTHORITY OF LARGE COUNTY COUNCIL OFFICES WITH THE PRE EXISTING AUTHORITY OF THEIR CITY. ATTORNEY COUNTY COUNTERPARTS CALIFORNIA'S UNFAIR COMPETITION LAW. ALLOWS THE ATTORNEY GENERAL DISTRICT ATTORNEYS AND CITY ATTORNEYS OF CITIES WITH A POPULATION OF OVER SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND THE AUTHORITY BRING CIVIL ACTION AGAINST NEWBIES BUSINESS PRACTICES HOWEVER COUNTY COUNCILS DO NOT HAVE THE SAME AUTHORITY. BY GIVING THE STATE'S THREE LARGEST COUNTY COUNCIL OFFICES LOS ANGELES SAN DIEGO AND SANTA CLARA THE AUTHORITY TO BRING YOU SEE ALL ACTIONS SB FOUR SIXTY ONE WILL CLOSE AN EXISTING FORCED ME GAP. IN ENABLE THESE COUNTY COUNCILS TO BETTER PROTECT CONSUMERS IMPROVE AND PROMOTE FAIR COMPETITION. THE BILL ALSO ALIGNS WITH OTHER IMPORTANT CONSUMER PROTECTION STATUTES IN CALIFORNIA SUCH AS THE FALSE ADVERTISING LAW WHICH BROADLY AUTHORIZES COUNTY COUNCILS TO COMBAT DECEPTIVE BUSINESS PRACTICES SB FOUR SIXTY ONE IS COSPONSORED BY SANTA CLARA AND LOS ANGELES COUNTIES IN SUPPORT OF BY THE LOS ANGELES DISTRICT ATTORNEY. CONSUMER ATTORNEYS AND CONSUMER FEDERATION SEIU CALIFORNIA THE URBAN COUNTIES OF CALIFORNIA AND EARTHJUSTICE HERE TO TESTIFY TODAY IS JAMES WILLIAMS. SANTA CLARA COUNTY COUNCIL AND ROD CASTRO SILVA LOS ANGELES COUNTY COUNCIL RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR RIVAL THANK YOU. THANK YOU CENTER WE DO HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND I HAVE THOSE TWO WITNESSES LISTED JAMES WILLIAMS AND ROD CASTRO SILVA JAMES WILLIAMS ARE YOU ON THE LINE. GOOD AFTERNOON CAN YOU HEAR ME YES GO AHEAD PLEASE. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN STONE HONORABLE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS JAMES WILLIAMS ON THE COUNTY COUNCIL FOR THE COUNTY OF SANTA CLARA. SANTA CLARA COUNTY URGES THE COMMITTEE TO SUPPORT SB FOUR SIXTY ONE THE BILL OF THE NARAL LEGISLATIVE PROPOSAL THAT WOULD ALIGN THE AUTHORITY OF THE THREE LARGEST COUNTY COUNCIL OFFICES LOS ANGELES SAN DIEGO AND SANTA CLARA. WITH THE CORRECT AUTHORITIES THERE CITY ATTORNEY COUNTERPARTS TO BRING UNFAIR COMPETITION LAW CASES. I NEED HELP ALREADY HAVE SOME AUTHORITY UNDER ANOTHER KEY CONSUMER PROTECTION STATUTE FALSE ADVERTISING LAW. YET WITHOUT UCL AUTHORITY ARE OFF YOU CANNOT BRING UNFAIR COMPETITION FALSE ADVERTISING LAW CASES TOGETHER CREATING SIGNIFICANT INEFFICIENCIES. FURTHER THIS MISALIGNMENT MCCARTY HAMSTRINGS OUR ABILITY TO PROTECT CONSUMERS WHEN STATEWIDE CONSUMER PROTECTION NEEDS WORK THE RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO ADDRESS THEM. OUR OFFICES ARE THE LARGEST AND STATE HAVE STRONG REPUTATIONS AND TRACK RECORDS AND HAVE THE RESOURCES AND EXPERIENCE TO LITIGATE OFTEN LONG TO COMPLEX CONSUMER PROTECTION CASES. FOR EXAMPLE THE SANTA CLARA COUNTY COUNSEL'S OFFICE HAS BEEN LITIGATED CONSUMER PROTECTION CASES FOR DECADES. YOU TO THAT LITIGATION IN THE QUALITY OF THE WORK CONDUCTED BY ATTORNEYS OFFICE RECEIVED THE AMERICAN BAR ASSOCIATION'S AWARD FOR OUTSTANDING PERFORMANCE BY PUBLIC. SECTOR LAW OFFICE TWENTY NINETEEN. FURTHER OFFICE PROVIDING LEGAL TO PROVIDE A WIDE RANGE OF CRITICAL SERVICES ACROSS OUR COUNTIES WE HAVE A KEEN SENSE OF COMMUNITY NEEDS THE LIGHT AT THE HEART CONSUMER PROTECTION EFFORTS. AND OUR OFFICES HAVE A GREAT HISTORY OF JURISDICTIONAL COOPERATION AS OUR LEAD PAYTON COPYRIGHT LITIGATION CHAU. AS THE COMMITTEE COUNSEL EXPORT ANALYSIS EXPLAINS SB FOUR SIXTY ONE DISTRICT COURT PROPOSAL THAT WILL ADVANCE CONSUMER PROTECTIONS FOR COMPETITION ACROSS THE STATE. BY ALIGNING THE AUTHORITY OF LARGE POPULATIONS HEALTH COUNCILS WITH THE PURPOSE AND STRUCTURE OF THE UNFAIR COMPETITION LAW. I HOPE YOU WILL SUPPORT IT AT THE END THREE QUESTIONS YOU HAVE TO HEAR FROM MY LOS ANGELES COUNTY COUNCIL COLLEAGUES. THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU WHO RIDE CASTRO SILVA. YES CAN YOU HEAR ME YES WE CAN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN STONE AND ARE RESPONSIBLE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE- MY NAME IS RODRIGO CASTRO SILVA AND ON THE COUNTY COUNCIL FOR LOS ANGELES COUNTY. THE L. A. COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS IS PROUD TO CO SPONSOR AT THE FOUR SIXTY ONE AND WE ASK YOU TO SUPPORT THIS BILL. SB FOUR SIXTY ONE WILL ELIMINATE BARRIERS THAT SEVERELY LIMIT MY OFFICE'S ABILITY TO PURSUE UNFAIR COMPETITION CASES TO PROTECT CONSUMERS AND LAW ABIDING BUSINESSES. WE HAVE THE EXPERTISE TO PURSUE THESE MATTERS ON A TRACK RECORD OF SUCCESSFULLY LITIGATING COMPLEX FALSE ADVERTISING CONSUMER AND ENVIRONMENTAL CASES. THIS BILL WILL EXPAND OUR ABILITY TO PURSUE THAT IMPORTANT WORK. L. A. COUNTY AS THE PRIMARY PROVIDER SAFETY NET SERVICES FOR OVER TEN MILLION PEOPLE ARE COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AND BUSINESS AFFAIRS FIELD INVESTIGATES CONSUMER COMPLAINTS INVOLVING FORMER POPULATIONS. INCLUDING THE ELDERLY VETERANS IMMIGRANTS AND THOSE EXPERIENCING POVERTY INDEED IN TWENTY TWENTY THE CAN RECEIVED OVER EIGHTY FIVE HUNDRED CONSUMER COMPLAINT. NOT HAVING FULL AUTHORITY UNDER THE UNFAIR COMPETITION LAW HAS LIMITED OUR ABILITY TO PROTECT CONSUMERS AND LIMITED OUR OPTIONS ON IMPORTANT ISSUES LIKE ENVIRONMENTAL AND PUBLIC HEALTH MATTERS. FOR EXAMPLE THE EXITE FACILITY IN VERNON OPERATED UNLAWFULLY PROTECTED RELEASING LEAD INTO THE COMMUNITY AND IMPACTING PUBLIC HEALTH. OUR LEGAL OPTIONS WERE LIMITED BECAUSE EXCITED NOT IN THE UNINCORPORATED AREA OF THE COUNTY AND WAS NOT VIOLATING A COUNTY BOARD. IFSB FOUR SIXTY ONE HAD BEEN THE LAW YEARS AGO WE COULD HAVE TAKEN ACTION AGAINST EXIDE. PROVIDING STATE AND FEDERAL ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS SB FOUR SIXTY ONE CAN HELP US PROTECT IMPACT IMPACTED COMMUNITIES AND PREVENT ANOTHER ENVIRONMENTAL INJUSTICE LIKE EXCITE. RECOGNIZING AN UNMET NEED MY OFFICE ESTABLISHED IN AFFIRMATIVE LITIGATION AND CONSUMER PROTECTION DIVISION WHICH IS STAFFED WITH FIFTEEN EXPERIENCED ATTORNEYS. MANY FROM OTHER PUBLIC PROSECUTOR OFFICES. AS A FORMER FEDERAL PROSECUTOR I UNDERSTAND THE VALUE OF THAT EXPERIENCE AND BEING ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY LITIGATE THESE TYPES OF CASES.

FOUR SIXTY ONE I WAS ON THE LINE BUT I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU COULDN'T HEAR ME- PREVIOUSLY ON MAC ON YES PLEASE DO. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH I'M A DEPUTY DSTRICT ATTORNEY IN MONTEREY COUNTY AND WORKED FOR THE PAST TEN YEARS IN MY OFFICE IS CONSUMER AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION UNIT I AM SPEAKING TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION AND I ALONG WITH CDA RESPECTFULLY ASK YOU TO VOTE NO ON S. P. FOR SIXTY ONE. CDA RESPECTABLE PLAYED BY COUNTY COUNCIL AND WE WHOLEHEARTEDLY BELIEVE IN THE GOAL OF ENHANCING CONSUMER PROTECTION HOWEVER WE BELIEVE THAT THIS BILL SOLVE THE PROBLEM DOES NOT EXIST IN WILL CREATE OTHER PROBLEMS THAT WILL PROTEST. THE UNFAIR COMPETITION LAW IS THE KEY ENFORCEMENT TOOL USED TO COMBAT CONSUMER FRAUD IN CALIFORNIA IT IS AN INCREDIBLY BROAD STATUTE THAT ALLOWS FOR CIVIL PENALTIES AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AGAINST COMMERCIAL ACTIVITY THAT VIOLATES NOT ONLY STATE STATUTES BUT EVERY OTHER RULE REGULATION ORDER AN ORDINANCE PROMULGATED BY EVERY LEVEL OF GOVERNMENT AND GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES. THE POWER GRANTED BY THE UCL WITH EXTENDED EVEN FURTHER JUST LAST YEAR WHEN THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT HELD THAT THE UCL IS NOT LIMITED BY THE GEOGRAPHIC BOUNDARIES OF THE COUNTY MEANING THAT EACH DISTRICT ATTORNEY CAN EFFECTIVELY SEEK STATEWIDE PENALTIES AND RELIEF FOR CONDUCT OCCURRING OUTSIDE OF THEIR JURISDICTION. SB PORT SIXTY ONE WOULD ALLOW THREE UNELECTED COUNTY COUNCIL TO CIVILIANS FORCED NOT ONLY A BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS CODE BUT THE PENAL CODE AS WELL AS ANY OTHER RULE OR STATUTE THE DECLARE SOME AFTER A COURSE OF CONDUCT TO BE UNLAWFUL THIS MEANS THAT UNELECTED COUNTY COUNCIL WILL EFFECTIVELY HAVE A CIVIL LAW ENFORCEMENT POWER EQUAL TO THAT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. THIS IS PARTICULARLY CONCERNING BECAUSE THESE COUNTY COUNCIL HAVE AT TIMES CONTRACTED OUT AFFIRMATIVE LITIGATION WORK. TO PRIVATE CONTINGENCY FEE COUNCIL. THIS CREATED AND HAN EVEN. BY GIVING EXTREMELY BROAD LAW ENFORCEMENT POWERS TWO ATTORNEYS THAT HAVE A PECUNIARY STAKE IN THE OUTCOME OF THE LITIGATION. PROSECUTORIAL NEUTRALITY IS THE CORNERSTONE OF THE UCL AND THE PRACTICE OF USING CONTINGENCY COUNCIL THREATENS TO UNDERMINE THE PUBLIC'S FAITH IN UCL ENFORCEMENT. IN SHORT THIS MEANS THAT THESE UNELECTED COUNTY COUNCIL COULD CONTRACT WITH CONTINGENCY FEE COUNCIL AND SET A LARGE UCL CASES ON BEHALF OF THE ENTIRE STATE. LASTLY THIS BILL SEEKS TO FILL A GAP THAT DOES NOT EXIST DOES COUNTY WOULD BE AFFECTED ALREADY HAD CITIES WITH POPULATIONS IN EXCESS OF SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND. EACH OF WHICH HAS INDEPENDENT UCL DAUGHERTY MORE IMPORTANTLY EACH ALREADY HAS AN ELECTED DISTRICT ATTORNEY WITH FULL UCL AUTHORITY. I CAN SAY FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE THAT THE CONSUMER PROTECTION UNIT THAT EACH OF THE URBAN COUNTIES IN THE STATE ARE AMONG THE VERY BEST IN TERMS OF QUALITY OF WORK INVOLVED IN THE CASE IS. ACTING AS A BACKSTOP TO ALL OF US IS THE CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY GENERAL WHICH ITSELF HAS A ROBUST CONSUMER LAW SECTION THAT PURSUED CASES AROUND THE STATE. IN CONCLUSION WE BELIEVE THIS WILL SOLVE THE PROBLEM THAT DOES NOT EXIST WELL CREATING OTHER CIVIL PROCESS. WE ASK YOU TO VOTE NOW THANK YOU. THANK YOU. RIGHT OPERATOR ANYONE ELSE. THANK YOU I HAVE NO FURTHER COMMENTS THANK YOU. RIGHT THANK YOU MAY CLOSE THE LINES ARE BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS PLEASE CONSULT. I'M A LITTLE CONFUSED BY THE OPPOSITION AND CORRECT ME IF I'M I COULD HAVE THIS WRONG. THE CITY OF SAN JOSE HAS AN UNELECTED CITY ATTORNEY. IS THAT CORRECT THAT'S CORRECT THE SILICON CURRENTLY UTILIZE. THIS PROVISION ALREADY YES OKAY HE'S THE OF THESE THESE TYPES OF ACTIONS- ON FOOT- THESE- FOR COMPETITION ACTIONS CAN BE BROUGHT BY THE CITY ATTORNEYS IN THE DA'S THE ATTORNEY GENERAL IT'S JUST COUNTY COUNCIL SO CLEARLY THIS ALREADY EXIST FOR A POSITION THAT'S ON ELECTED PER SE BUT HAS THAT THERE IS A LACK COULD INFLUENCE TO SAY THE LEAST OVER IT ASSEMBLY MEMBER- THAT I'M GLAD YOU PICKED UP ON THAT POINT I THINK ALL OF US WHO SERVED LOCAL GOVERNMENT NO OR INTERACTED WITH LITTLE GOVERNMENT KNOW. THAT COUNTY COUNCILS- ENGAGE THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS TYPICALLY IN A CLOSED SESSION ENVIRONMENT UNDER UNDER THE CALIFORNIA BROWN ACT- ASKED FOR DIRECTION TO- TO FILE AN ACTION LIKE THIS SO THAT DIRECTIONS COMING NOT ONLY FROM AN ELECTED OFFICIAL BUT FROM A MAJORITY OF THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS OR DOESN'T PROCEED- AND- AND- BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY- IT YOU KNOW AT THAT POINT THEY CAN MOVE FORWARD IMMEDIATELY AND I THINK REALLY THIS IS NOT. TAKING AWAY ANYTHING FROM ANY OTHER OFFICE- THIS IS A BOTH AND OR IN AN ALL IN TYPE OF A SCENARIO WHERE IF FOR THE A IN ONE OF THESE THREE COUNTIES- IS AT CAPACITY- AND THAT BOARD OF SUPERVISORS SAYS LEAP INTO ACTION RIGHT NOW PEOPLE ARE BEING HURT RIGHT NOW WHAT THEY WANT IT IS THE COUNTY COUNCIL VOTED TO GO INTO COURT AND FILE FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF FOR WHATEVER HE OR SHE NEEDS TO DO IMMEDIATELY- AND NOT BE SEEKING- OR GETTING IN LINE AT THE DA'S OFFICE ON NOT TO SAY THAT THE DA'S OFFICE. IS CAUSING PROBLEMS OR DOING ANYTHING- BUT GREAT WORK I THINK IN ALL THESE KINDS OF HISTORY SPEAK FOR COUNTY THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO REASON TO PUT A COUNTY COUNSEL'S OFFICE ON THE SIDELINES LIKE THE ONE IN SANTA CLARA COUNTY FOR EXAMPLE WHICH IS- A CLAIM TO BE ONE OF THE TOP. COUNTY COUNCIL OFFICES IN THE COUNTRY IS PURSUED WHAT PAINT HAS PURSUED THE OPEN. ISSUE AND IS DONE IT. A WITHOUT COLLEGE YOU KNOW- IN ENGINE THAT'S WHAT THEY DO THEY CREATE. BIG IMPACT LITIGATION UNITS IN IN THESE COUNTY COUNCIL OFFICES- AND- YOU KNOW FRANKLY THE BLIND. AFTER EVEN NOT NATIONAL LEADERSHIP OVER THE PAST FOUR YEARS I THINK HER WHERE THE- I UNDER THIS STATUTE RIGHT. HE'LL IMMENSELY FOR THIS BILL I HAVING SPENT A LOT OF TIME OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS DEALING WITH THIS CODE IN YOU KNOW IT WAS REPLACED IT WAS PLACE WE UTILIZE THIS IN A DIFFERENT STATUTE AND- SEEN THE WAY THE INTERACTIONS OF VARIOUS CITY ATTORNEYS IN SAN JOSE VERSUS WHAT A SANTA CLARA COUNTY MIGHT HAVE CHOSEN TO DO- THE DA OF SAN FRANCISCO VERSUS WHAT A SAN DIEGO DA- DID NOT DO. CITY ATTORNEY IN SAN DIEGO SO EIGHT IT I THINK LIKE YOU THE MORE IN A SITUATION LIKE THIS WHERE YOU HAVE THE CAPACITY THE BETTER I ALSO WANT TO THANK YOU FOR LEAVING SAN DIEGO AND THAT I HEARD- SOME. POSITION OF NEUTRALITY THAT THEY WEREN'T GOING TO UTILIZE THE STATUTE AND- I CAN GUARANTEE I HAD A VERY LONG CONVERSATION WITH THE- CHAIR OF THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS LAST NIGHT NIGHT I THINK MAYBE MAYBE. MAYBE IT WILL OUR COULD BE UTILIZED- BY THE COUNTY I DON'T THINK THERE WAS A- A CLEAR INDICATION FROM FROM THE MAJORITY OF THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS THAT THIS WOULD NOT BE UTILIZED IN SAN DIEGO SO- I JUST WANNA THANK YOU I THINK IT'S A GREAT DEAL AND- I. IS THAT MOVED I WILL MOVE IT IF NOT. THANK YOU SO MUCH. AND HOW IT IS NOT A VALID DITTO TO WHAT A SUMMER GONZALEZ SAID- CENTER CORTESE AND THAT KIND OF A THIS IS ADDITIVE IT'S AN ADDITIONAL MEASURE TO ALLOW- INFORM FOR- ACTION THAT CAN BE TAKEN TO YOUR POINT- AND REALLY TO- SOME OF HIS OFFICE PLANS WELL THAT. YOU KNOW THE END OF THE DAY YOU KNOW THERE THERE ARE A VARIETY OF ELECTED POSITIONS AND THEY TAKE DIFFERENT ROLES OR OR TAKE A DIFFERENT VIEW OF WHAT THE ROLE IS AT THE END IF YOU HAVE A SITUATION WHERE A MAJORITY OF THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS FEELS THAT ACTION IS NECESSARY. I THINK THAT THAT THAT'S A PRETTY STRONG INDICATION. THAT THERE SHOULD BE ACTION TAKEN AT THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S NOT FOREVER REASON NOT WILLING TO TAKE CARE OF THEIR OVER BURDENED WITH WORK WHATEVER MAY BE- I THINK THAT THE COUNTY COUNCIL UNDER THE DIRECTION OF THOSE. ELECTED TO POSITION OTHER OPPORTUNITIES THANK YOU. THERE OU SUMMER. I% RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR IDOL THANK YOU.

RIGHT THANK YOU I DO HAVE THOSE TWO WITNESSES HEIDI SANBORN AND MICHAEL DAFT HEIDI SANBORN ARE YOU WITH US. I AM CARE GO AHEAD THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU KAREN MEMBERS MY NAME IS AGAIN ID SANBORN EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE NATIONAL SEARCH BACKING COUNCIL A NONPROFIT THAT ADVOCATES FOR CIRCULAR ECONOMY WHERE CO SPONSOR SB THREE FOUR THREE. I THOUGHT THE PRIVILEGE OF SERVING AS CHAIR OF THE STATEWIDE COMMISSION ON REFLECTING MARKET MAKERS START RECYCLING A GROUP OF SEVENTEEN DIVERSE STAKEHOLDERS TO REPRESENT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WASTE HAULERS NGOS RECYCLERS AND MORE IT IS TASKED WITH PROVIDING ADVICE ON HOW TO REDUCE CONTAMINATION IN CALIFORNIA'S RECYCLING STREAM. THE COMMISSION HAS ALREADY RELEASED YOUR REPORT AND THIRTY UNANIMOUSLY SUPPORTED POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE LEGISLATURE THIRTEEN OF WHICH HAVE ALREADY RESULTED IN ACTION BY THE STATE SB THREE FOUR THREE THE BASE POLICY RECOMMENDATION NUMBER FIFTEEN WHICH RECOMMENDS TRUTHFUL LABELING TO REDUCE CONTAMINATION AND IMPROVE RECYCLING AND RECEIVED UNANIMOUS CONSENSUS AMONG THE SEVENTEEN- COMMISSIONERS. THE CHECKING OUR ASSEMBLE IS THE UNIVERSAL SYMBOL FOR RESPECTABILITY A COMPANIES ARE CURRENTLY ALLOWED TO PLACE SYMBOL ON PRODUCTS THAT CANNOT BE RECYCLED. SUCH AS BAGS IN SOLO CUPS. THIS CREATES CAN THAT WE DRESS TO. DURING THINGS AWAY THAT ARE NON RECYCLED FULL PACKAGES IN THE RECYCLING STREAM. THEREBY CONTAMINATING RECYCLABLES AND INCREASING SORTING COSTS THAT ARE BORNE BY RATEPAYERS. ACCORDING TO THE CONSUMER BRANDS ASSOCIATION- REPORT REDUCE REUSE AND CONFUSE. ONLY 4% OF U. S. RESPONDENTS SAID THE RECYCLING IS NOT CONFUSING. WHAT DO THE RIGHT THING BUT THEY FEEL LIED TO WHEN THEY LEARNED THAT SOME OF THESE PRODUCTS AND PACKAGING THAT BEAR THE CHASING ASSEMBLE ARE NOT RECYCLABLE AND THEY GET MAD AT GOVERNMENT FOR ALLOWING THESE COMPANIES TO USE THIS DECEPTIVE LABELING. SB THREE FOUR THREE WILL STOP TO TRANSLATE LYING AND ALLOW CONSUMERS TO MAKE INFORMED PURCHASING DECISIONS BASED ON THE RECYCLABILITY OF THE ITEMS THEY PURCHASE AND CALIFORNIA SHOULD NOT BE BEHOLDEN TO LAWS IN OTHER STATES THAT ALLOW CONFUSING AND MISLEADING LABELING. CALIFORNIANS DEMAND THE TRUTH AND WE MUST SLEEP AND AS A NATIONAL OGANIZATION THE NATIONAL SEARCH BACKING COUNCIL IS COMMITTED TO HELPING AND IS RIVER ROAD THE CHASING ARROWS REQUIREMENTS AND OTHER STATES AND CREATE A ROLE THAT HARMONIZE. AND THAT IS WHAT WE ALL DESIRE THANK YOU. THANK YOU N. SENATORS SINCE YOU DID TOO MUCH FOR PRESENTATION THERE ARE AMENDMENTS. THAT ARE LISTED YOUR THINKING THOSE OF A YES I AM ABSOLUTELY ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS AND I THINK THE COMMITTEE FOR ITS WORK. THANK YOU THANK YOU ALL RIGHT MICHAEL DAFT WHO'S WITH US IN PERSON. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR MEMBERS MICHAEL DAFT WITH THE FAMILY ON BEHALF OF REPUBLIC SERVICES. A LEADING AWAY SERVICES PROVIDER IN THE NATION. THIS MEASURE IS A AS MUCH ABOUT TRUTH IN ADVERTISING AS IT IS ABOUT IMPROVING CALIFORNIA'S RECYCLING SYSTEM CALIFORNIA'S RECYCLING INFRASTRUCTURE IS ONE OF THE MOST EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT RECYCLING SYSTEMS IN THE WORLD. BUT IN SPITE OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS BEING INVESTED INTO THE INFRASTRUCTURE TO IMPROVE RECYCLING CONTAMINATION REMAINS ONE OF OUR MOST DIFFICULT AND EXPENSIVE OBSTACLES. SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE IN MANUAL SORT LINES OPTICAL SORTERS SCREENS SHREDDER'S BLOWERS AND OTHER ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES. BUT THESE TECHNOLOGIES AND EQUIPMENT ARE FAR MORE EXPENSIVE THAN CONSUMER EDUCATION. AND EFFECTIVE SOURCE SEPARATION. LOCAL JURISDICTIONS AND THEIR LOCAL HAULERS SPEND HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ANNUALLY EDUCATE OUR CUSTOMERS ON WHAT IS RECYCLABLE IN AN EFFORT TO IMPROVE RECYCLING RATES AND REDUCE CONTAMINATION AND RECYCLING COSTS. BUT THOSE DOLLARS ARE WASTED IF PACKAGING MATERIALS INCLUDE MARKINGS THAT FALSELY CLAIM THOSE PACKAGES OR MATERIALS ARE RECYCLABLE. THESE LABELS CONFUSE CONSUMERS AND MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT TO CORRECTLY IDENTIFY WHICH SHOULD BE PLACED IN THE BLUE RECYCLING BIN. AS AN EXAMPLE WELL PLASTIC FILM IS A CHEAP PACKAGING OPTION IT CONSTITUTES LESS THAN SMALL PERCENTAGE OF WASTE ACCOUNTS FOR A MAJORITY OF PROBLEMS COMING UP OUR MACHINERY CREATING LETTER PROBLEMS AND INCREASING THE COST OF RECYCLING OVERALL BY ATTEMPTING TO REMOVE THEM FROM OUR WASTE STREAM. CONSUMERS SHOULD NOT BE LED TO BELIEVE THAT THESE BAGS ARE TRULY RECYCLABLE UNLESS MARKETS EXIST. SB THREE FORTY THREE SETS IN THE ACTIVE IN CLEAR STANDARD FOR RECYCLABILITY. THAT WILL INCREASE RECYCLING EFFICIENCIES IMPROVE CONFIDENCE IN RECYCLING. AND WILL REDUCE RECYCLING COSTS FOR RATEPAYERS LOCAL JURISDICTIONS AND RECYCLERS WE ASK THAT YOU PLEASE VOTE I'D ON SENATE BILL THREE FORTY THREE THANK YOU. THANK YOU. RIGHT WILL NOW MOVE TO OTHERS WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF SB THREE FORTY THREE IS THERE ANYONE. IN THE HEARING ROOM.

SUSTAINABILITY IS A PRIMARY FOCUS OF OUR MEMBERS IN OUR SOCIO HAITIAN OUR MEMBERS ARE INTENT ON USING RECYCLED CONTENT AND CREATING AND MARKET SO THAT LESS MATERIAL GOES TO LANDFILLS. I'M TESTIFYING TO EXPRESS OUR CONCERNS WITH SB THREE FORTY THREE BECAUSE IT WILL LIMIT STRONG AND VIABLE RECYCLING MARKETS IN THE STATE SPECIFICALLY OF PT THERMOFORMED POLYPROPYLENE. WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH SENATOR ALLEN'S OFFICE FOR SEVERAL YEARS ON SB FIFTY FOUR TO CREATE A BROADER SOLUTION TO IMPROVE RECYCLING MARKETS IN THE STATE WILL HOPE TO CONTINUE THESE CONVERSATIONS BECAUSE WE BELIEVE MORE PLASTICS. SHOULD BE RECYCLED IN THE STATE NOT LESS. SB THREE FORTY THREE HAS STARTED A LONG OVERDUE AN IMPORTANT CONVERSATION ON THE RISEN RESIN IDENTIFICATION CODE OR THE RISK. THE CURRENT STANDARD DICTATES THIS COACH SHOULD BE PLACED INSIDE A TRIANGLE AND DISPLAYED INCONSPICUOUSLY ON BOTTLES AND RIGID PLASTIC CONTAINERS. UNFORTUNATELY TWENTY NINE STATES STILL REQUIRE THE CODE BE PLACED INSIDE THREE CHASING ARROWS. CREATING SIGNIFICANT CONSUMER- CONFUCIAN. CLASSICS IS COMMITTED TO WORKING- TO SUPPORT EFFORTS IN THESE TWENTY NINE STATES TO FOLLOW CALIFORNIA'S LEAD. AND UPDATE THEIR CODES. WE SINCERELY APPRECIATE THE AUTHORS AMENDMENT WHICH ALLOWS OUR INDUSTRY ADDITIONAL TIME TO WORK WITH THESE OTHER STATES. AND OUR MEMBERS ADDITIONAL IME TO COMPLY BY UPDATING THEIR MOLDS. WE'RE STILL VERY CONCERNED REGARDING THE LANGUAGE OF THIS LEGISLATION THAT USES THE SAME CRITERIA- THAT WE JUST SAW COME OUT OF CALIFORNIA COMMISSION ON RECYCLING MARKETS IN CURBSIDE RECYCLING. THAT LIST ONLY P. ET IN HDPE BOTTLES AS RECYCLABLES. PT THERMAL FORMS A CLAM SHELLS WHICH PACKED SO MUCH OF CALIFORNIA'S FRESH PRODUCE. WOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED RECYCLABLE AND WOULDN'T NEITHER WOULD POLYPROPYLENE WHICH HAS MATERIAL QUALITIES. MAKING IT THE PREFERRED RESIN FOR A VARIETY OF FOOD AND SAFETY PRODUCTS. THIS CHAMBER ALSO RECENTLY PASSED A BEFORE SEVENTY EIGHT WHICH REQUIRES RECYCLED CONTENT IN PLASTIC THERMOFORMED. HOWEVER THE BILL BEFORE YOU WOULD DEEM THOSE ITEMS NON RECYCLABLE AND THEY WOULD BE LANDFILLS. MAKING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF AB FOUR SEVENTY EIGHT IMPOSSIBLE. REAL IMPROVEMENTS CAN ONLY BE ACHIEVED BY AN EMPHASIS ON DEVELOPING AN MARKETS WHICH IS WHY WE SUPPORT. CONTINUED WORK ON SB FIFTY FOUR AS AMORE COMPREHENSIVE SOLUTION TO ADDRESS THE RECYCLING CENTER CONCERTS IN THE STATE. IS CURRENTLY WRITTEN SB THREE FORTY THREE WILL REDUCE REAL RECYCLING N THE STATE. HOWEVER WE LOOK FORWARD THERE ARE CONTINUED WORK WITH SENATOR ALLEN AND HIS STAFF ON SOLUTIONS TO MAKE THIS BILL WORKABLE. AND HELP IMPROVE RECYCLING. THANK YOU. THANK YOU.
