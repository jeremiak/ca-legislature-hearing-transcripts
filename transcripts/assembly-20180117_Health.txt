OFFERS WILL THANK EVERYBODY FOR BEING HERE OF VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THAT. GOOD AFTERNOON AND WELCOME TO THE THIRD IN A SERIES OF HEARINGS OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON HEALTHCARE DELIVERY SYSTEMS AND UNIVERSAL COVERAGE. WE SPEND MORE THAN TWENTY HOURS IN THESE HEARINGS ARE LEARNING FROM HEALTH CARE EXPERTS AND WE WILL LIKELY SPEND ANOTHER TWENTY HOURS LEARNING EVEN MORE. THESE HOURS WERE FAR EXCEED THE ATTENTION THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE HAS REESE WOULD HAVE RECEIVED A SINGLE POLICY HEARING OF THE ASSEMBLY HEALTH COMMITTEE. AND I MAKE NO APOLOGIES FOR THAT. WE ARE RESPONSIBILITY MAKE SURE THAT THE RECOMMENDATIONS WE INTEND TO PUBLISH TO SPRING COULD PROVIDE A PATHWAY TO HEALTH CARE. FOR EVERYONE WHO CALLS CALIFORNIA HOME. THIS HEARING WILL FOCUS ON ACCESS TO CARE AND UNDERSTANDING HEALTH CARE PRICING. PROVIDING COVERAGE IS NOT THE SAME AS PROVIDING CARE WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT ANY SYSTEM THAT HAS THE HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS WE NEED. WE'VE TO HAS THEM WHERE WE NEED THEM AND. WE HAVE HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS AND WHERE WE NEED THEM TO BE. WHETHER YOUR PHYSICIAN HOSPITAL A HOSPITAL NURSE NURSE PRACTITIONER DENTIST MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDER. YOU MUST BE REIMBURSED FAIRLY FOR THE CARRY PROVIDE WITHOUT THAT WILL CONTINUE TO STRUGGLE TO HAVE ENOUGH PROVIDERS ESPECIALLY IN RURAL COMMUNITIES TO MEET THE NEED. WE ALSO NEED TO UNDERSTAND ALL OF THE COST DRIVERS AND FIND WAYS TO BALANCE COSTS WITH THE BENEFITS AND WE PROVIDE. TODAY WILL BE. HAVE JOINING A SPEAKERS FROM THE CALIFORNIA HEALTHCARE FOUNDATION GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY. VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY THE KAISER FAMILY FOUNDATION THE UCSF SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AND STANFORD UNIVERSITY. WE WILL AT THE ALLOWING UP WE WILL HAVE PUBLIC COMMENT AT THE END OF. TODAY'S OF PROCEEDINGS WERE APT TO AFTER A PANELS. I KNOW WE HAVE MANY PASSIONATE PEOPLE IN THE AUDIENCE WOULD LIKE TO ENSURE THE PUBLIC COMMENT. PERIOD WILL GIVE. CHANCE FOR PEOPLE TO SPEAK. ENCOURAGE EVERYONE TO BE RESPECTFUL AT DURING THAT TIME IN THE COMMENTS WILL BE LIMITED TO TWO MINUTES EACH. MORE DETAILED WRITTEN COMMENTS ARE WELCOME AND THEY CAN BE SUBMITTED TO THE COMMITTEE FOR. FOR THE PUBLIC RECORD. I AM I WOULD LIKE TO SAY IN THE PROCEEDINGS TODAY THAT WE ASK THAT THERE'S NO. NO APPLAUSE NO BOOS CATCALLS ANYTHING LIKE THAT THIS IS A AND A DIFFERENCE THE SPEAKERS SO THAT WE CAN. CONDUCTOR PROCEEDINGS WITH MINIMAL INTERRUPTIONS AND I ASK YOU TO RESPECT THAT PLEASE. I'D LIKE TO NOW TURN THIS OVER TO. MY CO CHAIR A DOCTOR WALKING AROUND THE LEFT TO OFFER ANY OPENING COMMENTS I GUESS I SHOULD INTRODUCE MYSELF I'M JIM WOOD CHAIR OF THE HEALTH COMMITTEE. GOOD LUCK. START OVER. IT'S OKAY. GOOD AFTERNOON. THIS IS THE FOURTH IN A SERIES OF HEARINGS THAT WILL HELP US TO EXPLORE THE WAYS TO IMPROVE OUR STATE'S HEALTH CARE SYSTEM AND PROVIDE UNIVERSAL HEALTHCARE FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS. IN OUR PREVIOUS HEARINGS WE FOCUSED ON CALIFORNIA'S CURRENT SYSTEMS INCLUDING PUBLIC PROGRAMS. THEINDIVIDUAL MARKET EMPLOYER BASED PROGRAMS THE SAFETY NET PROGRAMS AND THE CURRENT GAPS IN COVERAGE. WE'VE ALSO HEARD ABOUT MULTIPLE MODELS OF UNIVERSAL COVERAGE SYSTEMS IN OTHER COUNTRIES. AT OUR LAST HEARING WE FOCUSED ON DIFFERENT MODELS AND PROGRAMS FROM AROUND THIS COUNTRY. AND THAT TODAY'S HEARINGS WE WILL HEAR FROM EXPERTS WHO HAVE RESEARCHED THE CHALLENGES PEOPLE HAVE HAD IN ACCESSING CARE. AND SOME OF THE CAUSES OF THE HIGH PRICES IN OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. THIS COMMITTEE'S CHARGE IS TO FIND WORKABLE SOLUTIONS THAT WILL EXPAND HEALTH CARE COVERAGE AND INCREASE ACCESS TO CARE. A BETTER ORGANIZED SYSTEM COVERING EVERY CALIFORNIAN WOULD ALMOST CERTAINLY CUT OUR HEALTH CARE COSTS. EVERY OTHER DEVELOPED NATIONS SPENDS LESS ON THEIR HEALTHCARE THAN WE DO. BUT WITH BETTER RESULTS. WE HOPE TO FIND A SYSTEM OR SYSTEMS THAT WILL PROVIDE COVERAGE TO ALL BY EXAMINING THE EFFICIENCIES AND COST CONTROL MECHANISMS UTILIZED IN OTHER MODELS. WE WILL LOOK FOR EVERY SINGLE WAY TO REDUCE OUT OF POCKET COSTS TO CONSUMERS BY LOOKING FOR WAYS TO MAKE OUR SYSTEM MORE EFFICIENT. I AM PARTICULARLY INTERESTED IN THE ISSUES OF ACCESS TO CARE AND UNDERSTANDING ALL OF THE REASONS THAT PEOPLE ARE FEELING TO GET. THE HEALTHCARE THAT THEY NEED. AS IN THE E. R. DOCTOR I HAD TO TREAT INDIVIDUALS THAT COULDN'T GET PREVENTIVE CARE. OR COULDN'T FIND OR AFFORD TO SEE A POSITION UNTIL THEY NEEDED TO COME TO THE ER. WHEN PEOPLE ARE RELYING ON THE E. ARE FOR THEIR HEALTH CARE THE MOST EXPENSIVE CARE AVAILABLE WE KNOW THE SYSTEM IS NOT WORKING. WE INTEND TO WORK TOWARD THE IDEAL THAT HEALTHCARE IN CALIFORNIA IS A HUMAN RIGHT. AS I HAVE SAID IN THESE LAST HEARINGS WE ARE CALIFORNIA WE DON'T FOLLOW WE LEAD. SO WITHOUT FURTHER ADO I'D LIKE TO OFFER MY COLLEAGUES WHO ARE HERE TO MAKE ANY OPENING STATEMENTS THAT THEY WOULDN'T. GREAT WILL GO AHEAD AND GET STARTED. WITH OUR FIRST. FOR SPOKEN HAVE DOCTOR ARE MISS AND LARRY LEVAN. SEES ME. THE CO EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF A PROGRAM FOR THE STUDY OF HEALTH REFORM AND PRIVATE INSURANCE FROM KAISER FAMILY FOUNDATION SO PLEASE COME ON UP. STERN LEVITT HAVE GOOD AFTERNOON CARE WOULD CHAIR ROMULAN THANKS FOR. HOLDING THESE HEARINGS AND THANKS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK. I'M GOING TO. TALK FOR A LITTLE BIT ABOUT TO A FRAGMENTATION. IN OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM AND WHAT IT MEANS FOR PATIENTS AFTER THE ABILITY TO CONTROL COSTS. TO GUARANTEE POPULATION HEALTH. AND EQUITY IN THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM YEAH I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT NO ONE WOULD DESIGN OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. OF FROM SCRATCH AND END UP WITH THIS CRAZY QUILT IF WE HAD TO DO IT ALL OVER AGAIN. BUT IT IS THE SYSTEM WE HAVE AND UNDERSTANDING ITS IMPLICATIONS BOTH GOOD AND BAD. MAY HELP TO INFORM WHAT BETTER SYSTEM MIGHT LOOK LIKE AND HOW BEST TO TRANSITION TO THAT. I'M TO PROVIDE THAT KIND OF BIRDS EYE VIEW OF. OF THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM AND AND FRAGMENTATION IN IT. THAT I THINK YOU'RE GOING TO HEAR MORE DETAIL FROM THIS MARKET THE PANELISTS. TO FOLLOW. IT'S GOOD AND IT'S GONNA STOP RIGHT NOW UNTIL WE CAN ASK. FOR THE QUIET OUTSIDE. PART BUT YOU KNOW. SIX. HELLO SO. MR LEVIN HOW LOUDLY CAN YOU SPEAK SO I COULD SPEAK HAVE POLITICAL. JUST WAIT TO THE GENTLEMAN IS A. NO THAT'S OKAY. THANK YOU. ONCE OVER THE PICTURE OF OF HEALTH COVERAGE IN OUR CURRENT SYSTEM I THINK THIS PICTURE IS QUITE FAMILIAR. TO MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. THEIR VARIETY OF ESTIMATES OF OF HEALTH COVERAGE IN IN CALIFORNIA BUT I THINK THIS GIVES A GOOD PICTURE. OF THE DIVERSITY OF OF COVERAGE. AS YOU CAN SEE EMPLOYER BASED INSURANCE. EVEN AFTER IMPLEMENTATION OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT IS STILL THE MAIN SOURCE OF COVERAGE OF FOR CALIFORNIANS AND PEOPLE IN IN EVERY OTHER STATE IN THE COUNTRY. AND IMPORTANTLY. IN ADDITION TO BEING A. A SIGNIFICANT SOURCE OF COVERAGE AYE EMPLOYER BASED INSURANCE IS ALSO LARGELY OUT OF. THE CONTROL OF STATE REGULATION. LARGELY CONTROLLED TICKLING SELF INSURED EMPLOYER PLANS UNDER THE FEDERAL TO WRESTLE AW SO LEAST IN THE CURRENT SYSTEM. AND THE LARGEST SOURCE OF COVERAGE IS LARGELY OUT OF OUT OF STATE CONTROL. ARM AS YOU KNOW MEDICAID. IS ALSO A LARGE SOURCE OF COVERAGE. GREW BIGGER GREW QUITE RAPIDLY FOLLOWING YEAH IMPLEMENTATION THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT THAT WHICH CALIFORNIA WAS CERTAINLY A PROACTIVE IN. IN THEIR CAL I MEAN CALIFORNIA'S MEDICAL PROGRAM IS IS LIKELY THE OUT ONE OF IF NOT THE LARGEST A PUBLIC INSURANCE PROGRAM. IN IN THE COUNTRY. MAYBE ONE MORE IMPORTANT THAN HOW PEOPLE ARE COVERED AT ANY ONE TIME WHICH IS WHAT THIS THIS CHART SHOWS. IS THE ENORMOUS CHURN ACROSS SOURCES OF COVERAGE AS PEOPLE CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE HOW PEOPLE CHANGE JOBS LOSE JOBS GAME JOBS. INCREASE OUR INCOME DECREASED THEIR INCOME. PEOPLE CHANGE VERY VERY FREQUENTLY FROM ONE SOURCE OF INSURANCE TO ANOTHER AND IT'S THOSE. IT'S THOSE TRANSITIONS FROM ONE SOURCE INSURANCE TO ANOTHER THAT'S OFTEN CREATES DISRUPTIONS. IN THE SYSTEM AND YOU'LL HEAR MUCH MORE ABOUT THAT THAT CHURN IN INSURANCE. FROM JOHN GRAVES LATER. NOW. THE. ONE OF THE THAT THE MAIN REASON FOR THE CHALLENGES THAT THE CHALLENGES THAT THESE DISRUPTIONS ARE. BECAUSE AS PEOPLE TRANSITION FROM ONE TYPE OF INSURANCE TO ANOTHER. IS BECAUSE EACH SECTOR OF OF THE HEALTH INSURANCE SYSTEM HAS VERY DIFFERENT RULES AND VERY DIFFERENT PROCEDURES. CERTAINLY ELIGIBILITY. IS VERY DIFFERENT ANYTIME SOMEONE TRANSITIONS FROM ONE SOURCE INSURANCE TO ANOTHER. TO HAVE TO GO THROUGH ELIGIBILITY PROCESS THAT PROCESS CAN CERTAINLY BE QUITE BURDENSOME OPTICALLY IN THE CASE OF MEDI CAL OR COVERED CALIFORNIA. CARSHARING VARIES NOT ONLY BETWEEN SECTORS BETWEEN MEDI CAL EMPLOYER BASED INSURANCE MEDICARE. AND INDIVIDUAL INSURANCE BUT ALSO AMONG ENSURE INSURANCE COMPANIES AND NOT JUST THE LEVEL OF DEDUCTIBLES OR CO PAYS OR CO INSURANCE. UP BUT WHAT THOSE DEDUCTIBLES OR CO PAYS APPLY TO AND THAT CREATES COMPLICATIONS AND CONFUSION AFTER PATIENTS AS WELL AS FOR HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS. I WOULD NOTE THAT THEY COVER CALIFORNIA HAS MADE GREAT STRIDES IN IN MINIMIZING SOME OF THIS. COMPLICATION BY STANDARDIZING COVERAGE. TO A MUCH GREATER EXTENT ACROSS INSURERS THAT IS TRUE ANOTHER OTHER SECTORS. ALSO I NETWORKS OF FIZZ PHYSICIANS IS POTENTIALLY THE BIGGEST SOURCE OF COMPLICATION FOR PATIENTS AND FRANKLY FOR PROVIDERS AS WELL. OUR SYSTEM IS STILL NOT GOOD AT KEEPING DIRECTORIES OF. IN NETWORK DOCTORS AND HOSPITALS UP TO DATE. PATIENTS CAN ALWAYS EASILY IDENTIFY WHICH DOCTORS ARE IN A PARTICULAR NETWORK. EITHER WHEN THEY CHOOSE THE PLAN OR WHEN THEY ACTUALLY ACCESS CARE. THIS CAN LEAD TO SURPRISE MEDICAL BILLS. WHEN YOU FIND YOURSELF BEING TREATED BY AN OUT OF NETWORK. PROVIDER. UNOPENED UNBEKNOWN STEVE TO YOU. CALIFORNIA CERTAINLY MAKE PROGRESS WITHOUT WITH THE SURPRISE MEDICAL BILL LAUP. THAT WENT INTO EFFECT LAST YEAR. BUT SELF INSURED EMPLOYER PLANS WHICH ARE. A LARGE SOURCE OF COVERAGE OR OUTSIDE OF THAT THAT STATE REGULATION. SIMILAR TO NETWORKS ARE DRUG FORMULARY STEVE THROUGH THE LIST OF DRUGS. THAT EACH INSURER COVERS. THOSE AGAIN VARY TREMENDOUSLY FROM SECTOR TO SECTOR AND FROM PLAN TO PLAN. AND IT'S NOT JUST WHICH DRUGS AND ENSURE COVERS. BUT WHICH SO CALLED TIER OF COST SHARING. THAT DRUGS ON WHETHER YOUR DRUG IS ON THE FIRST YEAR OF COST SHARING WITH A LOCAL PAYMENT. FOR THE HIGHEST TIER OF COST SHARING A TYPICALLY FOR SPECIALTY DRUGS WHICH WITH A VERY HIGH CO INSURANCE THAT CAN RUN INTO THE HUNDREDS IF NOT THOUSANDS. OF DOLLARS SO SO MANY PATIENT TRANSITIONING FROM ONE INSURER OR ONE TYPE OF INSURANCE TO ANOTHER CAN FIND THEMSELVES AYE NEEDING TO CHANGE DRUGS CHANGE DOCTORS CHANGE HOSPITALS. OR PAY VERY DIFFERENT AMOUNTS FOR THEIR CARE. ALSO CERTAINLY PRICES AND WILL HEAR A LOT ABOUT PRICING YOU'LL HEAR A LOT ABOUT PRICING TODAY. PRICES VARY TREMENDOUSLY FROM ONE SECTOR IS SECTOR TO ANOTHER I THINK AS MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE VERY NO WELL. PRICES PAID BY MEDICARE ALL ARE FAR LOWER THAN PRICES PAID BY COMMERCIAL INSURANCE. OR MEDICARE UP THE PRICES ALSO VARY TREMENDOUSLY FROM ONE REGION OF THE STATE TO ANOTHER. PRICES IN THE BAY AREA ARE MUCH HIGHER THAN PRICES IN. IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. IN THE. TREMENDOUSLY FROM ONE INSURER TO ANOTHER. ARE. ALSO THEIR PROCEDURES THAT INSURERS USE. TO MANAGE OR AUTHORIZE CARE. PRIOR AUTHORIZATION TO SEE A SPECIALIST OR TOGETHER NMR AYE OR TO. ACCESS HOSPITAL CARE. THESE PROCEDURES WHICH VARY FROM INSURER TO INSURER AGAIN OUR SOURCE OF CONFUSION AFTER PATIENTS AS WELL AS PROVIDERS. AND IN FINALLY GOVERNANCE. THERE IS NO ONE WHO IS IN CHARGE OF CALIFORNIA'S HEALTHCARE SYSTEM WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR. GUARANTEEING POPULATION HEALTH FOR CONTROLLING COSTS FOR INSURING QUALITY. FOR ENSURING EQUITY. YOU KNOW WE HAVE. HERE WE HAVE. MULTIPLE PUBLIC AGENCIES RESPONSIBLE FOR REGULATING INSURANCE IN CALIFORNIA. WE'VE GOT AGENCY RESPONSIBLE FOR RUNNING MEDI CAL. COUNTIES ALSO PLAYING A MAJOR ROLE. IN ADMINISTERING. MEDI CAL. A PRIVATE INSURERS. WHICH CAN RANGE FROM NONPROFIT TO FOR PROFIT. TO COMMUNITY BASED PLANS. AND ALSO EMPLOYERS AS WELL AND SO WE VERY BALKANIZED APPROACH EPICALLY COMPARED TO OTHER COUNTRIES IN OUR OVERSIGHT OF THE HEALTH CARE SO. I'M SETS A THINKING ABOUT THE CONSEQUENCES OF THIS. AND I WOULD SAY ALMOST EVERY CONSEQUENCE OF THIS FRAGMENTATION. HAS A FLIP SIDE AND I WOULD HESITATE TO. CALL THESE CONSEQUENCES GOOD OR BAD OR POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE. BECAUSE IT VERY MUCH DEPENDS. ON YOUR VALUES. AND. AND AND HOW YOU VIEW THEM. BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT UNDERSTAND THE CONSEQUENCES SO SORE POINT TO FIRST ARE CERTAINLY COSTS AND YOU KNOW WITH NO CENTRAL OVERSIGHT. OF HEALTH CARE COSTS IN THE SYSTEM. IT'S OFTEN VERY DIFFICULT TO CONTROL THOSE COSTS AND YOU KNOW WE AND. WE IN HEALTH POLICY OFTEN REFER TO THIS AS THE WATER BALLOON EFFECT AND IF YOU PUSH ON ONE. PART OF THE HEALTH SYSTEM IN ONE PART OF A WATER BALLOON AT THE COST TEND TO SHOW UP IN SOME OTHER PART OF THE WATER BILL AND. AND WITHOUT ANY ABILITY FOR CENTRAL OVERSIGHT IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO CONTROL THE OVERALL SIZE OF THE THE WATER BUILDING. NOW THE FLIP SIDE OF THAT IS THAT. THIS KIND OF LACK OF CONTROL ALSO IN SOME SENSE PROVIDES A SAFETY VALVE IF THE CONSTRAINTS ON COSTS ARE ARE TOO TIGHT. YOU HAVE THE THE THE. AT THE HEALTH SYSTEM IT YOU KNOW IF IF THERE'S A. AYE A FLU EPIDEMIC HAS IN FACT WHERE WE SEEM TO BE HAVING RIGHT NOW. IN THE UNITED STATES. YOU KNOW THERE THERE'S THAT THERE'S NO EXPLICIT DECISION THAT NEEDS TO BE MADE TO RELAX THAT THE COST CONSTRAINTS. ANOTHER CUT CONSEQUENCE WHICH I ALLUDED TO IS IS DISRUPTION OF CARE GIVEN THE CHURN. IN THE HEALTH INSURANCE SYSTEM THE RAPID TRANSITIONS FROM ONE TYPE OF INSURANCE. TO ANOTHER SHE PLANS WITH DIFFERENT NETWORKS DIFFERENT DRUG FORMULARIES A ANY CHANGE IN PLAN CAN REQUIRE CHANGING DOCTOR CHANGING HOSPITAL WHERE CHANGE IN IN MEDICATION AND LEAD TO SURPRISE MEDICAL BILLS. THIS AWESOME RAISES ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS IN IN IN MANAGING THE SYSTEM BOTH FOR PROVIDERS. AND FOR INSURERS. I WOULD SAY THE FLIP SIDE OF THAT IS THAT IT CREATES OPPORTUNITIES FOR INNOVATION. YOU KNOW I DON'T TO MAKE TO. TOO STRONG A CASE FOR THIS. BECAUSE FRANKLY MUCH OF THE INNOVATION AND PAYMENT REFORM. HAS COME FROM MEDICARE. AND. AND SPREAD TO TO THE PRIVATE SECTOR. UNIT BUT CERTAINLY ANYTIME YOU HAVE MULTIPLE PAYERS MULTIPLESECTORS. THERE'S GREATER OPPORTUNITY TO INNOVATE AND. IN BOTH QUALITY AND AND COSTS. AND GET UP A SINGLE PUBLIC PLAN PUTTING ALL YOUR EGGS IN THAT SINGLE BASKET A POTENTIALLY LEADS TO. STAGNATION IN IN THE SYSTEM. ARM. I WOULD SAY ALSO IN A AND AGAIN I LIEU TO TO THIS. WITH. THE LACK OF OF ANY CLEAR ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. IN ONE AGENCY OR ONE BODY WITH THAT DISPERSED CONTROL NO ONE IS ACCOUNTABLE FOR ENSURING QUALITY COST CONTROL OR AFFORDABILITY. AND CERTAINLY NOT THE HEALTH OF THE POPULATION AS AS A WHOLE. NATIONAL EFFORTS YOU'RE A YEARS AGO. TRIED TO CREATE LOCAL HEALTH PLANNING AGENCIES. TO TO FOCUS SOME OF THAT CONTROL IN A IN A SINGLE. IN A SINGLE. AGENCY. IN THOSE FRANKLY LARGELY FAILED. BECAUSE THEY ALSO DID NOT CONTROL THE MONEY. AND I THINK OUR EXPERIENCE IN HEALTHCARE IS THAT ANY ABILITY ANY EFFORT TO TRY TO. TO HOLD THE HEALTH SYSTEM ACCOUNTABLE WITHOUT CONTROL OVER THE FLOW OF FUNDS. IS LIKELY TO FAIL. I'M IN I WOULD SAY* FRANKLY. THIS FRAGMENTATION LEADS TO TEARING IN THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. WHERE WHAT YOU? WHAT COVERAGE YOU GET WHAT ACCESS YOU HAVE HOW AFFORDABLE COVERAGE IS? DEPENDS VERY MUCH ON. ON YOUR INCOME AND YOU AND YOUR RESOURCES. THIS DOESN'T ALWAYS WORK IN THE DIRECTION YOU MIGHT THINK FOR EXAMPLE LOWER INCOME PEOPLE IN MEDI CAL ARE COVERED CALIFORNIA WITH ACCESS TO COST SHARING SUBSIDIES. GET COVERAGE WITH MORE COMPREHENSIVE BENEFITS AND LOWER COST SHARING THEN MOST PEOPLE IN EMPLOYER BASED PLANS. AT THE SAME TIME THE NETWORKS OF PROVIDERS IN THOSE PLANTS IS OFTEN NARROWER AND ACCESS AT TIMES CAN BE MORE MORE DIFFICULT. YOU KNOW THE FLIPSIDE IN AGAIN THIS THIS DEPENDS ON YOUR VALUES. TEARING PERMITS. GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS TO PAY LESS. YOU KNOW A SINGLE SYSTEM WOULD ALMOST CERTAINLY REQUIRE HIGHER PRICES HIGHER PAYMENTS ON THE PART OF MEDI CAL. TO PHYSICIANS AND AND HOSPITALS. AND IT PROVIDES AUTONOMY. FOR CONSUMERS AND EMPLOYERS. YOU KNOW ANY TIERED SYSTEM ALLOWS AN ESCAPE FROM THAT SYSTEM. AND ALLOWS PEOPLE WHO CAN AFFORD MORE TO TO BUY MORE. AND WHETHER THAT'S. WHETHER THAT'S. AND APPEALING. CHARACTERISTIC OR NOT AGAIN DEPENDS ON YOUR VALUES. LOOKING INTERNATIONALLY AND AND I THINK WE TALKED ABOUT THIS IN THE LAST HEARING. ONE THING THAT CLEARLY DISTINGUISHES THE U. S. FROM OTHER COUNTRIES IS THAT ALL OTHER COMPARABLE HIGH INCOME COUNTRIES PROVIDE ESSENTIAL UNIVERSAL COVERAGE. AND I WITH IT WITH AT LEAST NINETY NINE POINT NINE PERCENT OF THE POPULATION COVERED. WE IN THE UNITED STATES IN CALIFORNIA CLEARLY DO NOT. WE'VE MADE TREMENDOUS PROGRESS UNDER THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT A CUTTING THE NUMBER OF UNINSURED. DRAMATICALLY OF THE MORE RECENTLY THE NUMBER VENTURED SEEMS TO BE RISING AGAIN. WITH THE CHANGE IN ADMINISTRATION. BUT WE ARE STILL FAR SHORT OF COVERING. THE WHOLE POPULATION. NOW I THINK NOT WELL UNDERSTOOD. IS THAT WHILE ALL OF THESE OTHER COUNTRIES PROVIDE UNIVERSAL COVERAGE A SINGLE PAYER IS NOT THE NORM IN IN MOST HIGH INCOME COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD. APPEAR SINGLE PAYER SYSTEM WITH MINIMAL PATIENT COST SHARING. IS SIMPLY NOT THE WAY THAT MOST OTHER COUNTRIES HAVE ACHIEVED UNIVERSAL COVERAGE. THEIR COUNTRIES LIKE GERMANY AND SWITZERLAND THAT RETAIN A SUBSTANTIAL ROLE FOR PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE. THAT'S I WOULD NOTE THAT THAT IN ALL THOSE CASES THOSE INSURERS ARE NONPROFIT AND NOT FOR PROFIT. AS MOST INSURERS ARE IN THE UNITED STATES. THERE'S ALSO SIGNIFICANT COST SHARING IN A NUMBER OF THESE COUNTRIES INCLUDING FRANCE GERMANY AND SWITZERLAND. AND IN SOME CASES PEOPLE CAN BUY SUPPLEMENTAL INSURANCE TO FEELING THAT COST SHARING MUCH LIKE THEY DO IN MEDICARE. HERE. AND WHILE ALL OF THESE OTHER COUNTRIES HAVE UNIVERSAL COVERAGE. THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT EVERYONE GETS EXACTLY THE SAME THING A NUMBER OF COUNTRIES CREATE OPPORTUNITIES FOR PEOPLE WITH MEANS TO PAY MORE TO GET MORE. BUT THE BASIC LEVEL OF COVERAGE IN THESE COUNTRIES IS CERTAINLY A MUCH HIGHER BAR THAN WE HAVE HERE IN THE U. S.. TOM AND I WOULD SAY THAT WHILE WHILE SINGLE PAYER IS NOT THE NORM. INTERNATIONALLY. OTHER COUNTRY CERTAINLY CARVE OUT A MUCH GREATER ROLE FOR GOVERNMENT OVERSIGHT OF THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. THAN WE DO IN THE UNITED STATES. SOME NOW CERTAINLY A SINGLE PAYER. WOULD. SUBSTANTIALLY. REDUCE THE FRAGMENTATION IN THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. BY ITS NATURE A SINGLE PAYER A PLAN ELIMINATES. THE DISRUPTION. FROM SWITCHING FROM ONE TYPE OF INSURANCE OR ONE PLAN TO ANOTHER. IT PROVIDES A MECHANISM FOR CONTROLLING COSTS. AND FOCUSES ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM IN ONE PLACE. GETTING TO THAT POINT AT WHICH I THINK I TALKED ABOUT IN THE LAST A HEARING. WOULD CERTAINLY BE A DISRUPTIVE. AND I THINK A SINGLE PAYER PLAN. RAISES IMPORTANT QUESTIONS ABOUT GOVERNANCE IF YOU'RE GONNA FOCUS THAT LEVEL OF RESPONSIBILITY AND CONTROL. IN ONE PLACE. WHAT IS THE GOVERNMENT'S GOVERNANCE OF THAT GOVERNMENT AGENCY QUASI GOVERNMENT AGENCY? YOU KNOW WHO WHO ADVISES WHO CONCLUDED THAT AGENCY CONSULT WITH. AND. HOW IS IT ADMINISTERED? CERTAINLY BY INSTAPUNDIT PROGRAMS WHETHER BUY INTO MEDICARE ALIBI INTO MEDICARE AT FEDERALLY WOULD HELP. REDUCE FRAGMENTATION OF THE OTHER OF COURSE NOT TO THE EXTENT OF A SINGLE A GOVERNMENT PLAN. TOM. AND I WOULD SAY A LOT OF THE CONSEQUENCES CONSEQUENCES OF FRAGMENTATION TEND TO REVOLVE AROUND DIFFERENCES IN PRICES. AND PROVIDER NETWORKS. IN THAT TYPE OF FRAGMENTATION AND. DISRUPTION FOR PATIENTS AND PROVIDERS THAT COULD BE MITIGATED THROUGH. AND ALL PAY RATE SETTING SYSTEM FOREXAMPLE. WHERE ALL PLANS? PAYS THE SAME. THE SAME RIGHTS THE SAME RATES. TO THE SAME PROVIDERS. OR EVEN THROUGH A MORE UNIFORM PRICING SYSTEM WHERE ALL PLANS AND PROVIDERS WERE REQUIRED TO. OPERATE. A SIMILAR PRICING STRUCTURE EVEN IF THE PRICE LEVELS. WERE NOT THE SAME SO SHORT OF A SINGLE PAYER PLAN AT LEAST REGULATING THE PRICING. COULD. COULD COULD REDUCE SOME OF THE DISRUPTION. FOR FOR PATIENTS. WITH A SIMILARLY GREATER UNIFORMITY IN BENEFITS ANDCOST SHARING. AS COVER CALIFORNIA HAS DONE. WOULD ALSO. BIG THE SYSTEM MUCH SIMPLER. AND REDUCE AGAIN SOME OF THAT ADMINISTRATIVE OVERHEAD AND SOME OF THAT COMPLICATION. I AM. AND FINALLY I WOULD SAY THAT THAT WHILE OUR OUR MEDICAL CARE SYSTEM IS IN MANY WAYS THAT A TECHNOLOGICAL MARVEL. OUR ADMINISTRATION OF THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM IS IN MANY WAYS INCREDIBLY BACKWARDS. TECH TECHNOLOGICALLY. AS THAT VOX NEWS REPORTED TO ADD JUST RECENTLY THE FAX MACHINE IS STILL. A IS STILL QUEEN IN THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM EVEN THOUGH IT'S HARD TO FIND IN IN THE REST OF THE OF THE ECONOMY. IT WE COULD REDUCE SOME OF THAT SOME OF THIS COMPLICATION. IN THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM FOR PATIENTS BUT CERTAINLY BY NO MEANS ARE OLDER MOST. THROUGH GREATER TRANSPARENCY. I'M GREATER. AVAILABILITY OF DATA. AND IN SOME WAYS UNLEASHING THE. THE. THE TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION. THAT WE HAVE IN CALIFORNIA AND SILICON VALLEY AND AND DOWN SOUTH. AND DEVELOPING TOOLS. AND TECHNOLOGIES THAT WOULD. THAT WOULD HELP SIMPLIFY THE SYSTEM. BEFORE WE MOVE ON TO OUR NEXT. PENALTIES. YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS PERSONAL THANK YOU VERY MUCH WITH THE OVERVIEW REALLY APPRECIATE THAT. QUESTIONS FOR MISTER LEVITT. AS YOU. THANK YOU FOR YOU'RE A PRESENTATION I THINK A CERTAINLY YOUR YOUR DIAGNOSIS OF WHY WE HAVE THE FRAGMENTATION IN THE SYSTEM THAT WE DO IS. CERTAINLY SPOT ON FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND THAT I THINK YOU'VE LAID OUT OF SOME OF THE CHOICES WE HAVE. ARM IF YOU WERE HEALTH CARE'S R. CALIFORNIA. AMONG THESE DIFFERENT. OPPORTUNITIES THAT WE HAVE WHAT WOULD YOU WOULD YOU UP FOR. CAN I TURN DOWN THAT HEALTHCARE IS OUR JOB. YOU CAN TURN A DOWN BUT WE'D LIKE YOU TO ADVISE HIM. I. AS AN ORGANIZATION THE KAISER FAMILY FOUNDATION DOESN'T DOESN'T ADVOCATE ANY PARTICULAR. SO WE WILL STIPULATE YOU'RE NOT SPEAKING FOR OUR KAISER BUT ARE SPEAKING AS A. INDIVIDUAL WHO HAS A LOT OF EXPERTISE IN THIS. I MEAN I WOULD TAKE AND IT YOU KNOW AND NO ONE WOULD DESIGN OUR CURRENT SYSTEM. IF GIVEN THE ABILITY TO TO TO DO SO FROM THAT FROM SCRATCH AND AND I WOULD CERTAINLY SAY. AT GREATER TRANSPARENCY. GREATER UNIFORMITY AND PRICES. WOULD BE AN ENORMOUS STEP IN. BOTH CONTROLLING COSTS. IN SIMPLIFYING THE SYSTEM. AND YOU KNOW WELL THAT WOULD CERTAINLY BE A A HEAVY LEFT OF BOTH TECHNICALLY AND POLITICALLY. IT WOULD. IT WOULD IT WOULD MAKE AN ENORMOUS DIFFERENCE. AND. YOU KNOW I I THINK WOULD BE A. TO IT TAKING THAT STEP YOU KNOW WHETHER YOU SUPPORT. A SINGLE PAYER SYSTEM ARE NOT TAKING THAT STEP. WOULD BE. IT YOU KNOW WOULD BE AT A MINIMUM THE TRANSITION. TO A A A A LESS EXPENSIVE. FAIRER SIMPLER AND SIMPLER HEALTH CARE'S. SO INTERNET A CONTRIVED. YEAH I HEAR WHAT YOU'RE SAYING YOU'RE SAYING YOU YOU'D BE OPEN POTENTIALLY TO THE IDEA OF SINGLE PAYER. I I I I I'M. I THINK AND I AND I THINK I SAID THIS AT THE LAST HEARING AND IT'S IT SINGLE PAYER AYE I THINK SINGLE PAYER IS THE ONLY WAY. PROBABLY THE ONLY WAY TO GET TEETH TO UNIVERSAL COVERAGE. SO. CERTAINLY IF THAT IS THE GOAL THEN I THINK A A SINGLE PAYER SYSTEM OR SOMETHING VERY SIMILAR TO IT. IS THE ONLY WAY TO DO THAT AND AND I WOULD SAY REALLY. THAT THE FUNDAMENTAL. THINK THE KEY TO THAT IS. ITS TAX BASE FINANCING. WHERE EVERYONE IS AUTOMATICALLY COVERED? WHERE IT'S NOT A VOLUNTARY SYSTEM WHERE YOU HAVE TO SIGN UP? OHIO OR OR PAY PREMIUMS YOU KNOW WHETHER OR NOT THERE'S AN INDIVIDUAL MANDATE. OR NOT. AND. I WOULD ALSO SAY THAT AT A SINGLE. PAYER SYSTEM OF OF SOME SORT. OR EVEN A SYSTEM OF. YOU KNOW NONPROFIT INSURERS TODAY NEGOTIATE. PRICES. WITH PROVIDERS SIMILAR TO GERMANY. IS. IS THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY TO I CERTAINLY REDUCE ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS AND TROUT COSTS OVERALL. I I APPRECIATE YOUR ANSWER CERTAINLY SOMEONE WHO ALSO SUPPORTS THE VISION OF OF SINGLE PAYER. ON AND I THINK WHAT I HURT MY NEXT QUESTION WAS GONNA BE IF THERE IS A VARIATION OF A SINGLE PAYER. SYSTEM AND OTHER COUNTRIES THAT YOU WERE MORE OPEN TO IT SOUNDS LIKE GERMANY. YEAH I THINK YOU HAVE IT AGAIN IF YOU LOOK AT OTHER COUNTRIES. THAT THEY THEY HAVE ALL GOT OTHER HIGH INCOME COUNTRIES HAVE ALL ACHIEVED UNIVERSAL COVERAGE. BUT HAVE DONE SO IN IN VERY DIFFERENT WAYS AND THROUGH A VERY DIFFERENT RATES. YOU KNOW WHICH RANGE FROM. AFT A FULLY. A NATIONAL HEALTHCARE SYSTEM LIKE IN THE UNITED KINGDOM. SINGLE PAYER SYSTEM LIKE IN CANADA TO. MULTIPLE NONPROFIT INSURERS LIKE IN GERMANY AND SWITZERLAND. WHAT THEY ALL HAVE IN COMMON IS EVERYONE IS GUARANTEED? COVERAGE AND THERE IS SOME OF MUCH LARGER ROLE FOR GOVERNMENT AND. IN NEGOTIATING R. SETTING PRICES. AND THEN IN THE FINAL QUESTION GIVEN THE POLITICAL REALITIES OF THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION WHAT ADVICE COUNSEL WOULD YOU HAVE FOR US OR FOR A HYPOTHETICAL HEALTH CARE IS OUR CALIFORNIA. TO DESIGN A SYSTEM WITH THE IDEA THAT AWFULLY SOMEDAY IN THE FUTURE IT'S CLOSER TO WHAT YOU JUST LAID OUT. I'M HYI I WOULD SAY AND I THINK. YOU YOU ALL UPSET THROUGH THESE HEARINGS HALF WORK ON THESE ISSUES EVERY DAY. I MEAN THIS IS ENORMOUSLY COMPLICATED. YOU KNOW DESIGNING A SYSTEM. IS COMPLICATED THINKING ABOUT THE KIND OF WAIVERS. THEY WOULD REQUIRE THAT WOULD REQUIRE FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. IS TECHNICALLY COMPLICATED AS WELL AS POLITICALLY DIFFICULT. AND SO THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT THAT THAT HAPPENS OVERNIGHT. SO I THINK YOU KNOW GOING THROUGH THIS PROCESS OF THINKING ABOUT. WHERE YOU WANNA DOT? EVEN IF YOU CAN'T GET THERE. POLITICALLY WITH THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE THAT PROCESS GUY COULD VERY WELL TAKE YEARS. AND. AND SIMILARLY THINKING ABOUT THE TRANSITION STEPS. YOU KNOW IT SAM. YOU KNOW SOMETIMES AND HEALTH CARE AS IN IN ALL OF PUBLIC POLICY WE THINK ABOUT WHAT'S POSSIBLE TODAY. AND THAT'S COMPLETELY APPROPRIATE BUT YOU ALSO WANT TO THINK ABOUT WHERE YOU WANT TO GET TO AND WHETHER THOSE INCREMENTAL STEPS ARE. KIND OF ON THE PATH TO. TO WHERE YOU ULTIMATELY WANT TO GO. ANSWER ONE FROM ITS HER ONE FINAL QUESTION SOUND THE ONE MAJOR HEALTH CARE CHANGE IN OUR SYSTEM THAT'S DIFFERENT FROM THE LAST YEAR IN THAT WE HAD. WAS THAT. THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION AND HIS REPUBLICAN ALLIES HAVE ELIMINATED THE INDIVIDUAL MAN. ABOUT WHAT YOUR THOUGHTS ABOUT WHETHER THAT'S SOMETHING WE SHOULD TRY TO RESTORING CALIFORNIA IN THE NEAR TERM. YEAH I THINK. IN CALIFORNIA HAS. AS YOU KNOW DEBATED AN INDIVIDUAL MANDATE IN IN THE PAST NUMBER YEARS AGO UNDER GOVERNOR SCHWARZENEGGER. AND IT'S CERTAINLY A CONTROVERSIAL BUT CERTAINLY NOT THE MOST POPULAR. ASPECT OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. I WOULD SAY OUR POLLING SHOWS THAT IF YOU EXPLAIN TO PEOPLE. THE PURPOSE OF THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE. THAT IT'S FAIR TO HELP BROADEN THE RISK POOL LOWER PREMIUMS. IT SURE THAT EVERYONE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR GETTING COVERAGE. HAD IT HAS MUCH LESS OPPOSITION. DAN DAN INITIALLY. YEAH I THINK CALIFORNIA PARTICULARLY WITH THE INCOME TAX STRUCTURE WE HAVE HERE IS WELL POSITIONED TO IMPLEMENT AN INDIVIDUAL MANDATE. IT IF YOU IF YOU SO CHOOSE. YOUR MARYLAND IS ACTUALLY PURSUING. THAT AS WELL. IT HAS AN INTERESTING IDEA TO ALLOW PEOPLE. TO SORT PUT ASIDE THEIR PENALTY. IN A FUND THAT THEY COULD DO AND USED TO BUY INSURANCE. SO IT'S A PENALTY THAT THAT THAT IS OF USE TO THAT INDIVIDUAL. LATER ON RATHER THAN JUST GOING INTO THE. INTO THE GENERAL FUND. I THINK THERE ARE OTHER APPROACHES CALIFORNIA COULD TAKE AT AND MITIGATE THE EFFECT OF REPEALING INDIVIDUAL MANDATE. CERTAINLY EXPANDING OUTREACH SIGNIFICANTLY. BECAUSE THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO ARE ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICARE I'LL ELIGIBLE FOR PREMIUM SUBSIDIES FOR COVER CALIFORNIA. ABOUT ARE NOT ENROLLED SO EXPANDING OUT REACH. COULD HAVE. A BIG EFFECT TO BRINGING HEALTH YOUR PEOPLE. INTO THE POOL. AND EVEN CONSIDER EXPANDING. SUBSIDIES. YOU KNOW IN MANY WAYS THAT THE STICK OF THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE IS THE FLIP SIDE OF THE CARROT. OF THE SUBSIDIES. SO WITHOUT THE STICK EXPANDED SUBSIDIES. COULD ALSO HELP IMPROVE IMPROVE THE SYSTEM. GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU MISTER. TREATMENT SHIP QUESTION. ANYONE ELSE. THIS WATER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR OF. THANK YOU FOR COMING. I KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF INFORMATION SO I JUST TRIED IT. BRIEFLY GO OVER ONE OF THE THINGS THAT CAME TO MY ATTENTION WAS ON OLDER AMERICANS AND THAT THE ISSUES THAT THEY HAVE TO DEAL WITH. TRYING TO ACCESS CARE. YOU KNOW AS WE'VE GONE THROUGH THESE HEARINGS WE'VE GOTTEN A LOT OF INFORMATION. THAT WE DID HAVE THE COMMONWEALTH FUND REPORT IT DURING ONE OF OUR HEARINGS WHICH WAS IN A VERY IN DEPTH. I AM. WE KNOW THAT OLDER AMERICANS HAVE WORSE HEALTH OUTCOMES. AND THEY'RE PAYING HIGHER COSTS FOR THAT. BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE US POPULATION WHAT WE'RE SEEING THE SILVER SO NAMI. MORE THAN TEN THOUSAND ADULTS TURNED SIXTY FIVE EVERYDAY. AND I'M BY TWENTY SIXTEEN NINETY POINT TWO MILLION AMERICANS ALMOST A QUARTER OF THE POPULATION WILL BE SIXTY FIVE OR OLDER. BUT THEN WHEN WE LOOK AT YOU KNOW FROM WHAT WE SAW FROM THIS COMMONWEALTH. FUND. STUDY THAT. UNDER CORNER OF OLDER AMERICANS IN THE PAST YEAR AND NOT EVEN SEEN A DOCTOR WHEN THEY'RE SICK. AND NOT FEEL DISTANT. PRESCRIPTION ORDERED SKIP THE MEDICATION DOSE WHEREAS IN OTHER COUNTRIES. THEY'RE DOING A LOT BETTER IN THAT REGARD IN. YOU KNOW I. HOW DO WE YOU KNOW REALLY WOKE BECAUSE A LOT OF THEM A DUAL ROLE? MAYBE THEY WEREN'T INSURED AT ALL THAN THEIR INTO MEDICAID MEDICARE. AND WE'RE NOT ADDRESSING ALL OF THAT AND WHAT YOU SEE IS THE TRENDS. GOING FORWARD YOU KNOW AS FAR AS BEING ABLE TO KEEP. ACCESS IS WILL'S COVERAGE FOR THESE FOLKS. HERE I THINK YOU KNOW DE. FIRST OF ALL IT WITH THAT WITH OLDER AMERICANS ACT YOU KNOW MANY OF WHOM WERE UNINSURED BEFORE THEY TURN SIXTY FIVE AND AND GAINED ELIGIBILITY FOR MEDICARE. WE'RE SEEING THE EFFECTS OF. MANY YEARS OF LACK OF COVERAGE AND AND AND LACK OF ACCESS. AND THAT KIND OF COMES HOME TO ROOST. WHEN THEY. WHEN THEY TURN SIXTY FIVE AND END UP IN IN MEDICARE. YOU KNOW I I ALSO I MEAN MEDICARE IS A A UNIVERSAL NEAR UNIVERSAL. SYSTEM FOR FOR OLDER AMERICANS. BUT IT'S FAR FROM PERFECT INSURANCE. YOU KNOW IF YOU STACKED MEDICARE UP TO A TYPICAL EMPLOYER PLAN IT DOESN'T ALWAYS COMPARE VERY WELL AND IT HAS SUBSTANTIAL COST SHARING. NO CAP ON ON OUT OF POCKET COSTS. YOU KNOW MANY PEOPLE COMPENSATE FOR THAT. BY BUYING SUPPLEMENTAL INSURANCE IN ROLLING IN A MEDICARE ADVANTAGE. PRIVATE INSURANCE PLAN. OR OR THROUGH MEDI CAL. OR MEDICAID AS A AS A TOOL ELIGIBLE LIST IF THEIR INCOMES ARE ARE LOW. BUT YOU KNOW I EIGHT THINK WHAT WHILE WHILE MEDICARE IS IS DOES PROVIDE THAT UNIVERSAL COVERAGE. IT'S. YOU KNOW IT'S FAR FROM WITHOUT PROBLEMS AND MEN AND SOME OF THE SAME PROBLEMS THAT THAT PLAGUE. YEAH PLAGUE PLAGUE THE SYSTEM FOR PEOPLE UNDER AGE SIXTY FIVE AS WELL NOW I'M AND WE'RE LOOKING AT HERE HOW WE COMPARE TO OTHER COUNTRIES. LOCAL LOTS OF FOLKS LOOK AT CANADA AS A SYSTEM. TWENTY NINE PERCENT OF OLDER CANADIANS REPORT WAITING SIX MORE DAYS. FOR A DOCTOR'S APPOINTMENT WHEN THEY'RE SICK COMPARED TO EIGHTEEN PERCENT OF U. S. SENIORS. AND. ON. MY IN LAWS MY HUSBAND'S MOM AND DAD BOTH THE CANADIAN FROM QUEBEC. AND THEY HAVE RELATIVES WHO LIVE THERE AND THEY ARE REGULARLY CROSSING THE BORDER INTO THE UNITED STATES TO ATTACK OUR HEALTHCARE. AND THAT'S A FACT THAT PLEASE TRULY SO. YOU KNOW THERE'S A LOT TO WAIT HERE AS FAR AS YOU KNOW BUT I DON'T WANNA LEAVE OLDER. CITIZENS OUT BECAUSE THEY ARE A GROUP THAT YOU KNOW IS GROWING DAY BY DAY. ON. THE OTHER THING IS I AM CURRENT RATES AND TRENDS OF. CERTAIN HEALTH CARE AND TREATMENTS THINGS LIKE WELL CHILDCARE VISITS CERVICAL CANCER SCREENINGS BREAST CANCER SCREENINGS TIMELINESS OF THE FIRST PRENATAL VISIT. FREQUENCY OF PRENATAL CARE TIMELY POSTPARTUM CARE. ON. I WENT ON THE WHOLE CARE AFFECTED THIS DATA AND INFORMATION SET THEM WEBSITE. I GUESS IT'S COOL HEAD THIS HIDEOUS HIDEOUS YOUR* AND. YOU KNOW THAT'S ANOTHER THING WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO LOOK AT. IN MY FEET FOR ANOTHER HEARING BUT HOW ARE OUR CURRENT RATES AND TRENDS OF THESE. TOPICS WILD CHILD CARE VISITS. POST CARE HOW ARE THOSE. EFFECTIVE EIGHT VERSUS. OTHER NATIONS AS WELL AS. BETWEEN THE INSURANCE COMMERCIAL INSURANCE MEDICO. MARKETPLACE. TO HAVE DATA ON THOSE THAT WE WAIT WE DO HAVE SOME THAT WOULD BE HAPPY TO TO TO PROVIDE THAT. AND. YOU KNOW I THINK WE WE WE TEND TO FOCUS ON ON COVERAGE IN AND COSTS. BUT CERTAINLY THAT THE QUALITY OF HEALTHCARE THE OUTCOMES ARE. ARE JUST AS A POINT AND A IMPORTANT THOSE KIND OF LAUGHED AT A CENTRAL POINT OF ACCOUNTABILITY NOW AS WELL. IN WHICH A COMPARED TO OTHER COUNTRIES I MEAN WE SPEND FAR MORE. THAN OTHER COUNTRIES ON ON HEALTHCARE. EIGHTEEN PERCENTOF GDP AND IN THE UNITED STATES COMPARED TO ELEVEN PERCENT IN. SIMILAR HIGH INCOME COUNTRIES BUT INTERESTINGLY THOSE OTHER COUNTRIES TEND TO MAKE UP SOME OF THAT GAP THROUGH. SOCIAL SERVICES GOT A SPEND MUCH MORE ON THINGS LIKE HOUSING AND FOOD ASSISTANCE AND. AND OTHER SOCIAL SERVICES THAT. YOU KNOW ARE NOT UNCONNECTED TO TO HEALTH CARE AND AND ACCESS TO SOME OF THE THINGS THAT YOU TALKED ABOUT. PLAN THAT WILL TIE IN WITH THE SENIOR CITIZEN CARE BECAUSE A LOT OF THEM JUST NEED BASIC. YOU KNOW LIVING TO HELP THEM BUT JUST AS A RAPPER. WHEN WE LOOK AT THE HIDEOUS CHARTS. A AND THEY COMPARED TO MARSHALL MEDICAID AND MEDICARE WELL CHILDCARE VISITS. IT LOOKS AS THOUGH. COMMERCIAL HMO AND PPO DOING FINE BUT THE MEDICAID HMO HAS THE LOWEST RATES OF. CHILD. WELL VISITS. HERE IN THE IT DOES EVERY THOSE COMPARISONS ARE ARE VERY TOUGH. BECAUSE. YOUR COMMERCIAL INSURERS PRICKLY EMPLOYER BASED INSURERS ARE COVERING A VERY DIFFERENT. POPULATION. THEN. THAT THEN THERE MEDI CAL WHICH IS NOT SAY THERE AREN'T ISSUES OF ACCESS IN MEDI CAL I THINK THEE THERE ARE. BUT IT'S IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO TO ZURICH CONTROLLER GUY IN A STATISTICAL WAY. FOR THOSE THOSE VERY DIFFERENT POPULATIONS I MEAN I YOU KNOW THAT SOMEONE HAS LOW INCOME WHOSE. STRUGGLING. IF YOU KNOW WHAT THEIR HOUSEHOLD BUDGET. ON EVERYTHING INCLUDING HEALTHCARE. YOU KNOW TRIBE STRUCK WITH PAIN FOR FOOD STRUGGLE WITH HOUSING. THAT'S GOING TO IMPACT THEIR ABILITY TO TAXES HEALTH CARE AS WELL. THANK YOU. YOU KNOW FIRST I. WANTED TO REPEAT YOUR STATEMENT TO MAKE SURE I GOT IT CORRECT BUT. MY UNDERSTANDING WAS THAT YOU SAID THAT NO ONE IS TRYING TO RECREATE OUR HEALTHCARE DELIVERY SYSTEM. I THINK I KNOW NO ONE WOULD. YEAH. YEAH THAT FRAGMENTATION THEN SHOULD LEAD US TO REALLY LOOKING AT THE CONSEQUENCES THAT YOU HAD ON YOUR PAGE SO I WANTED TO READ THEM BACK TO YOU TO. MAKE SURE THAT THE VALUES. THAT WE'RE TRYING TO PROTECT OR ARE WE A DIFFERENT ENTITY MOVING TOWARDS A DIFFERENT. SO YOU SAY BY HAVING A FRAGMENTED HEALTH CARE SYSTEM WE MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT TO CONTROL COSTS. WE RISK DISRUPTIONS IN CARE AND WE AVOID CLEAR ACCOUNTABILITY FOR COST TO POPULATION HEALTH. WELL CREATING A TIERED HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. THOSE STATEMENTS MAKE ME REALIZE THAT THIS FRAGMENTED HEALTHCARE DELIVERY MODEL. IS CAUSING SOME OF THE PROBLEMS WE HAVE WITH THEM HEALTHCARE. WE HAVE. A SAYING THAT IT'S A EUPHEMISM BUT IT'S AN APPLE A DAY KEEPS THE DOCTOR AWAY. THAT AN OUNCE OF PREVENTION IS WORTH A POUND OF CURE. THAT FRAGMENTATION REALLY LEADS TO AN UNDER INVESTMENT IN DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND OTHER AGENCIES THERE REALLY DO HELP TO KEEP OVERALL HEALTHCARE COSTS DOWN. MIGHT. QUESTION IS GOING TO BE. IN YOUR CLOTHES YOU SAID THAT AN OPTION TO BUY EN. OR AND ALL PAYER MODEL WERE TWO EXAMPLES THAT WE SHOULD CONSIDERING AND I WANTED TO UNDERSTAND FROM YOU HOW THAT WOULD HELP US. TO ADDRESS THE CONSEQUENCES THAT YOU LISTED HERE. YES I I THINK IN IN IN A COUPLE WAYS. A GREAT GREATER REGULATION OF PRICING AND AND ALL PAYER RATE SETTING SYSTEM. WOULD IT WOULD HELP TO ADDRESS THE COST SIDE. YOU KNOW THE THING THAT. THAT THAT THE THING THAT DIFFERENCE THIRD THE REASON WE SPEND SO MUCH MORE ON HEALTHCARE. IN OTHER COUNTRIES IS NOT BECAUSE WE USE MORE HEALTH CARE IT'S BECAUSE WE PAY HIGHER PRICES. THEN THEN THAN OTHER COUNTRIES. SO IT ALL PAYER RATE SETTING SYSTEM OF SOME SORT WOULD HELP TO ADDRESS. THAT DEBT PRICE ISSUE. WHICH WOULD CERTAINLY STILL LEAVE A LOT OF THE OTHER FRAGMENTATION. YOU KNOW THEY'RE THERE WOULD STILL BE NETWORKS. OF OF PROVIDERS ALTHOUGH I THINK A MORE REGULATED PRICING STRUCTURE I WOULD EVEN. SOME OF THAT OUT AND INCREASED MORE UNIFORM NETWORKS. THERE STILL BE DIFFERENCES AND BENEFITS DIFFERENCES AND COST SHARING. YOU KNOW BUT IT BUT A LOT OF THE. KIND OF BACK AND COMPLICATION. AND AND HIGH COST OF THE CURRENT SYSTEM COULD BE ADDRESSED. THROUGH THRALL PAIR RATE SETTING. YOU KNOW AS A BY AND AYE I WOULD SEE IS. BUY INTO MEDICARE ALIBI INTO MEDICARE FEDERALLY. IS IS SORT OF A STEP IN THE DIRECTION. ARMED. YOU KNOW IF. II IF A SINGLE PAYER SYSTEM IS. IT IS IS WHERE YOU WANT TO GO BUT IT'S IT IT'S TOO DIFFICULT TO GET THEIR. IMMEDIATELY THEN. A BY AND PARTICULARLY BY AND WHERE. A LOT OF THE POPULATION EVEN EMPLOYERS HAVE THE CHOICE OF BUYING INTO THAT SYSTEM. IS A WAY OF KIND EASING INTO IT. SO WHAT DO YOU KNOW IT DOESN'T GET THERE OVERNIGHT. DOESN'T GET THERE IMMEDIATELY IT DOESN'T ADDRESS ALL OF THE FRAGMENTATION IMMEDIATELY. BUT IT STARTS TO MOVE IN THAT DIRECTION. ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT I REALLY HAVE WITH FRAGMENTATION IS. TURNING I KNOW WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THAT LATER IN THE DISCUSSION BUT. YOU KNOW WE TEND TO FOCUS OUR DISCUSSIONS ON THE ON INSURED RATHER THAN THE UNDERINSURED OR THE PEOPLE WHO ARE JUST. STRUGGLING TO MAKE ENDS MEET AND. WE MUST HAVE THAT SUBSTANTIVE DISCUSSION ABOUT HOW WE REMOVE SOME OF THAT FRAGMENTATION SO THAT WE CAN. MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN HELP WITH THAT. AND. THAT'S JUST A COMMENT I WANNA LEAVE IT THERE UNTIL WE HEAR THE CONVERSATION LATER. I WANNA THANK YOU OF MISTER LEVITT AND I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT I KNOW WILL HAVE YOU BACK AT THE END FOR. DISH ADDITIONAL COMMENTS BUT I BUT I JUST WANNA AND APPRECIATE THE OVERVIEW I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO SAT. TO SET FOR SPECIAL FOR FOLKS WHO HAVEN'T BEEN TO ANY OF OUR HEARINGS BEFORE. AND ONE OF THE FEW THINGS THAT I AGREE WITH WHAT MAY BE THE ONLY THING I AGREE WITH WITH OUR CURRENT ADMINISTRATION IS THAT HEALTHCARE IS COMPLICATED. AND. BEYOND THAT I HAVE A REAL PROBLEM WITH SOME THE THINGS GOING ON OUT OF THE STATE. BUT YEAH I THINK IMPORTANT TO ME. THE TAKE AWAY FROM HERE IS. TRANSITIONS AND I THINK THAT'S AN IMPORTANT CONVERSATION THE I AGREE WITH YOU. KNOWING WHAT EVER INVENT THE SYSTEM WE HAVE IN THE UNITED STATES AGAIN. IT'S BEEN. IT'S BEEN A HORRIBLE HORRIBLE PROBLEM FOR ALL OF US FOR FOR A VERY LONG TIME. I APPRECIATE THE INFORMATION ABOUT MEDICARE I'M I'M IN AND I WILL SAY THAT I HEAR FROM PEOPLE ALL THE TIME I WON A SINGLE PAYER MEDICARE FOR ALL UNIVERSAL HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. AND I GO WOW WHAT DO YOU REALLY WANT. BECAUSE. THEY'RE ALL DISTINCTLY DIFFERENT. AND I THINK WHAT PEOPLE REALLY WANT IS HIGH QUALITY CARE ON AT A REASONABLE COST. DEAL GET TO DOCTORS. AND GET GET THE CARE THEY NEED WITHOUT BANKRUPTING THEM THAT'S WHAT I THINK WEEKLY AND SO I APPRECIATE THE OR VIEW BECAUSE. YOU'VE I POINTED OUT MEDICARE IS NOT A PERFECT SYSTEM. AND YOU THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT COSTS RELATED TO THAT ON THAT THE OUR TRANSITIONS THAT ARE GOING TO BE INVOLVED ON TO TO GET TO WHERE WE NEED TO GO. AND. AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT AS WE CONTINUE THIS DISCUSSION TO RECOGNIZE THOSE THOSE ISSUES AND. APPRECIATE APPRECIATE YOU BRING UP FOR ITSELF THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I WILL GO AHEAD AND BRING UP OUR OUR OUR NEXT PANEL. WHICH IS GOING TO BE. AYE RELATED TO ACCESS TO CARING COVERAGE. WELL ACTUALLY HEAR FROM ALL FOUR PANELISTS BEFORE WE GO TO QUESTIONS FROM THE PANEL. AND. DOCTOR REGULAR WILL GO AHEAD AND INTRODUCE OUR OUR FIRST PANELIST. SO IF WE CAN HAVE SABRINA COR LET. CHRIS PERONI JANET KAUFMAN AND JOHN GRAVES COME FORWARD. AND AS THEY DO WELL BE READING THE BIO FOR SABRINA QUICKLY THANK YOU AND I'VE BEEN CORRECTED I THINK IT'S CHRIS PERON SO SORRY ABOUT THAT. SABRINA CORPS LET OUR FIRST PRESENTER IS A RESEARCH PROFESSOR AT THE CENTER ON HEALTH INSURANCE REFORMS AT GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY. AT THE CENTER ON HEALTH INSURANCE REFORMS SHE DIRECTS RESEARCH ON PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE AND THE UNIVERSITY AND INSURANCE MARKETS SHE PROVIDES EXPERTISE AND STRATEGIC ADVICE TO INDIVIDUALS AND ORGANIZATIONS. ON FEDERAL AND STATE HIT WITH INSURANCE LAWS AND PROJECT THANK YOU FOR COMING HERE TODAY. THANK YOU DOCTOR AND GOT THANK YOU. TO PUT IT I REALLY APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE TODAY. AND TAKE PART IN THIS VERY VERY IMPORTANT SERIES OF HEARINGS. SO JUST A MOMENT ABOUT THE CENTER ON HEALTH INSURANCE REFORMS AND WHERE GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY'S MCCOURT SCHOOL OF PUBLIC POLICY. WE'RE PART OF A LARGER TEAM THE STUDIES HEALTH POLICY ISSUE ISSUES MEDICARE MEDICAID CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE. BUT CHEER R. CENTER FOCUSES PRIMARILY ON PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE AND PRIVATE. HEALTH INSURANCE MARKETS. AND HOW THEY FIVE BAND EVOLVING I'M PARTICULARLY. OVER. PASSAGE OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. AND. AND MORE RECENT EFFORTS TOO. ROLLED OUT LAW BACK. I AM SO I'M GONNA TALK. PRIMARILY TODAY ABOUT THE INDIVIDUAL PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE MARKET. AND SOME OF THE. ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN EMERGING AROUND PLAN CHOICE AND THE PRICES THAT CONSUMERS PAY IN THAT MARKET. YOU SAW A LITTLE BIT FROM. LARRY LEVITT SLIDES BUT I THINK SOME KEY CHARACTERISTICS OF THE INDIVIDUAL MARKET IN CALIFORNIA AS WELL AS IN OTHER STATES. IS A RELATIVELY SMALL MARKET AND CERTAINLY COMPARED TO. MEDI CAL AS WELL AS EMPLOYER BASED OR. EMPLOYER SPONSORED INSURANCE. ROUGHLY TWO POINT THREE MILLION PEOPLE ENROLLED. WITH OVER HALF OF THEM IN COVERED CALIFORNIA. AND THE MAJORITY OF THOSE. RECEIVING PREMIUM SUBSIDIES. YOU COMPARE THAT TO MEDI CAL WITH TEN POINT FIVE MILLION OUR EMPLOYER BASED COVERAGE WITH ELEVEN POINT EIGHT IT'S A IT'S A RELATIVELY SMALL MARKET. IT ALSO TENDS TO BE A FAIRLY TRANSITIONAL MARKET. PEOPLE CYCLE AND AND CYCLE OUT WHICH IS VERY ARM BUT THEY'RE VERY DIFFERENT FOR EXAMPLE THAT MEDICARE. ANY COULD BE DUE TO LIFE CIRCUMSTANCES IT COULD BE YOUR YOU KNOW RECENT COLLEGE GRAD WHO JUST HASN'T QUITE FIGURED OUT THEIR CAREER PATH YOU HAD OR. THE MIDDLE AGED MOM WHO DECIDES TO TAKE SOME TIME OFF WORK TO CARE FOR AN AGING PARENT IT COULD BE THAT PERSON YOU DECIDES TO TAKE OFF WORK ON IT A YEAR TOO EARLY BEFORE THEY TURN SIXTY FIVE AND BECOME ELIGIBLE FOR. MEDICARE ALSO COULD BE INCOME CHANGES THAT MIGHT CAUSE YOU TO COME INTO THE INDIVIDUAL MARKET FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU GET MORE HOURS AT WORK OUR SMALL PAY RAISE YOU COULD LOSE ELIGIBILITY. FOR MEDICAID. BUT IT'S ALSO I THINK IMPORTANT NO DOUBT WHILE THIS IS A SMALL MARKET IT'S A TRANSITIONAL MARKET FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE. IT IS THE ONLY MARKET AND THEY ARE THERE FOR A LONG TIME FEES MIGHT BE ENTREPRENEURS. ARTISTS. MUSICIANS FREELANCERS OUT FARMERS AND RANCHERS IT'S REALLY CRITICAL FOR THOSE FOLKS THIS IS REALLY THE MARKET THAT THEY HAVE AND IT'S GOT TO BE STABLE AND IT'S GOING TO BE AFFORDABLE FOR THEM. I DON'T TALK A WHOLE LOT ABOUT THE PROTECTIONS THAT THE ACA BROUGHT TO THE INTERNAL MARKET BECAUSE I THINK AFTER THESE HEARINGS YOU PROBABLY ARE PRETTY FAMILIAR WITH THOSE. ON BUT AS WE THINK ABOUT THE WAY THE INDIVIDUAL MARKET HAS EVOLVED AND WHERE IT'S GOING OVER IN THE YEARS TO COME I THINK IT'S HELPFUL TO THINK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE ACA. IN SOME WAYS IS A. DALLEK KID IN GRAND BARGAIN BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT INSURERS AND CONSUMERS RIGHT SO ON THE ONE HAND THE GOVERNMENT SAID TO INSURANCE COMPANIES OKAY YOU'RE GONNA TAKE. SICK PEOPLE YOU HAVE TO TAKE THEM AND ACCEPT THEM GUARANTEED ISSUE YOU CAN'T CHARGE THEM A HIGHER RATE. ON YOU GOTTA COVER A PRETTY BASIC SET OF ESSENTIAL HEALTH BENEFITS BUT IN EXCHANGE WERE GONNA MAKE SURE YOU GET SOME HELP THE PEOPLE IN YOUR POOL THROUGH THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE. ON THEM ARE GONNA GIVE YOU THESE PREMIUM AND COST SHARING SUBSIDIES TO HELP MAKE THAT COVERAGE AFFORDABLE. WE SAID TO CONSUMERS WILL WE'RE GOING TO GIVE YOU THE SECURITY OF AFFORDABLE COMPREHENSIVE COVERAGE EVEN IF YOU HAVE PREEXISTING CONDITIONS BUT YOU CAN'T FREE RIDE OFF THE SYSTEM RIGHT YOU GOTTA SIGN UP BEFORE YOU GET SICK. YOU WILL THAT BARGAIN SUCH AS THAT IS. IS BEEN CHECKED IS BEING CHALLENGED. IS UNDER ACTIVE THREAT. WHETHER IT'S THROUGH THE REPEATED REPEAL A TIMES LAST YEAR AND AND POTENTIALLY FUTURE ONES AND THE CONGRESS. THE MORE RECENT SUCCESSFUL EFFORT TO REPEAL THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE. THE LOSS OF THE COST SHARING SUBSIDIES ON WHICH THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION POLL LAST YEAR. AS WELL AS RECENT EFFORTS. BY THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION TO ENCOURAGE THE EXPANSION AND SALE OF ALTERNATIVE INSURANCE PROJECT PRODUCTS THAT DON'T HAVE TO COMPLY WITH THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT THERE SIMPLY UNDER WRITTEN BECAUSE THEY CAN. DENY. POLICIES TO STICK PEOPLE ALL OF THOSE ISSUES ARE STARTING TO FRAY DIED. BARGAIN AND AND CAUSING. MANY INSURERS THAT ARE PARTICIPATING IN THE MARKETPLACE IS TO WONDER WHETHER THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT REMAIN A TRUSTED PARTNER. THAT'S AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT STATE LEVEL DECISIONS REALLY DO MATTER I'M CALIFORNIA'S A GREAT EXAMPLE OF THAT. WITH ROBUST PUBLIC OUTREACH AND. ENROLLMENT CAMPAIGNS EARLY DECISIONS THAT REALLY LIMITED SOME OF THE. CHALLENGES THAT SOME EXCHANGES ARE FACED WITH. SICK OR OVERLY SICK POPULATIONS. AND COVERED CALIFORNIA'S ACT OF PURCHASING MODEL OVERALL CALIFORNIA IS IN MUCH BETTER SHAPE THAN STATES WITH THE FEDERALLY RUN MARKETPLACES AND ALSO JUST A FEW INDICATORS OF THOUGHT SO. THIS SLIDE SHOWS ON PLAN PARTICIPATION IN THE FEDERALLY FACILITATED MARKETPLACE IS OUR FF I'M COMPARED TO COVERED CALIFORNIA. BETWEEN TWENTY FOURTEEN AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN YOU'LL SEE CALIFORNIA AND TWENTY FOURTEEN HAVE ELEVEN CARRIERS AND AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN HAVE ELEVEN CARRIERS. FOR THE ALPHA FOUND THAT AVERAGE JUST SLIPPED FROM FIVE CARRIERS PER STATE TO THREE. AND FORTY EIGHT PERCENT OF COUNTIES NATIONWIDE HAVE JUST ONE INSURER PARTICIPATING. NOW I WOULD SAY THIS REMARKABLE STABILITY THAT WE SEE IN COVERED CALIFORNIA DOES MASK SOME EXITS AND ENTRANCES WAS AYE UNITED HEALTHCARE LEAVE EARLY ON AN OSCAR COMMAND. IT ALSO MASKS SOME BIG REGIONAL CHANGES ON FOR EXAMPLE THE RECENT RETRENCHMENT OF BOTH ANTHEM AND HEALTH. NOT TO TAKE A MOMENT HERE AND DRILL DOWN A LITTLE BIT IN THE PLAN CHOICE THAT COVER CALIFORNIA ENROLLEES HERE ARE FACING AND I'D LIKE TO. THANK AND ACKNOWLEDGE THAT CALIFORNIA HEALTHCARE FOUNDATION AND THE WORK OF. ONE OF THEIR ANALYSTS KATY WILSON WHO REALLY HELPED ME PULL AND ANALYZE SOME OF THIS DATA. BUT I THINK WHAT YOU'RE SEEING HERE WITH THIS THIS SLIDE IS. THAT FOR THE FIRST TIME IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN ABOUT FIVE PERCENT OF COVERED CALIFORNIA AND COVERED CALIFORNIA ENROLLEES. ONLY HAVE ONE INSURER TO CHOOSE FROM. AND THERE'S BEEN A DECLINE FROM ALMOST HALF OF COVERED CALIFORNIA ENROLLEES HUMMING SIR MORE INSURER OPTIONS TO JUST TWENTY FIVE PERCENT HAVING SIX OR MORE OPTIONS. AND THIS SLICES SHOWS A. AT A LITTLE BIT HOW THE POPULATION IS AFFECTED BY THIS. AND I APOLOGIZE FOR THE VERY SMALL FONT. BUT HOPEFULLY YOU CAN SEE THAT. IT'S RELATIVELY FEW ENROLLEES IN THESE AREAS WITH FEWER CHOICES SIXTY SIX THOUSAND. COVER CALIFORNIA ENROLLEES HAVE ONE CARRIER. WITH THOSE THAT EFFECT CONCENTRATED IN IN MONTEREY SANTA BARBARA SAN LUIS OBISPO YOU COMPARE THAT WITH. MORE POPULATED AREAS SUCH AS LOS ANGELES COUNTY ON RETAINING A PRETTY ROBUST CHOICE OF INSURERS. OF COURSE ANOTHER IMPORTANT INDICATOR OF A MARKETS HEALTH OUR PREMIUM TRENDS. AND HERE AGAIN COVER CALIFORNIA IS DOING PRETTY DARN WELL. YOU'LL SEE HERE THAT THE AVERAGE PREMIUM GROWTH IN THE FEDERALLY FACILITATED MARKETPLACE VERSUS COVERED CALIFORNIA. IN BOTH PLACES BETWEEN TWENTY FOURTEEN AND TWENTY FIFTEEN STARTED BETWEEN SORT OF THREE AND FOUR PERCENT. ENROLLMENT I'M SORRY PREMIUM GROWTH. BUT BY TWENTY EIGHTEEN. THE PREMIUM GROWTH IN THE ITEM WAS THIRTY SEVEN PERCENT WARS AND COVERED CALIFORNIA WAS JUST TWELVE POINT FIVE PERCENT. AND I THINK THAT REALLY DOES BEGAN POINT TO SOME OF THE STRONG POLICY DECISIONS ON THAT THE STATE MADE EARLY ON. AS WELL AS ALONG THE WAY. OF COURSE AND A AS WITH EVERYTHING IN HEALTHCARE YOU'VE TO DRILL DOWN A LITTLE BIT. THESE AVERAGES THE STATE WIDE AVERAGES DO YOU MASK IMPORTANT REGIONAL VARIATIONS. SO FOR EXAMPLE MUCH BIGGER PREMIUM INCREASES IN THE NORTHERN COUNTIES. THIRTY THREE PERCENT BETWEEN SEVENTEEN TO SEVENTEEN AND EIGHTEEN COMPARED MUCH LOWER. INCREASES IN MORE URBAN AREAS LIKE SACRAMENTO AND SAN FRAN. SO WHAT'S DRIVING INSURER DECISIONS HERE AND WE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO GO OUT IN THE FIELD LAST YEAR AN INTERVIEW A WIDE RANGE OF ENSURE. BENEATH ABOUT WHAT. WAS CAUSING THEM TO NO LONGER PARTICIPATE OR TO CONTINUE PARTICIPATING IN THE MARKET PLACES AROUND THE COUNTRY. AND AT THE FIRST THING  WOULD JUST SAY IS THAT INSURERS HERE ARE NOT MONOLITHIC IN THEIR APPROACH TO A LARGE NATIONAL FOR PROFIT CARRIER LIKE UNITED. IS LIKELY TO HAVE A VERY DIFFERENT APPROACH THAN A REGIONAL NONPROFIT WHICH AGAIN MIGHT HAVE A DIFFERENT APPROACH THAN OF FORMER MEDICAID ONLY PLAN OR AT THE BLUE CROSS BLUE SHIELD CARRIERS. AND THEY'RE OF COURSE REGIONAL DIFFERENCES ON IN MANY STATES THE BLUE CROSS BLUE SHIELD PLAN IS THE BACKBONE OR IN MANY CASES THE ONLY CARRIER ON THE EXCHANGE. BUT IN OTHER STATES SUCH AS IOWA THE BLUE CROSS PLAN NEVER SERIOUSLY CONSIDERED PARTICIPATING BUT WE DID PICK UP ON SOME I THINK IMPORTANT THEMES. AREN'T NUMBER ONE. FOR. CARRIERS NETWORK NETWORK NIGHT MY NETWORK BUILDING AND MAINTAINING THAT PROVIDER NETWORK AT AN AFFORDABLE PRICE CAN BE VERY CHALLENGING AND RURAL AREAS. OFTEN THERE'S ONLY ONE HOSPITAL SYSTEM OR PROVIDER THERE'S PROVIDER GROUP. THAT HAS AN EFFECTIVE MONOPOLY ON THAT CAN MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR THOSE CARRIERS. AND WE ALSO REALLY HER DIFFERENCES IN TERMS OF OVERALL APPROACH TO WE FOUND GENERALLY THAT CARRIERS THAT PRE A CA WERE. STRONGLY COMMITTED TO THE INDIVIDUAL MARKET OR HAD STRONG. SHARE IN AND LOW INCOME POPULATIONS PERHAPS BECAUSE OF MEDICAID BUSINESS HAVE TENDED TO STAY COMMITTED TO THE MARKET PLACES. ON CONVERSELY INSURERS THAT HAD A SMALL INDIVIDUAL MARKET PRESENCE BEFORE THE ACA OR WHOSE BUSINESS MODELS WERE VERY DEPENDENT ON RISK SELECTION OUR UNDERWRITING. HASN'T BEEN MOST LIKELY TO EXIT THE MARKET. AND OF COURSE ABILITY TO SET PREMIUMS ARE PRICE FOR RISK IS REALLY REALLY CRITICAL AND. ONE THING ABOUT INSURANCE COMPANIES IS THERE THAT KIND OF RISK AVERSE. IF IF. IF THAT'S TIME MIGHT SURPRISE YOU BUT IT'S TRUE. BUT PRICING FOR RISK IS. CAN BE CHALLENGING IN RURAL AREAS AND SOME OF THAT IS JUST THE LACK OF POPULATION DENSITY SO FOR EXAMPLE THERE IS A COUNTY IN OHIO THAT. FOR THE LONGEST TIME THEY COULDN'T GET AN INSURER TO GO IN THERE THERE WERE ONLY THREE HUNDRED AND TWENTY EIGHT. MARKETPLACE ENROLLEES IN THAT COUNTY WELL JUST ONE PERSON WITH HEMOPHILIA OUR A NEO NAY BABY OR AN ORGAN TRANSPLANT CAN TOTALLY THROW OFF YOUR ACTUAR THE ASSUMPTIONS IN YOUR PRICING STRATEGY. AND THE RISKS FOR CARRIERS THERE ARE COMPOUNDED BY THE FACT THAT THEY HAVE TO SUBMIT THEIR PREMIUMS FOR REGULATORY REVIEW CLOSE TO A YEAR BEFORE THEY'RE ACTUALLY IMPLEMENT IT. SO THERE'S A LONG LAG TIME BEFORE THEY THOSE RATES ARE INTO FACT IN A LOT CAN HAPPEN BETWEEN WHEN YOU PUT THEM FORWARD FOR REGULATORY REVIEW AND WHEN YOU ACTUALLY USE THEM. AND OF COURSE THAT'S ONLY MADE MORE DIFFICULT AND AND POLICY ENVIRONMENT THAT'S VERY UNCERTAIN AND THAT CAN CHANGE ON YOU AT ANY MOMENT AND THE DECISION OF THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ON THE COST SHARING SUBSIDIES IS JUST ONE EXAMPLE OF. I'M BUT SHOULD WE CARE RIGHT. WE ULTIMATELY SAW ALL COUNTIES IN THE COUNTRY COVERED THIS YOUR I'M AND MAYBE IT'S OKAY IF AN INSURANCE COMPANY HAS A MONOPOLY IN A GIVEN AREA ON MAYBE THAT THAT'S GOOD FOR THEM RIGHT THEY. CAN SET THEIR PRICES AS HIGH AS THEY WANT. BUT IN GENERAL I'M WE SEE THAT THERE ARE REAL BENEFITS FOR CONSUMERS WHEN OUR PLAN CHOICES. CERTAINLY FIRST AND FOREMOST AFFORDABILITY AND WE'LL SEE AND I'LL SHOW YOU IN A COUPLE MORE SLIDES MORE INSURERS MEANS. LOWER PRICES ALSO AT LEAST IN THEORY. IT KNOWING THAT YOUR CUSTOMERS CAN VOTE WITH THEIR FEET EVERY YEAR PROMISE INSURERS TO PAY MORE ATTENTION TO CUSTOMER SERVICE AND IMPROVE QUALITY. BUT THERE ARE ALSO RISKS. THE WAY THE MARKET PLACES ARE STRUCTURED. YOU TO MAINTAIN THE VALUE OF YOUR PREMIUM TAX CREDIT CONSUMERS HAVE TO SHOP AND THEY HAVE TO SHOP EVERY SINGLE YEAR. THAT MAKES IT MORE LIKELY THEY'RE GOING TO SWITCH PLANS SWITCH NETWORKS BECOME THERE'S MORE OPPORTUNITY FOR CONSUMER CONFUSION BENEFIT DESIGN CHANGES. ALL THAT CAN AFFECT OVERALL QUALITY OF CARE AND THE CONTINUITY OF CARE PARTICULAR FOR PEOPLE WITH CHRONIC CONDITIONS. SO THESE NEXT TWO SLIDES I'M I HAVE TO GIVE CREDIT TO THE URBAN INSTITUTE FOR THIS REALLY. SORT OF DROVE DOWN INTO THE AFFORDABILITY ISSUE AND THE IMPACT OF COMPETITION ON AFFORDABILITY. SO WE'LL JUST SEE HERE ON THE SHOWS THE AVERAGE BENCHMARK MONTHLY PREMIUM BY ENSURE PARTICIPATION SO FOR. AREAS WITH JUST ONE INSURER THE AVERAGE MONTHLY PREMIUM IS ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY ONE DOLLARS A MONTH. BUT IN AREAS WITH SIX OR MORE INSURERS THAT DROPS TO TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY DOLLARS A MONTH. SO MORE CARRIERS TENDS TO MEAN LOWER PRICES WITH THAT SORT OF KEY CUT POINT I THINK BETWEEN TWO AND THREE CARRIERS. AND THIS SLIDE JUST CLOSE UP SHOWS A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT. ANGLE ON THAT SHOWING MEDIUM PERCENT SHEEN'S IN THE BENCHMARK PREMIUM BETWEEN TWENTY SIXTEEN AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN NOW PREMIUMS WENT UP ACROSS THE BOARD AND TWENTY. SEVENTEEN BUT YOU'LL SEE THAT. AREAS WITH JUST ONE ENSURE HAD AVERAGE PREMIUM INCREASES OF THIRTY PERCENT. WHEREAS. IT COUNTIES WITH ONLY WITH SIX OR MORE CARRIERS HAD INCREASES OF ONLY FIVE PERCENT. SO IS WE LOOKED ACROSS THE STATES CONFRONTING. CHALLENGES WITH SINGLE ISSUE ARE BARE INSURER COUNTIES. WE REALLY SAW A WIDE RANGE OF STATE ACTIONS. AND. AND THAT'S WITHOUT ALONG A CONTINUUM FROM. MORE GOVERNMENT. FOCUSED ACTIONS SUCH AS OUR MEDICAID BUY IN LEGISLATION IN NEVADA AND MINNESOTA TO. REQUIREMENTS DIED ON TO AND COMPANIES THAT IF YOU'RE GONNA PARTICIPATE IN THE STATE MEDICAID PROGRAM OR THE STATE EMPLOYEES BENEFIT PROGRAM YOU. HIDE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE MARKETPLACE AND A NUMBER OF STATES DID IT TOOK ON A NUMBER OF REGULATORY. EFFORTS TO MITIGATE THE RISK FOR CARRIERS. TO FOR EXAMPLE WASHINGTON AND HAS BEEN BE LOOKING AT THEIR OPERATING AREAS OHIO ALLOWED CARRIERS TO DROP GOLD LEVEL PLANS. IOWA GAVE CARRIERS ACCESS TO PREMIUM DATA THERE WERE A NUMBER OF ACTIONS THAT STATES HAVE TAKEN TO TRY TO MAKE THIS RISKY SITUATION LAST RISKY CARRIERS. OHIO GAVE INSURERS MORE FLEXIBILITY AND NETWORK DESIGN AND OTHERS OF COURSE JUST USED POLITICAL OR MORAL PRESSURE WHICH WORKED FOR TWENTY EIGHTEEN THAT MAY BE ON LESS SUSTAINABLE LONG TERM. WITH THAT I WILL CLOSE IN THE FIRST YEAR QUESTIONS. YOU VERY MUCH. OUR NEXT SPEAKER MISTER PERRIN. SHE'S. A LOT OF TABS HERE'S. MR PERUN IS THE DIRECTOR OF IMPROVING HELP IMPROVE ACCESS AT THE CALIFORNIA HEALTHCARE FOUNDATION WHICH WORKS TO ENSURE ALL LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS CAN GET THE CARE THEY NEED WHEN THEY NEED NEEDED. CHRIS OVERSEAS A FOUNDATIONS EFFORTS TO EXPAND ACCESS TO FOR. TWO FOR BOOK COVERS TO STRENGTHEN THE MEDICARE PROGRAM AND FOSTER DELIVERY SYSTEM TRANSFORMATION AND WORKFORCE SOLUTIONS THAT EXPAND THE CAPACITY OF SAFETY NETWORK INNOVATIONS PROVIDE TIMELY HIGH QUALITY. AND PATIENT CENTERED CARE. A PEROT WHEN YOU'RE READY RIGHT GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR WOULD CHAIR RAMBLE AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. AND THANKS TO THE INVITATION TO TALK WITH YOU TODAY ABOUT. MEDI CAL AND RELEASE ACCESS TO CARE. ALSO I WANTED THINK. THAT COMMITTEE STAFF FOR. ALL THE WORK YOU DATED IN HELPING US PREPARE FOR THIS HEARINGS MUCH APPRECIATED. AB THE CALIFORNIA HEALTHCARE FOUNDATION WE BELIEVE THAT ALL CALIFORNIANS SHOULD HAVE ACCESS TO COMPREHENSIVE AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE COVERAGE. AND WE'VE BEEN MONITORING ACCESS TO CARE IN THE MEDICAL PROGRAM FOR TWO DECADES. ARE PARTNERING WITH US IN THE TOP RESEARCHERS HERE IN CALIFORNIA AS WELL AS NATIONALLY. AND A ALSO PARTNER WITHOUT MANY DIFFERENT PARTNERS IN THE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTOR TO IMPROVE ACCESS TO COVERAGE IN CARE. FOR LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS. AND WE'VE ALSO PART IN RECENT YEARS WITH THE GOVERNMENT HEALTH CARE SERVICES TO SURVEY. MEDI CAL ENROLLEES. AND. TO DEVELOP DOSH FORCE TO BETTER MONITOR ACCESS TO CARE. A LOT FOR MY PRESENTATION TODAY I'M GOING TO BRIEFLY DESCRIBE A FRAMEWORK. FOR HOW WE THINK ABOUT. ACCESS TO CARE FOR. FOR ANYBODY REALLY BUT LOW INCOME POPULATIONS. AND THEN I'M GONNA SHARE SOME FINDINGS FROM OUR RESEARCH AND RESEARCH DONE BY OTHERS. AND FOCUS ON NON ELDERLY ADULTS SINCE THEY ARE THE FOCUS OF OUR EFFORTS TO EXPAND OUR COVERAGE OF THE REMAINING UNINSURED. WHEN FOCUS ON CALIFORNIA RESEARCH. AND. AND THEN FOCUS ON THE COMPARISON BETWEEN MEDI CAL. AND THE UNINSURED AND MEDICARE I'LL AND. THE INDIVIDUAL MARKET. SINCE AGAIN. THINKING ABOUT THE CHOICES THAT WE HAVE BEFORE US. I WANNA DISCUSS IT BRIEFLY SOME KEY PROGRAM FEATURES. IN THE MEDICARE PROGRAM THAT I THINK ARE IMPORTANT ADDRESSING ACCESS TO CARE FOR ANY LOW INCOME POPULATION. AND I BRIEFLY SUMMARIZE THE FOR. PRESENTING SOME OPPORTUNITIES FOR IMPROVEMENT. SO AS WE THINK ABOUT DIFFERENT WAYS. TO MEASURE. ACCESS TO CARE. WE WORKING WITH RESEARCHERS AT MATHEMATICA POLICY RESEARCH ABOUT THIS FRAMEWORK. LOOKS AT THREE AREAS POTENTIAL ACCESS ON WHERE THE CHARACTERISTICS OF OUR COVERAGE SYSTEM IN OUR HEALTH CARE TO LEASE THE RELEASE SYSTEM ARE THEY PROMOTING. A ACCESS TO CARE. REALIZE ACCESS WITH THE ACTUAL EXPERIENCE OF PEOPLE AND THEN FINALLY HEALTH OUTCOMES. WHEN WE START AT THE TOP SOME OF THOSE ARE THE MOST THE EASIEST MEASURES TO COLLECT THESE DATA TO COLLECT AND OFTEN THE MOST DIRECTLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE POLICY CHOICES THAT WE MAKE. AS WE WORK FARTHER DOWN THIS LIST. YOU GET INTO A NUMBER OF COMPLEXITIES IN TERMS OF ATTRIBUTION BOTH TO THE POLICY DECISIONS AND ALSO. THE COMPLEXITIES OF BOTH MEASUREMENT AND THE DIFFERENCES IN YEAH I DEFER POPULATIONS AND DISCUSS AND IT ON ALL THREE ELEMENTS. BEFORE A GETTING STARTED IN THIS CAME UP IN THAT. QUESTION AND AND A QUESTIONS TO. TO LARRY LEVAN ABOUT. MEDICARE POPULATIONS ANOTHER POPULATIONS THERE ARE IMPORTANT DIFFERENCES IN THE POPULATIONS ACROSS DIFFERENT COVERAGE TYPES. AND NEEDS HAVE AS VERY IMPORTANT LOCATIONS FOR WHAT WE SEE IN THE ACCESS DATA. SO WHEN WE COMPARE MEDI CAL. ENROLLEES TO THOSE WITH PRIVATE COVERAGE WE COMPARE THEM TO THE ENSURE ITS REALLY IMPORTANT UNDERSTAND THAT WE'RE NOT COMPARING APPLES TO APPLES. AND. WE CAN DIED A LITTLE DEEPER INTO THAT. ONE THER THING TO MENTION IS THAT. MIGHT IN MY PRESENTATION I AM NOT GOING TO TALK ABOUT CHILDREN FOR THAT PART PARTLY FOR THAT REASON I MENTION BEFORE WHERE ARE THE REMAINING UNDERSHIRT ARE. PREDOMINANT DEALT IN FACT NINETY PERCENT OF CHILDREN HERE IN CALIFORNIA. ARE COVERED I THINK A LARGE PART TO A NUMBER OF MEDI CAL EXPANSIONS. ON BUT WHAT I WOULD SAY ABOUT CHILDREN IS THAT THE RESEARCH. GENERALLY SHOW THAT CHILDREN AND MEDI CAL. THEIR EXPERIENCE OF ACCESS IS SIMILAR TO CHILDREN WITH EMPLOYER SPONSORED INSURANCE. AND TENDS TO BE MUCH BETTER THAN ADULT MEDI CAL ENROLLEES. WE HAVE SPECIAL PROTECTIONS FOR CHILDREN INCLUDING THE EARLY AND PERIODIC SCREENING DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT REQUIREMENTS. WE HAVE SPECIAL HIGHER PAYMENT RATES FOR SPECIALTY CARE AND THE CALIFORNIA CHILDREN'S SERVICES PROGRAM. SO THERE'S A NUMBER OF CONCEIVING FACTORS TO THE FACT THAT CHILDREN. ENJOY BETTER ACCESS THAN. ADULTS IN THE MEDICARE PROGRAM. IN THE LAST TWO YEARS. HOWEVER WE HAVE SEEN. AS SURPRISING RISE IN THE SHERIFF. PARENTS REPORTING DIFFICULTY FINDING SPECIALISTS UP FOR THEIR CHILDREN. WE ARE FORTUNATE D. H. YES IT'S CREATED A NEW DASHBOARD. TO MONITOR CHILDREN'S ACCESS TO HEALTH. IN IT SHOWS MIXED PICTURE STEADILY INCREASING UTILIZATION MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. BUT OPPORTUNITIES TO IMPROVE ACCESS TO AND USE OF DENTAL SERVICES AND SOME DECLINES IN QUALITY OF CARE OVER TIME SO I IMPORTANT POPULATION BUT WON'T BE THE FOCUS OF THE REMAINDER OF MY PRESENTATION. AT THE CALIFORNIA HEALTHCARE FOUNDATION WE HAVE BEEN FORTUNATE WORK WITHOUT DOCTORS ANY BY MEN AND DR AGENDA KAUFMAN TO. TRACK OVER ABOUT TWO DECADES PHYSICIAN PARTICIPATION IN THE MEDICARE PROGRAM USING A. HE'S. DEAD AND WE END WITH THE MEDICAL BOARD OF CALIFORNIA USING A SUPPLEMENTAL SURVEY THE PHYSICIANS ARE ASKED TO COMPLETE WHEN THEY RENEW THEIR LICENSES AND IT GIVES US A UNIQUE INSIGHT. INTO PHYSICIAN PARTICIPATION IN THE PROGRAM SOMETHING THAT FRANKLY WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THIS IN OTHER AT NATIONAL CAN BEATINGS OTHER STATES ARE REALLY QUITE JEALOUS OF. NOT WHAT WE FIND. FROM THIS WORK IS THAT ABOUT SIXTY FOUR PERCENT OF MEDI CAL ISCHEMIA PHYSICIANS CALIFORNIA PARTICIPATE IN THE MOAT AND AND MEDICARE PROGRAM AND SIXTY PERCENT. ACCEPTING NEW PATIENTS AND AS YOU CAN SEE THAT'S ARE QUITE A BIT LOWER THAN IT IS FOR OTHER FORMS OF INSURANCE AND QUITE A BIT ABOVE TO PARTICIPATION IN SERVING THE UNINSURED. I DOCTOR COFFIN ENTER TEAM IN THE LATEST SURVEY HAVE ALSO FOUND THAT. THE RATIO OF PHYSICIANS. TWO ENROLLEES IS. IN TWO THOUSAND AND FIFTEEN IS BELOW NOT ONLY NATIONAL GUIDELINES BUT ALSO THE DEPARTMENT'S OWN STANDARDS FOR ITS MANAGED CARE PLANS. SO WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH PHYSICIANS TO SERVE THE MEDI CAL POPULATION ACCORDING TO THE STATE'S OWN STANDARDS. I DO WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT DISPOSITION SUFFER PORTED DATA. THAT IN SOME REPORTED DATA IN GENERAL HAS ITS LIMITATIONS ARE WE HAVE EXAMINED A NUMBER OF OTHER WAYS TO TRACK POSITION PARTICIPATION THE PROGRAM INCLUDING FROM. I DRUG CLAIMS AND MEDICAL CLAIMS AND FOUND THIS TO BE A SUPERIOR METHOD. A FROM THE SAME SURVEY WE ASKED POSITIONS. WHY THEY DO NOT PARTICIPATE MORE IN THE MEDICARE PROGRAM AND WE FOUND THAT THE NUMBER ONE REASON? THAT PUBLIC TO NO ONE'S SURPRISE HIS PAYMENT. BUT THEY GET A NUMBER OF OTHER REASONS AS WELL AND WHEN WE TALK WITH. PHYSICIANS PARTICIPATING IN THE SAFETY NET ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE OFTEN HEAR IS A CONCERN OF THEIRS PROTECTING AMONG PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS. IS THE DIFFICULTY THEY HAVE REFERRING PATIENTS TO SPECIALTY CARE. IT'S ESPECIALLY CARE IS A PARTICULAR CHALLENGE FOR MEDI CAL ENROLLEES. ONE OF THE BENEFITS WE HAVE IN CALIFORNIA IS THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH INTERVIEW SURVEY. AS A GENERAL POPULATION SURVEY CONDUCTED ANNUALLY AND. IT ALLOWS US SOME VERY ROBUST. COMPARISONS BETWEEN DIFFERENT POPULATIONS INCLUDING MEDICAL POPULATIONS KNOWS WHAT OTHER SOURCES OF COVERAGE. AND HERE A FEW SLIDES TO COMPARE ACCESS TO CARE FOR MEDI CAL ENROLLEES TO OTHER PAYERS AND WE SEE THAT ACCESS TO CARE FOR ADULTS MEDI CAL ENROLLEES. IS GENERALLY COMPARABLE TO ADULTS IN THE INDIVIDUAL MARKET AND CERTAINLY MUCH BETTER THAN THE UNINSURED. ONE KNOW WHERE THE FINING REFLECTED IN THAT CHART IN THE UPPER LEFT IS THAT MEDI CAL ENROLLEES ARE. JUST AS LIKELY TO HAVE THE USUAL SOURCE OF CARE. AS THOSE WITH COVERS TO THE INDIVIDUAL MARKET THE WHERE THEY GET THEIR CARE IS DIFFERENT AS YOU CAN SEE THE MAJORITY OF MEDI CAL ENROLLEES SAY THEY GET THEIR CARE FROM HELL CENTER CLINIC. RIZZI MAJORITY OF THOSE IN THE INDIVIDUAL MARKET GET THEIR CARE CITY GET THEIR KAREN ADOPTERS OFFICE. AND THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH SOME DATA THAT WE'VE. HOW FROM MEDICARE MANAGED CARE PLANS THAT SAY FORTY PERCENT OF THEIR MEMBERS? GET THEIR CARE FROM FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTERS ARE LOOKALIKES. AND FIFTY PERCENT OF THE NEW NEWLY ENROLLED MEDI CAL MEMBERS. UNDER THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. NOW USING. THAT CALIFORNIA HEALTH SURVEY AYE INTERVIEW DATA AGAIN. LOOKING AT. TAKING A CLOSER LOOK AT SOME OF THE ACCESS WE SEE THAT ADULTS. AND RELEASE ARE LESS LIKELY TO FOR GARE FORIT FOR GO CARE. DUE TO COST. BUT HAVE MORE DIFFICULTY GETTING TIMELY CARE. SO WITH THAT SURVEY ASKED PEOPLE WHY WHETHER THEY FORGO CARE AND WHY THEY FOR GEAR FORGO CARE AND YOU CAN SEE THAT OTHER REASONS ARE QUITE DIFFERENT AND WE'RE GONNA GET INTO THOSE. IN JUST A BIT. ANOTHER LOOK AT THIS ISSUE OF TIMELY ACCESS IS FROM A STUDY DONE IN SACRAMENTO BY DOCTOR JOINED ON THE COUNTER TEAM UC DAVIS. USING A SECRET SHOPPER APPROACH THEY CALL THE OFFICES OF PHYSICIANS LISTED IN MEDI CAL HEALTH PLAN PROVIDER DIRECTORIES AS ACCEPTING NEW PATIENTS. THE BLUE BARS SHOW THE PERCENT OF PHYSICIANS WHO HAD ANY AVAILABLE APPOINTMENT. OFFER A NEW PATIENT. IN SOME COUNTIES ONE HALF OF THOSE CONTACTED SAID THEY HAD AN AVAILABLE APPOINTMENT WELL IN OTHER AREAS AS FEW AS ONE IN FOUR PHYSICIANS. HAD AN AVAILABLE PLANE AGAIN ONLY PHYSICIANS WHO SAID THEY WERE ACCEPTING NEW PATIENTS WERE CONTACTED AS PART OF THE STUDY. THE ORANGE BAR SHOWS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THOSE SAME POSITION OFFICES WERE ASKED WHETHER. THEY HAD ANY APPOINTMENT WITHIN TEN DAYS. WITH ANY PROVIDER IN THE PRACTICE SO THE FIRST QUESTION WAS JUST ASKING ABOUT A PARTICULAR PROVIDED IT WAS JUST IN THE PROVIDER DIRECTORS ACCEPTING PATIENTS THE SECOND QUESTION SAYING. ANY PROVIDING A PRACTICE CAN I GET IN WITHIN TEN DAYS WHICH IS. STATE STANDARD FOR PRIMARY CARE. IN MOST CASES THE VALUE DROPS DRAMATICALLY INDICATING THE POSITIONS CANNOT MEET THIS I NEED IN A TIMELY MANNER. AND ONE COUNTY YOU BUT THAT THAT PERCENT ACTUALLY RISES. A THIS REFLECTS THAT IN SOME CASES. EVEN THOUGH THE ORIGINAL PHYSICIAN MAY NOT HAVE AN INVALID VALVE APPOINTMENT ANOTHER PHYSICIAN TO PRACTICE. DOES. EMERGENCY ROOM USE IS CERTAINLY A HOT TOPIC IN MEDI CAL. ONE THAT PEOPLE PLAY CLOSE SCRUTINY TO AND PART BECAUSE IT CAN OFTEN BE A SIGNAL OF POOR ACCESS AND. AND ALL AND ALSO BECAUSE OF ITS HIGH COST. NOT THESE FIGURES SHOWN ON THIS PAGE REFLECT THE PERCENT OF PEOPLE BY COVERS TYPE THAT VISITED D. E. D.. AT LEAST ONCE IN THE PAST YEAR. AND AS YOU CAN SEE MEDI CAL ENROLLEES RECEIVED SIGNIFICANTLY MORE LIKELY TO VISIT THE E. D. THAN THOSE WHAT OTHER SOURCES OF COVERAGE. AND ALSO MORE LIKELY THAN THE UNINSURED WHO OFTEN AVOID ANY TYPE OF COSTLY CARE. A CLOSER LOOK AT THE AD THAT TO DATE HOWEVER REVEAL THAT THESE DIFFERENCES ARE LARGELY A REFLECTION OF DIFFERENCES IN THE POPULATIONS. SO WHEN WE LOOK AT JUST THOSE UNFAIR POOR HEALTH WE SEE THAT GAP BETWEEN MEDI CAL AND THESE OTHER. PAYERS SHRINK AND WE CONTROL FOR BOTH. A HEALTH STATUS IN DISABILITY WE SEE THE GAP. SHRINK EVEN FURTHER SO OFTENTIMES THE DIFFERENCES THAT WE SEE IN ACCESS ARE NOT SO MUCH A FUNCTION OF THE PROGRAM BUT OF THE POPULATIONS THEY SERVE IN THE VARIETY OF CHALLENGES THEY FACE IN THEIR LIVES. I DECIDED CHARTS. WHICH LOOKS AT JUST THE MEDICAL POPULATION TOUCHES ON A SIMILAR ISSUE. YOU CAN SEE THAT AMONG THE MEDICARE POPULATION WITHIN THE MEDICAL PROPOSITION THERE A WIDE DIFFERENCES IN THEIR EXPERIENCES GETTING ACCESS TO CARE. THIS IS NO BY NO MEANS A COMPREHENSIVE LOOK AT THIS ISSUE. BUT IT DOES HIGHLIGHT THAT. THAT THE PROGRAM IS SERVING DIFFERENT ENROLLEES IN DIFFERENT WAYS. BOTH IN TERMS OF THEIR CHARACTERISTICS AND AND ALSO GEOGRAPHICALLY. SINCE NINETY PERCENT MEDI CAL. AND RELEASE ARE NOW SERVE TO MANAGED CARE PROGRAM I THOUGHT TO BE INTERESTING SPENT LITTLE TIME ON USELESS AND LITTLE TIME ON THE MANAGED CARE PROGRAM. OF THIS FIRST SLIDE COMES FROM THE DEPARTMENT HEALTH CARE SERVICES' OWN MEDI CAL MANAGED CARE PERFORMANCE DASHBOARD. THOUGHT AND IT SHOWS THE TREMENDOUS VARIATION IN PERFORMANCE. ACROSS MANAGED CARE PLANS IN MEDI CAL. THAT THE NAMES OF THE PLANS ARE PROBABLY TOO SMALL TO SEE BUT I HOPE THE MAJOR POINT ISN'T LOST. THAT THERE IS THIS TREMENDOUS VARIATION. AND THAT. WHAT WE SEE ERE IS THAT THERE ARE SOME PLANS FOR WHOM THAT ARE PROVIDING EXCELLENT QUALITY OF CARE? ENOUGH ALL MEDI CAL ENROLLEES WERE IN PLANS A PROVIDED THAT LEVEL OF QUALITY AND ACCESS. THERE WOULD BE A MUCH GREATER ACCESS TO PRIMARY AND PREVENTIVE CARE FOR ALL MEDICAL ENROLLEES. AGAIN LOOKING AT THE MEDI CAL MANAGED CARE PROGRAM. MEMBER WALDRON. REFERRED TO. THE HE JUST A DATA SET QUALITY AYE DATA. THAT IS. ESTABLISHED BY THE NATIONAL COMMITTEE FOR QUALITY ASSURANCE. AND THIS LOOKS AT SIX OF THE MEASURES THAT THE DEPARTMENT HAS. DECIDED TO USE IN WHAT'S CALLED ITS AUTO ASSIGNMENT ALGORITHM THIS AS AN OUT OF THIS IS AYE AYE METHOD BY WHICH THE DEPARTMENT. TAKES IN RELEASE YOU DON'T USE A HEALTH PLAN THEMSELVES. AND USES TO ASSIGN THOSE BENEFICIARIES TO A HEALTH PLAN WHAT ESSENTIALLY MEANS IS THAT HE'S OF THE SIX MEASURES THAT D. H. YES WITH THAT STAKEHOLDERS THAT IS A REALLY KEY MEASURES FOR US IN TERMS OF MEASURING QUALITY SITE AYE AMONG THE MANY MEASURES THAT WE COULD LOOK AT. THIS IS WHY. I'M LOOKING AT THE SIX HERE TODAY. AND WHAT YOU CAN SEE IS THAT THE QUALITY OF CARE AND MEDICARE MANAGED CARE IS SIMILAR TO THE NATIONAL MEDICAID AVERAGE. BUT NOT IMPROVING. AND THERE'S A COUPLE OF OF WAYS TO LOOK AT THIS. THIS ISSUE ON THE ONE HAND WE WOULD HOPE TO SEE CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT IN THE PROGRAM OVER TIME IN MANAGED CARE. THAT IS A LARGELY A CHARGE OF THE PROGRAM. ARE ON THE OTHER HAND GIVEN THE RAPID GROWTH IN THE PROGRAM. AT IN THE LAST FEW YEARS. IT MIGHT BE SOME SMALL COMFORT COMFORT THERE HASN'T BEEN A SERIOUS DECLINING QUALITY THERE CERTAINLY BEEN CALLS AND QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT. MEDICAID PROGRAMS NATIONALLY CAN HANDLE BOTH THE TRADITIONAL MEDICAID POPULATION EXPANDED POPULATION AND THE STATE IT WOULD SUGGEST THAT THE QUALITY OF CARE HAS NOT DETERIORATED FOR MEDI CAL DURING THIS PERIOD BY MARCH. I WANTED TO ALSO MENTION THE PUBLIC PLANS PLAY A VERY UNIQUE ROLE IN THE MEDICARE PROGRAM. A YOU CAN SEE THE EIGHT REPRESENT THE THREE. BLUE R. BLUISH LIKE SEGMENTS OF THIS. THIS CHART HERE SO THEY ACCOUNT FOR MAJORITY OF THE MEMBERS. BUT EVEN MORE THAN THAT WHEN WE COMPARE THE PERFORMANCE OF THE PUBLIC PLANS TO THE COMMERCIAL PLANS PARTICIPATING IN MEDICARE I'LL. IN THOSE COUNTIES. WHERE THERE ARE BOTH KINDS OF PLANS I GENERALLY THE PUBLIC PLANS PERFORM BETTER AND WHEN WE HAVE LOOKED TO SEE WHAT INVESTMENTS? A HEALTH PLANS ARE MAKING IN THEIR COMMUNITIES TO IMPROVE THEIR DELIVERY SYSTEMS GENERALLY WHAT SERVICES IS A LARGE INVESTMENTS BY PUBLIC PLANS THIS IS NOT UNIVERSALLY TRUE. SOME PLANS ARE TAKING A MORE ACTIVE ROLE THAN OTHER BUT GENERALLY SPEAKING IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT THE PUBLIC PLANS ARE ARE TAKING A DEEPER AND LONGER TERM INVESTMENTS IN THEIR COMMUNITIES. SO I WANT TO MENTION SEVERAL FEATURES OF MEDI CAL THAT ARE INTENDED TO PROMOTE BETTER ACCESS BECAUSE I THINK THIS IS IMPORTANT CONSIDERING. ANY TYPES OF COVERAGE OPTIONS THAT YOU GIVE TO LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS. THE FIRST IS THAT MEDICAID IS A VERY EXPANSIVE BENEFIT. INCLUDING DENTAL COVERAGE AND TRANSPORTATION SERVICES. THAT HAS NO OR LOW PREMIUMS AND COST SHARING. THERE ARE NUMEROUS LEGAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE PROTECTIONS FOR MEDI CAL ENROLLEES I MENTIONED THE EPT AT EP STT REQUIREMENTS BEFORE. THERE ARE HIGHER PAYMENTS FOR SELECTED PROVIDERS. UNDER THE CALIFORNIA CHILDREN'S SERVICES FOR ATHLETIC QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTERS FOR EXAMPLE. AND THEN THERE'S UNIQUE ENROLLMENT OPTIONS SO THERE'S YEAR ROUND ENROLLMENT IN MEDI CAL. WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT IS NOT AVAILABLE ON THE INDIVIDUAL MARKET OR THROUGH EMPLOYER SPONSORED INSURANCE. I ALSO WANTED TO MENTION THE MOST MEDI CAL ENROLLEES HAVE A POSITIVE PERCEPTION OF THE PROGRAM SO DESPITE. MANY OF THE CHALLENGES WHEN YOU ASK BENEFICIARIES ABOUT THEIR EXPERIENCE. IN GENERAL THEY SAY IT'S GOOD. WHEN YOU ASK THEM ABOUT THE PERCEPTION THAT IT CAL MOST SAY IT'S EITHER A VERY GOOD PROGRAM. OR PRETTY GOOD PROGRAM. NOW THIS WAS A SURVEY THAT WAS DONE BEFORE THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT WAS ENACTED BEFORE THE EXPANSION. WE DID THIS SURVEY IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE DEPARTMENT HEALTH CARE SERVICES WE WOULD. APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO IT AGAIN I'D LOVE TO PARTNER WITH THEM TO DO THAT. BUT SO FAR HAVE NOT HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO SO. BUT DISS. WAS A STATE WAS A STATE OF THE ART SURVEY THAT LOOKED ACROSS A LOT OF THE SURVEY DATA AND THAT IT CAL AND RELEASE FOCUSES ONLY ON THE MANAGED CARE POPULATION IN THIS LOOKED AT BOTH A MEDIC. THE MANAGED CARE AND THAT AND THE FEE FOR SERVICE POPULATION WHICH IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE FEE FOR SERVICE POPULATION INCLUDES. A LOT OF SENIORS PEOPLE DISABILITIES WHO REQUEST TO RECEIVE MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS. SO THIS IS JUST A SUMMARY OF THE FINDINGS. IN THE INTEREST OF TIME I WON'T REPEAT THEM HERE. BUT. I WILL ADD THAT WHILE MEDI CAL DOES FACE SOME BIG CHALLENGES AND MEDICAL AND RELEASE ARE CERTAINLY MUCH BETTER OFF. BECAUSE OF THE PROGRAM. AND THEN I WANTED TO LEAVE WITH SOME IDEAS FOR IMPROVING ACCESS. THE FIRST IS THAT THERE'S CLEARLY AN OPPORTUNITY TO IMPROVE HEALTH PLAN PERFORMANCE AND ONE SIMPLE IDEA. IS TO THAT COULD HAVE GREAT IMPACT IS TO PAY THEM DIFFERENTLY. FOR EXAMPLE EXAMPLE JUST AS MANY MEDI CAL HEALTH PLANS. PAY THEIR PROVIDERS WITH A PAY FOR PERFORMANCE BONUS AND WE COULD DO THE SAME IN THE STATE PAYING HEALTH PLANS MORE THAT ARE IMPROVING. QUALITY AND ACCESS PERFORMING BETTER AND PAYING THOSE LAST THE DOWN. A SECOND IS TO ENCOURAGE PLANS TO EXPAND ACCESS TO TELEHEALTH. THE PUBLIC HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS IN SAN FRANCISCO AND LOS ANGELES HAVE USE ELECTRONIC CONSULTATIONS AND REFERRAL SYSTEMS WITH GREAT IMPACT. REDUCING UNNECESSARY SERVICES AND VISITS TO SPECIALISTS THAT COULD BE AVOIDED. AND CUTTING OFFMONTHS OF WAITING TIMES FOR THOSE THAT NEEDED SPECIALTY CARE. SIMILARLY LIVE VIDEO AND STORED FOR TELEHEALTH R. CONNECTING BOTH RURAL AND URBAN. PIPED UP PROVIDERS WITHOUT SPECIALISTS. AND IMPROVING ACCESS TO THOSE AREAS ARGUABLY ANY PLANET SERVING AND. RURAL POPULATION OR RECEIVING AN EXEMPTION FROM THE NETWORK ADEQUACY A TIMELY ACCESS GENDER SHOULD HAVE A ROBUST TELEHEALTH PROGRAM TO BETTER MEET THE NEEDS OF THEIR ENROLLEES. A THIRD THROUGH. ITS WAIVER THE MEDICAL PROGRAM HAS BEEN INVESTING BILLIONS IN THE TRANSFORMATION OF CARE DELIVERY. SYSTEMS THROUGH THE PUBLIC YOU SEE AN DISTRICT HOSPITALS. I IN THE STATES SUBS USED DELIVERY SYSTEM SUCH EFFORTS TO BUILD THE CAPACITY. WE NEED NOW ARE IMPORTANT AYE IN THE AND NOW IN THE FUTURE AND SHOULD BE EXPANDED UPON. TIED TO INCLUDE VALLEY QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTERS. FOURTH WE NEED TO INVEST IN BUILDING A WORKFORCE FOR THE FUTURE. ONE THAT EMPHASIZES PATIENTS CENTER TEAM BASED CARE ASSEMBLYMAN WOULD AND SENATOR HERNANDEZ ARE SERVING ON THE CALIFORNIA FUTURE HEALTH WORKFORCE COMMISSION AND I HOPE. THAT THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THAT. COMMISSION WILL BE DISCUSSED IN ACTED UPON. AND THEN FIFTY FINALLY FOR ALL THAT WE DO TO TRACK NETWORK ADEQUACY TIMELY ACCESS TO HEALTH OUTCOMES. WE COULD AND SHOULD DO BETTER AYE I REALLY ACTUALLY APPLAUD THE EFFORTS BY THE DIRECTOR DIRECTOR SHELLEY REGARDED HER TEAM TO ADVANCE BETTER MEASUREMENT. OF ACCESS AND BRING GREATER TRANSPARENCY. THIS WORK SHOULD. CONTINUING BE EXPANDED UPON. THANKS FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY AND I'M AND I PARTICULAR. NEXT WE HAVE JANET KAUFMAN WHO'S AN ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR AT UC SAN FRANCISCO SCHOOL OF MEDICINE. SHE WORKS OUT THE FULL OF HARDLY INSTITUTE FOR HEALTH POLICY STUDIES THE HEALTH FORCED CENTER AS WELL AS THE DEPARTMENT OF FAMILY AND COMMUNITY MEDICINE. AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SAN FRANCISCO. WITHOUT FURTHER ADO THANK YOU FOR JOINING US TIME AND THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBER AROUND LOIS THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBER WOULD AND THAT THE WHOLE COMMITTEE AND AND ESPECIALLY THANK THE STAFF FOR THEIR GUIDANCE IN PREPARING THIS PRESENTATION. NOT SO I'M GONNA TALK ABOUT ACCESS TO PHYSICIANS IAN IN CALIFORNIA AND I THINK IT'S. FITTING THAT MR PROTEIN IRE UP FOLLOWING ONE ANOTHER BECAUSE I WHILE HE'S GIVEN YOU SOME VERY VALUABLE INFORMATION FROM OUR WORK ON PHYSICIAN PARTICIPATION IN MEDICARE HOW. MICHAEL WAS STE TO GIVE YOU A BROADER CONTEXT. AND NOW WHILE WE COULD CERTAINLY. HEARING MANY DIFFERENT TYPES OF PROFESSIONALS IN THE HEALTHCARE WORKFORCE. IN CONSULTATION WITH THE COMMITTEE STAFF. WE THOUGHT WAS IMPORTANT FOCUS ON PHYSICIANS BECAUSE SO MUCH OF THE CARE THAT IS DELIVERED IN OUR SYSTEM. IS DRIVEN BY THE DECISIONS POSITIONS MAKE AROUND DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT PLANS AT ALL. I SO I'M GONNA REALLY GIVE YOU A HIGH LEVEL OVERVIEW OF CURRENT SUPPLY GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION TALK A LITTLE ABOUT MEDICAL EDUCATION. UP WANT TO SPEND A FEW MINUTES ON CONTRIBUTIONS OF NURSE PRACTITIONERS IN A PHYSICIAN'S ASSISTANTS TO PRIMARY CARE BECAUSE THEY DO PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLES PARTICULARLY. IN RURAL AND INNER CITY AREAS AND THEN TALKS ABOUT STRATEGIES FOR MEETING. OPPOSITION WORKFORCE NEEDS ARE IN THE STATE. MUCH OF THIS. THAT ARE PRESENT WILL. COME FROM RESEARCH THAT WE HAVE NOT CONDUCTED. FOR THE CALIFORNIA HEALTHCARE FOUNDATION OTHER FUNDERS I'M I'M GONNA PERCENT SOME FINDINGS FROM THE EIGHTY SECOND SURVEY THE MEDICAL BOARD DOES THE MANDATORY. SURVEY AYE IN THIS SURVEY AYE IS DONE UNDER THE AUSPICES OF E. BE. UP FIFTEEN EIGHTY SIX. A BILL YOUR PREDECESSORS APPROVED IN TWO THOUSAND ONE AND AND I WILL TELL YOU THAT THERE TO WHEN WE PRESENT. OUGHT TO NATIONAL AUDIENCES FOLKS ARE IMPRESSED AT THE ARRAY OF DATA THAT WE HAVE ON PHYSICIANS IN THE STATE AND AND I THINK IN FACT IN SOME OTHER PROFESSIONS FOLKS. WISH WE HAD ANYTHING WHERE NEAR THE DATA NO NURSING WOULD BE AND I THINK THE ONLY PROFESSION WERE QUITE. SAME LEVEL IN CALIFORNIA. I'VE SO POSITION WORKFORCE OF FIVE ARE A KEY FINDING SPIKE KEY THINGS TO REMEMBER. UP ONLY FIFTY ONE PERCENT OF PHYSICIANS IN CALIFORNIA WHO HAVE A CALIFORNIA LICENSE PROVIDE PATIENT CARE. IN CALIFORNIA SO WE HAVE TO BE REALLY CAREFUL WHEN WE LOOK AT THE NUMBER OF LICENSEES. IT'S AN OVERSTATEMENT ABOUT ONE THIRD OF OUR PHYSICIANS ARE PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS AND TWO THIRDS ARE SPECIALISTS AND WHILE THERE MULTIPLE WAYS TO DEFINE PRIMARY CARE. OUR TEAM DEFINES IT ADDS FAMILY MEDICINE GENERAL INTERNIST GENERAL PEDIATRICIANS AND DIED GENERAL PRACTICE AND THAT'S PRETTY WIDELY ACCEPTED DEFINITION. POINT THREE GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION OF PHYSICIANS ACROSS CALIFORNIA IS HIGHLY UNEVEN WILL SAY WILL MORE ABOUT THAT. FOURTH OUR PHYSICIANS DO NOT REFLECT THE DIVERSITY OF OUR POPULATION. AND FIFTH MANY PHYSICIANS ARE LIKELY TO RETIRE WITHIN THE DECADE THE NEXT DECADE PARTICULARLY. IN RURAL AREA SO THERE IS A SILVER TSUNAMI IN THE GENERAL POPULATION ISN'T MEMBER WALDRON ALLUDED TO BUT THERE'S ALSO SO PERSON ARMY AMONG PHYSICIANS. SO THIS IS JUST TO REINFORCE THE POINT I MADE A ABOUT THE NEED TO RECOGNIZE THAT MANY PHYSICIANS WERE LICENSED TO PRACTICE IN CALIFORNIA. DON'T PROVIDE PATIENT CARE IN THE STATE SOME OF THE MAINTAIN THEIR LICENSE BUT THEIR NORMAL BUT THE RETIRED THEY THEY WANT TO HOLD ON TO THE LICENSE THE MONEY TO WILL VOLUNTEER WORK. BUT THEY'RE NOT ACTIVELY PRACTICING OTHERS. PRACTICE IN OTHER STATES BUT THEY ONE HOLD ON TO THE CALIFORNIA LICENSE. SUMMER STILL IN TRAINING THEY HAVEN'T COMPLETED THAT RESIDENCY YET AND SO THEY HAVE A LICENSE BUT THEY'RE NOT. A FULL MEMBER OF THE WORK FORCE JUST YET. I'M SO BASED ON RESPONSES TO THE MANDATORY SURVEY WE ESTIMATE THAT THERE ABOUT SEVENTY ONE. THOUSAND POSITIONS WITH THE CALIFORNIA LICENSE WHO PROVIDE PATIENT CARE. AND OF THOSE ABOUT SIXTY ONE THOUSAND PROVIDE PATIENT CARE TWENTY OR MORE HOURS PER WEEK SORTS A REALLY BIG PART OF THEIR WORK WEEK NORMAN IN ACADEMIA WHERE I'M FROM WE'VE A LOT OF PHYSICIANS. WHO DO PATIENT CARE MAYBE ONE MAYBE TWO DAYS A WEEK AND SPEND THE REST OF THEIR TIME DOING RESEARCH AND TEACHING? I AM SO THIS GRAPH. DIVIDES THE STATE INTO TEN DIFFERENT REGIONS AND PLOTS RATIOS OF PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS AND SPECIALISTS POSITIONS TO POPULATION. THE REASON WE PLOT THE RATIOS RATHER THE NUMBERS IS AS YOU KNOW VERY WELL. THE POPULATION OF THE DIFFERENT REGIONS OF OUR STATE VARIES TREMENDOUSLY WE HAVE VERY DENSE URBAN CORES LIKE SAN FRANCISCO IN VERY WORLD PLACES AND MR AROUND WHAT MISTER WOODS DISTRICTS AND OTHER DISTRICTS. IN SO PUTTING THEM ON THE RATIO POPPER CAPITA YOU GIVES YOU A SCALE WHERE YOU CAN MAKE MEANINGFUL COMPARISONS. AND ONE OF THE KEY THINGS WE SEE HERE IF WE LOOK AT THE PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS IN GOLD AND THE SPECIALISTS IN BLUE. IS THAT. THE INLAND EMPIRE. NORTHERN IN SIERRA AND SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY REGION'S TEND TO HAVE SOME OF THE LOWEST RATIOS OF BOTH PRIMARY CARE AND SPECIALIST POSITIONS TO POPULATIONS OF SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY. INCLUDES FRESNO COUNTY. MR RAMBLERS DISTRICT NORTHERN SIERRA. INCLUDES MUCH OF MISTER WOODS DISTRICT EXCEPT PERSON NO MECHANIC WHICH IS IN THE GREATER BAY AREA SO LOT OF VARIATION YET EVEN MORE VARIATION RATIO SPECIALIST A POPULATION. OUGHT THEN PRIMARY CARE. BUT IT'S IMPORTANT TRAIL DOWN BELOW THE REGIONAL AREA BECAUSE WHEN WE LOOK AT THESE MULTI COUNTY REGION'S IT'S MAY ASKING VARIATION EVEN WHEN WE LOOK AT A PLACE LIKE LOS ANGELES. OUGHT COUNTY. WITHIN THAT COUNTY THERE'S QUITE A WIDE VARIATION IN SUPPLY AND SO THIS IS A MAP PREPARED BY THE OFFICE OF STATEWIDE HEALTH PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT. OF PRIMARY CARE HEALTH PROFESSIONS AYE SHORTAGE AREAS AND I APOLOGIZE THAT'S. CUTTING OFF ON THE SCREEN A LITTLE BIT BUT I'M THE PARENT HEALTH PROFICIENCY ORTIZ AREAS THESE ARE AREAS DESIGNATED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IN PARTNERSHIP WITH POSH BID. AYE THAT ARE DEEMED TO HAVE CRITICAL SHORTAGES IN THIS CASE CRITICAL SHORTAGES OF PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS AND SO THIS MEANS THESE ARE AREAS THAT HAVE FEWER. THAN ONE PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN POORER THIRTY FIVE HUNDRED PEOPLE WHICH IS ABOUT LESS THAN TWENTY NINE PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS PER ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND. POPULATIONS OF THIS IS QUITE LOW. I'M. AND IF WE LOOK AT THIS MAP THE AREAS THAT ARE IN THE RUST COLOR ARE A PRIME MAKERS SHORTAGE AREA FOR THE WHOLE POPULATION THAT MEANS ANYBODY WHETHER YOU'RE INSURED UNINSURED. WHETHER YOU HAVE PRIVATE INSURANCE MEDICARE MEDI CAL THERE'S A SHORTAGE THE CREAM COLORED AREAS ARE AREAS WHERE THERE'S A STORAGE OF PROVIDERS WILLING TO SERVE A PARTICULAR POPULATION COULD BE MEDI CAL BENEFICIARIES COULD BE FARMWORKERS COULD BE UNINSURED. I'M SO THINK POINTING GEOGRAPHICALLY THE VAST MAJORITY THE SERIES ARE IN RURAL AREAS HOWEVER IF YOU NOTICE IF YOU LOOKED DOWN. SEE WHERE LOS ANGELES COUNTY IS MUCH OF THE COUNTY IS ADEQUATE BUT THERE'S SOME LITTLE POCKET YOU KNOW SMALL POCKETS. OF SHORTAGE IN THOSE ARE PLACES LIKE THE HIGH DESERT IN PARTICULARLY SOUTH CENTRAL BOYLE HEIGHTS INNER CITY. AREAS AND SO YES GEOGRAPHICALLY MOSTLY WORLD BUT LET'S NOT BUT IMPORTANT TO NOT FORGET THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF FOLKS IN INNER CITY AREAS. THAT HAVE SHORTAGES OF PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS. THIS OUR MAP IS FOR MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS. THAT PURPLE ARE AREAS THAT HAVE A SHORTAGE OF MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS FOR ALL THE POPULATIONS OF THIS WOULD BE PSYCHIATRISTS PSYCHOLOGISTS. LICENSED CLINICAL SOCIAL WORKERS OTHERS THERAPIST. THE. BLUISH PURPLE THE LIGHTER COLOR THAT'S A SHORTAGE IS FOR PARTICULAR SEGMENTS OF THE POPULATION. AGAIN. OR MORE RURAL PARTS OF THE STATE. R. I HEAR COVERED THE. THE MORE RURAL PARTS OF OUR STATE ACCOUNT FOR THE LARGEST GEOGRAPHIC AREAS THAT HAVE SHORTAGES BUT AGAIN WE SEE SOME INNER CITY AREAS ALSO STRUGGLING WITH SHORTAGES OF MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS. I'M. RACIAL ETHNICALLY DIVERSITY ISSUE WELL KNOW WE ARE ONE OF THE MOST RACIALLY ETHNICALLY DIVERSE AYE STATES IN THE NATION. R. PHYSICIAN WORKFORCE NOT SO MUCH OF WE LOOK ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE OF THE SLIDE THAT'S THE CALIFORNIA POPULATION IN TWENTY FIFTEEN. ACCORDING TO THE CENSUS BUREAU AT THAT TIME SIX PERCENT OF OUR POPULATION. WAS AFRICAN AMERICAN THIRTY EIGHT PERCENT OF LATINO AND WE SEE IF WE LOOK ON THE LEFT SIDE THAT'S ALL PHYSICIANS IN THE NEXT TO THAT PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS. FOUR PERCENT OF OUR PHYSICIANS ARE AFRICAN AMERICAN VERSUS SIX PERCENT OF THE POPULATION AND IF WE LOOK AT LATINOS SOME EVEN BIGGER GRAPHS SEVEN PERCENT OF PHYSICIANS ARE LATINO VERSUS THIRTY EIGHT PERCENT OF THE POPULATION. I PUT NURSE PRACTITIONERS AND PHYSICIAN ASSISTANTS ON THE SCRAP AS A BENCH PREGNANCY. EIGHT BOTH ARE BETTER IN TERMS OF PROPORTIONAL ATENAS BUT STILL NOWHERE NEAR POPULATION. PARITY WHY DOES THIS MATTER WHY I THINK WE PRETTY GOOD EVIDENCE THAT PEOPLE OFTEN FORM STRONGER BONDS WITH A HEALTH PROFESSIONAL OF THE SAME RACE ETHNICITY. AND THE FOLKS AT HER COMMON CULTURAL BACKGROUND AND OFTENTIMES A COMMON LANGUAGE MAY BE ABLE TO COMMUNICATE BETTER WITH A HEALTH PROFESSIONAL. ABOUT THEIR HEALTH CONDITION AND BE MORE WILLING TO TRUST THE ADVICE THAT THEY'RE GIVEN. EACH DISTRIBUTION OF ACTIVE PATIENT CARE PHYSICIANS SO TWENTY SEVEN PERCENT OF REACTIVE PATIENT CARE PHYSICIAN SO THESE ARE PHYSICIANS WHO PROVIDE PATIENT CARE TWENTY OR HOURS A WEEK. TWENTY HOURS PER WEEK OR MORE SO TWENTY SEVEN PERCENT OF THEM. WANT A LITTLE MORE THAN ONE IN FOUR ARE AGE SIXTY. OR OLDER AND NOW SOME OF THEM WILL KEEP WORKING FOR MANY YEARS BUT A LOT OF THEM AT THE AS THEY REACH INTO THEIR SEVENTIES WERE EITHER RETIRE OR SUBSTANTIALLY CUT BACK THEIR WORK HOURS. I'M IN SOME REGIONS OF THE STATE HAVE PERCENTAGES OF DOCTORS AGE SIXTY YEARS OR OLDER THAT ARE EVEN HIGHER SO THE NORTHERN AND SIERRA THAT WOULD BE MISTER WOODS DISTRICT THIRTY SEVEN PERCENT OVER A THIRD. OUR AGE. SIXTY OR OLDER. THIRTY TWO PERCENT IN THE CENTRAL COAST AND ABOUT THIRTY PERCENT IN LOS ANGELES IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY. AND IN GENERAL IT'S HARD TO SAY THAT RURAL AREAS OF THE STATE TEND TO HAVE OLDER PHYSICIANS ARE THEY IN URBAN AREAS. A FEW FACTS ABOUT MEDICAL EDUCATION AND IT HAS YOU KNOW. POSITIONS FIRST COMPLETE MEDICAL SCHOOL AND THEN GO ON TO COMPLETE A RESIDENCY PROGRAM. ARMS SHOW IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN THE LATEST YEAR FOR WHICH. I HAVE COMPLETE DATA ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY ONE PEOPLE GRADUATED FROM A CALIFORNIA. MEDICAL SCHOOL. IN OVER TWO THIRDS ABOUT ELEVEN THOUSAND OF THOSE WERE FROM AN ALLOPATHIC IN INDY GRANTING SCHOOL SO THAT WOULD BE THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA MEDICAL SCHOOLS LOMA LINDA STANFORD UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. AND THEN WE HAVE TO OSTEOPATHIC DO GRANTING SCHOOLS THOSE NUMBERS ARE GOING TO GO UP BECAUSE WE SEVERAL MEDICAL SCHOOLS. THAT ARE HAVE EITHER STARTED TO ENROLL OR WILL BEGIN TO ENROLL STUDENTS IN THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS. RESIDENCY WE HAVE ABOUT TWO SOUTH WE HAVE TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY FOUR FIRST YEAR MEDICAL STUDENTS. IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND RESIDENTS ITS REALLY IMPORTANT TO LOOK AT RESIDENCY DATA BECAUSE. WHERE A PERSON DOES HIS OR HER RESIDENCY IS A MUCH STRONGER PREDICTOR OF WHERE AVAIL PRACTICE? OUGHT THEN WHERE THEY GO TO MEDICAL SCHOOL A LOT OF PEOPLE MOVE AROUND A LOT OF OUR CALIFORNIANS GO OUT OF STATE. FOR MEDICAL SCHOOL AND THEN COME BACK FOR RESIDENCIA RESIDENCIES RELATED IN TERMS OF GETTING FOLKS WHERE WE NEED THEM TO GO. THAT'S WHERE WE WANT TO FOCUS. IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN WE HAD ABOUT ONE THOUSAND WHO WERE FIRST YEAR RESIDENTS IN A NON PRIMARY CARE SPECIALTY. AND ABOUT FIFTEEN HUNDRED WHO WERE FIRST YEAR RESIDENTS IN A PRIMARY CARE SPECIALTY HOWEVER I NOTE THAT OF THOSE STARTING IN A PRIMARY CARE SPECIALTY. HAFER ARE LIKELY TO GO ON A SUB SPECIALISTS WHO SAY THEY DO A GENERAL INTERNAL MEDICINE RESIDENCY. AND THEN THEY GO ON THE SUB SPECIALIZED IN CARDIOLOGY ERGASTER NEUROLOGY IN IN THOSE ARE SURELY IMPORTANT SPECIALTIES BUT I THINK IN OUR STATE WE STRUGGLE THE MOST OF PRIMARY CARE SUPPLIES THAT WE NEED TO KEEP THAT AND WE NEED TO JUST. WHEN WE SEE THAT FIFTEEN HUNDRED NUMBER REMEMBER THAT NOT ALL FIFTEEN HUNDRED ARE GOING TO PROVIDE PRIMARY CARE. OKAY ROOM BRIEFLY CONTRIBUTIONS OF NURSE PRACTITIONERS AND PHYSICIAN AYE ASSISTANCE I'M SO MPS AND PAC ARE A MAJOR SOURCE OF PRIMARY CARE PARTICULARLY IN RURAL CARACALLA FORGET THEY DO PLAY IMPORTANT ROLE AND FILLING GAPS IN SOME OF OUR RURAL AREAS. WHERE CLINICS AND OTHER PROVIDERS STRUGGLE? AYE TO RECRUIT PHYSICIANS HOWEVER IT'S IMPORTANT KEEP IN MIND THAT NUMBERS HAVE BEEN PIECING PA'S IN CALIFORNIA ARE MUCH SMALLER. THEN THE NUMBERS OF PHYSICIANS AND SO WHY THINK IT'S CERTAINLY IMPORTANT TO LOOK AT INCREASING THEIR NUMBERS IT'S IMPORTANT RECOGNIZE THAT YOU'RE STARTING FOR A MUCH SMALLER BASE. IN OUR TEAM AT THE AYE UCSF MYSELF MY COLLEAGUE CHANCE BATS. HAVE JOHN SOME PROJECTIONS OF FUTURE SUPPLIES OF PRIMARY CARE NURSE PRACTITIONERS PHYSICIAN ASSISTANTS AND PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS. IN OUR CONCLUSION IS THAT NUMBERS OF PRIMARY CARE IN PEACE MPAS RESPECTED TOOK TO INCREASE PARTICULARLY IF INCREASES IN RISK OF IN IN ENROLLMENT. IN TRAINING PROGRAMS CONTINUE AT THE CURRENT PACE BUT THEIR GROWTH MAY NOT BE SUFFICIENT TO OFFSET THE PROJECTED DECREASE IN THE NUMBER OF PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS THAT ON THE POSITION SITE. WE'RE NOT TRAINING NEW PHYSICIANS AT THE SAME RATE AS FOLKS ARE EXITING THE PROFESSION. I MEAN THIS IS JUST TO HELP REINFORCE THAT POINT WHERE SOME DATA. WHEN WE ADD UP INDIES AND DE OWES THE TWO TYPES OF POSITIONS WE GET ABOUT THIRTY THOUSAND PRIMARY CARE. PHYSICIANS IN THE STATE I AM IF WE A OUT UP IN PEACE MPAS AND PRIMARY CARE. UP WE GET ABOUT. TWELVE I TWELVE THOUSAND THIRTEEN THOUSAND IT IN OTHER KEY THING HERE IS I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT LIKE PHYSICIANS. THERE ARE LARGE PROPORTIONS OF IN PEACE MPAS WHO ARE SPECIALISTS THEY DON'T ALL PROVIDE PRIMARY CARE AND IN FACT THERE'S A YOU KNOW BIG MARKET FOR WORK IN PEACE MPAS IN SPECIALTY CARRIED NATIONWIDE. A RECENT STUDY OF AB JOB ADVERTISEMENTS FOR IN PNP JOBS FOUND THAT THE MAJORITY OF JOBS FOR ON THE SPECIALLY SIDE SPECIALTY PRACTICES ALSO TEND TO PAY BETTER. I'M SO I DON'T THINK IT'S ANY SURPRISE THAT WE'RE SEEING YOUR PRE LARGE PROPORTIONS OF MPS MPAS GO THAT ROUTE. SO NOW LET ME COMMENT BRIEFLY ON STRATEGIES FOR MEETING PHYSICIAN WORKFORCE. NEEDS. IN THIS IS A TYPOLOGY THAT OUR COLLEAGUES AND I PREPARED OFF FOR A FORTHCOMING REPORT IN THERE DO THE TYPOLOGY IS KIND OF A WAY TO GIVE YOU A AWAY THE TAXI GIVE FOUR BIG BUCKETS OF STRATEGIES THAT COULD BE UTILIZED. TO. ADDRESS POSITION WORKFORCE CHALLENGES IN CALIFORNIA IN THE FIRST IS ENHANCING THE EDUCATIONAL PIPELINES INCREASING THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE. ENTERING MEDICAL SCHOOL OTHER HEALTH PROFESSIONS THAT PROVIDE PRIMARY CARE. VERTICALLY FOCUSING AND IN ADDITION TO JUST PRODUCING MORE TARGETING AND FOCUSING ON FOLKS WHO ARE INTERESTED IN PROVIDING PRIMARY CARE. IN UNDERSERVED AREAS OF THE STATE AND PREPARING THE SPOKES TO PRACTICE EFFECTIVELY IN THOSE SETTINGS SECOND WOULD BE CREATING INCENTIVES FOR RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION A PRIMARY CARE FOR SPECIALS AND UNDERSERVED AREAS AND HAS WE TRAIN MORE. CREATING THE INCENTIVES AS THEY FINISH RESIDENCY REBA TRUCK TO GO TO THE PLACES WE NEED THE MOST. THIRD MAXIMIZING THE EXISTING WORKFORCE IN THAT'S NUMBER A LOT FOR A LOT OF THINGS TO CHRIS TALKED ABOUT. AROUND DELIVERY REFORM PAYMENT REFORM EXPANDED USE OF. TECHNOLOGY IN TELEHEALTH IN OTHER AREAS CAN ALSO ENCOMPASS AYE CHANGES IN STATE. OUR SCOPE OF PRACTICE REGULATION NEO SO THAT FOLKS ARE USED TO THE FULL EXTENT THEIR CAPACITY THERE ARE SOME PROFESSIONS MOST NOTABLY NURSE PRACTITIONERS WERE OUR SCOPE OF PRACTICE IS CONSIDERABLY MORE RESTRICTIVE THAN THAT OF MANY STATES. UP AND THEN LASTLY YOU KNOW BECAUSE I'M IN AT AN ACADEMIC WHO LIKES TO PLAY WITH DATA. LEVERAGING DATA AND I THINK NOT ONLY BECAUSE IT'S INTERESTING BUT BECAUSE IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW TO MAKE THEM SOUND DECISIONS ABOUT OUR WORKFORCE INVESTMENTS IT'S IMPORTANT TO COLLECT AND ANALYZE DATA SO THAT WE KNOW ARE THE THING ARE WE ARE THE THINGS THAT WERE. ARE OUR ATTEMPTS TO STE FIX THE PROBLEM REALLY WORKING. I AM SO FEW KEY TRADE OFFS THAT I THINK ARE IMPORTANT AS. OUGHT YOU THINK ABOUT INVESTMENT STRATEGIES IN THE PHYSICIAN WORKFORCE EIGHT I THINK EXPANDING TRAINING CAPACITY IN RECRUITING PEOPLE WHO WANT TO PRACTICE IN UNDERSERVED AREAS AND PEOPLE WHO REFLECT THE STATE'S. RACIAL ETHNIC DIVERSITY THESE ARE CRITICAL THESE ARE FUNDAMENTAL TO ADDRESS THE STRUCTURAL DEFICITS IN CALIFORNIA'S POSITION WORKFORCE. BUT IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT THESE ARE NOT QUICK FIXES. IN LARGE PART DUE TO THE LENGTH OF TRAINING THAT. MEDICAL SCHOOL TAKES FOUR YEARS WE HAVE A FEW EXAMPLES OF THREE OR PROGRAMS BUT THE MAJORITY OF FOLKS ARE DOING FOUR YEARS OF MEDICAL SCHOOL. AND AT LEAST THREE YEARS OF RESIDENCY AND MANY MORE THAN THREE YEARS AND SOME OF THE SPECIALTIES. AND SO WE NEED TO AUGMENT TRAIT STRATEGIES THAT FOCUS ON EXPANDING TRAINING. A PASSERBY WITH STRATEGIES THAT AS I SAID INCENTIVIZE NEW GRADS TO PRACTICE IN UNDERSERVED AREAS SUPPORT RETENTION OF POSITION IN THOSE AREAS. ENCOURAGE TEAM BASED PRACTICE SO THAT WHERE THERE ARE THINGS THAT ARE NECESSARY TO MEET PEOPLE'S PRIMARY CARE NEEDS THAT CAN BE DONE BY SOMEONE OTHER THAN THE POSITIONS THAT WERE DOING THAT IN A TEAM BASED WAY THAT COULD BE COMMUNITY HEALTH NURSE IT REGISTERED NURSES. COULD BE COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS ALL COACHES PHARMACISTS LOT OF FOLKS WHO COULDN'T DENTISTS. OR OVERTURN THE DENTAL HYGIENISTS. BUT THE IDEAS WE WANT WE DON'T HAVE A WHOLE TEAM SO THAT THE GOAL IS HOW TO WHERE HARRY BRINGING THE FULL TEAM TO BEAR. TO MEET HEALTH NEEDS AND NOT JUST ASKING THE PHYSICIAN TO DO ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING THAT'S JUST NOT. SUSTAINABLE. SEWER CONCLUSION REAL QUICKLY YES SOME RURAL INNER CITIES A CALIFORNIA HAVE SHORTAGES OF PHYSICIANS IN SOME PLACES IT'S NOT JUST. A SHORTAGE OF PHYSICIANS WILLING TO PARTICIPATE IN ANY PARTICULAR INSURANCE PROGRAM IT'S A SHORTAGE OF PHYSICIANS. AND IT THE SHORTAGES ARE LIKELY TO GET WORSE UNLESS THE STATE. TAKES ACTION AND CERTAINLY IN PEACE MPAS. ARE HELPFUL VERY IMPORTANT BUT THEY'RE NOT A PANACEA JUST RAMPING UP IN PNP TRAINING ISN'T GOING TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM WE NEED A COMPREHENSIVE STRATEGIC PLAN. THAT ENGAGES MULTIPLE STAKEHOLDERS AND AS AYE MR PRONE MENTIONED. THE CALIFORNIA FUTURE WORKFORCE COMMISSION IS WORKING ON JUST SUCH A COME CONGREGANTS OF PLAN AND URGE YOU TO. PARTICIPATE IN THOSE DELIBERATIONS. AND THANK YOU. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH DR KAUFMAN. WE WILL GO AHEAD AND MOVE ON TO DOCTOR JOHN GRAVES. WHO IS AN ASSISTANT PROFESSOR AT VANDERBILT VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE WHERE HE HOLDS APPOINTMENTS AND APARTMENT OF OF HEALTH POLICY IN THE PARCHMENT OF MEDICINE? IS INTERDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH FOCUSES ON THE DEVELOPMENT IMPLEMENTATION AND EVALUATION OF HEALTH CARE REFORMS AT THE STATE AND THE FEDERAL LEVEL. GRAVES THANK YOU WHAT'S A PRIVILEGE TO BE WITH YOU TODAY I'M. HAPPY TO HAVE MADE IT AYE NATIONAL HEADS ANNUAL SNOW STORM THIS WEEK WHICH IS CLOSE SCHOOL FOR SIX DAYS AND I SOMEHOW MADE IT OUT OF THAT WILL BE A CALIFORNIA. YEAH. SO OF MY ROLE. IN TESTIMONY TODAY IS TO REALLY PULL ON THE THREAT OF COVERAGE CHURN NOT ONLY IN CALIFORNIA BUT BASED ON MY OWN RESEARCH AND THAT OF OTHERS. IN THE UNITED STATES MORE BROADLY. AND WHAT I'D LIKE TO DO IS GO IS IS LAY OUT. SOME INFORMATION FOR YOU NOT ONLY ON THE PREVALENCE OF TRANSITIONS ARE TURNED OVER IN IN IN HEALTH INSURANCE UNITED STATES. BUT ALSO TALK ABOUT ITS CONSEQUENCES FOR ACCESS COSTS AND UTILIZATION AND THEN SPEND A FEW MINUTES TALKING ABOUT SHORT TERM AND LONGER TERM ISSUES THAT WILL COME UP. OF BOTH FEDERALLY AND AT THE STATE LEVEL. AND THAT YOU'LL NEED TO PAY ATTENTION TO. MOVING FORWARD AS YOU GO THROUGHOUT YOUR YOUR PROCESS HERE. SO JUST TO SET US ALL ON THE SAME STAGE. WHAT WE GENERALLY MEAN WHEN WE REFER TO CHURN IS TRANSITIONS IN HEALTH INSURANCE THAT ARE DUE TO CHANGES IN INCOME? A PERSON'S JOB CIRCUMSTANCES OR THEIR FAMILY CIRCUMSTANCES GETTING MARRIED DIVORCED ETCETERA. SO THIS IN THIS COULD BE ARE MOVING FROM EMPLOYER BASED PLAN. DUE TO A JOB CHANGE INTO A PERIOD WITHOUT HEALTH INSURANCE A COULD MEET MEAN MOVING FROM MEDICAID OUT INTO A COVER CALIFORNIA BECAUSE OF AN INCOME CHANGE IT CETERA. BUT IT CAN ALSO MEAN OTHER THINGS. SUCH AS ARE JUST TRANSITIONING FROM ONE EMPLOYER BASED PLAN TO ANOTHER AND I'LL GET INTO THAT A LITTLE BIT IN A MINUTE. SO THE TOP PLATE NUMBER I WANT YOU TO TAKE AWAY IS THAT BASED ON OUR RESEARCH WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT EACH YEAR ONE IN SIX U. S. ADULTS. CHANGE THEIR PRIMARY SOURCE OF HEALTH INSURANCE. THIS IS ACTUALLY A LOWER ESTIMATE BECAUSE THIS IS BASICALLY PEOPLE CHANGING THEIR THE SOURCE OF HEALTH INSURANCE WHETHER THAT'S TO AN EMPLOYER MOVING INTO THE MARKETPLACE OR BECOMING UNINSURED OR MOVING FROM MEDICAID TO OTHER MARKETPLACES ETCETERA. YOU CAN THINK OF THE ADDITIONAL MILLIONS OF PEOPLE A YEAR THAT ARE TRANSITIONING BETWEEN ARE THE SAME TYPE OF HEALTH INSURANCE FOR EXAMPLE FOR A WITH THE JOB CHANGE MOVING FROM ONE JOB TO ANOTHER. HAS A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT. HEALTH PLANS AND PROVIDERS FORMULAS IT'S ADDRESS THAT WOULD BE ON TOP OF THIS ONE IN SIX NUMBER THAT I'M SHOWING HERE. WE ESTIMATED USING SOME BACK OF THE ENVELOPE CALCULATIONS THAT FOR HERE IN CALIFORNIA OVER THE NEXT TWO YEARS ABOUT ELEVEN MILLION CALIFORNIANS ARE GOING TO CHANGE THEIR CURRENT SOURCE OF INSURANCE. AND IF YOU BREAK THIS DOWN THAT MEANS THAT ABOUT FOUR POINT TWO MILLION PEOPLE WHO TODAY OUR COVER TO AN EMPLOYER ARE GONNA TRANSITION OUT OF THAT EMPLOYER SPONSORED COVERAGE IN EITHER GOING TO COVER CALIFORNIA WILL BECOME ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICARE OUT. OR BECOME UNINSURED FOR SOME PERIOD OF TIME. ANOTHER FOUR MILLION WOULD COME OUT OF THE MEDICAL PROGRAM OVER THE NEXT TWO YEARS AND AGAIN GO INTO ONE OF THESE OTHER CATEGORIES. EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND. WOULD COME OUT OF. THEY'RE CURRENTLY IN THE COVER CALIFORNIAN A MARKETPLACE PLAN ARE GOING TO COME OUT OF THAT COVERAGE AND IT'S ESTIMATED BY COVER CALIFORNIA. THAT EVERY MONTH ROUGHLY FIVE TO TEN THOUSAND PEOPLE MOVE BETWEEN COVERED CALIFORNIA AND MEDICAL. I WANT TO KIND OF SET A BACKDROP BEFORE I TALK ABOUT THE IMPACT OF THE ACA ON COVERAGE TURN AND MOVING FORWARD. ON BY DISCUSSING WHY IT IS WE'RE SEEING MORE AND MORE TRANSITION OR TURN OVER IN THE U. S. HEALTH INSURANCE. ONE KEY FACT ON THE CONTRIBUTES TO THIS IS THE FACT THAT ARE IN. THE THE U. S. HEALTH INSURANCE SYSTEM WELL FRAGMENTED IS BUILT ON THE CHASSIS OF EMPLOYMENT BASE TO HEALTH AND. AND WHAT WE'VE SEEN OVER THE LAST TWENTY YEARS IS A GRADUAL EROSION OF EMPLOYMENT BASED HEALTH INSURANCE. SO YOU CAN SEE ON THIS GRAPH IS THE BIT ABOUT TWENTY YEARS AGO IN NINETEEN NINETY NINE. TWO THIRDS OF NON ELDERLY AND. POPULATION IN THE UNITED STATES WAS INSURED THROUGH AN EMPLOYER. BY TWENTY FOURTEEN ON THE EVE OF THE COVERAGE EXPANSIONS ON OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT THAT NUMBER HAD GONE FROM SIXTY SEVEN PERCENT. DOWN TO FIFTY SIX PERCENT AND JUST TO GIVE YOU A SENSE OUR SUMS SLIDES THAT LARRY LEVITT SHOWED EARLIER SHOW THAT IN CALIFORNIA THAT FIFTY SIX OF THE NATIONAL AMBER CALIFORNIA'S EXCELLENT AT LOWER THAN THAT OF I BELIEVE FORTY EIGHT PERCENT. SO. WHAT ARE THE REASONS ARE CONTRIBUTING FACTORS TO THIS EROSION OF ON OF OF A PLAN IN PLACE INSURANCE? ONE IS THE FACT THAT EMPLOYERS ARE LARGELY STARTING TO GET OUT OF THE GAME. AS RISING HEALTHCARE COSTS TO PUT THE PINCH ON THEM THEY JUST DECIDED THAT OFFERING HEALTH INSURANCE IS A FORM OF COMPENSATION IS JUST SOMETHING THAT THEY CAN NO LONGER AFFORD AND SO ARE MORE AND MORE EMPLOYERS ARE DECIDING NOT TO OFFER HEALTH INSURANCE BENEFITS TO THEIR EMPLOYEES. ANOTHER REASON IS MOBILITY IN THE U. S. OUR LABOR MARKET WHEREAS ONE OR TWO GENERATIONS AGO AN INDIVIDUAL MIGHT HAVE TWO OR THREE JOBS OVER THE COURSE OF THEIR LIFETIME. NOWADAYS IT'S NOT UNCOMMON TO HAVE EIGHT NINE TEN JOB CHANGES OVER. OVER YOUR WORKING. LIFE YEARS AND SO WITH THAT COMES CHANGES IN EMPLOYMENT YOU MIGHT BE OUT OF A JOB FOR A FEW MONTHS OR AYE IN A WAITING PERIOD IF YOU STARTED A NEW JOB IN CANTON ROLE FOR ANOTHER. A FEW MONTHS. WANTS THAT JOB STARTS. ANOTHER CONTRIBUTING FACTOR IS THE SO CALLED GET ECONOMY IN JUST THE RISE OF THE OF THE USE OF CONTINGENT* R. ARE. CONTRACTED WORKERS. AND SO IN THAT CASE THOSE ARE INDIVIDUALS THAT WOULD HAVE TO GO OUT AND PURCHASE COVERAGE ON THEIR OWN BECAUSE THEY'RE UNDER CONTRACT THEY'RE NOT ACTUALLY EMPLOYEE OF A FIRM THAT WOULD OFFER THEM HEALTH INSURANCE BENEFITS. SO WHAT WE FOUND IN OUR RESEARCH IS THAT IF YOU THINK ABOUT INDIVIDUALS THAT CURRENTLY HAVE. POLICY THROUGH THEIR EMPLOYER ABOUT A QUARTER OF THEM ARE GOING TO TRANSITION OFF OF THAT POLICY OVER THE NEXT TWO YEARS. AND THAT'S A RISE OF ABOUT TEN PERCENT SINCE THE EARLY TWO THOUSANDS SO THAT COULD EITHER MEAN BECOMING UNINSURED ARE GOING INTO DIFFERENT COVER SITE OR COULD MEAN JUST SIMPLY SWITCHING PLANS. GOING TO NEW JOB WITH EMPLOYMENT BASED HEALTH INSURANCE. THE POPULATION GROUPS THAT ARE MORE LIKELY TO EXPERIENCE THIS TYPE OF CHURN PERHAPS NOT SURPRISINGLY YOUNG ADULTS LOW INCOME ADULTS HISPANIC ADULTS. MORE SURPRISINGLY TO US ADULTS IN FAIR POOR HEALTH ARE MORE LIKELY TO EXPERIENCE TRANSITIONS OF COVERAGE AND SERVICE INDUSTRY WORKERS AS WELL. THOSE LESS LIKELY TURN TRANSITION ARE OLDER ADULTS MARRIED ADULTS FEMALES AND ADULTS WITH A COLLEGE DEGREE VOWED MENTIONED THAT THESE ADULTS. EVEN THOUGH THEY HAVE LOWER TRANSITION RATES STILL EXPERIENCE COVERAGE TRANSITIONS ON THE ORDER OF ONE IN FIVE OR TWENTY PERCENT OVER A TWO YEAR PERIOD SO IT'S NOT LIKE THEY'RE THEY'RE THEY'RE THEY'RE STAYING IN COVERAGE FOR LONG PERIODS OF TIME RELATIVE TO THESE OTHER. WHAT WE FOUND ALSO IS THAT LEADING INTO THE PERIOD? OF THE ACA. ONE MITIGATING FACTOR KEEPING A LOT OF THESE INDIVIDUALS FROM BECOMING UNINSURED. WAS THAT INCREASE AMERICANS ARE INCREASINGLY RELIANT WHEN THEY LOSE A JOB WITH HEALTH INSURANCE BENEFITS ON OBTAINING A COVERAGE THROUGH A FAMILY MEMBER. WHO THEMSELVES HAS A JOB WITH HEALTH INSURANCE BENEFIT? SO WHAT WE FOUND WAS THAT FROM TWO THOUSAND FORTY TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN THE LIKELIHOOD THAT A POP THAT SOMEBODY WITH THE POLICY AND EMPLOYMENT BASE POLICY. WAS ABLE TO FIND A NEW JOB WITH HEALTH INSURANCE BENEFITS WENT DOWN BY FIFTEEN PER SE. AT THE SAME TIME THE PROBABILITY THAT THAT POLICY HOLDER. WAS ABLE TO GET COVERAGE THROUGH A FAMILY MEMBER AFTER THAT JOB CHANGE INCREASE TO FULL. NOW EMPLOYERS HAVE REALIZE THIS AND THEY'VE INCREASINGLY STARTED. IMPOSING SURCHARGES MAKING IT MORE EXPENSIVE FOR INDIVIDUALS TO COVER FAMILY MEMBERS OR IN MANY CASES RETIREES WE CERTAINLY HAVE THAT A VANDERBILT. MANY OF YOU MAY HAVE EXPERIENCES THAT ARE IN YOUR FAMILIES AS WELL. SO WITH THAT BACKS UP I'D LIKE TO. TO DISCUSS THE ACA AND ITS ROLE IN AFFECTING COVERAGE TURN IN THE UNITED STATES. THE FIRST TAKE AWAY FROM R. WORK IS THAT OVERALL CHURN RATES HAVE NOT REALLY CHANGED MUCH WITH THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT IN PLACE. NO WELL OVERALL CHURN RATES HAVE BEEN HAVE BEEN CHANGED THE NATURE OF THOSE THAT TURNED HAS CHANGED QUITE A BIT. WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS WE'RE SEEING INCREASED RETENTION PUBLIC PROGRAMS LIKE MEDICAL? AND FEWER PEOPLE BECOMING UNINSURED SO THESE TRANSITIONS FROM INSURANCE TO UNINSURED STATUS AREBECOMING LESS PREVALENT OVER TIME. IN IN THE WAKE OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. THE WAY TO THINK ABOUT THIS. IS WELL IS THAT UNDER THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT AMEND AMERICANS ARE SPENDING LESS TIME BEING ON ENSURE. IT'S THE WAY TO THINK ABOUT THIS IS TO THINK ABOUT ALL OF THE UNINSURED PEOPLE TODAY THAT OFTEN BECOME UNINSURED AT VARIOUS POINTS IN TIME SOME WALKS EXIT SOONER THAN OTHERS. A LOT SOME PEOPLE SPEND A LOT OF TIME ON THIS HIGHWAY BEFORE THEY. TEAM COVERAGE. WHAT WE'VE SEEN UNDER THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT IS THAT MORE PEOPLE ARE GETTING OFF THE EXIT SOONER? INTO THINGS LIKE NON GROUP COVERAGE LIKE OUT TO COVER CALIFORNIA THE MARKETPLACES THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE RED LINE IN THE BLUE LINE THERE'S THAT JUMP. THAT RED LINE WAS THE TWO YEARS PRIOR TO THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. TERMS OF THINKING ABOUT THESE CARS EXITING THE HIGHWAY FROM UNINSURED STATUS INTO THE MARKET PLACES AND THE BLUE LINE IS THAT TWO YEARS FOLLOWING THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT'S COVERAGE. LIKEWISE WE'VE SEEN THE SAME DYNAMIC WITH MORE PEOPLE THAT WERE UNINSURED OBTAINING. PUBLIC COVERAGE. SOONER. IN IN PROGRAMS LIKE MEDICARE AGAIN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE RED LINE BEING THE PRE ACA LINE AND THE BLUE LINE BEING. POST A CA LINE. THERE'S TWO OTHER THOUGHT DYNAMICS THAT A CHANGE WITH THE AFFORDABLE OR NOT CHANGED WITH AFFORDABLE CARE ACT I SHOULD SAY. ONE CONCERN OF A EXPANSIONS A PUBLIC COURAGEOUS IS THAT THERE ARE GOING TO BE INDIVIDUALS THAT HAVE AYE. TO EMPLOYER BASED OFFER OF INSURANCE BUT WHO ALSO BECAUSE OF THEIR INCOME WOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR THAT PUBLIC OPTION IT FOR THAT PUBLIC PUBLIC COVERAGE IN WOULD TAKE IT UP BECAUSE IT'S CHEAP. THIS IS KNOWN AS CROWD OUT THE IDEA BEING THAT. ITS IT'S. ABOUT YOUR UTILIZING TAX RESOURCES TO GIVE INDIVIDUALS COVERAGE THAT WOULD HAVE COVERAGE THROUGH AN EMPLOYER THE PRIVATE SECTOR WOULD A PROVIDED THEM ANYWAY SO TO COVER ALL OF THE UNINSURED. IT TAKES MORE. IT TAKES MORE THAN JUST COVERING THOSE UNINSURED BECAUSE THEY'RE GOING TO BE INDIVIDUALS THAT COULD HAVE GOTTEN AYE COVERAGE ELSEWHERE ON THE PRICE. WHAT WE'VE ACTUALLY SEEN IN THIS WAS A CONCERN A WITH ANY COVERAGE EXPANSION LET ALONE JUST THE ACA? IS THAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY HAS NOT BEEN VERY MUCH EVIDENCE OF THIS CROWD OUT WITH THE IN PARTICULAR EXPANSES OF MEDICAID TO LOWER INCOME ADULTS. ANOTHER DYNAMIC WE'VE SEEN. IS THAT TRANSITIONS FROM EMPLOYER BASED COVERAGE TO UNINSURED STATUS HAVE NOT CHANGED. WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE LOSING THEIR PLAYER BASE POLICIES FOR WHATEVER REASON WHETHER THEY DON'T KNOW ABOUT IT WHETHER THE SUBSIDIES ON AND OFF? OR WHATEVER IT IS THEY'RE JUST NOT FINDING THE MARKET PLACES OR EVEN PUBLIC COVERAGE AN ATTRACTIVE OFFER TO THEM AND THIS IS BEEN A SURPRISE TO US. I LIKE TO SPEND A COUPLE MINUTES TALKING ABOUT THE CONSEQUENCES OF HAVING SET THE STAGE FOR HOW MUCH TURN THERE'S AN ASSIST. SOME RESEARCH FROM OTHERS ARE CALLING UP AT HARVARD PUBLISHED LAST YEAR. FOUND THAT INDIVIDUALS ARE TRANSITIONING OFF OF PRIVATE PLAN. THEIR UTILIZATION OF PRIMARY CARE SERVICES WENT UP FORTY SEVEN PERCENT IN THE MONTHS FOLLOWING THAT TRANSITION FROM A PRIVATE PLAN. INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE TRANSITIONING OFF OF MEDICAID THEIR PRIMARY CARE UTILIZATION WENT UP TWO HUNDRED AND THREE PERCENT. AND THEN LEVELED OFF EVENTUALLY OVER TIME. EDIE VISITS AMONG THOSE A SWITCHING OFF OF THE MEDICAID PROGRAM WHAT FIFTEEN PER. AND THIS SPEAKS TO OUR A COMMON THEME THAT WE HEARD TODAY. WHICH IS THAT AS YOU'RE TRANSITIONING FROM ONE PLANT TO ANOTHER A ONE PLAN TO UNANSWERED STATUS. THERE'S NOT ONLY ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS THAT GO ALONG WITH THAT BUT CHANGES IN BENEFITS STRUCTURE CHANGES AND PROVIDER NETWORKS AND THAT'S REALLY PLAYING OUT INTO HAVING TO ESTABLISH. REALLY REESTABLISH CARE RELATIONSHIPS IN A NEW PLAN WITH A PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN IN THIS CASE OR JUST NOT BEING ABLE TO QUICKLY NAVIGATE THIS NEW HEALTH CARE SYSTEM THAT YOU'RE. THAT YOU YOU'RE IN WHEN YOU WEEDS FOR EXAMPLE TRANSITION OFF OF MEDICAID AND JUST SHOWING UP IN THE E. D. BECAUSE IT'S A LITTLE BIT EASIER THAN FINDING. A AN APPOINTMENT. ONE STRATEGY THAT. I'M SURE YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT THAT INSURERS ARE INCREASINGLY TURNING TO AS A WAY TO SAVE ON BOB PLAYING POSSUM PREMIUMS ASSIST TO TURNING TO NARROW NETWORKS AND AGAIN THIS IS GONNA ACT OF THE FINDINGS FROM THE PREVIOUS SLIDE. BUT RESEARCHERS FOUND IS THAT EVEN. THAT NEVER NETWORKS CAN SAVE THE CAN LOWER PREMIUM COSTS INDIVIDUALS. BUT ALL OF THE SAVINGS ARE CONCENTRATED AMONG PEOPLE WHO ARE ABLE TO MAINTAIN THEIR PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN AFTER THEIR SWEAT. AGAIN SPEAKING TO THESE ISSUES OF OF INCREASE UTILIZATION AS PEOPLE RE NAVIGATE THE SYSTEM UNDER A NEW PLAN. ONE SURVEY OF INDIVIDUALS ARE CHURNED ENOUGH THREE STATES KENTUCKY ARKANSAS AND TEXAS. SELF REPORTED ARE A THIRD OF THEM SELF REPORTED EITHER SKIPPING DOSES OF THE MEDICATIONS ARE STOP TAKING MEDICATIONS DURING THE PERIOD WHERE THEY EITHER DIDN'T HAVE INSURANCE. OR IN ADDITIONAL SIXTEEN PERCENT HAD TO CHANGE THEIR MEDICATIONS BECAUSE OF CHANGES THAT FORMULA. JOHN IS VERY IMPORTANT. AS WE IN PARTICULAR AS WE THINK ABOUT. COVERAGE PROVIDED TO THE MARKET PLACES I IN TERMS OF ITS IMPACT ON ACCESS TO AND CONTINUITY OF CARE. ONE DYNAMIC THAT HAS BEEN I THINK A LITTLE BIT UNDER REPORTED IS THAT MANY MARKETPLACE PLANS OFFER VERY LITTLE OUT OF NETWORK COVERAGE. THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE ALL OF THE FINANCIAL PROTECTIONS PUT IN PLACE BY THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT WHETHER THAT'S. THE ELIMINATION OF LIFETIME A BENEFIT CAPS OF THE ANNUAL. CAPS ON INDIVIDUALS OUT OF POCKET SPENDING ALL OF THIS FINANCIAL PROTECTION VIGT THAT THE ACA PUT IN PLACE. DO NOT APPLY TO ANY CARE RECEIVED OUT OF THAT WORK IN YOUR PLAN. SO WHAT YOU SEE IS AND THIS. PLOT ON THE LEFT HAND SIDE OF THE TOP ONE IS FOR PRIMARY CARE THIS IS THE PERCENTAGE OF SILVER PLANS WITH NO OUT OF NETWORK COVERAGE FOR PRIMARY CARE ON THE TOP. IF URGENT CARE ON THE BOTTOM. THE TWENTY FOURTEEN THE FIRST YEAR THE MARKET PLACES ABOUT HALF OF THE SILVER PLANS OFFERED NO OUT OF NETWORK THERE WERE HMO PLANS THAT OFFER NO OUT OF NETWORK COVERAGE FOR. PRIMARY CARE IN ABOUT A THIRD OF THEM OFFERED NO OUT OF NETWORK COVERAGE IF YOU WERE SEE AWAY FROM HOUSING NEED URGENT CARE. YOU WERE AT THE WHIMS OF WHATEVER THEY CHARGED YOU IT WAS NOT CONSIDERED AN THAT WORK. WITH YOUR EAR PLAN WOULD NOT COVER SOME PORTION OF IT. BY TWENTY EIGHTEEN THESE NUMBERS ROSE FROM. FORTY SEVEN PERCENT IN TWENTY FOURTEEN FOR PRIMARY CARE TO ABOUT SIXTY SEVEN PERCENT FOR PRIMARY CARE. IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN. AND ABOUT SIXTY ONE PERCENT OF SILVER PLANS IN THE MARKETPLACES OFFERED NO OUT OF NETWORK COVERAGE IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN FOR URGENT CARE SERVICES. SO TO THE EXTENT THAT YOU TRANSITION FROM ONE PLAN TO ANOTHER AND WANT TO MAINTAIN ANY EXISTING PRIMARY CARE RELATIONSHIPS. THE FINANCIAL PROTECTIONS OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT ARE NOT PROTECTING YOU FROM WHATEVER COSTS THOSE NEIGHBORING. THE OTHER DYNAMIC THAT I'D REALLY LIKE TO EMPHASIZE IS THAT MANY OF US WHO ARE INSURED THROUGH AN EMPLOYER HAVE ACCESS TO PROVIDER NETWORKS WITH A VERY BROAD BROAD FOOTPRINT. EMPLOYERS GENERALLY TEND TO PICK PLAY OR OFFER PLANS THAT HAVE A WIDE PROVIDER FOOT PRINT. TO OFFER AS MANY CHOICES TO THERE AND IT TO THEIR. EMPLOYEES AS POSSIBLE. BUT WHETHER IT'S THE MARKET PLACES THROUGH THE RISE OF A NARROW NETWORKS OR EVEN IN THE MEDICAID PROGRAM WHERE NETWORKS TEND TO BE NEAR WHERE NOT ONLY BECAUSE THEY OF THE USE OF MANAGED CARE PLANS THAT HAVE. MORE RESTRICTED NETWORKS BUT ALSO DUE TO LOWER PARTICIPATION RATES IN MEDICAID RELATIVE TO PRIVATE PLANS. SO THAT THOSE OF US WATCHING OUT OF EMPLOYER PLANS AND INTO THESE OTHER. PLAN ARE REGION'S WHAT IF YOU MEDICAID OR THE MARKET PLACES ARE JUST FINDING MUCH MORE NARROW NETWORKS THAN WHERE YOU STILL AND THAT'S GOING TO HAVE. IT'S GONNA AMPLIFY OF THE IMPLICATIONS IN TERMS OF UTILIZATION AYE COSTS AS AS WE TRY TO RE NAVIGATE A A NEW HEALTH. PLAN. IN THE WAKE OF THE CHANGE. I'M GONNA GIVE YOU A VISUALIZATION IN JUST A MINUTE BUT I WANT TO SET YOU UP FOR THIS. JUST TO SHOW YOU HERE LOCALLY WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE FOR SOMEBODY CHANGING MARKETPLACE PLANS AND WHAT WOULD. WHAT WOULD MEAN FOR THEIR PRIMARY AND ACCESS TO PRIMARY CARE? YOU CAN THINK OF THIS VISUALIZATION HERE ON THE LEFT IS THIS KIND OF HUB AND SPOKE MODEL OF A OF A PRIMARY CARE NETWORK FURNITURE THE INSURER BEING THERE IN THE MIDDLE. IN VARIOUS PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS IN THE GEOGRAPHIC AREA. THAT ARE IN THAT WORK FOR THAT PLAN THERE IS THE SPOKES ARE COMING OUT OF THAT HUB. ON THE RIGHT YOU'RE GONNA SEE WHAT THAT'S GOING TO LOOK LIKE FOR HERE IN SACRAMENTO FOR ONE PLAN IS ACTUALLY GONNA BE KAISER. TO YOU CAN SEE THE IN NETWORK PCP IS THIS THE SMALL DOTS IN THE ENSURE THERE IN THE MIDDLE. THIS IS WHAT THE PRIMARY CARE NETWORK LOOKS LIKE FOR SACRAMENTO COUNTY AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN. AND WHAT YOU CAN SEE IS KAISER THERE'S A STAFF MODEL HMO BASICALLY EXISTING OUTSIDE OF. THE NETWORKS OF THE OTHER SYSTEMS. BUT IF YOU ARE FOR EXAMPLE INSERTED THROUGH SADR WHICH IS HERE ON THE LOWER. LEFT IN YOUR PRIMARY CARE WAS IN YOUR PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN WAS A NETWORK AND YOU WANTED TO SWITCH TO ANY ONE OF THESE PLANTS. IT'S VERY UNLIKELY THAT YOU WOULD FIND THE A PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN WAS IN THAT WORK FOR THOSE OTHER PLANTS. EVEN PLANS OFFERED BY THE SAME ENSURE SUCH AS ANTHEM HERE. WE'RE GONNA HAVE VERY DIFFERENT PROVIDER NETWORKS. AND IF THIS IS VICENTINA COMPLICATED. THAT'S BECAUSE THIS IS VISENTINI VERY COMPLICATED. SO CHARMED AMONG THE. BOTH INDIVIDUALS AND PLANTS AS WE HAVE PLANNED EXITING AND ENTERING EVERY YEAR PUTS AN ONUS ON REGULATORY AND POLICY APPROACHES TO ENSURE ACCURATE AND ACCESSIBLE PROVIDER NETWORKS. IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT WE FACE CHALLENGES FROM THESE THIS TURNOVER IN TURN MATTER WHERE WE GO FOR HERE FROM HERE. AS EMPLOYER BASED COVERAGE BECOMES LESS PREVALENT. MORE INDIVIDUALS ARE GOING TO RELY ON COVERAGE OUTSIDE OF EMPLOYMENT THROUGH THE MARKETPLACES AS THEIR PRIMARY SOURCE OF INSURANCE EITHER THE TRANSITION AREA POLICY IS THEY'RE GOING IN BETWEEN JOBS. OR AS A PERMANENT POLICY MOVE FORWARD. ENSURE WITHDRAWALS MEANS THAT MEET PEOPLE MUST SWITCH PLANTS. SO EVEN IF THEY DIDN'T WANT TO THEY'RE GONNA HAVE TO SEE CHOOSE A NEW PLAN TO HAVE ONE AUDIO ASSIGNED TO THEM THAT MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE THE SAID THEIR SIDE OF PROVIDERS IN THAT WORK. BUT EVEN IF WE GOT TO THE KIND OF. I DEAL A LEASE IN THE COMPETITIVE SENSE OF HAVING A COMPETITIVE MARKET. IT'S GONNA RELY ON PEOPLE SHOPPING AROUND FOR NEW INSURANCE PLAN EVERY YEAR. AND WHAT THAT MEANS IS PEOPLE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO HAVE GOOD INFORMATION ON WHETHER OR NOT THEIR PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN THEIR CARDIOLOGISTS. OR EVEN JUST A. HOSPITAL THAT THEY MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE EVER USED IS IN THAT WORK IN ONE PLAN VERSUS ANOTHER. SO I THINK THE COMMON THREAD RUNNING THROUGH ALL OF THE POLICY SOLUTIONS TO THIS. THE BASIS FOR INFORMED CONSUMER AND PATIENT CHOICES OF INFORMATION. AND AS THE STATE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT UNDER THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT NOT ONLY UNDER PRESIDENT OBAMA BUT ALSO UNDER PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS LARGELY DEFER TO STATES TO DECIDE HOW TO DEFINE THESE THESE NETWORK ADEQUACY. AND NETWORK. REGULATION THIS YEAR. BUT THE TOP THE TOP LINE FOR ME IS THAT ENSURING ACCURATE AND UP TO DATE PROVIDER DIRECTORIES IS KEY TO WHATEVER STRATEGY YOU USE BUT BEFORE. SO THERE'S THREE P. QUESTIONS THAT I WOULD PUT OUT TO YOU. TO KEEP AN EYE ON MOVING FORWARD. FIRST WE'RE WAITING REGULATORY GUIDANCE FROM THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ON THE USE OF SO CALLED SHORT TERM INSURANCE PLANS. SHORT TERM INSURANCE PLANS HAVE EXISTEDALONGSIDE THE ACA EVER SINCE IT WAS ENACTED IN AND AND AND PUT IN PLACE IN TWENTY FOURTEEN. BUT THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION REALLY. CRAMPED DOWN ON THE ABILITY OF INDIVIDUALS TO USE SHORT TERM PLANS WHICH ARE NOT COMPLIANT WITH THE ACA'S REGULATORY GUIDELINES ON ESSENTIAL HEALTH BENEFITS AND THINGS THAT ARE NOT. LEASE UNDER IT PREVIOUSLY WHEN THEY WERE NOT COMPLIANCE IN THE TERMS OF. COMPLYING WITH THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE YOU IF YOU BOUGHT ONE OF THESE SHORT TERM PLANS WHICH GENERALLY UNDER RIGHT THEY HAVE MUCH. SKIP YOUR BENEFIT STRUCTURES ETCETERA YOU BOUGHT ONE OF THESE THINGS YOU HAD TO PAY THE MANDATE PENALTY IT WAS NOT COMPLY PLAN. NOW WITH THE ELIMINATION OF THE MANDATE THE BRAKES HAVE BASICALLY BEEN TAKEN OFF OF THE SHORT TERM PLANS AND WE'RE EXPECTING FURTHER REGULATORY GUIDANCE. ON THAT'S GOING TO ALLOW PEOPLE FOR EXAMPLE TO STRING TOGETHER MANY SHORT TERM PLANS YOU KNOW A THREE MONTH PLAN A SIX MONTH PLAN THERE'S EVEN PLANS. THAT LAST FOR THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY FOUR DAYS. OF SHORT TERM INSURANCE. AND SO THIS IS GOING TO BE SOMETHING I'M WORTH KEEPING AN EYE ON. THE OTHER. ITEM AS I MENTIONED IS MANDATING. OR A QUANTITATIVE PROVIDER NETWORK ADEQUACY STANDARDS WHICH A LARGELY IN THE CONTROL OF STATES AS IT PERTAINS TO HOW THEY APPLY. TO THE ACA PLANS ARE IN THE US AND. EXPANSION OF CONSUMER INFORMATION TOOLS TO MAKE SURE THAT INDIVIDUAL SHOPPING FOR INSURANCE PLANS HAVE ACCESS TO. AN UP TO DATE. PROVIDER NETWORK. ANOTHER OPTION AVAILABLE TO STATES ARE ONLY TWO OF WHICH HAVE TAKEN UP ARE THUS FAR. WOULD BE NEW YORK IN MONTANA IS SO CALLED TWELVE MONTH CONTINUOUS ELIGIBILITY FOR MEDICAL ADULTS MEANING THAT ONCE YOU'RE. DEEMED ELIGIBLE FOR THE MEDICAL PROGRAM. YOU ARE THEN ELIGIBLE FOR THE REMAINING OF FOR A TWELVE MONTH PERIOD AS OPPOSED TO IF YOU HAVE A LIFE OR INCOME CIRCUMSTANCE CHANGE THAT MIGHT MAKE YOU INELIGIBLE AT SOME POINT THE FUTURE. IT REQUIRES THAT AN AMENDMENT TO YOUR STATE PLAN BUT IT IS AN OPTION AVAILABLE. THANK YOU. BOB THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU OP ALL YOU PANEL SOME OF LIKE TO OPEN IT UP FOR QUESTIONS FROM THAT DíAS. MISTREATMENT. I THINK YOU OFFER. UMPIRE HAVE. QUICK QUESTION. THANK HER FOR MISS KAUFMAN BUT THE FIRST ONE THE POSITION SHORTAGE THAT YOU REFERENCED IS THAT PARTICULAR TO CALIFORNIA OR IS THAT NATIONWIDE NOW THERE IS A DIFFERENCE IN CALIFORNIA FROM WHAT WE'RE SEEING OTHER PLACES. OKAY SO IS THERE A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CALIFORNIA AND THE REST OF THE U. S. WELL I THINK THIS. THE AGING OF THE FISHES XIN WORKFORCE IS A NATIONAL PHENOMENON. IS DATA SAID OUR SUPPLY OF PHYSICIANS. ASH ALSO SAY THAT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN URBAN AND RURAL AREAS IS A NATIONAL PHENOMENON WHERE EVER GO ACROSS THE NATION RURAL AREAS. HAVE FEWER POSITIONS IN URBAN AREAS BUT RELATIVE TO OTHER STATES TO TAKE WHERE ANY IN A WORSE POSITION. THEN THEN MANY THAN MANY STATES BUT NOT BY NO MEANS THE WORST AND WHY DO YOU THINK THAT IS. I'M. YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW THAT WE HAVE A GOOD REASON I THINK ONE REASON MAY BE THAT WE. A HAVE LESS. MEDICAL EDUCATION CAPACITY RELATIVE TO THE SIZE OF OUR POPULATION THAT MANY STATES AND IN BOTH THE MEDICAL SCHOOL LEVEL. AND THE RESIDENCY LEVEL THAT IF YOU LOOK AT A PLACE LIKE IN NEW YORK NEW YORK I THINK IS WHAT AT THE OTHER EXTREME YOU MIGHT SAY THEY'RE GOING OVER CAPITALIZE BUT COMPARED TO SAY. A TEXAS OR FLORIDA WHICH HAS HAD MUCH MORE SUBSTANTIAL. GROSS IN MEDICAL EDUCATION OVER THE LAST DECADE WE'RE UNDER CAPITALIZED. PAN AND THE SECOND QUESTION IS I WAS ARE VERY INTERESTED IN YOUR. NURSE PRACTITIONER DR. SLIDE WE WE GET SOME LEGISLATION LAST YEAR TO TRY TO. HELPING CREE SOME ABILITY FOR NURSE PRACTITIONERS TO PRACTICE AND I'M JUST WONDERING IF YOU HAVE ANY COMMENT WHETHER THERE'S ANY EVIDENCE. ABOUT. KIND OF. THE MODEL OF OF AREAS THAT UTILIZE MORE NURSE PRACTITIONERS. FOR WHAT DOCTORS ARE DOING IN OTHER PLACES IN TERMS OF HOW COME. SO I THINK I AM STUDIES THAT HAVE MADE HEAD TO HEAD COMPARISONS OF PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS AND NURSE PRACTITIONERS. AND PHYSICIAN ASSISTANTS WHEN LOOKING WITHIN THEIR SCOPE OF PRACTICE MEAN LOOKING AT THOSE THINGS THAT IN PEACE MPAS IMPRESSED PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS ARE ALL. TRAINED TO DO THAT THERE REALLY AREN'T SIGNIFICANT. DIFFERENCES. IS WALDRON. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. A COUPLE QUICK QUESTIONS. FROM MISTER PEROT. IN YOUR OF PRESENTATION. I JUST OF TWO QUESTIONS LONG WAS REGARDING THE PROVIDER PARTICIPATION. NOT ENOUGH PHYSICIANS ACCEPTING NEW. NEW MEDI CAL PATIENTS. THAT THE REIMBURSEMENT REIMBURSEMENT RATES COULD BE PART OF THAT ANOTHER ISSUE WAS GETTING REFERRALS TO SPECIALTY CARE. IN MEDICO. ACTUATION SO. THE LACK OF BEING ABLE TO GET REFERRALS TO SPECIALTY CARE IS THAT DRIVEN BY THE LACK OF SPECIALTY CARE PROVIDERS OR IS IT DO TO REGIONAL ISSUES YOU KNOW YOU CAN'T. GET TO A SPECIALIST IN A RURAL AREA AND IT'S JUST KIND OF AVERAGE. WHAT WOULD BE? THE MAIN REASON FOR THAT IT'S. IT'S IT'S ALL THE ABOVE SO THAT THAT. FIRST QUESTION CHILDREN THAT CHART ON THE LEFT WAS ASKED OF ALL PHYSICIANS SO ALL THE ALL THE ANSWERS THERE. WERE ANSWERS THAT WERE GIVEN BY BOTH PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS AND SPECIALISTS. SO IT'S IT'S MANY OF THE SAME REASONS SO IT'S IT'S IT'S SPECIALISTS ARE NOT PARTICIPATING IN MEDICARE PROGRAM FOR. BECAUSE OF RATES BECAUSE OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN BECAUSE OF THE OF THE RANGE OF ISSUES AND THEN CERTAINLY THE GEOGRAPHIC. THE AGGRIEVED GEOGRAPHIC ISSUE IS THAT IS AN IMPORTANT ONE. WHAT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE FIND IN OUR WORK IN? IN TELEHEALTH IS THAT. WHAT ONE OF THAT ONE OF THE ONE OF THE CHALLENGES THAT PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS UNDERSTANDABLY THEY PREFERRED TO REFER TO THIS AND THEY KNOW THEY KNOW WELL? AND IF THEY'RE GOING TO REFER OUT FOR A CONSOLE THEY PREFER IT THAT. STATE SPECIALIST ALSO THEN BE AVAILABLE FOR AN APPOINTMENT. THAT'S OFTEN NOT NOT. POSSIBLE CRITICALLY IN RURAL AREAS. AND SO THERE IS WE FIND. SOME. COURTING TIME. WHEN ONE INTRODUCES AYE TELEHEALTH INTO A PRIMARY CARE PRACTICE OF PHYSICIANS GETTING TO KNOW ONE ANOTHER IT'S PERHAPS ONE REASON THAT. THAT DAY. E. CONSUL DID YOU REFERRAL SYSTEMS HAVE WORKED SO WELL IN SOME OF THE PUBLIC HOSPITAL SYSTEMS IS BECAUSE THERE IS A GREATER FAMILIARITY OF THE PHYSICIANS AMONG EACH OTHER BUT. SO THERE'S THOSE THERE'S AS RANGE OF REASONS. OKAY AND THEN THE SECOND QUESTION WAS OF YOU HAVE SOME CHARTS ON PAGE THIRTEEN OF YOUR. UP PRESENT IT WOULD JUST SHOW THE QUALITY OF CARE AND MEDI CAL. MANAGED CARE SIMILAR TO THE NATIONAL MEDICAID AVERAGES. BUT WE'RE NOT IMPROVING WHICH IS KIND OF THEIR. ARE THERE ANY STATES THAT ARE DOING BETTER ARE WHEN YOU LOOK OVERALL ANOTHER. THIS TYPE OF THE UNABOMBER LOOKING AT THEY THINK HE THIS CHART OTHER ANY OTHER DOING BETTER IS NEW YORK DOING BETTER SAY THAN. THEN WE ARE IS IN A SENIOR YEAH LIKE THAT IT'S HARD TO COMPARE. FOR ALL THE SAME REASONS THAT IT'S HARD TO COMPARE MEDI CAL TO OTHER FORMS OF COVERAGE HERE IN CALIFORNIA BECAUSE OF THE. DIFFERENCES IN THE POPULATIONS THE SAME IS TRUE WHEN COMPARING MANAGED CARE PROGRAMS ACROSS STATES FOR EXAMPLE SEVERAL YEARS AGO WE EXPANDED THE MEDICAID MANAGED CARE PROGRAM TO SENIORS AND PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES. AND SO THEY'RE THEY'RE INCLUDED IN OUR RATES. AND YOU MIGHT LOOK AT ANOTHER STATE WHERE THE DOZEN EXPAND ITS MANAGED CARE PROGRAM. TO THAT POPULATION AND AND THEY WOULDN'T BE INCLUDED THE RIGHT SO IT'S IT'S AGAIN OFTEN APPLES. TO ORANGES. COMPARISON. YOU KNOW THAT I WAS STANDING WE DO SOME SEE SOME STATES. YOU KNOW THE ONE THAT STICKS OUT IN MY MIND IS MASSACHUSETTS. OUT IS. WRITTEN ONE. WHO HAS A NUMBER OF UP PLANS THAT OFTEN WILL WIN AWARDS AND EVEN IN THE MEDICAID SPHERE? SO THERE ARE SOME STATES THAT SEEM TO BE DOING BETTER. YEAH CASTLES BENCHMARKS. THE WELL CHILD VISITS. BREAST CANCER SCREENING THINGS LIKE THAT. THERE. THE DOING BETTER THE WE ARE OKAY I'M. THEN REALLY QUICK. DOCTOR COUGHED MOVED. FOR YEAH YOUR YOUR CHART WHO'S SHOWING THE. RATIO OF ACTIVE PATIENT CARE PHYSICIANS PER ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND. BY REGION. PART OF MY DISTRICT IS THE INLAND EMPIRE MOVEMENT I NOTICE THIRTY FIVE. PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS AND I KNOW WHEN I MEET WITH MY PHYSICIANS AND THE RIVERSIDE MEDICAL ASSOCIATION. THEIR BIGGEST ISSUE IS REIMBURSEMENT RATES BUT THEY ARE SO MUCH LOWER THAN OTHER AREAS EVEN AROUND THE STATE. THAT THEY'RE HAVING TO DEAL WITH. YOU NOBLE WHEN YOU SEE LIKE THIS IT'S REALLY HIGHLIGHTED. AND I THINK INTO ONE OF THE THINGS WE REALLY HAVE TO DO IS GET. HILL LOOKING AT THAT ISSUE IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE BESIDE RATES THAT COULD BE. IMPACTING THEM BECAUSE YOU KNOW EVEN WITH DANTICAT ALL THAT PART OF MY DISTRICT. PEOPLE CANNOT ACCESS IT AND TO CALL. DENTIST WITHIN FIFTY MILES OF. WHERE THEY LIVE SOUND SO RIGHT YOU KNOW IT IS A RIGHT I THINK RATES ARE ARE PART OF IT AYE I THINK? IT WILL BE INTERESTING IN YOUR REGION AT LEAST ON THE MAT ARE AMONG PHYSICIANS TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS AS. I AM YOU KNOW YOUR NEW MEDICAL SCHOOL AT UC RIVERSIDE. BEGINS TO GRADUATE IN IS THOSE FOLKS FINISH THEIR RESIDENCY. WILL THEY PRACTICE IN THOSE AREAS OF RIVERSIDE THAT ARE OF GREATEST. I NEED. SO I THINK THEY THINK THAT'S BEEN ONE AGENT YOU HAVEN'T HAD AS MUCH COMPARED TO SAY LOS ANGELES OR SAN DIEGO OR EVEN AREN'T. YOU HAVEN'T HAD AS MUCH AND MANY PHYSICIANS IN TRAINING. IN IN THE LOCAL AREA AND AND SO I THINK THAT'S ONE THING THAT PAYMENT IS CERTAINLY CERTAINLY IN TERMS OF FOLKS WILLINGNESS. I'VE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE MEDICARE PROGRAM IS AS MR PEROT SHOWED. THAT THE A BIG PART IN INSECT ALSO IN IN TERMS OF NOT JUST PAYMENT. BUT THE ADMINISTRATIVE REQUIREMENTS AND COMPLEXITIES TO PARTICIPATE IN THE MEDI CAL PROGRAM THAT NOT ONLY ARE YOU BEING PAID LESS BUT. YOU'RE STRUGGLING MORE TO GET PAID AT ALL. AND YOU KNOW THAT UNDERSTANDABLY FOR INDEPENDENT. PRACTICES WHETHER THEIR PHYSICIANS R. DENNIS TENDS TO MAKE FOLKS FRUSTRATED UNHAPPY AND SOMETIMES SAY. NO I'M NOT WILLING TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAM IT'S TOO MUCH HASSLE. AND JUST REAL QUICK THE SECOND UNDER. WHICHI THOUGHT WAS EXCELLENT STRATEGIES FOR EXPANDING THE PRIMARY CARE CAPACITY OF MORE THAN ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS IS EXPANDING TRAINING IN MEDICAL SCHOOL AND RESIDENCY. YOU KNOW WHAT WE'VE SEEN AND I HAVE WRITTEN NUMEROUS CLINICS IN MY DISTRICT BECAUSE I ACTUALLY HAVE SOME OF THE LOWEST INCOME. RIGHT CENSUS TRACKS IN THE NATION IN MY MY DISTRICT. THE LACK OF ABILITY TO GET REFERRALS IS THE KEY THAT'S WHY IT'S KIND SPARKED MY INTEREST. BUT WHEN YOU'RE IN A CLINIC YOU KNOW HOW HOW DO WE DO WITH THE CHRONIC CARE ISSUES. IF WE ARE YOU WORKING IN ONE WITHOUT SOME SPECIAL SO SO SOME SPECIALISTS. EXPANDING THE TRAINING TO GET SOME KNOWLEDGE OF CHRONIC CARE. ALLERGY. YOU KNOW I'M TREATMENTS. THE OPIOID CERTIFICATIONS ARE SO NEEDED. EVEN EIGHT AIDS HIV WHEN YOU HAVE A PATIENT COME IN EVEN BEING ABLE TO COUNSEL THEM AND IN A PRIMARY CARE SIX SO CRITICAL. YES NOW I THINK IT'S ACRE OF SORTS A FEW THINGS THERE. MR PRONE. TOUCHED UPON THE POTENTIAL OF TELEHEALTH E. CONSOLES AND YOU DON'T CERVANTES HER MEANS HERE FRANCISCO IN LOS ANGELES THAT YOU CONSULTAR PROVIDED A WAY FOR THE PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS TO INTERACT WITH SPECIALIST POSITIONS WHO ARE OFF. SITE AND GET THAT COACHING THERE'S ALSO A MODEL WE HAVE IN CALIFORNIA STARTED IN NEW MEXICO BUT BUT EXPORTED AROUND THE NATION AND THE WORLD WHICH IS CALL PROJECT ECHO WHICH IS A MODEL FOR THE SHERATON LEARNING. PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS AND SPECIALISTS THAT REALLY. WORKS ON UPSCALING PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS TO ENHANCE THEIR CAPACITY TO MANAGE PEOPLE WITH PARTICULAR ILLNESSES STARTED WITH HEPATITE HABSI IN IS GOING TO HIV MANY OTHER. OUGHT CONDITION SO THOSE ARE GOOD MODELS THAT THE SECOND THING I WOULD POINT OUT AND A LOT OF OUR CLINICS I THINK ARE QUITE SAVVY ABOUT THIS IS WHEN IT COMES TO MANAGING CHRONIC ILLNESS. THE REFERRALS AND AVAILABLE TO SPECIALISTS ARE NOT THE ONLY THING THAT MATTERS PARTICULARLY FOR OUR CHRONIC ILLNESSES FOR WHICH. R.. BEHAVIOR R. ABILITY TO MANAGE MEDICATION REGIMEN MANAGE OUR DIET. THOSE ARE SENSITIVE PHYSICAL ACTIVITY. THAT FOR GETTING FOLKS TO MANAGE THOSE PARTS OF THE ILLNESS. PEOPLE LIKE HEALTH COACH ISN'T COMMITTEE HEALTH WORKERS THAT THESE FOLKS PARTICULARLY. IF THEY'RE FROM THE SAME COMMUNITY THE SAME. SPEAK THE SAME LANGUAGE SAME RACIAL ETHNIC GROUP THAT OFTEN THOSE FOLKS. GET MOR TRACTION THAN EITHER A PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN OR SPECIALIST IN HELPING PEOPLE DO THE THINGS THEY NEED TO DO TO MANAGE THEIR OWN ILLNESS AND AS A WATER CLINICS ARE. ARE ARE SAVVY ABOUT THIS OUR MEDICAID PROGRAM COULD BE SAVVIER IN REIMBURSING. FOR THOSE SERVICES SO THAT ALL OF OUR. CLINT FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTERS WILL HAVE MAKES CAN HAVE THE ABILITY TO HIRE PERMANENTLY THE KIND OF STAFF WHO CAN WORK WITH THEIR PATIENTS ON CHRONIC ILLNESS MANAGEMENT. SURGICAL. PROFESSOR COFFIN I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR FOR YOUR PRESENTATION AYE AYE. THIS IS A TOPIC I THINK THOSE OF US WHO'VE BEEN FOCUSED ON HEALTH CARE HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE BUT THINKING ABOUT BUT OFTEN HAS GOTTEN LOST IN THE LARGER DEBATE AROUND. WHAT TO DO WITH THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM AND? AYE I HAVE A JUST A COMMENT AND THEN A. A QUESTION THAT THE COMMENT IS. AYE I THINK AND I MY GUESS IS OUR COLLEAGUES WILL AGREE THAT WHATEVER WE END UP DOING IF THERE'S A PACKAGE OF BILLS AND MOVE FORWARD IN THIS AREA. WE REALLY SHOULD THINK HARD ABOUT INCLUDING SOME ELEMENTS OF OF HOW WE ADDRESS SHORTAGES PROVIDER SHORTAGES. IT IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE STATE. HOW WE THINK ABOUT THE FUTURE OF OF OF EDUCATION HOW WE THINK ABOUT? R. SHORTAGES WHEN IT COMES TO NURSE PRACTITIONERS AND. PHYSICIAN ASSISTANTS ECCENTRICITIES PROBABLY AN OBVIOUS POINT BUT ONE THAT I THINK OFTEN GETS LOST IN A. ONE I THINK THE CHAIRS FOR OF REALLY INCLUDING YOU AS PART OF THIS THIS PANEL. NAM WHEN I WAS GOING THROUGH YOUR PRESENTATION YOU USE LANGUAGE LIKE NEED TO KNOW WHAT ARE THE STRATEGIES WE NEED TO EMPLOY AND AND THERE'S. THEIR PROJECT. BROAD PHRASES WE NEED TO AUGMENT STRATEGIES TO INCENTIVIZE NEW GRADUATES RETAIN PHYSICIANS THINK ABOUT HOW TO GET MORE PRIMARY CARE DOCTORS STRATEGIC PLANS THAT ENGAGE MULTIPLE STAKEHOLDERS. IS THERE. ARE IS OUR COMPREHENSIVE PLAN THAT EXISTS OUT THERE MEAN COULD YOU. ARE OR ARE THERE OTHERS WHO WOULD BE ABLE TO SAY WHAT WOULD WE NEED TO DO TO CHANGE THE BALANCE. PRIMARY CARE DOCTORS FIRST SPECIALIST TO GET THE THAT THAT THE NUMBERS THAT WE NEED IN THE RIGHT PLACES. I'D LOVE TO KNOW IF IF THERE'S CONSENSUS ON ON WHAT THAT WOULD TAKE HOW MANY MORE MEDICAL SCHOOLS WHERE WOULD THEY BE WATER BELONGED FORGIVENESS PROGRAMS THESE ARE ALL DETAILS THAT WE KNOW WE HAVE TO WORK OUT BUT MY GUESS IS. LIKE YOU. AND OTHERS HAVE PROBABLY THOUGHT HARD ABOUT THIS ALREADY SO THAT'S AN EXCELLENT QUESTION I THINK AS MR CRONIN I MENTIONED. PERHAPS YOU OUT OF THE ROOM AT THAT TIME. THE CALIFORNIA FUTURE HEALTH WORKFORCE OF COMMISSION WAS LAUNCHED THIS PASSPORT FALL. ASSEMBLYMEMBER WOOD IS A MEMBER AS IS SENATOR ED HERNANDEZ. THE OTHER MEMBERS INCLUDE REPRESENTATIVES OF HEALTH PLANS EMPLOYERS EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS. A UNIONS. OTHER ORGANIZATIONS AS INTENTIONALLY A GROUP OF MULTIPLE STAKEHOLDERS. WHO'S CHARGED IS TO PRODUCE A STRATEGIC PLAN FOR HEALTH WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT IN CALIFORNIA. THE TARGET. TIME FOR RELEASE OF THAT IS FALL OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE COMMISSION'S HELD TWO MEETINGS THUS FAR NEXT MEETING IN FEBRUARY. ARE IN THE COMMISSION THAT HAS. STIRS SUBCOMMITTEES WORKING ON ISSUES INCLUDING PRIMARY CARE. MENTAL HEALTH AND CARE FOR THE AGING POPULATION SO I I THINK THAT'S THE GROUP ARE THAT'S TAKING THAT ON AND WITH ASSEMBLYMEMBER WOULD YOU HAVE A KIND TO IT. BY TO THAT GROUP. THERE CERTAINLY MANY OTHER ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE ENGAGED BUT THAT'S REALLY THE I WOULD SAY THAT THE VEHICLE FOR A COMPREHENSIVE PLAN AT THIS MOMENT GRID NO PRESSURE DOCTOR WOULD BUT. HOW NNOVA CAN FOR TO THAT THING THAT MUCH SO? MISS COLLETTE. I APPRECIATED YOUR COMMENT ABOUT THE. DELICATE GRAND. BARGAIN. VERY VERY INTERESTING VERY INTERESTING STATEMENT THERE. I'M CURIOUS. IN YOU KNOW. REPRESENTING A DISTRICT WHERE HAVE FIVE COUNTIES. AND A VERY RURAL DISTRICT AND THE CHALLENGES WE HAVE AROUND. PLANNED AVAILABILITY AND COST. IN OTHER STATES I MEAN YOU MENTION JUST ACT AS THE STATE WAS A COUNTY HAVE LIKE THREE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FOUR PEOPLE IS THAT RIGHT. NET AND SO HOW THAT'S A PRETTY PRETTY THIN RISK POOL. ONE PERSON GETS A HANG NAIL THAT MIGHT BE A PROBLEM. BUT BUT HOW IT IN OTHER STATES HAVE HAD THEY LOOKED AT DIFFERENT WAYS OF COOLING DE HAD HAS STATES MANY DIFFERENT WAYS OF POOLING THAT BECAUSE. YOU KNOW IT IS IT IS AN ISSUE PRETTY CALIFORNIA. WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY YOU LEAVE SACRAMENTO YOU GO NORTH IT'S RURAL OKAY AND SO YET YET WE HAVE MUCH LOWER PREMIUMS IN IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA HAVE THERE BEEN MODE MOVEMENTS IN OTHER STATES A SALE OKAY. PLANS. THIS IS THE WAY IT'S GOING TO BE AND WE'RE GONNA PULL ALL RURAL PEOPLE AND MAKE THEM INTO ONE POOL OR AT THAT HAVE THERE BEEN OTHER STRATEGIES BECAUSE IT IS IT IS EXTREMELY FRUSTRATING. THAT. YOU KNOW I'M THE PEOPLE OF MY COMMUNITIES ARE NO LESS HEALTHY THAN THE PEOPLE IN OTHER PARTS OF LOS ANGELES YET WE'RE PAYING HIGHER PREMIUMS AND THAT'S IN THERE'S A FUNDAMENTAL. UNFAIRNESS THERE SO HELP ME WITH HELP ME WITH YEAH SURE SO WHEN WE LOOK AT SOME OF THE ACTIONS OF OTHER STATES I'M CERTAINLY YOU MAY ALREADY HEARD ABOUT THIS AND NUMBER STATES HAVE LOOKED AT REINSURANCE ON WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY INSURANCE FOR THE INSURANCE COMPANIES BUT WHAT IT DOES. IS IT IT. AID ESSENTIALLY. FOR SAY FOR EXAMPLE FOR US SMALL. RISK POOL. WHERE YOU HAVE A HIGH COST PERSON WITH HEMOPHILIA OR? HIV AIDS ARE YOU THOSE WRITTEN MILLION PLUS DOLLAR CONDITIONS. IT ESSENTIALLY. PROVIDES A QUESTION. TO PROTECT THOSE IN CHARGE FROM THAT REALLY EXTRAORDINARILY HIGH COST. GROUP OF PATIENTS SO FOR EXAMPLE ALASKA AYE IMPLEMENTED A REINSURANCE PROGRAM IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN. THEY WENT FROM PREMIUM INCREASES OF ABOUT FORTY NINE PERCENT TO NINE PERCENT SO THEY REALLY BROUGHT THOSE PREMIUM INCREASES DOWN. VERY SUBSTANTIALLY BY IMPLEMENTING A REINSURANCE PROGRAM. A STATE LIKE WASHINGTON AS I'M ALSO LOOKING AT REINSURANCE BUT THEY ALSO ARE LOOKING OUT THOSE RATING REGION'S RIGHT. AND YOU KNOW RIGHT NOW THE EVERY STATE IN CALIFORNIA AS YOU KNOW HAS NINETEEN RATING REGIONS BUT DIFFERENT STATES APPROACH THEIR RATING REGIONS IN DIFFERENT WAYS AND SO WASHINGTON AND. IS IS LOOKING AT COULD THEY WERE REDESIGNED THOSE RATING REGION'S THOSE GEOGRAPHIC RATING REGIONS TO MAKE IT. TO MORE ADEQUATELY ALLOW. CARRIERS TO PRICE FOR THE REST THAT THEY FACED IN THOSE REGIONS SO WASHINGTON MIGHT BE ANOTHER STATE TO LOOK AT. IN AS YOU'RE TALKING THAT WE'RE TO TALK TO LIVE ABOUT THE PUBLIC OPTION IF YOU'RE IF CALIFORNIA WOULD LOOK AT A PUBLIC AUCTION OPTION WHAT WOULD YOU FOR MEDI CAL. AND WHAT WOULD YOU HOW WOULD YOU SUGGEST WE CRAFT THAT. TOILETS WITH EVERYTHING HEALTHCARE POLICY OF COURSE THE DEVIL'S IN THE DETAILS ON THE MEAN ONE APPROACH AND AND THAT'S INTERESTING OF COURSE BECAUSE I'M I WAS POINT OUT WHEN. I'M TALKING TO REPUBLICANS. IN WASHINGTON DC IS THAT IN FACT THE REPUBLICAN LED CONGRESS WHEN THEY CREATED THE MEDICARE PART D. PROGRAM CREATED A PUBLIC OPTION FALL BACK. IN THAT PROGRAM AND THE IDEA WAS IF THEY COULDN'T GET A PRIVATE CARRIER TO PARTICIPATE THERE WOULD BE THIS. PUBLIC OPTION AND THAT WOULD COME IN AND PRIDE AND IT TURNED OUT MEDICARE PART D. DIDN'T NEED IT THEY HAD ENOUGH PRIVATE INSURERS BUT THE POINT IS THAT THERE WAS. THIS WAS A REPUBLICAN IDEA. BUT. CERTAINLY IN A IN A STATE COULD. SET UP A FALLBACK OPTIONS SO THAT IF THEY COULDN'T GET A PRIVATE INSURER TO CON MEN THERE MIGHT BE AN ENTITY THAT WOULD CONTRACT WITH THE STATE. I'M NOW THERE ARE COMPLICATED ISSUES ABOUT HOW YOU SET UP PRABHAT. AT WORK HOW DO YOU REIMBURSE PROVIDERS HOW DO YOU DO CLAIMS ADMINISTRATION WHO BEARS THE RISK SO THOSE ARE ALL KINDS OF QUESTIONS YOU WANT TO GET INTO BUT THAT MIGHT BE ONE OPTION ON YOU MAINTAIN THE CURRENT STRUCTURE BUT YOU SAID LOOKING FOR DOWN TO ONE CARRIER? OR THERE'S A RISK OF NO CARRIER WE'RE GONNA HAVE A THE STATE STEP IN AND PROVIDE THAT COVERAGE. OF MIST MISTER PRONE. BUT KIND OF FOLLOW UP ON MISS WALDRON'S QUESTION WE TALKED ABOUT. ONE OF THE CHALLENGES THAT PHYSICIANS IN A PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS HAVE WHY NOT PARTICIPATE IN THE MEDICARE PROGRAM IS THE. IS THE LACK OF OF AVAILABILITY OF SPECIALISTS SO AS A PARTICIPATION PRIMARY CARE. PARTICIPATION VERSES SPECIALTY PRODUCE PARTICIPATION WHAT THE PERCENTAGE OF PRIMARY CARE POSITIONS THAT PARTICIPATE IN MEDI CAL VERSUS THE PERCENTAGE OF. SPECIALTY PHYSICIANS WHO PARTICIPATE DO YOU HAVE THAT NUMBER YOU'VE GIVEN US UNCLOG A GROUP NUMBER BUT. BUT MY INSTINCT IS THAT A WHOLE LOT MORE PRIMARY CARE FOR PROVIDERS PROVIDE YOU PARTICIPATE AND A WHOLE LOT LESS SPECIALISTS IS THAT A FAIR CHARACTERIZATION DO YOU HAVE THAT NUMBER. THE END IF I MISS IT I'M SORRY. I'D. WHICH I WILL. NEED TO PULL OUT. THAT DID THAT IT DOES SHOW THAT WOULD THE RATIOS OF. OF. F. F. T. EASE A BOTH. OF PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS AND SPECIALISTS. TO THE POPULATION WHICH IS. THINK EARLY IN THIS. AND YOU CAN SEE THAT THERE ARE. THERE ARE MORE. AS USE HIS OFFICE TO FIND THE TWO GROUPS THERE ARE MORE SPECIALIST PARTICIPATING. AS A RATIO THAT YOU KNOW THAT AS A RATIO TODAY AND WILL POPULATION SO THAT'S I'M. ON. SHOULD BE SLIGHT ELEVEN. OKAY SKINNY SIDE FIVE. OKAY GREAT THANK. GO AHEAD PLEASE. OKAY CAN MEET. UP TO D SO I THINK IT'S A GREAT QUESTION BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT WHEN WE HAVE THOSE TO BE CLUMPS OF PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS AND SPECIALS WE MASK A LOT OF VARIATION. WITHIN SECTION THE SPECIAL THAT WE LOOK UP MORE NARROWLY EMERGENCY MEDICINE PHYSICIANS NO SURPRISE ARE THE MOST LIKELY TO PARTICIPATE IN THE MEDICARE PROGRAM BECAUSE QUITE FRANKLY THEY DON'T HAVE AS MUCH CHOICE IN TALLEST AS IF A PATIENT PRESENTS A JUROR ET ISSUE IN WELL NO. MEMBER OF NAMBLA YOU'VE GOT IT ASSESS IT WE STABILIZE IN YOU DON'T ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT INSURANCE. AT THE OTHER END OF THE SPECTRUM WE HAVE PSYCHIATRY LOWEST RATE OF PARTICIPATION IN THE MEDICAL PROGRAM A SPECIALITY WHERE. SOME FOLKS IN THE SPECIALLY JUST DON'T KNOW PROTECT ANY FORM OF INSURANCE YOU KNOW NOT NOT NOT YOU KNOW DOESN'T MATTER COULD BE THE BLUE PLATED. ANTHEM PLAN THEY STILL WON'T TAKE IT. SO. THAT SEPARATION AND THEN AMONG PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS PEDIATRICIANS MUCH MORE LIKELY BY THE AND THE GENERAL INTERNISTS IN THE FAMILY PHYSICIANS. YEAH PLEASE THING THAT. AGAIN THE SAME THINK YOU THE SAME SURVEY THAT THAT JASMINE APART OUT IS. THERE'S. THERE'S CAN SEVERAL VARIATION IN TERMS OF WHERE PEOPLE PRACTICE IN THEIR PARTICIPATION SO IF YOU PRACTICE IN A. VERY CLEVER HEALTH CENTER YOU'RE MUCH MORE LIKELY FOR SPAIN MEDICAL PROGRAM SHIHAD THEN NOT AND. IN CHI A KAISER DOCKS MORE SO PRIVATE PRACTICE STOCKS MUCH LESS SO. AND. TO ENFORCE ON THANK YOU IT'S ACTUALLY IT'S A PLEASURE WORKING WITH YOU. A PROFESSOR COUGHLIN ON THE ON THE ON THE ON THE TASK FORCE WHO WERE WORKING ON. THE A ONE THAT YOU TALKED ABOUT THE AGE DISCREPANCY BETWEEN POSITIONS IN DIFFERENT TOWNS IN ONE OF MY COUNTIES A FIFTY PERCENT OF PHYSICIANS ARE OVER THE AGE OF SIXTY TWO. AND. THAT. THAT THAT MAY BE A HIGH NUMBER FOR OTHER OTHER AREAS BUT THAT THAT NUMBER OF OF. HIGHER AGE PHYSICIANS IN RURAL COMMUNITIES REALLY IS IS A IS A IS A IS A REAL REALITY. AS WE TRANSITION TO SINGLE PAYER ON WE KNOW IN OTHER COUNTRIES THAT. THAT THIRTY PERCENT OF THE FOR OF POSITIONS TO YOUR ROUGHLY I MEAN AS A NUMBERS WE HEARD FROM COMMONWEALTH FOLKS. OF THAT AT THIRTY PERCENT. R. ARE PRINT ARE. OUR EYES SPECIALIST AND SEVENTY PERCENT PRIMARY CARE. VERSUS WHAT WE HAVE NOW WHICH IS JUST THE OPPOSITE SEVENTY PERCENT OF OUR PHYSICIANS ARE A ROUGHLY ARE SPECIALISTS IN AND THIRTY PERCENT OR PRIMARY CARE. ANY IDEA HOW LONG IT WOULD TAKE US TO TRANSITION TO TO TO DO THAT BECAUSE YOU'VE YOU'VE POINTED OUT VERY QUICKLY THAT WE IN CáC COMPANY DON'T REALLY EVEN HAVE THE CAPACITY EDUCATE. THE NUMBER OF DOCTORS WE NEED TO MAINTAIN OUR OWN POPULATION SO. THE HOW YOU KNOW HOW WE GET THERE. AYE I DON'T KNOW THAT I'D I'D WANT TO HAZARD A GUESS BUT LIKELY UP SOMETHING ELSE THAT'S DIFFERENT BETWEEN THE U. S. E. AND MANY OTHER. DEVELOPED COUNTRIES IN AND AND THAT IS WE LARGELY EXPECT OUR PHYSICIANS TO SELF FINANCE. THEIR EDUCATION CORRECT I'D THEY ASSUME A LOT OF THOUGHT A JET YOU KNOW THE AVERAGE E. I THINK AT THIS POINT IS ABOUT HUNDRED NINETIES THAT HUNDRED NINETY THOUSAND. IT IN MANY OTHER COUNTRIES ARE THE COST OF MEDICAL EDUCATION IS HIGHLY SUBSIDIZED FROM YOU KNOW TUITION IS MUCH. UP LOW WERE FOR IT FOR MEDICAL SCHOOL I'M SURE AGAIN THAT MAY WELL BE ONE REASON WHY THOSE COUNTRIES. SUCCEED MORE INTRIGUED MORE PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS. STUDIES THAT LOOK AT SPECIALTY CHOICE AMONG U. S. PHYSICIANS SAY THAT DEBT AND FINANCE IS ONE OF THE BEST SELLING UP THE ONLY ONE BUT IT'S IT'S ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT ONES. SICKENING OTHER COUNTRIES DON'T HAVE QUITE AS BIG OF A GAP OFTEN IN. SALARIES AND REIMBURSEMENT FOR PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS AN OUNCE BEYOND SPECIALISTS SO THAT'S ANOTHER PIECE OF IT ARE IN AND SECONDLY I THINK AND YOU KNOW I SAY THIS IS. YOU KNOW AS SOMEONE WHO'S BEEN IN THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA THAT I THINK WE. WE OFTEN IN THE WAY OUR PHYSICIANS OUR EDUCATED WE EDUCATE IN A WAY. THAT IT SENDS A MESSAGE TO OUR MEDICAL STUDENTS THAT SPECIALTY CARE IS WHERE IT'S AT YOU DON'T WANT TO BE A PRIMARY COOPER AND SO THERE'S THAT CULTURE CHANGE I THINK ACTUALLY THAT'S THE HARDEST THAT'S EVEN HARDER. THAN X. THEN EXPANDING. CAPACITY SUBSIDIZING EDUCATION. AND AND CHANGING REVERSED WHICH ARE HEAVY LIFTS THE CALLED THE UP BUT THE HARDEST THING SOMETIME IS TO CHANGE. INSTITUTIONS. AND THE FINAL QUESTION I HAVE FOR A PROFESSOR GRAVES. THANK YOU. SEE YOU KNOW WHAT IS YOUR LOOKING AT SOME OF THE CHALLENGES WE'RE LOOKING AT THE. I USE THE WORD BYZANTINE. NETWORK OF OF OF PEOPLE HOW THEY GET CARE BASED ON THEIR ON PLANS AND AND AND NETWORKS. DO YOU THINK IT BE HELPFUL TO REQUIRE HEALTH PLANS TO HAVE THE SAME NETWORK. OF PROVIDERS FOR ALL THE PLANTS. WELL. I WOULD START WITH THE PRINCIPLE I WOULD START WITH IS JUST INFORMATION AND ACCURACY. AND THAT THE FIRST STEP IS TO ENSURE THAT WHATEVER NETWORK THEY HAVE. THE THE PEOPLE ARE CHOOSING A PLAN. BASED ON GOOD IN CURRENT UP TO DATE INFORMATION. SO THAT WOULD BE THE FIRST IF IF I WOULD GO DOWN THE ROAD. OF NETWORK REGULATION THAT WOULD BE THE FIRST STEP THAT I WOULD HAVE IN THAT PROCESS. THERE IS. SOME BENEFIT TO HAVING STANDARDIZE NETWORKS ON THE OTHER HAND IT HAS BEEN PROVEN. ARE AT IT IS SHOWN THAT INDIVIDUALS WHEN SURVEYED ARE WILLING TO SELECT A PLAN THERE WILLING TO MAKE THE TRADE OFF BETWEEN AN AIR OR NETWORK IN A LOWER PREMIUM. AND SO. YOU REALLY HAVE TO KEEP THOSE ISSUES IN MIND. WIN. WHEN THINKING ABOUT STE EITHER STANDARDIZING NETWORK SOBRE ARE ARE MANDATING CERTAIN NETWORK SIZES. YOU CAN THINK OF. IN THIS XIN LIKE KAISER. FOR EXAMPLE A REQUIRING THEM TO TAKE ON MORE PROVIDERS THAN THEY. NECESSARILY WOULD OTHERWISE. WOULD REQUIRE CONTRACTING WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT FAMILIAR WITH THEIR INFORMATION SYSTEMS. WITH THEIR CARE GUIDELINES ETCETERA SO THEY ARE CHALLENGES TO. THAT THAT SPEAK TO ISSUES OF QUALITY. AND COSTS. THEIR TRADE OFFS. THAT WOULD BE ASSOCIATED WITH IT WITH ANY KIND OF. PARTICULARLY STRONG MOVE TOWARDS. KIND OF MANDATED NETWORK. BUT IT IT'S IT'S BEDEVIL THIS FOR YEARS IN CALIFORNIA TO TRY TO GET UP TO DATE PROVIDER NETWORKS IS OFTEN THE CASE THE PHYSICIAN DOESN'T EVEN KNOW WHAT PLAN THEY BELONG TO A. FRIEND THAT'S THAT IS A PROBLEM FOR FOR FOR CONSUMERS FOR PATIENTS. WHO ARE YOU MAY THINK THAT THEY'RE THEY RECOVERED AND IT WAS A BIG? BIG CHALLENGE WE WERE LOOKING AT THE ON HOW TO GET RID OF THE SURPRISE BILLING ISSUE IN CALIFORNIA BECAUSE. IT'S SO CONFUSING OUT THERE AND IN THIS DAY AND AGE WITH ALL THE TECHNOLOGY WE HAVE. TO NOT BE ABLE TO HAVE ACCURATE PROVIDER NETWORKS IS IS IS REALLY CONFOUNDING QUITE FRAIL AYE I LIKE IN IS THAT IF YOU ASK SOMEBODY TO GET FROM. HERE TO ANY POINT IN CALIFORNIA IT'S AKIN TO. GIVING THEM A MAP FROM NINETEEN FIFTY. AS OPPOSED TO LETTING THEM USE GOOGLE MAPS YOU KNOW IF THEY'RE GONNA GET THERE EVENTUALLY BUT THEY'RE GONNA GET LOST ALONG THE WAY THE BUT IT'S MAY HAVE CHANGED SO EXACTLY THAT'S THE POINT. IF YOU REMAIN. FIRST I'D I JUST WANT TO APPRECIATE THE. DANCE AND. TEASE THAT YOU BRING TO THE TABLE HERE TODAY. NICE TO ACTUALLY GET BACK TO WORK AND REALLY FOCUS ON. ISSUES THAT FACE EVERY DAY CALIFORNIANS. I WANTED TO START MY QUESTIONS BY. WITH YOU SABRINA CORRELATE IF I COULD PLEASE AND I'M GONNA GO DOWN IN ORDER THAT YOU PRESENTED. YOU HAD MENTIONED THAT. NETWORKS WHERE THE MAIN DRIVER FOR INCREASES IN PRICE ARE OTHER STATES DOING AND MANAGING THAT WORKS DIFFERENTLY THAN WE DO. WHAT COULD WE LEARN FROM THEIR? SURE WELL. I CAN'T REMEMBER NOW WHETHER IT WAS A CRISIS OR JOHN WHO TALKED ABOUT HOW THIS ISSUE OF NETWORK. REGULATION IS REALLY A STATE LEVEL ISSUE FOR THE MOST PART AND I WOULD SAY THAT. THE VAST MAJORITY OF STATES ARE DO NOT HEAVILY REGULATE NETWORKS AT LEAST IN THE INDIVIDUAL MARKET OR THE MARKETPLACE SAYS. AND IN FACT IN THIS PAST YEAR WHERE WE SAW A LOT OF AREAS OF THE COUNTRY THAT WERE AT RISK OF LOSING THEIR INSURERS. ON MANY STATES RELAXED THEIR NETWORK ADEQUACY STANDARDS SO FOR EXAMPLE IN SOME OF THE COUNTIES IN OHIO THAT WERE AT RISK THERE WERE REAL CHALLENGES THAT THE CARRIERS FACED IN CONTRACTING WITH. OUR HOSPITAL SYSTEMS AND AND PROVIDER GROUPS THAT HAD EFFECTIVE MONOPOLIES IN THESE RURAL AREAS AND SO TO THE STATE EFFECTIVELY SAID OKAY WELL WE WILL LET YOU FOR EXAMPLE CONTRACT WITHOUT IT INDIANA. AT PROVIDER SYSTEM INSTEAD AND THOSE FOLKS IN OHIO ARE GONNA HAVE TO GO ACROSS STATE LINES TO TO GET THEIR CARE SAID THERE WERE WAS DEFINITELY SOME FLEXIBILITY GIVEN TO THE CARRIERS ON THAT ISSUE. JUST TO GET THEM TO PARTICIPATE. DON'T MEAN TO GENERALIZE BUT IT SEEMS LIKE YOUR TESTIMONY. WOULD STATE THAT MORE INSURANCE CHOICE. BENEFITS INCREASING AFFORDABILITY AND QUALITY. WELL IS WHEN IT COMES TO THE MARKET PLACES THERE IS PRETTY STRONG EVIDENCE THAT THE MORE INSURERS ARE THAT ARE COMPETING. AND THE LOWER THE PREMIUM FOR THE CONSUMER. AND THE LOWER THE ANNUAL PREMIUM INCREASES SO YOUR DATA THOUGH ALSO SEEMS TO SHOW THAT CALIFORNIA WAS HAVING DECREASING NUMBER OF. COMPETITORS WITHIN THE INSURANCE MARKET IS IT THEN. SAFE TO SAY WILL HAVE DECREASING AFFORDABILITY AS WELLAS DECREASING QUALITY WELL STATEWIDE AND THE CALIFORNIA. COURT CALIFORNIA'S HAD PRETTY STABLE ENSURE PARTICIPATION ON AVERAGE. BUT OF COURSE THAT MASK SOME PRETTY BIG REGIONAL DIFFERENCES SO FOR EXAMPLE ON IT YOU KNOW WE SAW MUCH HIGHER PREMIUM INCREASES IN THE NORTHERN% COUNTIES. THIS YEAR THAN IN MORE URBAN AREAS LIKE SAN FRANCISCO SACRAMENTO AND NOT MAYBE AND I CAN'T SAY DEFINITIVELY FOR SURE BUT THAT MAY BE A FUNCTION OF THE LACK OF. BOTH PROVIDER AND INSURER CHOICE. DOVE TAILS HERE NOW ON TO WHAT DOCTOR WHAT IS SAYING. IF WE WERE TO DO A PUBLIC OPTION OR TO LOOK AT A MEDI CAL BY. DOES THAT HELP TO INCREASE AFFORDABILITY AND QUALITY BY HAVING MORE OPTIONS ON. WELL IT COULD BUT AGAIN THE DEVIL WILL BE IN THE DETAILS ON HOW MUCH WILL PROVIDERS BE PAID BY THE PUBLIC OPTION PLAN. WHAT PROVIDERS WILL BE AND THE NETWORK? WILL PUBLIC OPTION PLAN DETER OTHER INSURERS PRIVATE INSURERS FROM COMING IN THEM THAT MIGHT COME IN OTHERWISE SO THOSE ARE ALL SORT OF ISSUES YOU TO SORT OF THINK THROUGH AND AS YOU DESIGN SOMETHING LIKE THAT. FROM FINALLY THESE RATING REGIONS THAT YOU REFERENCED THE NINE TEEN OF THEM. CAN YOU EXTRAPOLATE A LITTLE BIT MORE ON THAT THAT'S A NEW. TERM THAT I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR MORE YEAH SURE SO AS YOU MAY RECALL THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT INCLUDED A NUMBER OF CONSUMER PROTECTIONS. INCLUDING LIMITS ON HOW MUCH INTEREST CAN VARY THE PREMIUM RATES THAT THEY CHARGE CONSUMERS TO FOR EXAMPLE THEY CAN'T CHANGE RATES BASED ON. HEALTH STATUS OR GENDER THERE'S LIMITS ON AGE THERE ALSO LIMITS ON. IDEA THEY ARE ALLOWED TO RATE DIFFERENTLY BASED ON THE GEOGRAPHIC REGION THAT THEY'RE COVERING. BUT THERE ARE LIMITS SO FOR EXAMPLE THEY CAN'T TAKE A TINY SLICE OF LOS ANGELES AND SAY WE'RE GONNA CHARGE. YOU KNOW A THOUSAND DOLLARS IN HERE AND ANOTHER SLICE OF LOS ANGELES AND TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS THERE. THE STATE IS WITH US EACH STATE WAS TOLD TO COME UP WITH WHAT ARE CALLED RATING REACH AND SO. WHILE CARRIERS ARE ALLOWED TO VERY RATES BASED ON. THE GEOGRAPHY THEY CAN ONLY DO IT WITHIN LIMITS CALIFORNIA SET UP NINETEEN RATING REGIONS. AND I AM NOT AN EXPERT IN HOW CALIFORNIA DESIGN THOSE RATING REASONS OR WHAT WHAT. SYPHAC FACTORS THE USED BUT ESSENTIALLY IT'S. YOU KNOW KNOWING THAT FOR EXAMPLE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA HAS AND MUCH HIGHER PROVIDER PRICES AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA SO THAT'S IT'S A DESIGNED TO REFLECT THOSE DIFFERENCES IN PROVIDER BECAUSE. PRIMARILY. I'M GONNA COME BACK TO IT BUT I'M WONDERING NOW IF SOME OF THOSE READING REGION'S MAY PRECIPITATE WHAT WE'RE SEEING WITH THEN PROVIDERS IN REGIONS AS WELL. GEORGE THINK IF I MAY I'D LIKE TO MOVE ON TO. MR PRODI. UP. YOU KNOW I REALLY WANTED TO DO IN ON THIS BECAUSE. YOU SAID THAT. THE PHYSICIAN PARTICIPATION IN MEDI CAL IS INSUFFICIENT AND HAS NOT KEPT PACE WITH THE ENROLLMENT GROWTH. CAN YOU REPEAT WHAT STATE AND FEDERAL POSITION TO PATIENT RATIOS WE ARE NOT MEETING AS A STATE AND. DOES THAT PUT AT RISK ANY FUNDS FOR US AS. WELL THERE WERE SOME NATIONAL A GUIDELINES. ESTABLISHED BY THE COUNCIL ON GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION. QUITE SOMETIME AGO. AND THOSE ARE THE FEDERAL GUIDELINES AND I'M REFERRING TO THE STATE THAT DEPARTMENT HEALTH CARE SERVICES. FOR PRIMARY CARE HAS ESTABLISHED. PRIMARY CARE TO MEMBER RATIOS FOR ITS MANAGED CARE PLANS. AND THAT'S THE STATE RATIO THAT I'M REFERRING TO. AND WITH THAT. LARGE EXPANSION AND. MEDICAL PROGRAM. HOW WE GOING SEEN A RELATIVELY MODEST EXPANSION IN THE NUMBER OF PHYSICIANS PARTICIPATING OR AT LEAST IN THE SHARE OF THEIR TIME PARTICIPATING? IN IN MEDI CAL AYE AND SORT HASN'T KEPT PACE A TO THE BEST OF MY KNOWLEDGE WE'RE NOT. PUTTING AT RISK ANY. FEDERAL FUNDS PER SE. UNDER THE LAST ADMINISTRATION THERE WAS. QUITE A CLOSE LOOK. BY THE ADMINISTRATION ON CALIFORNIA'S ACCESS ISSUES THERE WAS SOME MANDATED STUDIES THAT CALIFORNIA MUST DO. THINK THE LEGISLATURE SUPPORT AS WELL LEGISLATION THAT CALIFORNIA'S MANDATED TO DO BECAUSE THEY WERE CONCERNED ABOUT. ACCESS AND HOW IT MIGHT. CHANGE AFTER THE EXPANSION. AND AND FRANKLY THERE WERE CONCERNS EVEN BEFORE THE EXPANSION ABOUT ACCESS AND MEDI CAL SO. THERE HAS BEEN AT TIMES FEDERAL PRESSURE OR TO ON CALIFORNIA ABOUT. ENSURING APPROPRIATE ACCESS BUT TO MY KNOWLEDGE. THERE HOW MANY FEDERAL PENALTIES. FOR NOT BEING AS REQUIREMENTS. YOU EARLIER YOU HAD MENTIONED THAT PUBLIC PLANS WERE DOING A BETTER JOB OF INVESTING. INTO TARGETED PROGRAMS TO EXPAND ACCESS TO CHURCH SEEMS LIKE THIS IS. A WAY TO ENCOURAGE. THOSE PUBLIC PLANS TO MAKE SURE THAT WERE TRAINING OF THE WORKFORCE OF TOMORROW PARTICULARLY IN REGIONS LIKE MINE. THE NEXT QUESTION I WAS HOPING TO ASK. IN LIGHT OF THE FACT THAT WE LEARNED THAT FIVE TO TEN THOUSAND. MEDI CAL THE COVERED CALIFORNIA PATIENTS WERE CHURNING EACH MONTH. ARE THERE THINGS THAT MEDI CAL OR COVERED CALIFORNIA COULD DO TO BETTER. TO BETTER PREVENT INDIVIDUALS FROM HAVING GAPS IN COVERAGE. BUT I KNOW THERE'S A NUMBER OF EFFORTS ALREADY UNDER WAY. TIMES WHEN THINGS. THERE'S IT YOU KNOW THERE'S ALREADY BEEN A NUMBER OF EFFORTS UNDER WAY AT THE ADMINISTRATIVE LEVEL TO. TO IMPROVE THOSE HANDOFFS. WHEN PEOPLE CHANGE COVERAGE EITHER. THEIR INCOMES GO UP IN THERE. THEY'RE NO LONGER HALOGEN FOR MEDI CAL. AND VICE VERSA SORT OF A WARM HAND OFF BETWEEN. WHEN WHEN THAT PEOPLE UNCOVER CALIFORNIA LONGER ELIGIBLE THAT COVER CALIFORNIA SHARING INFORMATION WITH THE STATE TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S. THERE'S. THEN SOMEHOW REACHED ON TED TO INDIVIDUALS. YOU KNOW MORE CONSISTENCY AND PROVIDER NETWORKS WOULD PUT CERTAINLY HELP. WE TALKED ABOUT THAT ISSUE. EARLIER IN TERMS OF THERE'S A NUMBER OF COMPLEXITIES ABOUT WHY THAT DOESN'T DOESN'T HAPPEN. CERTAINLY PAYMENT RATES ARE ARE ARE ONE OF THEM. BUT THERE'S A NUMBER OF OTHERS SO. BEYOND THAT I'M NOT MUCH I HAVE OTHER IDEAS TO OFFER. THEM MENTIONED AT THE END OF MY TALK ONE OPTION AVAILABLE TO THE STATE TO US. WEAVER. IT WOULD BE TO IMPOSE TWELVE MONTH CONTINUES ELIGIBILITY. OR A FOR MEDI CAL ADULTS YOU HAVE IN PLACE FOR CHILDREN ALREADY. BUT THAT WOULD BE AN OPTION WOULD REQUIRE AMENDING YOUR STATE WAIVER. ANOTHER ISSUE THAT COMES UP IS. WHETHER OR NOT. MANAGED CARE PLANS THAT ARE OFFERING TO THE MEDI CAL PROPERLY XIN THEY MAY OR MAY NOT ALSO BEOFFERING. COVERED CALIFORNIA PLANS AS PART OF THEIR SERVICE LINES. AND EVEN IF THEY ARE OFFERING BOTH THEY MAY OR MAY NOT BE OFFERING BOTH IN A PARTICULAR GEOGRAPHIC AREA. SO THERE ARE THINGS THAT SOME STATES HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT WHETHER THAT'S FAVORABLE CONTRACTING TERMS FOR PLANS THAT OFFER BOTH. ON THE EXCHANGE AND IN THEIR MANAGED CARE MEDICAID MANAGED CARE POPULATION SO THERE ARE SOME AVENUES YOU CAN GO DOWN THERE AS WELL TO ENSURE THAT. AN INDIVIDUAL TURNING OUT OF ONE PROGRAM AND THE OTHER COULD HAVE A SOFT LANDING SPOTS IN A PLAN THAT LOOKS VERY MUCH LIKE THE PLAN THAT THEY'RE COMING OUT OF IN TERMS OF PROVIDER NETWORKS AND. SO THOSE WOULD BE TO TO OPTIONS THAT THAT YOU COULD CONSIDER. NEXT I'D LIKE TO TURN TO TALK. AND. YOU KNOW I'M. PLEASE TYPE TRADING DATA UCSF FRESNO. RESIDENCY TRAINING PROGRAM AND KNOW THE HARD WORK THAT MANY OF YOU ACADEMICS ARE DOING. AND REALLY WANT TO FOCUS IF I COULD ON. THE UNDER CAPITALIZATION MEDICAL EDUCATION PARTICULARLY AS WE LOOK AT REGIONS THAT ARE BEING LEFT BEHIND. THOSE NUMBERS JUMPED OFF THE PAGE TO ME COMING FROM THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY IN FROM THE INLAND EMPIRE. AS THE FIRST LATINO MEDICAL DOCTOR THAT OUR STATE IS EVER ELECTED TO STATEWIDE OFFICE I'M QUITE AWARE MYSELF THAT THERE ARE VERY. FEW OF US WHO HAVE A VOICE. SO I'D LIKE YOUR OPINIONS ON HOW WE CAN BETTER INCREASED DIVERSITY TO ENSURE THAT PEOPLE. ARE. BUILDING TRUST BOTH CULTURALLY AND LINGUISTICALLY WHAT THE PEOPLE WHO ARE PROVIDING CARE. OKAY SO HOW TO INCREASE. DIVERSITY IN THE PHYSICIAN WORKFORCE ON HEALTH WORKFORCE GENERALLY. WELL YOU KNOW I THINK THERE ARE. CERTAINLY NUMBER ONE IS ADDRESSING OUR EDUCATIONAL INEQUITIES. MANY OF OUR LATINO CHILDREN AFRICAN AMERICAN UNDER ITS ASIAN. YOU KNOW WHAT ATTEND SCHOOLS ARE THAT. DO NOT PREPARE THEM AS WELL. FOR COLLEGE ENSUED DOING WHAT WE CAN UP TO PREPARE THEM YOU HAVE IN YOUR DISTRICT AS I THINK YOU KNOW DOCTOR I'M CATHY FLORES AND OTHERS WORKING ON THE DOCTOR'S A COMMANDING ME THAT'S EVEN WONDERFUL EXAMPLE. OF OF WORKING WITH PROMISING. YOUNG UP PEOPLE FROM MANY RACIAL ETHNIC GROUPS IN THE CITY OF FRESNO AND SURROUNDING RURAL AREAS SO THAT'S IMPORTANT THE OTHER PLACE WHERE WE KNOW A LOT OF. YOUNG PEOPLE. PARTICULARLY YOUNG UNDERREPRESENTED MINORITY YOUNG PEOPLE FALL OFF THE TRACK FOR HEALTH PROFESSIONS IS IN COLLEGE. THAT A LOT OF THEM GET TO COLLEGE HE AND YOU KNOW IT PARTIBUS ACADEMIC IT IS SOME CHALLENGES IN ACADEMIC PREPARATION. PART OF IT IS SOCIAL YOU GO TO A COLLEGE WHERE A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T LOOK LIKE YOU. THEIR FAMILIES HAVE MUCH MORE MONEY THAN YOU DO. YOU HAVE TO YOUKNOW YOU ARE BECAUSE YOU ARE LARGELY SELF FINANCING YOUR EDUCATION YOU ARE. LEADING UP TO WORK QUITE A BIT AND SO A LOT OF YOUNG PEOPLE THEY DON'T DO THAT WELL IN WHAT WE CALL. A. EITHER POLITELY THE GATEWAY COURSES OR NOT SO POLITELY THE WAITER COURSES. AND MATHEMATICIAN AND CRITICALLY IN CHEMISTRY THEY DON'T DO WELL. THEY GET DISCOURAGED AND THEY TAKE THEMSELVES OUT OF THE RUNNING UNFORTUNATELY SOMETIMES. THEY GET BAD ADVICE FOCUSING WELL YOU KNOW IF YOU GOT TO SEE IN CHEMISTRY FORGET ABOUT IT NINO IT'S HOPELESS DON'T YOU SHOULDN'T DO ANYTHING. IN THE HEALTH PROFESSIONS AND SO WE NEED MUCH BETTER ADVISING AGAIN WE HAVE EXAMPLES YOU HAVE A. A PROGRAM AT CSU FRESNO. YOUR HEALTH CHRIS OPPORTUNITY PROGRAM THAT'S WORKS VERY HARD AND NUMBER OF OUR. UC'S HAVE PROGRAMS THAT WE NEED MORE THAT I THINK ON EVERY COLLEGE CAMPUS IN CALIFORNIA WE NEED SOMETHING THAT WORKS FOR US OUR YOUNG PEOPLE FROM DISADVANTAGED BACKGROUNDS WHO HAVE A PASSION TO SERVE. IN THE HEALTH PROFESSIONS TO SAY WHAT CAN WE DO TO GET YOU TO THE PLACE WHERE YOUR COMPETITIVE TO ENTER A HEALTH PROFESSION AND IF NOT. MEDICINE OR DENTISTRY YOU KNOW MAYBE THERE'S A ROLE FOR YOU IN PUBLIC HEALTH. AND IN ANOTHER PROFESSION BUT BUT TO YOU KNOW NOT DISCOURAGE THAT PASSION BUT JUST YOU MUST HAVE KNOWN THAT I. USE TO BE A COP WORKED WITH THE DOCTORS ACADEMY DR FLORISSANT HAD SOME STUDENTS AS WELL. TURNOUT UP FOR. KNOW HOW IMPORTANT IT IS FOR OUR COMMUNITY TO HAVE PROBLEMS JUST LIKE. YOU KNOW FIGHT CANNOT. LIKE TO MOVE ON TO MR GRAVES ONLY SO THAT I CAN ENSURE THAT WE HAVE TIME FOR PUBLIC DIM QUESTIONS AS WELL. YOU KNOW I WAS. REALLY MOVED BY. THE TESTIMONY WHERE HE SAID MORE LIKELY TO TRANSITION WHEN I'M LOOKING AT THOSE RISK FACTORS WHAT I LOOK AT IS MY COMMUNITY. YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. YOUNG. HISPANIC LATINOS WHO ARE IN SERVICE INDUSTRIES THAT THE. COMMUNITY I REPRESENT AND. THE TURNING SEEMS TO INCREASE UTILIZATION AND INCREASE COST. HOW HEARD AT THE END YOU WERE REALLY WANTING US TO TAKE A LOOK AT PROVIDER DIRECTORIES? SAID THAT WE NEED TO ENSURE ACCURATE AND UP TO DATE PROVIDER DIRECTORIES. HOW? WHAT SPECIFICALLY COULD WE DO OR MANDATE TO ENSURE THAT THE PROVIDER DIRECTORS WE HAD ARE ACTUALLY ADEQUATE? WELL I SHOULD I SHOULD SAY. THE IMPACTS OF TURN ON UTILIZATION REALLY GO BOTH WAYS. THAT THAT INCREASING UTILIZATION IS ONCE THEY GET BACK ON A PLAN. BUT THEN THERE'S OF COURSE THE DROP OFF IN UTILIZATION THAT OCCURS AS WE SAW WITH THE SELF REPORTED THIRTY FOUR PERCENT DROPPING A MEDICATION. THAT HAPPENS SAY IF THEY TRANSITION AWFUL PLAN INTO SOME PERIOD OF BEING ON IT SHORT SO I I WOULD I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT IT GOES BOTH WAYS. BUT IT FROM A HEALTH SYSTEM PERSPECTIVE YOU WE SEE THAT UTILIZATION INCREASE. WHICH IN TURN WOULD INCREASE THE PLAN COSTS AND PREMIUMS AND AND THINGS LIKE THAT. IN TERMS OF STRATEGIES FOR ENSURING UP TODAY PROVIDER NETWORKS. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. DID GO DOWN THE ROAD OF OF PENALIZING PLANS. THERE'S A LONG HISTORY OF ENSURING. PROVIDER NETWORK ADEQUACY THROUGH THE MEDICARE ADVANTAGE PROGRAM FOR EXAMPLE THERE STEEP PENALTIES IMPOSED ON INSURERS. THERE'S AUDITS. SECRET SHOPPER STUDIES ANY NUMBER OF AVENUES THAT THAT YOU COULD GO DOWN. AS WAS MENTIONED EARLIER THE ROLE OF REGULATION A PROVIDER NETWORKS HAS LARGELY BEEN REACTIVE I IN MANY STATES THAT IS A REACTIVE TO SPECIFIC CONSUMER COMPLAINTS ABOUT NOT BEING ABLE TO PROVIDE. ARE TO TO FIND A PROVIDER AS OPPOSED TO. OF A MORE. A DIFFERENT STRATEGY OF EITHER FINING OR. R. AUDITING PLANNED. GREAT AND. WITH THAT I THINK WE WILL MOVE ON TO OUR NEXT PANEL AND. THANK YOU ALL FOR COMING HERE. THANK YOU VERY VERY MUCH APPRECIATED. SO OUR NEXT PANELIST SO THAT THE NEXT PANEL WILL BE UNDERSTOOD ABOUT UNDERSTANDING ADDRESSING HIGH PRICES. SO I HAVE. AARON TRASK. LAURENCE BAKER. AND THAT OUR A RETURN OF WELL OF LARRY LEVITT I. WHICH. GENERATED SUNSET BUT. AND WHERE. WE'RE GONNA GO FOR. LIKE LAST THANK YOU. FIRST I'D LIKE TO INTRODUCE AARON TRASH THE ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR OF HEALTH POLICY AT THE SHE FOR CENTER FOR HEALTH POLICY AND ECONOMICS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THINK YOU TO THE CHAIRS INTO THIS COMMITTEE AND TO THE STAFF FOR HOSTING THIS MEETING AND FOR INVITING ME TO GIVE SOME REMARKS HERE TODAY. WE'VE HEARD A LOT FROM THOSE PRYOR'S OF PANEL IMPAIR SPEAKERS ABOUT FRAGMENTATION IN OUR SYSTEM. IN TERMS OF KIND OF SOURCES OF HEALTH INSURANCE COVERAGE AND I'D LIKE TO SHIFT GEARS A LITTLE BIT AND THINK ABOUT. THAT FRAGMENTATION AND ITS IMPACT ON HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS IN THE SENSE THAT OUR PROVIDERS ARE TREATING PATIENTS WHO ARE COVERED BY DIFFERENT SOURCES OF COVERAGE. AND GETTING PAID VERY DIFFERENT RATES. IN DOING SO. AND SO THE KIND OF EMPHASIS TODAY IS IN THINKING ABOUT YOU KNOW WHAT DOES THAT MEAN FOR PROVIDERS HOW ARE THEY GETTING PAID HOW TO THESE PRICES VARY. AND WHAT MIGHT IT MEAN IF WE START TO THINK ABOUT APPROACHES TOWARD A MORE UNIFORM RATE SETTING STRUCTURE ACROSS DIFFERENT PAYERS IN THE STATE. THINK I'LL JUST START UP BY SETTING A QUICK DEFINITION WHEN I TALK ABOUT PAYMENT RATES ARE REIMBURSEMENT TO PROVIDERS WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT IS THE TOTAL ACTUAL DOLLARS THAT ARE P. TO THAT PROVIDER FOR TREATING A PATIENT. AND THOSE DOLLARS COULD BE PAID BY SOME COMBINATION PERHAPS OF THE HEALTH PLAN AND SOME PATIENT OUT OF POCKET COST SHARING IN THE FORM OF A DEDUCTIBLES OR CO INSURANCE THE KIND OF THAT. THE TOTAL ACTUAL PRICE THAT THE PROVIDER RECEIVES. AYE AS REIMBURSEMENT FOR TREATING THESE PATIENTS. SO WE'VE HEARD ABOUT THE KIND OF THREE MAJOR SOURCES OF HEALTH INSURANCE COVERAGE ON IN CALIFORNIA AND ALSO ACROSS THE COUNTRY THE MEDICARE PROGRAM COMMERCIAL HEALTH PLANS ARE PRIVATE HEALTH PLANS. AND ALSO THE MEDICAID PROGRAM. AND BEFORE GETTING INTO THE KIND OF VERY DIFFERENT. LEVELS OF PAYMENT RATES THAT THESE DIFFERENT PROVIDERS PAY HAVE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE HELPFUL THAT JUST ALSO SET THE STAGE A IN IN. EXPLAINING THAT THE THEY ARRIVE AT THESE RATES IN VERY DIFFERENT WAYS AS WELL. AND SO IN THE CASE OF THE MEDICARE PROGRAM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ADMINISTRATIVELY SETS PAYMENT RATES AND BASICALLY SAYS HERE'S WHAT WE PAY HOSPITALS AND PHYSICIANS FOR TREATING MEDICARE PATIENTS. TAKE IT OR LEAVE IT. MOST PROVIDERS CHOOSE TO TAKE IT INTO TREAT MEDICARE PATIENTS AND ACCEPT THOSE PAYMENT RATES. BUT ULTIMATELY THERE'S REALLY NO BACK AND FORTH IN IN THIS IT'S A IT'S A LEVEL THAT SET BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. IN VERY STRONG CONTRAST TO THAT WE HAVE THE COMMERCIAL MARKET WHERE PRIVATE HEALTH PLANS ENGAGE IN NEGOTIATIONS WITH PROVIDERS LIKE HOSPITALS AND PHYSICIANS. AND ESSENTIALLY NEGOTIATE WHAT IS THE LEVEL OF PAYMENT GOING TO BE. AND ULTIMATELY THESE PAYMENT RATES REFLECT THAT THE KIND OF RELATIVE BARGAINING LEVERAGE BETWEEN PROVIDERS IN BETWEEN HEALTH PLANS IN THE AREA. AND TEND TO VARY CONSIDERABLY I'M ACROSS DIFFERENT PROVIDERS IN DIFFERENT COMMERCIAL HEALTH PLANS. FINALLY IN THE CASE OF THE MEDICAID PROGRAM IT'S UP TO STATE GOVERNMENTS TAKEN TO DETERMINE THE LEVEL OF REIMBURSEMENT RATES IN THEIR MEDI IN THEIR RESPECTIVE MEDICAID PROGRAMS. AND IN THE CASE OF CALIFORNIA THE MEDICARE PART MEDI CAL PROGRAM THE STATE GOVERNMENT SETS UP PAYMENT RATES FOR PHYSICIANS. AND NEGOTIATE PAYMENT RATES WITH HOSPITALS. SO WHAT DOES THIS LOOK LIKE IN TERMS OF WHAT A PROVIDER ACTUALLY GETS PAID FOR TREATING A PATIENT THAT'S COVERED ONE OF BY WHAT BY ONE OF THESE DIFFERENT SOURCES OF INSURANCE COVERAGE. SO FIRST I'M GONNA FOCUS ON HOSPITALS FOR THE FOR THE FIRST YOU SLICE AND THEN WILL SWITCH TRANSITION TO PHYSICIANS. BUT THIS CHARTER SHOWING YOU THAT AVERAGE PAYMENT THAT A HOSPITAL RUSHED RECEIVES FOR TREATING AN IN PATIENT. FOR TREATING A PATIENT AS AN IN PATIENT IN THE HOSPITAL DEPENDING ON THE SOURCE OF INSURANCE COVERAGE OF THAT PATIENT. SO THE TOP LINE IS AN ORANGE THIS IS PATIENTS COVERED BY PRIVATE HEALTH PLANS. THE MIDDLE LINE IN IN PURPLE IS A MEDICARE PATIENTS AND THE BOTTOM LINE AND BLEW HIS MEDICAID PATIENTS. AND WHAT YOU CAN SEE IS THAT ON AVERAGE ACROSS THE COUNTRY PRIVATE HEALTH PLANS ARE PAYING HOSPITALS CONSIDERABLY MORE THAN MEDICARE AND MEDICAID PAYS THOSE HOSPITALS. SO IN TWENTY TWELVE IT WAS ABOUT SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OR ABOUT THREE QUARTERS MORE FOR TREATING. PRIVATELY INSURED PATIENTS FOR ESSENTIALLY THE SAME SERVICE AS A MEDICARE MEDICAID PATIENTS IN YOUR HOSPITAL. ONE OTHER KIND OF IMPORTANT TAKEAWAY POINT FROM THIS CHART IS THAT THAT RELATIVE MARKUP FOR THESE HIGHER RELATIVE PAYMENTS FROM PRIVATE HEALTH PLANS. HAVE INCREASED CONSIDERABLY OVER TIME AND SO BACK IN THE EARLY NINETIES AND EARLY TWO THOUSANDS PRIVATE HEALTH PLANS WERE PAYING AND MODESTLY OR JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE THAN MEDICARE. AND IN MORE RECENT YEARS WERE AT THE POINT WHERE PRIVATE HEALTH PLANS ARE PAYING CONSIDERABLY MORE THAN MEDICARE AND MEDICAID PROGRAMS ARE PAYING HOSPITALS. NOW THESE ARE AVERAGE. PAYMENTS WHICH. KIND OF MASK AS YOU'VE HEARD IN MANY DIFFERENT INSTANCES TODAY THAT MASK CONSIDERABLE VARIATION. AS OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS GOING TO FOCUS A LOT ON VARIATION IN KIND OF THE DRIVERS OF THIS BUT I JUST WANTED TO POINT OUT THAT THERE'S ESSENTIALLY. HAD THIS MIDDLE OF THE ROAD HOSPITAL THAT'S RECEIVING. ABOUT THREE QUARTERS MORE FOR TREATING A PRIVATELY INSURED PATIENTS AND TREATING A MEDICARE PATIENT THERE'S A LOT OF VARIATION AROUND. THAT KIND A MIDDLE AVERAGE PAYMENT WHERE YOU SEE SOME HOSPITALS GETTING PAID MUCH MORE THAN THAT FOR PRIVATELY INSURED PATIENTS AND SOME HOSPITALS GETTING PAID MUCH LESS THAN THAT FOR TREATING PRIVATELY INSURED PATIENTS. THESE KIND OF RELATIVE MARKUPS OVER WHAT HOSPITALS GET PAID FOR COMMERCIAL PATIENTS COMPARED TO WHAT THEY GET PAID FOR TREATING MEDICARE PATIENTS. THOSE MARKUPS VERY IN MANY DIFFERENT WAYS SO IN ONE WAY THEY VARIAS ACROSS DIFFERENT GEOGRAPHIC AREAS WHERE FOR EXAMPLE. A SIEMENS HOSPITAL PAYMENTS FOR PRIVATELY INSURED PATIENTS TEND TO BE HIGHER IN SAN FRANCISCO MARKET THAN THEY DO IN THE LOS ANGELES MARKET. THEY ALSO VERY ACROSS HOSPITALS WITH IN A MARKET SO THAT IS TO SAY THAT YOU KNOW ONE HOSPITAL IN LA IS GETTING PAID MORE THAN ANOTHER HOSPITAL IN LA ON AVERAGE FROM PRIVATE HEALTH PLANS. THERE'S ALSO VARIATION EVEN WITHIN A HOSPITAL IN THE SENSE THAT DIFFERENT COMMERCIAL PAYERS PAY THAT HOSPITAL DIFFERENT RATES SO THEY MAY HAVE NEGOTIATED A DIFFERENT RATE. FOR THEIR ANTHEM PATIENTS THAN THEY MAY HAVE FOR THEIR HEALTH NET PATIENTS OR KIND OF ALL THESE DIFFERENT SOURCES OF VARIATION. SO AGAIN AS I MENTIONED OTHER NECK SPEAKER WILL KIND OF. DELVE INTO THIS A BIT MORE AND AND THE DRIVERS OF THIS VARIATION BUT WHAT I WANT TO FOCUS ON FOR THE PURPOSES OF MY COMMENTS IS ESSENTIALLY THE NOTION THAT. WE HAVE A LOT OF VARIATION BOTH ON THE PRIOR SLIDE ACROSS DIFFERENT SOURCES OF COVERAGE AND ON THIS SIDE ON THIS SLIDE ACROSS DIFFERENT SOURCES OF PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE COVERAGE. AND IF WE THINK ABOUT MOVING TOWARD A POLICY KIND OF DIRECTION WHICH IS A MORE UNIFORM OF RATE SETTING OR A MORE UNIFORM PAYMENT STRUCTURE APPROACH TO THIS WOULD BE SOMETHING LIKE A SINGLE PAYER SYSTEM. OR EVEN SOMETHING LIKE AN ALL PAYER RATE SETTING A TYPE OF APPROACH. ESSENTIALLY WHAT THAT'S AKIN TO YOU ON THESE CHARTS IS DRAWING A ST HORIZONTAL LINE SOMEWHERE AND SAYING WE'RE GOING TO PAY PROVIDERS AT THIS LEVEL. AND SO WHAT THAT MEANS IN TERMS OF THE KIND OF REACTION OR EXPERIENCE OF PROVIDERS IS GOING TO VARY CONSIDERABLY DEPENDING ON WHERE THEY'RE STARTING FROM BOTH IN THE MIX OF THE TYPES OF PATIENTS THEY SEE. AND ALSO IN THEIR RELATIVE COMMERCIAL PAYMENTS. SO ONE POINT IS THAT ESSENTIALLY KIND OF MOVING TOWARD A MORE UNIFORM RATE STRUCTURE IS GOING TO CREATE WINNERS AND LOSERS AND THAT'S GOING TO BE YOU KNOW CREATE ITS OWN SET OF CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES. A SECOND POINT IS JUST FUNDAMENTALLY WHERE DO YOU DRAW THAT LINE AT WHAT LEVEL IS THE APPROPRIATE AMOUNT OF PAYMENT TO BE PAID IF WE'RE GOING TO MOVE TOWARD ONE SIDE OF RATES. THERE'S A LOT OF STOCK IN FIGURING OUT AND SETTING THAT AT AN APPROPRIATE LEVEL. SETTING TOO HIGHLY OF SYSTEM KIND OF FISCAL CONSTRAINTS AND IN YOUR YOU KNOW IS THIS THE RIGHT ALLOCATION OF RESOURCES AND ARE WE SPENDING TOO MUCH ON HEALTHCARE. SETTING THAT RITA TO LOWER THE LEVEL COULD LEAD TO CONCERNS ABOUT ACCESS AND WORKFORCE KIND OF FUTURE OUR INCENTIVES TO TO ENTER INTO THE HEALTHCARE PROFESSION AND THE QUALITY OF CARE THAT'S DELIVERED. AND SO ONE KIND OF POTENTIAL STARTING POINT IN THINKING ABOUT HOW YOU MIGHT SET THAT READ OR HOW YOU MIGHT START THINKING ABOUT WHERE USES AT THAT RATE IS TO LOOK PERHAPS TO WHAT MEDICARE PAYS HOSPITALS. THIS IS A VERY MEDICARE'S VERY LARGE PAYER OF HOSPITALS HAS A VERY KIND A WELL KNOWN PUBLICLY AVAILABLE RATE STRUCTURE THAT THEY PAID TO HOSPITALS. AND SO YOU CAN THINK ABOUT YOU KNOW AS A STARTING POINT IF WE LOOKED AT THE MEDICARE PAYMENT. THE HOSPITAL PAYMENT MECHANISM AS A STARTING POINT FOR FOR REACHING THIS KIND OF UNIVERSAL RATE STRUCTURE. WHAT WOULD THAT MEAN FOR HOSPITALS ARE ESSENTIALLY OUR MEDICARE'S? PAYMENT RATES TO HOSPITAL SUFFICIENT IN TERMS OF COVERING HOSPITAL'S COSTS. SO IT TURNS OUT THAT ON AVERAGE ACROSS THE COUNTRY THE ANSWER IS ESSENTIALLY THAT THEY'RE NOT THAT. ON AVERAGE HOSPITALS LOSE MONEY ON MEDICARE PATIENTS OUR HOW THE OPERATING MARGIN IN TERMS OF THEIR MEDICARE PATIENTS OF ABOUT NEGATIVE SEVEN PERCENT. SO WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT THE PAYMENTS THAT THEY RECEIVE FOR MEDICARE PATIENTS DO NOT COVER THE COSTS THEY INCUR FOR TREATING MEDICARE PATIENTS ON AVERAGE ACROSS THE COUNTRY. BUT AGAIN THIS MASKS VARIATION ACROSS DIFFERENT TYPES OF HOSPITALS AND SO IF YOU SEE IN THIS. THIS CHART BELOW THEIR THEIR WE'VE KIND OF GROUP HOSPITALS OR THE AUTHORS HAVE GROUP HOSPITALS INTO THREE DIFFERENT POCKETS. HEAD OF DEPENDING ON ESSENTIALLY. AT HOW MUCH MONEY THEY LOSE OR DON'T LOSE ON MEDICARE PATIENTS SO THE FIRST THAT OF CALLED SO THIS IS BROKEN UP BY THEN THE PROFIT MARGIN ON MEDICARE PATIENTS. THE FIRST US HEAD OF COLUMNS IS ESSENTIALLY HOSPITALS THAT LOSE A LOT OF MONEY TREATING MEDICARE PATIENTS. THE MIDDLE SET OF COLUMNS IS PETER'S AYE HOSPITALS THAT LOSE HIM MODERATE TELL TO SMALL AMOUNTS OF MONEY ON TREATING MEDICARE PATIENTS. AND THE RIGHT MOST COLUMN IS HOSPITALS THAT ACTUALLY HAVE POSITIVE PROFIT MARGINS ON MEDICARE PATIENTS OR MAKE MONEY TREATING MEDICARE PATIENTS. AND SO THAT THE POINTS HERE ARE KIND OF ESSENTIALLY THAT THERE ARE IN FACT SOME HOSPITALS THAT HAVE POSITIVE PROFIT MARGINS AT MEDICARE RATES. AND THE SECOND PULL BUT THERE ARE MANY THAT DON'T AS WELL RATE AND THE SECOND. KIND OF POINT IMPORTANT POINT HERE IS THAT. REALLY THIS VARIATION STEMS FROM HOSPITAL COSTS AND THE COST STRUCTURE. THAT DIFFERS ACROSS THESE HOSPITALS. AND SO YOU THINK ABOUT YOU KNOW STARTING FROM A PLACE OF MEDICARE PAYMENT RATES AND AND WOULD THAT BE AN ADEQUATE AMOUNT OF PAYMENT TO PAY HOSPITALS OR SHOULD WE GO UP FROM THERE HOW MUCH SHOULD WE THINK ABOUT GOING UP FROM THERE. ON THE ONE HAND ON AVERAGE MEDICARE PAYMENTS ARE NOT COVERING COSTS ON THE OTHER HAND THERE ARE SOME HOSPITALS THAT ARE ABLE TO MAKE THIS WORK AND THERE'S SOME EVIDENCE AND AND PERHAPS SOME SUGGESTION THAT. YOU KNOW WE THAT HOSPITALS THAT HAVE TO RESPOND TO STRONGER FISCAL PRESSURE AND STRONGER COST CONSTRAINTS ARE ABLE TO OPERATE MORE EFFICIENTLY AND REDUCE THEIR COST STRUCTURE. AND THAT YOU MAY GET SOME OF THOSE BENEFITS BUT THIS IS THAT AT A YOU KNOW TOUGH BALANCING POINT BETWEEN SETTING A RATE TOO HIGH AND SETTING A RE TO LOW AND THEIR IMPLICATIONS ON BOTH SIDES. OF OUT WHERE YOU DIED OUT ON THAT. ONE OTHER IMPORTANT POINT FOR THINKING ABOUT KIND OF. CONVERGING TOO A STANDARDIZED PAYMENT APPROACH IS NOT JUST THE THE RATE OR THE LEVEL THAT YOU MIGHT SET THESE PAYMENTS. BUT ALSO THE MECHANISM FOR HOW YOU KIND OF DESIGN THESE PAYMENTS TO HOSPITALS. SO IT TURNS OUT THAT NOT ONLY DO THE LEVELS OF PAYMENT VARY ACROSS MEDICARE MEDICAID AND COMMERCIAL INSURERS. BUT ALSO HOW THEY ACTUALLY THE METHOD OR HOW THEY ACTUALLY A KIND OF DESIGN THESE PAYMENTS AND THE METRIC FOR THOSE PAYMENTS ALSO VERY ACROSS PAYERS. SO IN THE CASE OF THE MEDICARE PROGRAM. MEDICARE PAYS HOSPITALS USING SOMETHING CALLED DIAGNOSIS RELATED GROUPS ARE DRG USE WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY A FIXED. PAYMENT FOR A GIVEN CONDITION AND SO IF YOU'RE PATIENT THAT SHOWS UP WITH A JOINT REPLACEMENT IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER WHETHER YOU SEE IN OURS TEN TIMES A DAY OR FIVE TIMES A DAY OR IF YOU STAY FOR DAYS OR THREE DAYS. THE MEDICARE PAYMENT IS GOING TO BE THE SAME FOR THAT FIX CONDITION THERE SOME MINOR ADJUSTMENTS FOR HELL OTHER KIND HEALTH CONDITIONS IN THOSE TYPES OF THINGS BUT GENERALLY SPEAKING. FIXED PAYMENT FOR CAN PER CONDITION. NOW IN CONTRAST TO THAT MANY COMMERCIAL PAYERS IN CALIFORNIA ACTUALLY USE A PER DIEM BASED REIMBURSEMENT STRUCTURE FOR HOSPITALS. AND SO THAT MEANS THAT THEY'VE ESSENTIALLY NEGOTIATED A PER DAY READ THAT THE PATIENT STAYS IN THE HOSPITAL. IN THE CASE OF THE MEDI CAL PROGRAM THERE WAS A RECENT POLICY CHANGE WHERE OUR STATE MOVED FROM PER DIEM BASED PAYMENTS TO DRG BASED PAYMENTS. AND SO THEY'RE KIND OF. ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES TO DIFFERENT WAYS OF PAYING HOSPITALS AND DIFFERENT TYPES OF INCENTIVES BUT THE OVERARCHING POINT IS THAT NOT EVERYONE'S DOING THIS THE SAME WAY AND AS YOU THINK ABOUT THE KIND OF CHALLENGES AND AND ALSO POTENTIALLY OPPORTUNITIES. OF MOVING TOWARD A UNIFORM. TYPE OF PAYMENT. NOT ONLY ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT THE LEVEL BUT YOU'RE ALSO TALKING ABOUT THE MECHANISM FIRST FOR HOW YOU ENGAGE IN PAYING PROVIDERS. ONE FINAL COMMENT ON A IN TERMS OF. HOSPITAL REIMBURSEMENT IN CALIFORNIA. IS OUT LOOKING OUT RELATIVE PAYMENT LEVELS FROM THE MEDICARE PROGRAM TO HOSPITALS. AND IF YOU MEMBER FROM THE FIRST SLIDE ON AVERAGE ACROSS THE COUNTRY MEDICAID PAYMENTS TO HOSPITALS ARE JUST BELOW WERE A PRETTY SIMILAR TíNH TED MEDICARE PAYMENTS TO HOSPITALS JUST SLIGHTLY BELOW. AND IN TERMS BUT AGAIN YOU MAY BE PICKING UP ON THE THEME THAT MASKS A LOT OF VARIATION ACROSS STATES IN TERMS OF HOW STATE SET THEIR THEIR HOSPITAL PAYMENTS FOR THE MEDICAID PROGRAM. SO THIS. DASHED LINE IN THE MIDDLE IS THAT ONE WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY THE THE NATIONAL AVERAGE PAYMENTS TO HOSPITALS FOR TREATING MEDICAID PATIENTS. AND WHAT YOU SEE IS THA CALIFORNIA FALLS VERY MUCH IN THE MIDDLE OF THE BALLPARK HERE IN THE SENSE THAT WE'RE VERY CLOSE TO THE NATIONAL AVERAGE IN TERMS OF OUR. MEDI CAL PAYMENTS TO HOSPITAL. SO JUST TO KIND OF SUMMARIZE WHAT I'VE REVIEWED ON HOSPITALS ESSENTIALLY THAT THE TAKEAWAY POINT IS THAT PRIVATE INSURERS TEND TO PAY MUCH MORE. THAN MEDICARE AND MEDICAID PROGRAMS IN TERMS OF OF PAYMENTS TO HOSPITALS FOR TREATING PATIENTS ESSENTIALLY WITH THE SAME CONDITION. AND THAT YOU MOVING TOWARD MORE OF A UNIFORM RATE STRUCTURE WOULD CREATE WINNERS AND LOSERS DEPENDING ON WHERE YOU SET THAT LEVEL. AND ALSO WHERE DIFFERENT HOSPITALS KIND OF STE FALL NOW COMPARED TO WHERE YOU SET THAT LEVEL. MOVING INTO ITS AS AN INFORMATION ABOUT PHYSICIAN PAYMENTS THAT THE KIND OF GENERAL OVER ARCHING STORY IS PRETTY SIMILAR TO THE HOSPITAL STORY IN THAT COMMERCIAL HEALTH PLANS TEND TO PAY. A HIGHER THAN MEDICARE AND MEDICAID TENDS TO PAY LESS THAN MEDICARE BUT THERE'S SOME KIND OF IMPORTANT NUANCES OUR DIFFERENCES. AYE TO GO THROUGH ON THE PHYSICIAN REIMBURSEMENT SIDE AS WELL. BUT SO THE KINDA MEAN STARTING POINT HERE SO THIS IS DATA ON A NATIONAL AVERAGE PAYMENTS FOR A PRIMARY CARE ESSENTIALLY OFFICE VISIT CHECK UP. AND WHAT YOU CAN SEE IS THAT ON AVERAGE OF PATIENTS WITH EMPLOYER SPONSORED INSURANCE COVERAGE POSITIONS THAT TREAT THOSE PATIENTS ARE GETTING PAID ON AVERAGE ABOUT EIGHTEEN PERCENT HIGHER THAN THEY GET PAID FOR TREATING MEDICARE PATIENTS. I'M SO AGAIN A MARKUP OVER MEDICARE ALTHOUGH NOT AS BIG OF A MARK UP AS WE SAW IN THE HOSPITAL SIDE. I'M IN CONTRAST THE THEY HAD A RELATIVE PAYMENT LEVELS FROM MEDICAID PLANS ARE MUCH LOWER ON IN THE SENSE THAT ON AVERAGE ACROSS THE COUNTRY UP. PHYSICIANS GET PAID ABOUT THREE QUARTERS. OF WHAT THEY WOULD HAVE GOTTEN PAID FOR TREATING A MEDICARE PATIENT WHEN THEY TREAT A MEDICAID PATIENT. STARTING FROM THIS KIND OF. MARKUP OF ABOUT EIGHTEEN PERCENT OVER MEDICARE FOR THE COMMERCIALLY INSURED PATIENTS. THAT'S THE THAT KIND OF A BASIS FOR PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS BUT WE ACTUALLY SEE THAT THIS RELATIVE MARKUP OVER MEDICARE VARIES CONSIDERABLY ACROSS DIFFERENT TYPES OF PHYSICIANS. AND WE SEE MUCH HIGHER MARKUPS OVER MEDICARE OF FOR SPECIALISTS SO FOR EXAMPLE COMPARED TO THAT EIGHTEEN PERCENT HIGHER PAYMENT FOR PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS FOR AN OFFICE VISIT. ON AVERAGE RADIOLOGISTS INTERPRETING A CAT SCAN WOULD GET PAID ABOUT DOUBLE FOR TREATING A COMMERCIALLY INSURED PATIENTS. OUT COMPARED TO WHAT THEY WOULD GET FOR A MEDICARE PATIENTS. INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH THOUGH IN THINKING ABOUT CALIFORNIA AND KIND OF HOW WE COMPARE TO THE NATIONAL PICTURE IT TURNS OUT THAT PRIVATE HEALTH PLANS IN CALIFORNIA ACTUALLY APPEAR TO BE DOINGA KIND OF BETTER JOB THAT AVERAGE. AT CONSTRAINING THE USE OF MARKUPS IN THE IN THE COMMERCIAL MARKET SO WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS THAT. COMMERCIAL A PAYMENT RATES IN CALIFORNIA ARE LOWER THAN AVERAGE ACROSS THE COUNTRY. I MEAN YOU SEE AGAIN THAT. COME THAT PAYMENT RATES TO PHYSICIANS FOR COMMERCIALLY INSURED PATIENTS ARE HIGHER IN SAN FRANCISCO THAN IN LOS ANGELES BUT IN BOTH MARKETS IN THIS CASE AT LEAST IN THIS YEAR A SOURCE THEIR LOWER THAN THE AVERAGE ACROSS THE COUNTRY. I FINALLY ONE LAST POINT ON PHYSICIAN PAYMENTS IS FOCUSING IN ON THE MEDI CAL PROGRAM AND THIS IS ANOTHER. SOURCE WHERE CALIFORNIA ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF CALIFORNIA BEING A PARTICULARLY LOW OUT WIRE. SO THIS IS NOW LOOKING AT MEDICAID PAYMENTS FOR TREATING A MEDICAID PATIENT AS COMPARED TO A MEDICARE PATIENT. WHAT YOU SEE IS ON AVERAGE POSITIONS GET PAID ABOUT THREE QUARTERS OF? WHAT THEY WOULD HAVE GOTTEN PAID FOR MEDICARE PATIENTS WHEN THEY TREAT A MEDICAID PATIENTS? IN CONTRAST IN CALIFORNIA THAT I'VE THAT'S CLOSER TO ABOUT HALF AS MUCH. SO PHYSICIANS ARE RECEIVING VERY LOW REIMBURSEMENT FOR TREATING MEDICARE PATIENTS BOTH COMPARED TO OTHER PAYERS LIKE MEDICARE BUT ALSO IN COMPARE IN COMPARISON TO OTHER STATES AROUND THE COUNTRY THAT WE HAVE A PARTICULARLY LOW REIMBURSEMENT. OF RATE STRUCTURE FOR PHYSICIANS IN THE MEDICAL PROGRAM. NOW THAT HAS IMPLICATIONS YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT ON ACCESS AND PARTICIPATION BUT JUST ONE SLIDE HERE TO TO. KIND OF REITERATE THIS POINT AND AND DRAW THE CONNECTION BETWEEN PAYMENT RATE LEVELS AND ACCESS TO CARE. ON THIS IS A SURVEY OF PHYSICIANS THAT ASKS. WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO ACCEPT A NEW PATIENTS IN YOUR PRACTICE. AT AND THEN FOLLOW THAT UP WITH WHAT AND WHAT'S THEIR SOURCE OF INSURANCE COVERAGE AND SO ACROSS THE COUNTRY ABOUT SIXTY NINE PERCENT OF PHYSICIANS WOULD BE WILLING TO ACCEPT IN NEW MEDICAID PATIENTS. IN CONTRAST IN CALIFORNIA WERE MUCH LOWER THAN THAT ABOUT FIFTY FOUR PERCENT. NOW IN CONTRAST IN CALIFORNIA ABOUT SEVENTY SEVEN PERCENT OF PHYSICIANS SAY THEY WOULD BE WILLING TO ACCEPT A NEW A A NEW COMMERCIALLY INSURED OR OUT MEDICARE INJURED PATIENT. SO YOU DON'T NECESARIAMENTE COMPARE THE FIFTY FOUR PERCENT TO A HUNDRED BUT STILL WERE CONSIDERABLY LOWER THAN THE NATIONAL AVERAGE IN TERMS OF ACCEPTING A NEW MEDICAID PATIENT AND ALSO MUCH LOWER THAN WHAT YOU SEE. OF FOR COMMERCIALLY INSURED AND MEDICARE INSURED PATIENTS. SO ESSENTIALLY JUST JUST SUMMARIZE OF WHAT I SAID ON PHYSICIANS. THAT COMMERCIAL MARKUPS OVER MEDICARE. EXIST IN THE PHYSICIAN MARKET AT LEAST ON AVERAGE AS WELL. THEIR MORE MODEST FOR OFFICE VISITS AND TEND TO BE MUCH HIGHER FOR SPECIALISTS. ON CALIFORNIA'S PRIVATE HEALTH INSURERS APPEAR TO BE DOING HAVE A BETTER JOB THAN THE NATIONAL AVERAGE IN TERMS OF HOLDING DOWN THESE MARKUPS OVER MEDICARE FOR. FOR COMMERCIALLY INSURED PATIENTS BUT MEDI CAL PHYSICIAN FEES ARE PARTICULARLY LOW ESPECIALLY IN COMPARISON TO NATIONAL METRICS. SO TAKE AWAY POINTS ON PROVIDER PAYMENT OVER ALL I THINK IF I CAN LEAVE YOU. WITH WITH TWO MAIN POINTS OF AND IT SAYS ONE IS THAT DIFFERENT US SORT DIFFERENT PAYERS ARE DIFFERENT SOURCES OF HEALTH INSURANCE COVERAGE. ARE PAYING PROVIDERS VERY DIFFERENT RATES FOR DOING THIS SEEMS SERVICE PROVIDING THE SAME SERVICE TO PATIENTS. AND SO YOU NO IT THAT KIND OF SPECIFICS VARY BUT THE GENERAL MESSAGE IS THAT IF YOU THINK ABOUT HOW TO MEDICARE BEING IN THE MIDDLE THAT PRIVATE HEALTH INSURERS ARE PAYING MUCH MORE THAN MEDICARE AND MEDICAID TENDS TO BE PAYING. LESS THAN MEDICARE NOW HOW BIG THOSE GAPS ARE AND YOU KNOW THAT THAT TYPE OF THING VARIES ACROSS DIFFERENT TYPES OF SERVICES DIFFERENT HOSPITALS DIFFERENT SPECIALISTS. ON DIFFERENT PRACTICES ALL OF THOSE THINGS BUT THE GENERAL MESSAGES. MEDICARE IN THE MIDDLE PRIVATE INSURANCE ABOVE MEDICAID BELOW. I THINK THE SECOND POINT IS ESSENTIALLY JUST THAT YOU KNOW FOODS IN KIND OF PICKING UP ON SOME OF THE THE FRAGMENTATION ISSUES THAT WE'VE DISCUSSED. THAT THESE UP PROVIDERS HAVE TO KIND OF DEAL WITH THE ADMINISTRATIVE CHALLENGES OF YOU KNOW SENDING OF OF NEGOTIATING CONTRACTS WITH MANY DIFFERENT PAYERS. OF. ESSENTIALLY LEARNING HOW TO SUBMIT THEIR CLEANS AND ACCURATELY KIND OF GET THESE THINGS PROCESS WITH THESE DIFFERENT PAYERS. AND ALSO MANY DIFFERENT PAYERS YOU KNOW HAVE INCENTIVE PROGRAMS FOR PHYSICIANS ARE FOR HOSPITALS AND YOU KNOW MEDICARE INCENTIVIZE IS PARTICULAR TYPES OF CARE. MEDICAID MAY HAVE DIFFERENT KIND OF GOALS ARE DIFFERENT.% FINANCIAL LEVERS TO IN INFLUENCE POSITION AND BEHAVIOR HOSPITAL BEHAVIOR EVEN DIFFERENT PRIVATE HEALTH PLANS YOU KNOW ONE MAY BE IMPLEMENTING A PAY FOR PERFORMANCE PROGRAM ANOTHER MAYBE IMPLEMENTING. MORE ABOUT KIND OF VALUE BASED CARE OR KIND OF THE ON TOTAL COST OF CARE TYPE PROGRAM. AND AND PROVIDERS REALLY HAVE TO THINK ABOUT YOU KNOW HOW DO I RECONCILE ALL OF THESE DIFFERENT INCENTIVES ALL OF THESE DIFFERENT INTERACTIONS WITH PAYERS. AND THAT'S ADMINISTRATIVELY CHALLENGING IT CAN ALSO BE CHALLENGING FOR THEM TO SHAPE THEIR KIND OF PRACTICE DECISIONS AROUND ALL OF THESE DIFFERENT. OUR CONTRACTS THAT THEY'RE PRESENTED WITH IN THIS FRAGMENTED SYSTEM TODAY. AND SO ONE OPPORTUNITY FOR MOVING TOWARD A MORE UNIFIED KIND OF RESTRUCTURE IS THINKING ABOUT YOU COULD KIND OF STREAMLINED THOSE PROCESS THESE AND YOU WOULD HAVE A VERY LARGE PATIENT VOLUME YOU COULD POTENTIALLY REALLY. ON ENCOURAGE PHYSICIANS TO DO DIFFERENT THINGS WITH THEIR PATIENTS WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT ALL OF THEIR PATIENTS AND NOT JUST A THIRD OF THEIR PATIENTS ARE HALF OF THEIR VISION. BUT ON THE OTHER HAND YOU KNOW WE WHEN WE HAD A MOVE TOWARD ONE SINGULAR APPROACH FIRST OF ALL. GET SETTING NOT THAT GREAT LEVEL RIGHT IN THAT KIND OF MECHANISM RIGHT BECOMES VERY IMPORTANT AND THAT'S VERY CHALLENGING AND THAT'S GOING TO MEAN DIFFERENT THINGS FOR DIFFERENT PROVIDERS IN TERMS OF WHERE THEY ARE TODAY. IT ALSO CAN STIFLE SOME OF THESE ARE POTENTIAL INNOVATIONS IF ONE INSURER IS THINKING OF SOMETHING DIFFERENT THAN MEDICARE DIFFERENT THAN A DIFFERENT PRIVATE INSURER. IF YOU MOVE JUST TOWARD ONE APPROACH YOU LOSE SOME OF THAT INNOVATION AND EXPERIMENTATION AND SEEING WHAT WORKS AND WHAT WORKS MIGHT DIFFER IN DIFFERENT SETTINGS. SO YOU MAY LOSE SOME OF THE ABILITY TO KIND OF MONITOR AND EVALUATE AND FALLS IN THAT WAY. BUT I THINK ESSENTIALLY THE POINT IS YOU KNOW THERE ARE MANY. KIND OF CONCERNS AND CHALLENGES AND ADMINISTRATIVE DIFFICULTIES. WITH WITH THE KIND OF CURRENT SYSTEM TODAY PROVIDERS RECEIVE VERY DIFFERENT PAYMENT LEVELS ACROSS THEIR DIFFERENT PATIENTS. AND THAT YOU KNOW THERE OPPORTUNITIES IN MOVING TOWARD A UNIFIED APPROACH BUT IT'S NOT IT'S AT NOT. SMALL HURDLE TO THINK ABOUT SETTING THAT. APPROPRIATELY THAT'S GOING TO REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE FROM THE STATUS QUO THAT'S GOING TO MEAN VERY DIFFERENT THINGS TO DIFFERENT PROVIDERS. AND IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO KIND OF STEPPED OUT AT THE RIGHT LEVEL AND DOING SO WILL HAVE VERY HURT OR NOT DOING SO WOULD ESSENTIALLY HAVE. VERY PROBLEMATIC POTENTIALLY VERY PROBLEMATIC CONSEQUENCES ON A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT ANGLES. AND A PATH NOT. GREAT BIG THANK YOU. VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THAT OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS A PROFESSOR LAURENCE BAKER. WHO IS A HEALTH ECONOMIST AND PROFESSOR OF HEALTH RESEARCH AND POLICY AT STANFORD? WHERE HE APPLIES ECONOMIC AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS TO STUDY CHALLENGES FACING THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM? PROFESSOR. THANK YOU ABOUT THE FLOODS COME UP. LOOK PROMISING THANK YOU SO MUCH. CHAIR WOULD CHAIR AROUND WITH THEM MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE IT'S A PLEASURE TO BE HERE AND TALK WITH YOU ABOUT PRICE VARIATIONS AND CONSOLIDATION SO BE BASED ON SOME OF THE WORK THAT. THAT I'VE DONE WITH COLLEAGUES AND OTHERS HAVE DONE. I'M. WHAT'S HE SO I WAS I MIGHT THE OUTLINE GENERALLY SUPPLY CLIP ABOUT PRICE VARIATIONS PARTICULARLY AND HOSPITALS AND DOCTOR TRISH IS DONE A LITTLE BIT OF THAT SO OUT. IT PASSED A LITTLE BIT OF WHAT THE BEGINNING AND I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE ROLE OF CONSOLIDATION THE HOSPITAL MERGERS PARTICULARLY AND THEIR EFFECT ON PRICES AND HOW WE. THINK ABOUT THAT AND THEN COME AROUND AT THE END TOO LITTLE DISCUSSION OF SOME THINGS THAT A STATE MIGHT THINK ABOUT IN TERMS OF. MANAGING SOME OF THE PRICE ISSUES THAT WE HAVE THE HEALTH CARE SO. HOW ONE GUY TO SPEND THE CONTEXT HEALTHCARE IS REALLY EXPENSIVE? YOU SHOULD TWEAK THAT. PRICES ARE AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF HEALTHCARE SPENDING INCREASES WE TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT BUT WE WE USE A LOT OF HEALTH CARE IN THE THE TYPES AND THE AMOUNTS OF HEALTH CARE WE CONSUMER PART OF OUR STORY. BUT PRICES PARTICULARLY OVER THE LAST FIVE OR TEN YEARS HAVE BEEN OF A BIG PART OF IT OF THE INCREASES THAT WE'VE BEEN SEEING. I AND THE PART OF THE STORY WITH PRICES IS THE FACT THAT WE TEND TO USE MARKET MECHANISMS AT LEAST QUITE OFTEN IN THE U. S. HEALTHCARE SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA. TO SET THESE PRICES MARKETS HAVE SOME THINGS TO RECOMMEND THEM IN MARKETS CAN FAIL. AND IF MARKETS FAIL THEN WE MAY COME UP WITH PRICES THAT WERE NOT SO HAPPY WITH. CONSOLIDATION MERGERS THE FORMATION VERY LARGE SYSTEMS AND PROVIDER NETWORKS IS AYE IS PART OF THE STORY OF MARKET FAILURE POTENTIALLY IN THE HEALTHCARE. WE TALKED ABOUT THIS A LITTLE SO VERY JUST OUT TO SO MOST SKIP PAST THIS IMMEDIATELY HEALTHCARE PRICES OF BEEN RISING VERY QUICKLY HOSPITALS ARE A PART OF THAT. THIS SLIDE HIGHLIGHTS SIX PERCENT INCREASES IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN ALONE IN MEDICAL HOSPITAL ADMISSION PRICES. AYE THAT'S CONSIDERABLY FASTER THAN INFLATION IT'S A GOOD COMPONENT OF RAPIDLY RISING HEALTHCARE COSTS AND IT GOES ACROSS DIFFERENT SECTORS I'M FOCUSING ON HOSPITALS PARTICULARLY IT SO YOU SEE THAT HOUSE. AS DOCTOR TRICIA'S MENTIONED THERE ARE IMPORTANT VARIATIONS IN HOSPITAL PRICES AROUND THE COUNTRY AND WITH IN CALIFORNIA. THIS IS IN SOME SENSE A REITERATION OF THE SLIDE THAT THAT SHE HAD A MOMENT AGO AYE THIS SIMPLY COLORS PARTS OF CALIFORNIA AND PARTS OF THE COUNTRY. ACCORDING TO AN AVERAGE PRICE FOR A HOT A BASKET OF HOSPITAL SERVICES CALCULATED FROM ABOUT DATA FROM PRIVATE INSURANCE COMPANIES. I AND THE DARKEST BLUE AREAS ARE THE HIGHEST THE LATEST BLUE AREAS ARE THE LOWEST AND IF I'M PERMITTED A CERTAIN STATISTICAL FLEXIBILITY THERE'S ABOUT A THREE TIMES DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TOP AND THE BOTTOM HERE. AND SO YOU SEE CVM. THAT PARTS OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA MORE% OFTEN LOOKING A LITTLE BIT LIGHTER COLORED THAN PARTS OF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA SOME BIG PRICE DIFFERENCES WITHIN CALIFORNIA BUT OF COURSE IF YOU LOOK AROUND THE STATEMENT RUN THE COUNTRY. THINGS VERY QUITE A BIT FROM ONE PLACE TO ANOTHER. SIMILARLY TO WHAT WE'RE JUST TALKING ABOUT. I'M GONNA SKIP TO THIS SLIDE RIGHT HERE. THERE ARE IMPORTANT DIFFERENCES ACROSS PAYERS AGAIN IS DOCTOR TRICIA'S POINTED OUT MEDICAID AND MEDICARE PRICES ARE OFTEN LOWER. THEN COMMERCIAL PRICES ARE AND THE ONLY POINT THAT I WOULD MAKE TO ADD ON TO THAT IS THAT FOR IS IN THE SLIDE HERE WHICH IS BASED ON WORK THAT I DID WITH COLLEAGUES A LITTLE WHILE AGO IN WHICH WE. LOOKED AT MEDICARE PRICES COMPARED TO COMMERCIAL PRICES BUT ALSO COMPARED TO MEDICARE ADVANTAGE PRICES. I MEDICARE ADVANTAGE PLANS ARE ARE PRIVATE PLANS A CONTRACT WITH THE MEDICARE PROGRAM TO TAKE CARE SENIORS ARE WHO ELECTED ROLE IN THOSE PLANS. AND THOSE MEDICARE ADVANTAGE PLANS LOOK AT SOMETHING LIKE COMMERCIAL PLANS IN THAT THEY NEGOTIATE THE PRICES WITH HOSPITALS THAT ARE GOING TO BE IN THEIR NETWORK SO THEY HAVE A. DIFFERENCE THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE PRICES THAT ARE USED FOR HOSPITALS OUT WENT OUT. TRADITIONAL MEDICARE PATIENT IS SEEN AT A HOSPITAL WHICH ARE ADMINISTERED PRICES SET OUT THROUGH A ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESS WASHINGTON. AND COMMIT AND MEDICARE ADVANTAGE PRICES WHEN A SENIOR AND A MEDICARE ADVANTAGE PLAN GOES TO THE HOSPITAL THEY'LL RECEIVE THE HOSPITAL WILL BE PAID OUT NEGOTIATED RATE WITH THE MEDICARE ADVANTAGE PLAN. WHEN WE MAKE COMPARISONS HERE WE IN THIS PARTICULAR PAPER IN THE STUDY WE LOOKED AT FEE FOR SERVICE MEDICARE PRICES IN TWO THOUSAND NINE AND TWO THOUSAND TWELVE FOR A BASKET OF TWENTY FIVE COMMENT SERVICES. AND WE LABEL THAT PRICE ONE HUNDRED IN THE MIDDLE IN THE RED BAR. WE THEN LOOK AT THE PRICES THAT COMMERCIAL PLANS ARE PAYING FOR THAT SAME BASKET IN THE SAME GEOGRAPHIC AREAS. WE SEE THE GREEN BARS IN THEIR CONSIDERABLY HIGHER AS WE. NOTED BEFORE. SIXTY FIVE PERCENT HIGHER IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE. BUT THEN WE LOOK AT THE MEDICARE ADVANTAGE PRICES SAME BUNDLE OF SERVICES AGAIN IN THE SAME GEOGRAPHIC AREAS PAID BY NOW MEDICARE ADVANTAGE PLANS. AND HERE THEY'RE ACTUALLY WILL BE LOWER NINETY PERCENT NINETY ONE PERCENT EVEN THOUGH THESE ARE. SIMILAR TO COMMERCIAL PLANS IN A LOT OF WAYS AND I WANT TO POINT OUT THE DIFFERENCE BECAUSE WILL COME UP WHEN WE TALK ABOUT POSSIBLE. THAT ACTIONS THAT SOMEONE MIGHT TAKE. IT SEEMS TO US WHEN WE DID THIS RESEARCH AND LOOKED AT THESE RESULTS THAT HAVE VERY PORTANT CONSIDERATION IS THAT. CONTEXT IN WHICH THE NEGOTIATIONS HAPPENING. IN A COMMERCIAL PLAN ADDICT IN THE COMMERCIAL PLAN CONTACTS IF A HOSPITAL IN A PLAN DON'T REACH AGREEMENT. AND THE HOSPITAL IS LEFT OUT OF THE NETWORK OF THE PLAN IF A. PERSON FROM THAT PLAN. GOES TO THE HOSPITAL THEY. WILL BE CHARGED OUT OF NETWORK RATES WHICH CAN BE SET AT THE DISCRETION OF THE HOSPITAL AND. THIS I'M SURE OFTEN CAN BE QUITE HIGH. IN THE MEDICARE ADVANTAGE CONTACTS WHEN. HEALTH PLAN NEGOTIATES WITH A HOSPITAL IF THEY DON'T REACH AN AGREEMENT AND THE HOT HOSPITALS OUT OF THE NETWORK. BUT A PATIENT GOES THERE ANYWAY THE HOSPITAL IS PAID THE MEDICARE FEE FOR SERVICE RATE THEY DO NOT GET TO SET THE RATE THAT THEY WOULD LIKE. THAT IS THAT AND TO IT THERE CONSTRAINED TO NEGOTIATE WITHIN THAT. BALANCE OF KNOWING THAT IF THEY DON'T AGREE ON A RATE THEN PATIENTS THERE MAY BE OUT OF THE NETWORK PATIENTS WILL STILL BE ABLE TO GO THERE. BUT THEY'LL BE OUT THE HOSPITAL ONLY BE PAID TO MEDICARE RATE WHICH IS A SIGNIFICANT CONSTRAINT ON THE NEGOTIATIONS. WHEN THE PRICES ARE BEING SET BETWEEN THE PLAN IN THE HOSPITAL AND YOU CAN SEE HERE RESULTS IN VERY DIFFERENT PRICES EITHER COME OUT OF THOSE NEGOTIATIONS. THE CONTEXT CAN BE IMPORTANT AYE THAT'S THE POINT THAT I WOULD WANT TO MAKE FROM THIS. SO THAT'S SLIDER A VERSION OF IT A MINUTE AGO SHOWING AGAIN THAT MEDICAID PAYMENT RATES ARE. SIMILAR TO MEDICARE PAY RATES A LITTLE BIT LOWER FOR HOSPITALS IN THE COMMERCIAL AS MUCH. OKAY SO SO A LITTLE BIT NOW AND. THE ROLE OF CONSOLIDATION ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S BEEN HAPPENING RAPIDLY. IN THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS AROUND THE COUNTRY AYE IS CONSOLIDATION OF PROVIDERS I'VE. FOCUSED HERE ON HOSPITALS AB WE'LL TALK ABOUT MERGERS OF HOSPITALS TO FORM LARGER SYSTEMS. OTHER FORMS OF INTEGRATION BETWEEN MULTIPLE HOSPITALS TO. BUT THEMSELVES IN A POSITION TO WORK TOGETHER TO BARGAIN TOGETHER FOR FOR THE PRICES THAT THEY'LL BE PAID. THIS US SLIDE HIGHLIGHTS BEEN NUMBER OF MERGERS THAT THE AMERICAN HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION HAS DETECTED OVER THE LAST. QUITE A NUMBER OF YEARS NOW BACK TO NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT. AND YOU CAN SEE IN THE GREEN BARS A LOT IN MANY YEARS HUNDREDS OF HOSPITALS AROUND THE COUNTRY MERGING QUITE A FEW DEALS SINCE TWO THOUSAND TEN. A FIVE HUNDRED AND SIXTY ONE HOSPITALS IS HAPPENING IN CALIFORNIA AS WELL I TO THE POINT WHERE THERE ARE FEWER AND FEWER INDEPENDENT HOSPITALS IN THE STATE. MOST OF THE MARKETS IN CALIFORNIA ARE DOMINATED BY A COUPLE OF LARGE SYSTEMS ARE ONE OR TWO LARGE PLAYERS SOME CASES THREE. AND DUH THAT NORMAL METRICS THAT WE HAVE FOR IT FOR IDENTIFYING HIGHLY CONCENTRATED MARKETS WHICH TO BUT MOST OF OUR HOSPITAL MARKETS ARE CONCENTRATED. AYE IN AN ECONOMIC SENSE. CONSOLIDATION IS ALSO HAPPENING IN OTHER PARTS OF THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM AS WELL PHYSICIAN PRACTICES ARE GETTING LARGER. AYE IN THIS IS HAPPENING TO MERGERS IT'S ALSO HAPPENING THROUGH NORMAL ATTRITION OF. OR CHANGES IN THE THE DEMOGRAPHICS IN THOUGH THE WORK PATTERNS OF PHYSICIANS NEW PHYSICIANS TEND TO ENTER AND JOIN LARGER PRACTICES. OLDER PHYSICIANS AS THEY EXIT TEND TO BE LEAVING SMALLER PRACTICES AND SO THAT TENDS TO REINFORCE THE. DIRECTION OF THE MOVEMENT AS WELL. YOU CAN SEE SOME STATISTICS UP THERE IN THAT. IN WORK THAT WE'VE DONE OVER THE TWO THOUSANDS AND NOW INTO A TWENTY FIVE THIRTEEN AND FOURTEEN. VERY SUBSTANTIAL INCREASES IN THE NUMBER OF PHYSICIANS IN CALIFORNIA IN THE COUNTRY AYE AND PRACTICES OF MORE THAN A HUNDRED. AND TO ADD TO THE POINT WHERE IT'S NOW THIRTY FORTY PERCENT OF THE PHYSICIANS IN THE COUNTRY ARE IN THOSE THAT THAT SIZE A PRACTICE. THERE'S IMMIGRATION THAT'S BEEN GOING ON BETWEEN HOSPITALS AND PHYSICIANS SO YOU'LL HEAR ABOUT HOSPITALS PURCHASING THE PRACTICES OF PHYSICIANS OR OTHERWISE FORMING ORGANIZATIONS IN WHICH LARGE. MULTIPLE TYPE PROVIDER TYPE OF ORGANIZATIONS ARE FORMING. THERE'S BEEN CONSOLIDATION OF INSURANCE COMPANIES AND PROPOSED CONSOLIDATION SOME OF WHICH WAS NOT ALLOWED BY THE COURTS BUT SOME OF WHICH IS GONE THROUGH OVERTIME. I TWO POINT WE HAVE FEWER INSURANCE COMPANIES THAT WORKING IN THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM AS WELL. AND THEN I WILL EVEN LEAVE OFF OTHER KINDS OF THE IMMIGRATION IT'S BEEN HAPPENING THERE ARE CASES IN WHICH AYE INSURERS ARE INTEGRATING WITH HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS. ACCOUNTABLE CARE ORGANIZATIONS ARE VERSION OF INTEGRATION WITH LOTS OF DIFFERENT KINDS OF. ENTITIES OVER TYPE SO I THERE QUITE A FEW VERSIONS OF INTEGRATION IT'S DRIVING LARGER AND LARGER ORGANIZATIONS ON THE PROVIDER SIDE PARTICULARLY TO SOME EXTENT ON THE INSURANCE SIDE. MISS AFFECT THE BARGAINING. THAT DETERMINES THE PRICES THAT ARE CHARGED IN THE COMMERCIAL SPACE. WE CAN WALK THROUGH A MINUTE ON WHY THIS IS HAPPENING. THREE OR FOUR THINGS COME UP. LET'S SEE. THERE'S. ONE IS JUST SIMPLY THE TREND THERE'S BEEN A A. GLOBAL TREND IF YOU WELL TOWARD CONSOLIDATION THERE ARE LARGER AND LARGER ORGANIZATIONS IN MANY. PARTS OF THE ECONOMY IN HEALTH CARE IT'S GOTTEN GOING OVER THE LAST DECADE OR SO AND I THINK PART OF THE TREND NOW IS JUST MAKING SURE YOU'RE NOT THE LAST ONE STANDING BY YOURSELF. I'VE EVERYONE ELSE'S MERGING IN GETTING BIGGER SO THERE'S A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF TRENDING TO IT. AYE BUT IT'S PARTLY ALSO REACTION TO POLICY PAYMENT REFORMS. MEANINGFUL USE FOR AYE IT SYSTEMS FOR HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS EYES ALL SEEM TO REWARD LARGER ENTITIES THAT CAN MANAGE THE COMPLEXITY OF THESE KINDS OF ARRANGEMENTS BETTER SO SOME TO SOME EXTENT BEING PUSHED BY POLICY. SOME EXTENT IT'S IN A ATTEMPT TO IMPROVE MARKET POSITION AND A GAIN OF PRICING ADVANTAGE TO ENHANCE REFERRALS IF YOU HAVE A BIGGER STRUCTURE YOU MAY BE IN A BETTER POSITION TO SURVIVE IN THE MARKETPLACE. I AND I OWN I MENTION THIS MINUTE AGO THERE'S I THINK IN A LOT OF PARTS OF THE ECONOMY YOU'LL SEE LARGER ORGANIZATIONS AS IT AND COMMUNICATIONS AND MANAGEMENT ABILITIES. YOU HAVE EVOLVED OVER THE YEARS TO MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO RUN LARGE ORGANIZATIONS MAYBE IN WAYS THAT YOU COULDN'T TWENTY YEARS AGO. I LEFT ONE OFF FEAR THAT I'LL JUST MENTION THAT IS I THINK THERE'S POSSIBILITY ALSO THAT THESE LARGE ORGANIZATIONS CAN HAVE QUALITY. ADVANTAGES IN SOME CASES THEY MAY BE ABLE TO DO A BETTER JOB. OF. IDENTIFYING THE BEST TREATMENTS OF DIFFUSING KNOWLEDGE OF HAVING THE INFRASTRUCTURE IN PLACE TO DELIVER HIGHER QUALITY AND SO THAT'S SOMETHING TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION AS WELL. NOW WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE GET THIS CONSOLIDATION. FEW DIFFERENT THINGS HAPPEN. ONE THING THAT HAPPENS IS GENERALLY HIGHER PRICES. AND SO PRETTY MUCH THE ACADEMIC RESEARCH THAT IS LOOKED AT CONSOLIDATION SUGGEST THAT WHEN YOU GET. MORE CONCENTRATED MARKETS WHEN YOU GET LARGER AND LARGER ENTITIES BUT SPREADING IN BARGAINING AYE THEY HAVE SOME MARKET POWER THAT THEY CAN EXERT IN THAT BARGAINING AND THEY CAN INCREASE THE PRICES THAT THEY ARE ABLE TO GET. THIS HAPPENS AT HOSPITALS. PLAY HAPPENS FOR PHYSICIAN GROUPS IT HAPPENS IN AND OF. PRETTY BROAD VARIETY OF CONTEXT AYE AND THE LITERATURE IS PRETTY CONSISTENT ON THIS POINT. INSURANCE BARRED INSURANCE CONSOLIDATION ON THE OTHER HAND THE COUPLE OF STUDIES THAT WE HAVE SIX GOES THE OTHER DIRECTION IF YOU CONSOLIDATED SHARON'S COMPANIES YOU TEND TO GET LOWER PRICES OF COURSE THEY. BARGAIN ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE TABLE AND THEY TEND TO FORCE DOWN THE PRICES THAT ARE PAID TO. DOCTORS. EQUALITY EVIDENCE I WILL TELL YOU IS A LITTLE BIT MIX OF BENEFIT YOU STUDIES OUT THERE. DIVERSE. THEY LOOK AT DIFFERENT CONTEXT IT'S. PROBABLY UNDER DEVELOPED IN THE OVERALL SENSE BUT YOU GET SOME MIXED RESULTS ON THE ONE HAND THERE ARE SOME WELL. IDENTIFIED EXAMPLES OF LARGER SYSTEMS THAT DO A GREAT JOB ON MEETING QUALITY STANDARDS ON PROVIDE AND HITTING QUALITY METRICS ON THE KIDS FEW DISCOURSE THAT WE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE. EYES KAISER IS THAT WHEN THE GETS HELD UP FROM TIME TO TIME AS A AS A GOOD EXAMPLE. NO SYSTEM IS PERFECT BUT BUT THEY DO PRETTY WELL ON THEIR QUALITY SQUARES THE INTERMOUNTAIN. THE HEALTH CARE THE GEISINGER CLINIC SOME SOME OTHER EXAMPLES ARE ARE OFTEN HELD UP AS CASES WHERE LARGE ORGANIZATIONS CAN DO BETTER. THAT THE SAME TIME THE ACADEMIC LITERATURE IS A IS. HAS HAS I HAD A HARD TIME FINDING THOSE SAME BENEFITS WHEN YOU LOOK AT JUST THE AVERAGE RUN OF THE MILL MURDER THAT YOU SEE OUT THERE. SO WHEN YOU SEE LARGER GROUPS FORM WHEN YOU SEE MERGERS HAPPEN WHEN YOU SEE THE GENERAL TRENDS THAT WE'VE BEEN HAPPENING AND YOU LOOK OUTSIDE WHAT ARE SOME OF THE. THE BEST PERFORMING LARGE GROUPS WE'VE HAD A HARDER TIME FINDING THE QUALITY ADVANTAGES COMING FROM SOME OF THOSE MERGERS. AYE DESPITE THE HOPE THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN THERE NOW SOME OF THAT LITERATURE IS ONLY FOLLOWED THESE AND TEASE FOR A FEW YEARS I AM. THE LITERATURE ITSELF ISN'T AS BIG AS YOU MIGHT LIKE. AND SO THERE MAY BE MORE TO THE STORY THAN WE KNOW AT THIS POINT BUT IF YOU HAD TO SUMMARIZE IT RIGHT NOW WHAT WE KNOW IS THAT CONSOLIDATION HAS HAS PUSHED SEEMS HAVE PUSHED ALONG PRICE INCREASES. I'M BUT MAYBE NOT ALWAYS PRODUCE THE QUALITY BENEFITS THAT WE MIGHT HAVE HOPED WOULD HAVE COME FROM IT ALTHOUGH THERE STILL ARE SOME FOLKS WHO ARE HOPEFUL THAT THEY MIGHT BE OUT THERE SOMEWHERE. DRIVERS OF HIGH COMMERCIAL PRICES LET'S TALK A LITTLE BIT THEN ABOUT HOW WE BRING THIS BACK TO PRICES IN WHAT WE MIGHT WANT TO THINK ABOUT IN THIS IN THE STATE CUT. WHY PRICES HIGN WHERE THEY GOING UP I THINK CONSOLIDATION IS PART OF OUR STORY? IF YOU LOOK AT THE TRENDS TOWARD LARGE ORGANIZATIONS AYE AND WE LOOK AT. THE. THE PRICE AFFECTS A GO WITH THEM THIS HAS TO BE PART OF THE STORY FOR GOING TO MANAGE PRICES WE PROBABLY HAVE TO. HAVE A LOOK AT CONSOLIDATION IN THE. THERE ARE OTHER SOURCES OF MARKET POWER. ESPECIALLY ON THE PART OF SOME LARGE HOSPITALS EVEN IF YOU'RE NOT IN A BIG SYSTEM BUT YOU ARE A MUST HAVE HOSPITAL FOR EXAMPLE. AYE ANY INSURER WOULD WANT TO HAVE YOUR HAVE TO HAVE YOU IN THE NETWORK IN ORDER TO SELL THEIR PRODUCT. YOU CAN HAVE SOME MARKET POWER AND THAT'LL BE IT AND IT'LL BE A UP DRIVER OF PRICING. OF ALL T!I COST STRUCTURES A IS AN IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION. HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS THROUGHOUT THE STATE THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY HAVE FIGURED OUT HOW TO DELIVER SERVICES. OFTEN VERY VALUABLE SERVICES THAT PEOPLE WANT THAT DOCTORS WOULD LIKE TO BE PROVIDING THAT. COMMUNITIES WOULD BE DISAPPOINTED IF THEY DIDN'T HAVE. SOME OF THE ART ARE EXPENSIVE THOUGH AND CITIES PROVIDERS HAVE MADE INVESTMENTS IN BUILDINGS AND STAFF AND OTHER THINGS THAT HAVE MADE THEIR GIVEN THEM OUT A CONSTRUCT YOUR. AYE THAT CAN BE QUITE EXPENSIVE AND SO THAT'S PART OF IT NEGOTIATION AS WELL AND SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE TO CONSIDER. IF WE START TO THINK ABOUT PRICES WE START TO PUSH TOO MUCH I'M PRICES AYE AND YOU PUSH UP AGAINST SOME OF THESE PROVIDERS ARE HOSPITALS THAT HAVE MADE BIG INVESTMENTS. I COULD PUT SOME THEM IN A DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCE I COULD PUT COMMUNITIES IN DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCES THAT MAKES IT HARDER FOR THEIR THE OTHER POPULATION TO GET THE SERVICES THAT THEY WANT. AT THE SAME TIME WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO. CONSTRAINED PRICE INCREASES THAT ARE WARRANTED AND SO WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THESE COST STRUCTURES AS PART OF THE STORY. I OF COURSE I AS WE GO FORWARD WE CONTINUE TO STRUGGLE HERE AND AROUND THE COUNTRY WITH THE ARRIVAL OF NEW AND COSTLY TREATMENTS THERE ARE SOME TERRIFIC THINGS THAT ARE BEING DEVELOPED. AS SOME OF THEM ARE PHENOMENALLY EXPENSIVE AYE SOME OF THEM MAY BE PHENOMENALLY EXPENSIVE BECAUSE OF THAT THE INSURANCE AYE THAT WE HAVE. BUT THERE MAY BE OTHER THINGS OTHER CONSIDERATIONS THERE TOO THESE ARE THINGS THAT WE HAVE TO CONSIDER. LET ME. I TALK FOR A MOMENT JUST ABOUT THIS UP SUFFICIENT PRESSURE FROM CONSUMERS. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I THINK IS AS BENEFIT CHAIR OF OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. AND PART OF THE NEGOTIATIONS STRUCTURE THAT HAS ALLOWED HIGH PRICES TO SERVES. AS THE FACT THAT THE FOLKS WHO ARE MOST CONCERNED ABOUT HIGH PRICES AND HIGH HEALTHCARE SPENDING ARE PRETTY DIFFUSE. THEIR EMPLOYERS INVOLVED IN PURCHASING HEALTH INSURANCE ARE THE WORKERS ARE INVOLVED ALL OF US THE POPULATION IS INVOLVED AT SOME LEVEL IN PAYING FOR THAT HEALTH INSURANCE. THE GOVERNMENT. STATE GOVERNMENT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS INVOLVED INSURANCE COMPANIES ARE INVOLVED. BUT IT'S. PRETTY DIFFICULT SOMETIMES FOR EVERYBODY TO GET ON THE SAME PAGE WITH WHETHER WE'RE TRYING TO NEGOTIATE FOR LOWER PRICES ARE WE'RE TRYING TO PUSH ON ONE TYPE OF IN ONE AREA OR NOT IN ANOTHER AREA. AND THIS DIFFUSE SIZE SORT OF SENSE OF POWER IN SOME CASES PEOPLE WHO SAY IT'S NOT MY PROBLEM I DON'T KNOW HOW THAT GETS DONE I'M PAYING THE BILL AT SOME LEVEL BUT I HAVE NO AGENCY TO GO OUT. AND TAKE THIS ON IS PART OF OUR PROBLEM. AND IT MAKES IT HARDER TO PUT% PRESSURE ON HEALTHCARE COST GROWTH WHEN WE SEE IT. BECAUSE THERE ARE SO MANY PEOPLE INVOLVED IN SO MANY DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF THE DISCUSSION AND IT'S HARD FOR THEM TO PUT THEIR THEIR FINGER ON IT. ULTIMATELY THAT POPULATION CALIFORNIA PAYS CALIFORNIA'S HEALTHCARE BILLS. BUT I DON'T ALWAYS KNOW HOW MY MONEY'S GOING THROUGH THE SYSTEM AND IT'S HARD FOR ME TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO BE PART OF THAT DISCUSSION AT SOME. SO I THINK THAT MAKES IT MORE DIFFICULT TO IMAGINE THAT WE HAVE A WORLD IN WHICH WE'RE BALANCING THE VALUE THAT WERE GETTING THE PRICE THAT WERE PAYING. IF SO MANY THAT SO MANY DIFFERENT PEOPLE WITH SO MANY DIFFERENT AND SOMETIMES. IMP INCOMPLETE IDEAS ABOUT HOW THE MONEY IS FLOWING ARE PART OF THE DISCUSSION. OKAY SYSTEM POLICY CONSIDERATIONS TO FINISH UP THESE ARE BASICALLY OF TO START IN THE CONTEXT OF A SYSTEM IN WHICH WOULD WHICH WE MAINTAIN SOME OF THE FEATURES OF OUR CURRENT SYSTEM BUT WHAT COULD A STATE DO. TO TRY AND MAKE THE BARGAINING WORKED OUT BETTER IF YOU WILL SO WE GET CLOSER TO PRICES THAT WE CAN. VIEW AS REFLECTING THE VALUE THAT WE LIKE TO BE GETTING FROM OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. THE FIRST THING IS MANAGING CONSOLIDATION AYE WE'VE HAD A TREND TOWARD IT THERE MIGHT I CAN ONLY IMAGINE THERE WILL BE MORE. AND I THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE FOR A STATE TO TAKE AN INTEREST IN THE THE STRUCTURE OF ITS HEALTHCARE MARKETS AND TO TAKE IT TAKE A LOOK AT THAT. I WOULD HAVE TO A COURSE INTERACT WITH FEDERAL EFFORTS THE FTC OF THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE ALSO TAKE AN INTEREST IN MERGERS. AN ANTITRUST POLICY. BUT THESE THINGS AFFECT STATES AS WELL AS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SO TO THE EXTENT THAT THE STATE WOULD WANNA MONITOR ITS MARKETS AND DECIDE IF THERE WERE ACTIONS IT WOULD WANT TO TAKE I THINK THAT'S APPROPRIATE. SOMETIMES DIFFICULT TO KNOW EXACTLY HOW TO DO THAT BUT THERE ARE METRICS THAT EXISTS THERE ARE. AYE DEATH HIRSCHMAN HER FROM DAHLE INDEX BOTHER R. CONSOLIDATION YOU KNOW WE CAN TALK LONGER ABOUT THESE IF YOU WANT TO. CONFIRM MY CLASS SOMETIME WE'LL TALK ABOUT OF A TAIL. YOU KNOW BUT THERE ARE THINGS YOU CAN DO THERE ARE TOOLS YOU CAN USE IN WAYS YOU CAN TAKE A LOOK AT THE US AND THAT MAY BE THAT STATE EFFORTS TO REVIEW MERGERS MIGHT BE APPROPRIATE AND WOULD HELP. I THINK IMPROVING THE CONTEXT FOR ENSURE BARGAINING IS IS HELPFUL SO THERE ARE INSURANCE COMPANIES THAT DO TRY AYE TO NEGOTIATE RATES WITH PROVIDERS AND SOMETIMES. IT'S HARDER FOR THEM THAN IT NEEDS TO BE SO IT MAY BE THAT WE CAN GET SOME ADVANTAGE THERE. I'LL POINT OUT A COUPLE OF THINGS ONE IS I'M JUST A THING TO KEEP IN MIND ONE OF THE INTERESTING TRADEOFFS IS AS WE'VE TALKED ABOUT ISSUES TODAY IS BETWEEN NETWORK STRUCTURE. AYE AND AND BARGAINING ABILITY SO I DOCTOR GRAVES POINTED OUT I THINK IMPORTANTLY THAT. IF YOU HAVE NARROW NETWORKS AND COMPLICATED NETWORKS IT CAN BE HARD FOR PATIENTS. I ONE OF THE THINGS THAT IT IS INTERESTING ONE OF THINGS THAT IS INTERESTING THOUGH IS THAT THE ABILITY OF AN INSURANCE COMPANY TACTIC A HOSPITAL OUT OF THE NETWORK IF THEY DON'T COME UP WITH A REASONABLE PRICE. IS AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF BARGAINING AND SO EFFORTS TO SAY SYSTEMATICALLY SAY EVERY HOSPITAL HAS TO BE IN A NETWORK. I WOULD PUT TREMENDOUS POWER IN THE HANDS OF THE HOSPITAL WHEN THEY WOULD GO TO NEGOTIATE WHAT THEIR RATES ARE GOING TO BE. ON SO THAT'S AN IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION WHEN YOU SET THOSE KINDS OF POLICIES THERE'S CLEARLY ARE CLEARLY TRADE OFFS ON BOTH SIDES BUT WE DON'T WANT TO GO TOO FAR ONE WAY OR THE OTHER WE MIGHT MAKE A MISTAKE. THE SECOND THING I'LL JUST POINT OUT IS THAT LIMITATIONS ON OUT OF NETWORK PRICES CAN HAVE IMPORTANT EFFECTS AS WE SAW WITH MEDICARE ADVANTAGE. I KNOW THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS. MADE SOME EFFORTS TO THINK ABOUT OUT OF NETWORK PRICING AYE AND I'LL SIMPLY SAY THAT THOSE CAN BE. IMPORTANT AYE AND MAY BE VERY VERY USEFUL AND MANAGING PRICE GROWTH A BECAUSE THEY AFFECT THE BARGAINING THAT GOES ON A COMMERCIAL PLANS. AND SO THAT MAY BE SOMETHING TO CONSIDER. ENCOURAGING INDIVIDUAL PARTS OF INSURANCE I THINK IS ANOTHER WAY TO TO STRENGTHEN THE HAND OF PEOPLE WHO ARE NEGOTIATING FOR REASONABLE RATES. ARE COVERED CALIFORNIA'S BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL. AS A MARKETPLACE AND ENCOURAGING THE USE OF THAT TO THE EXTENT THAT THAT THAT STATE POLICY CAN HELP THAT GROW AND FLOURISH. I THINK WOULD. ALSO PUT MORE POWER IN THE HANDS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE NEGOTIATING RATES AND ALLOW SOME PRESSURE TO. BROUGHT TO. I'LL KNOW THAT ENCOURAGING PRICE TRANSPARENCY IS PROBABLY PART OF OUR STORY I'D VERY HARD AS YOU ALL KNOW TO SEE THE PRICES FOR PEOPLE TO KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON AND I KNOW CALIFORNIA'S I'D SAID THEY'RE JUST DISCUSSIONS NOW ABOUT THIS AND I ENCOURAGE. THOSE. I WILL JUST OFFER THE CABBIE OUT THAT ONCE IN AWHILE I'M. SO SOMETIMES WE CALL THIS THE C. E. O. PROBLEM AND AND THEIR ECONOMICS WORLD WHERE. PUBLICATION OF ALL THE CEO SALARIES DID NOT MAKE THEM GO DOWN AYE IT MADE HIM GO UP WHEN THE FOLKS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE PILE FIGURED OUT WHAT THEY COULD BE GETTING IF ONLY THEY DID A BETTER JOB OF NEGOTIATING. RIGHTED SO JUST SIMPLY PUBLISHING ALL THE PRICES IN CALIFORNIA. MIGHT OR MIGHT NOT MAKE THEM GO DOWN IT MIGHT JUST YEAH I INFORM ALL THE PEOPLE GETTING LESS THAT THEY COULD BE SHOULD BE TRYING TO GET MORE. YOU HAVE TO PUBLISH THE PRICES IN THE CONTEXT OF A STRUCTURE THAT ALLOWS THE DOWNWARD PRESSURE TO BE BROUGHT TO BEAR TO USE THAT TO TRY TO DRIVE DOWN PRICES. AND I COME UP TO PRICE REGULATION WHEN I JUST TALKED ABOUT ARE THINGS THAT YOU COULD TRY THAT MIGHT HELP IN THE CONTEXT OF A THE THE SITUATION THAT WE ARE IN NOW. AYE IT MAY BE THAT THOSE ARE INSUFFICIENT TO IF MARKETS ARE TO CONCENTRATED THE HORSES OUT OF THE BARN IF THERE ARE OTHER REASONS THAT WE. ARE GOING TO HAVE A HARD TIME MANAGING IT AYE WE MAY GET TO SOME A SITUATION WHERE WE WANT TO. TALK ABOUT THINGS THAT DOCTOR TRISH WAS TALKING ABOUT TRYING TO MANAGE OUR PRICE STRUCTURE A LITTLE MORE AGGRESSIVELY. I'M I THINK THAT UP FOR ME COMES MAYBE I'M. THAT SOUNDS LIKE IT MIGHT BE CHALLENGING. CERTAINLY WOULD BE POLITICALLY CHALLENGING IN THERE'D HAVE TO BE DISCUSSIONS WITH HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS BUT SOMETHING LIKE THE MARYLAND MODEL DOES OFFER AN OPPORTUNITY TO THINK ABOUT HOW YOU DO THAT. AND MAYBE MOVING IN THAT DIRECTION IS ULTIMATELY WHERE WE NEED TO GET TO GO SO I. I'LL SUGGEST THAT I THINK THAT THAT COULD BE AN IMPORTANT THING TO THINK ABOUT. I'M. WRAPPING UP. MAYBE I JUST NOTICED THAT YOU ARE OFF QUITE FAMILIAR IT SOUNDS ABOUT SUBSIDY ABOUT THESE ISSUES. AYE RURAL AREAS MAY NEED SPECIAL CONSIDERATION IN THESE KINDS OF DISK. A LOT OF THE ECONOMIC THEORIES IN THE ECONOMIC IDEAS PRESUME SOME NOTION SOMEPLACE OF FOUR OUT FOR BARGAINING IN NEGOTIATION AND THAT PRESUMES MULTIPLE HOSPITALS FOR EXAMPLE. THAT YOU CAN TALK TO AND IF YOU DON'T HAVE THAT IN AN AREA. SOME OF THESE WON'T WORK AS WELL AYE AND IF YOU TOOK DRAMATIC ACTION IN A CLOSED HOSPITALS IN RURAL AREAS AND TOOK ACCESS AWAY FROM PEOPLE THAT COULD BE A REAL PROBLEM AS WELL AND SO IT MAY. BE THAT THERE WOULD HAVE TO BE UNIQUE CONSIDERATIONS ARE SPECIAL CONSIDERATION GIVEN. TO RURAL AREAS AND ANY EFFORT TO MANAGE PRICES I'D MIGHT BE THAT YOU NEED TO SYSTEMS IN SOME SENSE TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU DIDN'T DO DAMAGE IN THOSE AREAS. AND I'LL JUST WRAP UP THEN BY MAKING ONE MORE POINT IN THAT IS I THINK THAT I HAVE TALKED A LOT ABOUT PRICES AND THINGS THAT YOU TO DO FOR PRICES. I SPENT A LOT OF MY OWN TIME RESEARCHING THESE ISSUES AND SO I THINK PRICES ARE PARDONED FOR PRICES SAKE. BUT WE SHOULDN'T STOP THERE BECAUSE MANAGING OUR PRICES HAS IMPLICATIONS FOR HOW WE RUN OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM AND FOR THE ACCESS THAT WE CAN MAKE AVAILABLE TO PEOPLE AROUND THE STATE. FOR THE LONG TERM SUSTAINABILITY OF A YOU KNOW THE FINANCING SYSTEMS THAT WE HAVE AND SO. AS I THINK THIS IS IMPORTANT FOR MANY REASONS AND ACTUALLY GETTING A HANDLE ON SOME OF THE HIGH AND RISING PRICES WOULD ALLOW. EFFORTS TO EXPAND COVERAGE TO GO FORWARD MORE EASILY IT WOULD HAVE OTHER IMPORTANT ADVANTAGES AND SO FROM A. BROADER PERSPECTIVE IT'S IMPORTANT I THINK. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY AND NEXT WE HAVE PLAY REAL OF THE CAN THINK. THANKS AGAIN TO THAT TO THE COMMITTEE. AYE AYE I'M WELL AWARE THAT I STAND BETWEEN YOU AND PUBLIC COMMENTS I PROMISE TO BE. TO BE BRIEF. BECAUSE THAT IS CERTAINLY IMPORTANT. AS WELL. AS IT SLIDES ARE BEING. SET UP. YOU KNOW I'M GONNA TALK ABOUT. ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS IN IN THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. AND THAT THIS IS CERTAINLY NOT THE DRIVING FORCE OF OF HEALTH CARE REFORM. AND IT PALES IN COMPARISON TO THE OVERALL EFFORT TO GET MORE AFFORDABLE COVERAGE. AVAILABLE TO MORE PEOPLE. AND YOU CERTAINLY DON'T SEE A LOT ABOUT FIRST OCCURS AROUND SAYING REDUCE HEALTHCARE ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS NOW. BUT. BUT IT IS POTENTIALLY A WAY TO. TO REDUCE COMPLEXITY IN THE SYSTEM. AND ALSO I THINK AS AS LAWRENCE SUGGESTED FREE UP RESOURCES. TO EXPAND COVERAGE. TO THE EXTENT ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS. REPRESENT WASTE IN A SENSE IF WE CAN REDUCE THAT WASTE. THEN WE HAVE MORE MONEY AVAILABLE. TO TO COVER PEOPLE. SO I THINK IT'S HELPFUL TO LOOK AT WHAT WE THINK OF AS AS ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS AND AND I THINK THE WAY TO A THINK ABOUT THIS IS THAT. ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS ARE BASICALLY EVERYTHING WE SPEND IN THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. THAT IS NOT PATIENT CARE. SO THE WAY TO THINK ABOUT THIS IS IT'S KIND OF WHAT WE SPEND FOR. PEOPLE WEARING SUITS. FOR MEN AND WOMEN WEARING SUITS RATHER THAN MEN AND WOMEN WEARING A WHITE COATS OR OR SCRUBS. AND IF HE'S GOING TO GO DOWN THE LIST OF WHAT THIS REPRESENTS. IT CERTAINLY PROFIT. AND YOU KNOW MUCH OF OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM IS. IT RUNS ON PROFIT. NOT NECESSARILY HOSPITALS BUT CERTAINLY PHYSICIAN GROUPS. AND CERTAINLY MOST OF OUR HEALTH INSURERS AS WELL. THINK WE FOCUS A LOT ON SORT OF THE INSURANCE ASPECTS OF ADMINISTRATION SO THAT'S THINGS LIKE BILLING. CLAIMS PAYMENT. AND OTHER INSURANCE RELATED COSTS. THERE CERTAINLY IN A COMPETITIVE COMMERCIAL SYSTEM A LOT OF MARKETING. AND IT'S NOT JUST INSURERS IT CERTAINLY HOSPITALS AND PHYSICIAN GROUPS AS WELL. AND OTHERS PARTS OF OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS THAT I THINK WE WOULDN'T NECESSARILY. DEPENDING ON YOUR PERSPECTIVE THINK OF AS AS KIND OF WASTE. AND THAT'S CARE MANAGEMENT AND CLINICAL ADMINISTRATION I MEAN YOU KNOW HOSPITALS INSURANCE COMPANIES ARE BIG ORGANIZATIONS AND IT REQUIRES SOME AMOUNT OF ADMINISTRATION TO TO MAKE THEM FUNCTION. YOU KNOW WE TALK A LOT ABOUT THE DIFFERENT SECTORS OF OF HEALTH INSURANCE AND HEALTH COVERAGE IN CHURN AMONG THOSE SECTORS. AND SORT OF DETERMINING ELIGIBILITY AND MANAGING THE ENROLLMENT. IS. IF YOU TO PRINT REQUIRES ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AND INDUCTANCE DEVEN INCLUDE THINGS LIKE AYE HR DEPARTMENTS IN EMPLOYERS THAT HAVE TO MANAGE THE HEALTH BENEFITS. FOR THEIR WORKERS. AND THEN THERE IS THE THE GOVERNMENT. GOVERNMENT ADMINISTRATION YOU KNOW RUNNING MEDICARE MEDICAID AGENCIES RUNNING RUNNING MEDICARE IT CETERA. SO FOR PUT SOME NUMBERS ON THE S. ASSUR FOCUSING FIRST ON ON HEALTH INSURANCE. AND. YOU KNOW FIRST THING TO KNOW IS THAT THE ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH HEALTH INSURANCE HAVE INCREASED DRAMATICALLY. OVER OVER RECENT DECADES. ESSENTIALLY DOUBLING FROM THREE AND A HALF PERCENT OF TOTAL HEALTH CARE. SPENDING TO A SEVEN POINT NINE PERCENT OF OF HEALTHCARE SPENDING. BUT IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO LOOK AT THE AT HOW THAT VARIES TREMENDOUSLY FROM ONE SECTOR TO ANOTHER. SO IF WE LOOK AT MEDICARE. IN REALLY HERE WE'RETALKING ABOUT TRADITIONAL FEE FOR SERVICE POINT FOUR PERCENT. OF OF TOTAL HEALTH SPENDING IN IN MEDICARE. NOW IT'S A LITTLE MISLEADING. GIVEN HOW THE CURRENT MEDICARE SYSTEM IS RUN. WHERE A LOT OF PEOPLE NOW AND ROLE IN PRIVATE PLANS THROUGH MEDICARE ADVANTAGE OR PART D.? PRIVATE INSURANCE PLANS FOR DRUGS. IF YOU INCLUDE THE ADMINISTRATIVE OVERHEAD IN THOSE INSURANCE PLANS THE CONTRACT WITH MEDICARE. IN MINISTRY OF COSTS REPRESENT SEVEN PERCENT. OF OF TOTAL HEALTH SPENDING. NOW MEDICAID EVEN AS A PUBLIC SYSTEM. ALSO CONTRACTS PRIMARILY WITH PRIVATE INSURERS. TO DELIVER. MEDI CAL BENEFITS OR MEDICAID BENEFITS YEAH IN OTHER STATES. PARTICULARLY FOR WOMEN. AND. IN ADULTS AND CHILDREN. IN SO OVERALL ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS AND MEDICAID ARE TEN POINT SEVEN PERCENT OF HEALTH SPENDING IF YOU INCLUDE THE OVERHEAD. IN THOSE INSURERS THAT MEDICAID CONTRACTS WITH. AND CERTAINLY PRIVATE INSURANCE NOT SURPRISINGLY. IS THE. IS THIS IS THE. HAS THE HIGHEST OVERHEAD MANY SECTOR AT ELEVEN POINT FIVE PERCENT ON AVERAGE. THOUGH EVEN THAT VARIES TREMENDOUSLY. YOU KNOW A LARGE EMPLOYER WITH A A LARGE GROUP. THAT SELF INSURED. MIGHT BE QUITE A BIT LOWER THAN THAT. INDIVIDUAL INSURANCE WHICH HAS HIGHER MARKETING COSTS HIGHER ENROLLMENT COST I WILL GENERALLY BE HIGHER THAN THAT. ROUGHLY IN THE RANGE OF OF TWENTY PERCENT. AND DON'T KNOW IF FOCUSING ON. ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS INSURERS THE FOR THE CHARACTER ACTUALLY DID I TOOK STEPS TO TRY AND. TRYING REDUCE THESE COSTS. BY SETTING AYE AYE CAPTAIN WHAT'S KNOWN AS THE MEDICAL LOSS RATIO AND THAT'S THE RATIO OF. HEALTHCARE EXPENSES THAT AN INSURER PAYS OR CLAIMS. TO THE OVERALL PREMIUMS THAT ENSURE TAKES TAKES SEN. THAT THIS APPLIES TO INDIVIDUALS AND. INSURED GROUPS PRIMARILY SMALL GROUPS BECAUSE SELF INSURED EMPLOYERS DON'T. YOU KNOW DON'T CONTRACT. DON'T BUY INSURANCE FROM AN INSURER. AND. IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT THIS INCLUDES SAID SAID THE. THE. RECEDED MINISTRY TO PART OF IT CERTAINLY INCLUDES WHAT WE THINK OF AS AS CLAIMS PAYMENT MARKETING. BROKER COMMISSIONS PROFITS. THE. THE DEFINITIONS IN THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT ALSO INCLUDED. WINNER KNOWN AS QUALITY ENHANCEMENT EXPENSES AS PART OF OF THE HEALTH CARE PORTION OF THE RATIO SO SO ANYTHING ENSURE DOES OR NUMBER OF THINGS AN INSURER CAN DO TO IMPROVE QUALITY. ACCOUNT AS AS. AS HEALTH CARE EXPENSES RATHER THAN THAN OVERHEAD. NOW IN GENERAL THAT LOSS RATIO RULES IN THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT WHICH REQUIRED. INDIVIDUAL AND SMALL BUSINESS INSURERS TO SPEND AT LEAST EIGHTY PERCENT OF THEIR PREMIUM REVENUES ON ON CARE OR QUALITY IMPROVEMENT. HAVE NOT BEEN REALLY CONSTRAINING. AND THAT'S PARTLY BECAUSE. IN IN MANY STATES INSURERS HAVE BEEN LOSING MONEY SO. SO SO THAT THE LOS RICH YOU'RE HAVING COME INTO PLACE THAT HAS NOT BEEN TRUE IN CALIFORNIA. AND HAS NOT BEEN TRUE IN THE LAST YEAR WHERE MOST INSURERS ARE ACTUALLY MAKING MONEY ON THIS MARKET. BUT THE MARKET'S BEEN VERY PRICE COMPETITIVE. AND HAS DRIVEN PREMIUMS. DOWN AND THE LOSS RATIOS UP. BUT IT HAS HAD AN EFFECT. YEAH INDIVIDUALS AND SMALL BUSINESSES HAVE GOTTEN A SUBSTANTIAL REBATES WHERE INSURERS. I DON'T MEET THE LOSS RATIO BUT. MOST OF THE RESEARCH SUGGESTS THAT. ABOUT TWENTY TO TWENTY FIVE CENTS OF EVERY DOLLAR IN HOSPITALS AND AND PHYSICIAN GROUPS. GOES TOWARDS ADMINISTRATION. NOW REMEMBER THIS ADMINISTRATION IS NOT JUST. YOU KNOW. DEALING WITH INSURANCE COMPANIES IT'S ALSO. MANAGING THE CLINICAL ENTERPRISE YOU KNOW MANAGING THAT DOCTORS AND. AS. MANY OF SNOW DOCTORS IN YEAH I CAN BE DIFFICULT MANAGE SOMETIMES. THE. SERVE IN IF YOU CAN BREAK THAT DOWN IN IN THIS IS BASED ON WORK DATA JIM CON FROM UCSF AND. RICK CHRONIC FROM UC SAN DIEGO DID A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO BUT IT'S STILL A PRETTY RELEVANT AYE IF YOU LOOK AT THE TOTAL ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS IN CALIFORNIA HOSPITALS. IT'S ABOUT TWENTY ONE PERCENT. OF TOTAL COSTS BUT IF YOU FOCUS ON JUST THE KIND OF BILLING AND INSURANCE RELATED COSTS. THAT MIGHT BE A TARGET OF A OF A. HEALTH REFORM. APPROACH. THAT TOTAL SIX POINT SIX TO TEN POINT EIGHT PERCENT SOCIALIST STILL SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT. BUT NOT MOST OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS. IN A HOSPITAL AND IT'S A VERY SIMILAR STORY WITH. WITH PHYSICIAN GROUPS WHERE TOTAL ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS ARE TWENTY SIX POINT SEVEN PERCENT. IN BILLING INSURANCE RELATED COSTS ARE THIRTEEN POINT NINE PERCENT. NOW I'M NO ANOTHER WAY TO THINK ABOUT THIS IS COMPARING. THE U. S. TO ANOTHER COUNTRY LIKE STEM THAT REDUCE THIS KIND OF BUILDING AN INSURANCE OVERHEAD. YOU COULD REDUCE STATE NOT JUST ADMINISTERED COSTS INSURANCE COMPANIES BUT THE ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS IN PHYSICIAN GROUPS AND HOSPITAL SUBSTANTIALLY AS AS WELL. NOW. JUST TO CONCLUDE ANYTHING THINKING ABOUT HOW THAT MIGHT HAPPEN. THEIR NUMBER OF POLICY DESIGN QUESTIONS THAT WOULD INFLUENCE. HOW MUCH ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS COULD BE REDUCED IN IN A HEALTHCARE REFORM PLAN? YOU KNOW ONE IS HOW MUCH COST SHARING PATIENTS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR. SOME SINGLE PAYER PLANS CALL FOR THE COMPLETE ELIMINATION OF PATIENT COST SHARING. IN THAT WOULD CERTAINLY CREATE A MUCH SIMPLER MUCH. LESS ADMINISTRATIVELY COMPLEX SYSTEM. IT ALSO IS MORE EXPENSIVE. IF YOU WERE TO ELIMINATE ALL ALL PATIENT CARSHARING. IN MOST COUNTRIES HAVE NOT DONE THAT. NONE SECOND IS IS THERE STILL A NEED FOR ELIGIBILITY SYSTEMS TO DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN HIGH INCOME AND LOW INCOME PEOPLE. SO FOR EXAMPLE IS IT A SYSTEM WHERE LOW INCOME PEOPLE GET ENHANCED BENEFITS OR LOWER DEDUCTIBLES. IN WHICH CASE YOU HAVE TO HAVE SOME KIND OF ELIGIBILITY APPARATUS. TO DO THAT AND THAT TAKES A ADMINISTRATIVE. ADMINISTRATIVE EFFORT. HE NO WE WE WE WE THINK OF. A SINGLE PAYER SYSTEM IS BEING MUCH SIMPLER AND IT CERTAINLY IS. BUT IT IS STILL A PAIR OF HEALTH CARE MINUTE WILL STILL BE UNDER PRESSURE TO CONTROL COSTS. AND OME OF THAT PRESSURE FOR CONTROL MAY INVOLVE. PUTTING AT PUTTING IN PLACE PAYMENT SYSTEMS THAT THAT LAUREN AND AARON TALKED ABOUT. PUTTING IN PLACE PRIOR AUTHORIZATION YOU KNOW FOR HOSPITALIZATIONS OR OR SPECIALTY CARE. IN THAT AGAIN ALL TAKES ADMINISTRATIVE OVERHEAD SO SOME OF THAT ADMINISTRATIVE OVERHEAD THAT INSURERS ARE NOW SPENDING MIGHT TRANSLATE TO A A PUBLIC PLAN. ARM AS WELL. IN AND FINALLY JUST HOW COMPLEX. THAT THE SYSTEM IS AND AND I WOULD DO THAT. CONCLUDE BY LEAVING YOU WITH THAT. SORT OF A SUGGESTED GOAL WHICH. FOR ALL OF THIS WHICH I THINK IS SIMPLICITY. YOU KNOW WE WE HEALTHCARE EXPERTS I HAVE A KNACK FOR MAKING THINGS. COMPLICATED. HOME AND. IN CERTAINLY YOU KNOW A DESIRE TO TO SATISFY COMPETING INTERESTS ARE COMPETING STAKEHOLDERS I GENERALLY INCREASES THE COMPLEXITY. OF A PROGRAM OR A PLAN. BUT YOU KNOW SELLING A HEALTH REFORM PLAN TO THE PUBLIC AND MAKING IT SUSTAINABLE. I THINK REQUIRE SOMETHING THAT'S. THAT'S MUCH SIMPLER THEN. THEN THEN WHAT WE HAVE NOW AND AND EVEN THEN THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT WHICH ITSELF IS THAT. IS QUITE COMPLEX. THANK YOU. SO UP A FEW THINGS WERE GOING TO NOW TAKE QUESTIONS TO THE DíAS I DO WANT TO BOMB NOTIFY THOSE WHO ARE HERE AND ATTENDANCE WE'RE GOING TO TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT AFTER. THIS PANEL AND A CONSUMER PANEL WHICH WILL TESTIFY FOR A TOTAL OF. TEN MINUTES. THERE ARE THREE MICROPHONES WHICH WILL BE AVAILABLE TWO OF THEM ARE HERE ON THE LOWER LEVEL AND ONE IS ON THE UPPER LEVEL SO FEEL FREE TO LINE UP IF YOU WOULD LIKE BUT WANTED TO GIVE YOU THE HEADS UP. THAT WILL BE ASKING QUESTIONS OF THIS PANEL BEFORE WE ASK QUESTIONS OF THE NEXT. WITH THAT IF THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE HERE I. QUESTIONS. HOW TO BE REALLY QUICK BECAUSE I WANT TO GO TO PUBLIC COMMENTS IS PLEASE WE CAN? FOR THOSE WHO ARE HERE AND A WEEK. MY FIRST QUITE YOU KNOW I I MEAN I'M NOT A HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONAL I'M TOOL CIVILIAN SO I'VE PRETTY MUCH LEARNED. EVERYTHING I KNOW ABOUT HEALTHCARE FROM THE LAST IN THE SERIES OF HEARINGS SO EXCUSE ME IF MY QUESTIONS ARE. REALLY ADELINE. KAISER CREDIT BECAUSE OUR HOUSE CARE MODEL WITHIN ITS LITTLE UNIVERSE IS IT IN IT IN AN OF ITSELF AS IT CONTAINS SYSTEM A SINGLE PAYER SYSTEM. KIND OF AND HOW IT OPERATES. YOU GONNA SAY NO OFFICE NO NO NOT REALLY AND. NOW SO I'M A SINGLE PAYER SYSTEM WE WOULD NORMALLY SAY IS. COMMONLY AYE TAX FINANCE GOVERNMENT RUN SYSTEM THAT PROVIDES INSURANCE TO A LARGE GROUP OF THE POPULATION HAWKEYE AND SO KINDER. I YOU KNOW IF YOU IF YOU USE THAT A LARGE DELIVERY NETWORK LIKE THAT TO PROVIDE CARE FOR A. BUNCH OF CALIFORNIA FOR EXAMPLE MAKE IT CLOSER TO IT BUT I DON'T THINK WE NORMALLY SAY KAISER IS A SINGLE PAYER SYSTEM GOT IT HAS SOME SIMILARITIES. SO IT SOUNDS LIKE THE ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS. DEALING WITH THE IN THE ADMINISTRATION THE INSURANCE. SO OF ADMINISTRATION OF THE SYSTEM NOT INTERNAL COSTS AT ANY. HEALTHCARE SYSTEM WHETHER IT'S SINGLE PAYER OR NOT HAS THE STATISTIC YOU SHOW TO THE DEFENSE IN THE U. S. AND CANADA YOU'RE LOOKING AT ABOUT TEN PERCENT DIFFERENCE. TO ADMINISTER. THAT. UP. THAT SYSTEM AS OPPOSED TO THE SYSTEMS THAT WE HAVE HERE. SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I WAS VERY INTERESTED IN LISTENING FOR YOU TOUCHED ON IT A BIT. I'M PARTICULARLY MISTER BAKER BUT ALSO MISTER LEVITT. IS OUR SYSTEM DRIVEN BY. MARKET FORCES. AS OPPOSED TO THE EUROPEAN SYSTEMS ALL OF WHICH. TAKE A LOT THAT SEEMS TO ME TAKE A LOT OF THOSE MARKET. DRIVERS OUT OF THE SYSTEM AND REPLACE THEM WITH PURE REGULATION. OR A LOT OF REGULATION SO THEY HAVE THEY HAVE HAVE AS FAR AS I UNDERSTAND IT THEY HAVE VERY HEAVILY REGULATED COST CONTAINMENT. WHERE IS OURS IS COMPLETELY MARKET DRIVEN? SO. JUST A COMMENT IT JUST IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THE DIFFERENCE IN THE COST THEN BETWEEN AT TEN PERCENT THAT BUT THAT IS IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE SYSTEM. THAT IF WE WERE TO IMPLEMENT WHAT'S A SINGLE PAYER TOMORROW WITHOUT THE REST OF THE COST CONTAINMENT WE'RE REALLY LOOKING AT SAVING TEN PERCENT BUT WHAT THE DIFFERENCES IS THAT THEY ARE. REGULATING ACROSS THEIR ENTIRE SYSTEM. SO THEY'RE SAYING WE'RE GOING ON NOT ALLOW THE MARKET WHETHER IT'S HOSPITALS DOCTORS INSURANCE COMPANIES ANYONE PHARMACEUTICALS. ANY COMPANY OR PERSON WHO TOUCHES HEALTHCARE. WE'RE GOING TO REGULATE THE PROFITS OR IF THE PAYMENT PERIOD. AND THAT'S WHERE THEY'RE GETTING THE BULK OF THEIR COST SAVINGS. SO SINGLE PAYER. ITS ELEGANT IT'S OF. EFFICIENT. BUT HE DOESN'T GET YOU THERE WE'VE GOT TO TAKE A REALLY GOING TO BE SERIOUS ABOUT CONTROLLING COSTS. WE HAVE TO TAKE THE. THE WE CAN'T ALLOW THE FREE MARKET ANY LONGER WITH ITS CONSOLIDATIONS AND ITS LACK OF BALANCE IN TERMS OF BEING ABLE TO CONTROL THOSE COSTS. WE AS THE GOVERNMENT. ARE THE ONLY ONES IN THE POSITION OF ACTUALLY TAKING ALL OF THOSE UNREGULATED PROFITS. THAT ARE RIGHT WE HAVE BEEN DRIVING THOSE COSTS UP AND UP AND UP. OUT OF THE SYSTEM. RIGHT. I MEAN IS I AM I AM SORT OF HEARING. NO I WOULD SAY THERE THERE ARE COMPARING THE U. S. SYSTEM TO TO. INTERNET OTHER HIGH INCOME COUNTRIES THERE REALLY TO. TO TWO SOURCES OF OF SAVINGS WHEN HIS ADMINISTRATION. WHICH WE TALKED ABOUT EVEN THAT THAT CANADIAN EXAMPLE IS JUST HOSPITALS SO THAT'S ACTUALLY JUST A PIECE. A PIECE OF IT YOU WOULD ALSO SEE SAVINGS AND. IN HEALTH INSURANCE KNOW ADMINISTRATION. AND AND PROFIT. THE OTHER THE OTHER. AS YOU SUGGESTED IS IT'S IT'S PRICES GENERALLY THAT THAT EVERY OTHER SYSTEM. CARVES OUT A GREATER ROLE FOR GOVERNMENT. IN IN REGULATING PRICES. MANY VARIES FROM ONE SYSTEM TO ANOTHER. HOW IT'S DONE? AND HOW COMPREHENSIVE IT IS BUT I I WOULD SAY EVERY OTHER. HIGH INCOME COUNTRIES REGULATES. PRICES. IN ONE ONE WAY OR OR ANOTHER. NOW THERE IS A SOURCE OF THOSE ARE TWO SOURCES OF SAVINGS. FROM MOVING TO A. SINGLE PAYER OR TAX FINANCE SYSTEM. I MEAN THERE IS A SOURCE OF COSTS TO OBVIOUSLY. YOU KNOW COVERING. YOU KNOW WE DON'T PROVIDE UNIVERSAL COVERAGE SO COVERING AS ADDITIONAL PEOPLE. PARTICULARLY COVERING THEM AT LOWER COST PATIENT CARSHARING. WOULD COST MONEY SO KIND OF THE CALCULATION IS HOW MUCH COULD YOU SAVE. ON THE BY REDUCING ADMINISTRATION REDUCING PRICES AND THEN HOW MUCH WOULD IT COST IN ORDER TO BRING EVERYONE INTO THE SYSTEM. RIGHT SO ON. I MEAN YOU KNOW THAT THAT SHOWS THE KIND OF THE. TO REALLY BRING THE THE TRUE. COST SAVINGS THAT WE WOULD NEED TO DO WE WANT TO DO IS GOING TO TAKE OF OBVIOUSLY A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF CHANGE YOU TALKED ABOUT THE DISRUPTIVE EFFECT AND. OVER LEVEL OF REGULATION THAT WE CERTAINLY HAVE NEVER HAD WITH HEALTHCARE IN THIS COUNTRY THAT I KNOW OF. UP IT'S YOU KNOW IT'S JUST. YOU KNOW WE WE LOOK AT ALL THESE OTHER COUNTRIES THAT ARE HAVING AT LEAST EQUAL IF NOT BETTER HEALTHCARE RESULTS. WITH THE REGULATION AND. YOU KNOW SEEM TO HAVE GOTTEN UNDER CONTROL WHAT SEEMS TO BE EVEN WITH A CA. A AN UNRAVELING SYSTEM. WITH COSTS REALLY SPIRALING A LOT HE HAS REALLY ACROSS THE COUNTRY MAYBE LESS IN CALIFORNIA AND WE DO HAVE COST CONTAINMENT RIGHT IN MEDICAID MEDI CAL AND THE VA SYSTEM. DOES HAVE A LOT YOU KNOW APPEAR GOVERNMENT CONTROL OF THOSE COSTS AND WE SEE NOSY SHOWN LOWER COSTS. LOOKS LIKE PRETTY GOOD DELIVERY OF OF CARE YOU KNOW THAT DOCTORS MAYBE AREN'T HAPPY WITH THE REIMBURSEMENT RATES. IN HOSPITALS BUT BUT FUNCTIONING. SO. THAT'S SORT OF MY TAKE AWAY HERE BUT IF I'M MISSING BIG PIECES ARE. YOU KNOW I'D. YEAH. FILL ME IN. NOW THIS OUT ADD A LITTLE BIT TO SO WHAT LARRY SAID I THINK BIG THE KEY IS WHO'S GONNA PUSH BACK INTO THERE ARE LOT OF THINGS PUSHING PRICES UP. THERE'S A LOT OF. WELL WE TALKED A LOT ABOUT A LOT OF THEM IN THE US HAS BUILT A VERY DIFFUSE. SET OF FOLKS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE TABLE THAT HAVEN'T GOTTEN THEIR ACT TOGETHER IN THE WAY THAT SOME THE EUROPEAN SYSTEMS BY ONE MECHANISM OR ANOTHER MORE GOVERNMENT MORE EMPOWERED. OTHER PROVIDERS HOW ARE THERE INSURERS HOWEVER YOU DO IT AYE HAS BEEN ABLE TO PUSH BACK THAT CREATES THEN THAT WOULD CREATE THEN ATTENTION TO CREATE SOME SOME. OF PRESSURE IN THE US FOR LOWER PRICES TO THE EXTENT OF PRICES ARE HIGHER THAN THEY HAVE TO BE TO DELIVER SERVICES. IT WOULD ALSO PUT PRESSURE ON OTHER. ASPECTS OF OUR DELIVERY SYSTEM IT MIGHT MEAN DIFFERENT KINDS OF HOSPITALS IT MIGHT BE DIFFERENT SERVICES AVAILABLE IT MIGHT MEAN DIFFERENT KINDS OF DOCTORS IN THE SYSTEM IN THE LONG RUN. MAYBE THAT WOULD BE GOOD FOR US A BUT IT WOULD ENTAIL SOME CHANGE TO THAT PUSH BACK WOULD CREATE A LOT OF THAT TENSION IN THE DISCUSSION ABOUT WHAT OUR SYSTEM IS GOING TO LOOK LIKE. IN THE FUTURE IT WOULD MAKE A DISCUSSION ABOUT LOWER COSTS BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN HEALTHCARE DELIVERY AND WHO'S DELIVERING IT HOW MUCH WE'RE PAYING THEM. THOSE DISK DOES DISCUSSIONS WHAT HAPPENED IN THE CONTEXT OF THAT'S I THINK THAT'S THE OTHER THING THAT'S HAPPENED IN THOSE IN THOSE OTHER SYSTEMS. IS THEY'VE HAD MANY YEARS OF THOSE DISCUSSIONS WE WOULD HAVE TO START THEM FRESH THEY BE DIFFICULT TO DO. AYE BUT THEY WOULD THAT WOULD SORT OF PUSH US IN THAT DIRECTION AS YOU SEE. ASSEMBLYMEMBER WALDRON. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR ARM OF THIS CqC AS I CAN. BEING ABLE TO TALK ABOUT THE ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS IS IN A SOMETHING I'VE BEEN LOOKING FORWARD TO HOLY THROUGH ALL THESE HEARINGS. MY BROTHER IS A PHYSICIAN IN NEW YORK AND HE HAS TO BASICALLY COVER THE COST OF ABOUT NINETY FIVE TWO HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND A YEAR. JUST DEALING WITH PLAN THE NILES AND PAPERWORK. APPEALS. SO HAD THEY HAVE THEM IN THE OFFICE SPACE STAFF TO HANDLE IT. A FULL TIME JOB. WHAT THEY GET IS IN NO RESPONSE OF OLD THEY'VE LOST THE PAPERWORK THEN THEY HAVE TO RESCIND THE NAME RECESS I MEAN? YOU KNOW IT'S A CONSTANT PROBLEM MEANWHILE THE PATIENCE WAITING THE PATIENT IS IN NO. LOST IN THE SHUFFLE LITERALLY I'M. THEM WE LOOK AT OTHER THINGS LIKE EVIDENCE BASED CARE VERSUS THE UNNECESSARY TREATMENTS AND EXTRA TESTS BECAUSE PEOPLE AFRAID OF GETTING SUED. ON IN THOSE IS HOLD A LEVEL BEYOND JUST I CARE IN YOU KNOW HOW WE HOW WE TRYING TO DO WITH ACCESS. FOR EXAMPLE MY MOTHER LOVES EIGHTY THREE CURRENTLY BUT SHE HAS A BACK INJURY. IT TOOK THREE DOCTORS TO FINALLY GET A REFERRAL TO SO SHE CAN GET AN EPIDURAL BUT IN THE MEANTIME SHOULD BE CLEARED BY AN NEUROLOGISTS WHO WAS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT IF SHE HAD DEMENTIA. AND SHE'S EIGHTY THREE SHE GETS UPSET SHE DOESN'T CLEARLY OF DEMENTIA BUT THEY HAVE TO GO THROUGH ALL THESE OTHER THINGS BEFORE THEY FINALLY GIVEN UP ADORO AND IS JUST UNNECESSARY UNNECESSARY UNNECESSARY. YOU OF PHYSICIANS WHO WERE STARING AT A SCREEN AND I KNOW BECAUSE I BRING MY SON IN FOR HIS. REGULAR YOU KNOW CHECK OF EVERY YEAR THEY SERVE THE SWING THE NOT LOOKING AT THE PATIENT WHAT THEY USE TO THERE'S JUST SO MUCH PAPERWORK. SO MUCH BUREAUCRACY THAT WE WE HAVE NO MATTER WHAT WE DO WE HAVE TO CUT THAT AND YOU KNOW I'M. I I'M GLAD THAT THIS WAS BROACH THAT THE HEARING HAS IT'S BEEN ONE OF MY FRUSTRATIONS OVER WAY THROUGH. YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW WHAT WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO ABOUT. THOSE THAT PAPERWORK SHUFFLE BUT OKAY. REALLY QUICKLY I'M THE OTHER ISSUE IS. THIS. HOW CURRENTLY WAS SET UP WHEN WE HAVE A PATIENT COMING IN FOR TREATMENT? IF WE HAVE PATIENT A THEY COMMAND. PRESENTING WITH THE WHATEVER THAT THEY. DISEASE IS. THEY'RE TOLD THEY NEED TO JUST STEP THERAPY AND THEY FAIL. THEN THE COMEBACK STEP THERAPY AND THEY FAIL. MEANWHILE THE PHYSICIAN ALREADY KNOWS WHAT THEY WANT THEY'VE GONE THROUGH YOU KNOW GETTING DENIED. WITHIN THE YEAR THE BUDGET YEAR THE PATIENT WILL HOPEFULLY GET WHAT THE PHYSICIAN WANTED IN THE BEGINNING. BUT MEANWHILE WHERE QUALITY OF LIFE WAS LESS IF IT'S A COMMUNICABLE DISEASE THERE'S YOU KNOW THE VIRAL LOAD ISSUE IN THE COMMUNITY THERE'S HOSPITALIZATION COSTS. GETTING A HANDLE ON WHAT'S. STEPPED THIRD BE FAILURES R. IS IMPOSSIBLE I'VE TRIED TO THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES AND OTHERS TO FIND OUT WHAT IS A COST. PER PATIENT. FOR EACH OF FAILURE OF THE STEP THERAPY. THAT'S A COSTS THOUGH IT'S A AND IT'S OF THE WHOLE BUREAUCRACY. IN ADDITION IT UP WE IF WE LOOK TOWARD INDIVIDUALIZED MEDICINE OR VALUE ADDED HEALTH CARE AND THAT'S WHAT I HOPE CAN BE PART OF THIS DISCUSSION. THERE'S SOME IS THERE AND THIS IS THE QUESTION IS THERE SOME TRUTH. TO THE IDEA OF GETTING THE BEST CARE UP FRONT. REALIZE SAVINGS IN THE LONG RUN. ISN'T IT PART OF THIS EQUATION. YEAH MAN I THINK ONE OF THE CHALLENGES WOULD THE FRAGMENTED SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE TODAY IS THAT IF THERE ARE KIND OF LONG RUN DOWNSTREAM BENEFITS. THOSE IN A MAY ACCRUE NOT TO THE KIND OF PAYER THAT HAS TO MAKE THE INVESTMENTS UP FRONT RIGHT AND SO IF YOU IMAGINE SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO REDUCE YOUR COST OF CARE WHEN YOU'RE SEVENTY THAT'S A BENEFIT THAT ACCRUES TO. YOU AS A MEDICARE PATIENT BUT IF THAT REQUIRES TREATMENT AT THE AGE OF FIFTY THAT'S A COST THAT OCCURS TO YOUR YOUR CURRENT HEALTH PLAN WHICH IS NOT. GENERALLY THE MEDICARE PROGRAM MADE AND SO THERE IS CERTAINLY SOME. HAD A MISALIGNMENT OF THE TIMING OF THE KIND OF FINANCING OR FUNDING OF HEALTHCARE AND THE POTENTIAL DOWNSTREAM BENEFITS THAT CREATES THESE. AYE DIFFERENCES IN INCENTIVES THAT YOU MENTIONED AND I THINK YOU KNOW THAT'S THAT'S KIND OF A. UNFORTUNATE COMPONENT OF THE WAY THAT THAT THIS SYSTEM IS CURRENTLY STRUCTURED THAT DOES SOME OF THE FINANCIAL INCENTIVES ARE NOT IN PLACE TO INVEST IN IN LONG TERM. IN CARE THAT HAS LONG TERM BENEFITS I'M AT LEAST FROM THE FINANCIAL PERSPECTIVE OF INSURERS. THE MORE CHURN YOU HAVE AN ASSIST. YOU KNOW THE THE MORE THAT THAT PROBLEM GETS EXACERBATED AS WELL. EXACTLY IF PEOPLE AREN'T STAYING ON A PLAN. LONG ENOUGH LONG TERM THEN THEY KNOW THAT THEY DON'T HAVE TO COVER THEM OVER TIME WHEN THAT. IN A LIVER TRANSPLANT OR WHATEVER HITS. AND THAT'S AN ISSUE AND I FEEL LIKE WE REALLY NEED TO ADDRESS IT BECAUSE IN THE END THIS THE PATIENTS A FALLING THROUGH THE CRACKS AND SUFFERING. AND THEN JUST REALLY QUICKLY THE LAST THING IS WHERE DOES INNOVATION FALL ANALYSTS. IF WE COULD HAVE YOU KNOW. THE NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND DATA DRIVEN CARE OF THE ONLY THINGS THAT WE KEEP HEARING ABOUT TALKING ABOUT. WE'RE GOING TO LOSE THAT NO MATTER WHAT SYSTEM WE END UP WITH. THIS I THINK IT'LL CREATE COST SAVINGS IN THE LONG RUN. THANK YOU. WITHOUT AMOUNTS TO REALLY COOK QUESTIONS IF I CAN FIRST DR TRISH. IF CALIFORNIA WERE TO MOVE TO A SINGLE PAYER OR TO AND ALL PAYER RATE SETTING SYSTEM. DO WE CURRENTLY HAVE ENOUGH INFORMATION IN THE COST REPORTS AND DISCHARGE DATA FILED ITH THE HARSH PAD. TO EFFECTIVELY NEGOTIATE HOSPITAL BUDGET AND SET PROVIDER RATE PAYMENT. RATES. AND WHAT DATA AND CONSIDERATIONS SHOULD WE BE LOOKING AT TO HELP MANAGE YOUR TWO YEAR INFLATION. AS WELL AS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T HAVE ABRUPT DISRUPTIONS IN INCOME FOR PROVIDERS. SO THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION I MEAN I THINK THERE MAY BE DIFFERENT DATA SOURCES THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO YOU KIND OF THE STATE OR STATE GOVERNMENTS BUT AT LEAST FROM A RESEARCHERS PERSPECTIVE I WOULD SAY WE DON'T HAVE THE ADEQUATE DATA TO FULLY. KINDA COMPREHENSIVELY UNDERSTAND WHAT HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS ARE GETTING PAID ACROSS THE FULL SPECTRUM OF DIFFERENT PAYERS AND OF DIFFERENT COMMERCIAL PLANS YOU KNOW IN PARTICULAR IN THE CASE OF. OTHER COMMERCIAL INSURERS. THESE NEGOTIATED RATES ARE CONSIDERED KIND OF PROPRIETARY. YOU KNOW INFORMATION OR PROPRIETARY RATES AND SO THERE ARE SOME DATA SOURCES AVAILABLE BUT THEY'RE NOT COMPREHENSIVE IN IN THE HARSH THE OSCAR DATA IS A GREAT SOURCE OF INFORMATION ON. KENNY UTILIZATION OF IN PATIENT AND EDIE CARE BUT YOU CAN HAVE TO TO ESTIMATE THE PAYMENTS THAT HOSPITALS GET PAID THE ACTUAL DATA IS NOT INCLUDED IN IN THAT DATA SAID. AND I THINK YOU KNOW IT THIS. THIS IS NOT A. STRAIGHTFORWARD SIMPLE ANSWER AND THAT THERE'S A LOT OF POTENTIAL DOWNSTREAM IMPLICATIONS OF AND OF WORKFORCE CONSIDERATIONS AND ACCESS AND I I THINK THAT. MORE BROADLY MAKING AVAILABLE ON DATA TO STUDY THESE TYPES OF QUESTIONS YOU KNOW THERE ARE SOME GREAT. ECONOMISTS OUT THERE THERE ARE SOME GREAT MODELERS OF KIND OF PREDICTING FUTURE PROVIDER BEHAVIOR OF PREDICTING CONSUMER BEHAVIOR ALL OF THOSE THINGS AND SO. BETTER DATA AND SOME KIND OF INVESTMENT IN ANALYTICS CAN CERTAINLY YOU KNOW INFORM THESE TYPES OF A DECISIONS AND SETTING RATES. SO OFFLINE I'D LIKE IF YOU COULD TO HELP MY OFFICE FIGURE OUT WHAT THOSE DATA POINTS ARE SO THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY WORK ON THAT BUT WANT TO DO IT. AT A TIME WHEN WE HAVE MORE IF OKAY GREAT THANK YOU IF I CAN ASK DOCTOR BAKER TO WHAT EXTENT CAN EXISTING ANTI TRUST LAWS BE USED SUCCESSFULLY TO COMBAT. THE ANTI COMPETITIVE EFFECTS OF CONSOLIDATION AND WHAT CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT THE ROLE OF STATE PURSES FEDERAL LAW AND POLICY IN ACCOMPLISHING THIS GOAL. AB AND IT SHORT ANSWERS BE INCOMPLETE IN SOME SENSE SO I'M. FEDERAL LAWS CAN BE HELPFUL THE PROBLEMS. SOME OF THE PROBLEMS AT THE MOMENT DISTINCT INCLUDE THAT SHEER NUMBER OF MERGERS AN ACTIVITY THAT THE FTC IN THE DOJ TRY TO MONITOR. AND SO. TO SOME EXTENT STATES TAKING AN INTEREST IN THEIR OWN CONCERNS MAY BE USEFUL BECAUSE THEY JUST DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES TO LOOK AT EVERYTHING THAT'S OUT THEIR EVEN THOUGH THE LAW MIGHT ALLOW THEM TO TAKE ON SOME OF THESE ISSUES. ARE THERE ARE THERE ARE DEFICIENCIES IN THE CURRENT LAWS ESPECIALLY AS THEY. AS THEY RELATE TO PHYSICIANS I THINK SO I ONE OF THE ISSUES IS JUST THIS THE. THE DEFINITION OF A REVIEWABLE EVENT I HAVE TO REACH A CERTAIN SCALAR CERTAIN SIZE TO BE SUBJECT TO THE LAWS AND SO IF YOU I'M. ARE A LARGE. PROVIDER GROUP AND YOU START MERGING WITH A COUPLE OF SMALL ONE OR TWO PERSON PRACTICES OFTEN THOSE TRANSACTIONS ARE NOT REVIEWABLE. UNDER THE CURRENT LAWS AND SO THERE ARE SOME SOME ISSUES WITH THE EXTENT TO WHICH WE CAN USE THE CURRENT STRUCTURE TO HANDLE SOME OF THE CONSOLIDATION THAT'S BEEN GOING ON. I'M YOUR SECOND QUESTION I THINK IS WHAT CAN ASSIST WHAT WERE THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN STATE AND FEDERAL LIVE I THINK THAT IS AN INTERESTING. AYE ISSUE I'M NOT A. LAWYER AN ANTITRUST LEGAL SCHOLAR CELLS TRY TO STEER CLEAR OF GIVING YOU REALLY DETAILED LEGAL ADVICE ON THIS MATTER. BUT I THINK THERE ARE THIS THE STATE CERTAINLY. HAS A LICENSING ISSUE PLACE AND SING AND OTHER COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS OF HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS AND THAT PROBABLY GIVES IT SOME ABILITY TO LOOK AT WHO'S MERGING AND WORKING TOGETHER. THERE MAY BE OTHER THINGS THAT STATES CAN DO AND I'LL I'LL JUST NOT TRY TO SAY ABOUT MY NOTE IT'S A CHALLENGING ISSUE. BUT THERE ARE STATES MASSACHUSETTS FOR EXAMPLE HAS TAKEN A GREAT INTEREST IN THE ISSUES AND IN THE ACTIVITIES OF OF PROVIDERS IN THEIR STATE AND MANAGED TO DO IT SO I THINK THERE ARE WAYS FOR STATES TO DO IT. IT MAY BE. PARALLEL TO ARE DIFFERENT THAN JUST DO THE STANDARD ANTI TRUST LAWS. THANK YOU. WITHOUT I WANTED TO THANK THIS PANEL FOR. YOUR PRESENTATIONS AND AGAIN YOUR EXPERTISE. I'D LIKE TO CALL OUR CONSUMER PANELISTS UP NEXT. GEN FLORIAN BETSY SOME HOLES THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY A COMMENT THE WORK OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE COULD NOT BE MORE TIMELY AND IMPORTANT. A NATIONALLY REPRESENTATIVE SURVEY BY CONSUMER REPORTS LAST YEAR AFFECT INTRODUCED MYSELF BETSY EMOTES FROM CONSUMERS UNION THE POLICY AND ADVOCACY ARM OF CONSUMER REPORTS. A NATIONALLY REPRESENTATIVE SURVEY DONE BY CONSUMER REPORTS LAST YEAR FOUND THAT HEALTH CARE REMAINS THE TOP AND A GROWING CONSUMER CONCERN OF ALL THE SUBJECT AREAS WE STUDIED. ONE KEY FINDING WAS THAT MORE THAN HALF OF RESPONDENTS NATIONALLY SAID THEY LACK CONFIDENCE THAT THEY OR THEIR LOVED ONES WILL BE ABLE TO AFFORD HEALTH INSURANCE IN THE FUTURE. DESPITE THE PUBLIC CONFUSION CREATED BY SOME. FEDERAL ACTORS IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE FACT IS THAT WE HAVE MADE HUGE STRIDES. UP NATIONALLY ON BROADENING ACCESS TO COVERAGE UNDER THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT INTO THE MEDICAID EXPANSION AND OF COURSE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND PARTICULARLY STANDS OUT AMONG THE STATE'S FOR ALL THE PROGRESS THAT WE'VE MADE HERE. YES WE'VE HEARD ALL DAY LONG. CHALLENGES CERTAINLY REMAIN AND I'VE BEEN ASKED TO DISCUSS A COUPLE OF THESE CHALLENGES FROM THE CONSUMER PERSPECTIVE SUCH A CHUNK THREE TODAY WE'RE GONNA KEEP IT REALLY BRIEF BECAUSE I KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF FOLKS WANNA GET THEIR COMMENTS. FIRST JUST TO PRICES A CONSUMERS PAY AND COST TO THE SYSTEM. CONSUMER CONCERNS ABOUT COST GETTING IN THE WAY OF GETTING NEEDED CARE A DIMINISHED WITH THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT YET PREMIUM INCREASES. AND RISING DEDUCTIBLES DO PRESENT BARRIERS THAT MAKE COST OF COVERAGE AND CARE UNAFFORDABLE FOR SOME CALIFORNIANS. COVERED CALIFORNIA'S MANAGED TO MODERATE PREMIUM INCREASES ON THE EXCHANGE ON AND OF COURSE THE IMPACT OF EVEN THOSE PREMIUMS HAS BEEN SOFTENED BY THE. PREMIUM TAX CREDITS THAT THE VAST MAJORITY NEARLY NINETY PERCENT OF ENROLLEES THERE RECEIVE. BUT. FOR THOSE. ABOVE THAT INCOME LEVEL FOR THE SUBSIDIES AND FOR SOME BELOW THAT LEVEL IT IS STILL A STRUGGLE TO PAY FOR HEALTH COVERAGE IN COSTS. AND OF COURSE UNDOCUMENTED CALIFORNIANS ARE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR THOSE SUBSIDIES AT ALL. THERE'S A RANGE OF WAYS CALIFORNIA CAN MAKE COVERAGE FOR THOSE WITHOUT EMPLOYER INSURANCE A AFFORDABLE AND WE URGE YOU TO EXPLORE THEM IN THE COMING YEAR. SHORT OF OUR PERHAPS GRANDEST VISION OF FOR A SIMPLIFIED A UNIVERSAL CARE SYSTEM WE ARE TO DO IN THE AYE EXPLORE ENHANCE SUBSIDIES FOR THOSE AT FOUR HUNDRED OR JUST A LITTLE OVER FOUR HUNDRED AND AS WELL AS THOSE UNDER. THAT LIMIT. OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL AND CONSIDER PERHAPS CAPPING THE MAXIMUM PERCENTAGE OF INCOME THAT ANY CONSUMER SHOULD HAVE TO PAY FOR HEALTH INSURANCE PREMIUMS IN CALIFORNIA'S TWO EXAMPLES OF THINGS TO LOOK AT. IT'S TEMPTING JUST TO FOCUS ON COST TO THE INDIVIDUAL BECAUSE THAT'S HOW WE REALLY FEEL THAT OUR FAMILIES AND OURSELVES AND OUR FRIENDS. BUT UNDERLYING SYSTEM COSTS AS WE'VE HEARD TODAY I'M ALSO CANNOT BE IGNORED. ON THOSE COSTS. CONTRIBUTE TO THE UPWARD SPIRAL BUT SPIRAL OF PREMIUMS GOVERNMENT EXPENDITURES IN THEY SUPPRESS WORKERS WAGES. IT'S WELL ESTABLISHED THAT A FOR DECADES. HEALTH EXPENDITURES IN THE UNITED STATES HAVE GROWN AT A MUCH HIGHER RATE THAN IN OTHER. INDUSTRIALIZED COUNTRIES IN EVIDENCE SHOWS THAT THE HIGH PRICES NOT GREATER UTILIZATION ARE THE PRIMARY DRIVER. US PAYS MORE THAN COMPARABLE NATIONS FOR THE SAME HEALTH CARE PROCEDURES SERVICES DRUGS AND DEVICES. AND WHILE PER CAPITA COSTS IN CALIFORNIA OR LOWER THAN THE UNITED STATES AS A WHOLE PERSONAL SPENDING IN CALIFORNIA OVER FIVE TO TEN YEARS. I'M ACTUALLY GREW FASTER THAN THE NATIONAL AVERAGE SO THE GAP BETWEEN FEDERAL AND CALIFORNIA. ON PER CAPITA SPENDING IS CLOSING BUT NOT IN A GOOD WAY IT'S ALL STILL GOING UPWARD. POLICY MAKERS HAVE OF COURSE TRIED A VARIETY. OF APPROACHES TO SQUEEZE GREATER VALUE OUT OF OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM THAT IS IMPROVE QUALITY WHILE ALSO CONTAINING COSTS. MAINLY THROUGH MARKET BASED INCENTIVES AND SOMETIMES PENALTIES. WHILE THESE STEPS HAVE TEMPERED INCREASES IN RECENT YEARS WE NEED TO DO MORE. CALIFORNIA NEEDS A FOCUSED INITIATIVE TO UNDERSTAND THE SOURCES OF RISING COSTS WITH PARTICULARITY AND TO TACKLE THEM. STEPS THAT SOME OTHER INSTEAD OF STATES HAVE TAKEN TO DO SO INCLUDE CREATION OF A COST COMMISSION. OUGHT TO ZERO IN ON MEASURING VALUE INTO YOUR I'LL COMMENT ASSEMBLYMEMBER AROUND A LOT WHEAT I THINK WE DO NOT HAVE THE DATA SO ANOTHER THING SOME STATES HAVE DONE IS TO ESTABLISH ALL PAYER. DATA BASES TO LEARN WHERE THE SPECIFIC DRIVERS LIE. AND ALSO SETTING ACTUAL CAPS ON ON GROWTH RATES. THE SECOND CHALLENGE CATEGORY I'LL JUST TOUCH ON HIS CONSUMER UNDERSTANDING IN NAVIGATION WE'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT THAT TODAY AS WELL. QUALITATIVE RESEARCH BY CONSUMERS UNION I'M OVER THE PAST FEW FEW YEARS ACTUALLY PROVE SO WE INTUITIVELY NOW CONSUMERS ARE LOST IN THE JARGON AND THE MASS OF HEALTH INSURANCE. CULTURE IN TERMS OUR COURSE THE MOST CONFUSING. AND THEY COME THEIR COMPOUNDED BY GENERAL NUMERACY PROBLEMS IN THE AMERICAN PUBLIC THE NEED TO APPLY THE TERMS AND THEN NUMERICAL OPERATIONS INTO THE MALL SEQUENTIALLY MAKES IT VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR PEOPLE TO FIGURE OUT. YOUR COSTS. AGAIN COVER CALIFORNIA'S DONE COMMENDABLE WORK TO LESSEN THESE CHALLENGES WITH STANDARDIZED CONSUMER FRIENDLY COST SHARING PLANS IN THE METAL TEARS. AND RESEARCHERS HAVE SUGGESTED THAT THESE COST SHARING OPTIONS AND ALSO A LIEU LIMITED NUMBER OF. PLAN CHOICES HELPS CONSUMERS MAKE THE BEST CHOICES FOR THEMSELVES SO. AS I THINK MR LEVITT MENTIONED EARLIER FURTHER STANDARDIZATION AND PLAN OFFERINGS DESIGNS TERMS AND DEFINITIONS WOULD WOULD BENEFIT CONSUMERS. FURTHERMORE ON. BIG MORE VIGOROUS SUSTAINED PUBLICITY IS NEEDED ON IN OUR OPINION ABOUT THE STATE REGULATORS WHO CAN HELP CONSUMERS THROUGH THE MAZE AND CAN ANSWER CONSUMER OF. PROBLEMS CAN HELP RESOLVE THOSE PROBLEMS WITH THEIR COVERAGE IN A TWENTY FIFTEEN SURVEY BY CONSUMERS UNION THAT WE DIDN'T HEAR IN CALIFORNIA. EIGHTY FIVE PERCENT OF CALIFORNIANS DID NOT KNOW OF WHO THE STATE REGULATORS WHERE THEY COULD HELP THEM WITH THEIR HEALTH INSURANCE PROBLEMS. PRETTY SHOCKING. I'M MORE OVER PLAN NETWORKS ARE AS WE'VE HEARD ALL DAY LONG NOTS NOT EASY TO UNDERSTAND. STANDARD SIGNALS OF NETWORK BREATH ARE LACKING FOR EXAMPLE BROAD NARROW ULTRA NARROW AND BUT THESE KIND OF TERMS WOULD HELP OR LABELS WOULD HELP CONSUMERS GIVE THEM CUES ABOUT THE TRADE OFFS THEY MAY BE MAKING IN CHOOSING A PLAN. AND THE THIRD POINT I JUST TOUCH ON BRIEFLY THE THIRD CATEGORY OF CHALLENGES IS THE NEED FOR GREATER EFFICIENCIES ANOTHER THING WE'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT TODAY. IN A TWENTY SIXTEEN COMMONWEALTH FUND SURVEY OF CONSUMERS EXPERIENCES AMERICANS I WILL SAY TIED WITH NORWEGIANS. UP TOP THE LIST OF RESIDENTS OF WEALTHY NATIONS FRUSTRATED WITH POOR CORPORATE CORPS CARE COORDINATION SUCH AS TEST RESULTS NOT BEING AVAILABLE AT THE TIME OF AN APPOINTMENT DUPLICATE TESTING ORDERED. LACK OF SHARED INFORMATION BETWEEN SPECIALISTS AND PRIMARY CARE DOCS AND CONFLICTING INFORMATION RECEIVED FROM DIFFERENT PROVIDERS. THERE WE'VE TALKED ALL DAY ABOUT WAYS TO IMPROVE THE EFFICIENCY ONE I'LL JUST MENTION I'M IS HEALTH INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY. AND WHICH CAN HELP IN COURT CARE COORDINATION TRACKING HEALTH QUALITY. AND SUPPORTING ACHIEVING HEALTH EQUITY. CONSUMERS VALUE THE USE OF H. I. T. ON TO TRACK THEIR TEST RESULTS COMMUNICATE WITH THEIR PROVIDERS AND EVEN CORRECT ERRONEOUS INFORMATION IN SOME CASES IN THEIR RECORDS. YET MANY IMPEDIMENTS REMAIN TO GETTING A GOOD. HEALTH. INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE AND GETTING EVERYBODY TO PARTICIPATE SO WE ARE TO DO IT AS WELL LOOK AT THAT TIME IF YOU'RE INCENTIVES THAT COULD BE. OFFERED TO ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD ADOPTION IMPROVED INTER OPERABILITY SO SYSTEMS CAN TALK TO EACH OTHER AND REALLY GET THE BENEFITS OF SHARING. AND OVERALL I JUST WANNA CLOSE AND TURNED TO MY COLLEAGUE JAN FLOREY ON TO SAY CONSUMERS UNION LOOKS FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU TO ADDRESS THESE CHALLENGES I THINK THESE SESSIONS HAVE BEEN ENORMOUSLY INFORMATIVE. AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO BUILDING ON THE TREMENDOUS PROGRESS WE'VE MADE OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS BUT OF COURSE NOT TO REST ON OUR LAURELS. CALIFORNIA DOES LIKE TO LEAD AND. THEY'RE DOABLE CONCRETE STEPS THAT WE CAN TAKE TO BUILD ON OUR SHARED VISION FOR UNIVERSAL CARE SO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THINKING. I GOOD AFTERNOON OR EVENING WHENEVER WE ARE NOW HAVES I'M GEN FLORI WITH WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY. AND WESTERN CENTER IS CALIFORNIA'S OLDEST AND LARGEST LEGAL SERVICES SUPPORT AGENCY WORKING DIRECTLY WITH LEGAL SERVICES PROVIDERS AROUND THE STATE IN PARTICULAR MEMBERS OF THE HEALTH CONSUMER ALLIANCE WHO OFFER FREE WILL LEGAL ASSISTANCE TO HEALTH CONSUMERS AROUND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I'VE BEEN ASKED TO DISCUSS THE ISSUES ARE LEGAL SERVICES PARTNER SEE ON THE GROUND IN HELPING CONSUMERS ACCESS HEALTH CARE IN OUR CURRENT HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. SPECIFICALLY ISSUES FACED BY CONSUMERS MOVING FROM ONE PRODUCT TO ANOTHER WHAT WE'RE NOW CALLING CHURN. BUT FIRST TO GIVE SOME CONTEXT JUST A COUPLE YEARS AGO WHEN I WAS A SUPERVISING ATTORNEY AT A LOCAL HEALTH CONSUMER CENTER THE BIGGEST PROBLEM THAT WE FACED WAS THE POPULATION WE NOW CALL THE EXPANSION ADULTS. NOT HAVING ACCESS TO MEDICARE OUT AND BASICALLY TELLING THEM THAT WE HAD TO WAIT UNTIL THEY'RE. NOT CONDITION DETERIORATED TO SUCH THE CASE THAT THEY QUALIFY FOR MEDI CAL ON THE BASIS OF DISABILITY. AND THEN FOR THOSE JUST OVER THAT INCOME LIMIT. THIS SITUATION WAS JUSTICE DIRE PRETTY MUCH EVERYONE NEEDING HEALTH CARE HAD A PRE EXISTING CONDITIONS THAT THEY WERE EITHER REFUSE CARE ENTIRELY ARE PRICED OUT OF THE MARKET. SO JUST LATER LEVEL FROM WHERE WE'VE COME. WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT NOW IS A DIFFERENT KIND OF BEAST? WHAT WE FIND NOW IS THAT FEW CONSUMERS HAVE THE LUXURY OF REMAINING WITH THE SAME HEALTH PLAN AND HEALTH PROVIDERS THROUGHOUT THEIR LIFE? MANY LOW INCOME CONSUMERS IN PARTICULAR MOVE AMONG MEDI CAL COVER CALIFORNIA AND EMPLOYER SPONSORED COVERAGE DUE TO UNSTABLE WORKING CONDITIONS. THIS MOVEMENT THROUGH THE HEALTH CARE MARKET BRINGS THE FOLLOWING KINDS OF PROBLEMS. WHEN CHOOSING A PLAN CONSUMERS WITH HIGH HEALTH NEEDS MUST SOLVE A COMPLEX MATRIX TO ENSURE THAT ALL OF THEIR DRUGS AND PROVIDERS ARE COVERED. SOME CONSUMERS MIGHT TRY TO STAY WITH THE SAME CARRIER NOT REALIZING THAT FOR MOST CARRIERS THE PROVIDER NETWORK VARIES ACROSS LINES OF BUSINESS IN OTHER WORDS ANTHEM GROUP BLUE CROSS EMPLOYER COVERAGE IS NOT THE SAME AS ANTHEM BLUE CROSS INDIVIDUAL COVERAGE OR ANTHEM BLUE CROSS MEDI CAL. ADDITIONALLY IN SOME AREAS JUST BECAUSE SOMEONE HAS JOINED A% PARTICULAR PLAN THAT DOES NOT MEAN THEY HAVE ACCESS TO ALL THE PROVIDERS IN THAT PLAN AS THE PLANTS THEMSELVES ARE FURTHER DIVIDED INTO PROVIDER SUBGROUPS. MANY CONSUMERS ARE LEFT WITH THE CHOICE OF WHO DO THEY LIKE BETTER THEIR PRIMARY CARE DOCTOR OR THEIR ONCOLOGIST. FURTHER COMPLICATING THE CHOICES THAT NOT ALL PLANS IN THE PRIVATE MARKET COVERED THE SAME PRESCRIPTION DRUGS SO CONSUMERS WHO NEED PARTICULAR MEDICATIONS MUST COMPARE DRUG FORMULARIES TO PICK THE RIGHT PLAN. MOST OF THEM COMPARE WE EVEN READ A DRUG FORMULARY I FIND IT DIFFICULT MYSELF. AGAIN WHICH WOULD YOU PREFER THE RIGHT MEDICATION OR STAINED WITH THE PREFERRED DOCTOR. CHANGES IN PREMIUM PRICE CAN ALSO REQUIRE CONSUMERS TO CHANGE PLANS EVERY YEAR IN BOTH THE EMPLOYER MARKET AND THE INDIVIDUAL MARKET THE CHEAPEST PLAN AVAILABLE TO A GIVEN CONSUMER CAN CHANGE FROM YEAR TO YEAR. BECAUSE PLANS ARE EXPENSIVE TO BEGIN WITH MANY CONSUMERS MAY SHOP EVERY YEAR TO FIND THE BEST DEAL. BEYOND THE PREMIUM PRICE CONSUMERS ALSO REQUIRED AB COMPLEX UNDERSTANDING OF HEALTH COVERAGE TERMINOLOGY TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY OVER ANY GIVEN SERVICE WHEN A DEDUCTIBLE APPLIES WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A CO PANICO INSURANCE. AND WHAT'S THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT THAT CAN BE REQUIRED TO PAY IN ANY GIVEN YEAR. IN ADDITION CHANGES IN A CONSUMERS INCOME CAN CAUSE INDIVIDUALS TO MOVE BETWEEN MEDI CAL AND COVERED CALIFORNIA MULTIPLE TIMES A YEAR. FOR MANY PEOPLE THESE TRANSITIONS ARE NOT SEEM LESS AND RESULT MONTHS OF OVERLAPPING COVERAGE CAUSING CONFUSION WHEN THEY GO TO GET SERVICES AND IN SOME CASES REQUIRING LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS TO CONTINUE PAYING PREMIUMS THAT THEY DO NOT ACTUALLY OWN CANNOT AFFORD. CHANGES IN A PLANTS PROVIDER NETWORK CAN ALSO FORCE PLAN CHANGES SUCH AS WHEN ONE MEDI CAL MANAGED CARE PLAN RECENTLY STOPPED CONTRACTING WITH THE LARGEST HOSPITAL SYSTEM IN THE SACRAMENTO AREA. FINALLY WHETHER IN MEDI CAL ON PRIVATE INSURANCE CONSUMERS. WHO KNOW THEY WILL BE CHANGING PLANS GENERALLY CANNOT WORK WITH THEIR NEW PLAN AHEAD OF TIME TO SET APPOINTMENTS GET PROPER REFERRALS TO SPECIALISTS ARRANGE FOR PRESCRIPTION REFILLS? THEY MUST WAIT UNTIL THEIR PLAN ENROLLMENT IS ACTIVE BEFORE ARRANGING FOR THE SERVICES. WELL THIS MIGHT SEEM LIKE A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME TO GO WITHOUT ACCESS TO CARE FOR PEOPLE WITH HIGH MEDICAL NEEDS TO DISRUPTIONS CAN BE DANGEROUS. AND FOR MANY PEOPLE THOSE DISRUPTIONS ARE OCCURRING MORE AND MORE FREQUENTLY AS A BOUNCE TO THE SYSTEM. NOW UNFORTUNATELY THERE'S NOT ONE EASY SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM. WHILE PERSONALLY I WOULD LOVE A SINGLE PAYER SYSTEM THE CURRENT PROPOSAL WE HAVE BEFORE US IS DEPENDENT ON A DISCRETIONARY FEDERAL WAIVER OF MEDICARE AND MEDICAID LAW. THE FORDS FINANCING AND LAST WEEK THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION MADE ABUNDANTLY CLEAR THAT IT WOULD NOT BE GRANTING ANY WAIVERS EXPANDING ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE. INSTEAD IT WOULD LOOK TO GRANT WAIVERS RESTRICTING ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE BY IMPOSING ADDITIONAL BURDENS ON PEOPLE SUCH AS WORK REQUIREMENTS. PREMIUMS AND LOCK OUT PERIODS AND THEY DID JUST THAT AND GRANTING CAN'T THE STATE OF KENTUCKY JUST SUCH A WAIVER. THIS MOVES US AWAY FROM OUR SHARED GOAL OF GUARANTEED ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE AND BACK TOWARDS ONLY CARE FOR THOSE WHO CAN PAY FOR IT OR THOSE WHO DESERVE IT. FOR THOSE OF US WHO HAVE SPENT YEARS WORKING TO IMPLEMENT HEALTH CARE REFORM WE KNOW IT'S NOT EASY WE KNOW WE CAN GET EVERYTHING WE WANT IMMEDIATELY BUT THERE ARE ALSO WAYS TO IMPROVE FRAGMENTATION. ONE EXAMPLE. LAST YEAR ANTHEM BLUE CROSS ANNOUNCED THAT IT WOULD BE LEAVING THE INDIVIDUAL MARKET AND SUIT IN SEVERAL REGIONS OF COVERED CALIFORNIA. THIS HAD THE EFFECT OF POTENTIALLY DESTABILIZING OUR ENTIRE MARKET ON COVERED CALIFORNIA. CONSUMER ADVOCATES WORKED QUICKLY WITH A LEGISLATOR TO PASS SB ONE THIRTY THREE TO EXPAND OUR CONTINUITY OF CARE PROTECTION SO THAT THOSE WHO WERE FORCED TO PICK A PLAN AND WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF TREATMENT WOULD HAVE ADDITIONAL TIME TO FIND YOU PROVIDERS. ANTHEM BLUE CROSS WORKED WITH THE OTHER COVER CALIFORNIA PLANS TO CREATE A SYSTEM WHICH PATIENT RECORDS COULD BE TRANSMITTED TO AVOID SOME OF THE MOST COMMON DISRUPTIONS IN MOVING FROM ONE PLANT TO THE NEXT. CONSUMER ADVOCATES WORKED WITH COVER CALIFORNIA TO ENSURE THAT CONSUMERS WOULD RECEIVE SUFFICIENT INFORMATION ABOUT THE CHANGE AND THAT THOSE WHO DID NOT PICKING YOU PLAN WOULD BE ASSIGNED TO A NEW PLAN AND NOT GO WITHOUT COVERAGE. WELL IT'S TOO SOON TO EVALUATE HOW SUCCESSFUL THAT PROJECT HAS BEEN. AND SO FAR WE'RE NOT RECEIVING A WHOLE BUNCH OF CALLS ABOUT PROBLEMS WITH IS THAT OUR HEALTH CONSUMERS CENTERS BUT WE'LL GIVE IT A FEW MORE WEEKS TO SEE IF IT'S. ACTUALLY WORKED OUT IT HAS CREATED A TESTING GROUND FOR EASING DISRUPTIONS AT CONSUMERS FACE WHEN CHANGING COVERAGE. CONSUMER ADVOCATES HAVE ALREADY BEAT BEGUN DISCUSSION DISCUSSING OPTIONS WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES. TO SEE IF SIMILAR PLANNING CAN BE DONE IN COORDINATING CARED FOR ENROLLEES MOVING FROM ONE MEDI CAL PAYMENT SYSTEM TO ANOTHER OR FROM ONE MEDI CAL PLAN TO ANOTHER. SO IN SHORT THE WORK OF IMPLEMENTING THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT IN THE CONTINUED REFORM OF OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM IS NOT DONE WE STILL HAVE POPULATIONS THAT HE COVERAGE INCLUDING UNDOCUMENTED ADULTS AND SMALL POPULATIONS OF SENIORS. WE STILL HAVE PEOPLE THAT CANNOT AFFORD CARE EVEN WITH SUBSIDIES AND WE STILL HAVE SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES IN CREATING SEAMLESS TRANSITIONS IN MOVING FROM PROGRAM TO PROGRAM AND PLAN THE PLAN. BUT THERE ARE STEPS THAT WE CAN TAKE NOW TO EXPAND ELIGIBILITY FOR MEDICARE PROGRAM TO IMPROVE SUBSIDIES TO EASE TRANSITIONS BETWEEN CLANS. SO THAT WE HAVE THE BEST SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE AND THEN PERHAPS AT ONE POINT WE CAN GET TO A MORE UNIFIED SYSTEM THAT WOULD MAKE ALL OF THESE PROBLEMS GO AWAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WITH THAT WE'RE GOING TO MOVE TO PUBLIC COMMENT. AS I STATED EARLIER THERE ARE TWO MIKES ON THE BOTTOM FLOOR AND A WIRELESS MIKE ON THE TOP. WE'RE GOING TO START ON OUR LEFT AND IF WE CAN. TWO MINUTES PLEASE JUST BECAUSE OF PEOPLE. AND. START WITH THAT THINKING. OAY HIGH. MY NAME IS MARTHA KUHL. AYE AM THE TREASURER OF CALIFORNIA NURSES ASSOCIATION I AM. A. I'VE BEEN IN ARE IN FOR OVER THIRTY SIX YEARS AND I'M A PEDIATRIC HEMATOLOGY ONCOLOGY TRANSPLANT NURSE. AND FOR THOSE WHO DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS I TAKE CARE OF KIDS WITH VERY SERIOUS DISEASES. CANCER AND OTHER DISEASES OF THE BLOOD. AND HAVING ATTENDED THESE HEARINGS IT IS CLEAR THAT THE PREMISE HAS BEEN. THAT HEALTHCARE IS VERY COMPLEX. AND THE EXPERT WITH WILL TELL US WHAT THE PROBLEMS ARE AND WILL HELP TO SOLVE THEM. BUT MANY HAVE GIVEN WIDELY VARYING ANSWERS. NURSES CAN TELL YOU THAT WE ALREADY KNEW. WE KNEW THAT. WE PRACTICE IN A TIERED MULTI PAYER SYSTEM. WHERE SOME GET EXCELLENT CARE? SOME GET SOME CARE AND SOME GET NO CARE AT ALL. HEALTH IS TREATED AS A COMMODITY. AND PATIENTS GET THE CARE THEY CAN AFFORD. NURSES KNOW THAT ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE SHOULD NOT BE COMPLICATED. ARE CALLING AND OUR DUTY IS TO GIVE EVERY PATIENT. EVERY PATIENT PATIENT ADVOCATES. AS PATIENT ADVOCATES TO PROVIDE A SINGLE STANDARD OF CARE. WE AS A CARING AND COMPASSIONATE SOCIETY. CAN MAKE THE DECISION TO GUARANTEE HEALTH CARE AS A SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC RIGHT. THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE TO DO. FOR EVERY PROBLEM IDENTIFIED TODAY FOR EVERY PROBLEM IT QUESTION ASKED TODAY THE ANSWER IS THAT WE GUARANTEE HEALTH CARE. SO. RATHER THAN HOLD THESE HEARINGS WHERE YOU CAN'T LEGISLATE. RENDON SHOULD RELEASE SP FIVE SIX TWO AND YOU AS ASSEMBLY. AS OUR LEGISLATORS SHOULD DEMAND TO COME TO YOUR COMMITTEE. AND YOU CAN ADDRESS ANY ISSUES AND CONCERNS HERE IN THIS ROOM WITH ALL OF US AND GUARANTEE HEALTH CARE FOR US ALL. DO YOUR JOB ADVANCE SP FIVE SIX TWO THROUGH THE USUAL LEGISLATIVE PROCESS THANK YOU OUR PATIENTS CAN'T WAIT. THE KEY. COMMITTEE MEMBERS THREE TIMES A BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION OTHER LOT INFORMATION THIS HEARING TODAY SO I'M GOING TO LIMIT MY COMMENTS TO PHYSICIAN WORKFORCE ISSUES. UP FIRST I DO WANT TO ADDRESS ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRIEDMAN QUESTION ABOUT WHY CALIFORNIA SEEMS TO HAVE. A HIGHER UP POSITION SHORTAGE AS COMPARED TO OTHER STATES MOST OF GRADUATE MEDICAL MEDICAL EDUCATION FUNDING THIS IS RESIDENCY SLOTS. IT'S FEDERAL MONEY IT ACTUALLY FROZE THOSE RATE THEM LOCKED INTO A RATIO BASED ON ABOUT THE MID TO LATE NINETEEN NINETIES. SINCE THEN OUR POPULATIONS INCREASE. AT A MUCH HIGHER RATE COMPARED OTHER STATES SO WE WOULD ARGUE FORGET THEM MUCH LESS IN OUR FAIR SHARE FEDERAL FUNDING. I'M READY METAL MEDICAL EDUCATION AND AND THAT'S WHY WE RAN PROP FIFTY SIX. A COALITION OF HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS A CONSUMER ADVOCATES AS WELL AND A LOT OF BIG YOU DOCTOR WEIR AND DOCTOR REGULATORS INCREASE FUNDING FOR GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION IN THAT. PROPOSITION WE HAD TO HAVE SOME BUDGET FIGHTS TO GET IT BACK UP IN THE ACTUAL BUDGET BUT IT IS THEIR RIGHT NOW BUT BUT THERE'S SOME ADDITIONAL MONEYS. DONE THAT WE CAN. GET FROM THAT PROPOSITION. GOING FORWARD ON THIS COMMITTEE I THINK THERE'S THREE ISSUES. THE MEDICAL ASSOCIATION WOULD LIKE TO TACKLE A AS IT RELATES TO WORKFORCE. THAT THREE POLICY IDEAS WOULD BE LONGER PAYMENT. RESI PROGRAMS THAT NONTRADITIONAL FACILITIES LIKE CLINICS AND INCREASED GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION FUNDING FROM STATE ONLY FUNDS A TO INCREASE OUR SLOTS SO WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEE ON DEVELOPING THOSE IDEAS. AS LEGISLATIVE EUROSPORT THANK YOU GOD. YES SIR. HI GOOD AFTERNOON I THINK YOU ALL FOR SHOWING UP TO THIS LONG HEARINGS AND DUKING IT OUT WEST. MY NAME SHAUNA HEFFERNAN I AM PROUD UNION NURSE I AM A JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY GRADUATE AND I'VE BEEN A NURSE FOR ALMOST A DECADE NOW. I DO SURGICAL RECOVERY ANESTHESIA AND I'VE BEEN A CRITICAL CARE NURSE HERE. TRANSPORT IN SACRAMENTO FOR SOME YEARS AS WELL SO I'VE BEEN TO ALMOST EVERY FACILITY HERE IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT THE CARE VARIES. WIDELY. THERE IS A STANDARD OF CARE AND THE SCOPE OF PRACTICE AND EVERY PERSON DESERVES THE RIGHT TO THE SAME. STANDARD OF CARE. BASED ON INCOME CLASS RACE THESE ARE NOT VARIABLES THAT US AS NURSES CONSIDER TO BE IMPORTANT. I WANTED TO ADDRESS. THE FEDERAL MANDATE AND SAY THAT. YOU HAVE TO BUY CAR INSURANCE TO DRIVE ON THE ROAD. FOR ALL HUMAN BEINGS ON THIS PLANET AND WE SHARE THE AIR IN THE RESOURCES AND EVERYONE NEEDS TO HAVE SOME COVERAGE IN ORDER TO ENSURE OUR EXISTENCE AS HUMAN BEINGS. IT IS A RIGHT IT'S NOT SOMETHING WE CAN LIVE WITHOUT. IT'S NOT. BUYING AND NICER PAIR OF PANTS OR A NICER CAR. IT'S ABSOLUTELY SOMETHING THAT NONE OF US CAN LIVE WITHOUT IT'S A HUGE EXPENDITURE FOR BUSINESS AND SENATE BILL FIVE SIX THAT YOU WOULD ALLOW US TO HAVE THAT MECHANISM OF COST CONTROL. AN MRI DOES NOT COST TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS AN XRAY DOES NOT COST FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS WE'VE ALLOWED INSURANCE COMPANIES TO BILL WHATEVER THEY WANT IN THE SHADOW PRICING THE MECHANISMS OF THE FREE MARKET ARE NOT IN PLAY HERE. THEY'RE OUT OF CONTROL AND IS THE ROLE OF GOVERNMENT YOUR ROLE. TO REGULATE THIS PROCESS. THE DEBATE GOING BACK TO THE FOUNDING OF OUR COUNTRY OF FEDERAL VERSUS STATE POWER IS. EXACTLY HERE TODAY IN THAT I DON'T CARE WHAT THIS PRESIDENT HAS DECIDED HE'S GOING TO DO THIS IS OUR STATE WE CAN MAKE AN INDEPENDENT PLAY AND WE CAN SET THE STANDARD FOR THE FUTURE AND SHOW. A MODEL THAT WORKS NOW AND IN THE FUTURE FOR ALL AMERICANS THINK KIM. I'VE IT'S POSSIBLE I'D LIKE TO GIVE THE ASSEMBLY OF THESE PACKETS IT'S ONE FOR EACH ASSEMBLY MEMBER. IF YOU GIVE IT AS ARGENTEUIL DELIVER. I NEVER STILL FOUNTAIN I AM WITH ENACT UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE FOR CALIFORNIA. SINGLE PAYER ORGANIZATIONS OVER HUNDRED TWO THOUSAND SUPPORTERS A STATEWIDE. WERE SPONSORING THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH CARE ROADBLOCK MOVIL ACT. A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT. BY ITSELF WILL NOT IMPLEMENT UNIVERSAL HEALTHCARE BUT WILL ENABLE ANY FUTURE HEALTH CARE LEGISLATION IN THE STATE WITHOUT HAVING GO THE BALLOT EACH TIME. CAL MATTERS WROTE ABOUT. THE. CONSTITUTION AMENDMENT. EARLIER THIS YEAR A FOLDER HEALTH INITIATIVE CAMPAIGN PROPOSES TO SET UP A HEALTH CARE FUND EXEMPT FROM THE SPENDING CAPS AND REVENUE SHARING REQUIREMENTS. TO CONSTRAIN OTHER AREAS OF THE BUDGET MOST BUDGET EXPERTS ARGUE THAT THIS IS A NECESSARY FIRST STEP BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE CAN PASS. STATE RUN SINGLE PAYER HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM. AYE JUST AS AN EXAMPLE OF. WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE TOTAL HEALTHCARE SPENDING IN CALIFORNIA IS FOUR HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS. AND OF THE STATE SIMPLY HELD THAT AND PAID IT BACK OUT TWO HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS WOULD AUTOMATICALLY BE SENT TO OUR EDUCATION VIA PROP NINETY EIGHT. PROP FOR WITH REBATE HUNDRED NINETY FOUR BILLION DOLLARS FROM THE OTHER HALF BACK TO TAXPAYERS HEALTH CARE WOULD BE LEFT WITH ALMOST NOTHING. I THE CONSTITUTIONAL MIMIC COSTS NOTHING AND SPECIFICALLY WRITTEN THAT WAY DELEON SAID IT HAS NO DIRECT FISCAL IMPACT. IN ALTON BE EXEMPT FROM PROP NINETY EIGHT PROP FOR THEIR OTHERWISE LEAVES THESE RESTRICTIONS INTACT. I MEAN DOESN'T GET ANYTHING ODD SO IF YOU BELIEVE IT'S TIME FOR CALIFORNIA START TAKING CONTROL OF ITS HEALTH CARE. AND PLEASE HELP US GET. CALIFORNIA HEALTHCARE ROADBLOCK MOVE LACKED ON THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN BALLOT THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR. CAN RELIGION WITH A CALIFORNIA PAN ETHNIC HEALTH NETWORK CPN APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATION HERE TODAY ONE FOCUS MY COMMENTS STAY ON THE QUALITY OF CARE PARTICULARLY IN MEDI CAL. WOULD WE WOULD AGREE WITH MANY OF THE POINTS AND MR CRONIES. PRESENTATION. IT IT'S NOT OKAYED THAT OF MEDI CAL PERFORMS JUST OKAY COMPARED TO THE REST NATION AND. NOT OKAY THAT IT'S NOT IMPROVING. GETS READ SIZE OF OF THE POPULATION IT SERVES AND THE DIVERSITY OF THE POPULATION INSERTS WHICH BRINGS ME TO MY NEXT POINT WHICH IS THE QUALITY OF CARE HOUSE TO REALLY CONSIDER. EQUITY IN DISPARITIES REDUCTION IF NOT LOOKING AT RACE ETHNICITY GENDER GEOGRAPHIC REGION INCOME. ALL THOSE OTHER THINGS AND WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE LOOKING AT THAT WORKS REDUCE MORE IMPROVING QUALITY IN THE LONG RUN THOSE DISPARITIES WILL NOT. DECREASE. TO REALLY SPEAK OUT CONSERVE THAT WAY AND WE'RE GOING TO BE LOOKING AT THE. OUTCOMES AND AND PERFORMANCE AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT. THOSE ARE A KEY PART OF THAT COUNTRY. SO DO ARE SADISTIC. AS THIS COMMITTEE CONSIDERS WAYS TO PROVIDE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. GOOD EVENING CHAIRS AND MEMBERS MAY SHOCK OF DATA WITH THE SERVICE EMPLOYEES INTERNATIONAL UNION CALIFORNIA STATE COUNCIL. DITTO EVERYTHING. OUR COLLEAGUE FROM C. PEN JUST SAID ON MEDI CAL AND DISPARITIES AND QUALITY. ALSO WANT TO FOCUS MY REMARKS ON A DOUBLING DOWN ON SOME OF THE TESTIMONY RELATED TO COST CONTAINMENT AND PRICES. AS THIS SELECT COMMITTEE HEARING PROCESS HAS SHOWN A COMMON FEATURE OF ALL THE UNIVERSAL HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS WHETHER THEIR SINGLE PAYER OR MULTI PEER AROUND THE WORLD IS THAT THEY DO REGULATE PRICES AND CONTROL COSTS. FAR MORE AGGRESSIVELY THAN WE DO IN THE UNITED STATES AND THAT IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE THAT SUCH A SYSTEM IS SUSTAINABLE IN THE LONG RUN WE NEED TO BE MUCH MORE AMBITIOUS ABOUT HOW WE APPROACH THAT. AND THAT WE ARE A UNION OF HIGH HEALTHCARE WORKERS WHO STAND READY OUT TO WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE TO TACKLE THOSE VERY DIFFICULT ISSUES BECAUSE AT THE BARGAINING TABLE EVERY SINGLE DAY. WE ARE THE ONES WHO ARE SEEING THE INCOME IN A COLOR QUALITY GAP GROW AND GROW EVEN FOR HARD WORKING PEOPLE. AND I THINK THAT IT'S GOVERNMENT AND WORKERS WHO SHARE COMMON CAUSE BECAUSE OUR EMPLOYERS CAN TO SHIFT THOSE COSTS ON TO US. AND SO. THE MOMENT IS RIGHT FOR US TO START TO TAKE ACTION ON THIS WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU THINK YOU. THANK YOU. I GOOD EVENING MR CHAIRS AND THE MEMBERS AND TAM MA WITH HEALTH ACCESS CALIFORNIA WHERE THE HEALTH A STATEWIDE HEALTHCARE CONSUMER ADVOCATES THE COALITION. ONE ECHO THE COMMENTS OF MY CONSUMER ADVOCATES COLLEAGUES TO SERVE ON THE PANEL TODAY AND ALSO JUST REITERATE HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO ADDRESS. HEALTHCARE COSTS AT THE PREVIOUS HEARING. FORMER VERMONT GOVERNOR PETER SHUMLIN THEY'LL REALLY EMPHASIZE THAT. THE STATE NEEDS TO TACKLE COST CONTAINMENT. IF IT'S GOING TO TRY TO ACHIEVE LARGER HEALTH REFORM AND UNIVERSAL COVERAGE AND I THINK EVERYTHING THAT YOU HEARD TODAY FROM THE PANELISTS YES BUT VERY MUCH SPOKE TO THAT. AS THE LATE AND GREAT. MOVE A RIGHT HEART STATED IT'S THE PRICES STUPID AND WE KNOW THAT PEOPLE UNITED STATES SPEND MORE MONEY ON HEALTHCARE THAN ANY OTHER COUNTRY AND WE ALSO YOU'LL USE LESS HEALTH CARE THE THAT'S WHAT WE NEED TO TACKLE AND HEALTH ACCESS HAS BROUGHT BILLS IN THE PAST AND WILL CONTINUE TO BUILD BRING BILLS IN THE FUTURE TO INCREASE TRANSPARENCY. TO GET A BETTER HANDLE ON PRICES UNTIL OF CONSOLIDATION AND WHAT NOT AND WE VERY MUCH APPRECIATE YOUR EFFORTS TODAY AND LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU OF THIS UPCOMING SUCH. THANK YOU. MR SHARE MEMBERS TERAFLOPS FROM THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION AMID ECHO MY SISTERS FROM. BRENT HELP ACCESS AN STI YOU. R. TWELVE HUNDRED AFFILIATED UNIONS NEGOTIATE FOR AND PAY FOR HEALTH CARE FOR TWO MILLION MEMBERS. AND THEY SEE. THE MONEY THAT GOES OUT FOR EVERY HOSPITAL VISIT FOR EVERY DOCTOR'S VISIT FOR ALL THE OUT PATIENT CARE THAT IS GIVEN FOR ALL OF THE PREMIUMS AND THEY KNOW THAT THAT IS MONEY COMING DIRECTLY OUT OF OUR MEMBERS POCKETS. IT'S MONEY THEY'RE NOT GETTING IN RAISES IN WAGES AND AND CONTRIBUTIONS TO PENSIONS IT IS GOING TO HEALTH CARE. AND THIS IS KILLING OUR UNIONS AT THE TABLE AND IN ORGANIZING AND IT IS HURTING PEOPLE ACROSS THE STATE IT IS WHAT IS AS THE SISTER MESSY AYE YOU SAID FUELING. IN EQUALITY IN THE STATE THIS IS NOT JUST A HEALTH CARE ISSUE THIS IS AN ECONOMIC ISSUE ANNA OF FAIRNESS AND JUSTICE ISSUE FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND WE VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THAT YOU'RE TAKING ON THE ISSUE OF PRICES. THAT IS KIND OF THAT ONE OF THE KEY IN REINING IN COSTS WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE PRICE OF HEALTH CARE. AND WE HAVE DONE AS A LOT OF WORK ON TRANSPARENCY WE RISK SPONSORS OF AN S. B. SEVENTEEN. AND. WE MAY NEED AS A STEP TAKEN A STEP FORWARD AND MOVE FROM TRANSPARENCY TO SOME FORM OF PRICE REGULATION. SO WE APPRECIATE THE DISCUSSION THANK YOU THANK YOU. CHAIRS AND ASSEMBLYMEMBERS MY NAME IS SANDY READING I'M AN OPERATING ROOM NURSE OF THIRTY YEARS AND ON THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS FOR THE CALIFORNIA NURSES ASSOCIATION. I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE CAO THANK YOU FOR STAYING LATE AND THANK THE CAL LABOR FED FOR ENDORSING SENATE BILL FIVE SIX TWO. WE'VE ALSO HEARD A LOT OF STATISTICAL AND ANALYTICAL DATA AND I'D LIKE TO SHARE SOME OF MY OWN. BEING A NURSE FOR THIRTY YEARS IN THE OPERATING ROOM I CAN TELL YOU THAT THE STUDIES DO SUPPORT THAT IF YOU SEE YOUR DOCTOR IN A TIMELY MANNER ON A REGULAR BASIS. TAKE THE PRESCRIBED TREATMENT AND THE MEDICATIONS WITHOUT SPLITTING YOUR PILLS THEN YOU WILL HAVE BETTER OUTCOMES. THAT'S A NO BRAINER. S. B. FIVE SIX TWO WHICH FACILITATE THAT WE'VE ALSO HEARD THAT HEALTH CARE IS EXPENSIVE. OF COURSE WE KNOW IT'S EXPENSIVE ESPECIALLY IF YOU LIVE IN THE UNITED STATES. PATIENT SHOULDN'T BE COMMODITIES AND WE SHOULDN'T CAPITALIZE ON THEIR ILLNESSES IT REALLY DISCUSS ME TO SEE THIS HAPPEN EVERY DAY IN MY PRACTICE. AS A PATIENT GOES TO SLEEP AND I'M HOLDING THEIR HAND WHILE THEY'RE UNDERGOING GENERAL ANESTHESIA I WONDER HOW MANY PATIENTS AREN'T MAKING IT TO MY OR TABLE. RIGHT WE HAVE TO HAVE THE EVERYBODY THAT NEEDS THE CARE GET THE CARE THAT THEY NEED AND HAVE THAT SINGLE STARE STANDARD OF CARE. WE DO NEED I HEARD MERGERS SOMETIMES BECAUSE MARKET FAILURES YES THEY DO BIGGER IS NOT ALWAYS BETTER. S. B. FIVE SIX TWO WOULD ALLEVIATE A LOT OF THE PROBLEMS THAT WE'RE HEARING TODAY. AND. IT IS. WHAT WE'RE ASKING IS THAT YOU MEET WITH THE SPONSORS ADDRESS ALL OF THE AMENDMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN SITTING THERE FOR MONTHS? AND. DO THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS WE ELECTED OUR ELECTED OFFICIALS TO REPRESENT US AND WHEN IT'S BEING THE BILL IS BEING HELD HOSTAGE. THEN NOBODY CAN DEBATE IT NOBODY CAN LISTEN TO THE AMENDMENTS THAT WE PUT FORWARD. AND NOBODY CAN PASS THIS BILL THAT WE SO DILIGENTLY NEED NOW. YES. THE PRESIDENT DID SAY SOMETHING ABOUT WAIVERS BUT YOU KNOW WHAT I'M AYE OR TABLE IF I GET A CAR ACCIDENT VICTIM I'M NOT GONNA SAY YOUR CHANCES ARE VERY GOOD. I'M NOT GOING TO WORK FOR YOU I'M GONNA DO MY DARNDEST AND I WILL FIGHT UNTIL WE GET THIS PAST JUST LIKE I FIGHT FOR MY PATIENTS EVERYDAY. THANK YOU. WELL IT'S AFTER FIVE O'CLOCK. MY NAME IS JEFF TARGET YEAR I AM AN ADVOCATE. PART A DOG FIGHT I'M CARVE CAR. I'M PART OF POWELL AND THERE'S A MULTIPLE OTHERS I'M A NATIVE SACRAMENTO IN. SINGLE PAYER HOW MANY TIMES DOES IT HAVE TO COME UP AND FOR THIS COMMITTEE. WHY IN THE WORLD WAS THERE NO ANALYST PUT YOU HAD OVER A YEAR AGO UP THE BILL AND HOW YOU FACILITATE SINGLE PAYER? I'M SORRY. YOU DON'T HAVE ANYTHING SO PLEASE MAKE IT WORK RENDON GET OFF YOUR* AND MAKE THIS HAPPEN THANK YOU. I COULD AFTERNOON AND AGAIN THANK YOU FOR LETTING US STAY HERE LATE. MY NAME IS LESLIE ESTHER I AM A NURSE OR REGISTERED NURSE FROM EUREKA CALIFORNIA. I WORK ON AN IN PATIENT REHABILITATION UNIT THAT'S PRIMARILY STROKES AND DRAMATIC BRAIN INJURY. WE HEARD A LOT OF SUGGESTIONS TODAY OF HOW WE COULD TWEAK ARE VERY FRACTURED AND BROKEN HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. I. ALONG WITH MANY OTHER CALIFORNIA ORIENTS IT'S MY CONTENTION THAT THIS TYPE OF INCREMENTALISM. IS NOT THE ANSWER TO THE CRISIS IN OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. IN THIS STATE AND INDEED IN THIS COUNTRY. INCREMENTALISM MAY BRING US A STEP CLOSER TO UNIVERSAL HEALTH. COVERAGE. BY WAY OF FOR PROFIT INSURANCE COMPANIES BUT IT DOES NOT BRING US UNIT BAR GUARANTEED UNIVERSAL HEALTHCARE COVERAGE. WHEN YOU CALL FOR THE FORMER JUST A. WHEN YOU CALL ONLY FOR UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE IS HAVE THE LATTER BEING SILENT ABOUT THE GUARANTEED UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE. IT'S MORALLY INDEFENSIBLE AND IT'S IT'S BEING DONE SO IN THE FACE OF MANY THAT ARE REALLY NEEDLESSLY SUFFERING AND EVEN DYING. CALIFORNIA AT THIS POINT SHE JUST BOLDLY LEAGUE. SINGLE PAYER HEALTHCARE COVERAGE FOR ITS CITIZENS. THANK YOU. I THINK YOU I'M BRIAN STUMP OR I LIVE IN THE VITAL AYE CALIFORNIA. AND THE LIKE TO TELL YOU THAT AN INSURANCE COMPANY CAN'T PRESCRIBE AN ASPIRIN. YOU'VE NEVER HEARD OF SOMEBODY TAKEN A BROKEN ARM TO AN INSURANCE AGENT AND WHY IS SIMPLE. INSURANCE COMPANIES DON'T DO HEALTH CARE. BUT IT'S ABOUT MAKING MONEY AND YOU'RE NOT ABLE TO SELF INSURE A AND YOU CAN'T AFFORD THE RISK THEN YOU NEED INSURANCE I'M THE FIRST PERSON TO TELL YOU THAT. I OWN A SMALL CORPORATION IRAN FOR TWENTY SEVEN YEARS. AND. IE. AND INTERESTED IN COULD COST I THINK THAT THE REPUBLICANS SHOULD PROBABLY BE SPIRITING THIS THING THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE INTERESTED IN BUSINESS THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE CAME HERE. WHEN THIS THING WAS INTRODUCED AND SPOKE AGAINST IT. WHY THEY DID I DON'T KNOW BECAUSE PROBABLY NINETY EIGHT PERCENT OF THEIR? PEOPLE WOULD GAIN GREATLY WITH A. SINGLE PAYER. FARMERS SMALL PEOPLE THAT LIVE IN JIM WOOD SYRIA. THAT ARE BUSINESSMEN. THEY'D GAIN OF BY THIS. AND. OUR LIST DISCUSSIONS GOTTA BE ABOUT HEALTH CARE YOU KNOW NOT NOT ABOUT INSURANCE. IS THAT MY TIME. YOU WILL LIKE IT. WELL OKAY WOMEN SO. SINGLE PAYER THAT POLAND REPORT SHOWS WE CAN SAVE THIRTY EIGHT MY HALF BILLION DOLLARS. JIM ARE PART OF THAT THIRTY EIGHT MAY HAVE BILLION DOLLARS COULD BE USED FOR SCHOLARSHIPS FOR MEDICAL PROVIDERS DOCTORS AND OTHER PEOPLE. IT WITH THE PROVISION THAT NOW I'D. YOU KNOW I DID OKAY I'M THAT I'M ON SINGLE PAYER NOW I'VE GOT MEDICARE I LIVE IN MARIN COUNTY SO I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT THIS OR YOU KNOW FOR MYSELF THIS IS FOR YOUR PEOPLE. GOOD AFTERNOON EVERYONE MY NAME IS THE PLANES HAD I NOT BEEN A REGISTERED NURSE FOR THIRTEEN YEARS. AND I CURRENTLY WORK AND MEDICAL TELEMETRY. THE REAL PROBLEM HERE REALLY IS THE LACK OF POLITICAL WILL. ALL THE COUNTER ATTACK ABOUT WHAT SUPPOSEDLY LACKING IN SB FIVE SIX TWO. ARE NOT WHAT MATTERS. IT'S ABOUT DEVELOPING THE COURAGE. WE NEED THE POLITICAL WILL TO TAKE ON INSURANCE COMPANIES. DRUG MANUFACTURERS IN FOR PROFIT HOSPITALS. I FEEL THE ASSEMBLY DEVELOPS THAT COURAGE ALL THE CONCERNS ABOUT S. B. FIVE SIX TWO BEING WOEFULLY INCOMPLETE. OR WE CAN'T DO IT BECAUSE OF PROP NINETY EIGHT GAM LIMIT AT SARAH. NEITHER ALL AGES DIVERSIONARY TACTICS BE SIGNED A KEEP. FOCUSED ON THE FACT THAT THERE IS SOME BEER AT LACK OF POLITICAL WILL IN THE ASSEMBLY. DEFINITELY HEALTH CARE IS A BASIC HUMAN RIGHT. AND ALL SEEM TO AGREE. AND YET SADLY AND DISAPPOINTINGLY SPEAKER RENDON SAID IT'S CRIMINAL FOR THE NURSES TO BE SEEN CALIFORNIA CAN PROVIDE GUARANTEED HEALTHCARE TO EVERYONE. WE NEED HEALTH CARE. WE NEED GUARANTEED HEALTHCARE FOR ALL. WE NEED S. B. FIVE SIXTY TWO POUNDS THANK YOU. THANK YOU GOOD EVENING I'M PENNY CLARK A LIVE IN MARIN I'M NOT A NURSE AND A LAWYER. BUT I'VE BEEN FOLLOWING SINGLE PAYER FOR A LONG TIME MANY YEARS. AND I HAVE SEEN THE RESISTANCE TO IT THAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND EXCEPT THE ANSWER'S GOT TO LIE IN THE BACK ROOM SOMEWHERE BECAUSE IT'S SUCH AN OBVIOUS WIN WIN. SITUATION. IF WE DIDN'T HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANIES AND THE PROFIT THAT IS ATTACHED TO HAVING HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANIES WE WON'T NEED TO TALK. ABOUT COVERAGE IN PLANS AND PREMIUMS AND UP LIFETIME CAPS AND DENIAL OF CLAIMS AND COPAYS IT CETERA ETCETERA ETCETERA AND. SOMETIMES THE ANSWER TO THE PROBLEM. IS NOT MOST COMPLEX WHEN IT'S THE SIMPLEST ONE. AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE TODAY. JUST I THOUGHT WELL THIS DOESN'T AFFECT ME BUT I LOOK BACK OVER MY LIFE AND I REALIZE WHAT HE ON IT HAS IN MANY WAYS. MANY YEARS AGO MY MY DOCTOR WHO WAS A SINGLE PAYER SUPPORTER. COULDN'T IT. HAVE AN EXPLANATION FOR ME WHEN I COULDN'T GET THE ANTI DEPRESSANT I NEEDED FROM BLUE CROSS THEY WOULD THEY WOULD PAY FORCE FOR PROZAC THEY WOULD PAY FOR PAXIL BUT THEY WOULDN'T PAY FOR RESULT LOFT. AND I ASK HIM WHY AND HE SAID WELL PENNY THAT'S PROBABLY BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T GIVE A BIG ENOUGH. TO THE. THE MANUFACTURE THE BILL. SO ALL IN ON BEYOND THAT I FOUND MYSELF COUPLE YEARS AGO GOING DOWN TO TIJUANA. FOR A CROWN BECAUSE I COULDN'T AFFORD IT UP HERE I DROVE TO TO YOU WANNA STAY THERE THREE DAYS PAID FOR THAT CROWN FOR LESS THAN HALF OF WHAT IT WOULD COST ME UP HERE. SO WE REALLY DO NEED THIS AND I HOPE YOU ALL DO IN THE FUTURE. NOW NEXT YEAR WHENEVER STE JUST KEEP PRESSING THE FACTS SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES KEEP PRESSING FOR THIS BILL. WE NEED. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. BUT EVEN IMPLEMENTED PATRICK BURNS AND WITH THAT CALIFORNIA'S ASSOCIATION OF HEALTH UNDERWRITERS THE. INSURANCE AGENTS AND BROKERS TO WORK WITH OUR COMMUNITIES EVERY DAY BY MAKING SURE OUR CUSTOMERS CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS HAVE ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE HEALTHCARE THROUGH EVERY TYPE OF HEALTH CARE ARRANGEMENT. INCLUDING MEDICARE MEDICAID HOW. INDIVIDUAL PROGRAMS EITHER THROUGH COVER CALIFORNIA OR OUTSIDE THE EXCHANGE. AND EMPLOYER BASED PROGRAMS BOTH INSURED AND SELF FUNDED ARRANGEMENTS. THROUGH OUR EFFORTS AMONGST MANY OTHERS. CALIFORNIA'S NOW AT A RECORD LEVEL OF HEALTH INSURANCE COVERAGE WITH THE UNINSURED RATE AT SIX POINT EIGHT PERCENT. THE LAST WHILE OF COURSE IS THE HARDEST ONE WE STAND WITH THE COMMITTEE TO SUPPORT UNIVERSAL COVERAGE FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS. WE KNOW THAT MOST CALIFORNIANS ARE CURRENTLY HAPPY WITH THEIR HEALTHCARE COVERAGE BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT HAVING SOME WHO DONT DO NOT HAVE ACCESS IS WRONG. AND THAT THE COSTS ARE TOO HIGH. WE URGE THE SELECT COMMITTEE OF THE LEGISLATURE TO WORK TOGETHER WITH ALL STAKEHOLDERS TOWARD FINDING SOLUTIONS THAT ADDRESS MARKET STABILIZATION. VIABLE COST CONTAINMENT SOLUTIONS AND FINDING ACCESS SOLUTIONS FOR THOSE CURRENTLY WITHOUT ACCESS KAHU INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION A WORKING TOWARDS THESE GOALS AS WELL. AND GOLF CALIFORNIA AND ON A NATIONAL BASIS. COM WHO BELIEVES THAT WE SHOULD NOT. DISMANTLED THE EXCELLENT WORK THAT SO MANY STAKEHOLDERS AND THE LEGISLATURE HAS COMPLY HAVE COMPLETED OVER THE LAST EIGHT YEARS. TO PUT IT TO MAKING CALIFORNIA'S PUBLIC AND PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP. DEVELOP INTO AN INNOVATIVE AND JUST ABOUT THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE SYSTEM. IN THE COUNTRY. BUT. WE'RE CERTAINLY WILLING AND HOPEFUL AND WANT TO WORK WITH YOU TO DEVELOP A FUTURE SOLUTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SIR. HELLO EVERYONE AND THANKS FOR THESERIES OF HEARINGS. EXCEPT FOR THE OBVIOUS MISSING ELEMENT IN THEM AND THAT WOULD BE A CERTAIN NUMBER OF HOURS SPENT ON SINGLE PAYER AS AN ECONOMIC AND AS A PATIENT CARE SYSTEM. I AM A NURSE PRACTITIONER I'VE BEEN A NURSE FOR FORTY THREE YEARS A NURSE PRACTITIONER FOR THIRTY NINE OF THOSE YEARS. AND I WILL TELL YOU THERE'S ANOTHER LITTLE SAME KIND ALIKE. AN APPLE A DAY KEEPS THE DOCTOR AWAY THAT I'D LIKE TO POINT OUT TO ALL OF YOU AND THAT IS. THE DEFINITION OF INSANITY IS DOING THE SAME THING OVER AND OVER AGAIN EXPECTING DIFFERENT RESULTS. MY ENTIRE PRACTICE LIFE HAS BEEN SPENT. PLAYING GAMES WITH TWEAKING THE SYSTEM WHICH IS ALL THAT WE HEARD ABOUT A SYSTEM THAT CANNOT WORK AND SHOULD NOT WORK. I AM A CLINICIAN I AM NOT A PROVIDER. I GIVE PEOPLE CARE NOT PRODUCT. AND MY PEOPLE WHO COME TO MY CLINIC OUR PATIENTS NOT CONSUMERS THERE'S A MARKET PARADIGM FOR HEALTHCARE THAT SIMPLY NEEDS TO GO AWAY. I'LL CONTEST ONE NUMBER THAT I HEARD TODAY AND THAT IS THE ADMINISTRATIVE COST DIFFERENCES BETWEEN PRIVATE INSURANCE. MEDICARE AND MEDICARE ADVANTAGE AND I'LL ALSO POINT OUT. WE APPARENTLY ARE WE WASTING AT LEAST SIX PERCENT OF OUR TAX DOLLARS IN MEDICARE TURNING IT OVER TO PRIVATE INSURANCE COMPANIES. TO MANAGE THE ADVANTAGE THAT WE COULD HAVE WRITTEN AN TO THE MEDICARE LAWS IN THE FIRST PLACE. THE DIFFERENCE. THAT I'M HEARING IN HEALTH AFFAIRS MAGAZINE IN THE NEW ENGLAND JOURNAL OF MEDICINE. IN MANY OTHER MEDICAL AYE AND MEDICAL ECONOMICS MAGAZINES OF INSURANCE. COST. IS TWENTY ONE PERCENT NOT ELEVEN SO IF YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT SAVING MONEY THERE'S A MUCH BIGGER AMOUNT OF IT. AND I WILL TELL YOU THAT THE SIMPLE SOLUTION HERE IS A UNIVERSAL PUBLIC SYSTEM WHERE THE. PAY THE PAYMENTS ARE MADE TO THE PEOPLE PROVIDING THE CARE AND I KNOW I'M OVER TIME I'M GONNA GO TO SEE TWO MORE SECONDS. S. B. FIVE SIXTY TWO IS WHERE YOU NEED TO START AND THAT NEEDS TO GO BACK TO THE ASSEMBLY. THERE IS NO DIFFUSE PUSH BACK IT'S SIMPLY BEING IGNORED. GOOD EVENING MY NAME IS THEO SLATER AND THE NATIONAL CHAIRPERSON FOR THE CALIFORNIA NATIONAL PARTY. SINGLE PAYER HEALTHCARE IS THE ONLY SYSTEM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CAN'T UNDERMINE WITH HIS COMMERCE POWERS LIKE THEY DO NOW WITH ERISA. THEREFORE SINGLE PAYER IS THE ONLY VIABLE VEHICLE TO PROVIDE CALIFORNIA WITH THE SORT OF COVERAGE PROVIDED BY MODERN DEMOCRACIES AROUND THE WORLD. THAT TRUMP CAN'T UNDERMINE. THE CALIFORNIA NATIONAL PARTY SUPPORTS S. B. FIVE SIX TWO AS THE WAY FORWARD FOR ADDRESSING THE NEEDS OF ALL CALIFORNIANS. HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANIES PROVIDE NO CARE TO ANYONE AND MERELY RATION CARE BY WEALTH. THE STATUS QUO IS BAD FOR CALIFORNIA AND ONLY GOOD FOR THE HUGE AND WASTEFUL CORPORATIONS WHO HOLD OUR PEOPLE HOSTAGE AND PROFIT FROM OUR SUFFERING. PLEASE PASS SB FIVE SIXTY TO NOW CALIFORNIA CAN'T AFFORD ANY FURTHER DELAY. THANK YOU. MY NAME IS DIANE AFFORDABLE. I LIVED IN CANADA OF MORE THAN TWENTY YEARS. WE RAISED OUR CHILDREN UNDER THEIR SYSTEM I HAVE SEEN SINGLE PAYER IN ACTION AND IT WORKS. WHAT? I'VE BEEN A VOLUNTEER FOR SINGLE PAYER SINCE I RETURNED FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS. WE JUST KEEP COMING BACK. BUT I LIKE HISTORY AND SO I'D LIKE TO PAINT A LITTLE PICTURE HERE WE ARE IN THIS ROOM. RIGHT NOW JUST US. AND THE BEHIND US STRETCHES HUMAN HISTORY MANY THOUSANDS OF BABY MILLIONS OF YOUR. AND THERE BEFORE US. MANY THOUSANDS AT LEAST MAYBE MUCH MORE. SO WHERE ARE WE NOW. WELL ACCORDING TO SOME OF THE ECONOMISTS I READ WE ARE LIVE THE GREATEST INEQUALITY IN WEALTH AND INCOME SINCE NINETEEN TWENTY NINE. I WANNA REPEAT THAT WE HAVE THE GREATEST INEQUALITY. IN INCOME AND WEALTH SINCE NINETEEN TWENTY NINE. THAT'S A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT SOME PEOPLE HAVING A REAL HARD TIME RIGHT NOW AND CHICO OUR STREETS HAVE SO MANY HOMELESS. AND IS OT GOING TO GET BETTER RIGHT AWAY IT MAKE IT MUCH WORSE. OKAY IN THE SIDE. THE ALSO AUTOMATION IS GOBBLING UP JOBS. MAKING. SUGGESTING IT MAY GET WORSE. TOMMY DOUGLAS WHO WAS A PRIME MINISTER OF CANADA WHEN SINGLE PAYER WAS BROUGHT IN HE IS STILL. CHOSEN AS THE MOST ADMIRABLE CANADIAN IN SURVEYS WHEN THEY RUN THESE THINGS. A SO HERE'S A LEGACY FOR US ALL. I URGE YOU TO MOVE TOWARD A UNIVERSAL NOT FOR PROFIT SINGLE PAYER. GOVERNMENT FUNDED HEALTH CARE FOR HOME. HUMAN. HELLO MY NAME'S DAVE MARIN. I'M THE DIRECTOR OF RESEARCH AND POLICY FOR THE CALIFORNIA FREEDOM COALITION AND I'M SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF THE PUBLIC OPTION TO SINGLE PAYER WORKING GROUP. SO WHEN PEOPLE TALK ABOUT SINGLE PAYER IN CALIFORNIA THERE LIKE OWE HOW ARE WE GOING TO CONTAIN COSTS HOUSE GOING TO WORK WITH OTHER COVER. LIKE NO NO WE ALREADY HAVE A. A SINGLE PAYER SYSTEM A PUBLIC SINGLE PAYER SYSTEM COST CONTROLS IN CALIFORNIA WE JUST DON'T HAVE ENOUGH CALIFORNIANS IN IT. AND TALKING WE READ THIS FACT SHEET WHICH SHOULD BE IN YOUR POCKET LAYING THE GROUNDWORK FOR SINGLE PAYER. EMERGED I'M TALKING ABOUT THAT PUBLIC MEDI CAL MANAGED CARE PLANS SO. MORE THAN NINETY PERCENT OF CALIFORNIANS ARE IN A COUNTY WITH THE PUBLIC PLAN. A A PUBLIC MANAGED CARE PLAN IS IT'S ONE THAT'S NONPROFIT AND THE PREMIER PRIMARILY DEDICATED TO MEDIC MEDIC HOW. THERE'S ALSO PRIVATE INSURERS AND MEDICARE OTHERS ALSO FEE FOR SERVICE. THE GOOD THING ABOUT THE PUBLIC PLANS IS THERE'S A MOST ONE FOR COUNTING SU KNOW WHAT THE PUBLIC PLAN IS. AND THEY WON'T GET UNDERFOOT WHEN YOU TRY TO FLIP THE SWITCH FROM A PREMIUM BE SYSTEM TO TAXPAYERS SYSTEM. THEY WANT SAY THEY WON'T USE THE PROFITS THEY'RE MAKING TO LOBBY INSTANT KILL SINGLE PAYER. SO. HOW DO YOU GET MORE PEOPLE ON A ONE OF THESE PLANTS WELL? I MEDI CAL BY IN. THE GREAT THING ABOUT AMERICA BY AND IS SPIKES IN DEMAND SAID AT THE LAST PRESENTATION YOU DON'T NEED A FEDERAL WAIVER FOR. YOU CAN SET THE PRICE TO-WHATEVER YOU WANT IT COULD BE A LITTLE BIT MORE EXPENSIVE THAN MEDI CAL IS NOW TO GET MORE MONEY INTO THE SYSTEM TO MAKE MEDICAL BETTER IF YOU HAVE MORE PEOPLE IN MEDI CAL THE PROVIDER NETWORKS GET BIGGER. PEOPLE ALREADY START TO SEE THE BENEFITS OF SINGLE PAYER SO. THEIR TWO THINGS THAT ARE REAL IMPORTANT ONE IS YOU NEED AN EMPLOYER BY SO FOR EXAMPLE. LA IS PUBLIC PLAN LA CARE. COVERS TWO MILLION PEOPLE THEY ALSO HAVE A THEY'VE BEEN UNCOVERED CALIFORNIA SINCE TWENTY THIRTEEN THROUGH ELLIE. CARE COVERED. WHICH IS GREAT IT COVERS TWENTY THOUSAND PEOPLE YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET THE SCALE YOU WANT WITHOUT AN EMPLOYER PLAN. AND THE OTHER THING IS TAKE A HARD LOOK AT THESE PRIVATE ENTITIES THAT ARE MEDI CAL. AND THERE IS A SLIGHTLY WAS CHRIS PONY SLIDE NUMBER TWELVE WHERE THEY LINE THEM ALL UP. IF YOU LOOK CLOSELY AT THAT IF YOU LOOK AT THE COUNTIES WHERE THERE'S BOTH THE PUBLIC PLAN IN A PRIVATE PLAN THERE'S THERE'S THIRTEEN COUNTIES LIKE THAT. IN ONLY FOUR DOES ANY PRIVATE PLAN BE. THE PUBLIC PLAN SO. I IT'S NOT CLEAR WHAT WE'RE DOING. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU SIR. MY NAME IS WILLIAM BRONSTON I'M A PHYSICIAN. I WAS THE MEDICAL DIRECTOR FOR TWO STATE DEPARTMENTS IN CALIFORNIA FOR THIRTY YEARS THE DEPARTMENT OF DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES IN THE DEPARTMENT WE HAVE. I BEEN AROUND A LONG TIME MAYBE TWICE AS LONG AS MANY OF YOU OUT THERE AND I AM VERY DEEPLY FAMILIAR WITH WHAT'S GOING ON AS A HEAD. OF THE PHYSICIANS FOR A NATIONAL HEALTH PROGRAM HERE. A MEMBER ORGANIZATION THAT INCLUDES TWENTY THOUSAND OF US IN THE UNITED STATES COMMITTED TO FAIRNESS AND JUSTICE AND A SINGLE PAYER. WE ARE ABSOLUTELY UNCOMPROMISING LEE COMMITTED TO KEEPING IT SIMPLE. KEEPING IT SIMPLE MEANS HAVING A SYSTEM WHERE PEOPLE CAN GO WITH NO OUT OF POCKET EXPENSES OF ANY KIND. WHICH IF THEY HAVE TO PAY ONE DOLLAR INTERFERES AND RESULTS IN OUTCOME MEASURES THAT DROP. IN GETTING THE SERVICES THEY NEED FROM ANY LICENSE CALIFORNIA PHYSICIAN OR HEALTH PROVIDER. AND GOING HOME AND HAVING THE PROVIDER BILL THE TRUST AGENCY THAT HAS BEEN CREATED IN FIVE SIXTY TWO. YOU NO THAT WE ARE IN A ELECTION YEAR. AND THIS YEAR. THE ISSUE OF SINGLE PAYER IS GOING TO BE THE GOVERNING ISSUE THAT'S GOING TO DIVIDE THE PEOPLE THAT NGUYEN FROM THE PEOPLE THAT LOSE. WE'RE IN A SITUATION WHERE THERE AREBRILLIANT BRILLIANT LEADERS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT WILL FIGHT TRUMP TO THE GROUND IF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TRIES TO BLOCK MONIES FROM US. WE HAVE THE PEOPLE POWER AND THE DOCTOR POWER. AND THE NURSE LEADERSHIP IN THIS AGENDA THAT WILL TRANSFORM THE STATE INTO A MORE DEMOCRATIC MORE HUMANE MORE PROFOUNDLY INTIMATE MORE CARING AND MERCIFUL SOCIETY. THAT'S WHAT'S AT STAKE THAT'S WHAT THE DARK MONEY DOESN'T WANT TO HAPPEN AND I HOPE THAT NONE OF YOU ARE SOMEHOW SEDUCED. BY THE DARK MONEY WE HAVE THE DATA I WANT TO THANK YOU VERY MUCH YOUR COMMITMENT AND JUST KNOW THAT THIS IS THE BEGINNING. OF THE END OF THE OLD WAY WHERE MONEY IS THE ISSUE THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT NOT THE QUALITY OF LIFE OF EVERY HUMAN BEING IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU. A THANK YOU SO MUCH I APPRECIATE IT I THINK YOU FOR THE IS INFORMATIVE HEARINGS MY NAME IS AMY HI AM SHY GUY AND THE LEGISLATIVE AND POLITICAL DIRECTOR FOR. THE CW A LOCAL NINETY ONE NINETEEN WE REPRESENT APPROXIMATELY FIFTEEN THOUSAND. RESEARCHERS AND OTHER TECHNICAL AND PROFESSIONAL EMPLOYEES WITHIN THE TEN CAMPUSES AND FIVE MEDICAL CENTERS OF THE UC SYSTEM. A TWO THOUSAND WORKERS THAT ARE AND. COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND THREE NATIONAL LABORATORIES. I WOULD JUST LIKE TO MENTION THE REASONS WHY ALTHOUGH WE HAVE ENJOYED THESE INFORMATIVE HEARINGS WHY WE THINK THAT WE ARE STILL IN FAVOR OF SB FIVE SIXTY WERE DEFINITELY IN FAVOR OF S. B. FIVE SIX TWO AND WOULD ENJOY HEARING ABOUT THAT TOPIC. HEALTH CARE OF COURSE IS A FUNDAMENTAL HUMAN RIGHT. AND WE HAVE KNOWN THAT SINCE THE UN DECLARATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS IN NINETEEN NINETY FOUR SO IT'S BEEN AWHILE. AND I WE WOULD LIKE THE REAFFIRMATION THAT HEALTCARE IS A FUNDAMENTAL HUMAN RIGHT. AYE AS SARAH FLUX AND STATED THE BEST AND SIMPLER SWAYED TO REMOVE HEALTH CARE FROM THE BARGAINING TABLE IS SINGLE PAYER AND WE ACTUALLY ARE AT THE BARGAINING TABLE WITH YOU SEE RIGHT NOW IT WOULD BE WONDERFUL IF WE COULD REMOVE THAT AS A BARRIER TAKE REACHING AN AGREEMENT. EDUCATION IS ALSO A FUNDAMENTAL HUMAN RIGHT AND WE DID ENJOY THE CONVERSATION ABOUT. THAT COST OF ATTAINING A MEDICAL DEGREE BECAUSE WE SHOULD REMOVE TUITION AND FEES IN MEDICAL EDUCATION FROM THE HEALTH CARE COST EQUATION TO INCREASE PROVIDERS AND TOTAL AND DIVERSITY OF PROVIDERS SPECIFICALLY. WE SHOULD PAY FOR THE FREE TUITION AND FEES. MEDICAL EDUCATION FROM THE BILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF LEAST THIRTY SIX BILLION DOLLAR PER YEAR SAVINGS FROM THE GREEDY FOR PROFIT HEALTH INSURANCE CORPORATIONS THAT ARE LEECHING OFF OF OUR LIVES. SO WE SURE WOULD APPRECIATE YOUR CONSIDERATION AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. HI MY NAME IS CAROLYN DOWN AMID A CAMPAIGN ORGANIZER WITH A HEALTHY CALIFORNIA CAMPAIGN AND I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT I'VE BEEN IT'S ALL OF THESE HEARINGS AND THEY'VE BEEN VERY INFORMATIVE. BUT I ALWAYS WALK AWAY WITH THE SAME CONCLUSION AND MAYBE I'M A LITTLE BIASED THAT S. B. FIVE SIX TWO ANSWERS A LOT OF THE QUESTIONS THAT ARE BROUGHT UP HERE. AND I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR. DEEP QUESTIONS AND I KNOW THAT TO MANY OF YOU HAVE. COME TO SOME OF THE SIMILAR CONCLUSIONS THAT MANY OF US HAVE THAT SINGLE PAYER IS THE ANSWER TO. UP EMPLOYEE ISSUES EMPLOYER ISSUES THE. COST CONTAINMENT SO. TRANSPARENCY ALL THE THINGS THAT EVERYBODY WANTS TO NIBBLE AROUND THE EDGES SINGLE PAYER ACTUALLY GETS RIGHT TO IT SO I WANT TO ASK YOU FIRST OF ALL I WANT TO. ASK ABOUT YOUR COMMITMENT YOU MADE TO THE CALIFORNIA NURSES ASSOCIATION THAT S. B. FIVE SIX TWO WOULD BE A PANEL. I'M HOPING YOU WILL FULFILL THAT COMMITMENT THAT THE NEXT HEARING. AND I ALSO WANT TO ASK YOU TO GET SPEAKER RENDON TO MOVE THIS BILL TO THE FLOOR BECAUSE AS SOMEONE STATED EARLIER. THIS COMMITTEE CANNOT LEGISLATE YOU'VE BEEN DONE A GREAT JOB INFORMING US BUT THIS COMMITTEE CANNOT LEGISLATE WE NEED. S. B. FIVE SIX TWO IN THE HEALTH COMMITTEE DOCTOR WOULD. AND THEN IN THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE AND THEN TO THE ASSEMBLY FLOOR PLEASE DO THAT THANK YOU. MY MY NAME'S KEITH MCALLEN. I'M A PHYSICIAN ASSISTANT I WAS MOST RECENTLY AT A FAMILY PRACTICE DOWN IN SALINAS. A COUPLE OF POINTS HERE NOT REGARDING A GOVERNOR OUT SHUMLIN AYE IT MAKES NO SENSE AT ALL TO SUGGEST THAT WE PROVE THAT WE CAN CONTAIN COST BEFORE IMPLEMENTING SINGLE PAYER SINGLE PAYER IS THE MECHANISM. OF COST CONTAINMENT R. HE HAS GREAT THINGS TO TEACH US AND WE SHOULD LISTEN TO ON THAT ON THAT POINT. HE'S OFF BASE. DOCTOR RANDALL IF A REGULAR THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BRINGING UP THE TERM UNDER INSURED IN SALINAS I HAD MANY PATIENTS WHO WERE ON. THAT NEEDED HEALTH INSURANCE THEY WERE UNINSURED AND I HAD MANY ELDERLY ON MEDICARE THE BULK OF MY PATIENT PANEL WAS EVERYBODY IN THE MIDDLE THAT'S CALLED UNINSURED. WANTED THINGS WERE NOT REALLY APPRECIATING IS THAT EMPLOYMENT BASED HEALTH CARE INSURANCE IS A DIMINISHING BENEFIT OVER TIME. AREN'T YOU CAN GO TO P. NH P. DOT ORG AND LOOK AT THE DATA I'LL BE HAPPY TO PASS THAT ALONG TO YOU. YEAH MEDICARE FOR ALL HER FORTY SEVENTH IN THE NATION IN REIMBURSEMENTS. THE LAST PANEL CINDY MAN SPOKE OF MEDICARE FOR ALL THAT'S THAT'S JUST ABSURD THAT'S AN ABSURD PROPOSITION TO PUT FORTH. REGARDING ABOUT TALKING ACCESS TALKING ACCESS IS NOT TALKING ABOUT HEALTHCARE REFORM. THE OPIOID EPIDEMIC. AB WHAT ARE WE TALKING ABOUT NOBODY'S TALKING ABOUT PAIN MANAGEMENT REFORM KNOW WHERE ACROSS THE UNITED STATES. WORKERS COMP NOT BEING DISCUSSED IN MY SHOULD BRING IN SINGLE PAYER. LONG TERM SUPPORT SERVICES NOBODY'S TALKING ABOUT FIXING THAT. AND PUSHED BACK AGAINST THE DIABETES TSUNAMI THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN WHEN OUNCES OF PREVENTION ARE DISCARDED BECAUSE THERE'S MONEY IN PARENTS OF CARE. AND THEN THE THAT THE BIG THE BIG SIGH THING THAT I THINK WE ALL NEED TO THINK ABOUT AND I THINK OF THE UNDERWRITERS WHO WERE JUST TOP HERE NOW. THE BUSINESS LEADERS WHO KNOW WHAT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT REGARDING HEALTH CARE REFORM SAY PRIVATE INSURANCE BRINGS NOTHING TO THE HEALTH CARE TABLE EXCEPT COST. THANK YOU. FOR ARE NOT PURPLE OVERTHROW YOU KNOW. PRACTICED EMERGENCY MEDICINE FOR THIRTY UNITS WHICH ARE PROVINCIALLY FIGURED OUT WHAT WAS A MONUMENT TO THE FAILURE OF PREVENTATIVE MEDICINE. IN LOOKING AT THE LARGER PICTURE OF OUR WORK AND SINCE THIS IS A POLITICAL ORGANIZATION. ONE MIGHT REVIEW WHAT HAPPENED TO WINSTON CHURCHILL. HE WAS A WAR HERO. HE WAS WELL REGARDED BY THE. ENGLISH PUBLIC. HE LOST THE ELECTION AFTER THE SECOND WORLD WAR. AND YOU KNOW WHAT THE ISSUE WAS. HEALTHCARE. THEY REJECTED HIM. THE HERO FOR THE SECOND WORLD WAR WAS REJECTED. FIRMLY. BECAUSE HE DIDN'T SUPPORT. HEALTHCARE. SO YOU MIGHT. INCIDENT THAT. CONSIDERING. HELLO DOCTOR RANDY. IT'S ARE RECALL CHICKENS HERE I AM A DISABILITY RIGHTS ADVOCATES DISABILITY RIGHTS ACTIVIST AND DISABILITY RIGHTS EXTREMIST I'M ALSO A MEMBER AND SECRETARY OF CAPITAL PEOPLE FIRST. WHICH IS AN ORGANIZATION RUN BY AND FOR PEOPLE WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES HERE IN THE GREATER SACRAMENTO COUNTY AREA. I'M A CONSTITUENT OF SENATOR JIM NIELSEN IS BUT A CONSTITUENT OF ASSEMBLYMAN KIM COOLIES CAN POLICE. WITH TWO MINUTES ALL GIVEN FOR ME TO SPEAK I DON'T KNOW WHERE TO START BUT I WILL SAY THIS. PRESIDENT TRUMP HIMSELF ALONG WITH. HIS REPUBLICAN ALLIES IN CONGRESS. AND IN THIS LEGISLATURE AS WELL AS EVERYONE WHO VOTED FOR THEM. WILL NOT. DO NOT WANT TO SEE. AN INCREASE IN THE RATES TO MEDICAID OR MEDICARE. AND BY THE WAY MEDICAID MEDICARE AL IS CALIFORNIA'S MEDICAID PROGRAM AND WITH THAT SAID. GOVERNOR JERRY BROWN DOES NOT WANT TO RAISE THE RATES HE DOES NOT WANT TO TO SEE THE RATES RAISED FOR MEDI CAL PROVIDERS HE WANTS TO KEEP IT AS IS. THAT'S WHAT NUMBER ONE NUMBER TWO. OF WITH THAT SAID SENSE OUR PRESIDENT AND EVERYONE WHO EVERYONE IN THIS LEGISLATURE WHO VOTED FORUM AS WELL AS PRIVATE CITIZENS WHO VOTED FOR HIM. DON'T WANT TO EXPAND ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE THE WAY TO GET TO UNIVERSAL SINGLE PAIR HEALTH CARE IN THIS STATE S. B. FIVE SIXTY TWO. AND BY PASSING HIM WOULD BE TO AND THIS IS ALSO A GOOD WAY TO RAISE THE MEDIC CAL RATES. IS WHY NOT YOU KNOW HOW WE FUND K. TWELVE AND AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES IN THE STATE WHY NOT DO THE SAME WITH. MEDICAL SCHOOLS NOT JUST POSITIONS BUT ALSO PHARMACISTS SOCIAL WORKERS AND PSYCHOLOGISTS AND PSYCHIATRISTS NOW. I HEARD THE TERM UNDER INSURED MENTION SEVERAL TIMES DURING THIS HEARING. AND. SORRY I'M A LITTLE BIT NERVOUS BECAUSE I FEEL PRESSURED TO STOP BUT. WHAT I HEARD I HAVE MEDIC CAL AND MEDICARE BY THE WAY IF YOU HAVE MEDI CAL AND MEDICARE? LIKE ME NOT ONLY IT'S BECAUSE YOUR ELDERLY BUT BECAUSE YOU'RE DISABLED LIKE I AM. EVEN IF YOU HAVE MEDICARE AND MEDICAID ALWAYS MEDICARE BEING THE PRIMARY INSURER YOU'RE STILL UNDER INSURED. SO THE TAKE TOWARD THE TAKE HOME POINT THAT I FORGOT TO BRING UP AT THE LAST HEARING THAT WHICH WE HAD A BROWN THE TAIL END OF OCTOBER OF LAST YEAR. TWENTY SEVENTEEN THAT WE NEED TO. AS A WAY TO FUND SINGLE PAYER HEALTHCARE AND AS A WAY TO INCREASE. UP PROVIDER RATES TO ALLOW MORE DOCTORS IN THE STATE TO TAKE MEDI CAL AS WELL AS PSYCHOLOGISTS AND SOCIAL WORKERS IN DENISON CHIROPRACTORS. AND NOT WE NEED TO FIND OUR MEDICAL SCHOOLS THE WAY WE FIND K. TWELVE AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES JUST LIKE WHAT WE DO WITH. PROP NINETY EIGHT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU RICH TO A CERTAIN PUBLIC APPROVAL.
