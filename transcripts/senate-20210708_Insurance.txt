THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE SENATE INSURANCE COMMITTEE HI THIS IS A BILL THAT WE HEARD IN THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE A FEW WEEKS AGO AND DO WANT TO THANK THE INSURANCE COMMITTEE STAFF AS WELL THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE STAFF WORKING WITH US TO INCORPORATE AMENDMENTS WE THINK MOVE THIS ISSUE FORWARD. THIS IS RELATED TO THE ISSUE WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT CALIFORNIA RACIAL JUSTICE AND RACIAL RECONCILIATION AND OUR POLICY SPECIFICALLY RELATED TO HOUSING IN THESE- RACIAL COVENANTS OR ON HOMES FOR DECADES IN CALIFORNIA THAT RESTRICTED HOMEOWNERSHIP AND- WE AGAIN WE DO HAVE WORK WITH AMENDMENTS WITH WITH THE COMMITTEES AND BY DOING SOME WORK WITH THE- PARTIES AND STAKEHOLDERS ON ALL SIDES AND WE THINK REMOVED ALL OPPOSITION WE'RE GONNA HEAR FROM ONE OF THE GROUPS HERE IN A BIT. AS WE KNOW THESE RACIALLY RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS WERE PRIVATE AGREEMENTS BARRING NON WHITES- AND OTHER INDIVIDUALS FROM OCCUPYING OR OWNING PROPERTIES THROUGHOUT OUR NATION HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND A KEY ELEMENT. OF OUR SEGREGATIONIST POLICIES OF THE EARLY TWENTIETH CENTURY. NUMBER EXAMPLES THROUGHOUT OUR COMMUNITIES- I COULD MEMBER I TOLD THIS THIS THIS BODY A FEW WEEKS AGO THE- THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE WHEN I BUY MY OWN HOME. OUR REALTOR CAME TO ME AND SAID I KNOW YOU'RE FROM A MIXED RACE FAMILY BUT THIS IS GOING TO REALLY INSIGHT TO HAVE A LOOK AT PAGE. FIFTY SEVEN OR SOMETHING AND SEE THAT SAYS YOU ONLY HEAR ONLY PEOPLE THAT CAN BUY THESE HOMES ARE WHITES AND I WAS FLOORED THAT THESE WORDS WERE STILL IN THE DEEDS OF HOMES. LATER THEY WERE STRUCK DOWN BY THE SUPREME COURT BUT THEY STILL EXIST IN THE STING IS STILL THERE FOR MANY PEOPLE WHEN THEY SEE THESE ARE BY THEIR HOMES. SO WITH THIS BILL IT'S REALLY TWO FOLD IT'S GOING TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR HOMEOWNERS AN INDIVIDUAL TO TAKE PROACTIVE STEPS TO REMOVE THEM. AND ALSO WE'RE GOING TO ESTABLISH A PROCESS- WHERE WE CAN TAKE A LOOK AT ALL OF THESE DEEDS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA HAVE BEEN STUDIED TO IDENTIFY MAPPED IN SUFFOLK SUBSEQUENTLY. REDACTED THIS IS AN IMPORTANT STEP OF WRITING A PRIOR WRONG. IT'S NOT GOING TO BRING AN ANSWER TO ALL THE ISSUES AS FAR AS- RACIAL HOUSING POLICIES BUT IT'S AN IMPORTANT STEP. IN AND- WITH ME TODAY ARE TWO INDIVIDUALS I'D LIKE TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK ON THIS MEASURE THANK. I THANK YOU AND AGAIN BEFORE WE CONTINUE I WANT TO MAKE SURE WE MAKE THIS ANNOUNCEMENT AND AGAIN DUE TO THE CONSTRAINTS REGARDING THE LENGTH OF THE HEARINGS EACH WEEK TERM INTO TWO TIME LIMITS. AT THIS TIME EACH SIDE WILL BE PERMITTED AN EQUAL AMOUNT OF TIME NOT TO EXCEED THREE MINUTES EACH ALL OTHERS WISHING TO TESTIFY MESSING WITH THEIR COMMENTS TO THEIR NAME AFFILIATION AND POSITION ON THE MEASURE. WE WILL MOVE UP FIRST WITH- JAMIE LEWIS. I BELIEVE THAT YOU MAY PROCEED WHEN YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU THIS IS JAMIE LEWIS. THANK YOU CHAIR RUBIO AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR ALLOWING ME TO SPEAK TODAY IN SUPPORT AT EIGHTY FOURTEEN SIXTY SIX AGAIN MY NAME IS JAMIE LEWIS. AND I'M A RESIDENT IN TENNESSEE BUT BUT CALIFORNIA. I MOVED INTO WHAT'S CALLED THE IN HOME DISTRICT AND FAMILIES THE BEST PHONE IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN. WHILE I WAS PREACHING PURCHASING MY HOME I WAS FILLING OUT THE FACT PEOPLE WORK MY REALTOR SHARED WITH ME. AND MY FUTURE HOME COVENANTS CONDITIONS AND RESTRICTIONS. READING THROUGH THESE I WAS APPALLED TO FIND A PROVISION PROHIBITING ANYONE OF A NON CAUCASIAN RACE. FROM OCCUPYING OR OWNING THE HOME AND LIKE THEY WERE AT THE MEXICAN. READING THROUGH THESE I AM SORRY I KNEW THAT I WANTED TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THE C. C. N. R. BUT I WASN'T SURE WHAT. THEN IN THE WAKE OF GEORGE FLOYD MURDER I HAD A MOMENT OF RECKONING WHERE IT BECAME ABUNDANTLY CLEAR. THAT THE RACIST LANGUAGE IN NINETY THREE IN OUR IN THE MURDER OF BLACK AND BROWN PEOPLE AT THE HANDS OF THE POLICE. ARE ALL A PART OF AMERICA'S MULTI FACETED RACIST PAST AND PRESENT. THIS IS WHEN I BEGAN THE PROCESS OF HAVING THAT LANGUAGE REMAINS. I STARTED SPEAKING TO NEIGHBORS ON EVERYTHING THAT THESE COVENANTS ARE PERVASIVE THROUGHOUT THE N. HOME DISTRICT. DESPITE KNOWING YOU HAVE AN INTERNAL LAUNDRY LEGAL OR ENFORCEABLE IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO UNSEE SOMETHING. OUTWARDLY PREJUDICE. THE COMPOSITION OF MY NEIGHBORHOOD IT'S THE DIRECT PRODUCT AT THE C. T. AND OURS. WITH 88% OF PEOPLE LIVING IN HELLO BEING WHITE. FOURTEEN AND I WERE ABLE TO GET LANGUAGE REMOVED. ENGAGING AN UNCOMFORTABLE BUT NECESSARY CONVERSATIONS AROUND THE COMPOUNDING IMPACT THE CCN OURS. HOW THEY BARRED BLACK FAMILIES FROM ACCESSING WEALTH APPRECIATED OVER GENERATIONS OF HOMEOWNERSHIP- ME REMOVAL OF THESE CABINETS IT'S A SMALL STEP IN ADDRESSING THE MUCH LARGER IMPACT SYSTEMIC RACISM. HOWEVER IT IS AN IMPORTANT STEP IN ELEVATING THE MUCH NEEDED CONVERSATION AND A KNOWLEDGE MEANT THAT SYSTEMIC RACISM AND PRIVILEGE. ADMITTED THE CCN OURS UNDERSCORES HOW MUCH WORK STILL NEEDS TO BE DONE TO PROVIDE RACIAL EQUITY IN THE UNITED STATES I. JUST WANTED TO REMIND I'M SORRY TO INTERRUPT YOU HAVE A MINUTE AND A HALF AND I BELIEVE YOU HAVE A SECOND WITNESS WAITING IN THE QUEUE JUST AS A REMINDER SORRY FOR THE INTERRUPTION. OF COURSE.

THAT REVERBERATE IN OUR COMMUNITIES BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT SEGREGATION. BUILT IN AND BAKED INTO OUR HOUSING POLICIES. IT'S WHY WE SEE SUCH A- DOT- YOU KNOW TO CONTINUE I DISCRIMINATION IN TERMS OF HOW THEY ACCESS IN OUR COMMUNITIES ALL HOME IS AN ORGANIZATION THAT FOCUS ON FOCUSES ON REGIONAL SOLUTIONS TO ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS. AND HOUSING INSECURITY AND HOMELESSNESS IS DIRECTLY IMPACTED BY THESE TYPES OF PRACTICES WE BLACK AND BROWN PEOPLE WORK FROM PROHIBITED FROM GENERATING RESOURCES ASSETS AND WEALTH IN COMMUNITIES THESE TYPES OF COVENANT ARE THE REASONS WHY OUR COMMUNITIES CONTINUE TO STRUGGLE. AGAINST PROPORTIONATELY STRUGGLE WITH HOMELESSNESS AND HOUSING INSECURITY IF YOU LOOK AT OUR REDLINING MAPS IN OUR OVER CONCENTRATION OF POVERTY IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IT IS NO COINCIDENCE THAT THESE MAPS ONLINE. THAT WE CONTINUE TO HAVE DISPARATE IMPACT ACCESS.

THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS ROB GROWS UNDER THE COUNTY RECORDER'S ASSOCIATION AND THAT TWEENER POSITION- THIS IS A GOOD BILL IN A VERY VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE AND WE THINK THE DILEMMA FOR RUNNING IT- ONE OF THE AREAS THAT WE ARE STILL WORKING OUT HOW TO DEAL WITH FUNDING MECHANISM FOR THE TASK FORCE- WE ENCOURAGE YOU SOME AMBER AND ACTIVE COMMITTEE. TO MAKE THE FEE ON THE RECORDED DOCUMENTS APPLICABLE TO ALL DOCUMENTS THE CURRENT LANGUAGE IN THE BILL IS FAIRLY AGGRESSIVE ENOUGH THAT HE WOULD BE APPLICABLE TO AFFIDAVIT THE DEATH MECHANICS GOING INTO DOCUMENTS LIKE THAT BUT IT WOULD NOT APPLY TO REAL ESTATE TRANSACTIONS SUCH AS THE PURCHASE OF A MULTI MILLION DOLLAR HOMES.

THANK YOU MODERATOR AHA NOW HAVING HEARD FROM ALL TESTIMONY I WILL NOT BRING IT BACK TO DISCUSSION TO THE MEMBERS IN THE FOR ANYBODY WISHING. TO COMMENT I WILL GO TO SENATOR ARCHULETA YOU MAY PROCEED THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I CERTAINLY WOULD LIKE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS VERY VERY IMPORTANT BILL FORWARD- IT IS ABOUT TIME. IT'S A RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS CONDITIONS THAT ON PROPERTIES AND OBVIOUSLY THAT GO BACK IN AND AFFECT SO MANY MINORITIES ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND BUT FOR THE BENEFIT OF ALL CALIFORNIANS ACROSS THE BOARD I THINK FOURTEEN A. B. FOURTEEN SIXTY SIX IS THE RIGHT BILL THERE'S A COUPLE OF THINGS THAT I WOULD LIKE TO JUST POINT OUT. THAT I AM NOW IN TOTAL SUPPORT- HOWEVER I DO WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR- FOR THE AMENDED SAFE TAKEN AND HOPEFULLY THEY CAN CONTINUE TO LOOK AT. THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE REALTOR AND OR BROKERS AND AGENTS. HAVING TO- PUT THEMSELVES IN POSITION TO DEAL WITH THE R. C. M. FORM. WHICH IS THE- THE RESTRICTIVE COVENANT MODIFICATION FORM THAT I DON'T THINK THE REALTOR SHOULD HAVE THAT RESPONSIBILITY NOW THAT THERE'SA TASK FORCE THAT WILL BE WORKING TO ACHIEVE THE GOALS. OF THE LOOP ELIMINATING- THESE ITEMS ON THE DEEDS SO CONSEQUENTLY HOPEFULLY THE AUTHOR CAN WORK WITH THAT AND MAKE THAT PART OF THEIR AMENDMENTS IN THE FUTURE BECAUSE I KNOW THE- CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS. IS ALSO LOOKING IN THAT DIRECTION AND IF- HAVE SUPPORTED THE BILL NOW BUT WITH THE CHANGES I THINK WOULD BE FULLY FULLY COMPLETE AND I DO ASK FOR AN EYEFUL. THANK YOU SENATOR HATCH LETTER WILL NOW MOVE OVER TO SENATOR WEBSITE YOU MAY PROCEED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I ALSO WANT TO THANK YOU ALL FOR MAKING STUFF AVAILABLE IN DISCUSSING THE BUILDING. HI I HAD SOME CONCERNS CONCERNS WITH THIS BILL JUST SIMPLY IN REMOVING INFORMATION THAT CAN BE USED TO- CONTINUE TO PROTECT HOMEBUYERS FROM DISCRIMINATION- YOU KNOW I KIND OF A LIKE CANADA CAN TOO IF YOU REMOVE INFORMATION ABOUT A CRIME YOU'RE YOU'RE GOING INTO- A INTO THE SCENE OF A CRIME AND REMOVING FINGERPRINTS SYSTEM- AN OFFENSE THAT A CONCERT OCCURRED IN HISTORY. AND THE AUTHOR SHE HEARD ME THAT- THAT IS NOT THE CASE WITH THIS BILL I HAVE ONE LAST QUESTION THAT'S JUST A- ONE LAST THING I DIDN'T ASK IT AND- MY QUESTION IS REGARDING IF SOMEBODY. SOMEHOW LOOKS AT THIS AS A POINT OF PRIDE AND SAID YOU KNOW I. MIEI OF PEOPLE FROM MY COMMUNITY COULDN'T LIVE HERE IN THE PAST BUT NOW I CAN. CHOOSE TO LEAVE THAT INFORMATION IS IT IS IT OPTIONAL THAT SOMEBODY COULD APPLY TO HAVE IT REMOVED OR IS IT WILL IT BE REMOVED FOM ALL PROPERTIES WHEN THE CHANGE CHANGE HANDS. SO INDIVIDUALS CAN DO IT ON THEIR OWN RIGHT NOW TO REMOVE IT OKAY BUT WHEN THEY DO REMOVE IT IT'S STILL ON THE BACK DEED WITH THE COUNTY IT'S KIND OF LIKE WHAT I SAID IF YOU PULL UP A BILL TODAY THAT'S BEEN AMENDED YOU SEE THE CURRENT VERSION YOU CAN GO LOOK AT THE MASSIVE CHANGES WITHOUT YOUR BILL PEOPLE COULD REMOVE RESTRICTIVE COVENANT LANGUAGE FROM THE ORIGINAL DATE CORRECT THEY CAN DO TODAY AND THE FACT THAT HALF OF THE BILL. WE WANT TO MAKE IT EASIER WAY THERE WAS A PRIOR BILL ABOUT TEN YEARS AGO WHICH ALLOWS PEOPLE TO DO IT IN ONE COUNTY IS DIFFERENT THE OTHER COUNTIES SO IT'S NOT COMPLICATED HER FROM THE FIRST WITNESS THEY CAN DO IT BUT IT'S NOT ALWAYS A MISSING WAS PROCESS SO WE WANT TO DO TWO THINGS ONE MAKE IT SO IT'S- CUT OUT THE RED TAPES YOU OUGHT TO GET MULTIPLE NOTARIES TO DO IT ON YOUR OWN AND WE WAIVE THE FEES FOR THAT AND WE'VE AGREED TO THAT OKAY THE SECOND THING IS THERE'S MASSES THAT DON'T EVEN KNOW ABOUT. IN THE FIRST PLACE SO THAT PART OF THIS BILL IS THAT WE WOULD CREATE THIS FIND WE WOULD IDENTIFY AND MAP THEM AND THEN WE CAN REMOVE THEM AT LARGE SLOTS BUT TO YOUR POINT WE CAN UNDERSTAND WHERE THEY'RE AT AND MAYBE HAVE PUBLIC POLICY TO PUT MORE RESOURCES IN AREAS WHICH DID HAVE- A CONCENTRATION OF THESE CABINS BUT IF AN INDIVIDUAL WANTED TO SEE THAT STILL. THAT RECORD WOULD STILL EXISTS FOR ETERNITY THEY COULD GO AND FIND IT AT THE COUNTY RECORDS AND HAVE THAT STUFF SO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS THAT THEY CAN APPLY FOR THIS OPTIONALLY CONTINUING IT GOING INTO THE FUTURE IS NOT GONNA REMOVE BE REMOVED AUTOMATICALLY. WILL STILL BE AN OPTION OF THE BUYER- IT DID THIS PART HOW BEEN DETERMINED YET SO WHEN WE HAVE THIS FUN IN THIS FEE THAT PAYS INTO IT WE GO AND MAP ALL THESE ONE NIGHT ONE THING THAT I THINK THAT THAT WE WOULD WANT TO DO IS CLICK REMOVE A MALL IN MASS LIKE A CERTAIN AREA AND SOME PART OF SAN DIEGO MAYBE THERE'S A COMMUNITY THERE WITH THREE THOUSAND HOMES AND THEY ALL HAVE I- BUT I GUESS WHAT YOUR POINT IS IT WOULD AFFECT INDIVIDUAL WANTED TO. SOMEHOW SEE THAT AND BE ABLE TO SORT BY PRICE HEY I OVERCOME ALL THIS IN THE PAST FIFTY YEARS I WAS ABLE TO BUY THIS HOUSE ON A HILL AND HERE WE ARE TODAY- THE POINT I WAS TRYING TO MAKE IS THAT THEY WOULD STILL BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY THAT RESTRICTIVE DEED BECAUSE IT WOULD STILL BE AND LIKE THAT ESSENTIALLY BACK TO BACK AT THE AT THE COUNTY OFFICES AND MY SECOND QUESTION IS REGARDING THE KIND RECORDERS AND AMENDMENTS THAT DO WERE YOU AWARE. THAT THEY HAD SOME CONCERNS REGARDING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF FEES IS THAT SOMETHING THAT JUST THAT JUST POPPED UP OR WERE YOU AWARE OF THAT YES SIR IF YOU RECALL I THINK THREE YEARS AGO WE HAD A BIG BILL BY THE PRO TEM CHARGING A FEE ON ON REAL ESTATE TRANSFERS TO PROVIDE MONEY FOR HOUSING THE ENERGY NUMBER IN THAT WE HAD WE HAD WE'RE WE ARE NEARING THAT POLICY THAT'S ONE ONE ONE OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE REALTORS ANOTHER SYSTEM HERE WE HAVE THAT- THE RECORDERS HAVE A DIFFERENT OPINION ON THAT. WE'RE STILL TRYING TO RECONCILE THAT SO WE'RE STILL OPEN MY QUESTION WAS WHAT YOU WERE WERE YOU AWARE OF THAT OR SYSTEM THAT WAS BROUGHT UP TODAY NOW THAT WE WERE WE'VE BEEN AWARE THAT THE SHE FOR SO YOU'RE JUST NOT AN AGREEMENT WHERE THE WHERE THEY'RE COMING FROM TERMS OF THEIR AMENDMENT CORRECT WRIST YEAH THERE'S DIFFERENCES OF OPINION SOME OF THE OTHER GROUPS THAT ITHAT TESTIFIED THAT REMOVER OPPOSITE IN SUPPORT NOW THEY ACTUALLY LIKE THAT PROVISION WHICH WE HAVE A OKAY A DIFFERENTIAL FEE STRUCTURE BASED UPON WHAT WAS IN THE PRETENDS BILL FOR THAT. THE HOUSING OKAY VERY WELL- ALL SPORTSBOOK TODAY WHICH LIKE TO HAVE THE METAL ON THE BILL THANK YOU. IS THERE ANYBODY ELSE WISHING I WILL GO BACK TO SENATOR ARCHULETA. YES MAY I WANTED TO CHECK WITH YOU AUTHORED WE'RE ON THE- PLANE HERE THAT- WITH WHAT I'VE JUST HEARD FROM MY COLLEAGUE. THAT IN FACT THE REMOVAL ACROSS THE BOARD. IS GOING TO HAPPEN WITH THIS- TASK FORCE. BUT AGAIN I EMPHASIZED. THAT THE REALTOR SHOULD BE REMOVED FROM ANY RESPONSIBILITY. AND PUTTING THE RCM FORM TOGETHER AND BEING RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT. ARE YOU- YES I DON'T WANT TO BE ABLE TO WORK WITH US ON THAT YEAH THAT IS. DEFINITELY PART OF THE BILL THAT'S PART OF THE AMENDMENT WE ALREADY TALKED YES. VERY GOOD THANK YOU MANAGER. THANK YOU- IF ANY MEMBER WISHES TO SPEAK PLEASE RAISE YOUR HAND AS IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO SEE YOU I DON'T SEE ANY OTHER HANDS UP. I WE WILL- WELL FIRST OF ALL I WANTED TO SAY THANK YOU TO THE AUTHOR FOR ALSO BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND I UNDERSTAND. MY APOLOGIES TO THE TWEENER IS SUCH AN INTERESTING POSITION TO BE IN. A BUT I DO UNDERSTAND THAT- THE AUTHOR IS WILL CONTINUE THE CONVERSATIONS OUT NOT ONLY WITH THE COUNTY RECORDER'S OFFICE BUT- BUT THE REALTORS AND DIES SO I WANT TO THANK HIM FOR THAT TIME WITH THAT. WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. THANK YOU THIS ITEM THIS IS A PROBLEM WE ALL REALIZE IS THEY'RE- HAVING THE REMEDY TO ADDRESS THIS IS- CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT IS BEEN ELUSIVE- FORMER ASSEMBLY MEMBER HECTOR DILATORY. WHICH I THINK- REPRESENTS THE SAME AREAS MR ARCH ALETTA AND THAT. SOUTH PART OF LA COUNTY. TRY THIS TEN YEARS AGO- WE DID NOT SUCCEED. THIS IS NOT A NEW ISSUE BUT I THINK YOU KNOW IN THIS AREA WERE AT LIKE THE WITNESS QUOTE FROM SAN LUIS OBISPO. WE'RE TAKING A HARD LOOK AT THESE THINGS I THINK WE WANT TO. PRESERVE HISTORY BUT ALSO LOOK AT OURSELVES AND THINK HOW CAN WE- MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE- RACIALLY SOUND HOUSING POLICIES THIS IS NOT A PANACEA. IT'S NOT GOING TO MAKE.
