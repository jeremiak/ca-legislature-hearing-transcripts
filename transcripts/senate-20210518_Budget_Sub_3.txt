GREAT BOB SO AS ARE AS I THINK ALL OF US HAVE BEEN TRACKING- WHEN GOVERNOR NEWSOM CAME INTO OFFICE THE PLAN- EVEN BEFORE I TOOK THE POSITION AS HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES SECRETARY. WAS TO CONSIDER. MOVING THE DEPARTMENT OF JUVENILE JUSTICE OUT OF CDCR INTO HELPING HUMAN SERVICES AS A DEPARTMENT. OF YOUTH AND COMMUNITY RESTORATION- THE CONCEPT THERE WAS TO REALLY BUILD UP. A PLAN TO FOCUS ON YOUTH DEVELOPMENT YOU'VE HEALTH FOCUS ON THE SERVICES WITHIN THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY BROADLY ALL OF OUR DEPARTMENTS THAT IT COULD AID NOT JUST IN PROGRAMMING IN DJJ FACILITIES. BUT ALSO IN THE WORKS TO FACILITATE COMMUNITY PROGRAMS UPON REENTRY AND EVEN BEFORE- INVOLVEMENT IN THE JUSTICE SYSTEM WITH DIVERSION BOB BILL TIME I'VE BEEN PRACTICES THAT HAVE BANNED OF ALL BEING IN CALIFORNIA FOR QUITE SOME YEARS ACROSS THE NATION IN FACT. THE FOCUS ON WHAT I'VE ALWAYS LIKED TO CALL A CARE FIRST SIR THIS IS FIRST MODEL. FARM TO THE PANDEMIC- THE PLAN TO CREATE A DEPARTMENT- WAS- SHOULD SHELVE TO SIMPLY IN LIEU OF AND AN APPROACH WHERE- WAS INITIALLY THE- YOUNG PEOPLE ACT. FIVE DJJ FACILITIES NOW PROPOSED TO BE MOVED BACK TO THEIR HOME COUNTIES- HANDED BUILDING- PROGRAMS WITHIN BOTH PROBATION FACILITIES BUT ALSO. CONTINUING TO FOCUS ON BUILDING UP THOSE COMMUNITY PROGRAMS AND SERVICES SO TODAY WE PROPOSE IN THE MAY REVISE AN EXPANSION OF WHAT WAS THE JANUARY PROPOSAL- WHERE IN THAT OFFICE OF YOUTH AND COMMUNITY RESTORATION AT HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY. WOULD BE BUILT OUT. WITH OF COURSE A DIRECTOR AND W. UNDER THAT DIRECT. BUT NOW MOVES FROM- SEVEN VISIT UP TO THIRTY POSSESS. AS WELL AS SOME- RESOURCE TO HELP US. THE IN THE COMMUNITY I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT IT'S A REAL PRIVILEGE TO BE ABLE TO PRESENT THIS PROJECT I THINK. THERE IS SUCH A VALUE I'VE SEEN IT FIRST HAND IN MY WORK IN LOS ANGELES BEFORE COMING TO THE STATE THE ABILITY TO WORK ACROSS BOTH COUNTY AND LOCAL PARTNERS ON- PUBLIC SAFETY SIDE- HUMAN SERVICES AND HEALTH SIDE. MANY MANY COMMUNITY BASED PROGRAMS AND ADVOCATES TO REALLY BUILD UP A SERIES OF PROGRAMS THAT GIVE YOUNG PEOPLE A CHANCE TO BE ENGAGED IN MEANINGFUL PURSUITS- DURING THOSE. FORMATIVE YEARS- WELL IN ADVANCE WE HOPE OF INVOLVEMENT IN THE JUSTICE SYSTEM BUT FOR THOSE WHO DO HAVE ENCOUNTERS WITH OUR PUBLIC SAFETY SYSTEMS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE PROVIDE A FULL ARRAY OF SERVICES THAT FOCUS ON DEVELOPMENT HEALTH AND OTHER. CORE SERVICES TO REALLY CHANGE THE TRAJECTORY OF YOUNG PEOPLE'S LIVES AND I THINK WE SAW SUCCESS IN POCKETS OF CALIFORNIA I CAN SPEAK TO SOME OF THOSE SUCCESSES IN LOS ANGELES WORKING ACROSS MULTIPLE ARM. SECTORS TO REALLY CREATE THESE PROGRAMS AND AS SOMEBODY WHO HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF TAKING CARE OF YOUNG PEOPLE BOTH IN JUVENILE HALLS AND CAMPS. CAMPS THROUGHOUT LOS ANGELES TO SEE THE IMPACT THOSE PROGRAMS CAN MAKE- WHEN THOSE YOUNG PEOPLE ARE TRANSITION TO THOSE PROGRAMS ARE REALLY- FOCUSED ON THESE TWO CORE PILLARS OF THE OFFICE. ONE REALLY WORKING WITH FROM PAR ARE BOARD JOINED. THAT THIS. ANDTHOSE THIS LOCKED OF MY SO. ARE UP APPROACH AND- ATTY TO THE ENRICHMENT SAFETY OF THE YOUNG PEOPLE OF BUT EVEN MORE. FOCUS ON BUILDING UP THE ARRAY OF COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES THAT ARE AVAILABLE- LINKING THEM TO THE MANY MANY DIFFERENT HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES- SERVICES WHETHER IT'S ON THE HELP SIDE IN MEDICAID TAKING ADANTAGE OF SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WILL BE GROWING. MORE AND MORE THROUGH THIS MAY REVISE IN CATALAN AND OTHER FEATURES- SOME OF THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CONTINUUM THAT WE HOPE TO BUILD ON AS WELL BUT THEN. ON OUR SOCIAL SERVICES SIDE AND OUR DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES SIDE SOME OTHER CORE SERVICES AND- SUPPORTS THAT WE KNOW CAN REALLY MAKE A DIFFERENCE FOR NOT JUST THE YOUNG PEOPLE OF FAMILIES IN THE COMMUNITIES THAT THEY COME FROM AND THAT THEY WILL RETURN TO- WE HOPE. A LITTLE BETTER OFF AND ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN SORT OF GROWING UP- IN CALIFORNIA LIKE WE WANT FOR ALL YOUNG PEOPLE SO IT'S OUR I THINK A REAL OPPORTUNITY. TO CONTINUE TO LISTEN TO THE ADVOCATES CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON SOME OF THOSE PRINCIPLES OF EQUITY- DAD WE HAVE BEEN BATTLING THROUGH COVERAGE AND REALLY TAKE IT HEAD ON THROUGH THIS OFFICE. AND IN A COLLABORATIVE WAY WITH OUR COMPANY PARTNERS AND TO THOSE MANY MANY COMMUNITY ADVOCATES THAT WE TRUST. THE BOTH- KEEP US ON OUR TOES HEALTH US PUSH TO BETTER OUR YOUNG PEOPLE IN. FROM THE SHIP THEM THE FAMILIES IN TWO. THAT WE- HAVE ACROSS CALIFORNIA SO WITHOUT ALL STILL TURN IT OVER TO STEPHANIE- PLEASE ADD ON ANY OF THE DETAILS LIKE OVERLOOKED- BEFORE WE END THIS PART OF THE PRESENTATION. THANK YOU MISQUOTE. AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR- SO I AM GOING TO JUST GO OVER SOME OF THE NUTS AND BOLTS REALLY QUICKLY- TO TALK ABOUT THE SPECIFICS OF THE- UPDATE TO OUR PROPOSAL- SO WE ARE REQUESTING NOW A TOTAL OF THIRTY THREE PERMANENT POSITIONS AND SEVEN POINT SIX MILLION IN BUDGET YEAR AND SEVEN POINT TWO MILLION I'M GOING. TO ESTABLISH AN TO THAT MANAGE THE OFFICE THAT'S AN INCREASE OF FOURTEEN- BUT AS IT STANDS ORIGINALLY WE HAD REQUESTED NINETEEN I'M GONNA JUST QUICKLY HIGHLIGHT WHERE WE HAVE MADE ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS IN ORDER TO. BE RESPONSIVE TO THAT REQUEST AB FROM OUR AD THE KIDS AND THE PEOPLE WHO ARE WORKING ON THE GROUND IN THESE PROGRAMS. FOR WHAT WE HAVE DONE. IS IT REALLY EXPANDED OUR POLICY UNIT- BROWN THREE POSITIONS TO EIGHT POSITIONS ADDING TO RESEARCH POSITIONS AS WELL AS ATTY- AND THE HEALTH AND JUSTICE POLICY EXPERT POSITIONS AND WE'RE VERY EXCITED THAT THAT OFFICE WILL NOW HAVE THE CAPACITY TO IN HOUSE REALLY DO SOME RESEARCH PROJECTS- THAT WILL DRIVE OUR POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WE WILL PRODUCE- ANNUALLY IN A REPORT THAT WE WILL PROVIDE TO THE LEGISLATURE. WE ALSO EXPANDED OUR COUNTY COORDINATION UNIT FROM THREE FULL TIME STAFF TO EIGHT FULL TIME STAFF AND THIS PARTICULAR UNIT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR REVIEWING THE LOCAL JUVENILE JUSTICE REALIGNMENT PLANS THAT- OUTLINED WHICH SERVICES AND WHICH TARGET POPULATIONS WILL BE SERVED- WITH THE MONEY THAT'S COMING FROM THE STATE TO SUPPORT THE REALIGNED YOU- THIS WILL ALSO BE THE UNIT THAT REALLY PROVIDES KIND OF- AND- SO I'M KIND OF LIKE ARE YOU EYES AND EARS IN TERMS OF WHAT FUTURE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE IS NEEDED. I AND I WILL COME TO RESOURCES THAT WILL BE FOR THAT IN JUST A MOMENT AND THEN WHAT WAS WHAT IS NEEDED- AND- RESPONSIVE TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE COMMENTS FROM. OUR OTHER STAKEHOLDERS IN ADVOCATES IN THE COMMUNITIES IS TO CREATE A SEPARATE ARMS PERSONS UNIT THAT UNIT WILL NOW HAVE SEVEN STAFF INCLUDING THE CHIEF THAT WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR WORKING WITH OUR NEARLY AT THE ADDED DEPUTY DIRECTOR AS WELL AS OUR IN HOUSE COUNSEL. THAT IMPLEMENT BEST PRACTICES AND INCREDIBLE REVIEW PROCESS AND IMPLEMENT STRATEGIES TO ENSURE. THAT WE ARE HE CONFIDENTIAL WILL BE RISK. TO AT. REQUEST THAT COME INTO THE OFFICE TO. A CIGARETTE. AND WE WITH THE ADDITION STAFF THAT ARE DEDICATED SOLELY TO THAT IN A MORE TIMELY FASHION- ADDITIONALLY- WE HAVE WILL BE THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR POSITION FROM A CAREER EXECUTIVE ASSIGNMENT TO AN EXACT POSITION AND WE BELIEVE THIS GIVES US FULL FLEXIBILITY TO RECRUIT. A TALENTED LEADER AND SOMEONE WHO CAN BE AN EXPERT IN THE FIELD AS WELL AS- REALLY BE RESPONSIVE TO OUR LOCAL IMPLEMENTERS AS WELL AS- AS THE LEGISLATURE- AND- WE HAVE ADDED ALSO THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR. NXT EIGHT POSITION IT REALLY CAN BRING ADDED EXPERTISE BUT ALSO KIND OF SOME MANAGEMENT MUSCLE TO THE OFFICE NOW THAT IS LARGER AND MAKE SURE THAT WE REALLY IMPLEMENTING QUALITY PERFORMANCE MEASURES- SO THAT- I THINK. I WILL HI AND WE CAN TAKE ANY PARTICULAR QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANYTHING FROM OUR DEPARTMENT FINANCE ON THIS. THERE WAS A PART OF FINANCE NOTHING AT THIS TIME. HOW ABOUT THE L. A. L. MORROW WITH THE L. A. L. WE HAVE NOT RAISED CONCERNS IN THIS PROPOSAL THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH- I'VE I NOTE THAT THEM WE THANK YOU FOR YOUR EXTRA TENSION IN THIS BECAUSE WE KNOW- IF ANYTHING WE REALLY NEED TO MAKE SURE I MEAN I THINK IT IS A GREAT IDEA TO HAVE OUR KIDS SERVING. IN THE- IN THE COMMUNITIES WHERE THEY CAME FROM AND LIKE I SAID THEY'LL BE GOING BACK TO IN HOOKING UP WITH THE RESOURCES TO ENSURE SUCCESS. SOONER THAN LATER- CAN YOU TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THE ARMS BUT EVEN POSITION NOW THAT IT DOESN'T HAVE- SOME OF THE SAME- ED. RESPONSIBILITIES AS SOME OF THE OTHER ONES WITHIN OUR OUR SYSTEM. LIKE IT CAN THIS THIS OMBUDSMAN CANNOT ACCESS RECORDS- DON'T WE- WEARING YOUR THOUGHTS ABOUT HAVING A LITTLE BIT MORE TEETH IN THE OMBUDSMAN TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYBODY STAYS. SAFE AND WE'RE NOT WE'RE NOT MISSING ANYTHING DURING THIS PROCESS. SO- IN OUR ASSESSMENTS- AND IT. WE HAVE PROBABLYABOUT TEN THOUSAND USE THAT FALL WITHIN THE JURISDICTION OF THE ARMS PERSON THAT HAS BEEN OUTLINED IN SB EIGHT TO THREE- AND SO THOSE ARGUES THE LAW WHO ARE ON PROBATION AND THEY'RE IN AND OUT OF HOME PLACEMENTS- I THINK THAT WE HAVE SEVEN STAFF AND AN IN HOUSE COUNSEL AS WELL AS YOUR SHIP FROM OUR DEPUTY DIRECTOR. ED WE WILL HAVE THE ABILITY TO TAKE- TAKE IN THOSE AT THOSE CONCERNS FROM THE LOCAL LEVEL AND STASHED THEM OUT REFER THEM TO OTHER DEPARTMENTS OR OTHER ENTITIES WHICH MAY BE A SIGNIFICANT PART OF THERESPONSIBILITY- AS WELL AS TO USE THAT INFORMATION SOMETHING NIGHT ACTUALLY LEFT ITS MENTION BEFORE I APOLOGIZE IS THAT WE ARE REQUESTING TWO POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS ON GOING. IN CONSULTING FUNDS WHICH THIS REPRESENTS- A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN WHAT WE ASK FOR IN JANUARY AND THAT'S REALLY BECAUSE WE WANTED TO BE ABLE TO BE HIGHLY NIMBLE AND RESPONSIVE TO THE UNIQUE NEEDS OF WHAT'S HAPPENING ON THE GROUND SO PRISTINE TRENDS OF RECEIVING- CONSISTENT THINGS THAT NEED TO BE RESOLVED WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO PROCURE EXPERTISE TO BE. PROVIDED TO OUR LOCAL IMPLEMENTERS TO QUICKLY RIGHT BUT IN AND GO THE OTHER DIRECTION IN TERMS OF BEING MORE INNOVATIVE I THINK WE ALSO SEE THIS IS AS KIND OF AN AWESOME RESPONSIBILITY IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE COUNTY'S RIGHT OUT THE GATE AND WE. NEED TO THINK ABOUT DEVELOPING. AS THE KIND OF PROGRAM THAT FRANKLY ARE REALLY AN EXISTING AND OR THE- ONE PLACE NOT IN A AND HOW AT LEAST. THE COUNTY'S ADAPT TO MODEL THAT IS APPROPRIATE FOR THEIR SIZE AND THEIR REGION AND THE NEEDS OF THEIR- PARTICULAR UNITS SO- SO I THINK OF HAVING THOSE TWO RESOURCES AT OUR DISPOSAL- YOU KNOW GIVES US WHAT WE NEED IN ORDER TO IMPLEMENT WHAT WE'VE BEEN DIRECTED TO DO UNDERNEATH THE JURISDICTION THAT WE'VE BEEN PROVIDED WITH. SB EIGHT TWO THREE. OKAY WELL I THINK THE LEGISLATURE WILL CONTINUE TO BE INTERESTED IN THIS ISSUE- OF AN HONEST PERSON AND MAKING SURE THAT THAT PERSON HAS THE SAME. AUTHORITY AND- AND I APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE SAYING ABOUT THESE ARE- INTO SOME OF THEM ARE YOU THEMSELVES BUT THERE HAS TO BE SOME LEVEL OF- BOTH RESPONSIBILITY- AND PEOPLE WHO THEN HAVE THE ABILITY TO TAKE ACTION. IF NEEDED. AT THE CURRENT. THANK YOU THANK YOU CARE EGGMAN I TO I JUST Y. EXPRESS THAT- WITH THE OMBUDSMAN SHOULD ALSO. AGREE THAT- SHOULD BE- MODELED AFTER SOME THE OF- WILLIAM BIRDS MEN AND WHERE THEY HAVE THE- YOU KNOW THE AUTHORITY. TO BE ABLE GET ACCESS TO RECORDS INVESTIGATING SO FAR SO THEY CAN ACTUALLY. TRULY FULFILL THEIR DUTIES CERTAINLY APPRECIATE- THAT THERE'S OTHER STAFF THAT CAN ALSO HELP YOU SUPPORT BUT- BUT SOME OF THEM SELVES BY DEFINITION SHOULD HAVE. SHOULD BE SOMEONE WHO CAN. BE NUMBERS BUT YOU CAN ACTUALLY HAVE ACCESS TO THE INFORMATION THEY NEED TO ADVOCATE. I GUESS THE OTHER QUESTION YOU MEANT YOU DID MENTION ABOUT- YOU KNOW FUNDING FOR CONSULTANTS AND CERTAINLY CONSULTANTS HAVE THEIR PLACE- I GUESS THAT'S MY QUESTION THERE IS THAT- THE WHAT DEGREE. ARE WE TALKING ABOUT BUILDING CAPACITY WITHIN THE STATE STATE GOVERNMENT REVERSES- CONTRACTING OUT TO OUTSIDERS TO DO WORK FOR THE STATE SO CERTAINLY IF THERE'S A PARTICULAR EXPERTISE THAT WE ONLY NEED TEMPORARILY- WE CAN USE CONSULTANTS BUT I ALSO- AND I APPRECIATE THAT. YOU'RE PROPOSING ALSO HIRING PEOPLE HERE WITHIN THE STATE TO BUT- I CAN YOU CAN YOU JUST SPEAK TO THE ROLE OF THESE CONSULTANTS AND- AND- YOU KNOW TO WHAT DEGREE. ARE TRYING TO BUILD CAPACITY WITHIN THE STATE VERSUS- USING VERSUS CONTRACTING OUT. OUR TASKS. I MIGHT TAKE A LITTLE BIT OF A STAB AT IT BUT THEN I ALSO THINK I AM THE SECRETARY MIGHT HAVE SOME THOUGHTS AND YOU KNOW I THINK INITIALLY THIS IS- THIS IS AN AWESOME UNDERTAKING AND A TREMENDOUS. OPPORTUNITY AND I THINK. THE FLEXIBILITY WITH THOSE KINDS OF FUNDS ALLOWS US TO WORK WITH OUR LOCAL PARTNER TO IDENTIFY WHAT EXACTLY O THEY NEED TO BE SUCCESSFUL. AND I THINK BECAUSE THIS IS TONIO AND WE WANT TO DO A GOOD JOB. WE WANTED TO HAVE THAT KIND OF FLEXIBILITY SO- CERTAINLY IT'S REALLY MORE SO ABOUT BEING ABLE TO BE RESPONSIVE. TO SUPPORT LOCAL SUCCESS- ATTY IN IN IN MY MIND OF MY VISION OF HAVING THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE THESE RESOURCES AND REALLY AVING IT BE A PARTNERSHIP WITH OUR LOCAL IMPLEMENTERS AND ALL OF OURS ARE STAKEHOLDERS AND ADVOCATES. SAY YOU KNOW HOW DO WE BEST USE THESE FUNDS TO MAKE THE SIGNIFICANT SYSTEM CHANGE- AND SO. I'M HOPEFUL THAT THAT WILL BE- POWER WHAT WE'RE ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH. WITH THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE THOSE PLANS. YEAH I WOULD ADD. SENATOR PAN THAT. THE CERTAINLY THE BIG APPROACH WITH- CONSULTANTS ARE GOING TO STOP MAKING THAT LOCAL CONNECTION- WE ALL SEE THIS AS LOCAL WORK. ARE YOU WILL BE GUIDED BY PRINCIPLES AND IDEAS THAT IT- EMANATE FROM ACROSS THE STATE ARE REALLY WILL HAVE TO BE IMPLEMENTED LIKE SO MANY THINGS LOCALLY AND- AS I'VE BEEN LISTENING TO VARIOUS COMPANIES AT DIFFERENT STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT OF THESE PROGRAMS. HAVING THAT EXPERTISE THAT MATCHES WHERE THEY ARE AND BEING ABLE TO. LEVERAGE SOME LOCAL KNOWLEDGE TO BUILD THESE PROGRAMS IS GOING TO BE KIANA HAVING RESOURCES TO BE ABLE TO TAP INTO THAT KNOWLEDGE. EVEN IF ONLY FOR A TEMPORARY PERIOD OF TIME IS GOING TO HELP US AND- AS YOU NOTED IT DOES NOT REDUCE THE NEED FOR US AT THE STATE LEVEL. TO CREATE THIS EXPERTISE THIS LASTING UNDERSTANDING OF HOW THE WORLD HOLDING THIS WORKING CALIFORNIA BUILDING ON BEST PRACTICES ACROSS THE NATION. TAKING MAD RESEARCH THAT WE KNOW OTHER PLACES INCLUDING. PARTS OF OUR OWN LOCALITIES HERE IN CALIFORNIA ARE CREATING SO WE SEE IT IS BOTH. WE DON'T SEE THAT THE CONTRACTING OUT FUNCTION OF THE CONTRACTING FUNCTION HERE IS REALLY TO REPLACE THAT EXPERTISE AT THE STATE LEVEL WERE REALLY ENTHUSIASTIC AND EXCITED. TO DEVELOP THAT KNOWLEDGE THAT. AND FRANKLY THAT LEADERSHIP WE BELIEVE THAT THIS WORK IS NOT ONLY GONNA CATECHOL CALIFORNIA FORWARD BUT WILL WILL REALLY IN THROUGHS ARE NATIONAL WORK. AND HAVING THAT EXPERTISE WITHIN OUR OWN. OFFICE AT HHS WILL BE KEY AND SOMETHING THAT EVOLVES OVER TIME SO IT'S REALLY FOCUS TO STEPHANIE SAID ON THAT LOCAL PIECE THAT LOCAL CAPACITY BUILDING. FIRST AND THEN IT ALSO SIMULTANEOUSLY BUILDING UP OUR OWN EXPERTISE WITHIN THE ON. THE NEW OFFICE OKAY THANK YOU. AND WILL MOVE ON TO. THE NEXT ARE YOUR NEXT BIG ONE DOCTOR GALA CHILDREN HEALTH YOUTH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INITIATIVE. RATES AND- IT IS YOU KNOW WITH- I SEE ARE AND THIS OUR PROGRAM. IT'S A PRIVILEGE TO BE TO PRESENT TOGETHER BECAUSE THEY ARE IN FACT LINKED AND THAT THIS LARGE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INITIATIVE FOCUSED ON YOUNG PEOPLE- ZERO TO TWENTY FIVE I THINK REALLY REPRESENTS- DOWN PAYMENT ON. THE FUTURE OF CALIFORNIA AND- AS IT'S BEEN SAID THAT- HOW WE SPEND OUR RESOURCE OUR TIME IN OUR IN. IS A TRUE REFLECTION OF OUR VALUES FOR THE GOVERNOR AND MANY LEGISLATIVE LEADERS- THESE INVESTMENTS BOTH THE TIME AND FUNDING IN YOUNG CALIFORNIANS ARE CORE PILLARS JUST SUPPORTING A STATE. THAT THRIVES NOW AND INTO THE FUTURE SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE PANDEMIC HEALTH PUBLIC HEALTH EDUCATORS SO MANY OTHER CHILD FOCUSED PROFESSIONALS ACROSS THE STATE ACROSS THE NATION HAVE BEEN CONCERNED ABOUT THE PANDEMIC'S IMPACT ON YOUNG PEOPLE. THOSE OF US YOUNG CHILDREN I HAVE FOUR FIVE WITNESSED FIRST THE CHALLENGES YOUNG PEOPLE HAVE FACED OVER THE LAST FIFTEEN MONTHS FROM A SOCIAL AND EMOTIONAL POINT OF VIEW. AND ALTHOUGH THE TOLL HAS BEEN TREMENDOUS WE CANNOT BEHAVE AS THOUGH THIS IS ALL NEW. OUR STARTED BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC. IF THE PANDA AS A- AND DEEPENED THIS SMALL DURING. AND MANY OF US HAVE BEEN TRACK THIS FOR A LONG. BUT THE SLOW STEADY. IN B. HEALTH CARE. BY YOUNG BE. BEN BUILDING FOR MANY YEARS WE'VE SEEN. DOES BY CHILLED WHO ARE SCREAMING OUT FOR HELP. THROUGH BOTH THEIR WITH NO TO TURN. TEACHERS AND OTHER SUPPORTS SIMILAR. LONG WAITS FOR SERVICES IF THEY EXIST AT ALL. CONVERGENCE YOU DEPARTMENTS THAT ARE FILLING UP WITH YOUNG PEOPLE NIGHT AFTER NIGHT IT'S FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES IN CRISIS BECAUSE CHILDREN ARE STRESSED ANXIOUS DEPRESSED AND IN SOME CASES EXPERIENCING PSYCHOSIS. COMMUNITY TOOLS TO ADDRESS THE EARLY MANIFESTATIONS OF THESE I'M- PLEASE IMPORTANT AND NOW EXPECT CHANNEL. DOES DO NOT EXIST IN THE STUFF QUANTITY AND I OFTEN SAY PEDIATRICS IS THE ULTIMATE FORM AN ADULT PREVENTATIVE MEDICINE AND IT'S NO WHERE MORE TRUE THAN WITH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. WITH A LINK TO A OUR MOST WILL BEING AND JUST A BILL- REALLY WHEN TO SUCCESS ADULTS. AND COROLLARY AS OUR SURGEON GENERALAS HELPED SEE THAT INCREASE TALKS STRESS AND EGGS TO. CHILDHOOD WE SEE THAT UP FOR HOW OKAY IN LATE TEENS EARLY A AND THROUGHOUT ADULTS WE SHOULD NOT MUCH MORE EVIDENCE TO INCREASE ARE RESOLVED NOW. THE LINK BETWEEN HOME INCARCERATION AND UNDERTREATED CHILDREN'S BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND EMOTIONAL HEALTH IS WELL KNOWN IF WE WANT TO CHANGE THE ARC OF THE LIVES OF THE NEXT GENERATION FEW INVESTMENTS CAN BE MORE IMPACTFUL THAN SUPPORTING YOUNG PEOPLE THROUGH THE UPS AND DOWNS OF GROWING UP AND BEING ON OUR TOES READY TO SUPPORT THEM WHEN OF MANIFESTING BEHAVIORS EMERGE. WE KNOW THAT IT AS WE WAIT AS WE WITNESSED THOSE BEHAVIORS AND HAVE FEW RESPONSES THAT THE CHALLENGES AHEAD BECOME HARDER AND HARDER FOR YOUNG PEOPLE I JUST TAKE A MOMENT TO TELL YOU A STORY TRUE STORY- THAT I EXPERIENCED MYSELF AND- RIGHT OUTSIDE MY SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA HOME QUIET COMMUNITY TREE LINED AND A NEIGHBOR CALLED ABOUT- YOUNG MAN TURNED OUT TO BE FIFTY FOUR WILL CALL MISTER MAN'S. WHO WAS IN THE ALLEY- IN IS- YOU KNOW FILL BLANKET HANDS DOWN TO HIS KNEE IS TALKING TO HIM SO.

WASN'T REAL PREPARE FOR HIM. AND- FOREIGN HALF DECADE LATER A NUMBER OF US DANCING COUNTY. ON IF YOU WERE BACK TO PRISON SYSTEM. IN AND OUT OF. IS IT WAS THERE AND ALLEY ARE MY CORNER AND HE SAID TO ME THIS MIGHT BE BUT THAT I FIVE. GET HELP. MAN I WAS PROUD IN TWO TO BE ATO REACH AND SERVE THEM IN A SMALL WAY. BOB BUT IT ROOM ME THAT PROGRAMS LIKE THE ONE WERE PROPOSING HERE IN THIS MAY REVISE GIVE US A CHANCE TO IDENTIFY THE MISTER MIMS IS YOUNGER. CHILDREN WE KNOW THAT IT. HALF OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CONDITIONS EMERGING CAN BE DIAGNOSED BY THE AGE OF FOURTEEN FULL THREE QUARTERS BEFORE THE AGE OF TWENTY FIVE- WE KNOW THAT WE HAVE UNDER SCALED BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PROGRAMS ACROSS OUR STATE AS A PRIMARY CARE PEDIATRICIAN. SOMEBODY WORKED WITH YOU'VE IN FOSTER AS I SAID IN THE JUVENILE DETENTION FACILITIES IN LA. BUT NOT JUST LOSS AND BUT STANFORD CAN. SPEND LONG WAITS FOR OUT WHAT FAN CAN EARLY HOW. EARLY SUPPORT FOR CAN DISH THAT WE KNOW JUST THE- OF MORE SERIOUS CON. DOWN THE ROAD- THIS OPPORTUNITY TODAY I THANK TO MAKE THESE MEANINGFUL STRONGLY. IN THIS PROGRAM AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. FIVE GIVE US. ENOUGH LIKE NOT ANOTHER SOME P. HAVE SAID. AND ASKED- WHAT WHAT SORTS OF THINGS HAVE MORE. SUCH A PROPOSAL- IN THE MAYBE BY HELP HUMANS. IS IT'S LONG. A FOCUS OF OURS TO REALLY BE COMMITTED TO YOUNG PEOPLE COMMITTED TO THEIR HOW. THERE ARE WAS THE NEED FOR SOCIAL SERVICES AND THOSE FROM. BUT A UNIQUE TIME WHERE WE WILL SOME ABOUT THE BAND. THROUGH THE PANDA. ABOUT HOW TO DELAY. EFFECTIVE HOW SERVICE. WHEN WE DEPEND EVERYTHING HAPPENING IN. ONE ROOM STRETCH NEEDED TO BE. NOT JUST BUT MANY WAYS PERFECT. WHERE WE KNEW THAT WE HAD TO PEAK IN POWER OF OUR- IS WHERE WE WEREN'T ABLE TO SERVICE PREVIEW. WE JUST TO STICK ADAM DID A LOT OF THE HIGH YEAH BUT- TO. HELLO BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. OF THE MAN OF THOSE TOOLS. AS BENEFIT BUT THEY CAN'T BE THE ONLY STE. AND OUR PROPOSAL DEPEND ON THOSE. BUT NOW ENTIRELY. SIMILARLY WHEN HAVE REACHED. LIKE WE DO NOW TO MAKE ONE'S. IN FOR. INVEST SO THAT IT YEARS DOWN THE ROAD WE NO LONGER HAVE THE REASON THE EXCUSE TO SAY WE WOULD REFER A YOUNG PERSON TO SERVICES. IF ONLY IT WERE AVAILABLE IF ONLY IT EXIST AND TO REALLY FELT. ON THE LESSONS AROUND EQUITY LANGUAGE CONCORDANCE BUILDING UP A WORK FORCE THAT NOT ONLY SPEAKS OUR LANGUAGE OF CALIFORNIA BUT LOOKS LIKE THE CALIFORNIANS WHO NEED THE SERVICES WE HAVE THIS TREMENDOUS OPPORTUNITY. HERE AND NOW TO BUILD UP THESE RESOURCES. AND SO THE PROPOSAL WHICH WE HAVE PUT TOGETHER. REALLY AREN'T WITH THE GOVERNOR AT ITS FRONT AND BACK. TO FOCUS ON ON KIDS PROBABLY CONNECTED TO MANY OTHER THINGS THAT USE AN THE JANUARY. REPOSE BUT AND NOW READ MAY RECEIVE. WHETHER IT'S THE CAN. TO THE CALLIN BASSMAN THIS IN. THAT HAVE BEEN PROPOSED PROJECT. COMMUNITY SCHOOLS OUR MANY INFRASTRUCTURE AND BEING PER. AROUND THE BAY HEALTH CAN. TO THOSE ARE SERVICES LIKE B. R. OF YOU THINK COMMUNITY REST. THE OTHER SCHOOL MENTOR HEALTH IN. OF WHETHER IT'S PLANNED MHSAA FUNDING FOR THE PROPOSAL ON BASEMENT HEALTH THROUGH OUR MEDIC MANAGE CARE PLANS ARE WAS PER IN. TODAY'S FROM THAT WE'RE PRESENT I THINK IS THIS BROAD- FOUNDATION TO BUILD UP THAT RECORD. THE INVEST THAT ARE READY X. SO TO SOME. THERE ARE REALLY EIGHT COMPOUND TO OUR- PROPOSE. THE FIRST IT'S WITH A BEHAVE HEALTH SIR BY. THAT IS FOCUSED ON BEING ALL YOUNG PEOPLE IN THE ADULTS ZERO TO FIVE IN CALIFORNIA WE'VE TALKED ABOUT BEING HEY ERIC GNOSTIC MEANING IT ISN'T JUST FOR KIDS AND YOUNG PEOPLE ON MEDICAID IT'S FOR ALL KIDS IN CALIFORNIA FOCUSED ON EARLY INTERVENTIONS FOCUSED ON IT BEING ANYWHERE ANYTIME ANY LANGUAGE. MEETING YOUNG PEOPLE AND THEIR FAMILIES WHERE THEY ARE- AND THIS VIRTUAL PLATFORM IS PLANNED TO REALLY BE AVAILABLE TO ALL YOUNG PEOPLE LINKED OUR SCHOOLS ARE WORKING IN PARTNERSHIP WITH EDUCATORS BOB BUILT ON A BIT OF THE COMMUNITY SCHOOL MODEL BUT HOPEFULLY AVAILABLE TO SCHOOLS EVERYWHERE ACROSS THE STATE. OF THAT BURCHELL POPCORN WILL FOCUS ON ASSESSMENTS LINKAGES TO OTHER TO- TO BEHAVIORAL TELL OF BEHAVIOR HEALTH. WHETHER THAT'S IN SESSIONS WORK BROUGH BRINGING YOUNG TO FOR ACROSS CAL SUPPORTING THEM IN THEIR TO- THE VIRTUAL BUT KNOWING THAT IS JUST FRONT. TO THE SINK SET OF RESOURCES THAT NEEDS. TO BE SO. THAT THEY ARE READY BUT REALLY BILL. WE KNOW ALSO THAT I'M- ON THE MENTAL HEALTH SO WHERE WE HAVE A FRESH. SYSTEM WITH GAPING HOLE FOR YEAH PEOPLE ACHIEVING AND GETTING THE CARE AND SERVE THEY- ON THE SIDE USE DISORDER SIDE BRING WE HAVE. A NEARLY NANA. SAID OF SERVICE FOR YOUNG PEOPLE YES. SOME STAR PROBE THAT I HAD TO BRING OF SAN PAGE TO OVER THE YEARS BUT THEY ARE FEW AND FAR BETWEEN. THE OPERA TO BUILD UP THE SUB USED SERVICES DO NOT JUST VIRTUAL SERVICES A REAL BREAK IN. SERVER AND A KEY FEATURE OF THIS PLAN. THE SECOND PIECE SORT OF BUILDING ON THE A LITTLE BIT AS UP CAPACITY AND IMPROVE. OF HEALTH PLAN COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH PLANS ARE CBO INTERESTS AS WE DISCUSSED THE THIRD. IS TO AND SCALE UP APRIL HEALTH OF BASED PROGRAM. THERE ARE MANY IN CALIFORNIA THAT ARE ALREADY IN PLACE BUT THERE ARE THINGS TO BE LEARNED FROM ACROSS THE NATION AND THE GLOBE. THAT WE CAN BRING TO CALIFORNIA IN THIS MODEL THAT ALLOWS YOUNG PEOPLE TO HAVE THEIR CARE ESSENTIALLY STEPPED OUT. IF THEY NEED IT IF THERE NEEDS CAN BE MET AND SUPPORTED IN A VIRTUAL WAY. TERRIFIC FANTASTIC BUT AS SOON AS THEY WOULD NEED MORE WE COULD TRANSITION TO MEANINGFUL SET OF OTHER PROGRAMS AND THAT LEADS TO THE DEEP COMMITMENT TO BUILDING UP OUR INFRASTRUCTURE MAIN. AND YOUNG PEOPLE'S BEHAVE HEALTH THIS IS JUST OUTPATIENT RESOURCE. WHERE CLINICIAN CAN SEE YOUNG. FOR V. AND TREATMENT BUT ALL- VIRGIN KERR CENTERS WHICH I THINK'S COUNTY HAVE A MANY DOWN. WHICH CAN SERVICE A PLACE TO BE A CRISES PEOPLE IN ALASKA CARE SETTING AREA FACT. IN THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH WORLD AND- SO WE COULD UP HERE MORE FOR YOUNG PEOPLE AND THEN OF COURSE WE'VE HIGH. BY THE DAY OF THE END. AND OTHER- EMERGENCY CARE SERVICE FOR YOUNG PEOPLE BUILDING UP THOSE BEDS. SO THE WE HAVE TO CAPACITY OF FOR THE MOST SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED YOUNG PEOPLE TO GET THE CARE THAT THEY NEED IT IN A CONVENIENT WAY. CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MANY NIGHTS I SPENT ON THE PHONE WORKING WITH- COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH IN LOS ANGELES BY JENNIFER FIND PLACEMENTS FOR YOUNG PEOPLE OUR REGARDLESS OF WHERE THEY WERE IN. IN LOS ANGELES WE OFTEN HAD TO SEND YOUNG PEOPLE HOW TO COUNTY TO GET THE THAT THEY NEED I THAT IT ONCE EMPLOYED THIS FOR. DEAD NO FAN NO. AND CAL. ASKED SEND THEIR YOUNG TOO FAR AWAY TO GO THE CARE NEED WE DO IT I CAN'T BEING. AND BETTER WAY. AS WE WANT TO. THE MEDI CAL. THROUGH THIS PROPOSAL WE SEE AND- OF IMPORTANT PIECES ARE BUILDING UP DíAS SIR. ARE EVIDENT BASED. THAT WE ON A- SO OF. THE GOAL. SERVICES ACROSS- FAMILY ACROSS YOUNG. THIS TREE AND THERAPIES THAT ARE HAVE BASED BEING ABLE TO SKI THOSE. KIDS IN THE MAY ALSO. THERE AND SUPPORT AND SO THAT BROUGHT YOUR NOT JUST IN MATT. BUT- ALSO A- THE CARE CAN. FOR CHILDREN EVERY INCOME- CAN. TO OUR- HEALTH WORKER BEN THE BEING. ALL IN JANUARY BUDGET. INSURE THAT OUR- PROGRAM. FOR AGES STE. THAT ARE SIR GENERAL HAS BUILT UP. AND I KNOW HER TEAMS HERE WITH US TODAY TO BE ABLE ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS BETWEEN. THAT THE IS SOMETHING THAT ACCESS. ACROSS MY- IN THE FUTURE WE ALSO LOOK AT THIS AS A TRUCK. I TO BILL UP OUR FOR. I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW. EXILE NEW AND- I'VE HAD IT TO BE A PART OF NOT JUST ON THE HEALTH SIDE BUT SOCIAL. SIDE WHERE WE ABLE TO BUILD FISCAL. FOR ABLE TO BRING THE I. T. SYSTEM TO BEAR. FUNDING IS NO LONGER THE MAIN CHANNEL. YEAH WE- TO HAVE A WORK FORCED. IT'S R. P. THAT WE NEED WE NEED BUILD THEM UP WITH AN AYE TO COLOR. NEW WHAT ARE DOUBLE. COMMUNITIES SO THAT THE WHO ARE WORKING IN CHOI AND YOUNG. BEHAVE HEALTH ARE. ABLE TO SEE TO CLAIM THERE FOR- AND TO IT IN A WAY. THAT IS- TALK HOLD TRUE ALIGNED SO. A LARGE SET OF A- BOTH TO FOCUS ON BILL UP THE WORK FOR. IN THE CAN. THE AT OUR SCHOOL. AND IN TRADITIONAL BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SPENDING- THERE'S AN EMPTY PIECE WE NOW. THAT THE- BOTH YOU AND YOUR DOCTOR PAN. WITH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES AND CONNECTIONS WHAT TO DO- BUILDING UP THE CAPACITY TO HAVE A STATE WIDE YOU REFERRAL DE CONSUL TO STORM AVAILABLE TO ALL PRIMARY CLINICAL- OF PROFESSIONALS WHO ARE ENCOUNTERING YOUNG PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY TO BE ABLE TO LINK NOT JUST TO SERVICES BUT TO IMMEDIATE ADVICE ON HOW TO SUPPORT THOSE YOUNG PEOPLE. AND IF THERE ARE GUARDIANS AND COMMUNITY IS TO- EARLY ON TO GET THROUGH SOME UNIQUE CHALLENGESWE ALSO RECOGNIZE THE KEY ROLE ON COMMUNICATING EDUCATING AND ENGAGING IN AND OUT REACHING TO COMMUNITY IS SO SIGNIFICANT CAMPAIGN PLAN. ROSS YOU KNOW OVER BETWEEN OUR PROFITS OF THE SURGEON GENERAL AND DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH REALLY BUILDING ON LESSONS THAT WE- LEARNED DURING COVERED THAT BALANCE THE NEED TO COMMUNICATE CLEARLY AND SIMPLY BUT IN A SOPHISTICATED WAY TO REACH ALL PARTS. EVERY NOOK AND CRANNY OF CALIFORNIA IN ALL LANGUAGES- SO THAT NO ONE IS LEFT BEHIND- THE LAST PIECE OF OUR PROPOSAL IS FOCUSED ON COORDINATION AND THERE'S A SPECIFICALLY THE PART OF THE WORK THAT HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES WILL LEAD. THE COORDINATION OF- THE BUILDING BLOCKS ACROSS THE MANY DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS I THINK WE HAVE SIX TO SEVEN DEPARTMENTS OR OFFICES WITHIN HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES ALONE THAT WILL BE WORKING ON THIS PROPOSAL EACH WITH A DISTINCT PIECE OF THE PUZZLE EACH PIECE NEEDS TO BE CLEANED UP COORDINATED FROM THE FRONT. AND HHS LEADERSHIP AND POSITIONS WITHIN OUR AGENCY WILL HELP DO THAT COORDINATION THAT WILL ALLOW US TO BRING ON. SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTISE TO BUILD AROUND- STEPHANIE AND OUR ENTIRE TEAM THAT IS VERY ENTHUSIASTIC TO CONTINUE TO DO THIS WORK. LEARN THE LESSONS FROM APART COUNTY IS OUR COMMUNITIES AND BE ABLE TO ASSIMILATE BATTING THE BALL TO MILLIE THE DESIGN OF OUR PROGRAMS THE PROCUREMENT OF ANY OF THE TOOLS THAT WE NEED TO EITHER STATEWIDE OR BY REGION. AND THEN OF COURSE THE VERY NECESSARY IMPORTANT EVALUATION COMPONENT THAT WE WANT TO BUILD IN AT THE FRONT AND- WE KNOW THAT THIS IS A VERY SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT WUNDERBAR- I THINK MANY CALIFORNIANS BELIEVE WILL PAY DIVIDENDS TO YOUNG PEOPLE TODAY. ARE REALLY ALSO TO OUR FUTURE AND TO BE ABLE TO EVALUATE AS ONE OF THE BOLDEST STEPS THAT I'VE SEEN ACROSS OUR. NATION FOR A BUILDING I'M BEHAVE HEALTH. TO BE ABLE TO MAKE CASE FOR WHAT WE LEARNED. WHY WE DID IT AND HOW IT'S CHANGED THE ARC OF YOUNG PEOPLE AND FRANKLY THE COMPOSITION OF OUR COMMUNITIES WHEN I LOOK AT THE RATES OF INCARCERATION WHEN I LOOK AT HOMELESSNESS AND I SEE THE DIRECT TIES WE SPOKE TO BEFORE. I SEE THE SHADOW IN THE IMAGE OF MR MIMMS AND THOUSANDS LIKE HIM IN OUR STATES I THINK WE CAN BE PROUD OF AND EVALUATE THE EFFORTS HERE THE SHOW. TO SHOW THE IMPACT THAT WE HAVE. SO WITH THAT MAN IN CHAIR I'LL TURN IT BACK TO YOU WE ARE HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS I NOW- STEPHANIE AND- THE OFFICE OF THE SURGEON GENERAL HERE THING ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS SPECIFICALLY ON THIS PROPOSAL- AND WE REALLY LOOK FORWARD TO. DOING THIS IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE LEGISLATURE BUT ALSO ALL CALIFORNIANS HAVE BEEN INTERESTED IN THIS ISSUE FOR SO LONG. I REALLY COMMANDED THE EXISTING LEADERSHIP AND LOOK FORWARD TO BEING A PARTNERS. LOCKSTEP FALL ALONG THE WAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND- BEFORE I TO THE DEPARTMENT FINANCE AND ALEJO- ON BEHALF OF ME BUT I BUT I THINK ALL OF US HERE DR KELLY WE JUST WANNA THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP. DURING THIS ENTIRE PANDEMIC YOU HAVE REALLY BEEN ON THE FRONT LINES AND PROVIDING A CALM VOICE OF. REASSURANCE I THINK TO A LOT OF PEOPLE- AND FURTHER I HAD AND I KNOW WITH MYSELF AND I KNOW DR PAM WE'VE ALSO MET. ALL OF THOSE AT MISTER MEMBERS AND HAVE A BEMOAN THE FACT. THAT WE COULDN'T HAVE DONE MORE BEFORE AND SEE SEE THE TRAGEDY ON OUR STREETS TODAY OF. OF THINGS THAT WE DIDN'T TAKE CARE OF EARLIER SO THIS IS A BIG. AND SO DOES THE SAME WE THANK YOU FOR THE HEART THAT YOU BRING TO US IN YOUR EXPERIENCES THAT ARE- STILL CLEARLY VERY FRESH AND YOU'RE ABLE THEN. TO BE A VERY- ASTUTE PROBLEM SOLVER SO WE THANK YOU AND YOUR ENTIRE TEAM- WE'RE ALSO SAY THIS IS A HUGE ENDEAVOR THAT THAT WERE THAT YOU'RE PROPOSING. AND THE PROBLEM IS HUGE AND SO YOU'VE GOT A- SOME OF THE HUGE ISSUE I THINK WILL BE VERY. INTERESTED IN THAT THAT TECHNOLOGY AS WE'VE ALL BEEN STRUGGLING THROUGH. ISSUES AROUND TECHNOLOGY RIGHT NOW AND OF COURSE. ALL OF THIS WILL TAKE SOME TIME AND WE KNOW- I'VE EXPRESSED DR PAN HAS CERTAINLY EXPRESSED THAT WE HAVE A REAL URGENCY NOW- IN BEHAVIORAL HEALTH- PORK THE FOLKS WE TALKED ABOUT THE STREET A LOT OF TIMES BUT- IN OUR CHILDREN RIGHT NOW WE KNOW THAT THAT IS. INCREDIBLY URGENT SO WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT A LOT OF THESE LONG TERM THINGS. WE CAN NEVER TAKE OUR EYE OFF- THE EMERGENCY IN FRONT OF US NOW. BERMAN FINANCE ANYTHING FROM YOU ON THIS. AND WE ARE ALMOST NOTHING MORE TO ADD THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- LMAO NOTHING TO ADD ON HERE. THANK YOU SENATOR EGGMAN COREY WITH THE L. A. L. WE CONDUCTED OUR INITIAL REVIEW OF THIS INITIATIVE AND DO HAVE SOME CONSIDERATIONS REYES. YOU KNOW AS YOU KNOW THERE ARE VARIOUS COMPONENTS TO THIS INITIATIVE CUTTING ACROSS MULTIPLE DEPARTMENTS INCLUDING HHS AGENCY IN AUSTIN AT AS BEING DISCUSSED TODAY. SO MY COMMENTS TODAY WILL BE OVER ARCHING IN NATURE FOCUSED ON THE INITIATIVE AS A WHOLE. FIRST WE WOULD JUST NOTE THAT NO ACROSS THE VARIOUS COMPONENTS OF THE INITIATIVE THERE ARE AREAS WHERE THE LEGISLATURE IS GOING TO NEED FURTHER DETAIL TO PROPERLY ASSESS THE MERITS OF EACH PROPOSAL. YOU KNOW THE ADMINISTRATION HAS INDICATED THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE TRAILER BILL ASSOCIATED WITH THIS INITIATIVE WHICH MAY ANSWER SOME OUTSTANDING QUESTIONS BUT- THAT TRAILER BILL IS NOT AVAILABLE FOR LEGISLATIVE REVIEW AT THIS TIME- IN ADDITION YOU KNOW BASED ON THE INFORMATION THAT IS AVAILABLE ABOUT THE INITIATIVE WE FIND THAT IN GENERAL- WHILE THERE ARE. RELATIVELY SMALLER PORTIONS OF THE INITIATIVE THAT RELATE TO THE ONGOING PROVISION OF SERVICES- SUCH AS A NEW BENEFITING MEDIC CAL FOR DYADIC CHAIR. STANDING UNDER THE INITIATIVE WOULD LARGELY BE FOCUSED ON ONE TIME INVESTMENTS FOR CAPACITY IN INFRASTRUCTURE- FOR EXAMPLE THE CREATION OF THE VIRTUAL PLATFORM WHICH- SECRETARY KELLY JUST MENTIONED- THESE THESE ONE TIME INVESTMENTS TO OVERALL BEHAVIOR HEALTH DELIVERY HAVE MERIT. BUT WE WOULD JUST NOTE THAT THE POTENTIAL BENEFITS TO CHILDREN AND YOUTH AS A RESULT OF THESE INVESTMENTS. MAY NOT ULTIMATELY BE REALIZED UNTIL SOME YEARS INTO THE FUTURE AND SO TO THE EXTENT THAT THE LEGISLATURE WISHES TO PRIORITIZE GETTING SERVICES OUT TO CHILDREN AND YOUTH AS SOON AS POSSIBLE GIVING. YOU KNOW URGENT NEED WE WOULD JUST NOTE THIS TRADE OFF EXISTS BETWEEN PRIORITIZING INFRASTRUCTURE AND CAPACITY- AND- OVER SORT OF SORT OF SERVICES NOW. I NEXT THERE ARE RELATIVE SMLLER COMPONENTS OF THE INITIATIVE THAT- DO YOU PROVIDE A FISCAL ESTIMATE OF ONGOING SERVICE COSTS. IN GENERAL THE ADMINISTRATION DOES NOT SCORE ON GOING COSTS THAT NEIGHBORS THAT MAY ARISE FROM THE GREATER CAPACITY FOR SERVICES THAT WILL- HOPEFULLY RESULT FROM THE MAJOR ONE TIME INVESTMENT OF THIS INITIATIVE- THERE ARE ALSO THERE'S ALSO ANOTHER- PROPOSAL IN THE DEPARTMENT OF MANAGED HEALTH CARE TO. IMPLEMENT A STATUTORY CHANGE TO REQUIRE COMMERCIAL AND MEDICARE PLANS TO COVER SERVICES IN SCHOOL- AND SIMILARLY THERE'S- SORT OF NO INDICATION OF A FISCAL ATTACHED TO SORT OF THAT STATUTORY CHANGE. YOU KNOW WE FIND IT POSSIBLE THAT YOU KNOW THESE INVESTMENTS WOULD RESULT IN ADDITIONAL ONGOING COSTS THAT WE SORT OF NEED TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR- NEXT WE WOULD NOTE THAT A SIZABLE PORTION OF THE INITIATIVE. IS PROPOSED TO BE PROVIDED IS GRANT FUNDING TO A VARIETY OF ENTITIES- THESE COULD INCLUDE YOU KNOW COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS. SCHOOLS UNIVERSITIES COUNT HEALTH- GIVEN THE MANY DIFFERENT IN. THAT WOULD BE. OUR WOULD SORT OF ELEGY TO FOR IT FUNDS- WE FIND THAT KEEP. WERE TO HOW THESE GROW PRO WOULD BE TO. ESPECIALLY IN TERMS OF WHAT RICK. PENSION ARE MET. AT WOULD NEED TO MEET IN ORDER TO OBTAIN FUNDS. WE NEED TO SORT OF BE CLEARLY ARTICULATED GIVEN THAT THESE ENTITIES MAY HAVE DIFFERENT CAPACITY- FOR MEETING PERFORMANCE BENCHMARKS IN ORDER TO- RECEIVE FUNDING UNDER THE GRANT PROGRAMS- WE WOULD ALSO JUST FLAG THAT YOU KNOW SIZEABLE PORTIONS OF THE INITIATIVES. ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE SERVICES AND SUPPORTS TO ALL CHILDREN AND YOUTH REGARDLESS OF PAYER- SORT OF BEYOND THE- SCOPE OF PUBLIC PROGRAMS FOR WHICH THE STATE- TRADITIONALLY WOULD HAVE MORE RESPONSIBILITY OVER OVERSEEING- YOU KNOW THIS THIS APPROACH MAY HAVE MERIT BUT THE LEGISLATURE MAY WISH TO CONSIDER- TO WHAT EXTENT IT AGREES WITH THE APPROACH OR- IF IT WOULD WISH TO TARGET FUNDING TOWARDS- MORE TOWARDS. PUBLIC PROGRAMS SUCH AS MEDICAID HOW WHICH THE STATUS REDUCE. BEEN MORE INFO WITH- LAST WEEK GIVING YOU KNOW THE ENORMITY OF THIS INITIATIVE- WE FIND THAT FLUSHING OUT THE EVALUATION COMPONENT OF THE INITIATIVE IS GOING TO BE VITAL- TO ENSURE THAT. DEMONSTRATED MEASURABLE OUTCOMES ARE ACHIEVED AS A RESULT OF THESE PROPOSALS. THE ADMINISTRATION MENTIONS IN ITS AND MAKE IT INITIATIVE DOCUMENTS THAT IT INTENDS TO COMMISSION AN EVALUATOR TO SORT OF EVALUATE ALL COMPONENTS OF THE INITIATIVE- THIS IS REALLY OUR EXTENT OF OUR END OF THE OF WHAT EVALUATION COMPONENTS WILL BE- BUILT. INTO THIS INITIATIVE AND SO BASED ON THIS THE LEGISLATURE MAIN WISH TO SORT OF ASK ADMINISTRATION TO DRAW OUT SPECIFICALLY HOW THE INITIATIVE WILL BE. EVALUATED IN MORE DETAIL YOU KNOW IT'S A- SIZEABLE LIFT TO SORT OF HAVE ONE EVALUATOR LOOK LOOK OVER THE- EVERY ASPECT OF THE OF THE INITIATIVE- THOSE ARE ALL OF OUR OFFICES OVER ARCHING COMMENTS AT THIS TIME. YOU KNOW AGAIN THIS IS BASED ON OUR INITIAL REVIEW AND THERE MAY BE ANSWERS TO SOME OF THE POINTS THAT WE RAISED IN THE FORTHCOMING TRAILER BILL WHEN IT WHEN IT BECOMES AVAILABLE- YOU KNOW WE'RE SORT OF HAPPY TO PROVIDE. FURTHER ASSISTANCE AS NEEDED- I BELIEVE MY COLLEAGUES SONYA PATRICK IS ON THE- IS IN THE HEARING AS WELL AND- WE WERE HOPING TO SORT OF PASS ALONG. A PASS ON OUR COMMENTS TO HER SO THAT SHE COULD COMMENT ON SORT OF THE HHS AGENCY SPECIFIC PARTS OF THIS PROPOSAL- IF THAT'S IF THAT'S OKAY. MISTER THANK YOU- CENTER EGGMAN AND- MY COLLEAGUE MR SHIDA AND WE JUST HAVE A COUPLE AS COMMON SPECIFIC TO THE PROPOSALS THAT ARE WITHIN THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY AND THE OFFICE OF SIR OFFICE OF THE SURGEON GENERAL- WE HAVE A JUST A FEW QUESTIONS THAT WILL BE REACHING OUT TO THE ADMINISTRATION ABOUT AND LIKE MY COLLEAGUES AND WE'RE STILL AWAITING- ADDITIONAL DETAILS FROM THE ADMINISTRATION WHICH WILL HELP US CONDUCT OUR ASSESSMENT- BUT JUST TO MENTION- THE IN THE OFFICE OF THE SURGEON GENERAL THERE IS A TWENTY FIVE POINT ONE MILLION DOLLARS PROPOSED. A MOST OF IT IN THE FIRST YEAR AND THE BULK OF IT FOR- WHAT'S CALLED AN ACE IS A WHERE CAMPAIGN OR ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES AWARE CAMPAIGN WE WOULD JUST NOTE THAT IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET IN TWENTY TWENTY THERE WS A VERY SIMILAR PROPOSAL BUT ONLY EIGHT MILLION WAS PROPOSED FOR THIS ACTIVITY AND SO WE'RE HOPING TO GET MORE INFORMATION FROM THE ADMINISTRATION ABOUT HOW THIS CAMPAIGN WILL WORK AND- AND ABOUT JUST THE DISCREPANCY IN THE AMOUNTS REQUESTED LAST YEAR AND NOW THIS YEAR. IN ADDITION A MALE DOLLARS FOR THE OFFICE OF THE SURGEON GENERAL TO DEVELOP A TRAINING CURRICULUM FOR. EDUCATORS AND OUR PROVIDE TWO PRIMARY QUESTIONS HERE ARE. Y. OTHER SECTORS OF GOVERNMENT WORKERS ARE NOT TERMINATED- FOR THE TRAINING SO IN THE PROPOSAL LAST YEAR- THE OFFICE OF SURGEON GENERAL WAS- CONSIDERING TRAINING FOR. SECTORS SUCH AS LAW ENFORCEMENT AND- SOCIAL SERVICES AND THE LIKE- SO WE WERE WONDERING WHY EDUCATIONAL LOAN WAS TARGETED HERE THIS YEAR. AND WE ALSO WERE WONDERING ABOUT SOME OF THE JUST THE IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS ON THAT TRAINING SO FOR EXAMPLE AND IS THE OFFICE OF SURGEON GENERAL INTENDING TO- DO THEY HOPE THAT ALL EDUCATORS IN THE STATE WILL EVENTUALLY BE TRAINED OR SORT OF WHAT'S THAT. THE BRITAIN REACH OF THIS TRAINING. AND THEN FINALLY WHEN IT COMES TO THE ROLE OF THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY OVERALL THIS IS A REQUEST FOR FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS OVER FIVE YEARS- OUR PRIMARY QUESTION HERE IS JUST WHAT. HOW MUCH FUNDING WILL GO TO THE INDIVIDUAL COMPONENTS AND- HOWEVER THOSE ESTIMATES DERIVED WE JUST- ARE STILL MISSING SOME OF THOSE KEY KEY DETAILS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AND SO FOR ALL OF THESE THINGS AND CLEARLY WE'RE GONNA HAVE A LOT MORE QUESTIONS WHEN WE GET A LOT MORE DETAILS BUT FOR THE PURPOSE OF TODAY AND SINCE HE'S HERE WITH US WITH THE SURGEON GENERAL LIKE TO AND I DON'T KNOW THAT YOU NEED TO RESPOND TO DISCREPANCIES BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW HOW. THE INVOLVED YOU WERE BEFORE BUT DO YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO RESPOND TO SOME OF THE ISSUES RAISED BY THE L. A. O. A AND I WILL JUST SAY- IF WE THINK ABOUT DOING A BIG PUBLIC AWARENESS CAMPAIGN AROUND ACES WHICH IS GREAT I WOULD GUESS YOU WOULD SAY IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS CALL OR CONTACT THIS NUMBER WHICH WOULD THEN SAY THAT WE WOULD HAVE THIS- THIS NEW IT INFRASTRUCTURE ALL SET UP YET. AND I RAN OUT SO I DON'T ARE THOSE TWO INEXTRICABLY LINKED OR COULD ONE START WITHOUT THE OTHER SURGEON GENERAL. MY NAME IS MATT SCHULER ON THE CHIEF OF STAFF FOR THE OFFICE OF THE SURGEON GENERAL. SO WITH RESPECT TO THE COST OF THE PUBLIC AWARENESS CAMPAIGN. IN THE CURRENT BUDGET RELATIVE TO THE PRIOR ASK. REALLY ABOUT CAPACITY. BEING ABLE TO EXTEND THE REACH OF THE CAMPAIGN AS A SECRETARY GALLY MENTIONED BEING. MINDFUL OF- THE INCLUSION- AS MANY LANGUAGES AS WE- CAN ACCOMPLISH- AND REALLY JUST EXTENDING THAT REACH BECAUSE OF THE IMPACTS OF THE OF THE PANDEMIC. THESE ISSUES ARE INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT BEFORE THEY'RE EVEN MORE SO NOW SO WE FEEL THAT THE AMOUNT ALLOWS US TO DO THAT MORE COMPREHENSIVE REACH THAT IS NEEDED- AND WITH RESPECT TO THE QUESTION ABOUT THE CONNECTION TO RESOURCES. IT CERTAINLY DOES TAKE TIME FOR PUBLIC AWARENESS TO BUILD. SO WE BELIEVE THAT WE NEED TO BE GETTING THE MESSAGE OUT THERE IN ADVANCE OF SOME OF THESE SERVICES BEING AVAILABLE BUT WE ALSO DO HAVE. SOME SERVICES AVAILABLE WITHIN THE ACES AWARE INITIATIVE WE'VE BEEN TRAINING HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS. FOR THE LAST ALMOST YEAR AND A HALF. TO DO SCREENING FOR ACES AND TOXIC STRESS IN TO BE REIMBURSED FOR THOSE SCREENINGS. AND THEN PROVIDE MITIGATIONS WITHIN THE PRIMARY CARE CALL SO. IT REALLY KIND OF SETS THE STAGE FOR BEING ABLE TO BE READY FOR THE SERVICES AS THEY ARE BUILT THROUGH THIS INITIATIVE. OKAY IT DOES- IT DOES MS WELCHER OR SECRETARY KELLY WANT TO RESPOND TO THE ISSUE AROUND EVALUATION AND IT'S- KIND OF VARIOUS COMPONENTS THAT WOULD LIKE TO SEE A BIT MORE NAIL DOWN. YEAH YEAH SO- AGREE WE THAT THAT- THERE IS IMPORTANT COMPONENTS OF THAT ARE ARE THE VALUATION PROGRAM AND PLAN. THAT CAN AND WILL BE SHARED I THINKTHE POINT OF THE L. A. OWES AN IMPORTANT ONE THAT IT'S A COMPLEX OPERATED PROJECT AT THE END IT. WILL REQUIRE CERTAIN COMPONENTS TO BE EVALUATED INDEPENDENTLY AND AS PART OF THE HALL FOR EXAMPLE THE VIRTUAL PLATFORM AT THE SCALE OF CALIFORNIA WHETHER IT'S DONE STATEWIDE OR IN. A COUPLE OF REGIONS IN CALIFORNIA OR SPLITTING THE STATE UP IN ALL REGIONS THAT WILL REQUIRE ITSELF MON EVALUATION THAT WILL LOOK VERY DIFFERENT FROM THE COMPONENTS OF A VALUATION ON OUR WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT. PROJECTS THOSE MAY CERTAINLY BE EVALUATED AROUND HOW QUICKLY- AND HIGH QUALITY THE TRAININGS ARE A QUICKLY THERE IN PLACE TO STOP LENGTH OF TIME THOSE PROGRAMS TAKE HOW SUCCESSFUL WE ARE. TO RECRUIT A BROAD AND DIVERSE SET OF CANDIDATES TO BE PART OF THE WORK FORCE SO EACH OF THESE THINGS IS WORTHY OF ITS OWN EVALUATION AND THEN. WE WILL LOOK TO EVALUATE THE ENTIRETY OF THE PROJECT OVER TIME THE EVALUATION IN MANY WAYS WILL BE MANIFEST- AS YOU SAID IT. DOWN THE ROAD WITH THE IMPACT AND DID THE CHANGE OF LIFE OPTIONS FOR YOUNG PEOPLE AND WE WILL BE MINDFUL OF THAT I THINK WE HAVE SOME TREMENDOUS- COLLEAGUES IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE STATE OF BOTH ACADEMIC AND OTHER EVALUATION GROUPS. THAT CAN SUPPORT AND HELP THE STATE AND THEN OF COURSE THERE WILL BE DEPARTMENT BY DEPARTMENT SPECIFIC EVALUATION COMPONENTS HERE AS WELL SO THAT IS CERTAINLY BEING WORKED OUT- NOW AND WILL FOLLOW. AND BE MODELED AROUND. THE SPECIFIC COMPONENTS. OF WHICH I LAID. OUT SEVEN KEY BUCKETS THAT EACH IN. EACH PART OF THAT WILL REQUIRE SOME OF THE UA- IT STEP MEASURE YOU WANT TO ADD TO THAT. YEAH I THINK JUST TO CLARIFY THERE IS- AT AT THE SECRETARY SAID THERE IS A RESPONSIBILITY TO LOOK AT PROCESS MEASURES AND TO SEE IF INDIVIDUAL PIECES ARE AFFECTED. BUT THEN THERE'S THIS INCREDIBLE OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE THE TIME TO LOOK AT HOW THEY ALL WORK TOGETHER- AND AS I THINK THAT'S KIND OF WHAT WE SEE IS THAT THE NECESSITY OF REALLY COORDINATING THE EVALUATION. TO REALLY LOOK AT ALSO- WHERE DO WE GO WHEN THE FIVE YEARS IS THAT WHERE DO WE SUSTAIN WHERE TO RECREATE FUTURE INVESTMENTS WHAT DID WE LEARN- AND REALLY HOPE THAT THAT THE FINDINGS FROM. A COORDINATED. EVALUATION FLEET. MORE POLICIES CHANGE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SOME. WE GOT ALL OF THE OLD COMPUTER TO PAN HAS SOME QUESTIONS AND AGAIN THE DOCTOR GOING EVERYBODY WE AT NOBODY AGREES NOBODY DISAGREES ABOUT THE PROBLEM- I THINK WHAT WE'LL JUST WE'LL JUST HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THE THIS THE SOLUTION THAT YOU'VE COME UP WITH DOCTOR PAN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- CARE EGGMAN AND- FREESHEET THE PRESENTATIONS I THINK WE COULD BUY SPEND ALL AFTERNOON ACTUALLY TALKING ABOUT THIS BUT- WILL. I KNOW WE HAVE MANY OTHER ITEMS. I DID A FEW QUESTIONS. AND AGAIN APPRECIATE THE PROPOSAL AND THE ADMINISTRATION'S. PLANS TO THE SAID FELL THIS- AND THE BASICALLY- SOCIALLY- THIS INVESTMENT AND CHILDREN'S MENTAL HEALTH. AND JUST VERY FIRST COMMENT THAT- YOU KNOW I UNDERSTAND THE EIGHT DELEO TALKED ABOUT YOU KNOW DO YOU FOLKS ALL CHILDREN OR SOME- JUST ESPECIALLY SINCE SEEMS LIKE A LOT OF THIS PROPOSALS BEING SCHOOL CENTERED- SOMEONE WHO USED TO BE A MEDICAL CONSULT FOR SCHOOL DISTRICT IT'S VERY HARD FOR A PUBLIC SCHOOL DISTRICT- TO. GO AND ACTUALLY ONLY OFFER SERVICES TO SOME OF THE STUDENTS THAT TENDER SCHOOL AND NOT TO OTHERS- AND- IT AND SORT OF AS WE SAY AT IS THIS WEEK SERVICE. OF THE SITE IS SOCIETY THAT OF PEOPLE HAVE UNIVERSAL ACCESS TO YOU KNOW TO PUBLIC EDUCATION WHETHER SOME FAMILIES PARTAKE OF THAT OR NOT- IS THE DIFFERENCE IT IS THEIR OWN DECISION BUT IF THEY DO- THAT- ALL STUDENTS HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TREATED EQUALLY HAVE EQUAL ACCESS TO- THE VERY SERVICES IN SCHOOL SO. I WOULD I GUESS I WOULD ARGUE AND AGREEMENT WITH THE ADMINISTRATION THAT WE SHOULD COME UP WITH A PROGRAM THAT- ESPECIALLY. THE PARTS THAT ARE- SCHOOL ORIENTED THAT THEY NEED TO BE UNIVERSAL AND NOT- NOT SUBDIVIDED ACCORDING TO WHETHER SHARON'S COVERAGE OR OTHER TYPES OF. METRICS- NOW. THANK YOUNG OF THE- SO WELL I GUESS ONE THINGS WOULD NOTE IN THIS PROPOSAL IS THAT IN THE END IT REALIZE IT TAKES TIME BUT- FOR EXAMPLE- THAT'S THE LIKE ONE OF THE CORE THINGS IS BEHAVIORAL. HEALTH SERVICES VIRTUAL PLATFORM. AND CERTAINLY I THINK THIS COULD BE A VERY IMPORTANT INVESTMENT BUT AND IT ALSO TAKES TIME TO DEVELOP. BUT ALSO MAKE NOTE THAT IT BEGINS IN TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE SO IF YOU TAKE A- HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT IS A NINTH GRADE WHO IS HAVING MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES BECAUSE OF. COVERAGE BABY GRADUATED FOR THE EVEN CAME ONLINE. AND GRADUATE AND PERHAPS NOT GOING TO COLLEGE BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO HELP THEM NOW I KNOW WE HAVE OTHER THINGS THAT WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO DO FOR THEM BUT- THE SITE SO I GUESS ONE QUESTION I HAVE AND I THINK THIS CAME OF THEIR PREVIOUS HEARING IS THAT'S WHY CERTAINLY APPRECIATE MANY INVESTMENTS ON THE ALL OF THE WORK FORCE PART AS WELL AS GOING TAKE TIME TO TRAIN PEOPLE AT CETERA- HOW. HOW DO YOU SEE STAGING AT A STAGING OUT DIFFERENT THINGS SO THAT WHAT WAS THE WHAT ABOUT THE KIDS RIGHT NOW WHO ARE SUFFERING MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES. AS A COVETED. ARE HOW YOU PLAN TO RUN BASICALLY STATES THINGS OUT SO THAT THEY CAN GET HELP EVEN AS WE'RE TRYING TO BUILD UP ITS INFRASTRUCTURE SO IN TERMS OF THE OVERALL BUDGET PROPOSALS AND I KNOW DOOR FOR EXAMPLE- WE HAD. THEIR PROPOSALS PUT FORTH IN CERTAIN REGIONS- FOR EDUCATION MENTAL HEALTH THAT MORE FUNDED THAT YOU KNOW THERE WAS ENOUGH MONEY FUND MALES HEALTH. SERVICE OVERSIGHT SO HOW DO YOU SEE ESSENTIALLY I MEAN PROGRAMS FOR. STUDENTS WHO NEED IT RIGHT NOW AND THEN PERHAPS THINKING ABOUT YOU KNOW HOW THAT SORT OF MERGES INTO EVENTUALLY INTO AN OVER TO FOUR YEARS THREE FOUR YEARS THAT WOULD TAKE TO BUILD INSTRUCTORS. SO TO CREATE THAT SYSTEM SO CAN YOU JUST SPEAK TO THAT PORTION OF- WHAT WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO TO HELP THE MORE IMMEDIATE NEEDS AND TELL THAT THEN EVENTUALLY MERGES OVER LET'S SAY OUR DEBT THIS INVESTMENT. AND OVER TO YOU KNOW THREE TO FIVE YEAR PERIOD TIME PERIOD AS THE OTHER INVESTMENTS ARE NOW COMING ONLINE TO BRING THOSE TOGETHER. AS THE RENT. UP THOUGHT OF OUR PLANNING ABOUT THAT. SIR OUR- BRANDON LET ME JUST BEFORE ANSWERING THAT QUESTION. JUST REALLY EMPHASIZE AND ENDORSE YOUR POINT ABOUT ALL YOUNG PEOPLE AND NOT JUST K. THROUGH TWELVE. OUR FOCUS IS ZERO TO TWENTY FIVE. THERE IS A DESPERATE NEEDWE SAW CLEARLY- IN OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES ARE OTHER CAMPUSES ARE OTHER- YOUNG PEOPLE EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY FIVE ARE. IN WORK AND IN EDUCATION WHO HAD A TREMENDOUS BURDEN AND WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH TOOLS. FOR THAT POPULATION TO REALLY SERVE THE NEEDS THAT THEY HAVE- SO- YOU KNOW THIS FOCUS ON. THAT ENTIRE SPAN AGE SPAN- AND UNDERSTANDING THAT WHAT WORKS FROM ZERO TO THREE IS QUITE DIFFERENT THAT WHAT WORKS FROM TWENTY TO TWENTY FIVE. AND A KNOWLEDGE GENE HOW NIMBLE AND THE TOTAL THESE TOOLS REALLY HAVE TO BE COME. OVER TIME AND THAT'S THE KEY PIECE IT WILL TAKE SOME TIME TO DEVELOP THESE PROPERLY. IN THE EVIDENCE BASED HIGH QUALITY SCALABLE WAY BUT IN THE MEANTIME WE DO HAVE. OTHER SOLUTIONS OTHER PROGRAMS THAT. EVEN IF SOMEWHAT POORLY COORDINATED BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF. DIFFERENT WAYS BEHAVIORAL HEALTH HAS BEEN DELIVERED ACROSS OUR STATE FOR YOUNG PEOPLE SOME COUNTIES WITH THE RICH MENU OF SERVICES IN ANOTHER COUNTY IS. NOT SO MANY. AND SO TAKING WHAT IS ALREADY IN PLACE AND LOOKING WHERE THOSE INVESTMENTS CAN BE MADE- SENATOR PAN YOU MENTIONED- THE IMPORTANCE OF- THE- BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INVESTMENTS IN SCHOOLS. WE HAD A JANUARY PROPOSAL THAT IS STILL PART OF. THE OVERALL BUDGET AND LOOKS TO CREATE MEANINGFUL PARTNERSHIPS BETWEEN MEDICAID MANAGED CARE PROGRAMS- COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. AS WELL AS SCHOOLS SO THAT THEY CAN IMMEDIATELY. BUILDING CONNECTIONS THE RELAY CHEN CHIPS THE IN. IS TO GET OUNG WITH NEEDS A MEETING CONNECTED I THINK WHAT WE RUN INTO CONSISTENTLY AND THIS IS THE HARD PIECE TO SOLVE OVERNIGHT IS THAT WORK FOR SHORTAGE THERE WILL BE CONTINUED TO BE WAIT FOR SOME OF THOSE PROFESSIONAL SERVICES SO. AS WE TURN TO INVESTING IN ADDITIONAL COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS REALLY BUILDING UP THEIR INFRASTRUCTURE THROUGH THIS PROPOSAL AND EVEN THOUGH SOME OF THE COMPONENTS WILL BE COMPLETE INTEL- YOU KNOW A YEAR OR TWO. DOWN THE ROAD WE CAN START TO TAKE PARTS OF THESE PROGRAMS AND PUT THEM INTO PLACE RIGHT AWAY WE'VE TALKED ABOUT POTENTIAL FOR BUILDING ON SOME OF THE EXISTING PLATFORMS WE HAVE ACCOUNTS HOPE. THAT EXISTS WAS BUILT UP FOR THE PANDEMIC THAT COULD BE INVESTED IN AND THEN OF COURSE AT THE PARENT DEPARTMENT OF MANAGED HEALTH CARE WE HAVE THE HELP LINE THEY COULD BE A RESOURCE AND WE'VE CONSIDERED ALL THAT CAN BE CALM AND EVOLVE INTO SOMETHING. THAT COULD BE IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE TO FAMILIES I DO THINK THOUGH THAT IT DOES- IT DOES TAKE TIME TO SCALE THE COMPREHENSIVE SOLUTIONS AND IN THE MEANTIME WE CAN MAKE SOME OF THESE INVESTMENTS AND I DO THINK THE WAY YOU DESCRIBED IT. IS EXACTLY RIGHT THAT WILL TAKE SOME OF THESE INVESTMENTS NOW AND ALLOW THEM TO FLOURISH AND BRAID INTO THE BROADER- PLANNED AS OUTLINED IN THIS PROPOSED. AND THEN- SO FOR EXAMPLE IT'S JUST THAT THIS BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES VIRTUAL PLATFORM IS THAT PLATFORM- CLOSER TO SAY AT. IS THERE A FOR CLASS THAT CURRENTLY EXISTS ARE WE ESSENTIALLY INVENTING IT AND THEN THE SECOND QUESTION IS THAT. THIS IS A PLATFORM YOU ENVISION THAT WOULD BE. AVAILABLE. MORE BROADLY LET'S SAY THAT YOU KNOW IT'S NOT JUST FOR LET'S A STATE OR LOCAL GAL SERVICES BUT A POTENTIALLY BE AVAILABLE MORE BROADLY AS A MENTAL HEALTH PLATFORM FOR OTHER- MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDERS AND SYSTEMS AND SO FORTH- IN TERMS OF HELPING DELIVER CARE SO IT NEEDS THIS. COULD THIS BE A PLATFORM ACTUALLY THAT AND SERVICE ALL PATIENTS NOT JUST FOR THE STATE PROGRAM SO I JUST AND MAYBE THAT'S EVEN FURTHER TO THE FUTURE BUT I WAS JUST WONDERING AS TO WHAT THE VISION FOR THIS PLATFORM IS THAT AND IS THERE AN EXISTING MODEL. THAT YOU'RE BASING THIS- PLATFORM IDEA ON OURS THIS- THAT'S ACTUALLY UP AND RUNNING RIGHT NOW OR IS THIS A IT IS AN INNOVATION THAT WERE TRYING TO BUILD ON A CREATE. HERE AND STATE. SO BOB IT IS BOTH RIGHT SO THERE ARE. TWO MODELS OF A PROGRAM LIKE THIS THERE IS SOME WORK IN THE UK AND THE DOG MORE COMPREHENSIVE MODEL- AND THAT YOU CAME OUT IT WAS REALLY. FOR COLLEGE AGE- HIGHER AT AGE- CITIZENS THERE IN THE UK AND THEN CANADA. HAS THE CLOSEST MODEL CHáVEZ. MARKETS STEP MODEL THAT ALLOWS THE TOOLS TO BE AVAILABLE TO ALLOW. PEOPLE ARE HARD TO STEP UP THEIR NEEDING CARE I THINK THE ISSUE HERE IN CALIFORNIA IS THAT THIS IS BROADLY AND WIDELY GOING TO BE AVAILABLE TO YOUNG PEOPLE TO YOUR POINT IS IT JUST FOCUSED ON PUBLIC PROGRAMS OR THOSE WHO HAVE ACCESS TO PUBLIC PROGRAMS NO IT IS MEANT TO BE AVAILABLE FOR ALL YOUNG PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA. WE KNOW AND I YOU KNOW AGAIN THAT PERSONAL EXPERIENCE WHERE- SOME INDIVIDUALS EVEN WITH THE BEST HEALTH COVERAGE OFTEN RUN INTO SOME OF THE MOST DIFFICULT CHALLENGES GETTING THE BAY FOR ALL HEALTH CARE AND SERVICES THAT OUR YOUNG PEOPLE NEED- EVEN EVEN HARDER SOMETIMES THAN THOSE WITHIN THE PUBLIC HEALTH AND PUBLIC BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SYSTEM SO REALLY MAKING SURE THAT THIS PLATFORM. IS THE GATEWAY OF THE FRONT DOOR FOR ALL YOUNG PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS CARE SO THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE HOPE WILL BUILD AND EVOLVE OVER TIME AND WILL REQUIRE ADOPTING CONVERSATIONS WITH PARTNERS NOT JUST. IN GOVERNMENT BUT ALSO WITHIN THE BROAD HEALTH PLAN AND. HEALTH- PROVIDER COMMUNITY- AND THEN- MAY JUST A FEW MORE COMMENTS- AT AN AS YET AND SAID REALIZE WE COULD SPEND ALL AFTERNOON TALKING ABOUT THIS- BUT- KNOWING THAT WE- DON'T HAVE THAT KIND OF TIME. YOU KNOW APPRECIATE THE INVEST IN THE WORK FORCE I WOULD MAKE NOTE THAT- DALY AS COMMENTS ABOUT ONGOING COSTS- IS SOMETHING THAT I. THINK WE NEED TO BETTER DEFINE- BECAUSE THE SERVICE WAY I MEAN THE REASON WE HAVE THE WORKFORCE WE HAVE IN BEHAVIORAL HEALTH YOU KNOW SOME OF ITS PIPELINE PERHAPS AND- THAT'S WHERE THE INVESTMENT IS GOING HERE. BUT I ALSO POINT OUT THAT. YOU CAN TRY TO GET MORE PEOPLE INTO THE PIPELINE. WHAT HOW MANY PEOPLE ACTUALLY ENTER AND THEN HOW WHAT THEY'LL DO WHEN THEY COME OUT THE PIPELINE DEPENDS ON THE LABOR MARKET WHAT THE WORKING CONDITIONS THEY HAVE. IN FACT I THINK IN A PREVIOUS HEARING I ALSO ASKED NOT ONLY ABOUT THE BUILDING THE PIPELINE BUT ALSO WHAT ARE WE DOING TO INCENTIVIZE. YOU KNOW WHAT IS THE OVERALL WORK FORCE THAT'S OUT THERE HOW MANY PEOPLE PERHAPS ACTUALLY HAVE THE SKILLS AND TRAINING. BUT ACTUALLY AREN'T IN THE FIELD ANYMORE BECAUSE THE WORKING SITUATION THAT THEY FIND THEMSELVES AND IT IS NOT ONE THAT THEY WERE INTERESTED IN OUR DEBT- THEY DECIDE TO FIND SOME OTHER. PASSED AND SO- AND IT'S ALL THAT SIR RELATED IT TO THE ON GOING COST PART BUT YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT IS THE YEAH PAY AND BENEFITS OF THE FEDERAL WORKFORCE THAT WE CAN FIND WAYS PEOPLE ARE ATTRACTED THOSE TO ENTER BUT ALSO PEOPLE TO STAY IN BE RETAINED. AND NOT EITHER MOVED TO OTHER STATES ARE GO YOU KNOW FINE PRINT YES. IT'S THAT ARE SO- SO I THINK YOU KNOW AS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE ON GOING COST PART. THE DAILY APPOINT OUT THAT IS A BIT ILL- I THINK WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT THAT BECAUSE WE CAN TRY TO GET MORE PEOPLE IN THE PIPELINE AND- WILL TAKE YEARS FOR PEOPLE TO GO THROUGH BUT WHEN THEY COME OUT. ARE THEY GOING TO FIND THE KIND OF JOBS. THE KIND OF WORK. THAT WE WANT THEM TO DO. AND ARE WE SUPPORTING THAT KIND OF WORK RIGHT- AND I THINK THOSE OF US ON PRIMARY CARE AND A DOCTOR TELL YOU AND I BOTH PRIMARY CARE PEDIATRICIANS. WE ALSO KNOW THAT PRIMARY CARE PEDIATRICS IS ONE THE LOWEST. PAID OF ALL THE SPECIALTIES AND- THEREFORE- YOU KNOW SOMETIMES A YOU HAVE PEOPLE NOT YEAH. CITING TO DO OTHER THINGS BECAUSE- BECAUSE THERE IS FOR THE SAME TRAINING THEY COULD HAVE OTHER REWARDS ALTHOUGH I'D LIKE TO THINK MANY OF US IN PEDIATRICS STICK TO OUR GUNS. DESPITE THAT- BUT I THINK IT IS SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT FROM THE WORKFORCE PERSPECTIVE NOT SIMPLY THE PIPELINE BUT ALSO THE- ENDPOINT. AND THEN I GUESS THE OTHER THING OUT ALSO JUST MENTION IS I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR LEADERSHIP THE SURGEON GENERAL AND- ISSUE OUT ASUS BUT WE ALSO OTHER MODELS AS WELL. THAT AND TERMS OF AGAIN MOVING THINGS QUICKLY FOR OUR STUDENTS ARE HERE FOR EXAMPLE MENTAL HEALTH FIRST AID. TRAINING EDUCATORS AND TECHNIQUES LIKE THAT SO. IT IS GOOD TO HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF IT. YOU KNOW- ASSESSMENT AS TO. WHAT TYPE OF SKILL SETS AND HOW WE EDUCATE AGAIN EDUCATORS AND SCHOOLS ARE. LOT FOR OTHER FOLKS- FOR SOME OF THESE OTHER TOOLS EVIDENCE BASED TOOLS NAY- AND HOW THEY COMPARE AS WELL IN TERMS OF. FAILED TO PROVIDE. BOTH A DEDICATION OF- OF. CHILDREN AND YOUTH WHO NEED MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. HELLO THERE IS THERE SOME OTHER TOOLS ALSO WE SHOULD BE CONSIDERING AS WELL IN TERMS OF DOING TRAININGS. FOR PEOPLE SO- SO THEY CAN GET SOME INITIAL HELP- THAT IS AS WE GET THEM TO- MELTZER SECTIONALS. SO AGAIN THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR PROPOSAL. OKAY THE- CAN THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND YES A- AT. I DON'T THINK ANYBODY IN THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH FIELD GOES IN TO THIS FIELD TO GET WEALTHY- BUT AT THE SAME TIME WE COME IN TO HELP PEOPLE. AND THERE IS NOTHING MORE FRUSTRATING. THAN TRYING TO HELP SOMEBODY AND NOT HAVING THE RESOURCES TO DO THAT- AND THAT'S ANOTHER THING THAT BURNS PEOPLE OUT VERY QUICKLY. EARLIER IN MY CAREER. YOU KNOW I MEAN WE HAD A LOT OF PEOPLE IN AND THE WORKING GROUP HOMES SO WE JUST GOT A CALL THAT BURNOUT FACTORIES BECAUSE YOU COULDN'T. YOU COULDN'T LAST A LONG NOW WE'VE BEEN THAT WE CLOSE THAT DOWN BUT WE I MEAN WE STILL HAVE. THE ISSUE OF KIDS WE STILL HAVE THE ISSUE OF WAY TOO HIGH- CASELOADS AND OUR CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM. AND THE LAW AND THE LACK OF JUST OF THE- AS YOU I WAS WE HAVE ALL STATED- THE LACK OF CAPACITY IN OUR SYSTEM MUST GROW. AND THAT THAT IN ITSELF CREATES A BETTER WORK ENVIRONMENT BEING ABLE TO REIMBURSE PEOPLE- AND HAVE THEM HAVE. A BRIGHT ENOUGH HOPE THAT THEY CAN ACTUALLY HELP SOMEBODY AND TO BE ABLE AND THROUGH THAT MAKE THE SYSTEM WORK- BUT THAT JUST. THAT WITH WITH A NICE RATE OF PAY IS- IS ALSO INCREDIBLY REWARDING. SO WE THANK YOU FOR THE WORK WE KNOW THAT THAT THERE'S MORE TO BE DONE WE LOOK FORWARD TO PARTNERING WITH YOU- I THINK WE ALL HAVE THE SAME GOAL IN MIND. IS TO REALLY INCREASE CAPACITY IN OUR SYSTEMS AND- AND TO MAKE SURE EVERY CHILD WHO GETS WHO NEEDS HELP KIDS THAT HELP. SO THAT EVERY. ADULT HAS A BUNCH BETTER SHOT AT BEING ABLE TO LIVE TO THEIR FULL POTENTIAL. AND WITH TAT I THINK WE'LL MOVE ON TO THE OFFICE OF STATEWIDE HEALTH PLANNING. AND- DIRECTOR LANDS BURKE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS ELIZABETH PLANS FOR. THE DIRECTOR OF THE OFFICE OF STATEWIDE HEALTH PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT. SO I WILL START WITH ISSUE ONE. WHICH IS AN AUGMENTATION OF THE SONG BROWN HEALTHCARE WORKFORCE PROGRAM. THIS REQUEST IS AN INCREASE OF FIFTY MILLION ONE TIME. AVAILABLE OVER SIX YEARS. FOR ADDITIONAL AWARDS TO FIND NEW PRIMARY CARE RESIDENCY PROGRAMS. THROUGH THE SONG BROWN HEALTH CARE WORKFORCE TRAINING PROGRAM. THE FUNDING IN PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE REQUESTED WOULD ALLOW FOR ADDITIONAL WARDS TO HOSPITALS AND CLINICS TO SUPPORT NEW PRIMARY RESIDENCY TRAINING PROGRAMS IN UNDERSERVED AREAS. WE ESTIMATE THIS FUNDING COULD SUPPORT UP TO TEN NEW PRIMARY CARE RESIDENCY PROGRAMS ANNUALLY. HOSPITALS THAT ARE NEW TO GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION CAN ALSO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF A HIGHER CAP ON MEDICARE REIMBURSEMENT TO LEVERAGE FEDERAL DOLLARS IN THE EXPANSION OF THE PRIMARY CARE WORKFORCE IN CALIFORNIA. THIS IS A CRITICAL EFFORT TO CONTINUE TO TRY TO MEET CALIFORNIA'S NEED FOR MORE PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS. SHOULD I GO ON TO THE OTHER ITEMS MADAM CHAIR- BUT BUT JUST BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW THAT THE- THE DEPARTMENT FINANCER EARLY- HAS ANYTHING ON THIS. I THINK IS A GOOD PROGRAM WILL SUPPORT. ON THE CAMPAIGN. THANK YOU AND APPRECIATE THIS INVESTMENT- SOMEONE WHO'S A FORMER- PROGRAM DIRECTOR RESIDENCY PROGRAM DIRECTOR IN THE PRIMARY CARE RESIDENCY PROGRAM. I DO APPRECIATE THIS INVESTMENT I THINK THE ONE THING I WOULD JUST KEEP IN MIND AND I APPRECIATE THAT THIS IS OVER. THE YEARS IS THAT YOUR TRAINING FOR A PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN IS- WAS FAMILY MEDICINE COUNTERMEASURES AND JON P. ASHES THREE YEARS. AND SO AS A PROGRAM DIRECTOR WHAT YOU DON'T WANT TO DO IS HAVE FUNDING THAT LETS YOU FIND SOMEONE FOR THE FIRST TWO YEARS AND THEN THEY DON'T HAVE A FOR THE THIRD YEAR. PLUS ALSO IN ORDER TO GET ACCREDITATION YOU NEED TO HAVE THAT BUILD THAT CAPACITY AS WELL- SO AND THAT TAKES SOME EFFORT AND WORK AS WELL SO- I HOPE YOU KNOW CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THAT THIS ISN'T YEP THAT THAT FIRST OF ALL IT'S OVER I THINK SIX YEARS HE SAID. AND SO THAT THAT SO WE'RE REALLY TALKING AND THINKING ABOUT TERMS OF RESIDENCY CLASSES SO ESSENTIALLY SINCE IT'S THREE YEARS THAT MEANS. MAYBE IT THAT THEY'LL GET THROUGH THREE- FOR RESIDENCY CLASSES AND THEN PERHAPS WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT HOW WE EXTEND THIS BECAUSE OTHERWISE WHAT HAPPENS POSITIONS WITHIN HAVE TO GO AWAY NOT IN SIX YEARS BUT ACTUALLY A FEW YEARS BEFORE. BECAUSE AS THE RESIDENTS ARE GOING THROUGH YOU HAVE TO BE SURE YOU CAN ASSURE FUNDING. THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRETY OF TRAINING NOT JUST A PORTION OF TRAINING- SO HOPE JUST THAT. THREE POINT TO KEEP THAT IN MIND AS WE THINK ABOUT THE FUNDING FOR- FOR THESE RESIDENCY PROGRAMS AND I APPRECIATE THAT SEEMS LIKE THAT THOUGHT WAS. PUT IN THIS PROPOSAL. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR PER YES THE FOCUS IS ON YOUR- CARE RESIDENCY PROGRAMS IN PART BECAUSE- THE WAITED TO BRING A NEW MEDICARE DOLLARS TO SUPPORT THE PROGRAMS IS WITH- WITH THE NEW RESIDENCY PROGRAMS. OKAY THANK YOU. LET'S MOVE ON THEN TO ISSUE NUMBER TWO JERRY AT GERIATRIC CAKES CARE WORK FORCE PROGRAM YES SO THIS IS A REQUEST FOR A FIVE MILLION ONE TIME INCREASE. AVAILABLE OVER SIX YEARS TO AUGMENT THE THREE MILLION ONE TIME GENERAL FUND PROPOSED AT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET FOR GERIATRIC WORKFORCE PROGRAMS. THE TOTAL AWARDS FUNDING REQUESTED WILL UTILIZE EXISTING WORKFORCE PROGRAMS ADDING ADDITIONAL CAREER EXPLORATION PIPELINE SCHOLARSHIP AND LOAN REPAYMENT AWARDS TO EXISTING PROGRAMS TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF GERIATRIC CARE PROVIDERS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. SO USING CURRENT PROGRAMS WILL ENABLE US TO LEVERAGE EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE INCREASE AWARDS GERONTOLOGIST AND OTHER GERIATRIC CARE PROVIDERS MORE QUICKLY. THAN DEVELOPING A NEW PROGRAM. THANK YOU ILIO ANYTHING. A CORE ISSUE DAILY AND WE HAVE NO COMMENTS TO REASONS. THANK YOU DEPARTMENT FINANCE. NO COMMENTS THANKS OKAY- WE ALL KNOW THIS NEEDS TO INCREASE OUR WORKFORCE HERE DOCTOR PAN ANYTHING ON THIS ONE OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH OKAY LET'S THEN MOVE ON. SO ISSUE THREE IS OXFORD FORTUNE OF THE CALIFORNIA CHILDREN YOUTH BEHAVIORAL HALTH INITIATIVE WHICH SECRETARY GALLEY GAVE SUCH A IMPASSIONED- INEFFECTIVE OVERVIEW OF SO I'LL JUST QUICKLY GO THROUGH ASHRIDGE PIECES. THE WASHINGTON IS REQUESTING A TOTAL OF NINE HUNDRED MILLION ONE TIME DOLLARS OVER THREE YEARS OF THIS AMOUNT SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION IS ONE TIME CORONAVIRUS FISCAL RECOVERY FUNDS AND THE REST WOULD BE GENERAL FUND. AND THIS PROPOSAL WOULD SUPPORT BEHAVIORAL HEALTH WORKFORCE EDUCATION AND TRAINING. THROUGH BOTH THE US HAS EXISTING HEALTH WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW PROGRAMS WE'RE FOCUSING ON THREE MAIN GOALS INCREASING A BEHAVIORAL HEALTH WORKFORCE IT IS CULTURALLY AND LINGUISTICALLY PROFICIENT AND CAPABLE OF PROVIDING AGE APPROPRIATE SERVICES TO CHILDREN YOUTH AND FAMILIES. EXPANDING TRAINING FOR EXISTING BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS AND TARGETING PROFESSIONALS IN MEDICALLY UNDERSERVED AREAS AND POPULATIONS. SO OUR FIRST PIECE OF THIS WOULD CREATE A SCHOOL BEHAVIORAL HEALTH COACH AND COUNSELOR WORKFORCE. THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACCOUNTABILITY AND OVERSIGHT COMMISSION'S RECENT REPORT OUTLINED THE NEED TO CREATE SCHOOLS AS CENTRES OF WELLNESS AND AGAIN SECRETARY KELLY TALKED ABOUT THIS. THE REPORT EMPHASIZED THAT UNMET MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS CREATE LEARNING BARRIERS FOR SCHOOL AGE CHILDREN. TO ESTABLISH SCHOOLS AS CENTRES OF WELLNESS CALIFORNIA NEEDS TRAINED BEHAVIORAL HEALTH COUNSELORS AND COACHES TO PROVIDE A VARIETY OF INTERVENTIONS AND ASSIST EDUCATORS AND IMPROVING EDUCATIONAL OUTCOMES. APRIL HELPED AND COUNSELORS ARE ALSO VITAL TO IMPLEMENTING THE COMMUNITY SCHOOLS MODEL WHERE SCHOOLS ARE FOR A WIDE ARRAY OF SUPPORTS AND SERVICES FOR STUDENTS AND FAMILIES. FROM HEALTH AND MENTAL HEALTH TO FAMILY SUPPORTS FOR FOOD. AND SUCH ABUSE. PRICE CENTER OF AND HOW. SO WE'RE- WE'RE WE'RE LOOKING TO HAVE THESE. AND COACHES HELP PROVIDE CHILLED YOU. A IN HOW WHERE AN WHEN THEY RECEIVE SERVICES INCLUDING VERGE SIR THAT. THAT SIX PRIVACY IN PROVIDE ANONYMITY THROUGH THE PORTAL THAT WAS ALREADY DISCUSSED. DURING THE INITIAL YEAR ASHKHABAD IN PARTNERSHIP WITH SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS INCLUDING EDUCATION BEHAVIORAL HEALTH WOULD DEVELOP A MULTI YEAR PLAN TO LAUNCH AND IMPLEMENT THE SCHOOL BEHAVIORAL HEALTH COACH AND COUNSELOR SYSTEM. ANOTHER BIG COMPONENT OF OFSTED'S PIECE WOULD BE THE DEVELOPMENT OF SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER ASIDE WORKFORCE SO CALIFORNIA CONTINUES TO EXPERIENCE A SHORTAGE OF SUCH COUNSELORS AND CLINICIANS. SO RECOGNIZING THIS NEED. WE'RE LOOKING TO DEVELOP THE SAID WORKFORCE THAT PROVIDES AGE APPROPRIATE TREATMENT. IF LINE OF SIGHT COUNCILLOR ISN'T SPECIALIST REFLECT THE DIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AND CHILDREN YOUTH AND FAMILIES TO HELP GET FROM THE TREATMENT THEY NEED IN A MANNER THAT IS CULTURALLY AND LINGUISTICALLY PROFICIENT. SO WE'RE SEEKING TO DEVELOP A CULTURALLY COMPETENT SAID WORKFORCE THAT EXPANDS THE KNOWLEDGE OF EXISTING LICENSE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CLINICIANS TO PROVIDE AGE APPROPRIATE SUCH TREATMENT. AS WELL AS AN INVESTING SUBSTANTIALLY TO ADDRESS SIGNIFICANT WORK FORCE AND DIVERSITY SHORTAGES BY PROVIDING FINANCIAL SUPPORT TO INDIVIDUALS ENTERING SIDE CAREERS. SO IN THIS BUDGET YEAR WE WOULD COLLABORATE WITH SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS AND STAKEHOLDERS TO DEVELOP A NEW SAID WORKFORCE FRAMEWORK AND THEN PLAN FOCUSED ON YOUTH AND FAMILIES. ANOTHER PIECE OF THE PROPOSALS WOULD EXPAND TRAINING CAPACITY FOR PSYCHIATRY AND SOCIAL WORK- AGAIN WHERE WE SEE RESEARCH THAT ONE OF THE LARGEST BEHAVIORAL HEALTH WORKFORCE NEEDS ARE IN PSYCHIATRY ESPECIALLY CHILD AND ADOLESCENT PSYCHIATRY PUBLIC MENTAL HEALTH NURSE PRACTITIONERS AND SOCIAL WORKERS. ARE PROPOSAL WOULD PROVIDE FUNDING TO SUPPORT AND GROW RESIDENCY IN TRAINING PROGRAMS THAT DEVELOP THIS NEEDED WORKFORCE WE'RE LOOKING TO BUILD ON EXISTING PROGRAMS SUCH AS THE WET PSYCHIATRIC EDUCATION CAPACITY EXPANSION PROGRAM. AND THAT PROGRAM TO TRAIN NON PRESCRIBING CLINICIANS AND CHILD AND ADOLESCENT SOCIAL WORKERS AND CHILD WELFARE WORKERS. WE ARE ALSO LOOKING TO BUILD THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH WORKFORCE PIPELINE. THE FUTURE HEALTH WORKFORCE COMMISSION REPORT HIGHLIGHTED THE NEED TO BUILD A PIPELINE OF HEALTHCARE WORKERS. THIS PROPOSAL WILL BUILD ON EXISTING PROGRAMS SUCH AS ARE MANY GRANTS PROGRAM TO SUPPORT CAREER EXPLORATION AND SUSTAIN AND BUILD PIPELINE PROGRAMS THAT PROVIDE MENTORSHIP AND ACADEMIC CAREER AND PSYCHO SOCIAL SUPPORTS TO PREPARE STUDENTS FROM UNDERREPRESENTED AND LOW INCOME BACKGROUNDS. FOR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CAREERS- AND THEN WE'RE LOOKING TO BUILD EARN AND LEARN APPRENTICESHIP MODELS. TO HELP PROVIDE A PATHWAY TO A JOB FOR TO LEARN MODELS HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO BE EFFECTIVE IN TRAINING AND PLACING INDIVIDUALS AND NEEDED OCCUPATIONS. THESE MODELS PROVIDE TUITION SUPPORT AN ON THE JOB TRAINING AT A BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PROVIDER ORGANIZATIONS WHILE THE PARTICIPANTS ATTEND POST SECONDARY SCHOOLS WORK COMPLETE TRAINING. LAWYERS PROVIDE A POSITION FOR THE GRADUATE AND THEN THERE'S A PERIOD OF SERVICE OBLIGATION. THE PROGRAM WOULD PROVIDE FINANCIAL SUPPORT TO THE IMPLIED EMPLOYER TO SUPERVISE AND MENTOR THE STUDENTS. HAVE PROSPERED WOULD LEVERAGE THIS MODEL AND WORK WITH SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS TO DEVELOP A PLAN TO BUILD THE WORKFORCE FOR THESE COUNSELORS. INCLUDING FOR UNLICENSED BUT TRAINED PROFESSIONALS. THERE IS A FOCUS BUT INCLUDE COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS AND PSYCHO SOCIAL REHABILITATION SPECIALIST THAT SERVE CHILDREN YOUTH AND FAMILIES. GIVEN THE SIGNIFICANT WEALTH GAP ALONG RACIAL LINES THIS IS AN IMPORTANT APPROACH TO HELP DIVERSIFY CALIFORNIA'S BEHAVIORAL HEALTH WORKFORCE- AND THEN WE HAVE A GOAL AROUND EXPANDING TRAINING FOR EXISTING BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS. SO WERE ONE IS FOCUSED ON ENHANCING TRAINING TO SERVE JUSTICE AND SYSTEM INVOLVED YOUTH. THAT PROPOSAL WOULD DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT ENHNCED TRAINING TO EXISTING AND NEW STAFF ACROSS A VARIETY OF SECTORS INCLUDING CHILD WELFARE EDUCATION AND PROBATION ON EFFECTIVE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH STRATEGIES WITH JUSTICE AND SYSTEM INVOLVED YOUTH AND PREVENTING SUCH INVOLVEMENT AMONG HIGH RISK VULNERABLE YOUTH AND THEIR FAMILIES FAMILIES. IMPLEMENT THESE TRAININGS ARE SPREAD WOULD CONSULT WITH RELEVANT STATE DEPARTMENTS AND ORGANIZATIONS AS NECESARY TO DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT A PLAN TO PROVIDE THIS TRAINING. THE SECOND PROPOSAL WOULD EXPAND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH TRAINING FOR PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS THROUGH OUR TRAINING NEW TRAINER PSYCHIATRY FELLOWSHIP THE- TRAIN NEW TRAINERS PSYCHIATRY FELLOWSHIP SCHOLARSHIP SO THIS CURRENT PROGRAM WOULD BE EXPANDED TO INCLUDE PEDIATRICIANS AND OTHER PROVIDERS SERVING CHILDREN AND YOUNG ADULTS. THE PROGRAM PROVIDES TRAINING TO EXISTING PRIMARY CARE STAFF TO DIRECTLY SERVE RATHER THAN REFER FOR MODERATE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CONDITIONS. HI MERRY CARE PROVIDERS CONTINUE TO BE A PRIMARY SOURCE FOR MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT. PROVIDING ADEQUATE TRAINING ON BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ISSUES TO THESE PROVIDERS THIS PRODUCT IS A CRITICAL COMPONENT TO THE INTEGRATED TEAM MODEL OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. AND THEN THERE TO LAST PIECES THAT I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT- FOCUSED ON. TARGETING PROFESSIONALS IN MEDICALLY UNDERSERVED AREAS AND POPULATIONS ONE WOULD BE TO EXPAND THE CARE PERSONNEL TRAINING AND PLACEMENT PROGRAMS- SO WE'VE SEEN THE FUTURE HEALTH WORKFORCE COMMISSION REPORT HIGHLIGHTS THE NEED FOR FRONT LINE WORKERS TO CONTRIBUTE TO ADDRESSING CALIFORNIA'S WORKFORCE CHALLENGES RELATED TO SUPPLY DIVERSITY. AND GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION. TELL HEALTH SYSTEMS WE'RE SEEKING TO EXPAND THIS PROGRAM BY TRAINING UP TO TWO THOUSAND YOUR PERSONNEL BUILDING A DIVERSE WORKFORCE THAT SUPPORTS IMPROVED HEALTH OUTCOMES AND PROMOTES RECOVERY AND SELF SUFFICIENCY. WE ARE ALSO SEEKING TO TRAIN UP TO TWELVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY PAIR PERSONNEL TO FOCUS ON TRANSITION AGE YOU. THESE INDIVIDUALS WILL FILL AN IMPORTANT GAP IN THE WORK FORCE TO WORK WITH AT RISK YOUTH. AND THEN FINALLY WE'RE LOOKING TO AUGMENT OUR EXISTING LOAN REPAYMENT SCHOLARSHIP AND STIPEND PROGRAMS TO SUPPORT BEHAVIORAL HEALTH- DISCIPLINES. THOSE PIECES ARE ALL OUTLINED IN YOUR- IN IN THE AGENDA- HAPPY ANSWER ANY OF YOUR QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS AND I'M JOINED A STEPHANIE WELCH OF COURSE IS STILL HERE AS IS KAREN RISE L. R. WORKFORCE DEPUTY DIRECTOR- BUT I REALLY WOULD NOTE THAT THEY DESERVE A LOT OF CREDIT FOR PUTTING THIS. PROPOSAL TOGETHER I'M TRYING TO LEVERAGE JOSH BECAUSE EXISTING PROGRAMS AND REALLY FEEL THE NEED AND RED MEAT THIS UNIQUE MOMENT IN TIME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ANYTHING. ANDERSON SHEFFIELD FINANCED A COMMON THING THANK YOU MISTER SHE DON'T THE SEER HAND UP. THANK YOU SENATOR A MAN- OR YOU SEE IT AGAIN WITH THE L. A. I'LL BE BRIEF WITH THE ARE COME ON THIS YOU KNOW FOR THIS. OF THAT SHE AND YOUTH BEHAVIOR HEALTH INITIATIVE YOU KNOW SIMILAR TO LIKE A THE CALL THAT WE ON- ON THE OVER INITIATIVE THAT WE RELEASE THE IN. OF DESIGNING IN EFFECT THE VALUE STRAIGHT FOR THESE. YOU KNOW- SO OF THIS IS GOING TO A ON EDWARD PRO AND SOME OF THAT IS GOING TO STAB NEW. YOU KNOW GIVEN THAT THE STATE GENERALLY IS NOT SORT HAD A CLUE PICTURE OF THE NAY OF A- WORKFORCE WITH AN ARCHED AND YOU KNOW WE WOULD. THIS YOU KNOW- INSIDERY ABOUT THE VALUE. IS OF THIS FUNDING- THE NEW. AS WELL AS POTENTIAL SORT OF REFINED THAT CAN BE MADE. I TO EXISTING. JOSH EXISTING PROGRAMS ALREADY SORE OF GAME A CLEARER PICTURE OF. WHETHER THERE ARE- SPECIFIC OUTCOME. METRICS HAVE BEEN RE AS A- OF- OF THESE INVESTMENTS. THOSE ARE ALL OUR COMMENTS AT THIS TIME HAPPY TO PROVIDE. ASSIST FOR NEEDED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- I GUESS I'M I WOULD JUST FIRST I'M YOU KNOW WE JUST KEEP THIS ENOUGH THAT THAT WHEN SOMEONE IS TRAINED WORKFORCE ISSUES REMAIN- HUGE AT AT JOB RETENTION BE ABLE TO KEEP PEOPLE AND- AND I GUESS I DON'T HAVE AS MANY QUESTIONS ABOUT AND AGAIN YOU KNOW ALL OF THIS WILL NEED MORE DETAIL BUT- OF THE- EXISTING. PROFESSIONS AS WE KNOW ON. BUT I GUESS I AM I AM INTERESTED IN KNOWING YOUR IDEAS ABOUT WHO ARE THESE HEALTH COACHES AND COUNSELORS. AND WHO ARE THESE- EARN AND LEARN FOLKS. WITH THE APPRENTICESHIP MODEL I GUESS THAT MAKES A LOT MORE SENSE TO ME- BECAUSE WHAT RECOMMEND WE ALREADY HAVE A NOT ENOUGH. BEHAVIOR HEALTH FOLKS NOW SILICON CREATING. NEW NEW- AND AS WHO SERVED ON MY BUSINESS A PROFESSION FOR A LONG I CAN TELL SCOPA THEN BE THAT BECOMES A BATTLE AND- DO WHAT- AND THEN MY OTHER ISSUE ALSO IS. IN THIS FOR A WHILE IS A ISSUE OF IT WILL TO CREATE THESE NEW. ARE WE ALSO GONNA THEN DO COURSE. INVESTMENT IN OUR HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEM OTHERWISE WE ARE ASKING THE FOR PROFIT COLLEGE SYSTEM THAT IS OUT THERE AND THRIVING TO CREATE TO CREATE ALL THESE AND PROVIDE THE EDUCATION AND SEND ARE PROBABLY LOWER WAGE EARNERS IN OUR BEHAVIOR HEALTH SENTENCE. SYSTEM INTO HIGHER RATES OF DEATH SO CAN YOU TALK ABOUT WHO ARE THESE COACHES AND COUNSELORS. AND EARN AND LEARN WHICH PEOPLE. THANK MADAM CHAIRMAN SEE IF THAT DIRECTOR WELSH TO THAT THAT SECRETARY WELSH WANTS TO- TALK ABOUT THE A LITTLE AND WERE HAPPY ADD ON THIS NEEDED. ABSOLUTELY AND- SO WE WERE LOOKING AT MY THAT ARE AND IN A OF PLACES BUT THE PRINCIPLE ACTUALLY BOTH THE COACHES AS AS THEIR AND LEARN MODEL IS TO HAVE A LOW BARRIER TO ENTRY INTO THE WORK FOR AND FOR US TO RECRUIT UNDERSERVED THAT COULDN'T THANK COME INTO THIS WORK FOR AND BROUGHT THE CULTURAL LINGUIST AND. FIRST THAT WE NEED IN OUR WORK CENTER A CULTURE REALLY AT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE IT WAS. THAT IT WAS THE AS COMMUNITY HEALTH WHERE IN WASN'T THIS. NEXT AS A HERE BECAUSE THE THING THAT MAKE THEM YOU NEED WOULD BE THE SPECIFIC INTO TRAINING THAT THEY GET TO READ IN. AND SUPPORT CHILDREN AND USE SAID THAT- I TO BE SPECIFIC ALSO AS A SOCIAL SPEAKING TO YOU THIS IS A I'M LICENSE- YOU KNOW ENVISIONED AND I'M LIKE. BUT TRAIN AND HIGHLY. WORK FORCE AND KIND OF SEVEN TO AN EARLY LEARN MY- THIS MODEL ONLY WORK AS- IF WE'RE GOING TO RECRUIT FROM COMMUNITIES- ARE CURRENTLY AS REPRESENT IN OUR- WOULD BE- ASSEMBLY NET THE PROVIDE A STATE. PROVIDED AT. PERFECT NINE SHIP- AND IT ENDS. IN ATTENTION JOBS. BUT AGAIN THE THING WOULD MAKE A GIVE ME. WOULD BE THE THEY- HAD THE OF IN THE OPERA. AT NO COST AND- TO GET THIS IN TEN TRAINING. THAT MAKE THEM. ABLE TO WORK VERY AFFECT WITH CHILDREN I THINK PROBABLY SO THAT YOU HEARD AND I HEARD IT IN PRETTY HEARINGS IS THAT. WE SIMPLY A YES WE HAVE A WORKFORCE DEFICIT ALL AROUND THAT'S- WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THAT TWO DECADES pHAVE A DENTIST IN TERMS OF A FEW REALLY YOU TO NOT ONLY A- BUT YOU'RE REALLY WERE WITH CHAU AND THEIR- AND SO OF THIS IS A THAT WILL. REALLY NEED TO BE DEBT IN THE A BEING THE WITH THE EXTRA AND- OF OUR AT. PART AS WELL AS OUR PART IN ADVOCATE TO TWELVE. AND SO WE STARTED THOSE COME. WE RECKON THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IS A VISION THAT WE HAVE THAT IS QUOTING NEW AND IT WILL. SOME SOME PLANNING BECAUSE WE WANT AGAIN THE SYSTEMS YOU UTILIZE THESE. BE. SIX YEARS CANCERS IT COULD REPRESENT SOMEBODY WHO HAS THEIR ABLE HAS HAS GRADUALLY FROM US WORK PROGRAM AND TO BECOME A CASE MAY. IT'S AT THE END IS THAT THESE ARE INDEED WHO. WOULD HAVE A AND- A STRONGER SKILL SET SO SPEAK OR A MORE SKILL SET DEBT AT YOU KNOW SINCE A CO COULD. DO A WARM HAND OFF TO OR. FOR TO. AND ANOTHER- QUESTION THAT WE'VE GOTTEN ABOUT THE KIND. OF REALLY RAPIDLY BEATING TO PRODUCE A WORK FORCE THAT CPAS. HAS STILL SETS TO WITH YOU YOUNG OF FAMILY- CHIU YOUTH AND- WHAT BE THAT AS- THEY WOULD YEAH. AND SEE AND APPLY FOR A JOB IN AN EDUCATIONAL SETTING THEY MAY CHOOSE TO WORK IN A SMALL CBO OR MAYBE IT WAS EVEN THE CBO WHERE THEY DID THEIR INTERNSHIP- MAYBE THEY CHOOSE TO WORK FOR COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH I THINK- OUR CONCEPT AROUND THIS POPULATION IS TO PRODUCE- I DON'T SEE A NEW GENERATION BUT HOPEFULLY A LARGE GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO. MAY NOT NECESSARILY HAVE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY- HAD MAYBE EVEN CONSIDERED GOING INTO- THE BEHAVIOR HEALTH CARE FIELD BUT THAT IT CAN BE A REWARDING AND ALSO FINANCIALLY AS- AS- WELL I DO WANT SAY FINISH REWARDING BUT STILL EIGHT EIGHT GOOD JOB A GOOD PAYING JOB. AND IT'S EVERYTHING FROM SOMETHING THAT'S MORE ENTRY LEVEL TO. A JOB THAT PROVIDES MANY OPPORTUNITIES INCLUDING RETURNING TO SCHOOL AND GETTING ADDITIONAL LICENSURE- AND SO THAT'S REALLY OUR VISION AND WE DO THINK THAT THIS IS SOMETHING. REALLY WANT TO WORK WITH OUR EDUCATIONAL PARTNERS ON TO HELP- NOT ONLY IDENTIFY EXISTING. STUDENTS MAY BE GETTING READY TO GRADUATE AND MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN IN IN BEING A PART OF A PROGRAM WHERE THEY COULD GET SOME INTENSIVE TRAINING AND BE MORE WORK FORCE READY- TO THE WAYS IN WHICH WE CAN PARTNER WITH- OUR LOCAL COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND OTHER TRAINING ENTITIES. TO RAPIDLY TRAINED INDIVIDUALS EFFECTIVELY TO HAVE THIS UNIQUE SKILL SET. SO I THINK. THAT ANSWERED MOST OF. YOUR QUESTIONS ON THAT. YEAH AND YOU AND AN- AND WE BOTH KNOW THIS IS A MEMBER OPTIMISTIC AND THIS IS I MEAN THIS I A- THAT THIS IS THIS I SEE IT. RIGHT I SEE THE I SEE THE OPTIMISM AND I SEE THE- THE DREAM BUT- AND I SEE A LOT OF LAND MINES IN IN BETWEEN THE IMPLEMENTATION AND JUST A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE ABOUT THE SUBSIDIES ARE ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT KATE ACT PEOPLE THAN CERTIFICATION ARE YOU TALKING. THEY'RE ALSO ABOUT A RANGE OF- IT IS A CAREER PATH I GUESS I GUESS IS THAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT AND THEN IF WE IF WE DO THAT. THEN AGAIN THIS ISSUE OF PAY BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT WE DON'T WANT TO CREATED A WHOLE. GREAT PEOPLE THAT ARE VASTLY UNDERPAID- SOMEBODY WITH A DEGREE AND THEN. SO ANY ANY POTENTIALLY MIGHT BE A QUESTION FOR KAREN- WE'RE KIND OF THINKING THROUGH THE PROCESS THAT WE'RE GOING TO EMBARK ON IN ORDER TO REALLY EXAMINE HOW TO BUILD OUT THE SUBSTANCE USE WORKFORCE THAT WE NEED AND WOULD THAT BE SOMETHING THAT KAREN COULD SPEAK TO. BUSINESS RESULTS. PLEASE. GOOD AFTERNOON- WELL I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT AND SPECIFICALLY AROUND THAT- AS YOU THE WORK FORCE IS HOW TO BUILD A CAREER LADDER AND SO I THINK THAT- BECAUSE WE RECOGNIZE THAT WE WANT TO BUILD A PATHWAY- FROM THE LOWER- ENTRY LEVEL POSITIONS AND A HIGHER LEVEL POSITION SO THAT'S ONE OF THE KEY PIECES OUT OF THIS OUR PROPOSAL IS REALLY DEVELOPING THAT CAREER LADDER. SO WE'RE NOT WE'RE NOT QUITE SURE ABOUT. SO THAT WE'RE WE'RE STILL WE'RE STILL WORKING OUT A LOT OF THE DETAILS OF IT. BUT BUT I BUT I WOULD CONCUR WITH YOUR GOAL OF. TRYING TO CREATE SOME KIND OF WORKFORCE LADDER- THROUGH THIS AND MAKING SURE THAT WE PARTNER WITH OUR- INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER LEARNING SO WE HAVE THE TRAINING- EASILY AND AVAILABLE TO PEOPLE- AND- AND WE KNOW IT. IT IT'S A LOT OF YEARS AND AN EDUCATION TO GET A- AN ADVANCED DEGREE. BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT WE'RE WORKING WITH HUMAN BEINGS AND SO IT'S IT IS VERY ALSO DELICATE WORK AND WHAT WE WANT TO. EXPAND IT TO MORE PEER SUPPORT WE- WE ALSO LEARNED THAT COMES WITH SOME LIABILITIES AS WELL SO SUPERVISION WOULD HAVE TO BE AT A- HUGE COMPONENT. OF THIS SO. I'M A LOT STILL T BE DETERMINED BUT WE THANK YOU DOCTOR PAN. THANK YOU TRACK MAN- BUT YOU KNOW- AFTER THAT I AM A LITTLE THIN I STILL HAVE SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS- AFTER HEARING THE ANSWER FROM- ARGUMENT AND- NO JUST RESPECTFULLY- YOU KNOW HONORED TO BE WORKING WITH A CHAIR WHO HAS A DEGREE IN SOCIAL WORK AND ADVANCED DEGREE IN SOCIAL WORK BY MYSELF. NOT ONLY A PHYSICIAN BUT I'VE DONE ADVANCED TRAINING AND BEHAVIOR DEVELOPMENT- AND OF COURSE I ALSO RAN A TRAINING PROGRAM FOR- PEDIATRICIANS AS A PROGRAM DIRECTOR. AND SO AS AN EDUCATOR I'M HEARING SOME OF YOUR ANSWERS AND IT'S ACTUALLY MAKING ME VERY CONCERNED. BECAUSE I'LL TELL YOU AS A PROGRAM DIRECTOR SO I GET PEOPLE WHO GRADUATE FROM MEDICAL SCHOOLS THEY'VE HAD FOUR YEARS OF COLLEGE FOUR YEARS OF MEDICAL SCHOOL THERE. PRIDED PRETTY WELL IN COLLEGE TO GET THE MEDICAL SCHOOL SAID PRETTY TALENTED PEOPLE. AND YOU KNOW THEY SHOW UP AND WE'RE GOOD AND WE- HAVE THEM GO TAKE CARE OF PATIENTS BUT WE DON'T TO SOMEONE TO TAKE CARE OF PATIENTS WE KEEP A VERY CLOSE EYE ON THEM- BECAUSE- IT'S HARD WORK. AND IT'S NOT JUST DIFFICULT- THE CONSEQUENCES ARE SIGNIFICANT IF THEY MAKE MISTAKES. ARE IF THEY'RE WRONG. AND SO THESE ARE PEOPLE THAT REALLY GOING TO EIGHT YEARS OF TRAINING AND BY THE WAY EVEN WHEN THEY'RE FINISHED THEY'RE ADDITIONAL THREE YEARS OF- IN PERSON EXPERIENCE- THEY'RE STILL NOT QUALIFIED TO TRAIN THIS. AS AN EXPERT AND SPECIALIST IN- BEHAVIOR DEVELOPMENT THAT'S ANOTHER THREE YEARS OF TRAINING. AND I ALSO MAKE NOTE THAT ONE OF YOUR TRAINING PROGRAMS HERE'S ACTUALLY TO TAKE THESE VERY SAME PEOPLE WHO'VE GONE THROUGH THAT MUCH TRAINING- FOUR YEARS FOUR YEARS OF COLLEGE FOUR YEARS OF MEDICAL SCHOOL THREE YEARS OF RESIDENCY. AND SAY THAT- BY THE WAY YOU NEED EVEN MORE TRAINING TO TAKE CARE OF MODERATE BEHAVIOR HEALTH CONDITIONS. AND ACTUALLY YOU KNOW THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY AN ACCURATE BECAUSE THE SONG IS ACTUALLY DONE MY FELLOWSHIP TRAINING. THE THING THAT I REALIZE IS THAT IT'S YOU KNOW BEHAVIORAL HEALTH IS SOME YOU KNOW IT'S NOT SIMPLE. IT'S CHALLENGING. AND SO THE QUESTION STARTS TO RAISES THAT NOT I GET YOU KNOW WE'RE TRYING TO BUILD UP THE WORK FORCE IS THAT THESE HEALTHCOACHES AND COUNSELORS YOU YOU TALK ABOUT INTENSIVE TRAINING BUT THEY'RE UNLICENSED. SO THAT SEEMS TO BE AN OXYMORON. HOWARD INTENSIVELY TRAINED I MEAN I GUESS WE KEEP WE DON'T HAVE THE STAFF TO GIVE A LICENSE FOR INTENSIVE TRAINING BUT HOW DO YOU SAY DON'T TENTATIVELY TRAINED. AND DOESN'T NECESSARY HAVE TO LEAD TO LICENSE SO WHAT IS THIS INTENSIVE TRAINING HOW MANY YEARS HOW MANY HOURS OF TRAINING IS INTENSIVE TRAINING BEFORE WE UNLEASH THEM. ONTO A BUNCH OF. STUDENTS AND CHILDREN IN SCHOOLS. RIGHT AND- I'LL TELL YOU AGAIN AS A AS A AS AN AT THE HOUSE AS A PROGRAM DIRECTOR- THE THING THAT ALWAYS WORRIES ME MOST WERE THE RESIDENTS WHO THOUGHT THEY KNEW MORE THAN THEY REALLY DD. AND THOSE ARE THE ONES I HAD TO KEEP A CLOSE EYE ON RIGHT- LATE DEL SO SOMETIMES KNOWING JUST ENOUGH IS ACTUALLY MORE DANGEROUS BECAUSE YOU DON'T REALIZE THE LIMITS OF WHAT YOU KNOW OR DON'T KNOW. SO WHAT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT IS WERE RUSHING TO GET THE BUT WE'RE GONNA CREATE THIS PROGRAM THAT DOESN'T EXIST RIGHT SO WE CAN VENT THIS BEHAVIORAL HEALTH COACH OR WHATEVER. AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO DO WHAT AND I AGAIN I'M INTERESTED IN THE QUESTION AS TO HOW MUCH TRAINING TO GO TO HAVE THEIR OWN LICENSED OKAY BUT EXACTLY HOW MUCH TRAINING IS INTENSIFIED THE WORD INTENSIVE. WHAT IS THE DEFINITION OF THAT. AND THEN- I WONDER IN THESE SCHOOLS. RT UNSUPERVISED- IS SOMEONE KEEPING AN EYE ON WHAT THEY'RE DOING IN CASE THEY- YOU OVER EXTEND THEMSELVES. IS THERE SOMEONEIS THERE GOING TO BE A MASTER YOU KNOW SOMEONE WHO ACTUALLY HAS PROFESSIONAL TRAINING IS LICENSE AND ACCOUNTABLE- TERMS OF THEIR- THEIR- YET TO MONITOR HOW MANY OF HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE GONNA BE SUPERVISING YOU KNOW HOW MANY. HOW HOW MANY PROFESSIONALLY LICENSE PROFESSIONALS CAN BE WATCHING OVER THEM SO THAT A PERSON CAN HAVE TWELVE OF THEM KEEP AN EYE ON THE TWO GOT IT FOR OR HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE. SO SO I APPRECIATE THE GENERAL IDEA YOU TRY OKAY HOW CAN WE TRY TO RUSH THIS WORK FORCE BUT I ALSO WANT BE VERY CAUTIOUS ABOUT WHAT WE'RE TELLING PEOPLE THEY'RE ACTUALLY GETTING. AND I DID AND I DID BY THE WAY I DO AGREE THAT WHAT WE SHOULD BE THINKING ABOUT HOW WE BUILD A CAREER LADDER SO I'M NOT SAYING THAT YOU CAN'T HAVE PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING UP THE CAREER LADDER IN TRYING TO GET THEM AND OPPORTUNITY. AND ALSO BE ABLE TO UTILIZE WHAT THEY HAVE LEARNED TO BE ABLE HELP DELIVER SOME SERVICES. BUT ONLY VERY CAREFUL ABOUT. YOU KNOW A- WHAT. KIND OF EXPECTATIONS WERE SETTING ON THE PEOPLE RECEIVING THOSE SERVICES AND WHAT THESE PEOPLE CAN DO. NOT ONLY THE STUDENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES BUT ALSO EVEN THE TEACHERS AND OTHER STAFF IN THE SCHOOL. BUT WHAT THEY CAN DO. BECAUSE I KNOW WHEN YOU'RE SHORT YOU KNOW YOU JUST DESPERATELY BY THE WAY FUND THAT BACK IN THE GREAT RECESSION- I HAD. YOU KNOW I. AS YET AS SOMEONE WHO TAKES YOUR LIFE CHILDREN WHO HAD LEARNING DISABILITIES BEHAVIORAL ISSUES. I HAD PARENTS BECAUSE THEY HAD TO MENTAL HEALTH CUTS. WHEN WE WERE CUTTING STATE SERVICES BACK IN DOUBT. THAT BACK IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT TWO THOUSAND AND NINE. ASKING WHAT I COULD DO THERAPY FOR THEM AND I SAID WELL YOU KNOW I'M A FULLY TRAINED PHYSICIAN BUT I'M NOT A PSYCHOLOGIST I CAN'T. THEY DON'T DO I CAN'T DO THERAPY I'M NOT TRAINED TO DO THAT. AND SO WILL THIS PERSON KNOW ENOUGH TO SAY NO I CAN'T DO THAT FOR YOU. I DON'T KNOW. I'M NOT SKILLED ENOUGH. SO SO CAN YOU PLEASE HELP ANSWERED THAT HELP ME UNDERSTAND. WHAT'S INTENSIVE TRAINING MEAN. WHO'S SUPERVISING WHAT KIND OF STANDARDS ARE WE PUTTING ON THESE EAR HEALTH COACHES AND COUNSELORS. SO- WAIT WAIT COACH IS- I THINK WHAT I MEAN SO WHEN USING THE TERM INTENSIVE- THESE ATTENTION YOUR INVISION TO BE FULL TIME. TWELVE TO SIXTEEN TO TWENTY FOUR WEEKS OF FORTY HOURS OR FORTY HOURS A WEEK AT TRAINING AND TWENTY- ATTORNEYS ARE NOT PEOPLE WHO WILL NOT BE SUPERVISED THE- THEIR TRAINING. IS SIMPLY TO GET THEM INTO A PLACE WHERE THEY CAN BEACH SUPERVISED FOR UP TO TWO YEARS BY A LICENSED PROFESSIONAL- KIND OF LIKE A AND ON THE JOB I DON'T SEE IT ON THE JOB IN SOCIAL WORK WE DO THAT WE HAVE TO GET OUR FIVE THOUSAND HOURS. SO AGAIN AT THE IDEA IS TO HAVE SOME CLASSROOMS SO TO SPEAK INTENSIVE TRAINING BUT THEN TO REALLY- WORK WITH A MORE PROFESSIONAL STAFF STAFF THAT LEADS THAT THEY COULD REFER CLIENTS TO A PART OF A LOT OF THAT TRAINING IS EXACTLY WHAT YOU JUST MENTIONED. AND THEY'RE IDENTIFYING SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS AND THEY'RE RECOGNIZING- WHEN THEY SHOULD WORK FOR THE YOUNG PERSON TO A PROFESSIONAL AND SO IT REALLY IS- GETTING BACK TO THAT ORIGINAL CONCEPT WE TALKED OF AT THE BEGINNING OF THE HEARING WHICH IS. IN POWER IN MORE THAN ABILITY TO IDENTIFY AND WORK FOR AN OPENING THAT DOOR SO THAT. MORE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO HAVE AN ABILITY TO HAVE A WARM HAND OFF TO THE CARE THAT THEY NEED SO IF IT WAS THAT FOR TRADE THAT THE COACHES THEMSELVES WOULD BE DELIVERING A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF CARE THAT WAS CLINICALLY BASED I DO APOLOGIZE FOR THAT THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY WHAT WE DO. BEST THESE COACHES OKAY CLARIFIED AND- SO I'M JUST TRYING MANAGING THE SEQUENCE OF EVENTS A YEAR IN SCHOOL YOUR CHILD APPEARS TO HAVE SOME BEHAVIORAL ISSUES NOT DOING WELL IN SCHOOL. PERHAPS NOW ACTING OUT SOMEWHAT. THERE'S THIS BEHAVIOR HOW COACH IN THIS SO. OUR DAY IN THE- WATCHING. ARE TEACH. THEN HAVE TO REFER TO THEM PRINCIPLES- AND THEN AND THEN WHO'S AND THEN THE SUPERVISION IS THAT IN PERSON SUPERVISION AT THE SCHOOL SO WE'RE GONNA BE SURE WE HAVE A LICENSED HEALTH FOR. A MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONAL TO SCHOOL SO HE JUST I JUST I GET BETTER MORE CONCRETE HE'S IDEA ABOUT EXACTLY WHERE THESE COACHES SIT AND HOW THEY GET THERE HOW DID HE GET THE PEOPLE IN FRONT OF THEM AND THEN. AND OF COURSE THEN DAY HOPEFULLY THEY'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT MAKE A REFERRAL TO A LICENSE PROFESSIONAL BUT- HOUSE AT SEQUENT EVENT SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN OKAY AND LET ME- BEFORE YOU TRY TO ANSWER THAT MUST MISS WORK BECAUSE THAT BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW OR BUTTONS RIGHT I DON'T KNOW THAT ANYBODY CAN REALLY ANSWER THAT RIGHT NOW I THINK YOU ARE STILL IN A- CONCEPTUAL PHASE AS AS I UNDERSTAND IT. AND SO I THINK WHAT YOU SHOULD TAKE FROM THIS IS THAT THERE ARE SOME CONCERNS- I WILL ALSO SAY THAT AS A PEOPLE I STARTED OFF BEFORE I WAS LICENSED- AND I WORKED IN THE SUBSIDIES PROGRAM I WORKED IN A THERAPEUTIC LONG TERM SUBSIDIES PROGRAM. THE FIRST TIME I EVER HEARD THE WORD THAT SOCIAL WORKER A CAME WITHIN AN M. F. IN FRONT OF IT- PARA PROFESSIONAL WAS ASKING ME ABOUT WHAT I WAS BECAUSE HE THOUGHT I WAS BEING TOO KIND- SO I KNOW THAT THE PEOPLE COME IN ALL KINDS OF. OF FLAVORS OF- OF- EXPERIENCE AND SOMETIMES THOSE WITH DIRECT EXPERIENCES ARE VERY HELPFUL BUT I ALSO THINK IT'S ALWAYS GOOD TO HAVE A REAL A BLAND AND MAKE SURE AGAIN THE ISSUE OF SUPERVISION. I THINK IT IS IMPERATIVE I KNOW IN CLASSROOMS OF A TEACHER CAN HAVE A PARA PROFESSIONAL THAT IS FANTASTIC AND I KNOW THEY ARE OFTEN NOT A DEGREE PEOPLE BUT CERTIFIED AND TAKEN SOME CLASSES. SO I UNDERSTAND THE MODEL I THINK THAT YOU I THINK WE ALL UNDERSTAND THAT MODEL BUT I THINK THERE'S GOING TO BE A LOT OF QUESTIONS GOING FORWARD ABOUT ABOUT SUPERVISION AND WHO THESE FOLKS ARE AND WHAT THEIR TRAINING IS. AND ALL OF THAT BUT I THINK WE ALL UNDERSTAND. THE NEED FOR A CAREER LADDER AND WE ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT EVERYBODY IS NOT GOING TO BE A DEGREED PROFESSIONAL- BUT. THAT THERE WILL BE A CHECKS AND BALANCES IS SUPERVISION. BUILT INTO THIS. AND THAT WHAT I'M UNDER. YES THAT IS OUR GOAL AND AGAIN WHY WE- REALLY WANT TO HAVE THAT PLANNING HERE TO WORK WITH OUR PARTNERS. AND TO DESIGN SOMETHING THAT IS GOING TO. HAVE THEIR EXPERTISE OBVIOUSLY BUT AGAIN HOPEFULLY HELP US IN THE IN THE LONG TERM CAPACITY YOU HAVE AS A GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO CAN COME IN- AND MAYBE BE A COACH FOR BURKE WHAT AS LONG AS THEY WANT OR POTENTIALLY CONTINUE ON WITH THEIR EDUCATION. AND THEIR SKILL SETS SO I THINK WE'RE EXCITED ABOUT IT BEING A NEW OPPORTUNITY TO. I HAVE A DIFFERENT CHAD. EXPANDING CAPACITY IN PARTICULAR AGAIN OUR HOPE IS THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO RECRUIT PEOPLE WHO MAY NOT HAVE BEEN INTERESTED IN GOING INTO THIS FIELD AND OR- REALLY WANT TO GET BACK TO THEIR COMMUNITIES IN A MEANINGFUL WAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SO I GUESS THE END AGAIN- DO APPRECIATE YOU GETTING BACK TO ME WITH THE ANSWERS TO SOME OF THOSE THOUGHTS A FORGET REALIZE YOU'RE STILL BOMBING BUT THAT ALSO MEANS. WHAT IS THE INFRASTRUCTURE FOR ALL THE SUPERVISORS TO RIGHT- SO YOU KNOW WE'RE GONNA HAVE THESE COACHES WE HAVE THIS. BUDGET LINE FOR COACHES STAND FOR THE SUPERVISORS COME FROM BECAUSE- THIS IS WHAT WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH SCHOOL NURSES FOR ALL THE SCHOOLS. WE CERTAINLY DON'T HAVE ENOUGH LICENSED MENTAL HEALTH WORKERS IN SCHOOLS AS WELL SO WE'RE GOING TO CREATE THESE COACHES IN THE SCHOOLS AND THERE CAN BE SUPERVISED AND WE NEED TO KNOW WHO THE SUPERVISORS ARE WHERE WE CAN SUPERVISORS. I'LL JUST MAKE ONE OTHER LAST COMMENT AS WELL- AND THIS GOES BACK TO- SO. AGAIN THIS BEHAVIOR HEALTH TRAINING FOR PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS WHICH AGAIN I AGREE WITH- AND THAT WE SHOULD ENCOURAGE A PRIMARY CARE US- STAFF INCLUDING PHYSICIANS. FOR MODERATE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CONDITIONS BUT I'LL TELL YOU TO SOMEONE WHO ACTUALLY DOES THAT WORK DID THAT WORK CLINICALLY- THE TO THE ONE OF THE CHALLENGES IS OF YOU KNOW THAT. IS NOT SO MUCH I MEAN JUST PART OF IT'S THE TRAINING PART BUT ACTUALLY THE REAL CHALLENGE IS THIS I THAT AND- AND AGAIN THIS PERHAPS MORE QUESTION FOR DH YES ACTUALLY IN THE LONG RUN THEN YOU. BUT SINCE YOU'RE DOING THIS PART THE WORKFORCE PIECES THAT- AS A PRIMARY CARE DOCTOR I DIDN'T GET REIMBURSED FOR. THE TIME IT TOOK TO DO THE MENTAL HEALTH WORK. SO ON ONE HAND WELL I WOULD TRY TO DO SOME OF THE MENTAL HEALTH WORKERS SOMEONE AGAIN FIFTY S. FELLOWSHIP TRAINED B. L. BEHAVIORAL DEVELOPMENTAL PEDIATRICIAN- THAT- THE- THE BILLING MANAGERS WOULD GO WAIT A MINUTE YU'RE DOING ALL THIS WORK THAT. CAN'T BE BILLED FOR IN YOUR. SPENDING TIME. THAT IS THAT AGAIN. IS NOT SOMETHING WE KNOW BILLS. AND SO MAYBE YOU SHOULD STOP DOING THAT AND JUST. REFERRED THOSE PEOPLE INSTEAD OF TWENTY- AND SO I THINK YOU KNOW AGAIN JUST GOES TO THE DISCONNECT BETWEEN SOMEONE BEING TRAINED FOR SOMETHING AND THE SYSTEMS THAT. SUPPORTER DON'T SUPPORT THOSE TYPE OF ACTIVITIES. AND SO AGAIN I REALIZE THIS PERHAPS OUTSIDE YOUR DEPARTMENT BUT BEGAN AS WE'RE BUILDING THIS WORKFORCE PIPELINES WE NEED TO BE SURE THAT. THEY CAN GO INTO POSITIONS. AND THE POSITIONS THEMSELVES SUPPORT THE TYPE OF ACTIVITIES ARE TRYING TO TRAIN THEM FOR. OTHERWISE YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE- THE GROUP WILL GIVE PEOPLE THROUGH PIPELINES SHOULD. WE FIND OUT ARE DOING THE THINGS WE HOPING THEY WOULD DO BECAUSE THE OTHER- POSITIONS DON'T ACTUALLY ALLOW THEM TO. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OKAY. LET'S MOVE ON TO OUR MISCELLANEOUS TECHNICAL ADJUSTMENTS FROM THE LAST ONE HERE. THOROUGHLY MADAM CHAIR SO WE HAVE TO TECHNICAL ISSUES THE FIRST IS THE WITHDRAWAL OF THE PROPOSED LOAN FROM THE HOSPITAL BUILDING FUND TO THE GENERAL FUND IN THE AMOUNT OF FORTY MILLION DOLLARS WHICH WOULD BE REPAID. AND THE NEXT IS THE MEDICALLY UNDERSERVED ACCOUNT FOR PHYSICIANS- THE AGE HAVE EXTENSION FOR THE ENCUMBRANCE LIQUIDATION PERIOD TO GIVE US MORE TIME TO LIQUIDATE THE GRANT AGREEMENTS THAT SUPPORT THE STEVEN M. THOMSON POSITION CORPS LOAN REPAYMENT PROGRAM. THANK YOU DEPARTMENT FINANCE ANYTHING. THANK YOU COMMENT OKAY I DO NOT HEAR HAND UP MISS SHE DOES ON OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH DESERVED COURSE OKAY. THAT ONE THANK YOU NO. OKAY THANK YOU VERY AND NOW WE ARE TO MOVE ON AND I MISTER EWING THERE DIRECTOR YOU MENTAL SERVICES OVERSIGHT ACCOUNTABILITY- COMMISSION COMPARED AFTERNOON. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR THE CHANCE TO JOIN YOU TODAY TOBY DOING WITH THE MENTAL HEALTH COMMISSION- PRESENTING ON THE AUGMENTED FUNDING PROPOSAL FOR THE MEDICAL STUDENT SERVICES ACT THE- YOU RECALL AND AS OUTLINED AS AN AS IS OUTLINED IN THE ANALYSIS AND THE AGENDA FOR TODAY SENATE SUPPORTED THE MENTAL HEALTH STUDENT SERVICES ACT COUPLE OF YEARS AGO THE COMMISSION HAS BEEN ABLE TO PROVIDE. SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN GRANTS TO EIGHTEEN COUNTY SCHOOL PARTNERSHIPS TO SUPPORT THE DEVELOPMENT OF SCHOOL BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. PROGRAMS IN THOSE COMMUNITIES- THESE WERE SMALL INVESTMENTS RELATIVE TO THE SCALE OF NEED BUT VERY IMPORTANT INVESTMENTS. AND WE WERE UNABLE TO FIND TWENTY APPLICATIONS THAT CAME IN AT THAT TIME. WE SEE THESE PROPOSALS AS WELL I USE THE TERM THAT SENATOR PAN REFERRED TO S. CLINIC READY OR PERHAPS STUDENT READY OPPORTUNITIES TO SUPPORT STUDENTS AT AS THEY BEGIN TO RETURN TO SCHOOL IN THE FALL. OUT PART OF OUR- EMPHASIS ON THIS PROGRAM IS WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH COUNTIES OVER THE PAST COUPLE OF WEEKS AND WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH COUNTIES TO PRE POSITION SO TO SPEAK OPPORTUNITIES TO GET THESE FUNDS OUT TO COUNTIES. AS SOON AS JULY ONE- WE CAN ACCOMMODATE THAT SCHEDULE DOES THIS REALLY MEAN THE COUNTY'S CANADA DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN THAT HAVING THESE CONTRACTS AND FUNDING IN PLACE WILL ALLOW THEM TO HAVE SERVICES AVAILABLE WHEN SCHOOLS REOPEN IN THE FALL BUT THAT IS OUR INTENTION. TO BE AS A STUDENT READY AS WE CAN BE AND AS OUR SCHOOL COUNTY PARTNERSHIPS CAN BE. THAT THE MAY REVISE PROPOSES TO INCREASE THE AUGMENTATION THAT JANUARY BUDGET INCLUDES TWENTY FIVE MILLION AN ADDITIONAL TWENTY FIVE MILLION THAT WOULD ALLOW US TO MOVE FROM EIGHTEEN SCHOOL COUNTY PARTNERSHIPS CURRENTLY. TO SUPPORT AN ADDITIONAL TWELVE. AND AB SOME FUNDING AVAILABLE TO SUPPORT ASSESSMENT AND EVALUATION OF THE PROPOSAL AS IT MOVES FORWARD. CITED ABOUT THIS WORK THERE'S TREMENDOUS DEMAND ON THE PART OF COUNTIES AND SCHOOLS AND AS YOU'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THE PAST COUPLE OF HOURS TREMENDOUS NEED TO SUPPORT STUDENTS IN THE ENVIRONMENTS WHERE THERE OFTEN MOST COMFORTABLE WHERE THERE'S OFTEN THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF TRUST OF PUBLIC AGENCIES WHICH IS COOL. AND SO WE SEE THIS AS AN ESSENTIAL STRATEGY TO BE VERY RESPONSIVE TO THE NEEDS THAT WE HAVE TODAY AND- AND OVER THE COURSE OF THE NEXT FEW YEARS AS STUDENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES RETURN TO ABOUT THE RE OPENING OF OUR COMMUNITIES. BUT MORE SPECIFICALLY RE OPENING OF SCHOOLS HAVE STRATEGY TO SUPPORT THE STUDENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES AB UNANSWERED QUESTIONS YOU HAVE. ABOUT THIS PROPOSAL THANK YOU OKAY M. BERMAN OF FINANCE AND SEE YOUR HAND UP ON SEARS UP EITHER MR- JUST BROKE QUESTIONS EWING AT HOW MANY ADDITIONALLY FUNDED GRANT UNCONFIRMED GRANTS CAN WE FUND WITH A- COMBINED FIFTY MILLION. WELCOME TO. COME FULLY FIND ALL OF THE UNFUNDED APPLICATIONS IT'S A LITTLE OVER EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS. THAT WOULD STILL LEAVE TWENTY COUNTIES WHICH ARE PRIMARILY SMALL RURAL COUNTIES THAT DIDN'T APPLY. THEY DIDN'T APPLY FOR A RANGE OF REASONS IN OUR OUT REACH TO THEM IN SOME INSTANCES THEY WERE IN THE MIDDLE OF PREPARING FOR KOBE. AND THEY JUST DIDN'T HAVE THE TIME TO GO TO THE GRANT APPLICATION PROCESS- SOME OF THEM FELT THAT THE SCALE OF FUNDING WOULD NOT OF BEEN SUFFICIENT. RELATIVE TO THE WORK THAT IT WOULD TAKE- BAD WE'VE CALCULATED THAT TO FULLY FUND ALL OF THE APPLICANTS THAT WE HAVE WOULD BE SLIGHTLY OVER EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS. SO WHY NOT ASK FOR THAT. WELL WE WOULD CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO FULLY FIND NOT JUST THOSE EIGHTY. BUT ALL COUNTIES. ALL COUNTY PARTNERSHIPS WHICH WE COULD DO VERY QUICKLY IF WE DIDN'T HAVE TO DO IF YOUR COMPETITIVE PROCUREMENT PROCESS- WE FEEL LIKE THAT THAT THE NEED IS THERE AND WE HAVE THE RESOURCES TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN VERY QUICKLY- THAT'S NOT WHERE THIS CONVERSATION WITH ADMINISTRATION LANDED. BUT WE'RE HAPPY TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION MOVING FORWARD. OKAY IT JUST MAKES SENSE AS WE KEEP TALKING ABOUT THE IMMEDIACY THAT WERE ABLE TO FIND AS MANY OF THESE AS WE POSSIBLY CAN. ADD A BIT THREE COUNTIES I REPRESENT THE ONE BUT- NEITHER TWO OF THEM DID NOT- AND THE OTHER ONE I JUST HAVE A TEENY SLIVER OF THAT COUNTY. AND PARTLY IT'S BECAUSE THEY'RE- THEY'RE THE COUNTIES WITH LESS CAPACITY SOMETIMES WITH WHAT WAS STAFF AND RESOURCES. AND SO I WOULD ALSO AGREED THAT COMPETITIVE GRANT CAN MAKE IT- PERHAPS LESS. BUT LESS LIKELY FOR SOMEBODY TO JUMP IN I'M WONDERING IF WE CAN DO SOME KIND OF TIERED SYSTEM MICHAEL WE HAVE SOME EXTRA CASH WE CAN. FUND A BUNCH MORE UNDERSTANDING AT SOME POINT DOWN THE ROAD- THEY'LL HAVE TO BE. A MATCH BUT PAN. THE LATEST PHYSICAL IF WE WERE GOING TO FIND ALL THE COUNTIES- OBVIOUSLY HAVE TO PRODUCE A PROPOSAL OF SUFFICIENT QUALITY FOR YOU- HOW MUCH SO YOU SAID EIGHTY FOR IF WE FUNDED EVERYTHING BUT THEN HOW MUCH FOR. ALL THE COUNTIES. ABOUT A HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS OKAY. AT AT THE SCALE. THAT WE HAD OFFERED OUT. IN THE INITIAL GRANT JUST TWO AND A HALF MILLION FOR SMALL COUNTIES FOR. FOR MEDIUM SIZED COUNTIES AND SIX FOR LARGE COUNTIES THAT RECOGNIZES THAT FOR COUNTY LIKE LOS ANGELES SIX MILLION DOLLARS IS INSUFFICIENT. BUT IT IS A ESTAR WHAT WHAT WE WORK BUT WHEN WE DESIGNED THIS PROGRAM OF COURSE WE WERE NOT STRUGGLING WITH KOBE. OUR INTENT HERE WAS TO INCENTIVIZE THE ESTABLISHMENT OF ROBUST PARTNERSHIPS BETWEEN. OUR COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SYSTEMS AND OUR LOCAL EDUCATION AGENCIES AND SO WE REALLY WERE CREATING WHAT WE REFER TO AS INCENTIVE GRANTS. TO BRING THEM TO THE TABLE- THAT'S REALLY NOT A PROBLEM ANYMORE BECAUSE THEY'RE RECOGNIZING HOW THEY NEED TO BE WORKING TOGETHER- BUT IT BUT WE- STILL NEED TO RESOURCE THEM BECAUSE THERE ARE NOT NECESSARILY AS YOU'VE HEARD THROUGHOUT THE COURSE OF TODAY. WITH THE GOVERNOR'S PRIVATE HERE HEALTH INITIATIVE. THERE ARE NOT ADEQUATE RESOURCES THE STAFFING THE PROGRAMMING THE TREE THE- THE- FUNDING TO SUPPORT TRAINING. AND SCREENING FOR STUDENTS AND SO- YOU KNOW THE NEED IS IMMENSE AS RECOGNIZE EVIDENCED BY THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. IT JUST REMIND ME- SO THIS- THIS IS FOR HOW MANY YEARS THE HOW MANY% YEARS OF FUNDING ASSISTANCE FOR ONE YEAR OR- THESE SO. NOW THESE GRANTS ACTUALLY AVAILABLE OVER MULTIPLE YEARS WE WORK WITH OUR LOCAL PARTNERS. TO DETERMINE HOW MUCH TIME THEY HAVE TO SPEND THE MONEY IT'S TYPICALLY THREE YEARS OKAY AND REYES FOUR OR FIVE OKAY- WE CANNOT GIVE THEM MORE MORE DOLLARS IN LAST YOU PROVIDE MORE DOLLARS BUT WE CAN GIVE THEM MORE TIME. AND COUNTIES HAVE THE CAPACITY TO REALLY TAILOR THEIR PROPOSAL TO THEIR NEEDS SO MANY COUNTIES ARE REALLY HIGHLIGHTING SCREENING. FOR STUDENTS. AND THAT ALL OF THE CHALLENGES. BUT ALSO THE OPPORTUNITY SAID THAT PRESENTS THAT YOU DISCUSSED TODAY. SO ROUGHLY ON USUALLY AROUND THREE YEARS HE SAID. EIGHTY MILLION IF. ALL OR SO CALLED THE YOU KNOW. CLINIC REYES HERE STUDENT RIGHT AND THEN UNDER TWENTY FIVE MILLION TO FUND ALL THE COUNTY OKAY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. PLEASE TELL US YOUR HAND UP. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- WE WOULD NOTE THAT THE FUND THIRTY EIGHTY FIVE HAS NOT BEEN RECONCILED EFFORTS TIME AND GIVEN THE CHALLENGE OF MULTIPLE DEPARTMENTS SPENDING OUT OF IT AS WELL AS MANY EXISTING OBLIGATIONS ON BOTH FROM THE ADMINISTRATION AS WELL AS LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES WE BELIEVE THAT AT THIS TIME ABSENT THE PLAN BE RECONCILED THE CURRENT LEVEL OF RESOURCES AND FISCALLY PRUDENT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISS PATEL. OKAY LET'S MOVE ON TO- THE NEXT ISSUE WHICH IS- CALIFORNIA HEALTH BENEFIT EXCHANGE COVERED CALIFORNIA. I SEE MISTER BROTHER GOOD AFTERNOON GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS K&lt;c.cyan&gt; RAVAL DIRECTOR&lt;/c&gt; POLICY ELIGIBILITY IN RESEARCH COVER CALIFORNIA AND HAPPY TO BE WITH YOU THIS AFTERNOON TO ADDRESS CURRENT CALIFORNIA'S BUDGET ISSUES- BEGIN WITH ISSUE ONE BY PROVIDING AN OVERVIEW OF THE ADVANCE PREMIUM ASSISTANCE SUBSIDY PROGRAM ADOPTION. THE AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN INCLUDED SEVERAL PROVISIONS TO MAKE COVERAGE THE EXCHANGES MORE AFFORDABLE FOR PLAN YEARS TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWENTY TWO WHICH ARE WELL SUMMARIZED IN THE HEARING AGENDA TODAY- SPECIFICALLY. IT INCREASED FEDERAL PREMIUM SUBSIDIES SUPPORT FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH INCOME BELOW 4100% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL INCLUDING ELIMINATING PREMIUMS CONTRIBUTIONS FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH INCOME BELOW 150% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL. I ALSO ELIMINATED THE CAP ON FEDERAL SUBSIDIES FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH INCOME ABOVE 4100% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL. SO THAT NO ELIGIBLE INDIVIDUAL HAS TO PAY MORE THAN EIGHT POINT 5% OF THEIR INCOME. IN PREMIUMS FOR BENCHMARK PLAN. AS YOUR AGENDA NOTES THE PREMIUM SUBSIDIES UNDER THE AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN ARE MORE GENEROUS THAN THE STATE PREMIUM SUBSIDIES WHICH EFFECTIVELY ZEROS OUT THE CONSUMER STATE PREMIUM SUBSIDY. COVER CALIFORNIA IMPLEMENTED THE AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN PREMIUM SUBSIDY ENHANCEMENTS FOR COVERAGE BEGINNING MAY FIRST OF THIS YEAR. AFTER NEW AND EXISTING MEMBERS. FOR THIS REASON THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE STATE PREMIUMS THAT SEEKS BENCHERS WILL BE LIMITED TO THE PERIOD JANUARY THROUGH APRIL AND FOR COVERAGE FROM THE FIRST OF THIS YEAR THROUGH THE TWENTY TWENTY TWO CONSUMERS WILL RECEIVE ONLY FEDERAL PREMIUM SUBSIDIES THROUGH THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT IN AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN. THE MAY REVISION REFLECTS A REDUCTION OF GENERAL FUND EXPENDITURES FORTY FOR BOTH CURRENT AND BUDGET YEAR TO REFLECT THIS YEAR OWING OUT OF THE STATE PREMIUM SUBSIDY TO THE AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN. THAT CONCLUDES MY BRIEF OVERVIEW BUT I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU HAVE AND THEN I WOULD TURN IT TO MY DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE COLLEAGUES TO ADDRESS A QUESTION TO. THE SIDE OF. OKAY WHEN WE GO AHEAD AND HAVE FINANCE ADDRESS QUESTION TO THAT. THANK YOU IN SHEFFIELD APARTMENT OF FINANCE. THE QUESTION TO- THE STATE SUBSIDY PROGRAM WAS ESTABLISHED AS A TEMPORARY THREE YEAR PROGRAM IN PART TO PROVIDE A BRIDGE UNTIL POSSIBLE FEDERAL ACTION INCREASING HEALTH CARE AFFORDABILITY WE APPLAUD THE BOLD ACTIONS OF THE FEDERAL AND BY NOON MINISTRATION WHICH HAVE HELPED EXPAND AFFORDABILITY FOR MANY CALIFORNIANS. THE SIGNIFICANT EXPANSION BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IN THE AREA OF HEALTH CARE PREMIUM ASSISTANCE DOES NOT CHANGE THE ADMINISTRATION'S COMMITMENT TO HEALTH CARE AFFORDABILITY. AND DOES NOT PRECLUDE US FROM EXPLORING OTHER AFFORDABILITY OPTIONS IN FUTURE BUDGETS WHICH MAY HAVE COST GREATER THAN THEY WERE YOUR FUNDS I'M OUT. BY SETTING ASIDE THE PENALTY REVENUE WE ARE MAINTAINING THE COMMITMENT TO USE A PENALTY REVENUE TO INCREASE AFFORDABILITY MEASURES. WE ARE OPEN TO IDEAS FROM THE LEGISLATURE REGARDING FUTURE INVESTMENTS IN THIS AREA INCLUDING USING. USE OF GENERAL FUND BEYOND THE AMOUNT SET ASIDE IN THE PROPOSED RESERVE FUND. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OKAY. THAT WOULD BE. HELLO MANY THANKS JOHNSON OKAY NO HAND UP OKAY OF THE FENCE. YEAH BUT THANKS VERY MUCH I APPRECIATE THE ADMINISTRATION'S OPENNESS TO LOOK AT- YOU YOU- FOR DIVISIONAL- HEALTH COVERAGE AFFORDABILITY OPTIONS I WOULD ALSO MAKE NOTE THAT THAT I CERTAINLY FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE IF I KNEW THAT THE- BUDGET THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WOULD BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE SUBSIDIES WHICH WE'RE CERTAINLY VERY HAPPY TO SEE AN- BUT NO CALIFORNIA LEADING AND STARTING THIS- AND THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT NOW HELP ANNOUNCE AND- PROVIDING THESE ALTERNATIVE SUBSIDIES- BUT I'D- I HOPE THAT ALSO IS WE'RE LOOKING AT HOW YEARS THAT IN CASE. UNFORTUNATELY IF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DOESN'T SUSTAIN THIS THAT WE ARE GOING TO PLAN TO BE ABLE TO RESUME THESE SUBSIDIES- IF FOR SOME REASON THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S NOT ABLE TO CONTINUE THEIR PLAN- SO THAT WE DON'T CREATE A- SUDDEN SHIFT FOR PEOPLE INCOME CALIFORNIA THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OKAY AT ISSUE NUMBER TWO ONE DOLLAR PREMIUM SUBSIDY PROGRAM. OKAY EXCELLENT UNDER THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT FEDERAL PREMIUM TAX CREDITS CANNOT BE USED ON THE PREMIUM AMOUNT FOR CERTAIN ABORTION SERVICES THE FORMAL CARE ACT ALSO REQUIRES A QUALIFIED HEALTH PLANS OFFERED THROUGH MARKETPLACES LIKE COVER CALIFORNIA MUST SEPARATELY ESTIMATE THE PREMIUM COST OF THESE ABORTION SERVICES AND THOSE COSTS COULD NOT BE LESS THAN ONE DOLLAR PER MEMBER PER MONTH. FOR THIS REASON MANY COVER CALIFORNIA ENROLLEES HAD. HAD TO PAY A ONE DOLLAR MONTHLY PREMIUM EVEN THOUGH THE PREMIUM TAX CREDITS AVAILABLE TO THEM I WOULD OTHERWISE COVER THEIR ENTIRE PREMIUM COSTS. AS I MENTIONED IN THE LAST ISSUE THE AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN ELIMINATES PREMIUM CONTRIBUTIONS FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH INCOME BELOW LEVEL. AND SO THIS MEANS THAT MORE AT COVERED CALIFORNIA ENROLLEES THAN EVER COULD HAVE ACCESS TO ZERO PREMIUM PLAN BUT FOR THE ONE DOLLAR MONTHLY. CHARGE THAT'S REQUIRED FOR ABORTION SERVICES. RECENT RESEARCH ON MARKET PLACE ENROLLMENT SUGGESTS THAT THERE'S A SO CALLED ZERO PRICE EFFECT WHERE ENROLLMENT SPIKES IN MARKET PLACES ARE THAT HAVE PREMIUMS THAT ARE FREE AS OPPOSED TO JUST VERY LOW COST. SO THIS PROPOSAL BUILDS ON THAT RESEARCH AND WOULD ALLOW COVER CALIFORNIA TO OFFER TRUE ZERO PREMIUM PLANS. ARE SPECIFICALLY UNDER THIS BUDGET ITEM COVER CALIFORNIA'S REQUESTING AUTHORITY TO ESTABLISH A PERMANENT PROGRAM TO PAY THE ONE DOLLAR PER MEMBER PER MONTH CHARGE FOR ABORTION SERVICES FOR WHICH FEDERAL FUNDING IS PROHIBITED. AND WE'RE ALSO REQUESTING EXPENDITURES STORY OF APPROXIMATELY TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS. FOR THE PROGRAM FOR BUDGET YEAR TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. WE BELIEVE THIS PROPOSAL WOULD BE AN IMPORTANT PROGRAM ENHANCEMENT. TO INCREASE COVERAGE FOR LOW INCOME INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE ELIGIBLE FOR THE PROGRAM TODAY. WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT WHEN PAIRED WITH COVER CALIFORNIA'S UPCOMING IMPLEMENTATION OF AUTO ENROLMENT OF INDIVIDUALS LOSING MEDICAID COVERAGE. OF THIS POLICY COULD BE A POWERFUL TOOL FOR MANY IN SMOOTHING THE TRANSITION FROM MEDICAID TO COVER CALIFORNIA. IF APPROVED COVER CALIFORNIA WOULD PAY THE ONE DOLLAR PER MEMBER PER MONTH PREMIUM CHARGE BEGINNING FOR THE COVERAGE YEAR TWENTY TWENTY TWO. THAT CONCLUDES MY PRESENTATION ON THIS ISSUE AND I'LL BE HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- DEPARTMENT FINANCE. THE THING THAT I THINK YOU KNOW HELLO NOTHING ON THIS ONE- WE JUST QUICKLY NOTE THAT WE DO NOT HAVE CONCERNS WITH THE PROPOSAL AND TO BELIEVE IT COULD BE A COST EFFECTIVE APPROACH TO IMPROVE IMPROVING COVERAGE WITHIN THE- EXCHANGE THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I THINK WE WOULD CONCUR HERE SO THANK YOU- AND THEN. THE FINAL ISSUE IN HERE IS HEALTH CARE AFFORDABILITY RESERVE FUND. GREAT AS WE DISCUSSED EARLIER THE AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED INVESTMENT IN FEDERAL PREMIUM SUPPORT. THROUGH MARKETPLACES. AND WHILE THAT ENHANCE AND EXPAND THE PREMIUM SUPPORT IS TEMPORARY PRESIDENT BIDEN'S AMERICAN FAMILIES PLAN PROPOSAL WOULD MAKE A SUBSIDIES PERMANENT- CALIFORNIA IS PROUD TO PARTNER WITH THE ADMINISTRATION IN THE LEGISLATURE TO IMPLEMENT OUR STATE SUBSIDY PROGRAM WHICH WE BELIEVE WAS A SUCCESSFUL PROOF OF CONCEPT. THE EXPANSION OF SUBSIDIES TO MIDDLE INCOME CONSUMERS WHICH WE NOW SEE IN THE AMERICAN RESCUE PLANS. THAT WE'RE ALSO EXCITED FOR THE POTENTIAL COVERAGE AND AFFORDABILITY IMPACT OF THE ZERO PREMIUM PLAN PROPOSAL AND AS WE SHOULDN'T PRIOR DISCUSSIONS WITH THE SUBCOMMITTEE COVER CALIFORNIA IS COMMITTED TO MAXIMIZING THE BENEFITS OF THE AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN FOR CALIFORNIA. WE WORKED QUICKLY TO IMPLEMENT THE NEW SUBSIDIES AND WE'RE OFFERING A SPECIAL ENROLLMENT THROUGH THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE ELIMINATE ANY BARRIERS CALIFORNIANS ENROLLING IN TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THOSE SUBSIDIES- WERE ALSO EMPHASIZING EARLY SIGN UPS UNDER THE ACT BY INVESTING UP TO THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS. IN MARKETING IN OUTREACH EFFORTS AND WILL CONTINUE THAT THROUGH THE REST OF THE YEAR AND DURING OUR TRADITIONAL. OPEN ENROLLMENT PERIOD NOVEMBER. SO AS WE WORKS THE BALLOT OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE TO MAXIMIZING. AND AWAIT THE OUTCOME OF POTENTIAL ADDITIONAL CHANGES AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL WE DO BELIEVE IT'S PRUDENT TO ESTABLISH A RESERVE. THAT COULD BE USED PARTIALLY BACKFILLED THE LOSS OF THE MORE GENEROUS FEDERAL SUBSIDIES IF THEY'RE NOT EXTENDED. OR POTENTIALLY TO SUPPORT OTHER STATE HEALTH CARE AFFORDABILITY INVESTMENTS COULD BE EXPLORED IN THE FUTURE. TO THAT END AND AS WE DISCUSSED BRIEFLY THE MAY REVISION PROPOSES TO ESTABLISH A HEALTH CARE AFFORDABILITY RESERVE FUND. AND PROVIDE A STORY FOR A ONE TIME GENERAL FUND TRANSFER. APPROXIMATELY THREE HUNDRED THIRTY THREE MILLION INTO THE NEW FUND- THE TRANSFER AMOUNT IS EQUAL TO THE PROJECTED REVENUE- FOR THE INDIVIDUAL SHARED RESPONSIBILITY PAYMENT FOR TWENTY TWENTY. TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWENTY TWO. LAST THE TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS TO COVER THE PROPOSED- A ONE DOLLAR PREMIUM SUBSIDY PROGRAM. THE FIRM WOULD BE SUBJECT TO APPROPRIATION BY THE LEGISLATURE- AND WOULD BE USED TO IMPROVE AFFORDABILITY OF HEALTH CARE COVERAGE FOR COVER CALIFORNIAN RELEASED. THAT CONCLUDES MY PRESENTATION ON ISSUE THREE THE HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I DO NOT SEE THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE HAND UP I DO NOT SEE THE ALEJO'S DEPARTMENT WELCOME QUE. UM WELL YOU GOT OFF THE HOOK PRETTY EASY TODAY MISERABLE YEARS HERE'S WHERE. TECHNICAL MOSTLY IN NATURE AND WE APPRECIATE YOUR PRESENTATION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANKS SO MUCH THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AND NOW WE ARE GOING TO MAYBE WE SHOULD TAKE LET'S TAKE A TWO MINUTE RECESS TO GET EVERYBODY SET. BEFORE WE MOVE ON TO THE NEXT PART B. OF OUR HEARING SO WE'LL. TAKE A I COULD THREE MINUTE RECESS. OKAY LET'S START. RECONVENE THIS. COME THIS HEARING AND ON BEFORE I TURN TO DIRECTOR. JOHNSON LET ME SAY THERE WAS ONE TYPE- IN OUR- AGENDA. UNDER ISSUE ONE UNDER DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES- THE BULLET FOR THE CAL WORKS INDIAN HEALTH CLINICS. INCORRECTLY IDENTIFIES A PROPOSED INCREASE OF THREE POINT NINE MILLION. IT IS ONE POINT NINE MILLION NOT THREE POINT NINE MILLION AND WE KNOW TWO MILLION DOLLARS. COUNTS EVEN WE HAVE A SURPLUS OKAY- DIRECTOR JOHNSON A NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN. THEY KNOW EVERYBODY'S NAMES NOW IT'S PROGRESS IS BEING MADE AS WE MOVE FORWARD SO WELCOME- AND A YEAR ON ISSUE NUMBER ONE CALYX. TRAINING THANK YOU MADAM JIM JOHNSON DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES JUST QUICKLY GOING TO HIGHLIGHT SEVERAL PROPOSALS FROM THE GOVERNOR GOVERNOR DESCENDS ONE HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS. CALIFORNIA COME BACK PLAN IN THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO MAY REVISE PROPOSAL WHICH PROPOSES TO MAKE INVESTMENTS IN CALIFORNIA STATE GINEPRI BRANDS THAT HAVE BEEN DESIGNED TO COLLECTIVELY WORK TO DISRUPT POVERTY. BY PROVIDING HOUSING CASH ASSISTANCE STUDENT HEALTH BENEFITS ACCESS TO CHILDCARE AND EARLY LEARNING AND MORE SHE'S A STORE CALLED MULTI GENERATIONAL INVESTMENTS WILL HELP PROVIDE A FOUNDATION TO ADVANCE THE HEALTH AND WELL BEING OF ALL CALIFORNIANS IMPROVED. SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC MOBILITY FOCUSED ON SUPPORTING THOSE WHO NEED IT MOST WHAT SPECIFICALLY WERE PROPOSING TO CONFRONT HOMELESSNESS AT HISTORIC LEVELS INCLUDING STRENGTHENING THE INTEGRATION OF HOUSING AND SOCIAL SERVICES. PROVIDE GREATER SUPPORTS FOR ADULTS OUR ELDERS AND THOSE WITH DISABILITIES AGAIN SEEKING TO ACHIEVE FUNCTIONAL ZERO ON FAMILY HOMELESSNESS WITHIN FIVE YEARS. THEY'RE A MULTI BILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT HOMELESSNESS PREVENTION RENTAL SUPPORT THROUGH CAO WORKS IN NEW HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES FOR PEOPLE AT RISK OF HOMELESSNESS WE ALSO HAVE A NUMBER OF PROPOSALS HERE AT WORKING WITH PROVIDING ECONOMIC RELIEF. TO THOSE MOST GREATLY IMPACTED BY THE PANDEMIC AND THOSE EXPERIENCING POVERTY POVERTY INCLUDING A TWELVE BILLION DOLLAR EXPANSION OF THE GOLDEN STATE STIMULUS A MAXIMUM EIGHT PAYMENT INCREASE OF FIVE POINT IN CAL WORKS. I WE ALSO HAVE PROPOSED HERE IN YOUR AGENDA SIGNIFICANT EXPANSION AND ACCESS WE TALKED ABOUT A BIT ABOUT INFRASTRUCTURE EARLIER THIS AFTERNOON HERE. I TO CHILD CARE SUBSIDIES EARLY EDUCATION AND TO BROADER PREVENTION EFFORTS WE ALSO HAVE A NUMBER OF PROPOSALS THAT WILL STRENGTHEN OUR IMMIGRANT INTEGRATION EFFORTS AS WELL AS SERVICES TO SUPPORT TRIBES OF NATIVE AMERICANS. AND FINALLY WE'RE PROPOSING NEW ECONOMIC MOBILITY OPPORTUNITIES CAREER PATHWAYS AND SUPPORT FOR THOSE WORKING IN THE CARE ECONOMY. TODAY YOU HAVE TO HEAR FROM THE DEPARTMENT LEADERSHIP ACROSS SEVERAL DIFFERENT. PARTS OF THE ORGANIZATION THE ORGANIZATION OF THE MY TRULY. TO WORK IN PARTNERSHIP WITH TO ACHIEVE OUR MISSION AND WITH THAT I'LL TURN IT OVER TO OUR CHIEF DEPUTY TO. CHEN CHOI UP FOR THE FIRST ITEM ON CALPERS THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR. THANK YOU DIRECTOR JOHNSON GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND MEMBERS. GEN SHARIA TO DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES- WITH RESPECTIVE ACCOUNT WORKS PROGRAM WE HAVE EXCITING INVESTMENTS HERE IN SUPPORTING ECONOMIC STABILITY. AND MOBILITY I HAVE BOTH TO CREATE A MORE INCLUSIVE SOCIETY AND WE BELIEVE A MORE RESILIENT ECONOMY. THE STATE'S WELFARE TO WORK PROGRAM IS FUNDED IN THE GOVERNOR'S MAY REVISION AT SIX POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS IN TOTAL FUNDING BUT THEN ANTICIPATED CASELOAD OF OVER THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND FAMILIES. WE WILL NOTE THAT THIS IS LOWER THAN THE ESTIMATED CASELOAD IN THE JANUARY TENTH BUDGET DUE TO UPDATES WITH ACTUAL DATA. BUT IT IS STILL REFLECTING A CASELOAD INCREASE BASED ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT FEDERAL UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS WILL EXPIRE BEGINNING IN SEPTEMBER TWENTY TWENTY ONE. RIGHT IN THE BUDGET- I FIVE POINT 3% TO STRICTER JOHNSON MENTIONED EFFECTIVE OCTOBER FIRST BASED ON THE FUNDING AVAILABLE IN THE CHILD POVERTY AND FAMILY SUPPLEMENTAL SUPPORT ASSEMBLY COUNTS. THIS EQUATES TO I'M NINE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS A MONTH FOR A FAMILY OF THREE AND A HIGH COST COUNTY. BY OUR CALCULATIONS- WHICH INCLUDES ALL OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS BEING AIDED. THAT IS 51% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL IF YOU WANT TO RESPOND THOUGH TO THE QUESTION IN YOUR AGENDA AND NOTE THAT THAT CALCULATION IS NOT THE SAME AS THE ONE THAT THE SENATE HAS USED. TO TRY TO MEASURE POVERTY BY LOOKING AT AN ASSISTANCE UNIT PLUS ONE ADDITIONAL PERSON- THE COMPARISON TO THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL WOULD BE LOWER UNDER THAT METHODOLOGY. IN ADDITION TO THE GRANT INCREASE BAMBI REVISION INCLUDES- ASSISTANCE TO HELP WITH URGENT NECESSITIES FOR FAMILIES UNDER THE PANDEMIC EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE FUND. EXPECT PEACE TO BE ADDITIONAL ONE TIME FRAME NON RECURRING SHORT TERM. BENEFITS AROUND SIX HUNDRED AND FORTY DOLLARS FOR EACH FAMILY RECEIVING WORKS. IN THE REVISION ALSO INCLUDES OVERPAYMENT RELEASED OUR POLICY CHANGES WITH RESPECT TO CAL WORKS BE INVESTMENT THAT THE CHAIR ALREADY MENTIONS. RESPECTED INDIAN HEALTH CLINICS AND INCLUDES AS WELL NINE MILLION DOLLARS IN TO SUPPORT FAMILY REUNIFICATION THIS FUNDING IS TO ENSURE THAT. PARENTS WHOSE CHILDREN HAVE BEEN REMOVED TO WORK HOW WORKS RECIPIENTS ARE ABLE TO CONTINUE RECEIVING CASH ASSISTANCE IN ORDER TO KEEP STABILITY SO THAT WE INCREASE THEIR CHANCES OF BEING ABLE TO WORK TOWARD UNIFICATION. SO I HAVE HERE WITH ME THIS AFTERNOON DR JENNIFER HERNANDEZ WAS OUR DEPUTY DIRECTOR OVER THE FAMILY ENGAGEMENT AND EMPOWERMENT DIVISION AND SHE AND I BOTH STAND READY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT WE CAN- FROM THE CHAIR OR MEMBERS ON CALIPHATE. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH- LMAO. AND CHAIR JEANNIE BELOW WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. ALLEN YOU'RE STILL IN THE PROCESS OF REVIEWING THE PACKAGE OF PROPOSALS THAT'S IN FRONT OF YOU FOR THE MAY REVISION FOR CAL WORK. AND WE WILL IN THE COMING WEEK OR SO CONTINUE TO UPDATE YOU WITH ANY NEW FINDINGS AND ANALYSIS. AT FIRST LOOK AS IF THAT DEPUTY DIRECTOR VENTURA JUST MENTIONED THE CASELOAD IS LOWER AND SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE PANDEMIC. OUR OFFICE HAS BEEN FORECASTING MUCH LOWER CASE LOADS THEN THE ADMINISTRATION. AND WHAT WE WOULD SAY IS THE MAY REVISION REALLY NARROWS THAT GAP WE'RE STILL TAKING A CLOSER LOOK AT IT. IF WE WOULD RECOMMEND ANY REVISIONS BUT THE DIFFERENCE IS NOTHING CLOSE TO THE DIFFERENCES WE WERE RECOGNIZING AT THISTIME LAST YEAR SO THAT THE DIFFERENCE IN OUR CASE THAT ESTIMATE. HAS REALLY NARROWED. AFTER ALWAYS BEEN AT IN THE RECENT YEAR HAS SPENT A LOT OF TIME LOOKING AT THE CAL WORKS CASELOAD. AND LOOKING AT THE DECLINE IN THE CASE LOAD. AND WE DO THINK THAT UPON REVIEW OF THE MAY REVISION THERE ARE SOME POLICIES WITHIN THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL THAT HAVE. THE POTENTIAL TO INCREASE OUR CASELOAD. IT'S MAKING SURE THAT THOSE WHO ARE ELIGIBLE ARE MORE LIKELY TO COME IN. AND THOSE THOSE REALLY THOUGH APPEAR TO HAVE MODEST INCREASES. THE FIRST IS THAT THE AS MENTIONED ABOVE FIVE POINT 3% RATE INCREASE. AT THAT WOULD BE PAID FOR OUT OF REALIGNMENT REVENUE. WERE THINKING THAT THAT COULD POTENTIALLY HAVE A MODEST INCREASE OF THE CASELOAD OF I'M OF MAYBE. A FEW THOUSAND CASES. WE WERE ASPECTS I SUBCOMMITTEE STAFF TO TALK ABOUT HOW THIS GRANT INCREASED I'M HERE IS TO. LEGISLATIVE INTENT- AS CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR CHOI A MENTION TO GET BACK ALL CAO WORKS FAMILIES TO FIFTY PERCENT. OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY GUIDELINE FOR A FAMILY THAT IS ONE PERSON LARGER THAN A YOU UNIT THE ASSISTANCE UNIT. I WILL SAY THAT ACTUALLY THAT THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL ALTHOUGH IT I MEAN FOR GRANT INCREASE FOR OUR FAMILIES SO FAR FALLS SHORT OF THE LEGISLATURE SCHOOL. OUT BY OUR CALCULATIONS IT LOOKS LIKE AN AVERAGE SIZE. OUR EX FAMILY WOULD RECEIVE ABOUT A FIFTY DOLLAR INCREASE UNDER THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL. WERE UNDER THE LEGISLATURE ALTERNATE INTENT THAT. WOULD BE CLOSER TO A HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS. BY THE ADMINISTRATION ARE PER. AT USE SOME THE FEDERAL FUNDS TO SET TO SEND TO FIX EIGHT. HUNDRED AND FORTY DOLLAR ONE TIME PAYMENTS ALL CAO WORKS FAMILIES BEGINNING IN JULY. AND THAT'S BUILDING OFF OF A PREVIOUSLY. AT SENT HUNDRED DOLLAR PAYMENT THAT WAS DONE IN THE SPRING AS PART OF THE GOLDEN STATE STIMULUS PACKAGE. AS CONSTRUCTED ALTHOUGH THIS WILL BE A MEANINGFUL INCREASE FOR FAMILIES WE DON'T THINK IT'S LIKELY TO NECESSARILY HAVE A BIG INCREASE IN INCREASING THE NUMBER OF ELIGIBLE FAMILIES TO APPLY. I FOR THE PROGRAM IS SO IF THAT IS OF INTEREST OF THE LEGISLATURE- WE WOULD RECOMMEND THINKING ABOUT MAYBE GIVING YOURSELF A LITTLE BIT OF LEAD TIME BEFORE SENDING OUT THAT GRANTS. AND PERHAPS PACKAGING IT WITH THEM FUNDING FOR SOME OUTREACH MONEY. AGAIN AS OUR INITIAL COMMENTS WILL CONTINUE TO LOOK AT I THINK HOW IT WORKS BUDGET AND TRAILER BILL AS MORE BECOMES AVAILABLE. AND WERE AVAILABLE FOR ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FROM BECCA MYSTERY I GUESS DO YOU DO YOU HAVE ANY COMMENT. YOU GUYS DID YOU ALL THINK IT'S UP TO THE- 50% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY AND THE L. A. O. HAS A DIFFERENCE OF OPINION. OF TIME AND A HALF. YEAH I GUESS AND WHAT I WOULD SAYIS IT'S NOT SO MUCH A DIFFERENCE OF OPINION I THINK WE PROBABLY WOULD AGREE WITH EACH OTHER ABOUT- BOTH OF THE CALCULATIONS THAT WE'RE SHARING. BUT THE DIFFERENCE IS SIMPLE YET ONE OF A DIFFERENT METHODOLOGY OR FORMULA FOR HOW TO ACCESS THE GRANDSONS AGAINST THE POVERTY LEVEL HISTORICALLY IN THE PROGRAM- THE TYPICAL WAY THAT WE HAVE DONE THAT IS TO ACCESS IT FOR AN ASSISTANCE UNIT OF THE EXACT SIZE- OF THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO DO RECEIVE IT. BECAUSE THERE IS A LARGE NUMBER OF- FAMILIES IN THE QUEUE SLOWED WHERE THERE IS AN ADULT WHO IS A NATIVE- I THINK THE LEGISLATURE HAS OPTED TO USE A DIFFERENT FORMULA TO ACCOUNT FOR THAT BY ADDING AN ADDITIONAL. PERSON TO THE SIZE OF THE ASSISTANCE UNIT FOR PURPOSES OF COMPARISON SO THEY'RE TWO DIFFERENT WAYS OF LOOKING AT THAT COMPARISON THERE IS NO SORT OF ONE OFFICIAL WAY TO DO SO. THAT THE ADMINISTRATION'S FORMULA INCLUDES WHICH INCLUDES- THE ASSISTANCE MEMBER UNITS JUST THEMSELVES AND REFLECTS 51% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL IF YOU WERE TO ADD AN ADDITIONAL PERSON WHO'S NOT EVEN BY THE CALYX FROM GRAHAM- AS THE SENATE HAS CHOSEN TO DO IN RECENT YEARS FOR YOUR- LOOK AT IT THEN. THE NUMBERS WOULD BE DIFFERENT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I SEE THE DEPARTMENT. THEIR HAND REYES FUNCTION. JEAN DR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE NOTHING NOT AT THIS TIME OKAY. THANK YOU AND I SAW YOU MATTHEW AT UNANIMOUS AT MISSPELLED YES. YOU WOULD AGREE WITH PARCHMENT YEAH RIGHT YES I AGREE WITH THAT ASSESSMENT OKAY- THANK YOU FOR AND THAT AND NOW AND ACCURATE REMIND ME IF WE IF WE DO. THAT IMPLEMENT THE KIND OF ONE APPLICATION PROCESS ONE DOOR FITS ALL DO WE THINK THIS WILL HELP INCREASE THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE ON CAL WORKS TO BE ABLE TO REACH MORE. I AM I ASSUME THAT YOU'RE REFERRING TO THAT STATEWIDE VERIFICATION HAVE AND WE DO ALSO HAVE BEEN NUMBER EITHER EFFORTS UNDER WAY AS WELL TO ENSURE THAT WE SERVE. WITH HORIZONTAL INTEGRATION I THINK IT'S OFTEN THE DISTRIBUTOR OKAY WELL CHILDHOOD FAMILY APPROACH TO MAKING SURE THAT EVERYTHING THAT ANYONE IS ELIGIBLE FOR IF THEY ARE ABLE TO RECEIVE AND WE DO CERTAINLY HOPE. THAT THOSE APPROACHES AND THE EXISTENCE OF THE STATE RIGHT VERIFICATION HUB WILL MAKE THE PROCESS MORE FRIENDLY FOR FAMILIES AND WILL ENSURE GREATER ACCESS ACROSS THE BOARD. THANK YOU FOR FINDING MY WORDS WHEN I CAN'T. OKAY I THINK THAT IS ALL AT THIS TIME LET'S LET'S LET'S MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER TWO. HOMING HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS.

I'M IT IS IMPORTANT NO THAT YOU KNOW WHEN HE QUESTION WE ARE ABOUT THE PROPOSAL IS REALLY ALL THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL- ARE MEDITATIONS REALLY FIT IN THIS BROADER FRAMEWORK AND WHAT CONTRIBUTION THEY HAVE TO THE GOAL OF ELIMINATING HOMELESSNESS FOR FAMILIES BUT IN FIVE YEARS SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WILL BE WORKING TO REALLY UNDERSTAND THE. THE ROLE THAT THEY PLAY. HOW THEY MAY REVISION DOES PROPOSE TO X. THAT J. PROPOSAL FOR THE NEW PROGRAM TO ACQUIRE. WIRE AND RENOVATE COMMUNITY CARE FACILITIES. MOST OF THE AUGMENTATIONS IN THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES REALLY FOCUS ON EXISTING. I HOUSING PROGRAMS. THE PROPOSAL OF INTENTIONS REALLY REPRESENT VERY LARGE INCREASES TO THE BASELINE FUNDING FOR THESE PROGRAMS SO FOR EXAMPLE. THE STATE TYPICALLY SPENDS ABOUT NINETY FIVE MILLION ANNUALLY ON THE CAL WORKS AS A SUPPORT PROGRAM THAT YOU HEARD ABOUT. AND THE PROPOSAL THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL IS TO PROVIDE AN ADDITIONAL FOUR HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE MILLION. FOR EACH OF THE NEXT TWO TWO YEAR. PROGRAM ONE OF OUR QUESTIONS IS SORT OF WHAT A SECOND WAS DONE TO DETERMINE. AT THE LEVEL OF THE ESTIMATED NEED FOR EACH OF THESE PROGRAMS AND THEN HOW DID THAT ASSESSMENT TRANSLATE TO THE FUNDING LEVEL AND HOW DOES THAT OLD SIMPLY HOPE THE ADMINISTRATION. I REACH THEIR GOAL- IT IN FIVE YEARS. SO I KEEP ALSO BE WHETHER THESE PRO I THE CAPACITY. TO ADMITTED AND SPEND THE NEW FUNDING WITHIN THE TIMELINES OR WHETHER IT WOULD BE IT WOULD MAKE MORE SENSE TO USE US YOU HAVE A SMALLER AMOUNT OF MONEY OVER A LONGER PERIOD OF TIME. HAVE YOU HEARD TODAY WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE ADMINISTRATION ANTICIPATES INTRODUCING TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE FOR SOME OF THESE PROGRAMS. WHICH ARE REALLY MAKE MODIFICATIONS TO HOW THEY OPERATE TODAY. SO THEY COULD BE ONE FACTOR THERE BILL IS RELEASED THEY COULD AND IT COULD CONTAIN. I CHANGES THAT WOULD ADDRESS SOME OF THE KNOWN BARRIERS TO THE PROGRAM SOME OF THE CHALLENGES ACCESS. FOR EXAMPLE NEEDING TO HAVE AN EVICTION NOTICE ON HAND AT THAT COULD BE SOMETHING THAT FEET THE TRAILER BILL CONTEMPLATES. AT ANOTHER IDEA THAT WAS MENTIONED IN IN YOUR AGENDA AND IN PREVIOUS. MEETINGS OF THE SUB COMMITTEE WAS EVERY CONSIDERATION OF THAT COUNTY MATCH REQUIREMENT- ARE ALLOWING FOR MORE FLEXIBILITY IN THE USE OF THE FUNDS. AT YOUR DESS THINGS THAT MAYBE THE CURRENT PROGRAMS DON'T ALLOW THOSE ARE ALL THINGS THAT ARE MINE THAT WILL BE LOOKING. AT WHEN WE RECEIVED THAT THE TRAILER BILL AND ARE ALL. THINGS. FOR THIS PROPOSAL NOW FOR THIS UPDATED PROPOSAL WHICH WE THINK IS VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE- LIKE I WAS IMPORTANT BEFORE BUT IT WITH THE ENHANCED FUNDING IT'S PROBABLY EVEN MORE IMPORTANT NOW THAT WE HAVE THE- RIGHT UNDERSTANDING OF THE PROGRAM'S PARAMETERS ARE EXPECTATIONS. OVERSIGHT MECHANISMS THAT PASSED SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE WILL DEFINITELY BE TAKING A CLOSE LOOK AT WHEN IT WHEN IT'S AVAILABLE. AT EITHER TO SOME OF OUR INITIAL THOUGHTS AND WE'RE HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS AND WILL CONTINUE TO ADVISE YOU AS WE AS WE LEARN MORE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF MR CAN CAN YOU CAN YOU SPEAK TO THAT THE FIRST THE FIRST ISSUE THE L. A- RAISED ABOUT HOW DO THESE PLANS. DO WHAT WHAT DO YOUR METRICS WHAT ARE YOUR PLANS TO ACTUALLY HOW ARE THESE GOING TO REDUCE- ELIMINATE HOMELESSNESS FOR FAMILIES AND FIVE YEARS. YEAH I GOT ABSOLUTELY SO I'LL JUST START BY SAYING THAT DEBT DEPARTMENT SOCIAL SERVICES HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS PROGRAMS SERVED OVER A HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE- ACROSS THE STATE IN TWENTY TWENTY ALONE SO- OF COURSE. KEEPING A GOOD EXAMPLE OF THE ABILITY OF US TO WORK WITH COUNTIES TO STAND UP PROGRAM'S REALLY QUICKLY AND IN A RESPONSIBLE WAY. WE WERE ABLE TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF SHELTER BEDS THAT EXIST ACROSS THE WHOLE SYSTEM OF CARE. BY OVER 50% IN A MATTER. OF MONTHS THE INVESTMENT PROJECT. YOU CAN BRING MANY OF THOSE LAST LEARNED. AND ACTIVISTS WORK. I DIDN'T GET WHY CAN CHECK READ SHARE SOME OF THE NUMBER TO MAKE EARLIER ABOUT. THE TOTAL WHICH WE CAN NOW TRACK THROUGH THE HOMELESS DATA INFORMATION. DOES THAT- COLLECTS ALL OF THE LOCAL HOMELESSNESS AND ROLLED UP INTO. ONE EIGHT FOR FOUND. WE HAVE PROVIDED SOME INSIGHTS TERMS OF THAT MEASURE THAT- WORK YEAH HE'S IN- WE AT IN TWENTY- THERE WERE ALMOST THIRTY THOUSAND FAMILIES THAT TOUCHED THE HOMELESS SYSTEM. WORKER HOUSING ANNEX YEAH AN EXPANSION OF PROGRAMS THAT WOULD BE ABLE TO DO THAT BUT KEEP IN MIND THAT'S IN ONE YEAR ALONE. BUT BIG PART OF OUR ABILITY TO BRING FAMILY HOMELESSNESS TO FUNCTIONAL ZERO IS ALSO. THREE CONVENTION AFTER WHICH IS. KIND OF A PART OF THE PROJECT I HAD EXPECTED RESOLUTION ON WE NEED STOP THE- YEAH AND ASTOR. THAT ARE CURRENTLY HOMELESS BY PROVIDING THEM THAT. BUT LET ME JUST DESCRIBE QUICKLY THAT THE HOUSING SUPPORT PROGRAM WHICH PROVIDES. EMERGENCY TEMPORARY SHELTER IT PROVIDES RAPID RE HOUSING WHICH IS AN EVIDENCE BASED PRACTICE WE GET PEOPLE IMMEDIATELY AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE INTO THEIR OWN UNITS I'M SURPRISED THAT UNIT AND WRAPAROUND. MANY OTHER OF OUR SOCIAL SAFETY NET PROGRAMS THAT'S A BIG ADVANTAGE OF THE WORK THAT WE DO I. DS AFTER THAT WE- WERE NOTHING. THE WHOLE FAMILY- THROUGH OUR SUITE OF. SOCIAL. SAFETY NET PROGRAMS OUT OF OUR DEPARTMENT- AND THEN OF. I WILL. PARTNERING BECAUSE- WITH- ARE OUR SISTER AGENCIES AGE AND PARTICULAR CD I THROUGH THEIR HOME HE INVESTMENT WHICH WILL HELP US TO ACTUALLY CREATE NEW HOUSING UNITS. THAT WILL ALIGN REALLY WELL WITH THE WORK THEY WERE TRAINED TO DEAL WITH HOUSING HOUSING SUPPORT PROGRAM. TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN- PURCHASE. WE KNOW STONE I LIKE TO SAY WE'RE GOING TO BUILD NEW HOUSING BUT ALSO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF EXISTING HOUSING ON THE MARKET. VIEWS USE RENTAL SUBSIDIES TO QUICKLY GT FAMILIES. INTO HOUSING AND HOUSING THAT MEETS THEIR NEEDS AND ALLOW. OKAY OKAY- CAN YOU SPEAK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE COMMUNITY CARE EXPANSION PROGRAM- AND I KNOW WE'RE GONNA TALK ABOUT SS I SS P. LATER BECAUSE IT JUST SEEMS. I MEAN WE CAN WE CAN HELP STABILIZE SOME OF THESE BUT IF WE DON'T RAISE A REIMBURSEMENT LEVEL THEN. THEY CAN'T AFFORD TO STAY IN BUSINESS RIGHT I MEAN SO THAT THIS IS A TWO PRONGED ISSUE SO TELL ME HOW SO TELL ME HOW THIS PROBLEM IS GOING TO INCREASE CAPACITY AND I WAS TRYING TO SAY. RIGHT NOW THERE ARE FIFTEEN THOUSAND. PEOPLE HOW MANY MORE D WE HOPE TO GET WITH THIS THAT WITH THIS INFUSION. THANK YOU GREAT QUESTION SO THE COMMUNITY CARE EXPANSION IS ALL ABOUT EXPANSION AND PRESERVATION WE WANT TO EXPAND THE NUMBER OF- THE PHILLIES BUT CANNOT CONSERVE PEOPLE WHO RUN SS I SS II. AND PEOPLE WHO ARE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS RIGHT. THANK YOU. SO I'M WE DO THAT BY. ACTORS AND RE. AND THEN USING. USE RESTRICTIONS JUST THAT AT THESE UNITS MUST. POPULATE ON THE PRESERVATION SIDE IT CAN BE THINGS LIKE I GOT IT THE SILLY- WHAT I NEED IF I'M GONNA GO OUT OF BUSINESS BUT WHAT I NEED IS A NEW ROOF SO HOW CAN BE FUNDS THE RE HAVE TO SHORE UP THE DEFERRED MEET. ANY KIND SETTINGS THAT THEY CAN CONTINUE TO OPERATE AS PART OF OUR HOUSING KIANA WE ALSO- HAVE DESIGNED A PROGRAM IN A WAY THAT- ALIGNS WITH SOME OF THE OTHER TOOLS AT OUR DISPOSAL TO SUPPORT PEOPLE WHO WERE LIVING. IN ADULT AND SENIOR CARE FACILITIES MANY COUNTIES ARE WORKING CLOSELY WITH THESE TYPES OF FACILITIES EITHER WORK ON PROVIDE FUNDING DIRECTLY TO THE FACILITY FOR AUXILIARY SERVICES OR IN SOME CASES IN KIND SUPPORT THEY MAY LATER ON- ON SITE SUPPORTIVE SERVICES HELP. HELP ACTUALLY MEET THE WHOLE NEEDS OF FOLKS WHO WORK WHO ARE HOUSED IN THE SETTINGS- DON'T YOU KNOW THAT. BRINGING NEW YOU KNOW HOW BY. ACCORDING COST OF THE ACTORS AND READ. OR THAT FOR ME. IS A PART OF PLANNED MAKE SURE THAT WE AND HER THIS BILL IN. AND WE IMPART HOME MANY MANY BEDS QUALITY HOW MANY BEDS DO WE THINK WE CAN EXPAND HERE WE HAVE A GOAL. YEAH WE ARE PROJECTED TO BE ABLE TO BRING ON FIVE THOUSAND YOU BET. AND PRESERVE. ABOUT FOUR THOUSAND. THANK OKAY OKAY. ALL RIGHT SO WE WILL WE WILL ALL BE LOOKING FORWARD TO THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE ON THIS- GOING FORWARD I THINK IT'S IT IS A- AGAIN- WE ALL AGREE WITH THAT WE ALL AGREE WITH THE MAGNITUDE OF THE PROBLEM. BUT JUST HAVING THE CHECKS AND BALANCES AND TO ACTUALLY. ADDRESS IT WITHOUT WITHOUT CREATING POCKETS OF FRAUD AND MAKING SURE THAT THE PEOPLE WHO NEED TO BE HELPED ARE REALLY HELPED. AND TO MAKE IT I THINK THAT. THE SOME CONFIRM LOCAL GOVERNMENT ALWAYS AS EASY AS WE CAN FOR OUR LOCALS TO BE ABLE TO IMPLEMENT AND SO IF THERE'S- IF THAT THE COUNTY MATCHES IT CAN SOMETIMES BE DIFFICULT I MEAN WILL LET LET'S LET'S ALWAYS LOOK AT WAYS. TO ADD TO GET RID OF THOSE AND- AND THE OTHER THING THAT. I THINK STAFF AND I AND WE ALL JUST WANT TO KEEP RAISING THIS IDEA OF THEM SOMETIMES WE DON'T LIKE IT AND I APPRECIATE THAT YOU HAVE TO HOUSING STABILIZATION. SO THAT PEOPLE DON'T FALL OUT AND THEN HAVE TO BECOME HOMELESS BEFORE WE CAN HELP THEM- IN THOSE KINDS OF- NINTENDED CONSEQUENCES THAT WE CREATE SOMETIMES. CAN BE INCREDIBLY. M. A- THE DEVASTATING- AND LET ME JUST SAY WHAT WITH WITH THE- THE H. STEP PROGRAM I TO GET MORE PEOPLE ON SSI IS GREAT. BUT IT BUT AGAIN IF WE DON'T EXPAND THE AMOUNT OF BAD THERE'S A LOT OF FOLKS ON THE STREETS RIGHT NOW- WITH SSI AND THEY CANNOT FIND A GOOD PLACEMENT. YOU KNOW WE TALKED EARLIER ABOUT CHILDREN'S BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT THERE ARE ADULTS ON THE STREET RIGHT NOW WHOSE FAMILIES HAVE TRIED TO HELP THEM SINCE THEY WERE CHILDREN. AND ARE NOW STILL TRYING TO HELP THEM AND STILL CANNOT FIND STABLE HOUSING. FOR OUR SERIOUSLY AND PERSISTENTLY MENTALLY ILL POPULATION SO. THE- THE I AM THE APPS THAT THE HOUSING TO STEP DOWN ALL OF THAT IS VITALLY IMPORTANT WE FIGURE OUT A WAY. TO MAKE IT WORK. AND YOU ARE. ABSOLUTELY CORRECT THAT IF WE CAN AND YOU SAID THE BEGINNING PREVENT HIM FROM GETTING HOMELESS OR RAPIDLY RE HOUSING PEOPLE. IS LIKE TRYING TO AVOID THAT FIRST. PSYCHOTIC BREAK IF WE CAN PREVENT THAT OR OR MINIMIZE IT QUICKLY THEN WE HAVE. WAY BETTER CHANCES FOR LATER- OKAY ALL RIGHT AND THEN THE ISSUE OF WE'LL TALK ABOUT LOCAL ENTITIES PERHAPS NOT HAVING A MATCH AND BEING ABLE TO THINK ABOUT- SOME OF THOSE THINGS TO. OKAY ALL RIGHT THEN LET'S MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER THREE AUTOMATION PROGRAMS. GOOD AFTERNOON AND SELENA CHAU CHIEFOPERATING OFFICER AT THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES AND I'LL BE GOING OVER THE KEY CHANGES IN THE MAYOR VISION FOR THE DEPARTMENT'S AUTOMATION PROGRAMS THAT ARE LAID OUT IN THE ENGINE. THE FIRST TWO ITEMS ARE RELATED TO THE STATEWIDE AUTOMATED WATER SYSTEM WHICH IS USEDFOR THE ELIGIBILITY DETERMINATION AT HOWARD'S RESTAURANTS. AND SO THE FIRST ITEM OF ONE POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS- SIX AND A FIFTY THOUSAND GENERAL FUND. IS NEEDED TO UPDATE THE NOTICE OF DENIAL OR PENDING STATUS FORM THIS IS A FORM USED BY COUNTIES JUNE THIRD BY HOUSEHOLDS OF THEIR APPLICATION STATUS AT THE NATIONAL APPLICATION AND RECERTIFICATION. AND IT NEEDS TO BE UPDATED TO INCLUDE HE SPECIFIC INFORMATION REGARDING THE REASON FOR DENIAL OR THE PENDING STATUS OF THE CASE IN ORDER TO COMPLY. WITH THE FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS. THE I IN- RELATED TO THE CONSOLIDATED PORTAL AND SMALL FUNCTIONALITY WITHIN THE COUNCIL'S MIGRATION TO A SINGLE SYSTEM. AND THE MILLION DOLLARS GENERAL FRIENDS IS TO INCORPORATE TRANSLATIONS INTO TWENTY ACTUAL LANGUAGES THIS SUPPORT THE DEPARTMENT'S MISSION AND GOAL TO PROVIDE QUALITY SERVICES WITH A FOCUS ON EQUITY INCLUSION AND STATE OR CITY AND- RESEARCH. AND THEN THE ENTERPRISE DATA INFRASTRUCTURE THIS IS A THREE MILLION DOLLAR GENERAL FUND REQUESTS CHIU IMPROVE OUR DEPARTMENT'S DATA ACQUISITION AND PROCESSING OPERATIONS. THIS WOULD ALLOW US TO PROCURE NEW INTEGRATION AND DATA WAREHOUSE PLATFORMS EXPAND THE DEPARTMENT'S CURRENT CAPACITY AROUND YOU TO CAPTURE STORAGE AND PROCESSING AND ALLOW US TO HAVE MORE ROBUST DATA ANALYTICS AND INTERSECTIONS ACROSS MULTIPLE PROGRAMS WITH PARTIDA. THREE ARE RELATED TO THE CHILD WELFARE SERVICES DATA SYSTEMS. FIRST ONE IS THE ONE POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS OR FIVE HUNDRED EIGHTY THREE THOUSAND GENERAL PLANS FOR COUNTIES TO SUPPORT THE CBS DATA CLEAN UP ACTIVITIES. CURRENT SYSTEM INCLUDES A LOT OF PEOPLE CAN'T DETER THAT'S INHERENT IN THE HISTORIC ARCHITECTURE OF THE SYSTEM AND SO THIS DATA CLEANUP IS NEEDED TO INSURE THAT CLEAN DATA IS CONVERTED TO THE NEW CARE SYSTEM THAT'S UNDER DEVELOPMENT. AND THEN THE- ESTIMATES MIGRATION SO THIS IS FIVE POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS ONE POINT TWO MILLION GENERAL FUND. TO MIGRATE EXISTING PLATFORMS SO THAT IT CAN BE SUPPORTED BY MICROSOFT AND IBM THE CURRENT PLATFORM IS ANTIQUATED AND WILL NO LONGER BE SUPPORTED. SERVICE MIGRATIONS THE UPDATED PLATFORM WILL HELP ALLEVIATE ANY POTENTIAL RISKS OF DESTRUCTION OR STOPPAGE WHICH COULD OCCUR WITH MICROSOFT HALF PATCHES IN OUR- OPERATING SYSTEM UPGRADES. NO NO I ITEM IS. REVISED FOR. OUR CARE PROJECT REQUESTING THIRTY POINT FOUR MILLION GENERAL FUND. RESPONDING THIRTY ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION FOR ALL BILL WITH THAT- AND NOT REPLACE IT COSTS YOU. HARMON'S A SERVICE. DISSIPATION ACTIVITIES FOR OUR USER CENTERED DESIGN FUNCTIONS AND IT ALSO INCLUDES AN UPDATED SCHEDULE REFLECTS THE LATEST DELIVERY APPROACH WHICH WE MET DR ED- THAT WOULD DEPLOY PRODUCTION INCREMENTALLY AND MODULES AND THEN THAT WOULD LATER BE FOLLOWED BY A FULL FUNCTIONALITY WHEN IT REPLACES A SENIOR US CMS. SIR THAT'S SEEING. THE OVERVIEW OF THE AUTOMATION CHANGES ON HOW. THE ANSWERING QUESTIONS THANK YOU VERY MUCH- DEPARTMENT FINANCE ANYTHING. THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT FINANCE NOTHING TO ADD AT THIS TIME. LMAO HELLO WITH THE L. A. WE'RE KICKING OFF A CLOSE LOOK AT ALL OF THESE REQUESTS I WOULD JUST STAY ON THE LAST ONE THE CWS CARE IS REQUEST WE ARE WORKING WITH THE ADMINISTRATION ON BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE TO ENSURE THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS APPROPRIATE OVERSIGHT OF THE PROJECT AS IT MOVES THROUGH THE DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH YEAH I WOULD I WOULD CONCUR AT. ALL ALL ALL ALWAYS ALL THINGS WITH THE I. T. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE- GOOD OVERSIGHT ON THAT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE IDENTIFY ISSUES EARLIER THAN LATER- AS WE TEND TO HEAR ABOUT HIM OUT. OUT IN THE PUBLIC- VERY QUICKLY SO- WILL BE EAGER TO SEE THAT BUDGET TRAILER LANGUAGE WHEN IT COMES UP WITH THE- F. PLAN THE EVALUATION AND THE- FEEDBACK LOOPS ALL BUILT INTO. OKAY ISSUE NUMBER. FOUR JENNIFER TRY AGAIN WITH THE DEPARTMENT- ISSUE NUMBER FOUR RELATES TO SS I SS P. WHICH IS ALREADY BEEN THE SUBJECT OF- QUITE A BIT OF DISCUSSION. HERE TO DAVE THIS PARTICULAR ITEM IS MORE ABOUT THE GRANT IN THE PROGRAM SO AS YOU KNOW THE PROGRAM SERVES. OUR ELDERS IN INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES WHO ARE LOW INCOME AND PROVIDES CASH ASSISTANCE. THE INCREASE PROVIDED IN THE MAY REVISION IS TWO FOLD ONE IS REFLECTING AND SSI COLOGNE COMING FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. AND THE SECOND IS REFLECTING THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL FOR AN INCREASE TO THE S. S. P. PORTION OR THE STATE SUPPLEMENTAL PORTION. OF THE PAYMENT- THE RESULTS OF THAT AND INCREASES IN. FOCUSED ON INDIVIDUALS WHOSE GRANTS WOULD GO FROM- NINE HUNDRED AND FIFTY FIVE DOLLARS A MONTH IN TWENTY TWO. AND THE CONNECTION AND THE REASON FOR THE FOCUS ON THE GRANTS FOR INDIVIDUALS RATHER THAN COUPLES IS RELATED TO A REDUCTION THAT WAS SPECIFICALLY FOCUSED ON INDIVIDUALS. A SEVERAL YEARS AGO DURING THE GREAT RECESSION THE RESULTS OF THE GRANT INCREASE AT PROPOSED IN THE GOVERNOR'S MAY REVISION WOULD BE A GROUND LEVEL THAT IS EQUIVALENT TO WHAT WAS PROVIDED IN TWENTY ELEVEN- AS YOUR AGENDA NOTES THIS IS NOT A FULL RESTORATION OF ALL. REDUCTIONS THAT OCCURRED OVER THE COURSE OF SEVERAL DECADES OR ALL FOUR GRAND. YOU SEE YOURS. IS NONETHELESS A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE THAT IS INCLUDED IN THE GOVERNOR'S MEAN REVERSION- I HAVE AT OUR DEPUTY DIRECTOR DEBBIE THOMPSON HERE WITH ME AND WE WOULD BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- THE PARTNER FINANCE. BRITISH ASSUME CONTINUE TO FINANCE FURTHER COMMENTS AT THIS TIME HELLO. THANK YOU PROCEED WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST OFFICE AND WE WERE ASKED BY STAFF TO HIGHLIGHT AREAS WHERE ME REVISION PROPOSALS MAY NOT FULLY ALIGNED WITH LEGISLATIVE OR SENATE PRIORITIES I'M SO FOR AND AGAIN OUR COMMENTS TODAY REFLECT OUR CURRENT UNDERSTANDING OF THESE PROPOSALS AND WILL PROVIDE UPDATES AS WE LEARN MORE IF NEEDED- BUT BEFORE WE DIG INTO THE EXERCISES PETE GRANT INCREASE PROPOSAL SPECIFICALLY. A BROADER POINT OUR OFFICE HAS MADE ABOUT THE BUDGET AND ITS TOTALITY IS THAT WHILE THE ADMINISTRATION IS DIRECTING RESOURCES I'M TO PROP UP NEW SOCIAL SERVICE INTERVENTIONS WE DO NOT NECESSARILY SEE THE SAME AUGMENTATION LEVELS AND MAJOR SAFETY NET PROGRAMS LIKE A SCIENCE S. P. I'M- NOW SPECIFICALLY REGARDING THE ADMINISTRATION'S S. S. P. GRANT. INCREASE WHICH BASED OFF OF OUR ROUGH CALCULATIONS WOULD ESSENTIALLY INCREASE GRANTS FOR INDIVIDUALS BY TEN DOLLARS- WELL THAT'S A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION RELATIVE TO LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES IT STILL ISN'T IN FULL ALIGNMENT SPECIFICALLY- AS A PART OF THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN NIGHT ARE TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN BUDGET ACT OF THE LEGISLATURE PASSED INTENT LANGUAGE- TO BEGIN TO PROVIDE ONGOING. COLAS OR COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENTS TO THE S. S. B. PORTION OF THE GRANT BEGINNING IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWENTY TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR AM AT OUR TWO TWENTY TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE AND I'S OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL BEYOND THIS I'M GREAT INCREASE DOESN'T PROVIDE ANY FUTURE COAL ONCE. I'M ADDITIONALLY WE WOULD JUST LIKE TO FLAG THAT AS A PART OF THE MASTER PLAN FOR AGING- IT WAS INCLUDED. WITHIN THEIR STRATEGY THEIR BROADER STRATEGY ON ANTI POVERTY- THE OVERALL GOAL OF INCREASING EXERCISES PEAK GRANTS TO THE ELDER ECONOMIC INDEX OR THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL TO THE EXTENT THAT FUNDS WERE PROVIDED- I ALSO JUST LIKE TO FLAG BASED OFF OF A ROUGH CALCULATION IN TERMS OF WHAT WHERE DOES THIS GET. RECIPIENTS THAT BASED OFF OF THAT F. P. L. RUSH HOLD BUT WAS ALSO RAISED IN LAST WEEK SENATE BUDGET HEARING- IT'S BASED OF OUR ROUGH CALCULATIONS WE FIND THAT RECIPIENTS ARE STILL- FURTHER AWAY FROM THE F. P. L. THAN THEY WERE RELATIVES- TWO TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN LEVELS. SO WITH THAT SAID THE LEGISLATURE COULD VIEW THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL AGAIN AS PERHAPS A STARTING POINT- AND TO THE EXTENT THAT THE LEGISLATURE IS INTERESTED IN PICKING A DIFFERENT GRANT THRESHOLD THAT PERHAPS- RESTORES A GREATER SHARE OF THE PAST S. S. P. REDUCTIONS. THAT'S AN OPTION THAT WE'D BE HAPPY TO ASSIST THE LEGISLATURE AND- BUT THEN ALSO ANY OTHER OPTIONS AT THE LEGISLATURE'S CONSIDERING HAPPY TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH- YEAH I GUESS. I GUESS THAT THAT IS THE QUESTION AND IN THE BILLIONS. AND BILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS THAT WE'RE GONNA. INITIALLY INVEST IN NEW. AND IN TRYING TO DO AS MUCH OUTRAGE AS WE CAN TO GET MORE PEOPLE. INTO CAL WORKS IN DIFFERENT KINDS OF PROGRAMS- WE ALREADY HAVE THIS PROGRAM. AT THAT IS THAT WOULD THAT WE ALREADY HAVE A AT. A SITTING DEMOGRAPHIC THERE WHO WE KNOW ARE VERY POOR PEOPLE OFTENTIMES WITH DISABILITIES WHY NOT INVEST MORE IN THEIR- TO GET PEOPLE AGAIN WITH THE TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN. POVERTY RATES ARE YOU KNOW THAT'S THAT'S A DECADE AGO ITEM AND TO. EVERYBODY'S COST OF LIVING HAS GONE UP TREMENDOUSLY- I HAVE I HAVE CLOSE FRIENDS. WHO ARE ON SS I SS PETER I HAVE I HELP EVERY MONTH BECAUSE IT IS JUST NOT ENOUGH. TO MAKE IT THROUGH. AN WELL COMMUNITY SUPPORT IS IMPORTANT- WE DON'T WANT TO JUST DEPEND UPON THE KINDNESS OF OUR FRIENDS. AND NEIGHBORS- TO MAKE THREE POSTER WE HAVE ENOUGH TO EAT EVERY MONTH SO CAN YOU SPEAK A LITTLE BIT TOO. THE RATIONALE TOWARDS NOT INCREASING- THE GRANT ADDITIONALLY A LITTLE BIT MORE THAN TEN DOLLARS- TO THIS EXISTING POOL OF PEOPLE THAT WE ALREADY HAVE THAT WE KNOW- NEED HELP. I'M NOT SURE IF THAT WAS ADDRESS TESTER TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I THINK FOR OUR PART I THINK WE- MIGHT BE HELPFUL TO- EMPHASIZE WITH RESPECT TO EXERCISES THE RECIPIENTS BUT WE- CERTAINLY RECOGNIZE THEIR VULNERABILITY AND THIS INVESTMENT IS IMPORTANT TO US- AS A AS A MEANS OF INCREASING INCOME- FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS. AND AS WE JUST DISCUSSED IN THAT PRIOR ITEMS- B. E. INVESTMENTS ON HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS SIDE WILL ALSO BENEFIT MANY OF THESE RECIPIENTS. IN ADDITION IN RECENT YEARS WE HAVE EXPANDED CALFRESH TWO SS I SS P. RECIPIENTS TO ENSURE THAT% THERE'S GREATER ACCESS TO NUTRITION BENEFITS. SO THERE IS SORT OF MORE THAN ONE THING THAT IS A BENEFIT TO THIS POPULATION AND THAT IS IMPORTANT TO US- BUT WE CERTAINLY. HEAR YOU AND APPRECIATE THE IMPORTANCE OF THAT INCOME LEVEL OVER ALL AND THE CHALLENGES. THAT THESE RECIPIENTS SPACE. THANK YOU AND I THINK IMPORTANT. THAT THAT THAT THE ADMINISTRATION I THINK HAS DONE A- HAS IS MADE HAS MADE REDUCING POVERTY A REAL FOCUS AND WE DO AND WE DO APPRECIATE THAT. AND WE JUST KNOW THAT THE NEED IS GREAT AND SO- YEAH. WE WANT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE PUT TO HELP- WHERE IT IS IT IS IT IS. MOST LIKELY TO DO GOOD. OKAY SO WE WILL TALK MORE AND THEN WILL OF COURSE LOOK FORWARD TO THAT BUDGET TRAILER LANGUAGE WHEN IT WHEN IT COMES SO WE CAN WE CAN BETTER ANALYZE. WHAT'S GOING ON. OKAY ISSUE NUMBER FIVE. BUT IF I CAN JUST SAY AGAIN EVERY SINGLE TIME FOR THE RECORD. RAISING THESE RATES ESPECIALLY FOR THOSE IN OUT OF HOME PLACEMENTS SO THOSE BUSINESSES CAN STAY OPEN- I DON'T KNOW WHAT HOW HOW WE CAN CREATE A DA VIDA SYSTEM. NOT NOT THAT I WANT EVERYTHING TO GO FOR PROFIT BUT IT IS JUST WHEN WE- WHEN WE ATTACH DOLLARS TO SOMETHING. WE SEE THE PROLIFERATION WHEN WE DON'T ATTACH DOLLARS TO SOMETHING. WE SEE DECIMATION SO. WE GET TO MAKE WE GET TO MAKE CHOICES. OKAY ISSUE NUMBER FIVE. THANK YOU- EGGMAN THAT ISSUE NUMBER FIVE IS WITH RESPECT TO BE. IN HOME SUPPORTIVE SERVICES PROGRAM SO CRITICAL PERSONAL CARE SERVICES. AND ALLOW OUR ELDERS AND INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES TO REMAIN SAFELY AT HOME- V. AT CRITICAL PROPOSALS WITHIN THE H. EFFECT PROGRAM IN THE NAY REVISION INCLUDE. AND ELIMINATION OF THE SERVICES THAT- RECIPIENTS. ARE AUTHORIZED TO RECEIVE THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE REPEALING THAT REDUCTION AND SUSPENSION- WAS POSTED ON THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE'S WEBSITE TODAY. AND THEN THE REVISION ALSO INCLUDES- TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE TO MAINTAIN THE TRADITIONAL STATE AND COUNTY SHARING RATIOS WITH RESPECT TO. NON FEDERAL. COSTS RELATED TO BARGAINING. IT MAY RIVER INCLUDES AS WELL AND INVESTMENT IN A PERMANENT AN ON GOING BACK UP PROVIDER SYSTEM TO ENSURE THAT WHEN THERE IS AN IMMEDIATE HEALTH AND SAFETY RISK RECIPIENTS RECEIVE ASSISTANCE AND THERE IS A GREATER SAFETY NET OF. UTILITY TO PROVIDE SERVICES TO MEET THEIR NEEDS- THERE IS TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE IN THE MAY REVISION AS WELL TO- GOVERN OUR COLLABORATION WITH STAKEHOLDERS IN AN EFFORT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE ABLE TO COME INTO COMPLIANCE WITH REQUIREMENTS FROM CMS. RELATED TO ELECTRONIC VISIT VERIFICATION AND THE VERIFICATION OF A PROVIDER'S LOCATION WHEN THEY PROVIDE SERVICES OUR INTENTION IS CERTAINLY TO DO THAT IN THE LEAST INTRUSIVE MANNER POSSIBLE- BUT THERE ARE THINGS THAT WE DO NEED TO- I UNDER CURRENT GUIDANCE FROM. THE ADVANCE- IT WOULD ALSO HIGHLIGHT THAT THE NAY REVISION INCLUDES AN INVESTMENT IN LONG TERM CARE CAREER PATHWAYS- AND ENSURING THAT WE ARE ABLE TO SUPPORT PROVIDERS- AS THE- AS THEY BOTH BECOME AYE AGES THAT'S PROVIDERS AND CONTINUE WITHIN THE PROFESSION AND PERHAPS AND MOVE INTO HIGHER LEVEL- POSITIONS WITHIN THE HEALTHCARE INDUSTRY- AND WITH THAT I WILL TURN IT OVER TO OUR DEPUTY DIRECTOR DEBBIE THOMPSON WHO CAN ANSWER SOME OF THE MORE SPECIFIC QUESTIONS THAT ARE IN YOUR AGENDA AS WELL. THANK YOU HI GOOD AFTERNOON DEBBIE THOMPSON ADULT PROGRAMS DEPUTY- AT I WAS JUST GOING TO ASK FOLLOW UP ON THE REMAINDER OF THE QUESTIONS FOR YOU AND CHEN DID ADDRESS QUESTION TO WHICH IS THAT THE TRAILER BILL HAS BEEN RELEASED REPEALING- THE SEVEN PERCENT. AND THE SECOND QUESTION AROUND THE SIXTY FIVE THIRTY FIVE PERCENT- FINDING OF THE NON FEDERAL SHARE THE AND THAT CONTINUING. THE QUESTION WAS WHETHER OR NOT THAT WAS AN ONGOING PROPOSAL AND YES IT IS AN ONGOING PROPOSAL- D. CAREER PATHWAYS. THAT JANET WAS JUST. MENTIONING IN TALKING ABOUT TO SUPPORT R. I. HSS PROVIDERS. WITH BOTH- ENHANCING IN GAINING ADDITIONAL SKILLS TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THE BEST SERVICES POSSIBLE TO OUR I JUST LAST- PROVIDERS AND ALSO. I'M GIVING THEM ADDITIONAL SKILLS IF THEY- SO CHOOSE TO MOVE INTO OTHER- HEALTH CARE RELATED TYPE FEELS. THE FUNDING IS GOING TO BE SUPPORTING A NUMBER OF THINGS IT WILL SUPPORT AB CONTRACTING WITH A VENDOR TO PROVIDE- BACK TRAINING. IT WILL INCLUDE STATE BINS FOR- PROVIDERS AS THEY COMPLETE OUR STEPS WITHIN THOSE KINDS OF TRAINING ACTIVITIES. IT WILL INCLUDE- IT TEER DEVELOPMENT AND NAVIGATION THE SUPPORT FOR THE PROVIDERS AS THEY- ENHANCE THEIR SKILLS AND LOOK AT OUR NEXT STEPS TO. INCREASE THEIR THEIR THEIR SKILLS AND TRAINING. IT WILL ALSO INCLUDE OUTREACH. AND COUNTY ADMINISTRATIVE. COSTS TO OUR HAVE THE CAL PROVIDE NECESSARY- IT THROUGH THIS PROCESS- TO OUR PROVIDERS AS WELL THERE ALSO WILL BE SOME- AUTOMATION COSTS TO MAKE ADJUSTMENTS TO THE SYSTEM SYSTEM NECESSARY TO TRACK- FOLKS PROGRESS AS THEY DO TRAININGS AS WELL AS ISSUES STIPENDS- AS THE COMPLETE THOSE ACTIVITIES. SO HOPEFULLY THAT PROVIDES YOU A LITTLE MORE INSIGHT INTO INTO THAT AREA. AND THEN THE FINAL QUESTION WAS IN REGARDS TO THE BACKUP PROVIDER SYSTEM AND THE AND WHETHER AND TO USE LIMITING IT TO SEVERELY IMPAIRED RECIPIENTS- I APOLOGIZE FOR ANY CONFUSION IT IT IS NOT INTENDED TO ONLY SERVES SERVICE SEVERELY IMPAIRED CERTAINLY SEVERELY ARE IMPAIRED ARE REFERENCED BECAUSE WE ANTICIPATE. THAT THOSE WILL BE THE INDIVIDUALS THAT WILL MOST LIKELY BE IN A SITUATION THAT WILL REQUIRE- THIS TYPE OF BACKUP CARE BUT WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT IS SITUATIONS WHERE A PROVIDER NEEDS IMMEDIATE SERVICES THEIR PROVIDER ISN'T AVAILABLE AND WITHOUT THOSE SERVICES THEY WOULD BE PUT IN A SITUATION OF HAVING A HEALTH OR SAFETY RISK. AND SO IT THAT IS REALLY THAT CRITERIA FOR BEING ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE THOSE SERVICES HOPEFULLY THAT PROVIDE SOME CLARIFICATION AND HOPE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS ON ANY OF THESE AREAS. AND JUST FOR THE RECORD I WILL TELL I WILL SAY FOR DOCTOR PAN WHO JUST REJOINED US ONE OF THE ISSUES WAS THE 7% WERE THEY GONNA VOTE REPEAL THAT AND THEY JUST RELEASED TODAY THAT THAT THAT IS ON THE LIST OF THINGS TO BE REPEALED. OKAY DEPARTMENT FINANCE. NONCONFORMITY FINANCING FROM A GROUP OF THIS TIME. AT THE PAR VALUE. THANK YOU PROCEED WITH THE LIST OF ANALYST OFFICE AGAIN- PER DIRECTION FROM THE SUBCOMMITTEE OF JUST IDENTIFYING AREAS IN WHICH THERE IS OR IS NOT ALIGNMENT WITH LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES- ONE AREA WHERE THERE IS A LINE MEANT WITH UP AND- AND ACTION THAT'S THE SENATE TOOK LAST WEEK WAS NOT ONLY TO ELIMINATES THE I JUST CITED BY THE SUSPENSION AROUND THE RESTORATION OF I. JUST A SERVICE HOURS BUT THEN ALSO TO REMOVE. AND STATUTORY LANGUAGE THAT REFERENCES THE ORIGINAL REDUCTION TO BEGIN WITH AND AGAIN THE TRAILER BILL WAS JUST POSTED TODAY AND WILL MAKE SURE TO REVIEW IT THOROUGHLY BUT JUST AN INITIAL WALK IT DOES SEEM TO REPEAL THOSE KEY SECTIONS I WILL PROVIDE MORE UPDATES AS WE DO A MORE THOROUGH REVIEW- ON THAT POINT- BUT ONE ISSUE THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO RAISE TWO IN TERMS OF- LEGISLATIVE CONSIDERATION- REVOLVES AROUND THE LONG TERM CARE OF CAREER PATHWAYS PROPOSAL. AND JUST FOR ADDITIONAL CONTACTS AND THE CONCEPT OF PROVIDING TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES FOR I JUST AS PROVIDERS AND STRENGTHENING PROP POSSIBLE LINKS BETWEEN THE I JUST WORK FORCE AND THE BROADER HOME HEALTH WORKFORCE- WAS RAISED- DURING THE MASTER PLAN FOR AGING STAKEHOLDER PROCESS BUT THEN ALSO IS BROADLY MENTIONED WITHIN THE MASTER PLAN FOR AGING GET- ITSELF. SO DEEPLY WHILE THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSAL MAY TRY TO GET A BROADER CONCEPT I THINK AT THIS TIME- WE DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE THE INFORMATION TO REALLY ASSESS THE MERITS OF THE PROPOSALS ALONG THOSE LINES I'M SPECIFICALLY WE DON'T KNOW- HOW THE ADMINISTRATION CAME UP WITH THE TWO HUNDRED MILLION DLLARS BAKER HOW MANY I JUST AS PROVIDERS WILL BE SERVED- WHAT WHAT TO THE MIX OF TRAINING PROGRAMS AND WHAT AND WHETHER IT THAT'S GONNA- IS REALLY ADDRESSING. THE PROBLEM OR UNMET NEED WITHIN THE SYSTEM AND AGAIN MORE BROADLY WHAT IS THE PROBLEM MORE UNMET. NEED THAT THIS PROPOSAL IS TRYING TO A DR AND HOW WHAT'S IT WILL IT. BE MEASURED. AND AGAIN WE'RE STILL IN THE EARLY STAGE OF MAIN. SO WE WILL CAN TO WORK WITH THE- AND I'M TO GET THESE ADDITIONAL DETAILS I'M HOWEVER IF THE NECESSARY LEVEL OF DETAIL CANNOT BE PROVIDED WITHIN THE SHORT BUDGET TIME FRAME TO THE LEGISLATURE. WE CAN ALSO HELP THE LEGISLATURE THINK THROUGH POSSIBLE ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES IF IT WERE INTERESTED IN DOING SOMETHING IN THIS SPACE- POSSIBLY COMING UP WITH A MORE DEFINED. AND ACTIONABLE SHORT TERM APPROACH- WHICH MAY NOT REQUIRE AS MUCH FUNDING TO BEGIN WITH BUT CAN AT LEAST BE BUILT UPON PERHAPS NEXT YEAR OR IN THE FUTURE YEARS AT THE ADMINISTRATION SOLIDIFIES AND COMPLETES. THAT MORE LONGER TERM STRATEGY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU AT IN MS JOHNSON CAN YOU CAN SOMEBODY SPEAK TO THE CAREER PATHWAYS AND WHAT WHAT IS THE GOAL WHAT DO YOU HOPE TO ACHIEVE IN AND WHERE. WILL WHERE WILL FOLKS BE GOING IS THE DEPARTMENT CAN OFFER SOME TRAINING ARE THEYGONNA HAVE TO OBTAIN IT. AT A COMMUNITY COLLEGE OR OR SOMEWHERE ELSE- AND THEN I GUESS. THEN THE PEOPLE'S THE PAY CORRESPOND WITH THEIR THEIR NAME THE NEW LEVEL OF TRAINING BUT BUT I THINK THE OVERALL QUESTION IS. HOW DOES THIS FIT INTO THE- MASTER PLAN ON AGING AND WHAT DO YOU HOPE TO ACHIEVE WITH THAT. TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS WHAT WILL. THIS ABSOLUTELY IS COMING OUT OF. THOSE DISCUSSIONS IN THE MASTER PLAN FOR AGING AND THE OVERALL CONCERN THAT AS WE ALL ARE VERY AWARE THAT. POPULATION IS AGING MORE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO NEED. OUR DIRECT KINDS OF CARE- AS WE- MOVE THROUGH THE NEXT DECADE THAT WAS COULD THAT WILL CONTINUE TO INCREASE AND SO THERE IS. GOING TO BE A TREMENDOUS DEMANDED THAT WE ALREADY ARE STRUGGLING TO MEET. BOTH WITHIN I'D JUST ASK AND THE HEALTHCARE FIELD AND CARE- FIELD. GENERALLY SO IT IS INTENDED TO- YOU START ADDRESSING THOSE NEEDS BY STARTING TO. PROVIDE THAT OPPORTUNITY TO INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE ALREADY- IN THAT IT DOING THAT AS- PART OF THEIR INCOME WHETHER IT'S SOMETHING THAT THEY DO FOR FAMILY MEMBERS OR WHETHER IT'S SOMETHING THEY DO AS THEIR PRIMARY OCCUPATION. THEY ARE DOING THAT CARE GIVING AND- AND THAT IS A GOOD PLACE TO START IN DOING OUTREACH TO TRY AND OFFER OPPORTUNITIES. TO GROW SKILLS AND TO MOVE INTO THAT FIELD ONE THING THAT HAS HAPPENED IN THE ICE THOSE PROGRAMS IS THAT MORE AND MORE PEOPLE WITH MORE- BUT CHALLENGING DISABILITIES ARE ABLE NOW TO BE IN THEIR HOMES AND BE SERVED IN THAT WAY BUT IN ORDER TO DO THAT WE NEED TO HAVE PEOPLE THAT HAVE THE SKILL LEVELS. TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THAT TYPE OF CARE AND SO GIVING OPPORTUNITIES TO. GET PEOPLE TRAINING AND EXPAND THEIR SKILLS IS CRITICAL TO MEETING THAT WORK FORCE DEMAND AND THAT'S THE INTENT HERE WE WOULD INTEND TO HAVE A VENDOR THAT WOULD PROVIDE TO CONTRACT WITH THE VENDORS TO PROVIDE- THE TYPE OF THE TRAINING WHAT THAT EXACTLY IS GOING TO LOOK BACK. LOOK LIKE IS STILL IN DEVELOPMENT BUT CERTAINLY- THAT WOULD BE OFFERING BOTH- VIRTUAL AS WELL AS IN PERSON TRAINING WE KNOW FROM- PAST. THE AROUND PROVIDING TRAINING THAT MANY PEOPLE WHO ARE DOING IN HOME CARE IT'S DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO GET OUT BECAUSE THERE THAN LEAVING THE INDIVIDUALS THAT THEY CARE FOR. AND SO BEING ABLE TO DO THAT RIGHT THAT KIND OF TRAINING REMOTELY IS CERTAINLY AN AREA THAT WE'RE EXPLORING AND INTEND TO PURSUE WITH HOW WE HOW WE WILL APPROACH THIS. WE HAVE BEEN TALKING WITH OUR HOW IT WORKS- FOLKS WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT AND- OPPORTUNITIES THAT THEY'VE ALREADY BEEN OFFERING TO THOSE FOLKS THAT THEY SERVE. AND APPROACHES THAT WE FEEL LIKE COULD ALSO BENEFIT- ARE PROVIDERS IN IN. IN TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES SO THAT SOME OF THAT DIRECTION AND WHEN IT'S COMING OUT OF. OKAY M. THE VERY VERY NEEDED ALL OF IT OF COURSE- THANK I THINK IT JUST ALWAYS BEARS MENTIONING THAT OUR CHILD CARE WORKERS IN OUR SENIOR CARE WORKERS ARE SOME OF THE LOWEST PAID IN OUR WORK FORCE WHICH DOESN'T SAY GOOD THINGS ABOUT US. BLACK PANTS. THANK YOU- AND- AGAIN REALLY APPRECIATE THE ADMINISTRATION- FINALLY ADDRESSING THE SUSPENSION- AND- IT IS A SAID. HAVING BEEN THROUGH SOME TOUGH BUDGET TIMES RECOGNIZE THAT SOMETIMES WE HAVE TO MAKE HARD DECISIONS BUT WE SHOULD PUT AUTOMATIC CUTS AND REALLY APPRECIATE THE- THE MINISTRATION THE GOVERNOR'S. RECOGNITION THAT IN THIS PROPOSAL AND ALSO THE SIXTY FIVE. THIRTY FIVE COUNTY SHARING RATIO- BECAUSE NOT ONLY IS THAT- PLATE NOT REVERSING THAT CHANGING THAT RATIO- THAT NOT ONLY DOES THAT. THE DECREASE DEPRESSION HSS. THOSE FUNDS BECAUSE NINE ONE REALIGNMENT ALSO FLOW DOWN TO BOTH MENTAL HEALTH AND- PUBLIC HEALTH TWO MAJOR PRIORITIES I KNOW AS WELL FOR THE ADMINISTRATION WE JUST TALKED ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS JUST EARLIER THIS HEARING AS WELL. SO AGAIN REALLY IMPORTANT AND VITIATE THE ACTION BY THE ADMINISTRATION. AT THE WOULD MAKE NOTE THAT- CERTAINLY HOPING THAT WE CAN FIND SOME SOLUTIONS TO ENSURE THAT THERE ARE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS WITH EVERY COUNTY AND THAT- DATE THAT THOSE DON'T GET DRAGGED OUT- SO BUT- AGAIN HOPE LOOK LOOKING AT LOOKING TO WORKING WITH THE ADMINISTRATION ON TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN. RESOLVE THAT ISSUE AS WELL BUT- YEAH AND FREESHEET- THESE VERY IMPORTANT STEPS THAT I KNOW THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT FOR A VERY LONG TIME. IN THE SUB COMMITTEE- AND- YEP WE SHOULD. THE GOVERNOR PUTTING THIS FOR THANKS. THANK YOU MUCH LET'S MOVE ON TO ISSUE SIX. CHILDREN AND FAMILY SERVICES. DID YOU FELT AGAIN CENTURY I WITH THE DEPARTMENT- THAT THERE ARE NUMBER OF THE BEST THINGS THAT I WILL M. HIGHLIGHT HERE FOR YOU AND THEN I AM I WILL INVITE OUR DEPUTY DIRECTOR INTO SPORTS TO SPEAK TO SOME OF THE MORE SPECIFIC QUESTIONS THAT WERE IN YOUR AGENDA. SO FOR THE ITEMS I WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT IN THE MAY REVISION THAT ARE KEY INVESTMENTS IN THE SAFETY AND WELL BEING OF CHILDREN AND YOUTH IN FOSTER CARE AND THOSE WERE AT RISK OF ABUSE OR NEGLECT- I'D LIKE TO BEGIN WITH A HUNDRED AND FORTY NINE MILLION DOLLARS THAT IS THE THREE YEAR BLOCK GRANTS. TO SUPPORT COUNTIES IN THEIR IMPLEMENTATION OF PREVENTION- UNDER THAT FAMILIES FIRST PREVENTION SERVICES ACT WHICH USUALLY ALLOWS OPPORTUNITIES FOR FEDERAL. FUNDING FOR PREVENTION PURPOSES. YOU NEED TO THERE ARE FORTY MILLION DOLLARS TO MEET THE NEEDS OF FOSTER YOUTH WITH A CUTE AND COMPLEX CARE NEEDS. INCLUDING YOUR TO RETURN FROM OUT OF STATE GROUP HOME PLACEMENTS- IN. TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE. THERE IS ALSO FIVE MILLION DOLLARS WHICH SUPPORTS THE ON GOING WORKLOAD ASSOCIATED WITH THE CHILD AND ADOLESCENT NEEDS ASSESSMENT TOOL OR WHAT WE OFTEN REFER TO AS CANS. AND ALONG WITH SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS RELATED TO THE CONTINUUM OF CARE REFORM AND RECONCILIATION RELATED TO X. ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENDITURES AND THE COST SHARING BETWEEN THE STATE AND COUNTIES- ADDITIONALLY I WOULD VIOLATE THAT WE HAVE INCLUDING FUNDING TO CONTINUE ALLOWING FOR PLACEMENT PRIOR TO APPROVAL. TO ENSURE THAT WE HAD IN SUPPORT AND URGENCY SUPPORT FOR CARE GIVERS. AND FINALLY I WOULD HIGHLIGHT THAT WE HAVE INVESTED- OR PROPOSED TO INVEST FOUR MILLION DOLLARS IN ONE TIME FUNDING AVAILABLE OVER THREE YEARS. TO PROVIDE STIPENDS AND SCHOLARSHIPS TO. NATIVE AMERICAN STUDENTS WHO ARE PURSUING THEIR MASTERS IN SOCIAL WORK DEGREES YOU'RE PRACTICING PUBLIC CHILD WELFARE. WITH THAT I WILL HAND IT TO OUR DEPUTY DIRECTOR INTEREST. WELCOME A SHORT SAID AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR UP THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON- YOU SHORT BE DIRECTOR OF THE CHILDREN AND FAMILY SERVICES DIVISION AFTER THE FLUTE. QUESTION FROM THE AGENDA THERE WERE A COUPLE RELATED TO THE PROPOSAL TO ADDRESS THE COMPLEX NEEDS AND YOU TO ENABLE THEM TO BE SUPPORTED. BUT IN CALIFORNIA THE QUESTION FOR WHETHER THE FUNDING IS INTENDED TO BE ONE TIME OUR ON GOING AND WHETHER WE ARE PLANNING TO REVIEW THE CASE. THANK YOU THAT WERE PLACED OUT OF STATE CONFORM. HOW THAT PROPOSED SPENDING IS UTILIZED. TOTAL INCLUDED A COMPANY OF ONE TIME YEAH I'M GOING FUND AND ARE INVOLVED. IN THE IN THE YEAH PROPER THING. I'M INCOME THE INITIAL INTERNAL ANALYSIS THAT WE DID REGARDING THE CIRCUMSTANCES. OF THE YEARS THAT WERE RETURNED TO CALIFORNIA. HAVE ANY FORM THE PROPOSAL TO ADDRESS BOTH THAT DEVELOPMENT EXPANSION AND SPECIALIZED PROGRAMS WHICH WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED IN THE ONE TIME FUNDING. AS WELL AS THE NEED FOR THE ON GOING FUNDING TO SUPPORT THE INTENT THAT NEED. TO ADD YOUR CALL COMPLEXITY. IT WOULD ALSO. ABOUT THE- RELATED TO FUNDING TO SUPPORT PLACEMENT PRIOR TO A FAMILY APPROVAL AT THE RESORT THE ONLY. THE QUESTION POSED WAS WHETHER THE FUNDING ONLY FOR BUDGET YEAR AND THAT IS CORRECT. THE PROPOSAL IS TO ALLOW THE FUNDING TO CONTINUE FOR A HUNDRED AND TWENTY DAYS FOR GOOD CAUSE TO EXPAND UP TO THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE DAYS FOR BUDGET YEAR AND THEN BEGINNING IN FISCAL YEAR TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE. EMERGENCY CARE GIVER FUNDING WOULD BE LIMITED TO NINETY DAYS. I BELIEVE THOSE ARE THE ONLY QUESTION POSED IN THE AGENDA HAPPY TO ANSWER ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS. OR PROVIDE FURTHER CLARIFICATION. THANK YOU DEPARTMENT OF. ANYTHING STRATIS DOESN'T FOR HIS PART FINANCE ADDED YET AGAIN NOTICED A COMMENTS AT THIS TIME BUT OPENED- RESPONDED ANY QUESTIONS SHORT EARLIER. THANK YOU ANGELES SHORT WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE- BUT THE START AUSTIN MILLER TO WHAT MY- LA- COLLEAGUES HAVE NOTED WITH PREVIOUS ITEMS WERE CONTINUING TO REVIEW- THE DETAIL PROPOSAL INFORMATION- FOR THE VARIOUS MAYOR VISION PROPOSALS. AND WE WELL- REFINER COMMENTS AND PROVIDE ANY ADDITONAL GUIDANCE THE LEGISLATURE OVER THE COMING DAYS AND WEEKS BUT FOR TODAY THERE ARE- A FEW POINTS WE WANTED TO JUST FLAG FOR THE SUBCOMMITTEE'S ATTENTION- IN PARTICULAR GIVEN LINKAGES TO ISSUES THAT THE SUB COMMITTEE HAS DISCUSSED DURING PREVIOUS HEARINGS. ALSO FOR THE MAYOR VISON PROPOSES- A ONE TIME GENERAL FUND ALLOCATION OF A HUNDRED TWENTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS TO ASSIST TOWN TO THE DEVELOPING PREVENTION SERVICES IN LINE WITH AFFECT YES- CHIEF DEPUTY. DIRECTOR TRANSPORT TO THIS PROPOSAL. AND AT THE TIME OF THE GENERATOR BY KNOWS LEVEL AND- WOULD PROPOSE FOR THE- IN OUR OFFICE HAD FLAG THIS IS AN AREA FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER PROVIDING FUNDING FOR COUNTIES TO HELP INSURE- BUT ALL ELIGIBLE YOUTH AND FAMILIES. ACROSS THE STATE WOULD BE ABLE TO ACCESS PREVENTION SERVICES. AND WHILE WE HAVE NOT YET BEEN ABLE TO REVIEW ALL THE DETAILS OF THIS PROPOSAL IT DOES SEEM TO MAKE PROGRESS WITH THIS RECOMMENDATION- AND THIS IS ALSO AN ISSUE THAT THE SUBCOMMITTEE DISCUSSED AT LAST WEEK'S HEARING. SECOND MAYOR VISION CONTINUES SOME SIGNIFICANT AUGMENTATION. RELATED TO PANDEMIC RESPONSE WITHIN CHILD WELFARE. INCLUDING FUNDING FOR THINGS SUCH AS FLEXIBILITY AS AN EXPANSION FOR NON MINOR DEPENDENTS AND FORMER FOSTER YOUTH- AS WELL AS SUPPORT FOR FAMILY RESOURCE CENTERS TECHNOLOGY HOTLINE FOR YOUTH AND FAMILIES AND MORE. BUT ONE NOTE WE WOULD MAKE IS THAT- EIGHT GAP DOES REMAIN- IN TERMS OF FINDING IT- FOR. RESOURCE FAMILIES S. T. R. T. P. AND- LANCASTER TERRORISTS IN GENERAL. WE RESERVE THE TIME OF THE JANUARY GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THAT OVER THE COURSE OF THE PANDEMIC THESE CAREGIVERS AND FAMILIES. HAVE BEEN FACING INCREASED COST PRESSURES SUCH AS FOR FOOD AND HAVE BEEN NAVIGATING THE VARIOUS CHALLENGES A STAY AT HOME ORDERS- FOR EXAMPLE CHALLENGES AROUND VIRTUAL LEARNING. AND POTENTIALLY LACK OF ACCESS TO CHILD CARE. AND THEREFORE WE CONTINUE TO FLAG THAT THE LEGISLATURE MAY WISH TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE FOR- OR OTHER DIRECT ASSISTANCE. TO ALL FOSTER CARE PROVIDERS AS PART OF THE STATE'S OVERALL COOK AT NINETEEN FISCAL RELIEF. EFFORTS WITHIN CHILD WELFARE- THE THIRD REGARDING THE PROPOSED- TO ASSIST COUNTIES OF DEVELOPING AND IMPLEMENTING SPECIALIZED PLACEMENT OPTIONS AND SERVICES FOR USE WITH COMPLEX CARE NEEDS- THAT WILL BE TAKING A LOOK A CLOSER LOOK AT THIS PROPOSAL IN THE COMING DAYS. WE JUST WANT TO FLY GET GIVEN UNDER SUB COMMITTEE HAS DISCUSSED IN THE PAST THE POTENTIAL NEED FOR ONGOING SUPPORT FOR YOUTH RETURNING FROM OUT OF STATE- AND BROADER QUESTIONS AROUND THE USE OF OUT OF STATE CONGREGATE CARE PLACEMENTS- MORE BROADLY GOING FORWARD. AT THE WILL FOLLOW UP WITH COMMITTEE STAFF AS WE LEARN MORE ABOUT THE PROPOSAL. AND LASTLY- JUST WANTED TO FLAG THAT- THE MAYOR VISION AND THAT DOES- REMOVE SUSPENSION LANGUAGE FOR CHILD WELFARE PROGRAMS THAT HAD BEEN INCLUDED AT THE TIME OF THE- JANUARY GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. AND OTHER SUB COMMITTEE TOOK ACTION LAST WEEK VOTING TO ELIMINATE ALL PROGRAM SUSPENSION SO MAYOR VISION IS IN ALIGNMENT- WITH THE LEGISLATURE ON THAT POINT- THAT'S ALL I HAVE AT THE MOMENT BUT HAPPY TO HELP ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AND I WOULD I WOULD AGREE WITH THE ISSUE OF- FUNDING FOLLOWING THAT THE CHILD AND IF FIVE OUT OF ONE PLACEMENTS NEED SOMETHING EVEN IF THEY'RE NOT A FAMILY PROVIDER. IT SEEMS TO MAKE SENSE TO BE ABLE TO. PROVIDE FOR THAT THAT CHILD IN THAT HOME AS WELL AS- AS ANOTHER MEANS OF STABILIZING THAT PLACEMENT. BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT THE MORE PLACEMENTS THE HIGHER RISK THAT KIDS ARE UNDER WHEN THEY'RE IN THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM- SO THAT THAT SEEMS TO MAKE THEM GOOD SENSE- AND- ARE WE ARE WE GOING TO BE SURE THAT WHEN WE START ACCEPTING OUR KIDS BACK. OF THIS TO THE DEPARTMENT THAT WE ARE GOING TO BE PREPARED- TO HAVE ALL OF THEIR NEEDS MET- AND ADDITIONALLY AS I UNDERSTAND IT THERE'S NOTHING THAT WOULD PREVENT US FROM SENDING KIDS OUT OF STATE AGAIN. DO WE NEED LEGISLATION THAT WOULD ACTUALLY PROHIBIT US. FROM SENDING KIDS OUT OF STATE- AND THEREBY REALLY ENSURING THAT THE STATE BE ABLE TO STEP UP. OR NOT THAT'S THE MYSTERY AMISSAH SHORTS. TRANSACTION IN TERMS OF ARE WE GOING TO BE ABLE TO SERVE THEM WHEAT RETURNING FUNDED IN THIRTY THREE YEARS THAT WILL REQUIRE MORE PLACE OUT OF STATE TO CALIFORNIA AND WE ARE- WHAT WE RETURNED OF HIS TO MANY TO. PLACEMENT RELATIVES TEST YOUR TO KEEP PEACE AND THE FOSTER FAMILY HOMES- WE PROVIDE A VERY INTENSIVE. TA IN ORDER TO DEVELOP AN INNOVATIVE MODELS AND FELL AGAIN THAT PROPOSAL THAT WE HAVE BEFORE YOU IT SORT OF BASED ON ON WHAT WAS SUCCESSFUL AND WHAT'S NEEDED TO CONTINUE TO EXPAND- IN ORDER TO CONTINUE TO THIRTEEN I THE NEEDS OF YOUR CURFEW COMPLEX GAME BUT IN CALIFORNIA. AND ARE PROPOSAL DOES NOTINCLUDE A MORATORIUM ON PLACES BUT PLATE OUT OF STATE- BUT WE DO THINK THAT THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN TO ALLOW THEM TO BE FAIR. SUCCESSFULLY WITH IN CALIFORNIA. OKAY SO THEY HAVE BEEN THERE THE KIDS ARE SUCCESS AND WE HAVE A VALUE. AT OUR LOW AT AT ALL OF THIS HOW HOW WE'RE MEASURING SUCCESS IT IS STABLE PLACEMENT. WHAT CONTINUING TO MONITOR THIS ON AN ONGOING BASIS FOR LOOKING AT IT- ON A WEEKLY BASIS TO CONTINUE TO POST INFORMATION ABOUT WHERE THE PLACEMENT BAR OF THE YOUNG PEOPLE CONTINUE TO DO THAT AND THE TECHNICAL. I'M WITH THE COUNTY YOU CAN TROUBLESHOOT ISSUES AS THEY ARISE HELLO. AND EVEN THOUGH THE YOU'D HAVE RETURNED TO CALIFORNIA WE CONTINUE TO BE VERY INTENSELY INVOLVED WITH MAKING SURE- THAT WE KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH THAT YOU KNOW WE'RE DRAFTING NEEDS IF THEY ARE. OKAY THANK YOU AND THEN MY FINAL QUESTION IS. AROUND THE EXTENSION. OR FOR BEING ABLE TO DO FAMILY PAYMENTS FOR CARE GIVERS- BUT WE'RE STILL NOT HITTING THAT NINETY DAY AND IT'S BEEN A HUNDRED TWENTY DAYS DO WE NEED TO CHANGE THE CRITERIA OR WE'RE GONNA HIRE MORE STAFF OR HOW WE CAN MAKE. MAKE SURE THAT WE MEET THAT. AT NINETY DAY ED. THE DEADLINE. ASSEMBLY FOR THE PANDEMIC- THE TIME ONE HAD COME DOWN SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE BEGINNING EVERY FIRST DALY APPROVAL AND QUARTER FOR TWENTY NINETEEN AVERAGES WERE DOWN TO A HUNDRED AND EIGHT DAYS BUT THEN THEY FOUND OUT THAT THE RESULT OF THAT HAND THAT MIGHT AND THEN QUARTER FOR TWENTY TWENTY WITHOUT A HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE DAYS BUT WE DO THINK THAT WE WERE IN A VERY POSITIVE TRAJECTORY TO GET TO THAT NINETY DAY TIMELINE WE JUST HADN'T HAD. A BIT OF A PICK UP WITH THAT AND I'M MAKING A LOT OF THE BACKLOG THAT RESULTED AT THEIR FEET DUE TO THE PANDEMIC SAID WE DO THINK THAT WILL BE ABLE TO GET THE TIMELINE BACK DOWN- BUT OVER THE COURSE OF THE NEXT. YEAR AS WE RETURN- AND A STEP ISSUE HER. HEAVY REQUESTED MORE SO. AND THAT THE PART TO BE ABLE TO MEET THAT BACKLOG. THEY'RE ALREADY GOING DOWN AND IT'S REALLY AT THE COUNTY LEVEL IN TERMS THAT THAT REFER FAMILY APPROVAL BY DONE- AT THE COUNTY LEVEL BUT- YOU KNOW I THINK THE BACKLOG THAT RESULTED WAS MORE IN TERMS OF. YOU KNOW DELAYS BECAUSE EVERYTHING WAS MOVED INTO A VIRTUAL WORLD AND THERE WERE SOME DELAYS IN TERMS OF BEING ABLE TO DO THAT I'M INSPECTION. THANKS TO HELP- BUT BUT THE BACKLOG THAT TIME LINES ARE ALREADY COMING BACK DOWN- I DON'T HAVE THE CURRENT DATA RIGHT. IN FRONT OF ME BUT I CAN GET THAT FOR YOU. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH ALL RIGHT LET'S MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER SEVEN IMMIGRANT AND INTEGRATION SERVICES. HI GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR- MY NAME IS MARCELLO RUIZ AND I AM THE DIRECTOR OF THE OFFICE OF EQUITY- WITH CDSS WHICH INCLUDES THE IMMIGRANT INTEGRATION BRANCH- A PROVIDE A VERY BRIEF AT THE OF THE PROPOSED INVESTMENTS AND THEN OF COURSE LEAVE TIME FOR. FOR QUESTIONS- SO THE PROPOSED IMMIGRANT INTEGRATION INVESTMENT BUILT ON THE STATE'S SUCCESSFUL EFFORTS OF SUPPORTING CALIFORNIANS THROUGH IMMIGRATION LEGAL SERVICES AND ALSO INTEGRATION SERVICES THAT INCLUDE NAVIGATION KEYS MANAGEMENT- FOR IMMIGRANT CHILDREN AND YOUTH AND THEIR FAMILIES- THE PROPOSAL ALSO INCLUDES FUNDING TO SUPPORT MIGRANT ARRIVALS AT THE BORDER AS WELL AS CRITICAL SERVICES FOR IMMIGRANTS DURING TIMES. OF NEED BY AUGMENTING THE RAPID RESPONSE FUNDS AS YOU KNOW THAT DEPARTMENT ADMINISTERS FUNDING FOR IMMIGRATION LEGAL SERVICES AND SINCE TWENTY FIFTEEN WE HAVE FUNDED NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS TO PROVIDE THOSE LEGAL SERVICES THROUGHOUT. THROUGHOUT THE STATE SO INDIVIDUALS CAN REGULARIZE THEIR STATUS WHICH WE ALL KNOW IS REALLY CRITICAL TO ECONOMIC MOBILITY AND OVERALL WELL BEING OF INDIVIDUALS AND THEIR FAMILIES- THE FIRST PROPOSAL SPEAK TO IS THE TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT FOR DACA AND NATURALIZATION FILING FEES. A COMPONENT OF THE IMMIGRATION LEGAL SERVICES PROGRAM HAS BEEN TO SUPPORT FILING FEES FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE APPLYING FOR DACA AS THERE IS NO- AVAILABILITY TO WAIVE THOSE FEES THE USCIS IS NOT PROVIDE THAT PROCESS SINCE TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE PARKS DEPARTMENT HUSBANDS PROVIDING THAT SUPPORT. AND WE HAVE SERVED OVER THIRTEEN THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS WITH THOSE FILING FEES THIS PROPOSAL WILL SEEK TO EXPAND THAT SERVICE TO ALSO INCLUDE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE SEEKING TO NATURALIZE THEIR STATUS. THE SECOND PROPOSAL IS IN HOGG. OF THE- FOR I COME MINORS AS WE ALL KNOW WE ARE EXPERIENCING A SURGE IN ARRIVALS OF UNACCOMPANIED MINORS AND MANY OF THOSE ABOUT IT ABOUT 90% OF THE UNACCOMPANIED MINORS WHO COME INTO THE UNITED STATES ARE ULTIMATELY PLACED IN. IN CALIFORNIA THROUGH THE TWENTY MILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT IN SERVICES FOR UNACCOMPANIED MINORS WERE SEEKING TO AUGMENT THE LEGAL SERVICES THAT ARE PROVIDED TO THE CHILDREN AND YOUTH. AS WELL AS SERVICES THROUGH A PROGRAM NAMED OPPORTUNITIES FOR USE THAT INCLUDES CASE MANAGEMENT PROGRAM NAVIGATION USE MENTORING AND COACHING AND FAMILY SUPPORT- FAMILY SUPPORTS WITH THE GOALS OF SUPPORTING HEALTHY AND RESPONSIVE RELATIONSHIPS FOR THE YOUTH AND THEIR FAMILIES. HELP BUILD USE CORE SKILLS AS WELL AS CONNECTING THE USE AND THEIR FAMILIES TO COMMUNITY RESOURCES- THE LAST TWO COMPONENTS OF THE PROPOSAL ARE IN EIGHT MILLION DOLLAR ALLOCATION- TO PROVIDE SHELTERING SERVICES TO THE ARRIVING. MIGRANTS AS AS AS YOU WELL KNOW WE HAVE SEEN AN INCREASE IN MIGRANT ARRIVALS AT THE SOUTHERN BORDER ACROSS THREE COUNTIES IMPERIAL RIVERSIDE AND SAN DIEGO AND THERE HAS BEEN AN EIGHT MILLION DOLLAR- ALLOCATION THREE TRIO FUNDS. TO THE SUPPORT- RESPITE SHELTERS FOR MIGRANTS WHO ARE MAINLY MOVING ON AND TO INSURE THAT WE ARE RESPONDING IN AN APPROPRIATE WAY TO- INSURE THE SAFETY AND WELL BEING OF THE ARRIVING MIGRANTS BUT ALSO THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITY PARTICULARLY WITH ALL OF THE CONCERNS SURROUNDING CO BID. AND THEN FINALLY- THAT BUDGET ALSO PROPOSES A ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR AUGMENTATION FOR THE RAPID RESPONSE FUND THIS. FUND IS USED TO PER RIDE AS- CRITIC SERVICE DURING TIMES OF NEED AND IN THE PAST HAS BEEN USED TO PROVIDE SUPPORT DURING AND AFTER WILDFIRES- THE DISASTER RELIEF ASSISTANCE FOR IMMIGRANTS WAS SUPPORTED IN PART WITH THIS FUND- AS ECONOMIC RELIEF FOR- FOR COVE IT AND HAS ALSO BEEN USED TO SUPPORT THE BORDER RESPONSE IT'S REALLY A FUND THAT'S AVAILABLE TO SUPPORT. IMMIGRANTS AND RECOGNITION THAT MANY ARE EXCLUDED FROM FEDERAL SERVICES THAT ARE NECESSARY DURING THOSE CRITICAL TIMES OF NEED- SO WITH THAT I WILL- A CLATTER I'M GLAD TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. NANKANA DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE NO FURTHER QUESTIONS AT THIS TIME MISSPELLED. HELLO WITH L. A. L. NOTING THAT WILL BE WOKING WITH THE ADMINISTRATION TO UNDERSTAND REALLY THAT THE NETWORK AND THE AND THE CAPACITY TO GET THE ADDITIONAL FUNDS OUT AND MAKING SURE THAT WE UNDERSTAND THE ESTIMATE- THAT IS ASSOCIATED WITH THEIR- ALL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THEN- AND I WOULD CONCUR THIS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT ISSUE THAT I THINK IS VERY TIMELY IN ITS AND RIGHT IN FRONT OF US RIGHT NOW AND- WE NEED TO DEAL WITH IT BUT WE JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT THE- RESOURCES ARE- ARE WELL SPENT. WITH GOOD WITH GOOD CHECKS AND BALANCES SO WE'LL BE TALKING A LOT MORE ABOUT THIS MOVING FORWARD AND WE THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK- OKAY NOW WE ARE GOING TO MOVE ON TO THE NEXT SECTION WHICH- IS. CHILD CARE. THANK YOU SIR- AND I WILL KEEP A STOCK FOR THE CHILD CARE ITEM GENTRAN WITH THE DEPARTMENT ONE MORE TIME AND- WITH RESPECT TO CHILD CARE AND WE HAVE QUITE A BIT OF FUNDING WITHIN THE MAY REVISION IN INVESTMENT. IN RELIEF FOR THE WORK FORCE WHICH WILL TALK ABOUT IN THE NEXT AGENDA ITEM. AS WELL AS THOSE INVESTMENTS TO IMPROVE ACCESS AND TO STRENGTHEN INFRASTRUCTURE AND MAKE SOME SYSTEMS IMPROVEMENTS- FEDERAL FUNDING IS GOING TO CONTINUE TO BE INSTRUMENTAL IN PROVIDING FOR THE RECOVERY AND STABILITY OF. THE WORK FORCE AND THE FAMILIES. AND THE PROGRAMS THAT SERVE THEM- THE ADMINISTRATION WILL CONTINUE THROUGH THESE PROPOSALS AND IN OUR IN OUR WORK I HAD AND TO BUILD A KEY RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE MASTER. I DON'T CARE SYSTEM. AND AS WE DISCUSSED IN PRIOR HEARINGS WE ARE FULLY COMMITTED TO A SUCCESSFUL TRANSITION OF CHILD CARE PROGRAMS FROM CD ETS EDS ASKED. WHICH WILL BE EFFECTIVE JULY ONE IS AROUND THE CORNER BEFORE WE KNOW IT- SO WITH RESPECT TO THE MAY REVISION ONE OF THE-MOST SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IT'S REALLY HISTORIC. IN PROPOSING TO ADD MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND CHILD CARE SLOTS. TO THE SUBSIDIZED CHILD CARE SYSTEM- THOSE SLOTS AT QUITE A FEW OF THEM ARE IN THE ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT PROGRAM WITH ABOUT YOUR PROGRAM AND SOME ARE ALSO PROVIDEDIN THE GENERAL CHILD CARE PROGRAM. WHICH ALLOWS US TO DO A LITTLE BIT MORE TARGETING AND IN PARTICULAR TO INVEST SOME IN- ACCESS FOR INFANTS AND TODDLERS WHICH IS DEEPLY NEEDED IN THE FIELD. IN ADDITION TO THE SLOTS- DO FOR IN. IN- IN. AND TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IN INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS. WE ALSO PROPOSED TEN MILLION DOLLARS IN FEDERAL FUNDS TO INVEST IN LOCAL RESOURCE AND REFERRAL AGENCIES. SIX MILLION DOLLARS WHICH WILL MODERNIZE OUR PAYMENT SYSTEM AND ENSURE THAT WE CAN UTILIZE DIRECT DEPOSIT PAYMENTS FOR CONTRACTORS. FIVE MILLION DOLLARS TO- SUPPORT BE- IN PLANNING AND INITIAL IMPLEMENTATION FOR THE DESIGN OF A CHILD CARE DATA SYSTEM TO MEET THE NEEDS OF FAMILIES AND THE WORK FORCE. TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS WHICH WILL PRESERVE FLEXIBILITY BACK CONTRACTORS CURRENTLY HAVE TO TRANSFER FUNDS BETWEEN GENERAL CHILD CARE IN STATE SCHOOL PROGRAM AS A LOAN. AND TO ALLOW FOR THAT FLEXIBILITY TO BE RECONCILED ON THE BACK AND BY THE STATE. AND DIDN'T TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS IN ONE TIME FEDERAL FUNDING FOR A MULTI YEAR EFFORT FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES TO EXAMINE AND STRNGTH AND OUR QUALITY SUPPORT AND SYSTEM- YOUR AGENDA ASKS ABOUT THE MIX THE FUNDING FOR CHILD CARE SLOTS. AND THE CHILD CARE SLOTS THAT ARE FUNDED WITH FEDERAL FUNDING FEDERAL RELIEF FUNDING UNDER ARAFAT. AND THAT IS AB THE LARGEST AMOUNTS AND THEN THERE IS ADDITIONALLY- SOME GENERAL FUND AND SOME PROPOSITION SIXTY FOUR FUNDING. THE NTENTION IS FOR THE SLOT TO BE I'M GOING WITHOUT YOUR- SOURCES STILL TO BE DETERMINED- AND I THINK WITH THAT I WILL- ALLOW MY COLLEAGUES JUMP INTO SELINA CHOW WILL ANSWER- SO ADDITIONAL. THAT WERE IN THE AND BACK. THANK YOU VERY. MISTER AGAINST OUR CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER WITH THE DEPARTMENT IN THE ENGENDERING A QUESTION REGARDING THE DIRECT DEPOSIT AND WHEN THAT WOULD START WE ARE INTERESTED. OUR STAR TO TURN AND RIGHT TWENTY TWO AND THE SORT OF OUR TIME THE DEPARTMENT TO CONTACT WITH THE VENDOR I. HE DIDN'T RESPOND. FROM AND OTHER REQUIRE. AS WELL COURTNEY WITH SCO TO OPERATE. ANOTHER POSITS. ARE WE ARE CLEANING TO- IN REBEKAH. COMMUNITY TO. THE TERM WHAT KIND- ONE OPTED THE DIRECT ABOUT WOULD ALLOW TIME TO DO THAT. GEISHAS WELL. AND IN THE CHUNKIER DID SYSTEM I SEE THAT YOU HAVE A ON. HOW THE SYSTEM WILL LINE THE SHOW CARE DATE EFFORTS SEEK. WOULD BE THE FOLKS. THAT WOULD. PROVIDE A FUTURE. FOR INTERFACING WITH THE OTHER SYSTEM SUCH AS HE SAID CRADLED CAREER. ON SO THIS WAY IT GIVE US NOW TO. EVENTUALLY IN DATA OTHER SYSTEMS FOR CALM. DATING AND ANALYSIS. THIS IS CURRENTLY THE GROUNDWORK. FUTURE UP. AND YOUR ENGAGING WITH C. YEAR PROCESS WHILE. RIGHT TERMS OF THE FUNCTION. THIS IS A DAY SYSTEM VISION BACK. WE PROPOSING THAT OF BECOME TWO THINGS FOR ONE AND CENTRAL ALL THE ACROSS THE PROGRAMS- INTO A UNITS. MANAGEMENT WOULD STAY OVER. FOR A TOOL THAT WOULD HELP MANAGE SCHEDULING CAPACITY IN WOMAN'S ATTENDANCE SHEETS INVOICES ALL OF THOSE THINGS THAT NOT ALL PROVIDERS CURRENTLY HAVE BEEN AUTOMATED TOOL TO MANAGE SO IT'S REALLY TO FALL AND- HAVING THE FUNCTIONALITY TO ALLOW FOR DATA COLLECTION OF WHAT ITS CURRENT REQUIRE CURRENTLY REQUIRED AS WELL AS THIS TYPE OF EXTENSION WE ALSO ENVISION THAT THIS OUR SYSTEM WOULD ALLOW FOR. MANAGING AS WELL. AND THEN. REGARDING COSTS THE STUDENT VISION- WILL BE INFORMED BY AN EXTENSIVE STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT PROCESS AS WELL AS PLANNING SO IT IS SUBJECT. STATES I. T. PROJECT APPROVAL PROCESS AND THAT'S REQUIREMENTS- AND SO WE'RE WE'RE THINKING IT IS GOING TO BE. AN EIGHTEEN MONTH PROCESS TO GET THROUGH. ALL THAT PLANNING AND PROCUREMENT- IT IS EIGHT A DOCTOR WILL SCALABLE SOLUTIONS SO THAT DIFFERENCE IN COST WITH HER NEARLY DRIVEN BY THE VOLUME OF USER LICENSES THAT WE WOULD NEED FOR THE TECHNOLOGY SOLUTION. THERE IS- I REQUEST THAT AS WE GET THROUGH THE APPROVAL PROCESS WOULD HAVE PROVISIONAL AUTHORITY FOR ANOTHER FOUR MILLION TO EXPAND. THE USER LICENSES. AND SO WE DON'T A COMPLETE ESTIMATE OF COSTS OF THIS TIME BUT IT IS- IN THE MAIL OF. THE TENDS NOT AS OPPOSED TO HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS THAT WE WOULD SEE WITH TRADITIONAL MORE COMPLEX. SYSTEMS THAT REQUIRE A LOT OF CUSTOMISATION AND HERE WE HAVE- WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING IS MORE OF A OFF THE SHELVES AT THE SOLUTION. IS A MUCH LOWER COST. AND THEN WHAT AND BELIEVE WE'RE NOT QUITE URE ON. YEAH HOW ABOUT TIMELINE FOR IMPLEMENTATION I HEARD EIGHTEEN MONTHS FOR. THE PROCESS TO GET A VENDOR AND POTENTIALLY THAT DESIGN. HOW ABOUT FOR IMPLEMENTATION TO HAVE A TIME LINE FOR THAT. RIGHT SO- ONCE WE GET THROUGH THE PROCUREMENT IMPLEMENTATION WOULD BE RELATIVELY QUICK AND IT'S REALLY JUST A MATTER OF. HOW WHY DO WE WANT TO. EXTEND THAT FOR THAT THE- DIFFERENT LICENSES AND USERS ONCE IT. USE THE SYSTEM. SO WE CAN FIND OUT A LITTLE MORE BUT IT WILL BE VERY MUCH INFORMED BY. THE STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT PROCESS. OKAY GOD DEPARTMENT FINANCE. AFTERNOON CARLOS A LETTER AT THE PERMANENT FINANCE THING FURTHER TO ADD- LOOK FORWARD TO FUTURE DISCUSSIONS THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISS CORTES. AFTERNOON SERVER TED WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE SO WE DO HAVE A FEW COMMENTS AS FAR UNDERSTANDING- OF THE CHANNEL CARE ME REVISION PACKAGE- AND WE KNOW THAT OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THIS PACKAGE MAY OF ALL AS BUDGET DOCUMENTS CONTINUE TO BECOME AVAILABLE FOR OUR REVIEW. FOR FIRST COMMENT IS WITH ABOUT THE ARC OF FUNDED SLOTS THE AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN FUNDED SPOT SO MOST OF THE ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND SLOTS ABOUT SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND OF THOSE ARE FUNDED. WITH A ONE TIME. AND WHICH WE ESTIMATE ON THE NUMBER OF SLOTS THAT THESE ARE THE FUNDS LASSEN. TWENTY JUNE THREE. ONLY RECOMMEND ALL TO APPROACH STAFFERS STEPHENS THE WORST TEMPORARY SLOTS BUT OVER A LONGER PERIOD. SO FIRST WE RECOMMEND EXTENDING THE TEMPORARY SLOTS THAT WERE FUNDED OVER THE COURSE OF THE PANDEMIC- THESE ARE CURRENTLY SET TO EXPIRE JUNE THIRTIETH TWENTY TWENTY TWO. WE RECOMMEND EXTENDING THE SLOTS UNTIL JUNE THIRTIETH OF TWENTY TWENTY FOUR. WE ESTIMATE THIS ACTION WOULD COST TWO HUNDRED AND NINETY FOUR MILLION. WITH THE REMAINDER OF THE FUNDS THE STATE COULD PROVIDE AN ADDITIONAL DOCTOR SLOTS- UNTIL JUNE THIRTIETH OF TWENTY TWENTY FOUR. WE RECOMMEND VOUCHER SOCKS INSTEAD OF GENERAL CHILD CARE SLOTS BECAUSE OF THE TEMPORARY NATURE OF THE FUNDS FIRST. AND ULTRA PROVIDERS ARE ABLE TO BEGIN USING SOCKS MUCH QUICKER THAN GENERAL CHILD CHILD CARE PROVIDERS- BECAUSE OF THE STATE CONTRACTING. PROCESS WHEN WE ASKED THE STATE WOULD BE ABLE TO ABOUT FOURTH. SLOTS IMAGE LOWER THAN THE SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND- FROM OCT. TO TWENTY AND TO REJECT OF TWENTY TWENTY FOUR. OUR RECOMMENDED APPROACH AVOIDS DESTROYING FAMILIES FROM CHILD CARE INVOLVED JUNE OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO AND JUNE IN TWENTY TWENTY THREE- WHEN THE TEMPORARY SLOTS ARE SET TO EXPIRE. ON AVAILABILITY OF FUNDS- BUT IT DOES PUSH TO. YOU KNOW A HUNDRED AND THIRTY TWO MILLION OF AN ONGOING RESOURCE BY JULY TWENTY TWENTY THREE. WITH REGARD TO THE GENERAL FUND IN PROPOSITION SIXTY FOUR HUNDRED SLOTS THE LEGISLATURE MADE WANT TO CONSIDER A TOLD BY MY- THE MIX OF. EXPANSION OF GOING TO EACH OF PER. THE GOVERNOR'S- PROVIDE ROUGHLY SIXTY OF THE SLOT EXPANDING DR PROGRAM WITH THE REMAINING 4% ON THE GENERAL CHILD CARE KERR. THE LEGISLATURE MAY WANT TO CONSIDER ALL MAKES SLAPSTICK- I WHICH FROM BEST ME YOUR- FOR THE- IF LEGISLATURE TO CREATE MORE TIME- IMMEDIATELY INCREASING ACT TO TRY. THE MOTORCYCLE BE THE SOCKS THEY WANT. TO BECAUSE IT JUST HE TYPICALLY TO NINE TO RE UP CHEN CHILD SLOTS YOU TO THE STATE CONTRACT PROCESS ONLY A FEW MONTHS TO UP THE SAW. THE CONTRACTING PROCESS. IN MY LAST COMMENT IS ABOUT THE PROPOSED- INFRASTRUCTURE GRANT ON THE TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION AMERICA FUND PROPOSED FOR THE INFRASTRUCTURE GRANT- SO WE KNOW THAT OUR BUDGET HEALTHCARE FUNDS CANNOT BE USED FOR. CONSTRUCTION MAJOR INNOVATION LAND PURCHASE FOR LEAD TO IMPROVEMENT MINOR RENOVATIONS SUCH AS INSTALLING THEN YOU'RE A NEW H. BACK OR SMOKE DETECTORS IN ALLOW POLICE DEPARTMENT FUNDS. GIVEN THESE RESTRICTIONS- EITHER THE SCHOOL THE PROPOSAL WILL NEED TO BE SIGNIFICANTLY MODIFIED TO EXCLUDE ACQUISITION CONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT. OR THE PROPOSAL WE NEED TO BE FUNDED WITH JAVA THIS CONCLUDES MY REMARKS BUT I'M HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF A TRADE YOU HAVE A RESPONSE TO STRETCHING THAT OUT TO TWENTY TWENTY FOUR VERSUS TWENTY TWENTY TWO. WELCOME HI SORRY I SWITCHING DEVICES HERE AT THE TECHNICAL DIFFICULTY TYPICALLY YOU CAN DIFFERENT BACKGROUNDS. AND WITH RESPECT TO THE SLOTS ARE PROPOSAL IS AM ALTERNATIVE CLASS AND 40% OF THEM TO BE- GENERAL CHILD CARE WITH A FEW SMALLER AT PROGRAM INVESTMENTS AS WELL. WE BELIEVE THAT THESE FLIGHTS COULD BE TAKEN UP IN IN IN THE TIME FRAMES THAT WE HAVE PROPOSED A FREEZE THEM IN AND ARE ARE COMFORTABLE WITH THE FULL INVESTMENT AND COMMITTED FULLY TO ALL ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND SECTION ONE HUNDRED SIX THOUSAND SLOTS. AND THAT IS THE APPROACH SAID THAT WE WOULD CONTINUE TO PROPOSE OKAY. OKAY AND THEN THEN CAN YOU KNOW THAT THE ARE BILL BACK PROBABLY PLAN HAS TWO HUNDRED FLIGHTS AS DOES THE LEGISLATIVE WOMEN'S CAUCUS- HAS TWO HUNDRED SLOT SAID THAT THAT WE THINK ARE NEEDED- AND ALSO AND TELL ME ABOUT THE DECISION NOT TO DO ANYTHING WITH RATE REFORM WE'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT RATE REFORM IN OUR CHILD CARE PROVIDERS. YOU TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT. SURE AND HAPPY TO WE SIMILARLY HAVE HEARD FROM QUITE A FEW. FOLKS WITH RESPECT TO RATES AND WE DO APPRECIATE THE IMPORTANCE EVERY. WITHIN THE CHILD CARE SYSTEM I'M BAD THE MASTER PLAN CONVERSATIONS ON RATE- AND MANY STAKEHOLDER INPUT AND WE HAVE RECEIVED AS WELL. AND WE ARE CONTINUING TO TAKE A VERY CLOSE MARK- AT THE RATE SYSTEM AT THE STRUCTURE AND THAT THE RATES THEMSELVES. AND AS YOU ADD CRAP. BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT THEIR STATUTORY FRAMEWORK WITH RESPECT TO- BARGAINING WITH THE CHILD CARE PROVIDERS UNITED. UNITED UNION AND INCLUDES RATE SETTING WITHIN THE SCOPE OF BARGAINING SO AS WE- CONTINUE TO TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT RATES- AND TO IMPLEMENT THAT STATUTES AND WE CERTAINLY DO LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU FURTHER. ON THOSE ISSUES. OKAY THANK YOU I'M SOME ITEMS WILL HAVE A LOT MORE CONVERSATIONS I'M SURE ABOUT- TELL KAREN T. K. AND THE PROPOSALS BEFORE US MOVING FORWARD OKAY AND YOU'VE LOST ALL OF THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS BUT ME SO WE WILL MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER NINE- CHILDCARE PANDEMIC RELIEF. GREAT WITH RESPECT TO FOCUSING ON ACADEMIC RELEASED- THE BEST IN THE MAY REVISION- THERE'S A TOTAL OF MORE THAN FOUR POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS IN FEDERAL FUNDING THAT'S BEING PROVIDED TO CALIFORNIA BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. WE HAVE UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY TWO OR TWENTY TWENTY THREE DEPENDING ON THE FUNDS SOURCE TO OBLIGATE THOSE FUNDS AND THEN ONE ADDITIONAL YEAR TO YEAR EXPAND BAM- THERE WAS ALREADY SOME ACTION TAKEN- IN IN PRIOR BUDGET ACTIONS TO PROVIDE RELIEF TO THE FIELD IN AN EFFORT TO STABILIZE WHAT WE KNOW HAS BEEN A DEVASTATING AND DIFFICULT TIME. FOR PROVIDERS AND FOR CHILDREN AND FAMILIES ACROSS THE STATE. AND THE MAY REVISION PROPOSES ADDITIONAL RELIEF EFFORTS- AND THESE ARE- INVESTMENTS THAT THAT WERE- AN AGREEMENT THAT WAS REACHED WITH THE CHILD CARE PROVIDERS UNITED UNION THROUGH A WORK GROUP PROCESS FOR PANDEMIC RELIEF. SO I WILL HIGHLIGHT BED BEES INCLUDE INVESTMENTS IN ONE TIME STIPENDS FOR ALL LICENSED. FAMILY CHILD CARE HOME PROVIDERS HAVE THIRTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS IN ADDITION TO TIERED STIPENDS FOR LICENSE CENTERS THAT RANGE FROM. THREE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED TO SIX THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS. BASED ON LICENSED. CHILD CAPACITY- TWO HUNDRED SIX NO DOLLARS FOR ONE TIME PROVIDER STIPENDS OF SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR SUBSIDIZED CHILD. IT ALSO INCLUDES THE WAIVER OF FAMILY FEES FOR ALL FAMILIES THROUGH THE END OF JUNE TWENTY TWENTY TWO. ANY REVISION INCLUDES AS WELL AND INVESTMENT IN THE CHILD CARE INITIATIVE PROJECTS TO BUILD CAPACITY BEFORE IN THE TIGER AND OTHER SLOTS AND- TO ASSIST US IN LICENSING AND PROVIDERS WITHIN CHILD CARE DESERT. THE MAY REVISION ALSO INCLUDES AN INVESTMENT IN BE CALIFORNIA INCLUSION AND BEHAVIOR CONSULTATION SERVICES TO INCLUDE SUPPORT FOR THE CHILD CARE WORKFORCE IN MEETING THE NEEDS OF CHILDREN- AND TAKING CARE OF THEMSELVES. IT INCLUDES AS WELL SIXTEEN ADDITIONAL PAID NON OPERATIONAL DAYS FOR KOBE NINETEEN RELATED CLOSURES AND THE CONTINUATION OF A HOLD HARMLESS POLICY THAT PAYS CONTRACTED PROVIDERS BASED ON THE MAXIMUM LEVEL AND NEED- YOUR AGENDA ASKS A QUESTION WITH RESPECT TO THE AMOUNT OF FEDERAL SPENDING THAT REMAINS- I'M ALLOCATED. SINCE AS I INDICATED NOT ALL FEDERAL FUNDS NEED TO BE- OBLIGATED AND LIQUIDATED IMMEDIATELY- IT- MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THERE IS ONE POINT ONE EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS THAT IS NOT YET ALLOCATED IN RESPONSE TO YOUR QUESTION- IN THE PROPOSALS THAT YOU HAVE BEFORE YOU. THE ANSWER ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- MISS CORTES. HELLO AGAIN CORTES AT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE- SO AGAIN WE JUST LIKE TICK ME OUT MY COMMENTS WITH RESPECT- WORST ARE UNDERSTANDING OF THE BUDGET PROPOSALS ARE EVOLVING AS WE CONTINUE TO PREVIEW MORE DOCUMENTS BASED ON OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE REVISION FAILED TO INCLUDE A PROPOSAL TO FULLY EXPANDED TWO POINT THREE BILLION OF CHILD CARE STABILIZATION OF FUNDING. SO THAT WITH THIS HEALTHCARE STABILISATION FUNDING PROVIDED THROUGH THE STATE IS TO PROVIDE GRANTS TO CHILD CARE PROVIDERS TO KEEP COSTS SUCH AS PAYROLL RENT AND CLEANING SUPPLIES SO CHILDCARE STABILIZATION FUNDS TOTALING TWO POINT THREE BILLION MUST BE FULLY EXPENDED BY SEPTEMBER THIRTIETH TWENTY TWENTY THREE HOWEVER THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT STRONGLY ENCOURAGES STATES TO EXPAND AT LEAST HALF OF THE FUNDS BY DECEMBER ELEVENTH OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE AS CONGRESSIONAL INTENT IS THAT THESE RESOURCES BE USED FOR BUYING MEDIA FISCAL RELIEF TO THE CHILD CARE SECTOR. AND THIS INCLUDES HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS THAT ARE NOT PARTICIPATING IN THE SUBSIDIZED TO STOP THE STATE IS TO DEVELOP AN APPLICATION AND AWARDS OF GRANTS WHICH HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS BASED ON THEIR OPERATING EXPENSES. I'M HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS. OKAY THANK YOU. MISTER YOU WANT TO SPEAK TO THE ABOUT WHAT PLAN IS ALL THOSE MY OUT. I'M YES I CAN CERTAINLY CONFIRM FOR YOU THAT WE ARE.

OKAY THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH ALL RIGHT- A LOT TO DO IN THIS SPACE AND DID YOU DID YOU ANSWER THE QUESTION ABOUT ABOUT JUST. REGULAR PARENTS WHO HAVE KIDS WHO ARE GENERALLY IN CHILD CARE- WOULD COULD THEY BE WERE THE RECIPIENTS OF SOME OF THOSE FUNDS THAT NEEDS TO GET OUT THE DOOR AS THEY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SEND THEIR KIDS BACK IN. BUT I'VE HAD SOME OF THE SAME NEEDS OF SOME OF OUR PROVIDERS. I'M pPROVIDE. PROPOSING HERE IS REALLY MORE ABOUT- IT IS REALLY MORE ABOUT RELIEF TO THE FIELD IN A STABILIZATION OF THE FIELD WHICH ULTIMATELY OF COURSE BENEFITS PARENTS- THERE ARE OBVIOUSLY A NUMBER OF OTHER PROPOSALS THAT ARE ARE MORE ABOUT WOODS AND BENEFITING PARENTS IN TERMS OF THEIR OWN ECONOMIC STABILITY SOME OF THEM THAT WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER TODAY.

OH NINE BUDGET CUTS AND TODAY I WISH TO EMPHASIZE A FEW SPECIFICS- ABOUT THE PROGRAM THE MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING WITH THE SS REQUIRES THAT A VEHICLE TRANSPORTATION COSTS AND SIGNIFICANT LIABILITY A PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE SIX INSURANCE BE PART OF EACH OF THE THIRTY SIX SITES PROGRAMS IN ORDER TO. ACCOMPANY CLIENTS FOR SERVICES. IT REQUIREMENTS THE JUSTIFICATION FOR ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO ENSURE THE CAL WORKS BY THE PROGRAM CAN PROVIDE SERVICES TO THE AMERICAN INDIAN COMMUNITIES. THIRTY SIX I AGENCIES WERE AWARDED FUNDING TO PURCHASE ONE VEHICLE PEAKS NEAR THE INCEPTION OF THE PROGRAM IT IS LIKELY THAT THESE VEHICLES ARE NO LONGER USED TO PULL. CLINIC STAFF SERVING PEOPLE OF RURAL AREAS CAN FACE WINTER ROAD CONDITIONS THAT ARE DANGEROUS TO TROOPERS. SO RELIABLE VEHICLE IS ESSENTIAL ADDITIONAL FUNDING WOULD ALLOW FOR THE FOR THE LEASING A CAR. ALSO THE LIMITED AMMO USED FUNDS DO NOT ALLOW FOR THE CLINIC TO TAKE IN ANY INDIRECT COSTS OR BENEFITS FOR THE POSITION. THEY CAN ONLY COVER THE SALARY UNDER THE EXISTING IN MY VIEW. THE LACK OF ANY COST OF LIVING INCREASES IN THE LAST TWENTY YEARS HAS RESULTED IN CAL WORKSITE THE STAFF NEEDING TO. MOVE ON AND ALSO RESULTS IN THE DIFFICULTY OF REPLACING THEM AT THE CLINIC. ONE EXAMPLE IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN WAS THE PROGRAM COORDINATOR. POSITION COULD NOT BE FILLED FOR ABOUT FIVE MONTHS PARTLY DUE TO LIMITED FUNDING. DUE TO TIME CONSTRAINTS STATED THE PRIOR MANAGER ADDING MORE FUNDING WOULD ALLOW FOR SUFFICIENT TIME TO BE ALLOCATED.
