00:42:48.032 --> 00:42:48.933
THAT IT BE DONE IN AN

00:42:48.999 --> 00:42:50.901
ECOLOGICALLY RESPONSIBLE MANNER

00:42:50.968 --> 00:42:52.536
AND I THINK THAT WE'VE ALL

00:42:52.603 --> 00:42:53.938
AGREED ON THAT WE MAY HAVE A

00:42:54.004 --> 00:42:55.239
LITTLE DIFFERENCE IN WHAT.

00:42:55.306 --> 00:42:56.740
OF OPINION WHAT THAT MEANS BUT

00:42:56.807 --> 00:42:58.275
AGAIN I THINK THE SPIRIT OF OUR

00:42:58.342 --> 00:42:59.944
DISCUSSIONS HAS BEEN YOU KNOW WE

00:43:00.010 --> 00:43:01.745
RECOGNIZE THE CLEAR CUTTING IS

00:43:01.812 --> 00:43:02.913
NOT THE ANSWER ME NEVER GONNA

00:43:02.980 --> 00:43:04.748
CUT DOWN A HUNDRED AND TWENTY

00:43:04.815 --> 00:43:07.017
NINE MILLION DEAD TREES --

00:43:07.084 --> 00:43:09.286
WE DON'T WANNA BLAST ROADS EVERY

00:43:09.353 --> 00:43:11.221
NOOK AND CRANNY THAT --

00:43:11.288 --> 00:43:13.223
WE RESPECT AND APPRECIATE THAT

00:43:13.290 --> 00:43:14.625
THERE IS A PLACE FOR OUR

00:43:14.692 --> 00:43:16.393
WILDLIFE --

00:43:16.460 --> 00:43:18.429
IN A NEED TO TO HAVE THAT KIND

00:43:18.495 --> 00:43:19.697
OF ECOLOGICAL BALANCE SO I

00:43:19.763 --> 00:43:21.365
APPRECIATE THAT I KNOW IS WE GO

00:43:21.432 --> 00:43:23.667
FORWARD A WE WILL CONTINUE TO

00:43:23.734 --> 00:43:25.402
TRY TO MAINTAIN THAT BALANCE.

00:43:25.469 --> 00:43:27.504
AND THE OTHER THING --

00:43:27.571 --> 00:43:29.406
THAT I I DID WANT TO ASK BECAUSE

00:43:29.473 --> 00:43:31.041
I WASN'T CLEAR.

00:43:31.108 --> 00:43:32.376
IS WHETHER THE LEVEL OF

00:43:32.443 --> 00:43:35.145
INVESTMENT IN OUR GRID HARDENING.

00:43:35.212 --> 00:43:36.313
BY -- ARE

00:43:36.380 --> 00:43:38.282
I'LL USE WILL BE CONSIDERED

00:43:38.349 --> 00:43:41.118
DURING THE CPUC REASONABLENESS

00:43:41.185 --> 00:43:42.753
REVIEW.

00:43:42.820 --> 00:43:43.787
BECAUSE I THINK THAT.

00:43:43.854 --> 00:43:46.256
I IS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HAS --

00:43:46.323 --> 00:43:49.560
BEEN A PRIMARY CONCERN IS THE

00:43:49.626 --> 00:43:51.261
HARDENING OF THIS INFRASTRUCTURE

00:43:51.328 --> 00:43:53.263
AND RECOGNIZING THAT THE CAR FAR

00:43:53.330 --> 00:43:54.398
IN SOME OF THESE OTHER FARMERS

00:43:54.465 --> 00:43:55.699
WERE NOT.

00:43:55.766 --> 00:43:58.068
THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE AYE

00:43:58.135 --> 00:44:00.537
YOU USED WE KNOW THAT THE FIRES

00:44:00.604 --> 00:44:02.439
UP IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA HAVE

00:44:02.506 --> 00:44:03.841
ALREADY BEEN DETERMINED TO HAVE.

00:44:03.907 --> 00:44:05.909
HAD THAT COMPONENTS AND I WOULD

00:44:05.976 --> 00:44:07.978
SUBMIT THAT THE THOMAS FIRE --

00:44:08.045 --> 00:44:08.846
THAT -- WHO

00:44:08.912 --> 00:44:10.447
WAS SO DEVASTATING AND

00:44:10.514 --> 00:44:12.883
DESTRUCTIVE FROM MY DISTRICT --

00:44:12.950 --> 00:44:14.952
UNDOUBTEDLY HAS THAT COMPONENT

00:44:15.019 --> 00:44:17.087
AS WELL SO.

00:44:17.154 --> 00:44:18.522
THIS IS A A A MASSIVE

00:44:18.589 --> 00:44:20.057
UNDERTAKING FOR A MASSIVE

00:44:20.124 --> 00:44:21.191
PROBLEM AND I REALLY DO

00:44:21.258 --> 00:44:23.027
APPRECIATE THAT THE FACT THAT WE

00:44:23.093 --> 00:44:24.895

TOGETHER WANT TO THANK OUR

00:44:25.529 --> 00:44:27.398
CHAIRS AND COLLEAGUES FROM A

BOTH HOUSES IN BOTH.

00:44:29.066 --> 00:44:31.368
ASIDE TO THE EYE OF THAT WE ARE.

00:44:31.435 --> 00:44:32.269
I THINK REALLY ARE MAKING GREAT

00:44:32.336 --> 00:44:34.505
PROGRESS IS STILL.

00:44:34.571 --> 00:44:36.673
AND AGAIN I HOPE WE KEEP IN MIND

00:44:36.740 --> 00:44:38.075
THAT OF WHAT MIGHT BE GOOD FOR

00:44:38.142 --> 00:44:39.777
THE GOOSE IS NOT NECESSARILY

00:44:39.843 --> 00:44:41.111
GOOD FOR THE GANDER.

00:44:41.178 --> 00:44:42.946

PASSED AND SIGNED THIS YEAR I

00:44:48.919 --> 00:44:50.220
THINK THAT IS.

00:44:50.287 --> 00:44:52.156
AN URGENCY THAT WE HAVE IN --

00:44:52.222 --> 00:44:53.490
ARE WORKING TOWARDS CHAU AGAIN I

00:44:53.557 --> 00:44:54.825

00:44:54.892 --> 00:44:56.160
EFFORTS.

00:44:56.226 --> 00:44:57.628
PREVENTION AND SAFETY THOSE WHO

00:44:57.694 --> 00:45:00.130
ARE TRULY THE KEYS.

00:45:00.197 --> 00:45:00.731
THANK YOU SENATOR SEMI MEMBER

00:45:00.798 --> 00:45:02.199
GALLON [inaudible]

THAT'S THANK YOU CHAIRS FIRST

00:45:06.804 --> 00:45:08.672
LIE BACK ON THE SENATORS OF MY

00:45:08.739 --> 00:45:10.674
COLLEAGUES THAT TERM.

00:45:10.741 --> 00:45:12.309
THIS IS BEEN A OF A LOT OF

00:45:12.376 --> 00:45:14.845
HEARINGS A LOT OF STUFFS A

00:45:14.912 --> 00:45:17.114
HAPPEN AND GREAT PEOPLE TO WORK

00:45:17.181 --> 00:45:18.182
WITH APPEARANCE WHERE WE'RE FACE

00:45:18.248 --> 00:45:19.216
WAS A BIG CHALLENGE BUT I WANT

00:45:19.283 --> 00:45:21.885
TO JUST KINDA RE COOP --

00:45:21.952 --> 00:45:23.854
WHAT HAS HAPPENED OVER THE?

00:45:23.921 --> 00:45:25.522
LAST MEETINGS IN WHEREAS SO WE

00:45:25.589 --> 00:45:26.824
BASICALLY HAVE TAKEN IN VERSE

00:45:26.890 --> 00:45:28.492
OFF THE TABLE.

00:45:28.559 --> 00:45:30.494
SO THAT NEEDS TO BE STATED.

00:45:30.561 --> 00:45:31.962
SO THAT'S OFF THE TABLE.

00:45:32.029 --> 00:45:33.831
WE'RE LEFT WITH.

00:45:33.897 --> 00:45:36.100
THE OPTIONS OF IN IN MY MIND YOU

00:45:36.166 --> 00:45:37.134
CAN CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG IF

00:45:37.201 --> 00:45:39.269
WE DO NOTHING.

00:45:39.336 --> 00:45:41.038
UTILITIES WILL BE DOWNGRADED THE

00:45:41.105 --> 00:45:42.473
RATEPAYERS WILL PICK UP THAT

00:45:42.539 --> 00:45:45.776
COST WHEN THEY GO TO THE PC.

00:45:45.843 --> 00:45:47.945
IF THEY GO INTO BANKRUPTCY THE

00:45:48.011 --> 00:45:48.812
RATEPAYERS ATTACK OF THE COST OF

00:45:48.879 --> 00:45:51.014
THE JUDGE WILL BE DECIDING.

00:45:51.081 --> 00:45:52.616
HOW WE GO FURTHER INTO CHAPTER

00:45:52.683 --> 00:45:53.717
ELEVEN SO WORTH THE NUMBER THREE

00:45:53.784 --> 00:45:55.719
OPTION WHICH IS?

00:45:55.786 --> 00:45:57.554
IN MY MIND WE WANNA MAKE SURE

00:45:57.621 --> 00:45:58.789
THAT THE INVESTORS PAY THEIR

00:45:58.856 --> 00:46:00.224
FAIR SHARE.

00:46:00.290 --> 00:46:01.258
DOWN TO WHERE THE U. CHARLIE IS

00:46:01.325 --> 00:46:02.025
STILL [inaudible]

00:46:02.092 --> 00:46:03.760
SOLVENT.

00:46:03.827 --> 00:46:05.496
AND CAN STILL BORROW MONEY AT

00:46:05.562 --> 00:46:07.331
THE RIGHT RATES AND THAT LESSENS

00:46:07.397 --> 00:46:10.701
THE IMPACT ON THE RATE PAYERS.

00:46:10.767 --> 00:46:12.503
AND I THINK THE FOURTH ISSUE

00:46:12.569 --> 00:46:13.770
WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT.

00:46:13.837 --> 00:46:15.973
IS VERY CRITICAL TO THIS.

00:46:16.039 --> 00:46:17.474
OPTION IS THAT WE ACTUALLY DO

00:46:17.541 --> 00:46:19.209
SOMETHING ABOUT THE SHAPE THAT

00:46:19.276 --> 00:46:20.277
WE HAVE FOR VEGETATION AND

00:46:20.344 --> 00:46:21.979
CALIFORNIA.

00:46:22.045 --> 00:46:23.213
AS OF THAT AND THAT OPTION

00:46:23.280 --> 00:46:25.215
ACTUALLY HELPS EVERYBODY IT

00:46:25.282 --> 00:46:27.417
HELPS THE THAT NINE OTHER FIRES

00:46:27.484 --> 00:46:29.153
THAT ARE STARTED BY.

00:46:29.219 --> 00:46:31.388
THE TRANSMISSION LINE.

00:46:31.455 --> 00:46:33.257
WHICH THAT DRIVES DOWN THE RATES

00:46:33.323 --> 00:46:35.159
FOR INSURANCE FOR YOUR HOME.

00:46:35.225 --> 00:46:37.961
IT HELPS FIREFIGHTING COST.

00:46:38.028 --> 00:46:39.696
IT HELPS THEM.

00:46:39.763 --> 00:46:41.465
THE RATE PAYERS.

00:46:41.532 --> 00:46:44.234
ALL THOSE THINGS HELP.

00:46:44.301 --> 00:46:45.636
EVERYBODY CALIFORNIA NOT JUST

00:46:45.702 --> 00:46:47.838
THE RATE PAYER OR THE I USE SO I

00:46:47.905 --> 00:46:49.840
WANT TO SHARE THAT TOWN.

00:46:49.907 --> 00:46:51.642
WE HAVE TO WE HAVE THREE

00:46:51.708 --> 00:46:52.509
DIFFERENT TYPES OF VEGGIES FOR

00:46:52.576 --> 00:46:54.011
THE MOST PART THREE DIFFERENT

00:46:54.077 --> 00:46:55.012
TYPES OF VEGETATION IN

00:46:55.078 --> 00:46:56.547
CALIFORNIA.

00:46:56.613 --> 00:46:58.415
WE HAVE FORESTED LANDS.

00:46:58.482 --> 00:47:01.251
WHICH IS A BIG PART OF SENATOR

00:47:01.318 --> 00:47:03.020
WOOD AND MY EYES DISTRICT AND

00:47:03.086 --> 00:47:04.154
THEN WE HAVE.

00:47:04.221 --> 00:47:05.389
THE OAK WOODLANDS I CALLED FOR

00:47:05.455 --> 00:47:06.590
LACK OF A BETTER TERM WHICH IS

00:47:06.657 --> 00:47:07.791
THAT INTERFACE BETWEEN THE

00:47:07.858 --> 00:47:08.759
FOREST.

00:47:08.825 --> 00:47:10.694
AND THE VALLEY'S.

00:47:10.761 --> 00:47:12.095
WHERE THERE'S LOTS OF GRASS AND

00:47:12.162 --> 00:47:13.931
BRUSH AND THEN WE HAVE THE

00:47:13.997 --> 00:47:15.899
COASTAL REGIONS WHICH IS?

00:47:15.966 --> 00:47:17.668
PRIMARILY AFTER THE NORTH IT'S

00:47:17.734 --> 00:47:19.670
REDWOODS BUT IF YOU'RE IN THE

00:47:19.736 --> 00:47:20.571
SOUTH IT CHAPARRAL [inaudible]

00:47:20.637 --> 00:47:22.839
SO.

00:47:22.906 --> 00:47:24.541
IN FORESTRY WE HAVE SOME VALUE

00:47:24.608 --> 00:47:25.409
IN [inaudible]

00:47:25.475 --> 00:47:28.378
THE PRODUCT THAT COMES OUT THERE

00:47:28.445 --> 00:47:30.347
WITHIN IT WHEN WE GET TO THE

00:47:30.414 --> 00:47:31.715
OTHER TWO PIECES OF PIE.

00:47:31.782 --> 00:47:33.283
LIKE MY GOOD SENATOR HAS THERE

00:47:33.350 --> 00:47:35.552
IS NO VALUE IN [inaudible]

00:47:35.619 --> 00:47:37.421
BRUSH.

00:47:37.487 --> 00:47:39.389
AND SO WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT

00:47:39.456 --> 00:47:42.192
WE FIND.

00:47:42.259 --> 00:47:43.794
THE VEGETATION MANAGEMENT PART

00:47:43.860 --> 00:47:46.363
SO THAT SHE IS ABLE TO USE THAT

00:47:46.430 --> 00:47:48.098
EQUIPMENT TO KEEP THAT BRUSH

00:47:48.165 --> 00:47:50.067
DOWN TO A A LEVEL WHERE IT STILL

00:47:50.133 --> 00:47:52.035
THERE.

00:47:52.102 --> 00:47:53.003
BECAUSE IT NEEDS TO BE THERE

00:47:53.070 --> 00:47:54.104
BECAUSE WHEN IT RAINS IT HOLDS

00:47:54.171 --> 00:47:56.273
THE SLOPES IN PLACE.

00:47:56.340 --> 00:47:57.441
BUT WE ALSO NEED IT DOWN TO THE

00:47:57.507 --> 00:47:59.009
LEVEL WHERE WE DON'T HAVE IT.

00:47:59.076 --> 00:48:00.777
AT A FLAME HEIGHT OF TWENTY FEET

00:48:00.844 --> 00:48:02.446
WE NEED THAT FLAME MIGHT AT LESS

00:48:02.512 --> 00:48:04.214
THAN. TWENTY INCHES.

00:48:04.281 --> 00:48:06.116
SO THOSE ARE THE THINGS WE TALK

00:48:06.183 --> 00:48:08.151
ABOUT VEGETATION MANAGEMENT IN

00:48:08.218 --> 00:48:10.020
CALIFORNIA.

00:48:10.087 --> 00:48:11.121
HOW WE MANAGE THOSE ARE ALL

00:48:11.188 --> 00:48:12.656
DIFFERENT TOOLS IN THE IN THE

00:48:12.723 --> 00:48:14.458
OAK WOODLANDS GRAZING IS A GREAT

00:48:14.524 --> 00:48:16.293
TOOL AND WE NEED TO BE TALKING

00:48:16.360 --> 00:48:17.794
ABOUT USING?

00:48:17.861 --> 00:48:18.395
GRAZING WE NEED TO BE TALKING

00:48:18.462 --> 00:48:19.630
ABOUT.

00:48:19.696 --> 00:48:20.998
MASTICATION THERE'S EQUIPMENT

00:48:21.064 --> 00:48:23.367
THAT KNOCKS THE BRUSH DOWN AND

00:48:23.433 --> 00:48:24.701
THE FORCED ME TO TALK ABOUT

00:48:24.768 --> 00:48:25.002
DOING GOOD.

00:48:25.068 --> 00:48:26.403
SOLID.

00:48:26.470 --> 00:48:27.971
ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY FOREST

00:48:28.038 --> 00:48:29.473
POLICIES AND THAT'S AN AREA THAT

00:48:29.539 --> 00:48:31.475
I HAPPEN TO BE DONE A LOT OF

00:48:31.541 --> 00:48:32.676
WORK ON WITH --

00:48:32.743 --> 00:48:35.178
OTHER MEMBERS OF THIS BODY.

00:48:35.245 --> 00:48:36.980
SO I GUESS WHAT I'M GONNA WRAP

00:48:37.047 --> 00:48:38.115
UP WAS SAYING IS THAT WE MET WE

00:48:38.181 --> 00:48:39.850
BETTER MAKE SURE THAT WE PUT THE

00:48:39.916 --> 00:48:42.019
RESOURCES INTO --

00:48:42.085 --> 00:48:43.587
OUR BEDS MANAGEMENT PART OF IT

00:48:43.654 --> 00:48:45.322
OVER SOME TIME BECAUSE WE HAVE A

00:48:45.389 --> 00:48:46.890
LOT OF WORK TO DO TO CATCH UP

00:48:46.957 --> 00:48:48.392
WITH THE AMOUNT OF VEGETATION

00:48:48.458 --> 00:48:50.093
IT'S GROWN OVER THE TIME WE ALSO

00:48:50.160 --> 00:48:52.529
NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE MAKE

00:48:52.596 --> 00:48:52.796
THOSE --

00:48:52.863 --> 00:48:55.666
IOUS SOLVENT SO THAT WE CAN

00:48:55.732 --> 00:48:56.667
LESSEN THE IMPACT TO ALL THE

00:48:56.733 --> 00:48:59.303
RATE PAYERS SO THAT'S MY GOAL I

00:48:59.369 --> 00:49:00.937
THINK THIS IS A GOOD TEMPLATE.

00:49:01.004 --> 00:49:01.972
TO DO BOTH THE CHAIRS I KNOW

00:49:02.039 --> 00:49:04.875
THAT THIS IS ON IT'S IT'S HEART

00:49:04.941 --> 00:49:06.777
WRENCHING TO SEE THE LIVES LOST

00:49:15.385 --> 00:49:17.454
ABOUT THAT BUT WE'RE GONNA MAKE

00:49:17.521 --> 00:49:21.758

IN THE GAME.

00:49:25.195 --> 00:49:25.696
AND WE WILL MAKE SURE THAT

00:49:25.762 --> 00:49:26.830
THEY'RE NOT GIVING JUNE GIANT

00:49:26.897 --> 00:49:28.465

ONE AND BUT AT THE SAME TIME WE

00:49:31.201 --> 00:49:31.968
NEED TO MAKE SURE THEY'RE STILL

00:49:32.035 --> 00:49:35.505
IN BUSINESS BECAUSE WITHOUT THEM --

00:49:35.572 --> 00:49:36.573
THE RATEPAYERS WILL BURKE.

00:49:38.175 --> 00:49:39.976
AGAIN I WILL LOOK FORWARD TO THE

00:49:40.043 --> 00:49:41.712
LANGUAGE THE DEVIL'S IN THE

00:49:41.778 --> 00:49:42.779

TOOLS THAT WERE LAYING OUT ON

00:49:52.723 --> 00:49:53.757
THE GROUND OUT THERE NOTHING'S

00:49:53.824 --> 00:49:55.359

00:50:18.515 --> 00:50:20.183
IN REGARDS TO THIS --

00:50:20.250 --> 00:50:21.985
BETWEEN BRIAN AND I IN THE UP

RESPONSIBILITY.

00:50:43.206 --> 00:50:45.442
WHICH IS THE THE FOREST AND

00:50:45.509 --> 00:50:48.211
LANDSCAPE ABOUT MANAGEMENT AND I

00:50:50.213 --> 00:50:52.449
A PLAN AND I KNOW THAT BOTH OF

00:50:52.516 --> 00:50:53.250
THEM HAVE BEEN WORKING AN AWFUL

00:50:53.316 --> 00:50:53.884
LOT.

00:50:53.950 --> 00:50:55.018
I'M ON THIS AND THEY'VE BEEN

00:50:55.085 --> 00:50:57.254
DOING A FANTASTIC WORK IN

00:50:57.320 --> 00:50:58.522
REGARDS --

00:50:58.588 --> 00:51:00.424
TO THE FORCED HIM LANDSCAPE UP

00:51:00.490 --> 00:51:00.991
MANAGEMENT SIDE [inaudible]

00:51:01.057 --> 00:51:02.826
I THINK.

00:51:02.893 --> 00:51:03.927
THE CONFERENCE REPORT THAT WE

00:51:03.994 --> 00:51:05.362
ARE THAT I HOPE TO BE ABLE TO

00:51:05.429 --> 00:51:07.330
SIGN ON TO THE WILL ALSO THOUGH

00:51:07.397 --> 00:51:08.165
ADDRESS.

00:51:08.231 --> 00:51:09.866
AT THE QUESTION OF HOW WE DEAL

00:51:09.933 --> 00:51:11.134
WITH -- WITH

00:51:11.201 --> 00:51:13.370
COST RECOVERY.

00:51:13.437 --> 00:51:14.938
HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE --

00:51:15.005 --> 00:51:17.474
I USE THAT ARE AMMAN FIRM

00:51:17.541 --> 00:51:18.508
FINANCIAL --

00:51:18.575 --> 00:51:21.378
GROUND A BECAUSE THE DETAILS

00:51:21.445 --> 00:51:23.747
MATTER AND WHAT WE HAVE BEFORE

00:51:23.814 --> 00:51:25.148
US TODAY AND WE DON'T HAVE ANY

00:51:25.215 --> 00:51:27.717
LANGUAGE IN YET THAT WE'VE SEEN.

00:51:27.784 --> 00:51:30.253
AND IN REGARDS TO A TO THAT.

00:51:30.320 --> 00:51:31.455
I JUST LIKE A SOME OF OUR DAILY

00:51:31.521 --> 00:51:33.990
SAID IT SEEMS VERY CLEAR THAT --

00:51:34.057 --> 00:51:35.892
WELL LIABILITY REFORM A DEALING

00:51:35.959 --> 00:51:37.527
WITH INVERSE CONDEMNATION IN THE

00:51:37.594 --> 00:51:38.762
CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUES THAT ARE

00:51:38.829 --> 00:51:41.264
THERE IS OFF THE TABLE ONCE THAT

00:51:41.331 --> 00:51:43.033
IS OFF THE TABLE ARE ONLY TWO

00:51:43.099 --> 00:51:44.334
OTHER OPTIONS ARE.

00:51:44.401 --> 00:51:49.039
EITHER TO DO NOTHING OR TO THING

00:51:49.105 --> 00:51:49.639
IT COMES DOWN TO THAT QUESTION

00:51:49.706 --> 00:51:52.275
OF THE SAME QUESTION WE'VE KNOWN

00:51:52.342 --> 00:51:55.312
NOW 445- MONTHS IS WHO PAYS.

00:51:55.378 --> 00:51:57.013
AND WHEN DO THEY PAY.

00:51:57.080 --> 00:51:58.949
AND SO THE DETAILS ARE ARE GOING

00:51:59.015 --> 00:51:59.883
TO MATTER.

00:51:59.950 --> 00:52:01.017
THE DIFFERENCE IS WE KNOW

00:52:01.084 --> 00:52:02.853
BETWEEN THE I USE IN THE PO USES

00:52:02.919 --> 00:52:04.187
THAT THAT THE THE PUBLIC

00:52:04.254 --> 00:52:05.755
UTILITIES SOME ARE OWNED BY THE

00:52:05.822 --> 00:52:08.225
SAME FOLKS THEIR SHAREHOLDERS.

00:52:08.291 --> 00:52:09.860
AND THE OWNERS OF THOSE

00:52:09.926 --> 00:52:10.961
MUNICIPAL CORPORATIONS ARE THE

00:52:11.027 --> 00:52:12.629
SAME.

00:52:12.696 --> 00:52:13.897
IN REGARDS THE INVESTOR OWNED

00:52:13.964 --> 00:52:16.633
UTILITY THEY ARE DIFFERENT THE

00:52:16.700 --> 00:52:17.767
SHE THE RATE PAYERS ARE

00:52:17.834 --> 00:52:21.238
DIFFERENT THEN THE SHAREHOLDERS.

00:52:21.304 --> 00:52:22.506
AND SO ON WERE THINKING ABOUT

00:52:22.572 --> 00:52:23.440
THAT LIABILITY THE QUESTION IS

00:52:23.507 --> 00:52:25.175
IS.

00:52:25.242 --> 00:52:27.110
WHO PAYS AND WHEN WE NEED TO

00:52:27.177 --> 00:52:29.246
MAKE SURE THAT WE WE GET DOWN TO

00:52:29.312 --> 00:52:30.647
THE NITTY GRITTY THERE?

00:52:30.714 --> 00:52:32.115
WE ALSO NEED TO I BELIEVE

00:52:32.182 --> 00:52:32.382
SEPARATE.

00:52:32.449 --> 00:52:35.151
A WHAT'S GOING FORWARD AND WERE

00:52:35.218 --> 00:52:35.986
TALK ABOUT COST RECOVERY

00:52:36.052 --> 00:52:37.787
PROVIDING CERTAINTIES ARE GOING

00:52:37.854 --> 00:52:39.422
FORWARD BUT ALSO REALIZE IT

00:52:39.489 --> 00:52:41.458
THERE IS GONNA THAT THERE HAS

00:52:41.525 --> 00:52:42.792
BEEN AND WE DON'T KNOW.

00:52:42.859 --> 00:52:44.294
EXACTLY YET WHAT THE TOTAL

00:52:44.361 --> 00:52:45.896
AMOUNT OF LIABILITY IS FOR

00:52:45.962 --> 00:52:47.631
WHAT'S HAPPENED IN THE PAST BUT

00:52:47.697 --> 00:52:49.933
WHAT I WILL SAY IS WE'VE GOT TO

00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:50.700
MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS

00:52:50.767 --> 00:52:51.535
CERTAINTY.

00:52:51.601 --> 00:52:53.169
OF FOR P. GENIE AND THAT THERE

00:52:53.236 --> 00:52:55.372
IS CERTAINTY AS WE GO FORWARD

00:52:55.438 --> 00:52:56.840
I'M ONE EMPIRE HOPE THAT THAT

00:52:56.907 --> 00:52:58.275
THE CONFERENCE REPORT AS WE TALK

00:52:58.341 --> 00:52:59.476
ABOUT COST RECOVERY.

00:52:59.543 --> 00:53:00.877
WILL DEAL WITH SOME LEVEL OF

00:53:00.944 --> 00:53:03.480
CERTAINTY AND NOT JUST SOME HOPE

00:53:03.547 --> 00:53:05.882
SO LOOK FOR THE CONVERSATION.

00:53:05.949 --> 00:53:06.449
SO A MEMBER ASSEMBLY MEMBER

00:53:06.516 --> 00:53:07.651
WOULD.

00:53:07.717 --> 00:53:08.718
YES I WOULD SAY THANK YOU THE

00:53:08.785 --> 00:53:10.220
CHAIRS AND MY FELLOW CONFEREES

00:53:10.287 --> 00:53:11.621
IT'S BEEN ON A FASCINATING

00:53:11.688 --> 00:53:14.190
PROCESS SO FAR --

00:53:14.257 --> 00:53:15.892
WITH REGARDS TO THE PROPOSAL

00:53:15.959 --> 00:53:17.260
BEFORE US --

00:53:17.327 --> 00:53:18.361
COUPLE OF THINGS I'D LIKE TO

00:53:18.428 --> 00:53:20.196
POINT OUT THAT THAT --

00:53:20.263 --> 00:53:22.866
I'D STILL AM LOOKING FOR DETAIL

00:53:22.933 --> 00:53:25.735
ON FIRST OF ALL THE IN UTILITY

00:53:25.802 --> 00:53:27.537
PROVIDER PREVENTION OF PLANNING

00:53:27.604 --> 00:53:29.906
SECTION AS WE LOOK AT THE P. YOU

00:53:29.973 --> 00:53:33.343
SEE TO OUR OVER.

00:53:33.410 --> 00:53:34.411
PLANS -- AS

00:53:34.477 --> 00:53:36.813
PER THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL --

00:53:36.880 --> 00:53:37.781
BACK -- AT

00:53:37.847 --> 00:53:39.849
OUR FIRST HEARING A ONE OF THE

00:53:39.916 --> 00:53:41.051
THINGS THAT I I BELIEVE IS

00:53:41.117 --> 00:53:43.753
MISSING ARE CONCRETE TIME FRAMES.

00:53:43.820 --> 00:53:44.788
THE LANGUAGE IS A LITTLE TOO

00:53:44.854 --> 00:53:46.022
LOOSE FROM ME --

00:53:46.089 --> 00:53:47.624
STRIVING TO GET SOMEWHERE AND

00:53:47.691 --> 00:53:48.925
ACTUALLY GETTING SOMEWHERE OR

00:53:48.992 --> 00:53:50.260
TWO DIFFERENT THINGS WHEN I

00:53:50.327 --> 00:53:51.494
DON'T WANT TO SEE AS WE HAVE A

00:53:51.561 --> 00:53:53.597
SITUATION WHERE THESE PLANTS ARE

00:53:53.663 --> 00:53:55.332
ASKED WE PUT INTO PLACE AND THEN

00:53:55.398 --> 00:53:56.333
FOLLOW UP.

00:53:56.399 --> 00:53:57.801
AND WERE LIKE FIVE YEARS OUT

00:53:57.867 --> 00:54:00.403
WERE NOT THERE AND I I YOU KNOW

00:54:00.470 --> 00:54:01.871
MAYBE IT DOESN'T HAPPEN THAT WAY

00:54:01.938 --> 00:54:04.374
BUT WITHOUT CONCRETE TIME FRAMES.

00:54:04.441 --> 00:54:06.309
THE CHANCES OF SOMETHING LIKE

00:54:06.376 --> 00:54:07.844
THAT HAPPENING ARE ARE HIGH IN

00:54:07.911 --> 00:54:09.546
MY OPINION --

00:54:09.613 --> 00:54:11.214
I WANT TO GUARANTEE THAT.

00:54:11.281 --> 00:54:11.948
AS WE GO FORWARD THAT

00:54:12.015 --> 00:54:13.783
SHAREHOLDERS PLAY FOR TO PAY

00:54:13.850 --> 00:54:15.585
FIRST THEY HAVE SKIN IN THE GAME

00:54:15.652 --> 00:54:17.354
FROM THE BEGINNING.

00:54:17.420 --> 00:54:18.888
I WANT TO GUARANTEE THAT RATE

00:54:18.955 --> 00:54:20.590
PAYER DOLLARS ARE USED TO HARDEN

00:54:20.657 --> 00:54:22.025
THE GRID.

00:54:22.092 --> 00:54:23.526
ARE USED TO INCREASE SAFETY

00:54:23.593 --> 00:54:25.228
RELIABILITY AND THAT THERE IS AN

00:54:25.295 --> 00:54:26.129
AUDIT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT

00:54:26.196 --> 00:54:28.531
HAPPENS -- I

00:54:28.598 --> 00:54:30.266
I I I WANT TO BE SURE THAT THAT

00:54:30.333 --> 00:54:31.835
THAT MONEY BEING SPENT IS

00:54:31.901 --> 00:54:32.902
ACTUALLY SPENT THE WAY IT'S

00:54:32.969 --> 00:54:34.738
SUPPOSED TO BE DONE.

00:54:34.804 --> 00:54:36.306
I'M CONCERNED ABOUT CHANGES THE

00:54:36.373 --> 00:54:37.807
RULES OF FOR THE TWO THOUSAND

00:54:37.874 --> 00:54:39.376
AND SEVENTEEN FIRES THAT WOULD

00:54:39.442 --> 00:54:41.311
PUT AN UNDUE BURDEN ON ON RATE

00:54:41.378 --> 00:54:43.513
PAYERS AND AND AND I'M I'M VERY

00:54:43.580 --> 00:54:44.914
CONCERNED ABOUT THAT.

00:54:44.981 --> 00:54:45.949
I THINK THESE ARE THINGS I

00:54:46.016 --> 00:54:47.183
HAVEN'T SEEN CODES IN THE

00:54:47.250 --> 00:54:48.652
PROPOSAL'S --

00:54:48.718 --> 00:54:49.719
AND I LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING

00:54:49.786 --> 00:54:51.354
THAT -- AND

00:54:51.421 --> 00:54:53.189
I HAVE BEEN.

00:54:53.256 --> 00:54:54.224
PRETTY OUTSPOKEN ABOUT THIS IS

00:54:54.290 --> 00:54:57.360
WITH ME FOR VEGETATION

00:54:57.427 --> 00:54:58.495
MANAGEMENT.

00:54:58.561 --> 00:54:59.763
GOING BACK TO THE ALLEY ó

00:54:59.829 --> 00:55:01.965
REPORT IN APRIL OF THIS YEAR THE

00:55:02.032 --> 00:55:03.900
RECOMMENDATION WAS THAT WE SPAN

00:55:03.967 --> 00:55:06.436
ARE ON AN ONGOING BASIS.

00:55:06.503 --> 00:55:09.005
UP BUT IT TO AT A MINIMUM OF TWO

00:55:09.072 --> 00:55:09.906
HUNDRED EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS A

00:55:09.973 --> 00:55:11.174
YEAR -- A

00:55:11.241 --> 00:55:13.576
THIRD OF OUR STATE IS FORESTED

MAYES SAID.

00:56:47.403 --> 00:56:48.238
AND AND I THINK WE TALK ABOUT

00:56:48.304 --> 00:56:49.873
LIABILITIES GOING TO BE IN ORDER

00:56:49.939 --> 00:56:51.541
RIGHT SO NUMBER ONE WE GOT TO

00:56:51.608 --> 00:56:52.909
COMPENSATE THE VICTIMS THEY'VE

00:56:52.976 --> 00:56:54.744
GOT TO BE TAKEN CARE OF NUMBER

00:56:54.811 --> 00:56:55.478
TWO WE GOT PROTECT THE

00:56:55.545 --> 00:56:57.380
RATEPAYERS REPAIR SHOULD NOT BE

00:56:57.447 --> 00:56:58.381
ON THE HOOK FOR EVERYTHING.

00:56:58.448 --> 00:57:00.083
BUT WE CANNOT BANKRUPT THE

00:57:00.150 --> 00:57:01.451
INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES IF WE

00:57:01.518 --> 00:57:03.853
DO WE WILL SEE MASSIVE INCREASES.

00:57:03.920 --> 00:57:05.155
TO ALL OF OUR UTILITY BILLS

00:57:05.221 --> 00:57:06.222

WE'RE GOING TO BE PROVIDING

00:57:07.390 --> 00:57:08.458
POWER AND SOMEBODY'S GOING TO

00:57:08.525 --> 00:57:09.993
PAY FOR IT.

00:57:10.059 --> 00:57:11.427
SO I THINK THE SECURITIZATION AS

00:57:11.494 --> 00:57:13.263
IMPORTANT I THINK A STRESS TEST

00:57:13.329 --> 00:57:15.231
WHERE WE WE GET AS MUCH OUT OF

00:57:15.298 --> 00:57:17.300
THE UTILITIES AS WE CAN AND THEN

00:57:17.367 --> 00:57:18.902
WE HAVE TO HAVE A UTILITIES THAT

00:57:18.968 --> 00:57:20.670
CAN CONTINUE TO OPERATE SO.

00:57:20.737 --> 00:57:21.638
I LIKE WHERE THIS IS GOING

00:57:21.704 --> 00:57:23.373
OBVIOUSLY WE GOT A LOOK AT THE

00:57:23.439 --> 00:57:25.275
LANGUAGE AND WE HOPEFULLY WE

00:57:25.341 --> 00:57:26.142
COME TO AN AGREEMENT ON THAT.

00:57:26.209 --> 00:57:27.243
AND WE NEED TO DO A PRETTY

00:57:27.310 --> 00:57:28.077
QUICKLY BECAUSE WE'RE RUNNING

00:57:28.144 --> 00:57:29.412
OUT OF TIME SO.

00:57:29.479 --> 00:57:30.280
I THINK WE MADE A LOT OF

00:57:30.346 --> 00:57:32.282
PROGRESS AND I WOULD LIKE TO

00:57:32.348 --> 00:57:33.850
FINISH THIS IN AND REALLY THE

00:57:33.917 --> 00:57:34.684
ULTIMATE GOAL.

00:57:34.751 --> 00:57:35.752
IS LET'S DEAL WITH THE FORCE

00:57:35.819 --> 00:57:38.087
MANAGEMENT SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE

00:57:38.154 --> 00:57:39.189
THE FIRES THAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE

00:57:39.255 --> 00:57:39.889
SO.

00:57:39.956 --> 00:57:42.425
I LIKE WE'RE GOING I DO A CENTER

00:57:42.492 --> 00:57:44.460
GAINES WHO OBVIOUSLY IS HAS HAD

00:57:44.527 --> 00:57:45.995
AREAS OF HIS DISTRICT BECAUSE OF

00:57:46.062 --> 00:57:47.463
THE WAY HE'S HAVE FIRES HE HE

00:57:47.530 --> 00:57:48.932
WANTS TO ADD --

00:57:48.998 --> 00:57:51.634
THAT WE SHOULD CONSIDER --

00:57:51.701 --> 00:57:53.036
A BLANK WHICH TO DISSUADE

00:57:53.102 --> 00:57:55.205
LOOTERS BY PROVIDING THE CASES

00:57:55.271 --> 00:57:57.106
OF GRAND THEFT LOOTING AND

00:57:57.173 --> 00:57:58.508
LOOKING OF A FIREARM WOULD BE

00:57:58.575 --> 00:58:00.276
CONSIDERED A FELONY --

00:58:00.343 --> 00:58:01.311
PER HIM THERE'S BEEN A NUMBER OF

00:58:01.377 --> 00:58:02.512
OTHERS THEN INCREASE OVER THE

00:58:02.579 --> 00:58:03.746
PAST FEW YEARS A NUMBER OF

00:58:03.813 --> 00:58:06.316
SUSPECTS ARRESTED FOR LOOTING --

00:58:06.382 --> 00:58:07.984
EXCAVATED HOMES DURING

00:58:08.051 --> 00:58:09.419

ABOUT BUT I THINK THAT'S

00:58:17.894 --> 00:58:19.395
IMPORTANT TO RUN AT A TIME I

00:58:19.462 --> 00:58:20.563
DON'T THINK THERE'S ENOUGH TIME

00:58:20.630 --> 00:58:22.899

THE OTHER THING THAT IS

00:59:29.365 --> 00:59:31.067
EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO ME HAS

00:59:31.134 --> 00:59:33.202
BEEN AT THE VERY TOP.

00:59:33.269 --> 00:59:35.838
IS MAKING SURE THAT WE PROTECT

00:59:35.905 --> 00:59:36.139
[inaudible]

00:59:36.205 --> 00:59:37.840
SOLVENCY.

00:59:37.907 --> 00:59:40.343
OF THE RATE PAYERS.

00:59:40.410 --> 00:59:41.744
THE RATE PAYERS ARE THE ONES

00:59:41.811 --> 00:59:44.681
THAT ARE NUMBER ONE ON MY LIST.

00:59:44.747 --> 00:59:46.082
I WANT TO BE SURE THAT THEY ARE

00:59:46.149 --> 00:59:48.017
NOT THE ONES THAT SUFFER BECAUSE

00:59:48.084 --> 00:59:49.786
OF MISMANAGEMENT THAT THEY ARE

00:59:49.852 --> 00:59:51.487

SOMEONE CHOSE TO DO.

00:59:53.589 --> 00:59:54.958
BUT HAD A DIFFERENT PRIORITY

00:59:55.024 --> 00:59:57.260
THAN THEY SHOULD HAVE HAD.

00:59:57.327 --> 00:59:59.162
THE RATE PAYERS MUST BE

00:59:59.228 --> 01:00:01.397
PROTECTED IN ALL OF THIS.

01:00:01.464 --> 01:00:03.399

01:00:03.466 --> 01:00:06.436
REGARDING WORKER PROTECTION --

01:00:06.502 --> 01:00:08.204
IS IN A FORM OF GRANDFATHERING

01:00:08.271 --> 01:00:09.739
OUR WORKERS WHO ARE ALSO NOT AT

01:00:09.806 --> 01:00:12.942
FAULT IN THIS.

01:00:13.009 --> 01:00:14.243
WITHOUT A DOUBT THIS IS SPIN

01:00:14.310 --> 01:00:15.845
COMPLICATED [inaudible]

01:00:15.912 --> 01:00:17.914
CHALLENGING.

01:00:17.981 --> 01:00:19.682
BUT I SINCERELY APPRECIATE THE

01:00:19.749 --> 01:00:21.617
COLLABORATIVE EFFORT.

01:00:21.684 --> 01:00:24.020
OF THE CONFEREES --

01:00:24.087 --> 01:00:26.456
HERE PRESENT.

01:00:26.522 --> 01:00:29.559
THERE'S NO QUESTION IN MY MIND

01:00:29.625 --> 01:00:31.294
ABOUT THE GENUINE CONCERN OF

01:00:31.361 --> 01:00:32.862
EVERYONE HERE.

01:00:32.929 --> 01:00:34.630
IN TRYING TO FIND A SOLUTION.

01:00:34.697 --> 01:00:38.134
THAT WILL WORK. ONE VERY

01:00:38.201 --> 01:00:39.535
SPECIFIC AREA HAS TO DO WITH

01:00:39.602 --> 01:00:41.671
BIOMASS --

01:00:41.738 --> 01:00:43.206
IT'S AN AREA THAT IN THE PAST

01:00:43.272 --> 01:00:44.741
I'VE SAID THERE'S NO WAY WE CAN

01:00:44.807 --> 01:00:47.143
AGREE TO BY A MOUSE IT'S TOO

01:00:47.210 --> 01:00:48.244
EXPENSIVE IT'S TOO DIRTY.

01:00:48.311 --> 01:00:49.212
AND I'VE.

01:00:49.278 --> 01:00:51.981
LEARNED FROM THIS CONFERENCE

01:00:52.048 --> 01:00:54.083
THAT IT'S SOMETHING THAT HAS TO

01:00:54.150 --> 01:00:56.419
BE ON THE TABLE.

01:00:56.486 --> 01:00:58.154
BUT NORTHERN CALIFORNIA AND

01:00:58.221 --> 01:00:59.222
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA ARE NOT THE

01:00:59.288 --> 01:01:00.790
SAME.

01:01:00.857 --> 01:01:01.791
AND WHEN WE LOOK AT

01:01:01.858 --> 01:01:03.526
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND

01:01:03.593 --> 01:01:05.395
BILE MOUSE IN OUR DISADVANTAGED

01:01:05.461 --> 01:01:07.263
COMMUNITIES WE HAVE TO LOOK AT

01:01:07.330 --> 01:01:09.766
THAT DIFFERENTLY.

01:01:09.832 --> 01:01:11.634
BUT I REALLY APPRECIATE

01:01:11.701 --> 01:01:13.136
EVERYTHING THAT HAS BEEN DONE.

01:01:13.202 --> 01:01:15.304
I THE REST OF OUR COMMENTS AS

01:01:15.371 --> 01:01:16.906
HAS BEEN SAID BY THE REST OF MY

01:25:40.034 --> 01:25:41.135
YOU WOULD NOT BE LOOKING

01:25:41.202 --> 01:25:42.604
RETROACTIVE AND TWO IS THAT

01:25:42.670 --> 01:25:44.105
PROTECT THERE WOULD BE

01:25:44.172 --> 01:25:44.839
PROTECTION OF REPAIRS.

01:25:44.906 --> 01:25:46.107
UNFORTUNATELY WE'RE JUST NOT

01:25:46.174 --> 01:25:48.076
SEEING THAT IN THIS PLAN.

01:25:48.142 --> 01:25:49.577
I'M UTILITY FIRE PREVENTION IN

01:25:49.644 --> 01:25:50.812
PLANNING RATEPAYERS ARE GOING TO

01:25:50.879 --> 01:25:52.780
BE PAYING FOR THAT --

01:25:52.847 --> 01:25:53.848
I OWE YOU A GREAT PAIR

SECURITIZATION RATE PAYERS ARE

01:25:57.285 --> 01:25:59.554
PAYING FOR THAT --

01:25:59.621 --> 01:26:02.624
CP YOU SEE REASONABLENESS REVIEW

01:26:02.690 --> 01:26:04.125
AND THAT ACTUALLY CHEFS

01:26:04.192 --> 01:26:05.994
LIABILITY PROTECTION MORE

01:26:06.060 --> 01:26:07.495
TOWARDS THE UTILITIES AND COSTS

01:26:07.562 --> 01:26:10.131
TOWARDS THE RATE PAYERS SO AGAIN.

01:26:10.198 --> 01:26:11.633
RATEPAYERS WILL BE PAYING FOR

01:26:11.699 --> 01:26:12.867
THAT AND WE KNOW THERE'S BEEN

01:26:12.934 --> 01:26:14.502
SOME TALK ABOUT WELL WE NEED

01:26:14.569 --> 01:26:15.970
THESE FACTORS IT ACTUALLY SAYS

01:26:16.037 --> 01:26:17.505
FACTORS OUTSIDE THE CONTROL OF

01:26:17.572 --> 01:26:20.341
THE AYE YOU WILL RATE PEERS HAVE

01:26:20.408 --> 01:26:21.876
NO CONTROL OVER THIS EITHER.

01:26:21.943 --> 01:26:23.912
WE DON'T MAKE THE PLANS WE DON'T

01:26:23.978 --> 01:26:25.246
MANAGE THE SYSTEM SO WE REALLY

01:26:25.313 --> 01:26:26.781
DON'T HAVE CONTROL.

01:26:26.848 --> 01:26:28.283
AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING

01:26:28.349 --> 01:26:30.084
THE LANGUAGE BUT WE ARE STILL

01:26:30.151 --> 01:26:31.920
CONCERNED ABOUT THIS TURNING

01:26:31.986 --> 01:26:33.087
INTO SOME SORT OF BAIL OUT THANK

01:26:33.154 --> 01:26:33.254
YOU.

01:26:33.321 --> 01:26:34.022
YOU [inaudible]

01:26:34.088 --> 01:26:36.624
SPEAKER AT I THANK YOU MISTER

01:26:36.691 --> 01:26:37.325
CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE

01:26:37.392 --> 01:26:38.760
COMMITTEE MICHAEL SAW CALIFORNIA

01:26:38.826 --> 01:26:40.094
MANUFACTURES AND TECHNOLOGY

01:26:40.161 --> 01:26:41.129
ASSOCIATION.

01:26:41.195 --> 01:26:42.497
I THINK I SHARE THE CONCERNS OF

01:26:42.564 --> 01:26:43.231
COLLEAGUES HAVE COME RIGHT

01:26:43.298 --> 01:26:44.165
BEFORE --

01:26:44.232 --> 01:26:45.934
FROM AG INDUSTRY SIDE OF THINGS

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:47.335
THAT THIS --

01:26:47.402 --> 01:26:49.337
LOOKS LIKE A BAILOUT SMELLS LIKE

01:26:49.404 --> 01:26:50.972
A BAILOUT IN.

01:26:51.039 --> 01:26:52.507
CERTAINLY FEELS LIKE A BAILOUT --

01:26:52.574 --> 01:26:54.409
AS IS MENTIONED THERE SEEM TO BE

01:26:54.475 --> 01:26:55.610
A LOT OF ADDITIONAL.

01:26:55.677 --> 01:26:57.111
THE RATE PAYER COSTS ASSOCIATED

01:26:57.178 --> 01:26:58.813
WITH THIS AND I THINK ONE THING

01:26:58.880 --> 01:26:59.981
THAT I'VE HEARD FROM SEVERAL

01:27:00.048 --> 01:27:01.516
COMMITTEE MEMBERS --

01:27:01.583 --> 01:27:03.051
PREVIOUSLY DURING YOUR COMMENTS

01:27:03.117 --> 01:27:05.486
WAS A CONCERN ABOUT SHAREHOLDERS

01:27:05.553 --> 01:27:06.721
AND SHAREHOLDERS BEING FIRST TO

01:27:06.788 --> 01:27:07.755
PAY.

01:27:07.822 --> 01:27:09.657
WE DON'T SEE THAT HERE IN THIS

01:27:09.724 --> 01:27:10.925
OUTLINE AND WE HAVEN'T HEARD A

01:27:10.992 --> 01:27:12.460
DESCRIPTION OF A SCENARIO IN

01:27:12.527 --> 01:27:13.094
WHICH SHAREHOLDERS ARE GOING TO

01:27:13.161 --> 01:27:14.395
BE.

01:27:14.462 --> 01:27:15.597
FIRST AT THE TABLE IN PAYING

01:27:15.663 --> 01:27:16.998
THIS AND THAT WAS ONE OF OUR

01:27:17.065 --> 01:27:19.033
PRIMARY AND IN MAJOR CONCERNS

01:27:19.100 --> 01:27:20.668
PREVIOUSLY.

01:27:20.735 --> 01:27:22.337
THAT WAS EXPRESSED ALL OF YOU

01:27:22.403 --> 01:27:23.771
BOTH IN TESTIMONY AND MEETINGS

01:27:23.838 --> 01:27:25.506
WAS THAT SHAREHOLDERS HAVE SOME

01:27:25.573 --> 01:27:26.407
SKIN IN THE GAME.

01:27:26.474 --> 01:27:28.543
AND WE STILL DON'T SEE THAT HERE

01:27:28.610 --> 01:27:30.445
AND I REALIZE THAT THIS IS BEEN

01:27:30.511 --> 01:27:31.813
CELLS ARE WILL TIMES THE DEVIL'S

01:27:31.879 --> 01:27:33.514
IN THE DETAILS ON THE LANGUAGE.

01:27:33.581 --> 01:27:35.416
BUT GIVEN THE CONCERNS A REPAIR

01:27:35.483 --> 01:27:36.751
GROUPS HAVE EXPRESSED YOU

01:27:36.818 --> 01:27:38.419
MULTIPLE TIMES WE WOULD HAVE

01:27:38.486 --> 01:27:40.054
HOPE TO SEE IN THIS OUTLINE.

01:27:40.121 --> 01:27:41.689
SOMETHING SPECIFIC TO THAT POINT

01:27:41.756 --> 01:27:43.091
HERE AND I THINK IT'S MISTER

01:27:43.157 --> 01:27:44.826
DALI IN MISTER WOULD BOTH

01:27:44.892 --> 01:27:46.260
EXPRESSED PREVIOUSLY.

01:27:46.327 --> 01:27:48.129
THEY'LL THIS SPECIFIC POINT THAT

01:27:48.196 --> 01:27:50.365
SHAREHOLDERS PAY FIRST AND WOOD

01:27:50.431 --> 01:27:51.733
TO THAT POINT WERE DISAPPOINTED

01:27:51.799 --> 01:27:53.034
I THINK IN THIS.

01:27:53.101 --> 01:27:54.836
YOU KNOW OUTLINED HAS BEEN LAID

01:27:54.902 --> 01:27:56.571
OUT THIS MORNING THAT WE'RE NOT

01:27:56.638 --> 01:27:58.306
SEEING THAT WE HEAR IT.

01:27:58.373 --> 01:28:00.074
BUT WE DON'T SEE IT AND THAT'S

01:28:00.141 --> 01:28:01.609
OF CONCERN THREE PAIR HAVE.

01:28:01.676 --> 01:28:03.211
WE WANT TO AVOID A BAIL OUT THE

01:28:03.277 --> 01:28:04.846
UTILITIES WE UNDERSTAND THE

01:28:04.912 --> 01:28:06.280
RATEPAYERS ARE GOING TO CARRY

01:28:06.347 --> 01:28:07.515
SOME OF THE BURDEN.

01:28:07.582 --> 01:28:09.217
THAT IN THIS SCENARIO IT APPEARS

01:28:09.283 --> 01:28:10.585
TO BE.

01:28:10.652 --> 01:28:11.886
ALL OR AT LEAST BY AND LARGE

01:28:11.953 --> 01:28:13.454
MOST OF THE COSTS ARE GOING TO

01:28:13.521 --> 01:28:15.523
FALL ON REPAIRS AND GIVEN THAT

01:28:15.590 --> 01:28:17.191
WE ARE ALREADY.

01:28:17.258 --> 01:28:19.961
NEARLY 1100%.

01:28:20.028 --> 01:28:22.163
ABOVE THE HOUSE NATIONAL AVERAGE

01:28:22.230 --> 01:28:23.831
FOR ELECTRICITY RATES.

01:28:23.898 --> 01:28:25.900
ON THE INDUSTRIAL SIDE.

01:28:25.967 --> 01:28:27.535
WE JUST CAN'T BEAR ANYMORE IT

01:28:27.602 --> 01:28:29.303
THIS HAS A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON

01:28:29.370 --> 01:28:31.039
OUR ABILITY TO INVEST IN THIS

01:28:31.105 --> 01:28:33.508
STATE TO CREATE JOBS.

01:28:33.574 --> 01:28:35.476
THAT PROVIDE FOR OUR FAMILIES

01:28:35.543 --> 01:28:37.278
AND HELP BUILD THE MIDDLE CLASS.

01:28:37.345 --> 01:28:39.080
WE UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF

01:28:39.147 --> 01:28:40.915
HAVING A VIABLE UTILITY BUT IF

01:28:40.982 --> 01:28:41.749
IT COMES AT THE RATE PAYERS

01:28:41.816 --> 01:28:43.151
EXPENSE.

01:28:43.217 --> 01:28:48.156
WHAT WHAT HAVE WE GAINED?

01:28:48.222 --> 01:28:49.357
MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS

01:28:49.424 --> 01:28:50.692
MICHAEL VOCAL OR ON BEHALF OF

01:28:50.758 --> 01:28:51.726
THE AG ENERGY CONSUMERS

01:28:51.793 --> 01:28:53.327
ASSOCIATION I THINK IT GOES

01:28:53.394 --> 01:28:54.395
WITHOUT SAYING THAT A HAVE A

01:28:54.462 --> 01:28:55.930
GREAT DEAL OF RESPECT FOR THE

01:28:55.997 --> 01:28:57.365
COMMITTEE CHAIRS AND ALL THE

01:28:57.432 --> 01:28:58.800
MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE.

01:28:58.866 --> 01:28:59.934
BUT I DO SHARE SOME OF THE

01:29:00.001 --> 01:29:01.436
FRUSTRATIONS OF THE OTHER RATE

01:29:01.502 --> 01:29:02.937
PAYER ADVOCATES THAT HAVE

01:29:03.004 --> 01:29:04.205
BROUGHT FORWARD TODAY.

01:29:04.272 --> 01:29:05.540
I'M GONNA FOCUS ON A COUPLE OF

01:29:05.606 --> 01:29:06.741
POINTS THAT MISTER WOOD BROUGHT

01:29:06.808 --> 01:29:08.042
UP AND THAT IS.

01:29:08.109 --> 01:29:10.211
IN ALL THE PREVIOUS DISCUSSIONS

01:29:10.278 --> 01:29:11.312
WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT

01:29:11.379 --> 01:29:13.114
PROSPECT OF CHANGES TO THE

01:29:13.181 --> 01:29:15.683
LIABILITY CHANGES AND THE COST

01:29:15.750 --> 01:29:17.051
RECOVERY CHANGES.

01:29:17.118 --> 01:29:18.820
WE'RE NOW SUDDENLY TALKING ABOUT

01:29:18.886 --> 01:29:22.490
RETROACTIVE CHANGES TO TWENTY

01:29:22.557 --> 01:29:23.391
SEVENTEEN AND WHAT WE WERE TOLD

01:29:23.458 --> 01:29:24.992
IN THE BRIEFING LAST NIGHT.

01:29:25.059 --> 01:29:27.028
EVEN PRIOR TO TWENTY SEVENTEEN

01:29:27.095 --> 01:29:28.062
THIS COULD GO ALL THE WAY BACK

01:29:28.129 --> 01:29:30.131
TO THE BUTTE FIRE IN TWENTY

01:29:30.198 --> 01:29:30.965
FIFTEEN AND OTHERS THAT HAVEN'T

01:29:31.032 --> 01:29:32.667
COME BEFORE THE COMMISSION.

01:29:32.734 --> 01:29:35.069
AND THAT IS EXTREMELY EXTREMELY.

01:29:35.136 --> 01:29:37.071
CONCERNING TO US.

01:29:37.138 --> 01:29:38.573
I WANT TO FOCUS ON THE OTHER

01:29:38.639 --> 01:29:40.875
POINT THAT WE HEARD CONSISTENTLY.

01:29:40.942 --> 01:29:42.677
AND THAT IS THAT THE UTILITIES

01:29:42.744 --> 01:29:45.012
PGA IN PARTICULAR WILL BE HELD

01:29:45.079 --> 01:29:46.481
RESPONSIBLE WHEN THEY'RE

01:29:46.547 --> 01:29:49.650
NEGLIGENT OR OR THEY FAILED TO

01:29:49.717 --> 01:29:50.685
DO WHAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO DO

01:29:50.752 --> 01:29:51.652
OTHER IMPRUDENT OR THEY'RE AT

01:29:51.719 --> 01:29:52.954
FAULT.

01:29:53.020 --> 01:29:55.056
THAT TOO HAS CHANGED UNDER THIS

01:29:55.123 --> 01:29:57.091
PROPOSAL OR IS ABOUT TO CHANGE

01:29:57.158 --> 01:29:58.726
INTO THIS PROPOSAL BECAUSE

01:29:58.793 --> 01:30:00.128
YOU'RE NOT ONLY LOOKING IT

01:30:00.194 --> 01:30:01.496
NEGLIGENCE AND FAULT.

YOU'RE ALSO LOOKING AT THESE

01:30:02.530 --> 01:30:04.398
OTHER FACTORS.

SO THAT IS A VERY VERY

01:30:05.299 --> 01:30:07.702
SIGNIFICANT CHANGE THAT WE'RE

01:41:01.355 --> 01:41:02.756
BRIGHTER LINE NOW.

01:41:02.823 --> 01:41:04.258
ON WHAT UTILITIES CAN AND CAN'T

01:41:04.324 --> 01:41:07.161

SOLUTION BIO ENERGY IS KEY --

01:41:28.816 --> 01:41:30.517
AND AS YOU KNOW FROM --

EIGHT NINETY THREE THEY WANT TO

RESPONSIBLE SOLUTION AND THE

01:41:35.756 --> 01:41:37.357
MOST EFFICIENT THEY WANT TO DO

01:41:37.424 --> 01:41:38.625
THIS IN THE MOST EFFICIENT WAY

01:41:38.692 --> 01:41:40.761

REFORM NETWORK RESIDENTIAL

01:41:53.807 --> 01:41:54.775
RATEPAYERS.

01:41:54.842 --> 01:41:55.909
OTHER NUMBER OF DETAILS THAT

01:41:55.976 --> 01:41:57.077
WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO

01:41:57.144 --> 01:41:58.111
REVIEWING --

01:41:58.178 --> 01:41:59.680
BUT THE LANGUAGE COMES OUT AND

01:41:59.746 --> 01:42:00.714
ME JUST MENTION A COUPLE KEY

01:42:00.781 --> 01:42:02.549
POINTS. FOR US AYE NUMBER ONE

01:42:02.616 --> 01:42:04.017
AND I THINK.

01:42:04.084 --> 01:42:05.519
AT LEAST SOMEWHAT --

01:42:05.586 --> 01:42:07.087
THE OUTLINE DOES CREATE KIND OF

01:42:07.154 --> 01:42:08.856
AIR TYPE PROTECTION. FOR

01:42:08.922 --> 01:42:11.892
RATEPAYERS IN THE EVENT THAT --

01:42:11.959 --> 01:42:13.861
UTILITIES FOUND TO BE IMPRUDENT --

01:42:13.927 --> 01:42:15.395
AND THAT'S REALLY REALLY KEY FOR

01:42:15.462 --> 01:42:17.130
US IT HAS TO BE AIRTIGHT.

01:42:17.197 --> 01:42:18.532
I UNDERSTAND THAT MIGHT BE BE

01:42:18.599 --> 01:42:19.466
FINANCIAL BURDEN FOR THE

01:42:19.533 --> 01:42:20.834
UTILITIES BUT IF THEY'VE ACTED

01:42:20.901 --> 01:42:21.835
IMPRUDENTLY.

01:42:21.902 --> 01:42:23.437
THEN IT SHOULD STILL REMAIN WITH

01:42:23.504 --> 01:42:25.372
UTILITIES --

01:42:25.439 --> 01:42:28.108
ON THE ISSUE OF THE RATE PAYER --

01:42:28.175 --> 01:42:30.777
BONDS --

01:42:30.844 --> 01:42:32.379
PROTECTION BONDS WHAT'S GOING TO

01:42:32.446 --> 01:42:33.947
BE KEY FOR US IS TO SEE WHETHER

01:42:34.014 --> 01:42:34.515
OR NOT.

01:42:34.581 --> 01:42:36.450
THOSE BONDS OR AN OPTION

01:42:36.517 --> 01:42:39.019
PROVIDED TO THIS DEEP YOU SEE OR

01:42:39.086 --> 01:42:40.821
IS IT THE ONLY OPTION AND THAT'S

01:42:40.888 --> 01:42:41.388
IMPORTANT FOR THE FOLLOWING

01:42:41.455 --> 01:42:43.824
REASON --

01:42:43.891 --> 01:42:45.492
THE COMMISSION WILL DETERMINE

01:42:45.559 --> 01:42:47.194
IMPRUDENT SEE WHETHER SOMEONE

01:42:47.261 --> 01:42:48.662
ACTED PRUDENTLY ARE NOT.

01:42:48.729 --> 01:42:50.497
THEN THEY WILL SAY OKAY FOR THE

01:42:50.564 --> 01:42:53.500
NON NEGLIGENT LIABILITY.

01:42:53.567 --> 01:42:56.103
THESE BONDS WILL BE USED THAT

01:42:56.169 --> 01:42:58.839
MEANS ON 101100%.

01:42:58.906 --> 01:43:01.608
OF THE NON NEGLIGENT LIABILITY

01:43:01.675 --> 01:43:02.543
WILL GO TO RATEPAYERS YES IT'S

01:43:02.609 --> 01:43:04.978
FINANCED YES IT MAY BE LOWERED

01:43:05.045 --> 01:43:06.680
OVER A NUMBER OF YEARS.

01:43:06.747 --> 01:43:08.448
BUT IF IT'S THE ONLY OPTION FOR

01:43:08.515 --> 01:43:09.850
THE COMMISSION THEN IT'S THE

01:43:09.917 --> 01:43:11.985
RATEPAYERS WILL PAY TO US WE

01:43:12.052 --> 01:43:13.387
THINK THAT'S PROBLEMATIC IN THE

01:43:13.453 --> 01:43:14.788
SAME WAY THAT UTILITIES.

01:43:14.855 --> 01:43:17.457
WILL ARGUE THEY SHOULDN'T PAY.

01:43:17.524 --> 01:43:19.426
FOR LIABILITY DOT THEY WERE NOT

01:43:19.493 --> 01:43:20.994
NEGLIGENT.

01:43:21.061 --> 01:43:22.930
FOR RATEPAYERS TO SAY WELL.

01:43:22.996 --> 01:43:24.865
WE PAID FOR ALL OF PREVENTION

01:43:24.932 --> 01:43:25.165
[inaudible]

01:43:25.232 --> 01:43:27.568
ACTIVITIES AND WHY IS IT THE

01:43:27.634 --> 01:43:29.002
UTILITY GETS THE LEGAL BENEFIT

01:43:29.069 --> 01:43:31.171
OF IT AND WE DON'T SO.

01:43:31.238 --> 01:43:33.574
THE BONDS COULD BE ONE OPTION

01:43:33.640 --> 01:43:35.042
SHOULDN'T BE THE ONLY OPTION

01:43:35.108 --> 01:43:36.109
THERE SHOULD BE OTHER WAYS TO

01:43:36.176 --> 01:43:37.144
MAYBE SOCIALIZING.

01:43:37.210 --> 01:43:38.545
MAYBE THERE SHOULD BE FUNDS

01:43:38.612 --> 01:43:39.846
MAYBE SHOULD BE OTHER WAYS IT

01:43:39.913 --> 01:43:41.415
SHOULD JUST BE.

01:43:41.481 --> 01:43:42.382
ONE OF THE COMMISSION CAN A

01:43:42.449 --> 01:43:44.685
PORTION THE NON NEGLIGENT

01:43:44.751 --> 01:43:46.019

THAT THE INVESTORS ARE GOING TO

01:55:58.051 --> 01:56:00.820
BE PAID FIRST AND I THINK THAT'S

01:56:00.887 --> 01:56:03.022

01:56:05.725 --> 01:56:07.126
FORWARD --

01:56:07.193 --> 01:56:08.728
IN THE DETAILS OF THIS WE'VE

01:56:08.795 --> 01:56:09.696
HEARD A LOT OF THINGS ABOUT THE

01:56:09.762 --> 01:56:11.230
STOCK PRICE BEING DRIVEN DOWN

01:56:11.297 --> 01:56:12.332
AND IN CONCERN OVER EXISTING

01:56:12.398 --> 01:56:13.766
CONTRACTS THE LAST TIME THE

01:56:13.833 --> 01:56:14.867
STATE HAD.

01:56:14.934 --> 01:56:16.836
A MAJOR ENERGY CRISIS ALL OF

01:56:16.903 --> 01:56:17.870
THOSE CONTRACTS WERE ULTIMATELY

01:56:17.937 --> 01:56:19.372
HONORED AND THEY THEY DIDN'T

01:56:19.439 --> 01:56:20.707
FAIL SO I I'M NOT SURE THAT

01:56:20.773 --> 01:56:23.476
THAT'S IT'S ALWAYS A CONCERN.

01:56:23.543 --> 01:56:24.577
BUT I DON'T THINK IT'S SOMETHING

01:56:24.644 --> 01:56:26.746
SHOULD BE THE FRONT OF THIS LIST --

01:56:26.813 --> 01:56:29.248
AND LASTLY WE'VE PUT TOGETHER

01:56:29.315 --> 01:56:30.850
SEVERAL PROPOSALS A OF THINGS

01:56:30.917 --> 01:56:32.218
THAT WE THINK ARE ULTIMATELY

01:56:32.285 --> 01:56:33.686
REASONABLE JUST AND REASONABLE

01:56:33.753 --> 01:56:35.054
TO USE THE LANGUAGE.

01:56:35.121 --> 01:56:37.690
PARLANCE OF THE OF ENERGY POLICY

01:56:37.757 --> 01:56:39.592

01:56:43.763 --> 01:56:45.264
DETAILS MATTER.

01:56:45.331 --> 01:56:46.299
I BELIEVE I SPEAK FOR EVERYONE

YOU WANT ANY OR ALL OF US TO BE

01:56:54.841 --> 01:56:56.142

IT'S GETTING MORE RED.

01:59:31.097 --> 01:59:33.666
THIS IS THE PROBLEM.

SIX HISTORY WITH AN EXEMPTION IS

01:59:54.854 --> 01:59:57.523

RIGHT THING WHEN IT COMES TO

02:00:26.619 --> 02:00:27.353
BEING ON THE GROUND AND TAKING

02:00:27.420 --> 02:00:28.721
CARE OF OUR ENVIRONMENT.

02:00:28.788 --> 02:00:31.357
AND MAKING IT FIRE RESILIENT

02:00:31.424 --> 02:00:32.692
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO.

02:00:32.758 --> 02:00:33.726
IN AND I SAID EARLIER IN THE

02:00:33.793 --> 02:00:35.328
FOREST.

02:00:35.394 --> 02:00:36.629
WE ARE GONNA DO WE HAVE TOO MANY

02:00:36.696 --> 02:00:39.432
TREES AND SOME OF THOSE TREES.

02:00:39.498 --> 02:00:40.666
A LITTLE BIT BIGGER AND ACTUALLY

02:00:40.733 --> 02:00:41.534
THOSE ONES A LITTLE BIT BIGGER

02:00:41.601 --> 02:00:43.436

SO WE'LL BE DOING THAT DYNAMIC

02:00:45.871 --> 02:00:48.174
BALANCE AT THE AT THE RIGHT WAY.

02:00:48.240 --> 02:00:50.309
AND IT WILL BE ALL UP FRONT AND

02:00:50.376 --> 02:00:51.777
WILL NOT BE A THIRTY SIX HISTORY

02:00:51.844 --> 02:00:54.146
AND THE ACTUAL SIZE OF TREES PER

02:00:54.213 --> 02:00:55.915
ACRE WILL GO UP BECAUSE WE'RE

02:00:55.982 --> 02:00:56.482
TAKE ON THE LITTLE ONES OUT

02:00:56.549 --> 02:01:10.062

02:01:13.499 --> 02:01:14.567
THINGS HAVE BEEN SAID --

02:01:14.634 --> 02:01:16.268
AND THE COMMENTS FROM THE PUBLIC

02:01:16.335 --> 02:01:17.870
IS ALWAYS APPRECIATED I JUST

02:01:17.937 --> 02:01:19.205
WANT TO HIGHLIGHT.

02:01:19.271 --> 02:01:20.373
THAT HOWEVER THIS ULTIMATELY

02:01:20.439 --> 02:01:22.375
PLAYS OUT IT WILL BE SOME TYPE

02:01:22.441 --> 02:01:23.476
OF RECOMMENDATION THAT WILL

02:01:23.542 --> 02:01:24.577
HAPPEN THIS YEAR.

02:01:24.644 --> 02:01:26.112
THE OTHER PART I THINK IT'S

02:01:26.178 --> 02:01:27.713
IMPORTANT TO NOTE.

02:01:27.780 --> 02:01:30.516
IS THAT BEFORE THIS.

02:01:30.583 --> 02:01:31.083
CONFERENCE COMMITTEE STARTED

02:01:31.150 --> 02:01:32.051
MEETING.

02:01:32.118 --> 02:01:33.819
IN THE SUMMER.

02:01:33.886 --> 02:01:35.688
OF JULY WE STARTED HEARING THAT

02:01:35.755 --> 02:01:36.922
SOMEHOW.

02:01:36.989 --> 02:01:38.391
WE'RE GOING TO BE MAKING

02:01:38.457 --> 02:01:39.825
DECISIONS OUT OF THE PUBLIC'S

02:01:39.892 --> 02:01:41.427
EYE OF THE VIEW AND MAYBE NOT

02:01:41.494 --> 02:01:42.828
TAKING EVERYONE'S.

02:01:42.895 --> 02:01:45.498
AKA POINTS INTO CONSIDERATION I

02:01:45.564 --> 02:01:47.199
LIKE TO THINK I'VE HEARD AT

02:01:47.266 --> 02:01:48.467
LEAST A FEW PEOPLE SAY TODAY

02:01:48.534 --> 02:01:48.868
THAT.

02:01:48.934 --> 02:01:50.503
THAT'S NOT THE CASE THIS HAS

02:01:50.569 --> 02:01:53.339
BEEN A TRANCE PARENT PROCESS.

02:01:53.406 --> 02:01:54.907
AND WE TRIED TO COVERS MANY

02:01:54.974 --> 02:01:56.942
ELEMENTS OF WHAT WAS IMPORTANT

02:01:57.009 --> 02:01:58.277
TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION.

02:01:58.344 --> 02:02:00.312
AND NOW WE ARE.

02:02:00.379 --> 02:02:01.981
LITERALLY IN THE FOURTH QUARTER

02:02:02.048 --> 02:02:04.517
AND I THINK IT'S CLEAR THAT.

02:02:04.583 --> 02:02:06.052
AS WE'VE ALL SAID.

02:02:06.118 --> 02:02:07.720
OF THE DETAILS ARE YET TO BE
