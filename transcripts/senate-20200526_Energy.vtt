00:25:32.197 --> 00:25:33.498
OPPOSITION SIDE THE MENTION

00:25:33.565 --> 00:25:35.133
THAT THERE'S A LIFELINE PROGRAM

00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:37.202
DESIGNED TO HELP ALREADY BUT

00:25:37.269 --> 00:25:39.871
THAT'S UNDER UTILIZED- IF THERE

00:25:39.938 --> 00:25:41.039
IS ANY WAY TO JUST MAKE THAT

WOULD HELP MORE PEOPLE WOULD

00:25:46.845 --> 00:25:48.713
WOULD NOT INCREASE THE- THE

00:25:48.780 --> 00:25:50.882

00:25:50.949 --> 00:25:51.950

LIFELINE IS ONE THING BUT-

00:26:03.395 --> 00:26:04.729
THAT'S NOT GOING TO ENCOURAGE

00:26:04.796 --> 00:26:06.965

00:26:07.032 --> 00:26:08.800

BROADBAND INTERNET WILL AREAS.

01:18:18.326 --> 01:18:19.795
PROBLEM WITH THE BILL IS THAT

01:18:19.861 --> 01:18:22.564
BY EXPANDING THE ELIGIBILITY

PROGRAMS THAT WERE TO BE HANDED

01:19:00.035 --> 01:19:04.172

HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS THIS

01:19:10.846 --> 01:19:13.215
BILL OFFERS NO NEW SPENDING. SO

01:19:13.281 --> 01:19:15.717

IT IS CAN PROVIDE SOME LAST

01:19:47.149 --> 01:19:50.385
MILE RESIDENTIAL CAN ACTIVITY.

01:19:50.452 --> 01:19:52.487
HE ENDED HERE A LOT OF THE CPC

01:19:52.554 --> 01:19:54.656

01:20:06.801 --> 01:20:09.804
PROBLEMS WITH THAT AND IN ITS

01:20:09.871 --> 01:20:12.941

COMPREHENSIVE FRAMEWORK BUT THE

01:20:16.711 --> 01:20:19.915
PRIMARY. PROBLEM HERE IS THE

01:28:55.863 --> 01:28:56.397
CONSISTENTLY BUT I DO SUPPORT

01:28:56.464 --> 01:28:57.932
THIS BILL. SENATOR WIENER

01:28:57.999 --> 01:29:01.536
SENATOR MORE UP SURE- MAYBE I'M

01:29:01.602 --> 01:29:04.105
A LITTLE OLD FASHIONED BUT WHEN

01:29:04.172 --> 01:29:06.374
I WAS YOUNGER I WAS INVOLVED

01:29:06.441 --> 01:29:07.909
WITH THE SUMMER CAMP AND IT'S

01:29:07.975 --> 01:29:10.912
A- ON THE WAY TO. BIG BEAR LAKE

01:29:10.978 --> 01:29:11.813
ABOUT THREE DIFFERENT ROADS TO

01:29:11.879 --> 01:29:15.016
GO UP TO. BIG BEAR LAKE IN THIS

01:29:15.083 --> 01:29:15.683
WAS HIGHWAY THIRTY EIGHT OUT OF

01:29:15.750 --> 01:29:17.685
MEN TONE. AND WE HAD NO

01:29:17.752 --> 01:29:19.454
ELECTRICITY THERE WASN'T A LINE

01:29:19.520 --> 01:29:21.789
THAT CAME ALL THE WAY FOR ALL

01:29:21.856 --> 01:29:24.158
THOSE SUMMER CAMPS IN HOMES-

01:29:24.225 --> 01:29:24.726
WOULD HAVE TO GENERATE THEIR

01:29:24.792 --> 01:29:26.461
OWN ELECTRICITY. IT WAS SO WE

01:29:26.527 --> 01:29:27.929
DID THAT FOR THE LONGEST TIME

01:29:27.995 --> 01:29:29.897
BUT NEVER THOUGHT THAT OUR

01:29:29.964 --> 01:29:32.066
NEIGHBORS SHOULD ALL. CHIP IN

01:29:32.133 --> 01:29:35.136
AND SUBSIDIZE UP ONLINE. IT

01:29:35.203 --> 01:29:37.138
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON TO

OUR FRONT GATE AND THEN HAVE US

01:29:39.974 --> 01:29:41.876
ENJOY ELECTRICITY LIKE EVERYONE

01:29:41.943 --> 01:29:44.145
ELSE. SO I'M KIND OF LOOKING AT

01:29:44.212 --> 01:29:46.180
THIS BILL IN AND FROM THAT

01:29:46.247 --> 01:29:47.715
PERSPECTIVE YOU KNOW YOU'VE GOT

01:29:47.782 --> 01:29:50.518
AN INDUSTRY THAT. PROVIDES

01:29:50.585 --> 01:29:52.220
DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY AND WORKS

01:29:52.286 --> 01:29:53.955
FOR YEARS TO GET EVERYONE TO

01:29:54.021 --> 01:29:55.056
PARTICIPATE AND NOW THERE ARE

01:29:55.123 --> 01:29:57.725
SOME THAT. AREN'T ONLINE FOR

01:29:57.792 --> 01:29:59.160
WHATEVER PARTICULAR REASON AND

01:29:59.227 --> 01:29:59.694
NOW THERE'S SOME KIND OF

01:29:59.761 --> 01:30:01.929
ENTITLEMENT. WHERE ALL OF A

01:30:01.996 --> 01:30:03.765
SUDDEN ALL THOSE THAT ARE USING

01:30:03.831 --> 01:30:04.866
THE SERVICE NOW HAVE TO

01:30:04.932 --> 01:30:06.567
SUBSIDIZE THE ABILITY FOR

01:30:06.634 --> 01:30:08.236
OTHERS. TO GET IT SO IT'S SORT

01:30:08.302 --> 01:30:10.371
OF MORPHED INTO SOMETHING ELSE

01:30:10.438 --> 01:30:11.839
SO I. I'M HAVING A LITTLE

01:30:11.906 --> 01:30:14.008
DIFFICULTY WITH WITH THAT IDEA

01:30:14.075 --> 01:30:15.676
THAT ALL OF A SUDDEN EVERYONE.

01:30:15.743 --> 01:30:17.145

DEGREE THAT THEY HAVE NOW TRULY

02:15:39.598 --> 02:15:40.532
I THINK OUR FOCUS SHOULD HAVE

02:15:40.599 --> 02:15:43.368
BEEN ON INFRASTRUCTURE REPAIR

02:15:43.435 --> 02:15:45.604

IN PARTICULAR WITH P. JEANNIE

02:19:00.598 --> 02:19:01.566
THE LACK OF INVECTIVE

02:19:01.633 --> 02:19:03.468
INVESTMENT IN MISMANAGEMENT

02:19:03.535 --> 02:19:05.637
WHEN IT COMES TO LACK OF

02:19:05.704 --> 02:19:06.971

SEXUAL LIES ATION VEGETATION

02:19:09.674 --> 02:19:11.810
MANAGEMENT AND MODERNIZATION

02:19:11.876 --> 02:19:14.045
THAT'S THE BOTTOM LINE. IF YOU

02:19:14.112 --> 02:19:15.547
GO IN TALK WITH THEIR TOP

02:19:15.613 --> 02:19:18.483
EXECUTIVES. THEY'RE GONNA SAY

02:19:18.550 --> 02:19:20.018
ESPECIALLY IN THE VEGETATION

02:19:20.085 --> 02:19:20.652
MANAGEMENT AND ON THE

02:19:20.719 --> 02:19:22.020
MODERNIZATION THEY'RE BEHIND

02:19:22.087 --> 02:19:24.556
THIS YEAR. LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT

02:19:24.622 --> 02:19:26.958
THE ALTERNATIVE THAT WE'RE

02:19:27.025 --> 02:19:27.425
GONNA SAY TO NORTHERN

02:19:27.492 --> 02:19:29.394
CALIFORNIANS. HE GOT TEN YEARS

02:19:29.461 --> 02:19:34.065
OF THIS. TEN YEARS. IT'S

02:19:34.132 --> 02:19:35.967
UNACCEPTABLE SO WHAT THIS BILL

02:19:36.034 --> 02:19:39.871
DOES IT EXPEDITES RIGHTFULLY SO

02:19:39.938 --> 02:19:41.773
IT EXPEDITES THE GRID HARDENING

02:19:41.840 --> 02:19:43.875
THE MODERNIZATION THE SECTION

02:19:43.942 --> 02:19:45.977
LIES ATION AS WELL AS THE

02:19:46.044 --> 02:19:49.214
VEGETATION MANAGEMENT. END

02:19:49.280 --> 02:19:50.648
LET'S TALK ABOUT THE FIFTEEN

02:19:50.715 --> 02:19:52.917
PERSONAL LINES. THIS STATE

02:19:52.984 --> 02:19:56.087
ISN'T TELLING THE UTILITIES

02:19:56.154 --> 02:19:58.456
WHICH ALIGNS THEY HAVE TO TAKE

02:19:58.523 --> 02:19:59.891
UTILITIES WORK WITH THE PUBLIC

02:19:59.958 --> 02:20:00.959
UTILITIES COMMISSION IT'S IN

02:20:01.025 --> 02:20:02.594
THE BILL THE WORK WITH THE

02:20:02.660 --> 02:20:03.895
PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION ON

02:20:03.962 --> 02:20:05.497
WHICH LINES THEY'RE GOING TO

02:20:05.563 --> 02:20:08.099
FOCUS ON EMPIRE TICE BASED OFF

02:20:08.166 --> 02:20:10.402
OF WHERE THOSE POWER SHUT OFF

02:20:10.468 --> 02:20:12.737
TO WAR. THERE IS NO LANGUAGE IN

02:20:12.804 --> 02:20:13.838
THIS BILL THAT FORCE IS

02:20:13.905 --> 02:20:16.441
UTILITIES TO BE ABLE TO FOCUS

02:20:16.508 --> 02:20:18.810
ON ONE SPECIFIC LINE IT'S TEN

02:20:18.877 --> 02:20:21.579
PERCENT. AND ITS FOCUS OVER

02:20:21.646 --> 02:20:23.414
FIVE YEARS WE CUT THE TIMELINE

02:20:23.481 --> 02:20:26.918
IN FIVE YEARS IF I'M A

02:20:26.985 --> 02:20:27.585
CALIFORNIAN I THINK THAT'S-

02:20:27.652 --> 02:20:29.521
THREE YEARS TOO LONG. BECAUSE

02:20:29.587 --> 02:20:32.090
IT ENDED OR P. JEANNIE AND

02:20:32.157 --> 02:20:33.424
AUNTS ARE SPEAKING SPECIFICALLY

02:20:33.491 --> 02:20:35.059
ABOUT P. JEANNIE HAS SAID IS

02:20:35.126 --> 02:20:37.328
THEY'RE GONNA CUT THEIR FOOT

02:20:37.395 --> 02:20:40.899
PRINT THIS YEAR BY 30% 30% IT'S

02:20:40.965 --> 02:20:42.934
NOT GONNA HAPPEN. WHAT HAPPENED

02:20:43.001 --> 02:20:45.470
SO TALKING ABOUT NINE OH ONE

02:20:45.537 --> 02:20:47.705
THIS LEGISLATURE 100% GAVE

02:20:47.772 --> 02:20:49.674
UTILITIES RIGHTFULLY SO THE

02:20:49.741 --> 02:20:51.643
AUTHORITY TO BE ABLE TO TURN

02:20:51.709 --> 02:20:54.112
OFF THE POWER IN HIGH FIRE RISK

02:20:54.179 --> 02:20:56.681
PART OF THE SEASON. IT'S NOT

02:20:56.748 --> 02:20:57.582
SUPPOSED TO BE THEIR PRIMARY

02:20:57.649 --> 02:20:59.951
TO. THE REASON WHY P. GENIE IS

02:21:00.018 --> 02:21:01.286
HAD TO USE IT AS A BLUNT

02:21:01.352 --> 02:21:03.354
INSTRUMENT IS BECAUSE THEY

02:21:03.421 --> 02:21:04.055
HAVEN'T KEPT UP WITH THE

02:21:04.122 --> 02:21:05.790
MODERNIZATION THE GREAT

02:21:05.857 --> 02:21:07.058
HARDENING ERIN AND OR THE

02:21:07.125 --> 02:21:08.660
VEGETATION MANAGEMENT THEY HAVE

02:21:08.726 --> 02:21:11.429
NO OTHER TOOL TO BE ABLE TO

02:21:11.496 --> 02:21:13.064
USE. THAT'S THE BOTTOM LINE.

02:21:13.131 --> 02:21:14.432
AND WHEN IT COMES TO THE ISSUE

02:21:14.499 --> 02:21:17.001
OF. HOW WE'RE HERE IF YOU SEE

02:21:17.068 --> 02:21:17.869
ALSO HAS TO TAKE SOME

02:21:17.936 --> 02:21:19.637
RESPONSIBILITY THE LACK OF

02:21:19.704 --> 02:21:20.338
SUPERVISION BY THE PUBLIC

02:21:20.405 --> 02:21:21.472
UTILITIES COMMISSION HOLDING

02:21:21.539 --> 02:21:22.674
THEM ACCOUNTABLE THAT'S ANOTHER

02:21:22.740 --> 02:21:23.741
REASON WHY WE'RE HERE. AND IT'S

02:21:23.808 --> 02:21:25.543
JUST BE CANDID CLIMATE CHANGE

02:21:25.610 --> 02:21:27.278
NOW AS EXASPERATED THIS

02:21:27.345 --> 02:21:31.082
PROBLEM. BACK IN 20001215% OF

02:21:31.149 --> 02:21:33.384
P. GENIES LINES WERE IN A HIGH

02:21:33.451 --> 02:21:36.287
FIRE RISK ZONE TO DAY TO DAY IT

02:21:36.354 --> 02:21:38.456
IS HALF. SO WHAT I THINK WE

02:21:38.523 --> 02:21:40.358
NEED TO DO TODAY IS TELL THOSE

02:21:40.425 --> 02:21:42.594
FOLKS WHO WE WORK FOR. AVERAGE

02:21:42.660 --> 02:21:44.729
CALIFORNIANS WORKING JOES THAT

02:21:44.796 --> 02:21:46.130
WE'RE GOING TO HOLD THIS

02:21:46.197 --> 02:21:48.500
UTILITY ACCOUNTABLE. I FIRMLY

02:21:48.566 --> 02:21:49.701
BELIEVE THAT WE'RE GOING TO

02:21:49.767 --> 02:21:50.668
NEED TO MAKE SOME ADDITIONAL

02:21:50.735 --> 02:21:53.137
MINUTES AND YOU KNOW ME I WILL

02:21:53.204 --> 02:21:54.606
WORK WITH ANYONE AND EVERYONE

02:21:54.672 --> 02:21:56.307
WE'VE ALREADY TAKEN SIGNIFICANT

02:21:56.374 --> 02:21:58.042
AMENDMENTS. AND I PROMISE YOU

02:21:58.109 --> 02:21:59.110
WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO WORK

02:21:59.177 --> 02:22:00.912
ON THIS BILL BUT I GOTTA TELL

02:22:00.979 --> 02:22:02.146
YA I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANYONE

02:22:02.213 --> 02:22:03.815
IN THIS LEGISLATURE RIGHT NOW

02:22:03.882 --> 02:22:05.416
THAT WILL STAND UP AND DEFEND.

02:22:05.483 --> 02:22:07.552
TEACHING THESE ACTIONS WE HAVE

02:22:07.619 --> 02:22:08.820
TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HOLD THEM

02:22:08.887 --> 02:22:10.622
ACCOUNTABLE IN WORK WITH THE
