TENTH HEARING OF THE ASSEMBLY HUMAN SERVICES COMMITTEE ARE TODAY WE HAVE TWENTY THREE BILLS UP. AYE TEN OF WHICH ON CONSENT. AS A REMINDER WE ALLOW TWO WITNESSES IN SUPPORT INTO WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION FOR EACH BILL EACH OF THESE WITNESSES SHOULD LIMIT THERE'S TESTIMONY TO TWO MINUTES. ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES MAY ADD THEIR SUPPORT OR OPPOSITION BY STATING ONLY THEIR NAME AND ORGANIZATION GIVEN THE LENGTH OF TODAY'S AGENDA WE ASK THAT YOU PLEASE HONOR THESE TIME LIMITS. OUT OF RESPECT FOR EVERYONE WHO IS HERE TO TESTIFY TODAY WILL GO AHEAD AND START IS A SUBCOMMITTEE WE ARE WAITING FOR A COUPLE OTHER MEMBERS. AND. SO I HAVE MISSED AGUIAR CURRY. UP IF YOU CAN IT'S COME UP GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS. AB TWENTY TWO NINETY TO INVEST IN A BETTER SYSTEM OF CARE FOR OUR CHILDREN BY INCREASING THE STATE'S CAPACITY TO SERVE THEM. THIS WILL BE THIS BILL WILL DO THIS IN THREE WAYS. FIRST AB TWENTY TWO NINETY TWO WILL INCREASE THE RATE PAID TO CHILDCARE CENTER BASED PROGRAMS. CARE FOR INFANTS BY INCREASING THE INFANT TODDLER RATE FACTOR. SECOND IT WILL CREATE AN INCLUSIVE GRANT PROGRAM UTILIZING ONE TIME FUNDS. TO REMODEL OR RENOVATE AND EXPAND FACILITIES THE SERVE CHILDREN AGES ZERO TO FIVE IN HIGH NEED COMMUNITIES. AND THIRD IT WILL PROVIDE ADDITIONAL ONE TIME FUNDS TO RECRUIT AND TRAIN A NEW GENERATION OF FAMILY CARE. A CHILD CARE PROVIDERS. AS A SINGLE MOTHER I KNOW FIRST. HAND HOW HARD IT IS TO FIND GOOD QUALITY CHILDCARE THAT IS CONVENIENT AND AFFORDABLE. IT IS DIFFICULT IF NOT IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND CARE FOR INFANTS FROM ZERO TO THREE. THE MAJORITY OF CALIFORNIA PARENTS FACE THIS DILEMMA. THEY'RE STRUGGLING TO COBBLE TOGETHER WHATEVER CHILD. CHILD CARE THEY CAN FIND ARE GOING WITHOUT IT ENTIRELY. THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE. WE NEED TO SUPPORT PARENTS SO THEY CAN GO TO WORK KNOWING THAT THEIR CHILDREN ARE BEING SUPPORTED AND NURTURED. DURING THE IS MOST CRITICAL DEVELOPMENTAL YEARS OF THEIR LIVES. BY EXPANDING THE STATE'S CAPACITY TO SERVE OUR CHILDREN AB TWENTY TWO NINETY TWO WILL ENSURE THAT A CHILD'S PATH TO SUCCESS STARTS THE SECOND HE OR SHE IS BORN. WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OUR DONNA SNEERING JR OF THE CHILDCARE RESOURCE CENTER AND NINA BOTH THE. BUT NO SAID THERE APPROVED THE OF THE CALIFORNIA CHILD DEVELOPMENT. A CHILD DEVELOPMENT ADMINISTRATORS ASSOCIATION. YOU COULD OFFER NO NEED TO PAY FOR YOU SEE CDA. AB TWENTY TWO NINETY TWO WILL INVESTING CALIFORNIA'S TALKER SYSTEM IN EFFORT TO SERVE A MORE INFANTS AND TODDLERS IN CALIFORNIA WEBER CURRENTLY SERVING ONLY ONE IN EVERY SEVEN SEVEN ELIGIBLE CHILDREN. RESEARCH SHOWS THAT THE FIRST THREE YEARS OF LIFE FOR CRITICAL TO LONG TERM BRAIN DEVELOPMENT AND THE QUALITY OF A CHILD'S ENVIRONMENT HAS A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THAT BRAIN DEVELOPMENT. AN INDEPENDENT ANALYSIS IN TWO THOUSAND AND NINE BY THE AMERICAN INSTITUTE FOR RESEARCH ESTIMATED THAT THAT TITLE FIVE GENERAL TALK HER PROGRAM WAS SIGNIFICANTLY UNDERFUNDED. AS A RESULT MANY CENTER BASED PROGRAMS HAVE CLOSED INCLUDING AT LEAST SEVENTEEN INFANT TODDLER PROGRAMS IN LA LAB SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND OTHER HIGHER EDUCATION SETTINGS. OVERALL SERVICES FOR INFANTS AND TODDLERS IN TITLE FIVE GENERAL CHILD CARE HAVE DROPPED FROM ABOUT SEVENTEEN THOUSAND AND TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT TO ONLY ELEVEN THOUSAND TODAY A DROP OF OVER THIRTY SIX PERCENT. AB TWO TWO NINE TWO ADDRESSES FOR CRITICAL NEEDS I'M FOR INFANT TODDLER CARE. IT INTERRUPTS THE LOSS OF INFANT TODDLER CLASSROOMS I'M SERVING LOW INCOME CHILDREN BY INCREASING THE RATE PAID FOR CARE. DIRECT CONTRACTORS RECEIVING FUNDING FROM THE STATE I'M RECEIVE A STANDARD REIMBURSEMENT RATE WHICH IS LARGELY INTACT ADEQUATE TO FULLY FUND HIGH QUALITY EARLY CARE AND EDUCATION PROGRAMS. AB TWENTY TWO NINETY TWO YEAR WILL INCREASE THE ADJUSTMENT FACTORS FOR INFANT TODDLER PROGRAMS TO COVER THE COST OF RUNNING HIGH QUALITY TITLE FIVE CENTER PROGRAMS. WHICH INCLUDE A ONE TO THREE INFANT ADULT TO CHILD RATIO AND A ONE TO FOUR TODDLER CHILD RATIO. INCLUDING CHILD ASSESSMENT ENVIRONMENTAL RATINGS AND MORE. AB TWO TWO NINE TWO ALSO ESTABLISHES A GRANT PROGRAM TO CREATE AND RENOVATE CLASSROOMS FOR INFANTS AND TODDLERS TO REDUCE LONG WAITING LISTS DURING THE GREAT RECESSION AT LARGE NUMBER OF CLAY INFANT TODDLER CLASSROOMS WERE CONVERTED TO PRESCHOOL CLASSROOMS. THIS GRANT WILL ALLOW PROGRAMS TO PURCHASE MATERIALS AND RENOVATE CLASSROOMS TO BE APPROPRIATE FOR INFANTS AND TODDLERS TO SERVE MORE OF THOSE POPULATION IT ALSO ADDRESSES SOME ADDITIONAL QUITE EXTORT SHORTAGES IN CHILDCARE FACILITIES. AND REVERSES THE LOSS OF LICENSED FAMILY CHILDCARE HOMES WE STRONGLY SUPPORT AB TWO TWO NINE TWO AND ARCHER BY BOTH THANK YOU. YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON THAT MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS THOMAS NARINDER WITH THE CHILDCARE RESOURCE CENTER SO AS NOT TO DUPLICATE WHAT MY COLLEAGUE AND FRIEND HAS ALREADY SAID ABOUT THE BILL I'M GOING TO FOCUS ON THE FAMILY CHILDCARE ASPECT. I'M IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT. SINCE TWO THOUSAND EIGHT CALIFORNIA'S LOST OVER THIRTY PERCENT OF ITS FAMILY CHILDCARE CAPACITY. AND FAMILY CHILDCARE IS CRITICAL BECAUSE IT MEETS THE NEEDS OF FAMILIES IN A VARIETY OF DIFFERENCE SITUATIONS INCLUDING AND RURAL COMMUNITIES NONTRADITIONAL HOURS OF CARE CULTURALLY SENSITIVE AND LINGUISTICALLY SENSITIVE. SERVICES ARE PROVIDED AND THEY CAN PROVIDE MAKE STAGE GROUPS SO THEY CAN MEET THE NEEDS OF A SINGLE FAMILY IN ONE LOCATION. ARE THESE ARE FOUNDATIONAL PROGRAMS IN OUR COMMUNITY THEY ARE IN THE NEIGHBORHOODS AND THEY ARE CONVENIENT FOR FAMILIES. AND THE LOSS OF THESE PROVIDERS IS A HUGE CHALLENGE FOR FAMILIES PARTICULARLY WITH INFANTSAND TODDLERS MOST INFANTS AND TODDLERS ARE CARED FOR IN THE SMALLER SETTINGS AND IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE MAKE SOME INVESTMENT. SO THIS BILL WOULD PROVIDE A ONE TIME INFUSION OF FUNDING INTO AN EXISTING PROGRAM CALLED THE CALIFORNIA CHILDCARE INITIATIVE PROJECT. AND IT WOULD BE TO RECRUIT AND RETAIN NEW PROVIDERS THE CHILDCARE INITIATIVE PROJECT IS AN EXISTING PROGRAM IN YOUR STATE RESOURCE AND REFERRAL AGENCIES THEY'RE OPERATING IN EVERY COUNTY IN CALIFORNIA. AND THEY HAVE A SERIES OF TRAININGS THAT ARE DESIGNED TO HELP PEOPLE GET THEIR DOORS OPENING GET INTO BUSINESS. SO WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS GIVING AN OPPORTUNITY TO.

BEFORE I GO ANY FURTHER ADDS MORE THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR OF FOR ALLOWING US THE OPPORTUNITY PRESENT AB TWENTY ONE NINETEEN WITH A GREAT APPRECIATION TO YOUR STAFF FOR AN EXCELLENT ANNOUNCES THAT CAN PROVIDES. OF REALLY WONDERFUL REVIEW OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH WITH THIS BILL BUT GIVEN THE DESPITE THAT HAVE BEEN PREPARED THAT GRAY AT HOUSES WE GIVE YOU TO EXPECT NATION ABOUT WHAT TRYING TO ACHIEVE THIS AFTERNOON. ON AB TWENTY ONE NINETEEN BUILDS ON EXISTING FOSTER CARE SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS TO BREAKDOWN MISINFORMATION AND STEREOTYPES ENSURE THAT TRANSGENDER AND GENDER NON CONFORMING USE YOUTH HAVE ACCESS TO CARE AND SUPPORT THAT THEY NEED. NOW TRANSGENDER AND GENDER NON CONFORMING USE ARE SIGNIFICANTLY OVER REPRESENTED IN CALIFORNIA'S FOSTER CARE SYSTEM. CURRENT LAW REQUIRES THAT CHILD WELFARE AGENCIES ASSESS THE HEALTH NEEDS OF ALL CHILDREN ARE IN FOSTER CARE AND ENSURE THAT THEY RECEIVE APPROPRIATE CARE AND TIMELY CARE TO ADDRESS. OF THE NEEDS OF THEIR NEEDS BY QUALIFIED PROFESSIONALS NOW UNFORTUNATELY AS YOU MIGHT IMAGINE SAMPRAS PERSONNEL CARE GIVERS AND PROVIDERS. OF MAY NOT ALWAYS. PROVIDE THAT KIND OF ACCESS BUT HE'S NOT CLOSELY COMPETENT. THIS KIND OF DENIAL OF CARE. IS REALLY DETRIMENTAL TO THESE YOUNG PEOPLE. AND IS SUBJECT THEM TO UNSTABLE PLACEMENTS FEW OPPORTUNITIES TO ACHIEVE PERMITS SEE A LACK OF ACCESS TO MEDICALLY NECESSARY CARE THE LIST GOES ON AND ON. THIS IS WHY WE'RE HERE THIS AFTERNOON. THIS BILL MAKES CLEAR OF THAT UNDER STATE LAW TO DO IT THAT I HAD THE OBLIGATION TO TRANSGENDER AND GENDER NON CONFORMING USE. IS WRITTEN INTO THE LAW RIGHT SO THAT WOULD CHILD WELFARE AGENCIES MUST SECURE ACCESS TO CLINICIANS OF WHO PROVIDE GENDER FROM TREATMENT CONSISTENT WITH ESTABLISHED STANDARDS OF CARE. IN THIS WELL I JUST TAKE A MOMENT AND MAKE SURE THAT WERE EXTREMELY CLEAR THAT WE ARE NOT CHANGING THAT THE MODES OF CONSENT FOR THIS KIND OF CARE. AS IS CURRENTLY THE CASE MANY FOSTER CHILDREN MUST BE RECEIVED THE APPROVAL OF THEIR PARENTS BEFORE THEY GET MEDICALLY NECESSARY CARE THIS BILL WOULD NOT CHANGE THAT. IN THE EVENT IN THE INSTANCES WHERE FOSTER WEAPON OF PARENTS ARE NOT CAPABLE OF PROVIDING THAT DECISION AS MANY CAN'T TODAY THERE ARE OTHER PROTOCOLS IN PLACE FOR OTHER FAMILY MEMBERS SOCIAL WORKERS COURTS. A FOSTER CHILD WELFARE AGENCIES THAT CAN PROVIDE THOSE DECISIONS THIS WOULD SIMPLY LINE THIS KIND OF CARE WITH ALL THOSE OTHER KINDS OF CARE BEGIN PARENTS CAN PROVIDE CONSENT FOR OTHER OF. ADULTS I CAN PROVIDE CONSENT FOR IT THAT'S NEEDS TO BE MADE REALLY CLEAR ON THE RECORD MADAM CHAIR. AND NOW THIS NEED TO PROVIDE A GENDER AFFIRMING CARE IS URGENT AND YOU MAY NOT KNOW THAT SO I'M TRYING TO EDUCATE YOU I'VE HAD TO LEARN A LOT MYSELF. A THAT FOR ADOLESCENTS IN PARTICULAR WITHHOLDING CARE TO THIS KIND OF TREATMENT UP PROLONGS AND REALLY EXACERBATES GENDER DYSPHORIA CONTRIBUTING TO OF VARIOUS FEATURES THAT ARE NOT IDEAL I PROVOKE A ABUSE IN STIGMATIZATION OF THESE YOUNG PEOPLE. I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE THAT WE WANT TO GIVE YOUNG PEOPLE THE BEST START IN LIFE POSSIBLE WE BELIEVE BY DOING THIS IT GIVES THEM A CHANCE TO HAVE EXACTLY THAT. GENDER AFFIRMING TREATMENT INVOLVES AN INDIVIDUALIZED APPROACH TO PERMITS A TRANSGENDER AND GENDER NON CONFORMING YOUTH AND YOUNG ADULTS TO EXPLORE AND UNDERSTAND THEIR GENDER IDENTITY AT THEIR OWN PACE. GIVING THEM THE ROOM TO FOCUS ON OTHER IMPORTANT ASPECTS OF LIFE THAT EVERY CHILD WANTS TO OR SHOULD BE DOING WHICH IS SUCCEEDING IN SCHOOL. BUILDING HEALTHY RELATIONSHIPS INNING PULLING GAUGING THE POSITIVE YOUTH DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS. AB TWENTY ONE NINETEEN WILL ESTABLISH A TRANSGENDER AND GENDER NON CONFORMING YOUTH IN FOSTER CARE CHILDREN THAT ALL OF US COLLECTIVELY HAVE RESPONSIBILITY FOR. OUR HAVE ACCESS TO MEDICALLY NECESSARY CARE AND TREATMENT FOR GENDER DYSPHORIA SAID THESE YOUNG PEOPLE CAN THRIVE. THIS AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR I HAVE TWO WITNESSES WITH ME A DOCTOR JENNIFER HASTINGS WHO IS THE DIRECTOR OF MEDICAL PROGRAMMING FOR THE GENDER SPECTRUM ORGANIZATION. WELL ON THE CHEESE DOCTOR GUY HASTINGS IS ON THE MEDICAL ADVISORY BOARD FOR UCSF CENTER OF EXCELLENCE FOR TRANSGENDER HELP. AND DOCTOR HASTINGS IS AN ASSISTANT CLINICAL PROFESSOR AND AN ASSISTANT PROFESSOR FOR USE YES THAT'S THE PARTNER AT THE DEPARTMENT OF FAMILY AND COMMUNITY MEDICINE NOW IS JUST A FRACTION OF WHAT OF WHAT DOCTOR HASTENS BEEN UP TO. ALSO WITH US THIS AFTERNOON IS NAY THINK LAUGHS GLASS BUT NATHAN IS SEVENTEEN YEARS OLD AND LIVES IN A GROUP HOME IN CULVER CITY. ON WITH YOUR INDULGENCE WILL TURN OVER THE WITNESSES. BUT CONDUCTOR HASTINGS. THANK YOU WHILE YOU. SET MY TIMER SO YOU'VE READ MY. THE THINGS I'M DOING SO I'VE BEEN PROVIDING GENDER CARE. INTENSIVELY SINCE TWO THOUSAND THREE. SUPPORTING APPROPRIATE ACCESS TO GENDER AFFIRMING CARE FOR YOUTH IN OUR FOSTER SYSTEM WILL GREATLY IMPROVE THE STABILITY AND LONG TERM HEALTH OUTCOMES FOR OUR MOST VULNERABLE CHILDREN. I HAVE SUPPORTED FOSTER YOUTH WHO WERE NOT ABLE TO ACCESS CARE IN THEIR OWN COUNTIES. THIS WAS NEVER ACCEPTABLE AND AB TWO TWENTY ONE NINETEEN S. R. OPPORTUNITY TO RIGHT A WRONG. WITHHOLDING APPROPRIATE CARE HAS WORSENED MENTAL HEALTH INCREASING INCREASING DEPRESSION ANXIETY AND SUICIDAL IDEATION. IN FACT THE NUMBERS SHOW THAT THING THAT ARE TRANSGENDER YOUTH I HAVE THE HIGHEST RATE OF SUICIDAL IDEATION AND SUCCESSFUL SUICIDE. WE HAVE EVIDENCE THAT DELAYING ARE NOT PROVIDING CARE IS NOT A NEUTRAL ACT WHICH YOU REFERRED TO. SUICIDE AND SELF HARM INCREASE WHEN TRANSGENDER PEOPLE ARE UNABLE TO ACCESS CARE. THE AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION THE AMERICAN PSYCHIATRIC ASSOCIATION THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS AND OTHER PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATIONS. RECOGNIZE THAT ACCESS TO GENDER FUHRMAN TREATMENT BOTH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND MEDICAL CARE IS CRITICAL TO THE HEALTH AND WELL BEING OF TRANSGENDER AND GENDER EXPENSES PEOPLE. WE ARE GUIDED BY STANDARDS OF CARE FROM THE WORLD PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATION OF TRANSGENDER HEALTH AND THE ENDOCRINE SOCIETY WHICH HAS A CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINE THAT WAS JUST PUBLISHED TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN. WHICH EMPHASIZE AS YOU DID AN INDIVIDUALIZED APPROACH TO CARE. ALL YOUTH NEED AND DESERVE EDUCATED KNOWLEDGABLE FROTH PROFESSIONALS. WHO CAN SUPPORT BOTH FAMILIES AND YOUTH? THE CHILDREN OF CALIFORNIA DESERVE. EVIDENCE BASED TIMELY CARE BASED ON GENDER FOR MEN PRINCIPLES. AB TWENTY ONE NINETEEN PROVIDES NEEDED SUPPORT FOR OUR MOST VULNERABLE YOUTH THANK YOU. THANK YOU. RIGHT THEN. A HIGH AND NATHAN THEY WERE INTRODUCED ME BUT. I'VE BEEN IN FOSTER CARE OF IN AND OUT WITH MY. MY FAMILY FOR ABOUT THREE YEARS.

WANTING TO START TREATMENT THEY WOULD DRIVE THEIR FEET. AND NEGLECT MY HEALTH RIGHTS. IT TOOK ABOUT A YEAR TO FINALLY BRING IT UP TO MIKE JUDGE WHICH WAS ALSO ANOTHER BRICK WALL SHE WASN'T REALLY. IN SUPPORT OF IT THE FIRST COUPLE TIMES UNTIL I PROVED THAT ICAN MAKE MY OWN DECISIONS AND. AND ALL THAT OF THEM. NOT BEING ABLE TO ACCESS. THE HEALTH CARE THAT I NEEDED BECAUSE A LOT OF. DEPRESSION AND STRESS AND I FELT VERY LIKE. UNWANTED AND JUST. JUST ALL OF THAT OF. BUT. SINCE GETTING IT OF MY MENTAL HEALTH AND EVERYTHING IT'S IMPROVED A LOT HAPPIER AND I FEEL MORE IMPORTANT AND. HAPPY THAT I'VE GOTTEN ACCESS TO SOMETHING THAT. I SHOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FROM SQUARE ONE. YEAH THANK YOU. THANK YOU. TAKE I AT HAVE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. I'M.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY MY NAME'S DOCTOR ANDRE THEM ALL. THE CALIFORNIA FAMILY PHYSICIAN AND A NINE TIME FOSTER PARENT I ALSO REPRESENT THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF PEDIATRICIANS I ASK YOU TO OPPOSE THIS BILL. FOSTER CHILDREN BE FORCED INTO WHAT I CALL A DANGEROUS PROTOCOL THAT ACTUALLY LACKS PROVEN LONG TERM SAFETY AND EFFICACY FOR A CONDITION THAT OVERWHELMINGLY GOES AWAY ON ITS OWN. THE DISTANCE RATE FOR GENDER DYSPHORIA IS EIGHTY TO NINETY FIVE PERCENT BY ADULTHOOD ACCORDING TO PROFESSIONAL LITERATURE. UNDERLYING ISSUES ARE WHAT FIRST NEED TO BE ADDRESSED THAT'S WHERE THE STATE SHOULD BE PUTTING ITS MONEY. THOSE UNDERLYING ISSUES CAN BE MANY AND FOSTER CHILDREN ARE MORE LIKELY TO HAVE THEM. EXACTLY BECAUSE THE KIND OF FAMILY DISRUPTION THE PUT THEM INTO THE SYSTEM IN THE FIRST PLACE THERE'S LOTS OF THINGS THAT NEED TO BE DEALT WITH BEFORE RUSH. THE AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION'S TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN. HANDBOOK ON SEXUALITY IN PSYCHOLOGY. PACIFIC WE CAUTIONS AGAINST WHAT THEY CALL A RUSH TO AFFIRM IN TRANSITION THAT RUNS THE RISK OF NEGLECTING INDIVIDUAL PROBLEMS THE CHILD MIGHT BE EXPERIENCING. THE RISKS AND PERMANENT CONSEQUENCES THE MINOR UNDERGOING TRANSITIONING ARE SOBERING AND IT MAKES ONE A PATIENT FOR THE REST OF ONE'S LIFE AND CHILDREN DON'T GRASP THAT YET. THE LONG TERM BENEFITS AND SAFETY FOR CHILD UNDERGOING HORMONAL THERAPY AND SURGICAL TRANSITIONING IF THEY CHOOSE TO PROCEED THAT FAR. HAS NOT BEEN DOCUMENTED IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO RECOMMEND THIS TO MINORS AS EVIDENCE BASED ARE SAFE. THE MEDICATIONS INVOLVED ARE NOT EVEN FDA APPROVED FOR THIS USE. YOU'VE HEARD MENTION OF W. PATH THE WORLD PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATION FOR TRANSGENDER HEALTH THE SPECIFIED THAT TO DATE NO CONTROLLED CLINICAL TRIALS OF ANY FEMINIZING EMASCULATED THING HORMONE REGIMENTS. HAVE BEEN CONDUCTED TO EVALUATE THEIR SAFETY SAFETY AND EFFICACY UC SAN FRANCISCO CENTER FOR EXCELLENCE OF TRANSGENDER HEALTH. SAYS THE IMPACT OF PUBERTY BLOCKERS ADMINISTERED TO TRANSGENDER YOUTH IN EARLY TO BEGIN UNDER TWELVE ALSO HAS NOT BEEN PUBLISHED. AGAIN THESE ARE FDA APPROVED FOR THAT AND THERE'S A TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN RATHER FAMOUS SWEDISH STUDY LOOKING AT THIRTY YEARS OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE FULLY TRANSITIONED AND THEY HAVE FOUND THAT THE COMPLETED SUICIDE RATE IS NINETEEN TIMES THAT. OF THE GENERAL POPULATION TO KIMBERLY SOMETHING IS BEING MISSED. I'M. REGRET IS NOT RARE BUT WHAT'S GONE IS GONE. THERE'S TWO VERY LEFT LEANING PRO GAY GROUPS YOUTH TRANS CRITICAL PROFESSIONALS AND FOURTH WAVE NOW THAT COMPLETELY OPPOSE TRANSITIONING THERAPY FOR MINORS PRECISELY BECAUSE OF THE HIGH RATES OF REGRET ANDY TRANSITIONING. A CHILD HAS THE DEVELOPING BRAIN. THE YET LACK THE CAPACITY FOR FULL ADULT DECISIONS AND THE CONSEQUENCES. AGAIN BETTER TO PLEASE WE YOU'RE DONE THE OTHER PASSED THE TIME IT HAPPENED TO ME AS AND SHOOTS THE PINK MY LIFE AND I'M TIME IT HURTS BECAUSE I. THINK YOU. KIM I'M MY NAME IS HAVE ONE VAN MOL I'M AMOUNT FOR CHILDREN AND TO. TWO OF THEM ARE FORMER FOSTER CHILDREN THAT WE'VE ADOPTED. I'M I'VE BEEN A PEDIATRIC ONLY PRINT DELIVERY NURSE TO HAVE MANY MANY FRIENDS WHO ARE FOSTER PARENTS. AND TO. PROFESSIONALS WHO WORK WITH THE FOSTER CHILDREN THAT ARE HERE TODAY BECAUSE THEY'RE WORKING. HOME WORKING WITH THEM SO I JUST WANT TO TALK TO YOU AS A MOM. SO MANY OF OUR FOSTER CHILDREN DIDN'T START LIFE AT THE NECESSARY BONDING AFFIRMATIONS THAT A MOTHER AND. FROM A MOTHER AND FATHER SINCE FOR A FIFTEEN. NON LOOKED DEMAND THE RIGHT TO JUST TELL THEM HOW BEAUTIFUL THEY ARE. AND THE WAVES. THREE UNIQUELY MADE EXPRESSES ITSELF AND HOW IMPORTANT THEY ARE TO THE WORLD. INSTEAD THEY EXPERIENCED NEGLECT. AND I'M EMOTIONAL DISCONNECTION AND EMOTIONAL PHYSICAL AND SEXUAL ABUSE. THEY COME TO US WITH BEHAVIORS. THAT REFLECT UNMET NEEDS IN TRAUMA THE OF DEFIANCE LYING STEALING WORDING EATING DISORDERS CUTTING. PROMISCUITY SUICIDE ATTEMPTS OF KNOWN WHAT WRITINGS GENDER DISCOMFITURE AND. ARE JUST BEHAVIORS FROM A CHILD WHO NEEDS TO BE LOPPED WHERE THEY'RE AT. INCOMING THEIR HEART JUST TAKES TIME. I'M. TO ME MONTHS LET THEM KNOW THEY'RE LOVED AND THERE WERE YOU WORTHY OF LOVE. I'M DEVELOPING TRUST WITH US IT JUST TAKES TIME. MOST OF THE BEHAVIORS I MENTION WILL BEGIN TO DECREASE AS TRUST AND CONNECTION AND HEALING HAPPENS. GENDER CONFUSION IS A SIMPLE THE HATE BEHAVIOR TO WORK WITH US COMPARED TO THE OTHERS ARM. WE DO OUR BEST TO PROTECT OUR FOSTER CHILDREN FROM SELF HARM AND FROM HARMING OTHERS. WE LOCK UP OUR MEDICATIONS AND OUR LIVES. FEELINGS OF GENDER CONFUSION AREN'T HARMING THEM THEY'RE IT'S NOT HARMING ANYONE ELSE. BUT THIS BILL IS REQUIRING US FOSTER MOMS TO LEAD THESE CHILDREN TO MEDICATIONS THE KNIVES BUT PERMANENTLY HARM TO REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEMS. PLEASE LET US USE THE TIME THESE CHILDREN ARE IN FOSTER CARE WITH US DEAL THEIR WHOLE BEING AND TO RESTORE TRUST AND RELATIONSHIPS. BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN VIOLATED IT'S UNDERSTANDABLE THAT THESE CHILDREN ARE NOT. WOULD WANT TO BE IN A GENDER OTHER THAN MY THIRTY IN A SAYS. BUT I. FEEL IT'S NOT OKAY TO LEAD THEM TO MEDICATIONS AND SURGERY THAT WILL PERMANENTLY AND FOREVER ALTER THEIR BODIES WHILE THEY'RE STILL A CHILD. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER WITNESSES AND OPPOSITION PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME AND YOUR. ORGANIZATION. I CAN WILLIAMS FROM BETHEL CHURCH IN REDDING AND THAT TOOK ABOUT TEN THOUSAND PEOPLE EVERY WEEKEND AND HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF FOLLOWERS WE STRONGLY OPPOSE THIS BECAUSE IT'S AN EGREGIOUS. UP AND HARM TO CHILDREN THAT AREN'T READY TO MAKE THESE KIND OF DECISIONS AND IT'S IRREVERSIBLE THANK YOU. TODD PETERSON FORMALLY MANAGER OF SEVERAL OUTPATIENT OF PSYCHIATRY AND COUNSELING CENTERS I COMPLETELY OPPOSE THIS BILL THIS IS IF PASSAGE THIS LEGISLATIVE CHILD ABUSE MY OPINION. CARL CALMLY HIS MINISTRY'S FROM FOLSOM AND. I JUST ASK YOU TO VOTE AGAINST THIS BILL THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON KEVIN SNYDER PACIFIC JUSTICE INSTITUTE CENTER CENTER FOR PUBLIC POLICY WEARING A OPPOSITION. THANK YOU. JONATHAN KELLER PRESIDENT OF CALIFORNIA FAMILY COUNCIL WE OBVIOUSLY ARE DEEPLYSYMPATHETIC CAN APPRECIATE THE ASSEMBLYMAN'S. ATTEMPTS TO REACH OUT TO FOSTER CHILDREN BUT. WE ARE ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT THAT THE PERMANENT EFFECTS OF THIS BILL ON AND THE FACT THAT IT'S IRREVERSIBLE. WHO JUST ASK IF THEY CONSIDER THE IMPACT THIS IS GOING TO HAVE ESPECIALLY ON FAITH BASED FAMILIES AND? THEIR WORK IN THE FOSTER SYSTEM AS WELL THANK YOU STRONGLY RECOMMENDED OPPOSITION. JEANNE FISHER I'VE BEEN A FOSTER-MOM AND TO DO THIS WOULD MAKE IT JUST THAT MUCH HARDER TO TRY TO BEAT OMAN. A HUSBAND DAVID FISHER. FROM CASTRO VALLEY. A. WE DID THAT FOSTER PARENTING FOR FIFTEEN MONTHS IS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TRIED TO. CORRECT SEVENTEEN YEARS THAT THIS YOU KNOW CHILD IS REJECTED. OUR MOTHER IN AND DRUG HOMES FOSTER HOMES WE FINALLY WERE TRYING TO CATCH HER UP. SO WE FIRM STRONGLY OBJECT TO THIS BILL THANK YOU. ELIZABETH WARNING FROM REDDING CALIFORNIA EQUIPPED TO LOVE I STRONGLY OPPOSES BILL. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. ANY QUESTIONS FROM OF THAT THE MEMBERS. FIRST I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BEING A FOSTER MOTHER. I THINK THAT IS ONE OF THE GREATEST THINGS THAT. ANYBODY CAN DO IS TO THE FOSTER MOTHER FOR SOME OUT TO SOMEONE WHO NEEDS THAT PERSON IN THEIR LIFE. I ALSO WANT TO COMMEND NATHAN WHO TESTIFIED EARLIER. BECAUSE I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO SEE BOTH SIDES. I THINK THAT IF SOMEONE IS ASKING TO. JUST BEAT REAFFIRMED FOR WHO THEY ARE I THINK IT IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT THAT THAT BE PROVIDED TO THEM. I. EARLIER HER CHEST TO TESTIMONY FROM A YOUNG MAN WHO WAS PART OF A GROUP CALLED BORN PERFECT. AND I THINK THAT FOR ME THAT WAS TELLING IN EVERY WAY. TO REMEMBER THAT EVERY CHILD IS BORN PERFECT. I. IT THERE WERE COMMENTS REGARDING IRREVERSIBLE. HARM. THAT IS ONE AREA IT CERTAINLY I WANT TO KNOW. WHO THE AYE AYE? IF THERE IS ANY HARM IT'S GOING TO BE. IMPOSED ON A CHILD OF COURSE WE WOULD NEVER WANT THAT. AND I CERTAIN THAT. MISTER GLORIA WHATEVER COMMENT THERE ARE THERE THE WHATEVER COMMENTS ARE REGARDING ANY HARM THAT THAT WOULD BE ADDRESSED. BUT I THINK THE CONCEPT OF PROVIDING SERVICES TO OUR YOUTH IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER COMMENT. UP THE QUESTION OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER LAURIE I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY UP BECAUSE THIS IS. AN ISSUE OF FOR FOSTER KIDS AND I JUST WANT TO. UP ASK AGAIN BECAUSE OF WHAT THE PURPOSE OF THE BILL AS. IF YOU CAN. BE DELIGHTED THANK YOU NOW CHAIR SO THE BILL IS INTENDED TO SPUR DIFFICULTY BECAUSE. MAKE IT EXTREMELY CLEAR UNDER STATE LAW THAT TREND TRANSGENDER FOSTER YOUTH AND UNTUK TRANSGENDER AND GENDER NON CONFORMING FOSTER YOU. HAVE THE RIGHT TO GENDER AFFIRMING HEALTH. IT IS WE ADDED TO WHAT IS ALREADY. ACQUIRED A RELAPSE. IN TERMS OF OTHER KINDS OF MEDICAL NECESSARY. A PROCEDURES OR OR HAVE TREATMENTS. THINGS OF THAT NATURE. SO ADDING THAT TO IT. IN THE SAME WAY THAT OTHER KINDS OF THINGS MEAN I'VE BEEN EDUCATED ON EXACTLY HOW FAR THEY HAVE TO GO TO GET. A CONSENT TO GET OTHER KINDS OF MEDICAL PROCEDURES DENTAL VISITS THINGS OF THAT NATURE. THIS WOULD JUST ADD THAT TO THOSE LIST OF THINGS THAT ALREADY. ARE SPELLED OUT AS BEING A OF PERMISSIBLE FOR A FOSTER YOUTH WHO IN THIS CASE. IS A SUBSET OF THAT THE FOSTER THE TRANSGENDER AND GENDER NON CONFORMING USE WAS SO THE WAY THAT I READ THE BILL IT THAT SAYS THAT THEY HAVE ACCESS TO BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. WHICH MEANS THAT THEY GO TO COUNSELORS UP CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG OR IF YOU CAN HELP ME THEY CAN GO TO A COUNTER AND SAY THIS IS WHAT. I'M FEELING AND. THE COUNSELOR CAN HELP THEM THIS IDENTIFY IF THE ART. CURRENTLY AND THEN ACCESS. CURRENT. MEDICAL CARE AND CURRENT PSYCHOLOGICAL APPROACHES TO GENDER CARE SO THE. WHAT WAS QUOTED FROM BY THE TESTIMONY FOR FOLKS WHO ARE OPPOSED TO THIS BILL IS ACTUALLY NOT? NOT CURRENT. AND WE HAVE SOME GOOD EVIDENCE FROM HOLLAND AND WE HAVE STUDIES FROM FORTY YEARS. THAT WAS TIME WORKING MORE WITH ADULT POPULATION AND NO DOUBT SO SO MIGHT I QUESTION IS THOUGH THE NON UP BUT I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY THAT THIS BILL. IS ONLY ADDING THE THE PIECE THAT SAYS THAT THEY HAVE. ACCESS TO BEHAVIORAL AND MEDICAL CARE THEY EVER AND MEDICAL CARE DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE'RE PUSHING DRUGS THAT WOULDN'T DOESN'T MEAN THAT'S MY CONCERN BECAUSE THE IT WASN'T SAID THAT WHERE. HARMING THE KIDS BY PUSHING THESE DRUGS. THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE PUSHING OF THE DRUGS IS I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE CLEAR ON THAT THIS IS JUST. GIVING THEM ACCESS TO THE OTHER THE HEALTH CARE THAT THE. ARE IN SOME CASES IF MAY BE APPROPRIATE TO USE MEDICATION BUT THAT'S ABSOLUTELY ON AN INVID INDIVIDUAL AFTER LEYVA HEALTH HALF HAS. THERE'S BEEN A THOROUGH. YOU KNOW EXPLORATION OR UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THE YOUTH IS EXPRESSING. CAN ALLOWS FOR. AS A MODERATE CARE THAT YOU ARE IF I'D I UNDERSTAND THE PERSPECTIVE YOU PROBABLY COME FROM ON THIS. OF THIS BILL WOULD NOT ALLOW A CHILD TO MAKE THAT DECISION ON THEIR OWN AND IT WOULDN'T BE DONE. AGAIN WITHOUT AS I MENTIONED EARLIER WITHOUT A DOUBT. CONSENT. IT WOULD NOT BE DONE ABSENT. MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL INVOLVEMENT WHICH IS NORMAL. AND AND I SAY THIS BECAUSE AND I JUST WANT TO EXPRESS THAT WE HEAR BOTH SIDES AND THOSE OF YOU THAT. I EMAILED IN THAT. MADE PHONE CALLS WE HEARD BOTH SIDES BUT I'M LOOKING AT IT AS A MOTHER AND JUST TODAY MY DAUGHTER'S SICK. AND I CAN'T BE THERE. FOR HERS HER APPOINTMENT AT FOUR FIFTEEN AND I WILL BE HERE. BUT THE. DOCTOR REQUESTED A CONSENT FORM FROM ME SO THAT. MY SITTER CAN. CONCEIT CAN TAKE HER TO THE DOCTOR AND SOLD THOSE RULES HAVE BEEN CHANGED RIGHT IF THERE'S. SOMETIMES A YOUTH WANTS TO GET MEDICAL CARE THE FOSTER OF FAMILY CAN STILL BACK. HOUSE ACTS OF. THE ABILITY TO CONSENT CORRECT. BUT THIS JUST ADDS TO THE EXISTING ARE. I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE WELL I THINK I THINK I'D NATION'S CUSTOMER HE WAS TELLING WORD TALKING ABOUT. HOW HE WOULD LIKE TO THAT ACCESS CARE ON BUT HAD TO GO THROUGH MULTIPLE HOOPS THAT DELAYED OF HIS ABILITY TO ACCESS BECKNER? THIS WE JUST BOUGHT IT VERY CLEARLY THAT HE HAS THE LEGAL RIGHT TO ACCESS THAT. BUT THAT'S NOT INDEPENDENT. THAT IS OF COURSE WITH. APPROPRIATE ADULT CONSENT AND A WITH MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS FOLLOWING A ESTABLISH GOT A PRACTICES AND IN IN A CONTINUUM OF CARE. THANK YOU ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. NO WHICH I LIKE TO CLOSE. I WOULD JUST CLOSE A MANAGER THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY I KNOW YOU'RE OFFICES HAD AND HAD ALL BUT A LOT OF WORK INTO THIS. I WOULD JUST SAY I HEARD THAT THE TESTIMONY OPPOSITION AND IF THERE'S ANYTHING YOU NEED OF OUR OFFICE WE WILL WORK WITH YOU TO MAKE SURE THIS BILL IS SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN STAND BEHIND. BUT WITH A GUARDED THE PERMANENT AND IRREVERSIBLE NATURE OF THE CONCERNS OF THOSE OPPONENTS I WOULD POINT OUT THAT BY LEAVING THESE CHILDREN IN A STATE OF GENDER DYSPHORIA WITHOUT APPROPRIATE MEDICAL TREATMENT.

A BILL THAT WOULD ALLOW THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES TO PROVIDE JUSTLY DESERVE COMPENSATION. FOR PROVIDERS OF IN HOME IN HOME SUPPORT ERVICES OR I JUST THAT'S WHO ALSO TRAINED THEIR PEERS. THIS BILL WILL ENSURE THAT THOSE I JUST AS WORKERS TO TAKE THEIR TIME TO TRAIN EXPAND AND ENHANCE. THIS WORKFORCE THAT WILL BE JUSTLY COMPENSATED FOR THEIR TIMES FOR THEIR TIME AND THEIR EFFORTS. CURRENTLY THE CALIFORNIA I TO THIS PROGRAM SERVES OVER FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND RECIPIENTS WITH THE HELP OF OVER FOUR HUNDRED AND SIX THOUSAND PROVIDERS. CALIFORNIA CAN EXPECT AN ADDITIONAL TWENTY SIX THOUSAND PROVIDERS TO BE ENROLLED IN THE PROGRAM BY THE END OF THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN FISCAL YEAR. THIS MEANS THAT PROVIDERS WILL NEED TO BE WELL TRAINED IN ORDER TO ASSIST THOSE THAT THEY CARE FOR AND PROVIDE. THEIR SERVICES WITH DIGNITY THE I JUST AS PROGRAM EXPERIENCE A TURNOVER OF TWENTY THREE POINT SIX PERCENT. EACH YEAR APPROXIMATELY SEVENTY TWO THOUSAND PROVIDERS NO LONGER OFFER THESE MUCH NEEDED SERVICES. THIS MEANS THAT MEANS THAT VULNERABLE POPULATIONS WHO DEPEND ON THIS CARE WILL NOT RECEIVE IT BECAUSE THERE WILL BE A. SHORTAGE OF CAREGIVERS TO LOOK AFTER THEM. PROVIDERS THAT. PROVIDER THE TEND TO THESE VULNERABLE. POPULATIONS AND THEIR HOMES AND HAVE LITTLE TO NO WAY TO LEARN OR OBTAIN ONE ON ONE GUIDANCE. THAT WOULD HELP THEM KEEP UP WITH THE TRAINING SANDERS AND PROVIDE BETTER ATTENTION TO THEIR CHARGES AND THOSE THAT THEY CARE FOR. AB TWENTY EIGHT SEVENTY TWO WILL PROVIDE MUCH NEEDED ASSISTANCE IN ADDRESSING THE CARING CRISIS IN OUR STATE ESPECIALLY IN THE LIGHTER. IN LIGHT OF OUR DOUBLE AGING POPULATION. AS WELL AS THE OVERALL WRITTEN RETENTION CHALLENGES EXPERIENCE BY THIS VITAL WORK FORCE THIS BILL IS SUPPORTED BY AYE TO SAYS WORKERS WHO DO THE JOB ON A DAY TO DAY BASIS.

THIS TRAINING OF ASIDE FROM WHAT IS PROVIDED FROM THE PUBLIC AUTHORITY FOR THE COUNTIES IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT OUR MEMBERS ARE OFTEN AS BY THE DEPARTMENT TO PROVIDE THESE TRAININGS.

SO THE TOTAL GRANT AMOUNT IS RAISE TWO HUNDRED PERCENT OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL AND REINSTATE THE COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT BEGINNING JANUARY. OF TWO THOUSAND AND NINETEEN. WHO OF THE BILL? I WOULD. EDU I WOULD LIKE TO ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS THAT HELPED CLARIFY THE INTENT OF THE BILL WHICH TO NOT REDUCE ANYONE'S SS I. PAYMENTS IN FUTURE YEARS. AS I S. SP GRANTS OF THE SOLE SOURCE OF INCOME FOR ONE POINT THREE MILLION LOW INCOME SEE LOW INCOME SENIORS. AND PEOPLE LIVING WITH DISABILITIES IN CALIFORNIA AND HELPS INDIVIDUALS PAY RENT BUY FOOD PAPER UTILITIES MEDICINE AND OTHER BASIC NECESSITIES. BEFORE AS I SPEAK CUTS WERE TAKEN IN TWO THOUSAND NINE THE MAXIMUM GRANT WAS ONE HUNDRED POINT SIX PERCENT OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL. AND TODAY IT IS A NINE POINT ONE PERCENT. BECAUSE THERE HAS NOT BEEN A RESTORATION OF THE S. S. B. GRANT WE HAVE ALLOWED OVER ONE MILLION ELDERLY AND DISABLED CALIFORNIA'S. TO FALL BELOW THE POVERTY LEVEL. AND OF COURSE IN CALIFORNIA BE NO THAT'S ACTUALLY DIRE POVERTY. THE CURRENT SSI SSB GRANTS ARE INADEQUATE PER PERSON TO LIVE ON ESPECIALLY GIVEN CALIFORNIA'S HIGH COST LIVING WITHOUT AN INCREASE IN SSB GRANT THESE INDIVIDUALS WAS HOMELESSNESS. AND BASS HUNGER WHICH LEADS US OBVIOUSLY TO POOR HEALTH. THE STATE HAS SAVED AN ESTIMATED TEN BILLION DOLLARS ON THESE CUTS THAT BEGAN IN TWO THOUSAND NINE. WE HAVE RESTORED EVERY MAJOR PROGRAM AND THE BUDGET EXCEPT AS S. B. GRANTS. THE GOVERNOR PROPOSES TO FULLY FUND CALIFORNIA'S RAINY DAY CASH RESERVE FUND TO THIRTEEN POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS THE LARGEST CASH RESERVES STATE HISTORY FURTHERMORE. THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE IS PROJECTING THREE POINT SIX BILLION DOLLAR BUDGET SURPLUS THIS YEAR AND I THINK WE KNOW IT'S GOTTEN TO BE MUCH LARGER THAN THAT. GIVEN THE STATE SURPLUS TIME TO RESTORE THE SSPA GRANT AMOUNT. THIS RESTORATION WILL HELP PROTECT THESE VULNERABLE POPULATIONS AND MORE IMPORTANTLY PROVIDE THEM WITH THE RIGHT TO LIVE WITH DIGNITY. NOT POVERTY. THIS IS AN INVESTMENT NOT A COST ITS SOLUTION. AT TO OUR SENIOR HOUSING CRISIS A TEACHERS HOMELESSNESS PREVENTS POOR NUTRITION OF THESE POOR HEALTH OUTCOMES THAT FURTHER STRAIN THE STATE'S OTHER SAFETY NET PROGRAMS. BY INVESTING IN OUR SENIORS AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES BY BRINGING THE SSI SP GRANT AMOUNT. TO THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL AND ULTIMATELY SAVE THE STATE MONEY AND MOST SIGNIFICANTLY WE HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT THIS IS NOT. AB AND ASK THAT'S GIVING MORE MONEY TO THIS GROUP OF THIS GROUP IS ACTUALLY SACRIFICE TO HELP US GET TO THE RECESSION TO HELP US BUILD THE SURPLUS WE HAVE. ON THE BACKS OF SENIORS LIVING IN POVERTY AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES LIVING IN POVERTY AND FOR THAT. FOR THOSE REASONS I I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE BOAT. AYE AYE I HAVE TO MY LEFT MIKE HERALD BUSES CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY AS WELL. AS A.

I'M ELIZABETH ESPINOSA REPRESENTING THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS. EXCUSE US WE RAN IN THERE YUBA COUNTY RIVERSIDE THE SPONSORS OF THE BILL OUT WE THINK A ASSEMBLY MEMBER GARCIA SO MUCH FOR. TAKING UP THIS POLICY PRIORITY I THINK THIS COMMITTEE CERTAINLY. UNDERSTANDS. THE EXTENT TO WHICH PRINT TO INCARCERATION HAD CREATES VERY PROFOUND. EXPERIENCES FOR THOSE CHILDREN OF THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS HAS IDENTIFIED CREATING A SUPPORT SET OF SUPPORTIVE SERVICES UP. FOR THIS GROUP OF YOUTH OF WE APPRECIATE HIS SUPPORT I AM GOING TO INTRODUCE CAITLYN STORM WHO IS WITH THE COUNTY AND YOU CAN PROVIDE ADDITIONAL DETAILS ON THE PROGRAM THINK THANK YOU. MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS CAITLYN STORM AND I WORK AS AN ANALYST IN THE EXECUTIVE OFFICE RIVERSIDE COUNTY. WITH THE ISSUE OF OVERCROWDING OUR LOCAL JAILS CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM REFORM. HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED AS A POLICY PARTY FOR THE COUNTY. FURTHER RESEARCH HAS SHOWN CHILDREN CURSORY TO PARENTS WHICH I'LL REFER TO AS CIP. EXPRESS PARTICULAR VULNERABILITY TO BECOME INCARCERATED COMPARED TO PURSUE NOT HAVE INCARCERATED PARENTS. AS A RESULT MY COLLEAGUE FORMER ASSEMBLYMEMBER BRIGHTNESS INDIAN I HAVE DEVELOPED A PROGRAM TO REDUCE TRAUMA INDUCED RESILIENCY IN THE CIP POPULATION. IN ORDER TO REDUCE HE NEGATIVE OUTCOMES THEY OFTEN EXPERIENCE INCLUDING AN INCREASE SUSCEPTIBILITY TO FUTURE INCARCERATION AND CRIMINAL JUSTICE INVOLVEMENT. ABOUT A YEAR AND A HALF AGO THE RIVERSIDE COUNTY EXECUTIVE OFFICE BEGIN EXPLORING THE IDEA. OF A SOCIAL IMPACT BOND AS A MEANS TO DESIGN AND FUND PROGRAMS. IN MAY TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN. WE APPLIED IN A PERSIMMON APPLICATION TO NATIONWIDE COMPETITION OUTLINING OUR IDEA FOR WRAPAROUND SERVICES PROGRAM FOR CIP. RIVERSIDE COUNTY AND THE YALE CHILD CENTER STUDY WERE SELECTED AS THE TO A WORD THESE TO RECEIVE TECHNICAL SERVICES ASSISTANCE FROM SOCIAL FINANCE INC. AND TOWARDS THE DEVELOPMENT OF AMERICANS RECORD. WHICH IS ONE VARIATION OF THE SOCIAL IMPACT BOND. SINCE THEN WE HAVE BEEN THOUGHTFULLY DESIGNING A PROGRAM USING A TWO GENERATIONAL HOLISTIC HEALTH APPROACH. THAT WILL PROVIDE APPROPRIATE EVIDENCE BASED RESOURCES AND SERVICES THAT HAVE PROVEN TO POSITIVELY IMPACT CHILDREN AND FAMILIES. WE HAVE FOUND THAT TO TRULY IMPROVE OUTCOMES FOR CIP. WE NEED TO ADDRESS MULTIPLE AREAS OF HEALTH AS OUTLINED IN AB THREE ZERO ZERO SEVEN. THESE INCLUDE PHYSICAL EMOTIONAL MENTAL AN OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL. ADDITIONALLY. ACTUALLY MAKE A POSITIVE AND LASTING IMPACT IN THE LIVES OF THESE CHILDREN WE NEED TO CONNECT THEIR CARETAKERS TO RESOURCES AND SERVICES THAT REDUCE STRESS AND IMPROVE STABILITY. OUR GOAL AND EXPECTATION IS THAT THE CAP PROGRAM WILL PRODUCE A NUMBER OF POSITIVE OUTCOMES. JUST INCREASED POSITIVE PARENT CHILD INTERACTION. REDUCE ANXIETY DEPRESSION AND PTSD SYMPTOMS AMONG AFFECTED CHILDREN. AS WELL AS ENHANCED HOME. M. SAFETY AND PARENTAL SUPERVISION AMONG OTHERS. OUR HOPE IS THAT WITH POSITIVE INTERVENTIONS WE CAN STRENGTHEN THE RESILIENCY OF THIS PHONE OF A POPULATION. HELP THEM ACHIEVE LONG TERM SUCCESS AND WELL BEING AND PLACE THEM ON A POSITRON AWAY FROM INCARCERATION. WE HOPE THIS PROGRAM WILL SERVE AS A MODEL FOR OTHER COUNTIES STATES AND COUNTRIES THAT THE NEEDS OF CIP ARE BETTER UNDERSTOOD AND ADDRESSED. I WISH TO EXPRESS MY SINCERE APPRECIATION TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER GARCIA FOR AUTHORING THIS MEASURE. RESPECTFULLY REQUEST THE COMMITTEES A VOTE I VOTE ON AP THREE ZERO ZERO SEVEN.

BILLS OF DOT ISSUE BILL AS A FOUR ZERO VOTE AT MOVES ON TO THE. ASSEMBLY FLOOR. THANK YOU. A ASSEMBLYMAN RICHARD WELCOME. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR SAN A MEMBERS I'D JUST LIKE TO START OUT BY THANKING THE COMMITTEE'S A STAFF AND THE DAM. CHAIR TO WORK WITH MY STAFF FOR THE. A AMENDMENT OF. DEFINITELY BE HAPPY TO ACCEPTING THE COMEY HE'S FOR AMENDMENT. AB THIRTY EIGHTY EIGHT REQUIRED ALL CONTINUING CARE RETIREMENT COMMUNITY. INCLUDING BILLS AND SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY. TO STUDY. OF BIG FINANCIAL RISK SUCH AS THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE COSTS. INDIRA FACILITY TO BETTER PLANE PLAN FOR THAT EARNED HIM. BEING IN IMPENDING COST AND LIMITED FINANCIAL IMPACT TO DO RESIDENTS. THE REQUIREMENT IN MY BILL IS DIFFERENT AND THE CURRENT FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE STATEMENT A DISK DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS. AND I JUST GO TO A LOT OF IT DEEPER INTO MORE FACTORS. A DEBT COULD POSE FINANCIAL RISKS TO FAILURE A POTENTIAL RESIDENTS. DOES LIVING IN THE C. C. R. C. HAVE PUT UP A LOT OF EFFORT INTO PLANNING FOR THEIR RETIREMENT. AND TO ENSURE THAT THEY HAVE ENOUGH MONEY FOR DEER. LATER YEARS WELL I'M FACILITY OWNER NOT PLAYING FOR. DO NOT PLAN FOR FUTURE MAINTENANCE COSTS SUCH AS FILLING EQUIPMENT AND OR A LEAKY MOVE FOR AND AND AND THEY PUT IT RESIDENTS AT RISK. OF MONTHLY FEE INCREASES WHEN REPAIR OR REPLACEMENT NEED TO HAPPEN. IT IS. GENERALLY CHEAPER TO ADDRESS THOSE MAINTENANCE ISSUE. EARLIER. OWN DREADED IN A LATER. SO THIS BILL WILL. REQUIRED THEM TO A HOW TO OF MORE REGULAR CHECKUPS EVERY FIVE YEARS. AND TO TO HAVE A BETTER. KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE BILL FUTURE OF POTENTIAL OF CULTURAL PER REQUIREMENT. AM I MY MY BILL PROTECT CONSUMERS AND ALSO PROMOTE GOOD BUSINESS PRACTICE. IN TO ATTEMPTED. THIS AFTERNOON WITH ME HERE TODAY IS WHOM MORE THAN COVER HALL AND MARGARET GRIFFIN'S REPRESENING CALL THE FUNNIER CONTINUING CARE RESIDENTS ASSOCIATION. NO TO SPONSOR OF THE BILL. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. I'M MARGARET CRESSMAN PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA CONTINUING CARE RESIDENTS ASSOCIATION OR CAL CRA. AND A RESIDENT OF UNIVERSITY RETIREMENT COMMUNITY CCRC IN DAVIS. CALPERS THE SOUL ORGANIZATION REPRESENTING SENIORS LIVING IN C. C. R. SEASON CALIFORNIA. OUR MISSION IS TO ENHANCE THE QUALITY OF LIFE AND FINANCIAL SECURITY OF CCRC RESIDENTS. AND WE'RE PROUD TO SPONSOR AB THIRTY EIGHTY EIGHT. C. C. R. C.'S OFFER RESIDENTS A CONTINUUM OF CARE FROM INDEPENDENT LIVING THROUGH ASSISTED LIVING. USUALLY ALSO DEMENTIA CARE AND FINALLY SKILLED NURSING. RESIDENTS PAY BOTH AN ENTRANCE FEE TO MOVE INTO A CCRC AND THEN AN ONGOING MONTHLY FEE. WHICH IS SUBJECT TO INCREASES AT THE DISCRETION OF OUR PROVIDER. THESE FEES COVER EVERYTHING FROM MANAGEMENT CARE AND SERVICES THROUGH MAINTENANCE AND UPKEEP OF THE FACILITY. CURRENT LAW REQUIRES THAT ACTUARIAL STUDIES BE OBTAINED EVERY FIVE YEARS BUT ONLY BY C. C. R. C.'S THAT OFFER TYPE A OR LIFE CARE CONTRACTS. WHICH ACCOUNT FOR ONLY TENOF THE OVER ONE HUNDRED CC OUR SEASON CALIFORNIA. WE BELIEVE THAT THE STATISTICAL MODELING IN FINANCIAL RISK ASSESSMENT ANALYSES PROVIDED BY AN ACTUARY. ARE VALUABLE TOOLS IT SHOULD BE UTILIZED BY ALL C. C. R. C.'S IN THEIR LONG TERM PLANNING. REGARDLESS OF THE TYPE OF CONTRACT THEY OFFER. ACTUARIAL STUDIES GENERATE DATA THAT QUANTIFIES LONG TERM LIABILITIES AND IDENTIFIES OPTIONS FOR MEETING THEM. IT ALSO PROVIDES INFORMATION RELATIVE TO THE ABILITY TO MEET FUTURE CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND TO SET PRICES. FOR SHORT AND LONG TERM HOUSING AND CARE OPTIONS. WITHOUT AN ACTUARIAL STUDY. A CCRC MAY APPEAR FINANCIALLY STABLE IN THE SHORT TERM. YET STILL FACE SIGNIFICANT THREATS TO ITS LONG TERM VIABILITY. WHO CAN YOU WRAP UP PLEASE JUST AS ACTUARIAL STUDIES FOCUS ON THE BUSINESS SIDE OF AN OPERATION THERE IS ALSO A NEED TO ADDRESS THE PHYSICAL PLANT AND EQUIPMENT OF THE FACILITY? IGNORING OR DEFERRING MAINTENANCE ISSUES GUARANTEES THAT NGUYEN FINALLY DISCOVERED THE EVENTUAL REPAIRERS WILL ONLY BE MORE SEVERE AND EXPENSIVE. THEREFORE IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT CCRC USE. REGULARLY OBTAINED A MAINTENANCE AND REPAIR REVIEW OF THEIR IMPORTANT BUILDING SYSTEMS. THE FINANCIAL BURDEN OF DEFERRED MAINTENANCE AND POOR PLANNING FALLS ON THE SHOULDERS OF RESIDENTS IN THE FORM OF FEE INCREASES. THAT ARE HIGHER THAN WOULD HAVE BEEN REQUIRED HAD THESE ISSUES BEEN PROMPTLY IDENTIFIED AND DEALT WITH. HAVING THE INFORMATION. PROVIDED BY THESE LONG TERM PLANNING TOOLS WILL ALLOW MANAGEMENT TO BE MORE FULLY AWARE. OF THE STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES OF THEIR CCRC AS A WHOLE. AND TO BE MORE PROACTIVE AND EFFECTIVE IN ALLOCATING RESOURCES TO MEET THOSE NEEDS. ENSURING THAT BOTH BUSINESS AND THE PHYSICAL PLANT ARE SOUND. HELPS BOTH MANAGEMENT AND PRESIDENT'S MANAGE THE COSTS INVOLVED. IN IT ENSURES THE PROTECTION OF THE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS RESIDENTS HAVE MADE IN THEIR CCR SCENES. THAT IS WHY A. B. THIRTY EIGHTY EIGHT IS SO IMPORTANT TO US. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND WIENER CHAIR IPHONE THANK YOU. THANK YOU MORTON CARB ALTERNATIVE STRATEGY GROUP ON BEHALF OF CAL CROWDS WELL IT ALL JUST BE BRIEF AND I THINK THE CONSULTANT FOR A VERY THOROUGH ANALYSIS ON THIS BILL IN JUST ONE UPON ADD TWO POINTS. ON THE NOTION THAT CCRC PROVIDERS THAT DON'T OFFER TAIPEI CONTRACTS DON'T SHARE THE SAME RISK AS OTHER CCRC PROVIDERS. I LIKE TO BE VERY CLEAR ABOUT ALL THESE YEARS HE'S MAKE THE SAME UNDERLYING PROMISE REGARDLESS OF WHAT TYPE OF CONTRACT THE OFFER. TO ACCOMMODATE RESIDENTS AS THEIR HEALTHCARE NEEDS CHANGE. ALL CCRC IS MAINTAIN INDEPENDENT LIVING ESOS ASSISTED LIVING AND SKILLED NURSING UNITS ON CAMPUS AND ALSO USE YOUR SEATS PROMISE TO ACCOMMODATE THE RESIDENTS AS THEY AGE. ALL CCRC SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO USE STRATEGIC PLANNING TOOLS THAT HELP TO ENSURE THAT THEY CAN UPLOAD THE PROMISES THAT THEY'VE MADE TO THE RESIDENTS I'M HERE TO ANSWER ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS AND I URGE YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU ANY OTHER WITNESSES THE SUPPORT. I AM A RESIDENT OF CCRC IN DAVIS. AND I STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS THANK YOU. MY NAME IS STUART GROHMAN I AM A RESIDENT OF A CCRC. IN CARMICHAEL CALIFORNIA. AND ALSO A RESIDENT. A REPRESENTATIVE OF RESIDENTS THERE AND WE ARE IN FAVOR OF THIS BILL. EVEN THOUGH WE WISHED THAT THE. REPLACEMENT. AND. REPAIR STUDY WOULD INCLUDING FINANCIAL. RESERVE FOR THAT THANK YOU THANK YOU. NAME IS ROBERT SWENSON. I'M A RESIDENT OF THE UNIVERSITY RETIREMENT COMMUNITY. AND DAVIS. AND I STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS BILL THANK YOU. I'M WHILE HOGAN LIVE AT THE ESCHATON VILLAGE CARMICHAEL ALONG WITH FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY OTHER SENIORS. OUR OWNER PROVIDER DOES NONE OF THE THINGS CURRENTLY. HER REQUIRED BY THIS BILL. AS A RESULT MAINTENANCE AND REPLACEMENT IS INADEQUATE WE NEED THESE PROVISIONS THANK YOU THANK YOU. I'M DAVID PREDATOR I'M A RESIDENT OF CCRC AND DAVIS AND I STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS BILL THANK YOU. I'M PRESCOTT WILLIAMS PRESIDENT OF. CCRC IN DAVIS I SUPPORT THIS BILL. THANK YOU. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION DAPHNE MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS. JET HAMPTON ON BEHALF OF LEADING EDGE CALIFORNIA OUT ROUTE REGRETTABLY IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. TODAY I FIRST AND FOREMOST I WOULD LIKE TO THINK THE THE AUTHORS OFFICE AND THE SPONSORS FOR. WILLING TO HAVE A DISCUSSION ABOUT THE PROVISIONS OF THIS BILL. I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO THINK THE CHAIR AND THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THE SIGNIFICANT WORK THAT THEY. PUT INTO THE ANALYSIS OF THE OF THE BILL. VERY MUCH APPRECIATED. AGAIN LEADING EDGE CALIFORNIA IS A. ASSOCIATION REPRESENTS REPRESENTS NOT FOR PROFIT A SENIOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING CARE AND SERVICE PROVIDERS TO AT THE STATE. WE HAVE OVER FOUR HUNDRED PROVIDERS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. WITH THE SIGNIFICANT OUT COMPONENT OUR MEMBERSHIP MADE UP OF NOT FOR PROFIT C. C. R. C.'S. AGAIN A PORTION WE ARE RIDLEY POSTS THE BILL. AS IT AS IT CURRENTLY IS UP PRIMARILY BECAUSE WE DO THINK THAT THE THE PROVISION TO HAVE NATURAL STUDY THROUGH ALL SIX YEARS SEE TYPES IS UNNECESSARY. AND UNDULY EXPENSIVE FOR. CCRC THAT DO NOT PROVIDE THAT I DON'T HAVE THE SAME FINANCIAL OBLIGATION FINANCIAL RISK. I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO TO TO DELINEATE BETWEEN THE TIE CONTRACT TYPES WHO WERE DISCUSSING C. C. R. C.'S. PRIMARILY AT THE TYPE A CONTRACT ARE NOT ONLY INCLUDE THE HIGHER ENTRANCE FEE WITH HIGHER MONTHLY FEES. BUT THESE FEES CANNOT BE MODIFIED SIGNIFICANTLY ON A ON A YEAR TO YEAR BASIS. FURTHERMORE THE CCRC IS OBLIGATED TO TAKE CARE OF THAT INDIVIDUAL FOR LIFE REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY OUT SPEND. THEIR EXISTING RESOURCES INCLUDING THEIR ENTRANCE FEE AND A MONTHLY FEES. SO FOR INSTANCE IF IF A RESIDENT AT HAVE SIGNIFICANT LONG TERM CARE NEEDS NEEDED. MAXIM HEALTHCARE SERVICES AT THE CCRC. ROOM REGARDLESS IF THEY HAD THE ABILITY TO PAY OR MEET THE MONTHLY FEE OBLIGATION THE CCRC IS STILL RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT CARE FOR THE FOR THE INDIVIDUAL. THIS IS WHY CURRENTLY. TYPE ES CONTRACTS REQUIRE NATURAL STATE BECAUSE THAT THE RISK BORN BY THE CCRC. IS MUCH MORE SIGNIFICANT WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT TAIPEI CONTRACT. THE OTHER CONTRACT TYPES INCLUDING TYPE B. AND TYPE C. CONTRACTS ARE MODIFIED VERSIONS OF A CONTRACT TYPE. WHERE IN INFANCY IS STILL PAID AND MONTHLY FEES ARE STILL PAID TYPICALLY HAVE A LOWER RATE BUT THESE MONTHLY FEES CAN BE CHANGED DRAMATICALLY? SHOULD THE INDIVIDUAL NEED ACCESS TO ADDITIONAL HEALTHCARE COSTS. SO. YOU KNOW WE WE WE CERTAINLY FEEL THAT THAT. REQUIRING CCRC TO. CONDUCT NATURAL STUDY WHEN THEY DON'T HAVE. A SIGNIFICANT RISK AND THAT TYPE A CONTRACT DOES IS UNNECESSARY IS EXPENSIVE AND. VERY LIKELY THOSE COSTS WILL BE PASSED ONTO THE RESIDENTS ARE JUST A MINUTE OR COMMUNITIES LIKE TO AVOID SELF. I HOPE THAT BEING SAID I AM WE ARE UNFORTUNATE OPPOSITION THINK IT. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS HEATHER HARRISON WITH THE CALIFORNIA SYSTEM LIVING ASSOCIATION WE PRO REPRESENTS. A CONTINUING CARE RETIREMENT COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE I WANT TO ECHO THE COMMENTS. OF MY COLLEAGUE I I WON'T BE REPETITIVE. BUT I DO WANT TO STRESS A COUPLE POINTS ITS ITS THE NATURE OF THE THAT TYPE A CONTRACT THAT WARRANTS THE ACTUARIAL STUDY THAT'S WHY THE LEGISLATURE. AND THE STATE HAS SET THE SYSTEM UP TO FOCUS ON THAT THE OTHER CONTRACT TYPES DON'T CARRY THAT SAME TYPE OF. OF RISK THAT THE ACTUARIES STUDY WHEN THEY DO THOSE KINDS OF REPORTS. THE FINANCIAL ASPECTS OF C. C. R. C.'S ARE ALL READY HIGHLY REGULATED THERE'S A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF TRANSPARENCY. WITH. AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND KEY INDICATOR REPORTS REPORTED ANNUALLY TO THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES AND ARE AVAILABLE ON THE STATE'S WEBSITE ARE AVAILABLE TO RESIDENTS. DSS REVIEWS THAT INFORMATION AND IF THERE IS. CAUSE FOR CONCERN THEY TAKE CORRECTIVE ACTION AND DSS IS DOING ITS JOB. WE APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATIONS WE'VE HAD WITH THE AUTHORS OFFICE AND. THE ALL THE WORK THAT THE COMMITTEE STAFF HAS DIED APPRECIATE THE AMENDMENTS. UNFORTUNATELY THEY DO NOT REMOVE OUR OPPOSITION. THE THE MAINTENANCE AND RUB ON REPAIR REVIEW. IT AGAIN APPRECIATE THE SOME OF THAT THE CHANGES IN THE CONVERSATIONS WE'VE HAD BUT THE. THIS TYPE OF INFORMATION IS ALREADY AVAILABLE. MUCH OF IT THE ISSUE COMES UP DURING THE BUDGETING PROCESS IN IN CONVERSATIONS RESIDENTS ARE ENCOURAGED DURING THAT BUDGET PROCESS TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS WITH THESE COMMUNITIES ABOUT. ABOUT THEIR HOME WHERE THEY LIVE IT'S IMPORTANT TO THE PROVIDERS AS WELL THAT THEY HAVE A GOOD EXPERIENCE AND THAT THE FINANCIAL HEALTH AND THE. UPKEEP IS PROVIDED WE DON'T SEE THIS BILL. UP REALLY ENHANCING THAT PROCESS SO I'M FOR THOSE REASONS WE REMAIN OPPOSED. THANK YOU ANY OTHER UP WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. K. HEARING NONE ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. CHOI. AND THANK YOU ARE THROUGHOUT THE EMPHASIS OF VARIOUS SENSITIVE LA NOW QUESTIONS OF THAT THOUGH YOU ARE PRESENTING. AS WE HAVE FACED SO MANY PEOPLE WHO WOULD THAT RELY ON OUR. ASSISTED LIVING FACILITIES SAID THIS ARE VERY IMPORTANT. WITH THE CURRENT CONDITION. WHAT THE? WITHOUT THIS A CORRECTIVE MEASURE. WAS THERE ANY BIG PROBLEM. THAT'S NUMBER ONE QUESTION. NUMBER TWO HOW MUCH DOES IT COST THE ACTUARIAL STUDY IS SALVO I'M SURE THE SO WHAT COSTLY IS TO NOT EVERY YEAR BUT THE ONCE IN THIRTY YEARS THAT THE SO SOUND SO REASONABLE WHEN I LISTEN TO YOU. BUT WHEN I LISTEN TO OPPOSITION. I MEAN AND YOU ARE BUDGET THE PRESENTATION WILL TAKE CARE OF AND THEN ALSO. THE OWNERS OR OPERATORS SELF THAT FACILITY. WELL TYPICALLY. IN A RESERVE US SOME FUN STUFF FOR MAINTENANCE FUNDS ETCETERA. SO WHY DO WE HAVE TO OVER REGULATE. YOU KNOW THEIR OWN PROPERTY. IT'S SORT OTHER SORTS OF COOPER QUESTIONS THAT I HAVE. A GOOD THING THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION THE AYE YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO ANSWER. TWO YOU OR HOW MUCH OF A COST TO DO THE ACTUAL RE STUDY. BUT QUITE I CAN. TO SHARE WITH YOU WHAT THE ADDITIONAL COST OF THIS BILL. IS PRETTY MUCH ASKED THE. DO YOU DO OWNER TO DO A LOT LIKE I. REALLY GOOD GENERAL INSPECTION OF THE BUILDING TO ASSESS DO. THE DAVID COULD DO TO REMOVING CONDITION OR SOME MAJOR EQUIPMENT AND IT'S AN EIGHTY HEHE AIR CONDITIONING AND SO ON AND SO FORTH. AND SO. BUT I DON'T THINK WORK AT EVERY FIVE YEARS. AND YOU WOULD REALLY. I DON'T BELIEVE WHAT AT ANY ADDITIONAL COSTS TO WHAT'S ALREADY. MANDATED BY THE STATE LAW. IF FIVE I COULD JUST ADD AS WELL-AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND. ON THE POINT OF THE. THE COST WITH THE BILL DISS AND WITH THE AMENDMENTS THAT WE'VE ACCEPTED IT SPREADS THOSE COSTS OUT OVER A FIVE YEAR PERIOD SO. SPREADING THAT CAUSE OUT OVER A FIVE YEAR PERIOD WE ANTICIPATE THAT ANY COST TO THE RESIDENTS WOULD BE NOMINAL. DOES THAT AS IT WOULD KINDA WORK OUT IN THE BUDGET AND. JUST ONE POINT TO THE QUESTION ABOUT THE ANNUAL BUDGETS AND HOW THAT THAT LOOKS AT THE. THE FINANCES OF THE FACILITY. I THINK THESE ARE TWO KIND OF SEPARATE THINGS ANNUAL BUDGETS AND AUDITS LOOK AT. THE FORMER FOR THE FORMAL FIND ARE THE YEAR BEHIND US RIGHT THEY LOOK AT HOW WE DID THIS YEAR HOW THE FINANCES LOOKED. YOU KNOW WHERE WE'RE AT RIGHT NOW AN ACTUARIAL STUDIES ARE FORWARD THINKING AND THEY LOOK AT PROJECTIONS OF. POPULATION PROJECTIONS COST PROJECTIONS ON. BECAUSE SEVERAL OTHER THINGS THAT HELP ANALYZE THE FORWARD LIABILITY THE FORD FINANCIAL LIABILITIES THAT THEY'VE CCRC MAC MIGHT FACE DOWN THE ROAD. THOSE THOSE RISKS ARE WAY. INHERENTLY WINDOWS HEAD IF THE CCRC ISN'T PLANNING AHEAD FOR THOSE KIND OF THINGS. THE HEAD OF THAT IS FINE IS A FINANCIAL BURDEN ON THE RESIDENTS BECAUSE AS WE KNOW. THE RESIDENTS THERE AT THEIR MONTHLY FEES CAN INCREASE BASED ON OPERATION COSTS INCREASE IN OTHER INCREASES THAT SYNTHESISER PROVIDER. HAS AND IF THEY HAVE AN ANTICIPATED THOSE THEN THAT INCREASED MAY FALL ON THE RESIDENTS SO WE SEE THAT THE FINANCIAL BENEFITS ABOUT FAR OUTWEIGHING. ON ANY NOMINAL COST THAT THE ACTUARIAL STUDY WOULD WOULD HAVE ON THAT RESIDENTS. SOME FINAL QUESTIONS ARE. A LONG TIME AGO WAS OPEN UPON A TIME I SERVED AS A. THOSE SMALL LOW HOMEOWNER ASSOCIATION BOARD MEMBER. OF THOSE ARE ALWAYS TO ANNUAL. AND A MANAGEMENT COMPANY GIVEN MONTHLY THAT REPORT COCA. AND THAT THEY UP COMMONSENSE A INCLUDED DATA. HE OUT REPLACEMENT COST AND THE RESERVATIONS. AND THE. THE STREET OF A READ PAVEMENT DATA ETCETERA ETCETERA. SEWER ANY A AND T. WHY THEY WOULD NOT THE INCLUDE PROJECT THAT THE STATE HAVE TO BE COSTLY. SOUNDTRACKER ACTUARIAL STUDY SALVO. I DON'T KNOW PROBABLY AND THE LIST SUPPORT SO IT IT. IT HAS SAY SOMEONE VALUE ONCE YOU SUBMIT TO DR SOCIAL SERVICE DEPARTMENT THE. WORD SOMEBODY STUDY AND THEY. AND A AND ARE THERE HAS TO BE SOMEBODY STUDY THAT FACTORY OR STUDIES OUT OF. AND DOES SOME SOME PROBLEMATIC ISSUE FOUND THE. OF IN THAT STUDY SOMEONE HAS TO FOLLOW UP. P. ACCORDING TO YOUR REPORT THAT THIS IS NOT SUFFICIENT ON YOUR BODY THAT. THE. DO YOU HAVE A SUCH A MECHANISM SO THAT'LL BE AMADOR INCREASE OUT OF OUR. AT JUST OF FOR DOING IT THIS OUT FOR I MEAN. IT HAS TO HAVE IT HAS TO COST SOME ACTION FROM THAT STUDY. IF I HAD RECEIVED A STAR ACT OREOS ACTIVITY JUSTIFY LIT WALKED Y. SOMEBODY HAS TO STUDY. AND THE COME UP WITH THE HEY YOU PASS. NO URINE PASS IN SOME FOLLOW UP ACTION. GOOD IF I IF I MAJOR THE SO THAT ACTUARIAL STUDY WOULD BE PROVIDED ONCE IT WAS FINISHED BY THE ACTUARY PROVIDED TO THAT PROVIDERS BUT IT WOULD BE GIVEN TO THE PROVIDERS BOARD AND THAT BODY WOULD BE ABLE TO ANALYZE THAT AND LOOK OUT AND. AND USE THOSE PROJECTIONS IN THEIR IN THEIR BUDGETING AND IN THEIR DECISION MAKING MOVING FORWARD AS THE CCRC BOARD. A SO SO THAT MINNESOTA IN ADDITION TO THE OPERATORS SO ADDITIONAL COST TO PUT A STUDY. BUT THE SORT OF SERVICE DEPARTMENT ITSELF FOR MONITORING. WOULD HAVE TO INCREASE. IT'S NOW AND THE FOLLOW UP ACTIONS SO HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT THAT THE COST OF THE SOCIAL DEPARTMENTS SOCIAL SERVICE DEPARTMENT OPERATION COST HOW MUCH DATA COOPER. SO THE BOARD RIGHT NOW RECEIVES THESE REPORTS THE ACTUARIAL STUDIES FROM ANY CCRC THE OFFERS THAT TYPE A CONTRACT TO THEIR ALREADY REQUIRED TO DO ACTUARIAL STUDIES. SO THIS WOULD JUST FALL IN THAT SAME LINE IN THE SENSE THAT LOOK AT THOSE ANNUAL REPORTS IN THE FILE THEM. THERE'S NO. THERE'S NO PASS OR FAIL AYE AYE GUESSES BUT A GOOD WAY OF DESCRIBING THAT THE IF THE. THE DEPARTMENT DOES A PASS OR FAIL A CCRC BASED ON WHAT THE ACTUARIAL STUDY. STUDY COMES BACK WITH. IT'S JUST THAT IT'S A TOOL THAT THE CCRC COULD USE IN THEIR FUTURE PLANNING AND AND AND AND THEY'RE PLANNING IN OUTLOOK. AS THEY LOOKED. BUDGETS DOWN THE ROAD. THANK YOU. THANK YOU OF ANY OTHER COMMENTS OKAY THANK YOU I HAVE A MOTION A BY DR ARAMBULA AND THE SECOND BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER RADIUS AND THE RECOMMENDATION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO AGING AND LONG TERM CARE. CAN CALL THE ROLL PLEASE. RUBIO AYE REVEAL AYE DOCTOR CHOI. ON NOT VOTING DUCKS CHOI NOT VOTING ARAMBULA. ARAMBULA AYE MAIENSCHEIN. FRANCE. REYES AYE STONE. STONE AYE THURMOND. WHAT IS YOUR QUE THE BILL'S OUT AND IT'S ALL GOING TO AGING AND LONG TERM CARE THANK YOU? YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER EGGMAN WELCOME ASSEMBLY MEMBER THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU AND GOOD AFTERNOON. START OFF BY THINKING OF THE COMMITTEE FOR THEIR WORK IN ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS. HUMAN TRAFFICKING HAS CLAIMED COUNTLESS LIVES IT'S BEEN AN ISSUE THAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON IN THIS BUILDING FOR. A COUPLE YEARS NOW. WE WEREN'T MAKING MUCH OF A DENT YET AND WE KNOW THAT THERE'S MILLIONS OF KIDS OUT THERE ARE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS A STATE HAS COMMITTED. AND ONE IS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE DONE NOW IS WE'VE WE DECRIMINALIZE IT WOULD SAY THAT THAT KIDS CAN'T BE THAT HARD WITH THE CRIME IF THEY'RE UNDER. EIGHTEEN WHICH WE ALL AGREE WITH BUT AT THE SAME TIME. WHAT WE PROVIDING FOR THESE KIDS AND IT IS ONE THING TO BE ABLE TO SAVE SOMEBODY FROM A REALLY BAD HUMAN TRAFFICKING SITUATION? BUT IF WE DON'T HAVE REALLY GOOD SERVICES THAN TO TREAT THEM WHEN THEY COME OUT THESE ARE. KIDS SOMETIMES OF BRAINS LOOK LIKE THEY'VE BEEN IN A WAR ZONE BECAUSE OF THE MULTIPLE TRAUMA IS THAT THEY'VE ENCOUNTERED SOMETIMES FROM MULTIPLE YEARS. AND SO WHAT WHAT WE DO KNOW IS THAT COUNTIES ARE DOING IT IN DIFFERENT KINDS OF FASHIONS. DOM WHAT WE DO KNOW IS THAT SOME ARE MORE EFFECTIVE THAN OTHERS A BUT WE DON'T HAVE A A COMMON WAY TO COLLECT THAT DATA AND BE ABLE TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT'S WORKING WHAT'S NOT AND HOW DO WE DO USE BEST. A PRACTICES. SO THIS SIMPLY SAYS THAT THE A NDSS DID A STUDY LAST YEAR THAT KIND OF SENT OVER THERE SOME THERE SOME GAPS HERE AND THERE AND AROUND. TO THIS BILL SIMPLY SAYS THAT THEY WILL DO A REPORT TO US THE LEGISLATURE WHEN A BEST PRACTICES WATER DIFFERENT COUNTIES DOING. AND AND AND WHAT MORE DO WE NEED TO DO.

THAT DESPERATELY NEED A IN LIGHT OF THE FACT THAT WE HAVE A DOCUMENTED LONG WAY TO GO THE APPROACH TAKEN BY THIS BILL IS A MEASURE ONE. IT SIMPLY REQUIRES THAT THIS LEGISLATURE BE KEPT ABREAST OF COUNTY PROGRESS. A IN MEETING. THE GOALS SET OUT IN FEDERAL LAW AND STATE LAW. AYE AND ENCOURAGES COUNTIES AND THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES TO IDENTIFY AND IMPLEMENT. BEST PRACTICES BY A DATE CERTAIN. OBVIOUSLY ONE OF THE MOST TRAGIC POPULATIONS IN OUR STATE THEY DESERVE OUR ATTENTION. AND SUPPORT AND ON THEIR BEHALF I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR I'VE OF. THANK YOU ANY OF THE WITNESSES IN SUPPORT.

I'M HERE TO PRESENT ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY FOUR FORTY EIGHT WHICH WILL ENSURE THAT YOU CAN FOSTER CARE AND YOUTH AND LOCAL JUVENILE OUT. DETENTION FACILITIES HAVE ACCESS TO THE INTERNET. OF TECHNOLOGY GO. DEVELOPMENT AND THE INTERNET ASK ACCESS EXCUSE ME ALLOW PEOPLE TO OBTAIN SOME INFORMATION THAT HELPS THEM GROW AND LEARN. IT HAS HELPED THEM TO STAY CONNECTED WITH THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS AND FRIENDS AND CONNECT THEM WITH SUPPORTIVE SERVICES THAT ENHANCE THEIR WELL BEING THE UNITED NATIONS. HAS. HAS GONE ARMS SO PART TO DECLARE THAT THE INTERNET ACCESS IS A HUMAN RIGHT. PEOPLE WHO CONNECT WHO CANNOT CONNECTED IT. ACCESS TO TECHNOLOGY OF THE INTERNET AVE SERIOUSLY DISADVANTAGE AS A RESULT OF THAT FOR EXAMPLE FOSTER YOUTH ARE MADE OUT OF HOME PLACEMENT AND JUVENILES AND LOCAL DETENTION FACILITIES MAY BE CUT OFF. FROM THE INTERNET ACCESS FOR YEARS AT A TIME ACCESS TO EDUCATIONAL RESOURCES AND COGNITIVE ATTY. PORTS SYSTEMS IS A BASIC RIGHT ONTO WHICH THEY ARE OFTEN DENIED. LAST YEAR THIS COMMITTEE PASSED ASSEMBLY BILL EIGHT ELEVEN WHICH WAS EXPERT WHICH EXPANDED. EXPANDED VERSION OF THIS BEALL HOWEVER. IT WAS VETOED BY THE GOVERNOR. WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT WE SHOULD. COME BACK AND ONLY FOCUS ON THE LOCAL. JUVENILE FACILITIES HERE WITH ME TO PROVIDE SUPPORTING TESTIMONIES OF FOR ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY FOUR FORTY EIGHT IS LUCY A CARTER WITH THE. YOUTH LAW CENTER. AND BLADE O. STRICT CHO STRAIGHT OSTER RIVER HERE I WAS A MEMBER OF THE CALIFORNIA YOUTH CONNECTION WHO WILL PROVIDE TESTIMONY. THANK YOU THANK YOU HAVE A MOTION UP BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER IS IN THE SECOND BY DOCTOR ARAMBULA. OKAY HELLO I'M I'M LUCY SALZEDO CARTER WITH THE YOUTH LAW CENTER AND THE YOUTH LAW CENTER ADVOCATES TO TRANSFORM THE JUVENILE JUSTICE AND CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM SO THAT ALL CHILDREN CAN THRIVE. WE'RE SPONSORING A AB TWENTY FOUR FORTY EIGHT. BECAUSE WE RECOGNIZE THAT YOUNG PEOPLE. IN THE SYSTEMS FACE SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES. AND WE WANT TO HELP ENSURE THAT THEY ARE SET UP FOR SUCCESS ACCESS TO COMPUTERS AND THE INTERNET AS PART OF ENSURING SUCCESS. WITHOUT THE FACT THAT IF THEY REMAIN ISOLATED SOCIALLY THEY CAN'T DEVELOP VALUABLE CAREER SKILLS. AND THEY MISS IMPORTANT EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES. COMPUTERS AND THE INTERNET ARE PART OF NORMAL LIFE IN TODAY'S SOCIETY. AND WE HAVE LAWS IN PLACE THAT SUPPORT YOUNG PEOPLE IN THE SYSTEMS HAVING NORMALCY GETTING TO HAVE AS NORMAL A LIFE AS THEY CAN POSSIBLY HAVE. I'M AND YET MANY OF THEM DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO COMPUTERS AND TECHNOLOGY. REMEDY THIS PROBLEM BY ADDING COMPUTER AND INTERNET. ACCESS TO THE CODE SECTION THAT SUPPORTS OTHER NORMAL AGE APPROPRIATE ACTIVITIES FOR SYSTEM INVOLVED YOUTH. AB TWENTY FOUR FORTY EIGHT HELPS MIXER THAT ACCESS TO COMPUTERS AND THE INTERNET. IS NOT DEPENDENT ON THE LUCK OF THE DRAW WHERE YOU JUST HAPPEN TO BE PLACED. BUT IS ACTUALLY. SOMETHING THAT IS CONSISTENT ACROSS PLACEMENTS. THE LAW DOES STILL LEAVE IT UP TO THE CARE GIVERS TO DECIDE WHAT CONSTITUTES APPROPRIATE ACCESS. AND WE KNOW THAT COMPUTER AND INTERNET ACCESS CAN MAKE A SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE DIFFERENCE IN THE LIVES OF SYSTEM INVOLVED YOUTH WE HAVE A STUDY IN WHICH I'M FOSTER YOUTH WERE GIVEN LAPTOPS AND AFTER A YEAR. THEY REPORTED IMPROVEMENTS IN THEIR GRADES BETTER FAMILY CONNECTIONS IMPROVE RELATIONSHIPS PIERCE AND FELT BETTER ABOUT THEIR OWN LIVES.

TO HAVE COMMUNICATION ON ANY PLATFORM WAS NOT A NORMALITY WHETHER. WHETHER IT IS COOLER FAMILY RELATIONSHIPS AFTER A COUPLE OF MONTHS OF BEING DETAINED MY BIGGEST FEAR WAS REINTEGRATION AND AND HELP THE REHABILITATION INTO SOCIETY. THIS IS THE FEAR BECAUSE THERE WAS LITTLE TO NO RESOURCES THAT HELPED THIS UNLESS IT WAS A PROBATION OFFICER. WHOSE MAIN FOCUS WAS NOT TO MAKE A PRODUCTIVE HUMAN. HUMAN BEING BUT TO CREATE THAT SEX IMBALANCES OF WHAT I NEED TO COMPLETE WHEN I GET OUT. WHEN ON THE OUTSIDE OF BEING IN THE TENTS AND IT WAS HARD FOR ME TO FIND A JOB. GET RIGHT BACK INTO SCHOOL BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF COMMUNICATION A HUGE HELP WOULD BE TO START COMMUNICATING AND SETTING UP A GAME PLAN WHEN INSIDE. BEFORE ACCESS. THE PERFECT PLATFORM FOR THIS GAME PLAN TO BE CREATED. WOULD BE TO HAVE INTERNET ACCESS THIS BILL WOULD NOT ONLY HELP WITH THEIR REINTEGRATION PROCESS BUT ALSO FOSTER CREATE IN PRACTICE HEALTHY RELATIONSHIPS WITH FAMILY MENTORS AND FRIENDS. BEING THAT IT IS TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN AND ALL SCHOOLS ARE IT'S SLOWLY INTEGRATING MOST ACTIVITIES AND LEARNING MATERIALS TO ELECTRONIC PLATFORMS INCLUDING INTERNET ACCESS SOME CORE DOES. IT WOULD BE A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION TO KEEP BY JUVENILE YOUTH AND FOSTERS UP TO PAR. WITH WITH THE LEARNING REVOLUTION THAT IS UPON US. WITH THE INTERNET ACCESS I WOULD HAVE BEEN WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN MORE ACTIVITIES AND CLASSES AND ALSO SET UP JOBS AND APPLY FOR MENTORS SIPS. WHILE INCARCERATED.

I'D LIKE TO START OFF BY ACCEPTING THE RECOMMENDED AMENDMENTS LOCATED IN THE COMMITTEES ANALYSIS BY THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFFFOR ALL THE WORK YOU'VE DONE. ON THIS BILL. AB TWO SEVEN FOUR FOUR PROVIDES CONSUMER PROTECTIONS AROUND THE ACTIVITIES OF REFERRAL AGENCIES FOR FAMILIES LOOKING TO PLACE THE DISABLED. AND SENIOR FAMILY MEMBERS INTO LONG TERM RESIDENTIAL CARE. ASSURING THAT CONSUMERS HAVE CLEAR TRANSPARENT INFORMATION ABOUT THE REFERRAL PROCESS AND THOSE MINIMUM STANDARDS ARE MET. FINDING QUALITY HOUSING AND CARE FOR A LOVED ONE IS DAUNTING EVEN UNDER THE MOST IDEAL CIRCUMSTANCES. FOR MOST THIS DECISION CAN FEEL RUSHED CREATING AN ENVIRONMENT THAT MAKES FAMILIES MORE VULNERABLE. TO THE PRESSURE AND MISINFORMATION THE MIGHT BE PROVIDED TO THEM. UNFORTUNATELY CONSUMERS OFTEN DO NOT HAVE THE TIME RESOURCES OR EXPORT EXPERTISE TO MAKE THE MOST INFORMED DECISIONS FOR THEMSELVES. OR THEIR LOVED ONES ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO ELDER CARE PLACEMENT AND HOUSING OPTIONS. IT IS AT THIS JUNCTURE THE REFERRAL AGENCY CAN BE OF GREAT HELP. OR GREAT HARM. TO CALIFORNIANS REFERRAL AGENCIES OFFER SENIORS AND FAMILIES. ASSISTANCE FINDING PLACEMENT IN A CARE FACILITY USUALLY A LICENSED RESIDENTIAL CARE FACILITY FOR THE ELDERLY. THESE ARE OFTEN FREE OF CHARGE TO THE PERSON BEING REFERRED. THESE REFERRAL AGENCIES ARE LARGELY UNREGULATED IN CALIFORNIA AND THE FINANCIAL INCENTIVES THEY RECEIVE ARE NOT ALWAYS THE CLEARLY DISCLOSE TO THE SENIOR. BEING PLACED OR THEIR FAMILIES. REFERRAL AGENCIES ALSO ARE NOT ALWAYS NECESSARILY FAMILIAR WITH THE FACILITIES TO WHICH THEY'RE REFERRING SENIORS. OR EVEN THE SPECIFIC NEEDS OF THE SENIORS THEY ARE REFERRING. THIS BILL ADDRESSES THESE THAT THESE ISSUES AND PROVIDES A NEED TO TRANSPARENCY AND PROTECTION NEEDED. HERE TO TESTIFY BEHALF OF THE BILL. ARE LINDA ARE MOST DIRECTOR OF THE NATIONAL REFERRAL EMPLACEMENT ALLIANCE. RONALD SIMPSON DIRECTOR AT ANTS AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA PRESIDENT OF SIX BEDS INK. AND WITH US ALSO IS ROXANA GOULD GOVERNMENT RELATIONS WHO WILL ALSO BE AVAILABLE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS. THANK YOU WELCOME. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIRMAN AND COMMITTEE. WHEN AN ELDERLY PERSON MAKES WHAT'S OFTEN THE LAST TO MOVE OF THEIR LIFE IT'S RARELY A JOYOUS OCCASION. A LOT OF A MOTIONS OF CONFUSION STRESSES INVOLVED PREVIOUSLY THIS PROFESSION HAS BEEN COMPLETELY UNREGULATED. AND AND NO CONSUMER PROTECTIONS. MANY PEOPLE ARE NOT EVEN AWARE OF THE VALUABLE SERVICE THAT SENIOR REFERRAL AGENCIES PROVIDE UNTIL THEY'RE IN THE MIDST OF A CRISIS AND AND. OFTEN ONLY HAVE FORTY EIGHT HOURS TOFIND A PLACE FOR A LOVED ONE WHO'S WHO'S BEING DISCHARGED FROM A HOSPITAL. UNABLE TO GO HOME. THEN THERE'S NO TIME TO SHOP AROUND. THE PUBLIC MAKES REASONABLE ASSUMPTIONS WHEN THEY ARE ME. READ PROMISES ABOUT EXPERT ADVISORS. THAT WILL HOLD THEIR HANDS THROUGH EVERY STEP OF THE PROCESS TO HELP THEM FIND PLACES TAILORED TO THEIR UNIQUE NEEDS. THEY DON'T THINK TO QUESTION WHETHER THAT SENIOR HOUSING ADVISER EXPERT. HAS EVER SEEN OR KNOWS ANYTHING ABOUT THE PLACES THEY ARE RECOMMENDING. IT SHOULDN'T MATTER WHETHER A FAMILIES SEARCHING ONLINE OR USING A LOCAL REFERRAL AGENCY THE SAME STANDARD SHOULD APPLY. TRAINING AND EXPERIENCE DO MATTER. THERE'S A CONDITION CALLED RELOCATION STRESS SYNDROME OR TRANSFER TRAUMA. THAT CAN CAUSE CRITICAL EMOTIONAL AND BEHAVIORAL SYMPTOMS ESPECIALLY IN FRAIL ARE CONFUSED ELDERLY. SEARCHING FOR APPROPRIATE HOUSING AND CARE IS VERY DIFFERENT THAN SHOPPING FOR A PAIR OF SHOES ARE AN OUTFIT. THAT CAN BE RETURNED IF IT'S NOT A GOOD FIT. A PLACE PERFECT FOR ONE PERSON MAY BE COMPLETELY WRONG OR EVEN DANGEROUS FOR ANOTHER. FAMILIES SHOULD HAVE A RIGHT TO HONEST DISCLOSURE THAT THE AGENCY WILL BE PAID A COMMISSION. AND THE RIGHT TO CANCEL IF NOT SATISFIED WITH THE SERVICES OF AN AGENCY. THERE ARE A MULTITUDE OF INNOCUOUS LOOKING WEBSITES POSING AS INFORMATIONAL SITES. THAT MEAN WE SERVE TO CAPTURE CONTACT INFORMATION TO BE SOLD. AND USED FOR REFERRALS TO ASSISTED LIVING COMMUNITIES FOR A COMMISSION OFTEN THE FAMILY HAS NO KNOWLEDGE THIS HAS HAPPENED UNTIL THEIR PHONE STARTS RINGING. THE COMPANY CAN ALSO CLAIM TO REPRESENT THE CLIENT INDEFINITELY WITHOUT THEIR PERMISSION. EVEN AFTER BEING TOLD TO CEASE CONTACT AND MAY STILL COLLECT COMMISSIONS YEARS LATER BECAUSE OF TERMS BURIED IN THE PRIVACY POLICY FINE PRINT. BECAUSE THEY NEVER ACTUALLY OPTED IN THERE IS NO WAY TO OPT OUT. FAMILIES DESERVE CHOICES AND TRANSPARENCY FOR THESE REASONS WE. WE REQUEST YOUR SUPPORT OF THE SMELL. THANK YOU. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS AND ROCK SINGLE REPRESENTING SIXPENCE INCUMBENT HERE TO TESTIFY I'M. HERE TO NOT INTRODUCE RON SIMPSON WHO IS ON THE BOARD AT SIX BEDS WHICH IS AN ASSOCIATION OF SMALL RESIDENTS RESIDENTIAL CARE FACILITIES FOR THE ELDERLY SIX BEDS OR FEWER. A SMALL FAMILY TYPESETTING AND SO OUT WITHOUT HIM DOCTOR ON A FEW. THANKS MIKE SENT. MADAM CHAIR COMMITTEE AB TWENTY SEVEN FORTY FOUR IS ABOUT. PROTECTING SENIORS AND THEIR FAMILIES IN THE COMPLICATED PROCESS OF FINDING AN APPROPRIATE CARE FACILITY. FAMILIES IN NEED IN THIS SITUATION ARE USUALLY IN CRISIS. IT IS ALSO A DIFFICULT EMOTIONAL TIME. OVER FIFTY PERCENT OF THOSE SEEKING HELP FEEL GUILTY ABOUT MAKING THIS PLACEMENT. CONSEQUENTLY THEY ARE E.. EVEN MORE VULNERABLE AND OFTEN UNAWARE THAT AS THEY GO INTO THE INTERNET SEEKING INFORMATION THEY'RE AGREEING TO ALLOW A REFERRAL AGENCY. NOT ONLY TO DISCLOSE BUT EVEN TO SELL THEIR PERSONAL INFORMATION. MUCH MORE TRANSPARENCY IS NEEDED IN THIS AREA AND THIS BILL WILL CODIFY THAT REQUIREMENT. JUST LAST WEEK I MET WITH THE GENTLEMAN LOOKING FOR REPLACEMENT FOR HIS MOTHER. HE TOLD ME JUST DAYS BEFORE HE WENT ON THE INTERNET SEEKING INFORMATION ANY OTHER HARDLY FINISHED. WHEN HIS PHONE STARTED RINGING NONSTOP. PEOPLE SEEKING HELP FOR REFERRAL AGENCIES EXPECT INDIVIDUALS REPRESENTING THEMSELVES AS EXPERTS TO UNDERSTAND BASIC CARE REQUIREMENTS FOR SUCH THINGS AS COGNITIVE LOSS DIABETES CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE. AND. CURRENTLY THERE IS NO TRAINING REQUIREMENT ANYONE. ANYONE CAN SAY THAT THEY ARE AN EXPERT REFERRAL AGENT. WE NEED TO CHANGE THAT AND ESTABLISH A MINIMAL TRAINING REQUIREMENTS SO FAMILIES ARE REASSURED THAT REFERRAL AGENTS CAN EVALUATE. AND MAKE APPROPRIATE PLACEMENTS. THERE IS GRAPHED IN COLLUSION IN THIS INDUSTRY THAT INFLUENCES THE WAY CLIENTS ARE REQUIRED AND REFERRALS ARE MADE. THIS RESULTS IN REFERRALS MADE FREQUENTLY FOR FINANCIAL GAIN NOT FOR THE BEST INTEREST OF THE NEEDY SENIORS. THE IS PERVASIVE INDUSTRY KICKBACKS CONTINUE EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE UNETHICAL IF NOT ILLEGAL. THIS CREATES UNFAIR BUSINESS PRACTICES AND EVEN WORSE AN INCENTIVE FOR PLACEMENTS AND FACILITIES THAT ARE NOT APPROPRIATE. THIS BILL OPENS TO PRACTICAL SIGNIFICANT MEANS OF ENFORCEMENT ONE. AND ACTION IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT INTO REMOVAL FROM THIS REGISTRY BY THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES MAKING IT ILLEGAL TO PROVIDE A REFERRAL. I URGE YOUR AYE VOTE ON. AB TWO TWENTY SEVEN FORTY FOURTH TO CREATE IMPORTANT PROTECTIONS FOR THE SENIOR ADULTS THANK YOU THANK YOU ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT.

THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR CLIFF BURKE HERE BEHALF OF PLACE FOR MOM OF THE COUNTRY'S LEADING. NATIONAL REFERRAL AGENCY ON THE INTERNET. WE WOULD LIKE TO BE IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL AND ARE WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR TO HOPEFULLY GET THERE. ARE WITH THE SPONSORS. YOU JUST BY WAY OF BRIEF HISTORY A PLACE FOR MOM SUPPORTED SIMILAR LEGISLATION OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS AUTHORED BY SENATOR MENDOZA VETO BY THE GOVERNOR. ON WE ARE STRONGLY IN SUPPORT OF BOTH TRANSPARENCY NOTICE AND. PROVIDING CONSUMERS WITH PROTECTION AYE WHEN WE FIRST SAW THIS BILL WE WERE CONCERNED THAT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF PROVISIONS THAT DIDN'T SEEM TO GO TO PROTECTING THE ELDERLY. OR CONSUMERS BUT SEEM TO GO TO TILTING THE PLAYING FIELD IN THE ECONOMIC RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN BUSINESS TO BUSINESS RELATIONSHIPS. I WANNA THANK THE AUTHOR THE COMMITTEE CHAIR AND HER STAFF FOR WORKING WITH ITS MOST OF THOSE PROVISIONS ALL CAME OUT. WELL WITH THE AMENDMENT SO ARM WE ACTUALLY HAVE ONE MAJOR ISSUE LEFT WITH THE BILL ARM WHICH I WILL MENTION HOPEFULLY WE CONTINUE TO WORK OUT. THAT'S LANGUAGE THAT IS IN THE BILL THAT IN ESSENCE WE THINK INSERTS THE CONSUMER IN THE FAMILY INTO OF. POTENTIAL FEE DISPUTE BETWEEN MULTIPLE REFERRAL AGENCIES SO THE STANDARD INDUSTRY PRACTICE IN THE STANDARD CONTRACT IN THIS BUSINESS. REMEMBER IN THIS SITUATION THE CONSUMERS ARE PAYING A FEE AT ALL IN ESSENCE THE REFERRAL FEES PAID BY THE FACILITY TO THE REFERRAL AGENCY. A STANDARD CONTRACT IN THE INDUSTRY IN THE BUSINESS MODEL ABSENCES THOSE CONTRACTS ALL SAY FIRST IN TIME WITH THE REFERRAL GETS PAID. WELL WHILE IT MAY BE SOMEWHAT ARBITRARY IN IN IN ANYONE'S MIND IT. ITSELF WHICH IS A SYSTEM THAT HAS WORKED WELL IN THE INDUSTRY OVERALL. ON THIS BILL CONTAINS A PROVISION THAT IN ESSENCE CONTRAVENES THOSE CONTRACTS IN SAYS THE FACILITY MAY GO TO THE CONSUMER. ASKS THE CONSUMER WHO THEY THINK THEY LIKE THE BEST AND THEN THE FACILITY CAN RELY UPON THAT TO PAY THAT REFERRAL AGENCY OVER. THE OTHER REFERRAL AGENCY IN MANY OF THE SITUATIONS THAT WE SEE ON A DAY TO DAY BASIS THE FAMILY ITSELF IS DIVIDED. AND THE FAMILY MAY HAVE MULTIPLE SIBLINGS WHO TRIED TO DO THE BEST FOR THEIR PARENTS HAVE CALLED DIFFERENT REFERRAL AGENCIES. INVOLVE MULTIPLE REFERRAL AGENCIES WE DON'T THINK IN THIS HIGHLY STRESSFUL SITUATION WHERE WE ARE INDEED IN A LIFE MILESTONES SITUATION. APPROPRIATE TO PUT THE CONSUMER FAMILY IN A PER SITUATION WHERE REFERRAL AGENCIES WILL BE PRESSURING THEM TO SAY PICK ME PICK ME TO GET THE FREE. ARM SO WE BELIEVE THAT ONE PROVISION REALLY IS NOT IN THE CONSUMER'S BEST INTERESTS OTHER THAN THAT. OF ANY OTHER SUGGESTIONS WE HAVE A FAIRLY CLARIFYING AND MINOR ON WE'RE HAPPY TO SUPPORT DISCLOSURE NOTICE FOR CONSUMERS TRAINING AND PER CAN SIMMER PROTECTION. WILL WE DO WANT TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON THAT PROVISION IN THERE FOR AT THIS POINT WE'RE NOT QUITE THERE. ARM IN A POSITION TO SUPPORT THE BILL ON HAVE TO OPPOSE IT TODAY. THANK YOU ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. OKAY SEEN NONE OF QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. OF THE UP TO CHOI. I THINK THIS IS ANOTHER. CRITICAL ISSUE. OH IN THE YOU REFERRAL. IF YOU REGISTER. AS HELLER COPIES TO PAYER. I'M A WAY FOR SERVICE PERSON. WHAT HOW WOULD YOU? IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF THEM REFERRING PERSON THE PERSON HAS TO HAVE SOME KNOWLEDGE OF ALL. THE FACILITY IS A PERSON IS GONNA. NOT RECOMMEND OR HAVE VISITED THE WAR. WHAT WOULD BE WHAT WOULD MAKE IT A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN? PRIOR. THE CONDITION AND THAT AFTER THIS SO ENACTED TO BAIL. I WILL TURN IT OVER TO ONE OF OUR. ONE OF OUR SPEAKERS. HOWEVER. AS WITH ANYTHING I THINK THAT IF YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE A REFERRAL TO A PARTICULAR. PLACE. THE IT SHOULD BE FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE PERSON YOU'RE REFERRING AS OPPOSED TO FINANCIAL GAIN FOR THE ONE MAKING THE REFERRAL. THE I THAT I SIGNED A STANDOUT PART THOUGH IT IN WITHOUT PUTTING REFERRING PER SON. EVEN THE TO EQUAL ONE. OF THEY MADE OUT RECOMMEND AGENCY AYE EIGHTY IF AGENTS A PAGE BEAM MORE. BUT. THIS A REQUIREMENT A TO REGISTER WITH A SOCIAL SERVICES. HOW WOULD YOU DO IT IMPROVE MY SERVICE QUALITY? JUST ARE. JUST A PAPER WORKER TO FIVE HAVE. HOW WOULD THE DEPARTMENT THE ASSURE THAT THE AFTER I HAVE BEEN REGISTERED THE MY CBS? QUALITY WOULD BE BETTER THAN. IN ALL. NO SUCH REGULATION. A GOOD QUESTION I'M GOING TO ASK MS COOLED IF SHE WILL SURE ABSOLUTELY THAT ARGUES MONTHS NOTHING GOLD REPRESENTING SIX BEDS. I'M OUR OBJECTIVE WITH THE BILL IS TO. TO PROVIDE TRANSPARENCY CLARITY WHAT WE GET WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT IS THAT I HAD A PERSONAL EXPERIENCE WERE OF LOOKING FOR A PLACE FOR MY MOM. AYE BECAUSE OF THE BENEFIT OF REPRESENTING SIX BEDS I KNEW THE NAME OF THE FACILITY THAT I WANTED TO GO TO. I WENT ONLINE AND I WENT THROUGH SIX GOOGLE PAGE SEARCHES WHERE WAS ONE. ONE LISTING AFTER ANOTHER WITH A PICTURE OF A HOME REPRESENTING AS IF IT WAS THE HOME I WAS LOOKING FOR I CALLED AND IT WAS INSTEAD REFERRAL AGENCY. AND SO OUR CONCERN IS FIRST OF ALL AND THERE IS NOT AN INCENTIVE FOR THOSE AGENCIES TO BE FAMILIAR WITH THE CONDITION OF THE PERSON THEY'RE PLACING. THOUGH IT HAD NOT BEEN A REQUIREMENT FOR THEM HAVE ANY FAMILIARITY WITH THE FACILITY TO PLACING THEM IN THE BACK AND ONE OF THE COMMITTEES. A REFERRAL AGENCY THATWAS NOT A PLACE FOR MOM SAID I CAN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THE FACILITIES THAT WORK IN NEW JERSEY. WE THINK THAT DOESN'T MATTER WE THINK YOU SHOULD HAVE TO KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT MY MOM SOMETHING ABOUT THE PLACE YOU'RE PLACING HER SO THAT IT'S AN APPROPRIATE RELATIONSHIP AND THEN IN ADDITION TO THAT THE FEE IS TRUE. YOU KNOW IT IT THEY ARE THEY ARE ON. THEY ADVERTISE THAT IT'S FREE. IT'S TRUE IT'S FREE TO THE PERSON THEY'RE PLACING BUT IT THERE FOR A SIX BED FACILITY IF IT'S A MONTH OR MONTH AND A HALF. RENT WE HAVE TO PAY THE REFERRAL AGENCY WE THINK THAT THE PERSON BEING PLACED SHOULD KNOW THAT THERE'S AN INCENTIVE FOR THAT EIGHT THAT AGENCY TO REFER THEM TO PARTICULAR HOME BECAUSE OF THAT FEET. AND SO THEY'RE STRAINING IN THE BELL. WHICH WILL HELP TO MAKE SURE THEY KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT THE CONDITION AND I BELIEVE THIS REQUIREMENT FOR THEM TO HAVE A FAMILIARITY WITH THE FACILITY THEIR PLACE IN THE RESIDENT WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT DOESN'T EXIST TODAY. ARE YOU SAYING THAT THE SO SCREENING PROCEDURE IN THIS BILL THAT THE HARLEM MY SERVICE TO MY KNOWLEDGE OF TI FACILITIES ARE I'M ABOUT TO RECOMMEND TO MY CLIENTS A TRAINING REQUIREMENT YES. WHO'S GONNA DO TRAINING. BUT I THINK IT WAS TRAINER CRIME EITHER THROUGH DSS OR OUTSIDE SOURCES WITH DSS WOULD BE THE REGULATORY AUTHORITY TO ENSURE THE TRAINING IS ADEQUATE INAPPROPRIATE. IT'S A REGISTRATION PROCESS WHICH IS. ONE REASON WE BELIEVE THE GOVERNOR VETOED A PREVIOUS BILL BECAUSE IT WAS A LICENSING DEL WHICH ADDED EXTENSIVE COST SO THAT'S WHY IT'S A REGISTRATION PROCESS TO TRY TO ALLEVIATE THAT FINANCIALLY OR INTENT IS GOOD BUT DOWN TO MAKE SURE THAT THOUGHT THIS PSALM. IT EDITION HONOR REGULATION. TO REGISTER NOW FOR. THE REFERRING PERSON. WHO WAS DOING THAT THIRTY FOREST SERVICE OUT WATER? BUT NOT ONLY JUST GOING THROUGH A COMMISSIONER OF OUR REGULATIONS AND THEY ARE IN REGISTRATION COSTA WHATEVER. ACTUALLY. YOU KNOW MY NOT KNOWLEDGE IN THE MORNING. ARE ETHICS OF WOULD BE IMPACTS TO BUY THIS BILL SO WHY NOT JUST OF. PAPERWORK ON KNOWLEDGE OF BUT THE ACTUAL FOR EXAMPLE KILL GRAFICA. A I COME FROM ORANGE COUNTY IF I TO REFORM SERVICE A IN ORANGE COUNTY. THAN THE SOME SOME LIMITATIONS SO THAT THOUGHT I WOULD HAVE ABILITY TO VISIT THE OF THE FACILITIES ARE IN MY AREA I HAVE A SOME INTIMATE KNOWLEDGE OF THE SAID FACILITIES AND STAFF MEMBERS. AND THEN ALSO CLIENT CONDITION AND IF TO SELL OR TIMER OF. A SUFFERING PATIENT THE THEN THE SUDDEN FACILITY WOULD HAVE A BETTER. KIDDO A GIVING NAM ABILITY THAN YOU CAN WE FOR. MAYBE TWO THIRTY YEAH AND THEN THE FAMILIES THAT WOULD DECIDE ON THE AND ULTIMATELY KNOW BY COMPARISON. NOT JUST OF. MY YOU KNOW. YEAH ARMCHAIR PAPERWORK ON AND THEN YOU CORD VIA FIND OUT THE. SO WHAT I HOPE FOR THIS BILL WOULD ACTUALLY. DEMAND THE. CORD FOR WITH OUT REFORM SERVICES SAW A WILL ENHANCE THE ONCOLOGY AND THEN ETHICS. WE WOULD WHOLEHEARTEDLY AGREE WITH WHAT YOU'RE SAYING WHAT YOUR OBJECTIVE IS IS EXACTLY THE OBJECTIVE OF THE BILL SUCH. YOU KNOW WE AND KNOW WHERE TRYING TO PASS SOMETHING THAT REALLY JUST GOING TO BE PUSHING ALL OF THE PAPER AROUND AND NOT DO ANYTHING AT THE END OF THE DAY SUCKING EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH. THANK YOU ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. OKAY I HAVE OWNED UP WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE AND I HAVE A RECOMMENDATION AS TO PATH AS AMENDED TO THE ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE ON AGING AND LONG TERM CARE.

CHILD'S BEHAVIOR AB TWENTY SIX NINETY EIGHT ENABLES CHILDREN IN THE CALIFORNIA'S THE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM TO BENEFIT FROM EARLY CHILDHOOD MENTAL HEALTH CONSULTATION. THIS BILL IS ABOUT GETTING RESOURCES INTO THE CLASSROOM TO HELP ADDRESS CHALLENGING BEHAVIORS AND PREVENTING FUTURE EXPULSIONS WERE SIMPLY AUTHORIZING PROVIDERS TO UTILIZE EXISTING SUBSIDIZED CHILDCARE FUNDING TO PROVIDE THESE VALUABLE SERVICES WHICH RESEARCH SHOWS. WILL IMPROVE OUTCOMES FOR CHILDREN NATIONALLY THREE OUT OF FOUR. I'M SORRY NATIONALLY THREE AND FOUR YEAR OLDS AND ROLL THEM PRE K. ARE EXPELLED.

EXPULSION RATES ARE EVEN HIGHER THAN THE NATIONAL AVERAGE FROM THIS DATA WE CONCLUDE THAT PRE K. EXPULSION. DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTS CHILDREN OF COLOR THESE THIS BILL WILL MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR PROVIDERS TO PURSUE EFFECTIVE EARLY CHILDHOOD MENTAL HEALTH CONSULTATION MODELS WHICH WE KNOW IN ADDITION TO OTHER BENEFICIAL OUTCOMES. CAN HELP WITH REDUCING EXPLOSIONS WITH EXISTING CONTRACT FUNDS I HAVE. HERE WITH ME ADDRESS GARCIA WITH TO DANGLE THE SPONSORS OF THE BILL TO TALK MORE ABOUT EARLY CHILDHOOD MENTAL HEALTH CONSULTATION. THANK YOU FIRST WITH THIS PLACE. SHARON MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME AS A PLACE HERE HI MY NAME'S ON THAT I SEE AND I'M THE SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND ORGANIZATIONAL LEADERSHIP ACCUTANE GO. HIGH OVERSEE BOTH BEHAVIOR HEALTH DEPARTMENT AND EARLY INTERVENTION SERVICES. GETTING GO IS A NONPROFIT EARLY EDUCATION PROVIDER THAT SERVES NEARLY FOUR THOUSAND CHILDREN. AND ABOUT NINETY FIVE PERCENT OF THE FAMILIES THAT WE SERVE RECEIVE FREE OR LOW COST CARE. SO MEDICAL CONSULTATION IS IMPORTANT AND WE NEED TO INCREASE THE ACCESS FOR THE ULTIMATE BENEFIT OF ALL CHILDREN. SO THIS MODEL PROVIDES CRUCIAL SUPPORT FOR EFFECTIVE CLASSROOM MANAGEMENT AND POSITIVE LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS INCLUDING STRATEGIES TO SUPPORT CHILDREN WITH CHALLENGING BEHAVIORS AND OTHER SOCIAL EMOTIONAL AND MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS. SO THIS TRULY IS A COLLABORATIVE EFFORT TO THE COLLABORATIVE APPROACH BETWEEN THE MENTAL HEALTH CONSULTANTS THE TEACHERS THE PARENTS AND OTHER EARLY EDUCATION PROVIDING STAFF. TO REALLY PARTNER TOGETHER AND IMPROVE THE OUTCOMES OF ALL CHILDREN ESPECIALLY THOSE THAT ARE HAVING THE AIR EXHIBITING THE CHALLENGING BEHAVIORS. SO I WANT TO SHARE JUST ONE STORY WITH YOU TAKE THIS IS A TRANSFORMATIVE OUTCOME OF CONSULTATION QUE. JACKSON CAME INTO THE CLASSROOM WITH THE HISTORY THAT REALLY NO FOUR YEAR OLD SHOULD NEVER HAVE. WHICH CONTRIBUTED TO A A VULNERABLE LEARNING FOUNDATION FOR HIM. IN MOMENTS OF DISTRESS YOU WOULD SEE HIM KICK SCREAM BITE AND HIT. ALL OF THESE HAD REALLY BECOME THE NORM AND NOW HE WAS FUNCTIONING IN THIS CLASSROOM. SO. YOU KNOW THERE WAS A CLIMATE OF STRESS THAT HAD REALLY STARTED TO TO. OVERSHADOW THE CLASSROOM AND THE TEACHERS ALTHOUGH VERY EXPERIENCED THEY WERE PHILLY PUSHED TO THE EDGE AND THEIR ABILITY TO REALLY PROVIDE SUPPORT. AND THEY WANTED TO TRULY TAP INTO HIS POTENTIAL ALTHOUGH CLOUDED HE WAS STILL VERY CREATIVE HE WAS REALLY PLAYFUL AND THEY WANTED TO SUPPORT THAT. SO THE CONSULTANTS AND COLLABORATION WITH THE PARENTS AND THE TEACHERS WERE ABLE TO JOIN TOGETHER AND IDENTIFIED THAT WOULD JACKSON'S. SPECIFIC NEEDS AND THEY DEVELOPED A JOINT MENTAL HEALTH ENHANCED. BE ABLE PLAN FOR HIM SUPPORT PLAN. SO THROUGHOUT SOMETIME WITH COLOR COLLABORATION CAN YOU TENT CONTINUING AND THE PERSISTENCE OF THE TEACHER THE CONSULTANTS AND THE PARENTS. IT THAT'S THE POINT WHERE JACKSON WAS MUCH MORE CALM IN THE CLASSROOM WAS ABLE TO ACTIVELY ENGAGE IN LEARNING AND HIS OVERALL HOME. INTERACTIONS WITH BOTH HIS PEERS AND HIS TEACHERS WERE MUCH MORE POSITIVE. SO THIS REALLY ALLOWED THE ENTIRE CLASS TO REFOCUS THEIR THEIR ENERGY INTO THE JOY OF REALLY LEARNING. SO PARTS OF CONSULTATION JACKSON REALLY WAS ON THE PATH TOWARDS X.. EXPULSION. MENTAL HEALTH CONSULTATION REALLY TRANSFORMED THAT FORK FOR JACKSON. AND THIS IS JUST ONE STORY BUT THERE ARE MANY MANY OTHER JACKSON'S OUT THERE. THAT COULD REALLY BENEFIT FROM A BILL LIKE THIS SO I JUST THINK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND I APPRECIATE YOU CONSIDERING AB TWENTY SIX NINETY EIGHT. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. THING THAT ANYONE IS IN OPPOSITION. SINGER BACK TO THE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS COMMENTS THREATS. I JUST LOVE YOUR STORY OF JACKSON. BECAUSE THE TRUTH IS EVERY CHILD SHOULD HAVE THAT. PUTTING A CHILD ON THE PATH TO EXPULSION AND WE KNOW THAT THEN IF THAT'S THE BEGINNING OF. OF THE THE HILL THAT'S THE BEGINNING OF EVERYTHING GO WRONG. SO I APPRECIATE FIRST OF ALL OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER YOU'RE BRINGING THAT THIS BILL FORWARD. BUT HONESTLY WE DO NEED TO PROVIDE THAT SERVICE TO OUR TO OUR CHILDREN AT ALL AGES. THANK YOU. YOU. HEATHER COVER. SING NONE. GOV ESTIMATE. THANK YOU HAS TWENTY THANK THE AUTHOR FOR THE BILL I SPENT.
