00:35:15.746 --> 00:35:18.983
THAT NUMBER- FROM THE WHAT'S

00:35:19.050 --> 00:35:20.785
BEING WHAT WAS ALLOWED IN THE

00:35:20.852 --> 00:35:22.253
HAVE AREEMENT TO AN AVERAGE

00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:23.721
BETWEEN WHAT WAS STATED IN THE

00:35:23.788 --> 00:35:25.523
AGREEMENT AND WHAT THE

00:35:25.590 --> 00:35:26.524
INTERVENOR ONCE WE THINK

00:35:26.591 --> 00:35:29.894
THAT'S- PREJUDICES- THE

00:35:29.961 --> 00:35:31.662
ARBITRATOR. AND PUTS IN THEIR

00:35:31.729 --> 00:35:33.498
MIND THAT SOMETHING LESS IS

00:35:33.564 --> 00:35:34.932
WARRANTED ONE THAT MAY NOT BE

00:35:34.999 --> 00:35:36.734
THE CASE AT ALL ACTUALLY IN

00:35:36.801 --> 00:35:40.171
THIS CASE THE- AMOUNT THAT WAS-

00:35:40.238 --> 00:35:41.239
BEEN AT THE RETURN HAVE

00:35:41.305 --> 00:35:43.040
AGREEMENT RATE WAS WHICH IS

00:35:43.107 --> 00:35:44.942
TRADITIONALLY BEEN CHARGED- IN

00:35:45.009 --> 00:35:46.577
ADDITION THIS BILL TRIES TO SET

00:35:46.644 --> 00:35:48.079
FORTH A STANDARD FOR THE

00:35:48.145 --> 00:35:49.814
ARBITRATOR LOOK AT. AND IN

00:35:49.881 --> 00:35:51.082
FAIRNESS THAT WAS AN ISSUE

00:35:51.148 --> 00:35:56.554
RAISED IN OUR LAWSUIT. HOWEVER-

00:35:56.621 --> 00:35:57.488
THE STANDARD THIS PUT IN THEIR

00:35:57.555 --> 00:35:59.957
BASE LOOKS AT CAL. FAN AND THE

00:36:00.024 --> 00:36:01.959
RATE- EIGHTY W. PROVIDERS ARE

00:36:02.026 --> 00:36:04.929
BEING PAID IN CALIFORNIA-

00:36:04.996 --> 00:36:06.330
TRADITIONALLY CHURCHILL DOWNS

00:36:06.397 --> 00:36:08.099
HAS BEEN ABLE TO NEGOTIATE. A

00:36:08.165 --> 00:36:10.034
HIGHER RATE BASICALLY BECAUSE

00:36:10.101 --> 00:36:12.403
THEY HAVE A BETTER PRODUCT- SO

00:36:12.470 --> 00:36:14.238
THE WAY THIS STANDARD WORKS.

00:36:14.305 --> 00:36:16.541
ESSENTIALLY IS THAT NOW IN

00:36:16.607 --> 00:36:18.643
ARBITRATION BILL THEIR PRODUCT

00:36:18.709 --> 00:36:20.912
IS VIEWED THE SAME AS A SUB

00:36:20.978 --> 00:36:22.547
STANDARD PRODUCT THE STRUGGLE A

00:36:22.613 --> 00:36:26.751
LOWER RATE- LASTLY. I THINK THE

00:36:26.817 --> 00:36:29.153
IDEA OF THE STATUTE ALL ALONG

00:36:29.220 --> 00:36:30.321
WAS TO PROVIDE THAT IF THERE

00:36:30.388 --> 00:36:31.923
WAS AN ISSUE WITH ARBITRATION

00:36:31.989 --> 00:36:35.760
AGREEMENT. THAT INTERFERE COULD

00:36:35.826 --> 00:36:36.928
COME IN AND- NO BECAUSE A

00:36:36.994 --> 00:36:38.663
PROCESS TO GO THROUGH COUNTERED

00:36:38.729 --> 00:36:40.264
AGREEMENT THERE. THE WAY THE

00:36:40.331 --> 00:36:41.799
STATURE ACTUALLY WORKS OUT I

00:36:41.866 --> 00:36:43.034
THINK THIS IS THE FIRST TIME

00:36:43.100 --> 00:36:44.468
IT'S EVER BEEN USED IN FIFTEEN

00:36:44.535 --> 00:36:49.307
YEARS- ON THE BOOKS IS THAT-

00:36:49.373 --> 00:36:51.943
YOU CAN HAVE A SITUATION WHERE-

00:36:52.009 --> 00:36:53.244
AS AN ART OF WITH THE RATE

00:36:53.311 --> 00:36:54.378
BEING PAID WAS THE SAME IT'S

00:36:54.445 --> 00:36:55.813
ALWAYS BEEN PAID. THERE'S NO

00:36:55.880 --> 00:36:58.282
REALLY ISSUE AT ALL BUT YOU CAN

00:36:58.349 --> 00:36:59.150
HAVE AN INTERVENOR THAT FOR

00:36:59.216 --> 00:37:01.152
INSTANCE- YOU KNOW DOESN'T LIKE

00:37:01.218 --> 00:37:02.453
SOMETHING ELSE YOU'RE DOING IN

00:37:02.520 --> 00:37:04.455
THE MARKET PLACE. AND SO TO

00:37:04.522 --> 00:37:06.290
MESS WITH YOU THEY WANTED THEY

00:37:06.357 --> 00:37:07.224
BASICALLY BECAUSE AN

00:37:07.291 --> 00:37:08.292
INTERVENTION IN THIS AND

00:37:08.359 --> 00:37:09.460
THREATEN AN INTERVENTION THAT'S

00:37:09.527 --> 00:37:10.461
IN FACT WHAT KIND OF WHAT

00:37:10.528 --> 00:37:12.263
HAPPENED. IN THIS SITUATION I

00:37:12.330 --> 00:37:14.098
DON'T THINK THAT'S WHAT THE

00:37:14.165 --> 00:37:18.269
STATUTE WAS INTENDED TO DO. YOU

00:37:18.336 --> 00:37:20.504
KNOW- IN THE- IN THE END- I

00:37:20.571 --> 00:37:21.439
THINK ONE OF THE WITNESSES

00:37:21.505 --> 00:37:23.107
EXPERT WITNESSES IN THE SENATE

00:37:23.174 --> 00:37:25.476

FIFTEEN YEARS AND PRINT FAIR AT

00:37:28.179 --> 00:37:30.381
ALL. WELL THAT'S THE CASE THEN

00:37:30.448 --> 00:37:32.550
OTHER THAN CHANGING THE- APPEAL

00:37:32.617 --> 00:37:34.318
