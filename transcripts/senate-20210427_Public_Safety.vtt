00:16:40.366 --> 00:16:43.302
PROBLEM HERE AND THAT THE ISSUE

00:16:43.369 --> 00:16:45.571
WE MUST REMAIN OPPOSED I AM

00:16:45.637 --> 00:16:48.073
ALSO A TRAUMA SURVIVOR HOWEVER

00:16:48.140 --> 00:16:50.542
I SHARE ALL OF THESE CONCERNS

00:16:50.609 --> 00:16:51.944
OF THE PUBLIC DEFENDERS

00:16:52.010 --> 00:16:54.680
ASSOCIATION. SB FIFTY THREE

00:16:54.747 --> 00:16:57.383

00:16:57.449 --> 00:16:58.817
I'LL BE AT THE NUMBER ACTION

00:16:58.884 --> 00:17:01.019
EPA HAS PROPOSED THE CRIMINAL

00:17:03.922 --> 00:17:08.127
AMEND THE CIVIL CODE. TO ADD

00:17:08.193 --> 00:17:08.727
THIS BEHAVIOR AS THE TORT. A

00:17:08.794 --> 00:17:11.130
TORT REQUIRES THAT HARM B.

00:17:11.196 --> 00:17:13.799
CREW. ANY INFRACTION DOES NOT

00:17:13.866 --> 00:17:15.801
REQUIRE THIS PROVES. A COURT

00:17:15.868 --> 00:17:18.003
WOULD ALLOW THE CIVIL COURTS TO

00:17:18.070 --> 00:17:19.138
HANDLE THE ISSUE RATHER THAN

00:17:19.204 --> 00:17:20.706

MATTER COULD INVOLVE LAWYERS

00:17:25.110 --> 00:17:26.612
HOWEVER ATTORNEYS FEES ARE

00:17:26.678 --> 00:17:28.547
RECOVERABLE AN INFRACTION

00:17:28.614 --> 00:17:30.482
ALLOWS YOU KNOW ATTORNEYS AND

00:17:30.549 --> 00:17:32.017
MOST OF THIS CENTURY WOULD NOT

00:17:32.084 --> 00:17:33.552
EVEN KNOW THEY HAVE A RIGHT TO

00:17:33.619 --> 00:17:36.255
A BENCH TRIAL. I STATE THIS

00:17:36.321 --> 00:17:38.657

YEARS AND- CRIMINAL DEFENSE.

00:17:41.894 --> 00:17:42.928
THE COURT WOULD ALLOW THE MONEY

00:17:42.995 --> 00:17:45.063
JUDGMENT TO GO TO THE VICTIM

00:17:45.130 --> 00:17:48.333
AND INFRACTION FINE COULD GO

00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:50.202
BACK INTO THE SYSTEM COFFERS.

00:17:50.269 --> 00:17:52.371

00:17:52.438 --> 00:17:54.573

00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:56.408
SCIENTIFICALLY KNOWN TO BE MORE

00:17:56.475 --> 00:17:58.444

00:17:58.510 --> 00:18:01.146
PEER PRESSURE. YOU TO ENGAGE IN

00:18:01.213 --> 00:18:03.248
THIS PRESCRIBED BEHAVIOR SHOULD

00:18:03.315 --> 00:18:04.983
BE EDUCATED NOT CRIMINALLY

00:18:05.050 --> 00:18:08.153
PUNISHED. LASTLY AN INFRACTION

00:18:08.220 --> 00:18:09.988

00:18:10.055 --> 00:18:12.391

CONCERN ABOUT WHETHER THIS

THE TEXT OF THE BILL FROM. I. I

00:22:58.410 --> 00:23:00.212

ADULT TO MAYBE THE PERPETRATOR

00:23:17.796 --> 00:23:20.766

ACT HOWEVER IF THE WORD GETS

00:23:43.522 --> 00:23:50.428
OUT. THAT SUCH AN ACTION COULD-

00:23:50.495 --> 00:23:51.997
FIVE HAVE THIS CRIMINAL HAS PUT

00:23:52.063 --> 00:23:54.699

00:23:54.766 --> 00:23:56.701
AFFECT SOME OF THESE ADULTS NOW

THE CONSEQUENCE OF RECORDS IS

00:25:02.534 --> 00:25:04.102
REALLY REALLY SERIOUS ON A

00:25:04.169 --> 00:25:07.172
JUVENILE AND I DON'T KNOW.

00:25:07.239 --> 00:25:10.041

AND I DON'T KNOW IF IT WAS

00:25:10.642 --> 00:25:13.645
EXPLORED. WHETHER THERE COULD

00:25:13.712 --> 00:25:18.717

01:34:31.565 --> 01:34:34.268
FACT THAT THIS BILL WOULD BE IN

01:34:34.335 --> 01:34:36.203

AWAY- IF YOU TALK ABOUT THE

01:34:52.453 --> 01:34:53.988
SAME THING REMOVE FROM THE

JUDGES THE ABILITY TO USE THEIR

DISCRETION. AND I. I BELIEVE

01:34:59.293 --> 01:35:01.429
SOME MANY OF US BELIEVE THAT

01:35:01.495 --> 01:35:04.165
THIS IS A TIME WHEN IT WAS JUST

01:35:04.231 --> 01:35:06.700

01:35:06.767 --> 01:35:09.236

WORKING THAT'S OR FINING IS NOT

01:35:19.146 --> 01:35:20.915

01:35:20.981 --> 01:35:24.118
THIS CHANGE BECAUSE- IT'S NOT.

01:35:24.185 --> 01:35:26.320
WORKING ANYMORE TO GIVE THE

01:35:47.541 --> 01:35:49.243
OPPORTUNITY FOR THE JUDGE TO

01:35:49.310 --> 01:35:50.711
CONSIDER THOSE. IF IT'S PUT

01:35:50.778 --> 01:35:53.347

SAYS- IT IGNORES. THIS BILL

01:36:06.961 --> 01:36:08.195
WOULD IGNORE THE COURTS

01:36:08.262 --> 01:36:10.131
EXISTING DISCRETION IN CASES

01:36:10.197 --> 01:36:11.565
WHERE THE DEFENDANT IS ACTUALLY

01:36:11.632 --> 01:36:14.935
A MINOR. PENAL CODE ONE NINETY

01:36:15.002 --> 01:36:16.937

01:36:20.341 --> 01:36:21.809
TWENTY FIVE TO LIFE IN CASES

DO WITH PEOPLE UNDER THE AGE OF

TWENTY FIVE TO LIFE OR LIFE

01:36:59.113 --> 01:37:00.080

REHABILITATION. FOR THIS BILL

01:37:30.311 --> 01:37:31.645
DOES NOT REMOVE THE SENTENCE OF

LIFE WITHOUT PAROLE IT SIMPLY

01:37:33.380 --> 01:37:34.782
GIVES THE JUDGE'S DISCRETION

01:37:34.848 --> 01:37:36.684

REALLY DOES MAKE GOOD SENSE

01:48:52.826 --> 01:48:54.561
FIRST IT ONLY APPLIES TO A VERY

01:48:54.628 --> 01:48:56.029
SMALL PERCENT OF THE INMATE

01:48:56.096 --> 01:48:57.697

01:49:06.706 --> 01:49:08.708
SEX OFFENDERS BY INFLICTING

01:49:08.775 --> 01:49:10.744
VIOLENCE SEXUAL OFFENSES MAINLY

01:49:10.810 --> 01:49:12.913
AGAINST WOMEN AND IN SOME CASES

01:49:12.979 --> 01:49:15.315
TORTURE. WHEN THE LEGISLATURE

ENACTED THE SEX ONE STRIKE LAW

01:49:18.018 --> 01:49:20.020
THE LEGISLATIVE HISTORY I

01:49:20.086 --> 01:49:21.354
RESEARCHED AND LOOKED AT IT

01:49:21.421 --> 01:49:23.223
SAID THEY WERE CONCERNED ABOUT

01:49:23.290 --> 01:49:25.125
HIGHER REPEAT OFFENDING AWAIT

01:49:25.191 --> 01:49:26.726
RECIDIVISM AND THEN THEY WANT

01:49:26.793 --> 01:49:27.827
TO TAKE THAT CHANCE SO THAT WAS

01:49:27.894 --> 01:49:30.664
THE IMPETUS BEHIND THE LAW. AND

01:49:30.730 --> 01:49:32.666
THEY HAVE TO COMMIT EXTREMELY

01:49:32.732 --> 01:49:34.401

CHILD MOLESTER UNDER FOURTEEN

01:49:38.305 --> 01:49:40.307
TYING AND BINDING THE VICTIM

01:49:40.373 --> 01:49:41.675
ATTACKING THEM IN THEIR HOME

01:49:52.285 --> 01:49:53.653
ARE JUST TOO HORRENDOUS IN

01:49:53.720 --> 01:49:55.755
NATURE AND TORTURE RAPISTS AND

01:49:55.822 --> 01:49:58.358
MURDERERS FALL INTO THAT CLASS

01:49:58.425 --> 01:50:00.493
AND CERTAINLY THEY CAN SEEK

01:50:00.560 --> 01:50:02.062
CLEMENCY COMMUTATION OF

01:50:02.128 --> 01:50:03.830

TRAUMATIZE THESE FEMALE VICTIMS

01:50:08.835 --> 01:50:11.004

IS THAT THIS BILL MAKES THE

01:56:00.119 --> 01:56:02.155
FALSE ASSUMPTION THAT-

YOU SEE THAT THE PRIOR YEAR WAS

01:56:22.041 --> 01:56:23.676
SIMILAR. I DON'T THINK ANY OF

01:56:23.743 --> 01:56:25.845
US REALLY EXPECTS THAT OUR LAW

DON'T SEE IT HAPPENING. MY LAST

01:56:33.019 --> 01:56:35.822

01:58:41.681 --> 01:58:43.483
THE OTHER PROGRAM DID ARRIVE IF

INCLUDES PEOPLE CONVICTED UNDER

01:58:57.363 --> 01:58:58.564
THE THREE STRIKES LAW.

AGUIAR-CURRY DEATH AND VOTE

01:59:01.267 --> 01:59:02.702
INDICATIVE OF FIRST DEGREE

01:59:02.768 --> 01:59:04.270
MURDER KILLING A POLICE OFFICER

02:05:03.896 --> 02:05:04.363
ON THE QUESTION HERE IS

02:05:04.430 --> 02:05:06.599
WHETHER. THESE PARTICULAR

02:05:06.665 --> 02:05:08.200
CRIMES SHOULD BE TREATED

02:05:08.267 --> 02:05:09.268
DIFFERENTLY FROM THOSE OTHER

02:05:09.335 --> 02:05:10.769
VERY SERIOUS CRIMES BY BEING

02:05:10.836 --> 02:05:12.504
CATEGORICALLY EXCLUDED FROM THE

02:05:12.571 --> 02:05:19.278
ELDERLY- PAROLE- PROGRAM- AND

02:05:19.345 --> 02:05:21.513
IT- I DON'T. I'D I DON'T THINK

02:05:21.580 --> 02:05:23.315
WE SHOULD BE MAKING. THAT

02:05:23.382 --> 02:05:24.884
DISTINCTION PUTTING ASIDE THE

02:05:24.950 --> 02:05:26.385
CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUE BECAUSE WE

02:05:26.452 --> 02:05:27.753
KNOW WE ARE YOU KNOW WHAT

02:05:27.820 --> 02:05:29.822
HAPPENED WITH THE EXCLUSION OF

02:05:29.889 --> 02:05:33.058
THESE PARTICULAR- CRIMES FROM

02:05:33.125 --> 02:05:36.562
THE YOUTH- PAPA PROGRAM- SO

02:05:36.629 --> 02:05:39.899
THAT IS OBVIOUSLY VERY SERIOUS

02:05:39.965 --> 02:05:41.300
ISSUE IN TERMS OF THIS.

02:05:41.367 --> 02:05:42.801
UNLIKELY BEING DEEMED

02:05:42.868 --> 02:05:45.604
UNCONSTITUTIONAL- BUT IT'S ON A

02:05:45.671 --> 02:05:49.508
ON A POLICY LEVEL- IN THE HOLD

02:05:49.575 --> 02:05:51.610
THE POINT OF THIS PROGRAM IS-

02:05:51.677 --> 02:05:53.746
IF YOU SERVED. AT LEAST TWENTY

02:05:53.812 --> 02:05:59.485
YEARS- AND IF YOU ARE- DEEMS-

02:05:59.551 --> 02:06:03.122
TO- TO NOT PRESENT- A RISK THEN

02:06:03.188 --> 02:06:05.624
YOU CAN BE CONSIDERED FOR- FOR

02:06:05.691 --> 02:06:09.128
ELDERLY. PAROLE BECAUSE WE KNOW

02:06:09.194 --> 02:06:10.863
THAT PEOPLE WHEN THEY REACH A

02:06:10.930 --> 02:06:13.432
CERTAIN AGE ARE- MUCH LESS

02:06:13.499 --> 02:06:16.602
LIKELY TO COMMIT CRIMES AND-

02:06:16.669 --> 02:06:18.404
AND TO ENGAGE IN RECIDIVISM.

02:06:18.470 --> 02:06:19.138
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THESE

02:06:19.204 --> 02:06:20.973
PEOPLE WILL BE AUTOMATICALLY

02:06:21.040 --> 02:06:23.175
PAROLED AND I KNOW IT IS. AND

02:06:23.242 --> 02:06:25.144
IT CAN BE TRAUMATIZING FOR A

02:06:25.210 --> 02:06:27.646
VICTIM TO PARTICIPATE IN A

02:06:27.713 --> 02:06:29.415
PAROLE HEARING I'M NOT IN ANY

02:06:29.481 --> 02:06:33.218
WAY- DISPUTING THAT OR OR OR

02:06:33.285 --> 02:06:36.622
DENYING THAT- BUT THAT'S THE

02:06:36.689 --> 02:06:38.324
SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE THE PEOPLE-

02:06:38.390 --> 02:06:40.859
ARE ENTITLED TO A SEAT RELEASE

02:06:40.926 --> 02:06:44.730
AND- AND I DO I JUST DON'T SEE.

02:06:44.797 --> 02:06:47.333
A REASON TO EXCLUDE THIS ONE

02:06:47.399 --> 02:06:49.068
CATEGORY OF CRIMES WHEN THERE

02:06:49.134 --> 02:06:50.903

CRIMES THAT ARE THAT ARE ALSO

02:06:52.771 --> 02:06:54.640
INCREDIBLY HEINOUS BUT PEOPLE

02:06:54.707 --> 02:06:56.041
ARE ABLE IF THEY'RE SERVED AT

02:06:56.108 --> 02:06:58.010

02:06:58.077 --> 02:07:00.245
CRITERIA CAN BE CONSIDERED BUT

02:59:20.616 --> 02:59:26.422
IMPORTANT. SO I'M- MISTER THIS

02:59:26.489 --> 02:59:28.791
STERN AYE X. HAVE A FOR YOU I'M

02:59:28.858 --> 02:59:30.459
MIGHT BE CONFUSED I ACTUALLY

02:59:30.526 --> 02:59:31.927
THOUGHT THIS WAS A BILL ABOUT

02:59:31.994 --> 02:59:36.398
LIVE MARKETS- AND I WAS WANTING

02:59:36.465 --> 02:59:37.333
IF YOU COULD ADDRESS THE

02:59:37.399 --> 02:59:39.135
CONCERNS RAISED BY THE

02:59:39.201 --> 02:59:41.904
TEAMSTERS AND BY THOSE FOLKS IN

02:59:41.971 --> 02:59:43.906
THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY

02:59:43.973 --> 02:59:46.408
BECAUSE I WAS SURPRISED TO GET

02:59:46.475 --> 02:59:47.710
THE NUMBER OF CALLS THAT I GOT

02:59:47.776 --> 02:59:50.012
FROM THEM ADDRESSING ASPECTS OF

02:59:50.079 --> 02:59:51.680
THIS BILL THAT THEY WERE IN

02:59:51.747 --> 02:59:53.883
CONFLICT WITH AND THAT WASN'T

02:59:53.949 --> 02:59:56.418
WHAT MY ASSUMPTION WAS ABOUT

02:59:56.485 --> 03:00:00.022
THE BILL FOR ITS INTENDS- AND

03:00:00.089 --> 03:00:03.292
SO NOW I'M- SLIGHTLY CONFUSED

03:00:03.359 --> 03:00:05.027
AND I THINK IT WOULD ALSO BE

03:00:05.094 --> 03:00:07.363
HELPFUL IF YOU COULD GO OVER-

03:00:07.429 --> 03:00:08.998
THE SPECIFIC AMENDMENTS THAT

03:00:09.064 --> 03:00:11.467
YOU DID EXCEPT BECAUSE I KNOW

03:00:11.534 --> 03:00:12.835
THEY HAD ALSO TALKED ABOUT

03:00:12.902 --> 03:00:14.970
AMENDMENTS. AND IT SEEMS LIKE

03:00:15.037 --> 03:00:16.438
THOSE HAVE NOT MADE IT INTO THE

03:00:16.505 --> 03:00:18.374
BILL AND SO I THINK THAT WOULD

03:00:18.440 --> 03:00:19.875
BE HELPFUL JUST TO CLARIFY THAT

03:00:19.942 --> 03:00:22.444
AT LEAST FOR ME BECAUSE MY

03:00:22.511 --> 03:00:23.279
UNDERSTANDING WAS THIS WAS

03:00:23.345 --> 03:00:25.748
ABOUT ONCE AGAIN LIVE MARKETS

AND WHAT SOLD THERE AND THE

03:00:29.084 --> 03:00:30.486
FACT THAT THIS SEEMS TO STILL

03:00:30.553 --> 03:00:32.388
BE BLEEDING OUT INTO OTHER

03:00:32.454 --> 03:00:37.660
INDUSTRIES- IT WOULD BE HELPFUL.

03:00:37.726 --> 03:00:39.461

MAIL THESE PER MAN. AND THEN IT

03:11:15.664 --> 03:11:17.332
THAT RESTRICTED THEY WOULD END

03:11:17.399 --> 03:11:18.700
UP ON THAT WRIST SPEED LIST

03:11:18.767 --> 03:11:22.804

STUDY- AND THEY THEY WANTED TO

03:12:56.564 --> 03:12:59.100
POSITION NOT TO BE A PART OF

THE BILL. AND I'M NOT SURE AND

03:13:02.237 --> 03:13:03.405
WE CAN GO BACK TO THE MATH IF

REVIEWED EVIDENCE I THINK IT IT

03:13:21.523 --> 03:13:23.792
JUST TAKES TOO LONG TO GET THAT

03:13:23.858 --> 03:13:24.359
KIND OF STUDY DONE AND IT'S

03:13:24.426 --> 03:13:27.329
REALLY NOT. WHAT IS THAT THE

HOPE WE'RE LOOKING FOR WE WANT

03:13:28.730 --> 03:13:29.898
JUST SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO

03:13:29.965 --> 03:13:31.232
BE NIMBLE ENOUGH TO ADDRESS A

03:13:31.299 --> 03:13:33.568
MAJOR PANDEMIC OUTBREAK. SO

03:13:33.635 --> 03:13:34.302
THAT'S WHY WE'RE BASING ON

03:13:34.369 --> 03:13:35.670
SCIENTIFIC NOT THE PEER

03:13:35.737 --> 03:13:37.339
REVIEWED BUT AGAIN I'M I'M VERY

03:13:37.405 --> 03:13:39.808
UP FOR WORKING THROUGH ALL THAT

03:13:39.874 --> 03:13:41.876
WITH THE- WITH THOSE CONCERNS.

03:13:41.943 --> 03:13:45.280
THE SENATOR STERN. YEAH WIENER.

03:13:45.347 --> 03:13:47.515
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN- SO

03:13:47.582 --> 03:13:49.818
THIS IS THIS IS AN IMPORTANT

03:13:49.884 --> 03:13:51.553
ISSUE BUT I'M A LITTLE. LITTLE

03:13:51.619 --> 03:13:53.321
BIT CONFUSE AND SENDING OUT

03:13:53.388 --> 03:13:56.558
SOME CLARITY SO WHEN IT COMES

03:13:56.624 --> 03:14:00.095
TO AND WE KNOW THAT- VIRUSES-

03:14:00.161 --> 03:14:01.529
THAT'S WHERE FOLKS NOTING

03:14:01.596 --> 03:14:02.230
VIRUSES BUT ALSO CAN BE

03:14:02.297 --> 03:14:04.432
BACTERIA. CAN JUMP BACK AND

03:14:04.499 --> 03:14:07.235
FORTH BETWEEN SPECIES AND

03:14:07.302 --> 03:14:09.337
THAT'S ALWAYS. IN THE CASE OF

03:14:09.404 --> 03:14:10.972
DOMESTICATED ANIMALS AND WILD

03:14:11.039 --> 03:14:15.076
ANIMALS- AND IT'S- YOU KNOW WE

03:14:15.143 --> 03:14:18.146
KNOW. FOR EXAMPLE THAT HIV-

03:14:18.213 --> 03:14:21.783
CAME FROM- FROM A JUMP FROM WE

03:14:21.850 --> 03:14:24.619
THINK FROM HEAPS TO HUMANS- AND

03:14:24.686 --> 03:14:27.155
THEN STARTS TO SPREAD. THE ONE

03:14:27.222 --> 03:14:29.224
OF THE CHALLENGES WE OFTEN IT

03:14:29.290 --> 03:14:31.793
WOULD BE PROBABLY PRETTY

03:14:31.860 --> 03:14:32.394
EXCEPTIONAL THAT WE WOULD KNOW

03:14:32.460 --> 03:14:35.563
THAT. QUICKLY ENOUGH TO ISOLATE

03:14:35.630 --> 03:14:36.798
HER KEEP AWAY FROM THOSE

03:14:36.865 --> 03:14:39.501
ANIMALS BEFORE IT SPREADS SO

03:14:39.567 --> 03:14:41.903
WITH HIV I THINK IT HAD

03:14:41.970 --> 03:14:44.439
PROBABLY JUMPED DECADES. BEFORE

03:14:44.506 --> 03:14:46.074
WE EVEN KNEW WHAT HIV WAS I

03:14:46.141 --> 03:14:46.741
THINK IT WAS LIKE IN THE

03:14:46.808 --> 03:14:48.443
THIRTIES OR FORTIES SAY THEY

03:14:48.510 --> 03:14:51.312
THEY THANK BUT IT JUMPED FROM I

03:14:51.379 --> 03:14:52.080
THINK IT WAS CHIMPANZEES TO

03:14:52.147 --> 03:14:54.149
HUMANS. AND THEN WE DON'T

03:14:54.215 --> 03:14:55.150
REALLY KNOW WHAT HE SAID HE WAS

03:14:55.216 --> 03:14:57.318
UNTIL LIKE NINETEEN EIGHTY

03:14:57.385 --> 03:14:58.820
EIGHTY ONE. BY THE TIME WE HAD

03:14:58.887 --> 03:15:00.422
THE FIRST INDICATION SO MANY

03:15:00.488 --> 03:15:02.257
YEARS LATER OBVIOUSLY WAY TOO

03:15:02.323 --> 03:15:04.759
LATE TO DO ANYTHING- ABOUT

03:15:04.826 --> 03:15:07.328
CHIMPANZEES AND HIV- AND WITH

03:15:07.395 --> 03:15:09.798
CODED- YOU KNOW AT THE

03:15:09.864 --> 03:15:12.867
BEGINNING THERE WAS A- MEDIA

03:15:12.934 --> 03:15:14.803
SORT OF. I DON'T KNOW HOW IT

03:15:14.869 --> 03:15:16.271
WAS A LITTLE BIT SPECULATIVE

03:15:16.337 --> 03:15:19.574
ABOUT THE WET MARKET AND- AND

03:15:19.641 --> 03:15:20.675
WHAT I UNDER ALL WITH DIFFERENT

03:15:20.742 --> 03:15:22.577
OPINIONS ABOUT WHICH ANIMALS IT

03:15:22.644 --> 03:15:23.678
MIGHT HAVE COME FROM OTHER WAS

03:15:23.745 --> 03:15:27.082
FROM A DOCTOR FROM A PACK.-PANGOLIN THE FROM PRONOUNCING

03:15:27.148 --> 03:15:30.351
IT. CORRECTLY AND BY THE TIME

03:15:30.418 --> 03:15:31.586
AND FRANKLY BY THE TIME WE WERE

03:15:31.653 --> 03:15:33.388
EVEN TALKING ABOUT THAT CODE

03:15:33.455 --> 03:15:35.457
WAS ALREADY LIKE OUT THE GATES

03:15:35.523 --> 03:15:37.859
AND BECAUSE OF INCOMPETENCE. IN

03:15:37.926 --> 03:15:39.194
VARIOUS COUNTRIES INCLUDING OUR

03:15:39.260 --> 03:15:43.131
OWN- IT WAS ALLOWED TO SPREAD.

03:15:43.198 --> 03:15:45.400
SO I DON'T KNOW. HERE E. A LOT

03:15:45.467 --> 03:15:46.968
OF TIMES ONCE WE REALIZE THAT

03:15:47.035 --> 03:15:48.770
THERE ISN'T THAT THERE IS. A

03:15:48.837 --> 03:15:50.371
REASONABLE CHANCE THAT

03:15:50.438 --> 03:15:54.209
TAXONOMISTS IS THE SOURCE OF

03:15:54.275 --> 03:15:56.211
THE VIRUS THEY MIGHT BE. MONTHS

03:15:56.277 --> 03:15:58.546
OR YEARS OR EVEN DECADES LATER

03:15:58.613 --> 03:16:01.449
WHEN IT'S TOO LATE. TO STOP THE

03:16:01.516 --> 03:16:03.618
SPREAD. AND THAT. DOESN'T MEAN

03:16:03.685 --> 03:16:05.620
WE SHOULDN'T DO SOMETHING ABOUT

03:16:05.687 --> 03:16:06.488
IT BUT I JUST WANT A CERTAIN

03:16:06.554 --> 03:16:08.756
NOTE THAT- THAT IT'S NOT IT'S

03:16:08.823 --> 03:16:10.525
NOT LIKE A BROOM THE SENATE WAS

03:16:10.592 --> 03:16:12.127
DOING AND WE TO SEAL IT OFF AND

03:16:12.193 --> 03:16:13.661
IT'S FIXED OBVIOUSLY THAT.

03:16:13.728 --> 03:16:16.231
DIDN'T WORK WITH COVETED DIDN'T

DOES IT HAVE TO ONLY BE A

03:17:02.010 --> 03:17:04.746
SERIOUS DISEASE- BECAUSE THERE

03:17:04.812 --> 03:17:06.748
COULD BE DISEASES THAT. COME

03:17:06.814 --> 03:17:08.349
FROM AN ANIMAL THAT ARE ARE

03:17:08.416 --> 03:17:11.152

WITH THIS OKAY. YEAH THANK YOU

03:17:44.185 --> 03:17:45.787
YES FOR CLARITY ON WHAT THE

03:17:45.853 --> 03:17:48.223
BILL TRYING TO DO AND STOP OR

03:17:48.289 --> 03:17:49.958
START AN EARLIER QUESTION ON

03:17:50.024 --> 03:17:53.094
LIFE MARKETS VERSUS OTHER PARK-

03:17:53.161 --> 03:17:54.329
MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT READ

03:17:54.395 --> 03:17:56.664
MORE BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE IS

03:17:56.731 --> 03:17:57.265
THAT A PORTION OF THE EXISTING

03:17:57.332 --> 03:18:00.134
LAW. DEALING WITH LIFE MARKETS

03:18:00.201 --> 03:18:02.303
IT'S PART OF THE PENAL CODE-

03:18:02.370 --> 03:18:04.172
THE QUESTION IS EXISTING LAW

03:18:04.239 --> 03:18:06.307
THAT DEALS WITH WILDLIFE IMPORT

03:18:06.374 --> 03:18:07.542
MORE BROADLY PART OF THE

03:18:07.609 --> 03:18:09.244
FISHING GAME AND THAT'S WHY THE

03:18:09.310 --> 03:18:13.681
BILL ANALYSIS THAT YOU THOUGHT.

03:18:13.748 --> 03:18:14.282
ABOUT THIS ON THE LIVE MARKETS

03:18:14.349 --> 03:18:17.452
PART IN-

03:18:17.518 --> 03:18:19.587
COMMITTEE EXISTING LAW ALREADY

03:18:19.654 --> 03:18:22.123
CREATE RESTRICTED SPEECHLESS I

03:18:22.190 --> 03:18:24.292
HAVE A PROVISIONS REQUIRE

03:18:24.359 --> 03:18:25.627
PROHIBITED SPECIES. THE

03:18:25.693 --> 03:18:27.595
RESTRICTED SPECIES LEFT UNDER

03:18:27.662 --> 03:18:29.297
EXISTING LAW TALK ABOUT PUBLIC

03:18:29.364 --> 03:18:30.932
SAFETY THE PART OF THE LANGUAGE

03:18:30.999 --> 03:18:32.100
IN HERE IS TO ENSURE THAT

03:18:32.166 --> 03:18:34.636
PUBLIC HEALTH IS ALSO A FACTOR

03:18:34.702 --> 03:18:36.137
IN WHETHER OR NOT TO PUT A

03:18:36.204 --> 03:18:38.139
SPECIES ON THE RESTRICTED LIST

03:18:38.206 --> 03:18:39.407
AS WELL AS WEATHER CONDITIONS

03:18:39.474 --> 03:18:41.876
PERMIT OR NOT- THE PROHIBITED

03:18:41.943 --> 03:18:44.279
SPECIES LIST WHICH IS STRICTER-

03:18:44.345 --> 03:18:45.613
HAS NEVER BEEN IMPLEMENTED

03:18:45.680 --> 03:18:46.814
THAT'S WHY THE PORTION OF THE

03:18:46.881 --> 03:18:47.682
BILL THAT CUTS THAT DEADLINES

03:18:47.749 --> 03:18:49.250
IN THEIR- SEARCH SOMEONE ELSE

03:18:49.317 --> 03:18:51.419
QUESTION- IT THE MOST RECENT

03:18:51.486 --> 03:18:53.288
QUESTION OF THE DAY. THAT

03:18:53.354 --> 03:18:57.592
NUMBER ONE VERSUS NUMBER. THREE

03:18:57.659 --> 03:18:59.294
INFECTION FEET. I THE IDEA THAT

03:18:59.360 --> 03:19:00.962
IS IF THERE'S A SPECIES THAT'S

03:19:01.029 --> 03:19:02.664
BEEN DETERMINED TO BE

03:19:02.730 --> 03:19:04.265
CRITICALLY HIGHER. THAT THIS

03:19:04.332 --> 03:19:05.566
GIVE THE AUTHORITY TO ACTUALLY

03:19:05.633 --> 03:19:07.769
SUSPEND PERMITS YES IF THE

03:19:07.835 --> 03:19:10.405
ANIMALS ARE ALREADY CIRCULATING

03:19:10.471 --> 03:19:12.640
OUT THERE- OR IF THERE'S A

03:19:12.707 --> 03:19:14.676
PERMIT FOR MULTI YEAR. A PERMIT

03:19:14.742 --> 03:19:15.977
THAT ALLOW THAT ALREADY BEEN

03:19:16.044 --> 03:19:17.278
ISSUED THAT ALLOWS IMPORTATION

03:19:17.345 --> 03:19:18.579
BUT IT HASN'T HAPPENED YET

03:19:18.646 --> 03:19:20.915
THAT'S WHAT ONE IS ABOUT- PRINT

03:19:20.982 --> 03:19:24.185
THREE. IS THE IDEA THAT CERTAIN

03:19:24.252 --> 03:19:26.020
SPECIES ARE HIGHER RISK OR NOT.

03:19:26.087 --> 03:19:29.657
SO THAT THE COURT ON THE LAST

03:19:29.724 --> 03:19:31.359
THE IDEA IS YOU CANNOT. THEY'RE

03:19:31.426 --> 03:19:32.360
ON THE LIST THE REASON THAT

03:19:32.427 --> 03:19:34.829
THE- YOU CANNOT ISSUE A PERMIT

03:19:34.896 --> 03:19:37.865
UNLESS. THE ENTITY RECEIVING

03:19:37.932 --> 03:19:41.002
THEM HAS. THE ABILITY TO DO THE

03:19:41.069 --> 03:19:42.804
TREATMENT TESTING QUARANTINE

03:19:42.870 --> 03:19:46.207
THINGS OF THAT SORT- AND SO. IN

03:19:46.274 --> 03:19:47.008
THAT SENSE IT'S NOT A TRUE

03:19:47.075 --> 03:19:50.678
PROHIBITION IT'S A PROHIBITION.

03:19:50.745 --> 03:19:51.746
UNLESS YOU CAN DEAL WITH IT YOU

03:19:51.813 --> 03:19:52.847
KNOW WHAT YOU'RE COMMONSENSE

03:19:52.914 --> 03:19:55.616
EIGHTY METRIC- AND THEN PERHAPS

03:19:55.683 --> 03:20:07.495
THAT THE LAST THING I WOULD TRY.

03:20:07.562 --> 03:20:08.129
TO CLARIFY ON THE QUESTIONNAIRE

03:20:08.196 --> 03:20:12.467
AS A. M. C. A. AZS EXEMPTION.

03:20:12.533 --> 03:20:13.801
AND AVIATORS BURKE A LARGE

03:20:13.868 --> 03:20:16.104
SUITS LIKE AND EAGER TARA THAT

03:20:16.170 --> 03:20:17.705
INDICATIVE LAW SO THIS BILL

03:20:17.772 --> 03:20:21.075
DOES NOT CHANGE THAT ALL- THE

03:20:21.142 --> 03:20:21.609
END THAT THAT TAKES UNDER

03:20:21.676 --> 03:20:23.077
EXISTING. IS PART OF CALIFORNIA

03:20:23.144 --> 03:20:25.179
MANY STAY THAT CAN FEDERAL LAW-

03:20:25.246 --> 03:20:25.913
THAT'S LONG BEEN WRECKED WE DO

03:20:25.980 --> 03:20:27.315
NOT WANT TO CHANGE THAT AT A

03:20:27.382 --> 03:20:28.816
PRACTICAL MAN THE COME. BY THE

03:20:28.883 --> 03:20:30.785
SMALLER THE- CREATE ALMOST

03:20:30.852 --> 03:20:34.422
DOESN'T REALLY MATTER BE. THE

03:20:34.489 --> 03:20:36.657
AS THE ACRE EXISTING ADA. GOES

03:20:36.724 --> 03:20:38.259
AWAY FOR SPECIES THAT ARE. AT

03:20:38.326 --> 03:20:39.861
HIGH RISK AND SO THEY WILL NEED

03:20:39.927 --> 03:20:41.262
PERMITS TO SO REALLY THE

03:20:41.329 --> 03:20:44.966
OPPOSITION- ON THAT IS. YOU'RE

03:20:45.032 --> 03:20:47.702
NOT. NOT UNDERSTANDING THEIR-

03:20:47.769 --> 03:20:50.438
ADMITTEDLY COMPLICATED EXISTING

03:20:50.505 --> 03:20:53.207
LAW- ARE MISCHARACTERIZING I

03:20:53.274 --> 03:20:54.175
DON'T THINK IT WILL HAVE ANY OF

03:20:54.242 --> 03:20:55.810

03:21:52.800 --> 03:21:53.234
TAKING THAT ACTION WOULD

03:21:53.301 --> 03:21:57.071

LATE BUT THERE ARE CATEGORIES

03:22:22.196 --> 03:22:23.764
OF SPECIES THAT WE KNOW ARE

03:22:23.831 --> 03:22:25.833
HIGH RISK PARTIAL BATHS WHICH-

03:22:25.900 --> 03:22:28.202
ALMOST CERTAINLY IS THE ORIGIN

03:22:28.269 --> 03:22:29.504
SOURCE OF HOPE AND HAVE

03:22:29.570 --> 03:22:32.406
IDENTIFIED BY THE RECENT WORLD

WHOLE CATEGORY PATH SHOULD

03:22:38.145 --> 03:22:38.946
PROBABLY BE PUT ON THE

03:22:39.013 --> 03:22:40.548
PROHIBITED SPECIES LEFT WHERE

INSTITUTE IN THE US

03:22:45.453 --> 03:22:46.153
SPECIFICALLY TO LOOK AT THE

PIZZA- FOR SPECIES LIKE THAT WE

03:22:49.657 --> 03:22:51.025

THAT PARTICULAR OUTBREAK BUT

03:23:03.137 --> 03:23:04.305
THAT WOULD ELEVATE THAT

03:23:04.372 --> 03:23:06.741
CATEGORY OF ANIMALS TWO ONE FOR

03:23:06.807 --> 03:23:08.910
HARBOR DISEASES. THAT ARE

03:23:08.976 --> 03:23:10.545
READILY TRANSMISSIBLE HUMANS

03:23:10.611 --> 03:23:11.546
THAT WOULD PUT THEM ON THE

03:23:11.612 --> 03:23:12.847
RESTRICTED LIST IF THEY'RE NOT

03:23:12.914 --> 03:23:15.483
ALREADY THERE AND YOU KNOW IT

03:23:15.550 --> 03:23:16.684

GET A PERMIT FOR SO IT IT. IT

03:23:19.921 --> 03:23:21.422

03:24:23.184 --> 03:24:23.751
MAYBE CONSIDERING MAKING THIS A

03:24:23.818 --> 03:24:27.855
TO YOUR BILL- I HAD NOT

03:24:27.922 --> 03:24:32.393
CONSIDERED THAT- YOU KNOW GIVEN

03:24:32.460 --> 03:24:35.262
THE GIVEN THE URGENCY OF THIS

03:24:35.329 --> 03:24:37.264
PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS WORD JUST

03:24:37.331 --> 03:24:39.266
GETTING THROUGH I'M REALLY. I

03:24:39.333 --> 03:24:41.969

03:24:45.973 --> 03:24:47.274
SUPPORT THE MEASURE THAT AND

03:24:47.341 --> 03:24:48.376
SEEK RECONSIDERATION AT THAT

03:24:48.442 --> 03:24:51.379
POINT BUT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT-

03:24:51.445 --> 03:24:52.580
THE MATTER AS SUFFICIENT

03:24:52.647 --> 03:24:54.615
URGENCY THAT IT IT PROBABLY

03:24:54.682 --> 03:24:56.317
DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO WAIT WE

03:24:56.384 --> 03:24:57.618

QUICKLY ENOUGH SO- I GET THAT

03:25:19.240 --> 03:25:20.474
NEW THINGS COME TO LIGHT BUT

03:25:20.541 --> 03:25:22.243
I'M HOPING THAT THE URGENCY

03:25:22.309 --> 03:25:23.444

THAT POINT IN YOUR- COMMENTS IT

03:50:19.772 --> 03:50:21.340
JUST DOESN'T MAKE SENSE SO THIS

03:50:21.407 --> 03:50:24.844

ON THIS MEASURE CENTER DROVE

03:50:30.082 --> 03:50:34.453
OFF. SO I'M JUST KIND OF

03:50:34.520 --> 03:50:41.727
CURIOUS AS. TO Y. V. THE NOTION

03:50:41.794 --> 03:50:47.033
OF. SEEKING TO REMOVE THESE-

03:50:47.099 --> 03:50:50.636
THESE- ENHANCEMENTS TO TREAT

03:50:50.703 --> 03:50:54.574

THAT IF IT'S A REPEAT OFFENDER.

03:51:07.420 --> 03:51:09.222
THE CONSEQUENCES SHOULD BE

03:51:09.288 --> 03:51:13.326
STRICTER. ON THAT AND NOT NOT

03:51:13.392 --> 03:51:17.129
LESS RESTRICTIVE ON THAT AND-

03:51:17.196 --> 03:51:18.164
I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE

03:51:18.231 --> 03:51:21.067
LOGIC BEHIND THIS BILL- BECAUSE

03:51:21.133 --> 03:51:23.502
I IN MY MIND IT TO RELEASE IS

03:51:23.569 --> 03:51:27.173
NOT MAKING. SENSE ESPECIALLY

03:51:27.240 --> 03:51:27.673
WHEN IT COMES TO REPEAT

03:51:27.740 --> 03:51:29.475
OFFENDERS I CAN I CAN. FENTON

03:51:29.542 --> 03:51:30.943
THE NOTION OF THE UNDERSTANDING

03:51:31.010 --> 03:51:32.478

03:51:34.146 --> 03:51:38.451
REPEAT OFFENDER. THE FIFTY TWO

03:51:43.689 --> 03:51:46.792
IN JUNE. R. J. A. U. GRAZING A

03:51:46.859 --> 03:51:48.661

THIRTY SIX OR OR IS IT IS YOUR

03:51:53.299 --> 03:51:54.367
CONCERN WITH. NOW THAT THOSE

03:51:54.433 --> 03:51:57.003
HAVE BEEN PASSED- WHICH SET THE

03:51:57.069 --> 03:51:58.938
STANDARD FOR REPEAT OFFENDERS.

03:51:59.005 --> 03:52:01.407
IT FILE IN A LIMITED WAY

03:52:01.474 --> 03:52:02.041
BECAUSE THERE'S OTHER WAYS THAT

03:52:02.108 --> 03:52:04.543
PEOPLE'S. DEFENDERS SENTENCES

03:52:04.610 --> 03:52:06.312

IT EVEN UNDER CURRENT LAW ALL

03:52:08.314 --> 03:52:09.849
WE'RE DOING HERE IS HE'S

03:52:09.915 --> 03:52:11.884
APPLYING THE EXISTING LAW

03:52:11.951 --> 03:52:14.120
RETROACTIVELY. SO THAT SO THAT

03:52:14.186 --> 03:52:17.857
PEOPLE ARE NOT. COULD BE GIVEN

03:52:17.923 --> 03:52:20.426
A OF A LONGER SENTENCE JUST

03:52:20.493 --> 03:52:23.029
BECAUSE THEY WERE CONVICTED IN

03:52:23.095 --> 03:52:24.096
TWENTY SIXTEEN AS OPPOSED TO

03:52:24.163 --> 03:52:25.865
TWENTY TWENTY TWO. SO NOW IF

03:52:25.931 --> 03:52:26.899
YOUR IF YOUR QUESTION IS ABOUT

03:52:26.966 --> 03:52:28.567
THE BROADER QUESTION WHY IT IS

WE REPEALED- THE SENTENCE

03:52:30.569 --> 03:52:32.171
ENHANCEMENTS FOR CERTAIN TYPES

03:52:32.238 --> 03:52:34.006
OF REPEAT OFFENSE WE I MEAN I

03:52:34.073 --> 03:52:35.241
CAN WE CAN. HEAR YOU HAVE WE

03:52:35.308 --> 03:52:36.942
GOT SEVERAL PEOPLE ON THIS

03:52:37.009 --> 03:52:39.378
COMMITTEE YOU CAN SPEAK-ELOQUENTLY ABOUT- WHY IT WAS

03:52:39.445 --> 03:52:41.080
SUCH AN IMPORTANT PRIORITY FOR

03:52:41.147 --> 03:52:42.014
NASA THIS COMMITTEE FOR THE

03:52:42.081 --> 03:52:45.117
SENATE. I BELIEVE THAT IS THAT

03:52:45.184 --> 03:52:45.751
WHAT YOU'RE FOCUSED ON OR OR IS

03:52:45.818 --> 03:52:50.156
IT. YES SOME BOTH ON THAT ON

03:52:50.222 --> 03:52:51.757
THAT AND RETROACTIVELY AND

03:52:51.824 --> 03:52:53.459
BECAUSE I MEAN THIS IS.

03:52:53.526 --> 03:52:54.060
OBVIOUSLY A FOLLOW UP TO THAT

03:52:54.126 --> 03:52:58.764
BUT- IN ESSENCE IT'S STILL.

03:52:58.831 --> 03:53:00.700
YOUR ADDRESSING THE ISSUES OF

03:53:00.766 --> 03:53:02.835
REPEAT OFFENDERS RIGHT WOULD

03:53:02.902 --> 03:53:03.936
YOU DO WHAT DO WOULD YOU MIND

03:53:04.003 --> 03:53:05.471
IF I ASK OUR COLLEAGUE WHO WHO

03:53:05.538 --> 03:53:07.406
CARRIED THE BILL ON THIS-

03:53:07.473 --> 03:53:11.877
CENTER WINNER. ABSOLUTELY SO.

03:53:11.944 --> 03:53:13.479
SO FIRST OF ALL JUDGES ALREADY

03:53:13.546 --> 03:53:14.814
HAVE THERE'S A RANGE OF

03:53:14.880 --> 03:53:16.549
SENTENCES EVERY SET EVERY

03:53:16.615 --> 03:53:18.684
FELONY THEY COMMITTED AS A LOW

03:53:18.751 --> 03:53:21.153
MIDDLE AND HIGH ENDS WHERE THEY

03:53:21.220 --> 03:53:22.488
CAN SOLICIT MY IDEA I'M JUST

03:53:22.555 --> 03:53:24.056
MAKING THIS UP TO TWO YEARS

03:53:24.123 --> 03:53:25.057
THREE YEARS FOUR YEARS

03:53:25.124 --> 03:53:27.126
DEPENDING ON THE CIRCUMSTANCES

03:53:27.193 --> 03:53:28.761
AND SO THE JUDGE CAN ALREADY

03:53:28.828 --> 03:53:32.031
LOOK BACK AT SOMEONE'S RECORD

03:53:32.098 --> 03:53:32.865
IN ADDITION THE CIRCUMSTANCES

03:53:32.932 --> 03:53:34.867
OF THE CRIME AND SIGNS ON THE

03:53:34.934 --> 03:53:36.669
HIGH END OF THE RANGE OR THE

03:53:36.736 --> 03:53:39.004
LOW END OF THE RANGE SUGGESTS

03:53:39.071 --> 03:53:40.973
JUDGES ALREADY HAVE DISCRETION.

03:53:41.040 --> 03:53:42.875
IN ADDITION WHEN YOU COMMIT A

03:53:42.942 --> 03:53:45.177
CRIME YOU HAVE THE SENTENCE FOR

03:53:45.244 --> 03:53:47.046
THAT FOR THAT CRIME AND THAT IS

03:53:47.113 --> 03:53:49.148
WHAT IT IS IF YOU ALREADY DID

03:53:49.215 --> 03:53:51.517
THE TIME FOR LAST CRIME THE

03:53:51.584 --> 03:53:53.419
THINKING AS IF YOU DID THE TIME

03:53:53.486 --> 03:53:55.488
WHATEVER THE LAW CENTER LAST

03:53:55.554 --> 03:53:57.456
CRIME. BUT SAY WHATEVER EITHER

03:53:57.523 --> 03:53:58.557
TEN YEARS LATER YOU COMMIT

03:53:58.624 --> 03:54:00.626
ANOTHER CRIME YOU DO THE QUOTE

03:54:00.693 --> 03:54:03.429
THAT THE TIME FOR THAT THESE

03:54:03.496 --> 03:54:05.231
ENHANCEMENTS WERE ESPECIALLY

03:54:05.297 --> 03:54:06.365
THE ONE YOU'RE IN HOUSING WHICH

03:54:06.432 --> 03:54:08.033
IS A BILL THAT I CARRIED TENDED

03:54:08.100 --> 03:54:10.636
TO BE FOR LOWER LEVEL OFFENSES

03:54:10.703 --> 03:54:13.105

ENHANCEMENTS THAT ARE MORE

03:54:18.244 --> 03:54:19.378
SERIOUS SO WHAT THIS IS DOING

WAS OFTEN TURNING LOW LEVEL

03:54:22.214 --> 03:54:24.784
CRIMES- INTO A VERY LONG

03:54:24.850 --> 03:54:27.953
