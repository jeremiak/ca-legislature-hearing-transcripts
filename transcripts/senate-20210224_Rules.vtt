00:14:26.065 --> 00:14:28.100
LAST YEAR DESPITE PEOPLE'S

00:14:28.167 --> 00:14:30.336
JUDGMENT WE FACED SIGNIFICANT

00:14:30.402 --> 00:14:31.837
CHALLENGES IN PROVIDING THAT

00:14:31.904 --> 00:14:33.772
RELIABILITY IT'S HARD FOR US

00:14:33.839 --> 00:14:36.208
TO. DETERMINE THAT BOTH WITH

00:14:36.275 --> 00:14:37.876
RESPECT TO THE TRANSITIONS AND

00:14:37.943 --> 00:14:39.979
HAVING BACK UP POWER IN

00:14:40.045 --> 00:14:41.981
BATTERIES THAT ONLY LAST A FEW

00:14:42.047 --> 00:14:42.848
HOURS AND ALL OF THE OTHER

00:14:42.915 --> 00:14:44.617
ISSUES AND TECHNOLOGICAL ISSUES

00:14:44.683 --> 00:14:45.718
THAT WE'RE FACING SO I WANTED

00:14:45.784 --> 00:14:47.753

OCTOBER NOVEMBER. EVENT THAT

00:15:01.667 --> 00:15:03.135
COULD HAVE A VERY SIGNIFICANT

00:15:03.202 --> 00:15:05.437
IMPACT ON RELIABILITY. AND

00:15:05.504 --> 00:15:06.538
THERE'S ALSO A WHOLE HOST OF

00:15:06.605 --> 00:15:08.574
OTHER ISSUES THAT ARE DEALING

00:15:08.641 --> 00:15:10.476
WITH TRYING TO CONVERT THE-

00:15:10.542 --> 00:15:12.378
GRID TO BE MORE GREENER THAN

00:15:12.444 --> 00:15:13.279
CONFUSE ME PROCUREMENT TO BE

00:15:13.345 --> 00:15:15.414

WANT TO MAKE THE POINT. AND YOU

00:15:29.395 --> 00:15:30.796
COULD ADDRESS THIS THAT THE

00:15:30.863 --> 00:15:33.265
MANAGEMENT OF OUR- ELECTRONS IF

00:15:33.332 --> 00:15:35.601
YOU WILL OR POWER IN COULD

00:15:35.668 --> 00:15:37.403
INCLUDE NATURAL GAS AND OTHERS.

00:15:37.469 --> 00:15:38.737
IS QUITE CHALLENGING BECAUSE WE

00:15:38.804 --> 00:15:40.306
HAVE THE ENERGY COMMISSION WE

00:15:40.372 --> 00:15:41.674
HAVE THE ENERGY IMBALANCE

00:15:41.740 --> 00:15:43.142

HOW DO YOU SEE OUR ABILITY TO

00:15:49.114 --> 00:15:51.283
WADE THROUGH THIS IF YOU EIGHTY

00:15:51.350 --> 00:15:53.719

00:15:54.386 --> 00:15:56.855
FIX IT. SO I. HAVE TO TAKE A

00:15:56.922 --> 00:15:58.524
FIRST SHOT SO I'M GONNA I THINK

00:15:58.590 --> 00:15:59.625
REPEAT SOMETHINGS THAT ENTERING

00:15:59.692 --> 00:16:00.759
THE SENATE EARLIER WHICH I

00:16:00.826 --> 00:16:02.728
FULLY AGREE WITH. WHICH IS OF

00:16:02.795 --> 00:16:03.696
COURSE I'M WORRIED ABOUT

00:16:03.762 --> 00:16:05.064
RELIABILITY I THINK EVERYONE IS

00:16:05.130 --> 00:16:06.999
AND IT'S OUR PRIMARY JOB YEAH

00:16:07.066 --> 00:16:08.500
SO. AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE

00:16:08.567 --> 00:16:09.835
THAT WHAT HAPPENED NEXT LAST

00:16:09.902 --> 00:16:11.970
AUGUST DOESN'T HAPPEN AGAIN- I

00:16:12.037 --> 00:16:12.705
THINK WE'VE LEARNED SOME

00:16:12.771 --> 00:16:14.506
IMPORTANT LESSONS ONE OF WHICH

00:16:14.573 --> 00:16:17.242
IS. THE STORAGE CLEAN THINKING

00:16:17.309 --> 00:16:19.578
ABOUT RELIABILITY THE FOCUS HAS

00:16:19.645 --> 00:16:21.313
ALWAYS BEEN ON MID AFTERNOON ON

00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:23.782
HOT DAYS. WE'VE LEARNED THAT

00:16:23.849 --> 00:16:24.416
THAT'S NOT ENOUGH YOU NEED TO

00:16:24.483 --> 00:16:26.785
BE FOCUSING. FIRST OF ALL ON

00:16:26.852 --> 00:16:28.654
IT'S LATER IN THE EVENING.

00:16:28.721 --> 00:16:29.955
WHICH IS WHEN WE RAN INTO

00:16:30.022 --> 00:16:31.123
TROUBLE BUT REALLY WE NEED TO

00:16:31.190 --> 00:16:33.092
BE FOCUSING TWENTY FOUR SEVEN

00:16:33.158 --> 00:16:33.959
THREE SIXTY FIVE. TO MAKE SURE

00:16:34.026 --> 00:16:34.893
THAT WE HAVE RESOURCES

00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:36.695
AVAILABLE IT'S NO LONGER. THE

00:16:36.762 --> 00:16:37.663
WAY BUSINESS WAS DONE IN THE

00:16:37.730 --> 00:16:38.864
PAST IS NOT THE WAY IT'S GONG

00:16:38.931 --> 00:16:40.332
TO BE DONE IN THE FUTURE. AND

00:16:40.399 --> 00:16:42.167
WHAT THAT MEANS ABOVE ALL ELSE

00:16:42.234 --> 00:16:43.235
AGAIN COMPETING WITH ANGEL IN

00:16:43.302 --> 00:16:45.537
THE SENTENCE. WE NEED TO HAVE A

00:16:45.604 --> 00:16:47.639
MUCH MORE DIVERSE PORTFOLIO OF

00:16:47.706 --> 00:16:48.307
RESOURCES WE NEED TO BE

00:16:48.374 --> 00:16:49.808
FOCUSING ON THAT. GOING

00:16:49.875 --> 00:16:52.678
FORWARD. THAT IS NOT WITHIN OUR

00:16:52.745 --> 00:16:54.113
AUTHORITY AS THE HI SO

00:16:54.179 --> 00:16:55.814
PRIMARILY THAT IS PRIMARILY THE

00:16:55.881 --> 00:16:58.250
CPC'S AUTHORITY. BUT ONE OF THE

00:16:58.317 --> 00:16:59.618
THINGS THAT WE HAVE REALLY

YOU MENTIONED CENTER THERE ARE

00:17:06.492 --> 00:17:07.793
A LOT OF AGENCIES IN CALIFORNIA

MORE DEMOCRATIZED. AND ALL

00:17:39.725 --> 00:17:41.193
RESOURCES NEED TO REFLECT

00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:42.828
OPTIONS SO WE CANNOT STRESS

00:17:42.895 --> 00:17:45.264
ENOUGH THE NEED FOR DIFFERENT

00:17:45.330 --> 00:17:46.799
RESOURCES SO WE HAVE A VERY

00:17:46.865 --> 00:17:48.734
PORTFOLIO AND WE ARE NOT.

00:17:48.801 --> 00:17:50.035
STROLLER CENTRIC OVERLY

00:17:50.102 --> 00:17:51.837
DEPENDENT ON ONE RESOURCE WHICH

00:17:51.904 --> 00:17:53.639
CAN CAUSE PROBLEMS ESPECIALLY

00:17:53.705 --> 00:17:54.873
WITH FLEXIBILITY AT THE END OF

00:17:54.940 --> 00:17:57.543
THE DAY. WHEN WE NEED VERY FAST

WHICH IS WHERE OUR

00:18:02.114 --> 00:18:03.916
VULNERABILITY. SO CLIMATE

00:18:03.982 --> 00:18:05.584
CHANGE YES THAT IS AN ISSUE AND

00:18:05.651 --> 00:18:07.719
WE NEED TO BE FOCUSED ON MAKING

00:18:07.786 --> 00:18:08.921
SURE THAT WE CAN ADDRESS THE

00:18:08.987 --> 00:18:10.923

GREATER WEST. WHAT WAS REALLY

00:18:19.598 --> 00:18:21.200
DIFFERENT ABOUT THIS HUGE STORM

00:18:21.266 --> 00:18:22.401
THAT WE EXPERIENCED LAST YEAR

00:18:22.468 --> 00:18:24.403

00:21:04.162 --> 00:21:06.231
QUESTION IS TWO THINGS ONE.

00:21:06.298 --> 00:21:08.333
WHAT WHAT HOMEWORK HAVE YOU

00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:09.635
DONE WITH RESPECT TO

00:21:09.701 --> 00:21:12.371
COORDINATING WE MUST COORDINATE

00:21:12.437 --> 00:21:14.573
OKAY DID YOU DO IT. WHAT HAS IT

00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:15.907
BEEN IMPROVE WITH RESPECT TO

00:21:15.974 --> 00:21:16.875
THE ENERGY COMMISSION IN THE

00:21:16.942 --> 00:21:18.276
PEAK STEEP THE CALIFORNIA

00:21:18.343 --> 00:21:20.345
PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION. IF

00:21:20.412 --> 00:21:22.914
THE ANSWER IS YES TO HAVE YOU

00:21:22.981 --> 00:21:24.282
INCREASED YOUR RESOURCE

00:21:24.349 --> 00:21:26.652
ADEQUACY TO BE ABLE TO BE

00:21:26.718 --> 00:21:28.654
PREPARED FOR THE UNFORGETTABLE

00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:29.454
BECAUSE THAT'S THE ONLY WAY

00:21:29.521 --> 00:21:30.956
YOU'RE GONNA GET. BEING

00:21:31.023 --> 00:21:32.391
PREPARED FOR THE UNFORESEEABLE

00:21:32.457 --> 00:21:33.759
WANTED TO GET YOUR THOUGHTS ON

00:21:33.825 --> 00:21:34.326
THOSE THINGS AND I GUESS THE

00:21:34.393 --> 00:21:36.228
THIRD POINT IS. YOU KNOW I JUST

00:21:36.294 --> 00:21:37.963
THINK WE NEED IS A LEGISLATURE

00:21:38.030 --> 00:21:38.630
AND I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'RE

00:21:38.697 --> 00:21:39.831
GOING TO BE HAPPY ABOUT THIS

00:21:39.898 --> 00:21:41.233
AND I HAVEN'T DISCUSSES WITH

00:21:41.299 --> 00:21:43.435
PROTERRA. BUT MUCH MORE

00:21:43.502 --> 00:21:44.903
OVERSIGHT BECAUSE WE KEEP THE

00:21:44.970 --> 00:21:46.204
RISK IS JUST TOO HIGH TO ALL OF

00:21:46.271 --> 00:21:48.573
US. IN ENSURING THAT WE DON'T

00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:51.076
SEE THESE SITUATIONS AGAIN. IF

00:21:51.143 --> 00:21:54.146
YOU CAN JUST GIVE US SOME

00:21:54.212 --> 00:21:54.613
REACTIONS ON THOSE I'D

00:21:54.680 --> 00:21:56.114
APPRECIATE. I THINK I CAN SPEAK

00:21:56.181 --> 00:21:57.549
TO THE I. SEVEN THAT WE AREWE

00:21:57.616 --> 00:21:58.917
WELCOME DIALOGUE WITH THE

00:21:58.984 --> 00:22:00.485
LEGISLATURE ALL TYPES- AND

00:22:00.552 --> 00:22:02.888
THAT'S- AND I THINK. MANAGEMENT

00:22:02.954 --> 00:22:03.889
WOULD AGREE WITH THAT EVERYONE

00:22:03.955 --> 00:22:04.790
WOULD AGREE WITH THAT

00:22:04.856 --> 00:22:06.892
ABSOLUTELY A PARTNERSHIP. WE

00:22:06.958 --> 00:22:08.627
ARE WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH

00:22:08.694 --> 00:22:10.662
THE CPC OF OURS IS A PART TIME

00:22:10.729 --> 00:22:12.431
BOARD BUT THE CLEAR. HAVE BEEN

00:22:12.497 --> 00:22:13.832
STRONGLY PUSHING THE STAFF AND

00:22:13.899 --> 00:22:15.567
THEY HAVE BEEN ACTING. WORKING

00:22:15.634 --> 00:22:16.968
HARD I THINK THERE HAS BEEN

00:22:17.035 --> 00:22:20.038
PROGRESS AND THAT THE CPC.

00:22:20.105 --> 00:22:22.941
AFRICAN UNDERSTAND NOW WHAT THE

00:22:23.008 --> 00:22:26.244
CHALLENGES WE FACE ARE- WE ARE.

00:22:26.311 --> 00:22:27.312
AYE SO FOR EXAMPLE IS

00:22:27.379 --> 00:22:29.948
ADVOCATING THAT THE CPUC REYES.

00:22:30.015 --> 00:22:32.117
THE RESERVE MARGIN FROM FIFTEEN

00:22:32.184 --> 00:22:32.617
TO SEVENTEEN AND A HALF

00:22:32.684 --> 00:22:34.186
PERCENT. PRECISELY IN ORDER TO

00:22:34.252 --> 00:22:35.821
MAKE SURE WE'RE NOT IN SIGHT.

00:22:35.887 --> 00:22:37.756
WE ALSO I THINK NEED TO DO

00:22:37.823 --> 00:22:38.824
SOMETHING THAT I ACTUALLY HAVE.

00:22:38.890 --> 00:22:40.125
MENTIONED I'M GONNA LET HER

00:22:40.192 --> 00:22:42.127

00:22:42.194 --> 00:22:45.564
WHICH IS WE HAVE TO FOCUS. ON

00:22:45.630 --> 00:22:47.799
NOT THE TRADITIONAL AFTERNOON

00:22:47.866 --> 00:22:50.035
PEAK BUT IN THE EVENING WHEN

00:22:50.102 --> 00:22:51.903
THE SUN IS DOWN HOW WE CAN

00:22:51.970 --> 00:22:53.138
MANAGE TO MAINTAIN THE FACT

00:22:53.205 --> 00:22:54.740
THAT DURING A HEAT WAVE. PEOPLE

00:22:54.806 --> 00:22:55.741
DO NOT TURN OFF THE AIR

00:22:55.807 --> 00:22:57.409
CONDITIONING JUST BECAUSE THE

00:22:57.476 --> 00:22:57.976
SUN HAS GONE DOWN IT REMAINS

00:22:58.043 --> 00:23:00.545

WITH THE SAME OBJECTIVES. ARE

00:23:45.090 --> 00:23:46.658
ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT WE ALSO

00:23:46.725 --> 00:23:48.326
NEED TO BE AWARE OFF WITH THE

00:23:48.393 --> 00:23:50.529

BEFORE WE HAVE TECHNOLOGIES TO

00:24:01.940 --> 00:24:03.842
REPLACE THEM WITH ANY OF THE

00:24:03.909 --> 00:24:04.810
SAME TIME WE ARE ALSO

US TO BETTER OPERATE THE

00:24:27.866 --> 00:24:29.734
GREATER VERY IMPORTANT. AND I

00:24:29.801 --> 00:24:31.736
BELIEVE THAT NOT WE HAVE ABOUT

WITH STORAGE WE NEED TO ENHANCE

00:24:55.360 --> 00:24:57.495
FLEXIBILITY WENEED TO PULL

00:24:57.562 --> 00:24:59.698
DEMAND ENERGY RESOURCES AS MUCH

00:24:59.764 --> 00:25:01.266

ELECTRIC VEHICLES TO BE ABLE TO

00:25:09.074 --> 00:25:10.742
PARTICIPATE IN A MARKET THAT

00:25:10.809 --> 00:25:11.810
ALLOWS THEM TO SUPPORT THE

00:25:11.877 --> 00:25:13.778
GRANT. AND MONETIZE THEIR

00:25:13.845 --> 00:25:23.622
INCENTIVES. BECAUSE BLACKS

WE ALSO KNEW TO BE ABLE TO

00:25:26.691 --> 00:25:28.493

INFRASTRUCTURE RIGHT. BECAUSE

00:25:46.278 --> 00:25:47.812
MAKE ONE FINAL POINT OKAY YEAH

00:25:47.879 --> 00:25:48.380
I THINK IT'S A IMPORTANT IT

BACK WHEN WE HAD THE ENERGY

00:25:52.751 --> 00:25:53.251
CRISIS AND WALLY MCGUIRE WAS

00:25:53.318 --> 00:25:56.688
RUNNING. HE REMEMBER HIM HE WAS

00:25:56.755 --> 00:25:58.423

AND DO IT AT NIGHT WHEN THE

00:26:04.596 --> 00:26:06.665
LOAD WAS DOWN NOW BECAUSE WE

00:26:06.731 --> 00:26:08.300
HAVE SOLAR AND SOMETIMES WHEN

00:26:08.366 --> 00:26:10.101
DURING THE DAY WE'RE GETTING A

00:26:10.168 --> 00:26:11.937
GREATER ELEMENT OF POWER THE

DUCK CURVE AND ALL THOSE

00:26:13.104 --> 00:26:15.373

SILICON BASED SOLAR STARTS TO

00:26:35.126 --> 00:26:36.962
DEGRADE AT SEVENTY SEVEN

00:26:37.028 --> 00:26:38.563
DEGREES. ARE THERE SOME

00:26:38.630 --> 00:26:40.298
EXPECTATIONS FROM OUR EXPERTS

00:26:40.365 --> 00:26:41.232
HERE IN THE SENATE WITH WHOM WE

00:26:41.299 --> 00:26:43.201
CONSULTED WITH STAFF BEFORE

00:26:43.268 --> 00:26:45.537
THIS HEARING TO HELP PREPARE

00:26:45.603 --> 00:26:46.838
THAT THEY EXPECT IS WE COULD

00:26:46.905 --> 00:26:48.506
HAVE TEMPERATURES MUCH AS A

00:26:48.573 --> 00:26:49.941
HUNDRED TWENTY DEGREES. SO NOW

00:26:50.008 --> 00:26:51.543

ELECTRONS DURING THE DAY. AND

00:26:57.582 --> 00:26:58.550
THAT COULD BE SHUTTING DOWN

00:26:58.616 --> 00:27:00.785
BECAUSE THE POWER THAT YOU'RE

00:27:00.852 --> 00:27:02.620
SICK YOU'RE RELYING ON WHICH

00:27:02.687 --> 00:27:03.888
HAS BEEN PRETTY EXTRAORDINARY

00:27:03.955 --> 00:27:05.090
AND SOLAR WILL DRAMATICALLY BE

00:27:05.156 --> 00:27:06.992
REDUCED WHICH FURTHER THAN PUTS

00:27:07.058 --> 00:27:08.893
US AT RISK FOR BLACKOUTS AND I

00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:11.296
JUST. YOU KNOW ONLY RAISE THIS

00:27:11.363 --> 00:27:13.198
BECAUSE WE FROM OUR EXPERTS AND

00:27:13.264 --> 00:27:14.432

PREPARED BECAUSE WE CAN'T TAKE

00:27:19.371 --> 00:27:20.271
THIS RISK I DON'T THINK THERE'S

00:27:20.338 --> 00:27:21.506
ANY SHORE MAKE ANY FURTHER

00:27:21.573 --> 00:27:23.008
COMMENTS I JUST WANTED TO MAKE

00:27:23.074 --> 00:27:24.542
THAT CLEAR. WHEN THE HOMEWORK

00:27:24.609 --> 00:27:28.346
THAT WE'VE. DONE HERE WITH OUR

00:27:28.413 --> 00:27:29.447
OWN. OF PEOPLES. YES IT I'M

00:27:29.514 --> 00:27:31.249
ABSOLUTELY. ANYBODY JUST ADD WE

00:27:31.316 --> 00:27:33.551
NEED TO BE. WITH CLIMATE CHANGE

00:27:33.618 --> 00:27:35.754
INCREASING TEMPERATURES AND WE

00:27:35.820 --> 00:27:37.022
MAY SEE VARIATION NOT ONLY IN

00:27:37.088 --> 00:27:39.791
SEOUL. SOLAR MAY REACH. YOUR

00:27:39.858 --> 00:27:42.327
FOUR BY 10% OR- MORE DEPENDING

00:27:42.394 --> 00:27:43.828
ON THE TEMPERATURES AND WE SEE

00:27:43.895 --> 00:27:44.896
ABOUT A HUNDRED AND TWENTY

00:27:44.963 --> 00:27:46.631
DEGREES IN RIYADH IN THE DESERT

00:27:46.698 --> 00:27:48.333
AND OTHER LOCATIONS. WIND

00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:50.402
DOESN'T ALWAYS BLOW I MEAN WE

00:27:50.468 --> 00:27:51.436
WHAT WE COULD HAVE A CLOUD

00:27:51.503 --> 00:27:53.505
COVER. AND ALSO WITH CLIMATE

00:27:53.571 --> 00:27:55.106
CHANGE THEY MAY BE A REDUCTION

00:27:55.173 --> 00:27:57.342
IN HARD RESOURCES WHICH WE

00:27:57.409 --> 00:27:58.309
DEPEND ON FROM THE PACIFIC

00:27:58.376 --> 00:28:00.278
NORTHWEST. SO WE ARE TAKING ALL

00:28:00.345 --> 00:28:02.347
THIS INTO ACCOUNT. AND ENSURING

00:28:02.414 --> 00:28:03.481
THAT WE BOUGHT ALL THE

00:28:03.548 --> 00:28:05.450
PROTECTIONS IN PLACE. AND ALL

00:28:05.517 --> 00:28:07.452
OF THE RESOURCES STOCK IN ORDER

00:28:07.519 --> 00:28:09.687
SO THAT WE CAN ENSURE. THAT

00:28:09.754 --> 00:28:11.556
WE'VE GOT ENOUGH ON THE BREAD.

00:28:11.623 --> 00:28:14.092
TO PROVIDE RELIABLE SERVICE

00:28:14.159 --> 00:28:15.693
THROUGH THOSE DIFFICULT THANKS.

00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:16.895
AND I'M TAKING CLIMATE CHANGE

00:28:16.961 --> 00:28:22.901
INTO ACCOUNT. IT'S GOING TO

00:28:22.967 --> 00:28:23.768

YESTERDAY BUT I FIGURED WHAT I

00:28:36.614 --> 00:28:39.384
HAD TO. ASK WOULD BE SIMPLE TO

00:28:39.451 --> 00:28:41.653
THEM. TO RESPOND TO I DO HAVE

00:28:41.719 --> 00:28:43.655
THE SAME CONCERNS IT- THE

00:28:43.721 --> 00:28:46.057
MAJORITY LEADER HAS. OVER THIS

00:28:46.124 --> 00:28:47.625
ISSUE IN TWO THOUSAND AND

00:28:47.692 --> 00:28:48.593
FOURTEEN I HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF

00:28:48.660 --> 00:28:50.395
TURNING THE I SO WHEN I WAS SO

00:28:50.462 --> 00:28:52.297
IMPRESSED. WITH EVERYTHING AND

00:28:52.363 --> 00:28:54.499
HOW IT OPERATES AND- GOSH ALL

00:28:54.566 --> 00:28:55.433
THE DIGITAL SCREENS AND

00:28:55.500 --> 00:28:56.434
EVERYTHING THAT YOU GUYS HAVE

00:28:56.501 --> 00:28:58.303
THEIR- IT WAS FRANKLY WAY OVER

00:28:58.369 --> 00:29:00.038
MY HEAD BUT I DID UNDERSTAND

00:29:00.105 --> 00:29:01.539
ONE THING THE DUCK CURVE THAT

00:29:01.606 --> 00:29:04.509
WAS- DESCRIBED AS AN IT TALKED

00:29:04.576 --> 00:29:05.343
ABOUT THE RAMP UP PERIOD THAT

00:29:05.410 --> 00:29:06.678
YOU HAVE TO HAVE. AND HOW

00:29:06.744 --> 00:29:09.380
RAMPING UP IN THE EVENING IN

00:29:09.447 --> 00:29:10.014
TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN WHEN THIS

00:29:10.081 --> 00:29:10.582
DISCUSSION WAS TAKING PLACE

00:29:10.648 --> 00:29:13.051
WAS. SEVERELY DIFFICULT TO

00:29:13.118 --> 00:29:14.686
ACHIEVE AND STILL MAINTAIN

00:29:14.752 --> 00:29:16.254
POWER AND IT WAS GETTING HARDER

00:29:16.321 --> 00:29:17.122
TO ACHIEVE NOW THAT'S WHAT

00:29:17.188 --> 00:29:18.490
STAFF TOLD ME AT THAT TIME AND

00:29:18.556 --> 00:29:19.824
BASED ON THE RESPONSE THAT YOU

00:29:19.891 --> 00:29:20.725
JUST GAVE THE SENATE MAJORITY

00:29:20.792 --> 00:29:22.894
LEADER. YOU STILL HAVE THE SAME

00:29:22.961 --> 00:29:25.330
CONCERNS. AND IN THE NEXT FEW

00:29:25.396 --> 00:29:26.431
YEARS YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO

00:29:26.498 --> 00:29:27.632
MAJOR POWER PLANTS COMING

00:29:27.699 --> 00:29:29.200
OFFLINE ONE OF THOSE PLANTS

00:29:29.267 --> 00:29:32.170
PRODUCES ABOUT. 10% OF THE

00:29:32.237 --> 00:29:33.972
STATE'S ENERGY AND TWENTY

00:29:34.038 --> 00:29:36.908
PERCENT. OF ONE I'LL USE ENERGY

00:29:36.975 --> 00:29:38.676
THAT PROVIDES POWER TO THE

00:29:38.743 --> 00:29:41.779
STATE TO OUR RESIDENTS- I

00:29:41.846 --> 00:29:43.114
UNDERSTAND FROM YOUR COMMENTS

00:29:43.181 --> 00:29:44.249
AND JUST WANT TO CONFIRM THAT

00:29:44.315 --> 00:29:47.385
IS STILL A CONCERN OF YOURS-

00:29:47.452 --> 00:29:48.786
YOU KNOW RAMPING UP AND HAVING

00:29:48.853 --> 00:29:51.456
AND AFFORDABLE POWER. AT NIGHT

00:29:51.523 --> 00:29:53.024
BUT I ALSO WANT TO KNOW WHAT

00:29:53.091 --> 00:29:54.626
YOUR THOUGHTS ARE. ABOUT

00:29:54.692 --> 00:29:56.427
REPLACING THE ENERGY TO SOON

00:29:56.494 --> 00:29:57.428
GOING TO BE COMING OFF LINE AND

00:29:57.495 --> 00:29:58.429
COULD CREATE MORE OF A

00:29:58.496 --> 00:29:59.864
BLACKOUTS OR BROWNOUTS REALLY

00:29:59.931 --> 00:30:01.633
BROWN- BLACKOUT SITUATION THAT

00:30:01.699 --> 00:30:05.703
WE HAVE CURRENTLY EXPERIENCED.

00:30:05.770 --> 00:30:07.539
LAST FALL- LAST SUMMER. SO I

00:30:07.605 --> 00:30:09.274
THINK. IT'S CERTAINLY A CONCERN

00:30:09.340 --> 00:30:10.008
IN THE SENSE THAT WERE VERY

00:30:10.074 --> 00:30:11.442
MUCH AWARE THAT WE'RE LOSING

00:30:11.509 --> 00:30:13.011
SIGNIFICAN AMOUNTS GENERATION.

00:30:13.077 --> 00:30:15.146
IN THE NEXT FIVE YEARS- AND WE

00:30:15.213 --> 00:30:16.481
NEED TO START PLANNING.

00:30:16.548 --> 00:30:18.983
ABSOLUTELY TODAY. TO MAKE SURE

00:30:19.050 --> 00:30:20.685
THAT WE REPLACE THAT WITH

00:30:20.752 --> 00:30:22.554
RESOURCES THAT WILL BE

00:30:22.620 --> 00:30:24.255
AVAILABLE. WHEN YOU NEED TO.

00:30:24.322 --> 00:30:25.690
AND FIND AGAIN I THINK

00:30:25.757 --> 00:30:27.892
FLEXIBILITY IS THE KEY RELATED

00:30:27.959 --> 00:30:28.826
RESOURCES THAT CAN GO UP AND

00:30:28.893 --> 00:30:31.162
DOWN- WHAT THOSE RESOURCES WILL

00:30:31.229 --> 00:30:31.896
BE IS GOING TO BE A

00:30:31.963 --> 00:30:33.464
CONVERSATION. BETWEEN THE AYE

00:30:33.531 --> 00:30:36.000
SO IN THE CPC. CPC HAVE

00:30:36.067 --> 00:30:37.435
ALTERNATE JURISDICTION OVER

00:30:37.502 --> 00:30:39.537
THESE ISSUES. BUT YES WE'RE

00:30:39.604 --> 00:30:41.739
VERY MUCH AWARE. AND AGAIN I

00:30:41.806 --> 00:30:46.377
STATE MY OWN VIEW ON THIS IS

00:30:46.444 --> 00:30:46.978
THAT EVERYONE UNDERSTANDS. IN

00:30:47.045 --> 00:30:48.146
THE WORLD OF FINANCE THE

00:30:48.213 --> 00:30:50.381
DIVERSE PORTFOLIO IS THE WAY TO

00:30:50.448 --> 00:30:51.883
REDUCE RISK. AND THE SAME IS

00:30:51.950 --> 00:30:53.685
TRUE AN ENERGY. THAT IS I MEAN

00:30:53.751 --> 00:30:54.919
REALLY PUTTING ALL YOUR EGGS IN

00:30:54.986 --> 00:30:56.254
ONE BASKET IS NEVER GONNA BE

00:30:56.321 --> 00:30:57.655
THE SOLUTION WE'RE GONNA NEED.

00:30:57.722 --> 00:30:59.357
EVERYTHING'S SHORT TERM STORAGE

00:30:59.424 --> 00:31:01.526
LONG TERM STORAGE. DIFFERENT

00:31:01.593 --> 00:31:04.062
KINDS OF RESOURCES OFFSHORE

00:31:04.128 --> 00:31:06.197
WIND HYDROELECTRIC NOT HYDROGEN

00:31:06.264 --> 00:31:08.333
CIRCLE OF SOME HYDRO I MEAN

00:31:08.399 --> 00:31:10.068
IT'S JUST THEIR DESK BURDEN YOU

00:31:10.134 --> 00:31:12.036
DON'T REQUIRE TO HAVE TO FOCUS.

00:31:12.103 --> 00:31:15.073
ON THE ENTIRE GAMUT OF THINGS

00:31:15.139 --> 00:31:18.009
WE COULD GET. THANK YOU. I

00:31:18.076 --> 00:31:19.510
WOULD ONLY ADD ONE SMALL ITEM

00:31:19.577 --> 00:31:20.878
THAT IS NOT ONLY THE

00:31:20.945 --> 00:31:22.513
FLEXIBILITY ON THE PEAK AT THE

00:31:22.580 --> 00:31:23.815
END OF THE DAY THAT WE HAVE TO

00:31:23.881 --> 00:31:25.016
MEET THAT WE'RE ABSOLUTELY

00:31:25.083 --> 00:31:26.884
FOCUSED ON IS ASHLAND SHIN AND

00:31:26.951 --> 00:31:29.454
NEED THE VALUABLE RESOURCES IN

00:31:29.520 --> 00:31:30.888
THE FOURTH FOLIOS. AND THE

00:31:30.955 --> 00:31:32.690
TECHNOLOGIES TO ALLOW US TO

00:31:32.757 --> 00:31:34.125
MEET BACKGROUND WHICH STORAGE

00:31:34.192 --> 00:31:35.827
IS SPECIALLY LONG TERM UTILITY

00:31:35.893 --> 00:31:37.762
SCALE STORAGE. BUT ALSO WE NEED

00:31:37.829 --> 00:31:39.364
TO BE COGNIZANT THAT THERE WE

00:31:39.430 --> 00:31:40.898
OPERATIONAL INDEPENDENT RIGHT

00:31:40.965 --> 00:31:42.133
NOW AND YOU NEED TO BE

00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:43.101
COGNIZANT OF THE FACT THAT A

00:31:43.167 --> 00:31:46.404
FEW. LOCAL OUT MOSTLY DAYS-

00:31:46.471 --> 00:31:47.672
THAT DO NOT ALLOW US TO HAVE

00:31:47.739 --> 00:31:49.107
ENOUGH ENERGY TO CHARGE TH

00:31:49.173 --> 00:31:50.508
BATTERIES MAKE CALLS ADDITIONAL

00:31:50.575 --> 00:31:53.344
PROBLEMS. QUICKLY INVESTING IN

00:31:53.411 --> 00:31:55.179
TECHNOLOGY SUCH AS OFFSHORE

00:31:55.246 --> 00:31:57.515
WIND WHICH ACTUALLY COMPLEMENTS

00:31:57.582 --> 00:31:59.050
THE EVENING PEAK QUITE NICELY

00:31:59.117 --> 00:32:01.352
WOULD BE BENEFICIAL FOR US. AND

00:32:01.419 --> 00:32:03.855
ALSO MORE STORAGE TECHNOLOGIES

00:32:03.921 --> 00:32:06.090
TO ALLOW US TO OPERATE FOR A

00:32:06.157 --> 00:32:08.259
FEW DAYS. AFTER DANCE AROUND

00:34:05.276 --> 00:34:07.378
MORE BENEFITS TO CALIFORNIA AND

00:34:07.445 --> 00:34:08.613
NOT ONLY ARE WE OPERATING THE

00:34:08.679 --> 00:34:10.348
ENERGY IMBALANCE MARKET WE'RE

00:34:10.415 --> 00:34:11.682
DON'T HAVE ALSO BECOME THE

00:34:11.749 --> 00:34:14.085
RELIABILITY COORDINATOR FOR THE

00:34:14.152 --> 00:34:16.020
LAST WHITE RIGHT- WE ARE VERY

00:34:16.087 --> 00:34:17.522
PROUD OF HAVING TAKEN. DOT

00:34:17.588 --> 00:34:19.924
INITIATIVE AS WELL AND THAT

00:34:19.991 --> 00:34:21.659
WILL BRING ADDITIONAL POTENTIAL

00:34:21.726 --> 00:34:23.261
BENEFITS TO CALIFORNIA SO WE'RE

00:34:23.327 --> 00:34:26.998
COGNIZANT THAT OUR PEOPLE PAY A

00:34:27.064 --> 00:34:29.233
BILL WITH STANDS THAT OUR

00:34:29.300 --> 00:34:31.469
SERVICES ARE PART OF THE REACH

00:34:31.536 --> 00:34:33.638
THAT THEY PAY AND TO THE EXTENT

00:34:33.704 --> 00:34:35.072
THAT WE CAN WATCH THOSE AND

00:34:35.139 --> 00:34:45.383
KEEP THEM LOW. WE DO EVERYTHING.

00:34:45.450 --> 00:34:47.652
WHATEVER THINKS THAT IS THAT.

00:34:47.718 --> 00:34:49.120
WE HAVE. DO WE HAVE THE I. DOES

00:34:49.187 --> 00:34:49.954
NOT CAN THE MIX OF RESEARCH OF

00:34:50.021 --> 00:34:51.589
THE IN CAL. BUT WE DO OPERATE

00:34:51.656 --> 00:34:53.758
MARKET I MEAN THAT'S THE BOOK

00:34:53.825 --> 00:34:54.859
UP OTHER THE RELIABLE WHICH IS

00:34:54.926 --> 00:34:55.993
FIRST FOREMOST WE UP A MARKER

00:34:56.060 --> 00:34:58.196
WHICH IS THE WE TO REESE BASED

00:34:58.262 --> 00:34:59.931
ON LEAST COST POSSIBLE AND THAT

00:34:59.997 --> 00:35:02.633
ALSO DEBT THAT'S IMPORTANT

00:35:02.700 --> 00:35:04.268
CONTRIBUTOR TO KEEPING BILLS

00:35:04.335 --> 00:35:07.138
DOWN-AND IT AND IT'S JUST THAT

00:35:07.205 --> 00:35:09.140
THAT'S- THAT IS THAT IS ONE OF

00:35:09.207 --> 00:35:11.442
OUR CORE FUNCTIONS. KAMALA

00:35:11.509 --> 00:35:11.876
AGAIN SECOND ONLY TO

00:35:11.943 --> 00:35:15.413
RELIABILITY. THANK YOU BOTH FOR

00:35:15.480 --> 00:35:15.913
ALLOWING ME TO ASK THOSE

00:35:15.980 --> 00:35:19.083
QUESTIONS. THERE'S THANK YOU

00:35:19.150 --> 00:35:21.619

THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND- HE I

00:35:25.356 --> 00:35:26.791
REALLY APPRECIATED THE

OPPORTUNITY TO MEET WITH BOTH

00:35:28.893 --> 00:35:30.394
CANDIDATES HERE AND THE

00:35:30.461 --> 00:35:31.629
INTERESTING THING ABOUT IT WAS

00:35:31.696 --> 00:35:32.663
IS IT'S RARE WHEN YOU HAVE

00:35:32.730 --> 00:35:34.232
THESE MEETINGS THAT YOU WISH

00:35:34.298 --> 00:35:36.234
YOU COULD KEEP GOING AND THAT

00:35:36.300 --> 00:35:37.768
IS CLEARLY WHAT WAS HAPPENING

00:35:37.835 --> 00:35:39.971
WITH IT AND I AND MANY OF THE

00:35:40.037 --> 00:35:43.407
THINGS- YOU. YOU SATISFACTORILY

00:35:43.474 --> 00:35:44.709
ANSWERED MY QUESTIONS BUT I

00:35:44.775 --> 00:35:45.776
THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO GET

00:35:45.843 --> 00:35:46.944
SOME OF IT ON THE RECORD THAT

00:35:47.011 --> 00:35:48.179
HAVE THESE DISCUSSIONS OUT IN

00:35:48.246 --> 00:35:50.448
THE OPEN AND I'D LIKE TO PICK

00:35:50.515 --> 00:35:51.048
UP ON A COUPLE OF THINGS FROM

00:35:51.115 --> 00:35:56.454
EACH OF THE ARE THE PREVIOUS.

00:35:56.521 --> 00:35:58.489
AND ONE IS YOU MENTIONED

00:35:58.556 --> 00:36:00.024
BATTERY STORAGE OR YOU

00:36:00.091 --> 00:36:03.461
MENTIONED STORAGE BUT OUR OUR

00:36:03.528 --> 00:36:05.963
AND IT'S GREAT BECAUSE IT IN MY

00:36:06.030 --> 00:36:08.232
DISTRICT OF FOSSIL FUEL PLANT

00:36:08.299 --> 00:36:09.200
IN MOSS LANDING HAS BEEN

00:36:09.267 --> 00:36:11.135
CONVERTED TO TWO BIG BATTERY

00:36:11.202 --> 00:36:13.604
STORAGE ENOUGH PROPOSED FOR THE

00:36:13.671 --> 00:36:16.173
FORMER PLANT AND MORAL BAY AND-

00:36:16.240 --> 00:36:19.710
OUR OF WHAT DO YOU THINK. ARE

00:36:19.777 --> 00:36:22.647
ARE. ARE THE GAINS THAT WERE

00:36:22.713 --> 00:36:24.482
ABOUT TO MAKE IN BATTERY

00:36:24.549 --> 00:36:25.783
STORAGE BUT WHERE DOES THAT

00:36:25.850 --> 00:36:27.718
JUST LEAVE US WHY DOES THAT.

00:36:27.785 --> 00:36:30.488
MATTER THAT SLIM COMFORT GIVEN

00:36:30.555 --> 00:36:32.223
THE OVERALL LOOK AT THE PICTURE

00:36:32.290 --> 00:36:38.029
YOU'RE DESCRIBING. WHAT I'M

00:36:38.095 --> 00:36:39.397
SORRY I'M NOT I'M NOT DOING A

00:36:39.463 --> 00:36:40.831
VERY GOOD JOB OF FACILITATION

00:36:40.898 --> 00:36:42.066
I'M JUST TOO WRAPPED UP IN THE

00:36:42.133 --> 00:36:44.402
CONVERSATIO SO- GO RIGHT AHEAD

00:36:44.468 --> 00:36:46.404
AND- EITHER CAN JUMP IN AT

00:36:46.470 --> 00:36:48.072
EITHER POINT UNLESS THE MEMBER

00:36:48.139 --> 00:36:50.174
I'D DIRECTS A QUESTION TO ONE

00:36:50.241 --> 00:36:51.943
OF YOU SPECIFICALLY SO I'LL

00:36:52.009 --> 00:36:54.378
JUST SORRY FOR THAT- BUT GO

00:36:54.445 --> 00:36:57.982
RIGHT AHEAD

00:36:58.049 --> 00:36:59.617
TO POINT OUT VERY QUICKLY THAT

00:36:59.684 --> 00:37:01.552
IT MAY BE SLIM COMFORT.

00:37:01.619 --> 00:37:02.386
ALTHOUGH IT WILL BE A

00:37:02.453 --> 00:37:04.522
TREMENDOUS HELP AND HAVING THAT

00:37:04.589 --> 00:37:05.890
ALMOST TWO THOUSAND MEGAWATTS

00:37:05.957 --> 00:37:07.525
OF BATTERY STORAGE WHICH IS

00:37:07.592 --> 00:37:09.260
VERY FLEXIBLE AND CAN RAMP UP

00:37:09.327 --> 00:37:11.362
QUICKLY. AND PROVIDES A PLACE

00:37:11.429 --> 00:37:13.164
FOR HOURS OF POWER WHICH IS

00:37:13.230 --> 00:37:15.199
WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT AND THIS.

00:37:15.266 --> 00:37:17.268
IS A GREAT RESOURCE IN TERMS OF

00:37:17.335 --> 00:37:19.103
BEING ABLE FOR US TO DO A LOT

00:37:19.170 --> 00:37:21.372
OF SHIFTING. WE'RE ALSO SEEING

00:37:21.439 --> 00:37:24.075
BACKGROUND LAST BEFORE HOURS-

00:37:24.141 --> 00:37:24.775
THREE TO FOUR HOURS EVERY

00:37:24.842 --> 00:37:26.344
EVENING EVERY DAY WHICH IS

00:37:26.410 --> 00:37:28.212
CURRENTLY AT FIFTEEN THOUSAND

00:37:28.279 --> 00:37:30.715
MEGAWATTS. BY TWENTY THIRTY AS

00:37:30.781 --> 00:37:32.016
WE TRANSITION TO MORE

00:37:32.083 --> 00:37:33.985
RENEWABLES ON THE GRID. THAT

00:37:34.051 --> 00:37:37.121
RAMP IS EXPECTED TO BE ABOUT

00:37:37.188 --> 00:37:38.489
TWENTY THOUSAND MEGAWATTS SO WE

00:37:38.556 --> 00:37:40.291
NEED MORE STORAGE WE NEED MORE

00:37:40.358 --> 00:37:41.659
FLEXIBILITY WE NEED MORE

00:37:41.726 --> 00:37:43.594
GENERATION THE CAN RAMP UP

00:37:43.661 --> 00:37:45.496
QUICKLY. AND WE EVEN PEAK

00:37:45.563 --> 00:37:47.531
DEMAND AND ALLOW US TO RUN

00:37:47.598 --> 00:37:49.200
THROUGH THOSE FOUR HOURS. AND

00:37:49.266 --> 00:37:50.735
AS WE DO CARBONIZED NEED TO BE

00:37:50.801 --> 00:37:52.370
LOOKING AT MORE AND A VARIETY

00:37:52.436 --> 00:37:53.904
OF RESOURCES YOU. SHOULD BE

00:37:53.971 --> 00:37:55.973
ABLE TO ACHIEVE THAT. WELL AND

00:37:56.040 --> 00:37:57.775
JUST TO FOLLOW UP QUICKLY. I

00:37:57.842 --> 00:37:59.410
MEAN I'M OBVIOUSLY A LAY PERSON

00:37:59.477 --> 00:38:01.278
BUT I KNOW THAT NIGHT IS LONGER

00:38:01.345 --> 00:38:03.547
THAN THREE OR FOUR HOURS. SO

00:38:03.614 --> 00:38:05.316
HOW HOW DOES THAT HANDLE IT

00:38:05.383 --> 00:38:07.118
WHEN WE DON'T HAVE SOLAR FOR

00:38:07.184 --> 00:38:09.720
THAT PERIOD OF TIME. WE HAVE.

00:38:09.787 --> 00:38:13.791
YES KNOW. IT DOES- I THINK THIS

00:38:13.858 --> 00:38:14.725
IS WHAT I MEANT ABOUT

00:38:14.792 --> 00:38:22.833
DIVERSITY. IS THAT- BATTERY

00:38:22.900 --> 00:38:24.769
STORE FOR BATTERY STORAGE.

00:38:24.835 --> 00:38:25.302
HELPS WITH ONE IS. BUT IT

00:38:25.369 --> 00:38:26.470
DOESN'T SOLVE THE- A- HOW DO WE-

00:38:26.537 --> 00:38:27.371
THE LIGHTS ON AT NIGHT AND

00:38:27.438 --> 00:38:29.140
THAT'S WHERE DIVERSITY TO FIRST

00:38:29.206 --> 00:38:30.908
PORTFOLIO IS SO IMPORTANT. IS

00:38:30.975 --> 00:38:32.643
FOR NOW WE ARE STILL. WILL HAVE

00:38:32.710 --> 00:38:34.145
HIGH DRUG WE HAVE HYDRO WILL

00:38:34.211 --> 00:38:35.780
HAVE A HYDRO. AND WATER

00:38:35.846 --> 00:38:37.248
OBVIOUSLY RUNS THE NIGHT OR

00:38:37.314 --> 00:38:39.684
DAY- AND WE'LL HAVE SOME WIND

00:38:39.750 --> 00:38:41.218
BECAUSE THE WIND ALSO DOES NOT

00:38:41.285 --> 00:38:43.087
ENTIRELY DEPENDENT ON THE SUN.

00:38:43.154 --> 00:38:44.121
BUT WE WILL HAVE TO LOOK AT

00:38:44.188 --> 00:38:47.825
OTHER RESOURCE- AND THERE'S NO

00:38:47.892 --> 00:38:49.060
QUESTION ABOUT THAT. THIS

00:38:49.126 --> 00:38:50.394
INCLUDING ONE OF THE THINGS WE

00:38:50.461 --> 00:38:51.595
NEED TO LOOK AT SERIOUSLY

00:38:51.662 --> 00:38:53.831
CONSIDER IS MORE LONG TERM

00:38:53.898 --> 00:38:56.167
UTILITY SCALE STORAGE- BECAUSE

00:38:56.233 --> 00:38:58.235
THAT IS. SOMETHING THAT REALLY

00:38:58.302 --> 00:38:59.537
ESPECIALLY IF COUPLED WITH

00:38:59.603 --> 00:39:01.472
OTHERS WITH CLEAN POWER TO

00:39:01.539 --> 00:39:03.607
CHARGE. IS ANOTHER RESOURCE

00:39:03.674 --> 00:39:06.310
THAT WE CAN USE BUT IT'S NOT

00:39:06.377 --> 00:39:07.044
IT'S NO SINGLE THING THAT'S ALL

00:39:07.111 --> 00:39:09.246
OF THE ABOVE- FOR EXAMPLE

00:39:09.313 --> 00:39:12.216
BATTERIES ALSO CANNOT SOLVE THE

00:39:12.283 --> 00:39:12.850
PROBLEM OF WHAT HAPPENS IF IT'S

00:39:12.917 --> 00:39:14.485
CLOUDY FOR FIVE. I'M THAT'S NOT

00:39:14.552 --> 00:39:15.352
YET WHAT HAPPENS EVEN IN

00:39:15.419 --> 00:39:16.554
CALIFORNIA YOU HAVE CLOUDY

00:39:16.620 --> 00:39:19.190
WEATHER. AND OBVIOUSLY A FOUR

00:39:19.256 --> 00:39:21.058
HOUR BATTERY IS NOT A REALLY IS

00:39:21.125 --> 00:39:23.427
NOT THE SOLUTION TO THAT

00:39:23.494 --> 00:39:25.362
PARTICULAR CHALLENGE. AND THEN

00:39:25.429 --> 00:39:26.731
LET ME FOLLOW UP ON A QUESTION

00:39:26.797 --> 00:39:29.533
THAT SENATOR GROVE PASSED IT

00:39:29.600 --> 00:39:31.469
AND THAT'S THAT HE TALKED ABOUT

00:39:31.535 --> 00:39:33.237
THE POWER PLANTS GOING OFFLINE

00:39:33.304 --> 00:39:34.438
AND ONE OF THE BIG ONES IN MY

00:39:34.505 --> 00:39:36.474
DISTRICT ABLOH CANYON AND WHEN

00:39:36.540 --> 00:39:38.776
I TOURED THAT PLANT. ONE OF THE

00:39:38.843 --> 00:39:40.377
FASCINATING THINGS I LEARNED AS

00:39:40.444 --> 00:39:42.980
ONCE IT RAMPS UP IT RAMPS UP AT

00:39:43.047 --> 00:39:44.849
THAT LEVEL FOR SEVEN DAYS THEY

00:39:44.915 --> 00:39:46.650
THEY THEY CAN'T CHANGE IT AND

00:39:46.717 --> 00:39:47.818
THERE WERE TIMES THAT

00:39:47.885 --> 00:39:49.420
RENEWABLES WERE BEING REJECTED

00:39:49.487 --> 00:39:51.722
ON THE GRID. BECAUSE YOU JUST

00:39:51.789 --> 00:39:53.023
HAD THIS POWER COMING AT A NON

00:39:53.090 --> 00:39:54.892
REGULATED LEVEL OUT OF TO HAVE

00:39:54.959 --> 00:39:56.861
LOW CANYON. AND YOU'RE EXACTLY

00:39:56.927 --> 00:39:58.662
THE AND I MEANT TO ASK YOU THIS

00:39:58.729 --> 00:40:00.998
THE OTHER DAY YOUR THE ONES

00:40:01.065 --> 00:40:02.433
THAT. WHERE THE RUBBER MEETS

00:40:02.500 --> 00:40:04.268
THE ROAD ON REGULATING THE

00:40:04.335 --> 00:40:07.705
POWER HOW DO YOU DEAL WITH THAT

00:40:07.772 --> 00:40:09.573
WHEN THAT HAPPENS. WELL FOR NOW

00:40:09.640 --> 00:40:13.310
DO. CANYON YES YES TWENTY FOUR

00:40:13.377 --> 00:40:14.378
SEVEN AND IT'S BASED LOW POWER

00:40:14.445 --> 00:40:15.846
BUT WE DON'T NEED AS MUCH

00:40:15.913 --> 00:40:17.348
BASEBALL'S POWER IT'S SYSTEM

00:40:17.414 --> 00:40:19.416
POWER WE DON'T NEED IT IS NOT A

00:40:19.483 --> 00:40:20.451
CONSTRAINED EVERY YEAR FOR

00:40:20.518 --> 00:40:21.986
LIABILITY THAT'S WHY IT'S NOT

00:40:22.052 --> 00:40:23.921
AS CRITICAL. BUT ALSO IT'S NOT

00:40:23.988 --> 00:40:25.456
FLEXIBLE AS YOU SAID IT IS A

00:40:25.523 --> 00:40:27.458
VERY INFLEXIBLE RESOURCE THAT

00:40:27.525 --> 00:40:28.959
WHEN YOU RAMP IT UP WE WRAP IT

00:40:29.026 --> 00:40:30.928
DOWN IT STAYS THERE FOR DAYS.

00:40:30.995 --> 00:40:32.496
AND WE NEED THAT FLEXIBILITY TO

00:40:32.563 --> 00:40:34.198
BE ABLE TO RENT AND REGGIE UP

00:40:34.265 --> 00:40:35.800
AND DOWN. THE FOUR HOURS ARE

00:40:35.866 --> 00:40:37.368
IMPORTANT AT THE END OF THE DAY

00:40:37.434 --> 00:40:38.702
BECAUSE THAT'S HOW LONG THE

00:40:38.769 --> 00:40:41.372
PEAK LAST AFTER NINE PM- HOW

00:40:41.438 --> 00:40:43.307
YOU STARTS TO GRADUALLY GO DOWN

00:40:43.374 --> 00:40:45.176
AND IT'S PRETTY LEVEL TOWARDS

00:40:45.242 --> 00:40:46.877
THAT THE WHOLE EVENING HOURS.

00:40:46.944 --> 00:40:49.580
SO PROVIDING BASELOAD ENERGY.

00:40:49.647 --> 00:40:50.748
TO THE EXTENT THAT IT CAN BE

00:40:50.815 --> 00:40:52.616
CARBON FREE IS OF COURSE

00:40:52.683 --> 00:40:54.585
SOMETHING THAT WE NEED. TO BE

00:40:54.652 --> 00:40:56.620
FLEXIBLE BECAUSE WHEN THREE NEW

00:40:56.687 --> 00:40:57.721
BOWLS WE KNOW THAT WE CAN

00:40:57.788 --> 00:40:59.990
OPERATE A RELIABLE BRENT. IN

00:41:00.057 --> 00:41:02.059
FACT IN CALIFORNIA RECEIVE

00:41:02.126 --> 00:41:04.495
HOURS OF OPERATION IN CERTAIN

00:41:04.562 --> 00:41:06.330
DAYS OVER 90% OF OUR COUNTRY

00:41:06.397 --> 00:41:08.499
AND REGENERATE NOBLES. AND WE

00:41:08.566 --> 00:41:09.266
KNOW THAT WE CAN MAINTAIN

00:41:09.333 --> 00:41:10.668
RELIABILITY DIS IDEAL

00:41:10.734 --> 00:41:12.536
CONDITIONS. THE NAME OF THE

00:41:12.603 --> 00:41:14.104
GAME THOUGH YES MAINTAINED THAT

00:41:14.171 --> 00:41:16.006
RELIABILITY WITH LOW CARBON

00:41:16.073 --> 00:41:18.509
TECHNOLOGIES. EVERY SINGLE DAY

00:41:18.576 --> 00:41:20.444
EVERY SINGLE HOUR AND SPECIALLY

00:41:20.511 --> 00:41:30.387
TOWARDS. EVENING PEAK SO. I'M

00:41:30.454 --> 00:41:31.589
DIVERSE CITY WORKERS LIABLE. IN

00:41:31.655 --> 00:41:33.357
TURN OF HAVING TECHNOLOGIES AND-

00:41:33.424 --> 00:41:34.225
TECHNOLOGY YOUR PARTICULARS

00:41:34.291 --> 00:41:36.360
POINT OUT THANK LEAD US LONG.

00:41:36.427 --> 00:41:37.361
THREE OR FOUR DAYS. ALMOST ALL

00:41:37.428 --> 00:41:39.230
LEARNED SO- AND OPERATE THE

00:41:39.296 --> 00:41:40.531
GRAY. IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR US

00:41:40.598 --> 00:41:42.666
IN CERTAINLY FOLKS ON IT. AND

00:41:42.733 --> 00:41:45.803
IF YOU. IF YOU HAVE OFFSHORE

00:41:45.870 --> 00:41:47.471
WIND A RADICALLY IN THE SAME

00:41:47.538 --> 00:41:50.307
REGION- AND YOU WERE TALKING

00:41:50.374 --> 00:41:51.308
ABOUT HOW THAT CAN BALANCE

00:41:51.375 --> 00:41:52.943
THINGS OUT. HOW DOES THAT ET

00:41:53.010 --> 00:41:56.113
INTO THE GRID ASIDE FROM WHAT I

00:41:56.180 --> 00:41:57.915
MEAN DO YOU HAVE TO DO ANYTHING

00:41:57.982 --> 00:41:59.550
ABOUT THE ENERGY COMMISSION IN

00:41:59.617 --> 00:42:01.752
THE CITING. A HOW DO YOU DECIDE

00:42:01.819 --> 00:42:03.254
HOW TO ADD THAT INTO THE SYSTEM

00:42:03.320 --> 00:42:08.626
IN THE RIGHT WHY. TO DO IT.

00:42:08.692 --> 00:42:09.593
DON'T YOU JUST I'M SORRY. OKAY

00:42:09.660 --> 00:42:10.361
JOINT TO SEARCH BECAUSE THE

00:42:10.427 --> 00:42:12.129
OTHER COMMISSION AS A INSIDE.

00:42:12.196 --> 00:42:14.632
THE CPC ADAM IN PRETTY. BUT WE-

00:42:14.698 --> 00:42:16.533
DECIDE WHAT TRANSMISSION PRAGUE

00:42:16.600 --> 00:42:17.001
WE HAVE TO APPROVE NEW

00:42:17.067 --> 00:42:19.069
TRANSMISSION PROJECTS. IF IN

00:42:19.136 --> 00:42:20.871
FACT FOR EXAMPLE OFFSHORE WIND

00:42:20.938 --> 00:42:22.606
BURKE A GOAL IN IN A SPOT WHERE

00:42:22.673 --> 00:42:24.508
WE ALREADY HAVE. LOTS OF

00:42:24.575 --> 00:42:26.143
TRANSMISSION MOST OBVIOUSLY A

00:42:26.210 --> 00:42:27.978
JOB YEAH WHAT CANYON WE CAN

00:42:28.045 --> 00:42:29.280
REUSE THAT TRANSMISSION THE

00:42:29.346 --> 00:42:30.748
TRANSMISSION IT USED TO BE USED

00:42:30.814 --> 00:42:32.249
TO BRING THE OUTLETS ENERGY TO

00:42:32.316 --> 00:42:33.384
THE STATE CAN BE USED TO BRING

00:42:33.450 --> 00:42:35.352
WET. THERE ARE OTHER LOCATIONS

00:42:35.419 --> 00:42:36.987
THAT. WE WOULD NEED TO BUILD

00:42:37.054 --> 00:42:38.322
NEW TRANSMISSION FOR ESPECIALLY

00:42:38.389 --> 00:42:39.890
IN THE NORTH MARKET THERE WERE

00:42:39.957 --> 00:42:41.392
THE HUMBOLDT ONE WHICH IS THE

00:42:41.458 --> 00:42:43.460
OTHER OPPORTUNITY YOU'VE GOT TO

00:42:43.527 --> 00:42:45.396
BUILD NEW TRANSMISSION. YES

00:42:45.462 --> 00:42:46.430
BECAUSE THERE WE DO NOT HAVE

00:42:46.497 --> 00:42:48.198
ENOUGH BUILT ALREADY ESTABLISH

00:42:48.265 --> 00:42:50.367
TRANSMISSION AND SO. AND OF

00:42:50.434 --> 00:42:52.336
COURSE THERE ARE YOUR- ISSUES

00:42:52.403 --> 00:42:54.204
GOING INTO OFFSHORE WIND ARE

00:42:54.271 --> 00:42:56.473
BEYOND MY EXPERTISE. THINGS

00:42:56.540 --> 00:42:57.908
LIKE GRAPHICALLY WHAT'S

00:42:57.975 --> 00:43:00.411
POSSIBLE. ISSUES I GATHER THERE

00:43:00.477 --> 00:43:00.911
ISSUES WITH THE FEDERAL

00:43:00.978 --> 00:43:02.846
GOVERNMENT DEMAND SO IT'S A

00:43:02.913 --> 00:43:04.848
MULTI LAYER PROBLEM PARKING

00:43:04.915 --> 00:43:07.084
WHAT IS ABOUT WHAT THE WHAT THE

00:43:07.151 --> 00:43:07.685
EXPENSE WOULD BE A BUILDING

00:43:07.751 --> 00:43:09.687
TRANSMISSION. OR USING AN

00:43:09.753 --> 00:43:10.821
EXISTING TRANSMISSION AT THAT

00:43:10.888 --> 00:43:12.589
POINT I KNOW WILL BE FACING A

00:43:12.656 --> 00:43:14.525
COUPLE LEGISLATIVE EFFORTS THIS

00:43:14.591 --> 00:43:16.627
YEAR ON THE SUN. AND LASTLY LET

00:43:16.694 --> 00:43:18.562
ME ASK THE LAKE QUESTIONED THAT

00:43:18.629 --> 00:43:20.631
WE TALKED ABOUT THAT I THINK.

00:43:20.698 --> 00:43:26.337
SOME. PEOPLE THAT DON'T

00:43:26.403 --> 00:43:26.971
UNDERSTAND THE AYE SO. TELL US

00:43:27.037 --> 00:43:28.105
WHY. WE JUST HAPPENED IN TECH.

00:43:28.172 --> 00:43:30.407
IN RELATION TO HOW THEY ARE NOT

00:43:30.474 --> 00:43:32.009
CONNECTED TO THE GRID WHAT

00:43:32.076 --> 00:43:33.410
WOULD HAPPEN IN THE SAME WAY IN

00:43:33.477 --> 00:43:34.812
CALIFORNIA BECAUSE THE WAY WE

00:43:34.878 --> 00:43:36.480
ARE CONNECTED TO THE WESTERN

00:43:36.547 --> 00:43:40.651
STATES. WELLYES THANK YOU FOR

00:43:40.718 --> 00:43:42.486
THAT QUESTION WE ARE WE AREN'T

00:43:42.553 --> 00:43:44.221
AS AS I POINTED OUT WE DO HAVE

00:43:44.288 --> 00:43:45.990
THE ENERGY IMBALANCE MARKET AND

00:43:46.056 --> 00:43:47.825
WE ARE INTERCONNECTED TO OTHER

00:43:47.891 --> 00:43:49.727
STATES. CALIFORNIA ACTUALLY

00:43:49.793 --> 00:43:51.595
CEMENT IMPORTER OF OURS SO WE

00:43:51.662 --> 00:43:53.297
USED TO IMPORTING EXPECTS

00:43:53.364 --> 00:43:55.632
BOARDING ENERGY AND OPTIMIZING

00:43:55.699 --> 00:43:58.602
THAT EXPORT. TAXES IS ISOLATED

00:43:58.669 --> 00:44:00.471
BUT HAVE ALWAYS BEATEN IRELAND

00:44:00.537 --> 00:44:01.939
IN AN OFF THEIR OWN THEY DO NOT

00:44:02.006 --> 00:44:04.375
ALLOW POWER TO COME IN AND THEY

00:44:04.441 --> 00:44:06.076
ALSO DO NOT EXPORT OUR- THERE

00:44:06.143 --> 00:44:07.411
ARE SMALL AREAS OF TEXAS AND

00:44:07.478 --> 00:44:09.179
THE PANHANDLE AND- ALSO WHERE

00:44:09.246 --> 00:44:10.714
THEY ARE INTERCONNECTED CHIU

00:44:10.781 --> 00:44:12.316
SURROUNDING BRANCH AND THOSE

00:44:12.383 --> 00:44:14.151
AREAS ACTUALLY HAVE POWER

00:44:14.218 --> 00:44:16.086
THROUGHOUT THE CRISIS. BUT I

00:44:16.153 --> 00:44:17.488
THINK MOST IMPORTANTLY WHAT WE

00:44:17.554 --> 00:44:19.723
SAW IN TEXAS WAS A SITUATION

00:44:19.790 --> 00:44:20.891
WHERE ONE THEY DIDN'T HAVE

00:44:20.958 --> 00:44:22.359
ENOUGH RESERVE MARGINS THEY

00:44:22.426 --> 00:44:24.294
AREN'T REQUIRED TO DO THAT SO

00:44:24.361 --> 00:44:25.162
THE RESOURCE ADEQUACY WAS NOT

00:44:25.229 --> 00:44:28.499
THERE. I ALSO DID NOT FOLLOW

00:44:28.565 --> 00:44:30.367
FEEDBACK INSTRUCTIONS WHICH

00:44:30.434 --> 00:44:32.336
WERE WHICH WERE RECOMMENDATIONS

00:44:32.403 --> 00:44:34.438
TO INSULATE THEIR EQUIPMENT SO

00:44:34.505 --> 00:44:36.540
WE SAW A MASSIVE THING. CROSS

00:44:36.607 --> 00:44:38.709
THE BOARD OF I'M JUST REACHING

00:44:38.776 --> 00:44:40.511
FOR THE NATURAL GAS INSTRUMENTS

00:44:40.577 --> 00:44:42.312
FREEZING FOR THE NUCLEAR

00:44:42.379 --> 00:44:43.914
TECHNOLOGIES I DON'T KNOW IF

00:44:43.981 --> 00:44:45.482
ALL ELSE FREEZING SO THEY

00:44:45.549 --> 00:44:46.817
COULDN'T ACTUALLY USE THE CALL

00:44:46.884 --> 00:44:48.819
AS EFFICIENTLY AS WELL. WE ALL

00:44:48.886 --> 00:44:51.355
HEARD A LOT ABOUT THE WINDMILLS

00:44:51.422 --> 00:44:52.823
THE WINDOWS IS ACTUALLY A MYTH

00:44:52.890 --> 00:44:55.259
WINDOWS- OPERATE RELIABLY AND

00:44:55.325 --> 00:44:56.493
VERY COLD TEMPERATURES THEY

00:44:56.560 --> 00:44:58.395
OPERATED ARCTIC IN THE NORTHERN

00:44:58.462 --> 00:45:00.097
ST THEY OPERATE IN ARE YOU

00:45:00.164 --> 00:45:01.899
WELL. IN FACT IN IOWA

00:45:01.965 --> 00:45:04.902
MIDAMERICAN ENERGY RUNS A 100%

00:45:04.968 --> 00:45:06.637
THE WIND POWER AND THEY'RE ABLE

00:45:06.703 --> 00:45:08.405
TO BALANCE THAT RESOURCES

00:45:08.472 --> 00:45:09.873
BECAUSE THEY ARE PART OF THE

00:45:09.940 --> 00:45:11.775
GREAT ARE NEEDED WESTERN MARKET

00:45:11.842 --> 00:45:14.044
THE MY SHOP. SO TAXES ACTUALLY

00:45:14.111 --> 00:45:15.546
HURT THEMSELVES BY NOT

00:45:15.612 --> 00:45:18.282
PARTICIPATING IN AN INTEGRATED-

00:45:18.348 --> 00:45:20.317
CAPABILITY OF BRINGING EMPOWER

00:45:20.384 --> 00:45:21.485
AND ACTUALLY OPTIMIZING THEIR

00:45:21.552 --> 00:45:23.320
OWN EXPORT. BUT MOST

00:45:23.387 --> 00:45:25.389
IMPORTANTLY OF ALLOWING THEIR

00:45:25.456 --> 00:45:27.424
INFRASTRUCTURE TO FAIL AND NOT

00:45:27.491 --> 00:45:29.259
BEEFING UP INSULATING AND

00:45:29.326 --> 00:45:31.128
RATHER RISING RECOMMEND AS

00:45:31.195 --> 00:45:43.140
NECESSARY. TO BE ABLE TO

00:45:43.207 --> 00:45:44.174
OPEATE RELIABLY. THANK YOU ARE

00:45:44.241 --> 00:45:45.209
YOU CAN SEE WHY I HAD CUTTING

00:45:45.275 --> 00:45:46.477
OFF THE CA. WHEN I READING WITH

00:45:46.543 --> 00:45:47.978

TYPICALLY I KNOW THAT WE MOVE A

00:45:53.917 --> 00:45:55.419
LOT FASTER SOMETIMES BUT I

00:45:55.486 --> 00:45:57.187
DON'T THINK THAT'S ALWAYS.

00:45:57.254 --> 00:45:58.455
NECESSARY WE'RE HERE TO DO A

00:45:58.522 --> 00:45:59.957

SEEMINGLY HAVE MORE IN DEPTH

00:46:05.829 --> 00:46:07.064
KNOWLEDGE OF THIS TO BE ABLE TO

00:46:07.131 --> 00:46:08.932
UNDERSTAND FOR MY CONSTITUENTS.

00:46:08.999 --> 00:46:10.367
SO I APPRECIATE THE QUESTIONS

00:46:10.434 --> 00:46:13.170

REPRIEVE HAVE BEEN. BUT BUT ALL

00:46:19.009 --> 00:46:20.310
HAVE NOT BEEN ASKING THAT IS

00:46:20.377 --> 00:46:21.879
THE SAME WAY WHO MADE THAT

00:46:21.945 --> 00:46:24.781
STATEMENT ANYWAY. RIGHT GO

00:46:24.848 --> 00:46:26.216
AHEAD SENATOR BABYFACE THANK

00:46:26.283 --> 00:46:28.452
YOU TO BOTH OF YOU FOR YOUR

00:46:28.519 --> 00:46:30.087
SERVICE FUND WHAT IS A VERY

00:46:30.154 --> 00:46:33.390
VERY COMPLEX FONG. AGENCY AN

00:46:33.457 --> 00:46:35.792
ASSIGNMENT- I THINK FROM THE

00:46:35.859 --> 00:46:37.628
CONVERSATION I JUST HAD ENERGY

00:46:37.694 --> 00:46:39.897
WHEN A ONE BECAUSE- I LIKE THE

00:46:39.963 --> 00:46:40.964
CONSTITUENTS WHO DON'T TOTALLY

00:46:41.031 --> 00:46:42.833
UNDERSTAND I ALSO THE GREED AND

00:46:42.900 --> 00:46:44.334
ALL OF THAT BUT WE'VE DONE A

00:46:44.401 --> 00:46:46.103
LOT OF US STUDY OVER THE LAST

00:46:46.170 --> 00:46:48.105
FEW DAYS HOUSE THIS.

00:46:48.172 --> 00:46:48.906
APPOINTMENT PROCEDURE CAME

00:46:48.972 --> 00:46:51.441
FORWARD. MY CONCERN IS THAT I

00:46:51.508 --> 00:46:55.045
THINK THAT OUR ENERGY- PLANNING

00:46:55.112 --> 00:46:57.181
IS REALLY HAMPERED BY THIS

00:46:57.247 --> 00:47:00.450
RATHER INTRICATE AND EXPANSIVE

00:47:00.517 --> 00:47:02.719
BUREAUCRACY THAT OVERSEES IT

00:47:02.786 --> 00:47:04.555
TRYING TO FIND ACCOUNTABILITY.

00:47:04.621 --> 00:47:06.256
I TRYING TO FIND GOALS

00:47:06.323 --> 00:47:08.058
DELIVERABLES VERY DIFFICULT

00:47:08.125 --> 00:47:09.693
WHEN YOU HAVE EACH AGENCY WAS

00:47:09.760 --> 00:47:13.931
SOMETHING DIFFERENT I SERVED ON

00:47:13.997 --> 00:47:14.531
GOVERNOR SCHWARZENEGGER'S. WE

00:47:14.598 --> 00:47:15.632
COMMITTEE HE WANT TO BLOW UP

00:47:15.699 --> 00:47:17.067
THE BOXES BECAUSE HE FELT THERE

00:47:17.134 --> 00:47:18.635
WAS TOO MUCH STYLING THAT WENT

00:47:18.702 --> 00:47:20.804
ON THROUGHOUT OUR GOVERNMENT

00:47:20.871 --> 00:47:22.172
AND I THINK THE ENERGY

00:47:22.239 --> 00:47:24.174
SITUATION HERE REALLY IS A

00:47:24.241 --> 00:47:26.109
PRIME EXAMPLE OF WHY THINGS.

00:47:26.176 --> 00:47:28.812
KIND OF GO AWRY OF MY CONCERN

00:47:28.879 --> 00:47:30.414
LET ME I HAVE TWO QUESTIONS

00:47:30.480 --> 00:47:32.849
ACTUALLY- THAT DEAL WITH. THE

00:47:32.916 --> 00:47:34.651
OVERSIGHT NUMBER ONE YOU FALL

00:47:34.718 --> 00:47:36.853
ON THE RELIABILITY ISSUE I DO

00:47:36.920 --> 00:47:38.488
BELIEVE THAT WE NEED TO HAVE

00:47:38.555 --> 00:47:40.490
THE LEGISLATURE TO BE DIALED

00:47:40.557 --> 00:47:41.758
MORE INTO THEIR FUND IT WOULD

00:47:41.825 --> 00:47:43.727
SEEM THAT THE CONVERSATIONS

00:47:43.794 --> 00:47:46.163
BETWEEN I ALSO. IN P. YOU SEE

00:47:46.230 --> 00:47:47.798
IS WHERE IT BEGINS AND ENDS IN

00:47:47.864 --> 00:47:50.133
TERMS OF THE RELIABILITY AND

00:47:50.200 --> 00:47:51.668
WHAT IS AVAILABLE WHEN WE HIT

00:47:51.735 --> 00:47:53.136
THOSE PIZZA ESPECIALLY IN THE

00:47:53.203 --> 00:47:55.439
SUMMER. SO I WOULD LIKE TO ASK

00:47:55.505 --> 00:47:57.474
THAT WE GET SOMETHING DIRECTLY

00:47:57.541 --> 00:48:00.377
FROM ISEL IN TERMS OF WHAT ARE

00:48:00.444 --> 00:48:02.145
THE NEEDS IN TERMS OF THE AREAS

00:48:02.212 --> 00:48:03.547
YOU SAID WE NEED MORE STORAGE

00:48:03.614 --> 00:48:05.716
WE MEAN NEED MORE DIVERSITY.

00:48:05.782 --> 00:48:07.251
AND WE NEED MORE COORDINATION

00:48:07.317 --> 00:48:09.152
AND OVERSIGHT AMONGST ALL OF

00:48:09.219 --> 00:48:11.188
THE AGENCIES ARE INVOLVED- YOU

00:48:11.255 --> 00:48:13.123
KNOW ENSURING THAT OUR-

00:48:13.190 --> 00:48:14.725
CONSTITUENTS HAVE THE ENERGY

00:48:14.791 --> 00:48:16.193
THAT THEY NEED TO- THE POWER

00:48:16.260 --> 00:48:18.495
THAT THEY NEED TO- FOR THEIR

00:48:18.562 --> 00:48:19.997
LIVES OUT THERE. ACROSS THE

00:48:20.063 --> 00:48:21.832
SPECTRUM SO THAT'S THE

00:48:21.898 --> 00:48:23.634
DELIVERABLE I'D LIKE TO SEE US

00:48:23.700 --> 00:48:26.003
RECEIVE OF MADAME POOLE TOWN A

00:48:26.069 --> 00:48:27.437
VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE ONE OF

00:48:27.504 --> 00:48:29.072
THE- THINGS THAT CAME OUT YOU

00:48:29.139 --> 00:48:30.907
KNOW SO THERE WAS A REVIEW BY

00:48:30.974 --> 00:48:32.843
THE ISO CEO AND HE SAID HE HAD

00:48:32.909 --> 00:48:34.544
WARNED THE PC FOR YEARS ABOUT

00:48:34.611 --> 00:48:36.480
THE ENACT INADEQUATE. POWER

00:48:36.546 --> 00:48:37.948
SUPPLY PLANNING DURING THE NET

00:48:38.015 --> 00:48:40.250
PEAK IN SUMMER THAT COULD LEAD

00:48:40.317 --> 00:48:42.286
TO POWER OUTAGES YET THAT KIND

00:48:42.352 --> 00:48:43.987
OF ESCAPE TO HOLD OFF UNTIL

00:48:44.054 --> 00:48:45.322
THAT HE HAD TO- THIS LAST

00:48:45.389 --> 00:48:46.823
SUMMER. O I THINK THAT'S

00:48:46.890 --> 00:48:53.330
EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. NUMBER.

00:48:53.397 --> 00:48:54.097
TWO WE ARE TO MOVE TO. THE

00:48:54.164 --> 00:48:55.198
ELECT VEHICLE MANDATE BY

00:48:55.265 --> 00:48:56.099
TWENTY. I JUST USING THE

00:48:56.166 --> 00:48:58.135
FIGURES THAT CAME OUT FROM THE

00:48:58.201 --> 00:48:59.836
ENERGY COMMISSION OF THE STATE

00:48:59.903 --> 00:49:01.438
NEEDS OVER ONE POINT THREE

00:49:01.505 --> 00:49:03.340
MILLIONMORE CHARGERS. AT A

00:49:03.407 --> 00:49:05.142
POTENTIAL COST OF THREE POINT

00:49:05.208 --> 00:49:06.610
EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS. THAT'S

00:49:06.677 --> 00:49:08.245
JUST THE INFRASTRUCTURE DOES

00:49:08.312 --> 00:49:09.946
NOT COVER THE COST TO UPGRADE

00:49:10.013 --> 00:49:11.715
THE GRID. TO HANDLE ALL THOSE

00:49:11.782 --> 00:49:13.917
ELECTRIC VEHICLES. SO I'D LIKE

00:49:13.984 --> 00:49:15.452
TO KNOW IF CAL AYE SO HAS DONE

00:49:15.519 --> 00:49:17.421
ANY SORT OF STUY TO DETERMINE

00:49:17.487 --> 00:49:18.622
WHAT THE GRID INFRASTRUCTURE

00:49:18.689 --> 00:49:20.590
NEEDS ARE GOING TO BE. AND IT

00:49:20.657 --> 00:49:23.093
WHAT IT WILL COST TO MEET ABOUT

00:49:23.160 --> 00:49:23.894
TWENTY THIRTY ELECTRICAL

00:49:23.960 --> 00:49:25.696
ELECTRIC VEHICLE GOAL.

00:49:25.762 --> 00:49:27.130
ESPECIALLY WHEN WE'RE LOOKING

00:49:27.197 --> 00:49:28.398
OUT YOU KNOW BACK TO THE

00:49:28.465 --> 00:49:30.701
RELIABILITY OF THE GRID AND HOW

00:49:30.767 --> 00:49:32.402
WE GET ALL THAT TO ADDITIONAL.

00:49:32.469 --> 00:49:34.838
A POWER- TO RUN THE STATE IS

00:49:34.905 --> 00:49:36.306
CERTAINLY TO BE AVAILABLE AT

00:49:36.373 --> 00:49:38.008
THESE CHARGING STATIONS. TO

00:49:38.075 --> 00:49:40.344
KEEP OUR STATE MOVING. SO I'LL

00:49:40.410 --> 00:49:42.179
TOSS THAT TO YOU AND SEE IF YOU

00:49:42.245 --> 00:49:44.514
CAN SHARE IN IN RIGHT NOW SIGN.

00:49:44.581 --> 00:49:46.350
HOW WE WILL MEET THAT GOAL.

00:49:46.416 --> 00:49:47.651
ESPECIALLY IN TERMS OF THE

00:49:47.718 --> 00:49:49.019
RESOURCES THAT ARE GOING TO BE

00:49:49.086 --> 00:49:49.720
NEEDED BOTH ON THE

00:49:49.786 --> 00:49:51.154
INFRASTRUCTURE. AND THE

00:49:51.221 --> 00:49:53.423
PROVISION OF THE LAW THE POWER

00:49:53.490 --> 00:49:57.060
THAT'S NEEDED. FOR A HUGE STATE

00:49:57.127 --> 00:50:02.366
THAT STILL COMMUTES MAINLY. OF

00:50:02.432 --> 00:50:03.600
I. R. TWO. SO HE SAID HE THANK

00:50:03.667 --> 00:50:05.635
SENATOR- ABOUT WHAT YOU START

00:50:05.702 --> 00:50:08.705
AND- AND THEN WE'LL GO. BACK TO

00:50:08.772 --> 00:50:11.408
MR BACK. THANK YOU SO MUCH

00:50:11.475 --> 00:50:12.676
SENATOR AND YES WE'LL BE HAPPY

00:50:12.743 --> 00:50:14.344
TO PROVIDE A REPORT ON HOW WE

00:50:14.411 --> 00:50:15.846
CAN BETTER COORDINATE TOGETHER

00:50:15.912 --> 00:50:17.581
AND ACROSS THE BOARD AND ALSO

00:50:17.647 --> 00:50:18.582
HIGHLIGHT THE IMPROVEMENTS THAT

00:50:18.648 --> 00:50:20.784
WE HAVE MADE. IN TERMS OF

00:50:20.851 --> 00:50:21.952
UNDERSTANDING WHAT THE ISSUES

00:50:22.018 --> 00:50:24.321
ARE. WORKING FROM THE SAME

00:50:24.388 --> 00:50:25.856
PLAYBOOK AND ADDRESSING THE

00:50:25.922 --> 00:50:27.491
ISSUES IN A CONSISTENT MANNER

00:50:27.557 --> 00:50:29.393
ACROSS THE BOARD AND ACROSS

00:50:29.459 --> 00:50:30.994
AGENCIES AND WORKING IN

00:50:31.061 --> 00:50:33.730
COLLABORATION. WITH RESPECT TO

00:50:33.797 --> 00:50:35.432
THE ELECTRIC VEHICLES WE ALWAYS

00:50:35.499 --> 00:50:36.500
LOOK AT ELECTRIC VEHICLES AND

00:50:36.566 --> 00:50:37.601
ELECTRIFICATION OF THE

00:50:37.667 --> 00:50:39.035
TRANSPORTATION SECTOR IS

00:50:39.102 --> 00:50:41.104
CRITICAL BECAUSE IN ORDER TO

00:50:41.171 --> 00:50:43.206
REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS

00:50:43.273 --> 00:50:44.674
43% OF ALL GREENHOUSE GAS

00:50:44.741 --> 00:50:46.309
EMISSIONS IN CALIFORNIA A

00:50:46.376 --> 00:50:47.377
VEHICLE AND MOBILE SOURCE

00:50:47.444 --> 00:50:49.312
RELATED. WHICH MEANS WE NEED TO

00:50:49.379 --> 00:50:50.714
BE WORKING EVEN MORE CLOSELY

00:50:50.781 --> 00:50:52.149
WITH THE CC BECAUSE THEY'RE IN

00:50:52.215 --> 00:50:53.483
CHARGE OF ELECTRIC VEHICLE

00:50:53.550 --> 00:50:55.252
INFRASTRUCTURE AND THE AIR

00:50:55.318 --> 00:50:57.187
RESOURCES BOARD WHICH IS IN

00:50:57.254 --> 00:51:00.190
CHARGE OF MOBILE RESOURCE. I'M

00:51:00.257 --> 00:51:01.291
THE MANDATE FOR ELECTRIC

00:51:01.358 --> 00:51:03.026
VEHICLES IS VERY EXCITING AND

00:51:03.093 --> 00:51:07.397
IT CAN. BE A HUGE HELP TO. OR

00:51:07.464 --> 00:51:08.598
CAN HURT DEPENDING ON HOW AND

00:51:08.665 --> 00:51:10.767
THOSE VEHICLES STRONG. SO WE

00:51:10.834 --> 00:51:12.569
NEED TO ENSURE THAT AS WE ROLL

00:51:12.636 --> 00:51:14.070
OUT THE LUXURY VEHICLES WE ARE

00:51:14.137 --> 00:51:16.740
COGNIZANT OF THE FACT. THAT IF

00:51:16.807 --> 00:51:18.375
ALL THE ELECTRIC VEHICLE START

00:51:18.442 --> 00:51:19.743
CHARGING AT THE END OF THE DAY

00:51:19.810 --> 00:51:20.944
WHEN WE'VE GOT THAT EVENING

00:51:21.011 --> 00:51:23.346
BROWN- THEY MAY ACTUALLY HURT

00:51:23.413 --> 00:51:25.348
THE GRANT SO THE EXTENT THAT WE

00:51:25.415 --> 00:51:26.683
CAN INSULATE CHARGING

00:51:26.750 --> 00:51:27.651
INFRASTRUCTURE FROM THAT

00:51:27.717 --> 00:51:29.553
HAPPENING. AND STANDS

00:51:29.619 --> 00:51:31.354
SUBSTANTIAL MONETARY STATIONS

00:51:31.421 --> 00:51:33.423
SIGNALS ON MONETARY SIGNALS TO

00:51:33.490 --> 00:51:35.258
CUSTOMERS NOT TO CHARGE DURING

00:51:35.325 --> 00:51:36.760
THOSE PERIODS THAT WOULD BE

00:51:36.827 --> 00:51:38.395
VERY HELPFUL. WE'RE ALSO

00:51:38.462 --> 00:51:39.996
LOOKING AT MEDIUM AND LARGE

00:51:40.063 --> 00:51:42.132
SCALE JUDY VEHICLES. AS WE

00:51:42.199 --> 00:51:43.500
CONTINUE TO DECARBONISE THE

00:51:43.567 --> 00:51:45.469
TRANSPORTATION SECTOR IS

00:51:45.535 --> 00:51:47.103
ACTUALLY BEING ABLE TO HELP THE

00:51:47.170 --> 00:51:48.605
GRANT AND HELP COMMUNITIES WITH

00:51:48.672 --> 00:51:50.740
THE FINDER ACTUAL CHARGING. SO

00:51:50.807 --> 00:51:52.809
DURING PEAK TIME WE WILL BE

00:51:52.876 --> 00:51:54.711
ABLE TO DRAW POWER FROM THE

00:51:54.778 --> 00:51:56.580
BATTERIES IN ORDER TO SUPPORT

00:51:56.646 --> 00:51:58.381
THE GRANT. AND ALL THESE

00:51:58.448 --> 00:51:59.883
VEHICLES DISTRIBUTOR THROUGH

00:51:59.950 --> 00:52:01.885
ALL CALIFORNIA WILL ACTUALLY

00:52:01.952 --> 00:52:04.120
INCREASE HOW THE CAPABILITY TO

00:52:04.187 --> 00:52:06.356
INCREASE BRAND RELIABILITY IF

00:52:06.423 --> 00:52:08.258
THEY'RE ACTUALLY OPERATED RIGHT

00:52:08.325 --> 00:52:10.393
AND IF WE MANAGE TO ENSURE.

00:52:10.460 --> 00:52:13.063
THAT WE DON'T HAVE- DISTURBANCE

00:52:13.129 --> 00:52:14.464
AT THE END OF THE DAY OR WHEN

00:52:14.531 --> 00:52:16.166
WE'VE GOT PEAK OF CONSTRAINT

00:52:16.233 --> 00:52:18.235
GREAT CONDITIONS. AND WE WOULD

00:52:18.301 --> 00:52:19.603
RATHER NOT HAVE THOSE VEHICLES

00:52:19.669 --> 00:52:21.071
CHARGING AT THAT TIME BUT WOULD

00:52:21.137 --> 00:52:23.139
RATHER BE PULLING ENERGY FROM

00:52:23.206 --> 00:52:24.741
THEM. AND BECAUSE VEHICLES ARE

00:52:24.808 --> 00:52:26.877
PRETTY MUCH PAR 480% OF THE

00:52:26.943 --> 00:52:28.178
TIME WE DO HAVE THAT BY

00:52:28.245 --> 00:52:29.412
DIRECTIONAL CHARGING

00:52:29.479 --> 00:52:31.581
CAPABILITY. IT ACTUALLY CAN

00:52:31.648 --> 00:52:33.650
HELP THE GRANT AND HAVING AN

00:52:33.717 --> 00:52:35.485
EXCESS AMOUNT OF ENERGY ON THE

00:52:35.552 --> 00:52:37.287
GROUND WITH RESPECT TO MORE

00:52:37.354 --> 00:52:39.356
SOLAR AND RENEWABLES. BUT WE

00:52:39.422 --> 00:52:40.857
SOMETIMES CARTEL DURING THE

00:52:40.924 --> 00:52:42.425
TIME OF DAY BECAUSE WE DON'T

00:52:42.492 --> 00:52:44.060
HAVE ENOUGH RESOURCES TO ACT TO

00:52:44.127 --> 00:52:46.062
STRENGTHEN. CHARGING THOSE

00:52:46.129 --> 00:52:47.864
VEHICLES AND CHARGING BATTERIES

00:52:47.931 --> 00:52:49.966
EXTREMELY BENEFICIAL WE CAN

00:52:50.033 --> 00:52:52.469
CERTAINLY LOOK AT- DESALINATION

00:52:52.536 --> 00:52:54.538
PROJECT AS WELL AS STRINGS. AND

00:52:54.604 --> 00:52:56.039
MOVING TOWARDS FUEL CELL

00:52:56.106 --> 00:52:58.141
VEHICLES WHICH ALSO ELECTRIC IF

00:52:58.208 --> 00:52:59.776
WE MAKE THE HYDROGEN WITH

00:52:59.843 --> 00:53:02.546
RENEWABLE ENERGY AND BALANCE

00:53:02.612 --> 00:53:12.923
THE EXCESS AMOUNT OF RENEWABLES.

00:53:12.989 --> 00:53:13.657
THAT WAY AS WELL. BUT LAST

00:53:13.723 --> 00:53:14.558
IMPORTANTLY DO NEED TO HAVE.

00:53:14.624 --> 00:53:17.594
YOU PLACE CORD. THE HABITS- AND

00:53:17.661 --> 00:53:19.195
CHARGING INTEREST TO BE CHARGED

00:53:19.262 --> 00:53:20.964
NINETY NINE OR THE MIDDLE THANK

00:53:21.031 --> 00:53:22.165
WELL WE'VE GOT ACCESS. AND IT

00:53:22.232 --> 00:53:24.167
WON'T COST GRANT. SO BACK NICE

00:53:24.234 --> 00:53:25.435
YOU'RE RIGHT. IS GOING TO BE

00:53:25.502 --> 00:53:26.570
CRITICAL AND WHEN HE WORK TO

00:53:26.636 --> 00:53:27.704
MAKE SURE THAT THE- WE ARE NOT

00:53:27.771 --> 00:53:29.739
SURE OR- IN THE FOOT BY ATTRACT.

00:53:29.806 --> 00:53:31.775
THE TRUMP. SECTOR BUT IN FACT

00:53:31.841 --> 00:53:33.443
THEY'RE TAKING. OF THE

00:53:33.510 --> 00:53:36.046
SYMBIOTIC OUR POTENTIAL OF

00:53:36.112 --> 00:53:37.647
ELECTRIC VEHICLES HELPING THE

00:53:37.714 --> 00:53:38.315
GRANT AND HELPING GREAT

00:53:38.381 --> 00:53:42.953
OPERATION ALLOWING. US TO

00:53:43.019 --> 00:53:43.954
INTEGRATE MORE RENEWABLES. IT'S

00:53:44.020 --> 00:53:45.989
WHAT I WANT TO GO I AGREE WITH

00:53:46.056 --> 00:53:47.357
EVERYTHING ACTUALLY SENT-

00:53:47.424 --> 00:53:48.491
APOLOGIZE ADD TO THE IS.

00:53:48.558 --> 00:53:50.093
TECHNOLOGY HAS IGNORE POTENTIAL

00:53:50.160 --> 00:53:52.729
HERE- I'M HARD JOB HI SO IS TO

00:53:52.796 --> 00:53:54.531
BUILD MARKETS. AND BUILD

00:53:54.598 --> 00:53:56.466
OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE PRIVATE

00:53:56.533 --> 00:53:59.002
SECTOR. TO PARTICIPATE AND FROM

00:53:59.069 --> 00:54:00.437
FOR EXAMPLE THE IDEA OF BEING

00:54:00.503 --> 00:54:02.172
ABLE TO OPERATE BATTERIES UP

00:54:02.238 --> 00:54:03.673
AND DOWN BOTH HOME BATTERIES

00:54:03.740 --> 00:54:05.542
AND ELECTRIC VEHICLE BATTERY SO

00:54:05.609 --> 00:54:06.643
THAT THEIR PROVIDING POWER INTO

00:54:06.710 --> 00:54:08.845
THE GRID. DURING OF TIMES WHEN

00:54:08.912 --> 00:54:10.180
WE NEED IT AND THEN CHARGING

00:54:10.246 --> 00:54:12.248
WHEN WE HAVE EXCESS POWER. THIS

00:54:12.315 --> 00:54:13.416
IS SOMETHING THAT IS COMPLETELY

00:54:13.483 --> 00:54:15.885
RETOOL- DISTRIBUTED RESOURCES

00:54:15.952 --> 00:54:16.953
FOR INTEGRATING AMOUNT TO THE

00:54:17.020 --> 00:54:17.854
GREAT HAS BEEN ONE OF THE

00:54:17.921 --> 00:54:19.522
BIGGEST PRIORITIES AT THE AYE

00:54:19.589 --> 00:54:21.825
SO FOR THE LAST SIX YEARS. BUT

00:54:21.891 --> 00:54:22.959
IT'S GOING TO BE SOMETHING THAT

00:54:23.026 --> 00:54:24.494
WE PROVIDE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR

00:54:24.561 --> 00:54:25.562
BUT IT'S THE PRIVATE SECTOR

00:54:25.629 --> 00:54:26.529
THAT'S GOING TO HAVE TO STEP

00:54:26.596 --> 00:54:28.131
IN. AND THEY'RE STARTING TO

00:54:28.198 --> 00:54:29.199
PEOPLE LIKE TESLA ARE STARTING

00:54:29.265 --> 00:54:31.301
TO STEP IN AND ACTUALLY BECAUSE

00:54:31.368 --> 00:54:32.235
FOR THEM IT'S A MONEY MAKING

00:54:32.302 --> 00:54:33.737
OPPORTUNITY IT'S NOT JUST THAT

00:54:33.803 --> 00:54:35.438
OF. THEM I WOULD EXPECT I WOULD

00:54:35.505 --> 00:54:36.706
BUSINESSES I WOULD EXPECT THEM

00:54:36.773 --> 00:54:42.512
TO OPERATE FROM PROFIT. MOTIVE

00:54:42.579 --> 00:54:43.013
OUR TRICK IS TO MAKE IT

00:54:43.079 --> 00:54:43.947
PROFITABLE. I GUESS I SEE THAT.

00:54:44.014 --> 00:54:47.817
pTHAT AN INDIVIDUAL FACES WHEN

00:54:47.884 --> 00:54:49.853
WE'RE IN THE MIDST OF A- HUGE

00:54:49.919 --> 00:54:51.988
HEAT WAVE DO I'D CHARGE MY CAR

00:54:52.055 --> 00:54:53.390
OR DO YOU LIVE. HE LEAVE THEIR

00:54:53.456 --> 00:54:55.859
CONDITIONING ON. BECAUSE I

00:54:55.925 --> 00:54:56.993
CAN'T SURVIVE THROUGH THE NIGHT

00:54:57.060 --> 00:54:58.762
WITHOUT IT SO. THOSE ARE THOSE

00:54:58.828 --> 00:55:01.498
ARE- HUGE ISSUES THAT REQUIRE A

00:55:01.564 --> 00:55:04.334
TREMENDOUS EDUCATION. OF OUR

00:55:04.401 --> 00:55:06.536
FOLKS OUT THERE. WHO THINK IT'S

00:55:06.603 --> 00:55:08.071
GOING TO BE REALLY EASY WITH AN

00:55:08.138 --> 00:55:09.439
ELECTRIC CAR JUST TO PLUG IT

00:55:09.506 --> 00:55:10.573
INTO YOUR GARAGE ABOUT WHEN THE

00:55:10.640 --> 00:55:12.742
ENTIRE POPULATION. WHO THE ****

00:55:12.809 --> 00:55:14.511
ARE COMMUTERS IN THEIR OWN

00:55:14.577 --> 00:55:15.078
AUTOMOBILES ARE TRYING TO DO

00:55:15.145 --> 00:55:17.147
THE SAME THING- WE SURELY NEED

00:55:17.213 --> 00:55:18.415
TO BE IN FRONT OF THAT YEARS

00:55:18.481 --> 00:55:20.083
AND FRIEND OF TWENTY THIRTY.

00:55:20.150 --> 00:55:21.051
AND I HAVEN'T HAD MUCH

00:55:21.117 --> 00:55:22.252
CONVERSATION OR HEARD MUCH

00:55:22.318 --> 00:55:25.188
CONVERSATION ABOUT THAT. SO A

00:55:25.255 --> 00:55:26.389
LOT OF CHALLENGES THAT YOU ALL

00:55:26.456 --> 00:55:27.857
HAVE SERVING ON THE BOARD I

00:55:27.924 --> 00:55:29.693
WILL BE VERY FRANK I TODAY I'M

00:55:29.759 --> 00:55:31.361
NOT PREPARED. PREPARED TO

00:55:31.428 --> 00:55:33.329
SUPPORT ARE YOU I NEED TO HAVE

00:55:33.396 --> 00:55:35.932
MORE. REAL I NEED RELIABILITY

00:55:35.999 --> 00:55:37.100
THAT YOU HAVE GOALS THAT YOU

00:55:37.167 --> 00:55:38.435
HAVE DELIVERABLES THAT ARE

00:55:38.501 --> 00:55:40.003
ALREADY PART OF WHAT IS BEING

00:55:40.070 --> 00:55:42.272
PLANNED AND- TO BE PROVIDED TO

00:55:42.338 --> 00:55:43.573
OUR LEGISLATURE BECAUSE THERE'S

00:55:43.640 --> 00:55:45.508
A LOT OF TALK. ABOUT NEEDING

00:55:45.575 --> 00:55:46.810
TECHNOLOGY THERE'S A LOT OF

00:55:46.876 --> 00:55:48.311
TALK ABOUT. YOU KNOW WHAT'S

00:55:48.378 --> 00:55:50.080
COMING THAT WE DON'T HAVE

00:55:50.146 --> 00:55:52.082
ANYTHING TANGIBLE THAT I'VE

00:55:52.148 --> 00:55:53.883
SEEN. AND I'M NOT SERVING ON

00:55:53.950 --> 00:55:55.318
THE ENERGY COMMISSION-

00:55:55.385 --> 00:55:56.953
COMMITTEE SO THERE MIGHT BE

00:55:57.020 --> 00:55:58.755
SOME. THAT HAVEN'T BEEN ARE.

00:55:58.822 --> 00:56:00.457
DISTRIBUTED TO THE DEGREE I

00:56:00.523 --> 00:56:02.258
THINK IT'S VERY VERY NECESSARY

00:56:02.325 --> 00:56:04.394
AT THIS POINT IN TIME. THAT I

00:56:04.461 --> 00:56:06.062
COMMAND YOU YOU'VE BEEN BOTH

00:56:06.129 --> 00:56:07.897
SERVING OUR EIGHT YEARS EACH

00:56:07.964 --> 00:56:09.933
THAT'S NOT AN EASY ASSIGNMENT.

00:56:09.999 --> 00:56:11.634
THAT WHEN THINGS GO WRONG LIKE

00:56:11.701 --> 00:56:14.170
THEY DID IN TEXAS. ARE YOU WANT

00:56:14.237 --> 00:56:14.637
TO MAKE SURE TAT YOUR

00:56:14.704 --> 00:56:17.107
LEGISLATURE. I HAS BEEN FULLY

00:56:17.173 --> 00:56:18.508
APPRISED OF WHAT'S BEEN GOING

00:56:18.575 --> 00:56:20.343
ON AND YOU HAVE THE BACKING.

00:56:20.410 --> 00:56:21.344
AND THE SUPPORT OF THIS

00:56:21.411 --> 00:56:22.879
LEGISLATURE TO MOVE FORWARD

00:56:22.946 --> 00:56:24.681
WITH INITIATIVES YOU FEEL. ARE

00:56:24.748 --> 00:56:26.983
ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL TO

00:56:27.050 --> 00:56:28.051
ENSURING THAT OUR PUBLIC

00:56:28.118 --> 00:56:29.853
UNDERSTANDS WHAT'S COMING THEIR

00:56:29.919 --> 00:56:32.055
WAY WHAT THEY NEED TO DO AND

00:56:32.122 --> 00:56:34.224
ALSO THE COST. I UNDERSTAND THE

00:56:34.290 --> 00:56:36.126
CHARGING STATIONS WILL BE A

00:56:36.192 --> 00:56:37.761
COST OF THOSE WILL BE ADDED TO

00:56:37.827 --> 00:56:39.362
OUR UTILITY BILLS ON OUR STATE

00:56:39.429 --> 00:56:44.100
WHICH ARE. ALREADY VERY HIGH US

00:56:44.167 --> 00:56:45.535
SENATE YOUR BROUGHT UP. SO A

00:56:45.602 --> 00:56:47.937
LOT WORK. LAYS WITH YOU AND- I

I'M GOING TO KEEP THE CARROT

00:56:50.673 --> 00:56:52.008
OUT THERE IN FRONT OF YOU AND

00:56:52.075 --> 00:56:53.977

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION THAT WE

00:57:02.152 --> 00:57:04.053
CAN PROVIDE WOULD BE HAPPY TO

00:57:04.120 --> 00:57:05.321
MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE ACCESS

00:57:05.388 --> 00:57:06.623
TO THAT. AND THEN YOUR

00:57:06.689 --> 00:57:09.092
QUESTIONS ARE ANSWERED. THANK

00:57:09.159 --> 00:57:11.761
YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

00:57:11.828 --> 00:57:13.963
SENATOR MISTER MAJORITY LEADER

00:57:14.030 --> 00:57:14.831
YOU HAD ANOTHER COMMENTER

00:57:14.898 --> 00:57:16.099
QUESTIONS TO FOLLOW UP WITH

00:57:16.166 --> 00:57:17.600
JUST THAT ONE THING WAS

00:57:17.667 --> 00:57:18.201
INTERESTING TO FOLLOW UP ON

00:57:18.268 --> 00:57:19.769
CENTER BATES. YOU KNOW WITH THE

00:57:19.836 --> 00:57:21.838
WITH THIS CAR CHARGING ISSUE

00:57:21.905 --> 00:57:24.073
YOU CAN LITERALLY PUT ELECTRONS

00:57:24.140 --> 00:57:25.842
INTO THE GRID FROM YOUR HOME

00:57:25.909 --> 00:57:26.910
FROM YOUR FULL BATTERY IN YOUR

00:57:26.976 --> 00:57:29.746
CAR IN THE MID DAY. AND GET

00:57:29.813 --> 00:57:31.548
THREE TIMES AS MUCH MONEY AS

00:57:31.614 --> 00:57:33.183
YOU GET PAID FOR CHART FOR PUT

00:57:33.249 --> 00:57:35.285
PAYING INTO THE GRID. AND THEN

00:57:35.351 --> 00:57:36.953
THE COMPUTER CAN TURN ON AT

00:57:37.020 --> 00:57:39.155
NIGHT WHEN THE COST IS LOW. AND

00:57:39.222 --> 00:57:40.723
THEN RECHARGE YOUR CAR SO YOU

00:57:40.790 --> 00:57:42.659
BASICALLY PROVIDING ELECTRONS

00:57:42.725 --> 00:57:43.827
AT THE PEAK POWER LIKE WE HAVE

00:57:43.893 --> 00:57:45.728
PETERS. AT AT A MUCH HIGHER

00:57:45.795 --> 00:57:46.729
RATE YOU CAN ACTUALLY BE AN

00:57:46.796 --> 00:57:48.398
INCENTIVE TO ACTUALLY OWN AN

00:57:48.464 --> 00:57:50.500
ELECTRIC CAR IT I THINK YOU'RE

00:57:50.567 --> 00:57:51.568
GONNA SEE THINGS LIKE THAT IN

00:57:51.634 --> 00:57:52.802
THE FUTURE AS WE BEGIN TO

00:57:52.869 --> 00:57:54.571
INNOVATE MORE MORE. ASSEMBLY

00:57:54.637 --> 00:57:56.472
CREATIVE INCENTIVE MODELS THAT

00:57:56.539 --> 00:57:58.074
COULD ULTIMATELY WILL

00:57:58.141 --> 00:57:59.142
DRAMATICALLY REDUCE THE COST OF

00:57:59.209 --> 00:58:01.010
YOUR VEHICLE. YOU KNOW I JUST

00:58:01.077 --> 00:58:02.679
WANT TO EAT IT IN THE INTEREST

00:58:02.745 --> 00:58:04.414
OF LOOKING AT THE BIG PICTURE.

00:58:04.480 --> 00:58:05.415
YOU KNOW WHAT'S SO DIFFERENT

00:58:05.481 --> 00:58:06.950
NOW AS WE TRY TO MOVE TO GREEN

00:58:07.016 --> 00:58:10.019
TECHNOLOGY. IF I HAD AN

00:58:10.086 --> 00:58:10.820
AUTOMOBILE AND I NEED TO

00:58:10.887 --> 00:58:13.056
TRAVEL. TWO HUNDRED MILES AND

00:58:13.122 --> 00:58:15.325
MY CAR GOT. HIT TWENTY MILES TO

00:58:15.391 --> 00:58:16.926
THE GALLON I WOULD PUT TEN

00:58:16.993 --> 00:58:18.761
MILES OF TED TEN GALLONS OF

00:58:18.828 --> 00:58:20.296
FUEL IN THE TANK. AND I WOULD

00:58:20.363 --> 00:58:22.599
GO TO OUR MILES. NOW IS THE

00:58:22.665 --> 00:58:24.868
GOVERNMENT WE'RE TRYING TO GO

00:58:24.934 --> 00:58:27.170
TWO HUNDRED MILES. BUT WE DON'T

00:58:27.237 --> 00:58:27.737
KNOW IF THE WIND'S GOING TO

00:58:27.804 --> 00:58:29.372
BLOW WE DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S

00:58:29.439 --> 00:58:31.074
GOING TO BE CLOUD COVER. WE

00:58:31.140 --> 00:58:32.075
DON'T KNOW IF THE EFFICIENCY OF

00:58:32.141 --> 00:58:33.710
OUR TECHNOLOGY'S GOING TO DO A

00:58:33.776 --> 00:58:35.712
DIG THE- DO GREAT BECAUSE OF

00:58:35.778 --> 00:58:38.681
UP. THE HEAT. AND SO THE POINT

00:58:38.748 --> 00:58:39.616
I WAS TRYING TO MAKE IN THE

00:58:39.682 --> 00:58:41.084
BEGINNING IS WE HAVE TO REALLY

00:58:41.150 --> 00:58:42.619
KIND OF BUILD REDUNDANCY IN

00:58:42.685 --> 00:58:43.219
WHAT'S CALLED RESOURCE

00:58:43.286 --> 00:58:45.688
ADEQUACY. WHICH I DON'T WHICH I

00:58:45.755 --> 00:58:47.523
WANT TO TALK ABOUT THIS YEAR

00:58:47.590 --> 00:58:49.225
BUT WE HAVEN'T DONE ENOUGH OF

00:58:49.292 --> 00:58:51.628
THAT TO MAKE SURE THAT IF THESE

00:58:51.694 --> 00:58:54.764
UNFORESEEN EVENTS A CAR. RIGHT

00:58:54.831 --> 00:58:56.132
FROM PROPER PLANNING TO MAKE

00:58:56.199 --> 00:58:57.567
SURE THAT THE PUBLIC ITS STATE

00:58:57.634 --> 00:58:58.468
DOESN'T HAVE BLACKOUTS AND

00:58:58.534 --> 00:59:00.470
BROWNOUTS WE HAVE TO HAVE

00:59:00.536 --> 00:59:01.237
ENOUGH REDUNDANCY IN THE

00:59:01.304 --> 00:59:03.206
SYSTEM. SO THAT WE HAVE THIS

00:59:03.273 --> 00:59:05.308
VOLATILITY THAT DOESN'T DOESN'T

00:59:05.375 --> 00:59:06.676
CAUSE THAT PROBLEM AND THAT IS

00:59:06.743 --> 00:59:11.481
FUNDAMENTALLY. THE ARCHITECTURE

00:59:11.547 --> 00:59:12.782
OF THE PROBLEM FACING IN. ORDER

00:59:12.849 --> 00:59:13.549
FOR OF THE SENATE AGREE YOU MAY

00:59:13.616 --> 00:59:14.784
MEDICAL. ABOUT BATTERY OF THE

00:59:14.851 --> 00:59:15.818
WAS A TWENTY. MEGAWATTS

00:59:15.885 --> 00:59:17.820
WHATEVER YOU TALKED ABOUT.

00:59:17.887 --> 00:59:18.454
FIFTEEN THOUSAND MEGAWATTS WITH

00:59:18.521 --> 00:59:19.889
WHAT'S THE TIMING ON THAT

00:59:19.956 --> 00:59:21.257
ANGELINA WHAT WHEN YOU THINK

00:59:21.324 --> 00:59:23.593
THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IN TERMS

00:59:23.660 --> 00:59:27.130
OF. WHAT WILL BE A FIFTEEN OVER

00:59:27.196 --> 00:59:29.032
TWENTY BUT BUT ONE ONE'S A

00:59:29.098 --> 00:59:29.632
HAPPENING WHAT'S OUR TIMING ON

00:59:29.699 --> 00:59:32.101
THAT. IT'S HAPPENING NOW IN THE

00:59:32.168 --> 00:59:34.504
GREAT EVERY DAY AND WE ARE ABLE

00:59:34.570 --> 00:59:36.205
TO MEET THAT RAMP MOSTLY WHAT

00:59:36.272 --> 00:59:37.607
IMPORTS AND SOME OF OUR GAS

00:59:37.674 --> 00:59:39.776
RESOURCES RAMPING UP- DURING

00:59:39.842 --> 00:59:41.444
THE EVENING PEAK. SO IT'S

00:59:41.511 --> 00:59:43.079
HAPPENING NOW BUT AS WE MOVE

00:59:43.146 --> 00:59:44.781
FORWARD TO WORDS TO CARBON

00:59:44.847 --> 00:59:46.816
ISING IN DEEPER DECARBONIZATION

00:59:46.883 --> 00:59:49.052
AND REPLACING THOSE RESOURCES

00:59:49.118 --> 00:59:50.653
WITH CARBON FREE TECHNOLOGIES.

00:59:50.720 --> 00:59:52.622
DELAY BATTERIES AS WE SAID LONG

00:59:52.689 --> 00:59:55.158
TERM STORAGE OR GEOTHERMAL A

00:59:55.224 --> 00:59:57.126
WIN OUR OTHER TECHNOLOGIES WE

00:59:57.193 --> 00:59:58.127
CAN RAMP UP AND DOWN AND OF

00:59:58.194 --> 00:59:59.896
COURSE. UTILIZING THE ELECTRIC

00:59:59.963 --> 01:00:01.464
VEHICLES AND THE BATTERIES

01:00:01.531 --> 01:00:02.932
BEHIND THE METER AS WELL AS

01:00:02.999 --> 01:00:04.634
EFFICIENCY WE NEED TO BE

01:00:04.701 --> 01:00:05.768
COGNIZANT THAT THAT IS

01:00:05.835 --> 01:00:07.136
SOMETHING THAT HAS TO BE MAD OR

01:00:07.203 --> 01:00:09.305
IT HAS TO BE REDUCED- FOR ALL

01:00:09.372 --> 01:00:10.340
OF US TO OPERATE THE GRID

01:00:10.406 --> 01:00:12.141
RELIABLY. AND WE ARE VERY

01:00:12.208 --> 01:00:13.977
FOCUSED ON ENSURING THAT THAT

01:00:14.043 --> 01:00:15.912
HAPPENS. AND ALSO WITH RESPECT

01:00:15.979 --> 01:00:17.347
TO ELECTRIC VEHICLES JUST TO

01:00:17.413 --> 01:00:18.448
JUST TO POINT OUT THAT THE

01:00:18.514 --> 01:00:19.882
CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE FOR

01:00:19.949 --> 01:00:21.284
ELECTRIC VEHICLES TO IS VERY-

01:00:21.351 --> 01:00:23.586
BUT- WE HAVE CHARGING STATIONS

01:00:23.653 --> 01:00:25.121
IN OUR HOMES RIGHT NOW EVERY

01:00:25.188 --> 01:00:27.056
DAY. WHEN YOUR CAR INTO TO

01:00:27.123 --> 01:00:28.658
TWENTY OUTLET IN YOUR GARAGE

01:00:28.725 --> 01:00:30.093
RIGHT NOW. SO THE CHARGING

01:00:30.159 --> 01:00:31.361
INFRASTRUCTURE WE'RE TALKING

01:00:31.427 --> 01:00:32.662
ABOUT THE ADDITIONAL CHARGING

01:00:32.729 --> 01:00:34.297
INFRASTRUCTURE IS MOSTLY FOR

01:00:34.364 --> 01:00:35.932
MEDIUM AND LARGE SCALE VEHICLES

01:00:35.999 --> 01:00:37.600
AND OF COURSE LONG DISTANCE IF

01:00:37.667 --> 01:00:39.502
PEOPLE WERE TRAVELING. AND IT'S

01:00:39.569 --> 01:00:41.204
THE FAST CHARGERS THAT ZAP THE

01:00:41.270 --> 01:00:42.472
SUSPECT THAT WE NEED TO BE

01:00:42.538 --> 01:00:45.141
FOCUSED ON. BUT THOSE AREN'T

01:00:45.208 --> 01:00:46.442
GOING TO BE AS MANY AS THE

01:00:46.509 --> 01:00:47.610
ELECTRIC VEHICLES THAT WILL

01:00:47.677 --> 01:00:49.245
PROBABLY BE CHARGING IN THE

01:00:49.312 --> 01:00:51.047
HOMES AND GARAGES PEOPLE MOST

01:00:51.114 --> 01:00:52.448
OF THE TIME. WE'RE HOPEFUL THAT

01:00:52.515 --> 01:00:53.883
HAPPENS DURING THE NIGHT TIME

01:00:53.950 --> 01:00:55.218
AS YOU POINTED OUT SENATOR

01:00:55.284 --> 01:00:56.886
HERTZBERG. WHEN YOU CAN

01:00:56.953 --> 01:00:58.287
ACTUALLY PLAY ARBITRAGE WITH

01:00:58.354 --> 01:00:59.856
THE MARKET AND YOU'LL BE

01:00:59.922 --> 01:01:01.524
SUPPLYING ENERGY TO THE GRAND

01:01:01.591 --> 01:01:03.326
IF YOUR CAR IS PARKED IN YOUR

01:01:03.393 --> 01:01:04.827
GARAGE WHICH WORKPLACE YOU'RE

01:01:04.894 --> 01:01:06.896
NOT USING IT. DURING THAT PEAK

01:01:06.963 --> 01:01:08.431
IN THE RAMP AND THEN CHARGING

01:01:08.498 --> 01:01:10.033
IN THE EVENING OR DURING THE

01:01:10.099 --> 01:01:11.100
MIDDLE OF THE DAY WHEN WE HAVE

01:01:11.167 --> 01:01:13.102
EXCESS ENERGY. THANK WE ARE

01:01:13.169 --> 01:01:15.538
HOPEFULLY NOT HAVING TO CURTAIL

01:01:15.605 --> 01:01:26.249
BECAUSE WE'RE CHARGING. YOUR

01:01:26.315 --> 01:01:28.584
CAR. THANKS YEAH I JUST AND

01:01:28.651 --> 01:01:30.053
HAVE TO CLICK TO ADD TO THAT

01:01:30.119 --> 01:01:31.587
ONE THING THAT THE REASON WHY I

01:01:31.654 --> 01:01:32.422
TO RESERVE GOING AND LIKE NOW

01:01:32.488 --> 01:01:34.957
IS INTEREST TO AUGUST OKAY SO

01:01:35.024 --> 01:01:36.192
IN THE CITY WORK TOGETHER

01:01:36.259 --> 01:01:37.860
REALIZE WE NEED TO FIFTY NINE

01:01:37.927 --> 01:01:38.394
TO THOUSAND MEGAWATTS OF

01:01:38.461 --> 01:01:39.662
RESOURCE IN THE GROUND NOW IN

01:01:39.729 --> 01:01:40.396
BATTERIES ARE THE FAST TECHNO

01:01:40.463 --> 01:01:41.898
TO BE TO WE CAN'T BUILD PLANT

01:01:41.964 --> 01:01:43.232
IN SIX MONTHS BUT WE CAN

01:01:43.299 --> 01:01:44.867
ABSOLUTELY DEPLOY BATTERIES SO

01:01:44.934 --> 01:01:46.903
THE CPSC APPROVE NEW BATTERIES

01:01:46.969 --> 01:01:47.637
AND THEY'RE THEY'RE BEING

01:01:47.703 --> 01:01:49.005
INTERCONNECTED TO CRY SO GREAT

01:01:49.072 --> 01:01:50.907
AS WE SPEAK. I JUST WANT TO

01:01:50.973 --> 01:01:52.208
MAKE A POINT ON THE BATTERY

01:01:52.275 --> 01:01:54.110
SHOULD KEEP TALKING ABOUT IT

01:01:54.177 --> 01:01:55.411
YOU KNOW I'M GETTING CONCERNED

01:01:55.478 --> 01:01:56.813
ABOUT THE NATURE THE BATTERIES

01:01:56.879 --> 01:01:57.914
IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT YOU'RE

01:01:57.980 --> 01:01:58.581
DOING YOU'RE DOING A LITTLE BIT

01:01:58.648 --> 01:02:00.316
IS SANK MOST OF STUFF YOU'RE

01:02:00.383 --> 01:02:02.752
DOING IS LITHIUM ION READ THE

01:02:02.819 --> 01:02:03.820
STORIES IN THE SIMPLE THINGS

01:02:03.886 --> 01:02:05.788
FOR THE PUBLIC TO UNDERSTAND

01:02:05.855 --> 01:02:07.056
THOUGH SO MANY COMPUTERS THAT

01:02:07.123 --> 01:02:08.424
WERE BLOWN UP BECAUSE THEY GOT

01:02:08.491 --> 01:02:09.592
TOO HOT THOSE HAD LITHIUM ION

01:02:09.659 --> 01:02:11.694
BATTERIES SO HE NOT ONLY HAS A

01:02:11.761 --> 01:02:13.529
DEGRADATION ISSUE ON THE SOLAR

01:02:13.596 --> 01:02:15.698
SIDE. THERE'S ALSO RISK IN

01:02:15.765 --> 01:02:18.534
TERMS OF THE BATTERY SIDE THE

01:02:18.601 --> 01:02:19.268
IN THERE'S A NUMBER OF OTHER

01:02:19.335 --> 01:02:21.304
TECHNOLOGIES FOR NOT USING

01:02:21.370 --> 01:02:22.738
BECAUSE LITHIUM IONS THE STUFF

01:02:22.805 --> 01:02:25.108
NOW BUT AGAIN LOOKING AT THE

01:02:25.174 --> 01:02:26.542
RISK PROFILE LOOKING AT

01:02:26.609 --> 01:02:28.111
RESOURCE ADEQUACY AND LOOKING

01:02:28.177 --> 01:02:29.946
AT THE NATURE OF THE TOOLS WERE

01:02:30.012 --> 01:02:32.181
USING IN THAT REGARD I JUST

01:02:32.248 --> 01:02:33.449
THINK THAT YOU KNOW YOU NEED TO

01:02:33.516 --> 01:02:35.151
BE SENSITIVE TO THAT BECAUSE I

01:02:35.218 --> 01:02:37.687
IT IS NOT RISK FREE AT ALL

01:02:37.753 --> 01:02:39.522
WE'VE SEEN A LOT OF HEAT. THE

01:02:39.589 --> 01:02:42.225
EXPLOSIONS ON THE BATTERIES A

01:02:42.291 --> 01:02:43.025
SCENE BECAUSE OF THAT SO I JUST

01:02:43.092 --> 01:02:45.128
AGAIN EITHER I DON'T WANT TO

01:02:45.194 --> 01:02:45.728
STRESS IT BUT I JUSTWANT TO

01:02:45.795 --> 01:02:46.896
PUT ON THE RECORD BECAUSE WE

01:02:46.963 --> 01:02:47.997
GET AS WE LOOK AT ALL THESE

01:02:48.064 --> 01:02:49.398
FACTORS WE HAVE VERY VERY

01:02:49.465 --> 01:02:51.634
MINDFUL VERY CONSERVATIVE ABOUT

01:02:51.701 --> 01:02:57.073
HOW. WE TRANSITION INTO THE

01:02:57.140 --> 01:02:58.107
GREEN SPACE. I'M ABSOLUTELY

01:02:58.174 --> 01:03:00.676
COULD. IF I MAY YOU. FOR OUT

01:03:00.743 --> 01:03:02.445
OVER FOCUS ON THE RIGHT. WHAT

01:03:02.512 --> 01:03:04.247
THE PRINTER. RISK BE WITH ALL.

01:03:04.313 --> 01:03:06.349
ACROSS THE BOARD. WITH A BAD.

01:03:06.415 --> 01:03:07.683
SPEED SO AND SOME OF THE

01:03:07.750 --> 01:03:09.252
DECORATIVE. OF THE SOLAR. TIME

01:03:09.318 --> 01:03:11.420
WHICH IS ABOUT 10% INCLUDING IN

01:03:11.487 --> 01:03:13.689
THE HEAT AND AFTER TEN YEARS.

01:03:13.756 --> 01:03:15.391
BUT ALSO WITH REGARDS TO GAS

01:03:15.458 --> 01:03:16.826
POWER PLANTS WHICH WE HAVE

01:03:16.893 --> 01:03:19.295
SEEN- ALSO OPERATE AND THEIR

01:03:19.362 --> 01:03:20.663
EFFICIENCY DECREASED IN REALLY

01:03:20.730 --> 01:03:22.999
HOT WEATHER. THE TUNE OF 20%

01:03:23.065 --> 01:03:24.400
AND HIGHER WHICH HAPPENED THIS

01:03:24.467 --> 01:03:26.169
SUMMER AS WELL. SUNDAY

01:03:26.235 --> 01:03:29.438
GRADATION. AND REDUNDANCIES IS

01:03:29.505 --> 01:03:30.840
ALWAYS SOMETHING THAT WE ARE

01:03:30.907 --> 01:03:32.508
MISTER DOC WILL LOOK BACK AND

01:03:32.575 --> 01:03:33.743
WE NEED TO ENSURE WE HAVE

01:03:33.809 --> 01:03:36.045
ENOUGH RESOURCE. ENOUGH OF A

01:03:36.112 --> 01:03:38.347
VARIETY OF RESOURCES. TO ENSURE

01:03:38.414 --> 01:03:39.715
THAT WE CAN ACCOUNT FOR ALL OF

01:03:39.782 --> 01:03:46.088
THAT HAPPENING ESPECIALLY. THAT

01:03:46.155 --> 01:03:47.723
THAT EVENING. THANK YOU AKAU.

01:03:47.790 --> 01:03:50.092
THE WELL LET ME JUST- COMMENT

01:03:50.159 --> 01:03:51.761
BEFORE WE GO TO PUBLIC COMMENT

01:03:51.827 --> 01:03:53.763
I THINK- THIS BEEN A GREAT

01:03:53.829 --> 01:03:55.431
DISCUSSION I THINK THE

01:03:55.498 --> 01:03:56.766
QUESTIONS IN THE COMMENTS OF MY

01:03:56.832 --> 01:03:59.368
COLLEAGUES. AGAIN I AGREE WITH

01:03:59.435 --> 01:04:00.403
SENATOR BATES IT'S ALWAYS GOOD

01:04:00.469 --> 01:04:02.371
TO GO. LAST OR NEAR LAST

01:04:02.438 --> 01:04:03.839
BECAUSE A LOT OF THE QUESTIONS

01:04:03.906 --> 01:04:06.142
THAT ARE TOP OF THE MIND. I

01:04:06.209 --> 01:04:08.211
HAVE ALREADY BEEN COVERED. SO

01:04:08.277 --> 01:04:09.679
YOU KNOW FOR ME IT YOUR

01:04:09.745 --> 01:04:11.881
EXPERTISE IS CLEARLY VISIBLE

01:04:11.948 --> 01:04:14.483
TODAY- OBVIOUSLY- YOU KNOW THIS

01:04:14.550 --> 01:04:15.985
IS THE KIND OF EXPERTISE WE

01:04:28.664 --> 01:04:30.833
CURRICULAR ACTIVITY. SO I

01:04:30.900 --> 01:04:32.935
THINK- I THINK CALIFORNIA'S

01:04:33.002 --> 01:04:35.004
CLEARLY FORTUNATE TO HAVE THIS

01:04:35.071 --> 01:04:38.474
KIND OF OUR- EXPERTISE IN YOUR

01:04:38.541 --> 01:04:39.075
TALENT SO I WANT TO THANK YOU

01:04:39.141 --> 01:04:42.912
FOR THAT- THE OB I DON'T REALLY

01:04:42.979 --> 01:04:45.047
HAVE A QUESTION- BECAUSE- IN

01:04:45.114 --> 01:04:46.582
SOME RESPECTS I DON'T WANT TO.

01:04:46.649 --> 01:04:49.452
BEAT A DEAD HORSE HARM. OR

01:04:49.518 --> 01:04:53.356
ANYTHING- TO DEATH- BUT I DO

01:04:53.422 --> 01:04:55.758
WANT TO SAY YOU KNOW I AGREE

01:04:55.825 --> 01:04:57.727
THAT MARKETS ARE FINE AND GOOD

01:04:57.793 --> 01:04:59.962
THINGS FOR SOMETHINGS. ARE

01:05:00.029 --> 01:05:01.297
CLEARLY ARE MARKET FORCES ARE

01:05:01.364 --> 01:05:02.999
CRITICALLY IMPORTANT TO THE

01:05:03.065 --> 01:05:05.067
ECONOMY AND HOW THINGS WORK.

01:05:05.134 --> 01:05:06.836
BUT I ALSO THINK WE'RE DEALING

01:05:06.902 --> 01:05:08.104
WITH PUBLIC INTEREST IN THE

01:05:08.170 --> 01:05:09.438
URGENT NEED FOR POWER FOR ALL

01:05:09.505 --> 01:05:11.240
CALIFORNIANS IT'S MORE OF A

01:05:11.307 --> 01:05:14.176
NECESSITY AS OPPOSED TO. ODD TO

01:05:14.243 --> 01:05:15.845
THE OTHER SO I WANT TO POINT

01:05:15.911 --> 01:05:17.880
THAT OUT AND THEN. BACK TO THE

01:05:17.947 --> 01:05:20.349
HORSE. I YOU KNOW GOVERNANCE IS

01:05:20.416 --> 01:05:21.784
IMPORTANT AND EVERY TIME A

01:05:21.851 --> 01:05:23.219
APPOINTEES COME BEFORE US FROM

01:05:23.286 --> 01:05:24.487
CAL AYE SO WE TALK ABOUT THE

01:05:24.553 --> 01:05:26.389
GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE. AND THE

01:05:26.455 --> 01:05:28.424
FACT THAT WE AS LEGISLATORS GET

01:05:28.491 --> 01:05:29.392
HELD ACCOUNTABLE WHEN THINGS GO

01:05:29.458 --> 01:05:32.128
WRONG. AND YET WE DON'T ALWAYS

01:05:32.194 --> 01:05:35.031
YEAH YES. IS A LOOK AT OUR

01:05:35.097 --> 01:05:39.168
FORMER SPEAKER OF THE ASSEMBLY-

01:05:39.235 --> 01:05:42.004
YEAH BACK BACK IN TWO THOUSAND

01:05:42.071 --> 01:05:44.407
NINETY NINE TWO THOUSAND- I

01:05:44.473 --> 01:05:45.841
THINK I WANT TO SAY THAT THIS

01:05:45.908 --> 01:05:48.210
IS THE ONLY DIRECT ABILITY WE

01:05:48.277 --> 01:05:50.346
HAVE. TO HAVE SOME INPUT IN

01:05:50.413 --> 01:05:52.415
THAT HAS THE LARGEST STATE

01:05:52.481 --> 01:05:55.251
FORTY MILLION PEOPLE AND SO- I

01:05:55.318 --> 01:05:56.786
JUST WANT TO UNDERSCORE THAT

01:05:56.852 --> 01:05:57.920
AGAIN I KNOW YOU'VE HEARD IT

01:05:57.987 --> 01:05:59.288
AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN THIS

01:05:59.355 --> 01:06:01.123
IS NOT YOUR FIRST RODEO TO

01:06:01.190 --> 01:06:02.958
STICK WITH THE HORSE METAPHOR.

01:06:03.025 --> 01:06:05.661
I IN TERMS OF BEING BEFORE

01:06:05.728 --> 01:06:08.264
DIFFERENT RULES COMMITTEES SO I

01:06:08.331 --> 01:06:09.332
JUST WANT TO UNDERSCORE THAT

AND APPRECIATE YOUR

01:06:10.099 --> 01:06:11.367
UNDERSTANDING OF THE FACT THAT

01:06:11.434 --> 01:06:13.869
WE DO TAKE THIS SERIOUSLY. ARE

01:06:13.936 --> 01:06:15.471
SOME OF US DON'T EXACTLY HAVE

01:06:15.538 --> 01:06:16.939
YOUR LEVEL OF EXPERTISE

01:06:17.006 --> 01:06:18.574
OBVIOUSLY SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES

01:06:18.641 --> 01:06:19.975
KNOW THIS ISSUE ENOUGH TO ASK

01:06:20.042 --> 01:06:22.478
INTELLIGENT QUESTIONS. BUT I

01:06:22.545 --> 01:06:24.547

I ACTUALLY DO NOT SEE MEMBERS

01:06:54.009 --> 01:06:56.178
OF THE PUBLIC HERE. AND I WOULD

01:06:56.245 --> 01:06:57.380
ASSUME THAT MEANS THERE'S NO

01:06:57.446 --> 01:06:59.048

I SEE NO ONE APPROACH IN THE

01:07:04.620 --> 01:07:07.456
PODIUM IN OUR ROOM ONE TWELVE.

01:07:07.523 --> 01:07:08.524
SO I'M GOING TO TURN TO OUR

01:07:08.591 --> 01:07:10.893

DISCOVERED THAT I STILL HAVE

01:26:37.792 --> 01:26:39.627
THAT SENSE OF AWE THAT I HAD

THIS IS FROM MY FAMILY. AND

01:27:06.354 --> 01:27:08.423
THAT IS A DEDICATION TO

01:27:08.489 --> 01:27:09.023
SPEAKING UP FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE

01:27:09.090 --> 01:27:10.858
MOST VULNERABLE. AND FOR THE

01:27:10.925 --> 01:27:12.860
VALUE OF THEIR LIVED EXPERIENCE

01:27:12.927 --> 01:27:16.397
ALONGSIDE THE EXPERTISE. OF THE

01:27:16.464 --> 01:27:18.900

BUT THERE'S A LOT OF.

01:27:22.170 --> 01:27:23.404
SCIENTIFIC EXPERTISE AND IT'S

01:27:23.471 --> 01:27:24.839
AWESOME I'M LEARNING SO MUCH

01:27:24.906 --> 01:27:27.609

THESE TIMES IN SITUATION RENT-

01:27:29.744 --> 01:27:30.511
BUT SO IS THE LIVED EXPERIENCE

01:27:30.578 --> 01:27:32.513
THE PEOPLE. WHO ARE MOST

01:27:32.580 --> 01:27:33.114
AFFECTED BY IT AND SO THAT'S

01:27:33.181 --> 01:27:35.249
SOMETHING I. I WANT TO KNOW IS

01:27:35.316 --> 01:27:37.619
KIND OF IN MY DNA- ON SURE

01:27:37.685 --> 01:27:38.786
QUICKLY A FAMILY STORY THAT I

01:27:38.853 --> 01:27:40.421
THINK. ILLUSTRATES WHAT I'M

01:27:40.488 --> 01:27:42.323
TALKING ABOUT IT IS ALSO

01:27:42.390 --> 01:27:42.790
RELEVANT TO THE DELTA

01:27:42.857 --> 01:27:44.692
STEWARDSHIP COUNCIL. MY

01:27:44.759 --> 01:27:48.229

FARMER. ON THE DELTA STARTING

01:27:51.899 --> 01:27:53.901
IN EIELSON AND ENDING. UP IN

01:27:53.968 --> 01:27:55.570
WHAT IS NOW NORTHERN. NORTH

01:27:55.637 --> 01:27:57.772
SACRAMENTO. HE GREW WALNUTS

01:27:57.839 --> 01:27:59.307
BLACK WALNUTS INSOLVENCIES

01:27:59.374 --> 01:28:02.510
CANDY- BACK THEN DURING THE

01:28:02.577 --> 01:28:03.044
DEPRESSION AND SOME YEARS

01:28:03.111 --> 01:28:06.014
AFTER. AND THERE WAS A STORY HE

01:28:06.080 --> 01:28:09.550
TOLD- THAT WAS ABOUT WHEN THERE

01:28:09.617 --> 01:28:11.419
WERE THE HEAVY RAINS AND THE

01:28:11.486 --> 01:28:13.121
RISK OF FLIGHT. TO THEIR

01:28:13.187 --> 01:28:16.891
FARMLAND AND HE STORY GOES AND

01:28:16.958 --> 01:28:19.560
HIS NEIGHBORS. AND MY UNCLES

01:28:19.627 --> 01:28:21.529
AND MY GRANDPA SENSE WOULD

01:28:21.596 --> 01:28:24.065
PATROL THE LEVY BACK AND FORTH

01:28:24.132 --> 01:28:27.135
IN THE RAIN. WITH SHOT GUNS

01:28:27.201 --> 01:28:29.904
BECAUSE THEY BELIEVED- WITH

01:28:29.971 --> 01:28:31.406
SOME REASON THAT IF THEY

01:28:31.472 --> 01:28:32.373
WEREN'T THERE TO PROTECT THE

01:28:32.440 --> 01:28:35.410
LEVY THAT THE MORE WELL HEELED

01:28:35.476 --> 01:28:37.879
INTERESTS WOULD ARRANGE FOR

01:28:37.945 --> 01:28:39.614
SOMEONE TO COME DOWN FROM THOSE

01:28:39.681 --> 01:28:42.183
AREAS AND INTENTIONALLY FLOOD

01:28:42.250 --> 01:28:44.085
BEFORE FARMS TO AVOID THAT

01:28:44.152 --> 01:28:46.154
HAPPENING TO THE MORE AFFLUENT

01:28:46.220 --> 01:28:48.156
AREAS OF SACRAMENTO. AND THAT

01:28:48.222 --> 01:28:49.323
STORY IS AN EXAMPLE OF

01:28:49.390 --> 01:28:50.758
SOMETHING THAT STUCK WITH ME

01:28:50.825 --> 01:28:53.695
ABOUT EQUITY. AND DEFENDING

01:28:53.761 --> 01:28:56.130
THOSE WHO ARE AT A DISADVANTAGE

01:28:56.197 --> 01:28:56.698
WHEN BIG DECISIONS ARE MADE

01:28:56.764 --> 01:28:59.233
ABOUT THINGS LIKE THAT. THE

01:28:59.300 --> 01:29:01.035
THREAT OF FLOODS IS STILL TOP

01:29:01.102 --> 01:29:02.036
OF MIND FOR VULNERABLE

01:29:02.103 --> 01:29:03.271
COMMUNITIES I'VE BEEN MAKING A

01:29:03.337 --> 01:29:05.606
POINT OF LISTENING ALL I CAN'T.

01:29:05.673 --> 01:29:07.175
TWO OF THOSE WHO COULD BE MOST

01:29:07.241 --> 01:29:07.842
IMPACTED BY SOME OF THE

01:29:07.909 --> 01:29:11.012
DECISIONS. YOU MAKE AND WE MAKE

01:29:11.079 --> 01:29:13.381
THE DELTA STEWARDSHIP COUNCIL.

01:29:13.448 --> 01:29:15.283
AND WHAT COMES UP MORE THAN

01:29:15.349 --> 01:29:17.118
ANYTHING FROM MARVEL

01:29:17.185 --> 01:29:17.952
COMMUNITIES ACTUALLY RISK OF

01:29:18.019 --> 01:29:20.688
FLOODS. ABOUT A FIFTH OF DELTA

01:29:20.755 --> 01:29:22.757
RESIDENTS ARE IN IMMINENT

01:29:22.824 --> 01:29:25.093
DANGER OF FLOOD. A CONSEQUENCE

01:29:25.159 --> 01:29:26.828
THE FUNDING OVER THE NEXT.

01:29:26.894 --> 01:29:29.530
SEVERAL YEARS SO I WAS I WAS

01:29:29.597 --> 01:29:32.467
LISTENING. TO YOU I MAJORITY

01:29:32.533 --> 01:29:34.168
LEADER HERTZBERG TALKING ABOUT

01:29:34.235 --> 01:29:35.870
ENERGY THE PREVIOUS HEARING

01:29:35.937 --> 01:29:37.705
WHICH IS FASCINATING TO ME- BUT

01:29:37.772 --> 01:29:38.773
EVERYTHING YOU SAID ABOUT

01:29:38.840 --> 01:29:40.742
CLIMATE CHANGE IS ALSO RELEVANT

01:29:40.808 --> 01:29:42.610
TO WATER AS YOU KNOW YOU WILL

01:29:42.677 --> 01:29:48.249
NOW- AND SPEAKING AGAIN ABOUT-THOSE WHO. STAND TO BE MOST

01:29:48.316 --> 01:29:49.383
IMPACTED BY THAT PEOPLE WHO

01:29:49.450 --> 01:29:51.152
DON'T HAVE A VEHICLE FLEET.

01:29:51.219 --> 01:29:52.353
WHEN THERE'S A CRISIS LIKE A

01:29:52.420 --> 01:29:54.689
FLOOD OR FIRE PEOPLE WHO WORK

01:29:54.756 --> 01:29:57.125
OUTSIDE. WHEN THE HEAT IS

01:29:57.191 --> 01:30:01.796
EXTREME. SO I WELL I. APPROACH

01:30:01.863 --> 01:30:03.931
THIS. IS SO FAR I WILL GOING

01:30:03.998 --> 01:30:05.833
FORWARD IN A BALANCED WAY. WHEN

01:30:05.900 --> 01:30:07.468
IT COMES TO SOME OF THE MOST

01:30:07.535 --> 01:30:08.002
CONTENTIOUS ISSUES AROUND

01:30:08.069 --> 01:30:10.772
CONVEYANCING- AND OTHER THINGS

01:30:10.838 --> 01:30:12.874
A COUPLE TALK ABOUT NOW. THERE

01:30:12.940 --> 01:30:14.442
IS ONE THING I AM JEALOUS ABOUT

01:30:14.509 --> 01:30:16.410
AND THAT IS HOW THESE ISSUES

01:30:16.477 --> 01:30:18.146
AFFECT PEOPLE WHO ARE MOST

01:30:18.212 --> 01:30:20.515
VULNERABLE HOW THE LEAST. VOICE

01:30:20.581 --> 01:30:23.017
SOMETIMES REALLY APPRECIATED.

01:30:23.084 --> 01:30:25.586
YOUR TIME. SURE I CAN TALK

01:30:25.653 --> 01:30:27.388
ABOUT IMPORTANCE OF GOVERNANCE

01:30:27.455 --> 01:30:30.792
AND PARTICIPATION IN COURT. YOU

01:30:30.858 --> 01:30:31.359
KNOW THIS HEARINGS A PART OF

01:30:31.425 --> 01:30:36.197
THAT THAT'S TERRIFIC. YES I

01:30:36.264 --> 01:30:37.465
COUNCIL THAT I SET OUT TO ASK

01:30:37.532 --> 01:30:39.033
QUESTIONS BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT

01:30:39.100 --> 01:30:40.635
I DON'T KNOW ASKING QUESTIONS

01:30:40.701 --> 01:30:41.903
IN PUBLIC FORUMS THAT THE

01:30:41.969 --> 01:30:43.838
ORDINARY PEOPLE MIGHT ALSO ASK

01:30:43.905 --> 01:30:45.540
AND SUPPORTING THEM WHEN THEY

01:30:45.606 --> 01:30:47.742
DO WHEN THEY SHOW UP AND TRYING

01:30:47.809 --> 01:30:49.410
TO MAKE SCIENCE MORE ACCESSIBLE.

01:30:49.477 --> 01:30:51.112
IN A WAY THAT. WE CAN REALLY

01:30:51.179 --> 01:30:52.680
HEAR FROM IN A MEANINGFUL WAY.

01:30:52.747 --> 01:30:54.649
PEOPLE ARE THE MOST TO LOSE.

01:30:54.715 --> 01:30:56.784
MOST AT RISK. IS SOMEBODY'S BIG

01:30:56.851 --> 01:30:57.752
ISSUES THAT WE'RE GRAPPLING

01:30:57.819 --> 01:30:59.754
WITH GROUND WATER CLIMATE

01:30:59.821 --> 01:31:02.723
CHANGE CENTER. SO I'M GONNA

01:31:02.790 --> 01:31:04.025
WRAP UP THEIR DISBURSING AGAIN

01:31:04.091 --> 01:31:06.561
I'VE HAD A LONG. HISTORY AND

CHAPTER SAID WELL MAYBE THIS IS

01:31:14.402 --> 01:31:15.570
HER ONE LAST CHANCE TO GET IT

01:31:15.636 --> 01:31:17.438
RIGHT AND SO IN THAT SPIRIT OF

01:31:17.505 --> 01:31:19.106
HUMILITY THANK YOU FOR YOUR

AND GOLLY LET ME START IN A

01:31:28.115 --> 01:31:29.784
DIFFERENT DIRECTION TODAY

01:31:29.851 --> 01:31:30.384
SENATOR GROW YOU WANT TO KICK

01:31:30.451 --> 01:31:32.620

APPRECIATE IT I HAVE THREE

01:31:37.191 --> 01:31:38.993
QUESTIONS IF WE COULD ANSWER

01:31:39.060 --> 01:31:41.062
AND I'LL TRY TO GO QUICKLY. AND

01:31:41.128 --> 01:31:42.663
WHAT KEY CRITERIA DO YOU

01:31:42.730 --> 01:31:44.832
BELIEVE THE DSE SHOULD BE OR

01:31:44.899 --> 01:31:46.067
SHOULD USE IN EVALUATING

01:31:46.133 --> 01:31:47.001
WHETHER THE ADMINISTRATION'S

01:31:47.068 --> 01:31:49.237
PROPOSED DELTA CONVEYANCE

01:31:49.303 --> 01:31:51.672
PROJECT IS CONSISTENT. WITH THE

01:31:51.739 --> 01:31:53.474
DELTA PLAN- THE REASON WHY I

01:31:53.541 --> 01:31:54.609
ASK THIS IS THERE'S A LOT OF

01:31:54.675 --> 01:31:55.877
QUESTIONS WHETHER THE DELTA

01:31:55.943 --> 01:31:57.044
CONVEYANCE PROJECT PUT IT TO

01:31:57.111 --> 01:31:59.313
ACHIEVE. THE REGULATORY

01:31:59.380 --> 01:32:01.148
APPROVALS NECESSARY TO PROCEED.

01:32:01.215 --> 01:32:03.484
AND WHETHER STAT WATER PROJECT

01:32:03.551 --> 01:32:04.685
EAT WATER USERS WOULD

01:32:04.752 --> 01:32:05.786
ULTIMATELY AGREED TO PAY FOR

01:32:05.853 --> 01:32:07.421
THE PROJECT IF IT IS APPROVED.

01:32:07.488 --> 01:32:08.890
AND IN YOUR VIEW WHAT STEPS

01:32:08.956 --> 01:32:10.892
WOULD- SHOULD WE STATE WE

01:32:10.958 --> 01:32:12.260
SHOULD WE TAKE TO CONSIDER

01:32:12.326 --> 01:32:13.494
MAKING TO APPROVE THE WATER

01:32:13.561 --> 01:32:18.232
SUPPLY. REBUT LIABILITY IF THE

01:32:18.299 --> 01:32:20.801
PROJECT DOES NOT MOVE FORWARD.

01:32:20.868 --> 01:32:21.369
I THANK YOU CENTER GROVE THE

01:32:21.435 --> 01:32:25.072
QUESTION. AB SO THE COUNCIL

01:32:25.139 --> 01:32:28.309
WILL BE RESPONSIBLE TIME NOT

01:32:28.376 --> 01:32:30.011
FOR LOOKING AT THE CONVEYANCE

01:32:30.077 --> 01:32:31.612
PROPOSAL HAS IT COVERED ACTION

01:32:31.679 --> 01:32:34.615
IN OF ITSELF BUT WITHIN THAT

01:32:34.682 --> 01:32:37.118
PROPOSAL I'M WE WILL BE LOOKING

01:32:37.184 --> 01:32:39.253
AT- THERE FOURTEEN REGULATIONS

01:32:39.320 --> 01:32:41.589
I BELIEVE THAT- WILL BE PART OF

01:32:41.656 --> 01:32:43.557
OUR REVIEW. THE ONES THAT

01:32:43.624 --> 01:32:45.359
REALLY STOOD OUT FOR ME IN

01:32:45.426 --> 01:32:47.028
PREPARING FOR THAT WITH THAT

01:32:47.094 --> 01:32:49.163
COMES AS I'M DOING NOW- ONE

01:32:49.230 --> 01:32:51.465
AGAIN AT TRIGGERING THE FOR ME

01:32:51.532 --> 01:32:52.800
WERE TO IS AN ISSUE OF REAL

01:32:52.867 --> 01:32:54.635
PORN STAR HOPE ALLOWED DOLLY AT

01:32:54.702 --> 01:32:57.171
THE COUNCIL THAT'S LOCAL INPUT

01:32:57.238 --> 01:32:59.073
IT THAT'S REQUIREMENTS. AND ONE

01:32:59.140 --> 01:33:00.808
THEY YEAH THE COUNCIL HAS THE

01:33:00.875 --> 01:33:04.045
AUTHORITY TO INSIST ON SO I'LL

01:33:04.111 --> 01:33:05.579
BE KEEPING A VERY CLOSE EYE ON

01:33:05.646 --> 01:33:07.248
THE OUTSIDE STERN AUTHENTIC WAY

01:33:07.315 --> 01:33:09.784
COLLUSIVE WAY GET A PEOPLE MOST

01:33:09.850 --> 01:33:11.285
VULNERABLE PEOPLE WHOSE VOICES

01:33:11.352 --> 01:33:15.656
SOMETIMES LET OUT A SHOUT- BUT

01:33:15.723 --> 01:33:17.158
DEFINITELY THAT THE- IT'S

01:33:17.224 --> 01:33:22.596
INFORMED BY SCIENCE. THE BEST

01:33:22.663 --> 01:33:23.864
AVAILABLE SCIENCE AND- MY THING

01:33:23.931 --> 01:33:24.465
I'M LEARNING IS THAT THERE'S

01:33:24.532 --> 01:33:25.800
KIND OF SNAPSHOT SCIENCE WITH

01:33:25.866 --> 01:33:27.501
THERE'S FOUR K. SIGN WHICH IS.

01:33:27.568 --> 01:33:29.236
SITUATION LIKE THAT SO THEY

01:33:29.303 --> 01:33:30.504
COULD BE IMPORTANT FOR ELEMENTS

01:33:30.571 --> 01:33:31.872
THAT PROJECT TO BE. EVALUATED

01:33:31.939 --> 01:33:34.608
BASED ON FORECAST SCIENCE-

01:33:34.675 --> 01:33:35.876
ANOTHER ONE JUST THAT I SEE AS

01:33:35.943 --> 01:33:37.912
IMPORTANT ALMOST TO YOU NOW WE

01:33:37.979 --> 01:33:40.514
CAN WRITE THIS TO YOU BUT- IT

01:33:40.581 --> 01:33:42.550
THOSE WHO BENEFIT FROM ANY

01:33:42.616 --> 01:33:44.719
CONVEYANCE. PROJECT WILL

01:33:44.785 --> 01:33:45.886
DEMONSTRATE YOUR REDUCE

01:33:45.953 --> 01:33:48.356
RELIANCE ON DETAILS. BECAUSE

01:33:48.422 --> 01:33:49.123
FOR US TO MAKE THIS ALL WORK

01:33:49.190 --> 01:33:50.992
COMMITTEE. PIECE OF THE PUZZLE

01:33:51.058 --> 01:33:52.626
ON THERE ARE FOLKS THERE IN

01:33:52.693 --> 01:33:53.394
THAT ROOM NOW KNOW THIS BETTER

01:33:53.461 --> 01:33:55.196
THAN I DO BUT- THAT'S AN

01:33:55.262 --> 01:33:57.398
ESSENTIAL PART. TIME THE

01:33:57.465 --> 01:33:59.400
COUNCIL SUPPORTS CONVEYANCE BUT

01:33:59.467 --> 01:34:01.235
IN ORDER TO DO THAT WE HAVE TO

01:34:01.302 --> 01:34:03.337
REDUCE RELIANCE. ON THE DELTA

01:34:03.404 --> 01:34:05.306
MORE THAN HALF. OF CALIFORNIANS

01:34:05.373 --> 01:34:08.142
TODAY. DEPEND ON DELTA WATER

01:34:08.209 --> 01:34:08.743
FOR SOME OF THE SOME OF THEIR

01:34:08.809 --> 01:34:10.878
DRINKING WATER- AND THAT'S

01:34:10.945 --> 01:34:13.614
THAT'S A HEAVY LOAD. SO SO THAT

01:34:13.681 --> 01:34:14.615
THOSE ARE THE CRITERIA THAT

01:34:14.682 --> 01:34:16.183
REALLY JUMPED OUT AT ME IN

01:34:16.250 --> 01:34:18.019
RESPONSE TO A QUESTION SENATOR.

01:34:18.085 --> 01:34:19.053
BUT THAT THERE ARE FORTUNATE WE

01:34:19.120 --> 01:34:20.287
WOULD YOU KNOW TAKE UNDER

01:34:20.354 --> 01:34:22.023
CONSIDERATION THANK YOU VERY

01:34:22.089 --> 01:34:23.457
MUCH AND WE DID BRING IT

01:34:23.524 --> 01:34:24.825
JINKING WATER AND THAT WAS A

01:34:24.892 --> 01:34:26.327
QUESTION THAT I HAD AS WELL.

01:34:26.394 --> 01:34:27.628
YOU KNOW REPRESENTING THE BACK

01:34:27.695 --> 01:34:28.629
OF THE VALLEY THE CENTRAL

01:34:28.696 --> 01:34:30.765
VALLEY I'D LIKE TO KNOW WHAT

01:34:30.831 --> 01:34:33.334
YOUR THOUGHTS ARE ABOUT- HOW

01:34:33.401 --> 01:34:35.202
DID YOU MEET THE NEEDS OF THE

01:34:35.269 --> 01:34:36.837
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES NOT

01:34:36.904 --> 01:34:38.305
SPECIFICALLY IN THE VALLEY BUT

01:34:38.372 --> 01:34:40.274
FROM THE VALLEY AND BEYOND. AND

01:34:40.341 --> 01:34:42.777
BALANCE THAT DRINKING WATER.

01:34:42.843 --> 01:34:44.945
FROM THE DELTA IN THE INTEREST

01:34:45.012 --> 01:34:46.680
IN THE DELTA SO. ARE

01:34:46.747 --> 01:34:47.848
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES IN

01:34:47.915 --> 01:34:49.216
THE VALLEY AND BEYOND I'M

01:34:49.283 --> 01:34:50.751
RECEIVE DRINKING WATER FROM THE

01:34:50.818 --> 01:34:52.053
DELTA AND I'M JUST CURIOUS

01:34:52.119 --> 01:34:53.654
ABOUT HOW. YOU'RE GOING TO

01:34:53.721 --> 01:34:55.790
BALANCE THOSE NEEDS WITH THE

01:34:55.856 --> 01:35:02.563
NEEDS- THAT THE. IN THE DELTA

01:35:02.630 --> 01:35:03.831
COMMUNITIES THAT THEY HAVE. YES

01:35:03.898 --> 01:35:06.600
SO I YOU TO- LANDED ON WHAT IS

01:35:06.667 --> 01:35:07.368
ONE OF THE BOYS IMPORTANT

01:35:07.435 --> 01:35:09.603
RESPONSE. OF THE COUNCIL ON IS

01:35:09.670 --> 01:35:10.871
RELIABLE RELIABLE SOURCE OF

01:35:10.938 --> 01:35:14.809
WATER. AGAIN I HAVE A HISTORY

01:35:14.875 --> 01:35:17.778
OF. SOME INVOLVEMENT WITH THE

01:35:17.845 --> 01:35:18.846
ISSUE OF ACCESS TO DRINKING

01:35:18.913 --> 01:35:20.981
WATER FOR ME IT'S A FUNDAMENTAL

01:35:21.048 --> 01:35:23.050
HUMAN RIGHT IT'S LIFE ITSELF AS

01:35:23.117 --> 01:35:25.786
YOU KNOW- I WAS AMONG THOSE WHO

01:35:25.853 --> 01:35:28.722
WAS STUNNED AND ASHAMED. WHEN

01:35:28.789 --> 01:35:30.658
WE DISCOVERED A SHORT TIME AGO

01:35:30.724 --> 01:35:31.258
THAT THEY WERE PERHAPS MILLION

01:35:31.325 --> 01:35:33.227
CALIFORNIANS. WHO DID NOT HAVE

01:35:33.294 --> 01:35:35.763
ACCESS TO SAFE HEALTHY DRINKING

01:35:35.830 --> 01:35:37.998
WATER AFTER BATHING DRINKING

01:35:38.065 --> 01:35:40.768
FOR COOKING AS YOU KNOW AB I

01:35:40.835 --> 01:35:42.703
DEEPLY APPRECIATE THE RESPONSE.

01:35:42.770 --> 01:35:44.105
OF THOSE OF YOU IN THE ROOM

01:35:44.171 --> 01:35:45.873
LEADERS IN THE ROOM RIGHT THERE

01:35:45.940 --> 01:35:48.609
ARE FOR SHARING SHOCK AND-

01:35:48.676 --> 01:35:50.978
DOING A LOT TO RECTIFY THAT I

01:35:51.045 --> 01:35:52.446
THINK WE'RE ON TRACK TO

01:35:52.513 --> 01:35:55.082
POTENTIALLY BEHIND US. BUT THAT

01:35:55.149 --> 01:35:56.650
THAT'S ONE OF THE TWO PILLARS

01:35:56.717 --> 01:35:57.518
OF WHAT WE SEE AS OUR OUR

01:35:57.585 --> 01:35:59.553
RESPONSIBILITY ON THE COUNCIL

01:35:59.620 --> 01:36:02.623
IS RELIABLE WATER THE OTHER IS

01:36:02.690 --> 01:36:04.225
TO PROTECT AND RESTORE THE

01:36:04.291 --> 01:36:06.527
DELTA AND WHAT I'VE TRIED TO DO

01:36:06.594 --> 01:36:09.096
IS NOT. SEE THOSE IN IN

01:36:09.163 --> 01:36:10.064
CONFLICT WITH EACH OTHER

01:36:10.131 --> 01:36:12.500
NECESSARILY BECAUSE THE FACT IS

01:36:12.566 --> 01:36:13.901
I'M LEARNING MORE EVERYDAY FROM

01:36:13.968 --> 01:36:16.837
SCIENTISTS BUT- A HEALTHY

01:36:16.904 --> 01:36:19.006
ECOSYSTEM. IS BETTER FOR

01:36:19.073 --> 01:36:21.575
RELIABLE WATER. AND THEY'RE NOT

01:36:21.642 --> 01:36:23.511
NECESSARILY AT ODDS BUT TO GO

01:36:23.577 --> 01:36:25.980
TO GET TO THAT PLACE. I HAVE TO

01:36:26.046 --> 01:36:27.281
RECOGNIZE THAT THESE TWO THINGS

01:36:27.348 --> 01:36:28.616
DO NOT ALWAYS HAVE TO BE IN

01:36:28.682 --> 01:36:30.017
CONTENTION MEANS WE HAVE TO

01:36:30.084 --> 01:36:31.218
LISTEN TO EACH OTHER BETTER

01:36:31.285 --> 01:36:33.120
BLAND'S SCIENCE I BE WILLING TO

01:36:33.187 --> 01:36:35.322
COLLABORATE AND COMPROMISED SO

01:36:35.389 --> 01:36:36.190
IT'S HOLDING THOSE TWO THINGS

01:36:36.257 --> 01:36:37.992
IN BALANCE. AT THE SAME TIME

01:36:38.058 --> 01:36:39.560
BUT I THINK THE PRIMARY FOCUS

01:36:39.627 --> 01:36:41.929
YOU GET ON IT. THE COUNCIL AND

01:36:41.996 --> 01:36:43.230
IN DOING SO RECOGNIZING THAT

01:36:43.297 --> 01:36:48.936
THE DELTA IS ALSO A PLACE. AS

01:36:49.003 --> 01:36:49.870
MY FAMILY HISTORY TELLS ME- AT

01:36:49.937 --> 01:36:51.372
TIMES. THE PEOPLE LIVE THEY-

01:36:51.438 --> 01:36:52.606
AND IT WOULD YOU HAVE TO BE

01:36:52.673 --> 01:36:53.841
VERY. OF THE PEOPLE THERE AND

01:36:53.908 --> 01:36:55.509
THERE LOOK THERE'S THEIR WITH.

01:36:55.576 --> 01:36:57.378
ARE IMPORTANT AS WELL. THANK

01:36:57.444 --> 01:36:58.712
YOU SIR I APPRECIATE YOUR HEART

01:36:58.779 --> 01:37:00.047
COMMITMENT TO THOSE COMMUNITIES

01:37:00.114 --> 01:37:01.348
THAT WERE WITHOUT WATER AND

01:37:01.415 --> 01:37:02.616
THAT COULD POSSIBLY BE WITHOUT

01:37:02.683 --> 01:37:04.685
WATER IN THE FUTURE. THE LAST

01:37:04.752 --> 01:37:06.287
QUESTION I HAVE IS IT DO YOU

01:37:06.353 --> 01:37:07.788
SEE A NEED TO BETTER RECONCILE

01:37:07.855 --> 01:37:09.657
THE TWO THOUSAND AND NINE.

01:37:09.723 --> 01:37:12.760
DELTA REFORM ACT- WITH HOW IT'S

01:37:12.826 --> 01:37:17.231
BEING IMPLEMENTED TODAY. I'M

01:37:17.298 --> 01:37:21.235
NOT SURE THAT I WOULD THANK.

01:37:21.302 --> 01:37:22.336
RECOMMEND THAT AT THIS MOMENT I

01:37:22.403 --> 01:37:24.171
WILL SAY- CAN YOU HAVE BEEN

01:37:24.238 --> 01:37:25.873
AROUND FOR A LONG TIME NOT IN

01:37:25.940 --> 01:37:27.942
THIS DEEPER LEVEL OF WHAT YOU

01:37:28.008 --> 01:37:30.277
WANT ISSUE AREA BUT- I WAS

01:37:30.344 --> 01:37:32.846
AROUND ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT-

01:37:32.913 --> 01:37:34.081
THERE WAS A TIME. WHEN WE WERE

01:37:34.148 --> 01:37:36.517
MUCH LESS. WELL COORDINATED

01:37:36.584 --> 01:37:38.018
THAT WE ARE NOW I REMEMBER

01:37:38.085 --> 01:37:39.119
WHEN. EVEN WHEN I WAS IN HIGH

01:37:39.186 --> 01:37:39.987
RANKING POSITIONS AND

01:37:40.054 --> 01:37:41.455
ADMINISTRATIONS IT WAS HARD TO

01:37:41.522 --> 01:37:43.157
JUST GET SIMPLE INFORMATION.

01:37:43.224 --> 01:37:45.125
BECAUSE THERE ARE SO MANY. A

01:37:45.192 --> 01:37:46.527
DIFFERENT AGENCIES AND

01:37:46.594 --> 01:37:48.495
JURISDICTIONS. NOT REALLY

01:37:48.562 --> 01:37:49.797
TALKING TO EACH OTHER VERY

01:37:49.863 --> 01:37:55.202
WELL- RIGHT IN AND A GREAT DEAL

01:37:55.269 --> 01:37:57.104
IN MY OPINION LACK OF

01:37:57.171 --> 01:37:59.106
TRANSPARENCY IT'S HARD FOR ME

01:37:59.173 --> 01:37:59.873
TO GET ANSWERS WHEN I COULD NOT

01:37:59.940 --> 01:38:01.642

01:38:01.709 --> 01:38:02.776
MATCH IF YOU'RE JUST A MEMBER

01:38:02.843 --> 01:38:04.378
OF THE PUBLIC RESIDENT

01:38:04.445 --> 01:38:06.247
SOMETHING AT STAKE IT WAS VERY

01:38:06.313 --> 01:38:07.381
DIFFICULT TO GET A STRAIGHT

01:38:07.448 --> 01:38:09.250
ANSWER CONSISTENT ANSWERS IT'S

01:38:09.316 --> 01:38:11.885

IN TERMS OF COORDINATION-

01:38:14.355 --> 01:38:16.957

CONVEYANCE AND WAS DEDICATED

01:39:42.910 --> 01:39:44.211
AGAINST US AND THEN WORKED FOR

01:39:44.278 --> 01:39:45.713
JERRY BROWN FOR EIGHT YEARS

01:39:45.779 --> 01:39:47.247

AND SO. YOU KNOW I WORK FOR

01:39:49.850 --> 01:39:51.352
PEOPLE THAT HAVE FIRMLY BEEN ON

01:39:51.418 --> 01:39:53.220
BOTH SIDES OF THE ISSUE THEN I

01:39:53.287 --> 01:39:55.289
THINK THE DANIEL THE ONE THING

01:39:55.356 --> 01:39:59.026
I WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT IT IT'S

01:39:59.093 --> 01:40:01.061
A LITTLE. I TAKE OFF ON SENATOR.

01:40:01.128 --> 01:40:02.963
QUESTION A AND IT'S BASICALLY

01:40:03.030 --> 01:40:05.733
THAT. THAT THE DELTA REFORM ACT

01:40:05.799 --> 01:40:08.268
IN TWO THOUSAND NINE. ARE YOU

01:40:08.335 --> 01:40:09.503
TALKED ABOUT GOVERNMENT SHOULD

01:40:09.570 --> 01:40:11.905
SET UP ALL THIS GOVERNMENTS. SO

01:40:11.972 --> 01:40:13.640
YOU HAVE THE DELTA CONSERVANCY%

01:40:13.707 --> 01:40:14.541
THAT'S DOING HABITAT

01:40:14.608 --> 01:40:17.911
RESTORATION YOU HAVE- THE-

01:40:17.978 --> 01:40:19.747
DELTA PROTECTION COMMISSION

01:40:19.813 --> 01:40:21.715
THEN YOU HAVE THE- THE DELTA

01:40:21.782 --> 01:40:23.050
STEWARDSHIP COUNCIL THIS IS

01:40:23.117 --> 01:40:24.385
JUST COMPLETELY SEPARATE FROM

01:40:24.451 --> 01:40:27.121
EVERY STATE AND LOCAL AGENCY OR

01:40:27.187 --> 01:40:28.155
FEDERAL AGENCY THAT DOES IT

01:40:28.222 --> 01:40:30.557
TOO. SO THERE'S JUSTICE ANALYST

01:40:30.624 --> 01:40:32.793
JURISDICTION THAT EVERYBODY HAS

01:40:32.860 --> 01:40:35.329
ON THIS ISSUE. AND THE- THE

01:40:35.396 --> 01:40:36.830
STEWARDSHIP COUNCIL WAS CREATED

01:40:36.897 --> 01:40:39.633
PRIMARILY TO REVIEW AGAINST

01:40:39.700 --> 01:40:42.469
SCIENCE A CONVEYANCE- PROJECT

01:40:42.536 --> 01:40:44.571
THE TWELVE YEARS LATER HAS

01:40:44.638 --> 01:40:47.141
NEVER COME FORWARD TO THE- ODD

01:40:47.207 --> 01:40:50.911
TO THE STEWARDSHIP COUNCIL. AND

01:40:50.978 --> 01:40:51.979
SO THE QUESTION IS. WHAT'S THE

01:40:52.045 --> 01:40:54.014
FUTURE OF THE DELTA STEWARDSHIP

01:40:54.081 --> 01:40:55.949
COUNCIL DO YOU THINK THIS IS A

01:40:56.016 --> 01:40:58.152
AN AGENCY THAT IS NOW CREATED A

01:40:58.218 --> 01:41:00.254
MISSION DO YOU THINK ONCE IT

01:41:00.320 --> 01:41:02.256
REVIEWS A CONVEYANCE PROJECT IN

01:41:02.322 --> 01:41:03.624
DEALS WITH THAT THAT IT IS

01:41:03.690 --> 01:41:05.893
LIVED OUT ITS MISSION. WHAT DO

01:41:05.959 --> 01:41:07.327
YOU THINK THE FUTURE OF THE

01:41:07.394 --> 01:41:10.497
AGENCIES. THAT'S A GREAT

01:41:10.564 --> 01:41:12.132
QUESTION- SOONER THAN LIKE TO

01:41:12.199 --> 01:41:14.067
GIVE MORE THOUGHT TO I MEAN I

01:41:14.134 --> 01:41:16.303
WILL SAY. FROM THIS VANTAGE

01:41:16.370 --> 01:41:17.838
POINT AND THIS IS NEW FOR ME AS

01:41:17.905 --> 01:41:19.940
YOU KNOW I. GENERALLY IS IT

01:41:20.007 --> 01:41:22.009
PASSED FROM CITY. LANDSCAPE

01:41:22.075 --> 01:41:23.844
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. AGENCIES

01:41:23.911 --> 01:41:24.478
AND DEPARTMENTS AND HOW THEY'RE

01:41:24.545 --> 01:41:25.813
INTERACTING WITH EACH OTHER NOW

01:41:25.879 --> 01:41:28.081
I'M LOOKING AT IT FROM. FROM

01:41:28.148 --> 01:41:29.716
ONE PIECE OF THE PUZZLE. I WILL

01:41:29.783 --> 01:41:31.685
SAY THAT- PERSONALLY EXECUTIVE

01:41:31.752 --> 01:41:35.122
DIRECTOR JESSICA PERSON IS

01:41:35.189 --> 01:41:36.590
OUTSTANDING. SHE SEEMS TO

01:41:36.657 --> 01:41:39.760
UNDERSTAND. IT BETTER COR. SAID

01:41:39.827 --> 01:41:41.495
GOOD GOVERNMENT IS NOT ABOUT

01:41:41.562 --> 01:41:43.363
EXERTING YOUR AUTHORITY OR

01:41:43.430 --> 01:41:45.299
POWER IS MORE ABOUT INFLUNCE.

01:41:45.365 --> 01:41:46.533
AND THE DELTA COUNCIL DOESN'T

01:41:46.600 --> 01:41:47.868
HAVE A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF

01:41:47.935 --> 01:41:49.303
AUTHORITY OVER A LOT OF THINGS.

01:41:49.369 --> 01:41:51.705
AND THAT CEO OF JURISDICTION

01:41:51.772 --> 01:41:52.272
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT IS YOU

01:41:52.339 --> 01:41:54.675
KNOW. BUT SHE AND HER TEAM SEEM

01:41:54.741 --> 01:41:56.043
TO DO A VERY GOOD JOB OF

01:41:56.109 --> 01:41:58.312
BUILDING RELATIONSHIPS. SETTING

01:41:58.378 --> 01:42:01.849
TABLES ARE SHARING INFORMATION.

01:42:01.915 --> 01:42:02.749
AND NOT NOT JUST IN ONE

01:42:02.816 --> 01:42:04.585
DIRECTION WHERE YOU GET

01:42:04.651 --> 01:42:05.219
INFORMATION FROM ONE SURE WITH

01:42:05.285 --> 01:42:06.920
ANOTHER- THEY REALLY SEEM TO

01:42:06.987 --> 01:42:08.589
HAVE MASTERED. THANK YOU IT

01:42:08.655 --> 01:42:09.890
TOOK ME YEARS TO GAIN

01:42:09.957 --> 01:42:10.591
UNDERSTANDING OF THE

01:42:10.657 --> 01:42:12.893
GOVERNMENT. OF THE INFLUENCE

01:42:12.960 --> 01:42:14.695
CAN BE BETTER THAN THAT FORTY

01:42:14.761 --> 01:42:16.129
SO I THINK THAT IS DEFINITELY

01:42:16.196 --> 01:42:17.931
AN ADDED VALUE- BUT I'M

01:42:17.998 --> 01:42:20.934
COGNIZANT OF YOUR POINT THAT-

01:42:21.001 --> 01:42:22.402
CONVEYANCE. IT'S KIND OF A

01:42:22.469 --> 01:42:23.837
CENTERPIECE OF A LOT OF YEARS

01:42:23.904 --> 01:42:24.538
YOU'RE SPEAKING AND

01:42:24.605 --> 01:42:26.373
UNDERSTANDING OF. WHAT WE'RE

01:42:26.440 --> 01:42:28.775

01:42:33.313 --> 01:42:35.249
THAT- NOT PLENTY TIME COME.

01:42:35.315 --> 01:42:37.718
WE'LL STILL NEED TO. THE TALK

TO STORAGE ACCOUNT BUT I WILL

01:42:38.385 --> 01:42:39.052
MY PRESS IS THAT THIS

01:42:39.119 --> 01:42:40.454
PARTICULAR TEAM OF PEOPLE ARE

01:42:40.521 --> 01:42:42.890
ADDING VALUE. TO A VERY COMPLEX

01:42:42.956 --> 01:42:45.359
DIFFICULT. LANDSCAPE ONE OF

01:42:45.425 --> 01:42:46.260
THEM LET ME ASK A QUESTION I

01:42:46.326 --> 01:42:48.028
WAS GOING TO ASK BUT IT BUT IT

01:42:48.095 --> 01:42:49.162
COMES FROM THAT I KNOW GOVERNOR

01:42:49.229 --> 01:42:50.397
BROWN WAS COMPLETELY

01:42:50.464 --> 01:42:52.599
EXASPERATED WITH THIS AGENCY A

01:42:52.666 --> 01:42:54.134
BECAUSE HE NEVER FELT LIKE THEY

PROJECT IF IT COMES IN FRONT OF

01:43:13.253 --> 01:43:15.622
YOU IN A WAY THAT. THAT YOU CAN

01:43:15.689 --> 01:43:17.624
APPLY THE SCIENCE AT ALL THE

01:43:17.691 --> 01:43:19.092
ROUND TABLES YOU JUST TALKED

01:43:19.159 --> 01:43:21.328
ABOUT TO JUST ARE ACTING ON

YEARS TO BE DECISIVE I LEARNED

01:43:45.652 --> 01:43:48.221
THE VALUE. OF MAKING A DECISION

01:43:48.288 --> 01:43:49.156
THAT THERE'S NEVER A PERFECT

01:43:49.222 --> 01:43:50.757
DECISION. BUT THE WORST

01:43:50.824 --> 01:43:52.759
DECISION YOU CAN MAKE IS TO

01:43:52.826 --> 01:43:53.327
JUST KEEP PUTTING SOMETHING
