THEY GET ONE MORE MEMBER ON THE STATUS OF SUBCOMMITTEE. PERFECT WE ARE GOING TO START AT THE SUBCOMMITTEE I HAVE. A COUPLE OF ANNOUNCEMENTS FOR TODAY'S HEARING. THE FIRST ONE AB SIXTEEN FORTY FIVE. BY MR MERCY SHE HAS BEEN PULLED BY THE AUTHOR. AND ACR. ONE THIRTY SEVEN EDUARDO GARCIA US BILL IS PROPOSED FOR CONSENT. BUT WITH THAT WELCOME HAPPY NEW YEAR EVERYONE MISTER SUN ON THE HAVE YOU BEGAN. A NUMBER OF US ARE SUPPOSED TO BE PRESENTING ANOTHER COMMITTEE SO I WAS DISASTROUS TO TRY TO BE MINDFUL OF THE TIME. THE FLOOR IS YOURS WE CHANGED IN A WAY THAT THAT BROUGHT FORWARD A PRODUCT THAT CAN THAT KEPT THAT. PULL TAB CAPTURED. THAT REALLY REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF THAT LITTER GOING OUT INTO THE ENVIRONMENT HOW WE'VE PROVEN WE CAN BAN PLASTIC BAGS WE'VE TALKED ABOUT. MICROBEADS WE'VE TALKED ABOUT EVERY NUMBER OF THINGS BUT IT JUST SEEMS LIKE IT'S TIME. THAT WE WORK WITH A. PROCESS TO ENSURE THAT WHEN BOTTLES COME BACK TO THE RECYCLERS THEY COME BACK WITH THE CAPS AND THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS IT OR IS IT ASKS. THE INDUSTRY TO ENSURE THAT BY TWENTY TWENTY. PRODUCTS ALL THE CALIFORNIA SINGLE USE PLASTIC BOTTLES WITH PRODUCT AND I WILL% COME BACK WITH A MECHANISM THAT ATTACHED THE CAPS YOU'LL SEE THERE ARE. EXAMPLES THAT ARE THAT ARE OUT THERE I'VE BEEN WORKING WITH. THE ORGANIZATION. THAT I THINK BEALL PLASTICS AND THEY RUN A THE CONTEST EVERY COUPLE OF YEARS IN THE LAST ONE THAT THEY RAN REALLY LOOKED AT IDEAS FOR TETHERING CAPS AND CAME UP WITH. WAS PRETTY INTERESTING IDEAS NOT AYE SIR ONE OF THEM. ALL OF THEM MAY NOT WORK SOME OF THEM MIGHT WORK BUT IT'S LONG PAST TIME THAT WE MOVE FOR WITH THIS NOTION OF INSURING THAT WE BRING BACK. THE BOTTLES AND THE CAPS TOGETHER SO THAT THEY CAN BE RECYCLED SO THAT THEY CAN BE PULLED OUT OF OUR ENVIRONMENT. AND NOT BE THE THE SIGNIFICANT DETRIMENT THEY ARE TO OUR WILDLIFE IT'S OR BEACHES INTO OUR. COASTAL AREAS. TO OUR DOWNTOWNS TO OUR PARKS TO OUR RIVERS AND STREAMS AND LAKES AND WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK HERE AYE VOTES I HAVE WITH ME TELLING ME BE FOR CALIFORNIANS AGAINST WASTE. AND THE PRESIDENT CEO OF CG ROXANNE LLC RONA AND POPPY ARTS BUT IF YOU DON'T MIND AND THEN I DO A COUPLE OF HOUSEKEEPING ITEMS JURORS FIRST OF ALL WE HAVE A QUORUM MINOR ROLE. PICKET TERRY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. GARCIA HERE. ACOSTA HERE. ALLEN. CHAO. EGGMAN. FLORA HERE. THE AMOUNT. MCCARTY. MURATSUCHI STONE FAIR. BUT SECONDLY CENTER HAVE A QUORUM THERE WERE TWO ANNOUNCEMENTS THAT WERE MADE MEMBERS THE FIRST ONE IS THAT AB SIXTEEN FORTY FIVE. WHERE ICICI HAS BEEN PULLED BY THE AUTHOR? AND ACR ONE THIRTY SEVEN BY MISTER GARCIA IS PROPOSED FOR CONSENT WITH CONSENT. SO MOVED TO HAVE A SECOND. MOVE BY MR SOUND SECOND WHEN MR CHOW. LET'S GO AHEAD AND TAKE A VOTE ON ACR ONE THIRTY SEVEN. THE ACTION IS. WITH THE CONCEPT RECOMMENDATION TO PASS GARCIA AYE GARCIA AYE ACOSTA AYE COST AYE ALLEN. ALLEN AYE CHOW. CHOW AYE EGGMAN FLORA. FLORA AYE THE MOON. THE MOON AYE MCCARTY MURATSUCHI STONE. BY STONE AYE. THAT IS THAT WILL KEEP IT OPEN FOR ABSENT MEMBERS. THANK YOU FOR INDULGING ME PLEASE. BUT ASSISTANCE TO REMIND THEIR TWO MINUTES AND I AM TIGHTENING. THANK YOU CHECK GARCIA AND MEMBERS KELLY MAKE THE WITH THE ENVIRONMENT NONPROFIT GROUP CALIFORNIANS AGAINST WASTE WE'RE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS BILL TODAY AS TETHER CAPS ARE A SIMPLE AND CONVENIENT TECHNOLOGY THAT IF IMPLEMENTED CAN HELP COUNTER THE EVER INCREASING THREAT OF PLASTIC POLLUTION IN OUR NATURAL ENVIRONMENT. CALIFORNIANS CONSUMER ELEVEN AND A HALF A BILLION PLASTIC BOTTLES EVERY YEAR. THE OPPOSITION WILL TELL YOU THAT EIGHTY THREE TO EIGHTY SEVEN PERCENT OF BOTTLES RETURNED FOR RECYCLING COME BACK WITH THEIR CAPS ON. AND SO THERE ISN'T A PROBLEM. THIS STATE OF FAILED TO RECOGNIZE BOTH THE SHEER VOLUME OF DATA BOTTLES CONSUMED IN THE REALITY THAT NOT EVERY BOTTLE SOLD GETS RECYCLED. SPIKE CALIFORNIA'S HIGH RECYCLING RATE AMONG ALL BEVERAGE CONTAINERS INCLUDING ALUMINUM AND GLASS WE KNOW THAT ONLY THREE OUT OF EVERY FOUR PLASTIC BOTTLES SOLD IN CALIFORNIA ACTUALLY GET RECYCLED AT THEIR END OF LIFE. IF WE ADD UP THE BOTTLE CAPS THAT ARE MISSING WHEN THEIR BOTTLE GETS RECYCLED AND THE BOTTLE CAPS THAT DON'T GET RECYCLED AT ALL WITH THEIR BOTTLES. WE SEE THAT AN AVERAGE OF NEARLY FIVE BILLION BOTTLE CAPS ARE ENTERING OUR ENVIRONMENT EVERY YEAR WHERE THEY ARE OFTEN MISTAKEN FOR FOOD BY MARINE WILDLIFE. IN ADDITION TO BEING ONE OF THE TOP THREE ITEMS FOUND IN ALL LARGE SCALE CALIFORNIA BEACH CLEANUPS BOTTLE CAPS CONTRIBUTOR URBAN BLIGHT IN OUR COMMUNITIES. A TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN AN RTC REPORT FOUND THAT CALIFORNIA MUNICIPALITIES WERE SPENDING NEARLY HALF A BILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR. CLEARING TRASH FROM STREETS PARKS AND STORM DRAINS THE CITY OF COMMERCE RANKED SECOND HIGHEST SPENDING EIGHT HUNDRED AND NINETY THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR. A MUNICIPAL SPENDING ON LITTER CONTROL IS ONLY RISING AS IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN CALIFORNIA ENACTED REGULATIONS REQUIRING ALL JURISDICTION. STOP TRASH FLOWS THROUGH THE STORM DRAIN SYSTEM BY TWENTY TWENTY TWO. IN A LAST POINT RECYCLERS WANT TO CAPTURE THE PLASTIC FROM CAPS THOUGH THE TECHNOLOGY IN USE TODAY AND THE BOTTLES I HAVE BEFORE ME. REQUIRE NO ADDITIONAL PLASTIC AND IN SOME CASES ACTUALLY USE LESS PLASTIC THAN TRADITIONAL CAPS. RECYCLING EQUIPMENT IS ALREADY DESIGNED TO HANDLE. THE BAND LEFT BY TEMPER EVIDENCE PROOF PACKAGING THAT BAND IS MADE OFA DIFFERENT PLASTIC THEN THE BOTTLE AND IT IS CURRENTLY BEING SEPARATED. SO WITH TETHERED CAP WOULD BE SEAMLESSLY INTEGRATED INTO EXISTING RECYCLING PROCESS THESE. ENCLOSING A TETHER TAP IS A WIN WIN SOLUTION FOR OUR ENVIRONMENT FOR RECYCLERS AND FOR PERSONAL CONVENIENCE AND IS THE ONLY SOLUTION THAT WILL PREVENT A HUNDRED PERCENT OF CAPS FROM BECOMING PLATE IN OUR COMMUNITIES. AND PLASTIC POLLUTION'S ENVIRONMENT I HEARD YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU THINKING NEXT WITNESS. BUT. TWO MINUTES SO. ITEMS IN THIS COMPANY AND WE HAVE DONE EXACTLY WHAT THESE. LADIES ASKING FOR WE DID THIS YEARS AGO FOR A COUPLE OF REASONS FOUGHT WARS OF REASONS THAT SHE EXPLAINED PLUS ONE. IT MAKES SENSE IT MAKES FINALS FINAL VOTE FINANCIAL SENSE DOCTOR YOU DO THAT. BECAUSE IT ALLOWS YOU TO GO WAS A LIGHTER PT BUT THERE HAS WHAT. SO FALLS A PRODUCER'S EYES OR SO AN INCENTIVE TO GOAL WAS A COP THAT STAYS. WAYS ABOUT HER ON OZ BEING SAY HAS BEEN SAID FALLS A RECYCLING IS ABSOLUTELY NO ISSUES. SECRETIVE GOOD THINK THIS IS WHAT WE DID BECAUSE WE OR SWEENEY CYCLING AND FOR US YOU KNOW I THINK HE'S GOING TO RUN FEET UP TO BE JUST ON THESE BEING RECYCLED MAKES NO SENSE. SORT IDEA WAS TO HAVE BOTH BEING A CYCLE BEING REDUCED. AND I THINK THERE IS NOTHING A LONG WAYS PRESIDENT. CAN YOU STATE YOUR NAME AND WHO YOU'RE WITH MY NAME IS OR NOT BUT YOU. AND I'M WE SEE JOKES ON A LOVE SCENE. CONDOMS OF PRESIDENCY WILL AS WELL AS A MANAGING PARTNER. THANK YOU APPRECIATE YOUR TIME. ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. YOU HAVE. AMIRI AM GORDON I'M WITH UPSTREAM POLICY AND WE'RE STRONGLY IN SUPPORT AND WOULD LIKE TO ECHO. MR PUPPY OWES REMARKS AND HE HAS TOLD US THAT THE. THEY ARE SAVING A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF PLASTIC AND MONEY AT THE SAME TIME. THANK YOU FOR THE REST OF US TO SEE YOUR NAME ORGANIZATION THAT IN CHURCH JUST MILAN FOOT TO OF ICONS HILDA BAY AND SURFRIDER FOUNDATION AND ALSO WE'VE BEEN OFSC CLEAN WATER ACTION.

ANALYSTS RIVERO HERE ON BEHALF DEFENDERS OF WILDLIFE IN STRONG SUPPORT. THINK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN THE US SUPPORT. OPPOSITION. CAN WE PLEASE MAKE A LITTLE ROOM FOR THEM AT THE TABLE. TWO MINUTES LINK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS FABRIC MCGEE WITH THE AMERICAN BEVERAGE ASSOCIATION AND UNFORTUNATELY WE HERE IN OPPOSITION TODAY. ON THE INDUSTRY IS CLEARLY NOT OPPOSED TO THE USE OF A TETHERED CAP. IN OUR PAST THAT. AUTHOR HAS MENTIONED IN HIS BEEN MENTION THAT WE'VE DONE IT WITH OUR CANS WHEN THE TECHNOLOGY WAS THERE AND AVAILABLE WE MAKE OUR BOTTLE BILLS ARE PT ONE HUNDRED PERCENT RECYCLABLE SO IT'S NOT A SPACE THAT WE ARE NOT. TRYING TO GET TO THE CHALLENGES IS THAT THIS BILL IS ESTABLISHES A DATE BY WHICH OUR TECHNOLOGY WON'T GET US THERE AND SO THAT'S MY MAINLY THE REASONS FOR OPPOSITION. I'M WE'VE CONTINUALLY TO SUPPORT A FINANCIALLY A WIDE RANGE OF EFFORTS TO MAKE SURE WE ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF. OF THE WASTE THAT IS COMING UP ON OUR BEACHES AND THE LETTERING BEFORE THE TECHNOLOGY GETS THERE FRANCIS IN OCTOBER OF THIS LAST YEAR YELTSIN CONSERVANCY ANNOUNCED A NEW INITIATIVE. THAT THEY WANTED TO RAISE A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS TO ADDRESS PLASTICS IN OUR OCEANS OUR MEMBER COMPANIES ARE PART OF THAT COMMITMENT AND WHERE THEIR. WE HAVE ALSO BEEN INVOLVED WITH OCEAN CONSERVANCY AND THEY'VE AND INDICATED THAT ALMOST HALF OF THE. PLASTIC THAT WE FIND COMES FROM FIVE DEVELOPING ASIAN COMMUNITIES THAT ARE OUTSIDE AB THREE NINETEEN WOULD IMPOSE UNWORKABLE. pSIMPLY NOT THERE THEIR PROTOTYPES THAT ARE THERE. ART WOULDN'T ACCOMMODATE A BOTTLE DEBTS THIS SIZE SO FOR INSTANCE THE BILL SAYS ANYTHING A LEADER. SORRY HE. AS OUR. ACCOMMODATE A BILL THAT'S ANYTHING A LEADER OR LESS. THIS IS LESS THAN A LEADER THIRTY TWO OUNCES BUT THAT THAT CRYSTAL GEYSER EXAMPLE COULD NOT ACCOMMODATE A WIDE MOUTH BOTTLE SUCH AS THIS. CARBONATED DRINKS AND HOT FILTERING SWITCHES WHAT THE BILL PROVIDES FOR STILL THERE IS NO TECHNOLOGY AVAILABLE RIGHT NOW TO PROVIDE FOR ATTENDED COPPER TAP FOR THAT KIND OF THE ARM. BEVERAGE AND SO THREE NINETEEN IS A ONE SIZE FITS ALL BUT THAT'S NOT THE REALITY OF THE TYPE OF BEVERAGES THAT ARE PRODUCED NOT ONLY IN OUR STATE BUT WORLDWIDE. CALIFORNIA PRICES A REAP A LEADER IN RECYCLING PLASTICS AND YOU'RE RIGHT THAT WE HAVE EIGHTY SEVEN PERCENT OF THE BOTTLES THAT COME BAGGED DO HAVE THEIR CAPS ON. WE CONTINUALLY HAVE THREE FOURTHS OF THOSE THAT COME BACK ULTIMATELY INTO THE RECYCLE STREAM SO THERE IS SOME WORK TO BE DONE CLEARLY BUT WE. DON'T WE CAN'T SOLVE THAT PROBLEM IF WE DON'T HAVE THE TECHNOLOGY TO DO IT. TETHER TAPS GENERALLY IN SOME OF THE PRODUCTS WOULD REQUIRE ADDITIONAL PLASTIC WHICH IS CONTRARY TOMORROW THE OVERALL GOAL OF TRYING HAVE LESS INTO OUR WAY STREET. AND SO UNTIL WE FIND OUT WHETHER IF IT'S A TETHER TAP LIKE ON THE GLEE. CRYSTAL GEYSER CAP A CUSTOMER. COULD STILL HAVE THE TOP RUBBING AGAINST THEIR NOSE OR THEIR MOUTH AND THERE'S NOTHING THAT WOULD PREVENT THEM FROM SIMPLY ON* THAT AND I STILL HAVING THE SAME PROBLEM THAT WE STARTED OFF WITH. SO WE HAVE BEEN TRYING TO WORK IN THAT INDUSTRY IS NOT LIKE WE'VE IGNORED THIS PROBLEM AND WE DIE FOR YOUR OP NO VOTE ON THIS BECAUSE THE TECHNOLOGY SIMPLY AS AN. IF. MR TURN MEMBERS BOB BACK ON BEHALF THE PLASTIC RECYCLING CORPORATION OF CALIFORNIA. NOT TO BE REDUNDANT FOR THE VERY EXCELLENT TESTIMONY FROM I AM I MISS PIGGY ABOUT THE IMPACTS OF THE BILL SO THE P. R. C. C. IS DEDICATED TO. A RECYCLING OF OF BEVERAGE CONTAINERS OF MADE A P. EIGHTEEN CALIFORNIA BUT THE PUBLIC BOTTLES AND THE CAPS. THERE A NUMBER OF ISSUES A WITH THIS MANDATED IT CERTAINLY IS BEING A PREMATURE IN TERMS OF ITS IMPACT ON A VERY WIDE RANGE OF BEVERAGES. AND IS THE AB LAID OUT A TALK ABOUT CARBONATION. AND THE IMPACT ON THAT CAP THEY BELIEVE THE TETHER IT COULD INVOLVE PLASTICS THAT ARE NOT COMPATIBLE WITH PT RECYCLING SO CONCERNED ABOUTTHE IMPACT ON. THE OTHER COSTS RECYCLING THE BILLY TO OFFICIALLY RECYCLE A WITH POTENTIAL CAMERA CONTAMINATION ON UNKNOWN TECHNOLOGY FOR AN UNKNOWN RANGE OF PRODUCTS THAT WE THINK IT'S PREMATURE. IT'S BEEN POINTED OUT THAT UP VERY HIGH PERCENTAGE OF CONTAINERS ARE COMING BACK WITH A CAPS A FIXED. WE SURELY WOULD ENCOURAGE GREATER PUBLIC OUTREACH TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO DO JUST THAT. AND THAT WOULD CERTAINLY ADDRESS A A LARGER PORTION PROBLEM. SHARE THE CONCERN ABOUT THE LITTER AND INAPPROPRIATE A DISPOSAL BUT AND WE HAVE TO. DISCUSS THE IMPACT ON THE ABILITY OF OF MANUFACTURERS TO PRODUCE THIS PRODUCT. WITH THE TETHER CAP OF THE VARIETY OF PRODUCTS THE COST TO DO SO WHEN THE TIMING FOR IT SO RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE THE BILL. THANK ANY OTHER OPPOSITION. BEFORE WE GO MEMBER COMMENTS THAT'S OKAY. THAT'S ALL BEYOND WE HAVE A GROCERY MANUFACTURERS A WE OPPOSE. THANK YOU AS OUR MINOR JUST NAME AN ORGANIZATION AND A POST. THIRTY YEARS THE CALIFORNIA LEAGUE FOOD PRODUCERS IN OPPOSITION. ANY MOSLEM HAVE THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER COMMERCE OPPOSITION. SHE THE BROWN CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURERS AND TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION ALSO POST. THERE THOMAS WITH LITIGANTS JOHNSON ASSOCIATES ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA BAR WATER SUSPICION IN THE INTERNATIONAL BOTTLED WATER ASSOCIATION OPPOSITION THANKS. OKAY THANK YOU I ANY. QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS. MR. ON CAN I ASK THE PROPONENTS TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF. TECHNOLOGY OR LACK THEREOF. WELL I THINK THAT'S. THAT THERE IS A GROWING. NUMBER OF IDEAS TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE COMING FORWARD THAT I THINK WILL SOLVE THAT THEIR PROBLEM. I HAD MET WITH THE INDUSTRY WHEN WE INTRODUCED THIS BILL LAST YEAR AND THEY WERE IN FACT ASKING FOR TIME LINES. I HAVE NOT HEARD FROM THEM WHAT AT WHAT A REALISTIC TIME I WOULD BE AND I'M HAPPY TO CONTINUE TO TO TALK TO THEM ABOUT THAT WE WE PUT A STAKE IN THE GROUND. HAS OF TWENTY TWENTY TO REALLY TRY AND SOLVE THIS PROBLEM. IF THEY'RE CLOSE IF THEY NEED A LITTLE BIT MORE TIME I THINK THAT'S FINE BUT YOU WE'VE SEEN SOME EXAMPLES. WHERE OTHERS HAVE COME UP WITH THAT OR NOT INDUSTRY HAVE COME UP WITH SOLUTIONS THAT ARE TETHERED THAT USE LESS PLASTIC WERE PRETTY MUCH THE SAME FORM? OF OF CAP AS OTHERS THAT ARE VERY LIKELY TO BE OF THE THROUGH THE EXISTING SHIRI THAT IS OUT THERE MEAN THESE MACHINES ARE TURNING OVER PRODUCTS. ZILLIONS OF PRODUCTS IN EVERY DAY. AND SO A A GOOD SOLUTION WOULD NEED TO WORK WITH OBVIOUSLY THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT'S THAT'S ALREADY IN PLACE. AND IF THERE ARE GOOD IDEAS THAT ARE COMING FROM PLACES THAT ARE NOT WELL FUNDED THEY DON'T HAVE MUCH INCENTIVE OTHER THAN THAT A REDUCTION I THINK THE INDUSTRY CERTAINLY. CAN MOVE TO BE ABLE TO FIT HER TO TAKE ONE OF THE SOLUTIONS OR COME UP WITH ONE OF THEIR OWN. SO I'D I DISPUTE THAT THERE IS NO TECHNOLOGY. I THINK THE TECHNOLOGIES ARE THERE OR ARE CLOSE AND THEIR ENOUGH EXAMPLES TO BE ABLE TO DRAW FROM TO BEN PUT THIS PROCESS ON A REALISTIC TIME LINE AND GET US. THE BOTTLE CAPS TO OTHER. I UNDERSTAND IT WAS A BILL SIMILAR BILL INTRODUCED IN A TWO THOUSAND NINE THEREABOUTS. R. AB NINE TWENTY FIVE SO. R.. THE BILL WAS HOLDING THE SENATE THOUGH WHAT WAS THE REASON WAS IT BECAUSE OF A TECHNOLOGY OR LACK THEREOF AS WELL THAT. I AM NOT SURE WHY THAT WAS HELD IN THE SENATE THERE ALSO HAS BEEN IF YOU GO BACK FAR ENOUGH. SOME OF THAT CAP MATERIAL WAS NOT QUITE ROUTE IS RECYCLABLE AS THE AS THE P. ET. THEY. THE BOTTLES THEMSELVES NOW THAT'S NOT THAT'S NOT TRUE THEY CAN CHOP UP THE PRODUCT IS A COMES IN AND THE CAT MATERIAL FLOATS SO THEY CAN BE SKIMMED OFF. SO RECYCLERS ARE NOW WANTING TO GET THE CAPS BACK BECAUSE THAT'S RECYCLABLE PRODUCT AS WELL SO THAT'S TAKEN AWAY THAT THIS NOTION THAT THE RECYCLERS DIDN'T REALLY WANT THE CAPS THAT MIGHT HAVE HAD. SOMETHING TO DO WITH. WITH THE ISSUE THAT THAT BILL HAD BACK THEN BUT THIS IS RIGHT NOW. THEIR CYCLES CAN CERTAINLY HANDLE THE PRODUCT WANT THE PRODUCT BECAUSE IT'S IT'S VALUABLE RECYCLABLE PRODUCT IN WE SHOULD ENSURE THAT THE CAPS ARE COMING BACK THE BOTS. CAN I ALSO ASK THE OPPONENT JUST ISSUE OFF OUT OF TECHNOLOGY IN AS FAR AS TIME FRAME IS CONCERNED WINDY EXPECTS THAT GO TECHNOLOGIES CAN BE. AVAIL GRATEFUL. MR SHALL ALL THE COMPANIES ARE INDEPENDENTLY WORKING ON IT THEIR FEARS COMPARED PET COMPETITORS IN THE MARKETPLACE SO IT IS JUST BECAUSE EVERYONE ON THE OUTSIDE DOESN'T SEE A SAMPLING IT. THAT'S NOT TO SAY THAT IT'S NOT GOING ON AND THEY HAVE BEEN A LOT OF TIMES WILL HAVE A PROTOTYPE THAT MIGHT WORK IT ORIGINALLY BUT AFTER IT'S BEEN TESTED. SHELF LIFE ONESELF WITH BALLS OFF THE SHELF IN THOSE KIND OF THINGS AND IT DOESN'T HAVE THE UMPS SAFETY REQUIREMENTS AT THE FDA REQUIRES OF US SO THE LONG TERM EVEN IF WE HAD A PROTOTYPE FOR FRANCE'S COCA COLA. ARE BIGGER PRODUCER IF WE HAD A PROTOTYPE THAT WAS READY TO GO RIGHT NOW TO GET IT IN ALL THEIR PRODUCTION STRAINED IT WOULD TAKE EIGHT TO TEN YEARS FOR THEM TO GET OUT THERE AND HAVE IT ON THE SHELF. AND THAT'S IF YOU HAVE ONE THAT'S HOT FEEL RECALL FILLED TO BE ABLE TO TEST IT OUT BECAUSE IT WON'T ALWAYS WORK THE FIRST TIME YOU DO IT YOU HAVE TO GO BACK. INTEMPERATE IN THAT'S THE TIMEFRAME THEY PROVIDED FOR ME EIGHT EIGHT TO TEN YEARS THAT'S GOVERNMENT PROVIDING. THE WORK WILL GO TO MISTER FLOOR ON YOUR. I GOT MORE THAN THE GODDESSES. REITERATE. AS FAR AS THE INDUSTRY'S PERSPECTIVE WHAT WOULD BE A REASONABLE TIMEFRAME TO GET THIS DONE AND IF YOU. THE AUTHORED MENTIONED YOU KNOW OF AN ACCEPTABLE TIME FOR WHAT WOULD THAT BE FOR YOU FOLKS. THE PROBLEM IS A MISTER FOR IS THAT WE DON'T KNOW WHAT WE DON'T NOW RIGHT SO WE DON'T HAVE A PROTOTYPE THAT HAS NOW. BEEN. SHOWN TO WORK ONE HUNDRED PERCENT OF THE TIME BEEN RELIABLE HAVE THE TAMPER RESISTANT. PROTECTIONS THAT WE NORMALLY NEED FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SO. IT IS HARD TO SAY YOU KNOW HARD CORE WE CAN DO THIS IN X. EUROPE WE HAD A PROTOTYPE IN ONLY QUESTION WOULD BE CHANGING OVER MACHINERY OR DOING THOSE TYPE OF THINGS THAT WE COULD GIVE YOU A HARD DAY. BUT WE DON'T HAVE SOMETHING AND THEN EVEN IF YOU HAVE ONE PROTOTYPE THAT'S AVAILABLE JUST WHAT'S JUST FOR ARGUMENT'S SAKE SAY THAT THAT EXISTS. YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE LEGISLATURE APPROVING POLICY THAT ONLY BENEFITS ONE COMPANY AND THAT IS NOT USUALLY A PLACE THAT THE LEGISLATURE LIKE SERBIA WHERE YOU'RE ACTUALLY DOING A WINDFALL FOR ONE COMPANY THAT EVERYONE OUT OF ALL THE BUT THE BEVERAGES THAT WE PRODUCE IN THE STATE. WOULD HAVE TO GO TO ONE COMPANY TO PRODUCE IT'S TOPS AND THAT JUST IS NOT A SPLIT GOOD PUBLIC POLICY IN THAT SPACE. AND THERE IS NO. DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN SMALLER COMPANIES A LOT OF THESE ETHNIC DRINKS THAT YOU SEE IN SOME OF SMALLER SUPERMARKETS IN THE LARGER CUP THERE'S NO. THEY'RE NOT EXEMPT FROM THIS BILL CORRECT THEY'RE NOT AND SO IF YOU HAVE A PRODUCT THAT MAY BE AN ASIAN PRODUCT OR SOMEONE SOMETHING FROM ONE OF OUR LATIN COUNTRIES. IF THEY CANNOT COME INTO THE STATE WOULD BE ABLE BE ABLE TO BE SOLD AND SOME ARE SMALL ETHNIC STORES ON BECAUSE THEY WOULDN'T COMPLY WITH THAT WITH THE PROVISIONS OF THE BILL THANK YOU. MS EGGMAN. ONE. THINK YOU AND I AM I APOLOGIZE MISTER STONE THAT I. CAN GET TO HEAR ALL THE TESTIMONY. AND I CAN I THINK YOU'RE JUST FIGURE BECAUSE THIS IS THE PROTOTYPE RIGHT I MEAN THIS IS THIS IS NOT A PROTOTYPE IT'S. READY TO GO. CORRECT DOWN. IN MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT YOU ARE ARE WILLING TO WORK WITH THE INDUSTRY AND WILLING TO DEVELOP APPROPRIATE TIME LINES IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO SEE THIS. M.. I I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS TODAY IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS WHERE. WHEN ONE PLASTIC NOWHERE TO WHAT TIME OF PLASTIC BAGS RIGHT AND I BY REPRESENT CENTRAL CALIFORNIA GONNA. A PAPER PLANT AND WE KNOW THAT PEOPLE GOES DOWN ON WE CHARGE FOR IT AND AS A DATA REPRESENTATIVE I DID VOTE FOR THAT. BUT WHEN I WAS A VOTER WHEN HE CAME ON THE BALLOT I DID. AND I HAVE SEEN A TREMENDOUS DECREASE THE AMOUNT OF PLASTIC BAGS FLYING AROUND I THINK WE ALL HAVE RIGHT IT WAS A BIG LEGO WE CAN IMAGINE. AND WE'VE SEEN A TREMENDOUS DECREASE. IS OVER THIS WEEK AND I KNEW THIS WAS COMING UP SO I JUST YOU KNOW. WRITTEN BY A REDCAR START LOOK AND YOU SEE THE CAPS EVERYWHERE ON THE GROUND STEP UNAMIR YOUR TOE EVERYWHERE ANYWAY. I DON'T KNOW THAT. YOU GET ALL THE WAY ACROSS THE FINISH LINE THIS YEAR. BUT I CERTAIN WILL BE SUPPORTING IN THIS COMMITTEE AND LOOK FORWARD YOU CONTINUE TO DO THE WORK SO WE CAN COME UP SOME REAL WORKABLE SOLUTIONS. AFTER CALIFORNIA THINK. US. TOMORROW BUT. THANK YOU SO MEMBERS THIS IS A REAL OPPORTUNITY FOR CALIFORNIA TO TAKE A STAND ON LETTER BOTTLE CAPS REGARDLESS OF THE STATISTICS ARE STILL. ONE OF THE TOP TEN THIRD FIFTH DEPENDING ON WHERE YOU COUNTED ITEMS THAT ARE FOUND IN BEACH CLEANUPS RIVER CLEAN UP SOME PARK CLEANUPS IF YOU START LOOKING AROUND NOW YOU'LL SEE HOW UBIQUITOUS THEY ARE. BECAUSE THEY DON'T END UP GOING BACK WITH THE BOTTLES. IF WE PUSH POLICY TO ENSURE THAT THE CAPS ARE CONTAINED OR ATTACH REASONABLY TO A BOTTLE SO THAT THERE'S A CHANCE FOR TO COME BACK AND. GIVE THE INDUSTRY THE APPROPRIATE TIME TO COME UP WITH MAYBE A LITTLE BIT OF A NUDGE A SPUR GET THEM TO TO COME UP WITH APPROPRIATE SOLUTION WE CAN SOLVE A BIG PROBLEM FOR CALIFORNIA. WHEN UP ANY PRODUCT WERE NOT TURNING A PRODUCT AWAY WE'RE TRYING TO SAY LET WORK WITH US LET'S CREATE A PRODUCT THAT FITS WITH CALIFORNIA'S ENVIRONMENTAL VALUES. THAT STANDS UP WE ALREADY HAVE ONE COMPANY HERE THAT THAT THINKS THIS IS A GREAT IDEA THEIR LARGE DISTRIBUTOR ACROSS THE STATE THEY'RE. THEY'RE DOING THIS ON THEIR OWN. THEY'RE DOING IT I THINK IN IN OUR MARKET IN OTHERS PROBABLY WITH WITH MULTIPLE PRODUCTS SO THE TECHNOLOGY IS REALLY THERE OR ITS NASCENT AND IT IS COMING IN CALIFORNIA SHOULD BE ON THE FOREFRONT. AND ENSURE THAT BOTTLE CAPS OR ATTACH THE BOTTLES AND WE HAVE THE BEST POSSIBLE OPPORTUNITY TO REMOVE THIS OFFENDING PLASTIC FROM OUR ENVIRONMENT WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR IT. TO THE BILL. THE MOTION IS THE PAST. ACOSTA. ACOSTA NOW ALLEN. ALLEN NO CHAO. CHAO AYE EGGMAN EGGMAN AYE FLORA. FLORA NO THE MOAN. THE MOAN AYE MCCARTY. MURATSUCHI AYE MURATSUCHI AYE STONE BY STONE AYE.
