COVERAGE. ASSEMBLY WILL SEVENTY FOUR BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER TING AND ACTUALLY TO THE STATE BUDGET TO TAKE EFFECT IMMEDIATELY BUDGET BELL. MISTER TECH. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER TODAY I AM VERY PROUD TO PRESENT AB SEVENTY FOUR OUR BUDGET BILL. AS YOU ALL KNOW MEMBERS THE BUDGET BILL IS THE CULMINATION OF MONTHS OF WORK. BLOOD MANY MANY HOURS OF HEARINGS IN OUR SUBCOMMITTEES. HOURS AND HOURS OF PUBLIC COMMENT IN TESTIMONY TO REALLY CRAFT THE STATE'S BUDGET. IN THIS YEAR WE HAVE A BUDGET THAT WE CAN ALL BE VERY PROUD OF FIRST OF ALL IT'S A RESPONSIBLE BUDGET. WE'VE SET ASIDE NINETEEN POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS IN RESERVES. BECAUSE AS OUR ECONOMY HAS BEEN DOING GREAT. WE KNOW THAT AT SOME POINT SOON A RECESSION WILL BE COMING AND THAT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE WE'RE SAVING THAT MONEY FOR A RAINY DAY. WE ALSO PAID FOUR BILLION DOLLARS. INTO OUR PENSION FUNDS CAL STARS IN CALPERS. WE HEARD FROM SCHOOL DISTRICTS ACROSS THE COUNTRY. ACROSS THE STATE EXCUSE ME ACROSS THE STATE IT HURT. THAT THEY WERE HAVING CHALLENGES AS WE HAVE. IMPOSED HIGHER PENSION OBLIGATIONS ON THEM. SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT ASSISTANCE REACHED CALPERS AND CAL STIRS TO REALLY HELP WITH OUR LONG TERM UNFUNDED LIABILITIES. WE INVEST IN YOUNG PEOPLE FIRST AND FOREMOST. WE ARE NOW AT A RECORD EIGHTY ONE BILLION DOLLARS IN PROP NINETY EIGHT K. THROUGH TWELVE FIND. THAT IS ALMOST DOUBLE THE AMOUNT OF PROP NINETY EIGHT FUNDING WHEN MY CLASS THE CLASS OF TWENTY TWELVE ENTERED. INTO THESE CHAMBERS. WE HAVE ADDED TEN THOUSAND FOUR DAY PRESCHOOL SLOTS. THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR KINDERGARTEN FACILITIES. TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR CHILD CARE FACILITIES. IN FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS WHICH AS A WORKING PARENT I KNOW THAT I COULDN'T BE HERE. IN WORK EVERY DAY IF IT WASN'T FOR THOSE AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS. THE EVENTS BUT DOESN'T STOP THERE BECAUSE FOR HIGHER ED. WE WANTED TO FOCUS ON ENSURING THAT THERE WERE MORE SLOTS AVAILABLE FOR CALIFORNIA STUDENTS. SO FOR YOU SEE WE INVESTED IN ALMOST FIVE THOUSAND MORE SLOTS. FOR GRADUATING CALIFORNIA STUDENTS. IN CS YOU WE INVESTED IN OVER TEN THOUSAND SLOTS. BECAUSE I KNOW MEMBERS ESPECIALLY THIS TIME OF YEAR WE HERE AT THE GROCERY STORE WE HEAR MORE OUT IN THE COMMUNITY HOW HARD IT IS FOR CALIFORNIA'S GRADUATED FROM HIGH SCHOOL. TO GET INTO OUR CRITICAL UC AND CSU UNIVERSITY SO WE'VE HEARD THEM AND WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S MORE ROOM. FOR CALIFORNIANS IN THOSE SCHOOLS. BUT IT DOESN'T END THERE BECAUSE WE HAVE TO INVEST IN CALIFORNIA'S WITH A HARD TIME PAYING [inaudible] FOR SCHOOL. WE ADDED ELEVEN THOUSAND COMPETITIVE CAL GRANT SLOTS THAT WAS CHAMPIONED BY TWO OF OUR LEADERS FROM SACRAMENTO RIVERSIDE THIS YEAR.TO REALLY MAKE SURE THAT THOSE WHO CAN'T AFFORD HIGHER EDUCATION REALLY CANNOT ONLY AFFORD IT. BACK GRADUATE WITHOUT ANY DOUBT. WE ALSO CONTINUED. MY COLLEAGUE FROM LA SHIPPING FOR FREE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SO NOT ONLY DO WE HAVE ONE YEAR FREE WE DON'T HAVE TWO YEARS OF COMMUNITY COLLEGE FREE. BUT AGAIN YOUNG PEOPLE IS NOT THE ONLY PLACE WHERE WE WERE INVESTED. WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT CALIFORNIA. WAS BECOMING HEALTHIER. FOR SO LONG WE AFRAID FOR SO LONG WE'VE BEEN MAKING SURE THAT MORE AND MORE CALIFORNIANS HAVE INSURANCE THANKS TO THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT WE WENT FROM 78% INSURED. THAT GAP IS GOING TO GET SMALLER THAT THEY PERCENT GAP IS GOING TO GET SMALLER TODAY. BY INVESTING SEVENTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS WE EXTENDED YOUNG ADULTS ACCESS EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY SIX YEAR OLD ACCESS TO MEDICAL. WE ALSO RESTORED MANY OF THE DRASTIC MEDI CAL CUTS THAT WERE REALLY DRACONIAN CUTS IN THE RECESSION OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHT WE ALSO HEARD FROM MIDDLE CLASS CALIFORNIANS THAT THEY NEEDED HELP WITH COVERED CALIFORNIA PREMIUMS. FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR COVERED CALIFORNIA PREMIUMS FOR OUR MIDDLE CLASS OR HAVING A HARD TIME AFFORDING HEALTH CARE. BUT AGAIN THAT'S OUR MIDDLE CLASS WE KNOW WE STILL HAVE ONE IN FIVE CALIFORNIA'S TODAY LIVING IN POVERTY. AND THAT HAS TO BE SOMETHING THAT IS ONE OF OUR MAJOR FOCUS IS. SO WE EXPANDED. THE RATES AT THE DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS. IT'S NOT ENOUGH. IT'S NOT WHAT THEY NEED BUT IT'S A HUGE DOWN PAYMENT. FOR THE FUTURE. WE ALSO CONTINUED. TO ADD MORE MONEY TO OUR CAL WORKS PROGRAM. BECAUSE FOR SOUL FOR SO LONG FOREST'S CALIFORNIANS. REALLY WE'RE NOT GETTING THE HELP THEY NEEDED FROM OUR STATE. WE ALSO AS AS MEMBERS YOU ALL KNOW WE HAVE A CRISIS. OF HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS. IN THIS STATE. SO WE ARE INVESTING ALMOST TWO BILLION DOLLARS. IN HOMELESSNESS PREVENTION SERVICES HOW AFFORDABLE HOUSING TAX CREDITS. IN LOCAL HOUSING PRODUCTION TO DEAL WITH THAT AFFORDABILITY CRISIS. WE'RE ALSO NOT SACRIFICING OUR ENVIRONMENT. WE'RE PAYING A HUNDRED AND THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS IN TO CLEAN IT AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER. ALMOST A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS AND A FIRE FAR CAPACITY AND AGAIN -- OVER A BILLION DOLLARS WILL BE SPENT IN TO OUR CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM TO REDUCE OUR GREENHOUSE GASES. AND LASTLY MEMBERS. WE OFFICE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE OUR COMMUNITIES ARE SAFE. SO WE ARE MAKING SURE THAT JUDICIAL BRANCH HOUSE ACCESS TO RESOURCES THAT THEY DESERVE FOR TOO LONG. THAT'S A BRANCH THAT WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO MAKE THE KIND INVESTMENTS THEY DESERVE. WE ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT. AS MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE GET THE KIND OF LEGAL SERVICES THEY DESERVE BECAUSE WE CAN'T HAVE A JUSTICE SYSTEM. IF ONLY ONE SIDE GETS A LEGAL HELP THAT THEY CAN PAY. FOR AGAIN MEMBERS TODAY I'M VERY PROUD THEY JUST WANT TO THANK ALL THE MEMBERS OF OUR BUDGET COMMITTEE. WE HAD FIVE AMAZING SUBCOMMITTEE CHAIRS WE HAD OVER THIRTY MEMBERS OF THIS BODY BE ON THAT BUDGET COMMITTEE. HOURS AND HOURS OF WORK I ALSO WANT TO A PARTICULAR THANK. THE ENTIRE BUDGET COMMITTEE STAFF BOTH FOR THE MAJORITY CAUCUS IN THE MINORITY CAUCUS THEY ARE THE ONES WHO REALLY HAVE DONE SO MUCH HARD WORK. THEY WERE UP TILL THREE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING MAKING SURE THIS BUDGET GOT PUT IN PRINT -- OVER THE WEEKEND. IT WITHOUT MEMBERS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AYE VOTE FOR AB. SEVENTY FOUR THANK YOU MISTER TAME MISTER OBERNOLTE YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I'D LIKE TO JOIN MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN FRANCISCO IN THANKING ALL OF YOU WHO HAVE BEEN PART OF THE BUDGET PROCESS -- THERE BEEN HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF HOURS OF HEARINGS OVER THE LAST SIX MONTHS AND I KNOW IT TAKES A LOT OF WORK FOR EVERYONE IN THIS CHAMBER TO CRAFT THE BUDGET. I ALSO LIKE TO JOIN HIM AND THINKING ALL OF OUR STAFF WE SAY THAT WE WORK HARD BUT OUR STAFF WORKS MUCH HARDER. AND IT'S BEEN A HERCULEAN EFFORT TO GET THIS BUDGET A TO THE STATE IT'S IN TODAY. I WANT TO START BY SAYING THAT THERE'S A LOT TO LIKE ABOUT THIS BUDGET. WE'RE MAKING VERY MEANINGFUL CONTRIBUTIONS TO OUR STATE RESERVES IN FACT WILL FINISH THE YEAR WITH ALMOST TWENTY BILLION DOLLARS OF RESERVES WHICH IS THE LARGEST RESERVE IN CALIFORNIA STATE HISTORY. BUT TO PUT THAT IN PERSPECTIVE THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST ESTIMATES THAT EVEN A MODERATE RECESSION WILL HAVE A SEVENTY BILLION DOLLAR IMPACT ON STATE REVENUE AND THAT THE TOTAL IMPACT ON STATE BUDGETS OVER A MULTI YEAR CYCLE WILL BE ON THE ORDER OF FORTY BILLION DOLLARS SO. IF OUR GOAL IS A STATE. IS TO HAVE A RESERVE POLICY THAT SUFFICIENT TO HAVE THE STATE BE ABLE TO WEATHER A RECESSION WITHOUT EITHER RAISING TAXES OR CUTTING SERVICES OF THE TIME WHEN IT'S LEAST CAN AFFORD TO DO THAT. THEN WE'RE ABOUT HALFWAY THERE SO THIS RESERVE POLICY IS A GOOD START WE'RE GONNA NEED TO STAY THE COURSE AND TO MAKE SURE WE GET THEIR OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS. HOWEVER I REALLY DISAGREE WITH THE WAY THAT WE'RE INVESTING THAT THE REST OF OUR BUDGET SURPLUS WE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY WITH THE SURPLUS TO SHORE UP OUR STATE SERVICES AND TO MAKE SURE THAT WERE FOR FILLING THE PROMISES THAT WE MADE TO CALIFORNIA. IN THE BASIC SERVICES THE STATE PROVIDES AND UNFORTUNATELY WE'VE ELECTED INSTEAD TO EXPAND OUR PROGRAMS IN TO CREATE NEW PROGRAMS AND I'LL GIVE YOU A COUPLE OF EXAMPLE. STARTING WITH MEDI CAL. THIS BUDGET PROPOSES A SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE IN ENROLLMENT FOR MEDI CAL AND THIS IS AN ERA WHEN MEDI CAL IS ALREADY FAILING TO PROVIDE THE SERVICES TO THE PEOPLE THAT NEED IT MOST IN CALIFORNIA. EVERY DAY OF MY DISTRICT OFFICES GETS CALLS FROM MY CONSTITUENTS WHO ARE UNABLE TO SEE A DOCTOR EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE TECHNICALLY COVERED BY MEDICARE BECAUSE FOR SO FEW DOCTORS IN MY DISTRICT. ARE ABLE TO TAKE THE LOW REIMBURSEMENT RATES THAT MEDI CAL PROVIDES. WE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO FIX THAT WITH THIS BUDGET AND WE'RE NOT DOING IT. I'D ALSO LIKE TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT K. TWELVE EDUCATION. THIS BUDGET PROVIDES A MODEST INCREASE IN PER STUDENT SPENDING BY MODEST I MEAN ABOUT IN LINE WITH INFLATION WILL BRING US UP TO JUST OVER TWELVE THOUSAND DOLLARS. PER STUDENT BUT TO PUT THAT IN PERSPECTIVE. ADJUSTED FOR THE COST OF LIVING IN CALIFORNIA THAT'S STILL RANKS AS FORTY FIRST. OUT OF THE FIFTY STATES SO GIVEN THAT STATISTIC IT'S NO SURPRISE THAT OUR TEACHER TO STUDENT RATIO IS THE LOWEST HERE THAN IN ANY STATE IN THE COUNTRY WE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO CORRECT THAT PROBLEM WITH HIS BUDGET AND UNFORTUNATELY WE'RE FEELING TO DO THAT. AND LASTLY I WOULD BE REMISS IF I DIDN'T MENTION. THE UNPRECEDENTED NUMBER OF LEGISLATIVE YOUR MARKS IN THIS BUDGET QUICKLY WE CALL THAT WORK. THIS BUDGET HAS MORE PORK IN IT THAN ANY OTHER BUDGET THAT I HAVE SEEN IN MY TIME IN THE LEGISLATURE. YEAH MOST TROUBLING IS THE PROCESS THAT WAS FOLLOWED WHEN THESE ITEMS WERE ADDED. ON SUNDAY MORNING -- DOZENS AND DOZENS OF LEGISLATIVE YOUR MARKS MYSTERIOUSLY WERE ADDED TO THE BUDGET. AND THE BUDGET CONFERENCE COMMITTEE VOTED ON THOSE ITEMS ON SUNDAY NIGHT THAT'S HOW QUICK IT WAS IF YOU ADD UP THOSE EXTRA ITEMS THAT'S OVER A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS OF LEGISLATIVE YOUR MARKS. THAT IS NOT A TRANSPARENT PROCESS COLLEAGUES AND THOSE YOUR MARKS HAVE NO BUSINESS BEING IN THE BUDGET AT THAT LATE DATE. SO GIVEN OF THOSE. PROBLEMS UNFORTUNATELY MUST URGE A NO VOTE ON AB. SEVENTY FOUR THINK OF A STRUGGLE TO MISTER MEDINA. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS I RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BUDGET. AS HAS BEEN STATED THIS IS A FISCALLY RESPONSIBLE BUDGET. WITH NINETEEN POINT FOUR BILLION IN RESERVE FOR FUTURE RAINY DAYS. IT INCLUDES INVESTMENTS IN EDUCATION COMBAT IN HOMELESSNESS AND SOCIAL SERVICES. IN PARTICULAR I AM PLEASED TO SEE THREE POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS DEDICATED TO THE MISSION HERITAGE PLAZA IN MY DISTRICT. A MIXED USE AFFORDABLE HOUSING COMMUNITY. AS CHAIR OF THE COMMITTEE ON HIGHER EDUCATION I AM PLEASED TO SEE FIFTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS BEING PUT. FORWARD TOWARDS ADDRESSING STUDENT HUNGER AND HOMELESSNESS ACROSS BOTH THE UC AND CSU SYSTEMS. FORTY NINE MILLION DOLLARS TO INCREASE RESIDENT UNDERGRADUATE ENROLLMENT. AT UC AND EIGHTY FIVE MILLION TO INCREASE ENROLLMENT AT CSU. I AM PROUD OF THIS BUDGET AND RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MISTER MEDINA MR MATHIS [inaudible] YOUR REDLANDS. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS. YOU KNOW THIS BUDGETS REALLY THE GOOD THE BAD AND THE UGLY. THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS HERE THAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON FOR YEARS. THINGS LIKE PRE K. [inaudible] SUMMER SCHOOL. MAKING SURE SOME OF OUR CAP AND TRADE DOLLARS ACTUALLY GO TO LOW CARBON [inaudible] INCREASING. THE RATES FOR MEDI CAL PROVIDERS. INCREASING CAL WORKS. MAKING SURE THE VICTIMS OF THE CAMPFIRE. GET TAKEN CARE OF IN INCREASING THE AMOUNT OF JOBS SHIPS THAT WE HAVE. FOR PUBLIC SAFETY BUT SADLY [inaudible] WE CONTINUE. WITH MISGUIDED PRIORITIES. WE'RE NOT PUTTING CALIFORNIA'S FIRST. WE'RE NOT PUTTING OUR VETERANS FIRST. WE'RE NOT PUTTING OUR PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES FIRST. WE'RE NOT PUTTING CALIFORNIA FAMILIES AT FIRST. INSTEAD THE BIGGEST INCREASE TO THIS BUDGET. IS FOR PEOPLE WHO AREN'T EVEN CITIZENS. AND SO WHEN WE LOOK AT THIS AND WE LOOK AT THESE PRIORITIES. IT'S ALL MESSED UP. THE IN HOUSE OF MY COLLEAGUE FROM BIG BEAR SAID. THIS IS GOT TO BE THE PORTEOUS BUDGET WE'VE EVER SEEN. I I THINK. THAT NOT EVEN PORKY PIG COULD DO A BETTER JOB AT THE PARK IN THIS. BUT WE GET WE CONTINUE. AND WE'RE WE'RE GONNA SAY ALL THESE GREAT THINGS ABOUT THESE SMALL MARGINAL INCREASES THAT WE'VE DONE THAT HAVE BEEN A LONG INFLATION RATES. BUT WE'RE NOT DOING NEARLY ENOUGH. WE'VE TALKED ABOUT HELPING THE DISABLED COMMUNITY BUT WE'RE JUST BARELY GIVEN A LITTLE BIT. I HOPE WE CAN FIX THAT WITH SOME TRAILER BILL'S. GOING FORWARD. BEFORE WE CLOSE OUT THE SESSION THIS YEAR. I I THINK THERE'S A LOT MORE WE COULD BE DOING FOR OUR VETERANS. IN THE BIGGEST THING WHEN WE START TALKING ABOUT HEALTHCARE FOR ALL IS THE ACCESS PORTION. AND MEMBERS I SAT AND BUDGETS OF ONE AND WE FOUGHT TO LOOK AT THINGS TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF PROVIDERS THAT'S THE DOCTORS. THAT OUR FAMILIES ARE HAVING TO WAIT TO GO SEE. SO WHAT WE'RE DOING AS I'VE SAID BEFORE AS WE ARE INFLATING THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE. THAT ARE GOING TO BE ON THE SYSTEM. BUT WE ARE NOT INCREASING. THE CAPACITY LEVEL WE'RE NOT GETTING. MORE DOCTORS IN THEIR WE'RE NOT DOING ANYTHING TO HELP THEM. IN TO HELP GET MORE PROVIDERS TO BE ABLE TO TAKE THIS INFLUX. IT'S GREAT THAT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE EVERYBODY IS HEALTHY WE ALL ONE HEALTHY COMMUNITIES WE ALL WANT. SAFETY INTERVIEWS WE ALL WANT THESE THINGS. BUT IT'S A MATTER OF PRIORITIES AND HOW WE DO IT AND HOW WE'RE TAKING CARE OF CALIFORNIA FAMILIES. AND PUTTING THEM FIRST. NUMBERS I ASKED THAT WE GET OUR PRIORITIES STRAIGHT AND I'M ASKING FOR NO VOTE ON THIS PORK. MR MCCARTY. YOUR RECOGNIZE. THANK YOU THAT MISTER SPEAKER I ALSO WENT TO RISE IN SUPPORT AND HE STEPPED AWAY BUT I WANT TO THANK OUR BUDGET SHARE FROM SAN FRANCISCO FOR ONCE AGAIN. DOING AN OUTSTANDING JOB TO TO BRING US TO A SPENDING PLAN THAT REPRESENTS OUR VALUES -- AS WAS NOTED THIS IS A SOUND BUDGET -- IT'S ON TIME AND FOR ALL THE TALK ABOUT HOW MUCH WE HAVE IN THE SURPLUS ROUGHLY THREE QUARTERS IS SPENT ON ONE TIME ISSUES FOR OUR RESERVES NEARLY NINETEEN BILLION DOLLARS. PAYING DOWN OUR WALLET DEBTS FOCUSING ON A RETIREMENT OUR SISTERS AND PURRS NEED SO THIS REALLY IS A RESPONSIBLE PLAN I WANT TO TALK FOR A FEW MOMENTS ABOUT EDUCATION THE ISSUE THAT I WORK ON AS CHAIR BUDGET SUB TO AND FRANKLY. ALL OF OUR TOP PRIORITY AND THIS BUDGET ADDRESSES I'M GONNA SAY OUR PRIORITIES OUR COLLECTIVE AND I'M SAYING AGAIN OUR BIPARTISAN COLLECTOR PRIORITIES FROM ALL OF OUR DISTRICTS ACROSS CALIFORNIA. AND I WANT TO TALK ABOUT WHAT THIS MEANS IN PLAIN ENGLISH BACK HOME IN YOUR DISTRICT -- ARE BUDGETS HERE OUTLINED SOME SPECIFICS THAT OF THE OF THE ISSUES BUT I'LL TALK ABOUT HOW THIS IMPACTS FAMILIES AND KIDS IN OUR DISTRICTS -- FOCUSING ON FIRST OUR YOUNGEST LEARNERS WE KNOW THAT. ECT MATTERS PRE K. MATTERS IT'S A PROVEN DIFFERENCE MAKER HOW WE BUILD UPON OUR ASSEMBLY BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION AND INVEST IN THE FUTURE. OVER TWENTY ONE THOUSAND FAMILIES WHO WERE ON A WAITING LIST WILL NOW BE ABLE TO ENROLL THEIR KIDS AND EITHER FULL DAY PRESCHOOL OR FULL DATE CHILD CARE. AND THIS WILL HELP THOSE YOUNGSTERS BE PREPARED TO SUCCEED IN KINDERGARTEN AND ALSO HELP THEIR FAMILIES -- GO TO WORK. ALSO FOR THE FIRST TIME FOR OUR STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAMS YOU HEARD FROM YOUR CONSTITUENTS THAT TOO MANY FAMILIES. ARE TOO RICH MAYBE THEY MAKE SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR A FAMILY OF FOUR TO GET FREE PRESCHOOL BUT THEY'RE WAY TOO POOR TO PAY UC BERKELEY TYPE TUITION. FOR FIFTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH TO SEND THEIR LITTLE ONES TO PRESCHOOL SO NOW FOR THE FIRST TIME. IF YOU WERE THESE MIDDLE INCOME FAMILIES AND YOU LIVE IN A HIGH POVERTY NEIGHBORHOODS YOU'LL BE ABLE TO GO TO OUR STATE FUNDED PRESCHOOLS. REGARDLESS OF YOUR INCOME SO WE HELP MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES THAT'S A BIG WIN IN THIS BUDGET. AS FIRES HIGHER EDUCATION AS OUR HIRE A CHAIR NOTED EARLIER THIS EXPANDS ACCESS TO OUR UC AND CSU WHAT DOES THIS MEAN EVERY SPRING I GUARANTEE YOU SEE PEOPLE OUT YOUR FARMERS MARKETS THE GROCERY STORES THE LITTLE LEAGUE IN SOCCER FIELDS. AND THEY SAY MY NEPHEW. MY NEIGHBOR MY SON MY DAUGHTER APPLY TO THE UC THEY HAVE A FOUR POINT THREE GPA THEY DIDN'T GET IN WERE ENROLLING TOO MANY KIDS FROM OUT OF CALIFORNIA. WELL THIS YEAR IN OUR BUDGET WE WE GREEN LIGHT FIVE THOUSAND NEW ENROLLMENTS LOTS FOR THE INVERSE OF CALIFORNIA THE HIGHEST NUMBER WE'VE EVER. PUT IN A BUDGET TO EXPAND ACCESS FOR OUR CALIFORNIA STUDENTS. OVER AT THE CSU WITH ABOUT THIRTY THOUSAND KIDS EVERY YEAR THAT APPLY FOR CSU BUT ARE DENIED ADMISSION THEY'RE ELIGIBLE RATED AGO WE DON'T FUND THE SLOTS. TEN THOUSAND NOR SLOTS IN THIS BUDGET. FREE COMMUNITY COLLEGE REGARDLESS OF HOW MUCH INCOME YOU MAKING CALIFORNIA FOR YOUR FIRST TWO YEARS AFTER HIGH SCHOOL YOU'LL BE ABLE TO GO TO COLLEGE FOR FREE JUST LIKE YOU CAN'T FOR ELEVENTH AND TWELFTH GRADE. FOR OUR CAL GRANT PROGRAM WE KNOW THAT THE TICKET. TO TO HIGHER EDUCATION IS IS FUNDING ACCESS TO COLLEGE AND WE KNOW THAT IT'S NOT JUST TUITION ANYMORE IT'S OTHER BOOKS AND HOUSING AND SO FORTH SO. ON OUR STUDENTS PARENTS WE HAVE A PROPOSAL IS GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT STUDENT PARENTS CAN GRADUATE DEBT FREE AND THE STUDENTS AND APPLY FOR COLLEGE IN THE CAL GRANT PROGRAM. COUPLE YEARS AFTER HIGH SCHOOL IF THE COMPETITIVE SLOT WE ALMOST DOUBLE THE NUMBER OF COMPETITIVE -- CAL GRANT AWARDS. LASTLY FOR A LITTLE MIXED BAG I CAN KERR WITH OUR MINORITY A BUDGET LEADER ON OUR K. -- TWELVE BUDGETS WE DO HAVE NEARLY THREE BILLION DOLLARS IN NEW MONIES FOR OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS THAT'S GOOD NEWS WE'VE INCREASE SINCE TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN EDUCATION FUNDING. BY THIRTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS THIRTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS WE HAVE MONIES FOR AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS WHICH HELP KIDS IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND OUR FAMILIES WE INCREASE SPECIAL LET FUNDING WITH ALL OF YOUR DISTRICTS HAVE TALKED ABOUT. AS A PRIORITY BUT WE'RE STILL FORTY FIRST IN THE NATION IN PER PUPIL FUNDING SO THIS FRANKLY IS A REALITY CHECK WE'VE DONE JUST ABOUT ALL WE CAN DO. JUST ABOUT ALL WE CAN DO TO SQUIRREL MONEY TO OUR TOP PRIORITY. PUBLIC EDUCATION PUBLIC EDUCATION BUT WE STILL HAVE DOZENS OF DISTRICTS ON THE BIBLE. MY DISTRICT HERE IN SACRAMENTO LOS ANGELES OAKLAND THAT ARE STRUGGLING MIGHTILY SO WE NEED TO HAVE A REALITY CHECK TO US AS FAR AS WHAT OUR VALUES WHAT ARE WE WILLING TO FIND. FOR PUBLIC EDUCATION BECAUSE WE'VE DONE A LOT HERE BUT IT'S NOT NEARLY ENOUGH WE STILL HAVE RIDICULOUS CLASS SIZES SCHOOLS THAT DON'T HAVE THE BASICS THAT WE REMEMBER WE WERE KIDS ARTS MUSIC P. ET -- WE HAVE MUCH MORE WORK TO BE DONE IN THIS EDUCATION AROUND SO I AM A STRONG I IN THE BUDGET BUT IT'S A REMINDER ABOUT MORE WORK NEEDS TO BE DONE. FOR A PUBLIC EDUCATION SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA THANK. DAVIS MCCARTY DOCTOR ARAMBULA. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER. I FIRST WANT TO START BY THANKING YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP MISTER SPEAKER ON THIS BUDGET AS WELL AS THE CHAIR OF BUDGET. IT'S IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE WHEN WE HAVE A FISCALLY RESPONSIBLE BUDGET THAT STILL STRIVES TO MAKE TRUE PROGRESSIVE SOCIAL CHANGE. AND THIS BUDGET DOES JUST THAT. I WANTED TO TAKE A MOMENT IF I COULD. TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE CONCERNS FROM ACROSS THE AISLE. BECAUSE IT'S OVERLY SIMPLISTIC TO LOOK AT ANY SINGLE PART OF HEALTH CARE. AND TWO ISOLATED WITHIN ABOVE. JUST LIKE YOU CAN'T SQUEEZE A WATER BALLOON AND NOT EXPECT THERE TO BE. SQUEEZING HAPPENING IN OTHER PLACES I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO LOOK AT THE TOTALITY OF HEALTH CARE SPENDING. SO IF I CAN BEGIN I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE MEDICARE I'LL RATE INCREASES THAT OCCURRED LAST YEAR WITH PROP. FIFTY SIX THAT WILL SIGNIFICANTLY ALLOW PROVIDERS TO KEEP THEIR LIGHTS ON AND THEIR DOORS OPEN AND TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN TAKE CARE OF MEDI CAL PATIENTS. I ALSO WANT TO SPEAK ABOUT THE LOAN REPAYMENT PROGRAM THAT WE DID LAST YEAR THAT WILL INCENTIVIZE PROVIDERS TO TAKE CARE OF MEDI CAL PATIENTS. FINALLY FROM MY COLLEAGUE FROM THE VALLEY. WE DID INCREASE THE NUMBER OF PROVIDERS IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY BY HAVING A MEDICAL SCHOOL START IN FRESNO LAST YEAR START TRAINING PROVIDERS. NOW IT'S OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO INCREASE THAT AND FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN MAKE SURE OUR MOST DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. ARE ABLE TO ACCESS CARE. NOW THAT BEING SAID. I AM GRATEFUL. THAT WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO EXPAND COVERAGE TO EVERY CALIFORNIAN BETWEEN THE AGE OF EIGHTEEN AND TWENTY SIX IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US. TO ALSO LOOK AT HOW WE CAN INCREASE THE ASSISTANCE THAT WE GIVE THOSE WHO ARE CURRENTLY ON COVERED CALIFORNIA. TO ENSURE THAT THEY CAN AFFORD THE CARE THAT THEY RECEIVE. THE FUNDING THAT WE'VE INCLUDED AND HAVE WILL USE TO HIRE SUBSTANCE ABUSE AS WELL AS BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PURE NAVIGATORS IN EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS WILL ALLOW US TO CREATE A MORE EFFICIENT HEALTH CARE DELIVERY SYSTEM. AND TO GET PEOPLE THE TREATMENT THEY NEED WHERE THEY NEED. THE FUNDING THAT WE HAD FOR TRAUMA SCREENING INCLUDED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET WILL ALSO ALLOW US TO DO THE IMPLEMENTATION AND TRAINING FOR PROVIDERS TO IMPROVE THE HEALTH AND WELL BEING OF OUR CHILDREN. THE FUNDING THAT WAS INCLUDED AS A NUMBER OF OUR PUBLIC HEALTH INVESTMENTS INTO BOTH STDS AND HIV PREVENTION AS WELL AS ASTHMA PREVENTION AND REMEDIATION SERVICES TO NAME JUST A FEW. THE ESTABLISHMENT OF OUR FAMILY URGENT RESPONSE SYSTEM TO HELP ESTABLISH AND MAINTAIN A STATEWIDE HOTLINE TWENTY FOUR SEVEN FOR CARE GIVERS AND FOR FOSTER YOUTH. WHO EXPERIENCE EMOTIONAL BEHAVIORAL OR OTHER DIFFICULTIES IN NEED OF IMMEDIATE HELP? THE FUNDING FOR THE IMMIGRANT JUSTICE FELLOWSHIP PROGRAM TO GROW THE NUMBER OF IMMIGRANT ATTORNEYS AND NON PROFITS PROVIDING REPRESENTATION OF REMOVAL DEFENSE REPRESENTATION IS IMPORTANT FOR COMMUNITIES LIKE MINE. BUT I COME HERE TODAY WEARING A BLUE COLLAR. NOT FOR ANY OTHER REASON BUT TO HELP TO REMIND ME OF THE COMMUNITIES THAT I COME FROM. BECAUSE WE ARE A BLUE COLLAR COMMUNITY. WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW AS A STATE TO MAKE SURE WE'RE INVESTING OUR BUDGET INTO SUPPORTING BLUE COLLAR COMMUNITIES. AND THIS BUDGET DOES JUST THAT. AND BECAUSE OF THAT I'M PROUD TO ADD MY SUPPORT AND URGE YOUR SUPPORT ON AB. SEVENTY FOUR THANK YOU DOCTOR IN THE MISS WALDRON. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER IN MEMBERS AS WAS STATED THIS BUDGET HAS A LOT OF GOOD THINGS IN IT ACTUALLY IT'S QUITE A BIT -- AS WELL AS THE PORK THAT WE ALL TALKED ABOUT -- BUT I'M HAPPY TO SEE THE GOVERNOR CONTINUES TO PRIORITIZE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES IN HIS BUDGET. THE NEW BUDGET INCLUDES A HUNDRED MILLION TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS. BUT WE HAVE TO DO MORE TO ENSURE THAT EFFECTIVE TREATMENT IS AVAILABLE. FOR CALIFORNIANS STRUGGLING WITH ADDICTION. LIKE FUNDING MEDICATION ASSISTED TREATMENT AT NARCOTIC TREATMENT PROGRAMS AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE'VE BEEN. TRYING TO FIGHT FOR FOR YEARS AND IT'S STILL NOT ADDRESS. WHAT ABOUT -- DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES COMMUNITY. WE CAN DO MORE. BUT ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE COIN NOT ALL CAREERS REQUIRE A BACHELOR'S DEGREE. IN FACT MANY CAREERS IN THE TRADES PROVIDE MIDDLE CLASS SALARIES THE CAN'T BE AUTOMATED LIKE OTHER JOBS. AND IT'S GOOD TO SEE A BUDGET THAT INVESTS IN CAREER TAX EDUCATION. AT OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES HOWEVER. THE DMV GETS A BLANK CHECK. TWO HUNDRED FORTY TWO POINT ONE MILLION. FOR TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY AND ONE NINETY NINE POINT EIGHT MILLION FOR TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE ALLOWING FOR MORE IF REQUIRED BASICALLY A BLANK CHECK. FAR TOO GENEROUS FOR DEPARTMENT RIDDLED WITH PROBLEMS. BUT ON A GOOD NOTE. THERE ARE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES FOR CAL FIRE. FOR MORE YEAR ROUND ENGINES HEAVY EQUIPMENT STAFFING AND SEE ONE THIRTY AIR TANKERS BUT THIS BUDGET DOES NOTHING TO HELP LOCAL AGENCIES REDUCE THE THREAT OF WILDFIRES CAUSED BY VEHICLES. IN SAN DIEGO NEARLY 25% OF WILDFIRES WAS STARTED BY VEHICLES. IN TWENTY SIXTEEN AND 201725%. WE CAN PREVENT UP TO ONE QUARTER OF WILDFIRES STATEWIDE. BUT THIS ITEM WAS IGNORED IN THE BUDGET DESPITE SUPPORT FROM FIRE AGENCIES FIRE CHIEFS AND RURAL COUNTIES. AS WAS STATED A HUGE A HUGE PRIORITY -- THE NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED AND HAS BEEN AN ISSUE YEAR AFTER YEAR AFTER YEAR IS ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE. ONE BIG STEP WOULD BE INCREASING REIMBURSEMENT RATES FOR PHYSICIANS AND PROVIDERS A MINUTE KILL. MEDI CAL AN EFFORT TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF PROVIDERS. IN OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. YET THIS BUDGET OPENS UP MEDI CAL TO MORE ENROLLEES WITHOUT ADDRESSING THE PROBLEM OF AXIS. SO IN ADDITION TO MY COLLEAGUE FROM BIG BEAR'S COMMONS. I WILL NOT BE SUPPORTING THE BUDGET TODAY I THINK THERE'S MORE THAT WE COULD DO ON OUR PRIORITIES THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISS WALDRON MISTER LEVINE. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER THANK YOU MEMBERS THANK YOU TO OUR OUR BUDGET SHARES ARE LEGISLATIVE LEADERS GOVERNOR NEW SOME FOR NEGOTIATING -- WHAT IS PERHAPS THE THE GREATEST BUDGET I'VE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO VOTE FOR IN I'VE I'VE HEARD IT REFERRED TO IN AND I'LL CALL IT. WHAT THIS BUDGET APPEARS TO BE LIKE THIS BUDGET? IS A UNICORN IN A SENSE IT'S NEVER BEFORE BEEN SEEN CERTAINLY NOT BY LEGISLATORS IN THIS GENERATION ONE THAT COMES WITH US WITH AN TO US WITH AN OPPORTUNITY TO SPEND. ON SO MANY DIFFERENT PROGRAMS THAT WE'VE BEEN LOOKING TO LIFT UP SINCE THE GREAT RECESSION. TO LIFT OUR SCHOOLS OUT OF OUT OF IT THE LOWS OF FUNDING. TO PAY DOWN BILLIONS IN PENSION DAT. AND INTO STOCK AWAY OVER NINETEEN BILLION DOLLARS IN A RAINY DAY FUND THAT WAS SET UP BY THIS LEGISLATURE IN TWENTY FOURTEEN I WITH THE VOTERS APPROVAL. BUT WE KNOW THAT UNICORNS DON'T EXIST. AND BUT JUST LIKE THIS ARE MORE OF A MIRAGE AND THAT IS WHY THE RAINY DAY FUND AND THOSE ONE TIME PAYMENTS ARE SO IMPORTANT TO MAKE OUR FUTURE YEARS. A WHOLE LOT EASIER. AND I THINK IT SHOWS THE DISCIPLINE. OF THE LEGISLATURE THAT SINCE WE WERE ELECTED WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO PAY DOWN THAT WALL OF DAT. OR WHAT I LIKE. TO THINK OF IS MORE OF A PIT OF BUDGETARY DESPAIR. THAT WE ARE ON BURDEN BY. INTO THE FUTURE AND SO I THANK YOU. FOR THAT DISCIPLINE OVER ALL OF THOSE YEARS AND I'M GRATEFUL THAT GOVERNOR NEW SOME HAS HELPED US TO FINISH THIS OFF SO THAT HE THAT HE DOESN'T ALSO NEED TO BE WEIGHTED DOWN. DURING HIS TIME AS GOVERNOR. I DID HEAR SOMETHING EARLIER THAT -- THAT OFFENDED ME THOUGH. AND I WANT TO TALK ABOUT. THE WAY THAT WE FIND THINGS IN THAT ARE MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITY. WE WERE TOLD THAT WE'RE DOING SOMETHING FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT AMERICAN. WE HAVE AN ECONOMIC AND AN ECONOMY. AND AND IMMIGRATION SYSTEM. THAT DON'T WORK TOGETHER BUT DEPEND ON ONE ANOTHER AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. WON'T TAKE A DANCE LESSON TO FIGURE THAT OUT. BUT THAT DOESN'T AFFECT US AND HOW WE TREAT. OUR NEIGHBORS AND MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITY. AND THERE IS NO OTHER REASON WE NEED TO JUSTIFY. HOW WE SPEND THIS MONEY IN FACT IT DEMEANS? HOW WE SPEND THIS MONEY? WHEN WE TRY TO JUSTIFY SPENDING MONEY TO SUPPORT OUR NEIGHBORS IN CALIFORNIA? I AM LOOKING FOR THE CASTING MY AYE AYE VOTE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MEMBERS. THANK YOU MITCHELL OF MAINE DOCTOR WOULD. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS I RISE TODAY IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THE BUDGET AND APPRECIATIVE OF ALL THE WORK THAT'S GONE INTO THAT -- I DO WANT TO POINT OUT. SOME THINGS AND AS IT THEM REGARDING HEALTH CARE IN REGARDING. WHAT I DIDN'T HEAR ABOUT A POPULATION OF FOLKS THAT? I THINK A REALLY IMPORTANT TO OUR SOCIETY. THEY SAY ARE BUDGETS A REFLECTION OF OUR VALUES AND WHAT I DIDN'T HEAR WAS. ABOUT INVESTMENTS IN SOME OF OUR SENIORS -- WE HAVE INVESTED HUGE AMOUNTS IN EDUCATION I'M COMPLETELY SUPPORTIVE I'M SUPPORTIVE OF ALL THE AT ALL THE OTHER INVESTMENTS WERE MAKING FOR FOR FIRE PREVENTION FOR IT FOR FOR ALL THESE OTHER PROGRAMS FOR HEALTH CARE ALL THESE EXPANSIONS. AND THEIR HUGE NUMBERS THE NUMBERS THAT I'M TALKING ABOUT OUR SMALL NUMBERS THAT AFFECT THE QUALITY OF LIFE FOR SOME OF OUR MOST VULNERABLE PEOPLE. WE ABOUT OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM FOR PEOPLE LIVE IN SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES THAT PROGRAM HELPS. PREVENT BAD OUTCOMES FOR PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN THESE FACILITIES THERE ARE THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE MEMBERS THAT LIVE IN A SKILLED NURSING FACILITY -- 40% OF THOSE FOLKS DON'T HAVE ANYBODY TO REGULARLY VISIT THEM. AND THIS SMALL PROGRAM OF THIS PROGRAM THAT MAYBE WE JUST ABOUT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS MORE. COULD HELP PROTECT THOSE SENIORS SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO GO AFTER AND BUYING OF FACILITIES WE CAN ACTUALLY WORK PROACTIVELY TO HELP PROTECT PEOPLE IN THESE ENVIRONMENTS -- THAT'S JUST ONE EXAMPLE OF OF SOMETHING WE COULD DO FOR SENIORS AND A SMALL AMOUNT OF MONEY COULD GO A LONG WAY WE PUT MORE MONEY INTO SENIOR NUTRITION. PROGRAMS WHICH IS GREAT EVER HEARD OF MEALS ON WHEELS I HAVE. YOU KNOW WHO FUELS THE MEALS ON WHEELS THE VOLUNTEERS WHO DELIVER THE MEALS EVERY DAY AND I FOUND OUT LAST FALL THAT A LOT OF OUR SENIORS WERE GOING TO LOSE A DAY A WEEK. OF A SENIOR OF THOSE MEALS ON WHEELS. WHY IS THAT IMPORTANT THAT'S THE ONLY CONTACT THAT PEOPLE GET SOMETIMES WITH THE OUTSIDE WORLD IS THAT DELIVERY THAT MEAL THAT'S A HEALTH CARE THAT'S A WELFARE CHECK AS MUCH AS IT IS A MEAL? THE TRASH IS TO HELP SUPPORT PEOPLE SO I AM VERY APPRECIATIVE THAT THE GOVERNOR IS GOING TO BE MOVING FORWARD ON THE MASTER PLAN FOR AGING AND I HOPE THAT A FUTURE BUDGET REFLECTS. THE SENIOR POPULATION THE FASTEST GROWING POPULATION IN OUR STATE OUR SENIORS AND GOD WILLING WE'RE ALL GOING TO BE THERE SOME SOME WAS ARE GETTING CLOSER. RIGHT NOW BUT GOD WILLING WE'RE ALL GONNA BE THERE SOME POINT AND BE ABLE TO LIVE THE QUALITY OF LIFE WE WANT TO IN OUR HOMES WITH THE BEST QUALITY CHARACTER SO I'M I'M VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THE BUDGET. BUT WHAT I DIDN'T HEAR WAS ABOUT IT AND INVESTMENT IN SOME MORE SENIORS AND I HOPE THAT WE OF DIG DEEP AND LOOK LOOK FOR THAT IN THE FUTURE AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH MEMBERS. THANK ADEQUATE MR HOLDEN. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS I RISE IN SUPPORT OF AB. SEVENTY FOUR I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE HARD WORK AND DIFFICULT DECISIONS NECESSARY TO COMPLETE A BUDGET. AND TO MEET TO THAT MEETS THE CALIFORNIA NEEDS NOW AND INTO THE FUTURE. THE BUDGET IS OF COURSE A STATEMENT. OF OUR PRIORITIES AND OUR VALUES. I'M HAPPY TO SEE THE RATE INCREASES TO SERVICE PROVIDERS TO SERVE OUR RESIDENTS WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. BUT THIS IS JUST A FIRST STEP. WE HAVE A RATE STUDY THAT SHOWS WE HAVE NEGLECTED ADEQUATELY FUNDING THESE SERVICES BY WELL OVER A BILLION DOLLARS. I LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH OF THE MINISTRATION AND LEGISLATURE. WE MUST FINISH THE WORK BEGUN WITH THE RATE STUDY BY IMPLEMENTING TRUE RATE REFORM. WE MUST FAIRLY AND ETHICALLY ADDRESS THE RISING COSTS OF WAGES OF LOS ANGELES. THE BAY AREA AND SAN DIEGO OR RISK THE NINE SERVICES TO THE MAJORITY OF OUR STATES RESIDENTS. WHO LIVE IN THESE AREAS? WE HAVE TAKEN AN IMPORTANT FIRST STEP WITH THIS BUDGET AND WE WILL CONTINUE OUR WORK SO THAT INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES RECEIVE SERVICES THAT THEY NEED. I RESPECTFULLY ASK HER ABOUT. THE THING IMAGE HOLD MISS MURATSUCHI [inaudible] YOUR RECOGNIZE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THERE'S A LOT. OF GOOD IN THIS BUDGET. YOU KNOW I I APPRECIATE HOW. THE CHAIRMAN OF THE BUDGET COMMITTEE. START OFF TALKING ABOUT HOW THIS IS A RESPONSIBLE BUDGET. EMPHASIZING HOW MUCH WE HAVE SET ASIDE. FOR THE INEVITABLE ECONOMIC DOWNTURN. WITH OUR RESERVISTS OVER NINETEEN BILLION DOLLARS THAT WE'VE SET ASIDE IT'S A RESPONSIBLE BUDGET. IT'S A BALANCED BUDGET. I ALSO APPRECIATE. THE CHAIRMAN OF OUR BUDGET COMMITTEE. FOCUSING ON HOW WE ARE MAKING SIGNIFICANT. DOWN PAYMENTS ON OUR PENSION LIABILITIES FOR BILLION DOLLARS TO ADDRESS. ONE OF THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES THAT WE ARE FACING. IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I HAVE TWO CONCERNS WITH THIS BUDGET. ONE IS EDUCATION YOU KNOW. WHAT THE BUDGET CHAIR IS IS CORRECT THAT WE ARE ALLOCATING EIGHTY ONE BILLION DOLLARS IN PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT DOLLARS MORE DOLLARS IN ANY OTHER TIME? AW. IN OUR HISTORY. I HAD TO CONFIRM YESTERDAY IN OUR BUDGET BRIEFING THAT THAT IS STILL. THE MINIMUM GUARANTEE UNDER PROPOSITION. NINETY EIGHT AND IT DISAPPOINTS ME THAT IN THIS YEAR WELL WE HAD OUR LA USC STRIKE OR OAKLAND STRIKE ARE SACRAMENTO SITUATION NEW HAVEN. WE CAN ONLY STILL FIND AT THE MINIMUM GUARANTEE OF PROPOSITION. NINETY EIGHT MINIMUM GUARANTEE MEANS THAT LET'S NOT BE FULL BY. THE DOLLAR AMOUNT WE ARE JUST ALLOCATING THE MINIMUM. THAT WE ARE REQUIRED TO ALLOCATE UNDER PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT WITH THE COLA ADJUSTMENT. THAT IS NOT BOLD MISTER GOVERNOR. IT'S THE MINIMUM. MY OTHER CONCERN [inaudible] IS WITH. THE SPENDING OF GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUNDS. FOR THE CLEAN WATER PROGRAM I FULLY SUPPORT. PROVIDING A MILLION PEOPLE WITH CLEAN WATER THAT. SHOULD BE A HUMAN RIGHT. AND WE SHOULD MAKE IT UP AS A PRIORITY [inaudible] BUT I OBJECT TO THE USE OF THE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUNDS. FOR THE CLEAN WATER PROGRAM. AS A MATTER OF THE INTEGRITY OF THIS BUDGET. MISS QUIRK SILVA. YOUR RECOGNIZE FROM THE DESK. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS. BUDGETS ARE A REFLECTION OF NOT ONLY WHO WE ARE BUT WHO WE REPRESENT. THEY'RE ALSO A REFLECTION OF OUR DISTRICTS SO TODAY I WANT TO THANK OUR A BUDGET LEADER I WANT TO THANK THE MOST THE MEMBERS OF THE BUDGET COMMITTEE WHO SPENT HOURS AND HOURS LOOKING AT PROPOSALS. AND LIKE ANY BUDGET OUR OWN PERSONAL BUDGETS WE ALL HAVE TO DETERMINE THE WANTS IN THE NEEDS SO AS FAR AS OUR INVESTMENT WE HAVE MADE AN INVESTMENT IN CALIFORNIA. AND IN OUR DISTRICT WE HAVE INVESTED IN CHILD CARE HEALTH CARE HOUSING HOMELESSNESS FUNDING MENTAL HEALTH FUNDING WE'VE INVESTED IN OUR STUDENTS. FOR STUDENT DEBT FOR MORE CAL GRANT. MANY MORE -- FIFTEEN THOUSAND GRANTS FOR THE COMPETITIVE GRANTS UP FOR STUDENTS WHO ARE VULNERABLE FOR HOUSING FOR FOOD AND SECURITY. WE'VE ALSO SAID TO ALL OUR FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS. THAT ARE OFTEN WORKING ON OUR HOTELS IN OUR RESTAURANTS THAT ARE OFTEN WORKING. IN OUR FRUIT WORKING IN THE HEAT ON OUR FARMS WORKING IN AGRICULTURE WE'RE INVESTING IN YOU TOO WE BELIEVE THAT YOU ARE DOING MUCH OF THE HARD WORK FROM CALIFORNIA AND THAT WE ARE GOING TO INVEST. IN YOU FOR HEALTH CARE. UP. AS A REPRESENTATIVE OF ORANGE COUNTY. WE ARE INVESTING IN ORANGE COUNTY WITH ORANGE COUNTY DELEGATION. BRINGING AND FUNDS FOR VETERANS FOR HOUSING FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGE THOSE ARE INVESTMENTS THAT I'M PROUD OF AND I'M PROUD TO SUPPORT THIS BUDGET. MEMBERS OF THE LIKELY RECOGNIZE PLEASE RAISE YOUR MICROPHONES NOW. THIS FRAZIER YOUR RECOGNIZE. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS -- AS I COME CLOSE TO ATTENDING THE SUMMER SPECIAL OLYMPICS NEXT WEEK. AND WELL THIS BUDGET PUTS FUNDING INTO PROGRAMS THAT SIR CALIFORNIANS WITH INTELLECTUAL DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. WE ALL HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE AREN'T DOING ENOUGH. AND WE'LL DO NEED TO DO VERY MUCH MORE. MAYBE EVEN THIS YEAR. AS A POSSIBILITY. FIRST THIS BUDGET PROVIDES FUNDING BUT DOESN'T START UNTIL JANUARY FIRST. AND THE FACT IS THAT SOME PROGRAMS JUST CAN'T WAIT THAT LONG. SECOND THE BUDGET GIVE SOME FUNDING TO SOME OF THE PROGRAMS. BELIEVES MANY OUT. AND THAT'S JUST WRONG. THESE PROGRAMS ARE STRUGGLING BECAUSE OUR STATE. PAST LEGISLATORS AND GOVERNORS. HAVE ONLY GIVEN THE SYSTEM TO INCREASES IN TWENTY YEARS. THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION REJECTED GIVING INCREASES TO SOME PROGRAMS A BELIEVE WILL BE OUT OF FAVOR UNDER FEDERAL GUIDELINES THAT ARE SUPPOSED TO BE IMPLEMENTED. IN. TWENTY TWENTY TWO BUT THESE TODAY THESE PROGRAMS ARE PROVIDING SERVICES SELECTED PEOPLE WITH IDT IN FAMILIES. APPROVED BY THE REGIONAL CENTER IN THEIR AREA AND YOUR AREA AND MY DISTRICT. UNTIL WE HAVE A PLAN FOR OTHER OPTIONS WE SIMPLY CANNOT ABANDON THESE PROGRAMS ARREST THEM FAILING BECAUSE WE THINK WE MIGHT NOT RECEIVE FEDERAL FUNDING. THREE YEARS FROM NOW. THIRD THE DEPARTMENT OF DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES SAID THEY MADE THE CHOICES TO FUND PROGRAMS THEY DID. BASED UPON THE RATE STUDY THAT THAT WAS RELEASED IN LATE MARCH. BUT WE ALL NEED TO KEEP IN MIND THAT THIS RATE STUDY IS NOT. FINALIZEDAND NOT ACCURATE IN MANY PLACES. THE DEPARTMENT TOOK IN CONTENTS FROM THE PUBLIC. WHICH INCLUDED. MANY ADDRESSING THE FLAWS IN THE STUDY. AND THE DEPARTMENT HAS YET TO ANSWER THESE COMMENTS. WE NEED ANSWERS AND IT'S OUR JOB TO PROVIDE THE OVERSIGHT NECESSARY. TO COMPEL THEM TO ANSWER. AND TO PUT A PLAN INTO PLACE. LASTLY THE RACE THAT HE SAYS WE ARE UNDER FINING THE SYSTEM BY ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS AND I BELIEVE THAT'S AN ACCURATE AMOUNT ALSO I THINK IT'S MORE THAN THAT. THIS BUDGET RESPONDS WITH A ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY NINE MILLION THIS YEAR. AND TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY EIGHT MILLION ANNUALLY. WE'RE KIND OF SHORT. AS I SAID IN THE BEGINNING WE'RE SHORTING THEM. BY ABOUT A BILLION DOLLARS OR MORE. AND WE NEED TO DO MUCH MUCH MORE. WE'RE ALL BLESSED IN THIS ROOM WITH A TYPICAL CHILDREN. MANY ARE NOT. I URGE YOU TO SUPPORT THE ID POPULATION. GOING. FOR THANK YOU MISS FRAZIER MISS MELENDEZ YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER. CALIFORNIA IS NUMBER ONE IN POVERTY. WE ARE NUMBER ONE IN HOMELESSNESS WE ARE NUMBER ONE IN VETERANS HOMELESSNESS. BUT WE'RE GOING TO SPEND THREE AND A HALF MILLION DOLLARS. ON A DOG PARK. HAPPEN MILLION DOLLARS ON A SCULPTURE GARDEN. TEN MILLION DOLLARS ON A PARKING LOT. ARE THOSE THE VALUES. THAT WE'RE SETTING TODAY THAT WE WANT OUR CONSTITUENTS TO KNOW ABOUT. MAYBE ARE HOMELESS AND HOMELESS VETERANS. CAN SLEEP IN THE SCULPTURE BECAUSE WE'RE NOT PROVIDING FOR THEM THIS IS SHANE PAUL. LOS ANGELES LAST YEAR SPENT OVER HALF A BILLION DOLLARS FIGHTING HOMELESSNESS. YOU KNOW WHAT THESE WHAT THEIR SUCCESS WAS. A 12% INCREASE AND HOMELESSNESS. THE STATE BUDGET THAT WE'RE ABOUT TO VOTE ON ALLOCATE NEARLY THE SAME AMOUNT OF MONEY. TO ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS IN THE ENTIRE STATE. SO WE SHOULD EXPECT A DIFFERENT RESULT REALLY. THIS IS RIDICULOUS YOU. YOU'RE GONNA SPEND THREE TO HAVE MILLION DOLLARS ON DOG PARKS COME ON THE HEALTH INSURANCE. IT'S A TAX. YOU CAN CALL IT A FEE YOU CAN CALL TO FIND IT IS A TAX. AND IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME LOOK BACK TO WHAT HAPPENED WITH THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE FOR MAMA CARE. THE SUPREME COURT SAID IT'S A TAX. AND SO IS THIS. SO GET READY TO GET CHALLENGED IN COURT I GUESS AND SPEND MORE MONEY ON LEGAL FEES THIS IS A TAX IS A TAX ON WORKING CALIFORNIANS. TO PAPER SOMETHING THAT LEGISLATORS WANT TO GIVE AWAY. YOU'RE GIVING OTHER PEOPLE'S MONEY AWAY. ONCE YOU GET SOME YEAR BILLIONAIRE. DONORS. TO PAY FOR THE HEALTH CARE ARE THE PEOPLE YOU WANT TO COVER. BUT STOP ASKING CALIFORNIANS ARE BUSTING THEIR TAILS EVERYDAY. TO MAKE ENDS MEET TO PAPER THINGS. FOR OTHER PEOPLE WHO AREN'T EVEN SUPPOSED TO BE HERE. I GET IT. IT SEEMS OFFENSIVE TO SOME OF YOU THAT I EVEN SAY THAT. BUT IT'S TRUE [inaudible] IT'S TRUE. AND I GET EMAILS FROM DEMOCRATS FROM. FROM NO PARTY PREFERENCE PEOPLE FROM REPUBLICANS ALL ACROSS THE SPECTRUM AND THEY ALL SAY THE SAME THING STOP SPENDING MY MONEY ON THINGS LIKE THIS. JUST -- TO PUT A FINAL POINT ON IT. RELATING TO THE HOMELESS. I NOTICED IN THE BUDGET. WE'RE TALKING BUT THE CONTINUUM CONTINUUM OF CARE FACILITIES. LOS ANGELES [inaudible] AT IS WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR TAKING CARE ABOUT 41%. AT THE STATE'S HOMELESS. HOW THAT HOW THAT WORKED OUT? A 12% INCREASE. SO I'M SORRY BUT FOR ALL THE PEOPLE WHO ARE SO PROUD OF THIS BUDGET I HAVE A VERY DIFFERENT OPINION. AND THOSE OF YOU WHO VOTE FOR THIS BUDGET TODAY SHOULD HANG YOUR HEAD IN SHAME. MR CHILL YOU ARE RECOGNIZED I'M JUST CAN BE VERY BRIEF -- I HAD A PLAN TO SPEAK TODAY BUT ONE JUST POINT TO THE FACT THAT THIS BUDGET HAS AN UNPRECEDENTED LEVEL. OF EXPENDITURES FOR HOUSING AND FOR DRESSING HOMELESSNESS CRISIS TWO POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS -- I THINK THAT'S ALL THAT NEEDS TO BE SAID. THANK YOU MISTER CHIU SEEING NO OTHER MEMBERS SEEKING RECOGNITION. ON THE BUDGET. ITEM MISTER TANG YOU MAY CLOSE. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER. GOVERNING IS HARD. SERVING THE PEOPLE [inaudible] IS DIFFICULT. THE PROBLEMS WE HAVE IN THE STATE [inaudible] WERE [inaudible] CREATED OVERNIGHT. IN THE CHALLENGES THAT WE FACE WON'T BE SOLVED. OVERNIGHT.

THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF SPENDING. FOR K. THROUGH TWELVE EDUCATION IS IT ENOUGH. NO. IT'S NOT ENOUGH. MORE MONEY FOR HEALTH CARE FOR MIDDLE CLASS CALIFORNIANS WHO HAVE TROUBLE PAYING [inaudible] PREMIUMS. WHAT WE LOVE TO DO MORE ABSOLUTELY? BUT WE CAN. FIFTEEN THOUSAND SLOTS FOR CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE NOW HAVING TO GO OUT OF STATE. BUT NOW THERE'S MORE OPPORTUNITY. THE UC AND CSU AND HOPEFULLY. THEY'RE GOING TO STAY HERE AND BE PART OF OUR GREAT ECONOMY. PEOPLE LIVING IN POVERTY. I KNOW WE DON'T LIKE TALKING ABOUT. DO THEY NEED MORE HELP YES. BUT THIS IS OUR CHANCE TO GIVE THEM WHAT WE CAN. IN ALL THE AREAS THAT WE TALKED ABOUT INVESTING WITH ITS EDUCATION HEALTHCARE THE ENVIRONMENT. ALL THE DIFFERENT SOCIAL SERVICES HEALTH CARE. WOULD WE LOVE TO DO MORE ABSOLUTELY. ABSOLUTELY EVERY DAY. IN BUDGET COMMITTEE WE HEAR PEOPLE I HAVE NEVER HAD A BUDGET MEETING WHERE THEY SAID THANK YOU WE GOT TOO MUCH THIS YEAR. HERE'S MONEY BACK.
