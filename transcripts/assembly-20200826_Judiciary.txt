OF TESTIFYING SO WOULD ASK THAT YOU DO THAT. ALL RIGHT THERE I THINK HAVING COVERED THE LOGISTICAL GROUND LET'S MOVE ON TO SENATE BILL SEVEN THIRTY ONE. SENATOR BRADFORD WELCOME INTERNET SECURITY THAT ONE I BILLS CONSIDERING FOR A MEASURE CALLED POLICE IN MANY WAYS PROJECTS GOT OFFERS FROM ABOUT ALL SB THREE ONE SEVEN FOUR OFF. POLICE TO SURVEY ARE GOING. ONE OF THEM FOR MANY CURRENT YEAR AND ALL THE MEN FOR ALL THEIR HARD WORK IN GETTING THIS BILL. TO IT IS THE DAY IN ORDER TO PROTECT FOR THIS FOR MANY. IMAGE WAYS THIS BILL IS THE FIRST. I LIVE IN ARGENTINA FOR. FIFTY ONE YEARS OF MY- HELLO AROUND THE CORNER FROM WALLY PUT. WHAT COLLEGE SPORTS SIXTY YEARS WHERE I PLAY SPORTS. AND LYFT A ANNUAL JEFF FESTIVAL LAST SUNDAY PROCESS WOULD HAVE BEEN MY EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD THE GUARDIAN JOBS FOR AFTER PARK. ROWLEY PARK IS TO SAY PART WERE KENNETH ROTH JUNE WE SHOT AND KILLED BY GUARDIAN PLAY OFFICER. AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN. MISTRUST IS A TWENTY ZERO WHO ON ALL. WHO IS THE- MENTAL. ANNE WAS SHOT IN THE BACK AND KILLED IN BROAD DAYLIGHT. MISTER ROSS WAS OF WIDELY KNOWN AND FAMILIAR WITH PARK STAFF HERE BECAUSE HE WAS A REGULAR IN THE COMMUNITY. THE NEW WE HAD IT'S CHALLENGES BUT FOR THE MOST PART THEY KNEW HE WAS HARMLESS. AND THEY ALL NEWMAN THEY MAY KNOW HOW TO DEAL WITH THE ONLINE SITUATIONS ARISE IN MANY TIMES HE WOULD ACT UP AND THEN QUICKLY DISAPPEAR. SO ANYWAY AND I AM VERY FAMILIAR WITH THE GARDENA POLICE DEPARTMENT AS I STATED I HAVE MANY FRIENDS OVER THE LAST THIRTY YEARS AND I'M A FIRST NAME BASIS WHAT OFFICERS WITH THE GARDENA POLICE DEPARTMENT I'VE KNOWN THE FOR OUR POLICE CHIEF PASSED POLICE CHIEF PERSONALLY STARTING WITH ROB LINES THE FIRST AND ONLY AFRICAN AMERICAN POLICE CHIEF AND OUR DENNIS HASTERT. ED MEDRANO WHO I KNEW AS A ROOKIE OFFICER WHO LEFT IN NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT BECAUSE GUARDINO WAS IN THE BRINK OF BANKRUPTCY AND HE SAW NO FUTURE IN THE LEFT GUARDINO ENJOYING THE WEATHER POLICE DEPARTMENT AND A NIGHT HE TOLD ME HE WAS LEAVING WE BOTH STOOD THERE WERE TEARS IN OUR EYES AND I SAID DON'T LEAVE WE'RE GOING TO TURN THE CITY AROUND BUT HE SAW NO FUTURE IN GARDENA. ONLY FORM TO RETURN BACK A FEW YEARS LATER AND SERVE NOT ONLY AS A POLICE CHIEF BUT AS OUR CITY MANAGERS WILL ANY IS NOW THE CHIEF OF DOJ'S HERE IN SACRAMENTO. WORKING FOR ATTORNEY GENERAL. IN OUR PREVIOUS CHIEF THOMAS. I JOKE ME ALMOST I NEED YOU. STRIPES ALONE. STARS INBAR. AND NOW CURRENT POLICE CHIEF MIKE SAID. SO WHEN I ABOUT SHOOTING I KNEW OUT OF CARE. FOR GARDENA POLICE O. AND SOON AS I THE NAME OF THE OFFICER I KNEW I DID ALONG BECAUSE I STAY. I DON'T KNOW FIRST NAME BASIS WITH GARDENA POLICE OFFICERS FROM. THREE YEARS. AND.ONLY TO FIND OUT THE OFFICER WHO HAD COMMITTED THE CRIME I TRY. FROM ORANGE. AND HE HAD BEEN. IN THREE PREVIOUS SHOOTINGS BEFORE COMING TO THE GARDENA POLICE DEPARTMENT. WHERE STATE OF ONLY ONE OF ONLY FIVE STATES IN THE NATION THAT DOESN'T HAVE A POLICE TO CERTIFICATION PROGRAM. WE DON'T REQUIRE ANY FOLLOW UP AFTER THE INITIALLY RECEIVED THEIR CERTIFICATION ON LIKE OTHER PROFESSIONS WE DON'T EVEN HAVE A PROCESS REQUIRING DEPARTMENTS TO COMPLETE AN INVESTIGATION AFTER AN OFFICER HAVE RESIGNED OR BEEN FIRED DUE TO MISCONDUCT. IN FACT OUR CLIMATE SYSTEM INCENTIVIZES OPTIONS TO LEAVE A DEPARTMENT BEFORE THEY'RE HELD ACCOUNTABLE. FOR THEIR ACTIONS AND MOVED TO A DIFFERENT COMMUNITY WE SEE THIS EVERY DAY. IT IS UNACCEPTABLE IN CALIFORNIA A STATE TO PROVIDE PRIDES ITSELF ON BEING THE FIRST IN A LEADER IN SO MANY AREAS THAT WE ARE SO FAR BEHIND WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT CRIMINAL JUSTICE AND PUBLIC SAFETY. THE BILL CREATES A STATEWIDE PROCESS TO REVOKE CERTIFICATION OF OFFICER AFTER A CONVICTION OF A SERIOUS CRIME OR TERMINATION FROM EMPLOYMENT DUE TO MISCONDUCT. AGAIN AFTER A SERIOUS CRIME OR TERMINATION FOR MISCONDUCT THIS AROUND IN CASE THE BAD OFFICERS THAT EVERY POLICE CHIEF DELIVERY OFFICER I KNOW THEY STATED THEY. WOULD LOVE TO BE ABLE TO GET READY. ADDITIONALLY THIS BILL ALLOW. COMMISSION UP OFFICER STAND AND TRAINING BETTER KNOWN AS POLLS TO INVESTIGATE. GROUNDS FOR MISCONDUCT. WE SHOULD ALSO BE CREATING AN ADVISORY BOARD. WITH THE IMPULSE THAT WOULD MAKE INITIAL RECOMMENDATIONS ON WHETHER POLL SHOULD BE CERTIFIED AN OFFICER. THIS FOR WOULD BE MADE UP OF PRIMARILY OF COMMUNITY MEMBERS INDIVIDUALS APPOINTED BY THE GOVERNOR THE SPEAKER THE SENATE RULES OR EXPERIENCE ON ISSUES RELATED TO POLICE MISCONDUCT. THERE'S CONCERN THAT THIS IS A BIAS TOWARD OFFICERS AND THAT THE PROPOSITION IS NOT SIMILAR TO COMPARE SIMILAR COMPARED TO BOARDS OF OTHER LICENSED PROFESSIONS. THE TRUTH IS THAT THE PUBLIC DOES NOT TRUST LAW ENFORCEMENT TO POLICE THEMSELVES WE'VE SEEN TOO MANY EXAMPLES. FROM MILLIONS OF PROTESTERS ACROSS THIS COUNTRY. WHO HAVE RALLIED BEHIND THE. MOTOR EXECUTION OF GEORGE FLOYD TO THIS PAST SUNDAY SHOOTING- MR BLIGHT. IN WISCONSIN PEOPLE DO NOT TRUST THE POLICE TO DO THIS JOB. THE BOARD DOES NOT HAVE THE FINAL DETERMINATION OF THE CERTIFYING AN OFFICER AND A BILL DOES NOT REMOVE DUE PROCESS FOR AN OFFICER. TO APPEAL THE BOARD'S RECOMMENDATION SOME OTHER LIFE FOR THIS WOULD STOP THE LIE FEE TO THE BE DETERMINED BY THE COMMISSION SHALL NOT X. THE- TO ADMINISTER THIS PROGRAM. THIS BILL ALLOWS THE COMMISSION TO THE FINE BY REGULATION THE SPECIFIC GROUNDS OF SERIOUS MISCONDUCT THAT WOULD BE CONSIDERED FOR DECERTIFICATION. THERE'S THERE IS CONCERN THAT THE GROUNDS OF THE CERTIFICATION ARE TOO BROAD AND WE WOULD TO CERTIFY OFFICERS WHO HAVE COMMITTED A TRY VIOLATION. THIS IS NOT MY INTENT OR THE INTENT OF THIS BILL AT ALL. AND I DO NOT EXPECT COMMISSION COMPOSED MAINLY OF LAW ENFORCEMENT TO ACCESS ENACT SUCH A DEFINITION. THIS BILL ALSO MAKES CHANGES TO THE TOM BAIN CIVIL RIGHTS ACT IT CLARIFIES THE GENERAL INTENT TO INTERFERE WITH A PERSON'S CIVIL RIGHTS INSTINET. IS OF SUFFICIENT TO BRING A SUIT UNDER THE BANNER. IT ENSURES THAT A FAMILY MEMBER OF A PERSON KILLED BY LAW ENFORCEMENT ALSO HAS. ALSO ALSO IS ALSO ABLE TO ASSERT A CALLS OF ACTION. AND FINALLY IT CLARIFIES THAT THREE IMMUNITIES. CALLING ASSERTED BY LAW ENFORCEMENT ARE NOT COMPARABLE TO CLAIMS BROUGHT UNDER THE BAN ACT. THIS IS A VITAL IN TO INCREASE LONG FOR ACCOUNT. AND RESTORE COMMUNITY TRUST IN LAW ENFORCEMENT IT GIVES THEM SOME SKIN IN THE GAME AND I THINK IT MAKES OFFICE WANT TO PER FORM A LITTLE BIT MORE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THOSE BAD ACTORS NOT THE ONES THAT PERFORM AN HONORABLE WAY ON A DAILY BASIS. LASTLY I WANT TO ADDRESS THE CONCERNS THAT WE HAVE NOT ENGAGE WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT. THIS IS COMPLETELY UNTRUE. THE BEST WAY I CAN DESCRIBE IT IS FAKE NEWS. OUR OFFICE IS MADE OURSELVES AVAILABLE TO LAW ENFORCEMENT. AND HAS NEVER REFUSED ANY MEETING. AND I SIT HERE TODAY BEFORE YOU AS A MEMBER OF THIS LEGISLATURE BODY OF ALMOST TEN YEARS. AND I'VE NEVER MISSED A DAY OF WORK I'M ALWAYS AVAILABLE TO ANYONE WHO'S EVER WANTED TO MEET WITH ME. LAFORTUNE HAS BEEN THROUGHOUT THIS PROCESS AND HAVE ENGAGE DIRECTLY WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE ON THE BILL'S LANGUAGE. THIS BILL LARGELY REPRESENTS THE STRUCTURE OF THE GOLDEN FROM THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE WHICH I THINK IS BEEN THANKFUL FOR THEIR INVOLVEMENT FROM BEGINNING. BUT PUSHES FURTHER ON PROVISIONS THAT WE BELIEVE CREATE MORE EFFECTIVENESS WE I'VE ALSO HAD EXTENSIVE CONVERSATIONS WITH. ALL OF YOUR BOOKS HERE ARE TURNING GENERAL WHO SHARED SOME OF HIS CONCERNS AND WAYS TO IMPROVE THIS AS WELL. NOT AGREEING WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT DOES NOT MEAN THAT WE HAVE NOT BEEN ENGAGED WITH THEM. I IT IT'S THAT'S JUST THE POLICY OF WHERE WE ARE TODAY LAW ENFORCEMENT. PASSED PROS ARE ONLY GOES TO ADDRESS SOME OF THEIR CONCERNS. THE PROPOSAL LEAVES ALL INVESTIGATIONS THE LOCAL AGENCIES. IT ONLY ALLOWS THE CERTIFICATION IF AN OFFICER HAS LEFT THE DEPARTMENT. OR HAVE COMMITTED THREE ACTS OF SERIOUS MISCONDUCT IT REMOVED THE CHANGES TO THE BRAIN ACT AND IT MAKES THE ADVISORY BOARD BE COMPOSED OF MOSTLY LAW ENFORCEMENT AND IT REMOVES A LICENSING FEE. L. WAY OF PAYING FOR THIS PROCESS. IT EVEN REMOVES THE ABILITY TO DO NOT TO DECERTIFY OFFICERS WHO WERE FIRED FOR PARTICIPATING IN LAW ENFORCEMENT GAINES MANY OF WHERE WHERE WHILE WE'RE ON AND- KELLY COUNTY SHERIFF'S OF. THAT COME THE JUST RIGHT THERE IN THE TOP IN DEPARTMENT OR I REPRESENT. THREE OF WHOM THERE WERE FAR BY ONLY COUNTY. SHERIFF THE JUST LAST WEEK. MARTIN ONE FOURTEEN SAYS THEY WANTED. THE CERTIFICATION. BUT THEY WANT TO BE LEFT ACCOUNTABLE TO THEMSELVES THIS BILL IS NOT PERFECT BUT IT CREATES A SYSTEM OF AB DE CERTIFICATION A CALIFORNIA'S CAN TRUST. THAT WILL HOLD BACK OFFICES ACCOUNTABLE AGAIN THIS IS ABOUT BAD OFFICERS NOT THE WHO GO TO WORK EVERY DAY AND DO THEIR JOB RESPONSIBILITIES IT'S THE BAD APPLES WHICH WE ALL SHE WANNA GET A WHAT TO READ OUT WE WANT TO GET RID OF BAD POLITICIANS WE DO THAT WOULD RECALL IF WE GET RID OF BAD DOCTORS WE GET RID OF BAD TEACHERS. WE GET RID OF BAD LAWYERS BUT YOU CAN'T GET RID OF BACK OFFICE THIS BILL IS SUPPORTED BY LEGISLATIVE BLOCK OFF THE CAUCUS DOESN'T THE COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS HUNDRED OF ARTISTS AND ENTERTAINERS.

THANK YOU YES PLEASE. MY NAME'S DAVID MISTAKE ME I AM A LABOR ATTORNEY WHO SPECIALIZES IN REPRESENTING PUBLIC EMPLOYEES. I'M APPEARING TODAY ON BEHALF OF MY CLIENT SACRAMENTO COUNTY DEPUTY SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION. MY CLIENT AND I THINK I CAN SPEAK FOR THE GREATER LAW ENFORCEMENT COMMUNITY. I UNDERSTAND THE NEED FOR POLICE REFORM PARTICULARLY AT THIS MOMENT IN OUR NATION'S HISTORY. I ALSO WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT MY CLIENT SUPPORTS A LICENSE REVOKED CATION PROCESS AND TO THAT END WE WORK TIRELESSLY. WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS. TO ESTABLISH A FAIR AND WORKABLE LICENSING SYSTEM. THAT ASSIST IN STRIKING THE PROPER BALANCE THAT ADDRESSES LEGITIMATE CONCERNS OVER BAD OFFICERS AVOIDING ACCOUNTABILITY WHILE MAINTAINING FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF DUE PROCESS AND FAIRNESS AND PROTECTING THE INNOCENT OFFICERS. OUR GOAL IS TO ESTABLISH A SYSTEM WHERE POSTED REVIEWS CASES OF SERIOUS MISCONDUCT. WITH THE POWER TO REVOKE. AND WE BELIEVE THEY SHOULD HAVE THE POWER TO ALSO SUSPEND CERTIFICATION OF BAD OFFICERS. WELL AGAIN PROTECTING THE DUE PROCESS RIGHTS OF THOSE OFFICERS THAT ARE INNOCENT OF ALLEGATIONS. MADE AGAINST THEM AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THAT. IN THIS PROFESSION THERE ARE INHERENT INCENTIVES FOR PEOPLE TO MAKE FALSE COMPLAINTS AGAINST OFFICERS AND THAT'S NOT TO SAY THAT EVERY COMPLAINT OF MISCONDUCT. IS FALSE BUT IF YOU ARE SUBJECT TO A CRIMINAL PROCEEDING OR YOU HAVE A CIVIL PROCEEDING THERE ARE INHERITING SAYS AND THOSE INCENTIVES AREN'T NECESSARILY IN PLACE WITH OTHER PUBLIC EMPLOYEES AND THAT HAS TO BE CONSIDERED IN MY VIEW. OUR GOAL WAS. TO HAVE A SYSTEM WHERE AGENCIES ARE REQUIRED TO COMPLETE INVESTIGATIONS OF SERIOUS MISCONDUCT REGARDLESS OF WHETHER AN OFFICER RESIGNED BEFORE ITS CONCLUSION WE BELIEVE THAT IT'S IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE THAT OFFICERS ARE NOT ABLE TO LEAVE AN AGENCY AND GO TO ANOTHER AGENCY TO AVOID THE CONSEQUENCES OF THEIR ACTIONS WE BELIEVE THAT. BY HAVING A SYSTEM WHERE THE INVESTIGATION MUST BE COMPLETED THAT WOULD ALLOW POST A MORE COMPLETE RECORD IN ORDER TO EVALUATE WHETHER OR NOT THAT OFFICER CERTIFICATION SHOULD BE REVOKED OR SUSPENDED THEY RESIGN AND THERE'S NO INVESTIGATION ON THERE'S NOTHING FOR. POST TO REVIEW AND MAKE THAT DETERMINATION ON WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT AS A MATTER OF DUE PROCESS AND THOROUGHNESS. POST SHOULD DEFER ITS DECISION UNTIL AFTER ANY OTHER ADMINISTRATIVE APPEALS HAVE BEEN COMPLETED AND UNDER OUR PROPOSAL. POST WOULD GET AN IMMEDIATE NOTIFICATION UPON. THE AGENCY SUSTAINING SERIOUS MISCONDUCT. BUT YOU WOULDN'T HAVE COLLATERAL CONCURRENT PROCEEDINGS GOING YOU WOULD ALLOW THEM TO GO SEQUENTIALLY AND IN THAT SITUATION THERE'S NO RISK TO THE PUBLIC BECAUSE THE OFFICERS ALREADY BEING TERMINATED BY OTHER AGENCIES THAT THEY'RE NOT IN A POSITION WHERE THEY CAN OPERATE AND POST HAS THE NOTIFICATION. AND THEN AT THE END OF THAT PROCESS POST WOULD COMPLETE ITS REVIEW IN ITS DETERMINATION AS TO WHETHER OR NOT CERTIFICATION SHOULD BE REVOKED OR SUSPENDED OBVIOUSLY THERE ARE A NUMBER OF OVERLAPPING LEGAL ISSUES AND- SERIOUS CONCERNS ABOUT DOUBLE JEOPARDY AND- W. TO CASE IN THAT REACHED INCOMPATIBLE VISIONS THERE'S ALSO. IN MY VIEW DIFFERENT DETERMINATIONS THAT CAN BE MADE BETWEEN AN EMPLOYING AGENCY AND A LICENSING BODY AND WE SEE THAT IN OTHER PROFESSIONS LIKE LAWYERS WITH THE STATE BAR MEDICAL LICENSING BOARDS NURSES WHERE SOMEBODY MAY ENGAGE IN MISCONDUCT THAT BRINGS SUFFICIENT DISCREDITED THAT AGENCY THAT THEY CAN NO LONGER BE EMPLOYED THERE FOR EXAMPLE AN ATTORNEY WHO MALPRACTICE IS A CASE ON A BIG CLIENT. THAT MAY OR MAY NOT WARRANT RELOCATION OF THEIR ABILITY TO WORK AS AN ATTORNEY AND ENGAGE IN THEIR CHOSEN PROFESSION IF IT'S SOMETHING THAT IS AREAS SUCH AS GOING FROM A QUIET THEN PRESUMABLY THE STATE BAR WOULD PROVOKE THE LICENSE IF IT'S A MISTAKE IT MAY BE SOME LESSER. SOMEONE PUNISHMENT AND THAT IS THE FRAMEWORK. THAT WE HAVE BEEN WORKING TOWARDS AND FRANKLY WERE DISAPPOINTED THAT THE LATEST ITERATION OF THIS BILL SEEM TO MOVE FARTHER APART FROM THAT COMMONALITY IN THOSE PRINCIPLES OF FUNDAMENTAL RULE OF LAW DUE PROCESS AND FAIRNESS. I WANT TO HIT ON SOME OF THE MAJOR CONCERNS THAT WE HAVE WITH THE BILL SIR AS BRITAIN HELLO SIR YES NORMALLY ALLOW THREE MINUTES YOU'RE AT FIVE SO I DO NEED TO ASK YOU TO WRAP UP PLEASE. IF I COULD JUST IT IS REAL QUICK. FOR ONE IS THE COMPOSITION OF THE BOARD THAT MAKES THE THEY RE VOCATION DETERMINATIONS. THEY LACK IMPARTIALITY. AND THEY ALSO LACK ALL BUT THREE OF THE NINE MEMBERS SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTISE IN THESE AREAS GENERALLY WHEN YOU WHEN YOU LOOK AT IMPARTIALITY. I WANT I'M SORRY I REALLY CANNOTLET YOU GO ON IT'S UNFAIR I GIVE PEOPLE THREE MINUTES YOU'RE NOW APPROACHING. SIX I NEED YOU TO WRAP UP A WANNA CUT YOU OFF BUT YOUR EXPLANATION OF EACH OF THESE STEPS IF YOU CAN LIST THEM OKAY BUT AN EXPLANATION IS NOT GOING TO BE WARRANTED AT THIS TIME. OKAY SO WITH REGARDS TO THE BOARD MEMBERS THERE ARE INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE MEMBERS OF ORGANIZATIONS OR THE PEOPLE WHO BELIEVE THEY ARE THE VICTIM OF POLICE VIOLENCE THAT HAVE INHERENT ISSUES WITH LACK OF IMPARTIALITY WITH RESPECT TO THE PROCESS- HAVING TO WILL DETERMINATION THE THIS BILL AS WRITTEN STATE THAT THE BOARD IS NOT EVEN REQUIRED TO FOLLOW DETERMINATIONS OF A COURT OF LAW OR THE COURT OF APPEAL HAS TO ISSUES AND SO YOU CAN HAVE DOUBLE JEOPARDY. AND INCONSISTENT RULINGS THERE IS- VERY LIMITED DISCRETION IS ACTUALLY GIVEN TO THE POST COMMISSION BECAUSE THIS SUB BOARDS DETERMINATION HAVE TO BE ADOPTED IF THEY'RE SUPPORTED ESSENTIALLY BY ANY EVIDENCE AND SO THERE'S NOT AN INDEPENDENT DETERMINATION BY THE POST COMMISSION IS THE MORE LIKELY THAN NOT AND SO WITH HAVING AN UNFAIR PANEL THERE'S AN UNFAIR APPEAL PROCESS THAT WOULD NOT MEET MINIMUM STANDARDS OF DUE PROCESS IN ANY COURT IN AMERICA THAT THAT PANEL MEMBERS OF THE BOARD WOULD NOT MEET THE IMPARTIALITY REQUIREMENTS OF ANY JURY IN AMERICA. AND IN CLOSING WE JUST ASK THE COMMITTEE TO VOTE NO ON THIS SO THAT WE CAN CONTINUE THIS CONVERSATION AND CONTINUE WORKING TOWARDS A LICENSING REGIME THAT ALL PARTIES CAN SUPPORT AND IS IN THE BEST INTEREST OF CALIFORNIA.

QUESTIONS COMMENTS MR OBERNOLTE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I CENTER. IN YOUR OPEN YOU SAID THAT IT WAS NOT YOUR INTENTION THAT- THIS COMMISSION BE USED AS A TOOL TO DECERTIFY OFFICERS FOR ANYTHING LESS THAN SERIOUS OR CRIMINAL ACTIVITY- THERE'S A SECTION OF THE BILL HOWEVER THAT I AM CONCERNED ABOUT AND- IF IT'S IN THE SECTION THAT LISTS THE AXE FOR WHICH A POLICE OFFICER COULD BE DECERTIFIED IT SAYS. IT INCLUDES ACTS THAT VIOLATE THE LAW IN ARE INCONSISTENT WITH THE OFFICER'S OBLIGATION TO UPHOLD THE LAW OR RESPECT THE RIGHTS OF MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC SO YOU MENTIONED TRAFFIC TICKETS IS SOMETHING YOU KNOW RIDICULOUS EXAMPLE OF SOMETHING THAT WOULDN'T BE USED. TO DECERTIFY AN OFFICER BUT IT SEEMS LIKE THAT WOULD BE INCLUDED IN THE SECTION THAT SAYS ACTS THAT VIOLATE THE LAW TO THAT CAN YOU- TELL US ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE THINKING WAS WHEN YOU PUT THAT. I WE WANT A BROAD NET BUT WE'RE GOING TO TRUST. THE BOARD PLUS THIS A POST- REVIEW BOARD TO. DISCERN AND CAN MAKE THAT DECISION THAT. THE BULLS ARE EXAMPLES THAT WE WOULDN'T WANT TO OFFICER TO LOSE HIS HIS OR HER BACK FOR. BY YES BREAKING THE LAW IS A CLEAR VIOLATION OF WHY YOU SHOULD LOSE. THE BE THE CERTIFIED BUT EGREGIOUS ACTS AND THAT'S WHAT THE REVIEW BOARD ALL ABOUT THE HAVE THAT LEVEL OF. EXPERTISE TO COME TO THAT REASONABLE CONCLUSION THAT THIS LAUNCH DECERTIFICATION VERSUS THIS LARGE SUSPENSION THIS WARMS EIGHT RIGHT UP IT. YOU KNOW WHATEVER THE CASE MAY BE A LEAVE WITHOUT PAY. BY IT'S. EIGHT WE WERE TO SPY THE BABY IN A SO WAYS BUT I THANK WE TRIED TO GET THE EXAMPLES OF BOTH VIOLATIONS THAT WOULD NOT ONLY LEAD TO OF BEING TO CERTIFIED IN A TRAFFIC VIOLATION IF YOU FALSIFIED SOMEONE DOING SIXTY FIVE WHEN THEY WERE REALLY DOING FORTY FIVE SHOULD COST YOU YOUR CERTIFICATION OKAY SO I MEAN IF I'M UNDERSTANDING YOU- SOMETHING LIKE A PARKING TICKET WHICH IS AN INFRACTION. WOULD QUALIFY TO BE BROUGHT BEFORE THE BOARD FOR DECERTIFICATION BUT YOU WOULD RELY ON THE BOARD TO SAY NO THAT'S A MINOR VIOLATION AND DOESN'T WARRANTY CERTIFICATION. THE LOCAL AGENCY HAS THE FIRST BITE AT THE APPLE SOLD VERY WOULD DETERMINE IF IN FACT IT REALLY ROSE TO THE LEVEL OF THE CERTIFICATION. THAT'S SOME OF THE THINGS WE WENT BACK AND FORTH ABOUT SO. THE LOCAL AGENCY HAS THE FIRST CALL THROUGH YOUR LOCAL AGENCY IS BRINGING YOU BEFORE. THE CIRCUIT BOARS OFF THE DATE THE TERM IN THAT. IT WAS EGREGIOUS ACTS. BUT WE'RE WE'RE JUST. THOUSAND CAN COME. THAT THAT CAN RESULT IN DECERTIFICATION I'M SORRY WE'RE- IN THIS BILL WE'RE LISTING. THE ACTIVITIES THAT CAN RESULT IN DECERTIFICATION. SO THE WORD COLLUDING IN A FRACTION LIKE A PARKING TICKET NO. WE'RE NOT NO. OKAY SO WHEN IT SAYS ACTS THAT VIOLATE THE LAW WHICH IS EXACTLY DOES THAT MEAN. I MEAN YOU GOT BROWN. I. DEGREES OF VIOLATING THE LAW SO TO CONTINUE TO TRY TO WOULD WOULD DOWN TO SPECIFIC ACTION WE CAN DO THAT WE CAN COME WITH. COME TO AGREEMENT ON JUST THE- WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE MOST EGREGIOUS ACTS FALSIFYING EVIDENCE. ALL EXCESSIVE USES OF FORCE. KILLING EIGHT INDIVIDUALS SEXUAL ASSAULT ALL THOSE EXAMPLES THAT WE'VE SEEN ON A REGULAR BASIS THAT HAS LED TO SOMEONE BEING FIRED OR RESIGNING AND TRANSFERRING TO ANOTHER APARTMENT FALSIFYING A SPEEDING TICKET OR A PARKING TICKET HAS NEVER LED TO ANYONE. BEING FIRED A BRAVE AND SUSPENDED OKAY I DON'T WANT TO GET INTO COLLEGE WE SENATOR BUT- BUT- I'M NOT I'M SORRY I'M SORRY I'M SORRY FOR THOSE ON THE PHONE. YOU'RE YOU'RE THERE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS IF CALLED UPON. ZERO ONE TO GO AHEAD PLEASE SO. THE FRUSTRATION HERE IS- THAT WE HAVE OTHER SECTIONS OF THE BILL THAT REFER TO SERIOUS CRIMES FELONIES THAT WOULD RESULT IN DECERTIFICATION AND THIS IS JUST KIND OF ANOTHER SECTION THAT SAYS- ANY VIOLATION OF THE LAW AND IN IT I'M ALSO CONCERNED BECAUSE IT SAYS LAW IT DOES NOT SAY. A CRIME COMMISSION OF A CRIME IT'S A VIOLATION OF THE LAW WHICH COULD BE EXTENDED TO SOMETHING STATUTORY. I MEAN A UNIFORM VIOLATION THAT'S A VIOLATION OF SOMETHING THAT'S IN STATE STATUTE THAT THAT COULD BE A VIOLATION OF THE LAW AND SO ON IS THAT THESE THIS IS A SERIOUS. THE SERVICE TOPIC AND I THINK WE REALLY NEED TO. TOTAL DOWN ON THE SPECIFICITY OF EXACTLY WHAT WHAT ARE THE ACTS THAT. WE'RE GOING TO HOLD POLICE OFFICERS ACCOUNTABLE FOR I AND IF I IF I COULD IF THE OPPOSITION'S ONLINE- MAYBE THEY CAN OPINE ON WHETHER OR NOT. THIS PARTICULAR SECTION I IS PROBLEMATIC BECAUSE I FEEL IT IS. MISERABLE IF YOU HAVE A SPECIFIC QUESTION FOR A WITNESS PLEASE. ASK THAT'S RIGHT BUT I'M NOT GONNA OPEN IT UP FOR ADDITIONAL TESTS SO HERE'S MY QUESTION. TO THE OPPOSITION WITNESS- IS THAT PARTICULAR SECTION I'M CITED THAT SAYS I ACTUALLY VIOLATE THE LAW COULD DO THAT- LEAD TO SOMETHING LIKE A PARKING TICKET BEING USED. TO CERTIFY DECERTIFY OFFICERS. THIS IS DAVID MISTAKE NAY OUT TO. THAT WILL. ONE OF THE CONCERNS. J. WILL THE RATE IF I HAD MORE TIME. GET YOU APTLY POINTED OUT THERE'S ALREADY A REQUIREMENT FOR DECERTIFICATION IF AN OFFICER COMMITS A FELONY SO IF WE'RE EXPANDING THAT OTHER VIOLATIONS OF THE LAW NECESSARILY IS TALKING ABOUT MORE MINOR VIOLATIONS ALL THE WAY DWN TO INFRACTIONS OR AS YOU POINTED OUT. VIOLATIONS OF NON CRIMINAL STATUTES OKAY. SENATOR AYE AYE I THINK THAT YOUR- YOU'RE DOING GOOD WORK IN BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD AND I AM EXTREMELY FRUSTRATED I APOLOGIZE WHAT WHAT THAT PROSTRATION CHAU I'M FRUSTRATED BECAUSE I PERSONALLY AGREE WITH YOU. THAT WE SHOULD HAVE THE CERTIFICATION PROCESS IN CALIFORNIA I AGREE WITH YOU THAT POLICE OFFICER SHOULD BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR ACTIONS AND I THINK MOST POLICE OFFICERS WOULD AGREE. THAT IT HELPS THEM IF WE ESTABLISH LAWS THAT PREVENT BAD OFFICERS FROM MOVING FROM DEPARTMENT TO DEPARTMENT TO DEPARTMENT BUT UNFORTUNATELY THE WAY THIS BILL IS WRITTEN. IT'S WRITTEN IN SUCH A WAY THAT IT'S VERY DIFFICULT FOR ANYONE THAT CARES ABOUT POLICE OFFICERS TO VOTE FOR IT AND THAT'S WHY I'M SO FRUSTRATED I FIND IT HARD BREAKING IT AND SO I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU SHOULD JUST GO MOVE FORWARD TO TAKE A LOOK AT THAT SECTION WHICH IS THE PARTICULARLY PROBLEMATIC SECTION. OF THE BILL AND PERHAPS FIVE DEFINE WAS MORE SPECIFICITY EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AND I DON'T EVEN THINK THAT THAT PARTICULAR- SENTENCE NEEDS TO BE IN THERE BECAUSE ELSEWHERE IN THE BILL WE'RE ALREADY TALKING ABOUT WHAT CRIMES APPLY. COOLEY NOTE. THANK YOU BECAUSE I. SAN RECORD. I HAVE THE CHAIR WILL ALLOW ME SOME LETTERS OF A NUMBER OF QUESTION. I AM WE HAVE NO PLANS TO IF THEY SHOULD PASS TODAY TO PAY INTO PRO. SO I DO WANT TO START WITH LETTING YOU KNOW THAT WE ARE DOING A FISCAL AND ALSO ON IT THAT WILL BE ATTACHED TO FOR SESSION. THE FLOOR DOCUMENTARY SUPPOSE- BECAUSE IT IS A VERY EXPENSIVE BILL AND I THINK WE'RE TRYING TO GET THROUGH EXACTLY HOW MUCH. OF START WITH THAT. THE BEAN ACT SECTION- SOME QUESTION JUST SOME SIMPLE QUESTIONS I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND BECAUSE- THE DIFFERENT SECTIONS THAT YOUR- AMENDING SECTIONS EIGHTY TWO POINT SIX AND A HALF. **** OUT EIGHTY FOUR EIGHT EIGHT TWO ONE POINT SIX EIGHT FOUR FOUR POINT SIX EIGHT FOUR FIVE POINT SIX. THEY DON'T GET TO. THE CALL FOR IT IF THEY DON'T GET TO EXCESSIVE FORCE QUESTION WAS TOLD BY THE ACLU THAT WE DON'T NEED TO BECAUSE THAT'S ALREADY THE LAW THAT WONDERING WHY THOSE THEN. ARE BEING PLACED INTO THIS BILL. I THINK MISTER BLUEPRINT WAS GONNA ANSWER THE TECHNICAL QUESTIONS AS IT RELATES TO THE SPECIFIC SPECIFIC AREAS OF THE BRAIN ACT IF I'M NOT CORRECT IS THAT OKAY MISTER CHAIRMAN. YES THAT'S OKAY THIS B. RING CONSIDER THAT QUESTION ASKED OF YOU. ARE YOU ALIVE. APOLOGIES APOLLO YES THE POLITICIANS EFFECT THE- COMMITTEE WHO MAY NOT OKAY MISS YOU. ARE YOU ON THE LINE. YES GOOD MORNING I WANTED TO IT THAT QUESTION ABOUT THE IMMEDIATE WHY THREE AND NOT ANY ME BE COVERING DOCTORS OUT THE SPENDING ABOUT THE J. AND THAT BECAUSE THE CALIFORNIA LAW I'VE NEVER GRANTED IMMUNITY GOVERNMENTAL IMMUNITY A POLICE OFFICER YOU THINK EXCEPT THE PORK OUTSIDE THE JAIL PENDING. THEREFORE THERE WOULD NO NEED TO THAT IN THE NOT BE THEY DIDN'T. GET EXTRA BIT DEGREE IN THE THAT WE ARE. ADDRESS THAT THE WE I'D BE OF WOULD THREE IMMUNITY IN PARTICULAR CAR GET AND DID. IN PEOPLE OF COLOR AND ARE MORE BOMB MEN OF THE INCLUDING WITH WITH MENTAL R LIMITING. SO I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WANT ME TO GO OVER EACH OF THE BILL WITH AND SEPARATE IMMUNITY THAT THE MOMENT OR WAIT FOR A SEPARATE QUESTION NO THAT'S THE WAY FOR SEPARATE BUT MORE SPECIFIC QUESTIONS IT WOULD BE HELPFUL- MISTER BRADFORD IF GIVEN THE ASSERTION THAT THOSE DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECT PEOPLE OF COLOR TO HAVE SOME- FACTUAL BACKGROUND WITHOUT SOME STATISTICS OF SOME SORT BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY. THE PROBABLY THINGS WERE NOT INCLUDING THAT AND THAT PROPORTIONALLY AFFECT PEOPLE OF COLOR- YOU KNOW PUTTING PEOPLE. IN JAIL. AND THE ITSELF. FACT PEOPLE COLOR BUT IT J. IT I SPENT A LONG TIME ON THIS SECTION AND IT SEEM TO FIT WITH EVERYTHING I WE'RE DOING AND I HAD A LOT OF QUESTIONS ON WHY WE CHOSE THESE THREE AND WHAT WE'RE DOING MOVING FORWARD. WITH THAT TO THE D. CERTIFICATE THIS CERTIFICATION DECERTIFICATION A COUPLE QUESTIONS THAT I JUST WISH WE HAVE THE TIME TO KIND. I I'M NOT SURE I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND FOR PEACE OFFICER ELIGIBLE THERE'S A P. ABOUT. ABOUT FELONIES. CRIMES COMMITTED THE MILITARY WHO WHO'S GOING TO DETERMINE WHETHER CRIME COMMITTED THE MILITARY CONSTITUTES A FELONY. IN CALIFORNIA WOULD BE POST WILL HAVE ACCESS TO THE APPLICANT'S MILITARY FILE HOW THE WILL THAT BE DETERMINED BECAUSE IT'S NOT AS IF IT'S- EQUITABLE TO WHAT I CALIFORNIA FELONY. I'M SORRY. THIS IS FOR PEACE OFFICER ELIGIBILITY OKAY AND WHO CONDUCTS INVESTIGATION WILL BE POST IT WILL BE UP POLLS WOULD. MAKE THOSE DETERMINATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS ON. SO SOMEBODY COMMITTED A CRIME IN THE MILITARY OF ANY SORT AND TO DETERMINE WHETHER IT WOULD BE A FELONY UNDER CALIFORNIA LAW. POST WOULD MAKE IT WOULD REVIEW THEIR MILITARY FILE I REALLY AM CONFUSED AS TO WHY WE WOULD BE LOOKING AT SOMEONE'S MILITARY CONTACT ONCE THEY WERE ALREADY HIRED BY POLICE DEPARTMENT THAT'S THE PROBLEM I I'M I'M CONFUSED AS WELL SO. I THINK BECAUSE SCHEME THE ELIGIBILITY TO BECOME A POLICE OFFICER THE INITIAL ELIGIBILITY TO BE CERTIFIED INCOME POLICE OFFICER NOW DOESN'T ALLOW. YOU TO DO SO IF YOU'VE COMMITTED A CALIFORNIA FELONY AND YET IT ALSO SAYSIN THE MILITARY SO I THINK THAT'S AN UNANSWERED QUESTION THESE ARE THINGS WE'RE JUST GOING TO HAVE TO CONTINUE TO LOOK AT. ONE THAT. JUST BUT- AGAIN THEN YOU'RE SPEAKING OF CONTACT THAT I WOULD SAY WAS UNBECOMING OF OFFICERS SO THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN. VETTED OUT BEFORE BEING HIRED SO TO CUT LOOK BACK RETROSPECTIVELY WITHOUT THIS CONDUCT. I THINK THAT'S THE BILL THAT MISS BURKE IS CARRYING RIGHT NOW THAT. DOES. A YEAR- BEFORE BEING HIRED BY OFFICERS BUT YOUR BILL DEALS WITH. IN THE FUTURE AND ELIGIBILITY FOR SOMEBODY TO BECOME TO BE CERTIFIED AS AN OFFICER IN CALIFORNIA AND SO IN THE FUTURE. HOW WILL THEY DEAL WITH CRIMES. THAT AN INDIVIDUAL MAY HAVE COMMITTED IN THE MILITARY BECAUSE IT REFERENCES THAT AND YET IT DOESN'T. THERE HAS TO BE SOME DETERMINATION WHETHER THAT CRIME IS A CALIFORNIA FELONY PREVENTING THEM FROM BECOMING ELIGIBLE TO BECOME A PEACE OFFICER. OR IF IT WAS NOT IT'S JUST IT'S JUST. IN A IN A IN A WOULD BE EIGHT WE WOULD USE THE LANDS OF CALIFORNIA AND DETERMINING IF THAT WOULD DISQUALIFY INDIVIDUALS THERE WAS SOMETHING. IN THE MILITARY AND IT IS NOT A FALLING IN CALIFORNIA THAT WOULD PROVE. TO PREVENT THAT PERSON FROM BECOMING SUBSEQUENTLY IS GONNA BE THE POST THE- POSTER AFTER THE POST THIS BOARD IS WHO'S GONNA. INTERNET PUT MAKE THAT DETERMINATION. POST A POST OKAY. OKAY I JUST QUESTIONS I HAVE ABOUT SOME THINGS THAT I WORRY AREN'T LINING UP- FOR MY READING OF THE BILL IT SEEMS AS IF A MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC CAN FILE A COMPLAINT WITH THE DIVISION FOR INVESTIGATION IS THAT CORRECT YES OKAY SO. BASED ON THE PUBLIC COMPLAINT THE PEACE OFFICER COULD BE TO CERTIFIED IF THE BOARD IMPOSED AGREE. RIGHT THE THAT MEANS THE PEACE OFFICER DOESN'T HAVE TO BE TERMINATED FROM THEIR AGENCY IN ORDER BE DECERTIFIED. BY THE COMMISSION. AGENCY CRACKED BECAUSE A PLAY IF THEY IF EITHER THEIR AGENCY HAS NOT TERMINATED THEM OR SOMEBODY WENT DIRECTLY TO THE BOARD- THEY COULD STILL ACTUALLY BE. NOT TERMINATED BY THEIR AGENCY CORRECT. SO THEN THE OFFICER STATUTORY PULL OUR RIGHTS WHAT HAPPENS TO THOSE OF THIS HAPPENS. IT'S YEAH I THINK IT'S A BLIND STILL TODAY WHETHER THIS BILL EXISTED EVOKES SYSTEM FOLLOW THE COMPLAINT ABOUT SOME. EGREGIOUS ACT BY A LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER IN ITS INVESTIGATIVE PRIOR TO THEM BEING DETERMINATIVE OF TERM TERMINATED OR DISCIPLINED IN ANY KIND OF WHITE. DOT PROCESS STEEL EXIST TODAY SO. IF AFTER DETERMINING THAT THAT OFFICER WAS BEING FIRED THE SAME PROCESS WOULD FOLLOW THAT PERSON WOULD BE DE CERTIFIED STATE OF BEING FIRED THEY'RE THEY'RE THEY'RE ENTITLED TO BE DECERTIFIED. AS A POLICE OFFICER IF THEY VIOLATED BOWLS LAWS AND THEY WERE FOUND GUILTY BY THE INDEPENDENT REVIEW BOARD IF THEY WANT TO MANY BY THEIR AGENCY THEY STILL MAINTAIN THEIR POSTCARDS. THE RIGHT YES IF THEY HAVEN'T BEEN A FIRE CHEN JUST THINGS MIGHT BE INCLINED AND I'M SUGGEST THAT THESE ARE THINGS THAT I THINK WE HAVE TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON IN ORDER FOR THIS TO BECAUSE WE HAVE EXISTING. THAT THAT OFFICER HAS EXISTING RIGHTS AND IF THEY HAVE BEEN TERMINATED WE'RE NOT TRYING TO BRIDGE THOSE EXISTING RIGHT. NOW AND I IN I APPRECIATE THAT I DON'T HAVE MUCH BIGGER BILL BUT THESE ARE STILL NOT CONFLICTS THAT WILL EXIST. IF YOUR BILL PASSES THAT I THINK WE HAVE TO. DEAL WITH BECAUSE- YES THEY STILL HAVEN'T THIS RIGHT IF THEY'RE NOT TERMINATED THE REGION. SO WE THAT. THAT DURING THIS OF THIS GAME THROUGH MY IN THE GO POLICE A BILL OF RIGHTS ONE OF THOSE THAT PEOPLE TO EXPAND BARBIE WHAT WE HAVE HERE AND WE WILL BE DOWN BECAUSE OF JUST SOME OF THOSE QUESTIONS AND CONCERNS THAT WE'RE HAVING RIGHT HERE AND WE WANT TO RESPECT AND MAINTAIN. AS MUCH INTEGRITY TO THE PROCESS OF PROTECTING BILLS GOOD OFFICERS THIS IS NOT ABOUT A DOCTOR ABOUT ALL POLICE ALSO THIS IS DRILLING DOWN AND GETTING THOSE BACK OFFS IS THAT WE ALL KNOW WE EXIST I TOTALLY AGREE I'M JUST SUGGESTING THAT IF YOU HAVE AN AGENCY THAT DOESN'T THINK THAT THE VIOLATION- THE PRICES TO LEVEL OF TERMINATION. THE NOT OFFICER STILL UNDER CALIFORNIA LAW RETAIN IT AND UNLESS I'M READING THIS WRONG RETAINS ARE POLARIZED AND YET WE JUST CERTIFY THEM SO THERE'S GONNA BE CONFLICT IN LABOR LAW- THAT NEEDS TO SOMEHOW WE NEED TO FIX I'M SORRY FOR THE FUTURE. I'M ANOTHER QUESTION THAT WASN'T ANSWERED THIS WHO WHO PAYS THE COST FOR CERTIFICATION AND CONTINUED ELIGIBILITY SO IT'S GOING TO BE WHAT TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS IF WE HAVE THE TERMINOLOGY I MEAN OF THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE HAD A FEE THE AG'S OFFICE HAD A FEATURE WE'RE SEEN WILL ASSESS WHEN THE OFFICER RENEWS EVERY YEAR WHATEVER THAT AMOUNT IS TO. COVER THE COST AT FIRST THE GOVERNOR TO JUST AS THEY HAD- ON THE MONEY TO STAND THIS THING UP INITIALLY BUT WE MOVED AWAY FROM THAT SO YOU KNOW WE SETTLED ON THE FATE. SO BUT ACTUALLY THAT THE BOSSES THEMSELVES THEY'RE GONNA PAY THAT WHEN. THEY REGISTER. OKAY SO THE OFFICER. OKAY WHEN THEY SURVIVE I'M SURE THIS WILL GIVE SUBJECT OF FUTURE. NEGOTIATIONS WITH. YEAH OKAY SO THE OFFICER BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE INITIAL SORT OF A- COSTS IN EACH EVERY TWO YEARS. ANOTHER REASON. THINGS THAT WE CAN ASSIST. HELP STANNIS SURE WELL I JUST I WANT TO KNOW THIS IS GOING TO WORK I. LOOK I MIGHT WELL SAY MY NOW I THIS SOUNDS I'M VOTE FOR THIS UNDER YOU KNOW I THINK WE NEED TO DO SOME I THINK IT'S DESPERATE I DON'T LIE. HAVING ONE COMMITTEE HOW THESE. NOT BEING ABLE TO PASS THE DEADLINE TO BE ABLE TO. CHANGE ANYTHING TO GET THESE QUESTIONS ANSWERED I WOULD REALLY SUGGEST YOU START THINKING OF A VERY THOROUGH LETTER TO THE JOURNAL OF THE SHOULD PASS SO THESE QUESTIONS AT LEAST OUR ANSWER ON TEMPORARY BASIS TO YOU CAN COME BACK AND FIX THEM I JUST THINK THERE'S A LOT HERE THAT'S- IT MAYBE I'M- BEING GENETIC BECAUSE THIS IS WHAT I WOULD DO. TO YOU IF IT WAS AN APPROPRIATIONS RIGHT NOW WE HAVE THIS CONVERSATION APARTMENTS I'M SORRY- DOES IT. REALLY DOES THE BILL REQUIRE POSTED TRAIN OFFICERS. ABOUT THE DECERTIFICATION PROCESS ARE WE CRAZY ARE ARE WE ALSO GOING TO HAVE IMPOSED THAT WHEN. WHEN OFFICERS DO THE POSTING THEY'RE GONNA LEARN ABOUT DECERTIFICATION. WE HAVEN'T DRILLED DOWN THAT FAR BUT I THINK THAT WOULD BE. A SOMETHING THAT YOU WOULD WANT TO LEARN ABOUT WHILE YOU'RE IN IT. ACADEMY THOSE VIOLATIONS THAT WOULD LEAD TO DECERTIFICATION SO I THINK IF. AGENCIES ARE REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT DOING THE RIGHT THING THEY WOULD HAVE SOME SECTION IN. TRAINING THAT WOULD PROVIDE THAT. AND THEN MY LAST QUESTION HAS TO DO IT IT'S IT IN I ACTUALLY THINK. I HOPE THE ANSWER IS WE'LL FIGURE THIS OUT BUT IF. IT IS GOING TO GO TO THE COSTS OF IT. THE INITIAL CERTIFICATION- WELL FOR CURRENT PEACE OFFICERS RIGHT I WILL POST REVIEW ALL CURRENT DISCIPLINARY RECORDS TO DETERMINE- A DECERTIFICATION FOR EXISTING PEACE OFFICERS LIKE IF A PEACE OFFICERS PREVIOUSLY TERMINATES HIRED BY ANOTHER AGENCY TWO YEARS AGO THEORETICALLY THAT PIECE OFFICER COULD NOW BE FACED WITH DECERTIFICATION. ULTIMATELY UNEMPLOYMENT IT. ARE THEY BEING GRANT IN ON WELL THERE AND I NOT SAYING THAT THAT'S LIKE THAT MAY WHAT WE TO IN FACT SERVICE A RECORD. WELL THEY GO THROUGH THAT SORT. PROCESS IS POSTPONED TO REACH BACK AND- POSSIBLY DECERTIFY SOME EXISTING. POLICE OFFICERS WE HAVEN'T DRILLED DOWN THAT FAR SO WE CAN. OKAY I'M OF THE BILL LIKE I SAID I'M VOTING FOR THIS BILL I JUST THINK WE HAVE- FEEL CONCERNED. FOR CONCERNED THANK YOU THANK YOU WE DO HAVE A MOTION THAT WAS JUST MADE IS THEIR SECOND. WE DO HAVE A SECOND RESURGENT HERE WHAT IS THE MOTION IS IT DO PASSED MOTIONS TO PASS SHOULD TO APPROPRIATIONS NESS THE MOTION IS TO PASS. WHICH IS WHY WOULD I WOULD JUST POINT OF ORDER I WOULD. TO THE CHAIR- AS APPROPRIATIONS CHAIR JUST SAID THIS IS A VERY EXPENSIVE ABILITY EXCEEDS THE THRESHOLD. AND IS REQUIRED TO GO TO APPROPRIATIONS SOLIDS POSTED THAT THE MOTION IS NOT PROPER. IT HAS TO THE MOST THE MOTION HAS TO BE. FOR THE BILL TO GO TO APPROPRIATIONS THE MOTION WAS WE HAVE TO SUSPEND THE RULES MOTION JUST MADE IS TO PASS. WHICH YOU KNOW IS THERE A SUSPENSION OF THE RULES THERE'S NO NEED FOR THERE'S NO NEED FOR ASSISTANCE. BUT I WOULD ASK STUDENTS NEEDS TO BE SOME PARLIAMENT PRESENT THE PARLIAMENTARIAN OR SOMEONE NEEDS TO CLARIFY THIS BECAUSE I THINK THAT IS A PROBLEM. WITH YOUR YOU'RE WELCOME TO AND I. BUT WELL IT COULD SO IS THERE. CAN WE GET THE PARLIAMENTARIAN INCOME THEN THE RULES THAT YOU'VE CLERK BECAUSE MOTIONS TO PASS THERE'S BEEN A MOTION TO THE MAID. AN EMOTION TO THE SECOND AND I'M MAKING A POINT OF ORDER SAYING IT IS NOT CONSISTENT WITH OUR RULES AND I'M MAKING. A RULING THAT IT IS. AND THEN I APPEALED RULING. OKAY THERE'S A APPEAL OF MY- RULING WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A VOTE. ON THAT- ARE AND- THE RULING OF THE MOTION OF THE CHAIR THAT THIS IS AN APPROPRIATE. MOTION FOR US AT THIS POINT. CALL THE ROLL ON THAT I'M ASKING FOR. WE'RE WE'RE VOTING ON THE POINT OF ORDER ON THE RULING OF THE CHAIR THAT THIS IS AN APPROPRIATE MOTION. SO I'M- I'M ASKING FOR SUPPORT SO AND I VOTE IS SUPPORTING THE RULING OF THE CHAIR AND NO VOTE IS OPPOSING THE RULING OF THE CHAIR KALRA PLEASE STAND AYE STONE AYE GALLAGHER. GALLAGHER NO CHILD SHALL I. TWO IVE TWO FIVE THE DALLAS FIVE DOLLARS HOLDEN HOLDEN I KALRA ALL RIGHT I KILEY NO NO MAIENSCHEIN. OBERNOLTE OBERNOLTE NO REYES REYES AYE. THANK YOU SO THE RULING OF THE CHAIR HOW BEEN OPPOSE WE WILL CONTINUE MISTER CHIP I CAN CHAIRMAN FOR THING THE AUTHOR FOR ON SUCH AND TOP AND I KNOW THIS IS PUBLIC HAVE TO I'VE HAD TO GO THROUGH THE ANALYSIS HADN'T HAD MEETINGS WITH BALSA ON THIS AND TRYING TO GET TO A LONG JUST A COUPLE CLARIFY QUESTIONS OR CALL FROM BEAR. WANTED THE LANGUAGE THAT SUGGESTS IS TO THINK THE OP. THAT TRAFFIC FILE. OR MORE MONEY VIOLENCE COULD. IN THE- LOOKING AT THIS- UP SIX LANGUAGE. BUT I JUST WANNA. AS I READ THIS STATUTE IS PUTTING IN CONTEXT. IT SEEMS TO ME- THE BEGINNING OF THAT SECTION SAYS THAT ITS POSTED HAS. THE TASK OF PASSING THESE REGULATIONS SO THEY'RE THE ONES WHO DECIDE RIGHT. AND POST IS MADE UP OF LAW ENFORCEMENT. SO WE'RE LEAVING IT UP TO LAW ENFORCEMENT TO DECIDE EXACTLY WHICH OF THESE. VIOLATIONS WOULD COUNT WHAT I DID.OKAY THAT OBVIOUSLY GIVES ME I THINK MUCH MORE SALAS IF IT WERE. NOT FOR SOME FOLKS I THINK IT WOULD BE A CREDIBLE. DISCUSSION BUT IN THIS PART IN THIS CASE IT'S- IT'S A BIT DIFFERENT- I KNOW WE RECEIVED OF OFFICES LETTERS DESCRIBE THIS BILL I A CO ON. ATTACK AND ACTUALLY WOULD BE TO HEAR FROM. THE OPPOSITION GIVEN OUR STATE. IS NOW ONE OF ONLY FIVE STATES THAT DOESN'T HAVE A SYSTEM FOR OFFICER DECERTIFICATION. SO THIS BILL IS BASICALLY ASK US TO DO FORTY FIVE OTHER STATES. OPEN SOME CAN ARTICULATE HOW THIS BILL IS MAJORLY DIFFERENT FROM OTHER BILLS BECAUSE MY UNDERSTANDING IS. IN A LOT OF OTHERS YOU KNOW THEIR THEIR NUMBER. IN HAVE BILLS. THAT ARE JUST AS STRONG AS WE WE'RE DOING HERE. SILO TO JUST HEAR THAN UNDERSTAND FROM HAPPY TO HEAR FROM. THE OFF AS WELL FROM OPPOSITION MISTER YOUR YOU ON THE LINE STILL THOSE REQUESTS DIRECTED AT. THANK YOU I. NOT A TERM THAT I. BUT I COULDN'T. WHAT THE CONCERNS ARE. GOING BACK TO MEMBER GONZALEZ'S CONCERNS ABOUT PEEL B. R. FOR LINE. HE'LL BE OUR DOESN'T APPLY TO POST IT APPLIES TO THE EMPLOYING AGENCY SO IS IT IN THE SENSE THAT QUESTION WAS THE QUESTION WAS WHAT'S DIFFERENT ABOUT THIS BILL VERSUS THE OTHER STATES THAT HAVE SIMILAR. SIMILAR BILLS TORRANCE. WHEN I WAS TRYING TO GET IT ALL GET THERE FASTER IS THAT THERE IS NOT DUE PROCESS THAT SUPPLIED THAT THE POPE ARE DUE PROCESS AND THE FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT DUE PROCESS UNDER SKELLY IS APPLIED AGAINST THE EMPLOYMENT AGENCY THERE'S REALLY NINE UNDER HERE JUST FOR ONE THIS BOARD IS THE SUBCOMMITTEE OPPOSE. THE OFFICER- ONLY GETS WITH TIME TO REVIEW IT'S NOT DEFINED IN THERE BUT IT SEEMS TO BE BASICALLY AN OPPORTUNITY TO RESPOND. AND JACK BUT NOT TO CALL WITNESSES OR PRESENT EVIDENCE OR HAVE A DETERMINATION THE POST BOARD IS THEN BOUND BY THE DETERMINATION I MEAN SHE'S IN THE POST COMMISSION. IS DOWN BY THE DETERMINATION OF THIS SUB BOARD AND UNDER THE STATUTE SAID THE SHALL ADOPT THE BOARD'S RECOMMENDED IN ELECTED IS WITHOUT A REASONABLE BASIS. ORDINARILY WHEN A LICENSE REVOKED CATION OR CERTIFICATION REVOCATION HEARING IS HELD IT HELD AT A HIGHER STANDARD BECAUSE IT'S NOT JUST THE PERSON LOSING A JOB IT'S THE MAN OR WOMAN LOSING THEIR ABILITY TO EARN. A LIVING IN THEIR CHOSEN OCCUPATION SO IT'S USUALLY A CLEAR AND CONVINCING STANDARD THIS IS. STANDARD WHEREBY BASICALLY THIS SUBCOMMITTEE AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE DEFINITIONS- SPOKES ON THERE THAT ARE GOING TO HAVE CLEAR BIASES AND LACK OF IMPARTIALITY. THEY MAKE A DETERMINATION THERE IS A DE MINIMUS REVIEW IT'S ONLY UNDER THE STATUTES NOT UNDER PO BR. AND THEN THE POST COMMISSION IS BOUND TO UPHOLD IT. ELECTED IS DOESN'T SATISFY RATIONAL REVIEW STANDARD WHICH IS A VERY HIGH. BAR IN THE POLE BARN IS NOT INCORPORATED INTO THIS BILL ALSO THERE'S NO POPEIL BE OUR STYLE RIGHT TO THE MINISTRY OF APPEAL HEARING. OF THAT DETERMINATION WHERE YOU HAVE FAIR STANDARDS IN A FAIR HEARING BOARD- I MEAN THERE'S A NUMBER OF OTHER ISSUES BUT THAT IS ONE OF THAT THAT MAJOR CONCERNS AND I PRESUME IS- WHAT ELICITED THOSE COMMENTS. SILVA CANNOT EVEN RESTATE THE QUESTION TO THE AUTHOR SO MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT AGAIN THERE FORTY FIVE OTHER STATES THAT HAVE LAWS ON THE BOOKS. MANY OF THEM HAVE ACTUALLY VERY STRONG LAWS SO I'VE BEEN TOLD GEORGIA FLORIDA HAVE SOME OF THE STRONGEST DECERTIFICATION RULES AND COUNTRY- I'M REALLY JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND HOW WHAT YOU'RE PROPOSING HERE COMPARES TO THAT BECAUSE I THINK WE CAN. WE CAN ARGUE ALL DAY ABOUT. WHAT IS IN THIS VIS A VIS CAL A LOT BUT I'M TRYING TO GET US OF HOW COMPARED TO OTHER STATES AND- I HAVE TO ADMIT I WAS SHOCKED WHEN. I LEARNED THAT WERE ONE OF FIVE THAT NOT HAVE SO ON WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING. YES THE OTHER STATES TO DO. HAVE THE CERTIFICATION OR WHY MASSACHUSETTS NEW JERSEY AND RHODE ISLAND WE'RE THE FIFTH THAT DOESN'T HAVE IT. AND WE MODEL. OUR BUILT AFTER GEORGIA AND- GEORGIA IN FLORIDA PROBABLY HAS THE STRICTEST- THE CERTIFICATION GUIDELINES THEY HAVE DECERTIFIED- 40% OF ALL THOSE OFFICERS WHO HAVE BEEN DECERTIFIED- ACROSS THE COUNTRY. FLORIDA HAS. A MAJOR JUST DONE THE MAJORITY OF THAT. AND BUT AGAIN. IT'S A- PROCESS THAT HAS NOT CREATED ANY KIND OF PEOPLE. IN GEORGIA OR IN FLORIDA IT IS WORKING WELL THE SHEET TO SCROLL. UP AROUND CREATING THOSE BAD OFFICERS AND SUSTAINING AND MAINTAINING. THE GOOD OFFICERS AND- BIT. THE POLICE DEPARTMENTS THAT WE ALL KNOW WE NEED IN OUR COMMUNITIES. SO THAT'S THE GUIDELINES THAT WE WE'VE- TRIED TO. MODELED AFTER A- AND SERVE. CAN BE RIVER WITHOUT REGARD TO. OF SPENCER CRIME SHOWED A PEACE OFFICER CASE COULD BE RESOLVED WITHOUT. RUTAN'S A CONVICTION OF CERTAIN CRIMES THAT'S WHAT WAS IN THE GEORGIA LAW AND THAT'S WHAT WE PUT IN OURS AS WELL SO. GREAT THANK YOU JUST MAKE A COUPLE COMMENTS ON MY PERSPECTIVE HERE AND I WANT TO IMPART RESPOND TO OUR COLLEAGUE FROM BIG BEAR SUGGESTION THAT. ANYONE WHO CARES ABOUT POLICE OFFICERS CAN'T SUPPORT THIS BILL BECAUSE I WOULD SUSPECT. THAT EVERY MEMBER OF THIS COMMITTEE WANTS TO SEE. THE RESPECT OF LAW ENFORCEMENT IMPROVE. AND AS SOMEONE WHO USED TO BE PART OF LAW ENFORCEMENT AS A FORMER PROSECUTOR THAT'S CERTAINLY MY PERSPECTIVE AND- I WOULD SAY THE REALLY SORT OF TWO REASONS WHY I'M ON I WILL BE VOTING FOR THIS BILL TODAY. FIRST HAS TO DO WITH THE FACT THAT WE ARE ONE OF FIVE STATES THAT HAS NOT SET UP A PROCESS AND- I THINK THAT'S FRANKLY EMBARRASSING MISTAKEN ALSO ON TO DO THAT. AND WE'RE HEARING FROM OUR CONSTITUENTS. LOUDLY AND CLEARLY THAT. JUSTICE CAN'T WAIT THIS AREA CAN. CAN WAIT WE TO DO SO AND THEN I WOULD ALSO SUGGEST THAT. YOU KNOW. AS SOMEONE WHO SERVES ON THE BUSINESS OF PROFESSIONS COMMITTEE WITH A NUMBER OF YOU. WILL NEED TO SET PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT STANDARDS. THIS IS WHAT WE DO AND A WIDE VARIETY OF INSTANCES. I'M ACTUALLY AT THIS MOMENT READING A BOOK ABOUT THE NINETEEN EIGHTEEN FLU. AND FOLKS MAY NOT KNOW THAT- YEARS AGO. THE MEDICAL PROFESSION DIDN'T HAVE ANY REGULATION AND IT WAS VIEWED. AS A PROFESSIONAL CHARLATANS OF THE FOLKS WHO WHO LITERALLY PRACTICING. MEDICINE AND IT WAS THE STANDARDS THAT WERE ESTABLISHED IN THAT FIELD IN THE TEACHING FIELD AND THE DENTIST REVEALED THE NURSING FIELD. THAT HAVE RAISED UP. PEOPLE'S RESPECT FOR- THOSE ENTITIES. THIS IS A COMMITTEE. THAT ADDRESSES THE PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT STANDARDS WHEN IT COMES TO LAWYERS. AND AS A LAWYER I THINK THAT'S A GOOD THING AND- FROM MY PERSPECTIVE I THINK IT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT. PARTICULARLY OF A PROFESSION THAT HAS THE AUTHORITY TO USE FORCE. AGAINST OUR CONSTITUENTS THAT WE ARE HOLDING. OUR OFFICERS TO THE HIGHEST STANDARD OF PROFESSIONALISM SO. I WOULD SUBMIT. THAT SUPPORTING THIS BILL OR THAT THE CONCEPT OF THIS BILL. IS REALLY. ABOUT SUPPORTING. PROFESSIONAL CONTEXT IN. MY HOPE IS THAT THE AUTHOR OBVIOUSLY IS TO CONTINUE WITH ALL STAKEHOLDERS ON THIS BUT WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING. ABOUT THIS AND- AND WITH THAT I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT THIS BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU OTHER MR HOLDEN. YES THANK YOU SIR BRADFORD AYE I THINK THAT IT I WANTED TO ALSO POINT OUT THAT- IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING JUST HAVING HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO WORK WITH YOU- FOR AN EXTENDED NUMBER OF MONTHS BECAUSE WE HAD- COMPARE BOWLING COMPATIBLE BILLS- THAT WERE MOVING THROUGH THE PROCESS- INTO RECENTLY BUT IT RECOGNIZING THAT YOUR COMMITMENT. AND WORKING WITH STAKEHOLDERS HAS CERTAINLY BEEN ESTABLISHED AND I KNOW THAT AS WE'VE TALKED OF YOU HAVE REFERENCED THOSE CONVERSATIONS AS WE TRY TO UNDERSTAND- ELEMENTS OF ARBIL SO I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT WAS ON THE RECORD ALSO WANTED TO. THANK YOU FOR. PURSUING THIS TYPE OF LEGISLATION I KNOW IT'S NOT EASY- AND I THINK THAT AS WAS POINTED OUT THAT RECOGNIZING THAT THERE ARE OTHER STATES THAN THIS SPACE WHO'VE ALREADY VENTRO. WERE TRYING TO CATCH UP WE'RE TRYING TO RECOGNIZE THE SOCIAL JUSTICE CHANGES NEED TO HAPPEN- AND NOT JUST DURING HIGH PROFILE- ON OFFICER INVOLVED- SHOOTINGS. MISCONDUCT I DON'T WANT TO SAY THE I THINK IT'S A FOR THE RECORD. THAT ARE PROPER PREPARATIONS CHAIR HAS SORT OF LAID OUT SORT OF A PROCESS OF HOW THIS BILL WILL BE EVALUATED ON THE FISCAL FROM A FISCAL STANDPOINT I THINK THAT HELPS THE BILL. THAT THERE WILL BE THAT TYPE OF. ANALYSIS THERE WILL BE GIVEN TO IT OR TAKE IT. CREATES I THINK A STRONG. UNDERPINNING AS IT GOES FORWARD. AND SO I JUST THINK THAT THAT'S IMPORTANT AT A DEN. IF THERE'S A NEED FOR ANY ADDITIONAL CLARIFICATION. OF INTENT. THAT MAY NOT BE CLEAR AS THE BILL AS CURRENTLY WRITTEN. THAT THE LETTER TO THE JOURNAL WOULD CERTAINLY HOPEFULLY ALLEVIATE THAT- BUT I THINK JUST. FUNDAMENTALLY THIS BILLS LIKE THIS WHEN COMMUNITY LOOKS AT IT. IT'S ABOUT TRYING TO REBUILD TRUST IT'S TRYING TO ESTABLISH A CLEAR A LEVEL OF COMMUNICATION THAT EVERYONE UNDERSTANDS AND APPRECIATES THE ROLE OF LAW ENFORCEMENT AND THE NECESSITY OF LAW ENFORCEMENT OTHER MAY CHANGE AS TIME GOES ON IN TERMS OF RESPONSIBILITIES OVER CERTAIN ELEMENTS I THINK THAT THERE'S- CERTAINLY OPEN CONVERSATION AND PROBABLY A PLACE OF COMMONALITY. ON CERTAIN FUNCTIONS THAT MAY NOT BE A PART OF A POLICE WORK GOING FORWARD. BUT I ALSO LIKE TO THINK. THAT THE MINIMUM WOMEN WHO GO OUT AND POLICE AND PUT THEIR LIVES ON THE LINE. THEY WANT THERE TO BE CLEARED. THREE THEY WANT THERE TO BE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR TRUST TO BE DEVELOPED WHY WOULD THEY WANT TO GO OUT INTO A COMMUNITY AND HAVE A US VERSUS THEM. CONFRONTATIONAL THE TIME. THERE HAS TO BE SORT OF THIS UNDERSTANDING THAT. WE'RE COLLECTIVE WE ARE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER. AS A SOCIETY OF A HEALTHY SOCIETY. AND SO YOU CANNOT EVERY. OTHER DAY TURN ON THE TELEVISION AND SEE SOME TYPE OF EXCESSIVE FORCE THAT LEADS TO GREAT BODILY HARM AND DEATH TO MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC. I THINK THAT THAT'S OKAY AND NOT TO SUGGEST THAT ANYONE IN LAW ENFORCEMENT BELIEVES THAT BUT- LEVEL OF TRAINING. KNOWING WHEN AND HOW TO ENGAGE HOW TO DE ESCALATE THESE ARE ALL VERY IMPORTANT. COMPONENTS AND SO TRUST AND LEGISLATION LIKE THIS THAT HELPS CREATE CLARITY. SO THE COMMUNITY KNOWS WHERE THE LINE IN THE SAND IS. BUT LAW ENFORCEMENT KNOWS WITH A LINE IN THE SAND IS. AND THAT THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO START WORKING IN A MORE COLLABORATIVE WAY. BASED ON OF THESE TYPE OF LEGISLATIONS THAT WILL CREATE THAT THE CLARITY SO. I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT YOUR BILL I'M A CO AUTHOR ON THE BILL. THE CAUCUS HAS ENDORSED YOUR BILL AS YOU ALREADY KNOW TO. AND I THINK YOUR BILL AS YOU'VE ALSO NOTED MAY NOT BE PERFECT. BUT IT'S DESIGNED TO SORT OF MOVE THE BALL DOWN THE FIELD. I'M TRYING TO ADDRESS SOME OF THESE LARGER ISSUES THAT ARE IN OUR FACE. EVERY DAY- DEALING WITH THE CONCERNS THAT. FULL OF COLOR ESPECIALLY ARE FEELING EVERY DAY. AND YOU KNOW JUST A QUICK POINT I WAS A CHILD MY MOM ALWAYS SAID WE WERE LITTLE THE NEW ONE COULD EVER BELIEVE THAT I WAS A LITTLE MORE THAT IF YOU EVER GET LOST FROM. YOU SEEK OUT THE POLICE OFFICER. YOU GO TO THAT OFFICER BECAUSE YOU'LL YOU'LL BE SAFE THAT'S HOW I WAS RAISED. AND NOW YOU HAVE YOUNG PEOPLE WHO WERE SEEN RELATIVES. FOR MISHANDLED BY THE POLICE THAT COULD LEAD TO DEATH. IT CAN'T BE THAT WAY. SO WHATEVER HAPPENED ALONG THE WAY. WE'VE GOT TO GET IT BACK ON TRACK AND I THINK THIS BILL HELPS SO I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT IT TODAY THANK YOU. THIS CAR THANK YOU MR SURE THANK YOU SENATOR FOR BRING THIS IMPORTANT AND DIFFICULT OF THE BILL FORWARD DURING THAT TIME- AND WHICH WERE A QUESTION A LOT ABOUT OUR SOCIETY HERE IN THE STATE AROUND THE STATION AND YOU KIND OF HAD A BECAUSE I JUDICIARY AND APPROVES- COMMITTEE QUESTION WHICH IS A GOOD THING BECAUSE I THINK THAT. THAT THERE ARE LAWS IN OPPORTUNITIES TO REALLY MOVE FORWARD- EVEN IN THE YEARS I MEAN LOOK NO AS MUCH AS WE ALL LIKE TO THINK THINK IT NONE OF US- BUT FOR BILLS ARE PERFECT- BUT BUT THE INTENT IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT AND THE ABILITY. AND AT THE END OF THE BUILDING TO REMAIN OPEN AND HAVE THAT DIALOGUE AND I'LL TELL YOU LIKE YOU KNOW IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE YOU LOOK AT BILLS- IF YOU'RE ABLE TO AT SOME POINT COME TO A COMPLETE AGREEMENT WITH OPPOSITION THEN IS THERE A FEW SAID ONLY THAT IT WAS WONDERFUL. IF YOU CAN'T COME TO UNDERSTAND AGREEMENT IS LIKE ALL THAT I WANT TO TALK TO US AT THE BILL AUTHORS NOT SO I TAKE ALTHOUGH THE GREEN A SUBSET SEVENTY RIGHT NOW UNTIL WERE NOT. EVEN NOT TAKING PAGES ARE BECAUSE FUNDING WAT I WAS ONCE A CALL IS NOT TALKING TO US SO YOU KNOW I KNOW YOU BUT I KNOW HOW YOU OPERATE AND UP I AND I. TRUST AND BELIEVE IN YOU. I HAD SO. IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT MORE WERE SUCH AS- EITHER. KNOWS TO THIS. LEGISLATIVE CYCLE I THINK THAT THE NEW. IS GREAT. I OR ONE OF THE HAND OF STATES. OF THAT DOES NOT HAVE THIS PROCESS AND- YOU KNOW AS YOU SEE IN. THE ANTI BLACK RACISM AND VIOLENCE IS SYSTEMIC IN PLEASE SEND. THAT'S WHERE WE'RE RECOGNIZE NATIONALLY IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT. INDIVIDUAL POLICE OFFICERS ARE BAD IT'S A SYSTEM THAT'S A SYSTEMIC ISSUES MEANS THAT WE CAN'T. SEPARATE OURSELVES FROM THAT JUST BECAUSE WE'RE A GOOD OR BAD PERSON- BUT OFTEN TIMES IN A LONG FOR SUPPORT TICKET IS A FEW BAD APPLES. WHICH IS ALSO TRUE THERE ARE SOME FEW BAD APPLES THAT THAT IF YOU EXCRETE FROM THE INDUSTRY- IS GOOD FOR EVERYONE INCLUDING. UP OF THE POLICE DEPARTMENTS AND SO NOBODY EVERYBODY WOULD PREFER I DON'T CARE IF YOU'RE A LAWYER A DOCTOR PLEASE ALSO I WILL PREFER TO PLEASE THEMSELVES. NOBODY WANTS SOMEONE ELSE LOOKING AT THEIR CONTACT AND SAYING YOU'RE A SPECIAL INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATION. YOU KNOW THAT YOU'RE DOING IT RIGHT OR SHOULD THE SOLUTION TO THAT WAY BUT THE REALITY IS NECESSARY. AND IT'S NECESSARY AT THIS MOMENT IN TIME HAS BEEN NECESSARY FOR A VERY LONG TIME. AND EVEN OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS HAS BEEN PLENTY OF OPPORTUNITIES FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT TO STEP OF STEP FORWARD WITH THAT. SOCIAL JUSTICE ADVOCATES A BIGGER A PATH AT THIS MOMENT IN TIME OUR COMMUNITY IS DEMANDING THAT WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS BECAUSE IT'S NECESSARY. AND SO- I TRULY BELIEVE THAT THIS FOCUSES ON- IN ACCOUNTABILITY CENTER THAT CALIFORNIA CANNOT WAIT TO PAST WEEK WE NEED TO MOVE THIS FORWARD AND- AND BE OPENED- AS IT GOES FORWARD- THE TWO SUGGESTIONS OF HOW CAN BE IMPROVED WHETHER IT'S NOW OR NEXT YEAR THE YEAR AFTER. WE ALWAYS HAVE TO DO THAT WE DO THAT MUCH FOR ALL OF OUR GREAT DEALS OF SIGNIFICANCE. AND YOU KNOW TO THE POINT THAT YOU KNOW POST DURING A JUST BE ADMINISTRATIVELY DONE OR- THEY PULL CHOIR THE TOSTRING OBVIOUS ALSO SHOULD KNOW THAT WOULD BE SERVED PROCESS AND THESE ARE BASICS THAT ANY YOU TAKE AN JUDGE KNOW WHAT THE RULES OF. THE GAME OUR BUT YOUR RIGHTS ARE AS EMPLOYEE. OF WHAT THOSE ARE THOSE ARE THAT THAT. NEED TO BE IT WILL BE DONE UNCONSCIOUS WILL BE DONE BECAUSE- WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERY THAT GOES. FOR OF LAW ENFORCEMENT WITH THE RIGHT AND- ARE. BUT THAT BEING SAID WE GET WE- CAN NOT WE CAN NO LONGER. HAVE OFFICERS THAT DO COMMIT EGREGIOUS ACTS. OF NOT BE ABLE JUST TO HOP AROUND FROM DEPARTMENT TO DEPARTMENT I THINK THAT. IT IS UNACCEPTABLE YOU JUST OPERATE ACTUALLY EVEN HEARING THAT FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT AND THEY AGREE. SO I THINK IT'S GREAT A UNIQUE PERIOD OF TIME WHERE WE ARE GETTING AGREEMENT FROM LONG FORCE OF THIS IS NECESSARY. THEY MAY HAVE A DIFFERENT VERSION OF WHAT WHAT IT MIGHT LOOK LIKE FOR THEM. BUT THE FACT THAT WERE ON THE SAME PAGE. IS IN ITSELF HISTORICAL. AND SIGNIFICANT AND SO FOR THAT I COMMEND YOU I COMMEND THE OPPOSITION FOR RECOGNIZING THE NEED THAT WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING. THAT I I'M A CO AUTHOR OF THIS BILL ACTUALLY SUPPORTED AND WILL SUPPORT SUBSEQUENT. OF LEGISLATION IF NECESSARY TO CONTINUE TO IMPROVE UPON IT. THANK YOU SIR. THANK YOU MUST GO. THANK YOU MISTER LET ME JUST SAY AT THE OUTSET OF THE QUICK I WANT TO SEE DESIRE BILL PASSED- IT'S- IT IS TIME AND WE SHOULD HAVE DONE AND OTHER STATES HAVE DONE IT AS HAS BEEN POINTED OUT. REPUBLICAN SUPPORT A DECERTIFICATION BILL THE HOPE THAT HOLDS PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE BECAUSE WE BELIEVE IN GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY. AND THAT THOSE WERE GIVEN POWER. AND THOSE WHO ARE GIVEN YOU KNOW MANY RESPONSIBILITIES THAT THEY THAT THEY ARE GOOD STEWARDS OF THAT. AND SO I'VE I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT I AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUE FROM PASADENA THAT THIS IS ABOUT TRUST. RIGHT IS ABOUT ESTABLISHING TRUST AND PEACE WHEN PEOPLE ARE HELD ACCOUNTABLE. THAT HOPE THAT HELPS PEOPLE TO TRUST THAT THERE IS A PROCESS THAT THERE IS- THERE IS ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THOSE WHO DO WRONG FOR THOSE WHO VIOLATE. PEOPLE'S RIGHTS BUT NOW IT COMES TO US WE GOT TO DO THE WORK. AND THIS IS MY PROBLEM IS WE HAVE A PROCESS. END OF THE PROCESS YES NO BILL IS PERFECT OF COURSE. BUT WE HAVE A PROCESS THAT WE GO THROUGH COMMITTEES. LEVELS OF COMMITTEES THAT A BILL SHOULD GO THROUGH THAT ALLOWS STAKEHOLDER INPUT THAT WE REALLY HAVEN'T HAD. DURING THIS LEGISLATIVE SESSION AND I DO APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR BECAUSE HE IS SOMEONE WHO I KNOW WHO I KNOW VERY WELL HAS A GREAT REPUTATION FOR WORKING WITH ALL SIDES AND FORGETTING THE STAKEHOLDERS TOGETHER- I THINK THE PROBLEM WITH THE BILL LANGUAGE THAT IS RIGHT NOW BEFORE US IS IT DOESN'T REFLECT. ALL THOSE STAKEHOLDER INTERESTS. AND I DON'T THINK THAT'S ANYTHING AGAINST THE AUTHOR HIMSELF IS JUST THAT WE ARE IN THE SHORT. TIME FRAME. AND THAT THERE HASN'T BEEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE. A LOT OF THE VETTING THAT WOULD NATURALLY HAPPEN IN THIS COMMITTEE AND APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE- IN HAVING MORE NEGOTIATIONS AND MAKING SURE THAT WE DON'T MISS. CRITICAL PIECES OF THIS WE HAVE TO DO THIS RIGHT. AND SO. TO MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN FRANCISCO WHO AYE AYE WHO I KNOW CARES VERY DEEPLY ABOUT DUE PROCESS. AND WHO IN TRUTH AND THAT THAT WE ENSURE THAT. THEPROCESS THAT GOES ON HERE IS IT IS A FAIR ONE. THE CLEAR LANGUAGE IN THIS BILL DOES NOT GIVE POST DISCRETION. IT DOES NOT GIVE US DISCRETION IF YOU LOOK AT THE LANGUAGE AND- THIRTEEN FIVE TEN POINT EIGHT B. THE COMMISSION SHALL ADOPT A REGULATION. BY REGULATION A DEFINITION OF SERIOUS MISCONDUCT THAT SHALL SERVE AS THE CRITERIA TO BE CONSIDERED FOR INELIGIBILITY OR REVOCATION OF CERTIFICATION THIS DEFINITION SHALL. WITHOUT LIMITATION INCLUDE ALL THE FOLLOWING. WE ARE SAYING THAT IT SHALL INCLUDE THE LANGUAGE THAT. MY COLLEAGUE FROM BIG BEAR POINTED OUT. THAT ACTS THAT VIOLATE THE LAW. IT'S A VERY BROAD STANDARD MUST BE INCLUDED IN THE DEFINITION. THAT DOESN'T GET POST DISCRETION. IT SAYS YOU SHALL HAVE THIS IN YOUR DEFINITION THAT'S A VERY BROAD WAY TO DESCRIBE IT AND SO I THINK AT A VERY MINIMUM. EACH WE NEED TO ELIMINATE THAT SECTION. BECAUSE THE OTHER SECTIONS VERY CLEARLY POINTED OUT THAT THE GETS OUT EVERYTHING THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. AND I'LL JUST GO THROUGH THE REALLY QUICKLY ACTS OF DISHONESTY MISREPORTING ACTION ABUSE OF POWER.ACTS OF PHYSICAL ABUSE SEXUAL ASSAULT. BIAS THOUGH THOSE ARE ALL IN THOSE ARE THE THINGS WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT THIS PERSON. AT THIS OFFICER WHO WHO HAS BEEN FOUND TO HAVE VIOLATED THESE THINGS IS NOT ALLOWED TO GO ON TO ANOTHER DEPARTMENT BUT THEN WHEN YOU ADD THIS SECTION SAYS. ANY ACTS OF VIOLENCE ALONG WITH THAT THAT INCLUDES A WHOLE HOST OF THINGS MANY THINGS ARE VIOLATIONS OF LAW BUT DO THEY RISE TO THE LEVEL OF AN ABUSE OF POWER. MISCONDUCT THAT WARRANTS TAKING SOMEONE'S LIVELIHOOD AWAY BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE TALKING ABOUT SAYING THAT THIS PERSON COULD NEVER WORK IN LAW ENFORCEMENT AGAIN. SO THAT'S A PROBLEM WE NEED TO FIX THAT AND WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO THAT. IT'S NOT TO THE LETTER TO THE JOURNAL IT'S DO AMEND IN THE BILL AND MAKING SURE THAT THAT LANGUAGE IS VERY CLEAR. AND WE DON'T HAVE THIS. YOU KNOW BROAD DEFINITION AND THE LANGUAGE SO I THINK IT A VERY MINIMAL NEED TO CHANGE THAT TO MAKE THIS A BETTER BILL. TO ENSURE THAT IT HAS THE PROTECTIONS THAT WE TALKED ABOUT THE OTHER STATES THAT HAVE PASSED. DECERTIFICATION THE OTHER KEY THING. IT'S NOT IN HERE IS POPOLARE POPOLARE IS COMPLETELY MISSING. FROM THE COMMISSION REVIEW IT'S NOT IN THERE. YOU WOULD HAVE THAT AT THE AGENCY LEVEL AT THE LOCAL AGENCY LEVEL YES BUT UNDER THE CLEAR TERMS OF THIS LANGUAGE. UNDER THE COMMISSION REVIEW ALL IT TAKES IS SOMEONE TO MAKE A COMPLAINT AND THE COMMISSION GOES THROUGH A MAKES A FINDING. OF OUR PROTECTIONS ARE NOT INCLUDED IN HERE. AND EVERY OTHER STATE THOSE DUE PROCESS PROTECTIONS ARE THERE. SO WHY SHOULDN'T WE ENSURE THAT THAT IS IN THIS. SAME THING AS MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN DIEGO POINTED OUT AS IT IS I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT. TO HAVE THAT IN THE LANGUAGE AND IT'S SOMETHING I THINK WOULD GET CAUGHT IF WE WERE GOING TO. OUR NORMAL PROCESS- AND ENSURING THAT AN APPEALS PROCESS IS A FAIR AND UNBIASED I THINK WE ALL AGREE THAT WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT WHEN SOMEONE IS. SUBJECT TO A REVIEW. THAT WE ENSURE THAT'S A FIR AND UNBIASED PROCESS AND I THINK THE WAY THAT THIS THE BOARD IS COMPOSED- AND THE LACK OF DUE PROCESS MEANS THAT THIS WILL PROBABLY NOT BE A VERY FAIR PROCESS FOR PEOPLE TO GO THROUGH I THINK WE SHOULD HAVE VERY MINIMAL ENSURE THAT THAT IS THE CASE. YOU KNOW THERE'S OTHER ISSUES THAT I THINK WE GET INTO BUT YOU KNOW AS A CHAIR OF A PROBE SADISTIC IT IS EXPENSIVE WE SHOULD BE IS ASSERTING MAKE IT WHAT IS THE COST. WE HAVEN'T EVEN SET THE FIA. I MEAN SO THAT'S WE GOT FOUR DAYS HERE AND I KNOW THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF THINGS THAT HAPPEN THIS YEAR. BUT MAYBE THAT'S JUST ANOTHER REASON FOR US TO LIKE. REALLY DELVE INTO THIS AND MAKE SURE WE GET IT RIGHT. OR DON'T JUST PASS SOMETHING THAT DOESN'T HAVE. ALL THE THINGS THAT WE'VE SEEN B. AND OTHER PARTS AND OTHER STATES WHERE THEY'VE DONE SIMILAR THINGS RIGHT. YOU KNOW JUST PASS SOMETHING AND SAY OKAY WE'LL TRY AND FIX IT LATER WILL PUT A LETTER IN THE JOURNAL IF YOU KNOW THAT THERE'S A PROBLEM. LET'S FIX IT NOW. AND ENSURE THAT WE HAVE THE BEST CALL. PRODUCT IT ENSURES JUSTICE AND FAIRNESS. FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE SUBJECT OF ABUSE AND WE DON'T HAVE. OFFICERS AS YOU SAID AND WE DON'T HAVE THIS IS BETTER FOR EVERYONE IS BETTER FOR A LONG FORCES BETTER FOR THE PUBLIC THAT WE DON'T HAVE LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS WHO ARE ALLOWED TO GO TO OTHER AGENCIES WHEN THEY HAVE COMMITTED GROSS ACTS OF ABUSE AND MISCONDUCT. AND IT ALSO PROTECTS AS YOU SAID. LAW ENFORCEMENT BECAUSE NEWS NEWS THEY WANT TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH. THOSE WHO ARE COMMITTING SUCH ACTS. BUT WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO GET THIS RIGHT AND BUT YOU KNOW RUSSIAN HEARING RUSSIAN WITNESSES NOT FOLLOWING OUR RULES AND TRYING TO PUSH THIS THING THROUGH IN THE LAST DAYS OF THE LEGISLATURE. TO ME IS NOT A VERY GOOD PROCESS I THINK WE CAN SAY THAT. THANK YOU TO OF THE BILL THAT WE CAN ALL SUPPORT AND TO BE VERY BIPARTISAN AND IT WOULD BE IS. A BILL THAT WILL BE GOOD FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS. BUT IT'S NOT IN THE CURRENT LANGUAGE THAT WE GOT THE FORCE AND SO WHAT I WOULD REALLY ASK IS IT CAN WE- CAN WE ENSURE THAT AT LEAST THOSE TWO THINGS GET TAKEN CARE OF. I MEAN WITH THE AUTHOR MAYBE COMMIT TO CHANGING THOSE THINGS THE PROBAR ISSUE. AND THE BROAD DEFINITION OF ACTS THAT VIOLATE THE LAW. I THINK THOSE WOULD BE TWO IS THAT SOMETHING THAT WE CAN WORK ON BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF TIME. AND WHAT ABOUT THOSE CHANGES BEFORE THIS THING COMES TO A VOTE BEFORE THE FULL BODY. I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT BUT. IN MY IDEAL WORLD WE WOULD GO THROUGH THE NATURAL POCESS AND STAKEHOLDER PROCESS AND COMMITTEE PROCESS THAT WE NORMALLY GO THROUGH. SO TO THE AUTHOR I MEAN COULD YOU MAYBE ADDRESS. THOSE TWO ISSUES AS- AS THIS GOES FORWARD I MEAN WE'VE ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES TO GET TO THIS POINT TODAY IT'S NOT LIKE A FULL BAR HASN'T BEEN DISCUSSED IT IS NOT LIKE THE EXPANSION OF WHAT CONSTITUTES A VIOLATION OR DECERTIFICATION HASN'T BEEN DISCUSSED AND WE SPLIT THE BABY AND THE HAIR AS MANY WAYS AS WE CAN AND EVERY TIME WE WENT TO THE EXTREME LEFT WE GOT PUSHBACK FROM ONCE I WANT TO STREAM RIGHT WE GOT PUSHED BACK TO THAT. THIS IS THE WHAT WE FELT WAS UP THE METAL BACK PANEL LIKE DREADED THIRTY TO BEST TO BRING. MOST PEOPLE TOGETHER IS THIS A PERFECT BILL BY NO STRETCH OF IMAGINATION. BUT IS A GOOD BILL IT'S A GOOD BILL AND IT'S MORE THAN WHAT WE HAVE IN CALIFORNIA AND IT'S- WORTH FIGHTING FOR RIGHT NOW. ALL THOSE DISCUSSIONS THAT YOU'VE RAISED BOTH IN SUPPORT OF OPPOSITION WILL CONTINUE TO GO ON ALL OVER THE NEXT FOUR FIVE DAYS WITHOUT A DOUBT- TO MAKE A COMMITMENT TO RIGHT HERE I CAN'T DO THAT BUT I. PROMISE TO MAKE THE HAVE TO CONTINUE DIALOGUE AND CONTINUE WORK IT'S A WORK IN PROGRESS AND AS YOU KNOW. MY REPUTATION I I'M WILLING TO ENGAGE WITH. ALL PARTIES ALL SIDES ALL OPINIONS- THAT'S WHAT I PRIDE MYSELF ON AND THAT'S WHAT'S GOT US HERE TODAY AND SO I WILL MAKE THAT COMMITMENT I WILL CONTINUE THE DIALOGUE AND I THINK. WE'LL CONTINUE TO WORK. WELL AN AVERAGE. THAT BUT IT IS NOT IN THIS LANGUAGE RIGHT NOW PROBAR NOT IN THIS LANGUAGE. THE DEFINITION VERY CLEARLY DOESN'T GIVE POST DISCRETION AND HAS IS VERY BROAD DEFINITION. THAT'S IN THE LANGUAGE RIGHT NOW AND THAT'S THAT'S WHAT I HAVE TO VOTE. SO UNLESS THAT IS ACTUALLY CHANGING THE LANGUAGE I CAN'T GET TO A PLACE WHERE I CAN SUPPORT IT AND HERE'S THE THING I WANT TO READ I WANT TO BE SUPPORTIVE OF A GOOD FOR DECERTIFICATION BILL THAT ACCOMPLISHES THE OBJECTIVES THAT I THINK WE ALL AGREE ON. BUT WE NEED TO HAVE THAT CHANGE WE NEED TO DO OUR JOB OF LEGISLATING BY MAKING SURE THAT LANGUAGE IS CLEAR AND SO. I KNOW THAT YOU ARE SOME OF THE BRINGS PEOPLE TOGETHER AND I JUST ENCOURAGE THAT TO HAPPEN. IN THE VERY FEW DAYS WE HAVE LEFT. HERE BECAUSE RIGHT NOW IT SEEMS LIKE THIS LANGUAGE IS REALLY MORE ONE SIDES LANGUAGE. I WOULD SAY IT'S MORE ACLU LANGUAGE. THEN IT IS THE RESULT OF A PROCESS WHERE ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS ARE TALKING ABOUT THIS AND MAKING IT THE BEST BILL POSSIBLE. OKAY. OTHER BECAUSE THIS RACE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. CENTER BRADFORD. I'M NOT GOING TO REPEAT WITH MY COLLEAGUES HAVE ALREADY SHARED WITH YOU- IT'S CLEAR AND EVEN IN THE LETTERS OF OPPOSITION THAT WE RECEIVED- IT'S CLEAR THAT WE NEED A DECERTIFICATION PROCESS. THERE'S NO OTHER BILL BEFORE US THAT WILL ADDRESS THIS ISSUE AND THE ISSUE IS JUST TOO IMPORTANT AT THIS TIME. I DO RECOGNIZE FROM THE OPPOSITION THE THEIR CONCERNS AND I APPRECIATE THAT YOU SPENT THE TIME WITH THE STAKEHOLDERS TO TRY TO REACH A NUMBER REACH THE LANGUAGE THAT'S GOING TO GET THIS THROUGH THE FINISH LINE. I FROM FROM THE LETTERS FROM MY LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT. IT'S CLEAR THAT THERE WILL BE SOME UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES. AND I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU IN FUTURE LEGISLATION TO TAKE CARE OF THOSE THINGS- BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT. THE THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN THE GOOD COPS TO SUFFER BECAUSE OF THE BAD COPS BECAUSE THEY THEY ARE ALSO ON THE SIDE OF WANTING THIS DECERTIFICATION PROCESS UP FROM THE- CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF HIGHWAY PATROLMEN. I APPRECIATED SPECIFICALLY THAT THEY WROTE. THAT THEY WERE WILLING TO SUPPORT A MEANS OF REVOKING CERTIFICATES CURRENTLY ISSUED BY THE EXISTING PEACE OFFICER STANDARDS TRUST AND TRAINING POST ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO FELONIES AND OTHER TYPES OF SERVICEMEN'S CONDUCT. ALL SIDES AGREE WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING YOURS IS THE ONLY BILL THAT'S GOING TO PROVIDE THAT. YOU'VE USED DAVE THIS AT THE VERY BEGINNING IT'S NOT A PERFECT BILL BUT THIS IS THE BILL WE HAVE. AND THIS IS WHAT WE HAVE TO VOTE ON. THE I AM I'VE ALWAYS BEEN CONCERNED WITH THIS US AND THEM. WHEN IT COMES TO LAW ENFORCEMENT. AND IT SHOULDN'T BE AND I WAS UNAWARE OF MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN FRANCISCO. THANK YOU FOR THE HISTORY LESSON AND I THINK THAT. WE WILL BEGIN THE PROCESS NOW OF THE SETTING THE STANDARDS SO THAT WE ELEVATE OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT TO THAT POSITION WHERE THEY WERE WHEN I WAS A CHILD JUST AS MY COLLEAGUE FROM. PASADENA EVERYBODY ASPIRED TO BE A POLICE OFFICER- IF AT I WANT THOSE DAYS TO COME BACK. I WANT OUR PEOPLE TO FEEL SAFE. I WANT TO AYE AYE I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO THAT DAY. DECERTIFICATION HAVING PROCESS FOR DECERTIFICATION IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. YOURS IS OUR BILL BEFORE US. AND BECAUSE OF THAT I WILL BE SUPPORTING IT THANK YOU. THANK YOU OTHER. COMMENTS CENTER THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND I AM GLAD YOU ARE THE AUTHOR OF THIS IS BECAUSE ABSOLUTE WE WORKED WELL TOGETHER OVER THE YEARS AND I AND I TRUST YOUR INSTINCTS AND YOUR ABILITY TO DRIVE THIS I WOULD NEVER EXPECT THIS IS GOING TO BE A BILL WITH EVERYBODY IN AGREEMENT THAT IT'S JUST NOT WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN HERE. AND BUT I DO APPRECIATE THE STRUCTURE THAT YOU HAVE CREATED HERE ABOUT. SETTING A STANDARD INSTANCE STATUTE AND THAT ALLOWING POST TO CREATE THE RULES. AND I WILL TELL YOU I DO NOT WANT YOU TO NARROW WHAT YOU HAVE DONE. AND A GOOD EXAMPLE WE TALKED ABOUT TICKETS I DON'T THINK ANYONE UP HERE WOULD SUPPORT THE NOTION THAT IF AN OFFICER. GETS A MOVING VIOLATION AND THAT THAT'S GOING TO RISE TO THE REVIEW AND I POST IS NOT GOING TO DO THAT HOWEVER. A AT SOME POINT I COULD SEE. ANOTHER TRAFFIC VIOLATION BEING EVIDENCE OF A BLATANT DISREGARD FOR THE LAW THE POST MIGHT WANT TO LOOK AT. SO IF WE'RE NOT CAREFUL AND IF WE'RE AND IF WE EXEMPT THIS EXEMPT THAT FROM POST ABILITY TO LOOK. WE POTENTIALLY ALLOW SOMEONE WITH A BLATANT DISREGARD OF THE LAW TO CONTINUE TO BE CERTIFIED AS A POLICE OFFICER. I DON'T WANT I DON'T WANT TO SET UP A SITUATION WHERE WE ARE CREATING THAT. AND YOUR BILL DOESN'T DO THAT YOUR BILL ALLOWS POST TO CREATE ADEQUATE REGULATIONS IF THEY DON'T THEN THAT'S UP TO US TO GO BACK IN IN. THE SEPARATION OF POWERS AND FIX WHAT WE THINK THEY DID WRONG. SO THAT IS WHY I THINK THIS IS A GOOD BILL IT ABSOLUTELY MEETS OUR STANDARDS THIS IS NOT NECESSARILY A BILL THAT WOULD HAVE COME TO US AND UNDER OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES. BUT IT'S BEFORE US AND OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO OF ANALYZE IT WHICH WE HAVE DONE AND THE TOM CLARK DID AN EXCELLENT JOB OF TRYING TO WORK WITH AND I REALLY APPRECIATE YOU AT A LATER DATE. WORKING WITH OUR COMMITTEE TO MAKE SURE. THAT BUT OUR QUESTIONS ANSWERED AND- AND THIS IS A OF I WAS I'M A CO AUTHOR WHICH I DON'T NORMALLY DO WITH THOSE THAT COME TO THE COMMITTEE BUT THIS IS SO IMPORTANT. FOR CALIFORNIA TO BE DOING RIGHT NOW. THAT I WAS HAPPY TO BE A CO AUTHOR AND I AM. REALLY PROUD OF THE STATE THIS BILL IS IN. AS IT MOVES OUT OF COMMITTEE AND PROUD OF THE WORK THAT YOU'VE DONE I KNOW IT'S BEEN A LONG ROAD AND FRUSTRATING ROAD. BUT I THINK IT IS OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO MOVE THIS THIS BILL ALONG AT THIS POINT AND OF COURSE WE WILL STAY ENGAGED AS NECESSARY. BECAUSE THESE LAWS DO HAVE I NEED TO BE. TO HAVE OVERSIGHT AND HAVE. THE LEGISLATURE MAKING SURE THAT AS IT GETS IMPLEMENTED IT GETS IMPLEMENTED AS WE WOULD EXPECT AND TO FIX ISSUES AS THEY AS THEY WROTE TO OFTEN IN THIS LEGISLATURE WE PASS A BIT A POLICY AND WE WASH OUR HANDS OF IT AND NOBODY CARES ABOUT IMPLEMENTATION THAT'S NOT WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN HERE NOR SHOULD IT THIS. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IS GOING TO BE ITERATIVE OVERTIME AND THAT THAT DYNAMIC POLICY IS WE SHOULD BE DOING MORE OF THAT AND THAT IS I KNOW WHAT YOUR COMMITMENT IS AND WHAT THIS BILL REPRESENTS A I APPRECIATE YOU APPRECIATE YOUR TALENTS WITH OUR COMMITTEE KIND OF WORKING THROUGH THE ISSUES. AND I THANK YOU FOR A VERY VERY SOLID BILL THAT WE DEFINITELY NEED TO MOVE SO WITHOUT SENATOR ASK YOU TO CLOSE. AS FAR AS TOMORROW JUST TAKE ALL THAT WITH SAID IN. A LET THE MICHAEL BUT I JUST QUICKLY ADD. FOR SOMEONE. THE DIALOGUE ON BOTH SIDES BECAUSE I THINK IF IT TO TAKE A HERE. WE ALL WANT. POLICE TO CERTIFICATION. WE CAN CONTINUE TO. SQUABBLE GRINS WHILE ABOUT WHAT'S THE PROPER METHOD BUT- WE ALL KNOW THE TIME IS COME TO HAVE A WAY TO RAINY AND BACK PROBLEMS NOT GO ONCE BUT BALANCE AND THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL IS TRYING TO TARGET THOSE CLEAR VIOLATORS THAT WE ALL KNOW EXIST- JUST LIKE YOUHAVE BAD LEGISLATORS YOU HAVE BAD TEACHERS GOT BAD DOCTORS TO BELIEVE ONE READ MEN AND WE DO NOT HAVE THAT POPS IN NEED TO BE ADDRESSED. WE'RE LIVING IN A FANTASY WORLD SO I APPRECIATE THAT AND I TAKE THIS PERSONALLY AS I STATED IN MY OPENING BUT I SHOULD HEAR THE GUY WHO'S CLOSE TO BEING A POLICE OFFICER. I WAS THIS CLOSE TO BECOMING A POLICE OFFICER. I WAS RECRUITED BY A GOOD FRIEND OF MINE WHO JUST RETIRED FROM THIRTY FIVE YEARS VALLEY PD. HE SAT BY MY SIDE AND HE'S HOLD MY HAND ON EVERY BIT OF THIS BILL. THE MAKE SURE WE GOT IT RIGHT. BECAUSE HE IS PROUD OF THIS THIRTY FIVE YEARS OF A POLICE OFFICER. IN AT THIRTY FIVE YEARS HE HAS NEVER ONCE FIRED HIS WEAPON. AND HE MALES OF ALL THE MANY. GOOD COPS THIRTY IN THE DEPARTMENT BUT HE COULD CLEARLY IDENTIFY THOSE BAD APPLES THOSE BAD APPLES THAT CONTINUE TO CYCLE THEIR WAY TO THE PARK HAD NEVER TO BE FAR. A BAD APPLE WHO RAPED MY GIRLFRIEND IN COLLEGE LAPD OFFICER WHO RAPED MY GIRLFRIEND CAUGHT AND SHE WAS TOO ASHAMED TO REPORT IT BECAUSE SHE THOUGHT NO ONE WOULD EVER BELIEVE. SO THE TIME IS RIGHT SO I TAKE THE WORDS OF. DR KING OF THE URGENCY OF NOW. AND THIS IS WHERE WE FIND OURSELVES RIGHT NOW IN CALIFORNIA URGENCY OF NOW. AND IF NOT NOW THEN WHEN. IT IS UP TO US TO RAINY AND CREATE A MECHANISM AGAIN THIS IS NOT A PERFECT BILL. BUT IT'S BETTER THAN WHAT WE HAVE. AND WE SHOULDN'T LET THE PERFECT BE THE ENEMY OF THE GOOD. I DO YOU HAVE MY COMMITMENT THAT I'M GOING TO CONTINUE TO WORK AND LISTEN AS I'VE DONE AND EVERYTHING THAT I'VE DONE SINCE BEEN ELECTED OFFICIALS I GUESS I HAVE PLENTY OF FRIENDS WHO ARE LAW ENFORCEMENT I'VE UNCLE WHO DID THIRTY YEARS. IN THE MILITARY POLICE. I HAVE FAMILY WHO PUT ON THE- BADGE AND UNIFORM SO. I'M NOT A STRANGER TO THE CHALLENGES THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT FACE AND AS I STATED. MANY OF THE MEN AND WOMEN ON THE GARDENA POLICE DEPARTMENT HAVE BEEN MY FRIEND FOR THIRTY PLUS YEARS. YOU KNOW. RUSS TEMPEL WHO'S NO LONGER WITH US WE CLOSE TOGETHER FOR MEMBERS YEARS AT RALEIGH PARK. I GUARDINO POLICE OFFICER. WHO SUCCUMBED TO CANCER A FEW YEARS AGO ONE OF MY CLOSEST FRIENDS. SO I HAVE PLENTY OF FRIENDS IN LAW ENFORCEMENT SO. I SAT THERE AND I'VE SOUGHT COUNSEL FROM MANY OF THEM BECAUSE I DIDN'T DO THE TOP. LIKE I SAID. CAN WE GET EVERYBODY IN THE ROOM IN THE GREEN NOW. BUT I WHAT WE HAVE IS A GOOD START. AND I THINK AGAIN WE NEED TO MOVE FOR. TO CONTINUE TO SAY IMPARTIALITY. IF IT'S ALL LAW ENFORCEMENT THEN. JOHN Q. PUBLIC THE CITIZEN FEELS WORST IMPARTIALITY AND THAT WE'VE TRIED TO COME UP WITH A BLAND OF LAW ENFORCEMENT AND CIVILIANS TO MAKE UP THAT. REVIEW BOARD SO WE'RE TRYING TO REMOVE THOSE BIASES THERE AND ALLOW ALL VOICES TO BE HEARD SO. ON THAT NOTE I THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY PRESENT THIS BILL BEFORE EACH AND EVERYONE OF YOU I. YOUR DIALOGUE IN YOUR QUESTIONS AND YOUR COMMITMENT TO DECERTIFICATION. AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL. THANK YOU SENATOR WE DO HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND MOTION IS TO PASS ALL THE WORLD PLEASE. STONE HI STERN AYE GALLAGHER GALLAGHER GNOME SHELL. JOE NOT VOTING TO. TWO FIVE GONZALEZ I'VE BEEN GOES AYE HOLDEN. I KALRA. KALRA KILEY YEAH HIGHLY NO MAIENSCHEIN MAIENSCHEIN I OVERALL OBERNOLTE NO REYES REYES AYE. THAT HAS A THAT THANK YOU THE BILLS OUT THANK YOU MISTER MEMBER RIGHT WE HAVE ONE MORE ITEM BEFORE US ITEM NUMBER TWO WHICH IS H. R. ONE OH THREE I'M GOING TO GO DOWN THE MEETING. FOR THE- BILL. THE BILL MOVED INSIDE THERE MISSED MISTER YOU HAVE H. R. OF THREE. THANK YOU GO AHEAD AND- YES IT AND THIS IS ACTUALLY SOMETHING I WOULD HOPE WE WOULD NEED TO DO AS YOU ALL. THAT CALIFORNIA RESERVE TO THE SUPREME THE TO DETERMINE QUALIFICATIONS FOR THE PRACTICE OF LAW IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND WE HAVE SUCCESSFULLY. WE HAVE PUSHED FOR A LONG TIME FOR THEM TO LOOK AT THE STANDARDS BY WHICH THE MEASURE ATTORNEY APPLICANTS AND PRECOR RECENTLY REDUCED THE CUT SCORE. TO A IS SOMETHING THAT WE HAD BEEN ASKING FOR IN QUITE SOME TIME BECAUSE THE CUT SCORE AND THAT PROCESS TURNS OUT TO HAVE. A VERY DETRIMENTAL EFFECTS ON ATTORNEY APPLICANTS ESPECIALLY FROM COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AND THIS COMMITTEES HELD HEARINGS AGAIN AND GET AND REALLY ASK THAT QUESTION AGAIN HOW WE DIVERSIFY. THE BENCH THE BAR AND THOSE WHO WOULD SEEK TO BECOME MEMBERS OF THE BAR. WE HAD TRIED TO AS AS UNDER THE CURRENT SITUATION. WHERE IT'S DIFFICULT TO PULL BAR EXAMS WHERE IT'S DIFFICULT WHOLE CLASSES THERE ARE A LOT OF POTENTIAL ATTORNEYS OUT THERE WHO HAVE DONE THE WORK AT LAW SCHOOLS. AND MAY OR MAY NOT BE ABLE TO TAKE THE BAR THERE'S A SKETCH OF OUR SCHEDULE FOR OCTOBER BUT IT MAY NOT HAPPEN A LOT OF THE ONLINE BAR EXAMINATIONS HAVE BEEN CONTROVERSIAL ACROSS THIS COUNTRY SO WE'RE NOT SURE THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. SO THIS I HAVE PASSED AND THE NUMBER OF CONVERSATIONS HAVE ASKED THE SUPREME COURT. TO NOT ONLY HAVE REDUCED TO CUT SCHOOL. BUT ALSO RETROACTIVELY APPLY THAT BACK FIVE YEARS AND THE REASON FOR THE FIVE YEARS THAT'S AS LONG. AS CURRENTLY THE BAR EXAM. IS REALLY VALID SO THEY COULD GO BACK THOSE FIVE YEARS. AND REVIEW THOSE APPLICANTS AND IF THEY HAD MADE THAT CUT. WHICH SEEMS TO BE ADEQUATE NOW FOR MOVING FORWARD. WHY NOT FOR THOSE ATTORNEYS AND THAT WOULD BRING MORE TURNING INTO CALIFORNIA AT A TIME WHERE WE REALLY NEED THEM. TO MORE TURKEYS WE'VE HAD CALIFORNIA HAS HAD A LONG HISTORY OF NOT ACCEPTING RECIPROCITY FROM OTHER STATES OF HAVING. TOO HIGH A STANDARD. ON THE NOTION THAT THAT THAT THAT PROTECTS THE PUBLIC BECAUSE IT MAKES A HIGHER STAND FOR ATTORNEYS. THAT'S NOT ACTUALLY TRUE. AND THE BARS ROLE IS TO LOOK AT THE PRACTICE OF TOURNEY'S ONCE THEY BECOME ATTORNEYS AND WEED OUT THE BAD ACTORS THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO DO AND- AND I SAID IT TOO HIGH OF A BAR FOR. ENTRANCE INTO THE PRACTICE OF LAW. THEN THEY'RE ACTUALLY WEEDING OUT FOLKS WHO WOULD BE GOOD ATTORNEYS NOT NECESSARILY SUBJECT TO DISCIPLINE SOME OF THE BAR DOES THEIR JOB. BUT WOULD HOPEFULLY BE MORE AVAILABLE TO GO INTO THE COMMUNITIES. WHERE THERE AREN'T A LOT OF LAWYERS PRACTICING. WE WOULD HAVE MORE CHINESE AVAILABLE FOR LEGAL SERVICES WE WOULD HAVE MORE TOURNEY'S AVAILABLE UP AND DOWN THE SPECTRUM AND NOT JUST BEING THE FOUR HUNDRED SIX HUNDRED DOLLAR AN HOUR ATTORNEYS. BUT REALLY BE IN OUR COMMUNITY SO THAT'S WHAT THIS RESOLUTION IS ABOUT. WE CANNOT PASS A LAW. THAT SAYS YOU MUST. RETROACTIVELY APPLY WE CANNOT PASS A LAW THAT SAYS YOU MUST SET A. DIFFERENT STANDARD. FOR THE. THE BAR PASS THAT CUTS CORD THAT WE HAVE TO BUT WE ARE TRYING TO IN THE SUPREME COURT. IN BEING WILLING TO TAKE A LOOK AT A POOL OF APPLICANTS WHO ARE THERE NOW. AND BY THAT CUT SCORE WE KNOW WE'RE GOING TO SEE MORE APPLICANTS OF COLOR. INTO THE PRACTICE OF LAW MEMBERS WE DESPERATELY NEED THAT THAT'S WHAT THIS RESOLUTION IS ABOUT IS REALLY JUST ATKINS RECORD TAKE ANOTHER LOOK AT THAT AND WILL BE A STATEMENT OF. THE THIS COMMITTEE AT A STATEMENT OF THE ASSEMBLY AS A BODY. SAYING WE ARE USING OUR AUTHORITY AS A RANCHER GOVERNMENT. TO PUT AS MUCH PRESSURE ON THE BAR AND THE SUPREME COURT AS POSSIBLE TO MAKE WHAT WE FEEL IS A CORRECT DECISION THAT'S WHAT THIS RESOLUTION IS ABOUT AND I ASK THE ARRIVAL. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN- WE HAVE WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. DO YOU HAVE ANYONE. WE HAVE PRIMARY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT YEAH I BELIEVE KEVIN BAKER AND JOHN CRITTENDEN.

OVER THESE PAST FEW MONTHS AND IT IS JUST NOT FAIR- OBVIOUSLY I SUPPORT DIPLOMA PRIVILEGE- WE DIDN'T GET THAT AS WE CAN MAYBE BELIEVE THERE'S GONNA BE AN ONLINE- BAR EXAM IN OCTOBER WE'VE SEEN THE PROBLEMS WITH THAT OTHER STATES THIS IS JUST NOT FAIR THIS SEEMS TO BE THE EASIEST AND MOST EQUITABLE THING THAT THAT THE SUPREME COURT COULD DEAL TO AT LEAST- GRANDFATHER SOME OF THESE AT. THE END OF THESE LAWYERS INTO THE PRACTICE SINCE WE'VE ALREADY DECIDED THE CUT SCORE WAS INAPPROPRIATE IT SEEMS FAIR AND EQUITABLE JUST THANK YOU FOR PAYMENTS FOR IT I HAVE HEARD FROM SO MANY- STUDENTS WHO AND FOLKS WE'RE JUST IN LIMBO AND SO THIS AT LEAST HOPEFULLY IF WE CAN APPLY ADDITIONAL PRESSURE CAN CAN HELP RELIEVE SOME OF THAT. AND IT'S THE MOST IDEAL EVERYTHING WE COULD DO BUT IT'S A START THANK YOU. THANK YOU. MISTER TO. MISTER CHAIR- MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR MOVING THIS FORWARD I KNOW YOU AND ARE CALLING FROM SAN DIEGO AND OTHERS WE'VE REALLY BEEN TRYING TO PUSH THIS AND I'M SURE IF THE CALIFORNIA STATE BAR IS LISTENING TO THIS BUT I CERTAINLY OPE THEY SUPPORTED I'D LIKE TO ASK THEM. WHERE THEY ARE ON THIS ISSUE. LET ME JUST CRIED I WASN'T GONNA SPEAK BUT I WANT TO START A COUPLE OF QUICK STATISTICS. 90% OF ALL LAWYERS HELP THE 10% OF AMERICA. AND THE FLIP SIDE OF THAT 10% OF ALL LAWYERS HELP THE OTHER NINETY PERCENT. SO MUCH OF WHAT IS ON EQUAL ABOUT OUR SOCIETY IS EXACERBATED. BY OUR- PROFESSION. WHEN YET ANOTHER WORKING VERY INTENSELY ON HOW WE'RE GOING OVER. AN EVICTION CRISIS A FIVE POINT FOUR MILLION TENANTS ESTIMATED TO BE FACING EVICTION AS OF SEPTEMBER THE FIRST. 90% OF ALL LANDLORDS REPRESENTED. ONLY 10% OF TENANTS REPRESENTED AND WE HAVE A FAIR FIGHT THE CHANCE OF A TENANT WHEN IN THAT CASE. DOUBLES AND TO ALL THE FOLKS THAT TESTIFIED TODAY I JUST WANNA SAY THANK YOU FOR TESTIFYING AND JUST FOR KICKS AS I LOOK AT. WHO A FEW FOLKS WHO FAILED THE BAR ONCE OR TWICE OR THREE TIMES A COUPLE OF INDIVIDUALS. THE FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES FDR. GOT A COUNTRY THROUGH WAR TO. FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE. HILLARY CLINTON. WHO FAIL THE DC BAR. A FORMER- FIRST LADY MICHELLE OBAMA FAILED ILLINOIS BAR A SPEAKER OF THIS HOUSE AND TONI VEHICLE ROSA FILL THE BAR AND I LOVE THIS LAST ONE TWO FORMER GOVERNORS RECENT GOVERNOR'S. PETE WILSON WHO FELL THREE TIMES AND I WANNA BE BIPARTISAN. OUR MOST RECENT AND GREAT GOVERNOR GOVERNOR JERRY BROWN THE FORMER ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THESE ARE ALL INDIVIDUALS WHO FAILED THE BAR. REDUCING A CUT SCORE SO THAT WERE STILL ONE OF THE TOP IN THE COUNTRY. WE NEED TO DO THIS. WITH DATA RECORDER HONEST ON THIS MEASURE IS- MR KILEY AND THE MISTER KALRA. THANK YOU MR STERN SO I THIS IS A YEAH I THINK PRESENTS AN INTERESTING ISSUE OF FAIRNESS AND- I THINK WHAT YOU'RE RECOMMENDING HERE GOES AGAINST NOT ONLY WHAT OUR SUPREME COURT HAS DECIDED THAT ALSO WOULD BE UNPRECEDENTED FOR. ANY STATE IS CHANGED ITS IT SCORE AND- I SORT OF I SEE I SEE THE ARGUMENT THAT IT'S SOMEWHAT ARBITRARY THAT IF YOU TOOK THE BAR LAST YEAR THEN YOU'RE HELD TO A MUCH HIGHER STANDARD THAN IF YOU TOOK IT THIS YEAR BUT- IT WOULD SEEM IS EQUALLY ARBITRARY THAT. IF YOU TOOK THE BAR SIX YEARS AGO THEN YOU'RE SUBJECT TO A HIGHER CUTS FOR THAT IF YOU TOOK A FIVE YEARS AGO AND SO I GUESS MY QUESTION IS. HOW DO YOU. WHAT WHAT IS YOUR CURRENT. FOR GUIDING WHAT'S FAIR HERE BECAUSE IT SEEMS TO ME. WHAT THE FAIREST THING MIGHT BE. IS SIMPLY FOR FOLKS THAT. IS TO RESPECT THE EXPECTATIONS OF PEOPLE WHEN THEY MADE THE DECISION TO TAKE THE BAR SO FOR FOLKS WHO TOOK THE BAR WHEN IT WAS THE OLD CUT SCORE THERE SHOULD BE SOMETHING THAT CUTS ARE. GONNA MAKE THE DECISION TO TAKE THE BAR NOW. WITH THE NEW CUTS FOR THE SHOULD BE CUT SUBJECT ABOUT WHY IS THAT. WHY IS THERE A BETTER CRITERIA FOR FAIRNESS THAN THAT. WELL THANK YOU AND YEAH I WILL POINT OUT I DID MISS. SPEAK THERE I HAVE ASKED THAT SEVERAL PEOPLE HAVE ASKED FOR. REGIONALLY FOR THIS RECORD. TO GO BACK FIVE YEARS WITH THIS RESOLUTION ASKS IS. UP TO FIVE YEARS BECAUSE I WASN'T SURE. THAT IS WHAT I WANT YOUR VOTES ON THIS END AND I WASN'T SURE THAT WOULD BE SATISFACTORY. THE REASON TO GO BACK. FIVE YEARS IS THAT'S ESSENTIALLY HOW LONG. THE REST OF THAT BAR. EXAM ARE. OUR VALUE GO BACK MUCH BEYOND THAT. THERE MAY NOT BE THE RECORD. AND THE SUPREME COURT COULD HE- CAN'T DO THAT CAN GO BACK FIVE YEARS IT TAKE THOSE. THOSE APPLICANTS THAT THAT'S WHY. THE FIVE YEARS. AND MY QUESTION WHAT WHEN WE LOOK AT. AFFAIRS QUESTION. IF THIRTEEN NINETY IS VALID GOING FORWARD. WHY WASN'T IT BALLOT FIVE YEARS AGO WHEN SENSE THAT FOR UP TO FIVE YEARS. IS A REASONABLE HORIZON TO LOOK AT I AGREE WITH YOU. SIX YEARS AGO. TEN YEARS AGO. WOULD THAT HAVE BEEN VALID YES BUT BUT AT SOME POINT WE HAVE TO CUT OFF LOWER THAN THIRTEEN NINETY I DON'T KNOW WE SAID ON THIRTEEN NINETY BECAUSE OF WHAT OTHER STATES HAVE DONE. AND HOURS AT FOURTEEN FORTY WAS JUST ARBITRARILY HIGH NEVER JUSTIFIED. THE QUESTION CAME UP ABOUT THE VALIDITY THE BAR EXAM ITSELF IS THAT THE MOST APPROPRIATE MEASURE. MY PERSONAL OPINION NO I WOULD RATHER THAT WE SEE MULTIPLE MEASURES OF BRINGING PEOPLE INTO THE PRACTICE OF LAW. SO EVEN IF WE SAID NOW IT'S BEEN SAID AT THIRTEEN NINETY WHAT IF SOMEBODY DID THIRTEEN EIGHTY NOT YOU CAN MAKE THAT ARGUMENT FOR THAT. YES THAT'S TRUE BUT IT NEEDS TO BE SET SOMEWHERE SINCE THE SUPREME COURT HAS TAKEN IT TO THIRTEEN NINETY NOW WHICH IS GOOD WE- I SUPPORT THAT AND- ASK FOR THAT NUMBER WAS THE BEST FOR THAT. BUT IT'S AGAIN ARBITRARY THAT IF YOU TOOK IT IN FEBRUARY OF LAST YEAR OR LAST YEAR OR THE PREVIOUS YEAR OR DURING THAT FIVE YEAR PERIOD. WHERE THE RECORD SHOULD EXIST AND THIS REPORT HAS THE AUTHORITY TO WELCOME THOSE. APPLICANTS INTO THE BAR I WOULDN'T ONLY. BECAUSE THE NEED IS NOW. AND THE CLEARLY DEMONSTRATED SCRIPTORIA FACT OF THAT HIGH CUT SCORE WE WOULD HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY OF WELCOMING MORE TURKEYS INTO THE PRACTICE. AT A TIME IS MR TWO POINTS OUT WE NEED THEM WE NEED THEM NOW I THINK WE'VE BEEN OVERLY. CAUTIOUS ABOUT WELCOMING PEOPLE IS WHAT WE HAVE AT OUR I WANT THIS RECORD TO LOOK AT RECIPROCITY. AS WELL. IF YOU CAN IF YOU'RE PASSED THE BAR IN ANOTHER STATE. WHY ARE WE SO HIGH AND MIGHTY THAT YOU CAN'T PRACTICE HERE. NOW MAYBE THERE ARE OTHER STATES WITH TOO LOW THE STANDARD I DON'T I DON'T WANT TO GET INTO THAT BUT THERE ARE PLENTY OF OTHER STATES WITH A HIGH ENOUGH STANDARDS. THAT I KNOW THEY WOULD BE COMPETENT EFFECTIVE ATTORNEYS THAT AND MOST OF PEOPLE CALLED IT. I WOULD WELCOME THEM. INTO THE BAR THOSE APPLICANTS. AT THIS LEVEL WE'RE JUST TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE CHANGING. THE DEMOGRAPHIC OF WHO'S PRACTICING LAW. AND MAKING MORE ATTORNEYS AVAILABLE IN THOSE COMMUNITIES WHO NEED THEM. THAT'S THE GOAL WILL HAVE DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THE ADEQUACY OF THE BAR EXAM WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE THAT. WE'LL HAVE DISCUSSIONS AROUND. RECIPROCITY WILL CONTINUE DISCUSSIONS ROUND EVERYTHING OUT. BUT FOR ME FOR THIS RECORD SAYING. WE'RE GONNA ALLOW PEOPLE GOING FORWARD WITH THE THIRTEEN NINETY. ONE NOT LAST YEAR'S ONE AT THE YEARS BEFORE AND THIS RESOLUTION JUST SAYS. LOOK BACK UP TO FIVE YEARS. BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT US TO ARGUE BUT IS A FIVE YEARS IT FOR YEARS. IS IT THREE YEARS I HAD A I WANT THEM TO LOOK AT THAT. AND THIS IS THE LEGISLATURE SAYING WE'RE THE LEGISLATURE WE CANNOT PASS A LAW HERE. WHICH WE CANNOT DO BECAUSE THIS THE CALIFORNIA BECAUSE YOU TO LEASE IT. JUST RECORD TO DO THAT BUT AS A BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT. THIS IS THE ONE OF THE BEST STATEMENTS WE CAN MAKE SING PLEASE LOOK AT THIS BECAUSE YOU HAVE A POOL OF HIGHLY QUALIFIED INDIVIDUALS. WHO COULD BE ATTORNEYS. AND COULD BE HELPING. THE VAST NEED UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES WE FIND THAT THAT'S- THAT'S RUSSIAN. YEAH YEAH NO I WON'T GO INTO ANY MORE LIKE THERE BUT I DON'T I DON'T THINK OF YOU AS A REASONABLE- I GUESS I JUST DISAGREE AS TO- THAT BEING THE BEST. STANDARD OF FAIRNESS HERE BUT ALSO JUST MENTION THAT I THINK THAT- I AGREE WITH YOU ON THE RECIPROCITY ISSUE I THINK WE NEED TO DO A LOT MORE THERE WITH THIS PROFESSION AND OTHERS SO I'D BE. VERY HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOU ON WE DO IT THANK YOU AND THAT'S YOU KNOW THAT'S YET ANOTHER STEP WHERE I THINK WE COULD IN A- HAVE A STRONGER. CORPS ATTORNEYS PRACTICING CALIFORNIA. ON THANK YOU MEMBERS MIND YOU ARE STILL SESSION AT ONE O'CLOCK. IT'S TO A THIRTY RIGHT NOW MR. GAP THIS IS A LAWYER'S ISSUE. THANK FULL LAWYERS. SIMILAR. THANK YOU. THE YOU MISTER AND I AND I WILL BE TO CALL I APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE DOING HERE I THINK IT ALL SPEAKS I THINK THAT WE'RE JUST COMING MORE TO THE NORM BEEN AT ONE EXTREME I THINK COMING BACK TO THE NORMS IMPORTANT ESPECIALLY RECOGNIZING- WHEN I TOOK THE BAR VERY LONG TIME AGO I HAD THE LUXURY TO BE ABLE TO STUDY FULL TIME A LOT WHO DON'T HAVE THAT LUXURY BUT ALSO IMPACTS TO SCORE DOESN'T ACTUALLY MEAN THEY'RE GOING TO THEIR CORE ANY MORE OR LESS QUALIFIED TO BE A LAWYER AND I THINK THIS RECOGNIZES. THAT THAT'S ACCOUNT FOR THAT IS DURING THE CRAZY TIMES TO YOUR POINT DOESN'T MAKE MUCH SENSE OF WE'RE SAYING THANK YOU THIRTEEN NINETY IS A NOW BUT WAS OKAY SIX AGO OR A YEAR BUT BUT I THE FACT THAT YOU SAVE UP TO BUY YEARS TO GET% THAT SPUR TO HAVE THAT KIND WITH THE SUPREME. BUT CONTROLS RESTRICTIONS THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND- MISTER IS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER CHAIR FOR BRING IN FORWARD SO I'M OF SO MANY OF THOSE STUDENTS THAT FINISHED LAW SCHOOL THEY WENT THROUGH THEIR THREE FOUR YEARS WHATEVER TOOK THEM I'M JUST GLAD THAT WE ARE STANDING UP FOR THEM THEY HAVE DONE ALL THEIR STUDYING THEY'VE TAKEN ALL THE CLASSES THEY PASSED ALL THEIR CLASSES. AND ARE READY TO TAKE THE BAR- TO BE TO GIVE THEM THIS OPPORTUNITY I THINK IS A GREAT AND I WELCOME ALL THOSE NEW ATTORNEYS IT WILL BE COMING IN I'VE HEARD FROM MANY OF THEM AND I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO HAVING THEM PRACTISE LAW HELPING OUR COMMUNITY. THANK YOU. YES MR HOLDEN MISTER HAIR I SUPPORT THIS BILL BUT FOR ALL THOSE YOUNG PEOPLE WHO NEVER WENT TO LAW SCHOOL LIKE MYSELF YOU TOO CAN SERVE ON THE PURCHASER. IN YOUR WELCOME. ANY OTHER LAWYERS WISHING TO SPEAK ON THIS BILL. OKAY I DO STRUGGLE WITH A LITTLE BIT I FULLY SYMPATHIZE WITH- YOU KNOW SOMEONE WHO TOOK THE BAR- WHAT THIRTEEN YEARS AGO NOW- WHEN IT WAS THREE DAYS BY THE WAY- BUT. YOU KNOW IT IS A VERY TOUGH AND CHALLENGING TESTS AND ALSO SOMEONE WHO HAS CLOSE FRIENDS AND FAMILY AND VERY CLOSE FAMILY MEMBERS WHO TOOK THE BAR MULTIPLE TIMES. BEFORE FINALLY PASSING. THE TOUGH THING FOR ME IS IT IS THAT REALLY FAIR WORK I MEAN. I GET WHY KATE WHY YOU SET THE FIVE YEARS BUT- YOU CAN GO ALL THE WAY BACK AND MANY PEOPLE TOOK IT SEVERAL TIMES BUT PERSISTED AND PASS PASSED THE BAR. I DON'T KNOW THAT WE'RE BEING FAIR T THOSE FOLK WHO. WHO BASICALLY DID HAVE TO KEEP TAKING IT UNTIL THEY PASSED WE SET OUT A YOU KNOW WE SAID A PROFICIENCY IT AT SOME LEVEL. WE JUST WE JUST TALKED ABOUT A BILL ABOUT SETTING STANDARDS AND SETTING PROFICIENCIES AND- AND ACCOUNTABILITY YOU HAVE TO DO IT AT SOME LEVEL. WHY WOULD WE CHANGE THAT KIND OF ARBITRARILY AND RETROACTIVELY. IN ONE IN ONE SECTOR THAT PROFESSION I. I THINK THAT SENDS A MIXED MESSAGE BUT I DO AGREE WITH YOU THAT YOU KNOW ESPECIALLY ON RECIPROCITY WHERE WE DOING STUFF FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE ACTUALLY ALREADY DEMONSTRATED THEIR PROFICIENCY. IN ANOTHER STATE AND YET WE'RE NOT DOING ANYTHING FOR THEM RIGHT NOW. WE'RE SAYING YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO TAKE THE BAR AGAIN WHENEVER WHENEVER THEY HOLD IT. AND SO PEOPLE WHO HAVE MOVED HERE FROM OTHER STATES HAVE PASSED BARS AND OTHER STATES. ARE UNABLE TO PRACTICE LAW EVEN THOUGH THEY'VE BEEN PRACTICING LAW- MAYBE FOR YEARS IN ANOTHER STATE. WE'RE SENDING A MIXED MESSAGE TO THEM AS WELL I MEAN THAT'S NOT VERY I DON'T SEE THAT AS BEING FAIR UNLESS WE'RE GOING TO DO THIS FOR EVERYONE. ACROSS THE BOARD IT DOESN'T STRIKE ME AS BEING A FAIR. RESOLUTION OF THE PROBLEM. BUT I BUT AGAIN I DO SYMPATHIZE WITH. YOU KNOW. MANY HAVE TAKEN IT AND WE'RE NW WE'RE CHANGING THE SCORE. IT DOES SEEM. YOU KNOW. YOU KNOW FOR GONNA CHANGE THE SCORE AND THEN AND THEN TELL PEOPLE THAT. THE TEAM THAT SCORED JUST AS RECENTLY AS FEBRUARY THAT YOU YOU STILL CAN'T PRACTICE. I SEE THAT BUT IT'S A STRUGGLE IT'S GOT TO BE A FAIR PROCESS I THINK FOR EVERYBODY WHO SIMILARLY SITUATED. AND THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE SIMILARLY SITUATED. AND I HAVE A HARD TIME JUST SAYING HEY WE'RE GONNA DO THIS JUST FOR ONE GROUP. AND NOT FOR OTHERS WHO ARE ALSO IN THE SAME- BALLPARKS SO- I WILL ALLOW YOU TO CLOSE THE MISTER CHAIR- WELL WELL. WELL THANK YOU EIGHT CAN'T. YOU KNOW IF THAT'S YOUR WORRY. WHY NOT THIS WE'VE WE'VE ASKED FOR UP TO FIVE YEARS THAT IN FIVE YEARS IS REALLY WHERE THE RECORDS GO WHICH IS WHY WE'VE GOT SOME TO LOOK AT THAT. BECAUSE THIS REPORT CAN GO BACK FIVE YEARS AND GRANT SOMEBODY THE ABILITY TO ME THAT THAT'S WHAT THEY DO NOW. ATTENTION LEE. THE ABILITY TO PRACTICE LAW GOING BACK BEYOND THAT. THEY MAY NOT EVEN HAVE THE RECORDS SO I WANT TO ASK THEMIN THIS. THIS IS A COMPONENT ABOUT IT RECIPROCITY IS A DIFFERENT ISSUE. THIS WILL APPLY TO EVERYBODY TAKING THE BAR. AND ACROSS THE BOARD GOING BACK TO A REASONABLE POINT WHERE THE PARK SHOULD HAVE THOSE RECORDS AND BE ABLE TO FACILITATE. MAKING THIS HAPPEN IF YOU WANT TO ADD YOUR VOICE WE'VE BEEN ASKING THE BAR TO LOOK AT RECIPROCITY AND ANY NUMBER OF THINGS. TO BRING PEOPLE INTO THE PRACTICE OF LAW WHO WE DESPERATELY NEED TO BE HERE NOW. AND SO THE CUT SCORE WAS ARBITRARY. THE FIVE YEARS IS NOT REALLY BECAUSE THAT'S A RECORDS ISSUE AND I THINK ONE OF THINGS WE MAY FIND OUT IS THE BAR MAY NOT EVEN HAVE ADEQUATE RECORDS. GOING BACK THAT FIVE YEARS THAT MIGHT BE A CHALLENGE FOR THEM AND I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING WE'RE GONNA NEED TO LOOK AT IF THAT'S THE CASE BUT THAT'S A REASONABLE ASK OF THE BAR. GIVEN RECORD LIMITATIONS GIVEN KIND OF HOW THOSE PROCESSES WORK IS TO LOOK AT WHAT THEY CAN DO WITHIN THAT FIVE YEARS. OTHER CATEGORIES YES WE NEED TO WORK ON IT THAT'S NOT WHAT WE'RE ADDRESSING HERE THIS IS ONE SIMPLE THING BECAUSE THE CUT SCORES ARBITRARY AND THEY DECIDED TO BE THE THIRTEEN NINETY WE'VE BEEN PUSHING FOR THAT BECAUSE OF. MAKING IT A RELATIVE IN AND IS EQUITABLE ACROSS WHAT OTHER STATES HAVE DONE THAT'S HOW WE'VE ARRIVED AT THOSE NUMBERS. ME BACK INTO THINKING HE IMPARTED QUILL DAYS WHEN I TOOK THE BAR WAS A THREE DAY TWO BAR AND I HAVE ALWAYS SAID IT'S JUST A THREE DAY STRESS TEST. AND YOU KNOW WHEN WE WITH THOSE LARGER STUDY FOR THE BAR THEY TOLD US VERY CLEARLY YOU LEARN. AS A LAWYER YOU JEWELERS THREE VERY DIFFERENT TYPES OF LAW THAT HAVE ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO DO WITH EACH OTHER. WHAT YOU STUDYING LAW SCHOOL. WHAT YOU STUDY TO TAKE THE BAR EXAM AND THEN WHAT YOU DO IN ACTUAL PRACTICE. THERE'S NOT REALLY ANY RELATION BETWEEN ANY OF THOSE THREE. THE WHOLE THING'S ARMATURE. THE WHOLE THING IS NOT NECESSARILY HOPEFULLY MITIGATING WHO'S GOING TO BE A GOOD PRACTITIONER OF LAW. OR NOT. THAT DOES NEED TO BE LOOKED AT BEYOND WHAT WE'RE ASKING HERE. THIS IS A SIMPLE STATEMENT OF SUPREME COURT PLEASE TAKE A LOOK YOU HAVE AN EASY RELIEF VALVE. TO SIGNIFICANT SITUATION RIGHT HERE WHY DON'T YOU TAKE IT THAT'S ALL THIS RESOLUTION DOES AND I ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS.
