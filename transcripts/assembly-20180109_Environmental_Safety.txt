PRESIDENT QUIRK IS PRESENT CHEN. CAN IS HERE. BUT AYE-MOORLACH. AND. WROTE BIRD WAS HERE. YOU SEE THAT UPSET. HOLDEN. MURATSUCHI WE HAVE ACQUIRED. ALRIGHT SHOWS I AM PRESENTING. I'D LIKE TO ASK A VICE CHAIR. CHAN TO COME OVER. AND CITY AREAS AS CHAIR. WELL I PRESENT THANK YOU DOCTOR AMBULANCE. IF YOU DR. RICHARD REPORTER. THANK YOU MR VICE CHAIR. AND THEN THANK YOU MEMBERS. PAGE SEVEN OF THE ANALYSIS A RECOMMENDS TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS THAT I SHALL TAKE TIME ACCEPTING ADDITIONALLY. I'M ACCEPTING AMENDMENTS THAT PROVIDE MORE DIRECTION REGARDING WHAT THE. DIRECTOR CAN TAKE OVER A CASE I'M ACCEPTING BOTH ITS AUTHORS AMENDMENTS. THOSE AMENDMENTS ABOUT WHEN THE DIRECTOR WOULD TO A TAKEOVER CASE ARE. A DIRECT RESULT OF CONCERNS THAT THE FARM BUREAU AND OTHER FARMING INTERESTS HAD. WE ARE STILL WORKING ON THE FINAL. WE'VE GOT SOME LANGUAGE IN THERE STATE WERE STILL WORKING TO FINALIZE IT BUT THIS IS A GOOD START AND THEY'VE GIVEN US SOME ALTERNATIVE LANGUAGE. WILL CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS. AB FOURTEEN NINETEEN WILL PROVIDE THE DEPARTMENT OF PESTICIDE REGULATION AUTHORITY. MORE AUTHORITY TO ENFORCE THE STATE'S A PESTICIDE USE LAW FOR SERIOUS VIOLATIONS. RECENTLY THERE BEEN A LARGE NUMBER OF SERIOUS CASES OF PESTICIDE DRIFT. IT IF NEGATIVE NEGATIVELY IF IMPACTED YOU MINUTE WILDLIFE HEALTH. ACROSS JURISDICTIONAL VIOLATIONS HAVE BEEN DIFFICULTY A TO ENFORCE BECAUSE COUNTY AGRICULTURAL COMMISSIONERS. HAVE LIMITED THORNY TO SITE FOR OR VIOLATIONS THAT EXTEND OUTSIDE THEIR BOUNDARIES. FURTHER ADDING TO THE DIFFICULTY OF ENFORCEMENT IS SET THE MAXIMUM PENALTY THE CAN BE LEVEL FOR VIOLATIONS. HAS NOT INCREASED IN FIFTEEN YEARS. UP MY BILL STRENGTH THE SIDES ARE PESTICIDE USE LAWS IN THE FOLLOWING WAYS. FIRST IT GIVES THE DEPARTMENT OF PESTICIDE REGULATION MORE ADMINISTRATIVE AUTHORITY TO TAKE ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS AGAINST SERIOUS CASES ANOTHER WORDS WHEN THEY'RE. R. HEALTH CONSEQUENCES ARE WHEN THEY'RE ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES SUCH AS. POLLUTING THEIR DRINKING WATER SOURCE WHEN THERE'S SOMETHING VERY SERIOUS. A SECOND THE APARTMENT INSTEAD OF HAVING THE ABILITY TO LEVEL A FINE OF FIVE THOUSAND IS RAISED TO TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND. A THIRD IT ALLOWS SPEAK COUNTY AGRICULTURAL COMMISSIONERS TO REFER CASES SUCH AS WHEN THERE'S A CONFLICT OF INTEREST TO THE DEPARTMENT. HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT ARE TWO MEMBERS OF THE DEPARTMENT OF PESTICIDE REGULATION. KIM'S CHAIR. BUT MY NAME IS THERESA MARKS AND I'M THE CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT PESTICIDE REGULATION. WE ARE SEEKING PASSAGE OF AB FOURTEEN NINETEEN BECAUSE IT WOULD GIVE A STATE GREATER TOOLS. TWO UP PROTECT PUBLIC HEALTH AND THE ENVIRONMENT BY ALLOWING DPR TO LET THE CIVIL PENALTIES AND SOME OF THE MORE EGREGIOUS CASES. YOU KNOW THE DEPARTMENT'S MISSION IS TO PROTECT HUMAN HEALTH AND THE ENVIRONMENT BY REGULATING PESTICIDES SALES IN USE IN FOSTERING REDUCED RISK PEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES. THE STATE HAS A VERY ROBUST REGULATORY PROGRAM AND WE WORK WITH OUR COUNTY AGRICULTURAL COMMISSIONERS TO ENSURE THAT PESTICIDE APPLICATORS ARE LICENSED PROFESSIONALS AND PESTICIDES ARE LEGALLY APPLIED. WHILE MOST PESTICIDE APPLICATIONS ARE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE LAW THERE ARE STILL SOME APPLICATIONS THAT RESULT IN VIOLATION AND AND A PORTION OF THOSE THAT CAUSE HUMAN HEALTH CONCERNS ARE SIGNIFICANT ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE. AND THOSE ARE THE CASES WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TODAY THESE INCIDENTS TRIGGER PRIORITY INVESTIGATION IN THE COUNTY AGRICULTURAL COMMISSIONER CONCURRENTLY LEVY A MAXIMUM FINE OF FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS PER VIOLATION. DP R. BELIEVES THAT SOME PRIORITY INVESTIGATION CASES WARRANT HIGHER PENALTY AMOUNT. OF COURSE THERE ARE ALSO CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE IT WOULD BE INAPPROPRIATE FOR THE COUNTY AYE COMMISSIONERS TO TAKE AN ACTION. OF THOSE WOULD BE THINGS IF YOU HAVE A MULTIPLE JURISDICTIONS MULTIPLE COUNTY JURISDICTIONS ARE THERE'S A CONFLICT OF INTEREST. AYE NDP R. WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO ASSIST THE CICS WINDOW SITUATIONS ARISE ALSO. WE'VE BEEN IN CONVERSATIONS WITH THE COUNTY AGRICULTURAL COMMISSIONERS A WE ARE WORKING WITH HIM ON MAKING SURE THAT THE LANGUAGE. IS IS SOMETHING THAT I FEEL VERY COMFORTABLE WITH WE CONSIDER THE COUNTY AGRICULTURAL COMMISSIONERS ARE PARTNERS. I IN OUR IN MEETING OUR GOALS AND WE CERTAINLY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT. WE ARE WORKING IN HARMONY WITH THEM OUT WITH THIS NEW REGULATION ARE WITH THIS NEW LAW SKIS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND WE APPRECIATE YOUR SUPPORT. JUST HERE TO HELP ANSWER QUESTIONS. I AM BILL I'LL YOU KNOW FOR ENVIRONMENTAL WORKING GROUP ALSO. SAME SUPPORT FROM BREAST CANCER PREVENTION PARTNERS AND PISSED PESTICIDE ACTION NETWORK THANK YOU. DO YOU HAVE ANY ANY OTHER WITNESS IN SUPPORT. YES GOOD AFTERNOON I'M ADAM AND COTTON FROM CALIFORNIA RURAL LEGAL ASSISTANCE FOUNDATION AND ALSO HERE REPRESENTING PESTICIDE ACTION NETWORK TODAY. AND WE ARE ALSO VERY MUCH IN SUPPORT IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO HAVE EFFECTIVE INVESTIGATIONS ARE. TIMELY. AND THAT RIG RESULT IN STIFF FINES WHEN THERE ARE SERIOUS ON. SERIOUS PROP UP. WHEN THERE IS A HUMAN ILLNESS HER SERIOUS ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS AND WE THINK THIS BILL IS A. GOOD STEP TO ENSURE EFFECTIVE INVESTIGATING YOU THINK. MR TURN MEMBERS NOT USE I REALLY GOING TO HAVE THE CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURAL COMMISSIONER SINCE YOU'RE DISSOCIATION. I LISTENED CAREFULLY TO THAT TESTIMONY FROM DP ON THE AUTHOR REFLECTS EVERYTHING WE UNDERSTAND ABOUT THIS BILL MOVING FORWARD. I WE CAN WORKING WITH THEM SINCE LAST YEAR AND A LITTLE MORE TENSE IN THE PAST COUPLE WEEKS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE ALL ON THE SAME PAGE AS TO HOW THIS PROCESS WILL WORK. WE HAD A A QUICK LOOK AT THE AMENDMENTS THAT WERE PROVIDED TO US LAST NIGHT. I'D FEEL IF YOU TAKE A HUGE STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION OUR DISTRIBUTING THOSE THROUGHOUT OUR ASSOCIATION WHILE THAT POSITION ON THAT SHORTLY. HOPEFULLY I HAVE A LIEU MENDOZA WITH ME WHO IS A AND I COMMISSIONER FROM YOU COUNTY. REPRESENTING THE ASSOCIATION AS WELL FOR ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW THIS PROCESS WORKS THINKING. OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. ANYONE IS IN OPPOSITION FOR YOUR SUPPORT YEAH. DANICA OFTEN ALSO ON BEHALF OF THE BREAST CANCER PREVENTION PARTNERS IN SUPPORT THINK YOU. THE WORK HAVE TO CLEAR IT CHAIR. JUST ONE FACTOR THAT WE HAVE TWO PEOPLE IN OPPOSITION SO. AND NOW FOR WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. YEAH COME ON UP. CHAIRMAN MEMBERS CYNTHIA CORY WITH THE CALIFORNIA FARM BUREAU. I APPRECIATE ASSEMBLYMEMBERS A QUIRKS WORKING WITH US ON ON THE ON THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS WHICH WE ALSO SAW FOR THE FIRST TIME LAST NIGHT. THEY WERE THEY WE HAD SUGGESTED SOME LANGUAGE AND AS MATT SAID EARLIER WITH THE AG COMMISSIONERS WE'VE COME A LONG WAY TOWARDS GETTING THERE. ON OUR CONCERN WAS NOT THAT BE THEY WANTED REINSERT THIS LANGUAGE WHICH WAS AT FORMALLY IN STATUTE IT WAS OF THE COSTA BILL IN TWO THOUSAND. BUT THAT THE WAY IT WAS WRITTEN WAS GONNA GIVE A. IT WAS GONNA EXCERPTED THE AUTHORITY OF THE AGRICULTURAL COMMISSIONERS THE WAY IT WAS WRITTEN SO WE HAD CONCERNS ABOUT THAT WE ASK THAT THAT BE CLARIFIED. SO THE LANGUAGE THAT WE WERE GIVEN LAST NIGHT I JUST THINK IN AND WE TALKED ABOUT THIS IN AND I THINK WOMEN TALKED ABOUT IT WITH THE PAIR BUT WE HAVEN'T TALKED ABOUT IT WITH THIS SIMPLY MEMBER. ON I JUST THINK THAT HE'S BE A LITTLE BIT MORE CLARIFICATION AGAIN THAT IT'S THE COUNTY THAT MAKES A DETERMINATION IF THEY'VE GOT A CONFLICT OF INTEREST OR IF THEY CAN'T AFFORD TO HANDLE IT. WE JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE COUNTY HAS THE FIRST CHOICE BECAUSE THAT THERE THAT THERE THE REGULATORS AT THE COUNTY LEVEL NAY SHOULD MAINTAIN THAT UNTIL THEY THEY ASK. FOR ASSISTANCE FROM. FROM THE FROM THE DEPARTMENT AND THERE IS PRECEDENT FOR THAT IN IN ENFORCEMENT POLICY WHICH I ALSO SHARED WITH ASSEMBLYMEMBER QUIRK. ON WITH THE SECOND THING THAT WE ALSO ASK FOR WE GOT CONCERNED ABOUT GOING FROM FIVE TO TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND ONE JUMP. FARM BUREAU SUPPORTED THE ASSEMBLYMEMBER HANNAH BETH JACKSON SPILL WE WERE THE ONLY MAINSTREAM AT GROUP THAT DID AND I WORK CLOSELY WITH HANNAH BETH ON THAT. AND WE WENT FROM THERE FROM ONE TO FIVE THOUSAND AND. I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE WE WE VAST DPR LIKE OKAY WOULD SHOW US THE MONEY WAIT WAIT WHERE'S THAT VIOLATIONS THAT THAT WOULD SAY WE NEED GO FROM FIVE TO TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND. PROVIDE ELATION YOU'VE GOT THE AUTHORITY A LOT OF DIFFERENT PLACES IF YOU'RE ALREADY DOING ANYTHING TO HURT HEALTH OR THE ENVIRONMENT TO TO GO THAT FAR. SO WE'VE JUST ASKED THAT THAT BE TALKED ABOUT AND MAYBE THAT WE CONSIDER CERTAIN SOMETHING MORE OF A MIDDLE GROUND WE SUGGEST A TEN THOUSAND. SO THOSE ARE THE CONCERNS WE HAVE SO AT THIS POINT WE CAN'T. SUPPORT THE BILL WE'VE GOT YOU SAY WERE IN CONCERN AND WE'RE HOPING TO GET TO WHERE WE CAN SUPPORT THE BILL. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN BECAUSE OF THE COMMISSION BORN KNOWING TEACHER COME BEHALF OF WESTERN PLANT HEALTH ASSOCIATION WERE IN THE SAME POSITION AS. FARM BUREAU JUST STATED CONCERNED. WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR AND REALLY APPRECIATE. WHAT HE'S DONE SO FAR AND MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION AND MAKING SURE THAT THE COUNTY? MAINTAINS THAT AUTHORITY. SO WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR BUT AT THIS POINT CAN'T SUPPORT THE BILL THANK YOU. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE HOME OVER THE QUESTIONS FOR IDEA CAMINO NERVES. ANY QUESTIONS. CONSUMERS USUALLY THANK YOU. SO I'M READING THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS THE. ARE ON THE ISSUE OF THE PENALTY IT'S IT'S NOT MORE THAN TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND I CORRECT THAT'S GREAT OKAY SO IT Vl BE LESS. AND. I WOULD LEAVE IT UP TO THE. DEPARTMENT TO TALK ABOUT YEAH WHEN IT WOULD BE MORE LESS OKAY AND IN TERMS OF FOR. THE DEPARTMENTS. DISCRETION AND. ARMED INVESTIGATING AND AND. LOVING. I I I I BELIEVE THEIR THEIR IS A A PROCESS FOR APPEAL. A IN IN TERMS OF. NOW WITH THE DEPARTMENT INTO THAT OKAY. I GUESS FOR THERE IS A PROCESS FOR APPEAL AND AS FAR AS THE TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS GOES THE. THAT. THE CASES THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT OF SOME OF THOSE MOST EGREGIOUS CASES. THERE MAYBE SITUATION WHERE YOU MIGHT ONLY HAVE A ONE PERSON INVOLVED BUT WAS THERE WAS A SERIOUS ILLNESS CAUSED. OR THERE COULD BE SIGNIFICANT ENVIRONMENTAL HARM THAT WOULD WARRANT THAT. UP BUT AGAIN THAT THERE IS A. THERE'S THAT POSITION WHERE IT'S UP TO TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND SO IT CERTAINLY DOESN'T MEAN THAT THAT WOULD BE IT WHAT WE WOULD SEEK IN EVERY CASE. YEAH I AS FAR AS THE PROCEDURAL ASPECT GOES. RIGHT NOW. WHEN THE CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURAL COMMISSIONERS A HEARING PERSON REQUEST A HEARING AND THEN AFTER THAT HEARING THAT CAN ALSO REQUEST AN APPEAL TO THE DIRECTOR'S OFFICE. IT WOULD BE A SIMILAR SITUATION THE PERSONAL IF WE BROUGHT THAT THE VIOLATION THE PERSON COULD REQUEST A HEARING WE HAVE OUR OWN ADMINISTRATIVE HEARING OFFICER IN COURSE WE COULD USE PROBABLY THE COUNTY ADMINISTRATIVE HEARING OFFICER TO YOU WE WOULD HAVE A HEARING. AND THE APPEAL FROM THERE WE GO DIRECTLY TO THE COURTS. AND AND SO YOU SAY THAT TO THIS SHOULD BE. OF THIS PROCESS BE GAUGED ONLY THE MOST EGREGIOUS OF CASES THAT HOW WOULD. LED THE RESPONDENT CHALLENGE WHETHER THIS IS EGREGIOUS OR NOT. WELL I MEAN I THINK THAT THE WHITE PROBABLY THEY ALWAYS WOULD WE I'M WHEN I SAY IT THAT CERTAINLY THE MOST EGREGIOUS CASES BUT ALSO THOSE OTHER CASES WHERE THERE COULD BE A CONFLICT OF INTEREST FOR THAT KIND OF STUFF BUT. THE EGREGIOUS CASES WE LOOK AT ARE THOSE WHERE THERE'S BEEN SIGNIFICANT HARM. IT WHERE THERE ARE THOSE WHERE THERE'S BEEN A SITUATION WHERE FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS DOES NOT. IS NOT WARRANTED THERE THERE'S JUST OUT THERE IS ACTION TO THE POINT WHERE WOODS WORN A MORE SIGNIFICANT PENALTY. I GUESS WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR IS THE DUE PROCESS IN TERMS OF THE RESPONDENTS ABILITY TO. TO. YOU KNOW NOT JUST RELY ON THE DEPARTMENT'S DETERMINATION OF WHAT CONSTITUTES EGREGIOUS BUT. YOU KNOW WILL WHAT KIND OF A DUE PROCESS IS THERE IN TERMS OF RESPOND. EQUIP US ASSISTANT DIRECTOR FOR DPR. IN TERMS OF THIS BILL WE ACTUALLY OUT A CRITERIA WHICH WE IDENTIFIES THE PARTY INVEST INVESTIGATION CRITERIA. THAT IS LAID OUT THROUGH A MEMORANDUM UNDERSTANDING WITH US USEPA AND. THE COUNTY AG COMMISSIONERS AND SECRETARY DOES LAYOUTS. WHAT'S THE THRESHOLDS IN WHICH SOMETHING COULD BE CONSIDERED A PRIORITY INVESTIGATION OF THOSE WOULD BE CASES WHERE. HUMAN HEALTH WAS INVOLVED LARGE ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE THINGS LIKE THAT AND IT THIS LAYOUT THAT CREEK AREA OKAY. AND AND LAST QUESTION IS. THE PENALTIES FOR EACH VIOLATION. IN IN THE CASE OF LIKE SAY. ARE A. BETH SIGHED INCIDENT THEN THAT EXTENDS OVER. SEVERAL DAYS. THIS ACT. IT IS AT AND HOW IS EACH. INCIDENT DEFINED. THAT THE. THE INCIDENT WOULD BE. WOULD BE. THE WAY IT WOULD BE. UPGRADING TO MORE THAN ONE WOULD BE IF YOU HAVE MORE THAN ONE PERSON WAS INJURED OKAY. SO IN. IF ANY OF IN A BID TO IT TYPICALLY WHEN YOU HAVE A PESTICIDE ILLNESS IT'S USUALLY AT AN ACUTE PASS I KNOW THIS WORD IT'S AN OCCASION HAPPENS. IT WITHIN ONE DAY OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT SO. BUT IT HELPS BUT IF THERE'S BUT THE THE NUMBER OF INCIDENTS TO BE CHARGED. FOR PENALTY TO BE CHARGED DEPENDS ON THE NUMBER OF VICTIMS. YEAH WE WOULD HAVE THAT ABILITY TO AT EACH I TO SS EVERY. INDIVIDUAL PERSON AS A SEPARATE VIOLATION. I THINK. THANK YOU. GARCIA. I THINK YOU'RE DO YOU WANT TO MOVE THE BILL. AND. I WANT TO THANK MR QUIRKS WORK TO GET THE AMENDMENTS AND ALL AND WORKING WITH THE OPPOSITION. ON THIS. REALLY QUICKLY ON THE. HOW WE LANDED ON THE TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLAR AMOUNTS IS MY QUESTION AND THEN BE? THERE'S NO INDEX FOR THIS TO BE ADJUSTED AUTOMATICALLY IN THE FUTURE AT ANY POINT BUT SAY. THIS IS LAST I THINK IN THE SEVENTIES OF THE LEFT HAND OF NUMBER WITH THE JUST THAT. WE HAVE TO HAVE TO COME BACK THAT WAY AND HAS SAID HAVE LEAF CONSIDER SOME SORT OF FOR INDEX OCHOA. ON THIS FINE. AND I WOULD ARGUE WITH YOUR DEPARTMENT THAT. WE BASICALLY DID THIS KIND OF ESSENTIALLY THE SAME WAY IT WAS DONE IN TWO THOUSAND FIVE WE WENT FROM WE GET A FIVE FOLD INCREASE. ON THE FINE IT WENT FROM ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS TO FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS SUDDENLY GET THIS FIVE FOLD INCREASE IN WE DO FEEL LIKE THAT IT'S NECESSARY. TO TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE A SIGNIFICANT DETERRENT EFFECT. ON THESE PARTICULARLY EGREGIOUS AYE ISSUES UP WE HAVE NOT CONSIDERED THAT WE'VE NOT EVEN DISCUSSED AMONG OURSELVES I THINK ANY TYPE OF OF. PERIODIC. REVIEW. AND WE COULD CERTAINLY AS WE TALK WITH THE OPPOSITION. THAT'S CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT WE COULD DISCUSS. I AM NOT COMMITTING INTO ANYTHING EVELYN CURIOUS JUST BECAUSE I KEEP. DO THE JAPANESE HEAPS INFLOWS COMING BACK TO ADJUST AND IN THE HIGH MINUTES JUST TO THAT SINCE THE SEVENTIES OR. WHATEVER THAT MAY BE AND SO I JUST YOU KNOW WONDER IF. IF WE NEED TO KEEP REVISITING OF THIS A PLAN THAT WE JUST AT. AN INDEX BUT I'M NOT COMMITTING YOU TWENTY THING NOW THINKING AND BUT IT'S CERTAINLY SOMETHING WE CAN DISCUSS. BUT ONE OF THE FIRST START BY THANKING THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD HAVING WORKED IN ANY ARE IN A FORM WORKING COMMUNITY I SAW MORE THAN MY FAIR SHARE OF PESTICIDE EXPOSURES. FROM. AND YET I DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THE BILL AND WANTED TO SHARE A FEW OF THEM IF I COULD. HER FIRST MIGHT CONCERN USUALLY STEMS FROM TAKING AWAY LOCAL CONTROL. AND REALLY WANTED TO DO A LOT A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE AG COMMISSIONERS AND THEIR ROLE AND PARTNERSHIP. IN THIS. WE MADE AN ATTEMPT TO CALL MY FRESNO AG COMMISSIONER LESS RIGHTS TO ASK HIS OPINION OF THE BILL AND HE WAS NOT. WILLING YET TO GET TO A PLACE OF SUPPORT. TO EARN MY SUPPORT I LIKE MY LOCALS TELLING ME. THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT THEY WANT AND NEED A TOOL THAT WOULD HELP THEM IN SO. I'M TRYING TO ASK FROM YOU DO YOU ANTICIPATE AT SOME POINT THROUGH THE PROCESS OF THIS TO OFFICIALLY GET THE AG COMMISSIONERS IN SUPPORT. THAT'S THE QUESTION UP BUT THE STATEMENT I NEED TO MAKE IS TODAY I AM MOST LIKELY NOT GOING TO VOTE ON THIS ISSUE BEFORE US. MOSTLY BECAUSE OF. THE FINE ITSELF. NOW WHILE I HEAR THE FIVE FOLD INCREASE I THANK YOU CAN ALWAYS PLAY WITH NUMBERS YOU CAN ALSO SAY THAT GOING FROM ONE THOUSAND FIVE THOUSAND WAS A FOUR THOUSAND DOLLAR INCREASE. SO WHY WE INCREASING ANOTHER FOUR THOUSAND TO GET US CLOSER TO THE TEN THOUSAND NUMBER THAT WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER. SO AYE WANT. ASK AND I'M HOPING THAT EVENTUALLY WE CAN GET THE AG COMMISSIONERS ON BOARD AS A WAY FOR THOSE OF US WHO. ARE STRADDLING THE FENCE NOW TO SEE IF WE COULD SUPPORT THE BILL. BUT AND HOPING THAT WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THIS ISSUE FORWARD WE FIND A WAY WITH THAT FINE. TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR LOCAL CONTROL IS STILL THERE. YEAH. SHOW IN RESPONSE TO THAT AND AT FIRST OF ALL YOUR COUNTY COMMISSION WOULD OF SEEN THE LATEST AMENDMENT SO. UP PRIOR TO THE LATEST AMENDMENT IF SOME IT SAID THAT THE. ARM. APARTMENT COULD TAKE OVER CERTAIN CASES BUT DIDN'T SPECIFY. R. UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS THAT WAS WHAT WAS PUT IN HERE. WHAT THE OPPOSITION CONCERNED ABOUT ON THAT AMENDMENT WAS JUST MAKING IT MORE CLEAR WHO DETERMINES WHEN THERE'S A VIOLATION? I CHOOSE ME WHEN THERE'S A CONFLICT OF INTEREST AND WHO DETERMINES IF THE DEPARTMENT DOESN'T HAVE ADEQUATE. OUR RESOURCES AND ARE MAKING THAT CLEAR DOES THE DEPARTMENT TO HAVE A POSITION THAT THEY. HAVE YOU JUST. THOUGHT ABOUT THIS YET. HOW THEY CLARIFY THAT LANGUAGE? WE ARE CONTINUING TO WORK WITH THE COUNTY AGRICULTURAL COMMISSIONERS BUT I THINK WE CAN CLARIFY THAT LANGUAGE TO THEIR. THEIR UP. AGREEMENT I WEEK BELIEVING WE HAVE NO DESIRE TO USURP THEIR AUTHORITY OR TO TAKE WE ANY CASES AWAY FROM THEM PARTICULARLY WHAT WE WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS TO. PUT PROVIDE ASSISTANCE TO THEM IN SITUATIONS WHERE THEY HAD DIFFICULTY WITH THE GUYS. AND I'M HAPPY IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK WITH THEIR. REPRESENTATIVE BEGAN. YEAH SURE PLEASE. PLEASE COME UP. THANK YOU SO A NUMBER. AS STATED LET'S HASN'T SEEN THE LANGUAGE FROM. FROM LAST NIGHT I DID SEND IT TO HIM AND EVERYONE ELSE IN ASSOCIATION AND WAITING ON A RESPONSE WHAT FROM THAT. AS FAR AS AS DP OUR AND AND THE. TO CONVERSATIONS WE'VE HAD WITH THEM GOING FORWARD IT'S. IT'S VERY CLEAR TO US THAT THEY VIEW THIS AS A TOOL. IT COUNTIES CAN USE AND INSTANCES WHEN IT'S APPROPRIATE. WERE STILL TRYING TO THREAD THE NEEDLE ON ON WHAT THAT MEANS YOU KNOW WHETHER IT'S. A CONFLICT OF INTEREST WHETHER IT'S A LACK OF RESOURCES. AND OR IF IT'S JUST A CASE WHERE THE COUNTY FEELS OVERWHELMED THEM WANTS WANTS TO CALL UPON DPR FOR EXTRA ASSISTANCE NOT EXTRA HAMMER THAT THEY CAN PROVIDE. SO. IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS THE OPPOSITION STATES THAT THERE WERE FOUR CASES AND TWENTY SIXTEEN AND ONE CASE AND TWENTY SEVENTY. IS THIS BILL MEANT TO FIX THE ONE CASE AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND. IS THAT THE RIGHT WAY FOR US TO BE LEGISLATING. SO THE THE YEARS OF. I THINK TWENTY SIXTEEN AND SEVENTEEN THAT WERE MENTIONED AYE I LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT THAT. WE HAVE A STATUE OF LIMITATIONS OF TWO YEARS AND THE FOR THOSE INVESTIGATIONS THAT THEY'RE CURRENTLY STILL ONGOING IMPENDING. THAT'S WHY YOU SEE A LOWER NUMBER OF THAT A MORE ACCURATE NUMBER MAYBE FROM TWENTY TWELVE TO TWENTY FOURTEEN WE HAVE TWENTY ONE TWENTY ONE AND TWENTY SIX. CASES SO THE REASON WHY THERE'S A LOW NUMBER ON THE OTHER ONES IS THOSE THOSE INVESTIGATIONS ARE STILL PENDING. THANK YOU MISTER JUSTICE A STATEMENT OF. SHE CHAIR I'VE WANT TO. ECHO THE COMMENTS OF ASSEMBLYMEMBER GARCIA THANK YOU FOR WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION APPRECIATE YOU DOING THAT AND SOUNDS LIKE YOU CONTINUE TO WORK ON. A SOME LANGUAGE WITH THEM AND AS SOMEONE A RAMBLE I WON'T BE VOTING TODAY. BUT I HOPE ARE YOU CONTINUE TO WORK IN THAT I CAN SUPPORT ON THE FLOOR. GREAT. NONE. NINE SECRETARY TO PLEASE CALL THE ROLL.
