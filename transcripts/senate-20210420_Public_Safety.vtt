00:40:25.289 --> 00:40:27.992
SLEEPER THAN THIS ROOM BUT- YES

00:40:28.058 --> 00:40:30.528
OKAY BUT I WOULD NOTE THAT YOU

00:40:30.594 --> 00:40:31.128
CAN SHOUT FROM THE BACK OF THE

00:40:31.195 --> 00:40:34.031
ROOM. AT THE FRONT AS WE

00:40:34.098 --> 00:40:36.967
WITNESS STAND PAST HEARINGS.

00:40:37.034 --> 00:40:38.269
OKAY AND THEN THE OTHER

00:40:38.335 --> 00:40:40.604
QUESTION I HAD WAS- WITH

00:40:40.671 --> 00:40:42.106
REGARDS TO I WOULD ALSO POINT

00:40:42.173 --> 00:40:44.074
OUT IN DODGER STADIUM FOR THE

00:40:44.141 --> 00:40:44.909
PHYSICALLY OBSTRUCTED THE

00:40:44.975 --> 00:40:46.977
ENTRANCE BUT THERE WERE OVER

00:40:47.044 --> 00:40:47.611
THREE HUNDRED FEET PERHAPS AWAY

00:40:47.678 --> 00:40:49.680
FROM SOMETHING VACCINATION THE

00:40:49.747 --> 00:40:52.416
ACTUAL PLACE WHAT TOOK PLACE.

00:40:52.483 --> 00:40:55.986
OKAY I HAVE- OKAY SO THE- THE

00:40:56.053 --> 00:40:57.421
OTHER QUESTION I HAD WAS WITH

00:40:57.488 --> 00:41:00.257
REGARDS TO- THE PRIVACY OF

00:41:00.324 --> 00:41:03.961
HEALTH- AND HOW DOES THAT

00:41:04.028 --> 00:41:08.199
COMBINED WITH- THE ABILITY TO

00:41:08.265 --> 00:41:10.134
GET THE VACCINES THAT HAVE THAT

00:41:10.201 --> 00:41:13.437
PRIVACY HAVE A- NOTION IN

00:41:13.504 --> 00:41:15.906
PLACE- AND THE REASON I ASK IS

00:41:15.973 --> 00:41:20.644
BECAUSE- THE I ABSOLUTELY AGREE

00:41:20.711 --> 00:41:21.579
THAT WE NEED TO HAVE THE

00:41:21.645 --> 00:41:23.981
ABILITY TO EXPRESS AND HAVE

00:41:24.048 --> 00:41:25.983
THAT FREEDOM TO ASSEMBLE. HOW

00:41:26.050 --> 00:41:29.787
DOES THAT WORK WITH REGARDS TO

00:41:29.854 --> 00:41:33.424
THE PRIVACY OF THE HAVE.

00:41:33.490 --> 00:41:34.658
PATIENTS COMING IN AND GETTING

00:41:34.725 --> 00:41:37.595
VACCINATED. WELL SO THE

00:41:37.661 --> 00:41:39.230
CHALLENGE WOULD BE IS THAT YOU

00:41:39.296 --> 00:41:42.366
HAVE- THE PEOPLE WISH TO

00:41:42.433 --> 00:41:44.735
DISRUPT- THEY WILL USE A

00:41:44.802 --> 00:41:46.437
VARIETY OF TACTICS TO TRY TO

00:41:46.503 --> 00:41:48.739
BULLY AND INTIMIDATE PEOPLE WHO

00:41:48.806 --> 00:41:50.341
HAVE CHOSEN TO GET THE VACCINE-

00:41:50.407 --> 00:41:52.276
THEY COULD TRY TO ACTUALLY TAKE

00:41:52.343 --> 00:41:54.378
PICTURES OF THEM AND POSTED ON

00:41:54.445 --> 00:41:56.146
SOCIAL MEDIA SO THERE BY

00:41:56.213 --> 00:41:58.616
VIOLATING THE PRIVACY- THEY

00:41:58.682 --> 00:42:00.351
YEAH CERTAINLY- SAID WE

00:42:00.417 --> 00:42:02.786
ACTUALLY WITNESSED I'M GOING

00:42:02.853 --> 00:42:04.121
RIGHT UP TO PEOPLE'S. A CAR

00:42:04.188 --> 00:42:07.057
SELL IT OVER DOCTOR STADIUM.

00:42:07.124 --> 00:42:08.192
SHOUTING AT THEM AND BASS BUT

00:42:08.259 --> 00:42:10.628
CERTAINLY IN VISUAL RANGE AND-

00:42:10.694 --> 00:42:11.962
DOWNSTAIRS PHOTOS WERE TAKEN AS

00:42:12.029 --> 00:42:13.497
WELL SO I THINK THERE IS A

00:42:13.564 --> 00:42:15.432
PRIVACY RISK AS WELL DEPENDING

00:42:15.499 --> 00:42:16.901
ON THE BEHAVIOR OF THE PEOPLE

00:42:16.967 --> 00:42:18.869
WHO ARE TRYING TO DISRUPT AND-

00:42:18.936 --> 00:42:20.537
I THINK- WE'VE SEEN TO ANTI

00:42:20.604 --> 00:42:22.273
VACCINE EXTREMISTS USER ID

00:42:22.339 --> 00:42:23.941
DIFFERENT TACTICS TO TRY TO.

00:42:24.008 --> 00:42:25.542
BULLY AND INTIMIDATE AND-

00:42:25.609 --> 00:42:29.079
PEOPLE FROM ACTUALLY PURSUING

00:42:29.146 --> 00:42:30.681
THEIR OWN HEALTHCARE CHOICES.

00:42:30.748 --> 00:42:32.349
SO I'M I'M I'M VERY CAUTIOUS

00:42:32.416 --> 00:42:34.852
BECAUSE I AM VERY- I HAVE MET

00:42:34.919 --> 00:42:37.254
WITH MANY PARENTS WHO ARE- WHO

00:42:37.321 --> 00:42:38.989
HAVE UNFORTUNATELY- HAD

00:42:39.056 --> 00:42:40.691
CHILDREN WHO HAD HAD ADVERSE

00:42:40.758 --> 00:42:43.494
REACTIONS TO VACCINES- YOU KNOW

00:42:43.560 --> 00:42:45.396
I AM A PARENT WHO CHOSE TO HAVE

00:42:45.462 --> 00:42:45.829
MY PARENT MY HILDREN

00:42:45.896 --> 00:42:48.265
VACCINATED- SO I'M VERY I'M

00:42:48.332 --> 00:42:51.302
VERY. SENSITIVE AND VERY

00:42:51.368 --> 00:42:53.737
EMPATHETIC TO BOTH BOTH SIDES

00:42:53.804 --> 00:42:55.739
AS TO HAVING THE OPTION OF

00:42:55.806 --> 00:42:57.508
BEING VACCINATING TO PARENTS

00:42:57.574 --> 00:42:59.576
WHO CHOOSE NOT TO BECAUSE OF

00:42:59.643 --> 00:43:03.914
THE- THE HISTORY AREN'T THERE-

00:43:03.981 --> 00:43:06.750
GENETIC PRE. DISPOSITIONS TO

00:43:06.817 --> 00:43:08.519
ADVERSE REACTIONS TO VACCINES

00:43:08.585 --> 00:43:10.554
SO. I THINK THERE HAS TO BE A

00:43:10.621 --> 00:43:13.958
BALANCE- WITH THIS BILL I FEEL

00:43:14.024 --> 00:43:16.760
THAT BOTH ON THE PROTECTION OF

00:43:16.827 --> 00:43:20.431
THE OF THE PATIENTS COMING IN-

00:43:20.497 --> 00:43:22.032
AND MAKING SURE THAT THEY ARE

00:43:22.099 --> 00:43:23.300
PROTECTED THEIR PRIVACY IS

00:43:23.367 --> 00:43:25.135
PROTECTED AND SO FORTH. I

00:43:25.202 --> 00:43:26.670
ABSOLUTELY APPRECIATE THIS BILL

00:43:26.737 --> 00:43:28.305
AND IN TRYING TO GET THAT

00:43:28.372 --> 00:43:30.808
PRIVACY ELEMENT COMPONENT ON

00:43:30.874 --> 00:43:33.677
THAT END- BUT I ALSO APPRECIATE

00:43:33.744 --> 00:43:36.780
THE FACT THAT. THIS BILL

00:43:36.847 --> 00:43:39.483
DOESN'T NECESSARILY. PROHIBIT

00:43:39.550 --> 00:43:42.152
SOMEONE FROM EXPRESSING OR OR

00:43:42.219 --> 00:43:43.554
SHARING THEIR PERSPECTIVE OR

00:43:43.620 --> 00:43:44.955
THEIR VIEWS IT'S JUST IT'S

00:43:45.022 --> 00:43:46.757
CREATING A BUFFER SOUND TO

00:43:46.824 --> 00:43:49.626
CREATE THAT PRIVACY- THAT'S THE

00:43:49.693 --> 00:43:51.362
WAY THAT I'M READING THE BILL

00:43:51.428 --> 00:43:53.097
AS SOMEONE WHO IS VERY VERY

00:43:53.163 --> 00:43:55.632
PROTECTIVE OF OUR OF OUR OUR

00:43:55.699 --> 00:43:57.601
OUR ABILITY TO EXPRESS YOURSELF

00:43:57.668 --> 00:43:59.136
IN IT AND ASSEMBLE PROTECTING

00:43:59.203 --> 00:44:00.971
THAT FIRST AMENDMENT BUT I ALSO

00:44:01.038 --> 00:44:03.841
SEE THAT AS- WE HAVE TO FIND A

00:44:03.907 --> 00:44:06.610
LITTLE BIT OF A BALANCE- FOR

00:44:06.677 --> 00:44:09.413
PEOPLE ONE TO HAVE THE ABILITY

00:44:09.480 --> 00:44:11.015
TO ASSEMBLE A NUMBER TO HAVE

00:44:11.081 --> 00:44:12.950
THAT PRIVACY FOR THE PATIENTS.

00:44:13.017 --> 00:44:15.352
AND I SEE THAT IF THREE HUNDRED

00:44:15.419 --> 00:44:17.788
FEET SEEMS A LITTLE DAUNTING

00:44:17.855 --> 00:44:20.858
I'M CURIOUS TO KNOW- FROM THE

00:44:20.924 --> 00:44:22.826
OPPOSITION AS TO WHAT WOULD BE

00:44:22.893 --> 00:44:25.129
A REASONABLE- BECAUSE WE DO

00:44:25.195 --> 00:44:26.363
HAVE TO HAVE THAT BALANCE AND I

00:44:26.430 --> 00:44:28.432
WANT I WANT BOTH SIDES TO PUT

00:44:28.499 --> 00:44:30.434
THEMSELVES IN THE OPPOSITE-

00:44:30.501 --> 00:44:33.103
PERSPECTIVE IN AN- AND-

00:44:33.170 --> 00:44:34.705
POSITIONS. WHEN YOU'RE- A

00:44:34.772 --> 00:44:39.410
PATIENT. AIRDATE YOU ARE

00:44:39.476 --> 00:44:41.979
PURSUING INOTES DOCKS NATIONS

00:44:42.046 --> 00:44:43.113
PER SE IN THIS CASES WERE

00:44:43.180 --> 00:44:44.448
REFERRED TO BACK THE NATION'S

00:44:44.515 --> 00:44:46.617
WE WANT THAT- YOU KNOW SOME

00:44:46.683 --> 00:44:48.952
PEOPLE WANT ONE TO LET OTHER

00:44:49.019 --> 00:44:49.686
PEOPLE KNOW THAT THEY'RE

00:44:49.753 --> 00:44:50.821
GETTING VACCINATED OTHERPEOPLE

00:44:50.888 --> 00:44:51.855
WANT TO BE DISCREET A PRIVATE

00:44:51.922 --> 00:44:54.391
ABOUT IT I THINK WE NEED TO

00:44:54.458 --> 00:44:57.327
RESPECT THAT- UNDECIDED BUT

00:44:57.394 --> 00:44:58.962
ALSO FOR HEALTH REASONS AND

00:44:59.029 --> 00:45:01.532
THAT GOES FOR ANY OF OUR- OUR-

00:45:01.598 --> 00:45:03.534
OUR- ELEMENTS THAT WE MAY HAVE.

00:45:03.600 --> 00:45:06.770
BUT ALSO. NOT NOT SAYING THAT

00:45:06.837 --> 00:45:08.772
WE YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO

00:45:08.839 --> 00:45:10.841
EXPRESS AN ASSEMBLE BUT GIVING

00:45:10.908 --> 00:45:12.209
THEM THAT OPPORTUNITY TO DO SO

00:45:12.276 --> 00:45:14.178
AS WELL AND I THINK THIS BILL

00:45:14.244 --> 00:45:14.778
DOESN'T TELL YOU THAT YOU ARE

00:45:14.845 --> 00:45:17.414
NOT ABLE TO- IS JUST SAYING

00:45:17.481 --> 00:45:18.749
THAT. WE NEED A LITTLE BIT OF A

00:45:18.816 --> 00:45:20.851
PRIVACY BUFFER ON THAT END AND

00:45:20.918 --> 00:45:22.853
IF THERE IS- IN THE LEAD

00:45:22.920 --> 00:45:25.122
OPPOSITION ON THE LINE I WOULD.

00:45:25.189 --> 00:45:28.292
BE VERY VERY ADAM CURIOUS TO

00:45:28.358 --> 00:45:33.363
HEAR THEIR THOUGHTS SIR. AM I

00:45:33.430 --> 00:45:36.233

TO THAT TOO- IS IT TOO. WELL I

00:45:41.738 --> 00:45:43.941
CERTAINLY IF I MAY I DO THESE

00:45:44.007 --> 00:45:44.541
DEMONSTRATIONS IN THE CRIMINAL

00:45:44.608 --> 00:45:47.811
JUSTICE. WON'T TAKE YOUR

00:45:47.878 --> 00:45:49.913
REYNOLDS AGAIN WHAT WOULD BE

00:45:49.980 --> 00:45:51.715
WHAT WOULD BE NIGHT RESPONSIBLE.

00:45:51.782 --> 00:45:52.483
THANK SO USUALLY WERE ON THE

00:45:52.549 --> 00:45:56.787
SIDEWALK NEAR AN ENTRANCE OR

00:45:56.854 --> 00:45:58.055
WHERE PEOPLE ARE TRAVELING AND

00:45:58.122 --> 00:45:59.590
WE HAVE SIGNS THAT ARE ARE

00:45:59.656 --> 00:46:00.691
LETTING THEM KNOW ABOUT THINGS

00:46:00.757 --> 00:46:01.391
THAT THEY PROBABLY DON'T

00:46:01.458 --> 00:46:02.993
ALREADY KNOW. AND WE HAVE

00:46:03.060 --> 00:46:05.329
LITERATURE TO- TO GIVE THEM

00:46:05.395 --> 00:46:07.598
MORE INFORMATION SO THREE

00:46:07.664 --> 00:46:09.500
HUNDRED FEET REALLY COMPLETELY

00:46:09.566 --> 00:46:11.602
GETS US OUT OF- THE- LIKE WE

00:46:11.668 --> 00:46:12.669
WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO BE ACROSS

00:46:12.736 --> 00:46:15.506
THE STREET. SO IT WOULD BE HARD

00:46:15.572 --> 00:46:18.075
FOR US TO I SEE TARGET TO ME

00:46:18.142 --> 00:46:19.409
BECAUSE OUR GOAL IS OBVIOUSLY

00:46:19.476 --> 00:46:20.744
TO GIVE INFORMATION TO PEOPLE

00:46:20.811 --> 00:46:21.378
WHO ARE COMING TO GET

00:46:21.445 --> 00:46:23.247
VACCINATED IF WE WERE ABLE TO

00:46:23.313 --> 00:46:25.048
BE ACROSS THE STREET. THE WE

00:46:25.115 --> 00:46:26.350
WE'VE MUCH FURTHER AWAY

00:46:26.416 --> 00:46:28.085
NOBODY'S CELL PHONES GOING TO

00:46:28.152 --> 00:46:29.153
BE ABLE TO SHOW ANYBODY'S FACE

00:46:29.219 --> 00:46:31.255
IN EVERYBODY'S FACES IS PRETTY

00:46:31.321 --> 00:46:33.190
MUCH MASTERED THEIR CARS I MEAN

00:46:33.257 --> 00:46:33.991
WHEN THEY'RE COMING INTO A

00:46:34.057 --> 00:46:35.325
COVER NINETEEN VACCINATION SITE

00:46:35.392 --> 00:46:37.227
ALMOST EVERYBODY HAS A MASK ON

00:46:37.294 --> 00:46:38.162
IN THEIR CAR SO THEIR

00:46:38.228 --> 00:46:39.897
IDENTITIES. REALLY I THINK

00:46:39.963 --> 00:46:43.066
ALREADY PROTECTED BUT- THE

00:46:43.133 --> 00:46:44.168
THREE HUNDRED FEET THING IS

00:46:44.234 --> 00:46:44.735
GOING TO KEEP US FROM EVEN

00:46:44.801 --> 00:46:46.737
BEING ACROSS THE STREET WHICH

00:46:46.803 --> 00:46:48.605
PUTS US WAY FAR OUT TO A POINT

00:46:48.672 --> 00:46:50.574
WHERE IT'S HARD FOR US TO GET

00:46:50.641 --> 00:46:53.377
THIS INFORMATION TO THE PEOPLE

00:46:53.443 --> 00:46:56.246
COMING IN TO GET VACCINATED.

00:46:56.313 --> 00:46:58.649
SEVEN MARCH TWENTY MILLION

00:46:58.715 --> 00:47:00.083
THIRTY SECONDS. THE SUPREME

00:47:00.150 --> 00:47:02.853
COURT HAS STRUCK DOWN THIRTY

00:47:02.920 --> 00:47:04.555
FIVE POINT BUFFER ZONES AROUND

ABORTION CLINICS SO THE DEAD

THREE HUNDRED FIVE BUFFER ZONE

00:47:07.958 --> 00:47:12.462
IS VERY LEGALLY PROBLEMATIC.

00:47:12.529 --> 00:47:15.065
I'M SORRY ONE MORE TIME. TO SET

00:47:15.132 --> 00:47:16.767
TO SEPARATE ORDER STRUCK DOWN A

00:47:16.833 --> 00:47:18.869
THIRTY FOOT BUFFER AT A PORTION

00:47:18.936 --> 00:47:20.871
CLINICS AND USES THREE HUNDRED

00:47:20.938 --> 00:47:23.974

AS YOUR FEEDBACK AS TO AS TO

00:47:31.048 --> 00:47:32.683
THAT PERSPECTIVE THAT POINT I

00:47:32.749 --> 00:47:34.785
JUST POINT OUT THAT- THAT

00:47:34.851 --> 00:47:36.954
ACTUALLY- FOR ALL THE CLAIMS OF

00:47:37.020 --> 00:47:38.255
THIS BEING A CONSTITUTIONAL

00:47:38.322 --> 00:47:41.258
ACTUALLY- IT'S- SOME OF US HAVE

00:47:41.325 --> 00:47:42.926
BEEN UPHELD BY THE COURTS-

00:47:42.993 --> 00:47:44.561
NGUYEN ANTI GAY PROTESTERS THE

00:47:44.628 --> 00:47:45.762
DISTRIBUTED AT FUNERALS FOR

00:47:45.829 --> 00:47:48.031
FAMILY FOR MILITARY MEMBERS.

00:47:48.098 --> 00:47:48.899
AND SAID THEIR BUFFER ZONES

00:47:48.966 --> 00:47:50.300
HAVE BEEN HELPFUL FOR BRICK AND

00:47:50.367 --> 00:47:52.970

THE MASK YOU CAN STILL IDENTIFY

00:48:53.797 --> 00:48:55.599

THE ASSERTION BY THE DA'S THAT

01:42:07.120 --> 01:42:08.789
THIS IS LIKE A DOUBLE DIP IN

01:42:08.856 --> 01:42:10.190

THE OPPORTUNITY THAT I RESPECT

01:42:15.896 --> 01:42:18.532
THE CDA IS CONCERNS HOWEVER I

01:42:18.599 --> 01:42:20.167
POINT OUT THE CURRENT LAW.

01:42:20.234 --> 01:42:22.102
ALREADY CONTEMPLATES THIS TYPE

01:42:22.169 --> 01:42:23.403
OF PROCESS FOR VETERANS AND

01:42:23.470 --> 01:42:24.505
SERVICE MEMBERS WHO WERE

01:42:24.571 --> 01:42:26.406
CONVICTED OF A FELONY AFTER

01:42:26.473 --> 01:42:28.475
JANUARY FIRST TWO THOUSAND

01:42:28.542 --> 01:42:29.309
FIFTEEN WITH THIS BILL WOULD DO

01:42:29.376 --> 01:42:31.144
IS SIMPLY HARMONIZED THAT BY

01:42:31.211 --> 01:42:32.946
ALLOWING THOSE CONVICTED PRIOR

01:42:33.013 --> 01:42:34.548
TO JANUARY FIRST TWO THOUSAND

01:42:34.615 --> 01:42:35.148
FIFTEEN WITH THE SAME PROCESS

01:42:35.215 --> 01:42:36.917
SO- I WOULD RESPECTFULLY

01:42:36.984 --> 01:42:38.585
DISAGREE THAT THIS IS. NOT THIS

01:42:38.652 --> 01:42:40.387
IS NOT UNPRECEDENTED THIS IS

01:42:40.454 --> 01:42:41.722
VERY MUCH PRESIDENT AND IS

01:42:41.788 --> 01:42:43.824
SIMPLY HARMONIZES THE LAW I'D

01:42:43.891 --> 01:42:46.026
ALSO POINT OUT THAT THERE. IS

01:42:46.093 --> 01:42:47.761
AS THE SCIENCE IS INCREASING

01:42:47.828 --> 01:42:50.364
SHOWING A OFTEN A LAG AND AN

01:42:50.430 --> 01:42:52.165
INABILITY FOR SERVICE MEMBERS

01:42:52.232 --> 01:42:53.033
AND VETERANS TO BE DIAGNOSED

01:42:53.100 --> 01:42:54.268
WITH MENTAL ILLNESS SO IT'S

01:42:54.334 --> 01:42:55.836
OFTEN IMPOSSIBLE FOR THEM TO

01:42:55.903 --> 01:42:57.704
RAISE THIS ISSUE AT TRIAL-

01:42:57.771 --> 01:42:59.139
SIMPLY BECAUSE OF THE BACKLOG

01:42:59.206 --> 01:43:00.941
WITH RECEIVING. MENTAL HEALTH

01:43:01.008 --> 01:43:03.443
TREATMENT AND DIAGNOSIS SO- I

01:43:03.510 --> 01:43:04.411
THINK THIS IS THE RIGHT THING

01:43:04.478 --> 01:43:06.280
TO DO FOR VETERANS I APPRECIATE

01:43:06.346 --> 01:43:08.081
THE QUESTION AND AGAIN WHILE I

01:43:08.148 --> 01:43:12.486
RESPECT THE DA'S CONCERNS. I

01:43:12.553 --> 01:43:14.755
RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE WITH THEM.

01:43:14.821 --> 01:43:18.892
BETTER SKINNER- TYPE THE CLEAR

01:43:18.959 --> 01:43:21.428
AND- PREHEAT YOUR EXPRESSION

01:43:21.495 --> 01:43:23.163
HOWEVER I THINK THAT IT'S

01:43:23.230 --> 01:43:25.065
ALWAYS HELPFUL ESPECIALLY WHEN

01:43:25.132 --> 01:43:27.067
WE HAVE EXPERT WITNESSES I'M

01:43:27.134 --> 01:43:29.336
SORRY IF. NO TICKET THAT THEY

01:43:29.403 --> 01:43:32.105
BE ACCURATE IN THEIR TESTIMONY

01:43:32.172 --> 01:43:35.142
SO IF BY IN TERMS OF WHEN I

01:43:35.208 --> 01:43:36.510
READ THE ANALYSIS AND THEN

01:43:36.577 --> 01:43:39.746
YOUR- RESPONSE I WOULD-

01:43:39.813 --> 01:43:43.717
ASSERTED THE- DA'S ASSOCIATE

01:43:43.784 --> 01:43:45.886
STAFF WERE RATHER ENACT MAYBE

01:43:45.953 --> 01:43:47.421
THEY DIDN'T ACTUALLY READ THE

01:43:47.487 --> 01:43:51.158
BILL- AGAIN FROM THE ANALYSIS

01:43:51.224 --> 01:43:55.629
AND- THIS IS WHAT THIS ALLOWS

01:43:55.696 --> 01:43:57.064
IS FOR THOSE PEOPLE WHO WERE-

01:43:57.130 --> 01:43:59.733
SENTENCED. TO JANUARY TWENTY

01:43:59.800 --> 01:44:01.668
FIFTEENTH SO I'M NOT SURE WHY

01:44:01.735 --> 01:44:05.472
THAT. WHAT HOW THE DA'S

01:44:05.539 --> 01:44:06.940
ASSOCIATION COULD ASSERT THAT

01:44:07.007 --> 01:44:09.409
THIS IS TWO BITES AT THE APPLE-

01:44:09.476 --> 01:44:11.878
SO WITH THAT I MEAN I

01:44:11.945 --> 01:44:13.914
PERSONALLY BELIEVE THAT. WHAT

01:44:13.981 --> 01:44:17.317
WE'VE NOW LEARNED ABOUT TRAUMA

01:44:17.384 --> 01:44:19.319
AND A LITTLE TYPE OF TRAUMA

01:44:19.386 --> 01:44:24.591
THAT- MANY VETERANS EXPERIENCE.

01:44:24.658 --> 01:44:26.326
AND OTHERS IN DIFFERENT

01:44:26.393 --> 01:44:28.729
CIRCUMSTANCES FOR EXAMPLE IF

01:44:28.795 --> 01:44:31.765
YOU GROW UP AND- WITNESS GUN

01:44:31.832 --> 01:44:35.002
VIOLENCE ON. MULTIPLE TIMES IT

01:44:35.068 --> 01:44:38.005
AS A YOUTH THAT TRAUMA IS VERY

01:44:38.071 --> 01:44:39.306
COMPARABLE TO THE TYPE OF

01:44:39.373 --> 01:44:41.108
TRAUMA THAT A VETERAN

01:44:41.174 --> 01:44:43.010
EXPERIENCES IN A COMBAT ZONE.

01:44:43.076 --> 01:44:46.813
SO I'VE GIVEN WHAT WE NOW THE

01:44:46.880 --> 01:44:48.181
RESEARCH HAS BEEN DONE WHAT WE

01:44:48.248 --> 01:44:49.883
NOW KNOW ABOUT THE IMPACT OF

01:44:49.950 --> 01:44:52.386
THAT TRAUMA I THINK FACTORING

01:44:52.452 --> 01:44:54.187
IN THE IMPACTS OF TRAUMA ON

01:44:54.254 --> 01:44:56.323
PEOPLE'S SUBSEQUENT BEHAVIOR

01:44:56.390 --> 01:44:57.891
ESPECIALLY IF THAT WAS IF THAT

01:44:57.958 --> 01:44:59.359
TRAUMA WAS NOT PREVIOUSLY

01:44:59.426 --> 01:45:01.728
RECOGNIZED OR TREATED IS A VERY

01:45:01.795 --> 01:45:03.864
IMPORTANT ASPECT OF US

01:45:03.930 --> 01:45:06.600

VERY COMMON WORD IN THIS

02:07:20.866 --> 02:07:21.333
COMMITTEE BUT I THINK THE

02:07:21.400 --> 02:07:24.003
TRAUMA THAT. WE AND I SAY A

02:07:24.069 --> 02:07:26.705
COLLECTIVE WEEK OUR-

02:07:26.772 --> 02:07:28.774
COMMUNITIES WHO UNFORTUNATELY

02:07:28.841 --> 02:07:30.309
HAVE BEEN SUBJECT TO MORE

02:07:30.376 --> 02:07:32.111
POLICE VIOLENCE BUT ALSO OUR

02:07:32.177 --> 02:07:34.346
LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS. WHO

VARIOUS ENCOUNTERS WHETHER IT'S-

02:07:40.652 --> 02:07:44.656
CIRCUMSTANCES IN AS A. FIVE

02:07:44.723 --> 02:07:45.991
WHETHER TO TRAFFIC STOP FOR ANY

02:07:46.058 --> 02:07:49.194
NUMBER OF THINGS WHERE WHERE AN

02:07:49.261 --> 02:07:52.965
ARMED PERSON CAN ALSO DO HARM

02:07:53.032 --> 02:07:55.334
TO THE OFFICERS THAT THIS. THAT

02:07:55.401 --> 02:08:03.409
THESE. THIS VERY- IT'S ALMOST I

02:08:03.475 --> 02:08:04.676
I'M NOT SURE WHAT WORD TO USE

02:08:04.743 --> 02:08:06.678
BUT THE CIRCUMSTANCES ARE

02:08:06.745 --> 02:08:11.116
INTENSE AND THEY OFTEN THEY CAN

02:08:11.183 --> 02:08:15.621
LEAD TO. NOT GOOD DECISIONS AND

02:08:15.687 --> 02:08:19.124
I THINK THE S. B. PRESIDENT

02:08:19.191 --> 02:08:21.627
PORAC MENTION OR MAYBE IT WAS

02:08:21.693 --> 02:08:25.898

02:08:25.964 --> 02:08:29.168
TRAINING AND MORE EDUCATION

02:08:29.234 --> 02:08:31.437
WELL IT WOULD NOT ELIMINATE.

02:08:31.503 --> 02:08:33.172
MUCH AS SOME OF THE REACTIONS

02:08:33.238 --> 02:08:35.474
THAT OCCUR. IT COULD GREATLY

02:08:35.541 --> 02:08:39.711
IMPROVE THEM. AND WE I THINK WE

02:08:39.778 --> 02:08:44.116
HAVE AIRED IN THAT. GIVEN THAT

02:08:44.183 --> 02:08:46.952

02:08:47.019 --> 02:08:50.522
JOBS THAT IN PUBLIC SERVICE

02:08:50.589 --> 02:08:53.425
WERE BASICALLY WE ALLOW. BY

02:08:53.492 --> 02:08:57.596
BEING ARMED IN FACT. AND I

02:08:57.663 --> 02:08:59.098
DON'T MEAN TO SAY THIS LIGHTLY

02:08:59.164 --> 02:09:01.266
WE ALLOW SWORN OFFICERS TO TAKE

02:09:01.333 --> 02:09:06.071
SOMEONE'S LIFE. THAT TO HAVE

02:09:06.138 --> 02:09:08.574
THE KIND OF MINIMAL EDUCATION

02:09:08.640 --> 02:09:10.209
AND TRAINING THAT WE HAVE THUS

02:09:10.275 --> 02:09:13.178

02:09:14.646 --> 02:09:16.415
I FEEL THAT YOU HAVE NO

02:09:16.482 --> 02:09:18.650
TRAINING NO BUT THE- BUT GIVEN

02:09:18.717 --> 02:09:19.818

02:09:22.588 --> 02:09:24.723

YOUR BILL AND WE ALSO. AND I

02:09:30.295 --> 02:09:32.598

NOW BEEN SOMEWHAT MODIFIED.

02:09:34.533 --> 02:09:36.568

BE- ASSISTING THAT OTHER GOAL

02:09:53.252 --> 02:09:55.754
JUST BY. THE CHANGE IN OUR

02:12:17.663 --> 02:12:19.231
THEY'RE WORKING TO MAKE SURE

02:12:19.298 --> 02:12:20.999
THAT THE FOLKS WHO THEY ARE

02:12:21.066 --> 02:12:24.403
SERVING ARE ALSO PROTECTED AND

02:12:24.469 --> 02:12:27.906
ARE SAFE- I HOPE THAT THERE CAN

02:12:27.973 --> 02:12:29.741
BE DEEPER DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THE

02:12:29.808 --> 02:12:31.443
KINDS OF TRAINING THAT OUR

02:12:31.510 --> 02:12:33.945
OFFICERS NEED- THE KINDS OF

02:12:34.012 --> 02:12:35.480
EDUCATION THAT THEY SHOULD

02:12:35.547 --> 02:12:38.317
HAVE. AND WHAT THE DECISIONS

02:12:38.383 --> 02:12:39.951
THAT THEY ARE BEING ASKED TO

02:12:40.018 --> 02:12:42.154
MAKE HOW THOSE DECISIONS IMPACT

02:12:42.220 --> 02:12:44.022
NOT JUST THE INDIVIDUAL OR THE

02:12:44.089 --> 02:12:46.124
INDIVIDUAL'S THAT THEY MAY BE

02:12:46.191 --> 02:12:47.959
CONFRONTING. BUT THE FAMILY

02:12:48.026 --> 02:12:49.227
MEMBERS AND THE NEIGHBORHOODS

02:12:49.294 --> 02:12:50.562
AND THE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE

02:12:50.629 --> 02:12:52.864
ALSO IMPACTED EVERY SINGLE DAY

02:12:52.931 --> 02:12:54.032
BY THE DECISIONS THAT THEY

02:12:54.099 --> 02:12:56.401
MAKE. AND WE'VE GOT TO FIND A

02:12:56.468 --> 02:12:58.570
WAY TO EMPOWER FOLKS WITH

02:12:58.637 --> 02:13:02.140
EDUCATION AND INFORMATION. TO

02:13:02.207 --> 02:13:04.776
NOT JUST GO TO THE LOWEST

02:13:04.843 --> 02:13:07.145
COMMON DENOMINATOR WHEN IT

02:13:07.212 --> 02:13:09.448
COMES TO CRISIS RESOLUTION AND

02:13:09.514 --> 02:13:10.549
I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE'RE BEING

02:13:10.615 --> 02:13:13.952
CONFRONTED WITH NOW IN CURRENT

02:13:14.019 --> 02:13:16.888
TIMES- AS WE ARE TALKING ABOUT

02:13:16.955 --> 02:13:19.358
PUBLIC SAFETY SO. I JUST WANTED

02:13:19.424 --> 02:13:22.527
TO SAY THAT AND- I WILL BE

02:13:22.594 --> 02:13:25.897
SUPPORTING THIS MEASURE- WITH

02:13:25.964 --> 02:13:26.498
THE AMENDMENTS HAVE BEEN TAKEN

02:13:26.565 --> 02:13:29.201
THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR

02:13:32.337 --> 02:13:33.972
MEASURE TODAY WANT TO THANK THE

02:13:34.039 --> 02:13:35.440
AUTHOR FOR TAKING THAT

02:13:35.507 --> 02:13:36.641
AMENDMENTS AS I THINK OUR

02:13:36.708 --> 02:13:38.710
EXPRESS PREVIOUSLY. THE HEART

02:13:38.777 --> 02:13:39.911
OF THIS BILL IS ABOUT THE

02:13:39.978 --> 02:13:41.613
EDUCATION REQUIREMENTS AND I

02:13:41.680 --> 02:13:42.981
REALLY THINK IT'S GREAT TO

02:13:43.048 --> 02:13:45.083
FOCUS THE BILL ON THAT BECAUSE

02:13:45.150 --> 02:13:46.752
IT'S REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT.

02:13:46.818 --> 02:13:48.954
AND I THINK THIS BILL TAKES AN

02:13:49.020 --> 02:13:51.256
INCREDIBLY THOUGHTFUL APPROACH

02:13:51.323 --> 02:13:52.758
TO THOSE AND A FLEXIBLE

02:13:52.824 --> 02:13:54.593
APPROACH TO THOSE EDUCATION.

02:13:54.659 --> 02:13:56.728
REQUIREMENTS SO I THINK IT'S A

02:13:56.795 --> 02:13:59.464
POSITIVE THING I HAVE FOR MANY

02:13:59.531 --> 02:14:01.366
MANY MANY YEARS AS A-

02:14:01.433 --> 02:14:03.101
NEIGHBORHOOD LEADER BEFORE I

02:14:03.168 --> 02:14:05.036
WAS IN PUBLIC OFFICE AS A LOCAL

02:14:05.103 --> 02:14:08.240
ELECTED OFFICIAL- AND MY JOB IS

02:14:08.306 --> 02:14:10.942
ATTORNEY INTERACTED WITH A LOT

02:14:11.009 --> 02:14:11.510
OF POLICE OFFICERS OVER THE

02:14:11.576 --> 02:14:13.578
YEARS. AND THERE'S A HUGE

02:14:13.645 --> 02:14:15.781
SPECTRUM OF OFFICES IN TERMS OF

02:14:15.847 --> 02:14:17.949
PERSONALITY TYPES- BUT ALSO

02:14:18.016 --> 02:14:19.918
JUST SKILL SETS AND INTERACTING

02:14:19.985 --> 02:14:21.820
WITH THE PUBLIC IN A WAY THAT

02:14:21.887 --> 02:14:24.556
DOES NOT LEAD. TO USE OF FORCE

02:14:24.623 --> 02:14:25.457
AND WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE

02:14:25.524 --> 02:14:26.625
PLENTY OF POLICE OFFICERS WHO

02:14:26.691 --> 02:14:28.960
ARE VERY SKILLED WHO NEVER FIRE

02:14:29.027 --> 02:14:30.996
THEIR- GUN THEIR ENTIRE CAREER

02:14:31.062 --> 02:14:32.497
THERE I THINK IT'S A VAST

02:14:32.564 --> 02:14:34.666
MAJORITY AND I THINK SOMETHING

02:14:34.733 --> 02:14:36.034
LIKE A MAJORITY OF OFFICERS

02:14:36.101 --> 02:14:38.703
NEVER EVEN DRAW. THEIR PISTOL

02:14:38.770 --> 02:14:42.707
IN THEIR ENTIRE CAREER- AND SO

02:14:42.774 --> 02:14:45.010
THERE ARE A LOT OF OFFICERS WHO

02:14:45.076 --> 02:14:47.045
I THINK ARE YOU KNOW. OUR OUR

02:14:47.112 --> 02:14:49.247
HAVE THOSE SKILLS BUT WE NEED

02:14:49.314 --> 02:14:52.050
TO BE ALL OFFICERS WANT TO BE A

02:14:52.117 --> 02:14:53.618
HUNDRED PERCENT- AND I THINK

02:14:53.685 --> 02:14:55.086
THIS BILL WILL THERE'S NO

02:14:55.153 --> 02:14:56.822
SILVER BULLET BUT THIS BILL

02:14:56.888 --> 02:14:57.722
WILL HELP MOVE US IN THAT

02:14:57.789 --> 02:15:00.325
DIRECTION- AND SO I'M HAPPY TO

02:15:00.392 --> 02:15:04.996
MOVE. THE BILL THERE HASN'T

02:15:05.063 --> 02:15:05.597
BEEN A MOTION ALREADY. THANK

02:15:05.664 --> 02:15:06.331
YOU. AND I WANT TO THANK OF MY

02:15:06.398 --> 02:15:08.133
CALL. FOR MAKING THEIR COMMENTS

02:15:08.200 --> 02:15:09.734
ON THIS MEASURE AND I TOO WANT

02:15:09.801 --> 02:15:11.503
TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR.

02:15:11.570 --> 02:15:13.271
WORKING NOT ONLY WITH THIS

02:15:13.338 --> 02:15:14.940
COMMITTEE WILL WITH ME TO MOVE

02:15:15.006 --> 02:15:16.975
FORWARD AND BRINGING FORTH THE

02:15:17.042 --> 02:15:17.676
MEASURE THAT WE CAN ALL

02:15:17.742 --> 02:15:19.678
SUPPORT. AND I THINK IT WOULD

02:15:19.744 --> 02:15:22.113
BE NO ARGUMENT THAT A BETTER

02:15:22.180 --> 02:15:25.484
TRAINED OFFICER IS A- MAKES OUR

02:15:25.550 --> 02:15:28.153
COMMUNITY SAFER. BUT I THINK WE

02:15:28.220 --> 02:15:30.322
ALL HAVE TO AGREE THAT TRAINING

02:15:30.388 --> 02:15:33.225
IN AND OF ITSELF IS NOT ENOUGH.

02:15:33.291 --> 02:15:35.527
WE'VE SEEN TOO FAR TOO MANY

02:15:35.594 --> 02:15:37.128
INCIDENTS WHERE THEY GET IT

02:15:37.195 --> 02:15:39.030
RIGHT IN WHITE NEIGHBORHOODS.

02:15:39.097 --> 02:15:40.165
BUT THEY DON'T GET A RIDE IN

02:15:40.232 --> 02:15:41.766
BLACK AND BROWN NEIGHBORHOODS

02:15:41.833 --> 02:15:43.134
IT SEEMS LIKE THEY KNOW WHEN

02:15:43.201 --> 02:15:45.570
THE DRAW THEIR WEAPON. IN A

02:15:45.637 --> 02:15:47.772
FLUID NEIGHBORHOODS AND- THE

02:15:47.839 --> 02:15:49.674
SAME THING THAT. CONFRONTS THEM

02:15:49.741 --> 02:15:50.809
IN A BLACK NEIGHBORHOOD MAKE

02:15:50.876 --> 02:15:53.812
SOME FEAR FOR THEIR LIVES AND-

02:15:53.879 --> 02:15:56.648
IT GOES TO RECRUITMENT AS WELL.

02:15:56.715 --> 02:15:59.584
AND THAT WAS FBI STUDY ABOUT

02:15:59.651 --> 02:16:01.486
FOUR YEARS AGO THE STATE IT.

02:16:01.553 --> 02:16:03.522
THE LARGEST RECRUITMENT OF

02:16:03.588 --> 02:16:06.658
WHITE SUPREMACIST. INDIVIDUALS

02:16:06.725 --> 02:16:08.460
ARE IN LAW ENFORCEMENT RIGHT

02:16:08.527 --> 02:16:09.094
NOW THAT SHOULD BE TROUBLING TO

02:16:09.160 --> 02:16:10.829
ALL OF US WHETHER YOU'RE A

02:16:10.896 --> 02:16:12.464
MINORITY WHETHER YOU'RE WHITE

02:16:12.531 --> 02:16:14.699
THIS SHOULD BE A CONCERN TO ALL

02:16:14.766 --> 02:16:16.768
OF US SO RECRUITMENT IS. TRUE

02:16:16.835 --> 02:16:21.506
TRULY A MAJOR PART OF THIS. AND

02:16:21.573 --> 02:16:23.341
CHANGING THE I DON'T KNOW IF

02:16:23.408 --> 02:16:25.410
YOU CAN CHANGE SOMEONE'S HEART.

02:16:25.477 --> 02:16:28.046
BECAUSE WE ALL KNOW THAT THERE

02:16:28.113 --> 02:16:32.384
IS PREJUDICE. THERE IS HATRED

02:16:32.450 --> 02:16:34.085
AND I DON'T KNOW ALL THE

02:16:34.152 --> 02:16:35.754
TRAINING WORLD IT'S GONNA.

02:16:35.820 --> 02:16:37.455
REMOVE THAT BECAUSE FOR SOME

02:16:37.522 --> 02:16:39.357
FOLKS IT'S A GREAT FEAR OF

02:16:39.424 --> 02:16:41.593
ANYONE WITH MELANIN IN THEIR

02:16:41.660 --> 02:16:44.429
SKIN TONE. AND I WILL ONLY USE

02:16:44.496 --> 02:16:46.565
EXAMPLE OF JUST A FEW MONTHS

02:16:46.631 --> 02:16:49.234
AGO WHEN A WHITE INDIVIDUAL

02:16:49.301 --> 02:16:51.136
WENT INTO A POLICE DEPARTMENT.

02:16:51.202 --> 02:16:53.772
JUST NORTH OF HERE. CLEARLY

02:16:53.838 --> 02:16:55.373
STATED HE WANTED TO KILL

02:16:55.440 --> 02:16:59.711
OFFICERS. CLEARLY STATED HE WAS

02:16:59.778 --> 02:17:02.414
THERE TO KILL OFFICERS EVEN

02:17:02.480 --> 02:17:05.016
TOOK AN OFFICER'S BRIAN HEAD

02:17:05.083 --> 02:17:06.618
CAME IN WITH A GUN FOR SELF I

02:17:06.685 --> 02:17:09.588
SHOULD SAY AND THAT INDIVIDUAL

02:17:09.654 --> 02:17:12.257
SOMEHOW MADE IT OUT ALIVE WAS

02:17:12.324 --> 02:17:16.294

02:17:16.361 --> 02:17:16.895

OFFICERS YOU FIND YOURSELF MORE

02:17:28.974 --> 02:17:32.143
OFTEN THAN NOT SHOT AND KILLED.

02:17:32.210 --> 02:17:33.812
AND EVADING ARREST SHOULD NOT

02:17:33.878 --> 02:17:35.914
BE A DEATH SENTENCE RUNNING

02:17:35.981 --> 02:17:37.349
FROM A POLICE OFFICER SHOULD

02:17:37.415 --> 02:17:39.618
NOT BE A DEATH SENTENCE AND

02:17:39.684 --> 02:17:41.553

HERE THEY- NOT EXERCISE THEIR

PEREMPTORY CHALLENGES ARE BASED

A TRIAL LAWYER AND THAT'S

02:39:57.120 --> 02:39:58.722
EXACTLY WHAT THE BASIS IS THE

02:39:58.789 --> 02:40:01.058
BASIS IS TO LOOK AT JURORS AND

02:40:01.124 --> 02:40:02.726
FIGURE OUT WHAT DO YOU THINK

02:40:02.793 --> 02:40:04.127
YOU CAN SKEW THE JURY TO YOUR

02:40:04.194 --> 02:40:05.896
SIDE. BASED ON BIAS AND

02:40:05.963 --> 02:40:07.464
PREJUDICE THAT IS NO PLACE IN

02:40:07.531 --> 02:40:09.733
OUR SYSTEM. THE CONSTITUTION

MIKE MY COLLEAGUES JUST AS

02:40:50.674 --> 02:40:53.710
WHERE YOU AND I ROACH INFO IN

02:40:53.777 --> 02:40:55.312
FAVOR OF SB THIRTY SEVENTY.

02:40:55.379 --> 02:40:57.547
WHEN IT WAS UNDER CONSIDERATION

02:40:57.614 --> 02:40:59.549
AND I STILL BELIEVE IT WAS. A

02:40:59.616 --> 02:41:01.151
STEP FORWARD IN THE RIGHT

02:41:01.218 --> 02:41:04.788
DIRECTION. EVIDENCE MATTERS IN

02:41:04.855 --> 02:41:06.723
FACT. BETTER RESEARCHERS YOU

02:41:06.790 --> 02:41:07.791
HEARD SHOWS THE PRINTER

02:41:07.858 --> 02:41:09.226
CHALLENGES ARE NOT EFFECTIVELY

02:41:09.292 --> 02:41:12.362
USED BY ANYONE ESSENTIALLY IN

02:41:12.429 --> 02:41:13.163
ARE THE CAUSE OF STRUCTURAL

02:41:13.230 --> 02:41:15.232
BIAS. AGAINST POTENTIAL JURORS

02:41:15.298 --> 02:41:17.434
OF COLOR. AND OTHER BIASES AS

02:41:17.501 --> 02:41:19.169
WELL NOT JUST LIMITED TO THAT

02:41:19.236 --> 02:41:21.338
DEMOGRAPHIC. AN ATTORNEY

02:41:21.405 --> 02:41:22.806
PATERNITY DESPITE THE EVIDENCE

02:41:22.873 --> 02:41:24.808
UNIFORMLY BELIEVE THAT THEY USE

02:41:24.875 --> 02:41:28.211
THEM WELL EVEN IF EVERYONE ELSE

02:41:28.278 --> 02:41:30.514
DOESN'T. ELIMINATION OF BIAS IN

02:41:30.580 --> 02:41:32.315
THE JUSTICE SYSTEM IN MY VIEW

02:41:32.382 --> 02:41:35.685
MUST BE DONE. SYSTEMATICALLY

02:41:35.752 --> 02:41:38.055
AND SYSTEMICALLY. WHAT I MEAN

02:41:38.121 --> 02:41:40.557
IS THAT BOTH SB THIRTY SEVENTY

02:41:40.624 --> 02:41:43.260
AND S. B. TWENTY TWELVE. ARE

02:41:43.326 --> 02:41:45.695
DESIGNED TO ADDRESS ONE FORM OR

02:41:45.762 --> 02:41:48.765
ONE SOURCE ON THE MANIFESTATION

02:41:48.832 --> 02:41:50.600
OF THIS BIAS SYSTEMATICALLY

02:41:50.667 --> 02:41:53.070
THAT IS. I'M PRETTY CHALLENGES

02:41:53.136 --> 02:41:55.639
AND HOW THEY ARE USED BY

02:41:55.705 --> 02:41:58.408
COUNSEL IN CASES. BUT I WROTE

02:41:58.475 --> 02:41:59.443
IN THAT OPINION YOU HEARD

02:41:59.509 --> 02:42:03.313
REFERENCE. EIGHT YEARS AGO THAT

02:42:03.380 --> 02:42:04.414
WE SHOULD ABOLISH PEREMPTORY

02:42:04.481 --> 02:42:06.616
CHALLENGES ALTOGETHER AND I

02:42:06.683 --> 02:42:09.386
STILL BELIEVE. THAT THAT IS THE

02:42:09.453 --> 02:42:11.988
BETTER COURSE. ON THE SCIENCE

02:42:12.055 --> 02:42:14.691
AND EVIDENCE SUPPORTS IT BUT

02:42:14.758 --> 02:42:16.726
THE ELIMINATION OF. BRENT CRUDE

02:42:16.793 --> 02:42:19.029
CHALLENGES IS NOT A PANACEA FOR

02:42:19.096 --> 02:42:20.664
ALL MANIFESTATIONS OF BIAS IN

02:42:20.730 --> 02:42:23.500
OUR SYSTEM. IN WASHINGTON STATE

02:42:23.567 --> 02:42:26.136
WE DID NOT ELIMINATE PEREMPTORY

02:42:26.203 --> 02:42:28.238
CHALLENGES I RECOMMEND IT. BUT

02:42:28.305 --> 02:42:30.340
WE ADOPTED OUR GENERAL RULE

02:42:30.407 --> 02:42:31.675
THIRTY SEVEN WHICH WAS A MODEL

02:42:31.741 --> 02:42:33.910
FOR A BI THIRTY SEVENTY BUT I

02:42:33.977 --> 02:42:36.079
BELIEVE IT TO BE A COMPROMISE

02:42:36.146 --> 02:42:38.215
THAT MOVES US SUBSTANTIALLY. IN

02:42:38.281 --> 02:42:40.417
THE RIGHT DIRECTION. ONE

02:42:40.484 --> 02:42:42.252
EMPHASIZE THAT IT'S NOT ENOUGH

02:42:42.319 --> 02:42:44.788
TO SYSTEMATICALLY REDUCE BIAS.

02:42:44.855 --> 02:42:46.656
ELIMINATION MUST ALSO BE

02:42:46.723 --> 02:42:49.126
SYSTEMIC. DISTINGUISH

02:42:49.192 --> 02:42:51.294
SYSTEMATIC FROM SYSTEMIC. IN

02:42:51.361 --> 02:42:53.663
THIS WAY. SYSTEMATIC IS GETTING

02:42:53.730 --> 02:42:55.832
A RULE THAT ADDRESSES HOW IT

02:42:55.899 --> 02:42:57.734
MANIFESTS IN THE EXERCISE OF

02:42:57.801 --> 02:42:59.302
PEREMPTORIES. BUT IS

02:42:59.369 --> 02:43:01.004
INSUFFICIENT ONLY TO DO THAT

02:43:01.071 --> 02:43:02.405
BECAUSE WHEN YOU ELIMINATE BIAS

02:43:02.472 --> 02:43:04.708
IN ONE PLACE REEMERGES

02:43:04.774 --> 02:43:05.475
SOMEWHERE ELSE IT HAS TO BE

02:43:05.542 --> 02:43:08.145
DONE. SYSTEMICALLY AS WELL ALL

02:43:08.211 --> 02:43:09.813
PHASES OF JURY SELECTION AND

02:43:09.880 --> 02:43:12.015
INDEED THE SYSTEM AS A WHOLE.

02:43:12.082 --> 02:43:12.916
NEEDS TO BE EVALUATED AND

02:43:12.983 --> 02:43:14.718
REEVALUATED BUT ELIMINATION OF

02:43:14.784 --> 02:43:16.586
BIAS THAT REASSESSMENT OF OUR

02:43:16.653 --> 02:43:20.390
FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES IN MIND-

02:43:20.457 --> 02:43:21.391
SELECTION AT IMPROVE THE SOURCE

02:43:21.458 --> 02:43:23.660
LIST. SELECT THE SELECTION

02:43:23.727 --> 02:43:25.462
PROCESS NEEDS TO ELIMINATE MANY

02:43:25.529 --> 02:43:27.264
QUESTIONS BY COUNSEL AND BY

02:43:27.330 --> 02:43:28.565
JUDGES WHO ATTEMPT TO

02:43:28.632 --> 02:43:30.066
REHABILITATE JURORS WITH

02:43:30.133 --> 02:43:31.902
LEADING QUESTIONS. THAT YOU

02:43:31.968 --> 02:43:32.836

THEIR ABILITY TO BE FAIR AND

02:43:34.471 --> 02:43:36.439

IS TAKING IT A STEP FURTHER- SO

02:57:46.589 --> 02:57:49.025
LONG HELD BELIEF THAT. WE HAVE

02:57:49.091 --> 02:57:50.960
A SYSTEM A PROCESS THAT IS

02:57:51.027 --> 02:57:52.695
FLAWED IS A PROCESS THAT IS

02:57:52.762 --> 02:57:56.665
BASED ON SIMPLY RAW PREJUDICE

02:57:56.732 --> 02:57:58.234
THAT'S WHAT IT'S BASED UPON.

02:57:58.300 --> 02:58:01.070
EACH SIDE EACH SIDE IS TRYING

02:58:01.137 --> 02:58:03.839
TO SKEW THE JURY TO AN OUTCOME

02:58:03.906 --> 02:58:05.274
THAT THEY BELIEVE IT IS IN

02:58:20.623 --> 02:58:21.590
HAPPENS NOW. WHAT DOES IT I DO

02:58:21.657 --> 02:58:23.259
BELIEVE AS IS CHIEF JUSTICE

02:58:23.325 --> 02:58:24.827
GONZALEZ ILLUSTRATED THE NEED

02:58:24.894 --> 02:58:26.929
TO BE FURTHER REFORM IN TERMS

02:58:26.996 --> 02:58:28.898
OF ENLARGING THE VENEER. VERY

02:58:28.964 --> 02:58:30.633
IMPORTANT IN TERMS OF MAKING

02:58:30.699 --> 02:58:33.903
SURE THAT. CHALLENGES FOR CAUSE

WHICH ARE FUNDAMENTALLY BASED

02:58:52.888 --> 02:58:56.659
ON BIAS AND PREJUDICE. I THINK

02:58:56.725 --> 02:59:00.563
WE NEED TO TAKE A STEP FURTHER.

02:59:00.629 --> 02:59:02.264

02:59:48.077 --> 02:59:50.112
CONS AND THERE ARE PROS AND

02:59:50.179 --> 02:59:51.347
CONS TO PEREMPTORY CHALLENGES

02:59:51.413 --> 02:59:53.415
SO I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT

02:59:53.482 --> 02:59:56.118
IT'S IT THAT THERE ARE. ISSUES

02:59:56.185 --> 02:59:57.620
WITH THE SYSTEM AND I'M NOT

02:59:57.686 --> 03:00:00.656
HERE TO SORT OF- CLASS GLANCE

03:00:00.723 --> 03:00:03.225
OVER THAT BUT WITH THAT SAID I

03:00:03.292 --> 03:00:05.828
ALSO DO BELIEVE THAT IT BE

03:00:05.895 --> 03:00:10.299
THIRTY SEVENTY- WAS WAS A

03:00:10.366 --> 03:00:11.200
LANDMARK LAW. I THINK IT'S A

03:00:11.267 --> 03:00:13.802
GOOD LAW DO- IN MY VIEW I'D

03:00:13.869 --> 03:00:15.037
JUST LIKE TO GIVE AN

03:00:15.104 --> 03:00:18.140
OPPORTUNITY. TO BE IMPLEMENTED-

03:00:18.207 --> 03:00:19.975
AND THEN ON THIS BROADER ISSUE

03:00:20.042 --> 03:00:21.844

03:00:21.911 --> 03:00:24.947
REVISIT IT YOU KNOW IF AB

03:00:25.014 --> 03:00:25.514
THIRTY SEVENTY FOR WHATEVER

03:00:25.581 --> 03:00:26.815
REASON ISN'T WORKING I THINK IT

03:00:26.882 --> 03:00:29.318
LIKELY WILL WORK- AS WE'VE

03:00:29.385 --> 03:00:31.921
HEARD FROM WASHINGTON STATE BY-

03:00:31.987 --> 03:00:33.289
I DO WANNA GIVE AN OPPORTUNITY

03:00:33.355 --> 03:00:34.156
SO I WON'T BE ABLE TO SUPPORT

03:00:34.223 --> 03:00:35.791
THE BILL TODAY I DO APPRECIATE

03:00:35.858 --> 03:00:37.893
THE AUTHOR. CONTINUING TO RAISE

03:00:37.960 --> 03:00:41.130

03:00:41.197 --> 03:00:46.101
TO SUPPORT. NO COMMENTS OR

03:00:46.168 --> 03:00:51.840
CONCERNS. SENATOR ULTRABOOK.

03:00:51.907 --> 03:00:54.877
INTERESTING BECAUSE WE HAVE-

03:00:54.944 --> 03:00:56.912

AN ATTORNEY HERE IN THE

03:00:59.982 --> 03:01:00.516
COMMITTEE AND IT'S INTERESTING

03:01:00.583 --> 03:01:03.419
HOW- WE COME UP WITH DIFFERING

03:01:03.485 --> 03:01:05.721
VIEWS AND ANGLES IN IN IN

03:01:05.788 --> 03:01:09.692

THE STATEMENT THAT YOU MADE

03:01:14.196 --> 03:01:17.566
THAT YOU ARE NOT TRYING TO-

03:01:17.633 --> 03:01:19.902
BASICALLY NULLIFIER OR OUT DO

YOU'RE TRYING TO IMPROVE THAT-

03:01:25.641 --> 03:01:26.075
AND JUST MOVE IT A STEP

FURTHER. FASHION AND I IT WAS

03:01:28.510 --> 03:01:31.180

03:01:31.247 --> 03:01:32.748
COMMENTS ON BEHALF OF CHIEF

WOODS- ON THIS ISSUE- OBVIOUSLY

03:01:53.535 --> 03:01:55.838
IS VERY VERY COMPLICATED AND

03:01:55.904 --> 03:01:57.940
BUT I DO APPRECIATE THE INTENT

03:01:58.007 --> 03:01:59.475
OF WHAT YOU'RE DOING IN THIS IN

03:01:59.541 --> 03:02:05.114
THIS BILL AND- WITH THAT INTENT

03:02:05.180 --> 03:02:07.883
OF TRYING TO IMPROVE- A CURRENT

03:02:07.950 --> 03:02:10.653
SYSTEM NOT OUT DOING AB THIRTY

03:02:10.719 --> 03:02:11.253
SEVENTY I WILL BE MORE THAN

03:02:11.320 --> 03:02:13.522
HAPPY TO MOVE. THIS THIS THIS

03:02:13.589 --> 03:02:16.525

TO HOPEFULLY HAVE AN

03:02:17.059 --> 03:02:19.361
OPPORTUNITY TO CONTINUE ITS

03:02:19.428 --> 03:02:21.363
WORK- AND I THINK ULTIMATELY I

03:02:21.430 --> 03:02:24.166
THINK EVERYBODY HAS- THE INTENT

03:02:24.233 --> 03:02:25.734
OF IMPROVING A SYSTEM THAT IS

03:02:25.801 --> 03:02:30.272
FLAWED- AND WITH THAT I RESPECT

03:02:30.339 --> 03:02:34.943
YOUR INTENT- AS THE AUTHOR-

03:02:35.010 --> 03:02:36.145
ADDITION COMMENTER. QUESTIONS

03:02:36.211 --> 03:02:38.314
UPON THIS ROCK. I TWO ONE

03:02:38.380 --> 03:02:40.449
EXPRESS MY APPRECIATION TO THE

03:02:40.516 --> 03:02:42.051
AUTHOR I BELIEVE YOUR

03:02:42.117 --> 03:02:43.552
INTENTIONS ARE GENUINE. BUT

03:02:43.619 --> 03:02:45.387
STATED BY MY OTHER COLLEAGUES I

03:02:45.454 --> 03:02:47.589
THINK THIS MEASURE IS PREMATURE

03:02:47.656 --> 03:02:51.160
OR UNDERSTANDING THAT- AB

03:02:51.226 --> 03:02:52.094
THIRTY SEVENTY DOES NOT EVEN GO

03:02:52.161 --> 03:02:53.862
INTO EFFECT TILL JANUARY OF

03:02:53.929 --> 03:02:55.664
NEXT YEAR AND I THINK IT SHOULD

03:02:55.731 --> 03:02:57.633
HAVE IT STAND THE SUN TO PROVE.

03:02:57.700 --> 03:02:59.501
THAT IT WORKS OR IT CAN IMPROVE

03:02:59.568 --> 03:03:01.637
UPON A SYSTEM IN A PROCESSOR WE

03:03:01.704 --> 03:03:03.972
ALL AGREE IS FLAWED IT'S ALL WE

03:03:04.039 --> 03:03:06.342
ALL AGREE IS BIAS. BUT AT THE

03:03:06.408 --> 03:03:08.143
SAME TIME IT'S MONUMENTAL

03:03:08.210 --> 03:03:11.046
LEGISLATION THAT WE VOTED FOR

03:03:11.113 --> 03:03:12.715
LAST YEAR AND IT SHOULD HAVE

03:03:12.781 --> 03:03:14.817
OPPORTUNITIES- PROVE ITSELF

03:03:14.883 --> 03:03:18.220
WORTHY. BEFORE CHANGING IT AS A

03:03:18.287 --> 03:03:21.223
WHOLE SO THERE ANALYZE MY

03:03:21.290 --> 03:03:26.729
CONCERN HERE- NOT WITH THE.

03:03:26.795 --> 03:03:27.596
INTENT OF THE AUTHOR AND HIS.

03:03:27.663 --> 03:03:28.964
GENUINE COMMITMENT TRY TO OUR

03:03:29.031 --> 03:03:31.500
STARTS- WE WOULD ALL AGREE AS A

03:03:31.567 --> 03:03:34.203
STATED IS FLAWED BUT- IT'S ONE

03:03:34.269 --> 03:03:35.704
THAT I THINK IT'S TIME IS

03:03:35.771 --> 03:03:38.140
HASN'T COME YET. AND FOR THOSE

03:03:38.207 --> 03:03:39.575
REASONS TO I WILL NOT BE

03:03:39.641 --> 03:03:41.710

A CONTINUING CONVERSATION I

03:03:50.753 --> 03:03:51.854
THINK THERE'S A CONVERSATION

FAIR AND EQUITABLE JUSTICE AND

03:04:02.631 --> 03:04:04.400
THOSE WHO MAKE THOSE DECISIONS.

03:04:04.466 --> 03:04:07.603
