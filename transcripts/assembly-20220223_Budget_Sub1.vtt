SO MUCH POVERTY IN THE FIRST

00:25:07.973 --> 00:25:11.943
PLACE. INSTITUTIONAL WORK IS PRE

POVERTY FROM HAPPENING. AND THUS

00:25:16.581 --> 00:25:18.850

00:27:10.128 --> 00:27:11.463
A BIG JOB AND THERE WILL

00:27:11.529 --> 00:27:13.531
INEVITABLY THE SHORTFALLS WHEN

00:27:13.598 --> 00:27:16.601
SO MUCH IS ASKED TO THE SAFETY

00:27:16.668 --> 00:27:18.303
NET. DO THEN NOW TURNS RESEARCH

00:27:18.370 --> 00:27:21.172
OF KEY SAFE NET REFORMS TO

00:27:21.239 --> 00:27:22.774
ADDRESS SOME OF THE SHORTFALL.

00:27:22.841 --> 00:27:24.342
FOR WHICH I'LL MENTION. NUMBER

00:27:24.409 --> 00:27:26.945
ONE. WE NEED TO BETTER SUPPORT

00:27:27.012 --> 00:27:28.680
OVERLOOKED POPULATIONS BUT

00:27:28.747 --> 00:27:31.950
CURRENTLY AREN'T ELIGIBLE. FOR

00:27:32.017 --> 00:27:33.151
ALL THE SAFETY NET BENEFITS THEY

00:27:33.218 --> 00:27:34.652
NEED. NUMBER TWO WE NEED TO

00:27:34.719 --> 00:27:36.621
REDUCE HOUSING INSTABILITY AND

00:27:36.688 --> 00:27:38.089
HOMELESSNESS BY BOLSTERING

00:27:38.156 --> 00:27:40.025
SUPPORT FOR HOUSING IN SECURE

TO SET UP DATA INTEGRATION

00:27:44.195 --> 00:27:45.697
SYSTEMS THAT MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO

00:27:45.764 --> 00:27:48.066
COORDINATE THE DELIVERY OF

00:27:48.133 --> 00:27:49.968
EXISTING SAFETY NET BENEFITS.

00:27:50.035 --> 00:27:51.703
AND NUMBER FOUR WE NEED TO

00:27:51.770 --> 00:27:53.505
ELIMINATE BARRIERS TO SECURING

00:27:53.571 --> 00:27:55.573
SUPPORT AND END STATE

00:27:55.640 --> 00:27:56.541
INTERCEPTION OF DEATH THE

00:27:56.608 --> 00:27:59.210
PREVENTATIVE FROM GETTING THE

00:27:59.277 --> 00:28:01.980

NOT BE FULLY HANDLED VIA THESE

00:28:10.722 --> 00:28:13.958
FORMS A LOAN. THESE TWO PROGRAMS

00:28:14.025 --> 00:28:16.394
ESTABLISHING INCOME AND WEALTH

00:28:16.461 --> 00:28:18.296
FLOORS WOULD MAKE IT POSSIBLE

00:28:18.363 --> 00:28:20.432
FOR EVERYONE EVERYONE TO

00:28:20.498 --> 00:28:22.600
PARTICIPATE IN OUR ECONOMY-

00:28:22.667 --> 00:28:24.235
THERE'S MUCH RESEARCH SHOWING

00:28:24.302 --> 00:28:26.938
THAT CASH TRANSFERS WORK. WE

00:28:27.005 --> 00:28:28.073
NEED TO FURTHER EXPERIMENTALLY

00:28:28.139 --> 00:28:29.707
THIS PARTICULAR TYPES OF

00:28:29.774 --> 00:28:31.576
TRANSFER PROGRAMS TO ENSURE THAT

00:28:31.643 --> 00:28:33.578

ONGOING EXPERIMENTATION WITH TWO

00:28:44.389 --> 00:28:47.692
NEW PROGRAMS. SO WHY IT MIGHT BE

00:28:47.759 --> 00:28:48.359
ASKED WE NEED TO EXPERIMENT WITH

GUARANTEED INCOME AND THE ANSWER

00:28:49.994 --> 00:28:51.763
IS SIMPLE GIVEN FEDERALLY

00:34:41.646 --> 00:34:44.982
THE WITH. IN THE OP. BEFORE IT.

00:34:45.049 --> 00:34:48.820
IS EMAIL. BECAUSE IF WE SAW

00:34:48.886 --> 00:34:50.922
POWER IN. WE CREATE A- FOR THE

00:34:50.988 --> 00:34:52.290
RED OF THE COULD THE- WE KNOW

00:34:52.356 --> 00:34:54.258
THAT HOW. OFTEN THE COUNTRY'S

00:34:54.325 --> 00:34:56.260
GROUND FOR A BIG POWER THAT THAT

00:34:56.327 --> 00:34:57.728
THAT THAT THE CO LOOKS TO ENACT

00:34:57.795 --> 00:34:59.730
IN THIS MOMENT WORK HALTED A

00:34:59.797 --> 00:35:01.599
LITTLE BIT DEEPER IN DO MORE IF

00:35:01.666 --> 00:35:03.601
IT WAS REALLY GRAPPLE WITH THE

00:35:03.668 --> 00:35:05.503
FACT THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO HAVE

00:35:05.570 --> 00:35:07.772
POVERTY. WE SHOULD TOLERATE

00:35:07.839 --> 00:35:09.774
PARTY WE SHOULD OF WORK AROUND

00:35:09.841 --> 00:35:12.143
PARTY WE HAVE THE END IT IS NOT

00:35:12.210 --> 00:35:13.711
CONCLUDE BY SAYING THAT BIG PART

00:35:13.778 --> 00:35:15.713
OF ENDING POVERTY ISN'T JUST AN

00:35:15.780 --> 00:35:17.915
POLICY IT'S AN UNDERSTANDING A

00:35:17.982 --> 00:35:20.351
COUPLE FUNDAMENTAL TRUTH. TRUTH

00:35:20.418 --> 00:35:23.154
NUMBER ONE THE ISSUE IS THAT

00:35:23.221 --> 00:35:24.889
WITH PEOPLE LIVING IN POVERTY

00:35:24.956 --> 00:35:26.491
THAT THE PEOPLE ARE NOT THE

00:35:26.557 --> 00:35:29.427
PROBLEM THAT THE PROSTHESES THAT

00:35:29.494 --> 00:35:31.963
THE POLICIES THAT THE STRUCTURES

00:35:32.029 --> 00:35:33.831
THAT THE WAGES THE LACK OF THE

00:35:33.898 --> 00:35:34.532
LACK OF BARGAINING IN BAD

00:35:34.599 --> 00:35:36.701
AFFORDABLE HOUSING THAT TERRIBLE

00:35:36.767 --> 00:35:38.336
SCHOOLS THAT THE UNSAFE

00:35:38.402 --> 00:35:39.604
NEIGHBORHOOD THE ENVIRONMENTAL

00:35:39.670 --> 00:35:42.907
HAZARDS- BUILDS. THOSE ARE THE

00:35:42.974 --> 00:35:45.610
ISSUE. NOT THE PEOPLE IN NUMBER

00:35:45.676 --> 00:35:47.211
TO OUR PROGRAMS HAVE TO BE

00:35:47.278 --> 00:35:49.313
DESIGNED WITH GETTING AS MUCH

00:35:49.380 --> 00:35:51.582
PEOPLE IN THAT'S POSSIBLE AND

00:35:51.649 --> 00:35:53.484
NOT FROM EXCLUSIONARY LEADS WE

00:35:53.551 --> 00:35:57.255
SHOULD WHAT EVERY SINGLE PERSON

00:35:57.321 --> 00:35:58.990
WHO QUALIFIES FOR BENEFITS. IN

00:35:59.056 --> 00:36:01.826
CALIFORNIA TO EASILY ACCESS

00:36:01.893 --> 00:36:03.628
THOSE BENEFITS IN FACT THERE IS

00:36:03.694 --> 00:36:05.363
THIS A REPORT FROM USC THAT'S

00:36:05.429 --> 00:36:07.965
SPOKE TO THE FACT THAT THE FOLKS

00:36:08.032 --> 00:36:09.567
ACTUALLY. WERE ABLE TO ACCESS

00:36:09.634 --> 00:36:10.368
THE BENEFITS THAT THEY'RE

00:36:10.434 --> 00:36:11.602
ENTITLED TO HAVE A WEDDING

00:36:11.669 --> 00:36:14.372
COUPLE SUB AND BURDENSOME AND

00:36:14.438 --> 00:36:15.573
DIGNITY STRIPPING IN THE

00:36:15.640 --> 00:36:17.608
HUMANIZING. THEY WILL HAVE A

00:36:17.675 --> 00:36:25.082
HUGE. DENT IN POVERTY. THEY GET

00:37:59.710 --> 00:38:02.113
IMPACTS OF EARLY LIFE STRESS AND

00:38:02.179 --> 00:38:03.714
PROPERTY. ADDING TO THE

00:38:03.781 --> 00:38:07.084
CALIFORNIA POVERTY MEASURE IN

00:38:07.151 --> 00:38:08.119
TWENTY NINETEEN AS MANY AS A

00:38:08.185 --> 00:38:09.854
THIRD OF CALIFORNIANS LIVES IN

00:38:09.920 --> 00:38:12.089
POVERTY OR IN NEAR POVERTY. THIS

00:38:12.156 --> 00:38:14.091
IS PARTICULARLY TRUE AS FOR

FAMILIES WITH CHILDREN AS THIS

00:38:15.359 --> 00:38:17.662
PANEL WILL KNOW WELL. SINCE THEN

00:38:17.728 --> 00:38:19.330
COBIT NINETEEN IS ONLY LIKELY TO

00:38:19.397 --> 00:38:21.298
HAVE INCREASED POVERTY AND OTHER

00:38:21.365 --> 00:38:23.034
SIGNIFICANT STRESSORS AND

00:38:23.100 --> 00:38:25.336
INEQUITIES. IN THIS WILL FURTHER

00:38:25.403 --> 00:38:27.371
SEPARATE AT THE TO CALIFORNIA'S

00:38:27.438 --> 00:38:29.273
THE CHAIRMAN ARAMBULA MENTIONED.

00:38:29.340 --> 00:38:31.008
THE SCIENCE TELLS US THAT EARLY

00:38:31.075 --> 00:38:32.810
AND PROLONGED STRESS CAN HAVE A

00:38:32.877 --> 00:38:34.578
SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON LIFE ON

00:38:34.645 --> 00:38:36.981
HEALTH. WE KNOW THIS IN PART

00:38:37.048 --> 00:38:38.683
BECAUSE OF THE LANDMARK BURKE MY

00:38:38.749 --> 00:38:40.184
CHILDHOOD ADVERSITY THAT WAS LED

00:38:40.251 --> 00:38:41.686
BY THE CDC AND BY KAISER

00:38:41.752 --> 00:38:44.155
PERMANENTE A- IN THAT WORK THE

00:38:44.221 --> 00:38:46.957
DEFINED TEN EXPERIENCES. ADVERSE

00:38:47.024 --> 00:38:48.492
CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES OR ACES

00:38:48.559 --> 00:38:51.729
WHICH INCLUDED CHILD ABUSE CHILD

00:38:51.796 --> 00:38:53.064
NEGLECT AND GROWING UP WITH A

00:38:53.130 --> 00:38:54.732
CHALLENGE SUCH AS SOMEBODY IN

00:38:54.799 --> 00:38:55.766
THE HOUSEHOLD FACING

00:38:55.833 --> 00:38:57.668
INCARCERATION WERE UNTREATED

00:38:57.735 --> 00:38:59.603
MENTAL ILLNESS. HE SAYS ARE

00:38:59.670 --> 00:39:02.073
EXTREMELY COMMON THE MAJORITY OF

00:39:02.139 --> 00:39:03.674
US MORE THAN SIX IN TEN

00:39:03.741 --> 00:39:04.842
CALIFORNIANS WILL HAVE

00:39:04.909 --> 00:39:06.510
EXPERIENCED AT LEAST ONE ACE BY

00:39:06.577 --> 00:39:08.779
AGE EIGHTEEN. AND ONE IN SIX OF

00:39:08.846 --> 00:39:12.750
US WILL BE EXPERIENCED. FOUR OR

00:39:12.817 --> 00:39:14.051
MORE ACES. AND WHEN A SAYS A

00:39:14.118 --> 00:39:16.187
WITHOUT STIFF PROTECTIVE FACTORS

00:39:16.253 --> 00:39:17.888
LIKE FOR EXAMPLE SUPPORTED CARE

00:39:17.955 --> 00:39:19.290
GIVING. A WHOLE SET OF

00:39:19.356 --> 00:39:20.991
BIOLOGICAL CHANGES CAN GET SET

00:39:21.058 --> 00:39:23.360
INTO MOTION CALLED THE TOXIC

00:39:23.427 --> 00:39:25.796
STRESS RESPONSE. TOXIC STRESS

00:39:25.863 --> 00:39:28.165
DESCRIBES ALTERATIONS IN BRAIN

00:39:28.232 --> 00:39:29.734
STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION IN

00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:32.169
HORMONAL REGULATION IN METABOLIC

00:39:32.236 --> 00:39:34.004
PROCESS SEES IN THE IMMUNE

00:39:34.071 --> 00:39:36.273
RESPONSE AND IN THE WAY THAT

00:39:36.340 --> 00:39:38.209
CELLS IN BODIES AGE. THESE

00:39:38.275 --> 00:39:39.777
BIOLOGICAL CHANGES CAN BECOME

00:39:39.844 --> 00:39:41.212
INCLUDED INTO THE WAY THAT OUR

00:39:41.278 --> 00:39:43.147
GENES ARE READ AND EVEN PASSED

00:39:43.214 --> 00:39:45.382
DOWN FROM ONE GENERATION TO THE

00:39:45.449 --> 00:39:47.084
NEXT. SO HE SAYS IN THE

00:39:47.151 --> 00:39:48.719
RESULTING TOXIC STRESS RESPONSE

00:39:48.786 --> 00:39:51.455
THAT CAN OCCUR OR A ROOT CAUSE

00:39:51.522 --> 00:39:53.190
TOO MANY OF THE MOST COMMON

00:39:53.257 --> 00:39:55.626
SERIOUS AND COSTLY HEALTH

00:39:55.693 --> 00:39:57.361
CHALLENGES THAT WE FACE TODAY.

00:39:57.428 --> 00:39:59.663
THIS INCLUDES NINE OUT OF TEN OF

00:39:59.730 --> 00:40:01.031
THE LEADING CAUSES OF DEATH

00:40:01.098 --> 00:40:03.167
NATIONALLY. SUCH AS HEART

00:40:03.234 --> 00:40:06.504
DISEASE CANCER DIABETES AS WELL

00:40:06.570 --> 00:40:08.472
AS SIGNIFICANT DISPARITIES IN

00:40:08.539 --> 00:40:10.341
LIFE EXPECTANCY AND HEALTH CARE

00:40:10.407 --> 00:40:13.377
COSTS. SO WHILE POVERTY WAS NOT

00:40:13.444 --> 00:40:15.746
ONE OF THE ORIGINAL TEN PIECES

00:40:15.813 --> 00:40:18.115
POVERTY IS CERTAINLY A PROFOUND

00:40:18.182 --> 00:40:20.184
DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH. AND IT'S

00:40:20.251 --> 00:40:22.119
A RISK FACTOR BOTH FOR PIECES

00:40:22.186 --> 00:40:23.954
OCCURRING AND INDEPENDENTLY FOR

00:40:24.021 --> 00:40:26.524
TOXIC STRESS AS WELL. AND WHEN

00:40:26.590 --> 00:40:27.825
WE TALK ABOUT CASES AFFECTING

00:40:27.892 --> 00:40:30.461
ALL COMMUNITIES WE DO KNOW THAT

00:40:30.528 --> 00:40:32.062
BECAUSE OF SIGNIFICANT SOCIAL

00:40:32.129 --> 00:40:34.031
AND STRUCTURAL INEQUITIES SOME

00:40:34.098 --> 00:40:35.266
POPULATIONS ARE AFFECTED

00:40:35.332 --> 00:40:37.334
DISPROPORTIONATELY. BREAK FOR

00:40:37.401 --> 00:40:38.269
INSTANCE FAMILIES WHO LIVE IN

00:40:38.335 --> 00:40:40.504
POVERTY ALMOST TWICE AS LIKELY

00:40:40.571 --> 00:40:42.506
TO EXPERIENCE HE SAYS AND OTHER

00:40:42.573 --> 00:40:44.575
ADVERSITIES IN ADDITION TO BEING

00:40:44.642 --> 00:40:46.010
LESS LIKELY TO HAVE ACCESS TO

00:40:46.076 --> 00:40:48.245
THE KINDS OF RESOURCES NEEDED TO

00:40:48.312 --> 00:40:50.981
REALLY PREVENT THOSE ACES FROM

00:40:51.048 --> 00:40:52.183
LEADING TO TOXIC STRESS. SO

00:40:52.249 --> 00:40:54.285
POVERTY CAN NOT ONLY AMPLIFY THE

00:40:54.351 --> 00:40:55.586
IMPACT OF BASIS BUT HE SAYS MAKE

00:40:55.653 --> 00:40:57.621
IT MORE LIKELY THAT A PERSON

00:40:57.688 --> 00:40:59.924
WILL SUFFER FROM CHALLENGES LIKE

00:40:59.990 --> 00:41:01.525
POVERTY HOMELESSNESS AND

00:41:01.592 --> 00:41:04.295
INCARCERATION. WE ALSO KNOW THAT

00:41:04.361 --> 00:41:05.796
POVERTY CAN INDUCE SIGNIFICANT

00:41:05.863 --> 00:41:08.132
STRESS ON A DAILY BASIS AND CAN

00:41:08.199 --> 00:41:10.768
LEAD THEIR BY TO THE TOXIC

00:41:10.835 --> 00:41:12.937
STRESS RESPONSE IN AND OF ITSELF

00:41:13.003 --> 00:41:14.638
. FORTUNATELY ONCE WE HAVE A

00:41:14.705 --> 00:41:17.107
TOXIC STRESS RESPONSE IN PLACE

00:41:17.174 --> 00:41:18.909
WE CAN ACTUALLY TREAT IT AS A

00:41:18.976 --> 00:41:19.610
HEALTH CONDITION. AND SEVEN

00:41:19.677 --> 00:41:22.246

TWENTY TWENTY CALIFORNIA

SHOULD OF THROUGH WHICH

00:41:25.316 --> 00:41:27.818
CLINICIANS WILL RECEIVE TRAINING

00:41:27.885 --> 00:41:30.254
CLINICAL TOOLS AND PROTOCOLS AND

00:41:30.321 --> 00:41:32.923

ASSOCIATED WITH EAST AS- THE

00:41:36.794 --> 00:41:39.196
TREATMENTS THAT WE RECOMMEND

00:41:39.263 --> 00:41:40.431
BETTER EVIDENCE BASED INCLUDE

00:41:40.497 --> 00:41:42.233

CASE LOAD BUT WE ANTICIPATE THAT

01:07:39.121 --> 01:07:41.824
WE WILL SEE THAT INCREASE I ONCE

YOU THINK IT BE HELPFUL TO

PROVIDE A LITTLE BIT OF CONTEXT

01:13:26.201 --> 01:13:28.103
ON ONE OF THE QUESTIONS THAT THE

01:13:28.170 --> 01:13:28.904
- IT MINISTRATIONS JUST

01:13:28.971 --> 01:13:31.607
ADDRESSED- THAT BEING ABOUT THE

01:13:31.673 --> 01:13:32.241
CASE OF DYNAMICS IN THIS

01:13:32.307 --> 01:13:35.577
PROGRAM. I KNOW THIS IS BEEN. A

01:13:35.644 --> 01:13:37.846
CONTRAST TO THE LEGISLATURE IN

01:13:37.913 --> 01:13:39.448
GENERAL TO THE SUBCOMMITTEE IN

01:13:39.515 --> 01:13:42.651
PARTICULAR AS IT HAS BEEN TO OUR

01:13:42.718 --> 01:13:46.822
OFFICE. THE CONTEXT IS THAT

01:13:46.889 --> 01:13:48.991
HISTORICALLY WE EXPECT THEM ONE

01:13:49.057 --> 01:13:50.726
ECONOMIC CONDITIONS ARE FOR THAT

01:13:50.793 --> 01:13:53.729
IN. SPECIFICALLY WHEN

01:13:53.796 --> 01:13:55.464
UNEMPLOYMENT IS HIGH THE

01:13:55.531 --> 01:13:57.733
CASELOAD FOR CAL WORKS AND OTHER

01:13:57.800 --> 01:13:59.668
SAFETY NET PROGRAMS WILL GROW BY

01:13:59.735 --> 01:14:01.804
US OUR OFFICE IN THE

01:14:01.870 --> 01:14:04.673
ADMINISTRATION WERE PROJECTING

01:14:04.740 --> 01:14:07.075
LARGE CASELOAD INCREASES- AS A

01:14:07.142 --> 01:14:11.180
RESULT OF THE ECONOMIC RECESSION

01:14:11.246 --> 01:14:12.014
FOLLOWING THE PANDEMIC LAST

01:14:12.080 --> 01:14:16.051
YEAR- NOW ACTUALLY TWO YEARS

01:14:16.118 --> 01:14:18.287
AGO- BUT- THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN

01:14:18.353 --> 01:14:20.155
WHAT WE SAW WAS A TEMPORARY

01:14:20.222 --> 01:14:21.790
INCREASE THAT SEEM TO BE. AS

01:14:21.857 --> 01:14:24.526
PRIMARILY BY SOME POLICY CHANGES

01:14:24.593 --> 01:14:25.093
IN THE FIRST COUPLE MONTHS

01:14:25.160 --> 01:14:27.262
FOLLOWED BY LOVE PRECIPITOUS

01:14:27.329 --> 01:14:29.832
DROP THAT REALLY HAS NO PARALLEL

01:14:29.898 --> 01:14:31.166
THROUGHOUT THE HISTORY OF CAL

01:14:31.233 --> 01:14:33.769
WORKS- WE ENDED UP WITH THE

01:14:33.836 --> 01:14:36.071
LOWEST CASELOAD IN THE PROGRAM'S

01:14:36.138 --> 01:14:39.308
HISTORY- SOMEWHERE AROUND THREE

01:14:39.374 --> 01:14:42.044
HUNDRED THOUSAND FAMILIES- AS OF

01:14:42.110 --> 01:14:46.381
LAST SUMMER. NOW THIS OF COURSE

01:14:46.448 --> 01:14:48.684
WAS A CONCERN FOR THE

01:14:48.750 --> 01:14:50.352
LEGISLATURE FOR THE RESTORATION

01:14:50.419 --> 01:14:52.387
PROCESS IN PART BECAUSE WE

01:14:52.454 --> 01:14:54.423
WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS

01:14:54.489 --> 01:14:56.925
PROGRAM IS REACHING AS MANY

01:14:56.992 --> 01:14:59.094
ELIGIBLE FAMILIES AS POSSIBLE IS

01:14:59.161 --> 01:15:00.429
ALSO A CHALLENGE BECAUSE WE'RE

01:15:00.495 --> 01:15:03.098
TASKED WITH PROJECTING HOW MUCH

01:15:03.165 --> 01:15:04.833
THIS PROGRAM IS GOING TO COST SO

01:15:04.900 --> 01:15:07.202
IT'S JUST A MATTER OF PROPER

01:15:07.269 --> 01:15:10.205
FORECASTING- SAID THAT AND FOR

01:15:10.272 --> 01:15:12.674
OUR OFFICE IN THE ADMINISTRATION

01:15:12.741 --> 01:15:14.176
INDEPENDENTLY INVESTIGATED. THE

01:15:14.243 --> 01:15:15.811
POTENTIAL CAUSES OF THIS AND I

01:15:15.878 --> 01:15:17.212
THINK REALLY THROUGH A PROCESS

01:15:17.279 --> 01:15:19.615
OF ELIMINATION WE BOTH CAME TO

01:15:19.681 --> 01:15:20.749
THE CONCLUSION THAT THE MOST

01:15:20.816 --> 01:15:23.018
LIKELY CAUSE OF THIS DYNAMIC HAS

01:15:23.085 --> 01:15:25.287
TO DO WITH THE EXCEPTIONAL OF

01:15:25.354 --> 01:15:26.388
FINANCIAL SUPPORT THAT'S BEEN

01:15:26.455 --> 01:15:28.190
OFFERED BY THE STATE AND FEDERAL

01:15:28.257 --> 01:15:30.092
GOVERNMENTS- THROUGHOUT THE

01:15:30.158 --> 01:15:32.261
PANDEMIC OKAY AN EXAMPLE OF THIS

01:15:32.327 --> 01:15:33.962
WOULD BE THE EXPANDED

01:15:34.029 --> 01:15:36.231
UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE WHICH NOW

01:15:36.298 --> 01:15:38.033
REACHES MORE PEOPLE THAN IT USED

01:15:38.100 --> 01:15:39.101
TO AND FOR A LONG TIME WAS

01:15:39.167 --> 01:15:41.603
OFFERING A REALLY SUBSTANTIAL

01:15:41.670 --> 01:15:45.874
BONUS- DOES YOUR Y. BENEFITS-

01:15:45.941 --> 01:15:48.043
LAPSED LAST SEPTEMBER AND SO

01:15:48.110 --> 01:15:51.280
BOTH OF OUR BOTH OUR OFFICE AND

01:15:51.346 --> 01:15:53.248
THE ADMINISTRATION PROJECTED.

01:15:53.315 --> 01:15:53.949
MAYBE THAT WOULD BE THE

01:15:54.016 --> 01:15:55.484
INFLECTION POINT THE POINT AT

01:15:55.550 --> 01:15:56.952
WHICH CASE THAT BEGAN TO GROW

01:15:57.019 --> 01:16:00.188
AGAIN IN LINE WITH OUR HISTORIC

01:16:00.255 --> 01:16:02.557
EXPECTATIONS FINANCIAL DATA WE

01:16:02.624 --> 01:16:04.226
NOW HAVE THROUGH DECEMBER OF

01:16:04.293 --> 01:16:06.962
LAST YEAR AT LEAST IN PART IT

01:16:07.029 --> 01:16:08.730
DOES SUGGEST THAT SEPTEMBER OF

01:16:08.797 --> 01:16:10.098
LAST YEAR WAS AN INFLECTION

01:16:10.165 --> 01:16:11.934
POINT FOR CASE THOUGH THAT WE

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.202
DID SEE RESUMES GROWTH AFTER

01:16:14.269 --> 01:16:17.172
MANY MONTHS OF DECLINE BUT TODAY

01:16:17.239 --> 01:16:18.607
THAT GROWTH APPEARS RATHER

01:16:18.674 --> 01:16:20.042
MODEST SOMEWHERE IN THE

01:16:20.108 --> 01:16:21.843
NEIGHBORHOOD OF TWO THOUSAND

01:16:21.910 --> 01:16:24.313

IN THE ADMINISTRATION PROJECTED

01:16:25.781 --> 01:16:27.316
SOMETHING CLOSER TO TEN THOUSAND

01:16:27.382 --> 01:16:32.287
CASES. PER MONTH. NOW ONE

01:16:32.354 --> 01:16:34.589
POSSIBLE. WHY WE'RE SAYING

01:16:34.656 --> 01:16:36.692
GROWTH THERE THAT THERE STILL.

01:16:36.758 --> 01:16:39.394
WAS SOME. EIGHT AND- TAKES CHILD

01:16:48.136 --> 01:16:49.738
SEE A SLOW GROW AT AN EVEN

01:16:49.805 --> 01:16:54.943

THAT JOURNEY ALMOST SEVENTEEN

01:21:35.757 --> 01:21:38.293
YEARS AGO I WAS TERRIFIED

01:21:38.360 --> 01:21:40.595

HELP TO SUPPORT ME AND WHAT THEY

01:22:29.911 --> 01:22:31.646

. MY EXPERIENCE WITH CAL WORKS

01:22:43.925 --> 01:22:45.293
DEMONSTRATES THAT THERE IS A

01:22:45.360 --> 01:22:46.561
SYSTEM THAT WORKS FOR SOME

01:22:46.628 --> 01:22:49.431
PEOPLE. OUR SYSTEM INVOLVES

HAD WITH CAO WORKS UNFORTUNATELY

01:23:01.910 --> 01:23:03.211

FANS. GALLERY STORY REPRESENTS

01:23:12.687 --> 01:23:14.222

PARENTS FACE WHEN TRYING TO

01:23:15.790 --> 01:23:18.393

. AND AS A FORMER CAL WORKS

01:23:46.221 --> 01:23:48.423
RECIPIENT. VALERIE WAS ALREADY

01:23:48.490 --> 01:23:50.325
ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE THE STAGE TO

01:23:50.392 --> 01:23:52.527
CHILD CARE SHE NEEDED TO GET

01:23:52.594 --> 01:23:53.895
BACK ON HER FEET. HOWEVER SHE

01:23:53.962 --> 01:23:55.697
WAS TOLD THAT SHE NEEDED TO

01:23:55.764 --> 01:23:57.465
REAPPLY AND ENDED UP WAITING

01:23:57.532 --> 01:23:59.267
MONTHS SUBMITTING A MOUNTAIN OF

PHONE SYSTEMS WERE CALLS WERE

01:24:05.306 --> 01:24:07.642
NEVER ANSWERED. AFTER MONTHS

01:24:07.709 --> 01:24:09.778
WITH NO REYES RESOLUTION SHE

01:24:09.844 --> 01:24:13.214
GAVE UP. VALERIE DIDN'T BAIL THE

01:24:13.281 --> 01:24:16.451
SYSTEM DID. THIS IS NOT THE

01:24:16.518 --> 01:24:18.820
SYSTEM THAT WE NEED. THIS IS THE

01:24:18.887 --> 01:24:19.921
SYSTEM WE WALKED. BUT THIS IS A

01:24:19.988 --> 01:24:21.556
SYSTEM THAT IS FAILING FAR TOO

01:24:21.623 --> 01:24:23.725
MANY FAMILIES. WE HAVE TO FACE

01:24:23.792 --> 01:24:26.294
THE FACT THAT THERE IS RACISM IN

01:24:26.361 --> 01:24:28.930
THE SYSTEM. I CANNOT IGNORE THAT

01:24:28.997 --> 01:24:31.766
MY EXPERIENCE AS A WHITE MOTHER.

01:24:31.833 --> 01:24:34.235
WAS SO DIFFERENT FROM VALERIE'S

01:24:34.302 --> 01:24:36.004
AS A BLACK MAN. MANY OF OUR

01:24:36.070 --> 01:24:37.705
MEMBERS TODAY HAVE TO GO THROUGH

01:24:37.772 --> 01:24:39.808
A METAL DETECTOR. AND THE FIRST

01:24:39.874 --> 01:24:41.543
PERSON THAT THEY SEE AND COME IN

01:24:41.609 --> 01:24:44.412
CONTACT WITH IS A SECURITY GUARD

01:24:44.479 --> 01:24:46.548
. MY FIRST CONTACT WAS WITH A

01:24:46.614 --> 01:24:49.784
SOCIAL WORKER READY TO HELP. LET

01:24:49.851 --> 01:24:51.519
ME LOOK AT HOW OUR PROGRAMS ARE

01:24:51.586 --> 01:24:53.388
DESIGNED WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT

01:24:53.455 --> 01:24:54.556
THEIR STRUCTURE TO MEET THE

01:24:54.622 --> 01:24:56.591
NEEDS OF THOSE WITH THE MOST

01:24:56.658 --> 01:24:58.827
CHALLENGES WHEN IT ENGLISH

01:24:58.893 --> 01:25:00.862
SPEAKING MASTER DEGREE HOLDEN

01:25:00.929 --> 01:25:02.564

ON A VARIETY OF POLICY COUNCIL.

01:25:07.335 --> 01:25:09.504
CAN'T FIGURE IT OUT. NEARLY THE

01:25:09.571 --> 01:25:11.339
SYSTEM IS FAILING WHEN WE MEET

01:25:11.406 --> 01:25:13.274
THE NEEDS OF OUR MOST VULNERABLE

01:25:13.341 --> 01:25:16.311
PARENTS WE MEET THE NEEDS OF ALL

01:25:16.377 --> 01:25:18.680
PARENTS. AND THAT MAKE ISN'T. TO

01:25:18.746 --> 01:25:21.216
REBUILD AND RE CREATE SYSTEMS

01:25:21.282 --> 01:25:23.184
THAT ACTUALLY WORK FOR FAMILIES

01:25:23.251 --> 01:25:25.186
BUT IN ORDER TO DO THAT IT HAS

TO OTHER. THAT IF YOU'RE THAT

01:28:11.619 --> 01:28:15.123
THEY WERE BE IN. TO FOR OF THE

01:28:15.189 --> 01:28:16.691
LIGHT BULBS BUT WORK. I THINK

01:28:16.758 --> 01:28:20.628
THIS IS THE ISN'T POSTED OVER-

01:28:20.695 --> 01:28:24.632
AND I THINK- SEE THIS- BUT SHE-

01:28:24.699 --> 01:28:27.068
OF ARC. APPROACH IN THE NUMBER

01:28:27.135 --> 01:28:32.840
OF- OKAY JUST RATES BY MINUTES

01:28:32.907 --> 01:28:36.811
FOR EXAMPLE ON. THIS PLEDGE. AND

01:28:36.878 --> 01:28:39.013
MANY GOVERNOR HAVE WORKED. TO

01:28:39.080 --> 01:28:46.554
MEDIC. OF RATE. I'M MORE OF.

01:28:46.621 --> 01:28:48.656
RECENT YEARS ESPECIALLY WITH THE

01:28:48.723 --> 01:28:51.125
EXPANSION OF CALPERS STUDENT. AT

01:28:51.192 --> 01:28:54.328
THE SITE WHICH BAND. AND BUT

01:28:54.395 --> 01:28:56.364
WHEN WE COME TO CAL WORKS. I

01:28:56.431 --> 01:28:57.932
KNOWLEDGE THAT WE DON'T HAVE

01:28:57.999 --> 01:29:00.101
RECENT DATA FROM EIGHTY UP ON

01:29:00.168 --> 01:29:05.807
THIS ISSUE- BUT THE- PUT THERE'S

01:29:05.873 --> 01:29:06.708
REASON TO THINK THAT ARE THAT

01:29:06.774 --> 01:29:09.844
ARE PERFORMANCE ISSUES DROPPING

01:29:09.911 --> 01:29:13.881
. WE WERE. ADELINE 6% OF THE- OF

01:29:13.948 --> 01:29:15.950
THE- OF THE NUMBER OF FAMILIES

01:29:16.017 --> 01:29:18.286
WHO ARE ELIGIBLE- AND WE WANT TO

01:29:18.352 --> 01:29:19.654
TALK STATES IN THE COUNTRY AND

01:29:19.721 --> 01:29:20.722
THAT WE'VE MAINTAINED OUR OUR

01:29:20.788 --> 01:29:23.024
PERSPIRATION RATE STRONGLY. BUT

01:29:23.091 --> 01:29:24.125
WITH THIS RECENT DROP IN THE

01:29:24.192 --> 01:29:25.993
CASE OF THE WE'VE SEEN OVER THE

01:29:26.060 --> 01:29:27.161
LAST COUPLE OF YEARS. WE HAVE

01:29:27.228 --> 01:29:30.131
REASON TO THINK ABOUT NUMBERS

01:29:30.198 --> 01:29:34.168
NOW DROP. PUBLISHED BELOW 50%

01:29:34.235 --> 01:29:35.470
THE AMERICAN AREA THAT WE THINK

01:29:35.536 --> 01:29:37.505
THE WORK THAT THE LEGISLATURE BE

01:29:37.572 --> 01:29:39.674
THANK A VERY STRONG LOOK AT I

01:29:39.741 --> 01:29:41.442
THINK THIS IDEA OF AN SO CALLED

01:29:41.509 --> 01:29:43.044
NO WAY POLICY FOR GETTING PEOPLE

01:29:43.111 --> 01:29:44.645
IN THE TOWERS IT'S SOMETHING

01:29:44.712 --> 01:29:46.514
THAT WE OUGHT TO BE THINKING

01:29:46.581 --> 01:29:47.849
SERIOUSLY ABOUT DOING. BUT

01:29:47.915 --> 01:29:48.883
THERE'S ALSO A NUMBER OF THINGS

01:29:48.950 --> 01:29:51.486
THAT WE COULD BE DOING THAT- TO

01:29:51.552 --> 01:29:53.821
ADDRESS OTHER BARRIERS TO

01:29:53.888 --> 01:29:55.790
GETTING ON TO CHALLENGE THAT I'M

01:29:55.857 --> 01:29:58.025
MORE PREFIX SIMPLY BY HAVING YOU

01:29:58.092 --> 01:30:00.428
KNOW ONE MORE POLICY SO YOU'VE

01:30:00.495 --> 01:30:01.996
HEARD ME SAY SOME OF THESE

01:30:02.063 --> 01:30:03.297
BEFORE BUT I WILL TAKE THEIR

01:30:03.364 --> 01:30:05.967
REPEATED I BELIEVE SOME WE

01:30:06.033 --> 01:30:07.935
SHOULD A WOMAN THE CALLED THE IN

01:30:08.002 --> 01:30:10.071
THE FACT THAT THE MEN WILL BE

01:30:10.138 --> 01:30:13.674
STANDARDS ADEQUATE. WHICH IS A-

01:30:13.741 --> 01:30:14.842
ALL MEDICATIONS HOW MUCH INCOME

01:30:14.909 --> 01:30:17.011
PEOPLE CAN HAPPEN A FIVE FOR THE

01:30:17.078 --> 01:30:18.479
PROGRAM CURRENTLY A FAMILY CAN

01:30:18.546 --> 01:30:21.349
ONLY MAKE A FAMILY 310-005-0030

01:30:21.415 --> 01:30:23.151
NINE DOLLARS A MONTH IN ORDER TO

01:30:23.217 --> 01:30:24.652
BECOME ELIGIBLE FOR THE PROGRAM

01:30:24.719 --> 01:30:27.121
THAT'S ABOUT 80% OF THE FEDERAL

01:30:27.188 --> 01:30:32.593
POVERTY LEVEL RIGHT. NOW SO

01:30:32.660 --> 01:30:33.594
WE'RE LEAVING. SIGNIFICANT NOT

01:30:33.661 --> 01:30:35.129
OF PEOPLE IN POVERTY UNABLE TO

01:30:35.196 --> 01:30:37.231
ACT IS FOR. BECAUSE WE HAVE THIS

01:30:37.298 --> 01:30:39.734
ARE. AMONGST WE GET RID OF THE

01:30:39.801 --> 01:30:42.069
OF A CATS. ON THEIR A BILL ON

01:30:42.136 --> 01:30:44.839
THE LINE. NOW TO DO THAT ON THE

01:30:44.906 --> 01:30:47.208
TABLE. OF ONE HUNDRED HOUR WAR.

01:30:47.275 --> 01:30:50.278
KNOWN AGAIN THIS IS A THIS IS

01:30:50.344 --> 01:30:52.113
JUST A ARTIST BARRIER THAT WE

01:30:52.180 --> 01:30:53.114
CREATED. THAT MAKES IT REALLY

01:30:53.181 --> 01:30:54.048
HARD FOR PEOPLE TO GET ON OUR

01:30:54.115 --> 01:30:58.119
PROGRAM- IT AT. WE SHOULD BE

01:30:58.186 --> 01:31:03.658
THINKING ABOUT- ALL MOVING AWAY

01:31:03.724 --> 01:31:04.992
AS FROM WORK REQUIREMENTS AND

01:31:05.059 --> 01:31:08.196
RICHARD REPORTING REQUIREMENTS-

01:31:08.262 --> 01:31:09.664
MAYOR TOM JOHNSON EARLIER THAT

01:31:09.730 --> 01:31:11.032
THIS MIGHT SOUND A LITTLE

01:31:11.098 --> 01:31:13.367
RADICAL- WE DON'T THINK IT'S

01:31:13.434 --> 01:31:15.636
REALLY THAT RADICAL AT ALL- WE

01:31:15.703 --> 01:31:17.171
THINK THAT THE DAYS WHERE WE

01:31:17.238 --> 01:31:18.739
HAVE THE ONE THAT'S VERY STRICT

01:31:18.806 --> 01:31:22.343
COMPLIANCE PROGRAM IS JUST NOT-

01:31:22.410 --> 01:31:24.345
IT COMPORTS WITH THE REALITY OF

01:31:24.412 --> 01:31:26.747
CURRENT LIGHT PEOPLE HAVE MANY

01:31:26.814 --> 01:31:28.616
OPTIONS THEY DIDN'T HAVE BEFORE

01:31:28.683 --> 01:31:31.786
PEOPLE CAN GET A DRY A JOB-

01:31:31.853 --> 01:31:33.421
DELIVERED COMMUTER WORKING FOR

01:31:33.487 --> 01:31:34.889
UBER THEY CAN MAKE MONEY THEY

01:31:34.956 --> 01:31:36.557
DON'T NEED TO JUMP THROUGH ALL

01:31:36.624 --> 01:31:38.092
THESE HOOPS THAT WE CREATED AT

01:31:38.159 --> 01:31:40.294
THE COUNTY LEVEL THAT MAKE IT SO

01:31:40.361 --> 01:31:41.863
HARD FOR PEOPLE TO STAY ON THE

01:31:41.929 --> 01:31:43.464
BOOKS AND- PEOPLE. ARE WILLING

01:31:43.531 --> 01:31:45.132
TO DO THAT AS MUCH ANYMORE THE

01:31:45.199 --> 01:31:46.901

01:31:51.072 --> 01:31:52.940
PEOPLE JUST AREN'T WILLING TO

01:31:53.007 --> 01:31:55.910

ADDITIONALLY- ALL. WE ALSO THINK

01:32:06.487 --> 01:32:08.189

OUR APPLICATIONS A RESULT OF

01:35:24.985 --> 01:35:26.620
THAT. AND THEN AGAIN A MUCH

01:35:26.687 --> 01:35:28.856
LARGER INCREASE AT THE- END OF

THE YEAR Y. EXTENSIONS AND

01:35:30.658 --> 01:35:32.493
INCREASES THAT HAPPENED. NEAR

THE END OF LAST YEAR WE IN FACT

01:35:34.728 --> 01:35:37.631
WENT FROM AN AVERAGE OF AROUND

01:35:37.698 --> 01:35:38.632
EIGHT THOUSAND APPLICATIONS PER

01:35:38.699 --> 01:35:40.968
WEEK. AT THE BEGINNING A LITTLE

01:35:41.035 --> 01:35:42.536
BIT BEFORE THE PANDEMIC WHICH

THAT COUNTIES RUNNING. HOW SO

01:36:15.769 --> 01:36:18.906
IT'S NOT UNUSUAL TO SEE. A

01:36:18.973 --> 01:36:30.084

BECAUSE TO WORK IN IN. THEIR WAY

HELP CAN HIM SO WE CAN CAN. TO

01:37:40.621 --> 01:37:42.590
MAKE SOME OF THE ADDITION CHANGE

01:37:42.656 --> 01:37:47.194
. THAT OR- THAT MR AND- WHICH

01:37:47.261 --> 01:37:49.163
ALSO THINK WE THINK ABOUT

SOMEBODY OVER OR- THAT ARE

01:37:51.865 --> 01:37:53.634

THAT THEY IN THE CAN BE THE

01:37:58.906 --> 01:38:00.708
FIFTEEN FROM THE PRO- WE'RE- OF

01:38:00.774 --> 01:38:02.476
WHAT IT'S A AREN'T. IT'S MORE OF

01:38:02.543 --> 01:38:04.945
A THIS PAPERWORK FOR. SIMILAR TO

01:38:05.012 --> 01:38:13.053
THE VERY. REQUIRED. TO FIND TO

01:38:13.120 --> 01:38:14.655
THE LONGER REQUIRE THOSE. ONE OF

01:38:14.722 --> 01:38:16.023
THE THING I THINK WE WANT TO

01:38:16.090 --> 01:38:16.991
ABOUT THAT IS THAT THERE ARE A

01:38:17.057 --> 01:38:18.892
PRO THAT OF OUR- ARE L. FOR.

01:38:18.959 --> 01:38:20.361
CALFRESH AND CAL AND THOSE DO

01:38:20.427 --> 01:38:22.162
YOU HAVE YOU GET VERIFICATION

01:38:22.229 --> 01:38:23.864
REQUIREMENTS SO WANT TO ABOUT.

01:38:23.931 --> 01:38:26.200
ARE WE ABLE TO MAKE. IN THOSE

01:38:26.267 --> 01:38:28.002
PROGRAMS ESPECIALLY HEALTH

01:38:28.068 --> 01:38:29.637
RIGHTS WHICH HAS BEEN PRETTY

01:38:29.703 --> 01:38:31.438
STRINGENT FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS

01:38:31.505 --> 01:38:33.107
AND I'LL TALK ABOUT THAT A

01:38:33.173 --> 01:38:34.375
LITTLE BIT ON THE CALFRESH PANEL

01:38:34.441 --> 01:38:36.644
IN A WHILE SOME IDEAS THAT WE

01:38:36.710 --> 01:38:39.513
HAVE- THAT THE STATE HAS BEEN

01:38:39.580 --> 01:38:41.081
WORKING WITH THE WORK GROUP TO

01:38:41.148 --> 01:38:42.750
THINK ABOUT. THAT WOULD REQUIRE

01:38:42.816 --> 01:38:44.918
SOME FEDERAL CHANGES IN THE

01:38:44.985 --> 01:38:47.154
CALFRESH PROGRAM HEALTHWORKS WE

01:38:47.221 --> 01:38:49.056
COULD MAKE THOSE CHANGES. AND

01:38:49.123 --> 01:38:50.024
THEN WE'D BE OPERATING TWO

01:38:50.090 --> 01:38:52.059
DIFFERENT SETS OF RULES AND WE

01:38:52.126 --> 01:38:53.560
JUST HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THE

01:38:53.627 --> 01:38:54.461
COMPLEXITIES THAT THAT MIGHT

01:38:54.528 --> 01:38:58.699
INTRODUCED FOR FAMILIES. OR FOR

01:38:58.766 --> 01:38:59.566
OUR WORKERS. HISTORICALLY I

01:38:59.633 --> 01:39:01.168
THINK OF THIS BOILS DOWN TO OUR

01:39:01.235 --> 01:39:04.438
PRO. IS PRETTY TOGETHER HALF-

01:39:04.505 --> 01:39:07.174
BEFORE THE NIGHT NINETIES- ONE

01:39:07.241 --> 01:39:09.843
REFORM STAFF. WERE ENACTED THE

01:39:09.910 --> 01:39:11.779
THING EVEN. YOU KNOW IT WOULD

01:39:11.845 --> 01:39:14.648
NOW THAT WE GOT POWER. WITH A

01:39:14.715 --> 01:39:17.251
STARK HAD A VERY. OR SISTER. AND

01:39:17.318 --> 01:39:20.354
WE KNOW THAT THAT IS. IN CLASSES

01:39:20.421 --> 01:39:24.992
FACT THIS AND RACIST- RULES OF-

01:39:25.059 --> 01:39:26.393
YOU KNOW COUNTY THE NUMBER OF.

01:39:26.460 --> 01:39:31.665
IN THE- AND- VIEWING PARENTS WHO

01:39:31.732 --> 01:39:34.001
LIVING POVERTY AS SOME. I'M NOT

01:39:34.068 --> 01:39:35.602
ABLE TO CARE FOR THEIR- THESE

01:39:35.669 --> 01:39:37.938
ARE THINGS THAT ARE ECHOES FACT

01:39:38.005 --> 01:39:40.607
YOU SEE. OUR AND I HELLO WE BEEN

01:39:40.674 --> 01:39:43.711
A TO MAKE THE- STRIDES. THERE'S

01:39:43.777 --> 01:39:46.146
MORE TO IT MORNING. AS WE REALLY

01:39:46.213 --> 01:39:47.548
LOOK FORWARD TO. AGAIN YOUR

01:39:47.614 --> 01:39:50.784
STUFF. ON AS WELL. THAT AND HAVE

01:39:50.851 --> 01:39:53.921
A KID. TO REALLY BUILD OUT AND

01:39:53.987 --> 01:39:55.222
THINK ABOUT HOW TO EMPLOY. THE

01:39:55.289 --> 01:39:56.857
TYPE OF TRAINING. AND

01:39:56.924 --> 01:39:58.192
INITIATIVES THAT WE TALKED ABOUT

01:39:58.258 --> 01:39:59.960
LAST YEAR AND THAT ARE NOW UNDER

01:40:00.027 --> 01:40:05.766
WAY AS. WE THINK ABOUT CHANGES

01:40:05.833 --> 01:40:07.401
TO THE PROGRAM. ON THE OTHER

01:40:07.468 --> 01:40:08.502
QUESTION I WOULD ASK TO ADDRESS

01:40:08.569 --> 01:40:11.438
IS- RELATED TO THE HI- AND I

01:40:11.505 --> 01:40:12.773
KNOW- THE- RECORD. TALK TO

01:40:12.840 --> 01:40:14.141
BENEFIT AND WHY WILL BE THE

01:40:14.208 --> 01:40:16.377
RESULT OF THAT ELIGIBLE HOPPER.

01:40:16.443 --> 01:40:20.047
KIND OF IT KIND THE PAST. WE DO

01:40:20.114 --> 01:40:21.548
ON. HOW THESE MINUTES.

01:40:21.615 --> 01:40:23.584
TECHNICALLY CALCULATED THE

01:40:23.650 --> 01:40:24.385
AMOUNT OF THE COPPER THE HOME

01:40:24.451 --> 01:40:27.888
SIXTEEN DOLLAR- ABOUT NINE. OF

01:40:27.955 --> 01:40:29.957
OUR- CURRENT ELIGIBILITY

01:40:30.023 --> 01:40:32.292
OPERATIONS BUDGET. THAT PROPOSED

01:40:32.359 --> 01:40:35.295
CUT IS SO SIGNIFICANT AT THE

01:40:35.362 --> 01:40:36.630
SAME TIME THAT WE'RE SEEING AN

01:40:36.697 --> 01:40:38.565
INCREASE IN CASES. IT JUST

01:40:38.632 --> 01:40:40.167
DOESN'T MAKE SENSE FROM A POLICY

01:40:40.234 --> 01:40:42.169
PERSPECTIVE AND WE DON'T THINK

01:40:42.236 --> 01:40:43.704
IT'S CONSISTENT WITH THE INTENT.

01:40:43.771 --> 01:40:45.139
OF THE METHODOLOGY THAT WE RATE

01:40:45.205 --> 01:40:46.774
WE DID JUST A COUPLE OF YEARS

01:40:46.840 --> 01:40:48.909
AGO WHAT THE STATE WAS TOTALLY

01:40:48.976 --> 01:40:50.844
EITHER NARROW THE SWINGS.

01:40:50.911 --> 01:40:52.579
BETWEEN UP TURNS AND DOWNTURNS

01:40:52.646 --> 01:40:55.449
AND IN CASELOADS AND THE ECONOMY

01:40:55.516 --> 01:40:57.184
WHAT WE WERE SAYING IS THAT

01:40:57.251 --> 01:40:58.852
COUNTIES WERE GETTING. VERY

01:40:58.919 --> 01:41:00.554
LARGE AMOUNTS OF MONEY WHEN THE

01:41:00.621 --> 01:41:05.626
ECONOMY WAS GOING DOWN AND.

01:41:05.692 --> 01:41:06.860
CASELOADS WERE- WE'RE GOING- BUT

01:41:06.927 --> 01:41:09.530
STILL WE WERE CAN THAT ON SO THE

01:41:09.596 --> 01:41:11.732
IDEA WAS TO OF NAY THAT KIND OF-

01:41:11.799 --> 01:41:12.966
YOU KNOW KIND OF MINIMIZE THE

01:41:13.033 --> 01:41:14.768
SWINGS AND UNFORTUNATELY WE

01:41:14.835 --> 01:41:17.471
THINK AND NINE PERCENT. CUT OF

01:41:17.538 --> 01:41:18.605
THAT MAGNITUDE AND WHAT IT TAKES

01:41:18.672 --> 01:41:20.507
OF THIS GOING UP IS JUST-

01:41:20.574 --> 01:41:21.675
CERTAINLY NOT MINIMIZING THE

01:41:21.742 --> 01:41:24.678
SWING I GUESS I'D SAY- THE

01:41:24.745 --> 01:41:26.380
EFFECTS OF SUCH A CUT IS THAT

01:41:26.447 --> 01:41:28.182
COUNTY. HOW TO KEEP THE DOOR

01:41:28.248 --> 01:41:29.950
OPEN YEAH WE HAVE TO CONTINUE

01:41:30.017 --> 01:41:32.019
EXTRA ACCEPT AND PROCESS

01:41:32.085 --> 01:41:33.821
APPLICATIONS THAT'S EXTREMELY

01:41:33.887 --> 01:41:35.989
CRITICAL AND AS YOU HEARD WHEN

01:41:36.056 --> 01:41:37.624
THAT BREAKS DOWN AND PEOPLE

01:41:37.691 --> 01:41:39.226
DON'T GET THEIR BENEFITS. IT

01:41:39.293 --> 01:41:41.762
LEADS TO MORE HUNGER MORE

01:41:41.829 --> 01:41:44.932
HOMELESSNESS AND JUST GREATER

01:41:44.998 --> 01:41:47.501
POVERTY AND GREATER INEQUALITY-

01:41:47.568 --> 01:41:48.936
OUR CONCERN IS THAT THE BUDGET

01:41:49.002 --> 01:41:50.838
INCLUDED A LOT OF NEW RESOURCES

01:41:50.904 --> 01:41:52.873
FOR INCREASED CASE MANAGEMENT.

01:41:52.940 --> 01:41:54.274
FOR FAMILIES WHO HAVE MORE

01:41:54.341 --> 01:41:56.410
COMPLEX SITUATIONS AND TO HELP

01:41:56.477 --> 01:41:58.245
US REALLY START TO MOVE TOWARD

01:41:58.312 --> 01:41:59.146
THE CAL WORKS TWO POINT OH

01:41:59.213 --> 01:42:01.448
PRINCIPLES THE FEW WTA HOPE TO

01:42:01.515 --> 01:42:04.551
DEVELOP AND CHAMPION- OUR

01:42:04.618 --> 01:42:06.119
CONCERN IS THAT THOSE FUNDS ARE

01:42:06.186 --> 01:42:07.488
GOING TO HAVE TO BE SHIFTED.

01:42:07.554 --> 01:42:08.856
AWAY FROM EMPLOYMENT SERVICES

01:42:08.922 --> 01:42:10.224
AND FOR ITS ELIGIBILITY

01:42:10.290 --> 01:42:12.526
OPERATIONS EVEN OVER THE LAST

01:42:12.593 --> 01:42:13.660
YEAR COUNTY OVERSPEND OUR

01:42:13.727 --> 01:42:15.729
ELIGIBILITY BUDGET BY ABOUT

01:42:15.796 --> 01:42:17.464
EIGHTEEN MILLION DOLLARS I THINK

01:42:17.531 --> 01:42:19.700
IT WAS ABOUT A 103% OF THAT

01:42:19.766 --> 01:42:22.369
AMOUNT SO 3% OR ABOUT EIGHTEEN.

01:42:22.436 --> 01:42:23.637
MILLION DOLLARS AND WE SHIFTED

01:42:23.704 --> 01:42:25.606
THAT PROBLEM EITHER CHILD CARE

01:42:25.672 --> 01:42:27.207
OR EMPLOYMENT SERVICES DEPENDING

01:42:27.274 --> 01:42:29.109
ON THE COUNTY. NOW THE CHILD

01:42:29.176 --> 01:42:30.878
CARE IS NO LONGER IN THAT SINGLE

01:42:30.944 --> 01:42:32.546
APPLICATION AND TO WHERE THAT

01:42:32.613 --> 01:42:34.181
MONEY'S GOING TO COME FROM THE

01:42:34.248 --> 01:42:35.315
FROM PLANET SERVICES AND THAT'S

01:42:35.382 --> 01:42:36.350
NOT WHAT THE LEGISLATURE

01:42:36.416 --> 01:42:37.818
INTENDED. WHEN YOU PUT THAT

01:42:37.885 --> 01:42:39.586
MONEY AND IT'S NOT WHAT THE

01:42:39.653 --> 01:42:40.787
ADMINISTRATION INTENDED LAST

01:42:40.854 --> 01:42:42.823
YEAR WITH THAT BUDGET WITH FINE

01:42:42.890 --> 01:42:43.657
AND IT'S CERTAINLY NOT WHAT WE

01:42:43.724 --> 01:42:45.492
WANT TO DO WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO

01:42:45.559 --> 01:42:46.527
PROVIDE THE SERVICES. AND

01:42:46.593 --> 01:42:48.428
PROVIDE THAT EXCELLENT SERVICE

01:42:48.495 --> 01:42:50.831
BUT- IF WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE

01:42:50.898 --> 01:42:52.566
THAT PEOPLE CAN BE FOUND

01:42:52.633 --> 01:42:53.600
ELIGIBLE IF THEY NEED THESE

01:42:53.667 --> 01:42:55.402
BENEFITS THAT'S WHAT COUNTIES

01:42:55.469 --> 01:42:57.070
ARE GOING TO HAVE TO DO. AND IT

01:42:57.137 --> 01:42:59.806
JUST- IT JUST MAKES THE WHOLE

01:42:59.873 --> 01:43:02.276
PROGRAM OPERATE LESS EFFECTIVELY

01:43:02.342 --> 01:43:11.618
IF WE'RE SHIFTING FUNDS. AROUND

01:43:11.685 --> 01:43:12.219
WE THINK THE FUNDING SHOULD BE

01:43:12.286 --> 01:43:14.922
AFTER AND- STEP THAT BEAT THAT.

01:43:14.988 --> 01:43:16.089
HAPPY TO HEAR ANY. THANK YOU

01:43:16.156 --> 01:43:17.324
MUCH WITH I WILL BRING IT BACK

01:43:17.391 --> 01:43:19.293
UP TO THE DRIVE TO SEE IF ANY

01:43:19.359 --> 01:43:20.727
MEMBER OF. SEEN NINE. KEEP IT

01:43:20.794 --> 01:43:23.063
HERE AT THE- I WILL BY ECHOING

01:43:23.130 --> 01:43:24.932
WHAT JENNA GRATZ SAID ABOUT THE

01:43:24.998 --> 01:43:28.402
NEED FOR US TO OUR ARMS AROUND

01:43:28.468 --> 01:43:30.470
THE PARENTS WHO ARE. BEING BRAVE

01:43:30.537 --> 01:43:33.140
ENOUGH AND SECURE ENOUGH TO ASK

01:43:33.206 --> 01:43:34.908
FOR HELP. INSTEAD OF FORCING

01:43:34.975 --> 01:43:36.944
THEM TO WAIT MONTHS ON A

01:43:37.010 --> 01:43:38.946
CENTRALIZED PHONE SYSTEM. I

01:43:39.012 --> 01:43:40.814
WOULD AGREE WITH THE CONCLUSION

01:43:40.881 --> 01:43:41.815
THAT IT WAS NOT VALERIE WHO

01:43:41.882 --> 01:43:44.084
FAILED BUT THE SYSTEM ITSELF

01:43:44.151 --> 01:43:46.219
THAT NEEDS TO BE IMPROVED. AND

01:43:46.286 --> 01:43:47.387
SO WILL LOOK TOWARDS MANY OF

01:43:47.454 --> 01:43:48.956
THESE COMPLIANCE ORIENTED

01:43:49.022 --> 01:43:52.759
SYSTEMS TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN

01:43:52.826 --> 01:43:55.395
TROUBLED BY THE FACT THAT WE

01:43:55.462 --> 01:43:58.732
DON'T HAVE CURRENT UP TO. THE

01:43:58.799 --> 01:44:01.268
DAY UP TO THE MINUTE ATA ON

01:44:01.335 --> 01:44:03.503
TAKE A BREAK. AND SO I KIND OF

01:44:03.570 --> 01:44:05.272
WANT TO DIG IN A LITTLE BIT WITH

01:44:05.339 --> 01:44:06.807
THE ADMINISTRATION IF I CAN AS I

01:44:06.873 --> 01:44:08.375
UNDERSTAND THAT THE L. E. O.

01:44:08.442 --> 01:44:10.010
CAME OUT WITH INFORMATION IN

01:44:10.077 --> 01:44:12.779
FEBRUARY OF. TWENTY ONE AND

01:44:12.846 --> 01:44:14.781
WE'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE THE-

01:44:14.848 --> 01:44:16.950
FURTHER INFORMATION UNTIL EARLY

01:44:17.017 --> 01:44:19.219
IN TWENTY TWENTY THREE THEY'RE

01:44:19.286 --> 01:44:21.688
REALLY CREATES A GAP IN DATA FOR

01:44:21.755 --> 01:44:24.958
US RIGHT. NOW AT WHAT IS AN

01:44:25.025 --> 01:44:26.927
INFLECTION POINT. WHAT WAS

01:44:26.994 --> 01:44:29.096
REFERENCE WITHIN THE AGENDA WAS

01:44:29.162 --> 01:44:31.098
THE U. Y. WHICH RELAPSED ON

01:44:31.164 --> 01:44:34.001
SEPTEMBER OF LAST YEAR WAS THAT

01:44:34.067 --> 01:44:35.869
INFLECTION POINTS THAT I'M-

01:44:35.936 --> 01:44:37.504
REALLY WANTING TO GET AN

01:44:37.571 --> 01:44:39.706
UNDERSTANDING OF HOW WE CAN.

01:44:39.773 --> 01:44:41.375
MAKE SURE WE ARE COLLECTING THAT

01:44:41.441 --> 01:44:43.443
DATA GOING FORWARD SO WE CAN

01:44:43.510 --> 01:44:45.846
MAKE APPROPRIATE RESPONSES IN

01:44:45.912 --> 01:44:47.581
REAL TIME AND HOPING THAT THE

01:44:47.648 --> 01:44:49.983
ADMINISTRATION. CAN COMMENT ON

01:44:50.050 --> 01:44:52.219
THAT BECAUSE WHAT WE HEARD FROM

01:44:52.285 --> 01:44:54.454
THE ALLEY- WAS A SIGNIFICANTLY

01:44:54.521 --> 01:44:56.590
DECREASED AMOUNT OF CASES PER

01:44:56.657 --> 01:44:59.393
MONTH VERSUS WHAT WAS PREDICTED.

01:44:59.459 --> 01:45:00.160
THAT WOULD BE IMPORTANT

01:45:00.227 --> 01:45:01.695
INFORMATION FOR US AS THE

01:45:01.762 --> 01:45:03.964
LEGISLATURE TO HAVE AS WE WERE

01:45:04.031 --> 01:45:05.265
MAKING BUDGET DECISIONS THIS

01:45:05.332 --> 01:45:07.334
YEAR. AND I'M WONDERING WHY THAT

01:45:07.401 --> 01:45:10.704
INFORMATION. IS NOT MORE READILY

01:45:10.771 --> 01:45:14.107
AVAILABLE TO US. THANK YOU KAREN

01:45:14.174 --> 01:45:15.342
I CAN GET STARTED ON THE

01:45:15.409 --> 01:45:17.511
RESPONSE TO THIS QUESTION SO IN

01:45:17.577 --> 01:45:18.945
TERMS OF THE TAKE UP WITH THE L.

01:45:19.012 --> 01:45:20.514
A. ANALYSIS RELIED HEAVILY ON

01:45:20.580 --> 01:45:22.983
THE U. S. CENSUS BUREAU DATA. AT

01:45:23.050 --> 01:45:24.284
THAT IS THE DATA WERE WE ARE

01:45:24.351 --> 01:45:26.253
EXPERIENCING A SIGNIFICANT WAGON

01:45:26.319 --> 01:45:27.854
UPDATED INFORMATION DUE TO THE

01:45:27.921 --> 01:45:29.690
CALL THE NINETEEN PANDEMIC. AND

01:45:29.756 --> 01:45:31.858
THE ABILITY TO COLLECT A CENSUS

01:45:31.925 --> 01:45:34.327
LEVEL DATA. WE DO HAVE SOME

01:45:34.394 --> 01:45:36.430
DEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS AND

01:45:36.496 --> 01:45:38.131
OTHER DATA AVAILABLE TRUST THE

01:45:38.198 --> 01:45:40.567
DEPARTMENT THAT WERE- WORKING TO

01:45:40.634 --> 01:45:43.136
EXPLORE WE DO NOT HAVE A DEEP

01:45:43.203 --> 01:45:44.938
JUST YET ON WHEN WE CAN. PRODUCE

01:45:45.005 --> 01:45:46.873
THAT ANALYSIS BUT GIVEN SOME OF

01:45:46.940 --> 01:45:48.308
THE CONVERSATIONS THAT WE HAD

01:45:48.375 --> 01:45:49.910
TODAY TODAY. HAPPY TO TAKE

01:45:49.976 --> 01:45:52.512
ADDITIONAL FEEDBACK A AND OTHER

01:45:52.579 --> 01:45:53.714
CONSIDERATIONS THAT FOLKS WANT

01:45:53.780 --> 01:45:56.049
TO SEE IS THAT- ANALYSIS AT THE

01:45:56.116 --> 01:45:57.918
DATA IS AVAILABLE. I THINK THE

01:45:57.984 --> 01:46:00.454
OTHER PIECE ON A TAKE THAT TAKE

01:46:00.520 --> 01:46:02.956
UP RATE AT THE SIXTY. RATE-

01:46:03.023 --> 01:46:04.391
ENGAGEMENT WITH THE FOLKS OF

01:46:04.458 --> 01:46:06.793
CRAPPIE IS FOLKS EXPERIENCE.

01:46:06.860 --> 01:46:09.229
BENEFIT CLAPPED WELL ABOUT FOUR

01:46:09.296 --> 01:46:11.465
MILLION. CALIFORNIANS LOST THEIR

01:46:11.531 --> 01:46:13.533
EMPLOYMENT BENEFITS IN SEPTEMBER

01:46:13.600 --> 01:46:15.202
AND THERE IS A LITTLE BIT OF A

01:46:15.268 --> 01:46:22.242
TRICKLE THE FACTOR. FOR WIND.

01:46:22.309 --> 01:46:23.110
ANY TIME AND WHEN FOLKS ACTUALLY

01:46:23.176 --> 01:46:25.178
LOST CERTAIN AND BENEFITS. SO

01:46:25.245 --> 01:46:26.847
WHILE FOLKS STARTED TO ABOUT AND

01:46:26.913 --> 01:46:28.348
TO LATE. THAT MAY NOT HAVE

01:46:28.415 --> 01:46:29.816
IMPROPER SOME. SOME FAMILY INTO

01:46:29.883 --> 01:46:31.852
A- NO TWO DEPENDING ON A RECEIPT

01:46:31.918 --> 01:46:34.321
OF BENEFITS- IN SO. WE DO NOT

01:46:34.387 --> 01:46:37.557
HAVE A- ED THAT THE KEY SLOW

01:46:37.624 --> 01:46:44.664
DATA. I'M THE WHAT TURNED IN

01:46:44.731 --> 01:46:46.299
FROM WHAT TURNED FROM AN APPLE

01:46:46.366 --> 01:46:48.835
CANNOT EASE UP THE LATER MONTHS

01:46:48.902 --> 01:46:51.338
OF YEAR THE NEW ABOUT A MONTH

01:46:51.404 --> 01:46:53.907
LAG IN KEY DATE AND SO WE HOPE

01:46:53.974 --> 01:46:57.043
TO HAVE THAT I AT READY TO. YOUR

01:46:57.110 --> 01:47:01.748
SOON. IT I WOULD COST. MAKE SURE

01:47:01.815 --> 01:47:02.949
WE ARE LOOK AT THE- SCOPE WE ARE

01:47:03.016 --> 01:47:03.583
TALK ABOUT MILLION OF

01:47:03.650 --> 01:47:05.652
CALIFORNIANS WHO. LOST

01:47:05.719 --> 01:47:08.555
UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS AND WE'RE

01:47:08.622 --> 01:47:10.791
TALKING ABOUT TWO THOUSAND.

01:47:10.857 --> 01:47:13.193
PEOPLE PER MONTH TWO. NOW ARE

01:47:13.260 --> 01:47:15.395
BEING ENROLLED INTO CAL WORKS

01:47:15.462 --> 01:47:17.497
AND I'M STILL WONDERING. WHETHER

01:47:17.564 --> 01:47:19.733
OR NOT THERE'S ANOTHER METRIC WE

01:47:19.800 --> 01:47:20.634
SHOULD BE LOOKING AT RATHER

01:47:20.700 --> 01:47:24.204
THAN- US CENSUS INFORMATION

01:47:24.271 --> 01:47:25.739
WHETHER OR NOT THERE'S A STATE

01:47:25.806 --> 01:47:27.974
RUN METRIC THAT WE MAY WANT TO

01:47:28.041 --> 01:47:29.976
BE LOOKING OUT AND TRACKING AS

01:47:30.043 --> 01:47:31.945
WELL. SO THAT WE CAN HAVE THIS

01:47:32.012 --> 01:47:34.114
INFORMATION IN REAL TIME IN THE

01:47:34.181 --> 01:47:36.249
MIDST OF. THIS PANDEMIC OF THE

01:47:36.316 --> 01:47:38.084
CENTURY WOULD HAVE BEEN HELPFUL

01:47:38.151 --> 01:47:39.052
TO ENSURE THAT WE WERE

01:47:39.119 --> 01:47:41.121
MAXIMIZING AS MANY FAMILIES TO

01:47:41.188 --> 01:47:43.590
RECEIVE BENEFITS. THAT I'D I'D

01:47:43.657 --> 01:47:45.158
LIKE TO JUST FOLLOW UP AND

01:47:45.225 --> 01:47:46.927
FIGURE OUT WHAT WE CAN DO GOING

01:47:46.993 --> 01:47:49.763
FORWARD TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE

01:47:49.830 --> 01:47:50.664
THAT INFORMATION. I'D I'D LIKE

01:47:50.730 --> 01:47:52.332
TO THE TRANSITION AND I WILL

01:47:52.399 --> 01:47:54.568
PULL AND WHAT A DATA POINT FROM

01:47:54.634 --> 01:47:55.435
THE ENDING POVERTY IN

01:47:55.502 --> 01:47:58.004
CALIFORNIA. BUT WE SAW THAT.

01:47:58.071 --> 01:48:00.173
PIANOS DISPROPORTIONATELY WERE

01:48:00.240 --> 01:48:02.042
IN POVERTY COMPARED TO THE

01:48:02.108 --> 01:48:03.543
GENERAL POPULATION FOR

01:48:03.610 --> 01:48:06.413
CALIFORNIANS. THAT I'D LIKE TO

01:48:06.479 --> 01:48:08.081
GET INTO A DISCUSSION ABOUT THE

01:48:08.148 --> 01:48:10.183
USE SIZE AND THE EXCLUSION OF

01:48:10.250 --> 01:48:12.652
ARE UNDOCUMENTED. POPULATION AS

01:48:12.719 --> 01:48:15.555
I BELIEVE THAT MAYBE. GETTING TO

01:48:15.622 --> 01:48:21.061
THAT. OF POVERTY RATE THAT WE'RE

01:48:21.127 --> 01:48:23.430
WE LEARNED FROM THE FIRST PANEL

01:48:23.496 --> 01:48:25.532
THE IMPORTANCE FOR US TO.

01:48:25.599 --> 01:48:27.734
SUPPORT OVERLOOKED POPULATIONS

01:48:27.801 --> 01:48:31.571
THAT I'D LIKE TO UNDERSTAND FROM

01:48:31.638 --> 01:48:34.507
THE- AND- WHETHER THIS IS A

01:48:34.574 --> 01:48:37.777
TOPIC OF CONVERSATION WE- CAN

01:48:37.844 --> 01:48:39.913
BEGIN TO HAVE AS I THINK IT WILL

01:48:39.980 --> 01:48:41.948
BE IMPORTANT FOR US TO ADDRESS.

01:48:42.015 --> 01:48:44.484
THE COMPLEXITIES THAT MANY OF

01:48:44.551 --> 01:48:45.552
OUR FAMILIES ARE FACING IN OUR

01:48:45.619 --> 01:48:57.664
STATE. SO IN REQUEST THE DATA ON

01:48:57.731 --> 01:49:01.701
THE IMPACT OF UNDOCUMENTED- AT

01:49:01.768 --> 01:49:03.103
THAT POINT OUT THINGS THAT ARE

01:49:03.169 --> 01:49:04.905
EXPERIENCING POVERTY I KNOW IT

01:49:04.971 --> 01:49:06.373
CAN HI I DIRECTOR JOHNSON HAD

01:49:06.439 --> 01:49:07.307
MENTIONED EARLIER IN THE

01:49:07.374 --> 01:49:09.276
PRESIDENT THAT WHILE CAO WORKS

01:49:09.342 --> 01:49:10.744
DOES HAVE THE CAPACITY TO SERVE

01:49:10.810 --> 01:49:12.746
CHILD ONLY CASES. THAT INCLUDES

01:49:12.812 --> 01:49:15.081
FAMILIES THAT HAVE MIXED STATUS

01:49:15.148 --> 01:49:18.084
WE CAN- TAKE THAT QUESTION BACK

01:49:18.151 --> 01:49:19.386
TO EXPLORE WHAT DATA WE HAVE

01:49:19.452 --> 01:49:21.922
AVAILABLE AND TO SEE IF WE CAN

01:49:21.988 --> 01:49:23.023
USE THAT TO ALSO INFORM THE

01:49:23.089 --> 01:49:24.724
ANALYSIS THAT WE MENTIONED

01:49:24.791 --> 01:49:25.825
EARLIER AROUND PROGRAM REACH.

01:49:25.892 --> 01:49:28.261
BUT I WOULD JUST EMPHASIZE AGAIN

01:49:28.328 --> 01:49:30.196
IF THE PARENTSWERE COUNTED INTO

01:49:30.263 --> 01:49:32.599
THE A YOU SIZE THEY WOULD

01:49:32.666 --> 01:49:35.235
RECEIVE A LARGER BENEFIT. THUS

SUCH AS KEEPING THAT IN MIND IT

01:59:01.234 --> 01:59:03.035
WAS ONE THE QUESTIONS I WAS

COLORADANS EXPERIENCED OUR

01:59:20.953 --> 01:59:22.722

THAT WHEN FAMILIES ARE PAYING

01:59:23.789 --> 01:59:25.124
THE CHILD BUT THEY KNOW THAT

01:59:25.191 --> 01:59:26.859
THAT MONEY IS GOING TO GO OVER

01:59:26.926 --> 01:59:27.493
TO THE OTHER FAMILY INSTEAD OF

01:59:27.560 --> 01:59:29.195
RECOUP BY GOVERNMENT- I THINK

01:59:29.262 --> 01:59:32.598
THERE'S THIS AMERICAN HERITAGE-

01:59:32.665 --> 01:59:33.199
APPRECIATION OF THE FACT THAT

01:59:33.266 --> 01:59:34.333

GET THIS MONEY AND SO. FOLKS ARE

01:59:35.701 --> 01:59:37.370
MORE INCLINED TO PAY THE CHILD

01:59:37.436 --> 01:59:39.372

01:59:49.882 --> 01:59:51.284
BUDGET THERE'S A DECREASE ON THE

01:59:51.350 --> 01:59:53.286
US RECOUP INSIDE THERE ISN'T-

01:59:53.352 --> 01:59:55.221

OF THIS MAXIMIZES FEDERAL

02:08:06.245 --> 02:08:07.479
FLEXIBILITIES THAT THE FEDERAL

02:08:07.546 --> 02:08:09.314
GOVERNMENT WOULD ALLOW US TO DO

02:08:09.381 --> 02:08:11.250
THIS WITHOUT HAVING TO REIMBURSE

02:08:11.316 --> 02:08:13.919
THEM. FOR THEIR SHARE OF- CAL

02:08:13.986 --> 02:08:17.923
WORKS RECOUP MEANT- HOWEVER IN

02:08:17.990 --> 02:08:19.391
OUR ANALYSIS OF THE PROPOSAL WE

02:08:19.458 --> 02:08:21.026
DO NOTE THAT THIS STILL

02:08:21.093 --> 02:08:23.228
MAINTAINS A DIFFERENCE AND THE

02:08:23.295 --> 02:08:25.330
PASTOR OF BROWN'S. RETWEET

02:08:25.397 --> 02:08:27.099
CURRENT AND FORMER CAL LOOKS

02:08:27.166 --> 02:08:29.501
FAMILIES SPECIFICALLY THE STATE

02:08:29.568 --> 02:08:31.703
THE GOVERNMENT WOULD STILL BE

02:08:31.770 --> 02:08:33.472
EIGHT WOULD STILL BE RETAINING A

02:08:33.539 --> 02:08:34.940
PERSON AT A PORTION OF COUNT OF

02:08:35.007 --> 02:08:37.443
CHILD SUPPORT PAYMENTS MADE FOR

02:08:37.509 --> 02:08:38.877
CURRENT POWER XPM LEASE TO

02:08:38.944 --> 02:08:42.014
REIMBURSE ITSELF BACK FOR

02:08:42.081 --> 02:08:44.083
CALVERT'S CASH AID. OVERALL WE

02:08:44.149 --> 02:08:45.050
BELIEVE THAT THE PASSED THROUGH

02:08:45.117 --> 02:08:46.585
FRAMEWORK THAT THE LEGISLATURE

02:08:46.652 --> 02:08:48.087
ULTIMATELY DECIDES TO ADOPTION

02:08:48.153 --> 02:08:49.288
REALLY REFLECTS THAT IT'S

02:08:49.354 --> 02:08:52.191
PROGRAM GOALS. I'M FOR EXAMPLE

02:08:52.257 --> 02:08:53.659
OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE

02:08:53.725 --> 02:08:55.260
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL IS THAT THE

02:08:55.327 --> 02:08:57.162
INTENT IS TO STABILIZE THE

02:08:57.229 --> 02:08:59.932
FINANCIAL POSITION OF LOW INCOME

02:08:59.998 --> 02:09:02.634
FAMILIES- BUT SPECIFICALLY IT'S

02:09:02.701 --> 02:09:04.603
ONLY LIMITED TO FORMER CAT WORKS

02:09:04.670 --> 02:09:05.938
FAMILIES BUT WHAT WE KNOW IS

02:09:06.004 --> 02:09:07.539
THAT CURRENT COVERAGE FAMILIES.

02:09:07.606 --> 02:09:10.943
ALSO EXPERIENCE- ALSO HAVE

02:09:11.009 --> 02:09:13.345
REPORTED INCOME OUTLOOK HAVE

02:09:13.412 --> 02:09:14.880
ALSO HAVE REPORTED INCOME LEVELS

02:09:14.947 --> 02:09:17.382
THAT ARE VERY VERY WELL SO TO

02:09:17.449 --> 02:09:18.784
THE EXTENT THAT THE LEGISLATURE

02:09:18.851 --> 02:09:20.586
WANTED TO MINIMIZE THE PAST YOUR

02:09:20.652 --> 02:09:21.720
DIFFERENCES BETWEEN CURRENT AND

02:09:21.787 --> 02:09:23.722
FORMER CAL WORKS FAMILIES. AND

02:09:23.789 --> 02:09:25.124
MAXIMIZE THE NUMBER OF LOW

02:09:25.190 --> 02:09:26.692
INCOME CHILDREN AND FAMILIES

02:09:26.758 --> 02:09:27.593
THAT ARE RECEIVING ADDITIONAL

02:09:27.659 --> 02:09:29.261
PAYMENTS. IT COULD CONSIDER

02:09:29.328 --> 02:09:30.829
PROVIDING A FULL PASSED HROUGH

02:09:30.896 --> 02:09:34.166
FOR BOTH FORMER AND CURRENT

02:09:34.233 --> 02:09:35.734
COLLEAGUES FAMILIES. OVERALL THE

02:09:35.801 --> 02:09:37.136
THINGS THAT THE LEGISLATURE WE

02:09:37.202 --> 02:09:38.637
NEED TO CONSIDER WHEN I'M

02:09:38.704 --> 02:09:40.005
THINKING ABOUT WHAT PASSED

02:09:40.072 --> 02:09:41.840
THROUGH REMARK- IT WOULD WANT TO

02:09:41.907 --> 02:09:43.809
ADOPT INCLUDE PROPERLY TO EACH

02:09:43.876 --> 02:09:45.911
CHANGE BE IMPLEMENTED AS AS WAS

02:09:45.978 --> 02:09:48.013
REFERENCE BY THE ADMINISTRATION.

02:09:48.080 --> 02:09:49.748
ANY PASTOR CHANGES FOR CURRENT

02:09:49.815 --> 02:09:51.750
CAO WORKS FAMILIES LIKELY COULD

02:09:51.817 --> 02:09:53.185
NOT BE IMPLEMENTED UNTIL

02:09:53.252 --> 02:09:55.120
SOMETIME IN TWENTY FOUR TWENTY

02:09:55.187 --> 02:09:57.289
FIVE JUST DUE TO ACT YOU

02:09:57.356 --> 02:09:59.391
AUTOMATION CHALLENGES. ANOTHER

02:09:59.458 --> 02:10:00.559
THING THAT THE LEGISLATURE WOULD

02:10:00.626 --> 02:10:02.294
WANT TO CONSIDER THOUGH IS

02:10:02.361 --> 02:10:04.096
WHETHER ANY AUTOMATION PLANNING

02:10:04.163 --> 02:10:06.932
ACTIVITIES COULD BEGIN NOW- IN

02:10:06.999 --> 02:10:08.600
ORDER TO BETTER ENSURE THE

02:10:08.667 --> 02:10:10.869
EARLIEST IMPLEMENTATION DATE. OF

02:10:10.936 --> 02:10:12.838
ANY PASTOR CHANGES IT WOULD WANT

02:10:12.905 --> 02:10:14.473
TO ADOPT A CART CAL WORKS

02:10:14.540 --> 02:10:16.175
FAMILIES. AND OF COURSE

02:10:16.241 --> 02:10:18.210
ADDITIONAL COST TO THE EXTENT

02:10:18.277 --> 02:10:20.345
THAT THE LEGISLATURE DOES DECIDE

02:10:20.412 --> 02:10:22.814
TO SUPPLEMENT OR ADD ON I'M TO

02:10:22.881 --> 02:10:24.516
THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO DO A

02:10:24.583 --> 02:10:27.619
FULL PASSED THROUGH. FOR FORMER

02:10:27.686 --> 02:10:30.622
CAL WORKS FAMILIES. LASTLY WE DO

02:10:30.689 --> 02:10:33.158
NOTE THAT- IN INCREASING THE

02:10:33.225 --> 02:10:34.293
PASTOR AMOUNTS FOR CURRENT AND

02:10:34.359 --> 02:10:35.394
FORMER CAL WORKS FAMILIES THE

02:10:35.460 --> 02:10:37.329
LEGISLATURE MAY ALSO WANT TO

02:10:37.396 --> 02:10:38.397
THINK ABOUT WHETHER THAT WOULD

02:10:38.463 --> 02:10:39.831
HAVE ANY IMPACT ON PROGRAM

02:10:39.898 --> 02:10:41.900
ELIGIBILITY. FOR THAT FAMILY

02:10:41.967 --> 02:10:44.236
WHEN IT COMES TO. OTHER SOCIAL

02:10:44.303 --> 02:10:46.605
SERVICES PROGRAMS AND HOW WOULD

02:10:46.672 --> 02:10:48.840
WANT TO DEAL WITH THAT. THE

02:10:48.907 --> 02:10:50.909
SECOND A BUDGET PROPOSAL THAT'S

02:10:50.976 --> 02:10:53.478
LAID OUT IN THE AGENDA- REFERS

02:10:53.545 --> 02:10:55.714
TO A REQUEST FOR ADDITIONAL

02:10:55.781 --> 02:10:57.216
ADMINISTRATIVE FUNDING FOR LOCAL

02:10:57.282 --> 02:11:00.385
CHILD SUPPORT AGENCIES- THIS

02:11:00.452 --> 02:11:02.554
ESSENTIALLY IT BUILDS UPON A MAP

02:11:02.621 --> 02:11:04.122
AT ALL A FUNDING METHODOLOGY

02:11:04.189 --> 02:11:06.558
THAT WAS CONSTRUCTED BACK IN

02:11:06.625 --> 02:11:07.559
TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY. WE

02:11:07.626 --> 02:11:09.361
CONTINUE TO HAVE CONCERNS WITH

02:11:09.428 --> 02:11:11.563
THE L. C. SA FUNDING METHODOLOGY

02:11:11.630 --> 02:11:13.765
AND THAT IT DOES NOT INCENTIVIZE

02:11:13.832 --> 02:11:14.733
THE ADOPTION OF PROGRAM

02:11:14.800 --> 02:11:17.469
EFFICIENCIES- THAT COULD ALSO

02:11:17.536 --> 02:11:19.271
HAVE THE EFFECT OF REDUCING COST

02:11:19.338 --> 02:11:20.872
PRESSURES AND FREE OF EXISTING

02:11:20.939 --> 02:11:23.041
FUNDS- BUT ALSO WHAT WE ARE

02:11:23.108 --> 02:11:24.610
CONCERNED THAT THE LCC FUNDING

02:11:24.676 --> 02:11:27.012
METHODOLOGY. DOES NOT REFLECT

02:11:27.079 --> 02:11:29.748
ACTUAL FUNDING NEEDS I'M GIVEN

02:11:29.815 --> 02:11:32.684
THAT IT IS BASED OFF OF TWENTY

02:11:32.751 --> 02:11:34.286
EIGHTEEN OPERATION LEVELS.

02:11:34.353 --> 02:11:36.488
HOWEVER SINCE THEN SO MUCH HAS

02:11:36.555 --> 02:11:37.823
CHANGED BUT THE PROGRAM

02:11:37.889 --> 02:11:39.458
OPERATIONS IN LIGHT OF COVIC BUT

02:11:39.524 --> 02:11:42.761
ALSO- WE ANTICIPATE EVEN FUTURE

02:11:42.828 --> 02:11:44.863
CHANGES TO OPERATIONS LEVELS AS

02:11:44.930 --> 02:11:46.265
WE SEEK TO COMPLY WITH THE

02:11:46.331 --> 02:11:47.399
RECENT FEDERAL WORK

02:11:47.466 --> 02:11:49.067
REQUIREMENTS- BASED OFF OF THE

02:11:49.134 --> 02:11:50.502
TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE THAT THE

02:11:50.569 --> 02:11:52.437
ADMINISTRATION INTRODUCED. SO

02:11:52.504 --> 02:11:53.639
WITH THAT SAID WE RECOMMEND THAT

02:11:53.705 --> 02:11:55.374
THE LEGISLATURE NOT PROVIDING

02:11:55.440 --> 02:11:58.810
YOU FUTURE- FUNDING INCREASES

02:11:58.877 --> 02:12:00.178
UNTIL THE ADMINISTRATION. SAYS

02:12:00.245 --> 02:12:02.047
IT'S FUNDING METHODOLOGY TO

02:12:02.114 --> 02:12:03.081
ADDRESS THOSE IDENTIFIED

02:12:03.148 --> 02:12:05.183
SHORTCOMINGS SOME OF THE CHANGES

02:12:05.250 --> 02:12:06.251
ARE PRETTY STRAIGHTFORWARD AND

02:12:06.318 --> 02:12:08.053
COULD BE ADDED TO THE FUNDING

02:12:08.120 --> 02:12:10.455
METHODOLOGY RELATIVELY QUICKLY.

02:12:10.522 --> 02:12:12.057
LIKE LIMITING THE COST OF DOING

02:12:12.124 --> 02:12:14.726
BUSINESS ADJUSTMENTS- TO A FIXED

02:12:14.793 --> 02:12:16.928
RATE DOOR ADDING AN ON GOING

02:12:16.995 --> 02:12:18.830
PROCESS IN WHICH BUDGETS FOR

02:12:18.897 --> 02:12:20.432
OVER FUNDED L. CSAS. ARE

02:12:20.499 --> 02:12:22.734
INCREMENTALLY REDUCED OVER A

02:12:22.801 --> 02:12:24.703
CERTAIN PERIOD OF TIME AND THEN

02:12:24.770 --> 02:12:26.038
THOSE EXCESS FUNDS ARE

02:12:26.104 --> 02:12:27.639
REDISTRIBUTED. TO UNDERFUNDED

02:12:27.706 --> 02:12:29.608
ALSO USING. OTHER POSSIBLE

02:12:29.675 --> 02:12:31.310
CHANGES INCLUDE USING ANY

02:12:31.376 --> 02:12:33.278
ADDITIONAL FUTURE FUNDING TO

02:12:33.345 --> 02:12:34.913
SUPPORT STAFFING MODELS ARE

02:12:34.980 --> 02:12:37.015
SERVICE MODELS THAT SPECIFICALLY

02:12:37.082 --> 02:12:42.454
ALIGNED. WITH LEGISLATIVE

02:12:42.521 --> 02:12:43.622
PROGRAM GOALS. THE LAST

02:12:43.689 --> 02:12:45.324
PROPOSALS IN AT PROPOSAL THE

TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE TO. I'M TO

LANGUAGE BUT TWO THINGS THAT I

02:12:54.566 --> 02:12:56.268

02:12:56.335 --> 02:12:56.935
THINGS THAT WERE CONSIDERING

02:12:57.002 --> 02:12:59.237
INCLUDE. ONE WHETHER IT MAKES

02:12:59.304 --> 02:13:01.039
SENSE FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO

02:13:01.106 --> 02:13:03.108
ADOPT MORE DETAILED LANGUAGE AND

02:13:03.175 --> 02:13:05.210
DEFINITIONS AROUND ANY NEW

02:13:05.277 --> 02:13:07.079

THE ALL FIRST TWENTY YEARS THE

02:18:12.250 --> 02:18:14.219

02:18:48.319 --> 02:18:50.355
RATED IS SHOWING REMARKABLE

02:18:50.422 --> 02:18:55.260
RESULTS. AND ENSURE. PRETTY

02:18:55.326 --> 02:18:58.697
SIMPLE- WHEN NON CRYPTO PARENTS

02:18:58.763 --> 02:19:00.331
. NO THAT THE MONEY IS GOING TO

02:19:00.398 --> 02:19:02.634
THE RICH. AND NOT TO THE

02:19:02.701 --> 02:19:06.271
GOVERNMENT. THE PARENTS PAY MORE

02:19:06.337 --> 02:19:10.442
AND THEY PAY MORE OFTEN. SO WE

02:19:10.508 --> 02:19:11.643
IN COLORADO WE'VE SEEN

02:19:11.710 --> 02:19:13.712
SIGNIFICANT INCREASES BUT

02:19:13.778 --> 02:19:16.014
BELIEVE ONE STUDY CITED THAT

02:19:16.081 --> 02:19:18.383
THERE WAS 76% INCREASE IN THE

02:19:18.450 --> 02:19:20.051
NUMBER OF PARENTS WHO PAY AND

02:19:20.118 --> 02:19:21.419
ABOUT A HUNDRED AND OF THOSE WHO

02:19:21.486 --> 02:19:23.388
PAID THE FAMILY GOT OUT A

02:19:23.455 --> 02:19:25.390
HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SIX DOLLARS

02:19:25.457 --> 02:19:26.958
MORE A MONTH IN INCOME. THAT'S A

02:19:27.025 --> 02:19:29.427
LOT OF MONEY FOR A VERY VERY LOW

02:19:29.494 --> 02:19:31.096
INCOME FAMILIES AND THE FAMILIES

02:19:31.162 --> 02:19:33.298
WHO ARE CURRENTLY LIVING IN DEEP

02:19:33.364 --> 02:19:35.366
POVERTY CALIFORNIA. PROGRAM'S

02:19:35.433 --> 02:19:38.636
REALLY MAKE A DIFFERENCE- AND SO

02:19:38.703 --> 02:19:41.239
WE WOULD URGE THE LEGISLATURE TO

02:19:41.306 --> 02:19:44.409
FIND A WAY TO PASS THROUGH ALL

02:19:44.476 --> 02:19:46.244
THE CHILD SUPPORT FOR THE

02:19:46.311 --> 02:19:48.646
CURRENT CASES WE ALSO WOULD

02:19:48.713 --> 02:19:52.250
ENCOURAGE. YOU TO SUPPORT THE

02:19:52.317 --> 02:19:53.985
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. IT YOU'RE

02:19:54.052 --> 02:19:55.854
UNFORTUNATE HAVE TO CHOOSE BASED

02:19:55.920 --> 02:19:57.722
ON THE BUDGET CONCERN. YOU KNOW

02:19:57.789 --> 02:20:00.692
WE WOULD PRIORITIZE THE CURRENT

02:20:00.759 --> 02:20:03.194
CASES FIRST BECAUSE WE THINK THE

02:20:03.261 --> 02:20:03.962
NEEDS OF THOSE FAMILIES ARE

02:20:04.028 --> 02:20:06.030
GREATER. BUT WE'RE REALLY HOPING

02:20:06.097 --> 02:20:09.067
THAT WE CAN BE ABLE. AND ONE

02:20:09.134 --> 02:20:11.870
LAST THING WE WOULD JUST SAY

02:20:11.936 --> 02:20:14.506
ABOUT CHILD SUPPORT. IF WE WANT

02:20:14.572 --> 02:20:16.941
NON PARENTS TO PAY WE NEED TO

02:20:17.008 --> 02:20:18.676
MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAVE THE

02:20:18.743 --> 02:20:21.479
TOOLS TO BE ABLE TO GO OUT OF

02:20:21.546 --> 02:20:23.515
WORK AND GENERATE INCOME. WE

02:20:23.581 --> 02:20:26.217
SPEND A LOT OF DRIVERS LICENSES

02:20:26.284 --> 02:20:27.786
OF NONCUSTODIAL PARENTS TO RENT

02:20:27.852 --> 02:20:29.954
ARREARS RIGHT NOW. AND MANY OF

02:20:30.021 --> 02:20:32.423
THE VAST MAJORITY OF THEM ARE

02:20:32.490 --> 02:20:34.926
POOR. SO TAKING AWAY THEIR

02:20:34.993 --> 02:20:36.227
LICENSE MEANS THEY'RE LESS

02:20:36.294 --> 02:20:37.362
LIKELY TO WORK THEY'RE MORE

02:20:37.428 --> 02:20:39.464
LIKELY TO LOSE THEIR JOBS. WE

02:20:39.531 --> 02:20:41.699
SHOULD BE VERY NARROWLY APPLYING

02:20:41.766 --> 02:20:43.735

02:20:43.802 --> 02:20:45.570

WHOSE INCOME WE KNOW. AB

02:20:48.740 --> 02:20:50.108
DEVELOPMENT THE PAYMENT WE'RE

02:20:50.175 --> 02:20:53.778
NOT MAKING. GOING AFTER LOW LOW

02:20:53.845 --> 02:20:57.215
IN- INTO. THAT'S A SPENDING BILL

02:20:57.282 --> 02:21:00.118
AND JUST MAKES WORSE. THANK YOU

02:41:09.059 --> 02:41:10.894
EVALUATE HOW MUCH OF THAT THE

02:41:10.961 --> 02:41:12.829
PAYMENTS IS PASSED TO THE FAMILY

02:41:12.896 --> 02:41:14.398
AND HW MUCH IS RETAIN OFF OF

02:41:14.464 --> 02:41:16.767
THIS NEW INCREASE THRESHOLD- AND

02:41:16.833 --> 02:41:17.634
WE HAVE SOME TIME TO DO THAT

02:41:17.701 --> 02:41:19.403
BECAUSE- THROUGH OUR ANALYSIS

02:41:19.469 --> 02:41:21.471
OF. OF SYSTEMS WE DON'T FEEL

02:41:21.538 --> 02:41:23.407
LIKE WE CAN REACH THIS OR GET TO

02:41:23.473 --> 02:41:25.242
THIS- SYSTEM CHANGE BECAUSE THIS

02:41:25.308 --> 02:41:26.576
IS A PRETTY MASSIVE ON THE

02:41:26.643 --> 02:41:27.844
CURRENT SUPPORT SYSTEMS SIDE OF

02:41:27.911 --> 02:41:29.379
THINGS AS OPPOSED TO THE- FORMER

02:41:29.446 --> 02:41:31.214
SIDE. WE DON'T THINK WE WOULD BE

02:41:31.281 --> 02:41:32.015
ABLE TO GET THOSE

02:41:32.082 --> 02:41:32.649
IMPLEMENTATIONS IN THE SYSTEMS

02:41:32.716 --> 02:41:34.317
OF TOP TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE

02:41:34.384 --> 02:41:35.886
SO I THINK THIS TOPIC OF

02:41:35.952 --> 02:41:37.521
CONVERSATION CAN CONTINUE- AND

02:41:37.587 --> 02:41:39.389
WITH MORE DATA AS WE START TO

02:41:39.456 --> 02:41:41.291
SEE THE IMPACT OF. THE INCREASE

02:41:41.358 --> 02:41:42.959
PASTOR TO ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS SO

02:41:43.026 --> 02:41:44.327
I WOULDN'T SAY THAT THERE'S

02:41:44.394 --> 02:41:47.130
NECESSARILY ANY EIGHTY. ISSUE

02:41:47.197 --> 02:41:50.133
FROM THE S. SO FROM DAY- THE

02:41:50.200 --> 02:41:51.735
GOVERNOR'S SIDE THAT THAT THIS

02:41:51.802 --> 02:41:52.969
IS THE WRONG WAY TO GO WE'RE

02:41:53.036 --> 02:41:54.938
JUST NOT SURE THAT WE CAN TACKLE

02:41:55.005 --> 02:41:56.406
THIS RIGHT NOW AND WE HAVE SOME

02:41:56.473 --> 02:41:58.775
OPPORTUNITY TO LOOK AT THAT AS

02:41:58.842 --> 02:42:00.210
WITH FOR. I WOULD APPRECIATE A

02:42:00.277 --> 02:42:01.511
CHANCE TO HAVE THOSE

02:42:01.578 --> 02:42:04.648
CONVERSATIONS TO UNDERSTAND WHAT

02:42:04.714 --> 02:42:07.017
PORTION IS STATE RECRUITMENT

02:42:07.084 --> 02:42:09.486
VERSUS FEDERAL RECRUITMENT TO

02:42:09.553 --> 02:42:16.326
GET A. BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF

02:42:16.393 --> 02:42:18.261
HOW WE I. EVENTUALLY ARE MAKING

02:42:18.328 --> 02:42:18.929
SURE WERE TAKING CARE OF. NEEDS-

02:42:18.995 --> 02:42:21.698
OVER COVER. NEEDS BUT NOW WOULD

02:42:21.765 --> 02:42:23.300
TO TRANSIT IF I COULD TO SPEAK

02:42:23.366 --> 02:42:25.669
LITTLE BIT ABOUT. AND ON TWENTY

02:42:25.735 --> 02:42:28.271
EIGHT OF THE AGENDA THERE'S A

02:42:28.338 --> 02:42:30.574

JUST A BRIEF MOMENT KNOWN AS-

02:56:06.122 --> 02:56:09.225
WAS REFERENCED BY THE QUESTIONS

02:56:09.292 --> 02:56:10.393

ADDRESS ON C. FIVE IT EXPANSION-

02:56:14.797 --> 02:56:16.732
WE DO THINK THAT THE LEGISLATURE

02:56:16.799 --> 02:56:18.901
HAS AN IMPORTANT DECISION LAID

02:56:18.968 --> 02:56:21.370

ASSISTANCE WHICH RIGHT NOW

02:56:26.776 --> 02:56:30.913
SERVES A VERY NARROW- POPULATION

02:56:30.980 --> 02:56:32.581

FROM THE PROGRAM. THE

02:56:40.656 --> 02:56:41.857
LEGISLATURE HAS EXPRESSED A

02:56:41.924 --> 02:56:44.126
DESIRE TO EVENTUALLY EXPAND

02:56:44.193 --> 02:56:45.728
THOSE FOOD BENEFITS THE TOTAL

02:56:45.795 --> 02:56:47.863
POPULATION THAT IS CURRENTLY IN

02:56:47.930 --> 02:56:50.499
ELIGIBLE FOR. FOOD ASSISTANCE DO

THOUSAND WITH SEVEN- FOLKS USING

02:57:01.877 --> 02:57:04.046
AN AGE BASED APPROACH BUT DID

NOT SPECIFY WHICH AGE RANGES

02:57:06.682 --> 02:57:08.184
WOULD BENEFIT FIRST NOT THE

02:57:08.250 --> 02:57:10.286
ADMINISTRATION HAS PROPOSED WE

02:57:10.353 --> 02:57:12.154
START WITH AGES FIFTY FIVE AND

02:57:12.221 --> 02:57:13.689
OLDER AND THEY'VE GIVEN YOU SOME

02:57:13.756 --> 02:57:16.792
ARGUMENTS FOR WHY. BUT THERE ARE

02:57:16.859 --> 02:57:19.662
OTHER POPULATIONS ARE NEEDING-

02:57:19.729 --> 02:57:21.797
WE THINK LOOKING AT THE DATA OUT

02:57:21.864 --> 02:57:23.466
THERE ARE OTHER POPULATIONS THAT

02:57:23.532 --> 02:57:25.901
ARE BOTH LARGER AMONGST THE

02:57:25.968 --> 02:57:28.337
UNDOCUMENTED POPULATION IN

02:57:28.404 --> 02:57:29.839
CALIFORNIA AND MORE LIKELY TO

BE. INCOME ELIGIBLE FOR THIS

02:57:31.640 --> 02:57:34.043
PROGRAM AND THESE ARE JUST

02:57:34.110 --> 02:57:35.978
FACTORS THAT THE LEGISLATURE

02:57:36.045 --> 02:57:37.947
SHOULD KEEP IN MIND IN DECIDING

02:57:38.014 --> 02:57:41.851
HOW EXACTLY THIS THIS ROLLOUTS

02:57:41.917 --> 02:57:42.451

HAVE TO ADDRESS- TALK ABOUT

02:58:00.903 --> 02:58:02.505
COUNTIES EXPERIENCE WITH

CALFRESH AND WHAT'S BEEN GOING

02:58:04.340 --> 02:58:06.108
ON DURING THE PANDEMIC WHAT WE

02:58:06.175 --> 02:58:07.309
NEED TO SUCCESSFULLY CONDUCT THE

02:58:07.376 --> 02:58:09.545
WORK AND SOME OF THE CHANGES

02:58:09.612 --> 02:58:12.481
THAT MUST HERNANDEZ TALKED ABOUT

02:58:12.548 --> 02:58:14.050
AS WELL AS THE REPORT. SO FIRST

02:58:14.116 --> 02:58:15.618
OFF WHAT WE'VE SEEN DURING THE

02:58:15.684 --> 02:58:18.154
PANDEMIC IS- INCREASES AND CAN

02:58:18.220 --> 02:58:19.889
EXPLODE AND APPLICATIONS THAT

02:58:19.955 --> 02:58:21.190
HAVE BEEN LARGELY SUSTAINED

02:58:21.257 --> 02:58:22.992
THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE PANDEMIC

02:58:23.059 --> 02:58:26.128
PERIOD. CALFRESH IS. USUALLY A

02:58:26.195 --> 02:58:28.297
LEADING INDICATOR OF ECONOMIC

02:58:28.364 --> 02:58:29.632
HARDSHIP. BOB GRAHAM THAT

02:58:29.698 --> 02:58:31.500
HISTORICALLY HAS GROWN FIRST

02:58:31.567 --> 02:58:33.502
DURING AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN OR

02:58:33.569 --> 02:58:35.471
RECESSION WITH THE PANDEMIC

02:58:35.538 --> 02:58:37.807
HOWEVER WE THOUGHT- IN ADDITION

02:58:37.873 --> 02:58:39.275
TO THAT INITIAL INCREASE THE

02:58:39.341 --> 02:58:41.343
SAME KINDS OF BUMPS THAT I HAD

02:58:41.410 --> 02:58:42.511
TALKED ABOUT IN THE CAL WORKS

02:58:42.578 --> 02:58:44.580
PROGRAM PANEL. HOWEVER THE

02:58:44.647 --> 02:58:47.116
NUMBERS ARE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER

02:58:47.183 --> 02:58:48.484
AT EVERY POINT OF THE PANDEMIC

02:58:48.551 --> 02:58:50.453
THAN THE RAWNUMBERS THAT WE

02:58:50.519 --> 02:58:52.354
TALK ABOUT HOW. WE WENT FROM AN

02:58:52.421 --> 02:58:54.590
AVERAGE OF ABOUT FORTY THOUSAND

02:58:54.657 --> 02:58:56.092
APPLICATIONS FOR A WEEK BEFORE

02:58:56.158 --> 02:58:58.494
THE PANDEMIC. BUT DURING THE END

02:58:58.561 --> 02:59:00.029
OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE REACHED AN

02:59:00.096 --> 02:59:02.698
AVERAGE OF A HUNDRED THOUSAND

02:59:02.765 --> 02:59:04.200
APPLICATIONS PER WEEK FOR A

02:59:04.266 --> 02:59:06.268
SHORT PERIOD SO THAT HAS BALLOT

02:59:06.335 --> 02:59:07.770
PAPER OFF THE BAT IT STILL

02:59:07.837 --> 02:59:10.372
REMAINS HIGH AND ABOVE THE FORTY

02:59:10.439 --> 02:59:16.545
THOUSAND NUMBER MORE LIKE. SIXTY

02:59:16.612 --> 02:59:17.913
THOUSAND. I WILL HONESTLY THAT

02:59:17.980 --> 02:59:19.315
MANY COUNTIES ARE STRUGGLING AND

02:59:19.381 --> 02:59:20.883
THAT THE BUYER BUT THE SUSTAIN

02:59:20.950 --> 02:59:22.751
INCREASES HAVE REALLY

02:59:22.818 --> 02:59:24.487
EXACERBATED A SITUATION THAT

02:59:24.553 --> 02:59:26.622
WE'VE BEEN FACING FOR YEARS NOW

02:59:26.689 --> 02:59:28.557
IN WHICH COUNTIES ARE SEVERELY

02:59:28.624 --> 02:59:30.059
UNDERFUNDED FOR THE WORK THAT WE

02:59:30.126 --> 02:59:33.028
DO COULD MINISTER CAL CALFRESH

02:59:33.095 --> 02:59:34.597
ON BEHALF OF THE STATE AND

02:59:34.663 --> 02:59:36.332
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. WE'VE NOT

02:59:36.398 --> 02:59:37.867
RECEIVED A COST OF DOING

02:59:37.933 --> 02:59:39.435
BUSINESS INCREASE FOR CALFRESH

02:59:39.502 --> 02:59:41.737
SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND ONE SO

02:59:41.804 --> 02:59:42.938
THIS MEANS WERE BEING FUNDED AS

02:59:43.005 --> 02:59:45.875
A WORKER SALARIES BENEFIT COSTS

02:59:45.941 --> 02:59:47.543
THE COST OF OFFICE SPACE IN

02:59:47.610 --> 02:59:49.678
OFFICE SUPPLIES EVERYTHING THAT

02:59:49.745 --> 02:59:51.614
WE NEED TO GO INTO OPERATING

02:59:51.680 --> 02:59:54.316
THAT OFFICE AND STAFFING AT-

02:59:54.383 --> 02:59:58.087
IT'S STILL THE SAME COST AS OF

02:59:58.154 --> 02:59:59.121
ONE TWENTY ONE YEARS AGO. THAT

02:59:59.188 --> 03:00:00.689
IF THE STATE HAD PER. IN THE

03:00:00.756 --> 03:00:02.358
WILL AND PLAY AND JOB TO ITS

03:00:02.424 --> 03:00:04.493
SHARE OF CALFRESH ADMINISTRATION

03:00:04.560 --> 03:00:06.562
COSTS DURING THIS TIME. STATE

03:00:06.629 --> 03:00:07.796
GENERAL FUND THE COUNTIES WOULD

03:00:07.863 --> 03:00:10.499
BE HIGHER BY ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED

03:00:10.566 --> 03:00:12.001
AND FOURTEEN MILLION DOLLARS.

03:00:12.067 --> 03:00:13.536
AND THAT DOESN'T INCLUDE

03:00:13.602 --> 03:00:15.104
STATUTORY FEDERAL AND COUNTY

03:00:15.171 --> 03:00:17.206
MATCHING FUNDS THE TOTAL AMOUNT

03:00:17.273 --> 03:00:18.340
WHEN YOU TAKE THOSE INTO ACCOUNT

03:00:18.407 --> 03:00:20.876
AS WELL AS ABOUT ONE POINT TWO

03:00:20.943 --> 03:00:23.445
BILLION DOLLARS. HIGHER AT THAT

03:00:23.512 --> 03:00:25.314
THE PROGRAM WOULD BE FUNDED THAN

03:00:25.381 --> 03:00:27.716
IT IS TODAY. THAT THE QUAKE TO

03:00:27.783 --> 03:00:29.818
ABOUT SIXTY FOUR HUNDRED WORKERS

03:00:29.885 --> 03:00:32.054
MORE THAN SIX THOUSAND WORKERS

03:00:32.121 --> 03:00:33.856
THAT WE WOULD HAVE ON THE JOB ON

03:00:33.923 --> 03:00:35.391
THOSE FRONT LINES. THAT WE'VE

03:00:35.457 --> 03:00:38.794
BEEN UNABLE TO HIGHER BECAUSE OF

03:00:38.861 --> 03:00:39.795
THE LACK OF THE SPOT. THERE'S A

03:00:39.862 --> 03:00:41.697
COUPLE THINGS THAT HAPPEN WHEN

03:00:41.764 --> 03:00:43.599
WE'RE UNDER FIVE. THE TWO MAIN

03:00:43.666 --> 03:00:44.800
THINGS YOU THINK ABOUT WITH

03:00:44.867 --> 03:00:47.236
CALFRESH OUR TIMELINESS AND

03:00:47.303 --> 03:00:49.371
ACCURACY YOU WANT PEOPLE WHO ARE

03:00:49.438 --> 03:00:51.073
HUNGRY TO GET THEIR BENEFITS AS

03:00:51.140 --> 03:00:52.708
QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE YEAH WHEN

03:00:52.775 --> 03:00:55.144
SOMEONE IS ELIGIBLE YOU WANT TO

03:00:55.211 --> 03:00:57.046
FIND THEM ELIGIBLE IF THEY'RE

03:00:57.112 --> 03:00:59.048
NOT ELIGIBLE WE SHOULD FIND THEM

03:00:59.114 --> 03:01:01.183
NOT ELIGIBLE YEAH WE ALSO NEED

03:01:01.250 --> 03:01:02.351
TO CALCULATE THE APPROPRIATE

03:01:02.418 --> 03:01:04.653
BENEFIT AMOUNT. FOR THAT

03:01:04.720 --> 03:01:06.021
INDIVIDUAL OR FAMILY. IN

03:01:06.088 --> 03:01:08.691
ADDITION SHIHO- THE CALCULATION

03:01:08.757 --> 03:01:10.426
COUNTIES HAVE GENERALLY THIRTY

03:01:10.492 --> 03:01:11.894
DAYS TO PROFIT A CALFRESH

03:01:11.961 --> 03:01:13.829
APPLICATION BUT SOMEONE WHO

03:01:13.896 --> 03:01:15.898
COMES IN AND HAS A CERTAIN. OF

03:01:15.965 --> 03:01:17.866
REQUIREMENTS THAT SUCH AS A VERY

03:01:17.933 --> 03:01:19.768
LOW AMOUNT OF MONEY IN THE BANK

03:01:19.835 --> 03:01:21.737
HAVE THERE IS AN IMMEDIATE NEED

03:01:21.804 --> 03:01:23.205
REQUIREMENT WE ARE SUPPOSED TO

03:01:23.272 --> 03:01:26.008
PROCESS THOSE WITHIN THREE DAYS.

03:01:26.075 --> 03:01:27.676
AND COUNTY STRUGGLED WITH THAT'S

03:01:27.743 --> 03:01:29.211
QUITE FRANKLY AND IT'S LARGELY

03:01:29.278 --> 03:01:30.746
BECAUSE OF THE VOLUME THAT WE'RE

03:01:30.813 --> 03:01:32.581
EXPERIENCING AND THE LACK OF

03:01:32.648 --> 03:01:35.117
STAFFING. ACCURACY IS REALLY

03:01:35.184 --> 03:01:37.186
CRITICAL AS WELL- THERE ARE

03:01:37.253 --> 03:01:39.822
FEDERAL REVIEWS OF OUR ACCURACY

03:01:39.888 --> 03:01:41.123
BOTH THAT ELIGIBILITY

03:01:41.190 --> 03:01:43.025
DETERMINATION AT TRIAL AS WELL

03:01:43.092 --> 03:01:44.593
AS THE BENEFIT AMOUNT AND

03:01:44.660 --> 03:01:45.728
GETTING THAT WRONG IN EITHER

03:01:45.794 --> 03:01:47.963
DIRECTION A LOWER OR HIGHER

03:01:48.030 --> 03:01:49.265
BENEFIT. THAT SOMEONE IS A

03:01:49.331 --> 03:01:50.833
LEGIBLE FOR FINDING SOMEONE

03:01:50.899 --> 03:01:52.401
INELIGIBLE WHEN THEY'RE REALLY

03:01:52.468 --> 03:01:53.802
ELIGIBLE OR VICE VERSA CAN

03:01:53.869 --> 03:01:55.371
ULTIMATELY RESULT IN PENALTIES

03:01:55.437 --> 03:01:57.306
FOR THE STATE. THE COUNTIES ALSO

03:01:57.373 --> 03:01:58.607
SHARING THESE PENALTIES IF I

03:01:58.674 --> 03:02:00.376
COUNTY CONTRIBUTED TO THAT

03:02:00.442 --> 03:02:05.247
OVERALL. THE ISSUE THAT RESULTED

03:02:05.314 --> 03:02:06.415
IN THE PENALTY. THERE ARE A

03:02:06.482 --> 03:02:07.316
COUPLE OF OTHER THINGS AND- THAT

03:02:07.383 --> 03:02:08.484
IT COULD. TO THE R. FUNDING WE

03:02:08.550 --> 03:02:10.152
HAVE NOT ALWAYS RECEIVE FULL

03:02:10.219 --> 03:02:11.353
FUNDING FOR K. FOR INCREASED.

03:02:11.420 --> 03:02:15.758
THE AFTER FIVE I HAVE. OUT OF

03:02:15.824 --> 03:02:16.959
THE MEDICATION THAT BROUGHT IN

03:02:17.026 --> 03:02:18.327
YOU KNOW HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS

03:02:18.394 --> 03:02:20.629
OF SS I RECIPIENTS I WE WERE NOT

03:02:20.696 --> 03:02:22.264
FULLY FUNDED FOR THAT USE THAT

03:02:22.331 --> 03:02:24.199
INCREASE EVEN AT THAT TWO

03:02:24.266 --> 03:02:25.768
THOUSAND AND ONE LEVEL. AND

03:02:25.834 --> 03:02:26.435
THERE HAS BEEN RECENT

03:02:26.502 --> 03:02:28.537
LEGISLATION PASSED IN PARTICULAR

03:02:28.604 --> 03:02:30.506
A BILL THAT REQUIRES COMPANIES

03:02:30.572 --> 03:02:32.341
TO HAVE A PERSON IDENTIFIED TO

03:02:32.408 --> 03:02:34.710
WORK WITH THE COLLEGE SYSTEM. TO

03:02:34.777 --> 03:02:36.345
ENSURE THAT BENEFITS ARE MADE

03:02:36.412 --> 03:02:38.347
AVAILABLE WHICH WE TOTALLY AGREE

03:02:38.414 --> 03:02:39.782
THERE'S A FUNDING FOR THAT THE

03:02:39.848 --> 03:02:41.016
BUDGET WE'RE WORKING WITH THE

03:02:41.083 --> 03:02:42.551
ADMINISTRATION ON THAT ISSUE AND

03:02:42.618 --> 03:02:43.919
HOPE THAT THAT WILL BE ADDRESSED

03:02:43.986 --> 03:02:45.921
AND NAY. BUT TYPICALLY FOR THE

03:02:45.988 --> 03:02:47.790
ADMINISTRATION GAP WE ARE

03:02:47.856 --> 03:02:49.458
REQUESTING SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS

03:02:49.525 --> 03:02:51.593
GENERAL FUND AS A BRIDGE TO THE

03:02:51.660 --> 03:02:53.195
NEW BUDGETING METHODOLOGY THAT

03:02:53.262 --> 03:02:55.097
MUST HERNANDEZ MATCH AND- WE'RE

03:02:55.164 --> 03:02:57.099
EXPECTING THAT METHODOLOGY TO BE

03:02:57.166 --> 03:03:00.269
USED IN TWENTY. TWENTY TWENTY

03:03:00.336 --> 03:03:02.438
THREE TWENTY FOUR IF WE STAY ON

03:03:02.504 --> 03:03:03.038
TRACK SO WOULD BE SOMETHING

03:03:03.105 --> 03:03:04.106
YOU'D BE DISCUSSING NEXT YEAR

03:03:04.173 --> 03:03:06.308
WITH ALL OF US DURING THAT I

03:03:06.375 --> 03:03:08.277
JUST YES SORT OF DISCUSSION OVER

03:03:08.344 --> 03:03:09.778
BUDGET CLASS ONE. SO WE'RE

03:03:09.845 --> 03:03:11.213
HOPING THAT THAT FIFTY MILLION

03:03:11.280 --> 03:03:12.414
DOLLARS GENERAL FUND CAN BE SEEN

03:03:12.481 --> 03:03:14.249
AS A BRANCH THAT HOPEFULLY WILL

03:03:14.316 --> 03:03:16.151
ONLY LAST ONE YEAR TO US GETTING

03:03:16.218 --> 03:03:18.220
TO THAT METHODOLOGY. I WILL SAY

03:03:18.287 --> 03:03:20.356
THAT THAT- INTENDED DID ASK WHAT

03:03:20.422 --> 03:03:21.590
THEY'RE THINKING YOU KNOW KIND

03:03:21.657 --> 03:03:22.758
OF WHAT WE THINK ABOUT THAT

03:03:22.825 --> 03:03:24.193
ADDITIONAL DELAY AND THE

03:03:24.259 --> 03:03:26.795
METHODOLOGY. IT MADE SENSE WE'RE

03:03:26.862 --> 03:03:27.629
IN THE MIDDLE OF A GLOBAL

03:03:27.696 --> 03:03:29.498
PANDEMIC NOTHING IS A STEADY

03:03:29.565 --> 03:03:31.834
STATE RIGHT NOW AND SO DELAYING

03:03:31.900 --> 03:03:33.068
IT A COUPLE OF YEARS MAKES SENSE

03:03:33.135 --> 03:03:34.903
BUT WE ARE IT WORK HURTING

03:03:34.970 --> 03:03:36.538
COUNTIES ARE REALLY HURTING IN

03:03:36.605 --> 03:03:37.639
THIS PROGRAM AND- SO WE

03:03:37.706 --> 03:03:45.147
ENCOURAGE YOUR SUPPORT. OF THAT

03:03:45.214 --> 03:03:46.115
AT THE BRANCH. COUPLE MORE

03:03:46.181 --> 03:03:48.083
COMMON HERE- ARE MOVING NEEDLE

03:03:48.150 --> 03:03:48.717
AS FAR TAKE. AND RETAINING OF

03:03:48.784 --> 03:03:50.285
THE- WE THINK THAT WERE. MANY I

03:03:50.352 --> 03:03:52.888
THINK MOST. FOR CDS AFTER

03:03:52.955 --> 03:03:54.556
SHOPPING EXPLAINING THAT CHANGES

03:03:54.623 --> 03:03:57.526
. IN AB SEVENTY NINE THAT TWENTY

03:03:57.593 --> 03:03:58.260
TWENTY TWENTY ONE TRAILER BILL

03:03:58.327 --> 03:03:59.828
THAT INCORPORATED MOST ASPECTS

03:03:59.895 --> 03:04:01.930
OF THE BILL BY CHAIR TANK. THAT

03:04:01.997 --> 03:04:04.166
WE SPONSORED AT CEDAR BDA IT

03:04:04.233 --> 03:04:06.101
REALLY PROVIDED SIGNIFICANT

03:04:06.168 --> 03:04:06.835
CHANGES AND IMPROVEMENTS NOT

03:04:06.902 --> 03:04:08.637
JUST YOU. I'M GETTING PEOPLE ON

03:04:08.704 --> 03:04:10.806
TO THE PROGRAM BUT ALSO MAKING

03:04:10.873 --> 03:04:13.075
SURE THAT WE RETAIN. OF THE PRE

03:04:13.142 --> 03:04:14.743
POPULATED FORM IN THIS HERNANDEZ

03:04:14.810 --> 03:04:17.045
MENTIONS REALLY EXCITING. I

03:04:17.112 --> 03:04:19.281
THINK- AS I ALLUDED TO IN THE

03:04:19.348 --> 03:04:21.850
POWER SECTOR MONEY- IT WOULD BE

03:04:21.917 --> 03:04:23.685
GREAT TO BE ABLE TO GO FURTHER.

03:04:23.752 --> 03:04:25.087
THANK ELIPORT IN POLICY LAB

03:04:25.154 --> 03:04:26.655
RECENTLY DID SOME ANALYSIS OF

03:04:26.722 --> 03:04:28.524
CALFRESH DATA. AND THEY FOUND

03:04:28.590 --> 03:04:30.459
NOT A SURPRISE PEOPLE TEND TO

03:04:30.526 --> 03:04:32.594
DROP OFF AT RENEWAL OR WHEN

03:04:32.661 --> 03:04:34.196
THEY'RE FILLING IN THAT SEMI

03:04:34.263 --> 03:04:35.230
ANNUAL REPORT IN THE MIDDLE OF

03:04:35.297 --> 03:04:37.099
THE YEAR. BASICALLY WHEN THERE'S

03:04:37.166 --> 03:04:38.567
A PAPERWORK REQUIREMENT SOMEONE

03:04:38.634 --> 03:04:40.169
HAVE TO MAKE THAT REPORT. IT CAN

03:04:40.235 --> 03:04:41.770
RESULT IN A DROP BOX OF

03:04:41.837 --> 03:04:43.739
ELIGIBILITY FOR PEOPLE WHO.

03:04:43.806 --> 03:04:45.607
OTHERWISE ARE ELIGIBLE BUT THEY

03:04:45.674 --> 03:04:47.276
JUST DIDN'T GET THE FORM ACT.

03:04:47.342 --> 03:04:48.510
AND SO THE BEST WAY TO STOP THIS

03:04:48.577 --> 03:04:50.946
IS JACK MINIMIZE OR ELIMINATE

03:04:51.013 --> 03:04:52.681
THE REPORTING IN. THE SEMI

03:04:52.748 --> 03:04:55.150
ANNUAL REPORT- AS I KIND OF

03:04:55.217 --> 03:04:57.152
AGAIN ALLUDED TO IN THE PRIOR

03:04:57.219 --> 03:04:58.887
PANEL WOULD REQUIRE FEDERAL

03:04:58.954 --> 03:05:00.689
ADVOCACY TO BE ABLE TO ELIMINATE

03:05:00.756 --> 03:05:02.658
THAT FOR CALFRESH- IT MAY BE

03:05:02.724 --> 03:05:04.159
WORTH PURSUING WE THINK WE'RE

03:05:04.226 --> 03:05:05.828
NOT THE ONLY STATE. THAT WOULD

03:05:05.894 --> 03:05:07.529
BE INTERESTED IN THAT I COULD

03:05:07.596 --> 03:05:09.064
MAKE A CASE THAT WOULD BENEFIT.

03:05:09.131 --> 03:05:10.766
HUNGRY PEOPLE WHO ARE REALLY

03:05:10.833 --> 03:05:12.968
ELIGIBLE FOR THE PROGRAM-

03:05:13.035 --> 03:05:18.907
OBVIOUSLY THOUGH WE. COULD WE

03:05:18.974 --> 03:05:19.808
CAN'T JUST DOTHAT ON OUR OWN.

03:05:19.875 --> 03:05:20.876
AND THEN FINALLY REGARD TO THE

03:05:20.943 --> 03:05:22.077
CLASS RELATED TO THE STATE

03:05:22.144 --> 03:05:22.978
HEALTH. REPORT WE APPRECIATE

03:05:23.045 --> 03:05:24.346
THAT THE STATE THE FINAL REPORT

03:05:24.413 --> 03:05:26.815
REALLY TARGETED IN ON A FEW KEY

03:05:26.882 --> 03:05:27.649
RECOMMENDATIONS. WILL BE WORKING

03:05:27.716 --> 03:05:29.151
WITH THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE

03:05:29.218 --> 03:05:31.220
OTHER STAKEHOLDERS TO SEE. HOW

03:05:31.286 --> 03:05:32.821
AND WHEN AND THE IDEAS COULD BE

03:05:32.888 --> 03:05:34.523
IMPLEMENTED AND WE THINK SOME OF

03:05:34.590 --> 03:05:36.058
THE IDEAS KIND OF PIGGYBACK ON

03:05:36.124 --> 03:05:39.194
EXISTING WORK IN AFRICA. SO THEY

03:05:39.261 --> 03:05:40.395
MIGHT BE EASIER TO GET. AS I

03:05:40.462 --> 03:05:42.231
WRAP UP I DO JUST WANT TO TAKE A

03:05:42.297 --> 03:05:43.632

STUDENTS- COURT ELIGIBLE

03:17:50.658 --> 03:17:52.694
ACTUALLY RECEIVING CALFRESH. WE

03:17:52.760 --> 03:17:54.229
MUST ACKNOWLEDGE FIRST THAT

03:17:54.295 --> 03:17:55.430
FEDERAL LAW AND REGULATIONS HAVE

03:17:55.496 --> 03:17:56.798
BEEN SPECIFICALLY STRUCTURED TO

03:17:56.864 --> 03:17:58.333
KEEP STUDENTS OUT OF THE SNAP

03:17:58.399 --> 03:18:01.035

REQUIREMENTS THAT ANY OTHER

APPLICANT WOULD. BUT TO ALSO

03:18:12.313 --> 03:18:13.281
DEMONSTRATE AND ENSURE THAT THE

EXEMPTION FROM THE STUDENT WILL

03:18:17.518 --> 03:18:18.519
. AND OF COURSE THIS MEANS THAT

03:18:18.586 --> 03:18:19.454
EACH TIME THERE'S A CHANGE IN

03:18:19.520 --> 03:18:20.622
POLICY ON HOW THOSE TWO

03:18:20.688 --> 03:18:22.123
APPLICATIONS CAN BE PROCESSED

03:18:22.190 --> 03:18:23.825
WATER RESULTING FROM FEDERAL OR

03:18:23.891 --> 03:18:25.493
STATE GUIDANCE. THIS MUST BE

03:18:25.560 --> 03:18:37.005
COMMUNICATED ACROSS. ALL FIFTY

03:18:37.071 --> 03:18:37.639
EIGHT COUNTIES WHICH CAMERAS IN

03:18:37.705 --> 03:18:38.640
INCOME AND PUT. OF SUCH. LIKE

03:18:38.706 --> 03:18:39.240
ALLOWING STUDENTS STOP THIRD

03:18:39.307 --> 03:18:55.189
THEIR. OF THE ACADEMIC YEAR AND

03:18:55.256 --> 03:18:56.391
THE TIMING OF STUDENTS MOVING

03:18:56.457 --> 03:18:58.293
INTO NEW COUNTIES ALSO CREATES A

03:18:58.359 --> 03:19:00.061
LARGE AND RECURRING SEASONAL

03:19:00.128 --> 03:19:02.630
SURGES APPLICATIONS. AT ALL

03:19:02.697 --> 03:19:04.265
ACADEMIC TERM BEGINS MANY

03:19:04.332 --> 03:19:05.366
COUNTIES WITH LARGE STUDENT

03:19:05.433 --> 03:19:07.035
POPULATIONS YOUR WAY OF

03:19:07.101 --> 03:19:08.169
APPLICATIONS THAT THAT AT THE

03:19:08.236 --> 03:19:09.537
SAME TIME. THIS CREATES REAL

03:19:09.604 --> 03:19:11.172
WORKLOAD ISSUES FOR STAFF THAT

03:19:11.239 --> 03:19:14.342
RESULT IN LONGER PROCESSING

03:19:14.409 --> 03:19:15.643
TIMES FOR STUDENT APPLICANTS. SO

03:19:15.710 --> 03:19:17.178
NOW THAT I'VE LAID OUT A FEW OF

03:19:17.245 --> 03:19:18.646
THE ISSUES THAT HINDER STEVEN

03:19:18.713 --> 03:19:20.181
ACCESS TO CALIFORNIA BRIEFLY

03:19:20.248 --> 03:19:21.149
TOUCH ON SOME OF THE

03:19:21.215 --> 03:19:21.983
RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WE'VE

03:19:22.050 --> 03:19:23.751
IDENTIFIED. TO HELP BETTER SERVE

03:19:23.818 --> 03:19:25.820
STUDENTS. WE BELIEVE THAT

03:19:25.887 --> 03:19:27.021
CALIFORNIA CAN PILOT NEW

03:19:27.088 --> 03:19:28.089
APPROACHES THAT WOULD HELP

03:19:28.156 --> 03:19:29.424
SUPPORT STUDENT ACCESS TO THE

03:19:29.490 --> 03:19:32.527
PROGRAM- ONE OF WHICH BEING-

03:19:32.593 --> 03:19:33.861
ESTABLISHING REGIONAL HUBS THE

03:19:33.928 --> 03:19:35.129
COUNTIES AS IS CURRENTLY

03:19:35.196 --> 03:19:36.631
UTILIZED IN THE CASH ASSISTANCE

03:19:36.698 --> 03:19:38.299
PROGRAM FOR IMMIGRANTS. IT WOULD

03:19:38.366 --> 03:19:39.934
HAVE A SPECIALLY TRAINED TEAM OF

03:19:40.001 --> 03:19:41.903
COUNTY ELIGIBILITY WORKERS OKAY

03:19:41.969 --> 03:19:44.739
FONG PROCESSING STUDENT

03:19:44.806 --> 03:19:45.340
APPLICATIONS FROM WITHIN THEIR

03:19:45.406 --> 03:19:46.708
CONSORTIUM. AS CALIFORNIA

03:19:46.774 --> 03:19:48.142
CONSIDERS EXPANDING ACCESS

03:19:48.209 --> 03:19:49.410
PROGRAM FOR IMMIGRANT AND

03:19:49.477 --> 03:19:51.212
UNDOCUMENTED COMMUNITIES. WE

03:19:51.279 --> 03:19:52.480
WOULD ALSO SUGGEST CONSIDERING

03:19:52.547 --> 03:19:54.449
THE USE ON A PILOT BASIS OF THE

03:19:54.515 --> 03:19:56.284
CALIFORNIA DREAM ACT APPLICATION

03:19:56.351 --> 03:19:57.719
JUST URBAN DOCUMENTED STUDENTS

03:19:57.785 --> 03:19:59.053
THAT ARE ALREADY PROVIDING THEIR

03:19:59.120 --> 03:20:00.488
INFORMATION TO THE STATE FOR

03:20:00.555 --> 03:20:02.523
FINANCIALLY PURPOSES. THIS CULD

03:20:02.590 --> 03:20:04.092
ULTIMATELY SERVE AS A PILOT FOR

03:20:04.158 --> 03:20:05.560
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO

03:20:05.626 --> 03:20:06.060
CONSIDER MAKING THIS IN

03:20:06.127 --> 03:20:08.496
PRACTICE- AVAILABLE WITH THE USE

03:20:08.563 --> 03:20:10.131
OF THE FREE APPLICATION FOR

03:20:10.198 --> 03:20:11.232
FEDERAL STUDENT AID. THE PASS

03:20:11.299 --> 03:20:13.234
UP. SO THAT THEY ARE ALSO

03:20:13.301 --> 03:20:16.437
CONSIDERED FOR SNAP BENEFITS

03:20:16.504 --> 03:20:17.071
WITHOUT SUBMITTING AN ADDITIONAL

03:20:17.138 --> 03:20:18.139
APPLICATION. WE CAN ALSO LOOK AT

03:20:18.206 --> 03:20:19.273
HOW WE CAN BETTER LEVERAGE DATA

03:20:19.340 --> 03:20:21.409
AND A FEW KEY WAYS. FIRST WE

03:20:21.476 --> 03:20:22.410
BELIEVE THAT CALIFORNIA MUST

03:20:22.477 --> 03:20:23.811
START TO TRACK ACTUAL AND NOT

03:20:23.878 --> 03:20:25.813
ESTIMATED STUDENT APPLICATIONS

03:20:25.880 --> 03:20:27.849
AND ACCEPTANCE INTO THE PROGRAM.

03:20:27.915 --> 03:20:29.083
WE CAN ALSO LOOK TO SEE HOW WE

03:20:29.150 --> 03:20:31.018
CAN AT A MINIMUM PRE POPULATE

03:20:31.085 --> 03:20:32.820
THE CALPERS SHOP LOCATION WITH

03:20:32.887 --> 03:20:34.822
FINANCIAL AID APPLICATION DATA.

03:20:34.889 --> 03:20:35.990
TO REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF

03:20:36.057 --> 03:20:36.858
REDUNDANT QUESTIONS THAT WE'RE

03:20:36.924 --> 03:20:38.893
ASKING STUDENTS. AS WELL AS

03:20:38.960 --> 03:20:40.528
UTILIZED FREE AND REDUCED PRICE

03:20:40.595 --> 03:20:42.397
MEAL DATA FROM OUR K. TWELVE

03:20:42.463 --> 03:20:43.798
PARTNERS TO IDENTIFY STUDENTS

03:20:43.865 --> 03:20:47.368
LIKELY ELIGIBLE FOR CALFRESH AT

03:20:47.435 --> 03:20:48.302
THE MATRICULATION TO HIGHER

03:20:48.369 --> 03:20:49.570
EDUCATION. AND OF COURSE WE MUST

03:20:49.637 --> 03:20:50.838
ALSO SUPPORTER COUNTIES IN THE

03:20:50.905 --> 03:20:52.874
WORK OF PROCESSING APPLICATIONS.

03:20:52.940 --> 03:20:54.142
CALIFORNIA SHOULD USE THE

03:20:54.208 --> 03:20:55.777
FUNDING FORMULA TO APPROPRIATELY

03:20:55.843 --> 03:20:56.944
RECOGNIZE COUNTIES EXISTING

03:20:57.011 --> 03:20:59.180
WORKLOADS AND CREATE INCENTIVES

03:20:59.247 --> 03:21:00.782
FOR COUNTIES TO GENERATE AND

03:21:00.848 --> 03:21:02.750
PROCESS ADDITIONAL CASES. WE

03:21:02.817 --> 03:21:04.485
MUST ALSO EXPAND COMMUNICATIONS

03:21:04.552 --> 03:21:06.254
EFFORTS TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE

03:21:06.320 --> 03:21:07.522
CONSISTENTLY IMPLEMENTING. NEW

03:21:07.588 --> 03:21:08.956
ACCESS POLICIES FOR STUDENTS

03:21:09.023 --> 03:21:11.993
ACROSS ALL OF OUR IT DETECTS.

03:21:12.059 --> 03:21:13.828
FINALLY A BENEFITS ARE ONLY

03:21:13.895 --> 03:21:15.396
HELPFUL TO STUDENTS TO THE

03:21:15.463 --> 03:21:16.397
EXTENT THAT THEY CAN ACTUALLY

03:21:16.464 --> 03:21:17.932
UTILIZE THEM. WE SHOULD ENSURE

03:21:17.999 --> 03:21:19.100
THAT STUDENTS CAN UTILIZE THEIR

03:21:19.167 --> 03:21:21.002
CALPERS BENEFITS ON CAMPUS BY

03:21:21.068 --> 03:21:21.869
DIRECTING COLLEGES AND

03:21:21.936 --> 03:21:23.905
UNIVERSITIES TO ACCEPT EBT CARDS

03:21:23.971 --> 03:21:25.673

03:21:25.740 --> 03:21:27.141
GROWING NUMBER CAMPUS THAT IS

03:21:27.208 --> 03:21:28.476
ALREADY DONE THIS AND R. OR

03:21:28.543 --> 03:21:31.712
TAKING STEPS TO DO SO BUT

03:21:31.779 --> 03:21:33.014
THERE'S MORE WORK THAT CAN BE

03:21:33.080 --> 03:21:34.048
DONE. SO THAT CONCLUDES MY

03:21:34.115 --> 03:21:35.550
REMARKS FOR TODAY AND WE OF

03:21:35.616 --> 03:21:36.484
COURSE I LOOK FORWARD TO

DECLARATION OF AN EMERGENCY

03:30:02.089 --> 03:30:04.024

OF THOSE DOLLARS FOR FELT

03:30:22.109 --> 03:30:24.545
CALHOUN. IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO

03:30:24.611 --> 03:30:26.280
LIFT UP BECAUSE IT ACTUALLY

03:30:26.347 --> 03:30:28.215
GIVES OUR LOCAL FOOD BANKS THE

03:30:28.282 --> 03:30:30.184
ABILITY TO PURCHASE FOOD THAT

03:30:30.250 --> 03:30:31.585

WHERE WE CAN ALSO FURTHER

03:30:53.240 --> 03:30:55.809

03:48:03.703 --> 03:48:04.971
RELATIVELY RECENT EXPANSION FOR

03:48:05.038 --> 03:48:08.041

HAVE THE- ON HOW MUCH THEY'RE

03:48:38.104 --> 03:48:39.439
WORTH THE- THEY'RE GOING TO BE

03:48:39.505 --> 03:48:40.506
ABLE TO UNDERTAKE THE PROCESS OF

03:48:40.573 --> 03:48:42.208

SUSPENSE OF DENTAL INCREASE SAYS

03:48:48.581 --> 03:48:50.183

CHALLENGES AS WELL FROM THE

03:48:57.957 --> 03:49:00.460
FLEXIBILITIES OF THE SELECT FEET

03:49:00.526 --> 03:49:01.894
. A MAJOR BARRIER TO BEING ABLE

03:49:01.961 --> 03:49:04.564
TO SPEND THE FUNDS- CERTAINLY

03:49:04.630 --> 03:49:06.632
QUICKLY AND MAYBE AT ALL IN SOME

03:49:06.699 --> 03:49:09.235
CASES THOUGH I THINK- SPEED IS

03:49:09.302 --> 03:49:11.070
PROBABLY THE BIGGEST ISSUE. IS

03:49:11.137 --> 03:49:13.139
JUST- A LACK OF AFFORDABLE

03:49:13.206 --> 03:49:15.274
HOUSING STOCK THAT'S AVAILABLE

03:49:15.341 --> 03:49:17.743
WE KNOW THAT WE ARE FACING THAT

03:49:17.810 --> 03:49:19.679
ISSUE ACROSS THE STATE IT'S NOT

03:49:19.745 --> 03:49:21.681
JUST A LARGER URBAN AREA IS

03:49:21.747 --> 03:49:23.783
SMALLER COUNTIES RURAL COUNTIES

03:49:23.850 --> 03:49:24.851
IN OUR SUBURBAN COUNTIES ALL

03:49:24.917 --> 03:49:27.220
REPORT. THAT IT'S EXTREMELY

03:49:27.286 --> 03:49:29.522
DIFFICULT TO FIND AVAILABLE

03:49:29.589 --> 03:49:31.891
AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AND ALL SAY

03:49:31.958 --> 03:49:33.526
THAT I THINK DURING THE PANDEMIC

03:49:33.593 --> 03:49:34.594
EVEN THOUGH THE EVICTION

03:49:34.660 --> 03:49:35.628
MORATORIUM WHICH WE STRONGLY

03:49:35.695 --> 03:49:37.430
SUPPORT HAS BEEN A VERY GOOD

03:49:37.497 --> 03:49:40.133
THING FOR RENTERS- FAMILIES AND

03:49:40.199 --> 03:49:41.934
INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE AFFECTED OR

03:49:42.001 --> 03:49:44.036
ARE HOMELESS. I MADE IT MORE

03:49:44.103 --> 03:49:45.538
DIFFICULT TO FIND A PLACE FOR

03:49:45.605 --> 03:49:47.106
THEM IT'S MADE RENTS HIGHER

03:49:47.173 --> 03:49:48.674
OVERALL BUT THEY CAN'T FIND A

03:49:48.741 --> 03:49:50.576
VACANCY SO I THINK WHAT YOU'RE

03:49:50.643 --> 03:49:51.978
SEEING IN THE IN THE GENERAL

03:49:52.044 --> 03:49:53.946
HOUSING MARKET OR THINGS THAT.

03:49:54.013 --> 03:49:55.448

NOTICE WE KNOW THAT AFFECTION IS

03:50:10.563 --> 03:50:12.532
SO DAMAGING TO FAMILIES AND

03:50:12.598 --> 03:50:15.635
CHILDREN. IT LEADS TO JOB LOSSES

03:50:15.701 --> 03:50:17.436
NOT THE OTHER WAY AROUND- BUT

03:50:17.503 --> 03:50:19.005
THE FICTION ACTUALLY LEAD TO JOB

03:50:19.071 --> 03:50:21.307

AROUND HOW DSS HAD REPORTED THAT

AN ESTIMATED 85% OF FAMILIES.

03:52:18.557 --> 03:52:19.258
WHO ARE TOUCHING THE HOMELESS

WITH AND CAL WORKS AS A PROGRAM.

03:52:36.042 --> 03:52:37.777

03:52:37.843 --> 03:52:40.379
POVERTY AND SHOULD BE HELPING US

03:52:40.446 --> 03:52:42.381

MENTIONED IN MY REMARKS HOUSING

03:52:51.457 --> 03:52:52.792
INSTABILITY AND RISK OF

03:52:52.858 --> 03:52:55.194
HOMELESSNESS IS INTRINSICALLY

03:52:55.261 --> 03:52:57.096
CONNECTED TO ECONOMIC HARDSHIP

03:52:57.163 --> 03:52:59.365
SO THIS DATA POINT CAME OUT OF

03:52:59.432 --> 03:53:00.866
RESEARCH FROM THE CALIFORNIA

03:53:00.933 --> 03:53:03.602
POLICY LAB. AND STUDIES THAT

03:53:03.669 --> 03:53:05.671
THEY WERE DOING AND LOS ANGELES

03:53:05.738 --> 03:53:07.640
AND WHAT WE BELIEVE THIS MEANS

03:53:07.707 --> 03:53:10.276
IS THAT BECAUSE THAT HOUSING

03:53:10.343 --> 03:53:12.445
AFFORDABILITY IN CALIFORNIA

03:53:12.511 --> 03:53:15.081
ISSUE IS REALLY THE DRIVER OF

03:53:15.147 --> 03:53:17.516
HOMELESSNESS FAMILIES THAT ARE

03:53:17.583 --> 03:53:19.552
RECEIVING THAT HAVE LOW INCOME

03:53:19.618 --> 03:53:21.620
ARE AT GREATER RISK OF BECOMING

03:53:21.687 --> 03:53:23.923
HOMELESS. AND FAMILIES THAT HAVE

03:53:23.989 --> 03:53:26.726
SMALL CHILDREN AND FAMILIES THAT

03:53:26.792 --> 03:53:28.961
HAVE EXPERIENCED ANY INCIDENCE

03:53:29.028 --> 03:53:31.097
HOMELESSNESS PREVIOUSLY ARE AT

03:53:31.163 --> 03:53:32.331
GREATER RISK OF BECOMING

03:53:32.398 --> 03:53:34.734
HOMELESS SO WHAT WE CAN SEE FROM

03:53:34.800 --> 03:53:38.771
THAT IS THAT. M. BY EIGHT BY.

03:53:38.838 --> 03:53:41.173
CONNECTING FAMILIES DIRECTLY TO

03:53:41.240 --> 03:53:42.441
HOUSING SUPPORTS THROUGH THE

03:53:42.508 --> 03:53:44.076
HUSING SUPPORT PROGRAM AND

03:53:44.143 --> 03:53:45.211
THEY'RE BRINGING FAMILIES HOME

03:53:45.277 --> 03:53:47.113
PROGRAM AS WELL AS UTILIZATION

03:53:47.179 --> 03:53:48.714
OF LIKE HOW WORKS HOMELESS

03:53:48.781 --> 03:53:51.117
ASSISTANCE PROGRAM WE CAN

03:53:51.183 --> 03:53:53.386
DIRECTLY IMPACT AND SUPPORT

WITH HOUSING INSTABILITY. I WILL

03:53:58.858 --> 03:54:01.527
WITH YOU- THAT I BELIEVE MUCH OF

03:54:01.594 --> 03:54:03.129
THE HOMELESSNESS ISSUE IS AN

03:54:03.195 --> 03:54:05.331
AFFORDABILITY ISSUE BUT WHAT

03:54:05.398 --> 03:54:08.401
DOES IT SAY ABOUT THE PROGRAM.

03:54:08.467 --> 03:54:10.269
THE ASSISTANCE WITH WHICH THEY

03:54:10.336 --> 03:54:12.872
WERE JUST RECEIVING IF WITHIN A

03:54:12.938 --> 03:54:15.408
MONTH OF THEM BEING OFF THE

03:54:15.474 --> 03:54:18.477
PROGRAM THERE THEN HOMELESS. ARE

03:54:18.544 --> 03:54:21.781
THEY RECEIVING ENOUGH SUPPORT.

03:54:21.847 --> 03:54:24.650
OR IS THE SUPPORT MAKING IT ON

03:54:24.717 --> 03:54:26.519
AFFORDABLE FOR THEM TO RETAIN

03:54:26.585 --> 03:54:29.188
AND KEEP THEIR HOUSING AS I

03:54:29.255 --> 03:54:31.157
BELIEVE THAT THE FAMILIES WERE

03:54:31.223 --> 03:54:33.726
SEEING WHO ARE BECOMING HOMELESS

03:54:33.793 --> 03:54:35.961

03:54:36.028 --> 03:54:37.430
RIGHT BEFORE THEY BECOME

03:54:37.496 --> 03:54:39.799
HOMELESS REALLY SCREAMS TO ME

03:54:39.865 --> 03:54:41.867
ABOUT A SYSTEM THAT NEEDS TO BE

03:54:41.934 --> 03:54:44.270
IMPROVED SO WE CAN ATTEMPT TO

03:54:44.336 --> 03:54:46.338

03:54:52.745 --> 03:54:55.147
THAT THE TRANSITION THE CHANGING

03:54:55.214 --> 03:54:57.883

SEPARATED FROM FAMILY MEMBERS-

04:12:27.732 --> 04:12:28.833
LOSING A BREADWINNER AND BEING

04:12:41.946 --> 04:12:44.115
THIS CRITICAL PROGRAM TO PROTECT

04:12:44.182 --> 04:12:46.017
ON THE IMMIGRANT COMMUNITY. THE

04:12:46.084 --> 04:12:47.252
OTHER QUESTION I'VE BEEN ASKED

04:12:47.318 --> 04:12:48.720
TO ADDRESS AND I WILL TRY TO

04:12:48.786 --> 04:12:50.088
WRAP UP I'M IN STATE WITHIN THE

04:12:50.154 --> 04:12:51.656
TIME LIMIT IS- SOME OF THE

04:12:51.723 --> 04:12:52.857
CHALLENGES SURROUNDING I'M LEGAL

SERVICES AND AS I MENTIONED

04:12:54.392 --> 04:12:56.327
EARLIER CALIFORNIA'S WAIT. FOR

04:12:56.394 --> 04:12:58.162
THE GAME WE'RE SO LUCKY TO BE IN

04:12:58.229 --> 04:12:59.998
A STATE WHERE BOTH- OUR GOVERNOR

04:13:00.064 --> 04:13:02.000
AND THE LEGISLATURE RECOGNIZE

04:13:02.066 --> 04:13:04.102
THE IMPORTANCE OF INVESTING. AND

04:13:04.168 --> 04:13:05.503
PROTECTING OUR IMMIGRANT

04:13:05.570 --> 04:13:06.571
COMMUNITIES I THINK ONE OF THE

04:13:06.638 --> 04:13:08.172
BIGGEST CHALLENGES WE CONTINUE

04:13:08.239 --> 04:13:10.008
TO FACE IS HOW TO BE EXPAND THE

04:13:10.074 --> 04:13:12.877
POOL. OF INDIVIDUALS THAT CAN

04:13:12.944 --> 04:13:15.413
ACCESS- THESE SERVICES. AND LIKE

04:13:15.480 --> 04:13:16.514
I MENTIONED TRADITIONALLY YOU

04:13:16.581 --> 04:13:18.449
HAVE ORGANIZATIONS IN AREAS OF

04:13:18.516 --> 04:13:19.484
THE STATE THAT WOULD GREATLY

04:13:19.551 --> 04:13:21.753
BENEFIT FROM FUNDING BUT LACKS

04:13:21.819 --> 04:13:23.888
THE ORGANIZATIONAL CAPACITY. TO

04:13:23.955 --> 04:13:25.456
QUALIFY FOR THE FUNDING AND

04:13:25.523 --> 04:13:26.925
THAT'S WHERE PROGRAMS LIKE THE

04:13:26.991 --> 04:13:50.181
FELLOWSHIP PLAY A CRITICAL ROLE. WITHIN THEIR AREAS OF THE LAW

04:13:50.248 --> 04:13:52.250
ADVOCATES BELIEVE THERE'S ROOM

04:13:52.317 --> 04:13:53.685
TO INVOLVE OUR CURRENT STATUTE

04:13:53.751 --> 04:13:55.620
AND ALSO OUR FUNDING MODELS TO

04:13:55.687 --> 04:13:57.622
ADDRESS THESE CONCERNS. SOME OF

04:13:57.689 --> 04:13:59.424
THE IDEAS THAT HAVE BEEN TABLED-

04:13:59.490 --> 04:14:00.959
ON THESE ISSUES INCLUDING MOVING

04:14:01.025 --> 04:14:02.393
FROM WHAT'S CALLED A FEW PER

04:14:02.460 --> 04:14:04.362
CASE MODEL- TO A FULL TIME

04:14:04.429 --> 04:14:05.663
STAFFING MODEL TO ENABLE

04:14:05.730 --> 04:14:08.066
ORGANIZATIONS- TO KEEP STAFF ON

04:14:08.132 --> 04:14:09.834
LONGER TERM AS A SPECIALIZED IN

04:14:09.901 --> 04:14:11.135
THESE ISSUES AND I KNOW THIS IS

04:14:11.202 --> 04:14:13.938
SOMETHING. ADVOCATES AND CDSS

04:14:14.005 --> 04:14:15.640
HAVE BEEN EXPLORING AND ENGAGING

04:14:15.707 --> 04:14:16.741
ON. AS WELL AS EXPANDING

04:14:16.808 --> 04:14:18.242
RESOURCES TO ENSURE THAT NO

04:14:18.309 --> 04:14:19.711
FAMILIES ARE DEPORTED BASED ON

04:14:19.777 --> 04:14:21.012
PRIOR UNCONSTITUTIONAL

04:14:21.079 --> 04:14:22.981
CONVICTIONS- AND THAT'S YOU KNOW

04:14:23.047 --> 04:14:24.215
THE ISSUE THE FACING DOUBLE

04:14:24.282 --> 04:14:26.217
JEOPARDY SOMETIMES. AND SO IN

04:14:26.284 --> 04:14:27.518
CLOSING I WANT TO THANK THIS

04:14:43.267 --> 04:14:45.603
HAS BEEN AND WE ASK THAT WE HAVE

04:14:46.938 --> 04:14:48.439
PARTNER WITH ADVOCATES DEFINE

04:14:48.506 --> 04:14:49.841
THESE KINDS OF SOLUTIONS TO

04:14:49.907 --> 04:14:51.809
EQUITY GAPS. THE PROGRAM IN

04:14:51.876 --> 04:14:53.044

04:14:53.111 --> 04:14:54.646
WATER FLOWING FROM THE LAWS OF

04:15:02.553 --> 04:15:03.655
REGIONS HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO

04:15:03.721 --> 04:15:05.490
NOT ONLY IMPACT THOUSANDS. OF

04:15:05.556 --> 04:15:06.724
IMMIGRANT FAMILIES IN THE FUTURE

04:15:06.791 --> 04:15:08.192

OF TWENTY TWENTY WE ESTABLISH

04:16:55.733 --> 04:16:57.635
THAT AND TASIA RACISM AND

04:16:57.702 --> 04:17:00.004
XENOPHOBIA IS SYSTEMIC AND

04:17:00.071 --> 04:17:02.340
PERVASIVE. AND AS WE APPROACH

OUR TWO YEAR ANNIVERSARY IT'S

04:17:04.175 --> 04:17:05.510

LEADING IN INCIDENTS REPORTED IN

04:17:20.091 --> 04:17:22.293

04:17:22.360 --> 04:17:24.395
FORTY PERCENT. OF ALL OUR

04:17:24.462 --> 04:17:28.099
INCIDENTS. WE HAVE ALSO FOUND

04:17:28.166 --> 04:17:30.301

ALMOST TWICE AS MANY INCIDENTS

04:17:32.136 --> 04:17:34.238
AS MEN. MANY OF THE INCIDENTS

04:17:34.305 --> 04:17:36.040
ARE IN THE FORM OF RACIALIZED

04:17:36.107 --> 04:17:37.275
AND SEXUALIZED VERBAL

04:17:37.341 --> 04:17:40.211
HARASSMENT. AND THE MAJORITY ARE

04:17:40.278 --> 04:17:42.180
