RELIGIOUS DIVERSITY.

00:47:52.403 --> 00:47:54.805 region:rollup2
WE'RE A NATION THAT CAME INTO

00:47:53.637 --> 00:47:56.540 region:rollup2
EXISTENCE BECAUSE OF THE

00:47:54.805 --> 00:47:58.209 region:rollup2

CONCERNING RELIGION.

00:47:58.209 --> 00:48:02.279 region:rollup2
WE ACTUALLY HAVE IN OUR MOTTO

00:47:59.610 --> 00:48:03.381 region:rollup2
THAT WE ARE A NATION UNDER GOD.

00:48:02.279 --> 00:48:05.015 region:rollup2

00:48:03.381 --> 00:48:06.550 region:rollup2
WE TRUST.

00:48:05.015 --> 00:48:08.352 region:rollup2
AND SO WE HAVE BASICALLY PUT IN

00:48:06.550 --> 00:48:10.187 region:rollup2
EVERY SYMBOL THAT WE HAVE THE

00:48:08.352 --> 00:48:11.222 region:rollup2
IMPORTANCE OF GOT. THE

00:48:10.187 --> 00:48:12.490 region:rollup2
IMPORTANCE OF RELIGION IN

00:48:11.222 --> 00:48:13.824 region:rollup2
IMPORTANCE OF DIVERSITY OF THAT

00:48:12.490 --> 00:48:15.659 region:rollup2
RELIGION.

00:48:13.824 --> 00:48:17.061 region:rollup2
AND YET WE KNOW TOO OFTEN THAT

00:48:15.659 --> 00:48:18.596 region:rollup2
IS THAT SAME WAY IN WHICH THAT

00:48:17.061 --> 00:48:20.030 region:rollup2
RELIGION HAS BEEN A GUIDING

00:48:18.596 --> 00:48:22.833 region:rollup2
FORCE AND A SUPPORT FOR

00:48:20.030 --> 00:48:24.668 region:rollup2
DIVERSITY. IT HAS ALSO BEEN USED

00:48:22.833 --> 00:48:26.337 region:rollup2
TO BASICALLY DIVIDE AND TO

00:48:24.668 --> 00:48:28.339 region:rollup2
CONQUER AND TO DESTROY.

00:48:26.337 --> 00:48:29.840 region:rollup2

00:48:28.339 --> 00:48:31.609 region:rollup2
MORE THAN AFRICAN AMERICANS

00:48:29.840 --> 00:48:33.344 region:rollup2
WHO NOT ONLY WERE IN SLAVE IN

00:48:31.609 --> 00:48:34.979 region:rollup2
THIS COUNTRY BY THE POWER OF THE

00:48:33.344 --> 00:48:36.881 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT. BUT ALSO BY THE

00:48:34.979 --> 00:48:38.282 region:rollup2
POWER OF THE RELIGION.

00:48:36.881 --> 00:48:39.884 region:rollup2
THAT WHEN WE FOUGHT AGAINST

00:48:38.282 --> 00:48:41.385 region:rollup2
SEGREGATION IN THE SOUTH IT WAS

00:48:39.884 --> 00:48:42.887 region:rollup2

00:48:41.385 --> 00:48:44.155 region:rollup2
CITIZENS COUNCIL IN THE VARIOUS

00:48:42.887 --> 00:48:45.322 region:rollup2
RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATIONS THAT

00:48:44.155 --> 00:48:46.991 region:rollup2
FORMED AND SUPPORTED THE

00:48:45.322 --> 00:48:48.392 region:rollup2
SEGREGATION.

00:48:46.991 --> 00:48:50.294 region:rollup2
WHEN WE FOUGHT AGAINST THE IN OF

00:48:48.392 --> 00:48:51.762 region:rollup2
FOR INTEGRATION OF SCHOOLS AND

00:48:50.294 --> 00:48:53.097 region:rollup2
WAS SCHOOLS WERE SHUT DOWN IN

00:48:51.762 --> 00:48:54.965 region:rollup2
ARKANSAS AND VIRGINIA FOR AN

00:48:53.097 --> 00:48:56.167 region:rollup2
ENTIRE YEAR. IT WAS RELIGIOUS

00:48:54.965 --> 00:48:58.202 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATIONS THAT ACTUALLY

00:48:56.167 --> 00:48:59.336 region:rollup2
OPENED UP WHITE ONLY SCHOOLS IN

00:48:58.202 --> 00:49:00.971 region:rollup2
THE SOUTH TO MAKE SURE THAT MY

00:48:59.336 --> 00:49:02.573 region:rollup2
CHILDREN DID NOT YOU LOSE A YEAR

00:49:00.971 --> 00:49:04.108 region:rollup2
OF EDUCATION.

00:49:02.573 --> 00:49:05.543 region:rollup2
SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT RELIGION

00:49:04.108 --> 00:49:07.711 region:rollup2
WE RECOGNIZE THAT IT IS A

00:49:05.543 --> 00:49:09.547 region:rollup2
POWERFUL FORCE AND IT IS ALSO

00:49:07.711 --> 00:49:11.282 region:rollup2
ALWAYS BEEN A POWERFUL FORCE IN

00:49:09.547 --> 00:49:12.850 region:rollup2
THE LIFE OF AFRICAN AMERICANS.

00:49:11.282 --> 00:49:14.385 region:rollup2
WHO BELIEVE THAT BECAUSE THEY

00:49:12.850 --> 00:49:15.452 region:rollup2
HAVE THE POWER OF RIGHT THEY

00:49:14.385 --> 00:49:17.621 region:rollup2
COULD OVER ON THEY COULD

00:49:15.452 --> 00:49:19.023 region:rollup2
OVERCOME AN ARMY OF EVIL? AND AS

00:49:17.621 --> 00:49:20.791 region:rollup2
A RESULT OF THAT THEY USE THEIR

00:49:19.023 --> 00:49:22.293 region:rollup2
RELIGION TO STRENGTHEN THEM AND

00:49:20.791 --> 00:49:23.828 region:rollup2
TO PUSH FORWARD IN THE ISSUES

00:49:22.293 --> 00:49:26.497 region:rollup2
THAT WERE MOST IMPORTANT. AND SO

00:49:23.828 --> 00:49:27.698 region:rollup2

00:49:26.497 --> 00:49:28.632 region:rollup2
