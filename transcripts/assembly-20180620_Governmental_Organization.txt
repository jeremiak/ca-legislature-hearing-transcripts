MEETING TO ORDER -- STARTED IF YOU GO AHEAD AND NOTIFY THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THAT THE ONE THIRTY START TIME HAS COME AND GONE IT IS TIME TO COME TO WORK. WE WILL BEGIN -- AS A SUBCOMMITTEE UNTIL WE HAVE TIME TO ESTABLISH A QUORUM. LOOKING AT THE SIGN IN SHEET IT LOOKS LIKE WE HAVE NUMBER ONE ON OUR DOCKET SENATOR SKINNER. SENATOR YOU ARE. HERE ARE PREPARED -- TO WHILE US WITH THE LATEST PIECE OF LEGISLATION. APPRECIATE THAT -- CHAIR -- IT'S ALWAYS MY GOAL -- MY MAIN WITNESSES ON ITS WAY -- OKAY GREAT THEY ARE OKAY -- ANYWAY. I MEMBERS CHAIR MEMBERS THIS BILL SB. ELEVEN SIXTY FOUR IS A CONTINUATION OF THE GOOD WORK THE LEGISLATURE HAS DONE RECOGNIZING THAT CALIFORNIA IS HOME TO A PHENOMENAL SET OF SMALL BATCH ARTISAN CRAFT DISTILLERS [inaudible] AND UP UNTIL A FEW YEARS AGO WE WERE WOEFULLY BEHIND MANY OTHER STATES NEW YORK UTAH AND OTHERS COLLOREDO. IN REALLY PROMOTING OUR PARTISAN DISTILLERS AND WHAT I FOUND KIND OF INTERESTING ABOUT THAT IS THAT THOSE DISTILLERS JUST IN THE SAME ARE SORT OF CALIFORNIA FARM TO TABLE MOVEMENT. WHERE WE HAVE CELEBRATED OUR WINERIES OUR -- OUR RESTAURANTS THAT FEATURE OUR AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS MANY PER CRAFT DISTILLERS USE CALIFORNIA SOURCED INGREDIENTS AND THEIR DISTILLED PRODUCT REALLY FEATURES THAT. SO WHAT THIS BILL DOES. IN THAT ONGOING SUPPORT IS. ELIMINATES THE REQUIREMENT THAT CONSUMERS MUST DO IT TASTING PRIOR TO THEIR ABILITY TO PURCHASE AT THAT STORY THEY LEGISLATURE'S RD ALLOW THEM TO PURCHASE THE PRODUCT AT THE DISTILLERY. BUT UP INTO TOLD TODAY USE ALSO MUST DO THE TASTING. AND AS WE KNOW SOME PEOPLE MADE FOR WHATEVER REASON ON THAT PARTICULAR DAY NOT BE ABLE TO DO A TASTING SO WE WANT TO ALLOW THEM TO AT LEAST BE ABLE TO PURCHASE PRODUCT IF THEY'RE MISSING. IT ALSO INCREASES BY SMALL AMOUNT THE MAXIMUM VOLUME THAT HE CRAFT DISTILLER CAN MANUFACTURE OR PRODUCE IN ORDER TO BE CONSIDERED A CRAFT DISTILLER. AND IT MAKES SEVERAL CLARIFYING IN MINOR CHANGES TO THE TYPES SEVENTY FOUR LICENSE AND WITH THAT I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE MY WITNESSES WHO ARE HERE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT. TESTIFY. MY CRAFT DISTILLER WITNESSES. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS CRYSTAL AND I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR THE CALIFORNIA ARTISANAL DISTILLERS GUILD I AM ALSO A MEMBER -- IONE DRY DIGGINGS AND AMADOR DISTILLERY. AND LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING THAT YOU'VE DONE FOR US OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS AND READER REITERATE THE NEED. FOR SOME OF THESE CHANGES AS WE CONTINUE TO GROW AS AN INDUSTRY WITH IN CALIFORNIA. BUT I'D LIKE TO TURN -- THAT THE TABLE OVER -- TO WE HAVE LANCE -- WITH ST GEORGE SPIRITS AND WE HAVE NO CAN FROM A GREEN BAR DOWN LOS ANGELES [inaudible] GOOD AFTERNOON [inaudible] CHAIR. COMMITTEE -- I'D LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME -- MONEY WAS LANCE WINNERS I'M THE MASTER DISTILLER AND THE PROPRIETOR OF SAINT GEORGE SPIRITS -- AND I'M HERE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT NOT JUST OF THE BILL BUT OF SENATOR SKINNER -- THE SB -- ELEVEN SIXTY FOUR GOES GOES FURTHER AS THE SENATOR VERY ELOQUENTLY POINTED OUT TO BE ABLE TO HELP THE THE WORK THAT WAS ALREADY STARTED IN ESTABLISHING THE TYPES OF THE FOR LICENSE -- OUR INDUSTRY IS CONSTANTLY CHANGING THERE'S A LOT OF CONSOLIDATION IS TAKING PLACE AT THE DISTRIBUTOR LEVEL WE LIVE AND DIE BY WHAT OUR DISTRIBUTORS. TO BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THE THE INCREASE ON ON THAT THE NUMBER OF GALLONS ALLOWABLE FOR TYPES OF THE FOUR PROVIDES. IS THE ABILITY FOR A CRAFT DISTILLER TO REACH A LEVEL OF ECONOMIC SAFETY AND SURETIES -- AND SO THAT BY THE TIME THE UP BY A DISTRIBUTOR THEY KNOW THEY CAN MAKE IT TO THAT PLACE -- IT SAID IT'S SOMETHING THAT CAN BE VERY HELPFUL IN CREATING JOBS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND ALLOWING THESE DISTILLERIES W. YET TO BE STABLE ENTITIES -- IT DOES PROVIDE SOME GREATER -- GREATER LATITUDE FOR CREATIVITY BY ALLOWING THE IMPORT OF CERTAIN PRODUCTS TO BE ABLE TO BE PLANTED AT THE DISTILLERY'S WHICH IS ALSO VERY HELPFUL -- AND THEN PROVISIONS THAT WERE. THERE WERE INCIDENTALLY TAKEN AWAY WHEN THE TYPES OF BEFORE WAS CREATED THAT WOULD ALLOW -- CRAFT DISTILLER TO BE ABLE TO DO TASTINGS IN RETAIL ACCOUNTS WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT OTHER -- DISTILLED SPIRITS PRODUCERS HAVE THAT WE HAD BEFORE WE BECAME A TYPE -- SEVENTY FOUR AS WELL AS THE ABILITY -- TO TO CONTRIBUTE TO NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS THAT SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN A VERY VERY IMPORTANT PART OF THE LAST THIRTY SIX YEARS OF OUR HISTORY AT STANFORD SPIRITS BEING ABLE TO BE. GOOD MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITIES BEING ABLE TO MAKE DONATIONS TO HELP SUPPORT THESE NONPROFITS AND WE'D LIKE TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THAT ABILITY COME BACK WHICH IS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT SB. ELEVEN SIXTY FOUR HELPS US TO DO SO I I I HOPE THAT YOU CAN GIVE US YOUR VERY THOUGHTFUL CONSIDERATION AND THAT. HOPEFULLY WE'LL FORWARD THANK YOU [inaudible] OKAY. THANK YOU THANK YOU EVERYONE. WELL AMERICAN BECAUSE OR BEYOND COFOUNDER AND SPIRITS MAKE RIGHT GREEN BAR SILVERY. WHERE FOURTEEN YEAR OLD CRAFT US THAT THE READ WITH THE FIRST IN LOS ANGELES SINCE PROHIBITION AND ONE OF THE OLDEST IN THE COUNTRY? AND I AGAIN OR YOU KNOW ALONG WITH LANCE AND CHRIS WANT TO THANK YOU FOR ALL YOUR HARD WORK OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS TO ALLOW US TO BECOME. A BETTER MEMBER OF THE COMMUNITIES AND TO ENGAGE OUR COMMUNITIES IN WHAT WE DO. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I'M REALLY PASSIONATE ABOUT A GREEN BAR IS SHARING WHAT WE DO. WITH OUR CUSTOMERS AND WITH IT WITH A COMMUNITY OF ENTHUSIASTS THAT PATRONIZE US. AND AS WITH CRAFT BREWERS AS WITH FAMILY WINEMAKERS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO REALLY EMBRACES. OPENING US UP TO THE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE VERY CURIOUS AND VERY INTERESTED IN WHAT CRAFT DISTILLING IS ALL ABOUT. IT ALONG WITH EVERYTHING ELSE THAT WE CAN DRINK THE HAS GONE FROM MASS PRODUCTION TO CRAFT. OUR CUSTOMERS ARE VERY CURIOUS ABOUT WHAT EXACTLY IT TAKES TO MAKE SPIRITS YOU KNOW HOW DO WE MAKE IT WHO MAKES IT ONE OF THE INGREDIENTS THAT GO INTO IT. FOR WANT OF FROM OUR LOCAL FARMS AND ALLOWING US TO HAVE MORE FLEXIBILITY IN HAVING TASTING ROOMS THAT ARE NOT JUST IN THE BUILDINGS BUT CLOSE BY. WOULD LLOW US THAT FURTHER INTERACTION MEMBERS OF OUR OF OUR ENTHUSIAST COMMUNITIES TO REALLY ENGAGE WITH US AND UNDERSTAND. A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT WHAT -- WHAT WHAT THE SALARIES DO THE SECOND THING THAT I WANT TO WITH ENCOURAGE YOU TO TO EMBRACES ALLOWING THE INDUSTRY TO INVEST IN CALIFORNIA DISTILLERIES WITH A LITTLE BIT MORE LATITUDE? THERE ARE -- AS LANCE SAID HEATING INCREDIBLE AMOUNTS OF CONSOLIDATION IN THE IN THE DISTRIBUTION WORLD WHICH WHICH MAKES THE THE BAR TO BECOME A MEANINGFUL CUSTOMER OF THEIRS VERY HIGH. AND AS WE ATTEMPT TO GROW AND BECOME A BETTER MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY AND CONTRIBUTE MORE JOBS AND MORE TAXES TO OUR TO OUR STATE. WE NEED TO HAVE SMART MONEY INVESTED IN IN DISTILLERIES AND ALLOW US TO GROW. ALLOWING MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY OF THE OF THE SELLING COMMUNITY TO INVEST IN SMALL CALIFORNIA DISTILLERIES. WELL OUR MEMBERS TO GROW AND OUTPACE MEMBERS OF OTHERS AL OF OTHER STATES AND ALLOW ARE INDUSTRY HERE TO FLOURISH JUST AS CRAFT DISTILLERY GREAT JUSTICE CRAFT BREWERS HAVE FLOURISHED. AND AS FAMILY WINE MAKERS OF FLOORS CLOSER TO THINGS ARE REALLY WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO TO THINK ABOUT AND AND TO CONSIDER AND AS PART OF THIS BILL. THANK OKAY THE ADDITIONAL TESTIMONY I HAD SUPPORT. TESTIMONY IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS MEMBERS IN THE QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS WATER RATES. I'VE GOT A QUESTION. JUST IN THE HISTORY ON THIS ISSUE. OBVIOUSLY WE CREATED THE TYPES ON FOR LICENSE -- IN A LOBBYING BILL SEVERAL YEARS AGO I WAS INTIMATELY INVOLVED -- IN THOSE DISCUSSIONS BECAUSE WE WERE -- BROACHING SOME. PICK CLEAR LINES WITHIN THE THREE TIER SYSTEM THAT -- WOULD REPRESENT A KIND OF A A FUNDAMENTAL SHIFT IN IN THE WAY THE INDUSTRY WORKS. AT THAT TIME WE ARRIVED AT THE HUNDRED THOUSAND MARK RIGHT AND AS I RECALL -- DISCUSSIONS AROUND THAT WERE TOO NARROWLY FOCUS PROVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE ON TO DO SO QUOTE UNQUOTE SMALL GUY. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE ARTISAN DISTILLER? ARGOSY WERE SHIPPED OUT TO HER FIFTY THOUSAND WELL WHERE DO YOU ALL IN ALL DIRECTORS MOST OF THE AUTHOR AND OR THE WITNESSES. A PORT WHERE YOU ALL SEE. THE INDUSTRY GOING ARE WE GONNA BE BACK HERE THREE YEARS TALK ABOUT [inaudible] TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND OR WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT. WELL I WILL ALLOW THE WITNESSES TO RESPOND BUT I DID WANT -- TO GIVE MY ACKNOWLEDGEMENT A THANKS TO THE CHAIR. FOR YOUR ROLE IN -- ADVANCING THIS INDUSTRY AND THAT TYPE SEVENTY FOUR IS CREATED WHEN -- A TIME PERIOD I WAS OUT OF THE ASSEMBLY BEFORE IT CAME BACK TO THE SENATE SORT REALLY GREATLY APPRECIATED AND YOUR INTERACTION ON THIS BILL BUT IN TERMS OF WHERE THE INDUSTRY'S GROWN GOING. VERSES GROWING. WE HOPE IT'S GROWING IN TERMS OF NUMBERS OF BUT ON TERMS OF THEIR QUANTITY I WILL ALLOW THE WITNESSES TO RESPOND TO THAT. ONE I DON'T KNOW IF PERSON YOUR LANCE I'D I'D LIKE TO SAY THAT I I HOPE THAT IF WE'RE BACK HERE IN THREE YEARS IT SO THAT WE CAN ALL BE CELEBRATING ALL THE WHILE. S. THAT WERE IN JOINING TOGETHER BY AS MUCH AS I ENJOY COMING TO THE CAPITAL -- AYE RIGHT THE IDEA OF TRYING TO PUSH SOMETHING NEW THROUGH JUST DOESN'T. DOESN'T APPEAL AT ALL -- I WOULD. I WOULD SAY THAT. MY HOPE IS THAT AT THIS HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND GALLON LEVEL WHAT IT DOES IS IT DOES EQUIPMENT EVERYONE OF THE CALIFORNIA DISTILLERS WITH WHAT THEY NEED TO BECOME. MEANINGFUL PLAYERS -- AND BE ABLE TO EXIST AND BECOME ATTRACTIVE TO DISTRIBUTORS -- I DON'T YOU DE [inaudible] CENTRAL CHEERS AND THROUGHOUT THAT ENTIRE TIME WE'VE WE'VE WORKED WITH OUR DISTRIBUTORS WE WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH OUR DISTRIBUTORS AND THERE'S A GREAT DEAL OF SUCCESS IN OUR BUSINESS THAT I ATTRIBUTE TO OUR DISTRIBUTORS. BUT I ALSO KNOW THAT EARLY IN OUR HISTORY -- WE WOULD HAVE BEEN MUCH BETTER OFF WITH THESE LAWS -- WE WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO BE A MUCH BETTER PARTNER TO OUR DISTRIBUTORS RIGHT NOW HAD THAT OCCURRED. I THINK ABOUT OTHER STATES WITH THESE THINGS HAVE OCCURRED AND WHERE WHERE THERE ARE MUCH MORE LIBERAL LAWS TO TO BE ABLE TO GO TO MARKET AS A SMALL THE STILLER. AND THE DISTILLERS THAT ARE OUT THERE UNDER THOSE SMALL DISTILLER CAPS THAT ARE THAT ARE. IN MANY CASES MUCH HIGHER THAN A HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND GALLONS THAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR HERE. THEY ARE GREAT PARTNERS TO THEIR DISTRIBUTORS EVERYWHERE BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN ABLE TO GENERATE ENOUGH REVENUE. TO BE ABLE TO GO OUT HEALTH THEIR DISTRIBUTORS MARKET THEIR PRODUCTS IN OTHER STATES THAT'S WHAT WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO DO WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO HAVE CALIFORNIA POT PRODUCTS. BE POINTS OF PRIDE ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND IT AROUND THE WORLD. SOME EDITOR BUT THAT TO ME WE'VE MISSED THE MARK ON THE HUNDRED THOUSAND IN THE FIRST DRAFT AS FAR AS A ACADEMICALLY VIABLE MODELER. ON DUTY FOR SOME OF THE SMALLER DISTILLERS THAT WORK IT'S IT'S A PART OF IT IT'S ALSO IT'S ALSO A TESTIMONY TO HOW DYNAMIC THE ENTIRE INDUSTRY IS RIGHT NOW AND HOW THAT THE LANDSCAPE IS CHANGING AT THE DISTRIBUTOR LEVEL.

JERRY BROWN AND ON BEHALF ELECTED CHANCES CASINO PINNACLE CASINO RANCHERS CLUBS YOU KNOW MERCED CASINO MADERA STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY ADDITIONAL TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE QUESTIONS FROM THE MEMBERS. MISTER COOPER I GOT SOME QUESTIONS SO THE FIVE BOARD MEMBERS OPEN BY THE GOVERNOR. AND I GUESS MY ISUES GOVERNOR APPOINTS A FIVE MEMBERS. AND HAVE BEEN VICTIMS FOR AWHILE BUT SINKING ELECT A OR B. SELANNE BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS THE GOVERNOR APPOINTS THE PUBS THE GOVERNOR SO. THIS BILL WILL NOT CHANGE THAT CHANGES THE REQUIREMENTS. OF THERE BACKGROUND BUT SUBSTANTIALLY DOESN'T COVER. THE GOVERNOR APPOINTING MEMBERS THAT BOARD. YET THAT IS CORRECT BUT AGAINST ME GIVES HIM MORE OPTIONS SO YOU'RE NOT JUST STUCK WITH ONE PARTICULAR. IN A FIELD. MY I GOT MY BUT WE'RE JUST TRYING TO HELP THEM ALONG A MINUTE AND I THINK WE'RE GONNA HAVE A NEW GOVERNOR HERE. FIRST GOT HELP YOURSELF. YOU MEAN THAT THE ADMINISTRATION BUT YOU'RE GOING CLOSE SESSION QUITE OFTEN AND YOU HAVE THE EXPERTISE TO DO WITH MONEY LAUNDERING. BUSINESS ISSUES LAW ENFORCEMENT ISSUE SO IT HELPS IN CLOSED SESSION TO HANDLES EXPERTISE THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE DIFFERENT BACKGROUNDS THE REQUIRED BY THE VARIOUS COMMISSIONERS. MAY BRING THEIR WIDE SPECTRUM OF EXPERIENCE AND BACKGROUNDS NAM. ALSO WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT YOU WANT A FULL TO APPLY THEIR CANDIDATES HER APPLYING THAT HAVE -- CRIMINAL BACKGROUNDS BEEN ARRESTED BEFORE SLEEP DEAL WITH THAT'S WHAT'S IMPORTANT LAW ENFORCEMENT. TESTIMONY IS SCI FI APPLICANTS. A PACKAGE YOU REFLECT ON THEIR LAW ENFORCEMENT EXPERIENCE AND ALSO OFFER TO PROCEDURES AND ALSO FINANCE -- SUPPORT HAVE SOME IN FINANCE IS LIKE IF YOU HAVE A GROUP OF FIVE INDIVIDUALS FULLER CT OURS THE CHARTER CURRENCY TRANSACTION REPORTS HE'S BEEN OVER TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS GOT REPORTED. I KNOW THAT OUR FINANCIAL CRIME SO FOR ME HAVING THOSE INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE TRAINED IN THOSE VERY SPECIFICALLY. THAT'S THAT'S CRITICAL SO. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO HAVE FOLKS WITH THAT WITH THE EXPERTISE WITH ME AUGUST ALLOW THE SYMBOLS CONFLICTED WOODY INVOLVES MONEY LAUNDERING. AND THE TRAIL IS FOLLOW THE MONEY AND WE FOLLOW MONEY IS WITH FORCE OF LAW ENFORCEMENT'S BEARINGS AND FINANCIAL EXPERIENCE LIKE A SAID IN THE OWN STAFF REPORT [inaudible] IT SAYS. WHILE WE'RE THAT'S MEMBERSHIP REQUIREMENTS COULD CERTAINLY HELP FOR THE VACANT SEATS THIS BILL COULD ALSO HAVE AN UNFIT CONSEQUENCES OF DIMINISHING THE DIVERSE PROFESSIONAL BACKGROUNDS. PERSPECTIVES OF THE GAMING COMMISSION SO YOU COULD I FLY WORKERS ON THERE. ENOUGH NOT TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE BUT THE ROUTE PALMER THIS IS WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T HAVE FOLKS THERE. YOU KNOW AND ORGANIZE CRIME WERE COLLECTIVELY BECAUSE THE CHANCES THERE. INVOLVED THIS TYPE OF ACTIVITY SO I GUESS EXPERTISE COMES INTO PLAY EXPERTISE IMPORTANT. BECAUSE YOU KNOW THE DATE GOES BACK TO YOU THE ADMINISTRATION. IS FILLED WILL POINTS PEOPLE THAT'S NOT JUST COMMISSION IF A WIDE VARIETY OF COMMISSION BOARD STATEWIDE. THAT CAN'T FEEL THEY CAN'T FILL SO. TIMMY THAT'S THROUGH THE PROBLEM CHANGING THAT NERVOUSLY MAKE UP THE BOARD SO. I'M I'M NOT CONVINCED BEING IN LAW ENFORCEMENT I'M A LOCAL GOVERNMENT. THAT IS THE GOOD REASON TO CHANGE THIS EXPERTISE NEED FOR THAT REASON. THAT'S I LOVE TO HEAR YOUR COMMENTS ON THAT. LIKE. WE JUST DISAGREE AYE I THINK HAVING THAT HAVE NOBODY THERE IS WORSE THAN. HAVING QUALIFIED PEOPLE BUT IT GOES BACK TO THE FUNDAMENTAL POINT. THE GOVERNOR APPOINTS THE PEOPLE SO YOU MAY STILL HAVE THAT PROBLEM IS NOT FROM LACK OF PURE PLAY ATTORNEYS OUT THERE. PLENTY OF RETIRED COPS OUT THERE. IN THE FINANCIAL PERSONS OUT THERE SO AS FAR AS THAT SPECIFIC BILL SPECIFIC AREAS OF EXPERTISE ARE PUTTING OUT THERE. AND IT'S NOT FOR LACK OF APPLICANTS IT'S JUST LACK OF APPOINTING THOSE PEOPLE. THAT'S THAT'S TO ME THAT'S WHERE THE BIG ISSUE [inaudible] CONDITIONAL LA. MR HUBER FRAME A THIS WAS A ENABLE THE GOVERNOR MORE FLEXIBILITY TO APPOINT MORE QUALIFIED PEOPLE AS YOU'RE POINTING TO RIGHT NOW WE ONLY HAVE ONE LAW ENFORCEMENT SEE. THIS WOULD GIVE HIM THE OPPORTUNITY IN COURT MORE LAW ENFORCEMENT PEOPLE WITH BACKGROUND YOU'RE EXACTLY DESCRIBING RIGHT NOW WE'RE LIMITED TO ONLY ONE MEMBER. WAS JUST GIVING THAT CALL OF THE THE ABILITY FOR THE MOST QUALIFIED PEOPLE AT THAT TIME. WOULD YOU KNOW GREATLY HELP FILL THE SEATS SO VERY MEANS MCHALE'S BECAUSE THE LACK OF A QUORUM -- TO THIS POINT NOW KNOW SO WE'RE ONLY THREE SO NUMBER ONE NO REASON BEEN CANCELED. SO AND GOES BACK TO YOU DON'T NEED A BUDGET COPS ON THERE ARE MUCH RETURNEES ARE A BUNCH OF FINANCIAL. BACKGROUND INDIVIDUALS DOWN THERE YOU KNOW ONE FROM EACH SO ELECTRICITY GOES BACK. TO THEY ARE NOT HELD A MEETING CANCELED EVER. BECAUSE OF LEVEL POORLY STILL ME SO. IT COMES OUT FUNDAMENTALLY. THE GUNNERS GOT APPOINT PEOPLE. THAT THAT'S THROUGH THE PROBLEM AYE YOU I DON'T CARE ABOUT SAYING I'M NOT FROM OF FREE THAT. SO APPOINT THE PEOPLE IS SOLVE THE PROBLEM. SO UP TO NOW HASN'T BEEN A PROBLEM SINCE LIKE ANSWER LOOKING FOR PROBLEM RIGHT NOW. BECAUSE IT HAD THE MEETINGS SO I THIS IS I MEAN TO ME IT'S A AND BILL LOOKING FOR AN ANSWER SO I DEFTLY NON SUPPORTER THIS MISTER GORE. BIGGEST CHAIRMAN ED MAY FALL A LITTLE BIT OF MY COLLEAGUES OF QUESTIONS -- CAN YOU TALK ABOUT ANY DISCUSSIONS YOU HAD OF THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE ABOUT THE NEED FOR THIS BILL I RECOGNIZE THE PROBLEM YOU'RE TRYING TO SOLVE. THEM CURIOUS THEIR EXPERIENCES. IT IS HARDLY A STATE FORTY MILLION PEOPLE YOU CAN FIND OF FOLKS WHO CONSERVE OUR ON THIS COMMISSION SO WHAT WHAT WAS THEIR ANSWER FOR THE CHALLENGES FROM PHILLY NEEDS VACANCY. ALMA I SPOKE ABOUT THESE CHANGES ON THE FEEDBACK I GOT WAS THE FOR GREATER FLEXIBILITY WOULD WOULD HELP AND THEY'D BE SUPPORTIVE OF THE GREAT OF FLEXIBILITY -- ANOTHER ISSUE -- WE COME TO NOTE AND DISCUSSED. IS THE ADDITIONAL INCOME RIGHT NOW YOU HAVE A COMPLETE PROHIBITION ON OUTSIDE EMPLOYMENT -- SO MANY OF THESE PEOPLE IN THESE CERTAIN -- SPECIFIC AREAS HAVE OTHER BUSINESSES OR OTHER JOBS AND THAT REALLY RESTRICTS THEM FROM APPOINTED SO IF YOU FOR EXAMPLE OUT OF BUSINESS UNRELATED -- TO GAMBLING'S FOR EXAMPLE REAL ESTATE BUSINESS YOU WOULD BE PRECLUDED FROM FROM TAKING THAT SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'RE ALSO LOOKING AT ADDRESSING UP. IN THE NEXT COMMITTEE. IT WISE IN ADDRESS THE BILL NOW. I'M JUST SOMETHING THAT THAT CAME -- THROUGH DISCUSSIONS THAT THEY CAN ARE OUR EYES BUT WOULD BE WELCOME WORKING WITH -- THE CHAIRMAN AND PEOPLE TO ADDRESS THAT IN THE NEAR FUTURE A FIRST GLORIA YOU CAN CALL IT WHAT IT BASICALLY MEANS THAT I NOTICED THAT IS WHY MATCHING ALTHOUGH I I WOULDN'T. LEAVE THIS BUILDING SO ANYONE THAT HUNDRED FORTY GRAND YEAR. IS NOT ENOUGH TO IT TO GET BY UNDER UNDER FORTY TWO THOUSAND THEY CANNOT AFFORD. AS FOUNDING DOWN OKAY THANK YOU I APPRECIATE IT IF IT WOULD FIT ONE FORTY ONE FORTY TWO BY THE WAY THAT'S THAT'S A HECK OF A LOT MORE THAN MOST MY CONSTITUENTS MAKE SO. IT -- BUT YOU KNOW IF THAT'S A THAT'S A CONCERN TO ME EACH PARTICULAR THE WHOLE ISSUE. I DO QUIBBLE LITTLE BIT ABOUT -- OF THAT THE MATISSE BECAUSE I THINK ON A NONPROFIT BORDER RIGHT THIS IS A NONPROFIT WITH A GOOD BOOK FOR GOVERNANCE YOU DO HAVE PEOPLE WITH DIFFERENT BACKGROUNDS -- I HEAR WHAT YOU'RE SAYING ABOUT BEING ABLE TO ACTUALLY LOADED UP WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT IT PROVIDES ADDITIONAL. ABILITY BUT DAMN IF AYE IF THE POINT AUTHORITIES HAVING DIFFICULTY YOU'D BE INTERESTING TO HAVE A BABY POLY BETTER HAVE A BILL THAT ADDRESSES ALL THAT. I HEAR YOU CENTER YOUR INTEREST IN TAKING THAT UP IN AN AND A FUTURE COMMITTEE. NONE DID I I'M NOT ADVOCATE I'M I'M JUST I'M ASKING FOR BEFORE THIS GETS TO THE FLOOR MAYBE SOMETHING I CAN'T SUPPORT YOU KNOW EXACERBATED TODAY -- YOU TO IS THAT IS THAT YOU INTEND TO FURTHER AMEND THIS TO TIM REMOVING A MORE POLITICIANS OFF A HOSTILE ACT AS A COMPOSITION. WE ALWAYS HAVE AN OPEN MIND BUT I I THINK RITE NOW OF THE WAY THE BILL IS THAT WE'RE GOING TO GO FORWARD WITH THAT TODAY. AND WE CAN ALWAYS YOU KNOW. WE GET WE ARE GONNA HAVE A NEW GOVERNOR MAYBE HE'LL GET ON THE STICK AND ACTUALLY POINT SOME PEOPLE. COOPER YOU HAVE ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS. THE OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE MEMBERS. JERRY MEDICAL CERTAINLY THAT CONCLUDE THE DISCUSSION WAS AND I I TEND TO SHARE -- SOME OF THE SENTIMENT. THAT BOTH MISTER COOPER MISTER GOREY RAISE THAT THERE I'M NOT SURE THIS BILL AS IT'S CURRENTLY DRAFTED -- IS THE PERFECT SOLUTION I THINK DIRECT INDIA ISSUE AS IT RELATES TO OUTSIDE EMPLOYMENT. IS A VALID ONE IS WELL WE'RE TALKING ABOUT LIMITING OUR POOL AND THAT'S NOT TO DISAGREE WITH MISTER GORE THE HUNDRED FOR TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS IS A LOT OF FUN. MONEY OUT FOR POSITION BUT IN FACT IT ALSO DOES LIMIT. THE POOL OF INDIVIDUALS ARE THEY GAGE THIS ACTIVITY I'M ALSO NOT ENTIRELY CONVINCED THAT -- SOMETIMES GOVERNOR'S JUST START FOCUSED -- IN ALL AREAS THAT THEY NEED TO BE FOCUSED WHEN IT COMES THEIR APPOINTMENTS AND FOR SOME REASON WAIT TILL THE FINAL MONTHS OF THE ADMINISTRATION TO MAKE A LOT OF APPOINTMENTS -- THAT'S ABOUT ISSUE AS WELL SO. ALL THAT BEING SAID I GIVE YOU TWO OPTIONS ONE YOU CAN KEEP THE BILL HERE TODAY WE CAN KEEP WORKING ON IT. OR WE CAN -- YOU'LL HAVE MY SUPPORT TODAY AND WE CAN -- WORK ON IT YOU KNOW -- AS IT. CONTINUES TO MOVE THROUGH THE PROCESS AND SEE IF WE CAN'T PERHAPS -- ADD SOME REFINING TOUCHES TO THIS LEGISLATION I'M VERY PLIABLE [inaudible] OKAY. MY FAVORITE KIND SENATOR.

UNDER CURRENT LAW ONLY CITIES AND COUNTIES CAN DECLARE A LOCAL EMERGENCY. THIS BILL IS A TECHNICAL MEASURE WHICH WILL CLARIFY THAT LOCAL CITIES AND COUNTIES CAN DECLARE A LOCAL EMERGENCY IMPORT DISTRICTS. LOCATED WITHIN THEIR LIMITS SOME PORTS SUCH AS THE PORT OF STOCKTON AND UNIFIED PORT OF SAN DIEGO. HAVE TERRITORIAL LIMITS WHICH SPAN ACROSS MULTIPLE CITIES AND COUNTIES. THIS CAN MAKE DECORATIONS OF LOCAL EMERGENCIES COMPLICATED SHOULD ONE OCCUR. S. B.

SEEING NONE ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE MEMBERS [inaudible] MISTER BIGELOW. JUST CURIOUS -- AS I UNDERSTAND IT THE LAW ALREADY GIVES THIS -- POWER TO THE LOCAL AGENCIES THIS IS A GOVERNMENTAL AGENCY. WHAT'S THE REAL PURPOSE FOR THE REQUEST TODAY. MISTER BIGELOW IF I MADE CHASING AND SALAS AGAIN ON BEHALF OF THE POOR STOCKTON. MOST SPORTS WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE FOR INDEPENDENT PORTS SPECIAL DISTRICT PORTS. ARE DEPARTMENTS OF THE CITY IN THIS CASE THE PORT IS NOT A DEPARTMENT OF THE CITY SO THIS GIVES THEM THE AUTHORITY AS A CITY WOULD. HAVE THAT AUTHORITY TO DECLARE THE EMERGENCY. SO IT'S EXPANDING IT TO THE FOR INDEPENDENT SPECIAL DISTRICT PORTS. SPECIAL DISTRICTS ARE RECOGNIZE. AS A LOCAL AGENCY. KNOWN AS THE GOVERNMENT AND I HAS THE SAME. STANDING UP POWERS THAT'S WHEN CONFUSED HERE A LITTLE BIT. WHEN WHEN I STE? WHEN I READ THIS I AND AND REMEMBER MIGHT? THE BASIC DAYS OF IT BEING A SUPERVISOR SPECIAL DISTRICTS HAVE LEGAL STANDING. HELP ME OUT THERE PARTNER STANDING IS THE THE SPECIAL DISTRICTS UNDER THE HARBORS A NAVIGATION CODE DO NOT HAVE THIS AUTHORITY AND WHICH IS THE INTENT OF THE BILL IS TO EXPAND THE AUTHORITY TO THE FORCE. INDEPENDENT SPECIAL DISTRICTS UNDER THE HARBORS NAVIGATION CODE.
