01:41:05.893 --> 01:41:08.028
A RALLY ON BEHALF OF THE

01:41:08.095 --> 01:41:08.662
CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE

01:41:08.729 --> 01:41:10.164
AND RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION TO AB

01:41:10.230 --> 01:41:11.465
TWENTY TWENTY SIX. I WANT TO

01:41:11.532 --> 01:41:13.033
BEGIN BY STATING THAT THE

01:41:13.100 --> 01:41:14.168
CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE

01:41:14.234 --> 01:41:16.069
DOES NOT DISAGREE THAT SINGLE

01:41:16.136 --> 01:41:19.206
USE PLASTIC PACKAGING OR-

01:41:19.273 --> 01:41:20.707
PACKAGED IN GENERAL THAT REACHES

01:41:20.774 --> 01:41:22.443
THE ENVIRONMENT IS A POLLUTION

01:41:22.509 --> 01:41:24.711
THAT. NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED.

01:41:24.778 --> 01:41:26.280
CALCHAMBER AND ITS MEMBER

01:41:26.346 --> 01:41:30.451

AND RECYCLE OUR PRODUCTS- IN OUR

01:41:35.589 --> 01:41:37.424
PACKAGING I THINK THE QUESTION

01:41:37.491 --> 01:41:38.926
THAT WE REALLY FACE TODAY IS

01:41:38.992 --> 01:41:40.961
WHETHER BANNING PACKAGING THAT

01:41:41.028 --> 01:41:42.496
SERVES A CRITICAL FUNCTION FOR

01:41:42.563 --> 01:41:43.931
SHIPPING TRULY BILLIONS OF

01:41:43.997 --> 01:41:46.600
DOLLARS OF GOODS THROUGH THE-

01:41:46.667 --> 01:41:48.569
CALIFORNIA ECONOMY AS AS THE

01:41:48.635 --> 01:41:50.971
AUTHORS INDICATED. IS A GROWING

01:41:51.038 --> 01:41:51.839
SECTOR OF OUR ECONOMY SO WE

01:41:51.905 --> 01:41:53.640
DON'T DISAGREE WITH THAT- BUT

01:41:53.707 --> 01:41:55.476
CANDIDLY IF WE SIMPLY JUST BAN

01:41:55.542 --> 01:41:56.577
THIS PACKAGING THERE ARE

01:41:56.643 --> 01:41:57.878
UNINTENDED ENVIRONMENTAL

01:41:57.945 --> 01:41:59.246
CONSEQUENCES AND CERTAINLY

01:41:59.313 --> 01:42:01.248
ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES TO THE

01:42:01.315 --> 01:42:02.483
CALIFORNIA ECONOMY AND THE

01:42:02.549 --> 01:42:06.220
CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENT. AND IT

01:42:06.286 --> 01:42:07.354
IS WHY CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF

01:42:07.421 --> 01:42:08.121
COMMERCE. REALLY LOOK AT THE

01:42:08.188 --> 01:42:10.224
ISSUE OF. SINGLE USE PLASTIC

01:42:10.290 --> 01:42:12.960
PACKAGING AS HOW DO WE ACHIEVE A

01:42:13.026 --> 01:42:14.761
CIRCULAR ECONOMY IN CALIFORNIA

01:42:14.828 --> 01:42:17.331
THAT CREATES AND MARKETS UP PUTS

01:42:17.397 --> 01:42:19.066
THE FINANCIAL OBLIGATION ON THE

01:42:19.132 --> 01:42:21.735
PRODUCERS TO PAY FOR A MORE

01:42:21.802 --> 01:42:23.971
ROBUST RECYCLING PROGRAM WHICH-

01:42:24.037 --> 01:42:25.973
FOR DECADES CALIFORNIA EXPORTED

01:42:26.039 --> 01:42:29.243
ITS- ITS MATERIALS ABROAD AND

01:42:29.309 --> 01:42:30.077
NOW WE NEED TO DEVELOP THE

01:42:30.143 --> 01:42:31.411
INFRASTRUCTURE HERE IN

01:42:31.478 --> 01:42:33.113
CALIFORNIA SO WE MANAGE OUR OWN-

01:42:33.180 --> 01:42:36.383
MATERIALS. HOW DO WE CREATE

01:42:36.450 --> 01:42:37.985
THOSE AND MARKETS AND STORES

01:42:38.051 --> 01:42:39.419
REDUCE SUPERFLUOUS PACKAGING SO

01:42:39.486 --> 01:42:40.954
WE DON'T DISAGREE THAT THERE IS

01:42:41.021 --> 01:42:42.456
EXCESS PACKAGING THAT CAN BE

01:42:42.523 --> 01:42:44.958
REDUCED WE ALL AGREE IT IN

01:42:45.025 --> 01:42:46.960
INCENTIVIZING AND CREATING

IF YOU DO NOT. BECOME MORE

01:42:50.631 --> 01:42:52.432
EFFICIENT. AND ALL OF THESE

01:42:52.499 --> 01:42:55.102
IDEAS HAVE BEEN PUT FORTH. IN

01:42:55.168 --> 01:42:57.604
NOT ONLY DISCUSSIONS LAST YEAR

01:42:57.671 --> 01:42:59.406
BUT THIS YEAR AND A BROADER

01:42:59.473 --> 01:43:00.874
CIRCULAR ECONOMY DISCUSSION

01:43:00.941 --> 01:43:02.576
THAT'S GOING ON CURRENTLY SO WE

01:43:02.643 --> 01:43:04.878
FIND THAT A BAND BILL ON

01:43:04.945 --> 01:43:06.747

02:18:49.854 --> 02:18:51.690
AMOUNT OF WASTE THAT HAS TO BE

02:18:51.756 --> 02:18:52.991

02:19:28.326 --> 02:19:29.627
THINK MICHAEL AND IF THERE'S A

02:19:29.694 --> 02:19:32.897
WAY TO ACHIEVE THIS GOAL IN THAT

02:19:32.964 --> 02:19:34.099
ENSURE WE'RE LOOKING AT ALL

02:19:34.165 --> 02:19:36.000
OTHER. MEANS OF REDUCING WASTE

02:19:36.067 --> 02:19:38.369
BEFORE WE ARE PERMITTED A NEW

02:19:38.436 --> 02:19:40.705
LANDFILL AND IF THERE'S A BETTER

02:19:40.772 --> 02:19:42.841
WAY TO DO THAT. I'M DEFINITELY

02:19:42.907 --> 02:19:44.776
OPEN TO THAT I DO THINK WE COULD

02:19:44.843 --> 02:19:45.744

OUT WHEN THERE'S A WHEN THERE'S

02:19:50.615 --> 02:19:51.583
A WILDFIRE IN THEIR HOUSES

02:19:51.649 --> 02:19:54.652
INVOLVED- THE WASTE HAULERS

02:19:54.719 --> 02:19:56.421
COULD THE HOLLERS COME IN AND

02:19:56.488 --> 02:19:57.589
THEY THEY'VE THEY'VE LITERALLY

02:19:57.655 --> 02:19:58.890
WRAP IT UP IT'S LIKE A BIG

02:19:58.957 --> 02:20:02.160
BURRITO FOR LACK OF A- BATES

02:20:02.227 --> 02:20:03.161
PLASTIC AROUND IT. THAT'S TOXIC

02:20:03.228 --> 02:20:04.529
IT'S BIG IT'S NOT RECYCLABLE

02:20:04.596 --> 02:20:06.765
THERE'S NO WAY IN THE WORLD YOU

02:20:06.831 --> 02:20:07.398
CAN RECYCLE THAT NOBODY EVEN

02:20:07.465 --> 02:20:08.666
REALLY KNOWS WHAT'S IN THERE.

02:20:08.733 --> 02:20:10.402
AND THAT IS FILLING UP LANDFILLS

02:20:10.468 --> 02:20:11.402
ALL OVER NORTHERN CALIFORNIA

02:20:11.469 --> 02:20:12.837

02:20:15.707 --> 02:20:17.575
TO COME TO GRIPS WITH THAT

02:20:17.642 --> 02:20:18.376
REALITY. BUT I'M JUST CONCERNED

02:20:18.443 --> 02:20:20.378
ABOUT. HOW DIFFICULT IT ALREADY

02:20:20.445 --> 02:20:23.915
IS TO CITE- LANDFILL- AND NOW.

02:20:23.982 --> 02:20:26.351
GIVING ANOTHER AT AN AGENCY MORE

02:20:26.417 --> 02:20:28.653

02:20:28.720 --> 02:20:29.587
THAT MORE DIFFICULT AT SOME

02:20:29.654 --> 02:20:30.822
POINT. YOU KNOW WE CAN'T JUST

02:20:30.889 --> 02:20:33.925
LEAVE THIS OUT THERE- AND THAT'S

02:20:33.992 --> 02:20:34.826
THAT'S HUGE PROBLEM FROM MY

02:20:34.893 --> 02:20:36.594
PERSPECTIVE. AND I APPRECIATE IT

02:20:49.707 --> 02:20:51.142
