WHEN THE FIRES WERE MITIGATED

00:45:29.193 --> 00:45:32.096 region:rollup2
IN ANY A CONTAINMENT STATE. BUT

00:45:31.262 --> 00:45:34.765 region:rollup2
UNFORTUNATELY.

00:45:32.096 --> 00:45:36.867 region:rollup2
WE EXPERIENCED ANOTHER EVENT.

00:45:34.765 --> 00:45:39.070 region:rollup2
AS WE APPROACH THE FIRST OF

00:45:43.074 --> 00:45:47.478 region:rollup2
MUD FLOW AND DEBRIS FLOWS.

00:45:45.943 --> 00:45:49.714 region:rollup2
BUT THAT WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO DO

00:45:47.478 --> 00:45:51.816 region:rollup2
SPECIFIC TO THOSE MUD FLOWS IS A

00:45:49.714 --> 00:45:53.317 region:rollup2

COURSE OF ONLY TWO DAYS.

00:46:10.067 --> 00:46:12.870 region:rollup2
THE LACK OF VEGETATION ALLOWED

00:46:12.370 --> 00:46:15.473 region:rollup2
THESE INCREASED RATES OF

00:46:12.870 --> 00:46:16.874 region:rollup2
EROSION.

00:46:15.473 --> 00:46:18.175 region:rollup2

THIS TRAGIC DEBRIS FLOW RESULTED

00:48:02.179 --> 00:48:05.149 region:rollup2
IN TWENTY THREE FOR TALENT IS IN

00:48:12.490 --> 00:48:15.626 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF THIS PRE POSITIONING

00:48:13.991 --> 00:48:17.628 region:rollup2

TWENTY FOUR HOURS AT THE EVENT.

00:48:21.632 --> 00:48:24.468 region:rollup2
IT'S UNLIKELY THAT THIS WOULD

00:48:22.933 --> 00:48:27.304 region:rollup2
HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE WITHOUT THAT

00:48:24.468 --> 00:48:29.306 region:rollup2
PRE POSITIONING.

00:48:27.304 --> 00:48:31.242 region:rollup2
EVERYONE THEY CAME TO ASSIST

00:48:29.306 --> 00:48:31.976 region:rollup2
BEFORE THE DEBRIS FLOW CAME

00:48:31.242 --> 00:48:33.711 region:rollup2
UNDER THE MASTER MUTUAL AID

00:48:31.976 --> 00:48:34.945 region:rollup2

REIMBURSEMENT.

00:48:40.885 --> 00:48:44.321 region:rollup2
DEBRIS FLOWS IN MONTICELLO AND

00:48:42.586 --> 00:48:46.357 region:rollup2

REGROWSAND REPAIRS ITSELF.

00:48:51.095 --> 00:48:55.499 region:rollup2
AND SO WE ANTICIPATE HAVING TO

00:48:53.264 --> 00:48:57.501 region:rollup2
DO THIS OVER AND OVER AGAIN IN

00:48:55.499 --> 00:48:59.537 region:rollup2
OUR COMMUNITY.

00:48:57.501 --> 00:49:00.905 region:rollup2
MASTER MUTUAL AID IS MOST LIKELY

00:48:59.537 --> 00:49:03.007 region:rollup2
NOT ASSISTING NOBLE WAY TO DO

00:49:00.905 --> 00:49:04.074 region:rollup2
THIS.

00:49:03.007 --> 00:49:06.811 region:rollup2
SO THE ONE HUNDRED MILLION

00:49:04.074 --> 00:49:08.679 region:rollup2
DOLLAR ALLOCATION REQUESTED.

00:49:06.811 --> 00:49:11.148 region:rollup2

SAFE AND SAFER COMMUNITIES

00:49:11.148 --> 00:49:15.286 region:rollup2

FOR WILDLAND URBAN INTERFACE

00:49:25.029 --> 00:49:28.766 region:rollup2
FIRES.

00:49:27.698 --> 00:49:30.901 region:rollup2
NOW MOVING ON TO THE

00:49:28.766 --> 00:49:32.236 region:rollup2
COMMUNICATION NETWORKS.

00:49:30.901 --> 00:49:34.705 region:rollup2
THERE WERE UTILIZED IN EMERGENCY

00:49:32.236 --> 00:49:36.240 region:rollup2
RESPONSE THE FIRST NOT PROGRAM.

00:49:34.705 --> 00:49:38.142 region:rollup2
WILL PROVIDE ABOUT A THOUSAND

00:49:36.240 --> 00:49:39.977 region:rollup2
CELLULAR SITES IN THE FIRST FIVE

00:49:38.142 --> 00:49:41.412 region:rollup2
YEARS OF OPERATION.

00:49:39.977 --> 00:49:43.147 region:rollup2
WHICH WILL PROVIDE US WITH

00:49:41.412 --> 00:49:44.748 region:rollup2
FASTER CONNECTIONS AND MORE

00:49:43.147 --> 00:49:47.451 region:rollup2
BANDWIDTH IN THE PUBLIC SAFETY.

00:49:44.748 --> 00:49:49.553 region:rollup2
SPECTRUM.

00:49:47.451 --> 00:49:51.255 region:rollup2
THE IMPORTANCE OF BAND WITH US

00:49:49.553 --> 00:49:52.723 region:rollup2
IS IT IMPROVES OUR SITUATIONAL

00:49:51.255 --> 00:49:54.725 region:rollup2
AWARENESS.

00:49:52.723 --> 00:49:57.595 region:rollup2
ALLOWING US TO DEVELOP A COMMON

00:49:54.725 --> 00:50:00.030 region:rollup2
OPERATING PICTURE AND ULTIMATELY

00:49:57.595 --> 00:50:01.866 region:rollup2
BECOME INTER OPERABLE.

00:50:00.030 --> 00:50:04.902 region:rollup2
THIS STARTS IN A DEBRIS FLOW

00:50:01.866 --> 00:50:06.637 region:rollup2
EVENT WITH THE WEATHER FORECAST.

00:50:04.902 --> 00:50:08.572 region:rollup2
A LOT OF DECISIONS ARE MADE IN

00:50:06.637 --> 00:50:09.940 region:rollup2
ADVANCE OF THE EMERGENCY BASED

00:50:08.572 --> 00:50:12.376 region:rollup2
UPON WHAT THE NATIONAL WEATHER

00:50:09.940 --> 00:50:15.846 region:rollup2
SERVICE IS FORECASTING.

00:50:12.376 --> 00:50:17.748 region:rollup2
SPECIFICALLY THE RAIN INTENSITY.

00:50:15.846 --> 00:50:19.416 region:rollup2
THIS SYSTEM WILL ALSO HELP OUR

00:50:17.748 --> 00:50:20.918 region:rollup2
LOCAL SHERIFF'S OFFICE ON LAW

00:50:19.416 --> 00:50:22.353 region:rollup2
ENFORCEMENT WITH EVACUATION

00:50:20.918 --> 00:50:25.256 region:rollup2
TRACKING.

00:50:22.353 --> 00:50:26.724 region:rollup2
EVACUATION COMPLIANCE.

00:50:25.256 --> 00:50:28.392 region:rollup2
AND MAY POTENTIALLY ALERT

00:50:26.724 --> 00:50:30.027 region:rollup2
RESCUERS WHERE THEY NEED TO

00:50:28.392 --> 00:50:31.929 region:rollup2
FOCUS THEIR EFFORTS IF A DEGREE

00:50:30.027 --> 00:50:33.297 region:rollup2
FOR WORKERS.

00:50:31.929 --> 00:50:35.566 region:rollup2
IT COULD ALSO POTENTIALLY CREATE

00:50:33.297 --> 00:50:37.635 region:rollup2
A SITUATION WHERE EVACUEES COULD

00:50:35.566 --> 00:50:40.571 region:rollup2
SELF REPORT THEIR LOCATION TO

00:50:37.635 --> 00:50:42.673 region:rollup2
EMERGENCY RESPONDERS.

00:50:40.571 --> 00:50:44.842 region:rollup2
IT WOULD ALLOW US TO LEARN THE

00:50:42.673 --> 00:50:47.011 region:rollup2
DEBRIS BASIN STATUS

00:50:44.842 --> 00:50:48.078 region:rollup2
AT THE TIME OF THE ACTUAL EVENT

00:50:47.011 --> 00:50:49.947 region:rollup2
WITH LITTLE OR NO RISK TO

00:50:48.078 --> 00:50:51.448 region:rollup2
RESPONDERS.

00:50:49.947 --> 00:50:53.317 region:rollup2
TODAY THAT REQUIRES A HUMAN TO

00:50:51.448 --> 00:50:55.419 region:rollup2
WALK UP THERE AND TAKE A LOOK

00:50:53.317 --> 00:50:57.021 region:rollup2
AND SEE WHAT THE STATUS IS.

00:50:55.419 --> 00:50:59.056 region:rollup2
AND IT WOULD ALSO HELP US WITH

00:50:57.021 --> 00:51:00.457 region:rollup2
OUR POLICEMEN AIRY DEBRIS FLOW

00:50:59.056 --> 00:51:01.492 region:rollup2
DAMAGE ASSESSMENT.

00:51:00.457 --> 00:51:03.494 region:rollup2
THIS WOULD ALLOW US TO MORE

00:51:01.492 --> 00:51:05.462 region:rollup2
ACCURATELY FOCUS OUR SEARCH AND

00:51:03.494 --> 00:51:06.397 region:rollup2
RESCUE EFFORTS ON THOSE AREAS

00:51:05.462 --> 00:51:07.498 region:rollup2
WHERE WE BELIEVE THAT PEOPLE ARE

00:51:06.397 --> 00:51:09.300 region:rollup2
TRAPPED.

00:51:07.498 --> 00:51:11.702 region:rollup2
AS OPPOSED TO THOSE AREAS WHERE

00:51:09.300 --> 00:51:12.836 region:rollup2
THEY WOULD NOT BE.

00:51:11.702 --> 00:51:14.371 region:rollup2
IT WOULD PROVIDE IMMEDIATE

00:51:12.836 --> 00:51:16.173 region:rollup2
INFORMATION SHARING WITH THE

00:51:14.371 --> 00:51:17.708 region:rollup2
EMERGENCY OPERATIONS CENTER

00:51:16.173 --> 00:51:19.843 region:rollup2
WHICH SHOULD WE JEWS ARE REFLEX

00:51:17.708 --> 00:51:21.478 region:rollup2
TIME. AND IMPROVE THEIR ABILITY

00:51:19.843 --> 00:51:23.314 region:rollup2
TO SUPPORT AND COORDINATE THE

00:51:21.478 --> 00:51:24.315 region:rollup2
RESPONSE ON THE GROUND.

00:51:23.314 --> 00:51:26.183 region:rollup2
AND THEN FINALLY THESE

00:51:24.315 --> 00:51:28.352 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGIES WOULD ALLOW US TO

00:51:26.183 --> 00:51:29.420 region:rollup2
USE BOTH VIDEO AND FORWARD

00:51:28.352 --> 00:51:31.689 region:rollup2

TECHNOLOGY.

00:51:31.689 --> 00:51:35.192 region:rollup2
TO MORE CLEARLY DEFINE THE

00:51:33.057 --> 00:51:36.927 region:rollup2
CURRENT SITUATION.

00:51:35.192 --> 00:51:39.897 region:rollup2
THE SYSTEM CREATES RESILIENCY

00:51:36.927 --> 00:51:41.265 region:rollup2
AND REDUNDANCY.

00:51:39.897 --> 00:51:43.200 region:rollup2
AND MAY ALSO HELP SOLVE THE

00:51:41.265 --> 00:51:45.602 region:rollup2

SEVERAL MONTHS AGO.

00:51:51.475 --> 00:51:55.045 region:rollup2
THIS IS WHERE THE EMERGENCY CALL

00:51:53.544 --> 00:51:56.180 region:rollup2
FROM THE CELLPHONE DOESN'T

00:51:55.045 --> 00:51:57.514 region:rollup2

00:52:05.956 --> 00:52:09.793 region:rollup2
SO IN CLOSING I'D LIKE TO STATE

00:52:08.225 --> 00:52:12.229 region:rollup2
THAT PRE POSITIONING RESOURCES

00:52:09.793 --> 00:52:14.031 region:rollup2
WAS CRITICAL TO OUR SUCCESS IN

00:52:12.229 --> 00:52:15.532 region:rollup2
THE ONE NINE DEBRIS FLOW EVENT.

00:52:14.031 --> 00:52:16.700 region:rollup2

00:53:43.954 --> 00:53:48.392 region:rollup2
TIERED REALLY REALLY EFFECTIVE.

00:53:46.623 --> 00:53:50.160 region:rollup2
A NOTIFICATION SYSTEM WE USE FOR

00:53:48.392 --> 00:53:52.096 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT ELEMENTS THE FIRST ONE

00:53:50.160 --> 00:53:53.530 region:rollup2
IS THE SYSTEM WE CALL VC ALERT

00:53:52.096 --> 00:53:55.199 region:rollup2
WHICH IS A THIRD PARTY VENDOR

00:53:53.530 --> 00:53:57.201 region:rollup2
CALLED EVER BRIDGE. DURING THE

00:53:55.199 --> 00:53:58.335 region:rollup2
THOMAS FAR WE MADE NOTIFICATIONS

RATE.

00:54:03.707 --> 00:54:07.578 region:rollup2
NOW THAT SOUNDS REALLY GOOD THIS

00:54:05.943 --> 00:54:09.113 region:rollup2
IS A SYSTEM THAT PEOPLE GO IN

00:54:07.578 --> 00:54:10.314 region:rollup2
AND SIGN UP FOR THEMSELVES.

00:54:09.113 --> 00:54:12.116 region:rollup2
SOME SOME COUNTIES CALLED

00:54:10.314 --> 00:54:13.650 region:rollup2
REVERSE NINE ONE ONE SOME DON'T

00:54:12.116 --> 00:54:15.419 region:rollup2
HAVE ANY SYSTEM BUT IT'S THERE

00:54:13.650 --> 00:54:17.221 region:rollup2
THE PROBLEM AS YOU NEED PEOPLE

00:54:15.419 --> 00:54:18.722 region:rollup2
TO GO SIGN UP FOR IT. SO IN MY

00:54:17.221 --> 00:54:20.290 region:rollup2
COUNTY I'VE SIXTY THOUSAND

I BY THE NINE ONE ONE DATA.

00:54:25.262 --> 00:54:28.799 region:rollup2
WHICH GIVES ME ANOTHER COUPLE

00:54:26.697 --> 00:54:29.366 region:rollup2
HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE OF DATA.

00:54:28.799 --> 00:54:31.001 region:rollup2
HOW MANY OF YOU ANSWER YOUR

00:54:31.001 --> 00:54:33.403 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHAT NINE ONE ONE DATA

00:54:31.602 --> 00:54:35.672 region:rollup2
IS.

00:54:33.403 --> 00:54:38.041 region:rollup2
SO. WHAT WOULD BE INCREDIBLY

00:54:35.672 --> 00:54:39.576 region:rollup2
HELPFUL AND WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO

00:54:38.041 --> 00:54:41.712 region:rollup2
WORK WITH CELL PHONE PROVIDERS

00:54:39.576 --> 00:54:43.747 region:rollup2
IF WE GET ACCESS TO CELL PHONE

00:54:41.712 --> 00:54:44.882 region:rollup2
DATA GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION?

00:54:43.747 --> 00:54:45.816 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT DOESN'T DO ME ANY

00:54:44.882 --> 00:54:47.451 region:rollup2
GOOD TO HAVE YOUR CELL PHONE

00:54:45.816 --> 00:54:48.719 region:rollup2

00:54:47.451 --> 00:54:50.053 region:rollup2
ADDRESS.

00:54:48.719 --> 00:54:52.322 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OUR SURGICAL SURGED

GEOGRAPHIC NOTIFICATION.

00:55:00.297 --> 00:55:02.699 region:rollup2
AND THAT IS REALLY REALLY

00:55:01.365 --> 00:55:04.468 region:rollup2
CRITICAL WHETHER IT BE AN ACTIVE

00:55:02.699 --> 00:55:06.737 region:rollup2
SHOOTER. WHETHER IT BE AN

00:55:04.468 --> 00:55:09.139 region:rollup2
EXPLOSION A CHEMICAL EXPLOSION

00:55:06.737 --> 00:55:10.007 region:rollup2
WHETHER BE A FIRE WE DON'T HAVE

00:55:09.139 --> 00:55:11.275 region:rollup2
TO USE THE WIDE AREA NETWORK

00:55:10.007 --> 00:55:13.443 region:rollup2
SYSTEM.

00:55:11.275 --> 00:55:15.145 region:rollup2
SO AS A FOLLOW UP TO OUR LOCAL

00:55:13.443 --> 00:55:17.047 region:rollup2
AREA NOTIFICATION DURING THE

BE PREACHING THE CHORUS YOU KNOW

00:55:24.988 --> 00:55:27.658 region:rollup2

TOWER.

00:55:30.294 --> 00:55:34.198 region:rollup2
SO THEY COVER THE AREA THAT WE

00:55:32.196 --> 00:55:35.933 region:rollup2
WANT BUT THEY ALSO COVER A

00:55:34.198 --> 00:55:37.434 region:rollup2
BROADER SPECTRUM.

00:55:35.933 --> 00:55:39.203 region:rollup2

HOME PHONES WE HOPE THERE'S A

00:57:40.590 --> 00:57:43.260 region:rollup2
WAY TO WORK AROUND THAT.

00:57:42.159 --> 00:57:44.628 region:rollup2
THE OTHER ISSUE WHICH THE F.

PEOPLE ON THAT NOTIFICATION

00:58:49.259 --> 00:58:53.296 region:rollup2
SYSTEM RATHER THAN PEOPLE HAVE

00:58:51.361 --> 00:58:55.098 region:rollup2
TO FIRST KNOW THAT THE SYSTEM

00:58:53.296 --> 00:58:57.367 region:rollup2
EXISTS THEN TAKE THE AFFIRMATIVE

00:58:55.098 --> 00:58:59.002 region:rollup2
STEP TO OPT IN. THEMSELVES THIS

00:58:57.367 --> 00:59:00.804 region:rollup2
WAY WE KNOW AS YOU'VE INDICATED

00:58:59.002 --> 00:59:02.572 region:rollup2
IT WILL SAVE LIVES SO I

BEEN.

00:59:06.576 --> 00:59:07.778 region:rollup2
BUT.

00:59:06.777 --> 00:59:08.979 region:rollup2
.

00:59:07.778 --> 00:59:11.481 region:rollup2
PERHAPS WE WERE CHANNELING THAT

00:59:08.979 --> 00:59:13.450 region:rollup2
THE IDF AS A RESULT THE LAST

00:59:11.481 --> 00:59:14.985 region:rollup2
HEARING I DID HAVE A COUPLE

00:59:13.450 --> 00:59:17.587 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS IF I COULD FOR.

00:59:14.985 --> 00:59:21.491 region:rollup2
DEPUTY TIE A TYLER.

00:59:17.587 --> 00:59:23.393 region:rollup2
YOU MENTIONED THAT YOU PUT TO.

00:59:21.491 --> 00:59:24.761 region:rollup2
A HUNDRED.

00:59:23.393 --> 00:59:26.196 region:rollup2
IT WAS SHIPPED ONE POINT THREE

00:59:24.761 --> 00:59:27.564 region:rollup2
MILLION GALLONS OF FIRE

00:59:26.196 --> 00:59:29.566 region:rollup2
RETARDANT.

00:59:27.564 --> 00:59:31.802 region:rollup2
I SAW SOME OF THAT.

00:59:29.566 --> 00:59:34.004 region:rollup2
OF ITS KIND OF PINK.

00:59:31.802 --> 00:59:36.773 region:rollup2
IT LOOKS REALLY WEIRD ON TREES

00:59:34.004 --> 00:59:38.742 region:rollup2
BUT I KNOW THAT IT DID HELP SAVE

00:59:36.773 --> 00:59:40.010 region:rollup2
A LOT OF I AM CURIOUS FROM

00:59:38.742 --> 00:59:41.178 region:rollup2
BURNING UP PARTICULARLY IN THE.

00:59:47.317 --> 00:59:50.120 region:rollup2
WHAT THE ENVIRONMENTAL

00:59:48.518 --> 00:59:52.923 region:rollup2
IMPLICATIONS ARE IS THE SOFT

00:59:50.120 --> 00:59:55.125 region:rollup2
TOXIC. AS IT SORT OF SWEPT DOWN

00:59:52.923 --> 00:59:57.494 region:rollup2
THE THE HILLSIDES WITH THE THE.

00:59:55.125 --> 00:59:59.529 region:rollup2
WOULD WE CALL THAT OF MUCH LIKE

00:59:57.494 --> 01:00:00.664 region:rollup2
WE CALLED THE WITH NINE THE ONE

00:59:59.529 --> 01:00:02.299 region:rollup2
NINE.

01:00:00.664 --> 01:00:04.534 region:rollup2
MY DEBRIS INCIDENT WERE TRYING

01:00:02.299 --> 01:00:07.170 region:rollup2
TO READ THAT REPURPOSE THE NAME

01:00:04.534 --> 01:00:09.473 region:rollup2
SO. OF THE IT'S.

01:00:07.170 --> 01:00:10.907 region:rollup2
ONE THAT DOESN'T COME EASILY TO

01:00:09.473 --> 01:00:12.242 region:rollup2
MY LIPS SO.

01:00:10.907 --> 01:00:13.677 region:rollup2
CHIEF TYLER WHAT WHAT TAYLOR

01:00:12.242 --> 01:00:16.246 region:rollup2
WHAT WE CALL THIS THE MONEY ONE

01:00:13.677 --> 01:00:17.781 region:rollup2
NINE DEBRIS FLOW ONE NINE TO

01:00:16.246 --> 01:00:19.983 region:rollup2
REFILL THAT'S THAT MUCH

01:00:17.781 --> 01:00:20.450 region:rollup2
MUDSLIDES AND MOAN SEAT WANTING

01:00:19.983 --> 01:00:21.751 region:rollup2
TO BRIEF.

01:00:20.450 --> 01:00:23.587 region:rollup2
WHAT WHAT IS THAT MEAN IN TERMS

01:00:21.751 --> 01:00:23.887 region:rollup2
OF IN THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS

01:00:23.587 --> 01:00:25.055 region:rollup2
OF OF THAT?

01:00:23.887 --> 01:00:27.190 region:rollup2
?

01:00:25.055 --> 01:00:29.392 region:rollup2
FIRE RETARDANT BEING IN THE.

01:00:27.190 --> 01:00:31.328 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY.

01:00:29.392 --> 01:00:31.928 region:rollup2
SO CSUS SPECIFICALLY AT THERE

01:00:31.328 --> 01:00:33.163 region:rollup2
WERE A LOT OF QUESTIONS CAME

01:00:31.928 --> 01:00:33.997 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE AMOUNT OF FIRE

01:00:33.163 --> 01:00:35.065 region:rollup2
RETARDANTS BOTH THE NORTHERN

01:00:33.997 --> 01:00:36.700 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA AND SO THE SOUTHERN

01:00:35.065 --> 01:00:37.567 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA THAT WERE. WERE

01:00:36.700 --> 01:00:39.536 region:rollup2
DROPPED.

01:00:37.567 --> 01:00:40.937 region:rollup2
LET ME ASSURE YOU THAT A SECRET

01:00:39.536 --> 01:00:42.539 region:rollup2
DOCUMENTS A LOT OF ANALYSIS HAS

01:00:40.937 --> 01:00:44.207 region:rollup2
BEEN DONE ON FIRE RETARDANT AND

01:00:42.539 --> 01:00:45.008 region:rollup2
THERE IS CONCERN.

01:00:44.207 --> 01:00:46.176 region:rollup2
.

01:00:45.008 --> 01:00:47.878 region:rollup2
BROADLY OF BY DIFFERENT

01:00:46.176 --> 01:00:49.513 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATIONS ABOUT TO ITS

01:00:47.878 --> 01:00:51.214 region:rollup2
CHEMICAL COMPONENTS AND WHAT IT

01:00:49.513 --> 01:00:52.849 region:rollup2
MIGHT DO TO THE ENVIRONMENT. UP

01:00:51.214 --> 01:00:54.985 region:rollup2
THERE IS A SPECIFIC.

01:00:52.849 --> 01:00:56.286 region:rollup2
INTER AGENCY AIR TAKE IMPORTANT

01:00:54.985 --> 01:00:58.255 region:rollup2
FAR CHEMICALS.

01:00:56.286 --> 01:00:59.756 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATIONS WHO FOR SERVICE

01:00:58.255 --> 01:01:02.192 region:rollup2
THE CAL FIRE TAKES PART IN IN.

01:00:59.756 --> 01:01:03.426 region:rollup2
MISSOULA MONTANA THAT EVALUATES

01:01:02.192 --> 01:01:05.295 region:rollup2
FAR CHEMICALS AND THEY ALSO

01:01:03.426 --> 01:01:06.830 region:rollup2
EVALUATE THEM FOR THEIR TOXICITY

01:01:05.295 --> 01:01:08.031 region:rollup2
TO THE COMMUNITIES AND THE

01:01:06.830 --> 01:01:10.100 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENT.

01:01:08.031 --> 01:01:11.768 region:rollup2
BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY A FIRE

01:01:10.100 --> 01:01:15.772 region:rollup2
RETARDANT FOR THE MOST PART IS

01:01:11.768 --> 01:01:17.007 region:rollup2
MADE UP. A PRIMARILY OF WATER

01:01:15.772 --> 01:01:19.409 region:rollup2
WITH EIGHT GUMMING AGENT AND

01:01:17.007 --> 01:01:21.244 region:rollup2
APPROXIMATELY ELEVEN PERCENT.

01:01:19.409 --> 01:01:22.646 region:rollup2
NITROGEN COMPONENT THAT YOU

01:01:21.244 --> 01:01:25.215 region:rollup2
WOULD FIND IN A NORMAL LAWN

01:01:22.646 --> 01:01:26.583 region:rollup2
FERTILIZER. HAS A GUMMING AGENT

01:01:25.215 --> 01:01:27.484 region:rollup2
THAT'S INCLUDED WITHIN THAT

01:01:26.583 --> 01:01:29.352 region:rollup2
FERTILIZER.

01:01:27.484 --> 01:01:30.554 region:rollup2
WITHIN THAT WITH THAT IN THAT

01:01:29.352 --> 01:01:34.991 region:rollup2
RETARDANT.

01:01:30.554 --> 01:01:36.927 region:rollup2
AND IT HAS THAT RED DYE IN IT.

01:01:34.991 --> 01:01:38.995 region:rollup2
NOT BECAUSE THAT IS THE MAKE UP

01:01:36.927 --> 01:01:40.864 region:rollup2
OF THE RETARDANT ITSELF BUT THE

01:01:38.995 --> 01:01:41.665 region:rollup2
PRIMARY REASON FOR THE RED DYE

01:01:40.864 --> 01:01:43.200 region:rollup2
IS SO.

01:01:41.665 --> 01:01:43.733 region:rollup2
THE AIR TACTICAL GROUP

01:01:43.200 --> 01:01:45.735 region:rollup2
SUPERVISOR THE AIR TANKER

01:01:43.733 --> 01:01:46.603 region:rollup2
PILOTS.

01:01:45.735 --> 01:01:49.105 region:rollup2
AND THE.

01:01:46.603 --> 01:01:50.607 region:rollup2
AND THE HELICOPTER PILOTS CAN

01:01:49.105 --> 01:01:51.474 region:rollup2
SEE WHERE THEY HAVE DROPPED THE

01:01:50.607 --> 01:01:53.944 region:rollup2
RETARDANT.

01:01:51.474 --> 01:01:55.879 region:rollup2
WHILE THEY'RE FLYING IN THE AIR.

01:01:53.944 --> 01:01:57.847 region:rollup2
AGAIN MADE UP OF APPROXIMATELY

01:01:55.879 --> 01:01:58.915 region:rollup2
ELEVEN PERCENT. OF NITROGEN

01:01:57.847 --> 01:02:00.483 region:rollup2
AGAIN THE SAME CALLED CHEMICAL

01:01:58.915 --> 01:02:01.451 region:rollup2
COMPOUNDS THAT YOU SEE AND

01:02:00.483 --> 01:02:04.354 region:rollup2
FERTILIZER.

01:02:01.451 --> 01:02:06.523 region:rollup2
AND WE HAVE FOUND.

01:02:04.354 --> 01:02:08.892 region:rollup2
HISTORICALLY THAT.

01:02:06.523 --> 01:02:11.661 region:rollup2
THROUGH DILUTION OR OTHERWISE

01:02:08.892 --> 01:02:13.196 region:rollup2
THEREIN NO CHEMICAL ILL EFFECTS

01:02:11.661 --> 01:02:16.132 region:rollup2
OF FIRE RETARDANT.

01:02:13.196 --> 01:02:17.434 region:rollup2
TO COMMUNITIES.

01:02:16.132 --> 01:02:18.868 region:rollup2
I'M SURE SOME OF MY

01:02:17.434 --> 01:02:20.604 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENTAL FRIENDS WOULD HAVE

01:02:18.868 --> 01:02:21.671 region:rollup2
A RESPONSE BUT I'LL BE SURE THAT

.

01:02:27.611 --> 01:02:31.214 region:rollup2
DID ANY OF OUR FIRST RESPONDERS

01:02:29.479 --> 01:02:33.149 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCE ANY INTER OPERABILITY

IN SOME AREAS WHEN THEY HAVE.

01:08:45.488 --> 01:08:47.824 region:rollup2
STRONG WINDS OF FIRES SPECIAL

01:08:47.256 --> 01:08:49.158 region:rollup2
DOWN SOUTH BUT WE DON'T DO

01:08:47.824 --> 01:08:50.860 region:rollup2
APPEAR THAT'S ONE THING THAT NOW

01:08:49.158 --> 01:08:52.895 region:rollup2
WE'RE GOOD AT IS INCONSISTENCY

01:08:50.860 --> 01:08:54.197 region:rollup2
NOT I'M TALKING EVERYONE THE

01:08:52.895 --> 01:08:56.032 region:rollup2
ENTIRE SYSTEM. WERE STATE WHAT

01:08:54.197 --> 01:08:58.868 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE FOR A CUP POWER OFF

01:08:56.032 --> 01:08:59.402 region:rollup2
WHICH YOU LIVE HAVE HIGHWAYS

01:08:58.868 --> 01:08:59.969 region:rollup2
THAT SHOULD BE A STELLAR

01:08:59.402 --> 01:09:01.204 region:rollup2
EVERYWHERE. THAT'S SOMETHING

01:08:59.969 --> 01:09:02.872 region:rollup2
THAT WE CAN LOOK AT BECAUSE

01:09:01.204 --> 01:09:04.374 region:rollup2
YOU'RE TOO OFTEN HEAR THINGS

01:09:02.872 --> 01:09:06.109 region:rollup2
AFTER THE FACT IN NORTHERN

01:09:04.374 --> 01:09:08.645 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA WE DON'T DO THAT. P.

01:09:06.109 --> 01:09:09.912 region:rollup2
JESUS AND DO APPEAR IN IT WE

POSSIBLY IN PLANO TACTICS.

01:09:11.547 --> 01:09:15.485 region:rollup2
WALLET WOODS INTERVIEWS TO

01:09:12.415 --> 01:09:16.386 region:rollup2
CONSUMERS OBVIOUSLY IT DIFLUCAN

01:09:15.485 --> 01:09:17.153 region:rollup2
SAVE LIVES.

01:09:16.386 --> 01:09:17.820 region:rollup2
SO THERE IS YOUR THOUGHT ABOUT

01:09:17.153 --> 01:09:19.856 region:rollup2
DOING THAT AND MAYBE A STATEWIDE

01:09:17.820 --> 01:09:20.723 region:rollup2
POLICY.

01:09:19.856 --> 01:09:24.293 region:rollup2

WE WE TALK ABOUT.

01:09:25.061 --> 01:09:28.731 region:rollup2
LESSONS LEARNED THESE ARE ONE

01:09:26.162 --> 01:09:31.601 region:rollup2
OF THE LESSONS LEARNED THAT.

01:09:28.731 --> 01:09:32.902 region:rollup2
THAT WE ARE LOOKING AT IS

01:09:31.601 --> 01:09:33.603 region:rollup2
WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE CPU SEE

01:09:32.902 --> 01:09:35.238 region:rollup2
AS WELL AS THE.

01:09:33.603 --> 01:09:37.340 region:rollup2
UTILITIES.

01:09:35.238 --> 01:09:38.908 region:rollup2
ACROSS CALIFORNIA TO TRY TO.

01:09:37.340 --> 01:09:40.877 region:rollup2
EVALUATE THIS PROCESS IS AND

01:09:38.908 --> 01:09:42.478 region:rollup2
PERHAPS STANDARDIZE ACROSS

01:09:40.877 --> 01:09:43.846 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA. I GUESS MY QUESTION

01:09:42.478 --> 01:09:44.647 region:rollup2
WOULD BE IS HOW LONG THEY'VE

01:09:43.846 --> 01:09:45.181 region:rollup2
BEEN CUT SO I'VE JUST HEARD

01:09:44.647 --> 01:09:47.483 region:rollup2
ABOUT IT AS A RESULT THESE

01:09:45.181 --> 01:09:48.651 region:rollup2
FIRES.

01:09:47.483 --> 01:09:50.119 region:rollup2
SO HOW LONG THEY'VE BEEN CUTTING

01:09:48.651 --> 01:09:52.455 region:rollup2
OUT THE POWER DOWN SOUTH.

01:09:50.119 --> 01:09:55.425 region:rollup2
IT'S BEEN GOING ON FOR YEARS.

01:09:52.455 --> 01:09:56.059 region:rollup2
I DON'T KNOW THAT ANSWER.

01:09:55.425 --> 01:09:57.694 region:rollup2
I WOULD HAVE TO GET BACK TO YOU

01:09:56.059 --> 01:09:59.128 region:rollup2
ON THAT.

01:09:57.694 --> 01:10:02.265 region:rollup2
ASSUMING RECORDS I JUST HAVING

01:09:59.128 --> 01:10:04.534 region:rollup2
LIVE THERE IT'S.

01:10:02.265 --> 01:10:05.435 region:rollup2
GENERALLY DRIVEN BY AN INCIDENT

01:10:04.534 --> 01:10:08.538 region:rollup2
AND POST INCIDENT AND POST

01:10:05.435 --> 01:10:10.273 region:rollup2
INCIDENT LITIGATION.

01:10:08.538 --> 01:10:11.207 region:rollup2
SO AFTER THE THOMAS FIRE I THINK

01:10:10.273 --> 01:10:12.742 region:rollup2
THEY. YOU KNOW EDISON COULD SAY

01:10:11.207 --> 01:10:15.044 region:rollup2

01:10:12.742 --> 01:10:15.611 region:rollup2
OUR POWER THREE DIFFERENT TIMES

01:10:15.044 --> 01:10:17.814 region:rollup2
A BEFORE THAT I CAN REMEMBER

01:10:15.611 --> 01:10:19.582 region:rollup2
WHEN.

01:10:17.814 --> 01:10:20.249 region:rollup2
THAT'S GREAT I MEAN WE SHOULD DO

01:10:19.582 --> 01:10:22.552 region:rollup2
IT I THINK SHOULD BE SOMETIME A

01:10:20.249 --> 01:10:23.119 region:rollup2
STANDARD. THAT WE CAN A PLAYER

01:10:22.552 --> 01:10:27.390 region:rollup2
POSSIBLY TAKE A LOOK AT THAT

01:10:23.119 --> 01:10:29.125 region:rollup2

THESE FIRES HAVE IN NORTHERN

01:10:46.909 --> 01:10:49.412 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA WE'VE LEARNED

01:13:57.633 --> 01:14:00.770 region:rollup2
CULTURE AND HOW THEY DO IT AND I

01:13:59.135 --> 01:14:02.872 region:rollup2
THINK LOCAL GOVERNMENT BODIES

01:14:00.770 --> 01:14:05.374 region:rollup2
SHOULD DICTATE THAT. USING THE

01:14:02.872 --> 01:14:07.543 region:rollup2
SAME NO NOMENCLATURE AS TO WHAT

01:14:05.374 --> 01:14:08.744 region:rollup2
IS IT IN A VOLUNTARY EVACUATION

01:14:07.543 --> 01:14:09.979 region:rollup2
RESIDENT ADVISORY.

01:14:08.744 --> 01:14:11.948 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY NEAR BORDERING

01:14:09.979 --> 01:14:13.749 region:rollup2
COUNTIES MIGHT BE HELPFUL AND

01:14:11.948 --> 01:14:16.118 region:rollup2
WHILE THEY'RE CERTAINLY BE SOME

01:14:13.749 --> 01:14:16.652 region:rollup2
DISCUSSION AMONGST ALL THE THE

01:14:16.118 --> 01:14:18.254 region:rollup2
FIRST RESPONDERS AND THOSE

01:14:16.652 --> 01:14:20.056 region:rollup2
INVOLVED I THINK YOU COULD COME

01:14:18.254 --> 01:14:21.190 region:rollup2
TO SOME CONSENSUS SO AT LEAST

01:14:20.056 --> 01:14:22.658 region:rollup2
EVERYBODY WAS TALKING THE SAME

01:14:21.190 --> 01:14:23.759 region:rollup2
LANGUAGE. I DON'T THINK YOU'RE

01:14:22.658 --> 01:14:25.661 region:rollup2
EVER GONNA HAVE A CONSENSUS OR

01:14:23.759 --> 01:14:27.096 region:rollup2
THAT YOU SHOULD ON WHEN THE

01:14:25.661 --> 01:14:28.497 region:rollup2
NOTIFICATION SHOULD ACTUALLY GO

01:14:27.096 --> 01:14:30.232 region:rollup2
OUT.

01:14:28.497 --> 01:14:32.268 region:rollup2
MR GRUBER.

01:14:30.232 --> 01:14:33.736 region:rollup2
I SET MYSELF TO SOME RESEARCH IN

01:14:32.268 --> 01:14:35.371 region:rollup2
IT IT LOOKS LIKE THE FIRST DE

01:14:33.736 --> 01:14:36.472 region:rollup2
ENERGIZE POLLY BACK IN TWO

01:14:35.371 --> 01:14:38.507 region:rollup2
THOUSAND TWELVE.

01:14:36.472 --> 01:14:39.942 region:rollup2
WAS THE FIRST INCIDENT HERE WE

01:14:38.507 --> 01:14:41.610 region:rollup2
ARE SIX YEARS LATER IN EIGHTEEN

01:14:39.942 --> 01:14:42.712 region:rollup2
AND I GUESS. I DON'T WANT TO

01:14:41.610 --> 01:14:44.547 region:rollup2
WAIT FOR THE PC TO MAKE A

01:14:42.712 --> 01:14:46.816 region:rollup2
DECISION THAT MAYBE TWO YEARS

01:14:44.547 --> 01:14:47.383 region:rollup2
DOWN THE ROAD GOT A FIRE SEASON

01:14:46.816 --> 01:14:48.284 region:rollup2
COMING UP IT'S GONNA BE DRY

01:14:47.383 --> 01:14:50.186 region:rollup2
AGAIN.

01:14:48.284 --> 01:14:52.054 region:rollup2
SO THERE IS THE EMPHASIS TO ME

01:14:50.186 --> 01:14:53.656 region:rollup2
FOR SOME.

01:14:52.054 --> 01:14:54.123 region:rollup2
FIRST TO GET GOING ON THAT AND

01:14:53.656 --> 01:14:55.424 region:rollup2
AND MAKE IT A STANDARD

01:14:54.123 --> 01:14:57.259 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY.

01:14:55.424 --> 01:14:58.160 region:rollup2
EACH SCENARIOS DIFFERENT AND

01:14:57.259 --> 01:14:59.962 region:rollup2
DICTATES WHAT COULD HAPPEN AS

01:14:58.160 --> 01:15:02.598 region:rollup2
FAR AS I KNOW WHEN AND WHETHER

01:14:59.962 --> 01:15:03.165 region:rollup2
YOU MIDI FIRE SO.

01:15:02.598 --> 01:15:04.867 region:rollup2
TO ME THAT'S SOMETHING THAT

01:15:03.165 --> 01:15:06.102 region:rollup2
SHOULD HAPPEN.

01:15:04.867 --> 01:15:07.703 region:rollup2
SOONER THAN THE LATER KNOWN THE

01:15:06.102 --> 01:15:08.971 region:rollup2
WAY THE STATE GOVERNMENT WORKS

01:15:07.703 --> 01:15:10.506 region:rollup2
IT COULD BE TWO YEARS FROM NOW

01:15:08.971 --> 01:15:12.475 region:rollup2
FOR THE DECISION ON THAT SO SO

01:15:10.506 --> 01:15:15.177 region:rollup2
HOW DO WE GET THERE. WITH YOU

01:15:12.475 --> 01:15:16.445 region:rollup2
GUYS IN THE OF UTILITIES I USE

01:15:15.177 --> 01:15:17.980 region:rollup2
I TRY TO FIGURE OUT A SYSTEM

01:15:16.445 --> 01:15:19.048 region:rollup2
THAT WE CAN PLAY THIS SUMMER.

01:15:17.980 --> 01:15:20.783 region:rollup2
IF YOU SUB FIRES HAPPEN NORTHERN

01:15:19.048 --> 01:15:21.917 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA.

GIVING USERS UP HERE YET

01:15:21.917 --> 01:15:30.960 region:rollup2
HOW DO WE GET THERE THIS SUMMER.

TALK ABOUT THE LESSONS LEARNED A

01:15:49.078 --> 01:15:51.680 region:rollup2
LOT OF THOSE ITEMS ARE SO WE'RE

01:15:50.379 --> 01:15:53.949 region:rollup2
MEETING WITH THEM ON FRIDAY.

IN THEIR ACTIONS AND THAT'S JUST

01:16:03.926 --> 01:16:07.763 region:rollup2

WHICH IS A FEW SHORT MONTHS AWAY

01:16:12.535 --> 01:16:15.304 region:rollup2
I WOULD SAY LET'S DO IT.

01:16:14.170 --> 01:16:17.139 region:rollup2
SOMEHOW SOME WAY THAT'S THAT'S

01:16:15.304 --> 01:16:18.374 region:rollup2

IF IF IT WANTS CONDITIONS AND I

01:16:18.374 --> 01:16:21.811 region:rollup2
THINK COMMANDERS THERE AND FEELS

BEST TO SHUT DOWN TO SAVE LIVES.

01:16:21.811 --> 01:16:26.048 region:rollup2
WE SHOULD DO IT.

OF THE NATURAL DISASTERS AND I

01:17:05.688 --> 01:17:08.457 region:rollup2
WOULD ECHO.

01:17:06.956 --> 01:17:10.793 region:rollup2
WHAT'S BEEN SAID THAT WE DID I

01:17:08.457 --> 01:17:12.161 region:rollup2
* DO WE DID IDENTIFY

01:17:10.793 --> 01:17:13.729 region:rollup2
IMMEDIATE PROBLEMS IN TERMS OF

01:17:12.161 --> 01:17:15.498 region:rollup2
THE COMMUNICATION. UP BUT THERE

01:17:13.729 --> 01:17:18.200 region:rollup2
WAS ALSO ANY MEDIA EFFORT TO

01:17:15.498 --> 01:17:18.767 region:rollup2
RECTIFY THE PROBLEMS AND TO COME

01:17:18.200 --> 01:17:23.372 region:rollup2
TO A SOLUTION I AND I THINK

01:17:18.767 --> 01:17:43.759 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:17:23.372 --> 01:17:43.759 region:rollup2
WHAT WE

01:17:55.871 --> 01:18:00.109 region:rollup2
ABOUT AND ON THE?

01:17:58.941 --> 01:18:01.544 region:rollup2
AND I ON THE FRIEND TO HAVE.

01:18:00.109 --> 01:18:03.078 region:rollup2
.

01:18:01.544 --> 01:18:04.914 region:rollup2
KIND OF MAKING A DECISION ABOUT.

01:18:03.078 --> 01:18:07.616 region:rollup2
A.

01:18:04.914 --> 01:18:09.218 region:rollup2
ABOUT OUR ENERGY SUPPLY AND AND

01:18:07.616 --> 01:18:10.452 region:rollup2
SO FORTH I I THINK I JUST WANT

01:18:09.218 --> 01:18:11.787 region:rollup2
TO NOTE THAT IT WAS.

01:18:10.452 --> 01:18:13.422 region:rollup2
.

01:18:11.787 --> 01:18:16.659 region:rollup2
ON THE FIRST NIGHT OF THE THOMAS

01:18:13.422 --> 01:18:17.826 region:rollup2
FIRE. AYE WHIZ AYE LIVE CASH HOW

01:18:16.659 --> 01:18:19.528 region:rollup2
MANY MILES IS IT FROM.

01:18:17.826 --> 01:18:20.329 region:rollup2
THE LEAD AFTER.

01:18:19.528 --> 01:18:22.698 region:rollup2
SENATE PAULA.

01:18:20.329 --> 01:18:24.667 region:rollup2
CDI.

01:18:22.698 --> 01:18:26.602 region:rollup2
SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND I WAS.

01:18:24.667 --> 01:18:28.771 region:rollup2
.

01:18:26.602 --> 01:18:30.439 region:rollup2
TWO AND I I THINK DIDN'T HAVE.

01:18:28.771 --> 01:18:32.908 region:rollup2
.

01:18:30.439 --> 01:18:34.476 region:rollup2
THE POWER FOR SIX HOURS AND SO

01:18:32.908 --> 01:18:36.011 region:rollup2
OUR ENTIRE HIGHER REGION.

01:18:34.476 --> 01:18:36.845 region:rollup2
AND AND YOU KNOW I WAS IN A

01:18:36.011 --> 01:18:37.513 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT COUNTY THAT OUR ENTIRE

01:18:36.845 --> 01:18:39.882 region:rollup2
REGION.

01:18:37.513 --> 01:18:41.884 region:rollup2
WAS DOWN IN TERMS OF POWER BUT

01:18:39.882 --> 01:18:42.985 region:rollup2
I ALSO REALIZE THAT.

01:18:41.884 --> 01:18:43.619 region:rollup2
FROM THE POINT OF THE

01:18:42.985 --> 01:18:46.322 region:rollup2
CONSTITUENTS.

01:18:43.619 --> 01:18:48.857 region:rollup2
.

01:18:46.322 --> 01:18:50.693 region:rollup2
EVEN EVEN NOTICE IT IS REALLY

01:18:48.857 --> 01:18:52.494 region:rollup2
HELPFUL BECAUSE THAT'S A LOT OF

01:18:50.693 --> 01:18:53.662 region:rollup2
IMPLICATIONS SO I KNOW THAT

01:18:52.494 --> 01:18:55.731 region:rollup2
THERE'S IMPLICATIONS RELATED TO

01:18:53.662 --> 01:18:57.733 region:rollup2
HEALTH PARTICULARLY THOSE.

01:18:55.731 --> 01:19:00.235 region:rollup2
WHO HAVE HEALTH ISSUES WHO NEED

01:18:57.733 --> 01:19:03.072 region:rollup2
SOME FORM OF POWER TO GET THEM

01:19:00.235 --> 01:19:05.007 region:rollup2
THROUGH EACH HOUR? ON AND I

01:19:03.072 --> 01:19:06.575 region:rollup2
DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S A WAY TO

01:19:05.007 --> 01:19:08.510 region:rollup2
PREPARE PEOPLE IN CASE OF AN

01:19:06.575 --> 01:19:10.245 region:rollup2
EMERGENCY WE MAY BE DOWN.

01:19:08.510 --> 01:19:12.915 region:rollup2
THE EXAMPLE REGRETTABLY THAT

01:19:10.245 --> 01:19:15.718 region:rollup2
COMES TO MIND OVER AND OVER WAS.

01:19:12.915 --> 01:19:17.519 region:rollup2
AND WHEN AT ONE POINT WE THOUGHT

01:19:15.718 --> 01:19:19.455 region:rollup2
WE MIGHT BE SIX DAYS AND THAT

01:19:17.519 --> 01:19:21.123 region:rollup2
WAS WHAT WE WERE MESSAGING TO

01:19:19.455 --> 01:19:21.757 region:rollup2
THE PUBLIC AND THE ANGST AROUND

01:19:21.123 --> 01:19:23.892 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:19:21.757 --> 01:19:26.161 region:rollup2
SMALL BUSINESSES INDIVIDUALS OF

01:19:23.892 --> 01:19:27.096 region:rollup2
LIKE WHAT DOES THAT MEAN SIXTIES

01:19:26.161 --> 01:19:29.632 region:rollup2
WITHOUT POWER AND HOW DO YOU

01:19:27.096 --> 01:19:30.766 region:rollup2
PREPARE IT'S NOT YOU KNOW GET

01:19:29.632 --> 01:19:33.068 region:rollup2
YOUR LITTLE BOX TOGETHER

01:19:30.766 --> 01:19:36.005 region:rollup2
IMMEDIATE SIX DAYS.

01:19:33.068 --> 01:19:37.406 region:rollup2
AND SO I THINK THAT WHATEVER WE

01:19:36.005 --> 01:19:40.342 region:rollup2
CAN DO SO LONG AS IT'S ALSO

01:19:37.406 --> 01:19:43.545 region:rollup2
INCLUDES A COMMUNICATIONS PLAN.

01:19:40.342 --> 01:19:44.747 region:rollup2
TO THE BEST POSSIBLE I MEAN

01:19:43.545 --> 01:19:45.714 region:rollup2
THIS WAS AN EMERGENCY THINGS

01:19:44.747 --> 01:19:47.516 region:rollup2
DIDN'T GO RIGHT BECAUSE IT IS AN

01:19:45.714 --> 01:19:49.351 region:rollup2
EMERGENCY. AND.

01:19:47.516 --> 01:19:50.419 region:rollup2
AND I WONDER RECOGNIZE THAT

01:19:49.351 --> 01:19:52.388 region:rollup2
THAT THERE'S ONLY SO MUCH AS

01:19:50.419 --> 01:19:55.758 region:rollup2
HUMANS THAT WE CAN DO AND

01:19:52.388 --> 01:19:56.892 region:rollup2
PREPARE FOR AND I BELIEVE THAT

01:19:55.758 --> 01:19:59.728 region:rollup2
WE REALLY TRIED TO DO THAT.

01:19:56.892 --> 01:20:00.496 region:rollup2
BUT IF THE COMMUNICATION PLAN

01:19:59.728 --> 01:20:03.866 region:rollup2
AROUND OUR.

01:20:00.496 --> 01:20:06.669 region:rollup2
OUR ELECTRICITY SUPPLY INCLUDES

01:20:03.866 --> 01:20:07.903 region:rollup2
KIND OF HELPING OUR CONSTITUENTS

01:20:06.669 --> 01:20:10.973 region:rollup2
GET THROUGH THAT MOMENT BECAUSE

01:20:07.903 --> 01:20:14.276 region:rollup2
I THINK AS ELECTED OFFICIALS AS

01:20:10.973 --> 01:20:14.710 region:rollup2
PUBLIC SAFETY. ON WE WERE ALL

01:20:14.276 --> 01:20:17.913 region:rollup2
FIGURED OUT BUT OUR

AND SO THE ONE THAT I'VE BEEN

01:27:07.823 --> 01:27:11.526 region:rollup2
SPENDING MOST OF MY TIME ON HIS

01:27:09.725 --> 01:27:13.161 region:rollup2
NEXT GENERATION NINE ONE ONE. SO

01:27:11.526 --> 01:27:14.362 region:rollup2
THAT'S LOCATED IN KIND OF THE

01:27:13.161 --> 01:27:15.630 region:rollup2
UPPER LEFT HAND CORNER OF THE

01:27:14.362 --> 01:27:16.731 region:rollup2
DIAGRAM.

01:27:15.630 --> 01:27:18.633 region:rollup2
SPOKE IS STUNNED GETTING THE

01:27:16.731 --> 01:27:20.502 region:rollup2
INFORMATION AND THE DATA FROM

01:27:18.633 --> 01:27:22.304 region:rollup2
THOSE WHO NEED HELP.

01:27:20.502 --> 01:27:23.839 region:rollup2
INTO OUR PUBLIC SAFETY ANSWERING

01:27:22.304 --> 01:27:25.207 region:rollup2
POINTS SO THEY CAN RECEIVE THE

01:27:23.839 --> 01:27:26.675 region:rollup2
HELP THEY NEED.

01:27:25.207 --> 01:27:28.443 region:rollup2
SO THAT'S KIND OF BEEN IN GRASS

01:27:26.675 --> 01:27:30.245 region:rollup2
PATH INTO THE AMERICAN C.

01:27:28.443 --> 01:27:31.947 region:rollup2
RESPONSE SYSTEM.

01:27:30.245 --> 01:27:32.914 region:rollup2
AND WE'VE GOT A LOT OF OUTREACH

01:27:31.947 --> 01:27:34.850 region:rollup2
AND AND EFFORT.

01:27:32.914 --> 01:27:35.684 region:rollup2
RELATED TO THAT MOVING FORWARD

01:27:34.850 --> 01:27:37.519 region:rollup2
SO WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT THAT'S

01:27:35.684 --> 01:27:39.254 region:rollup2
RESILIENT AND REDUNDANT AND

01:27:37.519 --> 01:27:40.522 region:rollup2
FUNDED PROPERLY SO ONCE IT

01:27:39.254 --> 01:27:42.824 region:rollup2
ARRIVES AT THE PUBLIC SAFETY

01:27:40.522 --> 01:27:43.758 region:rollup2
ANSWERING POINT. THE NEXT PIECE

01:27:42.824 --> 01:27:45.193 region:rollup2
OF THE PUZZLE WOULD BE THE

01:27:43.758 --> 01:27:46.194 region:rollup2
COMMUNICATION THAT HAPPENS

01:27:45.193 --> 01:27:48.363 region:rollup2
BETWEEN THAT PUBLIC SAFETY

01:27:46.194 --> 01:27:49.598 region:rollup2
ANSWERING POINT AND THOSE THAT

01:27:48.363 --> 01:27:51.466 region:rollup2
ARE OUT IN THE FIELD RESPONDING.

01:27:49.598 --> 01:27:52.567 region:rollup2
SO THERE'S BASICALLY TWO PADS

01:27:51.466 --> 01:27:54.603 region:rollup2
THERE ONE IS MISSION CRITICAL

01:27:52.567 --> 01:27:56.171 region:rollup2
VOICE.

01:27:54.603 --> 01:27:58.540 region:rollup2
IT'S SHOWN ON THIS DIAGRAM IS

01:27:56.171 --> 01:27:59.708 region:rollup2
LAND MOBILE RADIO SO THIS YOU

01:27:58.540 --> 01:28:01.143 region:rollup2
MAY HAVE HEARD ALOMAR LAND

01:27:59.708 --> 01:28:02.177 region:rollup2
MOBILE RADIO TERMS OF THIS IS

01:28:01.143 --> 01:28:04.312 region:rollup2
THE RADIOS AT THE USE FOR

01:28:02.177 --> 01:28:05.347 region:rollup2
MISSION CRITICAL. VOICE

01:28:04.312 --> 01:28:06.281 region:rollup2
COMMUNICATIONS

01:28:05.347 --> 01:28:08.016 region:rollup2
AND A LOT OF THE INTER

01:28:06.281 --> 01:28:09.284 region:rollup2
OPERABILITY CONVERSATIONS THAT

01:28:08.016 --> 01:28:10.519 region:rollup2
WE HAVE CENTER AROUND THAT ABOUT

01:28:09.284 --> 01:28:12.287 region:rollup2
HAVING CALM AND.

01:28:10.519 --> 01:28:13.388 region:rollup2
VOICE CHANNELS TO TALK ONE TO

01:28:12.287 --> 01:28:15.123 region:rollup2
ANOTHER AND.

01:28:13.388 --> 01:28:15.690 region:rollup2
THAT WAS SOME SOME OF THE

01:28:15.123 --> 01:28:16.625 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION IN THE PREVIOUS

01:28:15.690 --> 01:28:18.260 region:rollup2
PANEL.

01:28:16.625 --> 01:28:19.528 region:rollup2
THAT'S SYSTEMS BEEN IN PLACE A

01:28:18.260 --> 01:28:21.496 region:rollup2
LONG TIME ITS HARDENED ITS

01:28:19.528 --> 01:28:23.665 region:rollup2
PUBLIC SAFETY GRADE IT SURVIVES

01:28:21.496 --> 01:28:24.266 region:rollup2
THROUGHOUT THESE DISASTERS AND

01:28:23.665 --> 01:28:25.867 region:rollup2
IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S ALWAYS

01:28:24.266 --> 01:28:26.401 region:rollup2
AVAILABLE. AND WAS AVAILABLE

01:28:25.867 --> 01:28:27.903 region:rollup2
THROUGHOUT EACH OF THESE

01:28:26.401 --> 01:28:29.137 region:rollup2
DISASTERS THAT HAVE BEEN

01:28:27.903 --> 01:28:30.705 region:rollup2
DISCUSSED TODAY.

01:28:29.137 --> 01:28:31.806 region:rollup2
THE OTHER PIECE IN KIND OF THE

01:28:30.705 --> 01:28:33.141 region:rollup2
CENTER OF THE DIAGRAM IS WHERE

01:28:31.806 --> 01:28:34.242 region:rollup2
FIRST NIGHT IS.

01:28:33.141 --> 01:28:35.744 region:rollup2
AND SO I'VE ALSO CALLED THAT

01:28:34.242 --> 01:28:37.112 region:rollup2
BROADBAND SERVICES BECAUSE

01:28:35.744 --> 01:28:39.981 region:rollup2
ESSENTIALLY THIS IS YOUR DATA

01:28:37.112 --> 01:28:42.417 region:rollup2
CONNECTION FROM THOSE EMERGENCY

01:28:39.981 --> 01:28:43.485 region:rollup2
RESPONDERS WHO NEED THIS DATA.

01:28:42.417 --> 01:28:45.187 region:rollup2
BACK INTO THE PUBLIC SAFETY

01:28:43.485 --> 01:28:47.556 region:rollup2
ANSWERING POINTS.

01:28:45.187 --> 01:28:48.924 region:rollup2
SO THAT INFORMATION PRIMARILY

01:28:47.556 --> 01:28:50.225 region:rollup2
INTERACTS WITH THEIR COMPUTER

01:28:48.924 --> 01:28:51.760 region:rollup2
AIDED DISPATCH

01:28:50.225 --> 01:28:52.727 region:rollup2
SO THIS IS THE DISPATCH SYSTEM

01:28:51.760 --> 01:28:54.930 region:rollup2
THAT THEY USE TO SEND THE

01:28:52.727 --> 01:28:56.698 region:rollup2
INFORMATION FROM THE DISPATCHER

01:28:54.930 --> 01:28:58.700 region:rollup2
OUT TO THOSE IN THE FIELD.

01:28:56.698 --> 01:29:00.702 region:rollup2
THAT'S ONE OF THE PRIMARY

01:28:58.700 --> 01:29:02.537 region:rollup2
PURPOSES OF FIRST NET NOW FIRST

01:29:00.702 --> 01:29:03.572 region:rollup2
THAT HAS A WHOLE BUNCH OF OTHER.

01:29:02.537 --> 01:29:05.340 region:rollup2
ADVANTAGES THAT WERE GOING TO

01:29:03.572 --> 01:29:06.741 region:rollup2
TALK ABOUT IN A MOMENT BUT

01:29:05.340 --> 01:29:07.842 region:rollup2
THAT'S THE PRIMARY PIECE.

01:29:06.741 --> 01:29:09.444 region:rollup2
AND THEN ALONG THE BOTTOM OF

01:29:07.842 --> 01:29:10.545 region:rollup2
THIS DIAGRAM YOU SEE ALERTS AND

01:29:09.444 --> 01:29:12.080 region:rollup2
WARNINGS AND I'VE GOT THAT

01:29:10.545 --> 01:29:13.381 region:rollup2
LITTLE CIRCLE DRAWN IN THERE

01:29:12.080 --> 01:29:15.217 region:rollup2
UNDER.

01:29:13.381 --> 01:29:16.218 region:rollup2
LOCAL AUTHORITY.

01:29:15.217 --> 01:29:17.719 region:rollup2
THE LOCAL AUTHORITY MAKES THE

01:29:16.218 --> 01:29:19.154 region:rollup2
DECISION ON HOW TO ISSUE THOSE

01:29:17.719 --> 01:29:20.622 region:rollup2
AND AND YOU HEARD I SHARE

01:29:19.154 --> 01:29:23.425 region:rollup2
FIFTEEN. TALK ABOUT HIS

01:29:20.622 --> 01:29:25.093 region:rollup2
SOLUTIONS IN HIS COUNTY AND ON.

01:29:23.425 --> 01:29:26.194 region:rollup2
DECEMBER FOURTH THAT LAKE

01:29:25.093 --> 01:29:27.562 region:rollup2
COUNTY SHERIFF WAS HERE TO GIVE

01:29:26.194 --> 01:29:28.129 region:rollup2
YOU SOME OF THE LESSONS LEARNED

01:29:27.562 --> 01:29:29.664 region:rollup2
OVER THE OVER THAT AND YOU

01:29:28.129 --> 01:29:30.799 region:rollup2
PROBABLY REMEMBER. SO THAT'S

01:29:29.664 --> 01:29:33.268 region:rollup2
THAT BOTTOM PIECE AND THERE'S A

01:29:30.799 --> 01:29:34.236 region:rollup2
NUMBER OF TOOLS THAT ARE IN THAT

01:29:33.268 --> 01:29:35.971 region:rollup2
TOOLBOX

01:29:34.236 --> 01:29:37.339 region:rollup2
AND EACH ONE HAS A SPECIFIC

01:29:35.971 --> 01:29:39.107 region:rollup2
PURPOSE TO REACH A CERTAIN GROUP

01:29:37.339 --> 01:29:40.675 region:rollup2
OF FOLKS.

01:29:39.107 --> 01:29:42.644 region:rollup2
BUT I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:29:40.675 --> 01:29:44.646 region:rollup2
EVERYONE UNDERSTANDS IT'S NOT

01:29:42.644 --> 01:29:46.214 region:rollup2
FOLLOWING A REVERSE PATH THROUGH

01:29:44.646 --> 01:29:47.215 region:rollup2
NINE ONE ONE EVEN THOUGH IT'S

01:29:46.214 --> 01:29:49.017 region:rollup2
CALLED REVERSE NINE ONE ONE

01:29:47.215 --> 01:29:50.418 region:rollup2
SOMETIMES.

01:29:49.017 --> 01:29:52.153 region:rollup2
SO THERE IS A DISTINCTION ON THE

01:29:50.418 --> 01:29:52.787 region:rollup2
PATH THAT IT TAKES TO GET BACK

01:29:52.153 --> 01:29:53.822 region:rollup2
TO THOSE THAT ARE RECEIVING THE

01:29:52.787 --> 01:29:55.190 region:rollup2
WARNING.

01:29:53.822 --> 01:29:55.690 region:rollup2
AND AND IT'S FAIRLY IMPORTANT

01:29:55.190 --> 01:29:57.158 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THE NETWORKS ARE

01:29:55.690 --> 01:29:58.059 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT.

01:29:57.158 --> 01:29:59.327 region:rollup2
SO THIS IS HOW THESE

01:29:58.059 --> 01:30:00.629 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGIES ARE RELATED AND

01:29:59.327 --> 01:30:01.162 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY AT THE SENATE ABOUT

01:30:00.629 --> 01:30:03.999 region:rollup2
ALL THIS THE PUBLIC SAFETY

01:30:01.162 --> 01:30:05.634 region:rollup2
ANSWERING POINTS.

01:30:03.999 --> 01:30:07.636 region:rollup2
THE NEXT GRAPHIC IS IS TO HELP

01:30:05.634 --> 01:30:10.605 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND THE CONNECTIONS

01:30:07.636 --> 01:30:12.173 region:rollup2
BETWEEN NEXT GEN NINE ONE ONE

01:30:10.605 --> 01:30:13.675 region:rollup2
ARE NEXT GENERATION NINE ONE ONE

01:30:12.173 --> 01:30:15.477 region:rollup2
AND FIRST NOW SO THAT'S THE NEXT

01:30:13.675 --> 01:30:16.511 region:rollup2
GRAPHIC.

01:30:15.477 --> 01:30:18.079 region:rollup2
AND YOU'LL NOTICE PROBABLY IN

01:30:16.511 --> 01:30:19.314 region:rollup2
THE CENTER OF THAT DIAGRAM

01:30:18.079 --> 01:30:20.582 region:rollup2
THERE'S THIS WHITE BUBBLE THAT

01:30:19.314 --> 01:30:22.417 region:rollup2
SAYS NEXT AND I'M ONE

01:30:20.582 --> 01:30:24.853 region:rollup2
INTEGRATION TO FIRST NET THERE'S

01:30:22.417 --> 01:30:27.956 region:rollup2
THIS INTEGRATION HAS TO HAPPEN.

01:30:24.853 --> 01:30:30.091 region:rollup2
NEXT GEN NINE ONE ONE WILL TAKE.

01:30:27.956 --> 01:30:31.760 region:rollup2
DATA RICH INFORMATION FROM THOSE

01:30:30.091 --> 01:30:33.595 region:rollup2
THAT NEED HELP AND SEND IT INTO

01:30:31.760 --> 01:30:34.095 region:rollup2
THE PUBLIC SAFETY ANSWERING

01:30:33.595 --> 01:30:35.630 region:rollup2
POINT THAT'S WHAT WE'RE

01:30:34.095 --> 01:30:37.365 region:rollup2
DESIGNING IT TO DO.

01:30:35.630 --> 01:30:39.000 region:rollup2
FIRST NOT HAS THE ABILITY TO

01:30:37.365 --> 01:30:40.802 region:rollup2
TAKE THAT INFORMATION A PUSH IT

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:42.337 region:rollup2
OUT TO THE EMERGENCY RESPONDER

01:30:40.802 --> 01:30:43.772 region:rollup2
WHO MIGHT NEED THAT INFORMATION.

01:30:42.337 --> 01:30:45.273 region:rollup2
THERE'S A CRITICAL CONNECTION

01:30:43.772 --> 01:30:47.175 region:rollup2
HAS TO HAPPEN BETWEEN THOSE TWO

01:30:45.273 --> 01:30:48.376 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGIES AT THE PUBLIC

01:30:47.175 --> 01:30:49.844 region:rollup2
SAFETY ANSWERING POINT.

01:30:48.376 --> 01:30:51.379 region:rollup2
IS THAT SOME OF THE EFFORTS THAT

01:30:49.844 --> 01:30:53.114 region:rollup2
ARE UNDER GO THAT WE'RE UNDER

01:30:51.379 --> 01:30:54.149 region:rollup2
UNDER WAY RIGHT NOW.

01:30:53.114 --> 01:30:55.517 region:rollup2
YOU NOTICE IN THE UPPER LEFT

01:30:54.149 --> 01:30:57.986 region:rollup2
HAND CORNER WE CAN HAVE TWO

01:30:55.517 --> 01:30:59.888 region:rollup2
COLUMNS THERE OF WHAT FIRST NET

01:30:57.986 --> 01:31:01.489 region:rollup2
IS TODAY RIGHT NOW.

01:30:59.888 --> 01:31:02.958 region:rollup2
AND THERE'S A ROLL OUT PLAN I

01:31:01.489 --> 01:31:04.292 region:rollup2
KNOW THAT EIGHTEEN TO INFER

01:31:02.958 --> 01:31:05.860 region:rollup2
CENTER PROBABLY GONNA TALK ABOUT

01:31:04.292 --> 01:31:07.696 region:rollup2
THIS IN THE NEXT PANEL. BUT

01:31:05.860 --> 01:31:09.698 region:rollup2
THERE'S SOME FEATURES THAT WILL

01:31:07.696 --> 01:31:10.865 region:rollup2
EVENTUALLY BE AVAILABLE ONE DAY

01:31:09.698 --> 01:31:12.600 region:rollup2
AND THERE SOME FEATURES THAT ARE

01:31:10.865 --> 01:31:13.335 region:rollup2
AVAILABLE TODAY RIGHT NOW AND

01:31:12.600 --> 01:31:14.636 region:rollup2
THERE'S A LITTLE DIFFERENCE

01:31:13.335 --> 01:31:15.937 region:rollup2
BETWEEN THOSE TWO BECAUSE IT'S A

01:31:14.636 --> 01:31:18.373 region:rollup2
ROLL OUT PLAN.

01:31:15.937 --> 01:31:19.874 region:rollup2
THE OPTIM DECISION CAME IN DC ON

01:31:18.373 --> 01:31:21.676 region:rollup2
DECEMBER TWENTY EIGHTH. AND SO%

01:31:19.874 --> 01:31:23.478 region:rollup2
WERE FAIRLY NEW IN THIS PROCESS

01:31:21.676 --> 01:31:25.313 region:rollup2
AND SO RIGHT NOW PRIORITY IN

01:31:23.478 --> 01:31:26.481 region:rollup2
PREEMPTION. MEANING THAT IF

01:31:25.313 --> 01:31:28.149 region:rollup2
THERE'S A PUBLIC SAFETY

01:31:26.481 --> 01:31:28.850 region:rollup2
RESPONDER WHO SUBSCRIBE TO FIRST

01:31:28.149 --> 01:31:31.186 region:rollup2
NET.

01:31:28.850 --> 01:31:32.988 region:rollup2
THEY GET PRIORITY.

01:31:31.186 --> 01:31:35.323 region:rollup2
ACCESS INTO THE NETWORK AND IF

01:31:32.988 --> 01:31:37.192 region:rollup2
THAT CELL TOWERS CLOG PREEMPTION

01:31:35.323 --> 01:31:38.526 region:rollup2
SAYS THEY GET HEAD OF THE LINE

01:31:37.192 --> 01:31:39.861 region:rollup2
IN THE PUSH SOME OTHER LOWER

01:31:38.526 --> 01:31:41.196 region:rollup2
PRIOR TO USE OUR OFFICE OF THAT

01:31:39.861 --> 01:31:41.696 region:rollup2
THEY GET ACCESS.

01:31:41.196 --> 01:31:43.164 region:rollup2
THOSE ARE VERY IMPORTANT

01:31:41.696 --> 01:31:45.567 region:rollup2
FEATURES.

01:31:43.164 --> 01:31:46.735 region:rollup2
AS WE MOVE INTO THE FUTURE THE

01:31:45.567 --> 01:31:48.403 region:rollup2
AT THE CAUGHT THINGS WE'VE

01:31:46.735 --> 01:31:49.871 region:rollup2
IDENTIFIED IN THE NEXT COLUMN OR

01:31:48.403 --> 01:31:50.805 region:rollup2
SOME OF THINGS THAT CAL O. YES

01:31:49.871 --> 01:31:53.041 region:rollup2
IS GONNA BE WORKING IN A

01:31:50.805 --> 01:31:54.409 region:rollup2
PARTNERSHIP WITH A TNT AND FIRST

01:31:53.041 --> 01:31:55.643 region:rollup2
NET. TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS

01:31:54.409 --> 01:31:57.912 region:rollup2
FIRST NIGHT NETWORK ALSO

01:31:55.643 --> 01:32:00.382 region:rollup2
PROVIDES ALL THESE FEATURES AS

01:31:57.912 --> 01:32:00.882 region:rollup2
WELL BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT THAT'S

01:32:00.382 --> 01:32:03.184 region:rollup2
ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL TO.

01:32:00.882 --> 01:32:05.920 region:rollup2
SASSER FIRST NOW.

01:32:03.184 --> 01:32:06.888 region:rollup2
SO WITH THAT HIGH LEVEL OVERVIEW

01:32:05.920 --> 01:32:09.557 region:rollup2
I'M WILL TURN OVER TO THE BACK

01:32:06.888 --> 01:32:10.959 region:rollup2
OF IMAGE.

01:32:09.557 --> 01:32:13.261 region:rollup2
SO WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO

01:32:10.959 --> 01:32:13.261 region:rollup2
SEEING THE SEACOAST FEAR COME

01:34:49.884 --> 01:34:53.354 region:rollup2
DEVASTATING. BUT THE FOOTPRINT

01:34:51.452 --> 01:34:54.489 region:rollup2

LACK OF IN OUR REALLY ARE

01:35:00.094 --> 01:35:03.131 region:rollup2
FAILURE COMMUNICATION WAS IN

NEEDING SOME RESCUE AT OURSELVES

01:35:25.720 --> 01:35:29.157 region:rollup2
WE WERE TOTALLY WITHOUT

01:35:27.221 --> 01:35:30.725 region:rollup2
COMMUNICATION AT THAT TIME.

01:35:29.157 --> 01:35:31.759 region:rollup2
OR OUTSIDE OF OUR LITTLE SPHERE

01:35:30.725 --> 01:35:33.528 region:rollup2
COMMUNICATION CONSISTED OF

01:35:31.759 --> 01:35:35.029 region:rollup2
CELLULAR.

01:35:33.528 --> 01:35:36.331 region:rollup2

01:35:45.807 --> 01:35:50.345 region:rollup2
IT'S STARTLING AT FIRST.

01:35:48.243 --> 01:35:52.113 region:rollup2
I WISH I COULD SAY THAT WAS THE

01:35:50.345 --> 01:35:53.881 region:rollup2
ONLY TIME I FACE THAT.

01:35:52.113 --> 01:35:55.350 region:rollup2

COMMUNICATE WITH THEM BECAUSE WE

01:37:43.524 --> 01:37:45.159 region:rollup2

01:37:55.136 --> 01:37:58.139 region:rollup2
I'M.

01:37:58.139 --> 01:38:01.609 region:rollup2
VERDANT FIRST THAT COMES ON LINE

01:37:59.941 --> 01:38:03.544 region:rollup2
I'M SURE THAT THEY'RE GOING TO

01:38:01.609 --> 01:38:05.480 region:rollup2
HAVE SOLUTIONS TO MANY OF THESE.

01:38:03.544 --> 01:38:07.849 region:rollup2
BUT I WOULD AS A AS A LOCAL FIRE

01:38:05.480 --> 01:38:09.951 region:rollup2
CHIEF IS SPENT. TWELVE YEARS

01:38:07.849 --> 01:38:12.019 region:rollup2
MANAGING A LOCAL FIRE BUDGET. I

01:38:09.951 --> 01:38:14.122 region:rollup2
WOULD JUST ASK YOU TO ME. TO

01:38:12.019 --> 01:38:14.489 region:rollup2
CONSIDER AND ALL ALL PARTIES ARE

01:38:14.122 --> 01:38:15.356 region:rollup2
GOING FOR THAT.

01:38:14.489 --> 01:38:16.991 region:rollup2
FOR THOSE OF US THAT ARE

01:38:15.356 --> 01:38:18.626 region:rollup2
INVOLVED AS FIRST RESPONDERS ARE

01:38:16.991 --> 01:38:20.061 region:rollup2
SOLUTION NEEDS TO BE ROBUST AND

01:38:18.626 --> 01:38:21.696 region:rollup2
REDUNDANT. IT NEEDS TO BE

01:38:20.061 --> 01:38:22.630 region:rollup2
AFFORDABLE.

01:38:21.696 --> 01:38:24.665 region:rollup2
WE NEED AN EASY MAINTAIN.

01:38:22.630 --> 01:38:26.267 region:rollup2
.

01:38:24.665 --> 01:38:28.102 region:rollup2
IT NEEDS TO BE PROVEN TECHNOLOGY

01:38:26.267 --> 01:38:29.504 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT WE CAN RELY ON

01:38:28.102 --> 01:38:31.439 region:rollup2
AND IT'S EASY TO USE KNOW WHAT

01:38:29.504 --> 01:38:33.841 region:rollup2
I'VE SEEN.

01:38:31.439 --> 01:38:34.542 region:rollup2
OVER THE LAST FORTY.

01:38:33.841 --> 01:38:36.944 region:rollup2
THREE YEARS.

01:38:34.542 --> 01:38:39.614 region:rollup2
IS THAT TECHNOLOGY IS INFLUENCE

01:38:36.944 --> 01:38:41.682 region:rollup2
WHAT WE DO. FAR FIREFIGHTERS AND

01:38:39.614 --> 01:38:43.751 region:rollup2
POLICE OFFICERS IN EMS PERSONNEL

01:38:41.682 --> 01:38:45.253 region:rollup2
AND MERGING MANAGE IT WE WE HAVE

01:38:43.751 --> 01:38:46.320 region:rollup2
INTEGRATED APPROPRIATE LIKE WE

01:38:45.253 --> 01:38:47.855 region:rollup2
HAVE IN OUR OWN HOMES.

01:38:46.320 --> 01:38:50.658 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGY AND EVERYTHING WE DO

01:38:47.855 --> 01:38:52.627 region:rollup2
HOWEVER WHEN TECHNOLOGY FAILS.

01:38:50.658 --> 01:38:54.362 region:rollup2
OR THE SUPPORTING ASPECTS OF

01:38:52.627 --> 01:38:56.230 region:rollup2
THAT POWER.

01:38:54.362 --> 01:38:58.499 region:rollup2
WHICH HAS BEEN A PROBLEM.

01:38:56.230 --> 01:38:59.867 region:rollup2
.

01:38:58.499 --> 01:39:00.701 region:rollup2
WE BECOME RELIANT ON IT AND THEN

01:38:59.867 --> 01:39:03.237 region:rollup2
WE HAVE AVOID.

01:39:00.701 --> 01:39:05.540 region:rollup2
.

01:39:03.237 --> 01:39:06.674 region:rollup2
I'M NOT GONNA REPEAT I THINK

01:39:05.540 --> 01:39:08.776 region:rollup2
SHARE TEAM POINT OUT.

01:39:06.674 --> 01:39:10.411 region:rollup2
VERY WELL HOW MANY OF OUR

01:39:08.776 --> 01:39:11.512 region:rollup2
COUNTIES ARE USING.

01:39:10.411 --> 01:39:12.647 region:rollup2
THINGS LIKE EVER BRIDGE FOR

01:39:11.512 --> 01:39:13.448 region:rollup2
PUBLIC NOTIFICATION A LAYERED

01:39:12.647 --> 01:39:15.483 region:rollup2
EFFECT.

01:39:13.448 --> 01:39:18.085 region:rollup2
.

01:39:15.483 --> 01:39:20.087 region:rollup2
AND I THINK FOR ME MANY NOT ALL

01:39:18.085 --> 01:39:22.023 region:rollup2
OF OUR OUR COMMUNITIES HAVE A A

01:39:20.087 --> 01:39:24.292 region:rollup2
PRETTY STRONG LOCAL NETWORK FOR

01:39:22.023 --> 01:39:27.328 region:rollup2
RADIO COMMUNICATION.

01:39:24.292 --> 01:39:30.465 region:rollup2
I'M NOT EXPECTING THAT VIDEO.

01:39:27.328 --> 01:39:33.234 region:rollup2
STREAMING.

01:39:30.465 --> 01:39:35.937 region:rollup2
ONLINE CHATTING.

01:39:33.234 --> 01:39:38.573 region:rollup2
TEXT MESSAGING OR ANYTHING ELSE.

01:39:35.937 --> 01:39:40.708 region:rollup2
I WOULD REALLY HAVE HOUSTON JUST

01:39:40.708 --> 01:39:44.378 region:rollup2
BEEN IN SOME VOICE COMMUNICATION

01:39:42.610 --> 01:39:45.746 region:rollup2
THE ABILITY TO TALK TO SOMEBODY.

01:39:44.378 --> 01:39:47.381 region:rollup2
WOULD HAVE BEEN REALLY IMPORTANT

01:39:45.746 --> 01:39:54.622 region:rollup2
HAD TO COMMUNICATE FOR BOTH AND

01:39:47.381 --> 01:39:56.257 region:rollup2

MUTUAL AID PROGRAM.

01:39:59.994 --> 01:40:03.097 region:rollup2

AN AREA THAT WE'RE LOOKING OUT

01:41:33.554 --> 01:41:36.591 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT'S OF VERY IMPORTANT

01:41:34.822 --> 01:41:37.191 region:rollup2
THEY'RE THEY'RE TRANSPORTING

GRAPHIC WAS TO BE.

01:41:45.600 --> 01:41:49.003 region:rollup2
NOT OVERWHELM WITH DATA BECAUSE

01:41:47.468 --> 01:41:50.938 region:rollup2
IF WE WERE TO SHOW EVERY

01:41:49.003 --> 01:41:52.373 region:rollup2
APPLICATION THAT POTENTIALLY

01:41:50.938 --> 01:41:54.208 region:rollup2
COULD RUN OVER FIRST NAT. OR

01:41:52.373 --> 01:41:55.977 region:rollup2
OVER A BROADBAND SERVICE AT THE

01:41:54.208 --> 01:41:56.777 region:rollup2
WHOLE PAGE WILL BE FULL SO

01:41:55.977 --> 01:41:58.546 region:rollup2
ABSOLUTELY ALL OF THOSE

01:41:56.777 --> 01:42:00.314 region:rollup2
APPLICATIONS THAT ARE NEEDED TO

01:41:58.546 --> 01:42:02.216 region:rollup2

SO APOLOGIZE IT'S A LITTLE

01:42:06.387 --> 01:42:08.990 region:rollup2
SPARSE.

01:42:08.089 --> 01:42:10.224 region:rollup2

READY TO HANDLE DISASTER.

01:42:59.106 --> 01:43:02.877 region:rollup2
WHEN THIS HER KINGS CAME THERE

DRONE OUT THERE NOW THAT'S THE

01:44:37.505 --> 01:44:40.541 region:rollup2
CELL TOWER BECAUSE THE CELL

MAYBE SO I JUST DID WHAT BUT THE

01:44:50.584 --> 01:44:52.953 region:rollup2
INVESTMENT TO FINALLY FELL IN

01:44:51.785 --> 01:44:54.021 region:rollup2
THE DARK ABOUT THE NOW

01:44:52.953 --> 01:44:55.556 region:rollup2
DIVERGENCES THERE CAN YOU

01:44:54.021 --> 01:44:58.058 region:rollup2
SUDDENLY SET UP A QUICK

01:44:55.556 --> 01:44:59.727 region:rollup2
COMMUNICATIONS LINK TO THAT DARK

01:44:58.058 --> 01:45:00.728 region:rollup2
SPOT I MEAN YOU DON'T HAVE TIME

01:44:59.727 --> 01:45:01.962 region:rollup2
TO WAIT FOR SOMEONE TO BUILD

01:45:00.728 --> 01:45:05.266 region:rollup2
SOMETHING RIGHT. AND THE SEND

01:45:01.962 --> 01:45:05.1000 region:rollup2
SOME WINE OUT THERE SO IS IT. IS

01:45:05.266 --> 01:45:07.868 region:rollup2
THAT'S SOMETHING WE'RE WORKING

01:45:05.1000 --> 01:45:10.004 region:rollup2
ON AND TERMS OF BEING ABLE TO

01:45:07.868 --> 01:45:12.907 region:rollup2
REALLY LIKE I COME UP WITH

01:45:10.004 --> 01:45:13.474 region:rollup2
COMMUNICATIONS SOLUTIONS THAT

01:45:12.907 --> 01:45:14.975 region:rollup2
CAN BE SET UP AND YOU KNOW.

01:45:13.474 --> 01:45:16.577 region:rollup2
THE FEW HOURS OR SOMETHING AND

01:45:14.975 --> 01:45:17.745 region:rollup2
AND AND AND A PLACE AND THEN

01:45:16.577 --> 01:45:18.712 region:rollup2
HOOK IT INTO THE.

01:45:17.745 --> 01:45:20.214 region:rollup2
THE MAIN EIGHT THAT I WOULD

01:45:18.712 --> 01:45:20.848 region:rollup2
THINK THAT THAT'S A KIND OF

01:45:20.214 --> 01:45:22.249 region:rollup2
CAPABILITY WE SHOULD BE LOOKING

01:45:20.848 --> 01:45:23.317 region:rollup2
INTO.

01:45:22.249 --> 01:45:24.852 region:rollup2
SO IT'S A GREAT QUESTION.

01:45:23.317 --> 01:45:27.354 region:rollup2
.

01:45:24.852 --> 01:45:29.190 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY IT DEPENDS ON THE TYPE

01:45:27.354 --> 01:45:30.457 region:rollup2
OF EVENT HAD THAT CAUSES THE

01:45:29.190 --> 01:45:31.659 region:rollup2
OTHER DAMAGE AND SO THE FIRES

01:45:30.457 --> 01:45:32.860 region:rollup2
WERE OBVIOUSLY UNIQUE

01:45:31.659 --> 01:45:34.295 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENT WHERE YOU.

01:45:32.860 --> 01:45:36.597 region:rollup2
DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO GO BACK

01:45:34.295 --> 01:45:38.299 region:rollup2
AND REBUILD. OUR YOU WOULD NEED

01:45:36.597 --> 01:45:39.667 region:rollup2
THAT THAT COVERAGE IN BECAUSE.

01:45:38.299 --> 01:45:41.769 region:rollup2
YOU HEARD IT MENTIONED BEFORE

01:45:39.667 --> 01:45:42.303 region:rollup2
THE TOPOGRAPHY AND GEOGRAPHY THE

01:45:41.769 --> 01:45:44.205 region:rollup2
STATE.

01:45:42.303 --> 01:45:45.406 region:rollup2
THAT THOSE THEIR SOULS KEY

01:45:44.205 --> 01:45:47.474 region:rollup2
MOUNTAIN TOPS ARE OBVIOUSLY THE

01:45:45.406 --> 01:45:50.344 region:rollup2
BEST POINTS. AT THE PLACE I

01:45:47.474 --> 01:45:50.845 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE OF FORESTS AND IF

01:45:50.344 --> 01:45:52.580 region:rollup2
YOU CAN'T ACCESS THEM.

01:45:50.845 --> 01:45:55.082 region:rollup2
OF COURSE IT DOESN'T WORK AS

01:45:52.580 --> 01:45:56.517 region:rollup2
WELL HAVING SAID THAT. COME.

01:45:55.082 --> 01:45:57.418 region:rollup2
ARE PARTNERS IN THE COMMUNITY

01:45:56.517 --> 01:45:59.453 region:rollup2
THEY CAN TALK ABOUT IT MORE IN

01:45:57.418 --> 01:46:01.655 region:rollup2
THEIR IN THEIR PERIOD. HARM TO

01:46:01.655 --> 01:46:05.793 region:rollup2
AS THEY TRY TO BRING IN PART TO

01:46:03.190 --> 01:46:08.295 region:rollup2
PROVIDE. SOME ACCESS FOR US INTO

01:46:05.793 --> 01:46:09.363 region:rollup2
TO REPLICATE WHEN.

01:46:08.295 --> 01:46:11.098 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE IS DAMAGED.

01:46:09.363 --> 01:46:12.166 region:rollup2
AND THAT CAN WORK ARE REALLY

01:46:11.098 --> 01:46:13.801 region:rollup2
WELL IF THERE'S WHAT THEY CALL

SORT OF EVOLVED SAYING THAT. WE

01:51:03.157 --> 01:51:05.359 region:rollup2
BASICALLY.

01:51:04.124 --> 01:51:06.460 region:rollup2
DIDN'T HAVE A WHOLE LOT OF

01:51:05.359 --> 01:51:07.661 region:rollup2
CHOICE

01:51:06.460 --> 01:51:09.363 region:rollup2
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE POLITICS

01:51:07.661 --> 01:51:11.465 region:rollup2

TO RESPOND TO SOME OF.

01:51:14.902 --> 01:51:19.206 region:rollup2
THE CONCERNS THAT HE EXPRESSED.

01:51:17.504 --> 01:51:21.041 region:rollup2
PARTICULARLY.

01:51:19.206 --> 01:51:22.809 region:rollup2
.

01:51:21.041 --> 01:51:25.045 region:rollup2
WHETHER OR NOT THEY ARE

01:51:22.809 --> 01:51:27.014 region:rollup2
ADDRESSING THE THREE CONCERNS

01:51:25.045 --> 01:51:29.783 region:rollup2
ONE BEING INTER OPERABILITY. OF

01:51:27.014 --> 01:51:30.050 region:rollup2
THE SECOND BEING SECURITY THIS.

01:51:29.783 --> 01:51:30.751 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY.

01:51:30.050 --> 01:51:32.486 region:rollup2
.

01:51:30.751 --> 01:51:34.721 region:rollup2
DOESN'T.

01:51:32.486 --> 01:51:37.157 region:rollup2
APPARENTLY DOESN'T HAVE.

01:51:34.721 --> 01:51:39.092 region:rollup2
TO GIVE ACCESS TO OUR LAW

01:51:37.157 --> 01:51:40.761 region:rollup2
ENFORCEMENT PEOPLE TO USE THESE.

01:51:39.092 --> 01:51:42.663 region:rollup2
THE CLUTCH SYSTEM IN THE OTHER

01:51:40.761 --> 01:51:43.430 region:rollup2
CRIMINAL JUSTICE INFORMATION

01:51:42.663 --> 01:51:44.998 region:rollup2
SYSTEMS WHICH I KNOW MY

01:51:43.430 --> 01:51:46.567 region:rollup2
COLLEAGUE IS ASSEMBLY MEMBER

01:51:44.998 --> 01:51:48.335 region:rollup2
COOPER IS WELL AWARE OF AND.

01:51:46.567 --> 01:51:49.503 region:rollup2
VERY IMPORTANT IN THE WORK THAT

01:51:48.335 --> 01:51:51.038 region:rollup2
THAT HE AND OTHER LAW

01:51:49.503 --> 01:51:53.473 region:rollup2
ENFORCEMENT PEOPLE DO AND HAVE

01:51:51.038 --> 01:51:54.541 region:rollup2
DONE. AND THEN THE THIRD ITEM.

01:51:53.473 --> 01:51:56.476 region:rollup2
IS HARDENING.

01:51:54.541 --> 01:51:58.745 region:rollup2
IS THE POINT THAT YOU KNOW THE

01:51:56.476 --> 01:51:59.246 region:rollup2
CELLULAR SITES AS YOU MENTIONED

01:51:58.745 --> 01:52:00.213 region:rollup2
THIS IS BEEN PART OF THE

01:51:59.246 --> 01:52:01.815 region:rollup2
PROBLEM.

01:52:00.213 --> 01:52:03.183 region:rollup2
UP IN THE HILLS WHICH HAVE BEEN

01:52:01.815 --> 01:52:04.818 region:rollup2
THE FIRST THING THE GOAL WHEN I

01:52:03.183 --> 01:52:06.453 region:rollup2
THINK ALSO WERE IN THE NORTHERN

01:52:04.818 --> 01:52:08.889 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA FIRES. WE KNOW CELL

COMMUNICATION.

01:52:10.224 --> 01:52:13.794 region:rollup2
AND SO WE NEED THAT RESILIENCY

01:52:11.925 --> 01:52:15.195 region:rollup2
IN THE REDUNDANCY AND AS I

01:52:13.794 --> 01:52:18.031 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND THAT'S WHAT THIS.

01:52:15.195 --> 01:52:20.067 region:rollup2
PROGRAM IS SUPPOSED TO PROVIDE.

01:52:18.031 --> 01:52:22.169 region:rollup2
AND YET THERE IS CONCERN THAT

01:52:20.067 --> 01:52:23.503 region:rollup2
THAT ISN'T NECESSARILY WHAT HAS

01:52:22.169 --> 01:52:25.572 region:rollup2
BEEN OFFERED SO I'M.

01:52:23.503 --> 01:52:27.841 region:rollup2

SAME QUESTIONS TO OUR.

01:52:37.184 --> 01:52:41.188 region:rollup2
FIRST MET PEOPLE WHAT THEY'RE

01:52:38.952 --> 01:52:41.822 region:rollup2
DOING TO ADDRESS THOSE CONCERNS

01:52:41.188 --> 01:52:43.190 region:rollup2
BECAUSE.

01:52:41.822 --> 01:52:44.524 region:rollup2
I THINK THEY'RE LEGITIMATE AND I

01:52:43.190 --> 01:52:46.493 region:rollup2
THINK THEY'RE APPROPRIATE FOR

01:52:44.524 --> 01:52:47.828 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA AND WE HAVE LEARNED

01:52:46.493 --> 01:52:50.697 region:rollup2

WITH THE FIRES AND.

01:52:52.232 --> 01:52:55.836 region:rollup2
HOW ARE WE GOING TO MAKE SURE

01:52:53.700 --> 01:52:57.271 region:rollup2
THAT WE HAVE THAT REDUNDANCY AND

01:52:55.836 --> 01:52:59.806 region:rollup2
RESILIENCY THAT THE PEOPLE OF

01:52:57.271 --> 01:53:00.941 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA? AFFECTIVELY PAYING

01:52:59.806 --> 01:53:01.975 region:rollup2
FOR AND EXPECT.

01:53:00.941 --> 01:53:03.744 region:rollup2
SO COULD YOU KIND OF UPDATE US

01:53:01.975 --> 01:53:05.412 region:rollup2
ON THAT.

01:53:03.744 --> 01:53:07.848 region:rollup2
GOING FORWARD NOT GOING BACK

01:53:05.412 --> 01:53:08.081 region:rollup2
WHICH WERE GOING FORWARD. YES.

01:53:07.848 --> 01:53:09.516 region:rollup2
SINCE.

01:53:08.081 --> 01:53:11.551 region:rollup2
THE.

01:53:09.516 --> 01:53:12.919 region:rollup2
OFTEN A DECISION WAS MADE WE'VE

01:53:11.551 --> 01:53:14.721 region:rollup2
HAD A SERIES OF MEETINGS WITH A

01:53:12.919 --> 01:53:17.424 region:rollup2
WITH A TNT AND I CONTINUE TO

01:53:14.721 --> 01:53:17.624 region:rollup2
WORK WITH THEM. OF THE EXAMPLES

01:53:17.424 --> 01:53:18.358 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:53:17.624 --> 01:53:19.493 region:rollup2
YOU.

01:53:18.358 --> 01:53:21.628 region:rollup2
YOU'VE MENTIONED WITH SIX HOURS

01:53:19.493 --> 01:53:22.562 region:rollup2
IN THE NOW SIX DAYS IN WHICH ARE

01:53:21.628 --> 01:53:24.197 region:rollup2
TALKING ABOUT. HOW?

01:53:22.562 --> 01:53:25.832 region:rollup2
?

01:53:24.197 --> 01:53:28.535 region:rollup2
HOW LONG CAN YOU OPERATE NOW

01:53:25.832 --> 01:53:30.070 region:rollup2
WITHOUT POWER AND AND AND ACCESS

01:53:28.535 --> 01:53:31.371 region:rollup2
IN AND TO THOSE AREAS AND SO?

01:53:30.070 --> 01:53:32.939 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY WE WANT THE MOST

01:53:31.371 --> 01:53:34.541 region:rollup2
RESILIENT SYSTEM POSSIBLE THAT'S

01:53:32.939 --> 01:53:36.977 region:rollup2
WHAT OUR EFFORTS ARE.

01:53:34.541 --> 01:53:38.645 region:rollup2
TO WORK WITH ANYA EIGHTEEN T.

01:53:36.977 --> 01:53:39.212 region:rollup2
INFERS THAT CONTINUE TO WORK

01:53:38.645 --> 01:53:41.848 region:rollup2
WITH US AND.

01:53:39.212 --> 01:53:43.483 region:rollup2
HAVE.

01:53:41.848 --> 01:53:45.652 region:rollup2
INDICATED THAT THEY'RE GOING TO.

01:53:43.483 --> 01:53:48.021 region:rollup2
CONTINUE TO WORK ON THE SITE

01:53:45.652 --> 01:53:49.423 region:rollup2
HARDENING OTHERS A SOLUTION WITH

01:53:48.021 --> 01:53:49.990 region:rollup2
THAT MOTION FOR THE FOR THE

01:53:49.423 --> 01:53:53.126 region:rollup2
KLUTZ ACCESS.

01:53:49.990 --> 01:53:54.528 region:rollup2
.

01:53:53.126 --> 01:53:56.296 region:rollup2
OUR BIGGEST ISSUE IS THAT WE

01:53:54.528 --> 01:53:57.698 region:rollup2
WANTED IT DONE IT SHOULD BE A AN

01:53:56.296 --> 01:53:58.999 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL CHARGE.

01:53:57.698 --> 01:54:00.300 region:rollup2
AND SO THEY'VE COME FOR WITH A

01:53:58.999 --> 01:54:02.102 region:rollup2
GOOD SOLUTION FORCE VERSION

01:54:00.300 --> 01:54:03.704 region:rollup2
THINK THAT THE.

01:54:02.102 --> 01:54:04.571 region:rollup2
THE SHOP TO PAY FOR IT SHOULD BE

01:54:03.704 --> 01:54:05.305 region:rollup2
PART OF YOUR SERVICE PACKAGE AND

01:54:04.571 --> 01:54:07.674 region:rollup2
SO.

01:54:05.305 --> 01:54:08.642 region:rollup2
OF SO YOU CAN IMAGINE WERE.

01:54:07.674 --> 01:54:09.176 region:rollup2
WORKING THAT ADD TOGETHER

01:54:08.642 --> 01:54:11.111 region:rollup2
JOINTLY.

01:54:09.176 --> 01:54:12.713 region:rollup2
ON OUR NEGOTIATION SO FOR THAT

01:54:11.111 --> 01:54:14.047 region:rollup2
TRYING TO FIND WHAT'S BEST FOR

OUR STAKEHOLDERS.

01:54:14.047 --> 01:54:16.416 region:rollup2
AND THEN THE INTER OPERABILITY

01:54:14.948 --> 01:54:17.984 region:rollup2
PIECE.

01:54:16.416 --> 01:54:19.953 region:rollup2
IS STILL SOMETHING THAT WERE

01:54:17.984 --> 01:54:20.387 region:rollup2
TRYING TO ADDRESS A LOT AREAS

01:54:19.953 --> 01:54:21.888 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:54:20.387 --> 01:54:22.889 region:rollup2
ARE GOING TO BE USING VERIZON

01:54:21.888 --> 01:54:24.558 region:rollup2

01:54:22.889 --> 01:54:25.592 region:rollup2
FOR AWHILE NOW WHILE EIGHTEEN

01:54:24.558 --> 01:54:28.295 region:rollup2
HE BUILDS OUT HEATHER

01:54:25.592 --> 01:54:29.563 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE. AND SO ON IN

01:54:28.295 --> 01:54:31.131 region:rollup2
THOSE AREAS WE WERE HOPING TO

01:54:29.563 --> 01:54:32.432 region:rollup2
HAVE SOME SORT OF IN OUR ABILITY

01:54:31.131 --> 01:54:34.534 region:rollup2

WE LISTENED TO THOSE THAT ARE

01:55:00.394 --> 01:55:04.197 region:rollup2

HOW DO WE BRING THAT FORTY FOUR

01:57:51.565 --> 01:57:56.036 region:rollup2

SERVICE THAT WE OFFERED EVERY

01:58:08.448 --> 01:58:11.651 region:rollup2
PUBLIC SAFETY ANSWERING POINT.

01:58:10.250 --> 01:58:13.820 region:rollup2
AND THAT CONTRACT IS VERY

01:58:11.651 --> 01:58:15.789 region:rollup2
SPECIFIC THE TOP FIVE.

LANGUAGES ARE ACCOMMODATED

01:58:15.789 --> 01:58:20.060 region:rollup2
WITHIN YOU KNOW SECONDS OF WHEN

01:58:17.958 --> 01:58:21.695 region:rollup2
IT COMES AND AND THEN THE REST

THINK ABOUT THE PACKED COMING IN

01:58:25.065 --> 01:58:28.868 region:rollup2
WE'VE ADDRESS THAT THROUGH THE

01:58:26.499 --> 01:58:30.303 region:rollup2
NET THAT NEXT GEN I'M ONE SYSTEM

01:58:28.868 --> 01:58:32.172 region:rollup2
IN THE EXISTING NINE ONE SYSTEM.

PUSHING THE INFORMATION OUT

01:58:34.207 --> 01:58:37.777 region:rollup2
THRILLER AND WARNINGS.

01:58:35.809 --> 01:58:38.378 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'VE

01:58:37.777 --> 01:58:39.946 region:rollup2
BEEN WORKING.

01:58:38.378 --> 01:58:41.281 region:rollup2
IN AT CALLAWAY ASKED TO

01:58:39.946 --> 01:58:43.016 region:rollup2
IDENTIFY THOSE NEEDS.

01:58:41.281 --> 01:58:44.184 region:rollup2
IN EVEN ALL THE WAY UP THROUGH

01:58:43.016 --> 01:58:46.486 region:rollup2
THE FCC.

01:58:44.184 --> 01:58:47.887 region:rollup2
THROUGH TEXT TRANSLATION AND

01:58:46.486 --> 01:58:50.490 region:rollup2
FOREIGN LANGUAGE TRANSLATION

01:58:47.887 --> 01:58:51.825 region:rollup2
THOSE TECHNOLOGIES ARE NEWARK

01:58:50.490 --> 01:58:53.226 region:rollup2
AND ARE FULLY DEPLOYED BUT THOSE

01:58:51.825 --> 01:58:54.661 region:rollup2
ARE SOME THINGS WE'RE LOOKING AT

01:58:53.226 --> 01:58:55.695 region:rollup2
TO GET THAT DATA GOING BACK OUT

01:58:54.661 --> 01:58:57.230 region:rollup2
IN IN A IN A WAY THAT CAN BE

01:58:55.695 --> 01:58:58.965 region:rollup2
UNDERSTOOD.

01:58:57.230 --> 01:58:59.899 region:rollup2
YOU RUN INTO SOME CHARACTER SET

01:58:58.965 --> 01:59:01.635 region:rollup2
ISSUES WITH SOME OF THE

01:58:59.899 --> 01:59:02.702 region:rollup2
LANGUAGES THAT YOU CAN IMAGINE

01:59:01.635 --> 01:59:03.269 region:rollup2
AND THOSE ARE SOME OF THE

01:59:02.702 --> 01:59:05.038 region:rollup2
CHALLENGES IN THE TECHNOLOGY

01:59:03.269 --> 01:59:07.040 region:rollup2
SIDE.

01:59:05.038 --> 01:59:08.508 region:rollup2
AND I AM GLAD THAT THAT THAT

01:59:07.040 --> 01:59:09.809 region:rollup2
THAT WORK IS HAPPENING BECAUSE

01:59:08.508 --> 01:59:12.445 region:rollup2
IT FORTY FOUR PERCENT AS WELL AS

01:59:09.809 --> 01:59:14.147 region:rollup2
BEING NUMBER AND THIS IS AT A

01:59:12.445 --> 01:59:15.515 region:rollup2
PUBLIC SAFETY ISSUE.

01:59:14.147 --> 01:59:17.317 region:rollup2
WHEN YOU KNOW WHEN AWAY REALIZE

01:59:15.515 --> 01:59:18.318 region:rollup2
WHEN A STREET GOT TRANSLATE ELSE

01:59:17.317 --> 01:59:19.886 region:rollup2
LIKE NO THAT'S NOT WHAT YOU'RE

01:59:18.318 --> 01:59:20.887 region:rollup2
SUPPOSE TO TRANSLATE THE STREET

01:59:19.886 --> 01:59:22.322 region:rollup2
NOT THE STREET NAME BECAUSE

01:59:20.887 --> 01:59:24.024 region:rollup2
THERE IS NO STREET NAME. WITH

01:59:22.322 --> 01:59:25.358 region:rollup2
THAT TRANSLATION IT'S IN ENGLISH

01:59:24.024 --> 01:59:26.459 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE LOOK FOR

01:59:25.358 --> 01:59:28.128 region:rollup2
AND SO THERE'S ELEMENTS LIKE

01:59:26.459 --> 01:59:30.430 region:rollup2
THAT THAT ARE VERY IMPORTANT TO

01:59:28.128 --> 01:59:31.965 region:rollup2
EVERYBODY. I'M IN THAT COMMUNITY

01:59:30.430 --> 01:59:32.932 region:rollup2
SO I'M I'M GLAD TO HEAR THAT THE

01:59:31.965 --> 01:59:34.267 region:rollup2
CONVERSATIONS ARE HAVING AND I

01:59:32.932 --> 01:59:36.169 region:rollup2
HOPE WE DON'T DROP THOSE BECAUSE

01:59:34.267 --> 01:59:37.504 region:rollup2
THOSE ARE DEFINITELY PART.

01:59:36.169 --> 01:59:40.440 region:rollup2
THE OF OF OF REALLY IMPORTANT

01:59:37.504 --> 01:59:41.374 region:rollup2
PART OF HOW WE KEEP THE

01:59:40.440 --> 01:59:43.309 region:rollup2
COMMUNICATION GOING.

01:59:41.374 --> 01:59:45.178 region:rollup2
TO THANK YOU MR GRUBER. IS PHONE

01:59:43.309 --> 01:59:46.780 region:rollup2
UPON SENATOR JACKSON'S COME

01:59:45.178 --> 01:59:48.615 region:rollup2

01:59:48.615 --> 01:59:51.184 region:rollup2
FIREPROOF FOR FOUR HOURS

01:59:50.283 --> 01:59:51.718 region:rollup2
WHEN THE HARD THE SIDES OF THE

01:59:51.184 --> 01:59:53.086 region:rollup2
CAN DO THAT FOR FOUR EIGHT

01:59:51.718 --> 01:59:54.387 region:rollup2
HOURS.

01:59:53.086 --> 01:59:57.023 region:rollup2
AND THEN TALK ABOUT TALK ABOUT

01:59:54.387 --> 01:59:57.657 region:rollup2
COMMUNICATIONS VERY FOR PORTABLE

01:59:57.023 --> 01:59:58.491 region:rollup2
RADIO FOR AN OFFICER TO HAVE ON

01:59:57.657 --> 02:00:00.527 region:rollup2
THEIR HIP.

01:59:58.491 --> 02:00:02.429 region:rollup2
BEFORE THE DOLLARS APIECE

02:00:00.527 --> 02:00:02.829 region:rollup2
FOR RADIO FOR REGULAR VEHICLES

02:00:02.429 --> 02:00:04.898 region:rollup2
ABOUT FIFTY FIVE.

02:00:02.829 --> 02:00:05.498 region:rollup2
FIVE HUNDRED BUCKS

02:00:04.898 --> 02:00:06.599 region:rollup2
SO THEY'RE VERY EXPENSIVE MAY

02:00:05.498 --> 02:00:07.667 region:rollup2
CHANGE

02:00:06.599 --> 02:00:09.302 region:rollup2
THE FORTY FOUR INDUCTS FOR

02:00:07.667 --> 02:00:11.037 region:rollup2
PORTABLE RADIO.

02:00:09.302 --> 02:00:12.472 region:rollup2
SO I GUESS THE ISSUE IS AT SOME

02:00:11.037 --> 02:00:14.040 region:rollup2
POINT THINGS DO GO DOWN.

02:00:12.472 --> 02:00:14.507 region:rollup2
I WAS TOLD THERE SOME SYSTEM

02:00:14.040 --> 02:00:16.076 region:rollup2
WHERE BOUNCES OFF THE

02:00:14.507 --> 02:00:17.010 region:rollup2
ATMOSPHERE.

02:00:16.076 --> 02:00:17.410 region:rollup2
ANOTHER COMMUNICATION DEVICE

02:00:17.010 --> 02:00:20.080 region:rollup2
BECAUSE.

02:00:17.410 --> 02:00:22.148 region:rollup2
.

02:00:20.080 --> 02:00:24.284 region:rollup2
THE NET STUFF IS GREAT BUT. I

02:00:22.148 --> 02:00:24.818 region:rollup2
WAS FOR A BACKUP SO.

02:00:24.284 --> 02:00:26.820 region:rollup2
WHAT OTHER SYSTEMS ARE OUT

02:00:24.818 --> 02:00:28.088 region:rollup2
THERE?

02:00:26.820 --> 02:00:30.056 region:rollup2
IT A RELIABLE AND AFTER A LOT

02:00:28.088 --> 02:00:32.892 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE ATMOSPHERE ATMOSPHERIC

02:00:30.056 --> 02:00:33.460 region:rollup2
FANEUIL MUCH ABOUT IT.

02:00:32.892 --> 02:00:34.761 region:rollup2
PETERSON SOME OF THOSE OTHER

02:00:33.460 --> 02:00:36.796 region:rollup2
OPTIONS.

02:00:34.761 --> 02:00:37.831 region:rollup2
YEAH BETWEEN BUDGET I KNOW HE'S

02:00:36.796 --> 02:00:40.633 region:rollup2
MY TECHNICAL EXPERTS I'M JUST.

02:00:37.831 --> 02:00:41.601 region:rollup2
THE.

02:00:40.633 --> 02:00:43.436 region:rollup2
THE TALKING ADDICT VIA.

02:00:41.601 --> 02:00:44.671 region:rollup2
SO.

02:00:43.436 --> 02:00:45.972 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW YOUR LAND MOBILE RADIO

02:00:44.671 --> 02:00:47.740 region:rollup2
THE TRIBUTE TO TALK ABOUT THEIR

02:00:45.972 --> 02:00:48.808 region:rollup2
IT IS GOING TO CONTINUE THAT IS

02:00:47.740 --> 02:00:50.744 region:rollup2
GOING TO STAY IN PLACE FOR YOUR

02:00:48.808 --> 02:00:51.311 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW YOUR OFFICERS AND LOG

FIRE.

02:00:51.311 --> 02:00:55.348 region:rollup2
THAT'S NOT GOING AWAY ANYTIME

02:00:52.679 --> 02:00:56.683 region:rollup2
AND SO HOW WE WORK HAND IN HAND

02:00:55.348 --> 02:00:57.484 region:rollup2
WITH ALL OF THE STATE AGENCIES

02:00:56.683 --> 02:00:58.852 region:rollup2
THAT WE SUPPORT WITH OUR LAMB

02:00:57.484 --> 02:01:00.120 region:rollup2
OPERATOR SYSTEM HERE TECH

A DIVISION SO.

02:01:03.490 --> 02:01:05.959 region:rollup2
AND THOSE ARE PUBLIC SAFETY

02:01:04.390 --> 02:01:08.528 region:rollup2
GRADE AND AS A BUDGET POINTED

02:01:05.959 --> 02:01:10.029 region:rollup2
OUT AND WE HAD NO LOSSES FOR ANY

02:01:08.528 --> 02:01:11.598 region:rollup2

OUR TOWERS OR STRUCTURE EVEN

02:01:20.406 --> 02:01:23.743 region:rollup2
THOUGH WE LOST POWER WE HAD YOU

02:01:21.608 --> 02:01:24.144 region:rollup2
MINUTES MISTER CASES WE HAVE

02:01:23.743 --> 02:01:26.045 region:rollup2
SEVEN DAYS OF OF.

02:01:24.144 --> 02:01:28.581 region:rollup2
A FEW ON HAND WERE ABLE TO

FIRE CHP FISHING GAME HOW MANY

02:01:31.618 --> 02:01:34.287 region:rollup2
LOCAL AGENCIES THAT ARE ARE ARE

02:01:33.052 --> 02:01:36.723 region:rollup2
HUNG ON OUR SAME.

TOWERS FOR THE STARS APPEARED

02:01:36.723 --> 02:01:40.126 region:rollup2
THAT THE REASON DISCUSSING IT

02:01:38.224 --> 02:01:40.994 region:rollup2
YOU USE THAT'S THE THE SAME

02:01:40.126 --> 02:01:42.862 region:rollup2
NETWORK THAT WE'RE USING MISSILE

02:01:40.994 --> 02:01:43.830 region:rollup2
HIT LUGER TOWERS BUT WE LOST

02:01:42.862 --> 02:01:45.165 region:rollup2
CELTA.

02:01:43.830 --> 02:01:46.800 region:rollup2
CORRECT I GUESS I GUESS IN YOUR

MOUNTAINTOPS SO I GUESS KNOWS

02:01:50.803 --> 02:01:52.505 region:rollup2
FOR THOSE AREAS WHY DID.

02:01:51.938 --> 02:01:54.474 region:rollup2
YOUR TOWERS SURVIVED AND NOT

02:01:52.505 --> 02:01:56.843 region:rollup2
THE.

02:01:54.474 --> 02:01:57.844 region:rollup2
CELLPHONE TOWERS.

02:01:56.843 --> 02:01:59.445 region:rollup2
THEY'RE JUST THEY'RE DIFFERENT

02:01:57.844 --> 02:02:00.113 region:rollup2
GREAT STRUCTURE AND EIGHTEEN T.

HERE BUT THE BUT THE BOTTOM

02:02:03.349 --> 02:02:06.619 region:rollup2
LINES WERE BUILT WAS A PUBLIC

02:02:04.984 --> 02:02:09.022 region:rollup2
SAFETY GREAT THAT'S WHAT WE'RE.

02:02:06.619 --> 02:02:10.123 region:rollup2
ARM ART CHARTERS HIS TO SPORTS

02:02:09.022 --> 02:02:11.357 region:rollup2
IN PUBLIC SAFETY GRAY.

02:02:10.123 --> 02:02:12.625 region:rollup2
NETWORK SERVED THIRTY ZAINAL

02:02:11.357 --> 02:02:13.793 region:rollup2
DIFFERENTLY AND SO THEY CAN THEY

02:02:12.625 --> 02:02:15.228 region:rollup2
CAN ANSWER THAT FOR YOU BUT I

02:02:13.793 --> 02:02:16.796 region:rollup2
WILL SAY THAT.

02:02:15.228 --> 02:02:18.164 region:rollup2
AS WE GOING TO FIRST NET

02:02:16.796 --> 02:02:19.833 region:rollup2
BECAUSE FIRST IT'S NOT ANY OTHER

02:02:18.164 --> 02:02:21.034 region:rollup2
TOOL FOR THE OFFICERS ARE OUT

02:02:19.833 --> 02:02:23.069 region:rollup2
THERE. WILL HAVE THAT CELLPHONE

02:02:21.034 --> 02:02:24.537 region:rollup2
IN HER HAND BEING ABLE TO USE

02:02:23.069 --> 02:02:26.206 region:rollup2
THAT LTE NETWORK THAT THEY

02:02:24.537 --> 02:02:27.040 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY HAVE. AND THEY'RE

02:02:26.206 --> 02:02:28.741 region:rollup2
GONNA BE ABLE TO USE ALL THESE

02:02:27.040 --> 02:02:30.310 region:rollup2
VARIOUS APPLICATIONS OTHER GONNA

02:02:28.741 --> 02:02:32.111 region:rollup2
BE FOR THEM AND SO.

02:02:30.310 --> 02:02:33.646 region:rollup2
IT IS IMPORTANT OBVIOUSLY WHICH

02:02:32.111 --> 02:02:34.480 region:rollup2
IS WHY THAT RESILIENCY FOR THAT

02:02:33.646 --> 02:02:35.515 region:rollup2
NETWORK IS IMPORTANT US TO MAKE

02:02:34.480 --> 02:02:37.250 region:rollup2
SURE THAT.

02:02:35.515 --> 02:02:38.117 region:rollup2
THAT THE CARRIERS.

02:02:37.250 --> 02:02:39.719 region:rollup2
MAKE IT IS RESILIENT AS

02:02:38.117 --> 02:02:42.822 region:rollup2
POSSIBLE REDUNDANCY AS POSSIBLE

02:02:39.719 --> 02:02:43.656 region:rollup2
SO THAT. THEY HAVE AN EXTRA TWO

02:02:42.822 --> 02:02:45.592 region:rollup2
ON THEIR HANDS WE GOTTA MAKE

02:02:43.656 --> 02:02:46.526 region:rollup2
SURE TOWERS SURVIVED YOU

02:02:45.592 --> 02:02:48.228 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDING UPGRADING THOSE

02:02:46.526 --> 02:02:50.463 region:rollup2
TOWERS. IN THOSE AREAS THAT ARE

02:02:48.228 --> 02:02:51.130 region:rollup2
PRONE TO FIRES. I'M WE

02:02:50.463 --> 02:02:54.567 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDED THAT.

02:02:51.130 --> 02:02:57.036 region:rollup2
A SERIES OF OF OF PIECES TO IT

02:02:54.567 --> 02:02:58.605 region:rollup2
IT'S A YOU KNOW DEBRIS CLEARANCE

02:02:57.036 --> 02:03:01.474 region:rollup2
FROM THE AREAS.

02:02:58.605 --> 02:03:03.543 region:rollup2
HARDENING GENERATORS.

02:03:01.474 --> 02:03:07.013 region:rollup2
HOWARD THE SET UP IN A LOT OF

02:03:03.543 --> 02:03:08.848 region:rollup2
THE. OTHER THINGS THAT WE BUILD

02:03:07.013 --> 02:03:11.451 region:rollup2
INTO OUR STRUCTURE OFFICE TODAY

02:03:08.848 --> 02:03:13.419 region:rollup2
A LOT MORE TOWERS AND WE DO.

02:03:11.451 --> 02:03:14.821 region:rollup2
BUT NONE THE LESS BECAUSE

02:03:13.419 --> 02:03:16.856 region:rollup2
THERE'S MICROCELLULAR LARGE

02:03:14.821 --> 02:03:17.757 region:rollup2
CELLS IN VARIOUS DIFFERENT TYPES

02:03:16.856 --> 02:03:19.626 region:rollup2
BUT.

02:03:17.757 --> 02:03:21.194 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY THE MORE RESILIENT

02:03:19.626 --> 02:03:23.263 region:rollup2
THEY ARE THE MORE REDUNDANCY

02:03:21.194 --> 02:03:26.733 region:rollup2
PASSER OUT THERE TO PICK UP THE

02:03:23.263 --> 02:03:28.234 region:rollup2
LOAD FOR THEM. A MEANS THAT OUR

02:03:26.733 --> 02:03:33.606 region:rollup2
FIRST RESPONDER COMMUNITY WILL

02:03:28.234 --> 02:03:34.107 region:rollup2
HAVE A RELIABLE NETWORK TO USE A

02:03:33.606 --> 02:03:34.707 region:rollup2
WHEN THEY'RE USING EPO.

02:03:34.107 --> 02:03:35.575 region:rollup2
I'M ONE OF THE OTHER THINGS

02:03:34.707 --> 02:03:36.442 region:rollup2
WE'VE DONE IS WE GAVE A LIST OF

02:03:35.575 --> 02:03:37.043 region:rollup2
BLOCKED SITES THAT SUPPORT

02:03:36.442 --> 02:03:37.677 region:rollup2
CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE OF OF

02:03:37.043 --> 02:03:38.311 region:rollup2
THESE ARE CELL SITES THAT ARE

02:03:37.677 --> 02:03:38.745 region:rollup2
OVER A PUBLIC SAFETY ANSWERING

02:03:38.311 --> 02:03:39.279 region:rollup2
POINTS. OR OVER SOME

02:03:38.745 --> 02:03:39.946 region:rollup2
OTHER-MISSION CRITICAL.

02:03:39.279 --> 02:03:40.546 region:rollup2
POINT THROUGHOUT THE STATE FIVE

02:03:39.946 --> 02:03:41.614 region:rollup2
HUNDRED SEVENTY ONE OF THOSE

02:03:40.546 --> 02:03:42.382 region:rollup2
THAT WE GAVE DE TNT THROUGH OUR

02:03:41.614 --> 02:03:43.182 region:rollup2
ANALYSIS AND THEY COMMITTED TO

02:03:42.382 --> 02:03:43.483 region:rollup2
HARDENING THOSE AND THAT'S THE

02:03:43.182 --> 02:03:44.050 region:rollup2
FIRST STEP.

02:03:43.483 --> 02:03:46.152 region:rollup2
SO YOU CAN IMAGINE THERE ARE

02:03:44.050 --> 02:03:47.787 region:rollup2
THOUSANDS OF CELL SITES AND

02:03:46.152 --> 02:03:49.188 region:rollup2
WE'VE ASKED FOR A SMALL PIECE TO

02:03:47.787 --> 02:03:51.257 region:rollup2
BE HARDENED. REALLY FOR THE

02:03:49.188 --> 02:03:52.659 region:rollup2
NETWORK TO BE SURVIVABLE TO YOU

02:03:51.257 --> 02:03:54.994 region:rollup2
KNOW SUPPORT EVERYTHING WE'VE

02:03:52.659 --> 02:03:56.362 region:rollup2
DISCUSSED HERE TODAY LEON TIRES

02:03:54.994 --> 02:03:58.398 region:rollup2
THING WOULD NEED TO BE HARDENED

02:03:56.362 --> 02:03:59.432 region:rollup2
TO ANOTHER LEVEL AND THAT WAS IN

02:03:58.398 --> 02:04:01.067 region:rollup2
OUR INITIAL ASK.

02:03:59.432 --> 02:04:02.201 region:rollup2
THAT WE NICK TRIED TO NEGOTIATE

02:04:01.067 --> 02:04:03.770 region:rollup2
AND SO IT'S SOMETHING THAT

02:04:02.201 --> 02:04:04.737 region:rollup2
MOVING FORWARD WE KNOW WE'RE

02:04:03.770 --> 02:04:05.972 region:rollup2
GONNA HAVE TO WORK WITH THEM TO

02:04:04.737 --> 02:04:07.640 region:rollup2
MAKE SURE THAT THIS NETWORK AND

02:04:05.972 --> 02:04:09.509 region:rollup2
SURVIVE IN. AND THROUGH THOSE

02:04:07.640 --> 02:04:10.743 region:rollup2
TWO PIECES IT'S THE POWER INTO

02:04:09.509 --> 02:04:12.245 region:rollup2
THE SITE.

02:04:10.743 --> 02:04:14.013 region:rollup2
AND IT'S THE DATA BACK ALL THAT

02:04:12.245 --> 02:04:15.148 region:rollup2
CONNECTS THE SITE BACK TO THE

02:04:14.013 --> 02:04:16.349 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW TO THE PIECES THAT ARE

02:04:15.148 --> 02:04:18.384 region:rollup2
MAKING THE DECISIONS ON WHERE TO

02:04:16.349 --> 02:04:20.853 region:rollup2
SEND THE CALL. BOTH OF THOSE ARE

02:04:18.384 --> 02:04:22.121 region:rollup2
WHAT WE'RE WORKING ON THANK YOU.

02:04:20.853 --> 02:04:23.289 region:rollup2

REGARDING DIRECTOR KILLER

02:13:16.288 --> 02:13:19.592 region:rollup2
SOME OF THOSE THREE AREAS SO

02:13:17.923 --> 02:13:21.126 region:rollup2
INTER OPERABILITY.

DRIVING ACROSS.

02:14:07.973 --> 02:14:11.810 region:rollup2
ON THE NETWORK AND HAVING OUR

02:14:10.342 --> 02:14:13.946 region:rollup2

02:14:11.810 --> 02:14:16.348 region:rollup2
SUPPORT THOSE FEATURES FOR FIRST

02:14:13.946 --> 02:14:19.151 region:rollup2
NET USERS.

02:14:16.348 --> 02:14:21.921 region:rollup2
IN TERMS OF SITE HARDENING.

02:14:19.151 --> 02:14:24.023 region:rollup2
WE DO HAVE AS PART OF OUR

CYBERSECURITY.

02:14:30.329 --> 02:14:34.333 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I KNOW CALIFORNIA HAS.

02:14:32.398 --> 02:14:35.467 region:rollup2

02:14:46.378 --> 02:14:50.015 region:rollup2
THOSE OF ADDITIONAL DISCUSSIONS

02:14:48.814 --> 02:14:51.517 region:rollup2
WE HAD THE WITH THE STATE WERE

02:14:50.015 --> 02:14:54.386 region:rollup2
ALSO INCLUDED AS AS PART OF THE

02:14:51.517 --> 02:14:56.422 region:rollup2
STATE PLAN. IN A SIDE LETTER.

02:14:54.386 --> 02:14:58.958 region:rollup2
AND I AM HAPPY TO REPORT THAT

02:14:56.422 --> 02:15:02.261 region:rollup2
THIS MORNING WE FIRST SET AND

02:14:58.958 --> 02:15:03.796 region:rollup2
EIGHTEEN T. ANNOUNCED THAT.

02:15:02.261 --> 02:15:05.764 region:rollup2
WE WILL BEGIN THE ACTUAL

02:15:03.796 --> 02:15:07.800 region:rollup2
DEPLOYMENT OF NETWORK WHICH

02:15:05.764 --> 02:15:09.268 region:rollup2
MEANS THAT THOSE DOCUMENTS IN

02:15:07.800 --> 02:15:11.036 region:rollup2
THOSE ITEMS THAT WERE INCLUDED

02:15:09.268 --> 02:15:13.205 region:rollup2
AS PART OF STATE PLAN HAVE BEEN

02:15:11.036 --> 02:15:15.207 region:rollup2
CODIFIED IN NOW IS PART OF THE

02:15:13.205 --> 02:15:17.376 region:rollup2
PLAN OF RECORD.

02:15:15.207 --> 02:15:18.811 region:rollup2
TO START DEPLOYING IN CALIFORNIA

02:15:17.376 --> 02:15:21.113 region:rollup2
SO I THINK THE SHOWS THAT THE

02:15:18.811 --> 02:15:23.582 region:rollup2
PROCESS WHEREBY THE INPUT FROM

02:15:21.113 --> 02:15:26.085 region:rollup2
THE STATE AND FIRST RESPONDERS.

02:15:23.582 --> 02:15:28.754 region:rollup2
CAN BE PUT AS PART AND WILL BE

02:15:26.085 --> 02:15:32.191 region:rollup2
ACTED UPON AND ACTIONABLE.

02:15:28.754 --> 02:15:33.892 region:rollup2
THROUGH THIS CONTRACT.

02:15:32.191 --> 02:15:37.229 region:rollup2
AND THE LAST QUESTION IS ON

02:15:33.892 --> 02:15:38.597 region:rollup2
SECURITY. AND I THINK TO DAILY

02:15:37.229 --> 02:15:40.299 region:rollup2
WE ALREADY HAVE SOLUTIONS IN

02:15:38.597 --> 02:15:40.899 region:rollup2
PLACE.

02:15:40.299 --> 02:15:47.573 region:rollup2
DAY AS FAR AS I UNDERSTAND TO

02:15:40.899 --> 02:15:49.308 region:rollup2
SEE JUST INFORMATION. THAT

02:15:47.573 --> 02:15:51.810 region:rollup2
ENTITY.

02:15:49.308 --> 02:15:53.646 region:rollup2
I USUALLY HAVE TO BE CERTIFIED

02:15:51.810 --> 02:15:55.681 region:rollup2
THROUGH THEIR STATE. AND LET'S

02:15:53.646 --> 02:15:57.850 region:rollup2
AGENCY.

02:15:55.681 --> 02:15:58.984 region:rollup2
ON AND THAT'S A SYSTEM WHERE AND

02:15:57.850 --> 02:16:00.719 region:rollup2
I YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT GOING TO

02:15:58.984 --> 02:16:02.254 region:rollup2
CHANGE.

02:16:00.719 --> 02:16:05.257 region:rollup2
THERE WOULD THE CERTIFICATION

02:16:02.254 --> 02:16:06.558 region:rollup2
PROCESS BY FIRST HAVING FIRST

02:16:05.257 --> 02:16:08.127 region:rollup2
THAT ITSELF. FLATTENED AREA

02:16:06.558 --> 02:16:10.763 region:rollup2
WHERE YOU KNOW THAT THE ENTITY

02:16:08.127 --> 02:16:12.631 region:rollup2
THAT IS REQUESTING INFORMATION.

02:16:10.763 --> 02:16:13.265 region:rollup2
AND WHAT'S TO USE THAT

02:16:12.631 --> 02:16:14.833 region:rollup2
INFORMATION MOST OF YOU KNOW

02:16:13.265 --> 02:16:16.201 region:rollup2
THAT'S STILL GOING TO BE MANAGED

02:16:14.833 --> 02:16:18.971 region:rollup2
BY THE LOCAL ENTITY AND THE

02:16:16.201 --> 02:16:20.105 region:rollup2
LOCAL ENTITIES REQUIREMENTS TO

MEET THE FBI REQUIREMENTS.

02:16:20.105 --> 02:16:23.642 region:rollup2
SO I THINK IT'S A LITTLE BIT

02:16:22.107 --> 02:16:25.144 region:rollup2
MORE COMPLICATED.

02:16:23.642 --> 02:16:26.512 region:rollup2
COM THAN THAT THERE ARE OTHER

02:16:25.144 --> 02:16:28.514 region:rollup2
SOLUTIONS AVAILABLE AND IN THE

02:16:26.512 --> 02:16:29.748 region:rollup2
FUTURE THERE MAY BE NO OTHER

02:16:28.514 --> 02:16:31.250 region:rollup2
SOLUTIONS OTHER THAN.

02:16:29.748 --> 02:16:33.318 region:rollup2
THAT MOTION BUT THAT'S WHAT WE

02:16:38.257 --> 02:16:41.894 region:rollup2
AND OUR AND OTHER PARTNERS.

02:16:40.159 --> 02:16:42.995 region:rollup2
TO LOOK AT SOLUTIONS ON HOW TO

02:16:41.894 --> 02:16:45.564 region:rollup2
MAKE THAT EASIER BUT.

02:16:42.995 --> 02:16:47.399 region:rollup2
IT'S FAR IS GOING THROUGH UPON

02:16:45.564 --> 02:16:48.500 region:rollup2
WHAT WE HAVE TODAY A YOU KNOW

02:16:47.399 --> 02:16:50.636 region:rollup2

PROCESS.

02:33:31.903 --> 02:33:36.474 region:rollup2
PRIOR TO EVEN RELEASING THE RFP

02:33:34.605 --> 02:33:38.142 region:rollup2
WE HELD TO INDUSTRY DAYS THERE

02:33:36.474 --> 02:33:40.645 region:rollup2
WERE SEVERAL PUBLIC NOTICES.

02:33:38.142 --> 02:33:42.113 region:rollup2
ASKING THE COMMUNITY HOW THEY

THAT.

02:33:49.720 --> 02:33:53.391 region:rollup2
SO IN THE FINAL ARE P. WE

02:33:52.156 --> 02:33:55.059 region:rollup2
LOOKED THAT PRIMARILY TWO

02:33:53.391 --> 02:33:56.527 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT WAYS FOR ASSESSMENT

02:33:55.059 --> 02:33:58.262 region:rollup2
THE FIRST IS THE ACTUAL

02:33:56.527 --> 02:34:01.799 region:rollup2
DEPLOYMENT OF THE NETWORK. HOW

02:33:58.262 --> 02:34:03.601 region:rollup2
MUCH OF THE POPULATION COVERAGE

02:34:01.799 --> 02:34:04.902 region:rollup2
WILL THE VENDOR BE ABLE TO

PROVIDE?

02:34:04.902 --> 02:34:08.239 region:rollup2
WHETHER THAT WOULD BE BANNED

02:34:06.204 --> 02:34:10.108 region:rollup2
FOURTEEN THAT'S THE FIRST THAT

02:34:08.239 --> 02:34:11.809 region:rollup2
SPECTRUM THE TWENTY MEGAHERTZ OF

02:34:10.108 --> 02:34:14.378 region:rollup2
SPECTRUM THAT THERE BE USING.

02:34:11.809 --> 02:34:18.015 region:rollup2
BUT ALSO ANY NON BAND FOURTEEN.

02:34:14.378 --> 02:34:19.917 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTATIONS OR OPERATION.

02:34:18.015 --> 02:34:20.518 region:rollup2
SO EVERY VENDOR THAT SUBMITTED A

02:34:19.917 --> 02:34:22.720 region:rollup2
BID.

02:34:20.518 --> 02:34:24.122 region:rollup2
HOW TO SHOW US HOW THEY WOULD

02:34:22.720 --> 02:34:25.456 region:rollup2
BUILD OUT AND TO WHAT DEGREE

02:34:24.122 --> 02:34:26.924 region:rollup2
THEY WOULD BUILD OUT THE NETWORK

02:34:25.456 --> 02:34:28.793 region:rollup2
NATIONWIDE?

02:34:26.924 --> 02:34:30.695 region:rollup2
ON THE SECOND IS ADOPTION

02:34:28.793 --> 02:34:32.630 region:rollup2
TARGETS SOLD THE WAY CONGRESS

02:34:30.695 --> 02:34:34.298 region:rollup2
ENVISIONED OUR PROGRAM YOU KNOW

02:34:32.630 --> 02:34:35.833 region:rollup2
WE DIDN'T WANT TO JUST BUILD IT

02:34:34.298 --> 02:34:37.301 region:rollup2
AND THEN IT ALL JUST LANGUISH IN

02:34:35.833 --> 02:34:39.437 region:rollup2
NOBODY'S ACTION CAN USE IT.

02:34:37.301 --> 02:34:40.304 region:rollup2
SO FIRST THAT CREATES AT THE

02:34:39.437 --> 02:34:43.241 region:rollup2
FIRST RESPONDER NETWORK

02:34:40.304 --> 02:34:44.675 region:rollup2
AUTHORITY THEN CREATED ARE ASKED

ADOPTION TARGETS.

02:35:04.295 --> 02:35:09.600 region:rollup2
AND WITHIN THAT STRUCTURE.

02:35:07.665 --> 02:35:12.103 region:rollup2

I'M CONCERNED THAT. THIS IS A

02:40:30.788 --> 02:40:34.892 region:rollup2
NATIONWIDE PROGRAM EVERY STATE

02:40:32.990 --> 02:40:36.360 region:rollup2
HAS ITS OWN SET OF ISSUES WE'VE

02:40:34.892 --> 02:40:37.561 region:rollup2
SEEN WHAT SOME OF THEM ARE IN

02:40:36.360 --> 02:40:39.196 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA.

EXPECTATIONS OF THE PEOPLE

02:40:46.871 --> 02:40:50.841 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIANS IMPORTANT. I THINK

TO ALL OF US AND CERTAINLY. I

02:40:50.841 --> 02:40:54.211 region:rollup2

THIS PROGRAM IN A WAY THAT'S

02:40:55.980 --> 02:40:59.483 region:rollup2
GOING TO MEET THOSE NEEDS AS

02:40:58.015 --> 02:41:00.584 region:rollup2
WE'VE SEEN THEM THROUGH THESE

02:40:59.483 --> 02:41:02.386 region:rollup2
VARIOUS.

02:41:00.584 --> 02:41:03.888 region:rollup2
TRAGIC EVENTS IN AND

AND AND I DO APPRECIATE THAT.

02:41:09.360 --> 02:41:13.164 region:rollup2
EIGHTEEN TIAS.

02:41:12.329 --> 02:41:14.665 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WORKING ON THIS SOME

02:41:13.164 --> 02:41:16.467 region:rollup2
STATES THOUGH IT HAD BETTER

02:41:14.665 --> 02:41:19.236 region:rollup2
SYSTEMS IN PLACE THAN OTHERS

02:41:16.467 --> 02:41:20.838 region:rollup2

EARTHQUAKES.

02:42:24.969 --> 02:42:28.706 region:rollup2
SO THE SYSTEM WILL GO DOWN

02:42:26.870 --> 02:42:30.474 region:rollup2
VENTURE THE CELL TOWERS NAM

02:42:28.706 --> 02:42:31.642 region:rollup2
LINES INTERNET. IS DURING AWAY

02:42:30.474 --> 02:42:33.711 region:rollup2
WE CAN GO TO MAINTAIN

02:42:31.642 --> 02:42:34.278 region:rollup2

CAN WE MAINTAIN. COMMUNICATION

02:42:38.148 --> 02:42:43.354 region:rollup2
WITH OF ALL SYSTEMS GO DOWN IS

02:42:41.318 --> 02:42:43.921 region:rollup2
OR SOME TYPE OF BACKUP PLAN.

02:42:43.354 --> 02:42:44.221 region:rollup2
I KNOW WE WE TALK ABOUT THEY

02:42:43.921 --> 02:42:47.091 region:rollup2

BUT THE MEANTIME AND

02:42:49.393 --> 02:42:51.895 region:rollup2
EVERYTHING'S WIPED OUT BECAUSE

02:42:51.362 --> 02:42:53.764 region:rollup2
OF THE FIRE THE FLUTTERED

02:42:51.895 --> 02:42:54.264 region:rollup2
EARTHQUAKE.

02:42:53.764 --> 02:42:54.965 region:rollup2
IS OUR WAY WE CAN STILL

HAPPEN BUT I ASSURE YOU THAT

02:43:10.714 --> 02:43:13.984 region:rollup2
AGAIN.

02:43:11.448 --> 02:43:15.352 region:rollup2
THOSE NEGOTIATING ON BEHALF OF

02:43:13.984 --> 02:43:17.221 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA CERTAINLY ARE TRYING

02:43:15.352 --> 02:43:19.189 region:rollup2
TO ANTICIPATE THE MANY DISASTERS

02:43:17.221 --> 02:43:19.723 region:rollup2
THAT CAN AND WILL ACCORD HAVE

02:43:19.189 --> 02:43:20.924 region:rollup2
OCCURRED IN THE STATE OF

02:43:19.723 --> 02:43:22.326 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA.

02:43:20.924 --> 02:43:23.694 region:rollup2
WE'VE BEEN WORKING VERY CLOSELY

HAND IN GLOVE WITH THEM FOR A

02:43:23.694 --> 02:43:27.064 region:rollup2
NUMBER OF YEARS AND CONTINUE TO

02:43:25.729 --> 02:43:28.832 region:rollup2
WORK WITH THEM GOING FOR IT AND

02:43:27.064 --> 02:43:30.200 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE WORK SOME OF THE THE

02:43:28.832 --> 02:43:31.235 region:rollup2
HARDENING THAT A SENATOR

02:43:30.200 --> 02:43:32.970 region:rollup2
JACKSON'S JUST MENTIONED IS

02:43:31.235 --> 02:43:34.772 region:rollup2
BEING DONE THAT HELPS THAT'S

02:43:32.970 --> 02:43:36.507 region:rollup2
PART OF THE SOLUTION. PART OF

02:43:34.772 --> 02:43:38.475 region:rollup2
THE SOLUTION ALSO NEGOTIATED BY

02:43:36.507 --> 02:43:40.344 region:rollup2
YOUR REPRESENTATIVES A CALLER WE

02:43:38.475 --> 02:43:42.546 region:rollup2
ASK AS A LARGER.

02:43:40.344 --> 02:43:45.516 region:rollup2
NUMBER OF DEPLOYED UNITS.

02:43:42.546 --> 02:43:48.185 region:rollup2
THE AND AND MOST STATES HAVE

02:43:45.516 --> 02:43:49.286 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDING THE PROPENSITY FOR

02:43:48.185 --> 02:43:51.755 region:rollup2
NATURAL DISASTERS HERE IN

02:43:49.286 --> 02:43:54.491 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA SO THAT'S ANOTHER WAY

02:43:51.755 --> 02:43:56.927 region:rollup2
OF LOOKING AT THE RESILIENCY OF

02:43:54.491 --> 02:43:59.196 region:rollup2
THE NETWORK TO ENSURE THAT TIME

02:43:56.927 --> 02:44:01.432 region:rollup2
DOUBT IS MINIMIZE. ANOTHER THAT

02:43:59.196 --> 02:44:03.567 region:rollup2
AGAIN YOUR NEGOTIATORS ARE ARE

02:44:01.432 --> 02:44:06.303 region:rollup2
ARE AYE I'VE BEEN SUPPORTING AS

02:44:03.567 --> 02:44:06.804 region:rollup2
WELL IS ADDITIONAL.

SUPPORT.

02:44:06.804 --> 02:44:12.743 region:rollup2
GENERATORS AROUND NETWORKED AYE

02:44:10.674 --> 02:44:14.311 region:rollup2
EQUIPMENT THAT WE'RE WORKING

02:44:12.743 --> 02:44:16.547 region:rollup2
WITH THEM ON AS WELL SO THERE

02:44:14.311 --> 02:44:18.515 region:rollup2
ARE A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT.

02:44:16.547 --> 02:44:21.018 region:rollup2
ALTERNATIVES IN ADDITION TO

02:44:18.515 --> 02:44:23.220 region:rollup2
JUST BUILDING OUT MORE CAPACITY

02:44:21.018 --> 02:44:26.290 region:rollup2
IN GENERAL THESE ALL WORK

02:44:23.220 --> 02:44:29.860 region:rollup2
TOGETHER IN COMBINATION TO

02:44:26.290 --> 02:44:32.896 region:rollup2
ENSURE THAT OUT ITS TIMES ARE

02:44:29.860 --> 02:44:35.532 region:rollup2
CUT TO AN ANIMAL. CAN WE ENSURE

02:44:32.896 --> 02:44:38.569 region:rollup2
THAT THERE IS NEVER EVER GOING

02:44:35.532 --> 02:44:40.337 region:rollup2
TO BE AN OUTAGE KNOW WHAT WE CAN

02:44:38.569 --> 02:44:42.906 region:rollup2
ENSURE THAT WHEN WE DO HAVE AN

02:44:40.337 --> 02:44:44.041 region:rollup2
OUTAGE IT'S GOING TO BE AS

02:44:42.906 --> 02:44:48.212 region:rollup2
MINIMAL AS POSSIBLE AND

02:44:44.041 --> 02:44:48.579 region:rollup2
IMPACTING THE PUBLIC SAFETY OF

THE COMMUNITY.

02:44:48.579 --> 02:44:49.480 region:rollup2
AND WITHOUT SAID IS OUR WAY WE

02:44:49.246 --> 02:44:51.715 region:rollup2
COULD.

02:44:49.480 --> 02:44:52.750 region:rollup2
MINIMIZE THAT IMPACT OR WE HAVE.

02:44:51.715 --> 02:44:53.617 region:rollup2
MAYBE SOME CERTAIN TYPES OF

02:44:52.750 --> 02:44:54.251 region:rollup2
GUIDELINES THAT WITHIN. AN AREA

02:44:53.617 --> 02:44:54.952 region:rollup2
THAT WHEN EVERYTHING GOES DOWN

02:44:54.251 --> 02:44:56.220 region:rollup2
WORST CASE SCENARIO THAT. WITHIN

AND BACK UP GENERATOR TIME.

02:45:13.504 --> 02:45:17.708 region:rollup2
YEAH HOW LONG WILL IT HOW WE'RE

02:45:15.672 --> 02:45:19.710 region:rollup2

INSTANCE OF COURSE IN INSTANCES

02:45:19.710 --> 02:45:23.147 region:rollup2
WHERE THE ENTIRE ENTIRE TOWERS

NORTHEASTERN CALIFORNIA.

02:45:55.045 --> 02:45:57.948 region:rollup2
TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND SQUARE

02:45:56.046 --> 02:45:59.183 region:rollup2
MILES.

02:45:57.948 --> 02:46:02.019 region:rollup2
THAT'S ALMOST SEVEN TIMES CITED

02:45:59.183 --> 02:46:04.988 region:rollup2
SIZE LA COUNTY GEOGRAPHICALLY.

02:46:02.019 --> 02:46:05.489 region:rollup2

WILDFIRE EXPOSURE LOT OF

02:46:05.489 --> 02:46:10.227 region:rollup2
FORESTS.

02:46:08.692 --> 02:46:11.628 region:rollup2
AND SO I'M JUST TRYING TO GET.

02:46:10.227 --> 02:46:14.631 region:rollup2
CLARITY IN TERMS OF THE

02:46:11.628 --> 02:46:15.532 region:rollup2
HARDENING ASPECT.

02:46:14.631 --> 02:46:16.700 region:rollup2
WOULD YOU MIND EXPANDING A

02:46:15.532 --> 02:46:18.168 region:rollup2
LITTLE BIT IN TERMS OF WHAT THAT

02:46:16.700 --> 02:46:19.169 region:rollup2
MEANS AND THEN.

02:46:18.168 --> 02:46:20.971 region:rollup2
IS THERE ALSO GOING TO BE.

02:46:19.169 --> 02:46:22.005 region:rollup2
.

02:46:20.971 --> 02:46:24.208 region:rollup2
MORE MORE BUT DEFAULT.

02:46:22.005 --> 02:46:25.976 region:rollup2
.

02:46:24.208 --> 02:46:27.811 region:rollup2
FEATURE SO THAT IN THE EVENT

02:46:25.976 --> 02:46:28.612 region:rollup2
THAT YOU HAVE.

02:46:27.811 --> 02:46:30.280 region:rollup2
A TARA GO DOWN.

02:46:28.612 --> 02:46:32.082 region:rollup2
.

02:46:30.280 --> 02:46:34.685 region:rollup2
WE MIGHT HAVE MORE MORE TOWERS

02:46:32.082 --> 02:46:36.753 region:rollup2
PER SQUARE MILE OR WHATEVER.

02:46:34.685 --> 02:46:38.188 region:rollup2
SO THAT IN THE EVENT YOU HAVE A

02:46:36.753 --> 02:46:40.224 region:rollup2
A SMALLER REGIONAL FIRE.

02:46:38.188 --> 02:46:41.758 region:rollup2
YOU STILL HAVE COMMUNICATION

02:46:40.224 --> 02:46:42.960 region:rollup2
ABILITY.

02:46:41.758 --> 02:46:44.661 region:rollup2
BECAUSE.

02:46:42.960 --> 02:46:46.830 region:rollup2
OF THE DIP HAVE.

02:46:44.661 --> 02:46:48.699 region:rollup2
NATURE OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE.

02:46:46.830 --> 02:46:49.399 region:rollup2
SURE CHERISH THE GAINES I THINK

02:46:48.699 --> 02:46:51.134 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE.

02:46:49.399 --> 02:46:53.303 region:rollup2
I THINK GOT SENATOR JACKSON USE

02:46:51.134 --> 02:46:56.106 region:rollup2
THE TERM.

02:46:53.303 --> 02:46:57.841 region:rollup2
.

02:46:56.106 --> 02:46:58.876 region:rollup2
WHEN I GO I USE THE TERM HARDING

02:46:57.841 --> 02:47:00.210 region:rollup2
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PUBLIC

02:46:58.876 --> 02:47:01.612 region:rollup2
SAFETY GREAT I THINK SENATOR

02:47:00.210 --> 02:47:02.813 region:rollup2
JACKSON USE THAT TERM.

02:47:01.612 --> 02:47:04.381 region:rollup2
THOSE ARE THE KINDS OF THINGS

02:47:02.813 --> 02:47:05.949 region:rollup2
YES WE'RE NEGOTIATING WITH CAL

02:47:04.381 --> 02:47:07.451 region:rollup2
WE ASKED TO ENSURE THAT AT LEAST

02:47:05.949 --> 02:47:09.052 region:rollup2
IN PARTICULAR AREAS WHERE THEY

02:47:07.451 --> 02:47:10.721 region:rollup2
BELIEVE THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT

02:47:09.052 --> 02:47:12.222 region:rollup2
VULNERABILITIES YES.

02:47:10.721 --> 02:47:13.056 region:rollup2
WE'RE GOING TO WE'RE GOING TO

02:47:12.222 --> 02:47:14.992 region:rollup2
LOOK AT.

02:47:13.056 --> 02:47:16.727 region:rollup2
HARDENING IN THAT FASHION THEIR

02:47:14.992 --> 02:47:17.895 region:rollup2
AND THEIR NUMBER OF WAYS WHEN WE

02:47:16.727 --> 02:47:19.429 region:rollup2
TALK ABOUT HARDENING.

02:47:17.895 --> 02:47:21.999 region:rollup2
IT IT IT IT.

02:47:19.429 --> 02:47:22.633 region:rollup2
THAT SIMPLY MEANS THAT THEIR

02:47:21.999 --> 02:47:24.868 region:rollup2
HOURS.
