THERE ARE. THE LEGISLATURE LOSS WHEN THEY'RE OWNS- CATULUS IGN LAST WEEK AND THERE'S A FUNERAL THAT'S HAPPENING SOLD A COUPLE OF OUR MEMBERS ARE AWAY AND GIVEN THE- HEALTH CARE CONCERNS AND OTHER MEMBERS AWAY SO WE WILL PROCEED AS A SUBCOMMITTEE THIS MORNING- ON ALL MATTERS I'VE ALSO MADE THE DECISION THAT WE WILL HOLD OPEN ALL OUR- MATTERS BEFORE US. AND AT THIS TIME. MOVING OVERTURE FOLLOWING HEARING SO THOSE WHO WERE ON. THE ADMINISTRATION RESPECTING QUICK APPROVAL ON SOME OF THE MATTERS WHICH IS AS A COURTESY TO EVERYBODY GIVEN THIS UNUSUAL SITUATION THAT WE'RE IN THIS MORNING THE WHOLE THING'S OPEN. WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO MOVE TO THE VOTE ONLY CALENDAR- WE'RE NOT TAKING ANY ACTION TODAY BUT IF THERE'S MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC THAT ARE HERE I LIKE TO OPEN THE PUBLIC. HEARING ON THAT. OKAY THURSDAY WAS CLOSE THE PUBLIC HEARING WE WILL CONTINUE- THAT THE MATTERS FOR. VOTE ONLY AT A LATER DATE SO LET'S MOVE TO A DISCUSSION I ITEMS AND LET'S BRING UP- CALTRANS FOR THIS IS ISSUE NUMBER ELEVEN LA LA. WE'LL HEAR ABOUT OUR LOCAL AIRPORT LOAN ACCOUNT IN THE- THEY'RE NOT X. ACCOUNT GOOD MORNING. GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING. THANK YOU UGH GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN THANKS FOR HAVING THE DEPARTMENT HERE THIS MORNING CALTRANS IN- MEMBER STERN THANKS FOR GIVING US THIS OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT. A FEW ITEMS ON ARE A FEW ITEMS ON OUR BUDGET. ALL START WITH THE AIRPORT IMPROVEMENT GRANT- MATCHING FUNDS THE PARCHMENT OF TRANSPORTATION REQUEST A TEN MILLION DOLLAR IN A FUND TRANSFER. OF TWO POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY OVER FOUR YEARS FOR THE LOCAL AIRPORT LOAN ACCOUNT TO THE AERONAUTICS AGO. THE TRANSFER WILL PROVIDE AN INCREASED ANNUAL LOCAL ASSISTANCE FUNDING CAPACITY OF TWO POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS TO FUND THE AIRPORT. IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM MATCHING GRANT PROGRAM. THE TO. ON THE AIRPORT. HELLO GIVE ANY COMMENTS ON A THE UNDER UTILIZE FUN. HI IAN THIS ROW WITH THE LA L. SO WE HAVE NO CONCERNS REGARDING THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE ALLOWING TO SEE TFA TO COLLECT THE FUEL TAX- DATA BECAUSE THIS WILL ULTIMATELY HELP THE STATE GATHER INFORMATION TO COMPLY WITH THE FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS- AS FOR THE REQUEST TO TRANSFER FUNDS- FROM TE LOAN ACCOUNT TO THE AERONAUTICS ACCOUNT WE FOUND THE PROPOSED TO BE REASONABLE. AND THERE SEEMS TO BE FLEXIBILITY IN THE AMOUNT THE ADMINISTRATION CAN TRANSFER FROM THE LOAN ACCOUNT TO THE AERONAUTICS ACCOUNT IF THE TWO POINT FIVE MILLION IS INSUFFICIENT IF THE DEMAND- IS GREATER THAN THAT- HOWEVER THE LEGISLATURE MAY WANT TO- MY VISIT IN FUTURE. IF THAT HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND CAP FOR THE GROUP- THE GRANT IS. YEAH EVERYBODY HERE THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE WILL BE HEARD AND SUB FOR FIRST STEP TO BUT IT'S GOOD TO HAVE THE INFORMATION WHAT I DO. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE FEDERAL MATCH IS ON THE- NAM X. ACCOUNT MISTER DIRECTOR IN WHAT THAT POTENTIAL IS FOR. THESE AIRPORTS TO ACTUALLY UTILIZE THE FUNDS TO DO THE IMPROVEMENTS THAT WE THINK SHOULD BE DONE. YEAH I WAS GERMAN I DON'T HAVE THE DETAILS- ON ON THE FAA GRANTS. YOU KNOW WHAT THE MATCHING REQUIREMENT IS THE- FEDERAL GRANTS TYPICALLY REQUIRE AN EIGHTY TWENTY EIGHTY- EIGHTY TWENTY- MATCH. AND FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND WE HAVE NOT BEEN. MEETING SOME OF THOSE- SOME OF THOSE MATCH REQUIREMENTS WERE LEAVING SOME FEDERAL MONEY- ON THE TABLE AND SALAS ON THIS- ADDITIONAL FUNDING WILL GIVE US THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE ABLE TO MATCH THOSE. TO MATCH THOSE GRANTS- AS NEEDED THE PROJECTS TYPICALLY RANGE IN A HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLAR RANGE OF THE GROUP THE GRANTS. THAT WE DO SO THIS WILL THIS WILL ALLOW US TO BE ABLE TO- TO PROVIDE THOSE BILLS MATCHING FUNDS AS NEEDED FOR THOSE GROUNDS ANYTHING ELSE AT FINANCE. SURE JAMES WHERE THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SO- THE WAY THAT THE- AIRPORT IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM WORKS AT THE FAA LEVEL IS THAT THE- ENTITIES THE LOCAL AIRPORTS APPLY DIRECTLY NOT THROUGH THE STATE TO THE FAA. THE FAA PROVIDES 90% OF THE PRODUCT AMOUNT AND THE STATE HAS TO THE LOCAL ENTITY COMES UP WITH TEN PERCENT. THE ADMINISTRATION HAS MADE A COMMITMENT TO HELP WITH THAT 10% MATCH BY FUNDING 5% AND THEN THE LOCAL AIRPORT HAS COME UP WITH THE OTHER FIVE PERCENT. ON THEPROPOSAL THAT WE HAVE- IN IN FRONT OF YOU IS TO. THE SUIT CONTINUE THE A HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLAR MATCH WHICH ALLOWS NINETY PLUS PERCENT OF THE PROJECTS TO GET THE FULL 5% FROM THE STATE- THIS TWO POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS WOULD HELP. MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN PROVIDE THAT 5% UP TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND- AS ELLIE- NOTED THERE IS EXISTING STATUTORY AUTHORITY THAT WOULD ALLOW US TO TRANSFER MORE MONEY FROM THE LAW ALLOWED TO THE AND OTHERS ACCOUNT. IF THAT TWO POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS WAS INSUFFICIENT- IT'S BEEN OUR PRACTICE THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS TO TRANSFER USING EXECUTIVE ORDERS. ENOUGH TO FIND THAT 5% UP TO WHATEVER THE CAP IS AND WE WOULD CONTINUE TO DO THAT IF THE TWO POINT FIVE- IS INSUFFICIENT. AND PRESUMABLY IN THE AIRPORT WORLD THEY WOULD KNOW THAT WE'VE MADE A FOR YOUR COMMITMENT SO THAT THEY'RE PLANNING WOULD BEREFLECTIVE OF THAT IN GOING OUT AND SEEKING THE FEDERAL SYSTEMS. THAT'S GREAT YOU'RE THINKING THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY WE DIDN'T JUST CONTINUE WITH AD HOC EXECUTIVE ORDERS EACH YEAR WE WANTED TO LAY OUT- SOME STABILITY TO SIGNAL TO THE- INDUSTRY THAT THERE WAS. A COMMITMENT ONGOING. CENTER STERN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. QUICK CLARIFYING QUESTION- JUSTIN ARE THERE PENDING APPLICATIONS ARE FOR THE DIRECTOR OR FOR DEAL WEAPON ARE THERE PENDING APPLICATIONS FOR MANY CALIFORNIA AIRPORTS TOWARDS THE FEDERAL PROGRAM RIGHT NOW THAT YOU GUYS ARE SORT OF LOOKING AHEAD AT DO YOU ANTICIPATE. ANY SPECIFIC TYPES OF PROJECTS COMING OVER THE NEXT FOUR YEARS I KNOW I'VE HAD CONVERSATIONS WITH LA ACTS AS A MAJOR OVERHAUL GOING ON AS A PH<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt;ND I'M JUST TRYING TO&lt;/c&gt;</u> RIGHTS AS MY OWN EXPECTATIONS FOR WHAT WHAT WHAT COULD WE SEE COMING OUT OF THIS AERONAUTICS ON IN ORDER TO QUALIFY IT LEAST IN ORDER TO QUALIFY FOR THE STATE'S MATCHING- A PART OF THE AP GRANT. THE IT HAS TO BE THE PROJECT HAS TO BE PART OF THE- CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PLAN TO SIMPLY A TEN YEAR IMPROVEMENT PLAN THERE'S CURRENTLY ABOUT SIX BILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF PROJECTS ON THAT PLAN AND- SINCE. THE AIRPORTS THE QUALIFY FOR THE STATE'S MATCHING PART THE GENERAL AVIATION AND THE RELIEVER AIRPORTS THERE'S ABOUT THREE BILLION DOLLARS FOR THE PROJECTS UNDER THOSE UNDER THAT SUB CATEGORY OF THOSE SO- SO THERE'S A LOT OF PROJECTS THAT ARE THAT ARE ON THEM PER PLAN THAN THAT ARE ESSENTIALLY AVAILABLE FOR WHATEVER FUNDING IS MADE AVAILABLE BY THE FEDS. AND THE DEFENSE ARE REALLY THE TRIGGER HERE WE JUST FOLLOW ON SO WE'RE SORT OF WAITING ON THE F. A. DEPENDING ON HOW THEY WANT TO CORRECT THE ANNUALLY THERE'S A THERE'S A NATIONAL BUDGET OF THREE POINT ONE BILLION DOLLARS AND- THAT'S MADE AVAILABLE FOR THE PROGRAM AND THERE'S- MOST A LARGE PERCENTAGE OF THE GRANTS OURS ESSENTIALLY ALLOCATED TO THE STATE'S INTO THE AIRPORTS IN THE STATE'S BASED ON- TRAFFIC THE AFTER AVERAGE DAILY PASSENGER VOLUME AND YOU KNOW IT'S A LOT OF METRICS. THAT THAT THEY PUT ALL TOGETHER AND THEY COME UP WITH A NUMBER IN THE STATE GENERALLY. YOUNG STATE CALIFORNIA GENERALLY GETS. TWO HUNDRED AND- TO TWO HUNDRED NINETY MILLION A PER YEAR BASED ON FAT FORMULA. AND THEN IF THERE'S ADDITIONAL FUNDS AVAILABLE OUT OF THE THREE POINT ONE BILLION OR- OR THAT THE OTHER THREE WOMEN OR IF THERE'S ADDITIONAL- APPROPRIATIONS MADE THAN THOSE THAT MONEY GOES INTO- DISCRETIONARY FUND AND THAT'S BASED ON WHAT'S- YOU GIVE IN. DIDN'T WE LIKE SO WE HAVE OUR% LIST OF WE HAVE OUR CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PLAN LIST OF PROJECTS AND ALL OF THOSE CAN BE. PART OF. THE LAST QUESTION JUST I KNOW I'VE HEARD A DISTINCT. CONCERN RELEASE FROM A FEW MAJOR AIRPORTS ABOUT THEIR FUELING INFRASTRUCTURE. AND THE NEED. UNDER THE NEW LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD FRAMEWORK WHERE THEY'RE ACTUALLY PRODUCING AND UTILIZING LIKE SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS TO NEWER NOBLE JET FUEL AS WELL AS WELL AS RENEWABLE THESE ON SITE AND ALSO CHARGING. INFRASTRUCTURE AND THEY'VE THEY'VE INQUIRED ABOUT HOW TO. SORT OF FINANCE THAT AND I DIDN'T KNOW IS THAT KIND OF CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT SHOULD THEY WANT TO PUT IT INTO THIS FRAMEWORK IS THAT KIND OF THING ELIGIBLE LIKE A FUELING INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENT A STORAGE CAPACITY ON SITE. THE BEST OF MY KNOWLEDGE THOSE TO BE ELIGIBLE PROJECTS AND THERE'S A THERE'S A LONG LIST OF VERY INTRICATE THINGS BUT I MEAN I DON'T KNOW OF ANY REASON WHY THOSE TYPE PROJECT. THANK YOU. ONE THING THAT I WOULD LIKE TO POINT OUT SENATOR CENTERS THAT AS FAR AS OUR MATCHING. PROGRAM GOES FROM THE STATE- BECAUSE ITS MAIN FOCUS IS TO HELP MOSTLY SMALLER AIRPORTS. PERFORM TRANSPONDER PROJECTS WITH A MINIMAL INVESTMENT PLACES LIKE LA ACTS AND AS OF ANOTHER COMMERCIAL AIRPORTS ARE NOT RECEIVING A MATCHING FUNDS FROM THE STATE THIS IS REALLY DESIGNED ABOUT THE SMALLER RURAL GENERAL AVIATION AND SOME RELIEVER AIRPORTS VERY GOOD THANK YOU FOR THE CLARIFICATION ARTLESS OPEN UP THE PUBLIC HEARING THIS IS ISSUE NUMBER SEVEN AIRPORT IMPROVEMENT GRANT MATCHING. FUND WE'LL CLOSE PUBLIC HEARING AND WE'RE GOING TO HOLD THIS MATTER OPEN- LET'S MOVE TO THE LITTERBOX EVIDENTLY HAVE A VERY. IT'S A GROWING LETTER BACK PROBLEM THIS IS ISSUE NUMBER EIGHT ON ABATEMENT. PLEASE PROCEED DIRECTOR YES THE GERMAN THANK YOU- UNFORTUNATELY WE DO AND SO THE DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION IS REQUEST IN AN INCREASE OF. THIRTY ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS IN TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE. INCREASING TO A PERMANENT INCREASE OF FORTY THREE POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS AND TWENTY TWENTY FOUR TO TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. FOR THE DIVISION OF MAINTENANCE TO FUND THE LATER ABATEMENT PROGRAM. HIGHWAY LITTERING ILLEGAL DUMPING IS GROWING SUS IS A GROWN SOCIETAL CONCERN. THAT PLAGUES THE TRAVELING PUBLIC AND THE CITIZENS OF CALIFORNIA. THE LETTER ABATEMENT PROGRAM IS DESIGNED TO REMOVE LETTER THROUGHOUT THE STATE. EXISTING LEVEL OF RESOURCES CANNOT ADDRESS THE INCREASED VOLUME OF HIGHLY LETTER ANY ILLEGAL DUMPING. AND CAN'T MAKE CLEANUP SERVICES OR SPECIALIZED SERVICES FROM WATER CLEAN UP CONCERNS ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THIS REQUEST. THE REQUEST PROVIDES A PERMANENT INCREASE IN DEDICATED RESOURCES TO IMPROVE LATER BUT MAN ON THE STATE HIGHWAY SYSTEM. THANK CHAIRMAN. THAT INTERACT WITH THOSE ALTHOUGH SIGNS WE SAY THIS STRUCTURE HIGHWAYS BEING SERVICED BY ABC CORPORATION WHAT'S THE INTERPLAY BETWEEN THOSE PEOPLE AND THIS 40% INCREASE THAT YOU HAVE ON SERVICE REQUEST I SUMA SERVICE REQUEST IS SOMEBODY SOME GOOD NEIGHBOR CALLS UP AND SAYS HEY THERE'S A MATTRESS ON- STATE ROUTE ONE SIXTEEN OF OR WHATEVER IT IS AND- THOSE HAVE. INCREASE DO YOU GUYS CALL HEY. ABC CORPORATION GO GET THAT MATTRESS IT'S THIS IS YOUR PART OF THE HIGHWAY OR DO YOU GUYS GO OUT. ALTHOUGH AS IT WERE THAT THAT'S A THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION I MEAN THAT'S A COMPLETELY SEPARATE- PROGRAMME GERMAN- THE ADOPT A HIGHWAY PROGRAM IS ROUGHLY. WERE SICK WERE REDUCING THE NUMBERS WRONG FOR ROUGHLY FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS IS HOW MUCH THAT'S COSTING US TO DO THAT PROGRAM. THAT'S A COMPLETELY SEPARATE FROM THE COSTS THAT WERE SEEN- WITHIN THE MAINTENANCE DIVISION ON ON LETTER PICK UP AND CABINET RELATED ISSUES RIGHT NOW ROUGHLY A HUNDRED A HUNDRED AND TWO MILLION DOLLARS JUST AND DOING CLEAN UPS AND- WORKING ON IN COMMENTS IN CLEAN UP LITTER SO WE'VE GOT. THAT A MIX CHALLENGE IN FRONT OF US AS RELATES TO THIS OUR OUR MAINTENANCE FORCES ARE INCREASINGLY HAVING TO ADDRESS ISSUES RELATED TO- BUT THE HOUSING ON AND SHELTERED BUT THE VOLUNTEER EFFORTS THAT YOU'RE YOU YOU MENTION ARE DEFINITELY HELP US I MEAN IT'S GOOD TO HAVE COMPANIES- VOLUNTEER OUR TIME- ANYA FORCES TO HELP US OUT WITH THIS WITH THESE EFFORTS BUT TWO SEPARATE PROGRAMS. IF YOU WILL. SAME LATER SO THE SO THE ADOPT A HIGHWAY PROGRAM HAS SOME SORT OF FIXED FREQUENCY THE PEOPLE GO OUT THAT THE YOU KNOW IT IN ORDER TO GE YOUR NAME ON THE HIGHWAY THAT YOU'RE GOOD YOU'RE GOOD CITIZEN YOU GOT TO IT ONCE A YEAR TWICE A YEAR SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND WE STILL HAVE SEEN. IN THE LAST FOUR YEARS AS LITTER ON THE ON THE ROADS RIGHT SO THE CONSUMER IS MORE OF A LITTER BUG THE ADOPTED AND WE ALWAYS THOUGHT I ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT THESE ADOPTED LATER ADOPTED FREEWAY PROGRAM STARTED JUST TOOK CARE OF ALL YOUR WORK JUSTIN MAGICALLY DISAPPEARED. IN LA- YOU HAVE ANY OF LITTER. A PERSPECTIVES TODAY RECOMMEND IS AT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE- WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE APPROVED THE PROPOSAL TO AUGMENT FUNDING FOR CALTRAIN DOES LITTER ABATEMENT SERVICES- THERE ARE ASSESSMENT WE FIND THE DATA DEBT DEMONSTRATES THAT THE VOLUME OF TRASH ON THE STATE HIGHWAY SYSTEM HAS RISEN SIGNIFICANTLY IN AND AS A RESULT IN ADDITIONAL- WORKLOAD FOR CALTRANS. WE FIND THAT THESE CONDITIONS ARE LIKELY TO PERSIST WHICH WARRANT THE AUGMENTATION. HOWEVER WE ALSO RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE ADOPTS SUPPLEMENTAL REPORTING LANGUAGE REQUIRING CALTRANS TO PROVIDE AN ASSESSMENT OF THE GROWING LITTER ISSUE- IN CONVERSATIONS WITH THE DEPARTMENT. IT SEEMED AS THOUGH THEY DON'T HAVE A CLEAR INDICATION ON WHAT THE DRIVERS WERE. AND WE BELIEVE HAVING SUCH INFORMATION COULD ASSIST THE STATE AND FINING EFFECTIVE STRATEGIES TO PREVENT LITTER IN THE LONG RUN. AS YOU MAY KNOW WHAT THE DRIVERS ARE HE JUST DON'T KNOW TO THE DEGREE IS IT IS IT ILLEGAL DUMPING IS IT JUST PEOPLE THROWING OUT THERE THERE. DRINKS OUT THE WINDOW OR YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN WE WOULD PROBABLY KNOW THE COLUMNS ARE THAT THERE THAT HEY THE I. OPPORTUNITIES- THAT PEOPLE HAVE. ANYTHING TO ADD. I THINK THAT THE ADMINISTRATION WOULD BE HAPPY TO WORK WITH- YOUR STAFF TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE THE INFORMATION THAT YOU NEED. SERVICE RUNNING WHAT THE CAUSES ARE OF THERE THERE IS SOME EXISTING REPORTS A CALTRANS AS PUT OUT THAT TOUCHES ON SOME OF THESE ISSUES AND SO WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO DIRECT YOU TO THEM TO SATISFY WHATEVER- NEED YOU HAVE AS FAR AS LEARNING ABOUT. THE RESOURCES BUT WE CAN WORK WITH YOU TO PROVIDE THE- CENTER STERN. THANKS MISTER CHAIR AND- I REALLY APPRECIATE. THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL HERE AND THE PRODUCTIVITY ON YOUR PART. PILING UP FOR A LONG TIME THIS ISSUE AND- IT IT DESERVES LEVEL SERIOUSNESS SITE I WOULD CONCUR WITH THE LAOWES ANALYSIS FOR APPROVAL I DID WANT TO ASK THE JUST FROM THE INITIAL DATA YOU HAVE- HOT SPOTS THAT YOU'RE SEEING I MEAN DO YOU DO AS HAVE SORT OF BEEN GEOGRAPHIC INTENSITY AREAS- AT THIS POINT LOOK WHAT IS THE MAP LOOK LIKE STATEWIDE. WELL EXCUSE ME IF THE THAT THE GREAT QUESTIONS TO STERN OF GILBERT THAT RESPONSE THE DIVISIONAL BUT JUST ACTING CHIEF- RIGHT NOW TO OUR MAINTENANCE PROGRAM. THE WAY WE IDENTIFY THE NEEDS BASS ON LEVEL OF SERVICE AND WE IDENTIFY ALL THE CUSTOMER SERVICE REQUEST THAT WE RECEIVE STATEWIDE- DETERMINE THE PRIORITY AS FAR AS WHERE THE LITTER IS. AND WHAT TYPE OF PRIVATIZATION IS GOING TO BE GIVEN TO THOSE AREAS TO BE PICKED UP. THE LETTER IS STATEWIDE THE MORE URBAN AREAS THE DUKE CONGREGATE LIVING MORE LITTER PC. BASED ON THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE LIVING IN THOSE SITUATIONS WE'RE SEEING A LOT A LITTLE WITHIN THE RURAL AREAS AS WELL. WE ARE TRYING TO IDENTIFY SPECIFICALLY TO BE TO THE LA THOSE CONCERNS AS FOR THE TYPE LEADERS GOING THERE HOW IT'S GETTING THERE. AND THE TYPE OF POCKETS ARE GONNA BE TAKING TO REMOVE THAT LATER- BUT PRIMARILY. WE PRIORITIZE THE WORKLOAD BASED ON THE CUSTOMER SERVICE REQUEST THAT WE DO RECEIVE A STATEWIDE AND THEN FROM THERE WE IDENTIFY THAT THAT WORKS. NO THE MAINTENANCE CREW THAT WOULD BE USED AS A REQUEST DRIVEN I MEAN DOES IT COME TOP DOWN FROM YOUR ANALYSIS AND THAT SORT OF COMBINES WITH REQUESTS FROM THE GROUND OR IS IT COMING MOSTLY YOU EVALUATE. LIKE THE SQUEAKY IS WE'LL IS GOING TO GET THE ATTENTION BECAUSE IT'S SORT OF. IT'S REALLY BASED ON. REGIONAL REQUEST. YEAH IT IS A COMBINATION OF BOTH- BECAUSE WE HAVE A LEVEL SCORE STATEWIDE FOR EACH OF OUR DISTRICTS. AND WHEN THOSE REQUESTS COMMAND WE IDENTIFIED THE NEED BASED ON THE LITTLE CREW THAT WE ALREADY HAVE IN THOSE AREAS AND THE COMBINATION THAT INFORMATION. DRIVES IT AND IS THERE ANYTHING WE CAN DO I KNOW. YOU SAID- DIRECTOR THIS IS SEPARATE FROM IN CANTON ISSUES OR THIS IS GOING TO. THIS ACTUALLY ALLOWS FOR SOARED ANCILLARY CLEAN UP AROUND. IT DOES IT DOES SO I KNOW THERE'S COMPLEXITY TO THAT WORK AND A LOT OF IT FALLS ON YOUR FOLKS. TO NAVIGATE THE LEGAL COMPLEXITIES- EVERYONE LOVES DLE CALTRANS ABOUT WHAT THINGS LOOK LIKE UNDER THE FREEWAY BUT NO ONE REALLY HAS THE SAME TOOLS THAT YOU DO TO ACTUALLY GO TACKLE IT IS THERE ANYTHING WE CAN BE DOING TO- HELP YOU GUYS NAVIGATE THAT IS IT. DO YOU NEED MRE LOCAL PARTNERSHIPS LIKE WHAT WHAT. WHAT'S WHAT ARE MISSING PIECES HERE THAT WE CAN NAVIGATE SOME OF THE- LEGAL COMPLEXITIES AROUND THIS AND ALLOW YOU TO ACTUALLY. GET THE MONEY OUT THE DOOR BUT DOING IT OUT IN IT IN A WAY THAT'S HUMANE AND RECOGNIZING SOME OF THE CRISES WE HAVE I MEAN DO YOU DO. ARE YOU MISSING TOOLS RIGHT NOW OR- YOU KNOW. THE ALL HANDS ON DECK APPROACH THAT WE ARE WE'RE ALL USING THE- THE LEGISLATURE OF THE GOVERNOR'S THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND ALL THE STATE DEPARTMENT'S- I THINK IS THE APPROACH WE SHOULD BE. USING THE MORTAR THINGS WERE FOCUSED ON NOW IS GETTING MORE CITIES ACROSS THE STATE TO SIGN A LEASE AGREEMENT- WHAT WERE WERE POSSIBLE SO WE HAVE READY TO USE LEASE AGREEMENTS FOR CALTRANS IT'S- A PROPERTY COUNTY. RIGHT AWAY. SO FAR WE'VE ONLY GOT FIVE CITIES ON BOARD- THAT. IN WOULD RECALL SORRY TO INTERRUPT YOU BUT WITH. ONE OR TWO CITIES- SURE- SAN JOSE SACRAMENTO- OAKLAND- SERVICES GOING AND A LIABILITIES OKAY YEAH OF THE ONLY CITIES THAT WE HAVE A- ON A LEASE AGREEMENT WHAT TO USE- CALTRANS- RIGHT AWAY AND CALTRANS PARK PROPERTY. SO ENCOURAGING CITIES ACROSS THE STATE- MEMBERS OF CITIES THAT ARE IN YOUR IN YOUR DISTRICTS. WHERE THEY HAVE ISSUES. LAW TO WORK WITH US OWN AGREEMENT IS SOMETHING THAT WOULD WE WOULD STRONGLY LIKE YOUR HAVE YOUR HELP AND YOUR ASSISTANCE AND ENCOURAGEMENT. AND THIS IS THIS FOR COUNTIES TO WRITE A JOB SON INCORPORATED AREAS YOU NEED COUNTY BUYING BUT LA COUNTY SO FAR IS NOT OPTED INTO ANY SUCH LEASE AGREEMENT DON'T BELIEVE SO. I DON'T BELIEVE SO. AND IN THIS IN SEVEN CALIFORNIA SOUNDS LIKE ONLY CITY OF LOS ANGELES RIGHT NOW YES I THINK SO VERY GOOD THANKS TO GWEN AND ON A WRITER. THANK I HAVE THIS THURSDAY IF I CAN JUST CLARIFY TO PLEASE THIS PCP DOES NOT SPECIFICALLY ADDRESSING CABINETS OR WATER CLEAN UP SERVICES IS SHORTLY JUST FROM THE CRICKETS FOR LATER BUT- BUT I GUESS. READING INTO IT THERE THERE'S ALWAYS GOING TO. BE SORT OF ANCILLARY OR SORT OF. LEADER TO NOW. DIRECTED SPECIFICALLY AT. ENCAMPMENTS THE SENSE. AROUND WHAT THEY CALLED CLEARING WHICH IN SOME WAYS SO CASES ISN'T. ALLOWED IN- THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF LITIGATION THIS IS ABOUT SORT OF. MAKING IT AS CLEAN AS POSSIBLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES RIGHT OKAY WELL SO TO THE EXTENT YOU ALL NEED- IF FURTHER ASSISTANCE PLEASE LET US KNOW BECAUSE I KNOW IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. IT'S BECOMING A HUGE ISSUE BUT HOPEFULLY THIS PRODUCTIVITY WILL. START TO SHOW PROGRESS THIS YEAR AND GET THINGS OUT THE DOOR SO THANK YOU WE APPRECIATE AND CANDICE SO EVERYBODY'S CLEAR THE STORM WATER. LATER PIECES A SEPARATE. PIECE THAT'S GONNA COME LATER ON THAT. ONE FOLLOW UP QUESTION THIS IS. FORTY THREE MILLION THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY- THOUSAND. INCREASE OR PERMANENT INCREASED BY. TWENTY TWENTY FOUR TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. EXPLAIN TO US HOW THE WEEKEND MORE PROGRAM WORKS AND THE SEVERAL COUNTIES HAVE THE IN RATHER THAN DO IN ST JAIL TIME YOU CAN DO WE CAN WORK THEY PICK UP SOME LATER WHAT OF THE SIZE OF THE PROBLEM THAT YOU HAVE HOW MUCH OF THAT IS TAKING CARE CARE OF AND THEIR DAD WHAT'S THE POTENTIAL FOR THE NON PARTICIPATING COUNTIES. I GUESS IN THAT JAIL- THE SHARES DON'T WANT TO. PARTICIPATE IN A PROGRAM IN IN WHAT AMOUNTED THE BUDGET DO YOU NEED YOU KNOW IT'S THE SIX. FREE LABOR BUT YOU STILL HAVE TO HAVE SOME CALTRAIN PEOPLE OUT THERE. A DEALING WITH THAT. IF ANYBODY HAS HAS. SO WE DON'T HAVE ALL THE SPECIFICS OF THOSE QUESTIONS HOWEVER WE DO WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH THE VARIOUS COUNTIES IN DEPARTMENT CORRECTIONS ON THEIR- SPECIAL PROGRAM PEOPLE EFFORTS IN ORDER TO GET THOSE- INMATES IN ORDER TO HELP WITH THE CLEANUP SERVICES IT'S A VERY EFFECTIVE SYSTEM BECAUSE OF NOT ONLY TO HELP CLEAN UP THE HIGHWAY SYSTEM BUT WE ALSO USE- THERE THERE'S UP OUTSIDE BENEFITS TO WEAR. THE RECIDIVISM AS FAR AS THOSE IN MAYES OCCURRING- AS REDUCING THE SAVE THE STATE- APPROXIMATELY A HUNDRED TWENTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS NO JUST IN THOSE SITUATIONS BUT WE DO WORK WITH- THE ADOPT A HIGHWAY PROGRAM WITH- THE DHARMA CORRECTIONS AND THE CITIES AND COUNTIES WHEN THEY HAVE THOSE TYPE OF PROGRAMS IN ORDER TO HELP US WITH THE CLEAN UP ALONG WITH OUR MAINTENANCE CREWS AS FAR AS PICKING UP LITTER ALONG THE WAY ARE THERE ACTUALLY SHARE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND COUNTY SAID ON I PARTICIPATE IN THIS PROGRAM. THAT JUST SIMPLY SAY THEY'RE NOT GOING TO HELP US WITH THIS STATEWIDE PROP PROBLEM. THAT WE HAVE ANY. NOT AWARE THAT WE CAN WE CAN LOOK INTO THAT AND GET YOU THAT ANSWER YEAH I'D LIKE TO HAVE THAT LIST- PUBLICLY SO THAT WE CAN NO WHICH IT ITS SHARE OF CYNIC. IN THE DIFFERENT COUNTIES ARE JUST. YOU KNOW SAYING IT'S NOT MY PROBLEM. COULD WIN I'D LIKE TO SHARE THAT WITH THE CHAIR OF SUB FIVE WHEN THEY COME FOR MONEY FROM A- AID LEADER LETTER PICK UP STAND RIGHT USE AN INMATE'S TO. TO ASSESS WHAT THE RIGHT THING WITH THE HAVE YOU KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT. LOW MATH PROBLEM PEOPLE THAT JUST HAVE TO DO SOME YOU KNOW TEN OUT TEN DAYS OF COUNTY JAIL THEY CAN. THEY CAN SIGN UP FOR THE WEEKEND WORK PROGRAM SO THEY COME IN. ON SATURDAY AND SUNDAY THEY'RE DOING IT THEY CAN DO IT ANYTIME THEY DO A MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY OR AND- OR WHATEVER THAT IS BUT THAT SAID. I'D LET'S OPEN UP THE PUBLIC HEARING THIS IS ISSUE NUMBER EIGHT. AND LATER A BASEMENT. WITH CALTRANS. WE'LL CLOSE THE PUBLIC CAN WITHHOLD THAT MATTER OPEN AND MOVED TO ISSUE NUMBER NINE. WHICH IS WILDFIRE. LITIGATION THIS IS A- ONE MILLION SEVEN HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN THOUSAND PERYEAR FOR YOUR LIMITED TERM RESOURCE ON THE STATE HIGHWAY ACCOUNT REQUEST GO AHEAD YES GERMAN OTHER DEPARTMENTS TRANSPORTATION IS REQUESTING AN INCREASE OF ONE POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR FOUR YEAR LIMIT TERM RESOURCE FOR. INCREASES IN THE LEGAL DIVISIONS WORKLOAD RESULTING FROM WILD FIRE LITIGATION. THE WORKLOAD FOR SEEN REGARDING WILDLIFE LITIGATION EXCEEDS THE LEGAL DIVISIONS EXISTING STAFF. AND CANNOT BE ABSORBED BY CURRENT STAFFING LEVELS AND FUNDING. THERE ARE MULTIPLE WILDFIRE LITIGATIONS THAT MAY COINCIDE WITH EACH OTHER DURING THE DURING THE NEXT YEAR WHAT THE NUMBER OF PLANES RANGING FROM SIX HUNDRED TO OVER FIFTEEN HUNDRED. TIMELY AND SUCCESSFUL DEFENSE OF WILDFIRE LITIGATION WERE REQUIRED DEDICATED RESOURCES. SPECIFIC TO THE MEDIA THE METS THANK CHAIRMAN. AS SIMPSON THOUGHTS. YES IN REGARD TO THE WELFARE LITIGATION- WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE APPROVED A PROPOSAL TO AUGMENT FUNDING FOR CALTRANS LEGAL DIVISION- AND OUR ASSESSMENT WE FOUND THAT WORKLOAD IS LIKELY TO INCREASE THE MING FROM ABOUT FOR LITIGATION AND IT'S WITHIN THE STATE'S INTEREST A SUFFICIENTLY FUNDED APARTMENT TO DEFEND ANY LAWSUIT IN THIS REGARD- HOWEVER WHEN LOOKING INTO THE SITUATION FURTHER- WE DO RAISE SOME CONCERNS WITH THE LEVEL OF SERVICE SCORES THAT THE DEPARTMENT MONITORS IN REGARDS THE TREE AND BRUSH ENCROACHMENT WHICH ARE KIND OF A METRIC ON. HOW WELL CALTRANS IS DOING IN TERMSOF- MAINTAINING THE BRUSH ALONG THE STATE HIGHWAY SYSTEM THE SCORES IN RECENT YEARS HAVE BEEN AROUND SEVENTY- IN A RECENT REPORT THE DEPARTMENT INDICATED THAT THEY WOULD LIKE THE SCORE TO BE AROUND NINETY- WE HAVE NO INDICATION TO BELIEVE THAT THE THOSE SCORES ARE WHAT CAUSED THE FIRE BUT WE BELIEVE THAT IF THE LEGISLATURE'S INTERESTED IN FIGURING OUT WHAT THOSE CURRENT SCORES ARE AND HOW CALTRANS IS INTERESTED IN INCREASING THEM- WE HAVE A SERIES OF QUESTIONS AND OUR RECOMMENDATIONS AND CAN ALSO BE FOUND IN YOUR GENDER TO ASK THE DEPARTMENT. RIGHT NOW WE HAVE. WE HAVE THAT. I GUESS WHAT'S GO THROUGH THOSE- THE AYE YOU KNOW BECAUSE I THINK THIS IS THE LITIGATION SO I DON'T WANNA WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY THAT THAT YOU'RE HERE SO WE CAN HAVE A PUBLIC HEARING I GET THE REQUEST ON THE LITIGATION PART BUT THE QUESTION IS THAT HOW DO WE DO THE VEGETATION MANAGEMENT IN WE THIS SUBCOMMITTEE HAS IS DEALING WITH THE HOME WHOLE MOSAIC OF VEGETATION MANAGEMENT FOR YOU HAVE YOU KNOW STATE LANDS PRIVATELY OWNED LAND COMMERCIALLY TIMBERED LANDS- PLANS THAT ARE COMMERCIALLY CHAMBERED AND JUST HAVE TO BE HAVE TREES. YOU JUST HAVE OTHER VEGETATION CHAPARRAL THAT'S THERE WE KNOW THE CAL FIRE HAS DOES THE ASSESSMENT AND SAYS OKAY THIS IS WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO BUT A LOT OF THAT THEY BRING IN THE LUMBERJACKS IF THEY NEED TO DO TREAT THINNING AND- THEY BRING IN. FOLKS THAT DO THAT THE TWO THAT WORK- AND THEN THERE'S SOME. COMMERCIAL TIMBER FOLKS THAT ARE DOING THEIR REGULAR TIMBER HARVEST PLANS THAT MAY BE WITHIN THIS IS OWNED BY THE BY THE- AT THE CALTRANS IN A WITHIN YOUR- WHAT IS THE- WHAT IS THE VEGETATION. LEVEL I MEAN DIDN'T THE DISTANCE. NINETY FOUR EIGHT HUNDRED. IN ANY EVENT OUR. EXPLAIN TO ME HOW THE SYMPHONY COMES TOGETHER WITH THE CALTRANS AND CAL FIRE IN THESE PRIVATE- ENTITIES THAT ARE DOING BASICALLY THE SAME TYPE OF WORK WERE REDUCING VEGETATION MANAGEMENT. SO I THINK I CAN TRY TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION MISTER CHAIR- OKAY. OKAY SO JUST JUST OVERALL THE LEVEL OF SERVICE GORE'S WHAT WE USE THAT FOR WITH AND PRIVATE TRANSPORTATION IS WAIT FOR DIVISION MADE AS TO VALUE WAIT HOW WE'RE MAINTAINING. VARIOUS ACTIVITIES ON THE STATE HIGHWAY SYSTEM PART OF THAT INCLUDES VEGETATION CONTROL TREE AND SHRUB CLEAN UP CAT. SO THOSE LITTLE SERVICE SCORES RANGE FROM ZERO TO ONE HUNDRED AND WE IDENTIFY THOSE SCORES BASED ON WHETHER OR NOT IT PASSES THERE'S A NEED ORDERS A DIRE NEED NOR FOR CLEANUP SERVICES THAT CONTROLS THE PRIORITIZATION. ON WHAT WORKS CAN BE DONE. IT'S BASICALLY A SNAPSHOT IN TIME BETWEEN MARCH AND AUGUST A WHAT IS NEEDED. ADD WOULD BASICALLY WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS EVALUATE A SECOND PORTION OF THE HIGHWAY. ONE MILE SEGMENTS VERY DETAIL YOU KNOW I WOULD TRY TO CUT IT COVERS THAT 20% OF THE- AREA FOR EVERY REGIONAL EVERY THAT WE ARE WE MAINTAIN. WITH THAT SAID WE USE THOSE SCORES TO PRIORITIZE THE VEGETATION AND IS TO BE DONE NOW. THE LEVEL SCORES MAY BE DECLINING A LITTLE BIT FOR THE PAST COUPLE YEARS MAILINGS BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN RDIRECTING OUR RESOURCES FOR WILDFIRE EFFORTS WHICH IS THE PRIMARY CONCERN FOR OUR SAFETY PURPOSE FOR THE GENERAL PUBLIC AND TO TRY TO PREVENT WILDFIRES FROM OCCURRING. THE WHOLE LEVEL OF SERVICE SCORE HOWEVER IS CONTROLLED BY THE VEGETATION FROM THE STATEWIDE EFFORT OKAY AND SO. THERE COULD BE SOME AREAS WHERE THEY DON'T POSE AN IMMEDIATE THREAT TO THE MOTORING PUBLIC OR TO A SAFETY CONCERNS ON THE HIGHWAY SYSTEM. THE MORE COSMETIC IN NATURE. CONSEQUENTLY WE WANT TO DRESS THOSE BECAUSE THE PRIORITIES MORE TOWARDS THE SAFETY AEAS OF THAT DEPARTMENT SO THAT WE WORK TOGETHER WITH OTHER AREAS IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN THE VEGETATION. IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE THE SAFETY IS THERE ANYTHING WITH THESE COSMETIC AREAS WOULD THEY HAVE A LOWER SCORE OR WITH THE I MEAN BECAUSE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT ALLEY OF SUGGESTING SAID HOW DO YOU. WOULD YOU GOT TO DO TO GET SCORES UP RIGHT NOW DO YOU HOW DO YOU GET 290% THE WAY WE DO THAT IS BASED ON THE CUSTOMER SERVICE REQUEST THAT WE RECEIVE. THAT ADDRESS THE PRIORITIZATION OF THE EFFORT AND SO THE CAUSE MEDIC AREAS. IT COULD BE A LIE IN URBAN AREAS WHERE THE IMMEDIATE THREAT IS NOT THERE HOWEVER. ON PUBLIC PERCEPTION. THERE'S STILL A LOT OF CONCERN THAT THEY WANT THE VEGETATION CONTROLLED RIGHTLY SO HOWEVER BECAUSE OF THE PRIORITY AND THE AND THE LACK OF OR- THE LOW RISK AND SAFETY. BILL TRIED TO SCORE DOWN BECAUSE THAT WORK IS NOT AGAINST TO IT IMMEDIATELY AS WE MAY HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL THE NEXT YEAR ROUND THE TAKE A SNAPSHOT OF WHERE WE ARE WHICH AGAIN BRINGS LEVELS OF SERVICE DOWN. HIS PRESUMABLY YOU USING THE LIMITED FUNDS WE HAVE HERE TO DO THE HIGH PRIORITY SAID ARE IN FACT NOBODY'S CALLING ABOUT IT BUT IT'S A HIGH RISK GIVEN THE TERRAIN- ADJACENT TO YOUR RESPONSIBLE AREA IS THAT MORE OR LESS AT. CENTER STERN. ON THAT NOTE LET ME JUST. CALL OUT AND THANK YOU ALL OF FOR PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY WORK. pWHERE SAFETY. BOTH FROM A DRIVING PERSPECTIVE AND A WILDFIRE PERSPECTIVE KINDA COLLIDE. REGULAR RANG IMPRESSION YOU'VE OF NO BIKE LANE AND THAT. WE ALL KNOW THE NUMBER OF. DEATHS IS- SOBERING ON THAT STRETCH OF HIGHWAY SO. THERE'S A COMBINATION JUST FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE I KNOW THAT LIKE IT DOES COME SOMEWHAT COMMUNITY BASED SOMETIMES AND THINGS JUST POP UP AND THERE'S VIGILANT YOU KNOW RESIDENTS WHO SAY LOOK HERE BUT WHEN YOU GUYS ACTUALLY PICK UP THE PHONE. AND THEN GO FOLLOW THROUGH ON IT. THAT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT TRUST EXERCISE AND YOU GUYS BEEN MEETING THAT DOWN THERE AND I AND I KNOW THERE'S GOING TO THERE'S OTHER SPOTS LIKE THAT ALL OVER THE STATE WHERE. LITERALLY YOU HAVE. YOU KNOW THAT CIGARETTE BUT OR WHATEVER THAT THAT SORT OF. HIGHER RISK LEADS TO WILDFIRE BUT ALSO YOU KNOW YOU CAN SAVE LIVES IMMEDIATELY IN THE PROCESS SO- I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING A LITTLE MORE DETAIL- THE DAILY- TALKED ABOUT- GOING FORWARD BUT- BUT FROM MY ON THE GROUND EXPERIENCE- PICKING UP THE PHONE AND HAVING A REALLY. pCROWDSOURCING SOME OF THESE ISSUES I THINK WE OUGHT TO THINK ABOUT HOW TO INSTITUTIONALIZE THAT MORE I THINK RIGHT I'M A THERE'S THE PEOPLE SORT OF NOTE FIGURE OUT THE RIGHT THROUGH PUT IN THE NUMBER TO CALL THEY PICK UP THE PHONE BUT LIKE HOW DO HOW DO IS THE PUBLIC'S OR TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS BECAUSE THEY'LL THEY'LL BE ABLE TO SOMETIMES BEAT YOU TO THE PUNCH EVEN SO AND HAVE SOME TO THINK ABOUT BUT THANK. THANK YOU SIR THANK YOU FOR THAT CAUGHT THANK YOU FOR THE COMMENTS ARE STERN AND THANK IN AN APARTMENT FOR A- LOT OF SPOTS THAT QUICKLY. IT HELPED THE SCORES ARE IMPORTANT THE LEVEL SEVER SCORES ARE IMPORTANT- BUT IN. THIS AS YOU MENTIONED THE COSMETIC RELATED- FACTORS SOMETIMES DRIVE THOSE SCORES DOWN WE ARE RESPONSIBILITY IS TO FOCUS ON THE HIGH RISK AREAS THE HIGH PRIORITY YEARS. AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO- WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE SO LOCKED INTO YOU KNOW THE SCORES AND MAKE MAKING SURE WE- WE ABSOLUTELY NEED- YOU KNOW NINETY PERCENT. NINETY SCORE OR WHATEVER WE ARE. OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO MAKE SURE THAT. THE HIGH RISK AREAS ACROSS THE STATE THE STATE WE ARE WE ARE. A DEFINITELY- ADDRESSING DOES AND AS WE CAN GET TO THOSE. TO THE LOWER LEVEL SERVICE SCORES WE WILL ABSOLUTELY GET TO DOES. THAT MAKE SENSE AND MAYBE THE LITIGATION WILL GO AWAY HOPEFULLY. YES LET'S OPEN UP THE PUBLIC HEARING THIS IS ISSUE NUMBER NINE WILDLIFE LITIGATION. SEEING NO MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC CLOSE THE MATTER- THE DIRECTOR. MY GUESS IS.

TURN IT OVER TO OUR PARTNERS FROM DELAY. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS BEFORE USE THE MOTOR VEHICLE ACCOUNT IT'S PRIMARILY FUNDED BY A VEHICLE REGISTRATION BASE FEE IS SIXTY DOLLARS AND A C. H. P. FEE OF TWENTY SIX DOLLARS BOTH OF THOSE HAVE BEEN AND FLEX INDEXED TO INFLATION. AS YOU CAN SEE ON THE PHONE CONDITION. THE MOTOR VEHICLE ACCOUNT IS APPROACHING- INSOLVENCY BY THE YEAR TWENTY TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE SEVERAL COST PRESSURES HAVE BEEN PLACED ON THE ACCOUNT INCLUDING- THE REAL ID COSTS ANNUAL EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION COSTS ACROSS ALL DEPARTMENTS EXPAND FROM THE FUND- AND CAPITAL OUTLAY PROJECTS- GIVEN THAT. THE ADMINISTRATION IS GOING TO CONTINUE TO MONITOR THE FUND AS WE APPROACH THIS OUT YEARS- BUT IN THE IN THE SHORT TERM THE ADMINISTRATION IS PROPOSING SEVERAL- COST SAVING MEASURES INCLUDING- HAVING DMV CHARGE FOR ITS COLLECTION OF THE TRANSPORTATION IMPROVEMENT FEE THAT WAS ENACTED BY SB ONE- WILL WILL BE CHARGING THEIR COST OF SIX POINT SIX MILLION ANNUALLY TO THE ROAD MAINTENANCE AND REAL REHABILITATION ACCOUNT INSTEAD OF THE NBA. THAT GIVES US A LITTLE BIT OF SAVINGS WE'RE PROPOSING TO FUND CAPITAL OUTLAY PROJECTS- USING PUBLIC BUILDING CONSTRUCTION FUND AND WE'RE CONTINUING TO SUSPEND THE NON ARTICLE NINETEEN GENERAL FUND TRANSFER FOR THE NEXT FOUR YEARS. GET INTO A DISCUSSION OF THE SHE SHIFTING FROM THE PATIENT CO TO THE- FINANCING MECHANISM LA- YOU HAVE. SIGNIFICANT COMMENTS ON THIS- BUDGET PROPOSAL PLEASE PROCEED. I'M MISTER CHAIR- SO YES THE ADMINISTRATION HAS PROPOSED- SEVERAL PROPOSALS THAT DOES GIVE- SMALL AMOUNTS OF RELIEF TO THE COST PRESSURES THAT THE NBA FACE SAYS- BUT THERE IS THE STRUCTURAL IMBALANCE IN THE NBA WHERE THE EXPENDITURES ARE- OUTPACING THE ARE INCREASING AT A HIGHER RATE THAN THE REVENUES ARE- AND AS THE AT THE VERY FINANCES MENTIONED. AT THE FUND WILL BECOME INSOLVENT BY TWENTY TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE WITHOUT ANY FURTHER ACTION I'M- JUST MOVING FORWARD THE LEGISLATURE THESE TO BE MINDFUL OF ANY ONGOING COMMITMENTS FROM THE NBA INCLUDING AS YOU SAID SHIFTING- AT THE FUNDING OF COP OUTLAY PROJECTS AT. THROUGH BOND FINANCING OVER CASH FINANCING BECAUSE IN THE LONGER TERM- THAT WILL CREATE ADDITIONAL COST PRESSURES TO THE FIND I'M- THE LEGISLATURE ME I NEED TO CONSIDER EITHER. KIND OF THE LONGER FIX EITHER INCREASING REVENUES OR REDUCING OPERATIONAL COSTS BUT OF COURSE EACH- OPTION HAS ITS TRADE OFFS. YOU CLARIFY FOR ME I'M ONE OF THE- RECOMMENDATION SHE MAKE IS THE INCREASE THE MPA FEES IN THE INDICATE THAT WE COULD YOU ESTIMATE THAT WE CAN HAVE THIRTY FIVE MILLION. IN ADDITIONAL REVENUE FOR A ONE DOLLAR INCREASE ON THE BASE REGISTRATION VEHICLE REGISTRATION AS WELL AS FIVE MILLION IF A ONE DOLLAR INCREASE IN THE DRIVER'S LICENSE FEE NOW. CAN YOU CLARIFY FOR US MEAN WE SAY INCREASES TYPICALLY LEGISLATURE'S COULD THINK OF A TWO THIRDS. VOTE RIGHT TO TAKE IF WE INCREASES BUT IF IT'S JUST AN INCREASE TO THE ACTUAL COSTS THAT WE KNOW WHERE IT'S GOING TO OCCUR. IS THAT AN ADMINISTRATIVE ACTIVITY YOUR WORD IS THAT WHAT IS AT CHANGE BECAUSE IF YOU'RE YOU'RE SAYING STRUCTURALLY WE'RE GONNA BE TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. IN FISCAL. TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE. YES THE- MAYBE PRACTICE ONE POINT OF CLARIFICATION IS THAT- WE PUT BEFORE YOU SOME KIND OF THE RANGE OF OPTIONS THE LEGISLATURE WILL NEED TO- POSSIBLY CONSIDER IN THE FUTURE AS A NBA COMES AN IMBALANCE WOULDN'T NECESSARILY RECOMMEND- THAT. FEED THE FEE INCREASES BE THE OPTION THAT YOU CHOOSE BUT IT CERTAINLY WILL BE ONE OF THE OPTIONS THAT YOU HAVE IN FRONT OF YOU. OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS BUT MORE SPECIFICALLY TO YOUR QUESTION I THINK TO THE EXTENT THAT- FEE INCREASES TIED SPECIFICALLY TO CERTAIN ACTIVITIES. AND THE- AN INCREASE IN VIETNAM IS MEANT TO ADDRESS THE INCREASE IN STATE COSTS FOR SERVICE PROVIDED THAT GENERALLY IN THE STATE CONSTITUTION WOULD BE SOMETHING- THAT COULD BE DONE WITH MAJORITY VOTE- HOWEVER IF YOU DON'T HAVE THAT- THAT SORT OF NEXUS THEN. GENERALLY WILL BE CONSIDER ATTACKS REQUIRE TWO THIRDS OF IT UNDER THE STATE CONSTITUTION FINANCE WOULD YOU HAVE TO SAY ABOUT THE NEXUS BETWEEN THESE. BRAIN THIS IS MY WIFE FOURTH HERE HERE. AND EVERY YEAR WERE TALK ABOUT THE MV A STRUCTURAL DEFICIT IT SAID. SOMETHING I LOOK FORWARD TO EVERY MARCH CONTINUING INTO APRIL- CAN YOU GUYS STRONG NEXUS. A DENIM MA'AM NOT DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- I WOULD SAY THAT THE NEXUS IS QUITE CLEAR BETWEEN WITH THE ACTIVITIES- WHAT- REVENUE INCREASED AND WHAT THE ACTIVITY SUPPORT. IT IS- OUR UNDERSTANDING THOUGH THAT A INCREASE IN THAT THE CITY WOULD REQUIRE- A TWO THIRDS VOTE EITHER THE C. H. P. V. OR THE- THE VEHICLE REGISTRATION FEE THAT. MATTHEW READ MENTIONED BEFORE EVEN IF WE CAN SHOW OR YOU COULD SHOW OR DAILY IT COULD SHOW THAT IT WAS. STRICTLY TIED TO THE ACTUAL SERVICES THAT WERE BEING. DELIVERED TO THE- MOTORING PUBLIC. WE BELIEVE SO BUT AND A LOT OF MOMENTUM NOT A SIMPLE MAJORITY VOTE. WE WOULD CERTAINLY- BE INTERESTED IN EXPLORING WHETHER OR NOT IT COULD BE- MAJORITY VOTE AS OPPOSED TO A TWO THIRDS VOTE SO- YOU KNOW. IF IT'S OKAY WITH YOU MISTER WE'D LIKE TO TAKE A LOOK AT THAT AND GET BACK TO YOU YOUR STAFF YEAH. DE MORGAN HOLD THE MATTER ANYWAY SO- THAT WOULD BE WEIRD. CHANGING TIMES NOW AT THAT WERE IN AND WE KNOW THIS IS THIS IS THE DEMANDS ARE. PROBABLY EVEN MORE GIVEN THE COMPETING POLICY THAT WE HAVE WITH A LECTURE VEHICLES AND THAT THE REDUCTION IN THE INCREASE IN. VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED AND THIS JUST LESS MONEY COMING IN FROM THE GASOLINE MOTORING PUBLIC. YOU CAN. LET'S OPEN UP THE PUBLIC HEARING THIS IS ISSUE NUMBER. THIS IS A PHYSICIAN NUMBER.

THE PUBLIC HEARING THIS IS NOT SORRY- I'M SORRY I LIED WE DO NOT HAVE ANY- CONCERNS ANY PARTICULAR CAP OUT LATE PROPOSAL- HOWEVER WE AGREE WITH COMMITTEE STAFF THAT SHIFTING FROM CASH FOR FUNDING TO BOND FINANCING IS OF CONCERN FOR THE LONGER TERM- AT BECAUSE IT CREATES ADDITIONAL COST PRESSURES TO THEM BE. WE AGREE ARE LET'S OPEN UP THE PUBLIC HEARING THIS IS ISSUE NUMBER TWELVE CAPITAL OUTLAYS FOR THE- I WILL CONTROL. THIS CLOSE PUBLIC HEARING WILL KEEP THIS MATTER OPEN AND NOW E. CIGARETTES AND A IT WOULD APPEAR SITS HERE IS A NEW ENDEAVOR BY THE C. H. P. TO BE DOING- AND- INVESTIGATIVE WORK ON ON THE CIGARETTES BUT PLEASE GO AHEAD WITH YOUR SOCIAL AND THE CIGARETTE AND ENFORCEMENT. WE HAVE A VCP BEFORE YOU THAT REQUEST TEN POSITIONS AND SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS IN PERMANENT AUGMENTATION FROM THE ELECTRONIC CIGARETTE PRODUCTS TAX FUNDING FISCAL YEAR TWENTY TWENTY ONE TO STAND UP A TASK FORCE CHARGED WITH COMBATING ILLICIT VAPING DEVICE AND PRODUCT IMPORT EXPORT MANUFACTURING TRANSPORTATION DISTRIBUTION AND SALES. OR THE PAST FEW YEARS THE USE OF ELECTRONIC CIGARETTES COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS VAPING HAS INCREASED GREATLY. THIS NEW POPULARITY HAS LED TO A MARKET FOR ILLICIT VAPING DEVICES AND OTHER COMMODITIES. UNREGULATED THESE BLACK MARKET PRODUCTS CAN CONTAIN DANGEROUS ADDED ADDITIVES FOUND IN BOTH VAPING LIQUIDS AND IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE DEVICES THEMSELVES. AS OF DECEMBER TWENTY NINETEEN THE CDC PLACES A NUMBER OF THE CIGARETTE VAPING. SELECT AT USE ASSOCIATED WITH LONG INJURIES AT TWO THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED NINETY ONE AND THE NUMBER OF DEATHS NATIONALLY AND FORTY EIGHT. TO ADDRESS IS RAPIDLY INCREASING- USE USE BY USE OF THIS POTENT NICOTINE BASED PRODUCTS THE PROPOSED BUDGET SEEKS A NEW NICOTINE CONTENT BASE THE CIGARETTE TAX. THE NEW TAX WILL BEGIN ON JANUARY OF ONE TWENTY TWENTY ONE. IT WILL ADD TWO DOLLARS FOR EACH FORTY MILLIGRAMS OF NICOTINE IN THE PRODUCT. THE TAXI WILL BE USED FOR ADMINISTRATION ENFORCEMENT YOU PREVENTION AND HEALTH CARE WORKFORCE PROGRAM. OUR PROPOSAL LEVERAGES THE OVER SEVEN THOUSAND UNIFORMED OFFICERS THIRTY FOUR STATIONERY COMMERCIAL VEHICLE INSPECTIONS AND ARE NEARLY FOUR MILLION CONTACTS IN THE SIEGE BE SPECIALIZED INVESTIGATIONS TEAM DELETED TASK FORCE IN COOPERATION WITH THE DOJ TO PROVIDE FOCUSED ENFORCEMENT. WITH THE INTENT TO INVESTIGATE AND DISRUPT THE FLOW OF ILLICIT VAPING DEVICES AND PRODUCTS BEING DISTRIBUTED THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AS AN INITIAL FOUNDATION FOR THE PROGRAM WE'RE ASKING FOR ONE SERGEANT TO SUPERVISE A STATEWIDE PROGRAM AND NINE OFFICERS BEFORE SPECIALIZED CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS AND ENFORCEMENT. TARGETING ILLICIT VAPING DEVICES- PRODUCT IMPORT EXPORT MANUFACTURING TRANSPORTATION. DISTRIBUTION AND SALES WE PROPOSE THREE POINT FIVE MILLION OF THE SEVEN MILLION BE ALLOCATED FOR CONTRACTING WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE TO DATE AS WITH THESE EFFORTS. WE HAVE RECEIVED A LETTER COMMITMENT FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE ENDORSING THIS EFFORT AND SUPPORTING PCP. THE CEASE BEING A DOJ HAVE A HISTORY OF WORKING TOGETHER WITH SPECIALIZED TASK FORCES FOR FORSMAN EFFORTS. THIS PROPOSAL COMBINES THE UNIQUE STRENGTH OF BOTH OUR DEPARTMENT. AND LEVERAGES ARTS EXPERTISE AND RESOURCES TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE. WHICH HAS BEEN LABELED AN EPIDEMIC BY SOME. I GUESS COMMISSIONER STANLEY THE QUESTION ISWHY THE CHP IN THIS AREA THAT YOU'VE NEVER DONE AND WHY WOULD YOU NOT DEVELOP A GRANT PROGRAM THAT YOU WOULD USE EXISTING LOCAL POLICE. THAT THEY DID THEY HAD REMEMBER WHEN THEY WE HAD A GRANT PROGRAM WHERE THEY WOULD HAVE SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD SAID LOOK LIKE THIRTY YEAR OLDS WALK IN AND TRY TO BUY CIGARETTES WHEN I WAS EIGHTEEN AND THAT WAS- YOU KNOW YOU HAD. TONS THE CITIES AND COUNTIES THAT WANTED TO PARTICIPATE IN DEBT AND GET SOME MONEY SO THAT THEY COULD HAVE THE TECH GIVES OR WHOEVER WHOEVER'S THE PEOPLE THAT DO THAT. THAT TYPE OF WORK ONE WELL I'LL TALK ABOUT WHEN HE SEES P. IN IN IN THAT SECOND I HAVE- ASSISTANT CHIEF. HONDA RATE TALK ABOUT. WHAT THE LOCALS ARE DOING WHY THE SIEGE BE STATEWIDE ORGANIZATION WHICH WERE IN ALL FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES- HERE IN CALIFORNIA. WE HAVE PERSONNEL THAT WORK IN VARIOUS TASK FORCES SEE TIP- COMMERCIAL- IN FORCING A TASK FORCE INTERFERE FOREIGN EXPORT IN RECOVERY. AND THEY'RE OUT THERE IN THE FIELD EVERY DAY COMING ACROSS- PRODUCTS- THAT HAVE BEEN STOLEN OR THAT ARE ILLEGAL. AND WE ARE ABLE TO INTERCEPT THESE COMMODITIES ARREST THOSE PEOPLE. WHO ARE COMMITTING. THESE CRIMES. RECENTLY WE STARTED THE ORGANIZED RETAIL RETAIL PASSED TASK FORCES. THERE ARE THREE IN THE STATE ONE IN SAN FRANCISCO ONE IN LA. AND ONE IN SAN DIEGO TO COMBAT THE RETAIL THAT THAT IS GOING ON IN THOSE TASK FORCES. HAVE BEEN EXTREMELY SUCCESSFUL AND WE'VE- ALSO WORKING WITH LOCAL DJS AND LOCAL PT'S INSURERS. ARE ON THOSE TASK FORCES TO- TO COMBAT THOSE CRIMES AND WE FEEL- TAKING THAT APPROACH WE WOULD BE ABLE TO. HAVE AN IMPACT BEING THAT WE'RE STATEWIDE ORGANIZATION. BECAUSE THESE ARE- LEGAL DEVICES IN HIS CRIMINAL ACTIVITY WHICH IS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT. AND PLAN ASSISTANT CHIEF DRAPER TALK ABOUT WHAT THE LOCALS ARE DOING WITH SOME OF THAT GRANT MONEY YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT IT BUT THAT THE- LA- SUGGESTED WE LEARN A LITTLE ABOUT. THE GEOGRAPHIC CONCENTRATION IT OR THAT THE SCOPE OF THE PROBLEM AND THAT SOME OF THIS MAY BE LIMITED RATHER IN ALL FIFTY STATES MAY BE LIMITED IN TO CERTAIN TARGET AREAS. THAT THE MONEY COULD BE USED RATHER THAN HAVE EVERY C. H. P. OFFICER THROUGHOUT THE STATE. OR NOT EVERY TEN PICK TEN POSITIONS DOING IT- THAT YOU WOULD HAVE THIS IS MORE FOLK. A ON WHEN WE WERE WE THINK THIS ILLICIT MARKET IS THAT PLEASE. GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRED NUMBER THREE CHIEF THAT'S A PROMOTION ASSISTANT CHIEF BUT APPRECIATE IT UP TO YOU TO HEAR THE- THIS. IS A GOOD MORNING MY NAME CHANDERI ON THE ASSISTANT CHIEF FOR THE CHP IN THE DEPARTMENTS LEGISLATIVE LIAISON- THE QUESTION AS TO WHY IN SOME OF THE QUESTIONS YOU'RE BRINGING UP A TO BE HONEST I WAS OUR FIRST QUESTION TWO MORE APPROACH WITH THIS PROPOSAL BUT AS WE LOOKED AT IT. AND THE ANSWER IS PRETTY CLEAR TO US IF ONE WE WANT TO RECOGNIZE THE EFFORTS OF DEPARTMENT HEALTH DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND THE LOCALS AND WHAT THEY'RE DOING. BUT WHAT THEY ARE DOING IS ADDRESSING THE ILLICIT OR BLACK MARKET EFFORTS THAT ARE OUT THERE LAST YEAR IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN AND TWENTY PROPERTY SIX AFFORD OVER THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS THAT WAS AWARDED TO GRANTS OVER SEVENTY SIX DIFFERENT AGENCIES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. THEIR EFFORTS ALTHOUGH WHILE- IMPORTANT ARE FOCUSED ON REGULATORY ENFORCEMENT- WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT BY BUS WITH MINORS WHICH ARE OTHERWISE LEGAL- PRODUCTS THAT THEY'RE BUYING WE'RE TALKING ABOUT BRIDGING THE GAP THAT FROM WHAT WE KNOW IS NOT BEING ADDRESSED IN THAT GAP WOULD BE WITH THE ILLICIT. THE LEGAL THE BLACK MARKET THE CRIMINAL ACTIVITY THAT'S GOING ON OUT THERE. AND EXPERTS BELIEVE THAT THAT'S WHERE THE INJURIES THAT'S FOR THE DESKS AND THAT'S WHERE THE- THE PROBLEM LIES AS THE TAXES AND LEGAL COMMODITIES ARE TAXED WE BELIEVE THAT THE BLACK MARKET MORE PEOPLE CAN BE DRIVEN TOWARDS THAT SO THE PROBLEM ON THE BLACK MARKET THE LIST OF PRODUCTS ARE GONNA. RISE THAT'S WHERE THE SIEGE BE DOES HAVE EXPERT THAT'S YOU KNOW LEVERAGING THE- THE SEVEN THOUSAND MEMBERS OF THE HIGHWAY PATROL AND I KNOW WE DON'T WANT ALL GOING TO BE AN EXPERT BUT WE DO ON ALL OF THEM TO BE FOCUSED ON THIS WE DO WANT ALL OF THEM WHEN THEY'RE IN A TRAFFIC STOP TO RECOGNIZE OKAY THIS COULD BE. ILLEGAL PRODUCT LAST YEAR WE RECOVERED OVER FIFTY SEVEN THOUSAND POUNDS OF ILLICIT DRUGS- I DON'T KNOW FOR SURE BUT I WOULD BE WILLING TO BET THAT THE LARGEST SEIZURE BY ANYONE AGENCIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE. AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE WOULD TAKE OUR EXPERTISE WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT GOING INTO KEEPING A SIXTEEN YEAR OLD FROM BUYING A PRODUCT THAT THOSE EFFORTS WITH THE LEGAL TO DO MORE TALK ABOUT BRIDGING THAT GAP. AND PERHAPS INTERCEPTING SHIPMENTS TRUCKLOADS COMING INTO OUR PORTS AND SEIZING HE WE GO PRODUCT BEFORE GETS DISTRIBUTED TO THE STATE. WELL YOU HAVE SOME THOUGHTS ON THIS MATTER. SORRY THANK YEAR ANSWERS HERE SO WE DEFINITELY BELIEVE THAT TAKING ACTION ON AND- ILLICIT VAPING PRODUCTS IS LAUDABLE AND GIVEN THE SERIOUS HEALTH CONCERNS VERY IMPORTANT. HOWEVER AS YOU MENTIONED WE DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS WITH THE PROPOSAL AND IN PARTICULAR AS- AS DEPARTMENT MENTIONED THE PROBLEM IS VERY- AND THERE'S A LOT OF UNKNOWNS WITH THE PROBLEMS SO- AS YOU MENTIONED THERE. IS THAT AND CERTAINTY AROUND THAT YOU EAT JAGA FEE OF THE PROBLEM WHETHER IT IS REALLY A STATE WIDE OR CONCENTRATION ISSUE THERE IS ALSO. AT N UNCERTAINTY AROUND KIND OF. ALL THE ALL THE ISSUES THAT ARE INTER CONNECTED WITH THE VAPING HEALTH PROBLEMS SO IS IT REALLY A YOU KNOW A USE NICOTINE AND ISSUE WHERE. THAT THAT YOU KNOW THAT IS PART OF THE PROBLEM BUT ALSO IN ADDITION TO THAT. THE ADDITIVES THAT ARE IN THE ILLICIT CANNABIS PRODUCTS I'M- AND ONCE WE HAVEN'T KIND OF HAVE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE PROBLEM AND THE LEGISLATURE MAY BE ABLE TO. DECIDE ON AN APPROPRIATE TIME STRATEGY THAT MAY MOST EFFECTIVELY ADDRESS THE PROBLEM SO IF IT REALLY IS A STATE WIDE ENFORCEMENT STRATEGY THAT YOU MAY WANT TO PURSUE THAN A SPEECH HE MAY BE THE MOST APPROPRIATE- GIVEN THEIR CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIVE BACKGROUND- BUT THERE'S ALSO OTHER DEPARTMENTS THAT DO HAVE- KIND OF MORE CONTENT EXPERTISE FOR EXAMPLE- PURE OF CANDACE CONTROL HAS KIND OF THE REGULATORY UNDERSTANDING OF- ILLICIT CANNABIS PRODUCTS AND- THAT MAY BE. AB YOU KNOW CONTACTS WITH THESE THAT YOU MAY ALSO WANT TO LEVERAGE IN THE TASK FORCE IF STATEWIDE ENFORCEMENT IS AS- IS AND WHAT YOU BELIEVE IS THE MOST EFFECTIVE STRATEGY. AND THEN AND SO. I THINK ONCE THERE IS A BIT MORE- UNDERSTANDING OF THE UNKNOWNS REGARDING THE ISSUE AND ITS CONNECTION TO THE HEALTH EPIDEMIC THEN. THE LEGISLATURE CAN MOST DAM. CREATE THE MOST EFFECTIVE STRATEGY TO ADDRESS THE SERIOUS HEALTH CONCERN. THANK YOU ACT CAN CAN YOU CLARIFY MEMBER JUST COMMENT ON THAT THE COORDINATION QUESTION WITH YOUR CAMPUS CONTROLLING JUST HOW YOU ALL ENVISIONED THAT SHAKING OUT. AND LIKE. CAN DISSIPATE AT THIS POINT FROM WHAT YOU KNOW THE LOT OF THE ACTIVITY. IS A VERY GOOD IT'S SORT OF GOING AFTER SHIP MEN TRAFFICKING ISSUES IS THIS IS THIS STUFF THAT'S ON THE ROAD AND THAT'S THE INTERVENTION POINT ARE YOU LOOKING AT SPECIFIC THEY CAN EVEN GOING AT THE RETAIL SIDE OF IT AND TRY TO COORDINATE THAT WITH YOUR A CANNABIS CONTROL CAN USE LIKE JUST. FLUSH OUT HOW HOW YOU COULD SEE THE NEXT YEAR TRANSPIRE WITHOUT OBVIOUSLY TIPPING YOUR HAND AND- DISCLOSING WHATEVER YOUR STRATEGY IS GOING TO BE- BIG PART OF THE STRATEGY IS WAS WORKING WITH DOJ AS WE HAVE WORK WITH THEM AND OTHER TASK FORCES THROUGHOUT THE STATE ONE WE HAVE RIGHT NOW IS OUR- SPECIAL OPERATIONS UNIT AND- WITH. THE TECHNOLOGY THAT WE HAVE WITH THE **** THAT WE HAVE WITH OUR INVESTIGATIVE SKILLS WORKING TOGETHER- WITH DOJ WE FEEL WE BE ABLE TO- YEAH WE CAN INTERCEPT THEM ON THE ROAD. IN A RETAIL ESTABLISHMENTS AND WORK THOSE CRIMINAL CASES NOW ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE LEARNED THROUGH SOME OF THE RESEARCH THAT WE HAVE DONE ALL THE TIME WE IN A LITTLE BIT MORE. IS THAT YOU KNOW. A GOOD PORTION IS CARS ON THE INTERNET. AND WE HAVE WHAT WE CALL OUR COMPUTER CRIMES INVESTIGATIONS UNIT WHICH IS- MADE ABOUT THE LIEUTENANT- SERGEANT IN EIGHT OFFICERS AND SOME. CIVILIAN I. T. PERSONNEL AND THIS IS WHAT THEY DO IS THEY HLP US OUT WITH COMPUTER CRIMES- CASES THEY HELP IS TO- INTERNET SEARCHES OR- ESPECIALLY WITH THAT YOU KNOW PETA FILES AND- AND THOSE KIND OF THINGS EIGHT THEY CAN DO A LOT OF WORK FOR US THAT WOULD. HELP US IN THAT IN THAT ARENA SOME OF THIS IS GOING ON. I WOULD ADD WHAT WE AGREE WITH THE LA- IN THE FACT THAT WE REALLY DON'T KNOW BECAUSE NOBODY'S REALLY. WORKING IN THIS AREA OF ILLICIT BLACK MARKET ENFORCEMENT SO WE REALLY DON'T KNOW THE PROBLEM OF THE PROBLEM AND- TO YOUR QUESTION SENATOR. WE DO HAVE A GOOD WORKING RELATIONSHIP WITH THE CAMPUS CONTROL NOW WHEN IT COMES TO. CANNABIS AND THE ENFORCEMENT OF THAT SO WE WOULD ABSOLUTELY LEVERAGE THOSE RELATIONSHIPS AND THEIR- EXPERTISE. AND THEN- TO THE QUESTION IS IT BEING OPERATED ON THE HIGHWAYS IN TRANSPORT ABSOLUTELY EVERY SHIPMENT THE YOU KNOW IT'S COMING IN THE UNITED STATES MOST IMPROBABLY THROUGH. OUR PORTS- IN CALIFORNIA AND THEN GETTING SHIPPED IN AND THAT'S PROBABLY WHY THE FIFTY THREE THOUSAND POUNDS- I SAID YOU KNOW. MENTIONED EARLIER IT'S BECAUSE WE ARE OUT THERE ON THE HIGHWAYS AND WE ARE MAKING FOUR MILLION PUBLIC CONTACTS YEARS SO. IT IN SO. MANY IN TERMS OF I KNOW WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO. ON ON ON THE BCC SIDE TRYING TO. M. DEAL WITH SOME OF THE TESTING BOTTLENECKS AND IN TERMS OF SOURCING SPECIALLY ON IN THAT CANNABIS VAPING MARKET RIGHT IDENTIFYING. THE ORIGIN. IS BECOMING SOMEWHAT EASIER IN STATE ALTHOUGH THERE'S STILL GROWS THAT HAPPENED ILLEGALLY ALL OVER THE PLACE THERE'S A LOT OF. OTHER INTERVENTION EFFORTS THERE BUT ARE YOU YOU ARE USE SORT OF SUGGESTING THAT SOME OF THE SOME OF THE REALLY TOUGH TO GET THAT PRODUCT THE REALLY DANGEROUS STUFF THAT'S RESULTING IN THESE THESE HEALTH CRISES. MAYBE COME IN FROM OUTSIDE OF OUR BORDERS IN OTHER WORDS. YET IT WOULD BE PREMATURE COMMENT ON THE SPECIFICS OF IT WE DO KNOW IN OUR PRELIMINARY RESEARCH THAT A LOT OF- AND I'VE QUICKLY BECOME MORE KNOWLEDGE ONE DAY CAN I NOTICE HER BEFORE- THIS BUT- YOU KNOW THEY'RE SHIPPING THESE CONTAINERS THAT YOU ACTUALLY THE VIALS OR WHATEVER THAT AND THEN THEY'RE BEING FILLED HERE. AND CALIFORNIA BY DIFFERENT PEOPLE AND SO YOU KNOW IF WE COULD INTERCEPT THOSE ILLEGAL SHIPMENTS A CONTAINERS THINK ABOUT MONEY- VAPING. ILLEGAL ONES WE COULD TAKE UP THE STREETS AND THOSE ARE WORTHY EASILY OR THE- DANGEROUS CHEMICALS AND STUFF FOR BEING INTRODUCED BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT REGULATED. I SEE SO THE ACTUAL IGNITION DEVICES AND THE CARTRIDGES IN THIS SORT OF THOSE PRODUCTS. ARE SIGNIFICANT RISK IN ADDITION TO THE ACTUAL. SAID A- PESTICIDE TREATED- TOBACCO OR OR- CANNABIS ITSELF THAT UPON COMBUSTION BECOMES. YEAH ABSOLUTELY. AND I THINK OUR FOCUS WOULD BE INSTEAD OF GOING TO THE END OF THE ROW AND GETTING THE END USER THAT'S BUYING IT ILLEGALLY TO GOING TO THE SUPPLY CHAIN TO DISRUPTING THE CRIMINAL IN PRICE IT'S BEHIND IT TO GOING TO THE LEGAL SURPRISE OUR- SUPPLIERS. ONLINE USE IN OUR- OUR COMPUTER CRIMES UNITS TO IDENTIFY THESE FOLKS AND- THANKS. APPOINTMENTS FINANCE THE AS- ELLIE- SUGGESTS IS THAT QUESTIONS WEATHERED CHP IS THE APPROPRIATE AGENCY TO LEAD THIS ANTENNA LISTED VAPING NO EFFORT. GOVERNOR'S CHOSEN THEM CAN YOU GIVE US YOUR THINKING OR GOVERNOR'S THINKING ON THIS OF. THE MATTER STANDING IN THE GOVERNOR'S THINKING ASSOCIATES P. LET WILL BE ABLE TO LEVERAGE I BELIEVE. THAT NIGHT DEPUTY CHIEF ASSISTANT CHIEF TERRY MENTIONED THE NUMBER OF COULD STATE WHAT CONTACTS THAT THEY HAVE TO THE GENERAL IDEA IS THAT IF YOU WERE TO PROVIDE. GRANTS TO LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT- THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO RIDE THE LIMITED AMOUNT OF FORCE IN OVER LIMITED AMOUNT OF TIME- FOR THE AMOUNT THE AVAILABLE BY THE GRANTS IF YOU'RE ABLE TO- LEVERAGE THE- NINE DIFFERENT OCCASIONS THROUGHOUT THE STATE FOR TEN EIGHT FILLED HIS EIGHT FEEL DIVISIONS EXCUSE ME IN. THEN I THINK HERE IN HEADQUARTERS- BUT A DIFFERENT DIVISIONS SO YOU HAVE ONE OFFICER IN EACH OF THOSE DIVISIONS OF THE INITIAL PLAN THE IDEA WOULD BE TO LEVERAGE THOSE CONTACTS- THAT THE OFFICERS MAKE IN THE FIELD. IF AN OFFICER IDENTIFIES SOMETHING FISHY- YOU MAYBE YOU- THAT OFFICER WOULD LIKELY BE TO CONTACT THE- LEAD OFFICER IN THAT DIVISIONS THAT WE WOULD HAVE A STATEWIDE PRESENCE TRYING TO UNDERSTAND EXACTLY WHAT'S HAPPENING. I TO THE ALEJO'S POINT THERE'S A LOT THAT'S NOT KNOWN ABOUT THIS AND SO THE IDEA WOULD BE TO BEGIN TO GET A BASE OF UNDERSTANDING AT THAT POINT MAKE BETTER INFORMED DECISIONS ABOUT WHAT THE BEST A FORCE BEEN STRATEGY WOULD BE. I THINK THEY'RE MAKING THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE HIGHER PATROL HAVING A PIECE OF THE SOLVING THE ILLICIT PROBLEM AND BEING THE LEADER OF SOLVING THE LIST OF PROBLEMS THAT THERE'S A DISTINCTION OTHER STATE AGENCIES THAT HAVE BEEN SUGGESTED. LET'S OPEN UP THE PUBLIC HEARING THIS IS ITEM NUMBER THIRTEEN THE E. CIGARETTE TAX ENFORCEMENT. PLEASE GOOD MORNING KELLY BEAM OF THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION REPRESENTING OVER FIFTY THOUSAND POSITIONS IN THE STATE AND I DON'T OFTEN FIND MYSELF IN THE RESOURCES UP SO THANK YOU- BUT WE ARE VERY MUCH. IN SUPPORT OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED EASE CIGARETTE TAX AND ALSO THIS ENFORCEMENT COMPONENT. IT'S UNFORTUNATE THE NATIONAL OUTBREAK IN THE FALL- SHED LIGHT ON HOW VAPING WHETHER CANNABIS OR TOBACCOIS IMPACTING THE PUBLIC HEALTH OVERALL. WE ARE STILL LEARNING ABOUT THIS NEW NIMBLE TECHNOLOGY AND INDUSTRY. AND I JUST WANT TO UNDERSCORE TO IT'S NOT JUST CHILDREN BUT ADULTS ARE AFFECTED AS WELL DURING THAT OUTBREAK THERE A LOT OF ADULTS WHO ARE KEEPING PRODUCTS THAT THEY GOT ONLINE AND- LIKE THE TESTIMONY EARLIER. THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT YOU KNOW THERE WAS THIS BIG UPRISING OF ALL THE CASES BUT WHEN AND WHEN THEY DRILL DOWN TO FIGURE OUT WHAT PRODUCTS THEY RE USING A- WAS A LOT. OF WHERE. THE JEWS HAD BEEN DISTILLED AND THE CANNABIS OR TOBACCO ADDED- WITH OTHER CHEMICALS THAT ARE NOT USED HERE IN THE STATES. IMPLEMENTING A TAX ON E. CIGARETTES AND THEIR LIQUIDS WITH STAMPS SO SIMILAR TO COMBUSTIBLE CIGARETTES ARE DONE NOW MAY DRIVE MORE THE MARKET UNDERGROUND AS WAS NOTED EARLIER WHETHER MATERIALS INCLUDED IN LIKE WITH ARE NOT REGULATED AT ALL. AND THEY THE IMPORT USING DRUMS OF LIQUID AND THEN THAT GOES DIFFERENT SHOPS AND THEY YOU CAN USE IT YOU CAN BUY A BOTTLE- AND THE SHOP CAN PUT IN WHATEVER THEY WANT TO BE HONEST WITH YOU- AND THEN THE CONSUMER BUYS THAT AND THEY CAN INSERTED INTO AN OPEN SYSTEM SO. AS OPPOSED TO A JEWEL- CARTRIDGE WITH A POD- THE INDUSTRY HAS CHANGED A LOT WITH THE FLAVOR BàN AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL SO NOW KIDS ARE PIVOTING TO DISPOSABLE. E. CIGARETTES WHERE THEY CAN GET WHATEVER FLAVOR THEY WANT BECAUSE THERE WAS A CAR ABOUT FOR DISPOSABLES. AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE INDUSTRY IS HELD ACCOUNTABLE AND THIS IS A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. TO HELP MITIGATE THE I KNOW. SORRY YES TO MITIGATE THE POTENTIAL EXPANSION OF THE UNDERGROUND MARKET BEFORE IT HAPPENS. THIS PROPOSAL FOR STATEWIDE EFFORT TARGETING THE ILLICIT MARKET BY THE CHP COUPLED WITH LOCAL ENFORCEMENT HURTING YOU'VE CONSUMPTION AND POSSESSION. AND THE SHOPS THE LOCAL SHOPS. PUBLIC HEALTH CAMPAIGNS AND A POTENTIAL BAN FLAVOR TOBACCO PRODUCTS WILL ALL WORK TOGETHER INFORMATION ABOUT THE INDUSTRY AND AFFECT CONSUMER BEHAVIOR POSITIVELY. IN THE LONG RUN THANK YOU.

HOW DOES IT SHAKE OUT THE ONES. ON THE LIST HERE THEN I REALIZED THAT MY STRANGE JUST MY CELL BUT AT RANDI KAYE A PART IN A FINANCE THERE IS AN IN PRY. HOWEVER AND NOT A SWING SPACE FOR. SENSE WITH. SECURING THE SWINGS ON IT IS FINISHED WITH DESIGN WAY FOR SWINGS. IN ORDER TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE THE FUNCTION. AND BUT WRECK. THAT THAT WOULD A YEAR. THERE'S THE CONSTRUCTION FOR IS BEING. BUT IT I MEAN JUST. FOR BROADER STRATEGIC THINKING HOW THE CONSUMER IN IS GONNA WORK FORWARD AND ALL. BIG TICKET THINKING I MEAN HOW DOES THIS SORT OF. CAPITAL PRICE FIT IN THAT DO YOU DO.

WE'VE ALSO ENGAGE THE GOV OPSAHL DEPUTY SECRETARY OVER TGS IN THAT CONVERSATION- AND SO. WHAT ENDINGS WERE TALKING ABOUT WE'VE JUST HAD RECENT CONVERSATIONS AGAIN WITHTHE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AS WE THINK ABOUT MODERNIZING THE DMV AND WE ARE DRIVING PEOPLE TO MORE DIGITAL TRANSACTIONS. WHAT IS THE DEMAND ON OUR FIELD OFFICE- I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT FOR US TO GET THROUGH WHAT I CALL THE INITIAL STAGES OF REAL ID AND THE DEMAND IS OBVIOUSLY VERY HIGH WITHOUT- SO AS WE THINK ABOUT BOTH OUR LEASE SPACE AND OUR OWN SPACE WHAT IS THAT FOR PRINT ME TO LOOK LIKE. IS THERE OPPORTUNITIES FOR US TO ACTUALLY PARTNER WITH OTHER DEPARTMENTS AND HOW WE USE OUR SPACE THESE ARE ALL THINGS WITH LOVE TO LOOK AT- YOU KNOW WE ALL HAVE KIND OF OUR VISION OF THE DMV OFFICE OF THE FUTURE PROBABLY LOOKING LIKE SOMETHING YOU SEE IN COMMERCIALS AROUND WHAT MODERN BANKS LOOK LIKE- THAT WOULD BE REALLY FUN AND EXCITING- AND I'M LOOKING FORWARD WE'RE GONNA GET A PRESENTATION FROM THE VENDOR THAT WE BROUGHT IN TO DO THE STUDY FOREST'S WE'LL BE GETTING THAT PRESENTATION SOON.

I CAN WHAT I LOVE OUR FIVE YEAR INSTEAD IN FIRST PLAN IS IT'S A MESS TO PRO. SO WE TAKE IT IN STEPS IN PHASES SO I WOULD SAY YES IT ALLOWS US TO CONTEMPLATE THINGS AND IF WE HAVE TO COURSE CORRECT IT ALLOWS US TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT COURSE CORRECTION BEFORE WERE LIKE. KNEE DEEP INTO DOING CONSTRUCTION WORK AND SO THAT IS YOU KNOW WITH A FIVE YEAR INFRASTRUCTURE PLAN WITH KIND OF A ONE YEAR LOOK WE'RE ABLE TO DO THOSE THOUGHTFUL WHAT I CALL BUSINESS PLANNING ACTIVITIES THANK YOU FOR THAT INSIGHT. HELP BOB LET'S OPEN UP TO. HEARING THIS IS A NUMBER FOURTEEN. DMV'S CAPITAL OUTLAY PROJECTS. CLOSE PUBLIC HEARING AND LET'S MOVE TARA LAST ITEM. ASIDE TODAY THIS IS ISSUE NUMBER FIFTEEN THE MOTOR VOTER- RESOURCES PLEASE OKAY SO THE DEPARTMENT IS REQUESTING AN AUGMENTATION FROM THE GENERAL FUND OF THIRTY EIGHT ADDITIONAL ONGOING POSITIONS AND SIX POINT FOUR MILLION IN FISCAL YEAR TWENTY TWENTY ONE. FOUR POINT NINE MILLION IN TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO F. FOUR POINT ONE THREE AND ONGOING FOR CONTINUED ADMINISTRATION OF THE MOTOR VOTER PROGRAM. ONE TIME FUNDING OF NINE HUNDRED THOUSAND IS REQUESTING IS WERE BEING REQUESTED IN FISCAL YEAR TWENTY TWENTY ONE. FOR CONTINUED INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY BETTER SUPPORT AND TRANSFER KNOWLEDGE. THE DMV HAS ADDRESSED THE NY ASSESSMENT RECOMMENDATIONS FROM AUGUST OF TWENTY NINETEEN DEPARTMENT HAS ALSO MAINTAINED A QUALITY ASSURANCE PROCESS TO ENSURE THE TIMELY RELEASE OF RECORDS TO SECRETARY OF STATE. DMV AS A SHIRT LEGAL AND COMPLIANCE RESOURCES THAT ARE ASSIGNED TO THE PROGRAM AND ESTABLISH DATA GOVERNANCE POLICIES. INCLUDING DATA RETENTION AND DATA SHARING. DEPARTMENT HAS IMPLEMENTED PROCESS IMPROVEMENTS IN THE MOTOR VOTER PROGRAM WORK FLOW INCLUDING THE LIMITATION OF CHANGE OF ADDRESS GETTING TIME AS WELL AS STREAMLINING THE PROCESS OF THE D. L. I. D. RIDDLES. THE DMV AND SECRETARY OF STATE HOW FORMED OVER GROUP TO ADDRESS ONGOING VOTER. RECORD COLLECTION PROCESSING AND DELIVERING ACTIVITIES. THE PREVIOUSLY APPROVED SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN MOTOR VOTER BCP OF TWELVE POSITIONS AND THREE POINT ONE BILLION IS NOT SUFFICIENT TO ADMINISTER AND PROCESS THE WORKLOAD ASSOCIATED WITH THE MOTOR VOTER PROGRAM. A BUDGET AUGMENTATION FROM THE GENERAL FUND IS NEEDED TO COMPLETE THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN MAINTAINED ADMINISTRATION OF THE MOTOR VOTER PROGRAM WITHOUT CONTINUING TO A DIVERSE ADVERSELY AFFECT APARTMENTS REGISTRATION AND LICENSING OPERATIONAL WORKLOADS. THIS PROPOSAL WILL ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH MEETING THE MANDATE FIVE INTENDED REQUIREMENTS. THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THE OPPORTUNITY JUST BECAUSE OUR EFFORTS AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. NET YOU HAVE WE THE TEMP. MOVE FIFTY PEOPLE OVER EVE. INCORPORATE SOME CHIU SOME OF. SO YOU HAVE SO WE RETURN AS HE TO THERE THEIR SPOT THIRTY EIGHT PLUS TWELVE REMAINS THIS THE SAME. THE QUESTION LIKE AS THESE QUESTION IS THIS PERSON WHO'S THERE ONLY DOING MOTOR VOTER- WORK. I MEAN THESE PEOPLE. I'M TRUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT I COME IN AND I CHANGE MY ADDRESS IS IN THAT I THOUGHT IT WAS JUST AN AUTOMATIC THAT WOULD GO TO THE- SECRETARY OF STATE OR TO THE COUNTY REGISTER VOTER TO DO IT. WHAT IS THE ADDITIONAL WORK THAT THAT THIS ORDER VOTER PERSON WOULD BE DOING A CHANGE OF ADDRESS FOR SUGGEST A REGULAR DMV EMPLOYEE DOING A CHANGE OF ADDRESS. OKAY SIR OKAY SUCK SO AT. THEY CAN OF GIVE AN EXAMPLE OF HOW KIND OF WORKS IF THE DONE. I'M OFFICE THIS IS THE OF GET UP. AT ME. BUT WHEN SOMEONE FILLS OUT OF ADDRESS FORM AND LET'S SAY THAT THEY OR THEY- UPDATE THEIR- ADDRESS OTHER DRIVERS LICENSE ID RENEWAL. AS IT COMES IN AT THE MOMENT IT WAS COMING IN. AND WE WOULD HAVE TO UPDATE IT INTO OUR CAN THE MOTOR VOTER IN TWO. THE DIEM SYSTEM ADD TO THE THAT GOES SECTOR OF STATE. SO THERE WAS ALL OF WORK WE US BUT THAT WE DON'T HAVE. IS THE AT THE TIME TO. AND PUTTING IT IN TO BOTH. WERE BARRING POSITIONS FOR ELSEWHERE. NOW THAT WE SECURE THE KERR FUNDING. FOR THIS YEAR. IT WAS. PROPOSED FOR NECK YEAR I DOUBT WE HAVE. RISK TO. THAT WERE LOAD UP WITH IN. BUT IS THAT MA'AM I'M CHAU MY IGNORANCE. IS THE AND- TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE. THAT'S COMPUTER WORK MEAN I GET THE I. THE WORK THAT YOU GOT TO GIVE THE NEW WHITE. AND PRINT DATA IT IS AND- OKAY HERE COME I'M HERE. PROCESSING RIDGE. AND OR WHATEVER IT IS. COMES IN I CHANGED INTO. I'M ISSUING THE CAR IN ECHO. BECAUSE OVER TO. THE REGISTER THEY SAID. STATE OR IS THAT TOO SO. OF AN UNDER. OR IN THIS. I GUESS I'M NOT APPRECIATE. APPRECIATING THE ADDITIONAL WORK. WHEN PEOPLE COME IN IN THE- COURSE OF. I NEED TO DO. TO GET MY DRIVE LICENSE AND I'M UP TO STEPPED. WE ALL KNOW THAT A LOT OF. THEIR WEIGHT INCLUDED AS THAT AN UPDATE WITH THE D. RIGHT AT THAT IN. SO IS. WELL HERE'S YOUR HERE BE FOR FIFTY POSITIONS AT 38% RIGHT SO. ALEJO WHAT DO YOU HAVE SAY SO REGARD THIS PROPOSAL I AM SAD THAT HAD ANNOUNCES WE AT RECOMMENDED THAT THE LEGISLATURE ASK FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING THE OUTCOMES OF THAT PROCESS EFFICIENCIES AS WELL AS- HOW WELL THE IDEA BE WAS ABLE TO MEET THE FIVE DAY TURNAROUND- NEAR THE VOTER REGISTRATION DEADLINE FOR THE MARCH ELECTION- SINCE THEN THE DEPARTMENT HAS BEEN ABLE TO SHOW THAT THEY'VE BEEN ABLE TO MEET THAT FIVE DAY- DEADLINES WITH THE RESOURCES. BUT WE STILL RECOMMEND I'M ASKING DEPARTMENT FOR- EDITION INFORMATION ON THE OUTCOMES OF THE PROCESS EFFICIENCIES AS THAT BECOMES FULLY IMPLEMENTED. SENATOR STIR. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- CAN YOU ELABORATE JUST ON THE E. Y. REPORT LITTLE BIT MAYBE SPEAK TO SOME OF THOSE PROCESS EFFICIENCIES JUST HELP US UNDERSTAND. THE IS THIS A VERY I. T. CENTRIC THE THIRTY EIGHT HERO A- UP THE CHAIR AND I DON'T UNDERSTAND THE DAY TODAY AND- YEAH THIS IS FOR THE NEW STREAMLINED PROCESS THAT HE Y. OUTLINE. KATHY WEBB CHIEF TO BE DIRECTOR DEPARTMENT MOTOR VEHICLES SO- IF YOU GO BACK TO THE E. Y. ASSESSMENTS THERE ARE SEVERAL THINGS THAT WERE ADDRESSED IN IN PRINCIPALLY AT A HIGH LEVEL GOVERNANCE AND HOW WE WERE WORKING WITH THE SECRETARY OF STATE- OUR OWN INTERNAL PROCESS SEES. AND I THINK WHAT LEE WAS ACTUALLY ALLUDING TO AS WELL THERE IS THE ONLINE PROCESS AND OBVIOUSLY THAT OFFER SOME EFFICIENCY BUT WE ALSO PROVIDE A CHECKS AND BALANCES BEFORE WHICH JUST SEND SOMETHING OVER. WHICH WE CALL KIND OF OUR OUR VOTER EXAMINATION TO MAKE SURE THINGS ARE ARE MEETING THE REQUIREMENTS THE SIGNATURE MATCHES ALL THOSE THINGS THAT GO ON. UNFORTUNATELY WHAT HAS BEEN MORE DIFFICULT FOR US IS THE PAPER PROCESS AND WE STILL HAVE A NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT RELY ON THE PAPER PROCESS AND WHILE WE HAVE SCANNING SYSTEMS WHICH YOU AFFORDED TO US- NOT ALL SCANNING SYSTEMS PICKUP WRITING THAT IS A LOGICAL OR INFORMATION NOT COMPLETED AND FORTY WHEN YOU HAVE. THE PAPER PROCESS YOU HAVE A CHANCE FOR WHAT I CALL MORE ERRORS THAT HAVE TO BE ADDRESSED SO IT REALLY IS CREATED INCREDIBLE WORKLOAD FOR US AND- AND WHILE I WOULD TELL YOU IT'S A SMALL FRACTION OF WHAT COMES THROUGH IN OUR PROCESSING IT DRIVES MOST OF THE MANUAL WORK. THAT WE HAVE TO DO SO- THE POSITIONS THAT WE ARE REQUESTING AS WE HAVE A WHOLE SEPARATE MOTOR VOTER SYSTEM AND SO IT'S THE I. T. KINDA MANAGEMENT IS LOOKING AT CONTINUE TO MAINTAIN IT WILL CONTINUE TO IMPROVE OUR IT SYSTEMS PROVIDE THE MONITORING THAT WE NEED TO HAVE IN IT- AND THEN THERE'S THE PROCESSING AND OUR REMITTANCE SECTION THAT STILL. IS TAKING IN THIS PAPER VOLUME- AND IN AGAIN WE DON'T DETERMINE ELIGIBILITY BUT WE TRY TO ENSURE THE QUALITY OF THE DOCUMENTS WERE SENDING OVER TO SECRETARY STATE SO THEY CAN THEM PROCESS THOSE DOCUMENTS. AND SENATOR I WOULD JUST ADD THAT DOES IT WOULD YOU HAVE THE FEDERAL APARTMENTS FOR TEN AND FIVE DAYS SO WE DON'T REALLY HAVE A CHANCE TO GO BEYOND THOSE TIME WISE WE HAVE TO ENSURE THAT THOSE TWO WRITERS ACTORS SO WHAT YOU'RE DELIVERING OVER TO SECRETARY. STATE HAS GOT TO BE. TYPE AND AS C<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt;. AS POSSIBLE.THE&lt;/c&gt;</u> AROUND THEN THAT AND IT. IN TIGHT SO. THE TEXT AND WE DID WE DID DO A QUICK LOOK BACK AS WE KIND OF. ALLEY SCUTTLED STAY. INFECTED DURING THE PRIMARY. TO ENSURE THAT HOW MUCH PERCENTAGE OF OUR RECORDS ARE ACTUALLY GOING OVER THERE. ABOUT 99% THOSE RECORDS HAVE GONE OVER AND THE ONLY REASON WHY MAY NOT BE A HOW 2% AS AN EXAMPLE. IS THAT WE DO HAVE SOME BUSINESS PROCESSES IN PLACE SAY SOMEONE IS TRYING AS IS DECEASED AND THEIR INFORMATION IS TRYING TO COME THROUGH OUR- SYSTEM FOR KICK THAT OUT. AS IF THE STATE ARE AYE HERE'S- AB. THE NEED PURSUE. BUT IT'S FAIR TO SAY THOUGH THAT EVEN THOUGH SIGNIFICANT WORKLOAD DEMAND- ACTUALLY DO MORE WORK WITH FEWER PEOPLE GOING FORWARD FROM THESE PROCESS IMPROVEMENTS THAT A FAIR ASSESSMENT OF HOW YOU'VE OUTLINED THE BUDGET HERE RIGHT AND SO WE'RE GONNA AVE ENHANCED MONITORING WHICH WILL BE IN PLACE ALL YET HAVE MORE OF LIKE A REAL TIME LOOK AT. THE LOOK OF FIX THE IT FIXING ISSUES IN REAL TIME OTHER KIND OF FLOWING FOR SYSTEMS TO MAKING SURE THAT THOSE RECORDS TO GO OVER POTS WILL HAVE LIKE A DATA REPORTING TOOL BUT I CAN KIND OF TRACK THE LIFE OF THE RECORDS.
