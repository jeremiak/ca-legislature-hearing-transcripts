INCLUDING THE VETERANS COUNCILS

00:22:08.027 --> 00:22:11.297 region:rollup2

THEY NOW WITH THAT THE MULTIPLE.

00:22:16.669 --> 00:22:19.471 region:rollup2
VETERANS HOMES THERE'S A NEED I

00:22:18.404 --> 00:22:21.273 region:rollup2
BELIEVE FOR HAVING SOME MORE

00:22:19.471 --> 00:22:23.309 region:rollup2
CONSISTENCY.

00:22:21.273 --> 00:22:25.778 region:rollup2
THROUGHOUT THE HOMES IN TERMS OF

00:22:23.309 --> 00:22:27.646 region:rollup2
THEIR REGULATIONS.

00:22:25.778 --> 00:22:29.915 region:rollup2
THESE PROCEDURES ARE ADAPTED

00:22:27.646 --> 00:22:31.383 region:rollup2
THAT ADOPTED BY REGULATION THAT

00:22:29.915 --> 00:22:33.586 region:rollup2
ACCORDING TO THE ACA

00:22:31.383 --> 00:22:34.620 region:rollup2
MINISTRATIONS TEACHERS ACT.

00:22:33.586 --> 00:22:37.256 region:rollup2
AND THERE IS FOR PUBLIC INPUT

00:22:34.620 --> 00:22:38.557 region:rollup2
ALLOWED.

00:22:37.256 --> 00:22:40.392 region:rollup2
BUT THE CHANGES THE THE

00:22:38.557 --> 00:22:44.363 region:rollup2
REGULATIONS.

00:22:40.392 --> 00:22:46.432 region:rollup2
I HAVE NOT CHANGED MUCH SINCE.

00:22:44.363 --> 00:22:48.100 region:rollup2
NINETEEN NINETY TWO AND THAT WAS

00:22:46.432 --> 00:22:49.969 region:rollup2
THE YEAR WHEN THERE WAS ONLY.

00:22:48.100 --> 00:22:51.737 region:rollup2
YEAH BILL AND NOW WITH THE MANY

00:22:49.969 --> 00:22:53.572 region:rollup2
HOMES.

00:22:51.737 --> 00:22:55.541 region:rollup2
I THINK IT WOULD BE WELL FOR US

00:22:53.572 --> 00:22:55.841 region:rollup2
TO TRY TO THE BEST WE CAN

00:22:55.541 --> 00:22:58.077 region:rollup2
[inaudible]

00:22:55.841 --> 00:22:59.778 region:rollup2
MORE STANDARDIZED.

00:22:58.077 --> 00:23:01.046 region:rollup2
SO THAT THE HEHE OF THE AND THE

00:22:59.778 --> 00:23:03.015 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATORS THOUGH ARE THE

00:23:01.046 --> 00:23:04.483 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBLE BUT WE HOLD THEM IN

00:23:03.015 --> 00:23:05.718 region:rollup2
TERMS OF THIS BILL A BIT MORE

00:23:04.483 --> 00:23:07.753 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTABLE --

00:23:05.718 --> 00:23:08.921 region:rollup2
FOR THE STANDARDIZATION.

00:23:07.753 --> 00:23:11.790 region:rollup2
OF THEIR REGULATIONS AT EACH

00:23:08.921 --> 00:23:13.192 region:rollup2
INSTITUTION.

00:23:11.790 --> 00:23:14.960 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THEN THAT --

00:23:13.192 --> 00:23:16.862 region:rollup2
AGAIN AS A PRODUCT OF JUST

00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:19.298 region:rollup2
HAVING MANY HOMES --

00:23:16.862 --> 00:23:20.466 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT TO BEING ACCUSATORY

00:23:19.298 --> 00:23:22.001 region:rollup2
MANY GIVEN HOME WITH ANY OF THE

00:23:20.466 --> 00:23:23.535 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATORS NOT GOING TO BE

00:23:22.001 --> 00:23:25.204 region:rollup2
DOING THE JOB.

00:23:23.535 --> 00:23:26.872 region:rollup2
BUT I THINK IT'S THE MOST

00:23:25.204 --> 00:23:29.909 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT THING TO ME.

00:23:26.872 --> 00:23:30.743 region:rollup2
IS TO ALLOW THE VETERANS TO HAVE

00:23:29.909 --> 00:23:31.043 region:rollup2
THE PEACE AND COMFORT

00:23:30.743 --> 00:23:32.144 region:rollup2
[inaudible]

00:23:31.043 --> 00:23:34.079 region:rollup2
THAT EVERYTHING.

00:23:32.144 --> 00:23:37.816 region:rollup2
IS THE SAME.

00:23:34.079 --> 00:23:38.884 region:rollup2
AND THEY ARE SECURE.

00:23:37.816 --> 00:23:40.452 region:rollup2
BUT ALSO WE GET IT WOULD IT

00:23:38.884 --> 00:23:42.221 region:rollup2
WOULD IMPLEMENTED NOT TONIC

00:23:40.452 --> 00:23:43.923 region:rollup2
HEALTH RECORD SYSTEM.

00:23:42.221 --> 00:23:45.925 region:rollup2
THAT IS IT FOR THE ALL OF THESE

00:23:43.923 --> 00:23:47.993 region:rollup2
INSTITUTIONS AS WELL --

00:23:45.925 --> 00:23:51.430 region:rollup2
THAT IS THE FUTURE THAT'S

00:23:47.993 --> 00:23:54.366 region:rollup2
ALREADY UPON US AND HEALTH CARE.

00:23:51.430 --> 00:23:55.200 region:rollup2
AND THE ADOPTION OF HEALTH CARE.

00:23:54.366 --> 00:23:57.636 region:rollup2
RIDERS WITH.

00:23:55.200 --> 00:24:00.005 region:rollup2
INTEREST AND ACCESS TO THESE THE

00:23:57.636 --> 00:24:01.874 region:rollup2
THIS TECHNOLOGY IF YOU WILL --

00:24:00.005 --> 00:24:03.642 region:rollup2

TELECONFERENCE CONCETTA.

00:24:07.146 --> 00:24:10.349 region:rollup2
I THINK THIS WOULD BE HELPFUL

00:24:08.614 --> 00:24:11.583 region:rollup2
BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT FIND

00:24:10.349 --> 00:24:13.218 region:rollup2
FUNDAMENTAL ISSUE IS TO ENSURE

00:24:11.583 --> 00:24:14.453 region:rollup2
CONSISTENCY.

00:24:13.218 --> 00:24:15.621 region:rollup2

NINETEEN NEXT SESSION. TWENTY

00:37:47.932 --> 00:37:51.436 region:rollup2
TWENTY EARLY --

00:37:49.801 --> 00:37:54.439 region:rollup2
THE AND THAT LEADS DIRECTLY INTO

00:37:51.436 --> 00:37:56.341 region:rollup2
MY LAST QUESTION --

00:37:54.439 --> 00:37:58.409 region:rollup2
IN MY SYNOPSIS IS SAYS REQUIRES

00:37:56.341 --> 00:38:00.111 region:rollup2
CALVET TO BEGIN ADOPTING THE

00:37:58.409 --> 00:38:02.747 region:rollup2
PLAN RECOMMENDATIONS BY JULY

00:38:00.111 --> 00:38:03.381 region:rollup2
FIRST.

00:38:02.747 --> 00:38:08.019 region:rollup2
TWENTY TWENTY IN THE BIG PICTURE

00:38:03.381 --> 00:38:10.755 region:rollup2
--

00:38:08.019 --> 00:38:12.857 region:rollup2
THAT MAY INTERFERE WITH THE

00:38:10.755 --> 00:38:14.959 region:rollup2
SCHEDULING OF ADOPTING ANY

00:38:12.857 --> 00:38:17.562 region:rollup2
CHANGES OR UPGRADES OR

00:38:14.959 --> 00:38:18.530 region:rollup2
DOWNGRADES. TO THE VETERANS

00:38:17.562 --> 00:38:20.031 region:rollup2
HOMES AND THE WHOLE CALVET

00:38:18.530 --> 00:38:22.567 region:rollup2
SYSTEM.

00:38:20.031 --> 00:38:24.369 region:rollup2
SO MY MY ONE CONCERN WHERE THERE

00:38:22.567 --> 00:38:27.238 region:rollup2
WAS IF WE PUT A JULY FIRST HARD

00:38:24.369 --> 00:38:28.706 region:rollup2
DATE. ONE CALVET THAT MIGHT

00:38:27.238 --> 00:38:30.809 region:rollup2
INTERFERE WITH QUITE A FEW OF

00:38:28.706 --> 00:38:32.911 region:rollup2
THEIR OTHER OPERATIONS AND THEY

00:38:30.809 --> 00:38:34.746 region:rollup2

FOR THE CALVERT SYSTEM.

00:38:41.319 --> 00:38:44.923 region:rollup2
SO THAT WAS MY CONCERN IS IF YOU

00:38:43.188 --> 00:38:47.725 region:rollup2
HAVE.

00:38:44.923 --> 00:38:49.060 region:rollup2
ONE HARD AND FAST DATE BUT YET

00:38:47.725 --> 00:38:51.529 region:rollup2
THE OTHER DATES ARE RELATIVELY

00:38:49.060 --> 00:38:58.269 region:rollup2
OPEN -- THAT

00:38:51.529 --> 00:39:00.705 region:rollup2
WOULD BE CONFUSING THE CALVERT.

00:38:58.269 --> 00:39:03.041 region:rollup2
SO A ASSEMBLYMAN --

00:39:00.705 --> 00:39:04.709 region:rollup2

00:39:07.712 --> 00:39:12.183 region:rollup2
THE MASTER PLAN ONLY REQUIRES
