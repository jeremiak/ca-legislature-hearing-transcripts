.

00:49:27.565 --> 00:49:31.302 region:rollup2
ASSEMBLYMEMBER GARCIA FOR A

00:49:29.934 --> 00:49:33.504 region:rollup2
BRING THIS RESOLUTION FORWARD

00:49:31.302 --> 00:49:34.438 region:rollup2
<u><c.red>T'S A VERY IMPORTANT RESOLUTION</c></u>

00:49:33.504 --> 00:49:36.140 region:rollup2
AND I THINK WE'VE DONE A NUMBER

00:49:34.438 --> 00:49:37.842 region:rollup2
OF THINGS ON THIS FLOOR TO IN

00:49:36.140 --> 00:49:40.110 region:rollup2
TERMS OF SOCIAL JUSTICE TO TALK

00:49:37.842 --> 00:49:41.512 region:rollup2
ABOUT GANGS AND. AND LIST AND

00:49:40.110 --> 00:49:43.113 region:rollup2
ALL THOSE KINDS OF THINGS BUT

00:49:41.512 --> 00:49:44.782 region:rollup2
ONE OF THINGS I THINK WE ALL

00:49:43.113 --> 00:49:47.218 region:rollup2
AGREE UPON IS THAT NO COMMUNITY

00:49:44.782 --> 00:49:49.653 region:rollup2
SHOULD EVER BE IN IN CONTROL OF

00:49:47.218 --> 00:49:51.555 region:rollup2
BY GANGS. NO COMPLETELY SHOULD

00:49:49.653 --> 00:49:53.390 region:rollup2
EVER FEEL A SENSE OF LOSS AND

00:49:51.555 --> 00:49:54.725 region:rollup2
AND HOPELESSNESS BECAUSE OF THE

00:49:53.390 --> 00:49:56.193 region:rollup2
GANGS IN THEIR COMMUNITY. I

00:49:54.725 --> 00:49:58.562 region:rollup2
THINK WE'VE ALL BEEN AFFECTED BY

00:49:56.193 --> 00:50:00.164 region:rollup2
GANG VIOLENCE WE'VE ALL HAD THE

00:49:58.562 --> 00:50:03.067 region:rollup2
THE FRIENDS OR FAMILY SO

00:50:00.164 --> 00:50:04.301 region:rollup2
CONSTITUENTS WHO LOST THEIR

00:50:03.067 --> 00:50:05.903 region:rollup2
LIVES ARE WHO'VE EITHER JUST

00:50:04.301 --> 00:50:07.204 region:rollup2
BEEN INTIMIDATED. BY THE GANG

00:50:05.903 --> 00:50:09.573 region:rollup2
VIOLENCE THAT EXISTS IN OUR

00:50:07.204 --> 00:50:11.108 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES BUT I THINK ONE OF

00:50:09.573 --> 00:50:14.111 region:rollup2
THE THINGS WE'VE LEARNED AND

00:50:11.108 --> 00:50:17.114 region:rollup2
I'VE WORKED WITH A LOT OF GANG

00:50:14.111 --> 00:50:19.717 region:rollup2
UGH ARE ANTI GAY GROUPS AS WELL

00:50:17.114 --> 00:50:21.519 region:rollup2
AS FORMER GANG MEMBERS. ONE OF

00:50:19.717 --> 00:50:25.556 region:rollup2
THE THINGS I'VE LEARNED OVER THE

00:50:21.519 --> 00:50:25.990 region:rollup2
YEARS IS THAT GANG GANG VIOLENCE

00:50:25.556 --> 00:50:27.358 region:rollup2
AND GANG ACTIVITY IS

00:50:25.990 --> 00:50:28.826 region:rollup2
PREVENTABLE.

00:50:27.358 --> 00:50:30.361 region:rollup2
IT IT STANDS VERY EARLY IN LIFE

00:50:28.826 --> 00:50:31.328 region:rollup2
FROM A NOT HAVING THAT SCHOOLS

00:50:30.361 --> 00:50:32.396 region:rollup2
THAT ARE SUPPORTIVE. NOT HAVING

00:50:31.328 --> 00:50:33.530 region:rollup2
FAMILIES THAT ARE SUPPORTIVE

00:50:32.396 --> 00:50:34.899 region:rollup2
HAVING FAMILIES TO WORK SO MANY

00:50:33.530 --> 00:50:35.866 region:rollup2
HOURS EVERY DAY THAT THEY DON'T

00:50:34.899 --> 00:50:37.268 region:rollup2
HAVE THE TIME AND ENERGY TO

00:50:35.866 --> 00:50:38.002 region:rollup2
INVEST IN THEIR CHILDREN. NOT

00:50:37.268 --> 00:50:39.537 region:rollup2
HAVING THE KIND OF PARK AND

00:50:38.002 --> 00:50:40.638 region:rollup2
RECREATION PROGRAMS THAT NURTURE

00:50:39.537 --> 00:50:41.906 region:rollup2
AND CARE FOR CHILDREN SO WE KNOW

00:50:40.638 --> 00:50:42.973 region:rollup2
THAT IT IS PREVENTABLE. THAT WE

00:50:41.906 --> 00:50:43.874 region:rollup2
CAN SAVE A LOT OF LIVES AND WE

00:50:42.973 --> 00:50:44.942 region:rollup2
CAN SAVE A LOT OF MONEY WITH

00:50:43.874 --> 00:50:46.277 region:rollup2
REGARDS TO BASICALLY SIMPLY

00:50:44.942 --> 00:50:48.112 region:rollup2
INVESTING IN YOUNG PEOPLE EARLY

00:50:46.277 --> 00:50:49.680 region:rollup2
ENOUGH. TO HELP TO PREVENT THAT

00:50:48.112 --> 00:50:51.215 region:rollup2
THE STRENGTHENING OUR FAMILIES

00:50:49.680 --> 00:50:53.017 region:rollup2
AND GIVING THEM AN OPPORTUNITY

00:50:51.215 --> 00:50:54.084 region:rollup2
TO BASICALLY BE THE FAMILIES

00:50:53.017 --> 00:50:56.053 region:rollup2
THEY WANT TO BE WHICH IS TO

00:50:54.084 --> 00:50:57.488 region:rollup2
SUPPORT IT NURTURE OUR CHILDREN.

00:50:56.053 --> 00:51:00.224 region:rollup2
WE'VE LEARNED THAT A LOT OF LOVE

00:50:57.488 --> 00:51:01.392 region:rollup2
IT LLOYD MORE INCARCERATION. OF

00:51:00.224 --> 00:51:02.793 region:rollup2
MORE VIOLENCE DOESN'T IN THAT IN

00:51:01.392 --> 00:51:04.695 region:rollup2
ESSENCE DOES NOT SOLVE THE

00:51:02.793 --> 00:51:05.930 region:rollup2
PROBLEM. I'VE SEEN IN MY OWN

00:51:04.695 --> 00:51:08.065 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY WHERE WITH IT'S A

00:51:05.930 --> 00:51:09.833 region:rollup2
CYCLE WHERE. WE HAVE SOME GANG

00:51:08.065 --> 00:51:11.368 region:rollup2
INTERVENTION AND WE ROUND UP ALL

00:51:09.833 --> 00:51:13.938 region:rollup2
THE GANG MEMBERS WE PUT HIM IN

00:51:11.368 --> 00:51:16.240 region:rollup2
JAIL FOR A CERTAIN PERIOD OF

00:51:13.938 --> 00:51:18.976 region:rollup2
TIME AND THEN YOU SIDE FIND THE

00:51:16.240 --> 00:51:20.377 region:rollup2
GANG VIOLENCE STARTS AGAIN. AND

00:51:18.976 --> 00:51:23.347 region:rollup2
I ASK THE QUESTION WHY DID IT

00:51:20.377 --> 00:51:25.683 region:rollup2
START AGAIN WHAT'S WHAT'S GOING

00:51:23.347 --> 00:51:27.985 region:rollup2
ON A SAID WELL ALL THE GANG

00:51:25.683 --> 00:51:30.254 region:rollup2
MEMBERS JUST GOT OUT OF JAIL.

00:51:27.985 --> 00:51:32.089 region:rollup2
AND SO IT BEGINS AGAIN AND SO WE

00:51:30.254 --> 00:51:36.260 region:rollup2
HAVE DONE VERY LITTLE NOT ONLY

00:51:32.089 --> 00:51:39.129 region:rollup2
IN OUR COMMUNITIES BUT ALSO WHEN

00:51:36.260 --> 00:51:42.132 region:rollup2
THOSE WERE PART CAR SERRATED TO

00:51:39.129 --> 00:51:44.768 region:rollup2
BASICALLY BEGAN TO THE LEVEL OF

00:51:42.132 --> 00:51:48.973 region:rollup2
INTERVENTION THERE. SO IT IS

00:51:44.768 --> 00:51:50.908 region:rollup2
PREVENTABLE AND WE AS AS A AS A

00:51:48.973 --> 00:51:53.243 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIANS NEED TO LOOK AT

00:51:50.908 --> 00:51:56.547 region:rollup2
THIS VERY CAREFULLY RATHER THAN

00:51:53.243 --> 00:51:59.984 region:rollup2
RUNNING AWAY FROM IT. WE NEED TO

00:51:56.547 --> 00:52:04.288 region:rollup2
EMBRACE IT. ISIS SAY TO MY

00:51:59.984 --> 00:52:04.922 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES WHEN. WHEN THEY WILL

00:52:04.288 --> 00:52:09.360 region:rollup2
TALK COUSINS EASE OF THE PEOPLE

00:52:04.922 --> 00:52:11.028 region:rollup2
NEXT

00:52:09.360 --> 00:52:12.630 region:rollup2
DOOR. WE HAVE TO BEGIN TO

00:52:11.028 --> 00:52:13.597 region:rollup2
EMBRACE THEM AND HELP THEM

00:52:12.630 --> 00:52:15.099 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND THAT THERE IS

00:52:13.597 --> 00:52:16.500 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY THERE IS HOPE

00:52:15.099 --> 00:52:17.434 region:rollup2
THERE'S A CHANCE FOR GROWTH AND

00:52:16.500 --> 00:52:19.703 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENT RATHER THAN RUNNING

00:52:17.434 --> 00:52:20.738 region:rollup2
AWAY. THESE ARE CHILDREN WHO

00:52:19.703 --> 00:52:22.106 region:rollup2
WOULD TWO AND THREE IS ALL THAT

00:52:20.738 --> 00:52:24.241 region:rollup2
WE SHOULD HAVE EMBRACED EARLY IN

00:52:22.106 --> 00:52:26.210 region:rollup2
LIFE SO THEY COULD SEEK US SO I

00:52:24.241 --> 00:52:27.111 region:rollup2
ENCOURAGE ALL OF OUR COMMUNITIES

00:52:26.210 --> 00:52:28.812 region:rollup2

RESOURCES TO MAKE SURE THAT WE

00:52:33.651 --> 00:52:36.987 region:rollup2
HAVE GANG INTERVENTION PROGRAMS.

00:52:35.686 --> 00:52:39.256 region:rollup2
THAT ARE ADEQUATELY FUNDED IN

00:52:36.987 --> 00:52:40.357 region:rollup2
OUR COMMUNITIES NOT JUST BECAUSE

00:52:39.256 --> 00:52:42.126 region:rollup2

00:52:42.126 --> 00:52:46.030 region:rollup2
ENSURES THE CALIFORNIA BECOMES A

00:52:44.428 --> 00:52:48.032 region:rollup2
