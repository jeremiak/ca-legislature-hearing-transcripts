FLETCHER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. SORRY APPARENTLY WE SWITCHED BILLS -- GOOD MORNING MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS SENATE BILL EIGHT TWENTY WOULD BAN SECRET SETTLEMENTS AND SEXUAL HARASSMENT SEXUAL ASSAULT IN SEX DISCRIMINATION CASES. THIS BILL WILL EMPOWER VICTIMS BY ALLOWING THEM TO REQUEST CONFIDENTIALITY CURRENTLY CALIFORNIA LAW DOES NOT ENFORCE CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENTS IF THEY INVOLVE A FELONY CHARGE OF SEXUAL ASSAULT OR RAPE. IN CASES OF ELDER INDEPENDENT ADULT ABUSE SO EIGHT S. B. EIGHT TWENTY TAKES THE NEXT LOGICAL STEP BY COVERING ALL CASES OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT ASSAULT AND DISCRIMINATION. IS WE'VE CLEARLY SEEN OVER THE LAST YEARS ME TWO MOVEMENT HAS GAINED MOMENTUM SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND OTHER TYPES OF NON FELONY SEXUAL ASSAULT ARE STILL ALLOWED TO BE HIDDEN FROM PUBLIC AYE. BE A SECRET SETTLEMENTS IN SHORT SECRETS UNMANNED SETTLEMENTS HELP. PERPETRATORS EVADE JUSTICE. WE ALL DESERVE TO LIVE AND WORK FREE FROM SEXUAL HARASSMENT ASSAULT DISCRIMINATION AND SP EIGHT TWENTY ONE POWER VICTIMS SO THAT THEY CAN NOT THOSE THAT RASTER ATTACK THEM CAN DECIDE WHAT IS BEST FOR THEM. I RESPECTFULLY ASK THREE I'VE. MS MELENDEZ YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER -- AYE THERE'S A COUPLE THINGS WITH THIS BILL I THINK WE ALL AGREE. THAT SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE DONE WITH RESPECT TO SEXUAL HARASSMENT WHETHER IT'S IN THIS BUILDING OR WHETHER IT'S IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR. BUT THERE'S ONE THING TO CONSIDER WITH THIS BILL INDICTS -- SOMETIMES PEOPLE WANT THAT CONFIDENTIALITY. SOMETIMES THEY DON'T WANT WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO THEM TO BE PUBLIC AND THEY WANT TO SETTLE. WITH THEIR EMPLOYER -- YOU KNOW WHAT WITHOUT HAVING IT PERHAPS MADE PUBLIC ARE SPLASHED ACROSS THE PAPERS AND I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING WE TO BE VERY CAREFUL. ABOUT TAKING AWAY FROM THEM I'M I AGREE THAT IT IS -- NOT APPROPRIATE WHEN SOMEONE IS BULLIED INTO IT HOWEVER THERE ARE TIMES WHEN THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT AN EMPLOYEE WANTS. THE SECOND POINT THAT I WILL BRING UP WITH THIS BILL IS THAT IT. DOES NOT AND APPLY TO GOVERNMENT AGENCIES. SO I'M NOT SURE WHY WE WOULD APPLY THESE TYPES OF ROLES. TO THE PRIVATE SECTOR BUT NOT TO OURSELVES AND TO GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND I RECOGNIZE THAT WE ARE. TRYING TO WHAT KIND OF ATTACK THIS PROBLEM AT ALL FRIENDS WE CAN'T DO EVERYTHING ALL AT ONCE BUT IT'S HYPOCRITICAL FOR US TO PASS A BILL LIKE THIS AND SAY IT'S GOOD FOR YOU BUT NOT FOR US I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING I COULD HAVE BEEN ADDRESSED VERY EASILY IN THIS BILL BUT I WASN'T SO. FOR THOSE REASONS -- I WOULD ASK FOR A NO VOTE. THANK YOU MS MELENDEZ SEEING NO ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OR DEBATE. MS GONZALEZ FLETCHER YOU MAKE LOVE THINK ILL AND THIS BILL IS RECENTLY AMENDED WOULD ALLOW THE VICTIM TO REQUEST TO KEEP CONFIDENTIAL ANY PERSONAL INFORMATION THAT COULD REVEAL THE VICTIMS IDENTITIES. SO I THINK IT'S CLEAR THAT THE AMENDMENTS TAKEN -- FIRST OF ALL DO YOU DO ADDRESS THE FIRST [inaudible] PROBLEM THE SECOND PROVISION HAS BEEN AMENDED TO ENSURE. THAT EVEN THAT'S MORE LIMITED CONFIDENTIALLY PROVISION WOULD NOT APPLY WHERE ONE PARTY TO THE AGREEMENT IS A PUBLIC OFFICIAL OR GOVERNMENT ENTITY. THIS AMENDMENT RESPONSE TO CONCERNS FROM THE NEWSPAPER INDUSTRY THAT GOVERNMENT RECORDS MUST BE AVAILABLE FOR PUBLIC THROUGH THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC RECORDS ACT WHICH IS EXISTING LAW. SO HOPEFULLY -- PEOPLE READ THE BILL AND THE AMENDMENTS AND WILL VOTE ACCORDINGLY I RESPECTFULLY ASK ABOUT. WITHOUT THE CLERK WILL CALL THE ROLL. THIS OUT OF VOTE ON MEMBERS VOTERS ARE TO VOTE.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS. I RISE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS AS STRONG SUPPORT. OF AS J. ARE FOURTEEN AND THANK SENATOR GLAZER FOR BRINGING UP THIS RESOLUTION BEFORE US TODAY. IT IS NOTED THAT THE CONFEDERATE GENERAL ROBERT E. LEE'S SAID THAT. HE WAS OPPOSED TO EXIT OUT OF SEEING. CONFEDERATE MONUMENTS BECAUSE IT WOULD KEEP OPEN THE SOURCE OF WAR [inaudible] AND MAN WE WE LOOK. YOUR ATTENTION MISTER GIBSON. AND WHEN WE LOOK AT THE STATE. OF THE COUNTRY TODAY. IT IS LIKE A BATTLEGROUND. CHILDREN ARE BEING STRIPPED AWAY FROM THEIR PARENTS. PEOPLE ARE BEING TARGETED BECAUSE THEY'RE MUSLIMS UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS LIVES. LIVES ARE BEING TURNED AROUND THE LAND AS STAGE POINT OF ORDER -- MISTER SPEAKER I THINK THAT. AND THE MEMBER IS STRAYING FAR FROM WHAT THIS RESOLUTION IS ABOUT THIS IS ABOUT. CONFEDERATE NAMES AND STATUES BEING REMOVED FROM BUILDINGS IN MEAN PLACED IN MUSEUMS THIS ISN'T ABOUT IMMIGRATION OR ANYTHING. RELATED TO THAT'S I WOULD JUST ASK THAT THE SPEAKER STICK TO THE SUBJECT AT HAND. MS MELENDEZ -- THE POINT OF ORDER IS NOT WELL TAKEN I BELIEVE THE SPEAKER THE OUT -- MISTER GIBSON IS PROVIDING SOME GENERAL CONTEXT THAT IS RELEVANT -- TO THE RESOLUTION I'M GOING TO SAY POINT OF ORDERS NOW TAKEN. MISTER GIBSON YOU MAY PROCEED -- IN THE SPIRIT OF OF THE ITEM THAT'S BEFORE. THE BY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER SPEAKER. CHILDREN ARE BEING STRIPPED AWAY FROM THEIR PARENTS. PEOPLE ARE BEING TARGETED BECAUSE THEY'RE MUSLIMS. UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS LIVES LIVES HAVE BEEN TURNED UPSIDE DOWN AND THEY'VE BEEN PUSHED IN THE SHADOWS. TRADE WARS ARE TAKING PLACE WITH OUR ALLIES. THE SORES OF OF OUR HISTORIES. ARE ONLY BEING RE OPEN BECAUSE OF WHAT'S TAKING PLACE WITH THESE MONUMENTS. MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS ARE% RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE ON S. J. ARE. FOURTEEN THEY WAS GIPSON. MISTER GALLAGHER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED YEAH MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS YOU KNOW THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF DISCUSSION OVER THIS SAID WE HAD BILLS [inaudible] LAST SESSION. I'M I THINK THE IMPORTANT THING IS THAT WE DON'T FORGET OUR HISTORY. WE DON'T FORGET. THE NEGATIVE ASPECTS OF OUR SYSTEM HISTORY AND WE NEED. TO UNDERSTAND WHAT HAPPENED THERE WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT IT -- BUT WHAT THIS DOES WHAT THESE KIND OF MEASURES DO. TO ME IS A SENSOR HISTORY. AS I SAY HEY YOU KNOW WE'RE GOING TO JUST REMOVE THIS AND AND TO ME THAT MEANS THAT YOU DON'T TALK ABOUT THOSE THINGS YOU DON'T TALK ABOUT WHAT OCCURRED. YOU KNOW DURING -- THE CIVIL WAR. AND TO ME THAT'S NOT THE RIGHT THING TO DO AND IN FACT. WE NO BECAUSE WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS THAT. PEOPLE IN HISTORY ARE COMPLICATED. FIGURES IN HISTORY ARE VERY COMPLICATED. YOU CAN'T TALK ABOUT ROBERT E. LEE AND JUST TALK ABOUT THE CIVIL WAR. YOU KNOW BECAUSE HE WAS A VERY COMPLEX PERSON WHO. WHO DID A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS? THEY CONTRIBUTED. TO THIS NATION AND SO. TO ME TO TO OVERSIMPLIFY AND SIMPLY SAY HEY LOOK BECAUSE SOMEONE'S. PART OF THE CONFEDERACY THERE'S THE STATUE SOMEWHERE THAT WE SHOULD REMOVE THAT [inaudible] TO ME. TAKES AWAY THE OPPORTUNITY TO TALK ABOUT OUR HISTORY. AND TALK ABOUT AND TALK ABOUT THESE FIGURES. THINK ABOUT WHERE YOU'RE GOING WITH THIS. BECAUSE WE CAN GO WE CAN GO DOWN OF WE CAN GO DOWN THE LINE HERE. YOU WE COULD WE COULD TALK ABOUT -- NO FIGURES IN OUR OWN HISTORY WHO HAVE NAMES THAT NAMES UP ON SCHOOLS WHO HAVE NAMES UP ON BUILDINGS. WHO MADE SOME BIG MISTAKES? WHO DID SOME VERY NEGATIVE THINGS LET'S LET'S TALK ABOUT JAPANESE INTERMENT AND WHO PLAYED A VERY BIG ROLE IN THAT? THE FORMER GOVERNOR OF THE STATE OF A SUPREME COURT JUSTICE THAT MANY PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE AISLE CELEBRATE. BUT WHO WAS VERY INSTRUMENTAL IN PUTTING THE JAPANESE AMERICANS IN INTERNMENT CAMPS. SHOULD WE REMOVE HIS NAME. HEY ASHBURY AND SAN FRANCISCO IS NAMED AFTER GOVERNOR HATE. LOT OF LOT OF RACIST. COMMENTS COMING OUT OF HIM IF YOU LOOK BACK ON THE HISTORY OF THAT SHOULD WE CHANGE THE NAME OF PAID ASH VERY. I MEAN HOW FAR DO YOU WANT TO TAKE THIS. IT'S SOMETHING TO REALLY THINK ABOUT DO YOU WANT TO CENSOR HISTORY BECAUSE YOU KNOW. BECAUSE ALL OF A SUDDEN THAT YOU WANT TO DISAGREE WITH THAT -- THOSE ARE THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT. ART ARE DANGEROUS TO FIRST AMENDMENT [inaudible] I THINK -- AND SO LOOK I THINK YOU SHOULD LOOK AT FIGURES IN HISTORY COMPLICATED FIGURES THAT THEY ARE. RIGHT AND HAVE THAT DISCUSSION AND TALK ABOUT. YOU CAN'T PUT PEOPLE INTO A TWENTY FIRST CENTURY. VIEWPOINT WHEN THEY LIVED IN A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT TIME THEN YOU AT ALL YOU AND I'LL DO IT. RIGHT AND I THINK TROOP TO PEOPLE WHO ARE TRUE TRULY -- INTERESTED IN HISTORY AN INSTANT TALKING ABOUT HISTORY AND TALKING ABOUT HOW WE GET BETTER. AND HOW WE IMPROVE UPON OUR DEMOCRACY. WOULD AGREE WITH THAT. SO I WOULD URGES BODY TO BE VERY THOUGHTFUL ABOUT THIS I WOULD REJECT THIS THIS POLICY OF CENSORSHIP. AND LET'S HAVE THE RICH DIALOGUE THAT I THINK A LOT OF US WANNA HAVE ABOUT OUR HISTORY THANK YOU. SEEING NO ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION I'M SORRY. SHE'S THE AUTHOR. I'M LOOKING FOR ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OR DEBATE THANK YOU MEMBERS DOCTOR WEBER. YOU'RE RECOGNIZED YES MADAM MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS I RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS RESOLUTION. YOU KNOW I THINK THAT. WHEN ONE LOOKS AT HISTORY NOT JUST U. S. ISSUE BUT HISTORY IN GENERAL? YOU GENERALLY DON'T CELEBRATE THOSE WHO ARE CONSIDERED TRAITORS. AND IT'S NO POINT US PRETENDING THAT THE CIVIL WAR WAS SOME LITTLE INCIDENT THAT OCCURRED. IT WAS A DIRECT ATTACK UPON THIS NATION AND WHAT THE NATION STOOD FOR WEATHER WAS PRO AGAINST SLAVERY THIS WAS A DIVISION IN THE NATION. AN ATTEMPT TO OVERTHROW THE GOVERNMENT SO LESS NOT PRETENDED TO SOME WILL PARTY THAT TOOK PLACE BUT THERE WERE A COUPLE OF PEOPLE WITH A FEW IDEAS AND A COUPLE OTHER THINGS THIS WAS A MAJOR EVENT IN THIS COUNTRY. THAT CHALLENGE THE DEMOCRACY WE DON'T HAVE STATUES THAT I KNOW OF TO BENEDICT ARNOLD. AND PROBABLY IF WE PUT ONE UP FOLKS WOULD BE UPSET. NOW THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THAT I'M LOOKING OVER LOOKING ALL OF THE RACISM IN THIS COUNTRY AND ALL OF THOSE WHO PARTICIPATED IN RACES ACTIVITIES AS WE TALK ABOUT THE SIXTIES ALL WE TALK ABOUT. THE CIVIL WAR ITSELF WHAT WE TALK ABOUT THE SLAVE TRADE. WE UNDERSTAND THAT THERE WILL ALWAYS SOME ISSUES AND SOME CONFLICTS THAT INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE PHILOSOPHIES AND IDEAS THAT WOULD DIFFERENT THAN OURS. BUT THIS IS A MAJOR EVENT IN THIS COUNTRY. AND WE SHOULD NOT THINK OF IT ANY DIFFERENT THAN NORTH AND SOUTH KOREA. WHILE THE OTHER VIETNAM IN THE DIVISION THAT WAS THEIR THIS WAS THEY'D ATTACK UPON THE DEMOCRACY IN WHICH IT EXISTED AT THAT TIME. AND IT CREATED A WAR THAT WAS A WAR BETWEEN THE STATES AND IT IS NOT JUST A MINOR INCIDENT. NOT SHOULD WE TEACH ABOUT THIS MOST DEFINITELY. WE SHOULD TEACH ABOUT IT IN OUR MUSEUMS IN OUR HISTORY BOOKS AND WE SHOULD NEVER TAKE THIS OUT OF OUR HISTORY BOOKS. BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT TO WASH HISTORY AWAY SO THE PEOPLE NEVER LEARN FROM THE PAST. BUT WHEN I SEE A MONUMENT WHEN I GET ON A HIGHWAY OR FREEWAY I BELIEVE AT SOME POINT THAT I AM CELEBRATING THAT INDIVIDUAL WHOSE NAME IS ON AND THAT'S WHY WE NAME THINGS AFTER PEOPLE. AND SOMETIMES WE FIGHT ABOUT THE NAMES IN SOME COMMUNITIES IS WHOSE NAME SHOULD BE THERE THAT SHOULD NOT BE THERE NOT BECAUSE IT'S AN INSIGNIFICANT EVENT BUT BECAUSE IT IS AN IMPORTANT ELEMENT THAT WE WOULD WANT TO TEACH OUR CHILDREN EVEN WITHOUT A STILL LESSEN. WOULD THEY SHOULD BECOME WHAT THEY SHOULD ASPIRE TO BE AND WHAT IT MEANS TO BE A GREAT AMERICAN. AND SO AS WE TALK ABOUT THIS LET'S NOT WASH IT DOWN THAT IS JUST AN EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCE. QUESTION OF THE CONFEDERACY AND THE CIVIL RIGHTS OF THE CIVIL WAR IN THIS COUNTRY WAS A MAJOR EVENT. THAT NOT ONLY DETERMINE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO THOSE WHO WERE ENSLAVED BUT DETERMINE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO THIS DEMOCRACY. AND WE SHOULD FIGHT FOR THAT EVERY DAY AND THOSE WHO ARE OPPOSED TO IT WE SHOULD BASICALLY DEAL WITH THEM AGGRESSIVELY AND NOT. SOMETIME OTHER MAKE IT SOUND SO ROMANTIC OF WHAT HAPPENED AT THAT PARTICULAR TIME I STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS RESOLUTION I SUPPOSE I STRONGLY SUPPORT US HAVING CONVERSATIONS ALWAYS ABOUT THIS ISSUE. THAT THOSE INDIVIDUALS NAME SHOULD BE THERE IN TERMS OF TOTAL CONTRIBUTION BUT THEIR EFFORTS TO DESTROY THIS NATION SHOULD NEVER BE FORGOTTEN AND SHOULD NEVER BE WASHED AWAY. I RESPECTFULLY ASK WHEN I VOTE FOR THIS RESOLUTION. THE DECK WEBER MISTER MATHIS YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THEY WITH FEAR MEMBERS. IN OTHER THERE'S A LOT OF SCENES OUT THERE THERE'S A LOT OF QUOTES OUT THERE ABOUT REMEMBERING IN OUR HISTORY. AND IN THE MILITARY WE SAY LET'S NEVER FORGET. LET'S NEVER FORGET THOSE WILL PASSED Y. THEY PASSED IN WHAT IT WAS ABOUT. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE HOLOCAUST WE TALK ABOUT LET'S NEVER FORGET? BUT WE DON'T TALK ABOUT REMOVING ALL OF THEIR HISTORY AND THROWN INTO A MUSEUM [inaudible] IS IMPORTANT. THAT WE REMEMBER. THE IS A GENERATION THAT FORGETS IT'S PAST. GETS ITS HISTORY. IS DOOMED TO REPEAT IT. AND THAT'S A FACT OF HISTORY. SO LET'S NOT TRY TO SHUFFLE AWAY THE THINGS WE WANNA KICK UNDER THE CARPET UNDER THE RUG AND DON'T WANT TO LOOK AT SO WE CAN FORGET ABOUT WHAT WAS DONE. IT'S REMEMBER IT. LET'S HAVE IT THERE THAT WE CAN HAVE IT IN CONTEXT. AND LET'S REMEMBER AND LEARN FROM THESE LESSONS. THURMOND YOUR RECOGNIZE. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS ARISES BOARD THAT SHE ARE. FOURTEEN GROSS WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT THIS MEASURE. I WOULD ENCOURAGE MY COLLEAGUES TO BE CAREFUL TO THE REFERENCES THAT YOU CHOOSE TO MAKE IN DEFENDING. YOUR INTERESTS IN VOTING THIS DOWN. TO MAKE A REFERENCE TO THE HOLOCAUST [inaudible] IN COMPARISON. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT [inaudible] INDIVIDUALS [inaudible] CREATED. MASS SLAUGHTER MILLIONS OF INDIVIDUALS THERE KNOW SCHOOLS NAMED AFTER THOSE INDIVIDUALS NOR SHOULD THERE BE. THOSE ARE CRIMINAL ACTS. ALL THIS MEASURE IS SAYING. IS THAT WE SHOULD BE THOUGHTFUL. ABOUT THE BUILDINGS THAT WE NAME. SCHOOLS THAT OUR CHILDREN GO. TO AND THAT IT HAS AN IMPACT ON THEM WHEN THEY GOING TO A SCHOOL THAT IS NAMED AFTER SOMEONE. WHO STOOD AGAINST THEIR VERY BEING? BUT THIS IS A DEMOCRACY AND YOU MAY VOTE HOW YOU WANT. BUT LET'S NOT USE THIS MEASURE OR THIS FLOOR. TO MAKE REFERENCES TO THOSE WHO LOST THEIR LIVES [inaudible] FROM CRIMINALS. DO MAKE ARGUMENTS WHY THEY SHOULD NOT BE SUPPORTED. I STRONGLY URGE YOUR AYE VOTE ON THIS MEASURE. I SURE LEVINE YOUR READINESS. YEAH VERY MUCH MISTER SPEAKER I STAND IN SUPPORT OF THIS RESOLUTION I WHEN I HEARD ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES ON THE FLOOR TALKING ABOUT. THE TRADERS -- THAT TO HE WANTED TO STAND UP AND SUPPORT HAVING THE STATUES FOR I KIND OF SHOUTED OUT A COUPLE OF THE CONCERNS THAT I HAD BUT I DIDN'T THINK I WANTED TO GET UP AND SPEAK BUT I JUST CANNOT BELIEVE THAT A TIME AND AGAIN MORE OF YOU KEEP. STANDING UP. TO STAND UP FOR THESE PEOPLE WHO WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DEATHS OF MORE AMERICANS IN WAR THAN ANYWHERE ELSE ANY OTHER TIME. EVER HAPPENED IN THIS COUNTRY THAT THERE PEOPLE STANDING UP FOR THESE CONFEDERATE LEADERS THAT WERE TRAITORS TO OUR COUNTRY. HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF AMERICANS DIED FIGHTING FOR COUNTRY IF YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT. KNOWING OUR HISTORY. AND PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY DO CELEBRATE HISTORY IN EVEN THE BAD HISTORY IF YOU GO TO PLACES LIKE BERLIN YOU SEE WHERE THEY BURNED THE BOOKS THEY DON'T HAVE A STATUE OF HITLER. YOU SEE WHERE THESE ATROCITIES OCCURRED THEY DON'T CELEBRATE THEIR NAMES. SO IF WE WANT TO PUT THESE CONFEDERATE LEADERS [inaudible] I IT IN IN UNDERSTAND THEIR HISTORY THEN WE SHOULD UNDERSTAND THAT HISTORY RATHER THAN CELEBRATING THEIR THEIR MEMORY. AND I I WOULD JUST YOU KNOW THE FACT THAT THERE ARE STILL MIKES UP THAT ONE TO STAND IN SUPPORT. OF THESE NAMES OF THESE LEADERS OF HAVING THE STATUES BE UP TO HAVE SCHOOLS THAT STUDENTS WALK IN TO BE NAMED AFTER PEOPLE WHO ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE MURDER OF AMERICANS. AND TO KEEP THE ENSLAVEMENT OF AMERICANS IS JUST BEYOND MY BELIEF [inaudible] THANK YOU. PATTERSON YOUR REGULAR. SPEAKER MEMBERS I'M MY MICROPHONE IS NOT UP. OF FOR THE COMPLAINT OF MY COLLEAGUE HERE MY MIKE IS UP. TO JUST ASK IN THE CONTEXT OF THIS DISCUSSION NOT WITHSTANDING YOUR VOTE ON THIS. OUR I HAPPEN TO BE -- DEEPLY INVOLVED AND INTERESTED AND AMERICAN HISTORY AND HAVE FOR MY ENTIRE LIFE. I KNOW THIS IS COMPLICATED I KNOW THIS IS STRESSING MEMBERS HERE. I JUST HAVE A SUGGESTION. KEN BURNS HAS CREATED A REMARKABLE FILM. ON THE CIVIL WAR FOR PBS. IT IS THOROUGH AND COMPLETE AND VERY VERY FAIR. AND IT DOES PRESENT THE COMPLEXITIES. OF ALL OF THIS ARE AND ALSO OF THE AFTERMATH IN A LIKE. SO I'M NOT SUGGESTING THAT YOU VOTE ONE WAY OR THE OTHER THIS IS A DISCUSSION THAT. PROBABLY ISN'T GOING TO AND THAT IT IS GOING TO BE A POLITICAL MATTER. BUT JUST AS A POINT OF INFORMATION AND IT IS A POINT OF A FIRST CLASS BIT OF HISTORY -- GET A COPY OWN IT I VIEW IT MORE THAN ONCE. AND YOU WILL GET A SENSE. I'LL BE COMPLEXITY THAT'S AT STAKE IT MAY STRENGTHEN YOUR RESOLVE IN THIS ONE WAY OR THE OTHER IT MAY. WE CAN IT BUT AT THE VERY LEAST. YOU WILL HAVE ACCESS. REALLY REALLY GOOD [inaudible] IN A UNBIASED. THOROUGH AND COMPLETE HISTORY. THAT IS A REMARKABLE PIECE OF WORK THAT HELPS US TO UNDERSTAND WHAT TRANSPIRED -- I THINK THE REMARKABLE THING IN ALL OF BUT KEN BURNS DID WAS TO ABLE TO MAKE THIS IS COMPLEXES. THAT IT AND AND AND AND UNDERSTANDABLE BUT THERE IS A OF WELL KNOWN A HISTORIAN AND IT -- WHO SAYS BASICALLY THAT THE CIVIL WAR TURNED THE UNITED STATES? FROM OUR TO INDIA'S. THE PRIDE OF THE CIVIL WAR WAS PERFECTLY [inaudible] A GRAMMATICALLY CORRECT. TO CALL THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA ARE. PLURAL TODAY WE SAY THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. IS AND ALL THROUGH THE PAINT OFF TO THE BLOODSHED IN ALL THROUGH THE CIVIL WAR THERE HAS BEEN AN ARC IN THEIR OF HISTORY. THAT I THINK WE NEED TO BE CELEBRATING AN UNDERSTANDING. DEEPLY -- FOR IT ALSO. MISTER BURNS MAKES THEIR CAKE CASE IN THE FILM. THAT YOU CANNOT UNDERSTAND. AMERICAN THE TWENTIETH AND TWENTY FIRST CENTURY UNLESS YOU UNDERSTOOD. AMERICA IN THE MIDDLE A OF THE EIGHTEEN HUNDREDS. AND I'M NOT MAKING A CASE ONE WAY OR ANOTHER HERE. WHAT I AM SUGGESTING IS THERE ARE THERE IS A GREAT PIECE OF HISTORY? THAT WILL HELP UNDERSTAND YOU TO UNDERSTAND. A LOT OF THE COMPLEXITIES HERE BOTH ON THE NORTHERN AND THE AND THE SOUTHERN SIDE. OUR ON I THINK IT WOULD BE VERY VERY HELPFUL. INSTEAD OF I THINK OF MAKING PROCLAMATIONS ABOUT YOUR POINT OF VIEW OVER. OVER HISTORICAL SITUATIONS AND EVENTS AT LEAST BIG AND DEEPLY TO THAT KEN BURNS SERIES. I OWN THE ACTUALLY THE I PRINTED WORK AS A RESULT IT IS A GREAT REFERENCE AND I THINK THAT IT WOULD BE VERY VERY HELPFUL. AND QUITE INSPIRATIONAL FRANKLY EVEN IN THE MIDST OF DOCUMENTING THE HORROR OF THAT ERA THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER PATTERSON MS MELENDEZ YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND LADIES AND GENTLEMEN I WAS A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED WHEN OUR COLLEAGUE FROM SAN RAFAEL SAW THREE REPUBLICAN MICROPHONES UP. AND STOOD UP AND SAID THAT HE WAS APPALLED THAT -- PEOPLE ARE STILL RAISING THEIR MICROPHONES TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF OR IN OPPOSITION. TO THIS REVOLUTION IN SUPPORT OF THE PEOPLE. WHO ARE MEMORIALIZED IN STATE -- I'M NOT STANDING UP TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF MEMORIALIZING THESE FOLKS IN FACT I'M I'M SUPPORTING THIS RESOLUTION AND I THINK. THE COMMENT FROM MY FRIEND FROM SOUTH SAN RAFAEL ILLUSTRATES THAT WE NEED TO HAVE. MORE OF A CONVERSATION ABOUT -- OUR FEELINGS ABOUT THE ISSUE AND I THINK IT'S I MEAN THAT'S IMPORTANT TO ME THAT WE HAVE AN UNDERSTANDING IN THAT EVERYONE IN HERE GETS THAT WE ARE UNITED IN -- WANTING TO WORK FOR A BETTER SOCIETY IN TREATING ONE ANOTHER BETTER SO IT'S GOING TO CERTAINLY GOING TO BE MY PLEDGE TO MAKE SURE THAT. WE FOR THAT CONVERSATION BUT WITH RESPECT TO THE RESOLUTION. I DON'T THINK IT'S SEEKS TO ERASE HISTORY ON I THINK IF SOMEONE WERE SAYING GET RID OF EVERY STATUE EVERY MONUMENT EVERY NAME EVERY PLAQUE. AND PUT IT IN THE DUMPSTER THAT CERTAINLY IS AN EFFORT TO ERASE HISTORY I THINK PUTTING IN ANY MUSEUM MAKES SENSE -- YOU CAN. PUT IT IN A CONTEXT WHERE THERE SOME EXPLANATION INTO BACKGROUND BEHIND WHO THESE FIGURES REALLY WERE WHAT THEY DID WHAT THEY STOOD FOR THEIR RIGHTFUL PLACE IN HISTORY FOR THAT -- THAT'S DIFFICULT TO DO WHEN IT'S A STATUE THAT JUST HAS A PLAQUE ON IT PROBABLY DOESN'T EXPLAIN. EVERYTHING IN THAT PERSON'S HISTORY AND AND WHAT THEIR RESPONSIBLE FOREST I SUPPORT. THE MOVE TO PUT THEM IN MUSEUMS THAT HAVE A ALLOW PEOPLE HAVE A DEEPER CONVERSATION RELEASED UNDERSTANDING ABOUT WHAT THEY DID IN CERTAINLY THE KEN BURNS DOCUMENTARIES WONDERFUL. NAM AS WELL AND HOPEFULLY WILL CONTINUE THIS CONVERSATION. IN OUR SCHOOLS TO THAT OUR KIDS GET THAT YOUNG PEOPLE ARE COMPLICATED AND THAT WAS A DIFFERENT TIME IN OUR HISTORY THAT DOESN'T MAKE WHAT HAPPENED RIGHT -- BUT YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND IT IF NOTHING ELSE SO I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE RESOLUTION THANK YOU. MISTER CHAVEZ YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. I THINK I'D LIKE TO TAKE THIS BACK TO THE SDA ARE ACTUALLY WHAT WE'RE GOING TO BE VOTING ON HERE. AND WHAT IT SAYS IS WE'RE GOING TO READING. RECOMMENDED RENAME ANY FEDERAL BUILDING PARKS ROADWAYS. AND HIGHWAY MARKERS AND IT GOES ON SO WE'RE ACTUALLY QUESTION TO RENAME THE ADULT CONTEXT TO IT SOMEBODY MADE THE COMMENT. Y. WE RECOGNIZE PEOPLE THAT MURDERED AMERICANS. THAT COMMENT MADE ON THE FLOOR SHOWS. AND THAT THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS GOING ON AT THE TIME. THESE WEREN'T MURDERED AMERICANS THESE ARE FATHERS FIGHTING SON. BROTHERS FIGHTING OTHER BROTHERS. A CIVIL WAR TOWARD THIS COUNTRY APART. YOU KNOW MAYBE BECAUSE I'VE LIVED IN VIRGINIA AND BEEN BACK THERE FACT THOSE ARE JUST A FEW WEEKS AGO. AND BOX SOME BATTLEFIELDS MANASSAS BECAUSE MY DAUGHTER LIVES THERE. AND I TOOK THE TIME TO GO TO ARLINGTON CEMETERY. I WAS THINKING ABOUT AS I WAS WALKING AROUND. WHAT I WAS SEEN? HARLEY DID CEMETERY PROBABLY ONE OF THE MOST HOLLOWED GROUNDS IN OUR COUNTRY RECOGNIZING THOSE WHO HAVE SERVED. RIGHT IN THE CENTER OF IT. IS LEE HOUSE. ROBERT E. LEE [inaudible] HOUSE. IT'S WHERE HE WAS WHEN HE DECIDED TO GIVE UP HIS COMMISSION. AS A UNION AS A FEDERAL SO GENERAL. TO LEAD VIRGINIA. AND TODAY IF YOU GO THERE HAS HOUSE OF STILL THERE. YOU CAN WALK AND SEE HIS BEDROOM AND THE FURNITURE AND PICTURES OF HIS FAMILY. ARE WE SAYING THAT WE WANT TO RENAME LEE HOUSE. TO PUT IT IN THE MUSEUM. YOU WALK THE BATTLEFIELDS OF MANASSAS AROUND THE AREA. THERE'S ONE BATTLEFIELD THAT I WAS WALKING THROUGH ITS GOES TO A FORCED. I AM NOT TO THE SIDE OF THE FORCE. THEY SAY THERE'S SCIENCES LARGEST CEMETERY. AND WHEN YOU GO INTO THE CEMETERY. YOU SEE THESE DEPICTION OF HOW THE CONFEDERATE SOLDIERS WHO LIVE IN THESE THINGS THEY CALLED THE DOG HOUSES WHICH WERE MUCH BIGGER IN THESE. TWO DESPERATE TOGETHER AND SIX MEN WERE LIVING THERE. AND THAT'S WHERE THEY WERE IN THE WINTERTIME AND THEY ALL GOT SICK AND MANY OF THEM DIED THERE. BUT IF YOU LOOK AT IT. THE DOT OF THE CONFEDERACY FROM SOUTH CAROLINA. HAD MARK DID AS A GRAVE SITE BECAUSE THIS IS WHERE. ONE OF THEIR BATTALIONS WERE SET. AND THE YOUNG MAN DIED THERE. THAT'S IN VIRGINIA. I WE SAYING THAT WE SHOULD TAKE THAT MARKER CEMETERY TO SOUTH CAROLINA PUT IN THERE. FOR THEIR YOUNG PEOPLE AND MOVE THAT OUT. YOU KNOW WHERE IN CALIFORNIA WE DIDN'T YOU KNOW. WE CAN GET SEE THE* FACE ARE IN VIRGINIA NORTH CAROLINA SOUTH CAROLINA. I FIND IT INTERESTING THAT THE PEOPLE IN VIRGINIA AND SOUTH CAROLINA HAVE LEARNED HOW. TO DEAL WITH THIS. IN THE VARIOUS RESPECTFUL WAY THAT THESE ARE TERRIBLE TIMES I'M NOT SUPPORTED SLAVERY SLAVERY WOULD IN MY OPINION WAS A SENATE THE BIRTH OF PRICE. IT WAS A SEN IN THE UNITED STATES. AND NOW AS WE KNOW TODAY. THERE ARE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE IN SLAVERY TODAY. I'M NOT SUPPORTING SLAVERY. WHAT I AM SAYING IS? I'M SUPPORTING WHAT MADE THIS COUNTRY GREAT. AND WE MAY NOT LIKE IT. BUT THE CIVIL WAR ALLOWED US TO UNDERSTAND THE FIND THE ISSUE OF STATE'S RIGHTS. THAT WE ACTUALLY ARE A COUNTRY. THERE WE CAN COME TOGETHER ON THE BELIEF THAT WE ARE ONE PEOPLE. AND THAT THAT WAS MORE IMPORTANT AND THE DIVISION OF THE STATE'S THANK BACK OF A PART OF THIS HAPPEN. WE WEREN'T EVEN A COUNTRY A HUNDRED YEARS THE IDEA THAT STE STATES COULD COME TOGETHER AND BE A UNION. THAT'S WHAT WAS GOING ON HERE. AND PEOPLE DIED ON BOTH SIDES FOR THIS. FOR US TO PUT AN SJR TO SAY THAT THOSE SOUTH CAROLINA MEN. WHO DIED IN THIS WAR SHOULD BE REMOVED BECAUSE WE IN CALIFORNIA THINK IT SHOULDN'T BE THERE? OR THAT GENERAL LEE'S HOUSE SHOULD BE REMOVED BECAUSE SHE WAS A LEADER OF THE CONFEDERATE FORCES THIRTY SECONDS MR DENIES RESPONSIBILITY OF WHAT MADE THIS COUNTRY GREAT. AND WHAT'S GOING ON THAT DAY AND HOW COUNTRIES AND OF SOUTH. TO OUT EAST COAST ACTUALLY DEALT WITH THIS. THIS IS A IS A WRONG HEADED MOVEMENT WITH THIS [inaudible] BUT TAKES HISTORY. M. MINIMIZES IT [inaudible] ARGENEAU. GABRIEL HERE RECOGNIZE. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS RESOLUTION FRANKLY I I HAVE TO ADMIT I'M A LITTLE BIT SURPRISED THAT THERE'S DEBATE ON THIS RESOLUTION. AND I WAS REMINDED US FOLKS WERE SPEAKING ABOUT AN EXCELLENT SPEECH THAT -- MITCHELL ENTER THE FORMER MAYOR OF NEW ORLEANS GAVE. ON THE OCCASION OF THE DECISION BY HIS CD TO REMOVE FOR CONFEDERATE MONUMENTS AND I THINK IT PROVIDES AN IMPORTANT CONTEXT OF THIS DEBATE AND MISTER SPEAKER WITH YOUR PERMISSION. I'D LIKE TO READ SOME VERY SHORT ACT SEARCH IN THAT SPEECH WITHOUT OBJECTION. SO LET'S START WITH THE FACTS THE HISTORIC RECORD IS CLEAR. THE ROBERT E. LEE JEFFERSON DAVIS AND P. G. T. BEAUREGARD STATUTES WE'RE NOT ATTRACTED JUST TO HONOR THESE MEN. BUT AS PART OF THE MOVEMENT WHICH BECAME KNOWN AS THE CULT OF THE LOST CAUSE. THIS COLT HAD ONE GOAL. THROUGH MONUMENTS IN THROUGH OTHER MEANS TO REWRITE HISTORY TO HIDE THE TRUTH. IS THAT THE CONFEDERACY WAS ON THE WRONG SIDE OF HUMANITY. THE STATUTES ARE NOT JUST STONE AND METAL. THEY ARE NOT JUST INNOCENT REMEMBRANCES OF A BENIGN HISTORY. THESE MONUMENTS PURPOSEFULLY CELEBRATE A FICTIONAL SANITIZE CONSIDERED CITY. IGNORING THE DEATH IGNORING THE ENSLAVEMENT AND THE TERROR THAT IT ACTUALLY STOOD. FOR AFTER THE CIVIL WAR THE STATUTES WERE PART OF IT THAT TERRORISM AS MUCH AS BURNING A CROSS ON SOMEONE'S LAWN. THEY WERE ERECTED PURPOSELY TO SEND A STRONG MESSAGE TO ALL WHO WALKED IN THEIR SHADOW. ABOUT WHO IS STILL IN CHARGE OF THE CITY. SHOULD YOU HAVE FURTHER DOUBT ABOUT THE TRUE GOALS OF THE CONFEDERACY IN THE VERY WEEKS BEFORE THE WAR BROKE OUT. THE VICE PRESIDENT THE CONFEDERACY ALEXANDER STEPHENS MADE IT CLEAR THAT THE CONFEDERATE CAUSE WAS ABOUT MAINTAINING SLAVERY AND WHITE SUPREMACY. HE SAID IN HIS NOW FAMOUS CORNERSTONE SPEECH THAT THE CONFEDERACY CORNERSTONE RESTS UPON THE GREAT TRUTH. THAT THE NEGRO IS NOT EQUAL TO THE WHITE MAN. THAT SLAVERY SUBORDINATION TO THE SUPERIOR RACE IS HIS NATURAL AND NORMAL CONDITION. THIS OUR NEW GOVERNMENT IS THE FIRST IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD. BASED UPON THIS GREAT PHYSICAL PHILOSOPHICAL AND MORAL TRUTH. IT'S I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT WE UNDERSTAND THAT CONTACT THAT WE UNDERSTAND THE CULT OF THE LOST CAUSE AND THE REASON THAT FOLKS MADE AN EFFORT. TO NAME OUR SCHOOLS AND OUR BRIDGES AND OUR ROADS AFTER FOLKS FROM THE CONFEDERACY INTO A WRECK THESE MONUMENTS IT'S I HOPE FOLKS WILL KEEP IN MIND THATCONTEXT. WHEN THEY THINK ABOUT HOW TO VOTE ON THIS RED DELUDE RESOLUTION? AND I'D REALLY RESPECTFULLY URGE MY COLLEAGUES WHO'VE WHO'VE EXPRESSED OPPOSITION TO THIS RESOLUTION. THINK ABOUT THE SYMBOLIC POWER HERE. AND THE POWER OF THIS RESOLUTION IN THE MESSAGE THAT IT SENDS TO FOLKS. WHO ARE HISTORIC VICTIMS OF THE CONFEDERACY AND OF THE OUR COUNTRY'S LEGACY OF RACIAL OPPRESSION AND ESPECIALLY IN LIGHT OF WHAT'S GOING ON IN OUR COUNTRY RIGHT NOW? I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. HERE'S GABRIEL SEEING NO ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION. ON THE RESOLUTION. MISS GONZALEZ FLETCHER YOU MAY CLOSE THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER. YOU KNOW A FEW OF YOU ON THE FLOOR OF COUNTRY CAN IN SAID CAN YOU BELIEVE WE'RE HAVING THIS DISCUSSION BUT UNFORTUNATELY I CAN'T BECAUSE THE REASON I'M SO PASSIONATE ABOUT THIS ISSUE. IS IT WAS AN ISSUE WE TOOK UP IN MY DISTRICT. RIGHT AFTER I GOT ELECTED WITH ME REALIZE THAT WHAT WE ALWAYS CALLED THE ELEMENTARY WAS ACTUALLY ROBERT E. LEE ELEMENTARY. A SCHOOL THAT HAD BEEN ESTABLISHED IN THE LATE FIFTIES A SCHOOL THAT NOW HAS 97% PEOPLE OF COLOR. AND WHEN WE WORKED TO CHANGE THE NAME OF THAT SCHOOL. A LOT OF WHAT WAS BEING SAID HERE ON THE FLOOR. WAS SAID TO ME. BY FOLKS WHO DON'T EVEN LIVE IN THE COMMUNITY [inaudible] COMPLEX. THERE'S A LONG HISTORY LET'S NOT GET RID OF OUR HISTORY BUT LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS. MOST SCHOOLS IN A NUMBER OF THESE THESE ARE TRIBUTES. WE'RE PLEASED UP IN THE FIFTIES AND SIXTIES AS A WAY TO THREATEN AFRICAN AMERICAN [inaudible] FOLKS [inaudible] A REMINDER. A REMINDER OF WHO WAS IN CHARGE A REWRITING OF HISTORY. SANITIZING OF THE CONFEDERACY THAT'S NOT. GIVING OURSELVES SOME HISTORICAL CONTEXT. THAT'S TRYING TO REESTABLISH. WHAT SOME PEOPLE STILL ARE TRYING TO JUSTIFY? I ALMOST WALKED AWAY FROM THE FIGHT OF RENAMING THE SCHOOL MY DISTRICT BECAUSE IT WAS TAKING UP SO MUCH TIME AND ENERGY. IT WAS BECAUSE MY DAUGHTER. WHO IMPLORED ME EMPLOYED WITH GOING. MY DAUGHTER IS HALF BLACK. PER FAMILY COMES FROM ALABAMA. AND SHE REMINDED ME THAT S.. DON'T EVER LET SOMEBODY SAY. OUR HISTORY IS COMPLEX. PEOPLE WHO FOUGHT FOR THE CONFEDERACY. THE PEOPLE WHO ENSLAVED MY DAUGHTERS ANCESTORS WHO RAPED THEM AND KILLED THEM. WHO SOLD THEM AND OWNS ABOUT? IT'S NOT COMPLEX. THERE WERE NO BUT NOT MINE SLAVEOWNERS. IF WE WANT TO BE SERIOUS ABOUT OUR HISTORY. AND WATCHING KEN BURNS DOCUMENTARIES WE HAVE TO BE SERIOUS ABOUT THE FACT THAT WE HAVE ALL UNFORTUNATELY. BEEN PRODUCTS OF AN EDUCATION SYSTEM THAT TELLS US THIS HISTORY IS JUST. OKAY THERE WERE GOOD PEOPLE ROBERT REALLY WASN'T THAT BAD. HE WAS COMPLEX NO HE WAS FIGHTING TO HAVE A WHOLE. BUNCH OF FOLKS CONTINUE TO BE IN AN INSTITUTION. WHERE THEY WERE ABLE TO BE RAPED SOLD MURDERED? AND OWNED. I'M SORRY I FIND NOTHING COMPLEX ABOUT SAYING THAT'S WRONG. IN THAT WE SHOULD NEVER HONOR FOLKS. WHO ALLOW THAT TO GO FOR IT? IN THAT OUR HISTORY SHOULD BE HONEST IN OUR HISTORY BOOKS. THERE WERE NO BUT NINE SLAVEHOLDERS THERE WERE NO BUT NINE CONFEDERATE SOLDIERS. IN THERE SURE AS HELL WERE NO HEROES IN THE CONFEDERACY. FIGHTING IS TRADERS AGAINST OUR COUNTRY. IN FIGHTING TO CONTINUE TO OWN MIGHT DAUGHTERS ANCESTOR. I'M SORRY THIS WHOLE DISCUSSION ALTHOUGH IT MIGHT MEAN. IT'S KIND OF SICKENING. AND I THINK IT IS TIME. THAT WE DON'T TALK ABOUT THIS KNOW WHAT WHAT ABOUT IS A WAY. WHAT WHAT ARE WE GOING DOWN WHAT ROAD ARE WE GOING DOWN BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT WE SHOULD GO DOWN THAT ROAD? WE SHOULD TALK ABOUT OUR INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE NAMED AFTER SLAVEHOLDERS NATIVE AMERICANS AND WE SHOULD TALK ABOUT OUR INSTITUTIONS AND OUR FORMER PRESIDENTS THAT DID THINGS THAT WERE REALLY BAD IN ATROCIOUS. AND QUIT ACTING. LIKE THEY'RE HEROIC BECAUSE THEY WERE IN A DIFFERENT TIME PERIOD WELL HUMAN. IN THE WERE PLENTY OF PEOPLE IN THAT TIME PERIOD WHO KNEW SLAVERY WAS FROM. IN THE WHERE PLENTY OF PEOPLE WHO KNEW WE ARE ALL HUMAN BEINGS AND SHOULD BE TREATED THAT WAY. LET'S NOT FORGET THAT HISTORY SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE ON THIS RESOLUTION. M.

THANK YOU MEMBERS THIS IS AB EIGHTEEN EIGHTY FOR WHICH IS BACK FROM THE SENATE ON CONCURRENCE THIS IS MUCH DRAWS UPON REQUEST BILL MY COLLEAGUES FROM HUNTINGTON BEACH FAVORITE BILL LEFT AUTHORED THIS YEAR -- ONE BE REALLY CLEAR ABOUT A COUPLE POINTS THIS IS. FOR DINING RESTAURANTS ONLY WHERE YOU GO AND THERE'S A SERVER THAT'S IN YOU -- YOUR FOOD IN YOUR STRAW -- IT'S I REQUEST IF NOT A BAN. AND THIS IS TO HELP RAISE AWARENESS ABOUT THE ISSUE THE POSSE POLLUTION HAVING THAT REDUCTION OF SINGLE USE PLASTIC STRAWS. IN OUR RESTAURANTS IS A GOOD THING -- AND YOU KNOW THIS IS A LITTLE THIS IS A SMALL STEP THAT IS IN A BAND THAT CAN HELP US CURVE THE ISSUE OF OF SINGLE USE CLASSICS IN OUR ENVIRONMENT. THE GETTING IN OUR OCEAN OUR WATERWAYS AND OUR LANDFILLS THESE ARE NOT EASILY RECYCLABLE MATERIALS SO THIS IS AN IMPORTANT FIRST STEP -- I REALLY WANT TO THINK -- THERE FROM SANTA MONICA FOR THE WORK THAT HE'S DONE ON THIS ISSUE IT'S A BIG DEAL IT'S IT'S GETTING A LOT OF ATTENTION I THINK IT DOES A LOT OF GOOD AND I THINK IT'S THE RIGHT FIRST STEP. IN THE RIGHT BALANCE WHEN IT COMES TO HELPING US -- TRY TO TACKLE THE ISSUE OF SINGLE USE PLASTICS IN OUR ENVIRONMENT I THINK YOU AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE NOW. THANK YOU MISTER CALDERON MS MELENDEZ THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER -- SO. I THINK EVERYONE IN HERE AGREES THAT WE'D ALL LIKE TO REDUCE WASTE IN OUR WATERWAYS INNER OCEANS THERE'S NOTHING WORSE THAN GOING TO THE BEACH AND SEEING PEOPLE LEAVE THEIR TRASH BEHIND AND IT'S JUST. IF IT'S NOT A GOOD THING PARTICULARLY BEAUTIFUL COASTLINE OF CALIFORNIA SO WITH THAT. WHERE WORDS WERE TOGETHER WERE AYE AYE ON THAT OKAY HOWEVER -- YA BEEN LARGELY SILENT ON THIS STRAW THING BUT I HAVE TO SAY THAT I'M WONDERING WHY WE HAVE A BILL AND I KNOW BABY STEPS BY. IT IT ONLY APPLIES TO SIT DOWN RESTAURANTS NOT. TAKE OUT RESTAURANT IT'S WHICH WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT. WHEN YEAR TO SIT DOWN RESTAURANT YOU'RE NOT WHEN YOU LEAVE THE RESTAURANT YOU'RE NOT TAKING YOUR STRAW WITH YOU? WHEN YOU'RE LEAVING A TAKE OUT RESTAURANT YOU ARMY THAT'S LARGELY YOU KNOW WHERE YOU GETTING THEIR STAR SO I JUST DON'T SEE HOW THIS IS GOING TO MAKE? THAT MUCH OF A DIFFERENCE. AND REDUCING THE AMOUNT OF STRIDES IN THE WATERWAYS -- I'M SURE THE AUTHOR PROBABLY TRIED. TO TIE IN FAST FOOD RESTAURANTS IN THERE BUT PERHAPS CUTS IN PUSH BACK ON THAT THANK YOU -- BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY. PUNISHING THE RESTAURANT -- FOR DEFYING THIS MANDATE I JUST THINK SENDS THE WRONG MESSAGE OF BIG EDUCATION CAMPAIGN MAKES SENSE FOR SURE AND I THINK -- AN INCENTIVE BASED PROGRAM MAKES EVEN MORE SENSE BUT THIS TYPE OF PROGRAM WHERE THEY'RE BEING PUNISHED WITH JUST IT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE THE RIGHT FIT SO I WOULD ENCOURAGE A NO VOTE. MR MATHIS YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE AUTHOR THE BILL BUT WHEN I I TAKE MY WIFE OUT TO EAT AND WE SIT DOWN AND FINALLY HAVE A CHANCE TO GET AWAY FROM THE KIDS I'M NOT LOOKING FOR A LECTURE ON STRAWS IN OCEAN HEALTH BY IN. AN INTERRUPTION OF THE AMBIANCE -- LET US LOOK AT EDUCATION FOR QUEEN OF THE OCEANS AND STOP LET'S NOT DO IT WHEN WE FINALLY GET A LITTLE PEACE AWAY FROM THE KIDS. A LOS ANGELES MILLS WITH OUR LOVED ONES AND SET AGAIN LECTURES ASK FOR NO VOTE SURE HARPER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ARE MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS. JUST WANTED TOUCH ON ONE POINT THAT I THINK THAT WAS ACKNOWLEDGED OF PREVIOUSLY DURING THE FLOOR DEBATE. IN THIS IS A PRIME EXAMPLE OF INCREMENTALISM I THINK THAT WAS UP BROUGHT UP. A BY THE MEMBER FOR RIVERSIDE COUNTY. THAT THIS IS JUST THE FIRST STEP. TOWARDS A COMPLETE BAN. IF REPREHENSIBLE PENALTIES TOWARD SMALL ABOUT BUSINESS. AND THAT ENTRY IS AN INTRODUCED IN THE US SUBSEQUENT LEGISLATIVE CYCLE. IT WILL BE INTRODUCED VERY SOON. BECAUSE ALL THIS IS IS JUST INCREMENTALISM TOWARDS NANNY STATE GOVERNMENT CONTROL I ASK FOR YOUR NO VOTE. SAYING NO ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION DEBATE ON THE ITEM MISTER CALDERON YOU MAY CLOSE I APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS FROM MY COLLEAGUES THIS BILL LITERALLY HAS NO OPPOSITION THE RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION. DOES NOT OPPOSE THIS BILL THEY DON'T SEE THESE FINES EYES BEING REPREHENSIBLE WOULD WANT TO TALK ABOUT THAT. V. REPREHENSIBLE ASPECT OF THIS BILL IT'S TWO WARNINGS AND THEN A TWENTY FIVE DOLLAR FINE CAPPED AT THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS I IT'S JUST IT'S REASONABLE IT'S A REASONABLE STEP THAT'S WHY THE REST ONE ASSOCIATION IS NOT IN OPPOSITION OF THIS BILL. THAT'S WHY THE PLASTICS INDUSTRY ARE THE ONES MAKING THE STRAWS ARE NOT IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL AND IT'S ALSO IF THERE'S GOT TO BE A RECOGNITION THAT AS WE STE. AS WE CHANGE AND WE WE EVOLVE IN OUR THINKING ABOUT OUR CONVENIENCES VERSE IS WHAT'S ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY -- THAT WE TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THE POTENTIAL IMPACT SECOND HAVE THAT CAN HAPPEN WHEN WE MAKE THESE CHANGES AND SO BY DOING AN INCREMENTAL STEP THAT'S THE RIGHT WAY TO DO IT. BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHERE WE ARE SIGNALING TO THE INDUSTRY TO THE MANUFACTURERS THAT THIS IS WHERE OUR COMMUNITIES ARE TODAY THIS IS WHAT THE STATE IS TODAY IT GIVES THEM THE OPPORTUNITY AND THE TIME. TO FIND A DIFFERENT SOLUTION. ALLOW FOR IT. TO AND I THINK THAT THAT'S HOW WE SHOULD DO IT AND YOU KNOW WHAT THE BEST CASE SCENARIO IS THEY JUST ARE TO MAKE THESE DECISIONS ON THEIR OWN. JUST LIKE STARBUCKS MADE THE DECISION ON THEIR OWN THAT'S JUST LIKE MCDONALDS IN THE UK DID IT ON THEIR OWN AND THEY'RE GONNA BE LOOKING AT DOING THAT AND IN THE UNITED STATES. JUST LIKE THE EUROPEAN UNION -- YOU KNOW THEY'RE NOW LOOKING AT THIS SO OUT A LOT OF SMALL RESTAURANTS THEY TALK TO ME THE LIKE I LIKE THIS BILL BECAUSE IT GIVES ME THE OPTION IT'S KINDA HONESTLY GOING TO SAVE ME ON COST BECAUSE WHEN I PUT THAT STRAW DOWN THE TABLE EVEN IF IT'S WRAPPED. UP I STILL THROWN AWAY FOR HEALTH PURPOSES SO THIS IS SMART THIS IS COMMON SENSE IT'S IT'S NOT OVER BURDEN SOME IN TERMS OF WHAT WE'RE ASKING FOR AT IN ORDER JUST.

IN APRIL OF TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN BIGGIE WAS MURDERED. TODAY MY AUTHORS AND I JOIN ANA. IN ASKING YOU. TO REMEMBER PEAKY. NOT ONLY AND HOW HE LIVED. BUT ON HOW HE DIED. BECAUSE FELLOW MEMBERS THE PERSON WHO COMMITTED THIS HEINOUS ACT. WAS SPEAKING FATHER FATHER. YES HIS OWN FATHER. DURING A LONG CUSTODIAL DISPUTE. AFTER A DIVORCED TO DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. THE FAMILY COURT SYSTEM REPEATEDLY REFUSED TO GIVE ANA SOLE CUSTODY [inaudible] DESPITE MOUNTING EVIDENCE THAT PEAKY WAS IN DANGER. I KNOW FOUGHT FOR HER SON. BUT THE DOCUMENTED ABUSE WAS IGNORED. AND THEN DISMISSED. THE SYSTEM FAILED THIS CHILD. AND FRANKLY WE FAILED THIS CHILD. AND HE'S NOT THE ONLY. ONE SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT AT LEAST SIX HUNDRED AND THIRTY EIGHT CHILDREN IN THE U. S.. HAVE BEEN MURDERED. BY A PARENT IN SIMILAR CIRCUMSTANCES. ACCORDING TO THE CENTER FOR JUDICIAL EXCELLENCE. ABUSIVE PARENTS ARE OFTEN GRANTED CUSTODY. OR I'M PROTECTING UNPROTECTED PARENTING BY FAMILY COURTS. AND MANY CORD RELATED CHILD MURDERS OCCURRED AFTER FAMILY CHORDS GRANTED DANGEROUS PARENTS ACCESS TO CHILDREN. OVER THE OBJECTIONS OF A PROTECTIVE PARENT. EVEN OF CHILDREN SURVIVE A CHILDHOOD FILLED WITH DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. WHETHER THEY ARE THE ONES PHYSICALLY ABUSED OR NOT. THEY CAN HAVE LONG LIFELONG PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS. THIS INCLUDES ANXIETY. AND DEPRESSION. DIFFICULT IN RELATIONSHIPS ACADEMIC EMPLOYMENT FAILURES AND TROUBLE WITH THEIR OWN PARENTING. THERE ARE ALSO MORE LIKELY TO USE VIOLENCE THEMSELVES. WITHOUT INTERVENTION AT AN EARLY AGE THE CYCLE OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE WILL CONTINUE TODAY.

THIS BILL WILL ALLOW PARENT OR GUARDIAN TO COME ON CAMPUS TO ADMINISTER MEDICAL CANNABIS TO THEIR CHILD IN A NON SMOKING AND NON IN NON VAPING FORMS. MANY OF THE STUDENTS NEED TO TAKE A DOSE OF MEDICAL CANNABIS AT REGULAR INTERVALS WHICH OFTEN INCLUDES DURING SCHOOL HOURS CURRENT LAW DOES NOT ALLOW ANY FORM OF CANNABIS ON SCHOOL GROUNDS. THE STUDENTS MUST BE PICKED UP BY THE PARENTS AND TAKING OFF CAMPUS IN ORDER TO TAKE THEIR MEDICINE IS A VERY DISRUPTIVE TO THEIR LEARNING. SP ELEVEN TWENTY SEVEN WILL ALLOW THE GOVERNING BOARD OF THE K. TWELVE SCHOOL DISTRICT COUNTY BOARD OF EDUCATION OR CHARTER SCHOOL. CHOOSE WHETHER TO ADOPT THIS POLICY IS NOT A STATE MANDATE.

MEMBERS WE ARE MOVING TO ITEM ONE EIGHTY NINE SP SEVEN FIFTY NINE MADAM CLERK PLEASE READ. SENATE BILL SEVEN FIFTY NINE BY SENATOR MCGUIRE AND OTHERS IN ATLANTA ELECTIONS DECLARING THE URGENCY THERE UP TO TAKE EFFECT IMMEDIATELY. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER MULLIN YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER MEMBERS A STRONG DEMOCRACY DEPENDS ON A VOTERS BELIEVE THAT HIS OR HER BALLOT COUNTS HOWEVER IN CALIFORNIA ACCORDING TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE'S OFFICE. OVER TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND BALLOTS WERE THROWN OUT IN THE NOVEMBER GENERAL ELECTION BECAUSE OF A MISMATCHING SIGNATURE THAT WAS NOVEMBER. TWENTY SIXTEEN IN TWENTY FIFTEEN I AUTHORED AB FOR SEVENTY SEVEN WHICH ALLOWS EIGHT DAYS TO CORRECT THE BALLOT WITHOUT A SIGNATURE. HOWEVER THERE ARE STILL NO GUARANTEE THAT A COUNTY GIVES THE VOTER THE OPPORTUNITY TO CORRECT A MISMATCHING SIGNATURE. S. B. SEVEN FIFTY NINE CREATES A PROCESS FOR LOCAL ELECTION OFFICIALS TO NOTIFY VOTERS WHETHER VOTE BY MAIL BALLOTS SIGNATURE MIS MATCHES THE ONE ON FILE. IT ALSO GUARANTEES THOSE VOTERS AN OPPORTUNITY TO CORRECT THE MISMATCH SO THAT THEIR VOTES CAN BE COUNTED. THERE ARE MANY REASONS A BALLOT MAY HAVE A MISMATCH SIGNATURE. IT COULD BE BECAUSE OF OUR AS A DISABILITY. A PERSON SIGNATURE CHANGED OVER TIME SOMEONE MISUNDERSTOOD AND SIGNED IN NON ENGLISH CHARACTERS OR DIFFERENT MEMBER OF THE HOUSEHOLD SUCH AS A SPOUSE OR A CARETAKER. SIGN THE BALLOT. AS THE USE OF VOTE BY MAIL BALLOTS INCREASES IN CALIFORNIA ESPECIALLY AS THE VOTERS CHOICE ACT AS IMPLEMENTED IN MULTIPLE COUNTIES WE CANNOT IGNORE THIS ISSUE ANY LONGER. TODAY OVER HALF OF CALIFORNIANS WILL BY MAIL AND SOME COUNTIES CONDUCTED TIRE ELECTIONS BY MAIL. MEMBERS IT'S UP TO US TO KEEP DEMOCRACY STRONG AND PASS SB SEVEN FIFTY NINE I AS FOR NIGHT THOUGH. THANK YOU SEEN OF I'M SORRY ASSEMBLY MEMBER HARPER YOUR RECOGNIZE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM SPEAKER MEMBERS ELECTION EXPERTS AGREED THAT VOTE BY MAIL BALLOTS ARE THE MOST SUSCEPTIBLE TO FRAUD AND ELECTION. ALLOWING PEOPLE TO TURN IN A COPY OF A VOTER SIGNATURE UP TO TWENTY EIGHT DAYS. NOT SEVEN DAYS TWENTY EIGHT DAYS AFTER AN ELECTION WILL EXACERBATE THE PROBLEM. SINCE A SIGNATURE CAN BE RETURNED TO THE REGISTRAR VIA FAX OR EMAIL THIS WOULD ALLOW ANYONE TO WORK IN VARIOUS WAYS AND EITHER PHOTOSHOP A SIGNATURE. OR COPY THE SIGNATURE FROM SOME OTHER SOURCE EVEN JUST DOWNLOADING IT FROM THE INTERNET. ADDITIONALLY THIS BILL HAS BEEN AMENDED TO BEGIN THE PROCESS. IN THIS YEAR'S ELECTION. NOT THE NEXT SESSION BUT THIS YEAR'S ELECTION. CHANGING THE RULES MID PROCESS LET ME UNDERSCORE. VOTING FOR THIS BILL WOULD CHANGE THE RULES OF MID PROCESS DURING THIS ELECTION. WE WILL NOT HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TEST THAT BEFORE THE OFFICIAL ELECTION AND WITH AN OPPORTUNITY FOR MORE VOTER FRAUD IN THIS YEAR'S ELECTION WITH BALLOT HARVESTING. WE SHOULD WORK TO RESTORE INTEGRITY IN OUR ELECTION SYSTEM NOT DESTROY IT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR NO VOTE ON THIS BILL. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER BERMAN YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER I RISE IN SUPPORT. OF SB. SEVEN FIFTY NINE SEVEN FIFTY NINE ALLOWS A VOTER WHO SIGNATURE ON HIS OR HER VOTE BY MAIL BALLOT. IDENTIFICATION ENVELOPE DOES NOT MATCH THAT SIGNATURE ON FILE IN THE VOTERS RECORD YOUR ATTORNEY COMPLETED SIGNATURE VERIFICATION STATEMENT IN ORDER TO HAVE HIS OR HER BALLOT COUNTED. SIGNATURE ISSUES SUCH AS MISSING SIGNATURES AND MISMATCHING SIGNATURES ARE ONE OF THE TOP REASONS WHY VOTE BY MAIL BALLOTS DO NOT GET COUNTED. WHILE MANY STATESHAVE TAKEN STEPS TO DENY PEOPLE THE RIGHT TO VOTE WERE FORTUNATE THAT CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN A LEADING VOICE TO ENSURE THAT OUR RESIDENTS HAVE THE RIGHT TO VOTE. AND HAVE THEIR VOTE COUNTED NOW WE HEAR A LOT ABOUT ELECTION FRAUD AND OTHERS CAN BE FRAUD IN THIS KIND OF SYSTEM BUT LET'S BE CLEAR WOULD HAVE TO HAPPEN SOMEBODY WHO WANTED TO FRAUDULENTLY INFLUENCE ELECTION. WOULD HAVE TO YOU -- INTER INTERVIEW I INTERVENE CAPTURE COMMUNICATION FROM A REGISTRAR VOTER. TAKE THAT BEFORE IT GETS THE VOTER TELLING THEM THEIR SIGNATURE IS INCORRECT. USE THAT INFORMATION DON'T GET A COPY OF THE PERSON SIGNATURE PDF IT SCANNED IT BACK SEND IT BACK TO THE REGISTER VOTER ALL FOR ONE VOTE. NOW WE HEAR A LOT ABOUT THIS RED HEARING THE VOTER FRAUD BUT WE KNOW THAT THE ONLY PEOPLE TO INFLUENCE ELECTIONS LATELY. I HAVE BEEN FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS LIKE RUSSIA AND VLADIMIR PUTIN AND THEY FOUND WAY SMARTER WAYS INTERFERE ELECTIONS EARNED IT TO INTERVENE IN ELECTIONS THAN THIS DON'T GET DISTRACTED BY RED HEARINGS. WELL THIS IS A GOOD BILL THAT WILL SIMPLY ENSURE THAT ALL VOTERS HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO CURE A MISMATCH SIGNATURE IN ORDER TO HAVE THEIR VOTES COUNTED I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE.
