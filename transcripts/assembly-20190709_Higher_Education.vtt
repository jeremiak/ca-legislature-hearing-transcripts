GOVERNED BY THEIR RULES -- AND

00:33:38.683 --> 00:33:41.853
SO THE BILL ALLOWS FOR THE

COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM -- TO

00:33:44.522 --> 00:33:46.224

RULE CHANGE -- TO IF THIS BILL

00:33:56.934 --> 00:33:58.870
IS SUCCESSFUL TO BE COMPARABLE

00:33:58.936 --> 00:34:00.204
TO THE ROLE CHANGE THAT WE ARE

00:34:00.271 --> 00:34:02.073

00:34:03.775 --> 00:34:05.376
RECOGNIZING THAT AGAIN AS

00:34:08.179 --> 00:34:10.982
IT'S ALSO A TWO YEAR SYSTEM SO.

00:34:11.048 --> 00:34:13.384
I APPRECIATE THE INTERACTION

00:34:13.451 --> 00:34:16.621

00:34:16.687 --> 00:34:18.322
GOOD AMENDMENTS.

00:34:18.389 --> 00:34:19.690
NOW.

00:34:19.757 --> 00:34:20.525
SB TWO OH SIX WHAT THIS BILL

00:34:20.591 --> 00:34:21.659
DOES IS GIVE OUR STUDENT

00:34:21.726 --> 00:34:23.294
ATHLETES THE SAME RIGHTS THAT

00:34:23.361 --> 00:34:25.096
OLYMPIC ATHLETES HAVE.

00:34:25.163 --> 00:34:26.798
AND THE SAME RIGHT THE EACH AND

00:34:26.864 --> 00:34:28.032
EVERYONE OF US HAVE UNDER

00:34:28.099 --> 00:34:30.134
CALIFORNIA LAW AND THAT IS THE

00:34:30.201 --> 00:34:32.970
RIGHT TO OUR OWN NAME IMAGE AND

00:34:33.037 --> 00:34:34.705
LIKENESS NO ONE ELSE UNDER

00:34:34.772 --> 00:34:36.841
CALIFORNIA LAW CAN MARKET YOUR

00:34:36.908 --> 00:34:39.076
NAME IMAGE OR LIKENESS.

00:34:39.143 --> 00:34:40.711

00:34:40.778 --> 00:34:43.047
ONLY STUDENT ATHLETES ARE

00:34:43.114 --> 00:34:44.215
PREVENTED FROM THE ACT.

00:34:44.282 --> 00:34:46.651
SB TWO OH SIX DOES NOT REQUIRE

00:34:46.717 --> 00:34:49.253
SCHOOLS TO PAY ATHLETES DIRECTLY.

00:34:49.320 --> 00:34:51.122
PURELY GIVES THEM THE RIGHT TO

00:34:51.189 --> 00:34:52.757
THEIR OWN NAME IMAGE AND

00:34:52.824 --> 00:34:54.325
LIKENESS SOME ATHLETES MAY

00:34:54.392 --> 00:34:56.727
CHOOSE NOT TO EXERCISE THAT

00:34:56.794 --> 00:34:56.961
RIGHT.

00:34:57.028 --> 00:34:58.396
OTHERS WILL.

00:34:58.463 --> 00:34:59.931
BUT I ASK YOU.

00:34:59.997 --> 00:35:03.201
IMAGINE IF ANY OTHER BILLION

00:35:03.267 --> 00:35:06.871
DOLLAR INDUSTRY. FOR EXAMPLE TV

00:35:06.938 --> 00:35:09.407
OR MOVIES RELY.

00:35:09.474 --> 00:35:11.442
ON COLLEGE STUDENTS AS THEIR

00:35:11.509 --> 00:35:14.045
PRIMARY SOURCE OF TALENT FOR THE

00:35:14.111 --> 00:35:15.913
REVENUE OF THEIR INDUSTRY YET

00:35:15.980 --> 00:35:17.548
DENIED THOSE STUDENTS ANY

00:35:17.615 --> 00:35:18.983
COMPENSATION.

00:35:19.050 --> 00:35:21.185
THERE WOULD BE UNIVERSAL OUTCRY

00:35:21.252 --> 00:35:22.720
NOW SOME OF YOU MAY BE THINKING

00:35:22.787 --> 00:35:23.788
BUT WAIT A MINUTE.

00:35:23.855 --> 00:35:24.856
STUDENT ATHLETES GET

00:35:24.922 --> 00:35:26.224
SCHOLARSHIPS.

00:35:26.290 --> 00:35:28.593
IF YOU LOOK AT ALL OF OUR

00:35:28.659 --> 00:35:30.194
COLLEGES OWN DATA.

00:35:30.261 --> 00:35:32.463
OVER HALF OF STUDENT ATHLETES

00:35:32.530 --> 00:35:35.099
GET NO SCHOLARSHIP IN OUR

00:35:35.166 --> 00:35:36.901

00:35:49.080 --> 00:35:50.414
SHE WROTE ALL FOUR YEARS

00:35:50.481 --> 00:35:52.250
QUALIFIED FOR THE OLYMPICS SHE

00:35:52.316 --> 00:35:54.118
DID NOT GET A SCHOLARSHIP TO HER

00:35:54.185 --> 00:35:57.154
SENIOR YEAR AND IT WAS PARTIAL.

00:35:57.221 --> 00:35:59.924
AND YET WITH HER ROWING SCHEDULE.

00:35:59.991 --> 00:36:02.193
AND HER ACADEMICS SHE COULD NOT

00:36:02.260 --> 00:36:03.628
HAVE A PART TIME JOB.

00:36:03.694 --> 00:36:06.230
SHE HAD NO ABILITY TO REALLY

00:36:06.297 --> 00:36:08.232
COVER ALL OF HEREXPENSES.

00:36:08.299 --> 00:36:11.469
ON SO OF COURSE SHE WAS HERE TO

00:36:11.536 --> 00:36:13.271
SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL --

00:36:13.337 --> 00:36:15.473
ANYWAY.

00:36:15.540 --> 00:36:17.875
YOU HAVE A LETTER FROM THE

00:36:17.942 --> 00:36:20.444
FORMER CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER

00:36:20.511 --> 00:36:22.713
OF THE NC TWO WAY DâN BOGAN WHO

00:36:22.780 --> 00:36:25.650

00:36:27.785 --> 00:36:29.287
BERKELEY.

00:36:29.353 --> 00:36:30.855
WHO IS IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL IN

00:36:30.922 --> 00:36:32.690
WHO WRITES THAT ONE OF THE KEY

00:36:32.757 --> 00:36:34.825
REASONS THAT HE BACKS THE BILL

00:36:34.892 --> 00:36:36.427
IS BECAUSE?

00:36:36.494 --> 00:36:38.262
DE NC TO RAISE RULES ARE

00:36:38.329 --> 00:36:41.265
CONTRADICTORY TO A CORE TENET OF

00:36:41.332 --> 00:36:43.234
THEIR OWN BYLAWS.

00:36:43.301 --> 00:36:45.836
AND THEIR OWN BYLAWS STATE.

00:36:45.903 --> 00:36:47.872
THAT THEIR RULES MUST ASSURE

00:36:47.939 --> 00:36:49.574
THAT ATHLETIC PARTICIPANTS ARE

00:36:49.640 --> 00:36:52.076
NOT TREATED DIFFERENTLY FROM ANY

00:36:52.143 --> 00:36:53.811
OTHER MEMBER OF THE STUDENT BODY.

00:36:53.878 --> 00:36:56.614
AND YET BY DENYING STUDENTS ANY

00:36:56.681 --> 00:36:58.683
ABILITY TO MARKET THEIR OWN NAME

00:36:58.749 --> 00:37:01.519
IMAGE AND LIKENESS THEY'RE

00:37:01.586 --> 00:37:03.120
TREATING THEM DIFFERENTLY.

00:37:03.187 --> 00:37:03.688
AND I WANT TO MAKE A SIMPLE

00:37:03.754 --> 00:37:05.256
POINT BECAUSE VERY OFTEN WE

00:37:05.323 --> 00:37:06.757
THINK IMMEDIATELY OF THE ELITE

00:37:06.824 --> 00:37:08.459
ATHLETE AND WE THINK WELL THIS

00:37:08.526 --> 00:37:10.461
IS JUST GOING TO ALLOW A FEW

00:37:10.528 --> 00:37:12.263
STUDENTS TO MAKE A LOT OF MONEY.

00:37:12.330 --> 00:37:14.932
BUT LET'S GIVE THE EXAMPLE OF

00:37:14.999 --> 00:37:17.802
THAT YOUNG PERSON WHO IS THE

00:37:17.868 --> 00:37:19.704
STAR ATHLETE FROM THEIR SMALL

00:37:19.770 --> 00:37:20.871
TOWN.

00:37:20.938 --> 00:37:23.307
AND THEY THEY ARE THE BIGGEST

00:37:23.374 --> 00:37:25.276
THING THAT THEY'RE THEY'RE JUST

00:37:25.343 --> 00:37:26.877
CELEBRATED IN THEIR SMALL TOWN.

00:37:26.944 --> 00:37:28.379
AND THEY GO OFF TO COLLEGE IN

00:37:28.446 --> 00:37:30.648
THERE MAYBE IN A MINOR SPORT.

00:37:30.715 --> 00:37:32.783
THEY DON'T GET A SCHOLARSHIP BUT

00:37:32.850 --> 00:37:34.318
PERHAPS THERE.

00:37:34.385 --> 00:37:36.921
A LOCAL CAR DEALERSHIP OR THEIR

00:37:36.988 --> 00:37:38.356
CORNICE CLUBBER THEIR ROTARY

00:37:38.422 --> 00:37:40.191
CLUB WANTS TO SPONSOR THEM HELP

00:37:40.257 --> 00:37:41.726
THEM SUPPORT THEM TO GO TO

00:37:41.792 --> 00:37:43.361
SCHOOL.

00:37:43.427 --> 00:37:44.862
THAT'S STUDENT WOULD BE DENIED.

00:37:44.929 --> 00:37:47.465
ANOTHER EXAMPLE YOU'RE THE HIGH

00:37:47.531 --> 00:37:48.733
SCHOOL FOOTBALL STAR.

00:37:48.799 --> 00:37:50.668
YOU'RE NOT THAT GOOD FOR GOING

00:37:50.735 --> 00:37:51.836
OFF TO PRO OR EVEN BEING AN

00:37:51.902 --> 00:37:54.538
ELITE SCHOOL BUT YOU'RE REALLY

00:37:54.605 --> 00:37:55.973
IMPORTANT YOUR TOWN.

00:37:56.040 --> 00:37:58.442
YOU CAN'T COME BACK AND COACH

00:37:58.509 --> 00:37:59.744
FOR TRAIN THE OTHER HIGH SCHOOL

00:37:59.810 --> 00:38:01.612
STUDENTS FOR ANY KIND OF

00:38:01.679 --> 00:38:03.648
COMPENSATION YOU CAN'T RUN A

00:38:03.714 --> 00:38:06.250
SPORTS CAMP FOR ANY COMPENSATION.

00:38:06.317 --> 00:38:09.887
ALL BECAUSE OF THE NC TO A ROLES

00:38:09.954 --> 00:38:11.589
WHY WOULD WE DENY THAT.

00:38:11.656 --> 00:38:13.491
AND ESPECIALLY WHEN WITH THE

00:38:13.557 --> 00:38:14.959
AMOUNT OF PRESSURE ON STUDENT

00:38:15.026 --> 00:38:17.094
ATHLETES IN THE TIME IT TAKES

00:38:17.161 --> 00:38:17.862
FOR THEM TO KEEP UP WITH THEIR

00:38:17.928 --> 00:38:18.763
SPORT.

00:38:18.829 --> 00:38:20.798
THEY REALLY CAN'T HAVE PART TIME

00:38:20.865 --> 00:38:21.499
JOBS.

00:38:21.565 --> 00:38:24.268
SO LET ME STOP AND TURN IT OVER

00:38:24.335 --> 00:38:26.003
TO MY AUTHOR.

00:38:26.070 --> 00:38:27.171

TO ATHLETES AND SPORTS HERE AND

00:38:41.786 --> 00:38:42.787
AMERICA.

00:38:42.853 --> 00:38:44.522
IT'S ABOUT FAIRNESS THIS IS NOT

00:38:44.588 --> 00:38:46.457
A ISSUE OF SPORTS IT'S ABOUT

00:38:46.524 --> 00:38:48.492
FAIRNESS IT'S ABOUT ALLOWING

00:38:48.559 --> 00:38:50.194
THESE YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN TO

00:38:50.261 --> 00:38:51.529
TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT SMALL

00:38:51.595 --> 00:38:53.130
WINDOW.

00:38:53.197 --> 00:38:54.732

00:39:06.277 --> 00:39:08.212
ONLY 2% OF COLLEGE ATHLETES EVER

00:39:08.279 --> 00:39:09.613
MAKE IT TO THE PRO LEVEL AND

00:39:09.680 --> 00:39:10.448
MANY OF THEM HAVE CAREERS LESS

00:39:10.514 --> 00:39:12.016
THAN THREE YEARS.

00:39:12.083 --> 00:39:14.418
CHAU SEEING THAT AS A COLLEGE

00:39:14.485 --> 00:39:16.854
ATHLETE WERE YOU ARE FILLING

00:39:16.921 --> 00:39:19.490
ARENAS AND STADIUMS ALL ACROSS

00:39:19.557 --> 00:39:20.991
THE COUNTRY WERE USE.

00:39:21.058 --> 00:39:23.094
SELLING SEATS AND HELPING SELL

00:39:23.160 --> 00:39:26.097
MERCHANDISE THAT YOU BENEFIT NOT

00:39:26.163 --> 00:39:28.799
ONE IOTA OTHER THAN YES YOU GET

00:39:28.866 --> 00:39:29.333
A SCHOLARSHIP [inaudible]

00:39:29.400 --> 00:39:31.669
BUT I WENT TO COLLEGE WITH

00:39:31.736 --> 00:39:33.070
PLENTY OF SCHOLARSHIP ATHLETES

00:39:33.137 --> 00:39:35.206
WHO STRUGGLE TO MAKE ENDS MEET

00:39:35.272 --> 00:39:36.507
FROM MONTH TO MONTH.

00:39:36.574 --> 00:39:38.309
MANY BORROWED MONEY FROM ME ON A

00:39:38.375 --> 00:39:39.710
REGULAR BASIS TO PUT.

00:39:39.777 --> 00:39:42.246
GAS IN THE CAR IF THEY HAD A CAR

00:39:42.313 --> 00:39:43.414
AND MANY OF THEM DID HAVE CARS

00:39:43.481 --> 00:39:45.750
BUT THE BY MAIL OR SOMETHING OF

00:39:45.816 --> 00:39:47.785
THAT NATURE SO A SCHOLARSHIP IN

00:39:47.852 --> 00:39:49.019
AND OF ITSELF.

00:39:49.086 --> 00:39:50.187
DOESN'T TAKE CARE OF ALL THE

00:39:50.254 --> 00:39:52.256
NECESSITIES THAT YOU NEED TO

00:39:52.323 --> 00:39:55.359
SURVIVE -- OUTSIDE A ROOM AND

00:39:55.426 --> 00:39:57.294
BOARD AND I TUITION TO LOT MORE

00:39:57.361 --> 00:39:59.830
EXPENSES AS YOU KNOW TO GO TO

00:39:59.897 --> 00:40:01.332
COLLEGE NOWADAYS SO -- AGAIN

00:40:01.398 --> 00:40:02.767
THIS IS THE ISSUE OF FAIRNESS

00:40:02.833 --> 00:40:05.603
AND AS I SAID CIVIL RIGHTS

00:40:05.669 --> 00:40:07.571
BECAUSE OF 3% OF THE

00:40:07.638 --> 00:40:09.373
UNDERGRADUATE POPULATION AFRICAN

00:40:09.440 --> 00:40:12.376
AMERICANS MAKE UP JUST 3% OF THE

00:40:12.443 --> 00:40:14.211
UNDERGRADUATE -- Và UNIVERSITY

00:40:14.278 --> 00:40:16.313
IN COLLEGE POPULATION BUT THEY

00:40:16.380 --> 00:40:17.982
MAKE UP OVER 50%.

00:40:18.048 --> 00:40:19.350
OF THE ATHLETES THAT PLAYED

00:40:19.416 --> 00:40:22.086
FOOTBALL AND BASKETBALL AT THESE

00:40:22.153 --> 00:40:23.988
MAJOR UNIVERSITIES MANY OF THESE

00:40:24.054 --> 00:40:26.090
INDIVIDUALS COME FROM LOW INCOME

00:40:26.157 --> 00:40:27.324
FAMILIES.

00:40:27.391 --> 00:40:28.893
BUT THEY'RE RECRUITED BY COACHES

00:40:28.959 --> 00:40:30.661
NOW WILL MAKE MILLIONS OF

00:40:30.728 --> 00:40:32.963
DOLLARS COACHES NOW MAKE MORE

00:40:33.030 --> 00:40:34.999
THAN COLLEGE PRESIDENTS.

00:40:35.065 --> 00:40:36.600
COACHES WHO ARE ABLE.

00:40:36.667 --> 00:40:38.669
TO MONETIZE THEIR IMAGE IN THEIR

00:40:38.736 --> 00:40:40.604
LIKENESS BECAUSE MANY OF THEM

00:40:40.671 --> 00:40:42.439
HAVE ENDORSEMENT DEALS.

00:40:42.506 --> 00:40:43.340
AND THAT.

00:40:43.407 --> 00:40:44.775
MAKES IT VERY ATTRACTIVE AND

00:40:44.842 --> 00:40:46.210
THAT'S PART OF THE NEGOTIATIONS

00:40:46.277 --> 00:40:48.212

00:41:06.363 --> 00:41:08.132
AGAIN FAIRNESS AND MAKING SURE

00:41:08.199 --> 00:41:09.500

STRUGGLE TO STAND IN COLLEGE AND

00:41:12.303 --> 00:41:14.205
AS SENATOR SKINNER STATED THIS

00:41:14.271 --> 00:41:15.539
WILL NOT AFFECT THE UNIVERSITY

00:41:15.606 --> 00:41:17.875
NOT ONE IOTA NOT ONE DIME

00:41:17.942 --> 00:41:19.376
BECAUSE OF HIS SPONSOR WANTS.

00:41:19.443 --> 00:41:20.978
TO PAY THEM FOR THAT AGAIN IT

00:41:21.045 --> 00:41:22.713
DOESN'T COME OUT OF THE COLLEGE

00:41:22.780 --> 00:41:24.715
KATIE WHATSOEVER COLLEGES WILL

00:41:24.782 --> 00:41:26.116
NOT BE PAYING FOR THAT IT WOULD

00:41:26.183 --> 00:41:27.117
BE THE INDIVIDUAL.

00:41:37.294 --> 00:41:38.495
PEOPLE SAY WELL IT'S GOING TO

00:41:38.562 --> 00:41:41.465
ENCOURAGE FOLKS TO LEAVE COLLEGE

00:41:41.532 --> 00:41:42.333
YOUNG STUDENTS TO STAY IN

00:41:42.399 --> 00:41:43.200
COLLEGE.

00:41:43.267 --> 00:41:44.635

SEATS AND AGAIN THIS IS

00:42:10.494 --> 00:42:11.962
OPPORTUNITY FOR THEM TO TAKE

00:42:12.029 --> 00:42:13.464
ADVANTAGE OF THAT SMALL WINDOW.

00:42:13.530 --> 00:42:15.833

00:43:57.801 --> 00:43:58.736
NATIONAL TEAM.

00:43:58.802 --> 00:43:59.737
I WENT ON TO EARN ALL AMERICAN

00:43:59.803 --> 00:44:00.804
THE NATIONAL FRESHMAN OF THE

00:44:00.871 --> 00:44:01.939
YEAR HONORS DURING MY FIRST YEAR

00:44:02.006 --> 00:44:03.307
AT STANFORD.

00:44:03.374 --> 00:44:05.275
UNFORTUNATELY FOR ME HOWEVER.

00:44:05.342 --> 00:44:06.276
I SUFFERED TWO CONCUSSIONS AND

00:44:06.343 --> 00:44:07.644
ENSUING COMPLICATIONS DURING MY

00:44:07.711 --> 00:44:09.013
FIRST SEASON AT STANFORD WHICH

00:44:09.079 --> 00:44:10.481
LED TO MY MEDICAL RETIREMENT AT

00:44:10.547 --> 00:44:12.216
AGE TWENTY MY CAREER WAS OVER

00:44:12.282 --> 00:44:13.617
BEFORE IT EVEN STARTED.

00:44:13.684 --> 00:44:14.952
LIKE MOST COLLEGE ATHLETES MY

00:44:15.019 --> 00:44:16.420
FAMILY HAS MADE MANY FINANCIAL

00:44:16.487 --> 00:44:18.088
SACRIFICES OVER THE YEARS IN

00:44:18.155 --> 00:44:19.256
ORDER TO HELP ME PROGRESS IS

00:44:19.323 --> 00:44:20.858
BOTH THE STUDENT AND AN ATHLETE.

00:44:20.924 --> 00:44:22.092
BUT NOW THAT MY CAREER IS OVER

00:44:22.159 --> 00:44:24.194
IT IS CLEAR THAT EVEN BEING ONE

00:44:24.261 --> 00:44:25.295
OF THE TOP PLAYERS IN A SPORT

00:44:25.362 --> 00:44:26.563
WITH PROFESSIONAL OPPORTUNITIES

00:44:26.630 --> 00:44:28.065
DOES NOT GUARANTEE THAT THOSE

00:44:28.132 --> 00:44:30.667
INVESTMENT OF TIME.

00:44:30.734 --> 00:44:31.668
AND MONEY WILL PAY OFF.

00:44:31.735 --> 00:44:32.403
THE NCAA PROFITS FROM THE

00:44:32.469 --> 00:44:33.871
PERFORMANCE AND LABOR OF MINORS

00:44:33.937 --> 00:44:35.439
AND YOUNG ADULTS WHILE DENYING

00:44:35.506 --> 00:44:36.740
THOSE SAME PERFORMERS THE RIGHT

00:44:36.807 --> 00:44:37.941
TO EARN MONEY BASED ON THEIR

00:44:38.008 --> 00:44:39.777
ATHLETIC TALENTS AND SUCCESSES

00:44:39.843 --> 00:44:41.345
THROUGH OTHER MEANS.

00:44:41.412 --> 00:44:43.213
IN FACT THE NCAA HAS A MONOPOLY

00:44:43.280 --> 00:44:44.348
ON THE ADVERTISING AND PUBLICITY

00:44:44.415 --> 00:44:45.649
RIGHTS OF ALL AMATEUR ATHLETES

00:44:45.716 --> 00:44:46.917
IN THE COUNTRY.

00:44:46.984 --> 00:44:48.552
WELL SB TWO OH SIX WOULD HELP

00:44:48.619 --> 00:44:50.687
ALL CALIFORNIA ATHLETES IT WOULD

00:44:50.754 --> 00:44:52.122
PARTICULARLY BENEFIT WOMEN.

00:44:52.189 --> 00:44:53.624
THE END SAY IS STILL THE PREMIER

00:44:53.690 --> 00:44:55.125
ATHLETIC PLATFORM FOR MOST

00:44:55.192 --> 00:44:56.493
FEMALE ATHLETES IN AMERICA BUT

00:44:56.560 --> 00:44:58.262
UNIVERSITIES HAVE CHOSEN TO MAKE

00:44:58.328 --> 00:44:59.763
MEN'S FOOTBALL AND BASKETBALL

00:44:59.830 --> 00:45:01.031
TEAMS THEIR PRIORITIES.

00:45:01.098 --> 00:45:02.399
FEMALE ATHLETES WHO ARE THE BEST

00:45:02.466 --> 00:45:03.534
IN THEIR SPORTS TO PHYSICALLY

00:45:03.600 --> 00:45:04.668
HAVE FEWER PROFESSIONAL

00:45:04.735 --> 00:45:06.737
OPPORTUNITIES AFTER COLLEGE AS

00:45:06.804 --> 00:45:07.604
THEIR MALE COUNTERPARTS IN WOULD

00:45:07.671 --> 00:45:09.173
BENEFIT QUICK GREATLY FROM BEING

00:45:09.239 --> 00:45:10.240
ABLE TO MARKET THEMSELVES DURING

00:45:10.307 --> 00:45:12.976
COLLEGE. FOR THE 98% OF COLLEGE

00:45:13.043 --> 00:45:14.278
ATHLETES THAT WILL NEVER GO PRO

00:45:14.344 --> 00:45:15.979
COLLEGE IS THE ONLY TIME THEY

00:45:16.046 --> 00:45:17.214
HAVE TO PROFIT OFF THEIR HARD

00:45:17.281 --> 00:45:18.615
EARNED ATHLETICS SUCCESSES AND

00:45:18.682 --> 00:45:20.017
THEY ARE CURRENTLY DENIED THAT

00:45:20.084 --> 00:45:20.951
OPPORTUNITY.

00:45:21.018 --> 00:45:22.352
NO OTHER COLLEGE STUDENTS ARE

00:45:22.419 --> 00:45:23.787
TREATED THIS WAY MUSICIANS

THEIR EARNING CAPACITIES.

00:45:32.062 --> 00:45:33.330
IN HIGH SCHOOL I HAD TO TURN

00:45:33.397 --> 00:45:34.565
DOWN STIPENDS ENDORSEMENTS AND

00:45:34.631 --> 00:45:36.400
EVEN A TV SHOW PRIOR TO COLLEGE

00:45:36.467 --> 00:45:37.868
IN ORDER TO STAY ELIGIBLE TO

00:45:37.935 --> 00:45:39.269
PLAY IN THE NCAA.

00:45:39.336 --> 00:45:40.704
I WAS ON TRACK TO BE ONE OF THE

00:45:40.771 --> 00:45:42.139
FEW COLLEGE ATHLETES THAT WOULD

00:45:42.206 --> 00:45:43.373
HAVE HAD A PROFESSIONAL CAREER.

00:45:43.440 --> 00:45:44.675
BUT BECAUSE I RECEIVED A CAREER

00:45:44.741 --> 00:45:48.278
ENDING IN LIFE CHANGING BRAIN

00:45:48.345 --> 00:45:49.513
INJURY DURING COLLEGE.

00:45:49.580 --> 00:45:50.447
I NEVER GOT TO SEE ALL OF MY

ONE COLLEGE ATHLETE SUFFER FROM

00:45:55.319 --> 00:45:56.753
CHRONIC SPORTS INJURIES.

00:45:56.820 --> 00:45:58.088
AND WILL BE FACING PAIN AND

00:45:58.155 --> 00:45:59.423
MEDICAL BILLS FOR THE RIGHTS OF

00:46:00.424 --> 00:46:02.526
PARTICIPATION IN NCAA SPORTS.

00:46:02.593 --> 00:46:04.194
MY HOPE IS THAT SB TWO OH SIX

00:46:04.261 --> 00:46:05.195

00:46:05.262 --> 00:46:07.097
OF EVERY BACKGROUND A CHANCE TO

00:46:07.164 --> 00:46:08.932
EARN BACK EVEN JUST A LITTLE OF

00:46:08.999 --> 00:46:09.533
WHAT THEY SACRIFICE FOR THEIR

00:46:09.600 --> 00:46:10.701

00:46:10.767 --> 00:46:11.735
EVEN EVERY SINGLE ATHLETE

00:46:11.802 --> 00:46:13.137
DESERVES A CHANCE TO MONETIZE

00:46:13.203 --> 00:46:15.105
HIS OR HER HARD WORK AND TALENT

00:46:15.172 --> 00:46:16.306
IF YOU'RE STATE SHE CHOOSES TO

00:46:16.373 --> 00:46:17.141
DO SO.

00:46:17.207 --> 00:46:18.375
IT IS NEVER ENOUGH TO HAVE LESS

00:46:18.442 --> 00:46:20.077

NOT NECESSARILY THE CONVERSATION.

00:53:50.093 --> 00:53:51.027
I BRIEFLY WANT TO SHARE MY

00:53:51.094 --> 00:53:52.896
THOUGHTS THERE ARE MANY

00:53:52.963 --> 00:53:54.030
POTENTIAL UNINTENDED

00:53:54.097 --> 00:53:57.000
CONSEQUENCES -- WHICH IN THE END

00:53:57.067 --> 00:53:59.135
COULD HARM THE VERY STUDENTS --

00:53:59.202 --> 00:54:00.737
THAT THE AUTHOR'S INTENT TO HELP.

00:54:00.804 --> 00:54:01.838
THERE IS A POSSIBLE SCENARIO

00:54:01.905 --> 00:54:03.373
WITH AUTHORS WORLD WORKS AND

00:54:03.440 --> 00:54:05.041
THERE MIGHT NOT BE ANY NEGATIVE

00:54:05.108 --> 00:54:06.509
CONSEQUENCES.

00:54:06.576 --> 00:54:08.011
BUT I WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK TO

00:54:08.078 --> 00:54:10.146
SEVERAL POSSIBLE IMPACTS WHICH

00:54:10.213 --> 00:54:11.314
WOULD LEAVE A HARSH FOOT PRINT

00:54:11.381 --> 00:54:13.049
POSSIBLY.

00:54:13.116 --> 00:54:14.684
THE IRST COULD BE A WORLD WHERE

00:54:14.751 --> 00:54:15.719
CALIFORNIAN OVERSEAS ARE

00:54:15.785 --> 00:54:18.254
RESTRICTED FROM COMPETING FOR NC

00:54:18.321 --> 00:54:19.489
DOUBLE A CHAMPIONSHIPS.

00:54:19.556 --> 00:54:21.791
WITH OVER TWENTY YEARS OF

00:54:21.858 --> 00:54:22.425
EXPERIENCE WORKING IN NC DOUBLE

00:54:22.492 --> 00:54:24.461
A I DON'T BELIEVE THE TWO WORLDS

00:54:24.527 --> 00:54:25.862
CAN CO EXIST.

00:54:25.929 --> 00:54:27.163
I DON'T THINK YOU CAN HAVE ONE

00:54:27.230 --> 00:54:29.232
WORLD WHERE THE RULES SAY AXE

00:54:29.299 --> 00:54:31.167
AND THE OTHER WORLD SAYS WHY AND

00:54:31.234 --> 00:54:32.836
WE MEET ON THE SAME FEEL THE

00:54:32.902 --> 00:54:35.171
COMPETITION.

00:54:35.238 --> 00:54:35.772
I THINK THEY'RE DIAMETRICALLY

00:54:35.839 --> 00:54:37.273
OPPOSED.

00:54:37.340 --> 00:54:38.742
AS A MEMBER OF THE NC DOUBLE A

00:54:38.808 --> 00:54:40.844
WERE REQUIRED. TO FOLLOW THE

00:54:40.910 --> 00:54:42.112
RULES.

00:54:42.178 --> 00:54:43.113

00:54:43.179 --> 00:54:45.348

VIOLATIONS AND BEAR THE

00:54:47.717 --> 00:54:49.019
REPLICATIONS.

00:54:49.085 --> 00:54:50.487
MY EXPERIENCE IS THAT SHOULD A

00:54:50.553 --> 00:54:52.389
SCHOOL REPEATEDLY BREAK NC

00:54:52.455 --> 00:54:53.757
DOUBLE A RULES HARSH PENALTIES

00:54:53.823 --> 00:54:56.726
CAN FOLLOW IN EFFECT COMPETITION

00:54:56.793 --> 00:54:58.461
SCHOLARSHIPS AND MUCH OTHER.

00:54:58.528 --> 00:54:59.896
AN ADDITIONAL CONCERN A REAL

00:54:59.963 --> 00:55:01.965
WORLD CONCERN FOR ME IS THE NAME

00:55:02.032 --> 00:55:03.967
IMAGE AND LIKENESS.

00:55:04.034 --> 00:55:06.269
WHAT ARE THE PROTECTIONS HERE?

00:55:06.336 --> 00:55:07.170
WHAT STOP THIS DO NOT LEAVE FROM

00:55:07.237 --> 00:55:09.105
SIGNING A DEAL WITH MGM GRAND

00:55:09.172 --> 00:55:10.707
CASINO AND SPORTS BOOK?

00:55:10.774 --> 00:55:12.008
SPORTS GAMBLING IS A BILLION

00:55:12.075 --> 00:55:13.410
DOLLAR INDUSTRY AND NOW FOOTBALL

00:55:13.476 --> 00:55:14.844
PLAYERS ARE BASKETBALL PLAYERS

00:55:14.911 --> 00:55:16.713
MIGHT BE TEMPTED AND HAVE A

00:55:16.780 --> 00:55:18.181
CONFLICT OF INTEREST.

00:55:18.248 --> 00:55:19.749
WE'VE HAD A HISTORY IN NC DOUBLE

00:55:19.816 --> 00:55:23.186
A OF POINT SHAVING SCANDALS

00:55:23.253 --> 00:55:24.821
BEFORE NOW IS THIS AN

00:55:24.888 --> 00:55:26.156
ENDORSEMENT TO GO OUT THERE AND

00:55:26.222 --> 00:55:27.757
OPEN UP ANOTHER DOOR ANOTHER

00:55:27.824 --> 00:55:29.426
PANDORA'S BOX.

00:55:29.492 --> 00:55:32.228
THE SECOND IS CANNABIS.

00:55:32.295 --> 00:55:34.197
CANNABIS IS THE IS A BANNED

00:55:34.264 --> 00:55:36.132
SUBSTANCE THE NC DOUBLE A WHAT

00:55:36.199 --> 00:55:37.567
IF A STUDENT ATHLETE SIGNED AN

00:55:37.634 --> 00:55:38.802
ENDORSEMENT DEAL WITH.

00:55:38.868 --> 00:55:40.203
A DISPENSARY.

00:55:40.270 --> 00:55:42.605
WHAT IF PART OF THE -- INCENTIVE

00:55:42.672 --> 00:55:44.407
THERE IS A REQUIREMENT TO USE

00:55:44.474 --> 00:55:46.076
SAID.

00:55:46.142 --> 00:55:48.178
CANNABIS THAT'S IN DIRECT

00:55:48.244 --> 00:55:49.846
VIOLATION OF THE RULES.

00:55:49.913 --> 00:55:51.247
AGAIN THESE ARE UNINTENDED

00:55:51.314 --> 00:55:52.882
CONSEQUENCES WHERE ARE THE

00:55:52.949 --> 00:55:55.418
PROTECTIONS THAT.

00:55:55.485 --> 00:55:55.985
PREVENT THESE THINGS FROM

00:55:56.052 --> 00:55:57.287
HAPPENING.

00:55:57.353 --> 00:55:58.722
THAT'S WHY I URGE.

00:55:58.788 --> 00:56:00.657
A PAUSE THIS IS A GOOD

00:56:00.724 --> 00:56:02.525
CONVERSATION.

00:56:02.592 --> 00:56:03.660
IT'S THE MECHANISM THAT I

00:56:03.727 --> 00:56:07.230
ACTUALLY OPPOSE.

00:56:07.297 --> 00:56:08.765
IT'S IMPORTANT I'M GLAD THAT

00:56:08.832 --> 00:56:09.933
WE'RE ALL HERE TODAY HAVING AN

00:56:09.999 --> 00:56:11.901
OPEN CONVERSATION.

00:56:11.968 --> 00:56:13.803
AND I WOULD URGE THAT WE TAKE A

00:56:13.870 --> 00:56:15.505
FURTHER IN DEPTH LOOK THAT WE WE

00:56:15.572 --> 00:56:17.006
BRING IN MORE STUDENT ATHLETES

00:56:17.073 --> 00:56:18.274
TO BRING IN MORE COACHES WE

00:56:18.341 --> 00:56:19.476
BRING IN MORE STAFF AND

00:56:19.542 --> 00:56:21.478
ADMINISTRATION AND AND THE NC

00:56:21.544 --> 00:56:22.746
DOUBLE A DOES.

00:56:22.812 --> 00:56:23.813
BECOME MORE INVOLVED THAN I

00:56:23.880 --> 00:56:25.949
WOULD URGE SOME TIME TO ALLOW

00:56:26.015 --> 00:56:27.650
THE NC DOUBLE A WORKING GROUP TO

00:56:27.717 --> 00:56:30.887

00:56:30.954 --> 00:56:32.489

00:56:32.555 --> 00:56:33.923
BELIEVE.

00:56:33.990 --> 00:56:36.192
AND AGAIN I'M I'M NOT SURE WHAT

00:56:36.259 --> 00:56:37.861
THE RUSHES TO GET THERE.

00:56:37.927 --> 00:56:39.195
THESE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES

00:56:39.262 --> 00:56:40.897
ARE POTENTIALLY VERY REAL AND

00:56:40.964 --> 00:56:42.599
ONCE THAT DOORS OPEN IT'S VERY

00:56:42.665 --> 00:56:44.000
TOUGH TO GO BACK.

CHANCES OFFICE WE DON'T HAVE A A

00:57:48.565 --> 00:57:49.966
POSITION ON THE BILL.

00:57:50.033 --> 00:57:51.668
WE ARE SUPPORTIVE OF THE INTENT

00:57:51.734 --> 00:57:52.869
BUT THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS ARE

00:57:52.936 --> 00:57:55.104
A BIT CONCERNING JUST BECAUSE

00:57:55.171 --> 00:57:56.639
THE CHANCES OFFICE HAS NOT.

00:57:56.706 --> 00:57:57.774
TRADITIONALLY HAD A ROLE IN

00:57:57.841 --> 00:57:59.342
ATHLETICS SO THERE MAY BE SOME

00:57:59.409 --> 00:58:01.177
ADDITIONAL RESOURCES AT OUR

00:58:01.244 --> 00:58:04.247
AGENCY MAY NEED TO COMPLETE THE

00:58:04.314 --> 00:58:04.747

00:58:10.687 --> 00:58:13.289
YES MISTER PATTERSON.

00:58:15.358 --> 00:58:16.860
QUESTIONS -- I I'M CONFLICTED

00:58:16.926 --> 00:58:21.464
HERE -- AND I WANT.

00:58:21.531 --> 00:58:22.732
TO ADDRESS THE QUESTION

00:58:22.799 --> 00:58:24.133
SPECIFICALLY WITH RESPECT

00:58:24.200 --> 00:58:26.436
RESPECT TO FRESNO STATE

00:58:26.502 --> 00:58:27.570
UNIVERSITY I ALMA.

00:58:27.637 --> 00:58:30.006
ALARM I REPRESENT THE UNIVERSITY

00:58:30.073 --> 00:58:30.306
[inaudible]

00:58:30.373 --> 00:58:31.841
IT.

00:58:31.908 --> 00:58:35.178
FEELS LIKE WE'RE PLAYING A GAME

00:58:35.245 --> 00:58:38.414
OF CHICKEN WITH THE NC TWO WAY

00:58:38.481 --> 00:58:38.715
[inaudible]

00:58:38.781 --> 00:58:41.684
AND ESTABLISHING THIS

00:58:41.751 --> 00:58:41.985
[inaudible]

00:58:42.051 --> 00:58:43.686
RULE.

00:58:43.753 --> 00:58:46.956
THAT PUTS THE STATE OUTSIDE OF

00:58:47.023 --> 00:58:48.391
THE AND SEE TO IT I I I I I

00:58:48.458 --> 00:58:50.493
UNDERSTAND THAT.

00:58:50.560 --> 00:58:54.264
BUT WE ALSO HAVE AN NC TO A

00:58:54.330 --> 00:58:57.166
SERIOUS INQUIRY INTO THIS.

00:58:57.233 --> 00:58:58.501
SO PART OF ME SAYS I THINK WE

00:58:58.568 --> 00:59:00.603
MADE OUR POINT.

00:59:00.670 --> 00:59:01.437
WHAT I WANT TO ASK IS THE

00:59:01.504 --> 00:59:04.374
IMPLEMENTATION?

00:59:04.440 --> 00:59:08.511
WHEN DOES THIS BECOME --

00:59:08.578 --> 00:59:10.747
ACTUALIZED.

00:59:10.813 --> 00:59:15.952
AND IF THERE SHOULD BE -- REPORT

00:59:16.019 --> 00:59:19.022
FROM THE NC TO WEIGH THAT IN

00:59:19.088 --> 00:59:20.757
SOME WAYS MY MIRRORS.

00:59:20.823 --> 00:59:21.758
BUT MAYBE DOESN'T DO EVERYTHING

00:59:21.824 --> 00:59:23.893
THE BILL DOES.

00:59:23.960 --> 00:59:25.094
AS THE AUTHORS WOULD WOULD WOULD

00:59:25.161 --> 00:59:26.596
YOU BE.

00:59:26.663 --> 00:59:29.232
COMMITTING TO STEPPING BACK.

00:59:29.299 --> 00:59:31.601
LOOKING AT IT [inaudible]

00:59:31.668 --> 00:59:33.670
BEFORE IMPLEMENTATION.

00:59:33.736 --> 00:59:36.873
AND IF A NATIONAL -- NC TO A

00:59:36.940 --> 00:59:38.741
DECISION.

00:59:38.808 --> 00:59:41.177
WAS CLOSE ENOUGH.

00:59:41.244 --> 00:59:42.211
COULD COULD YOU AND WOULD YOU

00:59:42.278 --> 00:59:45.782
LIVE WITH THAT.

00:59:45.848 --> 00:59:47.650
THROUGH THE YEAR GET ON SO THE

00:59:47.717 --> 00:59:50.520
BILL IS DESIGNED.

00:59:50.586 --> 00:59:52.322
DO NOT TAKE AFFECT.

00:59:52.388 --> 00:59:55.458
UNTIL.

00:59:55.525 --> 00:59:56.025
TWENTY TWENTY THREE AND THE

00:59:56.092 --> 00:59:57.260
PURPOSE OF THAT.

00:59:57.327 --> 01:00:00.797
IS FOR THE NC TWO WAY.

01:00:00.863 --> 01:00:03.366
IF THEY CHOOSE. TO RESPOND TO

01:00:03.433 --> 01:00:05.535
GIVE THEM THAT TIME IT ALSO IF

01:00:05.601 --> 01:00:06.736
YOU READ THE LANGUAGE IN THE

01:00:06.803 --> 01:00:09.305
BILL IT STATES EXPLICITLY.

01:00:09.372 --> 01:00:10.006
THAT THE LEGISLATURE WOULD

01:00:10.073 --> 01:00:11.874
REVISIT.

01:00:11.941 --> 01:00:13.409
IF THE NC TWO EIGHT

01:00:13.476 --> 01:00:16.179
SUBSTANTIALLY CHANGES THE RULES.

01:00:16.245 --> 01:00:19.015
NOW THE OTHER THING I WANTED TO

01:00:19.082 --> 01:00:20.783
IN FRAMING THIS IS.

01:00:20.850 --> 01:00:22.385
IT'S IRONIC TO ME THAT WE HAVE

01:00:22.452 --> 01:00:25.355
OUR COLLEGES HERE IN OPPOSITION.

01:00:25.421 --> 01:00:27.590
BECAUSE THE NC TWO EIGHT IS AN

01:00:27.657 --> 01:00:29.759
ASSOCIATION OF COLLEGES.

01:00:29.826 --> 01:00:31.527
THESE ARE COLLEGES OPPOSING

01:00:31.594 --> 01:00:33.730
COLLEGES.

01:00:33.796 --> 01:00:35.698
OUR OWN COLLEGES.

01:00:35.765 --> 01:00:39.035
HAVE THE ABILITY. TO WORK WITH

01:00:39.102 --> 01:00:40.770
THE NC TWO WAY TO CHANGE THE

01:00:40.837 --> 01:00:42.071
RULES.

01:00:42.138 --> 01:00:45.408
AND IN FACT THE NC TO A HAS A

01:00:45.475 --> 01:00:45.641
HISTORY.

01:00:45.708 --> 01:00:49.212
OF FITS AND STARTS IN ALL

01:00:49.278 --> 01:00:53.149
ASPECTS OF IN OUR ACTUALLY WE AS

01:00:53.216 --> 01:00:54.384
I INDICATED I HAVE TECHNICAL

01:00:54.450 --> 01:00:56.419
WITNESS HERE AND I WOULD LIKE TO

01:00:56.486 --> 01:00:57.420
HAVE HIM.

01:00:57.487 --> 01:00:59.622
PROVIDE THAT INFORMATION AND

01:00:59.689 --> 01:01:02.859
ALSO THE LEGAL RESPONSE TO THE

01:01:02.925 --> 01:01:04.627
ISSUE OF WHETHER THE NC TWO

01:01:04.694 --> 01:01:06.295
EIGHT COULD.

01:01:06.362 --> 01:01:08.931
PREVENT CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS FROM

01:01:08.998 --> 01:01:10.600
PARTICIPATING FOR EXAMPLE AND

01:01:10.666 --> 01:01:12.402
CHAMPIONSHIPS WOULD THAT BE

01:01:12.468 --> 01:01:14.804
AMENABLE TO THE CHAIR.

01:01:14.871 --> 01:01:16.406
BRIEFLY IT.

01:01:16.472 --> 01:01:24.047
HE'S A LAWYER.

01:01:24.113 --> 01:01:25.615
I'M IT DID IT DID THIS IS MY

01:01:25.681 --> 01:01:26.516
PERIOD TO THE QUESTION YES I

01:01:26.582 --> 01:01:27.350
WOULD MUCH RATHER HEAR FROM THE

01:01:27.417 --> 01:01:33.356
AUTHOR SPECIFICALLY AND DIRECTLY.

01:01:33.423 --> 01:01:33.956
AND NOT AND NOT A LAWYER'S AYE

01:01:34.023 --> 01:01:34.524
AYE.

01:01:34.590 --> 01:01:35.425
QUESTION IS.

01:01:35.491 --> 01:01:37.527
IT IS VERY VERY YES EXPLICIT YES

01:01:37.593 --> 01:01:38.928
IF IF IF YOU IF THIS.

01:01:38.995 --> 01:01:41.998
BILL MOVES.

01:01:42.065 --> 01:01:44.634
BECAUSE THEY MOVED THE BALL.

01:01:44.700 --> 01:01:45.635
AND NC TO A DOZEN FACT COME BACK

01:01:45.701 --> 01:01:46.702
WITH SOMETHING.

01:01:46.769 --> 01:01:50.940
REASONABLY ACCEPTABLE PRIOR --

01:01:51.007 --> 01:01:54.777
TO THE BILL BECOMING --

01:01:54.844 --> 01:01:56.746
EFFECTIVE RIGHT SO IT'S NOT EASY

01:01:56.813 --> 01:01:59.082
YOU ARE ARE YOU COMMITTING.

01:01:59.148 --> 01:02:00.650
AS AUTHORS HERE AND NOW.

01:02:00.716 --> 01:02:02.085
THAT THAT SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES

01:02:02.151 --> 01:02:04.520
WOULD CAUSE YOU TO IN FACT

01:02:04.587 --> 01:02:05.088
REVISIT THE BILL.

01:02:05.154 --> 01:02:08.724
AND PRESENT WASTE WHERE WE ARE

01:02:08.791 --> 01:02:11.661
NOT IN CONFLICT IN CONFLICT.

01:02:11.727 --> 01:02:13.329
THE VERY.

01:02:13.396 --> 01:02:15.264
ABSOLUTELY IN THE VERY WARM.

01:02:15.331 --> 01:02:17.633
THE VERY WAY THE BILL IS WRITTEN

01:02:17.700 --> 01:02:19.102
MAKES THAT COMMITMENT.

01:02:19.168 --> 01:02:20.403
THE VERY WAY THE BILL AS WRITTEN

01:02:20.470 --> 01:02:22.004
IF YOU LOOK AT THE VERY LANGUAGE

01:02:22.071 --> 01:02:23.739
THAT WE'RE PUTTING INTO STATUTE

01:02:23.806 --> 01:02:25.141
IT MAKES THAT COMMITMENT.

01:02:25.208 --> 01:02:27.210
AND BUT THE REASON I FEEL THAT

01:02:27.276 --> 01:02:30.413
THE BILL IS STILL NECESSARY EVEN

01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:32.181
WITH THE THREE YEAR DELAY.

01:02:32.248 --> 01:02:34.217
IS THE ANC TO A COMMISSIONED

01:02:34.283 --> 01:02:36.719
THEIR OWN THIS IS NOT THE FIRST

01:02:36.786 --> 01:02:38.287
TASK FORCE THEY'VE HAD ON SUCH A

01:02:38.354 --> 01:02:38.921
SUBJECT.

01:02:38.988 --> 01:02:41.124
THEY ASKED CONDOLEEZZA RICE

01:02:41.190 --> 01:02:42.125
WHICH YOU KNOW HAS AN

01:02:42.191 --> 01:02:44.293
AFFILIATION WITH THE NFL TO SET

01:02:44.360 --> 01:02:46.295
UP A COMMISSION. TO LOOK EXACTLY

01:02:46.362 --> 01:02:48.397
AT THESE ISSUES IN RESPONSE TO

01:02:48.464 --> 01:02:50.533
THE VARIOUS LAWSUITS THAT THEY

01:02:50.600 --> 01:02:51.868
HAD EXPERIENCED THE O'BANNON

01:02:51.934 --> 01:02:52.902
LAWSUIT VARIOUS OTHERS.

01:02:52.969 --> 01:02:54.270
AND THEY SET UP THE CONDOLEEZZA

01:02:54.337 --> 01:02:56.405
RICE COMMISSION.

01:02:56.472 --> 01:02:57.773
THAT COMMISSION.

01:02:57.840 --> 01:02:58.908
RECOMMENDED THAT IN SITU A

01:02:58.975 --> 01:03:01.277
CHANGE THE RULES IN RECOMMENDED

01:03:01.344 --> 01:03:03.546
THAT STUDENTS HAVE THE RIGHT TO

01:03:03.613 --> 01:03:05.314
THEIR OWN IMAGE AND LIKENESS THE

01:03:05.381 --> 01:03:07.116
NC TWO EIGHT JUST DIDN'T EVEN

01:03:07.183 --> 01:03:08.618
WRITE REFERENCE BACK THEY NEVER

01:03:08.684 --> 01:03:09.619
SAID WELL.

01:03:09.685 --> 01:03:11.988
WE ACCEPT THESE RECOMMENDATIONS

01:03:12.054 --> 01:03:12.955
FOR KNOCKING ACT THE JUST.

01:03:13.022 --> 01:03:15.024
THEY NEVER RESPONDED THAT WAS

01:03:15.091 --> 01:03:19.195
ONLY LAST OCTOBER OR A YEAR AGO

01:03:19.262 --> 01:03:19.629
SO.

01:03:19.695 --> 01:03:21.397
SO AND I COULD CITE MANY

01:03:21.464 --> 01:03:24.867
ADDITIONAL INCIDENTS WHERE NC.

01:03:24.934 --> 01:03:26.002
TO EIGHT CHANGE THE RULES A

01:03:26.068 --> 01:03:28.704
LITTLE OR JUST IGNORED EVEN.

01:03:28.771 --> 01:03:30.606
TASK FORCES AND COMMISSIONS THAT

01:03:30.673 --> 01:03:32.275
THEY THEMSELVES SET UP.

01:03:32.341 --> 01:03:33.476
AND WE WANT TO LOOK AT SOME OF

01:03:33.543 --> 01:03:37.380
THE THE UNFAIRNESS OF THIS.

01:03:37.446 --> 01:03:38.848
TENNIS PLAYERS FOR EXAMPLE IN

01:03:38.915 --> 01:03:40.349
THE UNDER THE NC TWO EIGHT ARE

01:03:40.416 --> 01:03:42.485
ALLOWED TO TAKE HOME A TEN

01:03:42.552 --> 01:03:43.619
THOUSAND DOLLAR PURSE EACH YEAR

01:03:43.686 --> 01:03:43.920
[inaudible]

01:03:43.986 --> 01:03:46.055
NO OTHER.

01:03:46.122 --> 01:03:47.323
ATHLETE IS.

01:03:47.390 --> 01:03:48.991
EVEN THOUGH YOU MIGHT HAVE A

01:03:49.058 --> 01:03:50.660
WRESTLER FOR IT THANK.

01:03:50.726 --> 01:03:52.128
OR ANY OTHER STUDENT ATHLETES

01:03:52.195 --> 01:03:54.330
WHO MIGHT HAVE A SIMILAR ABILITY --

01:03:54.397 --> 01:03:56.165
TO PARTICIPATE IN A TOURNAMENT

01:03:56.232 --> 01:03:58.768
THAT GIVES A CASH AWARD BUT ONLY.

01:03:58.834 --> 01:04:00.536
THE TENNIS PLAYERS.

01:04:00.603 --> 01:04:02.538
D. BASKETBALL PLAYERS RECENTLY

01:04:02.605 --> 01:04:05.308
MEN BASKETBALL PLAYERS THE NC TO

01:04:05.374 --> 01:04:06.943
A IS NOW ALLOWING TO HAVE AN

01:04:07.009 --> 01:04:08.077
AGENT.

01:04:08.144 --> 01:04:10.646
ONLY MEANT WHAT HAPPENED A TITLE.

01:04:10.713 --> 01:04:12.515
NINE SO WE SEE THE NC TWO WAY

01:04:12.582 --> 01:04:14.784
WHEN THEY GET UNDER PRESSURE

01:04:14.850 --> 01:04:15.918
MAKE A LITTLE CHANGE.

01:04:15.985 --> 01:04:17.853
LET'S SEE IF THEY'RE SERIOUS IN

01:04:17.920 --> 01:04:19.455
THERE WILL MAKE A SUBSTANTIAL

01:04:19.522 --> 01:04:20.323
CHANGE.

01:04:20.389 --> 01:04:24.060
BUT FINALLY THE THREAT REGARDING.

01:04:24.126 --> 01:04:25.795
THAT WE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO

01:04:25.861 --> 01:04:29.165
PLAY IN CHAMPIONSHIPS.

01:04:29.232 --> 01:04:30.600
THE I WILL SPEAK FOR MY

01:04:30.666 --> 01:04:32.935
TECHNICAL EXPERT BUT MIGHT THE

01:04:33.002 --> 01:04:34.770
TECHNICAL EXPERT THAT I HAVE

01:04:34.837 --> 01:04:36.606
THAT THE TABLE.

01:04:36.672 --> 01:04:42.511
IS -- APOLOGIES FOR MY PAPER SIR

01:04:42.578 --> 01:04:48.884
FLOATING.

01:04:48.951 --> 01:04:50.686
OCT SKEWS ME MARC ALMOND WHO IS

01:04:50.753 --> 01:04:51.520
IN NEW YORK LAW PROFESSOR AND

01:04:51.587 --> 01:04:53.823
THE AUTHOR OF THE FORBES ARTICLE

01:04:53.889 --> 01:04:55.658
WHY THE NC TO A LIKELY CANNOT

01:04:55.725 --> 01:04:56.592
KEEP CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS. FOR ME

01:04:56.659 --> 01:04:57.493
THEIR CHAMPIONSHIPS OR FROM

01:04:57.560 --> 01:04:58.227
GIVING THIS RIGHT BECAUSE IT

01:04:58.294 --> 01:05:01.230
WOULD BE AN ANTI TRUST VIOLATION.

01:05:01.297 --> 01:05:02.765
AND THIS IS WHY NOW YOU SEE THE

01:05:02.832 --> 01:05:05.568
NC TO A HAS NOT THREATENED TO

01:05:05.635 --> 01:05:07.470
ELIMINATE CALIFORNIA COLLEGES

01:05:07.536 --> 01:05:09.472
FROM ANY PARTICIPATION ONLY FROM

01:05:09.538 --> 01:05:12.408
CHAMPIONSHIPS BECAUSE IT'S THAT

01:05:12.475 --> 01:05:14.543
IF YOU'RE A COLLEGE ATHLETE.

01:05:14.610 --> 01:05:16.245
TO THINK THAT YOU WOULD NOT BE

01:05:16.312 --> 01:05:18.681
ABLE TO PLACE CHAMPIONSHIPS IS

01:05:18.748 --> 01:05:22.418
QUITE IT YOU KNOW THAT.

01:05:22.485 --> 01:05:23.052
THERE REALLY WOULD BE WORRISOME

01:05:23.119 --> 01:05:24.420
TO A STUDENT BUT THEY MADE THAT

01:05:24.487 --> 01:05:25.254
SORT OF MOST POTENT THREAT.

01:05:25.321 --> 01:05:27.056
BUT THEY DON'T REALLY HAVE THE

01:05:27.123 --> 01:05:28.958
LEGAL ABILITY TO DO SO BECAUSE

01:05:29.025 --> 01:05:30.359
IT WOULD BE AN ANTITRUST

01:05:30.426 --> 01:05:32.395
VIOLATION AND I WOULD REFER YOU

01:05:32.461 --> 01:05:33.896
TO THAT ARTICLE INTO A NUMBER OF

01:05:33.963 --> 01:05:35.564
OTHER ARTICLES NOW THAT HAVE

01:05:35.631 --> 01:05:38.401
BEEN WRITTEN BY LIKE TO ASK THE

01:05:38.467 --> 01:05:40.069
REPRESENT A FOR THE C..

01:05:40.136 --> 01:05:45.775
CSU -- WHAT WHAT'S WHAT'S THE

01:05:45.841 --> 01:05:47.877
BIG DEAL?

01:05:47.943 --> 01:05:49.412
IF WE HAVE A BILL THAT IS NOT

01:05:49.478 --> 01:05:52.615
GOING TO GO INTO EFFECT. FOR

01:05:52.682 --> 01:05:53.749
THREE YEARS [inaudible]

01:05:53.816 --> 01:05:57.853
AND WE CURRENTLY HAVE A PROCESS

01:05:57.920 --> 01:06:01.223
BY THE NC TWO WAY. TO TAKE A A A

01:06:01.290 --> 01:06:03.626
A GOOD AND SERIOUS.

01:06:03.693 --> 01:06:06.595
LOOK AT THIS OP I'M FINDING IT

01:06:06.662 --> 01:06:10.933
DIFFICULT TO BE SYMPATHETIC.

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:12.635
ARE OVER -- SORT OF THIS

01:06:12.702 --> 01:06:14.737
DOOMSDAY.

01:06:14.804 --> 01:06:17.873
CLAIM HERE BUT IT IS OF CONCERN

01:06:17.940 --> 01:06:19.241
TO ME IF.

01:06:19.308 --> 01:06:22.411
IT TURNS OUT TO BE REAL.

01:06:22.478 --> 01:06:24.180
SO IT IT IN AND CORRECT ME IF

01:06:24.246 --> 01:06:26.115
I'M WRONG IT SEEMS.

01:06:26.182 --> 01:06:27.883
THAT NOTHING WILL HAPPEN OVER A

01:06:27.950 --> 01:06:29.985
THREE YEAR PERIOD OF TIME EXCEPT

01:06:30.052 --> 01:06:31.654
WE WILL BE ABLE TO SEE.

01:06:31.721 --> 01:06:33.823
HOW SERIOUS THE NC TO A

01:06:33.889 --> 01:06:34.123
[inaudible]

01:06:34.190 --> 01:06:35.324
IS ABOUT [inaudible]

01:06:35.391 --> 01:06:38.561
FIXING THIS.

01:06:38.627 --> 01:06:39.428
YES I'M PLEASE.

01:06:39.495 --> 01:06:41.530
THERE IS AND IT'S A LITTLE BIT

01:06:41.597 --> 01:06:43.132
OF THE WEEDS IN MY NEW **** BUT

01:06:43.199 --> 01:06:45.334
IT'S ALREADY HAPPENING IT'S

01:06:45.401 --> 01:06:47.002
CALLED NEGATIVE RECRUITING SO

01:06:47.069 --> 01:06:50.806
WHAT COLLEGES ARE DOING -- AT

01:06:50.873 --> 01:06:51.941
THE COLLEGE LEVEL YOU RECRUITED

01:06:52.007 --> 01:06:53.342
THE HIGH SCHOOL LEVEL SO THAT

01:06:53.409 --> 01:06:55.177
THE CLASS OF TWENTY TWENTY THREE

01:06:55.244 --> 01:06:56.545
ARE ALREADY BEING CONTACTED. TO

01:06:56.612 --> 01:06:58.013
BE RECOVERABLE PROSPECTIVE

01:06:58.080 --> 01:06:59.548
STUDENT ATHLETES SO WE'RE

01:06:59.615 --> 01:07:01.317
TALKING ABOUT THOSE YOUNG MEN

01:07:01.384 --> 01:07:02.918

01:07:02.985 --> 01:07:04.453
BY THIS RULE.

01:07:04.520 --> 01:07:05.054
AND THE NEGATIVE RECRUITING

01:07:05.121 --> 01:07:06.455
COMES FROM COACHES AND WE'VE

01:07:06.522 --> 01:07:08.057

AGAIN WITH TWO WORLDS.

01:07:26.475 --> 01:07:28.644
THERE'S NO WAY FOR EXAMPLE IF

01:07:28.711 --> 01:07:30.479
REGGIE BUSH RIGHT NOW IS BEING

01:07:30.546 --> 01:07:32.815

KNOW ENDORSING TOYOTA.

01:07:46.462 --> 01:07:47.797
EVERY TIME REGGIE BUSH IS GONNA

01:07:47.863 --> 01:07:50.599
GO TO USC THOSE OUTSIDE SCHOOLS

01:07:50.666 --> 01:07:52.701

THERE'S THIRTEEN HUNDREDS --

01:07:53.736 --> 01:07:54.870
SCHOOLS THAT MAKE UP THE NC

01:07:54.937 --> 01:07:56.539
DOUBLE WAY CALIFORNIA IS THE

01:07:56.605 --> 01:07:58.307
DROP IN THE BUCKET IN TERMS OF

01:07:58.374 --> 01:08:00.609
THE MEMBERSHIP.

01:08:00.676 --> 01:08:02.244
SO TO TO TO SAY THAT CALIFORNIA

01:08:04.547 --> 01:08:06.449
GORILLA THAT JUST GONNA BURY ITS

01:08:06.515 --> 01:08:07.149
WAY THROUGH AND PUSH PEOPLE

01:08:07.216 --> 01:08:10.152
AROUND -- THAT'S NOT THE CASE I

01:08:10.219 --> 01:08:11.987
I WILL I WISH IT WAS.

01:08:12.054 --> 01:08:13.155
YOU KNOW PERSONALLY I THINK IT

01:08:13.222 --> 01:08:14.523
IF THAT WERE THE CASE WHY DO WE

01:08:14.590 --> 01:08:16.692
KEEP ADDING MORE AND MORE STATES

01:08:16.759 --> 01:08:17.726
TO THE BAND TRAVEL LIST.

01:08:17.793 --> 01:08:18.961
AND WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH THAT

01:08:19.028 --> 01:08:21.730
NOW WE WE CAN'T CONTRACT GAMES

01:08:21.797 --> 01:08:22.965
WITH CERTAIN STATES BECAUSE

WE'RE NOT ALLOWED TO TRAVEL

01:08:23.599 --> 01:08:24.133
THERE.

01:08:24.200 --> 01:08:26.001
SO IF WE WERE THESE LEADERS AND

01:08:26.068 --> 01:08:28.304
I WISH WE WERE I I WISH WE WERE

01:08:28.370 --> 01:08:29.638
I BELIEVE IN IT I BELIEVE.

01:08:29.705 --> 01:08:31.807
THAT THE STATES ARE PASSING

01:08:31.874 --> 01:08:33.142
DISCRIMINATORY LAWS.

01:08:33.209 --> 01:08:35.411

AUTHORS FOR PRESENTING THIS

01:10:24.353 --> 01:10:25.087
BOMBING OF A FOR IT TODAY I

01:10:25.154 --> 01:10:25.955
THINK THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF

01:10:26.021 --> 01:10:27.289
ISSUES THAT STILL NEED TO BE

01:10:27.356 --> 01:10:28.557
WORKED OUT I I KNOW THAT YOU'VE

01:10:28.624 --> 01:10:32.294
GOT DELAYED IMPLEMENTATION -- HI

01:10:32.361 --> 01:10:34.597
HEAR AND UNDERSTAND THE CONCERNS

01:10:34.663 --> 01:10:36.432
OF THE OPPOSITION BUT THIS IS A

01:10:36.498 --> 01:10:37.900
IS.

01:10:37.967 --> 01:10:39.668
AN ISSUE THAT I REMEMBER PEOPLE

01:10:39.735 --> 01:10:41.904
ON MY CAMPUS TALKING TO ME ABOUT

01:10:41.971 --> 01:10:44.840
BACK WHEN I WAS A STUDENT BACK

01:10:44.907 --> 01:10:46.208
IN THE LAST MILLENNIUM.

01:10:46.275 --> 01:10:47.977
I GUESS I'M TRYING TO MAKE

01:10:48.043 --> 01:10:48.611
MYSELF SOUND TOO OLD BUT I MEAN

01:10:48.677 --> 01:10:49.745
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT

01:10:49.812 --> 01:10:51.380
THIS FOR A LONG TIME.

01:10:51.447 --> 01:10:53.782
AND AND CA IS GONNA MOVE AS SLOW

01:10:53.849 --> 01:10:55.284
AS IT WANTS TO MOVE.

01:10:55.351 --> 01:10:57.953
AND AND IN IN A WAY THAT IS.

01:10:58.020 --> 01:10:59.588
UNEQUAL AS YOU'VE ALREADY

01:10:59.655 --> 01:11:01.557
DEMONSTRATED IN IN THE EXAMPLES

01:11:01.624 --> 01:11:02.491
THAT YOU'VE GIVEN AND THINGS

01:11:02.558 --> 01:11:04.660
THAT THEY'VE ALREADY ALLOWED --

01:11:04.727 --> 01:11:06.428
SO WHETHER THIS BILL ACTUALLY

01:11:06.495 --> 01:11:09.698
BECOMES LAW -- IS IS ALMOST

01:11:09.765 --> 01:11:11.333
SECONDARY TO TE FACT THAT WE

01:11:11.400 --> 01:11:13.002
NEED TO COAX THIS CONVERSATION

01:11:13.068 --> 01:11:14.069
FURTHER THAN IT'S EVER BEEN

01:11:26.482 --> 01:11:27.583
UC SYSTEM.

01:11:27.650 --> 01:11:28.751
I CAN UNDERSTAND THE THE

01:11:28.817 --> 01:11:30.019
CHALLENGES YOU FACE AN ARGUMENT

01:11:30.085 --> 01:11:32.087
ABOUT GETTING CAUGHT IN BETWEEN

THE YOU KNOW PER PERSON REALLY

01:11:33.622 --> 01:11:34.990
CALIFORNIA STATE LAW AND NC

01:11:35.057 --> 01:11:36.358
DOUBLE A BY LAWS.

01:11:36.425 --> 01:11:37.192
THE QUESTION I HAVE IS WHAT'S

01:11:37.259 --> 01:11:38.861
THE WHAT'S UNIVERSITIES POSITION

01:11:38.927 --> 01:11:43.365
ON THE CAR ROLE.

01:11:43.432 --> 01:11:44.867
THE COROLLA OF WHAT THE CURRENT

01:11:44.933 --> 01:11:46.602

THAT AGAIN WE KIND OF WENT AND

01:11:50.339 --> 01:11:51.306
TALKED ABOUT HOW WE'RE NOT

01:11:51.373 --> 01:11:53.375
OPPOSED TO THE CONVERSATION THAT

01:11:53.442 --> 01:11:54.009
WE'RE HAVING TODAY I THINK IT'S

01:11:54.076 --> 01:11:55.711
ONE THAT NEEDS TO BE HAPPENED I

01:11:55.778 --> 01:11:56.545
THINK THE BILL.

01:11:56.612 --> 01:11:57.680
CERTAINLY SERVE THAT PURPOSE I

01:11:57.746 --> 01:11:58.914
CAN'T SAYING GO ON A LIMB AND

01:11:58.981 --> 01:12:00.249
SAY WHAT THE UNIVERSE MUSICIAN

01:12:00.315 --> 01:12:02.117
BECAUSE I MOSTLY CHANNELING.

01:12:02.184 --> 01:12:03.385
THE CONCERNS FROM ALL THE

01:12:03.452 --> 01:12:03.986
DIFFERENT ATHLETIC DIRECTOR

01:12:04.053 --> 01:12:05.921
SMALL THE CAMPUSES SO I CAN'T GO

ON A LIMB AND SAY THAT BUT I DO

01:12:06.655 --> 01:12:07.956
THINK.

01:12:08.023 --> 01:12:08.590
THERE IS INTEREST IN THIS ISSUE

01:12:08.657 --> 01:12:11.460
AND I THINK -- YOU KNOW WE NEED

01:12:11.527 --> 01:12:12.528
TO TALK ABOUT IT MORE THAT'S

01:12:12.594 --> 01:12:13.629
KIND OF WHY MY TEST MY SUGGESTS

01:12:13.696 --> 01:12:15.197
THAT WE WAIT TO SEE I GET THAT

01:12:15.264 --> 01:12:16.632
IT'S AN UNSTABLE A WORKING GROUP

01:12:16.699 --> 01:12:17.800
BUT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.

01:12:17.866 --> 01:12:18.901
A WORKING GROUP THAT'S GOING TO

01:12:18.967 --> 01:12:20.402
HAVE YOU KNOW PRESIDENT OF THE

01:12:20.469 --> 01:12:22.671
BIGGEST UNIVERSITIES EIGHTIES

01:12:22.738 --> 01:12:24.239
FROM THE SMALLEST UNIVERSITIES

01:12:24.306 --> 01:12:25.874
DO NAPPIES FROM THE THREE AND D.

01:12:25.941 --> 01:12:26.375
TO ANTI.

01:12:26.442 --> 01:12:27.142
ONE AND THEN WE CAN LOOK AT IT

01:12:27.209 --> 01:12:28.477
AS A STATE AND SAY WHAT DOES

01:12:28.544 --> 01:12:29.678
THIS SAY WHAT IT WHAT DOES IT

01:12:29.745 --> 01:12:30.946
MEAN YOU KNOW WE DON'T KNOW WE

01:12:31.013 --> 01:12:32.181
DON'T KNOW AND THAT'S THAT'S

01:12:32.247 --> 01:12:33.649
PART OF OUR FEARS THAT.

01:12:33.716 --> 01:12:37.786
WE JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT THIS

01:12:37.853 --> 01:12:38.287
LOOKS LIKE AND WHAT THE

01:12:38.353 --> 01:12:39.488
POTENTIAL.

TWENTY THREE WHATEVER THE BILL

01:12:42.991 --> 01:12:43.525
GETS INTO IMPLEMENTATION SO.

01:12:43.592 --> 01:12:44.193
I HOPE THAT AS YOUR QUESTION BUT

01:12:44.259 --> 01:12:45.094
I THINK THE CONCERN AGAIN IS

01:12:45.160 --> 01:12:46.929
THAT WERE KIND OF BEEN STUCK IN

01:12:46.995 --> 01:12:48.063
THE MIDDLE THIS WHOLE PROCESS

01:12:48.130 --> 01:12:49.064
AND WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO FIGURE

01:12:49.131 --> 01:12:51.834
OUT A WAY -- TO YOU KNOW MOVE

01:12:51.900 --> 01:12:54.303
FOR IN A PRODUCTIVE MANNER BUT

01:12:54.369 --> 01:12:56.638
IT JUST JUST HASN'T HAPPENED YET.

01:12:56.705 --> 01:12:57.272
THANK YOU FOR THAT I I WILL SAY

01:12:57.339 --> 01:12:59.508
AS A AS A AS A PROUD CAL LAMANNA

01:12:59.575 --> 01:13:00.809
IN A BIG CAL FOOTBALL FAN AND

01:13:00.876 --> 01:13:02.878
AND SOMEONE WHO CARES A LOT

01:13:02.945 --> 01:13:03.479
ABOUT.

01:13:03.545 --> 01:13:05.714
THE CSU SYSTEM IS PROUD TO

01:13:05.781 --> 01:13:07.816
PRESENT REPRESENTS THE SUN --

01:13:07.883 --> 01:13:08.884
YOU KNOW I WISH THAT THE THE THE

01:13:08.951 --> 01:13:12.488
CSU AND YOU SEE WOULD BE MORE.

01:13:12.554 --> 01:13:13.122
OUT FRONT ON THIS ISSUE I THINK

01:13:13.188 --> 01:13:13.989
THAT THE SYSTEM THAT CURRENTLY

01:13:14.056 --> 01:13:15.524
EXISTS IS DEEPLY EXPLICATE F.

01:13:15.591 --> 01:13:17.126
AND I THINK IT WOULD WRECK

01:13:17.192 --> 01:13:18.227
REFLECT REALLY REALLY WELL.

01:13:18.293 --> 01:13:19.394
ON BOTH OF THOSE SYSTEMS AS

01:13:19.461 --> 01:13:20.629
MEMBER INSTITUTIONS OF THE NC

01:13:20.696 --> 01:13:21.697
DOUBLE A TO SAY LISTEN WE THINK

01:13:21.764 --> 01:13:23.365
THAT THE CURRENT SYSTEM WE HAVE

01:13:23.432 --> 01:13:24.600
ISN'T FAIR AND TREATS ATHLETES

01:13:24.666 --> 01:13:26.068
ON FAIRLY AND THAT WE WANT TO BE

01:13:26.135 --> 01:13:27.469
PART OF MAKING POSITIVE CHANGE

01:13:27.536 --> 01:13:28.237
SO.

01:13:28.303 --> 01:13:29.138
I CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THAT

01:13:29.204 --> 01:13:30.773
THERE ARE AS AS THE WITNESS FROM

01:13:30.839 --> 01:13:32.040
LONG BEACH THEY POINT OUT SOME

01:13:32.107 --> 01:13:33.142
POTENTIAL DOWNSIDES TO THIS

01:13:33.208 --> 01:13:34.143
THERE CERTAINLY A LOT THAT WE

01:13:34.209 --> 01:13:35.611
DON'T KNOW I UNDERSTAND THOSE

01:13:35.677 --> 01:13:37.079
CONFLICTS BUT I HAVE TO WEIGH.

01:13:37.146 --> 01:13:38.981
THOSE POTENTIAL DOWNSIDES WHICH

01:13:39.047 --> 01:13:40.983
ARE UNKNOWN POTENTIAL CONFLICTS

01:13:41.049 --> 01:13:42.618
IN THE FUTURE WITH THE DOWNSIDE

01:13:42.684 --> 01:13:43.719
TO THE CURRENT SYSTEM AND THE

01:13:43.786 --> 01:13:45.287
CURRENT SYSTEM AS I SAID I THINK

01:13:45.354 --> 01:13:46.688
IS DEEPLY EXPLICATED -- IT'S

01:13:46.755 --> 01:13:47.923
PARTICULAR EXPLOITATIVE OF

01:13:47.990 --> 01:13:49.291
PEOPLE OF COLOR AND I THINK IT'S

01:13:49.358 --> 01:13:50.793
VERY APPROPRIATE FOR CALIFORNIA

01:13:50.859 --> 01:13:51.927
TO WEIGH IN HERE TO WEIGH IN

01:13:51.994 --> 01:13:53.262
WITH OUR VALUES TO TRY PUSHING

01:13:53.328 --> 01:13:55.931
CHANGE I COMMEND THE AUTHORS FOR

01:13:55.998 --> 01:13:56.899
THE SYSTEM THAT THEY'VE SET UP

01:13:56.965 --> 01:13:57.332
THEY'VE DELAYED THE

01:13:57.399 --> 01:13:59.601
IMPLEMENTATION. FOR A LONG TIME

01:13:59.668 --> 01:14:01.470
SO WE CAN SEE THEY REALLY GIVEN

01:14:01.537 --> 01:14:02.538
THE NC DOUBLE A TIME TO WORK

01:14:02.604 --> 01:14:04.106
THIS OUT WE HAVE A LOT OF

01:14:04.173 --> 01:14:05.374
OPPORTUNITIES TO SEE THAT.

01:14:05.440 --> 01:14:06.975
OUR PROCESS COME TO FRUITION IF

01:14:07.042 --> 01:14:08.210
IT IF THE IF THE NC DOUBLE A

01:14:08.277 --> 01:14:09.711
DOES THE RIGHT THING -- THEN WE

01:14:09.778 --> 01:14:10.813
HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO CHANGE

01:14:10.879 --> 01:14:12.214
CALIFORNIA LAW TO CONFORM

01:14:12.281 --> 01:14:14.349
WITHOUT TO RECOGNIZE THAT BUT IT

01:14:14.416 --> 01:14:15.651
APPROPRIATELY PLACES A TIME LINE

01:14:15.717 --> 01:14:17.152
ON THAT AND MAKE SURE THAT THEY

01:14:17.219 --> 01:14:18.587

ATHLETE I AM IN THE NCAA AND

01:17:53.935 --> 01:17:55.637
DURING MY TIME IN HIGH SCHOOL --

01:17:55.704 --> 01:17:57.773
I WAS APPROACHED FOR YOU KNOW

01:17:57.839 --> 01:17:59.508
SMALL SUNGLASSES DEALS BUT GOOD

01:17:59.574 --> 01:18:00.375
SUNGLASSES THAT PROTECT YOUR

01:18:00.442 --> 01:18:02.277
EYES ARE LIKE TWO HUNDRED

01:18:02.344 --> 01:18:03.645
DOLLARS AND A PAIR FREE

01:18:03.712 --> 01:18:04.780
SUNGLASSES WOULD HAVE MADE A

01:18:04.846 --> 01:18:06.048
DIFFERENCE YOU KNOW AND AND THEN

01:18:06.114 --> 01:18:07.983
THERE WAS ALSO A TV SHOW THAT

01:18:08.050 --> 01:18:09.151
THEY WANTED TO DO.

01:18:09.217 --> 01:18:10.719

WITHOUT HAVING REPRESENTATION

01:18:17.426 --> 01:18:17.993

WHETHER OR NOT I WOULD HAVE DONE

01:18:21.029 --> 01:18:22.431
THE TV SHOW THE POINT WAS I

01:18:22.497 --> 01:18:23.432
DIDN'T EVEN HAVE A RIGHT TO AN

01:18:23.498 --> 01:18:26.268
AGENT -- AND SO. FOR SOME PEOPLE

01:18:26.334 --> 01:18:27.602
THIS COULD BE AS SIMPLE AS

01:18:27.669 --> 01:18:29.638
GETTING A FREE MEAL EVERY ONCE

01:18:29.704 --> 01:18:30.238
IN AWHILE FROM A WELL MEANING

01:18:30.305 --> 01:18:32.240
FAN -- AND FOR OTHERS IT COULD

01:18:32.307 --> 01:18:33.975
MEAN A LOT MORE -- BUT IT'S

01:18:34.042 --> 01:18:35.077
REALLY JUST THE RIGHT TO HAVING

01:18:35.143 --> 01:18:37.813
THE ABILITY TO MARKET YOURSELF I

01:18:37.879 --> 01:18:38.613
KNOW IT'S PRETTY COMMON FOR

01:18:38.680 --> 01:18:39.748
OTHER VITAL PLAYERS OF YOUR

01:18:39.815 --> 01:18:41.550

THERE IS THE CONCEPT AGAIN OF

01:19:20.655 --> 01:19:21.923
AMATEURISM.

DECIDED THAT HE WANTED GO TO

01:19:34.336 --> 01:19:35.437
COLLEGE.

01:19:35.504 --> 01:19:36.838
HE WANTED TO BE AN AMATEUR.

01:19:36.905 --> 01:19:38.707
HE DID HAVE THE OPTION TO TURN

01:19:38.773 --> 01:19:41.676

01:22:52.734 --> 01:22:53.435
MORE THAN TEN YEARS AS AN

TWENTY LAW REVIEW ARTICLES I'VE

01:22:59.874 --> 01:23:02.711
WRITTEN AND PUBLISHED ON ANTI

TRUST AND THE NC DOUBLE I MY

01:23:04.612 --> 01:23:06.548
POSITION AS WELL THE NC DOUBLE A

01:23:06.614 --> 01:23:07.682
HAS INDEED.

01:23:07.749 --> 01:23:09.617
MADE THE THREAT THE BAND SCHOOLS

01:23:09.684 --> 01:23:12.220
THAT ALLOW ATHLETES TO SIGN DOOR

01:23:12.287 --> 01:23:13.088
SMITH DEALS.

01:23:13.154 --> 01:23:15.790
ARE MUCH AS IT'S CORRECT.

01:23:15.857 --> 01:23:17.359
THAT A COLLEGE AT THE FALL THE

01:23:17.425 --> 01:23:19.160
NC DOUBLE A IS RULES THE NC

01:23:19.227 --> 01:23:20.462
DOUBLE A ALSO HAVE TO FOLLOW THE

01:23:20.528 --> 01:23:22.297
LAW OF THE LAND AND THAT

01:23:22.364 --> 01:23:23.898
INCLUDES SECTION ONE OF THE

01:23:23.965 --> 01:23:25.633
SHERMAN ACT.

01:23:25.700 --> 01:23:26.801
WHICH IS ANTI TRUST LAW.

01:23:26.868 --> 01:23:28.136
THE NC DOUBLE A IS MADE UP OF

01:23:28.203 --> 01:23:29.938
MORE THAN TWELVE HUNDRED MEMBER

01:23:30.004 --> 01:23:31.406
SCHOOLS WHICH GIVES THEM A

01:23:31.473 --> 01:23:33.742
MONOPOLY OVER COLLEGE ATHLETICS.

01:23:33.808 --> 01:23:35.643
WHEN THESE TWELVE HUNDRED MEMBER

01:23:35.710 --> 01:23:37.712
SCHOOLS COME TOGETHER AND PASS A

01:23:37.779 --> 01:23:41.082
RULE THAT SAYS NO MEMBER SCHOOL

01:23:41.149 --> 01:23:44.152
MAY COMPENSATE OR ALLOW ANY

01:23:44.219 --> 01:23:45.520
ATHLETE THE COULD MAKE MONEY?

01:23:45.587 --> 01:23:47.322
ON THEIR OWN NAME AND LIKENESS

01:23:47.389 --> 01:23:48.390
THAT WOULD AMOUNT TO WHAT'S

01:23:48.456 --> 01:23:50.558
CONSIDERED BOTH WAGE FIXING AND

01:23:50.625 --> 01:23:52.193
A GROUP BOYCOTT ALTERNATIVELY

01:23:52.260 --> 01:23:53.962
KNOWN AS A CONCERTED REFUSAL TO

01:23:54.028 --> 01:23:54.629
DEAL.

01:23:54.696 --> 01:23:57.031
BOTH WOULD BE PROBLEMATIC UNDER

01:23:57.098 --> 01:23:58.233
SECTION ONE OF THE SHERMAN ACT.

01:23:58.299 --> 01:24:00.268
TWO RECENT CASES THE JENKINS

01:24:00.335 --> 01:24:01.636
CASE IN THE BANNING CASE PAUL

01:24:01.703 --> 01:24:02.971
FROM THE NINTH CIRCUIT.

01:24:03.037 --> 01:24:04.672
AS WELL AS THE SUPREME COURT

01:24:04.739 --> 01:24:06.674
DECISION IN NC DOUBLE A VERSE

01:24:06.741 --> 01:24:07.842
BOARD OF REGENTS.

01:24:07.909 --> 01:24:09.377
HOLD AT THE NC DOUBLE A IS

01:24:09.444 --> 01:24:11.946
INDEED SUBJECT TO ANTITRUST LAW.

01:24:12.013 --> 01:24:13.548
AND IT'S MY OPINION THAT FAR

01:24:13.615 --> 01:24:15.016
MORE LIKELY THAN NOT IF THEY

01:24:15.083 --> 01:24:16.684
ENACTED THIS RESTRAINT IT WOULD

01:24:16.751 --> 01:24:19.421
DEEM TO BE ILLEGAL UNDER OUR

01:24:19.487 --> 01:24:20.922
ANTI TRUST LAWS.

01:24:20.989 --> 01:24:24.692
THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- MR OF

01:24:24.759 --> 01:24:26.728
CONTORT MY SENATOR HERE FROM

FROM LOS ANGELES OF YOU ARE YOU

01:24:29.431 --> 01:24:30.899
SAY THIS IS NOT REALLY AN ISSUE

01:24:30.965 --> 01:24:33.034
OF MAKING MILLIONS.

01:24:33.101 --> 01:24:35.837
BUT IT REALLY IS IT'S JUST WHO'S

01:24:35.904 --> 01:24:38.173
GETTING -- MILLION WALLS BILLION

01:24:38.239 --> 01:24:38.606
FOR THEM.

01:24:38.673 --> 01:24:39.741
THAT'S WHAT I'D LIKE TO SAY THAT

01:24:39.808 --> 01:24:40.975
THIS IS A BIG BIG MONEY.

01:24:41.042 --> 01:24:41.543
AND WE SEEM RULES THAT HAVE

01:24:41.609 --> 01:24:42.811
CHANGED IN ORDER TO GET BIG

01:24:42.877 --> 01:24:43.578
MONEY.

01:24:43.645 --> 01:24:45.246
I MEAN THE FACT THAT WE ARE A

01:24:45.313 --> 01:24:46.881
DEMANDING THAT DOGS STUDENTS

01:24:46.948 --> 01:24:48.716
CAN'T PLAY STRAIGHT OUT OF HIGH

01:24:48.783 --> 01:24:49.818
SCHOOL IN CERTAIN SPORTS

01:24:49.884 --> 01:24:50.652
PARTICULARLY.

01:24:50.718 --> 01:24:52.921
OF IS ONCE AGAIN NOT ABOUT THE

01:24:52.987 --> 01:24:53.855
NEED OF THE STUDENTS REALLY

01:24:53.922 --> 01:24:55.223
ABOUT THE NEED OF THE SPORT IN

01:24:55.290 --> 01:24:57.258
ORDER TO KEEP THESE FOLKS THESE

01:24:57.325 --> 01:24:58.960
CAMPUSES COMPETITIVE I GATHER.

01:24:59.027 --> 01:25:00.695
THAT'S THERE AND YOU KNOW HAVING

01:25:00.762 --> 01:25:01.930
BEEN THE PROFESSOR OF KAWHI

01:25:01.996 --> 01:25:03.898
LEONARD AND KNOWING THAT HE'S

01:25:03.965 --> 01:25:05.567
YEAR THAT HE SPENT IT'S AN EAGLE

01:25:05.633 --> 01:25:05.867
STATE THAT.

01:25:05.934 --> 01:25:07.569
BECAME TWO YEARS WAS NOT

01:25:07.635 --> 01:25:08.169
SOMETHING HE WOULD HAVE EVER

01:25:08.236 --> 01:25:11.206
WANTED TO DO -- AND THE SAME IS

01:25:11.272 --> 01:25:12.474
TRUE WITH DIANA AND SO AS I LOOK

01:25:12.540 --> 01:25:13.641
AT THIS AND I'M THINKING IS THIS

01:25:13.708 --> 01:25:15.510
IS THE BEST INTEREST OF STUDENTS

01:25:15.577 --> 01:25:16.945
KNOWS IN INVEST INTEREST OF

01:25:17.011 --> 01:25:18.213
UNIVERSITY IN MAKING MONEY YES.

01:25:18.279 --> 01:25:19.481
IT IS IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF

01:25:19.547 --> 01:25:21.716
ACADEMICS NO -- BECAUSE THOSE OF

01:25:21.783 --> 01:25:22.917
THAT'S NOT THE FOCUS OF A IT'S A

01:25:22.984 --> 01:25:24.385
REALLY ABOUT MAKING LOTS OF

01:25:24.452 --> 01:25:26.488
MONEY AND THE AND AS I LISTEN TO

01:25:26.554 --> 01:25:27.722
THESE RULES.

01:25:27.789 --> 01:25:29.924
A PARTICULARLY THE THE THE THE

01:25:29.991 --> 01:25:31.526
THE ISSUES OF WHAT YOU CAN'T DO

01:25:31.593 --> 01:25:32.894
BEGINNING IN HIGH SCHOOL AND

01:25:32.961 --> 01:25:34.429
I'VE HAD SOME STUDENTS WHO WERE.

01:25:34.496 --> 01:25:35.897
SOMEHOW ANOTHER VIçT SOMETHING

01:25:35.964 --> 01:25:37.031
IN HIGH SCHOOL BECAME VERY BIG

01:25:37.098 --> 01:25:38.299
BECAUSE THEY ACCEPTED SOMETHING

01:25:38.366 --> 01:25:39.100
THAT THEY DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING

01:25:39.167 --> 01:25:39.634
ABOUT IT YET.

01:25:39.701 --> 01:25:41.102
THEY'RE BEING HELD ACCOUNTABLE

01:25:41.169 --> 01:25:43.137
TO THESE RULES IS IF YOU OWN

01:25:43.204 --> 01:25:43.838
THESE PEOPLE.

01:25:43.905 --> 01:25:45.473
AND OBVIOUSLY BEING AFRICAN

01:25:45.540 --> 01:25:47.809
AMERICAN OWNING PEOPLE IS NOT

01:25:47.876 --> 01:25:51.312
SOMETHING I'M REALLY -- IN FAVOR

01:25:51.379 --> 01:25:54.749
OF HAVING US SURVIVED A BITE

01:25:54.816 --> 01:25:56.918
ANSWERS TO SLAVERY IF THIS I'VE

01:25:56.985 --> 01:25:57.819
ALWAYS FELT.

01:25:57.886 --> 01:26:00.788
THIS WHOLE GAME THINGS LIKE BIG

01:26:00.855 --> 01:26:01.122
SLAVE SYSTEM.

01:26:01.189 --> 01:26:02.423
THAT OF THAT ROUTE DOESN'T ALLOW

01:26:02.490 --> 01:26:09.597
YOU TO ACTUALIZE PLAY THE SPORT.

01:26:09.664 --> 01:26:11.533
OF THE VERY SPORTS AND HE GOT

01:26:11.599 --> 01:26:13.001
VERY LITTLE OUT OF IT.

01:26:13.067 --> 01:26:14.669
MOST OF MY STUDENTS ALMOST LIVE

01:26:14.736 --> 01:26:16.971
IN POVERTY WHILE THEY WERE ON

01:26:17.038 --> 01:26:18.273
CAMPUS AS IT WERE COULDN'T EVEN

01:26:18.339 --> 01:26:19.574
GET SOMEONE COULD GET FINANCIAL

01:26:19.641 --> 01:26:20.875
AID THAT DIDN'T GET ADEQUATE

01:26:20.942 --> 01:26:21.543
SCHOLARSHIP.

01:26:21.609 --> 01:26:23.144
THEY COULD WORK IN THE SUMMER

01:26:23.211 --> 01:26:23.912
THEY COULD WORK IN THE EVENINGS

01:26:23.978 --> 01:26:25.713
THAT YOU KNOW AND THEY THEY JUST

01:26:25.780 --> 01:26:27.215
USED EVERY MOMENT OF THEM.

01:26:27.282 --> 01:26:29.384
IN ORDER -- TO PLAY THE SPORT

01:26:29.450 --> 01:26:30.451
AND YET THEY WOULD NOT ABLE TO

01:26:30.518 --> 01:26:32.487
MARKET THEMSELVES IN ANY KIND OF

01:26:32.554 --> 01:26:33.888
MANNER IN ANY FASHION.

01:26:33.955 --> 01:26:35.924
AND AND MANY OF THEM WERE NOT

01:26:35.990 --> 01:26:37.792
GOING PRO SO THIS WAS A A TIME

01:26:37.859 --> 01:26:39.260
IN THEIR LIFE WHEN THEY COULD

01:26:39.327 --> 01:26:40.161
HAVE DONE SOMETHING AND THEN TO

01:26:40.228 --> 01:26:40.929
SEE.

01:26:40.995 --> 01:26:42.130
IN THE END THAT OUR UNIVERSITIES

01:26:42.196 --> 01:26:43.398
WERE MAKING MORE AND MORE AND

01:26:43.464 --> 01:26:45.700
MORE BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY THE FOCUS

01:26:45.767 --> 01:26:47.702
IS IS IS GETTING ON TV AND

01:26:47.769 --> 01:26:49.003
DRIVING EVERYTHING ELSE AND

01:26:49.070 --> 01:26:50.038
MAKING.

01:26:50.104 --> 01:26:51.606
MORE MONEY AND MORE MONEY AND

01:26:51.673 --> 01:26:53.341
AND I MOST FACULTY ON CAMPUS

01:26:53.408 --> 01:26:54.442
EVERY YEAR THERE WAS ALWAYS A

01:26:54.509 --> 01:26:56.077
PROTEST OR EIGHT EFFORT TO

01:26:56.144 --> 01:26:57.111
ELIMINATE SPORTS AT SAN DIEGO

01:26:57.178 --> 01:26:58.613
STATE -- BECAUSE OF THE

01:26:58.680 --> 01:27:00.081
TREMENDOUS MONEY THAT WAS COMING

01:27:00.148 --> 01:27:01.149
INTO THE CAMPUS IS THAT WOULD

01:27:01.215 --> 01:27:02.517
NOT BENEFITING STUDENTS.

01:27:02.584 --> 01:27:04.752
OF THE HUGE SALARIES OF FACULTY

01:27:04.819 --> 01:27:05.920
BEPPO THAT NOT FACULTY BUT

01:27:05.987 --> 01:27:07.488
CULTURES WERE MAKING FAR ABOVE

01:27:07.555 --> 01:27:09.424
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNIVERSITY

01:27:09.490 --> 01:27:10.825
OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO THE

01:27:10.892 --> 01:27:12.594
CULTURES WHO RAN THE VERY SPORTS

01:27:12.660 --> 01:27:15.229
AND IT'S JUST A HUGE MACHINE OF

01:27:15.296 --> 01:27:16.297
ITSELF.

01:27:16.364 --> 01:27:17.498
AND IN THE END WHEN I LOOK AT IT

01:27:17.565 --> 01:27:18.633
MOST OF MY STUDENTS AND BENEFIT

01:27:18.700 --> 01:27:19.200
FROM IT.

01:27:19.267 --> 01:27:20.735
I PROBABLY HAD TO STUDENTS IN

01:27:20.802 --> 01:27:22.203
ALL THE TIME HAVE BEEN IN WHO

01:27:22.270 --> 01:27:24.706
REALLY BEEN REALLY SEARS PRO.

01:27:24.772 --> 01:27:33.514
YOU KNOW AND YOU KNOW FOOTBALL

01:27:33.581 --> 01:27:35.550
OF THE FOOTBALL PLAYER I MEAN

01:27:35.617 --> 01:27:36.684
BASKETBALL C<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt; ISLAND IT OF&lt;/c&gt;</u>

01:27:36.751 --> 01:27:36.918
COURSE.

01:27:36.985 --> 01:27:40.288
AND BLOCKING ON POINTED TOE AND

01:27:40.355 --> 01:27:41.756
TONY GWYNN BASEBALL -- BEYOND

01:27:41.823 --> 01:27:44.092
THAT THAT'S A FORTY YEAR HISTORY

01:27:44.158 --> 01:27:45.793
OKAY THEN.

01:27:45.860 --> 01:27:47.228
IF YOU WANTED -- TO SOMEWHERE

01:27:47.295 --> 01:27:48.763
BUT YEAH BUT NOT REALLY SERIOUS

01:27:48.830 --> 01:27:50.164
MONEY I MEAN YOU KNOW LIKE THOSE

01:27:50.231 --> 01:27:50.531
TO THE ITSELF.

01:27:50.598 --> 01:27:51.532
SO WHEN I BEGIN TO ASK MYSELF

01:27:51.599 --> 01:27:52.367
THIS QUESTION AND WHEN IT WAS

01:27:52.433 --> 01:27:53.501
BROUGHT TO ME I I SAID TO MYSELF

01:27:53.568 --> 01:27:54.869
YOU KNOW WHO'S MAKING THE MONEY

01:27:54.936 --> 01:27:55.970
ON THIS AND WE SEE IT EVERY DAY --

01:27:56.037 --> 01:27:56.604
WE SEE IT IN SMALL WAYS AND IN

01:27:56.671 --> 01:27:58.339
LARGE WAYS THIS CAMPUS CALCULATE

01:27:58.406 --> 01:27:58.940
HOW MUCH THEY CAN MAKE ON THE

01:27:59.007 --> 01:27:59.207
STUDENTS.

01:27:59.273 --> 01:27:59.807
AND KNOWING THAT THE STUDENTS

01:27:59.874 --> 01:28:00.708
WILL BENEFIT VERY LITTLE WHILE

01:28:00.775 --> 01:28:02.110
THE BEER WHAT THE WHAT THE

01:28:02.176 --> 01:28:03.378
PROMISE ALWAYS IF THEY WILL GO

01:28:03.444 --> 01:28:04.012
PRO.

01:28:04.078 --> 01:28:05.680
AND AND MANY OF THEM BELIEVE

01:28:05.747 --> 01:28:06.714
THAT KNOWING THAT THEY DON'T

01:28:06.781 --> 01:28:07.849
HAVE REALLY THE ABILITY IN A

01:28:07.915 --> 01:28:09.984
COMPETITIVE LEVEL TO ACTUALLY GO

01:28:10.051 --> 01:28:11.452
PRO -- I'VE SEEN SOME OF THE

01:28:11.519 --> 01:28:12.720
WORST THINGS IN TERMS OF THAT

01:28:12.787 --> 01:28:14.022
HAPPENED IN ATHLETICS I REALLY

01:28:14.088 --> 01:28:15.323
HAVE AS A PROFESSOR.

01:28:15.390 --> 01:28:17.792
OF ABUSE OF STUDENTS IN WAYS

01:28:17.859 --> 01:28:19.427
THAT ONE COULD NOT IMAGINE AND

01:28:19.494 --> 01:28:20.795
EVENTUALLY YOU COUPLE COACHES

01:28:20.862 --> 01:28:22.497
WHO GOT -- KICKED OUT AND

01:28:22.563 --> 01:28:24.165
STUDENT WHAT HAVE YOU BUT IN SEE

01:28:24.232 --> 01:28:25.600
TO A COVER UP A LOT OF STUFF.

01:28:25.667 --> 01:28:27.068
AND SO I JUST FIND IT APPALLING

01:28:27.135 --> 01:28:28.036
WHEN I READ AND SAID THAT THEY

01:28:28.102 --> 01:28:29.537
WILL BE THE EFFORT WOULD BE TO

01:28:29.604 --> 01:28:30.838
MAKE SURE THAT THE STUDENTS.

01:28:30.905 --> 01:28:31.973
A DID NOT PARTICIPATE ANYTHING

01:28:32.040 --> 01:28:33.941
ELSE -- AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO

01:28:34.008 --> 01:28:35.176
MAKE A DECISION ABOUT THEIR

01:28:35.243 --> 01:28:37.245
LIVES BASED ON WHAT SCHOOL ARE

01:28:37.311 --> 01:28:38.713
GOING TO GO TO IN WHO'S GOING TO

01:28:38.780 --> 01:28:39.347
BE THE AND WHO'S NOT GOING TO BE

01:28:39.414 --> 01:28:40.048
THERE AND WHAT MONEY IS GOING TO

01:28:40.114 --> 01:28:41.249
BE THE AND ALL THAT OTHER KIND

01:28:41.315 --> 01:28:42.750
OF STUFF BUT IT REALLY.

01:28:42.817 --> 01:28:44.185
IS ABOUT THE PROTECTION AND SEE

01:28:44.252 --> 01:28:45.086
TO IT AND PROTECTION OF CAMPUSES

01:28:45.153 --> 01:28:46.254
AND THEIR ABILITY TO MAKE A LOTS

01:28:46.320 --> 01:28:47.822
AND LOTS OF MONEY ON THE

01:28:47.889 --> 01:28:48.489
STUDENTS.

01:28:48.556 --> 01:28:50.124
AND THE AND THE STUDENTS TO

01:28:50.191 --> 01:28:52.927
BENEFIT MOST OF THEM VERY LITTLE

01:28:52.994 --> 01:28:54.796
FROM BEING COLLEGE ATHLETES YOU

01:28:54.862 --> 01:28:56.330
KNOW MOST ATHLETES I KNOW NOW

01:28:56.397 --> 01:28:58.266
DID NOT MAKE ANY MONEY AS A

01:28:58.332 --> 01:28:59.133
RESULT OF BEING AN ATHLETE THAT

01:28:59.200 --> 01:29:00.935
HAVE BENEFITTED VERY LITTLE.

01:29:01.002 --> 01:29:04.205
IN THE PROCESS -- AND COULD THEY

01:29:04.272 --> 01:29:05.540
HAVE DONE SOMEONE ELSE MAKES A

01:29:05.606 --> 01:29:06.574
LITTLE BIT MORE MONEY MAYBE THEY

01:29:06.641 --> 01:29:07.575
COULD HAVE.

01:29:07.642 --> 01:29:18.453
BUT THE BUT THE RESTRICTION IS

01:29:18.519 --> 01:29:20.188
SAYS YOU CAN'T DO IT.

01:29:20.254 --> 01:29:20.888
IS WHAT I FIND TO BE HONEST MORE

01:29:20.955 --> 01:29:21.923
THAN ANYTHING ELSE THE INABILITY

01:29:21.989 --> 01:29:23.758
TO USE MY TALENT MY SKILL TO

01:29:23.825 --> 01:29:24.559
MARKET MYSELF FOR MYSELF.

01:29:24.625 --> 01:29:25.893
A WHILE OTHER TO DOING THAT IS

01:29:25.960 --> 01:29:26.861
IS TO ME STILL AN UNACCEPTABLE

01:29:26.928 --> 01:29:27.862
AND UP SO I'LL BE SUPPORTING

01:29:27.929 --> 01:29:28.863
THIS BILL AND HOPEFULLY IN THE

01:29:28.930 --> 01:29:29.297
TIME FRAME.

01:29:29.363 --> 01:29:30.431
INTO TO A WILL SOMETIMES LOOK AT

01:29:30.498 --> 01:29:31.632
ITSELF THIS CONVERSATION IS I

01:29:31.699 --> 01:29:32.567
WOULD SAY PROBABLY OLDER THAN I

01:29:32.633 --> 01:29:33.935
AM BUT IT'S NOT BECAUSE ONLY THE

01:29:34.001 --> 01:29:34.635
LAST BY FIFTY SIXTY YEARS.

01:29:34.702 --> 01:29:35.737
THAT WE REALLY BEEN RAKING IN

01:29:35.803 --> 01:29:36.337
THE MONEY ON STUDENTS OF THAT

01:29:36.404 --> 01:29:37.772
I'VE SEEN BUT IT IS AN OLD

01:29:37.839 --> 01:29:39.807
CONVERSATION REALLY OLD OF THAT

01:29:39.874 --> 01:29:40.942
PEOPLE TALK ABOUT IF

01:29:41.008 --> 01:29:42.610
UNIVERSITIES PEOPLE TALK ABOUT.

01:29:42.677 --> 01:29:44.645
IN COMMUNITIES ALL THE TIME IS

01:29:44.712 --> 01:29:45.913
WHY CAN'T THE STUDENTS WHO OUT

THERE WORKING I MEAN IT

01:29:47.615 --> 01:29:49.117
LITERALLY WORKING BECAUSE YOU

01:29:49.183 --> 01:29:50.585

MORNING SAN DIEGO STATE.

01:29:57.558 --> 01:29:59.060
GO TO CLASS AND COME BACK AND

01:29:59.127 --> 01:30:00.161

SWIM CLOSE TO SIX TO SEVEN

01:30:01.929 --> 01:30:04.732
O'CLOCK AT NIGHT -- AND AND AND

01:30:04.799 --> 01:30:06.534
GET VERY LITTLE OUT OF IT. ONE

01:30:06.601 --> 01:30:07.602
OF MY STUDENTS AT LESS THAN A

01:30:07.668 --> 01:30:09.437
SEMESTER HAD MESSED UP ALL OF

01:30:09.504 --> 01:30:11.105
HER MUSCLES IN HER LAKE AND

01:30:11.172 --> 01:30:13.441
COULD NO LONGER SWIM AFTER AFTER

01:30:13.508 --> 01:30:15.243
ONE SEMESTER IT'S AN EAGLE STATE.

01:30:15.309 --> 01:30:16.177
AND SHE HAD NEVER TO TALK ABOUT

01:30:16.244 --> 01:30:18.112
THE DIFFICULTY IN THE TASK OF

01:30:18.179 --> 01:30:19.747
THE HARD WORK THAT WAS THERE --

01:30:19.814 --> 01:30:21.883
AND IT'S A HARD JOB IT'S A HARD

01:30:21.949 --> 01:30:24.218
JOB BEING AN ATHLETE AND IF YOU

01:30:24.285 --> 01:30:25.853
YET AND AND AND THE DEMANDS ARE

01:30:25.920 --> 01:30:26.420
GREAT.

01:30:26.487 --> 01:30:27.622
NOT ONLY DO IN THE SEASON WHEN

01:30:27.688 --> 01:30:29.290
YOU'RE DOING WITH OFF SEASON AND

01:30:29.357 --> 01:30:30.691
SUMMER AS WELL AND IS VERY LOW

01:30:30.758 --> 01:30:32.560
COMPENSATION THAT COMES TO THOSE

01:30:32.627 --> 01:30:40.067
STUDENTS AND A FEW BECOME FAMOUS.

01:30:40.134 --> 01:30:41.269
SO BE IT BUT THE REST OF THEM

01:30:41.335 --> 01:30:42.236
ALL THEY GIVE AN AWFUL LOT AND

01:30:42.303 --> 01:30:43.304
GET VERY LITTLE IN RETURN.

01:30:43.371 --> 01:30:44.305
AND I THINK IT'S TIME TO

01:30:44.372 --> 01:30:44.906
BASICALLY PUSHED THE AGENDA.

01:30:44.972 --> 01:30:47.842

THE THAT MAY WELL AND SU BY OUR

01:34:50.384 --> 01:34:54.121

SUCH A GOOD THING -- BUT I'M

01:34:59.660 --> 01:35:01.929
CONVINCED TODAY THAT NOTHING'S

01:35:01.996 --> 01:35:04.432
GOING TO CHANGE -- WITHOUT AT

01:35:04.498 --> 01:35:07.334
LEAST THE POTENTIAL FOR SOME --

01:35:07.401 --> 01:35:08.936
A FOR SOME A TERM OTHERS THAT

01:35:09.003 --> 01:35:11.472
OLD SAYING THAT NOTHING NOTHING

01:35:11.539 --> 01:35:11.972
GOOD EVER CAME WITHOUT A

AND SOMETHING HAS TO GIVE HERE I

01:35:17.178 --> 01:35:19.647
THINK THAT -- OF THOSE OF YOU

01:35:19.713 --> 01:35:21.248
WHO ARE HERE PARTICIPATING IN

THIS HEARING ARE ARE HEARING.

01:35:23.818 --> 01:35:25.886
A FROM AROUND THE DICE THE SENSE

01:35:25.953 --> 01:35:29.356
THAT -- THE STATUS QUO IS

01:35:29.423 --> 01:35:31.692
UNACCEPTABLE AND SOMETHING NEEDS

01:35:31.759 --> 01:35:33.227
TO CHANGE AND THERE'S A SENSE OF

01:35:33.294 --> 01:35:34.829
GREAT FRUSTRATION I THINK

01:35:34.895 --> 01:35:36.363
JUSTIFIABLY.

01:35:36.430 --> 01:35:37.631
BOB WITH THE FACT THAT THIS

01:35:37.698 --> 01:35:39.500
ISSUE'S BEEN PERCOLATING FOR

01:35:39.567 --> 01:35:41.068
QUITE SOME TIME NOW.

01:35:41.135 --> 01:35:45.106
AND VERY LITTLE HAS CHANGED.

01:35:45.172 --> 01:35:47.741
SO I'M GONNA ASK A CAST MIKE --

01:35:47.808 --> 01:35:53.314
I VOTE TODAY AS AS WELL -- AND

01:35:53.380 --> 01:35:54.882
HOPE THAT.

01:35:54.949 --> 01:35:58.786
THAT IS GOING TO HELP DRIVE --

01:35:58.853 --> 01:36:01.856
NOT MAYBE A PERHAPS NOT EXACTLY

01:36:01.922 --> 01:36:04.692
THE CHANGE THAT I THINK IS BEST --

THAT THE AUTHOR THINKS IS BEST --

01:36:06.794 --> 01:36:10.531
BUT THAT HELPS THE MOST PEOPLE

01:36:10.598 --> 01:36:13.300
WHO ARE -- REALLY I THINK THE

01:36:13.367 --> 01:36:15.336
PEOPLE THAT THE AUTHORS TRYING

01:36:15.402 --> 01:36:16.837
TO TO HELP HERE OF THE OF THOSE

01:36:16.904 --> 01:36:21.408

01:36:55.976 --> 01:36:59.079
RATHER THAN -- FROM MY

01:36:59.146 --> 01:37:01.182
PERSPECTIVE I THINK THERE'S

01:37:01.248 --> 01:37:04.952
WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW IS -- WHO

01:37:05.019 --> 01:37:07.221

HAD THE FEELING THAT I'M MIGHT

01:38:43.884 --> 01:38:46.020
HAVE BEEN ONE OF THE FEW NON

01:38:46.086 --> 01:38:47.721

CALIFORNIA.

01:39:03.470 --> 01:39:05.806
AT RIVERSIDE THAT WAS THEN

01:39:05.873 --> 01:39:07.708

YEAR I GRADUATED.

01:39:15.783 --> 01:39:16.950
AND AND CERTAINLY WAS NOT THE

01:39:17.017 --> 01:39:22.089
SAME -- EXPERIENCE AS A AS A BIG

01:39:22.156 --> 01:39:24.658
TEN UNIVERSITY OF THAT PRODUCE

01:39:24.725 --> 01:39:26.927
AS BOTH WERE VERY VALUABLE BUT

01:39:26.994 --> 01:39:27.728
BOTH.

01:39:27.795 --> 01:39:30.030
WERE VERY DIFFERENT AND AND TO

01:39:30.097 --> 01:39:32.499
DOCTOR WEBER WE CONTINUE TO HAVE

01:39:32.566 --> 01:39:34.735
THOSE DISCUSSIONS ON ON THE

01:39:34.802 --> 01:39:35.903
VALUE OF THAT HAVE.

01:39:35.969 --> 01:39:38.105
ATHLETICS ON THE STUDENT BODY

01:39:38.172 --> 01:39:39.440
AND STUDENT BODIES MAKE

01:39:39.506 --> 01:39:41.608
DIFFERENT DECISIONS. TO THIS

01:39:41.675 --> 01:39:44.011
ISSUE THAT I REALLY WASN'T ALL

01:39:44.078 --> 01:39:46.747
THAT FAMILIAR WITH -- WHEN THE

01:39:46.814 --> 01:39:48.449
THE BILL CAME TO MY COMMITTEE?

01:39:48.515 --> 01:39:50.584
I REACHED OUT TO THOSE FOLKS WHO

01:39:50.651 --> 01:39:52.319
I KNEW THAT HAD PLAYED IN

01:39:52.386 --> 01:39:53.520
ATHLETICS.

01:39:53.587 --> 01:39:56.857
I I WENT AND I READ -- KAREEM

01:39:56.924 --> 01:39:59.226
ABDUL JABBAR'S COMMENTS OF HIM

01:39:59.293 --> 01:40:00.761
GOING HUNGRY.

01:40:00.828 --> 01:40:03.430
AS A COLLEGE STUDENT AT UCLA AS

01:40:03.497 --> 01:40:05.599
WITH WHEN HE PLAYED BASKETBALL

01:40:05.666 --> 01:40:08.669
AT UCLA AND AND YOU KNOW I I WAS.

01:40:08.736 --> 01:40:09.703
SURPRISED.

01:40:09.770 --> 01:40:11.338
BY THAT COMMENT.

01:40:11.405 --> 01:40:14.608
I I WENT TO MY FORMER NEIGHBOR.

01:40:14.675 --> 01:40:17.277
SAM NIGHT WHO PLAYED BASKETBALL

01:40:17.344 --> 01:40:19.146
FOR RIVERSIDE COMMUNITY COLLEGE

01:40:19.213 --> 01:40:20.914
I THINK YOU MAY HAVE PLAYED FOR

01:40:20.981 --> 01:40:23.417
COACH TARKANIAN -- WHEN

01:40:23.484 --> 01:40:25.018
UNDERLYING BEACH AND THEN THE U.

01:40:25.085 --> 01:40:27.688
N. L. V. HE HAD THREE SONS?

01:40:27.755 --> 01:40:29.556
HE HAD THREE SONS ALL OF WHOM

01:40:29.623 --> 01:40:30.924
WHO PLAYED FOOTBALL AT THE

01:40:30.991 --> 01:40:31.825
UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN

01:40:31.892 --> 01:40:34.862
CALIFORNIA ALL OF THEM RUNNING

01:40:34.928 --> 01:40:35.929
BACKS AT USC.

01:40:35.996 --> 01:40:37.898
AND THEN THE FATHER SAM WAS MY

01:40:37.965 --> 01:40:39.666
MY NEIGHBOR DOWN THE STREET AND

01:40:39.733 --> 01:40:40.234
I SAID SAM WHAT DO YOU THINK

01:40:40.300 --> 01:40:41.969
ABOUT THIS.

01:40:42.035 --> 01:40:42.603
YOU KNOW WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT

01:40:42.669 --> 01:40:43.737
THIS ISSUE.

01:40:43.804 --> 01:40:44.938
AND HE SHARED WITH ME VERY

01:40:45.005 --> 01:40:46.440
HONESTLY.

01:40:46.507 --> 01:40:48.675
THAT AS A FATHER OF THOSE THREE

01:40:48.742 --> 01:40:50.644
ATHLETES HE WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY

01:40:50.711 --> 01:40:53.080
HAPPY IF HIS SONS WOULD HAVE

01:40:53.147 --> 01:40:54.281
BEEN ABLE TO BENEFIT.

01:40:54.348 --> 01:40:55.849
MATTER OF FACT ONE OF HIS SONS

01:40:55.916 --> 01:40:57.151
THE OLDEST IN THE FIRST ONE TO

01:40:57.217 --> 01:40:59.486
PLAY IT AT USC CAME ON THE LINE

01:40:59.553 --> 01:41:01.255
AND SAID THAT HE WOULD SUPPORT

01:41:01.321 --> 01:41:01.455
THIS.

01:41:01.522 --> 01:41:04.858
AS WELL TO A PERSON.

01:41:04.925 --> 01:41:06.360
THERE WAS NO ONE THAT I TALKED

01:41:06.427 --> 01:41:07.494
TO WHETHER THEY WERE HIGH SCHOOL

01:41:07.561 --> 01:41:10.063
COACHES OUR FORMER ATHLETES.

01:41:10.130 --> 01:41:12.833
HAD OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL.

01:41:12.900 --> 01:41:16.270
SO I I THINK THAT -- THE BILL IS

01:41:16.336 --> 01:41:18.806
IS DEFINITELY WHAT IS NEEDED --

01:41:18.872 --> 01:41:21.542
THAT THE NC DOUBLE A NEEDS TO

01:41:21.608 --> 01:41:23.977
TAKE A HARD LOOK AT ITSELF.

01:41:24.044 --> 01:41:27.214
THAT -- IT IS TIME THAT WE GIVE

01:41:27.281 --> 01:41:29.883
ATHLETES WHAT IS FAIR.

01:41:29.950 --> 01:41:31.852
AND YOU CAN NOT ASK I DON'T

01:41:31.919 --> 01:41:33.854
THINK ATHLETES WERE COACHES MAKE

01:41:33.921 --> 01:41:35.155
ALMOST HALF A MILLION DOLLARS

01:41:35.222 --> 01:41:36.557
AND BRING MILLIONS OF DOLLARS

01:41:36.623 --> 01:41:37.825
INTO A PROGRAM.

01:41:37.891 --> 01:41:40.060
NOT TO BENEFIT FROM THEIR WHAT

01:41:40.127 --> 01:41:41.161
THEY ARE DOING.

01:41:41.228 --> 01:41:42.963
SO I THANK THE AUTHOR FOR

01:41:43.030 --> 01:41:44.698
BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD AND I

01:41:44.765 --> 01:41:46.166
WILL BE SUPPORTING IT -- THIS

01:41:46.233 --> 01:41:47.568
AFTERNOON.

01:41:47.634 --> 01:41:50.404
AND WITH THAT -- CENTER SKINNER

01:42:01.548 --> 01:42:03.250
THIS TO MY ATTENTION AND WE'RE

01:42:03.317 --> 01:42:05.285
TALKING BACK IN THE SEVENTIES.

01:42:05.352 --> 01:42:07.521

01:42:33.180 --> 01:42:35.115
SOMEHOW THE NC TWO EIGHT JUST

01:42:35.182 --> 01:42:36.450
NEEDS A LITTLE MORE TIME.

01:42:36.517 --> 01:42:38.785
WE ARE GIVING IT TO THEM BUT

01:42:38.852 --> 01:42:42.089
THEY HAVE CERTAINLY HAD AMPLE --

01:42:42.155 --> 01:42:43.423

REMEMBER WRITING A CHECK TO IT A

01:44:34.434 --> 01:44:36.236

I LISTEN TO THESE PARENTS AND I

01:44:41.575 --> 01:44:43.744
USED TO TELL THE STUDENTS IF YOU

GET A COLLEGE EDUCATION.

01:44:47.648 --> 01:44:49.249
BUT IT'S THERE IN COLLEGE WHERE

01:44:49.316 --> 01:44:50.550
THESE ATHLETES ARE BEING

01:44:50.617 --> 01:44:52.452
EXPLOITED THE MOST.

01:44:52.519 --> 01:44:55.222

SUPER BOWL MICHAEL CAGE PLAYED

01:45:05.232 --> 01:45:06.667
IN THE NBA BUT MANY OF THESE

01:45:06.733 --> 01:45:08.402
ATHLETES WHILE ON CAMPUS

01:45:08.468 --> 01:45:09.670
STRUGGLE.

01:45:09.736 --> 01:45:11.204
JUST TO KEEP.

01:45:11.271 --> 01:45:12.639

01:45:12.706 --> 01:45:13.407

01:45:13.473 --> 01:45:15.842
AND IF THEY HAD A CAR LEGACY GAS

01:45:15.909 --> 01:45:17.744
IN THEIR CAR THESE ATHLETES EVEN

01:45:17.811 --> 01:45:20.414
ON SCHOLARSHIP WERE STRUGGLING.

01:45:20.480 --> 01:45:21.982
AND THIS IS ABOUT.

01:45:22.049 --> 01:45:24.284
AS WE STATED FAIRNESS AND THE NC

01:45:24.351 --> 01:45:25.786

01:45:27.454 --> 01:45:28.655
THERE ARE ANTIQUATED BILLION

AMERICAN ATHLETES AS CHATTEL.

01:45:36.129 --> 01:45:37.297
FOR OVER FIFTY YEARS AND THE

01:45:37.364 --> 01:45:38.665
ONLY REASON WE HAVE THE TERM OF
