AND I THINK THE COMMITTEE STAFF

00:50:57.387 --> 00:50:58.789
FOR THEIR HARD WORK ON THIS

00:50:58.855 --> 00:51:01.958
ISSUE WITH ME -- THIS IS

00:51:02.025 --> 00:51:03.994
BASICALLY A SIMPLE BILL IT WOULD

00:51:04.060 --> 00:51:05.929
ENABLE A WATER DISTRICT CONTRACT

00:51:05.996 --> 00:51:07.697

TRIBAL LANDS.

00:51:13.170 --> 00:51:15.205
IN TWO YEARS AGO WE FACILITATED

00:51:15.272 --> 00:51:16.907
THE PROVISION OF DRINKING WATER

00:51:16.973 --> 00:51:19.810

DISTRICTS TO SERVICE TRIBAL

00:51:25.248 --> 00:51:27.017
LANDS SO THIS IS KIND OF JUST

00:51:27.083 --> 00:51:29.219
THE OPPOSITE EXCHANGE -- TO

00:51:29.286 --> 00:51:30.954
FACILITATE THE FLOW THE OTHER

00:51:31.021 --> 00:51:31.822
WAY.

00:51:31.888 --> 00:51:34.090
SO -- PAM LOPEZ REPRESENTING THE

00:51:34.157 --> 00:51:36.226

00:51:46.703 --> 00:51:48.171
THE SIMPLE BILL WE UNDERSTAND

00:51:48.238 --> 00:51:49.105
IT'S STILL A BIT OF A WORK IN

00:51:49.172 --> 00:51:51.174
PROGRESS -- BUT THE TRIBE LOOKS

00:51:51.241 --> 00:51:54.110
FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE

00:51:54.177 --> 00:51:55.378
AUTHOR I. AS WE MOVE FORWARD.

00:51:55.445 --> 00:51:56.646
THANK YOU VERY MUCH OTHER OTHER

00:51:56.713 --> 00:51:58.849

ARE THERE ANY WITNESSES IN

00:52:00.050 --> 00:52:03.053
OPPOSITION.

I WAS MAYBE YOU WERE IN BETWEEN --

00:52:15.499 --> 00:52:17.567

00:52:18.535 --> 00:52:20.003
READ GOVERNMENT RELATIONS TODAY

00:52:20.070 --> 00:52:22.739
ON BEHALF OF DESERT WATER AGENCY.

00:52:22.806 --> 00:52:24.941
IT'S LIKELY COUNTERINTUITIVE

00:52:25.008 --> 00:52:26.910
THAT A ONE SENTENCE BILL COULD

00:52:26.977 --> 00:52:28.845
HAVE SO MUCH PACKED INTO IN

00:52:28.912 --> 00:52:30.747
TERMS OF CONTROVERSY BUT ALLOW

00:52:30.814 --> 00:52:33.450
ME TO EXPLAIN WHAT THE ISSUES

00:52:33.517 --> 00:52:35.085
ARE -- WITH THIS BILL.

00:52:35.151 --> 00:52:36.520
FIRST AND FOREMOST IS IT

00:52:36.586 --> 00:52:38.688
CONTRAVENES FEDERAL LAW.

00:52:38.755 --> 00:52:40.090
WHEN THE CONGRESS OR THE

00:52:40.156 --> 00:52:42.492
PRESIDENT ESTABLISHES A

00:52:42.559 --> 00:52:45.529
RESERVATION -- FOR INDIANS

00:52:45.595 --> 00:52:46.897
INDIAN TRIBE.

00:52:46.963 --> 00:52:48.865
IT -- CREATES THAT WITH THE

00:52:48.932 --> 00:52:50.133
INTENTION OF ALLOWING THE

00:52:50.200 --> 00:52:52.168
SETTLEMENTS TO BECOME SELF

00:52:52.235 --> 00:52:53.737
RELIANT SELF SUFFICIENT.

00:52:53.803 --> 00:52:55.438
UNDER THE WINTERS DOCTRINE WHICH

00:52:55.505 --> 00:52:58.141
I COMMUNICATED WITH THE

00:52:58.208 --> 00:52:59.910
COMMITTEE ABOUT WHEN THE

00:52:59.976 --> 00:53:01.344
CONGRESS RESERVES LANDS THAT

00:53:01.411 --> 00:53:03.513
ALSO RESERVES WATER SUFFICIENT

00:53:03.580 --> 00:53:05.081
TO FULFILL THE PURPOSES OF THE

00:53:05.148 --> 00:53:07.183
RESERVATION.

00:53:07.250 --> 00:53:08.418
AS A MATTER OF FEDERAL LAW.

00:53:08.485 --> 00:53:11.521
AN INDIAN TRIBE DOES NOT HAVE

00:53:11.588 --> 00:53:12.622
THE RIGHT TO MARKET ITS

00:53:12.689 --> 00:53:13.223
FACTORIES ARE OF WATER RIGHT.

00:53:13.290 --> 00:53:15.091
FOR OFF RESERVATION USE.

00:53:15.158 --> 00:53:16.593
IF AN INDIAN TRIBE INTENDS TO

00:53:16.660 --> 00:53:18.028
SELL ITS RESERVE WATER TO A

00:53:18.094 --> 00:53:19.629
THIRD PARTY FOR USE OFF THE

00:53:19.696 --> 00:53:20.797
RESERVATION.

00:53:20.864 --> 00:53:22.299
THEN THE WATER BY DEFINITION IS

00:53:22.365 --> 00:53:25.101
BEYOND THAT WHICH IS NECESSARY.

00:53:25.168 --> 00:53:26.503
FOR USE ON THE RESERVATION TO

00:53:26.570 --> 00:53:28.038
FILL FULFILL THE RESERVATION

00:53:28.104 --> 00:53:30.140
PURPOSES AND THE TRIBE DOES NOT

00:53:30.206 --> 00:53:33.109
HAVE A RESERVE RIGHT FOR THAT

00:53:33.176 --> 00:53:34.544
WATER.

00:53:34.611 --> 00:53:35.178
SECOND THERE'S THIS -- SUPPOSE

00:53:35.245 --> 00:53:36.713
THAT NEED FOR MORE WATER STORES

00:53:36.780 --> 00:53:39.215
IN CALIFORNIA I WOULD REMIND THE

00:53:39.282 --> 00:53:40.450
COMMITTEE RESPECTFULLY THAT

00:53:40.517 --> 00:53:43.286
PROPOSITION ONE OF TWENTY

00:53:43.353 --> 00:53:44.621
FOURTEEN SOME OF YOU WERE STILL --

00:53:44.688 --> 00:53:47.257
WE'RE HERE -- SET SET ASIDE TWO

00:53:47.324 --> 00:53:48.925
POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS FOR

00:53:48.992 --> 00:53:50.427
INVESTMENTS IN NEW WATER STORAGE

00:53:50.493 --> 00:53:52.162
PROJECTS IN CALIFORNIA.

00:53:52.228 --> 00:53:53.863
THE WATER COMMISSION AND IS

00:53:53.930 --> 00:53:55.632
ADMINISTERING THE WATER STORES

00:53:55.699 --> 00:53:57.000
INVESTMENT PROGRAM.

00:53:57.067 --> 00:53:59.302
THEY CALLED FOR PROJECTS TO BE

00:53:59.369 --> 00:54:01.605
BROUGHT FORWARD AND APPROVED

00:54:01.671 --> 00:54:04.274
FUNDING FOR EIGHT PROJECTS --

00:54:04.341 --> 00:54:06.009
WITH A MAXIMUM WATER STORAGE

00:54:06.076 --> 00:54:07.477
CAPACITY FOUR POINT THREE

00:54:07.544 --> 00:54:09.145
MILLION ACRE FEET.

00:54:09.212 --> 00:54:11.381
NONE OF THOSE PROJECTS RUN

00:54:11.448 --> 00:54:15.285
RESERVATION LANDS -- AND FINALLY --

00:54:15.352 --> 00:54:16.786
WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT HERE IS

00:54:16.853 --> 00:54:18.788
SINCE THIS IS THE AUTHOR REMOVED

00:54:18.855 --> 00:54:20.557
GROUNDWATER IS ONE OF THE WATER

00:54:20.624 --> 00:54:22.359
SOURCES THAT MAY BE USED UNDER

00:54:22.425 --> 00:54:24.060
THE BILL WE'RE DEALING WITH TWO

00:54:24.127 --> 00:54:26.329
OTHER SOURCES SPRING?

00:54:26.396 --> 00:54:28.031
WHICH IS NOT SUFFICIENT TO BE

00:54:28.098 --> 00:54:29.633
DIVERTED TO SUPPORT A MUNICIPAL

00:54:29.699 --> 00:54:33.303
PURPOSE OR DAM MEAN A RIVER OR

00:54:33.370 --> 00:54:33.803
STREAM.

00:54:33.870 --> 00:54:35.605
THERE'S NO OTHER WAY TO DEVELOP

00:54:35.672 --> 00:54:37.474
WATER ON A RESERVATION SITE

00:54:37.540 --> 00:54:39.075
OTHER THAN THOSE.

00:54:39.142 --> 00:54:40.577
TWO AND I CAN JUST SAY THAT --

00:54:40.644 --> 00:54:42.078
BASED ON EXPERIENCE THAT THERE

00:54:42.145 --> 00:54:45.248
ARE SUCH STREAMS AND RIVERS --

00:54:45.315 --> 00:54:46.216
IT'S QUESTIONABLE WHETHER TRY

00:54:46.282 --> 00:54:47.784
WOULD SUPPORT CONSTRUCTION OF A

00:54:47.851 --> 00:54:49.919
DAM AND RESERVOIR ON TRIBAL

00:54:49.986 --> 00:54:50.920
LANDS.

00:54:50.987 --> 00:54:52.355
A NATIVE AMERICAN PEOPLE'S HAVE

00:54:52.422 --> 00:54:53.823
HAD CONTINUAL INTERACTS WITH

00:54:53.890 --> 00:54:55.325
RIVERS AND STREAMS OVER SEVERAL

00:54:55.392 --> 00:54:57.193
MILLENNIA AND THEIR SOCIAL

00:54:57.260 --> 00:54:58.461
ADDITIONAL AND SPIRITUAL

00:54:58.528 --> 00:54:59.796
ACTIVITIES HAVE BECOME

00:54:59.863 --> 00:55:01.665
INSEPARABLE FROM THE RIVERS

00:55:01.731 --> 00:55:04.200
THEMSELVES -- YOU DON'T ONE CAN

00:55:04.267 --> 00:55:05.669
ONLY LOOK TO THE HOOP BUT KERIK

00:55:05.735 --> 00:55:07.170
IN EUROPE TRIBES IN THE NORTH

00:55:07.237 --> 00:55:08.438
COAST.

00:55:08.505 --> 00:55:10.440
AND THE WOMEN WENT TO TRIBE

00:55:10.507 --> 00:55:11.808
WHO'S FIGHTING THE SHASTA DAM

00:55:11.875 --> 00:55:13.043
REYES.

00:55:13.109 --> 00:55:15.311
NOW THE SHASTA DAM REYES WAS NOT

00:55:15.378 --> 00:55:16.946
ONE OF THE EIGHT PROJECTS ON THE

00:55:17.013 --> 00:55:18.381
WATER COMMISSION LIST.

00:55:18.448 --> 00:55:19.783
BUT THE WOMEN WENT TO TRIBE

00:55:19.849 --> 00:55:21.518
ARGUES THAT WITHOUT THEIR SACRED

00:55:21.584 --> 00:55:23.586
SITES ALONG THE CLOUD RIVER.

00:55:23.653 --> 00:55:24.888
WHICH WE WOULD BE LOST

00:55:24.954 --> 00:55:27.724
INUNDATION WOMEN CULTURE COULD

00:55:27.791 --> 00:55:30.493
NO LONGER EXIST SO THERE THERE'S

00:55:30.560 --> 00:55:31.895
ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES WITH THIS

00:55:31.961 --> 00:55:33.163
BILL.

00:55:33.229 --> 00:55:35.398
THERE'S CONFLICT WITH FEDERAL

00:55:35.465 --> 00:55:37.333
RESERVE RIGHTS AND ESTABLISHED

00:55:37.400 --> 00:55:38.902
FEDERAL LAW.

00:55:38.968 --> 00:55:42.505
THERE'S ALSO POTENTIAL DAMAGE TO

00:55:42.572 --> 00:55:43.673
WRITE TYRIAN SYSTEMS.

00:55:43.740 --> 00:55:45.208
NATIVE AMERICAN FISHERIES

00:55:45.275 --> 00:55:47.177
SUBSTANCE FISHERIES AND WHAT

00:55:47.243 --> 00:55:48.778
HAVE YOU AND I REALIZE THIS IS

00:55:48.845 --> 00:55:50.513
LOCAL GOVERNMENT COMMITTEE AND

00:55:50.580 --> 00:55:51.848
TO BRING THESE ISSUES BEFORE

00:55:51.915 --> 00:55:54.617
THIS COMMITTEE IS A BIT OF A

00:55:54.684 --> 00:55:55.351
CHALLENGE.

00:55:55.418 --> 00:55:55.985
BUT THIS WAS SINGLE REFERRED TO

00:55:56.052 --> 00:55:57.754
THIS COMMITTEE IT REALLY SHOULD

00:55:57.821 --> 00:55:58.621
HAVE BEEN IN THE WATER COMMITTEE

00:55:58.688 --> 00:56:00.924
BUT AGAIN A ONE SENTENCE BILL.

00:56:00.990 --> 00:56:03.026
BUT IT IT BRINGS A LOT OF

00:56:03.093 --> 00:56:04.527
CONTROVERSIAL ISSUES TO THE

00:56:04.594 --> 00:56:06.463
TABLE AND I FELT COMPELLED ON

00:56:06.529 --> 00:56:08.765
BEHALF OF THE WATER AGENCY TO

00:56:08.832 --> 00:56:10.333

AND BE PLEASED TO ANSWER ANY

00:56:11.768 --> 00:56:13.303

BILL.

00:56:17.474 --> 00:56:19.075
SAYING THAT ARE THERE ANY

00:56:19.142 --> 00:56:23.680

THE BILL FORWARD TODAY -- BUT

00:56:39.028 --> 00:56:39.796

WELL -- THANK YOU MISTER BLOOM

TRIBES ARE SOVEREIGN NATIONS.

00:56:51.541 --> 00:56:54.511

ALLOWED WHEN INTERACTING WITH

THE PUBLIC ON SOCIAL MEDIA.

01:06:31.620 --> 01:06:32.988
SOMETHING NOT CONSIDERED WHEN

THE BROWN ACT WAS FIRST ENACTED

01:06:34.924 --> 01:06:36.792

NEARLY FULL ACCESS TO THEIR

01:06:41.897 --> 01:06:42.865
ELECTED OFFICIALS.

01:06:42.932 --> 01:06:44.367
PRIOR TO THE ADVENT OF SOCIAL

MEDIA CONSTITUENTS ONLY ACCESS

SEE THEIR ELECTED OFFICIAL.

01:06:49.138 --> 01:06:50.573
HAPPEN TO RUN INTO THEM WHEN

01:06:50.639 --> 01:06:52.575
THEY'RE OUT ABOUT FOUR TEN

01:06:52.641 --> 01:06:54.143
COUNCIL MEETINGS TODAY THE

01:06:54.210 --> 01:06:55.511

01:06:55.578 --> 01:06:56.946
ACCESS AND CAN VOICE THEIR

01:06:57.012 --> 01:06:58.047
OPINIONS.

01:06:58.114 --> 01:06:59.648
I UNDERSTAND THERE ARE CONCERNS

01:06:59.715 --> 01:07:01.650
REGARDING HOW NARROW SOME OF THE

01:07:01.717 --> 01:07:02.985
DEFINITIONS MIGHT BE.

01:07:03.052 --> 01:07:04.453
THE INTENTION IS TO PROVIDE

01:07:04.520 --> 01:07:06.422
ENOUGH GUIDANCE FOR THE COURTS

01:07:06.489 --> 01:07:07.990
TO DECIDE WHAT CONSTITUTES A

01:07:08.057 --> 01:07:11.494
VIOLATION WHEN ISSUES DO OCCUR.

01:07:11.560 --> 01:07:13.429
THIS BILL DOES NOT ENCOURAGE OR

01:07:13.496 --> 01:07:14.864
ALLOW LOCAL OFFICIALS TO

01:07:14.930 --> 01:07:16.098
DELIBERATE.

01:07:16.165 --> 01:07:18.067
WITHOUT NOTICE ON SOCIAL MEDIA

01:07:18.134 --> 01:07:19.602
BUT INSTEAD PROVIDE STRUCTURE

01:07:19.668 --> 01:07:21.270
AND CLARITY TO INTERACTIONS THAT

01:07:21.337 --> 01:07:23.172
ARE MOST LIKELY ALREADY

01:07:23.239 --> 01:07:24.673
HAPPENING ONLINE.

01:07:24.740 --> 01:07:26.242
I ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT ACCESS TO

01:07:26.308 --> 01:07:28.611
SOCIAL MEDIA IS NOT 1100% BUT

01:07:28.677 --> 01:07:30.613
THAT IS A SEPARATE ISSUE THE

01:07:30.679 --> 01:07:33.516
DIGITAL DIVIDE ISSUE WHICH A

01:07:33.582 --> 01:07:35.217
CONCERN THAT I SHARE.

01:07:35.284 --> 01:07:36.852
WITH MADAM CHAIR.

01:07:36.919 --> 01:07:38.320
BUT THE FACT IS MOST CITIZENS

01:07:38.387 --> 01:07:40.322
TODAY ARE CONNECTED ONLINE AND

01:07:40.389 --> 01:07:42.892
MANY TO SOCIAL MEDIA AS A WAY TO

01:07:42.958 --> 01:07:44.093
INTERACT WITH THEIR ELECTED.

01:07:44.160 --> 01:07:45.561
AND I'M SURE WE ALL EXPERIENCE

01:07:45.628 --> 01:07:46.896
FROM OUR OWN SOCIAL MEDIA

01:07:46.962 --> 01:07:47.997
INTERACTIONS MANY OF THOSE

01:07:48.063 --> 01:07:49.432
CITIZENS ARE VERY COMFORTABLE

01:07:49.498 --> 01:07:51.167
EXPRESSING THEIR OPINIONS.

01:07:51.233 --> 01:07:55.171
ON ISSUES THAT MATTER TO THEM.

01:07:55.237 --> 01:07:56.705
TO TO PUT IT LIGHTLY OUGHT TO

01:07:56.772 --> 01:07:58.407
EXCLUDE A SOCIAL MEDIA

01:07:58.474 --> 01:07:59.842

01:07:59.909 --> 01:08:01.844
ENGAGEMENT AND DOES A DISSERVICE

01:08:01.911 --> 01:08:03.345
TO THE PUBLIC WHILE UNDERMINING

01:08:03.412 --> 01:08:04.647
TRANSPARENCY.

01:08:04.713 --> 01:08:05.815
I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO NOTE THAT

01:08:05.881 --> 01:08:07.883

01:08:13.355 --> 01:08:14.757
WE WERE DOING ANYTHING TO

01:08:14.824 --> 01:08:16.125
UNDERMINE THE BROWN ACT BECAUSE

01:08:16.192 --> 01:08:17.393
THAT'S NOT SOMETHING I WANT TO

01:08:17.460 --> 01:08:18.861
BE ASSOCIATED WITH.

01:08:18.928 --> 01:08:21.897
THEIR ANSWER WAS DEFINITIVELY NO.

01:08:21.964 --> 01:08:23.232
AS I CONVEYED TO THEM AND THEY

01:08:23.299 --> 01:08:24.333
UNDERSTOOD WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO

01:08:24.400 --> 01:08:26.068
DO IS TO SIMPLY CLARIFY WHAT'S

01:08:26.135 --> 01:08:28.070
APPROPRIATE AND WHAT'S NOT IN

01:08:28.137 --> 01:08:29.371
THE DIGITAL AGE.

01:08:29.438 --> 01:08:31.340
WE ARE OPEN TO CONTINUE WORKING

01:11:13.702 --> 01:11:15.104
TO ALLOW THEM TO DO SO.

01:11:59.982 --> 01:12:01.350
CALIFORNIA NEWS PUBLISHERS

01:12:01.417 --> 01:12:05.287
ASSOCIATION -- I'D LIKE TO TO

01:12:05.354 --> 01:12:06.188
SAY AT THE OUTSET THAT

01:12:06.255 --> 01:12:08.123
IDEOLOGICALLY SEEIN PAY IS NOT

01:12:08.190 --> 01:12:09.625
OPPOSED TO THE USE OF SOCIAL

01:12:09.692 --> 01:12:12.695
MEDIA BY ELECTED MEMBERS OF

01:12:12.761 --> 01:12:13.629
BROWN ACT BODIES.

01:12:13.696 --> 01:12:15.164
BUT BASED ON THE PROPOSAL BUT

01:12:15.230 --> 01:12:16.265
IT'S CURRENTLY BEFORE THE

01:12:16.331 --> 01:12:17.733
COMMITTEE WE HAVE SOME VERY

01:12:17.800 --> 01:12:19.735
SERIOUS CONCERNS ABOUT HOW IT

01:12:19.802 --> 01:12:21.670
WOULD OPERATE.

01:12:21.737 --> 01:12:23.872
ON THE BROWN ACT WAS PASSED --

01:12:23.939 --> 01:12:25.441
BACK IN NINETEEN FIFTY THREE FOR

01:12:25.507 --> 01:12:26.742
THE EXPRESS PURPOSE TO GUARANTEE

01:12:26.809 --> 01:12:29.378
THAT THE PUBLIC'S BUSINESS --

01:12:29.445 --> 01:12:32.147
CONDUCTED BY A LOCAL AGENCY IS

01:12:32.214 --> 01:12:33.282
DONE IN AN OPEN AND PUBLIC

01:12:33.348 --> 01:12:36.018
MANNER -- AND ONE OF THE KEY

01:12:36.085 --> 01:12:38.620
COMPONENTS OF THAT IS TO PROVIDE

01:12:38.687 --> 01:12:40.622
NOTICE TO THE PUBLIC OF WHAT IT

01:12:40.689 --> 01:12:42.624
IS THAT THE BODY INTENDS. TO DO

01:12:42.691 --> 01:12:44.359
WHETHER IT'S A DELIBERATION

01:12:44.426 --> 01:12:45.761
WHETHER IT'S DISCUSSION WHETHER

01:12:45.828 --> 01:12:47.496
IT'S AN ACTION.

01:12:47.563 --> 01:12:49.531
AND SOCIAL MEDIA IN AND OF

01:12:49.598 --> 01:12:50.332
ITSELF ONE OF THE KEY

01:12:50.399 --> 01:12:53.068
CHARACTERISTICS OF SOCIAL MEDIA --

01:12:53.135 --> 01:12:55.971
THAT MAKES IT SUCH A A GLAMOROUS

01:12:56.038 --> 01:12:58.507
THING TO USE -- IS ITS

01:12:58.574 --> 01:12:59.742
SPONTANEITY A JUST LIKE A

01:12:59.808 --> 01:13:02.511
CONVERSATION IN A ROOM WHERE YOU

01:13:02.578 --> 01:13:03.312
HAVE NO IDEA WHERE IT'S GOING TO

01:13:03.378 --> 01:13:06.014
GO -- WHICH MAKES IT VERY

01:13:06.081 --> 01:13:08.150
DIFFICULT FOR BODY TO PROVIDE

01:13:08.217 --> 01:13:10.319
THE REQUISITE NOTICE IN THE ACT

01:13:10.385 --> 01:13:11.453
RIGHT NOW.

01:13:11.520 --> 01:13:13.388
UNFORTUNATELY SB NINE NINETY

01:13:13.455 --> 01:13:17.326
DOES NOT ADDRESS THAT ISSUE --

01:13:17.392 --> 01:13:20.362
AND IT'S REALLY HARD TO ENVISION --

01:13:20.429 --> 01:13:22.965
AT LEAST UNDER THE THE LANGUAGE

01:13:23.031 --> 01:13:23.966
NOW.

01:13:24.032 --> 01:13:26.368
OUR HOW OF THE USE OF SOCIAL

01:13:26.435 --> 01:13:29.304
MEDIA BY A BODY WOULD NOT

01:13:29.371 --> 01:13:31.039
VIOLATE THE SERIAL MEETING UP

01:13:31.106 --> 01:13:32.875
PROVISION OF THE BROWN ACT WHICH

01:13:32.941 --> 01:13:35.210
AGAIN IS A KEY COMPONENT OF THE

01:13:35.277 --> 01:13:37.646
BROWN ACT. TO ENSURE THAT THE

01:13:37.713 --> 01:13:39.281
PUBLIC'S BUSINESS IS DONE OPENLY

01:13:39.348 --> 01:13:41.450
AND PUBLICLY. FOR EXAMPLE IF WE

01:13:41.517 --> 01:13:42.518
LOOK AT THE DEFINITION OF

01:13:42.584 --> 01:13:43.952
DISCUSS AMONGST THEMSELVES THERE

01:13:44.019 --> 01:13:46.488
ARE TWO EXCEPTIONS.

01:13:46.555 --> 01:13:51.460
TO THAT -- THAT TERM IN THE BILL

01:13:51.527 --> 01:13:53.495
ONE IS -- IT WOULD ALLOW

01:13:53.562 --> 01:13:55.397
INDIVIDUAL COMMUNICATIONS ARE

01:13:55.464 --> 01:13:58.600
MADE POSTED OR SHARED. TO THAT

01:13:58.667 --> 01:14:00.669
SO LONG AS THE COMMUNICATIONS BY

01:14:00.736 --> 01:14:02.004
A MEMBER OF THE BODY DO NOT

01:14:02.070 --> 01:14:05.040
DIRECTLY RESPOND TO ANOTHER

01:14:05.107 --> 01:14:06.708
MEMBERS COMMUNICATIONS.

01:14:06.775 --> 01:14:09.077
BUT THAT DOES NOT PRECLUDE OF

01:14:09.144 --> 01:14:12.014
THIRD PARTY FROM REFERRING TO A

01:14:12.080 --> 01:14:14.683
MEMBERS COMMUNICATION -- IN A

01:14:14.750 --> 01:14:16.819
SUBSEQUENT SERIES OF

01:14:16.885 --> 01:14:19.154
COMMUNICATIONS ARE -- TWEET THAT

01:14:19.221 --> 01:14:22.024
REFERENCES OF ONE MEMBERS --

01:14:22.090 --> 01:14:25.194
COMMUNICATION BY TWO OTHER

01:14:25.260 --> 01:14:26.061
MEMBERS OF A FIVE MEMBER BODY.

01:14:26.128 --> 01:14:28.530
WOULD BE A VIOLATION UNDER THE

01:14:28.597 --> 01:14:29.998
LAW IN ANY OTHER.

01:14:30.065 --> 01:14:32.434
CONTEXT BUT NOT UNDER THE

01:14:32.501 --> 01:14:35.971
LANGUAGE IN -- EIGHTY NINE

01:14:36.038 --> 01:14:37.005
NINETY TWO SIMILARLY OF THE USE

01:14:37.072 --> 01:14:40.275
OF ICONS OR OTHER -- IMHO JEEZ

01:14:40.342 --> 01:14:42.244
IF YOU WILL -- TO COMMUNICATE AN

01:14:42.311 --> 01:14:46.081
IDEA OR OPINION OR THOUGHT -- IF

01:14:46.148 --> 01:14:47.683
ASSUMING AGAIN A FIVE MEMBER

01:14:47.749 --> 01:14:50.652
BODY YOU HAVE AN INDIVIDUAL --

01:14:50.719 --> 01:14:54.623
MEMBER WHO -- EXPRESSES A FOUGHT

01:14:54.690 --> 01:14:56.992
ON A POSITION ON AN ISSUE BEFORE

01:14:57.059 --> 01:14:59.761
THE BODY. TO OTHER MEMBERS GIVE

01:14:59.828 --> 01:15:01.096
A THUMBS UP.

01:15:01.163 --> 01:15:02.431
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN DOES THAT

01:15:02.497 --> 01:15:03.665
MEAN THAT THEY'RE IN AGREEMENT

01:15:03.732 --> 01:15:05.400
HAS CONSENSUS BEEN REACHED THAT

01:15:05.467 --> 01:15:07.502
IS TOTALLY UNCLEAR UNDER THE

01:15:07.569 --> 01:15:09.004
LANGUAGE IN THE BILL RIGHT NOW?

01:15:09.071 --> 01:15:10.439
SO RATHER THAN CLARIFY I THINK

01:15:10.505 --> 01:15:12.908
IT RAISES ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS.

01:15:12.975 --> 01:15:14.877
THERE IS THE DIGITAL DIVIDE

01:15:14.943 --> 01:15:18.347
ISSUE THAT EXIST ARM AND THAT --

01:15:18.413 --> 01:15:19.681
IS NOT ONLY THOSE THAT HAVE

01:15:19.748 --> 01:15:21.216
ACCESS TO THE INTERNET BUT THERE

01:15:21.283 --> 01:15:22.684
MAY BE THOSE THAT HAVE ACCESS TO

01:15:22.751 --> 01:15:25.587
THE INTERNET BUT DON'T CHOOSE TO

01:15:25.654 --> 01:15:26.855
USE SOCIAL MEDIA.

01:15:26.922 --> 01:15:28.423
OUR AS A MEANS OF COMMUNICATION

01:15:28.490 --> 01:15:30.025
AND SO THEY WOULD BE.

01:15:30.092 --> 01:15:32.060
EXCLUDED FROM THE DEVELOPMENT OF

01:15:32.127 --> 01:15:34.463
PUBLIC POLICY OR EVEN THE FORMAL

01:15:34.529 --> 01:15:38.433
ACTION OF A POTENTIAL OF VOTE BY

01:15:38.500 --> 01:15:41.203
BY A BODY -- HAVING SAID ALL

01:15:41.270 --> 01:15:43.872
THAT -- WE RECOGNIZE THAT SOCIAL

01:15:43.939 --> 01:15:45.774
MEDIA IS AN EFFECTIVE TOOL FOR

01:15:45.841 --> 01:15:47.709
CONSTITUENTS TO USE TO

01:15:47.776 --> 01:15:48.644
COMMUNICATE WITH THE ELECTED

01:15:48.710 --> 01:15:52.915
MEMBERS OF THEIR BODY -- AND WE

01:15:52.981 --> 01:15:54.182
WILL STAND READY WILLING AND

01:15:54.249 --> 01:15:55.751
ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE

01:15:55.817 --> 01:15:57.486
DISCUSSIONS AND THE DEVELOPMENT

01:15:57.552 --> 01:16:00.756
OF GOOD SOCIAL MEDIA POLICY --

01:16:00.822 --> 01:16:03.191
AS IT MOVES FORWARD -- WE HAVE

01:16:03.258 --> 01:16:04.559
HAD THOSE DISCUSSIONS WITH THE

01:16:04.626 --> 01:16:06.061
LEAGUE WITH THE SPECIAL

01:16:06.128 --> 01:16:09.398

BILL AS IT'S WRITTEN NOW --

01:16:11.433 --> 01:16:14.036
DOESN'T GET US THERE QUITE YET --

01:16:14.102 --> 01:16:16.405
AND IF THE COMMITTEE DOES DECIDE

01:16:16.471 --> 01:16:19.007

LESS WE STAND READY WILLING AND

ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN THOSE

01:16:23.645 --> 01:16:27.015
DISCUSSIONS BUT AS OF NOW --

01:16:27.082 --> 01:16:28.850
WE'RE ASKING FOR NO LOOK.

01:16:28.917 --> 01:16:29.751
THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF THE

01:16:29.818 --> 01:16:31.987

TWENTY SIXTEEN WITH THE LEAGUE

01:16:51.006 --> 01:16:51.506
OF CITIES.

01:16:51.573 --> 01:16:53.241
I WAS SHOCKED TO LEARN THAT IF

01:16:55.243 --> 01:16:57.646
INCIDENTLY LIKE THE SAME.

01:16:57.713 --> 01:16:59.281
ARTICLE ON FACEBOOK THAT THAT

01:16:59.348 --> 01:17:00.215
COULD HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED A

01:17:00.282 --> 01:17:02.517
BROWN ACT VIOLATION AND YOU KNOW

01:17:02.584 --> 01:17:04.319
SINCE THE PURVIEW OF LOCAL

01:17:17.199 --> 01:17:18.767

01:17:18.834 --> 01:17:20.769
CLARIFICATION A MUCH NEEDED MOVE

01:17:20.836 --> 01:17:21.670

AND SCROLL THROUGH THREE HUNDRED

01:17:29.811 --> 01:17:30.912
LIKES TO SEE IF ANY OF MY OTHER

01:17:30.979 --> 01:17:32.647

01:17:33.548 --> 01:17:34.583
VIOLATE THE PRODUCT.

01:17:34.649 --> 01:17:36.118
AND IN THE END YOU KNOW AND WHEN

YOU HAVE SMALLER COMMUNITIES MY

01:17:37.519 --> 01:17:39.488

BE AND AND STILL NOTHING THAT

01:17:42.724 --> 01:17:44.092

ATTENDING TO DRAW ALSO CO LINES

LOT OF SMALLER JURISDICTIONS AND

THE LEGISLATION IS.

01:18:39.581 --> 01:18:41.550
PROVIDE SOME CLARITY AS FAR AS

01:18:41.616 --> 01:18:43.485
THE INTERACTIONS AMONGST THE

01:18:43.552 --> 01:18:45.120
ELECTED OFFICIALS THEMSELVES

01:18:45.187 --> 01:18:46.855
BECAUSE WHAT I SEE IS.

01:18:46.922 --> 01:18:47.789
THESE COUNCIL MEMBERS ARE

01:18:47.856 --> 01:18:49.191
SUPERVISORS ENGAGING WITH ONE

01:18:49.257 --> 01:18:50.692
ANOTHER AND COMING FROM LOCAL

01:18:50.759 --> 01:18:52.027
GOVERNMENT.

01:18:52.094 --> 01:18:53.528
KNOWING THAT TO MY COLLEAGUES

01:18:53.595 --> 01:18:54.029
ARE TAKING A POSITION ON

01:18:54.096 --> 01:18:55.330
SOMETHING [inaudible]

01:18:55.397 --> 01:18:57.065
YOU NOW.

01:18:57.132 --> 01:18:58.433
SHOWING ME THEIR CARS AND WHERE

01:18:58.500 --> 01:18:59.401
THEY STAND ON ISSUES IN MY

01:18:59.468 --> 01:19:01.036
OPINION POSES A PROBLEM AND

01:19:01.103 --> 01:19:02.838
SOMETIMES EVEN A THIRD WILL JUMP

01:19:02.904 --> 01:19:04.306
IN BUT THERE'S SUCH A LACK OF

01:19:04.372 --> 01:19:06.074
CLARITY IS SUCH A GRAY AREA WHEN

01:19:06.141 --> 01:19:06.975
IT COMES THE BROWN ACT.

01:19:07.042 --> 01:19:08.043
ASSISTANT I APPRECIATE

01:19:08.110 --> 01:19:09.311
LEGISLATION I THINK THAT IT

01:19:09.377 --> 01:19:11.580
NEEDS TO BE STRAIGHTENED A BIT --

01:19:11.646 --> 01:19:16.084
TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ADDRESS NOT

01:19:16.151 --> 01:19:17.419
ALLOWABLE IN INTO THE

01:19:17.486 --> 01:19:18.987
COMMUNICATION BETWEEN ELECTED

01:19:19.054 --> 01:19:21.756
OFFICIALS BUT AS FAR AS THEM

01:19:21.823 --> 01:19:23.358
USING THIS AS A VEHICLE.

01:19:23.425 --> 01:19:24.593
TO ENGAGE THEIR CITIZENS THE

01:19:24.659 --> 01:19:25.560
CONSTITUENCIES I THINK IT'S VERY

01:19:25.627 --> 01:19:27.896
IMPORTANT AND SO ANYWAY THAT WE

01:19:27.963 --> 01:19:29.998
CAN STRENGTHEN OUR ABILITY. TO

01:19:30.065 --> 01:19:32.467
TO CLARIFY -- OUR ABILITY TO USE

01:19:32.534 --> 01:19:35.871
IT AND LOCAL OFFICIALS THESE IT

01:19:35.937 --> 01:19:39.374
I THINK IS A VERY POSITIVE STEP.

01:19:39.441 --> 01:19:42.310
FOR A SIMILAR SO ASSEMBLY MEMBER

01:19:42.377 --> 01:19:44.146

01:20:03.331 --> 01:20:05.000
MAY BE AND CLEAR IS WHAT THE

01:20:05.066 --> 01:20:08.336
DEFINITION OF A DISCUSSION IS

01:20:08.403 --> 01:20:11.439

THAT OR IF -- LIKE IT COULD

01:20:33.361 --> 01:20:35.997

SOCIAL MEDIA WITH REGARD TO

01:20:59.421 --> 01:21:01.957
BUSINESS OF A SPECIFIC NATURE.

01:21:02.023 --> 01:21:03.425
IN THE SUBJECT MATTER

SO -- UNDER A SCENARIO WHERE --

01:21:09.431 --> 01:21:12.901
A MEMBER -- OF THE CITY COUNCIL

01:23:59.868 --> 01:24:01.136
BUT WHAT WHAT WE ALSO MAKE IT

01:24:01.202 --> 01:24:01.703
VERY CLEAR THAT WE THAT THE

01:24:01.770 --> 01:24:03.638
LEAGUE DOES NOT PROVIDE DIRECTLY --

01:24:03.705 --> 01:24:05.507
COUNCIL IN THAT WE UNDER THE

01:24:05.573 --> 01:24:06.508
CURRENT PARADIGM WE HAVE TO THEM

01:24:06.574 --> 01:24:08.676
PUSH -- THOSE CONVERSATIONS

01:24:08.743 --> 01:24:09.711
LOCALLY TO OUR CITY ATTORNEYS

01:24:09.778 --> 01:24:11.012
AND SEEK THEIR COUNSEL AND SO

01:24:11.079 --> 01:24:12.347
THAT'S REALLY YOU KNOW WHEN.

01:24:12.414 --> 01:24:14.682
WHEN COMING UP WITH THIS CONCEPT --

01:24:14.749 --> 01:24:15.950
WE IN THE LEAGUE OF CITIES HAS A

01:24:16.017 --> 01:24:17.085
BROWN ACT WORKING GROUP

01:24:17.152 --> 01:24:18.086
COMPRISED OF CITY ATTORNEY'S

01:24:18.153 --> 01:24:20.121
ACROSS CALIFORNIA AND REALLY

01:24:20.188 --> 01:24:21.523
WHEN WE WERE DISCUSSING THIS

01:24:21.589 --> 01:24:22.590
ISSUE.

01:24:22.657 --> 01:24:23.825
IF YOU KNOW WHAT THE SAME CISCO

01:24:23.892 --> 01:24:24.759
CITY ATTORNEY SEES A COMPLETELY

01:24:24.826 --> 01:24:26.194
DIFFERENT THAT AND YOU KNOW THEN

01:24:26.261 --> 01:24:27.228
THE CITY ATTORNEY THAT'S THAT'S

01:24:27.295 --> 01:24:29.230
DOWN SOUTH -- AND SO THERE IS

01:24:29.297 --> 01:24:31.599
THAT THAT IS PRECISELY WHERE

01:24:31.666 --> 01:24:32.233
WITH THE IMPETUS THIS BILL CAME

01:24:32.300 --> 01:24:33.535
FROM IS THAT WE COULDN'T COME TO

01:24:33.601 --> 01:24:35.136
A CONSENSUS BECAUSE WITH REGARD

01:24:35.203 --> 01:24:37.972
TO THE BROWN ACT IT WAS PASSED.

01:24:38.039 --> 01:24:38.573
NINETEEN FIFTY THREE WERE YOU

01:24:38.640 --> 01:24:40.642
KNOW WERE WERE WARNED IT AND

01:24:40.708 --> 01:24:41.676
DON'T YOU KNOW AND ENGAGING AND

01:24:41.743 --> 01:24:42.911
AND AND IN THE DIGITAL AGE.

01:24:42.977 --> 01:24:43.912
AND SO THAT'S EXACTLY WHY WE

01:24:43.978 --> 01:24:45.346
WANTED THIS MEASURE FOR CLARITY

01:24:45.413 --> 01:24:46.181
BECAUSE IT IS A STATE WIDE

01:24:46.247 --> 01:24:47.449
STATUE THAT WE HAVE TO FOLLOW

01:24:47.515 --> 01:24:50.118
BUT THE INTERPRETATIONS VARY

01:24:50.185 --> 01:24:50.585
FROM JURISDICTION TO

01:24:50.652 --> 01:24:51.986
JURISDICTION.

01:24:52.053 --> 01:24:52.954
I THINK PART OF MY OF MY

01:24:53.021 --> 01:24:54.589
QUESTION IS YOU KNOW IT'S A

01:24:54.656 --> 01:24:55.690
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THEY'RE THE

01:24:55.757 --> 01:24:56.591
ONES THAT ARE GONNA BE IMPACTED

01:24:56.658 --> 01:24:57.258
BY.

01:24:57.325 --> 01:24:59.761
ANY RULES THAT ARE ADOPTED WITH

01:24:59.828 --> 01:25:00.762
THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD.

01:25:00.829 --> 01:25:02.297
OR NOT BUT IT'S AT THE LOCAL

01:25:02.363 --> 01:25:04.799
JURISDICTION WHERE THAT.

01:25:04.866 --> 01:25:06.901
THAT DISCUSSION NEEDS TO BE HELD

01:25:06.968 --> 01:25:08.670
IN OPEN FORUM ON WHETHER IT'S AT

01:25:08.736 --> 01:25:10.138
THE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS

01:25:10.205 --> 01:25:11.873
A CITY COUNCIL BECAUSE THEY'RE

01:25:11.940 --> 01:25:12.807
THE ONES THAT ARE GOING TO BE

01:25:12.874 --> 01:25:22.851
HELD ACCOUNTABLE TO THAT POLICY

01:25:22.917 --> 01:25:24.886
THAT'S THEIRWELL I SAID ON THE

01:25:24.953 --> 01:25:25.520
COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS WE

01:25:25.587 --> 01:25:25.820
HAD A DAT.

01:25:25.887 --> 01:25:26.421
THE THE BROWN ACTED IMPLEMENT

01:25:26.488 --> 01:25:26.988
NEW POLICIES TO CONTINUE TO

01:25:27.055 --> 01:25:28.423
COMPLY WITH THOSE AND WE HAD --

01:25:28.490 --> 01:25:29.491
STUDY SESSIONS WE HAD A SERIES

01:25:29.557 --> 01:25:30.525
OF OPEN DIALOGUE WITH THE PUBLIC

01:25:31.960 --> 01:25:32.427
AREAS TO HAVE THAT THAT

01:25:32.494 --> 01:25:33.428
ENCOURAGEMENT OF THAT POLICY

COUNCIL WOULD MOVE FORWARD WE

01:25:35.897 --> 01:25:37.332
WRAPPED UP AS A BOARD.

01:25:37.398 --> 01:25:38.500
THAT BECOMES PART OF THE THE

01:25:38.566 --> 01:25:40.969
ADHERENCE TO THE TO THE POLICY

WITHOUT KNOWING THAT THE LOCAL

01:25:44.506 --> 01:25:46.107
GOVERNMENTS HAVE EXHAUSTED ALL

01:25:46.174 --> 01:25:47.909
THAT THAT'S THERE AND AND THEIR

01:25:47.976 --> 01:25:50.211
PURVIEW TO IMPLEMENT THAT RULE

THEY'RE GOING TO BE FOLLOWING.

01:25:53.781 --> 01:25:54.716

YEAH SO -- SOME OF THE RIVER ONE

01:27:58.406 --> 01:27:59.173
OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE HEARD

01:27:59.240 --> 01:28:00.041
FROM MY SPECIAL DISTRICTS IS IS

01:28:00.108 --> 01:28:01.776
IS THAT THAT THEY HAVE ADOPTED.

01:28:01.843 --> 01:28:02.610
POLICIES AND WHAT'S THE WHAT'S

01:28:02.677 --> 01:28:03.678
HAPPENING IS WE'RE HAVING A

01:28:03.745 --> 01:28:04.278
POLICY AT ONE DISTRICT IN THAT

01:28:04.345 --> 01:28:05.213
POLICIES SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT

01:28:05.279 --> 01:28:05.780
THAN THE POLICY THAT IS AT

01:28:05.847 --> 01:28:06.881
ANOTHER DISTRICT WHICH IS WHAT

01:28:06.948 --> 01:28:07.882
WHAT I BELIEVE THE THE LEASE

01:28:07.949 --> 01:28:08.449
CITIES WAS SAYING IS THAT.

01:28:08.516 --> 01:28:09.751
THEY'RE THEY HAVE LOOKED AT THIS

THEY HAVE THEIR THEIR COUNCILS

01:28:10.451 --> 01:28:11.185
LOOK AT AND THEY'VE ADOPTED

01:28:11.252 --> 01:28:12.520
POLICIES FOR THEIR CITY.

01:28:12.587 --> 01:28:14.489
AND IN ONE CITY IS VASTLY

01:28:14.555 --> 01:28:16.257
DIFFERENT FROM ANOTHER CITY AND

01:28:16.324 --> 01:28:17.525
THEY'RE THEY'RE OPERATING UNDER

01:28:17.592 --> 01:28:18.292
DIFFERENT RULES BUT THEY'RE

01:28:18.359 --> 01:28:20.261
FOLLOWING THE LAW THE FOLLOWING

01:28:20.328 --> 01:28:21.796
THE RULES AS THEY INTERPRET IT.

01:28:21.863 --> 01:28:23.097
BUT THEIR INTERPRETATION IS SO

01:28:23.164 --> 01:28:24.565
DIFFERENT THAT THEY'RE THAT

01:28:24.632 --> 01:28:26.134
THEY'RE ASKING FOR THE GUIDANCE

01:28:26.200 --> 01:28:27.702
SIMILAR TO WHAT YOU KNOW WHAT

01:28:27.769 --> 01:28:30.071
WHAT WE'RE SEEING -- ON THE THE

01:28:30.138 --> 01:28:31.572
BACK BAND THROUGH THEIR RIGHT WE

01:28:31.639 --> 01:28:32.507
HAD A DIFFERENT JURISDICTION

01:28:32.573 --> 01:28:34.409
HAVING DIFFERENT RULES ON ON

01:28:34.475 --> 01:28:36.110
WHAT WAS ALLOWED WHAT WASN'T --

01:28:36.177 --> 01:28:39.213
AND THE THE GOOD THE THE

01:28:39.280 --> 01:28:40.381
INDUSTRY CAME AND SAID HEY LOOK.

01:28:40.448 --> 01:28:42.617
WE RATHER JUST HAVE ONE POLICY

01:28:42.684 --> 01:28:43.518
SO THAT WE KNOW PROVIDED THE

01:28:43.584 --> 01:28:44.652
GUIDES AND THAT'S WHERE WE'REAT

01:28:44.719 --> 01:28:46.521
AT THIS POINT WE HAVE POLICIES

01:28:46.587 --> 01:28:49.190
AT AT THAT VARYING AGENCIES.

01:28:49.257 --> 01:28:50.725
WE'RE LOOKING FOR ONE THE

01:28:50.792 --> 01:28:51.759
CLARITY SO THAT WE ACTUALLY HAVE.

01:28:51.826 --> 01:28:52.927
YOU KNOW THE SIMILAR POLICY

01:28:52.994 --> 01:28:54.195
THROUGHOUT THE STATE BUT ISN'T

01:28:54.262 --> 01:28:55.897
THAT THE THE NUCLEUS OF LOCAL

01:28:55.963 --> 01:28:57.198
GOVERNMENT TO BE ABLE TO

01:28:57.265 --> 01:28:58.132
DISAGREE OR HAVE DIFFERENT

01:28:58.199 --> 01:29:06.374
POLICIES ON DIFFERENT THINGS HOW

01:29:06.441 --> 01:29:07.008
THEY'RE IMPLEMENTING A COMPLYING

01:29:07.075 --> 01:29:11.579
WITH LAW.

01:29:11.646 --> 01:29:14.248
THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE YES SOME

ON THIS TOO I I I I CERTAINLY

01:29:20.054 --> 01:29:20.588
THINK THERE'S ALWAYS A GOOD

01:29:20.655 --> 01:29:21.856
ARGUMENT TO BE MADE FOR LOCAL

01:29:21.923 --> 01:29:22.757
CONTROL -- BUT THERE'S ALSO I

01:29:22.824 --> 01:29:23.257
THINK A REALLY IMPORTANT

01:29:23.324 --> 01:29:24.525
ARGUMENT TO BE MADE HERE FOR

01:29:24.592 --> 01:29:27.161
UNIFORMITY IN IN OUR LAWS THE

01:29:27.228 --> 01:29:27.995
THE BROWN ACT AS A STATE LAW.

01:29:28.062 --> 01:29:29.397
THAT APPLIES EQUALLY TO ALL

01:29:29.464 --> 01:29:30.398
JURISDICTIONS AND THE BETTER THE

01:29:30.465 --> 01:29:32.400
UNIFORMITY OF UNDERSTANDING OF

01:29:32.467 --> 01:29:35.236
THAT LAW IS AND THE MORE EVENLY

01:29:35.303 --> 01:29:35.570
IT'S APPLIED.

01:29:35.636 --> 01:29:37.739
THEN THE EASIER IT IS FOR

01:29:37.805 --> 01:29:41.275
INDIVIDUAL COUNCIL MEMBERS -- TO

01:29:41.342 --> 01:29:41.943

01:42:01.748 --> 01:42:04.117
CONTRACTS TO NEW CONTRACTORS NO

01:42:04.184 --> 01:42:05.953

01:42:06.019 --> 01:42:07.154
INDUSTRY IS BOOMING WITH

01:42:07.221 --> 01:42:08.388
INNOVATION.

01:42:08.455 --> 01:42:10.557
SIMPLY BECAUSE IT'S WIDE OPEN

01:42:10.624 --> 01:42:13.193
AND AND WE FEEL THAT BECOMES THE

01:42:13.260 --> 01:42:15.362
WHOLE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY HAVE

01:42:15.429 --> 01:42:16.864
CLAMPED DOWN ON THIS ON THIS

01:42:16.930 --> 01:42:19.433
INDUSTRY SO THAT WE CAN GET NEW

01:42:19.500 --> 01:42:20.934
COMPANIES AND WE CAN'T GET NEW

01:42:21.001 --> 01:42:22.803
INNOVATION WE CAN'T GET GUYS

01:42:22.870 --> 01:42:24.238
COMING OUT A CUP COMING OUT OF

01:42:24.304 --> 01:42:25.138
COLLEGE.

01:42:25.205 --> 01:42:27.608
THAT CAN COME INTO A PROCESS

01:42:27.674 --> 01:42:29.409
WHERE THEY CAN GET EASILY EASY

01:42:29.476 --> 01:42:31.411
CONTRACTS LIKE THIS SO THAT THEY

01:42:31.478 --> 01:42:33.180
COULD BUILD THE COMPANY FROM

01:42:33.247 --> 01:42:34.581
NOTHING TO SOMETHING.

01:42:34.648 --> 01:42:38.752
AND WE HAVE MANY OMPANIES STUCK

01:42:38.819 --> 01:42:40.020
IN.

01:42:40.087 --> 01:42:42.389
VERY SMALL -- POOL OF WE HAVE A

01:42:42.456 --> 01:42:43.156
REALLY SMALL CONTRACTS AND WE

01:42:43.223 --> 01:42:43.690
THINK THAT WHAT THE WATER

01:42:43.757 --> 01:42:45.626
DISTRICT IS TRYING TO DO IS OPEN

01:42:45.692 --> 01:42:47.027
IT UP EVEN MORE AND I'LL

01:42:47.094 --> 01:42:48.729
CONVERSATIONS WITH THEM.

01:42:48.795 --> 01:42:50.230
I REALLY THINK THE FIFTY

01:42:50.297 --> 01:42:51.532
THOUSAND DOLLAR LIMIT IS REALLY

01:42:51.598 --> 01:42:52.799
WEAK RIGHT.

01:42:52.866 --> 01:42:54.268
BUT I THINK IT IS THE LEAST THAT

01:42:54.334 --> 01:42:55.802
YOU CAN DO AT SOUTH STATE

01:42:55.869 --> 01:42:57.471
LEGISLATORS WE DON'T KNOW HOW TO

01:42:57.538 --> 01:42:59.373
DO WITH CAPITALISM THE WAY IT IS

01:42:59.439 --> 01:43:00.240
RIGHT NOW.

01:43:00.307 --> 01:43:02.376
BECAUSE ANY BIG ELECTRICAL

01:43:02.442 --> 01:43:04.077
COMPANY IS NOT GOING TO LET ME

01:43:04.144 --> 01:43:05.612
START ELECTRICAL COMPANY AND

01:43:05.679 --> 01:43:06.914
COMPETE AGAINST THEM.

01:43:06.980 --> 01:43:09.082
AND CAPITALISM SAY HIS POWER CAN

01:43:09.149 --> 01:43:11.752
AFFECT YOU MORE THAN MOUNTAINS
