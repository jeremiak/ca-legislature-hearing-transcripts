BOTH ON THIS BILL AND THE

00:13:20.533 --> 00:13:21.000
SENATE HOUSING PACKAGE IN

00:13:21.066 --> 00:13:23.302
GENERAL. AS WE ALL KNOW HOUSING

00:13:23.369 --> 00:13:25.905
AFFORDABILITY AND ACCESSIBILITY

00:13:25.971 --> 00:13:26.939
CONTINUE TO BE AMONG

00:13:27.006 --> 00:13:28.574
CALIFORNIA'S MOST PRESSING

00:13:28.641 --> 00:13:30.676
ISSUES ALTHOUGH THERE ARE MANY

00:13:30.743 --> 00:13:32.545
CAUSES OF THE HOUSING CRISIS I

00:13:32.611 --> 00:13:33.679
HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT

00:13:33.746 --> 00:13:35.848
REGULATORY CONSTRAINTS SOME OF

00:13:35.915 --> 00:13:37.483
WHICH CLEANERS HAVE CREATED

00:13:37.550 --> 00:13:39.585
QUITE A PART. FOR EXAMPLE UNDER

00:13:39.652 --> 00:13:41.453
CURRENT LAW THE MAJORITY OF

00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:43.656
RESIDENTIAL AREAS CAN ONLY BE

00:13:43.722 --> 00:13:46.659
USED TO CREATE SINGLE FAMILY

00:13:46.725 --> 00:13:47.726
DWELLINGS. OBVIOUSLY THIS

00:13:47.793 --> 00:13:49.595
LIMITS HOUSING SUPPLY BUT IT

00:13:49.662 --> 00:13:50.996
ALSO EXCLUDES LOWER INCOME

00:13:51.063 --> 00:13:52.631
HOUSEHOLDS FROM HOUSING AND

00:13:52.698 --> 00:13:54.266
THIS DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTS

00:13:54.333 --> 00:13:56.669
MINORITY COMMUNITIES. SB NINE

00:13:56.735 --> 00:13:58.137
CAN BE PART OF THE EFFORT TO

00:13:58.204 --> 00:13:59.738
EXPAND HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES

00:13:59.805 --> 00:14:02.141
FOR ALL. I WANT TO BE CLEAR

00:14:02.208 --> 00:14:04.243
THAT SB NINE DOES NOT PROHIBIT

00:14:04.310 --> 00:14:06.679
SINGLE FAMILY HOMES OR ZONING

00:14:06.745 --> 00:14:07.980
IT SIMPLY PROVIDES THAT IN

00:14:08.047 --> 00:14:09.982
THOSE AREAS PROPERTY OWNERS

00:14:10.049 --> 00:14:11.951
MUST ALSO BE ALLOWED TO CREATE

00:14:12.017 --> 00:14:13.852
SMALL MULTI FAMILY HOUSING

00:14:13.919 --> 00:14:16.322
OPTIONS. SB NINE CREATE A BY

00:14:16.388 --> 00:14:18.057
RIGHT MINISTERIAL APPROVAL

00:14:18.123 --> 00:14:20.693
PROCESS FOR THE CREATION OF TWO

00:14:20.759 --> 00:14:22.394
TO FOUR HOMES IN SINGLE FAMILY

00:14:22.461 --> 00:14:24.396
DOLLAR. IT ALLOWS PARCEL MAPS

00:14:24.463 --> 00:14:26.498
THEY CREATE TWO LOTS FROM ONE

00:14:26.565 --> 00:14:28.567
AND PERMITS THEM TO HOMES PER

00:14:28.634 --> 00:14:32.171
LOCK. SHE LIVES WITH TWO HOMES

00:14:32.238 --> 00:14:34.773
AT EACH DATA SET AB YOU LAWS

00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:36.875
ALREADY ALLOW UP TO THREE UNITS

00:14:36.942 --> 00:14:38.377
PER LOT SO THIS IS ONLY AN

00:14:38.444 --> 00:14:41.247
INCREMENTAL CHANGE IN INTENSITY

00:14:41.313 --> 00:14:42.982
BUT THE PARCEL MAP PROVISIONS.

00:14:43.048 --> 00:14:45.084
ALLOW NEW HOMES TO BE SOLD

00:14:45.150 --> 00:14:46.619
WHICH CAN HELP CREATE HOME

00:14:46.685 --> 00:14:48.387
OWNERSHIP OPPORTUNITIES BUT ARE

00:14:48.454 --> 00:14:49.855
NOT ALWAYS AVAILABLE UNDER

00:14:49.922 --> 00:14:54.159
OTHER HOUSING. PRODUCTION AND

00:14:54.226 --> 00:14:55.160
STREAMLINING BILLS. I DON'T

00:14:55.227 --> 00:14:56.662
ALTHOUGH THE APPROVAL IS IN.

00:14:56.729 --> 00:14:57.963
THE MAJORITY OBJECTIVE PLANNING

00:14:58.030 --> 00:14:59.598
STANDARDS WILL CONTINUE TO

00:14:59.665 --> 00:15:01.667
APPLY TO NEW DEVELOPMENT SB

00:15:01.734 --> 00:15:02.901
NINE EVEN INCLUDES A SEQUEL

00:15:02.968 --> 00:15:04.770
EXEMPTION FOR THE ADOPTION OF

00:15:04.837 --> 00:15:06.538
NEW IMPLEMENTING REGULATIONS.

00:15:06.605 --> 00:15:08.907
AND THIS APPROACH WILL HELP

00:15:08.974 --> 00:15:09.408
BALANCE STATE AND LOCAL

00:15:09.475 --> 00:15:11.443
INTEREST. SB NINE DEFINES

00:15:11.510 --> 00:15:13.379
MINIMUM PERFORMANCE TARGETS

00:15:13.445 --> 00:15:15.114
THAT APPLY STATEWIDE BUT IT

00:15:15.180 --> 00:15:16.815
LEAVES ROOM FOR LOCAL PLANNERS

00:15:16.882 --> 00:15:18.884
TO DEFINE AND APPLY CONTEXT

00:15:18.951 --> 00:15:20.719
SPECIFIC STANDARDS FOR THOSE

00:15:20.786 --> 00:15:22.321
TWO TO FOUR UNITS PER LOT.

00:15:22.388 --> 00:15:24.356
FINALLY IN CONCLUSION OUR HOPE

00:15:24.423 --> 00:15:25.758
IS THAT INCREASING HOUSING

00:15:25.824 --> 00:15:27.459

WILL MAKE CALIFORNIA

00:15:28.727 --> 00:15:30.362
COMMUNITIES MORE INCLUSIVE. BUT

00:15:30.429 --> 00:15:31.797
THIS CANNOT COME AT THE COST OF

00:15:31.864 --> 00:15:33.165

00:58:08.284 --> 00:58:09.752
MEASURE AS IT NOW HAS BEEN

00:58:09.819 --> 00:58:10.753
AMENDED AND DISCUSSED AND

00:58:10.820 --> 00:58:12.355
AMENDED DISCUSSION AMENDED

00:58:12.422 --> 00:58:13.957
DISCUSSED AS TO WHERE WE ARE

00:58:14.023 --> 00:58:17.460
TODAY HE'S ONE. WE GO FROM

CURRENT LOT TO. THAT THE LOT

00:58:22.098 --> 00:58:23.666
CAN BE LOT SPLIT BECAUSE WE

00:58:23.733 --> 00:58:25.034
DON'T HAVE THAT BEFORE BY RIGHT

00:58:25.101 --> 00:58:26.302
THAT HE COULD HAVE A LOT SPLIT

00:58:26.369 --> 00:58:27.437
AS LONG AS YOU MEET THESE

00:58:27.503 --> 00:58:29.873

REQUIREMENTS TO FOUR FEET

00:58:34.143 --> 00:58:35.511
BECAUSE IN MY COMMUNITIES I

00:58:35.578 --> 00:58:37.547
HAVE FIVE ON THE SIDE AND

00:58:37.614 --> 00:58:38.348
FIFTEEN IN THE FRONT BUT YOU

00:58:38.414 --> 00:58:40.149
CAN GO TO FOR SO IT'S IN THE

00:58:40.216 --> 00:58:41.718
SIDE CHICK IT'S REDUCED BY ONE

00:58:41.784 --> 00:58:43.319
FOOT THOSE ARE. THE PRINCIPLE

00:58:43.386 --> 00:58:45.488
CHANGES IN ADDITION THE THING

00:58:45.555 --> 00:58:46.689
THAT PORTANTINO CENTER

00:58:46.756 --> 00:58:48.391
PORTANTINO AND I WERE CONCERNED

00:58:48.458 --> 00:58:49.158
ABOUT THAT I BELIEVE HAVE BEEN

00:58:49.225 --> 00:58:50.894
ADDRESSED HERE. IS THIS

00:58:50.960 --> 00:58:52.695
CORPORATIZATION THAT

00:58:52.762 --> 00:58:53.730
FUNDAMENTALLY WAS MENTIONED IN

00:58:53.796 --> 00:58:56.666
THE- THE PROPONENTS OF THIS

00:58:56.733 --> 00:58:59.435
LIKE WELL TO QUOTE DOWN CAN'T.

00:58:59.502 --> 00:59:01.137
YOU CANNOT CHANGE THE GOOD THE

00:59:01.204 --> 00:59:02.672
COSTS ARE COULD NOT COME AT THE

00:59:02.739 --> 00:59:04.841
COST OF DESTABILISING EXISTING

00:59:04.908 --> 00:59:06.910
NEIGHBORHOODS SO THE CONCERN

00:59:06.976 --> 00:59:08.845
AND A COUPLE OF THE OPPONENTS I

00:59:08.912 --> 00:59:10.613
LISTENED TO THE- OPPOSITION.

00:59:10.680 --> 00:59:11.481
WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT

00:59:11.547 --> 00:59:12.782
DEVELOPERS CORPORATE TIES IN

00:59:12.849 --> 00:59:14.817
THEIR COMMUNITY AND THAT I READ

00:59:14.884 --> 00:59:15.785
HERE I COULD GO TO THE

00:59:15.852 --> 00:59:18.121
CITATION. THAT THE PERSON HAS

00:59:18.187 --> 00:59:22.992
TO OWN ONE OF THE PROPERTIES.

00:59:23.059 --> 00:59:23.559
HAVE TO BE OWNER OCCUPIED IS

00:59:23.626 --> 00:59:24.027
THAT CORRECT. THE NEW

00:59:24.093 --> 00:59:24.627
AMENDMENTS PROVIDE. A COUNCIL

00:59:24.694 --> 00:59:26.296
OR BOARD OF SUPERVISORS TO PUT

00:59:26.362 --> 00:59:28.031
AN OWNERSHIP CLAUSE IN

00:59:28.097 --> 00:59:30.033
ORDINANCE INTO PLACE YOUR 100%

00:59:30.099 --> 00:59:31.501
CORRECT OKAY AND THEN IN

00:59:31.567 --> 00:59:33.703
ADDITION. THE OTHER ISSUE WAS

00:59:33.770 --> 00:59:35.305
WHEN WE LOOKED AT S. B. FIFTY

00:59:35.371 --> 00:59:38.141

SENATOR ALSO REPRESENTS. YOU

00:59:47.951 --> 00:59:49.185
COULD HAVE HAD IF YOU'RE WITHIN

00:59:49.252 --> 00:59:50.753
A QUARTER OF A MILE OF THE

00:59:50.820 --> 00:59:53.022
MAJOR TRANSIT STOP A FIFTY FIVE

STORAGE UNIT. WHICH IS NO

00:59:56.459 --> 00:59:57.660
LONGER THE CASE UNDER THIS BILL

00:59:57.727 --> 00:59:59.896
IS THAT FAIR TOSAY. TO SAY AND

00:59:59.963 --> 01:00:00.930
IT'S NOT JUST A MAJOR

01:00:00.997 --> 01:00:03.066
TRANSISTOR UNDER SB FIFTY IT

01:00:03.132 --> 01:00:04.600
WAS ALSO GOING TO BE A BUS STOP

01:00:04.667 --> 01:00:06.536
ORIGINALLY SO. YOU'RE

01:00:06.602 --> 01:00:07.937
ABSOLUTELY RIGHT THERE IS NO

01:00:08.004 --> 01:00:09.706
LINK TO ANY TRANSIT IN THIS

01:00:09.772 --> 01:00:11.474
BILL. OKAY A COUPLE MORE

APOLOGIST SO MUCH WITH THIS IS

01:00:13.076 --> 01:00:14.644
IT REALLY IMPORTANT TO THE

01:00:14.711 --> 01:00:16.379
COMMUNITIES I REPRESENT I DON'T

01:00:16.446 --> 01:00:18.314
SPEND MUCH TIME ON THE STUFF.

01:00:18.381 --> 01:00:20.016
BUT THIS IS SOMETHING IS REALLY

01:00:20.083 --> 01:00:21.351
REALLY IMPORTANT TO ME ON THESE

01:00:21.417 --> 01:00:24.687
ISSUES. SO WITH RESPECT TO THE

01:00:24.754 --> 01:00:26.456
POWER IN THIS TO THIS ISSUE

01:00:26.522 --> 01:00:27.557
THAT WE'VE BEEN DISCUSSING AND

01:00:27.623 --> 01:00:28.524
WE'VE DEALT WITH THIS ON SO

01:00:28.591 --> 01:00:29.892
MANY ISSUES OVER THE YEARS I

01:00:29.959 --> 01:00:30.927
WAS ASKING THE NEIGHBORHOOD

01:00:30.994 --> 01:00:32.428
COUNCIL ONCE YOU SUPPORT LOCAL

01:00:32.495 --> 01:00:34.731
CONTROL. BUT I DO ACCEPT THEIR

01:00:34.797 --> 01:00:35.865
CERTAIN ISSUES OF STATEWIDE

01:00:35.932 --> 01:00:37.266
CONCERN YOU CAN'T DISCRIMINATE

01:00:37.333 --> 01:00:39.268
LOCALLY AND SAY WELL. I'M NOT

01:00:39.335 --> 01:00:40.169
GOING TO THAT AND WE'VE HAD

01:00:40.236 --> 01:00:41.337
THESE ISSUES DIFFERENT

01:00:41.404 --> 01:00:42.372
COMMUNITIES HAVE RESPONDED TO

01:00:42.438 --> 01:00:43.806
IT DIFFERENTLY WE'RE TRYING TO

01:00:43.873 --> 01:00:45.842
MEET HOUSING REQUIREMENTS. AND

01:00:45.908 --> 01:00:47.076
WE SET UP A HOUSING ELEMENT

01:00:47.143 --> 01:00:49.278
MANY DECADES AGO AND IT HASN'T

01:00:49.345 --> 01:00:50.980
WORKED VERY WELL. AND SO WE'VE

01:00:51.047 --> 01:00:52.315
BEEN GRAPPLING WITH THIS THE

01:00:52.382 --> 01:00:53.282
GOVERNOR CAME UP WITH AN IDEA

01:00:53.349 --> 01:00:54.250
IS WE'RE GONNA TAKE YOUR

01:00:54.317 --> 01:00:55.451
TRANSIT FUNDS IF YOU DON'T MEET

01:00:55.518 --> 01:00:57.587
OR WORK AT ALL. GREAT ABILITY

01:00:57.653 --> 01:00:58.955
FOR A COURT TO CREATE AN ORDER

01:00:59.022 --> 01:01:01.057
WE'VE BEEN DEBATING. HOW TO WE

01:01:01.124 --> 01:01:02.625
QUITE A WE DEAL WITH THIS

01:01:02.692 --> 01:01:04.460
DYNAMIC BETWEEN TRYING TO

01:01:04.527 --> 01:01:05.528
CREATE HOUSING WHICH IS OUR

01:01:05.595 --> 01:01:07.830
OBLIGATION TO STATE. AND THE

01:01:07.897 --> 01:01:09.665
IMPORTANT POWER OF THE LOCALS.

01:01:09.732 --> 01:01:11.167
TO ME WHEN I WHEN I LOOK AT

01:01:11.234 --> 01:01:12.702
THIS THING THE BIG ISSUE THAT.

01:01:12.769 --> 01:01:17.807
I SEE REMAINING. IN TERMS OF

01:01:17.874 --> 01:01:18.474
THAT BECAUSE- YOU KNOW THERE IS.

01:01:18.541 --> 01:01:19.642
FROM GUY. IN THIS THING. AND

01:01:19.709 --> 01:01:22.478
BUT BUT FOR ME IT'S- BUT WHAT I

01:01:22.545 --> 01:01:24.447
FIND IN THE POINT WAS RAISED

01:01:24.514 --> 01:01:25.915
THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE STILL

01:01:25.982 --> 01:01:27.216
ADDITIONAL CLARIFICATION ON

01:01:27.283 --> 01:01:29.752
THIS. IS THE ISSUE OF THE FOOT

01:01:29.819 --> 01:01:31.721
PRINT THE ISSUE OF THE ENVELOPE

01:01:31.788 --> 01:01:32.922
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN IS THAT

01:01:32.989 --> 01:01:35.191
SQUARE FOOTAGE OF THE PROPERTY

01:01:35.258 --> 01:01:36.526
SO NOW I'M IN A SITUATION

01:01:36.592 --> 01:01:38.928
WHERE. I HAVE MY PROPERTY MY

01:01:38.995 --> 01:01:40.797
HOUSE LET'S ASSUME IT'S TEN

01:01:40.863 --> 01:01:41.364
THOUSAND SQUARE FEET IS THE

01:01:41.431 --> 01:01:43.166
LAND OF I'M ON. AND I COULD

01:01:43.232 --> 01:01:45.368
SPLIT IT FOUR THOUSAND SIX

01:01:45.435 --> 01:01:46.702
THOUSAND OR WHATEVER IT MAY BE

01:01:46.769 --> 01:01:47.804
AND THE SECOND ONE I NOW MAKE A

01:01:47.870 --> 01:01:50.139
LOT THAT I COULD SELL

01:01:50.206 --> 01:01:50.706
SEPARATELY BECAUSE IT'S NOW

01:01:50.773 --> 01:01:52.175
SEPARATE PARTIAL RIGHT. UNDER

01:01:52.241 --> 01:01:54.277
THE CURRENT ENVELOPE TERM. OR

01:01:54.343 --> 01:01:56.579
FOOT PRINT TERM. MATCHES TO MY

01:01:56.646 --> 01:01:58.448
HOUSE FOR EASE OF EXAMPLES TWO

01:01:58.514 --> 01:02:00.416
THOUSAND SQUARE FEET. SO AM I

01:02:00.483 --> 01:02:01.751
LIMITED IN THE BUILDING OF A

01:02:01.818 --> 01:02:03.119
NEW PROPERTY AND I DON'T KNOW

01:02:03.186 --> 01:02:03.786
THE ANSWER TO THIS I'M NOT SURE

01:02:03.853 --> 01:02:05.588
YOU DO BUT I. THE BOTTOM LINE

01:02:05.655 --> 01:02:06.789
IS I WANT TO CONTINUE TO WORK

01:02:06.856 --> 01:02:08.758
ON THIS. TO TWO THOUSAND SQUARE

01:02:08.825 --> 01:02:10.259
FEET OF NEW STRUCTURE OR IF THE

01:02:10.326 --> 01:02:13.496
FOOTPRINT IS. TEN BY TEN JUST

01:02:13.563 --> 01:02:15.698
FOR EASE OF EXAMPLE. COULD I GO

01:02:15.765 --> 01:02:17.166
THREE STORIES HIGH ASSUMING THE

01:02:17.233 --> 01:02:18.601
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ALLOWED ME.

01:02:18.668 --> 01:02:21.270
THAT ACTUALLY GO. THREE HUNDRED

01:02:21.337 --> 01:02:22.071
SQUARE FEET INSTEAD OF A

01:02:22.138 --> 01:02:23.206
HUNDRED IF IT WAS TEN BY TEN.

01:02:23.272 --> 01:02:24.974
RIGHT WATER ONE OF THOSE

01:02:25.041 --> 01:02:26.576
FACTORS IN DETERMINING THE

01:02:26.642 --> 01:02:28.578
DEFINITION. BETWEEN SQUARE

01:02:28.644 --> 01:02:31.080
FOOTAGE. IN ENVELOPE OR

01:02:31.147 --> 01:02:32.415
FOOTPRINT DO YOU HAVE ANY HELP

01:02:32.482 --> 01:02:33.883
YOU CAN HELP ME ON THAT YEAH.

01:02:33.950 --> 01:02:35.418
FIRST AND FOREMOST I THINK IT'S

01:02:35.485 --> 01:02:36.752
REALLY CRITICAL TO BE ABLE TO

01:02:36.819 --> 01:02:39.055
DEFINE. WHAT IS STILL IN PLACE

01:02:39.122 --> 01:02:40.923
WITH THIS BILL. THERE'S BEEN

01:02:40.990 --> 01:02:43.493
SOME CONCERN. THAT FLOOR AREA

01:02:43.559 --> 01:02:45.228
RATIO WOULD RISE FOR NOW. SOME

01:02:45.294 --> 01:02:46.562
CONCERN THAT HEIGHT LIMITS

01:02:46.629 --> 01:02:48.097
WOULD BE RIGHT TURN OUT A LOT

01:02:48.164 --> 01:02:49.832
OF CONCERN IT BACKS UP. IT ALL

01:02:49.899 --> 01:02:53.035
REMAINS. IT ALL REMAINS. SO I'M

01:02:53.102 --> 01:02:55.438
GONNA GIVE AN EXAMPLE OKAY- MY

01:02:55.505 --> 01:02:57.173
NEIGHBORHOOD. WE LIVE ON A

01:02:57.240 --> 01:03:01.043

01:03:01.110 --> 01:03:03.012
THIS BILL- IN THE CITY THAT I

01:03:03.079 --> 01:03:05.515
LIVE IN. FOR DUPLEX. YOU COULD

01:03:05.581 --> 01:03:07.917
NOT BUILD A THREE STORY DUPLEX

01:03:07.984 --> 01:03:11.554
IT WOULD BE OUTSIDE OF THE NORM

01:03:11.621 --> 01:03:12.121
THAT WOULD BE ALLOWED UNDER

01:03:12.188 --> 01:03:14.757
ZONING. IN THE CITY THEY RESIDE

01:03:14.824 --> 01:03:17.326
IN SO IF YOU CAN ESSENTIALLY

01:03:17.393 --> 01:03:19.362
BUILD A SINGLE FAMILY HOME

01:03:19.428 --> 01:03:21.597
BEHIND YOUR HOME THAT YOU'RE

BUILD A DUPLEX BOTTOM LINE

01:03:32.942 --> 01:03:34.610
CORRECT. AND THE LAST PIECE OF

01:03:34.677 --> 01:03:37.747
SPACE LOCAL REQUIREMENTS STILL

01:03:37.813 --> 01:03:41.484

DUPLEX FROM BEING BUILT. FLOOR

01:03:46.722 --> 01:03:48.758
AREA RATIO. SET BACK HEIGHT

01:03:48.824 --> 01:03:50.893
REQUIREMENTS ALSO APPLIES IN

MEMBERS MOVING TO SPEND TO

01:04:42.778 --> 01:04:45.248
TASTIC. SO I DON'T THINK IT WAS

01:04:45.314 --> 01:04:46.148
COMPLAINING ABOUT THE EIGHTY

01:04:46.215 --> 01:04:48.451
USE THE ISSUE IS IF IT IS A

01:04:48.517 --> 01:04:49.852
REAL FEAR OF CORPORATE IS ATION

01:04:49.919 --> 01:04:51.254
AND CHANGING THE CHARACTER OF A

01:04:51.320 --> 01:04:52.955
SINGLE FAMILY NEIGHBORHOOD AND

REBUILD OF A SUBSTANTIAL TEAR

01:05:11.507 --> 01:05:14.143
DOWN OR ARE THEY LIMITED JUST

01:05:14.210 --> 01:05:15.778
BY THE ENVELOPE AND THEN OKAY

01:05:15.845 --> 01:05:18.681
THE LOCAL ORDINANCES WILL WILL-

01:05:18.748 --> 01:05:20.182
REGULATE THE HEIGHT ACTUALLY

01:05:20.249 --> 01:05:20.816
SOME GUIDANCE ON THAT

01:05:20.883 --> 01:05:22.551
COUNCILMAN CLEAR ABOUT THAT AND

GOOD MR MAJORITY LEADER SO THE

01:05:26.055 --> 01:05:28.324
POSITIVE PIECE OF THIS BILL. IT

01:05:28.391 --> 01:05:30.459
STILL MAINTAINS LOCAL CONTROL

01:05:30.526 --> 01:05:31.394
FOR EXAMPLE AND I DON'T MEAN TO

01:05:31.460 --> 01:05:33.095
BE SQUISHY BUT IT'S GOING TO BE

01:05:33.162 --> 01:05:35.064
DEPENDENT ON THE CITY OR COUNTY

01:05:35.131 --> 01:05:41.337
ORDINANCE SO FOR EXAMPLE. IF

01:05:41.404 --> 01:05:42.171
THE CITY. ALLOWS FOR THAT

01:05:42.238 --> 01:05:44.340
SINGLE FOR HOME- DO ABLE TO BE

01:05:44.407 --> 01:05:45.241
BUILT FOR A DUPLEX BE ABLE TO

01:05:45.308 --> 01:05:47.209
BE BUILT. THAT CITY OR COUNTY

01:05:47.276 --> 01:05:50.313
CAN IMPOSE REQUIREMENTS AS LONG

01:05:50.379 --> 01:05:53.749
AS- AS LONG AS IT DOESN'T

01:05:53.816 --> 01:05:54.684
PRECLUDE THE BUILDING OF TWO

01:05:54.750 --> 01:05:57.186
TWO UNITS. SO IT'S UP TO THE

01:05:57.253 --> 01:05:59.989
CITY. WHICH IS THE POSITIVE

01:06:00.056 --> 01:06:02.091
PIECE OF THIS BILL. SO THEY

01:06:02.158 --> 01:06:03.993
COULD DO HI RESTRICTIONS THE

01:06:04.060 --> 01:06:04.460
GUY WAS TALKING

01:06:04.527 --> 01:06:05.761
AMERISOURCEBERGEN BUT THIS IT

01:06:05.828 --> 01:06:06.996
IS IT WAS YOU KNOW GATHERING

01:06:07.063 --> 01:06:08.531
DATA AND TRYING TO GET YOU HELP

01:06:08.597 --> 01:06:10.366
ME UNDERSTAND THIS BETTER AND

01:06:10.433 --> 01:06:11.567
HE WAS SAYING YOU KNOW ONE OF

01:06:11.634 --> 01:06:12.201
THE THINGS THAT THEY'RE DOING

01:06:12.268 --> 01:06:14.036
IS LIMITING HEIGHT RESTRICTIONS

01:06:14.103 --> 01:06:15.271
IN THEIR CITY THAT THEY'RE

01:06:15.338 --> 01:06:16.305
LIMITING THE DESIGN

01:06:16.372 --> 01:06:17.506
RESTRICTIONS YOU CAN'T BUILD A

01:06:17.573 --> 01:06:18.941
MONSTROSITY BEHIND YOUR HOUSE

01:06:19.008 --> 01:06:19.642
THAT LOOKS COMPLETELY

01:06:19.709 --> 01:06:20.576
DIFFERENT- HOUSE THAT HAS TO BE

01:06:20.643 --> 01:06:22.078
CONSISTENT WITH THE DESIGN SO

01:06:22.144 --> 01:06:24.013
IT DOESN'T UPSET THE- INTEGRITY

01:06:24.080 --> 01:06:25.214
OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD TRYING TO

01:06:25.281 --> 01:06:25.948
FIGURE OUT STANDARDS WHAT

01:06:26.015 --> 01:06:27.683
YOU'RE TELLING ME. IS THAT YOUR

01:06:27.750 --> 01:06:29.151
INTERPRETATION OF THIS BILL IS

01:06:29.218 --> 01:06:30.686
THE DATA AUTHORITY STILL RESTS

01:06:30.753 --> 01:06:31.520
WITH THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT AS

01:06:31.587 --> 01:06:33.923
LONG AS THE BOTTOM LINE IS THE

01:06:33.989 --> 01:06:36.726
THEY HAVE NO ABILITY TO SAY NO

01:06:36.792 --> 01:06:38.861
TO A DUPLEX BIG THAT YOU CAN'T

01:06:38.928 --> 01:06:41.597
HAVE. YOU COULD YOU CAN'T GO

01:06:41.664 --> 01:06:43.032
PAST FOUR SO IF YOU HAVE A OP

01:06:43.099 --> 01:06:44.266
YOU'RE SINGLE FAMILY HOME WITH

01:06:44.333 --> 01:06:46.068
THE JUNIOR EIGHTY YOU AND THEN

01:06:46.135 --> 01:06:47.870
YOU DO A LOT SPLIT YOUR DUPLEX

01:06:47.937 --> 01:06:50.239
IN THE BACK THAT'S IT AND THAT

01:06:50.306 --> 01:06:53.709
TO ME IS CLEAR BECAUSE I SAW

01:06:53.776 --> 01:06:54.210
THAT THERE WAS A LACK OF

01:06:54.276 --> 01:06:54.744
CLARITY BEFORE. IT'S BEEN

01:06:54.810 --> 01:06:55.277
RAISED BY PEOPLE FROM THE

01:06:55.344 --> 01:06:58.614
COMMUNITY. WE AGREED WITH THAT

01:06:58.681 --> 01:06:59.982
AND FIXED IT YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY

01:07:00.049 --> 01:07:03.119
RIGHT ALSO- DESIGN RESTRICTIONS

01:07:03.185 --> 01:07:05.988
ON THESE UNITS STILL APPLY OKAY

01:07:06.055 --> 01:07:08.457
SO IT'S COOKED IN BUILT INTO

01:07:08.524 --> 01:07:12.228
THIS BILL. ONLY TWO PER PARCEL.

01:07:12.294 --> 01:07:14.230
A TOTAL OF FOUR SO IF I'M USING

01:07:14.296 --> 01:07:16.298
MY EXAMPLE IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD

01:07:16.365 --> 01:07:18.601
RIGHT. I COULD TRANSITION ONE

01:07:18.667 --> 01:07:20.302
TIME MY SINGLE FAMILY TWO

01:07:20.369 --> 01:07:23.005
DUPLEX. AND I COULD PUT TWO

01:07:23.072 --> 01:07:24.473
UNITS BEHIND MY HOME IF I

01:07:24.540 --> 01:07:27.543
WANTED TO. IN FACT ALL THE SAME

01:07:27.610 --> 01:07:31.614
IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD- WE HAVE

01:07:31.680 --> 01:07:34.350
DUPLEXES IN EIGHTY USE GT USE

01:07:34.417 --> 01:07:36.585
ALL THROUGHOUT AND IT HAS BEEN

01:07:36.652 --> 01:07:39.355
DONE OVER TIME BUT- I JUST

01:07:39.422 --> 01:07:41.257
WANTED TO SHARE THAT THE DESIGN

01:07:41.323 --> 01:07:44.794
REVIEW. IN DESIGN RESTRICTIONS

01:07:44.860 --> 01:07:46.996
ALL STILL APPLY WITH YOUR CITY

01:07:47.062 --> 01:07:49.498
AND THAT'S THE POWERFUL PIECE

01:07:49.565 --> 01:07:52.568
OF THIS BILL. OKAY SO THIS LAST

01:07:52.635 --> 01:07:53.936
POINT I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR

01:07:54.003 --> 01:07:55.438
PATIENCE AND ALL THIS BECAUSE

01:07:55.504 --> 01:07:56.572
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IS JUST

01:07:56.639 --> 01:07:58.073
TAKE AN EXTRAORDINARY AMOUNT OF

01:07:58.140 --> 01:07:58.641
TIME AND ATTENTION THE

01:07:58.707 --> 01:08:00.376
COMMITTEES ARE PRESENT. IN

01:08:00.443 --> 01:08:02.878
TRYING TO. BRING THEIR POINT OF

01:08:02.945 --> 01:08:05.414
VIEW TO THIS LEGISLATURE AND

01:08:05.481 --> 01:08:06.182
THE FRUSTRATIONS THAT THEY'VE

01:08:06.248 --> 01:08:08.317
EXPRESSED AND IT'S OFTEN IT'S

01:08:08.384 --> 01:08:10.486
HARDER HERE'S THE AUTHOR OF SB

01:08:10.553 --> 01:08:11.821
FIFTY THAT YOU KNOW MISTER

01:08:11.887 --> 01:08:13.589
WINNER JUST WALKED IN AND YOU

01:08:13.656 --> 01:08:14.924
KNOW EVERYBODY STILL SEES THIS

01:08:14.990 --> 01:08:16.859
IS THAT AND IT'S COMPLETELY

01:08:16.926 --> 01:08:19.628
COMPLETELY DIFFERENT. OKAY I'M

01:08:19.695 --> 01:08:21.497
GOING TO SUPPORT THIS TODAY

01:08:21.564 --> 01:08:22.965
WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT

01:08:23.032 --> 01:08:24.433
WHAT WE JUST TALKED ABOUT HERE

01:08:24.500 --> 01:08:25.701
PARTICULAR SQUARE FOOTAGE

01:08:25.768 --> 01:08:28.337
VERSUS. VERSUS ENVELOPE IN THE

01:08:28.404 --> 01:08:29.872
LIKE WE GET BUT I'M JUST WANNA

01:08:29.939 --> 01:08:31.407
MAKE SURE WE HAVE CLARITY ON

01:08:31.474 --> 01:08:32.975
THAT BECAUSE THERE'S SO MANY

01:08:33.042 --> 01:08:34.243
LAND USE LAWYERS AND OTHER

01:08:34.310 --> 01:08:36.545
PEOPLE WHO HAVE FORTY OPINIONS

01:08:36.612 --> 01:08:38.147
AND THEY'RE CRAWLING ALL OVER

01:08:38.214 --> 01:08:40.249
THIS AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE.

01:08:40.316 --> 01:08:42.618
THAT THIS UNDERSTANDING THAT IT

01:08:42.685 --> 01:08:43.486
GOES FROM THREE TO FOUR WHICH I

01:08:43.552 --> 01:08:45.254
KNOW IT DOES BUT THE BIG ISSUE

01:08:45.321 --> 01:08:46.922
IS IF THERE'S A TEARDOWN IS THE

01:08:46.989 --> 01:08:48.424
BIG QUESTION ARE SUBSTANTIAL

01:08:48.491 --> 01:08:50.092
TEAR DOWN WHAT IS THAT

01:08:50.159 --> 01:08:51.527
REPLACEMENT LOOK LIKE AND WHAT

01:08:51.594 --> 01:08:52.862
ARE THE LIMIATIONS THAT ARE

01:08:52.928 --> 01:08:54.330
IMPOSED UPON LOCAL GOVERNMENT

01:08:54.396 --> 01:08:55.498
WITH RESPECT TO THAT TURNED

01:08:55.564 --> 01:08:57.299
OUT. THAT TO ME IS THE CRUX OF

01:08:57.366 --> 01:08:59.835
THE REMAINING QUESTION THAT

01:08:59.902 --> 01:09:01.604
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT I KNOW A

01:09:01.670 --> 01:09:02.171
LOT OF PEOPLE ARE RAISE THE

01:09:02.238 --> 01:09:03.639
QUESTION ABOUT AFFORDABLE

01:09:03.706 --> 01:09:04.974
HOUSING BUT I WOULD SUGGEST

01:09:05.040 --> 01:09:06.308
THAT THERE ARE MANY OTHER

01:09:06.375 --> 01:09:07.676
AVENUES THAT HAVE BEEN

01:09:07.743 --> 01:09:09.245
RESPONSIBLY TAKEN WITH RESPECT

01:09:09.311 --> 01:09:11.013
TO THIS LEGISLATURE THAT'S

01:09:11.080 --> 01:09:11.714
GOING TO. DEAL WITH THE ISSUE

01:09:11.780 --> 01:09:14.683
OF PEOPLE THAT ARE YOU KNOW AND-

01:09:14.750 --> 01:09:16.385
CHALLENGING SITUATIONS WITH

01:09:16.452 --> 01:09:17.786
RESPECT AFFORDABILITY AND WILL

01:09:17.853 --> 01:09:19.088
BE DEALING WITH THAT THE VERY

01:09:19.154 --> 01:09:21.056
SIGNIFICANT HUESO WITH THAT I

01:09:21.123 --> 01:09:23.192
THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN

01:09:23.259 --> 01:09:25.094
FOR BEING SO PATIENT. MR

01:09:25.160 --> 01:09:26.095
MAJORITY LEADER LOOK I THINK

01:09:26.161 --> 01:09:27.563
THE MAJORITY LEADER BRINGS UP

01:09:27.630 --> 01:09:31.901
SOME. VERY VALID POINTS TODAY.

01:09:31.967 --> 01:09:33.235
BUT I WANNA RE. WHERE WE WERE

01:09:33.302 --> 01:09:35.738
IN WHERE THIS BILL WOULD GO.

01:09:35.804 --> 01:09:38.340
THE RESTRICTIONS FROM LOCAL

01:09:38.407 --> 01:09:39.975
GOVERNMENT STILL APPLY WITH

01:09:40.042 --> 01:09:42.778
THIS BILL. THE ONLY THING THE

01:09:42.845 --> 01:09:47.716
CITY CAN'T DO IS BAN DUPLEX.

01:09:47.783 --> 01:09:50.619
IT'S ALSO CRITICAL TO SAY RIGHT

01:09:50.686 --> 01:09:53.522
NOW IN STATE LAW YOU CAN HAVE

01:09:53.589 --> 01:09:55.524
THREE UNITS ON YOUR PERSONAL

01:09:55.591 --> 01:09:58.227
SINGLE FAMILY HOME. A JUNIOR

01:09:58.294 --> 01:09:59.662
ACCESSORY DWELLING UNIT AN

01:09:59.728 --> 01:10:02.031
ACCESSORY DWELLING UNITS. THIS

01:10:02.097 --> 01:10:05.801
ONLY ADDS ONE. FLOOR AREA RATIO

01:10:05.868 --> 01:10:08.270
HEIGHT RESTRICTIONS ALONG WITH

01:10:08.337 --> 01:10:10.639
SET BACK STILL APPLIES OTHER

01:10:10.706 --> 01:10:11.340
GUARD RAILS THAT HAVE BEEN

01:10:11.407 --> 01:10:13.709
EMBEDDED IN THIS IS THAT IF AN

01:10:13.776 --> 01:10:15.778
INDIVIDUAL WANTED TO BUY TWO

01:10:15.844 --> 01:10:17.913
PARCELS THAT **** UP AGAINST

01:10:17.980 --> 01:10:20.349
THE PARCEL WE'RE GONNA PUT IN

01:10:20.416 --> 01:10:21.617
EIGHT TWO DUPLEXES YOU CAN'T DO

01:10:21.684 --> 01:10:24.153
THAT. SO THE SPECULATION

01:10:24.219 --> 01:10:26.021
OPPORTUNITY IS TAKEN OUT OF

01:10:26.088 --> 01:10:27.990
THIS BILL AND THE- OTHER REALLY

01:10:28.057 --> 01:10:29.625
IMPORTANT PART OF ALL THIS YOU

01:10:29.692 --> 01:10:31.627
ALL IS THAT THERE IS NOW AN

01:10:31.694 --> 01:10:33.429
ABILITY TO HAVE A HOME

01:10:33.495 --> 01:10:35.664
OWNERSHIP CLIENTS AGAIN THE

01:10:35.731 --> 01:10:37.666
PROGRAM IS AND REALLY FOCUS ON

01:10:37.733 --> 01:10:40.235
LOCAL CONTROL. IF THE CITY

01:10:40.302 --> 01:10:41.570
DECIDES TO PUT A HOME OWNERSHIP

01:10:41.637 --> 01:10:43.505
BECAUSE INTO THE BILL BY

01:10:43.572 --> 01:10:45.207
PASSING ORDINANCE THEY CAN DO

01:10:45.274 --> 01:10:47.209
IT THIS BILL NOW ALLOWS THEM

01:10:47.276 --> 01:10:48.811
THAT WAS REALLY IMPORTANT TO

01:10:48.877 --> 01:10:51.113
HER TO BE ABLE TO BUILD THAT

01:10:51.180 --> 01:10:53.282
MULTI GENERATIONAL WEALTH. WE

01:10:53.349 --> 01:10:55.484
KNOW RIGHT NOW IN CALIFORNIA

01:10:55.551 --> 01:10:57.353
FOR THOSE HOMEOWNERS THE NUMBER

01:10:57.419 --> 01:10:58.854
ONE MISTAKE THE NUMBER ONE

01:10:58.921 --> 01:11:00.789
INVESTMENT THAT FOLKS HAVE IS

01:11:00.856 --> 01:11:03.058
HOME OWNERSHIP. IN THIS IS

01:11:03.125 --> 01:11:04.660
GOING TO HELP BUILD MULTI

01:11:04.727 --> 01:11:06.462
GENERATIONAL WEALTH IN THE

01:11:06.528 --> 01:11:08.864
STATE THE LAST THING I'LL SAY

01:11:08.931 --> 01:11:10.032
IS THIS LET'S TALK ABOUT

01:11:10.099 --> 01:11:12.968
AFFORDABLE- THEIR BEEN STUDIES

FOUR AND ANOTHER A FEW OF US

02:04:50.549 --> 02:04:51.851
HERE THESE ARE SOME OF THE MOST

02:04:51.917 --> 02:04:53.719
CONTENTIOUS. FIGHTS THAT WE

02:04:53.786 --> 02:04:54.753
WOULD HAVE IN TERMS OF THE

02:04:54.820 --> 02:04:58.591
CITING OF- OF CELL SITES IN

02:04:58.657 --> 02:05:00.993
INTERNET INFRASTRUCTURE- AND WE

02:05:01.060 --> 02:05:04.530
WOULD HAVE APPEALS- AT THE-

02:05:04.597 --> 02:05:05.331
FORTY SUPERVISORS RIGHT SIR WE

02:05:05.397 --> 02:05:07.900
WOULD. I WAS IN VARIOUS

02:05:07.967 --> 02:05:08.934
COMMUNITY MEETINGS WHERE WE

02:05:09.001 --> 02:05:09.869
WILL BING NEIGHBORS TOGETHER

02:05:09.935 --> 02:05:11.070
AND TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'S

02:05:11.136 --> 02:05:12.471
THE PURPOSE CITING SO IT'S NOT

02:05:12.538 --> 02:05:14.773
OUTSIDE OF SOMEONE'S. BEDROOM

02:05:14.840 --> 02:05:16.942
FOR EXAMPLE. WHICH IS ALWAYS

02:05:17.009 --> 02:05:18.611
HARD ISSUES AND IT'S ALSO

02:05:18.677 --> 02:05:20.246
INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE

02:05:20.312 --> 02:05:22.081
THE INTERNET IS AN INTERNET

02:05:22.147 --> 02:05:23.782
BROADBAND ACCESS INTERNET

02:05:23.849 --> 02:05:25.618
ACCESS IS AT THE HEART OF. SO

02:05:25.684 --> 02:05:27.152
MUCH OF MODERN SOCIETY FOR

02:05:27.219 --> 02:05:29.688
BETTER FOR WORSE AND THIS

02:05:29.755 --> 02:05:32.291
PANDEMIC HAS CERTAINLY-

02:05:32.358 --> 02:05:34.994
CERTAINLY- REMINDED US OF THAT

02:05:35.060 --> 02:05:38.864
AND I FEEL VERY FORTUNATE THAT-

02:05:38.931 --> 02:05:41.333
YOU KNOW IN MY- HOME I HAVE

02:05:41.400 --> 02:05:44.003
REALLY YOU KNOW STRONG-

02:05:44.069 --> 02:05:45.571
INTERNET ACCESS AND I DON'T

02:05:45.638 --> 02:05:46.906
KNOW WHAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN

02:05:46.972 --> 02:05:49.541
LIKE HAD I HAD CRUDDY- YOU KNOW

02:05:49.608 --> 02:05:51.343
BROADBAND ACCESS. DURING THIS

02:05:51.410 --> 02:05:52.544
PANDEMIC IN PARTICULAR AND I

02:05:52.611 --> 02:05:54.546
KNOW THAT TRAGICALLY THERE ARE

02:05:54.613 --> 02:05:56.749
A HUGE NUMBER OF CALIFORNIANS

02:05:56.815 --> 02:05:58.851
WHO DO FRANKLY HAVE CRUDDY.

02:05:58.918 --> 02:06:01.654
BROADBAND ACCESS IT IS VERY

02:06:01.720 --> 02:06:03.756
VERY DAMAGING IN TERMS OF

02:06:03.822 --> 02:06:05.524
WHETHER IT'S REMOTE LEARNING

02:06:05.591 --> 02:06:08.294
OR- HELP PEOPLE WORK OR ANY OF

02:06:08.360 --> 02:06:09.628
THE OTHER MANY WAYS OF PEOPLE

02:06:09.695 --> 02:06:11.463
RELY ON THE INTERNET FOR.

02:06:11.530 --> 02:06:13.365
ESSENTIAL SO WE'RE TRYING TO

02:06:13.432 --> 02:06:15.301
STRIKE THIS BALANCE- TO SAY WE

02:06:15.367 --> 02:06:16.669
NEED TO KEEP BUILDING OUT THIS

02:06:16.735 --> 02:06:18.203
INFRASTRUCTURE BECAUSE SO MANY

02:06:18.270 --> 02:06:23.042
SWATHS. OF CALIFORNIA DO HAVE

02:06:23.108 --> 02:06:24.476
BAD ACCESS. WHILE ALSO- YOU

02:06:24.543 --> 02:06:26.211
KNOW- PLACE AND ASCETICS IN

02:06:26.278 --> 02:06:28.547
SAFETY. AND EQUITY AND SO

02:06:28.614 --> 02:06:32.084
FORTH- SO THIS BILL I THINK YOU

02:06:32.151 --> 02:06:34.053
NEED SOME MORE WORK- BUT I

02:06:34.119 --> 02:06:36.522
THINK IT'S HEADED IN A POSITIVE

02:06:36.588 --> 02:06:38.691
DIRECTION- AND I CAN KNOWLEDGE

02:06:38.757 --> 02:06:40.626
OF MY OWN CITY IS OPPOSED TO IT

02:06:40.693 --> 02:06:42.661
I RESPECT THAT BUT I'M GOING TO

02:06:42.728 --> 02:06:43.295
BE SUPPORTING MOVING THIS BILL

02:06:43.362 --> 02:06:45.698
FORWARD TODAY- I DO THINK THAT

02:06:45.764 --> 02:06:46.732
SOME OF THE ENERGY COMMITTEE

02:06:46.799 --> 02:06:48.233
MEMBERS WAS I GUESS WE'RE

02:06:48.300 --> 02:06:49.101
TAKING. OFFICIALLY IN THIS

02:06:49.168 --> 02:06:51.370
COMMITTEE- ARE POSITIVE THAT

02:06:51.437 --> 02:06:53.205
WHEN THIS ONE CENTER HUESO OUT

02:06:53.272 --> 02:06:55.374
OF A MUCH BROADER VERSION OF

02:06:55.441 --> 02:06:57.676
THIS BILL. THREE YEARS AGO. I

02:06:57.743 --> 02:06:59.078
KNOW I AM CENTER MCGUIRE AND

02:06:59.144 --> 02:07:01.113
OTHERS HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT

02:07:01.180 --> 02:07:03.015
LOCAL ABILITY TO MANDATE THE

02:07:03.082 --> 02:07:05.017
RIGHT DESIGN AND AESTHETICS OR

02:07:05.084 --> 02:07:07.353
NOT BEING- DOWNED YOU KNOW IT

02:07:07.419 --> 02:07:08.487

THIS BILL DOES PROVIDE- AND

02:07:18.364 --> 02:07:21.834

DO WE- MAKE SURE THAT. THIS IS

02:07:49.028 --> 02:07:49.828

IN OUR COMMUNITIES BUT- ACCESS

02:11:38.957 --> 02:11:43.095
IS. OF THE THREE THAT I THINK

02:12:07.486 --> 02:12:09.788
A WHOLE LOT MORE BUT EVERY TIME

02:12:09.855 --> 02:12:11.823
THE TECHNOLOGY COMES UP THERE'S

02:12:11.890 --> 02:12:13.759
ALWAYS A DOWNSIDE BECAUSE OF

02:12:13.825 --> 02:12:15.594
THE COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE BEEN

02:12:15.661 --> 02:12:17.929
LEFT OUT OR LEFT BEHIND AND SO

02:12:17.996 --> 02:12:19.998

03:03:05.941 --> 03:03:07.042

LENGTHIER AND MORE EXPENSIVE

03:03:24.626 --> 03:03:26.295

03:03:26.362 --> 03:03:28.464
YOU COULD DO IT. IF THEY COULD

03:03:39.608 --> 03:03:40.275
WELL KNOWN WE HAD LONG

03:03:40.342 --> 03:03:42.044
DISCUSSIONS ON THE SENATOR. YOU

03:03:42.111 --> 03:03:44.546
ARE ONE BRIGHT FELLA. BUT I WAS

03:03:44.613 --> 03:03:47.750
NOT SOMEBODY WHO WAS SUPPORTIVE

03:03:47.816 --> 03:03:51.420
OF- SB FIFTY LAST YEAR AND THE

03:03:51.487 --> 03:03:53.355
REASON I DIDN'T DO IT WAS

03:03:53.422 --> 03:03:55.023
BECAUSE I THOUGHT THAT IT

03:03:55.090 --> 03:03:56.091
DESTROYED AS I SAID IN MY FOR

03:03:56.158 --> 03:03:57.526
STATEMENT SINGLE FAMILY

03:03:57.593 --> 03:03:58.794
NEIGHBORHOODS AND I BELIEVE

03:03:58.861 --> 03:04:02.264
THAT. THERE'S  VALUE TO SINGLE

03:04:02.331 --> 03:04:03.932
FAMILY NEIGHBORHOODS I THINK

03:04:03.999 --> 03:04:05.667
THEY'RE IMPORTANT PEOPLE MAKE

03:04:05.734 --> 03:04:07.002
DECISIONS TO LIVE IN SINGLE

03:04:07.069 --> 03:04:08.837
FAMILY NEIGHBORHOODS. AND I

03:04:08.904 --> 03:04:10.506
THINK THAT ALTHOUGH WE HAVE

03:04:10.572 --> 03:04:12.274
SOMEWHAT OF A CHALLENGE PRETTY

03:04:12.341 --> 03:04:13.675
URGENT CHALLENGE WITH RESPECT

03:04:13.742 --> 03:04:16.078
TO HOUSING SUPPLY. THE QUESTION

03:04:16.145 --> 03:04:18.447
IS DO WE NEED TO DESTROY

03:04:18.514 --> 03:04:20.115
BECAUSE BASICALLY BY GOING TO

03:04:20.182 --> 03:04:21.583
TEN UNITS OF MY BLOCK AND STATE

03:04:21.650 --> 03:04:23.852
BAN EYES. AND I COULD BUILD TEN

03:04:23.919 --> 03:04:25.921
UNITS ON MY BLOCK WOULD

03:04:25.988 --> 03:04:28.657
FUNDAMENTALLY IN MY JUDGMENT.

03:04:28.724 --> 03:04:29.691
AND I KNOW MY NEIGHBORS

03:04:29.758 --> 03:04:31.794
JUDGMENTS DESTROY THE CHARACTER

03:04:31.860 --> 03:04:35.798
OF MY NEIGHBORHOOD- AND SO- ALL

03:04:35.864 --> 03:04:37.032
OF A SUDDEN THOSE WOULD NO

03:04:37.099 --> 03:04:38.567
LONGER BE ASSUMING LOCAL

03:04:38.634 --> 03:04:39.401
JURISDICTIONS MADE THOSE

03:04:39.468 --> 03:04:41.270
QUESTIONS. AND SO FROM A

03:04:41.336 --> 03:04:43.272
PHILOSOPHICAL STANDPOINT YOU

03:04:43.338 --> 03:04:44.907
KNOW THE FACT THAT THE ARGUMENT

03:04:44.973 --> 03:04:47.042
WITH RESPECT TO S. B. TEN

03:04:47.109 --> 03:04:49.278
VERSES SB FIFTY IN MY VIEW. IS

03:04:49.344 --> 03:04:50.879
THE VOLUNTARY NATURE OF IT IT'S

03:04:50.946 --> 03:04:51.747
LIKE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

03:04:51.814 --> 03:04:54.183
HAVING. A BILL THAT HAS SHARP

03:04:54.249 --> 03:04:56.285
TEETH OR DENTURES IT MIGHT IT

03:04:56.351 --> 03:04:59.021
MIGHT NOT. BE EASIER TO MAKE

03:04:59.087 --> 03:05:01.123
THE ARGUMENT BUT THE REALITY

03:05:01.190 --> 03:05:01.824
FROM A PHILOSOPHICAL

03:05:01.890 --> 03:05:03.926
STANDPOINT. I CAN'T VOTE FOR

03:05:03.992 --> 03:05:05.727
THIS BILL BECAUSE WHAT I'M

03:05:05.794 --> 03:05:06.862
TELLING THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

03:05:49.304 --> 03:05:51.039
HAVE LOST BECAUSE OF. THE

03:05:51.106 --> 03:05:52.674
PANDEMIC OF THE DE CHANGE THE

03:05:52.741 --> 03:05:58.480
ECONOMY WHICH HER. FORMER-

03:05:58.547 --> 03:05:59.648
OFFICE BUILDING OR OFF PARK OR

03:05:59.715 --> 03:06:00.949
SHOPPING CENTERS TO CONVERT

03:06:01.016 --> 03:06:02.084
THOSE TOGETHER WAS CENTER

03:06:02.150 --> 03:06:03.619
PORTANTINO'S MEASURE TO FIGURE

03:06:03.685 --> 03:06:05.988
FUNDING MECHANISM. THE REALITY

03:06:06.054 --> 03:06:07.723
IS. MANY JUST DON'T SEE THAT

03:06:07.789 --> 03:06:10.192
WERE IN A POSITION IN A SOCIETY

03:06:10.259 --> 03:06:12.761
WHERE WE HAVE TO SAY. WE HAVE

03:06:12.828 --> 03:06:14.630
TO GET RID OF SINGLE FAMILY AND

03:06:14.696 --> 03:06:16.632
IT GIVE THOSE OPPORTUNITIES I

03:06:16.698 --> 03:06:18.834
FIGHT FOR THAT VALUE I THINK

03:06:18.901 --> 03:06:19.968
THAT VALUES IMPORTANT PART OF

03:06:20.035 --> 03:06:22.137
WHAT. IS IT IS PART OF THE

03:06:22.204 --> 03:06:24.973
CALIFORNIA DREAM. AND YOU KNOW

03:06:25.040 --> 03:06:26.341
IF YOU MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE READ

03:06:26.408 --> 03:06:27.476
IN THE OP ED PIECE THAT I WROTE

03:06:27.543 --> 03:06:29.211
ABOUT BUILDING HOMES. AND

03:06:29.278 --> 03:06:31.046
BUILDING HOMEOWNERSHIP. IT IS

03:06:31.113 --> 03:06:32.981
REALLY IMPORTANT FOLKS SO. EVEN

03:06:33.048 --> 03:06:34.883
THOUGH THIS IS A BILL WITH

03:06:34.950 --> 03:06:36.351
DENTURES AS OPPOSED TO SHARP

03:06:36.418 --> 03:06:38.086
TEETH IS ONE WORD I AS I TRY TO

03:06:38.153 --> 03:06:39.922
CHARACTERIZE IT BECAUSE- IT'S A

03:06:39.988 --> 03:06:42.291
VOLUNTARY. IT'S VOLUNTARY OF A

03:06:42.357 --> 03:06:43.926
PHILOSOPHY THAT I JUST DON'T

03:06:43.992 --> 03:06:46.862
SUPPORT. SO I READ THIS THING A

03:06:46.929 --> 03:06:48.830
COUPLE OF TIMES. LISTEN A LOT

03:06:48.897 --> 03:06:49.898
TO YOUR POINTS OF VIEW AND I

03:06:49.965 --> 03:06:51.733
TRIED TO BRING MYSELF TO IT. I

03:06:51.800 --> 03:06:53.635
REMEMBER SO LAST POINT TALKING

03:06:53.702 --> 03:06:55.671
TO CONGRESSMAN CARGOES IN TWO

03:06:55.737 --> 03:06:56.271
THOUSAND EIGHT WHEN WE HAD THE

03:06:56.338 --> 03:06:57.639
DOWNTURN IN THE ECONOMY. AND

03:06:57.706 --> 03:06:59.474
THEN HE INITIALLY NOTICED THAT

03:06:59.541 --> 03:07:01.176
MUCH FASTER THAN WHAT HAPPENED

03:07:01.243 --> 03:07:01.944
IN SAN FRANCISCO WITH SPEAKER

03:07:02.010 --> 03:07:04.446
PELOSI. THEN MINORITY LEADER

03:07:04.513 --> 03:07:09.217
PELOSI I THINK IT WAS- BECAUSE

03:07:09.284 --> 03:07:10.619
HE SINGLE FAMILY HOMES OR GOOD

03:07:10.686 --> 03:07:12.854
FOR. ON FIRST RUNNERS. AND I

03:07:12.921 --> 03:07:14.189
JUST I THINK WE'RE DURING A

03:07:14.256 --> 03:07:15.958
POSSIBLE CANCER SUPPORT BONUS

03:07:16.024 --> 03:07:17.593
SHIP. AND TO ALLOW PEOPLE HAVE

03:07:17.659 --> 03:07:19.628
THAT OPPORTUNITY SO. WITH THIS

03:07:19.695 --> 03:07:21.330
HAS T. THROUGH THIS VOLUNTARY

03:07:21.396 --> 03:07:23.799
NOT. IT'S INDICATIVE OF A

03:07:23.865 --> 03:07:26.401
PHILOSOPHY. THAT I CAN'T

03:07:26.468 --> 03:07:29.838
EMBRACE AND THAT BASICALLY SAYS

03:07:29.905 --> 03:07:33.408
THAT WE ARE GOING TO. AS A

03:07:33.475 --> 03:07:34.543
GOVERNMENT. CREATE AN

03:07:34.610 --> 03:07:37.913
INCENTIVIZE AND EXPEDITE AWAY

03:07:37.980 --> 03:07:39.581
TO DESTROY A SINGLE FAMILY

03:07:39.648 --> 03:07:40.215
NEIGHBORHOODS WHICH I THINK ARE

03:07:40.282 --> 03:07:42.684
CRITICAL SO. EIGHT I KNOW

03:07:42.751 --> 03:07:43.919
YOU'RE A THOUGHTFUL PERSON AND

03:07:43.986 --> 03:07:44.319
I DON'T MEAN TO BE

03:07:44.386 --> 03:07:46.188
DISRESPECTFUL IN ANY WAY. I'M

03:07:46.254 --> 03:07:48.357
JUST TELLING YOU SOMETIMES EVEN

03:07:48.423 --> 03:07:49.391

AND I JUST IT'S JUST NO WAY I

03:07:51.493 --> 03:07:53.895
CAN SUPPORT THIS. BECAUSE IT IS

03:07:53.962 --> 03:07:56.398
SO ANTITHETICAL TO WHAT I THINK

03:07:56.465 --> 03:07:58.600
IS SO IMPORTANT TO AN ELEMENT

03:07:58.667 --> 03:08:00.369

THAT'S WHY I INTRODUCED. LAST

03:09:33.695 --> 03:09:38.266
YEAR'S VERSION OF US. THE TIME

03:09:38.333 --> 03:09:38.900
SB NINE OH TWO. BECAUSE THAT'S-

03:09:38.967 --> 03:09:40.402
WHAT IT DOES. IT IS SORT OF A

03:09:40.469 --> 03:09:42.604
CARROT AND THE EMPOWERING OF

03:09:42.671 --> 03:09:44.372
CITIES THEY DON'T HAVE TO DO IT

03:09:44.439 --> 03:09:46.208
ALL. BUT WHAT WE'RE SAYING FOR

03:09:46.274 --> 03:09:47.642
THE CITIES THAT ARE INTERESTED

03:09:47.709 --> 03:09:49.878
IN DOING. A REZONING AND MIGHT

03:09:49.945 --> 03:09:51.613
JUST BE ON THEIR MAIN CORRIDOR

03:09:51.680 --> 03:09:53.115
OR MIGHT BE IN ONE PART OF THE

03:09:53.181 --> 03:09:54.716
CITY OR MIGHT THEY MIGHT JUST.

03:09:54.783 --> 03:09:56.618
NOT WANT TO DO IT ANYWHERE.

03:09:56.685 --> 03:09:57.519
WE'RE GOING TO MAKE THEIR LIVES

03:09:57.586 --> 03:09:59.621
EASIER IN DOING THAT INSTEAD OF

03:09:59.688 --> 03:10:01.923
JUST TELLING CITIES. PLEASE

03:10:01.990 --> 03:10:04.226
ZONE FOR MORE HOUSING. LET'S

03:10:04.292 --> 03:10:07.395
GIVE THEM A TOOL TO DO IT SO.

03:10:07.462 --> 03:10:09.765
HERE THIS THIS THIS LEGISLATION

03:10:09.831 --> 03:10:11.500
DOES NOT IN ANY WAY GET RID OF

03:10:11.566 --> 03:10:13.301
SINGLE FAMILY ZONING THERE ARE

03:10:13.368 --> 03:10:15.570
OTHER BILLS. THAT DO THAT THIS

03:10:15.637 --> 03:10:19.207
IS NOT ONE OF THEM. CITIES CAN

03:10:19.274 --> 03:10:21.042
DECIDE. WHEN I HAVE NO SINGLE

03:10:21.109 --> 03:10:23.245
FAMILY ZONING. THEY CAN DECIDE

03:10:23.311 --> 03:10:25.447
IF THEY WANT TO IN 90% OF THEIR

03:10:25.514 --> 03:10:27.783
CITY OR IN 50% OF THOSE CITY

03:10:27.849 --> 03:10:29.284
CITIES CAN DO WHAT THEY WANT

03:10:29.351 --> 03:10:31.286
AND THAT'S WHAT S. B. TEN- IS

03:10:31.353 --> 03:10:32.687
ABOUT I WOULDN'T CALL IT

03:10:32.754 --> 03:10:36.158
DENTURES- NO NO DISRESPECT TO

03:10:36.224 --> 03:10:38.160
PEOPLE WHO HAVE DENTURES IT IS

03:10:38.226 --> 03:10:42.664
IT IS A TRULY A CARROT- AND

03:10:42.731 --> 03:10:45.367
EMPOWER MENT OF CITIES. TO DO

03:10:45.433 --> 03:10:47.702
WHAT MANY CITIES WHAT TO DO AND

03:10:47.769 --> 03:10:50.272
TO SAY IF YOU WANT TO ALSO IN

03:10:50.338 --> 03:10:52.541
CERTAIN AREAS AND YOU'RE DOING

03:10:52.607 --> 03:10:55.043
IT IN A NON SPRAWL WAY PRICE TO

03:10:55.110 --> 03:10:57.145
DOING IT AND FILL IN YOUR JOB

03:10:57.212 --> 03:10:59.614
YOUR TRANSIT NOT SPRAWL- YOU

03:10:59.681 --> 03:11:01.550
DON'T HAVE TO DO A FIVE TO TEN

03:11:01.616 --> 03:11:03.718
YEAR PROCESS- TO DO IT SO

03:11:03.785 --> 03:11:04.653
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO

03:11:04.719 --> 03:11:07.088
HERE- AND I THINK IT'S A SOLID

03:11:07.155 --> 03:11:07.656
BILL AND I THINK IT DESERVES

03:11:07.722 --> 03:11:09.524
YOUR SUPPORT. YOU CAN ITEMS

03:11:09.591 --> 03:11:11.159
CHALLENGES RICHARD IS A LITTLE

03:11:11.226 --> 03:11:12.594
BIT HERE BACK AND FORTH YEAH

03:11:12.661 --> 03:11:15.263
SUPPORT ISSUE IT IS BUT SENATOR

03:11:15.330 --> 03:11:20.268
WINNER TO DISCUSS THIS. AND I

03:11:20.335 --> 03:11:20.836

SOMETIMES IT AND THAT'S- STAY.

03:11:22.804 --> 03:11:24.906
WILL PUT. AND THIS IS WHY. IT

03:11:24.973 --> 03:11:26.508
AS IT RELATES ISSUES I THOUGHT

03:11:26.575 --> 03:11:28.977
ABOUT IT. THAT THAT CONCERNS ME

03:11:29.044 --> 03:11:32.180
BECAUSE- YOU KNOW IT'S A TOOL

03:11:32.247 --> 03:11:34.082
THAT I WOULD USE YOU'RE RIGHT

03:11:34.149 --> 03:11:36.051
WE SHOULD GIVE TOOLS TO CREATE

03:11:36.117 --> 03:11:37.085
A HOUSING AND CENTER PORTANTINO

03:11:37.152 --> 03:11:38.587
HAS A MEASURE. WANTS TO

03:11:38.653 --> 03:11:40.121
REIMBURSE CITIES BECAUSE WE

03:11:40.188 --> 03:11:41.523
HAVE BRADLEY BURNS AND WE HAVE

03:11:41.590 --> 03:11:42.624
THIS FISCAL POSITION OF THE

03:11:42.691 --> 03:11:44.359
ID'S AND HE'S TRYING TO USE A

03:11:44.426 --> 03:11:46.061
TOOL TO BE ABLE TO INCENT

03:11:46.127 --> 03:11:48.763
SHOPPING CENTERS. AND OFFICE

03:11:48.830 --> 03:11:50.932
PARKS TO TURN INTO HOUSING AND

03:11:50.999 --> 03:11:52.400
THINGS LIKE THAT THAT'S A TOOL

03:11:52.467 --> 03:11:54.703
THAT I SUPPORT. I DON'T I MEAN

03:11:54.769 --> 03:11:56.004
IT'S LIKE WHEN WE'RE DEALING

03:11:56.071 --> 03:11:57.205
WITH POLICING WE'RE WE'RE

03:11:57.272 --> 03:11:58.506
REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE GUN

03:11:58.573 --> 03:11:59.975
IS A TOOL YOU MIGHT WANT TO USE

03:12:00.041 --> 03:12:01.810
A TASER OR DIFFERENT KIND OF A

03:12:01.877 --> 03:12:04.246
BILLY CLUB. TO ME THE ARGUMENT

03:12:04.312 --> 03:12:06.281
YOU MAKE IS COMPLETELY FAIR WE

03:12:06.348 --> 03:12:07.883
NEED TOOLS THAT WE HAVE

03:12:07.949 --> 03:12:09.684
CHALLENGES. ONLY MAKE TWO

03:12:09.751 --> 03:12:11.620
OBSERVATIONS IN THAT REGARD HEY

03:12:11.686 --> 03:12:12.787
THIS IS NOT A TOOL I WOULD USE

03:12:12.854 --> 03:12:15.490
BECAUSE THE POWER OF THE STATE

03:12:15.557 --> 03:12:17.692
IS EXTRAORDINARY. AND EVEN

03:12:17.759 --> 03:12:19.561
THOUGH IT'S A TOOL IT MAKES A

03:12:19.628 --> 03:12:21.796
STATEMENT THROUGH THE BACK DOOR

03:12:21.863 --> 03:12:24.165
ABOUT IT'S OKAY TO BUILD TEN

03:12:24.232 --> 03:12:25.767
UNITS ON A TEN THOUSAND SQUARE

03:12:25.834 --> 03:12:27.569
FOOT LOT. IN THE MIDDLE OF

03:12:27.636 --> 03:12:29.237
SOMEBODY'S NEIGHBORHOOD AND

03:12:29.304 --> 03:12:30.238
THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN WHEN YOU

03:12:30.305 --> 03:12:32.140
LOOK AT THE POLITICS AND THE

03:12:32.207 --> 03:12:33.975
INCENTIVES FOR PEOPLE WHO WANT

03:12:34.042 --> 03:12:36.111
TO DEVELOP THOSE NEIGHBORHOODS

03:12:36.177 --> 03:12:36.778
AND WILL PAY FOR POLITICAL

03:12:36.845 --> 03:12:38.747
CAMPAIGNS. AND BE ABLE TO MAKE

03:12:38.813 --> 03:12:40.415
ARGUMENTS FIRST AS THE PEOPLE

03:12:40.482 --> 03:12:41.416
IN THE NEIGHBORHOODS THE

03:12:41.483 --> 03:12:44.252
DISPARITY OF POWER IS SO GREAT

03:12:44.319 --> 03:12:45.553
SO THAT ALL OF A SUDDEN

03:12:45.620 --> 03:12:46.788
SOMEBODY'S GOT TWENTY FIVE

03:12:46.855 --> 03:12:48.623
MILLION DOLLARS DEVELOPER IN MY

03:12:48.690 --> 03:12:50.392
CITY PUTS A MEASURE ON THE

03:12:50.458 --> 03:12:51.960
BALLOT BECAUSE IT'S NOT ALLOWED

03:12:52.027 --> 03:12:53.094
BECAUSE WE AS A STATE HAVE SENT

03:12:53.161 --> 03:12:54.863
THAT. WE THEY WILL USE THE

03:12:54.930 --> 03:12:55.931
ARGUMENT THAT THE STATE OF

03:12:55.997 --> 03:12:57.599
CALIFORNIA SAYS THIS IS A GOOD

03:12:57.666 --> 03:12:59.734
AN APPROPRIATE TOOL SO THERE

03:12:59.801 --> 03:13:01.336
ARE A TOTAL NUMBER OF TOOLS WE

03:13:01.403 --> 03:13:03.905
CAN USE TO DEAL WITH THE ISSUE

03:13:03.972 --> 03:13:05.941
OF BOTH CREATING SUPPLY WHICH

03:13:06.007 --> 03:13:07.309
IS WHAT I'M WORKING ON WITH MY

03:13:07.375 --> 03:13:11.880
SELF LIQUIDATING. BOND ISSUE

03:13:11.947 --> 03:13:12.514
THAT I'M WORKING ON FOR AWHILE.

03:13:12.580 --> 03:13:13.181
AND CREE A HALF OF MY NEW YEAR.

03:13:13.248 --> 03:13:15.250
AS TO. IT IMPAC THE CORE OF

03:13:15.317 --> 03:13:16.251
WHAT NEIGHBORHOODS MIGHT LOOK

03:13:16.318 --> 03:13:17.752
LIKE. THERE COULD BE OTHER

03:13:17.819 --> 03:13:19.654
TOOLS IT COULD WORK. I JUST I

03:13:19.721 --> 03:13:20.789
DON'T LIKE THIS TOOL BECAUSE I

03:13:20.855 --> 03:13:21.356
THINK IT HAS ADVERSE

03:13:21.423 --> 03:13:23.425
CONSEQUENCES. AND I THINK IT'S

03:13:23.491 --> 03:13:25.427
AS THE POWER OF THE STATE. I

03:13:25.493 --> 03:13:26.962
THINK IT'S IT SENDS A MESSAGE

03:13:27.028 --> 03:13:28.263
THAT'S NOT CONSISTENT WITH MY

03:13:28.330 --> 03:13:30.131
CORE VALUES SO. JUST IF I COULD

03:13:30.198 --> 03:13:31.266
ADD THAT TO AND HAPPY TO LISTEN

03:13:31.333 --> 03:13:32.600
BUDDY I WANTED TO ENGAGE A

03:13:32.667 --> 03:13:33.368
LITTLE BIT BECAUSE THE

03:13:36.371 --> 03:13:38.039
TO BE CLEAR. WE TALK ABOUT THE

03:13:38.106 --> 03:13:40.175
POWER OF THE STATE. THIS IS THE

03:13:40.241 --> 03:13:42.677
STATE GETTING OUT OF THE WAY OF

03:13:42.744 --> 03:13:44.846

04:51:27.102 --> 04:51:28.437
THREE HUNDRED CONNECTIONS CAP.

04:51:28.504 --> 04:51:30.573
AND SUGGESTED NONSENSE THAT'S A

04:51:30.639 --> 04:51:32.675
POSITIVE CHANGE HAVING THE

04:51:32.741 --> 04:51:34.844
CLEAR DEFINITIONS OF SUGGEST TO

04:51:34.910 --> 04:51:36.345
NONSENSE THAT'S ANOTHER

04:51:36.412 --> 04:51:39.148
POSITIVE CHANGE. THERE'S A

04:51:39.215 --> 04:51:41.317
SUGGESTION FOR DESIGNATION

04:51:41.383 --> 04:51:43.652
DISPUTE MECHANISM AND WE WANT

04:51:43.719 --> 04:51:45.321
TO REVIEW THAT LANGUAGE BUT WE

04:51:45.387 --> 04:51:46.455
AGREE WITH THE OSCAR IN THE

04:51:46.522 --> 04:51:48.224
SPONSORS THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE

04:51:48.290 --> 04:51:53.696
A GOOD PROCESS- YOU KNOW IN

04:51:53.762 --> 04:51:56.298
THAT CATEGORY. ARMY TO. AT THIS.

04:51:56.365 --> 04:51:58.701
IT THE OTHER PER OF THE BILL.

04:51:58.767 --> 04:52:00.569
AND THAT'S THE- FOR CAN.

04:52:00.636 --> 04:52:02.838
AUTHORITY OR THE AT RISK

04:52:02.905 --> 04:52:06.408
DOMESTIC WELLS. WE APPRECIATE

04:52:06.475 --> 04:52:09.144
THAT THE ANALYSIS SUGGESTED

04:52:09.211 --> 04:52:10.479
THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE

04:52:10.546 --> 04:52:12.848
INSPECTION OR TESTING OF THE

04:52:12.915 --> 04:52:15.351
DOMESTIC WELLS ON TO DETERMINE

04:52:15.417 --> 04:52:17.753
IF THEY'RE AT RISK. THIS RAISES

04:52:17.820 --> 04:52:19.421
THE QUESTION OF COURSE WHAT

04:52:19.488 --> 04:52:20.956
WITH THE INSPECTION OR

04:52:21.023 --> 04:52:22.458
MONITORING NEED TO SHOW FOR THE

04:52:22.524 --> 04:52:25.961
WORLD TO BE AT RISK AND I'M SO

04:52:26.028 --> 04:52:26.829
FOR THE BILL WOULD BE SILENT ON

04:52:26.896 --> 04:52:29.498
THAT. ARE YOU THINKING I'M JUST

04:52:29.565 --> 04:52:32.101
STEPPING BACK IS THAT THIS PART

04:52:32.167 --> 04:52:34.637

THE OUT REDUCE DOMESTIC WELLS

04:52:39.541 --> 04:52:43.012
WE THINK THAT'S PREMATURE.

04:52:43.078 --> 04:52:43.946
WATER BOARD DOES NOT GENERALLY

04:52:44.013 --> 04:52:46.382
REGULATE PRIVATE DOMESTIC WELLS

04:52:46.448 --> 04:52:48.550
THAT'S DONE AT THE COUNTY LEVEL.

04:52:48.617 --> 04:52:49.952
THE WORKED AT THE STATE WATER

04:52:50.019 --> 04:52:52.354
BOARD ON AT RISK WELLS IS NEW

04:52:52.421 --> 04:52:54.456
THERE'S A LOT OF THAT GOING ON

04:52:54.523 --> 04:52:55.457
TO THE CREDIT OF THE STATE

04:52:55.524 --> 04:52:57.526
BOARD STAFF THIRTY SECOND WAS

DATA IN THIS AREA THEN THERE IS

04:53:02.064 --> 04:53:04.033
FOR THE PUBLIC WATER SYSTEMS IN

04:53:04.099 --> 04:53:05.668
THE STATE WATER BOARDS JUST

VERY COMPLICATED ISSUE.

PATTERSON ISSUE THAT'S BEEN

04:54:48.003 --> 04:54:50.272

ABOUT THESE ISSUES.

04:55:02.117 --> 04:55:03.819
PARTICULARLY IN TWO THOUSAND

04:55:03.886 --> 04:55:05.554
AND NINE ONE WE DEVISED A NEW

04:55:05.621 --> 04:55:07.589
WATER PLANNED FOR THE STATE OF

04:55:07.656 --> 04:55:10.125
CALIFORNIA. I'M DELIGHTED THAT

04:55:10.192 --> 04:55:11.427
THEY ARE ACKNOWLEDGING THAT

04:55:11.493 --> 04:55:13.429
HUMANS HAVE A WATER RIGHT. BUT

04:55:13.495 --> 04:55:15.531
IN TWO THOUSAND AND NINE FOR

04:55:15.597 --> 04:55:18.033
DECADES. HUMAN WATER RIGHT USED

04:55:18.100 --> 04:55:19.902
TO BE THE PRE EMINENT RIGHT AND

04:55:19.968 --> 04:55:21.537
OVER DECADES THAT WAS

04:55:21.603 --> 04:55:23.806
DIMINISHED. TO A SMALL LOCAL

04:55:23.872 --> 04:55:26.442
THIRD OF THE HIGHEST PRIORITY

04:55:26.508 --> 04:55:28.744
FOR WATER HUMAN. PAGE WERE

04:55:28.811 --> 04:55:31.780
FIRST. NOBODY PAID ANY

04:55:31.847 --> 04:55:33.682
ATTENTION TO THAT WE FINALLY

04:55:33.749 --> 04:55:35.451
DID ACCOMPLISH IN TWO THOUSAND

04:55:35.517 --> 04:55:37.853
AND NINE SOMETHING TOWARDS THAT

04:55:37.920 --> 04:55:41.223
END. NOR WERE THEY HAVE VERY

04:55:41.290 --> 04:55:43.192
VERBOSE ABOUT ANY NEED TO

04:55:43.258 --> 04:55:46.395
INCREASE OUR WATER SUPPLIES IN

04:55:46.462 --> 04:55:49.998
CALIFORNIA. FINALLY IF

04:55:50.065 --> 04:55:51.567
PROPOSITION ONE WERE ABLE TO

04:55:51.633 --> 04:55:54.703
GET SOME FUNDS IN THERE TOO.

04:55:54.770 --> 04:55:57.072
AND CREATION SURPLUS STORAGE AT

04:55:57.139 --> 04:55:59.908
LEAST ONE LARGE SURPLUS STORAGE

04:55:59.975 --> 04:56:03.378
FACILITY. MOST OF THAT WILL BE

04:56:03.445 --> 04:56:07.816
PROBABLY ENVIRONMENTAL WATER.

04:56:07.883 --> 04:56:11.019
BUT IT DOES EASE THE PRESSURE.

04:56:11.086 --> 04:56:13.522
ENTRIES UP OTHER WATER SOURCES.

04:56:13.589 --> 04:56:15.224
IN ADDITIONTHEY WERE ABSENT

04:56:15.290 --> 04:56:16.325
WHEN WE WERE DEALING WITH THE

04:56:16.391 --> 04:56:17.326
SUSTAINABLE GROUNDWATER

04:56:17.392 --> 04:56:20.028
MANAGEMENT DISTRICT BEING

04:56:20.095 --> 04:56:22.297
CREATED THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA.

04:56:22.364 --> 04:56:24.967
THEY ARE. UNDER THE AUTHORITY

04:56:25.033 --> 04:56:26.735
OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS BUT THE

04:56:26.802 --> 04:56:28.537
STATE HAS A PROVISION IN THERE

04:56:28.604 --> 04:56:30.172
WHERE IF THE STATE DOESN'T LIKE

04:56:30.239 --> 04:56:32.007
WHAT THE COUNTY DOES THEY CAN

04:56:32.074 --> 04:56:34.877
USURP. THAT LOCAL AUTHORITIES

04:56:34.943 --> 04:56:37.980
THIS WILL AFFECT. AT THE TIME

04:56:38.046 --> 04:56:40.649
IT WAS REPORTED THAT DOMESTIC

04:56:40.716 --> 04:56:43.418
WELLS WILL NOT BE BOTHERED. I

04:56:43.485 --> 04:56:45.721
DON'T BELIEVE THAT YOU BETTER

04:56:45.787 --> 04:56:48.290
BELIEVE DOMESTIC WELLS ARE

04:56:48.357 --> 04:56:48.891
GONNA COME UNDER SOME KIND OF

04:56:48.957 --> 04:56:51.393
AUTHORITY. AND I DON'T

04:56:51.460 --> 04:56:52.895
NECESSARILY TRUST THE WATER

04:56:52.961 --> 04:56:55.130
RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD TO BE

04:56:55.197 --> 04:56:58.901
REGULATING DOMESTIC WELLS. THE

04:56:58.967 --> 04:57:00.335
TRACK RECORD IN MANY AREAS IS

04:57:00.402 --> 04:57:06.074
NOT GOOD. IT'S A GOOD IDEA. BUT

04:57:06.141 --> 04:57:08.043
I THINK IT NEEDS TO BE FLOATED.

04:57:08.110 --> 04:57:10.312
A LOT FURTHER AND I THEREFORE

04:57:10.379 --> 04:57:11.947
CANNOT SUPPORT IT TODAY AGAIN

04:57:12.014 --> 04:57:15.784
WATER IS VERY VERY COMPLICATED.

04:57:15.851 --> 04:57:17.419
AND INDIVIDUALS WHO TRY TO

04:57:17.486 --> 04:57:19.454
ENGAGE IN THIS SHOULD REALLY

COME TO UNDERSTAND A LOT MORE

04:57:20.622 --> 04:57:23.859
ABOUT IT I DON'T THINK SOME OF

04:57:23.926 --> 04:57:25.961
THOSE WHO ARE ENGAGED HERE. I

04:57:26.028 --> 04:57:28.664
DO UNDERSTAND THEY UNDERSTAND A

04:57:28.730 --> 04:57:31.133
