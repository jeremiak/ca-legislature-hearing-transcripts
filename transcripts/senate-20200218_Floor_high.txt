OUR LIVES AS BLACK PEOPLE AS WELL AS FREDERICK DOUGLASS AS OF FEBRUARY WAS SELECTED VERY INTENTIONALLY TO CREATE AN OPPORTUNITY TO PAUSE AND TALK ABOUT THE RELEVANCE. THAT NEGROES BLACKS AFTER AMERICANS HAVE HAD IN THIS COUNTRY OVER TIME. CASE IN POINT A HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE YEARS AGO. THE THIRTEENTH AMENDMENT WHICH ABOLISHED SLAVERY WAS RATIFIED BY THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEARS AGO THE FIFTEENTH AMENDMENT WHICH GAVE BLACK MEN THE RIGHT TO VOTE WAS RATIFIED. ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGO THE NINETEENTH AMENDMENT WHICH FINALLY GAVE BLACK WOMEN THE RIGHT TO VOTE WAS RATIFIED. SIXTY SIX YEARS AGO THE US SUPREME COURT RULED THAT RACIAL SEGREGATION AT PUBLIC SCHOOLS WAS UNCONSTITUTIONAL. FIFTY SIX YEARS AGO THE CIVIL RIGHTS ACT WAS PASSED WHICH OUTLAWED DISCRIMINATION BASED ON RACE. THAT'S WHERE THE GREEN BOOK THAT I'M URE MY COLLEAGUE WILL EXPLAIN TO THE LATER.

THANK YOU SENATOR MITCHELL SEEING NO FURTHER DEBATE OR DISCUSSION SENATOR BRADFORD TO YOU MAY CLOSE THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUES TO. LENT THEIR VOICES TO THIS IMPORTANT RESOLUTION AND AS I STATED IN THE BEGINNING BLACK HISTORY IS AMERICAN HISTORY. AND IT'S SOMEWHAT SAD THAT WE HAVE TO STAND UP ONCE A YEAR AND RECOGNIZE THE CONTRIBUTIONS THAT AFRICAN AMERICANS OF MAY TO THIS COUNTRY FOR OVER FOUR HUNDRED YEARS. AND LAST YEAR WE HAD A CONTENTIOUS DEBATE ALLEN BOTH HOUSES ABOUT A PIECE OF LEGISLATION OUR COLLEAGUE FROM SACRAMENTO- AUTHORED AS IT RELATES TO VACCINATIONS. BUT IF WE ARE WHERE THE FIRST VACCINATION OR NOT ELECTION FROM DISEASE WAS BY AFRICA HERE IN BOSTON. AND SEVENTEEN TWENTY ONE. AND MANY PEOPLE WERE OUTRAGED BUT IT'S SAVED HUNDREDS OF NOT THOUSANDS OF LIVES IN BOSTON IN SEVENTEEN TWENTY ONE. THE OF IS KNOWN PLENTY PEOPLE WHO'VE NEEDED A BLOOD TRANSFUSION. WE HAVE TO THANK- CHARLES R. DREW A BLACK POSITION WHO LOST HIS LIFE BECAUSE HE DIED IN A HOSPITAL HE BLED TO DEATH BECAUSE THEY WOULD NOT SERVE HIM. BECAUSE IT WAS A WHITE HOSPITAL. AND FOR ALL OF US WHO ARE FANS OF WESTERNS AND THE LONG RANGER AND HIS GOOD FRIEND TANTO WELL IF YOU REALLY KNOW HISTORY THAT LONE RANGER WAS A BLACK COWBOY WHO BECAME A US MARSHAL AND IS TRAVELING COMPANION WAS A NATIVE AMERICAN AND HE WROTE A WHITE HORSE. BUT WE NEVER GOT CREDIT FOR THAT. AS I WAS STATING ABOUT THE KANJI AND ELI WHITNEY IS THE ONE WHO'S CREDIT AWAITED BUT BELIEVE ME IT WAS A SLAVE. THAT DESIGNED THE TECHNIQUE COULD CALM THE SEATS AND THAT BORN OUT OF THE- ART OF THE COD BECAUSE AGAIN. NO SLAVE MASTER OR I SHOULD SAY WHITE GUY WOULD BE CONCERNED ABOUT MAKING LABOR ANY EASIER IT WAS THE SLAVE WHO WAS DOING THIS LABOR WAS TRYING TO BE AN AN INNOVATIVE IN MAKING THEIR- PASS A LITTLE BIT EASIER THAT'S WHY THEY INVENTED. THE ELEVATOR BECAUSE THEY WERE LIFTING THINGS UP IN DOWN IN BUILDINGS AND THE INNOVATIONS OF AFTER AMERICANS GO ON AND ON FOR US WHO CALL OURSELVES ENVIRONMENTALISTS. MANY SAY THE FIRST ENVIRONMENTALISTS IN THIS COUNTRY WAS GEORGE WASHINGTON CARVER WHO. WANTED TO SIR- RESTORES SOIL PRESERVATION ANY INCURRED SOUTHERN FARMERS TO STOP PLANNING CORPS COTTON. AND PLANT PEANUTS. AND SWEET POTATO THAT'S THIS RESTORED THE NUTRIENTS BACK INTO THE SOIL. AND THIS WAS IN THE EARLY NINETEEN HUNDREDS WE CAN GO ON AND ON AND ON. EVEN THOSE WHO ARE FANS OF BETTY BOOP. THE FAMOUS CARTOON FROM THE NINETEEN THIRTIES. WELL IT WAS A SINGER BY THE NAME OF ESTHER JONES THAT WAS KNOWN AS BABY ASTOR WHO WAS THE ORIGINAL. FIGURE FOR CREATING THAT IMAGE BUT IT WAS A- WHITE SINGER A FEW YEARS LATER WHO THOUGHT. MS JONES PERFORMING AND SHE COPIED HER STYLE WITH THE BOOK- PRODUCED IN OUR SEEING AND THEY'RE INCLINED WENT AND THEN THEY AND I CAME OUT WITH THE CARTOON HELLING KLEIN KANE I SHOULD SAY SHE FILE LAWSUITS THE AN INFRINGEMENT ON HER IMAGE. AND THE COURTS ROUTE THIS IS NO YOU'RE NOT THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS IMAGE EVEN THOUGH ESTHER JONES NEVER GOT CREDIT FOR CREATING THE IMAGE IN ANY EVER LIKENESS BATES THE NIGHT MRS KAYNE SUIT FOR TRYING TO CLAIM THAT SHE WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR. IN MANY WAYS MY FRIENDS AND COLLEAGUES WE SAY WE DID IT. BUT AMERICANS HIT IT THEY'VE HIDDEN MANY OF OUR ACCOMPLISHMENTS IN THIS COUNTRY THEY'VE HIDDEN IT BY NOT PUT IT IN BOOKS FORCED TO LEARN THEY'VE HIDDEN IT BY THE NINE ETHNIC STUDIES AND OUR SCHOOLS SOMETHING THAT WE WILL BE DISSIPATING HERE IN THIS CHAMBER SOON. THEY'VE DONE IT BY- PERSON THEY DONE IT BY ALL THE HORRIBLE THINGS THAT WE'RE ALL AWARE OF BUT WE STAND HERE TODAY KNOWING THAT THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF MADE THIS COUNTRY GREAT. THE CONTRIBUTIONS. THAT HAVE MADE THIS COUNTRY GREAT ARE STILL BEING MADE BY NOT ONLY AFTER AMERICANS BUT BUT ALL PEOPLE. AND WE DO I THINK OF MY COLLEAGUE THE CHAIR OF THE JEWISH CAUCUS BECAUSE- IN THE LATE THIRTIES WHEN. H. B. C. USE WERE AT THEIR HIGH GROWTH IT WAS THE JEWISH PROFESSORS THAT WORK KICKED OUT OF GERMANY AND AUSTRIA WHO CAME TO THE H. B. C. USE AND THEY TAUGHT CLASSES AND THEY BECAME- RESIDENT PROFESSORS AT THESE H. B. C. USE SO THERE'S BEEN A LONG. PARTNERSHIP WITH THE JEWISH COMMUNITY. BUT AGAIN MEMBERS. WE HAVE TO THINK CARTER G. WHAT'S IN FOR HIS VISION AND AS MY COLLEAGUE FROM LA STATED ALL OF YOU HAVE BEEN GIVING THE GREEN BOOK. THIS WAS THE BIBLE FOR AFRICAN AMERICANS SOME SEVENTY YEARS AGO IF THEY WANT TO TRAVERSE THIS COUNTRY AND DO IT SAFELY. THIS WAS THE BIBLE WHERE THEY COULD STAY WHERE THEY COULD KEY. WHERE THEY COULD FILL THEIR CAR. WHETHER THE KIDS SEEK REFUGE YOU NAME IT THIS WAS IT SO I HOPE YOU TAKE IT I HOPE YOU LOOK AT IT IN AS ONE OF MY COLLEGE WAS REALLY LOOKING AT SOME OF THE PLACES THAT EXISTED IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY WAS ONLY TO. THAT EXISTED IN CENTRAL VALLEY IN THIS PUBLICATION BUT I STAND HERE TO SAY HONOR. TO RECOGNIZE THE CONTRIBUTIONS AND UNDERSTANDING THAT THERE ARE STILL MORE TO BE MADE BUT AGAIN AFRICAN AMERICAN HISTORY IS AMERICAN HISTORY AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE.
