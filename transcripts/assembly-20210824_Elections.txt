FIRST ASSEMBLYMEMBER LUIS RIVAS HAS BEEN APPOINTED TO THE COMMITTEE TO REPLACE ASSEMBLY MEMBER STEVE BENNETT. FOR THE ONLY. ASSEMBLY MEMBER RIVAS THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US SECOND THE COMMITTEE HAS BEEN REQUESTED BY THE SPEAKER'S OFFICE TO PASS SB FIVE NINETY FOUR AND DIRECTLY TO THE ASSEMBLY FLOOR. SO THE MOTION ON THE BILL TODAY WILL BE TO PASS THE BILL TO THE FLOOR. WITH ALMOST ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE WAY WILL NOW MOVE ON TO THE COMMITTEE'S AGENDA THE FIRST ITEM ON THE AGENDA IS. AB FOR SB FIVE NINETY FOUR BY CENTER GLAZER THANK YOU CENTER GLAZER FOR JOINING US TODAY YOU MAY PRESENT YOUR BILL. THANK YOU AT THAT WORK IN YEAH YEP THAT WAS OKAY YEAH I THANK THE CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE ME FIRST JUST THAT EXPRESS MY APPRECIATION TO- THE STAFF OF YOUR COMMITTEE WELL AS MY STAFF THAT WORKED ON THIS ISSUE OVER THE LAST OF MANY MANY WEEKS AND MONTHS AND I APPRECIATE IT VERY MUCH- AS MANY OF YOU KNOW DUE TO THE COBIT NINETEEN PANDEMIC. THE RELEASE OF CENSUS DATA WAS SIGNIFICANTLY DELAYED THE CYCLE WHICH LED THE SUPREME COURT TO MOVE BACK THE DEADLINE FOR STATE AND CONGRESSIONAL REDISTRICTING BY SEVERAL MONTHS THE ORIGINAL DEADLINE. WAS AUGUST FIFTEENTH OF THIS YEAR THE NEW DEADLINE IS NOT FULLY SETTLED. AND WILL LIKELY BE CLARIFIED BY THE THROUGH THE SUPREME COURT. BUT MOST LIKELY BE SOMETIME BETWEEN LATE DECEMBER OF THIS YEAR AND EARLIER NAY JANUARY OF NEXT YEAR AS A RESULT OF THIS EXTENSION THE ELECTION CALENDAR LEADING UP TO THE TWENTY TWENTY TWO PRIMARY. NEEDS TO BE ADJUSTED TO RECONCILE THE REDISTRICTING TIMELINE WITH THE CANDIDATE FILING TIMELINE. AND TO PROVIDE ELECTION OFFICIALS WITH TIME TO RE PRECINCT THERE AREA SB FIVE NINETY FOUR ACCOMPLISHES THIS BY AMONG OTHER ADJUSTMENTS SHORTENING THE PERIOD FOR COLLECTING SIGNATURES- IN LIEU OF PAYING A FILING FEE. AND POTENTIALLY ALSO SHORTENING THE TIME PERIOD FOR FILING NOMINATION DOCUMENTS DEPENDING ON HOW LATE THE SUPREME COURT SETS THE STATE REDISTRICTING DEADLINE TO ACCOUNT FOR THIS ABBREVIATED TIMELINE. THIS BILL REDUCES THE NUMBER OF NECESSARY SIGNATURES IN LIEU IN PROPORTION TO THE REDUCTION IN TIME AND ALSO GETS CANDIDATES FOR BOARD OF EQUALIZATION THE STATE LEGISLATURE THE FLEXIBILITY TO ESTABLISH THE DISTRICT RESIDENCY. AT THE TIME THEY FILE RATHER THEN WHEN THEY PULL THEIR NOMINATION PAPERS SB FIVE NINETY FOUR ALSO MAKES A NUMBER OF IMPORTANT CHANGES TO THE LOCAL REDISTRICTING PROCESS INCLUDING. CORRECTING POTENTIAL AMBIGUITIES IN STATE LAW THAT MIGHT OTHERWISE REQUIRE LOCAL MAPS TO BE APPROVED MORE THAN A MONTH EARLIER THAN WAS INTENDED AND CREATING A MORE UNIFORM DEADLINE FOR SPECIAL DISTRICT REDISTRICTING. THAT ALSO ELIMINATES UNNECESSARILY EARLY DEADLINE FOR CERTAIN SPECIAL DISTRICTS THAT THESE CHANGES PROVIDE LOCAL GOVERNMENT WITH MORE FLEXIBILITY AND TIME TO DELIBERATE. WHILE PRESERVING TIME FOR ELECTION OFFICIALS TO IMPLEMENT THE NEW LINES FOR THESE REASONS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE TODAY ON SB FIVE NINETY FOUR I HAVE WITH ME SANTA CRUZ COUNTY REGISTRAR TRICIA WEBER. WHO IS WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF CLERKS AND ELECTION OFFICIALS. I KNOW THEY DON'T HAVE A FORMAL POSITION ON THIS BILL THAT MS WEBER WILL SPEAK TO SOME PROVISIONS OF THE BILL THAT THE ASSOCIATION CONSIDERS IMPORTANT FOR ELECTION ADMINISTRATION THANK YOU CENTER GLAZER AND MS WEBER- IF YOU'RE AVAILABLE BY PHONE WE'RE READY WHENEVER YOU ARE. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THE MORNING CARE BERMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AND SENATOR GLAZER. I'M TRICIA WEBER THE SANTA CRUZ COUNTY CLERK REGISTRAR OF VOTERS AND I'M ALSO THE CO CHAIR OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF CLERKS AND ELECTION OFFICIALS LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEE I THANK THE SENATOR GLAZER MENTIONED- COMMITTEE IS NEITHER IN SUPPORT OR OPPOSITION TO S. B. FIVE NINETY FOUR BUT WE ARE ASKED TO SPEAK TO THE NECESSARY ASPECTS OF THE BILL AND TO ANSWER ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS EMAIL HAVE AS YOU KNOW THE PANDEMIC CARSON SYSTEM DATA DELAYS AND THOSE DELAYS HAVE A DIRECT IMPACT ON THE UPCOMING REDISTRICTING PROCESS. ELECTIONS OFFICIALS RECOGNIZE THAT CHANGES IN STATE LAW ARE REQUIRED TO CONDUCT A SUCCESSFUL PRIMARY ELECTION NEXT YEAR. AND SB FIVE NINETY FOUR HELPS THE SITUATION FIRST OFF SB FIVE NINETY FOUR ALIGN STATES FOR CERTAIN SPECIAL DISTRICTS TO SUBMIT THEIR LINES TO ELECTION OFFICIALS WHICH WILL HELP ELECTION OFFICIALS CREATE. A SYSTEM TO GET THEM STARTED SO WHEN WE HAVE ALL OF THE LINES WERE ABLE TO DO THE REPRIEVE SINKING AND GET AND SUBMIT THOSE NEW DISTRICT- NEW PRECINCTS SB FIVE NINETY FOUR ALSO ADDRESSES THE START DATE FOR THE SIGNATURE IN LIEU COLLECTION PERIOD WHICH IS THE FIRST ACTIVITY CANDIDATES MAY UNDERTAKE AND THEIR RUN FOR A PRIMARY ELECTION OFFICE WITHOUT A CHANGE IN STATE LAW THE SIGNATURE IN THE PERIOD IS SET TO START ON DECEMBER SIXTEENTH. HOWEVER THE SOONEST NEW CONGRESSIONAL AND STATE LEGISLATIVE DISTRICT LINES WILL BE FINALIZED IS DECEMBER TWENTY SEVENTH. I THINK ELECTION OFFICIALS TO ISSUE SIGNATURE ON THE DOCUMENT TO PEOPLE WHOSE DISTRICT ARE UNVEILED OR SOME CANDIDATES WILL HAVE MORE TIME TO COLLECT SIGNATURES THAN OTHERS WHICH IS DISPARAGEMENT THESE WINDS COULD POSSIBLY FINALIZED AS LATE AS JANUARY FOURTEENTH IF. THE BILL CAN FEED THE CONVENTION REQUESTED BY THE CITIZENS REDISTRICTING COMMISSION IS GRANTED BY THE SUPREME COURT SB FIVE NINETY FOUR ADDRESSES THIS PROBLEM BY SETTING THE DATE FOR SIGNATURE IN THE COLLECTION TO BEGIN SEVEN DAYS AFTER WHATEVER THE STATE REDISTRICTING DEADLINE ENDS UP BEING. BEST AVOIDING A FIX DATE TIED TO THE JANUARY FOURTEENTH WHICH COULD ARTIFICIALLY TRUNCATE THIS IMPORTANT PROCESS IF THE COURT RULES FOR AN EARLIER DATE IN A SIMILAR MANNER THIS BILL CHANGES THE END DATE OF THE SIGNATURE IN LIEU PERIOD AND THE BEGINNING OF THE CANDIDATE NOMINATION PERIOD FROM SIX STATES SET BY CURRENT LAW. THE FORTY ONE DAYS AFTER THE STATE REDISTRICTING DEADLINE AND FORTY SIX DAYS AFTER. THAT AND FORTY SIX. DAYS RESPECTIVELY KEEPING A TO FIND SEPARATE PERIOD FOR THE TWO DIFFERENT TASKS AND THAT'S DEFINITELY PREFERRED BY THE ELECTION OFFICIALS ADDITIONALLY FIVE NINETY FOUR ESTABLISHES A FORMULA TO BE USED TO RECALCULATE THE VALUE OF EACH SIGNATURE IN LIEU BECAUSE OF THE SHORTENED COLLECTION PERIOD. AND IT PLACES THE RESPONSIBILITY OF CALCULATING THOSE VALUES WITH THE SECRETARY OF STATE'S OFFICE. BY PLACING THIS RESPONSIBILITY WITH THE SECRETARY OF STATE THERE WILL BEA UNIFORM APPLICATION OF THIS FORMULA ACROSS ALL FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES. AND IF THE WOMEN IT'S THE CONCERNS THAT CANDIDATES MIGHT HAVE IF YOU ARE MORE COUNTIES DISAGREED ON HOW TO CALCULATE THE VALUE OF THE SIGNATURE FINALLY THIS BILL DOES NOT MOVE THE LAST STATE TO COMPLETE CANDIDATE FILING WHICH IS SET BY ALLIED EIGHTY EIGHT DAYS BEFORE THE ELECTION. OR EIGHTY THREE DAYS BEFORE IF AN INCUMBENT FAILS TO FILE FOR OFFICE. THIS IS A CRITICAL FEATURE OF THE BILL AS AN EXTENSION OF THE DEADLINE HAS A MAJOR DOWNSTREAM OF FACT WITH OTHER ELECTION DUTIES THAT CANNOT BE SUFFICIENTLY MAPPED OUT IF WE'RE ATTEMPTING TO CONDUCT. OTHER ELECTIONS FOR STILL DOING THE REDISTRICTING WE REGISTERED ARE STILL CONCERNED THAT WE WILL NOT HAVE ENOUGH TIME TO ADEQUATELY INPUT IMPROVE THE REDISTRICTING DATA THAT WE MAKE IT AS LATE AS JANUARY FOURTEENTH. HOWEVER SB NINETY FOUR PROVIDES THE FLEXIBILITY WITH THE EARLIEST DEADLINES AND MAINTAINS THE MOST CRUCIAL DEADLINES FOR CANDIDATES FOR YOU FINALLY. THANK YOU AND I'M AVAILABLE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MAY HAVE THANK YOU MS WEBER- AND WILL NOT MOVE ON A MISTER MY A TO- THE PERMANENCE IN OPPOSITION I GIVE MISS WEBER FOUR MINUTES INSTEAD OF TWO BECAUSE THERE IS ONLY ONE. FROM MY WITNESS AND SUPPORT THERE'S ONLY ONE PERSON ONE IS IN OPPOSITION TO MR MADE IT. FEEL FREE TO TAKE THE PERFORMANCE IF YOU'D LIKE AND WE'RE READY WHEN YOU ARE THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO BE HEARD ON THIS IMPORTANT LEGISLATION AFFECTING VOTING RIGHTS MY NAME IS DANIEL MY AT A CO CHAIR OF THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY CITIZENS REDISTRICTING COMMISSION. IT'S THE FIRST BODY IN HISTORY TASKED WITH DRAWING NEW SUPERMAJORITY WILL DISTRICTS IN L. A. COUNTY COMPLETELY INDEPENDENT OF THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS. YOU DO THIS TASK WE MUST WE HAVE TO EVALUATE TWENTY TWENTY CENSUS DATA TAKE PUBLIC INPUT TO ALL FIVE DISTRICTS WITH THE SAME POPULATION THAT EITHER FAVOR VOTER SCREAMING EIGHT AGAINST POLITICAL PARTIES OR INCUMBENTS. THAT WE COMPLY WITH THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT AND THAT SURVIVOR SERIES OF WHAT THE SUSPECTED TO BE ROCKED THIS PUBLIC HEARINGS. AND TO DO ALL OF THIS NO LATER THAN OUR STATUTORY MAP ADOPTION DEADLINE OF DECEMBER FIFTEENTH TWENTY TWENTY ONE. IT WAS ALWAYS A CHALLENGE BUT THE DELAY OF THE CENSUS DATA MAKES THIS TASK EXTREMELY DIFFICULT THE CALIFORNIA CRC IS ASKING THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT BURNING SCANSION OF ITS DEADLINE OF JANUARY FOURTEENTH TWENTY TWENTY TWO. HOUR DEADLINE HOWEVER IS STATUTORY THAT'S WHY WE'RE ASKING YOU TO AMANDA S. B. FIVE NINETY FOUR TO EXTEND OUR MAP ADOPTION DEADLINE TO THE SAME DATE JANUARY. FOURTEENTH OF TWENTY TWO. WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE SAME INDEPENDENT COMMISSION SIX THE SAME EXTENT STATUS THIRTY DAYS MOBILE NAVAL ARE CONDITIONS TO MORE THOROUGHLY ANALYZED THE DATA. AND ENSURE THAT THE NEW DISTRICTS PROTECT EVERYONE'S VOTING RIGHTS. IT ALSO GIVES THE COMMUNITY A GREATER OPPORTUNITY TO WEIGH IN. THE RESULTS WILL BE A BETTER FINAL MAP THAT HAS MORE PUBLIC BY FINALLY THE CURRENT STILL AMENDS AMPLE PROVISION THAT SAYS THAT ALL COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS MUST DRAW NEW DISTRICT MAPS EVERY DECADE. BUT THESE CHANGES DID NOT ACKNOWLEDGE THE BOWL OF INDEPENDENCE DISTRICTING COMMISSIONS LIKE THOSE IN LA AND SAN DIEGO COUNTIES. WE URGE THAT SECTION TWO OF THE BILL BE CLARIFIED BY NOTING IN SECTION TWENTY ONE FIVE HUNDRED PER AND A CLOSE. ABOUT ELECTIONS CODE THAT A COUNTY BOARD SAID OPTION OF A MAP IS ONLY APPLICABLE WHAT THE COUNTY HAS NO INDEPENDENT REDISTRICTING COMMISSION ESTABLISHED BY STATE LAW. WITH THOSE TWO AMENDMENTS THE L. A. COUNTY CITIZENS REDISTRICTING COMMISSION CAN AND WILL. SUPPORT THIS LEGISLATION THANK YOU VERY MR MIGHT WE WILL NOW MOVE ON TO ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OR IN OPPOSITION TO SB FIVE NINETY FOUR AS A REMINDER WE WILL HAVE A MAXIMUM OF THIRTY MINUTES IN TOTAL TIME FOR ADDITIONAL PUBLIC COMMENT ALL ADDITIONAL WITNESSES ARE LIMITED RIGHT IN THE NAME OF THE ORGANIZATION THEY REPRESENT IF ANY AND THEIR POSITION ON THE BILL WILL START THE COMMITTEE ROOM IS THERE ANYONE IN THE ROOM WHO WISHES TO PROVIDE A POSITION ON SB FIVE NINETY FOUR.

I THANK EACH YEAR BERMAN- A COUPLE THINGS IN RESPONSE TO SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT YOU HEARD THAT THIS MORNING- FIRST THE I THE CONCERNED BY THE L. A. I. COMMISSION AND I'D ALSO IT I'VE HEARD THAT THE CSU COULD COMMISSION THAT. THAT A PROVISION AUTHORIZING COUNTY REDISTRICTING BY RESOLUTION MIGHT SOMEHOW UNDO THE AUTHORITY OF THE COMMISSION TO DRAW LINES. I WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT- SB FIVE NINETY FOUR NO WAY ELIMINATES THEIR INDEPENDENT COMMISSION WORK OR GIVE THEIR BOARD OF SUPERVISORS THE ABILITY TO OVERTURN THE WORK OF THEIR COMMISSION- WE DON'T TOUCH ANY OF THE PROVISIONS RELATING TO THAT IN THIS BILL. I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THERE'S- LANGUAGE IN THE BILL THAT WOULD SUPPORT THAT CONCERN BUT I'M HAPPY TO MAKE IT CLEAR IN THE LEGISLATIVE HISTORY- THAT WE DON'T- AFFECT ANY OF THE ANYTHING THAT RELATED TO THAT CONCERN. AND SECONDLY. THE ISSUE OF TIME AND THE EXTENSION OF TIME WE ALL WOULD LIKE TO HAVE MORE TIME IN THIS PROCESS UNFORTUNATELY THAT'S BEEN THINGS THAT OUT OF OUR CONTROL THEY'VE KIND OF PUT US IN THIS CIRCUMSTANCE WHICH JUSTIFIES THE NEED FOR THIS BILL I WOULD NOTE THAT. THAT OUR STATE COMMISSION HAS TO DRAW LINES FOR A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SIX DISTRICTS AND THESE COUNTIES THAT HAVE RAISED CONCERNS I HAVE TO DROP FIVE. SOURCE IN SOME CASES SEVEN BUT MUCH FEWER SO I'M SENSITIVE TO THAT THEIR IMPORTANT WORK THAT THEY'RE UNDERTAKING TO MR MYATA THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE AND YOUR YOUR YOUR COLLEAGUES ON THE COMMISSION FOR THEIR SERVICE.

AND SECOND YEAR THANKS TO ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE CITIZEN COMMISSIONS ACROSS CALIFORNIA WHO ARE VOLUNTEERING THEIR TIME- TO IT TO HELP TRY TO MAKE OUR DISTRICTS REALLY REPRESENTATIVE OF THE COMMUNITIES THAT THEY LIVE IN- I WHICH I THINK IS SUCH IMPORTANT WORK. THE DELAYS IN THE RELEASE OF DATA FROM THE TWENTY TWENTY CENSUS OF PUSH BACK THE REDISTRICTING PROCESS LIKE YOU SAID CENTER AND UNFORTUNATELY THERE IS STILL UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THE STATE REDISTRICTING DEADLINE. NONETHELESS WITH THE LEGISLATIVE SESSION WINDING DOWN WE NEED TO MAKE ADJUSTMENTS NOW TO THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE REDISTRICTING PROCESS IN THE TWENTY TWENTY TWO ELECTION CALENDAR TO ACCOMMODATE A LATER DEADLINE. THE LANGUAGE IN THE BILL SEEKS TO BALANCE SEVERAL FACTORS INCLUDING ENSURING THAT ELECTIONS OFFICIALS OF SUFFICIENT TIME TO PREPARE FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY TWO PRIMARY ELECTION. SO ON NOBODY GOT EVERYTHING THAT THEY WANTED IN THIS BILL- I APPRECIATE THE COMPROMISES THAT NEED TO BE MADE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES AND I'M HAPPY TO RECOMMEND SUPPORT WITH THAT MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE VOTE.

SHERIN MEMBERS- AS YOU MAY KNOW THE COMMITTEE ALREADY HEARD AB FOURTEEN NINETY FIVE EARLIER THIS YEAR I'M THE EARLIER VERSION OF AB FOURTEEN NINETY FIVE WILL ENSURE THAT CALIFORNIA LAW IS CONSISTENT WITH THE SEVENTEENTH AMENDMENT OF THE U. S. CONSTITUTION BY PROVIDING FOR AN ELECTION TO BE HELD TO FILL A VACANCY AND CALIFORNIA'S. REPRESENTATION IN THE U. S. SENATE EVEN IF THE VACANCY OCCURS DURING THE LAST TWO YEARS OF THE U. S. SENATE TERM THE BILL THIS VERSION OF THE BILL WAS AMENDED IN THE SENATE- AND WHAT THE BILL DOES NOW IN ADDITION TO IT PREVIOUSLY DID. OF L. A. COUNTY IS CURRENTLY PILOTING A PROJECT USING AN ALTERNATE BALLOT ORDER WHERE LOCAL OFFICES APPEAR ON THE BALLOT BEFORE STATE AND FEDERAL OFFICES. IT'S UNCLEAR HOW THIS WOULD IMPACT PARTICIPATION WHEN A SPECIAL VACANCY ELECTION AND REELECTION WOULD APPEAR ON THE SAME BALLOT BUT IN DIFFERENT LOCATIONS ON THE BALLOT. AB FOURTEEN NINETY FIVE WILL ENSURE THAT WHEN THE SPECIAL VACANCY ELECTION AND A REGULAR ELECTION FOR THE SAME LEGISLATIVE OR CONGRESSIONAL SEAT APPEAR ON THE SAME BALLOT THAT VOTERS WILL BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY AND UNDERSTAND THIS BY PLACING THE TWO ELECTIONS AT THE FRONT OF THE BALLOT WITH CLEARLY MARKED HEADERS. THIS HELPS ELIMINATE VOTER CONFUSION ENSURES GREATER PARTICIPATION OF VOTERS AND HELPS REDUCE ELECTION COSTS THANK YOU GREAT THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER RIVAS.
