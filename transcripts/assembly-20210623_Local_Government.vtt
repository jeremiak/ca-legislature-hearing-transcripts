GOVERNMENT APPROVED PROGRAM.

01:41:02.089 --> 01:41:03.690
THAT REQUIRES NO MONEY DOWN.

01:41:03.757 --> 01:41:05.125
THE KEY SELLING POINT MADE TO

01:41:05.192 --> 01:41:06.560
CONSUMERS IS THAT PACE FINANCED

01:41:06.627 --> 01:41:08.295
HOME IMPROVEMENTS WILL PAY FOR

01:41:08.362 --> 01:41:09.196
THEMSELVES THROUGH ENERGY COST

01:41:09.263 --> 01:41:11.365
SAVINGS. SO IF THAT'S THE CASE

01:41:11.432 --> 01:41:12.399
THAT PACE INDUSTRY SHOULD

01:41:12.466 --> 01:41:15.936
WELCOME THE ACCOUNTABILITY OF

01:41:16.003 --> 01:41:16.537
AN UP FRONT SCALED DOWN ENERGY

01:41:16.603 --> 01:41:17.938
ASSESSMENT. UNFORTUNATELY WE

01:41:18.005 --> 01:41:19.440
KNOW THIS BUSINESS MODEL WE'VE

01:41:19.506 --> 01:41:20.474
HEARD COUNTLESS STORIES OF

01:41:20.541 --> 01:41:21.708
FRAUD ABUSE AND WHILE SOME OF

01:41:21.775 --> 01:41:23.477
YOU HAVE ASKED FOR DATA WE

01:41:23.544 --> 01:41:24.545
DON'T HAVE THAT IT'S NOT

01:41:24.611 --> 01:41:26.513
PUBLICLY AVAILABLE WE DO KNOW

01:41:26.580 --> 01:41:28.282
THAT CONSUMER ADVOCATES

01:41:28.348 --> 01:41:29.383
INCLUDING THE ONES THAT YOU'LL

01:41:29.450 --> 01:41:30.984
HEAR FROM. I HAVE REPEATEDLY

01:41:31.051 --> 01:41:32.453
TOLD US THAT THIS IS ONE OF THE

01:41:32.519 --> 01:41:34.421
TOP AREAS OF CONSUMER FRAUD

01:41:34.488 --> 01:41:36.590
THAT THEY HEAR ABOUT. HOMEOWNER

01:41:36.657 --> 01:41:38.058
PROMISED ENERGY SAVINGS THAT

01:41:38.125 --> 01:41:39.793
MAY NEVER MATERIALIZE. AND

01:41:39.860 --> 01:41:41.328
POTATO PATCH UPGRADES THEY MAY

01:41:41.395 --> 01:41:42.296
NOT NEED AND THEN LEFT ON THE

01:41:42.362 --> 01:41:45.065
HOOK. AFTER THE CONTRACTORS AND

01:41:45.132 --> 01:41:45.666
ADMINISTRATORS HAVE MADE THEIR

01:41:45.732 --> 01:41:48.268
PROFITS. SB FOUR SEVENTY SIX

01:41:48.335 --> 01:41:49.203
WOULD ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM HEAD

01:41:49.269 --> 01:41:50.838
ON BY REQUIRING A QUALIFIED

01:41:50.904 --> 01:41:52.206
THIRD PARTY TO PERFORM AN

01:41:52.272 --> 01:41:53.774
ENERGY AUDIT TO ENSURE THE

01:41:53.841 --> 01:41:54.942
IMPROVEMENTS TO THE HOME WILL

01:41:55.008 --> 01:41:56.743
REDUCE ENERGY CONSUMPTION. AND

01:41:56.810 --> 01:41:59.079
FOSSIL FUELS USE. A HOME ENERGY

01:41:59.146 --> 01:42:00.180
ASSESSMENT ARMS TO HOMEOWNERS

01:42:00.247 --> 01:42:01.448

01:42:01.515 --> 01:42:03.016
THE ENERGY USE IN THEIR HOME

01:42:03.083 --> 01:42:04.151
THE APPROPRIATENESS OF THE

01:42:04.218 --> 01:42:05.752
IMPROVEMENTS THEY ABOUT TO

01:42:05.819 --> 01:42:07.688
UNDERTAKE FOR THEIR HOUSEHOLD.

01:42:07.754 --> 01:42:08.989
ENERGY AUDITS ARE COMMON AND

01:42:09.056 --> 01:42:09.957
REQUIRED FOR OTHER ENERGY

01:42:10.023 --> 01:42:11.492

SAVINGS ASSISTANCE PROGRAM AS

01:42:17.231 --> 01:42:17.798
WELL AS IN THE COMMERCIAL PACE

01:42:17.865 --> 01:42:20.067
PROGRAM. NOW WE IN RESPONSE TO

01:42:20.133 --> 01:42:21.068
SOME OF THE CONCERNS WE HEARD

01:42:21.134 --> 01:42:22.536
ABOUT THIS AUDIT REQUIREMENT

01:42:22.603 --> 01:42:23.871
HAVE NARROWED THIS AUDIT

01:42:23.937 --> 01:42:24.304
REQUIREMENT PRETTY

01:42:24.371 --> 01:42:26.373
SIGNIFICANTLY- THE CURRENT

01:42:26.440 --> 01:42:28.242
VERSION THE BILL CLARIFIES-

01:42:28.308 --> 01:42:30.911
THAT. THE WHO CAN PERFORM THE

01:42:30.978 --> 01:42:33.046
AUDIT IS GOING TO BE VERY

01:42:33.113 --> 01:42:33.780
EXPANDED AND WE SCALE DOWN THE

01:42:33.847 --> 01:42:35.182
REQUIREMENTS FOR THAT. WE'VE

01:42:35.249 --> 01:42:35.983
NARROWED THE SCOPE OF THE

01:42:36.049 --> 01:42:37.818
ENERGY AUDIT BY REALLY ONLY

01:42:37.885 --> 01:42:39.653
REQUIRING AN ASSESSMENT OF THE

01:42:39.720 --> 01:42:40.721
PARTICULAR HOME IMPROVEMENTS

01:42:40.787 --> 01:42:43.557
BEING MADE- TO BE ASSESSED FOR

01:42:43.624 --> 01:42:45.392
SUITABILITY. AND WE ALLOWED A

01:42:45.459 --> 01:42:46.426
WAIVER OF THE AUDIT FOR

01:42:46.493 --> 01:42:47.728
EMERGENCY HOME IMPROVEMENTS

01:42:47.794 --> 01:42:50.731
THIS IS REALLY A SUITABILITY

01:42:50.797 --> 01:42:51.331
TESTS THAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR.

01:42:51.398 --> 01:42:53.500
UNDER THE CURRENT TEXT OF SB

01:42:53.567 --> 01:42:53.867
FOUR SEVENTY SIX

01:42:53.934 --> 01:42:55.669
CONSERVATIVELY- WE EXPECT THAT

01:42:55.736 --> 01:42:57.237
THERE OVER FIFTEEN HUNDRED

01:42:57.304 --> 01:42:58.105
QUALIFIED THIRD PARTY HOME

01:42:58.171 --> 01:42:59.907
ENERGY AUDITORS AND STATE. AND

01:42:59.973 --> 01:43:01.275
AT THE COST OF ENTRY FOR NEW

01:43:01.341 --> 01:43:03.010
AUDITORS WOULD BE VERY LOW. NOW

01:43:03.076 --> 01:43:04.111
YOU MAY HEAR FROM OPPONENTS OF

01:43:04.177 --> 01:43:05.045
THE L. YOU MAY HAVE HEARD FROM

01:43:05.112 --> 01:43:06.146
OPPONENTS OF THE BILL. THAT

01:43:06.213 --> 01:43:09.249
HOME ENERGY AUDITS CAN COST UP

01:43:09.316 --> 01:43:09.850
TO SIXTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS OR

01:43:09.917 --> 01:43:11.418
MORE. AND THAT IS SIMPLY NOT

01:43:11.485 --> 01:43:13.854
TRUE OF A TYPICAL INTERVIEW

01:43:13.921 --> 01:43:14.388
WHAT IT WOULD BE A HARD A

01:43:14.454 --> 01:43:16.256
COUPLE HUNDRED DOLLARS. BUT AS

01:43:16.323 --> 01:43:17.324
BEFORE SEVENTY SIX IS A

01:43:17.391 --> 01:43:18.959
REQUIREMENT. BECAUSE IT'S JUST

01:43:19.026 --> 01:43:20.427
BEEN NARROWED THE SUITABILITY

01:43:20.494 --> 01:43:21.395
REVIEW OF THE PROPOSED HOME

01:43:21.461 --> 01:43:22.896
IMPROVEMENTS. WILL BRING THAT

01:43:22.963 --> 01:43:24.097
DOWN WE'RE HOPING SOMETHING

01:43:24.164 --> 01:43:25.265
LIKE FIFTY DOLLARS OR HUNDRED

01:43:25.332 --> 01:43:26.567
DOLLARS. SOMETHING THAT BY THE

01:43:26.633 --> 01:43:28.201
WAY CAN BE ROLLED INTO THE PACE

01:43:28.268 --> 01:43:29.670
FINANCING IF THE PROJECT IS

01:43:29.736 --> 01:43:31.939
ULTIMATELY DECIDED TO BE USED

01:43:32.005 --> 01:43:33.607
IN A PACE. FINANCING STRUCTURE.

01:43:33.674 --> 01:43:34.908
THE SECOND IMPORTANT REFORM THE

01:43:34.975 --> 01:43:36.710
SB FOUR SEVENTY SIX MAKES IS

01:43:36.777 --> 01:43:37.644
HALTING PAYMENTS TO PACE

01:43:37.711 --> 01:43:39.446
CONTRACTOR. UNTIL A PROGRAM

01:43:39.513 --> 01:43:41.214
ADMINISTRATOR HAS OBTAINED

01:43:41.281 --> 01:43:42.115
COPIES OF PERMITS OR FINAL

01:43:42.182 --> 01:43:44.351
INSPECTIONS. TO VERIFY THAT ALL

01:43:44.418 --> 01:43:45.319
WORK HAS BEEN ADEQUATELY

01:43:45.385 --> 01:43:47.354
PERFORMED. RESIDENTIAL PACES

01:43:47.421 --> 01:43:48.989
MANY OF YOU KNOW HAS A HISTORY

01:43:49.056 --> 01:43:49.856
OF CONSUMER COMPLAINTS

01:43:49.923 --> 01:43:51.491
REGARDING UNFINISHED. OR AN

01:43:51.558 --> 01:43:52.793
ACCEPTABLE WORK AND

01:43:52.859 --> 01:43:54.328
IMPROVEMENTS THAT CONTRACTORS

01:43:54.394 --> 01:43:55.062
HAVE CHARGE FOR BUT NEVER

01:43:55.128 --> 01:43:57.097
INSTALLED. WELL THE GOALS OF

01:43:57.164 --> 01:43:58.532
PACE ARE ONES THAT ARE LAUDABLE

01:43:58.599 --> 01:43:59.499
AND IMPORTANT ONES THAT I

01:43:59.566 --> 01:44:01.768
SHARE. AFTER ALL WE DO WANT OUR

01:44:01.835 --> 01:44:03.670
HOMES GETTING TO- ENERGY

01:44:03.737 --> 01:44:05.405
EFFICIENCY IT'S IMPORTANT WAY

01:44:05.472 --> 01:44:07.474
TO TRY TO MEET OUR- AMBITIOUS

01:44:07.541 --> 01:44:09.242
ENERGY ZERO EMISSIONS ENERGY

01:44:09.309 --> 01:44:10.944
MANDATES IN THE STATE. THIS

01:44:11.011 --> 01:44:12.579
PROGRAM HAS UNFORTUNATELY BEEN

01:44:12.646 --> 01:44:13.547
MARRED WITH CONSUMER FRAUD AND

01:44:13.614 --> 01:44:15.816
ABUSE. THE PACE PROGRAM IS

01:44:15.882 --> 01:44:17.851
FAILING AND EVIDENCE ABOUNDS.

01:44:17.918 --> 01:44:19.219
THE ONLY THREE STATES AT THIS

01:44:19.286 --> 01:44:21.288
POINT STILL USE PACE CALIFORNIA

01:44:21.355 --> 01:44:23.056
MISSOURI AND FLORIDA. IN

01:44:23.123 --> 01:44:24.591
CALIFORNIA L. A. COUNTY HAS

01:44:24.658 --> 01:44:25.926
ALREADY ENDED ITS PACE PROGRAM

01:44:25.993 --> 01:44:27.060
AFTER DETERMINING THAT THE

01:44:27.127 --> 01:44:28.261
PROGRAM LACKED ADEQUATE

01:44:28.328 --> 01:44:29.930
CONSUMER PROTECTIONS. THE

01:44:29.997 --> 01:44:31.231
WESTERN RIVERSIDE COUNCIL

01:44:31.298 --> 01:44:32.466
GOVERNMENTS IS ENDING ITS PACE

01:44:32.532 --> 01:44:34.267
PROGRAM. AND JUST THIS MONTH

01:44:34.334 --> 01:44:36.370
AND THE FBI MOVE TO HAVE REP

01:44:36.436 --> 01:44:37.838

HOMEOWNERS IN SAN. DIEGO COUNTY

01:44:43.844 --> 01:44:44.411
WERE REPEATEDLY DEFRAUDED. IT'S

01:44:44.478 --> 01:44:45.012
CLEAR TO ME THAT THE SAID QUO

01:44:45.078 --> 01:44:46.680
IS NOT SUSTAINABLE AND EXPOSES

01:44:46.747 --> 01:44:47.280
CALIFORNIA HOMEOWNERS TO TOO

01:44:47.347 --> 01:44:49.249
MUCH RISK. NOW SOMEONE SAID

01:44:49.316 --> 01:44:49.950
THAT THIS BILL WOULD

01:44:50.017 --> 01:44:50.684
EFFECTIVELY END THE PACE

01:44:50.751 --> 01:44:52.786
PROGRAM IN CALIFORNIA. I ARGUE

01:44:52.853 --> 01:44:53.754
THAT IT DOES THE OPPOSITE THIS

01:44:53.820 --> 01:44:55.155
GIVES A LIFELINE THROUGH

01:44:55.222 --> 01:44:57.124
MEANINGFUL REFORMS. TO THIS

01:44:57.190 --> 01:44:58.792
PROGRAM THAT RIGHT NOW IS

01:44:58.859 --> 01:45:00.394
FAILING THE STATE WHERE WE HAVE

01:45:00.460 --> 01:45:01.828
TO ASK SERIOUS QUESTIONS ABOUT

01:45:01.895 --> 01:45:03.664
ITS FUTURE IN THE STATE. GIVEN

01:45:03.730 --> 01:45:05.699
ITS DIRECTION. NOW AGAIN I

01:45:05.766 --> 01:45:06.833
APOLOGIZE I REALLY WANTED TO

01:45:06.900 --> 01:45:08.201
TAKE THESE AMENDMENTS AYE I

01:45:08.268 --> 01:45:09.403
THOUGHT LONG AND HARD ABOUT

01:45:09.469 --> 01:45:11.371
THIS. BUT I DON'T WANT THIS

01:45:11.438 --> 01:45:13.006
BILL TO BE A SOMETHING THAT

01:45:13.073 --> 01:45:14.975
GETS PASSED WITHOUT MEANINGFUL

01:45:15.042 --> 01:45:16.109
CHANGES THAT WILL ACTUALLY

01:45:16.176 --> 01:45:17.144
ADDRESS THE LEVELS OF FRAUD

01:45:17.210 --> 01:45:18.311
THAT WERE SAYING. AND THEN

01:45:18.378 --> 01:45:19.980
ULTIMATELY HAVE THE INDUSTRY

01:45:20.047 --> 01:45:21.782
POINTED THIS BILL IN TWO YEARS

01:45:21.848 --> 01:45:24.017

01:45:24.084 --> 01:45:24.785
WE DON'T NEED FOR THE

01:45:24.851 --> 01:45:26.553

01:45:26.620 --> 01:45:27.487

01:45:27.554 --> 01:45:29.823

ENERGY AUDIT UP FRONT THIS

01:52:20.567 --> 01:52:22.735
WOULD HAVE BEEN AN ADDED COST

01:52:22.802 --> 01:52:24.104
AND WOULD HAVE BEEN CONFUSING

LESS APPEALING FOR MY FAMILY IN

RETIRE WITHOUT USING PACE AND

01:52:40.587 --> 01:52:41.688
WOULD HAVE HAD TO WORK LONGER

01:52:41.754 --> 01:52:43.389

HAPPY WITH WHY GRANT PASTE

01:52:54.901 --> 01:52:56.202
BECAUSE IT MADE OUR PROJECT

01:52:56.269 --> 01:52:58.605
AFFORDABLE. THE BEST PART WAS I

01:52:58.671 --> 01:52:59.873
DID NOT HAVE TO PAY ANY MONEY

01:52:59.939 --> 01:53:01.774
OUT OF POCKET. WHICH ALLOWED ME

01:53:01.841 --> 01:53:03.276
TO AVOID TAPPING INTO MY

01:53:03.343 --> 01:53:05.645
PRECIOUS RETIREMENT SAVINGS.

WHO WOULD LIKE TO MAKE UPGRADES

01:53:19.759 --> 01:53:21.461
TO THEIR HOME. AND PASTE COULD

01:53:21.528 --> 01:53:22.762
BE THEIR MOST COST EFFECTIVE

01:53:22.829 --> 01:53:25.498
OPTION. FORCING HOMEOWNERS TO

01:53:25.565 --> 01:53:27.133
PAY FOR AN ENERGY AUDIT OUT OF

01:53:27.200 --> 01:53:28.568
POCKET IS NOTHING MORE THAN

01:53:28.635 --> 01:53:30.470
ATTACK. THAT WOULD MAKE IT MORE

01:53:30.537 --> 01:53:31.604
DIFFICULT TO HELP PROPERTY

01:53:31.671 --> 01:53:34.307
OWNERS LIKE MYSELF. MAKE THEIR

01:53:34.374 --> 01:53:36.075

UNDERSTAND A NEW ASPECT THE

02:02:38.350 --> 02:02:39.085
PLACE THAT I DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT

02:02:39.151 --> 02:02:41.754
BEFOREHAND- I HAD A COUPLE

02:02:41.821 --> 02:02:42.922
QUESTIONS SOME OF THE

02:02:42.988 --> 02:02:43.989
OPPOSITION OF TALKED ABOUT THE

02:02:44.056 --> 02:02:47.426
FACT THAT- THE PIECE AUDIT IS

02:02:47.493 --> 02:02:49.695
NOT NOT CANNOT BE BUNDLED AND-

02:02:49.762 --> 02:02:52.698
THEM SORRY THE EFFICIENCY AUDIT

02:02:52.765 --> 02:02:54.066
CANNOT BE BUNDLED INTO THE PACE

02:02:54.133 --> 02:02:56.035
FINANCING YOU SAY IT IS COULD

02:02:56.102 --> 02:02:57.436
YOU EXPLAIN THAT AND THE SECOND

02:02:57.503 --> 02:02:59.238
QUESTION IS AROUND THE EQUITY

02:02:59.305 --> 02:03:01.173
ISSUE IN THE HOW WILL LOW

02:03:01.240 --> 02:03:02.541
INCOME CALIFORNIANS BE ABLE TO

02:03:02.608 --> 02:03:03.576
AFFORD THE ON IT I KNOW YOU'RE

02:03:03.642 --> 02:03:04.443
TRYING TO MAKE IT MORE

02:03:04.510 --> 02:03:05.711
AFFORDABLE YET BUT IF IT CAN'T

02:03:05.778 --> 02:03:07.880
BE BUNDLED IN. TO ANY SORT OF

02:03:07.947 --> 02:03:10.850
FINANCING HOW DO WE ENSURE THAT

02:03:10.916 --> 02:03:12.084
CALIFORNIANS OF ALL INCOME

02:03:12.151 --> 02:03:13.719
LEVELS CAN ACCESS THE FUNDING I

02:03:13.786 --> 02:03:15.254
APPRECIATE THE QUESTIONS THANK

02:03:15.321 --> 02:03:17.990
YOU VERY MUCH AND- MY STRONG

02:03:18.057 --> 02:03:18.858
UNDERSTANDING I'M HAPPIER FOR

02:03:18.924 --> 02:03:21.460
THIS TO MY WITNESSES HERE IS

02:03:21.527 --> 02:03:24.463
THAT THE- AUDIT OR THIS IS

02:03:24.530 --> 02:03:26.432
SUITABILITY AUDIT CAN BE ROLLED

02:03:26.499 --> 02:03:28.267
INTO THE FINANCING SO THE MAIN

02:03:28.334 --> 02:03:29.969
QUESTION IS WHAT YOU DO IF THE

02:03:30.035 --> 02:03:31.737
CONSUMER THE HOUSEHOLD DECIDES

02:03:31.804 --> 02:03:32.471
NOT TO PROCEED WITH PACE

02:03:32.538 --> 02:03:34.740
FINANCING- AND OF COURSE THAT

02:03:34.807 --> 02:03:36.208
DOES PRESENT OBSTACLE NOW WE

02:03:36.275 --> 02:03:37.977
WANT TO MAKE CLEAR WE HAVE NOT

02:03:38.043 --> 02:03:39.245
SAID THE CONSUMER HAS TO PAY

02:03:39.311 --> 02:03:41.080
FOR THIS. WE BELIEVE THAT- IT

02:03:41.147 --> 02:03:43.282
COULD BE THE PUBLIC FINANCING

02:03:43.349 --> 02:03:44.550
AND MANY CITIES HAVE ADOPTED

02:03:44.617 --> 02:03:45.951
PROGRAMS LIKE THIS AS WAS

02:03:46.018 --> 02:03:46.452
MENTIONED IN ONE OF THE

02:03:46.519 --> 02:03:48.053
WITNESSES TESTIMONIES I COULD

02:03:48.120 --> 02:03:49.255
BE THE CONTRACTOR THEMSELVES IT

02:03:49.321 --> 02:03:51.023
COULD BE THE PACE PROGRAM OKAY

02:03:51.090 --> 02:03:52.958
MISTER- WE'RE TALKING ABOUT I

02:03:53.025 --> 02:03:54.360
ONLY CLEAR WHAT WE ENVISION

02:03:54.426 --> 02:03:56.095
HERE IS A STRIPPED DOWN

02:03:56.162 --> 02:03:57.329
SUITABILITY STANDARD AND WE

02:03:57.396 --> 02:03:58.798
HAVE MADE NUMEROUS AMENDMENTS

02:03:58.864 --> 02:04:00.366
I'M WE DONE THAT WITHOUT ANY

02:04:00.432 --> 02:04:02.601
FEEDBACK FROM- INDUSTRY BECAUSE

02:04:02.668 --> 02:04:03.769
THEY HAVE REFUSED TO WORK WITH

02:04:03.836 --> 02:04:06.238
US ON THIS AT ALL AND SO- WE

02:04:06.305 --> 02:04:08.340
HAVE MADE ALL THESE AMENDMENTS

02:04:08.407 --> 02:04:08.974
ON OUR OWN TRYING TO MAKE THIS

02:04:09.041 --> 02:04:10.743
A BETTER BILL- WE ACTUALLY

02:04:10.810 --> 02:04:11.744
OFFERED AT ONE POINT WE WERE

02:04:11.811 --> 02:04:13.245
STILL WILLING TO CONSIDER THIS.

02:04:13.312 --> 02:04:14.814
ESSENTIALLY A PRO FORMA SOLAR

02:04:14.880 --> 02:04:16.448
CHECK SO THAT IT WOULD JUST BE

02:04:16.515 --> 02:04:17.383
SOMETHING WITH WE KNOW THE

02:04:17.449 --> 02:04:18.717
NUMBER OF SOLAR PANELS WE KNOW

02:04:18.784 --> 02:04:19.885
HOW MUCH EFFICIENCY WE CAN LOOK

02:04:19.952 --> 02:04:21.520
AT SOME OF THE ELECTRIC BILL

02:04:21.587 --> 02:04:22.354
AND SEE IF IT'S SUITABLE FOR

02:04:22.421 --> 02:04:23.989
THEM WITHOUT EVEN HAVING

02:04:24.056 --> 02:04:24.623
SOMEONE COME TO YOUR HOME BUT

02:04:24.690 --> 02:04:26.058
AGAIN WE HAD NO RESPONSE TO

02:04:26.125 --> 02:04:28.694
THESE- REPEATED- ENTREATIES TO

02:04:28.761 --> 02:04:33.432
THE OTHER SIDE. BUT OUR GOAL

02:04:33.499 --> 02:04:33.999
HERE IS TO MAKE THIS LIKE A

02:04:34.066 --> 02:04:34.600
FIFTY DOLLAR OUR- ENERGY. FOR

02:04:34.667 --> 02:04:35.267
MOST TYPE OF PROJECTS OR LESS-

02:04:35.334 --> 02:04:36.735
WE ENVISION A WIDE POOL OF

02:04:36.802 --> 02:04:39.038
AUDITORS- AND OF COURSE I AGAIN

02:04:39.104 --> 02:04:40.940
I'M I'M- FAIRLY CLEAR THIS IS

02:04:41.006 --> 02:04:42.608
SOMETHING WE- ASK FOR THE VERY

02:04:42.675 --> 02:04:43.809
OUTSET. I ASKED PERSONALLY

02:04:43.876 --> 02:04:45.377
ABOUT. CAN THIS BE ROLLED UP IN

02:04:45.444 --> 02:04:46.478
THE FINANCING I WAS TOLD

02:04:46.545 --> 02:04:47.379
ABSOLUTELY YES BY LET'S

02:04:47.446 --> 02:04:49.048
COUNCIL. I WAS TOLD YES BY OUR

02:04:49.114 --> 02:04:50.482
SPONSORS BUT I'D LIKE TO REFER

02:04:50.549 --> 02:04:55.387
THIS QUESTION- TO MY WITNESSES-

02:04:55.454 --> 02:04:58.023
SO JENNIFER OR STACY IF EITHER

02:04:58.090 --> 02:04:58.624
OF YOU COULD TAKE THAT ON I'D

02:04:58.691 --> 02:05:01.894
APPRECIATE IT. YES AND THIS IS

02:05:01.961 --> 02:05:03.495
STACEY TACTIC IN AND TO TAKE

02:05:03.562 --> 02:05:05.631
THAT ISSUE ON- I WOULD STATE

02:05:05.698 --> 02:05:06.599
THAT I DO BELIEVE THAT

02:05:06.665 --> 02:05:08.033
FINANCING COULD BE SET UP IN

02:05:08.100 --> 02:05:09.702
SUCH A WAY THAT THE COST FOR

02:05:09.768 --> 02:05:11.070
THE ENERGY AUDIT COULD BE

02:05:11.136 --> 02:05:13.205
ROLLED INTO THE FINANCING. AT

02:05:13.272 --> 02:05:15.541
ORIGINATION IN FACT THE PLANS

02:05:15.608 --> 02:05:17.610
THAT DO REQUIRE ENERGY AUDITS

02:05:17.676 --> 02:05:19.478
FOR RESIDENTIAL PAY FINANCING

02:05:19.545 --> 02:05:20.980
ALREADY HAVE THIS FEATURE THAT

02:05:21.046 --> 02:05:22.114
INCLUDES WITH FANNIE MAE

02:05:22.181 --> 02:05:24.850
FREDDIE MAC FHA. IN COMMERCIAL

02:05:24.917 --> 02:05:26.752
PACE AND SO GIVEN THE FACT THAT

02:05:26.819 --> 02:05:28.387
IT HAS BEEN ACHIEVED WITHIN

02:05:28.454 --> 02:05:30.022
THOSE AREAS PROGRAM WE THINK

02:05:30.089 --> 02:05:31.757
THAT THAT CAN ALSO BE ACHIEVED

02:05:31.824 --> 02:05:33.692
HERE WITHIN THAT TRANSACTION.

02:05:33.759 --> 02:05:35.361
IN ADDITION TO THAT WE REALLY

02:05:35.427 --> 02:05:36.762
DO HAVE TO LOOK AT THE COST

02:05:36.829 --> 02:05:38.931
BEING AVOIDED BY THE HOMEOWNERS

02:05:38.998 --> 02:05:40.699
WHO ARE UP SOLD INSTEAD MORE

02:05:40.766 --> 02:05:43.068
EXPENSE. IMPROVEMENT THAN WHAT

02:05:43.135 --> 02:05:45.471
THE ENERGY AUDIT REVEALED THOSE

02:05:45.537 --> 02:05:46.672
IMPROVEMENTS WOULD ACTUALLY

02:05:46.739 --> 02:05:48.440
GAIN FOR THEM THAT'S THE VALUE

02:05:48.507 --> 02:05:50.743
OF THE AUDIT IS TO ENSURE THAT

02:05:50.809 --> 02:05:52.778
IF A LOW INCOME HOMEOWNER IS

02:05:52.845 --> 02:05:54.947
TAKING ON DEBT. IN ORDER TO

02:05:55.014 --> 02:05:56.215
FINANCE ENERGY EFFICIENT

02:05:56.282 --> 02:05:58.484
PRODUCTS THAT IN THE END OF

02:05:58.550 --> 02:05:59.919
THOSE PRODUCTS ARE GOING TO PAY

02:05:59.985 --> 02:06:01.120
FROM THEMSELVES AND THEY'RE

02:06:01.186 --> 02:06:02.454
GOING TO SEE THAT SAVINGS IN

02:06:02.521 --> 02:06:04.590
THEIR UTILITY BILLS. ENSURING

02:06:04.657 --> 02:06:06.492
THAT THE FINANCING IS ACTUALLY

02:06:06.558 --> 02:06:12.431
AFFORDABLE FOR THEM AND. WILL

02:06:12.498 --> 02:06:13.565
NOT RESULT IN THE LOSS IS THAT.

02:06:13.632 --> 02:06:20.606
DURABLE. BUT IT IS A CRISIS-

02:06:20.673 --> 02:06:23.909
SORRY JUST SAY FINE FINE- SO

02:06:23.976 --> 02:06:25.978
WHAT THAT THAT DOES A LEVY

02:06:26.045 --> 02:06:27.212
EIGHT SOME OF MY CONCERNS I

02:06:27.279 --> 02:06:28.414
THINK THAT NEEDS TO BE MORE

02:06:28.480 --> 02:06:29.982
EXPLICIT IT'S NOT VERY

02:06:30.049 --> 02:06:32.184
COMFORTING TO BE HERE AND THE

02:06:32.251 --> 02:06:33.686
OTHER HOUSING HERE WE BELIEVE

02:06:33.752 --> 02:06:35.721
IT WILL LEAD WHAT WE NEED TO BE

02:06:35.788 --> 02:06:38.791
ABLE TO HEAR IS IT WILL BE

02:06:38.857 --> 02:06:39.925
RIGHT NOT WE BELIEVE THAT ARE

02:06:39.992 --> 02:06:41.894
YOU KNOW. WELL TO FAR FOR THAT

02:06:41.961 --> 02:06:42.394
I KNOW YOU HAVE ANOTHER

02:06:42.461 --> 02:06:44.496
COMMITTEE TO GO AND- I HAVE TO

02:06:44.563 --> 02:06:46.598
BE HONEST I WAS NOT GOING TO

02:06:46.665 --> 02:06:48.300
VOTE FOR THIS BILL YESTERDAY

02:06:48.367 --> 02:06:49.935
AND THEN I GOT A TEXT FROM MY

02:06:50.002 --> 02:06:52.104
SISTER THAT EXACTLY THE FRAUD

02:06:52.171 --> 02:06:52.738
YOU'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS THAT

02:06:52.805 --> 02:06:54.907
THIS BILL. WAS HAPPENING TO MY

02:06:54.974 --> 02:06:58.344
MOTHER WELL SO- I THINK IT IS

02:06:58.410 --> 02:06:59.812
MORE PREVALENT THAN WE THINK

02:06:59.878 --> 02:07:00.546
AND I THINK WE HAVE TO DO

02:07:00.612 --> 02:07:02.781
SOMETHING ABOUT THIS OF SELLING

02:07:02.848 --> 02:07:03.682
TO A SEVENTY EIGHT YEAR OLD

02:07:03.749 --> 02:07:06.218
WOMAN WHO IS FIT BUT MAYBE YOU

02:07:06.285 --> 02:07:08.387
KNOW AS- YOU KNOW MAKING

02:07:08.454 --> 02:07:10.456
DIFFERENT CALCULATIONS IS. AS

02:07:10.522 --> 02:07:12.658
TAKING ADVANTAGE OF SOME PEOPLE

02:07:12.725 --> 02:07:13.592
WHO SHOULD NOT BE TAKEN

02:07:13.659 --> 02:07:15.828
ADVANTAGE OF FOR THE PURPOSE OF

02:07:15.894 --> 02:07:17.663
I THINK WHAT WE WANT WITH THE

02:07:17.730 --> 02:07:19.898
ENERGY EFFICIENCY- THAT PAYS

02:07:19.965 --> 02:07:21.867
PROVIDE SO WITH THAT I WILL

02:07:21.934 --> 02:07:23.769
MOVE THE BILL SO IT CAN BE

02:07:23.836 --> 02:07:25.604
CONSIDERED FURTHER COMMITTEE

02:07:25.671 --> 02:07:26.805
BUT I DO RESERVE THE RIGHT TO

02:07:26.872 --> 02:07:27.940
VOTE ON THE FLOOR IF WE CAN'T

02:07:28.007 --> 02:07:29.408

THAT IT ALREADY IS ROLLED UP

02:07:44.123 --> 02:07:46.191
AND I THINK. THAT THE WITNESS

02:07:46.258 --> 02:07:47.526
TUTS TESTIMONY WAS THAT IN

02:07:47.593 --> 02:07:49.495
OTHER ENERGY AUDIT PROGRAMS- IT

ALREADY IS ROLLED UP AND SO- I

02:07:51.964 --> 02:07:52.931
BELIEVE HAS ALWAYS BEEN IT. IT

02:07:52.998 --> 02:07:53.899
WILL BE THAT WAS THE INTENT OF

02:07:53.966 --> 02:07:56.635
THE BILL AND IF IT'S NOT CLEAR

02:07:56.702 --> 02:07:57.202
RIGHT NOW I AM HAPPY TO MAKE

CONSTITUENTS THAT ARE- MAJORITY

02:08:44.650 --> 02:08:46.618
LOW INCOME THAT THEY HAVE TO

02:08:46.685 --> 02:08:48.120
PAY FOR SO IT'S AN ADDITIONAL

02:08:48.187 --> 02:08:52.524
COST TO THE HOMEOWNER- AND WHAT

02:08:52.591 --> 02:08:55.694
IS THIS AUDIT IS THIS. IS THE

02:08:55.761 --> 02:08:56.862
HOMEOWNER NOW GOING TO NOW SAY

02:08:56.929 --> 02:08:59.531
NO TO THE CONTRACTOR BECAUSE OF

02:08:59.598 --> 02:09:01.867
THIS AUDIT HOWEVER WE ASSURING

02:09:01.934 --> 02:09:04.670
THAT. THIS IS GOING TO WIN FOR

02:09:04.736 --> 02:09:06.905
BETTER INFORM THE HOMEOWNER I

02:09:06.972 --> 02:09:08.707
APPRECIATE THE QUESTION- AND

02:09:08.774 --> 02:09:10.309
JUST AGAIN AS FAR AS HOW WE

02:09:10.375 --> 02:09:11.643
ENVISION YOU GOT IT IT'S REALLY

02:09:11.710 --> 02:09:12.744
KIND OF A SUITABILITY STANDARD

02:09:12.811 --> 02:09:13.512
RIGHT WE LOOK AT THE DIFFERENT

02:09:13.579 --> 02:09:15.547
MOVING PARTS OF YOU KNOW

02:09:15.614 --> 02:09:17.616
SOMEBODY THAT THIS IS NOT MEANT

02:09:17.683 --> 02:09:19.184
TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM OF I THINK

02:09:19.251 --> 02:09:20.319
ONE OF THE OPPOSITION WITNESSES

02:09:20.385 --> 02:09:21.553
WHO KNEW THAT SHE WANTED PAY

02:09:21.620 --> 02:09:23.322
SHE DONE HER OWN RESEARCH THIS

02:09:23.388 --> 02:09:24.756
IS MEANT TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM

02:09:24.823 --> 02:09:25.991
OF THE COLD CALL TO THE

02:09:26.058 --> 02:09:27.359
GRANDMOTHER THAT CONTRACTORS

02:09:27.426 --> 02:09:28.861
WALKING DOOR TO DOOR. AND

02:09:28.927 --> 02:09:29.728
HITTING PEOPLE UP AND

02:09:29.795 --> 02:09:31.563
MISLEADING THEM AS TO WHAT THIS

02:09:31.630 --> 02:09:32.664
IS ABOUT AND THE PROBLEM OF

02:09:32.731 --> 02:09:34.366
COURSE IS THAT PACE IS NOT A

02:09:34.433 --> 02:09:36.235
NORMAL FINANCING PROGRAM IT

02:09:36.301 --> 02:09:37.736
CREATES A SUPER SENIOR LEAN

02:09:37.803 --> 02:09:39.838
BACON CALLS FORECLOSURE OR

02:09:39.905 --> 02:09:41.240
OTHER PROBLEMS RIGHT IF YOU

02:09:41.306 --> 02:09:43.242
DON'T PAY IT CREATES ALL SORTS

02:09:43.308 --> 02:09:44.676
ATTENTION AND BECAUSE IT HAS

02:09:44.743 --> 02:09:45.744
THE GOVERNMENT'S IMPRIMATUR

02:09:45.811 --> 02:09:47.779
BEHIND IT IT IS MARKETED AS A

02:09:47.846 --> 02:09:49.815
GOVERNMENT PROGRAM I AND IT'S

02:09:49.882 --> 02:09:51.950
BEEN RIFE WITH ABUSE I GUESS

02:09:52.017 --> 02:09:53.852
THE CASE I'D MAKE IS THAT ONE

02:09:53.919 --> 02:09:56.788
I'D BE HAPPY TO EXPLORE PUBLIC-

02:09:56.855 --> 02:09:57.389
FUNDING FOR THIS I THINK THERE

02:09:57.456 --> 02:09:59.291
ARE ALREADY. PROGRAMS THAT DO

02:09:59.358 --> 02:10:01.093
THIS UTILITIES DO THIS CITIES

02:10:01.160 --> 02:10:02.995
DO THIS I I'M TOLD THAT PC MAY

02:10:03.061 --> 02:10:04.429
HAVE FUNDS THAT WE CAN ALLOCATE

02:10:04.496 --> 02:10:06.064
TOWARDS THIS PURPOSE BUT ALSO I

02:10:06.131 --> 02:10:06.965
GUESS IF WE'RE THINKING ABOUT

02:10:07.032 --> 02:10:08.634
THIS THIS WAY WHAT IS FIFTY

02:10:08.700 --> 02:10:10.802
DOLLARS OR SO IN THE CONTEXT OF

02:10:10.869 --> 02:10:11.803
A SEVERAL THOUSAND DOLLAR

02:10:11.870 --> 02:10:13.572
PROJECT WHEN IT'S ROLLED UP ALL

02:10:13.639 --> 02:10:15.607
TOGETHER WHEN YOU AMORTIZE THAT

02:10:15.674 --> 02:10:16.441
OVER THE LIFETIME OF THE CASE

02:10:16.508 --> 02:10:18.710
ALONE I THINK THAT GIVEN THE

02:10:18.777 --> 02:10:20.312
SCALE OF FRAUD WERE SAYING YOU

02:10:20.379 --> 02:10:21.146
KNOW TALKING ABOUT PENNIES PER

02:10:21.213 --> 02:10:22.981
MONTH RIGHT. BUT TO GIVE US

02:10:23.048 --> 02:10:24.917
COMFORT THAT THIS IS PREVENTING

02:10:24.983 --> 02:10:25.884
THE TYPES OF FRAUD THAT WE'RE

02:10:25.951 --> 02:10:27.653
SEEING I WOULDN'T PROPOSED THIS

02:10:27.719 --> 02:10:32.357
IF THIS PROGRAM WAS PRISTINE.

02:10:32.424 --> 02:10:32.958
AND WE YOU KNOW EVERYBODY WITH

02:10:33.025 --> 02:10:33.559
HAD THE EXPERIENCE OF THE ONE

02:10:33.625 --> 02:10:34.193
OPPOSITION WHEN. THE PROBLEM IS

02:10:34.259 --> 02:10:35.127
THAT WE'RE SO TO PEOPLE GET THE

02:10:35.194 --> 02:10:37.129
FRIED AND YOU HEARD- ONE OF MY

02:10:37.196 --> 02:10:38.897
WITNESSES SAY. THAT THIS IS THE

02:10:38.964 --> 02:10:39.865
MOST COMMON THING THEY'RE

02:10:39.932 --> 02:10:41.200
SAYING THAT THEIR BACKLOG WITH

02:10:41.266 --> 02:10:42.834
COMPLAINTS THIS IS A REAL ISSUE

02:10:42.901 --> 02:10:43.869
WE DON'T HAVE HARD NUMBERS ON

02:10:43.936 --> 02:10:45.704
HOW MANY. WE JUST KNOW THAT

02:10:45.771 --> 02:10:46.738
IT'S OVERWHELMING CONSUMER

02:10:46.805 --> 02:10:47.973
ADVOCATES. AND IT'S ONE OF THE

02:10:48.040 --> 02:10:49.274
REASONS I DECIDED TO TAKE THIS

02:10:49.341 --> 02:10:50.709
ON AS A FRESHMAN. NOT

02:10:50.776 --> 02:10:52.144
NECESSARILY REALIZING HOW

02:10:52.211 --> 02:10:53.078
INTENSE THE POLITICS AROUND

02:10:53.145 --> 02:10:55.147
THIS WOULD BE- BUT BUT I THINK

02:10:55.214 --> 02:10:56.381
THIS IS A RIGHTEOUS BILL I

02:10:56.448 --> 02:10:57.249
THINK THAT WE'RE TRYING TO

02:10:57.316 --> 02:10:58.850
CREATE SOMETHING THAT PROVIDE A

02:10:58.917 --> 02:11:00.419
MEANINGFUL CHECK. UP FRONT.

02:11:00.485 --> 02:11:01.620
THAT SAYS OKAY IS THIS AN

02:11:01.687 --> 02:11:03.488
APPROPRIATE PROJECT FOR YOU.

02:11:03.555 --> 02:11:05.857
FOR YOUR LEVEL FINANCES- FORGET

02:11:05.924 --> 02:11:06.892
WHAT YOUR ELECTRIC BILL IS WILL

02:11:06.959 --> 02:11:08.060
IT PROVIDE ENERGY AND

02:11:08.126 --> 02:11:09.027
TREATMENTS WILL SAVE YOU MONEY

02:11:09.094 --> 02:11:10.095
AT THE END OF THE DAY. AND

02:11:10.162 --> 02:11:11.597
THESE ARE ALL WORTHWHILE GOALS

02:11:11.663 --> 02:11:12.631
IN THE CONTEXT OF THE TYPES OF

02:11:12.698 --> 02:11:13.932
FRAUD WERE SAYING. AND

02:11:13.999 --> 02:11:15.100
ALTERNATELY I BELIEVE THIS WILL

02:11:15.167 --> 02:11:16.602
SAVE ON AVERAGE THE AVERAGE

02:11:16.668 --> 02:11:18.570
CONSUMER MONEY IT MAY COST. THE

02:11:18.637 --> 02:11:20.272
OPPOSITION WITNESS A FEW

02:11:20.339 --> 02:11:21.039
PENNIES A MONTH IF YOU WILL SET

02:11:21.106 --> 02:11:22.641
UP IN THE PACE. BUT IT WILL

02:11:22.708 --> 02:11:23.976
SAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE THE

02:11:24.042 --> 02:11:26.678
HEARTACHE OF HAVING THE STRESS

02:11:26.745 --> 02:11:28.080
THE TENSION OF THE BEING

02:11:28.146 --> 02:11:29.448
DEFRAUDED. BY THE MANY

02:11:29.514 --> 02:11:30.182
SCAMSTERS THAT ARE OUT THERE

02:11:30.249 --> 02:11:32.317
UNFORTUNATELY. I'M SO AGAIN I'M

02:11:32.384 --> 02:11:34.119
HAPPY TO WORK PERFECT AS I

02:11:34.186 --> 02:11:35.020
WOULD EMPHASIZE THAT WE'VE BEEN

02:11:35.087 --> 02:11:36.722
KIND OF WORKING THROUGH THIS ON

02:11:36.788 --> 02:11:38.690
OUR OWN BECAUSE- INDUSTRY HAS

02:11:38.757 --> 02:11:39.658
NOT WORKED WITH US ON THIS

02:11:39.725 --> 02:11:40.759
AUDIT THEY'VE TAKEN A HARD

02:11:40.826 --> 02:11:41.893
POSITION FROM THERE TO VERY

02:11:41.960 --> 02:11:43.328
BEGINNING. THAT THEY WILL NOT

02:11:43.395 --> 02:11:45.063
ACCEPT ANY OUT OF ANY KIND NO

02:11:45.130 --> 02:11:46.398
MATTER HOW MUCH WE TRY TO

02:11:46.465 --> 02:11:47.799
TAILOR THIS TO JUST BE AS

02:11:47.866 --> 02:11:49.601
MINIMAL A BURDEN AS POSSIBLE.

02:11:49.668 --> 02:11:50.836
BUT I DO BELIEVE THERE IS A

02:11:50.902 --> 02:11:53.005
REAL PROBLEM IN THIS INDUSTRY-

02:11:53.071 --> 02:11:54.373
AND THAT AN AUDIT ALONG WITH

02:11:54.439 --> 02:11:56.074
THE BACK AND HOME INSPECTION

02:11:56.141 --> 02:11:57.342
PRONG THAT WE'RE REQUIRING THIS

02:11:57.409 --> 02:11:58.777
BILL AS WELL. WILL HELP MAKE

02:11:58.844 --> 02:12:02.347
MEANINGFUL PROGRESS. TO

02:12:02.414 --> 02:12:02.948
CRACKING DOWN ON THE FRONT OR

02:12:03.015 --> 02:12:04.016
SING. I AGREE WITH YOU. IF YOU

02:12:04.082 --> 02:12:05.817
KNOW THE AUDIT IF YOU HAVE MORE

02:12:05.884 --> 02:12:08.086
DETAILS ON HOW THE AUDIT THE-

02:12:08.153 --> 02:12:10.088
COST. ME KEEP SAYING FIFTY

02:12:10.155 --> 02:12:12.324
DOLLARS BUT- I'M NOT. SURE

02:12:12.391 --> 02:12:13.659
WHERE THAT NUMBER IS COMING

02:12:13.725 --> 02:12:15.460
FROM. IT'S MIKE MY HEAD INFO

02:12:15.527 --> 02:12:16.728
WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO WIN YEAH

02:12:16.795 --> 02:12:18.764
YOU ENVISION THAT I THINK OUT

02:12:18.830 --> 02:12:19.765
FIFTY DOLLARS. SEEMS VERY

02:12:19.831 --> 02:12:21.967
REASONABLE. BUT I'M NOT SURE.

02:12:22.034 --> 02:12:23.535
WELL I DON'T HAVE ANY DATA THAT

02:12:23.602 --> 02:12:25.237
SHOWS HOW MUCH. WHAT IS THE

02:12:25.304 --> 02:12:27.172
TRUE COST OF THESE AUDIBLES. I

02:12:27.239 --> 02:12:29.341
LIVE IN A RURAL COUNTY YEAH-

02:12:29.408 --> 02:12:31.643
AND SOMEONE HAS TO COME FROM.

02:12:31.710 --> 02:12:33.879
TWO HOURS AWAY. UP TO PERFORM

02:12:33.945 --> 02:12:35.647
AN AUDIT YEAH. HOW MUCH IS THAT

02:12:35.714 --> 02:12:37.249
GOING TO BE IS IT REALLY ONLY

02:12:37.316 --> 02:12:39.318
GOING TO BE FIFTY DOLLARS. YEAH

02:12:39.384 --> 02:12:40.385
I THINK IT WOULD BE DIFFERENT

02:12:40.452 --> 02:12:42.087
IF THERE WERE STATE PROGRAM.

02:12:42.154 --> 02:12:44.022

FIFTY DOLLARS. AND SO. THAT TO

02:12:48.427 --> 02:12:50.028
ME ISN'T CLEAR UP THIS BILL IF

02:12:50.095 --> 02:12:52.497

02:12:55.400 --> 02:12:58.170
YOUR WHOLE. THE SOLUTION RIGHT.

02:12:58.236 --> 02:12:59.438
TO PREVENT TEEN IT'S HAPPENED

02:12:59.504 --> 02:13:01.239
MORE FRAUD YEAH. AND YOU KNOW I

02:13:01.306 --> 02:13:03.241
KNOW THAT UTILITIES AND OTHERS

02:13:03.308 --> 02:13:04.776
MAYBE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE

02:13:04.843 --> 02:13:06.812
THESE. AUDIT PROGRAMS. I KNOW

02:13:06.878 --> 02:13:08.046
THERE ARE THEIR COMMONALITY

02:13:08.113 --> 02:13:09.815

02:13:09.881 --> 02:13:11.416
UTILITIES THAT GO OUT TO YOUR

ESPECIALLY TO A LOW INCOME.

02:13:15.487 --> 02:13:17.689
CONSUMER I KNOW MY MOM WHEN

02:13:17.756 --> 02:13:19.658
SHE- HAD HER OWN HOME. THERE

02:13:19.725 --> 02:13:21.059
WAS AN AUDITOR THAT CAME OUT

02:13:21.126 --> 02:13:22.861
AND MADE SUGGESTIONS FOR ENERGY

02:13:22.928 --> 02:13:24.730

KNOW THE COST TO THE- HOMEOWNER

02:13:31.703 --> 02:13:33.138
I THINK THAT. IT COULD BE

02:13:33.205 --> 02:13:34.506
CREATING MAY BE MORE FRONT END

02:13:34.573 --> 02:13:36.475

02:14:42.374 --> 02:14:44.609
YOUR HOUSE AND SAYS WE WANT TO

02:14:44.676 --> 02:14:46.778
DO- SOLAR PANELS WHICH IS THE

02:14:46.845 --> 02:14:47.646
MOST COMMON TYPE OF HOME

02:14:47.712 --> 02:14:49.714
IMPROVEMENT. WE WOULD ONLY LOOK

02:14:49.781 --> 02:14:52.184
AT THAT- AND I DO BELIEVE AND

02:14:52.250 --> 02:14:53.852
WE ALSO LOWERED THE STANDARDS

02:14:53.919 --> 02:14:55.720
FOR WHAT THE REQUIREMENTS FOR A

02:14:55.787 --> 02:14:57.088
ENTERED ENERGY AUDITOR OF THIS

02:14:57.155 --> 02:14:58.824
TYPE NEEDS NEEDS TO HAVE TO BE

02:14:58.890 --> 02:15:00.492
ABLE TO DO THIS SO ACCORDING

02:15:00.559 --> 02:15:01.460
AND I'M HAPPY TO REFER THIS

02:15:01.526 --> 02:15:02.761
MIGHT MIGHT WITNESSES BECAUSE

02:15:02.828 --> 02:15:04.896
THEY HAVE MORE DETAILS BUT- WE

02:15:04.963 --> 02:15:05.931
ESTIMATE THAT WE'RE GONNA HAVE

02:15:05.997 --> 02:15:07.599
A LOT MORE PEOPLE THAT ARE

02:15:07.666 --> 02:15:08.900
ELIGIBLE TO DO THESE ARTISTS

02:15:08.967 --> 02:15:09.868
YOU WON'T HAVE PEOPLE DRIVING

02:15:09.935 --> 02:15:11.203
FROM TWO HOURS AWAY EVEN IN THE

02:15:11.269 --> 02:15:13.171
RURAL COUNTIES- IN THE INLAND

02:15:13.238 --> 02:15:14.606
COUNTIES. THAT WE WILL HAVE A

02:15:14.673 --> 02:15:17.142
LOT MORE ELIGIBLE PEOPLE TO DO

02:15:17.209 --> 02:15:19.044
THIS TYPE OF SCALE DOWN ENERGY

02:15:19.110 --> 02:15:20.545
AUDIT AGAIN AS I MENTIONED I AM

02:15:20.612 --> 02:15:22.848
HAPPY TO CONSIDER AMENDMENTS TO

02:15:22.914 --> 02:15:24.716
DO A PRO FORMA SOLAR ASSESSMENT

02:15:24.783 --> 02:15:26.051
SO THAT THAT IS YOU KNOW NOT

02:15:26.117 --> 02:15:27.219
EVEN REQUIRING IT NECESSARILY

02:15:27.285 --> 02:15:29.321
IN IN PERSON INSPECTION WE HAVE

02:15:29.387 --> 02:15:30.322
AN OPEN TO THESE TYPES OF

02:15:30.388 --> 02:15:32.257
CHANGES- WE DO BELIEVE THAT'LL

02:15:32.324 --> 02:15:33.925
DRIVE THE COST DOWN FROM THAT

02:15:33.992 --> 02:15:34.493
TWO HUNDRED DOLLAR LEVEL TO

02:15:34.559 --> 02:15:35.760
SOMETHING BELOW THAT I CAN'T

02:15:35.827 --> 02:15:36.661
TELL YOU WITH ANY CERTAINTY

02:15:36.728 --> 02:15:38.129
WHAT THAT'LL BE. BECAUSE THIS

02:15:38.196 --> 02:15:39.898
IS MARKET FORCES AT PLAY RIGHT

02:15:39.965 --> 02:15:41.500
SUPPLYING DEMAND PRETTY SIMPLE

02:15:41.566 --> 02:15:42.801
CONCEPT SO THAT I WOULD LOVE TO

02:15:42.868 --> 02:15:44.336
TURN IT OVER TO- ONE OF MY

02:15:44.402 --> 02:15:47.305
WITNESSES TO HELP ARTICULATE- A

02:15:47.372 --> 02:15:49.040
BETTER ANSWER FOR THIS-

02:15:49.107 --> 02:15:54.045
JENNIFER. OR STATION IF YOU

02:15:54.112 --> 02:15:56.147
HAVE A RESPONSE. I'M YES THIS

02:15:56.214 --> 02:15:57.749
IS STACEY TODD- AGAIN SPEAKING

02:15:57.816 --> 02:16:00.085
ADDS TO AND KIND OF THE

02:16:00.151 --> 02:16:03.622
AVAILABILITY AND- HOME ENERGY

02:16:03.688 --> 02:16:05.223
RATERS AND SO HERE IN

02:16:05.290 --> 02:16:07.526
CALIFORNIA WE DO HAVE A AT HERS

02:16:07.592 --> 02:16:10.028
RATERS AND THEY'RE ACTUALLY AND

02:16:10.095 --> 02:16:11.963
HAD THEIR PROVIDERS TO ASK FOR

02:16:12.030 --> 02:16:13.164
THAT TRAINING AND AUTHORIZATION

02:16:13.231 --> 02:16:14.633
OF THAT IS ACTUALLY ALREADY

02:16:14.699 --> 02:16:16.268
OVERSEEN BY THE CALIFORNIA

02:16:16.334 --> 02:16:18.103
ENERGY COMMISSION- THERE'S A

02:16:18.169 --> 02:16:19.571
HANDBOOK INTO A MANUAL THAT

02:16:19.638 --> 02:16:21.239
SPECIFICALLY OUTLINE EXACTLY

02:16:21.306 --> 02:16:22.908
WHAT THE AUDITED TO CHEAT.

02:16:22.974 --> 02:16:23.975
ANOTHER THING THAT WE HAVE TO

02:16:24.042 --> 02:16:25.544
KEEP IN MIND IS WHAT THE AUDIT

02:16:25.610 --> 02:16:27.479
IS TRYING TO DO HERE FOR OUR

02:16:27.546 --> 02:16:29.281
HOMEOWNERS IS THEY'RE ACTUALLY

02:16:29.347 --> 02:16:31.750
TRYING TO SHOW THAT THE ENERGY

02:16:31.816 --> 02:16:33.418
AUDIT ESTABLISHES THE STATE

02:16:33.485 --> 02:16:35.287
INTO INVESTMENT RATIO IS

02:16:35.353 --> 02:16:36.721
GREATER THAN ONE WHAT THAT

02:16:36.788 --> 02:16:38.557
MEANS IS IN OTHER WORDS THAT

02:16:38.623 --> 02:16:40.125
THE SAVINGS ACHIEVED BY THAT

02:16:40.191 --> 02:16:41.626
FINANCED IMPROVEMENTS OVER THE

02:16:41.693 --> 02:16:43.995
TERM. MUST OUTWEIGH THE COST OF

02:16:44.062 --> 02:16:45.730
THOSE IMPROVEMENTS AND THAT

02:16:45.797 --> 02:16:47.132
ENSURED THAT THE HOMEOWNER

02:16:47.198 --> 02:16:48.833
DIRECTLY BENEFIT FROM THAT THE

02:16:48.900 --> 02:16:50.569
REDUCTION IN THEIR UTILITY

02:16:50.635 --> 02:16:52.904
COSTS AND ALSO IT ENSURES THAT

02:16:52.971 --> 02:16:54.239
THE MORTGAGE LENDERS DO NOT

02:16:54.306 --> 02:16:56.074
HAVE INCREASED RISK. DUE TO

02:16:56.141 --> 02:16:57.842
THAT HE SAID STUPOR PRIORITY

02:16:57.909 --> 02:17:00.412
LIEN STATUS IN ADDITION TO THAT

02:17:00.478 --> 02:17:02.447
AND LOOKING AT THE AVAILABILITY

02:17:02.514 --> 02:17:04.416
LET STATE AND THEN- OUT IN THAT

02:17:04.482 --> 02:17:05.984
SITUATION IN WHICH A HOMEOWNER

02:17:06.051 --> 02:17:08.653
MAY NOT MOVE FORWARD WITH- THE

02:17:08.720 --> 02:17:10.655
ACTUAL FINANCING IN INSTEAD OF

02:17:10.722 --> 02:17:12.223
OUT OF POCKET WERE THESE ENERGY

02:17:12.290 --> 02:17:13.658
AUDIT. IF YOU LOOK AT THE

02:17:13.725 --> 02:17:16.161
EFFECTIVENESS OF ENERGY AUDIT

02:17:16.227 --> 02:17:18.163
THEY ATUALLY SHOWN TO PROVIDE

02:17:18.229 --> 02:17:20.999
YOU WITH AND YOU COULD SAVE UP

02:17:21.066 --> 02:17:23.001
25230% ON YOUR ENERGY BILLS

02:17:23.068 --> 02:17:24.903
THEY MAKING EVEN SMALL CHANGES

02:17:24.970 --> 02:17:26.504
AND SMALL AND EFFICIENCY

02:17:26.571 --> 02:17:28.273
IMPROVEMENTS I WITHIN THE

02:17:28.340 --> 02:17:29.774
PROPERTY WHICH IS WHY AS

02:17:29.841 --> 02:17:31.676
SENATOR MEN MENTION. THERE ARE

02:17:31.743 --> 02:17:33.678
ALREADY A NUMBER OF FREE OR NO

02:17:33.745 --> 02:17:35.480
COST ENERGY AUDIT PROGRAMS THAT

02:17:35.547 --> 02:17:36.915
ARE OUT THERE THAT WOULD BE

02:17:36.982 --> 02:17:38.516
THEN AVAILABLE TO LOW INCOME

02:17:38.583 --> 02:17:39.818
CONSUMERS AND THAT INCLUDES

02:17:39.884 --> 02:17:42.020
THOSE THROUGH UTILITY AS THEY

02:17:42.087 --> 02:17:44.756
OFFERED THAT FREE ENERGY AUDITS

02:17:44.823 --> 02:17:45.991
THERE'S OTHER PROGRAMS WITHIN

02:17:46.057 --> 02:17:47.659
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT DO

02:17:47.726 --> 02:17:48.960
THAT AS WELL. AND THEN IN

02:17:49.027 --> 02:17:51.429
ADDITION TO THAT THERE HAVE

02:17:51.496 --> 02:17:52.764
BEEN AND YOU GET THE POLITIES

02:17:52.831 --> 02:17:54.499
THAT IS SPECIFICALLY I HAVE

02:17:54.566 --> 02:17:57.002
REYES DOLLARS FOR ENERGY AUDIT

02:17:57.068 --> 02:17:58.336
BECAUSE THAT INCREASES OUR

02:17:58.403 --> 02:18:06.444
OVERALL GOALS AND ACHIEVING-

02:18:06.511 --> 02:18:07.312
EFFICIENCY I'M AND MOST TIMES

02:18:07.379 --> 02:18:08.446
THAT PUBLIC VETTING. THROUGH AS

02:18:08.513 --> 02:18:09.514
TEXT ME BLOCK GRANT AND OTHER

02:18:09.581 --> 02:18:11.082
WAY AND WE TO REDO THE COSTS. I

02:18:11.149 --> 02:18:12.851
TO THE HOME DOING I WOULD JUST.

02:18:12.917 --> 02:18:14.219
THIS IS ALREADY A REGULATED

02:18:14.286 --> 02:18:16.021
INDUSTRY THAT CAN PROVIDE

02:18:16.087 --> 02:18:18.056
SIGNIFICANT BENEFITS WHETHER OR

02:18:18.123 --> 02:18:19.724
NOT THE HOMEOWNER GOES FORWARD

02:18:19.791 --> 02:18:21.860
WITH THE PEACE FINANCING AND IT

02:18:21.926 --> 02:18:23.361
REALLY SERVICES THAT CHECKED

02:18:23.428 --> 02:18:25.630
AGAINST THE PREDATORY PRACTICES

02:18:25.697 --> 02:18:26.464
THAT WE'VE SEEN THAT THERE IS A

02:18:26.531 --> 02:18:28.299
SPOT ALL. HELP TO PERPETUATE

02:18:28.366 --> 02:18:30.135
WITHIN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

02:18:30.201 --> 02:18:31.936
AND SO WE DO BELIEVE AGAIN IT

02:18:32.003 --> 02:18:34.873
CAN BE LOW COST AND THAT IT IS-

02:18:34.939 --> 02:18:37.042
AN ESSENTIAL ASSESSMENTS TO

02:18:37.108 --> 02:18:39.844
ENSURE THAT THESE CAPE BATMAN.

02:18:39.911 --> 02:18:41.279
WORKABLE FOR THE LOW INCOME

02:18:41.346 --> 02:18:42.781
HOMEOWNERS WHO MAY NEED TO

02:18:42.847 --> 02:18:44.616
UTILIZE THEM. IF I COULD JUST

02:18:44.683 --> 02:18:47.686
ADD ONE OTHER AND- JENNIFER BUT

02:18:47.752 --> 02:18:48.987
THEN FOR ABOUT ABOUT IT AND

02:18:49.054 --> 02:18:50.321
WELL I WAS LOOKING AT THE OTHER

02:18:50.388 --> 02:18:51.690
POINT THAT I THINK THE OTHER

02:18:51.756 --> 02:18:52.557
THING THAT THE AUDIT CAN BE A

02:18:52.624 --> 02:18:53.825
CHECK ON AND I WOULD LEADING TO

02:18:53.892 --> 02:18:55.960
THE TO MY COMMENT. IS A REALLY

02:18:56.027 --> 02:18:59.431
RAMPANT- YOU KNOW PRICE GOUGING

02:18:59.497 --> 02:19:01.266
THAT HAPPENS IN THIS PROGRAM

02:19:01.332 --> 02:19:03.268
AND SO IF YOU'RE YOU KNOW. IN

02:19:03.334 --> 02:19:04.769
TALKING ABOUT THAT RATIO OF THE

02:19:04.836 --> 02:19:07.038
COST TO THE SAVINGS. YOU KNOW A

02:19:07.105 --> 02:19:08.773
CONTRACTOR WHO CAN AT TELL YOU

02:19:08.840 --> 02:19:10.041
SOMETHING AT THE MAXIMUM

02:19:10.108 --> 02:19:12.043
POSSIBLE PRICE THAT THEY CAN

02:19:12.110 --> 02:19:12.677
GET AWAY WITH THROUGH THE PAID

02:19:12.744 --> 02:19:14.446
PROGRAM. THAT'S PROBABLY NOT

02:19:14.512 --> 02:19:15.413
GOING TO BE ENERGY EFFICIENT

02:19:15.480 --> 02:19:16.548
FOR THE HOMEOWNER BUT THAT

02:19:16.614 --> 02:19:17.282
WOULDN'T CREEK INCREASED

02:19:17.348 --> 02:19:19.484
COMPETITION AMONG CONTRACTORS

02:19:19.551 --> 02:19:21.586
IN CURRENT ON ITS CONTRACTORS

02:19:21.653 --> 02:19:23.054
TO GET INTO THE PROGRAM. AND

02:19:23.121 --> 02:19:24.456
ACTUALLY GET HOMEOWNERS YOU

02:19:24.522 --> 02:19:26.958
KNOW ACCURATE HONEST PRICING

02:19:27.025 --> 02:19:27.959
FOR THE KINDS OF PRODUCTS THAT

02:19:28.026 --> 02:19:29.327
THEY MIGHT ACTUALLY WANT TO GO

02:19:29.394 --> 02:19:30.395
FORWARD WITH THAT MIGHT

02:19:30.462 --> 02:19:32.197
ACTUALLY SAVE THEM MONEY OVER

02:19:32.263 --> 02:19:34.265
THE LONG TERM. AFFORD FOUR

02:19:34.332 --> 02:19:35.300
THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR THREE

02:19:35.366 --> 02:19:37.368
CLEARLY. YOU KNOW. YOU'RE NEVER

02:19:37.435 --> 02:19:39.003
GOING TO MAKE THAT BACK BUT AT

02:19:39.070 --> 02:19:40.105
THE SAME A DIFFERENT CONTRACTOR

02:19:40.171 --> 02:19:42.407
MIGHT. MAKE A DIFFERENCE-

02:19:42.474 --> 02:19:44.042
ESTIMATE FOR YOU FOR A LAUGH

02:19:44.109 --> 02:19:45.076
THAT MIGHT BE SOMETHING THAT

02:19:45.143 --> 02:19:46.244
YOU WOULD GO FORWARD WITH AND

02:19:46.311 --> 02:19:48.146
YOU MIGHT USE CASE FINANCING UP

02:19:48.213 --> 02:19:49.647
TO OBTAIN THE PRODUCT THAT AND

02:19:49.714 --> 02:19:52.150
I HAD MORE EQUITABLE COST. IF I

02:19:52.217 --> 02:19:52.851
COULD JUST ADD ONE QUICK POINT

02:19:52.917 --> 02:19:54.486
ON TO THAT- WE AS I MENTIONED

02:19:54.552 --> 02:19:56.121
WE TOOK AMENDMENTS TO LOWER THE

02:19:56.187 --> 02:19:57.756
THRESHOLD AND TO CLARIFY WHAT

02:19:57.822 --> 02:19:59.224
TYPE OF SCALE DOWN AUDIT WE'RE

02:19:59.290 --> 02:20:06.965
LOOKING FOR- A AND EVEN IF

02:20:07.031 --> 02:20:07.565
THERE WERE NO ADDITIONAL ALL.

02:20:07.632 --> 02:20:09.234
THE PEOPLE THAT. DID THAT AT A

02:20:09.300 --> 02:20:09.868
PLAN TO QUALIFY TO DO THESE OUT

02:20:09.934 --> 02:20:11.336
OF. THEY'RE CURRENTLY FIFTH

02:20:11.402 --> 02:20:11.970
HUNDRED FIFTY SAID INSPECTOR IN

02:20:12.036 --> 02:20:13.004
THIS. GIVEN THAT THE ARE JUST

02:20:13.071 --> 02:20:13.605
OVER TWELVE TO. PAGE PROJECTS

02:20:13.671 --> 02:20:14.773
COMPLETED IN TWENTY NINETEEN

02:20:14.839 --> 02:20:16.374
LAST PRE OPENED YEAR. THAT WE

02:20:16.441 --> 02:20:17.609
SAY THAT THERE'S ONE AUDITOR

02:20:17.675 --> 02:20:19.043
FOR EVERY NINE CASE PROJECTS

02:20:19.110 --> 02:20:20.044
OUT THERE AND THAT'S ASSUMING

02:20:20.111 --> 02:20:21.880
AGAIN. THAT NOBODY ELSE APPLIES

02:20:21.946 --> 02:20:24.849
TO DO THESE TYPES OF. STRIPPED

02:20:24.916 --> 02:20:25.416
DOWN PACE ARTISTS THAT WE'RE

02:20:25.483 --> 02:20:28.086
TALKING ABOUT- THERE ANY OTHER

02:20:28.153 --> 02:20:29.587
QUESTIONS YES- ASSEMBLY MEMBER

02:20:29.654 --> 02:20:32.891
ALMOST. YOU OF MADAM CHAIR AND

02:20:32.957 --> 02:20:34.025
I THINK YOU CENTER FOR BRINGING

02:20:34.092 --> 02:20:36.261
THIS ISSUE. I SAID ON THE SAN

02:20:36.327 --> 02:20:37.362
DIEGO COUNTY BOARD OF

02:20:37.428 --> 02:20:38.596
SUPERVISORS AND CHAIRED THE SAN

02:20:38.663 --> 02:20:40.398
MARINO TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY

02:20:40.465 --> 02:20:43.168
PACE PROGRAMS WAS A TOPIC WE'RE

02:20:43.234 --> 02:20:44.636
GOING THROUGH MORE ON THE

02:20:44.702 --> 02:20:45.804
LEAVES THAT THEY'RE PUTING ON

02:20:45.870 --> 02:20:47.939
THE HOMES WHEN THEY TRIED TO

02:20:48.006 --> 02:20:48.540
RESELL THOSE HOMES ARE SELDOM

02:20:48.606 --> 02:20:50.809
HOMES. SO WE ENDED UPBY

02:20:50.875 --> 02:20:52.177
CREATING A SUBORDINATE

02:20:52.243 --> 02:20:53.945
SUBORDINATION CLAUSE THAT WAS

02:20:54.012 --> 02:20:56.347
IN THERE THAT WAS ACCEPTED-

02:20:56.414 --> 02:20:57.982
WHEN THOSE LEADS ARE PUT ON

02:20:58.049 --> 02:20:58.783
THERE SO THAT THE HOMEOWNER

02:20:58.850 --> 02:21:00.852
COULD CHARGE WILL MOVE FORWARD

02:21:00.919 --> 02:21:01.886
AND THEN THE COST IT WAS OR

02:21:01.953 --> 02:21:03.855
WASN'T THE FIRST ITEM ON THE

02:21:03.922 --> 02:21:06.391
LEAD- AND NOW I'M LOOKING AT

02:21:06.457 --> 02:21:07.926
WHAT'S COMING FORWARD I DO HAVE

02:21:07.992 --> 02:21:09.761
SOME SOME CONCERNS. OVER THE

02:21:09.828 --> 02:21:11.196
COST OF THE AUDIT THAT WOULD

02:21:11.262 --> 02:21:13.064
COME INTO THE HOMEOWNER YOU

02:21:13.131 --> 02:21:15.166
MENTIONED THAT THERE'S- THE

02:21:15.233 --> 02:21:17.468
HIGH COST OF SIXTEEN HUNDRED

02:21:17.535 --> 02:21:19.237
AND A LOW COST OF TWO HUNDRED

02:21:19.304 --> 02:21:20.805
YES EVEN IF YOU TRY TO FIND

02:21:20.872 --> 02:21:22.807
AVERAGE COST AIR DOESN'T EQUATE

02:21:22.874 --> 02:21:23.775
TO THE FIFTY DOLLARS THAT YOU

02:21:23.842 --> 02:21:25.844
TALKED ABOUT WHAT THAT YOU ALSO

02:21:25.910 --> 02:21:27.712
TALKED ABOUT SCALING DOWN THE

02:21:27.779 --> 02:21:29.814
AUDIT TO CERTAIN AREAS. SO MY

02:21:29.881 --> 02:21:31.416
QUESTION IS WHEN YOU SCALE IT

02:21:31.482 --> 02:21:33.318
DOWN TO CERTAIN AREAS THE

02:21:33.384 --> 02:21:36.054
NUMBERS THAT YOU IDENTIFY WITH

02:21:36.120 --> 02:21:37.589
SIXTEEN HUNDRED BEING THE HIGH

02:21:37.655 --> 02:21:38.189
TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS BEING THE

02:21:38.256 --> 02:21:40.191
LOW IS THAT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT

02:21:40.258 --> 02:21:42.026
THAT SCALE DOWN ON IT BUT NOW

02:21:42.093 --> 02:21:44.195
THAT YOU ARE PRESENTING OF TO

02:21:44.262 --> 02:21:45.730
THIS COMMITTEE. SO JUST TO

02:21:45.797 --> 02:21:46.831
CLARIFY ASSEMBLY MEMBER I

02:21:46.898 --> 02:21:48.600
APPRECIATE THE QUESTION- THE

02:21:48.666 --> 02:21:49.500
SIXTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS WAS NOT

02:21:49.567 --> 02:21:50.568
MY FIGURE THAT CAME FROM

02:21:50.635 --> 02:21:52.704
INDUSTRY HI THERE THAT'S THAT'S

02:21:52.770 --> 02:21:55.039
THE NUMBER. YOU'RE FIGURE WAS

02:21:55.106 --> 02:21:56.975
FIFTY DOLLARS NO I ALSO I WENT

02:21:57.041 --> 02:21:58.409
RIGHT JUST TO CLARIFY AND CLEAR

02:21:58.476 --> 02:22:00.111
IF I GET RESPONSE- THE INDUSTRY

02:22:00.178 --> 02:22:01.579
HAS SAID THAT THESE ARE WHOLE

02:22:01.646 --> 02:22:03.014
HOME ENERGY AUDITS THE SOUP TO

02:22:03.081 --> 02:22:04.515
NUTS EXAMINING EVERYTHING YOUR

02:22:04.582 --> 02:22:05.984
HOME FOR ENERGY EFFICIENCIES

02:22:06.050 --> 02:22:07.485
ARE SIXTEEN HUNDRED I WOULD I

02:22:07.552 --> 02:22:08.987
WAS CLARIFYING WAS THAT WE

02:22:09.053 --> 02:22:10.255
BELIEVE THAT NUMBER IS GROSSLY

02:22:10.321 --> 02:22:11.890
INFLATED THAT ACCORDING TO

02:22:11.956 --> 02:22:13.925
CONSUMER WEBSITES. IT THESE

02:22:13.992 --> 02:22:15.460
AUDITS COST BETWEEN TWO HUNDRED

02:22:15.527 --> 02:22:16.828
AND SEVEN HUNDRED DOLLARS AGAIN

02:22:16.895 --> 02:22:18.062
THAT'S THE WHOLE HOME ENERGY

THE AVERAGE BEING ABOUT FOUR

02:22:22.367 --> 02:22:23.601
HUNDRED DOLLARS MMM RIGHT NOW

02:22:23.668 --> 02:22:24.669
THAT'S AGAIN A WHOLE HOME

02:22:24.736 --> 02:22:25.970
ENERGY AUDIT LOOKING AT

02:22:26.037 --> 02:22:27.972
EVERYTHING IN YOUR HOME. WHAT

WE ARE TALKING LIKE THERE'S. A

02:22:34.746 --> 02:22:35.313
PROJECT SPECIFIC ENERGY AUDITS-

02:22:35.380 --> 02:22:36.514
IF THE CONTRA COMES IN PROPOSES.

02:22:36.581 --> 02:22:37.215
YOU KNOW CHANGING WINDOWS TO

02:22:37.282 --> 02:22:38.416
ENTER EFFICIENT WINDOW. ADDING

02:22:38.483 --> 02:22:39.584
SHE YOUR PATH IS THE OPPOSITE

02:22:39.651 --> 02:22:41.052
WINS FIVE OKAY WHAT WHAT ARE

02:22:41.119 --> 02:22:42.954
THE INNER. PUT IN. ASSOCI WITH

02:22:43.021 --> 02:22:45.290
THOSE PROPOSED. IMPROVEMENTS

02:22:45.356 --> 02:22:47.125
RIGHT AND HOW DO THEY FIT IN

02:22:47.191 --> 02:22:48.259
WITH YOUR ENERGY USAGE WITH

02:22:48.326 --> 02:22:49.827
YOUR INCOME. AND ALL THAT

02:22:49.894 --> 02:22:51.596

YOU SEE THIS THAT'S THAT'S WHAT

02:22:52.964 --> 02:22:54.165
THE AUTO. IN OUR CASE WE DO SO

02:22:54.232 --> 02:22:55.633
IT'S NOT A WHOLE HOME ON IT.

02:22:55.700 --> 02:22:57.468
WILL BE NARROWLY TAILORED TO

02:22:57.535 --> 02:22:59.671
THE PERSON SPECIFIC PROJECT-

02:22:59.737 --> 02:23:02.273
pI PULL FIFTY THAT'S JUST KIND

02:23:02.340 --> 02:23:03.775
OF LIKE. A GUESSTIMATE MY

02:23:03.841 --> 02:23:05.643
ASPIRATIONAL GOAL THAT IS NOT A

02:23:05.710 --> 02:23:06.878
FIGURE THAT I HAVE ANY DATA

02:23:06.945 --> 02:23:08.346
FOR. BUT I THINK IF YOU DO THE

02:23:08.413 --> 02:23:09.747
MATH AND YOU SAY OKAY HOME HOME

02:23:09.814 --> 02:23:11.382
AUDIT COSTS BETWEEN TWO HUNDRED

02:23:11.449 --> 02:23:12.650
AND SEVEN HUNDRED DOLLARS.

02:23:12.717 --> 02:23:13.518
THAT'S SOMEONE COMING OUT

02:23:13.584 --> 02:23:14.886
SPENDING SEVERAL HOURS IN YOUR

02:23:14.953 --> 02:23:15.987
HOME LOOKING AT EVERYTHING OUT

02:23:16.054 --> 02:23:17.689
THERE. VERSUS SOMEONE JUST

02:23:17.755 --> 02:23:19.023
COMING TO LOOK AT A SPECIFIC

02:23:19.090 --> 02:23:21.326
PROJECT- I WOULD IMAGINE THAT

02:23:21.392 --> 02:23:22.260
THE JUST GIVEN THE TIME

02:23:22.327 --> 02:23:23.528
CONSTRAINTS AND ALL THAT IT

02:23:23.594 --> 02:23:25.430
WOULD BE A LOT LESS. AND AGAIN

02:23:25.496 --> 02:23:27.365
I WANT TO JUST REPEAT THE POINT

02:23:27.432 --> 02:23:28.900
THAT. I HAVE OFFERED TO THE

02:23:28.967 --> 02:23:30.735
OTHER SIDE. HAVING SOLAR WHICH

02:23:30.802 --> 02:23:32.036
AGAIN IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST

02:23:32.103 --> 02:23:33.271
TYPES OF ENERGY IMPROVEMENTS

02:23:33.338 --> 02:23:35.073
ASSOCIATE WITH PACE. TO HAVE

02:23:35.139 --> 02:23:36.641
THAT BE A PRO FORMA CHECK A BOX

02:23:36.708 --> 02:23:37.909
BECAUSE I DON'T THINK YOU NEED

02:23:37.976 --> 02:23:38.676
TO HAVE SOMEONE NECESSARILY

02:23:38.743 --> 02:23:39.844
COME OUT TO YOUR HOME YOU CAN

02:23:39.911 --> 02:23:40.645
KIND OF LOOK AT YOUR LACK OF

BILL. YOU CAN LOOK AT- DTI

02:23:42.680 --> 02:23:44.682
ANOTHER. SIX AND JUST GAUGE

02:23:44.749 --> 02:23:46.017
LIKE WHAT THEY NEED AS FAR AS

02:23:46.084 --> 02:23:47.685
SOLAR AND BE ABLE TO PROVIDE

02:23:47.752 --> 02:23:48.686
THAT WITHOUT A ACTUAL

02:23:48.753 --> 02:23:50.088
INSPECTION SO. I'VE OFFERED

02:23:50.154 --> 02:23:50.989
THAT AS WELL AND WILLING TO

02:23:51.055 --> 02:23:52.924
STOKE ENTERTAIN THAT- BUT THE

02:23:52.991 --> 02:23:54.258
GOAL HERE IS TO TRY TO MAKE THE

02:23:54.325 --> 02:23:55.426
AUDIT NARROWLY TAILORED AND IS

02:23:55.493 --> 02:23:56.527
CHEAPEST POSSIBLE BECAUSE WE'RE

02:23:56.594 --> 02:23:58.296
NOT TRYING TO MAKE SOMETHING

02:23:58.363 --> 02:23:59.030
THAT. FIRST PEOPLE FROM USING

02:23:59.097 --> 02:24:00.698
THE PROGRAM. WE'RE TRYING TO

02:24:00.765 --> 02:24:01.966
MAKE SOMETHING THAT- PROVIDES

02:24:02.033 --> 02:24:03.434
FARMS CONSUMERS WITH NECESSARY

02:24:03.501 --> 02:24:04.869
INFORMATION PROVIDED A CHECK

02:24:04.936 --> 02:24:06.504
AGAINST THE TYPES OF FRAUD THAT

02:24:06.571 --> 02:24:07.839
ARE UNFORTUNATELY FAR TOO

02:24:07.905 --> 02:24:09.874
RAMPANT WITH THIS PROGRAM. NOT

02:24:09.941 --> 02:24:11.976
INTENTIONAL EFFORT I MEAN TO ME

02:24:12.043 --> 02:24:13.478
TO BE ABLE TO PROTECT THE HOME

02:24:13.544 --> 02:24:14.912
OWNER RIGHT NOW. JUST LIKE WE

02:24:14.979 --> 02:24:16.447
DID WITH THE LEANS OVER PLAYING

02:24:16.514 --> 02:24:18.082
ON THEIR HOMES. HOWEVER DO YOU

02:24:18.149 --> 02:24:20.218
HAVE DATA THAT SHOWS. THAT

02:24:20.284 --> 02:24:21.486
HOMEOWNERS AND WHAT THEY'RE

02:24:21.552 --> 02:24:23.554
ACTUALLY ASKING- THROUGH THESE

02:24:23.621 --> 02:24:25.757
PASTE GRAMS OR THE MINIMAL TO

02:24:25.823 --> 02:24:27.392
WHAT YOU SCALE DOWN TO A WINDOW

02:24:27.458 --> 02:24:33.731
OR TO THE WIDER SCALE. RIGHT

02:24:33.798 --> 02:24:34.098
OUT OF THE COST IT'S THEIR- IF

02:24:34.399 --> 02:24:35.600
YOUR GOAL IS A- TO FOR. DOLLAR

02:24:35.666 --> 02:24:37.668
THAT YOU. AGREED IT'S ONLY A

02:24:37.735 --> 02:24:39.370
MINIMAL COMPONENT THAT AVERAGE

02:24:39.437 --> 02:24:40.872
USERS ARE GETTING. YEAH WITHIN

02:24:40.938 --> 02:24:42.473
THIS PROJECT THAT WILL BRING UP

02:24:42.540 --> 02:24:43.641
TO FIFTY DOLLARS DO YOU KNOW.

02:24:43.708 --> 02:24:46.344
WHAT THAT. THAT AVERAGE- ASK

02:24:46.411 --> 02:24:48.146
IS. OF THE HOMEOWNER FROM THE

02:24:48.212 --> 02:24:50.782
PROVIDER- I DON'T THINK WE HAVE

02:24:50.848 --> 02:24:51.949
THE DATA AND THAT IS NOT AGAIN

02:24:52.016 --> 02:24:53.451
AS I SAID. PUBLICLY AVAILABLE

02:24:53.518 --> 02:24:54.919
DATA ON AROUND THE PACE

02:24:54.986 --> 02:24:56.521
PROGRAMS NOT BEAR. ONE OF

02:24:56.587 --> 02:24:57.488
THINGS WE'RE HOPING IS THAT THE

02:24:57.555 --> 02:24:59.090
FBI WILL COME UP WITH THAT DATA

02:24:59.157 --> 02:25:00.091
AND I THINK THEY'RE IN THE

02:25:00.158 --> 02:25:01.459
PROCESS. POST CODE OF

02:25:01.526 --> 02:25:03.461
DEVELOPING PLANS TO DO THAT-

02:25:03.528 --> 02:25:04.495
WE'VE HEARD INSTANCES WHERE

02:25:04.562 --> 02:25:06.364
HOMEOWNERS GET. AND IT'S PART

02:25:06.431 --> 02:25:07.465
OF THE SOMETIMES YOU HAVE THE

02:25:07.532 --> 02:25:08.399
CASE THE HOMEOWNER REQUESTING

02:25:08.466 --> 02:25:10.001
REPAIR. OTHER TIMES ITS

02:25:10.068 --> 02:25:11.636
CONTRACTORS. KIND OF DUPING

02:25:11.702 --> 02:25:13.204
HOMEOWNERS AND PROJECTS SO.

02:25:13.271 --> 02:25:14.439
WE'VE HEARD REPORTS OF HUNDREDS

02:25:14.505 --> 02:25:15.773
OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS OF HOME

02:25:15.840 --> 02:25:17.175
IMPROVEMENT. WE'VE HEARD

02:25:17.241 --> 02:25:19.077
REPORTS OF YOU KNOW LIKE. YOU

02:25:19.143 --> 02:25:20.044
KNOW FIVE HUNDRED BUCKS A

02:25:20.111 --> 02:25:20.978
THOUSAND BUCKS RIGHT SO.

02:25:21.045 --> 02:25:22.980
OBVIOUSLY THE SCOPE OF. THE

02:25:23.047 --> 02:25:24.715
PARTICULARIZED AUDIT UNDER OUR

02:25:24.782 --> 02:25:27.085
BILL. WOULD DEPEND ON THE SCOPE

02:25:27.151 --> 02:25:28.920
OF WHAT YOU'RE PROPOSING. BUT I

02:25:28.986 --> 02:25:29.954
GUESS I'D SAY YOU KNOW IF IT

02:25:30.021 --> 02:25:31.089
SAVES FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS

02:25:31.155 --> 02:25:32.323
RIGHT. WHICH IS THE AVERAGE

02:25:32.390 --> 02:25:33.958
COST OF A HOME ENERGY AUDIT.

02:25:34.025 --> 02:25:36.561
BUT IT'S FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS

02:25:36.627 --> 02:25:37.128
FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND

02:25:37.195 --> 02:25:37.762
DOLLARS IN IMPROVEMENTS I WOULD

02:25:37.829 --> 02:25:39.297
STILL ARGUE THAT THAT. IS AN

02:25:39.363 --> 02:25:40.832
APPROPRIATE UPFRONT INVESTMENT

02:25:40.898 --> 02:25:41.999
PARTICULARLY GIVEN THAT WHEN

02:25:42.066 --> 02:25:43.134
YOU ADVERTISE THAT INTO THE

02:25:43.201 --> 02:25:44.969
PACE FINANCING STRUCTURE. IT'S

02:25:45.036 --> 02:25:46.070
GONNA BE A SMALL SMALL FRACTION

02:25:46.137 --> 02:25:47.538
OF THAT RIGHT. FOUR HUNDRED

02:25:47.605 --> 02:25:49.307
DOLLARS AS A MEANING FULL CHECK

02:25:49.373 --> 02:25:51.375
AGAINST FRAUD AND A HUNDRED

02:25:51.442 --> 02:25:52.376
FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLAR HUNDRED

THOUSAND OR WHATEVER. ALL HOME

02:25:53.678 --> 02:25:55.346
IMPROVEMENT. I THINK IS A

02:25:55.413 --> 02:25:57.281
WORTHWHILE INVESTMENT. GIVEN

02:25:57.348 --> 02:25:58.783
THE SCALE OF FRAUD WE'VE SEEN

02:25:58.850 --> 02:26:00.384
WITH THIS PARTICULAR PROGRAM.

02:26:00.451 --> 02:26:01.652

FARTHER WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.

02:26:04.155 --> 02:26:05.790
AREAS IN OUR COMMUNITIES.

02:26:05.857 --> 02:26:07.692

SHORT I THINK IT'S A NOBLE.

02:26:12.263 --> 02:26:13.431
AREA BUT I THINK THERE'S A LOT

02:26:13.498 --> 02:26:15.133
OF QUESTIONS STILL AS FAR AS

02:26:15.199 --> 02:26:15.800
THAT AND HOW IT'S GONNA

02:26:15.867 --> 02:26:17.835
ACTUALLY BURDEN. ALONE ARE

ABOUT TWELVE YEARS AGO ACTUALLY

02:26:38.956 --> 02:26:40.925
MAYBE A LITTLE BIT MORE NAP.

02:26:40.992 --> 02:26:43.995
THE PACE PROGRAM MADE A PITCH

02:26:44.061 --> 02:26:48.666

02:26:55.907 --> 02:26:59.911
WEST SO LOOKING AT CURRENT LAW

02:26:59.977 --> 02:27:02.513
THAT HAS BEEN PASSED- IT'S

02:27:02.580 --> 02:27:03.915
CLEANED UP A LOT OF THE WILD

02:27:03.981 --> 02:27:07.952
WEST I BELIEVE YOUR BILL IS THE

02:27:08.019 --> 02:27:10.154
LAST PIECE OF THE PUZZLE. TO

02:27:10.221 --> 02:27:13.991
MAKE THIS EQUITABLE- WHAT I

02:27:14.058 --> 02:27:17.094
FIND CURIOUS AND ODD IT MAY BE

02:27:17.161 --> 02:27:20.598
A BILL FOR ANY OF US TO SUPPORT

02:27:20.665 --> 02:27:25.903
THE FUTURE. IS WHY DOES THE-

02:27:25.970 --> 02:27:29.540
ASSESSMENT THE AUDIT HAVE TO BE

02:27:29.607 --> 02:27:31.842
PAID CASH UP FRONT WHY NOT

02:27:31.909 --> 02:27:34.812
AMORTIZE IT WITH THE PACE

02:27:34.879 --> 02:27:37.515
PROGRAM FINANCING. THAT WILL

02:27:37.582 --> 02:27:39.984
BASICALLY TAKE MOST OF THIS

02:27:40.051 --> 02:27:44.188
ISSUE ALTHOUGH THE COURT- YEAH

02:27:44.255 --> 02:27:49.460
IT'S SO. THE OTHER THING. IS TO

02:27:49.527 --> 02:27:50.995
THIS DAY THROUGH MY

02:27:51.062 --> 02:27:53.664
NEIGHBORHOOD THE PACE PEOPLE

02:27:53.731 --> 02:27:56.167
STILL COME THROUGH DORMITORY

02:27:56.234 --> 02:27:58.236
FOR THREE WEEKS I DON'T KNOW IF

02:27:58.302 --> 02:28:00.471
I'M UNDER LIST OR WHAT BUT I

02:28:00.538 --> 02:28:04.242
DID MY OWN ASSESSMENT I MADE

02:28:04.308 --> 02:28:05.643
SEVENTY. SO MOST OF THE PACE

02:28:05.710 --> 02:28:08.212
PROGRAM FINANCING IS TWENTY

02:28:08.279 --> 02:28:09.580
FIVE TO THIRTY YEARS MY

02:28:09.647 --> 02:28:11.916
LIFESPAN EXPECTANCY IN GOOD

02:28:11.983 --> 02:28:16.320
HEALTH IS TO AGE. EIGHTY SEVEN-

02:28:16.387 --> 02:28:18.289
I'M A LITTLE SHORT THERE. BUT

02:28:18.356 --> 02:28:21.092
THEY'RE STILL PETTINESS SO I

02:28:21.158 --> 02:28:23.728
BELIEVE THAT THIS ASSESSMENT

02:28:23.794 --> 02:28:26.197
THIS AUDIT WOULD BE GREAT

02:28:26.264 --> 02:28:28.299
ESPECIALLY FOR SENIOR CITIZENS

02:28:28.366 --> 02:28:30.167
THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU

02:28:30.234 --> 02:28:31.836
VERY MUCH THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF

02:28:31.902 --> 02:28:34.338
QUESTIONS FOR YOU SENATOR MAN-

02:28:34.405 --> 02:28:35.873
BEFORE I MOVE ON AND WANT TO

02:28:35.940 --> 02:28:37.675
KNOW IF ANY OF THE OPPOSITION

02:28:37.742 --> 02:28:40.544
WANTS TO REPLY TO. THAT I THINK

02:28:40.611 --> 02:28:43.648
WE HAVE A COUPLE PEOPLE ON

02:28:43.714 --> 02:28:44.248
THERE BEFORE THE SAID TO STAY

02:28:44.315 --> 02:28:55.760
ON THE LINE. REGISTER OKAY-

02:28:55.826 --> 02:28:58.829
THIS IS THE OTHER QUESTIONS. SO

02:28:58.896 --> 02:29:00.564
I HAVE PO GOING I'M SORRY

02:29:00.631 --> 02:29:02.800
SOMEONE MORE THAT MAKE YOUR

02:29:02.867 --> 02:29:04.769
COMMENTS- IF THAT'S ACCEPTABLE

02:29:04.835 --> 02:29:08.873
THEN. FOR ME I HAVE COMMENTS

02:29:08.939 --> 02:29:14.578
ONE ONE QUESTIONS- I THINK-

02:29:14.645 --> 02:29:15.813
THAT MY COLLEAGUE FROM THE

02:29:15.880 --> 02:29:18.249
SEVENTY FIRST- MAKES A GOOD

02:29:18.316 --> 02:29:23.521
POINT ABOUT- HOW THE- AUDIT

02:29:23.587 --> 02:29:24.922
WILL GET PAID I THINK THE FACT

02:29:24.989 --> 02:29:26.924
OF THE MATTER IS- THAT ISSUE IS

02:29:26.991 --> 02:29:29.160
NOT GOING TO BE RESOLVED. UNTIL

02:29:29.226 --> 02:29:31.329
AN AUDIT IS REQUIRED ONCE THE

02:29:31.395 --> 02:29:32.596
AUDIT IS REQUIRED THEN PEOPLE

02:29:32.663 --> 02:29:34.332
ARE GONNA START TO FIGURE OUT

02:29:34.398 --> 02:29:35.866
HOW TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN SO THE

02:29:35.933 --> 02:29:38.836
REAL QUESTION HERE IS- IS THIS

02:29:38.903 --> 02:29:39.770
MEANINGFUL ENOUGH IS THIS

02:29:39.837 --> 02:29:41.972
IMPORTANT ENOUGH. FOR US TO

02:29:42.039 --> 02:29:44.041
REQUIRE AN AUDIT AND I WOULD

02:29:44.108 --> 02:29:46.043
ENCOURAGE THE AUTHOR TO

02:29:46.110 --> 02:29:48.279
CONTINUE TO TALK TO OPPOSITION

02:29:48.346 --> 02:29:50.581
ABOUT OTHER OPTIONS THAT- THAT

02:29:50.648 --> 02:29:54.285
MIGHT BE OUT THERE- OTHER MAY

02:29:54.352 --> 02:29:56.387
IN FACT BE. SOMETHING A LITTLE

02:29:56.454 --> 02:29:57.488
LESS SEVERE THAN THE AUDIT

02:29:57.555 --> 02:29:59.924
THAT- IS ENVISIONED IT AT AT

02:29:59.990 --> 02:30:04.228
THIS POINT. I'M I THINK IT'S

02:30:04.295 --> 02:30:07.131
LOOKED VERY VERY LEGITIMATE TO-

02:30:07.198 --> 02:30:09.734
BE CONCERNED ABOUT THE IMPACT

02:30:09.800 --> 02:30:11.402
OF THE COST OF THE AUDIT ON OUR

02:30:11.469 --> 02:30:13.404
LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES THE

02:30:13.471 --> 02:30:15.473
QUESTION FOR ME IS THAT

02:30:15.539 --> 02:30:19.210
OUTWEIGHED BY THE FRAUD THAT IS

02:30:19.276 --> 02:30:21.011
BEING VISITED UPON OUR LOW

02:30:21.078 --> 02:30:22.480
INCOME OR VULNERABLE

02:30:22.546 --> 02:30:24.448
COMMUNITIES BECAUSE TO THE

02:30:24.515 --> 02:30:26.684
EXTENT THIS CALL CONSUMER FRAUD

02:30:26.751 --> 02:30:29.253
IS HAPPENING IT IS TYPICALLY

02:30:29.320 --> 02:30:32.790
GOING TO BE- VISITED UPON THOSE

02:30:32.857 --> 02:30:35.159
WHO ARE- UNAWARE WHO HAVE

02:30:35.226 --> 02:30:37.128
DIFFICULTY UNDERSTANDING WHAT'S

02:30:37.194 --> 02:30:42.199
BEING PATCHED- AND- YOU KNOW

02:30:42.266 --> 02:30:43.467
FOR ME IT'S CLEAR OF CRITICAL

02:30:43.534 --> 02:30:45.836
IMPORTANCE AND SO THE DECIDING

02:30:45.903 --> 02:30:49.173
FACTOR TO ME ON THIS- BILL WAS

02:30:49.240 --> 02:30:52.410
LISTENING TO THE ATTORNEYS FROM

02:30:52.476 --> 02:30:54.945
THAT STATIC. AND FROM IRVINE I

02:30:55.012 --> 02:30:57.548
FORGET THE NAME OF THE- OF THE

02:30:57.615 --> 02:31:00.151
ORGANIZATION AND THE

02:31:00.217 --> 02:31:03.120
TESTIMONIALS THAT THEY PRESENT-

02:31:03.187 --> 02:31:05.222
WHICH ARE OUTRAGEOUS I MEAN

02:31:05.289 --> 02:31:08.025
TRULY OUTRAGEOUS EXAMPLES OF

02:31:08.092 --> 02:31:11.395
CONSUMER FRAUD- SO I THINK THIS

02:31:11.462 --> 02:31:14.432
IS- A PROPOSAL IN THE IN THE

02:31:14.498 --> 02:31:19.470
BILL IS IMPORTANT AND. TO I

02:31:19.537 --> 02:31:20.037
THINK WE OUGHT TO BE MOVING

02:31:20.104 --> 02:31:21.205
FORWARD. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY

02:31:21.272 --> 02:31:22.139
MEMBER ANYONE ELSE FOR

02:31:22.206 --> 02:31:24.041
QUESTIONS. SO I HAVE A FEW

02:31:24.108 --> 02:31:27.378
QUESTIONS. SO I WAS THINKING

02:31:27.445 --> 02:31:29.246
SENATOR SO WHAT HAPPENS IF THE

02:31:29.313 --> 02:31:32.483
HOMEOWNER PAYS FOR THE AUDIT

02:31:32.550 --> 02:31:34.785
INTERVIEW AUDIT AND THEY DECIDE

02:31:34.852 --> 02:31:37.121
NOT TO PROCEED WITH THE PROJECT-

02:31:37.188 --> 02:31:39.190
IF THE HOME OUR WORK WILL HELP

02:31:39.256 --> 02:31:40.057
IF THE HOMEOWNER WOULD PAY FOR

02:31:40.124 --> 02:31:41.992
THE AUDIT. WHICH IS AN F.

02:31:42.059 --> 02:31:43.694
BECAUSE WE I WANT TO CLARIFY

02:31:43.761 --> 02:31:45.930
AGAIN WE LEAVE THIS OPEN AND WE

02:31:45.996 --> 02:31:47.131
BELIEVE IS ASSEMBLY MEMBER

02:31:47.198 --> 02:31:48.399
BLOOM SAID THAT THERE ARE OTHER

02:31:48.466 --> 02:31:50.134
THINGS WILL RISE BUT WE ALSO

02:31:50.201 --> 02:31:51.168
THINK IT WOULD MAKE FINANCIAL

02:31:51.235 --> 02:31:52.937
SENSE FOR CONTRACTORS TO BEAR

02:31:53.003 --> 02:31:54.572
THE UPFRONT COSTS AGAIN IF IT'S

02:31:54.638 --> 02:31:57.208
A LOW ENOUGH. THRESHOLD AND IT

02:31:57.274 --> 02:31:58.242
YOU KNOW THERE TO SAY IT'S

02:31:58.309 --> 02:31:59.410
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OR

02:31:59.477 --> 02:32:00.678
THOUSANDS OR TENS OF THOUSANDS

02:32:00.744 --> 02:32:02.680
OF DOLLARS AND IMPROVEMENTS IF

02:32:02.746 --> 02:32:03.280
IT'S A WORTHWHILE PERCENT OF

02:32:03.347 --> 02:32:05.483
PROJECTS. I THINK AN HONEST

02:32:05.549 --> 02:32:06.851
CONTRACTOR TO I'LL PITCH YOU

02:32:06.917 --> 02:32:08.252
THE HUNDRED BUCKS OR WHATEVER

02:32:08.319 --> 02:32:09.286
IT IS FIFTY BUCKS WHATEVER THE

02:32:09.353 --> 02:32:10.988
COST IS UP FRONT KNOWING THAT

02:32:11.055 --> 02:32:12.223
IT CAN ROLL GET ROLLED UP AND I

02:32:12.289 --> 02:32:14.091
JUST WANNA CLARIFY I HAVE BEEN

02:32:14.158 --> 02:32:15.292
TOLD BY LET'S COUNCIL. THAT

02:32:15.359 --> 02:32:17.661
THIS THAT THE UP AUDIT CAN BE

02:32:17.728 --> 02:32:18.996
ROLLED IN THE PACE MANSINGH IS

02:32:19.063 --> 02:32:20.331
NOT AUTOMATICALLY DONE BECAUSE

02:32:20.397 --> 02:32:21.966
THERE IS THE BINARY DECISION

02:32:22.032 --> 02:32:23.400
YES NO IF THE HOMEOWNER

02:32:23.467 --> 02:32:25.402
ACTUALLY ONCE YOU SPACE. IF THE

02:32:25.469 --> 02:32:27.271
HOMEOWNER DECIDES NOT TO SPACE

02:32:27.338 --> 02:32:28.472
THEN THE COST OF THAT AUDIT

02:32:28.539 --> 02:32:30.107
WHOEVER BEARS IT IS EATEN BY

02:32:30.174 --> 02:32:31.709
THE WHOEVER PAID FOR WHETHER

02:32:31.775 --> 02:32:32.309
THAT'S A CONTRACTOR THE

02:32:32.376 --> 02:32:36.747
HOMEOWNER. OBVIOUSLY YOU CAN'T

02:32:36.814 --> 02:32:37.381
GET RULED IN THE CASE. OKAY SO

02:32:37.448 --> 02:32:38.549
I'M- SO THERE ANYTHING THE BILL

02:32:38.616 --> 02:32:40.351
WHICH FOR PRETTY. THE HOMEOWNER

02:32:40.417 --> 02:32:41.619
FOR- IN THE INSTANCE FOR AN

02:32:41.685 --> 02:32:42.720
ENERGY AUDIT POINTS OUT

02:32:42.786 --> 02:32:44.889
INEFFICIENCIES. IN THEIR HOMES

02:32:44.955 --> 02:32:47.358
HAVING NOTHING TO DO WITH THE

02:32:47.424 --> 02:32:47.925
REASON THEY'RE INVESTIGATING

02:32:47.992 --> 02:32:49.360
THE PROGRAM. I'M SORRY I DIDN'T

02:32:49.426 --> 02:32:51.128
HEAR THE QUESTION FULLY IS

02:32:51.195 --> 02:32:52.129
THERE ANYTHING IN YOUR BILL

02:32:52.196 --> 02:32:54.231
THE- WHICH WOULD PROTECT A

02:32:54.298 --> 02:32:55.933
HOMEOWNER IN THE INSTANCE WHERE

02:32:56.000 --> 02:32:57.468
AN ENERGY AUDIT POINTS OUT IN A

02:32:57.535 --> 02:32:59.169
FINISH INEFFICIENCIES IN THEIR

02:32:59.236 --> 02:33:01.405
HOME. HAVING NOTHING TO DO WITH

02:33:01.472 --> 02:33:02.039
THE REASON THEY'RE

02:33:02.106 --> 02:33:03.741
INVESTIGATING THE PROGRAM SO IF

02:33:03.807 --> 02:33:05.075
IT I GUESS THE QUESTION IS IF

02:33:05.142 --> 02:33:06.510
AN ENERGY AUDITOR WOULD TO

02:33:06.577 --> 02:33:08.445
FRAUDULENTLY POINT OUT. THINGS

02:33:08.512 --> 02:33:11.315
THAT WERE. NOT THERE LIKELY

02:33:11.382 --> 02:33:12.850
THEY WERE TO SAY YOU HAVE LIKE

02:33:12.917 --> 02:33:15.719
A GAS LEAK OR IN ENERGY

02:33:15.786 --> 02:33:18.088
EFFICIENT WINDOWS- OFFERED TO

02:33:18.155 --> 02:33:19.823
MAYBE- STACY TALK HERE BUT I

02:33:19.890 --> 02:33:21.392
WAS IN THAT BE FRAUD- AND

02:33:21.458 --> 02:33:22.693
PROTECTED BY. EXISTING

02:33:22.760 --> 02:33:24.628
CONTRACTUAL CRIMINAL FRAUD LOSS

02:33:24.695 --> 02:33:26.764
BUT- MISS CUT FROM YOU SEE I

02:33:26.830 --> 02:33:29.233
CONSUMER LAW CLINIC MIGHT BE IN

02:33:29.300 --> 02:33:29.800
A BETTER POSITION TO ANSWER

02:33:29.867 --> 02:33:34.071
THAT QUESTION. YES AND YOU KNOW

02:33:34.138 --> 02:33:35.906
IT. MY UNDERSTANDING IS THE

02:33:35.973 --> 02:33:37.975
SAME AS SENATOR MAN THAT WOULD

02:33:38.042 --> 02:33:39.543
BE MY RESPONSE IT IS THAT YOU

02:33:39.610 --> 02:33:40.878
KNOW IF THERE IS FRAUD THAT'S

02:33:40.945 --> 02:33:43.714
COMMITTED UNDER THE ENERGY

02:33:43.781 --> 02:33:45.049
AUDIT WORK FRAUDULENTLY

02:33:45.115 --> 02:33:46.550
RECOMMENDED AND I BELIEVE THAT

02:33:46.617 --> 02:33:47.985
THERE WOULD BE RECOURSE FOR THE

02:33:48.052 --> 02:33:49.286
HOMEOWNER IN THOSE.

02:33:49.353 --> 02:33:52.022
CIRCUMSTANCES THOUGH I HAVE TO

02:33:52.089 --> 02:33:52.990
BUT I CAN SOMEONE INTERPRET

02:33:53.057 --> 02:33:54.091
YOUR QUESTION A LITTLE BIT

02:33:54.158 --> 02:33:56.293
DIFFERENTLY WHICH IS S. B. AT

02:33:56.360 --> 02:33:59.029
ENERGY AUDIT- LOCATED AB OTHER

02:33:59.096 --> 02:34:00.664
IMPROVEMENTS THAT COULD BE MADE

02:34:00.731 --> 02:34:02.833
OR MORE COST EFFECTIVELY MADE-

02:34:02.900 --> 02:34:04.501
WHETHER OR NOT DEAD THAT THE

02:34:04.568 --> 02:34:05.803
HOMEOWNER WOULD BE ABLE TO MOVE

02:34:05.869 --> 02:34:06.870
FORWARD WITH THOSE. OR MOVE

02:34:06.937 --> 02:34:08.539
FORWARD WITH THE CASE FINANCING

02:34:08.606 --> 02:34:09.707
AND M. AND IT WOULD BE MY

02:34:09.773 --> 02:34:10.908
UNDERSTANDING ON THE WAY THAT

02:34:10.975 --> 02:34:12.343
THE BILL AS CURRENTLY WRITTEN.

02:34:12.409 --> 02:34:14.178
THE ENERGY AUDIT AND COVERS

02:34:14.244 --> 02:34:15.346
OTHER IMPROVEMENTS THAT CAN BE

02:34:15.412 --> 02:34:17.548
DONE AS LONG AS THEY ALIGNED

02:34:17.615 --> 02:34:19.516
WITH THE GOALS OF THE PEACE-

02:34:19.583 --> 02:34:21.418
PROGRAM AND THE APPROVED. ANY

02:34:21.485 --> 02:34:22.886
IMPROVEMENTS THAT ARE ALLOWED

02:34:22.953 --> 02:34:24.021
WITHIN THAT WHICH I WOULD

02:34:24.088 --> 02:34:25.489
IMAGINE THEY ALL WOULD UNDER

02:34:25.556 --> 02:34:27.124
THAT SCENARIO. THEN THE

02:34:27.191 --> 02:34:28.459
FINANCING COULD BE USED FOR

02:34:28.525 --> 02:34:30.194
OTHER IDENTIFIED PROJECTS WITH

02:34:30.260 --> 02:34:33.397
IN- THAT AUDIT- AND TO ALLOW

02:34:33.464 --> 02:34:34.832
THE HOMEOWNER THAN TO PICK AND

02:34:34.898 --> 02:34:36.967
CHOOSE WHAT IS MOST IMPORTANT

02:34:37.034 --> 02:34:39.169
AND MOST COST EFFECTIVE. FOR

MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT IN AN

FRAUD PRINCIPLES IT DOESN'T SAY

02:36:06.990 --> 02:36:08.225
THAT THE BILL BUTTHAT OF

COURSE WOULD BE MY

02:36:09.226 --> 02:36:10.561
UNDERSTANDING OF HOW OUR BILL

02:36:10.627 --> 02:36:11.695

LAW AS FAR AS MISS PUTS THIS

02:36:13.731 --> 02:36:15.599
MONEY I BELIEVE THAT YOU KNOW

02:36:15.666 --> 02:36:16.867
IF AN ENERGY AUDIT SHOWS

02:36:16.934 --> 02:36:18.902
ADDITIONAL PROJECTS IN THE

02:36:18.969 --> 02:36:19.737

TAKE THEM UP I BELIEVE THE BILL

02:36:22.172 --> 02:36:23.674
WOULD GIVE LICENSE TO DO

02:36:23.741 --> 02:36:24.742
ANYTHING APPROPRIATE RIGHT-

02:36:24.808 --> 02:36:27.044
OPPOSITE THE AUDIT ITSELF WOULD

02:36:27.111 --> 02:36:27.878
COVER THE PROPOSED

02:36:27.945 --> 02:36:29.446
IMPROVEMENTS. SO IF FOR EXAMPLE

02:36:29.513 --> 02:36:31.215
UNDER HER SCENARIO AND ENERGY

02:36:31.281 --> 02:36:34.251

THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO LOOK AT THE

02:36:35.385 --> 02:36:36.954
WINDOWS BUT THEY ALSO LOOK AT

02:36:37.020 --> 02:36:38.489
YOU KNOW MAYBE THE DOORS AND

02:36:38.555 --> 02:36:40.758
THE DRAFTY DOORS- AND INCLUDE

02:36:40.824 --> 02:36:42.593
AN ENERGY AUDIT WELL THAT NOW

IS COVERED AS PART OF THE AUDIT

02:36:43.894 --> 02:36:45.429

HOMEOWNER AND CONTRACTOR

02:36:48.699 --> 02:36:50.934
DECIDED P. PROCEED WITH PACE- I

02:36:51.001 --> 02:36:52.669
WOULD ASSUME THAT OULD WORK-

02:36:52.736 --> 02:36:54.037
IT DOESN'T SAY THAT IN THE BILL

02:36:54.104 --> 02:36:54.938
BUT I SEEM JUST THE WAY THE

02:36:55.005 --> 02:37:01.044
BILL WORKS. WITH EXISTING LAW

02:37:01.111 --> 02:37:01.945
THAT WOULD BE COVERED. REMINDS

02:37:02.012 --> 02:37:03.680
IS GIVEN OPPORTUNITY FOR UPS.

02:37:03.747 --> 02:37:05.249
I'M SORRY WHAT AND- JUDY FOR UP

02:37:05.315 --> 02:37:06.650
SELLING SO. THAT'S REFERENCE.

02:37:06.717 --> 02:37:07.618
IS RIGHT NOW IS BECAUSE A LOT

02:37:07.684 --> 02:37:11.054
OF. YOU HAVE SOME. AND I'M A

02:37:11.121 --> 02:37:12.523
THERE'S A LOT HERE THAT NEEDS

02:37:12.589 --> 02:37:13.590
TO BE TAKEN CARE OF I MEAN WE

02:37:13.657 --> 02:37:15.726
CAN'T ASSUME WHEN WE'RE MAKING

02:37:15.793 --> 02:37:17.427
THE BILL. WE HAVE TO BE PRETTY

02:37:17.494 --> 02:37:19.329
CUT AND DRY AS WE DO THESE AND

02:37:19.396 --> 02:37:21.165
YES WE CAN DO A FOUNDATION AND

02:37:21.231 --> 02:37:23.634
ADD TO IT. SO I'M- NOT

02:37:23.700 --> 02:37:25.969
CONCERNED ABOUT THAT PORTION OF

02:37:26.036 --> 02:37:30.541
IT- OKAY I THINK THAT'S MY

02:37:30.607 --> 02:37:32.209
QUESTION FOR RIGHT NOW YES

02:37:32.276 --> 02:37:37.080
ASSEMBLY MEMBER. OF I'D I'D I'D

02:37:37.147 --> 02:37:38.048
THINK THERE MAY BE SOME

02:37:38.115 --> 02:37:40.050
MISUNDERSTANDING HERE- MY

02:37:40.117 --> 02:37:41.318
UNDERSTANDING OF THE AUDITOR'S

02:37:41.385 --> 02:37:42.619
RESPONSIBILITY IS THAT IT'S

02:37:42.686 --> 02:37:45.756
INDEPENDENT FROM- THOSE WHO

02:37:45.823 --> 02:37:48.625
WOULD PERFORM THE WORK. SO

02:37:48.692 --> 02:37:50.894
THERE WOULD BE NO MOTIVATION A

02:37:50.961 --> 02:37:51.995
MINUTE MAYBE I CAN ASK THIS

02:37:52.062 --> 02:37:54.898
QUESTION WOULD THERE BE. ANY

02:37:54.965 --> 02:37:56.266
MOTIVATION ON THE PART OF THE

02:37:56.333 --> 02:37:59.269
AUDITOR TO DO UP SELLING OF ANY

02:37:59.336 --> 02:38:01.271
SORT THE AUDITORS GOING TO GET

02:38:01.338 --> 02:38:02.606
PAID WHAT THE AUDITOR IS GOING

02:38:02.673 --> 02:38:04.308
TO GET PAID FOR PROVIDING A

02:38:04.374 --> 02:38:06.243
REPORT AND THAT'S IT. YEAH THAT

02:38:06.310 --> 02:38:07.511
WOULD BE THE WAY THAT THIS BILL

02:38:07.578 --> 02:38:08.979
IS WRITTEN IN THE AUDITOR IS

02:38:09.046 --> 02:38:11.248
INDEPENDENT AND IF YOU PAY THEM

02:38:11.315 --> 02:38:12.216
A HUNDRED DOLLARS TO DO A VERY

02:38:12.282 --> 02:38:13.884
LIMITED AUDIT I DON'T THINK

02:38:13.951 --> 02:38:15.252
THEY WOULD HAVE AN INCENTIVE TO

02:38:15.319 --> 02:38:16.587
DO MORE THAN THE SCOPE OF THAT

02:38:16.653 --> 02:38:19.223
AUDIT- SO I DO THINK AND THEN

02:38:19.289 --> 02:38:20.190
ON TOP OF THAT ADDRESS YOUR

02:38:20.257 --> 02:38:22.259
CONCERNS CHAIR AGUIAR-CURRY. I

02:38:22.326 --> 02:38:23.760
DO THINK ALSO JUST HAVING THAT

02:38:23.827 --> 02:38:25.529
INFORMATION FROM A THIRD PARTY

02:38:25.596 --> 02:38:27.231
AS TO THE APPROPRIATENESS OF

02:38:27.297 --> 02:38:28.498
THIS THE COST SAVINGS THE

02:38:28.565 --> 02:38:30.734
POTENTIAL COSTS. THAT WILL BE

02:38:30.801 --> 02:38:32.703
SOMETHING THAT REGARDLESS OF

02:38:32.769 --> 02:38:33.804
YOU KNOW WHETHER THERE'S A IN

02:38:33.871 --> 02:38:35.505
ITS SENATE BY ANYONE TO UP SELL

02:38:35.572 --> 02:38:36.506
THAT'S INFORMATION YOU'RE

02:38:36.573 --> 02:38:37.708
ARMING THE CONSUMER WITH THAT I

02:38:37.774 --> 02:38:39.042
THINK WOULD BE HELPFUL IN

02:38:39.109 --> 02:38:41.378
DETERRING AND PREVENTING AGAIN

02:38:41.445 --> 02:38:43.213
THESE AGREE JUST TYPES OF FRAUD

02:38:43.280 --> 02:38:44.648
WE'RE SEEING ACROSS THE COUNTRY

02:38:44.715 --> 02:38:45.949
IN THE STATE. THAT ARE

02:38:46.016 --> 02:38:47.851
IMPACTING- TO THE ASSEMBLY

02:38:47.918 --> 02:38:49.486
MEMBER BLOOMS POINTS OUT

02:38:49.553 --> 02:38:50.754
COMMUNITIES OF COLOR

02:38:50.821 --> 02:38:51.955
COMMUNITIES THAT DON'T SPEAK

02:38:52.022 --> 02:38:53.957
ENGLISH VERY WELL IT REALLY IS

02:38:54.024 --> 02:38:56.026
TARGETING THE ELDERLY OUR MOST

02:38:56.093 --> 02:38:58.028
VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES AND- I

02:38:58.095 --> 02:38:59.596
YOU KNOW THAT FOR ME THIS IS A

02:38:59.663 --> 02:39:01.665
RIGHTEOUS BILL IT'S A BILL THAT

02:39:01.732 --> 02:39:02.699
CAN HELP IN A MEANINGFUL WAY

02:39:02.766 --> 02:39:04.534
AND- I APPRECIATED SOMEONE

02:39:04.601 --> 02:39:10.274
MEMORABLE POST COMMENTS AND I.

02:39:10.340 --> 02:39:10.841
DO HOPE YOU MAKE IT ANOTHER

02:39:10.908 --> 02:39:12.943
THIRTY YEAR SIR. I IF I. IF I.

02:39:13.010 --> 02:39:14.611
JUST I WOULD BE CONCERNED IF

02:39:14.678 --> 02:39:16.947
THE CHAIRS- COMMENTS ARE ARE

02:39:17.014 --> 02:39:18.949
ARE CORRECT- IF THERE WERE THE

02:39:19.016 --> 02:39:20.817
OPPORTUNITY FOR THE AUDITOR TO

02:39:20.884 --> 02:39:24.388
SOMEHOW- INFLUENCE. WHAT THE-

02:39:24.454 --> 02:39:27.324
OF. THE DEPTH OF. THE PROJECT

02:39:27.391 --> 02:39:29.726
IN ANY WAY- I'D BE CONCERNED

02:39:29.793 --> 02:39:31.395
ABOUT THAT SO IF THE BILL WERE

02:39:31.461 --> 02:39:32.162
TO MOVE FORWARD MAYBE THERE'S A

02:39:32.229 --> 02:39:33.830
WAY TO TIGHTEN UP THE LANGUAGE

02:39:33.897 --> 02:39:34.498
TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT THAT'S NOT

02:39:34.564 --> 02:39:36.333
THE CASE. I APPRECIATE THAT

02:39:36.400 --> 02:39:37.634
COMMENT AND I DO WANT TO SAY

02:39:37.701 --> 02:39:38.735
THAT IF THIS BILL DOES MOVE

02:39:38.802 --> 02:39:40.037
FORWARD AT A COMMITTEE I AM

02:39:40.103 --> 02:39:41.505
COMMITTED TO CONTINUING TO WORK

02:39:41.571 --> 02:39:43.140
WITH. ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS HERE

02:39:43.206 --> 02:39:44.441
INCLUDING OPPOSITION TO TRY TO

02:39:44.508 --> 02:39:45.976
MAKE THIS BILL BETTER- THE

02:39:46.043 --> 02:39:48.512
GOALS HERE ARE AGAIN TO CREATE

02:39:48.578 --> 02:39:50.280
A MEANINGFUL CHECK ON FRAUD. I

02:39:50.347 --> 02:39:51.615
WITH AN INDEPENDENT AUDITOR TO

02:39:51.682 --> 02:39:52.549
HAPPY TO MAKE THAT LANGUAGE

02:39:52.616 --> 02:39:53.483
CLEAR THAT IT MUST BE

02:39:53.550 --> 02:39:55.285
INDEPENDENT- I DO BELIEVE THAT

02:39:55.352 --> 02:39:56.987
IS ALREADY IN THE BILL BUT I

02:39:57.054 --> 02:39:57.888
WILL TAKE ANOTHER LOOK WILL TRY

02:39:57.955 --> 02:39:59.890
TO CLARIFY. AND ALLUSIVE DATE

02:39:59.957 --> 02:40:01.525
THAT MORE- TO SOME OF THE OTHER

02:40:01.591 --> 02:40:02.559
CONCERNS RAISED AROUND

02:40:02.626 --> 02:40:04.294
UPSELLING- WE WILL TRY TO

02:40:04.361 --> 02:40:05.896
ADDRESS THOSE- IF THIS BILL

02:40:05.963 --> 02:40:07.197
MOVES AT A COMMITTEE BUT BUT WE%

02:40:07.264 --> 02:40:10.734
ARE COMMITTED. TO MAKING A GOOD

02:40:10.801 --> 02:40:11.301
POLICY BILL HERE. SO IF YOU

02:40:11.368 --> 02:40:14.838
WANT. THE H. BACK. AND LOOK AT

02:40:14.905 --> 02:40:16.974
THE CONTRACTOR AND THE OTHER

02:40:17.040 --> 02:40:20.777
SAYS YOU NEED A NEW ROOF- THE

02:40:20.844 --> 02:40:23.447
CONTRACTORS HELP SELL FILLING

UP SELLING YOU ON BOTH RIGHT.

02:40:25.515 --> 02:40:26.683
WELL I THINK THE WAY THIS BILL

02:40:26.750 --> 02:40:27.951
OPERATES THE AUDIT WOULD BE

02:40:28.018 --> 02:40:29.920
HAVE TO COVER THE ROOF FOR THE

02:40:29.987 --> 02:40:30.854
CONTRACTOR TO BE ABLE TO DO IT

02:40:30.921 --> 02:40:32.456
SO THAT THE CONTRACTOR CAME TO

02:40:32.522 --> 02:40:34.424
YOU AND SAID I HAVE AN H. BACK

02:40:34.491 --> 02:40:35.325
IMPROVEMENT RIGHT NOW THEY ARE

02:40:35.392 --> 02:40:36.693
DOING THAT. WOULD SEND YOU THAT

02:40:36.760 --> 02:40:37.761
LIVE NATION I CAN COME IN FOR

02:40:37.828 --> 02:40:39.329
YOU AND- BY THE WAY A ROOF CAN

02:40:39.396 --> 02:40:41.365
HELP TO AND- IT'S GONNA COST

02:40:41.431 --> 02:40:42.265
YOU ANYTHING IS GOVERNMENT

02:40:42.332 --> 02:40:44.101
FINANCE AND THEN YOU END UP

02:40:44.167 --> 02:40:45.302
WITH FIFTY THOUSAND A HUNDRED

02:40:45.369 --> 02:40:45.836
THOUSAND DOLLARS AND HOME

02:40:45.902 --> 02:40:47.404
IMPROVEMENTS THAT GO TO SUPER

02:40:47.471 --> 02:40:49.072
PRIORITY LIEN. I WITH THIS

02:40:49.139 --> 02:40:50.574
AUDIT REQUIREMENT DO WOULD SAY

02:40:50.640 --> 02:40:52.109
THAT IF THE CONTRACTOR NEEDS TO

02:40:52.175 --> 02:40:53.243
GET AN INDEPENDENT AUDIT FOR

02:40:53.310 --> 02:40:55.078
ALL THE SCOPE OF PROPOSED

02:40:55.145 --> 02:40:56.580
IMPROVEMENTS SO IF THEY DON'T

02:48:20.824 --> 02:48:23.126
BE DEVELOPED. AND IT'S ON A

02:48:23.193 --> 02:48:24.160
TIERED STRUCTURE THE MORE YOU

02:48:24.227 --> 02:48:26.229
BUILD. THE MORE SANDERS WOULD

02:48:26.296 --> 02:48:28.231
BE INCLUDED. DEFENSIBLE SPACE

02:48:28.298 --> 02:48:29.766
VEGETATION MANAGEMENT OF FUEL

02:48:29.833 --> 02:48:30.934
MODIFICATION REQUIREMENTS AND

02:48:31.000 --> 02:48:32.936
ENFORCEMENT OF CURRENT PROGRAMS

02:48:33.002 --> 02:48:34.404
ESTABLISHED FUNDED AND

02:48:34.471 --> 02:48:37.073
IMPLEMENTED. VIA H. AWAY FUNDS

02:48:37.140 --> 02:48:38.908
WOULD NEED TO BE ESTABLISHED.

02:48:38.975 --> 02:48:40.310
YOU CAN NO LONGER HAVE ONE WAY

02:48:40.376 --> 02:48:42.212
IN AND ONE WAY OUT WOULD HAVE

02:48:42.278 --> 02:48:44.380
TO HAVE INGRESS AND EGRESS. AND

02:48:44.447 --> 02:48:45.448
A DEVELOPMENT LAYOUT THAT

02:48:45.515 --> 02:48:47.350
REDUCE WILDFIRE RISK TO THE

02:48:47.417 --> 02:48:49.018
GREATEST EXTENT POSSIBLE.

02:48:49.085 --> 02:48:51.154
HOWEVER THIS BILL ALSO REQUIRES

02:48:51.221 --> 02:48:52.956
A STANDARD TO BE REASONABLE AND

02:48:53.022 --> 02:48:54.491
TO BE FEASIBLE AND ACHIEVABLE

02:48:54.557 --> 02:48:56.092
FOR THE MAJORITY DEVELOPMENTS.

02:48:56.159 --> 02:48:57.727
THIS MEANS DESPITE WHAT SOME

02:48:57.794 --> 02:49:00.797
HAVE SAID COMING INTO THIS

02:49:00.864 --> 02:49:02.866
COMMITTEE. SB TWELVE. WILL NOT.

02:49:02.932 --> 02:49:04.901
SB TWELVE WILL NOT CREATE A

02:49:04.968 --> 02:49:06.836
BLANKET BAN ON NEW DEVELOPMENTS.

02:49:06.903 --> 02:49:08.037
CRUCIALLY THE STANDARDS ARE

02:49:08.104 --> 02:49:09.339
TIERED SET THE STANDARDS CAN

02:49:09.405 --> 02:49:10.673
INCREASINGLY STRONGER AS

02:49:10.740 --> 02:49:12.408
DEVELOPMENTS GET LARGER IN HIGH

02:49:12.475 --> 02:49:14.277
FIRE RISK AREAS AGAIN THIS IS

02:49:14.344 --> 02:49:16.346
ALL BUILT OFF OF COMMONSENSE.

02:49:16.412 --> 02:49:17.614
IT STRUCTURED THIS WAY BECAUSE

02:49:17.680 --> 02:49:18.848
LARGER DEVELOPMENTS PUT MORE

02:49:18.915 --> 02:49:20.383
PEOPLE INTO THE WILL BE HAVING

02:49:20.450 --> 02:49:21.918
MORE PEOPLE IN THE WILL BE

02:49:21.985 --> 02:49:22.852
MEANS THAT THERE IS MORE

02:49:22.919 --> 02:49:24.554
DANGER. THIS MEANS THAT THE

02:49:24.621 --> 02:49:26.356
REQUIREMENTS ARE STRINGENT BUT

02:49:26.422 --> 02:49:27.891
NOT SO COSTLY IS TO TOTALLY

02:49:27.957 --> 02:49:29.559
PREVENT DEVELOPMENT YOU'RE

THAT. AND INTO THIS BILL- I

03:06:01.817 --> 03:06:05.187
SUPPORTED A STRICTER- A MEASURE

03:06:05.254 --> 03:06:05.988
THAT WAS VETOED BY THE

03:06:06.054 --> 03:06:08.590

03:06:08.657 --> 03:06:10.092
YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT. OF

03:06:10.158 --> 03:06:12.961
WHERE I STAND AND- I THINK

03:06:13.028 --> 03:06:14.129
YOU'D BE HARD PRESSED TO FIND

03:06:14.196 --> 03:06:19.167
TO- A MORE VOCIFEROUS- ADVOCATE

03:06:19.234 --> 03:06:22.070
FOR- BUILDING. MARKET RATE AND

03:06:22.137 --> 03:06:23.605
AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN THE STATE

03:06:23.672 --> 03:06:27.342
OF CALIFORNIA- BUT WE DO HAVE

03:06:27.409 --> 03:06:29.511
TO BE. VERY VERY CONCERNED

03:06:29.578 --> 03:06:32.247
ABOUT PUBLIC SAFETY AT THE SAME

03:06:32.314 --> 03:06:36.184
TIME- WE HAVE- EXPERIENCE TO A

03:06:36.251 --> 03:06:38.086
WILDFIRE AFTER WILDFIRE AFTER

03:06:38.153 --> 03:06:40.522
WILDFIRE AND SEEN- THE TRAGIC

03:06:40.589 --> 03:06:41.957
CONSEQUENCES AND I DO

03:06:42.024 --> 03:06:43.992
UNDERSTAND THAT- BETTER

03:06:44.059 --> 03:06:46.528
BUILDING STANDARDS- ACHIEVE

03:06:46.595 --> 03:06:50.265
BETTER RESULTS WHEN IT COMES TO

03:06:50.332 --> 03:06:51.967
PROTECTING AGAINST A FIVE- BUT

03:06:52.034 --> 03:06:52.935
IT'S NOT JUST BUILDING

03:06:53.001 --> 03:06:54.069
STANDARDS WE HAVE TO BE

03:06:54.136 --> 03:06:55.437
CONCERNED ABOUT INGRESS AND

03:06:55.504 --> 03:06:58.006
EGRESS AND I KNOW SENATOR-

03:06:58.073 --> 03:06:59.341
YOU'VE BEEN TO THE INCIDENT

03:06:59.408 --> 03:07:00.876
COMMAND YOU BEEN TAKEN OUT OF

03:07:00.943 --> 03:07:02.878
ON TOURS LIKE I HAVE WITH THE

03:07:02.945 --> 03:07:03.912
SCENES OF SOME OF THE WORST

03:07:03.979 --> 03:07:06.348
FIRES AND- IN CALIFORNIA OVER

03:07:06.415 --> 03:07:07.215
THE PAST FEW YEARS YOU'VE SEEN

03:07:07.282 --> 03:07:09.585
THE- BURNT OUT CARCASSES OF-

03:07:09.651 --> 03:07:11.053
VEHICLES IN. PLACES WHERE

03:07:11.119 --> 03:07:13.188
PEOPLE HAVE PERISHED AS A

03:07:13.255 --> 03:07:16.224
RESULT OF- THERE BEING A LACK

03:07:16.291 --> 03:07:19.261
OF ABILITY TO GET OUT AND HOW

03:07:19.328 --> 03:07:21.330
IT WAS DIFFICULT FOR FIRE

03:07:21.396 --> 03:07:24.433
SERVICES TO GET IN TO- AND

03:07:24.499 --> 03:07:27.069
EMERGENCY SERVICES TO GET IN TO

03:07:27.135 --> 03:07:28.604
VERY AS FAR AS- SO THESE ARE

03:07:28.670 --> 03:07:31.840
EXTREMELY M. AND- IMPORTANT-

03:07:31.907 --> 03:07:35.744
ISSUES. AND AGAIN I THINK THE

03:07:35.811 --> 03:07:37.512
BETTER STANDARDS DO OFFER SOME

03:07:37.579 --> 03:07:39.181
PROTECTION- AND THEY'RE

03:07:39.247 --> 03:07:42.417
CERTAINLY APPROPRIATE FOR- FOR-

03:07:42.484 --> 03:07:47.055
REBUILDS AND REMODELS. BUT I

03:07:47.122 --> 03:07:49.625
THINK WE NEED TO BE. VERY

03:07:49.691 --> 03:07:51.159
CAREFUL ABOUT MAKING BLANKET

03:07:51.226 --> 03:07:53.261
STATEMENTS ABOUT JUST YOU KNOW

03:07:53.328 --> 03:07:56.732
THAT WE WOULD- LOCATE NEW

03:07:56.798 --> 03:07:59.067
DEVELOPMENTS IN HARM'S WAY- AND

03:07:59.134 --> 03:08:01.069
I'M VERY VERY CONCERNED THAT WE

03:08:01.136 --> 03:08:03.005
NOT HEAD DOWN THAT PATH I DON'T

03:08:03.071 --> 03:08:04.172
THINK YOUR BILL IS INTENDING TO

03:08:04.239 --> 03:08:07.109
DO THAT- IN ANY WAY SHAPE OR

03:08:07.175 --> 03:08:11.179
FORM- AND I THINK THAT- THE

03:08:11.246 --> 03:08:12.280
BILL'S A SIGNIFICANT

03:08:12.347 --> 03:08:14.316
IMPROVEMENT. OVER WHAT THE LAW

03:08:14.383 --> 03:08:17.119
IS TODAY- SO I WILL BE

03:08:17.185 --> 03:08:19.121
SUPPORTING THE BILL I DO HAVE

03:08:19.187 --> 03:08:20.022
FIVE ONE REMAINING ISSUE THAT

03:08:20.088 --> 03:08:23.158
WE'VE SPOKEN ABOUT BRIEFLY AND-

03:08:23.225 --> 03:08:28.163
THAT IS WHETHER- I THIS BILL-

03:08:28.230 --> 03:08:31.466
SPECIFICALLY ADDRESSES ISSUES I

03:08:31.533 --> 03:08:34.036
THINK IT'S CLEAR- AND- I'LL ASK

03:08:34.102 --> 03:08:36.338
YOU TO CLARIFY AGAIN THAT- OF

03:08:36.405 --> 03:08:39.341
THE BILL- DOES NOT. ADDRESS

03:08:39.408 --> 03:08:41.510
COMMERCIAL STRUCTURES OTHER

03:08:41.576 --> 03:08:43.378
THAN IN A MIXED USE TYPE OF

03:08:43.445 --> 03:08:49.985
CONTEXT- BUT- SCHOOLS AND-

03:08:50.052 --> 03:08:51.753
UNIVERSITIES FOR EXAMPLE WHICH

03:08:51.820 --> 03:08:54.122
IS OF SIGNIFICANT CONCERN AND-

03:08:54.189 --> 03:08:55.957
ONE AREA THAT I REPRESENT ARE

03:08:56.024 --> 03:08:58.193
NOT COVERED. AND I WILL JUST

03:08:58.260 --> 03:08:59.294
SAY FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE

03:08:59.361 --> 03:09:01.463
PUBLIC IN THE CASE OF THE ONE

03:09:01.530 --> 03:09:03.165
UNIVERSITY THAT I KNOW OF THAT

03:09:03.231 --> 03:09:07.335
EXISTS AND- THE- HIGH FIRA

03:09:07.402 --> 03:09:09.604
HAZARDS. STONE THAT WOULD BE

03:09:09.671 --> 03:09:14.209
PEPPERED NINE- THEY HAVE- IN MY

03:09:14.276 --> 03:09:16.678
DISTRICT TO IMPLEMENTED- THE

03:09:16.745 --> 03:09:17.879
HIGHEST STANDARDS OF FIRE

03:09:17.946 --> 03:09:19.715
PROTECTION AND OF WITHSTOOD

03:09:19.781 --> 03:09:22.184
SEVERAL- FIRES THAT HAVE COME
