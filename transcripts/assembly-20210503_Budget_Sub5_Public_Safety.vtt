BASIC RESPONSIBILITY OF THE BSE

00:50:43.507 --> 00:50:45.509

WITHOUT PROMISE FOR

00:51:08.298 --> 00:51:10.534
IMPROVEMENT. MORE INSPECTIONS

00:51:10.600 --> 00:51:11.601
AND FOLLOW UP TECHNICAL

MAJOR HEALTH AND SAFETY HAZARDS

00:51:32.189 --> 00:51:34.224
ARE SWEPT UNDER THE RUG.

00:51:34.291 --> 00:51:36.660
STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS

OUT BIENNIAL INSPECTIONS THIS

00:51:42.599 --> 00:51:44.067
PROPOSAL DOES NOT INCREASE THAT

00:51:44.134 --> 00:51:45.769
REQUIREMENT IN FACT THIS

00:51:45.836 --> 00:51:47.337
FLEXIBILITY BUILT INTO THE

00:51:47.404 --> 00:51:49.473
PROPOSAL NOTING THAT FACILITIES

00:51:49.539 --> 00:51:50.407
FOUND TO HAVE SIGNIFICANT

00:51:50.474 --> 00:51:53.477
ISSUES QUOTE MIGHT RECEIVE

00:51:53.543 --> 00:51:53.944
ANOTHER COMPREHENSIVE

00:51:54.010 --> 00:51:55.412
INSPECTION. THIS IS

00:51:55.479 --> 00:51:56.913
PARTICULARLY CONCERNING SINCE

00:51:56.980 --> 00:51:58.648
THE PSEC TAKES A NARROW VIEW OF

00:51:58.715 --> 00:52:00.484
ITS RESPONSIBILITIES AND USES

00:52:00.550 --> 00:52:01.751
ITS DISCRETION TO ACT IN

00:52:01.818 --> 00:52:03.553
SERVICE OF COUNTIES RATHER THAN

00:52:03.620 --> 00:52:05.088
EFFECTIVE OVERSIGHT AND

00:52:05.155 --> 00:52:07.457
TRANSPARENCY. THE PROPOSAL

00:52:07.524 --> 00:52:09.025
ALLOWS THE AGENCY TO CONTINUE

00:52:09.092 --> 00:52:10.560
TO USE ITS DISCRETION FOR HANDS

00:52:10.627 --> 00:52:12.562
OFF APPROACH TO THE DETRIMENT

00:52:12.629 --> 00:52:13.897
OF PEOPLE INCARCERATED INSIDE

00:52:13.964 --> 00:52:16.066
LOCAL FACILITIES. IT'S WITH

00:52:16.132 --> 00:52:17.901
THIS THAT WE MUST AGAIN ASK FOR

00:52:17.968 --> 00:52:19.169
THE PROPOSAL TO BE REJECTED

00:52:19.236 --> 00:52:20.704
EXCEPT FORGET GRANTING CLEAR

00:52:20.770 --> 00:52:22.439
AUTHORITY FOR UNANNOUNCED

00:52:22.506 --> 00:52:24.841
INSPECTIONS. THE FAILURE OF THE

00:52:24.908 --> 00:52:26.877
BSE C. MUST BE ADDRESSED IN

00:52:26.943 --> 00:52:28.879
RESTRUCTURING ITS LEADERSHIP AS

00:52:28.945 --> 00:52:30.881
A FIRST AND IMMEDIATE STAFF.

00:52:30.947 --> 00:52:32.582
ONGOING PROBLEMS AT THE AGENCY

00:52:32.649 --> 00:52:33.850
ARE CAUSED BY STRUCTURAL

00:52:33.917 --> 00:52:35.852
DEFICIENCIES INCLUDING FUNK

00:52:35.919 --> 00:52:37.320
THERE OVERSIGHT GOALS AND

00:52:37.387 --> 00:52:39.456
PROBLEMATIC LEADERSHIP. YES HE

00:52:39.523 --> 00:52:40.857
SEES WITH CITY REGULATIONS AND

00:52:40.924 --> 00:52:43.026
INSPECTIONS ARE FAILING DUE TO

00:52:43.093 --> 00:52:44.261
AN AGENCY CULTURE THAT

00:52:44.327 --> 00:52:46.563
PRIORITIZES CORRECTIONAL

00:52:46.630 --> 00:52:47.030
PERSPECTIVES OVER BEST

BOARD MEMBERS ARE SUBJECT TO

00:52:54.804 --> 00:52:57.807
INSPECTIONS. THE BSE SEAT NEEDS

00:52:57.874 --> 00:52:59.242
TO BE INDEPENDENT OF THE

00:52:59.309 --> 00:53:00.710
AGENCIES THAT THEY OVERSEE

00:53:00.777 --> 00:53:02.078

EXTENT THE LEGISLATURE DOES

00:53:58.668 --> 00:53:59.669
WANT TO MOVE FORWARD WITH OUR

00:53:59.736 --> 00:54:00.937
RECOMMENDED REFORMS WE THINK

00:54:01.004 --> 00:54:02.872
THAT IT WOULD. BE PREMATURE TO

PROGRAM WITH. WHATEVER GOALS

00:54:14.751 --> 00:54:16.586
THE LEGISLATURE AT SECOND

00:54:16.653 --> 00:54:18.288
STATUTE THE LEGISLATURE WOULD

00:54:18.355 --> 00:54:19.823
BE IN A MUCH BETTER POSITION TO

00:54:19.889 --> 00:54:24.027
RESOURCES ARE NEEDED-

00:54:24.094 --> 00:54:26.229
ENSURE THAT THE SEC'S PROGRAM

00:54:26.296 --> 00:54:28.431
CAN- CARRY OUT THOSE GOALS IN

00:54:28.498 --> 00:54:29.566
THAT IT IS OPERATING IN A

00:54:29.633 --> 00:54:33.303
MANNER THAT SUFFICIENT. AND

00:54:33.370 --> 00:54:33.870
CONSISTENT WITH LEGISLATIVE

00:54:33.937 --> 00:54:34.704
PRIORITIES. I'M THE OWNER TO

00:54:34.771 --> 00:54:36.873
EXTENT THAT THE LEGISLATURE.

00:54:36.940 --> 00:54:39.309
ATTITUDE NOT TO MOVE FORWARD

00:54:39.376 --> 00:54:41.678
WITH OUR RECOMMENDED REFORMS-

00:54:41.745 --> 00:54:43.013
WE WOULD ALSO RCOMMEND

00:54:43.079 --> 00:54:45.815
REJECTING THE RESOURCES ARE

00:54:45.882 --> 00:54:47.851
THERE THE REQUESTED STAFFING-

00:54:47.917 --> 00:54:50.253
BECAUSE- WE THINK THAT IT

00:54:50.320 --> 00:54:51.821
APPEARS THAT YOU KNOW BY AND

00:54:51.888 --> 00:54:54.057
LARGE THE SEC HAS KIND OF

00:54:54.124 --> 00:54:55.458
IMPLICITLY WELL DOESN'T HAVE

00:54:55.525 --> 00:54:57.193
EXPLICIT FILED STATUTORY GOAL

00:54:57.260 --> 00:54:59.596
CAN IMPLICITLY OPERATED- WITH

00:54:59.663 --> 00:55:03.066
THE GOAL OF HELPING COUNTIES.

00:55:03.133 --> 00:55:05.535
IDENTIFIED AND MEET LEGAL

00:55:05.602 --> 00:55:07.303
REQUIREMENTS AND THAT IS ONE OF

00:55:07.370 --> 00:55:08.038
THE FOUR GOALS THAT WE

00:55:08.104 --> 00:55:09.606
RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE

00:55:09.673 --> 00:55:15.779
ESTABLISHED FOR PSEC- THE DATE

00:55:15.845 --> 00:55:17.614
CHANGES THATTHE FCC HAVE BEEN

00:55:17.681 --> 00:55:18.481
MAKING OVER THE PAST YEAR IN

00:55:18.548 --> 00:55:21.284
THE POOL AND THE PROPOSED-

00:55:21.351 --> 00:55:22.919
BEFORE YOU AS WELL AS THE

00:55:22.986 --> 00:55:24.287
RESOURCES BEING REQUESTED WOULD

00:55:24.354 --> 00:55:27.457
LARGELY. GO TO SUPPORTING THIS

00:55:27.524 --> 00:55:29.492
CALL AND NOT TO THE OTHER THREE

00:55:29.559 --> 00:55:31.828
GOALS THAT WE RECOMMENDED-

00:55:31.895 --> 00:55:34.130
WHICH FOR EXAMPLE WERE TO

00:55:34.197 --> 00:55:36.833
PROVIDE INCREASED TRANSPARENCY-

00:55:36.900 --> 00:55:37.701
AND ACCOUNTABILITY OR

00:55:37.767 --> 00:55:40.704
FACILITATE ACCOUNTABILITY AND

00:55:40.770 --> 00:55:44.207
TRANSPARENCY. FOUNDED TENSION

00:55:44.274 --> 00:55:46.576
TO. AND SO WITH THAT SAID- WE

00:55:46.643 --> 00:55:49.579
THINK THERE WE DISEASE HASN'T

00:55:49.646 --> 00:55:51.648
BEEN ABLE TO PROVIDE US JUST TO

00:55:51.715 --> 00:55:54.350
THE- THAT THERE IS A NEED TO

00:55:54.417 --> 00:55:56.252
PROVIDE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES

00:55:56.319 --> 00:55:56.953
FOR THAT ONE PARTICULAR GOAL

00:55:57.020 --> 00:56:00.056
OF- HELPING ME LOCAL DETENTION

00:56:00.123 --> 00:56:01.758
FACILITIES AND DETERMINE MEET

00:56:01.825 --> 00:56:03.426
LEGAL REQUIREMENTS IN OTHER

00:56:03.493 --> 00:56:05.562
WORDS IT APPEARS THE PROPOSAL

00:56:05.628 --> 00:56:06.596
WOULD LARGELY INCREASE THE

00:56:06.663 --> 00:56:08.598
SERVICE LEVEL TO CITIES AND

00:56:08.665 --> 00:56:11.334
COUNTIES BUT WE HAVEN'T HEARD.

00:56:11.401 --> 00:56:12.435
ANY EVIDENCE FROM CITIES AND

00:56:12.502 --> 00:56:13.870
COUNTIES ADJUSTING THE CURRENT

00:56:13.937 --> 00:56:15.205
SERVICE SERVICE LEVEL IS

00:56:15.271 --> 00:56:16.406
INADEQUATE SO WITHOUT REASON WE

00:56:16.473 --> 00:56:17.440
WOULD REJECT THE PROPOSAL

00:56:17.507 --> 00:56:19.476
RECOMMEND REJECTING EVEN IF ON

00:56:19.542 --> 00:56:20.443
THE LEGISLATURE IS NOT

00:56:20.510 --> 00:56:22.178
INTERESTED IN MOVING FORWARD

00:56:22.245 --> 00:56:24.514
WITH OUR RECOMMENDED REFORMS-

00:56:24.581 --> 00:56:26.816
AND THEN ONCE THAT FINAL NOTE

00:56:26.883 --> 00:56:28.318

00:56:48.972 --> 00:56:53.042
MAKE SENSE- OUR LIST OF WHAT

00:56:53.109 --> 00:56:54.711

DO KNOW THAT THERE IS

01:08:22.531 --> 01:08:23.966
CONSIDERABLE UNCERTAINTY ABOUT

01:08:24.033 --> 01:08:26.001
THE FUTURE POPULATION TRENDS-

01:08:26.068 --> 01:08:27.970
THERE ARE OTHER FACTORS AS WELL

01:08:28.037 --> 01:08:28.704
INCLUDING COMPANY NINETEEN

01:08:28.771 --> 01:08:31.040
PANDEMIC. EMPHASIZING THE NEED

01:08:31.106 --> 01:08:32.141
FOR INCREASED BASED SO WE

01:08:32.208 --> 01:08:33.342
AREN'T SURE NECESSARILY WHAT

01:08:33.409 --> 01:08:34.710
CAPACITY MIGHT LOOK LIKE IN THE

01:08:34.777 --> 01:08:36.312
FUTURE GIVEN THOSE- AND

01:08:36.378 --> 01:08:38.013
INTERROGATION ISSUES WE ALSO

01:08:38.080 --> 01:08:40.182
WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT- THERE

01:08:40.249 --> 01:08:41.750
IS A SIGNIFICANT BACKLOG BOTH

01:08:41.817 --> 01:08:43.419
IN THE COUNTY JAILS AND IN THE

01:08:43.486 --> 01:08:45.321
STATE COURT SYSTEMS. WILL

01:08:45.387 --> 01:08:47.289
LIKELY RESULT IN SOME INCREASE

01:08:47.356 --> 01:08:48.824
IN PRISON POPULATION IN THE

01:08:48.891 --> 01:08:50.392
NEAR FUTURE AND THERE ARE

01:08:50.459 --> 01:08:52.561
SEVERAL- CONCERNS AND PROBLEMS

01:08:52.628 --> 01:08:54.163
WITH IDENTIFYING BREAKING FOR

01:08:54.230 --> 01:08:55.764
FUTURE CLOSURE OR EVEN

01:08:55.831 --> 01:08:58.067
INCLUDING ON A LIST- THOSE

01:08:58.134 --> 01:09:00.002
MEDICAL ISSUES WITH STAFFING.

01:09:00.069 --> 01:09:01.937
WE ANNOUNCE ESTRELAS THAT THE

01:09:02.004 --> 01:09:04.006
ALEJO'S RECOMMENDED A CERTAIN

01:09:04.073 --> 01:09:05.274
NUMBER PRISON BETTER LIKELY

01:09:05.341 --> 01:09:06.709
CANDIDATES FOR CLOSURE WE

01:09:06.775 --> 01:09:07.910
ANTICIPATE THAT THERE COULD BE

01:09:07.977 --> 01:09:10.312
STAFFING CONCERNS YOU CAN ALSO.

01:09:10.379 --> 01:09:11.714
CAUSE ISSUES WITH IMPROVING

01:09:11.780 --> 01:09:12.748
THOSE FACILITIES IN THE

01:09:12.815 --> 01:09:14.149
MEANTIME WHILE WE WAIT FOR THAT

01:09:14.216 --> 01:09:15.885
REASON CLOSER TO BE DETERMINED

01:09:15.951 --> 01:09:17.353
IF THOSE INSTITUTIONS IF THE

01:09:17.419 --> 01:09:18.487
LEGISLATURE HOLDS OFF ON

01:09:18.554 --> 01:09:19.555
ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR THINGS

01:09:19.622 --> 01:09:20.489
LIKE FACILITIES OUR

01:09:20.556 --> 01:09:21.624
PROGRAMMING. I MAKE A

01:09:21.690 --> 01:09:23.959
COMPROMISE IN A- STAFF SAFETY

01:09:24.026 --> 01:09:25.628
ORDER ON REHABILITATIVE PROGRAM

01:09:25.694 --> 01:09:33.602
AT THAT FACILITIES. AND SO

01:09:33.669 --> 01:09:34.236
AGAIN WE ARE REALLY. SINCE AS

01:09:34.303 --> 01:09:35.404
WELL WE MAKING FUTURE INVEST IN

01:09:35.471 --> 01:09:36.872
PRISON THAT ARE. FOR CLOSE BUT

01:09:36.939 --> 01:09:38.073
WE CAN WANT IT IT'S BEING THE-

01:09:38.140 --> 01:09:40.109
I. AND REPEAT SOME ISSUES THAT

01:09:40.175 --> 01:09:41.110
WE HAD IN THE PAST. A PREVIOUS

01:09:41.176 --> 01:09:42.344
THANK TWELVE ZERO WAS FOR

01:09:42.411 --> 01:09:44.046
CLOSURE. IT DIDN'T END UP

01:09:44.113 --> 01:09:45.147
HAPPENING AND THERE WERE SOME

01:09:45.214 --> 01:09:47.550
SIGNIFICANT. LOSSES THERE FOR

01:09:47.616 --> 01:09:49.718
HEALTHCARE FACILITIES- IT

01:09:49.785 --> 01:09:50.619
DIDN'T OCCUR BECAUSE THE

01:09:50.686 --> 01:09:52.521
ANTICIPATION. FOR CLOSURE BUT

01:09:52.588 --> 01:09:54.089
IT DIDN'T HAPPEN SO CAN WE

01:09:54.156 --> 01:09:56.025
UNDERSTAND THE CONCERN BUT IT'S

01:09:56.091 --> 01:09:58.093
VERY DIFFICULT AND I'M SORRY TO

01:09:58.160 --> 01:09:59.695
PROVIDE LISTS OF. POTENTIAL

01:09:59.762 --> 01:10:01.497
PRISON CLOSURES WITHOUT KIND OF

01:10:01.564 --> 01:10:05.868
FULLY ASSESSING. THE CURRENT

01:10:05.935 --> 01:10:06.502
SITUATION WHAT THINGS WILL LOOK

01:10:06.569 --> 01:10:10.239
LIKE. MANAGER YES THE JUNGLE IF

01:10:10.306 --> 01:10:12.107
I MAY THIS IS CAITLYN L'ITALIEN

01:10:12.174 --> 01:10:15.344
JUST TO QUICKLY OFFER- SOME AN

01:10:15.411 --> 01:10:16.478
ALTERNATIVE PERSPECTIVE ON

01:10:16.545 --> 01:10:19.248
THOSE POINTS- THAT MINISTRATION

01:10:19.315 --> 01:10:20.783
IS PROJECTING A DECLINE IN THE

01:10:20.849 --> 01:10:23.953
INMATE POPULATION- THAT IT'S

01:10:24.019 --> 01:10:26.021
AND CONSISTENT WITH OUR

01:10:26.088 --> 01:10:28.157
ESTIMATES IS EXACTLY WHAT WE

01:10:28.223 --> 01:10:29.959
GET OUR ESTIMATE THAT- THE

01:10:30.025 --> 01:10:31.060
STATE COULD BE IN A POSITION TO

01:10:31.126 --> 01:10:33.696
CLOSE- 5% OVER THE NEXT FEW

01:10:33.762 --> 01:10:35.764
YEARS- WELL THERE THERE IS OF

01:10:35.831 --> 01:10:36.765
COURSE AND CERTAINLY THERE'S

01:10:36.832 --> 01:10:38.200
ALWAYS UNCERTAINTY- AROUND

01:10:38.267 --> 01:10:40.302
POPULATION PROJECTIONS AND WE

01:10:40.369 --> 01:10:41.503
WOULDN'T WE CERTAINLY WOULDN'T

01:10:41.570 --> 01:10:43.205
RECOMMEND MOVING FORWARD OUT OF

01:10:43.272 --> 01:10:44.273
PRISON CLOSURE IF IT WOULD

01:10:44.340 --> 01:10:47.009
COMPROMISE PUBLIC HEALTH OR-

01:10:47.076 --> 01:10:49.445
YOU KNOW. EXACERBATE A LAWSUIT

01:10:49.511 --> 01:10:52.681
SITUATION- HOWEVER WE DO THINK

01:10:52.748 --> 01:10:54.350
IT'S IMPORTANT TO FOR THE

01:10:54.416 --> 01:10:56.652
LEGISLATURE TO BE AWARE OF-

01:10:56.719 --> 01:10:58.687
WHAT PRISONS ARE LIMITATION IS

01:10:58.754 --> 01:11:00.089
CONSIDERING FOR CLOSURE SO THAT

01:11:00.155 --> 01:11:01.824
IT CAN MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS

01:11:01.890 --> 01:11:03.325
ABOUT CAPITAL OUTLAY AS THESE

01:11:03.392 --> 01:11:05.327
PROJECTS ARE VERY EXPENSIVE

01:11:05.394 --> 01:11:08.297
AND- THERE IS A VERY

01:11:08.364 --> 01:11:10.265
SIGNIFICANT NEED FOR CAPITAL

01:11:10.332 --> 01:11:11.634
OUTLAY IMPROVEMENTS ACROSS THE

01:11:11.700 --> 01:11:14.303
SYSTEM SO- WANT TO MAKE SURE

01:11:14.370 --> 01:11:15.771
THAT THAT THAT CAPITAL

01:11:15.838 --> 01:11:17.506
INVESTMENTS ARE MADE- WHERE

01:11:17.573 --> 01:11:18.507
THEY'RE MOST NEEDED MORE THERE

01:11:18.574 --> 01:11:19.541
AND HAVE THEM BUT THE BIGGEST

01:11:19.608 --> 01:11:20.676
LONG TERM BENEFITS FOR THE

01:11:20.743 --> 01:11:21.910
STATE'S OKAY YES THERE'S

01:11:21.977 --> 01:11:23.779
UNCERTAINTY ON THE POPULATION

01:11:23.846 --> 01:11:30.285
BUT WE STILL HAVEN'T WE'RE.

01:11:30.352 --> 01:11:30.953
MAKING DECISIONS NONETHELESS SO.

01:11:31.020 --> 01:11:32.688
THE HAVING FROM ON. AND THEN ON

01:11:32.755 --> 01:11:33.622
THE SECOND POINT ABOUT-

01:11:33.689 --> 01:11:35.257
STAFFING ISSUES. WE DON'T

01:11:35.324 --> 01:11:36.392
NECESSARILY SEE THAT AS A

01:11:36.458 --> 01:11:37.593
PROHIBITIVE ISSUE OF COURSE

01:11:37.660 --> 01:11:38.727
THERE'S ALWAYS GOING TO BE

01:11:38.794 --> 01:11:39.862
TRADE OFFS WITH ANY KIND OF

01:11:39.928 --> 01:11:41.296
OPERATIONAL DECISION AND

01:11:41.363 --> 01:11:43.866
PRESENT ANNOUNCEMENT- BUT THERE

01:11:43.932 --> 01:11:45.300
MAY BE ALTERNATIVE. SOLUTIONS

01:11:45.367 --> 01:11:47.269
TO CONSIDER SUCH AS OFFERING-

01:11:47.336 --> 01:11:49.271
BONUSES FOR STAFF TO AND I

01:11:49.338 --> 01:11:50.439
STAYED AT THE PRESENT UNTIL IT

01:11:50.506 --> 01:11:52.041
IS CLOSED- RATHER THAN MOVING

01:11:52.107 --> 01:11:54.143
ON- I ALSO KNOW THAT WHEN WE

01:11:54.209 --> 01:11:56.078
VISITED ACT C. R. C. IN THE

01:11:56.145 --> 01:11:57.579
MORNING HAD ACTUALLY INDICATED

01:11:57.646 --> 01:11:59.348
THAT SHE WAS USING. PRISON

01:11:59.415 --> 01:12:01.250
BEATS ARE EXPECT ARE PRESENT

01:12:01.317 --> 01:12:02.785
CLOSER TO THAT HAS BEEN A ON

01:12:02.851 --> 01:12:04.253
THAT PRISON OVER THE PAST.

01:12:04.319 --> 01:12:05.954
COUPLE DECADES AS A WAY TO

01:12:06.021 --> 01:12:07.556
MOTIVATE STAFF TO DO BETTER AND

01:12:07.623 --> 01:12:10.793
BETTER SO- AND IT'S CETAINLY-

01:12:10.859 --> 01:12:11.827
HAD BEEN AWARE THAT THE PRISON

01:12:11.894 --> 01:12:13.028
WAS HAD BEEN PUT ON THE

01:12:13.095 --> 01:12:14.263
CHOPPING BLOCK IN THE PAST BUT

01:12:14.329 --> 01:12:15.497
IT WHAT. IT SEEMED TO BE

01:12:15.564 --> 01:12:16.432
SOMETHING THAT ONLY KIND

01:12:16.498 --> 01:12:18.467
MOTIVATED THEM SO I JUST WANTED

01:12:18.534 --> 01:12:20.002
TO PUT OUT POINT OUT THOSE AT

01:12:20.069 --> 01:12:21.537
IS WELL AS THE FACT THAT STAFF

01:12:21.603 --> 01:12:22.971
MIGHT REALLY APPRECIATE KNOWING
