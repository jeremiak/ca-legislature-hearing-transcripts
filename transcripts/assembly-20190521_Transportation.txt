TRANSPORTATION COMMITTEE THE OVERSIGHT HEARING. TODAY'S HEARINGS AN OVERSIGHT HEARING TO REVIEW THE CALIFORNIA HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITIES TWENTY NINETEEN PROJECT UPDATE REPORT. THE AUTHORITY IS REQUIRED TO SUBMIT A PROJECT UPDATE REPORT EVERY TWO YEARS. NORMALLY THE PROJECT UPDATE REPORT PROVIDES A STATUS UPDATE ON THE PROJECT SINCE THE PREVIOUS YEARS. SINCE THE PREVIOUS YEAR'S BUSINESS PLAN. THE AUTHORITY IS NOT REQUIRED TO PUT THE PROJECT UPDATE REPORT OUT FOR PUBLIC COMMENT NOR DOES IT HAVE TO BE APPROVED BYTHE AUTHORITY BOARD OF DIRECTORS. THIS YEAR THE REPORT TAKES ON SPECIAL SIGNIFICANCE. THE REPORT REFLECTS OUR NEW GOVERNOR'S VISION FOR HIGH SPEED RAIL. AND THIS PROGRAM. IT'S ALSO IT ALSO REFLECTS WORK CONDUCTED BY THE EARLY TRAIN OPERATOR A PRIVATE SECTOR REAL OPERATOR FROM GERMANY. THE EARLY TRAIN -- SKEWS ME THE EARLY TRAIN OPERATOR WAS TASKED WITH STUDY SETTING THE WRITER SHIPPING COSTS. FOR IN TERMS SERVICE OPTIONS. WHEN AND WHERE WE CAN GET HIGH SPEED TRAINS UP AND RUNNING? THE REPORT WAS IT REPRESENTS A SHIFT IN THE FOCUS OF THE HIGH SPEED RAIL PROGRAM AWAY FROM THE COMPLETION OF THE VALUE TO VALLEY INITIAL OPERATING SEGMENT OR IOS. FROM SAN FRANCISCO TO BAKERSFIELD. TO A SHORTER BUILDING BLOCK A HIGH SPEED RAIL LINE FROM MERCED TO BAKERSFIELD. THE AUTHORITY ESTIMATES THE SO CALLED CENTRAL VALLEY LINE WILL COST EIGHTEEN POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS TO BUILD. IT WILL BE OPERATIONAL BY. TWENTY TWENTY EIGHT PLEASE RECALL IN TWENTY EIGHT AND TWO THOUSAND EIGHT THE VOTERS APPROVED PROPOSITION. ONE EIGHTY TO PROVIDE NINE BILLION DOLLARS IN BONDS TO HELP BUILD A FIVE HUNDRED MILE. HIGH SPEED RAIL SYSTEM FROM SAN FRANCISCO TO LOS ANGELES. AT THAT TIME THE ESTIMATE FOR THE FULL COST OF THE PROJECT WAS FORTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS. IT WAS TO BE COMPLETED. BY. TWENTY TWENTY SINCE THAT TIME WE'VE SEEN NUMEROUS VARIATIONS ON WHERE THE REAL LINE WOULD BE BUILT AND WHEN WE COULD EXPECT A COMPLETED SYSTEM. COSTA FLUCTUATED FROM. FROM A HIGH OF NEARLY ONE HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS. DOWN TO SIXTY FOUR BILLION AND MOST RECENTLY NOW SEVENTY SEVEN BILLION FOR THE FULL PHASE. FULL PHASE ONE SYSTEM BY TWENTY TWENTY THREE BY. TWENTY THIRTY THREE ALTHOUGH THE GOVERNOR REMAINS COMMITTED TO BUILDING FULL SYSTEM THIS NEW PLAN IS ABOUT WHAT THE STATE CAN DO. WITH THE RESOURCES THAT WE HAVE NOW. TODAY WE'RE HERE TO DISCUSS A PLAN TO BUILD A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY ONE MILE HIGH SPEED RAIL SYSTEM. FORMER SAID TO BAKERSFIELD. AND CONTINUE TO CONSTRUCT EARLY IMPROVEMENTS IN THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA A LOS ANGELES FOR A TOTAL OF TWENTY POINT FOUR BILLION. TO BE COMPLETED BY. TWENTY TWENTY EIGHT TWO MEMBERS THAT ARE HERE. AS THE FUNDING PARTNER IN THIS EFFORT WE THE LEGISLATURE SHARE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS PROJECT. GOVERNOR NEWSOME HAS CLEARL ARTICULATED THAT HE WANTS TO FOCUS THE LIMITED RESOURCES HE STATE HAS TO DEMONSTRATE THE VIABILITY. OF HIGH SPEED RAIL IN CALIFORNIA. THIS IS A PLAN TO DO THAT. THE CHALLENGES AND THERE ARE MANY. OR THAT THE SUCCESS OF IN TERMS. SERVICES HINGES ON NUMBER OF VARIABLES. SOME THERE UNDER THE CONTROL OF THE AUTHORITY. AND SOME THAT ARE NOT. FIRST THE PLAN RELIES HEAVILY ON COORDINATING SERVICE BETWEEN THE HIGH SPEED RAIL SYSTEM. AND THE EXISTING ACE COMMUTER RAIL AND SOME SAND WORKINGS. AMTRAK SERVICE. THE PLAN ONLY WORKS IF THE SYSTEMS COME TOGETHER TO PROVIDE A SEAMLESS INTEGRATED TRAVEL EXPERIENCE. ALL THREE SYSTEMS MUST MEET IN MERCED. FOLLOWING SPECIFIC TIME LINES AND BUDGETS [inaudible] SECOND. COSTS CONTINUE TO RISE. THE PLAN REVEALS ANOTHER ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION INCREASE IN THE CURRENT CENTRAL VALLEY CONSTRUCTION. POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLAR INCREASE IT. ADDITIONALLY THE ACTUAL PROJECT COST OF THE CENTRAL VALLEY LINE EXTENSIONS TO MERCED AND BIG BAKER SO COULD ACTUALLY BE HIGHER. THIRD DO WE REALLY HAVE THE FUNDING WE NEED. THE CENTRAL VALLEY LINE RELIES ON FUNDING FOR PROPOSITION ONE A ALL OF THE FEDERAL FUNDING. AND CAP AND TRADE. ALL OF THESE SOURCES POSE THEIR OWN UNIQUE RISKS. AS WE HEARD LOUD AND CLEAR. JUST LAST WEEK [inaudible] AND FINALLY. HOW DO WE DEAL WITH OUR FEDERAL PARTNERS? NOT ONLY DID THE FRA INFORMANTS LAST WEEK THAT THEY ARE D. OBLIGATING NEARLY A BILLION DOLLARS. IN FUNDING FOR THE PROJECT BUT THE OUT FOR A HAS SYSTEMATICALLY DISENGAGE FROM THE AUTHORITY IN A VARIETY OF OTHER FRONTS. TODAY'S HEARINGS ABOUT FULLY UNDERSTANDING THE PLAN BEFORE US. INCLUDING ALL OF THESE MOVING PIECES. SO THAT SO THAT WE THE LEGISLATURE CAN MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS ABOUT THE FUTURE OF THIS PROJECT. AND BETTER UNDERSTAND THE ACTIONS THAT WE WILL NEED TO TAKE IN THE COMING MONTHS. WE WILL HEAR TODAY FROM THE NEW CHAIR OF THE AUTHORITY BOARD OF DIRECTORS MANY MEN DONE SIR. WHO WE HAVE -- I'VE HAD THE PLEASURE OF MEETING IN MY OFFICE AND UNDERSTANDING HIS OBJECTIVES. WE HAVE ASKED GERMAN DOES TO TO LAY OUT THE GOVERNOR'S VISION FOR THE PROJECT.

GOOD AFTERNOON GENTLEMEN PLEASE START WHEN YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU NOW IT'S ONTARIO GREAT. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN FRAZIER AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS I'M IN MY NAME AND DON'T SIR. GERMAN OF THE CALIFORNIA HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITIES BOARD OF DIRECTORS. THANK YOU ALL FOR INVITING US TO SPEAK TODAY ABOUT THE STATUS OF THE HIGH SPEED RAIL PROGRAM. ALSO PRESENTING WITH ME AS YOU MENTIONED IS THE CALIFORNIA STATE TRANSPORTATION AGENCY SECRETARY BRIAN ENNIS WHO IS MENTIONED AS THE AUTHORITIES INCOMING CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER. AND DANNY CURTAIN OUR FELLOW BOARD MEMBER. AM I WILL FOCUS MY REMARKS ON THE GOVERNOR STRATEGY AND APPROACH. TO DEVELOPING HIGH SPEED RAIL IN CALIFORNIA THAN SECRETARY AND THIS WILL WALK YOU THROUGH THE KEY ELEMENTS OF THE PROJECT UPDATE REPORT. AND A BOARD MEMBER. CURTAIN WILL OFFER REMARKS IF THAT'S OKAY. SO MEMBERS THE HIGH SPEED RAIL PROGRAM IN CALIFORNIA IS AT A CROSSROADS. IN A RECENTLY RELEASED PROJECT UPDATE REPORT. LAYS OUT HOW THE AUTHORITY PLANS TO MOVE THE PROJECT FORWARD IN THE MONTHS AND YEARS AHEAD. THE PROJECT UPDATE REPORT RECONFIRMS GOVERNOR NEWSOME'S APPROACH TO HIGH SPEED RAIL. THE VISION THAT HE LAID OUT FIRST IN THE STATE OF THE STATE IN FEBRUARY. SOME OF SUGGESTED THAT THE STATE SHOULD WALK AWAY FOR MORE THAN A DECADE OF COLLABORATION IN PROGRESS THE BOTH REPUBLICAN AND DEMOCRATIC ADMINISTRATIONS IN A GENERATION OF LEGISLATORS. LEGISLATIVE LEADERS HAVE MADE TO BRING THE PROJECT THIS FAR. SUCH A PATH TO LEAVE CALIFORNIA HAVING SPENT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS. WITH NOTHING BUT LAWSUITS JOB LOSSES AND BILLIONS OF I USED TO SHOW FOR OUR DEBTS. GIVEN THOSE TWO OPTIONS. THE PATH FORWARD IS CLEAR. CALIFORNIA HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY WILL CONTINUE ITS EFFORTS TOWARDS GETTING A WORKING SESSION COMPLETED SECTION COMPLETED IN A RESPONSIBLE AND TRANSPARENT WAY. THERE WILL BE CHANGES IN ACHIEVING THIS VISION. FOR EXAMPLE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT NOTIFYING US LAST THURSDAY. OF THEIR DETERMINATION TO CANCEL A PREVIOUSLY AWARDED GRANT TO THE PROJECT OF NINE HUNDRED AND TWENTY NINE MILLION DOLLARS. WE WILL FIGHT THIS ILLEGAL ACTION AS YOU SAW TODAY AND CONTINUE OUR CONSTRUCTION OF HIGH SPEED RAIL IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. TO MAKE THE FULL SAN FRANCISCO TO LA SYSTEM A REALITY WE FIRST NEED TO BUILD A WORKING SEGMENT. THAT DEMONSTRATES HIGH SPEED RAIL TO THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC. BEFORE WE BEGIN DETAILING THE KEY ELEMENTS OF THE PROJECT UP THEY REPORT I'D LIKE TO SPEAK TO FOR A MOMENT ABOUT CREDIBILITY. SOMETHING THIS PROGRAM HAS STRUGGLED WITH MAINTAINING HONESTLY. THIS HAPPENS ON MANY MEGA PROJECTS THIS ONE IS GOING THROUGH THE NECESSARY PROCESS OF REORIENTATION. GETTING OUR HANDS AROUND EXACTLY WHERE WE ARE SO WE KNOW HOW TO GET TO OUR DESTINATION. WE KNOW WHERE WE WANT TO GO. THE VOTERS GAVE US THAT DIRECTION BACK IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT WHEN THEY APPROVED A BOND MEASURE FOR HIGH SPEED RAIL IN CALIFORNIA. WE WILL MARCH FORWARD TO DELIVER ON THAT VISION. HOWEVER THIS CAN ONLY HAPPEN WITH CREDIBILITY. THE STORY WILL REESTABLISH CREDIBILITY THROUGH THREE THINGS TRANSPARENCY. KEEPING OUR COMMITMENTS. AND DELIVERING HIGH SPEED RAIL TRAINS WHILE LIVING WITHIN OUR MEANS. GOVERNOR NEWSOME HAS BEEN CLEAR. HE IS FOR DELIVERING HIGH SPEED RAIL FOR CALIFORNIANS IN A WAY THAT IS TRANSPARENT [inaudible] RESPONSIBLE REALISTIC AND ACCOUNTABLE. THIS IS THE APPROACH THE GOVERNOR LAID OUT. WHEN EXPRESSED HIS CONTINUED SUPPORT FOR THIS PROJECT? AND LET THERE BE NO DOUBT. HE SUPPORTS HIGH SPEED RAIL IN CALIFORNIA. HE SAID SO. HIGH SPEED RAIL IS MUCH MORE THAN A TRAIN PROJECT IT'S ABOUT ECONOMIC TRANSFORMATION. AND UNLOCKING THE ENORMOUS POTENTIAL OF THE VALLEY AND BY THE VALIUM AT THE CENTRAL VALLEY. LET'S TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT TRANSPARENCY. THE AUTHORITIES ALREADY COMMITTED TO THIS VERY AGGRESSIVELY UNDER MY LEADERSHIP. MOST OBVIOUSLY THROUGH THIS STAB WHICH MEANT AND STAFFING OF THE FINANCE AND AUDIT COMMITTEE WHO MET THIS MORNING. WHERE PROJECT CHALLENGES TRENDS AND OPPORTUNITIES ARE DISCUSSED IN PUBLIC IN DETAIL AND OF COURSE ALL OF THE EFFORT A DOCUMENTS ARE AAILABLE ONLINE FOR THE PUBLIC TO SEE? WE'VE ADDED TWO NEW MEMBERS TO THE FINANCE AND AUDIT COMMITTEE AND NOW HAVE A MONTHLY UPDATE. FROM THE EFFORT NAY CHAIRMAN MISTER RICHARDS TO THE BOARD ON THE COMMITTEE'S ACTIVITIES WHICH WE ALSO DID TODAY. THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN BUSINESS PLAN WAS CANDID AND TRANSPARENT. IT WAS THE FIRST PLAN TO ASSIGN DOLLARS IN TIMES TO IDENTIFIED RISKS. AND IT USE RANGES TO ESTIMATE COSTS. HAS BEEN THE CASE TO THE OUT THE ENTIRE HISTORY OF THIS PROJECT WE DO NOT HAVE ALL THE FUNDING IN HAND TO DELIVER THE ENTIRE SYSTEM NOW. SO WE'RE GONNA GET THERE AS A GOVERNOR SUGGESTED IN BUILDING BLOCKS. JUST LIKE ANY OTHER FINANCIALLY CONSTRAIN TRANSPORTATION PROJECT US. THE GOVERNOR ASKED US TO DO MORE. IN THIS AREA OF TRANSPARENCY AND WE ARE. FOR THE GOVERNOR'S DIRECTION WE'VE HOUSE ESTABLISHED A TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY PAGE ON THE WEBSITE. WE'RE PROJECT CHANGE ORDERS CAN BE FOUND FOR EACH CONSTRUCTION PACKAGE. THIS PAGE INCLUDES HUNDREDS OF CHANGE ORDERS EXECUTED TO DATE AND THE SITE WILL BE UPDATED QUARTERLY GOING FORWARD. ON KEEPING OUR COMMITMENTS. LET'S BE CLEAR WHAT THE GOVERNOR SAID. WE HAVE COMMITTED TO FUND BOOK AND IMPROVEMENTS IN THE BAY AREA AND LOS ANGELES AND WE ARE KEEPING THOSE COMMITMENTS. THE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. THE AUTHORITY IS THE FUNDING PARTNER TO CALTRAIN. ELECTRIFICATION PROJECT WITH SIX HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A PROP ONE A PLUS ANOTHER HUNDRED AND THIRTEEN MILLION IN CAP AND FUND TRADES BEING DEPLOYED. IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA THE AUTHORITY AS DIRECTED SEVENTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS TO THE ROSECRANS MARK WHAT GRADE SEPARATION PROJECT. NUMBER ONE ON THE P. YOU SEE LIST OF MOST DANGEROUS GRADE SEPARATIONS. THE REMAINING BOOK AND FUNDS FOUR HUNDRED AND TWENTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS ARE COMMITTED TO THE LA UNION STATION IMPROVEMENTS. MOREOVER WE ARE COMMITTED TO COMPLETE THE ENVIRONMENTAL WORK FOR ALL SEGMENTS OF THE PHASE ONE SYSTEMS. BETWEEN SAN FRANCISCO AND LOS ANGELES ANAHEIM AND WE'RE DOING JUST THAT. THE REQUESTED NEPA SIMON FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO STREAMLINE THE ENVIRONMENTAL WORK. AND WORK IS SCHEDULED TO BE COMPLETED BY THAT ARE OF FEDERAL FUNDING AGREEMENT DEADLINE. THE STORY WAS VERY CLEARANCE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN BUSINESS PLAN ABOUT THE LESSONS IT'S LEARNED FROM GOING INTO CONSTRUCTION. PRIOR TO FULLY ADDRESSING THE CHALLENGES PRESENTED BY RIGHT OF WAY ACQUISITION UTILITY RELOCATION AND THIRD PARTY AGREEMENT ISSUES. WE'RE SMARTER NOW. AND COMMITTED TO NOT REPEATING THOSE MISTAKES. COMPLETING ENVIRONMENTAL WORK IN FRONT OF FUTURE CONSTRUCTION IS NECESSARY TO REFINE OUR COST ESTIMATES. ADVANCED DESIGN IDENTIFY AND MITIGATE RISKS TO DEVELOP STRATEGIES FOR PROJECT DEVELOPMENT WORK. AND READY SHARED QUARTERS FOR INVESTMENTS AS FUNDING OPPORTUNITIES BECOME MORE AVAILABLE. MOREOVER THE AUTHORITY BOARD OF DIRECTORS IS BROUGHT IN A NEW LEADERSHIP TEAM THAT IS FOCUSED ON PROJECT DELIVERY. UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF OUR CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER JOE HEDGES. PROJECT CONTROLS ARE BETTER MANAGE THAN THEY'VE EVER BEEN ON THIS PROJECT. RISK ISSUES ARE BEING IDENTIFIED MANAGED MITIGATED AND QUANTIFIED AND DISPLAYED VERY TRANSPARENTLY. AND SECRETARY AND THIS IS GOING TO DISCUSS HOW CONSTRUCTION WILL PROGRESS THIS YEAR AS A RESULT OF THAT HARD WORK. AS I SAID IN AS HE GOVERNOR SAID VERY CLEARLY THE PROJECT DOES NOT HAVE ALL THE FUNDING NEEDED TO COMPLETE THE ENTIRE PROJECT STATEWIDE. AND TO BE CLEAR IT NEVER HAS. PROP ONE A WIN PASSED PROVIDED ONLY 20% OF THE PROJECTS ESTIMATED COST. AND TODAY WITH THE STABLE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM THROUGH TWENTY TEN FEDERAL FUNDS. AND PROP ONE A FUNDING THE STATE HAS ACCESS TO JUST UNDER 30% OF THE PROJECTS ESTIMATED COSTS THE SET UP FROM 20%. WHEN PROP ONE IT WAS PASSED? SO HOW DO WE GO ABOUT MAKING HIGH SPEED RAIL REAL IN CALIFORNIA WITH IN THE FUNDING THAT WE HAVE TODAY. AUTHORITIES ALREADY BEEN BEGUN LOOKING AT THIS WHEN WE BROUGHT IN THE EARLY TRAIN OPERATOR IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN TO ADVISE ON OPERATIONAL ISSUES FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THE AUTHORITY DIRECTED THE TEO AS GERMAN FRAZIER MENTION TO ANALYZE THE COST. AND EARLY PASSENGER BENEFITS OF TWO SEPARATE POTENTIAL INTERIM EARLY SERVICE BUILDING BLOCKS WITHIN THE CENTER SILICON VALLEY TO CENTRAL VALLEY AND MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR EARLY IN TERMS SERVICE. THROUGH THIS WORK THE EARLY TRAIN OPERATOR FOUND THE MERCED FRESNO BAKERSFIELD IS THE ONLY SERVICE LINE THAT MAKES SENSE AND THE CENTRAL VALLEY. THE ONLY PLACE IN THE STATE WHERE THE ENVIRONMENT WORK IS COMPLETE OR NEAR COMPLETE AND CONSTRUCTION IS WELL UNDERWAY. THE PROJECT UPDATE REPORT. BRIAN WE'LL TALK ABOUT IN A MOMENT IT LAYS OUT THE PATH FORWARD. USING THE MERCED FRESNO BAKERSFIELD LINE A BUILDING BLOCK THAT MATCHES WITH THE VEIL FUNDING THAT WE HAVE. IN ADDITION PROVIDES A SUBSTANTIAL ECONOMIC BOOST TO THE FAST GROWING DYNAMIC PARTS OF THE STATE OR I GREW UP. ANCHORING ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT FOR THE RURAL RESILIENCE OF THE CENTRAL VALLEY. SO TO SUMMARIZE THE IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY WE WILL DELIVER HIGH SPEED RAIL IN CALIFORNIA BY. GETTING TRAINS ON THE GROUND AS SOON AS POSSIBLE IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY WHERE THE ENVIRONMENTAL WORK IS NEAR COMPLETION IN CONSTRUCTION IS ONGOING. WE WILL COMPLETE THE ENVIRONMENTAL WORK STATEWIDE BY. TWENTY TWENTY TWO WE WILL COMPLETE THE BOOK AND COMMITMENTS IN NORTHERN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. AND WILL BEGIN TO EXPAND THE SYSTEM CONSISTENT WITH PROP ONE NAY AS FEDERAL AND OR PRIVATE FUNDING OPPORTUNITIES MIDDLE MATERIALIZE AS WE DEMONSTRATE THAT WE CAN DELIVER. WE'RE GONNA DO THIS BY BEING TRANSPARENT ON THE OPPORTUNITIES AND THE CHALLENGES WE FACE. MAINTAINING OUR COMMITMENTS TO DELIVERING HIGH SPEED RAIL WITH WHILE DELIVERING WITHIN OUR MEANS. I'D LIKE TO CLOSE MY REMARKS. BY REMINDING YOU THAT THE IDEA OF A HIGH SPEED RAIL LINE CONNECTING THE TWO MOST POPULOUS REGIONS OF THE STATE THROUGH THE CENTRAL VALLEY IS REALLY SIGNIFICANT. WHICH IS WHY IT'S BEEN CHAMPION BY POLITICAL AND CIVIC LEADERS AND ADVANCED BY VOTERS. THE HIGH SPEED RAIL PROGRAM IS ALREADY CREATED TENS OF THOUSANDS OF JOBS SUPPORTED HUNDREDS OF SMALL BUSINESSES. CONTRIBUTED TO THREE BILLION DOLLARS IN WAGES AND SEVEN POINT SIX BILLION AND ECONOMIC INPUT. OUTPUT EXCUSE ME. MUCH OF THAT IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY WORKS BADLY NEEDED. VOTERS APPROVED THE PROJECT BECAUSE IT WAS OUR BEST AND PERHAPS OUR ONLY CHANCE TO CONNECT NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA IN ENVIRONMENTALLY SOUND WAY. HAVING SPENT MORE THAN A DECADE AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS HIGH SPEED RAIL IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION. PROGRESS YOU CAN SEE THROUGHOUT THE CENTRAL VALLEY. IN THIS PROJECT UP THEY REPORT THE AUTHORITY FOCUS IS THE LIMITED RESOURCES THE STATE HAS. IDENTIFIED STATE IS IDENTIFIED TO GET A WORKING SECTION THAT CAN DEMONSTRATE THE VIABILITY OF THAT BROADER PROJECT. LET ME TURN IT OVER TO SECRETARY AND SPENCER. THIS. GOOD AFTERNOON AND ONCE AGAIN BRIAN ANISE FROM THE STATE TRANSPORTATION AGENCY. I'M GOING TO PRESENT AN OVERVIEW WITH KEY THEMES INFORMATION CONCLUSIONS OF THE PROJECT UPDATE REPORT. THE PROJECT UP THE REPORT DOES BUILT ON THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN BUSINESS PLAN WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON EARLY SERVICE OPTIONS AN UPDATED COST IN RISKS. IT FOCUSES DELIVERY AROUND THE BUILDING BALK BLOCK APPROACH. DELIVERING WHAT WE CAN WITH WHAT WE HAVE. SHOWS THAT THE HIGH SPEED RAIL CAN DELIVER IN BUILDS CREDIBILITY THROUGH DELIVERY. DEMONSTRATES THE BENEFITS OF HIGH SPEED RAIL AS SOON AS PRACTICABLE. AND CONTINUES ADVANCING PROJECT DEVELOPMENT FOR THE FULL FIVE HUNDRED AND TWENTY MILES SYSTEM. THE PROJECT UPDATE REPORT ADDRESSES STATUTORILY REQUIRED REPORTING ELEMENTS SUCH AS UPDATES ON COST ACCOMPLISHMENTS. ISSUES AND RISKS ADDITIONALLY THIS YEAR'S PROJECT UPDATE REPORT INCLUDES ADDITIONAL INFORMATION THAT THE AUTHORITY COMMITTED TO INCLUDE. AT THE TIME OF LAST YEAR'S TWENTY EIGHTEEN BUSINESS PLAN. FIRST THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN BUSINESS PLAN. INDICATED A FUNDING GAP FOR THE VALLEY TO VALLEY SEGMENT. THERE WAS THE COST OF TIMING IN THE PROJECT -- PASSED BETWEEN YOUR AYE IN MADERA. THE AUTHORITY INDICATED THE PROJECT UPDATE REPORT WOULD INCLUDE AN ANALYSIS OF EARLY IN ARMS SERVICE IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND SEPARATELY FOR THE YOUR TO SANDWICHES CO SEGMENT. THE AUTHORITY TASK THE EARLY TRAIN OPERATOR TO COMPLETE THIS ANALYSIS OF COST AND PASSENGER BENEFITS FOR THESE TWO SEGMENTS. SECOND THE AUTHORITY ASKED THE GAO TO PERFORM A REVIEW OF OUR CAPITAL COST ESTIMATES. AND THIRD AFTER COMPLETING COST RISK EVALUATION UPDATE ESTIMATES AND APPLY MONEY CARLA RISK ANALYSIS TO ASSESS COST RANGES. AND FINALLY TO CONTINUE TO ADDRESS RISK AREAS AND MITIGATION STRATEGIES. THE CHILL VALUE WAITED OPTIONS FOR THE CENTRAL VALLEY IN THE BAY AREA PENINSULA CONCLUDED THAT FOR THE PENINSULA. OPERATING IN EARLY HIGH SPEED RAIL SERVICE OVER LANE ON THE CALTRAIN SERVICE DOES NOT CREATE A SUBSTANTIAL IMPACT. RIDERSHIP OVERALL DOES INCREASE A BIT. BUT SOME CALTRAIN WRITER SHIFT OVER TO HIGH SPEED RAIL. THE RIDERSHIP GAIN IS NOT AS GREAT AS IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. THE VEST SEGMENT FOR EARLY IN ARM SERVICE WAS DETERMINED TO BE THE MERCED TO BAKERSFIELD SEGMENT AND THE CENTRAL VALLEY. THAT SEGMENT WOULD DECREASE TRIP TIMES BY NINETY TWO HUNDRED MINUTES. AND ALMOST DOUBLE RAIL RIDERSHIP ACROSS ACE THE SAN JOAQUIN'S IN THE NEW HIGH SPEED RAIL SERVICE. IN EARLY INTERIM SERVICES NOT NEW IT IS SOMETHING THE AUTHORITIES BEEN DISCUSSING WITH THE FEDERAL RAILROAD ADMINISTRATION SINCE. TWENTY THIRTEEN IT IS CONSISTENT WITH THE AUTHORITIES BUILDING BLOCK APPROACH AND PUTS HIGH SPEED RAIL ASSETS TO USE. THE EARLY TRAIN OPERATOR CONCLUDED THAT THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT BENEFITS FROM EARLY OPERATION THE CENTRAL VALLEY BETWEEN MERCED FRESNO AND BAKERSFIELD. SUCH AS THOSE LISTED HERE REDUCE DEPENDENCY ON THE CURRENT PRIVATE FREIGHT RAILROAD INFRASTRUCTURE. CONNECTIVITY AND HIGHER FREQUENCIES TO LOCAL COMMUNITIES THAT CONTRIBUTE TO THE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND EASE OF ACCESS TO OPPORTUNITIES THROUGHOUT THE CENTRAL VALLEY. REDUCED VALLEY TO VALLEY RAMP UP PERIOD AS IT ALLOWS HIGH SPEED RAIL OPERATOR TO TEST AND ADJUST THE OPTIMAL RAIL SERVICE OFFERED TO THE COMMUNITIES. IMPROVED TOTAL QUARTER FAREBOX RECOVERY IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. REDUCE CO TWO EMISSIONS. AND SHORTER TRAVEL TIMES FOR PASSENGERS ENHANCING THE ATTRACTIVENESS OF PUBLIC TRANSPORT IN RESULTING IN HIGHER RIDERSHIP. THIS SLIDE ILLUSTRATES THE EARLY TRAIN OPERATORS ESTIMATES FOR THE CENTRAL VALLEY QUARTER COST IN REVENUES. WITHIN WITHOUT HIGH SPEED RAIL SERVICE. THESE FIGURES INCLUDE ACE IN SAN JOAQUIN SERVICE. THE SERVICE IS CURRENTLY RECEIVE OPERATING SUPPORT FROM THE STATE AS DO ALL INNER CITY IN COMMUTER RAIL SERVICES. WITH THE ADDITION OF HIGH SPEED RAIL AND THE RESULTING RIDERSHIP AND FARE BOX INCREASE THE OPERATING SUPPORT. NEED WOULD DECLINE FROM APPROXIMATELY EIGHTY THREE MILLION TO APPROXIMATELY SIXTY THREE MILLION. SECOND THE EARLY TRAIN OPERATOR REVIEW THE CAPITAL COST ESTIMATES AND PERFORM BENCHMARKING. AGAINST -- COST CATEGORIES THAT ARE NOT LOCATION DEPENDENT SUCH AS TIMELY VIADUCTS AND BRIDGES AND COMPARE THAT TO COST EXPERIENCED IN GERMANY. SOME CONDITIONS DIFFER BETWEEN THE COUNTRIES FOR EXAMPLE U. S. ISSUES AROUND SEISMIC REQUIREMENTS AND STATE FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS WHICH IS BY AMERICA. THE ANALYSIS SUGGESTS SOME OPPORTUNITY FOR COST SAVINGS WHICH WILL FURTHER BE EXPLORED DURING PRELIMINARY ENGINEERING AND FINAL DESIGN PHASES. THIRD THAT PROJECT UP THE REPORT INCLUDES A MORE RIGOROUS AND UPDATED CAPITAL COST REVIEW FOR THE CENTRAL VALLEY. AS INDICATED ON THE SLIDE. THE PROJECT UP A REPORT MOVES FROM HIGH PROBABILITY TEN TO A RISK BASED PROBABILITY SEVENTY CONFIDENCE LEVEL. AND IN DOING SO INCREASES THE BUDGET BY ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS. THIS IS A 17% INCREASE OVER THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN PROGRAM BASELINE OF TEN POINT SIX BILLION. AND THERE ARE THREE MAIN DRIVERS. NINE POINT 3% OF THE INCREASE IS DUE TO ADDITIONAL CONTINGENCY TO MANAGE RISK. FOUR POINT 5% IS REVISED SPECIFIC COST ESTIMATES AND THREE POINT 4% DISCO CHANGES. THIS TOTALS TO A ONE POINT. EIGHT ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLAR INCREASE AND CREATES A MORE PRUDENT CONTINGENCY. OF ONE POINT FIVE BILLION TO MANAGE RISKS. THIS SLIDE COMPARES THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN BUSINESS PLAN COST BASE LINE AND RANGE TO THOSE FOR THE TWENTY NINETEEN PROJECT UPDATE REPORT. AS INDICATED ON THE PRIOR SLIDE THE LARGEST CHANGE IS USING A MORE CONSERVATIVE PROBABILITY SEVENTY BASELINE AND BUILDING AND A HIGHER CONTINGENCY. THE PROJECT UP THE REPORT ALSO UPDATES FUNDING BOTH ACTUAL REVENUES RECEIVED TO DATE AND FUTURE ESTIMATES. REVENUE COUNTED IS THROUGH TWENTY THIRTY WHICH IS THE CURRENT EXPIRATION OF THE STATE'S CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM. THE PROJECT AT THE REPORT COMPARES FUNDING CAPACITY. TO COST ESTIMATES. THEY NOW ALSO SHOWS MORE THAN SUFFICIENT FUNDING TO COMPLETE FEDERAL THE FEDERAL PROJECT AND FOR FILL REGIONAL BOOK AND COMMITMENTS. IT ALSO SHOWS THE MERCED FRESNO BAKERSFIELD SEGMENT IS WITHIN OUR FUNDING CAPACITY WITH CONSERVATIVE CAP AND TRADE REVENUE ASSUMPTIONS. AND ASSUMING THE LEGAL FEDERAL THE OBLIGATION OF FUNDS IS ULTIMATELY UNSUCCESSFUL. THIS CHARTER DEMONSTRATE SOME RECENT AUCTION RESULTS FROM THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM. THE AUTHORITY IS CURRENTLY USING A CONSERVATIVE ASSUMPTION OF FIVE HUNDRED MILLION PER YEAR FROM CAP AND TRADE AUCTION PROCEEDS. THE A STORY TO SHARE OF THE FEBRUARY TWENTY NINETEEN CAP AND TRADE AUCTION THE MOST RECENT ONE REPORTED IS WAS TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTEEN MILLION. IN THE AUTHORITIES TOTAL SHARE FROM THE LAST FOR CAP AND TRADE OPTIONS. IS SEVEN HUNDRED AND SIXTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS. THIS SLIDE SHOWS THE REVENUE THAT IS DIRECTED TO THE HIGH SPEED RAIL PROJECT. A COUPLE OF NOTES. THE FEDERAL RAILROAD ADMINISTRATION HAS BEEN INDICATED. IS MADE A DECISION LAST WEEK TO MOVE FORWARD TO DE OBLIGATE THE TWENTY TEN GRANT. I WANT TO MENTION THE GOVERNOR STATEMENT ON THIS. THE GOVERNOR SAID THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ACTION IS A LEGAL AND A DIRECT ASSAULT ON CALIFORNIA ARE GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE. AND THOUSANDS OF CENTRAL VALLEY WORKERS WHO ARE BUILDING THIS PROJECT. JUST AS WE HAVE SEEN FROM THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION'S ATTACK ON OUR CLEAN AIR STANDARDS -- IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES AND COUNTLESS OTHER AREAS THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS TRYING TO EXACT POLITICAL RETRIBUTION ON OUR STATE. THIS IS CALIFORNIA'S MONEY APPROPRIATED BY CONGRESS AND WE WILL VIGOROUSLY DEFENDED IN COURT. THIS TABLE ALSO SHOWS THE RANGE OF CAP AND TRADE FUNDS TO THE CURRENT EXPIRATION OF THE PROGRAM IN. TWENTY THIRTY IT DOES NOT INCLUDE REVENUE AT THIS TIME FOR AN EXTENSION OF CAP AND TRADE BEYOND. TWENTY THIRTY AND AS PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED AT THE BASELINE REVENUE ASSUMPTIONS ASSUMES CAP AND TRADE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE RANGE AT FIVE HUNDRED MILLION PER YEAR. THIS CHART ON ON THIS SLIDE COMBINES BOTH REVENUES AND COST CURRENT COMMITMENTS THE FIRST BAR ON THE BAR CHART. INCLUDING A HUNDRED NINETEEN MILE CENTRAL VALLEY CONSTRUCTION COMPLAINING SAN FRANCISCO TO LA ANAHEIM ENVIRONMENTAL WORK IN BOOKING COMMITMENTS ALL THESE TOTAL FIFTEEN POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS. AT IN THE EXTENSION OF BAKERSFIELD IN PURCHASING TRAINS THE SECOND BAR. INCREASES THE TOTAL COST TO SEVENTEEN POINT NINE BILLION AND FINALLY THE EXTENSION TO MERCED. ON THE THIRD BAR BRINGS THE TOTAL TO TWENTY POINT FOUR BILLION. THE TOP GREEN LINE SURE THE REVENUE LEVEL IF THREE DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS OF CAP AND TRADE. FROM -- FOR ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED MILLION A YEAR TO UP TO SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION PER YEAR ON THE TOP GREEN BAR. PROJECT UP THE REPORT AS SUMMARIZES AS THE LAW REQUIRES SOME OF THE ACTIVITIES THAT HAVE OCCURRED SINCE THE BUSINESS PLAN. INCLUDING SUBMIT MAJOR ACHIEVEMENTS IN FEBRUARY OF THIS YEAR A STATE ROUTE NINETY NINE FOR EXAMPLE WAS COMPLETED AND OPENED A PUBLIC -- YEAR PRIOR -- THE ARE A GRANT -- REIMBURSEMENT DEADLINE WAS MET BY THE AUTHORITY. AND MEANWHILE -- THERE'S BEEN MORE THAN TWENTY SEVEN HUNDRED CONSTRUCTION JOBS -- CREATED SINCE THE START OF THE PROJECT. PROGRAM RISK. AS AN EXTENSIVE EXTENSIVE SECTION ON RISK -- WHICH LOOKS AT BOTH A DISCUSSION OF THE ON GOING RISK AND MITIGATION MEASURES THE AUTHORITY IS IS TAKING TO TRY TO REDUCE THESE RISK. AT THE AUTHORITY DOES HAVE A RISK A ROBUST RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS TO ASSESS CONTROL AND MONITOR RISK ONCE IDENTIFIED. IN IS A COUPLE EXAMPLES OF OF HOW WE MITIGATE RISK -- LAST YEAR WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATURE A BILL WAS PASSED SB ELEVEN SEVENTY TWO WHICH STREAMLINES THE RIGHT AWAY ACQUISITION PROCESS AND WE APPRECIATE THE LEGISLATURE SUPPORT IN THAT AND THIS IS REDUCING THE RISK FROM RIGHT AWAY ACQUISITION BECAUSE IT STREAMLINES THE PROCESS TO GIVE THE AUTHORITY SOMETHING SIMILAR TO WHAT CALTRAIN CALTRANS. AND THE US STATE -- WATER RESOURCE -- STEVE THAT DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES EMPLOYEES. A COUPLE KEY A KEY TAKE AWAYS FROM THE PROJECT UP THE REPORT. NUMBER ONE THE EACH YEAR CONCLUDED THAT THE MERCED TO BAKERSFIELD IS THE BEST OPTION FOR EARLY SERVICE IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. THE P. T. O. WILL CONTINUE TO REVIEW THE TO THE THE T. O. COST REVIEW YIELDED SEVERAL OPPORTUNITIES TO REFINE COST AND WILL CONTINUE TO WORK ON THOSE. COST -- UPDATED COST AND SCOPE HAVE BEEN -- REVIEWED WITH THE MONTECARLO RISK ANALYSIS APPLIED IN AGAIN ON THIS CHART WE SHOW THE UPDATED COST ESTIMATES FOR THE PROJECT. FUNDING SHOW THAT THE FRESNO BAKERSFIELD -- SEGMENT SHE MERCED FRESNO BAKERSFIELD SEGMENT IS WITHIN THE FUNDING CAPACITY. THE LASTLY. THERE'S MANY REST OF THE PROJECT IS THE CHAIR NOTED THAT WE NEED TO FACE HEAD ON AND AN ADDRESS. UPCOMING IMPLEMENTATION STEPS -- THE BOARD I BELIEVE AT THIS MORNING'S MEETING ADOPTED A NEW TWENTY NINETEEN A PROGRAM BASELINE OF SCOPE SCHEDULE COSTA BUDGET -- OTHER ACTIVITIES AHEAD WILL BE SENT AS SELECTING SITES FOR CENTRAL VALLEY OPERATING AND MAINTENANCE FACILITIES. LONG LEAD PROCUREMENTS THE TRACK AND SYSTEMS PROCUREMENT IS ALREADY OUT TO FOR COMMENT FROM THE CONTRACTORS. OTHER LONGLEY PROCUREMENT SUCH AS TRAIN SETS AND CIVIL -- CONTRACTS -- THIS STORY IS PROCEEDING WITH THE SEQUEL FIRST STRATEGY ENDING UP FOR A RE ENGAGEMENT. CONTINUING TO BUILD ORGANIZATIONAL CAPACITY. AND WE'RE APPRECIATIVE OF THE BUDGET SUB COMMITTEES APPROVING MORE STATES STAFF THAT WILL TAKE OVER WORK FROM SOME OF THE PRIVATE CONSULTANTS ON THAT PROGRAM OVERSIGHT ACTIVITY. CONTINUING TO WORK WITH THE LEADERSHIP BASED IN SAN JOAQUIN AMTRAK AN INTEGRATED SERVICE PLANNING. AND LASTLY DELIVER DELIVER DELIVER. AT TWO ILLUSTRATE DELIVERY -- THIS CHART -- IT SHOWS HOW THE AUTHORITY IS CLOSELY TRACKING PROGRESS OF EACH STRUCTURE IN EACH CRIED WAY SEGMENT TO FLAG AND RESOLVE ISSUES. THIS SLIDE AND THE NEXT SHOW THE STRUCTURE BY STRUCTURE AND SEGMENT BY SEGMENT PROGRESS FOR CONSTRUCTION PACKAGE. ONE THE GRAPHIC INDICATES WHAT STRUCTURES ARE COMPLETE IN PROGRESS AND PENDING. THE NEXT SLIDE SHOWS THE PLANNED PROGRESS FOR THE HAVE TO BE ACHIEVED BY THE END OF THIS CALENDAR YEAR. THE THE BLUE IF YOU CAN -- SEE THE COLORS A REPRESENT -- COMPLETED -- PROJECTS THE GREEN OUR CONSTRUCTION THAT'S UNDER WAY. IN THE RED AND YELLOW REPRESENT PENDING ISSUES -- THIS IS FROM JANUARY TWENTY NINETEEN THE NEXT SLIDE. WILL SHOW DECEMBER. TWENTY NINETEEN AND IT ILLUSTRATES AND NUMBER OF REDS -- TURNING TO GREEN AND SOME OF THE GREEN STRAINING THE BLUE. SO THIS IS ANOTHER WAY THAT THE AUTHORITY IS BEING TRANSPARENT AND BEING OPEN TO ACCOUNTABILITY BECAUSE THE DELIVERY CHALLENGE NOW IS TO DELIVER ON THESE COMMITMENTS. IN ONE BY ONE COMPLETE ALL THE STRUCTURES AND ALL THE GUIDE WAY IN BETWEEN STRUCTURES. I JUST QUICKLY -- SAME THING FOR CONSTRUCTION PACKAGE TO THREE SINCE THE JANUARY -- STATUS OF ALL THE WORK ALONG THAT SEGMENT IN THE CIRCLES OF THE STRUCTURES THE LINES IN BETWEEN. ARE THE GUIDEWAY MILES. LOT OF RED IN THERE. AS WE GO TO DECEMBER WE SEE -- THE GREEN TURNING TO BLUE BEING COMPLETED IN SOME OF THE RED TURNING TO GREEN. LASTLY CONSTRUCTION PACKAGE FOR THE SAME. CURRENT STATUS IN JANUARY. AND WHERE THE AUTHORITY PLANS TO BE IN DECEMBER OF THIS YEAR. SO I'D LIKE TO CONCLUDE WITH THE SUMMARY OF THE SIGNIFICANT BENEFITS FOR RAILING CALIFORNIA UPON IMPLEMENTATION OF THE VESTMENTS OUTLINED IN THIS PROJECT UPDATE REPORT. FIRST CALTRAIN ELECTRIFICATION IN THE BAY AREA. ON A FIFTY MILE SEGMENT USED INITIALLY BY CALTRAIN AND LATER SHARED WITH HIGH SPEED RAIL. THIS INVESTMENT IMPROVE SPEEDS CAPACITY AND IMPROVES AIR QUALITY. SECOND CENTRAL VALLEY HIGH SPEED RAIL EARLY IN ARMS SERVICE ON A HUNDRED SEVENTY MACH ONE MILE SEGMENT. LINKING MERCED FRESNO AND BAKERSFIELD. AND LINK TO ACE AND SAN JOAQUIN RAIL FOR BAY AREA AND SACRAMENTO CONNECTIVITY. THIS GETS HIGH SPEED RAIL ON THE GROUND IN CALIFORNIA. LOS ANGELES UNION STATION RUN THROUGH TRACKS IN THE ROSE CURRENTS. MARQUARDT GRADE SEPARATION INCREASING SPEEDS AND CAPACITY THREE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA'S BUSIEST RAIL QUARTER. INITIALLY BENEFITING METROLINK IN THE AMTRAK SURFLINER SERVICE. IN LATER SHARED WITH HIGH SPEED RAIL. PLEADING ENVIRONMENTAL ANOTHER SEGMENTS TO CAN STAND NEW CONSTRUCTION HAS FUNDING IS IDENTIFIED -- THIS CONCLUDES THAT MY PART OF THE PRESENTATION AND I'M HAPPY TO TURN IT OVER TO DIRECTOR CURTAINS. MISTER CHAIR IF I COULD. TO ASK A COUPLE QUESTIONS OF THE EXPERIENCE OF THE PANEL. SURE IF YOU WOULDN'T MIND THE TO SHORE THE OKAY HOLD. A PRIVILEGE THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN FOR THE INVITATION THANK YOU MEMBERS GOOD AFTERNOON. MY NAME IS DANNY CURTAIN AND I AM VERY PROUD TO BE THE SPEAKER OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSEMBLY SUPPORT T. TO THE HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY. INITIALLY BY SPEAKER ATKINS AND RECENTLY A RE APPOINTED BY SPEAKER RENDON. MY GUIDANCE -- WAS VERY LIMITED BUT VERY CLEAR FIRST DO NO HARM. AND SECOND USE COMMON SENSE SO YOU GONNA GET A LAYMAN'S PERSPECTIVE HERE. I UNDERSTOOD THOSE INSTRUCTIONS AND I PLAN ON CONTINUING WITH THAT APPROACH. LET ME START BY SAYING I ABSOLUTELY SUPPORT THE CALIFORNIA HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY GOAL BUILDING A HIGH SPEED TRAIN TO FUNCTION AS THE BACKBONE OF CALIFORNIA'S RAIL TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM. CONNECTING NORTH AND SOUTH AND THE CENTRAL VALLEY IN BETWEEN. AS RESULT DRAMATICALLY IMPROVING CONNECTIVITY IN TRANSPORTATION CARTER'S THROUGHOUT THE STATE. AND A WHOLE HOST OF ANCILLARY ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL BENEFITS THAT GO WITH IT. IT'S A TRANSFORMATIONAL PROJECT. AS THE FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION FOR ME WAS AND STILL IS HOW DO YOU PROCEED TO REACH THAT GOAL IN A WAY THAT BRINGS THE MOST VALUE TO CALIFORNIA DURING THE PROCESS. NOT JUST AT THE END OF THE PROCESS. I WANT TO MAKE IT CLEAR I'M NOT HERE TO CRITICIZE PAST DECISIONS I WAS PART OF THOSE DECISIONS FOR ALMOST FOUR YEARS. I B<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt; FULLY BELIEVE THAT THE&lt;/c&gt;</u> MANAGEMENT AND THE BOARD OF THE HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY INCLUDING OUR CURRENT GOVERNOR PAST GOVERNORS AND PAST GOVERNORS HAVE OPERATED IN GOOD FAITH TO FULFILL ITS MANDATE. BUT IT IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER. THIS IS AN AGENCY FOCUSING ON A CLEAR MISSION TO GET A HIGH SPEED TRAIN UP AND RUNNING AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. EVERY BUSINESS PLAN IN EVERY PROJECT UPDATE CONTINUES TO EMPHASIZE THAT MISSION. THE COROLLARY BENEFITS ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT TRANSIT HUBS VIBRANT DOWNTOWN DEVELOPMENT HOUSING JOBS INCREASED MOBILITY. GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION ARE ALL PROUDLY TOUTED CORRECTLY. AND WITH GREAT ENTHUSIASM. THE ANALYSIS YOU SEE IN THE TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN PROJECT UPDATE REPORT IS AN ATTEMPT TO QUOTE ADAPTER CURRENT CIRCUMSTANCES IN PURSUIT OF HIGH SPEED RAILS GUIDING PRINCIPLE AGAIN QUOTE. SELECT THE LINE ESTABLISH A FUNDING PLAN BEGIN OFFERING A HIGH SPEED HIGH SPEED PASSENGER SERVICE AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. LET ME GO BACK A LITTLE BIT TO THE TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN BUSINESS PLAN THAT PLAN PRIORITIZE THE NORTHERN ROUTE REFER TO AS THE VALITY VALLEY SEGMENT. THAT DECISION WAS AN ADAPTATION TO CHANGING CONDITIONS FROM THE TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN BUSINESS PLAN. INSTEAD OF GOING SOUTH FROM THE CENTRAL VALLEY IT SWITCH SWITCH TO GO NORTH AGAIN TO ADVANCE THE MISSION QUOTE AN OPERATIONAL HIGH SPEED RAIL LINE AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. IT ALSO CONTINUE TO INCLUDE QUOTE COLLABORATING WITH OUR PARTNERS TO ADVANCE HIGH VALUE STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS STATEWIDE. AND CONCURRENT INVESTMENTS IN THE BURBANK LA ANAHEIM CAR DOOR. THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN BUSINESS PLAN ADOPTED A PHASED APPROACH TO THE NORTHERN SEGMENT. AGAIN ADAPTING TO THE RECOGNITION OF QUOTE A FUNDING SHORTFALL. FOR CONNECTING GILROY TO MADERA. THOSE ARE THE BUILDING BLOCKS THEY WERE WITH THE WE WERE. FOR TWO AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THE SHORTFALL WHICH BY THE EARLY OPERATOR HIRED BY THE AUTHORITY AS AN ADVISER WAS INSTRUCTED BY THE HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY TO STUDY THE POTENTIAL OPERATION. OF MERCED BAKERSFIELD FOR SAN FRANCISCO TO GILROY SEGMENTS. THE SEGMENTS ON EITHER SIDE OF THE PROJECT TO PASS. DEUTSCHE BAHN DETERMINED THAT THE SAN FRANCISCO GILROY SEGMENT WOULD HAVE A RELATIVELY SMALL IMPACT ON CAR TO RIDERSHIP. AS MR ANAS POINTED OUT THANK INCLUDED QUOTE MERCED FRESNO BAKERSFIELD SERVICE INTEGRATED WITH ACE IN SAN JOAQUIN SERVICE WAS THE ONLY EARLY OPERATION THE GENERATED INCREMENTAL VALUE ALL ACROSS ACROSS ALL SERVICES. THEY MADE A CHOICE BASED ON PAST DECISIONS BETWEEN TWO OPTIONS WHETHER ONE AGREES OR DISAGREES IT'S NOT AN ILLOGICAL OR UNDER REASONED DECISION. HOWEVER THIS LEGISLATURE BECAUSE YOU REPRESENT DIFFERENT AREAS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. BRING A FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT WAY OF LOOKING AT THE PROJECT BOTH AS INDIVIDUALS AND COLLECTIVELY. IT IS APPROPRIATE FOR YOU TO LOOK AT A DIFFERENT RANGE OF CHOICES. AS THE APPOINTEE OF THE CURRENT SPEAKER AND THE PREVIOUS SPEAKER IT IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT TO ME. THAT THE SPEAKER OF THE ASSEMBLY HAS PUBLICLY RAISE CONCERNS QUOTE. ABOUT COST AND SCHEDULE. PAUSE FOR REASSESSMENT. WE ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO LOOK AT THE LOWEST COST OPTIONS TO GET SOME CONNECTIVITY. THE CURRENT PLAN BENEFITS WILL NOT REACH THE STATE'S POPULATION CENTERS IN THE SOUTH. A MORE RIGOROUS REVIEW OF THE CONSTRUCTION OPTIONS THROUGHOUT THE STATE ON THE PROPOSED HIGH SPEED RAIL CORRIDOR. AND THE BENEFITS THEY MAY PROVIDE IS NOT AN UNREASONABLE INQUIRY FOR THIS LEGISLATURE. PENDING ON YOUR POINT OF VIEW BENEFITS PRODUCED IN THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPMENT OF A FULL HIGH SPEED RAIL SYSTEM. AS OPPOSED TO THE EARLIEST POSSIBLE COMPLETION OF INITIAL OPERATING HIGH SPEED RAIL SEGMENT. CAN BE SEEN AS EQUALLY OR MORE IMPORTANT. FOR EXAMPLE REDUCE TRAFFIC CONGESTION IN URBAN CORRIDORS ARE SCREAMING FOR RELIEF. THE MASS OF HOUSING CRISIS MEANS LOOKING FOR IMPROVE CONNECTIVITY TO LOW COST IN FOR THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING AREAS. THE URGENCY OF CLIMATE CHANGE IN REDUCING CARBON EMISSIONS THE FOCUS ON MORE RAIL PASSENGER MILES IN HEAVILY TRAFFICKED CORRIDORS AND LESS AUTOMOBILE TRAFFIC. COULD MEAN THAT URBAN FAST TRAIN SERVICE MAY PROVIDE GREATER GREENHOUSE GREAT GAS SAVINGS SOONER. TIMELINE FOR A DELIVERY FOR DELIVERY OF A PROJECT SEGMENT IS AN IMPORTANT FACTOR. ARE THERE LOCAL SEGMENTS THAT CAN BE COMPLETED THAT IMPROVE LOCAL MOBILITY AND REDUCE GREENHOUSE GASES SOONER. THESE CONCERNS ARE NOT RIGHT OR WRONG THEY'RE DIFFERENT. HOW YOU MEASURE MEASURE A SITUATION DEPENDS ON WHERE YOU VIEW IT FROM? THAT'S COMMONSENSE IT'S ALSO FEINSTEIN THEORY OF RELATIVITY. ASSEMBLY AND QUIRK IS LISTENING. ARE THERE CORRIDORS WERE HIGH SPEED RAIL FUNDS AND LOCAL MATCHING FUNDS CAN BE UTILIZED TO THE BENEFIT OF BOTH THE HIGH SPEED RAIL AND LOCAL TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM. WITH LACKEY WITH LOCAL MATCHING FUNDS CAN WE GET OTHER CARTER'S TO PROVIDE INDEPENDENT UTILITY BEYOND THE CENTRAL VALLEY. CAN THE AUTHORITY PARTNER WITH LOVE LOCAL AGENCIES TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR CONSTRUCTION DELIVERY. IS THERE A WAY TO MORE EFFECTIVELY UTILIZED ALREADY CONSTRUCTION CONSTRUCTED HIGHEST SPEED RAIL STATIONS. IS THERE THE POTENTIAL FOR PRIVATE SECTOR INVESTMENT IN ANY PART OF THE HIGH SPEED RAIL CORRIDOR OR CONNECTING CORRIDORS WHICH I THINK IS WORTHY OF A INVESTIGATION -- THERE SOME MORE THINK ABOUT I'LL TRY TO SPEED IT UP -- POLICY INTEGRATION. I BELIEVE WE NEED OVERSIGHT SYSTEM CAPABLE OF WHAT OF A WIDER OVERVIEW. AND I HAVE TO SAY THE TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN STATE RAIL PLAN WAS A GREAT START. ACTUALLY DEPARTMENT TO CONSOLIDATE FUNDING UNDER THE REAL PLAN UMBRELLA. MAYBE A SPECIAL GUBERNATORIAL LEGISLATIVE TASK FORCE HOPEFULLY WITH SOME AUTHORITY. THAT CAN BRING HARMONY TO COMPLEX PROBLEM SOLVING THAT TOO OFTEN OCCURS IN ISOLATION -- WITH A MORE ROBUST A ROBUST RAIL PLAN GOVERNANCE WITH THIS LEGISLATURE BE MORE WILLING. TO EXPLORE NEW SOURCES OF FUNDING FOR LOCAL RAIL FOR HIGH SPEED RAIL AND FOR TRANSPORTATION CONNECTIVITY IN GENERAL THAT'S AN IMPORTANT QUESTION. DON'T WAIT FOR THE FEDS WE NEED TO FIND MORE RESOURCES AT HOME. BUT IT IS CLEAR BECAUSE OF THE THREATS AND ACTIONS FROM THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION THE CHALLENGE FOR HIGH SPEED RAIL RIGHT NOW. THE CHALLENGES ARE GREATER THAN EVER. I DO WANT TO SPECIALLY THANK THE GOVERNOR FOR HIS FORTHRIGHT AND IMMEDIATE PUBLIC RESPONSE TO THAT ACTION. THE LARGEST INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT IN THE COUNTRY IS TOUGH ENOUGH WITHOUT UNNECESSARY HURDLES WE HERE IN CALIFORNIA NEED TO FIND A COMMON PURPOSE. IF WE CONTINUE TO VIEW EACH OTHER AS COMPETITORS OR WORSE ADVERSARIES BY REGION OR DISTRICT OR SYSTEM FOR SCARCE RESOURCES. THERE WILL BE WINNERS AND LOSERS BUT WE WILL BE FAR LESS SUCCESSFUL BUILDING WHAT WE NEED A STATEWIDE TRANSIT SYSTEM WITH HIGH SPEED RAIL AT ITS CORE. SO THE QUESTION REMAINS HOW DO WE BRING THE MOST VALUE TO CALIFORNIA IN THE PROCESS OF BUILDING A HIGH SPEED RAIL SYSTEM. THERE'S A SAYING IN EVERY CRISIS THERE IS OPPORTUNITY. IF THE F. R. IN THE PRESIDENT WANT TO BLOCK OR SLOW DOWN EXPANSION IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY BAKERSFIELD WARMER SAID THAT'S ON THEM. WE FIGHT BACK WE BUILD THE CENTRAL VALLEY SEGMENT AGREED UPON WITH THE F. R. A. BUT WE ALSO NEED TO LOOK AT ALTERNATIVES THAT MIGHT BE HARDER FOR ANYONE TO MEDDLE WITH. THAT MIGHT GET MORE TRACK ON THE GROUND AND THE BENEFITS THAT GO WITH IT. LET'S ADAPT TO CURRENT CIRCUMSTANCES. THERE ARE OPTIONS OUT THERE SOME SMALL SOME BIG. BUT IF THERE'S ANY STATE IN THE UNION CAPABLE OF BUILDING FOR THE FUTURE CAPABLE OF TURNING MILLIONS OF VOICES INTO ONE CHORUS. IS CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU MISTER MISTER DALY OF QUESTIONS THANK YOU YES -- MISTER ANISE -- MENTIONED -- AND MAYBE MR MEN DON SO ALSO THE PROJECTED DOUBLING OF RIDERSHIP FROM BAKERSFIELD TUMORS SAID -- AFTER THE SEGMENT IS COMPLETED -- WHAT ARE THE NUMBERS WHAT IS THE CURRENT RIDERSHIP IN THAT [inaudible] IN THAT. WHERE IS THAT? DOUBLING COME FROM. I'M NOT EVEN IS THERE EVEN A REAL HOOK UP RIGHT NOW. ANY SORT OF RAIL HOOK UP FROM BAKERSFIELD TO MERCED -- WELL YES -- SO CURRENTLY -- THE SAN JOAQUIN SERVICE OF AMTRAK THAT CENTRIC SERVER SO CORRECT YEAH THAT SAID TRAVELS FROM A BAKERSFIELD -- FRESNO MERCED -- STOCKTON THERE'S A SPLIT THERE WERE SOME OF THE LINES GO TO SACRAMENTO SOME GOING TO OAKLAND GOTCHA. YEAH AND THE RIDERSHIP NUMBERS -- I DON'T HAVE THOSE IMMEDIATELY SHARE THEM WITH YOU IT'S I I BELIEVE -- YOU KNOW WE SEE SOME OF THESE EXISTING SERVICES LIKE THE SAN JOAQUIN'S -- ARE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF CURRENTLY. ABOUT A MILLION AND A HALF WRITERS A YEAR. AND LOOKING AT AGAIN OF THAT I THINK AN 85% INCREASE IN THAT NUMBER -- SO GET HAPPY TO TO SHOW MORE DETAIL ON THAT BUT AGAIN THESE ARE -- THE REALLY THE HIGH SPEED RAIL -- PORTION ITSELF ABOUT ONE POINT SEVEN MILLION RIDERS A YEAR SO LOOKING AT ABOUT A DOUBLING OF RIDERSHIP IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND HOW MUCH OF THAT APPROXIMATE DOUBLING. IN A LOOK FORWARD TO THE NUMBERS IF YOU COULD FOR THEM THOSE NUMBERS TO US SO. A LITTLE BIT MORE SPECIFICALLY WOULD BE HELPFUL. HOW MUCH OF THAT DOUBLING? IS DEPENDENT ON THE VALLEY TO VALLEY CORRIDOR -- EXPECTATION. THE WORDS THE EXISTENCE THE FUTURE EXISTENCE OF VALLEY TO VALLEY AND NO CONSTRUCTION HAS STARTED YET HAS A VALID VALLEY IS IS A FUTURE. PROJECT SURE WILL VALLEY TO VALLEY IN THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN BUSINESS PLAN IS DESCRIBED AS SAN FRANCISCO TO BAKERSFIELD SO THE CENTRAL VALLEY SEGMENT THE CALTRAIN STATEMENT WOULD BE ALTERNATELY PART OF THE VALLEY TO VALLEY. I'M TALKING ABOUT -- ON THE MAP. BETWEEN MADERA AND WERE SAID. THERE'S A LINE THAT GOES OVER TO GILROY. YES NO CONSTRUCTION STARTED ON THE RIGHT HOW MUCH OF THE DOUBLING IN RIDERSHIP FROM BAKERSFIELD TO MERCED IS BASED UPON COMPLETING THAT SEGMENT. NONE OF IT SO THAT THE MODELING THAT WAS DONE BY THE EARLY TRAIN OPERATOR LOOKED AT COMPLETING HIGH SPEED RAIL FROM ARE SAID TO BAKERSFIELD. AND THEN THE CONNECTIVITY AND MERCED TO CASE AND THE SAN JOAQUIN SERVICES AND ASSUME ANY FURTHER CONSTRUCTION FOR THE PURPOSE OF THAT MODELING. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU AND AGAIN IF THOSE NUMBERS TO BE HELPFUL TO HAVE -- GOING FORWARD -- I'D LIKE TO GET ON THE TABLE -- I GUESS A LARGER QUESTION. WHICH IS. THERE ARE LIMITED FUNDS. BETWEEN NOW AND TWENTY THIRTY ARE THERE IS THIS UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THE FEDERAL PARTICIPATION. EVEN IF THE STATE WINS THAT LAWSUIT AND I HOPE WE DO -- IT'LL BE HARD TO EXPECT ANY OTHER. FUNDS FROM THE FEDS FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE -- WON'T IT SERVE MORE PERSONS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA [inaudible] TO EXPEDITE [inaudible] THE IMPROVEMENTS FROM ANAHEIM TO LA IN LA TO BURBANK. I JUST WANT TO PUT THAT ON THE TABLE AS A AS A CONCEPT AND I'M NOT SURE HAS BEEN FITTED VERY THOROUGHLY PUBLICLY IT MAY HAVE BEEN VETTED FIRE CONSULTANTS AND SO FORTH. BUT WITH MONEY BEING AS PRECIOUS AS IT IS AND THE POPULATION CENTER BEING IN. GREATER LA AREA -- YOU'VE COMMITTED FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS TO THE UNION STATION. PROJECT AND ANOTHER SEVENTY MILLION DOLLARS TO THE THE OVER CROSSING. PROJECT IN SANTA FE SPRINGS. BUT NOTHING BEYOND THAT. AND THERE'S NO. PROMISE OR HOPE. IN. IN THE PLAN BEYOND THAT. SHE CANIS THERE A WAY TO DO A AN ANALYSIS. TO HAVE GENUINE CHOICES ON THE TABLE. AN ANALYSIS FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF HOW MANY PERSONS. WILL BE IMPACTED BY THE EXPENDITURE OF MONEY IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. MAYBE BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE TWENTY TWENTY SIX A YEAR WE CAN SEE ON THE HORIZON. TWENTY THIRTY IS A LONG WAY OFF. AND EVEN TWENTY THIRTY THERE'S NO. PROMISE OF ANY FUNDING BEING SPENT. IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. BEYOND THE FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR UNION STATION AND THE SEVENTY FOR THE OVERPASS. YEP MAY I MAYBE ANSWER THAT IN TWO PARTS IF I COULD -- FIRST ON THE STATE FUNDING -- WITH THE HIGH SPEED RAIL YOUR CORRECTLY ARTICULATING THAT. BOOK IN FUNDING -- PROP ONE A ALSO INCLUDED SO CALLED TO CONNECTIVITY FUNDING AND WITH THAT WITH THE ENVIRONMENTAL WORK THAT HIGH SPEED RAIL IS DOING -- THE FUNDING ASSOCIATED WITH SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA FROM HIGH SPEED RAIL IS ABOUT ONE POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS -- ON TOP OF THAT -- WITH CAP AND TRADE I WAS SENATE BILL -- ONE WITH SOME OF THE OTHER FUNDING SOURCES AVAILABLE FOR RAIL IN THE STATE -- ABOUT FOUR POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS AND HAS BEEN DIRECTED TO SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA SINCE ABOUT TWENTY TWELVE SINCE THE FIRST APPROPRIATION -- INCLUDING PROP ONE MONEY. AB XP SP ONE EXCUSE ME SB ONE MY DIRECT CORRECT I'M TALKING ABOUT AS IN I I DIDN'T MEAN -- I SHOULD HAVE MENTIONED THE OBVIOUSLY THE ENVIRONMENTAL. FUNDING COMMITMENT IS SIGNIFICANT. AND WILL BE HELPFUL CORRECT I AM -- I MEANT TO SAY CONSTRUCTION MONEY SURE SURE. AND AT THE THE PROJECT UPDATE REPORT TO HAVE FOCUSED. AS AS WAS SAID COMMITTEDLAST YEAR WITH A BUSINESS PLAN TO LOOK AT THOSE TWO VALLEY TO VALLEY -- SEGMENTS BUT I KNOW THIS ISSUE FOR TEENS AROUND THE STATE WAS WAS DISCUSSED AT THE BOARD THIS MORNING. YEAH SO SAY COUPLE THINGS UP FOR SMALL TO VERY GOOD QUESTION THANK YOU FOR ASKING IT -- THE P. T. O. IN THEIR DIRECTION. TO THE NEXT STEPS FOR LOOKING AT WHAT THE CENTRAL VALLEY PORTION OF IT WAS SUGGESTED THAT -- THE EARLY TRAIN OPERATIONS IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY SHOULD UNDERTAKE A MORE DETAILED STUDY OF THE COST RIDERSHIP AND REVENUE POTENTIAL AS YOU WERE SUGGESTING. AND WE AGREED THIS MORNING TO UNDERTAKE THAT. SO WE WILL HAVE A MORE DETAILED REVIEW OF EXACTLY WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE INCLUDING. THE COMMERCIAL LEGAL STRUCTURING ETCETERA FOR MERCED TO BAKERSFIELD SO WE'LL HAVE ALL OF THE THE NUMBERS THAT YOU WERE ASKING ABOUT BUT THE MORE REFINED. BUSINESS PLAN ESTIMATE DONE IN CONJUNCTION WITH KPMG AND THE EARLY TRAIN OPERATOR. WE ALSO AGREED AT THE HIGH SPEED RAIL BOARD THAT FORTY THIS MORNING TO CONDUCT A PARALLEL ANALYSIS FOR A SET OF LINES AS YOU SUGGESTED INCLUDING THE ONES IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE HAVING AN HONEST AND TRANSPARENT DISCUSSION AROUND WHAT THOSE ALTERNATIVE LOOK LIKE. TO BE ABLE TO COMPARE -- AGAINST THE ONE OF THE GOVERNOR AND SUGGESTED IN HIS STATE OF THE STATE. IN WHAT THANK YOU FOR THAT THAT'S BELT THAT WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL AND I I REALLY APPRECIATED. WHAT WILL BE MEASURED THOUGH IN THOUGH IN THAT COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS IS IT WILL BE POTENTIAL RIDERSHIP YES OKAY? AND COST YES [inaudible] COST VERSES [inaudible] RIDERSHIP OKAY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. MR FUNG. THE JACKET I'M SORRY TO INTERRUPT I JUST MR DAILY ASSN EARLIER QUESTION AND SOME STAFF BROUGHT UP A RESPONSE SO HE CAN YOU KNOW YOU'RE RIDERSHIP QUESTIONS. YEAH THE SAN JOAQUIN'S -- WITHOUT HIGH SPEED RAIL ESTIMATED TO RIDERSHIP IN -- IN TWENTY TWENTY SIX TIME PERIOD BE ABOUT ONE POINT SEVEN MILLION RIDERS A YEAR. AND THAT'S PROJECTED TO GROW TO THREE POINT THREE MILLION A YEAR -- WITH -- HIGH SPEED RAIL AS PART OF THE CENTRAL VALLEY SYSTEM. AT ACE IS PROJECTED TO BE ABOUT TWO POINT FOUR MILLION WRITERS A YEAR GROWING TO A FOUR POINT THREE MILLION RIDERS A YEAR. AND AS I MENTIONED HIGH SPEED RAIL SEGMENT RIDERSHIP PROJECTED TO BE ABOUT ONE POINT. SEVEN MILLION A YEAR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER MENACE IN MISTER. MINT ON SOME. LET [inaudible] SISTER FOLK. UP. I THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY -- I APPRECIATE TO YOU GUYS BEING HERE I APPRECIATE THAT AND DOLLARS THE FACT THAT WE NEED TO ACTUALLY DO HAVE SOME CREDIBILITY AND IN IN A REAL BUSINESS PLAN A REAL UPDATE. AND SO LOOKING I APPRECIATE MISTER AND IS BEING HERE TO TESTIFY IN FRONT OF BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE AT THREE LAST WEEK AND IT WAS INDICATED AT THE AT THAT HE AT THAT HEARING THAT THERE ARE. CLEAR ASSUMPTIONS THAT NOW ARE NOT TRUE. SO I'M READING FROM PAGE THIRTY FOR THE REPORTS IS THE SIGNIFICANCE A SCHEDULE RISK FACING -- DETTORI TODAY IS THE FEDERAL THE MINISTRATIONS WITHDRAWING COMPLETING HIS RESPONSIBILITIES ON THE NATIONAL LEVEL POLICY ACT AND THEN A GIRL ALSO GOES ON TO SAY -- THE CALL BACK AT THE FEDERAL FUNDS SO. I NOTICED THAT IN YOUR PRESENTATION YOU SPENT THIRTY SECONDS TALKING ABOUT PUBLIC THE BIGGEST GLARING HOLE IN THE ROOF UPDATE WHICH IS. THAT THE NINE HUNDRED AND TWENTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS THAT YOU ARE ASSUMING TO BE IN YOUR FUNDING PLAN IS NO LONGER THERE. SO THEN HOW DO YOU. HOW CAN YOU HOW IS THIS HOW IS THIS UPDATE CREDIBLE? WELL. FIRST DRIVE THE PROJECT AT THE REPORT CLEARLY LAYS OUT THE FEDERAL RISK AT THAT FIRST FEDERAL LETTER WAS RECEIVED IN FEBRUARY OF THIS YEAR -- SO THAT PROJECT UPDATE REPORT INCLUDES THAT CLEAR DISCUSSION OF THAT RISK -- ON THURSDAY OF LAST WEEK A LETTER WAS RECEIVED FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. INDICATING THEY ARE PROCEEDING TO DE OBLIGATE THOSE FUNDS. CAN IS WAS MOVED MISSION BY THE CHAIR -- THIS MORNING -- CALIFORNIA -- FILED THE LAWSUIT -- TO HAVE A CORD -- REVERSE THAT -- ACTION DID YOU GET A GUARANTEE THAT'S GONNA HAPPEN. NO I CAN NOT KNOWING GET CORRECT RIGHT IN AND THEN ON TOP OF THAT THERE IS NO. RELATIONSHIP OR A WORKING TOGETHER RIGHT NOW BETWEEN THE FEDERAL AUTHORITY AND DIES AT LAST. AND I'M NOT GOING TO PROJECT WHAT THAT WHY THAT HAS OCCURRED BUT IT DOESN'T EXIST CORRECT THAT IS. NO DOUBT A CHALLENGE TO THE PROJECT -- FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS DISENGAGED IN SEVERAL WAYS -- THE FUNDING ISSUE DO YOU REYES BUT IN ADDITIONAL A SOME OF THE PARTICIPATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL DOCUMENTS IS ADDITIONALLY A RISK -- THE SEGMENT UNDER CONSTRUCTION NOW THE HUNDRED NINETEEN MILES IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY THAT DOES HAVE CLEARED ENVIRONMENTAL. BUT FOR THE EXTENSIONS -- THAT'S CLEARLY AN AREA WHERE WE NEED TO FEDERAL PARTICIPATION THROUGH THAT SO YOU AND I ARE SAYING THE EXACT SAME THING. I LIVE IN BAKERSFIELD I'M PROBABLY THE ONLY MEMBER HERE THAT REPRESENTS THE CENTER VALLEY. I SEE THE IMPACT OF THIS THIS PROJECT. IN MY COMMUNITY. I DRIVE PASSAGE EVERY SINGLE WEEK. SO HOW IS THIS REPORT CREDIBLE NOW THAT WE BOTH AGREED THAT THE GLARING HOLES EXIST. WELL AGAIN SIR RIGHT I BELIEVE THIS REPORT IS FULLY CREDIBLE BECAUSE WE'RE TRANSPARENTLY SIDING ON THESE RISK AND CITING WHAT WE'RE WORKING ON TOO MANY WE CAN REPEAT THE RISKS. THE REST A REAL RIGHT. YOU INDICATING THIS REPORT THAT YOU HAVE TWENTY POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS TO FINISH A SEGMENT THAT COST TWENTY POINT FOUR BILLION. NOW THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. HAS SAID THAT THEY'RE GOING TO TRY TO TAKE BACK OR ARE TAKING BACK NINE HUNDRED AND TWENTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS. SO YOU HAVE A WHOLE AT A MINIMUM WITHOUT ANY COST OVERRUNS OF NINE HUNDRED AND TWENTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS SO HOW DO YOU MAKE UP THAT DIFFERENCE. WHAT IF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT? DOES HARM IN TRYING TO PULL BACK THE FUNDING THAT'S BEEN GRANTED TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO THAT NINE HUNDRED TWENTY NINE MILLION. IS HARMFUL TO THIS TO THIS PROJECT THERE'S NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT -- THE THAT PARTICULAR FEDERAL MONEY BECAUSE OF THE AGREEMENT WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS A PART OF THIS TAPER MAX SO -- AT THIS POINT IN TIME THE MONEY BEING SPENT ON CENTRAL VALLEY CONSTRUCTION IS ALL STATE MONEY. SO WILK WE CONTINUE OUR CONSTRUCTION OF THE HUNDRED NINETEEN MILES WITH THE STATE TO THERE'S NO FEDERAL MONEY THAT GOES INTO THE CENTRAL VALLEY PROJECT -- THERE HAS BEEN -- THE THE REASON WHY YOU CHOSE A CENTRAL VALLEY IS BECAUSE THE FEDERAL AUTHORITY GRANTED HIM THIS PROJECT I WORKED IN CONGRESS AT THAT TIME. I WAS THERE. THE OUR FUNDS HAVE BEEN FULLY REIMBURSED AFTER THE CENTRAL VALLEY WORK. CURRENTLY THE STATE MONEY IS BEING SPENT UPON MEETING THE MATCH REQUIREMENTS THEN -- THE FEDERAL MONEY THE NINE HUNDRED TWENTY NINE MILLION IS SCHEDULED TO BE USED FOR THAT PHASE AROUND TWENTY TWENTY ONE PERIOD. SO AGAIN BUT YOU HAVE TO FINISH THIS PROJECT BY WENT. TWENTY TWENTY TWO THAT'S WHAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CLOSED BACK EVERYTHING. RIGHT UNDER THE STIMULUS OTHERS UNDER A ARE A THE IN EXCHANGE FOR THESE FUNDS YOU HAVE TO FINISH A BY. TWENTY TWENTY TWO THE STATE AUDITOR'S SAYS THAT YOU'VE GOT TO RAMP UP SO LARGE THAT YOU MAY NOT MAKE THE TWENTY TWENTY TWO DEADLINE. WE WE HAVE TO COMPLETE THE HUNDRED NINETY MILES BY TWENTY TWENTY TWO NOT THOUGHT THE TIRE RIGHT ON TWENTY TO HUNDRED RIGHT BUT THAT THAT IS IT SEEMS THOUGH SOME OF THE FUNDING BEING THAT RIGHT. THE THOUGHT THE AND AND THE ENVIRONMENT A CLEARANCE. THEFARM THE HUNDRED NINETY MILES IS ALREADY CLEAR OKAY SO BUT WHAT WE DO KNOW WE WE WE NEED A FEDERAL PARTNER THAT'S COLLABORATING WITH US. AND PUT IT BUT TO ACCESS THE THE PROBLEM NAY FUND YOU HAVE TO GET THE MOMENT SENSIBLE SEGMENT CRACKED UNDER PROP ONE A IT'S PART OF PART OF THE FEDERAL GRANT AGREEMENT. WELL THE PART OF THE FEDERAL GRANT AGREEMENT THIS IS CLEARING THE ENVIRONMENTAL DOCUMENTS FOR THE SAN FRANCISCO DALY ANAHEIM SEGMENT. A PART OF THAT IS A COMMITMENT OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO CLEAR THE NEPA WHEN THOSE DOCUMENTS ARE SUPPLIED TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SO WE WILL CONTINUE. THE ENVIRONMENTAL -- PROCESS -- AND WILL CONTINUE TO SUBMIT THOSE DOCUMENTS TO THE FEDS IT WOULD BE THEIR RESPONSIBILITY TO COMPLY WITH THE GRANT AGREEMENT BY DOING THEIR WORK ON THOSE ENVIRONMENTAL DOCUMENTS. THE ONE THING I I GUESS IT MIGHT I'M HEARING IS I'M HEARING. I DIDN'T I CAN IMAGINE I I COULD HEAR MORE UNCERTAINTY BUT I'M HEARING MORE UNCERTAINTY EVERY PRESENTATION I HEAR ON HIGH SPEED RAIL. I MEAN IS THAT DEEP DO YOU NOT SEE THAT. I CAN TRY THAT I THINK WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS PROVIDE TRANSPARENCY ABOUT WHAT THE UNCERTAINTY IS AND AS WE KNOW WHAT IT IS AND CAN QUANTIFY IT. WE ARE COMMUNICATING IT AND SO THAT THAT'S WHAT NOT TO BE TECHNICAL BUT THE THE MONEY CARLO ANALYSIS MOVING FROM AN A PROBABILITY OF 10% OF PROBABILITY OF 70% IS JUST BEING MORE SPECIFIC ABOUT WHAT THE RISKS ARE QUANTIFYING THEM SO WE'RE JUST AS WE GET MORE INFORMATION WE CAN. BE ABLE TO QUAN WHETHER WE'RE ALL MAKING DECISIONS ON IN PERFECT INFORMATION. BUT WITH THE MORE INFORMATION WE GET. THE MORE IMPERFECT THIS PROJECT SEEMS TO BE. I MEAN I I'M READING FROM PAGE FOURTEEN OF THE OF THE F. R. A. -- DECISION -- TO TO TO CALL BACK THE THE FUNDS IN TABLE THREE SAYS THESE ARE THE DELIVERABLES PROGRAM MEASURE PLAN DELIVERY DATE. TWENTY SIXTEEN THAT CUT CALIFORNIA'S ZERO THIRTY FAILED TO ADDRESS EFFORT REYES COMMONSENSE ACTUALLY TWENTY SEVENTEEN REJECTED TWENTY EIGHTEEN REJECTED THE ANNUAL WORK PLANS TWENTY SIXTEEN CALIFORNIA'S WE WROTE THIRTY FAILED TO ADDRESS EFFORT REYES COMMON SATISFACTORY. TWENTY SEVENTEEN SAID THE SAME THING TWENTY EIGHTEEN SAID THE SAME THING TO CENTRAL VALLEY PROJECT FINANCIAL PLAN TWENTY SIXTEEN C. H. RIGHT THE CALIFORNIA'S REAL FORTY FAILED TO ADDRESS EFFORT REYES COMMENTS AS FACTORY. TWENTY SEVENTEEN REJECTED TWENTY EIGHTEEN PROJECTED. THE ONLY PREDICTOR. A FUTURE BEHAVIOR IS PAST BEHAVIOR THE APPARATUS MADE THIS DECISION NOW YOU CAN SAY. I GET ALL THE RHETORIC I GET THAT YOU WANT TO BLAME THE ADMINISTRATION -- NUMBER THINGS BUT WE GET A DEAL REALITY. WE HAVE A REAL TAX DOLLARS ONLINE HERE. AND WE AT THE END RIGHT WE DON'T HAVE ANY YOU DON'T HAVE IN THIS PLAN THIS UPDATE ANY FUNDS POST. TWENTY THIRTY ON CAP AND TRADE CORRECT GOT IT AND IF I ANY FUNDING POSE. TWENTY THIRTY THAT'S CORRECT THAT'S CURRENT LAW SO WE TOOK THE CONSERVATIVE APPROACH OF NOT ASSUMING THAT EXTENSION FOR PURPOSES OF THE PROJECT GOT SUPPORT BUT YOU'RE ASKING US TO ASSUME A PROJECT NOW POST TWENTY THIRTY CORRECT. WELL WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IN THIS PLAN AGAIN AS AS THE THE EARLIER PRESENTATION INDICATED. LOOK AT THE RESOURCES WE HAVE TAKE A REALISTIC LOOK AT COST -- WE WERE MORE CONSERVATIVE IN THE SENSE OF A HIGHER PROBABILITY MODELS SO COSTS WENT UP A BIT HIGHER CONTINGENCY. LOOKING AT REVENUES WE ACTUALLY IN A SENSE BROUGHT REVENUES DOWN A BIT WE DIDN'T ASSUME CAP AND TRADE BEYOND TWENTY THIRTY FOR THOSE THIS PURPOSE. AGAIN LOOKED AT THE REVENUE WE HAD. AND THE COST AND PROVIDED IN THE PROJECT UPDATE REPORT A VERY SUBSTANTIAL RAIL BENEFIT OF INVESTMENT OF THE MONEY WE HAVE AND LOOKING AT THE BENEFITS THAT CAN PRODUCE. NOT JUST IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY BUT IN KEEPING THE COMMANDMENTS. BAY AREA. DELIVERABLES FOR CALTRAIN -- UNION STATION ECCENTRIC SO LET ME I NEED -- THESE DIVE INTO A LITTLE BIT OF A MISTER DALY WAS TALKING ABOUT THE RIDERSHIP NUMBERS THE NUMBERS I HAVE AT LEAST. THE AMTRAK SAM LOOKING RIDERSHIP NUMBERS IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN FOR SAID TO BIGGEST FILLED. HAS THE IS IS A TOTAL OF SEVENTY TWO AND THEN IN THE IN THE RIDERSHIP NUMBERS THAT YOU HAVE IN TERMS OF WHO WOULD RIDE HIGH SPEED RAIL. THAT SAME QUARTER YOU HAVE IT AT ONE POINT SIX MILLION WRITERS THAT'S A FIVE FOLD INCREASE WHAT ASSUMPTIONS OF GOT INTO IT. TO ASSUME THAT AT SUCH A LARGE RIDERSHIP BOB. WELL NOT A STRAIN NOT YOU KNOW NOT THAT NOT THE BOOKENDS JUST. BECAUSE RIGHT NOW WE'RE THE WE'RE ONLY TALKING ABOUT THE CENTRAL VALLEY WAIVERS WERE SAID TO SHAFT WELL I THINK CHAPTER. I MEAN YOU YOU YOU CAN SAY THAT YOU HAVE MONEY TO BIXEL BUT I THINK YOU DO BUT LET'S STIPULATE MERCED BIXEL HOW DO YOU GET THAT FIVE FOLD INCREASE. WHAT WAS MODELED WAS THE HIGH SPEED RAIL SERVICE A RUNNING TRAINS ABOUT EVERY HOUR? AND CONNECTING TO SAN JOAQUIN'S AN ACE IN MERCED AND LOOKING AT THE ENTIRE SYSTEM. OF THOSE OF THOSE -- THE SERVICES THAT ARE INTEGRATED -- TOGETHER AND THAT'S HOW THE THE RIDERSHIP NUMBERS WERE CALCULATED. IN YOU THE A FIVE FOLD INCREASE IS REALISTIC. WHAT'S A SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE IN THE SERVICE. SO YES -- THESE -- MODELING NUMBERS -- WERE BASED ON AT THE ANALYSIS USE FOR THE STATE RAIL PLAN -- SO -- WE STAND BESIDE THESE THESE ESTIMATES. MR FONG A WE HAVE OTHER USER AYE AYE AYE AYE AYE PROCEDURE I I JUST ABSOLUTE I I APPRECIATE YOU GUYS BEING HERE I I APPRECIATE YOU GUYS TAKING THE GRILLING THAT I THAT I AM -- THAT THAT -- HE'S CLEARLY -- I BELIEVE JUSTIFIED BECAUSE I THINK CALIFORNIANS ARE GROWING WEARY AND THEY'RE GOING MORE UPSET. THEY THEY THIS PROJECT IS AS I SAID IN MY OPENING STATEMENT WAY OFF TRACK THE THE HOLES ARE GETTING LARGER. NOW THE DELAYS ARE GETTING LARGER TO COST OVERRUNS CONTINUE TO PROCESS THEY'RE STILL -- FOR FEDERAL FUNDS THAT NO LONGER THAT THEY'RE THERE FOR A FUNDS NOW THAT NO LONGER EXIST. AND SO I MEAN IF WE'RE REALLY GOING TO BE SERIOUS AS AS A BODY AS BUSINESS THE LEGISLATURE TO TO BE STEWARDS OF THE TAX DOLLAR THIS PROJECT HAS TO BE REEVALUATED. AND I THINK AT LEAST AT A MINIMUM THE VOTERS SHOULD HAVE A SAY EITHER VOTE AGAIN ON THIS PROJECT THANK YOU. MR THANK YOU MISTER FONG MISTER FRAZIER ASKED ME TO CHAIR THE MEETING IN HIS ABSENCE WILL BE RETURNING SOON I HOPE -- I WANT TO GIVE OTHER MEMBERS A CHANCE TO MAKE COMMENTS OR ASK QUESTIONS AND I THINK MISTER CUNNINGHAM -- IS NEXT TO MISTER NAZARIAN DO YOU ARE YOU GOING TO HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS OKAY COULD ALSO GO TO MISTER CUNNINGHAM. MISTER FRASIER'S BACK SO I'M GIVEN THE GAVEL BACK TO HIM. GO AHEAD GEORGE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. SOME LOOKING AT PAGE FOURTEEN OF THE OF THE SLIDE THAT YOU GUYS PREPARED -- WANT TO DRAW YOUR ATTENTION TO THAT. IT'S IT'S STATES VERY CLEARLY -- THE THE PROJECT DOESN'T HAVE ALL THE FUNDING NEEDED TO COMPLETE THE ENTIRE PROJECTS STATE WIDE AND IT NEVER HAS. IT POINTS THAT'S A QUOTE IT POINTS OUT IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT THE PROP ONE A PAWN MEASURE PASSED WHICH PROVIDED 420% OF THE PROJECTS THAN ESTIMATED COSTS WHICH WILL NOW HAVE INCREASED SENSE. I BELIEVE THE CONTEMPLATION AT THE TIME WAS THAT THERE WOULD BE PRIVATE INVESTMENT IT WOULD BE SIGNIFICANT FEDERAL INVESTMENT AND THEN THE PROP TWENTY BONDS WOULD. WOULD MATCH. AS WELL SO THAT THERE WAS SORT OF THREE FUNDING SOURCES TO GET THE PROJECT COMPLETED. I KNOW YOU GUYS WERE NOT IN THE POSITION YOU'RE IN NOW BACK THEN BUT IN PLEASE CORRECT ME IN YOUR ANSWER OF THE FUN MISTAKEN ABOUT THAT. BUT THAT'S MY RECOLLECTION FROM THEN -- AND THEN IT NOTES IN. TWENTY EIGHTEEN WITH A STABLE JOB WHAT WE CALL GHG OUR FUNDS A PROGRAM THROUGH. TWENTY THIRTY PLUS FEDERAL FUNDS PLUS PROP ONE A FUNDING THE AUTHORITY HAS ACCESS TO JUST UNDER 30%. OF TODAY'S ESTIMATED PROJECT COST SO I WANT TO GIVE YOU ALL A CHANCE RESPOND I WANT TO ASK THE QUESTION MY CONSTITUENTS ASK ME. ALL THE TIME. HOW IS THIS THING GOING TO BE COMPLETED WHERE'S THE OTHER 70% BECAUSE WE KNOW THE FEDS ARE TRYING TO CLAW BACK MONEY I GET THERE'S A LAWSUIT OVER? SO THAT'S OUTCOME UNCERTAIN -- I BELIEVE CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG BUT THAT THE PRIVATE INVESTMENT IS NEVER MATERIALIZED. AND THE PROP ONE A FUNDS THAT ARE LEFT ARE -- WOEFULLY INADEQUATE TO PAY FOR THE ENTIRE SYSTEM SO WHERE IS THE OTHERS IF IF WE ASSUME THAT THE ALL THAT. WE HAVE THROUGH THE SOURCES IDENTIFIED 30% WHERE'S THE OTHER WELL THIS -- A PROJECT LIKE. OTHER AT BIG TRANSPORTATION OF THE PROJECTS OF THE PAST MY MENTION LIKE THE INTERSTATE HIGHWAY SYSTEM AS AN EXAMPLE -- CAM PROCEED IN BUILDING BLOCKS WHERE YOU HAVE USABLE SEGMENTS -- WERE YOU HAVE SIGNIFICANT BENEFITS -- WITH INITIAL SEGMENTS BEFORE THE ENTIRETY OF THE SYSTEM IS BUILT OUT -- SO IS INDICATED HERE -- THE WITH A CAP AND TRADE IN THE REVENUE IDENTIFIED -- THROUGH A TWENTY THIRTY THAT STE ENDS UP BEING ABOUT 30% OF THE OVERALL PROJECT COST -- WITH THAT FUNDING WE BELIEVE AS AS ONE OF THE SLIDES I GUESS THE SLIDE THAT STILL UP THERE ARE ARTICULATE AND THEIR SIGNIFICANT BENEFIT TO THE SYSTEM. I HAVING. UPON DELIVERING SOME OF THOSE BENEFITS -- BELIEVES THE THE BENEFIT OF HIGH SPEED RAIL WILL WILL BE DEMONSTRATED CLEARLY -- ALSO -- AS YOU SAY AT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT -- HAD ABOUT A TWO YEAR PERIOD OF FIVE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT IN HIGH SPEED RAIL NOT JUST IN CALIFORNIA BUT ACROSS THE COUNTRY -- THAT'S TWO THOUSAND IT WITH THE OUR FUNDS AND THEN THE FEDERAL FISCAL YEAR TWENTY TEN SINCE THEN THEY HAVE NOT COMMITTED SIGNIFICANT NEW MONEY -- FOR HIGH SPEED RAIL ANYWHERE IN THE IN THE COUNTRY BUT OTHER STATES ARE ALSO PURSUING HIGH SOME POINT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WILL COME BACK. AND BE A FUNDING PARTNER WITH NEW MONEY. FOR THE SYSTEM AND IN TERMS OF THE PRIVATE SECTOR -- COURSE THEY LOOK -- TO DE RISCO PROJECTS AND SO -- THEY'VE BEEN ENVISIONED AS A PART OF THE LATER -- FUNDING PARTNERS -- THERE ALSO -- I THINK LOOKING FOR A DEMONSTRATION OF THE BENEFIT OF HIGH SPEED RAIL THAT WILL BE DEMONSTRATED BY RIDERSHIP AND OTHER FACTORS WE WERE ABLE TO GET INITIAL SERVICE UP AND RUNNING. OKAY MY NEXT QUESTION IS IS THERE ARE PRESENTLY A VIABLE PLAN TO CONNECT. I GUESS WHAT WOULD BE BAKERSFIELD THE SOUTHERNMOST POINT OF THE CENTRAL VALLEY STATEMENT. TO DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES OR SOMEWHERE. DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES AND WHAT WOULD THAT PLAN ENTAILS BECAUSE IT SEEMS TO ME AND I'VE DRIVEN THE GRAPEVINE ON I FIVE MANY MANY TIMES -- THAT'S A CHALLENGING THING. TO GET TO GET RAIL SYSTEM EITHER OVER UNDER AROUND THAT SEEMS LIKE THAT WOULD BE QUITE A CHALLENGE. AND I I'M NOT. TRYING TO HOLD YOU GUYS ANYTHING I GET THE PEOPLE ARE LOOKING AT THIS BUT IS THERE PRESENTLY A VIABLE PLAN TO CONNECT BAKERSFIELD TO LOS ANGELES. WELL THAT DOES -- I THINK ACTUALLY TWO SEGMENTS THAT ARE UNDERGOING THE ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW RIGHT NOW BAKERSFIELD TO PALMDALE IN PALMDALE TO BURBANK. AS SO THAT IS UNDER STUDY IN THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROCESS THAT'LL HELP -- FURTHER REFINE OF THE COST OF THE ROUTE -- THOSE TYPE OF FACTORS -- IN THE MEANTIME -- THERE ARE PASSENGERS TODAY -- THAT MAKE A A BY RAIL TICKET -- TO COME FROM SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA NORTHERN CALIFORNIA -- SOME OF THEM WILL TAKE THE COAST STARLIGHT ON THE COAST OTHERS SAY DO A BUS CONNECTION FROM LOS ANGELES THAN CONNECTING BAKERSFIELD. AND A BOARDING A TRAIN ON BAKERSFIELD HIT THE THE POINTS TO THE NORTH -- THROUGH RAIL SERVICE -- WITH THE MERCED TO BAKERSFIELD -- EARLY BUILDING BLOCK OR INTERNET SERVICE -- THAT OPPORTUNITY WOULD STILL EXIST -- SOME CUSTOMERS WOULD CONTINUE -- TO TRAVEL INTO REGIONALLY -- WITH A FAST CONNECTION BETWEEN AT BAKERSFIELD IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. BUT ULTIMATELY FOR THE SERVICE THAT HAVE. I THINK AT HIGH SPEED RAIL PROVIDES -- YOU KNOW BUSES ARE CERTAINLY NOT GOING TO GET YOU THERE ARE YOU NEED TO DO THAT FOR HIGH SPEED RAIL INVESTMENT -- FROM BAKERSFIELD LINKING TO PALM DOWN ULTIMATELY TO BURBANK AND LOS ANGELES AREA -- WOULD YOU AGREE THAT THAT. WAS. SOMETHING THAT THE PROP ONE A VOTE WAS PREDICATED UPON. I BELIEVE THE VOTERS WERE MORE TOLD THE THE HIGH SPEED RAIL SERVICE WOULD CONNECT LOS ANGELES TO SAN FRANCISCO. IN IN UNDER TWO AND A HALF HOURS IF I RECALL CORRECTLY THAT'S CORRECT YEAH AND THE SYSTEM AS IT'S BEING BUILT IN BUILDING BLOCKS IS DESIGNED TO MEET THOSE REQUIREMENTS. OKAY THAT'S ALL I HAVE THANK YOU. MISTER IS THERE ANY JEFF QUESTIONS. I DID THANK YOU -- AND I DIDN'T WANT TO FOCUS TOO MUCH ON THIS FIRST OF ALL THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR FOR BEING HERE AND FOR OFFERING UP. UPDATE -- BUT GIVEN ONE OF THE QUESTION OF THE QUESTIONS THAT OF ONE OF OUR COLLEAGUES WAS ASKING. I THINK SOMEONE OF THE SIMPLE RESPONSES WOULD BE -- TO DEMONSTRATE HOW MUCH MONEY HAS BEEN SPENT SO FAR AND THE CENTRAL VALLEY. AND HOW MANY JOBS HAVE BEEN CREATED BECAUSE OF THAT AS A SMALL PART OF THIS WHOLE THING. BUT I THINK THAT'S THAT'S OF KEY POINT THAT -- IN THE QUESTION AND ANSWER. IT WAS NOT ADDRESSED ANDWHAT BENEFITS HAVE BEEN DERIVED LOCALLY -- AND ALSO TO POINT OUT HOW MANY OF THOSE JOBS -- EMPLOYED INDIVIDUALS WERE LOCAL FORCES INDIVIDUALS ARE EXPERTS COMING IN FROM. OTHER PLACES SO I IF WHEN YOU GET A CHANCE I'D APPRECIATE YOU. NOT NOW BUT LATER ON PROVIDING THAT INFORMATION BECAUSE I THINK THAT. IS A GREAT DEAL OF BENEFIT THAT MANY OTHER COLLEAGUES HERE WOULD HAVE BEEN -- PLEASED TO HAVE RECEIVED IN THEIR DISTRICTS -- THAT'S ONE COMMENT WAS MADE A LITTLE WHILE AGO ABOUT OVERSIGHT A PLEA BY MR CURTAIN. I WANTED. TO KNOW WHAT IN A PERFECT. WORLD SCENARIO THAT OVERSIGHT PROCESS WOULD LOOK LIKE AND AND MISTER CHAIRMAN HAVE YOU OTHER QUESTIONS ON FOLLOWING UP SO -- BECAUSE WE'VE OVERSIGHT IS A WRESTLING IN A PERFECT WORLD WHAT THAT WOULD LOOK LIKE I HAVE NO IDEA. THEY'LL NEVER BE SUCH A MISTER CURTAINS WORLD YEAH WELL MY MISTER CURTAINS WORLD WOULD BE THE ABILITY TO SOMEHOW OVERCOME THE SILOS THAT. EVERYBODY OPERATES IN AND IT'S JUST YOU MAY NATURE. IF THERE'S A WAY TO HAVE A BODY THAT OVERSEES THE WHOLE PROCESS SO THAT YOU INTEGRATE FUNDS IN A WAY THAT MAKES SENSE -- SO THAT DIFFERENT SYSTEMS CAN INTEGRATE TOGETHER IT'S VERY HARD INDEPENDENTLY -- NOBODY WANTS PUT THEIR CARDS ON THE TABLE SO YOU NEED A AND AND THE REAL PLANTS A GOOD START -- YOU KNOW MY THINKING HERE AND I BELIEVE THE BOARD SHOWS SOME INTEREST IN EXPRESSING THIS AND I DON'T WANT TO SPEAK TO FOR A LINE FOR THE BOARD BUT WE WILL BE LOOKING AT THE POTENTIAL FOR MATCHING MONEY WHEN WE ARE ADAPTING TO THE CIRCUMSTANCES. AND THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE TO DO I THINK SOME OF THE POINTS MADE ABOUT THE MONEY IS ARE GOING TO BE DEALT WITH AS THE CIRCUMSTANCES ALLOW. BUT WE HAVE TO LOOK OUTSIDE AND SEE IF THERE'S PRIVATE MATCHING MONEY OR PUBLIC MATCH I MEAN A LOCAL MATCHING MONEY -- I KNOW THERE ARE IS A PRIVATE. TRAIN BEING DISCUSSED FROM VEGAS. TO VICTORVILLE PALMDALE. THAT'S POSSIBLE PRIVATE MONEY IN THE IN THE LINKAGE TO OUR TRAIN BUT ALL OF THESE LOCAL TRANSPORTATION AGENCIES HAVE MONEY IF THEY WOULD IF WE WOULD GET MATCHING MONEY SO THAT MIGHT MAKE OUR MONEY GO FURTHER. THIS IS WHAT WE DO WE ADAPT SO. RAY ARE AT A COUPLE THINGS THAT THE QUESTIONS FIRST ON WE DEFINITELY WILL GET YOU THE NUMBERS ON THE ECONOMIC IMPACT BUT JUST TO GIVE A SENSE OF THAT. BETWEEN JULY SEVENTEEN IN JUNE. TWENTY EIGHTEEN ABOUT 18% OF THE FOURTEEN THOUSAND JOBS THAT WERE CREATED IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY OR FROM HIGH SPEED RAIL. AND IN FRESNO COUNTY. ABOUT ROUGHLY 50% OF THE TOTAL JOBS ADDED DURING THAT TIME PERIOD WEREFROM HIGH SPEED RAIL ONE AND 30% OF THOSE DIRECT FROM DIRECT EMPLOYMENT BY THE HIGH SPEED RAIL PROJECT SO IT'S A SUBSTANTIAL. ECONOMIC IMPACT AND WE DO HAVE ALL THOSE NUMBERS BROKE DOWN AS WELL AS A HOW MANY OF THOSE ARE IN DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES SMALL BUSINESSES THAT CENTERS WILL BE HAPPY TO GET THOSE -- AND THEN ARE ON OVERSIGHT I VIEW THIS AS AN EXTREMELY IMPORTANT PART OF THE ROLE BOTH OF THE HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY BOARD. TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE ASKING THE HARD QUESTIONS THAT SORT OF FINANCE AND AUDIT COMMITTEE REVIEW AND ALL THAT AND VERY TRANSPARENT WAY. AND IT'S ALSO OBVIOUSLY -- THE LEGISLATURE'S ROLE AS WELL TO PROVIDE THAT OVERSIGHT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN BUILD CONFIDENCE THAT WE ARE. DISPLAYING AS TRANSPARENTLY AS WE CAN WHAT'S GOING ON WHAT THE RISKS ARE WHAT WE'RE DOING ABOUT THAT THAT'S HOW YOU REBUILD CONFIDENCE SO. WHILE SOME OF THESE QUESTIONS ARE NOT THE MOST ONE WANTS TO ANSWER THAT'S WHAT OUR JOBS ARE SO WE APPRECIATE THE HARD QUESTIONS [inaudible] SO. TWO THINGS -- FIRST OF ALL I I DO APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE SAYING BUT PART OF THE CHALLENGE AND PART OF THE FRUSTRATION I'VE HAD BEING HERE. IS THAT -- OF UNDER. GOVERNOR BROWN THERE WAS A FOCUSED ATTEMPT TO BRING A LOT OF THE RESOURCES. THE CENTRAL VALLEY. AND PUSH THAT FORWARD. A LOT OF IT SOME OF IT ALSO BEING CONTINGENT ON FEDERAL FUNDS THAT WERE GOING TO BE MADE AVAILABLE [inaudible] OF INSTEAD OF INSTEAD OF CHALLENGING SOMETHING THAT WILL ALSO GO THERE BECAUSE THE GOVERNOR WILL. PUSH FOR THAT. FOR THAT'S FOR FOR WHAT HE WANTED TO DO ACCOMPLISH -- I THINK I CAN SPEAK FOR MYSELF BUT I'M SURE SOME OF US. HERE'S WHAT WENT ALONG WITH THAT EVEN THOUGH WE WOULD HAVE SEEN. THE FIRST SEGMENT OF THE PROJECT BE IN A DENSER SETTING. WHERE WE COULD DEMONSTRATE THE NUMBERS BASED ON THE USAGE? IF THIS PROJECT STARTED IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. SPECIFICALLY FROM LET'S SAY BAKERSFIELD OR EVEN PALMDALE LANCASTER DOWN. TO LOS ANGELES AN THEN ANAHEIM BURBANK LOS ANGELES AND ANAHEIM BUT THAT TIME BURBANK WASN'T REALLY BEING DISCUSSED BUT BURBANK LOS ANGELES IN ANAHEIM -- THE THE TURN AROUND ON THE LESSENING OF THE IMPACT WOULD BE SO SIGNIFICANT. THAT I THINK THE REST OF THE PROJECT WOULDN'T. HAVE AS MUCH. CHALLENGE. MAYBE IT'S JUST WISHFUL THINKING ON MY PART BUT I THINK WHEN YOU SEE START SEEING THE TRAFFIC. OF WHITE LIGHTS SOUTH HEADED SOUTHBOUND ON THE FIVE FREEWAY STARTING AT ABOUT FOUR THIRTY IN THE MORNING -- IT'S ALSO VERY EASY TO SEE HOW -- HOUSING IS IMPACTED BY TRANSPORTATION. AND TO WHAT EXTENT WE COULD HAVE HIT TWO BIRDS WITH ONE STONE BUT DON'T WANNA. CONTINUE DOING A MONOLOGUE ON THAT. BUT I'M JUST STRESSING THE IMPORTANCE OF I THINK. HOW IMPORTANT IT IS? TO MAKE SURE THAT THE INVESTMENTS AND THE FOCUS IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA -- IS MADE TO THAT EXTENT WHEN. MATCHING FUNDS ARE BEING DISCUSSED. WHAT EXACTLY ABOUT LOCAL MATCHING FUNDS LA HAS PASSED ITS MEASURE THIS SB ONE FUNDING AVAILABLE -- I AM NOT LOOKING AS MATCHING FUNDS. I'M NOT INTERPRETING MATCHING FUNDS TO BE. PRIVATE FUNDS [inaudible] SO PLEASE. THAT THEY COULD BE IF A PRIVATE SECTOR HAVE INTEREST IN THAT PARTICULAR RAIL LINE AND THEY COULD FIND A WAY TO EITHER OPERATOR TO HELP BUILD IT. BUT THE MATCHING FUNDS I MEAN SPECIFICALLY. THERE'S LOTS OF PROJECTS GOING ON BURBANK AIRPORT IS RE. POSITIONING ITS TERMINALS THEY HAVE MONEY FOR THAT WE HAVE PLANS FOR THE BURBANK AIRPORT FOR POTENTIAL STATION THERE. THOSE FUNDS PUT TOGETHER COULD GET THAT DONE AND I DON'T KNOW IN WHAT TIME LINE I DON'T KNOW WITH THE DISCUSSIONS ARE AND I'M WE LET BRIAN DEAL WITH THAT. THAT'S THE CONCEPT OF MATCHING FUNDS WITH BOTH ELEMENTS OR THREE OR FOUR EIGHT ELEMENTS METROLINK HAS COUNTIES HAS ALL KINDS OF MONEY. AND WE COULD CONTRIBUTE IN THE SENSE THAT IT IMPROVES THE ABILITY FOR US TO GET TRACK. HIGH SPEED TRACK OR URBAN HIGH SPEED TRACK. THAT'S THE CONCEPT OF MATCHING FUNDS THAT THAT'S NOT HAPPENED MATCHING FUNDS IN THE VALLEY HAVE HAPPENED AS WITH FEDERAL FUNDS. THERE'S NOT MORE NOW I BELIEVE THERE'S NO MORE MATCHING AT THE LOCAL LEVEL SO THAT'S THAT'S A THAT'S IN QUESTION IT'S IMPORTANT QUESTION. AND I AND I DO THINK AS WE ARE ABLE TO DEMONSTRATE THAT WE CAN DELIVER THERE WILL BE INCREASING INTEREST FROM PRIVATE SECTOR INVESTING BOTH BECAUSE ARE SHOWN WE CAN DELIVER. AND SOME OF THE RISKS OF LOWER WHEN YOU CLEAR THE ENVIRONMENTAL WORK MAKES IT MUCH MORE ATTRACTIVE FOR PRIVATE PARKING PARTICIPATE. AS OPPOSED TO THEY DON'T WANT TO COME IN AND EARLY STAGE WHERE THEY HAVE TO TAKE ALL OF THAT ENVIRONMENTAL RISK. SO WE ARE WE BELIEVE THIS PROJECT OVER TIME. TO BE ABLE TO BE MEETING ITS FULL POTENTIAL WILL REQUIRE. FUNDING PARTNERS FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT EVERY MAJOR INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT HAS AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN UNDER INVESTING IN INFRASTRUCTURE FOR YEARS NOT JUST RAIL. AND IT ALSO REQUIRE. PARTNERS BOTH AT THE LOCAL LEVEL WITH THE END WITH THE PRIVATE SECTOR AND WE FULLY EXPECT THAT THOSE WILL COME AS WE SHOW THAT WE CAN DELIVER. SO GOING BACK TO THE BURBANK AIRPORT THAT'S A WONDERFUL OPPORTUNITY WHAT WHAT CONVERSATIONS HAVE BEEN HAD SO FAR. AND I THINK I SEE MISTER FOR WASHINGTON IN THE AUDIENCE AS WELL SO I DON'T KNOW AT SOME POINT IF HE WAS. GONNA BE SPEAKING TO SOME OF THESE ISSUES AS WELL BECAUSE I THINK THAT WOULD BE A WONDERFUL OPPORTUNITY. TO CONNECTS AND FERNANDO VALLEY TO PASADENA AS WELL. BUT THAT'S A DIFFERENT TOPIC -- WHAT WHAT ARE SOME OF THE THING WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN SOME OF THE CONVERSATIONS THAT HAVE TAKEN PLACE? TO COMPLY I DO NOT KNOW SURE HE HAD NOT TRYING TO BURBANK AIRPORT SPECIFICALLY I DID WANT TO ADD THOUGH THAT -- TERMS AND MATCHING FUNDS -- THE PROP ONE NAY DOES REQUIRE A 50% MATCH -- WONDER ONE MATCH FROM OTHER FUNDING SOURCES SO WHERE BOOK IN FUNDS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO INVEST IN THE CALTRAIN A SYSTEM OR IN UNION STATION. OTHER FUNDS HAVE MATCH THOSE DOLLARS. SO IN CALTRANS CASES OTHER LOCAL FIND SAYS STATE FUNDS THAT HAVE BEEN BROUGHT TO MATCH THE ONE A FUNDS AND THAT'S THE SAME WITH THAT ROSECRANS MARQUARDT PROJECT IN THE LA UNION STATION PROJECT AS WELL SO -- YEAH THAT DOES -- THAT MATCHING IS NOT EXCLUSIVELY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT -- AND AND THAT SAID DEFINITELY A GOOD MODEL -- TO LOOK AT THIS BROADER PARTICIPATION BECAUSE THAT'S REALLY HOW THE BIGGEST PROJECTS GET DONE. IS THROUGH SUCCESSFUL PARTNERSHIPS FEDERAL STATE AND LOCAL. SO WELL WE WILL GET BACK TO ON THE BURBANK I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO TELL OKAY. BUT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT IS VERY. CRITICAL TO ME -- THE BURBANK STATION BURBANK AIRPORT IS JUST OUTSIDE OF MY DISTRICT BUT IT'S A REGIONAL -- FIGHTER AND SO IT'S AND I'VE I'VE I DON'T THINK IN THIS AREA SPEAKING JUST FOR MYSELF BUT FROM HEARING A CORRECTLY FROM. MY COLLEAGUE IN ORANGE COUNTY -- I I CAN'T EXPRESS HOW VALUABLE. THIS INVESTMENT IS GOING TO BE AND TO WHAT EXTENT I THINK YOU HAVE -- PARTNERS HERE THAT ARE WILLING TO HELP PUSH ALONG. ALL CONVERSATIONS AND MAKE SURE THAT THE LOCAL. INVESTMENT OR THE MATCHING AND IF THERE'S MATCHING OPPORTUNITY INVESTMENT IS TAKING PLACE. THAT'S SOMETHING THAT I'D BE HAPPY TO WORK WITH THE ONE YOU WANNA SEE REALIZED [inaudible] THANK YOU. SO WELL TO STIR FINISH UP TO THIS PANEL. BRIAN -- WILL BE IN IN TERMS OF HIGH SPEED RAIL SERVICE IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY REQUIRES STATE SUBSIDY. TO OPERATE. AND IS THAT A VIOLATION OF PROP ONE EIGHTY THE STATE'S OF THE PLANNED PASSENGER TRAIN SERVICE TO BE PROVIDED BY THE AUTHORITY OR PURSUANT TO ITS STORY WILL NOT REQUIRE AN OPERATING SUBSIDY. AND IF YOU COULD JUST FINISH OFF WITH NOW WITH THIS NEW. THOUGHT PROCESS WHEN YOU HAVE ALL OF THESE CONNECTIONS THAT ARE. LA TO MOVE BY BUS TO BAKERSFIELD HIGH SPEED RAIL TUMOR SAID THEN. US THE SAN JOAQUIN. A STEW -- ANOTHER CONNECTION POINT AND THEN CALTRAIN. I'M CERTAIN ACOSTA WRITER. IT IS GOING TO BE AFFORDABLE. WITH ALL OF THESE INCREASED PRICES SURE WELL THIS AT THE MODEL TO HIGH SPEED RAIL SERVICE IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY THIS MODEL THAT THE AMTRAK. COST RATES SO COURSE AT WITH THE CURRENT AMTRAK SERVICE THAT IS THE FIFTH MOST POPULAR AMTRAK SERVICE IN THE COUNTRY. YOU KNOW STILL -- A LOT OF POTENTIAL TO GROW THEIR OF THAT THAT IS A SUCCESSFUL A SERVICE CURRENTLY IF YOU CUT NINETY MINUTES OFF THAT RIDE -- YOU DO SEE BENEFITS SO IN SOME PASSENGERS AS YOU SAY AND MAY CONTINUE TO OTHER SERVICES SOME MAY TRAVEL. BETWEEN MERCED AND BAKERSFIELD. SO IS GONNA BE OUT. OPERATE WITHOUT A SUBSIDY SURE WHEN ON THAT QUESTION IS YOUR NOTING HIGH SPEED RAILS NOT ABLE TO OPERATE THIS SERVICE AND RECEIVE A SUBSIDY -- BUT PROP ONE NAY CONTEMPLATES -- OTHER PASSENGER RAIL -- SERVICES USING HIGH SPEED RAIL INFRASTRUCTURE. AND IT'S WITH THAT THAT THE THE BOOKING FINDINGS WAS WAS CRAFTED -- CALTRAIN FOR EXAMPLE. IN DALY UNION STATION FOR METROLINK AND SURFLINER -- THOSE ARE SERVICES THAT I WILL RECEIVE INVESTMENTS UPGRADES FROM HIGH SPEED RAIL MONEY -- FOR USE FOR OTHER PASSENGER RAIL SERVICES AND ULTIMATELY HIGH SPEED RAIL WILL USE THEM -- THAT'S THE SAME LEGAL STRUCTURE IS IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY -- THESE AS THAT SERVICE -- HIGH SPEED RAIL CAN ALLOW USE BY. THE SAN JOAQUIN SERVICE OR OTHER OPERATORS ULTIMATELY WHEN THAT'S CONNECTED TO THE VOWED TO SAN JOSE -- THAT'S WHERE YOU SEE HIGH SPEED RAIL BEING THE MORE DIRECT OPERATOR IN BEING ABLE TO PROVIDE THAT SERVICE WITHOUT ME FORMS OF THE WAY. IS THE FAREBOX RECOVERY GOING TO BE ABLE TO COVER THE DEBT SERVICE. OF BY THIS PROJECT -- NO I'M ACTUALLY THE THE HENCE YOU WOULD NEED A SUBSIDY. CORRECT YEAH AND IN THE THE OPERATING SUBSIDY REQUIREMENT FOR HIGH SPEED RAIL PROVIDED SERVICE NOT TO COVER THE CONSTRUCTION COST SIXTY CAN. COVER THE OPERATING COST OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE COST. BUT HERE WHEN YOU'RE DURING THE MERCED TO BAKERSFIELD SEGMENT THAT'SNOT A HIGH SPEED RAIL PROVIDED NON OPERATING SUBSIDY SERVICE THAT'S MORE CAN TO THE CALTRAIN OR THE SOUTHERN SERVICES WHERE. THOSE OTHER PASSENGER RAIL SERVICES THEY CURRENTLY RECEIVE OPERATING SUPPORT WOULD CONTINUE TO RECEIVE OPERATING SUPPORT TO PROVIDE THE SERVICE SO I GUESS ONE OF THE THINGS I'D LIKE TO SEE SERENITY. WHAT THE AND YOU -- PERCEIVE THE COST TO BE FOR A TICKET TO RIDE ON THIS PROJECT. AND I THINK THAT'S A FAIR QUESTION -- THE QUESTION FOR YOU BRIAN. TO COMPLETE THE CENTRAL VALLEY LINE THE THIRTY WILL NEED THE REMAINING PROPOSITION ONE A FUNDS. ROUGHLY FOUR POINT ONE BILLION DOLLARS LEFT. NUMEROUS STEPS TO TAKE IN PLACE FOR THAT TO HAPPEN INCLUDING SOME MIDDLE OF FUNDING PLAN. AND PROCREATION BY THE LEGISLATURE. WHEN DOES THE EIGHT FORTY PLANNED TO COME TOWARD A TO THE LEGISLATURE OF WITH THIS REQUEST? I THINK WE'RE STILL EVALUATING THAT THE TIMING OF THAT THE PROJECT UPDATE REPORT INDICATES -- SOMETIME IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND MAYBE THAT THE IT OF STARTING. TO NEED SOME OF THAT THAT CASH -- THAT COULD DOES SLIP PERHAPS INTO TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO IN TERMS OF THE CASH NEEDS -- BUT AS YOU'RE I THINK YOU'RE AS STAFF RIGHT OUT YOU KNOW INDICATES A OF FALL -- TWENTY NINETEEN THAT WOULD THAT BE THE CASE IF THE JANUARY -- BUDGET INCLUDES THAT THE REQUEST BUT AGAIN ON A CASH BASIS -- DON'T APPEAR TO NEED THAT MONEY -- ON THAT TIMELINE THE WILL CONTINUE TO EVALUATE THAT AS THE PROJECT -- PROGRESSES. THANK YOU AND MISTER CHAIRMAN. YOU SEE THE ROLE OF THE AUTHORITY BOARD OF DIRECTORS CHANGING. AND HOW WILL THE BOARD HAVE MORE INDEPENDENCE. AND OVERSIGHT. BECAUSE RIGHT NOW WE HAVE THE STAFF DIRECTING THE BOARD. I'M I BELIEVE THAT THE BOARD HAS HAD INCREASING OVERSIGHT I MENTIONED EARLIER THE EXPANSION OF THE FINANCE AND AUDIT COMMITTEE WITH THE MUCH MORE AGGRESSIVE ROLE IN OVERSEEING IN REVIEWING EACH OF THE INFORMATION IS COMING TO THEM. IT IS STAFF GENERATED REPORTS BUT THERE HAVE ACCESS TO ALL OF THE STAFF MEMBERS TO ASK DETAILED QUESTIONS ON ANYTHING THAT'S TRUE FOR ANY BOARD MEMBER. BUT PARTICULARLY BASS THE FINANCE AND AUDIT COMMITTEE TO DO A THOROUGH SCRUB IN ADVANCE OF THE BOARD MEETING -- ARE ALSO BELIEVE THAT WE ARE AS WE DEMONSTRATE THROUGH THE SETS OF QUESTIONS THAT WE ASK AND THE REPORTS THAT WERE ASKING FOR BOTH FOR THE BOARD MEETINGS WHICH ARE ALL PUBLIC. AS WELL AS WHAT WE MAKE AVAILABLE ON THE WEB SITES. OF THE INFORMATION WE ARE DOING AS BEST WE CAN WITH THE INFORMATION THAT WE FEEL IS NECESSARY TO PROVIDE THAT OVERSIGHT FUNCTION. I ALSO THINK WE WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY IN THOSE MEETINGS AS WELL AS IN THE DISCUSSIONS IN THE QUESTIONS THAT WE ASK INCLUDING WHAT WE ASKED FOR TODAY AS RECOMMENDED BY. THE EARLY TRAIN OPERATOR TO PROVIDE. TO ALSO ASK FOR INDEPENDENT ASSESSMENT OF THE QUALITY OF THE RESULTS THAT ARE BEING DONE SO WE ARE ASKING FOR A FINANCIAL ANALYSIS FOR THE BUSINESS PLAN BOTH WITH THE EARLY TRAIN OPERATOR WHICH IS A WORLD CLASS. BEST IN CLASS TRAIN OPERATOR FROM GERMANY ISSUE NO TORCH UPON AS WELL AS KPMG TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE GETTING AS BEST WE CAN. INDEPENDENT ASSESSMENTS ON THE QUALITY OF THE WORK THAT'S BEING DONE IN A REVIEW OF ALL OF THOSE THAT'S NOT TO SAY WHAT THE BOARD SHOULD BE DOING IS PROVIDING MANAGEMENT THAT'S MANAGEMENT'S ROLE. BUT OUR JOB IS TO BE GOOD GOVERNMENT. AND PROVIDE THAT OVERSIGHT IS AN INDEPENDENT BODY TO DO THAT AS WELL AS REPORT BACK TO THE PUBLIC AND AS APPROPRIATE TO THE LEGISLATURE IN OUR ONGOING UPDATES AROUND ARE WE PROVIDING THE SORT OF SORT OF FIDUCIARY RESPONSIBILITY THAT WE NEED -- TO SO THIS PROJECT UPDATE IS BASICALLY AN UPDATED BUSINESS PLAN -- DID THE PEER REVIEW COME CLOSE COMMITTEE OR THE BOARD HAVE A CHANCE TO WEIGH IN ON THE DRAFT. THE ON THIS. THE BOARD GOT -- PREVIEWS OF ALL OF THIS. AND YOU CAN ASK THE THE PEER REVIEW COMMITTEE WHEN THEY COME UP ABOUT THEIR ENGAGEMENT WITH THAT AND WHEN WE GET TO THE NEXT UPDATE THE BUSINESS PLAN AND TWENTY FIVE NEXT YEAR. AT THAT WILL ABSOLUTELY BE PART OF THE PROCESS EVERYONE WILL HAVE A CHANCE. TO HAVE THEIR INPUT INTO WHAT QUESTIONS NEED TO BE ASKED TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY GET A CHANCE TO ASK THAT IN REVIEW BEFORE BECOMES FORWARD TO THE PUBLIC. SO I JUST HAVE ONE MORE QUESTION. WITH THIS PANEL SO BACK WHEN WE APPROVE THE APPROPRIATION OF THE CAP AND TRADE FUNDS 25%. ONE OF THE SELLING POINTS WAS THE TO PROVIDE CERTAINTY. TO THE PRIVATE SECTOR. FOR INVESTMENT IN THIS AS A PART TRYING TO CREATE A PARTNERSHIP. THIRTY SEVEN COMPANIES WERE APPROACHED THIRTY SEVEN COMPANIES. DECLINED. TO INVEST IN THIS PROJECT. ARE WE CONTINUING THAT PROCESS GOING FORWARD AND WITH OUR EXCUSE OR OF COURSE PEAS OR ANYTHING GOING FORWARD NOW THAT WE HAVE. HE A NEW VISION. THIS BUILDING BLOCK. GOING FORWARD WITH ANY KIND OF I KNOW WE'VE HAD FOR COUNTRY SHOW INTEREST. OF BUT THIS LEGISLATURE WAS SOLD ON THE APPROPRIATION THAT WILL PROVIDE CERTAINTY. FOR A PRIVATE INVESTMENT AND THAT HAS NOT OCCURRED -- SO WHAT EFFORTS ARE BEING DONE [inaudible] TO PROVIDE THAT -- INITIAL. WHAT WE TOLD THE LEGISLATURE WHAT WE'RE GONNA GET FOR THIS? FOR SURE SO FIRST OF ALL THE CAP AND TRADE FUNDS ARE REALLY IMPORTANT PART OF THE FUNDING STREAM AND THAT'S ESSENTIAL TO DELIVERING IT. I'M AS WE MENTIONED EARLIER THEY HAVE BEEN COMING AND LARGER THAN WHAT WE ARE PLANNING ON AND IN THE BUDGET GOING FORWARD WHICH IS. IS HELPFUL -- WE DO AS I SAID BELIEVE THAT THIS PROJECT TO GET TO ITS FULL COMPLETION WILL REQUIRE. A PRIVATE SECTOR INVESTMENT ALONG SIDE THIS AND WE ARE GETTING. INCREASING INTEREST FROM PRIVATE INVESTORS TO SAY THEY WANT TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS WERE NOT AT THE POINT TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THAT REALLY CONCRETE ABOUT WHAT THAT MIGHT LOOK LIKE. BUT CERTAINLY FROM THE BOARD'S PERSPECTIVE AND FROM MY DIRECTION -- WE ARE GOING TO BE EXPLORING THOSE IN AT THE RIGHT. ACE AND TIME WHEN THERE IS A HIGH QUALITY INVESTMENT TO BE MADE THAT I WITH. WITH A STRAIGHT FACE COULD SAY IF I WERE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT TRANSACTION I WOULD FEEL COMFORTABLE THAT THAT'S A GOOD INVESTMENT SO I THINK WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO DELIVER. CLEAR LOWER THE REST TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN BUT IT'S AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE SUCCESS GOING FORWARD. I APPRECIATE THAT AND SO I'M HOLDING IN MY HAND. A GRAPH ABOUT THE BUSINESS PLANS FROM TWO THOUSAND EIGHT TO THE PRESENT [inaudible] AND SO. EACH ONE IS DRAMATICALLY DIFFERENT EACH TIME IT'S BEEN ISSUED. HOW WERE WE ARE SURE THAT THIS PLAN MOVING FORWARD? IS NOT GONNA BE ANY DIFFERENT THAN THE SIX THAT ARE HERE -- WHO'S GONNA BE RESPONSIBLE IF IT DOESN'T HAPPEN [inaudible] AB. I CAN'T SPEAK TO THE PRIOR ONES BECAUSE I WASN'T INVOLVED WITH THEM I DON'T KNOW THE PAGER YOUR SHOWN. BUT YOU KNOW THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR DELIVERY ON THIS PROJECT LIES WITHTHE EXECUTIVE TEAM. AND WITH THE BORDERS OVERSEEING AND ALTERNATELY THE VOTERS AND THE LEGISLATURE WILL HOLD US ACCOUNTABLE TO THAT. SO WE NEED TO DELIVER. I WANTED TO ENSURE THAT THE PLAN REPRESENTS REALISTIC. AND IT'S TRANSPARENT AND SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE COMMITTED TO DEAL WILL BE BACK WITH THAT IN THE TIME FRAME THAT WE COMMITTED TO THE LEGISLATURE. AND IF WE IF THE IT'S NOT DELIVERED THAN THOSE OF US ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR DESERVED TO BE HELD ACCOUNT. YOUR I'VE HAD SOME PRIVATE DISCUSSIONS AND I APPRECIATE YOUR CANDOR AND YOUR WILLINGNESS TO TALK TO ME AND LISTEN. TO OF MY CONCERNS OF AFTER TOURING THE PROJECT A COUPLE TIMES. AND BEING IN THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY FOR THIRTY SEVEN YEARS. OF I REALLY FIRMLY BELIEVE. THEY'RE ALL EFFORTS NEED TO BE MADE. TO CREATE A PARTNERSHIP WITH THE LEGISLATURE -- THAT HASN'T HAPPENED. WE'VE HAD A HAND IN OUR CHEST WE KNOW WE'RE DOING. JUST GIVE US MONEY -- SO I LOOK FORWARD TO THAT. I'M A PROPONENT I UNDERSTAND THE THE IMPACT OF THIS PROJECT WILL CREATE IN CALIFORNIA I TOWARD SPAIN'S HIGH SPEED RAIL. SAW THE DRAMATIC IMPROVEMENT OF THEIR GDP BECAUSE OF THIS -- UNDERSTAND THAT YOU KNOW THIS WAS ABOUT A CONCEPT IN NINETEEN NINETY TWO CHINA THE SAME TIME CHINA HAS SIXTEEN THOUSAND MILES OF HIGH SPEED RAIL NOW -- HOW MUCH WE HAVE? JUST SAYING SO [inaudible] AGAIN. I I I I NEED TO SEE EFFORTS ON COST SAVINGS TO EVERY TIME I SEE A BUSINESS PLAN COME OUT. THE THE COST GETS MORE MORE MORE I THINK DESIGN THE DESIGN ELEMENT HAS TO CHANGE AND UNDERSTAND THAT WE NEED TO DO. MORE WITH LESS. GOING FORWARD IS JUST IT'S IMPERATIVE. AND SO I LOOK FOR TO HEAR YOUR SUCCESS I THINK TO THE RIGHT GUY TO TO MOVE THIS FORWARD WITH JOE. I THINK THIS TEAM IS A AND BRIAN AND THE OTHER BRANDS. I THINK WE'RE GONNA BE ABLE. TO GET THE BALL ROLLING BUT MY EXPECTATION IS THAT. YOU KNOW PAST. PERFORMANCES BEEN DISMAL. AND MY EXPECTATION IS. I'M PUTTING THIS ON MY CALENDAR WHAT WAS TOLD TO HAPPEN TO ME. IN THIS IN THIS. SEGMENT HERE. AND WILL HAVE A DISCUSSION WHEN WHEN WE GO FORWARD BUT I LOOK FOR TO POSITIVE UPDATES. TO SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR YOUR PARTICIPATION TODAY AND WE LOOK [inaudible] FOR TO SUCCESS. PANEL NUMBER. TWO HELLO CHRISTINE HOW THE FIRST PRINCIPLE FISCAL POLICY YET ANALYSIS -- WITH THE LEGISLATIVE AND ANALYSIS OFFICE ELLIE OKAY AND LEWIS'S THOMPSON THE CHAIR OF THE HIGH SPEED RAIL PEER REVIEW GROUP -- I RELY ON HEALTH ONLY. HELLO ONCE YOU GO HEAD START. THANK YOU SO MUCH CHAIR -- GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS TELLING CRISTINA THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE I THE SURGEONS ARE PASSING OUT OF HAND THAT WHICH YOU SHOULD ALSO HAVE IN YOUR PACKETS AS WELL -- THAT ACCOMPANIES MY REMARKS TODAY IT PROVIDES A BRIEF BACKGROUND ON THE PROJECT IT SUMMARIZES THE PROJECT AT THE REPORT AND IT ALSO IDENTIFIES SOME ISSUES FOR LEGISLATIVE CONSIDERATION. HI SO GIVEN THE COMMITTEES EXTENSIVE KNOWLEDGE ON THIS ISSUE AND ALSO -- IN THE INTEREST OF TIME I'M GOING TO SKIP AHEAD -- TO PAGE SEVEN WHERE -- WE QUICKLY HIGHLIGHTING THE MAJOR ISSUE MAJOR FEATURES AT THE TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN PROJECT UPDATE REPORT I'LL GO PRETTY QUICKLY BECAUSE I THINK MANY OF THESE WERE TOUCHED ON BY PREVIOUS SPEAKERS BUT JUST WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT A FEW THINGS -- SO THE FIRST THING AS WAS MENTIONED EXTENSIVELY IS THAT THIS PROJECT UPDATE REPORT SORT OF REFOCUSES THE PROJECTS ON MERCED TO BAKERSFIELD -- AND ANTICIPATES OF LAUNCHING EARLY INTERIM SERVICES ON THAT SEGMENT. HI THIS IS REALLY DRIVEN BY A COUPLE OF FACTORS FIRST IS THE ANALYSIS DONE BY THE EARLY TRAIN OPERATOR WE HEARD A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT -- SO THE EARLY TRAIN OPERATOR WAS -- WAS TASKED BY THE AUTHORITY WITH FOCUSING ON REALLY TWO DIFFERENT SEGMENTS LOOKING AT THE SAN FRANCISCO TO GILROY SEGMENT AND WERE SAID TO BAKERSFIELD -- THE EARLY TRAIN OPERATOR MADE A VARIETY OF KEY ASSUMPTIONS AND ITS ANALYSIS FOR EXAMPLE IT MADE SOME ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT OTHER CAPITAL PROJECTS OTHER TRANSPORTATION CAPITAL PROJECTS OCCURRING ALSO -- IT MADE SOME ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT SEAMLESS INTEGRATION WITH OTHER TRANSPORTATION PROVIDERS ON BOTH REAL PROVIDERS AS WELL AS BY SERVICES -- AND IT ALSO ASSUMES THE TERMINATION OF THE EXISTING -- COMPETING SAN JOAQUIN SERVICE OUT THAT MERCED. SO GIVEN THESE ASSUMPTIONS THE EARLY TRAIN OPERATOR CONCLUDED THAT THE MERCED TO BAKERSFIELD LINE WOULD BE THE PREFERRED OPTION OVER THE SAN FRANCISCO TO GILROY SEGMENT. US A SECOND -- BASICALLY THIS -- DECISION TO FOCUS ON WERE SAID TO BAKERSFIELD WAS INFORMED BY THE REVISED COST ESTIMATES SO THE TWO THOUSAND AND NINETEEN PROJECT UPDATE REPORT -- REFLECTS AN INCREASE OF ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS IN THE COST OF THE INITIAL CONSTRUCTION SEGMENT TO A TOTAL OF TWELVE POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS. AS YOU HEARD FROM THE AUTHORITY THIS IS DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY AN INCREASE IN THERE CAN ESTIMATES FOR CONTINGENCIES. SO ONE THING I JUST WANTED TO MAKE URE WAS CLEARING A THERE'S SOME DISCUSSION ON THE P. TEN AND P. -- SEVENTY BUT I JUST WANTED TO TO ALSO HIGHLIGHT THAT AGAIN BECAUSE I THINK IT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT POINT. THAT'S WHAT THE AUTHORITY SAYS IS THE MAIN DRIVER BEHIND THIS COST INCREASE SO ESSENTIALLY PREVIOUSLY WHAT THEY WERE DOING IS SETTING THEIR BASELINE COST ESTIMATE. SUCH THAT THERE IS A 90% CHANCE THAT BASED ON THEIR MODELING THE PROJECT WOULD GO OVER THAT BASED ON COST ESTIMATE. US THAT WAS A PRETTY AGGRESSIVE. APPROACH AND NOW THEY'RE TAKING WHAT THEY CONSIDER TO BE A MORE OF AN INDUSTRY STANDARD APPROACH FOR THAT MERCED TO BAKERSFIELD MINE. AND THEY'RE TAKING WHAT THEY WHAT THEY CALL A P. SEVENTY ESTIMATES THEY'RE SETTING THE BASELINE COST ESTIMATES SUCH THAT THERE IS A 30% CHANCE THAT THEY'LL GO OVER BUDGET RATHER THAN A 90% CHANCE -- SO THEY'RE DOING THAT WITH THAT MERCED TO BAKERSFIELD SEGMENT. pREVISE THE COST ESTIMATES FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE PROJECT THESE BEYOND MERCED TO BAKERSFIELD. THE PROJECT UPDATE REPORT ALSO IDENTIFIES FUNDING FROM A VARIETY OF SURF SOURCES AS WAS AS WAS MENTIONED INCLUDING PROPOSITION ONE A BOND FUNDS FEDERAL FUNDS AND CAP AND TRADE REVENUE THROUGH. TWENTY THIRTY IN TOTAL THE AUTHORITY ESTIMATES THAT IT WILL HAVE A TOTAL OF TWENTY POINT. FIVE BETWEEN TWENTY POINT FIVE IN TWENTY THREE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS FROM THOSE SOURCES AT THREE TWENTY THIRTY THE AUTHORITY ALSO ESTIMATES THAT THE COST OF BOTH CONSTRUCTING THAT WERE SAID TO BASE BAKERSFIELD SEGMENT AS WELL AS THE OTHER COMMITMENTS THAT THE AUTHORITY HAS -- HAS MADE INCLUDING A THE ENVIRONMENTAL WORK FOR ALL OF PHASE ONE AND THOSE BACK IN PROJECTS THAT WE HEARD ABOUT. ON THAT THAT WOULD TOTAL ABOUT TWENTY POINT FOUR BILLION SO THAT THEY'LL HAVE -- SUFFICIENT FUNDING TO COMPLETE THAT. IF YOU TURN TO PAGE NINE THERE'S A TABLE THAT THAT SUMMARIZES BOTH THE FUNDING THAT THEY BELIEVE IS AVAILABLE AS WELL AS THE COSTS THAT ARE ESTIMATED AS OF THIS POINTS. FOR THAT MERCED TO BAKERSFIELD MINE. US SO WE ALSO NOTE THAT THE PROJECT AT THE REPORT ASSUMES THE AVAILABILITY FOR OF ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR THE COMPLETION OF PHASE ONE BUT DOESN'T IDENTIFY SPECIFIC FUNDING. IF YOU TURN TO PAGE TEN WE HIGHLIGHT SOME ISSUES FOR LEGISLATIVE CONSIDERATION AND THAT REALLY FLOW FROM THOSE MAJOR FEATURES OF THE PROJECT AFTER REPORT THAT I HIGHLIGHTED PREVIOUSLY. I SO FIRST WE NOTE THAT THE SUCCESS OF THAT INTERIM SERVICE IS REALLY GONNA DEPEND VERY HEAVILY ON A VARIETY OF FACTORS SO AS I MENTIONED THE EARLY TRAIN OPERATORS ASSUMPTIONS. OR ANALYSIS WAS REALLY PROMISED ONLINE A VARIETY OF THINGS HAPPENING IN TERMS OF CAPITAL PROJECTS IN TERMS OF OTHER OPERATIONS. I'M TO THE EXTENT THOSE THINGS DON'T HAPPEN ARE THE RIDERSHIP THE REVENUE ESTIMATES THAT ARE -- CURRENTLY EXPECTED MAY NOT MATERIALIZE SO WE WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT THAT. SECOND WE WANTED TO NOTE THAT THE ACTUAL PROJECT COSTS COULD BE HIGHER THAN ARE CURRENTLY ANTICIPATED. PART OF THAT IS AS WE KNOW THIS IS A VERY LARGE PROJECT IT'S HAD ITS HAD PASSED COST INCREASES -- IT WOULDN'T BE SURPRISING AT ALL IF IT HAS FUTURE COST INCREASES PART OF THIS IS JUST YOU KNOW. THESE KIND OF PROJECTS DO YOU FROM TIME TO TIME HOWEVER THERE SOME SPECIFIC ASPECT OF THIS PROJECT THAT I THINK -- RAISE THE LIKELIHOOD OF POTENTIAL COST INCREASES ONE IS SCHEDULING SLIPS WHICH MAY WELL HAPPEN PARTICULARLY GIVEN ALL THE ISSUES WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT WERE ENCOUNTERING -- AND THAT WOULD NATURALLY PROBABLY HAVE RAISE SOME COST PRESSURES SO THAT'S ONE THING TO NOTE -- BUT ALSO JUST THIS AS IF THAT THE SCALE OF THIS PROJECT I AM FINALLY I JUST WANTED TO KIND OF COME BACK TO THAT P. SEVENTY P. TEN I KNOW IT'S A LITTLE BIT -- TECHNICAL OF AN ISSUE BUT AS I MENTIONED IN THE EARLIER THEY REVISED THEIR METHODOLOGY FOR THAT MERCED TO BAKERSFIELD SEGMENT BUT NOT FOR THE ENTIRE PROJECT. SO THEY'RE STILL USING THAT P. TEN APPROACH WHICH IS A MORE AGGRESSIVE BUDGETING APPROACH FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE PROJECT AND SO THAT PROBABLY RAISES THE LIKELIHOOD THAT THERE COULD BE. ADDITIONAL COST INCREASES FOR THE PROJECT. THE THIRD ONE IS TO NOTE THAT IT'S UNCLEAR IF THERE'S GONNA BE SUFFICIENT FUNDING TO COMPLETE MERCED TO BAKERSFIELD. US SO AS WAS NOTED THE CURRENT ESTIMATE IS THAT THERE WILL BE SUFFICIENT FUNDING BUT AS WE HEARD ALSO THERE'S UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THE FEDERAL FUNDS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS -- HAS TAKEN ACTION TO TRY TO RESCIND THAT ROUGHLY ONE BILLION DOLLAR PORTION THEY'VE ALSO THREATENS THE OTHER TWO POINT FIVE BILLION SO THERE'S SOME CHANCE THAT THE STATE WILL LOSE SOME OR ALL OF THOSE FEDERAL FUNDS. ADDITIONALLY CAP AND TRADE IS YOU KNOW BY ITS NATURE SOMEWHAT UNCERTAIN SO IT'S UNCLEAR WHETHER REVENUES WILL COME IN AS PROJECTED FOR THAT FUND SOURCE. AND OF COURSE IF COSTS INCREASE FOR THE PROJECT THAT COULD ALSO MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT TO HIM TO FULLY FUNDS WHAT -- IS IS CURRENTLY ENVISIONED WITHIN THE FUNDING AVAILABLE. IF YOU TURN TO PAGE -- ELEVEN WE ALSO AND ALSO HIGHLIGHT THAT THERE'S NO FUNDING PLAN BEYOND MERCED TO BAKERSFIELD. SO REALLY THE BULK OF THE COST OF THE PROJECT ARE BEYOND MERCED TO BAKERSFIELD AS ARE THE SORT OF MOST COMPLEX ENGINEERING COMPONENTS OF THE PROJECT. AT THIS TIME IT'S UNCLEAR HOW THE STATE WOULD FUND THAT -- IT SEEMS LIKELY THAT THE STATE WOULD PROBABLY HAVE TO FIND MUCH OF THAT FROM THE GENERAL FUND IF IT'S TO COMPLETE THIS PRACTICE PROJECT AT THIS POINT -- IN LESS MOTHER FUNDING TO REALIZES -- FIFTH JUST WANTED TO ALSO HIGHLIGHT THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS ADDITIONAL OPTIONS IN THIS WAS MENTIONED BY PREVIOUS SPEAKERS AS WELL BUT I THINK IT REALLY BEARS REPEATING THIS IS AN ARGUE OF IT REALLY -- GOOD TIME TO LEGISLATURE TO STEP BACK AND THINK ABOUT THE OPTIONS THAT MIGHT WANT TO PERCEIVE GOING FORWARD THE ADMINISTRATION'S SIGNALING A LITTLE BIT OF A CHANGE IN APPROACH WE HAVE THIS BIG FUNDING GAP -- REALLY I THINK IT'S A GOOD TIME TO TO STEP BACK AND THINK ABOUT WHAT OPTION SHOULD BE PURSUED. I NEED TO NOTE THAT REALLY THE MERCED TO BAKERSFIELD -- OPTION IS NOT THE ONLY ONE ON THE TABLE IT'S NOT THE ONLY ONE THAT'S THAT'S OUT THERE THE LEGISLATURE COULD THINK ABOUT DOING A SMALLER SEGMENT OR LARGER SEGMENT AND THAT. THE LEGISLATURE COULD COMMIT TO THE HIGH SPEED RAIL AND REALLY -- PURSUE THAT OR COULD LOOK AT OTHER KINDS OF PURCHASE BOTH ON AN INTERIM BASIS OR POTENTIALLY ON A LONG TERM BASIS SO REALLY -- THEY'RE PROBABLY A VARIETY OF OPTIONS THAT ARE THAT ARE OUT THERE -- IF YOU TURN TO PAGE TWELVE WE HIGHLIGHT SOME QUESTIONS THAT THE LEGISLATURE MAY WISH TO ASK AS ITS EXPLORING THOSE DIFFERENT OPTIONS -- THE FIRST IS COST SO THAT'S GOING TO BE A CRITICAL PIECE OF ANY KIND OF DECISION. I THE INITIAL CONSTRUCTION SEGMENTS THE TWELVE POINT FOUR BILLION CURRENT ESTIMATE -- THOSE WERE SAD AND BAKERSFIELD EXTENSIONS ARE CURRENTLY ESTIMATED. TO ADD TWO POINT FIVE BILLION OR ONE POINT FOUR BILLION RESPECTIVELY -- SO THAT THOSE ARE GONNA BE TRADE -- FOR THOSE COSTS -- OR EVEN EXTENDING IT FURTHER FOR EXAMPLE. I NEXT TRANSPORTATION BENEFITS I THINK A REALLY IMPORTANT THING FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER IS WHAT ARE THE TRANSPORTATION BENEFITS PROVIDED BY EACH DIFFERENT OPTION AND HOW DO THEY COMPARE -- ESPECIALLY. YOU KNOW CAN ONSIDERING OTHER ALTERNATIVE USES OF THE FUNDS AND I KNOW THAT SOME OF THE QUESTIONS PREVIOUSLY WERE GETTING AT THAT. ON FOR EXAMPLE IN TERMS OF RIDERSHIP ON HOW MUCH DOES YOU TO DO THESE OPTIONS ARE PROVIDE IN TERMS OF RIDERSHIP BENEFITS VERSUS OTHER OPTIONS PER PERHAPS IN SOME OF THE MORE POPULATED AREAS OF THE STATE. I THE NEXT ISSUE TO CONSIDER IS THE EFFECTS ON LOCAL COMMUNITIES AND THOSE BOTH ARE THINGS LIKE CONSTRUCTION IMPACTS BECAUSE IT CAN BE VERY DESTRUCTIVE TO COMMUNITIES TO HAVE THIS KIND OF COULD -- CONSTRUCTION BUT ALSO THE ECONOMIC BENEFITS OF HAVING THESE JOBS IN AND WE HEARD A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT AS WELL. AND THEN FINALLY MAJOR RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES ARE VERY CRITICAL HERE WE'VE ALSO I KNOW THE COMMITTEE IS VERY FAMILIAR WITH MANY OF THESE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES BUT CERTAINLY THERE'S CONSTRUCTION COST INCREASED RISK. BUT IS ALSO RISK ASSOCIATED WITH OUR COMPLIANCE WITH PROPOSITION ONE A AS WELL AS THE FEDERAL REQUIREMENT SO THOSE ARE ALL THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT. ARE THE LEGISLATURE'S GONNA HAVE TO KEEP IN MIND. WE THINK AS IT'S REVIEWING POSSIBLE OPTIONS. FOR MOVING FORWARD WITH THE PROJECT. THANK YOU FOR THAT. WHO? GOT IT MISTER CHAIRMAN FIRST I THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE TODAY -- I'VE HAD THE PLEASURE WORKING WITH YOU OVER A IN A NUMBER OF YEARS NOW AND AND I HOPE IT'S BEEN USEFUL. I ALSO WANT TO SAY THAT IT'S BEEN A PLEASURE WORKING WITH YOUR STAFF THEY HAVE DONE EXTREMELY PROFESSIONAL WORK PREPARING FOR THESE HEARINGS -- AND I CAN SEE THE VALUE OF THESE PROCEEDINGS OVER A PERIOD OF TIME I WOULD ALSO SAY THAT I HATE TESTIFYING AFTER THE LA -- BECAUSE I NOT SURE WHAT I HAVE TO ADD THAT I MY TENDENCY IS TO SAY WHAT SHE SAID AND THEN DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS BUT I'M NOT GOING TO DO THAT AT LEAST I WILL SUMMARIZE THIS. THERE HAVE SO FAR BEEN SEVEN BUSINESS PLANS BEGINNING IN TWO THOUSAND AND ENDING THUS FAR IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN BUT WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT TODAY IS ALMOST A REVISED TWENTY EIGHTEEN BUSINESS PLAN. OR TWENTY NINETEEN OVER THIS TIME THE PROJECT HAS EVOLVED FROM A PROJECT THAT WAS GONNA SERVE SAN FRANCISCO LOS ANGELES SAN DIEGO IN SACRAMENTO WITH HIGH SPEED RAIL. THE ONE WHICH NOW ONLY PROPOSES TO COMPLETE THE CENTRAL VALLEY SECTION ADDING -- MERCED AND BAKER SEAL. THIS EVOLUTION THAT WE HAVE WATCHED HAS BEEN DRIVEN INEXORABLY BY ADJUSTMENTS NEEDED TO RESPOND TO THREE DIFFERENT FORCES. ONE CONTINUALLY INCREASING CONSTRUCTION COSTS AS THEY'VE INQUIRED ACTUAL EXPERIENCE. SECOND REDUCTIONS IN THE ESTIMATES OF MONEY THAT THEY HAD -- CREDIBLY COULD HAVE. AND THIS IS WITH THE PROJECT AND HAS BEEN UNDERFUNDED SINCE THE BEGINNING. AND FINALLY THE IMPACT OF THE FRA GRANTS OF THAT SPECIFIED THAT THE WORK WOULD BEGIN IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. IN VERY BROAD TERMS TO THE PROJECT UPDATE REPORT PER FOR OF RESPONDS BY SAYING THAT THE GOVERNOR. OF IS COMMITTED TO AN OVERALL VISION OF COMPLETING THIS SYSTEM BUT HE WANTS TO SEE THE SNOW CENTRAL VALLEY SECTION. COMPLETED FIRST IN ORDER TO DEVELOP IMMEDIATE BENEFITS TO DEMONSTRATE FEASIBILITY. AND TO DEMONSTRATE MANAGEMENT CONFIDENCE I THINK THIS WOULD BE CRITICAL IF THEY CAN DO THAT. THEY ARGUE THAT THE UTILITY A CENTRAL VALLEY SECTION CAN BE SIGNIFICANTLY ENHANCED BY ADDING THE LINKS TO MERCED AND THE BAKERS FEEL. THEY STATE THAT THE AUTHORITY WILL BE ABLE TO COMPLETE ALL THE ENVIRONMENTAL WORK FOR PHASE ONE AS IT'S BEEN PROMISED TO THE F. R. A.. IN NETWORK WILL CONTRIBUTE TO A BETTER ESTIMATE OF THE COST OF THINGS LIKE THE JAYCO TUNNELING FOR EXAMPLE. THE HIGH SPEED RAIL EXTENSION TO MERCED -- IN CONNECTION WITH SAN JOAQUIN WILL BE GOOD FOR ALL OF THE SERVICES OF THE PROJECT AS WE'VE DISCUSSED EARLIER THAT IT WOULD INCREASE THE DEMAND FOR ALL. THREE IN RESULT IN A TOTAL REDUCTION TO THE STATE OF ABOUT TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY IN THE SUBSIDY FOR ALL THREE SERVICES -- IT IS NOT CLEAR WITH THE SPEED RAIL SERVICE PER SE WILL OPERATE AT A DEFICIT BUT THEY ARGUED THAT THE THE SOME OF THE THREE WILL LOSE THIRTY MINUTE OF TWENTY MILLION LESS. A CRITICAL ASSERTION IS THAT THE CENTRAL VALLEY SECTION INCLUDING THE ADDED LINKS FOR SEVEN BAKERSFIELD CAN BE FINANCED WITHIN EXISTING RESOURCES. I WANT TO EMPHASIZE TO YOU THAT THIS PROPOSAL IS BASED ON THE NUMBER OF US ASSUMPTIONS DISCUSSED IN THE PROJECT -- PLAY A REPORT THAT WE HAVE GOT TO BE. OUT ON THE TABLE. ONE IS IT THE STATE WILL RETAIN THE TWO AND A HALF BILLION ERA MONEY AND THE NINE HUNDRED TWENTY NINE MILLION. IN THE FY TWO OH TEN APPROPRIATION WHICH IF ALREADY HAS NOW FORMALLY DE OBLIGATED. THE SECOND IS IT THE RECEIPTS FROM CAP AND TRADE NEED TO AVERAGE AT LEAST FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY. EVEN THEN IF THE RECEIPTS ONLY AVERAGE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION THERE WOULD BE A TEMPORARY GAP OF ABOUT ONE POINT FOUR BILLION TO GET TO THE END OF THE PROJECT. RECEIPTS WOULD HAVE TO BE CONSIDERABLY HIGHER A TO AVOID THE NEED FOR BRIDGE FINANCING OR TO TRY TO MAKE UP FOR THE LOSS OF THE NINE HUNDRED TWENTY NINE MILLION IF THAT IS. IS FINAL. THE PROPOSAL TO GENERATE OPERATING REVENUES FROM THE SALE OF CARBON CREDITS IS NEW AND NOVEL I'VE NOT SEEN THIS BEFORE IN EFFECT IT PUTS THE HIGH SPEED RAIL. AUTHORITY IN THE IN THE POSITION OF GETTING 25% OF THE RECEIPTS FROM THE SALE OF THE CREDITS AND AT THE SAME TIME HAVING OPERATING AGENCY THAT SELLING THE CREDITS. I DON'T KNOW THAT THIS IS WRONG OR RIGHT BUT I'VE NOT SEEN THIS BEFORE. NEXT THE CONSTRUCTION COST HAVE TO FALL WITHIN CURRENT ESTIMATES WIN ONE THERE IS NO EXPERIENCE WITH ELECTRIFICATION SIGNALING TRACKWORK ROLLING STOCK AND SHOPS. INTO THE ESTIMATES THE NUMBER SAID THE MADERA AND SHELLFISH AFTER TO BAKERSFIELD LINKS AROUND FOUR BILLION DOLLARS. OR AT A VERY EARLY STAGE OF DESIGN. FINALLY THE PROPOSED LANGUAGE WITH ACE IN SAN JOAQUIN SERVICES CAN BE ESTABLISH AN OPERATOR THIS PLAN WHEN IN FACT THESE PLANS ARE OR FOR PRELIMINARY AT BEST. AND IT ALSO ASSUMES THAT THE IDEA OF HAVING ANOTHER AGENCY ASSUME THE OPERATING OFFICES IN ORDER TO AVOID PROPOSITION ONE A LITIGATION ASSUMES THAT WILL PASS MUSTER. FOR THESE REASONS WE CONCLUDE THAT THE PROPOSAL IS SUBJECT TO A WIDE RANGE OF UNCERTAINTY WITH AN ADVERSE OUTCOME AT ALMOST ANY POINT CAUSING FURTHER PROBLEMS FOR THE PROJECT. INCLUDING LEGAL DELAYS AND POTENTIALLY A NEED FOR FURTHER FINANCE. AS DISCUSSED IN OUR EARLIER LETTERS IN TESTIMONY EARLIER THIS YEAR THE LEGISLATURE DOES HAVE OPTIONS I DON'T WANNA GO THROUGH THESE IN GREAT DETAIL WE ALREADY HAVE BUT YOU COULD JUST STOP. PAY THE CLAIMS AND WALK AWAY. I DON'T THINK THIS ANYONE THINKS THIS IS A CREDIBLE OPTION BECAUSE YOU'D LOSE ALL THE VALUE OF THIS CREATED. YOU COULD DO THE MINIMUM TO KEEP THEIR OWN MONEY COMPLETE THE EXISTING CONTRACTS USE IT FOR LOWER SPEED OPERATION AND THEN STOP. MAKING A SHORT CONNECTION WITH THE SAN JOAQUIN ROUTE AT MADERA AND IT CHAPTER WOULD PERMIT USE OF THE HIGH SPEED RAIL ALIGNMENT FOR SLOWER TRAINS. IT WOULD SAVE THE BEFORE BILLION DOLLARS EXTRA TO MAKE THE HIGH SPEED CONNECTIONS. AND IT WOULD SAVE THE COST OF ELECTRIFICATION WHICH IS AROUND A BILLION DOLLARS AND THE COST OF HIGH SPEED ROLLING STOCK WHICH IS AROUND SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. THIS WOULD BE A DISAPPOINTING CHOICE IN WOULD CLEARLY NOT MAKE THE BEST USE OF THE WORKTHAT'S BEEN DONE SO FAR BUT IT IS A VALID CHOICE. YOU COULD ADOPT THE THE PROPOSAL AS IN THE PROJECT UPDATE REPORT MAKING THE ADDED CONNECTIONS MERCED IN BAKERSFIELD USE HIGH SPEED ROLLING STOCK AND RE ROUTE THIS AND LIKE TEAMS. IF THE LEGISLATURE UPS TO APPROVE THIS HOWEVER IT SHOULD REQUIRE A MORE DETAILED AND AGREED OPERATING PLAN FOR THE SYSTEM INCLUDING THE INTERACTIONS WITH ACE IN THE SAN JOAQUIN'S. IN ADDITION SINCE DECISIONS TO GO BEYOND THE CENTRAL VALLEY WILL BE DEFERRED THE LEGISLATURE MAY WANT TO REQUIRE THE AUTHORITY TO UNDERTAKE A THOROUGH VALUE ENGINEERING ANALYSIS OF THE OF THIRTIES MAJOR COST DRIVERS FOR THE FUTURE. ESPECIALLY THE TUNNELING CONTACTS WHICH OF THE LARGEST SINGLE UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THE REMAINING CONSTRUCTION AND THE PROJECT OR YOU COULD REMIT READ JUST RECOMMIT TO FACE. ONE THIS WOULD REASSURE BOTH THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIANS IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA JUST AT THE PROJECT WILL REACH THEM EVENTUALLY. BUT IT WOULD HAVE TO BE ACCOMPANIED BY A CREDIBLE FINANCING SOURCE. IN ASSESSING THESE OPTIONS THERE APPEARED TO BE SEVERAL STEPS THAT REALLY OUGHT TO BE DONE ONE IS TO CLARIFY THE ACTUAL COMMITMENT TO THE ERROR TO GET THE ERROR OF MONEY. IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THIS ONLY INVOLVES CREATING A RAILROAD TRACK BASICALLY FROM MADERA IT TO SCHEFTER THAT'S ALL. DOESN'T REQUIRE ELECTRIFICATION DOESN'T REQUIRE SIGNALING A FOR HIGH SPEED IT DOES REQUIRE ROLLING STOCK ONLY BUILDING A RAILROAD LINE FROM ONE TO THE OTHER. BUT IT'S DANGEROUS TO RELY ON MY LEGAL OPINIONS THIS SHOULD BE -- VERIFIED. SECOND YOU SHOULD OBTAIN FROM THE AUTHORITY THEIR OPINION AS TO THE IMPLICATIONS OF PROP. ONE EIGHTY VIS A VIS ANY OF THESE DECISIONS. AS DISCUSSED THE INTERIM OPERATION OF THE CENTRAL VALLEY LINE WILL INVOLVE OPERATING DEFICITS IN THIS MIGHT CLASH WITH THE REQUIREMENT OR PROP UP WHEN A THE PROHIBITS AN OPERATING SUBSIDY. THAT'S THIS GOOD BEE. SUBSIDY COULD BE CARRIED BY ANOTHER AGENCY. IN ADDITION A DECISION TO LIMIT THE LINE TO CONVENTIONAL SPEED FOR MADERA DISH AFTER IN THE INTERIM. MIGHT CLASH WITH THE SPEED AND TRIP TIME REQUIREMENTS OF PROPOSITION ONE A SO WE NEED TO KNOW WHAT'S WHAT'S THE STORY HERE. I WAS I WAS VERY HAPPY TO HEAR MISTER MADONNA AND DANCES SAY EARLIER. THAT I THINK YOU NEED A MUCH MORE COMPLETE REPORT ON THE INTERCONNECTIONS WITH ACE IN THE SAN JOAQUIN SERVICE HOUSES GOING TO WORK WHO'S GONNA DO WHAT. WHAT KIND WITH THE CUP WITH THE COST WITH THE DEMANDS WOOD OF THE OVERALL PLAN SO IT SHOULD BE MADE FOR THIS? AND I THINK THAT THE STATE AND ITS STATE REAL PLAN SHOULD ALSO BE COMMITTED INVOLVED AND COMMITTED IN THE ANALYSIS OF THE RESULTS OF THAT YOU HAVE A BETTER IDEA. WHAT WILL REALLY HAPPEN IF THE LINE IS OPERATED THE WAY IT IS PROPOSED? ALSO WE NEED TO ASSESS THE IMPACT OF THE F. FOR A POSITION OF SIMPLY WALKING AWAY FROM THE ENVIRONMENTAL WORK AS A FORMER. FRA EMPLOYEE I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS I DON'T KNOW. HOW THIS CAN CONTINUE BUT I CERTAINLY DON'T KNOW WHAT THE WORK AROUND PLAN IS? IN CASE IT REMAINS THIS WAY AND YET I THINK WE NEED TO KNOW THAT OR THINK ABOUT THAT BECAUSE THERE IS A POSSIBILITY THAT IT COULD STOP EVERYTHING. AND I DON'T KNOW HOW TO DEAL WITH. OVERALL THE PROJECT UPDATE REPORT IS CERTAINLY A STEP BUT IT'S ONLY A STEP AND CLARIFYING WHAT THE AUTHORITY MAY BE ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH. A LOT MORE WORK NEEDS TO BE DONE TO RESOLVE UNCERTAINTIES IN MENTIONED INCLUDING THE OPERATING PLAN BUT ALSO THE UNCERTAINTIES AROUND A LOT OF THE PROJECTED COSTS. ALL LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT AND GUIDANCE IS REALLY NEEDED TO TAKE SOME OF THE FOG OUT OF THEIR FUTURE. IT IS REALLY HARD TO MANAGER PROJECT WHEN YOUR FUTURE IS UNCERTAIN AND ANYTHING THE LEGISLATURE CAN DO. HOWEVER IT MOVES TO CLARIFY THE FUTURE IN MAY AND BRING SOME DEFINITION I THINK WOULD BE VERY IMPORTANT. THANK YOU FIFTH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH LUKE -- STE VOLUME THE QUESTIONS OF THE SPELL. THE NUMBER -- FOUR MR GREAT [inaudible] UP. I APOLOGIZE I I JUST THOUGHT OF ONE WHEN I HAD WHO'S GONNA LET THIS -- DILISIO ACTUALLY BUT I THINK YOU GAVE IT DID MISTER TIMES YOU GIVE AN INTERVIEW TO THEM. NEWS AWHILE BACK. ABOUT THE FUTURE WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE AND THAT WE NEEDED TO KIND OF GET A MORE CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT -- HAS TO AUTHORITIES PLANS FOR THE FUTURE DO YOU EVER THAT INTERVIEW I YES IT WAS ABOUT A ONE HOUR INTERVIEW FROM WHICH THEY CAREFULLY SELECTED ABOUT A MINUTE AND A HALF THE MEDIA ALWAYS AS A RIGHT. WELL MAYBE YOU CAN KIND OF SUMMARIZE THAN WHAT YOU REALLY MEANT TO SAY ARE MADE WAS IT TAKEN OUT OF CONTEXT OR I THINK YOU YOU YOU HAD THERE'S A SPECIFIC QUOTE AND I DON'T HAVE IN FRONT OF ME SO I APOLOGIZE. ABOUT JUST TRYING TO KIND OF GET A CLEAR COMMITMENT FROM NICE TO AUTHORITY I JUST WHAT THEY'RE TRYING TO DO IN THE FUTURE IF THE IF THAT BY SUMMATION WAS IS. IS INCORRECT PLEASE LET ME KNOW. I WOULD BE AFRAID TO SAY IT BUT I WILL ANYWAY I THINK THE MAIN POINT I WANTED TO MAKE WAS THAT THAT. SOMETHING SOME ACTION NEEDS TO BE TAKEN THE THAT SOME DIRECTION FROM THE LEGISLATURE THAT SAYS DO THIS OR DO THIS OR FORM OF FORMER AND AGREED PLAN. IS REALLY CRUCIAL NOW -- AND THEN THE THROWAWAY REMARK THAT THEY CHOSE TO QUOTE BUT I BECAUSE IT MAKES PEOPLE NERVOUS IS. IT'S NOT THAT HARD TO FIND WHATEVER IT IS YOU WANT TO DO THE QUESTION IS POLITICAL WILL IT IS NOT A QUESTION OF SOURCES OF FINANCING. AND SO I THINK THE BOTTOM LINE IT'S REALLY CRUCIAL THAT THE LEGISLATURE NOW HELP THE AUTHORITY AND THE GOVERNOR DO SOMETHING. CLARIFIED AND DECIDE ON IT AND THEN STAND BEHIND IT I I I I THINK THE CRUCIAL PROBLEM THAT THIS PROJECT IS HAD FROM THE BEGINNING IS THAT IT WAS. NOT CREATED BY THE LEGISLATURE AND IT WAS NOT CLEARED BY THE LEGISLATURE IT WAS CREATED IN A SORT OF WISHFUL THINKING -- PROPOSITION AND WHICH SHOULD BE THE VISION WAS HERE IN THE BUDGET WAS HERE. AND THEY WERE NOT BROUGHT TOGETHER IN A MEANINGFUL WAY. NOW THEY NEED TO BE. M. I APPRECIATE THAT AND AND MY LAST QUESTION AND IT WAS FOR BOTH IS THE IT WAS SINCE SINCE YOU TESTIFIED LAST WEEK. A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT HAPPENED ON THE ON THE FEDERAL LEVEL THEN I APOLOGIZE FOR NOT BEING A FOR YOUR ENTIRE PRESENTATION. BUT MAYBE BOTH YOU CAN CAN KIND OF SHARE -- AND NOW BEING FORWARD WITH EVERYTHING AND THAT HAS COME FROM -- THAT HAS OCCURRED WITH NOW THAT THE CALIFORNIA SUING RESEARCH LIKE CARRIER SUING OR THE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT -- DOES IT PUT. THE UPDATE IN A NEW LIGHT I MEAN IT IS THERE NOW JUST MORE UNCERTAINTY. IS THERE IS IS IS THE UPDATE NOW A CREDIBLE DOCUMENT NOW KNOWING MORE INFORMATION FOR WHAT HAPPENED FROM THE LAST WEEK. SO IT SEEMS THAT IT DOES -- ADDED AN EXTRA LAYER OF CHALLENGE CERTAINLY TO THE AUTHORITY ANYTIME THERE'S LESS MONEY AVAILABLE THAT'S THAT'S NOT A GOOD THING FOR THE PROJECT -- FUNDAMENTALLY A BILLION DOLLARS PROBABLY IN THE CONTEXT OF THE WHOLE PROJECT IS YOU KNOW THAT'S NOT -- THAT'S NOT I STAYED PARTICULARLY HIGH PERCENTAGE OF EIGHT TO COST OF THE ENTIRE PROJECT BECAUSE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A PROJECT THAT'S PROBABLY AT LEAST SEVENTY NINE BILLION DOLLARS IF YOU LOOK AT ALL OF THESE ONE NOW -- BUT CERTAINLY EVERY BILLION DOLLARS I MEAN THAT'S THAT'S SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF MONEY AND THAT'S MONEY THAT COULD GO TO OTHER KINDS OF PRIORITIES IS LEGISLATURE'S VERY INTERESTED AND SO. I THINK IT'S IT'S YOU KNOW NOT GOOD FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IT'S NOT GOOD FOR THE PROJECT -- AND I THINK IT IS ME YOU KNOW MAYBE ONE WHEN YOU KNOW EXTRA REASON WHY IT'S IT'S WORTH A SORT OF HAVING THIS CONVERSATION ABOUT -- WE WHAT IS THE LEGISLATURE'S VISION FOR THE PROJECT HOW MUCH MONEY ON DOES THE STATE WANT TO COMMIT -- TO THIS PROJECT GIVEN GIVEN UNCERTAINTIES AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL -- I HAVE TO QUOTE. SENATOR EVERETT MCKINLEY DIRKSEN WHO SAID ONCE A BILLION DOLLARS HERE BILLION DOLLARS THERE PRETTY SOON YOU'VE GOT REAL MONEY -- IT DOES ADD TO THE UNCERTAINTIES THAT'S FOR SURE -- BUT IT MAY NOT BE THE GREATEST UNCERTAINTY ALL OF THESE STATE COSTS IN THE THE POTENTIAL SCHEDULES AND THE RETENTION OF FEDERAL MONEY -- THERE ALSO OBJECT. TO AS WE SAID A WIDE RANGE OF UNCERTAINTY -- AND I THINK THAT THAT IT CERTAINLY. COULD WORK OUT. FAVORABLY -- BUT IT MIGHT NOT AND I THINK THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD BE PREPARED AND THINK ABOUT NINE ONLY. HOPING FOR THE BEST FOR PLANNING FOR THE WORST WHAT DO WE DO IF THERE ARE PROBLEMS WITH FURTHER PROBLEMS WITH THE COST -- BUT TO SCHEDULE OR OR WITH THROUGH THE SCOPE OF THE PROJECT AND HOW DO WE HANDLE THIS PROBLEM MISTER FRAZIER STARTED OFF BY SAYING THIS COULD BE A ROUGH RIDE WE SHOULD BE AWARE OF IT. I I APPRECIATE THE THE CHAIRMAN'S PATIENTS AND I I AGREE WITH THIS CHAMBERS ELSE'S AND YOURS IT'S IT'S THAT. HOLISTICALLY STAKING A STEP BACK. THE BILLION DOLLARS IS ONE THING BUT THEN YOU ADD AND EVERYTHING ELSE WITH THE THE ER'S IN THE POTENTIAL FUTURE COSTS OF A RUNS AND THE NEED FOR MORE PROFESSIONAL APPROVALS AND RIDERSHIP -- RIDERSHIP -- CHALLENGES AND ALL THOSE THINGS IS A WE CAN'T LOOK AT EVERYTHING THROUGH A SILO -- TO A STRAW WE NEED TO LOOK AT IT FOR WITH WITH KIND OF A THREE THOUSAND FOOT LEVEL SO I APPRECIATE YOUR ANALYSIS AND AND CANDOR THINK INSTRUMENT. THANK YOU MISTER FONG HELEN -- AS THE FUNDING PLAN RELIES HEAVILY ON THE FUTURE CAP AND TRADE REVENUES. HOW CONFIDENT ARE YOU IN THE ESTIMATES CLOTHING IN THIS PLAN BASED ON -- THERE'S A PUSH TO ACTUALLY INCREASE THE COST OF THE AUCTION. A PER METRIC TON. AND THE WILLINGNESS OF INDUSTRY TO ACTUALLY ACCEPT THAT. SO CERTAINLY THE ESTIMATES THAT THEY PUT FORWARD SEEM REASONABLE AT THIS POINT HOWEVER I THINK OUR OFFICES NOTED. THERE IS JUST UNCERTAINTY WITH REGARD TO CAP AND TRADE REVENUES AND I THINK YOU HIGHLIGHTED ONE ASPECT OF UNCERTAINTY BUT THEY'RE PROBABLY A VARIETY OF OF THINGS THAT ARE MAKING THOSE REVENUES ON CERTAIN AND SO. I THINK THAT'S ONE CHALLENGED THE AUTHORITY FACES IS THAT IT'S CURRENTLY RELYING ON A SOURCE OF REVENUE -- BADTHAT IS SUBJECT TO THAT UNCERTAINTY AND AND IS ALSO ONLY APPROVE THREE TWENTY THIRTY SO -- THAT'S CERTAINLY A CHALLENGE AND I THINK NO ONE CAN BE COMPLETELY CONFIDENT IN THOSE NUMBERS JUST BECAUSE OF THAT IN HERE AND UNCERTAINTY. THANK YOU I HAVE ONE MORE QUESTION FOR YOU. HI IT IS THE ONLY -- HAVE ANY RECOMMENDATIONS FOR ADDITIONAL OVERSIGHT MEASURES THAT COULD BE TAKEN -- BY THE LEGISLATURE OR THE ADMINISTRATION THE AUTHORITY. SO WE HAVEN'T COME UP WITH SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS IN THAT AREA BUT I WOULD SAY JUST A COUPLE OF THINGS MAYBE FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER I THINK HEARING SUCH AS THIS ONE ARE REALLY IMPORTANT FOR OVERSIGHT AND SO. REALLY APPRECIATE THE COMMITTEE PUTTING THIS HEARING ON I THINK THIS IS BEEN VERY VERY VALUABLE AND I THINK THIS TYPE OF ACTIVITY IS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT PART -- ALSO I TARGETED REPORTING CAN BE REALLY HELPFUL THERE THAT ALREADY PROVIDES A NUMBER OF REPORTS ON SOMETIMES I THINK THE CHALLENGES TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT. ARE THERE IN A WAY THAT THE LEGISLATURE CAN REALLY DIGEST I KNOW THEY'VE MADE SOME EFFORTS AND NOT IN THAT REGARD AND I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY STILL SOMETHING THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO WORK TOWARDS I KNOW MISTER THOMPSON'S ALSO BEEN VERY VERY INVOLVED IN THAT -- I THINK THAT'S ANOTHER CRITICAL PIECE THAT HELPS THE LEGISLATURE CONDUCT ITS OVERSIGHT ROLE -- I JUST A COUPLE OTHER THINGS POTENTIALLY TO THINK ABOUT THOUGH I THINK AS WE MOVE FORWARD ONE IS SORT OF THE FUNDING STRUCTURE FOR THE PROJECT SO A LOT OF THE FUNDING AS WE MENTIONED -- PREVIOUSLY IS CONTINUOUSLY APPROPRIATED CAP AND TRADE FUNDS -- OUR OFFICE IS NOTED IN THE PAST THAT CONTINUES APPROPRIATIONS DON'T GIVE THE LEGISLATURE QUITE AS MUCH OVERSIGHT IS A TRADITIONAL KIND OF APPROPRIATIONS SO THERE'S A TRADE OFF THEIR YOU KNOW IF IT WERE. DONE IN ANOTHER MANNER THAT WE GIVE PERHAPS A LITTLE BIT MORE OVERSIGHT TO THE BUDGET PROCESS WHICH CAN BE A VALUABLE TOOL FOR THE LEGISLATURE -- AND THEN ANOTHER THING JUST TO TO THINK ABOUT IS SORT OF THE GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE I KNOW THIS IS SOMETHING THAT DAY -- YOU OF ALSO THOUGHT ABOUT ASSEMBLY MEMBER BUT THE GOVERNMENT STRUCTURE AND WHETHER THAT'S PROVIDING SUFFICIENT -- OVERSIGHT FROM THE LEGISLATURE'S PERSPECTIVE WE HAVEN'T DONE AYE AYE AND IN DEPTH ANALYSIS OF THAT BUT I THINK THAT'S YOU KNOW THERE'S A CERTAIN AMOUNT THE LEGISLATURE CAN DO BUT SOMETIMES IT'S HELPFUL TO HAVE THESE OTHER ENTITIES LIKE THAT LIKE THE BOARD. LIKE THE PEER REVIEW GROUP -- PROVIDING ANOTHER LAYER OF OVERSIGHT AND SO I THINK REALLY THINKING THROUGH ARE WE GETTING THE LEVEL OF OVERSIGHT WE NEED FROM THOSE ENTITIES AND IF NOT WHAT SPECIFIC ACTIVITIES AND WHAT WE WANT THEM TO DO IN A DIFFERENT WAY OR OR HOW IT HAS TO BE THING ABOUT THE STRUCTURE. SO WE HAVEN'T THOUGHT ABOUT THE DETAILS OF THAT BUT CERTAINLY THINK THOSE ARE THE KINDS OF BY THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT SHOULD BE EXPLORED MORE IN CONSIDERED MORE AS A LEGISLATURE MOVES FORWARD AND TRIES TO GRAPPLE WITH HOW TO GET OVERSIGHT OVER. A VERY COMPLEX VERY COSTLY A DYNAMIC PROJECTS SUCH AS THIS. ONE MISTER CHAIRMAN A AS YOU KNOW WE'VE WE'VE DISCUSSED THIS ISSUE OF OVERSIGHT AND A NUMBER OF REPORTS THAT WE'VE HAD BUT BECAUSE OF WHAT. WE THINK IT IS SO IMPORTANT THERE THERE REALLY ARE THREE ISSUES ONE IS THE LOCATION OF THE OVERSIGHT AGENCY SO YOU CAN BE SURE. THAT THEY'RE INDEPENDENT. THE OTHER THE SECOND IS ADVOCACY IF YOU DON'T HAVE ADEQUATE RESOURCES YOU HAVE NO HOPE OF DEALING WITH THE PROGRAM THIS LARGE. THE THIRD ONE AND I STRESS THIS IS CONTINUITY -- IT IS THERE IS A REAL DANGER TO HAVE OF HAVING OVERSIGHT OF HAVING STAFF CHANGES EVERY YEAR AND IF YOU HAVEN'T BEEN THERE LONG ENOUGH TO REMEMBER WHAT YOU WERE TOLD TWO YEARS AGO AND THERE'S NO WAY YOU CAN KEEP UP WITH THE CHANGES. SO OF THERE WOULD BE A ANY ONE OF A NUMBER OF WAYS YOU COULD DO THIS ONE WE HAVE OFTEN SUGGESTED IS SPECIAL UNIT IN LA -- WITH THE RIGHT RESOURCES IN CONTINUITY DO IT. BUT ONE WAY OR THE OTHER YOU IF YOU YOU NEED TO PROVIDE ALL THREE OF THOSE ELEMENTS IF IF YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE REALLY GOOD PROFESSIONAL OVERSIGHT AND ADVICE TO YOU AND WHAT YOU'RE DOING. I APPRECIATE THAT SO THAT SAID WAS INTO YOUR QUESTIONS WITH -- I KNOW YOU'RE GOING TO SCHOOL HERE. WHO WAS A PEER REVIEW GROUP CONSULTED ON THE NEW CENTRAL VALLEY LINE PLAN ON RIDERSHIP ESTIMATES? COST ESTIMATES AND THEN FARE COSTS. ARE A MEMBER OF THE PEER REVIEW GROUP STACEY MORTENSEN WAS INVOLVED IN THOSE DISCUSSIONS I I WILL DEFER TO HER. BECAUSE SHE WILL BE APPEARING IN A MINUTE ON THAT OKAY WAS INVOLVED IN THIS DISCUSSION MY PREVIOUS. HELLO HOW CONFIDENT ARE YOU ABOUT THE EACH HEROES OF FORTY COST ESTIMATES FOR THE CENTRAL VALLEY. ALL RIGHTS I DO I THINK WE SORT OF DEALT WITH THAT BY SAYING IT NEEDS A LOT MORE WORK I I'M NOT SAYING THEY'RE WRONG I JUST THINK THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF DETAILS THAT NEED TO BE WORKED OUT A LOT OF MORE QUESTIONS THAT HAVE TO BE. ASKED IN THIS CONTEXT -- BEFORE WE CAN BE CONFIDENT THAT THE NUMBERS ARE TELLING US WHAT WE NEED TO HEAR. I APPRECIATE THAT I THINK WHEN WE HAD THE HEARING WITH THE STATE ORDER OF GO BACK A YEAR NOW FOR TWO YEARS YOUR BILL A SMALL. A ONE OF THE QUESTIONS I ASKED OF THE AUDITOR IS THE MANAGEMENT TEAM QUALIFIED FOR THIS PROJECT DO WE HAVE CERTAINTY THAT WE KNOW. OF THAT -- EVERYBODY IN THERE HAS ACTUALLY. OF THE ABILITY. TO MANAGE THESE CONSULTANTS AND THE AND THE AND THIS THE SUBCONTRACTORS GOING FORWARD. HAVE YOU HAD ANY OPPORTUNITY SAYS SENT TO LOOK AT THAT A QUESTION. ME THINK ABOUT HOW TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION. UP I THINK THERE IS NO QUESTION BUT WHAT THEY HAVE [inaudible] COMPETENT [inaudible] FASHIONABLE PEOPLE. WHO CAN MANAGE THIS JOB I THINK THE QUESTION IS? HOW SOON DO THEY LEARN EXACTLY WHAT THE PROBLEMS ARE AND HOW TO PUT THE PROCEDURES IN PLACE TO MANAGE THE PROJECT? I THINK THAT HAS THAT WAS A PROBLEM AT THE BEGINNING BECAUSE THEY STARTED WITH WITH TWO OR THREE STATE EMPLOYEES IN TWO OR THREE HUNDRED CONSULTANTS AND THAT IS NO WAY TO RUN A PROJECT LIKE THIS. I THINK THE PROPOSAL'S NOW TO SHIFT THAT BALANCE MORE TOWARDS STATE EMPLOYEES WHO HAVE AUTHORITY TO RIVER WORK FOR THE STATE AND I THINK THE FACT THAT THEY'VE GAINED EXPERIENCE OFTEN PAINFULLY BUT THEY'VE GAINED EXPERIENCE IN THE WE'RE GETTING A LOT CLOSER TO HAVING. AN ORGANIZATION IN PLACE THAT CAN BEGIN TO HANDLE THESE FROM -- SO IT'S IT'S ALWAYS A QUESTION OF YOU CAN ALWAYS FIND THE PEOPLE THE QUESTION IS HOW DO YOU PULL IT TOGETHER AND HOW DO YOU GIVEN THE RIGHT. RESOURCES IN INCENTIVES TO MANAGE THE PROJECT PROPERLY INSIDE SAY THEY'RE GETTING CLOSER. THANK YOU FOR THAT. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OF THE COMMITTEE OF THE SPELL. WELL LUIS HELP HELLO I GOT IT THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BRINGING TO LIGHT A YOUR PERSPECTIVE AND AND ANOTHER VIEW POINT FOR THE COMMITTEE AND ALSO THE LEGISLATURE WE DO DEPEND ON YOU -- WITHOUT YOUR INSIDE AN INVALUABLE EXPERTISE GOING FOR WE WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS SO I APPRECIATE YOUR HARD WORK. AND A LOOK FORWARD TO THE FUTURE WHILE WORKING TOGETHER ON THIS PROJECT. TO THANK YOU FOR BEING THANK YOU. WE MOVE UNDER THE THIRD PANEL -- STAYS MORTENSEN EXEC DIRECTOR SAN JOAQUIN REGIONAL REAL COMMISSION. AND MISTER FILL PORTION TO CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF LOS ANGELES COUNTY. METROPOLITAN TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY AND JIM PARTNER THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF CALTRAIN. ONE OF THE STATE SEE WHAT A CHIU STORES OFF. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE THANK YOU. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AND MY HONOR JUST LOUD ENOUGH. BUT IF ITS LINEUP GOT IT. WELL I AND MY TEAM HAVE MANAGED A SERVICE SINCE ITS INCEPTION AND WE RECENTLY BEGAN MANAGING THE SAN JOAQUIN'S IN TWENTY SIXTEEN SO WE DO HAVE QUITE A BIT OF EXPERIENCE WITH THE TWO SERVICES THAT WERE MENTIONED. THAT IS LIEU SAID I WAS APPOINTED TO THE PEER REVIEW GROUP IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE IN LIEU HAS TUTORED ME AND HOW TO DO CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM. AND SO I THINK WE'VE HAD A A GOOD DOSE OF THAT. OUR AGENCY HAS BEEN PLANNING ON A PASSENGER RAIL HUB FERBER SAID SINCE THE MID NINETEEN NINETIES SO LONG BEFORE HIGH SPEED RAIL. THIS REALLY ON THE SCENE AND ON THE MAP IN TERMS OF THEIR PROGRAM OR SAID WAS VERY IMPORTANT TO THEM THE VALLEY COUNTY IS THAT WE'RE WORKING ON EXPANDING RAIL SERVICE. WITH THE APPROVAL OF PROP ONE A THOUGH AMBER SAID STATION IN PHASE ONE OF THE HIGH SPEED RAIL PROGRAM MADE THAT A MORE CRITICAL HUB. IN OUR MINDS AND IN OUR PLANNING. AS HAS BEEN MENTIONED ABOUT SOME AB BOUNCING BALLS OF THE BUSINESS PLANTS THE MERCED STATION AS BOUNCED IN AND OUT OF IT AND WE HAVE RALLIED TO TRY TO SUPPORT MERCED AND WE'VE AGREED TO SUPPORT GOING TO SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WHEN THAT SEEM TO BE IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE STATE. BUT OUR CLOSE WORKING GROUP IN THE VALLEY OF COUNTIES WOULD NEVER FALTERED IN MAKING OUR PROGRESS. TOWARDS ENHANCING PASSENGER RAIL TO MERCED. WE ARE ALREADY IN THE PLANNING PROCESS AND ENGINEERING PROCESS OF PHASING NEW SERVICE DOWN TO MERCED FROM THE EXISTING A STRUGGLING. HOWEVER THE POTENTIAL ARRIVAL OF AN IN THE INITIAL SEGMENT OF HIGH SPEED RAIL SERVICE. CREATES A NEW INTEGRATION THAT WILL INCREASE RIDERSHIP ON NUMEROUS CONNECTING SERVICES AS WELL AS THE HIGH SPEED RAIL SEGMENT. THE AUTHORITY DID DISCUSS WITH US THE MERCED CONNECTION IN ADVANCE OF RELEASING THAT PROJECT UPDATE REPORT. AND THEY SUGGESTED THERE'S VARIOUS SCENARIOS -- THE SERVICE AREAS WE CAN ANALYZE TOGETHER TO MAXIMIZE THE ATTRACTIVENESS TO THE TRAVELER ACROSS ALL OF THE SYSTEMS AND SO I THINK THE OPERATIVE PHRASE THERE WAS SOME FUTURE ANALYSIS TO REALLY TRY TO PUT THE PIECES TOGETHER. IN MY DIFFERENT ROLES I SEE A MODEL NEEDED NOT THE OLD ONE NOT THE ONE THAT IS TEAMS NOT CAPABLE OF OF LOOKING AT AT THE NEW SERVICE SCENARIOS I THINK WE NEED A NEW MODEL WE NEED TO INVEST IN AND NEW MODEL. AND I WOULD ARGUE WE NEED TO SIMULTANEOUSLY. WHAT TRAVEL TIME OPTIONS ARE AVAILABLE WHAT DIFFERENT CLASSES OF ON BOARD SERVICE IS AVAILABLE? WHAT ARE THE TRAIN SPEEDS DO WE HAVE REGULAR STOP AND EXPRESS SERVICE WHAT ARE THE FARE LEVELS WHAT ARE THE -- OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH DIFFERENT TRAIN SPEEDS. THE ROUTE IS BEING BUILT TO PROP ONE A STANDARDS AND CAPABLE OF SUSTAINING TWO HUNDRED MILE AN HOUR TRAINS. BUT THERE'S LIKELY A DIFFERENT SWEET SPOT. THAT WE CAN FIND THAT WOULD DIAL IN THE SERVICE CHARACTERISTICS IN THE MOST SUSTAINABLE WAY FOR A RAMP UP PERIOD AND MY UNDERSTANDING. THROUGH OTHER SYSTEMS AND EVEN THROUGH THIS PROCESS WAS THAT THERE WAS ALWAYS A RAMP UP PERIOD TO TEST OUT WHAT'S THE BEST SPEED TO RUN OUT. WHAT'S THE BEST SERVICE CHARACTERISTICS TO ACHIEVE THAT -- NON SUBSIDY. RAIL SCENARIO. THE SEAMLESS PROSPER CROSS PLATFORM TRANSFER IN MERCED AND THE ONE SI RIDE THAT LETS YOU GET TO SACRAMENTO OAKLAND AND SAN JOSE. NEED TO BE BUILT INTO THE MODEL TO REALLY CAPTURE THE FULL RIDERSHIP POTENTIAL. IN THE EXISTING MODEL DOESN'T HAVE THE CAPABILITY TO ANALYZE THOSE IMPORTANT MULTI DIMENSIONAL FACTORS. I AM VERY BRIEF TODAY BECAUSE I'M REALLY HEAR MORE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS THAT THERE MIGHT BE ABOUT THE CONNECTION BETWEEN HIGH SPEED RAIL IN THE TO CONVENTIONAL SERVICES. I THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE I LOOK FORWARD TO ITMY PARTNERS AND COLLEAGUES ARE ARE GOING TO SAY AND WOULD BE HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- MISSED WASHINGTON. YES OF THANK YOU AND GOOD AFTERNOON NOMS GERMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE -- THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK BEFORE YOU TODAY -- LA METRO HAS LONG SUPPORTED THE CALIFORNIA HIGH SPEED RAIL PROJECT -- WE'RE HERE TO COMMUNICATE -- OUR PROGRESS AND CONTINUE PARTNERSHIP WITH THE STATE -- WE WOULD LIKE TO EXPRESS OUR GRATITUDE. TO GOVERNOR NEWSOME AND HIS ADMINISTRATION FOR WORKING WITH US WE WORK VERY CLOSELY -- WITH -- HIGH SPEED RAIL MISTER BRIAN ANISSA MISTER BRIAN KELLY AS WELL -- TODAY I'D LIKE TO FOCUS ON HOW WE'RE USING THE HIGH SPEED RAIL. OF FUNDS TO PROVIDE REAL BENEFITS TO COMMUTERS IN OUR REGION AND HOW WE CAN USE -- THOSE FUTURE INVESTMENTS -- TAMPAX TRANSPORTATION BOTH AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA LA COUNTY AND STATE WIDE. AS ALL OF YOU ARE WELL AWARE OF THE HIGH SPEED RAIL TWENTY EIGHTEEN BUSINESS PLAN INCLUDES. FUNDING FOR THE BOOK IN INVESTMENTS THAT HAS BEEN TALKED ABOUT -- THIS COMMITTEE THIS AFTERNOON -- IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA -- AND THEY ARE THE ROSECRANS MORE COURT A GRADE SEPARATION AND LINK. UNION STATION PROJECTS -- WITH THE ROLES CRANS MORE CORD GREAT SEPARATION PROJECT MATCH ROLE -- AND THE HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY HAVE PARTNERED WITH -- BURLINGTON NORTHERN OR BNSF RAILROAD AND THE CITY. OF SANTA FE SPRINGS TO ELIMINATE -- THE MOST DANGEROUS GRADE SEPARATION IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. OF THE ROSECRANS MORE COURT GRADE CROSSING HAS LONG BEEN RATED -- AS THE MOST DANGEROUS RAIL. ROAD CROSSING IN CALIFORNIA -- LOCATED IN THE CITY OF SANTA FE SPRINGS -- THIS AT GRADE CROSSING OF ROSECRANS MORE CORDON ROSECRANS AVENUE I SHOULD SAY AMARCORD AVENUE. HAS A HUNDRED AND TWELVE METROLINK AMTRAK AND FREIGHT TRAINS EVERY WEEK WE DAY. OF THE CROSSING IS ALSO LOCATED AT ONE OF THE KEY LOGISTICS HUBS FOR GOODS MOVEMENT IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA -- WITH APPROXIMATELY FORTY THOUSAND VEHICLES ACROSS THIS INTERSECTION EVERY DAY. THROUGH OUR PARTNERSHIP WITH THE HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY AND THE CITY OF SANTA FE SPRINGS WE ARE ABLE TO ELIMINATE -- THIS CROSSING BY BUILDING A GRADE SEPARATION EXPANDING TRACKS AND INCREASE THE FREQUENCY OF COMMUTER AND FREIGHT TRAFFIC IN THE AREA. WE NOW HAVE WILL FORCE THE OPPORTUNITY. TO FURTHER PUT THESE FUNDS TO USE BY INVESTING AND THE LOS ANGELES UNION STATION -- THE LOS ANGELES SCENES STATION IS THE LARGEST MULTI MODAL TRANSIT TERMINAL IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA -- AS THE OTHER A HIGH SPEED RAIL BOOK IN PROJECT. OF THE LOS ANGELENOS STATIONS SERVERS OVER CURRENTLY SERVES OVER ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE PER WORK DAY -- FROM LA METROS LIGHT RAIL SYSTEM AND SUBWAY SYSTEM -- THE METRO BUSES -- OTHER MUNY BUSES AN AMTRAK -- INTER SERVICE BUSES AND APPROXIMATELY A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY TWO METROLINK AN AMTRAK TRAINS PER DAY -- HOWEVER THE COMMUTER RAIL TRAIN TRACKS A UNION STATION OUR STUFF INDEED WHICH MEANS ALL TRAINS ENTER AND EXIT. IN THE NORTH IN OF THE STATION -- THE LINK UNION STATION PROJECT WILL TRANSFORM HOW REGIONAL RAIL SYSTEM. OPERATES IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WITH RUN THROUGH TRACK CAPABILITY -- WHICH MEANS METROLINK AND AMTRAK TRAINS CAN PROVIDE ONE SEEK RIDES. AT UNION STATION FROM VENTURA COUNTY TO SAN DIEGO COUNTY TO CONNECT WITH METRO BUSES -- AND RAIL SYSTEM IN ADDITION IT WILL ACCOMMODATE THE FUTURE HIGH SPEED RAIL SYSTEM. UP WITH TONS OF ACTIVITY IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA IN THE NEXT TEN YEARS -- STARTING WITH THE SUPERBOWL ACTUALLY AND TWENTY TWENTY TWO OF THE WORLD CUP IN TWENTY TWENTY FOUR AND OF COURSE THE OLYMPICS IN. TWENTY TWENTY EIGHT WE ANTICIPATE -- SERVING -- APPROXIMATELY. TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND PASSENGERS AT LA UNION STATION IN THE COMING YEARS SO THESE IMPROVEMENTS THAT I JUST DESCRIBED -- WOULD CREATE SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITIES FOR REGIONAL MOBILITY AND IS THE KEY FIRST STEP -- IN OUR LARGER PLANS TO CREATE A WORLD CLASS TRANSIT TERMINAL STATION. THESE PROJECTS ARE LEVERAGING A STATE INVESTMENT OF FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS TO INCREASE CAPACITY. IMPROVE OPERATIONS REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND ACCOMMODATE A NEW HIGH SPEED RAIL SYSTEM. HOWEVER WITH A TOTAL POPULATION OF APPROXIMATELY THIRTEEN MILLION PEOPLE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WE NEED MORE -- HIGH SPEED RAIL INVESTMENTS -- THAT WILL PROVIDE IMMEDIATE BENEFITS TO REGIONAL RAIL MOBILITY AND REDUCE TRAFFIC. CONGESTION -- WHILE PROVIDING AN OPPORTUNITY TO ACCOMMODATE A HIGH SPEED RAIL SYSTEM IN THE FUTURE -- MISTER CHAIRMAN I DO HAVE A VIDEO THAT SHOWS THESE TWO INVESTMENTS THERE ABOUT ONE MINUTE EACH. A WILL YOU INDULGE ME OR I WILL OKAY -- I'M GONNA ASK. SOMEONE TO COME UP. AND HIT THE RIGHT BUTTON FOR ME. ON THE DESKTOP OKAY. DO YOU KNOW WHICH ONE IS CALLED. ROSECRANS MARK COURT. STATION. MUCH OF COMPUTER -- SOME OF THESE YEAH. SOME OF THOSE [inaudible] TWENTY ROSECRANS WITH THAT ONE YEAH THAT'S THE FIRST ONE AND THEN -- ROSECRANS AND MCCARTY RATED TRANSACTION HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED AS ONE OF THE MOST HAZARDOUS CROSSINGS CALIFORNIA. OVER ONE HUNDRED AND TWELVE FORTY FIVE THOUSAND VEHICLES BECAUSE THIS INTERSECTION DALY. EACH WEEK THE CROSSING ARMS ARE DOWN FOR A COMBINED. TWENTY ONE SPRINT'S BUT CARD. FOR ASIAN PROJECT WILL SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE SAFETY. BY SEPARATING PEDESTRIANS BICYCLISTS AND VEHICLES FROM FOUR TYPES OF TRAINS PASSED OVER ONE HUNDRED THIS [inaudible] FEATURED. THIS WILL GREATLY REDUCE TRAFFIC CONGESTION ELIMINATE DELAYS. ABILITY REGION'S GREENHOUSE GAS MAYBE I'LL. AND WAS CHAIR ONE MORE I THINK IS A MINUTE AND A HALF. ROSECRANS AND MCCARTY THIS STATION. LOS ANGELES REGION [inaudible] TODAY [inaudible] STATION CENTRAL THIS [inaudible] JEEZ THIS IS STATION [inaudible] STATION -- SO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR OF THESE TWO PROJECTS AS I MENTIONED EARLIER -- HIGH SPEED RAIL -- INVESTMENTS -- ARE COMMITTED TO IT AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO RECEIVING THOSE FUNDS -- AND WHICH IS VERY VERY CENTRAL TO OF COURSE HIGH SPEED RAIL BUT ALSO -- TO THE METRO LINK SYSTEM -- THE METRO SYSTEM AS WELL -- AND THE PLAN THAT WE HAVE FOR THAT SENSUAL UP SO THANK YOU SO MUCH I LOOK FORWARD. TO THE QUESTION THANK YOU VERY MUCH I CAN'T SEE YOUR LAST NAME FOR OUR NEXT PRESENTER. UNDERSTAND YOURSELF JIM HART NET THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR IS A PLEASURE TO BE HERE I CAN'T TOP THE VIDEO OR THE INSIGHTS OF OF MISS MORRISON -- AND I'D I'D LIKE TO BE LESS ON DETAIL AND MORE ON A CHARACTERIZATION FIRST I'D REALLY LIKE TO TALK ABOUT. PROBLEMS ON FALL -- GIANT TO PINCH HITTER FIRST BASEMAN THIRD BASEMAN WHO HAS A A CONTRACT WITH THE GIANTS THAT DOESN'T COST THE GIANTS VERY MUCH. BUT HE'S HITTING HOME RUNS WHEN YOU REALLY NEED IT. AND I THINK -- HIGH SPEED RAILS INVESTMENT IS A FUNDING PARTNER IN THE ELECTRIFICATION FOR CALTRAIN. TOGETHER WITH THE OTHER FUNDS WITH ACCUMULATED INCLUDING SIX HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. IS A HOME RUN SO HOME RUN FOR HIGH SPEED RAIL. IS A HOME RUN FOR CALTRAIN BECAUSE OF THE LACK FOR CATION PROJECT CALTRAIN IS THE HAS GROWN TO BE THE SEVENTH LARGEST COMMUTER RAIL SYSTEM. IN THE COUNTRY -- WE ON THE RIGHT AWAY FROM SAN FRANCISCO TO SAN JOSE AND WE USE A UNION PACIFIC RIGHT AWAY FROM SAN JOSE TO GILROY UNDER AT LIMITED TRACKAGE RIGHTS AGREEMENT. SINCE THE EARLY TWO THOUSANDS WHO WE'VE ALMOST TRIPLED IN RIDERSHIP -- BUT THE ELECTRIFICATION PROJECT HAS BEEN A DREAM OF THE CALTRAIN SYSTEM SINCE THE EARLY NINETEEN NINETIES. BUT IT'S NOT UNTIL THAT HOME RUN WAS HIT THAT WE COULD ACTUALLY DO IT THAT IS THE OF PUTTING TOGETHER OF THE ACCUMULATION OF FUNDING SOURCES INCLUDING THE IT CRITICAL INVESTMENT FROM. HIGH SPEED RAIL -- TO PUT TOGETHER THE BUDGET TO ALLOW US TO ELECTRIFY TO BECOME A CLEAN SYSTEM. A MORE EFFICIENT SYSTEM -- A BETTER SYSTEM ON IN TERMS OF ITS OPERATING CHARACTERISTICS IN A SYSTEM THAT IS GOING -- TO ALLOW US TO INCREASE OUR RIDERSHIP IT'S THE BASE OF THE GROWTH OF OUR SYSTEM WE EXPECT THAT BY TWENTY FORTY WE MAY. IN A POSITION TO CAPTURE ALMOST TRIPLE THE RIDERSHIP -- WILL HAVE TO INVEST MORE IN THE SYSTEM -- ELECTRIFICATION START BUT WITHOUT ELECTRIFICATION WE NEVER GET THEIR SO I'M I'M HERE TO SAY WITHOUT GIVING A WHOLE BUNCH OF DETAILS BECAUSE WE'VE REPORTED OUT TO THE COMMITTEE PREVIOUSLY AND AND WE CAN PROVIDE AS MANY DETAILS AS YOU'D LIKE. BUT I WOULD CHARACTERIZE AGAIN -- OUR PARTNERSHIP WITH HIGH SPEED RAIL AS A HOME RUN FOR HIGH SPEED RAIL ACCUSES GIVES IT ACCESS. TO OUR RIGHT AWAY WHICH IS YOU KNOW FIFTY MILES IN LENGTH. A HUNDRED MILES IN TRACKS IF YOU GO BACK AND FORTH -- WHICH IS A VERY SIGNIFICANT -- OF OF OF VALUE I BELIEVE WAS A HOME RUN FOR CALTRAIN AS WELL. IN WHEN THE STARS ALIGN IN ONE HIGH SPEED RAIL IS ABLE TO OPERATE FROM A GILROY TO SAN FRANCISCO AND FROM THE VALLEY TO THE VALLEY. WE'RE GONNA BE THERE WE'RE GONNA BE READY WE'RE GONNA BE WORKING TOGETHER IN A BLENDED SYSTEM AND I I CAN'T WAIT FOR THAT TIME SO I APPRECIATE THAT YOUR YOUR TIME AND AND LISTENING TO US AND BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. PROVIDING FURTHER DETAILS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH NOW AT THIS POINT WILL ENTERTAIN ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS -- SOME OF WOMAN FRIEDMAN. THANKS I'M NOT REALLY SURE THIS IS A QUESTION BUT I JUST WANTED -- TO MAKE A LITTLE STATEMENT FOR SOMEONE TO THANK ALL OF YOU FOR BEING HERE AND IT'S GREAT TO SEE MISTER WASHINGTON HERE DOES A GREAT JOB -- WITH THIS HOME AND LA METRO SO THANKS FOR BEING HERE -- I KNOW THAT SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES EARLIER AND ONE OF THE EARLIER PANELS TALKED ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA OF THE BURBANK TO ANAHEIM ROUTE. AND I JUST WANT TO MENTION -- SOMETHING TO WHOEVER AND I'M NOT EVEN SURE WHO I'M SAYING THIS TO BUT JUST TO GET ON THE RECORD THAT BURBANK AIRPORT IS ABOUT TO UNDERGO. THE START THE CONSTRUCTION OF A NEW TERMINAL -- WHICH IS A MAJOR PIECE OF INFRASTRUCTURE FOR THE AREA. AND A GIVEN THAT THE PLAN IF THE HIGH SPEED RAIL COMES THROUGH IS THAT THE STATION FOR LOS ANGELES WILL BE AT THE BURBANK AIRPORT. I JUST THINK THAT IT WOULD BE A SHAME FOR THE PLANNING AND CONSTRUCTION OF THE AIRPORT TO NOT INCLUDE. THAT EVENTUAL HIGH SPEED RAIL OR IMPROVED RAIL INFRASTRUCTURE -- BECAUSE IF YOU BUILD A TERMINAL IT DOESN'T HAVE CONNECTIVITY THAT DOESN'T WORK IN CONCERT WITH WHAT COULD BE A MAJOR TRAIN TERMINAL YOU LOSE THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE A WELL THOUGHT OUT TRANSIT HUB FOR SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. SO THAT PIECE OF INFRASTRUCTURE. VERY CRUCIAL PART OF RAIL TRANSPORTATION ALONG WITH UNION STATION OF COURSE BUT COORDINATING LIKE THAT WITH AN AIRPORT -- BECOMES THIS IS HAS SORT OF HAS A MULTIPLIER EFFECT. OF CONNECTIVE ITTY AND TRANSIT SO I DO HOPE THAT THAT'S STILL PART OF THE PLANNING PROCESS AND THAT WE CAN SORT OF FIGURE THIS OUT BEFORE IT BURBANK GETS TOO FAR DOWN THE ROAD WITH THEIR PLANNING PROCESS. AND THEY ARE DOING THEIR DESIGN CHARETTE RIGHT NOW THERE ARE EVER TO THEY'VE ALREADY DONE SEVERAL IN BURBANK THEY'RE MOVING NOW. TO A GLENDALE IN PASADENA. AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS IN THE AIRPORT AND RIGHT NOW IT IS FAR AS I KNOW THEY'RE PROCEEDING WITH THE DESIGN OF AN AIRPORT THAT DOESN'T INCLUDE A HIGH SPEED RAIL STATION AS PART OF IT AND AND THAT WOULD REALLY BE. A MISSED OPPORTUNITY THAT DOWN THE ROAD WE'RE GOING TO WORK RIGHT. AND IT'S GONNA BE VERY EXPENSIVE TO TRY TO RETROFIT THAT TERMINAL. TO HAVE. YOU KNOW TO BE THE KIND OF TROUBLE YOU SEE IN YOUR REPORTS BOTH AIRPORT AND BROWN. SO I DON'T KNOW IF ANYONE HAS A RESPONSE MAYBE MISTER WASHINGTON -- BUT THAT'S MY CONCERN AND AS I REPRESENT THE AIRPORT -- SOMETHING THAT I YOU KNOW HAD AND WAS ON THE AIRPORT COMMISSION MYSELF FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS -- YOU KNOW REALLY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE I TAKE CARE OF THAT IMPORTANT AMENITY THE DISTORTIONS YOU RECOGNIZE SURE NO WE AGREE -- I AGREE I I FLEW OUT OF BURBANK -- TODAY -- COMING UP HERE -- I AGREE WE WE WANT TO BE PARTNERS WITH THE HIGH SPEED RAIL TO MAKE THOSE IMPROVEMENTS -- WENT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT AIRPORTS HAVE SAID -- YOU KNOW IN PUBLIC THAT WE SHOULD HAVE A REAL CONNECTION AT EVERY AIRPORT TO EVERY AIRPORT -- IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE'RE BUILDING ONE WITH MEASURE AROUND DOLLARS -- TO LA ACTS RIGHT NOW -- IN THAT BUILDING IS GOING ON RIGHT NOW SO WHAT WE COULDN'T AGREE MORE -- WITH THE IMPROVEMENTS THAT SHOULD BE DONE NOW SO YOU DO NOT HAVE TO RETROFIT OF GOING BACK SO WE AGREE WITH THAT COMPLETELY AND WE LOOK TO PARTNER WITH. A HIGH SPEED RAIL THE AIRPORT IN ANYONE YEAH AND MUCH WILLING -- TO MAKE SURE THAT HAPPENS -- AT THE FRONT END AND NOT THE BACK IN. I ONE QUESTION FOR YOU -- JUST STAY AT THE MICROPHONE TO WASHINGTON CAN YOU ELABORATE ON HOW THE FEDERAL -- DISENGAGEMENT IS AFFECTING THE UNION THE LA UNION STATIONS PROJECT AND HOW CAN WE MITIGATE THIS PROBLEM. WELL. YOU KNOW LIKE -- ANYONE ELSE WE WE HEARD THAT NEWS -- YOU KNOW ON THESE LARGE PROJECTS -- AND I HAVE -- QUITE A BIT OF EXPERIENCE IN LARGE PROJECTS WHERE YOU HAVE FUNDING THAT -- DOES NOT MATERIALIZE BUT YOU YOU KEEP WORKING AT AND I THINK THAT -- OUR DEALINGS WITH THE HIGH SPEED RAIL -- ON THIS IN TERMS OF STICKING -- TO SOME OF THE FUNDING THINGS AND AND UNDERSTANDING THE RISK ASSOCIATED -- WITH -- OF FUNDING ASSUMPTIONS -- HAPPENS ON THESE BIG PROJECTS ALL THE TIME SO I THINK THAT -- GOING BACK IN APPEALING TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ON THESE FUNDS MAKES A LOT OF SENSE TO ME -- AND I THINK -- JUST PERSONALLY SPEAKING I THINK EVENTUALLY -- THOSE FUNDS WILL BE -- RECOUPED IF YOU WILL IN TIME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU AND COME BACK -- I APOLOGIZE FOR MY ABSENCE -- STACY WHAT KIND OF A WHAT TYPE OF DISCUSSIONS HAVE YOU HAD WITH THE AUTHORITY ABOUT OPERATING. IN TERMS OF HIGH SPEED SERVICE AND ARE YOU CONCERNED ABOUT LITIGATION REGARDING. PROPOSITION ONE DAY. I THINK THAT NOTION IS BEEN LOOSELY DISCUSSED I HOLD THE NOTION THAT. HIGH SPEED RAIL SHOULD BE GIVEN TO HIGH SPEED RAIL SHOULD BE DEMONSTRATED ON THE INITIAL SEGMENT TEST THE HIGH SPEED TRAINS. ELECTRIFY IT REALLY LOOK AT WHETHER IT'S VIABLE TO KEEP MOVING -- SO I HAVEN'T REALLY ENGAGED MUCH IN WHETHER OR NOT. THE SAN JOAQUIN'S OUR ACE WHAT OPERATE THAT I THINK WE CAN PLAY A PART IN THE ULTIMATE SOLUTION. BUT I DO THINK THERE IS A CHANCE TO DEMONSTRATE AND I THINK UNDER CERTAIN SCENARIOS IT COULD PAY FOR ITSELF NOT FULL SERVICE BUT MAYBE SPECIALIZED SERVICE MORE EXPRESSED DIAL SERVICE. AND THEN THE OTHER CONVENTIONAL SERVICES FILL IN THE GAPS. THAT THAT ARE SUBSIDIZED TODAY SO I THINK IT'S TOO EARLY TO PREDICT. THAT ANOTHER OPERATOR IS NEEDED ON THAT SEGMENT BUT IT'S CERTAINLY AN OPTION DOWN THE ROAD. THANK YOU JUST ONE MORE QUESTION FOR YOU -- DO YOU HAVE ALL THE FUNDING AND EQUIPMENT YOU NEED TO GET TO MERCED CONNECT WITH HIGH SPEED RAIL. NO -- OUR INITIAL FUNDING THAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON TO MERCED CAME AS PART OF THE SP ONE SP ONE THIRTY TWO PACKAGE. IN IT WE WERE SHORT FOR FULL EXTENSION TO MERCED WE CAN MAKE IT TO SERIES. BUT NOT TO MERCED SO PART OF THAT PACKAGE WAS SOME EFFORT BY THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND IN THE STATE. TO HELP LEVERAGE ONE TRAIN DOWN TO MERCEDAND I THINK WITH THE REAL ROAD WE ARE CLOSE TO DOING THAT WITH THE EXISTING FUNDING PACKAGE. BUT WE DO NOT HAVE THE FULL FUNDING PACKAGE TO MEET UP WITH SAY SIX OR EIGHT TRAINS BECAUSE IF YOU HAVE SIX OR EIGHT WITH ACE. AND EIGHT OR NINE WAS SEMI KEANE'S YOU PRETTY MUCH CAN TAKE THE WHOLE SPIGOT THAT HIGH SPEED RAIL IS PLANNING INITIALLY -- BUT WE ARE WE ARE LACKING SOMEWHERE BETWEEN TWO HUNDRED TO TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION. TO DOUBLE TRACK THE MERCED PORTION U. P. MIGHT WORK WITH US TO NOT THAT NUMBER DOWN A LITTLE BIT AND I STOCKTON DIAMOND -- MUCH LIKE THE CLINTON CROSSING IMPROVEMENT WE'RE LOOKING AT THAT AND STOCKTON THAT FREES UP NETWORK FLUIDITY FOR THE RAILROADS AND SO THEY'RE MORE INCLINED TO MAYBE LET US. GO WITHOUT DOUBLE TRACKING THE WHOLE WAY BUT I I WOULD SAY SOMEWHERE AROUND TWO HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS TO LONG STRETCH IT'S GOT A LOT OF RIVER CROSSINGS [inaudible] BUDGET. THIS NEW PLANET OF THE NEW PLAN HINGES ON A CLOSE PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THE AUTHORITY. AND A SAN JOAQUIN'S. HAS THE AUTHORITY BUT A GOOD PARTNER ON THE THIS CALTRAIN PROJECT. WELL I THINK -- YOU KNOW THE THE AUTHORITY IS A ONE OF OUR FUNDING PARTNERS -- WE HAVE SEVERAL FUNDING PARTNERS. AND WITHOUT THE HIGH SPEED ROLES OF FUNDING PARTNER WE WOULD NOT. BE ABLE TO DO OUR ELECTRIFICATION PROJECT AT ALL. AND SO THEY ARE A CRITICAL PARTNER FOR US. AND YOU KNOW WE WORK CLOSELY TOGETHER ON BLENDED PLANNING WHICH IS -- WHAT'S REQUIRED WHEN HIGH SPEED ROLE -- COMES ON TO THE RIGHT AWAY -- I THINK WE'VE DONE -- WELL AND WORK TOGETHER ON THE BLENDING PLANNING SIDE OF THINGS -- AND WE WILL NEVER WILL BE HAVE ISSUES BETWEEN US -- OVER TIME IN TERMS OF HOW BEST TO PROCEED ON ONE THING OR ANOTHER -- I EXPECT THAT THERE I WILL CALL THAT CONSTRUCTIVE TENSION IT'S JUST INEVITABLE AND IN ANY KIND OF PARTNERSHIP RELATIONSHIP -- AND I THINK -- WITH GOOD WILL WE JUST WORK THROUGH THOSE. IS THERE ANY INTENTION -- WITH CALTRAIN. AS DIRECTOR CURTAIN HAD MENTIONED EARLIER. FOR THE CALTRAIN TO MAKE AN INVESTMENT TOWARDS -- MERCED [inaudible] NO. ZERO WE'RE WAIT WE'VE NEVER BEEN APPROACHED ON IT SO I CAN'T SAY THERE'S ANY INTENTION WAS NOT BEEN SOMETHING THAT'S EVER BEEN DISCUSSED WITH THIS. WE'RE ALWAYS TRYING TO THINK OF OUT OF THE BOX SOLUTIONS YES -- WERE WERE -- WE'RE STRUGGLING TO WHERE I CAPTURE THE FUTURE ON THE CALTRAIN LINE. AND WE'RE LOOKING TO MAKE ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS THERE. LOOK FOR TO YOU POSSIBLY LOOKING OUT OF THE OUT OF THE BOX. BECAUSE LIKE I SAID WE INVEST IN YOU YEAH THANK YOU THANK ON FILM -- WHAT OTHER TYPE OF REAL IMPROVEMENTS OR -- TOP PRIORITIES FOR THE ONLY REGION -- AND NOT JUST THE PROMISES THAT HAVE MADE BY THE SWORD. WELL I THINK IS IS COMMITTEE KNOWS WE WANT TO THE BALLOT IN NOVEMBER TWENTY SIXTEEN FOR MEASURE AROUND FOR NEW HAVE SINCE SALES TAX -- TO BUILD -- FORTY MAJOR -- INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS -- IN THE NEXT FORTY YEARS -- AND WE ARE IN FOR BILL MOLD RIGHT NOW WE ARE MANAGING ABOUT TWENTY BILLION DOLLARS CURRENTLY AND RAIL PROJECTS -- WE HAVE OUR TWENTY EIGHT BY -- TWENTY TWENTY EIGHT TO BILL TWENTY A PROJECTS BY -- TWENTY TWENTY EIGHT SO THERE ARE A NUMBER OF ACTIVITIES IN A NUMBER OF PROJECTS ARE VERY VERY IMPORTANT TO US -- I MENTION UNION STATION IN MY TESTIMONY -- THE FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS THAT IS THAT HAS BEEN COMMITTED -- BY HIGH SPEED RAIL -- TO UNION STATION IS VERY% VERY IMPORTANT IN OUR OVERALL -- UNION STATION OR LINK U. S. PLAN -- WHICH IS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF NINE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS AND SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT -- SHARING AND PARTNERSHIPS AND ALL OF THAT WE ARE DOING THAT RIGHT NOW WITH. A NINE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR PLAN THAT INCLUDES SOME MEASURE IN MONEY AND INCLUDES -- AND THAT INCLUDES THE PHONE IN TWENTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS AS COMMITTED BY HIGH SPEED RAIL SO WE ARE PUTTING OUR MONEY WHERE OUR MOUTH IS -- WITH REGARD -- TO INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND THE HIGH SPEED RAIL MONEY -- OR COMMITMENT OBVIOUSLY -- IS A BIG PART OF THAT. WHEN IS THE ANTICIPATED NEED? UGH GOING FORWARD FOR WHAT YOU FEEL. TO BE PRODUCTIVE IN IN WHAT WITH THE CAMILLUS WHEN WOULD YOU NEED THE MONEY YESTERDAY -- BUT YOU KNOW WE HAVE A COMMITMENT -- OF THIS FALL -- FOR THAT FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS AND WE'RE WORKING WITH THE HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY -- TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN -- I'M TOLD THAT THAT IS ON TRACK FOR THIS FALL -- AND WE CAN REPORT BACK TO YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN -- WHETHER IT HAPPENS OR NOT BUT I'M PRETTY CONFIDENT -- THAT IT WILL HAPPEN -- I'M TOLD THAT IT WILL GO TO THE HIGH SPEED -- REAL BOARD IN OCTOBER OF THIS YEAR.

A COMMITMENT TO CLEAN LOW AND NO CARBON TRANSPORTATION STRATEGIES. THAT HELP REDUCE POLLUTION. IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY HOME TO SOME OF THE NATION'S WORST AIR QUALITY. AND HIGHEST ASTHMA RATES. SAID FRESNO AND BAKERSFIELD ARE HOME TO NEARLY ONE MILLION CALIFORNIANS. AND THE RESPECTIVE COUNTIES MERCED FRESNO KERN HAVE A POPULATION IN EXCESS OF TWO MILLION PEOPLE. THE CITIES IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY ARE AMONG CALIFORNIA'S FASTEST GROWING COMMUNITIES RIGHT WITH OPPORTUNITY TO CARRY CALIFORNIA. INTO A SUSTAINABLE FUTURE. GOVERNOR NEWSOME'S COMMITMENT ENVISIONED FOR HIGH SPEED RAIL IS MEMORIALIZED IN THE MAY. TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN PROJECT UPDATE REPORT WITH THE INCLUSION OF A CENTRAL VALLEY SEGMENT. THAT CUTS TRAVEL TIME IN HALF BETWEEN THE CITIES IN THE VALLEY. COMPARED TO TODAY'S RAIL SERVICE OR TRAVELING BY CAR. REPORTER FRIENDS A HIGH SPEED RAIL LINE THAT PROVIDES CONNECTIONS AND MERCED. TO THE ALTAMONT CORRIDOR EXPRESS OR A STRAIN. IN THE SAN JOAQUIN SERVICE TO OAKLAND AND TO SACRAMENTO. THE PROJECT IS TRANSFORMATIVE FOR THE CENTRAL VALLEY HIT MAINTAINS IMPORTANT TARGETED INVESTMENTS ADOPTED BY THE HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY IN THE BAY AREA -- FOR THE BAY AREA AND LOS ANGELES. THIS KEY TO OPENING UP VALLEY THE VALLEY ACCESS TO PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES FOR COMPANIES TO EXPAND. TO THE CENTRAL VALLEY. AND OFFERING AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROSPECTS THAT ALIGN WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OVERALL GOALS TO ENSURE STATEWIDE. CORDED INVESTMENTS. HIGH SPEED RAIL CONNECTS WERE SAID IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY TO THE MAKE A REGION'S EFFORTS FROM THE BAY AREA. WRITING A REGIONAL PERSPECTIVE TO HOW. WE ADDRESS HOUSING. WORK FORCE AND EDUCATIONAL ISSUES THIS INCLUDES LEVERAGING STATE INVESTMENTS AND DYNAMIC INSTITUTIONS SUCH AS YOU SEE MERCED. CITY MERCED HAS BEEN AND REMAINS SUPPORTIVE OF HIGH SPEED RAIL.

FOR THEIR STEADFAST SUPPORT MOVING FORWARD -- PUSHING BACK AGAINST THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND OUTLINING A NEW VISION TRIMS THE GOVERNOR -- FOR THIS PROJECT MOVING FORWARD THAT WE ALSO SUPPORT -- AS THE LA REPORT IN TODAY'S HEARING MENTIONED THREE POINT NINE BILLION IS ALREADY BEEN SPENT ON THIS PROJECT -- IN THE SENATE'S OVERSIGHT HEARING FROM MARCH THEY LAID OUT -- WHAT THAT MEANS -- TWENTY SIX HUNDRED PLUS JOBS OVER FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY SMALL BUSINESSES. HAVE BENEFITTED HUNDRED FIFTY NINE DISADVANTAGED BUSINESSES OF BENEFITS. OVER TWO HUNDRED FIFTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS AND PAY TO SMALL BUSINESSES. I DOING WORK ON THIS PROJECT RESULTING IN BETWEEN SIX POINT EIGHT AND SEVEN POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS. IN ECONOMIC OUTPUT IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. BUT THIS PROJECT ISN'T JUST ABOUT THE ECONOMIC BENEFITS -- TO CALIFORNIA IT'S ALSO ABOUT RGH EAGLES -- WE HAVE ROBUST. STEEP GOALS TO MEET TO FIX THE PROBLEMS RELATED TO CLIMATE CHANGE WHAT DOESN'T HELP WITH THOSE G. B. CHINOS GHG GOALS IS SOME INFORMATION. THAT I PULLED OUT OF A TWO THOUSAND AND ELEVEN LA -- REPORT ABOUT THE INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS OF THIS STATE -- OUTSIDE OF HIGH SPEED RAIL -- THEY REPORTED THAT OVER THREE THOUSAND NEW MAIN MILES OF FREEWAY FIVE AIRPORT RUNWAYS NINETY NEW DEPARTURE GATES. AT A COST OF A HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS WOULD BE NEEDED TO ACCOMMODATE THE PRESUMED INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS IN OUR SYSTEM AND THE PRESUMED. OF POPULATION GROWTH -- OBVIOUSLY THAT'S MUCH MORE THAN WHAT THIS PROJECT IS GOING TO COST WE THINK ALL THAT HAD SHOULD HAPPEN AS WELL AS THIS. TO TO MAKE A TRULY TWENTY FIRST CENTURY -- OF INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEM -- AFFORDABLE HOUSING IS ALSO -- SO THEY CAN BE FIXED BY THIS PROJECT MOVING PEOPLE FROM AREAS OF LOW UNEMPLOYMENT. AND LE -- LOW HOUSING COSTS TO PLACES WHERE THERE IS MORE ARE MORE JOBS BUT HOUSING COSTS ARE MORE EXPENSIVE. I THINK IT'S A WE THINK IT'S A CRITICAL PART OF THAT SOLUTION AS WELL.
