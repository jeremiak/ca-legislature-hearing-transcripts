00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:52.485
SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT- BUT TO YOUR

00:05:52.552 --> 00:05:54.487
POINT- WE EXPECT THAT MOST THAT

00:05:54.554 --> 00:05:56.489
SURPLUS IS ONE TIME IN NATURE.

00:05:56.556 --> 00:05:57.724

00:05:57.790 --> 00:06:00.159
PROPOSES ALLOCATING NEARLY 80%

00:06:00.226 --> 00:06:02.428

00:18:23.001 --> 00:18:24.002
WORRIED THAT THE FEDERAL

00:18:24.069 --> 00:18:24.937
GOVERNMENT HAS STEPPED BACK IN

00:18:25.003 --> 00:18:26.205
THIS AREA WHEN IT COMES TO

00:18:26.271 --> 00:18:28.540
CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION.

00:18:28.607 --> 00:18:30.709

TO OFFER SOME COMMENTS ON SOME

00:22:10.362 --> 00:22:12.130
OF THE KEY CHOICES AS WE SEE

00:22:12.197 --> 00:22:13.999
THEM- WITHIN THE BUDGET

00:22:14.066 --> 00:22:15.667
PARTICULARLY WITH REGARD TO THE

00:22:15.734 --> 00:22:17.202
STATE'S ESTIMATED DISCRETIONARY

00:22:17.269 --> 00:22:20.772
RESOURCES. AND THEN THIRD- I

WOULD JUST OFFER A VIEW OF.

00:22:23.375 --> 00:22:25.077
WHAT THE WHOLE PACKAGE AND WHAT

00:22:25.143 --> 00:22:27.512
ITS IMPLICATIONS ARE FOR THE

00:22:27.579 --> 00:22:28.380
STATE'S BUDGET CONDITION AND

00:22:28.447 --> 00:22:30.182

WITH PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT

00:22:38.757 --> 00:22:40.258
NO ADDRESS IT SEPARATELY

00:22:40.325 --> 00:22:41.159
BECAUSE AS YOU KNOW

00:22:41.226 --> 00:22:43.628
PROPOSITION. NINETY EIGHT UNDER

00:22:43.695 --> 00:22:44.596
THE STATE CONSTITUTION

00:22:44.663 --> 00:22:45.931
ESTABLISHES THE MINIMUM FUNDING

00:22:45.997 --> 00:22:47.966
LEVEL FOR SCHOOLS. AND AS WE

00:22:48.033 --> 00:22:49.568
ALREADY HEARD- IN THE IN THE

00:22:49.634 --> 00:22:52.104
COMING BUDGET YEAR THE PROPOSAL

00:22:52.170 --> 00:22:54.506
INCLUDES EIGHTY FOUR BILLION

00:22:54.573 --> 00:22:55.507
FOR THE TOTAL PROPOSITION

00:22:55.574 --> 00:22:57.242
NINETY EIGHT BUDGET. NOW OF

00:22:57.309 --> 00:22:58.977
THIS THERE'S ABOUT DID THIS

00:22:59.044 --> 00:23:00.412
REPRESENTS A TWO POINT FIVE

00:23:00.479 --> 00:23:01.613
BILLION DOLLAR INCREASE FROM

00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:03.615
THE CURRENT YEAR. AND OF THAT

00:23:03.682 --> 00:23:04.983
TWO POINT FIVE BILLION THE

00:23:05.050 --> 00:23:07.819
GOVERNOR PROPOSES. ALLOCATING

00:23:07.886 --> 00:23:09.654
ONE POINT FOUR BILLION TO NEW

00:23:09.721 --> 00:23:11.256
ONGOING SPENDING PRIMARILY TO

00:23:11.323 --> 00:23:12.758
FIND THE COST OF LIVING

00:23:12.824 --> 00:23:14.392
ADJUSTMENT. IN THE LOCAL

00:23:14.459 --> 00:23:16.328
CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA. AND

00:23:16.394 --> 00:23:18.730
THEN HE HOLDS ONE POINT ONE

00:23:18.797 --> 00:23:21.099
BILLION IN ALLOCATE STAFF FOR

00:23:21.166 --> 00:23:23.468
ONE TIME PURPOSES. WE THINK

00:23:23.535 --> 00:23:25.237
THAT THAT SPLIT IS PRUDENT.

00:23:25.303 --> 00:23:27.405
BECAUSE IT WOULD ALLOW FOR THE

00:23:27.472 --> 00:23:29.007
BUDGET THE PROPOSITION NINETY

00:23:29.074 --> 00:23:29.808
EIGHT BUDGET TO ACCOMMODATE A

00:23:29.875 --> 00:23:32.477
DECLINE IN THE GUARANTEE LEVEL-

00:23:32.544 --> 00:23:34.012
WITHOUT NECESSARILY NEEDING TO

00:23:34.079 --> 00:23:37.282
MAKE CUTS TO ONGOING PROGRAMS.

00:23:37.349 --> 00:23:39.050
A COUPLE OF OTHER COMMENTS THAT

00:23:39.117 --> 00:23:41.686
WE HAVE IS THAT ALTHOUGH. MANY

00:23:41.753 --> 00:23:44.422
OF THE PROPOSALS ARE IN THE ONE

00:23:44.489 --> 00:23:47.325
TIME- CATEGORY. B. ADDRESS IN

00:23:47.392 --> 00:23:49.628
MANY CASES THEY ADDRESS SOME

00:23:49.694 --> 00:23:50.428
LONG STANDING ISSUES FACING

00:23:50.495 --> 00:23:52.430
EDUCATION AND FACING THE STATE.

00:23:52.497 --> 00:23:54.032
AND SO YOU KNOW WE JUST THINK

00:23:54.099 --> 00:23:55.367
THAT THE LEGISLATURE MAY WANT

00:23:55.433 --> 00:23:57.102
TO CONSIDER WHETHER SOME OF THE

00:23:57.169 --> 00:23:59.104
ISSUES THAT THEY- HAVE PROPOSED

00:23:59.171 --> 00:24:00.839
TO ADDRESS. ARE ACTUALLY BETTER

00:24:00.906 --> 00:24:04.009
SUITED FOR- TO BE SUPPORTED BY

00:24:04.075 --> 00:24:06.411
A ONGOING FUNDING. THE SECOND.

00:24:06.478 --> 00:24:08.246
AREA THAT I WOULD MENTION IN

00:24:08.313 --> 00:24:11.249
THIS- PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT.

00:24:11.316 --> 00:24:16.588
SECTION IS JUST EXCUSE ME. THIS

00:24:16.655 --> 00:24:20.625
IS JUST THE- WHETHER OR NOT THE

00:24:20.692 --> 00:24:22.394
LEGISLATURE WOULD PREFER TO

00:24:22.460 --> 00:24:24.029
REPURPOSE SOME OF THE ONE TIME

00:24:24.095 --> 00:24:26.665
FUNDING IN THE AREAS OF THE

00:24:26.731 --> 00:24:28.500
STATES THAT THE DISTRICTS IN

00:24:28.567 --> 00:24:29.901
THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS LONG TERM

00:24:29.968 --> 00:24:32.504
LIABILITIES AND THAT WOULD BE

00:24:32.571 --> 00:24:34.406
ONE CONSIDERATION IF THE

00:24:34.472 --> 00:24:36.441
LEGISLATURE WANTED TO MAXIMIZE

00:24:36.508 --> 00:24:39.344
THE FISCAL IMPACT FOR THE

00:24:39.411 --> 00:24:40.745
DISTRICTS OVER THE LONGER TERM.

00:24:40.812 --> 00:24:44.149
YOU CAN SO MOVING ON TO THE

00:24:44.216 --> 00:24:45.684
NEXT SLIDE HERE REALLY MOVING

00:24:45.750 --> 00:24:47.485
PAST THE PROPOSITION NINETY

00:24:47.552 --> 00:24:49.521
EIGHT- PORTION OF THE OF THE

00:24:49.588 --> 00:24:51.223
BUDGET SOME REALLY TALKING

00:24:51.289 --> 00:24:52.757
ABOUT EVERYTHING ELSE WITHIN

00:24:52.824 --> 00:24:54.326
THE PROPOSITION- WITHIN THE

00:24:54.392 --> 00:24:56.127
WITHIN THE BUDGET YOU'LL NOTE

00:24:56.194 --> 00:24:57.462
HERE AT THE TOP OF THE SLIDE WE

00:24:57.529 --> 00:24:59.598
REFER TO A SIX BILLION DOLLAR

00:24:59.664 --> 00:25:02.133
SURPLUS. AND IN THIS CONTEXT

00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:03.869
WHEN I SEE SURPLUS WHAT I MEAN

00:25:03.935 --> 00:25:04.870
BY THAT IS THE AMOUNT OF

00:25:04.936 --> 00:25:07.405
ESTIMATED RESOURCES. ABOVE WHAT

00:25:07.472 --> 00:25:09.007
THE STATE WILL NEED TO FIND ITS

00:25:09.074 --> 00:25:11.009
CONSTITUTIONAL REQUIREMENTS.

00:25:11.076 --> 00:25:13.111
AND IT'S EXISTING PROGRAM

00:25:13.178 --> 00:25:17.115
COMMITMENTS. SO ONE THING ABOUT

00:25:17.182 --> 00:25:18.884
THAT IS THAT IT'S VERY SIMILAR

00:25:18.950 --> 00:25:20.385
TO THE SURPLUS THAT WE ESTIMATE

00:25:20.452 --> 00:25:22.454
FOR THE COMING YEAR- IN THE

00:25:22.520 --> 00:25:23.855
REASON THAT IT'S SO SIMILAR IS

00:25:23.922 --> 00:25:24.923
THAT WE HAVE VERY SIMILAR

00:25:24.990 --> 00:25:26.892
REVENUE ESTIMATES IN FACT. THE

00:25:26.958 --> 00:25:28.526
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE HAS ONLY

00:25:28.593 --> 00:25:30.262
ABOUT THIRTY FOUR MILLION IN%

00:25:30.328 --> 00:25:32.330
HIGHER REVENUES IN THE BIG

00:25:32.397 --> 00:25:34.299
THREE REVENUES THAT OUR OFFICE

00:25:34.366 --> 00:25:35.433
SO THEY'RE VERY SIMILAR

00:25:35.500 --> 00:25:39.371
CELESTIN. POINT 1% OF- GEN OF

00:25:39.437 --> 00:25:44.342
THOSE REVENUES. ONE OTHER

00:25:44.409 --> 00:25:45.543
OBSERVATION THAT YOU'LL NOTE IN

00:25:45.610 --> 00:25:47.245
THE BUDGET IS THAT THERE ARE

00:25:47.312 --> 00:25:49.347
RELATIVELY HIGH NUMBER OF SMALL

00:25:49.414 --> 00:25:51.149
PROGRAM SO WHEN I SAY SMALL

00:25:51.216 --> 00:25:52.150
PROGRAMS IN THE CONTEXT OF THE

00:25:52.217 --> 00:25:53.785
BUDGET. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

00:25:53.852 --> 00:25:55.754
PROGRAMS WERE A PROPOSALS WORTH

00:25:55.820 --> 00:25:57.522
LESS THAN A HUNDRED BILLION

00:25:57.589 --> 00:26:00.358
HUNDRED MILLION. AND OVER 95%

00:26:00.425 --> 00:26:02.794
OF THE PROPOSALS ARE ACTUALLY

00:26:02.861 --> 00:26:04.896
FOR LESS THAN THAT AMOUNT SO

00:26:04.963 --> 00:26:06.932
THAT'S A NOTABLE FEATURE OF THE

00:26:06.998 --> 00:26:11.236
BUDGET PROPOSAL. GOING TO THE

00:26:11.303 --> 00:26:13.238
NEXT SLIDE HERE WERE DISPLAYING

00:26:13.305 --> 00:26:14.973
IN THE FIGURE OUT THE GOVERNOR

00:26:15.040 --> 00:26:16.608
PROPOSES TO ALLOCATE FOUR POINT

00:26:16.675 --> 00:26:19.811
ONE BILLION. IN THE SURPLUS

00:26:19.878 --> 00:26:23.715
ACROSS VARIOUS PROGRAM AREAS.

00:26:23.782 --> 00:26:25.650
AND YOU'LL SEE THAT AT A HIGH

00:26:25.717 --> 00:26:28.586
LEVEL. MUCH OF THE ONE TIME

00:26:28.653 --> 00:26:30.121
ALLOCATIONS ARE GOING TOWARD

00:26:30.188 --> 00:26:33.124
ADDRESSING THE HOMELESSNESS-

00:26:33.191 --> 00:26:33.658
ISSUE AS PROPOSED BY THE

00:26:33.725 --> 00:26:35.927
GOVERNOR. WE'RE AS MUCH OF THE

00:26:35.994 --> 00:26:38.029
ONGOING FUNDING GOES FOR HIGHER

00:26:38.096 --> 00:26:40.398
EDUCATION AND HEALTH CARE. AND

00:26:40.465 --> 00:26:41.499
IF YOU THINK ABOUT MY POINT ON

00:26:41.566 --> 00:26:43.768
THE PREVIOUS SLIDE. THAT

00:26:43.835 --> 00:26:45.470
THEY'RE A HIGH NUMBER OF

00:26:45.537 --> 00:26:47.405
RELATIVELY SMALL PROPOSALS.

00:26:47.472 --> 00:26:48.406
THIS PRISON THIS RAISES

00:26:48.473 --> 00:26:49.808
SOMEWHAT OF A TRADE OFF FOR THE

00:26:49.874 --> 00:26:51.876
LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER WHETHER

00:26:51.943 --> 00:26:53.545
IT WOULD FIRST PREFER TO PURSUE

00:26:53.611 --> 00:26:55.347
THAT APPROACH OR IF YOU WOULD

00:26:55.413 --> 00:26:58.350
RATHER DIRECT. YOU KNOW MORE OF

00:26:58.416 --> 00:26:59.985
ITS RESOURCES TO A FEWER NUMBER

00:27:00.051 --> 00:27:01.720
OF BIGGER TICKET ITEMS AND SO

00:27:01.786 --> 00:27:02.787
THAT SORT OF ONE OF THE BIGGER

00:27:02.854 --> 00:27:04.422
CHOICES FACING THE LEGISLATURE

00:27:04.489 --> 00:27:05.957
IS A COASTER THAT GOES THROUGH

00:27:06.024 --> 00:27:09.461
THIS BUDGET. ANOTHER POINT IS

00:27:09.527 --> 00:27:10.528
THAT WHEN YOU TAKE THE BUDGET

00:27:10.595 --> 00:27:13.098
PROPOSAL IN ITS ENTIRETY WE

00:27:13.164 --> 00:27:13.832
BELIEVE THAT IT HAS THE

00:27:13.898 --> 00:27:16.034
POTENTIAL TO EXERT UPWARD

00:27:16.101 --> 00:27:17.268
PRESSURE ON THE STATE'S COST

00:27:17.335 --> 00:27:19.237
STRUCTURE OVER THE LONG TERM.

00:27:19.304 --> 00:27:21.373
IN WAYS THAT GO BEYOND WATER

00:27:21.439 --> 00:27:24.142
INCLUDED IN THESE ESTIMATES. SO

00:27:24.209 --> 00:27:26.244
WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS THE

00:27:26.311 --> 00:27:27.846
GOVERNOR PROPOSES ONE POINT

00:27:27.912 --> 00:27:29.114
FOUR BILLION IN NEW ONGOING

00:27:29.180 --> 00:27:31.082
SPENDING AND WE CAN ESTIMATE

00:27:31.149 --> 00:27:33.051
THAT WOULD INCREASE TO ONE

00:27:33.118 --> 00:27:34.753
POINT EIGHT BILLION OVER TIME.

00:27:34.819 --> 00:27:37.122
BUT THEN HE DOES ALSO PROPOSE

00:27:37.188 --> 00:27:38.957
FOR THE STATE TO ENGAGE IN NEW

00:27:39.024 --> 00:27:41.493
ACTIVITIES AND AS- AN AS WE

00:27:41.559 --> 00:27:42.494
HEARD SOME OF SOME OF THESE

00:27:42.560 --> 00:27:45.397
ARE- REALLY BOLD AND IT WILL IN

00:27:45.463 --> 00:27:46.898
A WAY AND GO BEYOND. WHAT OTHER

00:27:46.965 --> 00:27:48.299
STATES HAVE EVEN DONE IN THE

00:27:48.366 --> 00:27:49.934
AREA OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS FOR

00:27:50.001 --> 00:27:52.170
EXAMPLE. NOW MANY OF THESE

00:27:52.237 --> 00:27:54.139
IDEAS MAY HAVE MERIT. AND THEY

00:27:54.205 --> 00:27:58.043
MAY BE. WORTH CONSIDERING BUT

00:27:58.109 --> 00:27:59.210
WE JUST THINK THAT THERE'S THE

00:27:59.277 --> 00:28:00.211
POTENTIAL THAT THEY WOULD

00:28:00.278 --> 00:28:02.347
INCREASE COSTS TO THE STATE ON

00:28:02.414 --> 00:28:04.382
AN ONGOING BASIS OVER THE LONG

00:28:04.449 --> 00:28:05.216
TERM AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT

00:28:05.283 --> 00:28:06.885
YOU SHOULD BE AWARE OF. AND WE

00:28:06.951 --> 00:28:07.786
DON'T HAVE ENOUGH INFORMATION

00:28:07.852 --> 00:28:10.955
AT THIS POINT TO. DETERMINE THE

00:28:11.022 --> 00:28:18.163
PRECISE AMOUNT. NOW IN THE NEXT

00:28:18.229 --> 00:28:20.598
SLIDE WHAT I'M SHOWING HERE IS

00:28:20.665 --> 00:28:22.333
A CHART THAT- DISPLAYS. THE

00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:26.037
GOVERNOR'S. PLAN OVER A MULTI

00:28:26.104 --> 00:28:29.374
YEAR OUTLOOK. AND WHAT YOU

00:28:29.441 --> 00:28:30.775
WOULD SEE FROM THIS IF I COULD

00:28:30.842 --> 00:28:31.776
DRAW YOUR ATTENTION TO THE

00:28:31.843 --> 00:28:33.812
DARKER SHADED PARTS OF THE BLUE

00:28:33.878 --> 00:28:36.214
BARS YOU WOULD SEE THAT THERE

00:28:36.281 --> 00:28:38.383
ARE SURPLUSES IN THE FUTURE

00:28:38.450 --> 00:28:40.685
YEARS BUT THE SURPLUS IS A

00:28:40.752 --> 00:28:44.055
RELATIVELY SMALL. FURTHERMORE

00:28:44.122 --> 00:28:45.423
THEY DEPEND ON THREE KEY

00:28:45.490 --> 00:28:47.625
ASSUMPTIONS ONE IS THAT THE

00:28:47.692 --> 00:28:49.828
ECONOMY CONTINUES TO GROW. THE

00:28:49.894 --> 00:28:51.062
SECOND IS THAT THE MANAGED CARE

00:28:51.129 --> 00:28:52.831
ORGANIZATION TAX IS APPROVED BY

00:28:52.897 --> 00:28:54.365
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT-

00:28:54.432 --> 00:28:56.768
STARTING IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE

00:28:56.835 --> 00:28:58.203
TWENTY TWO. AND THEN FINALLY

00:28:58.269 --> 00:29:00.171
THAT THE SUSPENDED PROGRAMS

00:29:00.238 --> 00:29:01.840
THAT WERE ALREADY MENTIONED

00:29:01.906 --> 00:29:03.241
THAT THOSE SUSPENSIONS DO TAKE

00:29:03.308 --> 00:29:06.177
A FACT IN TWENTY THREE TWENTY

00:29:06.244 --> 00:29:09.514
FOUR. AND IN FACT IF YOU. YES

00:29:09.581 --> 00:29:11.449
IF THOSE SUSPENSIONS DID NOT

00:29:11.516 --> 00:29:12.784
TAKE AFFECTING AS YOU RECALL

00:29:12.851 --> 00:29:15.019
FROM LAST BUDGET PROCESS WE

00:29:15.086 --> 00:29:16.721
QUESTIONED WHETHER THE PROGRAMS

00:29:16.788 --> 00:29:18.289
THAT WERE FUNDED WITH THE

00:29:18.356 --> 00:29:19.390
SUSPENSION PROVISIONS WERE

00:29:19.457 --> 00:29:22.760
REALLY- APPROPRIATE TO HAVE-

00:29:22.827 --> 00:29:24.863
THE SUSPENSION LANGUAGE IN THEM

00:29:24.929 --> 00:29:26.464
AND IF THOSE SUSPENSIONS DID

00:29:26.531 --> 00:29:28.533
NOT TAKE EFFECT AND THE OUT

00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:29.334
YEAR WOULD ACTUALLY SHOW

00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:31.536
DEFICIT SO THAT'S SOMETHING TO

00:29:31.603 --> 00:29:34.672
BE AWARE OF. SO ON THE FINAL

00:29:34.739 --> 00:29:35.874
PAGE ALEVIATE YOU WITH A

00:29:35.940 --> 00:29:37.876
COUPLE OF THOUGHTS THE FIRST IS

00:29:37.942 --> 00:29:40.578
JUST THAT- IF YOU KNOW THE

00:29:40.645 --> 00:29:41.546
LEGISLATURE MAY WANT TO

00:29:41.613 --> 00:29:42.881
CONSIDER WHETHER OR NOT THE

00:29:42.947 --> 00:29:46.017
TOTAL LEVEL OF RESERVES. SHOWN

00:29:46.084 --> 00:29:52.423
IN THE BUDGET OUR. WHETHER THE

00:29:52.490 --> 00:29:54.058
TOTAL LEVEL ELEVEN RESERVE

00:29:54.125 --> 00:29:57.529
SHOWN IN THE BUDGET ARE. IT'S

00:29:57.595 --> 00:29:58.897
SATISFACTORY TO THE

00:29:58.963 --> 00:30:02.534
LEGISLATURE'S. PREFERENCES FOR

00:30:02.600 --> 00:30:04.435
ONE THING THE GOVERNOR DOES NOT

00:30:04.502 --> 00:30:06.104
ADD TO THE DISCRETIONARY LEVEL

00:30:06.171 --> 00:30:09.073
OF RESERVES IN THIS BUDGET AND

00:30:09.140 --> 00:30:10.775
ALTHOUGH THERE IS AN INCREASE

00:30:10.842 --> 00:30:12.610
UNDER THE PROPOSITION TO A

00:30:12.677 --> 00:30:14.579
REQUIREMENTS THERE'S NO ADDED

00:30:14.646 --> 00:30:16.014
LEVEL OF RESERVE IN THE

00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:19.350
DISCRETIONARY PORTION. SO

00:30:19.417 --> 00:30:20.685
ANOTHER WAY TO BUILD BUDGET

00:30:20.752 --> 00:30:22.620
RESILIENCE WOULD BE TO INCREASE

00:30:22.687 --> 00:30:25.657
THE STATE'S OPERATING SURPLUS

00:30:25.723 --> 00:30:27.625
FROM WHAT IS CURRENTLY PROPOSED

00:30:27.692 --> 00:30:28.993
WE MENTIONED IN NOVEMBER THAT

00:30:29.060 --> 00:30:30.995
NO MORE THAN ONE BILLION SHOULD

00:30:31.062 --> 00:30:33.164
SEE SHOULD BE SPENT ON. NEW

00:30:33.231 --> 00:30:35.033
ONGOING PURPOSES GIVEN OUR

00:30:35.099 --> 00:30:37.068
OUTLOOK AND THE GOVERNOR SPEND

00:30:37.135 --> 00:30:38.870
A BIT MORE THAN THAT AND WHEN

00:30:38.937 --> 00:30:40.305
YOU THINK ABOUT THE RISK OF A

00:30:40.371 --> 00:30:44.342
RECESSION COMING IN THE- OVER

00:30:44.409 --> 00:30:46.144
THE OUTLOOK PERIOD WE THINK IT

00:30:46.211 --> 00:30:48.046
IS SOMEWHAT ELEVATED GIVEN SOME

00:30:48.112 --> 00:30:49.314
OF THE INDICATIONS THAT WE SEE

00:30:49.380 --> 00:30:51.516
NOW AND THE FACT THAT THE MID

00:30:51.583 --> 00:30:52.951
THE ECONOMIC EXPANSION IS QUITE

00:30:53.017 --> 00:30:54.852
MATURE AT THIS POINT. AND SO

00:30:54.919 --> 00:30:56.154
GIVEN THAT WE THINK THAT THE

00:30:56.221 --> 00:30:57.589
LEGISLATURE MAY WANT TO

00:30:57.655 --> 00:30:59.691
CONSIDER LARGER RESERVES FOR

00:30:59.757 --> 00:31:01.859
THE LARGER OPERATING SURPLUS

00:31:01.926 --> 00:31:03.394
EITHER WAY WE THINK THIS THE

00:31:03.461 --> 00:31:05.063
LEGISLATURE SHOULD CONSIDER

00:31:05.129 --> 00:31:06.965
CONTINUING TO BUILD THE STATE'S

00:31:07.031 --> 00:31:11.502
FISCAL RESILIENCE. THANK YOU

00:31:11.569 --> 00:31:13.972
VERY MUCH I SEE SENATOR RALPH

00:31:14.038 --> 00:31:16.307
FOLLOWED BY SENATOR MORLOCK

00:31:16.374 --> 00:31:18.476
SENATOR OFF. THE MANAGER OF CAN

00:31:18.543 --> 00:31:21.279
EITHER OF YOU- FIGURE THIS OUT

00:31:21.346 --> 00:31:22.413
CAN EITHER OF YOU TELL ME WHAT

00:31:22.480 --> 00:31:24.249
THE FISCAL IMPACT OF THE

00:31:24.315 --> 00:31:26.651
FAILURE PROVES THE EXTENSION OF

00:31:26.718 --> 00:31:31.022
THE MCO. TAX IS ON THE BUDGET

00:31:31.089 --> 00:31:33.691
IN TERMS OF DOLLARS. YEAH I'M

00:31:33.758 --> 00:31:35.226
HAPPY TO DO THAT IT WOULD BE SO

00:31:35.293 --> 00:31:36.794
WE ARE ON AN ANNUAL BASIS YEAH

00:31:36.861 --> 00:31:38.396
SO- WE'RE NOT ASSUMING IT FOR

00:31:38.463 --> 00:31:40.198
THE BUDGET YEAR ABOUT WERE IT

00:31:40.265 --> 00:31:42.667
NOT TO BE APPROVED- IT WOULD BE

00:31:42.734 --> 00:31:44.068
IN EXCESS OF A BILLION DOLLARS

00:31:44.135 --> 00:31:47.672
ON IN ANY. AND THEN SHIFTING

00:31:47.739 --> 00:31:50.241
GEARS TO. K. THROUGH TWELVE

00:31:50.308 --> 00:31:52.176
EDUCATION YOU KNOW CONSIDERING

00:31:52.243 --> 00:31:56.180
THE COLA THE SIZE OF THE COLA

00:31:56.247 --> 00:31:57.882
OR SOME WOULD SAY THE LACK OF

00:31:57.949 --> 00:32:00.351
THE SIZE THE COLA AND THE

00:32:00.418 --> 00:32:01.819
ROUGHLY NINE HUNDRED MILLION

00:32:01.886 --> 00:32:03.388
DOLLARS PROGRAM TO PROPOSED

00:32:03.454 --> 00:32:05.657
FOR- TEACHER RECRUITMENT IN

00:32:05.723 --> 00:32:06.958
PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND

00:32:07.025 --> 00:32:10.228
OTHER THINGS OVER OVER TIME.

00:32:10.295 --> 00:32:12.230
AND TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE

00:32:12.297 --> 00:32:14.465
CHALLENGES THAT ARE FACED NOW

00:32:14.532 --> 00:32:15.433
AND WILL BE PHASED IN THE

00:32:15.500 --> 00:32:16.901
FUTURE BY SCHOOL DISTRICTS

00:32:16.968 --> 00:32:19.003
WHICH WITH REGARD TO. DISTRICTS

00:32:19.070 --> 00:32:21.539
PORTION OF THE UNFUNDED PENSION

00:32:21.606 --> 00:32:23.975
LIABILITY. WAS ANY THOUGHT

00:32:24.042 --> 00:32:25.843
GIVEN TO INCREASING THE AMOUNT

00:32:25.910 --> 00:32:27.412
OF MONEY FLOWING TO DISTRICTS

00:32:27.478 --> 00:32:29.414
OR TWO COASTERS FOR OF.

00:32:29.480 --> 00:32:33.885
UNFUNDED LIABILITY BY DOWN. YES

00:32:33.951 --> 00:32:35.119
ALL MAKE A ONE OR TWO POINTS

00:32:35.186 --> 00:32:36.621
AND MY COLLEAGUE JESSICA MAIL

00:32:36.688 --> 00:32:38.022
OPERATE AS WELL I THINK THE

00:32:38.089 --> 00:32:39.957
FIRST THING IS THAT THE PAYMENT

00:32:40.024 --> 00:32:42.527
THAT WAS MADE LAST YEAR OF

00:32:42.593 --> 00:32:44.595
APPROXIMATELY AT THREE A LITTLE

00:32:44.662 --> 00:32:45.563
OVER THREE TWO THREE BILLION

00:32:45.630 --> 00:32:47.732
DOLLARS ON THAT WAS INTENDED TO

00:32:47.799 --> 00:32:48.633
FLOW AND THAT IF IT DISTRICTS

00:32:48.700 --> 00:32:50.368
OVER MULTIPLE YEARS AND NOT

00:32:50.435 --> 00:32:52.170
JUST IN INTENT THAT THAT'S WHAT

00:32:52.236 --> 00:32:53.638
WE HOPE WILL HAPPEN BUT IN THE

00:32:53.705 --> 00:32:54.772
WAY THAT IT WAS STRUCTURED IN

00:32:54.839 --> 00:32:56.808
SO THE WAY THAT THREE POINT ONE

00:32:56.874 --> 00:32:58.343
FIVE BILLION DOLLARS WAS WAS TO

00:32:58.409 --> 00:32:59.877
HELP BY DOWN SCHOOL DISTRICTS

00:32:59.944 --> 00:33:01.479
CONTRIBUTIONS. IN THE CURRENT

00:33:01.546 --> 00:33:02.513
YEAR OR THE YEAR WE'RE IN RIGHT

00:33:02.580 --> 00:33:04.615
NOW BUT THEN ALSO A PORTION OF

00:33:04.682 --> 00:33:06.050
THAT OF SEVERAL HUNDRED MILLION

00:33:06.117 --> 00:33:07.251
DOLLARS WAS TO BE FOR THE

00:33:07.318 --> 00:33:08.553
BUDGET YEAR SO FOR THIS YEAR TO

00:33:08.619 --> 00:33:11.255
CALM AND VAST MAJORITY OF THAT

00:33:11.322 --> 00:33:12.490
MONEY TWO POINT THREE BILLION

00:33:12.557 --> 00:33:14.592
DOLLARS WAS DEPOSITED TO CAL

00:33:14.659 --> 00:33:16.794
STIRS FOR THE LONG TERM SO THAT

00:33:16.861 --> 00:33:18.463
SHOULD REDUCE SCHOOL DISTRICTS

00:33:18.529 --> 00:33:20.264
CONTRIBUTIONS WHENEVER YOU'RE

00:33:20.331 --> 00:33:21.332
TO CALM OVER THE NEXT TWENTY

00:33:21.399 --> 00:33:22.967
YEARS AND SO WE PUT THAT THAT

00:33:23.034 --> 00:33:25.370
PROVIDE SOME RELIEF AND IT YOU

00:33:25.436 --> 00:33:27.305
KNOW. WAIT FOR LAW SCHOOL

00:33:27.372 --> 00:33:27.905
DISTRICT DOESN'T COULD NOT BUT

00:33:27.972 --> 00:33:29.273
THINK MAKE A DIFFERENCE OVER

00:33:29.340 --> 00:33:31.275
THE LONG TERM I THINK THE

00:33:31.342 --> 00:33:33.578
SECOND THING IS- THIS

00:33:33.644 --> 00:33:34.312
PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT LEVEL-

00:33:34.379 --> 00:33:35.947
IT HAS THAT CALL UP VER 2%

00:33:36.013 --> 00:33:37.982
THAT YOU MENTION FOR LCS FAST

00:33:38.049 --> 00:33:39.450
AND WE PUT IT ALL TOGETHER-

00:33:39.517 --> 00:33:40.752
EVEN AGAINST THE ADJUSTED

00:33:40.818 --> 00:33:42.387
LEVELS LAST YEAR IT'S

00:33:42.453 --> 00:33:43.755
ADDITIONAL TWO AND A HALF

00:33:43.821 --> 00:33:45.590
BILLION DOLLARS SO WE THINK

00:33:45.656 --> 00:33:46.591
THAT MAKES A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT.

00:33:46.657 --> 00:33:48.793
THERE WAS MY FOR TO WHAT YEAR

00:33:48.860 --> 00:33:49.961
AND THEN THE SEDITION ALL NINE

00:33:50.027 --> 00:33:50.828
HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS THIS

00:33:50.895 --> 00:33:52.263
YEAR AND THEN THE LAST THING

00:33:52.330 --> 00:33:53.965
I'LLMENTION- BECAUSE WE DID IT

00:33:54.031 --> 00:33:55.099
LAST YEAR BUT IT'S ALSO

00:33:55.166 --> 00:33:57.502
IMPORTANT FOR THIS YEAR IS THIS

00:33:57.568 --> 00:33:58.336
EXPANSION OF STATE SCHOOL

00:33:58.403 --> 00:34:00.204
PROGRAM- IT'S FOR NON ALLEY A

00:34:00.271 --> 00:34:01.172
SPORTS FULL DAY FOR YOUR

00:34:01.239 --> 00:34:03.274
PRESCHOOL- THAT WAS PULLED OUT

00:34:03.341 --> 00:34:04.475
OF THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT

00:34:04.542 --> 00:34:06.210
GUARANTEE LAST YEAR- AND SO

00:34:06.277 --> 00:34:07.845
THAT IT TOO TIONAL TEN THOUSAND

00:34:07.912 --> 00:34:08.780
SLOTS THAT WE'RE PROPOSING TO

00:34:08.846 --> 00:34:10.681
FUNDS THIS YEAR WHICH COMES AT

00:34:10.748 --> 00:34:11.983
A COST OF OVER A HUNDRED

00:34:12.049 --> 00:34:13.618
MILLION DOLLARS. ON THAT WILL

00:34:13.684 --> 00:34:15.052
BE IN ADDITION TO THE IGHTY

00:34:15.119 --> 00:34:17.188
FOUR GOING DOLLARS IN PROPERTY

00:34:17.255 --> 00:34:19.123
NINE EIGHT FUNDING SO WE THAT

00:34:19.190 --> 00:34:21.692
MY IS TIGHT AS FOR MANY

00:34:21.759 --> 00:34:22.827
DISTRICTS BUT WE THINK ALL THE

00:34:22.894 --> 00:34:31.002
IN TO GET WHAT CAN AND YOU WANT.

00:34:31.068 --> 00:34:31.769
I JUST CALLED. PERMANENT

00:34:31.836 --> 00:34:33.638
FINANCING. THE CAR. AND ROTH I

00:34:33.704 --> 00:34:36.307
WOULD ALSO ADD. HEAD TO THE X.

00:34:36.374 --> 00:34:37.442
AS IN THAT IN A TO THOSE IN THE-

00:34:37.508 --> 00:34:38.443
WE ALSO. ROLLING OVER THIS

00:34:38.509 --> 00:34:39.043
HUNDRED FORTY FIVE MILLION WE

00:34:39.110 --> 00:34:40.344
PROVIDED YEAR FOR ED. INTO

00:34:40.411 --> 00:34:41.946
INCREASING THE BASE GRAND FOR

00:34:42.013 --> 00:34:43.414
ALL SCHOOL DISTRICTS- IN

00:34:43.481 --> 00:34:44.949
ADDITION WE'RE ADDING ANOTHER

00:34:45.016 --> 00:34:45.550
TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION

00:34:45.616 --> 00:34:47.452
ON TOP OF THAT FOR ON THE

00:34:47.518 --> 00:34:49.387
EARLIEST LEARNERS BUT

00:34:49.454 --> 00:34:50.922
DISABILITIES. I'M SO THOSE ARE

00:34:50.988 --> 00:34:52.223
INCREASES FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS

00:34:52.290 --> 00:34:53.191
THAT SHOULD HELP THEM ADDRESS

00:34:53.257 --> 00:34:54.325
SOME OF THE COSTS THAT THEY'RE

00:34:54.392 --> 00:34:56.227
SEEING WITH SPECIAL EDUCATION.

00:34:56.294 --> 00:34:56.894
I THINK THE OTHER THING THAT WE

00:34:56.961 --> 00:34:58.029
HAD IN MIND IN TERMS OF

00:34:58.096 --> 00:34:59.130
BUILDING AND QUITE A BIT OF ONE

00:34:59.197 --> 00:35:02.333
TIME- INTO OUR ON GOING WAS AS

00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:04.101
AND FEEDBACK WE GOT FROM

00:35:04.168 --> 00:35:05.369
DISTRICTS AROUND WHAT

00:35:05.436 --> 00:35:06.537
INFORMATION IT IS THAT WE PUT

00:35:06.604 --> 00:35:08.973
OUT ABOUT COLA- AT GOVERNOR'S

00:35:09.040 --> 00:35:10.775
BUDGET. AND HOW AND TO THE

00:35:10.842 --> 00:35:12.643
EXTENT THAT WE PUT OUT A COLA

00:35:12.710 --> 00:35:14.111
ON THE SAY LIKE WHAT WITH

00:35:14.178 --> 00:35:15.446
SOMEONE CALL A SUPER COLA

00:35:15.513 --> 00:35:16.914
LARGER THAN THAT THE STATUTORY

00:35:16.981 --> 00:35:18.583
COLA. ON TO THE EXTENT THAT

00:35:18.649 --> 00:35:20.918
THAT IS THEN CUT MI REVISION-

00:35:20.985 --> 00:35:23.988
WHEN REVENUES IF REVENUES DROP-

00:35:24.055 --> 00:35:25.156
THAT THAT IS IT MAKES IT VERY

00:35:25.223 --> 00:35:26.457
DIFFICULT FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS

00:35:26.524 --> 00:35:28.626
AND TO BUDGET BECAUSE OF THE

00:35:28.693 --> 00:35:29.961
TIMING OF EVERYTHING. SO THOSE

00:35:30.027 --> 00:35:31.028
WERE OTHER THINGS THAT WE WERE

00:35:31.095 --> 00:35:32.163
KEEPING IN MIND WE WERE

00:35:32.230 --> 00:35:33.865
BUILDING THIS BUDGET. WELL I

00:35:33.931 --> 00:35:35.666
REALIZE IT'S NEVER ENOUGH

00:35:35.733 --> 00:35:36.667
MONEY. THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE SAY

00:35:36.734 --> 00:35:39.303
AND IT'S PROBABLY TRUE WHEN IT

00:35:39.370 --> 00:35:41.005
COMES TO SEVERAL THINGS IN

00:35:41.072 --> 00:35:43.241
CALIFORNIA BUDGET WILL CONTINUE

00:35:43.307 --> 00:35:45.443
THE CONVERSATION CERTAINLY ONE

00:35:45.510 --> 00:35:48.179
AREA WHERE WE CAN. THIS IS COOL

00:35:48.246 --> 00:35:48.813
TRICKS UP AND DOWN THE STATE IS

SPECIAL EDUCATION AND- I

00:35:52.383 --> 00:35:53.751
SUSPECT THAT IT IS TRUE AND

00:35:53.818 --> 00:35:55.219
THEY TELL ME THAT YOU KNOW THE

00:35:55.286 --> 00:35:58.723
FUNDING THAT THEY RECEIVE IS

00:35:58.789 --> 00:36:01.025
ONLY ABOUT 40% DEPEND ON THE

00:36:01.092 --> 00:36:02.059
DISTRICT OF THE- PER. SPECIAL

00:36:02.126 --> 00:36:04.061
EDUCATION SERVICES TO OUR MOST

00:36:04.128 --> 00:36:07.064
VULNERABLE. YOUNG PEOPLE SO. TO

00:36:07.131 --> 00:36:07.832
THE EXTENT THAT THERE IS

00:36:07.899 --> 00:36:09.166
ADDITIONAL MONEY AVAILABLE IN

00:36:09.233 --> 00:36:10.434
THE BUDGET THAT WE CAN RE

00:36:10.501 --> 00:36:12.637
DIRECT. TO DISTRICTS. TO HELP

00:36:12.703 --> 00:36:14.505
THEM COVER THE COST OF. SPECIAL

00:36:14.572 --> 00:36:16.007
EDUCATION WHICH THEY OTHERWISE

00:36:16.073 --> 00:36:17.542
HAVE TO PULL OUT OF THERE.

00:36:17.608 --> 00:36:20.611
GENERAL FUND- WILL HELP AS WELL

00:36:20.678 --> 00:36:21.579

JUST GOING HISTORICALLY WEAK WE

00:36:32.690 --> 00:36:33.925
KEEP REFERRING TO THE POTENTIAL

00:36:33.991 --> 00:36:35.993
OF A RECESSION. AND WHEN WE

00:36:36.060 --> 00:36:37.762
WENT THROUGH. OTHER

00:36:37.828 --> 00:36:39.130
RECESSIONARY PERIODS LIKE THE

00:36:39.196 --> 00:36:40.531
GREAT RECESSION THE STATE. HAD

00:36:40.598 --> 00:36:42.300
A HABIT OF TAKING MONEY FROM

00:36:42.366 --> 00:36:45.002
LOCAL- CITIES AND COUNTIES.

00:36:45.069 --> 00:36:46.504
KIND OF A DYSFUNCTIONAL HABIT

00:36:46.571 --> 00:36:47.838
BUT THAT'S JUST HOW IT HAPPENED

00:36:47.905 --> 00:36:49.740
THROUGH. EITHER TAKING OF FUNDS

00:36:49.807 --> 00:36:52.276

00:37:05.723 --> 00:37:06.223
YEARS AGO DURING THE GREAT

00:37:06.290 --> 00:37:08.159
RECESSION. YOU'RE TALKING

00:37:08.225 --> 00:37:09.627
SPECIFICALLY ABOUT BORROWING

00:37:09.694 --> 00:37:11.562
FROM CITIES AND COUNTIES RIGHT

00:37:11.629 --> 00:37:14.432
YES SO- I WILL NEED TO DOUBLE

00:37:14.498 --> 00:37:15.733
THAT DEBT REPAYMENTS THAT

00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:17.234
OCCURRED OVER THE LAST SEVERAL

00:37:17.301 --> 00:37:18.603
YEARS WITH THE WALL JACK

00:37:18.669 --> 00:37:19.503
INCLUDING IN LAST YEAR'S

00:37:19.570 --> 00:37:21.606

THIS. STUDY THAT THE DEFINITION

00:37:37.188 --> 00:37:40.124
OF WHAT A SURPLUS IS AND SO I

00:37:40.191 --> 00:37:41.993
JUST KIND OF LOOKING AT

00:37:42.059 --> 00:37:44.028
SACRAMENTO ON THEM LOOKING AT

00:37:44.095 --> 00:37:47.598
ALL THE CITIES AND COUNTIES.

00:37:47.665 --> 00:37:50.501
THEY HAVE ISSUES OF DEBT- THAT

00:37:50.568 --> 00:37:54.705
NEED TO BE ADDRESSED AND- HE IT

00:37:54.772 --> 00:37:56.340
WAS SORT OF MENTIONED IN TRYING

00:37:56.407 --> 00:37:57.908
TO DO MORE IN YOUR OTHER

00:37:57.975 --> 00:38:00.578
REPORTS. FOR SCHOOLS WERE

00:38:00.645 --> 00:38:02.079
ACTUALLY FOR THE STATE IN

00:38:02.146 --> 00:38:03.447
SCHOOLS TO PUT MORE MONEY IN

00:38:03.514 --> 00:38:05.549
THE PENSION PLANS SO I WAS JUST

00:38:05.616 --> 00:38:06.817
WONDERING IS AS THE STATE

00:38:06.884 --> 00:38:10.588
ENJOYS A- SURPLUS. WHY DON'T WE

00:38:10.655 --> 00:38:12.957
HAVE LIKE A AN ALLOCATION TO

00:38:13.024 --> 00:38:15.760
CITIES AND COUNTIES. AND THEN.

00:38:15.826 --> 00:38:17.762
REQUIRE THAT THEY GET OF THEIR

00:38:17.828 --> 00:38:19.063
RESPECTIVE SHARE BASED ON A

00:38:19.130 --> 00:38:21.032
FORMULA POPULATION OR WHATEVER

00:38:21.098 --> 00:38:22.299
AND THEN THAT MONEY JUST GOES

00:38:22.366 --> 00:38:24.301
INTO THEIR PENSION PLAN SO THAT

00:38:24.368 --> 00:38:25.770
IN GOOD TIMES WERE SORT OF

00:38:25.836 --> 00:38:27.171
HELPING OUT CITIES AND COUNTIES

00:38:27.238 --> 00:38:28.472
SO THAT. WE ACTUALLY HAVE THE

00:38:28.539 --> 00:38:30.908
RIGHT TO COME TO THEM IN BAD

00:38:30.975 --> 00:38:33.611
TIMES. IF WE NEED. SOME KIND OF

00:38:33.678 --> 00:38:35.479
CASH TO GET THROUGH A RECESSION

00:38:35.546 --> 00:38:38.215
BECAUSE OUR- TAXING SYSTEM IS

00:38:38.282 --> 00:38:39.417
MUCH MORE VOLATILE THAN A

00:38:39.483 --> 00:38:45.856
PROPERTY TAX SYSTEM. RESERVE

00:38:45.923 --> 00:38:46.991
YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT WHY AREN'T

00:38:47.058 --> 00:38:49.560
WE- BECAUSE IT IT SEEMS LIKE

00:38:49.627 --> 00:38:50.461
THE STATE IS TALKING SURPLUS

00:38:50.528 --> 00:38:52.863
AND CITIES. ARE ARE TALKING

00:38:52.930 --> 00:38:54.765
FINANCIAL SCARCITY I MEAN WE'VE

00:38:54.832 --> 00:38:56.834
WE HAD A BILL THAT ASKS FOR

00:38:56.901 --> 00:38:58.202
EMERYVILLE IN SCOTTS VALLEY TO

00:38:58.269 --> 00:38:59.503
INCREASE THEIR SALES TAX WHICH

00:38:59.570 --> 00:39:02.139
THE GOVERNOR VETOED BUT- THOSE

00:39:02.206 --> 00:39:05.142
CITIES OUR MESSAGING. SOME AND

00:39:05.209 --> 00:39:06.977
WE GOT A BUT YOU KNOW HOW DO WE

00:39:07.044 --> 00:39:08.479
HELP OUT. I'LL MAKE A COUPLE

00:39:08.546 --> 00:39:09.780
COMMENTS AND I KNOW I WAY I MAY

00:39:09.847 --> 00:39:11.482
HAVE SOME AS WELL I THINK FIRST

00:39:11.549 --> 00:39:13.984
IS THAT- WITH THE SURPLUS BOTH

00:39:14.051 --> 00:39:16.087
LAST YEAR AND THIS YEAR- THERE

00:39:16.153 --> 00:39:18.089
CERTAINLY WAS. IN ADDITION TO

00:39:18.155 --> 00:39:19.724
THE CONSTITUTIONAL AND

00:39:19.790 --> 00:39:21.559
GOVERNANCE OF RELATIONS BETWEEN

00:39:21.625 --> 00:39:22.426
THE STATE AND CITIES AND

00:39:22.493 --> 00:39:24.095
COUNTIES- WITH REGARD TO

00:39:24.161 --> 00:39:25.563
REALIGNMENT THAT YOU MENTIONED

00:39:25.629 --> 00:39:26.597
THERE WAS AN ADDITIONAL MONEY

00:39:26.664 --> 00:39:27.598
IN THE BUDGET THAT FLOW

00:39:27.665 --> 00:39:29.433
DIRECTLY TO CITIES AND COUNTIES

00:39:29.500 --> 00:39:31.068
IN SPECIFICALLY. ON THE ISSUE

00:39:31.135 --> 00:39:32.169
OF HOMELESSNESS ALONE IN THE

00:39:32.236 --> 00:39:34.338
LAST TWO YEARS OVER ONE POINT

00:39:34.405 --> 00:39:35.706
ONE BILLION DOLLARS. WENT

00:39:35.773 --> 00:39:37.675
SPECIFICALLY TO CITIES COUNTIES

00:39:37.742 --> 00:39:39.710
IN CONTINUUM'S OF CARE FOR

00:39:39.777 --> 00:39:41.178
THESE TYPES OF SERVICES SO YOU

00:39:41.245 --> 00:39:42.580
KNOW WHAT OBVIOUSLY THIS IS A

00:39:42.646 --> 00:39:44.348
SHARED PRIORITY AND WE HOPE

00:39:44.415 --> 00:39:45.216
THAT THAT WILL PROVIDE SOME

00:39:45.282 --> 00:39:46.684
RELIEF BECAUSE WE UNDERSTAND

00:39:46.751 --> 00:39:47.685
THE PRESSURE THAT LOCALITIES

00:39:47.752 --> 00:39:49.754
ARE UNDER. ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF

00:39:49.820 --> 00:39:51.822
THAT IS ON LAST YEAR'S BUDGET

00:39:51.889 --> 00:39:54.191
OR- THAT COUNTY I AM- WE FOR

00:39:54.258 --> 00:39:56.460
AYE HSS- AND THAT WAS A RE

00:39:56.527 --> 00:39:57.728
NEGOTIATION WITH THE STATE AND

00:39:57.795 --> 00:39:58.996
CITIES AND COUNTIES IN THE

00:39:59.063 --> 00:40:01.098
STATE IS PUTTING AND- SEVERAL

00:40:01.165 --> 00:40:02.233
HUNDRED EXTRA MILLION DOLLARS

00:40:02.299 --> 00:40:03.334
IN ADDITIONAL AND THAT SHOULD

00:40:03.400 --> 00:40:04.735
PROVIDE SOME RELIEF. AS WELL

00:40:04.802 --> 00:40:05.770
FOR A PROGRAM WHERE WE KNOW

00:40:05.836 --> 00:40:08.572
WE'RE FACING. RISING COSTS- BUT

00:40:08.639 --> 00:40:09.707
ON THE BROADER ISSUE OF THE

00:40:09.774 --> 00:40:12.576
SURPLUS- THE STATE OF COURSE-

00:40:12.643 --> 00:40:13.778
HAS THIS RELATIONSHIP WITH THE

00:40:13.844 --> 00:40:14.779
CITIES AND COUNTIES BUT THE

00:40:14.845 --> 00:40:16.814
STATE AS YOU KNOW ALSO HAS ITS

00:40:16.881 --> 00:40:19.016
OWN OBLIGATIONS AND THAT WE

00:40:19.083 --> 00:40:20.518
KNOW WHAT OUR PENSION AND

00:40:20.584 --> 00:40:21.252
RETIREE HEALTH CARE

00:40:21.318 --> 00:40:22.853
OBLIGATIONS. WE NEED TO PUT MY

00:40:22.920 --> 00:40:23.821
AS WELL IT'S WHERE THOSE

00:40:23.888 --> 00:40:25.556
OPTIONS AT THE STATE ITSELF IS

00:40:25.623 --> 00:40:26.757
ON THE HOOK FOR AND SO THAT'S

00:40:26.824 --> 00:40:28.926
WHAT WE DID- A GREAT DEAL ON A

00:40:28.993 --> 00:40:31.462
LAST YEAR'S ENACTED BUDGET. BUT

00:40:31.529 --> 00:40:32.196
WE KNOW THAT WE HAVE A LONG WAY

00:40:32.263 --> 00:40:33.497
TO GO SO FAR TO THE EXTENT THAT

00:40:33.564 --> 00:40:34.331
WE HAVE DISCRETIONARY

00:40:34.398 --> 00:40:36.300
RESOURCES- FOR THE STATE'S

00:40:36.367 --> 00:40:38.903
SURPLUS- IT'S ONLY- RIGHT I

00:40:38.969 --> 00:40:39.837
THINK IS THE ADMINISTRATION'S

00:40:39.904 --> 00:40:41.472
POSITION. THAT THAT MONEY GO TO

00:40:41.539 --> 00:40:43.107
WORK STATE UNFUNDED OBLIGATIONS

00:40:43.174 --> 00:40:45.276
FIRST. IN THE U. BROUGHT UP

00:40:45.342 --> 00:40:46.410
ALMOST AS AND THAT'S WHERE

00:40:46.477 --> 00:40:47.978
WHERE TO GO NEXT AND THAT'S

00:40:48.045 --> 00:40:48.479
WHERE I DO SEE THE STATE

00:40:48.546 --> 00:40:51.215
HELPING. CITIES AND COUNTIES-

00:40:51.282 --> 00:40:53.584
BUT IT SEEMS SILO TO ME SO

00:40:53.651 --> 00:40:55.653
WE'VE GOT ONE PROGRAM FROM LAST

00:40:55.719 --> 00:40:57.988
YEAR NEW PROGRAM FROM THIS YEAR

00:40:58.055 --> 00:40:59.890
WE HAVE PROPOSITION TWO. WHICH

00:40:59.957 --> 00:41:07.565
PROVIDES THE NO PLACE LIKE HOME.

00:41:07.631 --> 00:41:09.066
IN A FUNDING AND- WE'VE HAD A

00:41:09.133 --> 00:41:10.267
YEAR NOW SINCE. MEASURE PASS.

00:41:10.334 --> 00:41:10.901
HOW ARE WE DOING ON GRANT FOR.

00:41:10.968 --> 00:41:12.736
HOW COUNTY. DOING AND WHAT MY

00:41:12.803 --> 00:41:14.104
HAS BEEN TO. DISCUSS YES ALL

00:41:14.171 --> 00:41:16.407
FIRST ABOUT JAY. GOV AND IN

00:41:16.473 --> 00:41:17.241
TERMS OF THE FUNDING

00:41:17.308 --> 00:41:19.043
SPECIFICALLY SO. FOR

00:41:19.109 --> 00:41:20.544
GOVERNANCE- THIS IS BEEN A

00:41:20.611 --> 00:41:21.579
PRIORITY SINCE THE GOVERNOR

00:41:21.645 --> 00:41:23.013
TOOK OFFICE BUT EVEN IN THE

00:41:23.080 --> 00:41:24.782
LAST COUPLE WEEKS AND MONTHS.

00:41:24.849 --> 00:41:26.050
YOU'RE SEEING THAT MINISTRATION

00:41:26.116 --> 00:41:27.618
FURTHER STEP UP IN THIS AREA SO

00:41:27.685 --> 00:41:29.486
THE GOVERNOR. HAS APPOINTED AND

00:41:29.553 --> 00:41:31.222
HIS OFFICE IS SENIOR COUNSELOR

00:41:31.288 --> 00:41:32.690
SPECIFICALLY ON HOUSING AND

00:41:32.756 --> 00:41:34.859
HOMELESSNESS. HE SAID ONLY HALF

00:41:34.925 --> 00:41:36.227
JOKINGLY DURING HIS OWN BUDGET

00:41:36.293 --> 00:41:37.027
PRESS CONFERENCE THAT HE

00:41:37.094 --> 00:41:38.295
HIMSELF WAS THE HOMELESSNESS

00:41:38.362 --> 00:41:39.930
ARE. ON AND THEN HE SIGNALED

00:41:39.997 --> 00:41:41.565
THE AND THE GUY AND- BUDGET

00:41:41.632 --> 00:41:42.867
EIGHT PAGES THAT YOU'D LIKE TO

00:41:42.933 --> 00:41:43.734
EXPLORE THE CREATION OF A

00:41:43.801 --> 00:41:44.802
HOUSING HOMELESSNESS.

00:41:44.869 --> 00:41:46.570
DEPARTMENT OR AGENCY- TO

00:41:46.637 --> 00:41:48.205
FURTHER A LINE THESE EFFORTS-

00:41:48.272 --> 00:41:50.274
SO THERE IS A REAL FOCUS ON

00:41:50.341 --> 00:41:52.076
MAKING SURE NOT ONLY THAT WERE.

00:41:52.142 --> 00:41:53.310
INVESTING THE RESOURCES THAT

00:41:53.377 --> 00:41:54.578
ARE REQUIRED. BUT THAT THESE

00:41:54.645 --> 00:41:55.880
INVESTMENTS ARE INTEGRATED

00:41:55.946 --> 00:41:57.181
ACROSS THE DIFFERENT AGENCIES

00:41:57.248 --> 00:41:58.449
AND DEPARTMENTS OF THE STATE.

00:41:58.515 --> 00:41:59.283
THAT ARE DEALING WITH THIS AND

00:41:59.350 --> 00:42:00.751
THIS SPECIFICALLY IS A

00:42:00.818 --> 00:42:03.554
PRIORITY. OF OUR HHS PROPOSAL

00:42:03.621 --> 00:42:04.555
AND OF COURSE A LOT OF OUR

00:42:04.622 --> 00:42:05.756
HOMELESSNESS EFFORTS. ARE

00:42:05.823 --> 00:42:07.258
WITHIN THE BUSINESS CONSUMER

00:42:07.324 --> 00:42:08.726
SERVICES AND HOUSING AGENCY.

00:42:08.792 --> 00:42:10.294
BUT AS WE NOW- PEOPLE WHO ARE

00:42:10.361 --> 00:42:11.795
EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS ARE

00:42:11.862 --> 00:42:12.897
OFTEN EXPERIENCING HEALTH

00:42:12.963 --> 00:42:14.598
CHALLENGES BEHAVIORAL HEALTH

00:42:14.665 --> 00:42:15.599
CHALLENGES. SO IT'S ACTUALLY

00:42:15.666 --> 00:42:17.167
VERY IMPORTANT THAT ANYTHING WE

00:42:17.234 --> 00:42:18.669
DO IN THE HHS SPACES ALSO

00:42:18.736 --> 00:42:20.671
COORDINATED. SO THAT'S ON THE

00:42:20.738 --> 00:42:21.739
GOVERNMENT SIDE WHEN IT COMES

00:42:21.805 --> 00:42:23.040
TO PACIFIC WHICH TO THE

00:42:23.107 --> 00:42:26.143
FUNDING. AT THE GOVERNOR- IS-

00:42:26.210 --> 00:42:27.344
BELIEVES THAT THAT MONEY THAT

00:42:27.411 --> 00:42:28.512
NOW OVER BILLION DOLLARS OVER

00:42:28.579 --> 00:42:31.015
THE LAST TWO YEARS. THE FIRST

00:42:31.081 --> 00:42:31.582
FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR

00:42:31.649 --> 00:42:34.051
CHARGE WAS TO BUDGET AX AGO.

00:42:34.118 --> 00:42:35.119
AND THEN THE SIX HUNDRED FIFTY

00:42:35.185 --> 00:42:36.320
NINE THE- TIME FROM LAST YEAR

00:42:36.387 --> 00:42:37.254
THAT IS ACT. IT'S GOING OUT

00:42:37.321 --> 00:42:39.356
RIGHT NOW. ON AND I KNOW CAN BE

00:42:39.423 --> 00:42:41.191
FRUSTRATING WHEN IT TAKES A

00:42:41.258 --> 00:42:42.359
COUPLE MONTHS FOR THE MONEY TO

00:42:42.426 --> 00:42:43.360
GO OUT. I WANT TO MAKE SURE

00:42:43.427 --> 00:42:44.862
THAT IT IS GOING TO THE RIGHT

00:42:44.929 --> 00:42:46.664
AND TO BE THE- PLANS IN PLACE.

00:42:46.730 --> 00:42:48.532
TO I IT CAN THANK EFFECTIVELY.

00:42:48.599 --> 00:42:50.067
BECAUSE THE ADVOCACY OF THAT

00:42:50.134 --> 00:42:53.771
SPENDING IS KEEN READING OF

00:42:53.837 --> 00:42:54.571
WHETHER WE DECIDE TO INVEST

00:42:54.638 --> 00:43:01.645
FURTHER SOURCES. IN THE FUTURE.

00:43:01.712 --> 00:43:02.379
HE'S GOING TO SEE AND COUNTIES

00:43:02.446 --> 00:43:04.481
THE- TAX ARE MONTH THAT'S A

00:43:04.548 --> 00:43:05.082
SEVEN FIFTY NINE TO. IN TERMS

00:43:05.149 --> 00:43:06.483
OF THE NO PLACE LIKE HOME. THAT

00:43:06.550 --> 00:43:07.117
FINISHED AT THE UNITED THAT WAS

00:43:07.184 --> 00:43:07.651
APPROVED BY THE VOTERS I

00:43:07.718 --> 00:43:08.519
BELIEVE THE FIRST TRY CHAT HAS

00:43:08.585 --> 00:43:09.486
GONE OUT A RISK. OUT AND THERE

00:43:09.553 --> 00:43:10.688
IS NO OF FUNDING AVAILABLE. FOR

00:43:10.754 --> 00:43:11.722
THE SECOND CRUNCH OF THAT AND

00:43:11.789 --> 00:43:12.823
MY COLLEAGUE CHRIS CAN ALSO

00:43:12.890 --> 00:43:14.992
SPEAK. TO THAT- THAT THAT'S

00:43:15.059 --> 00:43:16.427
ALSO A PLACE WHERE WE WANT TO

00:43:16.493 --> 00:43:17.561
GET THOSE RESOURCES OUT BUT

00:43:17.628 --> 00:43:18.829
AGAIN WE DON'T WANT TO SPEND IT

00:43:18.896 --> 00:43:20.731
ALL IN ONE SHOT. BEFORE PEOPLE

00:43:20.798 --> 00:43:22.066
ARE READY AND WE GET A SENSE OF

00:43:22.132 --> 00:43:23.701
HOW TO MOST EFFECTIVELY SPEND

00:43:23.767 --> 00:43:25.302
IT AND WHAT WORKS. AND THEN THE

00:43:25.369 --> 00:43:26.437
FINAL POINT THAT'LL MAKE IS

00:43:26.503 --> 00:43:27.037
WHEN IT COMES TO THIS

00:43:27.104 --> 00:43:28.839
CALIFORNIA. HOUSE ACCESS TO

00:43:28.906 --> 00:43:30.074
HOUSING AND SERVICES FUND WHICH

00:43:30.140 --> 00:43:31.508
THAT YOU'RE MENTIONED IN HER

00:43:31.575 --> 00:43:33.077
OPENING. REMARKS THIS IS

00:43:33.143 --> 00:43:34.445
DESIGNED TO SUPPLEMENT AND NOT

00:43:34.511 --> 00:43:35.980
SUPPLANT THE EFFORTS THAT ARE

00:43:36.046 --> 00:43:37.348
GOING ON AT THE CITY AND COUNTY

00:43:37.414 --> 00:43:39.783
LEVELS SO. WHILE THAT SIX

00:43:39.850 --> 00:43:40.417
HUNDRED FIFTY NINE DOLLARS FROM

00:43:40.484 --> 00:43:41.752
LAST YEAR'S PROJECT IS GOING

00:43:41.819 --> 00:43:43.320
OUT. WE'RE ALSO PROPOSING WITH

00:43:43.387 --> 00:43:44.888
THIS FUND AND WE'RE HOPING FOR

00:43:44.955 --> 00:43:46.190
EARLY ACTION ALTHOUGH WE KNOW

00:43:46.256 --> 00:43:47.157
THAT WILL BE A CONVERSATION

00:43:47.224 --> 00:43:48.192
WITH ALL OF YOU. IN THE

00:43:48.258 --> 00:43:49.827
LEGISLATURE. THAT THAT WE'LL

00:43:49.893 --> 00:43:51.028
GET TO THESE OTHER PRIORITIES

00:43:51.095 --> 00:43:52.162
IN CONCERT WITH CITIES AND

00:43:52.229 --> 00:43:53.464
COUNTIES SPECIFICALLY FOR

00:43:53.530 --> 00:43:54.598
STABILIZING THESE PORTENT CRE

00:43:54.665 --> 00:43:56.767
HOMES WHICH WE ALL KNOW. FROM

00:43:56.834 --> 00:43:58.035
EXPERIENCE ARE FROM READING

00:43:58.102 --> 00:43:59.303
NEWS COVERAGE ARE AT RISK AND

00:43:59.370 --> 00:44:00.771
DO NEED TO BE STABILIZED. WE

00:44:00.838 --> 00:44:02.106
NEED MORE FLEXIBLE NIMBLE

00:44:02.172 --> 00:44:03.440
APPROACH FOR GETTING RENTAL

00:44:03.507 --> 00:44:04.808
SUBSIDIES TO PEOPLE WHO NEED

00:44:04.875 --> 00:44:06.377
THEM. AND THERE'S MORE THAT WE

00:44:06.443 --> 00:44:07.211
CAN DO ON DEVELOPING AFFORDABLE

00:44:07.277 --> 00:44:08.979
HOUSING UNITS AND NOT SIMPLY

00:44:09.046 --> 00:44:13.584
TAKING. A STATE YOU KNOW. OUCH

00:44:13.650 --> 00:44:14.184
WHERE IT'S ONE SIZE FITS ALL.

00:44:14.251 --> 00:44:14.785
BUT AT THIS. TIME NOT LETTING

00:44:14.852 --> 00:44:16.086
EVERY. ASSN CITY ITS OWN THING

00:44:16.153 --> 00:44:16.787
WITHOUT ANY SORT OF

00:44:16.854 --> 00:44:18.288
ACCOUNTABILITY. SO WE ARE

00:44:18.355 --> 00:44:19.256
PROPOSING A REGIONAL

00:44:19.323 --> 00:44:21.258
ADMINISTRATOR MODEL. LOOKING AT

00:44:21.325 --> 00:44:22.593
BEST PRACTICES IN BUILDING AND

00:44:22.659 --> 00:44:23.627
ACCOUNTABILITY INTO THAT

00:44:23.694 --> 00:44:25.062
SYSTEM. AND I THINK WHEN YOU

00:44:25.129 --> 00:44:26.830
PUT ALL THESE THINGS TOGETHER.

00:44:26.897 --> 00:44:28.232
THIS IS NOT A CHALLENGE THAT

00:44:28.298 --> 00:44:29.566
CAN BE SOLVED IN ONE YEAR OR

00:44:29.633 --> 00:44:31.301
TWO YEARS. BUT WE HOPE THAT NOT

00:44:31.368 --> 00:44:32.236
ONLY THIS INVESTMENT OF

00:44:32.302 --> 00:44:33.837
RESOURCES BUT HOW IT'S A WIND

00:44:33.904 --> 00:44:34.571
AND HOW THE GOVERNANCE

00:44:34.638 --> 00:44:37.007
STRUCTURE IS. WILL MAKE SURE

00:44:37.074 --> 00:44:37.574
THAT WE'RE GETTING THE BEST

00:44:37.641 --> 00:44:39.877
RETURN ON OUR INVESTMENT. IN

00:44:39.943 --> 00:44:42.279
SENATOR MORE LIKE. YOU KNOW WE

00:44:42.346 --> 00:44:44.248
ALSO HAVE SOME THOUGHTS OR

00:44:44.314 --> 00:44:46.617
QUESTIONS ABOUT THE PROPOSAL-

00:44:46.683 --> 00:44:47.851
IN PARTICULAR WITH REGARD TO

00:44:47.918 --> 00:44:51.321
HOMELESSNESS- YOU KNOW THE-

00:44:51.388 --> 00:44:52.056
ONE. WOULD YOU THE QUESTION

00:44:52.122 --> 00:44:54.124
ABOUT RESOURCES FOR CITIES. WE

00:44:54.191 --> 00:44:55.826
NOTED THAT IN THE PRESS IN THE

00:44:55.893 --> 00:44:57.895
CURRENT YEAR BUDGET. THERE WERE

00:44:57.961 --> 00:44:59.797
RESOURCES GIVEN DIRECTLY TO THE

00:44:59.863 --> 00:45:01.265
CITIES BUT IN THE CURRENT

00:45:01.331 --> 00:45:03.033
BUDGET PROPOSAL BEFORE US THERE

00:45:03.100 --> 00:45:05.035
IS A SHIFT A CHANGE IN THE WAY

00:45:05.102 --> 00:45:06.737
THAT THE- HOMELESSNESS DOLLARS

00:45:06.804 --> 00:45:08.238
ARE ADMINISTERED AND WE DO

00:45:08.305 --> 00:45:09.740
THINK THAT THERE ARE SOME.

00:45:09.807 --> 00:45:11.341
REASONABLE QUESTIONS ABOUT. YOU

00:45:11.408 --> 00:45:12.743

00:45:12.810 --> 00:45:14.078
THE WHAT KIND OF INFORMATION

00:45:14.144 --> 00:45:16.380
LED TO THAT SORT OF CHANGE. AND

00:45:16.447 --> 00:45:18.916
WHY. CHANNELING THOSE INTO THE

VERSES THAT THE PRIOR MODEL.

00:45:22.419 --> 00:45:23.754
AND SO THOSE ARE THE KINDS OF

00:45:23.821 --> 00:45:25.022
QUESTIONS WE THINK ARE

00:45:25.089 --> 00:45:27.591
PROBABLY- PRODUCTIVE FOR THE

00:45:27.658 --> 00:45:29.126
LEGISLATURE TO FIND OUT

00:45:29.193 --> 00:45:30.961

FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS WAS

00:47:24.741 --> 00:47:26.009
SUPPOSED TO BE PUT INTO THIS

00:47:26.076 --> 00:47:27.477
PROGRAM AND IT'S NOW BEEN

00:47:27.544 --> 00:47:29.713
REDUCED TO TWENTY FIVE MILLION.

00:47:29.780 --> 00:47:31.281
WHICH FOR SOMEONE LIKE ME WHO'S

GAS EMISSIONS. HOW TO READ WE

00:47:40.557 --> 00:47:42.192
REDUCES PARTICULATES JUST

00:47:42.259 --> 00:47:44.861
CURIOUS WHY IT WAS CUT FROM

FIFTY TO TWENTY FIVE. YES SO TO

00:47:47.197 --> 00:47:48.799
ON THIS ISSUE ONE BE VERY CLEAR

00:47:48.865 --> 00:47:50.067
THAT THE ADMINISTRATION DOES

00:47:50.133 --> 00:47:51.902
THINKING COMMITTEE- PROTECTION

00:47:51.969 --> 00:47:54.037
IS A KEY PRIORITY- AND SAID

00:47:54.104 --> 00:47:55.839
THIS WAS. NOTHING TO DO WITH ME

00:47:55.906 --> 00:47:57.307
EVERY ACTION BEING LESSEN

00:47:57.374 --> 00:47:58.342
PRIORITY AND MUCH MORE THE FACT

00:47:58.408 --> 00:48:00.077
THAT OVERALL FUNDING FOR CAP

00:48:00.143 --> 00:48:02.746
AND TRADE. IS NOT WHAT WE WE'RE

00:48:02.813 --> 00:48:03.947
NOT PROJECTING IT AT A LEVEL

00:48:04.014 --> 00:48:05.215
THIS YEAR WHAT WE PRINT WHAT WE

00:48:05.282 --> 00:48:06.917
HAD FOR LAST YEAR SO SOME OF

00:48:06.984 --> 00:48:08.885
THE PROGRAMS IN CAP AND TRADE.

00:48:08.952 --> 00:48:09.987
HOW TO TAKE THEIR CUT OR EVEN

00:48:10.053 --> 00:48:11.121
BEING BROUGHT DOWN SEEN

00:48:11.188 --> 00:48:12.556
SIGNIFICANTLY MORE THAN THAT-

00:48:12.623 --> 00:48:15.058
AND SO WE'RE HOPING THAT COME A

00:48:15.125 --> 00:48:16.627
OR YOU KNOW THROUGH THE BUDGET

00:48:16.693 --> 00:48:17.995
PROCESS WILL GET A BETTER SENSE

00:48:18.061 --> 00:48:19.196
OF HOW OUR- TEAM CAP AND TRADE

00:48:19.263 --> 00:48:20.664
REVENUES EVERY YEAR TO CALM

00:48:20.731 --> 00:48:22.366
AND- IF THEY DO INCREASED AND

00:48:22.432 --> 00:48:23.567
WE'LL HAVE. MORE RESOURCES TO

00:48:23.634 --> 00:48:25.802
PUT INTO POSSIBLY BASE AS WELL

00:48:25.869 --> 00:48:26.837
AS OTHER PROGRAMS THAT TOOK A

00:48:26.903 --> 00:48:28.605
HAIR CUT. BUT THAT'S THE REASON

00:48:28.672 --> 00:48:29.640
FOR IT NOT ANY DEITIES IS ON

00:48:29.706 --> 00:48:31.842
THE- OF THAT PROGRAM OKAY SO

00:48:31.908 --> 00:48:33.877
JUST PUT A PLUG FOR. WHEN

00:48:33.944 --> 00:48:36.947
THEY'RE MORE MY REACT. THAT

00:48:37.014 --> 00:48:40.050
BACKS SO WE HAVE THE MILLION I

00:48:40.117 --> 00:48:45.188
THERE'S- A THAT OUT. TO THAT IS

00:48:45.255 --> 00:48:47.124

00:51:13.603 --> 00:51:15.939
CURRENTLY USED- AND THE THREE

00:51:16.006 --> 00:51:17.340
RULING EVER TO HELP KIND OF.

THE FUNDING- AND THEN THE FUN

00:51:23.814 --> 00:51:24.481
WOULD STILL GO THROUGH

00:51:24.548 --> 00:51:26.716
SELFLESS- BUT THE BASE RATE

00:51:26.783 --> 00:51:27.851
WOULD BE INCREASE FOR THE VAST

00:51:27.918 --> 00:51:29.219
MAJORITY OF SCHOOL DISTRICTS

00:51:29.286 --> 00:51:30.187
BECAUSE WHAT WE'RE DOING IS

00:51:30.253 --> 00:51:32.088
TAKING THAT SIX HUNDRED AND

00:51:32.155 --> 00:51:32.656
FORTY FIVE MILLION THAT WE

00:51:32.722 --> 00:51:33.957
PROVIDED LAST YEAR. AND RULING

00:51:34.024 --> 00:51:35.859
THAT INTO THE NEW BASE RATE. IN

00:51:35.926 --> 00:51:36.893
ADDITION THE TUNER FIFTY

00:51:36.960 --> 00:51:38.595
MILLION THAT- MISTER MISTER NOT

00:51:38.662 --> 00:51:42.566

THANK YOU VERY MUCH- AND

00:51:47.838 --> 00:51:49.206
ACCOUNTABILITY HOW DO HOW WILL

00:51:49.272 --> 00:51:50.707
WE MAKE SURE THAT DISTRICTS ARE

00:51:50.774 --> 00:51:52.676
DOING WHAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO

00:51:52.742 --> 00:51:54.778
BE DOING WITH THE MONEY. THAT'S

00:51:54.845 --> 00:51:57.147
AN EXCELLENT QUESTION- ED I

00:51:57.214 --> 00:51:58.782
THINK ONE OF THE KEY ISSUES

00:51:58.849 --> 00:52:00.250
THAT FOLKS ABOUT UP TO US-

00:52:00.317 --> 00:52:01.451
WE'VE BEEN TALKING WITH PEOPLE

00:52:01.518 --> 00:52:02.519
IN THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS ABOUT

00:52:02.586 --> 00:52:03.854
SOCIAL EDUCATION IS THE FACT

00:52:03.920 --> 00:52:04.788
THAT WE HOLD SCHOOL DISTRICTS

00:52:04.855 --> 00:52:07.357
ACCOUNTABLE- FOR THEIR STUDENT

00:52:07.424 --> 00:52:09.559
OUTCOMES IN SPECIAL EDUCATION-

00:52:09.626 --> 00:52:10.760
BUT THE FUNDING DECISIONS ARE

00:52:10.827 --> 00:52:12.429
MADE AT THE TOP LEVEL. AND SO

00:52:12.496 --> 00:52:14.664
WE ARE PROPOSING- AN ADDITIONAL

00:52:14.731 --> 00:52:16.800
AUGMENTATION OF A FEW HUNDRED

00:52:16.867 --> 00:52:17.634

GOVERNANCE- FOR SPECIAL

00:52:22.772 --> 00:52:26.943

00:52:27.010 --> 00:52:28.478
TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND- FISCAL

00:52:28.545 --> 00:52:30.914
YEAR- TO PROVIDE US WITH SOME

00:52:30.981 --> 00:52:32.249
RECOMMENDATIONS ABOUT HOW WE

00:52:32.315 --> 00:52:33.083
CAN IMPROVE AND STRENGTHEN THE

00:52:33.149 --> 00:52:35.285
ACCOUNTABILITY- AROUND. THE

00:52:35.352 --> 00:52:36.520
SPECIAL EDUCATION OUTCOMES AND

00:52:36.586 --> 00:52:38.455
USE OF FUNDS- AS YOU MOVE

00:52:38.522 --> 00:52:40.557
FORWARD. THAT SOUNDS GREAT IF I

00:52:40.624 --> 00:52:41.224
CAN BE HELPFUL IN ANY WAY

00:52:41.291 --> 00:52:43.260
PLEASE LET ME KNOW ONE LAST

00:52:43.326 --> 00:52:46.296
QUESTION. DID I READ CORRECTLY

THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE A NEW.

00:52:49.466 --> 00:52:52.536
CHILD CARE. ORGANIZATION

00:52:52.602 --> 00:52:54.437
COMMITTEE ALSO THERE IS A NEW

00:52:54.504 --> 00:52:55.906
DEPARTMENT OF EARLY.

00:52:55.972 --> 00:52:57.574
DEVELOPMENT OKAY YES AND THAT

00:52:57.641 --> 00:53:00.010
WOULD BE WITHIN HHS AGENCY AND

00:53:00.076 --> 00:53:01.177
BASICALLY RESULTED FROM THE

00:53:01.244 --> 00:53:02.445
SENSE THAT SOME OF THESE

00:53:02.512 --> 00:53:03.947
DEPARTMENTS WERE SCATTERED OR

00:53:04.014 --> 00:53:05.181
IN DIFFERENT PLACES SO WE WANT

00:53:05.248 --> 00:53:06.950
TO BRING. MOST OF THOSE CHILD

00:53:07.017 --> 00:53:09.052
CARE FUNCTIONS UNDER ONE ROOF

00:53:09.119 --> 00:53:10.654
AND THE EIGHT POINT FIVE

00:53:10.720 --> 00:53:11.388
MILLION WILL BE SPENT FOR THAT

00:53:11.454 --> 00:53:13.423
DEPARTMENT I BELIEVE SO YES I

00:53:13.490 --> 00:53:14.324
CAN DOUBLE CHECK THE FIGURE BUT

00:53:14.391 --> 00:53:15.725

DEPARTMENTS ARE GREAT AND MUCH

00:53:19.996 --> 00:53:22.232
NEEDED BUT I WONDER IF THAT

00:53:22.299 --> 00:53:23.066
EIGHT POINT FIVE MILLION COULD

00:53:23.133 --> 00:53:25.769
BE BETTER SPENT- FIXING THE

00:53:25.835 --> 00:53:26.603
DEPARTMENT WE ALREADY HAVE I

00:53:26.670 --> 00:53:28.505
DON'T KNOW- BUT I JUST WANT TO

00:53:28.572 --> 00:53:29.773
BE CAUTIOUS THAT WE'RE NOT

00:53:29.839 --> 00:53:32.342
SPENDING MONEY. THAT THEY COULD

00:53:32.409 --> 00:53:34.377
MAKE THE DEPARTMENT BETTER AND

00:53:34.444 --> 00:53:35.378
THEN WE'RE CREATING ANOTHER

00:53:35.445 --> 00:53:37.180
BUREAUCRACY SELF JUST A

00:53:37.247 --> 00:53:38.782

PRESCHOOL. IS ONE YEAR- AND AS

00:54:03.506 --> 00:54:06.376
WE KNOW INFANT CARE IS PREMIUM-

00:54:06.443 --> 00:54:07.577
IT'S THE MOST EXPENSIVE AND

00:54:07.644 --> 00:54:08.712
HARDEST TO FIND ACROSS THE

00:54:08.778 --> 00:54:11.348
STATE. AND SO IN THE INTENTION

00:54:11.414 --> 00:54:12.482

00:54:33.937 --> 00:54:36.072
OF SLOTS FOR ZERO TO THREE. SO

00:54:36.139 --> 00:54:37.907
THAT WILL- GENERALLY DEPEND ON

00:54:37.974 --> 00:54:40.977
AVAILABLE REVENUE SO WE'LL TAKE

00:54:41.044 --> 00:54:42.646

BE SOME TRACKING IS THAT BEEN

00:54:55.692 --> 00:54:57.494
DECIDED HOW THAT WILL BE DONE

00:54:57.560 --> 00:54:58.662
THAT YOU'RE GOING TO SEE IF

00:54:58.728 --> 00:55:01.698

BEFORE THERE'S ANY ADDITIONAL

00:55:14.511 --> 00:55:15.712
FUNDING THAT FLOWS THAT WAY

00:55:15.779 --> 00:55:17.547
SPECIFICALLY TO THOSE ENTITIES

00:55:17.614 --> 00:55:18.782
WE WANT TO SEE HOW WE'RE

00:55:18.848 --> 00:55:20.417

TERMS OF WHETHER PEOPLE ARE

00:55:27.857 --> 00:55:28.792

OF IMPORTANT METRICS THAT WE

00:55:39.703 --> 00:55:41.371
WOULD BE LOOKING AT. ANOTHER

00:55:41.438 --> 00:55:44.374
ASPECT OF IT AS I UNDERSTAND.

00:55:44.441 --> 00:55:46.476
THAT IF VOCAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD

00:55:46.543 --> 00:55:47.944
DO NOT MEET THE EXPECTATIONS OF

00:55:48.011 --> 00:55:49.079
THE STATE THAT WILL BE SOME

00:55:49.145 --> 00:55:50.814
SANCTIONS IMPOSED OF THOSE BEEN

00:55:50.880 --> 00:55:52.615
DECIDED WHAT SANCTIONS WILL BE

00:55:52.682 --> 00:55:54.150
ON LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. SO I

00:55:54.217 --> 00:55:55.919
THINK YOU MAY BE REFERRING- TO

00:55:55.985 --> 00:55:58.321
A PROPOSAL- FROM- THAT THAT

00:55:58.388 --> 00:55:59.556

00:55:59.622 --> 00:56:01.658
OF THE ADVISORS- TO HIM ON

00:56:01.725 --> 00:56:03.793
HOMELESSNESS REGARDING- PUTTING

IN OBLIGATIONS- FOR. LOCAL AND

00:56:06.663 --> 00:56:08.465
OUR STATE AND TO DECIDE TO.

00:56:08.531 --> 00:56:09.799
HOUSE THE HOMELESSNESS OR AND

00:56:09.866 --> 00:56:11.034
DEAL WITH THIS CRISIS IN A

00:56:11.101 --> 00:56:11.968
SIGNIFICANT WAY- THE GOVERNOR

00:56:12.035 --> 00:56:14.404
HAS- EMBRACE THE GENERAL IDEA

00:56:14.471 --> 00:56:16.439
OF DOING SOMETHING BIG HERE BUT

00:56:16.506 --> 00:56:18.408
HE'S ALSO BAGHDAD THIS IS

00:56:18.475 --> 00:56:19.008
SOMETHING THAT WE WANT TO TAKE

00:56:19.075 --> 00:56:20.910
A LOOK AT WHAT THE LEGISLATURE

00:56:20.977 --> 00:56:21.878
SO I THINK THERE WILL BE MORE

00:56:21.945 --> 00:56:24.214
DETAILS TO COME ON THAT I WOULD

00:56:24.280 --> 00:56:26.850

00:57:48.198 --> 00:57:50.667
MOBILE. FOR COUNTIES- AT SOME

00:57:50.733 --> 00:57:51.701
POINT IN THE FUTURE IT'LL SORT

00:57:51.768 --> 00:57:53.269
OF PLATEAU AND WE'LL GO BACK TO

00:57:53.336 --> 00:57:54.804
A NORMAL HOMEOSTASIS LEVEL.

00:57:54.871 --> 00:57:58.208
OKAY WELL THE JUST BE ADVISED I

00:57:58.274 --> 00:57:59.809
HAVE SOME RESERVATIONS ABOUT

00:57:59.876 --> 00:58:01.511
THIS REDUCING THE PROBATION

00:58:01.578 --> 00:58:04.080
PERIODS AT CETERA- I DON'T BY

00:58:04.147 --> 00:58:05.782
THE LOGIC THAT'S THAT'S GOING

00:58:05.849 --> 00:58:07.550
TO RESULT IN. BETTER

00:58:07.617 --> 00:58:09.819
REHABILITATION OR SUCCESS. ON

00:58:09.886 --> 00:58:11.521
FOR BUT THAT'S UP ON PROBATION

00:58:11.588 --> 00:58:12.922
THAT THAT'S THAT'S A PLACE

00:58:12.989 --> 00:58:14.224
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THREE

00:58:14.290 --> 00:58:16.860
RESPONSE THERE. OF THE IN THIS

00:58:16.926 --> 00:58:19.462
BUDGET THERE'S A BIT LESS MONEY

00:58:19.529 --> 00:58:21.664
FOR WHAT WE CALL DEBT REDUCTION

00:58:21.731 --> 00:58:23.066
IS THAT BECAUSE THE- EXTRA

00:58:23.132 --> 00:58:25.101
MONEY IS BLESSED AND IN THIS

00:58:25.168 --> 00:58:27.170
BUDGET THAN SOME PREVIOUS ONES.

00:58:27.237 --> 00:58:28.838
IT SEEMS LIKE. AND YOU DID

00:58:28.905 --> 00:58:30.573
MENTION FOR EXAMPLE THAT TO

00:58:30.640 --> 00:58:32.208
ACCELERATING THE OF PENSION

00:58:32.275 --> 00:58:34.310
REDUCTIONS THAT WOULD BE. PRIOR

00:58:34.377 --> 00:58:36.846
DONE ALREADY SO NOTHING NEW-

00:58:36.913 --> 00:58:38.448
BUT DESERVED IT IS THAT THE

00:58:38.514 --> 00:58:39.515
REASON THAT WE YOU'RE

00:58:39.582 --> 00:58:41.050
ANTICIPATING LESS SURPLUS

00:58:41.117 --> 00:58:43.019
MONEY. I THINK I NUMBER ONE IT

00:58:43.086 --> 00:58:43.920
IS TRUE THAT WE HAVE A

00:58:43.987 --> 00:58:45.288
SIGNIFICANTLY SMALLER ALTHOUGH

00:58:45.355 --> 00:58:47.490
STILL NOT INSIGNIFICANT-

00:58:47.557 --> 00:58:49.759
SURPLUS OVERALL- BUT NUMBER TWO

00:58:49.826 --> 00:58:51.027
IS THE FACT THAT- YOU TO

00:58:51.094 --> 00:58:52.028
PROPOSITION TWO IS STILL IN

00:58:52.095 --> 00:58:53.830
EFFECT SO WE'VE STILL GOT. BOTH

00:58:53.897 --> 00:58:55.064
OUR DEPOSIT OF TWO BILLION

00:58:55.131 --> 00:58:56.900

PAYMENTS AND WE'RE ACTUALLY

00:58:59.469 --> 00:59:01.070
PROJECTING. OVER THE FORECAST

00:59:01.137 --> 00:59:03.840
PERIOD- IN THE YEAR TWENTY

00:59:03.907 --> 00:59:04.340
THREE TWENTY FOUR UNDER

00:59:04.407 --> 00:59:05.241
PROPOSITION TWO THERE WILL BE

00:59:05.308 --> 00:59:06.943
AN ADDITIONAL ONE POINT ONE.

00:59:07.010 --> 00:59:08.311
BILLION DOLLARS SO IT'S

00:59:08.378 --> 00:59:09.746
CERTAINLY NOT TO THAT WOULD BE

00:59:09.812 --> 00:59:10.580
TO CALPERS A SUPPLEMENTAL

00:59:10.647 --> 00:59:12.649

THAT WE MADE LAST YEAR WILL

00:59:16.452 --> 00:59:18.221

PROFESSIONAL DISTANCE MONEY

00:59:52.455 --> 00:59:53.256

SPECIAL DISTRICTS BEING A PART

00:59:58.194 --> 01:00:00.163
OF THAT. SAW SPEAK GENERALLY

01:00:00.229 --> 01:00:01.564
TERRA HOW THE ADMINISTRATION'S

01:00:01.631 --> 01:00:03.066
THINKING ABOUT THAT MONEY AND

01:00:03.132 --> 01:00:04.000

IT'S AN ADDITIONAL FIFTY

01:00:10.673 --> 01:00:11.641
MILLION DOLLARS FOR WHAT WE'RE

01:00:11.708 --> 01:00:13.376

WHICH IS P. S. P. S. AS YOU

01:00:15.211 --> 01:00:17.313
MENTIONED AND I THINK THE FIRST

01:00:17.380 --> 01:00:18.314
THING I'LL SAY IS THAT

01:00:18.381 --> 01:00:19.415
GOVERNOR'S MADE CLEAR HE

01:00:19.482 --> 01:00:21.451
AGREES. WITH YOUR SENTIMENT

01:00:21.517 --> 01:00:23.086
THAT THIS CANNOT BE A WAY OF

01:00:23.152 --> 01:00:24.921
LIFE AND SO HE'S SPENDING HOURS

01:00:24.988 --> 01:00:26.222
AND HOURS WITH HIS SENIOR

01:00:26.289 --> 01:00:27.991
ADVISERS THINKING ABOUT THE P.

01:00:28.057 --> 01:00:29.258
JEANNIE BANKRUPTCY AND HOW TO

01:00:29.325 --> 01:00:30.693
MAKE SURE THAT THE UTILITIES

AFFORDABLE RELIABLE AND CLEAN

01:00:33.863 --> 01:00:35.832
ENERGY- AND SO WE UNDERSTAND

01:00:35.898 --> 01:00:37.133
THAT IT'S- EVEN IF IT'S GOING

01:00:37.200 --> 01:00:38.134
TO CONTINUE TO BE A CHALLENGE

01:00:38.201 --> 01:00:39.669
FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS.

01:00:39.736 --> 01:00:41.270
CANNOT BE WAY OF LIFE. AND THEN

01:00:41.337 --> 01:00:42.638
THE SECOND THING BECAUSE IT IS

01:00:42.705 --> 01:00:43.773
GOING TO CONTINUE TO BE A

01:00:43.840 --> 01:00:45.108

01:02:01.651 --> 01:02:04.053
IMPORTANT. AS WE MOVE INTO THIS

01:02:04.120 --> 01:02:07.990
PARTICULAR AREA. OF THE I

01:02:08.057 --> 01:02:09.125
MENTIONED IN MY- BRIEF

OF NEW DEPARTMENTS. OF IS IT

01:02:15.631 --> 01:02:17.066
ANTICIPATED THAT THERE WILL BE

01:02:17.133 --> 01:02:19.235
NO NET INCREASE IN P. WHY IS

01:02:19.302 --> 01:02:20.903
WITH THESE REORGANIZATIONS IF

01:02:20.970 --> 01:02:22.772
YOU WILL OR THE CREATION OF NEW

01:02:22.839 --> 01:02:25.208
ENTITIES OR THE RENAMING OF

01:02:25.274 --> 01:02:27.176
ENTITIES. HOW WHAT WHAT SAID IN

01:02:27.243 --> 01:02:29.245
A LOOK LIKE IN TERMS OF. JUST

01:02:29.312 --> 01:02:32.915
THE- NUMBER OF STATE EMPLOYEES.

01:02:32.982 --> 01:02:34.917
YES SO SOME OF THESE ARE

01:02:34.984 --> 01:02:36.819
CONSOLIDATIONS BUT AT THE SAME

01:02:36.886 --> 01:02:39.155
TIME SOME OF THEM ARE NEW LINES

01:02:39.222 --> 01:02:41.023
OF THAT BUSINESS OF LIKE THE

01:02:41.090 --> 01:02:43.059
CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION

01:02:43.126 --> 01:02:44.327
WORK THAT THE GOVERNOR PROPOSES

01:02:44.393 --> 01:02:46.996
TO DO FOR EXAMPLE OR INCREASES

01:02:47.063 --> 01:02:47.663
TO OUR CYBER SECURITY

01:02:47.730 --> 01:02:50.032
CAPABILITIES- OR THE WILD FIRES

01:02:50.099 --> 01:02:50.733
RIGHT INTELLIGENCE IN

01:02:50.800 --> 01:02:52.435
INTEGRATION CENTER. TO SOME OF

01:02:52.502 --> 01:02:53.536
THESE ENTITIES WILL REQUIRE

01:02:53.603 --> 01:02:55.204
ADDITIONAL POSITIONS AND

01:02:55.271 --> 01:02:57.507
SPENDING- AT THE SAME TIME WE

01:02:57.573 --> 01:02:58.708
HOPE THAT SOME OF THESE

01:02:58.774 --> 01:03:00.743
CONSOLIDATIONS- YOU MAY HAVE A

01:03:00.810 --> 01:03:02.111
VERY SIMILAR LEVELS EMPLOYEES

01:03:02.178 --> 01:03:03.246
AND SPENDING TO WHAT YOU HAD

01:03:03.312 --> 01:03:04.780
BEFORE. BUT HOPEFULLY A BETTER

01:03:04.847 --> 01:03:05.982
LEVEL OF SERVICE SO THAT

01:03:06.048 --> 01:03:07.617
CERTAINLY THE IDEA YES IS

01:03:07.683 --> 01:03:09.619
BETTER YEAH I WAS JUST GOING TO

01:03:09.685 --> 01:03:10.920
A SUPPLEMENT THAT CENTER MEALS

01:03:10.987 --> 01:03:12.989
AND WITH- THE FACT THAT WE

01:03:13.055 --> 01:03:14.257
THINK THIS IS ACTUALLY ONE OF

01:03:14.323 --> 01:03:16.025
THE MORE IMPORTANT- BLINDS OF

01:03:16.092 --> 01:03:17.493
DISCUSSION THE YOU MAY HAVE

01:03:17.560 --> 01:03:18.427
THROUGHOUT THE BUDGET PROCESS

01:03:18.494 --> 01:03:20.830
THAT. THE ADDITION OF SOME

01:03:20.897 --> 01:03:24.100
DEPARTMENTS CONSOLIDATIONS. ALL

01:03:24.167 --> 01:03:25.401
OF THE ESTIMATES THAT I TALKED

01:03:25.468 --> 01:03:27.470
ABOUT WITH REGARD TO THE FUTURE

01:03:27.537 --> 01:03:29.472
OF OPERATING POSITION OF THE

01:03:29.539 --> 01:03:31.707
STATE'S BUDGET DO NOT REALLY

01:03:31.774 --> 01:03:33.242
TAKE THOSE INTO ACCOUNT AND TO

01:03:33.309 --> 01:03:34.810
THE EXTENT THAT THEY WOULD ADD

01:03:34.877 --> 01:03:36.412
TO ONGOING COST THEY'RE NOT

01:03:36.479 --> 01:03:38.915
REFLECTED IN THAT. AND SO WHAT

01:03:38.981 --> 01:03:42.251
ELSE MANY OF THEM HAVE GOOD

01:03:42.318 --> 01:03:44.620
IDEAS BEHIND THEM WE THINK THAT

01:03:44.687 --> 01:03:45.521
THAT'S GOING TO BE AN IMPORTANT

01:03:45.588 --> 01:03:46.923
PART OF IT FROM A FISCAL

01:03:46.989 --> 01:03:48.791
STANDPOINT TO TAKE TO TAKE THAT

01:03:48.858 --> 01:03:51.427
INTO ACCOUNT. THE END I WOULD

01:03:51.494 --> 01:03:54.597
VICE AT THE BUDGET COMMITTEE

01:03:54.664 --> 01:03:57.700
SHOULD AS WELL THE- THERE'S NOT.

01:03:57.767 --> 01:03:59.168
IS BEEN DURING IS A NEWLY

01:03:59.235 --> 01:04:01.304
CREATE. STATE AGENCY. END OF

01:04:01.370 --> 01:04:02.038
THE THAT'S JUST SOMETHING WE

01:04:02.104 --> 01:04:03.439
HAVE TO ACCEPT SO WE HAVE TO

01:04:03.506 --> 01:04:06.209
BE. I I'M ARGUING TO BE

01:04:06.275 --> 01:04:08.711
CAUTIOUS ABOUT THAT- DIMENSION

01:04:21.123 --> 01:04:22.992
FOR THIS COMES FROM SPECIAL

01:04:23.059 --> 01:04:23.993

OVERSIGHT THAT'S CURRENTLY IN

01:07:31.414 --> 01:07:33.482
PLACE FOR JAILS AND MODELS THAT

01:07:33.549 --> 01:07:35.918
EXISTS AROUND THE STATE TO HELP

01:07:35.985 --> 01:07:37.119
ADVISE THE LEGISLATURE ON

01:07:37.186 --> 01:07:38.254
WHATEVER PROPOSAL THE

01:07:38.320 --> 01:07:39.955
ADMINISTRATION COMES FORWARD

01:07:40.022 --> 01:07:40.923
THE OTHER THING THAT I'D ADD

01:07:40.990 --> 01:07:42.091
THAT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTICE THE

01:07:42.158 --> 01:07:43.859
STATE HAS PROVIDED HUNDREDS OF

01:07:43.926 --> 01:07:46.128
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. IN FUNDING

01:07:46.195 --> 01:07:48.097
FOR JAIL CONSTRUCTION COM TO

01:07:48.164 --> 01:07:49.932
COUNTIES ALL OVER THE STATE A

01:07:49.999 --> 01:07:50.966
LOT OF THIS FUNDING WAS

01:07:51.033 --> 01:07:53.335
INTENDED TO HELP RETROFIT JAILS

01:07:53.402 --> 01:07:55.604
TO- MAKE THE MORE APPROPRIATE

01:07:55.671 --> 01:07:57.473
FOR LONGER TERM PLACEMENTS THAT

01:07:57.540 --> 01:07:59.475
STARTED OCCURRING AFTER THE

01:07:59.542 --> 01:08:01.343
TWENTY ELEVEN REALIGNMENT. BUT

01:08:01.410 --> 01:08:03.813
I'D ARGUE THAT THE IMPACTS ARE

01:08:03.879 --> 01:08:06.649
ACCELERATING VIA THE LAWSUITS

01:08:06.715 --> 01:08:08.884
AND MY POINT IS WE NEED TO BE

01:08:08.951 --> 01:08:10.719
ATTENDED TO THAT. THE TWO OF

01:08:10.786 --> 01:08:12.721
THE- THANK YOU MANAGER. CENTER

01:08:12.788 --> 01:08:16.459
LIKE ASKING. PICKING UP ON THE

01:08:16.525 --> 01:08:18.894
CONSOLIDATION REORGANIZATION

01:08:18.961 --> 01:08:20.563
SINCE I USED TO DO THAT BEFORE

01:08:20.629 --> 01:08:22.965
I GOT HERE MISTER PECK. CAN YOU

01:08:23.032 --> 01:08:24.934
GIVE US SOME ADVICE HERE

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:25.501
BECAUSE HIS FAVORITE THROUGH

01:08:25.568 --> 01:08:29.505
THE INITIAL DOCUMENT IT SEEMS

01:08:29.572 --> 01:08:32.274
SOME OF THIS IS IN FACT. REALLY

01:08:32.341 --> 01:08:34.343
GOVERNMENT EXPANSION I MEAN THE

01:08:34.410 --> 01:08:36.412
CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION

01:08:36.479 --> 01:08:37.746
WHICH I HAVE A BILL ON

01:08:37.813 --> 01:08:39.348
LICENSING DEBT COLLECTOR SOME

01:08:39.415 --> 01:08:40.850
HAVE SOME INTEREST IN THIS

01:08:40.916 --> 01:08:42.585
SUBJECT MATTER LOOKS LIKE A

01:08:42.651 --> 01:08:44.854
GROWING. STATE GOVERNMENT IN

01:08:44.920 --> 01:08:47.389
ITS FORTY FOUR POSITIONS- THIS

01:08:47.456 --> 01:08:48.858
FIRST YEAR NINETY POSITIONS IN

01:08:48.924 --> 01:08:50.693
NEXT YEAR BUT SOME OF IT REALLY

01:08:50.759 --> 01:08:52.161
LOOKS LIKE CHANGING THE LAWN

01:08:52.228 --> 01:08:53.863
FURNITURE MOVING IT FROM HERE

01:08:53.929 --> 01:08:55.698
TO THERE AND IT'S JUST IT'S AND

01:08:55.764 --> 01:08:57.733
IT HAS A HUGE COST. HAS HUGE

01:08:57.800 --> 01:08:59.235
COST THE GOVERNMENT HOW WOULD

01:08:59.301 --> 01:09:02.104
YOU ADVISE US CANCERS HELIO ON

01:09:02.171 --> 01:09:05.040
TO LOOK AT EACH AND EVERYONE OF

01:09:05.107 --> 01:09:05.908
THESE CONSOLIDATIONS

01:09:05.975 --> 01:09:08.110
REORGANIZATIONS RENAMING SOME

01:09:08.177 --> 01:09:09.478
OF IT JUST LOOKS LIKE. WE'RE

01:09:09.545 --> 01:09:11.247
<u>&lt;c.green&gt;HANGING THE PAINT AND PUTTING&lt;/c&gt;</u>

01:09:11.313 --> 01:09:13.249
IT'S THE SAME FUNCTION. YES

01:09:13.315 --> 01:09:17.119
SENATOR WIECKOWSKI I MEAN WE-

01:09:17.186 --> 01:09:18.053
WITH RESPECT WE ALSO HAD

01:09:18.120 --> 01:09:20.322
QUESTIONS. AND I THINK THAT IS

01:09:20.389 --> 01:09:23.158
SOMETHING THAT. WILL BE AT THE

01:09:23.225 --> 01:09:24.960
VERY IMPORTANT FOR THE

01:09:25.027 --> 01:09:26.862
LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER BECAUSE-

01:09:26.929 --> 01:09:28.631
YOU KNOW AS I MENTIONED IN THE

01:09:28.697 --> 01:09:30.366
MULTI YEAR OUTLET- THE

01:09:30.432 --> 01:09:32.034
ESTIMATES REALLY DON'T ACCOUNT

01:09:32.101 --> 01:09:33.435
FOR THAT SO THERE COULD BE

01:09:33.502 --> 01:09:35.204
HIGHER COST AND WHAT WERE SEEN

01:09:35.271 --> 01:09:36.505
SO WE THINK THERE. I KNOW YOU

01:09:36.572 --> 01:09:38.173
MAY HAVE SPECIFIC QUESTIONS BUT

01:09:38.240 --> 01:09:39.608
I THINK THERE'S SOME KIND OF

01:09:39.675 --> 01:09:41.243
GLOBAL FIGHTS THE YOU MAY WANT

01:09:41.310 --> 01:09:42.278
TO KEEP IN MIND AS YOU THINK

01:09:42.344 --> 01:09:44.446
THROUGH THIS ONE IS YOU KNOW

01:09:44.513 --> 01:09:46.415
WITH THE REORGANIZATION LEAD TO

01:09:46.482 --> 01:09:48.083
MORE EFFECTIVENESS OR BETTER

01:09:48.150 --> 01:09:50.319
SERVICES. WOULD IT- INCREASE

01:09:50.386 --> 01:09:52.555
EFFICIENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY

01:09:52.621 --> 01:09:53.923
TO MAKE THE CHANGES IN WHATEVER

01:09:53.989 --> 01:09:56.192
PARTICULAR- DEPARTMENT THE

01:09:56.258 --> 01:09:58.794
THIRD DISCUSSING- YOU KNOW.

01:09:58.861 --> 01:10:00.262
WITH THAT AND THERE'S ALSO A

01:10:00.329 --> 01:10:02.264
PUBLIC RELATIONS ELEMENT TO IT

01:10:02.331 --> 01:10:03.299
HOW WITH THE PUBLIC RELATE TO

01:10:03.365 --> 01:10:04.800
THEIR STATE GOVERNMENT WOULD IT

01:10:04.867 --> 01:10:06.969
WOULDN'T ALTER THAT- CONNECTION

01:10:07.036 --> 01:10:08.971
THAT THEY HAVE IN A WAY THAT

01:10:09.038 --> 01:10:09.672
THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND AND SO

01:10:09.738 --> 01:10:11.607
THEY'RE SORT OF A- A PUBLIC

01:10:11.674 --> 01:10:13.475
FACING ELEMENT TO THIS. AND

01:10:13.542 --> 01:10:18.180
THEN- THE- WE ALSO THINK THAT

01:10:18.247 --> 01:10:19.848
THERE'S A CO ABOUT HOW DOES THE

01:10:19.915 --> 01:10:21.350
ADMINISTRATION PLAN TO

01:10:21.417 --> 01:10:23.118
EFFECTUATE THESE CHANGES WOULD

01:10:23.185 --> 01:10:29.391
BE THROUGH TRAILER BILL-LANGUAGE OR WOULD IT BE THROUGH.

01:10:29.458 --> 01:10:32.027
FROM FROM THE- THE INTENT OF

01:10:32.094 --> 01:10:34.463
THE REORGANIZATION OR THE NEW

01:10:34.530 --> 01:10:35.664
DEPARTMENTS THE- OBJECTIVES

01:10:35.731 --> 01:10:37.633
THAT ARE- HOPE TO BE ACHIEVED

01:10:37.700 --> 01:10:39.868
WITH IT. AND THEN ALSO HOW IT

01:10:39.935 --> 01:10:41.537
WOULD BE PUT INTO A FACT THESE

01:10:41.604 --> 01:10:42.905
ARE ALL IMPORTANT QUESTIONS

01:10:42.972 --> 01:10:45.608
THAT I THINK SHOULD PROBABLY-

01:10:45.674 --> 01:10:47.343
SERVICE THE BACKDROP TO ANY OF

01:10:47.409 --> 01:10:50.879
THESE CONVERSATIONS. ANYTHING

01:10:50.946 --> 01:10:54.350
THAT MR THIS MORNING OFTEN. IS

01:10:54.416 --> 01:10:55.384
THE MAIN THING IS WE LOOK

01:10:55.451 --> 01:10:56.218
FORWARD TO ENGAGING THE

01:10:56.285 --> 01:10:57.720
DISCUSSION ON THIS ISSUE I WILL

01:10:57.786 --> 01:10:59.788
SAY THAT- FOR SOME THE ENTITIES

01:10:59.855 --> 01:11:01.023
LIKE THAT PROPOSED CONSUMER

01:11:01.090 --> 01:11:02.191
FINANCIAL PROTECTION THAT YOU

01:11:02.257 --> 01:11:03.826
MENTIONED- THOSE WOULD BE

01:11:03.892 --> 01:11:05.761
FUNDED OUT OF PECIAL FUNDS- SO

01:11:05.828 --> 01:11:06.328
WOULDN'T IT WOULDN'T

01:11:06.395 --> 01:11:08.097
NECESSARILY BE COMPETING. WITH

01:11:08.163 --> 01:11:10.132
OTHER GENERAL FUND RESOURCES-

01:11:10.199 --> 01:11:12.034
AND THEN I THINK THAT TWO OTHER

01:11:12.101 --> 01:11:13.402
POINTS ALL MAKE MORE BROADLY

01:11:13.469 --> 01:11:15.337
ARE NUMBER ONE YEAH I CERTAINLY

01:11:15.404 --> 01:11:16.839
I THINK EVERY PROPOSAL OF OURS

01:11:16.905 --> 01:11:18.707
AND SPECIFICALLY WITH REGARD TO

01:11:18.774 --> 01:11:20.943
THE ORGANIZATION- DESERVE

01:11:21.010 --> 01:11:22.745
SCRUTINY. I DO THINK THAT FOR

01:11:22.811 --> 01:11:24.380
SOME OF THE KEY PRIORITY AREAS

01:11:24.446 --> 01:11:25.514
FOR EXAMPLE WORKFORCE

01:11:25.581 --> 01:11:27.282
DEVELOPMENT OR CANNABIS WERE

01:11:27.349 --> 01:11:28.183
RIGHT OR SETTING UP A NEW

01:11:28.250 --> 01:11:30.519
REGIME- OR SOMETHING THAT'S

01:11:30.586 --> 01:11:32.221
VERY RECENT OR SOMETHING WHERE

01:11:32.287 --> 01:11:33.589
THE ECONOMY IN THE WORLD IS

01:11:33.656 --> 01:11:34.323
CHANGING AND WE WANT TO ADOPT

01:11:34.390 --> 01:11:36.525
WITH THAT- WE DO THINK THAT IT

01:11:36.592 --> 01:11:37.860
MAKES SENSE. EVEN IF IT DOES

01:11:37.926 --> 01:11:39.628
INVOLVE MOVING DEPARTMENTS-

01:11:39.695 --> 01:11:41.130
FROM OR DIVISIONS FROM ONE

01:11:41.196 --> 01:11:43.098
PLACE TO ANOTHER AND I GUESS

01:11:43.165 --> 01:11:44.767
THAT'S WHERE THE BROADER POINT-

01:11:44.833 --> 01:11:45.768
WHICH CENTER NIELSEN AND ALSO

01:11:45.834 --> 01:11:47.069
MENTIONED IN ITS OWN WAY IT

01:11:47.136 --> 01:11:48.137
OFTEN AND GOVERNMENTS WHEN YOU

01:11:48.203 --> 01:11:49.838
CREATE SOMETHING. IT STAYS

01:11:49.905 --> 01:11:50.806
THERE AND WE CERTAINLY DON'T

01:11:50.873 --> 01:11:53.008
WANNA SHUFFLED DEPARTMENTS ARE

01:11:53.075 --> 01:11:53.909
A AT AROUND FOR DIVISIONS FOR

01:11:53.976 --> 01:11:55.511
THE SECOND SHUFFLING BUT IF IT

01:11:55.577 --> 01:11:56.679
DOES MAKE SENSE TO OBJECT

01:11:56.745 --> 01:11:57.946
GOVERNMENT FOR THE NEEDS OF THE

01:11:58.013 --> 01:12:01.950
TWENTY FIRST CENTURY AD. THAT

01:12:02.017 --> 01:12:02.584
IS SOMETHING THAT WE WOULD WANT

01:12:02.651 --> 01:12:04.520
TO PROPOSE. CAN THE CONCERN

01:12:04.586 --> 01:12:08.590
FIND. OUR PROTECTION BUREAU

01:12:08.657 --> 01:12:09.858
USED REGULATION HE WON'T HAVE

01:12:09.925 --> 01:12:12.061
MORE REGULATION THIS OBVIOUSLY

01:12:12.127 --> 01:12:13.796
I HAVE AN INTEREST IN LICENSING

01:12:13.862 --> 01:12:15.564
DIED AND TO INTRODUCE BILL THE

01:12:15.631 --> 01:12:17.099
THAT BUT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT

01:12:17.166 --> 01:12:18.634
ENFORCEMENT ARE YOU TALKING

01:12:18.701 --> 01:12:20.836
ABOUT REGISTRATION WHAT DO YOU

01:12:20.903 --> 01:12:23.372
GUYS AND THE THIS IS THE EARLY

01:12:23.439 --> 01:12:26.442
STAGES ON WHAT. DEREGULATION

01:12:26.508 --> 01:12:29.078
SCARE SOME PEOPLE OF HER ENOUGH.

01:12:29.144 --> 01:12:30.112
MORE REGULATION I DON'T KNOW IF

01:12:30.179 --> 01:12:31.914
THAT'S ACTUALLY GOOD OR WHAT'S

01:12:31.980 --> 01:12:34.016
THE GOAL. I SEE MORE LOOKING AT

01:12:34.083 --> 01:12:35.751
THE CONSUMER RIGHT YES AND SO

01:12:35.818 --> 01:12:36.985
THE FIRST BROADER POINT I'LL

01:12:37.052 --> 01:12:38.921
MAKE FOR THIS SPECIFIC ENTITIES

01:12:38.987 --> 01:12:40.723
THAT ACTION THIS CASE ALTHOUGH

01:12:40.789 --> 01:12:41.990
IT ISN'T THAT I MENTIONED IT

01:12:42.057 --> 01:12:43.859
MYSELF ANALOGOUS TO THE CFPB IN

01:12:43.926 --> 01:12:46.028
MANY AYS. THE CFPB IS AN

01:12:46.095 --> 01:12:47.796
INDEPENDENT FEDERAL BUREAU IN

01:12:47.863 --> 01:12:48.764
THIS CASE WE'RE NOT PROPOSING

01:12:48.831 --> 01:12:51.533
CREATING A BRAND NEW- AGENCY OR

01:12:51.600 --> 01:12:52.534
DEPARTMENT THIS WOULD BE WITHIN

01:12:52.601 --> 01:12:53.902
THE DEPARTMENT OF BUSINESS

01:12:53.969 --> 01:12:55.437
OVERSIGHT RATHER IT'S GIVING

01:12:55.504 --> 01:12:57.172
THAT NEW POSITIONS FORTY FOUR

01:12:57.239 --> 01:12:57.806
AS YOU MENTIONED. AND NEW

01:12:57.873 --> 01:12:59.742
POWERS WHEN IT COMES TO

01:12:59.808 --> 01:13:01.276
SPECIFICALLY WHAT THOSE POWERS

01:13:01.343 --> 01:13:03.378
ARE AT I THINK I WOULD SUB

01:13:03.445 --> 01:13:04.646
SEPARATE THEM INTO FOUR GENERAL

01:13:04.713 --> 01:13:07.082
AREAS IN ONE CERTAINLY IS THIS-

01:13:07.149 --> 01:13:08.317
ENFORCEMENT THAT YOU'RE

01:13:08.383 --> 01:13:09.885
DISCUSSING AND REGULATION AND

01:13:09.952 --> 01:13:10.753
THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE OFTEN THINK

01:13:10.819 --> 01:13:11.653
ABOUT TO THINK ABOUT WHAT

01:13:11.720 --> 01:13:13.355
OCCASION AND- HOLDING PEOPLE TO

01:13:13.422 --> 01:13:14.523
ACCOUNT. AND THAT IS VERY

01:13:14.590 --> 01:13:15.824
IMPORTANT BUT THAT CERTAINLY

01:13:15.891 --> 01:13:17.493
NOT THE WHOLE EXTENT OF WHAT

01:13:17.559 --> 01:13:18.293
THE GOVERNOR IS TRYING TO

01:13:18.360 --> 01:13:20.429
ACCOMPLISH HERE IN ADDITION-

01:13:20.496 --> 01:13:21.230
THERE IS THE AREA OF

01:13:21.296 --> 01:13:22.531
SUPERVISION WHICH I THINK IS

01:13:22.598 --> 01:13:24.099
REALLY IMPORTANT AND LICENSING.

01:13:24.166 --> 01:13:25.400
AND MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE

01:13:25.467 --> 01:13:26.735
WORKING WITH THAT CITY SO THAT

01:13:26.802 --> 01:13:27.569
THEY ARE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE

01:13:27.636 --> 01:13:29.004
LAW THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO GO

01:13:29.071 --> 01:13:30.072
AFTER THEM WHEN THEY'RE OUT OF

01:13:30.139 --> 01:13:31.540
COMPLIANCE WITH THE LAW- THE

01:13:31.607 --> 01:13:33.909
THIRD AREA IS ANALYSIS BECAUSE

01:13:33.976 --> 01:13:35.177
THEY'RE A LOT OF PLACES YOU

01:13:35.244 --> 01:13:35.878
KNOW. THERE'S FINANCIAL

01:13:35.944 --> 01:13:37.246
INNOVATION BUT THERE'S ALSO

01:13:37.312 --> 01:13:38.847
FINANCIAL FRAUD INNOVATION AND

01:13:38.914 --> 01:13:40.082
PARTICULARLY IN AN ERA THAT WE

01:13:40.149 --> 01:13:41.316
LIVE IN WHICH YOU KNOW BLOCK

01:13:41.383 --> 01:13:41.884
CHAIN AND FINANCIAL

01:13:41.950 --> 01:13:43.585
TECHNOLOGIES WE NEED A

01:13:43.652 --> 01:13:45.154
GOVERNMENT- FUNCTION THAT IS

01:13:45.220 --> 01:13:46.555
LOOKING AT WE ARE ALL THIS IS

01:13:46.622 --> 01:13:48.423
GOING IN ANALYZING WHERE WE

01:13:48.490 --> 01:13:50.025
NEED TO PUT MORE RESOURCES AND

01:13:50.092 --> 01:13:51.693
NEW TYPES OF PROBLEMS THAT WE

01:13:51.760 --> 01:13:52.594
HAVE TO ATTACK. AND THEN

01:13:52.661 --> 01:13:54.062
FINALLY THE LAST AREA BUT

01:13:54.129 --> 01:13:55.230
CERTAINLY WE SEE PUBLIC

01:13:55.297 --> 01:13:56.565
AWARENESS WHICH IS EASY TO.

01:13:56.632 --> 01:13:58.967
DOWN BUT CERTAINLY PEOPLE ARE

01:13:59.034 --> 01:14:00.202
APPLYING FOR LOANS ARE APPLYING

01:14:00.269 --> 01:14:02.037
FOR FINANCIAL PRODUCTS YOU WANT

01:14:02.104 --> 01:14:04.039
TO REGULATE AND SUPERVISE- THE

01:14:04.106 --> 01:14:04.940
ENTITY THAT IS PROVIDING THOSE

01:14:05.007 --> 01:14:06.608
PRODUCTS BUT IT ALSO HELPS IF

01:14:06.675 --> 01:14:08.443
THE CONSUMER THEMSELVES AS AS

01:14:08.510 --> 01:14:10.279
EDUCATED AS POSSIBLE AND AS

01:14:10.345 --> 01:14:13.015
WARY- AS TO WHAT NOT TOUCH THE

01:14:13.081 --> 01:14:14.416
PRICE MIGHT BE VULNERABLE. SO

01:14:14.483 --> 01:14:16.151
WE SEE ALL THOSE FUNCTIONS

01:14:16.218 --> 01:14:17.686
RELEVANT THIS NEW THE WITHIN TO

01:14:17.753 --> 01:14:23.959
BE. OUT SO WHAT'S- THE-

01:14:24.026 --> 01:14:25.727
GOVERNOR'S ROCK CLIMB BUDGET SO

01:14:25.794 --> 01:14:26.361
WE'RE AT TWELVE BILLION DOLLARS

01:14:26.428 --> 01:14:28.430
FOR YOUR- FUNNY THING. IS MY-

01:14:28.497 --> 01:14:30.065
YEAR. IN THE ON THE BUDGET. AND

01:14:30.132 --> 01:14:31.200
EACH YEAR WHETHER WAS BROWN TO

01:14:31.266 --> 01:14:33.068
MINUTES. THE NEW SEMESTER. THEY

01:14:33.135 --> 01:14:36.305
PROPOSE. REVENUES FROM CAPTAIN

01:14:36.371 --> 01:14:37.773
TREAT BEING ABOUT TWO POINT

01:14:37.840 --> 01:14:38.874
THREE TWO POINT FOUR BILLION

01:14:38.941 --> 01:14:40.742
DOLLARS AND EVERY YEAR SINCE

01:14:40.809 --> 01:14:41.510
I'VE BEEN ON THIS BUDGET

01:14:41.577 --> 01:14:43.178
COMMITTEE IT COMES IN BETWEEN

01:14:43.245 --> 01:14:44.179
THREE POINT FOUR AND THREE

01:14:44.246 --> 01:14:46.315
POINT SIX. SO FOR THE MISTER

01:14:46.381 --> 01:14:48.350
PATRICK- WHAT ARE YOUR

01:14:48.417 --> 01:14:49.685
EXPECTATIONS ON REVENUES

01:14:49.751 --> 01:14:51.453
BECAUSE I DIDN'T HEAR ANYTHING

01:14:51.520 --> 01:14:53.121
OR READ ANYTHING THAT SOMETHING

01:14:53.188 --> 01:14:55.023
IN THE MARKETS CHANGING THAT

01:14:55.090 --> 01:14:57.125
WOULD GIVEN THE SIXTEEN DOLLARS

01:14:57.192 --> 01:14:58.594
AND SEVENTY THREE CENTS

01:14:58.660 --> 01:15:00.028
WHATEVER THE- WHATEVER THE FLOW

01:15:00.095 --> 01:15:03.232
OF THE- ALLOWANCES FOR THE COST

01:15:03.298 --> 01:15:05.033
IS ON THE BUDGET ONE. IS TO THE

01:15:05.100 --> 01:15:06.802
CHANGE THAT WOULD MAKE THE

01:15:06.869 --> 01:15:09.705
REVENUES GO DOWN WELL I MEAN I

01:15:09.771 --> 01:15:11.006
THINK OUR NUMBERS ARE FAIRLY

01:15:11.073 --> 01:15:12.708
SIMILAR TO THE ADMINISTRATION

01:15:12.774 --> 01:15:15.210
BRIAN- BRIAN BROWN MY PEOPLE TO

01:15:15.277 --> 01:15:19.147
HELP. GOOD MORNING BRIAN. GOOD

01:15:19.214 --> 01:15:20.382
MORNING BRIAN BROWN WITH THE LA

01:15:20.449 --> 01:15:23.852
L. I OUR- REVENUE ESTIMATES FOR

01:15:23.919 --> 01:15:25.354
CAP AND TRADE. ARE PRETTY

01:15:25.420 --> 01:15:26.755
SIMILAR TO THE ADMINISTRATION I

01:15:26.822 --> 01:15:27.756
THINK WE MIGHT HAVE SOME SLIGHT

01:15:27.823 --> 01:15:29.324
DIFFERENCES IN OUR ASSUMPTIONS

01:15:29.391 --> 01:15:32.561
ABOUT THE- ALLOWANCE PRICES-

01:15:32.628 --> 01:15:33.829
BUT BOTH OF OUR MODELS ASSUME

01:15:33.896 --> 01:15:36.331
THAT ALL OUR TO SELL- AND THE

01:15:36.398 --> 01:15:37.966
CURRENT PRICE IS PRETTY CLOSE

01:15:38.033 --> 01:15:39.501
TO THE FLOOR. THERE WERE SOME

01:15:39.568 --> 01:15:41.103
HANDS AT LEAST FOR THE CURRENT

01:15:41.169 --> 01:15:42.070
YEAR IN THE BUDGET YOU WERE

01:15:42.137 --> 01:15:43.906
PRETTY CLOSE. WHAT COULD CHANGE

01:15:43.972 --> 01:15:46.408
GOING FORWARD IS REALLY- THE

01:15:46.475 --> 01:15:48.677
THAT THAT PRICE SO IF ALLOWING

01:15:48.744 --> 01:15:50.545
PRICES GO UP SIGNIFICANTLY THAT

01:15:50.612 --> 01:15:52.080
WILL GENERATE MORE REVENUE. OF

01:15:52.147 --> 01:15:54.483
COURSE REMIND MEMBERS SAY 60%

01:15:54.549 --> 01:15:56.451
OF. CAP AND TRADE REVENUES ARE

01:15:56.518 --> 01:15:58.353
CONTINUOUSLY APPROPRIATED SO

01:15:58.420 --> 01:15:59.554
WHATEVER ADDITIONAL REVENUES

01:15:59.621 --> 01:16:01.723
COME IN IT LESS THAN HALF THAT

01:16:01.790 --> 01:16:03.425
WOULD BE AVAILABLE FOR. THOSE

01:16:03.492 --> 01:16:05.227
THE DISCRETIONARY-

01:16:05.294 --> 01:16:08.997
EXPENDITURES- WE WILL HAVE TO

01:16:09.064 --> 01:16:10.499
MORE OPTIONS IN THE CURRENT

01:16:10.565 --> 01:16:11.700
YEAR SO WE WILL KNOW BEFORE THE

01:16:11.767 --> 01:16:13.235
END OF THE FISCAL YEAR WHAT THE

01:16:13.302 --> 01:16:15.971
EXACT. LEVEL REVENUE IS- THAT'S

01:16:16.038 --> 01:16:17.906
AVAILABLE- GOING INTO THE NEW

01:16:17.973 --> 01:16:19.374
FISCAL YEAR BUT OF COURSE IT IS

01:16:19.441 --> 01:16:20.008
A PROJECTION GOING FORWARD

01:16:20.075 --> 01:16:21.310
AFTER THAT. YOU KNOW THE

01:16:21.376 --> 01:16:22.577
LEGISLATURE IN THEIR WISDOM

01:16:22.644 --> 01:16:23.779
WHEN THEY SET UP THE CAPTAIN

01:16:23.845 --> 01:16:25.347
TREAT THEY GAVE THE AUTHORITY

01:16:25.414 --> 01:16:27.049
TO THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH. DEAR

01:16:27.115 --> 01:16:28.583
RESOURCE BOARD RIGHT NOW HAS

01:16:28.650 --> 01:16:31.386
THE AUTHORITY TODAY TO SET THE

01:16:31.453 --> 01:16:33.355
PRICE OF THE ALLOWANCES BUT

01:16:33.422 --> 01:16:35.223
THERE'S NOTHING IN THIS BUDGET

01:16:35.290 --> 01:16:37.492
THAT WOULD SUGGEST. A SIGNAL TO

01:16:37.559 --> 01:16:39.127
THE MARKET THAT WE MAY BE

01:16:39.194 --> 01:16:41.296
CHANGED RAISING THE PRICE OF

01:16:41.363 --> 01:16:42.798
THE ALL OF THE OPTIONS. YOU

01:16:42.864 --> 01:16:44.066
KNOW THERE'S A BIG DISCUSSION

01:16:44.132 --> 01:16:44.967
OUT THERE ON THE PRICE OF

01:16:45.033 --> 01:16:47.469
CARBON SOME WOULD ARGUE THAT

01:16:47.536 --> 01:16:49.705
16% ISN'T BEERS AT SIXTEEN

01:16:49.771 --> 01:16:51.606
DOLLARS IS EMBARRASSINGLY LOW.

01:16:51.673 --> 01:16:52.808
YOU'VE HEARD REPORTS WITH THE

01:16:52.874 --> 01:16:54.543
LA- THAT HAVE SUGGEST THAT WE

01:16:54.609 --> 01:16:55.544
SHOULD BE IN THE FIFTY TO

01:16:55.610 --> 01:16:58.246
SIXTY. DOLLARS HOW DO YOU HAVE

01:16:58.313 --> 01:17:00.482
A CLIMATE POLICY OVER FIVE

01:17:00.549 --> 01:17:02.684
YEARS FOR TWELVE. MILLION THE

01:17:02.751 --> 01:17:04.286
TO GIVE US A HAND. OF WHAT

01:17:04.353 --> 01:17:05.287
YOU'RE GOING TO DO WITH SETTING

01:17:05.354 --> 01:17:08.023
THE PRICE. SO THAT'S JUST A

01:17:08.090 --> 01:17:08.824
QUESTION BECAUSE YOU COULD COME

01:17:08.890 --> 01:17:10.959
BACK FOR ON THIS CLIMATE AND

01:17:11.026 --> 01:17:12.260
YOU COULD COME BACK TO SEPT TWO

01:17:12.327 --> 01:17:14.062
BUT THERE'S IT IT SEEMS LIKE

01:17:14.129 --> 01:17:15.630
THERE'S A MEAGER AMOUNT OF

01:17:15.697 --> 01:17:17.766
REVENUE WHICH YOU CONTROL.

01:17:17.833 --> 01:17:20.035
RIGHT NOW YOU COULD SAY TWENTY

01:17:20.102 --> 01:17:20.702
ONE DOLLARS AND THE NEXT

01:17:20.769 --> 01:17:22.838
OPTION. WOULD NOT ACCEPTING ANY

01:17:22.904 --> 01:17:24.006
BITS AND THAT WOULD SEND THE

01:17:24.072 --> 01:17:25.674
PRICE THE MARKET WOULD ALSO

01:17:25.741 --> 01:17:27.609
SEND THE PRICE FOR WHAT THE

THAT ALL THE DOLLARS SOB BUT

01:17:49.364 --> 01:17:50.732
IT'S LIKE. THE AMOUNT OF

01:17:50.799 --> 01:17:52.434
REVENUE THAT THE COURTS.

01:17:52.501 --> 01:17:55.804
COLLECT IS GIGANTIC I MEAN IT'S-

01:17:55.871 --> 01:17:58.140
I DIDN'T SEE THAT THE OFFSET

01:17:58.206 --> 01:18:00.509
THE LOSS THAT THE IF THE- ALLOW

01:18:00.575 --> 01:18:01.777
INDIGENT PEOPLE NOT TO PAY

PUBLIC POLICY. IT'S MUCH MORE

01:18:04.880 --> 01:18:07.582

IS THE COURTS TO WHAT THE.

01:18:10.819 --> 01:18:12.487
MISSING GAP OF WHAT THEY'RE

01:18:12.554 --> 01:18:14.556
WHAT THEY'RE NOT COLLECTING IN

01:18:14.623 --> 01:18:16.124
THE ELEVEN MILLION THIS PEN

01:18:16.191 --> 01:18:18.026
IDENTIFIED YES SO I WANT TO

01:18:18.093 --> 01:18:19.694
CLARIFY THAT PROGRAM WE'RE

01:18:19.761 --> 01:18:20.695
PROPOSING AND THEN MY COLLEAGUE

01:18:20.762 --> 01:18:22.164

FINES AND FEES FOR YOU KNOW

01:18:26.401 --> 01:18:27.702
WE'RE TALKING IN EXCESS OF A

01:18:27.769 --> 01:18:29.404
BILLION DOLLARS RIGHT IN SO

01:18:29.471 --> 01:18:30.906
THIS IS YOU KNOW A SMALL PART

01:18:30.972 --> 01:18:32.741
OF THAT I THINK OF WHAT WE

01:18:32.808 --> 01:18:34.543
GOVERNOR'S POPOSING IS NUMBER

01:18:34.609 --> 01:18:35.811
ONE EXPANDING A PILOT WHICH WAS

01:18:35.877 --> 01:18:37.145
A PILOT PROGRAMS. THAT STARTED

01:18:37.212 --> 01:18:38.780
LAST YEAR IT WAS FOCUS

01:18:38.847 --> 01:18:40.415
SPECIFICALLY ON TRAFFIC

01:18:40.482 --> 01:18:41.950
INFRACTIONS AND THE FINES AND

01:18:42.017 --> 01:18:43.618
FEES ASSOCIATED WITH THAT FOR

01:18:43.685 --> 01:18:45.520
LOW INCOME AN INDIVIDUAL

01:18:45.587 --> 01:18:46.021
INDIGENT INDIVIDUALS OR

INTERACTING WITH THE COURT

01:18:46.655 --> 01:18:48.824
SYSTEM- SO THIS WOULD EXPAND

01:18:48.890 --> 01:18:50.625
THAT PILOTS STATEWIDE- EXPANDED

01:18:50.692 --> 01:18:51.893
TO INCLUDE SOME NON TRAFFIC

01:18:51.960 --> 01:18:53.829
INFRACTIONS CONTINUE TO FOCUS

01:18:53.895 --> 01:18:55.897
ON. LOW INCOME INDIVIDUALS- BUT

01:18:55.964 --> 01:18:57.399
THIS IS CERTAINLY NOT A

01:18:57.466 --> 01:18:59.501
PROPOSAL- TO WHITE SUEDE

01:18:59.568 --> 01:19:00.769

TO THOSE FINES AND FEES-

01:19:02.304 --> 01:19:02.838
BECAUSE THAT WOULD TAKE THE

01:19:02.904 --> 01:19:04.005
LEVEL FUNDING THAT YOU WERE

01:19:04.072 --> 01:19:05.474
DESCRIBING IT'S RATHER TO EASE

01:19:05.540 --> 01:19:07.008
THE BURDEN AND INCREASE THE

01:19:07.075 --> 01:19:09.845
RELIEF THAT WE'RE PROVIDING TO

01:19:09.911 --> 01:19:11.313
THOSE INDIVIDUALS OVER TIME.

01:19:11.379 --> 01:19:13.949
SIR SERVICE TO. FINANCE AND-

01:19:14.015 --> 01:19:14.816
THE ONLY OTHER THING I WANTED

01:19:14.883 --> 01:19:16.184
TO ADD WAS THAT THAT ELEVEN

01:19:16.251 --> 01:19:17.552
MILLION DOLLARS IS THE PORTION

01:19:17.619 --> 01:19:20.055
RELATIVE TO TWENTY TWENTY ONE.

01:19:20.122 --> 01:19:21.256

MILLION DOLLARS. AND OVER AT

01:19:24.092 --> 01:19:26.761

DO THINK THAT THIS IS- OR THE

01:19:29.397 --> 01:19:29.998
NUMBER I'M SORRY THE REVENUE

01:19:30.065 --> 01:19:31.766
BACK FILL IS BASED ON THE PILOT

01:19:31.833 --> 01:19:33.301
TODAY AND ITS OPERATING ONLY IN

01:19:33.368 --> 01:19:35.604
FOR COURT SO- HARD TO. JUDGE

01:19:35.670 --> 01:19:37.939
WHETHER OR NOT AND- THIS IS THE

01:19:38.006 --> 01:19:39.608
RIGHT AMOUNT BUT WILL ADJUST AS

01:19:39.674 --> 01:19:40.442
WE GO FORWARD BUT SINCE FOR

01:19:40.509 --> 01:19:41.843
EXPANDING TO ALL COURTS AND WE-

THE- IT. PHASES ANIMALS OUT

01:19:44.679 --> 01:19:47.215
OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS.

01:19:47.282 --> 01:19:47.716
THAT'S THE BACK FILL OR

01:19:47.782 --> 01:19:51.419
EXPECTING. THANK YOU SIR

THANK YOU FOR THE FEEDBACK. TWO

01:20:04.566 --> 01:20:07.936
ISSUES I WANT TO FOCUS ON FIRST.

01:20:08.003 --> 01:20:09.471
ONE IS FOR THE CONTINUE TO

01:20:09.538 --> 01:20:10.939
CLIMB A CONVERSATION THAT

01:20:11.006 --> 01:20:13.074
CENTER Y. CASKEY STARTED- WITH

01:20:13.141 --> 01:20:14.543
A LITTLE DIFFERENT LANES I KNOW

01:20:14.609 --> 01:20:19.748
LAST. LAST YEAR WE HAD IT IS

01:20:19.814 --> 01:20:22.684
THE SAME OVERVIEW HEARING IN.

01:20:22.751 --> 01:20:24.619
MY QUESTION IS STILL THE SAME.

01:20:24.686 --> 01:20:28.256
WHICH IS VIEWING CLIMATE IN A

01:20:28.323 --> 01:20:30.859
FISCAL LENDS NOT JUST AS A

01:20:30.926 --> 01:20:32.827
CATEGORY FOR EXPENDITURES HER

01:20:32.894 --> 01:20:34.763
FOR MITIGATION BUT LOOKING AT

01:20:34.829 --> 01:20:38.066
IT AS A LIABILITY I CAN TO

01:20:38.133 --> 01:20:40.735
OTHER LIABILITIES AND DEBTS WE

01:20:40.802 --> 01:20:42.237
HAVE IS A STATE THAT. WILL IN

01:20:42.304 --> 01:20:43.805
THEORY GROW SUBSTANTIALLY OVER

01:20:43.872 --> 01:20:45.440
TIME I KNOW WE DO A PRETTY

01:20:45.507 --> 01:20:46.975
THOROUGH ANALYSIS ON OUR

01:20:47.042 --> 01:20:50.111
PENSIONS AND RETIREMENT- OTHER

01:20:50.178 --> 01:20:52.280
DEBTS THAT- ME A CREW OVER

01:20:52.347 --> 01:20:57.319
OVER- COURSE OF DECADES. BUT MY

01:20:57.385 --> 01:21:00.922
BIG CONCERN IS THAT. WE'VE NOT

01:21:00.989 --> 01:21:02.724
YET TO MY KNOWLEDGE ANALYZED

01:21:02.791 --> 01:21:05.760
WHAT CLIMATE WRIT LARGE COULD

01:21:05.827 --> 01:21:07.996
POSE TO THE STATE BUDGET- I

01:21:08.063 --> 01:21:09.364
KNOW THAT THE FOURTH CLIMATE

01:21:09.431 --> 01:21:10.832
ASSESSMENT DID SORT OF LOOK AT

01:21:10.899 --> 01:21:12.567
SOME VERY HIGH LEVEL NUMBERS IS

01:21:12.634 --> 01:21:14.069
A STATE FOR WHAT WE COULD BE

01:21:14.135 --> 01:21:16.438
SEEING SAY OUT TO TWENTY FIFTY

01:21:16.504 --> 01:21:18.673
OR EVEN THE TWENTY ONE HUNDRED-

01:21:18.740 --> 01:21:20.442
BUT I'M WONDERING IF ANY

01:21:20.508 --> 01:21:23.111
FURTHER ANALYSIS HAS BEEN DONE-

01:21:23.178 --> 01:21:26.114
SAY ON THE- THIS YEAR BASIS BUT

01:21:26.181 --> 01:21:28.116
MAYBE ON A FIVE OR TEN YEAR

01:21:28.183 --> 01:21:30.418
PROJECTION OF. WHAT KIND OF

01:21:30.485 --> 01:21:32.420
UNFORESEEN EXPENDITURES WE

01:21:32.487 --> 01:21:35.123
MIGHT BE FACING IF WE DON'T

01:21:35.190 --> 01:21:37.959
JUST GET YOUR FIRES BUT WE ALSO

01:21:38.026 --> 01:21:40.595
GET A YEAR OF FIRES AND A YEAR

01:21:40.662 --> 01:21:43.565
WITH A SUPER FLOOD- ON TOP OF

01:21:43.632 --> 01:21:46.568
THAT DROUGHT. USGS I DON'T KNOW

01:21:46.635 --> 01:21:47.669
IF YOU'VE SEEN SOME OF THEIR

01:21:47.736 --> 01:21:49.804
RECENT PROJECTIONS BUT YOU KNOW

01:21:49.871 --> 01:21:51.306
THEIR MODEL THEY MODEL ARC

01:21:51.373 --> 01:21:52.741
STORM RIGHT WHICH IS JUST ONE

01:21:52.807 --> 01:21:56.978
FLOOD INCIDENT ALONE SEVEN

01:21:57.045 --> 01:21:57.545
HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE BILLION

01:21:57.612 --> 01:21:59.180
DOLLAR EVENT MEANTIME AT THE

01:21:59.247 --> 01:22:01.283
MOST CATASTROPHIC EVENT. IN THE

01:22:01.349 --> 01:22:03.652
NATION IS SITTING RIGHT HERE

01:22:03.718 --> 01:22:06.521
STARTING IN SACRAMENTO IF WE

01:22:06.588 --> 01:22:06.988
GET THE WRONG KIND OF

01:22:07.055 --> 01:22:08.390
ATMOSPHERE COLLISION ALL THE

01:22:08.456 --> 01:22:10.725
SAME TIME. THAT'S AN EXTREME

01:22:10.792 --> 01:22:12.727
EXAMPLE BUT IT'S A LIKELIHOOD

01:22:12.794 --> 01:22:14.696
ACCORDING THEIR MODELING- AND

01:22:14.763 --> 01:22:17.766
SO. WHAT WHAT EFFORTS HAVE WE

01:22:17.832 --> 01:22:20.068
MADE THIS SORT OF ANALYZE WHAT

01:22:20.135 --> 01:22:21.603
THOSE LONG TERM LIABILITIES

01:22:21.670 --> 01:22:23.405
COULD BE AND PLAN FOR THEM

01:22:23.471 --> 01:22:25.340
BECAUSE I'M LOOKING HERE. AT

01:22:25.407 --> 01:22:27.909
THE BUDGET STABILIZATION

01:22:27.976 --> 01:22:29.711
ACCOUNT OR EVEN THE SFE YOU

01:22:29.778 --> 01:22:30.912
RIGHT SPECIAL FUND FOR ECONOMIC

01:22:30.979 --> 01:22:32.480
UNCERTAINTIES WHERE IT A

01:22:32.547 --> 01:22:34.482
PROPOSED ONE POINT SIX BILLION

01:22:34.549 --> 01:22:37.452
OVERALL SAFETY NET INCLUDED

01:22:37.519 --> 01:22:38.453
ABOUT TWENTY TWENTY ONE

01:22:38.520 --> 01:22:41.022
BILLION. OKAY YOU ADD FIRE AND

01:22:41.089 --> 01:22:43.291
FLOOD ALONE HE WIPED THAT

01:22:43.358 --> 01:22:44.759
FORGET RAINY DAY FUND FLOOD

01:22:44.826 --> 01:22:46.361
FUND  WIPE

01:22:46.428 --> 01:22:48.596
SO WE STARTED LOOKING AT THIS

01:22:48.663 --> 01:22:50.665
QUESTION THROUGH A DEPARTMENT

01:22:50.732 --> 01:22:52.067
OF FINANCE SURE SO I CAN SPEAK

01:22:52.133 --> 01:22:53.301
TO THAT SO WE'RE CERTAINLY

01:22:53.368 --> 01:22:54.769
THINKING SERIOUSLY ABOUT ALL

01:22:54.836 --> 01:22:56.738
THE RISKS- I DON'T KNOW THAT WE

01:22:56.805 --> 01:22:57.906
HAD THE KIND OF THAT

01:22:57.972 --> 01:22:59.341
QUANTIFICATION EFFORT THAT I

01:22:59.407 --> 01:23:00.809
KNOW GUY YOU'VE DISCUSSED BUT

01:23:00.875 --> 01:23:01.576
ONE THING I WILL SAY THAT IS

01:23:01.643 --> 01:23:03.178
DIFFERENT FOR THIS YEAR. IS

01:23:03.244 --> 01:23:04.479
THAT I KNOW CENTER WHAT BECAUSE

01:23:04.546 --> 01:23:05.547
HE TALKED ABOUT THE CLIMATE

01:23:05.613 --> 01:23:07.015
BUDGET AND THAT SOME THAT'S NOT

01:23:07.082 --> 01:23:08.616
A TERM THAT WE'VE USED LAST

01:23:08.683 --> 01:23:10.085
YEAR THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE SEEN

01:23:10.151 --> 01:23:11.486
BEFORE AND THE REASON WE WANTED

01:23:11.553 --> 01:23:12.287
TO PUT ALL THOSE THINGS

01:23:12.354 --> 01:23:13.988
TOGETHER IS BECAUSE IT'S

01:23:14.055 --> 01:23:14.723
IMPORTANT EVEN THOUGH WE KNOW

01:23:14.789 --> 01:23:16.524
THIS PRIORITIES IMPORTANT THAT

01:23:16.591 --> 01:23:17.592
PRIORITIES IMPORTANT WE

01:23:17.659 --> 01:23:18.760
ACTUALLY WANTED TO LOOK AT

01:23:18.827 --> 01:23:19.828
EVERYTHING TOGETHER AND THAT

01:23:19.894 --> 01:23:21.963
WAY. WE ARE BASICALLY IN OUR

01:23:22.030 --> 01:23:24.065
PROPOSED SPENDING PLAN MAKING

01:23:24.132 --> 01:23:25.533
AN ASSESSMENT OF WHAT THE RISKS

01:23:25.600 --> 01:23:26.668
REALLY ARE AND WHERE WE'RE

01:23:26.735 --> 01:23:27.869
PUTTING A LOT OF MONEY AND SO

01:23:27.936 --> 01:23:29.671
THE THREE COMPONENTS OF THAT

01:23:29.738 --> 01:23:31.139
ARE THAT CLIMATE CATALYST FIND

01:23:31.206 --> 01:23:32.907
CAP AND TRADE AND THEN THE

01:23:32.974 --> 01:23:34.042
PROPOSED CLIMATE RESILIENCE

01:23:34.109 --> 01:23:35.343
BOND AND I KNOW THERE'S ALSO A

01:23:35.410 --> 01:23:36.845
PROPOSAL IN THE SENATE FOR

01:23:36.911 --> 01:23:37.946
SOMEWHERE BOND AND SO IF YOU

01:23:38.012 --> 01:23:40.014
LOOK AT THE ALLOCATION. OF OUR

01:23:40.081 --> 01:23:42.417
MONEY AMONG THOSE THREE POCKETS

01:23:42.484 --> 01:23:43.518
THAT'S WHERE YOU GET THE SENSE

01:23:43.585 --> 01:23:45.053
OF HOW THE MINISTRATION SEEING

01:23:45.120 --> 01:23:46.254
THEIR BREASTS AND WHERE WE WANT

01:23:46.321 --> 01:23:47.889
TO INVEST WE KNOW THAT THE

01:23:47.956 --> 01:23:49.157
FINAL APPLICATION AS WELL AS

01:23:49.224 --> 01:23:50.425
THE LEVEL OF THAT CLIMB RESULT

01:23:50.492 --> 01:23:54.295
FUNDING PARTICULAR WILL DEPEND

01:23:54.362 --> 01:23:59.634
ON THE- SENATE AND THE ASSEMBLY.

01:23:59.701 --> 01:24:02.103
COMMENTS HERE. ONE ONE THING I

01:24:02.170 --> 01:24:02.937
DON'T THAT WE THE THIS TIME

01:24:03.004 --> 01:24:03.571
NECESSARILY A GLOBAL LONG TERM

01:24:03.638 --> 01:24:04.305
ESTIMATE OF THE LATE OF KIND

01:24:04.372 --> 01:24:05.673
THAT YOU REFERRING TO BUT WHAT

01:24:05.740 --> 01:24:06.875
A COUPLE OF POINTS I WOULD MAKE

01:24:06.941 --> 01:24:09.744
IT- WE DID TAKE THAT THE

01:24:09.811 --> 01:24:11.679
POTENTIAL FOR SOME KIND OF A

01:24:11.746 --> 01:24:14.249
NATURAL DISASTER OCCURRING INTO

01:24:14.315 --> 01:24:15.750
ACCOUNT WHEN WE DID OUR FISCAL

01:24:15.817 --> 01:24:17.752
OUTLOOK IN NOVEMBER AND THERE

01:24:17.819 --> 01:24:19.687
IS THE YOU KNOW THE LIKELIHOOD

01:24:19.754 --> 01:24:21.022
OF GETTING- FEDERAL

01:24:21.089 --> 01:24:22.824
REIMBURSEMENTS TO FEMA SO WE

01:24:22.891 --> 01:24:25.593
ADDED. A BILLION OR TWO TO THE

01:24:25.660 --> 01:24:28.730
CAUSTIC COULD COME IN BE FELT

01:24:28.797 --> 01:24:30.865
BY THE STATE GENERAL FUND AND

01:24:30.932 --> 01:24:32.567
YOU KNOW I THINK JUST TO KIND

01:24:32.634 --> 01:24:35.804
OF REITERATE- POINT THAT EVEN

01:24:35.870 --> 01:24:36.838
ONE OR TWO OF THOSE KIND OF

01:24:36.905 --> 01:24:38.573
EVENTS COULD JEOPARDIZE THE

01:24:38.640 --> 01:24:40.909
OPERATING SURPLUS JUST IN THE

01:24:40.975 --> 01:24:43.344
NEAR TERM AND THAT'S ONLY ONE.

01:24:43.411 --> 01:24:44.245
YOU KNOW ONE OF THE RISKS THAT

01:24:44.312 --> 01:24:46.981
ARE OUT THERE- BUT CERTAINLY

01:24:47.048 --> 01:24:47.682
YOU KNOW I THINK MORE

01:24:47.749 --> 01:24:49.517
INFORMATION. OF THE KIND THAT

01:24:49.584 --> 01:24:50.585
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT IS

01:24:50.652 --> 01:24:51.920
PROBABLY YOU KNOW VERY

01:24:51.986 --> 01:24:55.023
IMPORTANT. I THINK WE'RE GONNA

01:24:55.089 --> 01:24:56.891
TRY TO DRILL DOWN FURTHER ON

01:24:56.958 --> 01:24:58.126
THAT AND SUBSEQUENT HEARINGS

01:24:58.193 --> 01:24:59.761
AND I KNOW OF I THINK OUR OUR

01:24:59.828 --> 01:25:02.163
FIRST SPECIFIC HEARING WILL BE

01:25:02.230 --> 01:25:04.065
ON CLIMATE SO HOPEFULLY WE CAN.

01:25:04.132 --> 01:25:06.401
SO WILL DRILL DOWN MORE ON THAT

01:25:06.468 --> 01:25:08.603
THEN BUT- I WOULD I WOULD JUST

01:25:08.670 --> 01:25:11.673
CLOSE AT THAT POINT BY SAYING.

01:25:11.739 --> 01:25:12.774
THE REACTIVE INSERT A

01:25:12.841 --> 01:25:14.709
RESPONSIVE CAPACITY DO DISASTER

01:25:14.776 --> 01:25:16.277
IS ONE THING ANSWER TO HAVING

01:25:16.344 --> 01:25:17.512
THAT SURGE CAPACITY BUILT IN

01:25:17.579 --> 01:25:19.714
SAY WE GET. AN INCIDENT I MEAN

01:25:19.781 --> 01:25:20.715
I THINK WE DID FIVE BILLION

01:25:20.782 --> 01:25:22.217
LAST YEAR IN WILD FIRE RESPONSE

01:25:22.283 --> 01:25:24.185
OF WE GET HIT. OUT OF THE BLUE

01:25:24.252 --> 01:25:25.720
WITH ANOTHER SERIES FIRES IN A

01:25:25.787 --> 01:25:27.589
FLOOD. IF TO COME UP WITH

01:25:27.655 --> 01:25:28.590
FIFTEEN BUT I'M REALLY

01:25:28.656 --> 01:25:29.824
INTERESTING HOW WE BY DOWN THAT

01:25:29.891 --> 01:25:32.560
RISK. RIGHT AND LOOKING AT THE

01:25:35.730 --> 01:25:37.465
HOW WE'RE GOING TO BE. TRYING

01:25:37.532 --> 01:25:38.099
TO ANALYZE IT FROM OUR

01:25:38.166 --> 01:25:39.968
PERSPECTIVE AND I THINK THAT

01:25:40.034 --> 01:25:42.203
REALLY OUGHT TO BE THE TEST. IF

01:25:42.270 --> 01:25:43.671
YOU'RE GONNA SPEND FIVE BILLION

01:25:43.738 --> 01:25:44.572

THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF RISKS

01:26:33.521 --> 01:26:34.522

ABOUT THE FEASIBILITY OF

01:27:26.574 --> 01:27:30.712
PUTTING TOGETHER- A PLAN. TO

01:27:30.778 --> 01:27:32.513
LOOK AT THE RATE STUDY

01:27:32.580 --> 01:27:34.983
IMPLEMENTATION AND HOW WE

01:27:35.049 --> 01:27:36.985
ACTUALLY START TO MEET THIS.

01:27:37.051 --> 01:27:38.453
HUGE GAP WERE FRANKLY FACING ON

01:27:38.519 --> 01:27:40.188
DELIVERING THOSE SERVICES SO

01:27:40.254 --> 01:27:42.624
JUST TO GET A SENSE- SO WE

01:27:42.690 --> 01:27:43.992
DON'T SIR TO CHASE IT YEAR

01:27:44.058 --> 01:27:46.761
AFTER YEAR BUT- WHEN YOU GET

01:27:46.828 --> 01:27:48.496
YOUR FEEL FOR THE FEASIBILITY

01:27:48.563 --> 01:27:49.631
OF PUTTING THAT KIND OF PLAN

01:27:49.697 --> 01:27:52.867
TOGETHER TO GIVE OURSELVES- A

01:27:52.934 --> 01:27:55.336
RUNWAY FOR HOW WE ACTUALLY FILL

01:27:55.403 --> 01:27:58.039
THIS GAP AND- NOT. CREATE FALSE

01:27:58.106 --> 01:27:59.741
HOPE IN A GOOD YEAR AND THEN

01:27:59.807 --> 01:28:01.609
DASH EVERYONE'S HOPES IN IN IN

01:28:01.676 --> 01:28:03.011
THE YEAR AFTER THIS VERY

01:28:03.077 --> 01:28:04.345
VULNERABLE PEOPLE COUNTING ON

01:28:04.412 --> 01:28:05.947
US HERE SO I'LL MAKE TWO

01:28:06.014 --> 01:28:06.848
COMMENTS AND THEN MY CALLING

01:28:06.914 --> 01:28:08.316
THE ELABORATE AS WELL I THINK

01:28:08.383 --> 01:28:10.184
THE FIRST IS THAT. THE LAST

01:28:10.251 --> 01:28:12.220
YEAR'S BUDGET ACT INCLUDED A

01:28:12.286 --> 01:28:12.787
HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE MILLION

01:28:12.854 --> 01:28:14.389
DOLLARS AND IT'LL BE TWO

01:28:14.455 --> 01:28:15.123
HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS

01:28:15.189 --> 01:28:16.724
ON AN ANNUAL BASIS- FOR THESE

01:28:16.791 --> 01:28:18.693
RATE INCREASES. AND THEN THERE

01:28:18.760 --> 01:28:19.794
WERE THREE SERVICE CODES THAT

01:28:19.861 --> 01:28:20.995
WERE NOT FUNDED TO THIS BUDGET

01:28:21.062 --> 01:28:22.363
INCLUDES NEARLY ELEVEN MILLION

01:28:22.430 --> 01:28:24.265
DOLLARS ON TOP OF THAT AND SO

01:28:24.332 --> 01:28:25.533
THAT WILL HELP US MAKE PROGRESS

01:28:25.600 --> 01:28:27.502
ON THE RATE- STUDY INCREASES

01:28:27.568 --> 01:28:29.203
THAT YOU MENTIONED WE ALSO HAVE

01:28:29.270 --> 01:28:29.971
ADDITIONAL MONEY FOR

01:28:30.038 --> 01:28:31.172
PERFORMANCE BECAUSE ULTIMATELY

01:28:31.239 --> 01:28:32.373
THAT'S ALL. THAT'S THE PURPOSE

01:28:32.440 --> 01:28:33.941
OF INCREASING RATES AS WELL AS

01:28:34.008 --> 01:28:36.044
TO INCREASE ACCESS TO SERVICES

01:28:36.110 --> 01:28:37.178
AND GET BETTER PERFORMANCE

01:28:37.245 --> 01:28:38.579
METRICS AND OUTCOMES FOR

01:28:38.646 --> 01:28:40.381
PEOPLE- BUT THE SECOND THING ON

01:28:40.448 --> 01:28:41.983
THE LONGER TERM YOU KNOW WE'RE

01:28:42.050 --> 01:28:43.584
VERY CONSCIOUS OF THIS AND- YOU

01:28:43.651 --> 01:28:44.352
KNOW WE KNOW WE HAVE THE

01:28:44.419 --> 01:28:46.454
SUSPENSIONS IN THE BUDGET ACT

01:28:46.521 --> 01:28:47.889
LAST YEAR. AND THOSE HAVE BEEN

01:28:47.955 --> 01:28:49.924
DELAYED NOW BY EIGHTEEN MONTHS

01:28:49.991 --> 01:28:52.026
TO THE SUMMER OF TWENTY TWENTY

01:28:52.093 --> 01:28:52.660
THREE BUT WE CERTAINLY SEE THAT

01:28:52.727 --> 01:28:53.561
ON THE CALENDAR AND WE WANT TO

01:28:53.628 --> 01:28:55.096
FIND A WAY WHERE THAT STATE

01:28:55.163 --> 01:28:56.397
GOVERNMENT WOULD NOT HAVE TO DO

01:28:56.464 --> 01:28:57.932
THAT- SO WE'RE CONSTANTLY

01:28:57.999 --> 01:28:59.634
UPDATING OUR PROJECTIONS BOTH

01:28:59.701 --> 01:29:00.601
IN TERMS OF THE GENERAL MULTI

01:29:00.668 --> 01:29:02.036
YEAR. AND SPECIFICALLY THIS

01:29:02.103 --> 01:29:03.438
CATEGORY SPENDING TO SEE WHAT

01:29:03.504 --> 01:29:05.239
WE CAN DO OVER THE NEXT COUPLE

01:29:05.306 --> 01:29:08.509
OF YEARS AND TURN OVER TO MY

01:29:08.576 --> 01:29:10.778

01:29:21.856 --> 01:29:23.691
NEED TO. LOOK AT SYSTEM REFORM

WOULD LOOK LIKE IN THE FUTURE

01:30:32.994 --> 01:30:34.629

01:30:53.314 --> 01:30:55.683
TO MAKE THE BALLOT SHEET

01:30:55.750 --> 01:30:58.419
SHOWING THE EXPENDITURES VERSES

01:30:58.486 --> 01:31:00.054
THE COST REDUCTIONS O I JUST

01:31:00.121 --> 01:31:01.556
GIVE THE PRISON CLOSURE AS AN

01:31:01.622 --> 01:31:03.491
EXAMPLE THERE MAY BE OTHERS BUT

01:31:03.558 --> 01:31:05.526
I THINK IT'S WORTH IT FOR US TO

01:31:05.593 --> 01:31:07.128
SEE AT THE SAME TIME WE'RE

01:31:07.195 --> 01:31:09.764
BALANCING HEY WAIT A MINUTE MAY

01:31:09.831 --> 01:31:10.264
WE SHOULDN'T PURSUE. NEW

01:31:10.331 --> 01:31:12.867
SPENDING. IN WHAT WAYS ARE NEW

01:31:12.934 --> 01:31:14.669
INVESTMENTS POTENTIALLY GOING

01:31:14.735 --> 01:31:16.737
TO BRING DOWN OUR COSTS IN THE

01:31:16.804 --> 01:31:18.573
FUTURE. AND THEN ADDITIONALLY

01:31:18.639 --> 01:31:21.008
WHEN I LOOK AT SOME OF THE

01:31:21.075 --> 01:31:22.944
PROPOSED NEW EXPENDITURES.

01:31:23.010 --> 01:31:25.780
THERE REALLY VERY RESPONSIVE TO

01:31:25.847 --> 01:31:28.883
CALIFORNIANS- YOU KNOW AT A

01:31:28.950 --> 01:31:31.219
VERY STRONG DESIRES IF WE LOOK

01:31:31.285 --> 01:31:33.321
AT POLLS IF WE LOOK AT OUR OWN

01:31:33.387 --> 01:31:34.889
EXPERIENCE IN OUR DISTRICTS

01:31:34.956 --> 01:31:37.525
WHETHER IT'S- THE- HOMELESSNESS

01:31:37.592 --> 01:31:40.328
CRISIS WHICH AGAIN IS. ACROSS

01:31:40.394 --> 01:31:42.563
THE STATE. REALLY BUT

01:31:42.630 --> 01:31:44.165
CALIFORNIANS HAVE SAID LOUD AND

01:31:44.232 --> 01:31:46.367
CLEAR WE WANT THIS FIXED WE

01:31:46.434 --> 01:31:48.603
WANT THIS ADDRESSED. AND THEN I

01:31:48.669 --> 01:31:50.938
THINK BACK WHILE ALIVE- WELL I

01:31:51.005 --> 01:31:52.740
CAN'T TURN TO A PARTICULAR POLL

01:31:52.807 --> 01:31:54.775
AT THIS MOMENT AROUND. DRUG

01:31:54.842 --> 01:31:57.211
COSTS I THINK WE COLLECTIVELY

01:31:57.278 --> 01:31:58.045
KNOWN IF WE WERE TO DO ONE

01:31:58.112 --> 01:32:01.816
TOMORROW- NOBODY LOOKS THEIR

01:32:01.883 --> 01:32:04.018
HIGH COST OF DRUGS. AND AIDING

01:32:04.085 --> 01:32:07.488
WE KNOW THAT OUR OWN ANALYSIS

01:32:07.555 --> 01:32:10.291
OF THE COSTA MEDI CAL. DUE TO

01:32:10.358 --> 01:32:12.827
THESE REALLY OUTRAGEOUS

01:32:12.894 --> 01:32:14.996
PRESCRIPTION COSTS AND WE'VE

01:32:15.062 --> 01:32:16.130
NOT GOTTEN THE TYPE OF

01:32:16.197 --> 01:32:17.598
REDUCTIONS THAT THE FEDERAL

01:32:17.665 --> 01:32:19.400
GOVERNMENT PROMISED US WE'VE

01:32:19.467 --> 01:32:21.636
NOT GOTTEN THOSE SO I THINK IT

01:32:21.702 --> 01:32:23.237
IS VERY RESPONSIVE FOR

01:32:23.304 --> 01:32:24.538
CALIFORNIA IF WE CAN ACHIEVE

01:32:24.605 --> 01:32:26.340
IT. TO MOVE IN THAT DIRECTION

01:32:26.407 --> 01:32:28.109
AND COULD GIVE US SOME COST

01:32:28.175 --> 01:32:29.844
REDUCTIONS SO. I'VE THE

01:32:29.911 --> 01:32:31.779
INTEREST I HAVE IS BOTH IN WHAT

01:32:31.846 --> 01:32:33.381
WAYS MIGHT SOME OF THIS NEW

01:32:33.447 --> 01:32:35.616
SPENDING BRING US DOWN COSTS

01:32:35.683 --> 01:32:37.919
AND THEN ADDITIONALLY THE MAYBE

01:32:37.985 --> 01:32:42.556
THIS ISN'T FOR IMMEDIATE. BUT

01:32:42.623 --> 01:32:45.092
WHEN WE LOOK AT OUR A THIS NEWS.

01:32:45.159 --> 01:32:46.894
COULD INCREASE ONGOING GENERAL

01:32:46.961 --> 01:32:48.562
FUND THAT'S THE ASSUMPTION THAT

01:32:48.629 --> 01:32:49.630
WE'RE JUST GOING TO KEEP ON

01:32:49.697 --> 01:32:51.933
GOING GENERAL FUND AS IT IS AND

01:32:51.999 --> 01:32:53.534
I THINK IT'S ALWAYS WORTH IT TO

01:32:53.601 --> 01:32:55.469
LOOK BACK AT THERE COULD BE

01:32:55.536 --> 01:32:58.406
SOME. SOME ONGOING GENERAL FUND

01:32:58.472 --> 01:33:00.007
CLEARLY NOT IN K. TWELVE

01:33:00.074 --> 01:33:01.842
SCHOOLS NOT IN A FEW OTHER

01:33:01.909 --> 01:33:03.611
AREAS BUT THAT ARE KIND OF

01:33:03.678 --> 01:33:06.514
REDUNDANT NOW OR NOT REALLY YOU

01:33:06.580 --> 01:33:08.349
KNOW AS MUCH AS WE KNOW THAT WE

01:33:08.416 --> 01:33:09.884
NEED SOME NEW SPENDING IN SOME

01:33:09.951 --> 01:33:11.986
AREAS THAT RE REALLY. DIRE

01:33:12.053 --> 01:33:14.221
NEEDS NOW MAYBE THERE'S SOME

01:33:14.288 --> 01:33:17.158
SPENDING THAT ISN'T AND OF

01:33:17.224 --> 01:33:18.092
COURSE WE DON'T HAVE THE

01:33:18.159 --> 01:33:19.660
PRESSURE TO MAKE A CUT AT THE

01:33:19.727 --> 01:33:21.929
MOMENT AS WE DID DURING THE

01:33:21.996 --> 01:33:24.298
RECESSION BUT IDENTIFYING WHICH

01:33:24.365 --> 01:33:27.201
ONES WHICH AREAS MAYBE DON'T

01:33:27.268 --> 01:33:29.303
HAVE AS MUCH JUSTIFICATION NOW

01:33:29.370 --> 01:33:31.472
SO AS WE THINK INTO THE FUTURE.

01:33:31.539 --> 01:33:33.507
THAT WAY I THINK WOULD BE

01:33:33.574 --> 01:33:37.345
HELPFUL. FIVE AND FOR ALL GIVE

01:33:37.411 --> 01:33:40.214
ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF WHAT I THINK.

01:33:40.281 --> 01:33:41.716
THE A YOU KNOW AGAIN WE HAVE TO

01:33:41.782 --> 01:33:43.117
GET IN OUR WHOLE DISCUSSION AS

01:33:43.184 --> 01:33:45.619
A LEGISLATURE BUT I THINK THE

01:33:45.686 --> 01:33:46.320
DEPARTMENT OF EARLY CARE AND

01:33:46.387 --> 01:33:49.156
EDUCATION. I THINK THAT THE

01:33:49.223 --> 01:33:51.392
RESEARCH SHOWS US THAT

01:33:51.459 --> 01:33:54.428
CALIFORNIA. DIRECTING BEING

01:33:54.495 --> 01:33:57.098
SMARTER ABOUT INVESTMENTS THERE

01:33:57.164 --> 01:33:59.066
WHILE IT WON'T GIVE US BUDGET

01:33:59.133 --> 01:34:01.435
SAVINGS IN A SINGLE YEAR. COULD

01:34:01.502 --> 01:34:03.671
IN FACT GIVE US GREAT

01:34:03.738 --> 01:34:06.640
REDUCTIONS IN OUR IN SPECIAL

01:34:06.707 --> 01:34:08.809
EDUCATION SPENDING FOR EXAMPLE

01:34:08.876 --> 01:34:11.479
IF WE IF QUALITY EARLY CARE AND

01:34:11.545 --> 01:34:13.014
EDUCATION HELPS US IDENTIFY

01:34:13.080 --> 01:34:14.448
KIDS SPECIAL NEED MOM FAR

01:34:14.515 --> 01:34:16.183
EARLIER. COULD GIVE US GREAT

01:34:16.250 --> 01:34:18.686
REDUCTIONS IN CRIMINAL JUSTICE

01:34:18.753 --> 01:34:22.523
AGAIN WE KNOW THAT- MANY OF OUR

01:34:22.590 --> 01:34:23.157
FOLKS WHETHER THEY'RE IN JAIL

01:34:23.224 --> 01:34:27.595
OR PRISON. IF THEY HAD THE- FOR

01:34:27.661 --> 01:34:30.631
EXAMPLE. CAN'T READ THEY DON'T

01:34:30.698 --> 01:34:33.167
HAVE FULL LITERACY SO WHAT HOW

01:34:33.234 --> 01:34:35.603
I MEAN HOW ONE COULD IMAGINE

01:34:35.669 --> 01:34:38.072
BEING ABLE TO FUNCTION WELL IN

01:34:38.139 --> 01:34:40.808
OUR CULTURE SO IF YOU IF YOU IF

01:34:40.875 --> 01:34:42.109
OUR SCHOOL SYSTEM AND I'M NOT

01:34:42.176 --> 01:34:43.411
TRYING TO POINT FINGERS AT OUR

01:34:43.477 --> 01:34:45.146
SCHOOLS BUT AGAIN IF YOU HAD A

01:34:45.212 --> 01:34:47.214
CIRCUMSTANCE WHERE. THAT WAS

01:34:47.281 --> 01:34:49.683
NOT ADDRESSED OR TENDED TO

01:34:49.750 --> 01:34:52.253
WHICH THEN BASICALLY YOUR

01:34:52.319 --> 01:34:57.224
MASKING AND LEAD TO YOU CANNOT-

01:34:57.291 --> 01:35:00.561
FUNCTION WITHIN OUR JOB TYPE

01:35:00.628 --> 01:35:01.228
BASED ECONOMY AND EVERYTHING IN

01:35:01.295 --> 01:35:04.231
A WAY THAT. YOU CAN PUT YOU IN

01:35:04.298 --> 01:35:06.233
SITUATIONS THAT LATER COST US A

01:35:06.300 --> 01:35:09.036
LOT. SO I THINK THAT THOSE

01:35:09.103 --> 01:35:10.871
KINDS OF NEW DEPARTMENTS AND

01:35:10.938 --> 01:35:13.207
AGAIN WE STILL HAVE TO DEBATED

01:35:13.274 --> 01:35:14.842
WORKING THROUGH MIGHT BE

01:35:14.909 --> 01:35:17.378
EXACTLY THE THING THAT THE

01:35:17.445 --> 01:35:20.281
STATE NEEDS RIGHT NOW TO BE

01:35:20.347 --> 01:35:24.018
MORE ATTUNED TO WHAT WE KNOW

01:35:24.085 --> 01:35:26.620
ABOUT. HUMAN DEVELOPMENT IN THE

01:35:26.687 --> 01:35:28.189
BECAUSE OF CERTAIN OF OUR OTHER

01:35:28.255 --> 01:35:31.092
LATER. LATER INCREASED EXPENSES

01:35:31.158 --> 01:35:33.260
WHETHER IN SOCIAL SERVICE AREAS

01:35:33.327 --> 01:35:35.096
EDUCATION AREAS OR CRIMINAL

01:35:35.162 --> 01:35:38.666
JUSTICE SERIOUS AND SIMILARLY.

01:35:38.732 --> 01:35:40.601
ARE MOVE TOWARDS THE CHANGES IN

01:35:40.668 --> 01:35:44.538
JUVENILE JUSTICE AGAIN WE WE'RE

01:35:44.605 --> 01:35:49.343
WE ARE MAKING THE- ALL THEN

01:35:49.410 --> 01:35:51.212
WHEN USE GAMBLE THOUGH I SAID

01:35:51.278 --> 01:35:55.049
IT ALREADY. BUT WE THE RESEARCH

01:35:55.116 --> 01:35:58.886
SHOWS US THAT A LOT OF YOUNG

01:35:58.953 --> 01:36:01.255
PEOPLE ARE THEY ARE NOT

01:36:01.322 --> 01:36:03.958
INCORRIGIBLE AND SO THE

01:36:04.024 --> 01:36:07.695
APPROPRIATE INVESTMENTS TO MOVE

01:36:07.761 --> 01:36:09.363
THEM AWAY FROM A BAD DECISION

01:36:09.430 --> 01:36:11.432
THEY MAY HAVE MADE CAN

01:36:11.499 --> 01:36:12.867
REPURPOSE GREAT BENEFITS INTO

01:36:12.933 --> 01:36:14.268
THE FUTURE THAT'S WHAT THE

01:36:14.335 --> 01:36:16.003
RESEARCH IN THE DATA SHOWS AND

01:36:16.070 --> 01:36:19.306
THAT'S HOW I SEE THIS MOVEMENT

01:36:19.373 --> 01:36:21.408
INVESTMENTS IN. THE JUVENILE

01:36:21.475 --> 01:36:22.910
JUSTICE SYSTEM REFORMS THAT

01:36:22.977 --> 01:36:24.044
WE'VE BEEN DOING AND SWITCHING

01:36:24.111 --> 01:36:25.579
THE JUVENILE JUSTICE TO HEALTH

01:36:25.646 --> 01:36:27.414
AND HUMAN SERVICES FOR EXAMPLE

01:36:27.481 --> 01:36:28.716
BUT I THINK THAT THAT IT WOULD

01:36:28.782 --> 01:36:30.217
HELP US TO HAVE SOME ANALYSIS

01:36:30.284 --> 01:36:32.419
THAT IS MORE THAN JUST O. OKAY

01:36:32.486 --> 01:36:35.389
LOOK BETTER WATCH. BY YOUR

01:36:35.456 --> 01:36:37.591
INCREASED ONGOING EXPENDITURES

01:36:37.658 --> 01:36:39.760
SO THAT'S KIND OF MY GENERAL

01:36:39.827 --> 01:36:43.464
COMMENT THEN SOME SPECIFICS-

01:36:43.531 --> 01:36:46.000
VERY HAPPY THAT OUR K. THROUGH

01:36:46.066 --> 01:36:49.170
TWELVE SCHOOLS. HAVE GREAT

01:36:49.236 --> 01:36:50.905
INCREASE SPENDING OF COURSE WE

01:36:50.971 --> 01:36:54.208
KNOW EVEN WITH OUR YOU KNOW

01:36:54.275 --> 01:36:57.111
EVEN WITH A GOOD GENERAL FUND

01:36:57.178 --> 01:36:59.079
OUR PER PUPIL SPENDING IS STILL

01:36:59.146 --> 01:37:01.115
NOT WHAT IS REALLY NEEDED I

01:37:01.182 --> 01:37:03.083
DON'T KNOW HOW WE ADDRESS THAT

01:37:03.150 --> 01:37:04.885
WITHOUT SOME REAL STRUCTURAL

01:37:04.952 --> 01:37:06.453
CHANGES WITHIN OUR WHOLE

01:37:06.520 --> 01:37:07.988
REVENUE SYSTEM BUT I'M VERY

01:37:08.055 --> 01:37:09.757
HAPPY TO SEE THE INCREASES. AND

01:37:09.823 --> 01:37:11.859
I WANT TO END THE INCREASE TO

01:37:11.926 --> 01:37:13.827
SPECIAL ED. VERY IMPORTANT AND

01:37:13.894 --> 01:37:15.129
THEN ADDITIONALLY WASN'T

01:37:15.196 --> 01:37:16.931
MENTIONED IN OUR OVERVIEW BUT I

01:37:16.997 --> 01:37:19.300
NOTICED THERE'S A PROPOSAL IN

01:37:19.366 --> 01:37:21.302
THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET AROUND.

01:37:21.368 --> 01:37:23.170
AN INCREASE TO THE

01:37:23.237 --> 01:37:24.238
REIMBURSEMENT RATE FOR SCHOOL

01:37:24.305 --> 01:37:27.007
MEALS. AND I THINK AGAIN THAT

01:37:27.074 --> 01:37:29.777
ONE IS- IS ONE OF THOSE WHERE

01:37:29.843 --> 01:37:30.878
YEAH IT'S INCREASE SPENDING BUT

01:37:30.945 --> 01:37:33.247
AGAIN WE KNOW THAT A LARGE

01:37:33.314 --> 01:37:35.716
PERCENT OF OUR KIDS. GET MOST

01:37:35.783 --> 01:37:37.952
OF THEIR MEALS AT SCHOOL SO

01:37:38.018 --> 01:37:40.187
THEY'RE IN THE FACT RECEIVING

01:37:40.254 --> 01:37:42.556
THEIR CALORIES AND NUTRITION AT

01:37:42.623 --> 01:37:44.925
SCHOOL SO IF WE CAN. ENSURE

01:37:44.992 --> 01:37:46.694
THAT THAT CALORIES IN THE

01:37:46.760 --> 01:37:48.128
NUTRITION IS THE HIGHEST

01:37:48.195 --> 01:37:50.297
QUALITY WE KNOW WE WILL GET

01:37:50.364 --> 01:37:51.999
BETTER HEALTH AND EDUCATION

01:37:52.066 --> 01:37:53.901
OUTCOME SO I JUST WANT TO KNOW

01:37:53.968 --> 01:37:54.702
THAT I WAS REALLY HAPPY TO SEE

01:37:54.768 --> 01:37:57.538
THAT- IN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE.

01:37:57.605 --> 01:38:00.941
IN OUR- RELY ON OUR ON BUDGET I

01:38:01.008 --> 01:38:03.544
THINK SO OF ONE CHAIR TO BE

01:38:03.611 --> 01:38:04.245
GETTING INTO SOME OF THESE

01:38:04.311 --> 01:38:05.813
DETAILS BUT I NOTICED THE

01:38:05.879 --> 01:38:08.148
APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM. AND FOR

01:38:08.215 --> 01:38:08.983
ONE I'LL BE INTERESTED TO SEE

01:38:09.049 --> 01:38:10.718
WHETHER THOSE WHERE THERE THAT

01:38:10.784 --> 01:38:11.852
PROPOSAL IN THE COMMUNITY

01:38:11.919 --> 01:38:13.520
COLLEGE APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM

01:38:13.587 --> 01:38:16.156
IS GEOGRAPHIC SPECIFIC OR JUST

01:38:16.223 --> 01:38:18.492
ALL ACROSS THE STATE. AND I

01:38:18.559 --> 01:38:23.831
NOTED BECAUSE- WE- LAST YEAR.

01:38:23.897 --> 01:38:26.634
WE HAD WE LOTS OF JOB GROWTH

01:38:26.700 --> 01:38:29.803
AND WHAT TO JOBS. IN CALIFORNIA

01:38:29.870 --> 01:38:31.805
AND WE HAVE LOW UNEMPLOYMENT

01:38:31.872 --> 01:38:34.074
BUT WE HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE IN

01:38:34.141 --> 01:38:35.976
LOW WAGE JOBS AND THERE'S

01:38:36.043 --> 01:38:38.779
GROWTH IN HIGHER WAGE JOBS AND

01:38:38.846 --> 01:38:40.547
IF WE CAN TAILOR. AND I'M

01:38:40.614 --> 01:38:41.882
ASSUMING THAT THAT'S WHAT THE

01:38:41.949 --> 01:38:42.950
PURPOSE OF THESE APPRENTICESHIP

01:38:43.017 --> 01:38:44.585
PROGRAMS ARE IF WE CAN TAILOR

01:38:44.652 --> 01:38:46.620
MORE OF OUR- JOB TRAINING AND

01:38:46.687 --> 01:38:48.622
APPRENTICESHIPS TOWARDS THOSE

01:38:48.689 --> 01:38:51.058
HIGHER WAGE JOBS. THEN WE CAN

01:38:51.125 --> 01:38:54.094
ASSIST. THE FOLKS IN OUR STATE

01:38:54.161 --> 01:38:55.562
UNFORTUNATELY SO MANY THAT ARE

01:38:55.629 --> 01:38:56.964
IN THESE LOW WAGE JOBS AND I

01:38:57.031 --> 01:38:57.965
JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:38:58.032 --> 01:39:02.736
IT'S SURGICAL. AND SO I'LL- IS

01:39:02.803 --> 01:39:04.471
IT'S NOT MY SEVEN COMMITTEE I

01:39:04.538 --> 01:39:08.008
WILL ASK MY- CHAIR OF THAT TO

01:39:08.075 --> 01:39:10.477
DIG DOWN INTO THAT TO HELP SOME

01:39:10.544 --> 01:39:12.913
OF US. IN A MAKING OUR DECISION

01:39:12.980 --> 01:39:15.149
AROUND IT- AND THEN IN THE

01:39:15.215 --> 01:39:18.218
CLIMATE BUDGET. AGAIN I'M NOT

01:39:18.285 --> 01:39:19.953
OPPOSED TO NEW AREAS OF

01:39:20.020 --> 01:39:22.289
SPENDING THEIR OR EVEN TO AN

01:39:22.356 --> 01:39:24.224
INCREASE IN OUR AUCTION REVENUE

01:39:24.291 --> 01:39:25.793
BUT I WAS A LITTLE CONCERNED

01:39:25.859 --> 01:39:28.295
ABOUT THE REDUCTIONS IN AB SIX

01:39:28.362 --> 01:39:30.764
SEVENTEEN FUNDING. THE

01:39:30.831 --> 01:39:33.067
REDUCTIONS IN MONIES THAT WILL

01:39:33.133 --> 01:39:35.102
HELP MOVE US OFF FOSSIL FUEL TO

01:39:35.169 --> 01:39:39.440
DIESEL AND THE REDUCTIONS-

01:39:39.506 --> 01:39:41.442
WHICH WHICH INCLUDED SOME OF

01:39:41.508 --> 01:39:43.110
THE ACT THINGS BUT ALSO THE

01:39:43.177 --> 01:39:44.378
HEAVY AND MEDIUM DUTY DUTY

01:39:44.445 --> 01:39:47.414
VEHICLES. ARM AND ARE ZERO

01:39:47.481 --> 01:39:48.482
EMISSION VEHICLES AND THE

01:39:48.549 --> 01:39:50.351
REASON I RAISE IT IS BECAUSE

01:39:50.417 --> 01:39:53.721
NOT ONLY ARE THOSE AREAS STILL

01:39:53.787 --> 01:39:55.989
HUGE CONTRIBUTORS TO OUR

01:39:56.056 --> 01:39:58.892
GREENHOUSE GAS PROBLEMS. THEY

01:39:58.959 --> 01:40:00.894
ARE THE AREAS THAT MAKE ART

01:40:00.961 --> 01:40:03.297
HERE THE MOST UNHEALTHY AND WE

01:40:03.364 --> 01:40:06.400
STILL HAVE IN CALIFORNIA IF WE

01:40:06.467 --> 01:40:08.535
TAKE THE TEN CITIES ACROSS THE

01:40:08.602 --> 01:40:10.871
US WITH THE WORST AIR POLLUTION

01:40:10.938 --> 01:40:11.772
SEVEN OF THEM ARE IN

01:40:11.839 --> 01:40:14.208
CALIFORNIA. SO I'M A LITTLE

01:40:14.274 --> 01:40:16.377
CONCERNED ABOUT REDUCTIONS IN

01:40:16.443 --> 01:40:19.146
THE G. G. R. F. THAT ARE THAT

01:40:19.213 --> 01:40:21.482
WILL ALSO HURT OUR OUTCOMES

01:40:21.548 --> 01:40:24.518
FROM AIR QUALITY- AND THEN

01:40:24.585 --> 01:40:27.988
LASTLY ON THE HOMELESSNESS. YOU

01:40:28.055 --> 01:40:30.190
KNOW RIGHT NOW MOST OF IT. IT'S

01:40:30.257 --> 01:40:31.125
NOT JUST ADDRESSING

01:40:31.191 --> 01:40:32.993
HOMELESSNESS WHO ARE PEOPLE WHO

01:40:33.060 --> 01:40:34.661
ARE ALREADY HOMELESS BUT ALSO

01:40:34.728 --> 01:40:36.764
IT IS KEEPING OUR CALIFORNIANS

01:40:36.830 --> 01:40:38.031
HOUSED WHO MIGHT BE ON THE

01:40:38.098 --> 01:40:39.833
BRINK BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT THAT

01:40:39.900 --> 01:40:41.835
INVESTMENT AND I'M VERY GLAD

01:40:41.902 --> 01:40:43.670
GOVERNOR RECOGNIZED IT AND THAT

01:40:43.737 --> 01:40:48.409
THE- COMMITTEE THAT. OF MAYOR

01:40:48.475 --> 01:40:51.412
STEINBERG AND- THE LA COUNTY

01:40:51.478 --> 01:40:54.014
YES A RIDLEY THOMAS ARE TEARING

01:40:54.081 --> 01:40:55.616
HAVE ALSO RECOGNIZED THAT

01:40:55.682 --> 01:40:57.584
INVESTMENTS IN KEEPING FOLKS

01:40:57.651 --> 01:40:59.720
HOUSE IS REALLY SMART REALLY

01:40:59.787 --> 01:41:02.389
WISE. BUT I KNOW THAT MOST OF

01:41:02.456 --> 01:41:04.258
IT IN THIS BUDGET IS ONE TIME.

01:41:04.324 --> 01:41:05.759
WE'RE NOT GONNA SOLVE THIS

01:41:05.826 --> 01:41:07.728
PROBLEM IN THIS YEAR THAT MAY

01:41:07.795 --> 01:41:09.630
BE AN AREA THAT NEEDS TO BE ON

01:41:09.696 --> 01:41:15.669
GOING SO I'LL LEAVE IT AT THAT.

01:41:15.736 --> 01:41:16.537
THREE IN THE EXPECTATION ABOUT

01:41:16.603 --> 01:41:18.272
A RESPONSE- SKINNER FROM IF

01:41:18.338 --> 01:41:20.307
THEY WANT TO BUT OTHERWISE IT'S

01:41:20.374 --> 01:41:24.111
A MORE A MORE. MY OVERVIEW.

01:41:24.178 --> 01:41:26.046
ALRIGHT WE WILL TAKE ALL THAT

01:41:26.113 --> 01:41:27.548
FEEDBACK BACK TO OUR IS

01:41:27.614 --> 01:41:29.650
DEPENDING- THE COMMON AND SEEMS

01:41:29.716 --> 01:41:31.351
WHETHER IT WOULD BE OKAY IF THE

01:41:31.418 --> 01:41:32.753
LA- FELT LIKE THEY COULD DO THE

01:41:32.820 --> 01:41:35.923
KIND OF. THAT KIND OF EXERCISE.

01:41:35.989 --> 01:41:37.458
YES SENATOR SKINNER I THINK

01:41:37.524 --> 01:41:39.126
WHAT YOU ARE RAISING IS A

01:41:39.193 --> 01:41:42.996
REALLY IMPORTANT- CONCEPT. AND

01:41:43.063 --> 01:41:44.832
IT'S SOMETHING THAT I MAY NOT

01:41:44.898 --> 01:41:47.634
IN- YOU KNOW RETICULATED WELL

01:41:47.701 --> 01:41:49.803
ENOUGH BUT THAT WE- WE DO THINK

01:41:49.870 --> 01:41:51.338
THAT MANY OF THESE PROPOSALS

01:41:51.405 --> 01:41:55.175
HAVE MERIT. MANY OF THEM HAVE-

01:41:55.242 --> 01:41:56.944
PROBABLY AN ALIGNMENT WITH THE

01:41:57.010 --> 01:41:59.046
GOALS OF THE LEGISLATURE IS

01:41:59.112 --> 01:42:00.981
EXPRESSED PREVIOUSLY AND EVEN.

01:42:01.048 --> 01:42:02.850
THE NEEDS OF CALIFORNIA AND

01:42:02.916 --> 01:42:04.852
THAT DID CALIFORNIANS AS WE SEE

01:42:04.918 --> 01:42:08.388
IT TOO. I THINK WHAT. I WAS

01:42:08.455 --> 01:42:10.757
JUST RACINE IS THAT. THERE IS

01:42:10.824 --> 01:42:12.392
KIND OF A WIDE RANGE OF

01:42:12.459 --> 01:42:14.862
PROPOSALS MANY OF THEM I THINK

01:42:14.928 --> 01:42:16.163
WE'RE STILL AWAITING SOME OF

01:42:16.230 --> 01:42:17.698
THE DETAILS ABOUT HOW THEY

01:42:17.764 --> 01:42:19.833
WOULD BE IMPLEMENTED AND SO

01:42:19.900 --> 01:42:22.002
WE'RE JUST RAISING THE QUESTION

01:42:22.069 --> 01:42:23.704
OR THAT THE POINT TO KEEP IN

01:42:23.770 --> 01:42:26.406
MIND THAT WOULD USE THEM LOOK

01:42:26.473 --> 01:42:27.941
AT THE ESTIMATES BEFORE YOU

01:42:28.008 --> 01:42:29.009
THEY DON'T TAKE ANY OF THAT

01:42:29.076 --> 01:42:30.644
INTO ACCOUNT YET. AND TO THE

01:42:30.711 --> 01:42:32.546
EXTENT WE HAVE THE DATA THAT

01:42:32.613 --> 01:42:33.847
COULD SUPPORT IT SOME OF THE

01:42:33.914 --> 01:42:36.416
TYPES OF NEAR TERM SPENDING

01:42:36.483 --> 01:42:38.452
THAT GENERATE LONG TERM SAVINGS

01:42:38.519 --> 01:42:42.389
SOME OF THOSE ARE VERY HARD TO.

01:42:42.456 --> 01:42:47.194
IT IS YOU KNOW VALIDATE- IN IN

01:42:47.261 --> 01:42:49.363
DATA BUT BUT TO THE EXTENT WE

01:42:49.429 --> 01:42:51.565
HAVE ACCESS TO THAT WE WILL BE

01:42:51.632 --> 01:42:55.636
HAPPY TO TRADE INCORPORATED SO.

01:42:55.702 --> 01:42:58.605
THANK YOU SENATOR PAN. I THANK

01:42:58.672 --> 01:43:00.040

FOR BEING HERE. I THINK. SPREAD

01:43:06.747 --> 01:43:08.282
ECCA I THINK YOU'RE STAFF IF

01:43:08.348 --> 01:43:09.383
THEY HAVE BEEN RE TOLD YOU KNOW

01:43:09.449 --> 01:43:11.418
THAT I ASKED THIS VERY QUESTION

01:43:11.485 --> 01:43:13.720
ALL THE TIME LIKE OKAY WHAT

01:43:13.787 --> 01:43:14.721
HAPPENS IF WE MAKE THE

01:43:14.788 --> 01:43:16.790
INVESTMENT WHAT'S THE OUT YEARS

01:43:16.857 --> 01:43:18.191
WHAT HAPPENS WE DON'T MAKE THE

01:43:18.258 --> 01:43:21.061
INVESTMENT THE OUT YEAR AND- I

01:43:21.128 --> 01:43:22.362
AGREE WITH YOU CAN BE DIFFICULT

01:43:22.429 --> 01:43:23.096
TO SOMEONE WHO DOES HEALTH

01:43:23.163 --> 01:43:24.965
SERVICES RESEARCH BY SAID EVEN

01:43:25.032 --> 01:43:26.533
THAT'S BUT EVEN HOLDING A VERY

01:43:26.600 --> 01:43:27.534
HIGH STANDARD FOR THE QUALITY

01:43:27.601 --> 01:43:30.003
OF DATA RIGHT AND SAY- THERE

01:43:30.070 --> 01:43:31.972
ARE OPPORTUNITIES TO MAKE

01:43:32.039 --> 01:43:33.073
SAVINGS THROUGH INVESTMENT SO

01:43:33.140 --> 01:43:35.976
WE THINK ABOUT- HOW DO WE

01:43:36.043 --> 01:43:37.311
PREPARE FOR THE NEXT ECONOMIC

01:43:37.377 --> 01:43:39.012
DOWNTURN CERTAINLY AND I'VE

01:43:39.079 --> 01:43:40.347
BEEN VERY SUPPORTIVE OF IN A

01:43:40.414 --> 01:43:41.248
MANY OF US. AND WE HAVE A RAINY

01:43:41.315 --> 01:43:43.216
DAY FUND SO FORTH BUT ALSO THIS

01:43:43.283 --> 01:43:44.851
IS THE TIME YOU WANT TO INVEST

01:43:44.918 --> 01:43:46.453
IN MAKING THE KIND OF CHANGES

01:43:46.520 --> 01:43:46.954
THAT THAT LEAD TO LOWER

01:43:47.020 --> 01:43:48.689
EXPENDITURES LATER ON THAT'S

01:43:48.755 --> 01:43:51.725
ANOTHER WAY OF TRYING TO-

01:43:51.792 --> 01:43:54.795
PREPARE FOR DOWNTURN AS WELL-

01:43:54.861 --> 01:43:55.762
NOW WE'RE GONNA HAVE SEVERAL

01:43:55.829 --> 01:43:56.830
BUDGET COMMITTEE HEARINGS ON

01:43:56.897 --> 01:43:58.231
VERY SPECIFIC TOPICS LIKE

01:43:58.298 --> 01:44:00.267
HOMELESS SO FORTH SO I WHY WHY

01:44:00.334 --> 01:44:01.835
FOCUS MY COMMENTS AND ACTUALLY

01:44:01.902 --> 01:44:04.037
QUESTIONS ON- HERE TODAY IS

01:44:04.104 --> 01:44:05.339
REALLY SORT OF THE OUT YEARS

01:44:05.405 --> 01:44:07.574
pBUDGET PROCESS WERE MAINLY

01:44:07.641 --> 01:44:09.409
LOOKING AT. THE PROPOSED BUDGET

01:44:09.476 --> 01:44:12.079
FOR THIS COMING YEAR BUT- YOU

01:44:12.145 --> 01:44:14.281
KNOW ALSO COVERING BEHIND THAT

01:44:14.348 --> 01:44:15.549
IS THE OUT YEARS AND SOMETIMES

01:44:15.616 --> 01:44:17.384
IT USES AN ARGUMENT FOR AGAINST

01:44:17.451 --> 01:44:19.219
A PARTICULAR BUDGET PROPOSAL

01:44:19.286 --> 01:44:22.055
SO- I THINK- AGAIN I KNOW THAT

01:44:22.122 --> 01:44:23.991
MY GOOD FRIEND- CENTER SKINNER

01:44:24.057 --> 01:44:25.626
I MENTIONED THE HOMELESSNESS I

01:44:25.692 --> 01:44:26.860
APPRECIATE THE GOVERNOR PUTTING

01:44:26.927 --> 01:44:28.395
THAT INVESTMENT LOOKING FORWARD

01:44:28.462 --> 01:44:29.329
TO HEARING THE DETAILS WE'LL

01:44:29.396 --> 01:44:31.164
TALK ABOUT BUT THAT MORE HERE-

01:44:31.231 --> 01:44:35.736
FUTURE COMMITTEE HEARING BUT.

01:44:35.802 --> 01:44:36.336
THE IDEA THAT IT'S GONNA BE A

01:44:36.403 --> 01:44:39.773
ONE YEAR. I THINK IS THAT AND

01:44:39.840 --> 01:44:40.707
SAYING THAT AS PROJECT A BUDGET

01:44:40.774 --> 01:44:41.642
OUT YOU. THAT WOULD GO DO THIS

01:44:41.708 --> 01:44:44.177
IS A ONE YEAR THING IS. I'M NOT

01:44:44.244 --> 01:44:45.012
SURE THAT'S A REALLY A

01:44:45.078 --> 01:44:46.880
REALISTIC ASSUMPTION RIGHT IF

01:44:46.947 --> 01:44:47.514
WE ACTUALLY GO OUT TO COMMUTING

01:44:47.581 --> 01:44:50.517
SAID. HERE'S ONE YEAR FUNDING.

01:44:50.584 --> 01:44:51.852
AND THERE'S NO COMMITMENT TO

01:44:51.918 --> 01:44:53.120
FURTHER YEARS I DON'T THINK

01:44:53.186 --> 01:44:54.054
WE'RE GONNA BE EFFECTIVELY EVEN

01:44:54.121 --> 01:44:57.457
USE THE MONEY. NOT TO SAY- IS

01:44:57.524 --> 01:44:59.226
THAT TRULY REALISTIC PROJECTION

01:44:59.292 --> 01:45:02.329
ON HOW WE AND SPEND DRAPED. SO

01:45:02.396 --> 01:45:04.931
AS WE LOOK AT THAT. I KNOW

01:45:04.998 --> 01:45:06.433
THAT. IN THE PROPOSAL THERE'S

01:45:06.500 --> 01:45:08.402
OFFICIALLY EIGHTEEN MONTH.

01:45:08.468 --> 01:45:09.736
EXTENSION OF THESE AUTOMATIC

01:45:09.803 --> 01:45:13.907
SUSPENSIONS. YOU KNOW I EIGHT I

01:45:13.974 --> 01:45:16.943
JUST THINK THAT SURE WE CAN I

01:45:17.010 --> 01:45:18.412
MEAN AND WE DID VOTE FOR- ON

01:45:18.478 --> 01:45:19.780
EXPENSES LAST YEAR THAT'S

01:45:19.846 --> 01:45:21.048
SOMETHING THE GOVERNOR PUSHED

01:45:21.114 --> 01:45:22.983
FOR AND WE EXCEEDED BUT I'D

01:45:23.050 --> 01:45:24.451
REALLY YOU KNOW WHAT YOU THINK

01:45:24.518 --> 01:45:25.952
ABOUT WHAT THE IMPACT OF THAT

01:45:26.019 --> 01:45:28.121
AUTOMATIC SUSPENSION BE IF WE

01:45:28.188 --> 01:45:30.123
TRULY CARRY IT OUT. IS IT

01:45:30.190 --> 01:45:31.625
SOMETHING WE REALLY WANT TO BE

01:45:31.692 --> 01:45:33.660
TELLING PEOPLE THAT. YOU KNOW I

01:45:33.727 --> 01:45:35.128
MEAN LOOKS GREAT ON THE GRAPH

01:45:35.195 --> 01:45:35.762
AND WE HAVE THIS LITTLE POP UP

01:45:35.829 --> 01:45:38.799
HERE AND TWENTY THREE YOU KNOW.

01:45:38.865 --> 01:45:39.332
TWENTY TWENTY THREE TWENTY

01:45:39.399 --> 01:45:41.134
FOUR. BUT I DON'T THINK WE'RE

01:45:41.201 --> 01:45:45.138
BEING. ENTIRELY FORTHRIGHT WITH

01:45:45.205 --> 01:45:47.140
PEOPLE INCLUDING OURSELVES IF

01:45:47.207 --> 01:45:49.476
WE THINK THAT'S REALLY HOW WE

01:45:49.543 --> 01:45:52.813
WANT TO DO THINGS RIGHT. SO AND

01:45:52.879 --> 01:45:53.780
OF COURSE MOST OF OUR FOCUS

01:45:53.847 --> 01:45:54.948
ACTION HEALTH AND HUMAN

01:45:55.015 --> 01:45:58.051
SERVICES- AGAIN SO IS THAT WHAT

01:45:58.118 --> 01:46:00.087
WE REALLY WANT TO TELL PEOPLE-

01:46:00.153 --> 01:46:01.254
INCLUDING PEOPLE WHO HAVE

01:46:01.321 --> 01:46:02.756
DISABILITIES PEOPLE WHO NEED

01:46:02.823 --> 01:46:04.491
SOCIAL SERVICES THAT OH BY THE

01:46:04.558 --> 01:46:06.960
WAY AND- TWENTY TWENTY THREE

01:46:07.027 --> 01:46:08.528
WERE YES THINGS AREN'T GOOD

01:46:08.595 --> 01:46:09.830
WE'RE JUST GONNA AUTOMATICALLY

01:46:09.896 --> 01:46:11.565
WITHOUT ANY ACTIVE ACTOR

01:46:11.631 --> 01:46:13.600

KNOW. AND WE NEED TO HAVE A

01:50:17.644 --> 01:50:18.979
DISCUSSION ABOUT THAT IN THE

01:50:19.045 --> 01:50:20.613
WAIVERS ARE COMING UP AND WHAT

01:50:20.680 --> 01:50:22.415
WE DO KNOW IS THAT RIGHT NOW.

01:50:22.482 --> 01:50:24.050
FEDERAL YELL CENTERS FOR

01:50:24.117 --> 01:50:25.452

SIZE- SO. AGAIN THAT'S ANOTHER

01:50:36.963 --> 01:50:38.732
RISK AND WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT

01:50:38.798 --> 01:50:40.700
HOW WE'RE GOING TO HANDLE THAT

01:50:40.767 --> 01:50:41.801
ASIDE FROM THE ALSO PUSHING

01:50:41.868 --> 01:50:43.670
BACK ON THAT. SO JUST ONE OF

01:50:43.737 --> 01:50:44.571
YOU KNOW IF THAT'S GOING TO BE

01:50:44.637 --> 01:50:46.840
PART DISCUSSION AGAIN THINKING

01:50:46.906 --> 01:50:47.474
ABOUT WHAT KIND OF RISK WE HAVE

01:50:47.540 --> 01:50:54.280
TO DEAL WITH- THEN FOR. FIVE

01:50:54.347 --> 01:50:56.282
SELL AND FIND I GUESS ONE OF

01:50:56.349 --> 01:50:57.450
SECOND WHAT- MY GOOD FRIEND

01:50:57.517 --> 01:50:58.718
THAT CENTER SKINNER MENTIONED

01:50:58.785 --> 01:51:00.754

01:51:00.820 --> 01:51:03.089
US ARE LIKE HOUSE KEY- YEAH WE

01:51:03.156 --> 01:51:05.091
HAVE- FUNDS FOR ACTUALLY

01:51:05.158 --> 01:51:06.493
INTERESTING ENOUGH WE TALK A

01:51:06.559 --> 01:51:08.395
AIR POLLUTION- WHAT'S THE

01:51:08.461 --> 01:51:10.530
RESULT- IF CUTTING BACK MONEY

01:51:10.597 --> 01:51:11.431
FOR AIR POLLUTION BECAUSE WE

01:51:11.498 --> 01:51:13.199
HAVE LESS MY AGE YEAR ACCESS MY

01:51:13.266 --> 01:51:14.467
GUESS IS THAT WE'RE GONNA SEE A

01:51:14.534 --> 01:51:15.602
LOT OF KIDS ON THAT ACCOUNT HE

01:51:15.668 --> 01:51:17.170
MORE ASTHMA TREATMENTS AND

01:51:17.237 --> 01:51:18.538
OTHER TYPES OF THINGS SO YOU

01:51:18.605 --> 01:51:19.439
KNOW THIS IS BLOOM TO GET

01:51:19.506 --> 01:51:20.640
SQUISHED HERE GETS OVER HERE

01:51:20.707 --> 01:51:22.342
SO. I'M HOPING WE CAN THINK

01:51:22.409 --> 01:51:24.611
ABOUT SOME REFORMS TO HOW WE'RE

01:51:24.677 --> 01:51:26.079

01:51:26.146 --> 01:51:28.314
FORTH IN A WAY THAT- BOTH GETS

01:51:28.381 --> 01:51:30.216
US OR CARBON GOALS I THINK

01:51:30.283 --> 01:51:31.351
THAT'S THE MAIN PURPOSE AND

01:51:31.418 --> 01:51:32.419
THAT SHOULD BE THE MAIN PURPOSE

01:51:32.485 --> 01:51:34.354
BUT MY GUESS IS THAT IF WE'RE

01:51:34.421 --> 01:51:35.822
GOING TO GET THAT CURVE WOULD

01:51:35.889 --> 01:51:37.624
PROBABLY MIGHT BRING IN LEX OR

01:51:37.690 --> 01:51:38.825
REVENUE TO SO WE CAN SUSTAIN

01:51:38.892 --> 01:51:40.927
OUR INVESTMENTS AND- THEIR

01:51:40.994 --> 01:51:43.930
POLLUTION AND THEN FINALLY- WE

01:51:43.997 --> 01:51:45.198
TALKED ABOUT OTHER TYPES OF

01:51:45.265 --> 01:51:46.733
RISKS THE ALLOWED TO DEAL WITH

01:51:46.800 --> 01:51:49.269
WILDFIRES- SO IMAGINE FLOODS

01:51:49.335 --> 01:51:50.303
SACRAMENTO IS WHAT ABOUT

01:51:50.370 --> 01:51:52.272
FLOODS- AND THEN I HAVE TO SAY

01:51:52.338 --> 01:51:53.540
IS A PUBLIC HEALTH PERSON IS

01:51:53.606 --> 01:51:54.474
THAT WE HAVE PUBLIC HEALTH

01:51:54.541 --> 01:51:56.109
RISKS RIGHT SO ACTUALLY EVEN

01:51:56.176 --> 01:51:57.343
TYPE THAT HOMELESSNESS AND I'D

01:51:57.410 --> 01:51:59.212
BE CURIOUS- WE CAN. GET INTO

01:51:59.279 --> 01:52:03.349
MORE DETAILS. IN A- FUTURE

01:52:03.416 --> 01:52:06.619
HEARING. SO YOU KNOW WE HAD TO

01:52:06.686 --> 01:52:07.987
HAVE THE- A. L. BECAUSE OF

01:52:08.054 --> 01:52:10.256
HOMELESS RIGHT WE HAD. IN IN.

01:52:10.323 --> 01:52:12.826
BUT SAN. RIGHT SO. WHAT INVEST

01:52:12.892 --> 01:52:13.393
ARE WE MAKING ON THE POP.

01:52:13.460 --> 01:52:15.061
HEALTH SO IN PREPARATION FOR

01:52:15.128 --> 01:52:16.296
THESE TYPES BECAUSE THEY'RE

01:52:16.362 --> 01:52:17.697
THEY'RE EXPENSIVE. IN THE END

01:52:17.764 --> 01:52:18.898
RIGHT SAN DIEGO SPENT A LOT OF

01:52:18.965 --> 01:52:20.033
MONEY TRYING TO. DEAL WITH

01:52:20.100 --> 01:52:22.902

01:52:29.542 --> 01:52:30.677
BULLET SEVERAL YEARS AGO AND

01:52:30.743 --> 01:52:32.045
OTHER TYPES OF THINGS SO. THE

01:52:32.112 --> 01:52:32.979
OF OUR PUBLIC HEALTH

01:52:33.046 --> 01:52:35.014
PREPAREDNESS FOR BOTH OUTBREAKS

01:52:35.081 --> 01:52:36.816
IN OUR ONGOING ISSUES LIKE ARE.

01:52:36.883 --> 01:52:38.718
VERY HIGH STD RATES AND SO

01:52:38.785 --> 01:52:40.753
FORTH SO. AD SO WANT TO DELVE

01:52:40.820 --> 01:52:42.555
INTO THAT BY JUST WHAT THE

01:52:42.622 --> 01:52:45.158
MARKER ON THAT AS WELL- SO

01:52:45.225 --> 01:52:47.760
THOSE ARE SOME OF THE- ISSUES-

01:52:47.827 --> 01:52:49.462
BUT MAYBE PERHAPS YOU CAN JUST

01:52:49.529 --> 01:52:52.799
COMMENT. BRIEFLY I. POINT OUT

01:52:52.866 --> 01:52:54.334
ISSUES THAT MAYBE CAN CALM

01:52:54.400 --> 01:52:55.935
ABOUT HOW FINANCE AND ALSO

01:52:56.002 --> 01:52:57.237
ELLIE AS PERSPECTIVE ON HOW

01:52:57.303 --> 01:52:59.305
WE'RE FIGURING OUT. EXACTLY

01:52:59.372 --> 01:53:00.907
WATER OUT YEARS LOOKS LIKE

01:53:00.974 --> 01:53:02.342
BECAUSE CERTAINLY WE ALL

01:53:02.408 --> 01:53:04.444
TOGETHER. MUTUALLY WANT TO BE

01:53:04.511 --> 01:53:05.979
SURE THAT WE MAKE INVESTMENTS

01:53:06.045 --> 01:53:07.213
WE CAN SUSTAIN THEM THAT WE CAN

01:53:07.280 --> 01:53:08.648
ACHIEVE THE GOALS THAT WE WILL

01:53:08.715 --> 01:53:09.616
ACHIEVE THAT USUALLY REQUIRES

01:53:09.682 --> 01:53:11.251
MORE THAN. A SINGLE YEAR

01:53:11.317 --> 01:53:12.886
DEPENDING. ARE HAVING A FUND

01:53:12.952 --> 01:53:14.854
THAT WE CAN AND THEN OF COURSE

01:53:14.921 --> 01:53:16.823
BE SURE THAT WE ARE. YOU KNOW

01:53:16.890 --> 01:53:19.392
WE CAN. MITIGATE THE RISKS THAT

01:53:19.459 --> 01:53:22.562
MIGHT BE BEFORE US. YES HE- SAW

01:53:22.629 --> 01:53:24.230
ALL MAKE THREE BRIEF POINTS AND

01:53:24.297 --> 01:53:25.131
ARE YOU COVERED A LOT OF GROUND

01:53:25.198 --> 01:53:27.734
SO HI. THIS IT COVER THREE

01:53:27.800 --> 01:53:28.668
POINTS IN THAT I KNOW AND THAT

01:53:28.735 --> 01:53:29.702
YOU TO COMMITTEE HEARINGS CAN

01:53:29.769 --> 01:53:30.937
DELVE INTO ALL THESE ISSUES

01:53:31.004 --> 01:53:32.539
AND- WE HAD TO DEPART FINANCES

01:53:32.605 --> 01:53:33.306
ALSO FOLLOW UP ON ANY OF THE

01:53:33.373 --> 01:53:36.176
QUESTIONS. I THINK FIRST- MOST

01:53:36.242 --> 01:53:38.044
IMPORTANT ON THE SUSPENSIONS-

01:53:38.111 --> 01:53:39.479
CERTAINLY THE ADMINISTRATION IS

01:53:39.546 --> 01:53:40.947
VERY CLEAR THAT THOSE WOULD BE

01:53:41.014 --> 01:53:42.248
DIFFICULT TO ABSORB THERE'LL BE

01:53:42.315 --> 01:53:43.983
PAINFUL FOR MANY MANY PEOPLE.

01:53:44.050 --> 01:53:44.884
AND IT'S CERTAINLY NOT

01:53:44.951 --> 01:53:46.352
SOMETHING THAT WE WANT TO DO

01:53:46.419 --> 01:53:48.054
AND SO. YOU KNOW WE WERE

01:53:48.121 --> 01:53:48.688
PLEASED THAT WITH THE

01:53:48.755 --> 01:53:49.656
PROJECTIONS COMING IN THIS YEAR

01:53:49.722 --> 01:53:51.224
WE CAN DELAY THEM BY EIGHTEEN

01:53:51.291 --> 01:53:52.559
MONTHS BUT THE REASON THAT. WE

01:53:52.625 --> 01:53:53.993
PROPOSED BUILDING THAT MAN AND

01:53:54.060 --> 01:53:55.261
THEY WERE BUILT INTO THE

01:53:55.328 --> 01:53:56.863
ENACTED BUDGET- IS SIMPLY

01:53:56.930 --> 01:53:58.998
BECAUSE- AND WE- THIS CONTINUES

01:53:59.065 --> 01:54:00.133
TO BE THE CASE WHEN WE LOOK AT

01:54:00.200 --> 01:54:04.571
OUR YEAR OVER YEAR. PROJECTIONS

01:54:04.637 --> 01:54:08.107
THE RATE OF GROWTH. AND

01:54:08.174 --> 01:54:08.908
REVENUES IS LOWER EACH YEAR

01:54:08.975 --> 01:54:10.310
THAN PRECEDING. SO INTO ONE TO

01:54:10.376 --> 01:54:11.578
TWO THEN THE BUDGET YEAR. LOWER

01:54:11.644 --> 01:54:12.378
TWENTY TWO TO THREE THAT'S TWO

01:54:12.445 --> 01:54:13.279
AND TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO AND

01:54:13.346 --> 01:54:14.480
LOWER THE YAR AFTER THAT. AND

01:54:14.547 --> 01:54:15.448
SO. I THINK THE FOR POINT IS

01:54:15.515 --> 01:54:16.049
THAT. WE DON'T WANT TO MAY. AT

01:54:16.115 --> 01:54:17.750
THE SUSPENSIONS YOU KNOW WE'D

01:54:17.817 --> 01:54:18.918
LIKE TO COMMUTER PUSHING THEM

01:54:18.985 --> 01:54:20.820
OUT OR IS. THE PICTURE CHANGES

01:54:20.887 --> 01:54:22.322
OR THE REVENUE SYSTEM CHANGES

01:54:22.388 --> 01:54:23.256
IN SOME WAY AT SOME POINT IN

01:54:23.323 --> 01:54:24.624
THE FUTURE. THAT WE COULD DO

01:54:24.691 --> 01:54:26.125
AWAY WITH THAT MANY OF CONTINUE

01:54:26.192 --> 01:54:27.126
THOSE PROGRAMS ON THE PATH

01:54:27.193 --> 01:54:28.161
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT WE LIKE TO

01:54:28.228 --> 01:54:30.029
DO AS WELL. IT'S SIMPLY PLACING

01:54:30.096 --> 01:54:31.664
A MARKER- SHOULD OUR REVENUE

01:54:31.731 --> 01:54:32.899
PROJECTIONS AS THEY ARE RIGHT

01:54:32.966 --> 01:54:34.500
NOW COME TRUE. THEN WE ARE

01:54:34.567 --> 01:54:36.302
GOING TO BE IN A LITTLE BIT OF

01:54:36.369 --> 01:54:36.936
A CRUNCH AND THEN OF COURSE AT

01:54:37.003 --> 01:54:39.138
THAT TIME. THE ADMINISTRATION

01:54:39.205 --> 01:54:40.440
AND THE LEGISLATURE CAN WORK

01:54:40.506 --> 01:54:41.908
THROUGH YOU KNOW WHICH OF THOSE

01:54:41.975 --> 01:54:43.543
PROGRAMS SUSPEND MAYBE THEIR

01:54:43.610 --> 01:54:44.844
PROGRAMS IN A TOTALLY DIFFERENT

01:54:44.911 --> 01:54:46.412
CATEGORIES THIS ASSEMBLY OUR

01:54:46.479 --> 01:54:47.880
CURRENT. SPENDING PLAN THAT

01:54:47.947 --> 01:54:48.715
WE'RE BUILDING INTO A MULTI

01:54:48.781 --> 01:54:50.550
YEAR. BUDGET AND THAT LEADS TO

01:54:50.617 --> 01:54:52.018
THE SECOND POINT WHICH IS THAT

01:54:52.085 --> 01:54:52.986
I THINK YOU KNOW EVEN THIS MAY

01:54:53.052 --> 01:54:54.587
BUT CERTAINLY. IN THE TIME

01:54:54.654 --> 01:54:57.156
BETWEEN NOW AND TWENTY TWENTY

01:54:57.223 --> 01:54:57.924
THREE RIGHT THAT'S- MORE THAN

01:54:57.991 --> 01:54:58.925
THREE YEARS AWAY. WILL HAVE

01:54:58.992 --> 01:55:00.326
ADDITIONAL CLARITY BOTH IN

01:55:00.393 --> 01:55:01.628
TERMS OF OUR REVENUE

01:55:01.694 --> 01:55:02.695
PROJECTIONS AND ECONOMIC

01:55:02.762 --> 01:55:04.564
PERFORMANCE. BUT ALSO TO THE

01:55:04.631 --> 01:55:05.732
POINT YOU RAISED ABOUT ANY

01:55:05.798 --> 01:55:07.634
FEDERAL CHANGES WITH MEDICAID-

01:55:07.700 --> 01:55:09.402
FISCAL ACCOUNTABILITY ROLE.

01:55:09.469 --> 01:55:10.436
THERE'S OF COURSE ELECTION

01:55:10.503 --> 01:55:11.504
COMING UP THIS FALL AND THERE

01:55:11.571 --> 01:55:12.472
MIGHT BE CHANGES IN THE

01:55:12.538 --> 01:55:13.539
CONGRESS AND OR THE WHITE

01:55:13.606 --> 01:55:15.208
HOUSE. AND SHOULD GIVE US SOME

01:55:15.275 --> 01:55:16.376
ADDITIONAL CLARITY IN TERMS OF

01:55:16.442 --> 01:55:17.243
WHAT TYPES OF FEDERAL

01:55:17.310 --> 01:55:18.678
REIMBURSEMENTS. WE WOULD BE

01:55:18.745 --> 01:55:20.079
EXPECTING AND THAT'S MAINLY ON

01:55:20.146 --> 01:55:21.748
THE HEALTHCARE SIDE. BUT ALSO

01:55:21.814 --> 01:55:22.749
ON THINGS WITH A YOU KNOW

01:55:22.815 --> 01:55:23.916
FEDERAL WILD FIRES AND WE'VE

01:55:23.983 --> 01:55:25.451
BEEN FORTUNATE SO FAR THAT THE

01:55:25.518 --> 01:55:27.086
ASK. FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS-

01:55:27.153 --> 01:55:29.122
RESPONDED TO OUR REQUESTS- BUT

01:55:29.188 --> 01:55:30.089
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'LL BE

01:55:30.156 --> 01:55:31.457
KEEPING AN EYE ON BECAUSE THE

01:55:31.524 --> 01:55:32.392
RAPPER THAT MONEY COMING IT IS

01:55:32.458 --> 01:55:33.660
FUNGIBLE. WHEN WE THINK ABOUT

01:55:33.726 --> 01:55:35.328
HOW MUCH MONEY THAT WE HAVE. A

01:55:35.395 --> 01:55:36.529
AND THEN THE FINAL POINT ALL

01:55:36.596 --> 01:55:37.897
NAY GOD JUST ON THREE OF THE

01:55:37.964 --> 01:55:39.198
SPECIFIC PROGRAMS THAT YOU

01:55:39.265 --> 01:55:40.500
MENTIONED I KNOW THERE WILL BE

01:55:40.566 --> 01:55:41.701
TIME TO GO INTO. SOME OF THE

01:55:41.768 --> 01:55:43.703
OTHERS- BUT FOR EARLY LEARNING

01:55:43.770 --> 01:55:44.804
AND CARE YOU MENTIONED EIGHT

01:55:44.871 --> 01:55:45.838
POINT ONE MILLION DOLLARS

01:55:45.905 --> 01:55:47.640
CERTAINLY IT'S THAT. GOVERNOR'S

01:55:47.707 --> 01:55:49.242
HOPE THAT WE CAN INVEST MORE IN

01:55:49.309 --> 01:55:50.810
THERE THAT'S PART THE REASON

01:55:50.877 --> 01:55:52.011
YOU WANT TO PUT TOGETHER THIS

01:55:52.078 --> 01:55:53.346
OVERALL MASTER PLAN AND I

01:55:53.413 --> 01:55:55.081
BELIEVE THAT THAT MASTER PLAN.

01:55:55.148 --> 01:55:56.382
SHOULD BE BEING RELEASED IN

01:55:56.449 --> 01:55:58.284
OCTOBER OF THIS YEAR. IF I

01:55:58.351 --> 01:55:59.919
RECALL CORRECTLY AND SHOULD

01:55:59.986 --> 01:56:01.287
INCLUDE IN ADDITION TO ALL THE

01:56:01.354 --> 01:56:05.024
DIFFERENT AREAS. SOME. SENSE OF

01:56:05.091 --> 01:56:08.494
HOW. AVENUES WILL BE GENERATED

01:56:08.561 --> 01:56:09.829
INVEST SOME EASIER. THAT

01:56:09.896 --> 01:56:10.897
DOESN'T MEAN. THAT THEY- BE. OR

01:56:10.963 --> 01:56:11.464
BY THE LEGISLATURE BUT WE'RE

01:56:11.531 --> 01:56:12.565
H THERE THAT WE GET IS. OF

01:56:12.632 --> 01:56:13.599
HOW CAN WE ASK. PUT IN. MONEY

01:56:13.666 --> 01:56:14.600
BEYOND THE IN. TO WE'VE CURRENT.

01:56:14.667 --> 01:56:16.769
MADE WHEN IT COMES TO H. THAT

01:56:16.836 --> 01:56:17.570
IS MORE OF A CASELOAD

01:56:17.637 --> 01:56:19.172
ENTITLEMENT ISSUES SO THAT.

01:56:19.238 --> 01:56:20.740
MAKE GROWING THE NATURAL OF

01:56:20.807 --> 01:56:21.941
COURSE OF THE ECONOMY TURNS AS

01:56:22.008 --> 01:56:23.109
YOU KNOW. THINGS MAY BE

01:56:23.176 --> 01:56:24.844
DIFFERENT BUT- THAT GROWTH THAT

01:56:24.911 --> 01:56:25.845
WE CONTINUE TO BUILDINGS ARE

01:56:25.912 --> 01:56:27.914
MULTI YEAR PROJECTION- AND THEN

01:56:27.980 --> 01:56:29.782
FINALLY ON HOMELESSNESS- VERY

01:56:29.849 --> 01:56:31.150
COGNIZANT OF YOUR POINT THAT

01:56:31.217 --> 01:56:32.852
THIS CAN'T BE SOLVED. IN ONE

01:56:32.919 --> 01:56:34.387
YEAR AND SO ONE YEAR OF

01:56:34.454 --> 01:56:35.822
FINDING. IS NOT GOING TO SOLVE

01:56:35.888 --> 01:56:37.690
THE PROBLEM.I THINK OF WHAT

01:56:37.757 --> 01:56:38.858
WE'RE SEEING BETWEEN WHAT WE

01:56:38.925 --> 01:56:40.360
HAVE IN OUR BUDGET- WHAT THE

01:56:40.426 --> 01:56:41.327
GOVERNOR WORKING WITH

01:56:41.394 --> 01:56:42.862
LEGISLATURE'S. IS OUT ON HIS

01:56:42.929 --> 01:56:43.963
TOWARD THIS YEAR AND THEN THE

01:56:44.030 --> 01:56:45.365
RECOMMENDATIONS AB MAYOR

01:56:45.431 --> 01:56:46.733
STEINBERG AND- SUPERVISOR

01:56:46.799 --> 01:56:48.568
RIDLEY THOMAS. IS THAT THERE IS

01:56:48.634 --> 01:56:51.037
A LOT FLOWING IN THE SPACE- IN

01:56:51.104 --> 01:56:52.138
TERMS OF NEW PROPOSAL SOME OF

01:56:52.205 --> 01:56:54.040
WHICH WE PROPOSED ON OUR OWN.

01:56:54.107 --> 01:56:54.907
SO I THINK IN THE NEXT COUPLE

01:56:54.974 --> 01:56:55.808
MONTHS WORKING WITH THE

01:56:55.875 --> 01:56:57.377
LEGISLATURE WE'RE GONNA TRY TO

01:56:57.443 --> 01:56:58.344
COME TOGETHER ON A STRATEGY

01:56:58.411 --> 01:57:00.146
FOR. HOW TO ATTACK THIS BOTH IN

01:57:00.213 --> 01:57:03.316
THE BUDGET BUT ALSO TAKING OVER

01:57:03.383 --> 01:57:06.586
THE LONG TERM. A YES SO. THANK

01:57:06.652 --> 01:57:08.221
YOU SENATOR PAN I THINK YOU YOU

01:57:08.287 --> 01:57:10.656
MADE A LOT OF- GOOD

01:57:10.723 --> 01:57:14.827
OBSERVATIONS- FOR US- BUT- AS

01:57:14.894 --> 01:57:16.963
FOR THE L. YEAR. I THINK IT IS

01:57:17.029 --> 01:57:18.698
PRUDENT TO PLAN FOR AN

01:57:18.765 --> 01:57:20.566
OPERATING SURPLUS PARTICULARLY

01:57:20.633 --> 01:57:21.834
IN A TIME WHEN REVENUE GROWTH

01:57:21.901 --> 01:57:24.670
IS SLOWING. AND WE THINK THAT

01:57:24.737 --> 01:57:25.638
THERE COULD BE SOME RISKS TO

01:57:25.705 --> 01:57:27.006
THE- TO THE OUTLOOK AND

01:57:27.073 --> 01:57:28.841
CERTAINLY THE- GOVERNOR'S PLAN

01:57:28.908 --> 01:57:30.576
DOES SHOW THAT THERE WOULD BE-

01:57:30.643 --> 01:57:32.845
AN OPERATING SURPLUS. ON PAPER.

01:57:32.912 --> 01:57:35.815
BUT YOU KNOW AS YOU POINTED OUT

01:57:35.882 --> 01:57:37.884
THAT IF THE SUSPENSIONS- DID

01:57:37.950 --> 01:57:40.386
NOT TAKE EFFECT. THEN THE

01:57:40.453 --> 01:57:43.022
LARGER SURPLUS IN TWENTY THREE

01:57:43.089 --> 01:57:43.823
TWENTY FOUR WOULD ACTUALLY BE

01:57:43.890 --> 01:57:45.792
MORE. LIKE A TWO BILLION DOLLAR

01:57:45.858 --> 01:57:49.362
DEFICIT. AND SO. ARE WE JUST

01:57:49.429 --> 01:57:51.297
THINK THAT IT MIGHT BE. BETTER

01:57:51.364 --> 01:57:54.066
IF THE LEGISLATURE CARES ABOUT

01:57:54.133 --> 01:57:55.368
THE COMMITMENTS THAT ARE

01:57:55.435 --> 01:57:57.270
REFLECTED IN THE SUSPENSION

01:57:57.336 --> 01:58:00.106
PROGRAMS THAT. TO RECOGNIZE THE

01:58:00.173 --> 01:58:02.375
FULL COST OF THEM UP FRONT AND

01:58:02.442 --> 01:58:04.343
THEN DECIDE ON THE MERITS OF

01:58:04.410 --> 01:58:05.511
THOSE OF THOSE COMMITMENTS

01:58:05.578 --> 01:58:07.079
ABOUT YOU KNOW WHETHER OR NOT

01:58:07.146 --> 01:58:07.814
IT WANTS TO FUND THOSE ARE

01:58:07.880 --> 01:58:10.082
OTHER PRIORITIES- KIND OF FROM

01:58:10.149 --> 01:58:11.317
A CLEAR I PERSPECTIVE ABOUT

01:58:11.384 --> 01:58:13.252
WHAT IT IMPLIES FOR THIS THE

01:58:24.397 --> 01:58:25.765
OTHERS UNCERTAINTIES OTHER

01:58:25.832 --> 01:58:26.632
RISKS THAT WE HAVE TO DEAL

01:58:26.699 --> 01:58:28.301
WITH. SOME OF THE TECHNIQUES

01:58:28.367 --> 01:58:30.102
THAT WERE USING BASICALLY YEARS

01:58:30.169 --> 01:58:32.171
PUSHING THAT UNCERTAINTY ON TO

LOOK- THINGS LIKE ARE THESE

02:01:05.024 --> 02:01:06.993

SHARPEN THE PENCIL NOW ON SOME

02:01:20.039 --> 02:01:22.508
OF THOSE PROGRAMS RATHER THAN

02:01:22.575 --> 02:01:24.477
TRY TO DEAL WITH THOSE KINDS OF

02:01:24.543 --> 02:01:26.278
PROBLEMS WHEN THE BUDGET CRISIS

02:01:26.345 --> 02:01:28.180

CALTRANS SAID TO HAVE A HUNDRED

02:01:54.106 --> 02:01:55.841
MILLION DOLLARS OF EFFICIENCY

02:01:55.908 --> 02:01:57.543
IN A REPORT EVERY YEAR OR SO

02:01:57.610 --> 02:01:59.245
IT'S KILLER BUT NOW THEY'RE UP

02:02:01.480 --> 02:02:03.883
THREE MILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF

02:02:03.949 --> 02:02:06.352
FISH AND SEES THAT WE FORCED ON

02:02:06.419 --> 02:02:08.487
THEM THROUGH A STATUTE THAT WE

02:02:08.554 --> 02:02:09.889
PUT IN A STATUTE THAT WE'VE

02:02:09.955 --> 02:02:13.693
FORCED ON THEM. AND THEY HAVE.

02:02:13.759 --> 02:02:15.661
COME UP WITH THAT. NOW OVER

02:02:15.728 --> 02:02:19.331
OVER A TEN YEAR PERIOD THE

02:02:19.398 --> 02:02:20.566
LEVEL OF MONEY WE'RE GOING TO

02:02:20.633 --> 02:02:22.101
SAVE IS IN THE BILLIONS OF

02:02:22.168 --> 02:02:23.803
DOLLARS AND WE'LL HAVE THAT

02:02:23.869 --> 02:02:26.906
MONEY REINVESTED IN PROJECTS.

02:02:26.972 --> 02:02:30.109
OF THAT WE CAN BUT WHAT WE WANT

02:02:30.176 --> 02:02:33.379
OTHERWISE BE ABLE TO FUN. SO I

02:02:33.446 --> 02:02:37.717

02:02:40.319 --> 02:02:43.389
DON'T JUST FOCUS ON THE BUDGET

02:02:43.456 --> 02:02:45.558
CHANGES THEIR PROPOSED BUT

02:02:45.624 --> 02:02:47.960
FOCUS ON THE EXISTING BUDGET TO

02:02:48.027 --> 02:02:50.362
TRY TO FIND WAYS THAT WE CAN

02:02:50.429 --> 02:02:53.399
DO. THINGS BETTER MAKE

02:02:53.466 --> 02:02:55.634
EFFICIENCY IMPROVEMENTS OF

02:02:55.701 --> 02:02:57.036
BRING UP WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO

02:02:57.103 --> 02:02:58.571

GONNA HAVE AN SP ONE MADAM

02:03:00.473 --> 02:03:01.741
MADAM SURE WE'RE GONNA HAVE AN

02:03:01.807 --> 02:03:03.609
SP ONE OVERSIGHT HEARING JUST

02:03:03.676 --> 02:03:05.111
TO GET AN UPDATE ABOUT ALL

02:03:05.177 --> 02:03:06.145
WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THIS BE

02:03:06.212 --> 02:03:07.947
ONE. AND HOW WE'RE TRYNG TO BE

02:03:08.013 --> 02:03:10.015
EFFICIENT WITH THE USE OF THE

02:03:10.082 --> 02:03:14.253
FUNDS- THE DMV- IT HAS- I

02:03:14.320 --> 02:03:16.188
NOTICE- THEY DIDN'T REALLY ASK

02:03:16.255 --> 02:03:18.023
FOR ANY MONEY CORRECT. SO I

02:03:18.090 --> 02:03:19.458
THINK- YOU KNOW LIKE LIKE

02:03:19.525 --> 02:03:20.926
CHANGING THE DAY OF THE TO BE

02:03:20.993 --> 02:03:22.828
MORE EFFECTIVE EFFICIENT THAT

02:03:22.895 --> 02:03:26.899
WAS BUILT ON NECESSITY FOR DIEM

02:03:26.966 --> 02:03:28.267
WORRIED ABOUT THEIR ABILITY TO

02:03:28.334 --> 02:03:31.470
PERFORM- THEIR FUNCTION BY THE

02:03:31.537 --> 02:03:33.172
TIME THE REAL ID DEADLINE OMES

02:03:33.239 --> 02:03:37.176
IN OCTOBER. OF THIS NEXT YEAR

02:03:37.243 --> 02:03:41.280
SO THAT'S GOING TO BE. A ISSUE

02:03:41.347 --> 02:03:43.816
I THINK ON A IN TERMS OF

02:03:43.883 --> 02:03:45.618
LOOKING AT- THE DIFFERENCE

02:03:45.684 --> 02:03:49.188
BETWEEN THE TWO ONE BILLION ONE

02:03:49.255 --> 02:03:49.722
POINT FOUR BILLION ONGOING

02:03:49.789 --> 02:03:52.825
PROGRAMS. I LOOK AT LOOKING AT

02:03:52.892 --> 02:03:55.728
THE SUFFICIENCY THING AS AN

02:03:55.795 --> 02:03:57.429
EASY WAY TO CLOSE THAT GAP

02:03:57.496 --> 02:04:01.066
BETWEEN THE TWO. OKAY SO MAYBE

02:04:01.133 --> 02:04:03.469
IF YOU WORK TOGETHER AND FOUND

02:04:03.536 --> 02:04:05.437
SOME AFFECTION SEES HERE AND

02:04:05.504 --> 02:04:08.240
THERE THAT WE COULD. THE CHIEF

02:04:08.307 --> 02:04:10.709
OF THAT WILL CLOSE THE GAP OF

02:04:10.776 --> 02:04:11.911
HOUSE I WANT TO TALK ABOUT

02:04:11.977 --> 02:04:13.445
HOUSING BECAUSE I'M I'M VERY

02:04:13.512 --> 02:04:16.081
CONCERNED ABOUT. THE FACT THAT

02:04:16.148 --> 02:04:18.317
THIS BUDGET REPRESENTS- JUST A

02:04:18.384 --> 02:04:20.252
ONE TIME MAINLY IN ALMOST ALL

02:04:20.319 --> 02:04:21.720
THE MONEY IS ONE TIME NOT ON

02:04:21.787 --> 02:04:23.856
GOING BUT WE HAVE A COMMITMENT

02:04:23.923 --> 02:04:25.191
THAT WE HAVE TO DO AN

02:04:25.257 --> 02:04:26.525
UNDERSTANDING I THINK WE WERE

02:04:26.592 --> 02:04:27.693
ETTING FROM YOU IN THE IN THE

02:04:27.760 --> 02:04:29.261
READING THE BUDGET. THAT WE

02:04:29.328 --> 02:04:31.931
HAVE TO DO AN ONGOING- HOUSING

02:04:31.997 --> 02:04:34.600
PROGRAM TO THE GEE WHAT WE WANT

02:04:34.667 --> 02:04:38.370
TO ACHIEVE AND HOUSING. AND I

02:04:38.437 --> 02:04:39.939
WOULD URGE YOU TO LOOK AT AN

02:04:40.005 --> 02:04:42.775
ONGOING SOURCE OF FINDING. A

02:04:42.842 --> 02:04:44.410
SUCH AS WE PROPOSED LAST YEAR

02:04:44.476 --> 02:04:46.612
IN THE SENATE. AND THE GOVERNOR

02:04:46.679 --> 02:04:48.547
VETOED WITH SAM ACQUIRE ANTHONY

02:04:48.614 --> 02:04:51.750
PORTANTINO ME. PROPOSING A BILL

02:04:51.817 --> 02:04:53.385
THAT ACTUALLY WORKED IN A

02:04:53.452 --> 02:04:55.654
COLLABORATION WITH THE CITIES

02:04:55.721 --> 02:04:56.956
AND COUNTIES. YOU'RE NOT GONNA

02:04:57.022 --> 02:04:58.157
SOLVE THIS UNLESS YOU HAVE A

02:04:58.224 --> 02:04:59.959
COLLABORATION WITH ALL THE

02:05:00.025 --> 02:05:01.994
CITIES AND COUNTIES. YOU'RE NOT

02:05:02.061 --> 02:05:03.128

GONNA BE ABLE TO HANDLE. THE

02:05:04.797 --> 02:05:06.498
TYPES OF PEOPLE THERE HOMELESS

02:05:06.565 --> 02:05:13.172
THE- WELL THAT IS- ALMOST

02:05:13.239 --> 02:05:15.341
BECAUSE OF ECONOMIC REASONS.

02:05:15.407 --> 02:05:16.876
BECAUSE OF THE RATE GOING UP

02:05:16.942 --> 02:05:19.912
TOO MUCH OF THE SOCIAL REASONS

02:05:19.979 --> 02:05:20.479
THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT

02:05:20.546 --> 02:05:24.149
HAVE. DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND-

02:05:24.216 --> 02:05:28.220
OTHER TRAUMA. AND AS RESULTS-

02:05:28.287 --> 02:05:30.322
HAD TO RUN AWAY FROM THAT KIND

02:05:30.389 --> 02:05:32.892
OF SITUATION. AND THEY BECAME

02:05:32.958 --> 02:05:34.660
HOMELESS SEVEN THERE'S- THERE'S

02:05:34.727 --> 02:05:39.565
DIFFERENT REASONS- THERE'S-

02:05:39.632 --> 02:05:43.202
PEOPLE THAT ARE DISABLED THERE

02:05:43.269 --> 02:05:46.038
ARE- I THINK WE'RE WE'RE VERY

02:05:46.105 --> 02:05:47.773
SCARED THAT THE PEOPLE THAT ARE

02:05:47.840 --> 02:05:50.242
DISABLED ARE LOSING THEIR GROUP

02:05:50.309 --> 02:05:51.477
HOMES THEY'RE CLOSING GROUP

02:05:51.543 --> 02:05:54.713
PROBLEMS IN CALIFORNIA I THINK

02:05:54.780 --> 02:05:55.147
THAT'S CAUSING SOME

02:05:55.214 --> 02:05:57.182
HOMELESSNESS. THAT'S KIND OF

02:05:57.249 --> 02:05:58.951
SCARY THAT SOMEBODY IT CAN'T

02:05:59.018 --> 02:06:00.819
TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES AND WE

02:06:00.886 --> 02:06:02.254
NEED TO TAKE CARE OF WE NEED TO

02:06:02.321 --> 02:06:03.522
HAVE THAT SAFETY NET FOR THOSE

02:06:03.589 --> 02:06:05.791
PEOPLE AND THEY'RE LOSING OF

02:06:05.858 --> 02:06:07.726
WE'RE WE'RE LOSING GROUP HOMES

02:06:07.793 --> 02:06:09.728
THAT THEY ARE CARED FOR IN. AND

02:06:09.795 --> 02:06:12.097
THIS INCLUDES PEOPLE- THAT HAVE

02:06:12.164 --> 02:06:15.100
DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. SO

02:06:15.167 --> 02:06:15.601
I TAKE WHEN YOU LOOK AT

02:06:15.668 --> 02:06:18.604
HOUSING. OF IT SEEMS TO ME

02:06:18.671 --> 02:06:21.707
THAT- THIS KIND OF SAFETY NET

02:06:21.774 --> 02:06:24.376
WITH THAT WE WANT TO ACHIEVE IS

02:06:24.443 --> 02:06:26.145
VERY IMPORTANT I I'M I'M VERY

02:06:26.211 --> 02:06:28.147
CONCERNED ABOUT THIS. I THINK

02:06:28.213 --> 02:06:30.215
YOU SHOULD SET GOALS AND

02:06:30.282 --> 02:06:32.284
NUMBERS OF HOW MANY PEOPLE YOU

02:06:32.351 --> 02:06:34.320
WANNA HOUSE AND WHAT YOUR GOALS

02:06:34.386 --> 02:06:36.355
ARE EACH YEAR TO ELIMINATE

02:06:36.422 --> 02:06:38.791
HOMELESSNESS. AND REALLY GET

02:06:38.857 --> 02:06:40.192
DOWN TO REFINING THAT AND

02:06:40.259 --> 02:06:43.462
pCOMING UP WITH THE DIFFERENT

02:06:43.529 --> 02:06:43.963
KINDS OF PEOPLE THAT ARE

02:06:44.029 --> 02:06:46.865
HOMELESS. I KNOW A LITTLE BIT

02:06:46.932 --> 02:06:49.168
ABOUT HOMELESS BECAUSE- ONE MY

02:06:49.234 --> 02:06:50.970
FAMILY WE HAD A FIRE OUR HOUSE

02:06:51.036 --> 02:06:52.905
BURNED DOWN AND THE TWELVE OF

02:06:52.972 --> 02:06:55.274
US BECAME HOMELESS SO I HAD

02:06:55.341 --> 02:06:56.976
EXPERIENCE YOU KNOW IT IT AND

02:06:57.042 --> 02:06:58.110
THAT'S A TEPER THAT WAS A

02:06:58.177 --> 02:06:59.511
TEMPORARY A YEAR AND A HALF WE

02:06:59.578 --> 02:07:01.380
IN A PLACE TO LIVE WE KIND OF

02:07:01.447 --> 02:07:03.182
CANCER THE FAMILY ALL OVER THE

02:07:03.248 --> 02:07:07.419
PLACE- BUT IT DISRUPTED THE

02:07:07.486 --> 02:07:08.654
FAMILY AND WE FINALLY KIND OF.

02:07:08.721 --> 02:07:10.556
BECAUSE OF THE HARD WORK OF MY

02:07:10.622 --> 02:07:13.359
FATHER AND MOTHER. WE TOOK CARE

02:07:13.425 --> 02:07:15.728
THAT AND WE BOUNCE BACK BUT I

02:07:15.794 --> 02:07:16.628
THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE TAKE A

02:07:16.695 --> 02:07:19.665
LONGER TIME IT'S HARDER- THEY

02:07:19.732 --> 02:07:22.267
HAVE VARIOUS BARRIERS. THERE

02:07:22.334 --> 02:07:24.937
THERE THERE ARE A LOT OF

02:07:25.004 --> 02:07:26.438
PROBLEMS THE COMPLICATED

02:07:26.505 --> 02:07:28.540
PROBLEMS IT'S NOT JUST ONE

02:07:28.607 --> 02:07:29.675
ANSWER IS THAT THE HOMELESS IS

02:07:29.742 --> 02:07:31.310
NOT JUST PEOPLE THAT HAVE

02:07:31.377 --> 02:07:33.278
MENTALLY ILL AND DRUG ABUSE. I

02:07:33.345 --> 02:07:34.046
THINK THERE'S A LOT OF

02:07:34.113 --> 02:07:36.015
DIFFERENT TYPES OF PEOPLE THERE

02:07:36.081 --> 02:07:37.416
HOMELESS SAY THE- IF YOU GO TO

02:07:37.483 --> 02:07:38.951
THE PEOPLE THAT ACTUALLY COUNT

02:07:39.018 --> 02:07:42.721
THE HOMELESS YOU'LL FIND OUT. I

02:07:42.788 --> 02:07:44.223
THINK WE UNDERESTIMATE FOR

02:07:44.289 --> 02:07:47.493
EXAMPLE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE.

02:07:47.559 --> 02:07:48.927
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IN THE PEOPLE

02:07:48.994 --> 02:07:54.199
IN THE SHELTERS. WE WORK ON

02:07:54.266 --> 02:07:56.835
MENTAL HEALTH I WANT TO. I I'M

02:07:56.902 --> 02:07:58.470
A LITTLE CONCERNED I DON'T WANT

02:07:58.537 --> 02:08:00.572
TO FOCUS ON THE QT BECAUSE I

02:08:00.639 --> 02:08:01.874
THINK WE LEARNED THROUGH A LOT

02:08:01.940 --> 02:08:04.109
OF STUDIES ON MENTAL HEALTH

02:08:04.176 --> 02:08:07.780
THAT WE HAVE TO. FOCUS ON.

02:08:07.846 --> 02:08:08.814
EARLY INTERVENTION AND

02:08:08.881 --> 02:08:12.551
PREVENTION WHERE AND- THERE

02:08:12.618 --> 02:08:16.021
UNDER EIGHTEEN- YOUNG KIDS EVEN

02:08:16.088 --> 02:08:19.058
THE PRE K. THE TRUMP YOU KNOW

02:08:19.124 --> 02:08:21.160
THE TRUMP DRAMATIC EXPERTS IS

02:08:21.226 --> 02:08:22.027
THAT KIDS GO THROUGH WHEN

02:08:22.094 --> 02:08:24.730
THEY'RE TO AFFECT THE NOT THEIR

02:08:24.797 --> 02:08:26.999
THEIR MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS

02:08:27.066 --> 02:08:28.867
I THINK THE SURGEON GENERAL'S

02:08:28.934 --> 02:08:32.337
CORRECT WE SHOULD FOCUS ON THAT.

02:08:32.404 --> 02:08:35.074
I THINK THE EARLY- ALL THESE

02:08:35.140 --> 02:08:37.576
PROGRAMS THAT THE CHAIR IN THE

02:08:37.643 --> 02:08:39.645
CENTER PAN AND OTHERS HAVE

02:08:39.711 --> 02:08:43.515
ADVOCATED FOR. A CHILD CARE-

02:08:43.582 --> 02:08:44.416
THAT'S THAT'S ACTUALLY

02:08:44.483 --> 02:08:46.618
PREVENTING A CUTIE AND THE

02:08:46.685 --> 02:08:48.520
MENTAL HEALTH CARE. IF YOU WANT

02:08:48.587 --> 02:08:49.688
TO BE HONEST ABOUT IT YOU'LL

02:08:49.755 --> 02:08:51.123
HAVE LESS SPECIAL ED KIDS OF

02:08:51.190 --> 02:08:53.358
YOU TAKE CARE OF THEM. EARLY AT

02:08:53.425 --> 02:08:54.660
THE PRESCHOOL PROGRAMS THE

02:08:54.726 --> 02:08:56.895
CHILD CARE PROGRAMS. BUT WE'LL

02:08:56.962 --> 02:08:58.697
WE'LL TO PICK UP EARLIER THE

02:08:58.764 --> 02:09:02.301
FAMILIES SO NEEDS IN TERMS OF A

02:09:02.367 --> 02:09:06.138
KID DO WITH DISABILITIES- THOSE

02:09:06.205 --> 02:09:07.106
KINDS OF ISSUES AND SOME

02:09:07.172 --> 02:09:08.774
FAMILIES DON'T GET DISCERN

02:09:08.841 --> 02:09:13.011
UNTIL IT SO. LIKE FOR PHYSICS

02:09:13.078 --> 02:09:15.214
GREATER EVEN LATER NOT AND

02:09:15.280 --> 02:09:16.782
THAT'S THAT'S WRONG THAT'S

02:09:16.849 --> 02:09:18.851
THAT'S THE DISPARITY RACIAL

02:09:18.917 --> 02:09:21.920
ETHNIC DISPARITIES IN THE

02:09:21.987 --> 02:09:23.755
HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. HAVE TO BE

02:09:23.822 --> 02:09:25.224
ELIMINATED THAT'S WHERE WE HAVE

02:09:25.290 --> 02:09:28.060
TO HAVE THOSE KINDS OF PROGRAMS

02:09:28.127 --> 02:09:31.697
FOR SPECIAL IT MIGHT MY- A

02:09:31.763 --> 02:09:34.466
MENTOR MY MOTHER MY MOTHER. AND

02:09:34.533 --> 02:09:35.367
I STILL HAVE IT IF YOU WANT TO

02:09:35.434 --> 02:09:36.902
LOOK AT IT I THINK I SHOWED YOU

02:09:36.969 --> 02:09:39.204
THIS MY MOTHER DID UP. I ASKED

02:09:39.271 --> 02:09:40.939
HER I SAID WHAT DO YOU THINK WE

02:09:41.006 --> 02:09:41.540
OUGHT TO DO WITH EDUCATION SHE

02:09:41.607 --> 02:09:44.610
SAID. TRAINED AS TEACHERS AND

02:09:44.676 --> 02:09:46.411
GIVE THEM EXTRA AFTER TAKING

02:09:46.478 --> 02:09:49.114
CARE OF. KIDS AND- KIDS IN

02:09:49.181 --> 02:09:51.316
NEIGHBORHOODS THAT ARE HARDER.

02:09:51.383 --> 02:09:53.852
TO TEACH AND- HELP THE SPECIAL

02:09:53.919 --> 02:09:56.388
ED TEACHERS. WITH BENEFITS IN

02:09:56.455 --> 02:09:59.391
TRAINING. AND THE GOVERNOR I

02:09:59.458 --> 02:10:01.093
SHOW THE GOVERNOR. ABOUT THIS

02:10:01.160 --> 02:10:02.728
TIME LAST YEAR MY MOTHER'S.

02:10:02.794 --> 02:10:05.097
VIDEOTAPE I GUESS YOU LISTEN TO

02:10:05.164 --> 02:10:08.367
MAMA. AND HE PUT SOME MONEY IN

02:10:08.433 --> 02:10:10.235
THE BUDGET SO I APPRECIATE THAT.

02:10:10.302 --> 02:10:11.537
I THINK THE GOVERNOR'S LISTEN

02:10:11.603 --> 02:10:13.272
TO MY MAMA SHE'S NINETY THREE

02:10:13.338 --> 02:10:15.541
YEARS OLD RIGHT AND SHE STOPPED

02:10:15.607 --> 02:10:19.044
TO CHEN WHEN SHE WAS ABOUT

02:10:19.111 --> 02:10:19.878
EIGHTY SIX. SO SHE TALKED TO

02:10:19.945 --> 02:10:20.812
SHE WAS ABOUT EIGHTY SIX SO I

02:10:20.879 --> 02:10:24.683
APPRECIATE. DEALING WITH THE

02:10:24.750 --> 02:10:27.986
SPECIAL ED. PROGRAM IN AND MORE

02:10:28.053 --> 02:10:29.354
OF A STRATEGIC VIEW I THINK

02:10:29.421 --> 02:10:31.657
THAT'S IMPORTANT. ESPECIALLY

02:10:31.723 --> 02:10:34.493
FOR MAYOR OF COURSE- A DAD OF

02:10:34.560 --> 02:10:35.694
SOMEBODY THAT WENT THROUGH THE

02:10:35.761 --> 02:10:37.796
SPECIAL ED SYSTEM. WITH

02:10:37.863 --> 02:10:41.700
DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES SO.

02:10:41.767 --> 02:10:43.202
THE LAST THING I WANT TO RAISE

02:10:43.268 --> 02:10:44.970
MIDDLEMAN CHURN I THINK. YOU'VE

02:10:45.037 --> 02:10:48.740
HEARD FROM ME BEFORE. YOU'RE

02:10:48.807 --> 02:10:51.843
NOT GONNA YOU'RE NOT GONNA.

02:10:51.910 --> 02:10:52.945
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO UNDERSTAND

02:10:53.011 --> 02:10:54.646
HOMELESS AND LESS YOU

02:10:54.713 --> 02:10:57.349
UNDERSTAND SSI. THERE'S ALL

02:10:57.416 --> 02:10:59.885
THERE'S ONE POINT TWO MILLION

02:10:59.952 --> 02:11:04.323
PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA ON SSI.

02:11:04.389 --> 02:11:06.792
GIVING THEM A HAIR CUT IN TERMS

02:11:06.858 --> 02:11:12.030
OF. THE INCREASED S. ASIDE IS

02:11:12.097 --> 02:11:14.399
NOT A GOOD IDEA IF YOU WANT TO

02:11:14.466 --> 02:11:16.201
SOLVE YOUR HOMELESS PROBLEM.

02:11:16.268 --> 02:11:17.502
BECAUSE A LOT OF THE PEOPLE

02:11:17.569 --> 02:11:19.705
THAT FALL INTO PRO HOMELESS

02:11:19.771 --> 02:11:22.040
ACTUALLY ARE PEOPLE. THAT

02:11:22.107 --> 02:11:25.611
EITHER ELIGIBLE. FOR MORE ON

02:11:25.677 --> 02:11:28.046
SSI AND ARE LOSING THEIR GROUP

02:11:28.113 --> 02:11:29.181
HOMES THEY'RE LOSING THEIR

02:11:29.248 --> 02:11:31.149
HOUSING THEY DON'T HAVE ENOUGH

02:11:31.216 --> 02:11:33.285
MONEY FOR THE HOUSING VOUCHER-

02:11:33.352 --> 02:11:34.886
THEY MAY BE DISABLED AND NOT

02:11:34.953 --> 02:11:37.856
GETTING PROPER CARE. OF THEY

02:11:37.923 --> 02:11:39.658
MAY BE AN ELDERLY PERSON THAT

02:11:39.725 --> 02:11:40.892
BECAME HOMELESS WE'RE STARTING

02:11:40.959 --> 02:11:42.761
TO SEE MORE ELDERLY. THAT ARE

02:11:42.828 --> 02:11:45.931
HOMELESS. IT'S AMAZING HOW MANY

02:11:45.998 --> 02:11:47.199
ELDERLY PEOPLE I SEE IN MY

02:11:47.266 --> 02:11:50.102
COMMUNITY WHICH- SAN JOSE IS

02:11:50.168 --> 02:11:51.870
THE ABOUT THE SECOND I THINK

02:11:51.937 --> 02:11:52.938
WE'RE THE NUMBER TWO IN TERMS

02:11:53.005 --> 02:11:55.107
OF HOMELESS. THE SAN JOSE

02:11:55.173 --> 02:11:56.908
COMMUNITY IS A NUMBER TO

02:11:56.975 --> 02:11:59.278
SECRETARY. IN TERMS OF THE

02:11:59.344 --> 02:12:02.814
COUNTS. OF SO THERE'S A LOT OF

02:12:02.881 --> 02:12:03.315
ELDERLY THAT HAVE BECOME

02:12:03.382 --> 02:12:07.419
HOMELESS. AND I THINK WE HAVE

02:12:07.486 --> 02:12:10.122
TO RECOGNIZE IT SSI BENEFITS

02:12:10.188 --> 02:12:12.524
SHOULD BE INCREASED AND I THINK

02:12:12.591 --> 02:12:15.127
THAT THIRTEEN DOLLARS. IS

02:12:15.193 --> 02:12:16.828
PARSIMONIOUS AND SHOULD BE

02:12:16.895 --> 02:12:19.798
LOOKED OUT. TO MAKE SURE THAT

02:12:19.865 --> 02:12:20.432
THAT'S GOING TO BE AN EFFECTIVE

02:12:20.499 --> 02:12:24.069
AMOUNT. AND NOT BE A HINDRANCE

02:12:24.136 --> 02:12:25.103
IN SOLVING THE HOMELESS

02:12:25.170 --> 02:12:27.572
PROBLEM. IS I THINK PEOPLE NEED

02:12:27.639 --> 02:12:32.811
THE INCOME TO. PAY FOR THE NEXT

02:12:32.878 --> 02:12:35.814
WEEK'S RANT THAT THEY NEED TO

02:12:35.881 --> 02:12:37.349
SURVIVE AND I THINK THIRTEEN

02:12:37.416 --> 02:12:39.985
DOLLARS. I DON'T THINK IT I

02:12:40.052 --> 02:12:40.886
DON'T THINK IT'S ENOUGH I THINK

02:12:40.952 --> 02:12:43.288
IT SHOULD BE INCREASED SO THANK

02:12:43.355 --> 02:12:46.458

02:12:46.525 --> 02:12:47.826

SAFETY NET. SO MY LAST BUDGET.

02:12:52.698 --> 02:12:54.099
I HAVE TO GIVE A SHOUT OUT FOR

02:12:54.166 --> 02:12:55.801
EVERYBODY THAT THE DAY CARES

02:12:55.867 --> 02:12:58.003
ABOUT THIS AND- I THINK

02:12:58.070 --> 02:13:01.340
GOVERNOR NEWSOME IS ON HIS WAY

02:13:01.406 --> 02:13:02.341

02:13:02.407 --> 02:13:06.912
TO. FINALIZES STRATEGIES. AND

02:13:06.978 --> 02:13:08.280
COME UP WITH SOME ONGOING WAYS

02:13:08.347 --> 02:13:09.981
OF FINDING OUT I THINK THAT'S

02:13:10.048 --> 02:13:11.917
THE BOTTOM LINE FOR HIM. SO

02:13:11.983 --> 02:13:13.251

SOME SOLUTIONS I THINK THAT IS

02:13:29.568 --> 02:13:33.205
VERY MUCH A VALUABLE TOOL. THAT

02:13:33.271 --> 02:13:35.273
HE'S BEEN FOCUSING ON AND WOULD

02:13:35.340 --> 02:13:36.174
HOPE THAT IS GONNA GET SOME

02:13:36.241 --> 02:13:37.843
CONSIDERATION. UNDERSTANDING

02:13:37.909 --> 02:13:39.144
THAT THE ADMINISTRATION WILL

02:13:39.211 --> 02:13:40.379
HAVE AN ALTERNATIVE POINT OF

02:13:40.445 --> 02:13:42.581
VIEW- IN POTENTIAL AVENUE TO BE

02:13:42.647 --> 02:13:44.549
ABLE TO ADVANCE BUT I THINK-

02:13:44.616 --> 02:13:46.418
THE SINNERS HARD WORK- SHOULD

02:13:46.485 --> 02:13:48.553
BE EVALUATED SERIOUSLY. TAKE A

02:13:48.620 --> 02:13:50.322
LOOK AT A GLOBAL VIEW PRETTY

02:13:50.389 --> 02:13:52.924
CHAIR ON TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN

02:13:52.991 --> 02:13:56.795
DECISION BE EIGHT CODE. I'D ALL

02:13:56.862 --> 02:13:58.263
THOSE WHO ARE FOR AND OF WAS

02:13:58.330 --> 02:13:59.398
NOT IN THE ROLE THAT YOU WERE

02:13:59.464 --> 02:14:02.367
AT THIS POINT. BUT THAT IS-

02:14:02.434 --> 02:14:04.436
TAKING EXCESS PROPERTY TAX

02:14:04.503 --> 02:14:06.405
ALLOCATION THAT WAS DEDICATED

02:14:06.471 --> 02:14:09.408
TO SCHOOLS AND THEN TAKING IT-

02:14:09.474 --> 02:14:13.211
AND FINDING A TRIAL COURT'S. SO

02:14:13.278 --> 02:14:14.813
I THINK LAST YEAR IT WAS

02:14:14.880 --> 02:14:16.148
APPROXIMATELY NINETY MILLION

02:14:16.214 --> 02:14:18.717

FUNDING. WHICH IS FUNDING TRIAL

02:14:22.788 --> 02:14:24.389
COURTS NOW UNDERSTAND THAT THE

02:14:24.456 --> 02:14:25.557
LEGISLATURE AND I THINK IN A

02:14:25.624 --> 02:14:27.325
TRAILER BILL IN TWO THOUSAND

02:14:27.392 --> 02:14:29.428
THIRTEEN ADVANCE THAT. SIGNED

02:14:29.494 --> 02:14:30.829
BY THE GOVERNOR I THINK THAT IT

02:14:30.896 --> 02:14:32.697
NEEDS TO BE REVIEWED ESPECIALLY

02:14:32.764 --> 02:14:34.699
IF WE'RE SERIOUS ABOUT MOVING

02:14:34.766 --> 02:14:36.001
THE BALL FORWARD ON EIGHTY

02:14:36.067 --> 02:14:38.837

THE FIRST IS THAT- BOTH LAST

02:18:48.720 --> 02:18:52.023

PARTICULAR CAPITAL GAINS GROWS

02:18:54.526 --> 02:18:56.728
ABOUT EXPECTATIONS SO- WHEN THE

TWENTY EIGHTEEN TWENTY

02:19:00.632 --> 02:19:01.800
NINETEEN. WE SAW A SIGNIFICANT

02:19:01.866 --> 02:19:03.768
DROP IN THE STOCK MARKET- BUT

02:19:03.835 --> 02:19:05.403
NOW THAT WE'RE IN TWENTY TWENTY

02:19:05.470 --> 02:19:06.805
WE CAN LOOK BACK AND LOOK AT

02:19:06.871 --> 02:19:08.206
THE TWENTY NINETEEN YEAR AND WE

02:19:08.273 --> 02:19:10.008

02:19:10.075 --> 02:19:10.975
STOCK MARKET GROWTH YOU KNOW

02:19:11.042 --> 02:19:12.744

THE ECONOMY CONTINUING TO GROW

02:19:20.952 --> 02:19:21.553

02:19:21.619 --> 02:19:23.421
REVENUES ARE GOING UP. AT THE

02:19:23.488 --> 02:19:25.156
SAME TIME WE ARE PROJECTING

02:19:25.223 --> 02:19:26.825
SLOWING GROWTH IN EACH OF THE

NEXT SEVERAL YEARS AND THAT'S

02:19:28.126 --> 02:19:29.561
WHY EVEN THOUGH YOU DO SEE

02:20:02.660 --> 02:20:04.295
WE ARE PROTECTING OUR MULTI

02:20:04.362 --> 02:20:06.965
YEAR SONG EXPENDITURES AND THEN

02:20:07.031 --> 02:20:07.532
I THINK THE OTHER AND YOU'RE

02:20:07.599 --> 02:20:08.833
COMFORTABLE WITH THOSE NUMBERS.

02:20:08.900 --> 02:20:10.301
YES WE WOULD OF COURSE A LOT OF

02:20:10.368 --> 02:20:11.736
THE REVENUES TO BE WE ARE

02:20:11.803 --> 02:20:12.771
HOPING THEIR AVENUES WILL BE

02:20:12.837 --> 02:20:14.139
HIGHER BUT THAT CERTAINLY THE

02:20:14.205 --> 02:20:15.840
WAY THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT IT.

02:20:15.907 --> 02:20:17.242
RIGHT NOW AND THEN MYCOLOGY

02:20:17.308 --> 02:20:18.376
CHAMBERLAIN WHO LEADS ARE

02:20:18.443 --> 02:20:22.213
REVENUE UNIT. MAY WANT TO MAKE

02:20:22.280 --> 02:20:25.049
AN ADDITIONAL COMMENT. I'M

02:20:25.116 --> 02:20:27.519
ACTUALLY I THINK OKAY. YOU

02:20:27.585 --> 02:20:29.621
COVER ALL COME TO THE LA WE

02:20:29.687 --> 02:20:32.590
OFTEN OF TRIED YOU BOTH TO THIS

02:20:32.657 --> 02:20:33.792
OVERSIGHT HERE IN TERMS OF YOU

02:20:33.858 --> 02:20:34.826
KNOW WHO'S PROJECTIONS ARE

02:20:34.893 --> 02:20:36.694
HIGHER WHOSE LOWER WHO WAS

02:20:36.761 --> 02:20:38.329
CLOSER TO REALITY THE YEAR

02:20:38.396 --> 02:20:40.598
BEFORE. AND SO I DON'T

02:20:40.665 --> 02:20:43.401
REMEMBER- MY NINE YEARS NOW IN

02:20:43.468 --> 02:20:46.004
THE LEGISLATURE A TIME WHEN-

02:20:46.070 --> 02:20:47.839
FINANCE AND ELLIE OWES

02:20:47.906 --> 02:20:50.275
PROJECTIONS WERE SO CLOSE- IS

02:20:50.341 --> 02:20:51.910
THAT TELL ME WHY YOU THINK THAT

02:20:51.976 --> 02:20:53.678
IS THERE ARE YOU ENGAGE IN A

02:20:53.745 --> 02:20:56.714
NEW. METHOD OF MODELING OR-

02:20:56.781 --> 02:20:58.249
WELL EVERYBODY SHARING THE SAME

02:20:58.316 --> 02:21:00.718
CRYSTAL BALL NOW HOW DO WE GET

02:21:00.785 --> 02:21:03.922
THERE- WILL LET ME START WITH A

02:21:03.988 --> 02:21:04.856
HIGH LEVEL COM IN THE MY

02:21:04.923 --> 02:21:07.892
COLLEAGUE BRIAN CAN- WAY IN. WE

02:21:07.959 --> 02:21:10.662
HAVE VERY SIMILAR REVENUES FOR

02:21:10.728 --> 02:21:12.263
THE THREE YEARS THAT MAKE UP

02:21:12.330 --> 02:21:13.698
THE BUDGET WINDOW AS I

02:21:13.765 --> 02:21:16.501
MENTIONED IN THE OPENING. SO

02:21:16.568 --> 02:21:18.503
THE ONE THING I WOULD SAY ABOUT

02:21:18.570 --> 02:21:19.971
THAT THOUGH IS THAT THE

02:21:20.038 --> 02:21:21.339
COMPONENTS OF OUR REVENUE

02:21:21.406 --> 02:21:22.440
GROWTH ARE ACTUALLY A LITTLE

02:21:22.507 --> 02:21:24.809
BIT DIFFERENT WE HAVE. MORE OF

02:21:24.876 --> 02:21:25.977
OUR REVENUES IN THE PERSONAL

02:21:26.044 --> 02:21:27.245
INCOME TAX AND I THINK

02:21:27.312 --> 02:21:29.747
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCES. SEEN

02:21:29.814 --> 02:21:31.282
SOME MORE REVENUE IN THE

02:21:31.349 --> 02:21:33.985
CORPORATION TAX AND THEN. I

02:21:34.052 --> 02:21:35.486
THINK ONE IMPLICATION OF THAT

02:21:35.553 --> 02:21:36.487
IS THAT WHEN YOU LOOK TO THE

02:21:36.554 --> 02:21:39.023
OUT YEAR WITH OUR PERSONAL

02:21:39.090 --> 02:21:41.726
INCOME TAX- HIM DRIVING IT

02:21:41.793 --> 02:21:43.194
THERE IS. OUR OUR L. YOUR

02:21:43.261 --> 02:21:44.562
REVENUES ARE SOMEWHAT HIGHER

02:21:44.629 --> 02:21:48.066
THAN THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE

02:21:48.132 --> 02:21:49.667
PART OF THE REASON I DON'T KNOW

02:21:49.734 --> 02:21:51.870
BRIAN IF YOU CAN. SETTLEMENT

02:21:51.936 --> 02:21:53.037
YEAH I MEAN I THINK ONE FACTOR

02:21:53.104 --> 02:21:54.672
THAT SOME PLAY HERE IS JUST THE

02:21:54.739 --> 02:21:55.773
KIND OF THE POINT IN THE

02:21:55.840 --> 02:21:57.208
ECONOMIC CYCLE OR AND I THINK

02:21:57.275 --> 02:21:58.209
THAT A LOT OF THOSE EARLIER

02:21:58.276 --> 02:21:59.277
YEARS AND WE WERE HAVING KIND

02:21:59.344 --> 02:22:00.979
OF MORE TURBULENT BUDGETS IN

02:22:01.045 --> 02:22:02.380
THE ECONOMY WAS. JUST COMING

02:22:02.447 --> 02:22:03.514
OUT OF THE RECESSION AND IT WAS

02:22:03.581 --> 02:22:05.416
A LITTLE HARDER TO KNOW YOU

02:22:05.483 --> 02:22:06.317
KNOW WHERE IT WHAT'S THE PATH

02:22:06.384 --> 02:22:07.352
IT'S GOING TO TAKE OVER THE

02:22:07.418 --> 02:22:09.487
NEXT YEAR. AS THE RECOVERIES

02:22:09.554 --> 02:22:10.922
YOU KNOW KIND OF MOVED ALONG

02:22:10.989 --> 02:22:12.156
WE'VE WE'VE BEEN KIND OF

02:22:12.223 --> 02:22:13.291
STEADILY TRENDING UPWARD IN A

02:22:13.358 --> 02:22:15.026
WAY THAT. NOT JUST OUR OFFICES

02:22:15.093 --> 02:22:16.494
BUT THE KIND OF THE CONSENSUS

02:22:16.561 --> 02:22:17.962
ECONOMIC FORECAST SO WE BOTH

02:22:18.029 --> 02:22:19.697
LOOK TO. YOU KNOW THEY'VE ALL

02:22:19.764 --> 02:22:21.966
KIND OF TENDED TOWARDS TO

02:22:22.033 --> 02:22:23.368
GATHER AROUND YOU KNOW A MORE.

02:22:23.434 --> 02:22:25.270
TIGHT CONSENSUS AS YOU KNOW THE

02:22:25.336 --> 02:22:26.404
STRAINS OF ALL KIND OF

02:22:26.471 --> 02:22:29.340
CONTINUED ON GRADUALLY- YOU

02:22:29.407 --> 02:22:31.509
KNOW I THINK AS AS AS GAVE IS

02:22:31.576 --> 02:22:32.543
MENTIONED YOU KNOW I THINK THAT

02:22:32.610 --> 02:22:33.945
THERE'S MAYBE SOME. SOME

02:22:34.012 --> 02:22:35.113
GROWING RISKS THAT SOME OF THAT

02:22:35.179 --> 02:22:36.481
TURBULENCE COULD BE COMING BACK

02:22:36.547 --> 02:22:37.749
IN THE NEXT TWO YEARS YOU KNOW

02:22:37.815 --> 02:22:39.584
WE IN THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE

02:22:39.651 --> 02:22:41.920
DON'T. FORECASTERS SESSIONS AND

02:22:41.986 --> 02:22:43.821
SO THAT IS YOU KNOW PART OF WHY

02:22:43.888 --> 02:22:45.623
WE CONTINUE ON THAT KIND OF

02:22:45.690 --> 02:22:48.259
GRADUAL TREND- SO I THINK YOU

02:22:48.326 --> 02:22:49.894
KNOW KIND OF THE- THAT'S

02:22:49.961 --> 02:22:52.130
PROBABLY PART OF WHY. WE'RE

02:22:52.196 --> 02:22:55.033
MAYBE A LITTLE CLOSER THAN WE

02:22:55.099 --> 02:22:55.633
HAVE BEEN IN SOME OF THE PAST

02:22:55.700 --> 02:22:57.368
YEARS. THANK YOU FOR THAT I'M

02:22:57.435 --> 02:22:59.137
GONNA MOVE QUICKLY INTO OUR-

02:22:59.203 --> 02:23:01.339
RECESSION MITIGATION TO THE LA

02:23:01.406 --> 02:23:03.341
ALL. IN THE HANDOUT YOU GAVE US

02:23:03.408 --> 02:23:05.276
TODAY YOU AGAIN ENCOURAGE A

02:23:05.343 --> 02:23:06.444
LEGISLATURE DETERMINE WHETHER

02:23:06.511 --> 02:23:07.812
IT WE'RE SATISFIED WITH THE

02:23:07.879 --> 02:23:09.047
LEVEL THE LEVEL OF RESERVES

02:23:09.113 --> 02:23:11.282
PROPOSED- IN THIS YEAR'S

02:23:11.349 --> 02:23:13.918
BUDGET- I CONTINUE TO BE.

02:23:13.985 --> 02:23:15.753
CURIOUS AS TO YOUR THOUGHTS ON

02:23:15.820 --> 02:23:17.789
WHAT YOU THINK THE APPROPRIATE.

02:23:17.855 --> 02:23:20.258
LEVEL OF RESERVE SHOULD BE. IF

02:23:20.325 --> 02:23:21.292
YOU COULD FIND ON THAT YEAH

02:23:21.359 --> 02:23:23.361
WELL. IT RELEASED THE TARGET

02:23:23.428 --> 02:23:27.999
YES IT'S THE- KIND OF. SIXTY

02:23:28.066 --> 02:23:28.633
FOUR BILLION DOLLAR QUESTION IT

02:23:28.700 --> 02:23:32.637
IS. AGAINST OVERSIGHT- SO I

02:23:32.704 --> 02:23:36.341
THINK. IT DEPENDS ON HOW YOU

02:23:36.407 --> 02:23:38.710
VIEW THE WORLD IN CERTAIN WAYS

02:23:38.776 --> 02:23:40.044
ONE IS WHAT KIND OF A RECESSION

02:23:40.111 --> 02:23:42.013
ARE YOU CONTEMPLATING PREPARING

02:23:42.080 --> 02:23:43.881
FOR- THE MORE SEVERE THE

02:23:43.948 --> 02:23:45.550
RECESSION THAT OBVIOUSLY THEY

02:23:45.616 --> 02:23:47.151
GREATER CUSHION THAT YOU WOULD

02:23:47.218 --> 02:23:49.954
NEED. AND THEN ALSO WHAT IS THE

02:23:50.021 --> 02:23:51.789
STATE'S CURRENT SPENDING

02:23:51.856 --> 02:23:53.424
TRAJECTORY RELATIVE TO ITS

02:23:53.491 --> 02:23:55.059
REVENUE GROWTH- IN THE

02:23:55.126 --> 02:23:56.094
THROUGHOUT THE MULTI YEAR

02:23:56.160 --> 02:23:58.129
PERIOD AND TO THE EXTENT THAT

02:23:58.196 --> 02:23:59.797
THERE'S NOT A LOT OF SPACE

02:23:59.864 --> 02:24:02.634
BETWEEN THOSE TWO- VARIABLES

02:24:02.700 --> 02:24:06.404
THAN. THE SHORTFALL REVENUE

02:24:06.471 --> 02:24:07.638
THAT WOULD OCCUR IN A RECESSION

02:24:07.705 --> 02:24:09.807
AND WOOD MORE IMMEDIATELY NEED

02:24:09.874 --> 02:24:11.776
TO BE OFFSET BY EITHER USE OF

02:24:11.843 --> 02:24:13.978
RESERVES OR CUTS TO PROGRAMS OR

02:24:14.045 --> 02:24:16.481
SOME KIND OF INCREASED REVENUES

02:24:16.547 --> 02:24:19.384
SO WITH THAT I DON'T KNOW IF

02:24:19.450 --> 02:24:21.853
YOU KNOW WE'VE DONE SOME SOME

02:24:21.919 --> 02:24:24.655
ESTIMATING OF WHAT THE EFFECT

02:24:24.722 --> 02:24:26.224
OF A RECESSION WOULD BE AND WE

02:24:26.290 --> 02:24:27.825
TOOK WHEN WE DID OUR FISCAL

02:24:27.892 --> 02:24:29.827
OUTLOOK IN THE FALL WE TOOK THE

02:24:29.894 --> 02:24:32.063
AVERAGE- TYPE OF RECESSION

02:24:32.130 --> 02:24:33.931
SINCE WORLD WAR TWO THERE BEEN

02:24:33.998 --> 02:24:34.999
TWELVE RECESSIONS WE KIND OF

02:24:35.066 --> 02:24:37.535
AVERAGE THE- THE METRICS THAT.

02:24:37.602 --> 02:24:39.971
WITH THAT- THOSE REPRESENTED

02:24:40.038 --> 02:24:41.606
AND WHEN YOU DID THAT AND YOU

02:24:41.672 --> 02:24:43.374
COMPARED IT TO THE STATE'S

02:24:43.441 --> 02:24:45.176
CURRENT RISEN PROJECTED

02:24:45.243 --> 02:24:47.245
RESERVES AT THAT TIME PLUS WHAT

02:24:47.311 --> 02:24:49.514
WE VENN PROJECTED THE- BUDGET

02:24:49.580 --> 02:24:52.050
SURPLUS TO BE. ASSUMING NO NEW

02:24:52.116 --> 02:24:53.818
COMMITMENTS ARE MADE OUR

02:24:53.885 --> 02:24:55.319
OUTLOOK SAID WELL YOU WOULD

02:24:55.386 --> 02:24:57.021
PROBABLY BE PRETTY CLOSE TO

02:24:57.088 --> 02:24:58.823
HAVING ENOUGH TO WITHSTAND THAT

02:24:58.890 --> 02:25:00.425
BUT OF COURSE IF YOU YEAH

02:25:00.491 --> 02:25:01.893
THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS MAKE

02:25:01.959 --> 02:25:04.896
NEW COMMITMENTS- HEN THEN THAT

02:25:04.962 --> 02:25:05.863
PICTURE COULD CHANGE AND THEN

02:25:05.930 --> 02:25:07.031
WE ALSO POINTED OUT YOU KNOW

02:25:07.098 --> 02:25:08.199
WE'VE BEEN TALKING TODAY ABOUT

02:25:08.266 --> 02:25:09.467
THE OTHER RISKS THAT ARE OUT

02:25:09.534 --> 02:25:10.968
THERE SO IF YOU HAD A RECESSION

02:25:11.035 --> 02:25:12.303
IN ANY OF THOSE OTHER RHYS

02:25:12.370 --> 02:25:14.172
HAPPEN AT THE SAME TIME. THEN

02:25:14.238 --> 02:25:17.375
IT WOULD BE- EVEN MORE OF A

02:25:17.442 --> 02:25:18.910
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT YOU

02:25:18.976 --> 02:25:20.578
HAVE AND WHAT YOU WOULD NEED

02:25:20.645 --> 02:25:23.548
BUT I THINK- I THINK- IN

02:25:23.614 --> 02:25:24.949
GENERAL THE STATE IS MADE GREAT

02:25:25.016 --> 02:25:29.754
PROGRESS IN RECENT YEARS. AND

02:25:29.821 --> 02:25:30.455
AT END OF THE DAY THIS THE

02:25:30.521 --> 02:25:31.089
ANSWER ISN'T THE SADDEST

02:25:31.155 --> 02:25:33.691
BECAUSE I THINK. TO SAY WHETHER

02:25:33.758 --> 02:25:34.792
OR NOT THE STATE IS READY

02:25:34.859 --> 02:25:36.194
REALLY DEPENDS ON THE

02:25:36.260 --> 02:25:38.229
COLLECTIVE RISK TOLERANCE OF

02:25:38.296 --> 02:25:41.199
THE KEY DECISION MAKERS. THANK

02:25:41.265 --> 02:25:44.368
YOU- MISTER THIS ONE OFTEN WHAT

02:25:44.435 --> 02:25:46.671
ARE YOU COMFORTABLE. KIND OF

02:25:46.737 --> 02:25:48.873
WAYNE IN IN TERMS OF ON BEHALF

02:25:48.940 --> 02:25:51.876
OF THE ADMINISTRATION- DO YOU

02:25:51.943 --> 02:25:53.377
THINK YOUR PROPOSAL LEAVES THE

02:25:53.444 --> 02:25:55.446
STATE AND OR OR WHERE DO YOU

02:25:55.513 --> 02:25:56.514
THINK YOUR PROPOSAL LEAVES THE

02:25:56.581 --> 02:25:59.584
STATE. IN A POSITION IN TERMS

02:25:59.650 --> 02:26:00.852
OF BEING ABLE TO MINUTE

02:26:00.918 --> 02:26:02.753
MITIGATE OUR MANAGE OUR WAY

02:26:02.820 --> 02:26:04.155
THROUGH UP AT LEAST A MODERATE

02:26:04.222 --> 02:26:06.557
RECESSION SCENARIO. YES SO ALL

02:26:06.624 --> 02:26:07.658
MAKE A COUPLE OF BRIEF

02:26:07.725 --> 02:26:08.926
COMMENTS- THE FIRST IS OUR

02:26:08.993 --> 02:26:10.428
OVERALL RECESSION SCENARIO

02:26:10.495 --> 02:26:12.730
WHICH WE RAN AGAIN IS SIMILAR

02:26:12.797 --> 02:26:14.298
TO LAST YEAR WHICH IS WHERE IN

02:26:14.365 --> 02:26:15.967
A RECESSION THAT IS. MAYBE NOT

02:26:16.033 --> 02:26:17.368
QUITE AS SEVERE AS WHAT WE SAW

02:26:17.435 --> 02:26:18.402
DURING THE GREAT RECESSION BUT

02:26:18.469 --> 02:26:20.037
STILL PRETTY SEVERE WE COULD

02:26:20.104 --> 02:26:22.673
EXPERIENCE REVENUE DROPS OF UP

02:26:22.740 --> 02:26:23.474
TO TWENTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS

02:26:23.541 --> 02:26:24.842
IN A SINGLE YEAR AND UP TO

02:26:24.909 --> 02:26:26.777
NEARLY SEVENTY BILLION DOLLARS.

02:26:26.844 --> 02:26:28.312
OVER THREE YEARS TO SIR

02:26:28.379 --> 02:26:29.814
CERTAINLY WE'RE VERY CONCERNED

02:26:29.881 --> 02:26:31.249
ABOUT THAT WHEN IT COMES TO.

02:26:31.315 --> 02:26:33.017
HOW PREPARED WE FEEL I THINK

02:26:33.084 --> 02:26:34.619
THE FIRST POINT I MAKE IS ARE

02:26:34.685 --> 02:26:36.487
PROJECTED RESERVES LEVEL OF

02:26:36.554 --> 02:26:37.688
TWENTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS FOR

02:26:37.755 --> 02:26:39.257
THE END OF THE BUDGET YEAR. IS

02:26:39.323 --> 02:26:41.626
NOT ONLY- HI FOR CALIFORNIA BUT

02:26:41.692 --> 02:26:42.660
IT'S ALSO IF YOU COMPARE TO

02:26:42.727 --> 02:26:44.428
OTHER STATES AND YOU LOOK AT IT

02:26:44.495 --> 02:26:45.396
AS A PERCENTAGE OF OVERALL

02:26:45.463 --> 02:26:47.165
GENERAL FUND SPENDING- WORK

02:26:47.231 --> 02:26:48.599
COMFORTABLY IN THE UPPER TIER

02:26:48.666 --> 02:26:50.201
AT COMPARED TO OTHER STATES AND

02:26:50.268 --> 02:26:51.769
I THINK THAT WAS REFLECTED. IN

02:26:51.836 --> 02:26:52.970
THE RATINGS UPGRADE- THAT WE

02:26:53.037 --> 02:26:55.006
RECEIVED- LAST YEAR AFTER THE

02:26:55.072 --> 02:26:55.973
BUDGET WAS ENACTED BY THE

02:26:56.040 --> 02:26:57.642
LEGISLATURE IT DOESN'T MEAN WE

02:26:57.708 --> 02:26:59.377
CAN REST EASY TWENTY ONE

02:26:59.443 --> 02:27:00.978
BILLION DOLLARS IS NOT SEVENTY

02:27:01.045 --> 02:27:01.846
BILLION DOLLARS OR FORTY

02:27:01.913 --> 02:27:03.581
BILLION DOLLARS. BUT I THINK

02:27:03.648 --> 02:27:05.349
THE ADMINISTRATION FEELS MORE

02:27:05.416 --> 02:27:05.983
COMFORTABLE NOW THAT WERE IN

02:27:06.050 --> 02:27:07.752
THIS POSITION. THE SECOND POINT

02:27:07.818 --> 02:27:08.886
THAT I WANT TO MAKE IT SOME OF

02:27:08.953 --> 02:27:10.688
THE INVESTMENTS MADE LAST YEAR

02:27:10.755 --> 02:27:12.256
WERE AS YOU KNOW FOR SEVERAL

02:27:12.323 --> 02:27:13.357
BILLION DOLLARS FOR THE PENSION

02:27:13.424 --> 02:27:15.293
PAY DOWN AS WELL AS TO PAY OFF

02:27:15.359 --> 02:27:17.161
THE WALL JACK. AND SO THESE ARE

02:27:17.228 --> 02:27:18.496
INVESTMENTS THAT THE

02:27:18.563 --> 02:27:19.630
LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR

02:27:19.697 --> 02:27:21.332
COULD HAVE SAID HEY WE DON'T

02:27:21.399 --> 02:27:22.500
WANT TODO THESE THINGS WE WANT

02:27:22.567 --> 02:27:24.135
TO PUT THEM INTO RESERVES. AND

02:27:24.202 --> 02:27:24.835
THAT WOULD HAVE MADE THE

02:27:24.902 --> 02:27:26.237
RESERVES LEVEL EVEN HIGHER

02:27:26.304 --> 02:27:27.872
MAYBE IT WOULD'VE BEEN TWENTY

02:27:27.939 --> 02:27:28.573
FOUR OR TWENTY FIVE BILLION

02:27:28.639 --> 02:27:30.541
DOLLARS- BUT WE ALSO THOUGHT

02:27:30.608 --> 02:27:31.676
THAT THESE OTHER PRIORITIES

02:27:31.742 --> 02:27:33.110
BUILD FISCAL RESILIENCY AS WELL

02:27:33.177 --> 02:27:34.378
AND OF COURSE THE DEBATE THAT

02:27:34.445 --> 02:27:36.047
WE OFTEN HAD THESE. RESERVES

02:27:36.113 --> 02:27:38.282
VERSUS. SPENDING ON ONE TIME OR

02:27:38.349 --> 02:27:41.219
ONGOING PROGRAMS BUT IT'S ALSO

02:27:41.285 --> 02:27:44.188
WE'RE THINKING A ABOUT RESERVES

02:27:44.255 --> 02:27:45.323
PERSIST. ON PAID ARE PAN OFF

02:27:45.389 --> 02:27:46.891
OTHER. I'M SO WEEKS UP A SLIGHT

02:27:46.958 --> 02:27:47.792
LOWER. WHILE BUT WE DO THINK

02:27:47.858 --> 02:27:48.859
THOSE. IN FACT THEY ALMOST

02:27:48.926 --> 02:27:50.328
CERTAINLY WILL BENEFIT US OVER

02:27:50.394 --> 02:27:51.896
THE LONGER TERM. AND THEN THE

02:27:51.963 --> 02:27:53.231
LAST POINT I'LL MAKE IS THAT

02:27:53.297 --> 02:27:55.132
WITH THAT BSA IN A YOU MENTION

02:27:55.199 --> 02:27:56.167
THE BUDGET STABILIZATION

02:27:56.234 --> 02:27:57.702
ACCOUNT. WITH THE DEPOSIT

02:27:57.768 --> 02:27:59.337
PROJECTED THIS YEAR WILL BE AT

02:27:59.403 --> 02:28:01.539
NINE POINT 8% OF THAT. CONCERT

02:28:01.606 --> 02:28:03.207
TOUR THE CONSTITUTIONAL 10%

02:28:03.274 --> 02:28:04.976
CAP- AND THAT'S JUST WHAT THE

02:28:05.042 --> 02:28:06.377
MANDATORY DEPOSIT SO WHEN YOU

02:28:06.444 --> 02:28:08.045
THINK ABOUT. MANDATORY FOR AB

02:28:08.112 --> 02:28:10.314
PLUS DISCRETIONARY WERE ABOUT

02:28:10.381 --> 02:28:12.350
13% OF GENERAL FUND. REVENUES

02:28:12.416 --> 02:28:13.551
SO I THINK IT'S WORTH A

02:28:13.618 --> 02:28:15.453
DISCUSSION I'M SURE THE LA- HAS

02:28:15.519 --> 02:28:17.088
THOUGHTS ON THIS AS WELL. AS

02:28:17.154 --> 02:28:18.889
WEATHER 10% IS ENOUGH OR

02:28:18.956 --> 02:28:19.690
WHETHER WE SHOULD BE PUTTING

02:28:19.757 --> 02:28:21.292
MONEY IN OTHER PLACES OF COURSE

02:28:21.359 --> 02:28:22.960
LAST YEAR. WE PUT MONEY IN THE

02:28:23.027 --> 02:28:23.894
SAFETY NET RESERVE WHICH IS

02:28:23.961 --> 02:28:25.896
SEPARATE FROM THE BSA. BUT IT

02:28:25.963 --> 02:28:27.898
IS WORTH NOTING THAT THE VOTERS

02:28:27.965 --> 02:28:30.268
APPROVED AT THE ESSAY- WITH THE

02:28:30.334 --> 02:28:31.636
HOPE THAT WOULD BE FILLED UP

02:28:31.702 --> 02:28:33.404
210% AND WE'RE PROJECTING IF

02:28:33.471 --> 02:28:34.805
ALL GOES WELL. IN THE BUDGET

02:28:34.872 --> 02:28:37.675
YEAR PLUS ONE OF TWENTY TWENTY

02:28:37.742 --> 02:28:38.276
ONE TWENTY TWENTY TWO WE WILL

02:28:38.342 --> 02:28:39.510
BE ATTHAT 10% LEVEL FOR

02:28:39.577 --> 02:28:41.345
MANDATORY DEPOSITS. AND SPEAKER

02:28:41.412 --> 02:28:42.880
THE BSA TO THE YOU THINK IT'S

02:28:42.947 --> 02:28:46.617
APPROPRIATE- THAT WE SHOULD

02:28:46.684 --> 02:28:48.452
CONTINUE TO GROW THE RESEARCH.

02:28:48.519 --> 02:28:50.354
DEFINITELY EITHER THROUGH VIA.

02:28:50.421 --> 02:28:51.489
LIKE THE SAFETY NET RESERVE

02:28:51.555 --> 02:28:53.324
DEPOSITS ME TOO SO TO USE THE

02:28:53.391 --> 02:28:54.525
BSA PROCESS IS THE PROPER THING

02:28:54.592 --> 02:28:56.227
TO DO. SO THERE ARE DIFFERENT

02:28:56.294 --> 02:28:57.728
RESERVES ACCOUNTS INCLUDING THE

02:28:57.795 --> 02:28:59.163
SAFETY NET RESERVE VENDORS ALSO

02:28:59.230 --> 02:29:00.197
THE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM

02:29:00.264 --> 02:29:01.766
RESERVE- SO I THINK THAT'S A

02:29:01.832 --> 02:29:03.634
DISCUSSION- WE DEFINITELY. YOU

02:29:03.701 --> 02:29:04.935
KNOW WOULD BE INTERESTED AND IN

02:29:05.002 --> 02:29:06.570
TERMS OF. IF WE WANT TO BUILD

02:29:06.637 --> 02:29:07.872
ADDITIONAL DESERVES WHAT WE

02:29:07.938 --> 02:29:09.273
HAVE. RESERVES BEYOND WHAT WE

02:29:09.340 --> 02:29:11.409
HAVE. HOW TO DO THAT- I THINK

02:29:11.475 --> 02:29:12.777
IN AN ENVIRONMENT OF SLOWING

02:29:12.843 --> 02:29:14.178
GROWTH AT THAT THAT DOES

02:29:14.245 --> 02:29:16.247
ACTUALLY COME TO PASS- MOST OF

02:29:16.314 --> 02:29:18.282
ANY AVAILABLE MONEY- MAY BE

02:29:18.349 --> 02:29:19.483
ALLOCATED TO DISCRETIONARY

02:29:19.550 --> 02:29:21.619
PROGRAMS RATHER THAN RESERVES-

02:29:21.686 --> 02:29:22.553
BUT- YOU KNOW SHOULD THERE BE

02:29:22.620 --> 02:29:23.921
ADDITIONAL REVENUES WE WILL

02:29:23.988 --> 02:29:26.624
CONTINUE TO LOOK AT WAYS TO

02:29:26.691 --> 02:29:27.091
CONTINUE TO BUILD OUR

02:29:27.158 --> 02:29:31.228
RESILIENCY. YES I AM FROM FROM

02:29:31.295 --> 02:29:33.197
OUR PERSPECTIVE. WE THINK THIS

02:29:33.264 --> 02:29:34.699
IS ONE OF THE KEY QUESTIONS FOR

02:29:34.765 --> 02:29:36.767
THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER.

02:29:36.834 --> 02:29:38.269
THAT ALMOST AS IF YOU KNOW THE

02:29:38.336 --> 02:29:39.837
FIRST QUESTION BEFORE IT MIGHT

02:29:39.904 --> 02:29:41.005
BE YOU KNOW WHETHER IT IS

02:29:41.072 --> 02:29:42.640
COMFORTABLE WITH. THE LEVEL OF

02:29:42.707 --> 02:29:44.875
DISCRETIONARY RESERVES AND-

02:29:44.942 --> 02:29:46.177
JUST MAKING NOTE I AM ME AND

02:29:46.243 --> 02:29:47.545
MENTIONED IT A LITTLE BIT AGO

02:29:47.611 --> 02:29:49.113
BUT- JUST MAKING NOTE THAT

02:29:49.180 --> 02:29:50.881
RECENT BUDGETS HAVE TAKEN PART

02:29:50.948 --> 02:29:52.783
OF THE SURPLUS AND USED IT TO

02:29:52.850 --> 02:29:54.352
BUILD UP LARGER STE-

02:29:54.418 --> 02:29:56.087
DISCRETIONARY RESERVE SUCH AS

02:29:56.153 --> 02:29:57.888
THE SAFETY NET RESERVE. AND

02:29:57.955 --> 02:30:00.057
THAT THOSE WOULD BE- AT. THE

02:30:00.124 --> 02:30:01.525
ALTERNATIVES THE YOU COULD

02:30:01.592 --> 02:30:02.993
CONSIDER AND- AND WOULD

02:30:03.060 --> 02:30:05.596
CERTAINLY- IT ADD TO THE

02:30:05.663 --> 02:30:07.865
STATE'S BUDGET RESILIENCE. BUT

02:30:07.932 --> 02:30:11.535
AGAIN- YOU KNOW. IF THE IF THAT

02:30:11.602 --> 02:30:12.870
WASN'T THE CHOICE THAN WE THINK

02:30:12.937 --> 02:30:14.638
YOU SHOULD ALSO CONSIDER.

02:30:14.705 --> 02:30:16.040
MAINTAINING SOME DEGREE OF

02:30:16.107 --> 02:30:18.509
OPERATINGSURPLUS- IN THE IN

02:30:18.576 --> 02:30:20.678
THE MULTI YEAR PLAN- IT MAY BE

02:30:20.745 --> 02:30:21.946
SOMEWHAT LARGER THAN WHAT THE

02:30:22.012 --> 02:30:23.347
GOVERNOR PROPOSES BECAUSE THAT

02:30:23.414 --> 02:30:24.582
WOULD HAVE KIND OF THE SIMILAR

02:30:24.648 --> 02:30:25.983
EFFECT. IN A WAY YOU COULD

02:30:26.050 --> 02:30:28.018
THINK OF THE- OPERATING

02:30:28.085 --> 02:30:29.620
SURPLUSES KIND OF YOUR FIRST

02:30:29.687 --> 02:30:31.389
LINE OF DEFENSE AGAINST THE

02:30:31.455 --> 02:30:32.923
EFFECTS OF A RECESSION IT WOULD

02:30:32.990 --> 02:30:34.792
BE THE FIRST THING TO ABSORB.

02:30:34.859 --> 02:30:36.794
THE SHORTFALL SO THAT WOULD BE

02:30:36.861 --> 02:30:37.895
ONE ALTERNATIVE IF YOU DIDN'T

02:30:37.962 --> 02:30:41.799
WANT TO USE YOU KNOW MAKE A- A

02:30:41.866 --> 02:30:47.571
DISCRETE DEPOSIT. LAST FOR ME.

02:30:47.638 --> 02:30:49.407
MY COLLEAGUES DELF QUITE DEEPLY

02:30:49.473 --> 02:30:51.041
INTO MANY THE SPENDING PROPOSAL

02:30:51.108 --> 02:30:53.811
SO I WILL JUST. ASK ONE

02:30:53.878 --> 02:30:56.147
QUESTION ONE IS REALLY KIND OF

02:30:56.213 --> 02:30:59.417
PROCEDURAL. WE'RE CLEAR THAT A

02:30:59.483 --> 02:31:01.218
NUMBER OF YOUR PROPOSALS WILL

02:31:01.285 --> 02:31:03.888
REQUIRE STATUTORY CHANGES.

02:31:03.954 --> 02:31:04.755
THREE ONE OF THE LEGISLATURE BE

02:31:04.822 --> 02:31:06.490
RECEIVING TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE

02:31:06.557 --> 02:31:07.491
FOR ALL YOUR PROPOSALS IN

02:31:07.558 --> 02:31:09.827
FEBRUARY IF NOT IF YOU COULD

02:31:09.894 --> 02:31:11.429
LET US KNOW WHEN WE CAN EXPECT

02:31:11.495 --> 02:31:12.930
TO GET THAT LANGUAGE BECAUSE

02:31:12.997 --> 02:31:16.400
IT'S ME THE STUFF IT'S NOT JUST

02:31:16.467 --> 02:31:17.134
DOLLARS AND SUSAN COLLINS IT'S

02:31:17.201 --> 02:31:19.870
REAL. STATUTORY WE'LL HAVE THAT

02:31:19.937 --> 02:31:21.305
STORY IMPACTS WE WANT TO MAKE

02:31:21.372 --> 02:31:22.640
SURE WE HAVE ENOUGH TIME TO

02:31:22.706 --> 02:31:24.675
PROCESS ALL OF THAT FLOWS

02:31:24.742 --> 02:31:27.011
FEBRUARY REASONABLE OR NOT YES

02:31:27.077 --> 02:31:28.813
SO WE'RE TRYING TO GET AS MANY

02:31:28.879 --> 02:31:30.681
OF OUR PROPOSALS AT RELEASED ON

02:31:30.748 --> 02:31:32.283
FEBRUARY FIRST AS POSSIBLE AND

02:31:32.349 --> 02:31:33.451
YOU I'M SURE AT THE CONCLUSION

02:31:33.517 --> 02:31:34.285
OF THE HEARING MY COLLEAGUES

02:31:34.351 --> 02:31:35.319
AND I WERE ALL GONNA RUN BACK

02:31:35.386 --> 02:31:36.720
TO FINANCE AND- CONTINUE

02:31:36.787 --> 02:31:38.189
PLUGGING AWAY ON THAT. THERE

02:31:38.255 --> 02:31:40.458
ARE CERTAIN NUMBER PROPOSALS-

02:31:40.524 --> 02:31:41.792
INCLUDING SOME OF THAT VERY NEW

02:31:41.859 --> 02:31:43.060
CONCEPTS OF THE GOVERNOR HAS

02:31:43.127 --> 02:31:45.362
PROPOSED WHERE WE HAVE- WE DO

02:31:45.429 --> 02:31:47.131
NEED ADDITIONAL TIME- AND WHAT

02:31:47.198 --> 02:31:48.232
LOOKING MORE TOWARD A SPRING

02:31:48.299 --> 02:31:49.533
RELEASE OF THAT LANGUAGE IN THE

02:31:49.600 --> 02:31:50.968
PROPOSAL BUT WE'RE VERY

02:31:51.035 --> 02:31:52.169
COGNIZANT OF THE FACT THAT THE

02:31:52.236 --> 02:31:53.103
WAY TO RE RELEASE THOSE

02:31:53.170 --> 02:31:54.505
PROPOSALS THE LAST TIME THE

02:31:54.572 --> 02:31:55.873
LEGISLATURE HAS TO CONSIDER

02:31:55.940 --> 02:31:57.475
THEM- SO WE ARE WORKING TO GET

02:31:57.541 --> 02:31:58.509
THEM OUT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE

02:31:58.576 --> 02:31:59.410
AND WE WILL BE IN TOUCH WITH

02:31:59.477 --> 02:32:01.846
BUDGET STAFF ON THE- SPRING AS

02:32:01.912 --> 02:32:04.348
IN PRE MAY REVISE. PULSE MAY

02:32:04.415 --> 02:32:09.420
REVISE EARLY SPRING. WHERE ARE

02:32:09.487 --> 02:32:10.688
YOU. OR YOU BUT YOU KNOW IT'S

02:32:10.754 --> 02:32:11.655
HARD TO SEE. PROPOSALS COMING

02:32:11.722 --> 02:32:12.923
OUT MAY REFER. DOING A BUDGET

02:32:12.990 --> 02:32:14.058
WINDOW BUT S. WE'LL BE IN CLOSE

02:32:14.124 --> 02:32:15.659
TOUCH INTO OKAY WE'RE IN THE

02:32:15.726 --> 02:32:16.560
PROCESS OF THE TIME WHEN THOSE

02:32:16.627 --> 02:32:18.596
WILL BE. ONE MORE QUESTION- FOR

02:32:18.662 --> 02:32:20.064
ME ON SPIN PROPOSALS THERE ARE

02:32:20.130 --> 02:32:21.465
A NUMBER OF PROPOSALS FOR NEW

02:32:21.532 --> 02:32:22.967
DEPARTMENT TORE

02:32:23.033 --> 02:32:25.536
REORGANIZATIONS OR NEW NAMES I

02:32:25.603 --> 02:32:28.072
THINK. MY BONE OF CONTENTION IS

02:32:28.138 --> 02:32:32.576
THE NEW NAMES. BECAUSE BECAUSE

02:32:32.643 --> 02:32:34.178
IT JUST RENAME THE DEPARTMENT

02:32:34.245 --> 02:32:35.746
DOESN'T NECESSARILY YOU KNOW

02:32:35.813 --> 02:32:37.648
CANNELLA CULTURE SHIFT. I DON'T

02:32:37.715 --> 02:32:38.115
THINK THE NAME OF THE

02:32:38.182 --> 02:32:39.750
DEPARTMENT NECESSARILY ASK THE

02:32:39.817 --> 02:32:42.052
YOU KNOW. REFLECT WHAT EVER

02:32:42.119 --> 02:32:44.388
ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGES THAT

02:32:44.455 --> 02:32:45.823
THE- ADMINISTRATION SEEMS

02:32:45.890 --> 02:32:47.591
APPROPRIATE AND SO WHAT'S THE
