DATA PRIVACY PROTECTION

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:18.918
EXPLORING THE CALIFORNIA

00:00:18.985 --> 00:00:21.121
CONSUMER PRIVACY ACT AND ITS

00:00:21.187 --> 00:00:22.722
EUROPEAN COUNTERPART.

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:25.558
KNOWN AS GDP ARE AND I SHOULD

00:00:25.625 --> 00:00:26.993
REMEMBER WHAT THAT STANDS FOR

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.528
BUT AT THE MOMENT IT IS ESCAPING

00:00:28.595 --> 00:00:30.130
ME IT IS THE EUROPEAN

00:00:30.196 --> 00:00:34.000
COUNTERPART TO OUR THE CC PA

00:00:34.067 --> 00:00:37.103
WHICH SET THE WAY TO START

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.471
ADDRESSING THE WHOLE ISSUE OF

00:00:38.538 --> 00:00:39.839
DATA PRIVACY.

00:00:39.906 --> 00:00:42.342
AND HOW CRITICALLY IMPORTANT IT

00:00:42.409 --> 00:00:44.511
IS HERE IN CALIFORNIA --

00:00:44.577 --> 00:00:47.013
AS WELL AS I THINK THE NATION AS

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:48.648
THEY LOOK TO CALIFORNIA WE ARE.

00:00:48.715 --> 00:00:50.683
OFTEN REFERRED TO AS THE STATE

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:53.386
THAT SHOWS WHAT IS POSSIBLE AND

00:00:53.453 --> 00:00:54.788
HOPEFULLY IN THIS ONE WE'RE

00:00:54.854 --> 00:00:55.889
&lt;c.magenta&gt;EADING THE WAY I KNOW THERE ARE&lt;/c&gt;

00:00:55.955 --> 00:00:57.357
SEVERAL OTHER STATES ACTUALLY

00:00:57.424 --> 00:00:58.525
THAT HAVE.

00:00:58.591 --> 00:01:01.127
IN FACT TAKEN THE MODEL AND ARE

00:01:01.194 --> 00:01:02.996
USING IT AS A TEMPLATE. FOR

00:01:03.062 --> 00:01:04.664
THEIR EFFORTS TO TRY TO ADDRESS

00:01:04.731 --> 00:01:05.932
THIS PROBLEM --

00:01:05.999 --> 00:01:07.567
THERE ARE SEVERAL MEMBERS OF OUR

00:01:07.634 --> 00:01:10.303
COMMITTEE WHO ARE HOPING TO

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:11.638
ATTEND WE DO HAVE.

00:01:11.704 --> 00:01:14.107
OUR VICE CHAIR WITH US TODAY AND

00:01:14.174 --> 00:01:15.909
A SENATOR MONEY JUST WALKED IN

00:01:15.975 --> 00:01:16.676
THERE SHOULD BE MORE PEOPLE

00:01:16.743 --> 00:01:20.780
COMING -- WE

00:01:20.847 --> 00:01:23.183
HAVE A ROBUST FOR ANY OUR

00:01:23.249 --> 00:01:24.684
INTEREST [inaudible]

00:01:24.751 --> 00:01:28.988

00:01:29.055 --> 00:01:32.492
BUT AN IMPORTANT TO READ CAUGHT.

00:01:32.559 --> 00:01:32.692
DONE.

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.127
DEALING WITH THE CURRENT STATE

00:01:34.194 --> 00:01:36.863
OF OUR DATA PRIVACY PROTECTION A

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.565
WONDERFUL COMPARISON.

00:01:38.631 --> 00:01:40.700
OF BETWEEN THE CCPA AND THE G.

00:01:40.767 --> 00:01:43.203

WEBSITE AND I COMMENDED TO YOU

00:01:47.273 --> 00:01:49.142
IT'S NOT BAD TIME READING PER SE

00:01:49.209 --> 00:01:51.277
BUT IT'S SO IMPORTANT READING

00:01:51.344 --> 00:01:53.146
THAT WILL GIVE YOU I THINK SOME

00:01:53.213 --> 00:01:54.647
VERY VERY HELPFUL BACKGROUND.

00:01:54.714 --> 00:01:56.349
AND UNDERSTANDING OF THE LAWS

00:01:56.416 --> 00:01:58.117
THAT EXISTS IN SOME OF THE

00:01:58.184 --> 00:01:59.352
ISSUES THAT WE WILL BE.

00:01:59.419 --> 00:02:02.755
DISCUSSING AT SOME LENGTH HERE

00:02:02.822 --> 00:02:04.724
THIS AFTERNOON.

00:02:04.791 --> 00:02:06.092
WELL YOU KNOW I WAS I WAS

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:07.360
THINKING WHO WAS HIT IN THE

00:02:07.427 --> 00:02:09.829
CONGRESS WHO WAS THE TAX

00:02:09.896 --> 00:02:11.631
SPECIALIST THE OF GOD HIMSELF

00:02:11.698 --> 00:02:13.199
LITTLE TROUBLE JUMPING INTO ONE

00:02:13.266 --> 00:02:14.934
OF THE PAWNS IN WASHINGTON SEE

00:02:15.001 --> 00:02:15.535
MILLS.

00:02:15.602 --> 00:02:17.170
WAS IN NAME WHO CLAIMED THAT HE

00:02:17.237 --> 00:02:19.806
READ THE TAX CODE IN THE EVENING

00:02:19.873 --> 00:02:21.841
BEFORE BED TIME AND THAT ALWAYS

00:02:21.908 --> 00:02:24.077
MADE ME WONDER JUST HOW MUCH FOR

00:02:24.143 --> 00:02:24.944
IT HE COULD READ.

00:02:25.011 --> 00:02:26.045
OF WHEN --

00:02:26.112 --> 00:02:27.280
SOME OF IT IS KIND OF

00:02:27.347 --> 00:02:29.616
COMPLICATED AS THIS ISSUE IS BUT

00:02:29.682 --> 00:02:31.384
IT'S AN IMPORTANT ISSUE AND ONE

00:02:31.451 --> 00:02:32.719
THAT HOPEFULLY.

00:02:32.785 --> 00:02:34.487
WE WILL BE ABLE TO ADDRESS

00:02:34.554 --> 00:02:37.991
THOUGHTFULLY SO WITH THAT I'M A

00:02:38.057 --> 00:02:40.326
GRATEFUL TO ALL WHO ARE HERE

00:02:40.393 --> 00:02:41.728
TODAY AND THIS IS ALSO.

00:02:41.794 --> 00:02:44.130
BEING PRESENTED ON LINE IS I

00:02:44.197 --> 00:02:45.865
MENTION IT'S AN INFORMATIONAL

00:02:45.932 --> 00:02:49.168
HEARING AND IT'S ONE THAT I

00:02:49.235 --> 00:02:50.703
THINK WILL BE HELPFUL TO US IN

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:52.071
THE FUTURE IS AMANDA HERE BY THE

00:02:52.138 --> 00:02:53.540
WAY.

00:02:53.606 --> 00:02:55.041
OUR ONE INTRODUCE AMANDA

00:02:55.108 --> 00:02:57.176
MATCHING SHE'S JUST RECENTLY

00:02:57.243 --> 00:02:58.678
JOINED OUR COMMITTEE --

00:02:58.745 --> 00:03:01.080
AS COUNSEL WELCOME AMANDA WE

00:03:01.147 --> 00:03:02.482
LOOK FORWARD TO SOME.

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:04.217
OF VERY INTERESTING CHALLENGES

00:03:04.284 --> 00:03:06.052
GOING FORWARD THIS YEAR.

00:03:06.119 --> 00:03:09.322
AND OF WHAT I'D LIKE TO DO IS

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:11.224
JUST MAKE A FEW OPENING REMARKS

00:03:11.291 --> 00:03:13.192
AND ASK OTHERS IF THEY'D LIKE TO

00:03:13.259 --> 00:03:14.761
MAKE SOME AS WELL AND THEN GET

00:03:14.827 --> 00:03:15.528
STARTED.

00:03:15.595 --> 00:03:17.063
WE WILL HAVE A AS I MENTIONED

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:19.566
SOME ROBUST DISCUSSIONS AND THEN

00:03:19.632 --> 00:03:21.968
WE WILL AT THE END OFFER A

00:03:22.035 --> 00:03:23.703
PUBLIC COMMENT TWO MINUTES EACH

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:25.038
PLEASE WITH YOUR NAME AND

00:03:25.104 --> 00:03:26.172
AFFILIATION.

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:28.207
OF BEING PROVIDED AT THE FRONT

00:03:28.274 --> 00:03:32.979
END OF YOUR REMARKS SO WITH THAT --

00:03:33.046 --> 00:03:36.149
I WANT TO THANK THANK THE STAFF

00:03:36.215 --> 00:03:37.717
AGAIN FOR AN EXCELLENT --

00:03:37.784 --> 00:03:39.819
SERIES OF DOCUMENTS THAT WILL BE

00:03:39.886 --> 00:03:41.354
HELPFUL IN PUTTING TOGETHER WHAT

00:03:41.421 --> 00:03:43.222
I THINK IS A VERY.

00:03:43.289 --> 00:03:45.725
THOROUGH AN EXCITING PANEL --

00:03:45.792 --> 00:03:47.293
THIS IS AN IMPORTANT ISSUE AND

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.662
NOT A NEW ISSUE FOR MANY OF US

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:51.431
PRIVACY AND CONSUMER PROTECTION

00:03:51.497 --> 00:03:53.066
OF ALWAYS BEEN VERY IMPORTANT TO

00:03:53.132 --> 00:03:55.068
ME -- I

00:03:55.134 --> 00:03:56.636
THINK IT'S AFTER I READ THE BOOK.

00:03:56.703 --> 00:03:59.372
BRAVE NEW WORLD AND THE IMAGE OF

00:03:59.439 --> 00:04:02.609
A BIG TV SCREEN ON THE WALL IF

00:04:02.675 --> 00:04:05.011
ANY OF YOU HAVE READ THE BOOK --

00:04:05.078 --> 00:04:07.213
IF THERE IS BIG BROTHER WHO IS

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:08.648
WATCHING YOU.

00:04:08.715 --> 00:04:11.317
RATHER THAN YOU WATCHING THE TV

00:04:11.384 --> 00:04:13.419
AND IN MANY RESPECTS THE THIS

00:04:13.486 --> 00:04:16.022
WHOLE ISSUE OF DATA PRIVACY

00:04:16.089 --> 00:04:17.423
REALLY DOES HAVE.

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:19.626
AS PART OF ITS CONSEQUENCE WHO

00:04:19.692 --> 00:04:21.728
IS WATCHING US AND WHAT IS THE

00:04:21.794 --> 00:04:22.962
INFORMATION THEY'RE COLLECTING

00:04:23.029 --> 00:04:24.797
NOW IT MAY NOT BE THE GOVERNMENT

00:04:24.864 --> 00:04:25.765
OR IT MAY.

00:04:25.832 --> 00:04:27.266
BUT CERTAINLY WE DO KNOW THAT

00:04:27.333 --> 00:04:29.035
THE PRIVATE SECTOR THROUGH THE

00:04:29.102 --> 00:04:31.738
TECHNOLOGIES THAT EXIST TODAY.

00:04:31.804 --> 00:04:35.208
HAVE REALLY TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF

00:04:35.274 --> 00:04:38.077
INTO OUR HOMES INTO OUR LIVES --

00:04:38.144 --> 00:04:40.580
AND OBTAIN INFORMATION THAT MANY

00:04:40.647 --> 00:04:42.315
OF US DON'T EVEN KNOW IS BEING

00:04:42.382 --> 00:04:43.850
TAKEN.

00:04:43.916 --> 00:04:45.818
AND USING IT OR SELLING IT OR

00:04:45.885 --> 00:04:47.353
DOING THINGS WITH IT THAT WE'RE

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:49.222
NOT AWARE OFF AND SO PART OF I

00:04:49.288 --> 00:04:50.857
THINK THE CHALLENGE HAS BEEN THE

00:04:50.923 --> 00:04:52.158
PUBLIC DOESN'T REALLY KNOW.

00:04:52.225 --> 00:04:54.594
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU GO ON TO

00:04:54.661 --> 00:04:56.295
THE INTERNET OR --

00:04:56.362 --> 00:04:58.631
YOU BY A CERTAIN PRODUCT --

00:04:58.698 --> 00:05:00.366
OR SOMETHING THAT IS

00:05:00.433 --> 00:05:02.602
IDENTIFIABLE TO YOU OR PRODUCT

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:03.770
THE PEOPLE MIGHT AT SOME POINT

00:05:03.836 --> 00:05:05.371
WANT TO SELL YOU OR INFORMATION

00:05:05.438 --> 00:05:06.873
ABOUT YOUR POLITICAL

00:05:06.939 --> 00:05:08.374
PERSPECTIVES THAT THEY MIGHT

00:05:08.441 --> 00:05:10.209
WANNA USED TO THEIR OWN

00:05:10.276 --> 00:05:12.178
ADVANTAGE I THINK OF CAMBRIDGE

00:05:12.245 --> 00:05:13.913
ANALYTICA AS AN EXAMPLE WHERE

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:15.148
WE'VE LEARNED THAT.

00:05:15.214 --> 00:05:17.417
IN FACT OUR OF ELECTION

00:05:17.483 --> 00:05:19.318
DECISIONS FOR AMONG THE MOST

00:05:19.385 --> 00:05:20.920
PERSONAL DECISIONS WE MAKE WE'RE

00:05:20.987 --> 00:05:22.922
BEING MANIPULATED AS A RESULT OF

00:05:22.989 --> 00:05:25.191
INFORMATION BEING OBTAINED

00:05:25.258 --> 00:05:27.860
WITHOUT OUR KNOWLEDGE.

00:05:27.927 --> 00:05:29.062
OR PERMISSION OR CONSENT.

00:05:29.128 --> 00:05:31.731
SO CALIFORNIA UNLIKE MANY OTHER

00:05:31.798 --> 00:05:33.332
PLACES IN CERTAINLY UNLIKE OUR

00:05:33.399 --> 00:05:34.934
FEDERAL CONSTITUTION WE HAVE A

00:05:35.001 --> 00:05:36.569
RIGHT TO PRIVACY.

00:05:36.636 --> 00:05:37.737
THAT IS BUILT RIGHT INTO OUR

00:05:37.804 --> 00:05:40.106
CONSTITUTION AND IT HAPPENED

00:05:40.173 --> 00:05:41.074
IRONICALLY WE DID A LITTLE

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:42.975
RESEARCH ON THIS ABOUT FORTY

00:05:43.042 --> 00:05:44.410
YEARS AGO.

00:05:44.477 --> 00:05:46.612
THEN ASSEMBLY MEMBER THE THEN

00:05:46.679 --> 00:05:49.015
MAYOR OF SAN FRANCISCO AND THE

00:05:49.082 --> 00:05:52.218
VICTIM OF AN ASSASSINATION WAS

00:05:52.285 --> 00:05:53.786
THE MAYOR GEORGE MOSCONI.

00:05:53.853 --> 00:05:55.521
AND BACK FORTY YEARS AGO HE

00:05:55.588 --> 00:05:58.791
REALIZED THAT THE TECHNOLOGIES

00:05:58.858 --> 00:06:00.059
THAT WERE BEING DEVELOPED MIGHT

00:06:00.126 --> 00:06:02.295
VERY WELL IMPACT OUR PERSONAL

00:06:02.361 --> 00:06:05.331
PRIVACY AND AS A RESULT --

00:06:05.398 --> 00:06:06.599
WAS THE MOVING FORCE.

00:06:06.666 --> 00:06:09.035
ON A BALLOT INITIATIVE THAT

00:06:09.102 --> 00:06:11.270
PASSED DO WE KNOW THE NUMBERS

00:06:11.337 --> 00:06:12.705
HOW OVERWHELMINGLY PASSED.

00:06:12.772 --> 00:06:14.874
WELL REGARDLESS IT PASSED THE

00:06:14.941 --> 00:06:16.375
PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA PASSED AN

00:06:16.442 --> 00:06:18.978
INITIATIVE THAT PUT PRIVACY AS A

00:06:19.045 --> 00:06:20.179
FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT.

00:06:20.246 --> 00:06:22.415
THAT EXIST RIGHT WITHIN OUR

00:06:22.482 --> 00:06:24.617
STATE'S CONSTITUTION.

00:06:24.684 --> 00:06:26.018
BUT DESPITE ITS STATUS AS A

00:06:26.085 --> 00:06:28.888
FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT FACT BEEN

00:06:28.955 --> 00:06:31.357
UNDER ATTACK AND AS I MENTIONED

00:06:31.424 --> 00:06:33.025
THE AND CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA

00:06:33.092 --> 00:06:36.062
SCANDAL AMONG OTHERS PROVE THAT.

00:06:36.129 --> 00:06:38.030
WE HAVE LOST A LOT OF OUR

00:06:38.097 --> 00:06:40.867
PRIVACY AND WANT TO TAKE IT BACK

00:06:40.933 --> 00:06:42.769
AND LAST YEAR WE TOOK OUR FIRST

00:06:42.835 --> 00:06:44.537
STEPS WITH THE CALIFORNIA

00:06:44.604 --> 00:06:46.639
CONSUMER PRIVACY ACT AS A RESULT

00:06:46.706 --> 00:06:49.175
OF THE COMMITMENT.

00:06:49.242 --> 00:06:52.111
DETERMINATION AND POCKETBOOK OF

00:06:52.178 --> 00:06:54.213
ONE ALISTAIR MCTAGGART WHO WILL

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:55.915
BE OUR FIRST WITNESS TODAY WHO

00:06:55.982 --> 00:06:58.217
ALSO I THINK SHARE THAT

00:06:58.284 --> 00:07:00.086
CONCERNED ABOUT THE THREATS TO

00:07:00.153 --> 00:07:02.488
OUR DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS AS A

00:07:02.555 --> 00:07:04.257
RESULT OF THIS LACK OF OF THIS

00:07:04.323 --> 00:07:07.126
LOSS OF OUR PRIVACY.

00:07:07.193 --> 00:07:09.195
BUT THE CCPA.

00:07:09.262 --> 00:07:10.563
WAS A GOOD FIRST STEP.

00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:12.098
LIKELY A WITH MORE NEEDING TO BE

00:07:12.165 --> 00:07:14.300
DONE TO BOLSTER ITS PROTECTIONS

00:07:14.367 --> 00:07:17.003
FOR CONSUMERS AND THEIR PRIVACY

00:07:17.069 --> 00:07:19.539
AND THERE ARE MANY OF US I THINK

00:07:19.605 --> 00:07:20.573
THERE'S SOMETHING LIKE FORTY

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:22.041
BILLS THAT HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED

00:07:22.108 --> 00:07:23.109
THIS YEAR.

00:07:23.176 --> 00:07:24.911
ADDRESSING THE C. CPA AND OTHER

00:07:24.977 --> 00:07:27.246
PRIVACY RIGHTS SO I THINK THERE

00:07:27.313 --> 00:07:28.948
ARE OTHERS WHO SHARE.

00:07:29.015 --> 00:07:31.284
MY CONCERN THAT WE NEED TO

00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:33.286
PERHAPS DO MORE WORK BEFORE.

00:07:33.352 --> 00:07:34.554
WE PUT THIS --

00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:37.757
OF THE BILL BEFORE THE PUBLIC.

00:07:37.824 --> 00:07:41.093
IN THE CA IN SO FAR AS IMPLEMENT

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:43.329
TATIAN PERIOD OF TWENTY TWENTY

00:07:43.396 --> 00:07:44.797
SO THERE'S WORK WE CAN DO

00:07:44.864 --> 00:07:46.532
BETWEEN NOW AND THEN --

00:07:46.599 --> 00:07:48.167
AND BASICALLY --

00:07:48.234 --> 00:07:50.736
OUR PRIVACY RIGHTS CANNOT BE

00:07:50.803 --> 00:07:52.638
UNDERMINED IN THE NAME OF

00:07:52.705 --> 00:07:54.540
CORPORATE PROFIT I THINK THAT IS

00:07:54.607 --> 00:07:57.043
A CLEAR VALUE THAT MOST OF US

00:07:57.109 --> 00:07:58.644
HAVE AND CERTAINLY ONE THAT --

00:07:58.711 --> 00:08:00.313
TO WE'RE HOPING TO ADVANCE.

00:08:00.379 --> 00:08:01.781
IN THE YEARS TO COME OFF THE

00:08:01.848 --> 00:08:03.015
GREAT WORK THAT WAS DONE LAST

00:08:03.082 --> 00:08:05.084
YEAR AND THANKS TO MR MCTAGGART

00:08:05.151 --> 00:08:06.886
SO -- THERE

00:08:06.953 --> 00:08:08.688
ARE WE KNOW NUMEROUS GROUPS THAT

00:08:08.754 --> 00:08:12.124
ARE EYEING THIS EFFORT --

00:08:12.191 --> 00:08:13.459
IT WITH AN INTEREST IN DILUTING

00:08:13.526 --> 00:08:15.228
ITS IMPACT I THINK MANY OF US

00:08:15.294 --> 00:08:16.128
HERE.

00:08:16.195 --> 00:08:18.364
BELIEVE THAT WE NEED TO DO MORE

00:08:18.431 --> 00:08:19.298
BUT WE WANT TO DO IT IN A WAY

00:08:19.365 --> 00:08:20.967
THAT'S WORKABLE FOR OUR

00:08:21.033 --> 00:08:22.335
BUSINESSES SO PART OF THE

00:08:22.401 --> 00:08:24.904
DISCUSSION TODAY IS GOING TO BE --

00:08:24.971 --> 00:08:27.406
FINDING OUT FROM PRACTITIONERS --

00:08:27.473 --> 00:08:30.276
EXACTLY HOW THIS BILL CAN BE

00:08:30.343 --> 00:08:33.546
IMPLEMENTED AND HOW THE GDP ARE

00:08:33.613 --> 00:08:35.448
WHICH WAS.

00:08:35.514 --> 00:08:37.683
PERHAPS A MORE ROBUST A EUROPEAN

00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:39.418
MODEL I IS ALREADY BEING

00:08:39.485 --> 00:08:41.020
IMPLEMENTED SO THE NOTION WE

00:08:41.087 --> 00:08:42.521
CAN'T DO THIS BECAUSE IT'LL BLOW

00:08:42.588 --> 00:08:44.724
UP THE THE BUSINESS MODEL I

00:08:44.790 --> 00:08:46.025
THINK IS A SORT OF A FALSE

00:08:46.092 --> 00:08:47.493
NARRATIVE AND ONE THAT I'M

00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:48.394
HOPING WE WILL.

00:08:48.461 --> 00:08:50.496
THE BUNK FAIRLY QUICKLY WE

00:08:50.563 --> 00:08:54.934
REALLY AND WITH THAT --

00:08:55.001 --> 00:08:59.372
I WILL INVITE OTHERS --

00:08:59.438 --> 00:09:02.208
TO MAKE OPENING REMARKS IF THEY

00:09:02.275 --> 00:09:02.842
HAVE A FEW THOUGHTS I'D LIKE TO

00:09:02.909 --> 00:09:05.211
SHARE.

00:09:05.278 --> 00:09:06.312
MISTER VICE CHAIR YOU'RE ALL SET

00:09:06.379 --> 00:09:10.416

THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I WASN'T

00:09:11.717 --> 00:09:13.419
PLANNING ON IT HAVING AN OPENING

00:09:13.486 --> 00:09:15.154
REMARK BUT I WILL SAY --

00:09:15.221 --> 00:09:16.389
THAT.

00:09:16.455 --> 00:09:18.824
DISAPPEARS AT FIRST BLUSH TO BE

00:09:18.891 --> 00:09:20.159
A TERRIBLY COMPLICATED --

00:09:20.226 --> 00:09:21.460
THE LAW --

00:09:21.527 --> 00:09:24.797
ONE THEN I AM EXPOSING MYSELF TO

00:09:24.864 --> 00:09:27.066
IN TRYING TO LEARN AS MUCH ABOUT --

00:09:27.133 --> 00:09:28.634
I HAD A COMMUNITY MEETING IN MY

00:09:28.701 --> 00:09:30.202
FORMER CAPACITY IS A COUNTY

00:09:30.269 --> 00:09:31.904
SUPERVISOR.

00:09:31.971 --> 00:09:34.106
WHERE WE HAD --

00:09:34.173 --> 00:09:35.508
IT WAS ORIENTED TOWARDS SENIORS

00:09:35.574 --> 00:09:38.511
HOW TO AVOID SENIOR SCAMS.

00:09:38.577 --> 00:09:40.446
AND THAT KIND OF BROUGHT TO THE

00:09:40.513 --> 00:09:42.315
FORE -- HOW

00:09:42.381 --> 00:09:43.916
INFORMATION CAN BE?

00:09:43.983 --> 00:09:44.750
PUT OUT IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN IN

00:09:44.817 --> 00:09:47.386
BY THOSE --

00:09:47.453 --> 00:09:51.257
ULTERIOR MOTIVES CAN BE USED TO

00:09:51.324 --> 00:09:52.224
HASSLE IN MISLEAD.

00:09:52.291 --> 00:09:53.859
VULNERABLE PORTIONS OF OUR

00:09:53.926 --> 00:09:56.262
COMMUNITY IN THIS CASE SENIORS.

00:09:56.329 --> 00:09:58.164
AND THAT KIND OF GOT ME THINKING

00:09:58.230 --> 00:10:00.633
ABOUT WHAT IS OUT THERE.

00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:02.768
I'D LIKE TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT

00:10:02.835 --> 00:10:05.304
THERE IS IN IMPLEMENTATION THAT

00:10:05.371 --> 00:10:07.073
IS BALANCED AS YOU MENTION MADAM

00:10:07.139 --> 00:10:08.140
CHAIR --

00:10:08.207 --> 00:10:10.376

00:10:10.443 --> 00:10:12.078
THAT IS LOOKING AFTER ARE

00:10:12.144 --> 00:10:13.612
CONSTITUTIONALLY PROTECTED

00:10:13.679 --> 00:10:15.548

ECONOMY --

00:10:24.724 --> 00:10:26.392
THAT HURTS IS COMPETITIVELY SO I

00:10:26.459 --> 00:10:27.927
THINK LIKE ANYTHING ELSE IS THE

00:10:27.994 --> 00:10:29.295
BALANCE I AND I THINK THAT

00:10:29.362 --> 00:10:32.431
APPROACH IS ALWAYS A HEALTHY --

00:10:32.498 --> 00:10:34.934
ONE BUT I WOULD --

00:10:35.001 --> 00:10:38.637

00:10:59.058 --> 00:10:59.992
AND I HAD TO GO THROUGH THE

00:11:00.059 --> 00:11:01.861
LABORIOUS PROCESS OF GETTING IT

00:11:01.927 --> 00:11:02.862

00:11:02.928 --> 00:11:05.297

IF YOU ARE A FAST FOOD

00:14:08.214 --> 00:14:09.648
RESTAURANT IF YOU.

00:14:09.715 --> 00:14:10.583
WHAT TIME YOU TO WORK WHAT TIME

00:14:10.649 --> 00:14:11.884
YOU LEAVE UP AND AS IT YOU KNOW

00:14:11.951 --> 00:14:13.018
THIS INFORMATION HAS A

00:14:13.085 --> 00:14:14.620
TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF VALUE?

00:14:14.687 --> 00:14:15.788
AS I LIKE TO SAY YOU KNOW A

00:14:15.854 --> 00:14:16.689
HUNDRED YEARS AGO STANDARD AWAY

SO WHAT WITH THE TIME LINE I GOT

00:14:26.665 --> 00:14:27.733
THIS IDEA AROUND THE END OF

00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:29.168
TWENTY FIFTEEN I SPENT TWO YEARS.

00:14:29.235 --> 00:14:31.303
RESEARCHING IT TALKING TO AS

00:14:31.370 --> 00:14:32.471
MANY EXPERTS --

00:14:32.538 --> 00:14:34.173
IN ACADEMIA ADVOCATES IN

00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:36.342
BUSINESSES LIKE COULD --

00:14:36.408 --> 00:14:37.243
THAT RESULTED IN FILING THE

00:14:37.309 --> 00:14:38.377
INITIATIVE --

00:14:38.444 --> 00:14:40.246
IN NOVEMBER OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN

00:14:40.312 --> 00:14:40.913
AND CERTAIN TO GATHER SIGNATURES

00:14:40.980 --> 00:14:44.416
AT THE BEGINNING OF LAW.

00:14:44.483 --> 00:14:46.518
THROUGH APRIL IN JUNE I START

00:14:46.585 --> 00:14:48.487
HAVE NEGOTIATIONS WITH THIS BODY.

00:14:48.554 --> 00:14:50.122
PRIMARILY WITH SENATOR HERTZBERG

00:14:50.189 --> 00:14:51.790
AN ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHAO.

00:14:51.857 --> 00:14:53.192
THOUGH EVENTUALLY.

00:14:53.259 --> 00:14:54.493
YOU KNOW IT TOOK A LOT OF PEOPLE

00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:55.594
AND IT IT TOOK A LOT OF

00:14:55.661 --> 00:14:57.229
ASSISTANCE THAT WOULD HAVE.

00:14:57.296 --> 00:14:58.530
HAPPENED I THINK IF OF IF THE

00:14:58.597 --> 00:14:59.431
CHAIR HAD NOT BEEN GRACIOUS

00:14:59.498 --> 00:15:01.734
ENOUGH TO PUT HER WEIGHT BEHIND

00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:03.669
IT AS WELL --

00:15:03.736 --> 00:15:05.804
YOU KNOW AS I THINK ABOUT IT

00:15:05.871 --> 00:15:07.973
IT'S YOU KNOW WHAT ONE OF THE

00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:08.674
THINGS TO THINK ABOUT IS WHEN WE

00:15:08.741 --> 00:15:09.842
WERE GATHERED SIGNATURES WE

00:15:09.908 --> 00:15:10.976
ENDED UP COLLECTING MORE

00:15:11.043 --> 00:15:12.511
SIGNATURES THAN PEOPLE LIVE IN

00:15:12.578 --> 00:15:14.179
EITHER VERMONT OR WYOMING THIS

00:15:14.246 --> 00:15:15.581
IS A VERY POPULAR.

00:15:15.648 --> 00:15:17.216
ISSUE WE NEVER PULLED BELOW 80%

00:15:17.283 --> 00:15:18.984
CALIFORNIA'S REALLY CARE ABOUT

00:15:19.051 --> 00:15:20.619
THEIR PRIVACY.

00:15:20.686 --> 00:15:21.687
THERE WAS THE OPPOSITION

00:15:21.754 --> 00:15:22.521
COMMITTEE FORMED AND I JUST PUT

00:15:22.588 --> 00:15:23.555
THIS UP TO STE I DO THINK IT'S

00:15:23.622 --> 00:15:25.424
AN AMAZING AMERICAN STORY YOU

00:15:25.491 --> 00:15:28.093
KNOW THE AMOUNT OF MONEY RAISED

00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:29.662
TO GET AGAINST US BETWEEN THE

00:15:29.728 --> 00:15:30.796
THE COMPANIES THAT CONTRIBUTED

00:15:30.863 --> 00:15:33.132
DIRECTLY. TO US THE DAY GET TO

00:15:33.198 --> 00:15:33.966
THE COMMITTEE AGAINST US.

00:15:34.033 --> 00:15:36.035
AND REPRESENTING THE THE

00:15:36.101 --> 00:15:37.503
ASSOCIATION SERVES OVER SIX

00:15:37.569 --> 00:15:39.238
TRILLION MARKET CAP ARRAYED

00:15:39.305 --> 00:15:41.206
AGAINST ESSENTIALLY ONE

00:15:41.273 --> 00:15:42.841
INDIVIDUAL WHICH IS A REALLY

00:15:42.908 --> 00:15:44.843
THROW TRIBUTE TO AMERICA --

00:15:44.910 --> 00:15:46.378
CALIFORNIA --

00:15:46.445 --> 00:15:49.882
BUT IT WORKED AND MANY OF YOU

00:15:49.948 --> 00:15:51.750
WERE THERE.

00:15:51.817 --> 00:15:52.818
THAT DAY WAS TODAY WON'T SOON

00:15:52.885 --> 00:15:54.386
FORGET THAT YOU'RE PROVIDING

00:15:54.453 --> 00:15:56.622
MANAGER AND THE FACT IT WAS

00:15:56.689 --> 00:15:57.823
BIPARTISAN.

00:15:57.890 --> 00:15:58.991
AND UNANIMOUS --

00:15:59.058 --> 00:16:00.726
TO ME IS A REAL INDICATION OF OF

00:16:00.793 --> 00:16:02.127
OF WHERE.

00:16:02.194 --> 00:16:04.563
THE STATE IS THAT --

00:16:04.630 --> 00:16:06.098
SO WHAT DID WE ACTUALLY DO.

00:16:06.165 --> 00:16:08.867
WE THE THREE MAIN ELEMENTS OF

00:16:08.934 --> 00:16:10.803
THE CPA. ONE IS THE RIGHT TO

00:16:10.869 --> 00:16:12.338
KNOW WHAT INFORMATION HAS BEEN

00:16:12.404 --> 00:16:14.873
COLLECTED ABOUT YOU.

00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:15.474
LET'S GO WITH ALL OF THE RIGHT

00:16:15.541 --> 00:16:15.941
TO KNOW.

00:16:16.008 --> 00:16:17.209
THE SECOND IS THE RIGHT TO SAY

00:16:17.276 --> 00:16:18.577
NO TO THE SALE OF THAT

00:16:18.644 --> 00:16:20.279
INFORMATION. TO HUNDREDS OF

00:16:20.346 --> 00:16:23.015
COMPANIES YOU'VE NEVER HEARD OF

00:16:23.082 --> 00:16:24.483
THAT'S RIGHT AS AN OPT OUT RIGHT.

00:16:24.550 --> 00:16:25.751
THEN THE THIRD IS THE RIGHT TO

00:16:25.818 --> 00:16:27.152
HAVE YOUR INFORMATION KEPT SAFE

00:16:27.219 --> 00:16:29.321
IN A IN AN ERA OF IDENTITY THEFT

00:16:29.388 --> 00:16:32.224
THAT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT RIGHT.

00:16:32.291 --> 00:16:33.025
STILL IT'S DRESS SOME OF THE

00:16:33.092 --> 00:16:34.226
MYTHS ONE OF THESE MYTHS IS THAT

00:16:34.293 --> 00:16:36.261
IT CAME TOGETHER IN A WEEK AND

00:16:36.328 --> 00:16:37.196
YOU KNOW WHO THE HECK IS ALSO

00:16:37.262 --> 00:16:37.996
RETIRED TO THE KIDS A PRIVACY

00:16:38.063 --> 00:16:40.332
EXPERTISE IT'S BEEN TWENTY YEARS

00:16:40.399 --> 00:16:41.633
WORKING IN THE SPACE.

00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:42.868
WELL IN FACT I DID TAKE TO REACH

00:16:42.935 --> 00:16:45.738
YOUR TO RESEARCH TO TRY TO TALK

00:16:45.804 --> 00:16:47.172
TO AS MANY PEOPLE AS I COULD BUT

00:16:47.239 --> 00:16:48.073
THE OTHER THING IS.

00:16:48.140 --> 00:16:49.241
WE BUILT IN MANY WAYS ON THE

00:16:49.308 --> 00:16:50.809
WORK OF EXPERTS THAT A COME

00:16:50.876 --> 00:16:52.411
BEFORE US SO YES I HADN'T SPENT

00:16:52.478 --> 00:16:54.179
TWENTY YEARS RESEARCHING IT BUT

00:16:54.246 --> 00:16:55.447
I CAN READ.

00:16:55.514 --> 00:16:57.049
AND THERE WERE A LOT OF GREAT

00:16:57.116 --> 00:16:57.783
IDEAS OUT THERE SO I'M GONNA

00:16:57.850 --> 00:16:59.451
GIVE YOU ONE LITTLE CASE STUDY

00:16:59.518 --> 00:17:01.387
OF OF OF ONE NIGHT ONE VERY

00:17:01.453 --> 00:17:02.988
CENTRAL PART OF OUR LAW.

00:17:03.055 --> 00:17:03.756
THERE IS THIS --

00:17:03.822 --> 00:17:05.491
EFFORT CALLED DO NOT TRACK JIM

00:17:05.557 --> 00:17:07.259
EFFORT AND START ABOUT TEN YEARS

00:17:07.326 --> 00:17:08.160
AGO.

00:17:08.227 --> 00:17:09.595
W. THREE C. STANDS FOR THE WORLD

00:17:09.661 --> 00:17:11.196
WIDE WEB CONSORTIUM.

00:17:11.263 --> 00:17:13.165
AND THEY TOOK A GROUP OF TRUE

00:17:13.232 --> 00:17:15.501
COMPUTER COMPUTER EXPERTS AT THE

00:17:15.567 --> 00:17:16.068
INTERSECTION OF PRIVACY IN

00:17:16.135 --> 00:17:16.869
TECHNOLOGY.

00:17:16.935 --> 00:17:17.736
WHO CAME UP WITH THIS IDEA THAT

00:17:17.803 --> 00:17:21.240
YOUR BROWSER KATE? TO COMPANIES

00:17:21.306 --> 00:17:21.840
WHETHER YOU WANT TO BE TRACTOR

00:17:21.907 --> 00:17:23.642
NOT.

00:17:23.709 --> 00:17:24.209
THERE WAS A GOOD IDEA WORK

00:17:24.276 --> 00:17:26.011
TECHNICALLY THE PROBLEM WAS IT

00:17:26.078 --> 00:17:29.148
WAS BASED ON INVOLUNTARY.

00:17:29.214 --> 00:17:30.082
IT'S OF SOME COMPANIES AUTHORED

00:17:30.149 --> 00:17:31.850
AT SOME DID NOT THE ADVERTISING

00:17:31.917 --> 00:17:33.318
INDUSTRY GENERALLY RESISTED IT.

00:17:33.385 --> 00:17:35.454
BUT AS A RESULT IT KIND OF ENDED

00:17:35.521 --> 00:17:35.754
UP FILLING.

00:17:35.821 --> 00:17:38.090
BUT NATIONAL EXPERTS HAD WORKED

00:17:38.157 --> 00:17:40.092
ON THIS FOR ALMOST A DECADE THIS

00:17:40.159 --> 00:17:41.527
IS THE ANTI TO ATTRACT.

00:17:41.593 --> 00:17:42.828
AND HERE'S THE HERE'S A LIST I

00:17:42.895 --> 00:17:43.429
THINK IT'S A PARTIAL LIST OF

00:17:43.495 --> 00:17:45.197
SOME OF THE YOU KNOW FOR PEOPLE

00:17:45.264 --> 00:17:46.398
IN THIS BUSINESS THESE ARE

00:17:46.465 --> 00:17:47.800
COUPLED FACE NAMES WITH RESPECT.

00:17:47.866 --> 00:17:49.134
TO THE PEOPLE AT THE

00:17:49.201 --> 00:17:49.701
INTERSECTION OF PRIVACY IN

00:17:49.768 --> 00:17:50.636
TECHNOLOGY.

00:17:50.702 --> 00:17:51.470
FULL DISCLOSURE I GOT THIS OFF

00:17:51.537 --> 00:17:53.138
THE INTERNET SO IF PEOPLE ARE ON

00:17:53.205 --> 00:17:53.672
IT WHO DON'T WANT TO BE I

00:17:53.739 --> 00:17:56.842
APOLOGIZE TO PEOPLE WHO AREN'T

00:17:56.909 --> 00:17:57.476
ON IT THINK THEY SHOULD AGAIN I

00:17:57.543 --> 00:17:58.777
APOLOGIZE.

00:17:58.844 --> 00:17:59.978
NOW THE NEXT SLIDE I WANT TO

00:18:00.045 --> 00:18:02.214
BRING UP IS DON'T READ IT

00:18:02.281 --> 00:18:03.382
BECAUSE IT'S TOO HARD TO READ

00:18:03.449 --> 00:18:04.249
ALL THE WORDS BUT WHAT I WANT TO

00:18:04.316 --> 00:18:05.384
SHOW YOU WAS AT THE BOLD

00:18:05.451 --> 00:18:07.352
UNDERLINE PARTS THIS IS FROM OUR

00:18:07.419 --> 00:18:08.754
DEFINITION OF BUSINESS PURPOSES.

00:18:08.821 --> 00:18:10.522
ARE ALL DRAWN DIRECTLY FROM DO

00:18:10.589 --> 00:18:12.524
NOT TRACK SO AGAIN WE WERE

00:18:12.591 --> 00:18:16.061
BUILDING ON THE WORK OF EXPERTS

00:18:16.128 --> 00:18:16.695
THAT I'M WORKING ON THIS PROBLEM

00:18:16.762 --> 00:18:17.196
FOR A DECADE.

00:18:17.262 --> 00:18:18.597
OUR DEFINITION OF THIRD PARTY

00:18:18.664 --> 00:18:20.933
AGAIN VERY CENTRAL TO OUR LAW.

00:18:20.999 --> 00:18:22.601
THE BOLD UNDERLINE PARTS ARE

00:18:22.668 --> 00:18:24.303
DRAWN DIRECTLY FROM DO NOT TRACK

00:18:24.369 --> 00:18:25.871
SO AGAIN ONE OF THE MESSAGES

00:18:25.938 --> 00:18:26.972
HERE IS THAT THE THING DIDN'T

00:18:27.039 --> 00:18:28.674
COME TOGETHER IN A WEEK IT TOOK

00:18:28.740 --> 00:18:31.276
ME TWO YEARS AND BY THE WAY.

00:18:31.343 --> 00:18:31.877
WE RELIED ON EXPERT TO A GONE

00:18:31.944 --> 00:18:33.645
BEFORE.

00:18:33.712 --> 00:18:34.379
NOW.

00:18:34.446 --> 00:18:35.280
ANOTHER AREAS GOTTEN SOME

00:18:35.347 --> 00:18:36.415
ATTENTION IS YOU KNOW WHO'S

00:18:36.482 --> 00:18:39.218
COVERED --

00:18:39.284 --> 00:18:40.052
BITE BY THE CPA.

00:18:40.118 --> 00:18:41.753
SO WE ONLY COVER BUSINESS NOT

00:18:41.820 --> 00:18:42.654
NONPROFITS NOT GOVERNMENT.

00:18:42.721 --> 00:18:45.724
AND BARS ARE IDEAL WAS LET'S GO

00:18:45.791 --> 00:18:46.358
WHERE THE PROBLEM IS WITH THE

00:18:46.425 --> 00:18:47.993
PROBLEMS WITH BIG BUSINESS AND

00:18:48.060 --> 00:18:49.661
IT A BROKER'S.

00:18:49.728 --> 00:18:50.128
SO WE HAVE THESE THREE

00:18:50.195 --> 00:18:51.964
THRESHOLDS TWENTY FIVE MILLION

00:18:52.030 --> 00:18:53.699
IN REVENUE FOR COMPANY --

00:18:53.765 --> 00:18:56.001
OR COPY THE COLLECTS FIFTY

00:18:56.068 --> 00:18:56.635
THOUSAND PIECE OF INFORMATION A

00:18:56.702 --> 00:18:59.371
YEAR. FOR DATA BROKERS TO GET

00:18:59.438 --> 00:19:01.340
OVER HALF OF THEIR REVENUE.

00:19:01.406 --> 00:19:03.375
FROM SELLING INFORMATION.

00:19:03.442 --> 00:19:05.077
NOW THE FIFTY THOUSAND PIECES.

00:19:05.143 --> 00:19:06.445
OF INFORMATION HAS GOTTEN SOME

00:19:06.512 --> 00:19:07.546
ATTENTION GOT SOME CRITICISM

00:19:07.613 --> 00:19:09.214
BECAUSE PEOPLE SAY WELL IF YOU

00:19:09.281 --> 00:19:10.949
HAVE A SMALL LITTLE BLOG.

00:19:11.016 --> 00:19:12.251
IN YOUR COLLECTING ONLY A

00:19:12.317 --> 00:19:13.085
HUNDRED THIRTY SEVEN PIECES YOU

00:19:13.151 --> 00:19:14.720
KNOW VISITORS A DAY YOU COULD

00:19:14.786 --> 00:19:15.220
HIT THAT FIFTY THOUSAND

00:19:15.287 --> 00:19:16.488
THRESHOLD.

00:19:16.555 --> 00:19:18.657
AND OUR ANSWER IS.

00:19:18.724 --> 00:19:20.092
OKAY BUT IT DEPENDS WHAT YOU'RE

00:19:20.158 --> 00:19:21.493
COLLECTING FROM PEOPLE.

00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:22.561
IF YOU'RE JUST COLLECTING AN I.

00:19:22.628 --> 00:19:23.929
P. ADDRESS.

00:19:23.996 --> 00:19:25.597
YOU CAN ACTUALLY IDENTIFY THE

00:19:25.664 --> 00:19:28.033
PERSON VISITING BECAUSE MULTIPLE

00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:28.567
PEOPLE CAN HAVE ONE I. P.

00:19:28.634 --> 00:19:29.701
ADDRESS.

00:19:29.768 --> 00:19:32.070
SO IN OUR LAW WE SAY LOOK A

00:19:32.137 --> 00:19:33.906
BUSINESS ISN'T OBLIGATED. TO

00:19:33.972 --> 00:19:35.407
PROVIDE THAT INFORMATION BACK IF

00:19:35.474 --> 00:19:36.308
YOU CAN IDENTIFY THE PERSON WITH

00:19:36.375 --> 00:19:38.844
CERTAINTY SO AN I. P. ADDRESS

00:19:38.911 --> 00:19:39.411
ALONE WOULD NOT BE PERSONAL

00:19:39.478 --> 00:19:40.779
INFORMATION.

00:19:40.846 --> 00:19:42.781
THAT SAID IF YOU'RE COLLECTING

00:19:42.848 --> 00:19:43.382
FIFTY THOUSAND PEOPLES CREDIT

00:19:43.448 --> 00:19:45.784

LAW.

00:19:52.190 --> 00:19:55.360
HAD A HIGHER THRESHOLD WE HAD A

00:19:55.427 --> 00:19:55.961
HUNDRED THOUSAND AN INITIATIVE

SELLING INFORMATION IN THE LAW.

00:19:58.864 --> 00:20:00.098
THE LEGISLATURE IN ITS WISDOM

00:20:00.165 --> 00:20:01.767
REDUCED IT TO FIFTY THOUSAND AND

00:20:01.833 --> 00:20:03.302
AND ITS COLLECTION BUT NEVER

00:20:03.368 --> 00:20:05.137
LESS THAT THE THAT THE BOB.

00:20:05.203 --> 00:20:05.771
A QUESTION FOR THIS COMMITTEE

00:20:05.837 --> 00:20:08.106

DOING WITH THE INFORMATION.

00:20:11.843 --> 00:20:14.846
NOW LET'S TURN TO OPT IN VERSUS

LAW SO.

00:20:19.718 --> 00:20:20.919

00:20:23.055 --> 00:20:25.290
WHICH CAME INTO EFFECT LAST MAY.

00:20:25.357 --> 00:20:25.624
SO.

00:20:36.335 --> 00:20:37.603
WE THINK THERE'S SOME PROBLEMS

00:20:37.669 --> 00:20:39.504
WITH UP WITH DOCTOR IN THERE SO

00:20:39.571 --> 00:20:41.306
OPERATIONAL ISSUES ONE IS SORT

POP UP ALL THE TIME THINK ABOUT

00:20:46.211 --> 00:20:47.112
NOW THE REST.

00:20:47.179 --> 00:20:48.046
THE SECOND IS THERE'S A THERE IS

00:20:48.113 --> 00:20:49.948
AN ELEMENT OF TAKE IT OR LEAVE

GOING HE'S COLLECTOR INFORMATION.

00:20:55.220 --> 00:20:56.021

INFORMATION SO THE FACT THAT --

00:21:00.092 --> 00:21:00.626
AND ASK IF THEY CAN CLICK MY

00:21:00.692 --> 00:21:03.362
INFORMATION MAY NOT MEAN AS MUCH.

00:21:03.428 --> 00:21:07.332
I KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF EFFORTS

00:21:07.399 --> 00:21:09.868
UNDER WAY IN AND IN YOUR WE

00:21:09.935 --> 00:21:11.036
DON'T THINK IT'S SO MUCH

00:21:11.103 --> 00:21:12.571
CONTROLLED THE CUSTOMER.

00:21:12.638 --> 00:21:13.238
AND THEN THERE'S THIS INNOVATION

00:21:13.305 --> 00:21:16.274
CHILL ASPECT WHERE YOU'RE MORE

00:21:16.341 --> 00:21:18.310
LIKELY TO GIVE CONSENT TO

00:21:18.377 --> 00:21:19.511
ACCOMPANY FIRST OF THE COLLECTOR

00:21:19.578 --> 00:21:20.946
INFORMATION AND WHEN YOU'VE

00:21:21.013 --> 00:21:21.546
NEVER HEARD OF STILL BAND NEW

00:21:21.613 --> 00:21:22.180
COMPANY.

00:21:22.247 --> 00:21:25.217
IN EUROPE DOESN'T HAVE ARTS FOR

00:21:25.283 --> 00:21:25.717
TWENTY FIVE MILLION OUR

00:21:25.784 --> 00:21:26.518
THRESHOLD MIGHT HAVE A PROBLEM

00:21:26.585 --> 00:21:27.352
SO WITH OTHER SOME OPERATIONAL

00:21:27.419 --> 00:21:28.920
ISSUES TO OPTED.

00:21:28.987 --> 00:21:31.089
IN ADDITION WHEN WE WERE DOING

00:21:31.156 --> 00:21:33.125
THE RESEARCH I WAS TALKING AS

00:21:33.191 --> 00:21:34.893
MANY APHRODITE AS I COULD AND

00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:36.495
SOME EXPERTS ADVISE ME HEY LOOK.

00:21:36.561 --> 00:21:38.196
IF YOU COULD OPT IN YOU YOU

00:21:38.263 --> 00:21:39.631
MIGHT HAVE THIS PROBLEM WITH THE

00:21:39.698 --> 00:21:42.100
AMERICAN LEGAL SYSTEM AND FIRST

00:21:42.167 --> 00:21:43.869
AMENDMENT RIGHTS OF CORPORATIONS.

00:21:43.935 --> 00:21:45.537
AND BECAUSE THIS IS THE

00:21:45.604 --> 00:21:46.438
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE I THINK ITS

00:21:46.505 --> 00:21:48.507
PURPOSE I'M A LITTLE DETAIL HERE

00:21:48.573 --> 00:21:50.308
BUT ESSENTIALLY.

00:21:50.375 --> 00:21:51.977
THERE'S A CASE --

00:21:52.044 --> 00:21:53.879
BUT I WAS ADVISED ABOUT CULTURAL --

00:21:53.945 --> 00:21:55.013
FOR SINUS HEALTH AT THE VERMONT

00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:57.349
DATA ABOUT CASE WHERE. FOR MY

00:21:57.416 --> 00:21:59.084
PASSED A LAW RESTRICTING

00:21:59.151 --> 00:22:02.988
PHARMACIES ABILITY. TO SELL.

00:22:03.055 --> 00:22:03.889
BOB PRESCRIBER IDENTIFYING

00:22:03.955 --> 00:22:07.059
INFORMATION. TWO DRUG MARKETING

00:22:07.125 --> 00:22:09.394
COMPANIES.

00:22:09.461 --> 00:22:10.462
THE DRUG WORKING COMPANIES TO

00:22:10.529 --> 00:22:12.197
GET TO THE SUPREME COURT AND AND

00:22:12.264 --> 00:22:12.764
ACTUALLY ONE AND THE LAW WAS

00:22:12.831 --> 00:22:13.965
THROWN OUT.

00:22:14.032 --> 00:22:15.367
AND WHAT'S REALLY INTERESTING

00:22:15.434 --> 00:22:17.636
HERE IS THE AYE AYE SHE'S

00:22:17.703 --> 00:22:18.170
COMPOSED LANGUAGE FROM THE

00:22:18.236 --> 00:22:18.937
DECISION.

00:22:19.004 --> 00:22:20.138
BUT A RESTRICTION ON DISCLOSURE

00:22:20.205 --> 00:22:22.040
IS A REGULATION SPEECH THE SALE

00:22:22.107 --> 00:22:22.674
OF INFORMATION IS DISCLOSURE FOR

00:22:22.741 --> 00:22:24.309
PROFIT.

00:22:24.376 --> 00:22:25.577
AND IF THE ACT TO DISCLOSING

00:22:25.644 --> 00:22:26.912
PUBLIC INFORMATION DON'T COST IS

00:22:26.978 --> 00:22:27.512
BEACH IS HARD TO MEASURE WHAT

00:22:27.579 --> 00:22:28.747
DOES.

00:22:28.814 --> 00:22:30.916
SO THE ADVICE I GOT WAS YOU KNOW

00:22:30.982 --> 00:22:32.551
IT'S NOT DISPOSITIVE IS NOT A

00:22:32.617 --> 00:22:34.386
100% BUT YOU KNOW YOU PUT A

00:22:34.453 --> 00:22:35.754
BLANKET RESTRICTION ON THE

00:22:35.821 --> 00:22:36.722
RIGHTS OF CORPORATIONS TO

00:22:36.788 --> 00:22:38.156
COLLECT INFORMATION YOU MAY BE

00:22:38.223 --> 00:22:40.125
RUNNING INTO THIS.

00:22:40.192 --> 00:22:41.560
ISSUE WHERE YOU HAVE A

00:22:41.626 --> 00:22:43.428
RESTRICTION OF THE FIRST MOMENT

00:22:43.495 --> 00:22:45.230
RIGHT TO CORPORATIONS NOW

00:22:45.297 --> 00:22:47.232
CONTRAST THAT WITH.

00:22:47.299 --> 00:22:49.501
AT THE DO NOT CALL FRAMEWORK.

00:22:49.568 --> 00:22:51.903
BUT DO NOT CALL.

00:22:51.970 --> 00:22:52.504
WITH ALL TO THE SUBJECT MONTH

00:22:52.571 --> 00:22:53.572
MULTIPLE LOSSES IN YOUR MEMBER

00:22:53.638 --> 00:22:55.140
YOU COULD PUT YOUR NAME ON A

00:22:55.207 --> 00:22:57.175
LIST AND SAY I DON'T WANT TO BE

00:22:57.242 --> 00:22:57.709
CONTACTED BY TELEMARKETERS

00:22:57.776 --> 00:22:58.810
ANYMORE.

00:22:58.877 --> 00:23:00.712
THIS WAS ALSO CHALLENGED.

00:23:00.779 --> 00:23:01.780
THIS WEEK ENDED UP BEING A TENTH

00:23:01.847 --> 00:23:04.449
CIRCUIT DECISION THAT ACTUALLY

00:23:04.516 --> 00:23:05.083
APPEAL TO THE SUPREME COURT THE

00:23:05.150 --> 00:23:06.251
SUPREME COURT DIDN'T.

00:23:06.318 --> 00:23:08.587
BOB AGREE TO HEAR AN AND THIS

00:23:08.653 --> 00:23:09.821
DECISION BASICALLY ENDED UP

00:23:09.888 --> 00:23:11.456
SAYING LOOK IF YOU'RE GIVING

00:23:11.523 --> 00:23:13.258
CONSUMERS ARE RIGHT.

00:23:13.325 --> 00:23:14.292
THAT'S FORMALLY DIFFERENT IT'S

00:23:14.359 --> 00:23:15.227
NOT TRAMPLING ON THE FIRST

00:23:15.293 --> 00:23:16.094
MEMBER RIGHT TO CORPORATIONS

00:23:16.161 --> 00:23:16.762
BECAUSE YOU'RE GIVING THE

00:23:16.828 --> 00:23:17.829
CONSUMER RIGHT TO GO DO

00:23:17.896 --> 00:23:18.997
SOMETHING WITH RESPECT TO A

00:23:19.064 --> 00:23:21.867
CORPORATION.

00:23:21.933 --> 00:23:24.336
SO THAT'S ANOTHER REASON WHY OPT

00:23:24.402 --> 00:23:25.370
OUT SEEM TO A SAFER BET IN

00:23:25.437 --> 00:23:26.471
ALWAYS GONNA SPEND ALL THIS

00:23:26.538 --> 00:23:27.139
MONEY I DIDN'T WANT TO SPEND ALL

00:23:27.205 --> 00:23:27.773
THIS MONEY IN AN UP.

00:23:27.839 --> 00:23:30.375
IN A COURT FIGHT AND AND LOSE.

00:23:30.442 --> 00:23:31.943
AND THEN THE FINAL REASON WHY WE

00:23:32.010 --> 00:23:33.378
THINK OPT OUT.

00:23:33.445 --> 00:23:34.513
REALLY MAKES SENSE IS BECAUSE

00:23:34.579 --> 00:23:36.648
HOW WHAT'S THE EXPERIENCE GOING

00:23:36.715 --> 00:23:37.349
TO BE LIKE FOR THE CONSUMER

00:23:37.415 --> 00:23:37.649
[inaudible]

00:23:37.716 --> 00:23:39.484
SO.

00:23:39.551 --> 00:23:40.418
YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO TELL

00:23:40.485 --> 00:23:41.186
CORPORATION NOT TO SELL YOUR

00:23:41.253 --> 00:23:43.121
INFORMATION.

00:23:43.188 --> 00:23:44.723
HOW DO YOU DO THAT WE REQUIRE

00:23:44.790 --> 00:23:46.124
THAT COMPANIES PUT A DO NOT SELL

00:23:46.191 --> 00:23:47.092
MY INFORMATION BUTTON YOU CAN

00:23:47.159 --> 00:23:48.827
CLICK?

00:23:48.894 --> 00:23:49.895
BUT YOU CAN KIND OF IMAGINE THAT

00:23:49.961 --> 00:23:51.263
MIGHT BE A LITTLE BIT CLUNKY

00:23:51.329 --> 00:23:51.830
ALWAYS HAVE TO CLICK THAT AS

00:23:51.897 --> 00:23:52.531
WELL [inaudible]

00:23:52.597 --> 00:23:54.332
SO.

00:23:54.399 --> 00:23:55.867
WHAT WE REQUIRE IS THAT

00:23:55.934 --> 00:23:58.336
COMPANIES HAVE TO HONOR A THIRD

00:23:58.403 --> 00:24:00.338
PARTY OPT OUT REQUEST AND WHAT

00:24:00.405 --> 00:24:01.706
IS THAT MEAN IN REAL LIFE?

00:24:01.773 --> 00:24:03.675
IN REAL LIFE I'M GONNA TALK TO

00:24:03.742 --> 00:24:04.709
THE BROWSER COMPANIES.

00:24:04.776 --> 00:24:05.911
AND THEY SAID LOOK WE WERE DOING

00:24:05.977 --> 00:24:07.045
THIS FOR DO NOT TRACK OF COURSE

00:24:07.112 --> 00:24:08.346
IF IT'S A LAW WILL DO THIS WE

00:24:08.413 --> 00:24:09.714
WOULD WE WOULD PUT A BROWSER

00:24:09.781 --> 00:24:10.982
EXTENSION INTO EVERYBODY'S

00:24:11.049 --> 00:24:12.551
BROWSER.

00:24:12.617 --> 00:24:14.986
ALLOW YOU TO SAID IT ONCE AND

00:24:15.053 --> 00:24:16.021
FORGET.

00:24:16.087 --> 00:24:17.489
EVERY VISIT TO EVERY WEBSITE YOU

00:24:17.556 --> 00:24:19.491
MAKE THE BROWSER FOR YOU WILL

00:24:19.558 --> 00:24:20.992
JUST INDICATE TO THAT WEBSITE

00:24:21.059 --> 00:24:23.829
DON'T SELL MY INFORMATION.

00:24:23.895 --> 00:24:24.629
SO WHAT WE'VE DONE WE'VE

00:24:24.696 --> 00:24:26.064
ACHIEVED DO NOT TRACK THROUGH

00:24:26.131 --> 00:24:27.732
LEGISLATION ALL THAT WORK THAT

00:24:27.799 --> 00:24:29.234
DOES EXPERTS DID FOR OVER A

00:24:29.301 --> 00:24:30.836
DECADE WE'VE ESSENTIALLY

00:24:30.902 --> 00:24:32.304
ACHIEVED DO NOT TRACK BY ANOTHER

00:24:32.370 --> 00:24:34.172
ROUTE.

00:24:34.239 --> 00:24:35.207
AND WE THINK IT'S A REALLY

00:24:35.273 --> 00:24:36.708
MOMENTOUS STEP FOR THIS LAW.

00:24:36.775 --> 00:24:38.343
WE THINK THAT THAT IS.

00:24:38.410 --> 00:24:39.411
THE END OF THE LARGE COMPANIES

00:24:39.477 --> 00:24:40.645
TRACKING ACROSS THE WEB AND WHAT

00:24:40.712 --> 00:24:42.180
I REALLY LIKE ABOUT IT AS A

00:24:42.247 --> 00:24:43.515
BUSINESS PERSON IS I THINK IT'S

00:24:43.582 --> 00:24:44.850
SIMPLE FOR CONSUMERS YOU DON'T

00:24:44.916 --> 00:24:45.750
TO DO VERY MUCH.

00:24:45.817 --> 00:24:47.052
WANTS YOU TO SET THAT IN YOUR

00:24:47.118 --> 00:24:47.786
BROWSER.

00:24:47.853 --> 00:24:50.722
AND FORGET IT.

00:24:50.789 --> 00:24:52.224
BUT THE MOVE TO ADVERTISING

00:24:52.290 --> 00:24:54.960
WHICH ALSO HAS BEEN A LITTLE BIT

00:24:55.026 --> 00:24:56.061
CONTENTIOUS IN THE SENSE THAT.

00:24:56.127 --> 00:24:57.495
WE PERMIT ADVERTISING.

00:24:57.562 --> 00:24:59.064
THE LAW PERMITS ADVERTISING AND

00:24:59.130 --> 00:25:01.700
YOU KNOW.

00:25:01.766 --> 00:25:03.335
THERE HAVE BEEN PEOPLE WHO'VE

00:25:03.401 --> 00:25:04.035
BEEN CONCERNED ABOUT THAT

00:25:04.102 --> 00:25:05.370
BECAUSE THEY SAY WELL THEY CAN

00:25:05.437 --> 00:25:07.072
TRACK YOU THROUGH ADS AND AND

00:25:07.138 --> 00:25:07.806
WHAT YOU'RE DOING YOU HAVEN'T

00:25:07.873 --> 00:25:08.907
REALLY DONE MUCH.

00:25:08.974 --> 00:25:09.674
AND THE POINT IS WELL IF WE

00:25:43.074 --> 00:25:43.942
WHICH IS HOW YOUR INFORMATION

00:25:44.009 --> 00:25:46.044
JUST GETS PROPAGATED JUST BY

FIRST AMENDMENT SO THERE'S NOT A

00:26:22.881 --> 00:26:24.049
EUROPEAN RIGHT TO BE FORGOTTEN

00:26:59.050 --> 00:27:00.585
BUTTON.

EIJI ENFORCES BY THE ACT.

00:27:03.154 --> 00:27:04.155
WE HAVE A PRIVATE RIGHT OF

NEGLIGENT DATA BREACHES AND WHAT

00:27:08.326 --> 00:27:09.361
THOSE ARE ARE.

00:27:09.427 --> 00:27:11.763
THERE THREE SAFE HARBORS IF THE

CURE NAME OUT OF THE DATA SAID.

00:27:17.235 --> 00:27:18.069

00:27:21.573 --> 00:27:22.307
VENDOR BUT THAT THEY'RE SAFE

00:27:22.374 --> 00:27:23.475
HARBORS FROM THE PRIVATE RIGHT

RIGHT OF ACTION FOR DATA BREACH.

00:27:26.211 --> 00:27:27.245
ESSENTIALLY THE REASON FOR THAT

00:27:27.312 --> 00:27:28.113
IS I DIDN'T WANT HAVE A

00:27:28.179 --> 00:27:29.180

RECENTLY.

00:27:45.997 --> 00:27:47.632
WHAT I WOULD SAY IS THIS WAS

00:27:47.699 --> 00:27:48.600

00:31:38.463 --> 00:31:39.731
HAVE.

00:31:39.797 --> 00:31:41.332
FOUND TO BE WITH THE MORE WE'VE

00:31:41.399 --> 00:31:42.567
KNOWN --

00:31:42.634 --> 00:31:46.371
FRUSTRATING AND I WANT --

00:31:46.437 --> 00:31:48.473
TO OF THE INCIDENT THAT IT THAT

00:31:48.539 --> 00:31:50.341
YOU JUST REFERENCE TWO WEEKS AGO

00:31:50.408 --> 00:31:51.976
WE LEARNED THAT.

00:31:52.043 --> 00:31:53.711
OF WOMEN WHO WERE --

00:31:53.778 --> 00:31:55.346
TRYING -- TO

00:31:55.413 --> 00:31:57.048
PERHAPS GET PREGNANT AND PUTTING

00:31:57.115 --> 00:31:59.417
INFORMATION INTOTHEIR FITBIT'S.

00:31:59.484 --> 00:32:01.686
OF THE DESCRIBED AS THEIR

00:32:01.753 --> 00:32:04.989
MENSTRUAL CYCLE SO THAT THEY

00:32:05.056 --> 00:32:05.890
KNOW WHEN THEY'RE OVULATING.

00:32:05.957 --> 00:32:06.791
THAT FACEBOOK WOULD GET THAT

00:32:06.858 --> 00:32:08.526
INFORMATION WITHOUT ANYONE'S

00:32:08.593 --> 00:32:10.395
KNOWLEDGE OR PERMISSION IS QUITE

00:32:10.461 --> 00:32:11.696
EXTRAORDINARY AND I THINK AN

00:32:11.763 --> 00:32:14.399
EXAMPLE OF A SOME OF THE MORE.

00:32:14.465 --> 00:32:17.168
OUTRAGEOUS BUT STILL EXISTING --

00:32:17.235 --> 00:32:18.803
POTENTIALS I MEAN I I THINK

00:32:18.870 --> 00:32:20.271
ABOUT IT YOU DON'T WANT YOUR

00:32:20.338 --> 00:32:21.606
MOTHER TO KNOW YOU'RE TRYING TO

00:32:21.673 --> 00:32:23.374
GET PREGNANT YOU CERTAINLY DON'T

00:32:23.441 --> 00:32:24.342
WANT SOMEBODY.

00:32:24.409 --> 00:32:27.312
WHO'S A COMPLETE STRANGER TO

00:32:27.378 --> 00:32:28.279
HAVE THAT INFORMATION EITHER.

00:32:28.346 --> 00:32:30.248
AND THIS IS THE KIND OF THING

00:32:30.315 --> 00:32:32.116
THAT WE ARE SEEING SO --

00:32:32.183 --> 00:32:33.918
YOUR EFFORTS REALLY HAVE I THINK

00:32:33.985 --> 00:32:35.720
MADE AN EXTRAORDINARY DIFFERENCE

00:32:35.787 --> 00:32:37.655
AND I WANT TO THANK YOU PUBLICLY

00:32:37.722 --> 00:32:39.524
FOR YOUR FOR DOING THAT --

00:32:39.590 --> 00:32:42.327
I DO HAVE ONE QUESTION --

00:32:42.393 --> 00:32:46.364
AND I I REALIZE THAT THIS WAS A

00:32:46.431 --> 00:32:48.499
A WHITE KNUCKLE OR AND BOTH A A

00:32:48.566 --> 00:32:50.301
KNUCKLE IN WHITE KNUCKLE EFFORT

00:32:50.368 --> 00:32:52.670
BECAUSE TO GET THOSE INDUSTRIES

00:32:52.737 --> 00:32:54.706
THE SIX TRILLION DOLLARS WORTH

00:32:54.772 --> 00:32:57.775
OF OPPOSITION TO COME TO THE

00:32:57.842 --> 00:32:59.344
TABLE AND TO RESOLVE THIS WAS AT

00:32:59.410 --> 00:33:00.812
BEFORE THE INITIATIVE WAS QUITE

00:33:00.878 --> 00:33:01.979
AN EFFORT.

00:33:02.046 --> 00:33:03.214
BUT I WONDER IF YOU COULD SHARE

00:33:03.281 --> 00:33:04.882
WITH US --

00:33:04.949 --> 00:33:09.220
WHAT MORE IT NEEDS TO BE DONE TO

00:33:09.287 --> 00:33:11.489
EFFECTUATE YOUR INTENT?

00:33:11.556 --> 00:33:13.257
RECOGNIZING THEIR COMPROMISES

00:33:13.324 --> 00:33:15.360
MADE BUT IF YOU WERE AS I OFTEN

00:33:15.426 --> 00:33:16.994
ASK THE MASTER OF THE UNIVERSE

00:33:17.061 --> 00:33:18.963
WHAT WOULD YOU DO MORE. TO

00:33:19.030 --> 00:33:20.932
EFFECTUATE YOUR INTENT.

00:33:20.998 --> 00:33:22.467
YOU KNOW I THINK I THINK --

00:33:22.533 --> 00:33:26.237
THE THE THE PART THAT WAS FOR

00:33:26.304 --> 00:33:27.905
THE MOST PAINFUL FOR ME GIVING

00:33:27.972 --> 00:33:28.506
UP.

00:33:28.573 --> 00:33:30.441
WAS THE WHISTLEBLOWER --

00:33:30.508 --> 00:33:31.509
WE ARE WITH THE BOAT BLOWER

00:33:31.576 --> 00:33:32.744
PROVISION IN THAT --

00:33:32.810 --> 00:33:34.512
AND THAT WAS HARD BECAUSE I FELT

00:33:34.579 --> 00:33:36.280
LIKE SOMETIMES DEEP IN THE

00:33:36.347 --> 00:33:37.382
BOWELS THESE COMPANIES YOU'RE

00:33:37.448 --> 00:33:38.383
YOU IT COULD BE HARD TO FIGURE

00:33:38.449 --> 00:33:39.350
OUT WHAT'S GOING ON AND IF

00:33:39.417 --> 00:33:40.718
YOU'RE GONNA NEED SOMEONE

00:33:40.785 --> 00:33:42.253
SOPHISTICATED --

00:33:42.320 --> 00:33:44.122
TO TAKE A CHANCE SO THAT'S KIND

00:33:44.188 --> 00:33:47.191
OF AN AREA I THINK --

00:33:47.258 --> 00:33:48.393
I THINK THAT THERE ARE --

00:33:48.459 --> 00:33:49.861
SOME CLARIFICATIONS THAT COULD

00:33:49.927 --> 00:33:51.596
BE MADE LIKE FOR EXAMPLE --

00:33:51.662 --> 00:33:52.764
I KNOW.

00:33:52.830 --> 00:33:55.266
HOUSEHOLDS GOTTEN A LOT OF PRESS

00:33:55.333 --> 00:33:57.702
BECAUSE HOUSEHOLD WAS PUT IN AT

00:33:57.769 --> 00:33:58.503
THE LAST MINUTE WASN'T IN OUR

00:33:58.569 --> 00:33:59.637
INITIATIVE --

00:33:59.704 --> 00:34:01.572
THERE'S SOME REAL --

00:34:01.639 --> 00:34:03.107
REASONS THAT EIGHTY EIGHT THE

00:34:03.174 --> 00:34:03.941
NEED TO BE ADDRESSED AT THE SAME

00:34:04.008 --> 00:34:05.176
TIME IT DOES THE DEFINITION SO

00:34:05.243 --> 00:34:06.944
THERE THERE'S THINGS LIKE THAT

00:34:07.011 --> 00:34:09.847
SO I THINK TO SOME CLARIFYING LE.

00:34:09.914 --> 00:34:11.449
AREAS -- BUT

00:34:11.516 --> 00:34:12.049
HONESTLY I MEAN I I WILL SAY

00:34:12.116 --> 00:34:14.719
THAT THE THE ODD CIRCUMSTANCE OF

00:34:14.786 --> 00:34:17.388
THE HAVING THAT INITIATIVE AND

00:34:17.455 --> 00:34:18.122
HAVING.

00:34:18.189 --> 00:34:19.490
SOMETHING WHERE THE COMPANY'S

00:34:19.557 --> 00:34:21.025
UNDERSTOOD THAT THIS IS PULLING

00:34:21.092 --> 00:34:22.393
80%.

00:34:22.460 --> 00:34:24.629
AND THEY UNDERSTOOD THAT. TO GET

00:34:24.695 --> 00:34:25.229
EIGHTY DOWN A FIFTY WAS GONNA

00:34:25.296 --> 00:34:26.864
COST A A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF

00:34:26.931 --> 00:34:28.199
MONEY BUT BE WAS GONNA REQUIRED

00:34:28.266 --> 00:34:29.834
THEM TO BE SPENDING MONEY

00:34:29.901 --> 00:34:31.302
AGAINST THEIR OWN CUSTOMERS SOME

00:34:31.369 --> 00:34:32.336
OF THEIR CUSTOMERS CARE ABOUT

00:34:32.403 --> 00:34:33.671
THE NEW THAT WAS KIND OF

00:34:33.738 --> 00:34:34.572
UNTENABLE SO THAT WAS A IT WAS

00:34:34.639 --> 00:34:35.773
AN ODD DYNAMIC.

00:34:35.840 --> 00:34:38.176
WHICH I DON'T THINK WOULD EXIST --

00:34:38.242 --> 00:34:39.977
INITIAL SITUATIONS AND SO WE DID

00:34:40.044 --> 00:34:41.312
HAVE QUITE A LOT OF POWER TO TO

00:34:41.379 --> 00:34:42.380
SORT OF SAY THIS IS THE WAY IT'S

00:34:42.447 --> 00:34:43.714
GOING TO BE IN AND WE END UP I

00:34:43.781 --> 00:34:45.116
THINK WITH A GREAT LAW.

00:34:45.183 --> 00:34:46.784

ISSUES.

00:35:46.611 --> 00:35:48.446
THAT WE WE WE ENCOUNTERED IS --

00:35:48.513 --> 00:35:49.647
WHEN WE TALKED ABOUT ONE OF OUR

00:35:49.714 --> 00:35:50.248
DID WAS TO MAKE IT A PROPERTY

00:35:50.314 --> 00:35:50.648
RIGHT [inaudible]

YOU CAN'T MAKE IT PROPER RIGHT

00:35:55.753 --> 00:35:56.854
BECAUSE YOU CAN ALIENATE A

00:35:56.921 --> 00:35:58.022

00:36:34.325 --> 00:36:37.161
DIFFICULT TO ATTACH ANY SORT OF

PROPERTY RIGHT TO IT WAS CLEAR

00:36:39.096 --> 00:36:41.465

AND THE STATE'S --

00:36:59.850 --> 00:37:01.118
DID AND THEN I THINK EVENTUALLY

00:37:01.185 --> 00:37:02.687
THERE WASN'T A NATIONAL --

00:37:02.753 --> 00:37:04.622
BUT IT READ IT IT IT IT IT

00:37:04.689 --> 00:37:06.023
STARTED WITH THE STATE'S AND I

00:37:06.090 --> 00:37:07.491
AS I BELIEVE THAT MR MARKETING

00:37:07.558 --> 00:37:08.960
WAS A STATE --

00:37:09.026 --> 00:37:10.962
CASE.

00:37:11.028 --> 00:37:12.697
SO IN YOUR ODYSSEY.

00:37:12.763 --> 00:37:14.498
OF PURSUING THIS DID YOU

00:37:14.565 --> 00:37:16.567
CONTEMPLATE THAT MAY BE A

00:37:16.634 --> 00:37:18.769
CLEARING HOUSE STYLE AT THE

00:37:18.836 --> 00:37:20.671
STATE LEVEL.

00:37:20.738 --> 00:37:24.208
WOULD TAKE AWAY --

00:37:24.275 --> 00:37:25.743
ALL THE UNCERTAINTIES FOR THOSE

00:37:25.810 --> 00:37:28.245
THAT DON'T WANT TO PARTICIPATE.

00:37:28.312 --> 00:37:31.215
IN IN THE INFORMATION EXCHANGING

00:37:31.282 --> 00:37:33.284
TECHNOLOGY.

00:37:33.351 --> 00:37:36.520
I CAN TO A DO NOT CALL LIST.

00:37:36.587 --> 00:37:38.656
WE DID IN ON IT FRANKLY ONE OF

00:37:38.723 --> 00:37:39.624
THE THINGS WE WERE DOING WAS

00:37:39.690 --> 00:37:41.158
WHEN WE'RE DOING INITIATIVE WE

00:37:41.225 --> 00:37:43.327
WERE TRYING TO CRAFT SOMETHING

00:37:43.394 --> 00:37:45.496
THAT WOULD SURVIVE.

00:37:45.563 --> 00:37:47.264
WITHOUT ANY OBVIOUS ATTACK.

00:37:47.331 --> 00:37:48.699
VECTORS OF ATTACK AGAINST IT AND

00:37:48.766 --> 00:37:50.568
SO THE IDEA OF CREATING UP LIKE

00:37:50.635 --> 00:37:52.637
AN AGENCY OR SOMETHING WAS GOING.

00:37:52.703 --> 00:37:53.738
TO THEIR HOUSE TAKE TAKE SOME

00:37:53.804 --> 00:37:55.006
MONEY.

00:37:55.072 --> 00:37:55.640
AND WE KNEW THAT THAT WOULD BE

00:37:55.706 --> 00:37:57.141
SOMETHING FOR THE OPPONENTS TO

00:37:57.208 --> 00:37:58.409
BE LIKE OH YOU'RE JUST TRYING TO

00:37:58.476 --> 00:38:00.244
BUILD AN AGENCY SO THEY COULD

MAYBE ATTACK US ON THAT.

00:38:02.279 --> 00:38:02.847

00:38:02.913 --> 00:38:05.883
THE ESSENTIALLY CARDS ON WEIGHT --

00:38:05.950 --> 00:38:09.186

COULD BE PURSUED FURTHER I THINK

00:40:55.820 --> 00:40:57.755
IN MOST INSTANCES THERE WILL BE

00:40:57.822 --> 00:40:59.757
SOME CONTACT WITH THE STATE OF

00:40:59.824 --> 00:41:01.358
CALIFORNIA I THINK IT WOULD BE

00:41:01.425 --> 00:41:02.393
UNLIKELY THAT YOU WOULD.

00:41:02.459 --> 00:41:04.628
HAVE TOO MANY INSTANCES IN WHICH

00:41:04.695 --> 00:41:05.896

CALIFORNIA BUT IT'S IT'S

00:41:12.570 --> 00:41:13.571
SOMETHING THAT THE COMMITTEE

00:41:13.637 --> 00:41:14.839
COULD CERTAINLY PURSUE FURTHER.

00:41:14.905 --> 00:41:16.407
THANK YOU.

00:41:16.473 --> 00:41:17.975

00:41:24.248 --> 00:41:26.350
DECADES. ONE THING THAT WE'VE

00:41:26.417 --> 00:41:29.019
DONE WITH OUR AIR STANDARDS IS

00:41:29.086 --> 00:41:31.655
AUTO MANUFACTURERS NOW BUILD

00:41:31.722 --> 00:41:32.790
THEIR CARS TO THE HIGHEST

00:41:32.857 --> 00:41:36.527

VEHICLES SOLD IN OKLAHOMA

00:41:38.229 --> 00:41:39.563
KENTUCKY.

TALK TO VARIOUS MEMBERS ABOUT IT

00:42:00.351 --> 00:42:02.019
I THINK IT'S NOT LOST ON ANYONE

00:42:02.086 --> 00:42:04.188
THAT 20% OF THE HOUSE MAJORITY

00:42:04.255 --> 00:42:05.522
IS FROM THE STATE --

00:42:05.589 --> 00:42:06.690
INCLUDING SOME IMPORTANT

00:42:06.757 --> 00:42:08.058
COMMITTEE CHAIRS --

00:42:08.125 --> 00:42:09.026
AND WHAT I'VE HEARD FROM

00:42:09.093 --> 00:42:10.628
EVERYBODY'S THUS FAR THERE IS

00:42:10.694 --> 00:42:12.029
THAT -- A

00:42:12.096 --> 00:42:14.865
BILL TO PREEMPT CALIFORNIA WITH

00:42:14.932 --> 00:42:17.134
A WEAKER STANDARD WON'T HAPPEN --

00:42:17.201 --> 00:42:19.637
THEY WILL LET US.

00:42:19.703 --> 00:42:20.571
YOU KNOW I THINK IS PLENTY OF

00:42:20.638 --> 00:42:21.772
NATIONAL EXAMPLE FOR EXAMPLE

00:42:21.839 --> 00:42:23.207
HIPPA THE HEALTH LAW AND SHE'LL

00:42:23.274 --> 00:42:24.942
BE A GRAMM LEACH BLILEY THE

00:42:25.009 --> 00:42:25.843
FINANCIAL LAW.

00:42:25.910 --> 00:42:26.877
ARE BOTH WITH THE CALL FLOORS

00:42:26.944 --> 00:42:28.245
NOT CEILINGS THE SET NATIONAL

00:42:28.312 --> 00:42:29.380
STANDARDS.

00:42:29.446 --> 00:42:30.281
BUT THEY LET THE STATE'S GO

00:42:30.347 --> 00:42:31.582
BEYOND I THINK THAT THE

00:42:31.649 --> 00:42:33.150
APPROPRIATE THING TO DO HERE.

00:42:33.217 --> 00:42:34.818
MY FINAL POINT ON THIS IS THE

00:42:34.885 --> 00:42:37.488
THERE I THINK TECH IS TRYING TO

00:42:37.554 --> 00:42:39.056
SELL THIS.

00:42:39.123 --> 00:42:39.390
WORRY THAT --

00:42:39.456 --> 00:42:39.957
FIFTY DIFFERENT STANDARDS WE

00:42:40.024 --> 00:42:43.560
CAN'T APPLY AND MY ANSWER TO

00:42:43.627 --> 00:42:45.429
THAT IS TO TWO POINT YOU JUST

00:42:45.496 --> 00:42:45.896
RAISED.

00:42:45.963 --> 00:42:46.964
I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE

00:42:47.031 --> 00:42:48.532
ABSOLUTELY UNTENABLE FOR

00:42:48.599 --> 00:42:50.434
CONSUMER FACING COMPANY.

00:42:50.501 --> 00:42:52.136
ON JANUARY SECOND NEXT YEAR TO

SAY THE RESIDENTS OF NEW YORK.

00:42:53.704 --> 00:42:56.440
OR ILLINOIS OR OR TEXAS HEY BY

00:42:56.507 --> 00:42:57.741
THE WAY ALL YOUR GOAL TO BE YOU

00:42:57.808 --> 00:42:58.409
KNOW WHEN YOUR FRIENDS AND

00:42:58.475 --> 00:42:59.343
RELATIVES IN CALIFORNIA NOW

00:42:59.410 --> 00:43:00.911
RIGHT THAT YOU DON'T HAVE I JUST

00:43:00.978 --> 00:43:02.046
I DON'T SEE THAT THAT'S GOING TO

00:43:02.112 --> 00:43:02.279
HAPPEN.

00:43:02.346 --> 00:43:04.181
SO I AM NOT PARTICULAR WORD BY

00:43:04.248 --> 00:43:05.849
THE FIFTY STATES THING AND EVEN

00:43:05.916 --> 00:43:07.217
IF THERE WERE FIFTY STATES

00:43:07.284 --> 00:43:08.118
LIQUOR FIFTY DIFFERENT DATA RICH

00:43:08.185 --> 00:43:10.454
LAWS AND YOU KNOW WHAT.

00:43:10.521 --> 00:43:11.422
BUSINESS KEEPS ON GOING.

00:43:11.488 --> 00:43:12.890
SO A FEW YEARS AGO I CARRIED

00:43:12.957 --> 00:43:15.659
LEGISLATION UNSUCCESSFULLY

00:43:15.726 --> 00:43:17.127
LOOKING AT THE AUTO INDUSTRY.

00:43:17.194 --> 00:43:20.030
WE NOW HAVE COMPUTERS ON WHEELS.

00:43:20.097 --> 00:43:21.699

YOU OWN IT.

00:43:23.500 --> 00:43:25.135
BUT IT CONTINUALLY IS GENERATING

00:43:25.202 --> 00:43:27.404
DATA -- THAT

00:43:27.471 --> 00:43:29.106
IS USED BY INSURANCE COMPANIES

00:43:29.173 --> 00:43:32.476
SOLD TO INSURANCE COMPANIES --

YOUR QUESTION BOWED TO ANSWER A

00:47:25.108 --> 00:47:26.376
DIFFERENT WAY ONE OF THE WAYS TO

00:47:26.443 --> 00:47:27.377
THINK ABOUT THIS BILL AS WE GIVE

00:47:27.444 --> 00:47:28.512
THE EIGHT A TURNING GENERAL

00:47:28.579 --> 00:47:30.781
TREMENDOUS ABILITY OR POWER. TO

00:47:30.847 --> 00:47:33.016
ISSUE REGULATIONS IN FURTHERANCE

00:47:33.083 --> 00:47:34.117
OF THE ACT.

00:47:34.184 --> 00:47:36.119
AND SO MIGHT INTENTION WAS NOT

00:47:36.186 --> 00:47:37.154
TO SET SOME IN STONE AND SAY

00:47:37.221 --> 00:47:38.855
THAT'S A FOREVER THING BECAUSE I

00:47:38.922 --> 00:47:39.823
THINK THIS IS MOVING WITH THE

00:47:39.890 --> 00:47:40.991
TIMES AND SO THAT'S THE KIND OF

00:47:41.058 --> 00:47:42.326
THING WHERE YOU COULD SAY OKAY

00:47:42.392 --> 00:47:43.293
THIS IS WHAT THE REGULATION

00:47:43.360 --> 00:47:44.661
MEANS AND THEN TO THE EXTENT

00:47:44.728 --> 00:47:44.928
THAT YOU.

00:47:44.995 --> 00:47:45.729
FIND IS BEING ABUSED.

00:47:45.796 --> 00:47:47.564
OR THE NEEDS FIXING YOU COULD

00:47:47.631 --> 00:47:48.699
PROBABLY FIX THAT WITH THE

00:47:48.765 --> 00:47:49.666
REGULATION FROM THE ATTORNEY

00:47:49.733 --> 00:47:51.602
GENERAL ENFORCING SO IS MY IS MY

00:47:51.668 --> 00:47:52.102
HOPE.

00:47:52.169 --> 00:47:53.904
THAT THE I THINK THE REASON WE

00:47:53.971 --> 00:47:55.339
PUT IT IN THERE IS BECAUSE I WAS

00:47:55.405 --> 00:47:58.442

TO NOT TRAMPLE ON FIRST MEMORIZE

00:48:01.178 --> 00:48:02.512
FOR THE THE THE WAY THE BOUNCING

00:48:02.579 --> 00:48:04.548
BALL WOULD WORK AS THEY HAVE MY

00:48:04.615 --> 00:48:06.617

00:48:06.683 --> 00:48:07.284

00:48:07.351 --> 00:48:08.819
THEY SAY NO THIS IS A FREE

00:48:08.885 --> 00:48:13.056
SPEECH EXPRESSION THAT I ASKED

00:48:13.123 --> 00:48:13.690

DESIGNED TO ENSURE TRANSPARENCY.

01:03:39.448 --> 01:03:40.716
THIS IS CPA GOES FARTHER THAN

01:03:55.631 --> 01:03:57.333
THAT'S THE FINAL POINT.

01:03:57.400 --> 01:03:59.669
IN MY EXPERIENCE THE PROTECTION

01:03:59.735 --> 01:04:01.604

IMPORTANT TO QUICKLY HIGHLIGHTS

01:07:25.641 --> 01:07:26.909
THE FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCES

THE G. P. R. DOESN'T TELL YOU

01:08:04.413 --> 01:08:05.915
WITH THIS LAW IS A CHALLENGE.

01:08:05.981 --> 01:08:07.450
IN THE US OUR LAWS ARE VERY

01:08:07.516 --> 01:08:09.652

01:08:09.718 --> 01:08:12.054
YOU WHAT TO DO --

01:08:12.121 --> 01:08:12.621
HOPING I WOULD TELL YOU WE

WITH THIS APPROACH.

01:08:17.793 --> 01:08:19.028
IN THE PLUS COLUMN IT GIVES

01:08:19.094 --> 01:08:21.063
CLARITY TO BUSINESS THEY CAN SAY

01:08:21.130 --> 01:08:22.898
THEY HAVE CHECKED THE BOXES THEY

01:08:27.002 --> 01:08:27.837
AUDITS.

01:08:27.903 --> 01:08:28.838
IN THE MINUS COLUMN IT MEANS

01:08:28.904 --> 01:08:30.239
THAT SOME U. S. LAWS MAY BE OVER

01:08:30.306 --> 01:08:33.275

AND DRAFTING PRESCRIPTIVE LAWS

01:08:43.452 --> 01:08:44.720
AND SUCH NARROWLY TAILORED

01:08:44.787 --> 01:08:46.255
CONTACTS ARE LESS LIKELY TO GIVE

01:08:46.322 --> 01:08:48.924
RISE TO UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES.

01:08:48.991 --> 01:08:50.459
THE US IS NOT HOWEVER HAD A

ACROSS ALL INDUSTRIES IN PART

01:08:54.230 --> 01:08:55.498
BECAUSE IT'S DIFFICULT TO CRAFT

01:08:55.564 --> 01:08:57.233
A REGULATION THAT IS BOTH

01:08:57.299 --> 01:08:58.567
SPECIFIC AND THEN OPERATIONALLY

SPECIFIC ROADMAP TO COMPLIANCE

01:09:09.879 --> 01:09:11.514
ALLOWED COMPANIES FLEXIBILITY TO

01:09:17.920 --> 01:09:19.455
COMPLIANCE PROGRAM AND A MATTER

01:09:19.522 --> 01:09:20.756
THAT BALANCE THEIR BUSINESS

01:09:20.823 --> 01:09:22.758
PRACTICES WITH THEIR PRIVACY

01:09:22.825 --> 01:09:23.592
OBLIGATIONS.

01:09:23.659 --> 01:09:25.027
THIS DOESN'T MEAN THAT COMPANIES

01:09:25.094 --> 01:09:27.696
WERE JUST LEFT TO THEIR PASSED --

01:09:27.763 --> 01:09:29.298
AND THE ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS OVER

01:09:29.365 --> 01:09:30.165
THE PAST FEW MONTHS MAKE THAT

01:09:30.232 --> 01:09:31.767
CLEAR BUT IT DOES MEAN THAT

01:09:31.834 --> 01:09:33.402
STRONG PRIVACY PROTECTION AND

01:09:33.469 --> 01:09:34.970
REGULATORY FLEXIBILITY CAN GO

01:09:35.037 --> 01:09:36.972
HAND IN HAND.

01:09:37.039 --> 01:09:38.507
SO SPEAK TO A DUTY COMPLIANCE

01:09:38.574 --> 01:09:39.875
LOOKS LIKE IN PRACTICE.

01:09:39.942 --> 01:09:41.544
A GPR COMPLIANCE PROGRAM CAN BE

01:09:41.610 --> 01:09:43.879
THOUGHT OF AS HAVING THREE KEY

01:09:43.946 --> 01:09:45.381
PHASES BEGINNING WITH DISCOVERY.

01:09:45.447 --> 01:09:46.515
IN THE DISCOVERY PHASE COMPANIES

01:09:46.582 --> 01:09:47.950
TAKE STOCK OF THEIR CURRENT

01:09:48.017 --> 01:09:49.485
PRACTICES THEY WORK WITH

01:09:49.552 --> 01:09:51.220
INTERNAL STAKEHOLDERS OFTEN

01:09:51.287 --> 01:09:53.155
EXTERNAL VENDORS AND COMPANIES

01:09:53.222 --> 01:09:54.623
TAKE INVENTORY OF THE DATA THEY

01:09:54.690 --> 01:09:56.825
COLLECT THE SOURCE OF THE DATA.

01:09:56.892 --> 01:09:58.093
HOW THE DATA IS USED TO IT

01:09:58.160 --> 01:09:59.428
SHARED WITH INTERNALLY AND

01:09:59.495 --> 01:10:01.497
EXTERNALLY WHERE IT'S STORED AND

01:10:01.564 --> 01:10:02.965
THEN WHAT SECURITY PATROLS ARE

01:10:03.032 --> 01:10:03.999
APPLIED?

01:10:04.066 --> 01:10:05.234
THIS INVOLVES AND PUT FROM

01:10:05.301 --> 01:10:06.902
EVERYONE FROM THE BUSINESS TO I.

01:10:06.969 --> 01:10:07.970
T. IN LEGAL.

01:10:08.037 --> 01:10:09.171
AT SOME POINT UNDERSTAND IT FOR

01:10:09.238 --> 01:10:11.006
MANY COMPANIES DATA STORED IN

01:10:11.073 --> 01:10:12.541
UNSTRUCTURED FORMATS ACROSS

01:10:12.608 --> 01:10:13.842
MULTIPLE DATABASES WITH A

01:10:13.909 --> 01:10:15.244
VARIETY OF OWNERS.

01:10:15.311 --> 01:10:16.845
ORGANIZING THIS INFORMATION

01:10:16.912 --> 01:10:18.347
ACROSS THE COMPANY NO BOTH FOR

01:10:18.414 --> 01:10:20.049
LARGE COMPANIES WITH COMPLICATED

01:10:20.115 --> 01:10:21.550
ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURES AND

01:10:21.617 --> 01:10:23.152
FOR SMALL COMPANIES AS WELL IS A

01:10:23.218 --> 01:10:26.155
COSTLY AND TIME CONSUMING EFFORT.

01:10:26.221 --> 01:10:27.823
NEXT ONE THE COMPANY UNDERSTANDS

01:10:27.890 --> 01:10:29.558
OUR DATA LANDSCAPE IT CONDUCTS A

01:10:29.625 --> 01:10:31.226
GAP ANALYSIS TO DETERMINE THE

01:10:31.293 --> 01:10:33.329
GAPS BETWEEN THEIR PRACTICES AND

01:10:33.395 --> 01:10:34.663
THE REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS.

01:10:34.730 --> 01:10:35.731
AND I'LL GIVE YOU A FEW KEY

01:10:35.798 --> 01:10:37.433
QUESTIONS THAT A COMPANY WILL

01:10:37.499 --> 01:10:38.901
ASK ITSELF DURING THIS PHASE.

01:10:38.968 --> 01:10:40.169
THE FIRST WHAT'S --

01:10:40.235 --> 01:10:41.971
AND THIS IS FOR GPR WHAT IS A

01:10:42.037 --> 01:10:44.206
LAWFUL BASIS WILL RELY ON FOR

01:10:44.273 --> 01:10:45.374
ITS PROCESSING ACTIVITIES.

01:10:45.441 --> 01:10:47.076
THE G. P. R. REQUIRES A COMPANY

01:10:47.142 --> 01:10:48.077
TO HAVE A LAWFUL BASIS FOR

01:10:48.143 --> 01:10:50.112
PROCESSING DATA AND THERE ARE

01:10:50.179 --> 01:10:51.513
SIX OPTIONS INCLUDING CONSENT

01:10:51.580 --> 01:10:53.349
AND LEGITIMATE INTEREST ACTUALLY

01:10:53.415 --> 01:10:54.783
ISN'T AN NOTICE AND CONSENT

01:10:54.850 --> 01:10:56.518
REGIME YOU GOT YOU HAVE TO GET

01:10:56.585 --> 01:10:57.853
CONSENT TO DROP A COOKIE UNDER

01:10:57.920 --> 01:10:59.355
THE PRIVACY DIRECTIVE.

01:10:59.421 --> 01:11:01.423
BUT FOR G. P. R. PURPOSES ARE

01:11:01.490 --> 01:11:04.093
SIX BASIS THAT'S OUR PROCESSING

01:11:04.159 --> 01:11:06.962
YOUR PERSONAL PERSONAL DATA.

01:11:07.029 --> 01:11:08.297
AND CONSENT A LEGITIMATE

01:11:08.364 --> 01:11:09.932
INTEREST OUR MOST POPULAR FOR

01:11:09.999 --> 01:11:12.067
BUSINESSES AND THEY HAVE THEIR

01:11:12.134 --> 01:11:12.501
OWN REQUIREMENTS AND

01:11:12.568 --> 01:11:14.069
CONSEQUENCES. FOR A COMPANY IS

01:11:14.136 --> 01:11:15.471
RELYING ON CONSENT IT'S

01:11:15.537 --> 01:11:16.672
IMPORTANT UNDERSTAND IF THAT

01:11:16.739 --> 01:11:18.741
MEANS THE G. P. R.'S STANDARDS

01:11:18.807 --> 01:11:21.110
IS IT SPECIFIC IS AN UNAMBIGUOUS

01:11:21.176 --> 01:11:22.578
IS IT FREELY GIVEN ME THAT

01:11:22.645 --> 01:11:23.712
THERE'S A CHA AN ACTUAL REAL

01:11:23.779 --> 01:11:25.848
CHOICE ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT YOU

01:11:25.914 --> 01:11:26.915
GIVE CONSENT.

01:11:26.982 --> 01:11:27.716
THE WATER COMPANY RELIES ON

01:11:27.783 --> 01:11:28.651
LEGITIMATE INTERESTS THE COMPANY

01:11:28.717 --> 01:11:30.953
CONDUCTS A THREE PART ANALYSIS

01:11:31.020 --> 01:11:32.655
IDENTIFYING WITH THEIR INTEREST

01:11:32.721 --> 01:11:34.056
IS LEGITIMATE MEANING IS IT

01:11:34.123 --> 01:11:35.157
LAWFUL.

01:11:35.224 --> 01:11:36.025
AND THEN WHETHER THEIR USE OF

01:11:36.091 --> 01:11:37.693
DATA IS NECESSARY IN

01:11:37.760 --> 01:11:39.294
PROPORTIONAL TO THE PURPOSE.

01:11:39.361 --> 01:11:40.896
AND FINALLY WHETHER THE RISK TO

01:11:40.963 --> 01:11:41.997
THE RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS OF THE

01:11:42.064 --> 01:11:43.599
INDIVIDUAL ARE SO HIGH THAT THEY

01:11:43.666 --> 01:11:45.167
MIGHT OUTWEIGH THE INTEREST OF

01:11:45.234 --> 01:11:46.769
THE BUSINESS.

01:11:46.835 --> 01:11:48.070
A COMPANY WILL ALSO ASK IF IT'S

01:11:48.137 --> 01:11:49.905
I'D ENGAGING IN ANY HIGH RISK

01:11:49.972 --> 01:11:51.674
PROCESSING ACTIVITIES TO THE G.

01:11:51.740 --> 01:11:53.409
P. R. REQUIRES A DATA PROTECTION

01:11:53.475 --> 01:11:55.577
IMPACT ASSESSMENT FOR ANY HIGH

01:11:55.644 --> 01:11:57.112
RISK PROCESSING ACTIVITIES.

01:11:57.179 --> 01:11:58.147
THAT CAN BE ACTIVITIES THAT

01:11:58.213 --> 01:11:59.748
INVOLVE THE COLLECTION OF SENSE

01:11:59.815 --> 01:12:01.450
OF PERSONAL DATA CAN BE

01:12:01.517 --> 01:12:03.118
PROCESSING ON A LARGE SCALE OR

01:12:03.185 --> 01:12:04.486
AUTOMATED DECISION MAKING THAT

01:12:04.553 --> 01:12:05.988
COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT OR A

01:12:06.055 --> 01:12:07.089
LEGAL A FACT.

01:12:07.156 --> 01:12:08.323
THAT COULD BE CREDIT REPORTS

01:12:08.390 --> 01:12:08.924
THAT COULD BE HOUSING

01:12:08.991 --> 01:12:11.226
DETERMINATIONS EMPLOYMENT

01:12:11.293 --> 01:12:12.194
DETERMINATIONS AND THE LIKE.

01:12:12.261 --> 01:12:13.128
COMPANIES CONDUCT THESE

01:12:13.195 --> 01:12:14.930
ASSESSMENTS THE ADJUSTER DATA

01:12:14.997 --> 01:12:16.932
PROCESSING ACTIVITIES TO REDUCE

01:12:16.999 --> 01:12:18.500
THE RISK TO INDIVIDUALS AND A

01:12:18.567 --> 01:12:19.768
DOCUMENT THEIR FINDINGS AND

01:12:19.835 --> 01:12:20.869
CONCLUSIONS.

01:12:20.936 --> 01:12:22.171
AGAIN THESE REQUIRE A THOUGHTFUL

01:12:22.237 --> 01:12:23.906
ANALYSIS AND COMPANY ULTIMATELY

01:12:23.972 --> 01:12:25.741
HAS TO BE ABLE TO JUSTIFY THE

01:12:25.808 --> 01:12:27.476
CONCLUSION THAT IT REACHES.

01:12:27.543 --> 01:12:28.610
THEN FINALLY THE COMPANY

01:12:28.677 --> 01:12:30.079
IDENTIFIES GAPS IN THEIR

01:12:30.145 --> 01:12:31.280
INTERNAL PROCESSES AND

01:12:31.346 --> 01:12:32.915
PROCEDURES THE COMPANY THE SIZE

01:12:32.981 --> 01:12:34.083
OF THEIR PRACTICES ARE

01:12:34.149 --> 01:12:35.818
SUFFICIENT TO MEET THE GDP OURS

01:12:35.884 --> 01:12:37.086
APARTMENTS.

01:12:37.152 --> 01:12:38.487
THE THIRD PHASE OF A GPR

01:12:38.554 --> 01:12:39.888
COMPLIANCE PROGRAM IS

01:12:39.955 --> 01:12:41.590
REMEDIATION AND IMPLEMENTATION.

01:12:41.657 --> 01:12:42.891
THIS IS ONE COMPANIES ACTUALLY

01:12:42.958 --> 01:12:45.127
IMPLEMENT THE CHANGESREQUIRED

01:12:45.194 --> 01:12:45.961
TO ADDRESS THE GAPS OF

01:12:46.628 --> 01:12:46.762
NO --

01:12:46.829 --> 01:12:48.397
CLOTHING IMPLEMENTING A PROCESS

01:12:48.464 --> 01:12:49.732
TO RESPOND TO THOSE DATA SUBJECT

01:12:49.798 --> 01:12:50.833
REQUEST.

01:12:50.899 --> 01:12:52.201
THIS IS REALLY WHERE THE

01:12:52.267 --> 01:12:55.070
COMPLIANCE PROGRAM SHE ORIGINAL.

01:12:55.137 --> 01:12:56.405
IT'S ONE THING TO SAY THAT

01:12:56.472 --> 01:12:57.539
YOU'RE GOING TO RAISE A

01:12:57.606 --> 01:12:58.841
CONSUMERS DATA.

01:12:58.907 --> 01:13:00.109
BUT IN ORDER TO ACTUALLY RESPOND

01:13:00.175 --> 01:13:01.276
TO INTERRACIAL REQUEST YOU NEED

01:13:01.343 --> 01:13:02.544
A MECHANISM TO VERIFY THE

01:13:02.611 --> 01:13:03.812
CONSUMER.

01:13:03.879 --> 01:13:04.580
NEED TO KNOW WHERE THE DATA

01:13:04.646 --> 01:13:05.948
STORED WHETHER YOU HAVE AN

01:13:06.014 --> 01:13:07.483
OVERRIDING NEED TO RETAIN THE

01:13:07.549 --> 01:13:08.951

INFRASTRUCTURE TO RESPONDING

01:13:11.987 --> 01:13:12.454
COMPLY WITHIN A THIRTY DAY

01:13:12.521 --> 01:13:13.288
PERIOD.

01:13:13.355 --> 01:13:14.523
A FEW OTHER TASKS HAPPENED

01:13:14.590 --> 01:13:16.759
DURING THIS PHASE ME IMPLEMENT

01:13:16.825 --> 01:13:18.427
NEW DATA SECURITY PROTOCOLS

01:13:18.494 --> 01:13:19.228
THERE'S A REQUIREMENT TO

01:13:19.294 --> 01:13:21.330
MAINTAIN A A DATA INVENTORY THAT

01:13:21.396 --> 01:13:22.965
HAS TO BE CONTINUALLY UPDATED.

01:13:23.031 --> 01:13:24.066
YOU NEED TO TRAIN YOUR EMPLOYEES

01:13:24.133 --> 01:13:25.634
AN UPDATE YOUR EXTERNAL PRIVACY

01:13:25.701 --> 01:13:27.236
POLICIES IN YOUR CONSUMER FACING

01:13:27.302 --> 01:13:28.270
LANGUAGE.

01:13:28.337 --> 01:13:29.538
COMPANIES ALSO NEED TO UPDATE

01:13:29.605 --> 01:13:31.340
THEIR THIRD PARTY AGREEMENTS AND

01:13:31.406 --> 01:13:32.508
TEMPLATE THE GPR REQUIRES

01:13:32.574 --> 01:13:34.643
COMPANIES TO CONTROL THE USE OF

01:13:34.710 --> 01:13:36.111
DATA TO PLAY CERTAIN OBLIGATIONS

01:13:36.178 --> 01:13:37.179
ON THE COMPANIES THAT PROCESS

01:13:37.246 --> 01:13:38.413
DATA ON THEIR BEHALF.

01:13:38.480 --> 01:13:39.481
AND A GOOD AMOUNT OF TIME IS

01:13:39.548 --> 01:13:41.016
ACTUALLY SPENT GOING TO THOSE

01:13:41.083 --> 01:13:43.152
NEGOTIATIONS ARE REAL COMMERCIAL

01:13:43.218 --> 01:13:44.753
IMPLICATIONS THERE.

01:13:44.820 --> 01:13:45.921
IT'S IMPORTANT UNDERSTAND ALSO

01:13:45.988 --> 01:13:47.689
THE GT R. COMPLIANCE IS NOT A

01:13:47.756 --> 01:13:49.458
FINITE PROJECT SO WHILE MAY

01:13:49.525 --> 01:13:50.826
TWENTY FIFTH WAS CHARACTERIZED

01:13:50.893 --> 01:13:51.927
THE DEADLINE.

01:13:51.994 --> 01:13:53.228
IT WASN'T REALLY A DEADLINE IT

01:13:53.295 --> 01:13:54.696
WAS JUST A MARKER OF TIME IN

01:13:54.763 --> 01:13:56.598
COMPLIANCE WITH THE GDP ARE

01:13:56.665 --> 01:13:58.433
ULTIMATELY IS AN ONGOING EFFORT.

01:13:58.500 --> 01:14:00.035
ASSESSMENTS CONDUCTED LAST YEAR

01:14:00.102 --> 01:14:01.503
MAYBE OUT OF DATE FOR SOME

01:14:01.570 --> 01:14:02.738
RECORDS ARE PROCESSING HAVE TO

01:14:02.805 --> 01:14:05.808
BE CONTINUALLY UPDATED AND RISKS

01:14:05.874 --> 01:14:07.810
NEED TO BE CONTINUALLY A FAST.

01:14:07.876 --> 01:14:09.044
THOSE IMPORTANT BUT THE G. P. R.

01:14:09.111 --> 01:14:10.846
FOR MANY COMPANIES APART A SHIFT

01:14:10.913 --> 01:14:12.514
IN THEIR BUSINESS CULTURE.

01:14:12.581 --> 01:14:13.615
THESE REGULATIONS ARE MORE THAN

01:14:13.682 --> 01:14:15.851
JUST A POLICY OR PRACTICE CHANGE

01:14:15.918 --> 01:14:17.386
FOR COMPANIES THAT AREN'T DATA

01:14:17.452 --> 01:14:19.188
FIRST COMPANIES HE'S REQUIRE

01:14:19.254 --> 01:14:20.722
HUGE INFRASTRUCTURE SHIPS

01:14:20.789 --> 01:14:23.525
ADDITIONAL RESOURCES TO SUPPORT

01:14:23.592 --> 01:14:26.662
THE COMPLIANCE EFFORT.

01:14:26.728 --> 01:14:28.597
THE NOW TURN TO THE C. CPI.

01:14:28.664 --> 01:14:29.398
KEEP IN MIND THAT THE CCPA AND

01:14:29.464 --> 01:14:30.532
THE G. P. R. TAKE A VERY

01:14:30.599 --> 01:14:32.201
DIFFERENT APPROACH TO PRIVACY

01:14:32.267 --> 01:14:33.435
AND DATA PROTECTION.

01:14:33.502 --> 01:14:35.604
THE WHILE THE GPRS FOCUS ON ALL

01:14:35.671 --> 01:14:37.039
PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA

01:14:37.105 --> 01:14:38.974
REQUIRES THAT LAWFUL BASIS FOR

01:14:39.041 --> 01:14:40.075
PROCESSING ACTIVITIES.

01:14:40.142 --> 01:14:41.777
WITH THE CPA IS FOCUSED ON THE

01:14:41.844 --> 01:14:43.345
COLLECTION AND TRANSFER OF

01:14:43.412 --> 01:14:44.479
PERSONAL DATA.

01:14:44.546 --> 01:14:45.781
THE H. GIVE INDIVIDUAL CERTAIN

01:14:45.848 --> 01:14:47.249
RIGHTS OVER THE USE OF PERSONAL

01:14:47.316 --> 01:14:49.751
DATA BUT THEY APPROACH THOSE

01:14:49.818 --> 01:14:50.552
RIGHTS DIFFERENTLY.

01:14:50.619 --> 01:14:51.486
THE COMPANIES WERE NOT SUBJECT

01:14:51.553 --> 01:14:52.855
TO THE G. P. ARE ONLY TO START

01:14:52.921 --> 01:14:55.324
FROM SCRATCH GOING TO THAT THREE

01:14:55.390 --> 01:14:56.692
PHASE PROCESS I JUST DESCRIBED.

01:14:56.758 --> 01:14:57.526
IF A COMPANY HAS IMPLEMENTED A

01:14:57.593 --> 01:15:00.896
GPR GRAHAM IT'LL BE IN A

01:15:00.963 --> 01:15:02.564
STRONGER POSITION TO BUILD A

01:15:02.631 --> 01:15:04.366
CCPA COMPLIANCE PROGRAM.

01:15:04.433 --> 01:15:05.334
BUT EVEN THOSE COMPANIES TO

01:15:05.400 --> 01:15:06.969
UPDATE THEIR PRACTICES TO COMPLY

01:15:07.035 --> 01:15:08.770
WITH THE GDP ARE THE STILL A LOT

01:15:08.837 --> 01:15:10.505
OF WORK TO BE DONE BETWEEN NOW

01:15:10.572 --> 01:15:12.541
AND TWENTY TWENTY THAT IS SO THE

01:15:12.608 --> 01:15:14.142
G. P. ARE SMALLER COMPANIES WITH

01:15:14.209 --> 01:15:15.410
FEWER RESOURCES MAY BE AT A

01:15:15.477 --> 01:15:17.779
SIGNIFICANT DISADVANTAGE AS THEY

01:15:17.846 --> 01:15:18.113
WORK TO MEET.

01:15:18.180 --> 01:15:19.581
THESE NEW OBLIGATIONS THE

01:15:19.648 --> 01:15:21.650
CHALLENGE FOR THESE COMPANIES IS

01:15:21.717 --> 01:15:22.351
THAT THEY WILL NOT BE AFFORDED

01:15:22.417 --> 01:15:23.518
THE SAME FLEXIBILITY THEY MAY

01:15:23.585 --> 01:15:25.153
HAVE BEEN GIVEN --

01:15:25.220 --> 01:15:26.855
UNDER THE GPR.

01:15:26.922 --> 01:15:28.123
SO IN TERMS OF WHAT CCPA

01:15:28.190 --> 01:15:29.558
COMPLIANCE TO ACQUIRE.

01:15:29.625 --> 01:15:31.994
AGAIN WE'LL START WITH THE DATA

01:15:32.060 --> 01:15:33.328
INVENTORY AND MAPPING PROCESS

01:15:33.395 --> 01:15:34.529
COMPANIES TO PREPARE FOR THE G.

01:15:34.596 --> 01:15:36.398
D. P. R. CAN LEVERAGE THE WORK

01:15:36.465 --> 01:15:37.666
POTENTIALLY THAT THEY DID.

01:15:37.733 --> 01:15:38.800
HOWEVER MANY COMPANIES LIMIT

01:15:38.867 --> 01:15:40.702
THEIR EFFORTS TO THE E. U.

01:15:40.769 --> 01:15:41.236
FACING PORTIONS OF THEIR

01:15:41.303 --> 01:15:42.404
BUSINESS.

01:15:42.471 --> 01:15:43.739
EVEN IF COMPANIES ENGAGED AN

01:15:43.805 --> 01:15:45.841
ENTERPRISE WIDE ASSESSMENT THE

01:15:45.908 --> 01:15:47.175
QUESTIONS THE COMPANY WILL NEED

01:15:47.242 --> 01:15:48.877
TO ASK ITSELF THAT IT WOULD NOT

01:15:48.944 --> 01:15:51.313
HAVE ASKED GOING TO THE G. P. R.

01:15:51.380 --> 01:15:51.947
PROCESS.

01:15:52.014 --> 01:15:52.981
THE COMPANIES NEED TO UNDERSTAND

01:15:53.048 --> 01:15:54.182
FIRST IF THEY COLLECT

01:15:54.249 --> 01:15:55.717
INFORMATION FROM CALIFORNIA

01:15:55.784 --> 01:15:56.885
RESIDENTS.

01:15:56.952 --> 01:15:59.221
THE GT PR IN CONTRAST HAS NO

01:15:59.288 --> 01:16:00.522
RESIDENCY REQUIREMENTS THE

01:16:00.589 --> 01:16:01.857
GRANTS PROTECTION TO ANY

01:16:01.924 --> 01:16:04.893
INDIVIDUAL LOCATED IN THE EGO.

01:16:04.960 --> 01:16:05.961
AND IT'S FAIRLY SIMPLE TO

01:16:06.028 --> 01:16:07.829
IDENTIFIES PUBLICLY ONLINE DATA

01:16:07.896 --> 01:16:09.031
WHETHER OR NOT SOMEONE'S IN THE

01:16:09.097 --> 01:16:11.333
E. U. BASED ON AN I. P. ADDRESS.

01:16:11.400 --> 01:16:13.068
BUT I. P. ADDRESSES ARE PROXY

01:16:13.135 --> 01:16:14.636
FOR YOUR PHYSICAL LOCATION NOT

01:16:14.703 --> 01:16:15.938
FOR YOUR RESIDENCY.

01:16:16.004 --> 01:16:17.606
SO FOR COMPANIES WHO DON'T SEND

01:16:17.673 --> 01:16:18.974
DIRECT MAIL FOR EXAMPLE OR IF

01:16:19.041 --> 01:16:20.208
YOU DON'T DELIVER PRODUCTS TO

01:16:20.275 --> 01:16:21.910
SOMEONE'S HOME ME ONLY HAVE AN

01:16:21.977 --> 01:16:23.345
EMAIL ADDRESS OR AN I. P.

01:16:23.412 --> 01:16:24.446
ADDRESS AND THAT WON'T CONVEY

01:16:24.513 --> 01:16:26.915
ANY INFORMATION ABOUT RESIDENCY.

01:16:26.982 --> 01:16:28.350
A COMPANY MAY IRONICALLY NEED TO

01:16:28.417 --> 01:16:29.651
COLLECT MORE INFORMATION TO TO

01:16:29.718 --> 01:16:32.854
THE MAILING ADDRESS TO DETERMINE

01:16:32.921 --> 01:16:34.222
WHERE A CONSUMER RESIDES.

01:16:34.289 --> 01:16:35.123
COMPANIES ALSO NEED TO

01:16:35.190 --> 01:16:37.025
UNDERSTAND IF THE LAW APPLIES TO

01:16:37.092 --> 01:16:38.026
THEM AND WHAT.

01:16:38.093 --> 01:16:38.927
THE G. P. R. AS WE TALKED ABOUT

01:16:38.994 --> 01:16:41.730
EARLIER DIVIDE WORLD INTO

01:16:41.797 --> 01:16:43.131
CONTROLLERS AND THE PROCESSORS

01:16:43.198 --> 01:16:44.633
AND ALLOCATE RESPONSIBILITY

01:16:44.700 --> 01:16:46.301
BASED ON THE COMPANY'S ROLE.

01:16:46.368 --> 01:16:48.370
CONTROLLER UNDER GPR WOULD BE

01:16:48.437 --> 01:16:50.072
THE BUSINESS UNDER CC PA.

01:16:50.138 --> 01:16:52.007
A PROCESSOR UNDER GPR WOULD BE

01:16:52.074 --> 01:16:53.542
THE SERVICE PROVIDER UNDER THE

01:16:53.608 --> 01:16:54.543
CPA.

01:16:54.609 --> 01:16:56.511
HOWEVER THE CCPA IS NOT AS CLEAR

01:16:56.578 --> 01:16:57.846
ABOUT THE OBLIGATIONS OF A

01:16:57.913 --> 01:16:59.114
SERVICE PROVIDER.

01:16:59.181 --> 01:17:00.882
DO WHAT TO MAYBE JUST A MISSING

01:17:00.949 --> 01:17:03.552
COMMA FROM SECTION SEVENTEEN

01:17:03.618 --> 01:17:04.886
NINETY EIGHT POINT ONE FORTY SEE

01:17:04.953 --> 01:17:06.154
ONE A VENDOR COULD BE DEEMED A

01:17:06.221 --> 01:17:07.522
BUSINESS UNDER THE LAW MERELY

01:17:07.589 --> 01:17:09.124
BECAUSE IT COLLECTS CONSUMERS

01:17:09.191 --> 01:17:10.392
PERSONAL INFORMATION.

01:17:10.459 --> 01:17:11.793
EVEN THOUGH IT'S ONLY DOING SO

01:17:11.860 --> 01:17:13.528
ON BEHALF OF THE BUSINESS.

01:17:13.595 --> 01:17:14.262
THIS IS THE POINT THAT COULD BE

01:17:14.329 --> 01:17:15.530
CLARIFIED TO COMPANIES CAN

01:17:15.597 --> 01:17:16.732
UNDERSTAND THE ROLES AND

01:17:16.798 --> 01:17:19.301
UNDERSTAND WHAT OBLIGATIONS

01:17:19.368 --> 01:17:19.968
MIGHT APPLY TO THEM.

01:17:20.035 --> 01:17:21.236
THE INVENTORY PROCESS IS ALSO

01:17:21.303 --> 01:17:22.738
IMPACTED BY THE DIFFERENCES IN

01:17:22.804 --> 01:17:24.139
THE DEFINITION OF PERSONAL

01:17:24.206 --> 01:17:25.374
INFORMATION.

01:17:25.440 --> 01:17:27.109
BOTH THE CZ P. A. AND THE G. P.

01:17:27.175 --> 01:17:28.677
R. FOR THE CONCEPT THAT DATA IS

01:17:28.744 --> 01:17:30.145
PERSONAL MONEY CAN BE USED TO

01:17:30.212 --> 01:17:31.980
EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY

01:17:32.047 --> 01:17:33.482
IDENTIFY A PERSON.

01:17:33.548 --> 01:17:34.616
BUT THE C. CPA --

01:17:34.683 --> 01:17:36.485
EXPAND THAT DEFINITION TO

01:17:36.551 --> 01:17:37.886
INCLUDE HOUSEHOLD INFORMATION

01:17:37.953 --> 01:17:39.454
AND INFORMATION THAT IS CAPABLE

01:17:39.521 --> 01:17:40.589
OF BEING ASSOCIATE WITH AN

01:17:40.655 --> 01:17:43.158
INDIVIDUAL WHICH ULTIMATELY

01:17:43.225 --> 01:17:43.725
COULD BE ANYTHING.

01:17:43.792 --> 01:17:44.659
UNDERSTANDING WHAT CONSTITUTES

01:17:44.726 --> 01:17:45.861
PERSONAL INFORMATION IS ONE OF

01:17:45.927 --> 01:17:47.662
THE COMPLIANCE CHALLENGES THE

01:17:47.729 --> 01:17:48.230
COMPANIES ARE GOING THROUGH

01:17:48.296 --> 01:17:49.765
RIGHT NOW.

01:17:49.831 --> 01:17:50.932
AND FINALLY COMPANIES NEED TO

01:17:50.999 --> 01:17:52.167
DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT THEY

01:17:52.234 --> 01:17:54.136
ARE SELLING PERSONAL DATA AS

01:17:54.202 --> 01:17:55.604
DEFINED BY THE CPA.

01:17:55.670 --> 01:17:56.571
AND I KNOW --

01:17:56.638 --> 01:17:58.106
MANY OF YOU RECEIVED AND AT YOUR

01:17:58.173 --> 01:17:59.641
FULL ON THE BROAD DEFINITION OF

01:17:59.708 --> 01:18:01.043
SALES I'M NOT GOING TO SPEND A

01:18:01.109 --> 01:18:02.744
LOT OF TIME ON THAT.

01:18:02.811 --> 01:18:03.845
BUT I WILL SAY THAT COMPLY WITH

01:18:03.912 --> 01:18:05.814
THE OBLIGATIONS WITH RESPECT TO

01:18:05.881 --> 01:18:07.115
THE SALE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION

01:18:07.182 --> 01:18:08.850
REQUIRES A COMPANY TO UNDERSTAND

01:18:08.917 --> 01:18:09.751
NOT ONLY WHETHER THEY ARE

01:18:09.818 --> 01:18:11.186
SELLING BUT THE ALSO NEED TO

01:18:11.253 --> 01:18:13.188
DETERMINE THE VALUE TO THEM OF

01:18:13.255 --> 01:18:14.256
THE DATA BEING SOLD I THINK IS A

01:18:14.322 --> 01:18:16.491
THREAT RIGHT NOW IT'S A VALUE.

01:18:16.558 --> 01:18:19.161
TO THE CONSUMER BUT THAT APPEARS

01:18:19.227 --> 01:18:20.362
TO THERE MAY NOT BE A CLEAR

01:18:20.429 --> 01:18:21.730
METRIC FOR THIS VALUATION.

01:18:21.797 --> 01:18:22.597
COMPANIES ALSO NEED TO

01:18:22.664 --> 01:18:23.999
UNDERSTAND THE CONSEQUENCES OF

01:18:24.066 --> 01:18:25.467
OPTING OUT BOTH ON THE BUSINESS

01:18:25.534 --> 01:18:27.269
AND THE CONSUMER AND WHETHER THE

01:18:27.335 --> 01:18:28.804
IMPACT ON THE CONSUMER WOULD BE

01:18:28.870 --> 01:18:30.105
DEEMED DISCRIMINATION.

01:18:30.172 --> 01:18:31.440
THESE ARE NOT ONLY LEGAL

01:18:31.506 --> 01:18:32.507
DECISIONS THEY ARE BUSINESS

01:18:32.574 --> 01:18:33.975
DECISIONS AND THEY MAY REQUIRE

01:18:34.042 --> 01:18:35.811
COMPANIES TO REEVALUATE AND

01:18:35.877 --> 01:18:37.212
CHANGE OUR BUSINESS MODELS.

01:18:37.279 --> 01:18:37.946
YOU'VE ALREADY HEARD ABOUT SOME

01:18:38.013 --> 01:18:38.880
OF THE CHALLENGES THAT ARE

01:18:38.947 --> 01:18:40.115
PRESENTED FOR COMPANIES WITH

01:18:40.182 --> 01:18:41.750
LOYALTY AND MEMBERSHIP BASED

01:18:41.817 --> 01:18:43.185
PROGRAMS.

01:18:43.251 --> 01:18:44.586
ONCE THE COMPANY COMPLETED TO

01:18:44.653 --> 01:18:46.321
MAPPING AND ASSESSMENT PHASE

01:18:46.388 --> 01:18:46.788
IT'LL NEED TO TURN TO

01:18:46.855 --> 01:18:49.424
IMPLEMENTATION. FOR CCPA THIS A

01:18:49.491 --> 01:18:50.625
LARGELY BE FOCUSED ON HOW TO

01:18:50.692 --> 01:18:51.560
PROVIDE A RESPOND TO THE

01:18:51.626 --> 01:18:52.994
INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS.

01:18:53.061 --> 01:18:54.396
AND WHILE THE C. C. P. A. N. G.

01:18:54.463 --> 01:18:56.164
P. R. OFFER A SIMILAR SET OF

01:18:56.231 --> 01:18:58.033
RATES THE CZ PA IS MORE

01:18:58.100 --> 01:18:59.734
PRESCRIPTIVE AND HOW THOSE RATES

01:18:59.801 --> 01:19:00.469
ARE DELIVERED.

01:19:00.535 --> 01:19:02.904
RESPOND UP FOCUS MY TIME ON TO

01:19:02.971 --> 01:19:04.106
FOR THE RIGHT OF ACCESS SO THE

01:19:04.172 --> 01:19:05.540
LAWS ARE FAIRLY SIMILAR WHEN IT

01:19:05.607 --> 01:19:07.309
COMES TO THE RIGHT OF ACCESS --

01:19:07.375 --> 01:19:08.877
BUT THE PROCEDURE IS DIFFERENT.

01:19:08.944 --> 01:19:10.245
THE WHILE THE GPR REQUIRES A

01:19:10.312 --> 01:19:11.680
CONTROLLERS BROUGHT TO PROVIDE

01:19:11.746 --> 01:19:14.616
AN EASILY ACCESSIBLE MECHANISM

01:19:14.683 --> 01:19:16.084
TO SUBMIT DATA SUBJECT REQUEST.

01:19:16.151 --> 01:19:18.186
THE CCPA TELLS US EXACTLY WHAT

01:19:18.253 --> 01:19:19.788
THAT MECHANISM SHOULD BE AND

01:19:19.855 --> 01:19:21.823
THAT INCLUDES PROVIDING EIGHT

01:19:21.890 --> 01:19:22.424
HUNDRED NUMBER.

01:19:22.491 --> 01:19:23.558
AND WHILE THIS NUMBER ITSELF IS

01:19:23.625 --> 01:19:25.327
FAIRLY EASY TO OBTAIN STAFFING

01:19:25.393 --> 01:19:27.062
AND TRAINING TELEPHONE OPERATORS

01:19:27.129 --> 01:19:28.563
TO RESPOND TO REQUESTS.

01:19:28.630 --> 01:19:30.232
REQUIRE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES

01:19:30.298 --> 01:19:31.299
THIS IS ALSO A CHALLENGE FOR

01:19:31.366 --> 01:19:35.270
COMPANIES WHO JUST INTERACT WITH

01:19:35.337 --> 01:19:36.404
THEIR CONSUMERS ONLINE.

01:19:36.471 --> 01:19:37.005
AND THEY ALSO PRESENT REST IN

01:19:37.072 --> 01:19:38.340
TERMS OF VERIFICATION.

01:19:38.406 --> 01:19:39.708
WITH RESPECT TO OPT OUT BOTH THE

01:19:39.774 --> 01:19:41.076
C. C. P. A. N. G. P. R. PROVIDE

01:19:41.143 --> 01:19:42.444
A RIGHT FOR INDIVIDUALS TO

01:19:42.511 --> 01:19:43.979
RESTRICT TELL COMPANY USES OUR

01:19:44.045 --> 01:19:45.347
DATA IN CERTAIN CASES.

01:19:45.413 --> 01:19:46.848
THE WHILE THE GPR DOES NOT

01:19:46.915 --> 01:19:48.717
SPECIFY HOW THIS OPT OUT IS MADE

01:19:48.783 --> 01:19:50.752
AVAILABLE THE CPA SPECIFICALLY

01:19:50.819 --> 01:19:52.387
REQUIRES A LINK TO DO NOT SOME

01:19:52.454 --> 01:19:54.122
INFORMATION ON THE HOME PAGE OF

01:19:54.189 --> 01:19:55.023
THE BUSINESS.

01:19:55.090 --> 01:19:56.691
WHICH AS DEFINED COULD BE EVERY

01:19:56.758 --> 01:19:59.661
SINGLE PAYER SO USING LANGUAGE

01:19:59.728 --> 01:20:00.829
THAT COULD BE MISUNDERSTOOD OR

01:20:00.896 --> 01:20:01.796
MISINTERPRETED BY THE AVERAGE

01:20:01.863 --> 01:20:03.665
CONSUMER.

01:20:03.732 --> 01:20:04.366
I THINK ONE OF THE KEY

01:20:04.432 --> 01:20:06.201
COMPLIANCE CHALLENGES FACED BY

01:20:06.268 --> 01:20:07.435
COMPANIES IS THAT THERE ARE SO

01:20:07.502 --> 01:20:09.371
MANY UNANSWERED QUESTIONS AT

01:20:09.437 --> 01:20:09.938
THIS POINT AND THE CLOCK IS

01:20:10.005 --> 01:20:10.705
TICKING.

01:20:10.772 --> 01:20:11.740
I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY

01:20:11.806 --> 01:20:14.176
EXPECTATION THAT THE FUNDAMENTAL

01:20:14.242 --> 01:20:15.343
REQUIREMENTS OF THIS LAW ARE

01:20:15.410 --> 01:20:16.745
GOING TO SIGNIFICANTLY HANGE

01:20:16.811 --> 01:20:18.213
BUT WE DO NOT KNOW THAT THEY'LL

01:20:18.280 --> 01:20:19.080
BE RULE MAKING FROM THE ATTORNEY

01:20:19.147 --> 01:20:20.815
GENERAL THERE WILL LIKELY BE

01:20:20.882 --> 01:20:21.283
ADDITIONAL LEGISLATIVE

01:20:21.349 --> 01:20:22.484
AMENDMENTS.

01:20:22.551 --> 01:20:23.818
AND THAT MIGHT IMPACT OF THE

01:20:23.885 --> 01:20:25.720
COMPANY'S OPERATIONALIZE THESE

01:20:25.787 --> 01:20:27.155
REQUIREMENTS YOU KNOW TAKE FOR

01:20:27.222 --> 01:20:28.089
EXAMPLE IF A COMPANY SPENDS

01:20:28.156 --> 01:20:29.424
RESOURCES NOW CREATING A

01:20:29.491 --> 01:20:31.059
CONSUMER RIGHT VERIFICATION

01:20:31.126 --> 01:20:31.860
PROGRAM.

01:20:31.927 --> 01:20:33.328
THE RULE MAKING IS ISSUED NEXT

01:20:33.395 --> 01:20:35.363
YEAR IT'S CONTRARY TO ITS PLAN

01:20:35.430 --> 01:20:37.132
IT MAY NOT HAVE TIME TO

01:20:37.199 --> 01:20:38.700
IMPLEMENT THE REQUIRED CHANGES.

01:20:38.767 --> 01:20:40.068
ONCE A G. P. R. PASSED

01:20:40.135 --> 01:20:42.237
BUSINESSES HAD TWO YEARS TO COME

01:20:42.304 --> 01:20:42.804
TO PREPARE THEIR COMPLIANCE

01:20:42.871 --> 01:20:43.972
PROGRAMS.

01:20:44.039 --> 01:20:45.507
AND WHILE THE VENN ARTICLE

01:20:45.574 --> 01:20:46.575
TWENTY NINE WORKING PARTY ISSUED

01:20:46.641 --> 01:20:48.376
GUIDANCETO HELP PROVIDE CLARITY

01:20:48.443 --> 01:20:50.445
ON SOME OF THE GRAY AREAS.

01:20:50.512 --> 01:20:53.515
IT WAS JUST THAT IT WAS RULE

01:20:53.582 --> 01:20:55.550
MAKING THAT COULD REQUIRE.

01:20:55.617 --> 01:20:57.018
UPS GETTING OUT IT WAS JUST THAT

01:20:57.085 --> 01:20:58.019
IT WAS IT WAS ITS GUIDANCE I

01:20:58.086 --> 01:20:58.653
DURING THE TO YOUR RAMP UP THERE

01:20:58.720 --> 01:20:59.854
WAS NO ADDITIONAL CHANGES IN THE

01:20:59.921 --> 01:21:01.223
LAW ITSELF OR RULE MAKING THAT

01:21:01.289 --> 01:21:03.091
COULD REQUIRE CHANGING DIRECTION

01:21:03.158 --> 01:21:04.426
AT THE LAST MINUTE. FOR ALL

01:21:04.492 --> 01:21:05.860
COMPANIES THAT ADVISOR STARTING

01:21:05.927 --> 01:21:07.529
THE MAPPING PROCESS NOW THE AND

01:21:07.596 --> 01:21:08.029
ACTUALLY NEED TO BEGIN

01:21:08.096 --> 01:21:09.931
OPERATIONALIZE IN FAIRLY QUICKLY

01:21:09.998 --> 01:21:12.267
IN ORDER TO MEET THE TWENTY

01:21:12.334 --> 01:21:13.435
TWENTY DEADLINE.

01:21:13.501 --> 01:21:14.002
SO SPEND MY REMAINING TIME

01:21:14.069 --> 01:21:15.837
DISCUSSING A FEW MODIFICATIONS

01:21:15.904 --> 01:21:17.839
TO THE C. CPA THAT COULD CLARIFY

01:21:17.906 --> 01:21:19.741
SOME THE COMPLIANCE OBLIGATIONS

01:21:19.808 --> 01:21:21.042
AND REDUCE THE RISK OF

01:21:21.109 --> 01:21:22.510
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES.

01:21:22.577 --> 01:21:24.379
THE COMPANIES ADVISE RECOGNIZE

01:21:24.446 --> 01:21:25.614
THE NEED FOR THE PARTIES

01:21:25.680 --> 01:21:26.414
PROTECTIONS I WANT TO EMPHASIZE

01:21:26.481 --> 01:21:27.849
THAT.

01:21:27.916 --> 01:21:29.618
THERE JUST STRUGGLING WITH HOW.

01:21:29.684 --> 01:21:31.186
SO FIRST OF ALL IT'S RECEIVED IN

01:21:31.253 --> 01:21:32.354
A LOT OF ATTENTION WAS MENTIONED

01:21:32.420 --> 01:21:33.955
EARLIER I DO WANT TO UNDERSCORE

01:21:34.022 --> 01:21:35.390
THE DESIRE FOR CLARITY AROUND

01:21:35.457 --> 01:21:37.092
THE INCLUSION OF HOUSEHOLD IN

01:21:37.158 --> 01:21:37.892
THE DEFINITION OF PERSONAL

01:21:37.959 --> 01:21:38.994
INFORMATION.

01:21:39.060 --> 01:21:39.928
THE WAY THAT IT'S INCORPORATED

01:21:39.995 --> 01:21:41.563
NOW CREATES A REAL RISK THAT

01:21:41.630 --> 01:21:43.365
DATA COULD END UP IN THE HANDS

01:21:43.431 --> 01:21:43.999
OF THE WRONG INDIVIDUAL.

01:21:44.065 --> 01:21:45.166
THERE APPEARS TO BE NOTHING IN

01:21:45.233 --> 01:21:46.468
THE STATUTE PREVENTING A

01:21:46.534 --> 01:21:47.902
ROOMMATE FOR EXAMPLE FROM

01:21:47.969 --> 01:21:49.604
EXERCISING A DELETION REQUEST

01:21:49.671 --> 01:21:50.739
JUST AS A PRANK.

01:21:50.805 --> 01:21:51.873
A LESSON OCULUS LEE AND

01:21:51.940 --> 01:21:53.208
ESTRANGED HUSBAND COULD EXERCISE

01:21:53.275 --> 01:21:54.309
A DATA REQUEST AND GET

01:21:54.376 --> 01:21:56.544
INFORMATION ABOUT HIS WIFE AND

01:21:56.611 --> 01:21:57.612
CHILDREN.

01:21:57.679 --> 01:21:58.546
A LEGISLATIVE AMENDMENT TO

01:21:58.613 --> 01:21:59.648
REMOVE THE REFERENCE TO

01:21:59.714 --> 01:22:01.249
HOUSEHOLD AND THE DEFINITION OF

01:22:01.316 --> 01:22:02.417
PERSONAL INFORMATION COULD

01:22:02.484 --> 01:22:03.551
PREVENT SOME OF THESE ON

01:22:03.618 --> 01:22:05.086
WARRANTED DATA DSCLOSURES

01:22:05.153 --> 01:22:06.154
WITHOUT WATERING DOWN THE LAW

01:22:06.221 --> 01:22:07.722
BECAUSE THE DEFINITIONS ARE A

01:22:07.789 --> 01:22:09.190
VERY BROAD.

01:22:09.257 --> 01:22:10.492
ALTERNATIVELY AND NOW OUR

01:22:10.558 --> 01:22:12.627
SOLUTION COULD BE TO AMEND THE

01:22:12.694 --> 01:22:13.695
LAW TO SPECIFY THAT THERE'S NO

01:22:13.762 --> 01:22:15.030
OBLIGATION TO PROVIDE THE

01:22:15.096 --> 01:22:16.064
CONSUMER WITH THE PERSONAL

01:22:16.131 --> 01:22:17.432
INFORMATION OF ANY OTHER

01:22:17.499 --> 01:22:18.667
INDIVIDUAL.

01:22:18.733 --> 01:22:19.968
EVEN IF THAT OTHER INDIVIDUAL IS

01:22:20.035 --> 01:22:23.038
A MEMBER EITHER APPROACH WOULD

01:22:23.104 --> 01:22:24.839
HELP INSURE BUSINESSES ARE ABLE

01:22:24.906 --> 01:22:25.473
TO EFFECTIVELY COMPLY WITH THIS

01:22:25.540 --> 01:22:27.575
LAW.

01:22:27.642 --> 01:22:29.077
SECOND MIGHT CONSIDER

01:22:29.144 --> 01:22:30.478
INTRODUCING THE OPPORTUNITY TO

01:22:30.545 --> 01:22:32.047
CREATE CODES OF CONDUCT --

01:22:32.113 --> 01:22:34.215
THIS IS REFLECTED IN ARTICLE

01:22:34.282 --> 01:22:35.950
FORTY FOUR I BELIEVE OF THE GPR.

01:22:36.017 --> 01:22:36.985
AS I MENTIONED THE TOP OF MY

01:22:37.052 --> 01:22:38.420
REMARKS CREATING A PRIVACY LAW

01:22:38.486 --> 01:22:39.654
THAT APPLIES ACROSS MULTIPLE

01:22:39.721 --> 01:22:41.756
INDUSTRIES AND BUSINESSES OF

01:22:41.823 --> 01:22:43.091
VARYING SIZES IS A CHALLENGE.

01:22:43.158 --> 01:22:44.592
CODE OF CONDUCT WHICH OULD BE

01:22:44.659 --> 01:22:45.960
REVIEWED AND APPROVED BY THE

01:22:46.027 --> 01:22:46.928
LEGISLATURE OR ATTORNEY

01:22:46.995 --> 01:22:48.897
GENERAL'S OFFICE WOULD ALLOW FOR

01:22:48.963 --> 01:22:49.998
ADDITIONAL CLARITY THAT WOULD

01:22:50.065 --> 01:22:52.033
TAKE INTO ACCOUNT SPECIFIC

01:22:52.100 --> 01:22:54.502
FEATURES OF CERTAIN SECTORS.

01:22:54.569 --> 01:22:55.003
AND THE NEED TO SMALLER

01:22:55.070 --> 01:22:56.571
COMPANIES.

01:22:56.638 --> 01:22:58.073
FINALLY THERE IS CONFUSION ABOUT

01:22:58.139 --> 01:22:59.007
THE TWELVE MONTH LOOK BACK

01:22:59.074 --> 01:23:01.009
PERIOD AND WHAT EXACTLY IT WILL

01:23:01.076 --> 01:23:01.776
BEGIN.

01:23:01.843 --> 01:23:03.478
BUSINESSES NEED TIME TO MAP AN

01:23:03.545 --> 01:23:05.747
ORGANIZER DATA I SPOKE EARLIER

01:23:05.814 --> 01:23:06.948
ABOUT THE FACT THAT.

01:23:07.015 --> 01:23:08.350
IT COULD BE AN MULTIPLE

01:23:08.416 --> 01:23:10.452
DATABASES VERY UNSTRUCTURED IT'S

01:23:10.518 --> 01:23:12.187
IT'S A PROCESS TO KIND OF BRING

01:23:12.253 --> 01:23:13.221
THE STATE INTO A PLACE WHERE YOU

01:23:13.288 --> 01:23:14.956
CAN EFFECTIVELY ON OF THESE

01:23:15.023 --> 01:23:16.558
THESE DATA SUBJECT REQUEST IT'S

01:23:16.624 --> 01:23:19.060
NOT THAT IT CAN'T BE DONE.

01:23:19.127 --> 01:23:19.661
BUT IT IS SOMETHING THAT TAKES

01:23:19.728 --> 01:23:20.729
TIME.

01:23:20.795 --> 01:23:22.063
AND SO WILL MAKE IN THAT COULD

01:23:22.130 --> 01:23:23.098
PROVIDE SOME CLARIFICATION THAT

01:23:23.164 --> 01:23:24.599
OF THE RULES ARE PUBLISHED UNTIL

01:23:24.666 --> 01:23:25.767
NEXT YEAR THAT REALLY LEAVES

01:23:25.834 --> 01:23:27.402
VERY LITTLE TIME TO MAP AN

01:23:27.469 --> 01:23:28.636
ORGANIZED AT THAT --

01:23:28.703 --> 01:23:30.138
DATA ACCORDING TO THE FINAL

01:23:30.205 --> 01:23:31.172
DEFINITION OF PERSONAL

01:23:31.239 --> 01:23:33.041
INFORMATION AGAIN WHICH MIGHT

01:23:33.108 --> 01:23:33.641
TAINT CHANGE ACCORDING TO RULE

01:23:33.708 --> 01:23:34.442
MAKING.

01:23:34.509 --> 01:23:35.944
SO AN AMENDMENT THAT CLARIFIES

01:23:36.010 --> 01:23:37.212
THAT TOLD MONTH LOOK BACK PERIOD

01:23:37.278 --> 01:23:38.747
WILL NOT BE AGAIN TO THE

01:23:38.813 --> 01:23:40.048
PUBLICATION OF THE ATTORNEY

01:23:40.115 --> 01:23:41.583
GENERAL'S FINAL RULES OR AT

01:23:41.649 --> 01:23:42.450
LEAST ALLOWING SOME SORT OF

01:23:42.517 --> 01:23:44.185
GRACE PERIOD FOR COMPLIANCE

01:23:44.252 --> 01:23:44.786
FOLLOWING THE PUBLICATION OF

01:23:44.853 --> 01:23:45.553
THAT RULES.

01:23:45.620 --> 01:23:47.655
WOULD ALLOW BUSINESSES TO UPDATE

01:23:47.722 --> 01:23:48.890
THEIR PRACTICES.

01:23:48.957 --> 01:23:50.191
I JUST LIKE TO CLOSE BY SAYING

01:23:50.258 --> 01:23:51.326
THAT MY COMMENTS ARE DESIGNED TO

01:23:51.393 --> 01:23:52.827
HELP INFORM THE COMMITTEE ON

01:23:52.894 --> 01:23:54.129
CHALLENGES AT BUSINESSES.

01:23:54.195 --> 01:23:55.930
YOU KNOW GOOD ACTORS IN MOST

01:23:55.997 --> 01:23:56.965
CASES WHO WANT TO FOLLOW THE

01:23:57.031 --> 01:23:58.400
RULES WILL FACE IN TRYING TO

01:23:58.466 --> 01:23:59.901
IMPLEMENT THE C. C. P.'S

01:23:59.968 --> 01:24:01.136
REQUIREMENTS.

01:24:01.202 --> 01:24:02.370
WE SHOULD THE OPPORTUNITY TO BUY

01:24:02.437 --> 01:24:04.572
THESE COMMENTS AS I SAID I THINK

01:24:04.639 --> 01:24:05.673
THERE ARE NUMBER OF OTHER PLACES

01:24:05.740 --> 01:24:06.474
THAT COULD --

01:24:06.541 --> 01:24:07.809
WHERE WE COULD USE CLARITY TO

01:24:07.876 --> 01:24:10.211
HELP --

01:24:10.278 --> 01:24:10.845
BUSINESSES EMPLOYMENT BUT I HAVE

01:24:10.912 --> 01:24:14.416

AND I'M SURE THEY'LL BE

01:24:24.759 --> 01:24:26.294
QUESTIONS AS WE GO FORWARD --

01:24:26.361 --> 01:24:28.196

AN EDUCATION AND TO PARTICIPATE

01:26:03.458 --> 01:26:05.026
IN MODERN SOCIETY.

01:26:05.093 --> 01:26:06.327
ALL OF THIS DATA MAKES THEM

01:26:06.394 --> 01:26:08.496
UNIQUELY VALUABLE TO COMPANIES

01:26:08.563 --> 01:26:09.931
AND UNIQUELY VULNERABLE TO

01:26:09.998 --> 01:26:11.833
PRIVACY HARMS.

01:26:11.900 --> 01:26:13.268
WELL ACCESS TO POWERFUL

01:26:13.334 --> 01:26:14.669
TECHNOLOGY FROM EARLY ON GIVES

01:26:14.736 --> 01:26:17.238
KIDS ACCESS TO NEW OPPORTUNITIES.

01:26:17.305 --> 01:26:19.107
IT ALSO MEANS DEVICES AT HOME AT

01:26:19.173 --> 01:26:21.075
SCHOOL AND EVER IN BETWEEN ARE

01:26:21.142 --> 01:26:21.976
CONSTANTLY.

01:26:22.043 --> 01:26:23.711
TRACKING THEM.

01:26:23.778 --> 01:26:25.847
AND THESE DEVICES CAN USUALLY BE

01:26:25.914 --> 01:26:26.548
CHEAP AND IT'S A CARE

01:26:26.614 --> 01:26:28.082
PARTICULARLY ONE ARE TALKING

01:26:28.149 --> 01:26:28.516
ABOUT A YOUNG KIDS.

01:26:28.583 --> 01:26:29.851
TôI.

01:26:29.918 --> 01:26:31.452
MILLIONS OF KIDS AND PARENTS

01:26:31.519 --> 01:26:33.154
HAVE HAD SENSITIVE INFORMATION.

01:26:33.221 --> 01:26:34.856
YOU KNOW DINNER TABLE HAT

01:26:34.923 --> 01:26:36.424
EXPOSED BY CONNECTED DEVICES

01:26:36.491 --> 01:26:39.794
TOYS TEDDY BEARS BABY CAMERAS.

01:26:39.861 --> 01:26:41.563
ADDITIONALLY AS KIDS BRAINS ARE

01:26:41.629 --> 01:26:42.897
STILL DEVELOPING THEY LAGGED

01:26:42.964 --> 01:26:44.499
BEHIND ADULTS AND

01:26:44.566 --> 01:26:45.767
CONCEPTUALIZING PRIVACY.

01:26:45.833 --> 01:26:47.602
AND UNDERSTANDING TERMS OF

01:26:47.669 --> 01:26:49.404
SERVICE AND RECOGNIZING AT YOU

01:26:49.470 --> 01:26:50.138
KNOW IF YOU THINK YOU HAVE

01:26:50.204 --> 01:26:51.673
TROUBLE READING A TERMS OF

01:26:51.739 --> 01:26:53.441
SERVICE ON YOUR CELL PHONE.

01:26:53.508 --> 01:26:54.475
GIVE IT TO A THIRTEEN YEAR OLD

01:26:54.542 --> 01:26:55.610
THERE I SAY IT MAY BE A LITTLE

01:26:55.677 --> 01:26:57.312
BETTER BUT THE WILL NOT BE ABLE

01:26:57.378 --> 01:27:00.248
TO COMPREHEND IT.

01:27:00.315 --> 01:27:01.516
MOST SCHOOL AGE KIDS CAN'T EVEN

01:27:01.583 --> 01:27:03.217
DISTINGUISH ADS FROM OTHER

01:27:03.284 --> 01:27:04.252
CONTENT.

01:27:04.319 --> 01:27:05.753
KIDS ARE PRONE TO SHARING AN

01:27:05.820 --> 01:27:07.055
IMPULSIVE BEHAVIOR AND ARE LESS

01:27:07.121 --> 01:27:08.656
ABLE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT HAPPENS

01:27:08.723 --> 01:27:10.124
TO THEIR INFORMATION IF THEY DO

01:27:10.191 --> 01:27:11.426
PUT IT OUT THERE.

01:27:11.492 --> 01:27:12.927
UNFORTUNATELY AS A STUDY

01:27:12.994 --> 01:27:14.395
CONFIRMED INFORMATION IS

01:27:14.462 --> 01:27:16.064
COLLECTED A SOUL AND REPACKAGED

01:27:16.130 --> 01:27:18.766
BY DATA BROKERS INCLUDING FOR

01:27:18.833 --> 01:27:20.935
KIDS AS YOUNG AS TWO YEARS OLD.

01:27:21.002 --> 01:27:22.036
AND I DON'T EAT THAT VICTIMS CAN

01:27:22.103 --> 01:27:23.338
BE YOU KNOW THREE MONTHS OLD I

01:27:23.404 --> 01:27:23.905
THINK IS THE YOUNGEST OF HER

01:27:23.972 --> 01:27:25.740
DEATH.

01:27:25.807 --> 01:27:27.275
COMMONSENSE ASK PARENTS ACROSS

01:27:27.342 --> 01:27:28.309
THE COUNTRY HOW THEY WANTED TO

01:27:28.376 --> 01:27:29.744
PROTECT THEIR PRIVACY RIGHTS AN

01:27:29.811 --> 01:27:31.145
WHAT TOOLS THEY THOUGHT WOULD

01:27:31.212 --> 01:27:32.580
HELP THEIR FAMILIES.

01:27:32.647 --> 01:27:34.182
MORE THAN NINE AND TEN PARENTS

01:27:34.248 --> 01:27:35.883
AND TEENS THAT IT'S IMPORTANT

01:27:35.950 --> 01:27:38.152
THAT WEBSITES CLEARLY LABEL IT

01:27:38.219 --> 01:27:40.121
DATA THEY COLLECT.

01:27:40.188 --> 01:27:41.589
AND HOW THEY WILL USE THAT DATA.

01:27:41.656 --> 01:27:43.324
AND THE SAME NUMBERS THINK IT'S

01:27:43.391 --> 01:27:44.859
IMPORTANT THAT SITES ASK

01:27:44.926 --> 01:27:47.629
PERMISSION BEFORE SELLING OR

01:27:47.695 --> 01:27:48.796
SHARING DATA.

01:27:48.863 --> 01:27:50.832
THESE USE INFORM THE VALUES THAT

01:27:50.898 --> 01:27:52.500
GUIDE OUR APPROACH IN CALIFORNIA.

01:27:52.567 --> 01:27:53.868
HE'S ACOMMONSENSE WE BELIEVE

01:27:53.935 --> 01:27:55.370
THAT KIDS NEED THE FREEDOM TO

01:27:55.436 --> 01:27:57.105
MAKE MISTAKES TO TRY NEW THINGS

01:27:57.171 --> 01:27:58.573
AND TO FIND THEIR VOICES.

01:27:58.640 --> 01:27:59.540
UNENCUMBERED BY THE LOOMING

01:27:59.607 --> 01:28:01.175
THREAT OF A PERMANENT DIGITAL

01:28:01.242 --> 01:28:02.477
RECORD THAT COULD BE USED

01:28:02.543 --> 01:28:03.778
AGAINST THEM.

01:28:03.845 --> 01:28:05.313
KIDS AND REALLY ALL OF US

01:28:05.380 --> 01:28:06.581
DESERVE A WORLD IN WHICH OUR

01:28:06.648 --> 01:28:08.016
DAILY MUSINGS OUR FRIENDS ARE

01:28:08.082 --> 01:28:09.584
NOT ASSESSED BY CORPORATIONS

01:28:09.651 --> 01:28:11.219
LOOKING TO TURN A PROFIT.

01:28:11.285 --> 01:28:11.986
BY NEFARIOUS ACTORS LOOKING TO

01:28:12.053 --> 01:28:15.790
MANIPULATE OUR DEMOCRACY.

01:28:15.857 --> 01:28:16.691
THIS IS A WORLD THAT THE

01:28:16.758 --> 01:28:18.760
CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE SOUGHT TO

01:28:18.826 --> 01:28:21.329
AVOID WITH CCPA.

01:28:21.396 --> 01:28:22.397
THE CZ PA IS THE FIRST GENERALLY

01:28:22.463 --> 01:28:24.198
APPLICABLES CONSUMER PRIVACY LAW

01:28:24.265 --> 01:28:25.566
IN AMERICA.

01:28:25.633 --> 01:28:27.368
IT IS NOT LIMITED TO FINANCIAL

01:28:27.435 --> 01:28:28.803
ARE HEALTH INFORMATION OR ANY

01:28:28.870 --> 01:28:30.238
SPECIFIC ENTITY BUT IT

01:28:30.304 --> 01:28:31.906
RECOGNIZES THAT AMERICANS HAVE

01:28:31.973 --> 01:28:33.274
PRIVACY RIGHTS AND ALL OF THEIR

01:28:33.341 --> 01:28:34.509
INFORMATION.

01:28:34.575 --> 01:28:35.943
IT COMPARES FAVORABLY TO OTHER

01:28:36.010 --> 01:28:37.912
PRIVACY LAWS ESPECIALLY IN THE

01:28:37.979 --> 01:28:39.881
U. S IN BOTH MOVING US OUT OF

01:28:39.947 --> 01:28:41.349
SECTOR SPECIFIC LAWS WHICH I

01:28:41.416 --> 01:28:42.583
THINK ARE BECOMING INCREASINGLY

01:28:42.650 --> 01:28:45.086
OUTDATED AS WE TECHNOLOGY IS.

01:28:45.153 --> 01:28:46.220
AROUND US AND EVERYTHING

01:28:46.287 --> 01:28:48.022
NOWADAYS.

01:28:48.089 --> 01:28:49.957
AND IN MOVING US BEYOND A NOTICE

01:28:50.024 --> 01:28:51.025
AND CONSENT MODEL.

01:28:51.092 --> 01:28:52.727
WHEN WE LOOK TO THE GPR HOWEVER

01:28:52.794 --> 01:28:54.962
THE CCPA COULD BE IMPROVED?

01:28:55.029 --> 01:28:57.031
BOTH IN TERMS OF GIVING

01:28:57.098 --> 01:28:58.633
CONSUMERS ADDITIONAL RIGHT AND

01:28:58.700 --> 01:29:01.002
IN TERMS OF SMALL TWEAKS. TO

01:29:01.069 --> 01:29:01.869
ENSURE THAT RATES ALREADY

01:29:01.936 --> 01:29:02.470
OFFERED.

01:29:02.537 --> 01:29:04.772
ARE REAL AND ABLE TO BE

01:29:04.839 --> 01:29:07.208
EXERCISED BY INDIVIDUALS.

01:29:07.275 --> 01:29:08.676
PROFESSOR DILATORY HAS EXPLAINED

01:29:08.743 --> 01:29:10.745
HOW PRIVACY AND DATA PROTECTIONS

01:29:10.812 --> 01:29:12.213
ARE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS IN EUROPE.

01:29:12.280 --> 01:29:13.514
AND HOW THE GPR SUPPORTS US

01:29:13.581 --> 01:29:14.982
RIGHT.

01:29:15.049 --> 01:29:17.018
IN CALIFORNIA THE RIGHT TO

01:29:17.085 --> 01:29:19.487
PRIVACY AS FUNDAMENTAL AS WELL.

01:29:19.554 --> 01:29:20.688
AND IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT THAT

01:29:20.755 --> 01:29:22.924
LAWS LIKE THIS THE CPA SUPPORT.

01:29:22.990 --> 01:29:25.093
ARTICLE ONE SECTION ONE OF THE

01:29:25.159 --> 01:29:27.028
CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION PROVIDES

01:29:27.095 --> 01:29:27.895
A CALIFORNIANS HAVE AN

01:29:27.962 --> 01:29:30.331
INALIENABLE RIGHT TO PURSUE AND

01:29:30.398 --> 01:29:31.899
OBTAIN PRIVACY.

01:29:31.966 --> 01:29:33.201
ALSO SIMILARTO EUROPE THE

01:29:33.267 --> 01:29:35.269
CALIFORNIA AND TRYING THE RIGHT

01:29:35.336 --> 01:29:35.837
TO PRIVACY IN THE NINETEEN

01:29:35.903 --> 01:29:36.571
SEVENTIES.

01:29:36.637 --> 01:29:37.939
IN RESPONSE TO FEARS OVER

01:29:38.005 --> 01:29:40.475
INCREASED SURVEILLANCE AND DATA

01:29:40.541 --> 01:29:41.843
COLLECTION BY MODERN TECHNOLOGY.

01:29:41.909 --> 01:29:43.544
SO HOW DOES THE CCPA COMPARED TO

01:29:43.611 --> 01:29:45.213
THE G. P. ARE AND WHERE COULD BE

01:29:45.279 --> 01:29:46.914
STRENGTHENED TO ENSURE IT IS

01:29:46.981 --> 01:29:48.616
SUPPORTING CALIFORNIANS

01:29:48.683 --> 01:29:51.319
INALIENABLE RIGHT TO PRIVACY.

01:29:51.385 --> 01:29:52.553
ONE MAJOR DISTINGUISHING FEATURE

01:29:52.620 --> 01:29:53.921
THAT YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT ALREADY

01:29:53.988 --> 01:29:55.456
TODAY BETWEEN THE GDP ARE IN THE

01:29:55.523 --> 01:29:56.557
C. CPI.

01:29:56.624 --> 01:29:57.992
IS THE BASELINE ASSUMPTIONS

01:29:58.059 --> 01:30:01.129
ABOUT WHAT PROCESSING IS OKAY.

01:30:01.195 --> 01:30:02.497
UNDER GPR.

01:30:02.563 --> 01:30:03.831
THE BASELINE ASSUMPTION IS THAT

01:30:03.898 --> 01:30:05.066
A COMPANY.

01:30:05.133 --> 01:30:08.035
SHOULD NOT COLLECT USE STYLE

01:30:08.102 --> 01:30:08.870
NATION.

01:30:08.936 --> 01:30:10.271
UNLESS THEY HAVE A LAWFUL BASIS

01:30:10.338 --> 01:30:12.173
FOR DOING SO.

01:30:12.240 --> 01:30:13.841
UNDER THE C. CPI THE DEFAULT

01:30:13.908 --> 01:30:15.576
RULE IS THAT IT'S OKAY FOR

01:30:15.643 --> 01:30:18.079
COMPANIES TO DO WHAT THEY WISH.

01:30:18.146 --> 01:30:19.814
UNTIL AN INDIVIDUAL SAYS NOW.

01:30:19.881 --> 01:30:21.249
AND THEN WHEN AN INDIVIDUAL CAN

01:30:21.315 --> 01:30:22.583
SAY NO.

01:30:22.650 --> 01:30:23.985
TO IS LIMITED IT TO STOP THE

01:30:24.051 --> 01:30:25.920
SALE OF THEIR DATA.

01:30:25.987 --> 01:30:27.188
COLLECTION AND USE OUR DATA

01:30:27.255 --> 01:30:29.390
MINIMIZATION ARE NOT COVERED BY

01:30:29.457 --> 01:30:30.925
THE LOT ALL.

01:30:30.992 --> 01:30:33.227
WELL THE C. CPI IS A HUGE STEP

01:30:33.294 --> 01:30:34.595
FORWARD FOR THE U. S..

01:30:34.662 --> 01:30:36.330
IT'S STILL FALL SHORT OF THE GDP

01:30:36.397 --> 01:30:38.332
ARE IN TERMS OF AVAILABLE

01:30:38.399 --> 01:30:39.400
PROTECTION.

01:30:39.467 --> 01:30:41.202
AND IT PUTS THE ONUS FOR ACTION

01:30:41.269 --> 01:30:43.371
AND FOR PROTECTION UNDER THE

01:30:43.437 --> 01:30:45.840
CONSUMER WHO HAS TO SAY NOW.

01:30:45.907 --> 01:30:46.474
USING THIS CONCEPTS OUT OF IT

01:30:46.541 --> 01:30:48.576
MORE FIRST IS THAT THE BASS LINE

01:30:48.643 --> 01:30:50.244
IS IT'S OKAY FOR COMPANIES TO DO

01:30:50.311 --> 01:30:51.345
WHAT THEY WISH.

01:30:51.412 --> 01:30:52.480
WITH DATA.

01:30:52.547 --> 01:30:54.415
COMPANIES HAVE NO REQUIREMENTS

01:30:54.482 --> 01:30:56.284
TO BUILD IN PRIVACY BY DESIGN OR

01:30:56.350 --> 01:30:57.919
TO PRACTICE DATA MINIMIZATION.

01:30:57.985 --> 01:30:59.320
THE BURDEN IS ON THE INDIVIDUAL

01:30:59.387 --> 01:31:00.321
TO OBJECT.

01:31:00.388 --> 01:31:02.156
AND I JUST APPOINT ABOUT THAT

01:31:02.223 --> 01:31:03.858
OBJECTING HEARD THAT ONE OF THE

01:31:03.925 --> 01:31:05.193
MORE PRESCRIPTIVE THINGS IN THE

01:31:05.259 --> 01:31:07.094
CALIFORNIA LAW IS THAT THERE IS

01:31:07.161 --> 01:31:11.032
THIS DO NOT SELL LINK --

01:31:11.098 --> 01:31:11.966
ONE DO NOT SELL WAS CHOSEN

01:31:12.033 --> 01:31:13.067
BECAUSE IT SHOULD BE PRETTY

01:31:13.134 --> 01:31:14.368
CLEAR TO A CONSUMER WHAT IT

01:31:14.435 --> 01:31:16.270
MEANS I'M NOT SURE IF THERE'S A

01:31:16.337 --> 01:31:17.672
MORE CLEARLY TO STATE THAT.

01:31:17.738 --> 01:31:20.174
BUT TO THE REASON THAT.

01:31:20.241 --> 01:31:21.542
IT HAS TO SAY DO NOT SELL AND IT

01:31:21.609 --> 01:31:23.010
HAS TO BE SO PRESCRIPTIVE IN

01:31:23.077 --> 01:31:24.045
THAT CASE.

01:31:24.111 --> 01:31:25.313
IS BECAUSE THE BURDEN IS ON THE

01:31:25.379 --> 01:31:27.315
INDIVIDUAL WANT TO MAKE IT AS

01:31:27.381 --> 01:31:28.850
EASY AS POSSIBLE FOR THEM TO

01:31:28.916 --> 01:31:30.885
EXERCISE THIS RIGHT.

01:31:30.952 --> 01:31:32.753
IF IF COMPANIES WANTED TO MAKE

01:31:32.820 --> 01:31:34.488
THE BURDEN ON THEM TO NOT DO

01:31:34.555 --> 01:31:35.957
ANYTHING UNTIL INDIVIDUALS THAT

01:31:36.023 --> 01:31:37.491
IT WAS OKAY THEN YOU WOULD HAVE

01:31:37.558 --> 01:31:38.926
TO HAVE THIS PRESCRIPTIVE JOSTLE

01:31:38.993 --> 01:31:39.927
REQUIREMENT.

01:31:39.994 --> 01:31:40.895
BUT SNCE THE ONUS IS ON THE

01:31:40.962 --> 01:31:42.330
INDIVIDUAL YOU WANT TO MAKE IT

01:31:42.396 --> 01:31:43.831
AS EASY AS POSSIBLE TO EXERCISE

01:31:43.898 --> 01:31:46.400
THAT.

01:31:46.467 --> 01:31:47.034
SO THIS IS DIFFERENT FROM THE G.

01:31:47.101 --> 01:31:49.170
D. P. R..

01:31:49.237 --> 01:31:51.339
ADDITIONALLY AS I MENTIONED.

01:31:51.405 --> 01:31:52.940
THE RIGHT TO OBJECT IS NOT FOR

01:31:53.007 --> 01:31:53.708
COLLECTION OR USE BUT ONLY FOR

01:31:53.774 --> 01:31:55.543
SALE.

01:31:55.610 --> 01:31:56.878
WELL SALAS INTENDED TO BE

01:31:56.944 --> 01:31:58.279
BROADLY DEFINED TO COVER

01:31:58.346 --> 01:31:59.680
SITUATIONS ARE COMPANIES ARE

01:31:59.747 --> 01:32:00.848
SHARING DATA.

EXCHANGE FOR OTHER VALUABLE

01:32:03.918 --> 01:32:05.019
CONSIDERATION.

01:32:05.086 --> 01:32:06.787
I COMPANIES PURELY INTERNAL USE

01:32:06.854 --> 01:32:08.890
OF INFORMATION IS NOT TOUCHED BY

01:32:08.956 --> 01:32:10.725
THE C. CPI.

01:32:10.791 --> 01:32:11.792
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT SELL

01:32:11.859 --> 01:32:13.327
BE DEFINED.

01:32:13.394 --> 01:32:15.129
BROADLY BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT A

01:32:15.196 --> 01:32:16.631
SITUATION WHERE COMPANIES SAYING --

01:32:16.697 --> 01:32:18.099
I DON'T SELL DATA BECAUSE I'M

01:32:18.165 --> 01:32:19.967
JUST SHARING.

01:32:20.034 --> 01:32:21.903
ACCESS TO IT IN EXCHANGE FOR

SOMETHING ELSE THAT'S THAT SEEMS

01:32:24.138 --> 01:32:25.740
LIKE SALES --

01:32:25.806 --> 01:32:27.208
IN DISCUSSING DEFAULT I WOULD BE

01:32:27.275 --> 01:32:28.576
REMISS IN NOT NOTING A CRITICAL

01:32:28.643 --> 01:32:31.178
PLACE FOR THE CCPA DOES OFFER

01:32:31.245 --> 01:32:32.780
IMPORTANT DEFAULT PROTECTIONS.

01:32:32.847 --> 01:32:34.382
AND THAT IS FOR YOUNG PEOPLE IN

01:32:34.448 --> 01:32:35.616
THIS WAY THIS EASY PAY IS LIKE

01:32:35.683 --> 01:32:36.951
THE G. P. ARE.

01:32:37.018 --> 01:32:37.952

YOU'RE UNDER THIRTEEN HOUSE TO

OPT IN BEFORE YOUR DATA CAN BE

SOLD TO A THIRD PARTY IN

01:32:49.830 --> 01:32:51.232
CALIFORNIA.

01:32:51.299 --> 01:32:52.500
G. P. R. ALSO OFFERS HEAVY

01:32:52.566 --> 01:32:53.801
PROTECTIONS FOR YOUNG PEOPLE

01:32:53.868 --> 01:32:55.903

ANOTHER PLACE FOR C. CPI IN GDP

01:33:05.146 --> 01:33:06.347
ARE THE SAME.

01:33:06.414 --> 01:33:07.782
ISN'T PROBABLY DEFINING PERSONAL

01:33:07.848 --> 01:33:09.417
INFORMATION I THINK WE'VE HEARD

01:33:09.483 --> 01:33:12.053
BOTH THE CPA IS BROADER GPR IS

01:33:12.119 --> 01:33:13.054
BROADER I THINK THEY'RE BOTH

01:33:13.120 --> 01:33:14.855
THEY'RE BOTH PRETTY BROAD

01:33:14.922 --> 01:33:15.356
DEFINITIONS OF PERSONAL

01:33:15.423 --> 01:33:16.357
INFORMATION.

01:33:16.424 --> 01:33:18.225
SO FOR DECADES CALIFORNIA CIVIL

01:33:18.292 --> 01:33:19.360
CODE HAS DEFIED PERSONAL

01:33:19.427 --> 01:33:21.062

01:33:21.128 --> 01:33:23.798

01:33:26.200 --> 01:33:27.702
ASSOCIATED WITH US.

01:33:27.768 --> 01:33:29.670
THE CCPA CONTINUES IN THIS

01:33:29.737 --> 01:33:31.005
TRADITION AND IT PROVIDES

01:33:31.072 --> 01:33:32.807
ANOTHER NUMBER OF EXAMPLES OF

01:33:32.873 --> 01:33:33.941
THINGS THAT PERSONAL INFORMATION

01:33:34.008 --> 01:33:35.576
CUT INCLUDED LIKE UNIQUE

01:33:35.643 --> 01:33:37.411
IDENTIFIERS THIS IS AFTER ALL

01:33:37.478 --> 01:33:38.980
HOW MANY COMPANIES.

01:33:39.046 --> 01:33:41.849
IDENTIFY US AND PUT US INTO

01:33:41.916 --> 01:33:42.450
VARIOUS ADVERTISING AND OTHER

01:33:42.516 --> 01:33:45.886

01:33:45.953 --> 01:33:48.456

01:33:48.522 --> 01:33:50.725
RELATING TO AN IDENTIFIED OR

01:33:50.791 --> 01:33:52.493
IDENTIFIABLE NATURAL PERSON.

01:33:52.560 --> 01:33:53.861
AND THAT IS A PERSON WHO CAN BE

01:33:53.928 --> 01:33:55.162
IDENTIFIED DIRECTLY OR

01:33:55.229 --> 01:33:58.399
INDIRECTLY GPR ALSO INCLUDES I

01:33:58.466 --> 01:34:00.234
LANDED ON A FIRE.

01:34:00.301 --> 01:34:01.769
GIVEN THAT COMPANIES CAN TELL IF

01:34:01.836 --> 01:34:03.971
WE ARE PREGNANT NOT ONLY FROM

01:34:04.038 --> 01:34:05.639
WHAT WE INPUT INTO OUR APPS.

01:34:05.706 --> 01:34:07.641
BUT FROM THE HEART RATE THAT ARE

01:34:07.708 --> 01:34:11.278
FIT BIT IS IS TRACKING ON US. TO

01:34:11.345 --> 01:34:12.980
OUR PURCHASES AT TARGET OR THEY

01:34:13.047 --> 01:34:13.848
CAN TELL WHETHER YOU'VE BEEN

01:34:13.914 --> 01:34:15.449
LAID OFF BASED ON YOUR NERGY

01:34:15.516 --> 01:34:17.685
USAGE PATTERN CHANGES ARE WHEN

01:34:17.752 --> 01:34:18.686
YOU'RE WATCHING TV.

01:34:18.753 --> 01:34:20.054
A BROAD DEFINITION OF PERSONAL

01:34:20.121 --> 01:34:21.222
INFORMATION THAT SHOULD BE

01:34:21.288 --> 01:34:23.024
PROTECTED MAKES THAT.

01:34:23.090 --> 01:34:24.458
ALL OF THAT INFORMATION IS

01:34:24.525 --> 01:34:26.327
DESERVING OF PROTECTION.

01:34:26.394 --> 01:34:28.429
AND ONE POINT WITH RESPECT TO

01:34:28.496 --> 01:34:29.764
PERSONAL INFORMATION AND

01:34:29.830 --> 01:34:30.798
HOUSEHOLD.

01:34:30.865 --> 01:34:31.732
WELL I THINK IT THE ATTORNEY

01:34:31.799 --> 01:34:33.200
GENERAL HAS A VERY IMPORTANT

01:34:33.267 --> 01:34:34.168
ROLE.

01:34:34.235 --> 01:34:35.669
IN LOOKING AT HOW HOUSEHOLD IS

01:34:35.736 --> 01:34:37.605
DEFINED AND HOW THAT WORKS IN

01:34:37.671 --> 01:34:39.507
TERMS OF EXERCISING DIFFERENT

01:34:39.573 --> 01:34:40.975
REQUESTS FOR EXAMPLE.

01:34:41.042 --> 01:34:42.276
I HAVE LESS OF A CONCERN THAT MY

01:34:42.343 --> 01:34:44.145
ROOMMATE IS GOING TO OUT ME OUT

01:34:44.211 --> 01:34:45.413
OF OF YOU KNOW.

01:34:45.479 --> 01:34:47.748
INFORMATION SELLING SOMEWHERE IN

01:34:47.815 --> 01:34:48.249
THAT WOULD BE A TERRIBLE

01:34:48.315 --> 01:34:49.283
DETRIMENT TO ME.

01:34:49.350 --> 01:34:50.551
IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE COVER

01:34:50.618 --> 01:34:52.019
HOUSEHOLDS BECAUSE THAT IS HOW

01:34:52.086 --> 01:34:53.954
COMPANIES PROFILE FAMILIES AND

01:34:54.021 --> 01:34:54.955
KIDS.

01:34:55.022 --> 01:34:56.090
THERE WAS A TIME WHEN COMPANIES

01:34:56.157 --> 01:34:57.925
SAID THAT A TELEPHONE NUMBER WAS

01:34:57.992 --> 01:34:59.193
NOT PERSONAL INFORMATION BECAUSE

01:34:59.260 --> 01:34:59.927
IT WASN'T LINKED TO AN

01:34:59.994 --> 01:35:01.328
INDIVIDUAL IT WAS LINKED TO THE

01:35:01.395 --> 01:35:02.797
FAMILY HOME.

01:35:02.863 --> 01:35:03.697
WE DON'T WANT THE SAME TO BE

01:35:03.764 --> 01:35:05.332
TRUE FOR SMART TV'S AND FOR

01:35:05.399 --> 01:35:07.234
THERMOSTATS SO WE NEED TO THINK

01:35:07.301 --> 01:35:09.670
OF A WAY. TO INCLUDE HOUSEHOLD

01:35:09.737 --> 01:35:11.272
AND TO INCLUDE IT SMARTLY

01:35:11.338 --> 01:35:11.572
[inaudible]

01:35:11.639 --> 01:35:13.407
SO.

01:35:13.474 --> 01:35:15.042
WHILE THE CCPA DOES HAVE THIS

01:35:15.109 --> 01:35:16.110
BROAD DEFINITION OF PERSONAL

01:35:16.177 --> 01:35:17.211
INFORMATION.

01:35:17.278 --> 01:35:18.746
IT DOES NOT EXTEND DATA SECURITY

01:35:18.813 --> 01:35:19.847
REQUIREMENTS TO ALL OF THIS

01:35:19.914 --> 01:35:21.415
INFORMATION.

01:35:21.482 --> 01:35:22.950
AND TO THIS EXTENT IT DOES NOT

01:35:23.017 --> 01:35:25.086
GO AS FAR AS THE G. D. P. R..

01:35:25.152 --> 01:35:27.688
C. CPA'S DATA BREACH PROVISIONS

01:35:27.755 --> 01:35:29.123
ONLY COVER AND NARROW SWATH OF

01:35:29.190 --> 01:35:30.391
PERSONAL INFORMATION LARGELY

01:35:30.458 --> 01:35:33.160
CABIN TO FINANCIAL MEDICAL

01:35:33.227 --> 01:35:34.662
SOCIAL SECURITY TYPE INFORMATION.

01:35:34.728 --> 01:35:36.764
SO INTO MY CONVERSATIONS BETWEEN

01:35:36.831 --> 01:35:38.032
A PARENT AND A CHILD OVERSEE

01:35:38.099 --> 01:35:40.701
MENTAL HEALTH CONCERN HOMEWORK

01:35:40.768 --> 01:35:42.203
PULLING.

01:35:42.269 --> 01:35:44.205
A VIDEO RECORDING FROM A BEDROOM.

01:35:44.271 --> 01:35:46.340
IF THAT WAS BREACHED.

01:35:46.407 --> 01:35:46.974
YOU DON'T HAVE A RIGHT UNDER THE

01:35:47.041 --> 01:35:47.675
SEA CPA.

01:35:47.741 --> 01:35:48.542
THE NARROWNESS OF THIS DATA

01:35:48.609 --> 01:35:50.478
SECURITY BREACH PROVISION

01:35:50.544 --> 01:35:52.012
REQUIREMENT IS INTERESTING.

01:35:52.079 --> 01:35:53.481
BECAUSE THE BRIDGE PROVISIONS

01:35:53.547 --> 01:35:54.849
HAS DRAWN A LOT OF ATTENTION.

01:35:54.915 --> 01:35:56.383
PRESUMABLY BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE

01:35:56.450 --> 01:35:57.685
THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION IS

01:35:57.751 --> 01:35:58.752
ATTACHED.

01:35:58.819 --> 01:36:00.187
AND MISTER RETIRED EXPLAINED HOW

01:36:00.254 --> 01:36:02.623
OF THERE'S A NAG THERE'S THIS

01:36:02.690 --> 01:36:04.291
PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION.

01:36:04.358 --> 01:36:06.093
SO THIS BRINGS ME TO A FINAL WAY

01:36:06.160 --> 01:36:08.062
THAT THE CCPA FALL SHORT IN

01:36:08.129 --> 01:36:09.530
COMPARISON TO THE G. P. R. FOR

01:36:09.597 --> 01:36:10.865
CONSUMERS AND THAT IS IN

01:36:10.931 --> 01:36:12.299
ENFORCEMENT.

01:36:12.366 --> 01:36:13.934
THE CZ PA DOES HAVE THIS PRIVATE

01:36:14.001 --> 01:36:15.069
RIGHT OF ACTION.

01:36:15.136 --> 01:36:17.705
BUT IT'S ONLY FOR NEGLIGENT DATA

01:36:17.771 --> 01:36:19.006
SECURITY BREACH US.

01:36:19.073 --> 01:36:20.908
THE GPR HAS A PRIVATE RIGHT OF

01:36:20.975 --> 01:36:22.309
ACTION ACROSS THE BOARD.

01:36:22.376 --> 01:36:23.444
IT ALLOWS FOR INDIVIDUALS TO

01:36:23.511 --> 01:36:25.579
BRING CLAIMS INCLUDING FOR NON

01:36:25.646 --> 01:36:27.381
MATERIAL DAMAGES LIKE HARM AND

01:36:27.448 --> 01:36:29.383
DISTRESS.

01:36:29.450 --> 01:36:30.918
IT ALLOWS ADVOCACY GROUPS TO

01:36:30.985 --> 01:36:32.286
BRING ACTIONS ON BEHALF OF

01:36:32.353 --> 01:36:34.488
CONSUMERS.

01:36:34.555 --> 01:36:35.489
AND HAS SERIOUS FINANCIAL

01:36:35.556 --> 01:36:37.424
PENALTIES INDEED THESE PENALTIES

01:36:37.491 --> 01:36:39.026
ARE MUCH OF WHAT MAY COMPANIES

01:36:39.093 --> 01:36:41.195
SET UP AND COMPLY.

01:36:41.262 --> 01:36:42.630
BECAUSE A NUMBER OF GDP.

01:36:42.696 --> 01:36:44.832
REQUIREMENTS EXISTED PREVIOUSLY

01:36:44.899 --> 01:36:46.300
BUT THERE WAS NO REAL FINANCIAL

01:36:46.367 --> 01:36:46.600
[inaudible]

01:36:46.667 --> 01:36:48.969
FINANCIAL DETERRENCE. TO THE C.

01:36:49.036 --> 01:36:50.538
CPI WITH ITS VERY LIMITED

01:36:50.604 --> 01:36:52.439
PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION MAY NOT

01:36:52.506 --> 01:36:54.308
SERVE THE SAME TO TURN.

01:36:54.375 --> 01:36:55.976
FUNCTION AS THE G. D. P. R. AND

01:36:56.043 --> 01:36:57.411
IF COMPANIES ARE DETERRED THAN

01:36:57.478 --> 01:36:59.547
CONSUMERS WILL NOT ENJOY REAL

01:36:59.613 --> 01:37:01.081
PROTECTIONS UNDER THE LAW.

01:37:01.148 --> 01:37:02.750
CONSUMERS ARE NOT ALONE HERE AND

01:37:02.816 --> 01:37:04.185
WANTING MORE PROTECTIONS THE

01:37:04.251 --> 01:37:05.219
ATTORNEY GENERAL WHO'S TOSSED

01:37:05.286 --> 01:37:06.520
WITH ENFORCING THIS LAW IN

01:37:06.587 --> 01:37:07.688
ADDITION TO IMPLEMENTING

01:37:07.755 --> 01:37:08.956
REGULATIONS.

01:37:09.023 --> 01:37:10.858
HAS STATED IT CONCERNS ABOUT

01:37:10.925 --> 01:37:12.793
RESOURCES AND HAS ASKED THAT A

01:37:12.860 --> 01:37:13.694
PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION BE

01:37:13.761 --> 01:37:16.096
EXPANDED.

01:37:16.163 --> 01:37:17.965
WELL THE CCPA DOES REPRESENT A

01:37:18.032 --> 01:37:19.600
NEW OFFER COMPANIES SO I WOULD

01:37:19.667 --> 01:37:21.302
NOTE IT DOES NOT APPLY TO ALL

01:37:21.368 --> 01:37:22.803
COMPANIES ON LIKE THE G. P. R.

01:37:22.870 --> 01:37:24.405
EVEN ALL ENTITIES LIKE NON

01:37:24.471 --> 01:37:25.472
PROFITS AND GOVERNMENTS THERE IS

01:37:25.539 --> 01:37:28.542
A CARVE OUT FOR SMALL BUSINESSES.

01:37:28.609 --> 01:37:30.110
IT CONTAINS MANY SIMILAR

01:37:30.177 --> 01:37:32.112
PROVISION TO THE G. P. R..

01:37:32.179 --> 01:37:33.781
AND AS I'VE DISCUSSED IT DOES

01:37:33.847 --> 01:37:35.416
NOT HAVE ALL OF THEM INCLUDING

01:37:35.482 --> 01:37:37.218
OF VARIOUS BUREAUCRATIC AND

01:37:37.284 --> 01:37:38.953
RECORD KEEPING REQUIREMENTS.

01:37:39.019 --> 01:37:40.054
WELL I WOULDN'T ASK TO HAVE ALL

01:37:40.120 --> 01:37:41.388
THOSE BROUGHT TO THE U. S. I

01:37:41.455 --> 01:37:43.123
WOULD SUPPORT PROFESSOR DILATORY

01:37:43.190 --> 01:37:43.791
IS.

01:37:43.857 --> 01:37:45.826
A INTEREST IN HAVING DEDICATED

01:37:45.893 --> 01:37:48.295
AND TRAIN PRIVACY PROFESSIONALS --

01:37:48.362 --> 01:37:49.897
TO ENSURE THAT CONSUMERS ARE

01:37:49.964 --> 01:37:51.031
PROTECTED I DON'T THINK THAT'S

01:37:51.098 --> 01:37:53.300
THE SORT OF THING THAT YOU WANT

01:37:53.367 --> 01:37:53.901
TO WRITE IN OUR NEED TO WRITE

01:37:53.968 --> 01:37:54.935
INTO US LAW.

01:37:55.002 --> 01:37:55.803
AS YOU CAN --

01:37:55.869 --> 01:37:58.439
THE CCPA COMPARED TO OTHER LAWS

01:37:58.505 --> 01:37:58.939
AND ITS WORKABILITY FOR

01:37:59.006 --> 01:37:59.807
COMPANIES.

01:37:59.873 --> 01:38:01.508
AFTER YOU ALSO CONSIDER HOW IT

01:38:01.575 --> 01:38:03.143
COMPARES FOR CONSUMERS AND WHAT

01:38:03.210 --> 01:38:04.378
ITS WORKABILITY IS FOR

01:38:04.445 --> 01:38:05.246
CALIFORNIANS [inaudible]

01:38:05.312 --> 01:38:08.682
THANK YOU.

01:38:08.749 --> 01:38:10.951
VERY MUCH OF VERY INTERESTING

01:38:11.018 --> 01:38:14.255
PERSPECTIVES AND CERTAINLY --

01:38:14.321 --> 01:38:16.824
WORTHY OF LOTS OF CONSIDERATION

01:38:16.890 --> 01:38:17.591
I CHANGED.

01:38:17.658 --> 01:38:19.693
I HAVE --

01:38:19.760 --> 01:38:24.798
ONE QUESTIONED OF FOR MISLEAD

01:38:24.865 --> 01:38:28.502
POSTED WE HEAR A LOT THAT --

01:38:28.569 --> 01:38:30.237
BY USING.

01:38:30.304 --> 01:38:33.073
A BY CREATING C. C. P. R. AS HE

01:38:33.140 --> 01:38:35.542
SHOULD BE A RATHER --

01:38:35.609 --> 01:38:36.777
WE ARE --

01:38:36.844 --> 01:38:38.212
GOING TO DESTROY THE BUSINESS

01:38:38.279 --> 01:38:39.380
MODEL OF COMPANIES THAT

01:38:39.446 --> 01:38:40.781
COMPANIES ARE GOING TO GO OUT OF

01:38:40.848 --> 01:38:42.650
BUSINESS I THINK A MR MCTAGGART

01:38:42.716 --> 01:38:45.252
POINTED OUT THAT IN THE FIFTIES

01:38:45.319 --> 01:38:46.520
THE AUTOMOBILE INDUSTRY.

01:38:46.587 --> 01:38:48.222
FAST THAT WE WERE DESTROYING

01:38:48.289 --> 01:38:49.923
THEIR THEIR BUSINESS MODEL BY

01:38:49.990 --> 01:38:51.959
CALLING FOR SAFETY AND TOBACCO

01:38:52.026 --> 01:38:54.261
AND HE LEFT OUT THE OIL INDUSTRY

01:38:54.328 --> 01:38:55.963
THAT'S ANOTHER ONE AND IN TRYING.

01:38:56.030 --> 01:38:57.898
TO CREATE RENEWABLES BUT I WOULD

01:38:57.965 --> 01:38:59.633
BE REMISS ON BEHALF OF MY

01:38:59.700 --> 01:39:00.534
COMMUNITIES --

01:39:00.601 --> 01:39:04.705
NOT TO POINT TO THE OIL INDUSTRY --

01:39:04.772 --> 01:39:07.908
BUT I'M WONDERING THE FACT THAT

01:39:07.975 --> 01:39:09.176
COMPANIES.

01:39:09.243 --> 01:39:10.811
HAVE ALREADY GOT A COMPLY WITH

01:39:10.878 --> 01:39:12.446
G. D. P. R. --

01:39:12.513 --> 01:39:14.415
THE FACT THAT WE NOW HAVE IN

01:39:14.481 --> 01:39:17.584
CALIFORNIA THIS THIS REGULATION

01:39:17.651 --> 01:39:19.053
A COMPANIES THAT ARE.

01:39:19.119 --> 01:39:21.322
OF COMPLYING OR TRYING TO COMPLY

01:39:21.388 --> 01:39:22.823
WITH GDP ARE ARE THEY ATA

01:39:22.890 --> 01:39:27.561
DISADVANTAGE OR ARE THEY IN FACT --

01:39:27.628 --> 01:39:28.495
THAT HAVE SORT OF A LEG UP.

01:39:28.562 --> 01:39:30.164
IN THE EFFORTS TO COMPLY WAS

01:39:30.230 --> 01:39:33.400
CCPA BECAUSE THEY ARE ALREADY

01:39:33.467 --> 01:39:35.135
WORKING TOWARDS COMPLIANCE WITH

01:39:35.202 --> 01:39:38.672
A DIFFERENT BUT PERHAPS IN MANY

01:39:38.739 --> 01:39:41.375
WAYS MORE STRINGENT --

01:39:41.442 --> 01:39:42.776
SET OF REQUIREMENTS.

01:39:42.843 --> 01:39:44.144
SURE AND AND IT'S GOING TO

01:39:44.211 --> 01:39:46.113
DEPEND IS THE AS I MENTIONED NOT

01:39:46.180 --> 01:39:47.281
EVERY COMPANY --

01:39:47.348 --> 01:39:48.349
FIRST WILL NOT EVERY COMPANY

01:39:48.415 --> 01:39:50.584
SUBJECT TO SEE CPA WAS SUBJECT

01:39:50.651 --> 01:39:52.553
TO DUTY PR FOR THE COMPANIES WHO

01:39:52.619 --> 01:39:53.187
ARE AND THEY'RE STARTING FROM

01:39:53.253 --> 01:39:54.054
SCRATCH.

01:39:54.121 --> 01:39:55.622
OTHER COMPANIES WHO DID TAKE

01:39:55.689 --> 01:39:57.124
STEPS TO THE EXTENT THAT THEY

01:39:57.191 --> 01:39:58.092
YOU KNOW CONDUCTED THOSE

01:39:58.158 --> 01:39:59.860
ENTERPRISE WIDE ASSESSMENT AND I

01:39:59.927 --> 01:40:01.195
DO THINK THAT'S WHERE A LOT OF

01:40:01.261 --> 01:40:02.830
THE LEG WORK TAKES PLACE IT'S

01:40:02.896 --> 01:40:03.664
REALLY --

01:40:03.731 --> 01:40:05.366
YOU KNOW WHEN YOU KIND OF GET

01:40:05.432 --> 01:40:05.966
INTO THE WEEDS OF THE COMPANY

01:40:06.033 --> 01:40:08.535
AND IN WHICH DATA IS COLLECTED I

01:40:08.602 --> 01:40:10.003
MEAN IMAGINE A COMPANY THAT

01:40:10.070 --> 01:40:11.505
INITIALLY STARTED SELLING YOU

01:40:11.572 --> 01:40:13.607
KNOW WIDGETS AND THEN YOU KNOW

01:40:13.674 --> 01:40:14.908
SELLING THINGS HEART LIKE.

01:40:14.975 --> 01:40:16.610
THE MAIL BECAME OBSOLETE INTO

01:40:16.677 --> 01:40:18.345
NOW THEY HAVE IT NOW THEY HAVE A

01:40:18.412 --> 01:40:20.180
A DIGITAL PLATFORM MAYBE THEY'VE

01:40:20.247 --> 01:40:21.548
ACQUIRED SOME COMPANIES.

01:40:21.615 --> 01:40:23.250
THOSE KIND OF COMPANIES HAVE

01:40:23.317 --> 01:40:24.618
LOTS OF DIFFERENT DATABASES THEY

01:40:24.685 --> 01:40:25.419
HAVE DIFFERENT OWNERS AND

01:40:25.486 --> 01:40:26.887
STAKEHOLDERS AND SO THE PROCESS

01:40:26.954 --> 01:40:28.756
JUST TO KIND OF COLLECT AND

01:40:28.822 --> 01:40:29.690
FIGURE OUT WHAT INFORMATION WE

01:40:29.757 --> 01:40:31.625
HAVEHOW WE USING IT ACROSS THE

01:40:31.692 --> 01:40:32.459
COMPANY.

01:40:32.526 --> 01:40:33.494
IF THEY WEREN'T REQUIRED TO KIND

01:40:33.560 --> 01:40:34.561
OF ENGAGE IN THAT ASSESSMENT

01:40:34.628 --> 01:40:36.830
BEFORE IT JUST TAKES TIME TO

01:40:36.897 --> 01:40:38.332
KIND OF GO THROUGH THAT PROCESS.

01:40:38.399 --> 01:40:40.234
A SO FOR COMPANIES WHO DID THAT

01:40:40.300 --> 01:40:41.735
PROCESS FOR THE G. P. R. I DO

01:40:41.802 --> 01:40:43.170
THINK THAT THEY ARE.

01:40:43.237 --> 01:40:45.406
OF YOU KNOW FAR ALONG THE WAY OF

01:40:45.472 --> 01:40:46.273
THE PROCESS LIKE I SAID THERE

01:40:46.340 --> 01:40:47.608
ARE OTHER QUESTIONS THAT THEY

01:40:47.674 --> 01:40:49.076
NEED TO ANSWER HERE --

01:40:49.143 --> 01:40:50.978
BUT HAVING GONE THROUGH SOME OF

01:40:51.044 --> 01:40:52.846
THE GDP OUR PROCESS I THINK DOES

01:40:52.913 --> 01:40:54.148
PUT YOU AT AN ADVANTAGE.

01:40:54.214 --> 01:40:55.883
AND I DON'T KNOW THAT.

01:40:55.949 --> 01:40:57.518
YOU KNOW COMPANIES WILL GO OUT

01:40:57.584 --> 01:40:58.886
OF BUSINESS I THINK THAT A

01:40:58.952 --> 01:41:00.821
DEPEND ON THE SIZE BUT I DO

01:41:00.888 --> 01:41:01.889
THINK YOU HAVE KIND OF TWO

01:41:01.955 --> 01:41:03.290
CONSIDERATIONS IS TO KEEP IN

01:41:03.357 --> 01:41:03.957
MIND.

01:41:04.024 --> 01:41:05.426
YOU KNOW REGULATIONS LIKE THIS

01:41:05.492 --> 01:41:07.327
ALWAYS FAVOR OF LARGER COMPANIES

01:41:07.394 --> 01:41:08.729
WHO HAVE MORE RESOURCES SUCH

01:41:08.796 --> 01:41:10.364
JUST A FACT OF THE MATTER SO THE

01:41:10.431 --> 01:41:12.065
BIGGER YOU ARE THE EASIER IT IS

01:41:12.132 --> 01:41:12.933
FOR YOU.

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:14.334
TO COMPLY AND PIVOT OR TAKE THE

01:41:14.401 --> 01:41:16.370
RISK IN SOME CASES OF LAWSUITS

01:41:16.437 --> 01:41:18.038
BECAUSE THAT MIGHT BE BUILT INTO

01:41:18.105 --> 01:41:19.139
YOUR BUSINESS MODEL.

01:41:19.206 --> 01:41:21.408
AND I I DO THINK THAT WITH THIS

01:41:21.475 --> 01:41:24.211
AND YOU KNOW THE SUPPLIES ACROSS

01:41:24.278 --> 01:41:24.745
THE BOARD TO A NUMBER OF

01:41:24.812 --> 01:41:25.412
INDUSTRIES.

01:41:25.479 --> 01:41:27.314
BUT IT'S CLEAR THAT THE DESIRE

01:41:27.381 --> 01:41:29.216
HERE IS IS TO ADDRESS THE

01:41:29.283 --> 01:41:30.918
SITUATION OF DATA BEING SHARED

01:41:30.984 --> 01:41:31.819
ONLINE.

01:41:31.885 --> 01:41:35.656
AND I THINK IT IS THE

01:41:35.722 --> 01:41:37.558
ADVERTISING I THINK THEY WERE

01:41:37.624 --> 01:41:41.328
HIT WELL AND YOU SAW A LOT OF

01:41:41.395 --> 01:41:41.962
THOSE COMPANIES PULLING OUT OF

01:41:42.029 --> 01:41:42.996
THE ISSUE.

01:41:43.063 --> 01:41:44.364
A LOT OF TARGETED ADVERTISING

01:41:44.431 --> 01:41:46.200
AND ONLINE ADVERTISING HAS BEEN

01:41:46.266 --> 01:41:48.535
REDUCED AND I DID YOU KNOW AND

01:41:48.602 --> 01:41:50.237
AND THE IO REGULATORS HATE --

01:41:50.304 --> 01:41:51.605
THE CONCEPT OF THE AD SUPPORTED

01:41:51.672 --> 01:41:53.340
INTERNET AND SO YOU KNOW THEY'RE

01:41:53.407 --> 01:41:55.342
NOT PARTICULARLY INTERESTED IN

01:41:55.409 --> 01:41:56.543
AND AND THAT BUSINESS BUT HERE

01:41:56.610 --> 01:41:58.278
WE'VE SUPPORTED IT AND I THINK

01:41:58.345 --> 01:42:00.280
CONSUMERS DO GET A BENEFIT FROM.

01:42:00.347 --> 01:42:01.982
VISITING SITES AND NOT HAVING TO

01:42:02.049 --> 01:42:04.852
PAY FOR I MEAN I'M I UNDERSTAND

01:42:04.918 --> 01:42:05.486
THAT THE BALANCE I THINK LIKE I

01:42:05.552 --> 01:42:05.886
SAID.

01:42:05.953 --> 01:42:06.954
COMPANIES UNDERSTAND THE NEED TO

01:42:07.020 --> 01:42:08.322
BE A BALANCE OF PRIVACY BUT IT'S

01:42:08.388 --> 01:42:10.324
IMPORTANT TO KEEP IN MIND THAT

01:42:10.390 --> 01:42:12.226
SOME OF THOSE MODELS WILL SHIFT

01:42:12.292 --> 01:42:12.726
BASED ON HOW THE LAW IS

01:42:12.793 --> 01:42:14.995
CONSTRUCTED [inaudible]

01:42:15.062 --> 01:42:18.699
END OF SOLD SOME OF THE MODELS

01:42:18.765 --> 01:42:19.933
WILL SHIP --

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:20.701
ARE.

01:42:20.767 --> 01:42:24.004
IS I UNDERSTAND IT MOST OF THE

01:42:24.071 --> 01:42:26.440
COLLECTION OF DATA COMES FROM

01:42:26.507 --> 01:42:29.076
THESE BIGGER ENTITIES --

01:42:29.142 --> 01:42:30.711
THAT COULD WHERE PEOPLE TEND TO

01:42:30.777 --> 01:42:33.113
DO MORE BUSINESS PLATFORMS LIKE.

01:42:33.180 --> 01:42:35.482
FACEBOOK FOR EXAMPLE IN ONE OF

01:42:35.549 --> 01:42:37.117
THINGS I DON'T KNOW WHAT.

01:42:37.184 --> 01:42:38.519
NEITHER SENATOR DODD NOTION OR

01:42:38.585 --> 01:42:39.052
STERN WE'RE HERE AT THE

01:42:39.119 --> 01:42:40.554
BEGINNING AND PERHAPS YOU KNOW

01:42:40.621 --> 01:42:42.055
THIS BUT ONE OF THE MOST

01:42:42.122 --> 01:42:44.157
OUTRAGEOUS MISUSES OF

01:42:44.224 --> 01:42:45.325
INFORMATION --

01:42:45.392 --> 01:42:46.994
WAS DISCUSSED AND I JUST HAVE TO

01:42:47.060 --> 01:42:48.829
REPEAT IT BECAUSE I CAN'T THINK

01:42:48.896 --> 01:42:51.131
OF ANYTHING MORE OF A IN THE

01:42:51.198 --> 01:42:53.800
VIOLATING OF ONE'S PRIVACY --

01:42:53.867 --> 01:42:56.703
THAN THIS EXAMPLE IS FOR THE

01:42:56.770 --> 01:43:00.374
FITBIT TO GET PREGNANT WE'LL

01:43:00.440 --> 01:43:02.042
PROVIDE PUT INTO THE FITBIT

01:43:02.109 --> 01:43:02.943
THERE'RE --

01:43:03.010 --> 01:43:04.411
MENSTRUAL CYCLE.

01:43:04.478 --> 01:43:06.747
AND THE FITBIT WILL TELL THEM

01:43:06.813 --> 01:43:08.515
WHEN THEY ARE OVULATING.

01:43:08.582 --> 01:43:10.417
THAT INFORMATION UNBEKNOWNST TO

01:43:10.484 --> 01:43:12.452
THESE WOMEN IS BEING TRANSMITTED

01:43:12.519 --> 01:43:14.321
AS WE SPEAK TO FACEBOOK.

01:43:14.388 --> 01:43:16.023
THEY ARE ACTUALLY ACQUIRING THAT

01:43:16.089 --> 01:43:17.424
INFORMATION WITHOUT THE

01:43:17.491 --> 01:43:19.326
PERMISSION OR THE KNOWLEDGE OR

01:43:19.393 --> 01:43:22.262
CONSENT OF THESE WOMEN WHO ARE

01:43:22.329 --> 01:43:24.731
USING THE FITBIT.

01:43:24.798 --> 01:43:26.166
TO PERHAPS A SYSTEM IN.

01:43:26.233 --> 01:43:27.834
FINDING OUT YOU KNOW HAVING MORE

01:43:27.901 --> 01:43:29.036
INFORMATION ABOUT WHEN THEY

01:43:29.102 --> 01:43:30.904
POPULATED IN THE DESIRE TO HAVE

01:43:30.971 --> 01:43:33.206
CHILDREN AND MY POINT WAS AND I

01:43:33.273 --> 01:43:35.342
THINK THIS IS REALLY TRUE IF YOU

01:43:35.409 --> 01:43:36.677
DON'T WANT YOUR MOTHER TO KNOW --

01:43:36.743 --> 01:43:37.678
THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO HAVE

01:43:37.744 --> 01:43:38.812
CHILDREN WHY IN THE WORLD WOULD

01:43:38.879 --> 01:43:40.447
YOU WANT FACEBOOK OR SOME OTHER

01:43:40.514 --> 01:43:41.515
STRANGER TO HAVE THAT

01:43:41.582 --> 01:43:42.683
INFORMATION.

01:43:42.749 --> 01:43:44.217
AND I THINK THAT FOR THE YOUNG

01:43:44.284 --> 01:43:45.819
WOMEN HERE OR FOR THE MOTHERS

01:43:45.886 --> 01:43:47.421
AND GRANDMOTHERS WHEN WE ALWAYS

01:43:47.487 --> 01:43:48.622
WANT TO KNOW SO ALL.

01:43:48.689 --> 01:43:50.490
IN ALL -- WE

01:43:50.557 --> 01:43:52.593
WE THE CHILDREN WILL TELL YOU

01:43:52.659 --> 01:43:53.727
WHEN THEY'RE READY TO TELL YOU

01:43:53.794 --> 01:43:56.096
ANYA FACEBOOK IS GONNA KNOW THAT.

01:43:56.163 --> 01:43:58.231
AND ISN'T THAT SOMETHING THAT IS

01:43:58.298 --> 01:44:01.335
JUST BEYOND THE PALE --

01:44:01.401 --> 01:44:01.902
IN SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO

01:44:01.969 --> 01:44:05.572
ADDRESS A CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA AS

01:44:05.639 --> 01:44:07.608
WELL AS ANOTHER SO --

01:44:07.674 --> 01:44:09.476
I I I THINK THAT THAT IS

01:44:09.543 --> 01:44:10.243
CRITICALLY IMPORTANT AS WE DID

01:44:10.310 --> 01:44:12.245
YOU WANNA RESPONSE JUST RESPOND

01:44:12.312 --> 01:44:13.547
TO THAT QUICKLY I I I DO WANT TO

01:44:13.614 --> 01:44:14.948
NOTE THAT THE LAW DOESN'T

01:44:15.015 --> 01:44:16.416
DISTINGUISH I THINK WE TALK

01:44:16.483 --> 01:44:17.551
ABOUT THESE EXAMPLES.

01:44:17.618 --> 01:44:18.719
NOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS

01:44:18.785 --> 01:44:19.953
TYPICALLY INVOLVES SENSITIVE

01:44:20.020 --> 01:44:22.389
DATA HEALTH DATA FINANCIAL DATA

01:44:22.456 --> 01:44:24.358
OR VULNERABLE CLASSES LIKE

01:44:24.424 --> 01:44:26.126
CHILDREN FOR EXAMPLE --

01:44:26.193 --> 01:44:27.894
FOR INVOLVES THE HARM CAUSED BY

01:44:27.961 --> 01:44:30.163
THAT DATA AND THOSE ISSUES ARE

01:44:30.230 --> 01:44:31.365
PARTICULARLY ADDRESS THERE'SNO

01:44:31.431 --> 01:44:32.532
KIND OF DISTINCTION BETWEEN

01:44:32.599 --> 01:44:33.734
PERSONAL INFORMATION THAT IS

01:44:33.800 --> 01:44:35.369
SENSITIVE AND JUST KIND OF RUN

01:44:35.435 --> 01:44:36.536
OF THE MILL PERSON INFORMATION

01:44:36.603 --> 01:44:37.771
THAT MIGHT HAVE.

01:44:37.838 --> 01:44:39.172
YOU KNOW LESS OF AN IMPACT ON AN

01:44:39.239 --> 01:44:40.407
INDIVIDUAL --

01:44:40.474 --> 01:44:42.442
SO I THINK IT MIGHT BE HELPFUL

01:44:42.509 --> 01:44:43.844
TO CREATE A DISTINCTION THERE

01:44:43.910 --> 01:44:45.379
MIGHT BE DIFFERENT LEVELS OF

01:44:45.445 --> 01:44:46.613
PROTECTION THAT ARE REQUIRED

01:44:46.680 --> 01:44:48.815
WHEN DATA IS EITHER SENSITIVE OR

01:44:48.882 --> 01:44:50.550
IT STARTS OFF YOU KNOW AS AN

01:44:50.617 --> 01:44:51.752
EMAIL ADDRESS AND THEN CENTS A

01:44:51.818 --> 01:44:53.020
PIECE OF THE DATE ARE APPENDED

01:44:53.086 --> 01:44:53.720
TO IT BECAUSE I THINK.

01:44:53.787 --> 01:44:55.222
THAT THAT THAT YOU'RE CONCERNED

01:44:55.288 --> 01:44:56.189
I DON'T THINK ANYONE WOULD

01:44:56.256 --> 01:44:57.691
DISAGREE THAT YOU KNOW YOUR

01:44:57.758 --> 01:44:58.792
HEALTH INFORMATION I'M A

01:44:58.859 --> 01:45:00.060
CONSUMERS WHILE I DON'T WANT MY

01:45:00.127 --> 01:45:01.628
HEALTH INFORMATION SHARED WITH A

01:45:01.695 --> 01:45:03.363
THIRD PARTY WITHOUT MY KNOWLEDGE.

01:45:03.430 --> 01:45:04.765
OF AND SO I THINK THAT IS THAT

01:45:04.831 --> 01:45:05.465
THE VALID THAT'S A VALID

01:45:05.532 --> 01:45:07.200
CONSIDERATION I WILL SAY ALSO

01:45:07.267 --> 01:45:08.168
THAT.

01:45:08.235 --> 01:45:10.604
YES BIG COMPANIES ARE THE

01:45:10.671 --> 01:45:12.039
CONSUMER FACING CO OR AND MANY

01:45:12.105 --> 01:45:13.407
CASES BIG COMPANIES ARE THE

01:45:13.473 --> 01:45:15.342
CONSUMER FACING COMPANIES BUT

01:45:15.409 --> 01:45:17.377
THE AD TECH ECOSYSTEM IS A

01:45:17.444 --> 01:45:18.478
MASSIVE ECOSYSTEM THERE ARE

01:45:18.545 --> 01:45:20.013
NUMBER OF THIRD PARTY PLAYERS

01:45:20.080 --> 01:45:21.815
THAT ARE OPERATING --

01:45:21.882 --> 01:45:22.582
AND I KNOW THAT'S PART OF THE

01:45:22.649 --> 01:45:24.351
ISSUE AGAIN BRINGING LIGHT --

01:45:24.418 --> 01:45:26.153
BUT IT'S NOT JUST SORT OF THESE

01:45:26.219 --> 01:45:27.721
BIG COMPANIES I THINK THE LAWS

01:45:27.788 --> 01:45:28.822
ADDRESSED TO THEM BUT HAS

01:45:28.889 --> 01:45:30.357
IMPLICATIONS FOR A NUMBER OF

01:45:30.424 --> 01:45:31.925
SMALLER COMPANIES AS WELL.

01:45:31.992 --> 01:45:34.194
AGAIN FOR IT FOCUSES THOUGH ON

01:45:34.261 --> 01:45:35.762
THE CONSUMER RIGHTS --

01:45:35.829 --> 01:45:37.197
AND WOOD AS WE WERE TALKING WE

01:45:37.264 --> 01:45:38.498
NEED TO BALANCE SOME BUT I THINK

01:45:38.565 --> 01:45:40.667
THE CONSUMER RIGHTS AS A MATTER

01:45:40.734 --> 01:45:41.802
OF PUBLIC POLICY.

01:45:41.868 --> 01:45:47.574
ARE THE CONCERN SHOULD BE THE

01:45:47.641 --> 01:45:48.942
CONCERN.

01:45:49.009 --> 01:45:53.046
I SET THE SO I'M HOPING YOU.

01:45:53.113 --> 01:45:55.215
TO JOKE --

01:45:55.282 --> 01:45:56.483
ABOUT A ABOUT A YEAR.

01:45:56.550 --> 01:45:57.584
YOU AND I LAUGHED A LOT ABOUT

01:45:57.651 --> 01:45:58.985
THE DEAL MARKET FOR JEWISH

01:45:59.052 --> 01:46:00.520
MOTHERS PAYING FOR THEIR SON IN

01:46:00.587 --> 01:46:03.290
LAWS YOU FOR THEIR DAUGHTER IN

01:46:03.356 --> 01:46:04.925
LAWS -- YOU

01:46:04.991 --> 01:46:06.460
KNOW OF INFORMATION.

01:46:06.526 --> 01:46:07.561
THAT THAT I'M SURE THERE'S A

01:46:07.627 --> 01:46:08.829
MARKET THERE SO --

01:46:08.895 --> 01:46:10.664
SO ALL THE MORE REASON TO

01:46:10.731 --> 01:46:12.432
PREVENT IT FROM --

01:46:12.499 --> 01:46:13.900
FROM -- FROM

01:46:13.967 --> 01:46:15.001
FROM FROM BEING ALLOWED TO BE

01:46:16.103 --> 01:46:18.205
EXTRAORDINARY AND AND AND I I I

01:46:31.017 --> 01:46:31.651
THERE'S JUST THERE'S A LINE THAT

01:46:31.718 --> 01:46:32.986
THAT HAS BEEN CROSS OVER AND

01:46:33.053 --> 01:46:34.488

EUROPE I KNOW THERE'S BEEN DATA

01:47:05.685 --> 01:47:06.186

ARE BAD AS I THE THE PROTECTION

01:47:46.226 --> 01:47:48.395
LITTLE EDIE'S FUNDAMENTAL FOR

01:47:48.461 --> 01:47:51.064
THE UT THE EUROPEAN PERSPECTIVE --

01:47:51.131 --> 01:47:58.338
IN TERMS OF ENFORCEMENT THE YOU

QUE THEY AYE SEAL.

01:48:00.040 --> 01:48:01.341
WAS REALLY.

01:48:01.408 --> 01:48:03.009
INVOLVED IN THE WHOLE SITUATION

01:48:03.076 --> 01:48:04.611
WITH CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA IN THE

01:48:04.678 --> 01:48:05.879
U. K. --

01:48:05.946 --> 01:48:07.547
FROM THE BEGINNING I KNOW THAT

01:48:07.614 --> 01:48:09.583
MANY OF THE RESOURCES HAVE BEEN

01:48:09.649 --> 01:48:11.184
USED -- TO

01:48:11.251 --> 01:48:14.688
INVESTIGATE THE SITUATION --

01:48:14.754 --> 01:48:16.122
OBVIOUSLY.

01:48:16.189 --> 01:48:17.824
FROM THAT THE THE PROTECTION

01:48:17.891 --> 01:48:19.226
RESPECT BETWEEN YOUR OF THE

AGAINST THE LAW IT'S NOT.

01:48:24.531 --> 01:48:26.933
M. EVEN THE QUESTION RIGHT WE

THAT THAT WAS.

01:48:34.341 --> 01:48:35.508
UNDER YOU BEING LOW ON AN

01:48:35.575 --> 01:48:37.177
ETHICAL USE OF THE THAT AND

IN EUROPE AND AND I SAY SENIOR

01:48:46.720 --> 01:48:48.655
SAYING THAT IT WASN'T

01:48:48.722 --> 01:48:49.189
NECESSARILY CANCEL HEARING

01:48:49.256 --> 01:48:49.589
ANSWER [inaudible]

01:48:49.656 --> 01:48:52.425
WELL.

01:48:52.492 --> 01:48:54.828
YOU KNOW THAT I THAT IS A BIG

01:48:54.895 --> 01:48:55.929
SUBJECT RIGHT BUT I DON'T KNOW

01:48:55.996 --> 01:48:56.963
OF ANY PRIVACY LAW THAT WAS

01:48:57.030 --> 01:48:59.232
VIOLATED BY THE CONDUCT --

01:48:59.299 --> 01:49:00.500
IN THE U. S. THEM THERE ARE MANY

01:49:00.567 --> 01:49:02.068
LOS I'M NOT AWARE OF SO THERE

01:49:02.135 --> 01:49:05.872
MIGHT BE OTHER LAWS HE WAS --

01:49:05.939 --> 01:49:06.740
ONE OF THE LOS THAT WAS

01:49:06.806 --> 01:49:08.275
IDENTIFYING EURO BEST A LAW THAT

01:49:08.341 --> 01:49:10.677
HAD BEING VIOLATED AND I HAVE.

01:49:10.744 --> 01:49:13.280
THE THURMOND.

01:49:13.346 --> 01:49:14.915
CONSEQUENCES OF THAT.

01:49:14.981 --> 01:49:17.083
ARE QUITE INTERESTING ONE OF THE

01:49:17.150 --> 01:49:33.099
THINGS THAT WE DON'T.

01:49:33.166 --> 01:49:37.938
GENERALLY REALIZE FROM THE U. K.

01:49:38.004 --> 01:49:39.973
U. S. PERSPECTIVE IS THAT.

01:49:40.040 --> 01:49:41.074
BECAUSE UPS THINK THESE

01:49:41.141 --> 01:49:43.610
FUNDAMENTAL VIEW APPROACH ABOUT

01:49:43.677 --> 01:49:46.046
THE THE PROTECTION.

01:49:46.112 --> 01:49:56.489
THE FACT THAT CAN REGIONAL LEGAL

01:49:56.556 --> 01:49:59.092
TO A BY BY THEIR LOSS REGARDLESS

01:49:59.159 --> 01:50:00.627
OF WHETHER THEY HAVE THE THOUGH

01:50:00.694 --> 01:50:02.562
IF YOU THE ANSWER NOT.

01:50:02.629 --> 01:50:03.596
SO -- MAN

01:50:03.663 --> 01:50:04.965
FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF YOU KNOW

01:50:05.031 --> 01:50:05.799
THEIR ACTIVITIES --

01:50:05.865 --> 01:50:07.500
DEFINITELY THEY WERE AGAINST THE

01:50:07.567 --> 01:50:10.303
LAW ALL OF THE U. K. AT THE TIME.

01:50:10.370 --> 01:50:14.708
AND THE THE OUTCOME IS LIKELY

01:50:14.774 --> 01:50:16.076
THAT THEY WILL YOU KNOW

01:50:16.142 --> 01:50:32.292
DISAPPEAR

01:50:36.629 --> 01:50:38.999
AS AN ORGANIZATION.

01:50:39.065 --> 01:50:42.602
IF I CAN USE A JOKE THAT I HAVE

01:50:42.669 --> 01:50:44.904
USED IN THE PAST TO KIND OF

01:50:44.971 --> 01:50:48.475
HIGHLIGHTS FROM MY STUDENTS IS --

01:50:48.541 --> 01:50:49.843
USUALLY A CONDO WITH OUR LEGAL

01:50:49.909 --> 01:50:50.877
CLEARLY IN EUROPE I'M NOT SURE

01:50:50.944 --> 01:50:52.112
THAT IT WAS CLEARLY A LEGAL IN

01:50:52.178 --> 01:50:57.917
THE YES SAY OKAY LET ME OPEN THE

01:50:57.984 --> 01:50:59.686
FILE HE SAYS HERE MARCH FIFTH

01:50:59.753 --> 01:51:01.221
YOU WERE.

01:51:01.287 --> 01:51:03.823
FOUND BY THE POLICE AND YOU WERE --

01:51:03.890 --> 01:51:05.925
TAKEN TO THE PRESENT AND YOUR

01:51:05.992 --> 01:51:07.293
LACK OF RESULTED --

01:51:07.360 --> 01:51:09.329
US POSITIVE OF METHAMPHETAMINE I

01:51:09.396 --> 01:51:10.397
SAID ALL YES YES I WAS USING

01:51:10.463 --> 01:51:11.931
METHAMPHETAMINE.

01:51:11.998 --> 01:51:14.334
UNDIGESTED BUT YOU'RE PLEADING

01:51:14.401 --> 01:51:15.635
NOT GUILTY.

01:51:15.702 --> 01:51:16.770
TO CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES THAT HE

01:51:16.836 --> 01:51:16.970
SAID.

01:51:17.037 --> 01:51:18.405
WELL.

01:51:18.471 --> 01:51:19.839
METHAMPHETAMINE IS NOT UNDER

01:51:19.906 --> 01:51:21.875
CONTROL.

01:51:21.941 --> 01:51:23.176
THE POINT IS THAT ONE THING IS

01:51:23.243 --> 01:51:24.844
TO PROHIBIT THE CONDUCT.

01:51:24.911 --> 01:51:26.279
I WENT A DIFFERENT THING IS TO

01:51:26.346 --> 01:51:28.314
AVOID THE COMBO PRICE SO WITH

01:51:28.381 --> 01:51:29.115
THESE CLEAR TO ME IS THAT THE IN

01:51:29.182 --> 01:51:30.583
EUROPE THE CONDO WAS PRETTY WITH

01:51:30.650 --> 01:51:31.818
THAT.

01:51:31.885 --> 01:51:33.753
IT WAS NOT A BOY THAT ARMS NOT

01:51:33.820 --> 01:51:37.157
AVOIDED THE IT THAT I CAN BE

01:51:37.223 --> 01:51:39.292
JULY THE HAD ALSO --

01:51:39.359 --> 01:51:40.894
ANY FINANCING BREXIT.

01:51:40.960 --> 01:51:42.395
AND SO THAT IT'S CLEAR THAT HE

01:51:42.462 --> 01:51:46.866
ALSO TO PLEASE REGARDING

01:51:46.933 --> 01:51:48.601
EUROPEAN ELECTION RIGHT

OKAY HARD TO PUT YOUR ARMS

01:51:52.872 --> 01:52:01.714
AROUD AND THIS IS I I GIVE

01:52:01.781 --> 01:52:03.516
THEIR ATTENTION.

01:52:03.583 --> 01:52:05.251
SENATOR STERN DID YOU HAVE A

01:52:05.318 --> 01:52:07.554
QUESTION FOLLOWED BY VICE CHAIR.

01:52:07.620 --> 01:52:08.988
QUESTION NOT A JOKE ALTHOUGH I

01:52:09.055 --> 01:52:10.790
KNOW THIS IS.

01:52:10.857 --> 01:52:14.394
ALL ABOUT JOKES --

01:52:14.461 --> 01:52:17.797
WHAT IS SINCE MAY THE GPR ROEG'S

01:52:17.864 --> 01:52:18.998
TOOK AFFECT WHAT'S THE HOW MUCH

01:52:19.065 --> 01:52:19.599
IS THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION

01:52:19.666 --> 01:52:22.035
BEEN UTILIZED AS AN ENFORCEMENT

01:52:22.102 --> 01:52:23.436
MECHANISM SO THAT'S?

01:52:23.503 --> 01:52:24.204
THAT'S AN OPEN QUESTION THERE

01:52:24.270 --> 01:52:25.805
HAS BEEN A LOT OF HIGHLIGHTED

01:52:25.872 --> 01:52:27.774
OVER THE SAY THE OTHER JEEP YOUR

01:52:27.841 --> 01:52:29.576
OCCURRENCE OF PRIVATE RIGHT THE

01:52:29.642 --> 01:52:30.910
FUNCTION EAST THROUGH --

01:52:30.977 --> 01:52:33.446
BUT YOU HAVE TO REALIZE THAT AND

01:52:33.513 --> 01:52:35.582
YOUR HOUSE NOT BEING HARMONIZING

01:52:35.648 --> 01:52:37.650
THE SAME WITH THE U. S. CLASPING

01:52:37.717 --> 01:52:38.985
HER WAY SO YOU IT DOESN'T HAVE A

01:52:39.052 --> 01:52:39.552
FEDERAL COURT.

01:52:39.619 --> 01:52:41.087
SO ALL OF THESE PRIVATE RIGHTS

01:52:41.154 --> 01:52:42.422
WILL HAVE TO BE FOUGHT AND WON

01:52:42.489 --> 01:52:43.523
OVER THE RIGHTS OF THE

01:52:43.590 --> 01:52:44.390
INDEPENDENT COUNTRIES.

01:52:44.457 --> 01:52:46.226
SO FOR EXAMPLE YOU WILL MY HALF

01:52:46.292 --> 01:52:53.133
ACCORDING IS BEING DECIDED THAT.

01:52:53.199 --> 01:52:56.202
A PERSON DOESN'T HAVE A SPENDING

01:52:56.269 --> 01:52:57.237
EARLY TO EVALUATE WHAT THE

01:52:57.303 --> 01:52:59.639
RESULT IS GOING TO BE OF THESE

01:52:59.706 --> 01:53:01.241
PRIVATE RIGHT THE FACTION BUT

01:53:01.307 --> 01:53:03.243
THESE DEFINITELY ENABLE BY GDP

01:53:03.309 --> 01:53:04.844
ARE WE JUST DON'T KNOW HOW IT'S

01:53:04.911 --> 01:53:06.513
GOING TO PLAY OUT.

01:53:06.579 --> 01:53:08.381
YOU HAVE ANY SENSE QUANTITY WISE

01:53:08.448 --> 01:53:08.948
THE OF HOW MANY FILINGS HAVE

01:53:09.015 --> 01:53:09.549
BEEN.

01:53:09.616 --> 01:53:11.284
MADE OVERALLS ANYONE SORT OF

01:53:11.351 --> 01:53:12.585
TRACKING THAT BUT I AM NOT AWARE

01:53:12.652 --> 01:53:13.920
OF ANYBODY THAT HAS BEEN

01:53:13.987 --> 01:53:15.889
TRACKING THAT.

01:53:15.955 --> 01:53:18.358
CASO BUT WHEN IT SAYS AT IN OUR

01:53:18.424 --> 01:53:20.927
BACK REMEMBRANCES A PRIVATE

01:53:20.994 --> 01:53:22.529
RIGHT OF ACTION IT IN AN

01:53:22.595 --> 01:53:24.197
UNDERSEA CPA LIMITED TO DATA

01:53:24.264 --> 01:53:26.933
BREACHES ONLY BUT THAT IT JUST

01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:28.501
SAYS YES FOR GDP ARE YOU'RE

01:53:28.568 --> 01:53:29.969
SAYING THIS THIS QUESTION IS

01:53:30.036 --> 01:53:32.105
STANDING IN JURISDICTION.

01:53:32.172 --> 01:53:33.873
THE END UP AS THE PRIVATE

01:53:33.940 --> 01:53:34.541
COLLECTION I JUST DON'T KNOW HOW

01:53:34.607 --> 01:53:36.576
EFFECTIVE THE PRIVATE RIGHT THE

01:53:36.643 --> 01:53:38.211
FUNCTION IS GOING TO BE IN TERMS

01:53:38.278 --> 01:53:39.946
OF ACTUALLY --

01:53:40.013 --> 01:53:41.781
DRIVING OUTCOMES FOR THE

01:53:41.848 --> 01:53:42.982
PLAINTIFFS BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO

01:53:43.049 --> 01:53:44.684
THE PAIN OF THE PROCEDURAL RULES

01:53:44.751 --> 01:53:48.254
OF THE IN DEFENDING COUNTRIES

01:53:48.321 --> 01:53:49.222
THAT FORM THE EUROPEAN UNION.

01:53:49.289 --> 01:53:49.689
SO IN OTHER WORDS THE

01:53:49.756 --> 01:53:52.192
LIMITATIONS MAY NOT BE OBVIOUS

01:53:52.258 --> 01:53:53.693
BUT THEY'LL BE DICTATED BASED ON

01:53:53.760 --> 01:53:58.031
THE THE SORT OF WAY HOWEVER THE

01:53:58.097 --> 01:53:59.899
CIVIL PROCEDURE WORKS IN

01:53:59.966 --> 01:54:01.301
WHATEVER THAT PARTICULAR NATION

01:54:01.367 --> 01:54:03.002
IS THAT'S RIGHT HOW THE

01:54:03.069 --> 01:54:04.237
GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE WORKS

01:54:04.304 --> 01:54:05.138
AREN'T SEXY HOT THE WHAT I

01:54:05.205 --> 01:54:06.806
ANTICIPATE IS THAT BECAUSE WE WE

01:54:06.873 --> 01:54:07.006
HAVE.

01:54:07.073 --> 01:54:08.308
THE SAME CHALLENGE HERE WITH

01:54:08.374 --> 01:54:11.377
PRIVATE RIGHT DIFFICULT TO PROVE

01:54:11.444 --> 01:54:13.413
THAT MATCHES AND THAT HAS BEEN

01:54:13.479 --> 01:54:15.848
AN EFFECTIVE BUT WE YEAR TO AB

01:54:15.915 --> 01:54:16.149
[inaudible]

01:54:16.216 --> 01:54:19.085
YES -- AND

01:54:19.152 --> 01:54:20.587
EFFECTIVE --

01:54:20.653 --> 01:54:22.589
RESTRAIN ON THE ABILITY OF

01:54:22.655 --> 01:54:25.692
INDIVIDUALS TO ACTUALLY --

01:54:25.758 --> 01:54:27.160
OF THE NEW POSITIVE OUTCOMES

01:54:27.227 --> 01:54:29.963
WHEN THE APPROVED AS TO FOR A

01:54:30.029 --> 01:54:31.731
PRIVACY VIOLATION I THINK THAT

01:54:31.798 --> 01:54:33.666
WE MIGHT FIND THE SAME THING AT

01:54:33.733 --> 01:54:35.602
THE EUROPEAN LEVEL BUT IT IS

01:54:35.668 --> 01:54:37.637
REALLY DIFFICULT FOR ME TWENTY

01:54:37.704 --> 01:54:38.238
SIMPLY BECAUSE I ONLY KNOW THE

01:54:38.304 --> 01:54:40.173
LOSS OF HIS BEING QUITE HONESTLY.

01:54:40.240 --> 01:54:41.140
AND THE IT COULD WORK IN VERY

01:54:41.207 --> 01:54:44.210
DIFFERENT WAYS FROM THE

01:54:44.277 --> 01:54:47.046
DIFFERENT JURISDICTIONS.

01:54:47.113 --> 01:54:49.115
CAN I GET YOU BY MISTAKE THANK

01:54:49.182 --> 01:54:49.916
YOU FOR AND THIS IS IN --

01:54:49.983 --> 01:54:50.583
ABOUT PRIVATE RIGHT BUT I BUT WE

01:54:50.650 --> 01:54:51.451
HAVE HEARD THAT HUNDREDS OF

01:54:51.517 --> 01:54:52.252
COMPLAINTS HAVE BEEN FILED WITH

01:54:52.318 --> 01:54:54.020
THE DATA PROTECTION AUTHORITIES

01:54:54.087 --> 01:54:55.288
AND I THINK THAT'S A CHANNEL

01:54:55.355 --> 01:54:56.990
THAT A LOT OF INDIVIDUALS ARE

01:54:57.056 --> 01:54:57.557
GOING THERE IS A WHAT WE'VE

01:54:57.624 --> 01:54:58.491
HEARD IS THAT.

01:54:58.558 --> 01:55:00.526
WHAT THEY'RE DOING NOW IS GOING

01:55:00.593 --> 01:55:01.194
THROUGH EVALUATING THOSE

01:55:01.261 --> 01:55:02.595
COMPLAINTS AND WE EXPECT TO SEE

01:55:02.662 --> 01:55:04.230
ENFORCEMENT TAKE PLACE OVER THE

01:55:04.297 --> 01:55:06.499
COURSE OF THIS YEAR AS A KIND OF?

01:55:06.566 --> 01:55:07.433
GO THROUGH ALL THE DIFFERENT

01:55:07.500 --> 01:55:08.534
COMPLAINTS HAVE BEEN FILED SO MY

01:55:08.601 --> 01:55:10.737
AT MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT MANY

01:55:10.803 --> 01:55:12.505
OF THE ISSUES ARE BEING DEALT

01:55:12.572 --> 01:55:14.274
WITH THAT THE DPA LEVEL.

01:55:14.340 --> 01:55:16.276
BUT THE G. P. R. DID GIVE WHAT

01:55:16.342 --> 01:55:18.478
IS SIMILAR TO THE OTHER A CLASS

01:55:18.544 --> 01:55:19.412
ACTION I DON'T THINK THERE

01:55:19.479 --> 01:55:20.580
REALLY IS A CONCEPT OF CLASS

01:55:20.647 --> 01:55:22.282
ACTION PREVIOUSLY IN THE EO BUT

01:55:22.348 --> 01:55:23.549
IT DID GIVE THIS CONCEPT OF

01:55:23.616 --> 01:55:25.151
BRINGING A COLLECTIVE ACTION

01:55:25.218 --> 01:55:26.019
UNDER THE DTP ARE.

01:55:26.085 --> 01:55:27.220

ACTION LIKE THAT AND FILE WITH

01:55:49.142 --> 01:55:50.443

01:55:59.319 --> 01:56:01.554
THEY CAN HAPPEN IN HIGHER LOW.

01:56:01.621 --> 01:56:03.089
OKAY.

01:56:03.156 --> 01:56:05.925
THE HISTORICALLY MOST OF THE

01:56:05.992 --> 01:56:06.893
COMPLAINTS FOR THE THE POSITION

01:56:06.959 --> 01:56:07.760
BY LESIONS HAVE GONE THROUGH THE

01:56:07.827 --> 01:56:09.262
DATA PROTECTION AUTHORITIES AND

01:56:09.329 --> 01:56:09.862

THAT IS AN OPTION AS WELL THEY

01:56:31.884 --> 01:56:32.218
CAN GO THROUGH --

01:56:32.285 --> 01:56:32.719
THE MORE ADMINISTRATIVE

01:56:32.785 --> 01:56:35.388

I'M I'M JUST GOING TO ADD LITTLE

01:56:43.129 --> 01:56:45.131
THING TO THAT SO THE UPN RIGHT

01:56:45.198 --> 01:56:46.799
TO THE THE PROTECTION THAT THESE

01:56:46.866 --> 01:56:48.868
IN THE CONSTITUTION EQUIVALENT

01:56:48.935 --> 01:56:49.869
OF THE BILL OF RIGHTS.

01:56:49.936 --> 01:56:51.104
ACTUALLY SAYS THAT YOU HAVE A

01:56:51.170 --> 01:56:52.438
RIGHT TO HAVE AN INDEPENDENT

01:56:52.505 --> 01:56:54.374
AUTHORITY THAT WILL LOOK AT YOUR

01:56:54.440 --> 01:56:55.975
COMPLAINTS WILL RAISE AN ISSUE

01:56:56.042 --> 01:56:56.709
THAT HAS TO DO WITH IT

01:56:56.776 --> 01:56:58.244
OPERATIONS SO THAT IS GRANTED ON

01:56:58.311 --> 01:57:00.913
EUROPEANS AND THERE'S ALWAYS

01:57:00.980 --> 01:57:04.150
THAT THE RECORDS.

01:57:04.217 --> 01:57:05.284
TO THANK AMENITIES.

01:57:05.351 --> 01:57:06.552
OF BEING --

01:57:06.619 --> 01:57:08.254
A FRESHMAN OF LEGISLATOR IF

01:57:08.321 --> 01:57:10.156
YOU'LL MY COLLEAGUES WILL OBLIGE

01:57:10.223 --> 01:57:13.292
ME ON SOME THESE BASIC IMPACT

01:57:13.359 --> 01:57:14.727
THAT THAT --

01:57:14.794 --> 01:57:16.295
THIS LEGISLATION IS GOING TO

01:57:16.362 --> 01:57:19.165
HAVE ON BUSINESSES AND I ASKED

01:57:19.232 --> 01:57:20.666
IF ANYONE COULD QUANTIFY OR

01:57:20.733 --> 01:57:22.969
PROJECT OUT SOME.

01:57:23.035 --> 01:57:25.605
SOME QUANTIFIABLE DATA ON HOW

01:57:25.671 --> 01:57:28.474
MANY BUSINESSES WILL GO UNDER

01:57:28.541 --> 01:57:30.276
FOR SOMETHING LIKE THIS AND OF

01:57:30.343 --> 01:57:30.910
COURSE I'VE NOT YET SEEN

01:57:30.977 --> 01:57:31.944
ANYTHING.

01:57:32.011 --> 01:57:34.213
ABOUT THAT BUT IF WE WERE TO USE

01:57:34.280 --> 01:57:35.648
AN EXAMPLE OF LET'S SAY A

01:57:35.715 --> 01:57:37.483
RETAILER.

01:57:37.550 --> 01:57:38.985
IN A RETAILER.

01:57:39.051 --> 01:57:40.520
GATHERS DATA --

01:57:40.586 --> 01:57:42.855
AND THAT RETAILERS THE PRIMARY

01:57:42.922 --> 01:57:44.557
USER OF THAT DATA.

01:57:44.624 --> 01:57:47.794
AND THEN THAT PRIMARY USER --

01:57:47.860 --> 01:57:50.229
SELLS IT OR DISCLOSES THAT

01:57:50.296 --> 01:57:53.566
INFORMATION TO SECONDARY USERS.

01:57:53.633 --> 01:57:55.635
SO I GUESS MY QUESTION IS.

01:57:55.701 --> 01:57:57.437
IF CERTAIN INDUSTRIES ARE

01:57:57.503 --> 01:57:59.005
FEARFUL THAT THEY WILL --

01:57:59.071 --> 01:58:01.607
HAVE A REDUCTION IN BUSINESS OR

01:58:01.674 --> 01:58:03.709
MARKET SHARE --

01:58:03.776 --> 01:58:05.445
IS THIS A MITIGATED BOWL

01:58:05.511 --> 01:58:07.613
SITUATION WHEN.

01:58:07.680 --> 01:58:11.150
THE PRIMARY USER CAN.

01:58:11.217 --> 01:58:13.753
LOOK UPON THAT DATA IN MAKE

01:58:13.820 --> 01:58:15.721
EITHER RETAINING PROFESSIONAL TO

01:58:15.788 --> 01:58:17.056
DO SO OR THEMSELVES.

01:58:17.123 --> 01:58:18.558
ARE LOOK UPON THE PURCHASING

01:58:18.624 --> 01:58:21.227
PATTERNS OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS.

01:58:21.294 --> 01:58:23.196
AND MAYBE EVEN THE CONSUMER

01:58:23.262 --> 01:58:24.397
PROFILES.

01:58:24.464 --> 01:58:26.365
ARE THEY COME ABOUT FROM THAT

01:58:26.432 --> 01:58:28.568
GATHERED INFORMATION IN IT IN

01:58:28.634 --> 01:58:31.571
AND DISAGGREGATED FORMAT.

01:58:31.637 --> 01:58:32.905
THEY COULD THEN.

01:58:32.972 --> 01:58:35.575
SELL OR DISCLOSE THAT.

01:58:35.641 --> 01:58:37.210
OUR INFORMATION AS LONG AS IT'S

01:58:37.276 --> 01:58:41.280
DISAGGREGATED IS THAT CORRECT.

01:58:41.347 --> 01:58:42.381
MAYBE I DON'T KNOW IT AND MISS

01:58:42.448 --> 01:58:44.984
JOHNSON MAYBE I THINK YOU --

01:58:45.051 --> 01:58:47.186
IT'S A COMPANY COULD TAKE

01:58:47.253 --> 01:58:49.689
AGGREGATED AND DE IDENTIFIED

01:58:49.755 --> 01:58:51.624
INFORMATION AND AND SHARE SO THE

01:58:51.691 --> 01:58:53.259
CCPA DOES HAVE --

01:58:53.326 --> 01:58:55.795
EXEMPTIONS THAT ALLOW FOR

01:58:55.862 --> 01:58:57.763
BUSINESSES TO DO EXACTLY THAT

01:58:57.830 --> 01:58:59.632
THE THINGS THAT THE IDENTIFIED

01:58:59.699 --> 01:59:01.801
AND THAT MEANS ARE STILL ABLE TO

01:59:01.868 --> 01:59:04.070
UNDERSTAND THEIR MARKET.

01:59:04.136 --> 01:59:06.339
BEHAVIOR YOU WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO

01:59:06.405 --> 01:59:08.207
IDENTIFY THE INDIVIDUAL THE YOU

01:59:08.274 --> 01:59:09.809
WOULD BE ABLE TO AYE DISSIDENT

01:59:09.876 --> 01:59:10.843
IT WILL EXACTLY.

01:59:10.910 --> 01:59:12.278
BUT WHAT I'M SAYING IS THAT IF

01:59:12.345 --> 01:59:13.913
WE'RE HEARING THAT MARKET SHARE

01:59:13.980 --> 01:59:16.115
WILL BE LOST.

01:59:16.182 --> 01:59:17.817
BUSINESSES MAKE A WONDER.

01:59:17.884 --> 01:59:19.952
I'M WONDERING TO WHAT EXTENT IS

01:59:20.019 --> 01:59:22.188
THAT ACCURATE IF WE UNDERSTAND

01:59:22.255 --> 01:59:23.289
THAT.

01:59:23.356 --> 01:59:24.490
YOU CAN STILL UNDERSTAND

01:59:24.557 --> 01:59:26.659
CUSTOMER BEHAVIOR IN IN

01:59:26.726 --> 01:59:28.361
PURCHASING PROFILES.

01:59:28.427 --> 01:59:30.796
PUT THAT BACK INTO THE SYSTEM.

01:59:30.863 --> 01:59:33.165
EACH IS THE PURCHASING PROFILE

01:59:33.232 --> 01:59:34.867
JUST NOT THE INDIVIDUAL WHO IS

01:59:34.934 --> 01:59:36.802
KNOWN.

01:59:36.869 --> 01:59:39.772
IF HE SAID IS IT FAIR TO I THINK

01:59:39.839 --> 01:59:41.240
THAT'S FAIR IF YOU'RE IF YOU.

01:59:41.307 --> 01:59:42.775
APPROPRIATELY DE IDENTIFIED OR

01:59:42.842 --> 01:59:44.043
AGGREGATE OF THE DATA YOU CAN

01:59:44.110 --> 01:59:45.478
STILL CLEAN A LOT OF INSIGHTS

01:59:45.545 --> 01:59:46.612
FROM IT.

01:59:46.679 --> 01:59:49.015
AS A BUSINESS AND YOU'RE STILL

01:59:49.081 --> 01:59:52.518
ABLE TO DO THAT AT THE C. CPI.

01:59:52.585 --> 01:59:55.288
THE ABSURD YEAH I THINK WE HAVE ---AND THAT MIGHT BE COVERED UNDER

01:59:55.354 --> 01:59:56.522
THE CONCEPT OF SU DONNA MAIS

01:59:56.589 --> 01:59:57.857
DATA MAYBE THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE

01:59:57.924 --> 01:59:59.392
REFERRING TO SO THAT YOU CAN

01:59:59.458 --> 02:00:00.660
HAVE DATA THAT IS EITHER.

02:00:00.726 --> 02:00:05.164
HOSTER MASKS THAT YOU DON'T HAVE

02:00:05.231 --> 02:00:05.831
YEAH I DON'T TO FIVE WILL PIECES

02:00:05.898 --> 02:00:07.600
OF THE DATA BUT YOU HAVE ACCESS

02:00:07.667 --> 02:00:09.168
TO THE REST OF THE PROFILE

02:00:09.235 --> 02:00:10.469
INFORMATION PERSONALLY SANITIZED

02:00:10.536 --> 02:00:11.737
RIGHT RIGHT EXACTLY AND I THINK

02:00:11.804 --> 02:00:13.506
THAT IS GENERALLY COVER BUT IT'S

02:00:13.573 --> 02:00:15.408
NOT SORT OF AS SPECIFICALLY

02:00:15.474 --> 02:00:15.808
IDENTIFIED.

02:00:15.875 --> 02:00:17.543
AS IT IS UNDER --

02:00:17.610 --> 02:00:19.512
UNDER THE GPR SO THAT IS ONE

02:00:19.579 --> 02:00:20.146
PLACE FOR THE COULD BE

02:00:20.212 --> 02:00:22.081
CLARIFICATION OF DATA IS SHARED

02:00:22.148 --> 02:00:25.017
AN ACE TO DONNA MAIS FORMAT --

02:00:25.084 --> 02:00:26.953
THAT THAT MIGHT ALLOW MORE

02:00:27.019 --> 02:00:29.989
LEEWAY --

02:00:30.056 --> 02:00:30.523
FOR SOME OF THESE BUSINESS

02:00:30.590 --> 02:00:31.958
TRANSACTIONS.

02:00:32.024 --> 02:00:33.326
I JUST I THINK SYNONYMIZED IS IS

02:00:33.392 --> 02:00:33.893
DIFFERENT THAN DE IDENTIFIED

02:00:33.960 --> 02:00:34.427
AGGREGATE IT AND YOU CAN

02:00:34.493 --> 02:00:36.095
SOMETIMES TELL THE INDIVIDUALS

AND I TELL THE IDENTITY OF AN

02:00:38.297 --> 02:00:39.699
INDIVIDUAL.

02:00:39.765 --> 02:00:40.499
MORE EASILY LISTED ON MY STATUS

02:00:40.566 --> 02:00:42.368

WITH FOUR WERE A FEW YEARS AGO

02:00:52.745 --> 02:00:54.680
THAT KIND OF EXPLAINS THIS IS

02:00:54.747 --> 02:00:56.716
SPECTRUM OF THE THE PHONE FULLY

02:00:56.782 --> 02:00:57.550

ANONYMIZED DATA AND THIS IS LIKE

02:01:01.721 --> 02:01:03.956
IT IS A LIKE A DEGREE OF GRACE

02:01:04.023 --> 02:01:04.757
RIGHT.

THIRTY FIVE FROM THE EUROPEAN

02:01:06.892 --> 02:01:07.793
PERSPECTIVE IS THAT EUROPE

02:01:07.860 --> 02:01:09.228
DOESN'T PROHIBIT THE SALE OF THE

02:01:09.295 --> 02:01:10.162

02:01:10.229 --> 02:01:10.963

THE THE FOR UNETHICAL PURPOSES

02:01:12.965 --> 02:01:14.467
ONE GOOD EXAMPLE THAT I COULD

02:01:14.533 --> 02:01:15.968

THIS UP NOBODY WANTS TO INHIBIT.

02:02:10.890 --> 02:02:12.658
INNOVATION ON THE OTHER HAND WE

FOURTEEN THOUSAND SMALL

02:03:16.522 --> 02:03:17.523
BUSINESSES.

02:03:17.590 --> 02:03:18.991
AS YOU KNOW CCPA PASTOR

02:03:19.058 --> 02:03:20.593
LEGISLATIVE PROCESS IN JUST ONE

02:03:20.659 --> 02:03:21.527
WEEK.

02:03:21.594 --> 02:03:22.862
DUE TO THE IMPENDING DEADLINE TO

02:03:22.928 --> 02:03:23.629
REMOVE THE INITIATIVE FROM THE

02:03:23.696 --> 02:03:24.730
BALLOT.

02:03:24.797 --> 02:03:26.098
THERE WAS NOT AN OPPORTUNITY FOR

02:03:26.165 --> 02:03:27.566
DIVERSE STATE COURT HOLDER INPUT

02:03:27.633 --> 02:03:29.401
AND THE RESULT IS A LOT THAT CAN

02:03:29.468 --> 02:03:30.836
BE CONFUSING AND THAT PRESENTS

02:03:30.903 --> 02:03:32.638
SOME SERIOUS PRIVACY CONCERNS AN

02:03:32.705 --> 02:03:34.073
OPERATIONAL CHALLENGES.

02:03:34.140 --> 02:03:35.374
LAST JUNE WHEN THE LAW WAS

02:03:35.441 --> 02:03:36.442
PASSED TO THE FACT THAT IT NEEDS

02:03:36.509 --> 02:03:38.244
FIXES WAS NOT CONTROVERSIAL THE

02:03:38.310 --> 02:03:39.445
AUTHORS NOTED THERE WOULD NEED

02:03:39.512 --> 02:03:40.279
TO BE SOME FIXES IN NUMEROUS

02:03:40.346 --> 02:03:41.547
LEGISLATORS SIGNED ON TO A

02:03:41.614 --> 02:03:42.581
LETTER STATING THAT WHILE THE

02:03:42.648 --> 02:03:43.983
AGREED WITH THE BILL'S EXPANSION

02:03:44.049 --> 02:03:45.351
OF PRIVACY RIGHTS.

02:03:45.417 --> 02:03:46.051
THEY WERE CONCERNED WITH HOW

02:03:46.118 --> 02:03:47.586
QUICKLY IT PASSED AND EXPECTED

02:03:47.653 --> 02:03:50.456
TO BE ABLE TO WORK ON REASONABLE

02:03:50.523 --> 02:03:51.724
FIXES GOING FORWARD.

02:03:51.791 --> 02:03:52.892
UNFORTUNATELY SINCE THERE THAT

02:03:52.958 --> 02:03:54.160
TIME THERE'S BEEN A NARRATIVE

02:03:54.226 --> 02:03:54.827
THAT ANY CHANGES TO THIS LAW ARE.

02:03:54.894 --> 02:03:55.795
REQUESTED BY BUSINESS WOULD BE

02:03:55.861 --> 02:03:57.163
ROLLING ACK PRIVACY RIGHTS BUT

02:03:57.229 --> 02:03:58.464
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

02:03:58.531 --> 02:03:59.532
AND THE NARRATIVE THAT THIS LAW

02:03:59.598 --> 02:04:01.100
ONLY APPLIES TO BIG TACK AND

02:04:01.167 --> 02:04:02.468
DATA BROKERS ISN'T TRUE EITHER.

02:04:02.535 --> 02:04:04.103
IT'S EASY PAY APPLIES TO A THIRD

02:04:04.170 --> 02:04:05.971
VERY BROAD CATEGORY BUSINESSES

02:04:06.038 --> 02:04:06.906
ANY BUSINESS CITY ANNUALLY

02:04:06.972 --> 02:04:08.240
RECEIVES THE PERSONAL

02:04:08.307 --> 02:04:09.942
INFORMATION OF FIFTY THOUSAND OR

02:04:10.009 --> 02:04:11.443
MORE CONSUMERS HOUSEHOLDS OR

02:04:11.510 --> 02:04:12.478
DEVICES.

02:04:12.545 --> 02:04:14.180
IT TURNS OUT FIFTY THOUSAND

02:04:14.246 --> 02:04:15.347
PIECES OF DATA IS NOT A LOT.

02:04:15.414 --> 02:04:16.615
GIVEN THAT ONE CONSUMER CAN BE

02:04:16.682 --> 02:04:18.450
COUNTED MULTIPLE TIMES AND GIVEN

02:04:18.517 --> 02:04:19.885
THE C. C. P.'S BROAD DEFINITION

02:04:19.952 --> 02:04:21.320

INCLUDES IP ADDRESSES AND SO

02:04:22.988 --> 02:04:24.990
MUCH MORE. FOR EXAMPLE THE CCP

02:04:25.057 --> 02:04:27.092
APPLIES TO BUSINESSES WITH FIFTY

02:04:27.159 --> 02:04:27.693
THOUSAND WEBSITE VISITORS PER

02:04:27.760 --> 02:04:28.494
YEAR.

02:04:28.561 --> 02:04:29.862
IF THE BUSINESS HAS AN AVERAGE

02:04:29.929 --> 02:04:30.996
OF A HUNDRED AND THIRTY SEVEN

02:04:31.063 --> 02:04:32.498
UNIQUE ONLINE VISITORS PER DAY

02:04:32.565 --> 02:04:34.066
IT WILL HIT THAT THRESHOLD.

02:04:34.133 --> 02:04:36.168
AND JUST THINK OF ALL THE SMALL

02:04:36.235 --> 02:04:38.938
BUSINESSES THAT EASILY CAN TODAY

02:04:39.004 --> 02:04:39.939
WHICH IS ABOUT TWELVE

02:04:40.005 --> 02:04:41.507
TRANSACTIONS PER HOUR IN A

02:04:41.574 --> 02:04:42.508
TWELVE HOUR DAY YOU GOT

02:04:42.575 --> 02:04:44.643
CONVENIENCE STORES COFFEE SHOPS

02:04:44.710 --> 02:04:46.111
RESTAURANTS THERE ARE VERY MANY.

02:04:46.178 --> 02:04:47.379
THE POINT IS THAT THE CZ P. A.

02:04:47.446 --> 02:04:48.514
COVERS.

02:04:48.581 --> 02:04:50.216
DIVERSITY OF BUSINESSES AND

02:04:50.282 --> 02:04:50.983
TREATS THEM ALL THE SAME IS A

02:04:51.050 --> 02:04:53.519
HANDFUL OF LARGE TECH GIANTS IN

02:04:53.586 --> 02:04:54.119
THE STATE.

02:04:54.186 --> 02:04:55.588
SO PLEASE KEEP THAT DIVERSITY OF

02:04:55.654 --> 02:04:56.589
BUSINESS AND MINE IS OUTLINED

02:04:57.790 --> 02:04:59.124
KEEP AN OPEN MIND.

02:04:59.191 --> 02:05:00.192
I'M GONNA START BY DISCUSSING

02:05:00.259 --> 02:05:01.727
FIVE FIX IS NECESSARY TO PROTECT

02:05:01.794 --> 02:05:04.096
CONSUMER DATA SECURITY PRIVACY

02:05:04.163 --> 02:05:04.997
AND CHOICE.

02:05:05.064 --> 02:05:06.365
FIRST THE CCPA REQUIRES

02:05:06.432 --> 02:05:07.700
BUSINESSES TO PROVIDE CONSUMERS

02:05:07.766 --> 02:05:09.702
SPECIFIC PIECES OF INFORMATION

02:05:09.768 --> 02:05:11.704
THE BUSINESSES COLLECTED AFTER

02:05:11.770 --> 02:05:13.005
RECEIVING A CONSUMER REQUEST.

02:05:13.072 --> 02:05:14.340
BUT SPECIFIC PIECES OF

02:05:14.406 --> 02:05:16.075
INFORMATION IS NOT DEFINED IT

02:05:16.141 --> 02:05:17.476
COULD MEAN BUSINESSES MUST

02:05:17.543 --> 02:05:18.510
TRANSMIT HIGHLY SENSITIVE

02:05:18.577 --> 02:05:20.145
INFORMATION BACK TO CONSUMERS

02:05:20.212 --> 02:05:21.146
LIKE CREDIT CARDS.

02:05:21.213 --> 02:05:22.448
OR SPECIFIC INTERNET SEARCHES

02:05:22.514 --> 02:05:23.716
INFORMATION CONSUMERS ALREADY

02:05:23.782 --> 02:05:25.251
KNOW ABOUT THEMSELVES.

02:05:25.317 --> 02:05:26.252
THIS WOULD CREATE A RISK OF

02:05:26.318 --> 02:05:28.287
FRAUDSTERS POSING AS THE

02:05:28.354 --> 02:05:28.888
CONSUMER TO GET ACCESS TO THIS

02:05:28.954 --> 02:05:30.656
DATA. TO ALLEVIATE THIS RISK A

02:05:30.723 --> 02:05:31.891
BUSINESS MAY NEED TO COLLECT

02:05:31.957 --> 02:05:33.392
EVEN MORE INFORMATION FROM THE

02:05:35.027 --> 02:05:36.595
IT IS SENDING SENSITIVE

02:05:36.662 --> 02:05:37.730
INFORMATION TO THE RIGHT PERSON

02:05:37.796 --> 02:05:38.998
ESPECIALLY WHEN A BUSINESS HAS

02:05:39.064 --> 02:05:40.499
NO DIRECT CONSUMER RELATIONSHIP

02:05:40.566 --> 02:05:41.667
WITH THE CONSUMER.

02:05:41.734 --> 02:05:43.269
THIS RUNS COUNTER TO PRIVACY

02:05:43.335 --> 02:05:44.270
GOALS AND COULD GREATLY HARM

02:05:44.336 --> 02:05:45.905
CONSUMERS WE'RE REQUESTING AS

02:05:45.971 --> 02:05:47.306
THE CPA AMENDMENT TO LIMIT THESE

02:05:47.373 --> 02:05:48.974
RISKS SECOND THE C. C. P.'S

PERSONAL INFORMATION ALSO

02:05:53.345 --> 02:05:54.947
PRESENT SERIOUS RISKS.

ABLE TO ACCESS ALL THE SPECIFIC

02:06:16.302 --> 02:06:17.503
A PREGNANCY TEST.

02:06:17.569 --> 02:06:19.371
SIMILARLY ONE USER OF A DEVICE

02:06:19.438 --> 02:06:20.606
CAN REQUEST ALL THE SPECIFIC

02:06:20.673 --> 02:06:21.774
PIECES OF INFORMATION THE

02:06:21.840 --> 02:06:23.008
COMPANY HAS ABOUT THAT

02:06:23.075 --> 02:06:24.209
PARTICULAR DEVICE WHICH COULD

02:06:24.276 --> 02:06:26.211
REVEAL PRIVATE THINGS ABOUT

02:06:26.278 --> 02:06:27.579
ANOTHER USER OF THAT DEVICE.

02:06:27.646 --> 02:06:28.781
THE INCLUSION OF HOUSEHOLDS AND

02:06:28.847 --> 02:06:30.449
DEVICES COULD ALSO INFRINGE ON

02:06:30.516 --> 02:06:31.383
THE CHOICES OF OTHERS FOR

02:06:31.450 --> 02:06:32.885
EXAMPLE IF ONE HOUSEHOLD MEMBER

02:06:32.952 --> 02:06:35.220
MAKES A REQUEST TO DELETE ALL

02:06:35.287 --> 02:06:36.655
DATA ASSOCIATED WITH HOUSEHOLD.

02:06:36.722 --> 02:06:37.656
ANOTHER HOUSEHOLD MEMBER WOULD

02:06:37.723 --> 02:06:39.892
BE SUBSEQUENTLY UNABLE TO ACCESS

02:06:39.959 --> 02:06:41.193
THEIR INFORMATION.

02:06:41.260 --> 02:06:42.361
THIRD.

02:06:42.428 --> 02:06:43.362
THE DEFINITION OF PERSONAL

02:06:43.429 --> 02:06:44.897
INFORMATION IS INCREDIBLY OVER

02:06:44.964 --> 02:06:46.498
BROAD IF NOT ADJUSTED IT WILL

02:06:46.565 --> 02:06:47.800
UNDERMINE EXISTING PRIVACY

02:06:47.866 --> 02:06:49.368
PROTECTIVE PRACTICES.

02:06:49.435 --> 02:06:50.235
AND IMPOSE SIGNIFICANT

02:06:50.302 --> 02:06:52.371
OPERATIONAL COSTS ON BUSINESSES

02:06:52.438 --> 02:06:53.505
MEANT MOST PEOPLE THINK OF

02:06:53.572 --> 02:06:54.673
PERSONAL INFORMATION IS DATA

02:06:54.740 --> 02:06:56.275
THAT COULD IDENTIFY SOMEONE LIKE

02:06:56.342 --> 02:06:57.409
BIRTHDATES OR SOCIAL SECURITY

02:06:57.476 --> 02:06:57.943
NUMBERS.

02:06:58.010 --> 02:06:59.645
THE CZ PA DEFINES PERSONAL

02:06:59.712 --> 02:07:01.714
INFORMATION FAR MORE BROADLY AS

02:07:01.780 --> 02:07:03.816
INFORMATION THAT YES IDENTIFIES

02:07:03.882 --> 02:07:05.250
BUT ALSO THAT RELATES TO

02:07:05.317 --> 02:07:07.119
DESCRIBES IS CAPABLE OF BEING

02:07:07.186 --> 02:07:08.554
ASSOCIATED WITH OR COULD

02:07:08.620 --> 02:07:10.622
REASONABLY BE LINKED TO A

02:07:10.689 --> 02:07:12.224
PARTICULAR CONSUMER HOUSEHOLD.

02:07:12.291 --> 02:07:13.692
ODDLY THIS DEFINITION CREATES A

02:07:13.759 --> 02:07:15.494
REASONABLE STANDARD FOR DATA

02:07:15.561 --> 02:07:16.595
THAT CAN BE LINKED TO A PERSON --

02:07:16.662 --> 02:07:18.063
HOUSEHOLD BUT IT DOESN'T MAKE

02:07:18.130 --> 02:07:19.431
THE SAME ALLOWANCE OF

02:07:19.498 --> 02:07:20.799
REASONABLENESS FOR DATA THAT IS

02:07:20.866 --> 02:07:22.534
CAPABLE OF BEING ASSOCIATED WITH

02:07:22.601 --> 02:07:23.235
THEM.

02:07:23.302 --> 02:07:24.636
AS A PRACTICAL MATTER THIS MEANS

02:07:24.703 --> 02:07:26.038
PERSONAL INFORMATION TO THE C.

02:07:26.105 --> 02:07:28.240
CPA IS ANY INFORMATION THAT

02:07:28.307 --> 02:07:30.642
COULD IN THEORY BE ASSOCIATED

02:07:30.709 --> 02:07:31.577
WITH A PERSON OR HOUSEHOLD.

02:07:31.643 --> 02:07:33.412
LET'S PUT THIS INTO CONTEXT IF I

02:07:33.479 --> 02:07:34.380
HAVE AN ONLINE ACCOUNT WITH THE

02:07:34.446 --> 02:07:36.048
STORE AND EXERCISE MY RIGHTS

02:07:36.115 --> 02:07:37.082
UNDER THE SEA CPA.

02:07:37.149 --> 02:07:38.517
THAT STORE SHOULD BE ABLE TO

02:07:38.584 --> 02:07:39.618
PROVIDE ME WITH MY COUNTY TELLS

02:07:39.685 --> 02:07:40.919
OUR TO DELETE THEM.

02:07:40.986 --> 02:07:43.555
BUT THAT'S ONLY THE BEGINNING OF

02:07:43.622 --> 02:07:46.058
WHAT BUSINESS IS REQUIRED TO

02:07:46.125 --> 02:07:47.092
STORES WEBSITE OR PHILLIP

02:07:47.159 --> 02:07:48.093
SHOPPING CARTS WITHOUT LOGGING

02:07:48.160 --> 02:07:48.560
IN.

02:07:48.627 --> 02:07:49.695
AND THAT STORE KEEPS I. P.

02:07:49.762 --> 02:07:50.929
ADDRESSES TO TRACK HOW CONSUMERS

02:07:50.996 --> 02:07:52.731
USE OUR WEBSITE BUT IT DOESN'T

02:07:52.798 --> 02:07:55.167
LINK THAT DATA BACK. TO A PERSON

02:07:55.234 --> 02:07:57.269
UNDER THE SEA CPA THE STORE

02:07:57.336 --> 02:07:58.103
COULD BE REQUIRED TO SEARCH FOR

02:07:58.170 --> 02:07:59.571
EVERY POSSIBLE I. P. ADDRESS

02:07:59.638 --> 02:08:01.106
THAT THEY COULD IN THAT THEY

02:08:01.173 --> 02:08:02.408
HAVE THAT COULD IN THEORY BE

02:08:02.474 --> 02:08:03.542
LINKED BACK TO ME.

02:08:03.609 --> 02:08:05.110
SIMILARLY IF I MADE A PURCHASE

02:08:05.177 --> 02:08:06.111
INSIDE THEIR BRICK AND MORTAR

02:08:06.178 --> 02:08:07.479
STORE THEY COULD BE REQUIRED TO

02:08:07.546 --> 02:08:10.049
SEARCH SECURITY CAMERA FOOTAGE

02:08:10.115 --> 02:08:11.650
TO FIND OUT WHERE I APPEAR ON IT.

02:08:11.717 --> 02:08:12.518
THE ONLY WAY FOR BUSINESSES TO

02:08:12.584 --> 02:08:13.652
COMPLY WOULD BE TO IDENTIFY

02:08:13.719 --> 02:08:14.653
PEOPLE INTERACTING WITH THEIR

02:08:14.720 --> 02:08:15.654
BUSINESS AND STORE THAT

02:08:15.721 --> 02:08:16.722
INFORMATION TOGETHER IN ONE

02:08:16.789 --> 02:08:18.057
PLACE WHICH WOULD BE HUGELY

02:08:18.123 --> 02:08:19.925
WASTEFUL AND HARMFUL TO CONSUMER

02:08:19.992 --> 02:08:21.093
PRIVACY.

02:08:21.160 --> 02:08:22.194
WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT WAS THE

02:08:22.261 --> 02:08:23.796
RESULT INTENDED THE LAW HAS AN

02:08:23.862 --> 02:08:25.297
EXEMPTION STATING THAT A

02:08:25.364 --> 02:08:27.266
BUSINESS IS NOT REQUIRED TO RE

02:08:27.332 --> 02:08:28.600
LINK DATA.

02:08:28.667 --> 02:08:29.968
THAT IS NOT MAINTAINED IN A

02:08:30.035 --> 02:08:31.570
MANNER THAT WOULD BE CONSIDERED

02:08:31.637 --> 02:08:32.871
PERSONAL INFORMATION BUT UNDER

02:08:32.938 --> 02:08:33.806
THE DEFINITION OF PERSONAL

02:08:33.872 --> 02:08:36.375
INFORMATION BASICALLY ALL DATA

02:08:36.442 --> 02:08:37.810
IS PERSONAL INFORMATION SO --

02:08:37.876 --> 02:08:39.044
AS DRAFTED THE EXEMPTION DOESN'T

02:08:39.111 --> 02:08:40.279
PROVIDE RELIEF AND IT SHOULD BE

02:08:40.345 --> 02:08:41.547
FIXED.

02:08:41.613 --> 02:08:43.048
FINALLY ALTHOUGH THE DEFINITION

02:08:43.115 --> 02:08:44.116
OF PERSONAL INFORMATION IS

02:08:44.183 --> 02:08:45.517
PRETTY ALL ENCOMPASSING THERE

02:08:45.584 --> 02:08:46.718
ARE THREE TYPES OF DATA THAT WE

02:08:46.785 --> 02:08:48.353
BELIEVE ARE NOT MEANT TO BE

02:08:48.420 --> 02:08:49.555
PERSONAL INFORMATION UNDER THE

02:08:49.621 --> 02:08:50.022
LAW.

02:08:50.089 --> 02:08:52.124
AGGREGATE DATA DE IDENTIFIED

02:08:52.191 --> 02:08:53.559
DATA AND PUBLICLY AVAILABLE DATA.

02:08:53.625 --> 02:08:54.893
BUT EVEN THESE EXEMPTIONS NEED

02:08:54.960 --> 02:08:56.295
ADJUSTMENTS TO BE MEANINGFUL

02:08:56.361 --> 02:08:57.496
UNDER THE DEFINITION OF DE

02:08:57.563 --> 02:08:59.198

IDENTIFIED WHICH WOULD

02:09:01.266 --> 02:09:03.268
DISCOURAGE BUSINESSES FROM USING

02:09:03.335 --> 02:09:04.670
THIS PRIVACY PROTECTED PRACTICE.

02:09:04.736 --> 02:09:06.004
ADDITIONALLY THE DEFINITION OF

02:09:06.071 --> 02:09:08.740
PUBLICLY AVAILABLE INFORMATION

02:09:08.807 --> 02:09:10.542
IS LIMITED TO GOVERNMENT RECORDS

02:09:10.609 --> 02:09:11.910
BUT THEN IT'S FURTHER RESTRICTED

02:09:11.977 --> 02:09:14.546
TO SUCH RECORDS THAT ARE USED

02:09:14.613 --> 02:09:16.381
FOR A PURPOSE THAT IS COMPATIBLE

02:09:16.448 --> 02:09:19.318
WITH THE PURPOSE FOR WHICH THE

GOVERNMENT IS MAINTAINING THAT

02:09:19.985 --> 02:09:20.719
DATA.

02:09:20.786 --> 02:09:21.420
ASIDE FROM BEING CONFUSING

02:09:21.487 --> 02:09:22.488
ENOUGH INVITING UNNECESSARY

02:09:22.554 --> 02:09:23.589
LITIGATION.

02:09:23.655 --> 02:09:24.523
THIS RESTRICTIONS ON

CONSTITUTIONAL LIMIT ON FREE

02:09:26.225 --> 02:09:26.792

02:09:27.759 --> 02:09:29.428
FOURTH.

02:09:29.495 --> 02:09:30.095
CONFUSING LANGUAGE IN THE

02:09:30.162 --> 02:09:31.997
NONDISCRIMINATION SECTION RAISES

02:09:32.064 --> 02:09:33.432
DOUBTS ABOUT THE LEGALITY OF

02:09:33.499 --> 02:09:34.967
LOYALTY AND REWARDS PROGRAMS

HOTELS AIRLINES AND OTHERS.

02:09:38.403 --> 02:09:39.905
CONSUMERS LOVE THESE PROGRAMS IN

02:09:39.972 --> 02:09:42.207
FACT 80% OF AMERICANS BELONG TO

02:09:42.274 --> 02:09:43.375
AT LEAST.

02:09:43.442 --> 02:09:44.443
ONE WHAT WE UNDERSTAND THE

02:09:44.510 --> 02:09:45.811
LEGISLATIVE INTENT IS THAT

02:09:45.878 --> 02:09:47.079
BUSINESSES CAN CONTINUE TO OFFER

02:09:47.146 --> 02:09:48.514
THEM UNLESS THE SECTIONS

02:09:48.580 --> 02:09:49.681
CLARIFIED IT'LL BE UP TO THE

COURTS TO DETERMINE THE FTE OF

02:09:50.949 --> 02:09:52.784
THESE PROGRAMS AND THERE'S NO

02:09:52.851 --> 02:09:53.252
NEED FOR THAT LEVEL OF

02:09:53.318 --> 02:09:54.353
UNCERTAINTY.

02:09:54.419 --> 02:09:56.188
FIFTH THE CCPA ALSO NEEDS TO BE

02:09:56.255 --> 02:09:58.323
CLARIFIED TO PREVENT BAD ACTORS

02:09:58.390 --> 02:10:00.025
FROM OPTING OUT OF DATA SERVICES

02:10:00.092 --> 02:10:01.326
USED EMPLOYMENT CRUCIAL

02:10:01.393 --> 02:10:02.761
GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS AS WELL AS

02:10:02.828 --> 02:10:04.396
TO PREVENT IDENTITY THEFT AND

02:10:04.463 --> 02:10:05.631
MONEY LAUNDERING.

02:10:05.697 --> 02:10:06.732
I'M NOW GOING TO DISCUSS TO

02:10:06.798 --> 02:10:08.267
AREAS OF THIS LAW THAT WILL LEAD

02:10:08.333 --> 02:10:09.935
TO UNNECESSARY COMPLIANCE COSTS

02:10:10.002 --> 02:10:11.637
FOR BUSINESSES AND UNINTENDED

02:10:11.703 --> 02:10:13.272
CONSEQUENCES IF NOT FIXED.

02:10:13.338 --> 02:10:15.407
FIRST THE DEFINITION OF CONSUMER

02:10:15.474 --> 02:10:16.642
IS ANY CALIFORNIA RESIDENT AND

02:10:16.708 --> 02:10:17.776
WITHOUT CLARIFICATION THAT COULD

02:10:17.843 --> 02:10:19.077
BE INTERPRETED TO INCLUDE

02:10:19.144 --> 02:10:20.112
EMPLOYEES.

02:10:20.179 --> 02:10:21.446
THE OPERATIONAL COSTS FOR

02:10:21.513 --> 02:10:22.781
BUSINESSES ESPECIALLY SMALL

02:10:22.848 --> 02:10:25.184
BUSINESSES INCLUDING EMPLOYEES

02:10:25.250 --> 02:10:25.884
AND JOB APPLICANTS WILL BE

02:10:25.951 --> 02:10:26.985
EXORBITANT.

02:10:27.052 --> 02:10:28.153
IMAGINE A FAMILY OWNED

02:10:28.220 --> 02:10:30.522
RESTAURANT THAT SERVES A HUNDRED

02:10:30.589 --> 02:10:31.757
FIFTY SING THIS DEFINITION IT

02:10:31.823 --> 02:10:32.925
MAY HAVE TO OPERATE

02:10:32.991 --> 02:10:34.226
OPERATIONALIZE.

02:10:34.293 --> 02:10:35.527
THE CCPA FOR ITS KITCHEN AND

02:10:35.594 --> 02:10:36.662
WAIT STAFF AND A BUSINESS WITH

02:10:36.728 --> 02:10:37.896
HIGH TURNOVER AND LOW PROFIT

02:10:37.963 --> 02:10:39.031
MARGINS.

02:10:39.097 --> 02:10:40.732
ACCESS TO PERSONAL INFORMATION

02:10:40.799 --> 02:10:42.301
IN THE EMPLOYMENT CONTEXT IS

02:10:42.367 --> 02:10:43.235
ALREADY ESTABLISHING CALIFORNIA

02:10:43.302 --> 02:10:45.003
LAW BUT THE CCPA WOULD ALLOW A

02:10:45.070 --> 02:10:46.405
SEPARATED SPOUSE WHO'S PART OF

02:10:46.471 --> 02:10:48.106
THE HOUSEHOLD TO GAIN ACCESS TO

02:10:48.173 --> 02:10:50.542
PAYROLL RECORDS.

02:10:50.609 --> 02:10:51.176
I CAN'T BE WITH THE LEGISLATURE

02:10:51.243 --> 02:10:51.810
INTENDED.

02:10:51.877 --> 02:10:53.245
THE DEFINITION OF CONSUMER IS

02:10:53.312 --> 02:10:54.913
ALSO PROBLEMATIC BECAUSE IT

02:10:54.980 --> 02:10:55.681
INCLUDES BUSINESS

02:10:55.747 --> 02:10:57.616
REPRESENTATIVES IN THE CONTEXT

02:10:57.683 --> 02:10:58.116
OF BUSINESS TO BUSINESS

02:10:58.183 --> 02:10:59.218
INTERACTIONS.

02:10:59.284 --> 02:11:00.519
SO FOR EXAMPLE A SMALL MEDICAL

02:11:00.586 --> 02:11:02.087
PRACTICE THAT ALREADY COMPLIES

02:11:02.154 --> 02:11:04.122
WITH HIP A FOR PATIENT DATA

02:11:04.189 --> 02:11:05.824
WOULD BE REQUIRED TO HONOR OPT

02:11:05.891 --> 02:11:07.159
OUT AND DELETION REQUESTS FROM

02:11:07.226 --> 02:11:09.194
SUPPLIERS WITH WHOM THE EMAIL

02:11:09.261 --> 02:11:11.029
FOR BUSINESS PURPOSES.

02:11:11.096 --> 02:11:11.663
WE NEVER HAVE ACCESS TO PATIENT

02:11:11.730 --> 02:11:12.497
DATA.

02:11:12.564 --> 02:11:14.166
IF NOT FIXED THIS WILL LEAD TO

02:11:14.233 --> 02:11:15.634
UNFORTUNATE UNINTENDED

02:11:15.701 --> 02:11:17.169
CONSEQUENCES.

02:11:17.236 --> 02:11:18.503
SECOND I TARGETED ONLINE

02:11:18.570 --> 02:11:20.739
ADVERTISING IS ANOTHER AREA CCPA

02:11:20.806 --> 02:11:22.808
WAS NOT INTENDED TO IMPACT.

02:11:22.874 --> 02:11:23.375
HOWEVER THE CURRENT LANGUAGE

02:11:23.442 --> 02:11:24.109
LACKS CLARITY.

02:11:24.176 --> 02:11:25.477
ONLINE ADVERTISING IS A PRIVACY

02:11:25.544 --> 02:11:26.845
PROTECTED PRACTICE IN WHICH NO

02:11:26.912 --> 02:11:29.681
PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE

02:11:29.748 --> 02:11:31.283
INTERNET ECOSYSTEM DEPENDS ON IT

02:11:31.350 --> 02:11:32.618
FROM SMALL BLOGS TO LARGE

02:11:32.684 --> 02:11:33.852
PUBLICATIONS INCLUDING OUR

02:11:33.919 --> 02:11:35.554
FAVORITE NEWSPAPERS.

02:11:35.621 --> 02:11:36.955
AND BUSINESSES OF ALL SIZES.

02:11:37.022 --> 02:11:38.657
DEPEND ON US ADVERTISING NETWORK

02:11:38.724 --> 02:11:41.393
TO REACH CONSUMERS IT'S AN

02:11:41.460 --> 02:11:41.927
IMPORTANT AREA WE NEED TO

02:11:41.994 --> 02:11:43.028
CLARIFY.

02:11:43.095 --> 02:11:43.495
FINALLY I WILL ADDRESS

02:11:43.562 --> 02:11:44.796
ENFORCEMENT.

02:11:44.863 --> 02:11:46.465
THE CZ EIGHTY CZ PA CREATES AN

02:11:46.531 --> 02:11:47.799
ONEROUS PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION

02:11:47.866 --> 02:11:48.867
IS TO BUSINESSES THAT HAVE

02:11:48.934 --> 02:11:50.235
SUFFERED A DATA BREACH NO PROOF

02:11:50.302 --> 02:11:51.370
OF INJURY IS REQUIRED IN THE

02:11:51.436 --> 02:11:52.704
MINIMUM STATUTORY DAMAGES

02:11:52.771 --> 02:11:53.805
AWARDED COULD PUT FOLKS OUT OF

02:11:53.872 --> 02:11:55.007
BUSINESS.

02:11:55.073 --> 02:11:55.974
THERE SHOULD BE A SAFE HARBOR

02:11:56.041 --> 02:11:56.575
FOR BUSINESSES THAT HAVE

02:11:56.642 --> 02:11:59.177
IMPLEMENTED RECOGNIZED SECURITY

02:11:59.244 --> 02:12:00.679
STANDARDS BUT THERE ISN'T.

02:12:00.746 --> 02:12:02.614
AND DESPITE THIS AND DESPITE THE

02:12:02.681 --> 02:12:04.149
OTHER FLAWS WITH THIS LAW THE

02:12:04.216 --> 02:12:05.417
BUSINESS COMMUNITY ENCOURAGE

02:12:05.484 --> 02:12:07.219
LEGISLATORS TO VOTE FOR IT WHICH

02:12:07.286 --> 02:12:09.421
RESULTED IN THE UNANIMOUS VOTE

02:12:09.488 --> 02:12:11.290
WE DID THIS BECAUSE WE HOPE WE

02:12:11.356 --> 02:12:11.890
COULD FIX SOME OF THE PROBLEMS

02:12:11.957 --> 02:12:12.724
I'VE MENTIONED.

02:12:12.791 --> 02:12:13.592
AND BECAUSE THE P. R. A. WAS

02:12:13.659 --> 02:12:17.062
LIMITED SINCE OF THE LAW.

02:12:17.129 --> 02:12:18.830
LAS COMPLICATED IT CAN BE

02:12:18.897 --> 02:12:20.165
CONFUSING IT'S NOT FINISHED AND

02:12:20.232 --> 02:12:21.199
APPLIES TO BUSINESSES OF ALL

02:12:21.266 --> 02:12:22.567
SIZES AND I'VE BEEN ON CALLS

02:12:22.634 --> 02:12:23.502
WITH PRIVACY EXPERTS FROM AROUND

02:12:23.568 --> 02:12:25.604
THE COUNTRY WHO DISAGREE ON WHAT

02:12:25.671 --> 02:12:26.171
CERTAIN ASPECTS OF THIS LONG

02:12:26.238 --> 02:12:27.272
MEAN.

02:12:27.339 --> 02:12:28.573
WE SHOULD NOT EXTEND THE P. R.

02:12:28.640 --> 02:12:29.608
EIGHT HAVE TRIAL ATTORNEYS AND

02:12:29.675 --> 02:12:31.310
FORCE MORE OF THIS LAW WHICH HAS

02:12:31.376 --> 02:12:32.377
BEEN PULLED FROM A REGULATORY

02:12:32.444 --> 02:12:34.413
MODEL THE VIEWS AS WE'VE SEEN

02:12:34.479 --> 02:12:34.913
WITH PAGO WOULD PALE IN

02:12:34.980 --> 02:12:35.981
COMPARISON.

02:12:36.048 --> 02:12:37.215
IN CLOSING LET'S NOT LOSE SIGHT

02:12:37.282 --> 02:12:38.550
OF THE FACT THAT WE JUST PASSED

02:12:38.617 --> 02:12:40.652
MOST ROBUST PRIVACY LAW IN THIS

02:12:40.719 --> 02:12:41.053
COUNTRY.

02:12:41.119 --> 02:12:42.187
COMPLIANCE WITH THIS LAW WILL BE

02:12:42.254 --> 02:12:43.655
INCREDIBLY EXPENSIVE WE DON'T

02:12:43.722 --> 02:12:45.223
YET KNOW THE IMPACT THIS WILL

02:12:45.290 --> 02:12:46.692
HAVE ON OUR ECONOMY OR HOW IT

02:12:46.758 --> 02:12:48.126
COULD RAISE PRICES ON CONSUMERS

02:12:48.193 --> 02:12:49.394
AND THESE ARE CRUCIAL FACTORS

02:12:49.461 --> 02:12:50.796
LEGISLATORS NEED TO CONSIDER.

02:12:50.862 --> 02:12:53.065
BEFORE ADDING EVEN MORE ONEROUS

02:12:53.131 --> 02:12:54.933
BURDENS ON TOP OF THE CPA.

02:12:55.000 --> 02:12:58.003
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME.

OUT OF CONSUMER REPORTS SAN

MILLION CONSUMERS NATIONWIDE.

WORKING SIDE BY SIDE WITH

CONSUMERS TO CREATE A FAIR SAY

02:13:26.498 --> 02:13:29.167
FOR MARKET PLACE.

02:13:29.234 --> 02:13:30.335
IN THE AREAS OF PRIVACY IN TECH

02:13:30.402 --> 02:13:31.737

INCLUDING EVALUATE MEAN

COMPANIES --

02:13:40.746 --> 02:13:41.713
DATA PRIVACY AND SECURITY

02:13:41.780 --> 02:13:43.648
PRACTICES AND WE HAVE A LONG

02:13:43.715 --> 02:13:45.016
HISTORY OF ADVOCATING FOR

02:13:45.083 --> 02:13:46.618
STRONGER PRIVACY LAWS.

02:13:46.685 --> 02:13:48.086
NATIONALLY IN CITIES ACROSS

02:13:48.153 --> 02:13:49.855
COUNTRY AND ESPECIALLY IN

02:13:49.921 --> 02:13:51.490
CALIFORNIA.

02:13:51.556 --> 02:13:52.758
CONSUMER REPORTS COMMANDS

02:13:52.824 --> 02:13:54.726
CALIFORNIA LAWMAKERS FOR PASSING

02:13:54.793 --> 02:13:56.228
THE CALIFORNIA CONSUMER PRIVACY

02:13:56.294 --> 02:13:59.097
ACTS WE APPRECIATE THAT THIS LAW

02:13:59.164 --> 02:14:01.466
ADVANCES CONSUMER PROTECTIONS IN

02:14:01.533 --> 02:14:03.235
SEVERAL IMPORTANT WAYS.

02:14:03.301 --> 02:14:05.137
INCREASING TRANSPARENCY --

02:14:05.203 --> 02:14:06.304
PROVIDING THE RIGHT TO ACCESS TO

02:14:06.371 --> 02:14:08.039
LEADS AND THE RIGHT TO OPT OUT

02:14:08.106 --> 02:14:09.908
OF THE SALE OF THEIR INFORMATION

02:14:09.975 --> 02:14:10.809
TO THIRD PARTIES.

02:14:10.876 --> 02:14:13.311
AND SUCH A SOLUTION IS AN

02:14:13.378 --> 02:14:13.879
IMPORTANT STEP IN THE RIGHT

02:14:13.945 --> 02:14:14.646
DIRECTION.

02:14:14.713 --> 02:14:15.881
HOWEVER THE DISCUSSION

02:14:15.947 --> 02:14:17.883
SURROUNDING THE CCPA HAS BEEN

02:14:17.949 --> 02:14:19.451
TOO FOCUSED ON WORK ABILITY FOR

02:14:19.518 --> 02:14:21.953
BUSINESSES AND NOT ENOUGH ON

02:14:22.020 --> 02:14:23.655
WORK ABILITY FOR CONSUMERS. FOR

02:14:23.722 --> 02:14:25.123
EXAMPLE THE LEGISLATION PUTS A

02:14:25.190 --> 02:14:26.958
LOT OF THE RESPONSIBILITY ON THE

02:14:27.025 --> 02:14:29.661
CONSUMER TO IDENTIFY ALL OF THE

02:14:29.728 --> 02:14:30.729
COMPANIES THAT ARE COLLECTING

02:14:30.796 --> 02:14:32.063
INFORMATION AND SELLING

02:14:32.130 --> 02:14:33.331
INFORMATION.

02:14:33.398 --> 02:14:34.599
ABOUT THEM AND FIGURING OUT HOW

02:14:34.666 --> 02:14:37.102
TO OPT YOU WILL BE TOO

02:14:37.169 --> 02:14:38.804
BURDENSOME FOR MANY IF NOT MOST

02:14:38.870 --> 02:14:40.705
CONSUMERS.

02:14:40.772 --> 02:14:42.574
INSTEAD PRIVACY SHOULD BE.

02:14:42.641 --> 02:14:44.709
IT SURE BY THE DEFAULT AT THE

02:14:44.776 --> 02:14:46.478
VERY LEAST TO SEE CPA SHOULD

02:14:46.545 --> 02:14:47.913
EXPLICITLY PROVIDE FOR GLOBAL

02:14:47.979 --> 02:14:49.481
OPT OUTS --

02:14:49.548 --> 02:14:50.782
FOR EXAMPLE PLATFORM LEVEL DO

02:14:50.849 --> 02:14:52.384
NOT TRACK INSTRUCTIONS THAT

02:14:52.451 --> 02:14:54.820
COMPANY SHOULD BE OBLIGATED TO

02:14:54.886 --> 02:14:55.854
HONOR.

02:14:55.921 --> 02:14:57.222
CONSUMERS ALSO NEED DATA

02:14:57.289 --> 02:14:58.790
MINIMIZATION WHEN WE SAY DATA

02:14:58.857 --> 02:15:00.192
MINIMIZATION AND WE MEAN THAT

02:15:00.258 --> 02:15:02.160
LIMITING DATA COLLECTION TO THAT

02:15:02.227 --> 02:15:04.062
WHICH IS NECESSARY TO OPERATE

02:15:04.129 --> 02:15:05.330
THE SERVICE --

02:15:05.397 --> 02:15:06.832
CONSUMERS ALSO NEED GREATER

02:15:06.898 --> 02:15:08.533
CONTROL OVER DATA SHARING.

02:15:08.600 --> 02:15:10.302
ACCESS TO SPECIFIC PIECES OF

02:15:10.368 --> 02:15:12.237

02:15:14.473 --> 02:15:16.241
INFORMATION IS OLD.

02:15:16.308 --> 02:15:17.976
THAT'S WHY WE JOINED OVER THIRTY

02:15:18.043 --> 02:15:19.744
ADVOCACY GROUPS IN SUPPORTING

02:15:19.811 --> 02:15:21.813
ASSEMBLY MEMBER WEEKS IS AB

SEVENTEEN SIXTEEN WOULD WHICH

02:15:24.216 --> 02:15:25.083
WOULD ACHIEVE THESE GOALS.

02:15:25.150 --> 02:15:25.984
NO REASONABLE PERSON WOULD WANT

02:15:26.051 --> 02:15:28.019
THE MOST SENSITIVE PERSONAL

02:21:26.211 --> 02:21:28.446
THINK THAT IT'S IMPORTANT THAT.

02:21:28.513 --> 02:21:29.747
ALL COMPANIES ARE ENTRUSTED WITH

02:21:29.814 --> 02:21:31.316
CONSUMERS PERSONAL INFORMATION

02:21:31.382 --> 02:21:33.117
BE REQUIRED TO PROTECT IT.

02:21:33.184 --> 02:21:34.919
AND KEEP IT SECURE AND I THINK

02:21:34.986 --> 02:21:35.753
IT THIS WAY PARTICULAR WITH

02:21:35.820 --> 02:21:36.721
RESPECT TO THE PRIVACY

02:21:36.788 --> 02:21:38.389
PROVISIONS THE REAL CONCERN IS

02:21:38.456 --> 02:21:40.191
THAT ENFORCEMENT --

02:21:40.258 --> 02:21:43.428
JUST ISN'T ADEQUATE TO

02:21:43.494 --> 02:21:45.663
INCENTIVIZE COMPANY SUPPLIED ALL.

AND IT'S SPECIFICALLY SAID THAT --

02:22:08.319 --> 02:22:09.587

SITUATION WHERE A BUSINESS DOES

02:22:18.129 --> 02:22:20.865
EVERYTHING IS POSTED TO DO WITH

02:22:20.932 --> 02:22:21.065
THIS.

02:22:21.132 --> 02:22:22.233
YOU KNOW HACKED BY THE RUSSIANS

02:22:22.300 --> 02:22:25.503

02:22:27.038 --> 02:22:28.373
CONCERN.

HARBORS AND AND AND AND INTO THE

02:22:34.545 --> 02:22:35.680
BILL AND ALSO.

02:22:35.747 --> 02:22:35.980
IN -- MADE

02:22:36.047 --> 02:22:39.550
SURE THAT --

02:22:39.617 --> 02:22:40.785
THAT SAID THERE WAS CONSERVE YOU

FORTUNATELY KICKED IN WITH

02:22:43.154 --> 02:22:44.188
NEGLIGENT.

02:22:44.255 --> 02:22:46.624
WAIT WITH IT WITH A FINDING OF

02:22:46.691 --> 02:22:47.992
NEGLIGENCE SO I JUST WANTED.

02:22:48.059 --> 02:22:48.927
TO CLARIFY WHAT AT WHAT I SENSE

02:22:48.993 --> 02:22:51.062
WAS SOME DISCREPANCY BETWEEN

02:22:51.129 --> 02:22:52.864
YOUR YOUR TESTIMONIES.

02:22:52.931 --> 02:22:54.032
THE LINE NEED THE LOCKER AS IT'S

02:22:54.098 --> 02:22:55.400
CURRENTLY DRAFTED NEEDS TO BE

02:22:55.466 --> 02:22:57.001
ADJUSTED TO REFLECT --

02:22:57.068 --> 02:22:58.403
THAT IT WOULD EXCLUDE

02:22:58.469 --> 02:23:00.605
ENFORCEMENT IF YOUR DATA IS

02:23:00.672 --> 02:23:01.706
ENCRYPTED OR IF IT'S REACTIVE.

02:23:01.773 --> 02:23:03.174
THAT NEEDS TO BE ADJUSTED BUT

02:23:03.241 --> 02:23:04.842
EVEN IF YOU ACCOUNT FOR THAT

02:23:04.909 --> 02:23:05.810
THERE'S OBVIOUSLY STILL PLENTY

02:23:05.877 --> 02:23:07.445
OF INSTANCES WHERE THERE COULD

02:23:07.512 --> 02:23:08.947
BE AN EMPLOYEE AIR THAT LEADS.

02:23:09.013 --> 02:23:11.382
TO A BREACH OF THESE THINGS.

02:23:11.449 --> 02:23:13.418
IT COULD HAPPEN AND THE CONCERN

02:23:13.484 --> 02:23:15.186
ABOUT THE LAW THE WAY IT IS

02:23:15.253 --> 02:23:16.587
RIGHT NOW WITH RESPECT TO THE

02:23:16.654 --> 02:23:18.022
PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION IS THE

02:23:18.089 --> 02:23:18.957
FACT THAT.

02:23:19.023 --> 02:23:20.959
LIABILITIES SO GREAT BECAUSE YOU

02:23:21.025 --> 02:23:22.894
HAVE A MINIMUM OF A HUNDRED

02:23:22.961 --> 02:23:24.128
DOLLARS MAXIMUM SEVEN HUNDRED

02:23:24.195 --> 02:23:24.729
FIFTY DOLLARS PER PERSON PER

02:23:24.796 --> 02:23:25.530
INCIDENT.

02:23:25.596 --> 02:23:28.232
SO WHEN YOU HAVE A BREACH LIKE

02:23:28.299 --> 02:23:31.936
YOU'RE LOOKING AT AND OUR

02:23:32.003 --> 02:23:33.071
CONCERN IS THAT MOST COMPANIES

02:23:33.137 --> 02:23:34.272
ARE GOING TO ROLL THE DICE

02:23:34.339 --> 02:23:36.274
PEOPLE TO EXPLAIN TO A JURY YOU

02:23:36.341 --> 02:23:36.474
KNOW.

02:23:36.541 --> 02:23:38.543
WHY WHAT THEY DID WAS REASONABLE

02:23:38.609 --> 02:23:40.078
IT'S COULD BE PERCEIVED AS A

02:23:40.144 --> 02:23:41.312
MOVING TARGET?

02:23:41.379 --> 02:23:43.247
AND SO OUR BIG CONCERN IS JUST

02:23:43.314 --> 02:23:44.949
THAT IT'S GOING TO BE --

02:23:45.016 --> 02:23:46.017
YOU KNOW TOO ONEROUS IT'S JUST

02:23:46.084 --> 02:23:46.617
GOING TO LEAD TO A LOT MORE

02:23:46.684 --> 02:23:49.354
SETTLEMENTS IS NOT TO DO

02:23:49.420 --> 02:23:51.222
ANYTHING TO MAKE CONSUMER SAFER.

02:23:51.289 --> 02:23:52.924
YEAH I DID ALL I I JUST WITH

02:23:52.991 --> 02:23:54.659
WITH RESPECT I REMEMBER WHEN

02:23:54.726 --> 02:23:56.294
SENATOR DODD'S BILL CAME UP IN

02:23:56.361 --> 02:23:57.261
SOME YEAH BUSINESS FOLKS ARE

02:23:57.328 --> 02:23:58.863
RAISING CONCERNS ABOUT IT AND I

02:23:58.930 --> 02:24:02.967
I I SHARE THE THE CONCERN THAT.

02:24:03.034 --> 02:24:03.568
THE STREET GLIDE BILLETS THERE

02:24:03.634 --> 02:24:05.737
WASN'T FAIR.

02:24:05.803 --> 02:24:07.138
AND AND TALKING.

02:24:07.205 --> 02:24:08.206
TO FOLKS LIKE YOU AND OTHERS

02:24:08.272 --> 02:24:09.707
REPRESENT THE CHAMBER THERE WAS

02:24:09.774 --> 02:24:10.742
A KIND OF COMMON SENSE IS THAT

02:24:10.808 --> 02:24:11.242
THERE OUGHT TO BE AT A

02:24:11.309 --> 02:24:13.244
NEGLIGENCE STANDARD THAT WAS THE

02:24:13.311 --> 02:24:15.079
FAIR WAY OF HANDLING WHAT SENATE

02:24:15.146 --> 02:24:16.948
I WAS TRYING TO DO.

02:24:17.015 --> 02:24:19.250
WELL IF IF I MAY CENTER --

02:24:19.317 --> 02:24:20.385
WHEN WE TALK ABOUT IS THE

02:24:20.451 --> 02:24:23.121
WOMEN'S GROUP WE TALK INTO THE

02:24:23.187 --> 02:24:24.956
MICROPHONE SORRY COURSE

02:24:25.023 --> 02:24:25.256
[inaudible]

02:24:25.323 --> 02:24:26.858
THANK YOU.

02:24:26.924 --> 02:24:27.892
WHEN WITH RESPECT TO THAT LINE

02:24:27.959 --> 02:24:28.526
WITH A SOME MORE TALKING ABOUT A

02:24:28.593 --> 02:24:30.094
SAFE HARBOR WHAT WERE WHAT WERE?

02:24:30.161 --> 02:24:32.663
WOULD BE HOPING FOR IN THIS

02:24:32.730 --> 02:24:33.865
SITUATION WOULD BE SOMETHING

02:24:33.931 --> 02:24:35.333
AKIN TO THE OHIO LAW THAT

02:24:35.400 --> 02:24:36.401
RECENTLY PASSED WHERE FOR

02:24:36.467 --> 02:24:38.136
COMPANY CAN PROVE EARLIER ON IN

02:24:38.202 --> 02:24:39.470
THE LITIGATION THAT THEY HAVE

02:24:39.537 --> 02:24:40.705
CONFORMED.

02:24:40.772 --> 02:24:42.440
TO YOU KNOW RECORD NATIONALLY

02:24:42.507 --> 02:24:44.675
RECOGNIZED OUR STATE RECOGNIZED

02:24:44.742 --> 02:24:46.310
SECURITY STANDARDS.

02:24:46.377 --> 02:24:47.812
AND THEY STILL GOT HACKED ANYWAY

02:24:47.879 --> 02:24:50.548
THAT THEY COULD BE OFF THE HOOK

02:24:50.615 --> 02:24:51.949
FOR THAT ONEROUS --

02:24:52.016 --> 02:24:53.384
YOU KNOW THOSE HONOR STATUTORY

02:24:53.451 --> 02:24:56.521
DAMAGES.

02:24:56.587 --> 02:25:00.925
EVEN IF VERY EVEN IF THE EVEN IF

02:25:00.992 --> 02:25:01.492
THERE WASN'T A LEGEND SOME

02:25:01.559 --> 02:25:02.593
NEGLIGENCE IS A WELL IT JUST

02:25:02.660 --> 02:25:03.961
IT'S A WAY TO RESOLVE LITIGATION

02:25:04.028 --> 02:25:05.696
EARLIER AND TO NOT HAVE TO GO

02:25:05.763 --> 02:25:07.331
THROUGH ALL THE EXORBITANT COSTS

02:25:07.398 --> 02:25:09.100
OF EDISCOVERY YOU KNOW FOR A

02:25:09.167 --> 02:25:09.867
BIGGER COMPANY YOU'RE TALKING

02:25:09.934 --> 02:25:11.235
LIKE IT HER THOUSAND DOLLARS.

02:25:11.302 --> 02:25:12.770
FOR EDISCOVERY AND SO WHAT WE'RE

02:25:12.837 --> 02:25:14.038
JUST WORRIED ABOUT IS THAT

02:25:14.105 --> 02:25:14.639
COMPANIES ANY LEVERAGE INTO

02:25:14.705 --> 02:25:15.606
IMMEDIATE SETTLEMENT WHETHER

02:25:15.673 --> 02:25:16.974
THEY HAVE A GOOD ARGUMENT OR NOT.

02:25:17.041 --> 02:25:19.477
CONSIDERING HOW ONEROUS THE

02:25:19.544 --> 02:25:21.679
LIABILITY IS.

02:25:21.746 --> 02:25:23.147
WE HEAR THIS ARGUMENT ALL THE

02:25:23.214 --> 02:25:24.082
TIME FROM THE CHAMBER OF

02:25:24.148 --> 02:25:25.516
COMMERCE IT DOESN'T LIKE PRIVATE

02:25:25.583 --> 02:25:27.085
RIGHT OF ACTION BECAUSE IT

02:25:27.151 --> 02:25:28.453
ALLOWS PEOPLE TO ENFORCE THE

02:25:28.519 --> 02:25:29.487
RIGHTS THE THOUGHT THE THOUGHT

02:25:29.554 --> 02:25:31.122
OF EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND

02:25:31.189 --> 02:25:32.156
DOLLARS FOR DISCOVERY.

02:25:32.223 --> 02:25:33.091
WITH A COMPANY LIKE APPLE OR

02:25:33.157 --> 02:25:36.594
GOOGLE IS KIND OF LAUGHABLE THEY

02:25:36.661 --> 02:25:38.496
PROBABLY SPENT EIGHT HUNDRED

02:25:38.563 --> 02:25:39.730
THOUSAND DOLLARS ON THEIR OFFICE

02:25:39.797 --> 02:25:41.666
CHRISTMAS PARTY IN MOUNTAIN VIEW

02:25:41.732 --> 02:25:44.836
SO -- THAT --

02:25:44.902 --> 02:25:46.204
I DON'T THINK THAT ARGUMENT

02:25:46.270 --> 02:25:48.206
HOLDS MUCH WATER BUT BUT CENTER

02:25:48.272 --> 02:25:50.241
ALLEN YEAH SO THAT I'M CERTAINLY

02:25:50.308 --> 02:25:51.175
MISS IN GETTING THAT --

02:25:51.242 --> 02:25:52.210
BACK BETTER CLARIFY YOU MAYBE

02:25:52.276 --> 02:25:53.211
IT'S A QUESTION OF MAKING SURE

02:25:53.277 --> 02:25:53.811
THAT.

02:25:53.878 --> 02:25:56.114
YOU KNOW THAT THE LAW DOESN'T

02:25:56.180 --> 02:25:57.782
ALLOW FOR WHAT ARE TRULY FISHING

02:25:57.849 --> 02:25:59.750
EXPEDITIONS BUT THAT THAT THERE

02:25:59.817 --> 02:26:01.752
IS AN OPPORTUNITY --

02:26:01.819 --> 02:26:02.687
FOR FOR FOLKS WHO ACTED

02:26:02.753 --> 02:26:04.322
NEGLIGENTLY TO BE HELD

02:26:04.388 --> 02:26:05.456
ACCOUNTABLE BECAUSE I THINK THAT

02:26:05.523 --> 02:26:06.858
YOU KNOW AT LEAST WITHIN THE

02:26:06.924 --> 02:26:07.692
CONTEXT OF SENATOR DODD BILL WE

02:26:07.759 --> 02:26:08.292
CAN ALL AGREE THAT WAS A GOOD

02:26:08.359 --> 02:26:09.494
STANDARD.

02:26:09.560 --> 02:26:10.161
ON THE OTHER QUESTION I WANT TO

02:26:10.228 --> 02:26:11.095
ASK YOU.

02:26:11.162 --> 02:26:12.697
I WAS A LITTLE CONFUSED MY

02:26:12.763 --> 02:26:14.932
UNDERSTANDING IS THAT CONSUMER

02:26:14.999 --> 02:26:20.771
IS DEFINED AS AN ACTUAL PERSON.

02:26:20.838 --> 02:26:22.106
I AM SO THAT ELISE WITHIN THE

02:26:22.173 --> 02:26:22.673
CONTEXT OF THIS IT WOULDN'T

02:26:22.740 --> 02:26:23.608
APPLY TO BUSINESS TO BUSINESS

02:26:23.674 --> 02:26:25.143
INTERACTIONS AND I I THINK YOU.

02:26:25.209 --> 02:26:26.277
IMPLIED THAT A MAYBE I'M NOT

02:26:26.344 --> 02:26:27.278
UNDERSTANDING ALL THE

02:26:27.345 --> 02:26:28.779
APPLICATIONS FOR CONSUMER IS YES

02:26:28.846 --> 02:26:29.981
A CALIFORNIA RESIDENT BUT IT

02:26:30.047 --> 02:26:32.049
COULD BE A PERSON IT'S ACTING IN

02:26:32.116 --> 02:26:33.918
THEIR CAPACITY AS SOMEBODY

02:26:33.985 --> 02:26:35.219
REPRESENTING A BUSINESS.

02:26:35.286 --> 02:26:36.654
AND SO YOU CAN HAVE A SITUATION

02:26:36.721 --> 02:26:37.955
WHERE TWO COMPANIES AREN'T INTO

02:26:38.022 --> 02:26:39.590
ENGAGING IN A TRANSACTION ONE

02:26:39.657 --> 02:26:41.092
COMPANIES DOING DUE DILIGENCE ON

02:26:41.159 --> 02:26:42.059
ANOTHER THEY'RE HAVING TO DEAL

02:26:42.126 --> 02:26:42.693
WITH EACH OTHER.

02:26:42.760 --> 02:26:45.096
AND ONE PERSON CAN SAY HEY.

02:26:45.163 --> 02:26:46.230
GIVE ME ALL THE INFORMATION YOU

02:26:46.297 --> 02:26:47.098
HAVE ON YOUR DELETE MY

02:26:47.165 --> 02:26:48.566
INFORMATION IF THEY IF SOMETHING

02:26:48.633 --> 02:26:50.001
GOES WRONG IN THE BUSINESS DEAL

02:26:50.067 --> 02:26:51.335
IS IS JUST ONE EXAMPLE THEY

02:26:51.402 --> 02:26:52.470
THINK THE OTHER EXAMPLE I GAVE

02:26:52.537 --> 02:26:52.837
WAS.

02:26:52.904 --> 02:26:54.005
JUST THAT YOU COULD HAVE YOU

02:26:54.071 --> 02:26:55.273
KNOW A SUPPLIER THAT WANTS TO

02:26:55.339 --> 02:26:56.607
MESS WITH SOMEBODY SAY HEY GIVE

02:26:56.674 --> 02:26:57.508
ME ALL THIS INFORMATION IT'S

02:26:57.575 --> 02:26:58.543
JUST A WHOLE IT'S THE POINT IS

02:26:58.609 --> 02:27:00.111
IT'S IT'S SOMETHING THAT WAS

02:27:00.178 --> 02:27:02.346
NEVER CONTEMPLATED BY THIS THIS

02:27:02.413 --> 02:27:03.814
LAW WAS INTENDED TO COVER TRUE

02:27:03.881 --> 02:27:05.750
CONSUMERS --

02:27:05.816 --> 02:27:06.984
AND IT'S JUST THE CONSEQUENCE OF

02:27:07.051 --> 02:27:08.152

DEFINITION OF A CONSUMER BECAUSE

02:27:30.241 --> 02:27:31.909

DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE CONSUMER.

ON LANGUAGE TO ACHIEVE THEM.

02:28:50.054 --> 02:28:51.455
AS SENATOR ALLEN AND I COULD IF

I COULD DIRECT TO PAGE SEVEN OF

02:28:53.357 --> 02:28:56.093
THE ANALYSIS THAT WAS DONE THE

02:28:56.160 --> 02:28:57.928
BACKGROUND PAPER --

02:28:57.995 --> 02:29:00.998
IT DOES SHE A REFERENCE THIS --

02:29:01.065 --> 02:29:02.700
THE OBLIGATIONS IMPOSED ON

02:29:02.767 --> 02:29:04.402
BUSINESSES DO NOT RESTRICT THE

02:29:04.468 --> 02:29:06.137
BUSINESSES ABILITY TO DO AND

02:29:06.203 --> 02:29:07.638
THERE ARE A NUMBER OF POINTS OUT

02:29:07.705 --> 02:29:09.140
THERE SO --

02:29:09.206 --> 02:29:10.875
THAT TO HOPEFULLY.

AND BUT IT WILL BE --

02:29:24.188 --> 02:29:26.624
EXTRAORDINARILY DETRIMENTAL TO

02:29:26.691 --> 02:29:29.593
MOVING THIS ISSUE FORWARD IF WE

02:29:29.660 --> 02:29:36.133
TRY TO CRAWL UNDER EVERY ROCK.

02:29:36.200 --> 02:29:37.768

02:29:47.912 --> 02:29:48.946
ABOUT SO.

02:29:49.013 --> 02:29:51.115
THE FACT THAT IT OCCURRED WITH

ONE WEEK BEFORE THE END THE

02:29:52.116 --> 02:29:54.051

WELL -- THAT

02:29:55.119 --> 02:29:57.221

02:30:00.391 --> 02:30:01.425
AMOUNT OF MONEY ON ATTORNEYS

02:30:01.492 --> 02:30:03.794

LEGISLATION YEAH I MEAN THE

02:30:16.540 --> 02:30:17.108
ARGUMENT THEY'RE MAKING THEM IS

02:30:17.174 --> 02:30:17.308
THAT.

02:30:17.375 --> 02:30:18.743
THERE WAS VERY LITTLE TIME THEY

02:30:18.809 --> 02:30:19.443
MADE A DEAL --

02:30:19.510 --> 02:30:21.245

THE FUNDAMENTALS OF BILLY

OPERATING IN SOCIETY TODAY ARE

02:47:49.192 --> 02:47:52.061
SO DEPENDENT ON TECHNOLOGY AND

02:47:52.128 --> 02:47:53.062
FOR JUST DAY TO DAY

02:47:53.129 --> 02:47:54.697
FUNCTIONALITY.

02:47:54.764 --> 02:47:56.599
AND BEYOND OF DAY TO DAY

02:47:56.666 --> 02:47:59.469
FUNCTIONALITY I'M THINKING ABOUT.

02:47:59.536 --> 02:48:01.738
THE WAYS IN WHICH I INNOVATION

02:48:01.805 --> 02:48:04.007
IS HAPPENING IN WAYS THAT BUT

02:48:04.073 --> 02:48:06.042
THAT AS A SOCIETY I THINK WE

02:48:06.109 --> 02:48:07.377
WANT TO KEEP IN MIND.

02:48:07.444 --> 02:48:09.078
AS WE HAVE THIS DISCUSSION AT

02:48:09.145 --> 02:48:10.847
THAT'S BEEN KICKED OFF BY THE

02:48:10.914 --> 02:48:11.848
SEA CPA.

02:48:11.915 --> 02:48:15.251
I'VE BEEN PRACTICING SINCE

02:48:15.318 --> 02:48:15.885
NINETEEN NINETY ONE AND MY VERY

02:48:15.952 --> 02:48:17.754
FIRST A INTRODUCTION TO PRIVACY

02:48:17.821 --> 02:48:19.656
WAS IN LAW SCHOOL IN NINETEEN

02:48:19.722 --> 02:48:21.024
NINETY WHERE I TOOK A CLASS WITH

02:48:21.090 --> 02:48:23.359
PROFESSOR ANITA ALLEN ON PRIVACY

02:48:23.426 --> 02:48:24.594
AND AMERICAN LAW.

02:48:24.661 --> 02:48:26.095
AND AT THAT TIME WE WERE FOCUSED

02:48:26.162 --> 02:48:27.997
ON THE PUBLIC EXPOSURE OF THE

02:48:28.064 --> 02:48:29.866
PRIVATE LIVES OF POLITICIANS AND

02:48:29.933 --> 02:48:31.534
I WROTE MY PAPER ON

02:48:31.601 --> 02:48:33.570
REPRESENTATIVES OF FRANK.

02:48:33.636 --> 02:48:35.371
BUT LEAVING WE'VE EVOLVED SO

02:48:35.438 --> 02:48:39.909
MUCH --

02:48:39.976 --> 02:48:41.211
SINCE THAT TIME AND I THINK AND

02:48:41.277 --> 02:48:45.114
THE AND YEARS I'VE DEDICATED TO

02:48:45.181 --> 02:48:46.583
PRIVACY AND DATA SECURITY.

02:48:46.649 --> 02:48:48.985
THE LEVEL OF INTEREST AND

02:48:49.052 --> 02:48:50.053
EXCITEMENT --

02:48:50.119 --> 02:48:51.788
THAT I SEE AROUND HOW NEW

02:48:51.855 --> 02:48:54.524
TECHNOLOGIES I CAN BE USED AND

02:48:54.591 --> 02:48:55.825
LEVERAGE AND SOCIETY.

02:48:55.892 --> 02:48:57.327
SO I WANT TO TALK ABOUT SOME

02:48:57.393 --> 02:48:58.428
THINGS THAT THAT I PERSONALLY

02:48:58.495 --> 02:48:59.963
EXPERIENCEIN THE PAST YEAR TO

02:49:00.029 --> 02:49:01.097
GIVE YOU SOME SENSE.

02:49:01.164 --> 02:49:02.899
OF A WAS LUCKY ENOUGH TO

02:49:02.966 --> 02:49:03.900
MODERATE A PANEL FOR THE

02:49:06.336 --> 02:49:07.437
IN VIRGINIA.

02:49:07.504 --> 02:49:09.172
AND THERE I HEARD SOME VERY

02:49:09.239 --> 02:49:10.907
EXCITING TEST YOU KNOW STORIES

02:49:10.974 --> 02:49:11.875
FROM.

02:49:11.941 --> 02:49:13.643
MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS ABOUT THE

02:49:13.710 --> 02:49:14.377
WAY THAT THEY'RE USING

02:49:14.444 --> 02:49:16.246
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TO BE

02:49:16.312 --> 02:49:18.181
ABLE TO COORDINATE MULTIPLE

02:49:18.248 --> 02:49:20.183
PATTERNS AND BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY

02:49:20.250 --> 02:49:22.519
YOU JUST BY USING RETINAL SCANS.

02:49:22.585 --> 02:49:24.988
AND OTHER INFORMATION WHETHER A

02:49:25.054 --> 02:49:26.756
CHILD AT THE AGE OF TWELVE CAN

02:49:26.823 --> 02:49:28.191
BE HAVE THE PREDICTIVE JEAN TO

02:49:28.258 --> 02:49:29.759
SHOW THAT THEY HAVE THEY WILL

02:49:29.826 --> 02:49:31.928
HAVE A CUT UP VERY RARE FORM OF

02:49:31.995 --> 02:49:33.563
DIABETES THAT WOULD RENDER THAT

02:49:33.630 --> 02:49:34.364
CHILD.

02:49:34.430 --> 02:49:35.999
BLIND AND BE ABLE TO TAKE

02:49:36.065 --> 02:49:38.668
PREVENTATIVE STEPS AHEAD OF TIME

02:49:38.735 --> 02:49:40.203
TO AVOID THAT.

02:49:40.270 --> 02:49:42.872
THAT'S TRANSFORMATIVE YOU KNOW --

02:49:42.939 --> 02:49:44.407
I'M THINKING ABOUT CLINTON DEAL

02:49:44.474 --> 02:49:45.909
HIGH SCHOOL THAT I READ ABOUT

02:49:45.975 --> 02:49:48.011
WHEN I WAS ON VACATION IN COSTA

02:49:48.077 --> 02:49:49.879
RICA IN DECEMBER.

02:49:49.946 --> 02:49:54.150
AND IT WHERE A PRINCIPAL GREG

02:49:54.217 --> 02:49:55.084
ALLEN.

02:49:55.151 --> 02:49:55.985
TAKE THE TIME TO LOOK AT THE

02:49:56.052 --> 02:49:57.086
SITUATION WHERE HIS THE KIDS IN

02:49:57.153 --> 02:49:57.720
THE SCHOOL WERE.

02:49:57.787 --> 02:49:59.622
AS THINKING AND FAILING AND NOT

02:49:59.689 --> 02:50:01.991
PASSING COURSES BECAUSE OF THE

02:50:02.058 --> 02:50:03.860
DISRUPTION WE TALKED EARLIER

02:50:03.927 --> 02:50:05.128
ABOUT THE AUTO INDUSTRY RIGHT SO.

02:50:05.194 --> 02:50:06.663
IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT WHEN THERE

02:50:06.729 --> 02:50:07.564
WAS THAT DOWNTURN THERE WASA

02:50:07.630 --> 02:50:10.567
MAJOR ECONOMIC IMPACT IN DETROIT

02:50:10.633 --> 02:50:12.101
AND THEY THE LOW INCOME

02:50:12.168 --> 02:50:13.236
COMMUNITY THAT.

02:50:13.303 --> 02:50:14.404
WAS ON ITS WAY TO LOSE THEIR

02:50:14.470 --> 02:50:17.240
HIGH SCHOOL SCHOOL WAS ABLETO

02:50:17.307 --> 02:50:19.876
TRANSFORM THAT SITUATION.

02:50:19.943 --> 02:50:21.911
THROUGH TECHNOLOGY WHERE --

02:50:21.978 --> 02:50:23.246
AND I READ ABOUT THIS IN OF A

02:50:23.313 --> 02:50:24.547
BOOK CALLED GREAT AT WORK THAT

02:50:24.614 --> 02:50:26.382
WAS WRITTEN BY MORE ENHANCE IN

02:50:26.449 --> 02:50:27.817
HERE IN THE BAY AREA.

02:50:27.884 --> 02:50:29.986
BUT HE USE THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF

02:50:30.053 --> 02:50:31.554
HOW INNOVATION AND THINKING

02:50:31.621 --> 02:50:33.156
OUTSIDE OF THE BOX FOR THIS

02:50:33.222 --> 02:50:35.358
PRINCIPLE TOOK THE TIME. TO AND

02:50:35.425 --> 02:50:36.859
THROUGH TECHNOLOGY TO RESEARCH

02:50:36.926 --> 02:50:38.261
HOW THE STUDENTS CAN COULD

02:50:38.328 --> 02:50:40.563
ACTUALLY TAKE LESSONS AND WATCH

02:50:40.630 --> 02:50:43.333
VIDEO REMOTELY TO LEARN AND THEN

02:50:43.399 --> 02:50:44.801
COME INTO THE CLASSROOM WHERE

02:50:44.867 --> 02:50:45.935
YOU KNOW UNFORTUNATELY THEIR

02:50:46.002 --> 02:50:47.470
PARENTS WERE DISTRACTED WITH THE

02:50:47.537 --> 02:50:48.905
HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT RATES AND JUST

02:50:48.972 --> 02:50:50.940
NOT IN A POSITION. TO MENTOR

02:50:51.007 --> 02:50:51.975
THOSE KIDS WITH THEIR HOMEWORK

02:50:52.041 --> 02:50:53.843
AND THAT IS NOT THAT IS WHY THEY

02:50:53.910 --> 02:50:56.045
WERE NOT EXCELLING AND SO TO USE

02:50:56.112 --> 02:50:57.313
THE CLASSROOM TIME INFLICT THAT

02:50:57.380 --> 02:50:58.748
CAL CLASSROOM.

02:50:58.815 --> 02:51:00.116
SO THAT THE KIDS CAN ACTUALLY

02:51:00.183 --> 02:51:02.285
LEARN AND TO THE POINT NOW WHERE

02:51:02.352 --> 02:51:04.821
THEY HAVE A 94% GRADUATION RATE

02:51:04.887 --> 02:51:05.755
I MEAN.

02:51:05.822 --> 02:51:07.457
THAT'S TRANSFORMATIVE THAT'S

02:51:07.523 --> 02:51:09.659
WHAT TECHNOLOGY WAS ABLE TO

02:51:09.726 --> 02:51:10.760
ACHIEVE.

02:51:10.827 --> 02:51:13.496
I'M LOOKING AT YOU KNOW THE

02:51:13.563 --> 02:51:15.098
CITIES THAT ARE AROUND THE

02:51:15.164 --> 02:51:16.199
COUNTRY AND GLOW OF THEIR

02:51:16.265 --> 02:51:17.567
INVOLVED IN SMART CITY

02:51:17.634 --> 02:51:18.835
DISCUSSIONS.

02:51:18.901 --> 02:51:20.603
AND HOUSTON IN TWENTY TWO OTHER

02:51:20.670 --> 02:51:21.537
CITIES THAT ARE LOOKING AT

02:51:21.604 --> 02:51:24.140
THINGS THAT INVOLVE NOT JUST ON

02:51:24.207 --> 02:51:27.310
USING TECHNOLOGY.

02:51:27.377 --> 02:51:28.945
FOR TRACKING AND FOR SAFETY

02:51:29.012 --> 02:51:30.713
PURPOSES BUT ALSO TO USE

02:51:30.780 --> 02:51:32.281
TECHNOLOGY.

02:51:32.348 --> 02:51:33.483
TO BRING THINGS LIKE WIFI INTO

02:51:33.549 --> 02:51:34.884
PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION BECAUSE

02:51:34.951 --> 02:51:37.320
THERE ARE A VAST NUMBER OF THE

02:51:37.387 --> 02:51:38.855
PEOPLE IN OUR SOCIETY WHO CANNOT.

02:51:38.921 --> 02:51:42.692
WHO CANNOT ALONE AND DRIVE A CAR

02:51:42.759 --> 02:51:44.594
AND THAT WE?

02:51:44.661 --> 02:51:47.397
AND I'M THINKING OF WHERE'S THAT

02:51:47.463 --> 02:51:49.999
HAS TAKEN A MAJOR HIT AS YOU

02:51:50.066 --> 02:51:52.402
KNOW IN ON TERMS OF PEOPLE.

02:51:52.468 --> 02:51:54.170
MAKING SALES AND ACTUALLY

02:51:54.237 --> 02:51:55.672
SHOWING UP IN PHYSICAL STORES.

02:51:55.738 --> 02:51:57.473
AND HOW THEY'RE USING INNOVATIVE

02:51:57.540 --> 02:51:59.742
TECHNOLOGIES TO IF YOU CAN GO

02:51:59.809 --> 02:52:01.077
INTO A PHYSICAL STORE OR

02:52:01.144 --> 02:52:03.112
DOWNLOAD AN APP AND SEE HOW THAT

02:52:03.179 --> 02:52:04.347
MAKE UP WITH LOOK ON YOUR FACE

02:52:04.414 --> 02:52:04.714
SIR.

02:52:04.781 --> 02:52:06.649
AT CLOSE THAT MIGHT SUGGEST THAT

02:52:06.716 --> 02:52:08.851
YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN A WAY

02:52:08.918 --> 02:52:09.952
TO TO KEEP BUSINESS.

02:52:10.019 --> 02:52:11.387
IN CALIFORNIA AND IN OTHER

02:52:11.454 --> 02:52:12.789
LOCATIONS.

02:52:12.855 --> 02:52:14.824
I'M THINKING ABOUT ALSO WITH THE

02:52:14.891 --> 02:52:16.592
MARGINS BEING WHAT THEY ARE HOW

02:52:16.659 --> 02:52:17.894
IMPORTANT MACHINE LEARNING

02:52:17.960 --> 02:52:19.362
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND

02:52:19.429 --> 02:52:21.864
THOSE THINGS ARE FUELED BY LOTS

02:52:21.931 --> 02:52:23.166
OF DATA TO MAKE SURE THAT THE

02:52:23.232 --> 02:52:24.634
MODELS AND PREDICTIVE MODELS

02:52:24.701 --> 02:52:25.368
WORK.

02:52:25.435 --> 02:52:27.937
THAT PREDICTIVE ALGORITHMS THAT

02:52:28.004 --> 02:52:29.706
CAN BE USED TO YOU.

02:52:29.772 --> 02:52:31.274
SEE WHEN YEARS WHEN YOU ARE OVER

02:52:31.340 --> 02:52:32.542
ORDERING AND THE STOCK SUPPLY

02:52:32.608 --> 02:52:34.610
DOESN'T NEED TO BE ORDERED TO

02:52:34.677 --> 02:52:35.745
THAT LEVEL.

02:52:35.812 --> 02:52:37.980
AND THEREBY BUT EVEN WITHOUT

02:52:38.047 --> 02:52:39.649
INCREASE SALES BEING ABLE TO

02:52:39.716 --> 02:52:41.484
KEEP BUSINESS LIKE RETAILERS IN

02:52:41.551 --> 02:52:42.485
THE IN.

02:52:42.552 --> 02:52:43.853
THE RUNNING AND IT HAPPENED IN

02:52:43.920 --> 02:52:45.455
CREATING JOBS BECAUSE THEY'RE

02:52:45.521 --> 02:52:47.757
ABLE TO YOU REDUCE THEIR MARGINS

02:52:47.824 --> 02:52:48.291
AND WE HAD AN AND A VERY

02:52:48.357 --> 02:52:49.459
INTERESTING.

02:52:49.525 --> 02:52:50.860
DISCUSSION ABOUT THAT IN OUR

02:52:50.927 --> 02:52:52.328
OFFICE WHEN --

02:52:52.395 --> 02:52:54.564
A VENDOR PANORAMIC CAME IN AND

02:52:54.630 --> 02:52:59.202
EXPLAINED WHAT THEY WERE DOING.

02:52:59.268 --> 02:53:00.636
I'M THINKING ABOUT YOU KNOW.

02:53:00.703 --> 02:53:02.105
THE MICO BUSINESSES THAT EXIST

02:53:02.171 --> 02:53:03.272
NOT JUST YOU KNOW A BRIDE IN

02:53:03.339 --> 02:53:05.441
ASIA AFRICA MIDDLE EAST BUT ALSO

02:53:05.508 --> 02:53:07.376
RIGHT HERE IN CALIFORNIA.

02:53:07.443 --> 02:53:08.678
THAT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN

02:53:08.745 --> 02:53:10.913
VISIBILITY AND GOODS AND WEARS

02:53:10.980 --> 02:53:12.448
WOULD NOT BE VISIBLE A LOT OF

02:53:12.515 --> 02:53:13.783
THEM WOMEN OWNED BUSINESSES

02:53:13.850 --> 02:53:15.451
WOULD NOT BE SEEN BUT FOR THE

02:53:15.518 --> 02:53:17.820
INTERNET BUT FOR MOBILE PAYMENTS

02:53:17.887 --> 02:53:18.621
BUT FOR APPS.

02:53:18.688 --> 02:53:20.022
AND NOT TO MENTION THE GIG

02:53:20.089 --> 02:53:22.258
ECONOMY WHERE SO MANY ARTISTS

02:53:22.325 --> 02:53:23.259
AND OTHERS ARE ABLE TO YOU OF

02:53:23.326 --> 02:53:26.195
MOONLIGHT DOING OTHER JOBS AND

02:53:26.262 --> 02:53:27.964
KEEP THEMSELVES AFLOAT.

02:53:28.030 --> 02:53:30.399
AT THIS IS NOT JUST A CALIFORNIA

02:53:30.466 --> 02:53:31.501
ISSUE -- I

02:53:31.567 --> 02:53:32.869
AND IT'S NOT JUST AN E. YOU

02:53:32.935 --> 02:53:35.404
ISSUE I SPENT THE BETTER PART IS

02:53:35.471 --> 02:53:36.839
A SAID AS YOU KNOW THE PAST.

02:53:36.906 --> 02:53:38.040
AT TWENTY SEVEN YEARS TO

02:53:38.107 --> 02:53:41.611
THINKING ABOUT REALIZED AND THIS

02:53:41.677 --> 02:53:43.346
IS TIMELY BECAUSE THAT UGANDA

02:53:43.412 --> 02:53:44.914
JUST PAST THEIR DATA PROTECTION

02:53:44.981 --> 02:53:45.915
LAW BECOMING.

02:53:45.982 --> 02:53:47.583
THE OVER ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY

02:53:47.650 --> 02:53:49.252
COUNTRIES NOW THAT HAVE DATA

02:53:49.318 --> 02:53:50.720
PROTECTION POLICIES.

02:53:50.787 --> 02:53:53.422
EVERY DAY I REPRESENT BUSINESS

02:53:53.489 --> 02:53:55.825
THAT IS TRYING TO GET THIS RIGHT

02:53:55.892 --> 02:53:58.361
BUT IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT

02:53:58.427 --> 02:54:00.096
WHEN WE HAVE THIS DISCUSSION.

02:54:00.163 --> 02:54:02.698
THAT WE ALL LOOK AT THE PATH

02:54:02.765 --> 02:54:04.834
FORWARD UP THROUGH CONSIDERING

02:54:04.901 --> 02:54:07.470
DATA. FOR EVERYONE AS A PRE

02:54:07.537 --> 02:54:09.605
TANGIBLE ASSET AND WHEN I SAY

02:54:09.672 --> 02:54:11.440
PRE TANGIBLE AN ASSET I MEAN

02:54:11.507 --> 02:54:12.141
THAT.

02:54:12.208 --> 02:54:14.510
THE POWER OF DATA THE ABILITY OF

02:54:14.577 --> 02:54:16.245
DATA AND THE VALUE OF DATA HAS

02:54:16.312 --> 02:54:18.514
NOT REALLY BEEN FOUGHT THROUGH

02:54:18.581 --> 02:54:20.650
ENTIRELY.

02:54:20.716 --> 02:54:21.918
IMITATE WHAT I MEAN BY THAT.

02:54:21.984 --> 02:54:24.520
CONSUMERS NEED TO THINK ABOUT

02:54:24.587 --> 02:54:26.355
WHAT THE VALUE OF DATA MEANS TO

02:54:26.422 --> 02:54:28.191
THEM.

02:54:28.257 --> 02:54:30.126
IT'S VERY DIFFERENT DISCUSSION

02:54:30.193 --> 02:54:32.962
BETWEEN US IN THIS ROOM OR EVEN

02:54:33.029 --> 02:54:34.597
IN ALL UE RESPECT MR Và

02:54:34.664 --> 02:54:36.132
TAGGART.

02:54:36.199 --> 02:54:38.067
AND SAY THE CHEN Z. A GROUP AND

02:54:38.134 --> 02:54:39.435
SOCIETY THAT ARE BETWEEN THE

02:54:39.502 --> 02:54:42.004
AGES OF FOURTEEN AND TWENTY FOUR

02:54:42.071 --> 02:54:43.339
THIS IS THE FIRST IS THE FIRST

02:54:43.406 --> 02:54:45.274
GENERATION BORNINTO THE DIGITAL

02:54:45.341 --> 02:54:46.108
AGE.

02:54:46.175 --> 02:54:47.810
THEY WERE BORN WITH AS YOU KNOW

02:54:47.877 --> 02:54:51.414
DIGITIZATION IN WAYS THAT NONE

02:54:51.480 --> 02:54:52.782
OF US WERE.

02:54:52.849 --> 02:54:54.217
THEIR CONCEPT OF PRIVACY AND

02:54:54.283 --> 02:54:55.451
WITH THE CONSIDER TO BE

02:54:55.518 --> 02:54:57.787
PROTECTED IS VERY DIFFERENT THAN

02:54:57.854 --> 02:54:59.355
SAY YOU KNOW MANY OF US MIGHT

02:54:59.422 --> 02:55:00.590
FEEL IN THIS ROOM.

02:55:00.656 --> 02:55:02.325
THE VALUE PROPOSITION TO THOSE

02:55:02.391 --> 02:55:04.527
CONSUMERS OF WHAT THEY DECIDE TO

02:55:04.594 --> 02:55:07.296
PLACE ON TO THE INTERNET SHARE.

02:55:07.363 --> 02:55:08.431
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT.

02:55:08.497 --> 02:55:09.532
THAT WE NEED TO HAVE A

02:55:09.599 --> 02:55:11.667
CONVERSATION ABOUT THE OBVIOUSLY

02:55:11.734 --> 02:55:12.935
UNDERSTAND THE REPERCUSSIONS OF

02:55:13.002 --> 02:55:13.936
WEATHER PERMITTING.

02:55:14.003 --> 02:55:15.605
BUT UNDERSTANDING THE VALUE

02:55:15.671 --> 02:55:17.173
PROPOSITIONS CAN SHIFT.

02:55:17.240 --> 02:55:19.675
I'MREMINDED OF A SHIREY CAFE I

02:55:19.742 --> 02:55:20.977
WENT TO BROWN UNIVERSITY AND I

02:55:21.043 --> 02:55:22.612
READ ABOUT THIS IN THE STATE IS

02:55:22.678 --> 02:55:24.180
ALL INFORMATION I'VE LEARNED IN

02:55:24.247 --> 02:55:25.815
THE PAST YEAR GUYS --

02:55:25.882 --> 02:55:27.149
YOU KNOW IT I READ ABOUT SHARPER

02:55:27.216 --> 02:55:29.518
CAFE.

02:55:29.585 --> 02:55:31.320
IN ASIAN BASED CORPORATION.

02:55:31.387 --> 02:55:33.089
MOVES INTO A CAFE A SITUATION A

02:55:33.155 --> 02:55:35.358
BROWN SAID ALMOST 75% OF THE

02:55:35.424 --> 02:55:36.859
STUDENTS HAVE SIGNED UP.

02:55:36.926 --> 02:55:37.927
WHEN THEY GO IN TO GET A COFFEE

02:55:37.994 --> 02:55:39.228
YEARS AGO AND THEY DO NOT PAY

02:55:39.295 --> 02:55:42.298
CASH THEY AGREED TO PAY WITH

02:55:42.365 --> 02:55:45.134
THEIR DATA ON WHY BECAUSE THEY

02:55:45.201 --> 02:55:47.336
THE CAFE IS SPONSORED BY?

02:55:47.403 --> 02:55:49.472
CORPORATIONS THAT ARE USING THE

02:55:49.538 --> 02:55:50.940
DATA TO BE ABLE TO DECIDE.

02:55:51.007 --> 02:55:54.977
SELECT CERTAIN STUDENTS FOR HAD

02:55:55.044 --> 02:55:58.214
MADE THE DECISION THEY WOULD-RATHER HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO

02:55:58.281 --> 02:55:59.916
TAKE A FREE COFFEE SIT WITH

02:55:59.982 --> 02:56:01.284
THEIR FRIENDS AND HAVE THE

02:56:01.350 --> 02:56:03.252
OPPORTUNITY TO GET THEIR DREAM

02:56:03.319 --> 02:56:04.020
JOB.

02:56:04.086 --> 02:56:06.856
AND WHO ARE WE AS A SOCIETY TO

02:56:06.923 --> 02:56:08.624
NOT ALLOW THOSE SORTS OF FRANK

02:56:08.691 --> 02:56:10.326
TRANSACTIONS.

02:56:10.393 --> 02:56:12.762
IF WE WANT --

02:56:12.828 --> 02:56:14.096
TO TO ALLOW SORT OF YOU KNOW

02:56:14.163 --> 02:56:15.831
INDEPENDENCE SO I THINK WHAT WE

02:56:15.898 --> 02:56:18.968
NEED TO DO IS THE CONVERSATION

02:56:19.035 --> 02:56:19.468
I'VE BEEN LISTENING VERY

02:56:19.535 --> 02:56:21.237
CAREFULLY.

02:56:21.304 --> 02:56:23.105
HAS OUR I THINK.

02:56:23.172 --> 02:56:25.074
WHAT WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT IT

02:56:25.141 --> 02:56:27.276
EVERYBODY'S ROLE IN THE

02:56:27.343 --> 02:56:29.178
CONVERSATION SO THAT MEANS THAT

02:56:29.245 --> 02:56:30.913
IT'S NOT JUST A BUSINESS

02:56:30.980 --> 02:56:32.882
DISCUSSION IT'S NOT JUST A A

02:56:32.949 --> 02:56:34.483
COMPLIANCE DISCUSSION THIS IS A?

02:56:34.550 --> 02:56:36.118
WE CAN USE THE CATALYST OF THE

02:56:36.185 --> 02:56:37.520
CALIFORNIA LAW AND YOU'RE RIGHT

02:56:37.586 --> 02:56:38.721
THE GLOBE IS LOOKING AT

02:56:38.788 --> 02:56:40.589
CALIFORNIA I AM GETTING CALLS

02:56:40.656 --> 02:56:43.559
FROM JAPAN THE E. U..

02:56:43.626 --> 02:56:45.227
AFRICA WANTING TO KNOW WHAT

02:56:45.294 --> 02:56:46.395
WE'RE DOING BECAUSE THEY ARE ALL

02:56:46.462 --> 02:56:48.998
DOING BUSINESS IN OUR ECONOMY.

02:56:49.065 --> 02:56:50.299
AND SO WE NEED TO THINK VERY

02:56:50.366 --> 02:56:51.801
CAREFULLY ABOUT THE DIFFERENT

02:56:51.867 --> 02:56:53.803
STAKEHOLDERS AND HOPING PEOPLE

02:56:53.869 --> 02:56:55.237
TO BEGIN TO THINK ABOUT THE

02:56:55.304 --> 02:56:56.772
VALUE PROPOSITION.

02:56:56.839 --> 02:56:57.740
I THINK IT BE A MISTAKE TO

02:56:57.807 --> 02:56:59.775
ASSUME THAT CONSUMERS HAVE MADE

02:56:59.842 --> 02:57:01.377
THIS VALUE PROPOSITION THAT

02:57:01.444 --> 02:57:03.479
DISCUSSION AND IS ALSO A MISTAKE

02:57:03.546 --> 02:57:05.047
TO ASSUME THAT EVERY BUSINESS IS

02:57:05.114 --> 02:57:07.083
DONE AT TO THE CONTRARY --

02:57:07.149 --> 02:57:09.185
IT WAS JUST READ AN ARTICLE AT

02:57:09.251 --> 02:57:10.519
THAT ONE OF MY ASSOCIATES GAPING

02:57:10.586 --> 02:57:12.888
A TASHA ON FEBRUARY AT NIGHT THE

02:57:12.955 --> 02:57:13.889
HARVARD BUSINESS REVIEW DID

02:57:13.956 --> 02:57:15.458
PUBLISHED A REPORT.

02:57:15.524 --> 02:57:16.559
THAT WAS DONE A STUDY THAT WAS

02:57:16.625 --> 02:57:18.060
DONE BY THE FORTUNE ONE THOUSAND

02:57:18.127 --> 02:57:20.896
COMPANIES AND 53% OF THEM SAID

02:57:20.963 --> 02:57:23.132
THAT THEY WEREN'T IN A POSITION

02:57:23.199 --> 02:57:27.303
TO VALUE DATA NOT WITHSTANDING.

02:57:27.370 --> 02:57:28.137
SPENDING YOU KNOW.

02:57:28.204 --> 02:57:28.738
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS AN

02:57:28.804 --> 02:57:29.472
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND

02:57:29.538 --> 02:57:31.907
OTHER TECHNOLOGIES BIG DATA TO

02:57:31.974 --> 02:57:33.275
TRY TO FIGURE OUT A DIGITAL.

02:57:33.342 --> 02:57:35.511
A DIGITIZED ASIAN MODEL BECAUSE

02:57:35.578 --> 02:57:37.313
THEY UNDERSTAND THAT IF WITHOUT

02:57:37.380 --> 02:57:38.981
A DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION MODEL

02:57:39.048 --> 02:57:40.316
THEY'RE GOING TO BE LEFT BEHIND%

02:57:40.383 --> 02:57:42.551
LIKE SO MANY OTHER INDUSTRIES

02:57:42.618 --> 02:57:42.818
THAT ARE.

02:57:42.885 --> 02:57:45.321
GO BYE BYE SO IN ORDER TO STILL

02:57:45.388 --> 02:57:48.190
KEEP JOBS AND AND INNOVATION

02:57:48.257 --> 02:57:49.759
DIGITIZE ASIAN IS NECESSARY.

02:57:49.825 --> 02:57:50.993
BUT HOW TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN AND

02:57:51.060 --> 02:57:54.563
HOW TO IN THAT HAS NOT BEEN

02:57:54.630 --> 02:57:55.364
DISCUSSED.

02:57:55.431 --> 02:57:56.766
SO WHAT I WOULD ENCOURAGE IS

02:57:56.832 --> 02:57:58.701
THAT WE USE THIS AND AGAIN I'M

02:57:58.768 --> 02:58:00.302
NOT GONNA GO INTO SPECIFICS AT A

02:58:00.369 --> 02:58:02.838
ABOUT ANY PARTICULAR FIXER OR

02:58:02.905 --> 02:58:04.407
ANY PARTICULAR ISSUE WHEN A LOT

02:58:04.473 --> 02:58:05.608
OF WHAT I WANNA SAY IS THERE ARE

02:58:05.674 --> 02:58:07.043
FRINGE CASES.

02:58:07.109 --> 02:58:09.912
AND THOSE WILL BE ADDRESSED AND

02:58:09.979 --> 02:58:12.181
AND ALSO THAT SO MUCH HAS BEEN

02:58:12.248 --> 02:58:14.884
DONE IN THE VACUUM OF

02:58:14.950 --> 02:58:17.520
LEGISLATION AND OUT DATA

02:58:17.586 --> 02:58:18.320
PROTECTION LAWS WHICH HAVE NOW

02:58:18.387 --> 02:58:20.489
SORT OF BEEN SHEPHERDED AND AT

02:58:20.556 --> 02:58:21.590
BECAUSE OF THE VISIBILITY I

02:58:21.657 --> 02:58:23.959
THINK THAT STARTED WITH GPR BUT

02:58:24.026 --> 02:58:24.160
WE'VE.

02:58:24.226 --> 02:58:25.294
SEEN A FLOOD OF NEW.

02:58:25.361 --> 02:58:26.896
ALLIES THAT ARE COMING IN ACROSS

02:58:26.962 --> 02:58:28.164
THE GLOBE.

02:58:28.230 --> 02:58:29.698
IT'S NOT AS IF BUSINESSES WERE

02:58:29.765 --> 02:58:31.500
EMAIL FLAGRANTLY VIOLATING

02:58:31.567 --> 02:58:32.368
SOMETHING THAT EXISTED WE'RE

STATE OF THE ART WHAT WE DON'T

02:59:22.318 --> 02:59:23.285
WANT TO HAVE HAPPEN BECAUSE WE

02:59:23.352 --> 02:59:24.987

THIS AND WE HAVE TAKEN A LOOK AT

02:59:32.461 --> 02:59:33.662
THE PUBLIC RECORD TO DATA

02:59:33.729 --> 02:59:36.365

GO INTO THIS HIGHLY LITIGIOUS

03:00:03.325 --> 03:00:04.393
STATE.

03:00:04.460 --> 03:00:06.395
BECAUSE UNLIKE EUROPE THE DOES

03:00:06.462 --> 03:00:08.130
NOT HAVE A TRADITION OF CLASS

03:00:08.197 --> 03:00:10.399
ACTIONS WE DO AND SO I'VE HEARD

03:00:10.466 --> 03:00:11.800
IN A DISCUSSION ABOUT THE

03:00:11.867 --> 03:00:13.736

03:00:18.474 --> 03:00:19.441
BUSINESS.

03:00:19.508 --> 03:00:20.876
BUT WE ALSO NEED TO BE SITTING

03:00:20.943 --> 03:00:23.045
IN THE REALITY OF OUR HIGHLY

03:00:23.112 --> 03:00:24.180
LITIGIOUS STATE AND UNDERSTAND

03:00:24.246 --> 03:00:26.282

03:00:27.249 --> 03:00:28.617
CONSUMER ADVOCATE IS GOING TO

03:00:28.684 --> 03:00:30.419

03:00:30.486 --> 03:00:34.190
EXPERIENCEAND AND ALSO CONTEXT

03:00:34.256 --> 03:00:36.125
TO NOT YOU KNOW SOUP COMPANIES

CALIFORNIA SO I JUST WANTED TO

03:00:40.963 --> 03:00:43.832
ON FRAME IT THAT WAY AND WITH

03:00:43.899 --> 03:00:44.934

03:00:45.000 --> 03:00:46.101
KIND.

03:00:46.168 --> 03:00:47.970
BUT BEFORE WE GET THERE I JUST

03:00:48.037 --> 03:00:49.572
WANT TO SAY A COUPLE COMMENTS

03:00:49.638 --> 03:00:51.040

YOU'RE SAYING --

03:00:52.708 --> 03:00:55.144
BUT THE LACK OF REGULATION IS IT

03:00:55.211 --> 03:00:57.179
CREATES A WILD WEST AND ONE OF

03:00:57.246 --> 03:00:59.315
OUR JOBS AS POLICY MAKERS IS TO

03:00:59.381 --> 03:01:00.783

LEVEL OF PRIVACY.

03:01:08.090 --> 03:01:11.660
AND TO CREATE THAT OLD

03:01:11.727 --> 03:01:13.295
BUSINESSES AND WE DON'T EVEN

03:01:13.362 --> 03:01:16.265
KNOW THE EXTENT TO WHICH

03:01:16.332 --> 03:01:17.600

03:01:25.741 --> 03:01:26.875
HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT THAT'S GOING

03:01:26.942 --> 03:01:28.377
TO BE BUT THERE ARE CERTAIN

03:01:28.444 --> 03:01:29.979
BASIC HUMAN VALUES --

03:01:30.045 --> 03:01:31.814
HUMAN NEEDS THAT WE HAVE TO

WE'RE GOING WITH TECHNOLOGY AND

03:01:35.951 --> 03:01:37.653

OF THE NEGATIVE SIDE TO THAT SO

03:03:02.538 --> 03:03:03.706
THAT WE WOULD BE ABLE TO HAVE

OTHER APPROACHES ARE LIKELY TO

03:04:08.137 --> 03:04:09.538
FALL SHORT GIVEN THE

03:04:09.605 --> 03:04:10.906
COMPLEXITIES OF THIS ECOSYSTEM

HOWEVER I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT

03:04:36.732 --> 03:04:37.499
TO DISCERN --

03:04:37.566 --> 03:04:39.001

COMPANIES WERE COLLECTING AND

03:06:09.124 --> 03:06:11.126
SURVEY THAT WE DID OF FOUR

03:06:11.193 --> 03:06:11.727
HUNDRED THOUSAND WEBSITES BY

03:06:11.793 --> 03:06:12.861
CRAWLING WEBSITES AND LOOKING

HOW THEY WERE SHARING DATA WE

03:06:14.296 --> 03:06:15.731
FOUND FOR EXAMPLE THAT.

03:06:15.797 --> 03:06:17.299
ON 88% OF THE WEBSITES WE

03:06:17.366 --> 03:06:19.134
SURVEYED --

03:06:19.201 --> 03:06:21.303
THAT GOOGLE OR SOME SORT OF

03:06:26.608 --> 03:06:29.111
ON THE TOP ONE HUNDRED WEBSITES.

03:06:29.177 --> 03:06:29.678
EIGHTY EIGHTY OF THOSE SHARE

03:06:29.745 --> 03:06:31.580

THOUSAND EIGHT FACEBOOK WASN'T

03:06:32.281 --> 03:06:33.549
AS POPULAR BUT THOSE NUMBERS ARE

03:06:33.615 --> 03:06:34.650
WORSE TODAY.

03:06:34.716 --> 03:06:36.018
IN TWENTY ELEVEN I HELPED THE

03:06:36.084 --> 03:06:38.020
WALL STREET JOURNAL A STUDY THE

03:06:38.086 --> 03:06:39.454
INFORMATION MOBILE APPS WOULD

03:06:39.521 --> 03:06:41.089
COLLECT FROM CONSUMERS AND IN A

03:06:41.156 --> 03:06:42.758
STUDY OF A HUNDRED ONE POPULAR

SMARTPHONE APPS.

03:06:43.959 --> 03:06:45.027
WE FOUND THAT MORE THAN HALF

03:06:45.093 --> 03:06:46.361
TRANSMITTED THE PHONES UNIQUE

03:06:46.428 --> 03:06:47.829

03:06:47.896 --> 03:06:49.865
IDENTIFIER TO THIRD PART PARTIES.

03:06:49.932 --> 03:06:52.501
AND NEARLY HALF A CENT FORTY

03:06:52.568 --> 03:06:54.102
SEVEN SET USES LOCATION TO

EITHER THE DEVELOPER OR THIRD

03:06:55.003 --> 03:06:56.572

03:06:56.638 --> 03:06:58.140
NECESSARY LOCATION BASED APPS

03:06:58.206 --> 03:06:59.875
THIS COULD BE A FLASHLIGHT APP

03:06:59.942 --> 03:07:00.576

IN THAT SAME SERIES THE BLAST

03:07:09.284 --> 03:07:10.919
PROBABLY ONE OF THE MOST ON I

03:07:10.986 --> 03:07:11.987
THINK I HAVE ARGUED CONCERN

03:07:12.054 --> 03:07:12.854
ARTICLES WE WORKED ON WAS

03:07:12.921 --> 03:07:13.722
LOOKING AT HOW SOME COMPANIES

03:07:14.590 --> 03:07:15.991
DIFFERENT PRICES. FOR GOODS

03:07:16.058 --> 03:07:17.526

WEBSITES THEY'D VISITED --

03:07:18.927 --> 03:07:21.296
WHERE THEIR LOCATION WE FOUND

03:07:21.363 --> 03:07:22.397
ONE RETAILER THAT FOR EXAMPLE

03:07:22.464 --> 03:07:24.232
WAS CHARGING CONSUMERS MORE FOR

03:07:24.299 --> 03:07:25.734
STAPLER --

03:07:25.801 --> 03:07:27.603

STAPLER --

03:07:29.438 --> 03:07:30.572
BASED ON HOW FAR THEY WERE FROM

03:07:30.639 --> 03:07:32.407
THE COMPETITOR SO THEY KNEW HOW

03:07:32.474 --> 03:07:33.742
DIFFICULT IT WAS AN ABOUT

03:07:33.809 --> 03:07:34.977
CONSUMERS' WILLINGNESS TO PAY

03:07:35.043 --> 03:07:37.112
AND SO THEY WOULD CHARGE MORE

03:07:37.179 --> 03:07:38.113
FOR CONSUMERS.

03:10:34.589 --> 03:10:35.791
THEIR TERMS OF SERVICE.

03:10:35.857 --> 03:10:39.928
AND SO AS A JUDICIARY COMMITTEE

03:10:39.995 --> 03:10:42.597
ATTIC SOMETIMES THE MERE

03:10:42.664 --> 03:10:44.432
COLLECTION AND RETENTION CAN

03:10:44.499 --> 03:10:46.001
CAUSE GREAT PROB PRIVACY HARM.

03:10:46.067 --> 03:10:47.536
TO LAST WEEK A LIST OF TWO POINT

03:10:47.602 --> 03:10:48.637
FOUR MILLION INDIVIDUALS AND

03:10:48.703 --> 03:10:49.971
CORPORATE ENTITIES WAS EXPOSED

03:10:50.038 --> 03:10:51.506
ON THE INTERNET THE LIST OF

03:10:51.573 --> 03:10:53.008
CURRENT AND FORMER POLITICIANS

03:10:53.074 --> 03:10:54.342
INDIVIDUALS.

03:10:54.409 --> 03:10:55.977
OR COMPANIES UNDER SANCTIONS

03:10:56.044 --> 03:10:57.846
SINCE OR CONVICTED OF HIGH

03:10:57.913 --> 03:10:59.281
PROFILE FINANCIAL CRIMES.

03:10:59.347 --> 03:11:00.649
LINKS TO TERRORISM OR DEEM

03:11:00.715 --> 03:11:02.517
SPECIAL INTERESTS PERSONS WAS

03:11:02.584 --> 03:11:04.619
COMPILED BY DOW JONES FROM.

03:11:04.686 --> 03:11:06.621
PRIVATE AND PUBLIC SOURCES AND

03:11:06.688 --> 03:11:09.191
THEN MADE FOR SALE AND SADLY

03:11:09.257 --> 03:11:09.825
THAT INFORMATION WAS NOT SECURED

03:11:09.891 --> 03:11:10.759
SO.

03:11:10.826 --> 03:11:11.860
RESEARCHERS WERE ABLE TO PULL

03:11:11.927 --> 03:11:13.061
AND DISCOVERS INFORMATION

03:11:13.128 --> 03:11:14.529
PUBLICLY ON THE INTERNET AND

03:11:14.596 --> 03:11:16.665
THIS FOLLOWS JUST TWO YEARS AGO

03:11:16.731 --> 03:11:18.567
WHEN THE DOW JONES HAD A SIMILAR

03:11:18.633 --> 03:11:19.968
BREACH OF PERSONALS --

03:11:20.035 --> 03:11:20.702
PERSONAL INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR

03:11:20.769 --> 03:11:22.704
CONSUMERS BY THE SAME MECHANISM

03:11:22.771 --> 03:11:24.472
THEY ON SECURED A CLOUD STORAGE

03:11:24.539 --> 03:11:26.675
PROVIDER --

03:11:26.741 --> 03:11:27.909
SO IF IT TELLS A DEFINITIVE

03:11:27.976 --> 03:11:28.977
HISTORY SAUCE ANYTHING IT'S OF

03:11:29.044 --> 03:11:30.078
THE STATE OF ONLINE PRIVACY HAS

03:11:30.145 --> 03:11:33.682
GOTTEN WORSE NOT BETTER IN THE

03:11:33.748 --> 03:11:34.649
LAST DECADE.

03:11:34.716 --> 03:11:36.818
SO TO SWITCH TO SEE CPAC YOU'VE

03:11:36.885 --> 03:11:37.786
HEARD A GREAT DEAL ABOUT THE CPA

03:11:37.853 --> 03:11:38.687
TO AND HOW IT.

03:11:38.753 --> 03:11:39.754
OPERATES I KINDA WANT TO

03:11:39.821 --> 03:11:40.288
HIGHLIGHT THE FUNDAMENTAL

03:11:40.355 --> 03:11:40.722
BENEFITS OF THAT THE

03:11:40.789 --> 03:11:41.656
ARCHITECTURE PROVIDES

03:11:41.723 --> 03:11:43.992
SPECIFICALLY IT ALLOWS CONSUMERS

03:11:44.059 --> 03:11:44.726
TO OPT OUT OF THE SALE OF

03:11:44.793 --> 03:11:46.595
INFORMATION. FOR VALUABLE

03:11:46.661 --> 03:11:48.129
CONSIDERATION --

03:11:48.196 --> 03:11:49.664
SAILOR SHARING OF INFORMATION

03:11:49.731 --> 03:11:51.099
FOR A FOR VITAL CONSIDERATION --

03:11:51.166 --> 03:11:52.567
TO THIRD PARTIES THAT THEY DON'T

03:11:52.634 --> 03:11:54.202
HAVE A DIRECT RELATIONSHIP WITH

03:11:54.269 --> 03:11:56.238
RIGHT SO --

03:11:56.304 --> 03:11:57.539
ALL OF THE EXAMPLES I LAID OUT

03:11:57.606 --> 03:11:59.140
BE CREATED A COLLECTION OF

03:11:59.207 --> 03:12:01.142
INFORMATION WAS MADE POSSIBLE BY

03:12:01.209 --> 03:12:02.544
THE THE SUPPLEMENTAL SAILOR

03:12:02.611 --> 03:12:04.112
SHARING INFORMATIONS TO THIRD

03:12:04.179 --> 03:12:05.881
PARTIES RIGHT SO NOT THE FIRST

03:12:05.947 --> 03:12:06.915
PART IS NOT THE BUSINESS OF THE

03:12:06.982 --> 03:12:08.183
CONSUMERS KNOW AND TRUST.

03:12:08.250 --> 03:12:10.919
BUT THE THIRD PARTIES THAT THEY

03:12:10.986 --> 03:12:13.788
DON'T HAVE ANY RELATIONS.

03:12:13.855 --> 03:12:14.756
COMPANIES WILL BE PROHIBITED

03:12:14.823 --> 03:12:16.091
FROM SELLING OR SHARING AND

03:12:16.157 --> 03:12:17.893
CONSUMERS INFORMATION --

03:12:17.959 --> 03:12:18.860
DATA BROKERS ATTRACT USERS OF

03:12:18.927 --> 03:12:21.196
THAT CONSENT WILL BE PROHIBITED

03:12:21.263 --> 03:12:21.730
FROM THIRD FURTHER SELLING

03:12:21.796 --> 03:12:22.831
INFORMATION --

03:12:22.898 --> 03:12:23.732
AND BE REQUIRED TO DELETE

03:12:23.798 --> 03:12:25.233
INFORMATION BASED ON A

03:12:25.300 --> 03:12:26.601
VERIFIABLE CONSUMER REQUEST.

03:12:26.668 --> 03:12:28.136
SO WHY THIS IS IMPORTANT AS THE

03:12:28.203 --> 03:12:29.638
CURRENT PRIVACY FRAMEWORK THAT

03:12:29.704 --> 03:12:30.772
WE HAVE AS I SAID DOESN'T

03:12:30.839 --> 03:12:32.874
RESTRICT ANY THIRD PARTY SHARON.

03:12:32.941 --> 03:12:34.743
AND THE FTC HAS MADE EVIDENT BY

03:12:34.809 --> 03:12:36.177
THE TWENTY FOURTEEN DATA BROKE

03:12:36.244 --> 03:12:37.612
RECORD AND THEIR STORY HAS

03:12:37.679 --> 03:12:40.448
REALLY LIMITED JURISDICTION ON

03:12:40.515 --> 03:12:42.784
ON COMPANIES THAT THE COMPANY

03:12:42.851 --> 03:12:44.319
DOESN'T HAVE A RELATIONSHIP WITH

03:12:44.386 --> 03:12:44.986
RIGHT TO THE QUESTION.

03:12:45.053 --> 03:12:46.154
THAT TO SEIZE PRIMARY AUTHORITY

03:12:46.221 --> 03:12:47.389
FUNCTIONS UNDER SECTION FIVE

03:12:47.455 --> 03:12:48.823
WHICH IS UNFAIR AND DECEPTIVE

03:12:48.890 --> 03:12:49.524
TRADE PRACTICES.

03:12:49.591 --> 03:12:50.792
PRIMARILY PRIVACY CASES FALL

03:12:50.859 --> 03:12:52.327
UNDER DECEPTION WHICH IS WHAT

03:12:52.394 --> 03:12:54.029
CONSUMERS EXPECT A WHAT COMPANY

03:12:54.095 --> 03:12:55.830
SAID CONSUMERS CONSUMERS NEVER

03:12:55.897 --> 03:12:56.998
SEE.

03:12:57.065 --> 03:12:58.833
THIRD PARTIES PRIVACY POLICIES

03:12:58.900 --> 03:13:00.568
AND IN SOME CASES THE FTC

03:13:00.635 --> 03:13:02.070
DOESN'T CONSIDER OR HAS

03:13:02.137 --> 03:13:03.571
INDICATED THAT THOSE ARE LESS

03:13:03.638 --> 03:13:05.774
MATERIAL THAN THE ONES THAT

03:13:05.840 --> 03:13:06.808
CONSUMERS OF A FIRST PARTY.

03:13:06.875 --> 03:13:07.776
QUESTION SHIP WITH SO AS A

03:13:07.842 --> 03:13:10.245
RESULT CPA WILL PREVENT THAT

03:13:10.312 --> 03:13:11.346
THIRD PARTY.

03:13:11.413 --> 03:13:12.847
KIND OF COLLECTION AND FOCUS THE

03:13:12.914 --> 03:13:14.716
INTERACTION BETWEEN THE USER AND

03:13:14.783 --> 03:13:15.951
WITH COMPANIES A CONSUMERS HAVE

03:13:16.017 --> 03:13:17.385
A RELATIONSHIP WITH THEIR BY

03:13:17.452 --> 03:13:19.454
STRENGTHENING I THINK THE FTC'S

03:13:19.521 --> 03:13:24.159
ABILITY TO ENFORCE THOSE CASES --

03:13:24.225 --> 03:13:24.526
FOR THE MORE --

03:13:24.592 --> 03:13:28.063
THE THE STREAM OF DESPITE WHAT

03:13:28.129 --> 03:13:29.264
YOU HEAR --

03:13:29.331 --> 03:13:31.032
MUCH OVER THAT AS MR TIGER

03:13:31.099 --> 03:13:31.900
POINTED OUT MUCH OF THE

03:13:31.967 --> 03:13:33.068
PROVISIONS AROUND OPT OUT AND

03:13:33.134 --> 03:13:34.235
SELL PERSONAL INFORMATION PULL

03:13:34.302 --> 03:13:35.370
FROM DO NOT TRACK AND OTHER

TECHNOLOGIST INDUSTRY ACTUALLY

03:13:41.576 --> 03:13:42.677
DID THE W. THREE C. WAS

03:13:42.744 --> 03:13:44.479
EVENTUALLY OVER RUN BY INDUSTRY

03:13:44.546 --> 03:13:45.413
IF YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THE

HISTORY OF THAT PROJECT --

03:13:47.649 --> 03:13:49.451
IT ALSO FOLLOWS INTERESTING

03:13:49.517 --> 03:13:51.486
INDUSTRY PRACTICES FOR EXAMPLE --

03:13:51.553 --> 03:13:53.088
IF YOU RUN A WEBSITE YOU CAN USE

03:13:53.154 --> 03:13:55.023

PURPOSES.

03:14:28.790 --> 03:14:29.891
THE ONE I'M CRITICAL

03:14:29.958 --> 03:14:30.925
CLARIFICATION INDEED ONE OF THE

03:14:30.992 --> 03:14:31.760
MOST IMPORTANT.

03:14:31.826 --> 03:14:32.360
THINGS YOU HAVE AT IT IS THAT

03:14:32.427 --> 03:14:33.561
THE DEVIL IS IN THE DETAILS AND

03:14:33.628 --> 03:14:34.429
ONE OF THE DEVIL'S THE CRITICAL

03:14:34.496 --> 03:14:36.131
DEVILS IS AROUND THIS ISSUE OF

03:14:36.197 --> 03:14:37.699
PSEUDO IDENTIFIERS.

03:14:37.766 --> 03:14:39.734
RIGHT SO NEARLY ALL OF THE CASES

03:14:39.801 --> 03:14:40.568
I DESCRIBED WITH THE EXCEPTION

03:14:40.635 --> 03:14:43.238
OF THE DOW JONES DATA BREACH

03:14:43.304 --> 03:14:45.040
RELY ON PSEUDO AN IDENTIFIER

03:14:45.106 --> 03:14:46.608
SAID A SUIT IDENTIFIERS SIMPLY

03:14:46.674 --> 03:14:47.976
JUST A RANDOM NUMBER THAT I CAN

03:14:48.043 --> 03:14:49.010
ASSIGN.

03:14:49.077 --> 03:14:49.544
TO THAT YOU'RE PERMITTED

03:14:49.611 --> 03:14:51.446
IDENTIFIER FOR EXAMPLE YOUR

03:14:51.513 --> 03:14:52.614
MOBILE DEVICES ALL OF YOUR

03:14:52.680 --> 03:14:53.748
MOBILE DEVICES TODAY HAVE A

03:14:53.815 --> 03:14:55.850
HARDWARE IDENTIFIER THAT IS

03:14:55.917 --> 03:14:57.285
PERSISTENT TO THE DEVICE FOR THE

03:14:57.352 --> 03:14:58.553
LIFE OF THE DEVICE THAT NEVER

03:14:58.620 --> 03:15:00.021
CHANGES AND THIS IS IN FACT HOW.

03:15:00.088 --> 03:15:01.489
RETAILERS WILL TRACK YOU AS YOU

03:15:01.556 --> 03:15:03.258
WALK AROUND THE STREETS RIGHT

03:15:03.324 --> 03:15:05.160
SOMETIMES THAT RANDOMLY ASSIGNED

03:15:05.226 --> 03:15:06.728
MORE OFTEN THERE ARE YOU THERE

03:15:06.795 --> 03:15:11.766
ESSENTIALLY HASHES OF YOUR YOUR

03:15:11.833 --> 03:15:14.569
YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS OR YOUR JUST

03:15:14.636 --> 03:15:15.370
A WAY TO SCRAMBLE.

03:15:15.437 --> 03:15:17.072
SOMEONE'S EMAIL ADDRESS SO THAT

03:15:17.138 --> 03:15:19.140
IT'S NOT READABLE BUT THE WAY I

03:15:19.207 --> 03:15:20.642
SCRAMBLED IS CONSISTENT SUCH

03:15:20.708 --> 03:15:22.677
THAT IF YOU AND I BOTH HAVE THE

03:15:22.744 --> 03:15:24.412
SAME AMOUNT WILL ADDRESS WE KNOW

03:15:24.479 --> 03:15:25.980
WHAT OUR FIRST THE SAME PERSON

03:15:26.047 --> 03:15:27.715
BUT WE CAN TALK AND COAT.

03:15:27.782 --> 03:15:29.417
RIGHT AND SO --

03:15:29.484 --> 03:15:30.351
IT IT'S IT'S A IT'S SLIGHTLY

03:15:30.418 --> 03:15:32.153
COMPLICATED BUT IT WOULD SIMPLY

03:15:32.220 --> 03:15:34.656
BE LIKE TAKING YOUR NAME HANNAH

03:15:34.722 --> 03:15:36.291
AND CHANGED BY LAW ONE LETTER --

03:15:36.357 --> 03:15:38.259
BASICALLY ADDING ONE CHARACTER

03:15:38.326 --> 03:15:41.496
TO TO THE LETTER IN ORDER --

03:15:41.563 --> 03:15:42.097
TO TO WOULD DEVELOP A UNIQUE

03:15:42.163 --> 03:15:43.431
IDENTIFIER AND WHY THAT MATTERS

03:15:43.498 --> 03:15:44.566
IS LIKE CURRENTLY THERE'S A

03:15:44.632 --> 03:15:46.000
PRACTICE IS A COMPANY CALLED

03:15:46.067 --> 03:15:48.269
DATA LOGICS FOR EXAMPLE THAT

03:15:48.336 --> 03:15:49.971
FACEBOOK EMPLOYEES WHERE BY --

03:15:50.038 --> 03:15:52.407
WHEN YOU WALK INTO A CVS AND

03:15:52.474 --> 03:15:53.408
PURCHASE?

03:15:53.475 --> 03:15:54.809
AN ITEM LIKE A RAZOR BLADE

03:15:54.876 --> 03:15:57.145
THROUGH A LOYALTY PROGRAM --

03:15:57.212 --> 03:15:59.714
IF YOU WITH THEIR LOYALTY CARD --

03:15:59.781 --> 03:16:01.216
CVS IS ABLE TO SEND THEIR AND

03:16:01.282 --> 03:16:02.584
THAT PURCHASE HISTORY TO DATA

03:16:02.650 --> 03:16:04.686
LOGICS AND FACEBOOK ALSO SENDS

03:16:04.752 --> 03:16:06.955
THAT THE FACT THAT YOU'VE SEEN

03:16:07.021 --> 03:16:08.690
ADVERTISEMENT ABOUT SAY RAZOR

03:16:08.756 --> 03:16:10.725
BLADE TO THAT COMPANY.

03:16:10.792 --> 03:16:15.897

03:16:15.964 --> 03:16:17.432
WITHOUT KNOWING YOUR NAME.

03:16:17.499 --> 03:16:18.166
BE ABLE TO TELL WHO.

03:16:18.233 --> 03:16:18.933
SAW THE AD FOR RAZORS AND THEN

03:16:19.000 --> 03:16:20.001
PURCHASED IN STORE THAT RAZOR

03:16:20.068 --> 03:16:21.169
BLADE AND THEY DO THIS ALL USING

03:16:21.236 --> 03:16:22.070
PSEUDO IDENTIFIERS SUCH A HASH

03:16:22.137 --> 03:16:22.804
IDENTIFIERS.

03:16:22.871 --> 03:16:25.106
IF YOU IF I CAN'T STRESS THIS

03:16:25.173 --> 03:16:27.308
ENOUGH IF --

03:16:27.375 --> 03:16:28.676
UNLESS YOU ROAD AND FIRES ARE

03:16:28.743 --> 03:16:30.311
CONSIDERED PERSONAL INFORMATION

03:16:30.378 --> 03:16:31.946
NONE OF THE EXAMPLES I MENTION

03:16:32.013 --> 03:16:32.881
ABOVE WILL BE ADDRESSED BY THE

03:16:32.947 --> 03:16:34.349
LAW LIKE ESSENTIALLY WOULD

03:16:34.415 --> 03:16:37.218
COMPLETELY GOT CCPA A FEW EXAMS

03:16:37.285 --> 03:16:39.120
SEROTA FIRES OR OR CLASSIFY THEM

03:16:39.187 --> 03:16:40.722
AS YOU WOULD DE IDENTIFIED DATA

03:16:40.788 --> 03:16:42.624
OR AGGREGATE DATA WHICH IS VERY

03:16:42.690 --> 03:16:44.125
DIFFERENT --

03:16:44.192 --> 03:16:45.393
ADDITIONALLY THERE WERE SOME

03:16:45.460 --> 03:16:47.228
CRITICISMS AROUND THE VAGUENESS --

03:16:47.295 --> 03:16:49.130
FOR EXAMPLE AROUND VERIFIABLE

03:16:49.197 --> 03:16:50.798

INFORMATION THIS WAS BY DESIGN

03:16:53.568 --> 03:16:55.503
RIGHT TECHNOLOGY SPECIFIC POLICY

03:16:55.570 --> 03:16:57.238
IS INCREDIBLY PLOT PROBLEMATIC

03:16:57.305 --> 03:16:58.373
AND IS USUALLY.

03:16:58.439 --> 03:17:01.209
OUTDATED BY THE TIME THE INK

03:17:01.276 --> 03:17:04.546
DRIES TO LEAVE ROOM TO THE FOR

03:17:04.612 --> 03:17:06.281
THE AG. TO PROVIDE SPECIFIC

03:17:06.347 --> 03:17:08.183
GUIDANCE FOR EXAMPLE AROUND WHAT

03:17:08.249 --> 03:17:09.584
CONSTITUTES AS CAN A VERIFIABLE

03:17:09.651 --> 03:17:11.653
CONSUMER REQUEST FOR THE RIGHT

03:17:11.719 --> 03:17:13.621
TO ACCESS OR DELETE.

03:17:13.688 --> 03:17:15.290
IT ALLOWS THE AG TO PROMULGATE

03:17:15.356 --> 03:17:16.424
RULES.

03:17:16.491 --> 03:17:17.592
THAT ESSENTIALLY --

03:17:17.659 --> 03:17:20.995
GUIDE HOW USERS CAN REQUEST TO

03:17:21.062 --> 03:17:21.796
DELETE INFORMATION AND SECURE

03:17:21.863 --> 03:17:23.331
MANNER WHILE STILL ALLOWING THE

03:17:23.398 --> 03:17:25.066
OPT OUT STANDARD TO BE LOWER AND

03:17:25.133 --> 03:17:26.534
ALLOW CONSUMERS TO OPT OUT OF

FOR EXAMPLE PSEUDONYMOUS

03:17:27.502 --> 03:17:28.269
TRACKING.

03:17:28.336 --> 03:17:29.737
RIGHT IT WAS DESIGNED TO BE

03:17:29.804 --> 03:17:30.939
FLEXIBLE IN THE WAY.

03:17:31.005 --> 03:17:32.307
ADDITIONALLY THE DEFINITIONS --

03:17:32.373 --> 03:17:33.841
THE FLEXIBILITY ON PERSONAL

03:17:33.908 --> 03:17:35.677
INFORMATION WILL ALLOW THE AG TO

03:17:35.743 --> 03:17:37.512
ADD OR CHANGE DEFINITIONS OF

03:17:37.579 --> 03:17:39.013
PERSONAL INFORMATION AS

03:17:39.080 --> 03:17:39.814
TECHNOLOGY CHANGES RIGHT THE

03:17:39.881 --> 03:17:41.749
NEXT THE NEXT PLATFORM ISN'T

03:17:41.816 --> 03:17:42.951
GOING TO BE A MOBILE PHONE IT'S

03:17:43.017 --> 03:17:44.319
GOING TO BE IN A OUR OUR VIRTUAL

03:17:44.385 --> 03:17:45.787
REALITY DEVICE THAT WE WEAR.

03:17:45.853 --> 03:17:47.555
OR SOME SORT OF BODY ITEM W.

03:17:47.622 --> 03:17:48.289
WHERE THAT WON'T HAVE AN

03:17:48.356 --> 03:17:49.991
INTERFACE OR WON'T HAVE THE SAME

03:17:50.058 --> 03:17:52.560
TYPE OF DEFINITIONS FOR WHAT WE

03:17:52.627 --> 03:17:53.528
CONSIDER PERSONAL AND FOR

03:17:53.595 --> 03:17:54.596
SENSITIVE INFORMATION AND THAT

03:17:54.662 --> 03:18:00.134
FLEXIBILITY IS IMPORTANT TO ADD --

03:18:00.201 --> 03:18:01.202
FINALLY -- I

03:18:01.269 --> 03:18:02.003
THINK THIS MIGHT BE A BETTER

03:18:02.070 --> 03:18:03.037
POINT FOR MR TARGETS ATTORNEY

03:18:03.104 --> 03:18:05.907
BUT MY SUCCESS THAT THE EMPLOYEE

03:18:05.974 --> 03:18:08.610
EMPLOYER RELATIONSHIP IS COVERED.

03:18:08.676 --> 03:18:11.613
RIGHT AND THE PROVISION I THINK

03:18:11.679 --> 03:18:13.514
IT'S ONE OF FIVE D. EIGHT SAYS

03:18:13.581 --> 03:18:14.048
THAT THERE'S NO RIGHT OF

03:18:14.115 --> 03:18:15.683
DELETION IF A BUSINESS NEEDS TO

03:18:15.750 --> 03:18:17.885
COMPLY WITH AN LEGAL OBLIGATION.

03:18:17.952 --> 03:18:19.254
AND I THINK THERE'S A QUITE A

03:18:19.320 --> 03:18:21.456
NUMBER OF CALIFORNIA LAWS THAT

03:18:21.522 --> 03:18:23.157
BUSINESSES TO KEEP INFORMATION

03:18:23.224 --> 03:18:24.525
ABOUT EMPLOYEES.

03:18:24.592 --> 03:18:26.294
RIGHT SO I DON'T BELIEVE THAT

03:18:26.361 --> 03:18:26.861
THE CITY PAY WOULD SUPERSEDE

03:18:26.928 --> 03:18:29.497
THOSE --

03:18:29.564 --> 03:18:30.665
IMAGES RUSHED THROUGH FINALLY I

03:18:30.732 --> 03:18:32.700
WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE IMPACT

03:18:32.767 --> 03:18:35.069
BUSINESS RIGHT SO ONE QUICK ONE

03:18:35.136 --> 03:18:37.538
IMPORTANT POINT TO THINK ABOUT

03:18:37.605 --> 03:18:39.641
HIS -- WHAT

03:18:39.707 --> 03:18:40.275
I HAVE --

03:18:40.341 --> 03:18:41.476
WHAT THE NEW YORK TIMES DID IN

03:18:41.542 --> 03:18:44.245
RESPONSE THE GPR IN EUROPE SO --

03:18:44.312 --> 03:18:45.580
IN EUROPE.

03:18:45.647 --> 03:18:47.248
AS A RESULT OF SOME --

03:18:47.315 --> 03:18:48.983
SOME OBLIGATIONS GPR NEW YORK

03:18:49.050 --> 03:18:51.019
TIMES DECIDED TO FOREGO THIRD

03:18:51.085 --> 03:18:52.687
PARTY AD NETWORKS.

03:18:52.754 --> 03:18:54.722
AND DO PRIMARILY SELF SO IF AND

03:18:54.789 --> 03:18:57.058
SELF TARGETED ADS ON THEIR OWN

03:18:57.125 --> 03:18:58.459
PLATFORM AND WAS QUICK AND

03:18:58.526 --> 03:18:59.560
REALLY INTERESTING ABOUT THIS

03:18:59.627 --> 03:19:01.529
CHANGE WAS THAT IN IN THE TIME

03:19:01.596 --> 03:19:02.797
THEY'VE DONE THE STATE FOUND

03:19:02.864 --> 03:19:04.332
THAT THEY'VE ACTUALLY HAD NO.

03:19:04.399 --> 03:19:06.034
REDUCTION IN THEIR BOTTOM LINE

03:19:06.100 --> 03:19:07.769
RIGHT THEY'RE ABLE TO ACTUALLY --

03:19:07.835 --> 03:19:09.671
PERFORM JUST AS WELL ITH AND

03:19:09.737 --> 03:19:11.372
THERE'S A DID YOU DAY ARTICLE --

03:19:11.439 --> 03:19:12.607
IF YOU GUYS WHENEVER I'M HAPPY

03:19:12.674 --> 03:19:13.808

HAPPY TO SEND ANY OF THE

03:19:15.343 --> 03:19:19.580
REFERENCES IF THEY'RE HELPFUL --

03:19:19.647 --> 03:19:20.581
THE OTHER POINT THAT'S IMPORTANT

03:19:20.648 --> 03:19:22.250
IS THAT.

03:19:22.317 --> 03:19:23.918
MOST SMALL BUSINESSES TODAY MORE

03:19:23.985 --> 03:19:26.054
AND MORE RELY ON CLOUD SERVICES

03:19:26.120 --> 03:19:28.156
SUCH AS GOOGLE AMAZON SALES

03:19:28.222 --> 03:19:29.590
FORCE AT CETERA.

03:19:29.657 --> 03:19:32.493
AND INCLUDING SCHOOLS NOW MOVING

03:19:32.560 --> 03:19:34.796
TO CLOUD INTO G. SWEET PRODUCTS.

03:19:34.862 --> 03:19:36.531
JUST LIKE SECURITY MY BELIEF IS

03:19:36.597 --> 03:19:37.999
THAT PRIVACY IS GONNA BE

03:19:38.066 --> 03:19:40.168
COMMODITIZED AND THAT MUCH OF

03:19:40.234 --> 03:19:42.236
THE FEATURES LIKE I DESCRIBED IN

03:19:42.303 --> 03:19:43.938
THAT GOOGLE ANALYTICS EXAMPLE.

03:19:44.005 --> 03:19:45.606
WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR SMALL

03:19:45.673 --> 03:19:48.443
BUSINESSES TO TURN ON LAWS

03:19:48.509 --> 03:19:49.377
SIMILARLY FOR THE RIGHT OF

03:19:49.444 --> 03:19:50.778
ACCESS WHICH MOST OF THE CLOUD

03:19:50.845 --> 03:19:52.780
PLATFORMS PROVIDE OR FOR THE

03:19:52.847 --> 03:19:55.249
RIGHT OF DELETION --

03:19:55.316 --> 03:19:56.317
FINALLY TO STEAL MISTER

03:19:56.384 --> 03:19:58.686
TAGGART'S MAC METAPHOR ABOUT THE

03:19:58.753 --> 03:20:00.888
AUTO INDUSTRY --

03:20:00.955 --> 03:20:01.556
I THINK YOU SEE WILL APPEAR WILL

03:20:01.622 --> 03:20:03.157
PROMOTE MAR SUSTAINABLE

03:20:03.224 --> 03:20:05.059
PRACTICES AROUND USER DATA.

03:20:05.126 --> 03:20:05.827
RIGHT --

03:20:05.893 --> 03:20:06.928
ULTIMATELY I THINK THIS IS GOING

03:20:06.994 --> 03:20:08.496
TO BE TO THE BENEFIT OF BOTH

03:20:08.563 --> 03:20:10.365
CONSUMERS AND TO INDUSTRY.

03:20:10.431 --> 03:20:12.633
RIGHT SELECT THE INNOVATION IN

03:20:12.700 --> 03:20:14.202
AUTOMOBILE EMISSIONS THAT

03:20:14.268 --> 03:20:15.970
CALIFORNIA WAS LEADING ON I

03:20:16.037 --> 03:20:17.905
THINK THE CPA WILL ESSENTIALLY

03:20:17.972 --> 03:20:19.841
PROMOTE MORE PRIVACY PRESERVING

03:20:19.907 --> 03:20:21.008
PRACTICES WHICH YOU'RE ALREADY

03:20:21.075 --> 03:20:25.380
SEEING COMPANIES LIKE APPLE --

03:20:25.446 --> 03:20:27.448
DUCKDUCKGO THE NEW YORK TIMES

03:20:27.515 --> 03:20:28.916
EVEN A BROWSER MAKER LIKE BRAVE

03:20:28.983 --> 03:20:30.251
THAT'S LEARNED HOW TO DO

03:20:30.318 --> 03:20:32.186
ADVERTISE TARGETED ADVERTISING

03:20:32.253 --> 03:20:33.788
WITHOUT REVEALING CONSUMERS DATA.

03:20:33.855 --> 03:20:35.189
THOSE PRACTICES ARE AN EMERGENCE

03:20:35.256 --> 03:20:37.091
IN THE SAME WAY THAT THAT --%

03:20:37.158 --> 03:20:38.292
ENVIRONMENTALLY EFFICIENT

03:20:38.359 --> 03:20:40.361
AUTOMOBILES HAVE BECOME KIND OF

03:20:40.428 --> 03:20:41.262
LEADING THE WAY AND ASKS BIG

03:20:41.329 --> 03:20:42.530
SOURCE OF INNOVATION AND A BIG

03:20:42.597 --> 03:20:46.501
SOURCE OF COMMERCE AT THE

03:20:46.567 --> 03:20:47.101
CALIFORNIA WILL DEFINITELY THE

03:20:47.168 --> 03:20:48.436
WAY --

03:20:48.503 --> 03:20:50.738
FINALLY I WANT TO TOUCH ON THE

03:20:50.805 --> 03:20:52.039
OTHER EFFORTS TO WHY SAID WHY

03:20:52.106 --> 03:20:53.274
THINKS YOU CPA IS CRITICALLY

03:20:53.341 --> 03:20:55.843
IMPORTANT AS AN APPROACH --

03:20:55.910 --> 03:20:57.645
WHY EVEN DEADLY HEARD ABOUT A

03:20:57.712 --> 03:20:58.679
NUMBER OF EFFORTS FOR OMNIBUS

03:20:58.746 --> 03:21:00.381
PROBABLY PRIVACY?

03:21:00.448 --> 03:21:01.649
REGULATION AND THEY OFTEN

03:21:01.716 --> 03:21:03.050
INCLUDE FACIAL RECOGNITION

03:21:03.117 --> 03:21:05.420
LOCATION DISCRIMINATION A I'D

03:21:05.486 --> 03:21:07.321
BUY S. --

03:21:07.388 --> 03:21:08.923
BISON ALGORITHMS AT CETERA.

03:21:08.990 --> 03:21:10.491
AND THE ISSUE IS THAT THESE

03:21:10.558 --> 03:21:11.592
MYRIAD OF ACT --

03:21:11.659 --> 03:21:13.361
ISSUES THAT INVOLVE BOTH THE

03:21:13.428 --> 03:21:15.563
FIRST PARTY AND THE THIRD PARTY

03:21:15.630 --> 03:21:17.899
WILL ULTIMATELY LEAD TO A POLICY

03:21:17.965 --> 03:21:19.500
FRAMEWORK THIS BASED ON ENHANCE

03:21:19.567 --> 03:21:21.235
NOTICE AND CHOICE RIGHT IT WILL

03:21:21.302 --> 03:21:22.437
ULTIMATELY PUT THE BURDEN

03:21:22.503 --> 03:21:23.538
BECAUSE THE ISSUES ARE SO

03:21:23.604 --> 03:21:24.972
COMPLEX AND IT'S NOT A CLEAR CUT

03:21:25.039 --> 03:21:26.574
DIVISION BETWEEN FIRST PARTY AND

03:21:26.641 --> 03:21:27.508
THIRD PARTY.

03:21:27.575 --> 03:21:29.644
IT WILL PUT DATE THE ONUS ON THE

03:21:29.710 --> 03:21:31.379
USER TO DISCERN DISCERN WHETHER

03:21:31.446 --> 03:21:32.346
THE COLLECTION OF THEIR

03:21:32.413 --> 03:21:33.648
INFORMATION IS APPROPRIATE FOR

03:21:33.714 --> 03:21:34.949
THE TASK THAT THE BUSINESS IS

03:21:35.016 --> 03:21:36.451
GOING TO PROVIDE THEM AND THE

03:21:36.517 --> 03:21:38.019
CONSUMER HAD HAS TO STUDY.

03:21:38.085 --> 03:21:40.121
AND UNDERSTAND THE PRIVACY

03:21:40.188 --> 03:21:42.824
POLICIES AS WELL INTELLIGENCE

03:21:42.890 --> 03:21:44.158
MIGHT BE ABLE TO MAKE BASED ON

03:21:44.225 --> 03:21:44.992
THE DISCLOSURE OF THAT

03:21:45.059 --> 03:21:46.060
INFORMATION AND I THINK THAT

03:21:46.127 --> 03:21:47.662
PUTS A HUGE BURDEN ON CONSUMERS

03:21:47.728 --> 03:21:49.464
AND BECOMES UNTENABLE I DON'T

03:21:49.530 --> 03:21:51.566
THINK IT GETS ANY.

03:21:51.632 --> 03:21:53.234
ANY FURTHER TO A KIND OF A

03:21:53.301 --> 03:21:55.136
PRIVACY REGIME RIGHT IT WILL

03:21:55.203 --> 03:21:57.338
ESSENTIALLY --

03:21:57.405 --> 03:21:58.673
CONSUMERS WILL STILL WILL BE

03:21:58.739 --> 03:21:59.841
REQUIRED TO STILL READ AND

03:21:59.907 --> 03:22:01.676
UNDERSTAND PRIVACY POLICIES AND

03:22:01.742 --> 03:22:03.744
SOMETHING THAT THE INDUSTRY HAS

03:22:03.811 --> 03:22:03.945
BEEN.

03:22:04.011 --> 03:22:04.846
I AM.

03:22:04.912 --> 03:22:06.414
USING AS A WAY TO LEGITIMIZE

03:22:06.481 --> 03:22:08.082
THEIR CLUB PRACTICES ARGUING

03:22:08.149 --> 03:22:09.617
THAT -- THAT

03:22:09.684 --> 03:22:10.485
THESE PRACTICE ARE CLEARLY

03:22:10.551 --> 03:22:12.019
DEFINED AND PRIVACY POLICIES AND

03:22:12.086 --> 03:22:14.522
CONSUMERS SHOULD ESSENTIALLY --

03:22:14.589 --> 03:22:16.190
NOT USE THE PRODUCTS OR READ THE

03:22:16.257 --> 03:22:17.892
PRIVACY POLICIES TO UNDERSTAND

03:22:17.959 --> 03:22:19.260
WHAT THE PRODUCTS DO --

03:22:19.327 --> 03:22:21.596
THIS FROM A SHOW OF HANDS WHO

03:22:21.662 --> 03:22:24.532
READS PRIVACY POLICIES.

03:22:24.599 --> 03:22:26.200
HE DO FOR EVERY SAY EVEN.

03:22:26.267 --> 03:22:27.235
TO RECOVERING LAWYER I FEEL

03:22:27.301 --> 03:22:29.437
OBLIGATED TO DO THEM NOW YOU CAN

03:22:29.504 --> 03:22:30.838
ALSO ASK DO YOU UNDERSTAND THEM

03:22:30.905 --> 03:22:31.873
AND WRITE MY GET A DIFFERENT

03:22:31.939 --> 03:22:33.207
RESPONSE RATE AND AND I THINK

03:22:33.274 --> 03:22:35.943
THAT'S ANOTHER CRITICAL PIECE TO

03:22:36.010 --> 03:22:37.578
TO KIND OF TO TO THE KIND OF

03:22:37.645 --> 03:22:38.746
POINT THAT YOU HIGHLIGHTED

FRAMEWORK ESSENTIALLY ASKS TOO

03:24:02.496 --> 03:24:04.298
MUCH OF PEOPLE AND TOO LITTLE OF

THOSE ENTRUSTED WITH OUR DATA

03:24:05.766 --> 03:24:06.667

03:24:41.702 --> 03:24:42.937
THE COFFEE WE YOU DON'T KNOW

03:24:43.004 --> 03:24:44.538
WHAT ELSE IN WHAT OTHER

03:24:44.605 --> 03:24:45.873
INFORMATION WAS BEING.

03:24:45.940 --> 03:24:48.976
PROVIDED AND WHEN PEOPLE ARE

03:24:49.043 --> 03:24:50.611
EIGHTEEN OR TWENTY OR TWENTY ONE

03:24:50.678 --> 03:24:51.712
WHAT WHAT ARE THEY CARE I WANT

03:24:51.779 --> 03:24:53.080
THE JOB BUT I WONDER WHEN

03:24:53.147 --> 03:24:54.382
THEY'RE A LITTLE OLDER AND IF

03:24:54.448 --> 03:24:56.050
THEY HAVE FAMILIES TO THEY WANT

03:24:56.117 --> 03:24:58.719
THAT INFORMATION BEING OUT THERE --

03:24:58.786 --> 03:25:00.821
THAT MIGHT BE A SOURCE OF

03:25:00.888 --> 03:25:02.757
CONCERN TO THEM I MEAN I I JUST

03:25:02.823 --> 03:25:05.459
THINK THAT --

03:25:05.526 --> 03:25:08.129
IT'S THE THAT PEOPLE SHOULD

03:25:08.195 --> 03:25:09.597
CHOICES EVEN IF THEY DON'T

03:25:09.664 --> 03:25:11.565
NECESSARILY UNDERSTAND ALL

03:25:11.632 --> 03:25:13.601
ASPECTS OF IT --

03:25:13.668 --> 03:25:15.703
WE TRIED TO DO PRIVACY LAW BACK

03:25:15.770 --> 03:25:17.872
IN TWENTY YEARS AGO WITH THE

03:25:17.938 --> 03:25:19.940
CENTERS BEER I DID A LEGISLATION

03:25:20.007 --> 03:25:23.377
AND THEY WERE OPT OUT AND THE

03:25:23.444 --> 03:25:25.413
COM THEY WERE SO COMPLICATED AND

03:25:25.479 --> 03:25:27.048
THE ABILITY TO OPT OUT APPEARED

03:25:27.114 --> 03:25:29.083
ON PAGE EIGHTEEN AND IN THE

03:25:29.150 --> 03:25:30.484
SMALLEST PRINT POSSIBLE.

03:25:30.551 --> 03:25:32.386
AND I OBSERVED AT THAT POINT IF

03:25:32.453 --> 03:25:34.055
IT WAS AN OPT IN SYSTEM IT WOULD

03:25:34.121 --> 03:25:36.157
BE CLEAR AS A BELL IN THAT OFFER

03:25:36.223 --> 03:25:37.558
YOU A FREE TOASTER TO GO WITH IT --

03:25:37.625 --> 03:25:39.694
SO I THINK THAT AGAIN THERE ARE

03:25:39.760 --> 03:25:40.761
SOME OF THOSE PHILOSOPHICAL

03:25:40.828 --> 03:25:42.663
ANNONCES I'LL GIVE YOU A CHANCE

03:25:42.730 --> 03:25:43.397
TO RESPOND BECAUSE I KNOW YOU

03:25:43.464 --> 03:25:43.931
WANT.

03:25:43.998 --> 03:25:45.166
TO AND THEN I'LL INVITE ANYONE

03:25:45.232 --> 03:25:46.300
ELSE IF THEY HAVE A QUESTIONS

03:25:46.367 --> 03:25:48.002
ONE LITTLE POINT HERE YOU KNOW

03:25:48.069 --> 03:25:50.204
AND I'M REALLY GLAD TO HEAR.

03:25:50.271 --> 03:25:52.106
THAT MISTER ATTACKER AND MISTER

03:25:52.173 --> 03:25:56.844
SULTANI TALK ABOUT AND HOW THIS-BILL OVER THE SLOT IS NOT

03:25:56.911 --> 03:25:59.413
DESIGNED TO DECIMATE ON DIGITAL

03:25:59.480 --> 03:26:01.348
ADVERTISING FOR EXAMPLE.

03:26:01.415 --> 03:26:03.250
AND THAT'S AND THAT'S IMPORTANT

03:26:03.317 --> 03:26:05.619
BECAUSE YOU KNOW MANY OF THE

03:26:05.686 --> 03:26:07.621
SITES AND SERVICES ARE AVAILABLE

03:26:07.688 --> 03:26:08.889
TO CONSUMERS.

03:26:08.956 --> 03:26:11.392
AT NO CHARGE BUT THEY ARE FUNDED

03:26:11.459 --> 03:26:13.294
THROUGH ADVERTISING AND THAT'S

03:26:13.360 --> 03:26:14.428
OUR SECRET I THINK THAT'S PRETTY

03:26:14.495 --> 03:26:16.964
BIG BECOME MUCH MORE VISIBLE.

03:26:17.031 --> 03:26:18.699
AND YOU KNOW WE MIGHT BE

03:26:18.766 --> 03:26:20.267
CREATING A SYSTEM AND IT AND I

03:26:20.334 --> 03:26:21.936
WAS INTERESTED IN WHAT MR SO

03:26:22.002 --> 03:26:23.437
TINY WAS TALKING ABOUT IT IN

03:26:23.504 --> 03:26:25.406
TERMS OF NOTICING CHOICE BECAUSE

03:26:25.473 --> 03:26:26.941
UNFORTUNATELY THE CCPA.

03:26:27.007 --> 03:26:28.509
INCLUDES MORE DETAILED AN

03:26:28.576 --> 03:26:30.411
ONEROUS NOTICES THAT ARE GONNA

03:26:30.478 --> 03:26:32.513
BE LINK FEAR THAN THE ONES THAT

03:26:32.580 --> 03:26:33.814
WE HAVE WHICH SEEMS SORT OF

03:26:33.881 --> 03:26:40.654
COUNTER TO THE GOAL OF MAKING

03:26:40.721 --> 03:26:42.890
FLIPSIDE WHAT I'VE SEEN IS THAT

03:26:42.957 --> 03:26:44.391
A NUMBER OF COMPANIES ARE DOING.

03:26:44.458 --> 03:26:45.993
THEIR LEVEL BEST I JUST CAME

03:26:46.060 --> 03:26:48.496
BACK FROM RSA WHERE WE CHANGE A

03:26:48.562 --> 03:26:49.697
GROUP I WAS JUST IN FREMONT

03:26:49.764 --> 03:26:51.132
WHERE FOUR HUNDRED YOU KNOW

03:26:51.198 --> 03:26:53.234
PEOPLE WERE THERE TO BE TRAINED.

03:26:53.300 --> 03:26:55.469
EXACTLY ON HOW TO COMPLY WITH

03:26:55.536 --> 03:26:57.538
THE CPA AND YOU'VE HEARD MANY OF

03:26:57.605 --> 03:26:58.539
THE OTHER PANELISTS TALKING

03:26:58.606 --> 03:26:58.939
ABOUT.

03:26:59.006 --> 03:27:01.542
THE EFFORT AND EXPENSE COMPANIES

03:27:01.609 --> 03:27:03.410
ARE GOING TO TO TRY TO MAKE

03:27:03.477 --> 03:27:05.746
NOTICES TRANSPARENT BECAUSE NOT

03:27:05.813 --> 03:27:07.414
ONLY I SAID TO THEM.

03:27:07.481 --> 03:27:09.216
YOU KNOW THAT IT IT JUST LEAVING

03:27:09.283 --> 03:27:10.184
ASIDE THE COMPLIANCE MYSTERY

03:27:10.251 --> 03:27:11.218
WHEN HAVE THIS CONVERSATION

03:27:11.285 --> 03:27:12.620
ABOUT FRAMEWORK TO LOOK THINK

03:27:12.686 --> 03:27:13.954
LOOK AT THINGS.

03:27:14.021 --> 03:27:15.656
IT'S ALSO NOT IN THE INTEREST OF

03:27:15.723 --> 03:27:17.258
THE BRAND I THINK YOU GUYS ALL

03:27:17.324 --> 03:27:18.092
SAW.

03:27:18.159 --> 03:27:20.127
A YOU KNOW SITUATIONS WHERE OF

03:27:20.194 --> 03:27:23.097
BRAND VALUE HAS BEEN AS FINO NOT

03:27:23.164 --> 03:27:25.199
CALCULATED APPROPRIATELY AND

03:27:25.266 --> 03:27:26.767
STOCK PRICES TANK.

03:27:26.834 --> 03:27:28.202
THAT'S NOT IN ANY BUSINESSES

03:27:28.269 --> 03:27:29.570
INTERESTING SO I THINK WHAT WE

03:27:29.637 --> 03:27:32.773
NEED TO START THINKING ABOUT.

03:27:32.840 --> 03:27:34.809
IS HAVING THAT YOU KNOW --

03:27:34.875 --> 03:27:35.676
AND I APPRECIATE EVERYTHING MR

03:27:35.743 --> 03:27:39.880
SO TINY WAS SAYING THAT IT

03:27:39.947 --> 03:27:40.614
SHOULDN'T BE AN US AND THEM.

03:27:40.681 --> 03:27:41.248
WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY RIGHT NOW

03:27:41.315 --> 03:27:43.117
TO HAVE A SOPHISTICATED

03:27:43.184 --> 03:27:45.553
DISCUSSION ABOUT HOW AS A

03:27:45.619 --> 03:27:47.154
COMMUNITY.

03:27:47.221 --> 03:27:50.157
NOT JUST ON BUSINESS REGULATORS

03:27:50.224 --> 03:27:52.626
LEGISLATORS CONSUMERS AND

03:27:52.693 --> 03:27:54.895
BUSINESS WORK TOGETHER TO MOVE

03:27:54.962 --> 03:27:56.363
FORWARD IN THIS DIGITAL AGE.

03:27:56.430 --> 03:27:57.665
BECAUSE YES THERE ARE CERTAIN

03:27:57.731 --> 03:27:59.166
THINGS THAT COULD BE DONE

03:27:59.233 --> 03:28:00.801
WITHOUT DIGITAL ADVERTISING FOR

03:28:00.868 --> 03:28:02.102
EXAMPLE BUT THEN YOU HAVE WHOLE

03:28:02.169 --> 03:28:03.571
SWATHS OF COMMUNITIES THAT ARE

03:28:03.637 --> 03:28:07.875
NOT ABLE TO PAY. FOR THE IN A

03:28:07.942 --> 03:28:10.010
FIFTEEN HUNDRED DOLLAR I EXCUSE

03:28:10.077 --> 03:28:10.978

03:28:11.045 --> 03:28:13.347
ACTIONS THAT MIGHT BE OBLIGATED

03:28:13.414 --> 03:28:14.915
TO BE PASSED ON TO CONSUMERS IT

03:28:14.982 --> 03:28:16.750
AND I WE READ THESE AWAY SO CAN

03:28:16.817 --> 03:28:17.284
COURT YOU'VE DONE EDUCATED

03:28:17.351 --> 03:28:18.552
DISCUSSION ARTICULATED I THINK

03:28:18.619 --> 03:28:20.321
WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO DO HERE

03:28:20.387 --> 03:28:22.790
THIS IS NOT AN US VERSUS THEM.

03:28:22.857 --> 03:28:24.058
WE'RE TRYING TO PRIORITIZE AS I

03:28:24.124 --> 03:28:25.192
MENTIONED THE THE

03:28:25.259 --> 03:28:26.894
RESPONSIBILITIES WE HAVE TO THE

03:28:26.961 --> 03:28:28.229
PUBLIC TO THE PEOPLE THAT WE

03:28:28.295 --> 03:28:30.531
REPRESENT ABOUT A MILLION EACH

03:28:30.598 --> 03:28:31.465
BY THE WAY THAT'S A LOT OF

03:28:31.532 --> 03:28:31.999
PEOPLE.

03:28:32.066 --> 03:28:33.734
AND YOU HEARD THE NUMBERS 80%

03:28:33.801 --> 03:28:34.935
WANT US TO DO MORE ON THEIR

03:28:35.002 --> 03:28:36.904
PRIVACY ON THE OTHER HAND PEOPLE

03:28:36.971 --> 03:28:38.606
WANT THOSE ADVERTISEMENTS AND I

03:28:38.672 --> 03:28:39.974
DON'T THINK ANYONE HERE IS

03:28:40.040 --> 03:28:40.808
TRYING.

03:28:40.875 --> 03:28:42.443
TO UNDERMINE THAT WE JUST WANT

03:28:42.509 --> 03:28:47.448
TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO A CONSENT

03:28:47.514 --> 03:28:48.916
OR NOT TO CONSENT TO IT'S A

03:28:48.983 --> 03:28:50.217
RIGHT TO KNOW --

03:28:50.284 --> 03:28:51.986
THE ABILITY TO MAKE THAT CHOICE

03:28:52.052 --> 03:28:54.121
TO CONSENT OR NOT AND THEN --

03:28:54.188 --> 03:28:55.322
HOPEFULLY WILL BE ABLE TO

03:28:55.389 --> 03:28:56.857
PROCEED FORWARD SOME OF THE

03:28:56.924 --> 03:28:58.092
THINGS HE WAS SAYING MISTER

03:28:58.158 --> 03:28:59.126
SOLTANI THAT.

03:28:59.193 --> 03:29:01.161

THE RIGHT TO OPT IN.

03:30:52.206 --> 03:30:54.808
RATHER THAN REQUIRING ALL OF US

03:30:54.875 --> 03:30:56.310
TO HAVE TO INCONVENIENTLY OPT

03:30:56.377 --> 03:30:58.712
OUT OF THE EXPLOITATION OF OUR

03:30:58.779 --> 03:31:00.280

ACROSS ALL SOFTWARE.

03:31:01.949 --> 03:31:03.717
EACH SERVICE AND EVERY SITE WE

03:31:03.784 --> 03:31:06.387

EXTENSION BACKED BY LAW IS

03:31:17.097 --> 03:31:19.633
HELPFUL. FOR PROTECTIONS ON

03:31:22.069 --> 03:31:23.337
ON THE WIDELY POPULAR

03:31:23.404 --> 03:31:26.640
APPLICATIONS AND SERVICES.

03:31:26.707 --> 03:31:27.508
THIS IS ONE OF THE MANY REASONS

03:31:27.574 --> 03:31:29.276
WE NEED TO PROTECT PERSONAL

03:31:29.343 --> 03:31:32.613

03:31:35.516 --> 03:31:37.951
ACCOUNTABLE.

03:31:38.018 --> 03:31:39.987
IN COURT IF WE VIOLATE A

03:31:40.054 --> 03:31:41.688

IN THE STATE CONSTITUTION.

03:31:45.659 --> 03:31:46.994
BUT I BELIEVE OUR LAWS DO NOT

03:31:47.061 --> 03:31:48.862
YET FULLY RESPECT WHEN IT COMES

03:31:48.929 --> 03:31:51.799

FOR CALIFORNIA'S EXTRAORDINARY

03:31:54.535 --> 03:31:56.804
TECH INDUSTRY TO STOP HARVESTING

03:31:56.870 --> 03:31:58.138

THAT HAPPEN.

03:32:06.180 --> 03:32:06.713
AND I BELIEVE THE TIME IS LONG

03:32:06.780 --> 03:32:10.350
OVERDUE.

03:32:10.417 --> 03:32:11.285
NOW YOU'VE HEARD SOME OF

03:32:11.351 --> 03:32:12.386
BUSINESSES AND TECH COMMUNITY

03:32:12.453 --> 03:32:13.787
SUGGESTING CALIFORNIA'S NEW

03:32:13.854 --> 03:32:15.489
PRIVACY LAW IF NOT SUBSTANTIALLY

03:32:15.556 --> 03:32:17.024
AMENDED WHICH OF COURSE MEANS

03:32:17.091 --> 03:32:18.625
WEEKEND BEFORE IT IS ALLOWED TO

03:32:18.692 --> 03:32:20.260
GOING TO A FACT IS GOING TO

03:32:20.327 --> 03:32:22.429
CAUSE EXTRAORDINARY BUSINESS

03:32:22.496 --> 03:32:24.832
HARDSHIP AND CONFUSION.

03:32:24.898 --> 03:32:25.799
THESE ARE OF COURSE THE SAME

03:32:25.866 --> 03:32:27.734
ARGUMENTS THAT WERE MADE BY MANY

03:32:27.801 --> 03:32:29.036
OF THESE SAME COMPANIES

03:32:29.103 --> 03:32:31.071
REGARDING EUROPE'S GPR.

03:32:31.138 --> 03:32:31.705
BUT SINCE YOU THE P. R. WENT

03:32:31.772 --> 03:32:34.074
INTO EFFECT THESE COMPANIES HAVE

03:32:34.141 --> 03:32:35.742
CONTINUED TO BE JUST FINE.

03:32:35.809 --> 03:32:37.211
AND IN MOST CASES OF GROWING

03:32:37.277 --> 03:32:39.913
PROFITS.

03:32:39.980 --> 03:32:41.482
THAT IS REAL EVIDENCE.

03:32:41.548 --> 03:32:42.516
THAT CALIFORNIA'S NEW PRIVACY

03:32:42.583 --> 03:32:44.818
LAW IS NOT GOING TO DESTROY THE

03:32:44.885 --> 03:32:48.088

G. P. ARE ARE NOT GOING TO BE

03:32:55.996 --> 03:32:59.032
HARD TO IMPLEMENT.

03:32:59.099 --> 03:33:00.868
THE KEY IS WHETHER WE COMPANIES

03:33:00.934 --> 03:33:03.504

03:33:03.570 --> 03:33:05.272

IT'S CALLED PRIVACY BY DESIGN.

THIS IS AN APPROACH ALL TECH

03:36:14.528 --> 03:36:16.029
COMPANIES CAN IMPLEMENT IF THEY

03:36:16.096 --> 03:36:18.598

MENTIONED I FOUND THE COMPANY IN --

03:37:46.553 --> 03:37:47.087
TWO THOUSAND EIGHT OUR PRIMARY

03:37:47.154 --> 03:37:48.121
SERVICE IS A SEARCH ENGINE

03:37:48.188 --> 03:37:50.257
ALTERNATIVE TO GOOGLE THAT

03:37:50.323 --> 03:37:51.925
DOESN'T TRACK YOU --

03:37:51.992 --> 03:37:53.026
THAT ALLOWS YOU JUST LITERALLY

03:37:53.093 --> 03:37:55.061
TO CERTAIN HONESTLY ONTHE WEB

03:37:55.128 --> 03:37:56.496
AND SO WE DON'T EVEN HAVE THE

03:37:56.563 --> 03:37:57.898
CONCEPT OF A SEARCH HISTORY WHEN

03:37:57.964 --> 03:37:59.032
YOU COME TO US.

03:37:59.099 --> 03:38:00.567

WE ALSO OFFER PRIVACY BROWSER

03:38:04.070 --> 03:38:05.605
THAT'S AN ALTERNATIVE TO CHROME

03:38:05.672 --> 03:38:07.107
THAT BLOCKS ALL THOSE HIDDEN

03:38:07.174 --> 03:38:08.575
TRACKERS THE LAST PANEL SPOKE

03:38:08.642 --> 03:38:10.811
ABOUT AS YOU CAN BROWSE THE WEB.

03:38:10.877 --> 03:38:12.212
AND TOGETHER THEY KIND OF GIVE

03:38:12.279 --> 03:38:13.814
CONSUMERS THE PRIVACY ESSENTIALS

03:38:13.880 --> 03:38:19.286
THEY NEED AS THEY USED WEB --

03:38:19.352 --> 03:38:20.487
I'M HAPPY TO LIKE TALK ABOUT ALL

03:38:20.554 --> 03:38:22.122
THAT STUFF BUT SINCE THE LAST

03:38:22.189 --> 03:38:24.057
PANEL TALK ABOUT IT AMERICAN

03:38:24.124 --> 03:38:25.725
SKIPPER ALL THAT --

03:38:25.792 --> 03:38:26.626
WHAT I LIKE TO TELL YOU IS THAT

03:38:26.693 --> 03:38:29.463
WE'VE BEEN PROFITABLE SINCE --

03:38:29.529 --> 03:38:29.996
TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN EVEN

03:38:30.063 --> 03:38:31.465
THOUGH WE DON'T TRACK ANYBODY

03:38:31.531 --> 03:38:33.033
OUR PRIVACY POLICY IN A NUTSHELL

03:38:33.099 --> 03:38:35.335
IS WE DON'T COLLECT OR SHARE ANY

03:38:35.402 --> 03:38:36.870
PERSONAL INFORMATION AT ALL.

03:38:36.937 --> 03:38:38.371
SO THE QUESTION I ALWAYS GET

03:38:38.438 --> 03:38:39.506
NEXT IS WELL HOW DO YOU MAKE ANY

03:38:39.573 --> 03:38:41.141
MONEY -- AND

03:38:41.208 --> 03:38:42.275
YOU'LL BE SURPRISED IN OTHER WE

03:38:42.342 --> 03:38:43.543
MAKE MONEY THROUGH ADVERTISING --

03:38:43.610 --> 03:38:44.945
IT'S JUST CALL CONTEXTUAL

03:38:45.011 --> 03:38:46.546
ADVERTISING AND IT'S REALLY THE

03:38:46.613 --> 03:38:48.315
WAY GOOGLE STARTED TO WHEN YOU

03:38:48.381 --> 03:38:50.917
TYPE IN A SEARCH LIKE CAR YOU

03:38:50.984 --> 03:38:52.752
GET AN AD FOR A CAR.

03:38:52.819 --> 03:38:53.553
I DON'T NEED TO KNOW ANYTHING

03:38:53.620 --> 03:38:57.190
ABOUT YOU TO DO THAT BASED ON

03:38:57.257 --> 03:38:58.758
THE CONTEXTUAL INFORMATION THAT

03:38:58.825 --> 03:39:00.727
YOU GAVE THAT SAME CONCEPT BY

03:39:00.794 --> 03:39:02.729
THE WAY WORKS ON LIKE THE NEAR

03:39:02.796 --> 03:39:03.930
TIMES ARE PUBLISHING WEBSITE.

03:39:03.997 --> 03:39:06.500
OR A VIDEO THANK YOU TO HE JUST

03:39:06.566 --> 03:39:08.134
KIND OF PLAY AN AD THAT IS LIKE

03:39:08.201 --> 03:39:10.103
THE CONTENT OF THE VIDEO AND NOT

03:39:10.170 --> 03:39:11.972
ABOUT YOU AS AN INDIVIDUAL --

03:39:12.038 --> 03:39:13.673
SO THE FIRST POINT I REALLY LIKE

03:39:13.740 --> 03:39:14.274
TO MAKE IS THAT.

03:39:14.341 --> 03:39:16.276
CONTEXTUALIZED TIES THE AND IS

03:39:16.343 --> 03:39:17.978
IN HERE IN THE PRIVACY FRIENDLY.

03:39:18.044 --> 03:39:18.778
AND IN CONTRAST TO THE

03:39:18.845 --> 03:39:20.046
BEHAVIORAL ADVERTISING THAT'S

03:39:20.113 --> 03:39:21.481
KIND OF TAKEN OVER THE DIGITAL

03:39:21.548 --> 03:39:23.250
ADVERTISING MARKET IN THE LAST

03:39:23.316 --> 03:39:24.351
TEN YEARS --

03:39:24.417 --> 03:39:25.652
WHEN I STARTED TWO THOUSAND

03:39:25.719 --> 03:39:26.419
EIGHT AND ACTUALLY WHAT IT

03:39:26.486 --> 03:39:27.921
HADN'T TAKEN OVER THE MARKET

03:39:27.988 --> 03:39:28.989
GOOGLE IN FACT?

03:39:29.055 --> 03:39:30.290
WAS STILL MAINLY CONTEXTUAL

03:39:30.357 --> 03:39:31.591
ADVERTISING EVEN.

03:39:31.658 --> 03:39:33.093
THE ADVERTISING AND IT PUT

03:39:33.159 --> 03:39:34.694
AROUND THE WEB WAS CONTEXTUAL IN

03:39:34.761 --> 03:39:36.396
THEIR PROTOCOL AT CENTS OVER THE

03:39:36.463 --> 03:39:37.564
LAST TEN YEARS IT SHIFTED.

03:39:37.631 --> 03:39:38.965
BUT THERE IS NOTHING TO SAY THE

03:39:39.032 --> 03:39:40.967
CONTEXTUAL ADVERTISING COULD NOT

03:39:41.034 --> 03:39:41.835
BE AS PROP PHILLIP PAY REAL

03:39:41.902 --> 03:39:43.303
ADVERTISING AND I WANTED TO THE

03:39:43.370 --> 03:39:44.504
SAME POINT ASKING MAKE WHICH IS

03:39:44.571 --> 03:39:45.772
THAT THE NEW YORK TIMES REALLY

03:39:45.839 --> 03:39:46.873
JUST DID THIS TEST.

03:39:46.940 --> 03:39:49.175
AFTER GPR IN EUROPE AND THEY GOT

03:39:49.242 --> 03:39:50.176
RID OF ALL BEHAVIORAL

03:39:50.243 --> 03:39:51.177
ADVERTISING AND THEY MADE MORE

03:39:51.244 --> 03:39:53.179
MONEY -- AND

03:39:53.246 --> 03:39:54.814
SO I THINK IT IS A WORKABLE --

03:39:54.881 --> 03:39:56.216
BUSINESS MODEL --

03:39:56.283 --> 03:39:57.284
THE SECOND POINT I'D LIKE TO

03:39:57.350 --> 03:40:01.888
MAKE IS THAT CONSUMERS.

03:40:01.955 --> 03:40:03.156
ACTUALLY WANT TO USE BRANDS THAT

03:40:03.223 --> 03:40:03.657
THEY TRUST SO.

03:40:03.723 --> 03:40:06.226
WE HAVE BEEN ATTRACTING

03:40:06.293 --> 03:40:07.494
CONSUMERS --

03:40:07.561 --> 03:40:11.064
YEAR OVER YEAR I A GROWING FIFTY

03:40:11.131 --> 03:40:12.832
AND A 100% AND NOW WE DO ABOUT A

03:40:12.899 --> 03:40:14.234
BILLION SEARCHES A MONTH. FOR

03:40:14.301 --> 03:40:15.468
THE THIRD OR FOURTH LARGEST

03:40:15.535 --> 03:40:16.903
SEARCH ENGINE IN MOST COUNTRIES

03:40:16.970 --> 03:40:18.104
IN THE WORLD --

03:40:18.171 --> 03:40:19.839
ALL BASED ON OUR PRIVACY

03:40:19.906 --> 03:40:22.709
PROMISES ALL ORGANIC GROWTH --

03:40:22.776 --> 03:40:24.210
OUR MAIN CHALLENGES KIND OF

03:40:24.277 --> 03:40:25.078
GETTING THE WORD OUT BUT AS

03:40:25.145 --> 03:40:26.513
PEOPLE LEARN THERE'S A PRIVACY

03:40:26.580 --> 03:40:27.948
ALTERNATIVE.

03:40:28.014 --> 03:40:28.715
THEY'RE THEY'RE KIND OF WALKING

03:40:28.782 --> 03:40:30.850
TO THIS -- I

03:40:30.917 --> 03:40:31.451
DON'T THINK WE'RE AN ISOLATED

03:40:31.518 --> 03:40:33.019
CASE -- I

03:40:33.086 --> 03:40:34.554
THINK -- BY

03:40:34.621 --> 03:40:36.156
CONTRAST PRIVACY RESPECTING

03:40:36.222 --> 03:40:37.090
BUSINESS MODELS.

03:40:37.157 --> 03:40:39.259
ARE KEY ATTRACTORS FOR CONSUMERS

03:40:39.326 --> 03:40:41.227
AND THE ANTI PRIVACY BUSINESS

03:40:41.294 --> 03:40:43.330
MODELS ARE QUITE CLEARLY ON THE

03:40:43.396 --> 03:40:44.564
ROPES LIKE PEOPLE ARE LEAVING

03:40:44.631 --> 03:40:46.099
THE SERVICES THAT THEY PERCEIVE

03:40:46.166 --> 03:40:47.367
TO BE EXPORTING THEIR

03:40:47.434 --> 03:40:48.068
INFORMATION.

03:40:48.134 --> 03:40:51.771
I MAKE AN ANALOGY TO BUSINESSES --

03:40:51.838 --> 03:40:53.807
KIND OF GOING OUT OF THEIR WAY

03:40:53.873 --> 03:40:57.110
TO ADDRESS THE CARBON FOOTPRINT --

03:40:57.177 --> 03:40:58.278
EVEN THOUGH THEY DON'T HAVE TO

03:40:58.345 --> 03:41:00.180
AND THAT ATTRACTS CONSUMERS --

03:41:00.246 --> 03:41:02.749
I THINK IN THE SAME WAY THAT --

03:41:02.816 --> 03:41:04.517
BUSINESSES EVEN IF THEY'RE NOT

03:41:04.584 --> 03:41:06.353
SUBJECT TO THE LAW WOULD BE WELL

03:41:06.419 --> 03:41:08.221
SERVED TO BCC OKAY COMPLIANT

03:41:08.288 --> 03:41:09.889
ACROSS THE COUNTRY BECAUSE IT

03:41:09.956 --> 03:41:12.359
THE CAN CAN USE THAT AS A AS A

03:41:12.425 --> 03:41:15.629
AS A TRACTOR.

03:41:15.695 --> 03:41:16.262
FOR THE THIRD POINT I JUST LIKE

03:41:16.329 --> 03:41:18.365
TO MAKE IS.

03:41:18.431 --> 03:41:19.432
I'M REALLY IN SUPPORT OF THE

03:41:19.499 --> 03:41:21.601
CCAC CPA BROADLY INCENTIVIZING

03:41:21.668 --> 03:41:23.703
DATA MINIMIZATION SO I VIEW THAT

03:41:23.770 --> 03:41:25.071
AS ONE OF THE KEY --

03:41:25.138 --> 03:41:28.375
POINTS THAT THE LAW IS DOING --

03:41:28.441 --> 03:41:30.276
ONE APPROACH TO COMPLIANCE IS

03:41:30.343 --> 03:41:31.978
BASICALLY TO COLLECT AND SHARE

03:41:32.045 --> 03:41:33.780
LESS PERSONAL INFORMATION --

03:41:33.847 --> 03:41:36.616
AT THE EXTREME AND ZERO LIKE US --

03:41:36.683 --> 03:41:39.586
THIS IS GREAT BECAUSE COUNTRY TO

03:41:39.653 --> 03:41:41.321
POPULAR BELIEF MOST DATA

03:41:41.388 --> 03:41:42.355
COLLECTED ACTUALLY DOES NOT

03:41:42.422 --> 03:41:44.157
DRIVE BUSINESS INTERESTS IT'S

03:41:44.224 --> 03:41:46.159
OFTEN A LIABILITY --

03:41:46.226 --> 03:41:47.560
WHEN DATA BREACHES HAPPEN THESE

03:41:47.627 --> 03:41:50.830
COMPANIES LOSE MARKET SHARE NOT

03:41:50.897 --> 03:41:51.965
GAIN OUT IN THERE THE DAY IT WAS

03:41:52.032 --> 03:41:52.499
JUST SITTING AROUND DOING

03:41:52.565 --> 03:41:53.433
NOTHING --

03:41:53.500 --> 03:41:56.403
THE AND SAID THE PROBLEM HAS

03:41:56.469 --> 03:41:57.470
BEEN IS.

03:41:57.537 --> 03:41:58.204
YOU KNOW THERE'S BEEN NO REAL

03:41:58.271 --> 03:41:59.406
COST ASSOCIATE ON THE OTHER SIDE

03:41:59.472 --> 03:42:00.707
TO MAKE THEM DO THE MINIMIZATION

03:42:00.774 --> 03:42:03.543
THIS BRINGS THAT COST AN AND A

03:42:03.610 --> 03:42:05.145
REALLY INCENTIVIZE COMPANIES. TO

03:42:05.211 --> 03:42:06.713
DO THE MINIMIZATION AND THEN THE

03:42:06.780 --> 03:42:07.681
LAST --

03:42:07.747 --> 03:42:08.882
RELATED POINT LIKE TO MAKE IS

03:42:08.948 --> 03:42:10.083
KIND OF WHAT THAT'S CONNECTED I

03:42:10.150 --> 03:42:11.484
REALLY LIKE TO UNDERSCORE IT.

03:42:11.551 --> 03:42:12.619
IS THAT --

03:42:12.686 --> 03:42:16.022
I'D BE WARY OF TO TO ANONYMOUS

03:42:16.089 --> 03:42:18.191
DATA -- TIME

03:42:18.258 --> 03:42:19.759
AND TIME AGAIN THIS IS PROVEN TO

03:42:19.826 --> 03:42:21.261
BE A FICTION IT'S A FICTIONAL

03:42:21.327 --> 03:42:22.362
CONCEPT --

03:42:22.429 --> 03:42:24.197
ANY DATA THAT I'VE EVER SEEN

03:42:24.264 --> 03:42:24.764
RELEASED TO THE PUBLIC THAT

03:42:24.831 --> 03:42:25.832
INCLUDES.

03:42:25.899 --> 03:42:28.101
A DATA SET THAT'S TIED TOGETHER

03:42:28.168 --> 03:42:29.269
TO AN INDIVIDUAL EVEN DOESN'T

03:42:29.335 --> 03:42:31.171
COULD IDENTIFIER JUST THESE KIND

03:42:31.237 --> 03:42:31.771
OF HALF IS THAT HE WAS TALKING

03:42:31.838 --> 03:42:32.539
ABOUT.

03:42:32.605 --> 03:42:34.207
ALWAYS HAS BEEN THE ANONYMIZED

03:42:34.274 --> 03:42:35.075
IN THE SEARCH --

03:42:35.141 --> 03:42:37.077
INDUSTRY INTO AND SIX A WELL

03:42:37.143 --> 03:42:39.512
RELEASED A FEW TO ANONYMOUS

03:42:39.579 --> 03:42:40.547
SEARCH DATA SET THE JUST HAD

03:42:40.613 --> 03:42:41.815
QUERIES TIED TOGETHER WITH NO

03:42:41.881 --> 03:42:44.517
PEOPLE ASSOCIATED.

03:42:44.584 --> 03:42:46.619
IT WAS THE ANONYMIZED THAT'S IT.

03:42:46.686 --> 03:42:47.287
THE SIDE FUNNY STORY BECAUSE

03:42:47.353 --> 03:42:48.722
MONTH SEARCH HOW TO KILL MY WIFE

03:42:48.788 --> 03:42:49.723
AND THEY FIGURED OUT IT WAS AND

03:42:49.789 --> 03:42:51.391
IT WAS LIKE A RIGHT I CRIME

03:42:51.458 --> 03:42:53.193
WRITER A TV WRITER --

03:42:53.259 --> 03:42:54.861
NETFLIX DID THE SAME THING THEY

03:42:54.928 --> 03:42:56.629
RELEASED THE RESEARCH DATA SAID

03:42:56.696 --> 03:42:58.131
ON A MOVIE RECOMMENDATIONS AND

03:42:58.198 --> 03:42:59.332
PEOPLE WERE ABLE TO THE

03:42:59.399 --> 03:43:00.567
ANONYMIZE THAT THERE'S BEEN

03:43:00.633 --> 03:43:02.635
CREDIT CARD ONCE IN ALL CASES

03:43:02.702 --> 03:43:03.970
WHAT HAPPENS IS THEY TAKE

03:43:04.037 --> 03:43:05.138
ANOTHER DATA SET.

03:43:05.205 --> 03:43:06.506
AND THEY PUT IT TOGETHER WITH

03:43:06.573 --> 03:43:08.508
THE PSEUDO ANONYMOUS DATA AND

03:43:08.575 --> 03:43:09.342
THEN IF YOU GRAVITY BLOCKS.

03:43:09.409 --> 03:43:10.844
SO I WOULD BE JUST WARY OF

03:43:10.910 --> 03:43:13.947
ANYONE WHO KIND OF CLAIMS OR ANY.

03:43:14.013 --> 03:43:14.914

03:43:14.981 --> 03:43:16.750
BODY COUNT OF FOR YOU AND SAYS

03:43:16.816 --> 03:43:17.383
OF THE SUIT ANONYMOUS THAT AS A

03:43:17.450 --> 03:43:17.917
THING.

03:43:17.984 --> 03:43:18.818
SO IN CONCLUSION OUR MISSION

03:43:18.885 --> 03:43:20.720
ADDUCT AGO HAS ALWAYS BEEN TO

03:43:20.787 --> 03:43:22.856
SET A NEW SANDARD TRUST ONLINE.

03:43:22.922 --> 03:43:26.626
AND THAT'S WHY WE SUPPORT --

03:43:26.693 --> 03:43:30.396

QUESTIONS FROM.

03:43:35.468 --> 03:43:37.670
THE DíAS I I HAVE ONE QUESTION --

03:43:37.737 --> 03:43:39.606
YOU STARTED YOUR COMPANIES WITH

03:43:39.672 --> 03:43:42.909
THAT COMMITMENT TO PRIVACY --

03:43:42.976 --> 03:43:45.445
COMPANIES THAT ARE MOVED BEYOND

03:43:45.512 --> 03:43:47.914
THAT AND ARE NOW USING --

03:43:47.981 --> 03:43:49.415
A BEHAVIORAL --

03:43:49.482 --> 03:43:51.684
ADVERTISE ADVERTISING AND IN

03:43:51.751 --> 03:43:53.953
SOME OF THESE MORE AGGRESSIVE.

03:43:54.020 --> 03:43:56.623
LESS OF PRIVACY FRIENDLY

03:43:56.689 --> 03:43:58.091
PRACTICES.

03:43:58.158 --> 03:43:59.459
IS IT GOING TO BE.

03:43:59.526 --> 03:44:04.063
IMPOSSIBLE FOR THEM TO PULL BACK

03:44:04.130 --> 03:44:04.864
AND START.

03:44:04.931 --> 03:44:05.765
RE KIND OF RE CONFIRMING A

03:44:05.832 --> 03:44:07.600
REAFFIRMING A COMMITMENT TO

03:44:07.667 --> 03:44:10.036
PRIVACY HOW IS THAT GOING TO

03:44:10.103 --> 03:44:12.739
IMPACT THEIR CURRENT MODELS.

03:44:12.806 --> 03:44:14.874
YEAH I I DON'T THINK SO I MEAN --

03:44:14.941 --> 03:44:16.176
I THINK WHAT YOU'RE REALLY

03:44:16.242 --> 03:44:17.110
TALKING ABOUT IS THE LARGEST

03:44:17.177 --> 03:44:17.744
COMPANIES HERE --

03:44:17.811 --> 03:44:19.245
TALK ABOUT GOOGLE AND FACEBOOK

03:44:19.312 --> 03:44:20.613
BECAUSE THEY'RE DRIVING IN.

03:44:20.680 --> 03:44:22.081
MOST OF THE ADS ON MOST OF THESE

03:44:22.148 --> 03:44:23.650
OTHER SITES --

03:44:23.716 --> 03:44:26.085
AND THE BEHAVIORAL ADVERTISING

03:44:26.152 --> 03:44:27.720
ALL YEAR ROUND SO YOU DO THE ONE

03:44:27.787 --> 03:44:29.122
GOOGLE SEARCH AND THEN IT'S YOU

03:44:29.189 --> 03:44:30.190
KNOW IF YOU SEARCH FOR SOME

03:44:30.256 --> 03:44:30.757
PANTS AND THE FOLLOWING YOU

03:44:30.824 --> 03:44:32.158
AROUND EVERYWHERE --

03:44:32.225 --> 03:44:34.928
THAT COULD JUST BE BACK TO JUST

03:44:34.994 --> 03:44:36.296
SHOWING DO A COULD SHOW AN AD

03:44:36.362 --> 03:44:37.964
JUST BASED ON THE PUBLISHER

03:44:38.031 --> 03:44:39.632
WEBSITE -- I

03:44:39.699 --> 03:44:40.900
ACTUALLY THINK IN THE LONG RUN

03:44:40.967 --> 03:44:42.202
THAT'LL MAKE THE MORE MONEY I

03:44:42.268 --> 03:44:43.136
THINK PEOPLE ARE GETTING

03:44:43.203 --> 03:44:45.271
INCREASINGLY ANNOYED BY THESE

03:44:45.338 --> 03:44:46.306
CREEPY ADS.

03:44:46.372 --> 03:44:47.640
AND THEY'RE GETTING LESS

03:44:47.707 --> 03:44:49.809
COLLECTS OVER TIME NOT MORE AND

03:44:49.876 --> 03:44:51.044
SOARING THIS WEIRD PERIOD WHERE

03:44:51.110 --> 03:44:52.478
IT MADE A BIT MORE MONEY BUT I

03:44:52.545 --> 03:44:54.180
THINK THEY'RE OVER TIME TO

03:44:54.247 --> 03:44:56.115
REALIZE THAT IT'LL BE MORE MONEY

03:44:56.182 --> 03:44:57.450
TO GO BACK TO GET TEXTILE ANYWAY.

03:44:57.517 --> 03:45:00.420
SO WHAT ABOUT ALEXA AND WHAT

03:45:00.486 --> 03:45:02.021
ABOUT THE SERVICE SYSTEMS NOW

03:45:02.088 --> 03:45:03.957
THAT SEEM TO BECOMING MORE AND

03:45:04.023 --> 03:45:06.793
MORE PREVALENT.

03:45:06.860 --> 03:45:08.061
WHERE?

03:45:08.127 --> 03:45:10.230
PEOPLE ARE RELYING ON THESE.

03:45:10.296 --> 03:45:12.332
VERBAL CUES TELLING PETE TELLING

03:45:12.398 --> 03:45:14.667
THIS THING TO GO AHEAD AND

03:45:14.734 --> 03:45:16.636
ADJUST THE THERMOSTAT OR PLAY

03:45:16.703 --> 03:45:19.973
MUSIC OR WHO KNOWS WHAT THINGS

03:45:20.039 --> 03:45:21.474
WE USED TO DO BY.

03:45:21.541 --> 03:45:23.776
OURSELVES WALKING OVER TO THE

03:45:23.843 --> 03:45:25.678
THERMOSTAT FOR EXAMPLE BUT

03:45:25.745 --> 03:45:27.146
RECOGNIZING IT'S A DIFFERENT

03:45:27.213 --> 03:45:29.449
WORLD HOW ARE IS THAT

03:45:29.515 --> 03:45:31.184
INFORMATION --

03:45:31.251 --> 03:45:32.752
I KNOW IT'S BEING.

03:45:32.819 --> 03:45:33.753
A YOU KNOW.

03:45:33.820 --> 03:45:35.688
PULLED INTO WHO KNOWS WHERE AND

03:45:35.755 --> 03:45:37.023
IT'S BEING USED FOR VARIOUS

03:45:37.090 --> 03:45:38.391
PURPOSES.

03:45:38.458 --> 03:45:39.259
IS THERE SOME WAY THAT PEOPLE

03:45:39.325 --> 03:45:40.727
COULD CONTINUE OR THAT THESE

03:45:40.793 --> 03:45:42.562
COMPANIES CONTINUE PROVIDING

03:45:42.629 --> 03:45:45.231
THAT SERVICE WITHOUT IT BEING SO

03:45:45.298 --> 03:45:47.166
INCREDIBLY INVASIVE OF OUR

03:45:47.233 --> 03:45:49.702
PERSONAL INFORMATION ABSOLUTELY

03:45:49.769 --> 03:45:51.004
SO INTRICATE REAL.

03:45:51.070 --> 03:45:53.806
LOW GRADE ON THAT POINT --

03:45:53.873 --> 03:45:56.609
SO THERE'S THERE'S NO OLOGY DONE

03:45:56.676 --> 03:45:57.810
MORALLY.

03:45:57.877 --> 03:45:59.445
RIGHT WE CAN DO ALL THE GREAT

03:45:59.512 --> 03:46:02.715
STUFF THE EVERYBODY WANTS.

03:46:02.782 --> 03:46:03.349
BUT JUST DON'T GO TO THE CREEPY

03:46:03.416 --> 03:46:04.350
LEVEL.

03:46:04.417 --> 03:46:07.854
AND IT'S THERE'S NO HARM.

03:46:07.921 --> 03:46:09.455
IN PROVIDING.

03:46:09.522 --> 03:46:11.057
CONTEXTUAL INFORMATION OR THE

03:46:11.124 --> 03:46:13.426

JUST EXACTLY WHAT IT IS YOU'RE

03:46:16.195 --> 03:46:17.096
ASKING.

03:46:17.163 --> 03:46:19.032
FOR SO TECHNOLOGY CAN ADVANCE

03:46:19.098 --> 03:46:20.166
INNOVATION CAN ABSOLUTELY

03:46:20.233 --> 03:46:21.434
ADVANCE.

03:46:21.501 --> 03:46:23.002
BUT WE CAN STILL PROTECT PRIVACY

03:46:23.069 --> 03:46:24.737

SAVE THAT THEY CAN ANSWER IT AND

03:46:38.384 --> 03:46:39.719
THROW IT AWAY?

03:46:39.786 --> 03:46:41.120
THANK YOU --

03:46:41.187 --> 03:46:43.423
CENTER COVER YET.

03:46:43.489 --> 03:46:46.225
I I DIDN'T GET TO HEAR EVERYONE

03:46:46.292 --> 03:46:48.561

REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS

03:46:50.763 --> 03:46:52.465
HERE TODAY BECAUSE PART OF THE

03:46:52.532 --> 03:46:53.833
DIFFICULTY IS THAT.

03:46:53.900 --> 03:46:57.003
AS WE STARTED USING THE DEVICS --

03:46:57.070 --> 03:47:00.840
THEY HAD LIMITED I REMEMBER BACK

03:47:00.907 --> 03:47:02.308
IN THE DAY WHEN THE CELL PHONE

03:47:02.375 --> 03:47:04.877
WAS LIKE A BRICK AND IT WAS NOT

03:47:04.944 --> 03:47:06.546
EASY TO USE --

03:47:06.612 --> 03:47:09.849
AND AND SO IT'S OVER TIME GOTTEN

03:47:09.916 --> 03:47:11.451
MORE AND MORE INTRUSIVE AND I I

03:47:11.517 --> 03:47:13.186
DIDN'T REALIZE IT WAS TRACKING

03:47:13.252 --> 03:47:14.921
THINGS UNTIL LIKE YOU SAID THESE

03:47:14.988 --> 03:47:16.456

PUT MY HOME IN HERE BUT MY

03:47:27.133 --> 03:47:28.434
TRAVEL HOME.

03:47:28.501 --> 03:47:29.569
HOW LONG IT TAKES ME TO GET

03:47:29.635 --> 03:47:31.104
THERE AND WHETHER THE TRAFFIC IS

03:47:31.170 --> 03:47:32.772
PARTICULARLY BAD THERE ARE TIMES

03:47:32.839 --> 03:47:34.574
WHEN THAT KIND OF INFORMATION IS

03:47:34.640 --> 03:47:36.042
GREAT BECAUSE THEN YOU CAN SAY

03:47:36.109 --> 03:47:37.210
TO HAVE DINNER BECAUSE IT'S

03:47:37.276 --> 03:47:39.045
GONNA TAKE ME A LOT LONGER?

03:47:39.112 --> 03:47:41.047
BUT BUT TIM REALIZED THAT THAT

03:47:41.114 --> 03:47:42.482
INFORMATION IS ACTUALLY BEING

03:47:42.548 --> 03:47:45.385
TRACKED AND SOLD AND USED AND

03:47:45.451 --> 03:47:48.354
AND MORE AND MORE ARE NOW COMING

03:47:48.421 --> 03:47:50.289
THAT WERE WHERE I MAY HAVE JUST

03:47:50.356 --> 03:47:52.125
PASSED PLACE I HAVEN'T STOPPED I

03:47:52.191 --> 03:47:53.693
HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING IT.

03:47:53.760 --> 03:47:55.695
I'M REALLY GLAD TO HEAR BECAUSE

03:47:55.762 --> 03:47:57.230
I KNOW THAT I CAN GET IN HERE

03:47:57.296 --> 03:47:59.365
AND AND AND STOP SOME OF THE

03:47:59.432 --> 03:48:01.200
TRACKING BUT I CAN'T FIGURE IT

03:48:01.267 --> 03:48:02.602
OUT EASILY.

03:48:02.668 --> 03:48:04.904
PARTLY BECAUSE SOME OF THE SITES

03:48:04.971 --> 03:48:06.939
WILL ASK ME DO YOU CAN I HAVE

03:48:07.006 --> 03:48:08.608
YOUR CONTACTS AND YOUR PHOTOS

03:48:08.674 --> 03:48:13.846
AND THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO REASON.

03:48:13.913 --> 03:48:14.280
FOR THOSE PARTICULAR

03:48:14.347 --> 03:48:17.850
APPLICATIONS I PUSH NO.

03:48:17.917 --> 03:48:19.819
THIRD BECAUSE NOW I KNOW AND I

03:48:19.886 --> 03:48:21.354
CAN'T USE THE UP AT ALL RIGHT

03:48:21.421 --> 03:48:23.156
AND SO I IT IT I REALLY

03:48:23.222 --> 03:48:24.724
APPRECIATE YOU SAYING THAT THAT

03:48:24.791 --> 03:48:25.892
THAT THAT THAT THERE ARE

03:48:25.958 --> 03:48:28.127
SOLUTIONS AND THAT WE CAN

03:48:28.194 --> 03:48:30.797
CONTINUE TO ADVANCE --

03:48:30.863 --> 03:48:33.633
THE USE OF ELECTRONIC DEVICES

03:48:33.699 --> 03:48:35.201
THAT MAKE LIFE EASIER --

03:48:35.268 --> 03:48:36.402
BUT I ALSO DON'T WANT TO BE

03:48:36.469 --> 03:48:37.937

FOR SOMEONE THAT'S OLD LIKE

YOUR PRIVACY SO I WANT TO BE

03:49:27.687 --> 03:49:28.588
CLEAR.

03:49:28.654 --> 03:49:30.723
THAT TECHNOLOGY CAN ADVANCE

03:49:30.790 --> 03:49:33.793
FASTER THAN YOUR MIND CAN HANDLE.

03:49:33.860 --> 03:49:36.329
WHILE STILL PROTECTING YOUR

03:49:36.395 --> 03:49:40.032

GOING TO BE SIGNIFICANT.

03:49:45.404 --> 03:49:47.306
AND SO I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT

03:49:47.373 --> 03:49:49.142
CALIFORNIA UNDERSTANDS HOW

03:49:49.208 --> 03:49:51.577
VALUABLE THAT IS.

03:49:51.644 --> 03:49:53.112

FROM ALL THE PANELISTS THIS IS

03:49:56.482 --> 03:49:57.250
REALLY.

03:49:57.316 --> 03:49:58.951
I KNOW I'VE BEEN INCREDIBLY

03:49:59.018 --> 03:50:00.353

BUT WE DO HAVE TO BE FLEXIBLE I

03:50:18.137 --> 03:50:21.607
THINK WE DO NEED TO PRIORITIZE --

03:50:21.674 --> 03:50:23.042
PRIVACY IS A CRITICALLY

03:50:23.109 --> 03:50:23.809
IMPORTANT RIGHT HERE IN

03:52:04.010 --> 03:52:06.846
HOW WE DO THAT TWIN SENIORS ARE

WE USE DATA TO FIND TO THE

03:52:15.288 --> 03:52:16.355
SENIORS BECAUSE THEY DON'T WAVE

CALIFORNIA.

03:53:00.900 --> 03:53:02.735
INCREASINGLY NOT SURPRISINGLY

03:53:02.802 --> 03:53:06.539
CAL IN THE COUNTRY --

03:53:06.605 --> 03:53:08.641
THEY REPRESENT AS MUCH AS 20% OF

03:53:08.708 --> 03:53:10.476
THE FUND RAISING SUPPORT TO ALL

03:53:10.543 --> 03:53:13.379

03:53:14.613 --> 03:53:16.415
PERSONAL VALUE TO SMALLER STATES

03:53:16.482 --> 03:53:19.285
AND REGIONAL ORGANIZATIONS ARE

03:53:19.352 --> 03:53:20.553
THAT MUCH MORE EVEN GREATER SO

03:53:20.619 --> 03:53:22.588
IT'S NOT AN EXAGGERATION TO SAY

03:53:22.655 --> 03:53:24.357
THAT RESTRICTING THE ABILITY TO

03:53:24.423 --> 03:53:25.858
REACH CALIFORNIA DONORS.

03:53:25.925 --> 03:53:27.093
DUE TO THE COST OF THIS YOU SEE

03:53:27.159 --> 03:53:28.394

INSIGHTS AND I'M SURE WE'LL HAVE

03:53:38.371 --> 03:53:39.705
FURTHER DISCUSSIONS.

03:53:39.772 --> 03:53:41.006
GOOD AFTERNOON.

03:53:41.073 --> 03:53:41.707
AND SENATORS BEN HAVING COME

03:53:41.774 --> 03:53:42.875
AFTER THE NATIONAL PAYROLL

03:53:42.942 --> 03:53:44.410
REPORTING CONSORTIUM WE HAVE

03:53:44.477 --> 03:53:46.312
SIMILAR CONCERNS TO THE CHAMBER

03:53:46.379 --> 03:53:47.513
OF COMMERCE RELATED.

03:53:47.580 --> 03:53:49.315
TO APPLICABILITY OF THE ACT TO

03:53:49.382 --> 03:53:50.983
EMPLOYMENT INFORMATION --

03:53:51.050 --> 03:53:52.985
WE THINK THERE WAS NOT AN INTENT

03:53:53.052 --> 03:53:54.253
TO INCLUDE THAT INFORMATION

03:53:54.320 --> 03:53:55.788
THERE DOESN'T SEEM TO BE POLICY.

03:53:55.855 --> 03:53:57.790
A DISAGREEMENT BUT I'VE HEARD

03:53:57.857 --> 03:53:59.558
LEGAL INTERPRETATIONS ALL ACROSS

03:53:59.625 --> 03:54:00.793
THE MAP WITH RESPECT TO THIS

03:54:00.860 --> 03:54:01.994
ISSUE AND I THINK IT'S ONE AREA

03:54:02.061 --> 03:54:03.028
THAT COULD BENEFIT FROM SOME

03:54:03.095 --> 03:54:04.463
CLARIFICATION IF THERE'S NOT A

03:54:04.530 --> 03:54:06.632
POLICY DISAGREEMENT SO WE WOULD

03:54:06.699 --> 03:54:07.233
ENCOURAGE THE LEGISLATURE TO

03:54:07.299 --> 03:54:07.767
CONSIDER.

03:54:07.833 --> 03:54:09.201
CLARIFYING THAT ISSUE FOR THE

03:54:09.268 --> 03:54:12.872
BENEFIT OF ALL PARTIES THANK YOU

03:54:12.938 --> 03:54:14.940

03:54:15.007 --> 03:54:15.775
MADAM CHAIR MIKE BELOW IT I WANT

I WOULD ASSOCIATE MYSELF AND

03:54:18.444 --> 03:54:20.212
WITH MR EBANKS COMMENTS I THINK

03:54:20.279 --> 03:54:21.113
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TROUBLE

03:54:21.180 --> 03:54:22.348
FINDING COMMON GROUND ON SOME

03:54:22.415 --> 03:54:24.583
ISSUES BUT I THINK THE ISSUE OF

03:54:24.650 --> 03:54:27.286
EMPLOYEES AS EMPLOYEES.

03:54:27.353 --> 03:54:28.788
NOT BEING CONSUMERS IS SOMETHING

03:54:28.854 --> 03:54:33.125

GET CARS FIXED FOR SAFETY I

03:54:41.700 --> 03:54:41.867
THINK --

03:54:41.934 --> 03:54:43.235
THAT'S SOMETHING WE COULD

03:54:43.302 --> 03:54:44.937
PROBABLY ALL GREE ON SOME

03:54:45.004 --> 03:54:46.739
TARGETED ISSUES IN TERMS OF

03:54:46.806 --> 03:54:48.073

YOU AND YOUR COMMITTEE ON I

03:54:52.845 --> 03:54:54.613
