START TODAY'S. SUBCOMMITTEE. WE HAVE A. THAT KIND OF A HODGEPODGE OF TOPICS TODAY'S WE'RE GONNA BOUNCE AROUND. THIS OF COURSE IS SUBCOMMITTEE WERE TWO ON EDUCATION FINANCE WE'RE GONNA START. OFF FIRST WITH. HASTINGS COLLEGE OF LAW. HASTINGS FOLKS HERE YES HERE THEY ARE. START WITH ISSUE NUMBER. SEVEN THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL FOR HASTINGS COLLEGE OF LAW. THE MORE INJECTS WALT FROM FRANCE I THINK FOR GIVING THE OPPORTUNITY DISCUSS. HE SINGS BECAUSE OF LOS BUDGET WITH YOU THIS MORNING. I UC HASTINGS IS AFFILIATED WITH THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA SYSTEM BUT IT'S GOVERNED INDEPENDENTLY. BITES ON BOARD OF GOVERNORS. LOCATED IN SAN FRANCISCO PRIMARILY SERVES STUDENTS SEEKING ADDRESS DOCTOR DEGREE BUT ALSO AS A MASTER OF LOS PROGRAMMING A MASTER STUDIES IN LAW PROGRAM. IN TWENTY SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN UC HASTINGS AND ROLL NINE HUNDRED FIFTY TWO FULL TIME EQUIVALENT STUDENTS OF THOSE NINE HER NINETEEN WERE JD STUDENTS. ANNUAL TUITION FOR ITS JURIST DOCTOR PROGRAM THIS YEAR IS FORTY FOUR THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED EIGHTEEN DOLLARS. IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN HE UC HASTINGS TOTAL BUDGET FUNDED PRIMARILY BY GENERAL FUND AND TUITION AND FEES. IS A ONE POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS WITH THE AMOUNT OF GENERAL FUND BEING TWELVE POINT SEVEN MILLION. IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN KNIFING THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROVIDES A TWO PERCENT AUGMENTATION TO UC HASTINGS THIS REPRESENTS AN INCREASE OF ONE POINT ONE MILLION DOLLARS. GENERAL FUND ONGOING BRINGING APPROPRIATIONS TO THE COLLEGE TO TOTAL THIRTEEN POINT EIGHT MILLION THANK YOU. JASON CONCENTRA CELILO. I WANT TO TOUCH ON TWO ISSUES FIRST AS THE BASE INCREASED SERB ADMINISTRATION JUST BY INTRODUCED AND THEN I'D LIKE TO TOUCH ON. THE HASTINGS BECAUSE SCHOOL ARMED BUDGET CONDITION WHICH ISN'T A TOPIC THAT WAS DISCUSSED AS PART OF. LAST YEARS BUDGET. DURING THE BASED INCREASE OUR MESSAGE HERE IS SIMILAR AS IT IS TO YOU SEEN CSU WHICH IS TO REVIEW THE COST INCREASES AT THAT BASE INCREASE SUPPORTS INDETERMINATE THOSE ARE YOUR HIGHEST PRIORITIES FROM SCHOOL. IF YOU TURN TO PAGE TWENTY FIVE OF YOUR AGENDA. YOU'LL SEE A TABLE THERE THAT DISPLAYS OF FUNDING AND SPENDING INCREASES FOR THE SCHOOL. ON THE LEFT HAND SIDE OF IT IS ARE THE FUNDING INCREASES INCLUDING THE BASE INCREASED. SPENDING INCREASES. IF YOU NOTICE THERE THOUGH THE TWO LARGEST OF SPENDING ITEMS WOULD BE A COP. FOR. STAFF. AND EAT UP BECAUSE. FOR HE SINGS. PROGRAM. ONE THINK. RECESS. LARGELY. WHILE SOME. IN ALL. SCHOOLS. COMMITTEE MAY RECALL. THAT DEFICIT IS LARGELY DUE TO A. COOL. A GOAT. SCORE PART. IN WEST. GETTING IN TWENTY. SCHOOL WOULD BEGIN A MULTI YEAR. THE SENATE. A KEY ACTION. IN THIS BUDGET YEAR. THAT DECISION WOULD AFFECT STUDENTS. STARTING FALL TWENTY TINA WOULDN'T OF. ACTUALLY PACKAGES FOR. ENROLLED IN THE SCHOOL SO THE FISCAL AFFECT. AND WOULD BE. IN ADDITION TO THIS YEAR THE SCHOOL DID SOME SEVERAL LONG TERM SCENARIOS IN WHICH YOU WOULD REDUCE. AND ELIMINATES DEFICIT OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS. THOSE PLANS GENERALLY CONSISTED OF A BEGINNING TO INCREASE TO. AND TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY TWO WHICH IS BEEN FLAT FOR ABOUT SIX YEARS AT THE SCHOOL. THE THE SCENARIOS ALSO INCLUDED VARIOUS COMPENSATION CREASES IN OTHER OPERATING COST INCREASES. THE DIFFERENT MATERIALS DEFERRED IN WHAT THE ASSUME SOME SCENARIOS HAD ALL. HIGHER TUITION INCREASES FOR STUDENTS AND HIGHER COST INCREASES. OTHERS HAD ON A LOWER TUITION INCREASES AND SUBSEQUENTLY LOWER COST INCREASES. YOU HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TODAY TO ASK THE SCHOOL ABOUT ITS LONG TERM PLANS ABOUT A PLANS REGARDING TUITION COST INCREASES AND TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT YOU'RE COMFORTABLE WITH THE DIRECTION IN WHICH THE SCHOOLS HEADING. THE SCHOOLS BUDGET CONDITIONAL LIKELY AFFECT YOUR DECISIONS I BUDGET DECISIONS THIS YEAR AND ON THE NEXT FEW YEARS. SOME QUESTIONS YOU COULD CONSIDER ASKING OR WHAT ARE THE SCHOOLS PLANS REGARDING TUITION OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS ARE YOU COMFORTABLE WITH THE LEVEL OF INCREASE OF THE SCHOOLS PLANNING. ARE YOU COMFORTABLE WITH THOSE SCHOOLS LEVEL OF COST INCREASES EACH YEAR. A GIVEN THAT THE SCHOOL US STILL CURRENTLY HAS A BUDGET DEFICIT THOSE ARE SOME OF THE QUESTIONS YOU CAN THROUGH ASKING TODAY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SO MY NAME IS DAVID SOARED UP CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER AM ACCOMPANIED BY MORSE RATNER OUR ACADEMIC DEAN. OF FIRST WE WOULD LIKE TO EXPRESS OUR APPRECIATION FOR THE ADMINISTRATION FOR THERE OF CONTINUED SUPPORT OF OUR OPERATIONS. SO WE ARE IN OUR FIFTH YEAR OF THE MULTI YEAR FUNDING PLAN THAT HAS ALLOWED US TO. ENGAGE. IN THE LONG TERM FINANCIAL PLANNING AND AND IN THE CONTEXT OF A VERY. CHALLENGING MARKET LEGAL EDUCATION. OF. WE. EMBRACE THIS LONG RANGE PLANNING PERSPECTIVE AND WE'D ADOPT A NUMBER OF ASSUMPTIONS THAT WE REFINE AND TEST AS TIME PROGRESSES. OF THE LEGEND WAS MENTIONS ONE OF THEM OF FEE INCREASES WE ARE GOING INTO OUR SIX YEAR. FLAT FEES. BASED ON OUR DISCUSSIONS LIVE JOURNAL AS WE HAVE MODERATED THE INCREASE PLAN FOR. AT NINETEEN TWENTY WHO EIGHTEEN NINETEEN. ONE NINETEEN TWENTY. A NINETEEN TWENTY TO BRING ABOUT A FIVE PERCENT INCREASE AND PINE WHICH IS THAT WE HAVE FEE DISCOUNTING WOULD STILL BE APPLICABLE TO. AND WE. MAKE ASSUMPTIONS ON STATE FUNDING A COMPLETE COMPENSATION WHERE IN THE MIDDLE OF COLLECTIVE BARGAINING NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE REPRESENTED EMPLOYEES. ARE NON REPRESENTED STAFF HAVE GONE FOR OVER A YEAR AND A HALF WITHOUT A OF THE COMPENSATION INCREASE IN THIS PART OF OUR PLAN GOING FORWARD. TO ADDRESS THOSE NEEDS. SO WE DO LOOK AT IT. AS. YOU MANAGING WITHIN THE OF THE MEANS THAT WE HAVE WE HAVE USING THEIR RESERVE STRATEGICALLY. AND THOSE RESERVES HAVE BEEN DEPLOYED TO A SUPPORT OUR OUR IN OF STUDENT FINANCIAL AID OBJECTIVES TOO AGAIN ATTRACT QUALITY STUDENTS IN A VERY VERY COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT. WE. OF ENGAGE IN TUITION DISCOUNTING IN ORDER TO BE COMPETITIVE WITH. OUR COLLEAGUES IN BOTH THE PUBLIC A LAW SCHOOL SPACE AS WELL AS PRIVATE INSTITUTIONS. AND WE WILL BE RATCHETING IT DOWN BEGINNING IN THE NEXT. IN THIS UPCOMING BUDGET CYCLE. FROM FORTY TWO PERCENT ABOUT THIRTY SEVEN POINT FIVE. SO. WE'RE ALSO ENGAGED AND. CAPITAL PROGRAMS TO INCREASE. STUDENT HOUSING STOCK AND SERVICE ARE TENDERLOIN. WHO ARE PARTNERING WITH OTHER ACADEMIC INSTITUTIONS SO SHARING RESOURCES? TO PROVIDE HOUSING THAT'S CRITICALLY NEEDED IN THE BAY AREA A OUR STUDENTS HAVE TO COMPETE WITH EMPLOYEES OF OF THE MID MARKET TECH COMPANIES OF. PUT HER. IN THE COMPETING FOR THE SAME MARKET RATE HOUSING THAT OF WORKERS THAT WORK IN HOTELS ARE COMPETING FOR ANSWERS A. POINT DEAL OF FLUX. WHILE OUR COST OF ATTENDANCE CONTRIBUTE TUITION HAS REMAINED FLAT HOUSING COSTS ARE BECOMING INCREASINGLY PROBLEMATIC WHO ARE WORKING VERY HARD. TWO OF THEM. INCREASE THE HOUSING STOCK TO. REMOVE A BARRIER TO ENTRY INTO THE LEGAL DUCATION THE CURRENTLY IS PROBLEMATIC FOR HASTINGS AS WELL AS MEMBERS CALIFORNIA'S SAN FRANCISCO. OKAY. QUESTIONS. NOW I THINK WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON THIS ISSUE IN THE LAST FEW YEARS AND AS. HAS THAT THE STAFF NOTES WE KNOW CONCERNS ON THIS PROPOSAL BUT WE WILL NOT TAKE ACTION TODAY WILL HOLD THE ISSUE OFTEN AND TAKE FINAL ACTION A FEW WEEKS. THANK YOU FOR THE PRESENTATION THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OKAY. SO WE'RE GOOD NOT ISSUE NUMBER EIGHT. THE OFFICE OF PLANNING AND RESEARCH. CALIFORNIA EDUCATION LEARNING LAB. AT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES TEN MILLION GENERAL FUND I'M GOING TO CREATE THE CALIFORNIA EDUCATION LEARNING LAB. AN INITIATIVE FOCUSED ON INTEGRATING LEARNING SCIENCE INTO INSTRUCTION IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF ONLINE HIGHER EDUCATION AT PUBLIC COLLEGES UNIVERSITIES. LEARNING SCIENCES AND INTERDISCIPLINARY FIELD SEEKS TO FURTHER OUR UNDERSTANDING OF HOW PEOPLE EARN THE PROCESSES OF LEARNING NOW LEARNING CAN BE SUPPORTED OR ENHANCED BY TECHNOLOGIES INSTRUCTIONAL PRACTICES DESIGN. AND LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS AND DIFFERENT CONTACTS. A PRIMARY GOAL OF THE PROPOSED INITIATIVES TO CUSTOMIZE LEARNING AND INCREASE CHANCES FOR PERSISTENCE AND LOWER DEFENSE LOWER DIVISION STEM COURSES. THROUGH THE SUFFERING SCIENCE. LOWER DIVISION IS OFTEN WHERE STUDENTS HAVE EXPRESSED INTEREST IN STEM MAY DROP OUT AFTER ONE OR TWO COURSES. MAKING IT AN IDEAL TIME TO INTERVENE TO IMPROVE OUTCOMES. THE FOCUS OF THIS INITIATIVE WILL BE TO READ DEVELOPER REDESIGN ONLINE HOWEVER COURSES TO SPECIFICALLY INTEGRATE ADAPTIVE LEARNING I TECHNOLOGIES IN THE PRINCIPLES OF LEARNING SCIENCE INTO THE CURRICULUM. THIS DIFFERS FROM THE EXISTING PROGRAMS THE SEGMENT EACH ON THEIR AGENDA. THOSE PROGRAMS SUPPORT THE DEVELOPMENT OF COURSES. WHILE THE LAB RESEARCH HOW STUDENTS LEARN TO OPTIMIZE ALMIGHTY HYBRID COURSES. ADMINISTRATION BELIEVES THAT LITTLE ATTENTION HAS BEEN PAID TO THE SCIENCE OF LEARNING AND HOW TO IMPROVE THE DELIVERY OF STEM EDUCATION. OUR MIND EDUCATION PRESENTS AN OPPORTUNITY TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF EDUCATION ACCESS FOR UNDERREPRESENTED STUDENTS. ACHIEVEMENT GAP GAPS IN COLLEGE PREPARATION OF AGREE ATTAINMENT IN STEM FIELDS EXIST ACROSS THE COUNTRY INCLUDING IN CALIFORNIA. ACCORDING TO STUDIES BY THE CITY. AMERICAN MILITANTS STUDENTS MEET. COLLEGE READINESS AND STEM BENCHMARKS AT HALF THE RATE OF THEIR WHITE NATION PEERS. THESE DISPARITIES ARE NOT CLOSE AT THE COLLEGE LEVEL AFTER AMERICAN WITH HOUSTON'S EARN SIGNIFICANTLY FEWER STEM DEGREES THAN THE ORIGINAL ACCOUNT FOR COUNTERPARTS BOTH UC AND CSU. FOR EXAMPLE WHICH INSTANCE IT SEE IF YOU MAKE A FORTY PERCENT OF ALL STUDENTS BUT ONLY TWENTY SIX PERCENT OF STUDENTS AWARDED AN ENGINEERING DEGREE. SIMILARLY AT THE UC. AFTER AMERICAN STUDENTS EARN PHYSICAL SCIENCES AND ENGINEERING DEGREES AT HALF THE RATE OF THEIR SYSTEM I POPULATION. BY EXPANDING OUR UNDERSTANDING OF HOW PEOPLE LEARN AND LEVERAGING ADVANCES IN TECHNOLOGY THE STATE CAN INCREASE LEARNING AND ACHIEVEMENT AMONG THESE GROUPS. THESE TECHNOLOGIES INCLUDE ADAPTIVE LEARNING SOFTWARE THAT DYNAMICALLY RESPONSES SINCE WHEN THEY STRUGGLE WITH THE CONCEPT AND PROVIDE INSTRUCTORS WITH DATA ON WHERE STUDENTS A NEED ADDITIONAL HELP. BUILDING LEARNING SYSTEMS THAT PROVIDE CONTINUOUS FEEDBACK AND ASSESSMENT CAN ACCELERATE STUDENT LEARNING. ANOTHER KEY GOAL THE LAP IS TO FOSTER COLLABORATION AMONG INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER EDUCATION. DEMAND FROM MY COURSES IS WINNING INCREASING AND AT EVERY SEGMENT. AND TWENTY FIFTEEN SIXTEEN THE CSU PROVIDED ONLINE INSTRUCTION TO A POPULATION EQUAL TO FIVE POINT FIVE PERCENT OF ALL FULL TIME EQUIVALENT STUDENTS. AND TWENTY SIXTEEN MORE THAN FIFTEEN THOUSAND STUDENT A FALTERING SIXTEEN WHETHER FIFTEEN THOUSAND STUDENTS ENROLLED IN ALL MY COURSES AT THE UC. AT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES THE SHARE OF ONLINE INSTRUCTION HAS NEARLY TRIPLED IN THE LAST TEN YEARS AND ALTHOUGH EACH OF THESE INSTITUTIONS HAS ITS OWN ONLINE EDUCATION INITIATIVE. COLLABORATION BETWEEN SEGMENTS IS LIMITED AT BEST AND THERE'S NOT A FOCUS ON THE EMERGING OPPORTUNITIES LEARNING SCIENCE REPRESENTS. TO ACHIEVE GREATER COLLABORATION CONSORTIA SEEKING GRANTS MUST CONSIST OF AT LEAST TWO TWO AT LEAST TWO INSTITUTIONS FROM DIFFERENT SEGMENTS. BASED ON CONVERSATIONS WITH FACULTY WE HAD DESPITE THE FLAP WITH PHONE SIX OR SEVEN PROJECTS A YEAR AROUND ONE POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS EACH WITH EACH PROJECT CONDUCTING ITS WORK OVER THREE YEARS. THE OFFICE OF PLANNING AND RESEARCH OR CONSULT WITH EXPERTS ALERTING SCIENCE AND STEM TO IDENTIFY QUALIFIED INDIVIDUALS TO SERVE ON THE SELECTION COMMITTEE. THE METRICS BY WHICH THESE PROJECTS WILL BE EVALUATED WILL BE DEVELOPED THROUGH THE REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL PROCESS. BUT COULD POTENTIALLY INCLUDE REDUCTIONS AND FAILURE RATES IMPROVEMENTS AND GREAT PERFORMANCE AND PERSISTENCE IN GRADUATION INCREASES IN MAJORS. THE FIRST THREE YEARS OF THE INITIATIVE THE SCOPE OF FINISH OF WOULD IT WOULD IT WOULD EXPAND. AS PROGRESS IS MADE IN STEM DISCIPLINES ADDITIONAL DISCIPLINES IN MAJORS BABY ADDED DEPENDED ON DEPENDING ON FEEDBACK A DEVELOPMENT FROM THE FIELD. THE LEVEL ALSO CARRIED A LIBRARY OF OPEN EDUCATIONAL RESOURCES THAT CAN BE USED BY OTHERS WORKING DEVELOP ONLINE AND HYBRID COURSES. LA A REAL QUICK AT. THAT TIME OUT TO GROW PLEASE. MCCARTY. CHAVEZ. MEDINA HERE. VOEPEL. OKAY THANK YOU. HOLSTEIN HOUSING WITH THE ANALYST'S OFFICE. THE GOVERNOR'S PURPOSE FOR TREATING THESE LEARNING LABS O. TO WHICH IS TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS FROM HISTORICALLY UNDERREPRESENTED GROUPS THAT EARNED STAND BACHELOR'S DEGREES. IS AN IMPORTANT GOAL THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE JUST CITED SOME DATA ON HOW STUDENTS FROM HISTORICALLY UNDERREPRESENTED GROUPS. HAVE A LOWER STANDARD ROMAN PERSISTENCE IN COMPLETION RATES THAN STUDENTS FROM OTHER GROUPS. THAT SAID WE HAVE SEVERAL CONCERNS WITH THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. FIRST RESEARCH IDENTIFIES A NUMBER OF REASONS FOR LOWER PARTICIPATION AND SUCCESS RATES AMONG STUDENTS FROM CERTAIN GROUPS. THESE REASONS INCLUDE DISPROPORTIONATE ATTENDANCE AT K. TWELVE SCHOOLS WITH LESS QUALIFIED MATH AND SCIENCE TEACHERS. I AND LESS ACCESS TO ADVANCED COURSES. LACK OF IT ANOTHER REASON IS LACK OF EXPOSURE TO ROLE MODELS OR MENTORS WHO WORK IN STEM FIELDS OTHER. REASONS FOR DISPARITIES ARE COULD. INCLUDE PARENTAL EXPECTATIONS AND THE FACT THAT STEM DEGREES SUCH AS ENGINEERING OFTEN REQUIRE MORE THAN THE TYPICAL HUNDRED TWENTY UNIT A DEGREE REQUIREMENTS WHICH SERVES AS AN ADDED BURDEN TO LOWER INCOME STUDENTS. TO PURSUE THESE DEGREES. GIVEN THESE UNDERLYING CAUSES IT'S UNCLEAR TO US HOW THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED SOLUTION ONLINE AND HYBRID COURSES THAT USE LEARNING SCIENCE WILL ADDRESS. THESE DISPARITIES IN A MEANINGFUL WAY. SECOND THOUGH ENROLLMENT IN ONLINE COURSES HAS BEEN INCREASING OVER THE YEARS AT COMMUNITY COLLEGES CAL STATE UNIVERSITY AND YOU SEE. THE VAST MAJORITY OF STUDENTS CONTINUE TO TAKE THEIR COURSES IN A FACE TO FACE ENVIRONMENT. IT'S UNCLEAR THEN HOW CREATING REDESIGNING ONLINE AND HYBRID COURSES. WOULD RESULT IN A WIDESPREAD IMPACT AND IMPROVEMENT. THIRD AS YOUR AGENDA NOTES ON PAGES TWENTY SEVEN TO TWENTY EIGHT. THE STATE ALREADY FUNDS ONLINE INITIATIVES THAT EACH SEGMENT. AND THESE INITIATIVES ALL FOCUS ON CREATING AND DESIGNING. ONLINE AND HYBRID COURSES AT THE LOWER DIVISION LEVEL SO AS TO INCREASE STUDENT LEARNING. GIVEN THAT IT'S UNCLEAR TO US WHY THE STATE NEEDS ANOTHER STATE FUNDED PROGRAM THAT ALSO FOCUSES ON CREATING INNOVATIVE LOWER DIVISION COURSES. FOR IF THE PROPOSAL REALLY JUST LACKS THE JUSTIFICATION OVERALL JUSTIFICATION FOR THE PROPOSED FUNDING LEVEL TEN MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR ON GOING. AND HOW SUCH AN AMOUNT WOULD ACHIEVE PROGRAM OBJECTIVES. SO WE RECOMMEND. THE LEGISLATURE REJECT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. INSTEAD THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT WANT TO TAKE SOME TIME TO IDENTIFY THE ROOT CAUSES. OF STEM DISPARITIES AFTER THREE SEGMENTS AND BASED ON WHAT I IS IDENTIFIED. OF THE STATE COULD CRAFT SOLUTIONS THAT ARE EITHER TAILORED TO THE SPECIFIC SEGMENTS. OR IT COULD BE INTERSECTING AT ALL OR INVOLVED THE K. TWELVE SYSTEM. THANK YOU AND HAPPY DANCERS. OKAY. QUESTIONS. CHAVEZ. IN ARE KNOW ONLINE EDUCATION AND STEM YOU KNOW THOSE ARE THE SHINY OBJECTS OF EDUCATION TODAY. BUT. FROM AN ORGANIZATIONAL STANDPOINT. THE COR COM RECEIVE EDUCATION THE STATE AS WE SET UP HAS SET IT UP IS INDIA. KATIE TWELVE SYSTEM. YOU KNOW THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES A C. ISSUES IN THE UC'S. WE. WHAT CHART COR COM TO SEE IN THIS I DON'T I DON'T SEE WHY WE'RE DOING THIS? BUT WHY YOU TAKEN LEAD IN THIS WE'RE IDEA OF INSTITUTIONS. THAT ARE TAKEN LEAD IN THIS. IT'S ARE QUESTIONS CHAVEZ OTHER REASON WORK IN THE STATE'S TRYING TO TAKE THE LEAD IN THIS AREA. IS BECAUSE ALTHOUGH THERE IN INDIVIDUAL SEGMENTS HAVE THEIR OWN ONLINE EDUCATION STEM IMPROVEMENT PROJECTS THIS LIMITED CALL A COLLABORATION COOPERATION ACROSS SEGMENT SOMETHING THAT THEY'VE INDICATED TO THE STATE. THAT THEY THEY THEY LOOK TO US TO OUR. TO TAKE THAT LEAD AND AND WORK WITH THEM TOO TO FOSTER THAT THAT SPIRIT COLLABORATION AND AND THESE. AVAILABILITIES AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR US SEGMENTS TO COLLABORATE AND THIS SPECIFICALLY. FOCUSING ON LEARNING SCIENCE EACH SEGMENT HAS ITS OWN DEVELOPMENT AS THE EARLIER NOTED HAS ITS OWN. PROGRAM FOR DEVELOPING ONLINE COURSES THIS FOCUSES ON INCREASING THE QUALITY OF THIS COURSE IS BY USING NEW TECHNOLOGIES ADAPTIVE LEARNING SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN PILOTED YOU SEE IN OTHER CAMPUSES. TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF OF ONLINE EDUCATION SO YOU'RE CORRECT IN SAYING THAT YOU KNOW WE HAVE THESE GREAT SYSTEMS OF EDUCATION AT THE K. TWELVE SYSTEM WITH THE THE PUBLIC ARE AT SEGMENTS THAT ARE DEDICATED TO. ASSISTANCE ACCESS. BUT THE STATE HAS A ROLE HERE IN CLARA AND FOSTER COLLABORATION BETWEEN THE SEGMENTS AND OUT TRYING TO PUSH THESE THESE NEW TECHNOLOGIES TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN. WE CAN ADDRESS THE. THAT THE NEED FOR QUALITY HIGHER EDUCATION UP IN THE ONLINE SPHERE AS STUDENTS CONTINUE TO AND SHOES ON MY EDUCATION AS A WAY TO AND TO RECEIVE INSTRUCTION. YEAH I. I'M SURE IF WE HAD THE. TOM TORTURE NOT HERE WE HAD CHEN IN THE PALATABLE BE SAYING. THEY'RE PUTTING QUALITY ALL THE TIME IN THEIR EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS. AND. IN THE GOVERNOR'S THE GOVERNOR HE'S EXECUTIVE BEGINNING CALM UNDOCUMENTED ON THE WANTS TO. BUT TO FORM AN ORGANIZATION TO DO THIS. TO ME DOESN'T MAKE A LOT OF SENSE AND. THE GRAND THIS IS NOT A LOT OF MONEY IN THE IN THE IN THE BUDGET WE'VE BEEN LOOKING AT BUT IT IS MONEY THAT COULD GO TO. ANY OF THESE INSTITUTIONS TO FURTHER THEIR EFFORT. SO FROM MY PERSPECTIVE I. I'M NOT SUPPORTIVE OF THIS I THINK IT'S. ITS A SHINY OBJECT CHASE AND. THE THE ELEMENT IS THIS. EDUCATION. AND THAT'S NOT OP ARES OR THE GOVERNOR'S JOB THAT'S ACTUALLY IN OUR EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS. HE VIEW WHAT'S GUIDANCE TO. GIVE ALL THE GUYS WHO WANTS TO. BUT TO FORM AN ORGANIZATION. TO GIVE GUIDANCE OR WILL COORDINATE THINGS THEN WE GOT THE WRONG PEOPLE RUN IN THE. THESE EDUCATION AND THAT'S THAT'S ANOTHER ISSUE SO I WON'T BE SUPPORTIVE OF. MR MEDINA. NOT TO. FOLLOW UP BOTH FROM THE. LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S. AND OF FROM MY COLLEAGUE OF MR CHAVEZ. I LIKE THE COMMENTS FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S THAT THAT OTHER THINGS COULD CERTAINLY BE DONE. TO HELP. STAND. IMPROVE STAND WITHIN A LATINO AND AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDENTS. A AND I APPRECIATE THE. VIEW THE. RECOMMENDATIONS OR SUGGESTIONS FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. AND I AND I WOULD ASK THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. YOU KNOW HOW HOW MUCH INCREASE WILL WE SEE TO PROGRAMS LIKE WENT DAY. MESA. THAT THE DO JUST THAT. YOU KNOW THAT WORK WITH A MINORITY STUDENTS. TO IMPROVE THEIR COLLEGE PERFORMANCE AND. COULD YOU ANSWER THAT QUESTION. MISTREATED I'M NOT AS FAMILIAR WITH THE WITH THE OTHER SEGMENTS BUDGETS. HOWEVER THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET DOES INCLUDE BROAD GENERAL PACE INCREASES TO ALL THE SEGMENTS SO THAT THEY CAN MANAGE THEREAFTER RESOURCES EFFECTIVELY. AND FOCUS ON THE PRIORITIES THAT THEY THINK ARE IMPORTANT CONSISTENTLY STATE GOALS. I I WILL MENTION THAT MY FATHER WAS A CIVIL ENGINEER AND A GETTING A DEGREE IN CIVIL ENGINEERING OF THE TIME WHERE THEY WERE PROBABLY NOT A LOT OF LATINOS GETTING DEGREES IN CIVIL ENGINEERING. AND SO I'VE ALWAYS HAD BEEN CONSCIOUS OF LA AND YOU KNOW HOW WE DO IN EDUCATION AND ENCOURAGING. A MINORITY STUDENTS WOMEN TO ENTER STEM STEM FIELDS AND I AGREE. WITH THE COMMENTS OF LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE THAT IT'S A GREAT GOAL BUT I ALSO. AM. A CAUTIOUS APPREHENSIVE THAT JUST TO INCREASING A FUNDING TEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR IMPROVING ONLINE IS GOING TO ACCOMPLISH THE GOAL AS IT SET OUT. AND AND I VERY MUCH AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUE MISTER CHAVEZ THAT. JUST BECAUSE IT'S A SHINY OBJECT DOESN'T MEAN IT'S THE BEST THING AND SO I AM VERY. A DUBIOUS ABOUT. APPROVING THIS AS WELL. OKAY. I DON'T THINK HAVING MORE TO ADD. AS WAS NOTED IN THE ANALYSIS BY OUR STAFF AS WELL YOU KNOW THIS IS THAT INTRIGUING PROPOSAL BUT WE WANT TO WAY THIS ON ALL OF OUR REQUESTS YOU KNOW WE VERY WE HEAR FROM OUR. CSU AND YOU SEE STUDENTS AS FAR AS FUNDING MORE ACCESS. AND. DIRECT SERVICES THE CAMPUS LEVEL SO WE'LL TAKE A LOOK AT THIS IN TOTALITY. SO WITH THAT WILL HOLD THIS ISSUE OPEN. BY WE'RE GOING TO. GO NOW TO ISSUE NUMBER THREE THE STATE LIBRARIAN. FOR WAITING FOR A FEW MEMBERS TO TALK ABOUT ISSUES AND ONE AND TWO SO WE'LL. PROCEED NOW WITH THE CALIFORNIA STATE LIBRARY. PLEASE COME UP. OKAY WE WILL BEGIN WITH ISSUE NUMBER THREE. DAN OR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. THE CALIFORNIA STATE LIBRARY SERVES A CRITICAL ROLE IN STATE GOVERNMENT BY SERVING AS A CENTRAL REFERENCE POINT FOR THE GOVERNOR AND LEGISLATURE. ADDITIONALLY THE STATE LIBRARY PROVIDES CRITICAL ASSISTANCE IN DISTRIBUTES FEDERAL FUNDS. TO THE ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FOUR LIBRARY JURISDICTIONS HERE THEY HUNDRED LIBRARIES ACROSS THE STATE. OVERALL THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROVIDES THIRTY FIVE POINT NINE MILLION DOLLARS. IN GENERAL FUND SUPPORT TO THE STATE LIBRARY IN DOT THIS YEAR. AND. THIS INCLUDES A PROPOSALS TOTALING NINE POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS. THIS YEAR OF WHICH THREE POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS ON GOING. THESE PROPOSALS ENABLE THE STATE LIBRARY TO FURTHER ITS MISSION TO PROVIDE CALIFORNIANS WITH GREATER ACCESS TO INFORMATION. THE FIRST SET OF PROPOSALS ENABLE THE STATE LIBRARY TO ASSIST LOCAL LIBRARIES WITH INTERNET CONNECTIONS. THE STATE LIBRARY HAS A CONTRACT WITH THE CORPORATION FOR EDUCATION NETWORK INITIATIVES. AND CALIFORNIA BETTER KNOWN AS SCENIC. TO PROVIDE INTERNET FOR LIBRARY PATRONS. TELL MAXIMIZE THE EFFORTS OF THIS CONTRACT. THE BUDGET PROPOSES TWO MILLION DOLLARS IN ONE TIME FUNDING FOR BROADBAND EQUIPMENT GRANTS TO PROVIDE WHAT. GRANTS DELIVERY DISTRICTS TO CONNECT. MORE LIBRARY BRANCHES TO THE BACKBONE. ADDITIONALLY THE BUDGET PROPOSES THREE MILLION DOLLARS IN ONE TIME GRANTS. IN ONE TIME FOR BROADBAND CAPACITY GRANTS THAT WILL HELP TO EXPAND. THE LIBRARY CONNECTIVITY LEVELS ARE BRANCHES ALREADY CONNECTED TO THE SCENIC BACKBONE. ADDITIONALLY THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROVIDES THREE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS AND ONGOING SUPPORT. TO FUND THE FEES AND SURCHARGES ASSOCIATED WITH THE SCENIC CONTRACT AND A HUNDRED AND THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS TO ESTABLISH AN EERIE CONSULTANT POSITION. THAT WILL WORK TO SECURE STATEWIDE FUND. STATEWIDE DISCOUNTS TO THE FEDERAL EDUCATION RIGHT PROGRAM. JASON CONCENTRA SELLING NO. AS NOTED IN YOUR AGENDA ON PAGES FIFTEEN AND SIXTEEN THERE ARE FOUR ISSUES BEFORE YOU. OF THE THREE MILLION DOLLARS TO EXPAND INTERNET CAPACITY FOR LIBRARIES THAT ARE ALREADY CONNECTED TO THE SCENIC BACKBONE. TWO MILLION DOLLARS FOR EQUIPMENT GRANTS FOR ADDITIONAL LIBRARIES TO CONNECT TO THE SCENIC BACKBONE. AND THEN THE FUNDING FOR IT FOR SCENIC OPERATIONS AND THE FUNDING FOR A NEW POSITION AT THE STATE LIBRARY. SAW ALL WALK THROUGH EACH OF THOSE IN THAT ORDER. ON THE THREE MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE INTERNET CAPACITY GRANTS. AND IT'S A PROPOSAL TO THE LEGISLATURE THE ADMINISTRATION NOTED THAT LIBRARIES ARE UNDERGOING A MULTI YEAR PROCESS TO REVIEW THEIR LIBRARY NEEDS AND THEIR LIBRARY CAPACITY NEEDS. WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE WAIT FOR THE THOSE ASSESSMENTS TO BE COMPLETED IN AND REVIEW THE FINDINGS OF THOSE ASSESSMENTS TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE NEED THAT LIBRARIES HAVE AND THE ASSOCIATED COSTS. WE RECOMMEND REJECTING THIS PROPOSAL IN THIS YEAR IN REVISITING AT ONCE THOSE FINDINGS ARE AVAILABLE. ON THE TWO MILLION DOLLAR. PROPOSAL FOR THE EQUIPMENT GRANTS AS YOUR AGENDA NOTES WHEN WE RODE OUR ANALYSIS WE'RE WAITING ON SOME ADDITIONAL OF FINALIZE DATA OF LIBRARIES THAT WERE INTERESTED IN CONNECTING TO SEE NAKED TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN. THAT DATA WAS RECENTLY MADE AVAILABLE TO OUR OFFICE IT'S A HUNDRED AND FIFTY TWO LIBRARIES AND FOURTEEN JURISDICTIONS. OVER NINETY PERCENT OF THOSE LIBRARIES ARE REALLY LOCATED IN THREE JURISDICTIONS. COUNTY OF LA SAN DIEGO COUNTY IN OAKLAND. WE'RE STILL REVIEWING THAT DATA AND WE PLAN TO PROVIDE YOU A OF A MORE A MORE FINAL FISCAL ESTIMATE OF THIS PROPOSAL. A CLOSER TO BUDGET CLOSE OUT. ON THE REMAINING TWO PROPOSALS THE SCENIC OPERATION COSTS AND A NEW POSITION AT THE STATE LIBRARY WE THINK THE LEGISLATURE LACKS SOME OTHER CRITICAL INFORMATION TO FULLY ASSESS THESE PROPOSALS. IN THE CASE OF THE THE SCENIC COSTS LEGISLATURE LACKS BASIC UNDERSTANDING OF SCENIC BUDGET THE VARIOUS COST INCREASES THAT. THE ORGANIZATION FACES OVERALL EACH YEAR. AND THEN SECONDLY. OF HOW THOSE COSTS SHOULD BE SCOTT SHARED AMONG THE SEGMENTS THAT YOU SEEN ACT THAT INCLUDES YOU SEE CSU THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES SCHOOLS. WE DO KNOW THAT BASED ON WHAT WE'VE BEEN. WHAT'S BEEN REPORTED TO US FROM YOU SEEN CSU THAT THOSE SEGMENTS PAY FOR A HALF MILLION DOLLARS. THAT'S THE SAME THAT THE THAT LIBRARIES ARE EXPECTED TO PAY THE LIBRARY SURE THAT COST HALF WITH THE GENERAL FUND HALF WITH. A STATE SPECIAL FUNDS. THAT DIDN'T SEEM TO BE MUCH RATIONAL TO US THERE IT'S LIKELY THAT YOU SEE IN CS YOU HAVE HIGHER USAGE ESPECIALLY YOU SEE GIVEN THAT IT'S A RESEARCH UNIVERSITY. HOWEVER WE DON'T HAVE MORE A BETTER DATA ON A CURRENT USAGE TO FULLY ASSESS THAT'S WE CAN'T REALLY ASSESS WHAT LOOKS STATE LIBRARIES PORTION OF THOSE COSTS SHOULD BE. ON THE NEW POSITION OF STATE LIBRARY LIKEWISE WE THINK THE ADMINISTRATION TO PROVIDE A MORE DETAILED ANALYSIS OF THE VARIOUS WORKLOAD THAT EXISTS. AT SCENIC AT THE STATE LIBRARY AND THE KHALIF ANOTHER ORGANIZATION THAT PROCESSES PAYROLL ON BEHALF OF LIBRARIES. OF FORCING NECK. THAT WORKLOAD ANALYSIS WOULD BETTER ALLOWS TO TO IT UNDERSTAND THE VARIOUS ACTIVITIES THAT EACH SEGMENT IS INVOLVED IN WHEN IT COMES TO. DEALING WITH CERTAIN SCENIC ACTIVITIES INCLUDING. A LEVERAGING  <u>&lt;c.green&gt;RATE DISCOUNTS&lt;/c&gt;</u> AS WELL AS I UNDERSTAND IT EXISTING AND NEW WORKLOAD FOR ALL THESE ORGANIZATIONS MOVING FORWARD. THANK YOU. IF YOU. WELCOME BACK. STATE LIBRARIAN. YOU BACK THERE THANK YOU OKAY. NICE TO SEE YOU MISTER CHAIR YES WE LIKE TO SAY ANYTHING ABOUT THIS SPECIFIC. PROPOSAL THERE'S ALL LAID OUT ALREADY. YOU KNOW THE NINE POINT FIVE MILLION THAT DAN LAID OUT A NINE POINT SEVEN. MINUTES THE PRODUCT OF CONVERSATIONS BETWEEN THE ADMINISTRATION BETWEEN. SCENIC. AND AND THAT CALIFORNIA LIBRARY ASSOCIATE. SORRY. AND SO. MEAN IS IT A. I MEAN IF IT WAS UP TO ME. RIGHT I TO I WOULD RECOMMEND THE STATE SPEND TEN TIMES THIS AMOUNT ON AN ONGOING BASIS AND TO SUPPORT PUBLIC LIBRARIES. BUT POLICY THAT POLITICS IS THE ART OF THE POSSIBLE AND SO THIS IS A GOOD COMPROMISE THAT MOVES FORWARD. INITIATIVES THAT HELP THE LIBRARIES ALL OVER CALIFORNIA IN EVERY DISTRICT. THE JEWEL REPRESENT TO BETTER SERVE THE PEOPLE THAT WALK IN THE DOOR. QUESTIONS COMMITTEE MEMBERS. IF YOU TRAVIS. THE SCENIC CONTRACTS FOUR POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. WHO IS WHO IS RESPONSIBLE TO MANAGE IT IN MY OTHER LIFE WE USED TO CALLING COURSE? YOU KNOW THE CONTRACTING OFFICER HOOTON POSSIBLE TO MANAGE THE FOUR POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLAR CONTRACT TO SEEN ACT. WHO'D WHO DOES THAT. WHAT? WHAT WILL CARL AS JASON SAID THERE'S EACH SEGMENT PAYS THE FOUR POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS? RIGHT RIGHT A LIKE I THINK OF THEM AS DO ISTHAT WE PAY TO PARTICIPATE IN SCENIC EVERY YEAR. SO IT. WHO MANAGES THE CON TRACT A MAIN WE OVERSEE OUR? THE FOUR POINT FIVE MILLION THAT'S PAID ON BEHALF OF PUBLIC LIBRARIES. WHO PUBLIC LIBRARY PAYS FOUR POINT FIVE MILLION DESY NECK THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA PAYS THE MONEY HALF THROUGH THE GENERAL FUND? AND THE OTHER HALF THROUGH THE CALIFORNIA CAN TELL CONNECT FUND. RIGHT. OKAY SO WE'RE GIVING THEM FOUR POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS RIGHT WE'RE GIVING THEM FOUR AND A HALF MILLION DOLLARS THE PROPOSAL BEFORE YOU IS TO AUGMENT THAT BY THREE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND I KNOW THAT. CAN WRITE A QUESTION I'M TRYING TO GET TO WHO'S RESPONSIBLE. TO ENSURE THAT SEEN ACT. EXECUTES THEIR AGREEMENT VISIT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IS AT THE LIBRARY IS. WHO WHO'S THE PERSON HAS GOT THE BELLY ON THE BUTTON? I DO THIS. THAT WAS SPENT AND A FOUR POINT FIVE OF THE FOUR POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS CORRECTLY. WHO'S THAT PERSON. YOU KNOW FRANKLY WHAT WE DON'T HAVE GREAT INFORMATION ON SEE NIX OPERATIONS WE DON'T OF GREAT INFORMATION ON THE LEVEL OF OVERSIGHT THAT. EACH OF THE SEGMENTS PROVIDE I CAN'T REALLY SPEAK TO THAT AT ONE OF OUR. ONE OF OUR CONCERNS HERE IS THAT WE DON'T HAVE A GOOD UNDERSTANDING OF THE EXISTING OPERATING COST FOR SCENIC AND SO THAT'S WHY WE HAVE A PART TIME SERVICE TESTING THIS PARTICULAR SCENIC IT'S HERE DID YOU WANT THEM TO COME UP AND ANSWER YOUR QUESTION. YEAH WE'RE GOING TO GIVE HIM FOUR POINT EIGHT MILLION BUCKS ALIKE KNOWS WHAT WE'RE GONNA MORE THAN THAT IT'S IT'S FOUR POINT FIVE PER SEGMENT PER SEGMENT THAT'S RIGHT SO THAT HOW MANY SEGMENTS. THOUGHT WHAT'S YOUR PUBLIC LIBRARIES COMMUNITY COLLEGES STATE UNIVERSITIES IN THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SO FIVE TIMES FOUR POINT FIVE. YES SO YOU WANT TO BRING SOMEBODY HAPPEN BUT IT. PRESENT FIRST. BRIEF MOMENT. SO WE'RE TALKING TWENTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS A. MORNING CAME LESS REPRESENTING SIMAK AND SO THE CONTRACT IS ACTUALLY BETWEEN SCENIC IS WITH COOLEY FACTLY BOTH THE AGGREGATOR ON BEHALF OF THE STATE LIBRARY. WHO MANAGES THE LIBRARIES PARTICIPATION INTO SEEN THAT? I'M WITH THE ALLOW LIBRARY PORTION WE'RE ABLE TO DRAW CTF TELECOM NECK DISCOUNTS ON BEHALF AND SETS TO AUGMENT THE GENERAL FUND APPROPRIATION. AND BECAUSE OF THAT WE ARE REQUIRED TO PAY IN TAXES AND SURCHARGES ON THAT AMOUNT WHICH YOU SEEN SINCE YOU DO NOT HAVE TO BECAUSE THEY DO NOT. I'M THERE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR CTF FUN BECAUSE IT IS ONLY ELIGIBLE FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGES K. TWELVE. LIBRARIES AND CBO SO BECAUSE OF THAT WE'RE SAVING ON THAT SIDE BY NOT PAYING THE TAXES AND SURCHARGES FOR YOU SEEN CSU. BUT WE DO HAVE TO DO THAT FOR THE OTHER ONES IN ORDER TO RECOUP CTF COSTS. SO THAT'S WHY IT'S SLIGHTLY MORE TO PAY FOR THOSE TAXES AND SURCHARGES BECAUSE IN ORDER TO ACCESS THE CTF WITH ONE THE RULES FROM THE. PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION. BOY. HOW? WELL NOT AT ALL BUT IT SOUNDS TO ME IS JUST RAN THROUGH THE AYE HYDRATE AYE ME THEM. CFI DIFFERENT PEOPLE GIVEN THE SUPPORT PENA FIVE IN THAT ONE HALF MILLION OR FOUR POINT EIGHT MILLION BABIES. YOU JUST GAVE ME OUT A SPAGHETTI DEL FOR SOMEBODY. THE. AND THE OTHER FOR GAS TO DOING SOMETHING DIFFERENT. THIS IS THE SAME FOR CAPABLE LIBRARIES AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES. SO THERE FIVE PEOPLE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE EXECUTION OF THE CONTRACT. BUT MAY I THINK WHAT YOU'RE ASKING IS FOR EACH OF THE SEGMENTS WHO RIDE SHOTGUN OVER THIS CONTRACT YET. ABUSE WHO MAKING SURE THAT SUBTLE MY NO. DON'T DON'T PROMISE TO GET YOU JUST TELL ME. THIS PERSON RESPONSIBLE HERE THAT'S FROM THE KHALIFA MANAGES OUR CONTRACT FOR THE STATE LIBRARY. AND SO THEY REPORT TO THE STATE LIBRARY BUT IT'S DIFFERENT FOR THE OTHER AND THEY FOR K. TWELVE THAT IS THROUGH THE IMPERIAL OFFICE OF ANNA FORWARD COMMUNICATIVE THREW BICU COMMUNICANTS. I AM THREE CSU IT'S THROUGH THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE AND YOU SEE THROUGH THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE. GOD ALMOST SEEM LIKE BE BETTER THAT EACH ONE OF THEM WOULD BE BRIEF QUESTION THE MONEY SIR. RESPONSIBLE FOR MANAGING IT VERSES I JUST DON'T TWENTY MILLION BUCKS OUT THERE AND SAYING. DO DO GOOD AND GO FORTH. OKAY. VERY CONFUSED THANK I'VE THIS NOTHING LIKE I'VE EVER SEEN BEFORE AS TO DO CONTRACTING. FOR ME GO OVER TWENTY YEARS IN THE MILITARY AND WE HAVE A VERY CLEAR. BEFORE WE'RE GONNA COMMIT FEDERAL FUNDS TO SOMETHING WE HAVE A CONTRACT IN OFFICIALS RESPONSIBLE EXECUTING EVERYTHING WHERE BAND FOR. IN THE THIS APPEARS TO BE FIVE DIFFERENT PEOPLE IN A CONTRACT. AND IT'S DIFFERENT WITH THIS GROUP DIFFERENT OF THAT GROUP YOU KNOW IT'S LIKE THAT LITTLE AT. YOU KNOW TEXAS HAS A* HOUSE IN A LITTLE HAT DANCE AROUND. YOU KNOW YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT. SO. A. THANKS. OKAY ON. SHARE WHAT'S. OKAY. WE'LL HOLD THIS ISSUE OPEN WILL NOW PROCEED WITH THE NEXT STATE LIBRARY PROPOSAL RELATES TO RESOURCE SHARING. BERMAN A FINANCE. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROVIDES ONE POINT FOUR FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN ONE TIME GENERAL FUND. GO BE USED TO DEVELOP TO ONLINE SERVICE SYSTEMS. ONE MILLION WILL BE USED TO HELP ESTABLISH A ZIPLOC SYSTEM. THIS ALLOWS LIBRARY PATRONS IN MORE THAN A FAT IN MORE RURAL AREAS. TO PURCHASE MATERIALS THAT WOULD THEN BECOME PART OF THEIR LIBRARY'S COLLECTION. FURTHER FORTUNE FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS WILL BE USED TO CREATE MORE LOAN PROGRAMS BETWEEN MY RE DISTRICTS. THE COUNTIES NORTH OF SAN FRANCISCO HAVE AGREED TO CONNECT THEIR ONLINE CATALOGS. THIS PROPOSAL WOULD PROBABLY PROVIDE THE INITIAL. SET UP BE IS NECESSARY TO ESTABLISH A CONNECTION. THE HERB YOU HAVE TO ISSUES BEFORE YOU HEAR THE ZIP PROPOSAL AND THE PROPOSAL INVOLVING THE AND A CONSORTIUM IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA BOTH ACTIVITIES. TO A SEEM PRIMARILY TO HAVE LOCAL BENEFITS IN OUR LOCAL ACTIVITIES THAT LOCAL LIBRARIES CAN. ALREADY PART YOU CAN ALREADY SORT OF ENGAGE IN. SO IT IS THE NEED FOR ADDITIONAL STATE FUNDING WASN'T CLEAR TO US ABOUT TO THE EXTENT THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO PROVIDE AN ORGAN. PRIDE A STATE FUNDING FOR THIS. BUT UP O. THESE PRIORITIES WE WOULD NOTE THAT. THE STATE ALREADY PROVIDES THREE POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY TO THE A CALIFORNIA LIGHT THE LIBRARY SERVICES ACT ONE OF THE KEY. OF. OUR REASONS FOR THAT AT ONE OF THE KEY. REASONS WHY THIS ACT EXISTS IS TO FOSTER RESOURCE SHARING ACROSS THE STATE AND SO YOU COULD OF APPROPRIATE THAT EXISTING THREE POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS FOR THESE. ISSUES IF THEY ARE PRIORITIES FOR YOU. THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU STATE LIBRARY. COULD AGAIN I I WOULD SAY WHAT WE WHAT I SAID BEFORE IS THAT THESE ARE PART OF A GROUP OF PROPOSALS THAT WERE MUTUALLY. AGREED UPON AND CREATED BY THE. BY THE ADMINISTRATION BY THE SCENIC ROUTE HAVE LIVE ON THE LAST ONE AND BY THE CALIFORNIA LIBRARY ASSOCIATION THE VALUE THAT I'VE SEEN. IN VISITING PARTS OF CALIFORNIA PARTICULARLY UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES IN RURAL AREAS THAT BENEFIT FROM ZIP BOOKS THAT TO ME THAT DEMONSTRATE SAY. PLOT PLENTY OF STATEWIDE VALUE AND TO THE EXTENT THAT YOU'RE LIVING SOMEWHERE NORTH OF. IF. BACKING UP SO A PRIMARY PURPOSE OF LIBRARIES IS TO ON RAMP PEOPLE TO WHAT THEY ARE LOOKING FOR RIGHT TO PROVIDE INFORMATION. SO HERE'S A ONE TIME EXPENDITURE OF IT WHAT IS IT AGAIN THEN IT'S LIKE FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY GRANDER OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. THAT TAKES THE CATALOGS OF ALL OF THE SMALLER LIBRARIES IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA LINKS THEM TOGETHER SO THAT YOU CAN SIT AT YOUR LAPTOP FIND LOOK FOR A BOOK THAT YOU WANT. AND HIT A BUTTON INCOME DEAR LIBRARIAN GET AS OPPOSED TO GOING HERE SMALL LIBRARY WITH THE SMALLER CATALOG IN THESE ARE THE SORTS OF MECHANISMS THAT HELP. LIBRARIES DO A BETTER JOB OF FULFILLING THEIR MISSION IN THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY. OKAY AND. RIGHT DUMPING AGAIN IF YOU TAKE EVERY SINGLE THING ON THIS LIST NINE POINT SEVEN MILLION. WHAT WHAT WHAT IS THAT IS THAT IT'S LIKE LESS THAN ONE ONE HUNDREDTH OF ONE PERCENT OF THE STATE GENERAL FUND? SO. IT'S NOT LIKE WE'RE BREAKING THE BANK AT MONTE CARLO HERE. WELL SET OKAY. MR MEDINA. TO THE STATE LIBRARIAN COULD YOU JUST GIVE ME A LITTLE BIT MORE EXPLAINED TO ME THAT ZIP BOOK. PROGRAM AS IT LOOKS AS A DIFFERENT IT'S A DIFFERENT METHOD OF DELIVERY THAT USES THE ONLINE MARKETPLACE SO NORMALLY YOU'D WALK INTO A LIBRARY IN YOUR DISTRICT AND SAY I WANT THIS BOOK THE LIBRARY SAYS WE DON'T HAVE IT. WILL BORROW IT FROM ANOTHER LIBRARY SO THAT CAN TAKE UP TO TWO WEEKS BASICALLY OF THAT PUT IT ON A TRUCK AND DRIVE IT TO YOUR LOCATION. THIS IS THE OPPOSITE OF THAT SO YOU COME OF THE LIBRARIAN SAID I WANT THIS BOOK THEY SAY WE DON'T HAVE IT. WILL BITE FOR IT WHEN IT SHOWS UP IN YOUR MAILBOX A DAY OR TWO LATER BY USING THE ONLINE MARKETPLACE WHEN YOU'RE DONE. YOU BRING IT BACK TO THE LIBRARY. AND. THEY PUT IT ON THE SHELF THEY ADDED TO THEIR COLLECTION. OR IF THEY'VE ALREADY GOT YOU KNOW. PLENTY OF COPIES OF IT THEY THEY SELL UNDER USE THAT. IN SOME OTHER WAY TO BENEFIT THE LIBRARY AND THIS WOULD PROVIDE SIXTY THOUSAND OF THOSE. IS WHAT IN IRAN'S ACTIONS RIGHT TRANSACTIONS IT DOESN'T A YOU KNOW IT'S NOT GONNA TAKE THE PLACE OF BORROWING IN EVERY CIRCUMSTANCE I MEAN IT WORKS WITH. LIKE WHAT YOU CAN GET EASILY ON THE ONLINE MARKETPLACE SO IF YOU'RE IN TWO IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING TECHNICAL THEIR ACADEMIC OR. AND GET YOU KNOW LIKE GENEALOGICAL SORT OF SOMETHING VERY SPECIFIC YOU SEE THE LOANING THE TRADITIONAL LOAN PROGRAM IS REALLY. ALL THAT YOU CAN USE BUT THIS AN ALTERNATIVE AND WHAT THEY FIND IT WHAT'S. GO FIGURE IS THAT MOST OF THESE BOOKS THAT ARE BOUGHT THROUGH ZIP BOOKS RIGHT CIRCULATE MORE THAN THE OTHER ONES BECAUSE IT'S LIKE WHAT PEOPLE WANT TO READ THROUGH THE ODDLY ENOUGH RIGHT. THEIR SETS THANK YOU. OKAY. THANK YOU WILL HOLD THIS ISSUE. OPEN AS WELL. ISSUE NUMBER FIVE. LIBRARY LITERACY SERVICES. ABOUT. WHAT IS YOUR IN TWENTY FIVE LIBRARY JURISDICTIONS VOLUNTARILY PARTICIPATE IN THE STATEWIDE LEIBER'S LIBRARY LITERACY PROGRAM? THE SERVICES PROVIDED BY THESE LOCAL LIBRARIES COMPLEMENT EFFORTS BY OTHER STATE PROGRAMS TO INCREASE LITERACY LEVELS AMONG SAW AGE GROUPS. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROVIDES. PROPOSES PROVIDING TWO POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN ONGOING GENERAL FUND TO EXPAND THESE PROGRAMS. THIS ADDITIONAL FUNDING PROVIDED IN THIS PROPOSAL. WILL INCREASE BASED NINE PER CAPITA AND MATCH FUNDING PAYMENTS TO LOCAL LIBRARIES PARTICIPATING IN THE PROGRAM. OKAY LA OF. WE HAVE FOUR CONCERNS WITH THIS PROPOSAL I WANTED TO WALK THROUGH EACH CONCERN YOUR HONOR THE FIRST CONCERN IS. THAT THE STATE ALREADY SPENDS BILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON EDUCATION AND ADULT EDUCATION THROUGH THINGS LIKE THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA. DON'T EDUCATION THROUGH. THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES APPORTIONMENT OF PORTION MINTS ADULT EDUCATION BLOCK GRANTS. SO WASN'T CLEAR TO US WANNA AN ADDITIONAL AUGMENTATION OF A FEW MILLION MORE DOLLARS WOULD HAVE OVERALL IN THE STATE'S I'M GIVEN THIS SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF SPENDING ALREADY. SECONDLY OTHER LOCAL LIBRARY PROGRAMS DON'T APPEAR TO BE NECESSARILY WELL COORDINATED WITH EXISTING STATE EFFORTS. FOR EXAMPLE EXISTING LAW ENCOURAGES LOCAL LIBRARIES TO A PARTICIPATING THE ADULT EDUCATION OUR CONSORTIA BUT DOES NOT REQUIRE THEM TO ANECDOTALLY REFER TO NEXT SOME SOME LIBRARIES DO PARTICIPATE SOME I DO NOT. I MEAN IT'S IT'S IT'S SOME WITH SOME THAT WE'VE HEARD SIMILAR THINGS ABOUT. THEIR INVOLVEMENT WITH LOCAL SCHOOLS. THIRD THE STATE ALSO LACKS A CLEAR GOALS ON ADULT LITERACY OVERALL IN STATE OF FOR ALL OF THESE PROGRAMS SO IT'S DIFFICULT TO ASSESS VIA. A WHAT MICHAEL'S THE WAY IT WENT WITH THE STATE'S A ACCOMPLISHING WITH THESE PROGRAMS ON HOW THE WEATHER NOT WE'RE ON TRACK TO ACCOMPLISH THESE GOALS. AND FINALLY THE STATE LACKS A CLEAR POLICY ON O. HOW SHARED OB PROGRAM COST BETWEEN THE STATE AND LOCAL FUNDING. THE RELEASE REASONS WE RECOMMEND YOU REJECT THE PROPOSAL. HOWEVER IF YOU IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO PROVIDE AN AUGMENTATION WE DO HAVE SOME SUGGESTIONS ON ON WAYS YOU COULD IMPROVE THE PROGRAM TO ENSURE ITS MEETING STATE PRIORITIES. THAT INCLUDES AYE RA REVISING LOTS REQUIRE LIBRARIES AS A CONDITION OF RECEIVING FUNDING. TO PARTICIPATE WITH A CLUB WHO OTHER LOCAL EDUCATION BUT A PROVIDERS OF PARTICIPATE IN THE ADULT EDUCATION CONSORTIA FOR EXAMPLE. WE ALSO RECOMMEND THAT YOU ESTABLISH AN ADULT LITERACY GOAL FOR THE STATE AND THEN OF REQUIRE PERIODIC REPORTING. TO ENSURE THAT A WERE MAKING PROGRESS TOWARDS ACHIEVING THAT OF ADULT LITERACY GOAL. THE FAMILY RECOMMEND THAT YOU HAVE A MORE FORMAL POLICY IN MIND BOUGHT SHARING OF COSTS BETWEEN STATE AND LOCAL FUNDING SO THAT YOU HAVE A BASIS TO. SORT OF THE TERM THAT EACH YEAR. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. STATE LIBRARY. WELL ALL OF THE SUGGESTIONS AT THE END OF JASON'S PRESENTATION. WHAT WOULD? CONCEPTUALLY MAKE A LOT OF SENSE RIGHT THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT STATE ENTITIES THAT. FOCUS ON IMPROVING LITERACY THERE'S A LOT OF NON PROFITS TO FOCUS ON THAT THERE'S ANY NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT ARE WORKING TOWARDS THE SAME GOAL. AND BETTER COORDINATION. WOULD BE A GOOD THING. THE TWO POINT FIVE MILLION HERE THIS IS A PROGRAM IS DANCE SAID THAT COMPLEMENTS SOME OF THE OTHER PROGRAMS THAT LIKE AN ADULT THAT WE'VE HAD THIS CONVERSATION AT PREVIOUS SUBCOMMITTEE HEARINGS. WHERE THE? THE. THE COURSE WORK THE CLASSES THE EDUCATION THAT HAPPENS AT A COMMUNITY COLLEGE LEVEL. OR AN ADULT EDUCATION IT YOU OFTEN NEED SOME BASIC. LEVEL OF LITERACY TO BENEFIT FROM AND THAT'S LARGELY THE SORT OF PEOPLE THAT ARE COMING INTO THIS LIBRARY PROGRAM PRIMARILY WOMEN. IN A PRIMARILY. LET LATINO WHO ARE WHO ARE LOOKING FOR A WAY TO. IMPROVE EITHER THEIR ECONOMIC CONDITION ARE PROVE THEIR ACADEMIC STANDING. WE ALSO FOUND THAT. INCLUDING FAMILIES IN LITERACY PROGRAMS IMPROVES THE. SUCCESS RATE OF THE ADULT LEARNERS THAT FOR ALL THE REASONS YOU WOULDN'T THINK OF. AND ALSO BY INVOLVING KIDS YOU CAN YOU HAVE A BETTER SHOT AT ENDING THE CYCLE OF THE LITERACY IN FAMILIES WITHOUT THE EXPENSE OF CATCHING SOMEBODY. YOU KNOW SORT OF THEM ADULTHOOD. AND AND YOU'RE LIKE YOU KNOW IF IF YOU STOOD ON MY SHOULDERS AS A STACK OF STUDIES THAT TALKS ABOUT HOW KIDS NOT READING AT A THIRD GRADE READING LEVEL BY THIRD GRADE. ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS TO THEIR LIFE PROJECTORS. OKAY THANK YOU I I KNOW WE'VE BEEN DISCUSSING THIS ISSUE FOR A FEW YEARS AND I'LL JUST NOTE THAT TIME. YET WE DO HAVE. THE LITERACY PROGRAMS AND. ADULT EDUCATION COMMUNITY COLLEGES. BUT. NOT ENOUGH AND SOME PEOPLE. DON'T LIKE TO GO THE DON'T EDUCATION THEY WANT TO GO THERE COMMITTEE CALLS PER SE BUT MAYBE THEY GO TO THE THOSE LOCAL LIBRARIAN SO. I THINK THAT UP MORE. VARIETY AND MORE OPTIONS IS IS A BETTER THING IN THIS FRONT SO I CERTAINLY SUPPORT. GET OUT THE STATE SPENDING MORE RESOURCES I I DO THINK THAT YOU THE LA OR DOES. I RAISE THEM. SOME GOOD QUESTIONS THAT MAYBE CAN LOOK AT THAT. COST SHARING MODELS AND INTENT AND TIE IN A MORE. BY UNIFIED STATEWIDE APPROACH WITH ALL OF OUR. EFFORTS FOCUSING ON THIS BUT HAVING THESE PROGRAMS ARE LEFT LOCAL LIBRARIES. I KNOW IT'S SOMETHING I SUPPORT MAKE SENSE OF SEEN HERE LOCALLY IN OUR IN OUR SACRAMENTO COMEDIAN OUR OUR LOCAL. LIBRARY DIRECTORS HERE TESTIFIED PUBLIC COMMENT AS WELL ABOUT THIS ISSUE. COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS BROTHER COMMITTEE MEMBERS MISTER CHAVIS. ARE YOU SURE THAT. COMMENTS STATED BY THE CHAIR. OF AND. YOU KNOW WE FORM THE CONSORTIUM'S TO DO ADULT LITERATURE ADULT LITERACY ALSO. IN THOSE ARE WORKING OUT REALLY WELL BUT WE'RE STILL NOT PROCESS BUT. NOT EVERYBODY'S GOING TO GO TO THOSE. ESPECIALLY START LOOK IN THE MORE RURAL AREAS IN ROLE LIBRARIES A PLANE. AND THE VOLUNTEERS IN INEQUALITY A COMMUNITY. SUPPORT YOU GET SO OBVIOUS SUPPORTIVE ALSO WHICH I THINK. A BROAD BRUSH TO REACH EVERYONE IS WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO. ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE. GREAT DIVERSITY WE'RE BRINGING WITHIN OUR STATE IS AN IMPORTANT THING TO CONTINUE TO INVEST AND SO ON THE SUPPORT OF THANK YOU. BUT AGAIN I'D BE HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOU ALL TO FIND WAYS WHERE ALL OF THE DIFFERENT ENTITIES THAT PARTICIPATE IN LITERACY. DO A BETTER JOB OF TALKING TO ONE ANOTHER AND FIGURING OUT HOW WE CAN. USE THE BOX THAT WE HAVE TO BETTER ADVANTAGE I MEAN NO HARM EVER COMES FROM PEOPLE TALKING TO ONE ANOTHER I AGREE THAT'S ONE OF THE DISCUSSION WE HAD YESTERDAY WITH THE REPUBLICANS ABOUT. HOW WE CAN? COMMUNICATE BETTER BUT WELL LIKE I SAY WHAT WHEN I'M HAPPY SO. TO WORK ON THAT WITH THE. OKAY. THANK YOU THING NO MORE QUESTIONS. ISSUE NUMBER BEHOLD THIS ISSUE UP ISSUE NUMBER SIX WORLD HISTORIES. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. INCLUDES AN AUGMENTATION OF TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS IN ONGOING FUNDING FOR THE ORAL HISTORY PROGRAM. THIS FUNDING WOULD ESTABLISH AN ADVISORY BOARD CHAIRED BY THE STATE ARCHIVIST DIGITALLY PRESERVE EXISTING ORAL HISTORIES. AND. CREATE NEW ORAL HISTORIES EACH YEAR. THE PROPOSAL BEFORE YOU APPEARS TO BE CONSISTENT WITH THE STATE LIBRARY'S MISSION OF PRESERVING CALIFORNIA HISTORY SO WE DON'T TAKE ISSUE WITH THAT WE RECOMMEND YOU ADOPT IT. WOULD YOU SUGGEST ONE A MODIFICATION THOUGH AND THAT IS THAT YOU CONSIDER MAKING IT LIMITED TERM RATHER THAN ON GOING MAKING IT LIMITED TERM WOULD ALLOW YOU TO REVISIT THIS PROGRAM IN A FEW YEARS. REVIEW WHAT WAS WHAT CAME ABOUT BECAUSE OF THE PROGRAM HOW MANY ORAL HISTORIES WERE DEVELOPED REVIEW THE COSTS AND THEN MAKE A BUDGET ADJUSTMENTS ACCORDINGLY BASED ON THOSE FINDINGS. THANK YOU. YOU'RE LEAVING IT OPEN RIGHT CHAIR WHAT I'M EXCITED ABOUT LEAVING IT OPEN. OKAY. YEAH THINKS I SHOULD RUB. YET NOT IT'S HARD TO CONTAIN MYSELF OKAY I I WILL NOT YEAR THAT. AND. THAT YEAH WE DO THIS. SUPPORT THIS HAPPEN YOU KNOW ANYWAY WE CAN DOCUMENT. HISTORY IS THERE'S I THINK CRITICAL AND AND I THINK YOU KNOW HERE. SOME OF THE. SOME ORAL HISTORIES OF A PEOPLE LIKE OUR CURRENT GOVERNOR FORMER SPEAKER WILLIE BROWN. AND SOME OF OUR LEGENDS ARE GONNA BE AROUND FOREVER. AND SO ON ONE THING THAT I WANTED TO ADD ON TO ITS THE WORKLOAD. IS TAKING A LOOK AT THE LEGISLATURE. AYE WE HAVE FOR EXAMPLE SOME OF OUR ACT CAUCUSES SOME OF OUR ETHNIC CAUCUS IS THE WOMAN'S* IS TO KNOW THAT. ROLL CAUCUS WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN AROUND FOR DECADES AND IT'S ALWAYS INTRIGUING TO TO DOCUMENT THAT FOR EXAMPLE WE HAD THE FIFTIETH ANNIVERSARY LAST YEAR. OF THE CURRENT BLACK OBSERVE CAUCUS I THINK THAT. THE LATINO THAT WOULD SAVE CAUCUSES COMING UP ON A ON A LANDMARK ANNIVERSARIES WELL. AND SO WE WANT TO ASK THAT YOU CONSIDER THAT WHILE WE WILL LIKELY PUT ADDITIONAL MONEY INTO THIS PROPOSAL. AND THAT WORK ON A WORK PLAN TO LOOK AT THOSE ISSUES AS WELL. WHAT I THINK THAT'S A TERRIFIC STORY TO TELL? TRIPLET BUT I'D BE VERY HAPPY TO HELP WITH THAT. IN ENOUGH I MADE THE THIS WOULD OFFICE IT WOULD BE NICE TO LOOK AT. OF THE DIVERSITY THE* IS IN A* IS SO WILLING TO LET. OTHER. BIPARTISAN PEOPLE BE A PART OF THE ONE OF MY PERSONAL ISSUES AS BEING A LATINO HERE FOR SIX YEARS. NEVER BEING ALLOWED TO BE PART OF THE LATINO CAUCUS I THINK WE DO HISTORY WE NEED TO DO THE FULL SWEEP OF WHAT THE HISTORY IS OF THESE CAUCUSES. APPOINT ALL SET. IF THREE IS NOT ALWAYS PERFECT AND PRETTY MISTER THAT IS NOT ENOUGH THROUGH. SO MISTER CHAIR YEAH MISTER O'DONNELL WE'RE GONNA SPEND A BUNCH OF MONEY TELLING PEOPLE HOW GREAT WE ARE. IS REALLY A WISE USE OF TAXPAYER MONEY. I JUST BAFFLES ME AT WHAT WHAT SPECIFIC ACT ARE YOU REFERENCING MISTER O'DONNELL. OR INTERPERSONAL LAWLER AND AND THE ADULT I GUESS THE HOPE PROPOSAL AS IT SPEAKS TO THE LEGISLATURE I JUST THINK. HI I JUST I'M CURIOUS AS TO WHETHER OR NOT THAT'S A WISE EXPENDITURE. THERE ENOUGH. OKAY WILL HOLD THIS ISSUE OPEN. AND WE WILL MOVE ON TO. ISSUE NUMBER WILL SKIP TO ISSUE NUMBER TWO. SKIP IS NUMBER ONE. THIS IS A CROSS CUTTING ISSUE WITH YOU SEE CSU AND TOO MANY COLLEGES LAST YEAR WE HAD. A DISCUSSION ABOUT. HUNGER AND THE. PROBLEM WE SEE AT MANY OF OUR CAMPUSES WITH. STUDENTS HAVING A TOUGH TIME. THANK FOR THE BASICS INCLUDING FOOD AND WE PUTS IN THE BUDGET SOME RESOURCES TO DEAL WITH STUDENT HUNGER WHAT TO. HAVE AN UPDATE ON THAT HOW THAT'S GOING. TO TALK ABOUT THE ISSUE AS WELL. THANK YOU CHAIR MCCARTY MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR INVITING US TO SHARE SOME BRIEF COMMENTS TODAY. MY NAME IS TINGLE ARE NO. AND I'M FROM UC SANTA CRUZ WITH ME IS REMAIN KANETO FROM UC BERKELEY. WE CO CHAIR THE YOU SEE GLOBAL FOOD INITIATIVES FOOD ACCESS TO BASIC NEEDS EFFORT. SO IN THIS ROLE FOR THE LAST FOUR YEARS WE'VE COORDINATED EFFORTS ON BEHALF OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA'S OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT AND TEN CAMPUSES. ESTABLISHING EFFECTIVE SYSTEM WIDE IN CAMPUS LEVEL PROGRAMMING RESEARCH AND EVALUATION. MEASURES TO ADVANCE INSTITUTIONALIZING BEST PRACTICES GOING FORWARD. THROUGH THE GLOBAL FOOD INITIATIVE COUPLED WITH THIS YEAR WITH LEGISLATIVE SUPPORT THROUGH HUNGER FREE CAMPUS FUNDING. OUR EFFORTS HAVE INCLUDED LAUNCHING IN SCALING UP NUTRITIOUS AND CHOICE BASED FOOD PANTRIES ON ALL CAMPUSES. INCREASING ACCESS TO FOOD PROVISIONING OF PREPARATION WORKSHOPS AND SERVICES. SPENDING SWIPE ON HUNGER PROGRAMS THAT ALLOW YOU SEE STUDENTS TO DONATE EXCESS MEAL PLAN DOLLARS TO STUDENTS IN NEED ON ALL CAMPUSES. IN ESTABLISHING COLLABORATIONS WITH STATING COUNTY OFFICES TO REGISTER STUDENTS FOR CAL FRESH THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA'S NUTRITION ASSISTANCE PROGRAM. AS WORK ON FOOD INSECURITY HAS PROGRESSED IT BECAME CLEAR THAT FOOD INSECURITY IS JUST ONE ELEMENT UNDER A BROADER A BROTHER. OF BASIC NEEDS THAT TAKES INTO ACCOUNT THE UNIQUE HARDSHIPS PRESENTED BY THE OVERALL COST OF ATTENDANCE FOR STUDENTS INCLUDING FOOD. HOUSING AND WELLNESS RELATED EXPENSES AND DECEMBER TWENTY SEVENTEEN WE PUBLISH OUR LARGEST STUDY TO DATE THAT YOU SEE STUDENT FOOD HOUSING SECURITY STUDY ARE MAJOR LESSONS LEARNED FROM OVER SIXTY THOUSAND UNDERGRADUATE. AND SIX THOUSAND GRADUATE STUDENT PARTICIPANTS PERTAIN TO OUR HUNGER FREE CAMPUS EFFORTS AS FOLLOWS. AT PRESENT WE ARE ADDRESSING THE GENERAL UNDERGRADUATE STUDENT POPULATION FACING FORTY FOUR PERCENT COMBINED LOW IN VERY LOW FOOD SECURITY LEVELS. BY UTILIZING A MULTI FACTOR ANALYSIS THAT DETERMINES THE MOST AT RISK GROUPS AND PRIORITIZING SUPPORT STRATEGIES FOR THEM. TWENTY FIVE TWENTY SIX PERCENT OF GRADUATE STUDENTS EXPANDS FOOD INSECURITY DURING THE ACADEMIC YEAR WE HAVE DEVELOPED BETTER GUIDANCE SYSTEMS FOR CAL FRESH BENEFIT ENROLLMENT QUALIFICATION FOR GRADUATE STUDENTS AS WELL AS UTILIZE MOTIVE. FACTOR ANALYSIS TO IDENTIFY THE GREATER AT RISK GROUPS. ADDRESSING BASIC NEEDS AS A NOTABLE EFFECT ON ACADEMIC SUCCESS AND ACHIEVEMENT DATA FROM ANALYSIS INDICATES THE MAJORITY OF UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS EXPERIENCING BOTH FOOD INSECURITY IN HOMELESSNESS WERE BELOW THAT THREE POINT OH GPA WHICH HAS A DIRECT IMPACT ON THEIR ON AND OFF CAMPUS. STUDENT EMPLOYABILITY ACCESS TO RESEARCH PROGRAMS AND POST GRADUATION OPPORTUNITIES. ONLY SEVENTY PERCENT OF GRADUATE STUDENTS WERE EXPERIENCE FOURTEEN SECURITY AND HOMELESS THAT'S REPORT BEING ON TRACK TO COMPLETE THEIR DEGREE ON TIME. COMPARED TO EIGHTY TWO PERCENT OF STUDENTS WHO ARE BOTH FOOD AND HOUSING SECURE. WE CONTINUE TO MATCH OUR RESEARCH WITH APPLY PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION IN STUDENT SUPPORT SERVICES ARE NOT PASSIVE BACK TO TIM TO SHARE ABOUT A HUNGER FOR CAMPUS IMPACTS AND UPDATES. SO PUBLIC CONFIRMATION OF THE TWO POINT FIVE MILLION IN THE CURRENT YEAR BUDGET FOR THE UC SYSTEM EACH CAMPUS WAS AWARDED THE QUALIFICATIONS OF TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND. WE SHARED MEASURE BONE REPORTABLE OUTCOMES ASSOCIATED WITH A BEFORE FIFTY THREES FUNDING FOCUS. AT EACH CAMPUS FUNDING WAS DIRECTED AT FOUR SPECIFIC AREAS. EMERGENCY MEALS CAL FRESH OUT REACHING ENROLLMENT INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAM STAFFING SUPPORT. SO THEN EMERGENCY MEALS HUNGER FREE CAMPUS FUNDING IS SUPPORTED STUDENTS WITH THE LARGEST PERSONAL POLICY INSTITUTIONAL BARRIERS TO SUSTAIN THEIR BASIC NEEDS. SUPPORT INCLUDES INVESTING OVER FORTY THOUSAND DINING MEAL VOUCHERS ARE SWIPES. AS WELL AS INCREASED SOURCING OF FRESH HEALTHY AND DIVERSE FOOD OFFERINGS FOR PANTRY AND DISTRIBUTION FOOD SERVICES. SERVING OVER FOURTEEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED UNIQUE STUDENTS OVER THE LAST FOUR MONTHS ALONE ACROSS ALL TEN CAMPUSES. STUDENT HEALTH FRESH WORK HAS INCLUDED WORKING IN CONCERT WITH CDSS AS CALPERS PROGRAM LEADS AS WELL AS OUR PARTNERS IN THE CSU NCCC. TO INCLUDE CAL FRESH UNDERGRADUATE AND GRADUATE STUDENT AWARENESS APPLICATION ASSISTANCE AND SUCCESSFUL ENROLLMENT BENEFITS TO DATE THIS YEAR YOU SEE CAMPUSES HAVE ENROLLED A RENEWED OVER EIGHT THOUSAND STUDENTS IN CALIFORNIA. DRAWING IN OVER TEN MILLION AND FEDERAL FUNDS ADMINISTERED THROUGH THE STATE TOWARD CAMPUS COMMUNITIES. WITH RESPECT INFRASTRUCTURE CAMPUSES HAVE INCLUDED SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT IN ORDER TO IMPROVE FIND PANTRY FOOD AVAILABILITY. INVESTMENTS IN CARTS AS WELL AS FOOD PROVISIONING IN TRANSPORTATION SERVICES. ALL TEN CAMPUSES HAVE ESTABLISHED A FRESH AND HEALTHY CHOICE BASED PANTRY THAT INCLUDE SUPPLEMENTAL EVENT SITE BASED FOOD DISTRIBUTION. WITH PROGRAM STAFFING SUPPORT PART TIME SUPPORT IN THE FORM OF STUFF PETE STUDENT INTERNS AS WELL AS GRADUATE STUDENT RESEARCH APPOINTMENTS WERE INCLUDED TO DIRECTLY SUPPORT PROGRAM OUTCOMES. OF THE HUNDRED FREE CAMPUS AB FOR FIFTY THREE FUNDING. IN ADDITION YOU SEE HAS PROVIDED I'M GOING SYSTEM I COORDINATION OF HIS EFFORTS COUPLED WITH IN PERSON CONVENING AN ONLINE MONTHLY MEETING SUPPORT. AND SUPPLEMENTAL CAMPUS LEVEL STOP TIME DEDICATED TO THE SUCCESS OF A BEFORE FIFTY THREE OUTCOMES. HUNGER FOR CAMPUS FUNDING WAS ESSENTIAL THE SEVENTEEN AND EIGHTEEN ACADEMIC YEAR. ALL OF OUR COURT ALL OF OUR CAMPUSES HAVE CONFIRMED THAT THE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND AWARDED BY YOU OUR STATE LEADERSHIP HAS BEEN ASCENSION CONTRIBUTING TOWARD PROVIDING THE GROWING NEED OF SERVICES FOR STUDENTS. THE LESSONS LEARNED THAT ON AND OFF CAMPUS RELATIONSHIP STRENGTHENED AND THE IMPROVE INFRASTRUCTURE WILL PROVIDE EVEN MORE EXPENSIVE STUDENT IMPACT WITH YOUR CONTINUED FUNDING. PERVASIVE LEVELS OF FOOD INSECURITY AND HOMELESS AS AT CCC UC AND CSU SYSTEMS SPEAKS TO A STATEWIDE NEED FOR INCREASED STUDENT SUPPORT FOR BASIC NEEDS. WE LOOK FORWARD TO THE FUTURE POSSIBILITY OF LEVERAGING FURTHER FUNDING THAT IS ADDITIONAL TO OUR EDUCATION FUNDING YOUR ADDITIONAL FUNDING WILL ENSURE THAT EACH CAMPUS ACCOMPLISHES THE FOR FOLLOWING. NUMBER ONE HAS A SAFE AN ATTRITION SPACE THAT WILL KEEP A STUDENT FROM GOING WITHOUT FOOD. TO SCALE CAO FRESH EFFORTS TO EDUCATE AND ROLL THOUSANDS OF STUDENTS PER CAMPUS. OPERATE FACILITIES WERE STUDENTS WILL FEEL THEY BELONG AND ARE BEING SEARCHED PRO ACTIVELY AND EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT MANNER FURTHERING THE POTENTIAL FOR ACADEMIC SUCCESS AND RETAIN STUDENT AND PROFESSIONAL STAFF THAT ARE RESPONSIBLE TO CARRY OUT THESE COMMITMENTS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND ONGOING COMMITMENT TO COLLEGE STUDENT BASIC NEEDS. OKAY. IF YOU. GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS. DENISE BADLY AND I'M THE DIRECTOR OF STUDENT WELLNESS AND BASIC NEEDS INITIATIVE FOR THE CSU AND TO START I WOULD LIKE TO THANK. ALL OF YOU. AND YOUR LEGISLATIVE COLLEAGUES FOR YOUR SUPPORT OF OUR EFFORTS TO MEET THE BASIC NEEDS OF OUR STUDENTS. THE TWO POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS ALLOCATED. BY THE BUDGET ACT OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN TO THE CSU HAS BEEN DISPERSED ALL TWENTY THREE CAMPUSES. TO HELP THEM BECOME DESIGNATED AS HUNGER FREE THESE FUNDS WILL BE CRITICAL IN HELPING ARTS CAMPUSES DEVELOP IMPLMENT AND ENHANCE RESOURCES RELATED TO FOOD INSECURITY. AND ALSO HOUSING DISPLACEMENT FORA ALLOCATION WE. WE DAY ARE IF PEOPLE ASK US FOR THAT. AYE AND HAD CAMPUSES TO SUBMIT PROPOSALS FOR FUNDING FOR GREATER ACCOUNTABILITY AND THOUGHTFUL IMPLEMENTATION AND EVALUATION. THE SERGEANT DISTRIBUTED THIS HAND OUT HERE. AT ALL REFER TO IT THROUGHOUT MY PRESENT A THROUGHOUT MY COMMENTS. SQUEEZING. SIDE ONE TO PIXAR COMMITMENT TO THE SEAT TO CSU STUDENTS AND THEIR ACADEMIC AND FUTURE SUCCESS. IT NECESSITATES A COMMITMENT TO SUPPORTING THEIR BASIC NEEDS ONCE STUDENTS BASIC NEEDS ARE NOT ADDRESS IT CAN HAVE AN IMPACT ON BOTH A PERSONAL AND ACADEMIC GROWTH IMPEDING THEIR ABILITY TO ACHIEVE THEIR GOALS AND EARNED A DEGREE. THIS IS WHY STUDENT WHILE BEING AS A PRIORITY IN OUR GRADUATION TWENTY. TWENTY TWENTY FIVE INITIATIVE THE CS USE PLAN TO ENSURE THAT ALL STUDENTS HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN GRADUATE IN A TIMELY MANNER. POSITIVELY IMPACTING THEIR FUTURE IN PRODUCING ADDITIONAL GRADUATES TO POWER CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY AND INNOVATION. TURNING TO FLY TO THE CS USE BASIC NEEDS INITIATIVE THAT THE SYSTEM WIDE EFFORT TO COORDINATE SERVICES AROUND CAMPUSES. SKINNER. HELPING THEM REACH ALL STUDENTS IN NEED OF SUPPORT. INITIATIVE IS STRUCTURED AROUND FIVE KEY AREAS ADDRESSING THE IMMEDIATE NEEDS OF STUDENTS. GROWING CAMPUS BASS BAIT. CAMPUS BASED BASIC NEEDS SERVICES SO THEY CAN REACH ADDITIONAL STUDENTS SCALING BEST PRACTICES FROM ONE CAMPUS TO ANOTHER. WORKING WITH PARTNERS AND ENSURING LONG TERM SUSTAINABILITY OF BASIC NEEDS SERVICES. AND FEBRUARY WE RELEASE OUR FAITH TO COMPREHENSIVE RESEARCH STUDY OF BASIC NEEDS IN THE CSU. WE ALSO HAD A SYSTEM WIDE BASIC NEEDS INITIATIVE CONFERENCE WHICH BROUGHT TOGETHER CLOSE TO THREE HUNDRED ATTENDEES TO SHARE BEST PRACTICES PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES TO LEARN FROM NATIONAL EXPERTS. AND DEVELOP ACTION PLANS FOR FURTHER PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT TO ADDRESS STUDENT BASIC MEANS. ASSEMBLY WOMAN WEBER PROVIDE A POWERFUL INSPIRING WORDS CHALLENGING US TO CONTINUE WORKING TOWARDS ERADICATING STUDENT HOME HUNGER AND HOMELESSNESS IN CALIFORNIA. AND THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. SEE WHAT CSU CAMPUSES HAVE BEEN HARD AT WORK MAKING STUDENTS TO RESOURCES SERVICES AND PROGRAMS THAT ADDRESS FOOD INSECURITY HOUSING DISPLACEMENT HOMELESSNESS AND FINANCIAL CRISIS. ON FLIGHT THREE FOR STUDENTS STRUGGLING WITH FOOD INSECURITY ALL TWENTY THREE OF OUR CAMPUSES HAVE A FOOD PANTRY OR FOOD DISTRIBUTION PROGRAM. ALL CAMPUSES PROVIDE CAL FRESH APPLICATION ASSISTANCE TO ELIGIBLE STUDENTS SO THEY MIGHT HAVE HEALTHY EATING OPTIONS AND A MAJORITY OF CAMPUSES OFFER MEALS TO THE MEAL THROUGH EMAIL SHARING PROGRAM ARE MIL ABOUT TRICKS PROGRAM. ON SLIDE FOR YOU'LL SEE THAT CSU CAMPUSES ALSO PROVIDE STUDENTS WITH SHORT TERM EMERGENCY HOUSING MORE THAN TWO THIRDS OF OUR CAMPUSES OFFER ON CAMPUS EMERGENCY HOUSING OR VOUCHERS FOR OFF CAMPUS HOUSING. FOR EXAMPLE AT CSU CHICO STOP PROVIDE STUDENTS FACING. AND EMERGE I'M FACING. CRISIS EMERGENCY HOUSING HOTEL VOUCHERS TO PROVIDE SHORT TERM RELIEF. AND THE CAMPUS WILL SERVE AS A CO SIGNER ON LEASE AGREEMENTS. TO HELP STUDENTS TRANSITION INTO LONG TERM HOUSING. SIMILARLY CSU NORTHRIDGE WILL PROVIDE FUNDING FOR SECURITY DEPOSITS TO HELP STUDENTS IN NEED OF TO PROCURE HOUSING. AND ON FLIGHT FIVE CSU CAMPUSES ALSO PROVIDE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO STUDENTS IN NEED MORE THAN EIGHTY PERCENT OF CSU STUDENTS RECEIVE SOME FORM OF NON LOAN AID. BUT BEYOND FEDERAL STATE AND INSTRUCTIONAL FINANCIAL AID PROGRAMS THE MAJORITY OF OUR CAMPUSES ALSO OFFER EMERGENCY GRANTS ARE FUNDS FOR EXAMPLE SAN JOSE STATE OFFERS EMERGENCY GRANTS FOR STUDENTS. I DIED THAT THEY ARE NOT REQUIRED TO REPAY. SACRAMENTO STATE ALSO OFFERS EMERGENCY GRANTS IN HOWTH WHO FINANCIAL LITERACY WORKSHOPS TO TEACH STUDENTS ABOUT MONEY MANAGEMENT AND BUDGETING. ON THE FINAL SLIDE WE ARE PROUD OF THE VISION OUR CAMPUSES THAT TAKEN TO ADDRESS THESE CONCERNS HEAD ON AND CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THEIR EFFORTS FROM THE CHANCES OFFICE. WE ALSO KNOW THAT THERE IS MUCH MORE TO BE DONE AND LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH OUR LOCAL STATE AND FEDERAL LEGISLATIVE ALLIES. TO HELP US ENSURE THAT ALL STUDENTS ARE ABLE TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE SUCCESSFUL THANK YOU. THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN MCCARTY AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY AND THANK YOU FOR THE SUPPORT. OF BASIC NEEDS FOR THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS MY NAME IS COLLEEN GANLEY AND I'M A PROGRAM SPECIALIST WITH THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE. MY WORK FOCUSES ON SUPPORTING THE BASIC NEEDS OF COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS INCLUDING FOOD HOUSING HEALTH AND MENTAL HEALTH CARE SERVICES ARE SYSTEM CURRENTLY HAS APPROXIMATELY TWO POINT ONE. TWO POINT ONE MILLION STUDENTS. WE ARE SO PLEASED TO HAVE JUST HOSTED OUR FIRST EVER CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE BASIC NEEDS SUMMIT WE HAD CLOSE TO THREE HUNDRED FACULTY STAFF AND ADMINISTRATORS ATTEND THE SUMMIT. TO LEARN ABOUT STRATEGIES AND BEST PRACTICES IN SUPPORT OF THEIR STUDENTS BASIC NEEDS WITH THE LONG TERM GOAL OF INSTITUTIONALIZING THESE BEST PRACTICES. WERE HOPING TO MAKE THIS AN ANNUAL OR BIANNUAL EVENTS. IN PREPARATION FOR IMPLEMENTING THE HUNGER FREE CAMPUS CAMPAIGN WITHIN OUR SYSTEM THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE CONDUCTED A SYSTEM WIDE SURVEY REGARDING FOOD SECURITY RESOURCES. AVAILABLE TO STUDENTS NINETY TWO PERCENT OF THE COLLEGES HUNDRED AND FIVE OF OUR HUNDRED FOURTEEN COLLEGES RESPONDED. SIXTY EIGHT POINT FOUR PERCENT REPORTED CAMPUS BASED FOOD PANTRIES ALMOST FORTY EIGHT PERCENT REPORTED COLLABORATION WITH THE LOCAL FOOD BANKS TO ACCESS LOW IN NO COST FOODS. STOCK THEIR FOOD PANTRIES AND ALMOST SIXTY TWO PERCENT REPORTED PROVIDING CAL FRESH APPLICATION ASSISTANCE TO THEIR STUDENTS. USING THE SURVEY DATA WE DEVELOPED A BEST PRACTICES GUIDE WHICH IS GOING TO BE DISTRIBUTED ACROSS OUR SYSTEM THIS WEEK I PROVIDED A COPY FOR YOU ALL AND WE CAN ALSO MAKE THAT AVAILABLE ELECTRONICALLY. OF THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE UTILIZED EXISTING APPORTIONMENT PROCESS HE'S TO DISTRIBUTE OUR HUNGER CREEK HUNGER FREE CAMPUS FUNDS TO ALL SEVENTY TWO DISTRICTS. THAT COVER A HUNDRED FOURTEEN COMMUNITY COLLEGES ACROSS THE STATE. THE ALLOCATION ENABLE THE MULTITUDE OF FOOD SECURITY RELATED ACTIVITIES ACROSS OUR SYSTEM INCLUDING PROVIDING CAL FRESHEN ROMAN INFORMATION AND ROOM ROLE MEANT SUPPORT SERVICES TO STUDENTS. EXPANDING CAMPUS BASED FOOD PANTRIES AND REGULAR FOOD DISTRIBUTION ON OUR CAMPUSES ESTABLISHING HOT MEAL VOUCHER PROGRAMS DEVELOPING MEAL DONATION GIFT BACK PROGRAMS PROVIDING FINANCIAL LITERACY TO OUR STUDENTS. CREATING FARMER MARKET DONATION PROGRAMS AND AND A FEW SITES ESTABLISHING COMMUNITY GARDEN PROGRAMS. IN ORDER TO SUPPORT THE COLLEGES FOR IMPLEMENTING THE HUNGER FREE CAMPUS CAMPAIGN WE PARTNERED WITH OUR CSU PARTNERS AND HOSTED ELEVEN REGIONAL TRAINING. FOCUSED ON CALPERS ENROLLMENT PROCESS THERE WAS EXTENSIVE INTEREST ACROSS OUR SYSTEM WE HAD EIGHTY TWO COLLEGES SEND. OVER FIVE HUNDRED COMMUNITY COLLEGE FACULTY AND STAFF THAT RECEIVED A DAYLONG TRAINING ABOUT HOW TO SUPPORT THEIR STUDENTS AND ROLLING CAO FRESH. WE'VE BEEN WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF FOOD BANKS TO HELP COLLEGES CREATE RELATIONSHIPS WITH THEIR LOCAL FOOD BANKS. AND WITH THEIR COUNTY CAL FRESH STAFF AND WE'RE DOING THIS COLLEGE BY COLLEGE REGION BY REGION. IT IS JUST CRITICAL FOR. FOLKS IN OUR SYSTEM TO LEVERAGE EXISTING EXTERNAL RELATIONSHIPS WITH FOOD BANKS AND WITH COUNTY CAL FRESH STAFF. TO KEEP THIS GOING A MOVING FORWARD WE HOPE TO EXPAND. OUTREACH RESOURCE SURFEIT APPS SORRY OUT REACH RESOURCES FOR THE COLLEGES INCLUDING PARTICIPATING IN AND SUPPORTING THE DEVELOPMENT OF VIRTUAL CAO FRESHEN ROMAN TRAININGS THAT ARE BEING DEVELOPED BY THE CSU SYSTEM. A WE HOPE TO PARTICIPATE AND ALSO PROVIDE SOME INTERNAL FUNDING FOR SPONSORSHIP FOR THAT PROJECT. THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT EFFORTS TO CREATE LONG TERM INFRASTRUCTURE TO SUPPORT THE FOOD SECURITY NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS THE ONETIME HUNGER FREE CAMPUS ALLOCATIONS PROVIDED. HAS ALLOWED THE COLLEGES TO INVEST IN ITEMS NEEDED TO OFFER FOOD PANTRY SERVICES RECEIVED HOW FRESHEN ROMAN TRAINING AND DEVELOP RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE LOCAL FOOD BANKS AND COUNTY CAL FRESH STAFF. WE ARE ENCOURAGING AND SUPPORTING THE COLLEGES TO BEGIN INSTITUTIONALIZING THESE EFFORTS. THANK YOU AND I'M OPEN TO ANY QUESTIONS YOU HAVE. OKAY. THANK YOU. ASSEMBLYMEMBER LEE MONTH THANK YOU THIS ERA HAS BEEN. SOMETHING THAT I HAVE HAD A LOT OF INTEREST IN. LAST YEAR WE WERE ABLE TO RUN A BILL AND WE GOT FUNDING FOR THIS I'M JUST LAST WEEK I WAS AT THE CSU CHANNEL ISLANDS CAMPUS. A TALKING TO STUDENTS AND THIS IS CLEARLY STILL AN ISSUE. AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WAS MENTIONED IN THE COMMENTS WAS THAT THERE WAS. AND INTEND TO INSTITUTIONALIZE BEST PRACTICES. WHAT FROM BOTH A THING FOR ALL THREE ENTITIES WHAT WHAT CAN WE EXPECT THAT TO LOOK LIKE IN THE FUTURE AS IF THIS PROBLEM CONTINUES TO GROW AS THAT THAT IS THAT? THE PROBLEM OF BASIC NEEDS FOR STUDENT CONTINUES TO GROW WHICH AS YOU'VE ALL STATED HAS AN IMPACT ON ACADEMIC OUTCOMES. WELL I AYE WHICH IS SAY THAT FOR OUR COLLEGES YOU KNOW WE HAVE A HUNDRED FOURTEEN COLLEGES AND TWO POINT ONE MILLION STUDENTS. I THINK THAT IT IS CRITICAL THAT WE HELP OUR COLLEGES GET CONNECTED WITH THEIR LOCAL RESOURCES BECAUSE THAT IS SUSTAINABLE AND THAT MEANS CREATING MO USE WITH THE COUNTY. FOOD BANKS THAT INCLUDES ESTABLISHING RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE CAL FRESH OUT REACH FOLKS THERE IN THOSE FOOD BANKS AND AT THE COUNTIES. OF OUR SYSTEM IT IS GOVERNED ON IN PART BY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WHICH MEANS DECISIONS HAPPEN LOCALLY ABOUT WHAT RESOURCES THEY HAVE ON CAMPUS AND WHAT RESOURCES. ARE LOCATED IN THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITIES WE DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE FULL JURISDICTION TO. TO MAKE THEM DO THAT BUT THE COLLEGES HAVE SHOWN. EXTREME WILLINGNESS TO PARTNER WITH THOSE EXTERNAL ENTITIES AND TO TO CREATE PROCESS HE'S AS PART OF THEIR FINANCIAL AID PROCESS AS PART OF THE ENROLLMENT PROCESS. AND SO FOR US THAT'S WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE IN TERMS OF INSTITUTIONALIZING THE WORK. FIGHT I CAN'T SAY THAT IT WILL HAPPEN AT A HUNDRED AND FOURTEEN COLLEGES BUT WE CERTAINLY HAVE HEARD FROM MANY MANY FOLKS. WHO HAVE EXPRESSED INTEREST IN THAT AND THEN ALSO LOOKING AT YOU KNOW THE RESOURCES THAT THEY HAVE A CAMPUS AND? PRIORITIZING THE BASIC NEEDS FOR THEIR STUDENTS. I THINK I HAVE IF I COULD OFFER US ON AND THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR OTHER LEADERSHIP IN THE QUALITY TIME THAT YOU HAD IN THIS CONVERSATION. ARE ON SITES AND AND AND HERE IN THE CAPITAL. I THINK ONE OF THE CONVERSATIONS THAT WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH IS THE FACT THAT THIS PROBLEM ISN'T GOING TO GO ANYWHERE AND IT'S AND ONLY GONNA GET WORSE WITH THE INCREASED COST OF LIVING IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND THE FACT THAT FUTURE GENERATIONS OF STUDENTS CANNOT CONTINUE TO COME INTO EITHER THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM THE CSU SYSTEM ARE THE UC SYSTEM OR THE PRIVATE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM. WITHOUT BEING INTRODUCED AND TRAINED AND PREPARED FOR THE BASIC NEEDS EXPERIENCE OF THE COLLEGE EXPERIENCE. TOO MANY STUDENTS RIGHT NOW CALIFORNIA HAVE NEVER SEEN A FINANCIAL AID PACKAGE UNTIL THEY GET THEIR FINANCIAL AID PACKAGE WHEN THE GET INTO COLLEGE. ODD TOO MANY STUDENTS RIGHT NOW HAVE NEVER HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO THINK THROUGH HOW DO I CREATE MY BUDGET AS A COLLEGE STUDENT. IF I GET FINANCIAL AID WHAT IS THAT LOOK LIKE IF I DON'T GET FINANCIAL AID WHAT DOES THAT LOOK LIKE AND THEN IN THE COLLEGES THAT I'M APPLYING FOR WHICH THE COST OF LIVING IN THAT AREA AND HOW DO I COME PREPARED. TO BE IN THAT AREA AND THE WAY THAT I CAN TAKE CARE OF MY BASIC NEEDS. YES CAL FRESH IS A HUGE ONE RIGHT NOW BECAUSE HISTORICALLY COLLEGE STUDENTS HAVE BEEN BEEN ACTIVATED FOR THE CALIFORNIA CONVERSATION AND CAL FRESH IS SOMETHING THAT ALL THREE SYSTEMS ARE PRIORITIZING. BECAUSE THE SIZE OF MOST SUSTAINABLE WAY OF MAKING SURE THAT STUDENTS HAVE THE RESOURCES TO BUY GROCERIES TO TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES. BUT. PART OF THAT CONVERSATION CAN HAPPEN. ONCE THEY'RE IN COLLEGE. ALL OF THESE BASIC NEEDS STRATEGY SHOULD BE TRAINED IN SHOULD BE INTRODUCED TO STUDENTS BEFORE THEY GET HERE. SO IN OUR PRESENTATION TO THE CALIFORNIA STUDENT AID COMMISSION WE ALSO BROUGHT THAT THERE BECAUSE THE STATE IS FINDING SEVERAL PRE COLLEGE. I HAVE PRE COLLEGE PROGRAMS BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE PRE COLLEGE PROGRAMS THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT WHAT IS SEE SEE SEE WHAT IS THE ISSUE WHAT IS YOU SEE WHAT ARE THEIR REQUIREMENTS. AND THEN HOW DO YOU MAKE HOW DO YOU SUBMIT A COMPETITOR APPLICATION. AND THAT'S FAR AS WE GOT. BUT WE DON'T TALK ABOUT WHAT ITS FINANCIAL AID WATER COLLEGE FINANCES HOW RIGHT TAKE CARE OF MYSELF ONCE I GET TO COLLEGE CITING INSTITUTIONALIZING IS WHAT ARE THE DIRECT SERVICES THAT WE'RE GOING TO PROVIDE WITHIN THE UNIVERSITY. AND ADVOCATING FOR BASIC NEEDS TO BE PRIORITIZED WITHIN THE UNIVERSITY WITHIN OUR STATE BUDGET BUT THEN ALSO UNDERSTANDING THAT THERE IS A PRE COLLEGE COMPONENT TO THAT THAT IS ESSENTIAL. BECAUSE WE SHOULDN'T BE HAVING TO. GOAL RECRUIT STUDENTS TO TRY TO COME TO BASIC NEEDS INTERVENTIONS THAT WE'RE DESIGNING DATIA COMING KNOWING THAT A SUCCESSFUL STUDENT. PRIORITIZE OF THEIR BASIC NEEDS AND THAT AND THIS IS HOW YOU DO IT CITING THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'RE REALLY EXCITED FOR BECAUSE THAT PRE COLLEGE COMPONENT. SERVES ALL THREE OF OUR SYSTEMS A BETTER PREPARED STUDENT GOING INTO THE CCC CSU YOU SEE TAKES CARE OF THEIR BASIC NEEDS. AND I'LLJUST PIGGYBACK OPT OUT ANOTHER. PEACE THAT WE'RE REALLY TRYING TO STRESS ARE AROUND INSTITUTIONALIZING EFFORT THAT INFRASTRUCTURE CAN SO YOU CAN HAVE PROGRAMS AND SERVICES BUT YOU HAVE TO HAVE PEOPLE ON CAMPUS WHO CAN RUN THOSE SERVICES AND PROGRAMS AND. MANY TIMES THE FOLKS ON OUR CAMPUSES ARE WEARING MANY HATS AND THIS IS THAT ADDITIONAL HAT SO HOW DO WE START TO THINK ABOUT WAYS THAT WE CAN HAVE FOLKS IN. THOSE PROGRAMS AND SERVICES THAT ARE FOCUSED ON BASIC NEEDS. AND YOU KNOW WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT STUDENT SUCCESS YOU KNOW YOU MAY HEAR THE TERM ALL WILL YOU KNOW EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS ARE NOT SOCIAL SERVICE. AGENCIES BUT WE ARE STUDENT SUCCESS AGENCIES WE ARE PROMOTING STUDENT SUCCESS WERE TRYING TO GET STUDENTS TO STAY IN SCHOOL TO GRADUATE AND THEN GOING TO THE WORKFORCE AND BE PRODUCTIVE. SO I THINK AS WE START TO THINK ABOUT THIS WHOLE LISTA COOLEY AND THINKING ABOUT ALL THE DIFFERENT VARIABLES THAT PLAY INTO A STUDENT SUCCESS WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT WHILE THAT'S WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT HEALTH AND WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT BASIC NEEDS. AT FOUNDATIONS FOR LEARNING AND FOUNDATIONS FOR STUDENT SUCCESS. IN JUST ONE BRIEF COMMENT TO BUILDING ON OUR. INVERTED PYRAMID MODEL AND WILL SEND THAT THE DIAGRAM OF INTEGRITY WE WORK WITH ON THIS. THE THE OUT REACH THAT'S PRE CALL IS IMPORTANT BUT ALSO THE TRANSFER THE ADMISSIONS IN THE MESSAGING AT STUDENTS COME AND AND THAT'S SOMETHING WE'RE WORKING ON THE NEXT PHASE THAT ARE YOU SEE. INSTITUTIONALIZING EFFORTS IS ENSURING THAT OUR MISSIONS FOLKS ACTUALLY LOOK AT BASIC NEEDS PREPARATIONS AS A NET POSITIVE TO PROMOTE. THAT WE'RE HERE TO SUPPORT YOUR STUDENTS IN THE TIMES OF ALL FORMS OF CRISIS MENTAL HEALTH FOOD INSECURITY HOUSING INSECURITY. THAT WE'RE DEVELOPING THE SYSTEMS AND TOOLS TO HELP THEM SUCCEED AND THAT WILL ONLY BE SUCCESSFUL IF WE TIED THE PRE COLLEGE WITH THE PREPARATORY IN THE TRANSITION SUPPORT THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT FOR FIRST YEAR. AND TRANSFER STUDENTS AND THEN AS THEY COME IN WE HAVE CAL FRACTION FOR STUDENTS THAT DON'T QUALIFY WHETHER THE DOC UNDOCK A FORMALLY INCARCERATED YOUTH THAT WE HAVE PANTRIES AND SUPPORT SERVICES THAT PROVIDE SUPPLEMENTAL SUPPORT FOR STUDENTS WHO DON'T QUALIFY. FOR STATE OR FEDERAL AID PROGRAMS AND THAT IS THAT BIGGER PACKAGE OF INSTITUTIONALIZING SUCCESS THAT WERE ENVISIONING. AND THE GREAT WORK YOU GET TO DO WITH THE CCC IN CSU I THINK THE VILLAGE EFFORT REALLY BILLS THE STRENGTH OF THE WORK WE'RE UNDERTAKING. ALSO SOMETHING JUST REALLY QUICKLY WITH THE INFRASTRUCTURE NOW. THE I LOVE THE CONVERSATIONS OF INSTITUTIONALIZING BECAUSE WHEN WE TALK ABOUT HOW IMPORTANT IS FOR US TO BUILD RELATIONSHIPS WITH ACT COUNTIES. FOR CAL FRESH WORK SOMETHING THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT ALSO IS LIKE WE'RE REALLY EXCITED BECAUSE WE'VE CLARIFIED SO MUCH WITH CAL FRESH WITH REGARDS TO. UNDERGRADUATE AND GRADUATE STUDENTS RIGHT WE DONE SO MUCH OF THE POLICY WORK MEETING WITH A CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT SOCIAL SERVICES I COUNTY SOCIAL SERVICES THERE'S A GREAT PARTNER CALLED CODE FOR AMERICA THAT DEBT CREATED TO GET CAL FRESH. ONLINE TOOL THAT EXPEDITES AND SIMPLIFIES THE APPLICATION AND THEY'RE WORKING ON A STAR SEVEN HOW SIMPLIFICATION WHICH IS PHENOMENAL. AND WE STILL ARE WORKING WITH COUNTIES WHO WORKS GOING TO START RECEIVING APPLICATIONS IN THE HUNDREDS AND AND THE THOUSANDS WITH HOW HOW AT IT WITH THE PACE OF OUR SUCCESS. AND ARE WORKING WITH ONE FAX MACHINE TO PRODUCE ALL OF THOSE APPLICATIONS. SO THERE BEEN TIMES WHERE WE WILL SEND A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY APPLICATIONS AND THREE HOURS BUT OF THAT FAX MACHINE DIDN'T RECEIVE ALL THOSE ARE HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE APPLICATIONS. THEN THEY'RE ONLY GOING TO PROCESS AS MUCH AS THAT ONE FAX MACHINE IN THAT ONE COUNTY CAN DO SOMETHING SOMETHING THAT WERE ALSO BEING MINDFUL IS HOW DO WE TALK ABOUT THE INSTITUTIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE AND THE PRIORITY OF BASIC NEEDS. AND HOW DOES THAT IMPACT OUR PARTNERS BECAUSE EXCEPT FOR A PARTNERS HAVE TO BE ALSO ALIGNMENT WITH OURS WE CAN BE SENDING TWO THOUSAND APPLICATIONS AND ONLY ACTUALLY FIVE HUNDRED GET PRICES. BECAUSE THEY HAD ONE FAX MACHINE TO WORK OUT OF SO THE CONVERSATIONS ARE ALSO HAVING TO BUILD THE VILLAGE AND SAY HOW DO WE DO THIS TOGETHER. SO SOME OF OUR PARTNERS HAVE ASKED DON'T SEND ME A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FIVE APPLICATIONS IN ONE DAY. SEND ME TWENTY APPLICATIONS PER DAY SO THAT WE CAN HAVE A BETTER PROCESSING SYSTEM AND APPROVAL RATING BUT HOW DO YOU TELL A STUDENT YOU CAN APPLY TODAY YOU COME TOMORROW WHEN ALL OF OUR STUDENTS ARE SUFFERING FROM FOOD INSECURITY AND SOME OF THEM HOMELESSNESS AND FOOD INSECURITY. I AM THINK YOU I THINK I THINK THAT THIS IS A VERY HELPFUL TO NOW AND I HAVE JUST A QUICK QUESTION FOR ALL THREE. AND I NAY IN A COULDN'T UNDERSTAND I THINK ALL OF YOU TALKED ABOUT HOW IMPORTANT. IT WAS TO. EDUCATE OUR STUDENTS MAKE SURE THEY'RE EQUIPPED WITH THIS INFORMATION BY IS THE SUGGESTION THAT THIS HAPPENING QUE TWELVE AT THE END OF THEIR EACH YEAR OR IS THIS SOMETHING THAT'S EMBEDDED IN ORIENTATION FOR YOUR PARTICULAR INSTITUTION AND I GET THAT ORIENTATION IS. OPTIONAL. FOR SOME OF THESE INSTITUTIONS. I WOULD SUGGEST THAT IT HAPPENED IN BOTH PLACES IT NEEDS TO BE STATED AGAIN AND AGAIN THIS IS NOT FOR A LOT OF THE STUDENTS IN. ALL OF OUR SYSTEMS THEY NEED TO HEAR THIS MANY ARE FIRST GENERATION STUDENTS MANY HAVE LANGUAGE BARRIERS. THEY NEED TO HEAR THIS INFORMATION AS OFTEN AS POSSIBLE TO MAKE IT STICK BECAUSE IT'S A BIG TRANSITION OUT OF K. TWELVE AND INTO. COLLEGE IT'S IN A CULTURE SHOCK FOR MANY OF THE STUDENTS JUST FINANCIALLY SO I THINK IT SHOULD HAPPEN AT THE K. TWELVE SYSTEM AND A. UPON ORIENTATION INTO IT ANY ONE OF THE THREE SEGMENTS. AND THE CONVERSATION THAT I THINK THAT HE'S WAS BRINGING UP IS THE FACT THAT WE NEED TO HAVE PEOPLE ON OUR CAMPUSES THAT CAN DO THIS WORK. BECAUSE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN THEN I'LL GIVE AN EXAMPLE AT AT OUR CAMPUS AT BERKELEY. IT WE SAY LET'S FULLY INTEGRATE BASIC NEEDS AND TO THE ORIENTATION MODEL NOW IT'S GONNA BE MY RESPONSIBILITY TO DO THAT ON TOP OF MY RESPONSIBILITY FACILITATING SYSTEM MIGHT CONVERSATIONS AND BEING HERE WITH YOU ALL. SO THEN WHEN THERE'S IN SOME WHEN THERE'S NO PEOPLE ON THE CAMPUSES IT'S HAVING TO FIGURE OUT HOW DO WE MAKE THINGS HAPPEN AND THAT'S WHEN YOU HAVE TO ADD ANOTHER HAT ON ANOTHER HAD ANOTHER HOW TO FOLKS. THAT'S RIGHT YOUR COMMITMENT THIS LAST YEAR WAS CRUCIAL THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME THAT WE ACTUALLY HAD FUNDING TO HAVE PEOPLE AND NOT JUST SERVICES. BECAUSE WHEN YOU JUST HAVE SERVICES THAT NO PEOPLE A YEAR PRIOR GONNA GOING TO VOLUNTEER MODEL. BE YOU'RE GOING TO ACTIVATE STUDENTS AND WHATEVER CAPACITIES THEY HAVE AND THEN SEE THE QUALITY IN THE CONSISTENCY OF QUALITY OF SERVICES AT ALL OF OUR COLLEGE CAMPUSES. ARE GONNA BE INCREDIBLY WIDE OF A SPECTRUM YES SOME CAMPUSES RIGHT NOW THAT ARE SERVING UPWARDS OF LIKE EIGHT THOUSAND UNIQUE STUDENTS YOU HAVE OTHER CAMPUSES WERE SERVING EIGHT STUDENTS. AND THE NEED ISN'T THAT DIFFERENT AND THOSE TWO CAMPUSES SOMETHING THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GOING INTO THE CONVERSATION IS HONORING THE FACT THAT IT HAS TO HAPPEN ON CAMPUS BUT THEY HAVE TO COME PREPARED. TO DO THAT ALREADY AND FOR THOSE OF YOU ALL THAT READ THE LA TIMES THERE WAS A REALLY HIGH PROFILE STUDENT CASE ON THE LA TIMES FRONT COVER. PHOTOS VIDEOS ALL OF THAT BEING THE REASON WHY NEEDS TO BE HAPPENING ON BOTH IS BECAUSE THAT STUDENT WAS TOLD MULTIPLE TIMES TO COME TO THE BASIC NEEDS. SPACE ON CAMPUS WAS TOLD MULTIPLE TIMES TO TALK TO THE RIGHT PEOPLE THEY JUST FELT REALLY EMBARRASSED AND THEY FELT LIKE THEY HAD NO TIME TO DO THAT. BECAUSE OUR FAMILY WAS HOMELESS THEIR TWO SISTERS WERE HOMELESS AND THEIR BROTHER COULD BARELY KEEP UP THEIR JOB AND THEY WERE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO THAT TOGETHER AS A FAMILY. SO FOR THEM TO LEAVE THAT DATED A RHYTHM OF THAT TAKING CARE OF THE FAMILY TO COME MEET WITH ME TO HELP THEM FIGURE THINGS OUT IT ALWAYS FELT LIKE THEY WERE BETRAYING THEIR FAMILY. BECAUSE ONE HOUR AWAY FROM THE FAMILY WASN'T TAKING CARE OF THEM SO I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'RE WORKING ON RIGHT NOW. HOW DO WE BUILD A CULTURE WHERE WE CELEBRATE THE FACT THAT SUCCESSFUL STUDENTS PRIORITIZE THEIR BASIC NEEDS BECAUSE IN WE TOOK CARE OF THAT STUDENT WITHIN A FIFTEEN MINUTE MEETING? INDISCRIMINATE MEMBERS TO THAT YOU KNOW WE'RE TALKING A POPULATION OF ALMOST A MILLION OF THE STUDENTS WE SERVE IN THE STATE. SO THE SEVEN HAVE MILLION DOLLARS ARE HAVE GONE TO THAT AMPLIFY WHAT WE'RE ALREADY DOING WE'RE TRYING TO BE AS PROACTIVE AND PREVENTIVE IN OUR LONG TERM THINKING AS POSSIBLE. BUT THE POPULATION SIZE WERE SERVING ISN'T SMALL IN ANY MATTER SO JUST WE REALLY WANT TO PRESS UPON YOU THE APPRECIATION OF THE SUPPORT THIS LAST YEAR. IN THE ENORMITY OF WHAT WORK FACING GOING FORWARD SO THANK YOU AGAIN FOR MAKING TIME FOR US TODAY AND I JUST WANNA MAKE ONE COMMENT TO TO PIGGYBACK OFF OF THEIR ORIENTATION. ANOTHER IDEA IS ESPECIALLY FOR FIRST GENERATION STUDENTS HAVING ORIENTATIONS FOR THE PARENTS BECAUSE I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT AS WE TALK ABOUT PREPARING STUDENTS THAT PARENTS ON BOARD AND THEY UNDERSTAND THE COMMITMENTS AND. THUMB THAT SERVICES IN RESOURCE THAT SOURCES ARE AVAILABLE AND THAT'S WERE TALKING ABOUT A HOLISTIC EXPERIENCE ALSO DOING TRAINING FOR FACULTY AND STAFF TO TO LET THEM KNOW ABOUT WHAT RESOURCES ARE AVAILABLE BECAUSE MANY TIMES. FOR STUDENTS THEY MAY FEEL COMFORTABLE GOING TO A FACULTY OR ONE OF THEIR PROFESSORS AND THAT PERSON GIVE THEM THE WRONG. INFORMATION AND OR TELL THEM TO GO TO THE WRONG OFF THAT THEY MAY NOT OPEN UP AND SAY I NEED HELP AGAIN SO JUST MAKING SURE THAT EVEN ON CAMPUS OR DON'T WEAR NEST TO RESOURCES AND SERVICES AND PROGRAMS THAT ARE AVAILABLE. THINK IT WELL I APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS AND I THINK THEY THAT LEAST OF THIS YOU KNOW THIS HOUSE WAS REALLY INVESTED IN SEEN SOMETHING MOVE FORWARD. I THINK. WITH THE POPULATION OF OVER MILLION YOU THINK OF SEVEN POINT FIVE MILLION THAT WAS INVESTED OF THAT OF THIS. I'M WHICH IS YOU KNOW A DOLLAR PLUS I PER STUDENT OVER FIVE YEARS. IT'S IT'S NOT MAYBE WHAT WE NEED BUT I THINK THAT. IT'S DEFINITELY HISTORIC IN THAT THIS IS AN INVESTMENT FOR HIGHER ED AND. BASIC NEEDS AND WHAT I HOPE WE CAN LOOK AT IN THE COMING YEARS IS REALLY WHAT IS NEEDED I'M IN ORDER TO MEET OF THE. YOU KNOW VERY VERY IMPORTANT NEEDS FOR OUR STUDENTS I'M SO HEARING THAT YOU'RE ALREADY THINKING ABOUT WHAT INSTITUTIONALIZATION MEANS WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE THE AMMO USE WITH COUNTIES I MEAN THINGS THAT I THINK. WE WEREN'T FULLY AWARE WHAT IT WOULD BE AND I DO LOOK FORWARD TO THIS PRESENTATION AGAIN NEXT YEAR TO KNOW WHAT WHAT STILL MISSING. WHAT'S WORKED AT SO WE CAN CONTINUE TO BUILD ON THE THOUGHT OF WHAT NEEDS TO GO INTO THIS I THINK YOU. THANK YOU. SOME A MEMBER TING WHICH I FIRED BUDGET CHAIRPERSON DEXTER THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I I DON'T WANT TO THINK COME. MYSTERY MOAN INTO SUBCOMMITTEE FOR THEIR LEADERSHIP ON THIS VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE. I DID ONE. REITERATE I BY PRE SHAPED. FEEDBACK AND OF BEING THE FORMER HEAD OF THE NONPROFIT I UNDERSTAND THAT IS OFTEN VOTE IN TO FUND THE PEOPLE THAT. ACTUALLY IT IT TAKES TO IMPLEMENT THOSE SERVICES SO ON THE HOUSE. THIS AREA INVOLVED THAT THEY WILL BE HELPFUL FOR THIS COMMITTEE IS TO REALLY UNDERSTAND. SPECIFICALLY WHAT ARM. WHAT ABOUT PEOPLE OR SERVICES OR SPECIFICS ARE NEEDED AT EACH OF THE? THE SYSTEMS OFTEN WHAT WE GET IS WE GET A. YOU KNOW WE NEED FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR STUDENT HUNGER AND GETS. DOESN'T SAY IS IT FOR FOOD IS IT FOR OUR WAREHOUSE IS IT FOR STAFF AS IT FOR COMPUTER RIGHT. IN SO IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO EVALUATE AND. WE CAN SAY WELL WHY NOT ONE MILLION OR ONE NOT TEN MILLION RIGHT I MEAN IT'S IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO EVALUATE WHEN YOU DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND. THE SPECIFICITY OF IT ARM I DID HAVE A SPECIFIC QUESTION FOR THE GENTLEMAN FROM FROM BERKELEY WHICH COUNTY IS IT THAT ONLY HAS ONE FAX MACHINE. IT'S NOT JUST ONE COUNT. YEAH SO SO THIS WAS HAPPENING RIGHT AFTER THEY HAVE NAMES ARE THEY DO HAVE NAMED AFTER I GONNA GET BEAT UP AFTER THIS. THERE'S A COUPLE THINGS ARE GOING ON RIGHT NOW BUT BUT I GUESS I MEAN DIVERT THE REASON TO DOUBT THAT THAT'S A QUESTIONS LOOK YOU KNOW WE HAVE WE HAVE COLLEAGUES FROM EVERY PART OF THE STATE. YEAH IT'S IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT YOU KNOW. CALTRANS IS A VERY IMPORTANT STATE FUNDED PROGRAM EVEN THOUGH THE COUNTY'S ADMINISTER AT THE MONEY GOES THROUGH THE STATE TO GO THERE YEAH IF. THE MONEY'S GETTING BOTTLE NACKT THEY WERE NOT GETTING THE MONEY ON THE STREET YEAH. WE NEED TO KNOW ABOUT IT RIGHT SO IT'S NOT THIS SUBCOMMITTEE CALPERS GOES THROUGH BIG ASSERTIVE SUBCOMMITTEE YEAH BUT IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IF. IT BEGS THE QUESTION AS TO. YOU KNOW. WHAT AND WHY IS THAT GOING ON RIGHT AT YOUR OTHERWISE WE'RE GOING TO APPROPRIATE MONEY TO FOR THE SPECIFIC COUNTY TO GO GET? TECHNOLOGY UPGRADES OR WHATEVER ORG WOULD BE A TO FAX MACHINES YEAH I THINK I THINK THE GREAT OPPORTUNITY AND HOUSE TOTALLY YOU'RE HUSTLING BACK THERE IS I AGREE. PAL CAO GRANT AUTOMATIC CAO FRESH ABSOLUTELY YEAH YEAH I'VE THAT WHEN YOU'RE NOT A GREAT IDEA WHEN YOU GROW UP IN A FAMILY I GREW UP WHEN YOU'RE HUSTLING HOW YOU CAN LIVE A LOT OF THE LAST THE QUEST ARMY EVERY CAN HEAR IT SO. THE QUESTION IS YOU KNOW WHY CAN'T WE JUST DO YOU KNOW BASIC ELIGIBILITY STUFF YOUR. PAL ELIGIBLE YOU AUTOMATICALLY GET ELIGIBLE HE OUT FRESH THAT'S REACTIVE IT'S SO THAT I DON'T KNOW SO TWO THINGS TO SHAREWITH YOU ARE ONE IS WE'RE WORKING CLOSELY WITH OUR STATE OUT SOCIAL SERVICES TEAM. AND THEY'RE WONDERFUL ARM THE FOLKS ARE BEING VERY ACTIVATES A SPAN OF SAYING WE KNOW THIS WE DON'T KNOW THIS WE'VE TRIED THIS WE HAVEN'T TRIED THIS. FOR US TO STRATEGIZE HOW TO BEST MOVE FORWARD IN THIS CONVERSATION AND IN TERMS OF AUTOMATIC ELIGIBILITY IT COMES BACK TO THE INFRASTRUCTURE. SO WHEN YOU DO AUTOMATIC ENROLLMENT HOW DOES THAT LOOK LIKE WHEN SOME COUNTIES ARE OUR TECHNOLOGY INTEGRATED SOME CAMPUSES ARE STILL PAPER PAPER TRAIL. SO THEN DOES PROCESS THESE ARE GONNA BE DIFFERENT DEPENDING ON WHERE YOU ARE AND PROCESSING BY STUDENT COUNT AND EACH ONE OF OUR SYSTEMS YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THOUSANDS OF STUDENTS PER COUNTY. SO I THINK WE CAN START MOVING IN THAT DIRECTION AND WE CAN CERTAINLY PILOT SOME COUNTIES LIKE SAN DIEGO ALAMEDA SO ON AND SO FOR THAT ALREADY HAVE HIGH NUMBERS THAT ARE ARE. ARE INTERESTED IN BEING INNOVATORS AND PUSHING THE ENVELOPE TO SEE HOW THAT SCALING WORKS BUT IT'S GONNA BE SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO TAKE TIME PEOPLE AND RESOURCES FOR US TO PILOTS I LOVE THE INVITATION TO COME BACK I LOVE THE INVITATION TO BE TRANSPARENT ABOUT THE INFRASTRUCTURE. THAT'S NEEDED I THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE CAN COME BACK TO WITH OUR TEAMS BECAUSE NOW EVERYBODY HEARD IN THIS ROOM THAT THEY WERE BEING ASKED THAT. BECAUSE SOMETIMES WERE TOLD DON'T GIVE YOU ANYTHING THAT YOU DON'T ASK FOR SO NOW YOU ASK THOSE GREAT QUESTIONS THAT WE CAN MOVE IN THAT DIRECTION. AND I SAY THAT WITH A LOT OF LOVE FOR THE PEOPLE IN THE ROOM THAT I TOTALLY LOST AND YOU'RE NOT EVEN GIVE ABOVE OR ASK FOR SO THAT'S NOT. EH BUT BUT BUT AGAIN I THINK THAT. THAT'S NOT WE TALK NEXT YEAR YET MAYBE LISTLESS DO THIS LIKE TOMORROW YEAH YES BECAUSE THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING HUNGRY YESTERDAY LAST NIGHT YEAH IN SO YES. THEY'RE HUNDREDS AKA WE TEND EXTRA YEAH RIGHT IN SO I THINK THAT WE WANT TO UNDERSTAND. WHY? WERE SOME OF THE PITFALLS ARE BECAUSE OTHERWISE. IF MORE SPENDING MONEY AND IT'S NOT BEING USED CORRECTLY THAT'S NOT A GOOD USE OUR RESOURCES RIGHT EITHER. SO WE WE NEED TO REALLY UNDERSTAND HOW THAT'S WORKING FROM BEGINNING TO END. TO THAT STUDENTS THAT YOU'RE ALL TRYING TO SERVE CAN GET THE SERVICES THEY ARE ARE ARE OWED YET IS NOT WHAT I TALKING ABOUT WHAT THE DOES ELIGIBILITY DECISION. THEN GET IN THE SERVICES YEAH THEY. ALREADY ARE QUALIFY FOR WHAT'S THE BEST TO THROW BY SWEAT PRESS TO DO YOU CAN YOU CAN FOLLOW UP WITH MARK. OKAY MARX GLASSES PERSON ON THE DIET FOR HIS HIS HIS PERSONAL HABITS THAT ARE JGB MINNESOTA'S FALL FALL UP WITH HIM AND HE CAN CONNECT YOU SO WE CAN MAKE SURE WE INTEGRATE THAT WITH ALSO DAHLE THE VARIOUS. SOCIAL SERVICES THAT ARE BEING PRIDE PERFECT THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU TO MAKE YOU GET UP AND I KNOW MR MEDINA HAS SOME QUESTIONS BUT BUT THIS IS NOT. YOU KNOW OUR EXPERTISE THAT WE HAVE A CAL FRESH. HEARING ON THE OTHER SUBCOMMITTEE YEAH SO WE WILL BE OUR BOOK WILL WILL WE WILL COMMIT TO WORK WITH THEM TO SEE WHAT BARRIERS WE GET. PERFECT REDUCE TO IT TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE SELLING HIS ORCHESTRA MEDINA. I I THINK THE. WE ARE JUST BEGINNING TO SEE THE ENORMITY OF THE OF THE CHALLENGE AHEAD OF US AND I THINK TIM YOU WERE WITH US AT THE HEARING. AT FRESNO CITY COLLEGE WE'RE STUDENTS LINED UP FOR QUITE AWHILE. TWO OUT PRESENT THAT THE THE ISSUE AND. MOST RECENTLY FRIDAY I WAS AT UC RIVERSIDE AND AGAIN THE STUDENTS OF UC RIVERSIDE. I SHARED WITH ME THE SAME CONCERNS ATTA UC RIVERSIDE SO I I THINK IT'S STARTING TO SINK IN AND I PLAYED A PLOT OF THE DIFFERENT EFFORTS. BOTH BY THE STUDENTS AND AND THE LEGISLATURE IN ADDRESSING THE ISSUE BUT I A QUESTION THAT I WOULD POSE IS. DO WE HAVE ANY ANY INFORMATION ON THE CORRELATION BETWEEN FOOD AND SECURITY. OF STUDENTS AND THE RAISING OF TUITION. THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION WE DON'T HAVE ANY DATA AVAILABLE NOW ON THAT PER SE ONE OF THE MOST DIFFICULT ELEMENTS TO TEASE OUT IS THE LITERACY OF THE COSTS OF COLLEGE AND SO. FOCUSING ON THEM TUITION HAS OFTEN. KIND OF LEFT SOMETHING BEHIND THE CURTAIN KNOWN AS A COST OF ATTENDANCE THAT WERE REALLY FOCUSED ON. THE HOUSING THE FOOD THE SUPPLEMENTAL COSTS OF ACTUALLY SUCCEEDING IN BEING PRESENT IN COLLEGE. SO I'M EXPLORING THOSE TOGETHER I THINK COULD BE A MORE. BENEFICIAL FRUITFUL CONVERSATION. SO IT'S REALLY WELL NOTED TO KIND OF LOOK AT THAT IN IN CONJUNCTION WITH A LARGER ENVIRONMENT. I THINK ONE OF THE CHALLENGES WHEN YOU ASK THAT QUESTION I REALLY LIKE YOUR YOUR GRAY ASKING SOME REALLY GREAT QUESTIONS. THERE'S A LOT BEEN THE MAJORITY MEETINGS HAVE TO BE AND SO. ONE OF THE THINGS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE THAT WE DON'T TALK ABOUT ENOUGH IS THE FACT THAT WE UNDERSTAND COLLEGE AFFORDABILITY THROUGH THE LENS OF TUITION AND FEES. WHICH IS AN INCOMPLETE LANDS BECAUSE WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE HISTORY OF THE TOTAL COST OF ATTENDING A PUBLIC UNIVERSITY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HISTORICALLY. COST OF LIVING HAS ALWAYS BEEN MORE EXPENSIVE THAN TUITION AND FEES. SO WHEN WE DON'T TALK ABOUT THE TOTAL COST OF ATTENDANCE THEN THAT'S WHY WE'VE HAD GENERATIONS OF STUDENTS WHO HAVE STRUGGLED AT DIFFERENT LEVELS AND OBVIOUSLY TODAY'S STUDENT STRUGGLING EVEN MORE. JUST BECAUSE THINGS ARE MORE EXPENSIVE IN THE COST OF LIVING IS MORE EXPENSIVE TODAY. THERE'S A THERE'S BEEN SO MANY FACULTY THAT I'VE MET WAY IT'S ADMINISTRATORS THAT I'VE MET WITH FOLKS IN THE NONPROFIT WORLD AND THIRD PARTY ENTITIES. THAT JUST CANDIDLY SHARE WITH ME YOU KNOW WHAT I DON'T KNOW WHY THIS GENERATION STRUGGLING SO MUCH I WORKED MY WAY THROUGH COLLEGE. SO WHEN WHEN I HEAR FOLKS SAY THAT I ASK THEM HOW MUCH DID YOU PAY FOR RENTS WHEN YOU WERE IN COLLEGE. HOW MUCH WHAT YOUR FOOD BUDGET WHEN YOU WERE IN COLLEGE? HOW MUCH WISE IN YOUR BANK ACCOUNT WHEN YOU ARE IN COLLEGE AND YOU FELT COMFORTABLE? BECAUSE OF WHAT WAS IN YOUR BANK ACCOUNT TODAY STUDENTS ARE PROBABLY PAYING ANYWHERE FROM THREE TO FIVE TIMES MORE THAN WHAT YOU PAID FOR RENT. I'D TODAY STUDENTS ARE PAYING SIGNIFICANTLY MORE FOR FOOD SIGNIFICANT MORE FOR BOOKS SO ON AND SO FORTH. SO I THINK THAT CONVERSATION TO SOMETHING THAT WERE VERY COMMITTED TO AMPLIFYING AND SAYING TUITION AND FEES IS ONE THING COST OF LIVING IS ANOTHER. AND IN THAT THE COST OF LIVING CONVERSATION DO WE HAVE SPECIFIC QUALITY OF DATA I DON'T BELIEVE WE DO OTHER THEN WE KNOW THAT STICKER SHOCK CONTINUES TO BE ONE OF THE LARGEST REASONS WHY WE HAVE UNDER MATCHING HAPPENING. BOMB STICKER SHOCK CONTINUES TO BE ONE OF THE REASONS WHY MANY FIRST GENERATION COLLEGE STUDENTS STUDENTS OF COLOR. WOMEN AND LGBT PLUS STUDENTS SEE THE COST OF THAT AND KNOW THAT THE LIKELIHOOD OF THEM BEING ABLE TO PAY THAT OFF IS VERY MINIMAL BECAUSE NOBODY TAUGHT THEM HOW FINANCIAL AID WORKS. NOBODY HAD A CONVERSATION WITH THEM TO SAY YOUR TUITION AND FEES BECAUSE YOU QUALIFY FOR THE PAL GRANT AND THE CAL GRANT ARE GOING TO BE TAKING CARE OF WHAT WE NEED TO FOCUS WITH THE U. S. TO SAY. HOW DOES A LOAN SYSTEM WORK WHAT ARE YOUR COST OF LIVING SO THAT YOU KNOW HOW YOU'RE GOING TO ADDRESS THE DATA DAY IN COLLEGE? BECAUSE WHEN YOU TALK TO A FAMILY I LOVE DENISE'S POINT ABOUT FAMILY PREPARATION BECAUSE A FAMILY WILL ASK WELL THAT'S GREAT BUT HOW YOU GONNA PAY FOR RENT. BECAUSE I CAN'T PAY FOR YOUR RIGHT HOW YOU GONNA PAY FOR FOOD BECAUSE I'M NOT GONNA FEE NOT NO I'M GONNA BREAK IN FOR SECOND YEAH GO AHEAD BECAUSE. AS CHAIR OF HIGHER EDUCATION I VERY WELL UNDERSTAND THAT THE COST OF ATTENDING COLLEGE. IS NOT JUST TUITION AND FEES YEAH ALL THE DIFFERENT THINGS THAT YOU SAID HOUSING BOOKS TRANSPORTATION. AND AND WE HAVE ATTEMPTED TO TRY IN THE LEGISLATURE TO EXPAND. OF THE CAL GRANT SYSTEM TO ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE NEEDS. BUT WE IN THE LEGISLATURE DON'T CONTROL. A COST OF HOUSING COSTA BOOKS WHAT WE DO CONTROL. IS TUITION AND FEES. SO I I WOULD ALSO GIVE YOU A ASK YOU TO COME BACK. AND TRY TO FLESH THAT OUT OKAY OKAY BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE TO ME THAT THERE IS A CORRELATION. AS FEES OF INCREASED. AS TUITION AS INCREASE WE HAVE BEGUN TO HEAR MORE AND MORE. STUDENTS. ABOUT THE FOOD INSECURITY AND HOUSING IN SECURITY SO I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THAT YEAH AND IF WE COULD GO BACK YEAH AND EXAMINE THAT I I THINK THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL. AND AGAIN. AT SOME THINGS WE DON'T CONTROL BUT TUITION AND FEES WE DO YEAH AND. I I THINK WE NEED TO DO BETTER WOULD YOU LIKE US TO COME BACK WITH BOTH QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE ON THAT. YOU WANNA KNOW THE EXPONENTIAL DATA. EVERYTHING YOU CAN PRODUCE A WHOLE PREDOMINANT CULTURE BECAUSE WHEN I GO BACK TO OUR RESEARCH HE WAS GONNA COME FROM IS GONNA BE GREAT YEAH. QUESTION. YEAH YEAH MISTER MARTZ WHICH. YEAH. THAT'S A TRIP WITH. MAYBE IT JUST SEEMS LIKE A. RECURRING THEME IN AND BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE HEARING SAID. MORE MORE WHERE WE'RE HEARING IT JUST LIKE THE REST OF THE STATE. YOU KNOW IT'S THE HOUSING CRISIS I MEAN THE IT. AND AND AND SO WHILE WE'RE HAVING DEBATES ABOUT LEGISLATION TO TO INCENTIVIZE TO. YOU KNOW OF MORE AND AND HIGHER DENSITY HOUSING. I I THINK WE NEED TO JUST NOT JUST FOCUS ON. FOOD AND SECURITY BUT I THINK THE BIGGER PICTURE IS THAT THEY DID THAT DRIVING COST OF HOUSING AND SO I THINK WE NEED TO. YOU NOW HAVE MORE FOCUS ON. HOW CAN WE YOU KNOW EITHER THROUGH? A BOND OR OR OR OR MORE OF A FUNDING FOR OUR UNIVERSITIES TO BUILD MORE STUDENT HOUSING MORE HIGH DENSITY STUDENT HOUSING. IN ORDER MAKE HOUSING MORE AFFORDABLE I THINK THAT IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF A CONVERSATION THAT I. HAVEN'T BEEN HEARING WHO. COULD I JUST ADD ONE COMMENT ON YOUR NOTE YOU KNOW IN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM. WE DON'T HAVE HOUSING PER SE WE HAVE ELEVEN OF THE CAMPUSES THAT OFFER DORMITORIES. BUT WE ARE LOOKING AT A PROGRAM MODEL THAT'S HAPPENING DOWN IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY WITH AN ORGANIZATION CALLED HOVHANESS. AND THEY HAVE SOMETHING CALLED THE COLLEGE SUCCESS INITIATIVE THEY'RE USING UP COUNTY HOUSING DOLLARS AND PHILANTHROPIC DOLLARS. TO SUPPORT COMMUNITY COLLEGE THEY'RE WORKING WITH FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGES RIGHT NOW. TO PROVIDE RAPID RE HOUSING SERVICES TO PROVIDE HOUSING NAVIGATION SERVICES AND TO PROVIDE SUBSIDIES RENTAL SUBSIDIES FOR STUDENTS AND SO I. I THINK IT'S WORTH LOOKING AT I THINK IT'S UP BECAUSE I DON'T THINK THAT THERE'S ENOUGH MONEY IN EDUCATION TO SOLVE THE HOUSING CRISIS MAYBE THERE IS I DON'T KNOW BUT. BUT THIS IS A MODEL WHERE THEY'RE ACTUALLY LEVERAGING DOLLARS THAT ARE DESIGNATED FOR HOUSING EACH CLOCK COUNTY HAS A COORDINATED ENTRY PROGRAM. THAT SERVES HOMELESS PEOPLE IN GENERAL NOT EXCLUSIVE TO COLLEGE STUDENTS. BUT HOW DO WE GET CONNECTED WITH THOSE COORDINATED ENTRY FOLKS LOCALLY TO TO EXPAND THE WORK TO SUPPORT HOMELESS PEOPLE TO INCLUDE HOMELESS COLLEGE STUDENTS. AND WE SEE IT HAPPENING CONTRA COSTA WE SEE IT HAPPENING IN LOS ANGELES I THINK IT'S WORTH LOOKING AT THAT PROGRAM MODEL. AND AND TRYING TO FURTHER THAT EXPAND THAT SCALE THAT BECAUSE THOSE ARE HOUSING DOLLARS DESIGNATED FOR HOUSING SERVICES. SO IT'S JUST SOMETHING FOR CONSIDERATION IS ALSO A BILL ON NINE EIGHTEEN THAT WOULD CREATE ALSO HOUSING BILL THAT WOULD CREATE A SIXTY MILLION DOLLAR PROGRAM FOR TRANSITION AGE YOUTH UNACCOMPANIED YOUTH IN CALIFORNIA. I I THINK THAT IS ALSO SOMETHING THAT AND THOSE WHO I THINK WOULD BE USING PROP SIXTY FOUR DOLLARS THOUGH PLEASE DON'T QUOTE ME ON THAT. BUT IT'S THOSE TYPES OF INITIATIVES THAT ARE GROUNDED IN THE HOUSING WORK SPACE THAT MAKES THE MOST SENSE. ESPECIALLY FOR A SYSTEM OF OUR SIZE AND WITH THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS THAT WE HAVE AND SO I THOSE ARE THINGS I THINK WE SHOULD LOOK AT. AND TRY TO EXPLORE AND TRY TO EXPAND UPON. OKAY FAIR ENOUGH I KNOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HUNGER HERE. TIMELY BUT IT'S IT'S A BIG ISSUE BUT I DO END UP JUST A FEW THINGS. AT FOR A PURPORTED MOVE ON ONE IS. AS OUR OUR BUDGET SERIOUSLY TO WHO WE DON'T CONTROL FEES AGAIN IT'S UP TO THE SEGMENTS GRANTED. THEY SAY IF WE FIND THE SYSTEMATIC QUICKLY THERE'S NOT THE PRESSURE TO INCREASE SPEED THE FIRST PLACE SO SO I GET THAT BUT. YOU KNOW IN LARGE PART THAT THAT BUILT THE NEEDIEST STUDENTS EITHER TELL GRANT RECIPIENTS OR CAL GRANT SO THAT SO THE TUITION. IS SOMEWHAT OFF THE TABLES KEEP ON THE MIDDLE THEY GET THE SQUEEZE PEOPLE THEIR FIFTH YEAR THEY DON'T GET THE COVER ANYMORE. BUT IT REALLY ARE THE OTHER ISSUES THAT REALLY COMPOUND THIS AND SO ACOSTA LIVING WE TALKED ABOUT. LAST YEAR. INCREASING OUR OUR CAL GRANT UMBER RACE HE RESTRUCTURING THE CAL GRANT PROGRAM SO IT COVERS NOT JUST THAT THE TUITION COSTS BECAUSE REALLY IT'S THE COST OF INSTRUCTION AS WE AS WE NOTED SO. THAT'S YOU KNOW LARGER DISCUSSION THAT WE TALK ABOUT A FEW WEEKS AGO THAT WOULD THAT WOULD CONTINUE BUT. BUT ON THIS. WE KNOW THAT OUR WORK IS NOT DONE AND AND I THINK THERE'S SOME THINGS THAT WILL TAKE A LOOK AT WHERE THIS YEAR AND. IN THE FUTURE AS WELL SO. SING NO FURTHER QUESTIONS ON ISSUE NUMBER ONE ALSO A CROSS CUTTING ISSUE. THE LAST FEW YEARS RELATES TO YOU SEE CSU OR COMMITTEE COLLEGES RELATES TO. OUR FACULTY AND FACULTY DIVERSE CITY WE HAVE A PANEL FROM THE UNIVERSE CALIFORNIA AND. CSU CANCERS OFFICE. AS WELL AS OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES. OKAY. SO WE'LL START WITH THAT YOU SUSAN TALKED CARLSON CORRECT OKAY THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING I I'M SUSAN CARLSON I'M THE VICE PROVOST FOR ACADEMIC PERSONNEL AND PROGRAMS AT THE UC OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT. I'M PLEASED TO REPORT YOU BRIEFLY ON THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA'S USES OF THE FUNDING. ALLOCATED TO SUPPORT FACULTY ADVERSITY FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS. WE'VE NAMED OUR PROGRAM ADVANCING FACULTY DIVERSITY. A COVERING THE HIRING THAT HAS RESULTED THE BEST PRACTICES THAT ARE EMERGING AND THE WAYS IN WHICH THIS PILOT PROGRAM HAS PROVIDED INCENTIVES FOR NEW PROCESSES. SO TO RECAP BRIEFLY LET ME NOTE THAT WE FELT IT WAS IMPORTANT TO AWARD THESE PRECIOUS FUNDS THROUGH A COMPETITIVE PROCESS. AND TO ENSURE THAT WE COULD MEASURE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE EXPENDITURES. SO THAT WE WOULD KNOW HOW ADDITIONAL EXPENDITURES COULD ADD VALUE IN OUR EFFORTS TO DIVERSIFY THE FACT FACULTY. SO I'D LIKE TO SPEAK YOU BRIEFLY ABOUT OUR EFFORTS IN THE TWO THOUSAND SIXTEENSEVENTEEN YEAR AND THEN IN THE CURRENT YEAR AS WELL. WE'RE PLEASED WITH THE RESULTS OF OUR THREE PILOTS FOR TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN. EARLY ON WE DETERMINED THAT THE BEST USE OF THE FUNDS WHICH TO SUPPORT A FEW COLLEGES AND US SCHOOLS SELECTED THROUGH A COMPETITIVE SYSTEM WIDE PROCESS. THESE WERE UNITS READY TO TAKE ADDITIONAL STEPS TO DIVERSIFY THEIR FACULTY AND TO CREATE AN INCLUSIVE ENVIRONMENT. NEARLY ALL OF THE FUNDING WENT TO THREE UNITS UNDERTAKING IMPORTANT HIRING DURING THE YEAR. SO THAT WAS THE BOREN'S A COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING AT UC RIVERSIDE THE JACOBS SCHOOL OF ENGINEERING AT UC SAN DIEGO. AND THE COLLEGE OF AGRICULTURAL AND NATURAL RESOURCES AT UC DAVIS. IT IS CLEAR THAT THE FOCUS INFUSION OF FUNDS MADE A DIFFERENCE IN FACULTY DIVERSITY RELATIVE TO THESE UNITS PAST PERFORMANCE. AND TO THE COMPARED TO UNITS WE USE TO MEASURE THEIR SUCCESS. ALL THREE UNITS SAW SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN PRACTICE AND IN CONVERSATIONS AS WELL AS AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF NEW FACULTY WHO HAVE MADE VALUABLE CONTRIBUTIONS TO DIVERSITY AND TO IMPROVING THE ACADEMIC CLIMATE. FOR ARE UNDERREPRESENTED MINORITIES AND WOMEN. CANDIDATES WHO MADE IT TO THE FINALIST INTERVIEWS WERE SUBSTANTIALLY MORE DIVERSE BY GENDER AND RACE ETHNICITY AND ALL THREE UNITS. AND THE DIVERSITY OF HIRING WAS IMPROVED SIT HERE SOME SPECIFICS. IN THE PROVOST DIVERSITY AND ENGINEERING FELLOWS PROGRAM AT RIVERSIDE THREE OF THE THREE PLANNED HIRES WERE FEMALE. TO WERE UNDERREPRESENTED MINORITIES AND THE THIRD WAS A PERSON OF COLOR. THIS IS A REMARKABLE ACHIEVEMENT IN ENGINEERING. AND THE UC SAN DIEGO ENGINEERING PILOT THERE WERE EIGHT FEMALES AMONG THE TWENTY TWO HIRES OR THIRTY SIX PERCENT. AND FOR UNDERREPRESENTED MINORITIES AMONG TWENTY TWO HIRES OR ROUGHLY EIGHTEEN PERCENT. AGAIN THIS HIRING IS A THREE FOLD INCREASE ON THE DIP UP CURRENT FACULTY DIVERSITY DEMOGRAPHICS. THESE NEW UC SAN DIEGO HIRES ARE ALREADY WORKING WITH K. TWELVE SCHOOLS AND UNDER. UCSD STUDENTS IN SPECIAL COURSES AND PROGRAMS THEY'VE DESIGNED IN THEIR FIRST YEAR. IN THE PROGRAM AT UC DAVIS THE COLLEGE HIRED FOR FEMALES AND ONE UNDERREPRESENTED MINORITY FACULTY. OUT OF TOTAL HIRES OF THIRTEEN. AND YOU KNOW IN THE CONTEXT OF PROPOSITION TWO ARE NINE THESE UNITS DID NOT HIRE BASED ON RACE OR GENDER. BUT FOCUSED ON THE RECRUITMENT STRATEGIES AND THE DEPARTMENT PRIORITIES THAT WOULD ATTRACT DIVERSE CANDIDATES READY TO DO THEIR RESEARCH AND TEACHING. ANY UNIVERSITY COMMITTED TO DIVERSE STUDENTS AND COMMUNITIES. FOR EXAMPLE CONTRIBUTIONS TO DIVERSITY STATEMENTS FIGURED PROMINENTLY AND ALL THREE PILOTS. AND NOTABLY ALL THREE PILOTS WERE IN STEM DISCIPLINES WHERE THE DIVERSITY OF NEW P. H. D.'S AND THIS IS THE NATIONAL AVAILABILITY IS NOT AS DIVERSE AS WE WOULD WANT. AND OUR FINAL REPORT WHICH WE FILED WITH THE LAST NOVEMBER WE FOCUS ON THE PERCENTAGE OF HIRES THAT WERE FEMALE ARE UNDERREPRESENTED MINORITIES AND NOT ON THESE HEAD COUNTS. AND THAT WAS SO THAT THE RESULTS COULD BE MEASURED AGAINST PAST YEARS AGAINST COMPARATOR GROUPS. AND UNDERSTOOD IN THE CONTEXT OF THE AVAILABLE POOL OF CANDIDATES. IN THE SECOND YEAR WHICH IS STILL COURSE ONGOING WE'VE HAD AGAIN A COMPETITIVE PROCESS TO DETERMINE WHICH UNIT SHOULD RECEIVE FUNDING. AND WE DECIDED TO SPREAD THEIR WORDS OVER FOR PILOTS THIS YEAR. THAT INCLUDES THE UC BERKELEY COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING. UC IRVINE'S SCHOOLS OF BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES ENGINEERING INFORMATION IN COMPUTER SCIENCES AND PHYSICAL SCIENCES. YOU SEE SAN FRANCISCO SCHOOLS OF DENTISTRY MEDICINE NURSING AND PHARMACY. AND UC SANTA BARBARA'S DEPARTMENT OF ECONOMICS. SO IN ADDITION TO ONE COLLEGE WHICH WAS ENGINEERING AT BERKELEY WE INCLUDED ONE DEPARTMENT ECONOMICS AT SANTA BARBARA AND TWO CLUSTERS OF SCHOOLS AT IRVINE AND IT SAN FRANCISCO. WITH THIS RANGE OF KINDS AND SIZES OF UNITS WE CAN TEST THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THIS FINANCIAL INCENTIVE. AND OF INTERVENTIONS AND STRATEGIES AT DIFFERENT SCALES. WE'RE CONTINUING SOME OF THE PRACTICES THAT PROVED EFFECTIVE IN YEAR ONE INCLUDING ENHANCED OUTREACH THE USE OF A POST DOCTORAL FELLOWSHIP YEAR TO RECRUIT. TAPPING INTO THE PROVEN TALENT OF THE DIVERSE FELLOWS IN THE PRESIDENT'S POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIP PROGRAM AND THE CHANCELLOR'S POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIP PROGRAMS. INTERVENING AND TRADITIONAL EVALUATION PRACTICES AND TARGETED USE OF START UP FUNDS. OTHER NOTABLE INTERVENTIONS IN THE SECOND YEAR INCLUDE MORE INCLUSION OF STUDENTS IN THE HIRING PROCESS. MAKING USE OF CAMPUS EQUITY ADVISORS. CREATING PEER MENTORING COHORTS OF NEW FACULTY. AND HIRING AT THE SENIOR LEVEL THROUGH ENDOWED CHAIRS. I'M PLEASED TO REPORT THAT IN THIS YEAR'S FOR PILOTS OF THE ADVANCING FACULTY DIVERSITY PROGRAM HAS PROVEN TO BE AN INCENTIVE FOR SIGNIFICANT CAMPUS INVESTMENT. INCLUDING THE ALLOCATION OF ADDITIONAL FACULTY FD. AND THE COMPETITION FOR THE SECOND YEAR OF AWARDS WE DID NOT REQUIRE THAT THE CAMPUS IS PROVIDE ANY KIND OF MATCHING FUNDS BUT MOST OF THEM DID. THIS SUGGESTS I BELIEVE HOW POWERFUL THE SPECIFIC ALLOCATION TO SUPPORT FACULTY DIVERSITY HAS BEEN. WE'RE CONTINUING WITH MANY OTHER EFFORTS IN RECRUITMENT AND WOOD BUILDING INCLUSIVE DEPARTMENTAL CLIMATES ACROSS THAT. CAMPUSES FOR EXAMPLE IT'S NOW STANDARD PRACTICE ON MOST OF OUR CAMPUSES TO REQUIRE CANDIDATES FOR A FACULTY POSITIONS. TO SUBMIT A CONTRIBUTIONS TO DIVERSITY STATEMENT IN WHICH THEY DETAIL PAST EFFORTS IN THEIR TEACHING OUTREACH OR RESEARCH. AND TO TELL US HOW THEY WILL CONTINUE SUCH EFFORTS ONCE THEY JOIN THE UC FACULTY. OUR PILOT UNITS ARE MAKING THIS STATEMENT A CENTRAL PART OF THE EVALUATION PROCESS. AND FINALLY BOTH THE CAMPUSES AND THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT ARE SUPPORTING RESEARCH THAT WILL HELP US UNDERSTAND WHICH RECRUITMENT. EFFORTS ACTUALLY WORK IN OUR EFFORTS TO BUILD THE DIVERSE FACULTY OF THE FUTURE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. CSU. GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS MELISSA BARD AND I SERVICE THE VICE CHANCELLOR FOR HUMAN RESOURCES AT THE CSU OFFICE OF THE CHANCELLOR. THIS ISSUE HAS MADE SIGNIFICANT STRIDES IN RECRUITING A DIVERSE AND REPRESENTATIVE COHORT OF PRESIDENTIAL LEADERSHIP. IN FACT WE RECENTLY CELEBRATED A MILESTONE OF THE MAJORITY OF TWELVE WOMEN AMONG OUR TWENTY THREE PRESIDENTS. IT IS CLEAR FROM THE RESPONSE TO THAT SUCCESS HOW IMPORTANT IT IS FOR OUR STUDENTS TO HAVE ROLE MODELS WHO SHARE SOME OF THEIR EXPERIENCES. THAT IS WHY WE ARE WORKING SO DILIGENTLY TO REPLICATE THAT SUCCESS AT THE FACULTY LEVEL. THESE ARE NEW CONVERSATIONS AT THE CSU AND WE HAVE BEEN MAKING STEADY PROGRESS FOR A LONG TIME. IF THE FIRST FIGURE AND TABLE IN YOUR HANDOUT SHOWS THESE CHANGES OVER TIME. THE PERCENTAGE OF FACULTY WHO IDENTIFY THEMSELVES AS WHITE WAS EIGHTY ONE PERCENT TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO. SIXTY NINE PERCENT TEN YEARS AGO. AND IS ABOUT SIXTY ONE PERCENT AS A FALL TWENTY SEVENTEEN. THE GENDER GAP IS ALSO CLOSING. TEN YEARS AGO ONLY FORTY ONE PERCENT OF FACULTY WERE FEMALE COMPARED TO FORTY SEVEN PERCENT AS A FALL TWENTY SEVENTEEN. AS A ARE A MAJORITY OF NEW FACULTY HIRES. ONE OF OUR SIGNATURE PROGRAMS THE CHANCELLOR'S DOCTORAL INCENTIVE PROGRAM IS CELEBRATING ITS THIRTIETH ANNIVERSARY THIS YEAR. SINCE ITS INCEPTION THE PROGRAM HAS HAS THAT APPROXIMATELY SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY ALUMNI IN TO SEE IT YOU FACULTY POSITIONS. FORTY THREE PERCENT OF THOSE FACULTY MEMBERS. ARE UNDER REPRESENTED MINORITY GROUPS COMPARED TO ONLY ABOUT FIFTEEN PERCENT OF THE CURRENT FACULTY. HOWEVER WE KNOW WE CAN DO MORE. THE LEGISLATURE'S FINANCIAL SUPPORT OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS COINCIDES WITH AN UPTICK IN TENURE TRACK HIRING AS CAMPUSES REPLACE FACULTY POSITIONS. LOST DURING THE RECESSION AND ADD ADDITIONAL FIVE WOULD BE IN SUPPORT OF THE GRADUATION INITIATIVE TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. THAT HAS PROVIDED US WITH THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE REAL PROGRESS FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE THE RECESSION. TABLE TO IN YOUR HANDOUT SHOWS OUTCOMES FOR RECRUITMENT FOR FACULTY WHO JOIN THE CSU AND SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN. AS WELL AS PRELIMINARY OUTCOMES FOR SEARCHES FOR FACULTY WHO WILL BE JOINING THE CSU AND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN. IN SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN AND SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN JUST OVER FIFTY PERCENT OF NEW FACULTY IDENTIFIED THEMSELVES AS WHITE. WELL BELOW THE SIXTY FOUR PERCENT IN THE GENERAL FACULTY POPULATION. RESULTS APPEAR TO BE SIMILAR FOR THE FACULTY BEING RECRUITED FOR TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN. ALTHOUGH MANY OF THE SEARCHES ARE STILL IN PROGRESS. AT THIS POINT IN THE YEAR WE ALWAYS HAVE A LARGE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS FOR HIM RACE OR ETHNICITY IS STILL UNKNOWN BUT THOSE NUMBERS WILL SUBSTANTIALLY LOWER BY THE TIME THE NEW FACULTY COME ON BOARD AND FALL. BASED ON THESE PRELIMINARY DATA WE ARE HOPEFUL THAT THE CLASS OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN WILL BE ANOTHER VERY DIVERSE GROUP. MOVING NOW TO SPECIFIC USES OF THE FUNDING THE LAST TWO YEARS. IN TWENTY SIXTEEN AND SEVENTEEN. RECOGNISING THE CHALLENGE OF CREATING SUSTAINING MOMENTUM AND A LARGE AND COMPLEX SYSTEM FUNDS FROM SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN HAVE BEEN USED IN WAYS INTENDED TO BOTH TO HAVE IMMEDIATE IMPACT. AND SUPPORT LONG TERM CHANGE. WE'VE USED THE FUNDS TO RAISE THE VILLAINS VISIBILITY OF THE CS YOU AS AN EMPLOYER OF CHOICE THAT MAJOR HIGHER EDUCATION DIVERSITY CONFERENCES AND ORGANIZATIONS. SUCH AS THE SOCIETY FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF CHICANOS AND NATIVE AMERICANS IN SCIENCE. A PHD PROJECT AND OTHERS. WE'VE PROVIDED INCENTIVES TO CAMPUSES THE RECRUIT GRADUATES OF THE CHANCELLOR'S DOCTORAL INCENTIVE PROGRAM. THIS YEAR THE FUND SUPPORTED START UP COSTS FOR FIFTEEN NEW FACULTY OF HIM TEN WHERE MEMBERS OF MINORITY GROUPS AND ELEVEN WERE WOMEN'S. WE'VE PROVIDED CAMPUSES WITH SEED MONEY TO SUPPORT IMPLEMENTING BEST PRACTICES FOR RECRUITING AND RETAINING DIVERSE FACULTY. THE FUNDS FOR TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND EIGHTEEN REVIEWS DIFFERENTLY. WE FUNDED ELEVEN CAMPUS PROJECTS THROUGH A COMPETITIVE REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. ALL PROPOSALS HAD TO ADDRESS HOW THE WORK WOULD BE SUSTAINED LONG TERM AND HOW SUCCESSFUL ACTIVITIES COULD BE ADOPTED BY OTHER CSU CAMPUSES. THESE AWARDS WERE MADE IN LATE DECEMBER OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN AFTER MUCH RECRUITING FOR EIGHTEEN NINETEEN WAS ALREADY COMPLETE. SO MOST PROJECTS INCLUDE ACTIVITIES THAT WILL IMPACT NEXT YEAR'S RECRUITING CYCLE AS WELL AS THIS YEAR'S. ONE EXAMPLE IS CSU FRESNO. THEY'RE FOCUSING ON BUILDING A PIPELINE OF STRONG STEM CANDIDATES STARTING WITH THEIR OWN ALUMNI AND INCLUDING REGIONAL AND NATIONAL PARTNERS. THE CAMPUS WILL BRING SENIOR GRAD STUDENTS AND POSTDOCS TO CAMPUS TO GIVE SEMINARS AND MEET FACULTY AND STUDENTS AND OFFER A WEEKLONG BICU CAMP THIS SUMMER. FOCUSED ON ACADEMIC CAREERS AND COMPREHENSIVE UNIVERSITIES. THEIR GOAL IS TO DOUBLE THE NUMBER OF UNDERREPRESENTED MINORITY FACULTY HIRED IN THE SCIENCES COMPARED TO CURRENT LEVELS. THE FUNDING BY THE LEGISLATURE TODAY AS HAVING IMPORTANT IMPACT IN SEVERAL WAYS. FIRST NEW FACULTY HIRING IS CHANGING THE SHAPE OF THE FACULTY OVERALL. FOR EXAMPLE AS A FALL TWENTY SEVENTEEN MORE THAN TWENTY PERCENT OF ALL CURRENTLY ACTIVE AFRICAN AMERICAN FACULTY HAD BEEN HIRED IN EITHER TWENTY SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN OR TWENTY SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN CITY. FORTY ONE PERCENT OF NEW HIRES IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN WHERE MEMBERS OF MINORITY GROUPS. COMPARED TO ONLY ABOUT TWENTY FIVE PERCENT A RECENT DOCTORAL RECIPIENTS NATIONWIDE. SECOND CAMPUSES HAVE INCREASINGLY EMBRACE BEST PRACTICES INCLUDING THIS PAST YEAR. CAMPUS ADMINISTRATORS STARTING WITH PRESIDENT AND PROVOST HAD MADE IT CLEAR THAT A DIVERSE FACULTY IS CRUCIAL TO STUDENT SUCCESS AND THESE PRIORITIES ARE INCREASING INCREASINGLY EMBEDDED IN THEIR SEARCH PROCESSES. CAMPUSES ARE ALSO FOCUSING ON RETAINING FACULTY OF COLOR THROUGH SUPPORT ON THE PATH TO TENURE AND MAKING SURE NEW RECRUITS FILL PART OF THE UNIVERSITY COMMUNITY. FINALLY THE FUNDING CREATES AWARENESS AND SENDS THE MESSAGE THAT THESE ACTIVITIES ARE IMPORTANT TO THE CSU AND TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. GIVEN CAMPUSES LIMITED BUDGET FOR RECRUITING A PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT. EVEN MODEST ADDITIONAL SUPPORT CAN HAVE A DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACT. WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE INNOVATIONS FUNDED THIS YEAR CONTINUED AND EXPANDED. OUR BEST EFFORTS TO BRING IN NEW TENURE LINE FACULTY WILL BE POSSIBLE WHEN THE CSU BUDGET REQUEST IS FULLY FUNDED. IF THE CSU BUDGET REQUEST IS NOT FULLY FUNDED NOT ONLY IS IT LIKELY THAT BUDGETS THAT SUPPORT RECRUITING WILL BE STRAINED BUT IT'S VERY LIKELY THE NUMBER OF CAMPUSES WILL SIGNIFICANTLY SCALE BACK TENURE TRACK RECRUITING IN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN. THAT COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR GOAL FOR A MORE DIVERSE FACULTY AND THAT'S WHY OUR TOP PRIORITY IS FOR FUNDING FOR THE CSU. THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU NEXT. GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS JACOB NAP I'M A REPRESENTING THAT CALIFORNIA COMMUNICABLE JUST CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE. THE COMMUNICABLE DO BUDGET INCLUDES CATEGORICAL PROGRAM DEDICATED TO EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY FOR THAT AVERAGES ABOUT TWO POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY. AT THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE ALLOCATES. RESOURCES FROM THE E. O. FUN TO OUR SEVENTY TWO COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICTS FOR THE LOCAL PROMOTION. OF E. O. PROGRAMS AND ACTIVITIES EACH DISTRICTS WE BELIEVE IS IN THE BEST POSITION TO UNDERSTAND LOCAL NEEDS AND UTILIZE LIMITED E. RESOURCES. EFFICIENTLY AND EFFECTIVELY. THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE ALSO USES A PORTION OF THE OEO FUND EACH YEAR OUGHT TO PAY FOR AND RUN A SYSTEM WIDE EYED JOBS BOARD IN DATABASE. AT THE PROMOTES. EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES WITHIN THE COMMUNICATIVE STEM AND LINKS. APPLICANTS WITH LOCAL DISTRICTS. SO A LITTLE BIT OF BACKGROUND WE RECENTLY CHANGED. ARE FUNDING ALLOCATION MODEL WITH IN THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNICORP SYSTEM HISTORICALLY. WE DISTRIBUTE FUNDS FROM THE EEO FUND BASED ON THE F. T. S. OF EACH DISTRICT. BUT TWO YEARS AGO WE ARE WE MADE A SWITCH AND. OR STATEWIDE E. OWN DIVERSITY. ADVISORY GROUP IDENTIFIED NINE BEST PRACTICE AREAS IN PROMOTING EEO AND THOSE ARE ON PAGE SEVEN OF YOUR AGENDA. AND WHAT WE REQUIRE NO BRING ORDER FOR DISTRICT TO RECEIVE. OF A PORTION OF THE STATEWIDE EEL FUND IS THEY'VE TO CERTIFY TO THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE. THAT THEY MEET. MULTIPLE METHOD NUMBER ONE OF WHICH IS HAVING A AND E. DEAL PLAN FOR THE DISTRICTS IN E. O. ADVISORY COMMITTEE. AND THAT THEY REPORT ANNUALLY ON THE WAY THAT THEY SPENT THEIR FUNDING. THEY NEED TO MEET THAT MULTIPLE METHOD NUMBER ONE AND SIX OF THE REMAINING MULTIPLE METHODS THAT HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED BY THE STATEWIDE GROUP. THAT CERTIFICATION HAS TO BE SIGNED BY THE CHAIR OF THE LOCAL BOARD OF TRUSTEES OF THE CEO. OF THE DISTRICT. IN THE CHIEF HR OFFICER. THE IDEA WAS TO. TO HAVE ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THE USE OF THESE FUNDS AND ALSO TO. TO RAISE AWARENESS. IN DIFFERENT AREAS OF THE STATE ABOUT THE REALLY GOOD WORK THAT IS GOING ON. AND SOME OF THESE LOCAL. EEL PROGRAMS. JUST TO GIVE YOU A LITTLE FLAVOR OF THE NINE MULTIPLE METHOD AREAS ARE BROKEN INTO PRE HIRING. HIRING AND POST HIRING IN THE INCLUDE THINGS LIKE. YOU ARE USING FOCUSED OUR REGION PUBLICATIONS ARE YOU OFFERING INCENTIVES FOR HARD TO HIGHER AREAS OR DISCIPLINES. DO YOU HAVE ANY. GROW YOUR OWN PROGRAMS AT YOUR LOCAL DISTRICT AND ARE YOU PROVIDING CONSISTENT AND ONGOING TRAINING. FOR YOUR HIRING COMMITTEES. SO EACH DISTRICTS EEL ADVISORY COMMITTEE. IS RESPONSIBLE FOR. ENSURING THAT THE DISTRICTS E. O. PLAN IS IMPLEMENTED AN UPDATED REGULARLY. BY TETHERING THE RECEIPT OF EEL FUNDS TO SUBMISSIONS OF THESE MULTIPLE METHODS CERTIFICATIONS. THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE HAS DRAMATICALLY INCREASED A DISTRICT COMPLIANCE WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF FOR ONE THE DISTRICT SUBMIT E. O. PLANS EVERY THREE YEARS TO THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE. IN TWENTY FIFTEEN DECEMBER TWENTY FIFTEEN JUST OVER FIFTY PERCENT OF OUR DISTRICTS WERE. IN COMPLIANCE WITH THAT REQUIREMENT. AND ONCE FUNDING WAS TETHERED TO HAVING THOSE. THOSE THINGS IN PLACE THAT YOUR PLAN THE ADVISORY COMMITTEE. WERE AT ALMOST ONE HUNDRED PERCENT COMPLIANCE WITH HAVING THOSE. IMPORTANT STRUCTURES AT ALL OF OUR LOCAL COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICTS. SO TOTALING FUNDS TO. TO HAVING A ROBUST E. O. PLANS LOCALLY. WE'VE SEEN THAT IT'S HAD A AN ACTUAL IMPACT IT'S PROPORTIONAL TO THE FUNDING. IN TWENTY SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE WAS ABLE TO ALLOCATE FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS TO EACH LOCAL DISTRICT. AGAIN WERE SPLITTING THIS SEVENTY TWO WAYS SO WE'RE ABLE TO ALLOCATE FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS EACH LOCAL DISTRICT. THAT CERTIFY COMPLIANCE WITH THE MULTIPLE METHODS. CERTIFICATION PROCESS. THROUGH THE SUBMISSION OF THE MULTIPLE METHODS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE REQUIRES IS THAT THE DISTRICT PROVIDE A NARRATIVE OF WHAT THE DISTRICT IS DOING. TO. TO PROMOTE IO IN EACH OF THOSE NINE AREAS AND. THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE THEN COLLECTS THIS INFORMATION AND I IN THROUGH STATEWIDE COMMITTEE. TWO YEARS AGO WE PRODUCED A. IN E. OWN DIVERSITY BEST PRACTICES MANUAL THAT HIGHLIGHTS OF SOME OF THE BEST IDEAS THAT WE SAW IN DIFFERENT LOCAL DISTRICTS WHICH ARE REALLY LIKE. LABORATORIES FOR. FOR TRYING NEW AND INNOVATIVE EEO PROGRAM SO WE WE REALLY ARE TRYING TO CONNECT OUR DISTRICTS WITH ONE ANOTHER A TO SEE WHAT'S WORKING AND WHAT'S NOT WORKING OBVIOUSLY IT WILL IT WILL. DIFFER IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE STATE. OF SO THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH THE LOCAL FUNDS OUT FROM THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE PERSPECTIVE. WE ARE FOCUSING THIS YEAR ON. PROMOTING. ATTENTION IMPORTANCE TO THE USE OF DATA IN LOCAL E. O. PROGRAMS AT THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE INITIATE A PROGRAM AT TO ASSIST OUR LOCAL DISTRICTS WITH THE COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS. OF LOCAL DISTRICT DEMOGRAPHIC APPLICANTS IN EMPLOYMENT DATA. ARE DISTRICTS HAVE BEEN REQUIRED IN THE. THE REGULATIONS OF THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS AYE IN TITLE FIVE TWO COLLECT AND ANALYZE OF LOCAL. APPLICANT DATA FROM DISABLED SO YOU HAVE A. A FACULTY FULL TIME FACULTY POSITION WHO WAS IN THE INITIAL APPLICANT POOL WHO WAS STILL IN THE POOL ONCE YOU RUN THE MINIMUM QUALIFICATIONS. WHO RECEIVED AN INTERVIEW? WHO WAS HIRED WHO IS PROMOTED ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE SPECTRUM OF EMPLOYMENT? IN THERE ARE VARIOUS STATISTICAL ANALYSES THAT THAT YOU CAN IMPLEMENT TO SEE. IF THERE ARE ANY. PLACES ALONG THE SPECTRUM OF EMPLOYMENT WHERE THERE MAY BE A DISPARATE IMPACT. TO CERTAIN MONITOR GROUPS SO WE JUST TWO WEEKS AGO THREE WEEKS AGO. PRODUCED THE. EEL LONGITUDINAL A DATA GUIDE. THAT YOU RECEIVED A COPY OF IT'S ON OUR WEBSITE AND WE ARE. THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE WILL BE PROVIDING STATEWIDE TRAININGS OF THIS FALL NINE FIVE DIFFERENT AREAS OF THE STATE FOR OUR LOCAL HR OFFICERS AND INTERESTED FACULTY. AND AND STAFF. SO THAT OUR SYSTEM IN OUR LOCAL DISTRICTS WILL HAVE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE THE POWER OF. DATA. IN THE EEL CONTEXT. AND THE THE VERY. GOOD RESULTS THAT WE CAN SEE OUT FROM USING THE DATA APPROPRIATELY. NOT HAPPEN ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THE PRESENTATION. START WITH THAT. GETTING RID. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. ARM JUST TO FALL BUT THAT. CAN YOU COLLEGES COULD YOU ON. DE GIVE A LITTLE MORE SPECIFICITY AROUND HOW YOUR EFFORTS IMPACTED RECRUITING IMPACT POLL. ON THERE WASN'T ANY. SPECIFIC DATA ABOUT HOW THE ACTIONS WERE. CREATING AN IMPACT SURE ARE ON PAGE SEVEN OF YOUR AGENDA WE HAVE SOME SOME DATA ABOUT THE DEMOGRAPHIC COMPOSITION. OF OUR. TENURE TENURE TRACK FULL TIME FACULTY. SYSTEM WIDE. I WILL SAY AB SO TWO THINGS ONE ALL OF THE DATA THAT THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE IS COLLECTED FROM OUR LOCAL DISTRICTS GOING BACK MORE THAN TEN YEARS. IS UP PUBLICLY AVAILABLE ON OUR WEBSITE IN YOU WE ACTUALLY JUST ADAPTED A NEW TOOL THAT YOU CAN RUN VARIOUS ANALYSES TO SEE THE WAY THE TRENDS OF CHANGED OVER TIME. I WILL SAY THAT OUR STUDENT POPULATION SO BE NO SURPRISE. IS. OVER FIFTY FIVE PERCENT UNDER REPRESENTED MINORITIES. OUR FULL TIME TENURE TENURE TRACK FACULTY. IS. IS NOT NEARLY. THAT DIVERSE. I DO BELIEVE THAT WE ARE AT ABOUT TWENTY TWO PERCENT UNDERREPRESENTED MINORITY. AND THE FAMILY ASPECT WHICH AGAINST YOU CAN ANSWER IT SHORT ARM. WHAT IMPACTS HAVE TO ROB ACTUALLY YOU'VE OUTLINED? HOUSE ON YOUR ABILITY TO RECRUIT AND HIRE MORE DIVERSE FACULTY. THE DATA THAT WE'VE RECEIVED ANSWERED THAT QUESTION CERTIFICATE THAT THE GREAT THE DATA THAT WE'VE RECEIVED IN THE LAST TWO YEARS OF FROM OUR LOCAL DISTRICTS RELATED TO FIRST TIME HIRES. HAS SHOWN THAT THE. PERCENTAGE OF UNDER REPRESENTED MINORITIES HAS INCREASED FROM TWENTY PERCENT IN TWENTY FIFTEEN. TO THIRTY PERCENT. JUST LAST YEARS WE'VE SEEN A FIFTY PERCENT INCREASE IN WHAT'S BEEN REPORTED AS UNDERREPRESENTED MINORITY HIRES FIRST TIME BUYERS FROM A LOCAL DISTRICT THAT'S GREAT AND WHAT THE LOCAL DISTRICT TRIBUTE THAT TO. AND I'M SURE IT'S DIFFERENT FOR DIFFERENT AREAS BUT IN. MAYBE YOU CAN GIVE ME SOME EXAMPLES FOR YOU KNOW. IT IS DIFFERENT FROM DIFFERENT DISTRICTS AND YOU KNOW WE WE RECEIVE MORE INFORMATIONS FROM SOME DISTRICTS THAN OTHERS. BUT I I I DO KNOW THAT. MANY DISTRICTS HAVE REPORTED THAT THE. THE INFLUX IN FULL TIME HIRING DOLLARS ONE TIME TWO YEARS AGO. IT ENABLED. MORE HIRING TO TAKE PLACE THAT PARTICULAR YEAR WHICH REMEMBER INCOMMUNICADO SYSTEM WITH OVER EIGHTEEN THOUSAND FULL TIME FACULTY. EVERY YEAR WERE HIRING OF ITS. PEBBLES INTO A POND IMPORTANT COUPLES. BUT DOWN I KNOW WAS REPORTED IS VERY IMPORTANT. THESE EEO DOLLARS AND NOT ONLY SOME OF THE PROGRAM'S LOCALLY THAT HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED BUT. THE. EMPHASIS THAT'S BEEN PLACED ON. BEST PRACTICES THROUGHOUT THE SYSTEM WE'VE HAD MANY DISTRICTS THAT HAVE SO THAT THAT'S BEEN INCREDIBLY HELPFUL AND. HAS ALLOWED THEM TO ADOPT PROGRAMS THAT BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN OTHER PLACES WHAT IT WILL BE HELPFUL WAS P. JUST TO GET A. GREATER UNDERSTANDING OF SPECIFICALLY WHAT PROGRAMS AND WHAT COLLEGES ARE DISTRICTS ARE. BEING SUCCESSFUL FOR OUR AND WHAT'S WORKING OBVIOUSLY UNDERSTAND THAT DIFFERENT. COLLEGES MAY DO DIFFERENT THINGS AND THAT'S TOTALLY UNDERSTANDABLE. BUT IT'S UNDER IT WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHAT WHAT'S WORKING ABSOLUTELY I. I CAN PULL TOGETHER MORE INFORMATION AND WE ALREADY HAVE THE PUBLICATION THAT WE PUT TOGETHER LAST YEAR ON THE BEST PRACTICES UNIVERSITY BEST PRACTICES MANUAL. THAT. I DID NOT PROVIDE YOU A COPY WITH TODAY IT'S ON OUR WEBSITE KNOW MAKE SURE THAT YOU GET A COPY. BUT IT ACTUALLY IT'S FOR OUR STATEWIDE EEO COMMITTEE SELECTED THE THREE BEST PROGRAMS THAT FRIEND IN THEIR OPINION FROM EACH OF OUR SEVENTY TWO DISTRICTS IN THE NINE BEST PRACTICE AREAS. GREAT IT BE GREAT TO GET A BREAKDOWN OF THAT TENURE DATACOM BACK IN TERMS OF THE. CHANGED ON MY PRE* THAT THE CHART THAT ARM. DISBARRED PROVIDED US FROM CSU TO KIND OF GIVE US A LITTLE OF BIT OF HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE. AND AND TO MISS BARD I'M. KICKING YOU WALK US THROUGH A LITTLE BIT HOW THE LOW POINT NINE MILLION WAS SPENT. ARE. WHAT THE VARIETY CAMPUSES I DON'T KNOW IF THERE WERE? SPENT A SIMILAR WAYS ARE ALL DIFFERENT WAYS. SURE WE HAVE. OBVIOUSLY TWENTY THREE CAMPUSES AND NINETEEN CAMPUSES SUBMITTED A PROPOSAL AND WE FUNDED ELEVEN OF THOSE. TRUMP I HAVE A BREAKDOWN THAT'S NOT IN YOUR IN YOUR MATERIALS BUT I BEACH I'M HAPPY THIS TO SHARE WITH YOU AND THEY HAD A LOT OF DIFFERENT IDEAS. ONE OF THE COMMON THREADS THAT WE SAW IN ALMOST EVERY PROPOSAL WAS A NEED FOR MORE. SEARCH COMMITTEE TRAININGS PARTICULARLY AROUND UNCONSCIOUS BIAS AND SIMILAR THINGS AND SO THAT THAT SEND A MESSAGE TO MYSELF AND MY STAFF THAT THOSE ARE THINGS THAT WE PUT WE NEEDED TO WORK ONE ABOVE AND BEYOND THIS. PARTICULAR PROPOSAL BUT DEVELOPMENT AND AND SHARE THAT SYSTEMICALLY SO THAT'S SOMETHING WE'RE WORKING ON AND THEN THE THE INDIVIDUAL CAMPUSES. PALM FRESNO ART CAO POLY SAN LUIS OBISPO SAN BERNADINE NO AND THE OTHER EIGHT. ALL HAVE A VARIETY OF THINGS SOME OF THEM ON ASKS FOR FUNDING TO HELP US START UP COSTS. I'M AND HELP SOME OTHER ADJUNCT AND THEIR TEMPORARY FACULTY BE SUPPORTED FOR RESEARCH OPPORTUNITIES ON BECAUSE. THERE'S A CERTAINLY AGREE A LARGE POOL WITH OF TEMPORARY FACULTY THAT COULD. BECOME TENURE TRACK IN THE SEARCH PROCESS AND SOME OF THAT SUPPORT THAT THEY DON'T HAVE. FACULTY WERE INTERESTED IN MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR A PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT WHETHER THAT BE CONFERENCES OR NETWORKS THERE WERE ALSO A LOT OF PROPOSALS AROUND INCLUSION. BECAUSE I THINK ALL OF US RECOGNIZE THAT RECRUITING AND HIRING A DIVERSE PERSON IS IS NOT THE AND THAT'S ONLY THE BEGINNING. AND SO THERE'S A A LARGE FOCUS ON THE COMMUNITIES ON THE CAMPUSES OF INCLUSION EFFORT ON CAMPUS AND NETWORKS AND AND AND MAKING SURE THAT THEY FEEL WELCOMED AND AND. THEIR TALENTS ARE YOU GUYS ON THE CAMPUSES OUT AND I'D BE HAPPY TO SHARE I HAVE COPIES OF THE DOCUMENT OF ALL OF THE CAMPUS PROGRAMS IF YOU WOULD LIKE THAT I CAN PROVIDE THAT TO YOU AS WELL YEAH YES PLACE. EITHER ONE OF THE. PROMISES OF THE HOME INITIAL FUNDING WAS. TO INSURE THAT THERE WAS ADEQUATE RECRUITMENT AND IN POOL WE CONSTANTLY HAVE TO HEAR. THAT DE UM THERE'S LIKE A PIPELINE THERE IS LACK OF APPLICANTS. SO HOME I I'D ACTUALLY AGREE WITH I'M HAVING A SEARCH COMMITTEE TO HAVING THE SEARCH COMMITTEE TRAINED BY. THE SEARCH COMMITTEE DOES NEED TO BE TRAINED IF YOU DON'T HAVE DIVERSE POOL TO INTERVIEW FROM SO. I THINK THAT WAS VERY VERY FIRST THING THAT HOME WE WERE VERY FOCUSED ON SO I WOULD BE INTERESTED IN. HEARING ABOUT HOW THOSE CAMPUSES. HANDLED THOSE EFFORTS SIGN IF YOU HAVE ANY INFORMATION SUMA SIMILAR TO WHAT MISS CALLS HIM I THINK PROVIDED FREE FOR YOU SEE I THINK YOU COULD SEE THAT YOU SEE OBVIOUSLY THERE. DEAF YOUR CAMPUSES FEWER DEPARTMENTS BUT. THEY THEY CHOOSE LITERALLY ONLY FOR DEPARTMENTS THEY GAVE EACH A DECENT. CHUNK OF MONEY BY THINK YOU COULD YOU COULD SEE THE RESULTS SORT. SHORT NOT CERTAINLY AND A COUPLE OF THE CAMPUS IS REALLY FOCUSED ON STEM DISCIPLINES AND. SAID THERE WERE CERTAINLY SOME FOCUS CAMPUS SPECIFIC BUT THERE WAS A LOT OF INTERESTING GETTING AND INVOLVED WITH THE. OUR POSTDOCS AND OUR GRAD STUDENTS AND GOING OUT TO SOME OF THOSE NETWORKS I ONLY MENTIONED A FEW OF THE CONFERENCES FOR EXAMPLE OF A DIVERSITY COMMENTS IS THAT WE'VE ATTENDED. BUT THERE WAS. A LOT OF EFFORT AROUND HELP WE CAN WE REACH AND CREATE MORE DIVERSE POOLS AND. CERTAINLY AND WE CAN PULL SOME MORE INFORMATION FOR YOU ARE NOT SPECIFICALLY DEFINED A HELPFUL THAT THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL. AND I JUST WONDERED JUST FAT FAKE COME. HISPIDUS CARLSON. FOR THE. I THINK FOR THE PRESENTATION WE REALLY APPRECIATE THE. SPECIFICITY IT REGARDING THE DEPARTMENTS AND. I THINK IT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO HAVE A LITTLE MORE. UNDERSTANDING AT THE DEPARTMENT LEVEL WHAT SOME OF THE FUNDS WERE SPENT FOR I MEAN WE BECAME A LOT OF DISCRETION. AND. I DON'T I THINK WHAT WE'RE JUST LOOK REFORMERS FEEDBACK AS TO WHAT WAS EFFECTIVE IN THEIR MIND. THAT BECAUSE I KNOW THAT WE HAVE OUR OWN PART I HAVE MY OWN BELIEFS OF WHAT MIGHT BE EFFECTIVE BUT I THINK THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO REALLY GET. SPECIFIC FEEDBACK FROM THE FACULTY MEMBERS WHO WERE IN CHARGE OF. THOSE AYE RECRUITMENT AND SEARCH PROCESSES OF WHAT WHAT WORKED WHAT DIDN'T WORK. AND WHERE WHERE WE CAN AMPLIFY YOUR YOUR EFFORTS AT OTHER CAMPUSES AS WELL AS AT CSU AND ACT. ON COMMUNICORP IS OBVIOUSLY KNOWING THAT EACH OF THE. SEGMENT IS DIFFERENT BUT YET. THAT YOU'RE THERE PROBABLY THAT THE THE PLACES WHERE YOU'RE GOING TO CONFERENCES ARE FINITE THE PHD PROGRAMS ARE FINITE PHD GRADUATES ARE. ARE FINE I DIDN'T IN ESSENCE. BICU ARE GOING AFTER. GET OF SOMEWHAT SIMILAR. SIMILAR POOLS OF PEOPLE. AND. I I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT BOTH YEARS OR THE CURRENT YEAR. I THINK BOTH BOTH FIGHTERS WOULD BE AND WOULD BE HELPFUL I I DON'T THINK WERE LOOKING FOR A LINE LIKE I'M. YOU KNOW LIKE I TWENTY TWENTY YOU HAVE BUDGETS FOR YOU ALLEN NIGHT I JUST THINK JUST JUST TO GET SOME FEEDBACK AS TO WHAT WHAT WAS WHAT WAS WORKING. AND WOULD BE GREAT IN TERMS OF ON. IRAQ DOT ARE DESERTING YOU MENTIONED THAT SOME OF THE MONEY WENT TO FELLOWSHIPS WHICH WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN SOMETHING THAT WOULD HAVE NECESSARILY OUR CURRENT ME BAD. OBVIOUSLY SEEMS LIKE A MIX LAW SENSE BECAUSE WHY NOT GIVE THEM A FELLOWSHIP SO THEN YOU HAVE A CHANCE TO. ITEMS LIKE THE WAY WE APPROACH OUR FELLOWSHIP PROGRAM HERE AT THE CAPITOL BECAUSE YOU GET. TENDS TO SEE PEOPLE THAT YOU WOULD GET TO WORK WITH THEM FOR A YEAR SO THEN YOU REALLY SEE. BUT THEY'RE LIKE FIRST AS A IN A TWO HOUR INTERVIEW SO THAT I THINK THAT MAYES COSTS A LOT OF SENSE COME AND AND I THOUGHT THAT WAS VERY INTERESTING. APPROACH AND SO I CAN GIVE YOU A COUPLE EXAMPLES BUT BUT AT A HIGHER LEVEL FOR THESE UNITS TO GET A. LARGE AMOUNT OF MONEY. WAS IT AN AMAZING INCENTIVE WAS JUST LIKE. OKAY. WE DON'T NORMALLY GET THIS MUCH MONEY IN A SINGLE YEAR TO HELP US WITH HIRING AND THERE'S. VERY LITTLE THAT FACULTY CARE ABOUT MORE THAN HIRING RIGHT FINDING THE RIGHT COLLEAGUES. TO JOIN THEM SO THAT IN ITSELF MADE A BIG DIFFERENCE AND AS A MOTIVATOR. BUT THE FELLOWSHIPS. IN THE FIRST YEAR RIVERSIDE. PART OF THE AMAZING SUCCESS THEY HAD IN ENGINEERING OF RECRUITING THIS DIVERSE GROUP WAS. UP THROUGH THE OFFER OF THAT EIGHTY FIVE FUNDED A FULLY FUNDED YEAR AS A POSTDOCTORAL. SCHOLAR IN ADDITION TO WHATEVER OTHER POST DOCTORAL WORK THEY HAD DONE AND ALLOW IT LETTUCE DID GET INTO THE POOL A LITTLE BIT EARLIER WHEN IT'S. A LITTLE BIT MORE DIVERSE AND CONVINCE THEM THAT THIS WAS THE PLACE FOR THEM. IT'S ALSO BEING BEEN USED EFFECTIVELY THIS YEAR YET. SANTA BARBARA AND ECONOMICS. I THINK IT'S A AYE. A MECHANISM IT'S EXPENSIVE BUT IT'S A MECHANISM THAT I THINK TOM WOULD WORK A LOT OF DISCIPLINES. AND I THINK THAT'S GREAT I THINK THAT'S GREAT FEEDBACK WHAT I UNDERSTAND IT IS. EXPENSIVE BUT IT'S. THESE ARE POSITIONS THAT YOU HAVE A PERSON FOR POTENTIALLY THIRTY AFTER THIRTY YEARS SINCE. WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT OVER THIRTY YEARS IT'S NOT VERY EXPENSIVE AT ALL. SO I THINK THANK YOU FOR THE. MR MEDINA. AS WE TALK ABOUT THE EXPENSE. NOT I'M LOOKING HERE IT SAYS THAT ESTIMATED. A FUNDING FOR THIS YEAR IS ONE POINT THREE MILLION AS OPPOSED TO TWO POINT THREE MILLION. FROM THE PREVIOUS YEAR. WHAT I'M READING HERE IN FRONT OF ME? THAT IS IS THAT. CORRECT. ADDITIONAL FUNDING. WE PUT ONE TIME MONEY IN THE BUDGET LATIMES TO YEAR'S THAT THERE'S THERE'S NO MONEY IN THIS YEAR'S GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED BUDGET WE COULD CONSIDER AGAIN WHEN WE CLOSE OUT OUR BUDGET. OF ANY EIGHTEEN BUT I JUST HEARD THE IMPORTANCE OF OF FUNDING AND HOW EXPENSIVE THIS IS. AND IT'S CERTAINLY IMPORTANT. ONE THING THAT I THINK IS MISSING IN THE DATA HERE IN FRONT OF US. IS THE COMPARISON BETWEEN FACULTY AND THE STUDENT BODY A WE HEARD FROM THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE THAT THE STUDENT BODY IS. FIFTY PERCENT. MINORITY FIFTY PERCENT. OF STUDENTS OF COLOR. A SIX PERCENT UNDER REPRESENTED MINORITIES RIGHT. FIFTY SIX PERCENT UNDER REPRESENTED MINORITY WITHIN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM. CRACKED AND STILL AND FACULTY OF COLOR MAKE UP. WHAT PERCENT OF I BELIEVE IT IS APPROXIMATELY TWENTY TWO TO TWENTY THREE PERCENT UNDERREPRESENTED MINORITY FULL TIME FACULTY FACULTY? AND IT. YOU KNOW I I THINK THIS IS A. LOU TO DETAIL HERE FROM UC AND CSU BUT IF I WERE TO ASK YOU. SAY FOR EXAMPLE. FOR A. LET'S LET'S GO TO LATINO STUDENTS WITHIN CSU. CAN YOU GIVE ME WHAT PERCENTAGE OF OUR STUDENTS IN CSU OR LATINO STUDENTS. I DO NOT HAVE THE EXACT NUMBER BUT I WILL GET THEM FOR YOU BUT I I WOULD SUGGEST THAT IT'S PROBABLY CLOSE TO FIFTY PERCENT I WOULD SAY YOU'RE RIGHT YEAH I THINK. BUT STILL OF FACULTY ARE ONLY FOUR POINT FIVE PERCENT LATINO. WHIP WHERE STUDENT BODY IS A. ABOUT FIFTY PERCENT WITHIN CSU. AND FOUR POINT FIVE. I LIKE DINO FACULTY. ASKED THE SAME QUESTION TO YOU SEE. AND IF YOU COULD TELL ME WHAT PERCENT OF OF THE STUDENTS AT UC ARE LATINO. AND I ALSO BECAUSE I DON'T WORK INSTANCE I DON'T DOUBTS WHEN IT COME MONTHS A AND WILL KNOW THE NUMBER. SAY EVER CAN ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR SICK GOVERNMENTAL RELATIONS FOR UC OUT YOU SEE IS ABOUT THIRTY TWO PERCENT YOU ARE AND STUDENTS UNDERREPRESENTED MINORITY THIRTY PERCENT. THIRTY PERCENT AND IF COULD YOU BREAK IT DOWN A LITTLE BIT MORE. FOR ME. HOW MANY A OF THAT THIRTY PERCENT MIGHT BE LATINO STUDENTS BUT SOMEBODY ELSE COMING UP? I'M HELPING MY SEIZE YOUR COLLEAGUE. WHEN THERE'S. I I'M SORRY I DON'T HAVE THE THE SPECIFIC DATA RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME OF THIS PUMP ALTHOUGH THE LARGEST PORTION IS THE LATINO SO MAYBE THIRTY PERCENT. MIGHT BE. WE WE KNOW THAT IN THE LAST GENERAL. ADMISSIONS PERIOD THAT LATINO STUDENTS WERE ALMOST FORTY PERCENT OF THOSE WHO OF THE ADMITTED STUDENT YEAH. FORTY PERCENT OF ADMITTED STUDENTS NEW STUDENTS COMING AT. OF THE APPLICATIONS CYCLE OF AYE HAPLOTYPE DON'T KNOW THE EMOTIONS NUMBER FOR THAT AGAIN. BUT DO YOU KNOW FACULTY ONLY MAKE UP FOUR POINT FIVE PERCENT. OF TENURED FACULTY. AND ANOTHER THING WE DON'T HAVE HERE IN FRONT OF THIS IS THE LONGITUDINAL. FOR THE HISTORIC GROWTH. OR I WOULD SAY. PERHAPS LACK OF GROWTH. UP OF FACULTY UP. OVERALL RIGHT OVERALL BECAUSE I HAVE SEEN THE DATA WE WITH THE DATA WAS GIVEN TO US A IN THE LATINO CAUCUS IN THE BLACK CAUCUS. OF FOR THE PAST FORTY YEARS. SO I I I WOULD. COMMAND. BOTH UC AND CSU. OF FOR FOR. MOVING THE NEEDLE A LITTLE BIT. BUT I WOULD POINT OUT THE STUDY THAT WAS DONE OR THE. NEWS STORIES THAT RECENTLY CAME OUT SHOWING THAT DISPARITY THE DISPARITY BETWEEN FACULTY. AND. AND STUDENTS. WE WE WE HEARD EARLIER THIS MORNING ABOUT TEN MILLION DOLLARS. PROPOSED UP FROM THE GOVERNOR. TO. DO ONLINE. RIGHT TO IT INCREASE ONLINE EDUCATION WITH THE PURPOSE OF INCREASING A STAND. AND NOW. THE GRADUATES RIGHT IN UC AND CSU. I AYE MY PROPOSAL THAT TEN MILLION DOLLARS COULD BE BETTER SPENT. ON HIRING MORE MINORITY FACULTY IN UC AND CSU. QUESTION TO. CSU. SPECIFICALLY AT THAT THE SAN LUIS OBISPO. CAMPUS. A LACK OF THAT DIVERSITY AMONG STUDENTS AND AND I THINK LACK OF DIVERSITY FACULTY A CAMPUS THAT PRODUCES PROBABLY OF MAYBE THE LARGEST NUMBER OF ENGINEERS. A IN THE CSU SYSTEM HA HOW COULD SEE AS YOU DO BETTER. AT THE. SAN LUIS OBISPO CAMPUS. THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION AND I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT SAN LUIS OBISPO HAS THE FULL SUPPORT OF THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE AND THEY HAVE AN INCREDIBLY SUPPORTIVE PRESIDENT. WHO'S VERY INTERESTED IN THIS ISSUE CONCERNED ABOUT THIS THIS ISSUE AND IS DOING A NUMBER OF. THINGS ON CAMPUS TO TRY TO WIDEN AND AND BECOME MORE DIVERSE ON IT'S NOT ADMITTEDLY MOVING AS QUICKLY AS I THINK WE WOULD ALL LIKE BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF INITIATIVES THERE AND. YOU KNOW I WOULD BE HAPPY TO HAVE A SOMETHING PUT TOGETHER THAT WOULD GIVE YOU A FULL PICTURE OF WHAT'S BEING DONE THERE. AND AND AND I DO WANNA COMMEND BOTH CSU AND UC FOR FOR THEIR EFFORTS AND YOU MENTIONED. YOU SEE MENTIONED UC RIVERSIDE. AND I KNOW THAT YOU SEE RIVERSIDE IS. THE MOST DIVERSE CAMPUSES STUDENT BODY. AND THAT WE'RE MAKING. ADVANCES IN THE FACULTY. COULD YOU TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT CLUSTER HIRING THAT UC RIVERSIDE. A HAS USED. A CLUSTER HIRING A I DON'T KNOW A LOT ABOUT THE SPECIFICS AT RIVERSIDE BUT I IT'S. SEEN AS A BEST PRACTICE BECAUSE IT ALLOWS YOU TO. BRING IN LARGER COHORTS OF APPLICANTS A AND EVEN TO SEE TO FIND. AFFINITIES AMONG APPLICANTS WHO MIGHT MAKE UP OF GOOD COHORT TO BRING TO THE UNIVERSITY. IT'S. THAT. THE RESEARCH IS ON EVEN. ON WHETHER COHORTS ARE THE BEST WAY TO DIVERSIFY THE FACULTY PA IT IT DEPENDS ON MANAGING IT WELL WHICH IS HARD BECAUSE YOU'RE BRINGING. WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS YOU'RE INTERVENING INTO THE STANDARD? DEPARTMENT DECISION MAKING ABOUT WHO. THEY WANT TO CHOOSE AS THEIR NEXT COLLEAGUE AND ACTUALLY IT'S PROBABLY AND IN MANY CASES A GOOD IDEA TO. TO GET PEOPLE TO THINK BEYOND THEIR STANDARD DISCIPLINARY WAYS OF HIRING COLLEAGUES AND TO THINK ACROSS DISCIPLINES WHICH IS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY COSTS ARE HIGHER IS OFTEN DO SUCCEED. IS GOOD IS CLUSTER HIRING OF. LIMITED TO DEPARTMENT OR WOULD IT BE IT WOULD USUALLY BE A COULD BE IN A DEPARTMENT. WAR OF THE SANTA BARBARA PAT. PILOT THIS YEAR IN ECONOMICS HAD THEIR THINKING OF IT AS A CLUSTER HIGHER TO BRING IN PEOPLE WITH CERTAIN KINDS OF. EXPERTISE AND ECONOMICS BUT IT USUALLY. AMONG DEPARTMENTS AND ACROSS DEPARTMENTS AND AGAIN BECAUSE SO MANY OF THAT THE ISSUES. FACULTY. ARE RESEARCHING GO BEYOND A SINGLE DISCIPLINE WHEN WE'RE TRYING TO FIND SOLUTIONS SO IF WE HIRE FACULTY WHO ARE INCLINED TO WORK OUTSIDE A SINGLE DISCIPLINE. WERE MORE LIKELY TO TO MAKE ADVANCES IN THE NOSE SOLVING THE WORLD'S PROBLEMS. I KNOW THAT UC RIVERSIDE RECENTLY. HIRED I THINK. SOMEWHERE BETWEEN FIVE OR SEVEN AT NATIVE AMERICANS OF PROFESSORS AND I THINK THAT WAS IN A MONUMENTAL. A CERTAIN THAT WE WE HADN'T SEEN A ANYWHERE WOULD PROBABLY DON'T SEE IT AT ANY OTHER INSTITUTION. I ALSO READ HERE ARE THE THE. PRACTICE OF ASKING APPLICANTS TO WRITE ABOUT. TALK ABOUT A THEIR EXPERTISE AND IN TEACHING. I BELIEVE YES A THE THE POPULATION THAT THEY ARE TEACHING CAN YOU TALK MORE ABOUT THAT. SURE. NOW ALMOST ALL OF OUR CAMPUSES REQUIRE A ALL FACULTY APPLICANTS TO SUBMIT WHAT WE CALL A CONTRIBUTIONS TO DIVERSITY STATEMENT. AND IT. ENABLES THAT THOSE WHO HAVE DONE WORK IN THEIR TEACHING IN THEIR PRIOR RESEARCH OR EVEN OUTREACH. I TO TO DIVERSE COMMUNITIES TO TALK ABOUT THAT. THE. BUT MANY OF THE PILOTS HAVE MADE A CHANGE IN HOW THEY USE THOSE STATEMENTS WHICH I THINK HAS BEEN EFFECTIVE AND THEY'VE. FACTORED THEIR EVALUATION OF THOSE STATEMENTS ARE EARLY INTO THE PROCESS EARLIER IT RIVERSIDE FOR EXAMPLE IN THE ENGINEERING PILOT LAST YEAR. THAT THE FIRST CUT OF APPLICANTS. FOCUSED ARE MAINLY ON RESEARCH POTENTIAL IN RESEARCH ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND ON CONTRIBUTIONS TO DIVERSITY. AND THAT IS IN LARGE PART WHAT HELP THEM TO TRACK SUCH A. A DIVERSE FINALIST POOL AND THEN A DIVERSE POOL OF HIRES BUT THEY DID SOMETHING SIMILAR AT SAN DIEGO ALSO IN ENGINEERING LAST YEAR WHERE THEY. THAT THE FACULTY WERE TRAINED IN HOW TO READ THESE CONTRIBUTIONS TO DIVERSITY STATEMENTS AND MANY DISCIPLINES THIS IS A NEW. ISSUE. BUT IN A DISPLAY LIKE ENGINEERING IT THAT OFTEN THE FOCUS IS ON TEACHING BECAUSE THAT'S OF A COMPETENCY ALL FACULTY NEED NOW AT THE ABILITY TO TEACH A DIVERSE SET OF STUDENTS. WE NOT TOO FAR BACK HAD A HEARING AT SAN JOSE STATE ON. DIVERSITY OF FACULTY A ACROSS THE THREE SYSTEMS. AND AND I WOULD. AND I REMEMBER. OF ASTRONOMER. OF FROM UC BERKELEY AND HE MADE THE STRONG STATEMENT THAT WE DO NOT HAVE MORE DIVERSITY. AND HIGHER EDUCATION AND HIS STATEMENT WAS BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT TO. SO I I THINK THE WILL AND IT NEEDS TO BE THERE. AND THE PRIORITY NEEDS TO BE GIVEN TO IT. AND AND AGAIN. WE ARE MAKING VERY SLOW PROGRESS. TOWARDS THAT IF WE LOOK FORTY YEARS BACK THE THE THE PERCENTAGES OF. TENURED FACULTY OF COLOR HASN'T CHANGED MUCH AT ALL. AND. IT IS VERY SLOW PROGRESS AND. AGAIN I I WOULD ENCOURAGE UP ALL THREE SYSTEMS TO CONTINUE. TO. TO WORK AT IT. BECAUSE I THINK IT DOES MAKE A DIFFERENCE A TO THE SUCCESS OF OF THE STUDENTS THAT WE'RE WE'RE TEACHING. AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER DFI ME CIRCLE BACK FOR A MOMENT ONE. EXCELLO WHICH YOU ASKED ABOUT. THE DOCUMENT THAT ILLUSTRATES ALL OF THE SUMMARIES OF THE FUNDED PROPOSALS FOR THIS PAST YEAR INCLUDES A FIVE PARAGRAPH ONE SL LOW. AND THEY ARE PROPOSING LAUNCHING A CLUSTER HIGHER FOR TEN DEPARTMENTS TEN FACULTY MEMBER ACROSS DEPARTMENTS AND I ALSO HAVE SOME ADDITIONAL INFORMATION WHICH TALKS ABOUT CLUSTER HIRES THAT WAS THAT THEY HAVE ALREADY DONE. IN THE COLLEGE OF LIBERAL ARTS AND ALSO IN MATH AND SCIENCE ON THIS DOCUMENT CONTAINS OTHER INFORMATION THOUGH SO I CAN PEEL OUT THE SPECIFIC INFORMATION TO PROVIDE TO YOU. THANK YOU YOU'RE WELCOME AND AND I KNOW WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE DISCUSSIONS ON ON THE STOP. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER MARTZ ITCHY THANK YOU VERY MUCH I. THIS A SUBJECT TO. REMINDS ME OF HOW WHEN I WAS A STUDENT AT UCLA LAW SCHOOL WE WOULD BE. ADVOCATING FOR MORE FACULTY DIVERSITY AND. AND WE WOULD HAVE. DEMONSTRATIONS IN PETITIONS. AND THEN WE WILL GET SOMEONE. AND THEN THE RELIEF. SO. THE RETENTION IS THERE SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT ALSO. ESPECIALLY WHERE. IT SEEMS LIKE BECAUSE THE POOL IS SO SMALL THAT. THEY THEY. THE THAT THE TALENTED. FACULTY OF COLOR ARE HIGHLY SOUGHT AFTER ACROSS THE COUNTRY. SO OF FOR ALL THREE SEGMENTS IN THE WATER WHAT ARE THE THEY THAT THEY'RE. THE MOST. SUCCESSFUL OR COMPELLING ARGUMENTS AS TO WHY TO COME AND TO STAY. AT UC CSU ARE ARE ARE CALIFORNIA CAN BE COLLEGES. ORDER AND I WOULD IMAGINE THERE BE WIDE VARIATION A DEPENDING ON THE CAMPUS AND DEPARTMENT AND AND DISCIPLINE IN. IN OUR GREAT RESEARCH FACILITIES. BUTTA ARE IS OUR TH ONE BIG ROTH FLOOR AT DIVERSE FACULTY IS OUR DIVERSE STUDENT BODY OF FACULTY WANT TO WORK WITH OUR STUDENTS AND DAY THEY FIND IT QUITE COMPELLING. TO TO TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO WHICH WE WORK WITH SUCH A DIVERSE STUDENT BODY SO I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY BUT. THE ONE OF THE TOP WAYS WE CAN RECRUIT. AND IT'S. BUT INDEED A GREAT AUNT TOOL THAT WE HAVE. AT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE ALSO FOUND HELPS ONCE WEEK WRITTEN. RECRUIT THOSE FACULTY RETAIN THEM. IS TO BE SURE THEY'RE FINDING THE RIGHT COMMUNITY NOT JUST AMONG THEIR STUDENTS BUT AMONG THEIR PEERS. AND I MENTIONED EARLIER THE PRESIDENT'S POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWS PROGRAM. SIMILAR TO THAT PROGRAM AT CSU WHICH WE'VE HAD FOR OVER THIRTY YEARS AND IT. BRINGS IN A COHORT OF NEW POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWS IN ALL DISCIPLINES. WHEN THAT WE NOW BRING IN ABOUT. OVER THIRTY YEARS WE HAVE ROUGHLY SAY THAT IT'S A TO YOUR PROBLEMS SEVENTY OF THOSE FELLOWS EVERY YEAR AND OVER THIRTY YEARS WE'VE BUILT A COMMUNITY. ACROSS THE SYSTEM AND OUR PRIMARY GOAL FOR RUNNING THAT PROGRAM IS TO RECRUIT THOSE AMAZINGLY TALENTED OF FELLOWS INTO THE FACULTY BUT ONCE THEY GET INTO THE FACT THAT THEY HAVE A READY MADE. NETWORK ACROSS THE SYSTEM. DEAD. ENABLES THEM TO TALK ABOUT WHAT'S NOT GOING SO WELL CRITICALLY WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT AND I'M IN THE POSITION TO EVALUATE THEM. AND THEN WE JUST STARTED. THREE YEARS AGO. A. EXIT AND RETENTION SURVEY OF OUR FACULTY SO THAT WE WOULD HAVE BETTER DATA ON. WHY FACULTY DO LEAVE AND WHY THEY STAY? AND IT'S. OTHER FINDINGS ARE NOT. SO SURPRISING BUT WE ACTUALLY HAVE DATA FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT CONFIRMS. WHAT WE THOUGHT WE KNEW ABOUT WHY FACULTY LEAVING MY THE STATE WHAT WE DON'T HAVE YET BECAUSE THE NUMBERS ARE SMALLER? IT IS THE ABILITY TO. DISAGGREGATED THOSE FINDINGS ACROSS THAT WE CAN DO IT BY GENDER BUT WE CAN'T YET DO IT BY RACE AND ETHNICITY. SO YOU THEIR DATA IS INSUFFICIENT TO. TRY TO. TO DRAW IT TO SAY THAT YOU KNOW WHY WHY DO ARE AFRICAN AMERICAN FACULTY LEAVE OR STAY ONE WHAT'S COMPELLING OR WHY DO AT LATINO FACT BELIEVERS TODAY. UP BUT I CAN TELL YOU ONE ONE OF THE FINDINGS FOR ALL FACULTY AND IS THAT. SALARY MATTERS YOU KNOW THEIR ABILITY TO. LIVE IN IN OUR STATE. IS A BIG ISSUE FOR. THE FACULTY BUT THE QUALITY OF THEIR STUDENTS AND COLLEAGUES IS RIGHT THERE AS WELL. AND I WOULD ALMOST ECHO EVERYTHING THAT MY COLLEAGUE SHARED AS WELL ON TO MY EARLIER COMMENT ABOUT HIRING SOMEONE IS JUST THE FIRST STEP IN AND PAYING A LOT MORE ATTENTION FOCUSED ON INCLUSION AND WHY PEOPLE ARE LEAVING. ON OUR CAMPUSES ARE DOING A BETTER JOB I'M A GREAT JOB ON MOST OF THE BUILDING COMMUNITIES OF SUPPORT NOT ONLY FOR THE FACULTY MEMBER BUT ALSO FOR THE FAMILY AND AND FILLED. HER THE TROOP COMMUNITY IN THAT AREA THEY LIVE IN A BUT WE CERTAINLY HAVE CHALLENGES WITH SALARIES. AND THE COST OF LIVING. WE ALL KNOW WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE AND SO THAT'S THAT'S A LARGE PIECE OF COMING OF OUR PRELIMINARY DATA AS WELL. PA BUT THERE AND AT BUT CERTAINLY THE MISSION AND THE THE STE THE STUDENT POPULATION I THINK IS IS PROBABLY THE NUMBER ONE REASON THE MOST TO DO STAY INTERESTED. AGAIN IT WOULD BE FOR THE COMMUNICATIVE SYSTEM CERTAINLY THE MISSION OF THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES. AND THE INCREDIBLY DIVERSE STUDENT BODY THAT WE SERVE SO I WOULD I WOULD POINT OUT AS FAR AS THE IMPORTANCE OF OF RETENTION AND IT'S IT'S A CENTRAL BECAUSE AS YOU POINTED OUT THERE'S. GETTING SOMEONE THE DOORS ONE THING BUT IF YOU CAN'T KEEP THEM. THEN YOU HAVEN'T YOU HAVEN'T GOTTEN ANYWHERE SO THREE OF THE NINE MULTIPLE METHODS THAT WE USE THAT THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE FOR ALLOCATING  <u>&lt;c.green&gt;O. FUNDING&lt;/c&gt;</u> RELATE TO. A POST HIRING AND RETENTION. IN THE INCLUDE. WHETHER OUR DISTRICTS HAVE A PROFESSIONAL DO WELL DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS ARE FOCUSED ON DIVERSITY. WHETHER A DIVERSITY IS INCORPORATED INTO CRITERIA FOR EMPLOYEE EVALUATION AND TENURE REVIEW WHICH I THINK IS ACTUALLY A VERY INTERESTING ONE. AT THE HAS TO BE NEGOTIATED LOCAL WE. WITH. WITH UNIONS. AND THEN. GROW YOUR OWN PROGRAMS WE'VE. WE'VE HAD A A FLOWERING OF. MENTORSHIP PROGRAMS ARE FOCUSED ON DIVERSITY THAT ARE. AIMS TO DO JUST THAT IS TO RETAIN UR OUR DIVERSE FACULTY. ALRIGHT AND. ONE LAST QUESTION I I. I KNOW THAT. ASIANS. CAN SOMETIMES BE INCLUDED AND AND THESE DIVERSITY PROGRAMS AND SOMETIMES ARE NOT. SEVERAL MENTIONED AT DIFFERENT TIMES UNDER REPRESENTED MINORITY. DO YEAR DIVERSE CITY. RECRUITMENT EFFORTS TARGET ASIANS. AND THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION SO SO WHEN WE USE UNDERREPRESENTED MINORITY AT YOU SEE WE DO MEAN. DE. AFRICAN AMERICAN AND LATINO AND NATIVE AMERICAN. BUT WE OFTEN ALSO TALK ABOUT. FACULTY OF COLOR AND AND IT REALLY VARIES BY DISCIPLINE. HOW REPRESENTED ARE UNDERREPRESENTED SHUTTLE OTHER FACULTY OF COLOR ARE INCLUDING ASIAN? I KNOW DAVIS ONE OF THEIR CONCERNS HAS BEEN. EVEN SUBPOPULATIONS OF GOODNESS A LOT OF THINGS THAT YOU KNOW I GET FOLDED INTO ASIAN SUB SUB AGE PERCEPTIBLY LESIONS OF. ASIAN. FACULTY ARE VERY IMPORTANT TO THEM AGAIN BECAUSE THEY STUDENTS ARE. CONCERNED THAT THEY'RE NOT SEEING A ASIAN FACULTY ON TEACHING THEIR COURSE ISN'T IN CERTAIN DISCIPLINES. SO. IF IT HASN'T BEEN A FOCUS OF THIS PROGRAM BUT IT'S SOMETHING WE CERTAINLY TRACK. EFFECT WE TRACK. IT'S AVAILABLE IN OUR. INFORMATION CENTER ONLINE. FACULTY. WE HAVE YOU KNOW OUT. A WHITE FACULTY ASIAN FACULTY AND DIE UNDER REPRESENTED CATEGORIES OF AFRICAN AMERICAN LATINO AND NATIVE AMERICAN BUT WE ALSO TO SEGREGATE BY. US CITIZENSHIP STATUS. BECAUSE IT'S IT'S IT'S ANOTHER WAY OF THINKING ABOUT WHO ARE FACULTY ARE AT YOU SEE NEARLY A QUARTER OF THE FACULTY ARE. NOT CITIZENS OF THIS COUNTRY SO. WE HAD IT TELLS YOU SOMETHING ABOUT THE BACH COMMUNITY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. AND THE IMPORTANCE OF CONNECTING ARTS HUMANITIES AT THE UNIVERSITY TO COMMUNITIES AROUND THE WORLD. YES WE DO INCLUDE ASIAN AND. THOUGH THE PIE CHART ON THE HAND OUT. ACTUALLY ILLUSTRATES A I'M. A FAIRLY SIGNIFICANT CHANGE ON IT WE WENT FROM TWENTY THREE POINT SIX PERCENT AND SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN AND HAVE A DROPPED A TWENTY TWO AND A HALF PERCENT SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN. BUT THE FOR EIGHTEEN NINETEEN MORE SEEING TWENTY SEVEN POINT TWO SO THIRSTY THIRST ON SOME IMPROVEMENT IN THAT AREA. THAT SHOW I THINK WE'RE QUITE A QUITE OUR INITIATIVES HAVING AN IMPACT. AND FOR THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM. SIMILAR TO THE UC OUR OUR CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE DEFINITION OF UNDERREPRESENTED MINORITY INCLUDES UP BLACK HISPANIC. AND NATIVE AMERICAN PACIFIC ISLANDER. BUT AS FAR AS THE USE OF THE FUNDING TO OUR LOCAL DISTRICTS. OF THAT THE FUNDING ABSOLUTELY THAT CAN BE USED FOR THAT THE RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION OF OF OF ASIAN FACULTY FOR CLASSIFIED STUFF. IT REALLY DOES VERY REGION TO REGION WITHIN THE STATE AND WITH THE NEEDS. AND THE DEMOGRAPHICS OF OUR VARIOUS LOCAL DISTRICTS ARE. YEAH THANK YOU I I WOULD JUST CLOSE BY THAT YOU KNOW. REITERATING. A POINT THAT I THINK SOMEONE MADE EARLIER THAT THAT. THERE ARE DEPARTMENTS WHERE ASIANS. MAY BE UNDERREPRESENTED WHERE MAYBE DIFFICULT TO. HAVE. ASIAN LAW PROFESSORS. WORD THEY MAY BE OVER REPRESENTED RELATIVE THE STUDENT POPULATION AND COLLEGES OF ENGINEERING AND SO. LIKE. NAM WHICH IS ASK OF DATA. ASIANS NOT BE CATEGORICALLY EXCLUDED. OKAY. THANK YOU. THIS WAS THE INFORMATION ON THIS HELPED INFORM INFORM US ABOUT THAT. DECISIONS WE MADE THE PAST TWO YEARS AND THAT ONE TO HAVE FOLLOW UP DISCUSSION OF COURSE AND AND AS WELL WILL CONSIDER. OF THESE ISSUES FOR POTENTIAL INCLUSION IN THE TWENTY. EIGHTEEN BUDGET ACT. THIS IS NO ACTION ITEM ON THIS ISSUE THANK YOU FOR THE PRESENTATION. THANK YOU. WITH THAT WE WILL NOW PROCEED WITH PUBLIC COMMENTS. PUBLIC COMMENTS. PLEASE LINE UP IN THE MIDDLE. THE MICROPHONE. IT'S COMING AROUND HIM AGAIN PLEASE AS USUAL KEEP YOUR COMMENTS TO ONE MINUTE OR LESS SIXTY SECONDS OR LESS. MORNING WITH A BASKET RESEARCH RESEARCH ANALYST ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA FACULTY ASSOCIATION I'D LIKE TO PROVIDE SOME ADDITIONAL CONTEXT ON RACIAL AND ETHNIC DIVERSITY WITHIN THE CSU. THE ANALYSIS PROVIDED BY THE CSU IN FACT WE HAVE A MAJORITY OF CSU FACULTY WHICH INCLUDE LECTURES MENTAL HEALTH COUNSELORS LIBRARIANS COACHES ALL WHO SERVE STUDENTS ON A DAILY BASIS. LECTURES WHO MAKE UP OVER HALF OF THE INSTRUCTIONAL FACULTY WITHIN THE CSU ART BACK LEST RACIAL AND ETHNIC WE DIVERSE BAND TENURE LINE FACULTY. OVER THE LAST THIRTY YEARS NUMBER TENURE LINE FACULTY HAVE IN FACT REMAINED ESSENTIALLY FLAT. ID SPEAKING TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER MEDINA'S POINT IN THE CSU SYSTEM FOR EVERYONE LATINO LATINA FACULTY MEMBER THERE NINETY SEVEN LATINO LATINA STUDENTS IN CONTRAST FOR EVERYONE WHITE FACULTY MEMBER THERE ARE NINE WHITE STUDENTS. OF THE MORE THAN FOUR HUNDRED AND EIGHTY THOUSAND STUDENTS IN THE CSU SYSTEM THREE OF OUT OF FOR IDENTIFIES STUDENTS OF COLOR. AND FOR THE FACULTY OF COLOR WHO SUPPORT THEM WHO WERE UNDER REPRESENTED ON OUR CAMPUSES. THE EXPECTATIONS TO SERVE THEM WEARING AN INCREASED BURDEN ON THEIR DAY TO DAY WORKLOAD BECOME ONLY REFER TO THIS AS CULTURAL TAXATION AND THEY DO THIS WORK EVERY DAY. THIS ISSUE CAN CANNOT EXPLAINS CANNOT ADDRESS THE UNDER REPRESENTATION OF FACULTY OF COLOR ON OUR CAMPUSES WITHOUT ADDRESSING THE PROBLEM OF TENURE DENSITY. THE FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS AND DEDICATED FUNDING FOR TENURE LINE HIRING THAT CFA IS ADVOCATING FOR WOULD DEVOTE MUCH NEEDED RESOURCES TO THIS ISSUE WOULD ALLOW THE CSU TO BEGIN MAKING REAL CHANGES TO ENSURE STUDENTS HAVE ACCESS TO TENURED FACULTY. AND INCREASING THE NUMBER OF TENURE LINE FACULTY OF COLOR THANK YOU. IF YOU. HI MY NAME IS DOCTOR DENISE DAWKINS. WHAT I NOTICED HERE WAS THE PEOPLE SITTING HERE WERE NOT DIVERSE IN IT WOULD REALLY HELP IF THEY WERE I AM A TENURE TRACK FACULTY AT CALIFORNIA STATE BAKERSFIELD I'M IN THE NURSING DEPARTMENT? AND NOBODY TALKS ABOUT NURSING AND WE HAVE THE HIGHEST. WE HAVE THE HIGHEST. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT FEMALES PLEASE DON'T THROW WITHIN WITH PEOPLE OF UNDER REPRESENTED COLOR BECAUSE THE NURSING THAT'S NOT THE ISSUE. I HAVE WORKED MY CAMPUS IS PROBABLY FORTY PROBABLY FIFTY SIX FIFTY PERCENT OR MORE HISPANIC WE HAVE NO HISPANIC FACULTY. ON THE ONLY BLACK BACK FULL TIME BLACK FACULTY SO I WANT YOU TO KEEP THAT I AM PART OF THE I WAS ONE OF THE ON DOCTOR CANDIDATES FROM THE AYE CHANCELLORS ON PROGRAM THAT HELPED. AND I'M REALLY PROUD TO SAY THAT BUT THE RETENTION SUCKS SORRY AND I THINK THAT YOU NEED TO HEAR FROM FACULTY OF COLOR OF HOW TO RECRUIT FACULTY. AND ON HOW TO ON RETAIN FACULTY AND. MR MEDINA I'M IN LOVE WITH YOU THANK YOU FOR YOUR WHAT YOU SAID DON'T TELL YOUR WIFE. YOU. I. AT SYNDICATE STILL BEHALF OF THE FACULTY ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES WE'VE LONG ADVOCATED FOR A DIVERSE FACULTY POPULATION THAT REPRESENTS THE COMMUNITIES THAT THEY SERVE WE BELIEVE THIS IS CRITICAL AND SHOULD BE A SYSTEM PRIORITY HOWEVER. IN ORDER TO ALLOW AN INFLUX OF DIVERSE CANDIDATES THERE MUST BE ATTRACTIVE POSITIONS AVAILABLE. WHEN THE ENTRY POINT INTO OUR SYSTEM IS A PART TIME ASSIGNMENT WITH LITTLE JOB SECURITY AND LITTLE PAY WILL FAIL TO RECRUIT. QUALIFIED INDIVIDUALS FROM DIVERSE BACKGROUNDS. WE MUST PAY SERIOUS ATTENTION TO THIS ONE US ANY FIVE TWENTY FIVE FULL TIME TO PART TIME FACULTY RATIO. AND OUR CURRENT OVER RELIANCE ON PART TIME FACULTY. SACKING URGES THE MULTI YEAR COMMITMENT TO DEDICATED FUNDING FOR FULL TIME FACULTY HIRING AND A DEGREE PIPELINE THROUGH THE CSU THAT WOULD ENCOURAGE STUDENTS TO RETURN TO THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES TO TEACH. LASTLY WE'RE IN FULL SUPPORT OF THE HUNGER FREE CAMPUS PROGRAM ENCOURAGE TENSION TO THESE VITAL PROGRAMS THANK YOU.

GOOD MORNING AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME TODAY MY NAME'S HERSELF UNA AND I'M A FIRST YEAR AT UC BERKELEY. PERSONALLY EARNING ACCEPTANCE AT UC BERKELEY I THOUGHT THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE WOULD BE THE ACADEMIC RIGOR. BUT INSTEAD TO MY SURPRISE IT'S FIGHTING TO STAY IN THIS INCREASINGLY EXPENSIVE SYSTEM BY SACRIFICING BASIC NEEDS FOR LIKE FOOD AND HOUSING SECURITY JUST TO PAY FOR MY SCHOOL. IT'S CHOOSING BETWEEN ADEQUATE NUTRITION AND THE SEMESTERS COURSE READERS IT'S STRUGGLING TO BE ACTIVELY PRESENT ON AN EMPTY STOMACH IT'S TRYING TO BE ACADEMICALLY COMPETITIVE EVEN WHEN. MY BODY IS STRUGGLING TO KEEP UP WITH MY MIND. THANK YOU TO THE MEMBERS WERE ALREADY SUPPORTING OUR BUDGET THE NEED FOR MORE INVESTMENT. BUT WE ARE LOOKING TO THE REST OF YOU OUR STATE LEGISLATORS TO MAKE HIGHER EDUCATION TO PROVIDE A PRIORITY IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET CYCLE AND SUPPORT OUR ONE HUNDRED FORTY MILLION DOLLAR BUDGET ASK. THINK. HELLO I'M MY NAME IS ANNA WHITNEY FROM OUT OF STATE STUDENT AT UC BERKELEY WHO WAS RECENTLY ELECTED TO REPRESENT. OUR STUDENT BODY IN OUR STUDENTS SENATE. I'M HERE TO URGE YOU TO FILL THE UNIVERSITY. OF CALIFORNIA STUDENT ASSOCIATIONS BUDGET ASKS. BY TWENTY TWENTY EMPLOYMENT EXPERTS PREDICT THAT SIXTY FIVE PERCENT OF JOBS WILL REQUIRE POST HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION. RIGHT NOW UNEMPLOYMENT IS TWICE AS HIGH FOR HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES THAN IT IS FOR PEOPLE WITH COLLEGE DEGREES. THE EARNING DIFFERENTIAL BETWEEN COLLEGE AND HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES HAS DOUBLED SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY. IT IS CLEAR THAT A COLLEGE DEGREE IS IN DEMAND IN OUR ECONOMY AND AS A TOOL FOR ECONOMIC COMPARTMENT. SO WHO IS MOSTLY BENEFITING FROM THESE DECREES EXPENSIVE DEGREES PEOPLE WHO CAN PAY FOR THEM PEOPLE WHO ARE TO COME FROM WEALTH. OUR HIGH TUITION HIRED SYSTEM DOESN'T DO ENOUGH TO SERVE MIDDLE INCOME FAMILIES WHO DON'T QUALIFY FOR AID. PEOPLE WHOSE AID DOES NOT COVER THEIR LIVING COSTS AND PEOPLE WHO DON'T ENROLL TO BEGIN WITH BECAUSE THEY'RE INTENDED BY THE PRICE. WITH EACH TUITION HIKE OUR SCHOOLS BECOME LESS DIVERSE LESS EXCELLENT AND MUST JUST. THERE'S NO SUBSTITUTION TO REDUCING THE NET COST OF A DEGREE OVERALL. EVERY YEAR WERE CHOOSING TO ENROLL MORE AND MORE PEOPLE. BUT WE'RE NOT CHOOSING TO INCREASE INVESTMENT AT THE RATE AT WHICH WE ARE INCREASING ENROLLMENT. IF WE WANT EVERYONE TO BE READY FOR TODAY'S ECONOMY AND FOR TOMORROW'S ECONOMY WE CANNOT CONTINUE WITH THIS DISINVESTMENT. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR TIME MY NAME IS TIMOTHY EITHER I'M A FRESHMAN AT UC BERKELEY. FOR A LOT OF FRESHMEN LIKE ME TODAY IS PHASE ONE OF CLASS REGISTRATION. BUT FRANKLY CLASS REGISTRATION IS IN THE MOST PRESSING HER IMPORTANT THING. A LOT OF STUDENTS MINDS. AS MY PEERS BEFORE ME HAVE ATTESTED TIME AND TIME AGAIN. ANDTHE OVERWHELMING BUDGET OF TUITION OWED BURDEN OF TUITION REQUIRE STUDENTS TO SACRIFICE BASIC NEEDS. TO KEEP ATTENDING SCHOOL STUDENTS ARE WORRYING ABOUT HALF TO FIND SOMETHING TO EAT OR A PLACE TO SAY. I DOUBT THEY'RE FOCUSING ON WHETHER OR NOT THEY'LL BE ABLE TO FIT THAT MATH CLASSOF THE NEED TO TAKE TO GRADUATE INTO THEIR SCHEDULE FOR NEXT SEMESTER. IT'S DISHEARTENING THAT DURING MY TIME AT THE FLAGSHIP UNIVERSITY OF THE YOU SEE I'VE SEEN SO MANY STUDENTS STRUGGLING TO STAY AFLOAT AND THE OVERWHELMING BURDEN OF TUITION CERTAINLY. DOESN'T MAKE THOSE WATERS CALMER. THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE TODAY-WHILE CLASS REGISTRATION IS OCCURRING AND WHILE FINALS ARE APPROACHING WE RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS. WOULD AGAIN LIKE TO THANK ALL OF THE LEGISLATURE'S TO THE BILL OF THE LEGISLATORS WHO HAVE. SUPPORTED I ASK FOR ONE HUNDRED FORTY MILLION DOLLARS BUT. TO THOSE WHO HAVEN'T YOU'VE HEARD THE STATISTICS OU'RE CONTINUING TO HEAR OUR STORIES WE NEED SUFFICIENT FUNDING FOR THE UC SYSTEM THANK YOU AGAIN FOR YOUR TIME. GOOD AFTERNOON I'M ASSEMBLY MEMBERS ON MEN COME FROM. I SAID IN A UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SANTA CRUZ AND. OUT ALONG BELABORED POINT. Y'ALL HEARD A STATISTIC YA HEARD AUG TESTIMONY FROM ALL STUDENT.

AND I'M IMPLORE ALICE LATER TO DO THE RIGHT THING AND TO HAVE PROBABLY FUND. YOU SEE AND NOT PUT A FINANCIAL BURDEN. THAT COST BIDEN ADMINISTRATION ON JUST THAT THANK YOU. HELLO JARED KELLER ASSISTANT DIRECTOR INFRASTRUCTURE THE SACRAMENTO PUBLIC LIBRARY AND TODAY I'M HERE TO ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT OF CONTINUED FUNDING FOR A CALIFORNIA PUBLIC LIBRARIES TO AYE REMAIN CONNECTED TO SCENIC. SCENIC HAS BEEN A GAME CHANGER FOR CALIFORNIA PUBLIC LIBRARIES AND ESPECIALLY THE SACRAMENTO PUBLIC LIBRARY. PARTY CONNECTED TO SCENIC WE LABOR TO PRY CONNECTIVITY TAR TWENTY EIGHT LOCATION. AS A RESULT OF CONNECTING TO SCENIC WE'RE NOW ABLE WHEAT AS OF TODAY WE PROVIDE GIGABIT CONNECTIVITY TO TWENTY TWO OUT OF TWENTY LOCATIONS WILL BE CONNECTING THE REMAINING SIX. NEXT FISCAL YEAR WITH THIS IS DONE FOR US IS IT'S BEEN ABLE TO PROVIDE US UNLIMITED ACCESS. IN COMMUNITIES WHERE IT'S DEFINITELY NEEDED IT'S ALSO GIVEN US AN OPPORTUNITY TO RETHINK PROGRAMMING. AND THINK ABOUT PROGRAM IN TERMS OF TO BE STRAINED SO NOW WE ARE ABLE TO HELP BRIDGE DISTANCE AND BRIDGE GAPS BY CREATING DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING TO HELP ON KIDS PROGRAM. HOW TO LEARN TO THREE D. MODEL ANTI THIS BASICALLY ANYWHERE THAT THEY CAN HAVE AN ACTIVITY IN ONE OF OUR BRANCHES SO THIS IS ABOUT TRANSFORM LIBRARY SERVICES?

AN URBAN RURAL AND SUBURBAN LIBRARY SYSTEM. SCENIC HAS MADE A TREMENDOUS DIFFERENCE. CHIU EVERYTHING THAT WE'RE ABLE TO DO FOR OUR COMMUNITY. THE OTHER PIECE OF THIS IS WHAT WE'RE ABLE TO DO THROUGH OUR ADULT LITERACY PROGRAM. EXPANDED SUPPORT FOR LITERACY PROGRAMS TO THE STATE LIBRARY WILL IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO REACH THE VERY YOUNGEST OF OUR RESIDENTS THROUGH OUR EARLY LITERACY EFFORTS. AS WELL AS THE ADULTS THAT WE SERVE THROUGH OUR BASIC LITERACY GED PREP ESL PROGRAMS AND CAREER ONLINE HIGH SCHOOL. ABOUT NINETY PERCENT OF OUR CAREER ONLINE HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES GO ON TO HIGHER EDUCATION IT'S A WONDERFUL SAFETY NET THAT THEY'RE ABLE TO EXPERIENCE THROUGH THEIR LOCAL LIBRARY. WHICH HAS. WHICH IS A LITTLE LESS ATTEMPT INTIMIDATING THEN THROUGH MORE TRADITIONAL MEANS OF HIGHER EDUCATION THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. GOOD MORNING CHAIR OAK AFTERNOON WENT CHAIR MCCARTY AND HONORABLE MEMBERS A. MY NAME IS AMY HEINZ SHAIKEN I AM THE HIGHER EDUCATION DIRECTOR FOR THE RE CLAIMS CA HIGHER EDUCATION COALITION. A REGARDING THE SUBJECT OF FACULTY DIVERSITY. WE STRONGLY ECHO THE. SENTIMENTS OF FACT IN MAINTAINING AT NOTATION ON THE SEVENTY FIVE TWENTY FIVE FULL TIME TO PART TIME RATIO. AND ALSO CONSIDERING HIRING THE NON TENURED FACULTY INTO TENDERED POSITIONS THE NON TENURED FACULTY TENDS TO BE MORE DIVERSE AND IT WOULD BE A VERY IMPORTANT MOVEMENT IF WE COULD FIND SOME PATHWAYS TO MOVE THE NON TENURED FACULTY INTO LETTER RATE FACULTY POSITIONS. ALSO THE REKLAME CA HIGHER EDUCATION COALITION HAS A POLICY POSITION PAPER THAT MOST OF YOU HAVE SEEN. ITS TITLE THE SIXTY SIX DOLLARS PICKS UP RENAMED AFTER THE FORTY EIGHT HOUR FIX ALSO INCLUDED THE PROP NINETY EIGHT GUARANTEES AND. IN THIS PAPER SHOULD WE CHOOSE TO USE THIS FUNDING MECHANISM TO DEFRAY TUITION AND FEES ALSO IT ALLOWS US TO FREEZE THAT STUDENT AID COMMISSIONS BUDGET THEREBY ADDING TWO BILLION DOLLARS APPROXIMATELY FOR THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION. TO NOT HAVE TO DEFRAY TUITION AND FEES AND INSTEAD TO GO TOWARD SURVIVAL COSTS THINK YOU. CAN LUIS REPRESENTING SCENIC HERE IN SUPPORT OF THE ENTIRE LIBRARY PROJECT PACKAGE BEFORE YOU AND I THINK PART IN A FINANCE IN THE STATE LABOR FOR WORKING WITH US THIS FALL IN THE LIBRARY ASSOCIATION. TO PUT TOGETHER THE WHOLE THING THAT'S IN FRONT OF YOU TODAY TO REALLY CONTINUE THE WORK OF BRINGING TWENTY LIBRARIES AND TWENTY FIRST CENTURY. TODAY WE ARE ON TRACK TOHAVE A HUNDRED FORTY FUTURE STICTION THAT OF THE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY THREE. AND SEVEN HUNDRED EIGHTY SEVEN BRANCHES OUT OF THE ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE BRANCHES TO BE CONNECTED ON PROCESS OF CONNECTING.

GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS ANGIE CHEN AND I'M A SECOND YEAR STUDENT AT UC BERKELEY I'M HERE TO URGE YOU TO SUPPORT THE EASY BUDGET ASK OF A HUNDRED FORTY MILLION ADDITIONAL FUNDING. AYE THOSE YOU GET THE UC BERKELEY FOOD PANTRY LAST SEMESTER AND I GOT TO INTERACT WITH THE FORTY TWO PERCENT OF STUDENTS WHO IT SO WE EXPERIENCE WITH INSECURITY. THE STUDENTS ARE TRANSFER STUDENTS THEY ARE PEOPLE OF COLOR THEY ARE FIRST GENERATION COLLEGE STUDENTS AND THEIR STUDENT PARENTS THESE OTHER PEOPLE DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED BY BASIC NEEDS AND SECURITY. WE TALK A LOT ABOUT THEM PARTS OF CAMPUS DIVERSITY BUT WHAT'S REALLY CRUCIAL IS ACTUALLY FUNDING ADVERSITY AND THIS INCLUDES FUNDING FOR INITIATIVES SUCH AS THE HUNGER FREAKS CAMPUS PROGRAM SO THAT STUDENTS FROM ALL BACKGROUNDS CAN FOCUS ON GETTING THE DEGREE. RATHER THAN WORRYING ABOUT WHETHER GOING TO GET THEIR NEXT MEAL FROM. FOOD SECURITY IN EFFORTS MUST BE EXPANDED AND KOREANS WITH IT WILL INCREASES. THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA EDUCATES NINE THOUSAND MORE STUDENTS THAN IT DID IN THE YEAR TWO THOUSAND THE STATE FUNDING HAS REMAINED THE SAME. AND THIS DOESN'T JUSTIFY STUDENTS BASIC NEEDS INSUFFICIENT FUNDS ALSO IMPACT COURSE AVAILABILITY BECAUSE AVAILABILITY STUDENT TO FACULTY RATIO ON THE QUALITY OF MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. SO IF STATE INVESTMENT HIGHER EDUCATION IS INADEQUATE THE FINANCIAL BURDEN FALLS ON STUDENTS AND WE CAN'T AFFORD THAT PLEASE WORK WITH US TO FULLY FUND THE UC THINKING. HELLO EVERYONE THAT YOU SO MUCH FOR STAYING TO HEAR ALL THE PUBLIC COMMENTARY MILLION IS A LOT THAT YOU ALL MAY TIME TO HEAR US. NOMINEE MUST GUY ALLEN AND A GRADUATING SENIOR AT UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA RIVERSIDE. I WANT TO TALK TODAY A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE DISPARITY BETWEEN THE STUDENT AND FACULTY IN TERMS OF DIVERSITY. SO USE YOUR PAGES ALL THE TIME FOR BEING THE MOST DIVERSE YOU SEE AND WE ARE IN TERMS OF STUDENTS. NEARLY NINETY PERCENT OF STUDENTS AT OUR SCHOOL ARE NOT DO NOT IDENTIFY AS WHITE BUT NEARLY EIGHTY PERCENT OF THE FACULTY TO YOU. SO THAT IS A SIGNIFICANT DISPARITY IN GRANTED THE FACULTY MEMBERS COME FROM. THE TWENTY THIRTEEN TWENTY FOURTEEN SCHOOL YEAR I KNOW THERE'S BEEN PUSHES TO HAVE MORE DIVERSITY. BUT THAT THAT THE US IS THE DISPARITY THAT GREAT DOES NOT GO AWAY WITHIN FOUR YEARS. I'VE BEEN IN ADDITION TO PROFESSORS I WANT ALSO CALL ATTENTION TO THE OTHER FACULTY ON CAMPUS THAT COULD IMPACT SO IN TERMS OF MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. IF TACKLE IF PROFESSORS DON'T EVEN REPRESENT THE STUDENT HOW CAN I MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES REFLECT THOSE STUDENTS AND IF THOSE SERVICES DON'T REFLECT THE STUDENTS AND STUDENTS OF A COMFORTABLE COMING UP TO THINK THAT THEY'RE EXPERIENCING. SOME YOU HAVE THINGS THAT THIS OF YOU HAVE SITUATIONS OF THAT GREAT OF A DISPARITY YOU HAVE THINGS FOR STUDENTS ARE FEELING TOKEN DOWN THERE SOME OTHER SUPPOSED FILM POWER YOU HAVE THINGS WHERE. STUDENTS ARE FEELING LIKE THEY HAVE THIS IMPOSTOR SYNDROME BECAUSE THEY FEEL LIKE THE THE FIRST TO BE EMPOWERED IN THIS PLACE TO GET A HIGHER EDUCATION TO. TO PURSUE BETTER THINGS FOR THEMSELVES AND FOR THEIR FUTURE BUT THEY DON'T FEEL SUPPORTED BY THIS THE SYSTEM THAT'S POSTED EMPOWERING THEM. SO I REALLY HOPE THAT WE CAN THINK ABOUT THESE THINGS IN THE GRAND SCHEME OF THINGS BECAUSE YOU KNOW LIKE ISN'T UP FOR SCHOOL AND VICE VERSA. SO I STUDENTS ARE GOING THROUGH SCHOOL UNDER DEALING WITH THE THINGS LIKE FOOD INSECURITY LIKE AND ACCESSIBLE HOUSING LIKE AFFORDABLE HOUSING THERE ALSO DEALING WITH MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES. AND ALL OF THESE THINGS ON TOP OF EACH OTHER IN ADDITION TO HOW EXPENSIVE COLLEGES NOT HAVING THE SUPPORT. OF FACULTY BY THE PROFESSORS OR COUNSELORS OR OTHER THINGS LIKE THAT THAT REFLECT THEM I CAN EMPATHIZE THEM TO THE UNDERSTAND THE LINGUISTIC BARRIERS AND THE CULTURAL BARRIERS AND ETHNICITY THINGS. ALL OF THOSE THINGS MATTER AND ALL THOSE THINGS SHOULD HAVE A PART IN THIS CONVERSATIONS OF THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME AND THANK YOU FOR STAYING IN THE COUNTRY. SORRY ARM. MY NAME IS TOUGH CON I'M A SOPHOMORE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF. CALIFORNIA BERKELEY. FROM AN EARLY AGE WE ARE TAUGHT THAT LIKE. WE NEED TO PURSUE A COLLEGE DEGREE IN SCHOOL. BUT ONCE WE GET HERE OF WE PUMMELED BY HUGE DEBTS AND. I LIKE HIGH TUITION FEES. I PERSON WILL COME OUT WITH ALMOST. THIRTY EIGHT THOUSAND DOLLARS IN LOANS. I THAT IN STATE STUDENT AT THE END OF MY TIME AT THAT BERKELEY. IT'LL BE COULD BE MORE END OF DEPENDING ON THE CUTS. BOB IN THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION. LIKE RUBIN SAID TODAY OUR STUDENTS HAVE TO WORK HARDER AND GO OUT STRUGGLE MORE. TO GET THROUGH A. THEIR TIME AT SCHOOL.

IF YOU. HI EVERYONE MY NAME IS A DAVID LYNCH FILM WITH THEIR YOUR UC RIVERSIDE. WITH THE CONTINUE DISINVESTMENT BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FOR WITH THE CCC CSU AND YOU SEE MORE AND MORE OF THE BURDEN COST OF EDUCATIONAL FONG STUDENTS SOME CREAMER FINANCIAL HARDSHIP. AS IT STANDS FOOD INSECURITY IS ARAMBULA YOU SEE US CAMPUS IS WELL AS OTHER UC CAMPUSES. I MUST OFFERED HAVE HAD THE PRIVILEGE. OF NOT EXPERIENCE X. EXPERIENCING EXTREME FOOD INSECURITY. BUT I'M HERE BECAUSE I WILL NOT STAY SILENT WHILE OTHER MY PEERS BACK IN RIVERSIDE ANOTHER UC CAMPUSES. A GO HUNGRY. ON THE TOPIC OF FACULTY MINORITY REPRESENTATION I HAVE PERSONALLY HAD POSITIVE EXPERIENCES WITH THE LATINO LATINA. FACULTY ARE YOU SEE ARE WHO HAVE HELPED ME LEARN NEW SKILLS AND GROW THE STUDENT.

MOVING FORWARD I ALSO WANT TO TALK ABOUT PUTTING SECURITY MOST CAMPUSES HAVE FOOD PANTRIES AND THAT'S GREAT BUT WE NEED TO DO MORE. I PERSONALLY KNOW STUDENTS WHO HAVE TO DECIDE BETWEEN TEXTBOOKS OR FOOD EVER IN A COURT OF SYSTEM IS SUCKS BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO MAKE THAT CHOICE THREE TIMES. USUALLY THE FIRST TWO WEEKS OF EACH CORNER ARE THE WORST. MY FIRST YEAR AT THE SUCH STRUGGLE EITHER I. GOOD MONEY FOR GROCERIES OR I GOT MY BOOKS. I USUALLY NEVER BOUGHT THE BOOKS WHICH OF COURSE AFFECTED MY ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE BECAUSE NOT EVERY PROFESSOR PUT THE BOOK ON RESERVE. AND.

THERE'S NO DOUBT BEEN A CONCERNING WAYS TO FUNDS COMING OUT OF YOU CO PI THINK WE SAW THAT FROM THE AUDIT. HOWEVER THE REALITY IS THAT IT'S TIME TO STOP PLAYING HOT POTATO WHILE CAMPUS IS LIKE UC BERKELEY ARE LITERALLY FALLING APART. THE RECENT CHANGE IN THE UC REGENTS MENTALITY OF NOT EVEN CONSIDERING TUITION HIKES THIS COMING MAY IS IMPAIRED IF I IT'S A POINT OF CAPITALIZATION. IT SHOULD BE SEEN AS A HISTORIC MOMENT IT'S WHERE FOLKS WILL BE ABLE TO LOOK BACK AND SEE THE UNPRECEDENTED EFFORTS OF STUDENTS TO GIVE BACK TO THEIR COMMUNITIES. BUT IT WILL ONLY TRULY BE WORTH CELEBRATING IF ALL OF YOU CAN DO YOUR PART ENSURING OUR EFFORTS COME TO FRUITION.
