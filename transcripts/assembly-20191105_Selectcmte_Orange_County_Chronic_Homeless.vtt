CHAIR OF THIS COMMITTEE AND

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:46.933
WITH THAT THE PRIMARY REASON

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.702
IS SO THAT WE CAN IDENTIFY NOT

00:03:46.192 --> 00:03:47.460
THE REGION HAS MADE OVER THE

00:03:47.527 --> 00:03:49.429
LAST YEAR AND WHAT WE NEED TO

SIMPLE FIX IT'S NOT EASY IT'S

00:04:05.278 --> 00:04:07.614
COMPLEX AND OF WHAT I WILL

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:12.352
ABSOLUTELY NOT EVEN TAKE AS A

00:04:12.418 --> 00:04:15.688
SOLUTION IS LET'S BUS EVERYBODY

CAN ALL DEAL WITH THAT SEE

00:04:22.996 --> 00:04:27.433
THAT'S NOT A SOLUTION -- BUT TO

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:29.902
SOLVE THIS IT TAKES DEDICATION

00:04:29.969 --> 00:04:31.804
IT TAKES COLLABORATION AND

00:04:31.871 --> 00:04:34.540
IT ALSO TAKES THOSE WHO ARE

00:04:34.607 --> 00:04:36.809

IN SACRAMENTO THAT COMMUNITIES

00:15:38.170 --> 00:15:39.672

USING HOUSING AS A TOOL AND

00:16:12.638 --> 00:16:14.807
NOT A REWARD AND CONNECTING

00:16:14.873 --> 00:16:16.408

PARTICIPATING IN SERVICES AND

00:16:20.045 --> 00:16:21.280
THAT WOULD BE ONE OF THE MAJOR

00:16:21.347 --> 00:16:23.749
BEST PRACTICES I THINK WE'VE

00:16:23.816 --> 00:16:25.250

A VARIETY OF COMMUNITIES HAVE

00:21:29.321 --> 00:21:33.158
-- PAST -- LOCAL BOND MEASURES

00:21:33.225 --> 00:21:35.494
TO FUND AFFORDABLE HOUSING

00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:36.962
AND FOR PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE

00:21:37.029 --> 00:21:39.264
HOUSING A LOS ANGELES PASSED

00:21:39.331 --> 00:21:42.100
HHH WHICH IS ONE POINT TWO

00:21:42.167 --> 00:21:43.802
BILLION TO FIND HOPEFULLY

00:21:43.869 --> 00:21:45.203
TEN THOUSAND NEW SUPPORT OF

00:21:45.270 --> 00:21:47.506
HOUSING UNITS ALAMEDA COUNTY

00:21:47.572 --> 00:21:49.341
SANTA CLARA COUNTY EACH PASS

00:21:49.408 --> 00:21:51.443
BOND MEASURES TO FIND HOUSING

00:21:51.510 --> 00:21:53.178
FOR VULNERABLE LOWER INCOME

00:21:53.245 --> 00:21:55.514
PEOPLE -- AGAIN LOW BARRIER

00:21:55.580 --> 00:21:57.082
NAVIGATION CENTERS WERE SEEN

00:21:57.149 --> 00:21:58.717
HERE IN ORANGE COUNTY AS WELL

00:21:58.784 --> 00:22:00.952
SAN FRANCISCO AND LOS ANGELES

00:22:01.019 --> 00:22:03.822
-- THOSE ARE SHELTERS AGAIN

00:22:03.889 --> 00:22:05.323
WITH WHERE YOU'RE REDUCING

00:22:05.390 --> 00:22:07.059
THE BARRIERS AND ENCOURAGING

00:22:07.125 --> 00:22:10.028
PEOPLE TO COME INDOORS SOME

00:22:10.095 --> 00:22:11.763
JURISDICTIONS ARE SUPPLEMENTING

00:22:11.830 --> 00:22:13.932
VASH AND SECTION EIGHT VOUCHERS

00:22:13.999 --> 00:22:15.734
SO THOSE VOUCHERS CAN BE

00:22:15.801 --> 00:22:18.370
USED TO PAY -- RENT THE RENT

00:22:18.437 --> 00:22:19.838
OF LOWER INCOME PEOPLE BUT

00:22:19.905 --> 00:22:21.707
SOMETIMES THEY ARE NOT ENOUGH

00:22:21.773 --> 00:22:24.142
IN THE MARKET SO HAD CAPS THE

00:22:24.209 --> 00:22:25.610
FAIR MARKET RENT OR THE AMOUNT

00:22:25.677 --> 00:22:27.546
THAT VOUCHER CAN BE USED TO

00:22:27.612 --> 00:22:29.715
PAY SO SOME SAN DIEGO FOR

00:22:29.781 --> 00:22:31.717
EXAMPLE IS SUBSIDIZING THOSE

00:22:31.783 --> 00:22:33.952
-- THOSE UNITS IN THIS COULD

00:22:34.019 --> 00:22:35.754
BE A POTENTIAL USE FOR SB TO

00:22:35.821 --> 00:22:37.289
FUNDS WHICH ARE AGAIN A VERY

00:22:37.355 --> 00:22:39.091
FLEXIBLE SOURCE OF FUNDING AND

00:22:39.157 --> 00:22:40.358
LOCALS GET TO DECIDE HOW TO

00:22:40.425 --> 00:22:42.427
SPEND THEM THOSE FUNDS JUST

00:22:42.494 --> 00:22:43.495
A I DON'T THINK I MENTIONED

00:22:43.562 --> 00:22:44.930
EARLIER WILL BECOME AVAILABLE

00:22:44.996 --> 00:22:47.499
THIS YEAR ANOTHER SOLUTION THAT

00:22:47.566 --> 00:22:49.401
SOME JURISDICTIONS ARE PURSUING

00:22:49.468 --> 00:22:51.803
IS A PLACE BASED MODEL LOCATING

00:22:51.870 --> 00:22:53.338
BRIDGE HOUSING IN COMMUNITIES

00:22:53.405 --> 00:22:54.573
WHERE PEOPLE ARE EXPERIENCING

00:22:54.639 --> 00:22:56.174
HOMELESS HOMELESSNESS

00:22:56.241 --> 00:22:57.943
WERE FORMALLY HOMELESS SO

00:22:58.009 --> 00:22:59.478
COMMON MYTH IS THAT PEOPLE

00:22:59.544 --> 00:23:00.912
EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS ARE

00:23:00.979 --> 00:23:03.181
NOT FROM THE COMMUNITY BUT A UC

00:23:03.248 --> 00:23:05.317
DAVIS ARE UC IRVINE STUDY FOUND

00:23:05.383 --> 00:23:07.085
THAT SEVEN OUT OF TEN PEOPLE IN

00:23:07.152 --> 00:23:08.854
ORANGE COUNTY THAT ARE HOMELESS

00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:10.021
HAD LIVED IN THE COUNTY IN

00:23:10.088 --> 00:23:11.823
THE LAST TEN YEARS THIS IS

00:23:11.890 --> 00:23:13.358
ALSO COMMON MYTH ABOUT SAN

00:23:13.425 --> 00:23:14.893
FRANCISCO BUT HAS BEEN FOUND

00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:16.928
TO BE UNTRUE SOME COMMUNITIES

00:23:16.995 --> 00:23:18.630
ARE TRYING TO LOCATE MULTIPLE

00:23:18.697 --> 00:23:20.132
SHELTERS CLOSE TO WHERE PEOPLE

00:23:20.198 --> 00:23:22.467
PREVIOUSLY LIVED -- SOMETIMES

00:23:22.534 --> 00:23:23.702
IT'S BRIDGE HOUSING BRIDGE

00:23:23.769 --> 00:23:25.270
HOUSING TYPICALLY HAS A LIMIT

00:23:25.337 --> 00:23:26.972
ON THE STATE BUT FOCUSES ON

00:23:27.038 --> 00:23:28.373
MOVING PEOPLE INTO PERMANENT

00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:31.476
SUPPORTIVE HOUSING I'M CITIES

00:23:31.543 --> 00:23:32.611
AND COUNTIES ARE STARTING

00:23:32.677 --> 00:23:34.513
TO COLLABORATE REGIONALLY

00:23:34.579 --> 00:23:36.014
OR SEEN THAT HERE THRILLED

00:23:36.081 --> 00:23:37.949
THAT NORTH SPA PARTNERSHIP

00:23:38.016 --> 00:23:39.384
THAT YOU'VE DEVELOPED TO BILL

00:23:39.451 --> 00:23:40.986
TWO FULL SERVICE NAVIGATION

00:23:41.052 --> 00:23:42.854
CENTERS THE FUNDS THAT ARE

00:23:42.921 --> 00:23:44.256
AVAILABLE IN THIS BUDGET

00:23:44.322 --> 00:23:45.824
CYCLE THROUGH HALF REQUIRE

00:23:45.891 --> 00:23:47.325
A REGIONAL PLAN SO THAT'S A

00:23:47.392 --> 00:23:49.628
WAY TO SORT OF ENCOURAGE --

00:23:49.694 --> 00:23:53.498
LOCAL -- COLLABORATION --

00:23:53.565 --> 00:23:55.801
WERE ALSO SEEING A MOTEL AND

00:23:55.867 --> 00:23:57.302
HOTEL CONVERSIONS WHICH ARE

00:23:57.369 --> 00:23:59.171
ALL OPTIONAL FOR SHELTER OR

00:23:59.237 --> 00:24:00.772
SUPPORTIVE HOUSING BECAUSE

00:24:00.839 --> 00:24:02.340
THEY ARE YOUR CONFIGURED AS

00:24:02.407 --> 00:24:04.476
A SINGLE ROOM WITH BATHROOMS

00:24:04.543 --> 00:24:06.244
AND SOMETIMES KITCHENETTES

00:24:06.311 --> 00:24:08.013
MOTELS CAN SOMETIMES BEEN THE

00:24:08.079 --> 00:24:09.781
SITE OF PAST CRIMINAL ACTIVITY

00:24:09.848 --> 00:24:10.882
SO BY CONVERTING THEM TO

00:24:10.949 --> 00:24:12.651
SHELTERS SUPPORTIVE HOUSING

00:24:12.717 --> 00:24:13.652
THEY CAN BE TURNED INTO A

00:24:13.718 --> 00:24:15.787
USEFUL PART OF THE COMMUNITY

00:24:15.854 --> 00:24:18.290
SOME JURISDICTIONS ARE ALIGNING

00:24:18.356 --> 00:24:19.624
AT THEIR HOMELESS AND HOUSING

00:24:19.691 --> 00:24:20.992
DEPARTMENTS SO THAT THEY

00:24:21.059 --> 00:24:22.327
HAVE A SHARED VISION BECAUSE

00:24:22.394 --> 00:24:23.762
AFFORDABLE HOUSING SUPPLY

00:24:23.829 --> 00:24:25.630
IS A SIGNIFICANT IF NOT THE

00:24:25.697 --> 00:24:28.500
SOLUTION TO HOMELESSNESS OTHER

00:24:28.567 --> 00:24:30.035
JURISDICTIONS ARE CREATING

00:24:30.101 --> 00:24:32.437
LOCAL FLEXIBLE HOUSING SUBSIDY

00:24:32.504 --> 00:24:35.774
POLLS -- THESE POOLS ARE AND

00:24:35.841 --> 00:24:37.375
MOST CASES ARE TARGETED AT

00:24:37.442 --> 00:24:39.010
PEOPLE WHO ARE HIGH USERS

00:24:39.077 --> 00:24:40.812
OF THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM SO

00:24:40.879 --> 00:24:42.113
THEY'RE FOCUSED ACHIEVING

00:24:42.180 --> 00:24:44.482
HOUSING STABILITY RESOURCES

00:24:44.549 --> 00:24:45.917
FOR HEALTH AND MENTAL HEALTH

00:24:45.984 --> 00:24:48.887
SERVICES AND CASE MANAGEMENT IN

00:24:48.954 --> 00:24:50.789
LA THEY TARGETED THEIR HIGHEST

00:24:50.856 --> 00:24:51.990
USERS OF THE HEALTH CARE

00:24:52.057 --> 00:24:53.725
SERVICES THEY USED TO BETTER

00:24:53.792 --> 00:24:55.393
CAL DOLLARS PHILANTHROPIC

00:24:55.460 --> 00:24:57.662
FUNDS AND LOCAL FUNDS SOME

00:24:57.729 --> 00:24:59.865
JURISDICTIONS ARE USING THESE

00:24:59.931 --> 00:25:01.633
FUNDS TO KEEP PEOPLE HOUSE TO

00:25:01.700 --> 00:25:03.902
FILL IN THE GAPS SO IF YOU'RE

00:25:03.969 --> 00:25:04.870
MISSING YOUR FIRST MONTH'S

00:25:04.936 --> 00:25:06.471
RENT IF YOU NEED A SECURITY

00:25:06.538 --> 00:25:08.540
DEPOSIT FOCUSED AT PREVENTING

00:25:08.607 --> 00:25:11.176
PEOPLE FROM BECOMING HOMELESS

00:25:11.243 --> 00:25:12.677
OTHERS ARE USING IT AS A

00:25:12.744 --> 00:25:14.713
LANDLORD INCENTIVE TO RENT

00:25:14.779 --> 00:25:16.348
TO THE LOCAL POPULATIONS BY

00:25:16.414 --> 00:25:18.183
SETTING FUNDS ASIDE THAT CAN

00:25:18.250 --> 00:25:19.684
BE DRAWN DOWN FOR SECURITY

00:25:19.751 --> 00:25:22.220
DEPOSITS FURNISHINGS ANTENNA

00:25:22.287 --> 00:25:25.824
DAMAGES SO I PUT TOGETHER JUST

00:25:25.891 --> 00:25:27.359
SOME POSSIBLE NEXT STEPS THIS

00:25:27.425 --> 00:25:28.760
IS CERTAINLY NOT AN EXHAUSTIVE

00:25:28.827 --> 00:25:30.161
LIST BUT AT THE STATE SORT

00:25:30.228 --> 00:25:31.529
OF THINKING ABOUT WHAT WE

00:25:31.596 --> 00:25:33.565
CAN DO BETTER TO SUPPORT --

00:25:33.632 --> 00:25:36.201
LOCAL EFFORTS -- FIRST IS THAT

00:25:36.268 --> 00:25:38.670
CALIFORNIA FUNDS OVER TAVERN

00:25:38.737 --> 00:25:40.472
EIGHTEEN DIFFERENT PROGRAMS

00:25:40.538 --> 00:25:42.440
SPECIFICALLY TARGETED AT

00:25:42.507 --> 00:25:43.942
ENDING HOMELESSNESS AT SIX

00:25:44.009 --> 00:25:45.543
DIFFERENT STATE DEPARTMENTS

00:25:45.610 --> 00:25:46.678
AND EACH DEPARTMENT HAS A

00:25:46.745 --> 00:25:48.013
DIFFERENT MISSION CULTURE AND

00:25:48.079 --> 00:25:49.447
KNOWLEDGE OF HOUSING RELATED

00:25:49.514 --> 00:25:51.182
OR HOUSING ISSUES THE CHAIR

00:25:51.249 --> 00:25:52.884
CARRIED A BILL LAST YEAR AB

00:25:52.951 --> 00:25:54.252
SIXTEEN TO TRYING TO LINE

00:25:54.319 --> 00:25:56.354
THOSE -- DIFFERENT PROGRAMS

00:25:56.421 --> 00:25:57.455
AND THAT WOULD BE A WAY TO

00:25:57.522 --> 00:25:59.557
CREATE COST EFFICIENCIES AND

00:25:59.624 --> 00:26:02.093
TO REALLY NOT REALLY DETERMINE

00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:04.229
KIND OF WHAT OUR -- INVESTMENT

00:26:04.296 --> 00:26:06.631
IS AND HOW TO STREAMLINE IT

00:26:06.698 --> 00:26:07.966
CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN USING

00:26:08.033 --> 00:26:09.801
MEDICAL FUNDS TO THE FEDERAL

00:26:09.868 --> 00:26:11.603
HOLE PERSON PILOT TO PAY FOR

00:26:11.670 --> 00:26:13.705
SERVICES IN CASE MANAGEMENT

00:26:13.772 --> 00:26:15.040
AND WRAP AROUND SERVICES FOR

00:26:15.106 --> 00:26:16.875
PEOPLE WHO ARE HOMELESS AND

00:26:16.942 --> 00:26:18.376
THE WHOLE PERSON CARE PILOT

00:26:18.443 --> 00:26:20.812
IS COMING TO AN END BUT DH

00:26:20.879 --> 00:26:23.014
CS HAS PUT OUT A NEW CONCEPT

00:26:23.081 --> 00:26:24.382
TO CREATE A BENEFIT AROUND

00:26:24.449 --> 00:26:26.618
SERVICES CASE MANAGEMENT TO

00:26:26.685 --> 00:26:29.220
POTENTIALLY TAKE THAT -- PLACE

00:26:29.287 --> 00:26:30.855
OF THE WHOLE PERSON CARE PILOT

00:26:30.922 --> 00:26:32.557
AND AGAIN THIS IS A WAY TO TRY

00:26:32.624 --> 00:26:35.226
AND PROVIDE CASE MANAGEMENT

00:26:35.293 --> 00:26:37.295
AND SERVICES TO HOUSE OUR MOST

00:26:37.362 --> 00:26:39.197
VULNERABLE CHRONICALLY HOMELESS

00:26:39.264 --> 00:26:43.201
MEDI CAL RECIPIENTS AM WE

00:26:43.268 --> 00:26:44.970
ALSO COULD CREATE A STATEWIDE

00:26:45.036 --> 00:26:46.504
DATA WAREHOUSE TO COORDINATE

00:26:46.571 --> 00:26:47.872
RESOURCES AT THE STATE LEVEL

00:26:47.939 --> 00:26:51.076
TO ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS --

00:26:51.142 --> 00:26:52.777
LOCAL JURISDICTIONS ARE ALSO

00:26:52.844 --> 00:26:54.412
LOOKING AT BEST PRACTICES TO

00:26:54.479 --> 00:26:56.982
PREVENT HOMELESSNESS -- WHICH

00:26:57.048 --> 00:26:58.583
IS A GREAT IDEA WE NEED TO

00:26:58.650 --> 00:27:00.652
THINK ABOUT SORT OF WHAT HOW

00:27:00.719 --> 00:27:04.055
TO -- FOCUS THOSE ON THOSE

00:27:04.122 --> 00:27:05.423
THAT ARE TRULY AT RISK OF

00:27:05.490 --> 00:27:07.325
HOMELESSNESS PEOPLE WHO ARE

00:27:07.392 --> 00:27:09.327
HOMELESS FOR A FEW MONTHS TEND

00:27:09.394 --> 00:27:10.762
TO HAVE A HARDER TIME GETTING

00:27:10.829 --> 00:27:12.063
BACK INTO HOUSING BECAUSE

00:27:12.130 --> 00:27:13.865
THEY LOSE THEIR JOB THEY HAVE

00:27:13.932 --> 00:27:16.501
HEALTH IMPACTS AND SO WE NEED

00:27:16.568 --> 00:27:18.503
TO THINK THIS IS A A GOOD WE

00:27:18.570 --> 00:27:20.338
ARE SEEING AND MORE PEOPLE FALL

00:27:20.405 --> 00:27:22.040
INTO HOMELESSNESS AS WE TRIED

00:27:22.107 --> 00:27:24.109
TO HOUSE PEOPLE SO WE NEED TO

00:27:24.175 --> 00:27:25.810
PUSH THESE IDEAS FOR BUT THINK

00:27:25.877 --> 00:27:27.846
ABOUT HOW TO DO IT BEST AND

00:27:27.912 --> 00:27:29.581
THEN FINALLY THEY -- HOMELESS

00:27:29.647 --> 00:27:31.816
POPULATION IS POPULATION IS

00:27:31.883 --> 00:27:34.285
AGING AS OUR OVERALL POPULATION

00:27:34.352 --> 00:27:36.888
IS AGING RESEARCH BY MARGARET

00:27:36.955 --> 00:27:38.690
WHO SHALL WITH YOU SEE AS AFTER

00:27:38.757 --> 00:27:40.625
SHOWS THAT A GROWING STATEMENT

00:27:40.692 --> 00:27:41.793
OF HOMELESS OF THE HOMELESS

00:27:41.860 --> 00:27:44.496
POPULATION OUR SENIORS SHE

00:27:44.562 --> 00:27:46.064
FOUND THAT AMERICANS BORN IN

00:27:46.131 --> 00:27:47.399
THE SECOND HALF OF THE BABY

00:27:47.465 --> 00:27:49.100
BOOM NINETEEN FIFTY FIVE TO

00:27:49.167 --> 00:27:51.002
NINETEEN SIXTY FIVE HAVE AN

00:27:51.069 --> 00:27:52.937
ELEVATED RISK OF HOMELESSNESS

00:27:53.004 --> 00:27:54.606
THROUGHOUT THEIR LIFETIME AND

00:27:54.672 --> 00:27:56.141
SHE FOUND THAT SOME SENIORS HAD

00:27:56.207 --> 00:27:57.675
NEVER EXPERIENCED HOMELESSNESS

00:27:57.742 --> 00:27:58.977
WILL PICK BUT WE'RE BECOMING

00:27:59.044 --> 00:28:00.879
HOMELESS BECAUSE OF A SUDDEN

00:28:00.945 --> 00:28:03.048
HEALTH CRISIS ARE JOB LOSS OR

00:28:03.114 --> 00:28:04.916
A SPOUSE DYING AND MANY ARE

00:28:04.983 --> 00:28:07.585
IN POOR HEALTH SO SENIORS ARE

00:28:07.652 --> 00:28:10.655
REALLY ACUTELY -- IMPACTED BY

00:28:10.722 --> 00:28:12.524
THE HOUSING CRISIS AMONG THE

00:28:12.590 --> 00:28:14.392
RENTER'S AGE FIFTY YEAR OVER

00:28:14.459 --> 00:28:15.927
THIRTY PERCENT SPEND MORE THAN

00:28:15.994 --> 00:28:17.829
HALF OF THEIR INCOME AND RENT

00:28:17.896 --> 00:28:19.731
AND ARE CONSIDERED -- SEVERELY

00:28:19.798 --> 00:28:21.433
HOUSING BURDENED SO WE NEED

00:28:21.499 --> 00:28:22.634

FOR ALMOST ANYONE TO NAVIGATE

00:31:31.856 --> 00:31:32.857
AND I THINK WE FIND OURSELVES

00:31:32.924 --> 00:31:34.726
IN A SITUATION WHERE UNLESS

00:31:34.792 --> 00:31:36.661

WELL I THINK I AM STREAMLINING

00:31:57.382 --> 00:31:58.650
SOME OF THE DEPARTMENTS AND

00:31:58.716 --> 00:32:00.418
AGAIN PART OF IT IS JUST HAVING

00:32:00.485 --> 00:32:03.554
A A COMMON APPLICATION PROCESS

00:32:03.621 --> 00:32:05.723
GUIDELINES WOULD BE HELPFUL

00:32:05.790 --> 00:32:08.526
-- ALSO IF IT'S USEFUL EACH CD

00:32:08.593 --> 00:32:09.560
THE DEPARTMENT HOUSING HUMAN

00:32:09.627 --> 00:32:10.795

JURISDICTIONS APPLY FOR FUNDS

00:32:16.167 --> 00:32:17.135
I CAN LOOK AT THAT AND SEE

00:32:17.201 --> 00:32:18.303
IF THAT STILL IN EXISTENCE

00:32:18.369 --> 00:32:19.904
BUT I MEAN IT WILL TAKE A

00:32:19.971 --> 00:32:22.473
LOT OF WILL TO RE ORGANIZE

00:32:22.540 --> 00:32:23.908
-- OUR DEPARTMENTS BUT I DO

00:32:23.975 --> 00:32:26.878
THINK WE KIND OF LACK A GLOBAL

00:32:26.944 --> 00:32:28.212
PLAN AROUND HOMELESSNESS

00:32:28.279 --> 00:32:29.280
AT THE STATE LEVEL AND THAT

00:32:29.347 --> 00:32:30.148
WOULD BE AN OPPORTUNITY TO

00:32:30.214 --> 00:32:31.983
DO THAT A STATEWIDE DATABASE

00:32:32.050 --> 00:32:33.184
WOULD ALSO DO THAT IT GIVE

00:32:33.251 --> 00:32:34.519
US A CHANCE TO SEE REALLY

00:32:34.585 --> 00:32:36.087
WHERE INVESTMENTS ARE GOING

00:32:36.154 --> 00:32:37.488
WHERE LOCALS ARE VESTING AND

00:32:37.555 --> 00:32:40.525
HOW WE CAN SUPPORT LOCALS

00:32:40.591 --> 00:32:42.794
I'M IN PICKING UP ON THAT SO

00:32:42.860 --> 00:32:45.163
RIGHT NOW WHAT ARE WE DOING TO

00:32:45.229 --> 00:32:47.031

00:32:47.098 --> 00:32:49.667
STATE DOLLARS IN HOW DO WE KNOW

00:32:49.734 --> 00:32:50.702
THAT THE MONEY WE'RE INVESTING

00:32:50.768 --> 00:32:53.137

00:32:56.441 --> 00:32:57.875
THAT WOULD GO OUT QUICKLY AND

00:32:57.942 --> 00:32:59.310
HELP AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

00:32:59.377 --> 00:33:01.412

THAT AND PUT IT INTO IS --

00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:45.817
PACKAGE AS FAR AS BUDGET BUT WE

00:34:45.883 --> 00:34:47.885
WILL RUN AGAIN STREAMLINING THE

00:34:47.952 --> 00:34:49.554
APPLICATION BECAUSE FOR SOME

00:34:49.620 --> 00:34:52.623
OF YOU WHO HAVE -- YOUNG ADULTS

00:34:52.690 --> 00:34:53.958
AND HELP THEM TO THE COLLEGE

00:34:54.025 --> 00:34:55.660
PROCESS WE KNOW THAT THERE'S A

00:34:55.726 --> 00:34:59.030
FORMULA YOU APPLY TO MANY BUT

00:34:59.096 --> 00:35:00.765
THE SAME PARAMETERS ARE FOR

00:35:00.832 --> 00:35:02.733
MOST OF THE APPLICATIONS BUT

00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:04.235
FOR A LOT OF THE INDIVIDUAL

00:35:04.302 --> 00:35:06.404
CITIES THEY MIGHT APPLY FOR ONE

00:35:06.471 --> 00:35:08.239
AND NOT KNOW WHAT ABOUT ANOTHER

00:35:08.306 --> 00:35:09.507
AND IF WE COULD STREAMLINE

00:35:09.574 --> 00:35:11.242
THAT SO MAYBE EVEN DEADLINES

00:35:11.309 --> 00:35:13.845
AND SO FORTH BECOME MUCH MORE

00:35:13.911 --> 00:35:15.246
LIKE THIS IS A TIME OR CITY

00:35:15.313 --> 00:35:16.881
HAS TO GET THESE APPLICATIONS

00:35:16.948 --> 00:35:19.083
IN IT I THINK IT STARTS TO

00:35:19.150 --> 00:35:21.586
SHIFT ON HOW CITIES LOCAL

00:35:21.652 --> 00:35:23.521

00:35:23.588 --> 00:35:25.189
MISS THAT DEADLINE BUT IF YOU

00:35:27.291 --> 00:35:29.961
HOUSING -- TIME JUST LIKE WITH

00:35:30.027 --> 00:35:32.129
COLLEGE ADMISSIONS I THINK WE

00:35:32.196 --> 00:35:33.865
COULD START TO SEEK RECEIVE AN

00:35:33.931 --> 00:35:35.533
ORANGE COUNTY AND EAT AND OTHER

00:35:35.600 --> 00:35:37.268
COUNTIES THOSE DOLLARS THAT

00:35:37.335 --> 00:35:39.604
THE STATE HAS THAT WE HAVEN'T

00:35:39.670 --> 00:35:42.273
ALWAYS BEEN ABLE TO ATTAIN SO

00:35:42.340 --> 00:35:44.041
RIGHT ABSOLUTELY AND I THINK

00:35:44.108 --> 00:35:44.976
I THINK THE OTHER THING THAT

00:35:45.042 --> 00:35:46.577
IT DOES IS TO YOUR POINT IT'S

AND THEY'RE NOT USING EVIDENCE

00:42:23.507 --> 00:42:25.609
BASED BEST PRACTICES SO THAT

00:42:25.676 --> 00:42:27.044
SO EVIDENCE OF MEDICATION

00:42:27.111 --> 00:42:28.646
ASSISTED TREATMENT USES A

00:42:28.712 --> 00:42:30.981

00:43:13.123 --> 00:43:14.825
THIS CONDITION OF THE WAY OUT

00:43:14.892 --> 00:43:16.160
OF THIS CONDITION OF HAVING

00:43:16.226 --> 00:43:18.362
THIS CRAVING FOR OPIATES AT

00:43:18.429 --> 00:43:21.665
THE SAME TIME -- AT THE SAME

00:43:21.732 --> 00:43:24.168
TIME -- PREVENT THEM FROM BEING

00:43:24.234 --> 00:43:26.804
ABLE TO RELAPSE -- THE PROBLEM

00:43:26.870 --> 00:43:29.273
WITH THAT IS THAT YOU HAVE TO

00:43:29.340 --> 00:43:31.175
TAKE THIS PEOPLE ARE FAN DALY

00:43:31.241 --> 00:43:33.043
AND OFTENTIMES WHEN PEOPLE

00:43:33.110 --> 00:43:34.945
WITH THE WORST PEOPLE WITH THIS

00:43:35.012 --> 00:43:37.181
-- WORSENING ADDICTIONS ENTER

00:43:37.247 --> 00:43:38.816
OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM

MEDICATIONS THE TREATMENTS

00:43:43.153 --> 00:43:45.155
IN OUR JAILS AND SO THAT'S

00:43:45.222 --> 00:43:46.156
SOMETHING THAT WE CAN FIX

00:43:46.223 --> 00:43:47.057
LOCALLY AND THAT'S SOMETHING

00:43:47.124 --> 00:43:48.492
THAT WE CAN FIX STATEWIDE

00:43:48.559 --> 00:43:49.593
AND I DO THINK THAT THIS IS

00:43:49.660 --> 00:43:51.161
GOING TO HAVE AN IMPACT ON OUR

00:43:51.228 --> 00:43:52.763
HOMELESSNESS CRISIS BECAUSE

00:43:52.830 --> 00:43:54.231
IF WE DON'T START TAKING THIS

00:43:54.298 --> 00:43:56.266
THIS AT THIS PROBLEM OF OPIATE

00:43:56.333 --> 00:43:57.835
ADDICTION IS OPIATE EPIDEMIC

00:43:57.901 --> 00:43:59.036
WHICH IS CLAIMING THE LIVES

00:43:59.103 --> 00:44:00.571
OF PEOPLE I'M FOR NOT ONLY

00:44:00.637 --> 00:44:01.572

PREVENTABLE LEVELS AND WE'RE

00:44:05.642 --> 00:44:07.244
NOT GOING TO SEE AN END TO

00:44:07.311 --> 00:44:09.246
WITH THE STIGMA ASSOCIATED

00:44:09.313 --> 00:44:11.281
WITH DRUG ADDICTION AT THE AND

00:44:11.348 --> 00:44:12.349
IN ALL THE PROBLEMS OF COURSE

00:44:12.416 --> 00:44:13.550
SOME MIGHT -- BUT THAT THE

IN THE COMMUNITY -- WE'RE NOT

00:44:20.924 --> 00:44:21.925
GOING TO SEE AN END TO THAT

00:44:21.992 --> 00:44:23.994
UNLESS WE HAVE ESSENTIALLY

00:44:24.061 --> 00:44:26.030
LOCALLY -- THIS THIS ISSUE

00:44:26.096 --> 00:44:28.399
FIXED BY ALLOWING PEOPLE WHEN

00:44:28.465 --> 00:44:31.035
THEY GO TO JAIL UPON BOOKING

00:44:31.101 --> 00:44:32.469
TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TAKING

00:44:32.536 --> 00:44:34.204
THEIR DRUGS -- INCLUDING PEOPLE

-- IF WE DON'T SEE THAT CHANGE

00:44:44.782 --> 00:44:45.616
THEN ESSENTIALLY WHAT WE'RE

00:44:45.682 --> 00:44:47.651
EXPECTING PEOPLE TO DO AND I'VE

00:44:47.718 --> 00:44:50.387

THEY GET ON METHADONE TO GET ON

00:45:07.504 --> 00:45:09.106
SUBOXONE THEN WHAT HAPPENS THEY

GET PICKED UP BY THE POLICE

00:45:10.607 --> 00:45:12.209

WITH BEING HOMELESS HAPPENS

00:45:16.713 --> 00:45:18.048
ALL TOO OFTEN THEY GO TO

00:45:18.115 --> 00:45:19.583
JAIL THEY'RE DOING EVERYTHING

00:45:19.650 --> 00:45:20.651
THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE DOING

00:45:20.717 --> 00:45:21.685
THERE AREN'T THEY'RE TAKING

00:45:21.752 --> 00:45:23.220
THEIR TREATMENTS RIGHT BUT WHEN

00:45:23.287 --> 00:45:24.655
THEY GO TO THE JAILS THEY'RE

00:45:24.721 --> 00:45:26.056
TOLD WE'RE NOT GOING TO GIVE

00:45:26.123 --> 00:45:27.524

GIVE YOU YOUR SUBOXONE WE

00:45:29.026 --> 00:45:30.994
DON'T DO THAT SO THE SAUDI

00:45:31.061 --> 00:45:32.096
DO INSTEAD IS THEY GIVE YOU A

00:45:32.162 --> 00:45:34.031
DRUG TO DRINK TO ESSENTIALLY

00:45:34.098 --> 00:45:35.632
TRANSITION YOU OFF OF THAT TO

00:45:35.699 --> 00:45:37.434
GET YOU OFF OF METHADONE STATE

00:45:37.501 --> 00:45:38.969
GIVE YOU VARIOUS DRUGS LIKE

YOU KNOW ASPIRIN OR DRUGS FOR

00:45:40.604 --> 00:45:42.072
A CERTAIN DRUGS FOR YEAR YOU

00:45:42.139 --> 00:45:43.540
FOR THE VARIOUS SIDE EFFECTS

00:45:43.607 --> 00:45:45.676
OF OF OPIATE WITHDRAWALS LIKE

00:45:45.742 --> 00:45:48.212
-- VOMITING OR DIARRHEA EXTREME

00:45:48.278 --> 00:45:51.381
PAIN EXTREME DISCOMFORT ARM AND

00:45:51.448 --> 00:45:52.683
SO YOU'RE SO THEY'RE TREATING

00:45:52.749 --> 00:45:54.451
THE SYMPTOMS ASSOCIATED WITH

00:45:54.518 --> 00:45:55.919
OPIATE WITHDRAWALS IN THE

00:45:55.986 --> 00:45:58.355
JAILS BUT THAT'S POINTLESS

00:45:58.422 --> 00:45:59.790
BECAUSE WHEN THEY GET RELEASE

00:45:59.857 --> 00:46:01.391
FROM THE JAILS EITHER GOING

00:46:01.458 --> 00:46:03.327
TO RELAPSE BACK ONTO OPIATES

00:46:03.393 --> 00:46:04.695
OR THEY'RE GONNA GO RIGHT BACK

00:46:04.761 --> 00:46:06.296
TO WHAT THEY SHOULD BE DOING

00:46:06.363 --> 00:46:08.031
WHICH IS GETTING ON MEDICATION

00:46:08.098 --> 00:46:09.833
ASSISTED TREATMENT SO THIS IS

00:46:09.900 --> 00:46:11.235
AN ISSUE THAT NEEDS TO STOP

00:46:11.301 --> 00:46:12.603
AND CURRENTLY IN ORDER AND IN

00:46:12.669 --> 00:46:15.772
JAILS IN ORANGE COUNTY -- WE

00:46:15.839 --> 00:46:18.342
WE RECOGNIZE THAT PEOPLE WHO

00:46:18.408 --> 00:46:20.844
ARE PREGNANT AND ON METHADONE

00:46:20.911 --> 00:46:22.146
SHOULD BE CONTINUED ON THE

00:46:22.212 --> 00:46:23.981
METHADONE TREATMENT BECAUSE WE

00:46:24.047 --> 00:46:25.749
DON'T WANT TO PUT THEIR FETUSES

00:46:25.816 --> 00:46:27.718
INTO WITHDRAWAL AND ESSENTIALLY

00:46:27.784 --> 00:46:29.887
BECAUSE OF THE -- TO -- TO

00:46:29.953 --> 00:46:32.723
MISCARRY SO WOMEN FOR PREGNANT

00:46:32.789 --> 00:46:34.658
ARE ACTUALLY IMMEDIATELY UPON

00:46:34.725 --> 00:46:36.326
BOOKING ALLOWED TO CONTINUE

00:46:36.393 --> 00:46:39.029
TAKING METHADONE HOWEVER THAT'S

00:46:39.096 --> 00:46:40.764
NOT THE CASE WITH EVERY OTHER

00:46:40.831 --> 00:46:42.699
IN THE UPON BOOKING SO THAT

00:46:42.766 --> 00:46:44.201
NEEDS TO CHANGE LOCALLY AND

00:46:44.268 --> 00:46:45.202
I THINK THAT NEEDS TO CHANGE

00:46:45.269 --> 00:46:47.204
STATEWIDE AND SO I DID HAVE

00:46:47.271 --> 00:46:48.972
SO I BASICALLY DID HAVE A

00:46:49.039 --> 00:46:50.174

ON -- THAN MATH SO IF YOU HAVE

00:48:26.637 --> 00:48:27.704
LIKE A MATH PROBLEM IF YOU'RE

00:48:27.771 --> 00:48:29.706
SPENDING TEN BUCKS A DAY TRYING

00:48:29.773 --> 00:48:31.508
TO FUEL YOUR METHOD ACTION WITH

00:48:31.575 --> 00:48:33.277
OPIATES IT'S CLOSER TO YOU BY

00:48:33.343 --> 00:48:34.478
THE TIME YOU'RE SHOOTING UP

00:48:34.544 --> 00:48:35.712
MAYBE SEVENTY EIGHTY DOLLARS A

00:48:35.779 --> 00:48:37.414
DAY I'M SO THE ONLY WAY YOU'RE

00:48:37.481 --> 00:48:38.715
ABLE TO KIND OF SUSTAIN THAT

00:48:38.782 --> 00:48:42.052
HABIT IS BY STEALING ARM BY

00:48:42.119 --> 00:48:46.823
SELLING -- SO SO ALL SO I MEAN

00:48:46.890 --> 00:48:48.292
I WOULD SAY THAT THEIR THEIR

00:48:48.358 --> 00:48:49.259
PRODUCT I MEAN THERE THERE'S

00:48:49.326 --> 00:48:50.794
OBVIOUSLY TREATMENTS FOR MATH

00:48:50.861 --> 00:48:52.963
ADDICTION AS WELL -- IT'S A LOT

00:48:53.030 --> 00:48:54.564
HARDER TO OVERDOSE ON MATH AND

00:48:54.631 --> 00:48:56.166
IT IS TO OVERDOSE ON OPIATES

00:48:56.233 --> 00:48:58.902
OPIATES -- OPIATES ARE OFTEN

00:48:58.969 --> 00:49:02.239
LACED WITH -- -- WITH FAT NOW

00:49:02.306 --> 00:49:04.074
WHICH IS A SYNTHETIC OPIATE ARM

00:49:04.141 --> 00:49:06.009
WHICH IN VERY VERY VERY MINUTE

00:49:06.076 --> 00:49:07.878
JOE SAYS I'M COULD EASILY KILL

00:49:07.944 --> 00:49:09.246
YOU I'M UNFORTUNATELY WE'RE

00:49:09.313 --> 00:49:10.614
SEEING FAT NOW BEING LOCATED IN

00:49:10.681 --> 00:49:13.450
OTHER DRUGS AS WELL -- AND SO

00:49:13.517 --> 00:49:18.355
IN TERMS OF THE IN TERMS OF THE

00:49:18.422 --> 00:49:19.990
IN THAT THE OF THE FATALITIES

00:49:20.057 --> 00:49:21.692
CAUSED BY DIFFERENT DRUGS I

00:49:21.758 --> 00:49:23.160
THINK THAT MORE PEOPLE DIE IT

00:49:23.226 --> 00:49:24.761
WILL BE IT'S PROBABLY MOST I

00:49:24.828 --> 00:49:26.063
MEAN PROBABLY A GREATER NUMBER

00:49:26.129 --> 00:49:27.764
DIVE -- ALCOHOL ADDICTION AS

00:49:27.831 --> 00:49:29.766
WELL SO SO SO THERE NEEDS TO

00:49:29.833 --> 00:49:31.201
THEIR NEEDS TO BE YOU KNOW MORE

00:49:31.268 --> 00:49:32.869
TREATMENT OBVIOUSLY FOR ALL

00:49:32.936 --> 00:49:34.471
THESE SUBSTANCE ABUSE ISSUES

00:49:34.538 --> 00:49:35.972
BY THE REASON WHY I FOCUS ON

00:49:36.039 --> 00:49:39.443
OPIATES IS BECAUSE ONE ARM THE

00:49:39.509 --> 00:49:42.079
THE THE THE THE FATALITY RATES

00:49:42.145 --> 00:49:45.215
CAUSED BY OPIATES ARM TO ARM

00:49:45.282 --> 00:49:48.218
THE OF THE BUT THAT THE WAY

00:49:48.285 --> 00:49:50.220
THAT IT COMPLETELY DESTROYS

00:49:50.287 --> 00:49:52.422
PEOPLE'S LIVES AND RUIN SOME

00:49:52.489 --> 00:49:53.623
FINANCIALLY AND RUINS OF

00:49:53.690 --> 00:49:55.492
ECONOMICALLY IS VERY SPECIFIC

00:49:55.559 --> 00:49:57.394
AND VERY UNIQUE TO OPIATES --

00:49:57.461 --> 00:49:59.730
AND THREE WHEN PEOPLE OFTEN

00:49:59.796 --> 00:50:03.433
USE OPIATES ARM SINCE OPIATES

00:50:03.500 --> 00:50:05.068
ESSENTIALLY HAVE THIS NARCOTIC

00:50:05.135 --> 00:50:06.203
THEY HAVE AN ARCATA CA FACT

00:50:06.269 --> 00:50:07.938
OBVIOUSLY BUT THEY'RE THEY'RE

00:50:08.004 --> 00:50:09.439
THEY'RE KIND OF LIKE AT A

00:50:09.506 --> 00:50:11.475
DOWNER DRUG OFTEN PEOPLE WILL

00:50:11.541 --> 00:50:13.543
USE OPIATES IN CONJUNCTION WITH

00:50:13.610 --> 00:50:15.078
MATH WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY KIND

00:50:15.145 --> 00:50:17.280
OF AN UPPER DRUG SO OFTEN TIMES

00:50:17.347 --> 00:50:19.816
YOU SEE THIS ARM HE IS YOU SEE

00:50:19.883 --> 00:50:21.852
THIS -- DO WILL OCCURRING LIKE

00:50:21.918 --> 00:50:24.354
ADDICTION ARE WHERE PEOPLE ARE

00:50:24.421 --> 00:50:25.822
ARE TAKING BOTH TRUCKS VERY

00:50:25.889 --> 00:50:27.124
VERY REGULARLY IT'S CALLED

00:50:27.190 --> 00:50:29.459
SPEED BALLING ESSENTIALLY ARM

00:50:29.526 --> 00:50:32.662
AND -- AND AND SO I I THINK

00:50:32.729 --> 00:50:34.931
THAT -- OPIATES ARE OFTEN A

00:50:34.998 --> 00:50:37.834
GATEWAY INTO I'M ESSENTIALLY

00:50:37.901 --> 00:50:42.239
WORSE AND WORSE ARM USE ARM

00:50:42.305 --> 00:50:44.474
WHEN PEOPLE GO FROM SMOKING TO

00:50:44.541 --> 00:50:46.943
SHOOTING UP OPIATES THERE THE

00:50:47.010 --> 00:50:48.111
ADDICTIONS GET EXPONENTIALLY

00:50:48.178 --> 00:50:50.680
WORSE IN TERMS OF -- EIGHT HOW

00:50:50.747 --> 00:50:51.882
MUCH SHE HOW MUCH IS ACTUALLY

00:50:51.948 --> 00:50:53.350
IT IS THAT YOU'RE SPENDING IN

00:50:53.417 --> 00:50:55.051
ORDER SHOULD UP VERSES WHEN

00:50:55.118 --> 00:50:57.087
YOUR HABIT IS BASICALLY JUST

00:50:57.154 --> 00:50:59.055
SMOKING BY BLACK TAR HEROIN

00:50:59.122 --> 00:51:01.024
ARM AND BE LIKE THE THE THE

00:51:01.091 --> 00:51:02.926
LEVELS OF LIKE COMPLICATIONS

00:51:02.993 --> 00:51:04.761
ARM FROM SHOOTING APPARENTLY

00:51:04.828 --> 00:51:06.329
I'VE FROM SHOOTING UP HEROIN

00:51:06.396 --> 00:51:07.764
SO ESSENTIALLY LIKE OPIATES

00:51:07.831 --> 00:51:09.366
NEED TO BE ADDRESSED AND IT'S

00:51:09.433 --> 00:51:10.534
BUT WITH ONE OF THE HARDEST

00:51:10.600 --> 00:51:11.701
IT'S ONE THE HARDEST TO BE ABLE

00:51:11.768 --> 00:51:13.937
TO -- TO BE ABLE TO OVERCOME

00:51:14.004 --> 00:51:15.372
ANOTHER ANOTHER FACT TO KNOW

00:51:15.439 --> 00:51:16.940
ABOUT THIS IS THAT YOU CAN'T

00:51:17.007 --> 00:51:18.041
NECESSARILY I MEAN YOU DON'T

00:51:18.108 --> 00:51:20.277
REALLY DIE FROM MASS WITHDRAWAL

00:51:20.343 --> 00:51:21.845
YOU ABSOLUTELY CAN WITHDRAW

00:51:21.912 --> 00:51:23.246
CAN DIE FROM HEROIN WITHDRAWAL

00:51:23.313 --> 00:51:24.147
BECAUSE OF ALL THE DIFFERENT

00:51:24.214 --> 00:51:25.615
COMPLICATIONS IN TERMS OF LIKE

00:51:25.682 --> 00:51:28.385
THE VOMITING ARMS THE DIARRHEA

00:51:28.452 --> 00:51:30.320
-- AND LIKE ALL AND JUST STATE

00:51:30.387 --> 00:51:31.988
THE HYDRATION AT THAT CAN COME

00:51:32.055 --> 00:51:33.490
FROM THAT YOU ABSOLUTELY CAN'T

00:51:33.557 --> 00:51:35.225
DIE FROM THE AT THE WITHDRAWALS

00:51:35.292 --> 00:51:37.060
ARE ALSO ALL VERY EXTREMELY

00:51:37.127 --> 00:51:38.962
SEVERE WHEN IT COMES TO IT I'M

00:51:39.029 --> 00:51:41.064
VERSUS OTHER DRUGS BUT HEROIN

00:51:41.131 --> 00:51:42.966
IS NOT AN OPIATE OR NOT ANOTHER

00:51:43.033 --> 00:51:44.835
ONE IS AN OPIATE YES KAREN IS

00:51:44.901 --> 00:51:47.737
AN OPIATE -- AND THEN YOU ALSO

00:51:47.804 --> 00:51:50.307
HAVE YOU KNOW PHARMACEUTICALS

00:51:50.373 --> 00:51:53.210
-- LAKE PHICHIT N.

00:51:53.276 --> 00:51:54.611
METHADONE ALL OF THESE

00:51:54.678 --> 00:51:56.179
ARE OPIATES THEY THEY THEY

00:51:56.246 --> 00:51:58.114
WORK IN THAT SAME WAY --

00:51:58.181 --> 00:51:59.182
BUT YEAH SO WE NEED IF

00:51:59.249 --> 00:52:00.817
WE NEED TO GET A LOOK AT

00:52:00.884 --> 00:52:02.085
MEDICATIONS AS A TREATMENT FOR

00:52:02.152 --> 00:52:05.489
TREATING -- OPIATE ADDICTION

00:52:05.555 --> 00:52:06.690
SO REMEMBER THAT LAST

00:52:06.756 --> 00:52:07.591
QUESTION VERY TIED TO THE

00:52:07.657 --> 00:52:09.326
SO SO YOU DON'T YOU'RE NOT

00:52:09.392 --> 00:52:12.829
RECOMMEND THAT WE DO YOU

00:52:12.896 --> 00:52:14.231
MEDIC MEDICATION IS THE

00:52:14.297 --> 00:52:15.799
TREATMENT THAT WE DON'T

00:52:15.866 --> 00:52:16.867
YOU TALKED ABOUT STEVE I

00:52:16.933 --> 00:52:18.602
LEGISLATION THAT YOU ARE

00:52:18.668 --> 00:52:20.670
PROPOSING YEAH AND YOUR FOCUS

00:52:20.737 --> 00:52:22.239
SPECIFICALLY ABOUT OPIATES

00:52:22.305 --> 00:52:24.875
AND NOT JUST MEDICATED

00:52:24.941 --> 00:52:26.543
ASSISTED TREATMENT IN GENERAL

00:52:26.610 --> 00:52:27.611
WHAT MADE IT MEDICATIONS

00:52:27.677 --> 00:52:29.045
THAT THE TREATMENT IS KIND

00:52:29.112 --> 00:52:30.480
OF A TERM OF ART T.

00:52:30.547 --> 00:52:32.148
ARM THAT'S THAT IS TO DESCRIBE

00:52:32.215 --> 00:52:33.683
THIS VERY SPECIFIC MEDICAL

00:52:33.750 --> 00:52:35.886
INTERVENTION -- FOR OPIATES

00:52:35.952 --> 00:52:37.053
I THINK THE EASIEST WAY TO

00:52:37.120 --> 00:52:38.688
CONCEPTUALIZE A POTENTIAL STATE

00:52:38.755 --> 00:52:41.892
BILL ON THIS ISSUE IS TO CODIFY

00:52:41.958 --> 00:52:43.627
THE HOLDING IN SMITH V.

00:52:43.693 --> 00:52:47.264

WE HAVE DATE OF BEING OF

00:52:51.101 --> 00:52:52.602
LET'S FIRST I CAN ACCEPT YOUR

00:52:52.669 --> 00:52:53.803
PREMISE THAT TWENTY PERCENT OF

00:52:53.870 --> 00:52:55.338
THE POPULATION IS WHAT'S GIVING

00:52:55.405 --> 00:52:56.740
THE STIGMA TO THIS LARGER

00:52:56.806 --> 00:52:58.909
POPULATION SURE ARE AND AMONG

SAID TWENTY PERCENT DO WE HAVE

00:53:00.343 --> 00:53:02.345
DATE OF HOW MUCH OF ITS OPIATE

00:53:02.412 --> 00:53:04.347
VERSUS MATH AND WHAT THAT

00:53:04.414 --> 00:53:07.150
LOOKS LIKE YET SO -- THIS IS A

00:53:07.217 --> 00:53:09.152
VERY VERY COMPLEX ISSUE TO TRY

00:55:35.265 --> 00:55:37.701
SUBSTANCE USE AND SO WE'RE ALSO

00:55:37.767 --> 00:55:39.502
LOOKING AT RE ENTRY SO WHEN

00:55:39.569 --> 00:55:40.970
THE PERSON HITS THE STREETS

00:55:41.037 --> 00:55:43.673
WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THEIR --

00:55:43.740 --> 00:55:45.175
WELL EQUIPPED WITH MEDICATION

00:55:45.241 --> 00:55:47.010
TO TIE THEM FOR PERIOD UNTIL

00:55:47.077 --> 00:55:48.545
THEY GET THEIR -- EITHER MEDI

00:55:48.611 --> 00:55:51.247

00:55:51.314 --> 00:55:56.453
SO THEY DON'T RELAPSE THANK YOU

00:55:56.519 --> 00:55:58.922
SO THIS I THINK IS WHERE WE GET

00:55:58.988 --> 00:56:02.292
INTO THE COMPLEXITIES OF WHO

00:56:02.358 --> 00:56:04.961
IS ON OUR STREETS WHO IS THE

00:56:05.028 --> 00:56:06.763
MOST VULNERABLE IN THE SENSE

00:56:06.830 --> 00:56:09.199
OF BEING REALLY CLOSE TO DEATH

00:56:09.265 --> 00:56:10.800
BECAUSE IF YOU'VE INTERFACED

00:56:10.867 --> 00:56:13.203
WITH ANYBODY WHO HAS -- THESE

00:56:13.269 --> 00:56:15.105
ADDICTIONS A OR A STEP AWAY

00:56:15.171 --> 00:56:17.707
FROM DEATH AND WE HAVEN'T EVEN

00:56:17.774 --> 00:56:20.343
TALKED ABOUT ALCOHOLISM SO --

00:56:20.410 --> 00:56:23.046
ADDICTIONS DO PLAY A ROLE I

00:56:23.113 --> 00:56:25.081
THINK WHAT YOU STARTED WITH

00:56:25.148 --> 00:56:27.150
THOUGH IS THE STIGMA THE STIGMA

00:56:27.217 --> 00:56:29.886
THAT'S ATTACHED TO WHETHER

00:56:29.953 --> 00:56:31.988
IT BE A MENTAL HEALTH ISSUE

00:56:32.055 --> 00:56:33.523
WHICH WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE

00:56:33.590 --> 00:56:36.860
MANY OF OUR THOSE EXPERIENCING

00:56:36.926 --> 00:56:38.561
HOMELESSNESS WHO DO HAVE

00:56:38.628 --> 00:56:40.430
MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES WE ALSO

00:56:40.497 --> 00:56:42.532
KNOW THAT THEY CAN HAVE MENTAL

00:56:42.599 --> 00:56:44.267
HEALTH ISSUES AND ADDICTION

00:56:44.334 --> 00:56:46.736

00:56:53.276 --> 00:56:56.246
INCLUDING HEALTH ISSUES -- SO

00:56:56.312 --> 00:56:58.047
YOU MAY HAVE INDIVIDUALS WHO

00:56:58.114 --> 00:57:00.316

00:57:02.152 --> 00:57:04.587
-- BUT -- SOME TYPE OF HEALTH

00:57:04.654 --> 00:57:07.223
ISSUE AND THAT WOULD BE --

00:57:07.290 --> 00:57:08.525
AS SOME OF THE OF NO I DON'T

00:57:19.536 --> 00:57:21.437
WANT TO SEE ANY OF YOUR FAMILY

00:57:21.504 --> 00:57:23.673
MEMBERS BUT THROUGH INTERFACE

00:57:23.740 --> 00:57:29.078
SCENE WITH A ALCOHOLISM AND

00:57:54.270 --> 00:57:55.972
IS NOT A REPUBLICAN OR DEMOCRAT

00:57:56.039 --> 00:57:58.107
ISSUE IT IS NOT A POLITICAL

00:57:58.174 --> 00:57:59.642

STOP DOING THOSE SERVICES AND

01:24:51.753 --> 01:24:52.554
THAT WOULD BE THE FUNDING WE

01:32:57.471 --> 01:32:59.073
NEW WITH OF COURSE WITH ADDING

01:32:59.140 --> 01:33:01.275
YOU -- EMERGENCY REGULATIONS

01:33:01.342 --> 01:33:02.843
TO ADDRESS A BUILDING THESE

01:33:02.910 --> 01:33:04.245
EMERGENCY SHELTERS THE ONE

01:33:04.312 --> 01:33:06.147
BILLION DOLLARS THAT YOU

01:33:06.213 --> 01:33:08.115
ALL HAVE PROVIDED -- AND SIX

01:33:08.182 --> 01:33:09.350
HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION GOING

01:33:09.417 --> 01:33:11.218
TO CITIES ABOUT MORE POORLY

01:33:11.285 --> 01:33:12.553
IT'S GOING TO THE THIRTEEN

01:33:12.620 --> 01:33:14.689
ON LARGEST CITIES I WOULD ASK

01:33:14.755 --> 01:33:16.424
AND IMPLORE YOU ALL TO LOOK

01:33:16.490 --> 01:33:17.992
AT SMALLER CITIES BECAUSE

01:33:18.059 --> 01:33:18.926
THOSE ARE THE ONES THAT ARE

01:33:18.993 --> 01:33:20.461
IMPACTED THE MOLES WITH THE

01:33:20.528 --> 01:33:22.396
LAST RESOURCES CITIES LIKE

01:33:22.463 --> 01:33:24.231
LA ORANGE AND BIG CITIES IN

01:33:24.298 --> 01:33:25.733
ORANGE COUNTY LIKE ANAHEIM IN

01:33:25.800 --> 01:33:28.235
SANTA ANA YOU KNOW HAVE MORE

01:33:28.302 --> 01:33:30.071
RESOURCES THAN A CITY LIKE

01:33:30.137 --> 01:33:32.573
WHEN A PARK AND SO OR LIKE A

01:33:32.640 --> 01:33:34.608
CITY LIKE COSTA MESA OR CITY

01:33:34.675 --> 01:33:37.211
LIKE WESTMINSTER THERE HAVE

01:33:37.278 --> 01:33:39.280
BEEN UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES

01:33:39.347 --> 01:33:41.015
ONE TIME FUNDS TO ADDRESSING

01:33:41.082 --> 01:33:42.817
HOMELESSNESS FOR SHELTERS IS

01:33:42.883 --> 01:33:45.386
NOT THE ANSWER AND AT THE STATE

01:33:45.453 --> 01:33:47.154
LEVEL A LOT OF THESE FUNDS WILL

01:33:47.221 --> 01:33:49.457
BE ONE TIME FUNDS CITIES CANNOT

01:33:49.523 --> 01:33:51.425
SUSTAIN THESE NEW SHELTERS

01:33:51.492 --> 01:33:53.594
WITH ONE TIME MONIES AND THESE

01:33:53.661 --> 01:33:54.662
ARE THE THINGS THAT WE BEEN

01:33:54.729 --> 01:33:56.263
ADDRESS ADDRESSING AT THE

01:33:56.330 --> 01:33:57.698
FEDERAL COURT AS CITIES HAVE

01:33:57.765 --> 01:33:59.934
BEEN A SETTLING POLICE AND FIRE

01:34:00.001 --> 01:34:01.969
COSTS WERE TALKED ABOUT WHEN

01:34:02.036 --> 01:34:03.037
WE'RE ADDRESSING THE HOMELESS

01:34:03.104 --> 01:34:05.106
COMMUNITY THAT IS PROBABLY THE

01:34:05.172 --> 01:34:06.907
BIGGEST COSTS FOR CITIES IS

01:34:06.974 --> 01:34:10.611
FIRE POLICE SERVICES AGAIN WE

01:34:10.678 --> 01:34:12.313
ARE ALSO NOT MAXIMIZING THE

01:34:12.380 --> 01:34:13.781
PUBLIC LAND THAT WE OWN WHETHER

01:34:13.848 --> 01:34:16.217
IT'S FEDERAL STATE OR LOCAL

01:34:16.283 --> 01:34:17.952
WE SHOULD BE MAXIMIZING JUST

01:34:18.019 --> 01:34:20.488
BUILDING A EMERGENCY SHELTER ON

01:34:20.554 --> 01:34:22.123
PUBLIC ON PUBLIC LAND WHETHER

01:34:22.189 --> 01:34:24.225
IT'S STATE OR LOCAL AND NOT

01:34:24.291 --> 01:34:25.493
BEING ABLE TO DO INTEGRATED

01:34:25.559 --> 01:34:28.029
HOUSING OR TAKING PROPERTY

01:34:28.095 --> 01:34:29.663
LIKE MOTELS OFF THE PROPERTY

01:34:29.730 --> 01:34:31.632
TAX ROLLS DOES NOT HELP THE

01:34:31.699 --> 01:34:33.367
CITY AND SO THESE ARE SOME

01:34:33.434 --> 01:34:34.769
OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE BEEN

01:34:34.835 --> 01:34:36.504
TALKING ABOUT AND SOME OF THE

01:34:36.570 --> 01:34:38.506
OTHER UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES

01:34:38.572 --> 01:34:39.740
THAT CREATED THIS HOMELESS

01:34:39.807 --> 01:34:41.675
CRISIS THAT I SEE BEFORE US IN

01:34:41.742 --> 01:34:42.710
THAT I BELIEVE THAT THE STATE

01:34:42.777 --> 01:34:44.145
LEGISLATURE COULD HELP LOCAL

01:34:44.211 --> 01:34:46.113
GOVERNMENT HERE TODAY AND THAT

01:34:46.180 --> 01:34:47.481
IS WHEN WE TALK ABOUT PROP

01:34:47.548 --> 01:34:50.384
THIRTEEN AND ALSO SB FIFTY ONE

01:34:50.451 --> 01:34:52.253
FIFTY FOUR AND AB EIGHT WHICH

01:34:52.319 --> 01:34:54.655
IS THE PROPERTY TAX ALLOCATION

01:34:54.722 --> 01:34:56.557
FORMULAS FOR CITIES NOT ALL

01:34:56.624 --> 01:34:58.826
CITIES ARE CREATED EQUAL AND

01:34:58.893 --> 01:35:00.294
SO CERTAIN CITIES GET CERTAIN

01:35:00.361 --> 01:35:02.263
PERCENT PERCENTAGE BACK ON

01:35:02.329 --> 01:35:04.031
PROPERTY TAX AND THAT'S NOT

01:35:04.098 --> 01:35:05.199
ENOUGH WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

01:35:05.266 --> 01:35:07.301
AFFORDABLE HOUSING WANTING

01:35:07.368 --> 01:35:09.503
TO BUILD YOU KNOW HOUSING

01:35:09.570 --> 01:35:11.205
PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING

01:35:11.272 --> 01:35:12.873
THAT COMES ALSO WITH ADDITIONAL

01:35:12.940 --> 01:35:15.910
RESOURCES FOR CITIES THESE

01:35:15.976 --> 01:35:17.611
FIRE PUBLIC WORKS PARKS AND

01:35:17.678 --> 01:35:20.347
RECREATION I CAN GO ON AND ON

01:35:20.414 --> 01:35:22.683
AND SO WHAT WE HAVE HERE IS

01:35:22.750 --> 01:35:24.685
A TEMPORARY SOLUTION THAT THE

01:35:24.752 --> 01:35:26.087
FEDERAL COURT IN ORANGE COUNTY

01:35:26.153 --> 01:35:27.588
HAS PROVIDED PROVIDING TWELVE

01:35:27.655 --> 01:35:29.957
HUNDRED TEMPORARY SHELTER BEDS

01:35:30.024 --> 01:35:33.060
IS NOT A FINAL SOLUTION FOR

01:35:33.127 --> 01:35:34.762
ORANGE COUNTY AND OR FOR THE

01:35:34.829 --> 01:35:36.163
REST OF THIS REGION OR THIS

01:35:36.230 --> 01:35:38.833
STATE I WOULD IMPLORE YOU

01:35:38.899 --> 01:35:40.401
ALL TO LOOK AT THESE FUNDING

01:35:40.468 --> 01:35:42.736
ALLOCATION SYSTEMS AND SYSTEMS

01:35:42.803 --> 01:35:43.904
FUNDING SYSTEMS THAT ARE

01:35:43.971 --> 01:35:45.673
SUSTAINABLE FOR CITIES NOW THAT

01:35:45.739 --> 01:35:47.608
WE'RE MOVING INTO THIS BUSINESS

01:35:47.675 --> 01:35:50.411
BECAUSE WE CANNOT IGNORE THIS

01:35:50.478 --> 01:35:52.746
ISSUE ANYMORE AS AS AS CITIES

01:35:52.813 --> 01:35:55.015
THAT IN FRONT OF OUR FACE THE

01:35:55.082 --> 01:35:57.218
PUBLIC DOESN'T CARE WHO THE

01:35:57.284 --> 01:35:58.652
JURISDICTION IS WHETHER IT'S

01:35:58.719 --> 01:35:59.987
THE COUNTY'S ROLE WHETHER IT'S

01:36:00.054 --> 01:36:01.822
A STATE ROLE OR FEDERAL WHILE

01:36:01.889 --> 01:36:03.023
THEY'RE LOOKING AT LOCAL CITY

01:36:03.090 --> 01:36:04.692
COUNCIL MEMBERS AND MAYORS AND

01:36:04.758 --> 01:36:06.293
SAY THIS IS YOUR JOB YOU BETTER

01:36:06.360 --> 01:36:08.529
ADDRESS IT AND SO WITH THAT YOU

01:36:08.596 --> 01:36:10.498
KNOW I JUST WANT TO IN IN IN

01:36:10.564 --> 01:36:12.466
THE PAST NINE MONTHS THAT I'VE

01:36:12.533 --> 01:36:14.368
BEEN WORKING WITH JUDGE CARTER

01:36:14.435 --> 01:36:15.870
ON ON TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

01:36:15.936 --> 01:36:18.739
WAYS TO HELP CITIES MAXIMIZE

01:36:18.806 --> 01:36:20.608
THEIR ABILITY AND REALLY

01:36:20.674 --> 01:36:22.910
ENDING AND SHOWING -- THE JUDGE

01:36:22.977 --> 01:36:25.179
CARTER THAT CITIES ARE BEING

01:36:25.246 --> 01:36:26.580
IMPACTED IN WAYS LIKE NEVER

01:36:26.647 --> 01:36:28.415
BEFORE WHETHER YOU'RE DEALING

01:36:28.482 --> 01:36:30.851
WITH PENSION PROBLEMS WITH

01:36:30.918 --> 01:36:32.786
PROP THIRTEEN THAT TOOK AWAY

01:36:32.853 --> 01:36:34.321
FORTY PERCENT OF CITIES LOCAL

01:36:34.388 --> 01:36:36.223
FUNDING THREE PERCENT F.

01:36:36.290 --> 01:36:37.458
FIFTY WITH THE LEGISLATURE

01:36:37.525 --> 01:36:38.926
PASSED IN REGARDS TO PENSIONS

01:36:38.993 --> 01:36:40.294
FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT ALL

01:36:40.361 --> 01:36:41.595
THOSE THINGS HAD UNINTENDED

01:36:41.662 --> 01:36:43.497
CONSEQUENCES FOR LOCAL

01:36:43.564 --> 01:36:47.401
MUNICIPALITIES AND SO I THINK

01:36:47.468 --> 01:36:50.404
THAT AS WE MOVE FORWARD THIS

01:36:50.471 --> 01:36:52.206
WILL NOT BE ADDRESSED WITHOUT

01:36:52.273 --> 01:36:53.841
ALSO THE CITY THE CITY'S

01:36:53.908 --> 01:36:58.312
ADMITTING THAT WE CHOSE NOT

01:36:58.379 --> 01:37:00.447
TO ZONE APPROPRIATELY FOR

01:37:00.514 --> 01:37:01.982
AFFORDABLE HOUSING BECAUSE

01:37:02.049 --> 01:37:03.717
NOT IN MY BACKYARD SO WE

01:37:03.784 --> 01:37:05.119
HAVE TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY

01:37:05.186 --> 01:37:07.288
FOR THAT THEY WE LACKED

01:37:07.354 --> 01:37:10.090
MANY OF US LACK THE COURAGE

01:37:10.157 --> 01:37:11.425
TO ADDRESS THE HOUSING

01:37:11.492 --> 01:37:14.461
NEEDS IN OUR COMMUNITIES

01:37:14.528 --> 01:37:15.963
THE AFFORDABILITY PROBLEMS

01:37:16.030 --> 01:37:18.632
THAT WE ARE FACING IN OUR

01:37:18.699 --> 01:37:22.269
COMMUNITIES ARE NOW CAUSING

01:37:22.336 --> 01:37:24.038
OTHER UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES

01:37:24.104 --> 01:37:25.139
LIKE SINGLE MOTHERS AND

01:37:25.206 --> 01:37:26.607
CHILDREN ARE ENDING UP HOMELESS

01:37:26.674 --> 01:37:27.775
THAT WE'VE NEVER SEEN AT

01:37:27.841 --> 01:37:30.377
LEVELS SO HIGH BEFORE WHEN I

01:37:30.444 --> 01:37:32.179
LOOK AT SANTA ANA AND I LOOK

01:37:32.246 --> 01:37:34.014
AT THE LINK AND TO SEE THE

01:37:34.081 --> 01:37:35.282
MOUNT OF CHILDREN THAT ARE

01:37:35.349 --> 01:37:36.450
IN THAT HOMELESS SHELTER WAS

01:37:36.517 --> 01:37:37.952
SINGLE MOTHERS OR IT'S AN

01:37:38.018 --> 01:37:39.687
AGING HOMELESS POPULATION IS

01:37:39.753 --> 01:37:43.023
CONTINUING TO RISE THIS IS JUST

01:37:43.090 --> 01:37:44.525
THE BEGINNING OF OUR PROBLEM

01:37:44.592 --> 01:37:45.693
BEFORE IT GETS BETTER IT'S

01:37:45.759 --> 01:37:47.194
GOING TO GET WORSE BECAUSE WE

01:37:47.261 --> 01:37:50.064
DO NOT HAVE THE HOUSING STOCK

01:37:50.130 --> 01:37:54.735
IN OUR COMMUNITIES TO SUSTAIN

01:37:54.802 --> 01:37:57.271
THE CURRENT GROWTH IN EACH

01:37:57.338 --> 01:38:00.474
OF OUR CITIES AND SO THIS IS

01:38:00.541 --> 01:38:02.876
NOT AN EASY JOB THIS IS NOT

01:38:02.943 --> 01:38:04.044
SOMETHING THAT THE STATE IS

01:38:04.111 --> 01:38:05.346
GOING TO BE ABLE TO SOLVE

01:38:05.412 --> 01:38:08.616
OVERNIGHT OR COUNTY GOVERNMENT

01:38:08.682 --> 01:38:11.318
OR THE CITY IT'S GOING TO TAKE

01:38:11.385 --> 01:38:13.487
ALL OF US TOGETHER WE ALL HAVE

01:38:13.554 --> 01:38:15.656
A ROLE TO PLAY BUT WE ALSO

01:38:15.723 --> 01:38:17.091
NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE

01:38:17.157 --> 01:38:19.460
CITY SHOULD SHOULD NOT BE THE

01:38:19.526 --> 01:38:21.962
LEADERS BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE

01:38:22.029 --> 01:38:23.998
SUSTAINABLE FUNDING STREAMS

01:38:24.064 --> 01:38:26.267
TO SUSTAIN WHAT WE HAVE BEFORE

01:38:26.333 --> 01:38:27.901
US AND SO WITH THAT I JUST

01:38:27.968 --> 01:38:29.403
WANT TO THANK YOU ALL FOR

01:38:29.470 --> 01:38:32.573
CONTINUING TO GO ON THIS TOUR

01:38:32.640 --> 01:38:33.574
A BECAUSE I HOPE THAT THIS

01:38:33.641 --> 01:38:35.442
IS JUST THE BEGINNING OF THIS

01:38:35.509 --> 01:38:37.745
SELECT COMMITTEES OF YOU KNOW

01:38:37.811 --> 01:38:39.446
TOUR HERE IN INTO AN ADDRESSING

01:38:39.513 --> 01:38:40.714
HOMELESSNESS IN HEARING FROM

01:38:40.781 --> 01:38:42.283
THE PUBLIC AND FROM THOSE

01:38:42.349 --> 01:38:43.250
THAT HAVE BEEN ADDRESSING

01:38:43.317 --> 01:38:45.052
HOMELESSNESS I'M NOT JUST IN

01:38:45.119 --> 01:38:46.186
THIS COUNTY BUT THROUGHOUT

01:38:46.253 --> 01:38:49.223
THIS ENTIRE REGION OF BECAUSE

01:38:49.290 --> 01:38:50.958
I REALLY BELIEVE THE ANSWER

01:38:51.025 --> 01:38:52.726
IS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL THOSE

01:38:52.793 --> 01:38:54.762
ADVOCATES THAT ARE WORKING

01:38:54.828 --> 01:38:56.363
WITH THE HOMELESS POPULATION

01:38:56.430 --> 01:38:58.632
OR THE NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS

01:38:58.699 --> 01:38:59.733
THAT HAVE BEEN ROLLING UP

01:38:59.800 --> 01:39:00.668
THEIR SLEEVES FOR TWENTY

01:39:00.734 --> 01:39:04.538
THIRTY YEARS THEY HAVE ALSO --

01:39:04.605 --> 01:39:06.907
IN THIS ISSUE BUT ONE SINGLE

01:39:06.974 --> 01:39:08.475
WHAT I BELIEVE AT THE END OF

01:39:08.542 --> 01:39:11.145
THE DAY THAT HAS BEEN MISSING

01:39:11.211 --> 01:39:13.514
IT'S IT'S THE REALLY THE COOP

01:39:13.580 --> 01:39:15.749
THE COOPERATION BETWEEN ALL

01:39:15.816 --> 01:39:17.584
LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT WE HAVE

01:39:17.651 --> 01:39:20.054
SEEN OVER THE PAST IN MY TWELVE

01:39:20.120 --> 01:39:22.356
YEARS OF OFFICE A DISCONNECT

01:39:22.423 --> 01:39:24.191
OF OF COMMUNICATING WITH OUR

01:39:24.258 --> 01:39:26.160
STATE LEGISLATORS WITH OUR

01:39:26.226 --> 01:39:28.629
COUNTY OFFICIALS IN WANTING

01:39:28.696 --> 01:39:30.464
TO ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS IN

01:39:30.531 --> 01:39:32.566
IN A COLLABORATIVE EFFORT

01:39:32.633 --> 01:39:34.034
AND SO HERE WE ARE TODAY BUT

01:39:34.101 --> 01:39:36.570
I BELIEVE AT THIS PRESENT

01:39:36.637 --> 01:39:40.674
MOMENT WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY

01:39:40.741 --> 01:39:42.543
TO HELP MITIGATE THE ISSUES

01:39:42.609 --> 01:39:44.278
THAT ARE BEFORE US IF WE

01:39:44.345 --> 01:39:48.482
COME TOGETHER SO THANK YOU

01:39:48.549 --> 01:39:49.616

-- I'D JUST LIKE TO MAKE A

01:39:55.155 --> 01:39:58.425
COMMENT REGARDING MIGHT NOT

ON THESE DAYS ARE DIFFICULT

01:40:12.773 --> 01:40:14.675
SCENARIOS THAT CITIES FACE AS

01:40:14.742 --> 01:40:16.143
FAR AS HOW DO YOU ALLOCATE YOUR

LOVE TO GO TO THE STATE THIS

01:40:30.057 --> 01:40:31.759
WAS JUST EMERGING SO WE DID

01:40:31.825 --> 01:40:33.761
NOT HAVE BUDGET DISCUSSIONS

01:40:33.827 --> 01:40:36.463
ABOUT YOU KNOW MERGING SEE

01:40:36.530 --> 01:40:38.699
SHELTERS ABOUT NAVIGATION

01:40:38.766 --> 01:40:40.634
CENTERS AS A MATTER OF FACT I

01:40:40.701 --> 01:40:43.270
WAS ON COUNCIL WE AND WE HAD

01:40:43.337 --> 01:40:45.038
THE DEATHS OF KELLY THOMAS

01:40:45.105 --> 01:40:48.041
AND IF THAT HAD NOT ONLY THAT

01:40:48.108 --> 01:40:50.611
THE IMPACT ON OUR COMMUNITY TO

01:40:50.677 --> 01:40:54.681
FOCUS ON ON A KELLY THOMAS WAS

01:40:54.748 --> 01:40:58.852
A SCHIZOPHRENIC MAN WHO MANY

01:40:58.919 --> 01:41:00.921
PEOPLE KNEW IN OUR CITY BUT

01:41:00.988 --> 01:41:03.323
IT ALSO FOCUSED OUR CITY ON

01:41:03.390 --> 01:41:06.560
ON POLICE REFORM AND FOCUSED

01:41:06.627 --> 01:41:07.594
OUR CITY ON WHAT ARE WE

01:41:07.661 --> 01:41:09.897
DOING WITH BEST PRACTICES FOR

01:41:09.963 --> 01:41:11.698
HOMELESSNESS AND IT WAS REALLY

01:41:11.765 --> 01:41:13.801
THE VERY BEGINNINGS OF THIS

01:41:13.867 --> 01:41:16.603
-- THAT HAS MATERIALIZED IN

01:41:16.670 --> 01:41:18.839
AND REALLY EXPLODED SO I KNOW

01:41:18.906 --> 01:41:20.441
THAT SOME OF THE LOCAL ELECTED

01:41:20.507 --> 01:41:22.743
OFFICIALS WHO HAVE HAD THE

01:41:22.810 --> 01:41:25.446
OPPORTUNITY OF SIR HAVE SEEN

01:41:25.512 --> 01:41:27.014
FROM IN MY CASE TWO THOUSAND

01:41:27.080 --> 01:41:28.515
FOUR TO NOW TWO THOUSAND

01:41:28.582 --> 01:41:32.085
NINETEEN A DRAMATIC SHIFT IN

01:41:32.152 --> 01:41:34.755
THE CONVERSATION BUT NOW WE

01:41:34.822 --> 01:41:36.023
HAVE SOMETHING IN FRONT OF US

01:41:36.089 --> 01:41:37.257
IN THE NEXT QUESTION IS WHAT DO

01:41:37.324 --> 01:41:39.226
WE DO ABOUT IT SO WITH THAT I

01:41:39.293 --> 01:41:45.466
WILL INTRODUCE OUR NEXT SORRY

01:41:45.532 --> 01:41:47.634
AS I DUG INTO IT I REALIZING

01:41:47.701 --> 01:41:48.902
SIMILAR TO WHAT YOU SAID AGAIN

01:41:48.969 --> 01:41:50.137
THERE'S A LOT OF CONFUSION IN

01:41:50.204 --> 01:41:52.639
TERMS OF WHAT IS THE ROLE AS

01:41:52.706 --> 01:41:56.143
THE STATE THE COUNTY CITIES

01:41:56.210 --> 01:41:57.845
ALL OF OUR ENGAGE NONPROFITS

01:41:57.911 --> 01:42:00.948
IN SOLVING NESS AND THE BEFORE

01:42:01.014 --> 01:42:02.015
WE CAN ACTUALLY BEFORE WE

01:42:02.082 --> 01:42:04.384
NEED CLARITY ON RESPONSIBILITY

01:42:04.451 --> 01:42:05.419
AND I THINK WE ALSO NEED TO

01:42:05.486 --> 01:42:08.088
MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE ALIGNING

01:42:08.155 --> 01:42:10.424
RESPONSIBILITY WITH RESOURCES

01:42:10.491 --> 01:42:12.960
SO IF YOU ARE STARTING WITH

01:42:13.026 --> 01:42:15.329
IN A BLANK SLATE WHAT DO

01:42:15.395 --> 01:42:17.598
YOU THINK IS THE ROLE AS THE

01:42:17.664 --> 01:42:21.301
CITY'S VERSES THE COUNTY IN

01:42:21.368 --> 01:42:23.237
BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ADDRESSING

01:42:23.303 --> 01:42:26.807
HOMELESSNESS IN ORANGE COUNTY

01:42:26.874 --> 01:42:28.742
WE SHOULD SUPPORT OUR LAND

01:42:28.809 --> 01:42:31.378
USE AND ZONING TO ACCOMMODATE

01:42:31.445 --> 01:42:33.680
HOMELESS SHELTERS NAVIGATION

01:42:33.747 --> 01:42:34.648
CENTERS WHATEVER WE WANT TO

01:42:34.715 --> 01:42:36.383
CALL THEM PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE

01:42:36.450 --> 01:42:38.085
HOUSING ATTAINABLE I DON'T

01:42:38.151 --> 01:42:39.186
CALL IT AFFORDABLE HOUSING A

01:42:39.253 --> 01:42:40.354
CALL ATTAINABLE HOUSING THE

01:42:40.420 --> 01:42:42.289
THE -- THOSE ARE THE THINGS

01:42:42.356 --> 01:42:43.957
THAT CITIES SHOULD BE ABLE TO

01:42:44.024 --> 01:42:46.460
SUPPORT YOU KNOW AS A BURKE

01:42:46.527 --> 01:42:48.695
PERTAINS TO MENTAL HEALTH THAT

01:42:48.762 --> 01:42:49.897
IS NOT IN OUR PREVIEW THAT'S

01:42:49.963 --> 01:42:50.898
NOT SOMETHING THAT WE CAN DO

01:42:50.964 --> 01:42:52.833
OUR POLICE STRUGGLE OUR FIRE

01:42:52.900 --> 01:42:54.835
STRUGGLE ON THAT IS MORE BY

01:42:54.902 --> 01:42:56.937
COUNTY ROLE SO I THINK FROM

01:42:57.004 --> 01:42:58.438
BEING ABLE TO BE SUPPORTED

01:42:58.505 --> 01:43:00.173
TO DESIGNATE THE LAND USES

01:43:00.240 --> 01:43:01.942
AND SONY TO ACCOMMODATE THE

01:43:02.009 --> 01:43:04.144
HOUSING THAT WE NEED IS THE

01:43:04.211 --> 01:43:07.281
CITY'S ROLE ARE CAN WE PROVIDE

01:43:07.347 --> 01:43:08.982
-- CBG GRANT FUNDING THAT'S

01:43:09.049 --> 01:43:10.183
GIVEN TO US FROM THE FEDS AND

01:43:10.250 --> 01:43:13.020
STATE FOR -- HOMELESS SHELTERS

01:43:13.086 --> 01:43:14.521
IN PROVIDER MONIES THAT WAY

01:43:14.588 --> 01:43:15.822
AND LEVERAGE THEM HOWEVER WE

01:43:15.889 --> 01:43:17.424
POSSIBLY CAN WITH THE COUNTY

01:43:17.491 --> 01:43:19.626
WE SHOULD DEFINITELY DO THAT --

01:43:19.693 --> 01:43:21.194
SO I THINK THAT IS THE INITIAL

01:43:21.261 --> 01:43:23.163
ROLE BUT TODAY THAT HAS CHANGED

01:43:23.230 --> 01:43:24.698
WE'RE NOW IN THE BUSINESS OF

01:43:24.765 --> 01:43:26.800
BUILDING HOMELESS SHELTERS

01:43:26.867 --> 01:43:28.435
WHICH WE CANNOT SUSTAIN WE

01:43:28.502 --> 01:43:29.536
HAVE TO BE HONEST ABOUT THAT

01:43:29.603 --> 01:43:30.971

ALL THESE CODE ENFORCEMENT

01:43:42.449 --> 01:43:44.251
TEAMS OUT THERE IN PARTNERSHIP

01:43:44.318 --> 01:43:46.253
WITH OUR POLICE ARE ARE PARKS

01:43:46.320 --> 01:43:48.522
AND REC AND THE MORE MORE WE

01:43:48.589 --> 01:43:50.290
GROW THE MORE MORE SERVICES

01:43:50.357 --> 01:43:52.259
LOCAL MUNICIPALITIES NEED AND

01:43:52.326 --> 01:43:53.860
THERE'S NOT ENOUGH -- REVENUE

01:43:53.927 --> 01:43:57.497
COMING IN TO SUSTAIN THAT

01:43:57.564 --> 01:43:59.366

SO I HAVE AT NINE CITIES TO ARE

01:44:03.971 --> 01:44:05.339
GRAPPLING WITH THE SITUATION

01:44:05.405 --> 01:44:07.174
ALSO AND ARE TRYING TO BE

01:44:07.240 --> 01:44:08.742
PROACTIVE ON AND ARE WORKING

01:44:08.809 --> 01:44:10.611
DIRECTLY WITH JUDGE CARTER IN

01:44:10.677 --> 01:44:11.812
OUR NOT HAVING THAT DISCUSSION

01:44:11.878 --> 01:44:12.813
THAT THEY HAVE GONE INTO THE

01:44:12.879 --> 01:44:14.581
BUSINESS OF HOMELESSNESS BUT

01:44:14.648 --> 01:44:15.482
THEY'RE DOWN FACING WITH THE

01:44:15.549 --> 01:44:16.750
REALITY OF HOW DO WE PAY FOR

01:44:16.817 --> 01:44:18.318
THIS FOR A WHILE THE FELLOW

01:44:18.385 --> 01:44:20.053
THEY'RE NOT EQUIPPED WITH

01:44:20.120 --> 01:44:21.588
THE SKILL SET BUT BE THERE

01:44:21.655 --> 01:44:22.456
DEFINITELY THINKING ABOUT

01:44:22.522 --> 01:44:23.223
THOSE DOLLARS WHERE THEY'RE

01:44:23.290 --> 01:44:24.925
GOING TO COME FROM BUT THEY'RE

01:44:24.992 --> 01:44:26.026
HEARING FROM THE CONSTITUENTS

01:44:26.093 --> 01:44:26.960
AND THEY SAID THAT THEY CAN'T

01:44:27.027 --> 01:44:28.128
WAIT FOR ALL OF US FIGURE IT

01:44:28.195 --> 01:44:29.429
OUT THE COUNTY FOR ALL OF ITS

01:44:29.496 --> 01:44:30.931
BECAUSE HER FIGHT TO SEE AN

01:44:30.998 --> 01:44:31.999
ACTION BUT THERE'S A LOT OF

01:44:32.065 --> 01:44:33.467
STRESS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL NOW

01:44:33.533 --> 01:44:37.671
IS HE TAKING THIS ACTION IF

01:44:37.738 --> 01:44:38.672
AND THERE'S DIFFERENT MODELS

01:44:38.739 --> 01:44:39.940
I MEAN IF THE FUNDING COMES

01:44:40.007 --> 01:44:41.408
AND IT'S A STATE OF WILL TO

01:44:41.475 --> 01:44:43.076
THE CITY'S BE IN THE BUSINESS

01:44:43.143 --> 01:44:44.211
OF RUNNING THESE OPERATIONS

01:44:44.277 --> 01:44:45.412
ARE SHOULD IT SHOULD BE IN

01:44:45.479 --> 01:44:47.247
THE COUNTY OR SOMEBODY ELSE IS

01:44:47.314 --> 01:44:48.281
ALSO PART OF THE QUESTION THAT

01:44:48.348 --> 01:44:49.983
THERE THAT WE'RE GRAPPLING WITH

01:44:50.050 --> 01:44:52.953
AND SO WHAT WOULD HE SAY THAT

01:44:53.020 --> 01:44:54.888
SO I WOULD SAY THAT TODAY'S

01:44:54.955 --> 01:44:56.323
A NEW DAY WORD TWENTY FIRST

01:44:56.390 --> 01:44:58.225
CENTURY GOVERNMENT AND WE'VE

01:44:58.291 --> 01:44:59.926
NOW ARE STEPPING UP TO TAKE

01:44:59.993 --> 01:45:02.362
ON THIS ROLE AND SO I WOULD

01:45:02.429 --> 01:45:05.432
SAY THAT YES CITIES CAN BUILD

01:45:05.499 --> 01:45:07.434
THE BRICK AND MORTAR IT IT IS

01:45:07.501 --> 01:45:09.002
KIND OF PRIVATIZING IT OUT TO

01:45:09.069 --> 01:45:10.537
NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS WHETHER

01:45:10.604 --> 01:45:12.205
TO LIMÓN NATION FOUNDATION

01:45:12.272 --> 01:45:14.675
MERCY HOUSE ON AND SO FORTH

01:45:14.741 --> 01:45:17.044
IF WE HAVE THE LONG TERM

01:45:17.110 --> 01:45:18.779
SUSTAINABLE FUNDING STREAM

01:45:18.845 --> 01:45:20.047
TO GIVE THOSE MONIES TO THOSE

01:45:20.113 --> 01:45:22.883
NONPROFIT I DON'T SEE WHY NOT

01:45:22.949 --> 01:45:25.052
A CITY CANNOT PARTNER WITH

01:45:25.118 --> 01:45:26.553
UP THE PRIVATE WITH WITH THE

01:45:26.620 --> 01:45:27.888
NONPROFIT I CALL IN A P.

01:45:27.954 --> 01:45:29.322
FOR NOT A P. THREE WHICH

01:45:29.389 --> 01:45:30.624
IS A PEOPLE PUBLIC PRIVATE

01:45:30.691 --> 01:45:32.359
PARTNERSHIP THE THE PEOPLE

01:45:32.426 --> 01:45:33.593
ARE THE HOMELESS COMMUNITY IN

01:45:33.660 --> 01:45:35.862
HAVING AND ENSURING THAT WHAT

01:45:35.929 --> 01:45:37.831
THEIR NEEDS ARE I THINK WHEN WE

01:45:37.898 --> 01:45:39.666
LOOK AT BUILDING ON EMERGENCY

01:45:39.733 --> 01:45:41.334
SHELTER AND THE BUT THIS VERY

01:45:41.401 --> 01:45:43.370
CITIES IN YOUR CITY AND MY

01:45:43.437 --> 01:45:45.005
GOOD FRIEND WAS THE MAYOR OF

01:45:45.072 --> 01:45:47.074
JUAN GARCIA BELLFLOWER HAD THIS

01:45:47.140 --> 01:45:48.375
CONVERSATION WITH THEM FOR OVER

01:45:48.442 --> 01:45:49.676
A YEAR AND WE'RE BEEN ABLE TO

01:45:49.743 --> 01:45:52.045
BRING HIM WITH JUDGE CARTER WAS

01:45:52.112 --> 01:45:54.347
THAT WE CANNOT CLOSE OUR EYES

01:45:54.414 --> 01:45:56.917
WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING RIGHT

01:45:56.983 --> 01:46:00.153
SO I WOULD SAY THAT YES WE CAN

01:46:00.220 --> 01:46:02.456
MOVE TOWARDS SUSTAINABILITY IF

01:46:02.522 --> 01:46:05.258
THE STATE IS COMMITTED TO GET

01:46:05.325 --> 01:46:08.528
A NOSE ONGOING RESOURCES TO

01:46:08.595 --> 01:46:09.996
SUSTAIN THE OPERATIONS BECAUSE

01:46:10.063 --> 01:46:11.164
THAT'S WHAT COST THE MOST WHEN

01:46:11.231 --> 01:46:12.132
YOU'RE GIVING US THE ONE TIME

01:46:12.199 --> 01:46:13.533
FUNDS FOR BRICK AND MORTAR THAT

01:46:13.600 --> 01:46:15.001
IS FANTASTIC THAT'S EASY TO TO

01:46:15.068 --> 01:46:16.937
NO BRAINER BUT IT'S THE ONGOING

01:46:17.003 --> 01:46:20.173
COST SO A LOT OF THESE GRANTS

01:46:20.240 --> 01:46:22.776
THERE'S A SUNSET SO WHAT'S NEXT

01:46:22.843 --> 01:46:24.478
AFTER THIS BILLION DOLLARS IS

01:46:24.544 --> 01:46:26.079
GONE WHAT ARE CITIES GOING TO

01:46:26.146 --> 01:46:28.048
DO I GUESS THAT'S THE QUESTION

01:46:28.115 --> 01:46:30.317
THAT EVERY ELECTED OFFICIAL IN

01:46:30.383 --> 01:46:31.651
YOUR DISTRICT SHOULD BE ASKING

01:46:31.718 --> 01:46:33.220
AND THEY SHOULD PUT A PAUSE

01:46:33.286 --> 01:46:35.288
OR CAN THEY LEVERAGE THEIR

01:46:35.355 --> 01:46:36.990
RESOURCES AND SAY HEY WE'RE

01:46:37.057 --> 01:46:38.225
GONNA USE PUBLIC SAFETY WE'RE

01:46:38.291 --> 01:46:39.192
GONNA BE LIKE NORTH ORANGE

01:46:39.259 --> 01:46:41.294
COUNTY CREATE THIS PARTNERSHIP

01:46:41.361 --> 01:46:43.764
A GPA AND SAY HATE FIVE CITIES

01:46:43.830 --> 01:46:44.798
ARE GOING TO COME TOGETHER AND

01:46:44.865 --> 01:46:46.566
SHARE PUBLIC SAFETY RESOURCES

01:46:46.633 --> 01:46:47.701
WE'RE GOING TO SHARE AND

01:46:47.768 --> 01:46:50.137
LEVERAGE OUR CBG FUNDING AND

01:46:50.203 --> 01:46:52.072
AND PUT IT TOGETHER AND CREATE

01:46:52.139 --> 01:46:54.307
-- A SYSTEM THAT HELPS ONE

01:46:54.374 --> 01:46:56.409
THE HELP EACH OF THE CITIES SO

01:46:56.476 --> 01:46:59.045
THAT ONE CITY DOESN'T AND KERR

01:46:59.112 --> 01:47:01.448
MOST OF THE COSTS AND SO YOU

01:47:01.515 --> 01:47:02.983
KNOW I BELIEVE THE NORTH ORANGE

01:47:03.049 --> 01:47:05.218
COUNTY SPOT MODEL IS AN OPTION

01:47:05.285 --> 01:47:06.720
-- BUT AS BUT AT THE END OF THE

01:47:06.787 --> 01:47:08.688
DAY I DO BELIEVE THAT EVERYONE

01:47:08.755 --> 01:47:10.757
PLAYS A ROLE IN THIS BUT AGAIN

01:47:10.824 --> 01:47:11.892
IT'S GOING TO COME DOWN TO

01:47:11.958 --> 01:47:13.693
LONG TERM SUSTAINABLE FUNDING

01:47:13.760 --> 01:47:16.062
FOR CITIES AND SO WE'VE WE'VE

01:47:16.129 --> 01:47:17.164
HAD THE DISCUSSION ABOUT THE

01:47:17.230 --> 01:47:18.665
SHELTERS WHICH IS THE EMERGENCY

01:47:18.732 --> 01:47:19.766
HOUSING BUT THERE'S BEEN

01:47:19.833 --> 01:47:21.868
MULTIPLE COMMENTS TODAY BEING

01:47:21.935 --> 01:47:23.603
MADE BY A NUMBER OF PANELISTS

01:47:23.670 --> 01:47:24.838
THE CITY MANAGER THAT WE HAVE

01:47:24.905 --> 01:47:26.106
A HOUSE IS A PLACE YOU KNOW WE

01:47:26.173 --> 01:47:27.307
NEED AFFORDABLE HOUSING THAT'S

01:47:27.374 --> 01:47:29.075
MORE PERMANENT FOR INDIVIDUALS

01:47:29.142 --> 01:47:30.343
WOULD ALL HAVE THIS CONTINUOUS

01:47:30.410 --> 01:47:34.147
CYCLE GOING ON IS A FIFTY TO

01:47:34.214 --> 01:47:35.682
SAY THAT WE'RE GOING TO GIVE

01:47:35.749 --> 01:47:37.083
YOU A SINGLE SOURCE OF FUNDING

01:47:37.150 --> 01:47:39.452
FOR THIS EMERGENCY SHELTERS

01:47:39.519 --> 01:47:40.453
YOU SHOULD BE WE SHOULD BE

01:47:40.520 --> 01:47:41.655
MANDATED SOME SORT OF SIGNING

01:47:41.721 --> 01:47:42.956
TO GUARANTEE THAT WE ARE ABLE

01:47:43.023 --> 01:47:45.091
TO FILL THE I MEAN WE HAVE A

01:47:45.158 --> 01:47:46.293
DENSITY ISSUE COMMUNITIES LIKE

01:47:46.359 --> 01:47:47.994
MINE I WOULD GO BEYOND JUST

01:47:48.061 --> 01:47:49.162
EMERGENCY SHELTERS YOU NEED

01:47:49.229 --> 01:47:51.164
INTEGRATED HOUSING RIGHT SO YOU

01:47:51.231 --> 01:47:52.599
BUILD SO THIS IS WHERE I TALK

01:47:52.666 --> 01:47:54.100
ABOUT MAXIMIZING YOUR LAND IF

01:47:54.167 --> 01:47:55.435
YOU'RE GOING TO MATCH MY STATE

01:47:55.502 --> 01:47:57.437
FEDERAL OR LOCAL LAND YOU WANT

01:47:57.504 --> 01:47:59.105
TO DO INTEGRATED HOUSING BUILD

01:47:59.172 --> 01:48:00.807
A SHELTER AT THE BOTTOM AND

01:48:00.874 --> 01:48:04.077
AND AND DO YOU KNOW SINGLE I

01:48:04.144 --> 01:48:06.313
FORGET WHAT THEY'RE CALLED --

01:48:06.379 --> 01:48:08.949
SINGLE ROOM OCCUPANCY AND OTHER

01:48:09.015 --> 01:48:11.318
WRAPAROUND SERVICES SO YOU CAN

01:48:11.384 --> 01:48:13.220
MAXIMIZE YOUR LAN AND MAXIMIZE

01:48:13.286 --> 01:48:16.056
YOUR RESOURCES AND LEVERAGE

01:48:16.122 --> 01:48:17.624
AS MUCH AS YOU POSSIBLY CAN

01:48:17.691 --> 01:48:19.826
BUT JUST BUILDING AN EMERGENCY

01:48:19.893 --> 01:48:21.995
SHELTER AND SPENDING MILLIONS

01:48:22.062 --> 01:48:23.730
OF DOLLARS AND THEN TRYING

01:48:23.797 --> 01:48:24.764
TO FIGURE OUT OKAY WHERE AM

01:48:24.831 --> 01:48:26.933
I GONNA FIND GLAND TODAY BILL

01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:28.301
PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING

01:48:28.368 --> 01:48:29.603
ON AND SO FORTH I THINK IF WE

01:48:29.669 --> 01:48:31.104
WANT TO INDUSTRY HOMELESSNESS

01:48:31.171 --> 01:48:32.339
WE HAVE TO LOOK AT INTEGRATED

01:48:32.405 --> 01:48:35.742
MODELS AND AND AND UNDERSTAND

01:48:35.809 --> 01:48:37.978
THAT SPEAK SPECIFICALLY IN YOUR

01:48:38.044 --> 01:48:40.413
AREA ASSEMBLY GARCIA YOU GUYS

01:48:40.480 --> 01:48:42.582
HAVE A SMALL FOOTPRINT RIGHT

01:48:42.649 --> 01:48:43.783
SO YOU GUYS ARE PRETTY BUILT

01:48:43.850 --> 01:48:45.018
OUT YOU'RE GOING TO EITHER HAVE

01:48:45.085 --> 01:48:46.820
TO GO UP AND LOOK AT THE LAND

01:48:46.887 --> 01:48:47.921
THAT YOU HAVE AVAILABLE BUT

01:48:47.988 --> 01:48:49.589
YOU CAN'T JUST BUILD A SHELTER

01:48:49.656 --> 01:48:51.524
STAND ALONE AND THEN TRY TO

01:48:51.591 --> 01:48:52.759
FIND SOMEWHERE ELSE TO BUILD

01:48:52.826 --> 01:48:54.160
PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING

01:48:54.227 --> 01:48:55.061
BECAUSE IT'S NEVER GOING TO

01:48:55.128 --> 01:48:56.897
PENCIL OUT AND SO I AGREE WE

01:48:56.963 --> 01:48:58.465
NEED TO BE BUILDING AL AND

01:48:58.531 --> 01:49:00.300
SO I'M HAPPY TO SEE THAT MY

01:49:00.367 --> 01:49:01.601
CITIES ARE STARTING TO TAKE

01:49:01.668 --> 01:49:03.036
HIS PRACTICE STEPS AND I THINK

01:49:03.103 --> 01:49:04.638
AT A MINIMUM ABOUT THE RAPPER

01:49:04.704 --> 01:49:05.906
OF AT THE SHELTER CENTER AND

01:49:05.972 --> 01:49:07.874
IT'S NOT ENOUGH FOR A WHILE

01:49:07.941 --> 01:49:09.075
WHEN I GOT ELECTED SEVEN YEARS

01:49:09.142 --> 01:49:10.176
AGO WE WE DON'T EVEN HAVE

01:49:10.243 --> 01:49:11.044
HOMELESS PEOPLE HERE AND I

01:49:11.111 --> 01:49:13.146
THINK OR DO YOU SO THEY OPEN

01:49:13.213 --> 01:49:14.314
THEIR EYES A LITTLE BIT RIGHT

01:49:14.381 --> 01:49:15.782
AND SO PROGRESS THEY'RE NOT

01:49:15.849 --> 01:49:17.083
HAVE OTHER MY CITIES IN THAT

01:49:17.150 --> 01:49:18.385
WHO ARE NOT TAKING BOTH HOURS

01:49:18.451 --> 01:49:21.254
LEAD -- AS WELL BUT THERE'S

01:49:21.321 --> 01:49:22.722
THIS BIG FIGHT AGAIN ABOUT

01:49:22.789 --> 01:49:24.024
BUILDING UP IN MY CITIES HAVE

01:49:24.090 --> 01:49:25.091
ALSO BEEN AT THE FOREFRONT OF

01:49:25.158 --> 01:49:27.560
FIGHTING THE BUILDUP MODEL AND

01:49:27.627 --> 01:49:28.395
BUT THIS KIND OF KNOW WHERE

01:49:28.461 --> 01:49:30.230
ELSE TO OTHER RIGHTS I THOUGHT

01:49:30.297 --> 01:49:31.431
THE STATE I WANT TO HELP MY

01:49:31.498 --> 01:49:33.333
CITIES GET THAT CONTINUOUS

01:49:33.400 --> 01:49:35.468
APPROPRIATION MANY DENTAL TO DO

01:49:35.535 --> 01:49:36.436
THE RIGHT THING AFTER THINKING

01:49:36.503 --> 01:49:37.671
ABOUT BUILDING UP AND HOW DO WE

01:49:37.737 --> 01:49:39.673
GET COMMUNITIES TO DO THAT AND

01:49:39.739 --> 01:49:40.573
BE READY FOR THAT BECAUSE THE

01:49:40.640 --> 01:49:42.242
ABILITY THE CHARGE AGAINST THIS

01:49:42.309 --> 01:49:43.410
IDEA OF BUILDING UP BUT THERE'S

01:49:43.476 --> 01:49:44.778
NOWHERE ELSE TO BUILD TO STEP

01:49:44.844 --> 01:49:47.013
COULD I LIVE IN IN MY HOMETOWN

01:49:47.080 --> 01:49:48.415
SORT OF THE DEFICIT PUTS IN

01:49:48.481 --> 01:49:51.818
THE WHOLE COUNTRY EXACTLY

01:49:51.885 --> 01:49:54.521
ALL RIGHT SO WE OURS NOW REALLY

01:49:54.587 --> 01:49:56.556
STARTING TO BE BEHIND ON TIME

01:49:56.623 --> 01:49:58.024

01:49:58.091 --> 01:49:59.926

WRAP UP THE WHOLE PROGRAM BY

01:50:13.039 --> 01:50:14.374
ELEVEN THIRTY SO THAT WOULD

01:50:14.441 --> 01:50:15.575

01:51:45.832 --> 01:51:47.300
OF HOMELESSNESS WITH MULTIPLE

01:51:47.367 --> 01:51:50.703

01:55:19.112 --> 01:55:20.947
OF OUR PROBLEM IN THAT PEOPLE

DON'T NECESSARILY KNOW WHERE

01:55:22.482 --> 01:55:24.517

THAT FIVE MINUTES I PROMISE

01:55:47.507 --> 01:55:49.442
SO COMMUNITY CORRECTIONS ON

01:55:49.509 --> 01:55:51.210
STEPPING UP INITIATIVE WE'VE

THE INFRASTRUCTURE WASN'T

01:57:27.173 --> 01:57:29.675
THERE TO RESPOND EFFECTIVELY

01:57:29.742 --> 01:57:31.944
TO THOSE NEEDS IN OUR COMMUNITY

01:57:32.011 --> 01:57:33.246
AND SO WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT

01:57:33.312 --> 01:57:34.347
AND WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

01:57:34.414 --> 01:57:37.950
OFTENTIMES IS HOMELESSNESS

01:57:38.017 --> 01:57:40.219
BUT I I I I ASK YOU TO NOT

LOOK AT HOMELESSNESS AS THE

01:57:42.255 --> 01:57:44.724
PROBLEM HOMELESSNESS IS THE

01:57:44.791 --> 01:57:47.794
SYMPTOM OF THE PROBLEM THE

01:57:47.860 --> 01:57:49.529
PROBLEM IS ACTUALLY LOOKING

01:57:49.595 --> 01:57:52.432
AT THE LOTS OF REDEVELOPMENT

01:57:52.498 --> 01:57:53.900
TWO THOUSAND EIGHT AND TEN

01:57:53.966 --> 01:57:55.468
YEARS OF CITIES NOT HAVING

01:58:07.079 --> 01:58:08.648
LEGISLATIVE DIALOGUE GOING ON

01:58:08.714 --> 01:58:10.349
IT'S VERY PROACTIVE AROUND THE

01:58:10.416 --> 01:58:12.819
OVERSIGHT OF THESE THINGS --

01:58:12.885 --> 01:58:15.254

OF OVERSIGHT AND I WON'T GO

01:58:42.315 --> 01:58:44.250
SO FAR TO SAY ACCREDITATION

01:58:44.317 --> 01:58:46.419
OF A TREATMENT SYSTEM THAT CAN

01:58:46.486 --> 01:58:48.120
EFFECTIVELY RESPOND TO WHAT

01:58:48.187 --> 01:58:49.689

02:00:19.111 --> 02:00:20.246
AN INITIATIVE THAT I BROUGHT

02:00:20.313 --> 02:00:21.747
FORWARD IN MY ASSESSMENT TWO

02:00:21.814 --> 02:00:23.783
THOUSAND SIXTEEN I BELIEVE

02:00:23.849 --> 02:00:25.418
AND I I THINK I CONCUR WITH

02:00:25.484 --> 02:00:26.419
WITH EVERYONE WHO'S HERE

02:00:26.485 --> 02:00:27.820
REPRESENTING A CITY THAT NO

02:00:27.887 --> 02:00:29.188
ONE CITY IS GOING TO SOLVE

02:00:29.255 --> 02:00:30.890
HOMELESSNESS INDEPENDENTLY

02:00:30.957 --> 02:00:32.858
OF THEIR NEIGHBORS AND THAT

02:00:32.925 --> 02:00:34.260
THE NOR SERVICE PLANNING AREA

02:00:34.327 --> 02:00:36.329
HAS BEEN EFFECTIVELY ABLE TO

02:00:36.395 --> 02:00:38.364
CREATE A A SUBSTANTIAL MO YOU

02:00:38.431 --> 02:00:40.433
TO PARTNER AND SHARE ON THIS

02:00:40.499 --> 02:00:42.368
EVEN COLLECTIVELY REQUIRING THE

02:00:42.435 --> 02:00:44.337
COUNTY'S RESOURCES TO MAKE THAT

02:00:44.403 --> 02:00:46.672
A REALITY -- AND SO I'M SUPER

02:00:46.739 --> 02:00:48.374
PROUD OF THE NORTH -- SPOTS

02:00:48.441 --> 02:00:49.742
CITIES TO BE ABLE TO PULL THAT

02:00:49.809 --> 02:00:51.410
TOGETHER FINE TO APPROPRIATE

02:00:51.477 --> 02:00:53.346
LOCATIONS AND EFFECTIVELY

02:00:53.412 --> 02:00:54.981
ACKNOWLEDGING REALIZE THAT

02:00:55.047 --> 02:00:56.482
THAT HOMELESSNESS IS A REGIONAL

02:00:56.549 --> 02:00:58.851
ISSUE AND YOU KNOW THIS THIS

02:00:58.918 --> 02:01:00.486
IDEA OF TRYING TO ESTABLISH

02:01:00.553 --> 02:01:03.489
A RESIDENCY -- IMPACT FOR A

02:01:03.556 --> 02:01:05.324
PERSON ENTERING A SHELTER IS

02:01:05.391 --> 02:01:07.026
VERY VERY CHALLENGING TO SAY

02:01:07.093 --> 02:01:08.160
WELL YOU'RE FROM HERE YOU

02:01:08.227 --> 02:01:10.963
CAN YOU KNOW -- THE RESIDENCY

02:01:11.030 --> 02:01:12.565
PIECES VERY DIFFICULT BUT WE

02:01:12.632 --> 02:01:14.066
HAVE TO ADDRESS THE PEOPLE

02:01:14.133 --> 02:01:15.735
THAT ARE IN OUR COMMUNITIES

02:01:15.801 --> 02:01:17.903
THAT IS THE BOTTOM LINE -- IN

02:01:17.970 --> 02:01:19.905
OF ADDRESS THEM PROACTIVELY

02:01:19.972 --> 02:01:21.073
SO WITH THE SHELTERS BEING

02:01:21.140 --> 02:01:22.441
DEVELOPED THE AMOUNT OF MONEY

02:01:22.508 --> 02:01:24.343
THAT'S BEING EXPENDED FOR THE

02:01:24.410 --> 02:01:26.379
SHELTER SYSTEM HAS ME AND MANY

02:01:26.445 --> 02:01:28.447
OTHERS CONCERNED THAT WE NEED

02:01:28.514 --> 02:01:30.983
AN EXIT FROM THE SHELTER SYSTEM

02:01:31.050 --> 02:01:33.853
-- AND SO WITH THAT -- GO TO

02:01:33.919 --> 02:01:35.388
THE GO TO THE HOMELESS COUNT

02:01:35.454 --> 02:01:37.189
NUMBERS JUST QUICKLY BACK TO

02:01:37.256 --> 02:01:41.127
THE HOMELESS COUNT -- SO IN

02:01:41.193 --> 02:01:42.561
THE IN THE ON SHELTER NUMBER OF

02:01:42.628 --> 02:01:44.463
THIRTY NINE SIXTY ONE AND ALL

02:01:44.530 --> 02:01:45.798
ALL SAY TO YOU THAT THESE ARE

02:01:45.865 --> 02:01:47.833
THE MOST ACCURATE FIGURES WE'VE

02:01:47.900 --> 02:01:49.135
EVER SEEN AN ORANGE COUNTY

02:01:49.201 --> 02:01:50.436
BECAUSE WE TALKED TO EVERY

02:01:50.503 --> 02:01:52.204
HOMELESS PERSON THAT WE CAME

02:01:52.271 --> 02:01:55.141
ACROSS IN THE COUNTY -- GIS MAP

02:01:55.207 --> 02:01:56.909
LOCATIONS FOR WHERE THE SURVEYS

02:01:56.976 --> 02:01:58.678
WERE COMPLETED I AM TOLD I NEED

02:01:58.744 --> 02:02:01.814
TO STOP AND I HAVE -- TWO MORE

02:02:01.881 --> 02:02:05.818
MINUTES YES ME THANK YOU -- AND

02:02:05.885 --> 02:02:07.253
I WILL SAY TO YOU THAT ON THE

02:02:07.319 --> 02:02:08.587
SHELTERED COUNT THERE WERE SIX

02:02:08.654 --> 02:02:09.989
HUNDRED ADDITIONAL BEDS IN TWO

02:02:10.056 --> 02:02:11.223
THOUSAND NINETEEN THAT DID NOT

02:02:11.290 --> 02:02:12.892
EXIST IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN

02:02:12.958 --> 02:02:14.026
AND THERE'S PROBABLY ANOTHER

02:02:14.093 --> 02:02:15.895
FIVE TO SIX HUNDRED BEDS THAT

02:02:15.961 --> 02:02:17.663
WERE NOT HERE IN TWO THOUSAND

02:02:17.730 --> 02:02:19.699
NINETEEN THAT ARE HERE NOW OR

02:02:19.765 --> 02:02:21.867
IN THE PIPELINE AND SO I'LL SAY

02:02:21.934 --> 02:02:23.502
TO YOU AT SOME POINT WE NEED TO

02:02:23.569 --> 02:02:25.571
PIVOT FROM DEVELOPMENT OF THE

02:02:25.638 --> 02:02:27.106
SHELTER SYSTEM WHICH I THINK

02:02:27.173 --> 02:02:28.274
YOU KNOW AND I I WANT TO PAUSE

02:02:28.340 --> 02:02:29.809
TO SAY SOME OTHER COMMUNITIES

02:02:29.875 --> 02:02:31.744
CALL ME REGULARLY FROM AROUND

02:02:31.811 --> 02:02:33.479
THE STATE AND SAY YOU KNOW

02:02:33.546 --> 02:02:34.847
HOW WERE YOU ABLE TO DEVELOP

02:02:34.914 --> 02:02:36.382
ALL THE SHELTER BEDS BECAUSE

02:02:36.449 --> 02:02:38.684
THEY ARE YEARNING TO CREATE AN

02:02:38.751 --> 02:02:40.386
URGENT RESPONSE TO THE STREET

02:02:40.453 --> 02:02:42.455
POPULATION IN ORANGE COUNTY IS

02:02:42.521 --> 02:02:45.057
SUCCESSFULLY IN THE IN THE A

02:02:45.124 --> 02:02:47.126
MODE OF DOING SO AND YOU KNOW

02:02:47.193 --> 02:02:48.828
WE WE TAKE A LITTLE CRITICISM

02:02:48.894 --> 02:02:50.296
THERE BECAUSE IT'S NOT HOUSING

02:02:50.362 --> 02:02:52.298
FIRST AND I I UNDERSTAND THAT

02:02:52.364 --> 02:02:53.733
BUT WE'VE GOT TO ADDRESS THE

02:02:53.799 --> 02:02:55.034
PEOPLE THAT ARE CURRENTLY

02:02:55.101 --> 02:02:56.902
HOMELESS IN OUR COMMUNITIES

02:02:56.969 --> 02:02:58.637
BY PROVIDING EMERGENCY SHELTER

02:02:58.704 --> 02:03:00.840
PIECE -- FROM MY PERSPECTIVE

02:03:00.906 --> 02:03:02.908
IT'S TIME TO PIVOT FROM THOSE

02:03:02.975 --> 02:03:04.143
THAT ARE IN THE PIPELINE AND

02:03:04.210 --> 02:03:06.479
BEING FULLY DEVELOPED -- THOSE

02:03:06.545 --> 02:03:08.514
WILL BE THE SHELTER SYSTEM

02:03:08.581 --> 02:03:10.015
GOING FORWARD I DON'T KNOW HOW

02:03:10.082 --> 02:03:11.717
MANY MORE THOSE WE ULTIMATELY

02:03:11.784 --> 02:03:13.219
NEED BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE

02:03:13.285 --> 02:03:14.153
DAY WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO HAVE

02:03:14.220 --> 02:03:15.821
IT AND GET INTO THE PERMANENT

02:03:15.888 --> 02:03:17.623
HOUSING AND THE SYSTEM OF CARE

02:03:17.690 --> 02:03:19.024
RIGHT NOW IS HOUSING ABOUT

02:03:19.091 --> 02:03:20.292
FORTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE

02:03:20.359 --> 02:03:22.128
NEAT THE PEOPLE THAT ARE IN

02:03:22.194 --> 02:03:23.529
OUR SYSTEM THAT ARE WORKING

02:03:23.596 --> 02:03:25.464
PROGRAMS THAT ARE UNABLE TO

02:03:25.531 --> 02:03:27.767
IDENTIFY YOUR SECURE HOUSING IS

02:03:27.833 --> 02:03:30.703
SIXTY FIVE PERCENT SO A FIFTY

02:03:30.770 --> 02:03:32.171
FIVE PERCENT SORRY I MESSED

02:03:32.238 --> 02:03:35.307
THAT UP -- SO WITH THAT WHEN

02:03:35.374 --> 02:03:37.343
WE PUT PEOPLE INTO PERMANENT

02:03:37.409 --> 02:03:38.677
HOUSING PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE

02:03:38.744 --> 02:03:40.012
HOUSING THE RETENTION RATES

02:03:40.079 --> 02:03:42.915
NINETY NINE PERCENT SO YES

02:03:42.982 --> 02:03:44.316
HOUSING WORKS HOUSING IS THE

02:03:44.383 --> 02:03:46.385
SOLUTION TO HOMELESSNESS --

02:03:46.452 --> 02:03:48.154
BUT MOVING FORWARD FROM THERE

02:03:48.220 --> 02:03:49.989
I WANT TO GO TO -- I'M GONNA

02:03:50.055 --> 02:03:51.157
SKIP THAT YOU ALL KNOW WHERE

02:03:51.223 --> 02:03:52.725
THE BEDS ARE IN THE NORTH PART

02:03:52.792 --> 02:03:55.661
OF THE COUNTY -- REALLY QUICKLY

02:03:55.728 --> 02:03:57.463
PREVENTION WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

02:03:57.530 --> 02:03:59.899
HOMELESSNESS THAT'S THE SYMPTOM

02:03:59.965 --> 02:04:01.734
THE ISSUE IS PREVENTION ON THE

02:04:01.801 --> 02:04:03.936
FRONT END A MINIMUM OF TWENTY

02:04:04.003 --> 02:04:05.671
TWO PERCENT OF OUR POPULATIONS

02:04:05.738 --> 02:04:07.106
THAT HAVE BECOME HOMELESS

02:04:07.173 --> 02:04:08.174
IN THE TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN

02:04:08.240 --> 02:04:09.909
COUNT I BECAME HOMELESS IN THE

02:04:09.975 --> 02:04:11.911
LAST TWELVE MONTHS SO WE'VE

02:04:11.977 --> 02:04:13.312
GOT TO DO MORE ON THE FRONT

02:04:13.379 --> 02:04:14.814
END AND YOU KNOW THE FEDERAL

02:04:14.880 --> 02:04:17.616
GOVERNMENT HAS SOMEWHAT A ROAD

02:04:17.683 --> 02:04:19.485
ID THE PREVENTION RESOURCES

02:04:19.552 --> 02:04:20.986
DUE TO THE LACK OF RESEARCH

02:04:21.053 --> 02:04:23.455
THAT PREVENTION IS EFFECTIVE

02:04:23.522 --> 02:04:25.524
SO YOU'LL SEE THAT OUR OUR

02:04:25.591 --> 02:04:27.259
SYSTEMS ACROSS THE STATE ARE

02:04:27.326 --> 02:04:29.295
ARE SOMEWHAT UNDER UNDER FUNDED

02:04:29.361 --> 02:04:30.696
WITH REGARDS TO PREVENTION

02:04:30.763 --> 02:04:31.931
AND DIVERSION ON THE FRONT

02:04:31.997 --> 02:04:33.599
END AND I'M HOPEFUL THAT OUR

02:04:33.666 --> 02:04:35.234
CONTINUUM OF CARE JURISDICTION

02:04:35.301 --> 02:04:36.936
WILL TAKE A A GOOD STRONG LOOK

02:04:37.002 --> 02:04:38.604
AT THAT WITH REGARDS TO THE

02:04:38.671 --> 02:04:40.206
STATE FUNDING COMING DOWN IT'S

02:04:40.272 --> 02:04:41.974
ONE TIME MONEY PREVENTION IS

02:04:42.041 --> 02:04:45.578
A VERY -- -- EFFECTIVE TOOL I

02:04:45.644 --> 02:04:46.779
WILL TALK ABOUT HOMELESSNESS

02:04:46.846 --> 02:04:48.247
ROSE TALKING ABOUT HOUSING WE

02:04:48.314 --> 02:04:49.682
NEED TO TALK ABOUT INCOME AS

02:04:49.748 --> 02:04:51.483
WELL WE HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE

02:04:51.550 --> 02:04:52.618
IT WAS SAID EARLIER THAT

02:04:52.685 --> 02:04:53.853
ARE CURRENTLY EXPERIENCING

02:04:53.919 --> 02:04:54.920
HOMELESSNESS THAT DON'T HAVE

02:04:54.987 --> 02:04:57.289
AN INCOME AT ALL -- THERE'S A

02:04:57.356 --> 02:04:59.024
TO A TON OF REASONS FOR THAT

02:04:59.091 --> 02:05:00.125
WHICH I DON'T HAVE THE TIME TO

02:05:00.192 --> 02:05:01.560
GO INTO BUT I WILL SAY TO YOU

02:05:01.627 --> 02:05:02.761
THAT WE HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE

02:05:02.828 --> 02:05:04.430
EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS IN

02:05:04.496 --> 02:05:05.798
THIS JURISDICTION AND ACROSS

02:05:05.865 --> 02:05:07.666
THE STATE THAT ARE DISABLED

02:05:07.733 --> 02:05:09.468
THEY ARE CLEARLY DISABLED

02:05:09.535 --> 02:05:10.803
THEY'RE NOT RECEIVING GENERAL

02:05:10.870 --> 02:05:12.037
RELIEF BUT THEY'RE ALSO NOT

02:05:12.104 --> 02:05:13.606
RECEIVING FEDERAL DISABILITY

02:05:13.672 --> 02:05:15.040
PAYMENTS AND SO THAT'S WHERE

02:05:15.107 --> 02:05:16.842
THAT OTHER PLANE FLIES NEXT TO

02:05:16.909 --> 02:05:19.478
US IS THE FEDERAL DISABILITY

02:05:19.545 --> 02:05:21.847
SYSTEM IS VERY VERY CHALLENGING

02:05:21.914 --> 02:05:23.249
IF NOT IMPOSSIBLE FOR A

02:05:23.315 --> 02:05:24.950
HOMELESS PERSON TO NAVIGATE

02:05:25.017 --> 02:05:26.819
IT'S QUITE IMPOSSIBLE SOMETIMES

02:05:26.886 --> 02:05:28.520
EVEN FOR CASE MANAGEMENT TO

02:05:28.587 --> 02:05:30.256
NAVIGATE THAT ON BEHALF OF OUR

02:05:30.322 --> 02:05:32.625
CLIENTS -- TRUTH BE KNOWN AND

02:05:32.691 --> 02:05:33.993
THEREFORE WE TRAIN PEOPLE WHAT

02:05:34.059 --> 02:05:35.394
THE SORE PROGRAM TO BE ABLE TO

02:05:35.461 --> 02:05:37.396
NAVIGATE THAT BUT IT REQUIRES

02:05:37.463 --> 02:05:39.131
MEDI CAL IT REQUIRES A PRIMARY

02:05:39.198 --> 02:05:41.300
CARE PROVIDER AND IT PROVIDES

02:05:41.367 --> 02:05:43.068
A YOU KNOW A HISTORY OF MEDICAL

02:05:43.135 --> 02:05:45.070
CARE THE DOCUMENTS ALONG AND

02:05:45.137 --> 02:05:47.373
WAS STANDING DISABILITY -- I

02:05:47.439 --> 02:05:48.641
TALKED ABOUT THE LINK TO STAY

02:05:48.707 --> 02:05:50.509
IN SHELTERS THIS IS -- PROBABLY

02:05:50.576 --> 02:05:52.611
A NUMBER ONE OR TOP FIVE ISSUE

02:05:52.678 --> 02:05:54.613
FOR ME IN A IN MONITORING THE

02:05:54.680 --> 02:05:56.048
SHELTER THE GROWING SHELTER

02:05:56.115 --> 02:05:57.783
SYSTEM AND HOW LONG PEOPLE

02:05:57.850 --> 02:05:59.051
ARE STAYING THERE AND WHETHER

02:05:59.118 --> 02:06:01.587
THEY'RE EXITING SUCCESSFULLY OR

02:06:01.654 --> 02:06:03.822
NOT -- GIVEN THE LENGTH OF STAY

02:06:03.889 --> 02:06:05.324
IT'S DIFFICULT TO STAY IN A

02:06:05.391 --> 02:06:06.859
SHELTER LONG TERM IF YOU DON'T

02:06:06.926 --> 02:06:09.228
SEE THE OUTCOME OF FORESEEABLE

02:06:09.295 --> 02:06:10.696
IN YOUR STAY THERE MOVING

02:06:10.763 --> 02:06:13.666
FORWARD TO THE NEXT SLIDE

02:06:13.732 --> 02:06:15.734
I'M AND I DID TALK ABOUT THE

02:06:15.801 --> 02:06:17.403
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CARE SYSTEM

02:06:17.469 --> 02:06:18.737
LET ME SEE IF THERE'S ANYTHING

02:06:18.804 --> 02:06:21.140
ELSE -- THE MAT PROGRAM WAS

02:06:21.206 --> 02:06:23.075
TALKED ABOUT EARLIER BIG STRONG

02:06:23.142 --> 02:06:25.577
-- PROPONENT OF THAT -- YOU

02:06:25.644 --> 02:06:26.745
KNOW WE'RE DEALING WITH AN OP

02:06:26.812 --> 02:06:28.414
A CRISIS IN OUR COMMUNITIES

02:06:28.480 --> 02:06:30.149
BUT IN OUR COUNTRY AND YOU'RE

02:06:30.215 --> 02:06:31.917
NEVER WOULD WE THOUGHT -- HOW

02:06:31.984 --> 02:06:35.020
DO WE SITE -- METHADONE CLINICS

02:06:35.087 --> 02:06:37.189
IN OUR COMMUNITIES SO TRYING

02:06:37.256 --> 02:06:38.757
TO DECIDE A HOMELESS SHELTERS

02:06:38.824 --> 02:06:41.260
CHALLENGING -- BUT CITING A

02:06:41.327 --> 02:06:43.362
METHADONE CLINIC CITING CRISIS

02:06:43.429 --> 02:06:45.064
STABILIZATION UNITS CITING

02:06:45.130 --> 02:06:47.166
A SOBERING CENTER AT CETERA

02:06:47.232 --> 02:06:48.968
THESE ARE THINGS THAT REQUIRE

02:06:49.034 --> 02:06:50.469
COMMUNITY EDUCATION THEY

02:06:50.536 --> 02:06:52.604

02:06:54.139 --> 02:06:55.040
THESE THINGS ARE BETTER THAN

02:06:55.107 --> 02:06:56.542
THE ALTERNATIVE WHICH IS

THE TALK OF HOUSING FIRST --

02:09:10.809 --> 02:09:11.944
IT WOULD BE MY PREFERENCE THAT

02:09:12.010 --> 02:09:13.612
WE CAN SERVE A PERSON ONCE AND

02:09:13.679 --> 02:09:16.048
SERVE THEM SUCCESSFULLY AND SO

02:09:16.115 --> 02:09:17.583
DATA INTEGRATION IS SOMETHING

02:09:17.649 --> 02:09:18.784
THAT WILL BE REQUIRED THE

COUNTY IS ENGAGING IN THE VERY

02:09:20.919 --> 02:09:23.155
EARLY STAGES OF THIS TO IMPROVE

02:09:23.222 --> 02:09:25.057

02:09:33.198 --> 02:09:34.399
TO BE ABLE TO SERVE THE MOST

02:09:34.466 --> 02:09:36.268
VULNERABLE FIRST -- BECAUSE

02:09:36.335 --> 02:09:37.503
YOU KNOW WE'VE GOT PEOPLE THAT

02:09:37.569 --> 02:09:39.571

02:09:39.638 --> 02:09:42.007
THAT WITHOUT THE ASSISTANCE OF

02:09:42.074 --> 02:09:44.042
THE SYSTEM OF CARE WOULD NOT BE

02:09:44.109 --> 02:09:46.211
ABLE TO NAVIGATE THE COMPLEXITY

02:09:46.278 --> 02:09:48.814
OF THE CURRENT SYSTEM -- AND SO

02:09:48.881 --> 02:09:51.583
IN SUMMARY AND TO FINISH -- MY

02:09:51.650 --> 02:09:54.119
MY TOP FOUR LIST THAT I'VE GOT

02:09:54.186 --> 02:09:56.021
HERE'S THE OVERSIGHT CAPACITY

02:09:56.088 --> 02:09:57.623
BUILDING FOR THE SUBSTANCE

02:09:57.689 --> 02:10:00.092
ABUSE TREATMENT SYSTEM ON THAT

02:10:00.159 --> 02:10:02.594
IS CRITICAL TO OUR SUCCESS

02:10:02.661 --> 02:10:04.530
-- THE THE MENTAL HEALTH

02:10:04.596 --> 02:10:07.065
SIGNIFICANT IMPAIRMENT POPULAR

02:10:07.132 --> 02:10:08.233
WE HAVE A POPULATION WAS

02:10:08.300 --> 02:10:09.768
SUCH A SIGNIFICANT IMPAIRMENT

02:10:09.835 --> 02:10:11.036
THAT EVEN THE DISCUSSION OF

02:10:11.103 --> 02:10:12.604
PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING IS

02:10:12.671 --> 02:10:15.040
NOT UNNECESSARILY REALISTIC AND

02:10:15.107 --> 02:10:16.642
SO WERE WERE FREQUENTLY LOOKING

02:10:16.708 --> 02:10:18.644
FOR THIS COMMUNITY BASED

02:10:18.710 --> 02:10:20.546
OUR RESPONSE WERE APPROACH

CARE ISSUES COMING UP A LOT

02:10:23.615 --> 02:10:25.017
IN THE RE ENTRY DISCUSSION

02:10:25.083 --> 02:10:26.285
ALSO COMING UP IN THE MENTAL

02:10:26.351 --> 02:10:28.020
HEALTH DISCUSSION AROUND THE

02:10:28.086 --> 02:10:29.688
MEDI CAL REIMBURSEMENT RATES

02:10:29.755 --> 02:10:32.591
BEING LOWER -- FOR FOR THOSE

02:10:32.658 --> 02:10:33.959
-- CONDITIONS FOR THE MENTAL

02:10:34.026 --> 02:10:35.227
HEALTH CONDITION AND MAYBE IT

02:10:35.294 --> 02:10:36.995
WOULD BE FOR DEVELOPMENTALLY

02:10:37.062 --> 02:10:39.164
DISABLED POPULATION AND I

02:10:39.231 --> 02:10:41.934
I'M NOT SURE WHY -- BUT YOU

02:10:42.000 --> 02:10:43.302
KNOW WE WE REALLY NEED TO

02:10:43.368 --> 02:10:44.803
MAXIMIZE THE RESOURCES THAT

02:10:44.870 --> 02:10:45.771
WE HAVE AVAILABLE IN OUR

02:10:45.837 --> 02:10:47.839
COMMUNITIES AND THEN ON THE RE

02:10:47.906 --> 02:10:50.242
ENTRY SIDE -- FUNDING FOR RE

02:10:50.309 --> 02:10:52.411
ENTRY SPECIFICALLY RELATED TO

02:10:52.477 --> 02:10:55.180
EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING BECAUSE

02:10:55.247 --> 02:10:56.848
IN THE HOMELESS SYSTEM OF CARE

02:10:56.915 --> 02:10:58.850
WE'VE GOT PEOPLE WITH CRIMINAL

02:10:58.917 --> 02:11:00.652
JUSTICE BACKGROUNDS AND WE'VE

02:11:00.719 --> 02:11:02.688
GOT PEOPLE WITH RE ENTRY NEEDS

02:11:02.754 --> 02:11:04.189
THAT ARE NOT REALLY GETTING

02:11:04.256 --> 02:11:05.757
THEIR NEEDS MET IN THE HOMELESS

02:11:05.824 --> 02:11:07.292
SYSTEM IN THE IN THE SHELTER

02:11:07.359 --> 02:11:10.028
SYSTEM PER SE AND SO I I REALLY

02:11:10.095 --> 02:11:12.464
BELIEVE THAT THERE IS A -- A

02:11:12.531 --> 02:11:14.466
DIFFERENT SET OF SOLUTIONS FOR

02:11:14.533 --> 02:11:16.835
PEOPLE IN RE ENTRY A SMALLER

02:11:16.902 --> 02:11:19.071
ENVIRONMENT A SOBRE ENVIRONMENT

02:11:19.137 --> 02:11:20.505
A PLACE WHERE LIFE SKILLS

02:11:20.572 --> 02:11:22.040
AND FINANCIAL LITERACY ARE

02:11:22.107 --> 02:11:24.409
PARAMOUNT TO A PERSON ACTUALLY

02:11:24.476 --> 02:11:25.944
WORKING FOR AN EMPLOYER WHO

02:11:26.011 --> 02:11:28.080
TAKES BALANCE AND A HOUSING

02:11:28.146 --> 02:11:31.149
PROGRAM THAT ALSO TAKES FELONS

02:11:31.216 --> 02:11:33.352
-- AND SO IT'S JUST NOT --

02:11:33.418 --> 02:11:34.653
SUFFICIENT TO SAY THAT WE'RE

02:11:34.720 --> 02:11:36.355
JUST CAN INTEGRATE ALL OF THAT

02:11:36.421 --> 02:11:38.190
INTO THE HOMELESS SYSTEM AND

02:11:38.257 --> 02:11:39.825
HOPE THAT OUR SERVICE PROVIDERS

02:11:39.891 --> 02:11:42.728
CAN MANAGE THE COMPLEXITY ALL

02:11:42.794 --> 02:11:45.030
IN ONE LOCATION -- I THINK

02:11:45.097 --> 02:11:48.867
THAT IS A RECIPE FOR MULTIPLE

02:11:48.934 --> 02:11:50.302
CHALLENGES FROM THE HEALTH

02:11:50.369 --> 02:11:52.170

02:13:50.889 --> 02:13:52.791
IN A LOT OF THOSE DISCUSSIONS

02:13:52.858 --> 02:13:55.026
-- SOMETIMES GET ASKED TO

02:13:55.093 --> 02:13:59.798
LEAVE IN THE SOUTH COUNTY --

02:13:59.865 --> 02:14:01.600
THERE'S A DIALOGUE GOING ON

02:14:01.666 --> 02:14:03.769
ACROSS THIS COUNTY IN ALL THREE

02:14:03.835 --> 02:14:05.837
SERVICE PLANNING AREAS I THINK

02:14:05.904 --> 02:14:07.305
IN THE SOUTH SERVICE PLANNING

02:14:07.372 --> 02:14:08.673
YOUR IT FROM MY PERSPECTIVE

02:14:08.740 --> 02:14:11.243
THEY HAVE A LOT LESS OF A

02:14:11.309 --> 02:14:13.145
VISIBLE PROBLEM THAN WHAT WE

02:14:13.211 --> 02:14:15.614
SEE IN CENTRAL AND NORTH SO

02:14:15.680 --> 02:14:17.749
THEY'RE A LITTLE BIT LATE TO

02:14:17.816 --> 02:14:20.452
THE TABLE ON HAVING TO REACT

02:14:20.519 --> 02:14:23.121
OR RESPOND TO SIGNIFICANT

02:14:23.188 --> 02:14:24.723
ISSUES IN THEIR COMMUNITIES

02:14:24.790 --> 02:14:28.160
BECAUSE IT'S FAIRLY -- ISOLATED

02:14:28.226 --> 02:14:30.495
-- AND SPREAD OUT AND WHEN

02:14:30.562 --> 02:14:31.830
YOU LOOK AT SOUTH COUNTY I

02:14:31.897 --> 02:14:33.532
MEAN IT'S NOT A A TRANSIT

02:14:33.598 --> 02:14:35.300
FRIENDLY ENVIRONMENT IF YOU'RE

02:14:35.367 --> 02:14:37.035
HOMELESS YOU WANT TO BE IN AN

02:14:37.102 --> 02:14:38.503
ENVIRONMENT WHERE YOU CAN HAVE

02:14:38.570 --> 02:14:41.139
ACCESS TO TRANSPORTATION AND

02:14:41.206 --> 02:14:43.341
FOOD AND RESOURCES AND YOU KNOW

02:14:43.408 --> 02:14:45.076
IT YOU'RE YOU'RE IN KIND OF

02:14:45.143 --> 02:14:46.878
A URBAN AREA WHEN YOU GET TO

02:14:46.945 --> 02:14:48.647
SOUTH COUNTY IT'S IT'S QUITE A

02:14:48.713 --> 02:14:50.582
WALK FROM A TO B.

02:14:50.649 --> 02:14:52.384
AND SO THE POPULATION THERE

02:14:52.451 --> 02:14:54.753
IS KIND OF A CONGREGATING

02:14:54.820 --> 02:14:57.222
AROUND THE COASTAL AREAS OF

02:14:57.289 --> 02:14:58.623
OUR COMMUNITY AND AND I WOULD

02:14:58.690 --> 02:15:00.325
SAY THAT THAT'S TRUE ACROSS

02:15:00.392 --> 02:15:02.394
THE STATE I COME FROM THE CITY

02:15:02.461 --> 02:15:03.962
LONG BEACH FOR FOURTEEN YEARS

02:15:04.029 --> 02:15:06.231
AND EVERY COASTAL CITY HAS A

02:15:06.298 --> 02:15:08.500
LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT MIGRATORY

02:15:08.567 --> 02:15:10.368
PATTERN OF HOMELESS POPULATIONS

02:15:10.435 --> 02:15:12.637
USING A BEACH AMENITIES AND

02:15:12.704 --> 02:15:14.606
ASSETS AS WELL AS THE ISOLATION

02:15:14.673 --> 02:15:16.475
OF THE BEACHES AT NIGHT FOR

02:15:16.541 --> 02:15:17.943
A SLEEPING AND THINGS OF THAT

02:15:18.009 --> 02:15:19.611
NATURE SO YOU KNOW THE ISSUES

02:15:19.678 --> 02:15:21.680
ARE A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT

02:15:21.746 --> 02:15:23.081
ON THE COASTAL SIDE THAN WHAT

02:15:23.148 --> 02:15:24.816
YOU WOULD SEE IN THE BROADER

02:15:24.883 --> 02:15:26.651
SELF SERVICE PLANNING EVERY

MOST OF THOSE CITIES HAVE VERY

02:15:28.119 --> 02:15:30.055
FEW HOMELESS PEOPLE THERE AND

02:15:30.121 --> 02:15:31.656

02:20:34.159 --> 02:20:35.493
HAVE A CLEANING AND PICKING

02:20:35.560 --> 02:20:37.562
UP ON ON THIS I THINK TENSION

02:20:37.629 --> 02:20:39.531
BETWEEN CITY RESPONSIBILITY IN

02:20:39.597 --> 02:20:40.632
COUNTY RESPONSIBILITY BECAUSE

02:20:40.698 --> 02:20:42.600
I DO FEEL LIKE THERE ARE SOME

02:20:42.667 --> 02:20:43.768
CITIES THAT ARE REALLY GETTING

02:20:43.835 --> 02:20:45.103
CAUGHT IN THIS CATCH TWENTY TWO

02:20:45.170 --> 02:20:46.271
BECAUSE FOR FOR SOMETHING TO

02:20:46.337 --> 02:20:47.105
HAPPEN I THINK THERE'S GONNA

02:20:47.172 --> 02:20:48.139
THREE LEGS OF THE STOOL IN

02:20:48.206 --> 02:20:49.974
THE FIRST IS POLITICAL WILL

02:20:50.041 --> 02:20:52.243
AND LEADERSHIP THE SECOND IS

02:20:52.310 --> 02:20:54.179
AN ACTUAL PLAN THEN THE THIRD

02:20:54.245 --> 02:20:56.514
IS RESOURCES AND FUNDING AND

02:20:56.581 --> 02:20:57.849
I DO THINK THERE ARE EXAMPLES

02:20:57.916 --> 02:20:59.317
IN THE COUNTY WHERE THERE ARE

02:20:59.384 --> 02:21:00.852
CITIES WHO HAVE DEMONSTRATED

02:21:00.919 --> 02:21:02.620
POLITICAL WELL AND LEADERSHIP

02:21:02.687 --> 02:21:04.522
WHERE THEY DO HAVE A PLAN THAT

02:21:04.589 --> 02:21:05.690
THEY HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO

02:21:05.757 --> 02:21:07.258
GET ANY RESOURCES ARE FUNDING

02:21:07.325 --> 02:21:08.393
AND THEY'RE FINDING THEMSELVES

02:21:08.459 --> 02:21:10.762
NOW CAUGHT HOLDING THE BAG FOR

02:21:10.829 --> 02:21:12.463
YOU BECAUSE MAYES EVER EXAMPLE

02:21:12.530 --> 02:21:13.832
THIRTEEN MILLION DOLLARS GOING

02:21:13.898 --> 02:21:15.300
TO THEIR GENERAL FUND AND

02:21:15.366 --> 02:21:17.101
THEN ONE OTHER CITY SEE THAT

02:21:17.168 --> 02:21:18.736
THAT MAKES CITIES LIKE NEWPORT

02:21:18.803 --> 02:21:20.405
BEACH HUNTINGTON BEACH MISSION

02:21:20.471 --> 02:21:22.273
VIEJO DANA POINT SAN CLEMENTE

02:21:22.340 --> 02:21:24.042
THEY'RE EVEN LESS LIKELY TO

02:21:24.108 --> 02:21:25.543
WANT TO MOVE FORWARD WITH A

02:21:25.610 --> 02:21:26.845
SOLUTION WHEN THEY GO OH MY

02:21:26.911 --> 02:21:29.013
GOD I'M GONNA I'M GONNA PUT MY

02:21:29.080 --> 02:21:30.949
NECK ON THE LINE FROM MY FROM

02:21:31.015 --> 02:21:32.984
MY CONSTITUENTS I'M GONNA MOVE

02:21:33.051 --> 02:21:34.219
FORWARD ON THIS PLAN AND THEN

02:21:34.285 --> 02:21:35.520
I'M GONNA HAVE A GIANT HOLE IN

02:21:35.587 --> 02:21:37.422
MY GENERAL FUND THAT NO ONE'S

02:21:37.488 --> 02:21:40.091
FELLING SO HOW DO WE HOW DO WE

02:21:40.158 --> 02:21:42.460
FIGURE OUT THAT RATE FORMULA

02:21:42.527 --> 02:21:44.062
AND MAKE SURE THAT CITIES BACK

02:21:44.128 --> 02:21:45.997
TO THE CITY MANAGER'S POINT

02:21:46.064 --> 02:21:46.998
THAT CITIES THAT ARE DOING

02:21:47.065 --> 02:21:48.700
THE RIGHT THING ARE GETTING

02:21:48.766 --> 02:21:51.536
REWARDED ONE ABSOLUTELY I WOULD

02:21:51.603 --> 02:21:52.670
-- I WOULD ALIGN WITH THAT

02:21:52.737 --> 02:21:53.938
SENTIMENT AND YOU KNOW WHEN YOU

02:21:54.005 --> 02:21:56.641
TALK ABOUT COSTA MESA -- YOU

02:21:56.708 --> 02:21:59.077
KNOW THERE INITIATIVE WAS ON

02:21:59.143 --> 02:22:01.079
THE HEELS AND TO THE TAIL END

02:22:01.145 --> 02:22:02.647
OF WHEN THE FIRST ROUND OF HE

02:22:02.714 --> 02:22:04.549
CAME AND THEY MISSED THAT THEY

02:22:04.616 --> 02:22:07.485
JUST MISSED THAT COMPLETELY AND

02:22:07.552 --> 02:22:09.020
YOU KNOW THAT OPPORTUNITY THE

02:22:09.087 --> 02:22:10.421
WAY THAT THE CONTINUUM OF CARE

02:22:10.488 --> 02:22:12.657
BOARD WAS ALLOCATING THAT MONEY

02:22:12.724 --> 02:22:14.626
WAS REALLY NOT ALLOCATING IT

02:22:14.692 --> 02:22:16.861
BUT PARKING IT IN NORTH PARKING

02:22:16.928 --> 02:22:18.763
IN CENTRAL PARKING IN SOUTH

02:22:18.830 --> 02:22:20.832
AND SAYING EVERYONE HAS ACCESS

02:22:20.899 --> 02:22:23.434
EVERYONE SHOULD APPLY -- AND I

02:22:23.501 --> 02:22:24.669
THINK IN THE FIRST WHEN YOU HAD

02:22:24.736 --> 02:22:26.404
TO CALL THE SHELTER CRISIS AND

02:22:26.471 --> 02:22:27.639
THAT THERE WERE ONLY SIX THEY

02:22:27.705 --> 02:22:29.741
DID AND IT WAS THE SIX THAT

02:22:29.807 --> 02:22:31.042
WE'RE DEVELOPING SHELTERS ARE

02:22:31.109 --> 02:22:32.543
WE'RE GETTING DIRECT FUNDING

02:22:32.610 --> 02:22:35.647
YELL SANTA ANA ANAHEIM AND

02:22:35.713 --> 02:22:36.948
CENTURY IN THE COMMUNITY AND

02:22:37.015 --> 02:22:38.883
THE THE ALLERGEN ALSO HAD TO

02:22:38.950 --> 02:22:40.251
DO THAT AND THAT IS NOT AN

02:22:40.318 --> 02:22:43.454
EASY AS AN ELECTED LEADER OF

02:22:43.521 --> 02:22:45.290
A LOCAL BODY TO SAY WE HAVE A

02:22:45.356 --> 02:22:46.791
SHELTERS CRISIS AND THERE WERE

02:22:46.858 --> 02:22:48.826
SOME CITIES IN ORANGE COUNTY

02:22:48.893 --> 02:22:50.728
THAT DELIBERATELY CHOSE NOT TO

02:22:50.795 --> 02:22:52.563
DO THAT FOR WHATEVER THE REASON

02:22:52.630 --> 02:22:54.299
SO NOW TO THEN COME BACK AND

02:22:54.365 --> 02:22:56.034
SAY WELL SEE WE DON'T GET THAT

02:22:56.100 --> 02:22:58.069
THEY'RE THERE IT'S IT'S IT'S

02:22:58.136 --> 02:22:59.570
YOU KNOW SOME PEOPLE HAVE LET

02:22:59.637 --> 02:23:00.939
IT AND SOME PEOPLE ARE THERE

02:23:01.005 --> 02:23:01.973
IN THE MIDDLE AND SOME PEOPLE

02:23:02.040 --> 02:23:03.274
ARE KIND OF COMING INTO THE

02:23:03.341 --> 02:23:05.443
GAME WE WANT EVERYBODY TO BE

02:23:05.510 --> 02:23:07.679
SUCCESSFUL I DO BECAUSE I DON'T

02:23:07.745 --> 02:23:08.913
WANT TO SEE PEOPLE DUMPING

02:23:08.980 --> 02:23:10.281
AND I'VE SEEN THAT TOO MUCH

02:23:10.348 --> 02:23:11.149
SO WE'RE GOING TO GO AHEAD

02:23:11.215 --> 02:23:12.617
AND MOVE TO OUR LAST PANELS

02:23:12.684 --> 02:23:13.885
AND THEN OPEN UP FOR PUBLIC

02:23:13.952 --> 02:23:16.387

OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY

02:23:24.495 --> 02:23:26.464
COMMISSION AND HE ACTUALLY DID

02:23:26.531 --> 02:23:28.967

BE HERE AS YOU MENTIONED I'M

02:23:40.111 --> 02:23:41.679
THE DIRECTOR OF THE COMMISSION

02:23:41.746 --> 02:23:43.181
VERY BRIEFLY WERE AND A STATE

02:23:43.247 --> 02:23:44.682
AGENCY ONE OVERSIGHT BODY ON

MENTAL HEALTH I APPRECIATE THE

02:23:46.050 --> 02:23:47.719

02:23:47.785 --> 02:23:49.120
ASSEMBLY ACCOUNTABILITY AND

02:23:49.187 --> 02:23:50.321
IF EVER YOU COMMITTEE YOU

02:23:50.388 --> 02:23:53.024
FOR THAT I I THINK THE THE

02:23:53.091 --> 02:23:55.093
CONVERSATION YOU HAD TODAY

02:23:55.159 --> 02:23:56.928
REALLY TOUCHES ON MANY OF THESE

02:23:56.995 --> 02:23:58.629
KEY POINTS I LOVE THE COMMENT

02:23:58.696 --> 02:23:59.731
ABOUT LEADERSHIP A PLAN IN

02:23:59.797 --> 02:24:02.133
THE RESOURCES AND SUPPORT WHAT

02:24:02.200 --> 02:24:04.135
WE FIND WORK LOOKING AROUND

02:24:04.202 --> 02:24:06.204
THE STATE IS THAT THERE ARE

02:24:06.270 --> 02:24:09.540
STRATEGIES AROUND CALIFORNIA ON

02:24:09.607 --> 02:24:12.343
THAT TOUCH UPON IS THE ISSUES

02:24:12.410 --> 02:24:14.312
THAT YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT TODAY

02:24:14.379 --> 02:24:15.880
AROUND HOUSING AND HOUSING

02:24:15.947 --> 02:24:18.149
STOCK AROUND THE ECONOMIC

02:24:18.216 --> 02:24:19.384
DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR

02:24:19.450 --> 02:24:21.886
INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES AROUND

02:24:21.953 --> 02:24:24.789
MAXIMIZING ACCESS TO BENEFITS

02:24:24.856 --> 02:24:25.857
THAT ARE ALREADY AVAILABLE

02:24:25.923 --> 02:24:27.792
BE THAT A STATE OR FEDERAL

02:24:27.859 --> 02:24:30.862
BENEFITS IN TERMS OF THE ARRAY

02:24:30.928 --> 02:24:32.764
OF SERVICES THAT ARE NECESSARY

02:24:32.830 --> 02:24:34.866
IN ORDER TO SUPPORT INDIVIDUALS

02:24:34.932 --> 02:24:37.769
WHO ARE EITHER HOMELESS AT RISK

02:24:37.835 --> 02:24:40.338
OF HOMELESS OR ON THAT WHAT

02:24:40.405 --> 02:24:41.873
WE MIGHT CALL ON THE PRECIPICE

02:24:41.939 --> 02:24:43.307
PARTICULARLY CHILDREN COMING

02:24:43.374 --> 02:24:44.909
OUT OF THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM

02:24:44.976 --> 02:24:46.144
OR FOLKS WHO WE KNOW WHO ARE

02:24:46.210 --> 02:24:47.345
DISCHARGING FROM OUR CRIMINAL

02:24:47.412 --> 02:24:50.314
JUSTICE SYSTEM I THINK IT FROM

02:24:50.381 --> 02:24:51.516
THE COMMISSION'S PERSPECTIVE

02:24:51.582 --> 02:24:53.684
THE BOTTOM LINE IS WE CANNOT

02:24:53.751 --> 02:24:54.986
FIND OUR WAY OUT OF THIS

02:24:55.053 --> 02:24:58.089
PROBLEM TO A HOMELESS RESPONSE

02:24:58.156 --> 02:25:00.124
STRATEGY WE HAVE TO LOOK

02:25:00.191 --> 02:25:01.793
UPSTREAM WE HAVE TO LOOK AT

02:25:01.859 --> 02:25:03.127
SOME OF THE CORD DRIVER SOME OF

02:25:03.194 --> 02:25:05.296
WHICH YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT TODAY

02:25:05.363 --> 02:25:07.965
BUT I I I DO THINK THAT WHILE

02:25:08.032 --> 02:25:10.435
WE SEE EXAMPLES ACROSS THE

02:25:10.501 --> 02:25:12.603
STATE OF EFFORTS TO MAKE ALL

02:25:12.670 --> 02:25:14.272
OF THESE PIECES FIT TOGETHER AT

02:25:14.338 --> 02:25:16.574
THE BLUE ANGELS MODEL WE DON'T

02:25:16.641 --> 02:25:19.177
SEE THIS AT A AT A SYSTEM LEVEL

02:25:19.243 --> 02:25:21.212
IN ANY PARTICULAR LOCATION IN

02:25:21.279 --> 02:25:22.880
CALIFORNIA OTHER WORDS THERE'S

02:25:22.947 --> 02:25:24.082
NOBODY IS DOING ALL OF THE

02:25:24.148 --> 02:25:25.550
THINGS THAT ARE NECESSARY IN

02:25:25.616 --> 02:25:27.685
ORDER TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN AND

02:25:27.752 --> 02:25:29.220
I WILL AND I WOULD I WOULD ADD

02:25:29.287 --> 02:25:30.555
TO YOUR LIST BECAUSE I THINK

02:25:30.621 --> 02:25:31.923
YOU HAVE A PRETTY COMPREHENSIVE

02:25:31.989 --> 02:25:33.491
LIST AT THE MOMENT AND AND AND

02:25:33.558 --> 02:25:34.559
INTEREST OF TIME RATHER THAN

02:25:34.625 --> 02:25:36.594
REITERATING ALL OF THOSE THINGS

02:25:36.661 --> 02:25:38.196
I WOULD SUGGEST THAT YOU THE

02:25:38.262 --> 02:25:39.464
ONE THING I HAVEN'T HEARD YOU

02:25:39.530 --> 02:25:40.898
TALK ABOUT TODAY AMONG THE

02:25:40.965 --> 02:25:43.201
PANELISTS IS THE OPPORTUNITY

02:25:43.267 --> 02:25:44.936
TO REALLY RECOGNIZE THAT WE'RE

02:25:45.002 --> 02:25:47.238
NOT LEVERAGING ADDITIONAL

02:25:47.305 --> 02:25:49.273
RESOURCES AS EXTENSIVELY AS

02:25:49.340 --> 02:25:51.209
WE COULD THE TICKET EARLY

02:25:51.275 --> 02:25:53.644
FEDERAL ENTITLEMENTS WE HAVE

02:25:53.711 --> 02:25:55.413
TO DO A BETTER JOB MAKING IT

02:25:55.480 --> 02:25:57.782
EASIER FOR THE SYSTEM WE HAVE

02:25:57.849 --> 02:25:59.550
TO WORK IN OTHER WORDS THE

02:25:59.617 --> 02:26:00.918
BLUE ANGELS NEED TO BE ABLE

02:26:00.985 --> 02:26:02.420
TO FLY IN UNISON I'LL BORROW

02:26:02.487 --> 02:26:05.523
THE THE EXAMPLE UNFORTUNATELY

02:26:05.590 --> 02:26:06.891
THE PLANES ARE ALL DIFFERENT

02:26:06.958 --> 02:26:08.359
SIZES DIFFERENT AGES THEY

02:26:08.426 --> 02:26:10.394
FLY DIFFERENT SPEEDS THEY YOU

02:26:10.461 --> 02:26:11.295
KNOW THEY HAVE ALL THESE SORT

02:26:11.362 --> 02:26:12.630
OF CHALLENGES THAT REALLY

02:26:12.697 --> 02:26:14.398
MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR THEM

02:26:14.465 --> 02:26:18.136
TO LINE UP WITH EACH OTHER

02:26:18.202 --> 02:26:20.138
THAT HAS TO DO WITH ALL OF

02:26:20.204 --> 02:26:21.472
THE ASPECTS THAT YOU'VE TALKED

02:26:21.539 --> 02:26:23.641
ABOUT LAND USE PLANNING IT HAS

02:26:23.708 --> 02:26:25.743
TO DO WITH BUILDING AND CITING

02:26:25.810 --> 02:26:27.545
IT HAS TO DO WITH EMPLOYMENT

02:26:27.612 --> 02:26:29.714
DEVELOPMENT EVEN SUPPORTING

02:26:29.780 --> 02:26:31.349
PEOPLE TO GET ENROLLED IN

02:26:31.415 --> 02:26:33.151
MEDICAID MEDICARE HOW PROGRAMS

02:26:33.217 --> 02:26:34.552
AND ENSURING THAT THE DOLLARS

02:26:34.619 --> 02:26:36.487
ARE AVAILABLE WE SEE DRAMATIC

02:26:36.554 --> 02:26:38.322
DISPARITIES IN THE ABILITY

02:26:38.389 --> 02:26:39.790
OF PUBLIC AGENCIES TO DRIVE

02:26:39.857 --> 02:26:41.792
DOWN FEDERAL DOLLARS AND THOSE

02:26:41.859 --> 02:26:44.095
DISPARITIES CAN'T BE EXPLAINED

02:26:44.162 --> 02:26:46.764
AWAY BY PREFERENCES IN TERMS

02:26:46.831 --> 02:26:49.867
OF THINGS LIKE HOW MANY DOLLARS

02:26:49.934 --> 02:26:51.135
LOCAL DOLLARS COUNTIES PUT

02:26:51.202 --> 02:26:53.604
INTO NON REIMBURSABLE PROGRAMS

02:26:53.671 --> 02:26:55.273
LIKE PREVENTION PROGRAMS VERSUS

02:26:55.339 --> 02:26:59.043
PROGRAMS THAT ARE REIMBURSABLE

02:26:59.110 --> 02:27:00.811
IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TODAY

02:27:00.878 --> 02:27:02.547
FOR THE SYSTEM TO WORK AS YOU

02:27:02.613 --> 02:27:06.017
WANT IT TO WORK AND ONE OF THE

02:27:06.083 --> 02:27:07.552
UNDERLYING ISSUES THAT WE HAVE

02:27:07.618 --> 02:27:09.587
TO ADDRESS RELATIVE TO THAT

02:27:09.654 --> 02:27:10.955
IS WE HAVE TO MAKE IT EASIER

02:27:11.022 --> 02:27:12.156
FOR CITIES AND COUNTIES TO

02:27:12.223 --> 02:27:15.493
BE SUCCESSFUL VERY DIFFICULT

02:27:15.560 --> 02:27:17.395
TO FOR A COUNTY TO KNOW WHERE

02:27:17.461 --> 02:27:18.930
TO TURN THE COMMENT WAS MADE

02:27:18.996 --> 02:27:20.464
EARLIER ABOUT LOOKING AT

02:27:20.531 --> 02:27:23.334
PHOENIX OR LOOKING AT A PEOPLE

02:27:23.401 --> 02:27:24.969
OFTEN MENTION HAVEN FOR HOPE

02:27:25.036 --> 02:27:29.173
IN SAN ANTONIO THE WE ACTUALLY

02:27:29.240 --> 02:27:30.808
HAVE A LOT OF OPPORTUNITIES IN

02:27:30.875 --> 02:27:33.377
OUR OWN BACKYARD ORANGE COUNTY

02:27:33.444 --> 02:27:35.479
LOS ANGELES COUNTY SANTA CLARA

02:27:35.546 --> 02:27:37.248
COUNTY ARE EACH USING AND IT

02:27:37.315 --> 02:27:38.649
TO SAY DOLLARS IN THE CASE OF

02:27:38.716 --> 02:27:40.918
ORANGE COUNTY IT'S BE WELL TO

02:27:40.985 --> 02:27:42.453
TRY VERY CREATIVE APPROACHES

02:27:42.520 --> 02:27:44.589
OF END OF IT INTEGRATED CARE

02:27:44.655 --> 02:27:46.057
THAT REDUCE THE LAW THAT LEVEL

02:27:46.123 --> 02:27:48.092
OF BARRIERS THAT PEOPLE FACE

02:27:48.159 --> 02:27:49.193
WHEN THEY'RE TRYING TO ACCESS

02:27:49.260 --> 02:27:51.596
SERVICES IS A VERY INTERESTING

02:27:51.662 --> 02:27:53.731
COMPONENT TO THAT ON FOR

02:27:53.798 --> 02:27:56.100
FOLKS WHO HAVE BENEFITS ON THE

02:27:56.167 --> 02:27:58.102
COMMERCIAL PAYER SIDE NOW WE'RE

02:27:58.169 --> 02:27:59.670
NOT TALKING ABOUT FOLKS WHO ARE

02:27:59.737 --> 02:28:01.706
CAMPING ON YOUR STREETS TODAY

02:28:01.772 --> 02:28:03.875
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT FOLKS WHO

02:28:03.941 --> 02:28:05.610
ARE AT RISK OF EARLY PSYCHOSIS

02:28:05.676 --> 02:28:08.813
FOR EXAMPLE CURRENTLY WE HAVE I

02:28:08.879 --> 02:28:09.580
DON'T KNOW WHAT THE OTHER SIDE

02:28:09.647 --> 02:28:10.481
BECAUSE THIS PROGRAMS ARE IN

02:28:10.548 --> 02:28:11.415
ORANGE COUNTY WE COULD FIGURE

02:28:11.482 --> 02:28:13.651
THAT OUT BUT WE DON'T HAVE A

02:28:13.718 --> 02:28:15.686
SYSTEM IN PLACE STATEWIDE TODAY

02:28:15.753 --> 02:28:17.121
TO SUPPORT THE ABILITY OF OUR

02:28:17.188 --> 02:28:18.756
COMMUNITIES TO BUILD OUT THOSE

02:28:18.823 --> 02:28:20.524
KINDS OF PROGRAMS AND FOR THE

02:28:20.591 --> 02:28:22.026
FOLKS WHO ARE ON YOUR STREETS

02:28:22.093 --> 02:28:23.494
WHO ARE REALLY STRUGGLING WITH

02:28:23.561 --> 02:28:24.862
THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF MENTAL

02:28:24.929 --> 02:28:26.230
HEALTH NEED THOSE OF THE

02:28:26.297 --> 02:28:27.598
PROGRAMS THAT CAN BE MOST COST

02:28:27.665 --> 02:28:30.101
EFFECTIVE WE STARTED SIX MONTHS

02:28:30.167 --> 02:28:31.802
AGO TO BUILD OUT HEALTHCARE

02:28:31.869 --> 02:28:32.503
LEARNING COLLABORATIVE

02:28:32.570 --> 02:28:33.671
HONORABLY PSYCHOSIS WE'RE

02:28:33.738 --> 02:28:35.539
TRYING TO TAKE IT TO SCALE THE

02:28:35.606 --> 02:28:36.874
LEGISLATURE APPROVED TWENTY

02:28:36.941 --> 02:28:38.175
MILLION DOLLARS FOR THAT THE

02:28:38.242 --> 02:28:40.745
GOVERNOR AGREED -- WERE REALLY

02:28:40.811 --> 02:28:42.246
WORKING TO PULL THOSE COUNTIES

02:28:42.313 --> 02:28:44.682
TOGETHER THAT'S ONE PIECE AS

02:28:44.749 --> 02:28:47.018
A SLIVER OF THE CHALLENGE THAT

02:28:47.084 --> 02:28:49.153
YOU HAVE IN IN YOUR COMMUNITIES

02:28:49.220 --> 02:28:51.589
RELATED TO THE DIFFICULT TO

02:28:51.656 --> 02:28:53.791
SERVE HOMELESS POPULATION IN

02:28:53.858 --> 02:28:54.959
IN IN THIS COMMUNITY AND IT'S

02:28:55.026 --> 02:28:57.295
TRUE THROUGHOUT THE STATE

02:28:57.361 --> 02:28:59.563
SIMILARLY ON THE CRIMINAL

02:28:59.630 --> 02:29:01.932
JUSTICE DIVERSION OPPORTUNITY

02:29:01.999 --> 02:29:03.267
I AM I AM STRUCK BY THE

02:29:03.334 --> 02:29:04.969
COMMENTS AROUND FOLKS WHO

02:29:05.036 --> 02:29:07.204
ARE RESISTANT TO SERVICES WE

02:29:07.271 --> 02:29:09.307
NEED TO UNDERSTAND WHY THAT

02:29:09.373 --> 02:29:11.776
RESISTANCE IS THERE SOMETIMES

02:29:11.842 --> 02:29:13.210
IT'S BECAUSE THE LEVEL OF

02:29:13.277 --> 02:29:15.413
PSYCHOSIS THAT SOMEONE HAS IS

02:29:15.479 --> 02:29:17.515
THERE REALLY NOT ENGAGING BUT

02:29:17.581 --> 02:29:19.083
THEY MAY NOT BE AT THAT POINT

02:29:19.150 --> 02:29:20.651
WHERE LAW ENFORCEMENT CAN

02:29:20.718 --> 02:29:22.653
MOVE FORWARD AND INVOLUNTARILY

02:29:22.720 --> 02:29:25.156
COMMIT SOMEONE WE ALSO NEED

02:29:25.222 --> 02:29:27.558
TO UNDERSTAND WHY PEOPLE ARE

02:29:27.625 --> 02:29:29.994
HEAVILY RESISTANT TO ACCESSING

02:29:30.061 --> 02:29:31.862
SERVICES THERE WAS A RECENT

02:29:31.929 --> 02:29:33.097
CONVERSATION IN SACRAMENTO

02:29:33.164 --> 02:29:35.266
COUNTY ABOUT IT A TEMPORARY

02:29:35.333 --> 02:29:37.735
SHELTER PROGRAM AND THERE WAS

02:29:37.802 --> 02:29:40.204
A FUNDAMENTAL MISMATCH BETWEEN

02:29:40.271 --> 02:29:41.505
WHAT PEOPLE NEEDED IN ORDER

02:29:41.572 --> 02:29:42.907
TO STAY IN THAT SHELTON WHAT

02:29:42.973 --> 02:29:44.809
THE SHELTER OFFERED SO PEOPLE

02:29:44.875 --> 02:29:46.310
FELT LIKE THEY WERE BETTER

02:29:46.377 --> 02:29:49.013
OFF CAMPING IN THE WOODS WE

02:29:49.080 --> 02:29:50.915
REALLY NEED TO THINK ABOUT

02:29:50.981 --> 02:29:52.783
HOW CAN WE DESIGN OUR SYSTEMS

02:29:52.850 --> 02:29:55.353
TO BE RESPONSIVE TO WEAR

02:29:55.419 --> 02:29:57.988
LR THE TICKET EARLY PEOPLE

02:29:58.055 --> 02:30:00.257
WHO ARE ON THE PRECIPICE OF

02:30:00.324 --> 02:30:01.959
ENTERING INTO THE POPULATION

02:30:02.026 --> 02:30:03.394
THAT YOU'RE MOSTLY TRYING TO

02:30:03.461 --> 02:30:05.529
ADDRESS INCLUDING THOSE FOLKS

02:30:05.596 --> 02:30:06.330
WHO ARE COMING OUT OF YOUR

02:30:06.397 --> 02:30:08.632
JAILS YOU HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY

02:30:08.699 --> 02:30:09.734
YOU KNOW WHO THEY ARE THERE

02:30:09.800 --> 02:30:11.936
IN YOUR CARE THAT A CHIEF OF

02:30:12.002 --> 02:30:13.037
POLICE AND OTHERS HAVE TALKED

02:30:13.104 --> 02:30:14.004
ABOUT THE CHALLENGES THAT

02:30:14.071 --> 02:30:15.172
ARE BELIEVE IT WAS ACTUALLY

02:30:15.239 --> 02:30:16.374
RICHARD SANCHEZ TALKED ABOUT

02:30:16.440 --> 02:30:17.775
THE CHALLENGES OF USING I MEANT

02:30:17.842 --> 02:30:19.744
TO SAY FUNDS IN YOUR JAIL FOR

02:30:19.810 --> 02:30:22.246
THE RIGHT KINDS OF SERVICES

02:30:22.313 --> 02:30:23.447
PLAY FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE IN A

02:30:23.514 --> 02:30:25.950
PRE ADJUDICATION STATUS RIGHT

02:30:26.016 --> 02:30:28.018
WE WE HAVE LOST THE ABILITY TO

02:30:28.085 --> 02:30:29.553
LEVERAGE SOME OF THE RESOURCES

02:30:29.620 --> 02:30:31.522
TO ADDRESS THOSE FOLKS AND

02:30:31.589 --> 02:30:33.057
WE KNOW THAT THOSE PEOPLE

02:30:33.124 --> 02:30:34.558
PARTICULARLY IF THEY WERE

02:30:34.625 --> 02:30:35.893
HOMELESS BEFORE THEY ENTERED

02:30:35.960 --> 02:30:37.228
YOUR JAIL AT A VERY HIGH

02:30:37.294 --> 02:30:39.797
RISK OF COMING OUT -- CHILD

02:30:39.864 --> 02:30:41.565
WELFARE FAMILIES INVOLVED THE

02:30:41.632 --> 02:30:43.601
CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM AS WELL

02:30:43.667 --> 02:30:45.369
IT IN IN NEW YORK THERE WAS A

02:30:45.436 --> 02:30:47.605
AN EXAMPLE OF A PROGRAM THAT

02:30:47.671 --> 02:30:49.974
WAS REFERRED TO AS A HOMELESS

02:30:50.040 --> 02:30:51.542
PREDICTOR SYSTEM ALMOST AS

02:30:51.609 --> 02:30:52.676
PREDICTORS SYSTEM AND IT WAS

02:30:52.743 --> 02:30:54.245
VERY ACTUALLY VERY SIMPLE THEY

02:30:54.311 --> 02:30:55.946
SIMPLY REQUIRED LANDLORDS TO

02:30:56.013 --> 02:30:57.915
NOTIFY THE CITY OF INNOVATION

02:30:57.982 --> 02:30:59.550
BEFORE IT HAPPENED AND THE

02:30:59.617 --> 02:31:02.720
IDEA WAS TO HELP THAT FAMILY

02:31:02.787 --> 02:31:04.522
WITH THAT DEPOSIT WITH THAT

02:31:04.588 --> 02:31:06.657
TRANSITION BEFORE THEY WERE

02:31:06.724 --> 02:31:09.026
EVICTED IT'S MUCH CHEAPER TO

02:31:09.093 --> 02:31:11.362
KEEP A FAMILY INTACT TRANSITION

02:31:11.429 --> 02:31:12.663
THEM INTO AN ALTERNATE HOUSING

02:31:12.730 --> 02:31:14.565
PROGRAM THAN TO HAVE THAT

02:31:14.632 --> 02:31:16.534
FAMILY GET DISBURSED BECAUSE

02:31:16.600 --> 02:31:18.436
SHELTER DOESN'T ALLOW MOM AND

02:31:18.502 --> 02:31:20.805
DAD AND CHILDREN OR THE PATS

02:31:20.871 --> 02:31:22.706
OR IN PARTICULAR THE CASE A

02:31:22.773 --> 02:31:26.110
MULTI GENERATIONAL FAMILY SO I

02:31:26.177 --> 02:31:29.713
BOTTOM LINE I WOULD SAY THAT WE

02:31:29.780 --> 02:31:32.016
REALLY NEED TO RECOGNIZE THAT

02:31:32.082 --> 02:31:33.317
THE SYSTEM WE'VE DESIGNED IS

02:31:33.384 --> 02:31:34.952
VERY DISTRIBUTED CITIES HAVE A

02:31:35.019 --> 02:31:37.788
ROLE COUNTIES HAVE A ROLE YOUR

02:31:37.855 --> 02:31:39.657
SPECIAL DISTRICTS HAVE A ROLE

02:31:39.723 --> 02:31:40.658
OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAVE A

02:31:40.724 --> 02:31:42.393
ROLE PARTICULARLY FOR CHILDREN

02:31:42.460 --> 02:31:44.061
WHO ARE AT HIGH RISK IN THE

02:31:44.128 --> 02:31:45.362
STATE AND THE FEDS ARE ALSO

02:31:45.429 --> 02:31:48.365
HAVE A ROLE BUT WHAT WE WHAT

02:31:48.432 --> 02:31:50.401
WE'VE DONE FROM THE PERSPECTIVE

02:31:50.468 --> 02:31:53.704
OF THE STATE IS ENCOURAGE THOSE

02:31:53.771 --> 02:31:55.673
INDIVIDUAL LOCAL JURISDICTIONS

02:31:55.739 --> 02:31:57.842
TO FIGURE THIS OUT ON THEIR

OWN WITH A MISHMASH OF LONG

02:32:01.212 --> 02:32:03.380
TERM FUNDS ONE TIME DOLLARS

02:32:03.447 --> 02:32:06.750
GRAND DOLLARS -- AND WE'VE

02:32:06.817 --> 02:32:08.752
MADE IT VERY DIFFICULT FOR

02:32:08.819 --> 02:32:10.387
THEM FOR FOR YOU OFFER LOCAL

02:32:10.454 --> 02:32:13.424
AGENCIES TO IDENTIFY THAT

02:32:13.491 --> 02:32:14.892
THE KEY INVESTMENT THE KEY

02:32:14.959 --> 02:32:16.093
OPPORTUNITIES TO DO THE

02:32:16.160 --> 02:32:18.896
RESEARCH AND ANALYSIS ON THE

02:32:18.963 --> 02:32:20.197
RETURN ON INVESTMENT THAT CAN

02:32:20.264 --> 02:32:21.799
BE AVAILABLE TO THINK ABOUT

02:32:21.866 --> 02:32:24.335
HOW WE CAN MOVE DOLLARS FROM

02:32:24.401 --> 02:32:27.938
REACTIVE HI COSTS LOW VALUE

02:32:28.005 --> 02:32:31.275
TO PREVENTATIVE LOW COST

02:32:31.342 --> 02:32:33.744
HIGH VALUE THAT'S SOMETHING

02:32:33.811 --> 02:32:35.479
THAT IS UNLIKELY TO HAPPEN

02:32:35.546 --> 02:32:38.282
ACROSS FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES

02:32:38.349 --> 02:32:39.884
THOUSANDS OF CITIES AND SPECIAL

02:32:39.950 --> 02:32:42.253
DISTRICTS AND SCHOOLS WE DO

02:32:42.319 --> 02:32:43.854
HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY AT THE

02:32:43.921 --> 02:32:45.823
STATE LEVEL TO SUPPORT THE

02:32:45.890 --> 02:32:48.025
ABILITY OF OUR LOCAL AGENCIES

02:32:48.092 --> 02:32:50.227
TO RETAIN THEIR NEED TO TAILOR

02:32:50.294 --> 02:32:51.862
THEIR STRATEGY TO THEIR UNIQUE

02:32:51.929 --> 02:32:53.664
SITUATIONS WHETHER IT'S YOUR

SERVICE MAX WELL ALSO CARVING

02:32:59.637 --> 02:33:02.039
THE PATH FORWARD IN TERMS OF

02:33:02.106 --> 02:33:05.409
AGAIN LEADERSHIP THE PLAN IN

02:33:05.476 --> 02:33:07.978
THE RESOURCE BASE WE WE HAVE

02:33:08.045 --> 02:33:09.847
WE'VE BEGUN TO DO THIS AGAIN

02:33:09.914 --> 02:33:11.749
I USED EARLY PSYCHOSIS EXAMPLE

02:33:11.815 --> 02:33:13.050
THE COMMISSION IS SUPPORTING

02:33:13.117 --> 02:33:15.219
COUNTIES IN THINKING IT REALLY

02:33:15.286 --> 02:33:16.720
UNDERSTANDING CRIMINAL JUSTICE

02:33:16.787 --> 02:33:18.756
DIVERSION HOW DO WE MOVE FOLKS

02:33:18.822 --> 02:33:20.457
UPSTREAM RESEARCH FROM THE

02:33:20.524 --> 02:33:21.692
DEPARTMENT OF STATE HOSPITALS

02:33:21.759 --> 02:33:23.060
HAS FOUND THAT FORTY SIX

02:33:23.127 --> 02:33:24.528
PERCENT OF PEOPLE COMING INTO

02:33:24.595 --> 02:33:26.697
THEIR STATE HOSPITAL SYSTEM

02:33:26.764 --> 02:33:28.732
WITH A FELONY CHARGE AND VERY

02:33:28.799 --> 02:33:30.100
SERIOUSLY ILL BECAUSE THEY'VE

02:33:30.167 --> 02:33:31.302
BEEN DEEMED COMPETENT TO STAND

02:33:31.368 --> 02:33:32.803
TRIAL FORTY SIX PERCENT HAD

02:33:32.870 --> 02:33:34.204
NO COMMUNITY SERVICES SIX

02:33:34.271 --> 02:33:35.172
MONTHS PRIOR TO THE FELONY

02:33:35.239 --> 02:33:37.041
ARREST THEY'RE FALLING THROUGH

02:33:37.107 --> 02:33:38.576
THE CRACKS WERE WORKING TO

02:33:38.642 --> 02:33:40.311
SUPPORT COUNTIES TO DO THE

02:33:40.377 --> 02:33:41.679
DATA ANALYTICS THAT THEY NEED

02:33:41.745 --> 02:33:43.681
TO DO TO UNDERSTAND WHY THOSE

02:33:43.747 --> 02:33:44.882
CRACKS ARE THERE AND HOW THEY

02:33:44.949 --> 02:33:46.050
CAN STOP THOSE PEOPLE FALLING

02:33:46.116 --> 02:33:48.419
THROUGH THE CRACKS SIMILARLY

02:33:48.485 --> 02:33:50.588
WERE USING IMAGES A INNOVATION

02:33:50.654 --> 02:33:52.189
FUNDS TO SUPPORT STRATEGIES

02:33:52.256 --> 02:33:53.591
LIKE USING PSYCHIATRIC ADVANCE

02:33:53.657 --> 02:33:55.793
DIRECTIVES TO PREVENT THE NEED

02:33:55.859 --> 02:33:56.827
TO CALL LAW ENFORCEMENT IN

02:33:56.894 --> 02:33:59.430
THE FIRST PLACE TO SLOW DOWN

02:33:59.496 --> 02:34:01.465
REDUCE THE LIKELIHOOD THAT

02:34:01.532 --> 02:34:03.000
THE SERVICE DELIVERY STRATEGY

02:34:03.067 --> 02:34:04.635
THAT COUNTY HAS IN PLACE FALLS

02:34:04.702 --> 02:34:07.605
APART WHEN SOMEONE IS STRESSED

02:34:07.671 --> 02:34:09.340
HOW CAN WE AGAIN LOOK AROUND

02:34:09.406 --> 02:34:11.275
THE CORNER AND ANTICIPATE WHO

02:34:11.342 --> 02:34:13.210
THOSE INDIVIDUALS ARE AND PUT

02:34:13.277 --> 02:34:15.312
A PLAN IN PLACE MUCH LIKE WE

02:34:15.379 --> 02:34:18.148
DO WITH OLDER FOLKS WHO ARE

02:34:18.215 --> 02:34:20.050
MOVING OUT OF THEIR HOMES INTO

02:34:20.117 --> 02:34:21.352
SOME SORT OF AN ASSISTED LIVING

02:34:21.418 --> 02:34:23.253
KIND OF PLAN IS THAT WE TALK

02:34:23.320 --> 02:34:25.089
WITH OUR OLDER RESIDENTS ABOUT

02:34:25.155 --> 02:34:27.458
WHAT COMES NEXT WE OFTEN DON'T

02:34:27.524 --> 02:34:30.327
TALK WITH THE PEOPLE WHO ARE

02:34:30.394 --> 02:34:32.796
IN OUR SYSTEM TODAY AGAIN TELL

02:34:32.863 --> 02:34:34.598
WELL FAIR CRIMINAL JUSTICE

02:34:34.665 --> 02:34:35.833
STATE HOSPITAL OTHER KINDS OF

02:34:35.899 --> 02:34:37.768
PROGRAMS ABOUT LOOKING AROUND

02:34:37.835 --> 02:34:39.903
THE CORNER WHAT WE DO IS WE

02:34:39.970 --> 02:34:41.405
RELEASE WE MOVE THEM FROM ONE

02:34:41.472 --> 02:34:43.407
PROGRAM TO THE NEXT AND WHEN

02:34:43.474 --> 02:34:44.908
AND WHEN THEY ARE NOT ABLE TO

02:34:44.975 --> 02:34:46.610
MAKE THAT TRANSITION AND THE

02:34:46.677 --> 02:34:49.813
SYSTEM FAILS YOU END UP IN

02:34:49.880 --> 02:34:50.848
HAVING THESE VERY DIFFICULT

02:34:50.914 --> 02:34:54.151
CONVERSATIONS ABOUT HIGH COST

02:34:54.218 --> 02:34:57.154
IMPACT VERY REACTIVE CARE AND

02:34:57.221 --> 02:34:59.023
SO I STRONGLY ENCOURAGE THAT

02:34:59.089 --> 02:35:01.425
SELECT COMMITTEE TO THINK ABOUT

02:35:01.492 --> 02:35:03.661
HOW CAN THE STATE HOW CAN OUR

02:35:03.727 --> 02:35:05.729
PARTNERS IN ACADEMIA ON THE

02:35:05.796 --> 02:35:07.965
RESEARCH SIDE HOW CAN WE BEGIN

02:35:08.032 --> 02:35:09.900
TO BRING TOGETHER THE EXPERTISE

02:35:09.967 --> 02:35:11.702
THAT WE HAVE IN CALIFORNIA

02:35:11.769 --> 02:35:13.103

TO TALK ABOUT STRATEGIES TO

02:35:16.607 --> 02:35:17.675
MAKE IT EASIER FOR YOU TO BE

02:35:17.741 --> 02:35:19.910
SUCCESSFUL AND HARDER FOR YOU

02:35:19.977 --> 02:35:21.211
TO FAIL BECAUSE RIGHT NOW IT'S

02:35:21.278 --> 02:35:23.547
VERY EASY TO FAIL AS YOU KNOW

02:35:23.614 --> 02:35:25.683
AND SUCCESS AS THE FOLKS TO MY

02:35:25.749 --> 02:35:27.985

02:35:28.052 --> 02:35:28.886

THE HEARING WHICH IS THAT --

02:35:56.313 --> 02:35:58.782
WE ALL HAVE EXPERIENCES WITH

02:35:58.849 --> 02:36:01.452
SUCCESS AND FAILURE WITHIN

02:36:01.518 --> 02:36:03.821
THE SYSTEM OF HOUSING AND

02:36:03.887 --> 02:36:05.723
HOMELESSNESS AND IT CAN GET

02:36:05.789 --> 02:36:08.759
VERY QUICKLY A MOTIONAL SO

02:36:08.826 --> 02:36:10.360
I APOLOGIZE ASSEMBLYMEMBER

WORKING HARD IN YOUR AREA --

02:36:14.732 --> 02:36:16.300
BUT I I THINK THAT IS FOR ME

02:36:16.366 --> 02:36:18.335
PERSONALLY WHERE I GET REALLY

02:36:18.402 --> 02:36:21.605
-- CAN MOVE FROM MORNING TO

02:36:21.672 --> 02:36:23.807
DO THE BEST THAT I KNOW ON A

02:36:23.874 --> 02:36:26.477
VERY UNEMOTIONAL WAY WHICH IS

02:36:26.543 --> 02:36:28.645
WORKING WITH OUR COMMUNITIES TO

02:36:28.712 --> 02:36:29.880
ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS BUT WHEN

02:36:29.947 --> 02:36:32.082
YOU LOOK AT THE EMOTIONAL PART

02:36:32.149 --> 02:36:33.917
AND YOU SEE HOW MANY FAILURES

02:36:33.984 --> 02:36:35.652
THERE ARE OUT THERE AND THEN

02:36:35.719 --> 02:36:37.321
YOU ATTACH IT TO PEOPLE YOU

02:36:37.387 --> 02:36:39.990
EVEN KNOW IS THEN BECOMES AN

02:36:40.057 --> 02:36:43.227
URGENT KIND OF CRY THAT HOW

02:36:43.293 --> 02:36:45.362
MANY PEOPLE DO WE HAVE TO LOSE

02:36:45.429 --> 02:36:47.631
-- AN ORANGE COUNTY OVER FOUR

02:36:47.698 --> 02:36:49.299
HUNDRED PEOPLE LAST YEAR DIED

02:36:49.366 --> 02:36:51.368
NOW ON THE STREETS OF ORANGE

02:36:51.435 --> 02:36:52.736
COUNTY WE DON'T KNOW THAT THOSE

02:36:52.803 --> 02:36:55.806
WERE ALL BECAUSE OF I'M NOT

02:36:55.873 --> 02:36:58.008
GETTING ATTENTION MAYBE AS WAS

02:36:58.075 --> 02:36:59.510
SAID THEY DECLINED IT BUT FOR

02:36:59.576 --> 02:37:01.044
WHATEVER REASON THOSE NUMBERS

02:37:01.111 --> 02:37:02.312
ARE UP ACROSS THE STATE OF

02:37:02.379 --> 02:37:04.715
CALIFORNIA SO I DO FEEL IT'S A

02:37:04.782 --> 02:37:07.785
MORAL IMPERATIVE THAT NOT ONLY

02:37:07.851 --> 02:37:10.154
DO WE RESPOND BUT I THINK WHAT

02:37:10.220 --> 02:37:11.955
YEAR YOUR LAST REMARK SPENT

02:37:12.022 --> 02:37:14.758
IS LET'S RESPOND EFFECTIVELY

02:37:14.825 --> 02:37:16.493
IN THAT SOMETHING WE CAN ALL

02:37:16.560 --> 02:37:17.995
ANYTHING GAIN FROM THIS SO

02:37:18.061 --> 02:37:19.596
WITH THAT I THINK IF YOU HAVE

02:37:19.663 --> 02:37:22.032
ANY CLOSING REMARKS THAT WAY

02:37:22.099 --> 02:37:23.233
-- WILL BRING PEOPLE UP THAT

02:37:23.300 --> 02:37:24.468
THEY HAVE A PUBLIC COMMENT

02:37:24.535 --> 02:37:25.702
AND THEN WHAT WE DO IS COULD

02:37:25.769 --> 02:37:26.904
PROBABLY KEEP THOSE COMMENTS TO

02:37:26.970 --> 02:37:29.706
ABOUT ONE MINUTE IF YOU -- BUT

02:37:29.773 --> 02:37:32.142
MEMBERS ANY FINAL COMMENTS JUST

02:37:32.209 --> 02:37:33.343
VERY BRIEFLY BECAUSE I KNOW

02:37:33.410 --> 02:37:34.444
WHAT WE'RE RUNNING TRÊN TIME

02:37:34.511 --> 02:37:35.712
BUT THERE IS A NUMBER OF THINGS

02:37:35.779 --> 02:37:37.281
THAT YOU SAID THAT THAT REALLY

02:37:37.347 --> 02:37:38.649

02:37:40.784 --> 02:37:42.052
IMPORTANT ROLE HERE IS TO MAKE

02:37:42.119 --> 02:37:43.720
IT EASIER FOR OUR PARTNERS IN

02:37:43.787 --> 02:37:45.155
THE COUNTY AND THE IN STATE

02:37:45.222 --> 02:37:46.490
GOVERNMENT TO BE SUCCESSFUL SO

02:37:46.557 --> 02:37:48.358
I THINK THERE'S A LOT MORE WORK

02:37:48.425 --> 02:37:50.093
FOR US TO DO ON THAT FRONT AND

02:37:50.160 --> 02:37:51.395

LEVERAGING FEDERAL ENTITLEMENT

02:37:54.164 --> 02:37:55.833

THAT REPRESENTATION HERE SO

02:38:02.072 --> 02:38:03.173
THAT MIGHT BE SOMETHING THAT

02:38:03.240 --> 02:38:04.875

PERCENT I BELIEVE YOU SAID

02:40:47.504 --> 02:40:48.872
WAS MINUTES NINE PERCENT WE

02:40:48.939 --> 02:40:50.207
TAKE OFF THE TABLE THAT THE

02:40:50.273 --> 02:40:51.441
VA COULD HANDLE AND THEN WE

02:40:51.508 --> 02:40:52.609
CAN FOCUS ON THE OTHER EIGHTY

02:40:52.676 --> 02:40:54.244
ONE BUT THAT'S THAT'S A GREAT

02:40:54.311 --> 02:40:56.580
POINT AND THAT'S PROBABLY THE

02:40:56.646 --> 02:40:58.682
BIG REVEAL NOT ONLY FOR MYSELF

02:40:58.749 --> 02:41:00.484
JUST COMING FROM LOCAL TO STATE

02:41:00.550 --> 02:41:02.085
BUT I THINK FOR MANY OF US IS

02:41:02.152 --> 02:41:03.687
UNDERSTANDING THE RESOURCES

02:41:03.754 --> 02:41:04.988
THAT ARE OUT THERE AND HOW

02:41:05.055 --> 02:41:07.557
DO WE ATTAIN THEM AND I THINK

02:41:07.624 --> 02:41:09.760
IT'S AN EDUCATION THAT IS STILL

02:41:09.826 --> 02:41:11.595
A WORK IN PROGRESS I THINK

02:41:11.661 --> 02:41:13.130
WE'RE GOING TO BE BETTER AT IT

02:41:13.196 --> 02:41:14.731
ORANGE COUNTY AS A WHOLE BUT

02:41:14.798 --> 02:41:17.968
ALL TOO OFTEN I WOULD HEAR WILL

02:41:18.035 --> 02:41:19.236
ORANGE COUNTY IS NOT GETTING

02:41:19.302 --> 02:41:21.238
THEIR FAIR SHARE WHICH WAS

02:41:21.304 --> 02:41:22.706
JUST KIND OF A CONSTANT AND

02:41:22.773 --> 02:41:25.275
WE IN FACT LOOKED AND DID SOME

02:41:25.342 --> 02:41:27.778
RESEARCH ON WE CAN'T GET OUR

02:41:27.844 --> 02:41:29.212
FAIR SHARE IF WE DON'T APPLY

02:41:29.279 --> 02:41:30.714
FOR THE FUNDING OR FOR NOT IN

02:41:30.781 --> 02:41:32.949
THE GAME AND SO SOME OF OUR

02:41:33.016 --> 02:41:34.584
RESEARCH SHOWED THAT IN FACT

02:41:34.651 --> 02:41:36.053
WE HAVEN'T BEEN AS AGGRESSIVE

02:41:36.119 --> 02:41:38.422
AS WE COULD BE OR SHOULD BE ON

02:41:38.488 --> 02:41:40.957
MULTIPLE FRONTS OF FUNDING AND

02:41:41.024 --> 02:41:43.627
SO AS THIS LAST YEAR OR SO HAS

02:41:43.693 --> 02:41:45.462
MOVE FORWARD I THINK WE ARE

02:41:45.529 --> 02:41:47.531
STARTING TO SEE GO AFTER THE

02:41:47.597 --> 02:41:49.633
MONEY OUT WE MAY NOT ALWAYS

02:41:49.699 --> 02:41:51.735
WIN BUT WE CAN'T COMPLAIN IF

02:41:51.802 --> 02:41:54.504
WE DIDN'T EVEN APPLY IN THEN

02:41:54.571 --> 02:41:55.872
WE CAN WORK ON THE APPLICATION

02:41:55.939 --> 02:41:57.707
PROCESS AND MAKING IT A LITTLE

02:41:57.774 --> 02:41:59.176
BIT MORE CENTRALIZED AND SO

02:41:59.242 --> 02:42:01.812
FORTH ALL RIGHT SO WITH THAT

02:42:01.878 --> 02:42:02.979

ADDRESS -- TWO THINGS THAT

02:55:46.569 --> 02:55:47.503
IN MY OPINION WE'RE KIND

02:55:47.570 --> 02:55:49.939
OF BY PASS I'M TODAY AT THE

02:55:50.006 --> 02:55:52.275
FIRST BEING WE REALLY FOCUSED

02:55:52.341 --> 02:55:54.977
-- ON THEIR RE ENTRY AT THE

02:55:55.044 --> 02:55:56.545
CRIMINALIZATION AND ALSO MENTAL

02:55:56.612 --> 02:55:58.981
HEALTH WE FORGOT TO FOCUS

02:55:59.048 --> 02:56:01.150
ON A LOT OF JUST ORDINARY

02:56:01.217 --> 02:56:02.118
CONSTITUENTS THAT ARE HERE

02:56:02.184 --> 02:56:05.321
TODAY WE LIVE OFF OF FIXED

02:56:05.388 --> 02:56:08.691
INCOME AND CALIFORNIA UNLIKE

02:56:08.758 --> 02:56:10.459

AND NEW YORK ARE MEDIAN INCOME

02:56:13.129 --> 02:56:14.563
AS MENTIONED VERY BRIEFLY IS

02:56:14.630 --> 02:56:16.299
THIRTY FIFTY PERCENT OF WHAT

02:56:16.365 --> 02:56:18.701
THESE PEOPLE ARE MAKING AND

02:56:18.768 --> 02:56:20.202
STATISTICALLY ONE SAYS MEDIAN

02:56:20.269 --> 02:56:22.204
INCOME SURPASSES THIRTY PERCENT

02:56:22.271 --> 02:56:24.707

I THINK WE CAN IT GREATLY --

02:56:28.844 --> 02:56:30.279
ADDRESSED THIS ISSUE BY PASSING

02:56:30.346 --> 02:56:31.480
THE LEGISLATION REGARDING

02:56:31.547 --> 02:56:33.382
MEDIAN INCOME AND THAT IS

02:56:33.449 --> 02:56:34.984
GOING TO REALLY HELP PREVENT

02:56:35.051 --> 02:56:36.752
HOMELESSNESS FROM THE SIDE OF

02:56:36.819 --> 02:56:38.454
ORDINARY CONSTITUENTS -- WHO

02:56:38.521 --> 02:56:40.556
ARE ON FIXED INCOME SECONDLY

02:56:40.623 --> 02:56:42.391
THING I WANTED TO ADDRESS --

02:56:42.458 --> 02:56:45.027
IS THIS WE STILL HAVE THIS

02:56:45.094 --> 02:56:46.295
NEGATIVE CONNOTATION AYE AYE

02:56:46.362 --> 02:56:47.463
AND I KIND OF EVEN SEE IT FROM

02:56:47.530 --> 02:56:48.364
THE QUESTIONS THAT WERE BEING

02:56:48.431 --> 02:56:50.967
ASKED -- HOW DO WE FORCE THESE

02:56:51.033 --> 02:56:52.935
HOMELESS PEOPLE TO GET HELP AND

02:56:53.002 --> 02:56:54.837
WE WE CAN'T FORCE THESE PEOPLE

02:56:54.904 --> 02:56:57.406
TO GET HELP WE HAVE TO THINK

02:56:57.473 --> 02:56:58.975
OF THESE THEY ARE PEOPLE AND

02:56:59.041 --> 02:56:59.775
WE CAN WE CAN WE TREAT THEM

02:56:59.842 --> 02:57:01.077
LIKE SECOND CLASS CITIZENS IT

02:57:01.143 --> 02:57:02.111
WOULD CRIMINALIZE THE HOMELESS

02:57:02.178 --> 02:57:03.646
AND WE NEED TO REALLY FOCUS

02:57:03.713 --> 02:57:04.613
ON THE CONSTITUENTS SITE

02:57:04.680 --> 02:57:06.983
AND A LEGISLATIVE SIDE -- WE

02:57:07.049 --> 02:57:08.117
CAN'T FORCE THESE PEOPLE WE

02:57:08.184 --> 02:57:09.185

02:57:38.481 --> 02:57:41.117
PRIMARY WAYS IN WHICH THE STATE

02:57:41.183 --> 02:57:42.585
CAN HOLD CITIES ACCOUNTABLE

02:57:42.651 --> 02:57:44.520
FOR NOT TAKING SERIOUSLY THE

02:57:44.587 --> 02:57:46.255
ARENA NUMBERS THE BUILDING

02:57:46.322 --> 02:57:48.124
THAT GOES ON IS OFTEN MODERATE

02:57:48.190 --> 02:57:50.059
UPPER INCOME LOW IN VERY

02:57:50.126 --> 02:57:51.427

WOULD HE TAKE ANY QUESTIONS

02:58:02.405 --> 02:58:03.439

03:03:36.205 --> 03:03:38.574
DO WE NOT ONLY BUILD THAT BUILD

03:03:38.640 --> 03:03:42.444
SO THAT FAMILIES CAN AFFORD AND

03:03:42.511 --> 03:03:44.680
WHERE I CAN GET VERY TESTY IS

03:03:44.747 --> 03:03:48.016
WHEN WE HAVE -- SOME ELECTED

03:03:48.083 --> 03:03:49.485
BODIES THAT WILL LOOK AT EVERY

03:03:49.551 --> 03:03:52.354
WAY NOT TO DO WHAT IS PRESENTED

03:03:52.421 --> 03:03:53.789
TO THEM WHETHER IT'S THROUGH

03:03:53.856 --> 03:03:56.358
LITIGATION WHETHER IT'S THROUGH

03:03:56.425 --> 03:03:57.826
IT'S NOT OUR PROBLEM SOMEBODY

03:03:57.893 --> 03:04:00.229
ELSE'S AND THAT BECOMES AN

03:04:00.295 --> 03:04:01.864
ISSUE THAT WE ALL DEAL WITH

03:04:01.930 --> 03:04:03.599
SO -- I'D LIKE TO END ON A

03:04:03.665 --> 03:04:05.934
POSITIVE NOTE I DO SEE OPTIMISM

OUT THERE ARE SO AND -- YOU SAW

03:04:08.103 --> 03:04:10.105
SEVERAL PIECE OF LEGISLATION

03:04:10.172 --> 03:04:13.575
THAT WERE PUT FORWARD --

03:04:13.642 --> 03:04:14.676
SOME OF THOSE HAVE NOT BEEN

03:04:14.743 --> 03:04:17.112
IMPLEMENTED YET AS JANUARY ONE

03:04:17.179 --> 03:04:18.514
WILL BE THE DATE SOME OF THIS

03:04:18.580 --> 03:04:20.549
WILL BEGAN A ONE THING THAT WE

03:04:20.616 --> 03:04:22.518
DID NOT TALK ABOUT AT ALL THAT

03:04:22.584 --> 03:04:24.920
I FELT WAS A BRIGHT SPOT IN THE

03:04:24.987 --> 03:04:29.658
STATE WAS AD USE OR ACCESSORY

03:04:29.725 --> 03:04:31.827
DWELLING UNITS AND THAT TO IS

03:04:31.894 --> 03:04:35.798
USING EXISTING LAND RESIDENTIAL

03:04:35.864 --> 03:04:38.634
HOMES WITHIN A CERTAIN CRITERIA

03:04:38.700 --> 03:04:40.269
THAT THEY MEET TO HAVE SOME

03:04:40.335 --> 03:04:42.538
FLEXIBILITY ON BUILDING NOW

03:04:42.604 --> 03:04:43.772
AS WE SAID EARLIER BECAUSE I'M

03:04:43.839 --> 03:04:45.441
SEEING THE ANAHEIM MAYOR HERE

03:04:45.507 --> 03:04:47.576
IS SOMETIMES ONE THING LEADS TO

03:04:47.643 --> 03:04:50.145
UNDERTAKEN IN CONSEQUENCE WHICH

03:04:50.212 --> 03:04:52.114
COULD BE PARKING ISSUES AND SO

03:04:52.181 --> 03:04:55.818
FORTH BUT IF WE CAN USE -- LAND

03:04:55.884 --> 03:04:59.087

MORE FLEXIBILITY NOW WITH THOSE

03:05:02.925 --> 03:05:04.293
BILLS SO IF YOU'RE REALLY INTO
