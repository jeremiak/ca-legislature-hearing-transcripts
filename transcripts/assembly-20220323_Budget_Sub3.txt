THE T. S. C. INDUSTRY AND THE COMMUNITY LEADERS WHO GOT US WHERE WE ARE TODAY THIS TRULY HAS BEEN A COLLABORATIVE FOR A GROUP EFFORT. DTS C. PLAYS A CRITICAL ROLE IN PROTECTING OUR COMMUNITIES. IN THE GENERATION USE AND DISPOSAL OF TOXIC MATERIALS BUT FOR TOO MANY YEARS THE T. S. C. DID NOT HAVE THE CONFIDENCE OF STAKEHOLDERS. TO BE AN EFFECTIVE REGULATOR. THE ADOPTION OF A POLICY AND FEE REFORM PACKAGE LAST YEAR WAS A SIGNIFICANT TURNING POINT AND I HOPE THAT THIS YEAR'S BCPS MARC A GIANT STEP. TOWARDS A MORE TRANSPARENT ACCOUNTABLE AND EFFECTIVE T. T. S. C. THE BEAT BCPS REPRESENT OVER A 25% INCREASE IN DTS THE STAFFING ACROSS MANY DIFFERENT BRANCHES AND PROGRAMS. WHICH IS AREFLECTION OF HOW THE DEPARTMENT HAS BEEN UNDERSTAFFED AND UNDER RESOURCE FOR MANY YEARS. BUT THESE PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE THE END OF OUR WORK THE SUBCOMMITTEE INTENDS TO CONTINUE ITS OVERSIGHT WORK TO ENSURE THAT THE SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE IN STAFFING RESOURCES RESULT IN TANGIBLE IMPROVEMENTS IN THE DEPARTMENT'S FUNCTIONS. INCLUDING MORE FREQUENT INSPECTIONS MORE TIMELY PERMITTING MORE CLEANUPS AND MORE PRODUCT REVIEWS. THE LET'S BEGIN NOW WITH ISSUE NUMBER ONE DIRECTOR WILLIAMS WERE PLEASED TO HAVE YOU HERE TODAY.

WE VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE COOPERATIVE WORKING RELATIONSHIP THAT WE DEVELOPED WITH THE LEGISLATURE TO PUT THOSE REFORMS IN PLACE. AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING THAT COOPERATION AS WE IMPLEMENT THE REFORMS. ONE OF THE SIGNIFICANT COMPONENTS OF THE FISCAL REFORM PACKAGE WAS THE RESTRUCTURIN AND RESETTING OF THE FEES THAT SUPPORT THE GSES WORK. AS A REMINDER IN THIS IN SUPPORT OF THE REFORM WE COMPLETED AN ANALYSIS OF THE WORKLOAD IN THE DEEP IN THE DEPARTMENTS THREE PRIMARY PROGRAMS. THE ANALYSIS REVEALED AS YOU STATED THAT WE LACKED ADEQUATE RESOURCES TO PROVIDE SERVICES TO MEET OUR MISSION. THE FEE RATES ESTABLISHED IN OUT IN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET PROVIDED FOR THE FIRST TIME SUSTAINABLE REVENUE FOR DGSE WHILE SUPPORTING% INCREASES IN OUR SERVICES. THIS YEAR'S BUDGET WILL BUILD ON THAT FOUNDATION. THAT WAS PROVIDED BY FILLING CRITICAL GAPS IDENTIFIED IN THOSE WORKLOAD ANALYSES. THE ANALYSIS IDENTIFIED A NUMBER OF PRIORITY MANDATES AND ACTIVITIES THAT WERE EITHER UNDERFUNDED FOR ENTIRELY UNFUNDED. THE REFORM PACKAGE SET UP SET FEE RATES TO GENERATE AN ADDITIONAL FIFTY NINE MILLION DOLLARS TO BEGIN TO PAY FOR INCREASED LEVELS OF SERVICE THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA.

THIS AMOUNT WAS BASED ON ANALYSIS DR WILLIAMS MENTIONED- THAT WAS CONDUCTED BY THE DEPARTMENT TO DETERMINE GAPS BETWEEN OUR EXISTING BUDGET AND THE FUNDING LEVELS NECESSARY TO FULFILL OUR MISSION TO PROTECT. CALIFORNIANS AND THE ENVIRONMENT FROM EXPOSURE TO HAZARDOUS CHEMICALS. I'D LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT A FEW OF THESE PROPOSALS AND WHAT WE EXPECT TO ACHIEVE. FIRST WE'VE PROPOSED TO TWELVE POINT NINE MILLION SEVENTY THREE POSITIONS TO SUPPORT THE CLEAN UP IN VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES INITIATIVE WE REFER TO THAT AS THE V. CI. THESE POSITIONS WILL IMPLEMENT THE PROGRAM EFFORTS FUNDED BY THE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS PROVIDED FOR THE INITIATIVE ENSURING WERE ABLE TO DELIVER ON CRITICAL INVESTMENTS TO CLEAN UP CONTAMINATED LAND IN VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES. THIS INCLUDES OVERSIGHT OF CONTRACTS TO CLEAN UP THE TWENTY ONE PRIORITY ORPHAN SITES DR WILLIAMS REFERENCED AND THAT WERE IDENTIFIED TO HAVE A HIGH POTENTIAL TO RELEASE HARMFUL CHEMICALS. THESE RESOURCES WILL ALSO BE USED TO ADMINISTER MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED EQUITABLE COMMUNITY REVITALIZATION GRANTS TO INCENTIVIZE COME. AND INVESTMENT IN ADVANTAGE COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND OVERSEE THE INSTIGATION DISCOVERY AND FOR CLEANUP OF CONTAMINATION CAUSED BY HUNDREDS OF DRY CLEANERS AND VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS. SECOND WE PROPOSED SEVEN POINT TWO MILLION AND THIRTY SEVEN POSITIONS TO FULLY IMPLEMENT THE SAFER CONSUMER PRODUCTS PROGRAM. THE INCREASE WILL ALLOW US TO IMPLEMENT ALL FOUR PHASES OF THE REGULATORY PROCESS AND INCREASE THE NUMBER OF PRODUCTS THAT CAN GO THROUGH THE EVALUATION EVALUATIVE PROCESS AND BRING SAFER ALTERNATIVES TO CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS. WE EXPECT TO IDENTIFY FIVE NEW PRIORITY PRODUCTS AND REACH AT LEAST SEVEN REGULATORY RESPONSES ANNUALLY WITHIN A COUPLE OF YEARS. DRAMATICALLY INCREASING THE PACE AT WHICH WERE ABLE TO REDUCE CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS EXPOSURE TO TOXIC CHEMICALS. THIRD WE ARE PROPOSING A NUMBER OF CHANGES TO FORTIFY OUR HAZARDOUS WASTE MANAGEMENT PROGRAM STRENGTHEN OUR ENFORCEMENT EFFORTS AND OVERSEE THE SAFE AND EFFECTIVE MANAGEMENT OF HAZARDOUS WASTES. ARE BUDGET INCLUDES TWO POINT THREE MILLION FOR CRIMINAL ENFORCEMENT AND VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES ONE POINT THREE MILLION TO INCREASE THE FREQUENCY OF TRANSPORTER INSPECTIONS AND TWO POINT NINE MILLION TO SUPPORT THE INCREASED QUALITY OF HAZARDOUS WASTE GENERATOR INSPECTIONS FIRE COOPER PARTNERS. AMONG OTHER OUTCOMES WE EXPECT TO DOUBLE THE NUMBER OF TRANSPORT INSPECTIONS BRING DOZENS OF ADDITIONAL ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS AGAINST TRANSPORTERS AND GENERATORS WHO VIOLATE HAZARDOUS WASTE CONTROL LAWS AND REGULATIONS AND REFER ROUGHLY FIFTY ADDITIONAL CASES ANNUALLY TO PROSECUTION BECAUSE OF THE ADDITIONAL CRIMINAL ENFORCEMENT RESOURCES REQUESTED RESOURCES IS TO INCREASE COMPLIANCE RATES AND DECREASE VIOLATIONS WHICH IN TURN INCREASES PROTECTIONS OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND THE ENVIRONMENT PARTICULARLY IN VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES FOR MANY OF THESE VIOLATIONS OCCUR. FOURTH WE ARE REQUESTING RESOURCES TO FORTIFY OUR OFFICE OF ENVIRONMENTAL EQUITY WITH THE PROPOSAL OF ONE POINT THREE MILLION AND NINE POSITIONS. THIS OFFICE COORDINATOR PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT ACTIVITIES TO ENSURE WE'RE WORKING EFFECTIVELY WITH LOCAL COMMUNITIES THE BUDGET REQUEST REFLECTS OUR COMMITMENT TO ENSURING THAT WE IMPROVE OUR COMMUNICATION AND COORDINATION WITH LOCAL COMMUNITIES ACROSS ALL PROGRAMS AND WITH THESE RESOURCES WE EXPECT TO HOLD MORE THAN THIRTY ADDITIONAL. PUBLIC MEETINGS EACH YEAR AND REACH HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF ADDITIONAL COMMUNITY MEMBERS THROUGH OUR VARIOUS OUTREACH EFFORTS. YES WE ARE PROPOSING A TOTAL OF EIGHTEEN POINT FIVE MILLION FOR EIGHTY FIVE POSITIONS THAT ARE CRITICAL TO SUPPORTING EFFECTIVE IMPLEMENTATION OF CBC I AND THE OTHER REFORM EFFORTS.

AMONG OTHER PROGRAMS THAT ARE CRUCIAL TO SUPPORT THE STAFF AND ACTIVITIES PROPOSED IN OTHER REFORM BCPS. I THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION OF THESE PROPOSALS WERE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU HAVE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH DO WE HAVE ANY COMMENTS FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. ZELLERS A MORNING MISTER CHAIRMAN COMMITTEE MEMBERS FRANK MENACE WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE I'M AS YOU RECALL LAST YEAR'S BUDGET INCLUDED A PHYSICAL IN GOVERNANCE I'M REFORM PACKAGE FOR DTS THEME THIS INCLUDED RESTRUCTURING THE FEES THAT SUPPORTED APARTMENTS TWO MAJOR SPECIAL FUNDS AND ESTABLISHING THE BOARD OF ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT. BEGINNING IN TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE AM THE ADDITIONAL REVENUES FROM THE PHYSICAL FORM WOULD SOLVE THE STRUCTURAL DEFICITS IN THE DEPARTMENTS TO MAKE YOUR SPECIAL FUNDS. AND WITH SUPPORT PROGRAMMATIC EXPANSIONS IN HIGH PRIORITY AREAS. THE REFORM IMPLEMENTATION BCPS BEING HEARD TODAY WHICH THERE IS A TABLE OF AN AND YOUR AGENDA. ARE REQUESTING THE AUTHORITY TO SPEND THE ADDITIONAL REVENUES ABOVE THE STRUCTURAL DEFICIT TO SUPPORT THE PROGRAMMATIC GINS. I'M BRING LAST YEAR'S BUDGET NEGOTIATIONS THE DEPARTMENT PROVIDED THE LEGISLATURE WITHIN EXPENDITURE EXPENDITURE PLAN. ON THE PROGRAMMATIC EXPANSIONS IT WOULD PROPOSE IN TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE. OVERALL WE FIND THAT THE PACKAGE OF REFORM IMPROVEMENT IMPLANTATION PCPS ALIGNED WITH THE EXPENDITURE PLAN PROVIDED LAST YEAR. ACCORDINGLY WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE APPROVED THESE BCPS LEGISLATURE USE- FUTURE BUDGET HEARINGS TO CONDUCT OVERSIGHT OF HOW THE- DEPARTMENT IS IMPLEMENTING THE PROGRAMMATIC EXPANSIONS TO ENSURE THAT PTSD IS MEETING ITS MISSION AND ACHIEVING ITS LEGISLATIVE GOALS BUDGET PACKAGE INCLUDED TOLD A FIVE HUNDRED MILLION FROM THE GENERAL FUND OVER THREE YEARS TO SUPPORT- BROWNFIELD CLEANUPS. THIS FUNDING LARGELY SUPPORTS THEY CLEAN UPS- AND INVESTIGATIONS AND A NEW LOCAL GRANT PROGRAM THAT SUPPORTS- LOCAL INVESTIGATIONS CLEAN UPS AND COMMUNITY WIDE ASSESSMENTS. THE GOVERNOR'S- REFORM IMPLEMENTATION BCPS INCLUDE ONGOING FUNDING TO HIRE THE STAFF NEEDED ADMINISTERED ACTIVITY SUPPORTED BY THE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION. THIS IS ABOUT- SEVENTY FOUR POSITIONS AND THIRTY NINE MILLION OR THIRTEEN MILLION IN THE BUDGET YEAR- WE KNOW NINE ALEX IS THAT WHILE THE WORKLOAD FOR THE PROPOSED STAFFING LEVELS IT'S CLEAR IN THE NEAR TERM. THE NEED FOR THESE POSITIONS WILL DIMINISH IN FUTURE YEARS AS A DEPARTMENT COMPLETES PROJECTS SUPPORTED BY THE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION- THAT'S WHY I RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE REVISIT DEPARTMENT STAFFING LEVELS- IN FUTURE YEARS TO EVALUATE. WHETHER THAT PROVES LEVEL THE POSITIONS ARE STILL NEEDED THE TRACK OUTCOMES OF THE BROWNFIELDS FUNDING- BASED ON THE LEGISLATURE TO ASSESSMENT OF THE OUTCOMES AND WHETHER IT FINDS MERIT IN PROVIDING ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR STATE CLEANUPS AND LOCAL GRANTS. THE LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER SEVERAL OPTIONS IN THE FUTURE- AS THE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION- SO START TO BECOME I'M FULLY EXPENDED. IS INCLUDE PROVIDING ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR SIMILAR ACTIVITIES AND ADJUSTING STAFFING LEVELS ACCORDINGLY. REALLOCATING SOME OF THE- STAFFING THAT'S INCLUDED IN THE IMPLEMENTATION BCPS TO INSTEAD TO BE USED FOR THEY CLEANUPS ARE LOCAL GRANTS THAT IS THE STANDARD CONTINUED BUT DOWNSIZED PROGRAM. ARGUS READER REDIRECTING FUNDING AND STAFF FROM THE BROWNFIELD CLEANUPS- TWO DIFFERENT PRIORITY ACTIVITY DETERMINED BY THE LARGEST. I'M WITH HAVE TO TAKE ANY.

THERE YOU GO. OKAY SO I'LL TALK ABOUT THOSE THE TWENTY ONE OR CONCERNS THAT WE IDENTIFIED WE WENT THROUGH A PROCESS OF- LOOKING AT INDUSTRIES THAT WE KNEW WERE PROBLEMATIC THAT HAD CAUSED PROBLEMS THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND MOST NOTABLY DRY CLEANERS DRY CLEANERS HAVE BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR A LOT A GREAT DEAL OF GROUNDWATER CONTAMINATION SO WE IDENTIFIED A NUMBER OF- DRY CLEANERS SITES THAT WERE FROM SIDES AND THEN. SCREAMED FURTHER BASED ON CONSIDERATIONS LIKE CALLUM VIRUS GREEN SCORES AND WHETHER OR NOT THEY WERE IN AND CAN YOU KNOW VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES AND WHITTLED THAT NUMBER DOWN TO THE TWENTY ONE SITES CLOSE SITES ARE NOW IN DIFFERENT STAGES OF THE PROCESS IN TERMS OF- IN TERMS OF. MOVING FORWARD WITH ADDITIONAL INVESTIGATION- SOME OF THEM ARE CLOSER TO HOME QUOTE UNQUOTE SHOVEL READY AND BEING ABLE TO- INITIATE THE CLEAN UP SO THEY'RE NOT ALL AT THE SAME STAGE THERE AT VARIOUS STAGES WE ARE TRACKING THAT- AND I BELIEVE WE MAY HAVE A STAFF MEMBER ON AVAILABLE TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL WORK AND ADDITIONAL DETAIL ABOUT THAT IF YOU'D LIKE BUT THAT'S THE PROCESS WE USED TO IDENTIFY THOSE SITES. AND AGAIN WE'RE MOVING FOR WITH THEM. THANK YOU COMMENTS ON THAT TOPIC. SEEING NONE- ARE THERE QUESTIONS FROM ANYONE ON THE DYESS. I'M SEE NOT LET ME JUST SAY I WOULD. AM I IN MY LAST FEW MONTHS HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE AND SO- I WILL BE HERE TO PROVIDE THE OF FUTURE OVERSIGHT BUT- I THINK OF THE FUTURE FOR DTS SEE LOOKS A- VERY BRIGHT I THINK WE'VE LEFT YOU WITH WE WILL BE LEAVING YOU WITH- SUFFICIENT RESOURCES TO CARRY OUT YOUR MISSION.

IN THE UP MAKING FOR A- SAY FOR LACK LESS TOXIC. FUTURE FOR CALIFORNIANS. IF I MAY UM JUST REITERATE OUR APPRECIATE- OUR APPRECIATION WE KNOW IT WAS A VERY LONG PROCESS TO GET THIS DO YOU KNOW TO. TO GET THIS REFORM AND YOU REMAIN FOCUSED ON IT AND CONTINUE TO BRING THAT AWARENESS TO THE CHALLENGES THE IMPORTANCE OF THE DEPARTMENT AND THE CHALLENGES WE FACED. YOU MENTIONED ASSEMBLYMEMBER GARCIA WHO PLAYED A PIVOTAL ROLE. AND WE I JUST WANT TO SAY WE SHARE YOUR OPTIMISM. WE ARE LOOKING AT HOW FAR WE'VE COME IT WHETHER THAT'S IN OUR PERMITTING PROGRAM IT'S MAKING PERMIT DECISIONS AND I'M SO MUCH SO MUCH MORE TIMELY FASHION IT USED TO WHICH- OR ARE TAKING MORE CONSISTENT ENFORCEMENT POSTURES- ACROSS THE BOARD I MEAN I'M PROUD OF THIS DEPARTMENT AND- I. I'M REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO NUMBER OF PEOPLE HAVING THE OPPORTUNITY LOOKING TRACK OUR PROGRESS AND SEE SEE WHAT WE'RE ABLE TO. PUSH THANK YOU FOR A FOR A AND OF COURSE WE VAMP LONG ENOUGH THAT- ASSEMBLY MEMBER BENNETT WAS ABLE TO COME UP WITH A QUESTION. MY AND MY APOLOGIES I CAME IN LATE TO THIS MAY HAVE BEEN ADDRESSED IN IN THE PRESENTATION AND- JUST JUST TWO QUICK QUESTIONS. ONE YOU'RE YOU'RE ASKING FOR- A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR BROWNFIELD CLEANUP- AND- YOU'RE ASKING FOR PERMANENT STAFFING. BUT YOU'RE ASKING FOR ONE TIME FUNDING A DO YOU HAVE A GAME PLAN FOR FUNDING THAT STAFFING- AFTER THE ONE TIME FUNDING- RUNS OUT. FRENCH COULD YOU WANT TO SPEAK TO THAT. SURE ABSOLUTELY- ALTHOUGH THE FUNDING CONTAINED IN S. B. ONE FIFTY EIGHT IS TEMPORARY AND- AND I JUST WANTED TO. POINT OUT THAT THAT D. IT'S FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS OF FUNDING- THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS WAS APPROPRIATED IN FISCAL YEAR TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE AND ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR IF I GOT THAT RIGHT- ALTHOUGH THE THIS FUNDING IS TEMPORARY THERE WILL CONTINUE TO BE A NEED TO REMEDIATE CONTAMINATED PROPERTIES ONCE THE FUNDING IS EXHAUSTED WITH FOUR TO WORKING WITH YOU. ON FUTURE POSSIBILITIES WHEN THAT TIME COMES THE ADMINISTRATION WILL EVALUATE THE PROGRAMS FUNDED THROUGH SB ONE FIFTY EIGHT DETERMINE HOW BEST TO CONTINUE TO REMEDIATE CONTAMINATED PROPERTIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE ADD A LITTLE BIT IN AB ONE OF THE CONVERSATIONS WE HAD DURING THE REFORM IS THERE ARE SOMEWHERE BETWEEN A HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND AND TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND. UNMEDIATED UNDERDRESSED- CONTAMINATED SITES AROUND THE STATE SO WE KNOW THE NEED IS LARGE. AND WE- THAT IS ONE REASON WHY THE BOARD WAS CHARGED WITH LOOKING AT THE PRIORITIES FOR OUR CLEAN UP WORK. ON AN ANNUAL BASIS AND SO THE BOARD WILL TAKE AN ACTIVE ROLE IN LOOKING AT THE CLEAN UP PLANS- AND THINKING ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT TO ADDRESS FUNDS IN ORDER TO CONTINUE TO TACKLE THAT- THAT. OBVIOUSLY HUGE NEED QUESTION- AND AGAIN YOU MAY HAVE ADDRESS IF YOU HAVE A 70% VACANCY RATE ASKING FOR MORE POSITIONS. WHAT S THE GAME PLAN IN TERMS OF TRYING TO SOLVE YOUR VACANCY PROBLEM. IT JUST DEFINING THE FINALLY THE PEOPLE ONE AS WELL AND MEREDITH CAN CAN AT HER COMMENTS BUT WE HAVE A STRATEGIC INITIATIVE TO EXPAND AND DIVERSIFY OUR WORKFORCE AND- IT DOES CONSIDER- CURRENT VACANCIES AND ANTICIPATED RETIREMENTS WE BEGAN RAMPING UP OUR HIRING LAST FALL AND NOW WE ARE AVERAGING MORE THAN THIRTY FIVE HIRES A MONTH ACROSS THE DEPARTMENT COMPARED TO. FIFTEEN HIRES A MONTH- PRIOR TO THIS INITIATIVE- APPROXIMATELY 70% OF THOSE HIRES ARE COMING FROM OUTSIDE OF DGSE WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO REDUCE OUR VACANCY RATE- WE ARE CONDUCTING WE CONDUCTED- A FEW HIRING FAIRS AS WELL AS INCREASED OUR OUTREACH AND PARTNERSHIPS WITH ORGANIZATIONS AND ORGANIZATIONS AND EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS. THE NEEDS OUTRAGE EFFORTS ARE HAVING AN IMPACT IT'S INCREASING THE QUALITY AND QUANTITY OF OUR CANDIDATE POOLS AND- STARTING TO CHIP AWAY AT A VACANCY RATE- RIGHT NOW WE'RE AT A 13% WE REDUCED IT FROM 15% SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE FISCAL YEAR AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO PRODUCE THAT THEY CAN SEE RATE WITH THIS INITIATIVE. GOOD THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND GOOD LUCK WITH THAT AND I SURE- CHAIRMAN BLOOMS- COMMENTS THAT THE FUTURE CAN BE BRIGHT NOW WITH TWO OF ITS PROPER FUNDING AND I'VE WHAT I HOPE WE CAN DO IS INFUSE A REAL SENSE OF MISSION AND THE PEOPLE OF THAT WORK FOR THE DEPARTMENT IT'S SOMETHING PEOPLE CAN REALLY BE PROUD OF TO WORK FOR THE DEPARTMENT TERMS OF PROTECTING. CALIFORNIANS THANK. I WANT I CAN I CAN READ. AND JUST SAY- IN A STORY THAT WAS DONE A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO OUR STAFF RESPONDED. THAT THE WERE VERY MUCH MOTIVATED BY OUR MISSION THEY'RE VERY- THEY'RE VERY ENGAGED AND FRANCESCA AND I SEE EVERY DAY- THE COMMITMENT TO THE MISSION IS TREMENDOUS AND IT IS. IT'S OUR IT'S OUR IT'S OUR SECRET WEAPON. IN TERMS OF- HOW STRONG THE DEPARTMENT CAN BE. THAT'S GREAT TO HEAR- WILL TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO ESTABLISH A QUORUM. BLOOM HERE SENATE FRIEDMAN MULLIN ANDERSON RIVAS LET. ASSEMBLY MEMBER MULLIN- IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS ON ISSUE NUMBER ONE- NOW WOULD BE A GOOD TIME SO SEEING NONE OF. WE WILL A CLOSE OUT THAT ITEM AND TO MOVE ON TO- QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS ABOUT NON DISCUSSION ITEMS ARE THERE ANY. SEEING NONE ALL ADDICT A. R. COMMENT ON ISSUE THIRTEEN I LIKE TO COMMENT TO REACH CAL RECYCLE THAT GIVEN OUR EXPERIENCE WITH THE BKK LANDFILL WE SHOULD BE LOOKING TO REASSESS THREATS TO OPERATING AND CLOSED LANDFILLS. TO JUDGE WHETHER OUR CURRENT CLOSURE AND POST CLOSURE FINANCIAL ASSURANCES ARE ENOUGH TO PROTECT TAXPAYERS. THIS IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT IN LIGHT OF CLIMATE CHANGE AS THERE ARE A FEW LANDFILLS ON THE COAST THAT MAY BE IMPACTED BY SEA LEVEL RISE AND WHEN CANNELLA. ALMOST VISUALIZE- THE CATASTROPHE OF THAT WOULD HAPPEN IF A LANDFILL WERE TO BECOME A INUNDATED BY- A SEA WATER BUT THAT IS A FUTURE THAT WE HAVE TO CONSIDER UNFORTUNATELY. WE WILL NOW BEGIN WITH PUBLIC COMMENT EVERYONE WILL HAVE AS I MENTIONED EARLIER ONE MINUTE TO SPEAK. WE WILL START WITH THOSE IN THE ROOM AND THEN OPEN THE PHONE LINES. FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE CALLING IN THE NUMBER IS. EIGHT SEVEN SEVEN SIX NINE TWO EIGHT NINE FIVE SEVEN. THE ACCESS CODE. ZERO ZERO. AND DEAL WITH THAT IS THERE ANYBODY IN THE ROOM I KNOW EVERYBODY IS HERE SO I THINK THERE'S NO ONE HERE TO SPEAK ON PUBLIC COMMENT WHO IS IN THE ROOM. OPERATOR ARE YOU OUT THERE AND READY TO CALL ON FOLKS WHO ARE CALLING IN TO GET PUBLIC COMMENT. YES THANK YOU FOR PUBLIC COMMENT YOU MAY PRESS ONE THEN ZERO. AGAIN THAT IS ONE THAT MANY ZERO FOR PUBLIC COMMENT. AND WE DO HAVE ONE PARTICIPANT WE JUST HAVE THE GIVEN THEIR LINE NUMBER ONE MOMENT. AND AGAIN AS A REMINDER.

THANK YOU CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE- I'M JADE TOURNAMENT WITH LEADERSHIP COUNSEL FOR JUSTICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY AND I'M CALLING IN TODAY TO COMMENT ON THE ISSUE NOT PRESENTED BUT RELATED TO THE DEPARTMENT OF PESTICIDE REGULATION- SO WE ALONG WITH SEVERAL ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE AND ENVIRONMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS ARE. REQUESTING AN ADDITIONAL TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR COMMUNITY SUPPORT FUND AT DPRK THAT WOULD PROVIDE DIRECT PROTECTIONS FROM AND PRE PREVENTION MEASURES FOR PESTICIDE DRIFT EXPOSURE AND THE PUBLIC HEALTH IMPACTS. EVEN AS THE STATE MOVES TOWARD SUSTAINABLE AND ECOLOGICAL PEST MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THE HARM CAUSED BY HAZARDOUS AND TOXIC PESTICIDES LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES OF COLOR PRIMARILY LOT NEXT CONTINUE TO DISPROPORTIONATELY BURDENED BY STATUS QUO PESTICIDE USE. WE BELIEVE THAT A COMMUNITY SUPPORT FUND THAT'S PROTECTION SUCH AS INDOOR AIR PURIFIERS BUFFER ZONES AND OTHER STRATEGIES THAT REDUCE EXPOSURE AND PROTECT PUBLIC HEALTH- ARE CRUCIAL THAT WE ENVISION THE FUND TO BE DETERMINED BY A CLEAR COMMUNITY DRIVEN PROCESS LED BY RESIDENTS IN AREAS OF THE STATE MOST IMPACTED BY HARMFUL PESTICIDES. SUPPORT FROM COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS THAT FOCUS ON PUBLIC HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATURE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND THE DEPARTMENT TO INCLUDE A DESCRIPTION CHAU ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT IN THE MAY REVISION.
