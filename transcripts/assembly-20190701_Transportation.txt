HERE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE SO. WE'LL TAKE A LITTLE BIT OF A BREAK. YOUR HONOR ROLL [inaudible] LAKE HERE [inaudible] HIGH QUALITY. I CALL THEM WHICH PORTANTINO. SB SEVEN PLEASE PROCEED. AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR ATTENDANCE [inaudible] GOOD AFTERNOON. THANK YOU I MISS CHAIR MEMBERS. ALL THIS YEAR. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS -- TODAY I'M PRESENTING SB. SEVEN WHICH PROHIBITS CALTRANS FROM CONSTRUCTING A FREEWAY TUNNEL SERVERS FREEWAY. OR EXPRESSWAY FOR THE SEVEN TEN BETWEEN THE I TEN HEN TO TEN RESPECTFULLY -- IN NOVEMBER OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN CALTRANS RELEASED THE FINAL E. I. R. E. I. S. FOR THE SEVEN TEN NORTH PROJECT. THE FINALLY I ARE IDENTIFIES THE TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM MANAGEMENT TRANSPORTATION DEMAND MANAGEMENT SOMETIMES CALLED THE T. S. M. TDM. AS THE PREFERRED ALTERNATIVE AND EFFECTIVELY KILLS THE SEVEN TEN PROJECT -- BACK IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN WHEN I SAT DOWN WITH THE ADMINISTRATION -- THE IDEA WAS TO ALLOW CALTRAIN TO GO THROUGH THE PROCESS. CERTIFY THE I. R. -- METRO -- PICKED THE PREFERRED ALTERNATIVE OTHER THAN THE TUNNEL AND AT THAT TIME IT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE. TO DO A BILL -- AND THAT WAS THE PLAN AGREED TO BACK THEN AND I'M FOLLOWING THROUGH ON THAT -- PLAN SB SEVEN ALSO -- IMPORTANTLY REQUIRE SURPLUS NONRESIDENTIAL PROPERTIES IN THE SEVEN TEN TO BE OFFERED TO THE NON PROFITS -- AND THE CITIES AT THE CURRENT USE VALUE INSTEAD OF THE FAIR MARKET VALUE THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE THERE'S A NUMBER OF VERY SIGNIFICANT NONPROFITS INCLUDING MY NONPROFIT OF THE YEAR -- ARLINGTON GARDEN WHO'S HERE WE'RE GONNA HEAR FROM THEM IN A LITTLE WHILE IN A TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN CALTRANS BEGAN SELLING RESIDENTIAL PROPERTIES AND PLANS TO BEGIN SELLING. THE NONRESIDENTIAL PROPERTIES NEXT YEAR. THESE NON RESIDENTIAL PROPERTIES ARE HOME TO SIX NON PROFITS SB SEVEN WILL HELP THESE NONPROFITS PURCHASE THEIR PROPERTIES -- THEY ARE RENTING -- AT AN AFFORDABLE PRICE. FOR EXAMPLE SCHOOLS WILL BE ABLE TO PURCHASE THEIR SCHOOLS BASED ON THE VALUE OF A SCHOOL PROPERTY. NOT THEIR RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY THE GARDEN WILL BE ABLE TO PURCHASE ITS PROPERTY BASED ON THE VALUE OF A BOTANICAL GARDEN NOT BASED ON SOME OTHER. USE AND THAT'S VERY SIGNIFICANT SO TELL CALTRANS FINISHES THE DISPENSATION OF THE SEVEN TEN PROPERTIES IT MUST CONTINUE TO CHARGE RENTS WHICH IS ALSO SIGNIFICANT. BECAUSE BACK IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WE FROZE THE RANKS OF THE TENANTS IN THOSE HOMES WHO WERE IN THE AFFORDABLE RENT PROGRAM -- THIS BILL WILL REMOVE THAT SUNSET AND AGAIN ALLOW THOSE TENETS MANY OF WHOM HAVE BEEN IN THOSE PROPERTIES FOR DECADES WHO ARE VERY LOW INCOME TO HAVE THEIR RENTS FROZEN AND HELPED OUT. SO TODAY OBVIOUSLY I'M ASKING YOU -- TO SUPPORT THIS BILL THAT DOES THREE VERY IMPORTANT THINGS IT'S ALSO IN PLACE IF AND WHEN CALTRANS EVER DECIDES TO DEAL WITH THE STUFF IS BUT I'M. STARTING TO LOSE FAITH THAT THAT WILL HAPPEN BY THE END OF THIS LEGISLATIVE SESSION BUT I'M VERY PLEASED TO BE HELPING THE NONPROFITS AND ONCE AND FOR ALL -- DISPENSED WITH THE SEVEN TEN MOVES WITH ME FOR A SECOND. WITH ME TODAY I HAVE MEGAN FROM THE PASADENA RONALD MCDONALD HOUSE WHICH IS ONE OF THOSE SIX TENANTS AND MICHELLE WHO'S FROM ARLINGTON GUARDS [inaudible] SO YEARS. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS MEGAN FOKKER AND ON THE CO CHAIR FOR THE WRONG THE PASADENA ROAMING DONALD HAS BOARD OF TRUSTEES. THANK YOU FOR GIVING US A FEW MOMENTS THIS AFTERNOON TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT WHY SB SEVEN IS SO CRITICALLY IMPORTANT. THE PASADENA RONALD MCDONALD HOUSE PROVIDES A HOME AWAY FROM HOME FOR FAMILIES IT MUST TRAVEL FAR TO GET NECESSARY MEDICAL CARE FOR THEIR CHILD. BY THE HOME ENVIRONMENT TO KEEP FAMILIES TOGETHER WITH THEIR CHILDREN AT A TIME WHEN CHILDREN NEED THEIR FAMILIES THE MOST. BECAUSE WE OFFER OUR SERVICES FOR FREE OR TO SMALL SLIDING FEE SCALE -- PARENTS CAN STAY BY THE CHILD'S BEDSIDE WITHOUT HAVING TO WORRY ABOUT WHERE THEY'RE GONNA TAKE A SHOWER WHERE THEY'RE GOING TO EAT WHERE THEY CAN SLEEP FOR THE NIGHT. I ALMOST ALWAYS FULL AND WE HAVE A VERY LONG WAITING LIST. FOR ALL RONALD MCDONALD HOUSES ARE LOCATION IS MISSION CRITICAL WE MUST BE LOCATED VERY CLOSE TO OUR PRINCIPAL HALL PARTS HOSPITAL PARTNERS. IN PASADENA WE ARE LOCATED IN CALTRANS OWN PROPERTIES DIRECTLY ACROSS THE STREET FROM HUNTINGTON HOSPITAL AND A SHORT DISTANCE AWAY FROM TRYING AS MEDICAL CENTER. IN THAT CURRENT LOCATION FOR THE LAST FIFTEEN YEARS WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO SERVE OVER TWENTY THREE THOUSAND CHILDREN AND FAMILIES. SB SEVEN WILL HELP KEEP THE PURCHASE PRICE OF THESE PROPERTIES WITHIN REACH WHICH WILL ENABLE US TO RAISE THE COMMUNITY FUNDS NECESSARY TO ACQUIRE THESE PROPERTIES WHEN CALTRANS SELLS THEM. THEY ARE GOING TO SELL THESE PROPERTIES AND IF WE CAN'T RAISE THE PURCHASE PRICE FOR THEM THERE WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO RELOCATE. MOST POSSIBLY OUTSIDE OF PASADENA. SB SEVEN WILL HELP ENSURE THAT WE CAN STAY IN OUR COMMUNITY AND CONTINUE TO HELP THE CHILDREN ONE OF THE MOST VULNERABLE WHEN THERE'S FIGHTING A VERY SERIOUS ILLNESS RECOVERING FROM A SERIOUS INJURY. AND THAT'S WHY TODAY WE'RE ASKING FOR YOUR SUPPORT FOR SB SEVEN THANK YOU. NEXT WITH DECISION A MOVIE REPRESENT PLEASE. HELLO GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS MICHELLE MATTHEWS AND THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF ARLINGTON GARDEN PASADENA. IT QUICKLY LIKE TO TELL YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT MY JOURNEY I WAS BORN IN IRAN AND AND THE DAUGHTER OF THE CHINESE AND VIETNAMESE MOTHER AN AFRICAN AMERICAN FATHER FROM NORTH CAROLINA. I GREW UP GOING BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN HAWTHORNE HOME OF THE AEROSPACE INDUSTRY AND SPACEX. AND MY LA U. S. T. HIGH SCHOOL IN SANTA MONICA WHERE I LEARNED THAT THE QUALITY OF THE LANDSCAPE AND TAX QUALITY OF A LOT OF LIFE AND THAT URBAN TREES ARE CRITICAL TO HEALTHY CITIES. AND MY GARDEN FOUNDERS BUDDY IN CHARLES WHILE WORKING WITH THE LANDSCAPING COMPANY INVOICE SCOUT TROOP. WHO INSTALL THE WATER SAVING DRIVE ARROYO IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT WE LOST BETTY TO HER STRUGGLE WITH CANCER LAST YEAR AND I WAS HONORED TO BE CHOSEN? AS BY HER AS A STEWARD OF OUR GARDEN EXACTLY TWO YEARS AGO TO THIS DAY. ONE OF THE REASONS ARLINGTON IS SO SPECIAL IS THAT IT FEELS GOOD TO BE THERE OUR MISSION IS WE ARE A COMMUNITY BUILT CLIMATE APPROPRIATE HABITAT GARDEN. OFFERING LEARNING INSPIRATION ENJOYMENT FOR ALL. OUR GARDEN WAS GROWN ON AN EMPTY LOT THAT SAT VACANT FOR ALMOST FORTY YEARS IT WAS PURCHASED BY CALTRANS IN ORDERS STORE HEAVY EQUIPMENT DURING THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE SEVEN TEN CAN YOU IMAGINE THAT CALTRANS HAD BUILT A BEAUTIFUL GARDEN INSTEAD OF A FREEWAY. WELL THEY DON'T THEY NOW THEY DON'T HAVE TO BECAUSE WE DID. TODAY ARE TWO AND A HALF ACRE MEDI TRAINING GARDENS ONLY FOURTEEN YEARS OLD. BUT BECAUSE OF DEVOTED COMMUNITY LEADERS WE HAVE OVER FOUR HUNDRED TREES AND THOUSANDS OF VISITORS YEARLY OUR GARDEN DEMONSTRATES PRINCIPLES OF WATER CONSERVATION AND LAND REFORM. IT HAS BEEN SUPPORTED BY INDIVIDUAL TO MAKE DONATIONS MARMALADE SALES IN THE CITY OF PASSAGE. PASADENA AND IS ON A SHOESTRING BUDGET. THE CITY ALREADY KNOWN FOR ITS TREES WE ARE VIBRANT OPEN SPACE USED EVERY DAY BY CHILDREN SCHOOL SENIOR CITIZENS PLANT LOVERS AND WILDLIFE ENTHUSIASTS. WE ARE CHERISHED BY OUR COMMUNITY AND OUR THE HOME MADE RESULT OF LOVE CONVICTION AND DETERMINATION. WE STOP THE FREEWAY AND INSTEAD WE GREW A GARDEN. PLEASE VOTE YES ON SB SEVEN THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU COMMIT A FEW. CENTER SKINNER. SB [inaudible] FORTY FOUR GOOD AFTERNOON. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS. SB. FORTY FOUR SEVEN OUT OF THE TENT CITIES ACROSS THE U. S. THAT HAVE THE LEAST HEALTHY IN THE MOST POLLUTED AIR. ARE HERE IN CALIFORNIA. SO WHILE WE CLEARLY ARE VERY PROUD OF CALIFORNIA'S -- LEADERSHIP WITHIN CLIMATE PROTECTION. WE STILL HAVE A LOT WAYS TO GO. JUST TO MAKE OUR AIR HEALTHY. AND THAT ON HEALTH YEARS WE KNOW. CREATES A LOT OF HEALTH PROBLEMS SUCH AS ASTHMA AND OTHER THINGS I WANT SITE ALL THOSE. TRUCKS AND BUSES SO MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES THAT ARE FUELED WITH TRADITIONAL DIESEL ARE KEY BECAUSE OF THE POOR AIR QUALITY. AND THE PARTICULATE MATTER FROM DIESEL EXHAUST. TO CLEARLY HELLO MY PINE. HAS SERIOUS HEALTH IMPACTS. AS WE KNOW THIS FROM OUR COMMUNITIES THAT ARE NEAR THE PORTS AND YOUR GOODS CORRIDORS LIKE BY -- TEN NINETY ONE I EIGHTY AND OTHERS SO WHAT IS SB FORTY FOUR DO. IT DIRECTS OUR AIR RESOURCES BOARD TO UPDATE THEIR PLANS ON HOW. THEY'RE GOING TO HELP OUR MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES. MEET THE FEDERAL CLEAN AIR STANDARDS. AND CALIFORNIA'S OWN GHG GOALS THAT ARE ALREADY IN STATUTE. AND IT HOW THEIR WHAT STEPS ARE GOING TO TAKE BY TWENTY THIRTY AND THEN BY. TWENTY FIFTY IT ALSO ASKS THEM TO IDENTIFY POLICIES THAT CAN REWARD FLEETS THAT MOVED TO LESS POLLUTING TECHNOLOGY. AND WITH THAT I WOULD LIKE MY WITNESSES. YEAH. THAT MEANS BE BRIEF OKAY GOOD AFTERNOON [inaudible] KAREN MEMBERS. SORRY QUALITIES GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND MEMBERS I MERIT ALEXANDER THE POLICY DIRECTOR CAL START THANK YOU TO SENATOR SKINNER FOR YOUR POLICY LEADERSHIP ON THESE ISSUES. I WILL BE BRIEF -- WE ARE A TECHNOLOGY CONSORTIUM FOUNDED OVER TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO WORKING WITH OVER TWO HUNDRED MEMBERS TODAY TO ACCELERATE THE GROWTH CLEAN TRANSPORTATION -- WE REPRESENT COMPANIES LIKE PER TERRA MOTIVE BE Y. DE CHANGE THAT OF ALL -- COME BACK TO CALIPER COME TO CALIFORNIA BECAUSE OF OUR CAP AND TRADE FUNDED PROGRAMS FOR MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES. SO WE ARE SEEING THE COMMERCIALIZATION IN VARIOUS PHASES OF VARIOUS OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES TODAY. AND AS LONG AS THE STATE'S STAYS THE COURSE WITH ITS CLIMATE COMMITMENTS THESE TRENDS WILL NOT ONLY CONTINUE WE EXPECT BUT INCREASE -- WE JUST WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THAT IT TAKES MANUFACTURES BETWEEN FIVE AND SEVEN YEARS TO BRING A NEW PRODUCT TO MARKET. AND THEY'RE UNLIKELY TO START THIS PROCESS UNLESS THEY CAN LOOK OUT AND SEE A CLEAR PICTURE OF WHERE THE STATE IS HEADED. SO IN CLOSING BUSINESSES ARE MAKING INVESTMENT DECISIONS ON A LONG TERM BASISAND THE STATE NEEDS TO MORE CLOSELY SINK IT'S PLANNING AND APPROPRIATIONS FOR THESE PROGRAMS WITH THOSE INVESTMENT CYCLES. AND THEREFORE CONTINUE TO DROP MORE MANUFACTURERS AND INVESTORS TO THE STATE. FOR THESE REASONS WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON I'M WILL BEAR WITH THE AMERICAN LUNG ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIA -- MRS SENATOR NOTED CALIFORNIA'S HOME TO SEVEN OF THE TEN MOST OZONE POLLUTED CITIES IN THE UNITED STATES SIX OF THE MOST PARTICLE POLLUTED CITIES IN THE UNITED STATES. A MAJOR SOURCE OF THIS POLLUTION IS THE HEAVY DUTY MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY TRUCK SECTOR. AND SO THAT'S WHY WE SEE THIS IS SUCH AN IMPORTANT OPPORTUNITY TO MOVE FORWARD WITH. CLEANING UP THE SECTOR AND MAKING SURE WE'RE MEETING ARE CLEANER AND CLIMATE STANDARDS. IN THE INTEREST OF PUBLIC HEALTH REDUCE REDUCTIONS IN ASTHMA -- ASTHMA ATTACKS CARDIOVASCULAR ILLNESS LUNG CANCERS AND OTHER RESTORING CARDIAC DISEASES WE ARE YOUR SUPPORT FOR US WE FORTY FOUR THANK YOU.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU MEMBERS OF MISTER CHAIR I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK ON THIS BILL IN YOUR COMMITTEE STAFF I REMEMBER LAST YEAR WHEN WE ENDED UP HOLDING THE BILL AND WE SO WE WORK TOGETHER SO I APPRECIATE IT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MEMBERS SB TWO TEN ESTABLISHES A SMOG CHECK REQUIREMENT FOR MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY TRUCKS HERE IN CALIFORNIA. THIS BILL WILL APPLY SIMILAR RESPONSIBILITIES TO TRUCK OPERATORS TO MAINTAIN THEIR EMISSION CONTROLS AS WE ALREADY REQUIRE OF THE CARS THAT WE DRIVE DALY. UNLIKE PERSONAL PASSENGER VEHICLES CURRENT LAW DOES NOT REQUIRE HEAVY DUTY TRUCKS TO HAVE REGULAR SMOG CHECKS TO ENSURE THAT THEIR EMISSION CONTROL SYSTEMS ARE WORKING PROPERLY THROUGHOUT THEIR LIFESPAN. APPROXIMATELY ONE MILLION HEAVY DUTY TRUCKS TRAVEL ACROSS CALIFORNIA ROADS ANNUALLY AND ARE MAJOR CONTRIBUTORS TO THE STATE'S POOR AIR QUALITY. STATEWIDE NEARLY TWELVE MILLION CALIFORNIANS LIVING COMMUNITIES THE FAILED TO MEET FEDERAL CLEAN AIR STANDARDS HEAVY DUTY TRUCKS OPERATING CALIFORNIA ACCOUNT FOR NEARLY 60%. OF HARMFUL OXIDES OF AN OXYGEN KNOCKS. AND 82% OF DIESEL PARTICULATE MATTER PM TWO POINT FIVE A POTENTIALLY CANCER CAUSING AIR CONTAMINANT MEMBERS DIRTY AIR COST CALIFORNIA OVER TWENTY BILLION DOLLARS AND HOSPITALIZATION VISITS TO THE EMERGENCYROOM. AND CHRONIC ILLNESSES EXPOSURE TO THESE HARMFUL CONTAMINANTS IS DIRECTLY ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASED HOSPITALIZATIONS FOR CHRONIC HEART AND LUNG DISEASES AND OTHER SERIOUS HEALTH IMPACTS FOR ELDERLY ADULTS. AND YOUNG CHILDREN THE CONSEQUENCES ARE MUCH WORSE IN CERTAIN REGIONS ACROSS THE STATE LIKE THE INLAND EMPIRE AND THE CENTRAL VALLEY WHICH ARE GREATLY AFFECTED BY LARGE TRUCK TRAFFIC. AND CONGESTED FREEWAYS JUST LAST WEEK WHEN I LANDED IN ONTARIO I LOOK TO SEE WHAT THE WEATHER WAS AND EVEN THOUGH IT LOOKS LIKE IT WAS A CLEAR AND PRETTY DAY. MY PHONE SAID THAT AND THE AIR WAS ON HEALTHY FOR CERTAIN ELEMENTS CERTAIN -- GROUPS. DESPITE THE INVESTMENTS WE HAVE MADE TO SUPPORT A TRANSITION TO ZERO AND NEAR ZERO EMISSION HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES. DIESEL TRUCKS WILL CONTINUE TO OPERATE ON OUR ROADS FOR DECADES TO COME WE'VE TAKEN THE BOLD STEP OF MAKING SURE THAT THEY MAINTAIN THEIR MISSION CONTROLS. THROUGHOUT THEIR LIFESPAN WE HAVE TO TAKE THAT STEP. THIS SECTION ALONE WILL PROVIDE SIGNIFICANT AIR QUALITY AND PUBLIC HEALTH BENEFITS. OVER THE NEXT DAY DECADE SB TWO TEN WILL ASSIST IN THE REMOVAL OF SIXTEEN HUNDRED TONS OF HARMFUL PARTICULAR MATTER WHICH IS THE EQUIVALENT OF TAKING THREE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND TRUCKS. OFF THE ROAD NOT ONLY WILL SB TWO TEN HELP IMPROVE PUBLIC HEALTH AN AIR QUALITY IT WILL ALSO IMPROVE THE LIFE EXPECTANCY. OF HEAVY DUTY TRUCKS AS BECOME MORE FREQUENTLY MAINTAINED. THIS BILL ALSO APPLIES TO OUT OF STATE TRUCKS AND WILL HELP LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD FOR LAW ABIDING CALIFORNIA TRUCK OWNERS AND OPERATORS. SIMPLY PUT SB TWO TEN WILL BE A WIN WIN FOR CALIFORNIA INDUSTRIES AND PUBLIC HEALTH OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS I'VE WORKED DILIGENTLY WITH STAKEHOLDERS. TO ROOF FOR A BALANCED MEASURE THAT ADVANCES CLEAN AIR AND INCORPORATES INDUSTRY INPUT. WITH THE MOST RECENT AMENDMENT SEVERAL ORGANIZATIONS HAVE MOVED TO NEUTRAL INCLUDING THE CALIFORNIA TRUCKING ASSOCIATION ORGANIZATIONS LIKE THE CALIFORNIA TRUCKING ASSOCIATION AND CALIFORNIA FARM BUREAU HAVE BEEN ACTIVELY ENGAGED ON THIS ISSUE OF SHARED IMPORTANCE. AS THEY TO WANT TO STATE TO THE STATE TO FAIRLY ENFORCE VEHICLE STANDARDS AND EMISSION LAWS. I REMAIN COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH INDUSTRY AND CLEAN AIR ADVOCATES IN ORDER TO CREATE A BALANCED AND SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM. THIS INCLUDES WORKING TO ENSURE THAT VEHICLES HAVE A REASONABLE AND COST EFFECTIVE PATH TOWARDS COMPLIANCE INCLUDING LOW USE AND SPECIAL PLATED VEHICLES. WE ARE IN AGREEMENT THAT A COMPLIANCE MECHANISM SHOULD BE A PLACE THAT WILL ENSURE THESE VEHICLES CAN CONTINUE TO BE OPERATED. LAWFULLY AND WITHOUT PENALTY SB TO SET TEN IS SUPPORTED BY DOZENS OF ADMIRE BUYER MENTAL HEALTH AND CLEAN TRANSPORTATION TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY ORGANIZATIONS HERE WITH ME IN SUPPORT TODAY IS MEREDITH ALEXANDER POLICY DIRECTOR FOR CAL START. AND BILL MCGOVERN POLICY DIRECTOR FOR THE COALITION FOR CLEAN AIR. KAREN MEMBERS AND THANK YOU TO SENATOR LEYVA. I'M. I WON'T SAY AGAIN WHAT CAL START AS IN WHAT WE DO BUT ARE TWO HUNDRED MEMBERS INCLUDE NONPROFITS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IN LARGE FLEETS SUCH AS UPS FEDEX AND FRITO LAY. WE ALSO RUN A SUSTAINABLE FLEET CERTIFICATION PROGRAM. SO AS YOU KNOW MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES ARE THE BACKBONE OF OUR FREIGHT SYSTEM WHICH IS A MAJOR PART OF THE STATE'S ECONOMY HOWEVER THEY ALSO EMIT A DISPROPORTIONATE SHARE OF POLLUTANTS AND GHGS -- WE KNOW THAT OUR MEMBERS PROPERLY MAINTAIN THEIR HEAVY DUTY FLEET TO ENSURE THEIR IN COMPLIANCE. HOWEVER SOME FLEETS ARE GROSS POLLUTERS AND THIS CREATES A COMPETITIVE DISADVANTAGE FOR THE FLEETS WHO ARE RESPONSIBLE AND MAINTAIN THEIR EQUIPMENT PROPERLY WELL THE BAD ACTORS ARE ABLE. TO CONTINUE POLLUTING OUR COMMUNITIES AIR. THE CURRENT LACK OF SMOG CHECKS FOR TRUCKS ESSENTIALLY EQUATES TO AN UNFAIR TAX ON RESPONSIBLE BUSINESSES AND AN UNFAIR TAX ON OUR CHILDREN'S LUNGS. SB TWO TEN WILL LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD BY ENSURING THAT EVERYONE IS HELD TO THE SAME STANDARD WHEN IT COMES TO VEHICLE EMISSIONS. THIS BILL WOULD ACTUALLY HELP MANY FLEETS BY STOPPING LOWER AND OPERATORS THAT HAVE POLLUTING VEHICLES FROM UNDER UNDER CUTTING THEIR MORE PROFESSIONAL OPERATIONS. AND THIS BILL IS DONE IN A SENSIBLE WAY IT'S MEANT TO BE A LIGHT TOUCH REGULATORY SYSTEM AND IT SETS OUT A STREAMLINED PROCESS FOR FLEETS THAT HAVE AN ESTABLISHED COMPLIANCE HISTORY. SO WE KNOW THE CARD WOULD DEVELOP THE PROGRAM THROUGH A FULL REAL MAKING INCLUDING A PUBLIC STAKEHOLDER PROCESS WHEN OTHER ISSUES COULD BE -- WORKED OUT IN DETAIL SO IN SUMMARY THE BILL PROVIDES A WORKABLE APPROACH TO TAMPING DOWN ON GROSS POLLUTERS WHILE AVOIDING UNNECESSARY RED TAPE. AND NO FLEET OPERATORS SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO CIRCUMVENT VEHICLES THE STATE'S VEHICLE EMISSION STANDARDS SB TWO TEN WILL ENSURE PARITY ACROSS ALL INDUSTRY STAKEHOLDERS AND THEREFORE WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR AYE VOTE. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS BILL AGAIN WITH COALITION FOR CLEAN AIR SUPPORT AND WE THANK CENTER LEYVA FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD I ALSO WANT TO THANK MR THROWN IN WITH THE COMMITTEE FOR HIS WORK ON THE BILL. I'M QUITE CONFIDENT THAT VIRTUALLY ALL OF YOUR CONSTITUENTS WOULD BE SHOCKED. IF THEY KNEW THAT THERE IS NO SMOG CHECK FOR TRUCKS ALREADY. THERE IS NO COMPREHENSIVE INSPECTION AND MAINTENANCE PROGRAM FOR HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES. THAT'S ANALOGOUS TO WHAT WE HAVE WITH OUR CARS WE KNOW ONCE THEY REACH A CERTAIN AGE WE HAVE TO GO THROUGH A SMOG CHECK. AND THE ADVANTAGE OF THAT OF COURSE IS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE EMISSIONS THAT WE'RE ACTUALLY GETTING ON THE ROAD. ARE WHAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE WHEN THE ENGINE IS CERTIFIED. IT'S ODD THAT WE HAVE THIS SMOG CHECK FOR PASSENGER VEHICLES BUT NOT FOR HEAVY DUTY TRUCKS GIVEN THAT AS YOU'VE HEARD FROM CENTER LEYVA AND FROM SENATOR SKINNER. MOST OF THE MAJOR AIR POLLUTANTS ACTUALLY ARE COMING FROM THE MOVEMENT OF GOODS RATHER THAN THE MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE. AND IT'S ALREADY BEEN FOUND THAT FOR SOME OF THESE TRUCKS THE EMISSIONS ARE ACTUALLY UP TO NINE TIMES ON THE ROAD. WHAT THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO BE WHEN THE ENGINE WAS CERTIFIED AND THE WHOLE POINT OF AN INSPECTION MAINTENANCE PROGRAM IS TO CATCH THAT AND FIX IT AND WE THINK IT WILL BE? A SMALL MINORITY OF THE TRUCKS THAT ARE ON THE ROAD THAT ARE ACTUALLY GENERATING MOST OF THE POLLUTION. HAVING THIS MEASURE IS -- AN IMPORTANT PIECE OF CALIFORNIA'S PLANTS REDUCE AIR POLLUTION IT'S ALREADY IN THE STATE'S OFFICIAL PLAN TO COME INTO ATTAINMENT. WITH CLEAN AIR ACT HEALTH STANDARDS. AND IN FACT THAT PROCESS OF PUTTING THIS IN PLACE IS ALREADY UNDER WAY. THROUGH THE EARLY STAGES OF A REGULATORY PROCEEDING BUT WE THINK PUTTING IN ITS A STATUTE HAVING THE LEGISLATURE INVOLVED IN CRAFTING IT WILL MAKE IT A MORE EFFECTIVE PROGRAM. THANK YOU. MOVE THE BILL. ANY MEMBERS THE PUBLIC THANK STEP UP TO THE MIKE AND WE ZERO SUPPORT THE BILL PLEASE TAKE YOUR NAME THE REPRESENTING. AND ME. TOO JOSIAH YOUNG ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA NATURAL GAS VEHICLES COALITION IN SUPPORT THANK THE AUTHOR FOR THE LAST AMENDMENTS. ALSO A MAP OF THE BIO ENERGY ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE.

ANY OTHER MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC THAT HAVE. ANY SUPPORT FOR THIS BILL. GOING ON TO ANY MEMBERS THE PUBLIC HAVE ANY OPPOSITION HAVE CONCERNS WITH THE BILL PLEASE TAKE [inaudible] COMING UP. WE NEED TO MAKE SOME ROOM FOR THE OPPOSITION AUTHOR SO. WE HAVE ONE MORE [inaudible] GOTCHA. PLEASE TAKE YOUR NAME YOU REPRESENTING PLEASE IN OPPOSITION. AB MARIJUANA CALIFORNIA TRUCKING ASSOCIATION HERE -- WE'VE REMOVED OUR OPPOSITION ON THE BILL WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE AUTHOR -- INNER STAFF FOR ALL THE WORK THAT'S GONE INTO THIS BILL -- OUR PREVIOUS LETTER POINT OUT TO CONCERNS THAT WE HAD RELATING TO THE VIçT ALREADY. AS WELL AS THE FIX FIX A PERIOD FOR THE OUR CULTURAL VEHICLE -- BOTH THOSE HAVE BEEN ADDRESSED -- SPECIFICALLY ON THE P. LANGUAGE THE LATEST SET OF AMENDMENTS I ENSURE THAT THE AUTHORITY REMAINS WITH THE LEGISLATURE -- AND NOT DELEGATE AND NOT RIGHT I DELEGATED TO AIR BE SO -- AND IT YEAH IN ADDITION TO THE FIFTH ALREADY -- THE THREE REPORTS THAT ARE MANDATED TO COME BACK TO LEGISLATURE WE THINK YOU'RE GONNA GO A LONG WAY TO ENSURE THIS THIS -- PROGRAM IS IMPLEMENTED CORRECTLY THANK YOU. NEXT WITNESS PLEASE. NO WELL CREAMERS CALIFORNIA FARM BUREAU FEDERATION WE REALLY APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S WORK ON THIS BILL -- MANY OF OUR CONCERNS HAVE BEEN ADDRESSED HOWEVER WE HAVE A SIGNIFICANT CONCERN. THAT REMAINS TO BE ADDRESSED AND THAT'S AROUND THE ISSUE OF LOW USED VEHICLES AND VEHICLES THAT ARE LICENSED AS SPECIAL EQUIPMENT VEHICLES. SO IN THE LOW USE IN INSTANCE THESE THERE ABOUT EIGHT HUNDRED TRUCKS IN CALIFORNIA. THAT ARE COMPLYING WITH THE DIESEL TRUCK AND BUS RULED BY KEEPING THEIR MILEAGE UNDER A THOUSAND MILES IN RURAL AREAS THERE MAY NOT BE ANY. LOCATIONS WHERE THIS TESTING COULD OCCUR AND THAT WOULD REQUIRE THEM TO PUT ON SIGNIFICANT MILES TO COMPLY WITH THE REQUIREMENTS UNDER SB. TWO TEN AND SO WE NEED TO HAVE A WAY THAT THOSE VEHICLES CAN COMPLY WITHOUT ON THREATENING THEIR COMPLAINTS OPTION UNDER THE DIESEL TRUCK AND BUS. I DO SEE THE SENATOR NODDING HER HEAD. IN THIS PLACE YES THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE JUST AN OLD FIELD ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA CATTLEMEN'S ASSOCIATION -- WITH MY COLLEAGUE FROM FORMER WANT TO THANK THE AUTHORS OFFICE FROM WORKING WITH US ON THIS BILL ADDRESSING -- AT LEAST ONE CONCERN RIGHT NOW WHICH IS THE FIX A TICKET THAT WAS MENTIONED -- INCREASING THE DAYS FROM FORTY FIVE TO SEVENTY FIVE WE WOULD GREATLY APPRECIATE THAT IN ADDITION TO THE OUTSTANDING ISSUE THAT MISS KRAMER'S MENTIONED -- ALSO MAKING SURE THAT ESSIE PLATED VEHICLES LARGELY IMPLEMENTS OF HUSBANDRY WHICH CAN BE ANYTHING FROM A TRAILER TO A FEED TRACK OF COURSE A TRAILER NOT REQUIRING TESTING OF THIS PROGRAM BUT A FEW TRUCKS CERTAINLY. REQUIRING TESTING WANNA MAKE SURE THAT THOSE VEHICLES CAN COMPLY -- IF THERE'S NO MOBILE SOURCE TESTING THAT IS PROVIDED -- WE KNOW THAT THE BILL ALLOWS FOR IT BUT ALLOWING FOR IT AND PROVIDING THAT SERVICE ARE TWO VERY DIFFERENT THINGS -- WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THOSE VEHICLES DON'T OF VIOLATE THEIR REGISTRATION AND LICENSING CONDITIONS WHICH TYPICALLY ARE JUST DRIVING ONE MILE INCIDENTALLY UP AND DOWN THE ROAD BETWEEN FORMS. CERTAINLY WOULD BE ABLE TO COMPLY -- IF THOSE VEHICLES DID NOT HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY. TO MAKE IT TO A TESTING FACILITY SO WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT THOSE SERVICES ARE NOT ONLY AVAILABLE BUT THEY'RE ECONOMICALLY FEASIBLE -- TO ENSURE THAT AGAIN HAVING SERVICES PROVIDED IN LA COUNTY -- MAY MEET THAT THE TEST FOR A OR B. TO OFFER THOSE SERVICES BUT IF THE TRUCK IS LOCATED MODOC COUNTY I DON'T SEE HOW IT'S ECONOMICALLY VIABLE. TO YOU -- TO TO GET THOSE MOBILE TESTING FACILITIES UP THERE SO WITH THAT LOOK FOR WORKING THE AUTHORED APPRECIATE -- OF AFFORDABLE THANK YOU. THANKS. I HAVE MY GROUPS HERE ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA MUNICIPAL UTILITIES ASSOCIATION -- PUBLIC UTILITIES -- PUBLICLY OWNED UTILITIES IN CALIFORNIA -- UNLIKE THE PRIVATE FLEETS THEIR THEIR THEIR HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES ARE ACTUALLY REGULATED BY CARD RIGHT NOW UNDER SOMETHING CALLED THE THE FLEET REGULATION FOR PUBLIC AGENCIES AND PUBLIC UTILITIES AND AND AS WE KNOW WE UNDERSTAND SB TWO TEN IS GOING TO COME AT YOU. YOU SURPLUS AT REGULATION AND WHAT WE WHAT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE IS THAT THERE'S GOING FORWARD THE PUBLICATION SHE'S WERE ALREADY DOING THINGS -- ON AVAILABLE CONTROL TECHNOLOGY THINGS -- AND AND AND INSPECTING THEIR VEHICLES ALREADY KIND OF CONTINUE IN THE SAME MANNER THAT THEY'RE THAT THEY'RE CURRENTLY OPERATING UNDER SO SPECIFICALLY. AN IN PAGE FOR THE ANALYSIS -- POINTS THIS OUT WE'RE WE'RE LOOKING FOR THE ABILITY FOR THESE PUBLIC AGENCIES TO CONTINUE TO BE ABLE TO DO IN THE HOUSE -- TESTING OF THEIR VEHICLES IN THEIR FLEETS -- ON YOU KNOW ON THEIR SITES AS THEY DO NOW UNDER THE UNDER THE LOCAL AGENCY -- RULE THAT THEY'RE COMPLYING WITH AND THAT THAT'S PROBABLY OUR MAIN CONCERN THERE'S A COUPLE OTHER THINGS ABOUT STREAMLINING -- EXISTING RATRI PROGRAMS WITH THE CHP AND SOME LANGUAGE TO ENSURE THAT THAT THE THAT THE IN THE AUTHOR POINTED OUT THAT THE THE INTENT TO HAVE OUT OF STATE -- VEHICLES COME YOU KNOW SHOULD BE CERTIFIED COMPLY WITH THE LAW WE WANTED TO WE WE WOULD APPRECIATE SOME CLARIFICATION AROUND THE FACT THAT THE FEES FOR FOR FOR ARISTIDE VEHICLES. THAT THERE IS SOME LANGUAGE IN THERE SAYING THAT THERE WILL BE FEES FOR OUR OUT OF STATE VEHICLES -- TO ENSURE THAT YOU KNOW CALIFORNIA TAXPAYERS AREN'T SUBSIDIZING THE COMPLIANCE COSTS FOR VEHICLES COMING IN FROM OUT OF STATE SO WE WOULD APPRECIATE SOME LANGUAGE AROUND THAT THANK YOU FOR THAT. NEXT WITNESS PLAYSTATION AMY REPRESENTING. HER FRAZIER NUMBERS SHAUNA GIRL WE HAVE A WESTERN STATES TRUCKING ASSOCIATION REMAIN OPPOSED TO THE BILL THAT'S MOVING UNDER CORRECT IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION THANK OU TO THE AUTHOR. THE BIG ISSUE FOR OUR MEMBERS WHO ARE ALREADY REELING FROM VERY SIGNIFICANT TRUCK AND BUS REGULATION COSTA CARD. THIS IS JUST ANOTHER COST ON TOP OF A COST ON TOP OF COST IF YOU RECALL. TRUCK AND BUS REGULATION REQUIRES MIGRATION TO TWENTY TEN OR NEWER TECHNOLOGY WHICH IS VERY LOW EMISSIONS LEVEL. ADDING THIS COSTLY PROGRAM ALTHOUGH COULD IS THE AUTHOR FOR PUTTING THE COST PROCESS THROUGH THE LEGISLATIVE. PROCESS HOWEVER THE COMPLEXITY PART OF REQUIRING AN OWNER ANNUALLY TO DRIVE TO A FACILITY SIMILAR -- TO JUSTIN'S COMMENTS IT'S VERY NOT WORKABLE CURRENTLY SO LOOK FOR TO WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR TO MAKE IT MORE SMALL TRUCKER FRIENDLY. BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT SMALL BUSINESSES THE BACKBONE IN CONSTRUCTION TRUCKING AND OTHER MEMBERS THAT -- WE REPRESENT THANK YOU THANK YOU NEXT WITH THIS PLEASE TO TRIMMING YOUR REPRESENT. YET JOHN WHEN YOU'RE ON THE OTHER CALIFORNIA FUELS INCONVENIENCE ALLIANCE WE REPRESENT 95%. OF THE FUEL MARKETERS AND CON HERE'S THE WHOLE THE FUEL IN THE STATE -- WOULD ECHO SOME OF THE COMMENTS THAT WERE JUST MADE YEAH WE DO BELIEVE WE DO BELIEVE THE BILL IS MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION AND WE APPRECIATE ALL THE AMENDMENTS HAVE BEEN TAKEN BUT WOULD LIKE TO SEE SOME ADDITIONAL OVERSIGHT ON THE COMPLEXITY ASPECT OF THE PROGRAM. THANKS. THANKS WITH THIS PLEASE YES -- REFERRING CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE REMAIN OPPOSED LESS AMENDED FOR THE REASONS OUTLINED BY MY COLLEAGUES AT THE FARM BUREAU AND CATTLEMEN'S. THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC THEATER IN OPPOSITION TO THE AUTHORS BILL ARE HAVE CONCERNS. SEEING NONE -- QUESTIONS OF THE COMMITTEE MR REASON. THANK YOU CHAIR -- CENTER LIVE AT THANK YOU O MUCH FOR YOUR TREMENDOUS WORK ON THIS AND YOUR WILLINGNESS -- TO GO BACK AND FORTH NEGOTIATE AND COME UP WITH THE BILL THAT YOU HAVE. IT WAS MENTIONED ABOUT -- ESSIE -- PLATED VEHICLES A SPECIAL -- EQUIPMENT VEHICLES AND THE STRUGGLE OF THE CHALLENGE IT IS TO TAKE THEM TO INSPECTION SITES. IT WAS ALSO MENTIONED THAT IN THE BILL IT IS PROMISING THAT ALLOWS FOR MOBILE INSPECTIONS IS THAT IN YOUR YOUR INTENT TO KEEP A PERMISSIVE OR IS IT YOUR INTENT. TO PROVIDE A MOBILE SERVICE FOR INSPECTIONS. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION ABSOLUTELY IT IS -- WE ACTUALLY HAVE A LITTLE OUT LIST OF DIFFERENT WAYS THAT THE VEHICLES CAN BE INSPECTED -- THE MOBILE INSPECTORS ARE DEFINITELY ON ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT ONES. TELEMATICS DONGLES WHICH TRANSFERRED THE TRANSFER THE DATA VIA SL YOUR NETWORK OR STATION BASED WHICH WOULD BE AT THE STATE STATION BASED OR KIOSKS WHERE YOU DRIVE A PLUGIN AND TRANSMIT DATA. SO WE HAVE A WHOLE MENU OF OF THINGS THAT WE COULD DO I THINK CANDIDLY A LOT OF THAT WILL DEPEND ON WHAT THE FEE STRUCTURE IN SEPT BEING. AND HOW MUCH THEY CAN AFFORD TO IMPLEMENT BUT I THINK THE MOST IMPORTANT ONE IS ABSOLUTELY THE MOBILE AND A AND A OR B. HAS ALREADY SPOKEN TO US ABOUT THAT. AND THEY ARE VERY INTERESTED IN DOING A MOBILE TESTING SO WE HAVE DO WE HAVE A COMMITMENT FROM A OR B. THAT THE YES IMPLEMENT. WHAT THEY SAID AS THEY INTEND TO DO MOBILE TESTING? THANK YOU IN MY QUESTIONS ALONG SIMILAR LINES AND I SALUTE THE AUTHOR A VERY VERY IMPORTANT PROGRAM IN ITS -- IT'S TIME -- TO PRESS FORWARD IN THIS AREA -- MY QUESTION IS REALLY MORE A PROCEDURE WHEN THE FEE PACKAGE COMES BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE. WILL ISSUES LIKE MR GRAYSON JUST ADDRESSED THE MOBILE -- OR KEY OSCAR APPROACH WILL THAT BE INCLUDED -- SO THAT IF THERE ARE DETAILS LACKING WERE MISSING FOURTH THERE'S THINGS WE DON'T LIKE. WILL HAVE -- ANOTHER BITE AT THE APPLE. SO WHAT OUR UNDERSTANDING IS IS IT WILL COME BACK TO US THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS AND IT WILL PROBABLY BE IN A TRAILER BILL SO WE WILL HAVE THE SAME OPPORTUNITY. TO DISCUSS IT AND ADD AND SUBTRACT LIKE WE DO WITH OTHER TRAILER BILL. IN HOW FAR OFF IN THE FUTURE DO YOU BELIEVE THIS WILL BE WOULD IT BE NEXT BUDGET PROCESS TWO YEARS. GOTCHA THANK YOU VERY MUCH MY LAST QUESTION. IT WAS A MENTION OF THREE REPORTS THAT WILL COME BACK NO WAS ONE OF THOSE THE FEE STRUCTURE YES AND THEN WHAT ARE THE OTHER TWO REPORTS THAT WILL BE COMING BACK SOMEBODY MENTIONED THREE MAYBE I MISUNDERSTOOD -- THE THOSE ARE ON THE PROGRAM ITSELF SO -- AIR BE WOULD BE EXPLAINING WHAT WILL BE IN THE PROGRAM SO YOU HAVE A CHANCE TO REVIEW THAT OKAY. SO THAT THE DETAILS THE OPERATIONAL DETAILS OF THE PROGRAM WILL BE. IN A REPORT IN IS THERE A THIRD OR DID I MISUNDERSTAND. SO TWO COMPONENTS THE FEE PROGRAM THE FEE STRUCTURE. IN THE OPERATIONAL COMPONENTS SO THERE IS ANOTHER REPORT AFTER -- AFTER POPE PROGRAMS IMPLEMENTED TO DISCUSS HOW IT'S BEING IMPLEMENTED AND TO GO INTO HOW THE ENFORCEMENT'S GOING AND TO JUST MAKE SURE THAT IT'S BEING ENFORCED PROPERLY. GOOD THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU MISLABELLED STRIPS. AS A CURE. FOR THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR FOR BRINGING THIS -- MEASURE BEFORE SOMETHING IS COMMON SENSE I DON'T THINK AS THE BALL FOR PRO SOMEONE'S COMMEND YOU ON THAT -- I HAVE A TRUST FACTOR. THEY ARE BEING IN TERMS OF FOLLOWING THROUGH -- THE WHAT IS BODY -- MAKES RECOMMENDATIONS TO LEGISLATION. AND SOME OF THOSE. DON'T GET IMPLEMENTED. AND SO -- REQUIRES A MANDATE HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT THE WORD MANDATE. TO MANDATE THIS WELL FIRST I WOULD SAY I AGREE WITH YOU THERE CAN BE SOME TRUST ISSUES -- WE HAVE NOT YET THOUGHT ABOUT A MANDATE MY HOPE WOULD BE THAT IF WE LEGISLATE THIS THEY WILL DO IT IF THEY DO NOT THEN YES WE WOULD PROBABLY HAVE TO LOOK AT A MANDATE. IS IT A MECHANISM IN THE BILL SOMEWHERE ME ABOUT OVERLOOKED IT IN TERMS OF WHERE. THIS WILL COME BACK IN TERMS OF THE REPORT -- TO THE BODIES OF THE LEGISLATURE TO THE SENATE YES I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE WERE JUST DISCUSSING RIGHT -- MISTER -- DALY WAS ASKING ABOUT THEY WILL COME BACK TO US SO THAT WE CAN SEE WHAT HAS BEEN DONE. AND EVALUATE THEM SO TO SPEAK. I'M SUPPORT YOUR YOUR CONCERN I HAVE PAUL'S YES OKAY I HAVE BECAUSE YOU KNOW I'M JUST CONCERNED SOMEONE TO BRING THAT TO ATTENTION I THINK IT'S A GOOD POP APPROACH I THINK IS MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. AND CERTAINLY -- YOU KNOW GRATEFUL TO SEE THE COALITION IS BEHIND THE BILL'S OBVIOUS SUPPORTING TODAY THANK YOU SOME OF THE ****. MR O'DONNELL YEAH I JUST I JUST START. ARE YOUR CREW THEN THE STORE. TO MY FRIEND FROM -- CARSON'S POINT -- WITH REGARD. TO SOME MISTRUST -- BETWEEN THIS BODY AND CARP I THINK -- THIS BILL MAY BE THE ANSWER TO THAT BECAUSE WHAT'S HAPPENED. BASICALLY TWO THOUSAND SIX IS THIS BODY HANDED OVER A LOT OF POWER TO AN EXECUTIVE AGENCY IN THAT AS YOU EXECUTIVE AGENCY. HAS BEEN DOING -- PRETTY MUCH WHAT THEY WANT WITHOUT POWER WITHOUT ANY CHECK FROM THIS BODY AND REALLY THIS BILL IS THIS. THIS BODIES CHANCE TO STEP UP AND SAY THIS IS THE FRAMEWORK FOR THIS PROGRAM THIS IS WHAT WE WE THE STATE LEGISLATURE WANTED TO LOOK LIKE THAT'S WHAT WE SHOULD BE DOING. WE SHOULD BE WEARING. IN MORE OFTEN ON CARBS ACTIVITIES WE SHOULD RESTRUCTURING THEM. BECAUSE THIS AND WORK COUNTABLE TO THEM THEY'RE AND THEY'RE NOT NECESSARILY ACCOUNTABLE TO US ALWAYS AND I THINK THIS IS A THIS IS A GOOD START IN THAT DIRECTION. THANK YOU MISTER. AGES -- ASSEMBLYMEMBER OF YOUR CREATURES IT'S OKAY. THANK YOU FOR BEING A FOR IT -- BUT I'M INCLINED TO SUPPORT IT TODAY. BUT I THINK THERE'S A LEGITIMATE ISSUES AND IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES OF THE FARM BUREAUS RAISING THAT MUST AND I THINK MUST BE ADDRESSED IN THE STATUTE -- IF THEY DON'T IF WE DON'T DO IT THAT WAY WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE THE CIRCLE WITH KERR -- AND I JUST WANT TO HOPE YOU'LL COMMIT TO ADDRESSING THESE ISSUES IN THE BILL BEFORE IT COMES UP FOR A VOTE ON THE ASSEMBLY FLOOR. I WILL NOT SUPPORT IF WE DON'T HAVE THAT CHANGED ABSOLUTELY FAIR WE DO NOT HAVE A SOLUTION AT THIS TIME BUT WE ARE ABSOLUTELY COMMITTED. TO MAKING SURE WE HAVE A PATH TO COMPLIANCE I THINK ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT WOULD BE MOST HELPFUL WOULD BE THE MOBILE UNIT BUT YES WE ABSOLUTELY SHARE YOUR CONCERN AND WE WANT TO GET TO A PATH TO COMPLIANCE SO THAT. IT WORKS FOR EVERYONE I WORRY ABOUT -- AS BEING A SMALL FARMER AND I KNOW WE HAVE A A PIECE OF MACHINERY. THAT WE DON'T DRIVE THAT OFTEN THAT TO GET TO GET TO A SMOG INSPECTION IS. LITERALLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR MOBILE UNIT WOULD BE PERFECT BUT I WANT TO KNOW THE IT'LL HAPPEN BECAUSE YOU KNOW PROMISES COULD BE MADE WE ALL DO APPEAR AND I JUST THINK THAT I WANT TO MAKE SURE ALL MY FARMERS ARE TAKING CARE OF AND I'M HOPING YOU CAN CONTAIN TO WORK. WITH FARM BUREAU THE CATALYST MOVE THAT FOR ABSOLUTELY APPRECIATE AND RESPECT THAT. NEAR THE QUESTIONS OF THE COMMITTEE OF THE AUTHOR. SEEING NONE CENTER WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. I JUST WANT TO THANK ALL OF THE STAKE HOLDERS WHO HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN THIS PROCESS BECAUSE THIS IS OUR THIRD YEAR WITH THIS BILL. AND EVERYONE HAS BEEN COMMITTED TO TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN MAKE IT WORK SO I APPRECIATE EVERYONE'S COMMITMENT TO MAKING SURE WE HAVE CLEAN AIR TO BREATHE AND THE AND ALSO MAKING SURE THAT PRODUCT DOESN'T -- GO TO THE WAYSIDE AND LIVESTOCK DOESN'T DIE ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD -- FRUITS AND VEGETABLES DON'T SPOIL ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD BUT WE WOULDN'T BE HERE TODAY IF IT WASN'T FOR EVERYBODY'S INTENTION TO TRY TO MAKE THIS WORK I AM ABSOLUTELY CONFIDENT THAT WE WILL GET TO WHERE WE NEED TO BE -- WILL BE PERFECT FOR EVERYONE MAYBE NOT BUT IF WE ALL WALK AWAY A LITTLE HAPPY A LITTLE BIT UNHAPPY I THINK WE CAN GET TO A PLACE THAT HOPEFULLY EVERYONE CAN SUPPORT IT. I GREW UP IN THE EARLY SEVENTIES IN CHINO I REMEMBER SMOG DAYS I REMEMBER NOT BEING ABLE TO SEE THE MOUNTAINS TODAY WE SEE THE MOUNTAINS MORE OFTEN BUT BECAUSE THE PARTICULATES ARE SO SMALL. THEY ARE JUST AS HARMFUL AND WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT IT SO IT'S A INCOMING UPON ALL OF US TO WORK TOGETHER. AND MAKE A COMMITMENT TO FUTURE GENERATIONS WITHOUT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR -- I APPRECIATE YOU WORKING WITH ALL OF THE STAKEHOLDERS ON THIS ON THIS BILL AND AND AGAIN AS YOU MENTIONED IN A THREE YEAR PROCESS. AND THINK IT'S IMPERATIVE TO RECOGNIZE THAT. AND YOU AND YOU MENTIONED ABOVE THE INDUSTRIES INVOLVED -- THERE HAS TO BE A BALANCE WE ALL WANT CLEAN AIR. BUT HOW DO WE GET TO YES AND I THINK THE THE ABILITY TO WORK WITH INDUSTRY THE EXPERTS IN THE FIELDS AND NOT TELL THEM. HOW TO COMPLY BUT ASK THEM HOW THEY CAN COMPLY? IS IS IMPERATIVE -- WHEN WE LOOK AT -- YOU KNOW SB. ONE THE TRUCKING INDUSTRY WAS ABSOLUTELY IMPERATIVE TO BE ON WITH THAT BILL SO THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY MAINTAIN OUR HIGHWAYS IN CALIFORNIA AS A PARTNER. THEY CAN THEY CONTINUE TO BE A PARTNER IN THIS PROCESS ALSO WHICH IS ADMIRABLE. BUT AT WHAT COST DO WE IMPALING THEM THE TRANSIT INDUSTRY IS AT HEAVILY SUBSIDIZED BY THE TRUCKING INDUSTRY. AND SO WE LOOK AT CLEAN AIR TRANSIT ALL OF THE THINGS ARE GOING BUT THEN THE CONSUMER IS IMPACTED AT SOME POINT. AND WE ALL END UP PAYING FOR IT DOWN THE ROAD. SO I LOVE THIS CAREFUL APPROACH THAT YOU'RE TAKING. CONSIDERING ALL THE AVENUES AND LISTENING TO THE INPUT OF THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS ALSO WHAT AND HOW IT IMPACTS OF MR GRAYSON THIS. YEAR CURRY. THAT HAS TO BE REMEDIED AGREED AND I APPRECIATE YOUR WILLINGNESS TO WORK WITH THE FARM INDUSTRY AND CATTLE WAS TO GO FORWARD. WITH THAT [inaudible] WITH THAT.

GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS. SB FOUR OH TWO IS A FIVE YEAR EXTENSION TO IN YOUR COUNTIES ADVENTURE TRAIL PILOT PROGRAM. IN TWENTY ELEVEN A. B. SIX TO EIGHT ESTABLISH THIS PILOT PROGRAM WHICH ALLOWED INYO COUNTY TO DESIGNATE SPECIFIC COUNTY ROADS AS COMBINED USE ROUTES FOR OFF HIGHWAY VEHICLE USE. UNFORTUNATELY DUE TO PROGRAM DELAYS BECAUSE OF LITIGATION. AND COURT ACTION THERE'S NOT BEEN ENOUGH TIME FOR A COMPREHENSIVE EVALUATION OF THE PILOT PROGRAM. THE GOALS OF THIS PROGRAM ARE TO INCREASE TRAFFIC SAFETY IMPROVE NATURAL RESOURCE PROTECTION. REDUCE OFF HIGHWAY VEHICLE TRESPASS ON PRIVATE LAND AND MINIMIZE IMPACTS ON COUNTY RESIDENTS. NEITHER THIS BILL NOR THE EXISTING PILOT PROGRAM. READ A SINGLE NEW TRAIL OR WROTE IT DOES HOWEVER CREATE A BETTER NETWORK OF TRAILS AND MORE IMPORTANTLY A LEGAL AND REGULATED MEANS TO ACCESS EXISTING MAINTAIN TRAILS. ADDITIONALLY BY HAVING A LINK TRAIL SYSTEM LAW ENFORCEMENT HAS THE TOOLS TO PROPERLY DIRECT OFF HIGHWAY VEHICLE USERS TO APPROVED ROUTES AND REDUCE THE NEED TO POLICE ILLEGAL ACTIVITY. THIS PROGRAM IS IMPORTANT TO THE LOCAL ECONOMY. INYO COUNTY WHICH CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF HIGH DESERT WITH WITH LESS THAN 2% PRIVATELY OWNED LAND. HAS A ROBUST ATV -- H. B. COMMUNITY AND RELIES EXTENSIVELY ON TOURISM DOLLARS. THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS. VOTED UNANIMOUSLY IN SUPPORT OF THIS EXTENSION. THE BILL HAS ALSO RECEIVED BIPARTISAN SUPPORT THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS. I RESPECTFULLY COLLEAGUES REQUEST YOUR AYE VOTE ON AS BEFORE -- TO IN ADDITION I AM JOINED BY INYO COUNTY SHERIFF JEFF HOLLOW WELL IN PAUL SMITH -- RULE COUNTY REPRESENTATIVE OF RC RC. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS. I AM JEFF FOLLOW CHEF OF INYO COUNTY I'M HERE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF SB FOUR TWO AND I'D LIKE TO MAKE JUST A COUPLE COMMENTS. THE VENTURE TRAILS PROGRAM IS BROAD PUBLIC SUPPORT. SINCE TWENTY FOURTEEN THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS OF AT TEN FORMAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE PUBLIC TO GIVE TESTIMONY. AND INTERACT WITH THE BOARD AS WELL AS THE PLANNING COMMISSION. AS IT RELATES TO THE ADVENTURE TRAILS PROGRAM. THE SHARE SERVICES HAD NO COMPLAINTS RELATED TO THE ADVENTURE TRAILS NO TRAIL PROLIFERATION REPORTED OR OBSERVED. NO ACCIDENTS NO LAW ENFORCEMENT INCIDENTS AND NONE OF THE PROJECTED OUTCOMES AS DESCRIBED BY THE OPPONENTS OF THE PROGRAM OF TAKEN PLACE. THE REPORTS OF VIOLATIONS -- ON OFF HIGHWAY VEHICLES THE SHERIFF'S OFFICE HAVE RECEIVED INVOLVED IN UNRELATED TO THE ADVENTURE TRAILS PROGRAM. THIS PROGRAM ALLOWS YOU ALWAYS FOR USERS TO USE EXISTING COUNTY MAINTAIN ROADS TO ACCESS CAMPGROUNDS TRAILS IN SERVICES. IT PROTECTS OUR NATURAL RESOURCES BY EDUCATING AND ENCOURAGING OR TO BE USERS TO RESPECT OUR DISTINCTIVE LANDSCAPE. THIRTY NINE OF THE FORTY FOUR MILES -- EXCUSE ME THIRTY NINE TO FORTY FOUR PROVED MILES ARE ACTUALLY PAVE ROADS MAINTAINED BY THE COUNTY THE REMAINING FIVE MILES ARE ALREADY APPROVED WRITING YOUR IS -- FOR EACH FEES. BY UTILIZING EXISTING ROADS TROUBLE INFORMATION AND ROSEN IS REDUCED. WE ENCOURAGE AND EDUCATE ALWAYS THREE GROUPS TO PARTICIPATE IN STORE CHIP PROJECTS FOR THE FEDERAL AND STATE AGENCIES THAT CONTROL MUCH OF OUR UNIQUE LANDSCAPE. THE PLANNING AND IMPLEMENTATION OF THE EIGHTY PROGRAM IS BEEN SOLELY FUNDED BY GREEN STICKER GRANT FUNDING. NO COUNTY GENERAL FUNDS HAVE BEEN USED. THE SMALL SCALE THE PROJECT SEVEN ROUTES. HAS LIMITED THE ECONOMIC BENEFITS BUT WE'RE STARTING TO SEE INCREASED USE OF THE SYSTEM PARTICULARLY OF A PRIVATELY OPERATED CAMPGROUND NEAR BISHOP. IN CLOSING I WOULD LIKE TO SAY. A PRIORITY FOR THIS PROJECT HAS ALWAYS BEEN INFORMING GAUGE OF PUBLIC IN THE RULES AND REGULATIONS FOR USE AND ENJOYMENT OF THE ADVENTURE TRAIL SYSTEM. MORE TIME IS NEEDED TO BOTH EDUCATE THE PUBLIC AND THE VALUE WITH THE PROGRAM. I ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT ON THIS BEFORE -- TWO AND CONTINUE THE ADVENTURE TROLLS PILOT PROGRAM THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO SPEAK THANK YOU NEXT FOR THIS PLACE TO HIS NAME WOULD BE REPRESENTING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS PAUL SMITH FROM THE REAL COUNTY REPRESENTATIVE CALIFORNIA JUST BRIEFLY WERE ASKING FOR ANOTHER EXTENSION BECAUSE DURING THE LAST -- EXTENSION BILL THAT CAME THROUGH NOT ALL OF THE TRAILS HAVE BEEN SANCTIONED AND COMPLETED AT THAT TIME SO THIS -- TIME PERIOD ALLOWS US TO HAVE A MORE THOROUGH STUDY THIS IS BEEN AN IMPORTANT ISSUE FROM ALL OF OUR MEMBERS WERE IN PARTICULARLY INYO COUNTY WHICH IS -- OBVIOUSLY A VERY KEEN AS THE SHERIFF SAID IN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AS WELL AS WRITER SAFETY AND TRAFFIC SAFETY AS WE ARE COURAGEOUS BUILT ON THE FORWARD. THANK YOU ANY OTHER MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC THAT WOULD LIKE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THE AUTHORS BILL. MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC TO LIKE TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION OR SHARE CONCERNS WITH OTHERS BILL. PLEASE COME ON P. STATE YOUR NAME THE REPRESENTING. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR MEMBERS I'M CATHERINE GARCIA BEHALF OF SIERRA CLUB CALIFORNIA. EVEN WITH THE AMENDMENTS FROM THE SENATE NATURAL RESOURCES AND WATER COMMITTEE CIRCLE CALIFORNIA RESPECTFULLY OPPOSES SENATE BILL. FOUR OH TWO BY EXTENDING THE POORLY CONCEIVED COMBINED USE PILOT PROJECT. UNDER AB SIX TWENTY EIGHT FROM TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN IN IN YOUR COUNTY. SET TO EXPIRE ON JANUARY FIRST. TWENTY TWENTY SETTING IT TO TWENTY TWENTY FIVE THIS BILL WOULD OPEN OF LAND AND NATURAL RESOURCES TO POTENTIAL ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION. THE INITIAL PILOT PROJECT HAS GIVEN RISE TO MANY SERIOUS ISSUES IN IN YOUR COUNTY. INCLUDING HEALTH AND SAFETY CONCERNS LICENSING INSURANCE AND LIABILITY NOISE AND TRAFFIC INCREASES IN LOCAL COMMUNITIES. AIR QUALITY IMPACTS FROM DUSTIN EMISSIONS AND SIGNIFICANT IMPACT NATURAL RESOURCES. EXTENDING SUCH A PROGRAM TO TWENTY TWENTY FIVE WILL ONLY EXACERBATE THESE ISSUES. AND WHILE WE ARE GRATEFUL THAT THE SENATE NATURAL RESOURCES COMMITTEE AMENDED THE BILL TO REQUIRE AN INTERIM ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW IT IS WELL DOCUMENTED THAT -- EACH FEE USE CAN BE DETRIMENTAL TO RARE AND IMPERILED SPECIES LIVING ON NATURAL LANCE AS SUCH WE ASK THAT THE COMMITTEE VOTE NO ON THIS BEFORE A TWO THANK YOU THANK YOU. ANY OTHER MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC LIKE SPEAK IN OPPOSITION TO THE AUTHORS BILL [inaudible] SEEING NONE. MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OF THE AUTHOR. SENATOR WHICH LIKE CLOSE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ENSURING FRAZIER -- I JUST WANTED TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT --FOR ANY FOLKS THAT MAY HAVE QUESTIONS ON HOW COOPERATIVE -- WE HAVE BEEN IN MAKING CERTAIN THAT -- WE HONOR A PILOT PROGRAM WHICH IS PREMISED ON GATHERING INFORMATION -- WHICH HERE TO FORCE BEEN STALLED -- WE VOLUNTEERED IN FACT BROUGHT IT UP OURSELVES THAT -- FOR THOSE THAT MIGHT HAVE ANY ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS THAT WE WOULD HAVE AN ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW MID TERM UP THE CYCLE AND THAT PLEASED A LOT OF THE FOLKS ON THAT HAD SOME CONCERNS. BUT MY LAST POINT WOULD BE FOR THOSE FOLKS WHO CARE ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT. WE CERTAINLY DO FOR THOSE THAT -- THAT -- HAVE HAVE HAD CONCERNS IN THE PAST. THE IRONY IS IS THAT BY HAVING THESE DUAL USE ROADS AND MAINTAIN CREATING THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR THEM WE ARE IN FACT. PROTECTING THE ENVIRONMENT KEEPING THESE WROTE THESE -- OFF HIGHWAY VEHICLES OUT OF THE NATURAL SPACE IN IT BRING THEM BACK INTO -- A MORE REGULATED ENVIRONMENT. SO WITH THAT I APPRECIATE -- ON THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT -- THIS -- THIS -- BILL AS BEFORE -- TOO AND I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST RIGHT. THANK YOU SENATOR. SO BE SUPPORTING YOUR BILL TODAY.

IT IS A WILL LEAVE THE ROLE PERHAPS MEMBERS CONGRATULATIONS THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS THANK YOU. OKAY WERE WAITING FOR A I UNDERSTANDING IS MISTER ALLEN'S ON HIS WAY CENTER AROUND SO. WE'LL WAIT. TO FOR A COUPLE MINUTES [inaudible] WE BELIEVE [inaudible] ZERO ONE GOOD TO SEE SIR THANK HERE SO WE'LL DO -- LET'S TO SB FIFTY NINE FIRST SIR AND THEN WE'LL GO TO YOUR SECOND AND TESTING THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. WELL LET ME START BY -- THINKING THE COMMITTEE OF THE CHAIR FOR ALL THE WORK THAT WAS DONE ON THIS MEASURE. YEAH I THINK WE'RE NOW TO PLACE RELIEF -- GOT TO A COMPREHENSIVE BILL THAT WE CAN. ALL BE PROUD OF I'M I'M -- ACCEPTING ALL THE EVENTS IN THE ARE AND WHICH I THINK WERE DISTRIBUTED. TO THE COMMITTEE LATE LAST WEEK -- SO. NOW THIS HAS TO DO WITH AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES IN THE INTRODUCTION OF AUTONOMOUS PASSENGER VEHICLES ONTO OUR ROADS IN WITHIN OUR COMMUNITIES. HAS THE POTENTIAL TO REVOLUTIONIZE. THE WAY THAT WE GET AROUND RECEIVE OUR COMMUNITIES. NOW THERE'S A LOT OF POTENTIAL POSITIVES RIGHT THIS INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGY COULD DRASTICALLY REDUCE. COLLISIONS ENHANCE TRAFFIC FLOW VERY PROMISING -- BUT I THINK THERE'S A FEAR THAT IF NOT PROP AND NOT THOUGHTFULLY DEPLOYED THIS MOBILITY REVOLUTION. I COULD HAVE SOME NEGATIVE IMPACTS SOME SIGNIFICANT EGGMAN IMPACT INCLUDING EXACERBATING ALL CALIFORNIA'S ALREADY SEVERE CLIMATE AIR QUALITY PLANNING AND CONGESTION. CHALLENGES. THE MEDIA ONE EXAMPLE THERE WAS A AN EXPERIMENT CONDUCTED BY FOLKS YOU SEE DAVIS BERKELEY. AND GEORGE ATTACK AND THEY MIMIC TO LIFE. WITH THE NAVY -- BASICALLY YOU KNOW PROVIDING EVERYONE WITH -- EVERY PARTICIPATING HOUSEHOLD WITH THE SHOW FOR AN EXPERIMENT SHOWED THAT THE HOUSEHOLDS TRAVELED. 83% MORE MILES PER WEEK -- WITH MORE THAN A FIFTH OF THE VEHICLE TRIPS ACTUALLY CARRY NO PASSENGERS AT ALL -- BECAUSE IT'S SO CONVENIENT JUST TO HAVE A DRIVERLESS CAR YOU KNOW THAT AND AND THE YOU WOULD YOU BASICALLY USE IT MORE. AND THEY WOULD OFTEN TIMES -- HAVE THE CAR LOOK JUST CIRCLE ROUND AND ROUND WAITING FOR THEM AS OPPOSED TO PARKING -- SO AS TO BE ABLE TO BE READY AND AVAILABLE TO PICK THEM UP WHEN THEY'RE READY TO GO WITHOUT OF COURSE INCREASED CONGESTION. SO -- THERE COULD BE SOME DOWNSIDES TO THIS TECHNOLOGY FOR NOT SMART ABOUT IT AND I THINK -- WITH ME TO ONE OF THE THINGS WE WERE LOOKING TO DO WITH SB FIFTY NINE IS TO CREATE A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH. TO ADDRESSING THIS ISSUE AND IT ULTIMATELY THAT THE THE BILL CREATES THE CALIFORNIA COUNCIL THE FUTURE TRANSPORTATION. TO DELIBERATELY PLANNED FOR AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES IN A WAY THAT SUPPORTS OUR GOALS IN TERMS OF SAFETY TRANSPORTATION CLIMATE SUSTAINABILITY. SO THIS COUNCIL OF CASTLE BRING TOGETHER STATE LOCAL AGENCIES -- BRING THEM TOGETHER WITH STAKEHOLDERS TO CRAFT POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WILL THEN BE DELIVERED TO THE LEGISLATURE IT'S AN INTENTIONAL PROCESS AND IT'S OUR HOPE THAT THIS CAN HELP CALIFORNIA. RESPONSIBLY GUIDE THE DEPLOYMENT OF THIS REVOLUTIONARY TECHNOLOGY. WITH THIS COMMITTEE WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH MANY STAKEHOLDERS INCLUDING INDUSTRY GROUPS AUTOMAKERS ENVIRONMENTALISTS PLANNERS TO REFINE THE MEASURE ENSURE THAT WE DELIBERATELY -- PLAN WHILE NOT STYMIE. THIS INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGY SO WE ALL KNOW THAT WE HAVE TO BEFORE THINKING WHEN IT COMES THE VIS -- AT THIS BILL ESTABLISHES A FRAMEWORK TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE. AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK WHENEVER. THANK YOU HAVE A WITNESSES WORD SENATOR. GET EXTENSION IN HERE UPS AND GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND MEMBERS CHASTENED BY THOSE AT THE UNION OF CONCERNED SCIENTISTS -- HERE IN SUPPORT OF THE BELL AT SELF DRIVING CARS MAY BE THE MOST SIGNIFICANT INNOVATION TRANSPORTATION SINCE THE INVENTION OF THE AUTOMOBILE. AND THOUGH STILL IN THEIR INFANCY -- THESE VEHICLES COULD RADICALLY TRANSFORM HOW PEOPLE AND GOODS MOVE AROUND WITH PROFOUND IMPLICATIONS GOOD OR BAD. FOR SAFETY EQUITY IN THE ENVIRONMENT. AND IT'S TIME FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO ASSESS THE OPPORTUNITIES AND RISKS. THIS TECHNOLOGY PRESENTS DETERMINE THE FORWARD LOOKING POLICIES THAT WILL BE NEEDED TO STEER AVISA POSITIVE DIRECTION. HI SO I THE UNION OF CONCERNED SCIENTISTS WERE PARTICULARLY FOCUSED ON ADDRESSING THE CLIMATE CRISIS AND ARE LOOKING AT THE RULES THAT EIGHTIES WILL PLAY -- IN THAT AND AS WITH MANY ASPECTS OF THIS TECHNOLOGY WE SEE BOTH RISKS AN OPPORTUNITY -- AND SO WE ARE PARTICULAR GLAD TO THE BILL WITH THE AMENDMENTS BEING TAKEN TODAY WILL RETAIN A KEY FOCUS ON ISSUES OF POLLUTION CONGESTION.

SIX SIX FOUR SEVEN THANK YOU ABOUT WHAT ONCE AGAIN -- ONE I THINK THE CONSULTANTS -- IN BOTH OF THE PARTIES AT THIS COMMITTEE THE CHAIR OF THE COMMITTEE. AS WELL FOR THE HARD WORK ON THIS BILL -- I'M VERY HAPPY TO TAKE A PROPOSED MMA WHICH I RIVER IT'S CURRENT LANGUAGE REGARDING PHOTOGRAPHIC EVIDENCE AND HOT HI HI. YOU KNOW I I COULD SEE TOLL LANES TO EXACTLY AS A REASON CURRENT LAW. AND I ALSO -- COMMITTEE WORKING WITH THIS COMMITTEE THROUGH THE CHAIR AND STAFF TO REFINE LANGUAGE IN THE BILL -- THAT -- REFINED REFINING WHICH IN THE BILL THE SUFFICIENTLY ADDRESSED CONCERNS RAISED BY PROPOSED AMENDMENT BE. I AGREE THAT -- THE NOTICES OF TOLL FEES AND FINES SHOULD BE SUFFICIENT SO DRIVERS ARE RESPONSIBLE PARTIES ARE AWARE OF ANY CHANGE CHARGES IN A TIMELY MANNER. YOU CAN PAY WHAT THEY OWE I I THINK THAT YOU'VE HAD CONVERSATIONS WITH OUR STAFF AND OUR WORKING OUT -- THAT. THAT ISSUE -- SO. THE GROUP OF IN A GOOD DIRECTION TOGETHER. SO MEMBERS CALIFORNIA'S REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION AGENCIES BUILD OPERATE AND MAINTAIN ROADS BRIDGES AND TRANSIT INFRASTRUCTURE. AND SERVICES ON BEHALF OF THE PUBLIC SO THIS BILL AFFIRMS THAT THESE AGENCIES HAVE CLEAR AUTHORITY. TO RESPONSIBLE USE PERSONAL INFORMATION FOR NECESSARY DAY TO DAY ACTIVITIES TO OPERATE TOLLS AND REGIONAL TRANSIT SYSTEMS ON THE PUBLIC'S BEHALF. HERE'S HOW WE COME TO THIS ISSUE OVER RECENT MONTHS A GROWING LIST OF LITIGANTS. SOME PETITIONING FOR CLASS ACTION STATUS HOW FILED CLAIMS AGAINST REGIONAL TOLL AGENCIES AND CONTRACTORS CALIFORNIA. ALLEGING VIOLATIONS THAT IMPERIL BILLIONS IN TAXPAYER DOLLARS. NOW THERE'S BEEN SOME LAWSUITS THAT MAKE BROAD ASSERTIONS OF FEDERAL AND STATE CONSTITUTIONAL VIOLATIONS WHICH COURTS HAVE. TO DATE LARGELY BRUSHED ASIDE -- BUT BUT PLEASE ALSO POINT TO MILLIONS OF REPORTED INDIVIDUAL VIOLATIONS OF STREETS AND HIGHWAYS SECTION. CODE SECTION THIRTY ONE FOR NINETY WHICH WAS ESTABLISHED IN TWENTY TEN THROUGH LEGISLATION AUTHORED BY SENATOR JOSEPH MEDIAN THIS IS SB. TWELVE SIXTY EIGHT NOW THE WELL DOCUMENTED INTENT A SENTENCE TO MILLIONS BILL WAS TO CODIFY UNIFORM STANDARDS ACROSS ALL OF CALIFORNIA'S. TOTALING AGENCIES TO PROTECT AGAINST PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION OF CONSUMERS BEING PROVIDED TO COMPANIES ORGANISATIONS FOR MARKETING OR INAPPROPRIATE USES THAT WAS THE GOAL IN FACT YET IS A FACT SHEET THAT WE TRACKED DOWN FROM -- THE THE TIME WHEN HE WAS -- GIVEN THE BILL PASSED. TWENTY TEN ANY DETAILS HOW THE BILL WAS CRAFTED TO NOT HINDER A TRANSPORTATION AGENCY FROM FINANCIAL ACTIVITIES REQUIRED TO OPERATE AND MANAGE TOLL FACILITIES INCLUDING THE SHARING OF DATA. TO ENSURE INTER OPERABILITY OF TOLL COLLECTION DEVICES AND TECHNOLOGIES. NOW -- BECAUSE THE PROVISIONS OF THIS BILL APPLY RETROACTIVELY AND WHAT IMPACT PENDING LITIGATION IT REALLY DOES DESERVE SCREENING FROM LAWMAKERS. I TO ENSURE THAT ITS INTENT IS IN WITH THE PUBLIC INTERESTED IN LINE WITH -- SB. TWELVE SIXTY EIGHT SERIES CONSUMER INJURIES CAN AND DO OCCUR WHEN SENSITIVE AND PRIVATE INFORMATION IS SHARED FOR MARKETING OR INAPPROPRIATE PURPOSES. THAT'S NOT WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO GET OUT HERE RIGHT WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE NOT LETTING CORPORATIONS OFF THE HOOK FOR FAILING TO PROTECT YOUR CREDIT CARD DATA. COMPANIES A FREE PASS FOR PROFITING FROM USERS MEDICAL HISTORY INSTEAD THE BILL DEFENDS THE VITAL PUBLIC INTEREST THE OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE OF A COMPREHENSIVE. TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE AND I THINK FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE ABSENT CLEAR EVIDENCE THAT CALIFORNIA'S ARE BETTER OFF OF MILLIONS OF OF BILLIONS OF TAX DOLLARS ARE IMPERILED -- FOR FOR THE SORTS OF VIOLATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN BROUGHT UP BY THESE -- BY THESE CASES I SB SIX SIXTY FOUR PROVIDES AN IMPORTANT AND NECESSARY CLARIFICATION OF STATE LAW TO CONTINUE ALLOWING TRANSPORTATION AGENCIES TO USE PERSONAL DATA EFFICIENTLY RESPONSIBLY WHILE MAINTAINING APPROPRIATE PROHIBITIONS AGAINST IMPROPER SHARING ABOUT INFORMATION I THINK THAT. THE ISSUES THAT WE WORKED OUT WITH THE COMMITTEE HELP TO ENSURE THAT THE BILL CERTAINLY ALSO IF PASSED OUT OF COMMITTEE TODAY WILL GO TO PRIVACY. COMMITTEE WHERE -- WHERE WILL CONTINUE TO HONE THOSE PROTECTIONS OF OF CONSUMERS AND WITH ME HERE TODAY WE HAVE REBEKAH LONG FROM THE MATCH ONE TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION MTC? AND ALSO CENTRAL JOHNSON WHO IS THE CHIEF TOLL OPERATIONS OFFICER FOR THE TRANSPORTATION CORRIDOR AGENCIES OF ORANGE COUNTY. AND SHARE THE CALIFORNIA TOLL OPERATORS COMMITTEE.

SEE TALK ALSO PARTNERS WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF MOTOR VEHICLES IN UTILIZES THEIR STANDARDS FOR IDENTIFYING VEHICLE OWNERS AND REINFORCING THE PAYMENT OF TOLLS. ARE AGENCIES COLLABORATED WITH SENATORS MANY ITS OFFICE ON THE LANGUAGE AND SB TWELVE SIXTY EIGHT TO ENSURE THE PROPER HANDLING OF PERSONAL DATA. THE TOLD ME AGENCIES HAVE IT HERE TO THE LAW AND ITS INTENT AND THERE'S BEEN NO BREACHES OF PRIVACY. SALES OF CUSTOMER DATA OR CONSUMER HARM FROM AGENCIES TONY OPERATIONS. HOWEVER CLARIFICATIONS IN THE LAW ARE NEEDED TO COMBAT FALSE ASSERTIONS AROUND MISCONCEIVED GRAY AREAS -- IN THE LANGUAGE OF THE ASSERTIONS PUT FOR CALL INTO QUESTION THE DAY TO DAY OPERATING ACTIVITIES AND PRACTICES OF OUR AGENCIES. AND THREATEN OUR MEMBERS WITH HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN FINES FOR DOING SIMPLE THINGS SUCH AS COMMUNICATING WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF MOTOR VEHICLES TO GET SOMEONE'S ADDRESS TO MAIL THEM A NOTICE. COMPLYING WITH STATE MANDATED INTER OPERABILITY BY SHARING INFORMATION NEEDED TO PROVIDE A CALIFORNIA RESIDENT OR A CUSTOMER WITH A SINGLE ACCOUNT THAT THEY CAN YOU STATE WHY. FOR USING THE US POSTAL SERVICE FOR MAILING NOTICES. FROM USING VENDORS TO SUPPORT OUR SYSTEMS AND AND PROCESS TOLLS. AND THEN PLAYING BOTH SIDES OF THE COIN PLAINTIFFS ATTORNEYS HAVE ALSO CLAIM THAT WE VIOLATE THE LAW WE WE CONDUCT A SKIP TRACE TO FIND THE CORRECT ADDRESS FOR USER. WHILE ALSO CLAIMING THAT WE VIOLATE THE LAW WHEN WE DON'T DO A SKIP TRACE TO FIND THE CORRECT ADDRESS FOR A FOR A VEHICLE OWNER. SB SIX SIXTY FOUR WOULD CLEAR CLEAR UP THESE GRAY AREAS AND CAUGHT A FIVE ORIGINAL INTENT.

ANY MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC THAT HAVE -- WOULD LIKE TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION TO THE AUTHORS BILL OR WILSHIRE CONCERNS PLEASE SUPPORT. PLEASE TO JAMIE REPRESENT PLEASE. GOOD AFTERNOON -- RICHARD HALL OVER WITH THE CONSUMER FEDERATION OF CALIFORNIA AND WE DO APPRECIATE THE WORK OF OF THE COMMITTEE. TO CRAFT SOME PROPOSED AMENDMENTS THAT WE THINK START TO MOVE IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION ALTHOUGH THERE CERTAINLY. OF MORE WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE ON THOSE AMENDMENTS THE CONSUMER FEDERATION OF CALIFORNIA WORKED VERY CLOSELY WITH US SENATOR SYMMETRY IN. BACK IN TWENTY TEN AT THAT TIME -- THERE WERE MANY CONCERNS BEING RAISED ABOUT THE PRIVACY OF INFORMATION GATHERED FROM MOTORISTS WHO SUBSCRIBE TO ELECTRONIC TOLL COLLECTION SYSTEMS. AND THESE HAVE ONLY CONTINUE TO GROW IN THEIR DOMINANCE AROUND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. OF THESE SYSTEMS HAVE ACCESS TO VERY VERY PERSONAL INFORMATION. NAME ADDRESS EMAIL OF PHONE NUMBERS CREDIT CARD OR BANK ACCOUNT INFORMATION AND AS YOU TRAVEL THE ROADS. THE LOCATIONS THAT YOUR TRAVEL SAVE GEOLOCATION INFORMATION AND THEY HAVE TRAFFIC PATTERN INFORMATION THIS IS SENSITIVE INFORMATION. THAT WAS BEING. USED IMPROPERLY SO -- WE SUPPORTED US SENATE BILL TWELVE SIXTY EIGHT AND I WANT TO NOTE THAT SEVERAL OF THE TRANSPORTATION AGENCIES INITIALLY OPPOSED THAT BILL. AND WHEN MR SO MEDIAN -- EXCERPTED AMENDMENTS THAT ADDRESS THEIR CONCERNS THAT MAINLY DEALT WITH THE LENGTH OF TIME THAT THESE RECORDS ARE RETAINED. THEY DROP THEIR OPPOSITION THE BILL HAD NO OPPOSITION IN THIS FINAL FORM IT WAS. APPROVED WITH STRONG BIPARTISAN SUPPORT AND SIGNED INTO LAW BY GOVERNOR SCHWARZENEGGER SO. OF WE ARE CONCERNED WITH SEVERAL ASPECTS OF THE BILL. THAT AFFECT PRIVACY UNDER CURRENT LAW. OF IN ORDER -- FOR A TOLLING AGENCY TO USE OR SHARE YOUR INFORMATION IT REQUIRES A WRITTEN. CONSENT AN OPT IN CONSENT THIS LEGISLATION WOULD CHANGE WOULD IN ADDITION TO THAT WRITTEN UP AND ESTABLISH AN ELECTRONIC OPTED. AND I'M SURE MANY OF YOU HAVE USED EITHER CELL PHONES OR OTHER -- MOBILE DEVICES TO SIGN UP FOR VARIOUS KINDS OF SERVICES AND PRODUCTS AND USUALLY YOU GOT TO SCROLL THROUGH FORTY FIFTY PAGES OF LEGAL GOBBLEDYGOOK THAT NOBODY READS. AND EMBEDDED IN THAT IS THE OFTEN SO PEOPLE DO NOT READ THOSE ELECTRONIC CONSENT FORMS WE'VE WORKED ON OTHER BILLS TRYING. TO MAKE SURE THAT THE OPT IN CONSENT IS A SEPARATE ACT FROM THIS THE ACT OF SIGNING UP FOR THE SERVICE BUT TYPICALLY IT IS EMBEDDED AND NO ONE BOTHERS TO LOOK TO FIGURE OUT HOW. TO UNCHECK THE OPTION SO THERE'S A PROBLEM WITH THAT. THE THE OTHER PROBLEM WE HAVE IS IT REVERSES THE ENFORCEMENT SCHEME. UNDER CURRENT LAW THE OF VIOLATION OF SOMEONE'S PRIVACY HAS ENUMERATED MONETARY DAMAGES THIS IS ONE OF SEVERAL LAWS. THAT PROVIDE FOR MONETARY DAMAGES AND IN MISTER ALLEN'S OF STATEMENT THAT THIS DOES NOT AFFECT MEDICAL PRIVACY WILL OF COURSE IT IS NOT BECAUSE THESE AGENCIES DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO THAT INFORMATION HOWEVER. ONE POINT OUT OF OUR RELATIONS SOMEONE'S MEDICAL PRIVACY UNDER CALIFORNIA LAW SUBJECTS THE THE THE VIOLATOR TO ENUMERATED MONETARY DAMAGES AND MISTER ALLEN ALSO SAID HE DOESN'T CREDIT CARD PRIVACY. AGAIN THE SONG BEVERLY CREDIT CARD ACT WHICH COVERS CREDIT CARD PRIVACY DOES ALSO ENUMERATE MONETARY DAMAGES SERVICE SO YOU TO WRAP IT UP OKAY SO THE REVERSAL OF THAT SCHEME WOULD A RADIC KATE THE ACCESS TO JOBS AS MOST IMPORTANT THOUGH I WANT TO POINT OUT. RETROACTIVITY IS A VERY VERY SERIOUS MATTER IS POINTED OUT IN THE UP IN THE ANALYSIS THIS IS AN EFFORT TO IMPACT CURRENT PENDING LITIGATION BY SAYING WE'RE GOING TO GO BACK EIGHT YEARS AND REYES THE RULES UNDER WHICH THESE AGENCIES. OF WERE EXPECTED TO OPERATE WE CAN HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT GOING FORWARD LOOKING AT CHANGES THAT NEED TO BE MADE BUT TRYING TO RETRO. ACTIVELY REYES EIGHT YEARS OF THE WAR YOU KNOW THAT THE LAW IS JUST A AN ABSOLUTELY HORRENDOUS WAY TO APPROACH LAWMAKERS THANK YOU THANKS WITH THIS PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME HERE REPRESENTING PLACE. MY NAME IS ADAM GOT RIDE. OF I AM A LAWYER FOR A COURT APPOINTED CLASS OF MOTORISTS IN CALIFORNIA WHO'VE BEEN CHARGED TOLL VIOLATIONS. DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE MOST NOTICES THAT WERE SENT TO THEM WERE RETURNED UNDELIVERABLE AS ADDRESSED. AND MY OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL TODAY HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THESE PRIVACY CONCERNS THAT YOU'VE HEARD SO MUCH ABOUT BUT FOCUSES ENTIRELY ON THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS TO VEHICLE CODE SECTION -- FOR TWO FIVE FOUR WHICH WAS ADDED BY AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT BILL NOT IN TWO THOUSAND TEN BUT IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWO AT THAT. SECTION OF THE BILL REQUIRES THE TOWING AGENCIES TO USE THE PAST EFFORTS TO FIND AN UPDATED ADDRESS WHEN THE MALES RETURNED UNDELIVERABLE. WHAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW -- BUT IS THAT SEVERAL TOLL AGENCIES WHEN THEY WE GET THESE MAIL NOTICES RETURNED UNDELIVERABLE IS THAT THEY DO ABSOLUTELY NOTHING WITH THEM. AND THAT TOLL VIOLATIONS ARE ACCRUING EVEN THOUGH IT'S KNOWN TO THE AGENCIES THAT THE MAIL WAS NOT DELIVERED. THE LEGISLATIVE HISTORY EXPLAINS THAT THE PURPOSE OF THE BEST EFFORTS REQUIREMENT IN THE TWO THOUSAND AND TWO STATUTE WAS -- TO WAS SPECIFICALLY TO DEAL WITH THE SITUATION WHERE THE DMV. DOES NOT HAVE A CURRENT ADDRESS OF THE MOTORIST. AND SO. THE AMENDMENTS THAT ARE PROPOSED THAT ARE SORT OF DROPPED INTO THIS BILL WHICH MOSTLY CONCERNS OTHER ISSUES BUT THE PROPOSED. THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS TO THE EXISTING LAW AND SB. SIX FOUR FOUR WHICH IS THIS RATE THAT REQUIREMENT THAT THE AGENCIES USE THEIR BEST EFFORTS BY REPLACING IT WITH A VERY VAGUELY WORDED PROVISION THAT. RELYING ON THE DMV IS PRIMA FACIA EVIDENCE OF PAST EFFORTS. AND THAT OPENS A WHOLE HOST OF PROBLEMS. THAT ARE GOING TO BE FACED IN FURTHER LITIGATION AS TO WHAT IT WOULD MEAN. IN THE CONTEXT OF MY CASE FOR EXAMPLE WHEN YOU HAVE. NOTICE TO THE AGENCIES THAT THE ADDRESS THAT THE MAIL IS NOT BEING DELIVERED. THE STAFF OF THIS COMMITTEE HAS. A PROPOSED TO ALL OF THE MEMBERS THAT AMENDMENTS BEING MADE TO SB SIX FOUR FOUR TO ACCOUNT FOR THIS SPECIFIC ISSUE. AND THAT IS THAT THEY WOULD REQUIRE THE AGENCIES TO TAKE-SPECIFIC ACTIONS WHEN MAIL IS RETURNED. I'M SO FAR SENATOR ALLEN HAS NOT AGREED TO THOSE AMENDMENTS BUT AT WHAT HE SAID EARLIER WAS THAT HE WOULD AGREE TO WORK WITH THE COMMITTEE -- AND WE WOULD WELCOME THE CONTINUING INVOLVEMENT OF THE CHAIR AND THE COMMITTEE ON HAVING THOSE AMENDMENTS AND WOOD I OPPOSE THE BILL UNLESS. THEY ARE AMENDED AS THE COMMITTEE STAFF HAS RECOMMENDED THANK YOU THANK YOU NEXT WITH THIS PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME. AND WHO REPRESENTING IN THE IF YOU'RE IN COMPLETE AGREEMENT WITH THE OTHER WITNESSES PLEASE SHISEIDO. MR TEAR MEMBERS ROSE MERRY SHAMPOOS AND CONSUMERS FOR AUTO RELIABILITY SAFETY WE SHARE THE CONCERNS RAISED BY THE OTHER OPPONENTS BUT LEAVING MONTHS RESPECTFULLY ALSO OPPOSE THE BILL. AND I WOULD JUST NOTE -- THAT IN THE ANALYSIS THE ANALYSIS STATES THE CHANGES AN EVIDENTIARY BURDEN THE REDUCTION IN WHAT CONSTITUTES BEST EFFORT THE CAPPING OF DAMAGES SEEM TO STACK THE DECK AGAINST THE WRONGFULLY ACCUSED CITIZEN. IN FAVOR TRANSPORTATION AGENCY AND WE HEAR ON A REGULAR BASIS FROM YOUR CONSTITUENTS WHO ARE HAVING TROUBLE WITH THEIR VEHICLE REGISTRATION AND JUST GETTING THE VEHICLES REGISTERED IN THEIR OWN NAME AND IN COMMUNICATIONS. PEOPLE DO NOT ALWAYS UNFORTUNATELY GET NOTICED WHEN THERE'S A A TOLL VIOLATION AND FOR PEOPLE TO LOSE THEIR CAR. WHICH IS WHAT TOO OFTEN HAPPENS WHEN THERE ARE PROBLEMS -- AND THEY HAVEN'T PAID THEIR TOLD. FOR A LOT OF CALIFORNIANS THAT MEANS THEIR LIFE BASICALLY FALLS APART SO WE NEED TO BE CAREFUL ON IN IN WHAT WE ALLOW THE TOLL AGENCIES TO DO. THANK YOU THANK YOU YOU THE WITNESSES PLEASE TEACH NAME YOU'RE REPRESENTING PLEASE. FROM MISTER CHAMBERS AT NAS YOUR HERNANDEZ ON BEHALF OF THE UTILITY REFORM NETWORK OR TURN WERE OPPOSE WE DO ENCOURAGE THE COMMITTEE TO LOOK AT TWO ISSUES THAT WERE NOT REYES WHICH IS -- IT THIS BILL WILL ALLOW THE COLLECTION OF PHONE NUMBERS FOR DRIVERS WHICH WE BELIEVE ISN'T ALLOWED UNDER CURRENT LAW. AND ALSO CREATES A NEW STANDARD FOR PRIME APHASIA EVIDENCE OF A VIOLATION OF A TOLL OF A TOLL VIOLATION -- RETROACTIVE WHICH MEANS DRIVERSWHO AREN'T IN VIOLATION TODAY FOR SOMETHING THEY DID LAST YEAR MAY BE IN VIOLATION IF THIS BILL PASSES FOR SOMETHING YOU DID LAST YEAR THOSE ARE TWO ISSUES THAT NEED TO BE ADDRESSED I THINK IN THIS COMMITTEE. SEVEN ATTACK OR THE CONSUMER ATTORNEYS OF CALIFORNIA IN OPPOSITION WE ALIGN OURSELVES OF MR GOT RIGHTS COMMENTS IN IT COME TO NOTICE AND URGE THE AUTHOR AND COMMITTEE TO CONTINUE WORKING ON THAT ISSUE WE ALSO OPPOSE AND PRIVACY GROUNDS THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC THAT LIKE TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION OR HAVE CONCERNS OF THE AUTHORS BILL. SEEING NONE QUESTIONS OF THE COMMITTEE OF THE AUTHOR. CENTER WHICH LIKE CLOSE PLEASE. WELL I I REALLY DO APPRECIATE THAT THE ROBUST DISCUSSION AND AND I MEAN ULTIMATELY I I REALLY THINK WE WE LOOK AT THIS IS GETTING TO THE CORE GOALS. THAT CENTER SOME MILLION -- LAID OUT WHEN HE WAS FIRST PROPOSING THE BILL AND AND THIS WAS ALLOWING. TRANSPORTATION AGENCIES TO DO THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING FUNCTIONS THAT THEY NEED TO DO IN TERMS OF ENFORCEMENT -- BUT I WHERE I STAND VERY COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH THE OPPOSITION -- AS THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD SPECIAL OVER TO IT AT THE PRIVACY COMMITTEE TO ENSURE THE THEY KEEP PRIVACY ISSUES ARE ARE ADDRESSED AND AND THAT THIS REALLY YEAH. TREATS CONSUMERS AS THEY ARE TO BE TREATED WITH FAIRNESS AND WITH RESPECT FOR THEIR PRIVACY -- AND JUST THIS IS ULTIMATELY ALL ABOUT. ONLY ABOUT ALLOWING THE TRANSPORTATION AGENCIES -- TO ME TO PERFORM THEIR BASIC FUNCTIONS THAT WE EXPECT THEM TO TO PERFORM IN ORDER TO CARRY OUT. THE THE WORK THAT WE'VE BEEN TAUGHT WE WE WE TRUSTED THEM WITH SO -- I WILL SAY MY STAFF HAS CONNECTED WITH LITIGANTS TO GET A BETTER SENSE OF THE HARM THEY SUFFERED -- THEY SEEM TO HAVE TROUBLE COMING UP WITH MUCH THAT IS REALLY TANGIBLE -- YOU KNOW NONE OF THE LET IT LIKE IT'S A SHOWN THAT THEIR CLIENTS PERSON ONE IN FIVE FIVE ONE INFORMATION WAS SOLD TO MARKETERS ARE USE ANYWAY THAT -- ANY ANYTHING EXCEPT FOR USED TO FACILITATE THE COLLECTION OF TOLLS WHICH AS I SAY WAS EXPLICITLY MENTION AS IT AS A IMPORTANT TASK AND FUNCTION OF THE AGENCIES NEED TO CARRY OUT. BY SUBMITTING HIMSELF WHEN HE PROPOSED THE BILL -- SO. YOU KNOW I I CERTAINLY DON'T. LOVE TOLL ROADS WHEN I I'M I'M I'M ON THE WEST COAST GUY THINK THEY'RE THEY'RE WAY TOO COMMITTED TO THE MONEY SITE IS BECAUSE I COLLEGE ICE TO MY WITNESSES HERE BUT YOU KNOW I REALLY DO YOU SAY THAT. YOU KNOW THE DAY OF THE AGENCIES AND MANAGE THEM ARE DOING EXACTLY WHAT CENTERS MILLIONS OWN FACTUALLY CLAIM WAS PERMITTED UNDER THE STATUTE HE AUTHORED -- BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF LAWSUITS -- SEEMS TO REALLY BE UNREASONABLY HIGH PRICE TO ASK THE PUBLIC TO PAY IN AND LET'S REMEMBER THAT'S MONEY IT'S COMING OUT OF TRANSIT PROJECTS HIGHWAY PROJECTS ETCETERA. AND SO WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK RIGHT. THANK SENATOR ALLEN -- AS MUCH AS ANYONE I WANT TO PROTECT TRANSPORTATION FUNDING FROM WAYS FOR FRIVOLOUS LAWSUITS. I ENCOURAGE THE CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY PATROL IS UNDERS UNDER FUNDED UNDER STAFF TO TO WORK WITH THE TOTALING AUTHORITIES. FOR TOLL EVASION THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA AS MUCH AS THEY CAN WE WORKED THROUGH LEGISLATION. TO MAKE SURE THAT PROPER -- PLATES WERE ON THE VEHICLES SO THAT FOR TELEVISION WE'VE WORKED IN EVERY ASPECT IS THROUGH THIS COMMITTEE TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY CAN PROSPER. AND DO THE WORK THAT THEY THEY INTEND TO DO -- BUT WHEN THIS FIRST BILLS FIRST DISCUSSED WITH ME. I WAS TOLD IT WAS. A DIFFERENT BILL AND WE WERE CLARIFYING THAT WE WERE COVERING LEGISLATION TEN WHEN WE PASS THIS MEDIUM BUILD IN. TWENTY TEN AND NOW THAT I OF NOW I UNDERSTAND THE BILL GOES FAR BEYOND WAS SOLD TO ME. AND I WAS A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED IN HOW THAT. ACTUALLY HAPPENED. AND FRANKLY FRUSTRATED WITH THE WAY THIS WENT DOWN AND I EXPECT BETTER FROM MY FRIENDS AND TRANSPORTATION WORLD. ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY WANT MY SUPPORT. AND I'VE GIVEN MY SUPPORT FOR THIS INDUSTRY. SENATOR ALLEN I APPRECIATE A WILLINGNESS IN AGAIN. I'VE NEVER SEEN YOU AGAINST THE CONSUMER ATTORNEYS. HERE WE ARE. AND YOU KNOW I APPRECIATE YOU -- WHAT THE WILLINGNESS TO AMEND THE BILL IN THE NEXT COMMITTEE -- IT'S PLEASE COOKIE PORTAL MY CONSULTANTS SAY HAVE A REALLY GOOD HANDLE ON THIS AND THEY HAVE BEEN DOING THIS FOR MANY YEARS AND WORK WELL.

TO COMMENTS BECAUSE THERE WASN'T NO RECOMMENDATION I WASN'T SURE WHERE YOU'RE GOING. I THINK THE BILL IS A VERY CREDIBLE FOUGHT FULL BILL.

THIS IS A THERE'S A PROBLEM STATEWIDE WITH ALL THESE AGENCIES RIGHT NOW AND WE NEED TO DO OUR JOB AND HELP CLEARED UP AND CLARIFY -- THE RULES IN THE PROCEDURES. AND SO I THINK IT'S A THOUGHTFUL. WISE BILL AND AGAIN I APPRECIATE THE COMMITMENT OF THE AUTHOR TO ADDRESS THESE PRIVACY ISSUES -- IN THE APPROPRIATE COMMITTEE SO ALL THE SUPPORTING THE BILL AND IF WE DON'T ACT TODAY AND MOVE FORWARD I THINK WE'RE JUST GONNA YOU KNOW -- THIS CONTINUING UNCERTAINTY WILL PREVAIL AND THAT'S NOT AND THAT'S NOT GOOD.
