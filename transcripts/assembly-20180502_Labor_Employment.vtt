BUT THE PROVISIONS OF THIS BILL

00:36:37.062 --> 00:36:39.931 region:rollup2

CHEAPER THAN EVER AYE YOU TO

00:45:07.071 --> 00:45:09.207 region:rollup2
THERE'S NO OPPORTUNITY FOR

00:45:07.605 --> 00:45:10.675 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION WITH OTHER THE

00:45:09.207 --> 00:45:12.977 region:rollup2

ARE THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES I

00:45:15.947 --> 00:45:18.482 region:rollup2
THINK.

00:45:16.614 --> 00:45:20.284 region:rollup2
AND AND MOST FOLKS INCLUDING

00:45:18.482 --> 00:45:21.552 region:rollup2
THE HOTEL WORKERS MANY OF WHOM

00:45:20.284 --> 00:45:22.753 region:rollup2
MCCARTY HAVE SMARTPHONES AT THE

OF THAT COST IS A REAL CONCERN I

00:45:26.624 --> 00:45:29.560 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT. I DON'T THINK

ANYONE TRY DRIVE UP BECAUSE THIS

00:45:29.560 --> 00:45:32.063 region:rollup2
REALLY BUT THAT'S WHAT'S THE

00:45:30.528 --> 00:45:33.497 region:rollup2
MOST EFFECTIVE WAY OF MAKING

00:45:32.063 --> 00:45:35.166 region:rollup2
SURE THAT IF SOMEONE IS IN

00:45:33.497 --> 00:45:36.834 region:rollup2
DANGER THAT THEIR HELPED. AND I

00:45:35.166 --> 00:45:38.903 region:rollup2
CAN'T IMAGINE I DON'T KNOW OF

00:45:36.834 --> 00:45:40.838 region:rollup2
AND CAN'T IMAGINE ANY. HOTEL

00:45:38.903 --> 00:45:42.373 region:rollup2
MANAGEMENT OR OWNER THAT IF

00:45:40.838 --> 00:45:43.007 region:rollup2
THEIR WORK WAS IN TROUBLE THEY

00:45:42.373 --> 00:45:43.741 region:rollup2
WOULD WANT TO BE THERE IN AN

00:45:43.007 --> 00:45:45.476 region:rollup2
INSTANT.

00:45:43.741 --> 00:45:46.344 region:rollup2
AND AND IF THAT'S NOT THE CASE

00:45:45.476 --> 00:45:47.712 region:rollup2
YOU WOULDN'T WANT TO WORK FOR

00:45:46.344 --> 00:45:49.347 region:rollup2
SOMEONE LIKE THAT THAT WOULDN'T

00:45:47.712 --> 00:45:52.149 region:rollup2
WANT TO BE THERE WHEN SOMEONE IS

00:45:49.347 --> 00:45:54.151 region:rollup2
IS LEGITIMATELY. IN TROUBLE AND

00:45:52.149 --> 00:45:54.919 region:rollup2
SO I THINK THAT THAT THAT CAN BE

00:45:54.151 --> 00:45:57.088 region:rollup2
FIGURED OUT.

00:45:54.919 --> 00:45:58.189 region:rollup2

00:49:19.590 --> 00:49:23.227 region:rollup2
AND.

00:49:21.058 --> 00:49:24.662 region:rollup2
THERE ARE.

00:49:23.227 --> 00:49:26.630 region:rollup2
THERE'S TRAINING PROGRAMS TO TO

00:49:24.662 --> 00:49:29.166 region:rollup2
TO LET PEOPLE KNOW TO TO WHAT TO

00:49:26.630 --> 00:49:30.935 region:rollup2
WATCH FOR I MEAN FOR EXAMPLE

TWO TOGETHER.

00:49:36.440 --> 00:49:39.477 region:rollup2
SO THAT YOU DON'T KNOW NOBODY'S

00:49:38.008 --> 00:49:41.479 region:rollup2
BOTTOMS YOU KNOW BY THEMSELVES

AND THE LARGER HOTELS OR. WHAT

00:49:41.479 --> 00:49:45.249 region:rollup2
IS THE STATE WHAT HOTEL STILL

00:49:43.147 --> 00:49:47.685 region:rollup2
USES THAT STANDARD I'M CURIOUS?

00:49:45.249 --> 00:49:49.286 region:rollup2
I I HAVEN'T SEEN THAT STANDARD.

00:49:47.685 --> 00:49:50.488 region:rollup2
LAST LAST FEW WHEN I WAS I WAS

00:49:50.488 --> 00:49:54.391 region:rollup2
OKAY WELL.

00:49:52.923 --> 00:49:55.759 region:rollup2
I MEAN I'VE ONLY I'VE ONLY SEEN

00:49:54.391 --> 00:49:57.061 region:rollup2
THE STANDARD OF UNIONIZED MAIDS

00:49:55.759 --> 00:49:58.262 region:rollup2
WHICH HAVE A HIGHER STANDARD

00:49:57.061 --> 00:49:59.964 region:rollup2
THAN NON UNION AND I HAVEN'T

00:49:58.262 --> 00:50:01.265 region:rollup2
SEEN.

00:49:59.964 --> 00:50:02.733 region:rollup2
DUAL WORKERS IN AWHILE I COULD

00:50:01.265 --> 00:50:04.401 region:rollup2
BE WRONG I'M NOT AN EXPERT IN

00:50:02.733 --> 00:50:05.536 region:rollup2
THE INDUSTRY ADJUSTS.

00:50:04.401 --> 00:50:06.837 region:rollup2
ALRIGHT THAT THE MAIDS ARE

00:50:05.536 --> 00:50:08.672 region:rollup2
SAYING THAT'S NOT REALLY A

00:50:06.837 --> 00:50:11.108 region:rollup2
STANDARD IN THE BUSINESS SO.

00:50:08.672 --> 00:50:13.878 region:rollup2
BESIDES BESIDES MAYBE THE HOTEL

00:50:11.108 --> 00:50:15.880 region:rollup2
THAT USES TO. WORKERS AND.

00:50:13.878 --> 00:50:18.015 region:rollup2
WHAT I HEARD FROM YOU IS YOUR

00:50:15.880 --> 00:50:19.783 region:rollup2
TRAINING THE WORKERS BUT?

00:50:18.015 --> 00:50:21.652 region:rollup2
THE WORKER CANNOT DETERMINE THE

00:50:19.783 --> 00:50:24.588 region:rollup2
WORKER CAN'T BE TRAINED AGAINST

00:50:21.652 --> 00:50:25.322 region:rollup2
BEING VIOLATED.

00:50:24.588 --> 00:50:26.824 region:rollup2
FROM FROM A PATRON OPENING THE

DOOR.

00:50:26.824 --> 00:50:29.493 region:rollup2
RIGHT HOW HOW CAN YOU TRAIN A

00:50:27.858 --> 00:50:30.961 region:rollup2
WORKER.

00:50:29.493 --> 00:50:34.131 region:rollup2
TO STOP A GUEST FROM.

00:50:30.961 --> 00:50:35.399 region:rollup2
VIOLATING THEM.

00:50:34.131 --> 00:50:37.134 region:rollup2
DOES THAT MAKE SENSE DON'T

00:50:35.399 --> 00:50:39.470 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT WHAT YOU CAN AND WHAT

00:50:37.134 --> 00:50:42.806 region:rollup2
WE CAN DO IS IS TO. TO TO CREATE

00:50:39.470 --> 00:50:43.908 region:rollup2

WRECK RIGHT NOW WHEN WHEN.

00:50:44.775 --> 00:50:50.047 region:rollup2
A LET'S SAY IT'S MADE.

00:50:47.778 --> 00:50:51.181 region:rollup2
THE CLEAN ROOM TO A SEVEN.

00:50:50.047 --> 00:50:52.316 region:rollup2
THREE DAYS IN ROW THEY'VE

00:50:51.181 --> 00:50:55.219 region:rollup2
COMPLAINED EVERYDAY THE PATRON

00:50:52.316 --> 00:50:56.954 region:rollup2

00:50:55.219 --> 00:50:58.989 region:rollup2
AND HE'S NAKED OR SHE'S MAKE IT.

00:50:56.954 --> 00:51:00.958 region:rollup2
WHAT HAPPENS?

00:50:58.989 --> 00:51:02.026 region:rollup2
THERE'S NO RULE FOR THE GASTRITE

00:51:00.958 --> 00:51:03.260 region:rollup2
SIDE ASSUME THE HOTEL CAN'T

00:51:02.026 --> 00:51:04.094 region:rollup2
REALLY TELL THE GAS THAT THEY'VE

00:51:03.260 --> 00:51:09.099 region:rollup2
DONE SOMETHING WRONG WHAT WHAT

00:51:04.094 --> 00:51:10.000 region:rollup2
HAPPENS.

00:51:09.099 --> 00:51:11.535 region:rollup2
DEPENDS ON WHAT EACH HOTEL HOW

00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:13.003 region:rollup2
THEY WOULD.

00:51:11.535 --> 00:51:14.305 region:rollup2
SO I WOULD VENTURE TO SAY AND I

00:51:13.003 --> 00:51:15.673 region:rollup2
I COULD BE WRONG AGAIN I'M NOT

00:51:14.305 --> 00:51:17.408 region:rollup2
AN EXPERT I LIVE IN A HOTEL THE

00:51:15.673 --> 00:51:18.776 region:rollup2
NON EXPERT AND SKILLED AT ALL. I

00:51:17.408 --> 00:51:20.744 region:rollup2
JUST WOULD VENTURE TO SAY THAT

00:51:18.776 --> 00:51:22.379 region:rollup2
PROBABLY NOTHING HAPPENS.

00:51:20.744 --> 00:51:23.614 region:rollup2
RIGHT I MEAN I'VE NEVER HEARD OF

00:51:22.379 --> 00:51:26.083 region:rollup2
SOMETHING HAPPENING.

00:51:23.614 --> 00:51:26.917 region:rollup2
BESIDES IF.

00:51:26.083 --> 00:51:28.919 region:rollup2
I'M JUST WONDERING BECAUSE I.

00:51:26.917 --> 00:51:29.887 region:rollup2
DO WE HAVE.

00:51:28.919 --> 00:51:31.255 region:rollup2
IS THERE A STANDARD IN THE

00:51:29.887 --> 00:51:32.623 region:rollup2
INDUSTRY THIS IS AN ONGOING

00:51:31.255 --> 00:51:34.491 region:rollup2
SERIOUS ISSUE THAT'S BEEN

00:51:32.623 --> 00:51:35.059 region:rollup2
HAPPENING FOR YEARS AND IT JUST

00:51:34.491 --> 00:51:37.962 region:rollup2
SEEMS THAT THERE'S NO REAL

00:51:35.059 --> 00:51:39.897 region:rollup2
STANDARD. I'M FOR PROTECTING.

00:51:37.962 --> 00:51:41.131 region:rollup2
THESE WOMEN IF YOU WOULD SIR IF

00:51:39.897 --> 00:51:42.700 region:rollup2
YOU IDENTIFY YOURSELF ARE YOU

00:51:41.131 --> 00:51:44.101 region:rollup2
ABLE TO SPEAK TO THE ASSEMBLY

00:51:42.700 --> 00:51:45.536 region:rollup2
MEMBERS QUESTIONS NOTHING WE

CALIFORNIA HOTEL LODGING

00:51:46.770 --> 00:51:49.139 region:rollup2
ASSOCIATION SO THERE ARE CODE OF

00:51:48.372 --> 00:51:52.276 region:rollup2
CONDUCT.

00:51:49.139 --> 00:51:55.012 region:rollup2
AND MANY HOTELS HAVE THEM BUT

00:51:52.276 --> 00:51:56.480 region:rollup2
ITS OWN INDIVIDUAL BASIS OR.

00:51:55.012 --> 00:51:59.483 region:rollup2
I GET THE BRAND BASIS SO SOME

00:51:56.480 --> 00:51:59.650 region:rollup2
HOTELS WILL HAVE WON SOME DOWN

00:51:59.483 --> 00:52:01.218 region:rollup2
TO.

00:51:59.650 --> 00:52:03.220 region:rollup2
AND IT DEPENDS ON THEIR

00:52:01.218 --> 00:52:05.990 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUAL BRAND IN TERMS OF

00:52:03.220 --> 00:52:07.458 region:rollup2
YOUR EXAMPLE OF A HOTEL GUEST

00:52:05.990 --> 00:52:08.492 region:rollup2
EXPOSING THEMSELVES I'M IF

00:52:07.458 --> 00:52:11.295 region:rollup2
THAT'S REPORTED.

00:52:08.492 --> 00:52:13.464 region:rollup2
THAT HOTEL GUEST IS GOING TO BE

00:52:11.295 --> 00:52:14.631 region:rollup2
ADDRESSED AND IF THAT'S NOT

00:52:13.464 --> 00:52:16.133 region:rollup2
RESOLVED AT THAT POINT.

00:52:14.631 --> 00:52:17.468 region:rollup2
THAT HOTEL GUESTS WILL BE ASKED

00:52:16.133 --> 00:52:19.470 region:rollup2
TO LEAVE WE WILL REFUSE THEM

00:52:17.468 --> 00:52:21.238 region:rollup2
SERVICE SO HAVING THAT HAPPENED

00:52:19.470 --> 00:52:22.439 region:rollup2
THREE TIMES IN A ROW THAT'S NOT

00:52:21.238 --> 00:52:25.042 region:rollup2
A REALITY.

00:52:22.439 --> 00:52:26.043 region:rollup2
IN IN THE INDUSTRY AT ALL NOT

00:52:25.042 --> 00:52:27.144 region:rollup2
NOT FOR THE SAME GAS THERE'S NO

00:52:26.043 --> 00:52:28.879 region:rollup2
WAY. VERY BUT IF I.

00:52:27.144 --> 00:52:30.814 region:rollup2
HAD SOMEBODY EXPOSE ME ON THE

00:52:28.879 --> 00:52:33.684 region:rollup2
STREET THAT THE POLICE WOULD BE

00:52:30.814 --> 00:52:35.419 region:rollup2
CALLED.

00:52:33.684 --> 00:52:36.954 region:rollup2
OKAY SHOW BUY I THAT WE DON'T

00:52:35.419 --> 00:52:38.088 region:rollup2
HAVE A SNEAK I'M I'M JUST KIND

00:52:36.954 --> 00:52:40.624 region:rollup2
OF UNDER I'M TRYING TO

00:52:38.088 --> 00:52:42.192 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND SO. IT'S A AWKWARD

00:52:40.624 --> 00:52:43.560 region:rollup2
SITUATION BY IT FILE MEANS LIKE

00:52:42.192 --> 00:52:45.095 region:rollup2
I SAID I LIVE IN A HOTEL SO I

00:52:43.560 --> 00:52:45.696 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND HOW AWKWARD IS FOR

00:52:45.095 --> 00:52:46.630 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY BUSINESS TRAVELERS

00:52:45.696 --> 00:52:48.065 region:rollup2
TO.

00:52:46.630 --> 00:52:50.968 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THE SUMS LIKE YOUR

00:52:48.065 --> 00:52:52.202 region:rollup2
PLACE OF LIVING AND. SO. I AGREE

00:52:50.968 --> 00:52:53.070 region:rollup2
THERE CAN BIG THERE CAN BE

00:52:52.202 --> 00:52:55.539 region:rollup2
GASSED

00:52:53.070 --> 00:52:57.307 region:rollup2
IN TERMS OF GUEST EDUCATION I'M

00:52:55.539 --> 00:52:58.742 region:rollup2
AND WHAT THEY DO BUT I'M GONNA

00:52:57.307 --> 00:53:00.978 region:rollup2
SAY THAT THE NORMAL PERSON AND

00:52:58.742 --> 00:53:01.645 region:rollup2
THE AVERAGE VISITOR. KNOWS THAT

00:53:00.978 --> 00:53:02.613 region:rollup2
THEY SHOULDN'T ANSWER THEIR DOOR

00:53:01.645 --> 00:53:04.314 region:rollup2
NAKED.

00:53:02.613 --> 00:53:06.583 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THAT'S JUST A

00:53:04.314 --> 00:53:07.618 region:rollup2
STANDARD OF SOCIETY SO I THINK

00:53:06.583 --> 00:53:09.019 region:rollup2
THAT WE'RE DEALING AYE I

00:53:07.618 --> 00:53:11.155 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND THAT IT'S A STANDARD

00:53:09.019 --> 00:53:13.023 region:rollup2
OF SOCIETY NOT TO. TOOK ABOUT

00:53:11.155 --> 00:53:15.225 region:rollup2
YOURSELF ANYBODY BUT IT HAPPENS

00:53:13.023 --> 00:53:16.560 region:rollup2
AND AND I THINK THAT MOST OF OUR

00:53:15.225 --> 00:53:17.761 region:rollup2
WHERE I WAS GOING WITH THIS IS.

00:53:16.560 --> 00:53:19.196 region:rollup2
FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE ON THE

00:53:17.761 --> 00:53:20.664 region:rollup2
HOTEL SIDE WERE INTERESTED

00:53:19.196 --> 00:53:23.333 region:rollup2
PROTECTING THE WORKERS AND

00:53:20.664 --> 00:53:25.035 region:rollup2
INTERESTED IN PROTECTING THEM SO

00:53:23.333 --> 00:53:26.570 region:rollup2
JOHN MENTIONED TO DO AROUND.

00:53:25.035 --> 00:53:27.871 region:rollup2
IT'S MORE TO DO A FLOOR OR

00:53:26.570 --> 00:53:29.807 region:rollup2
PUTTING THEM ON THE FLOOR.

00:53:27.871 --> 00:53:31.909 region:rollup2
MEAN AND WITH A SUPERVISOR AS

00:53:29.807 --> 00:53:32.709 region:rollup2
WELL OR ANOTHER HOUSE MINUTES

00:53:31.909 --> 00:53:34.678 region:rollup2
WELL SO THERE'S SAFETY IN

00:53:32.709 --> 00:53:36.080 region:rollup2
NUMBERS SO WE HAVE A LOT OF

00:53:34.678 --> 00:53:37.214 region:rollup2
HOTELS THAT HAVE VOLUNTARILY PUT

00:53:36.080 --> 00:53:38.782 region:rollup2
IN PANIC BUTTONS.

00:53:37.214 --> 00:53:40.417 region:rollup2
AND THEY HAVE THOSE AND THEN

00:53:38.782 --> 00:53:42.553 region:rollup2
THERE'S ALL KINDS OF OPERATIONAL

00:53:40.417 --> 00:53:43.387 region:rollup2
ISSUES IN TERMS OF HOW THEY

00:53:42.553 --> 00:53:44.855 region:rollup2
POSITION THE CARTS.

00:53:43.387 --> 00:53:46.356 region:rollup2
.

00:53:44.855 --> 00:53:48.459 region:rollup2
HOUSEKEEPERS GENERALLY DON'T GO

00:53:46.356 --> 00:53:50.394 region:rollup2
INTO A ROOM WHERE THERE IS

00:53:48.459 --> 00:53:52.062 region:rollup2
SOMEONE THERE TO CLEAN THE ROOM.

00:53:50.394 --> 00:53:54.431 region:rollup2
THAT IS NOT STANDARD PROTOCOL NO

00:53:52.062 --> 00:53:56.767 region:rollup2
ONE IS USUALLY IN A HOTEL ROOM

00:53:54.431 --> 00:53:57.601 region:rollup2
WHEN THE GUEST IS IN THAT ROOM.

00:53:56.767 --> 00:53:59.937 region:rollup2
THE ONLY TIME THAT I'VE EVER

00:53:57.601 --> 00:54:01.638 region:rollup2
SEEN THAT IS FOR TURNDOWN

00:53:59.937 --> 00:54:03.273 region:rollup2
SERVICE WHERE IT'S REAL QUICK

00:54:01.638 --> 00:54:03.841 region:rollup2
HEY DO YOU WANT SOME WATER SO I

00:54:03.273 --> 00:54:05.375 region:rollup2
MEAN HE'S TURNED OUT. YES I

00:54:03.841 --> 00:54:07.911 region:rollup2
WILL.

00:54:05.375 --> 00:54:09.847 region:rollup2
HAVE YOU TALKED TO HOTEL WORKERS

00:54:07.911 --> 00:54:10.013 region:rollup2
ABOUT THIS BECAUSE I HAD A LOT

00:54:09.847 --> 00:54:11.448 region:rollup2
OF.

00:54:10.013 --> 00:54:13.851 region:rollup2
.

00:54:11.448 --> 00:54:14.785 region:rollup2
IT.

00:54:13.851 --> 00:54:16.653 region:rollup2
OKAY MAYBE WE'VE JUST HAD

00:54:14.785 --> 00:54:18.655 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT EXPERIENCES OF COURSE

00:54:16.653 --> 00:54:21.024 region:rollup2
MY EXPERIENCE IS ONLY. AS HOTEL

00:54:18.655 --> 00:54:22.593 region:rollup2
GUESTS AND THEN SEPARATELY AS A.

00:54:21.024 --> 00:54:24.361 region:rollup2
WORKER ADVOCATE THAT I DID

00:54:22.593 --> 00:54:25.529 region:rollup2
BEFORE I CAME HERE AND HEARD A

00:54:24.361 --> 00:54:27.898 region:rollup2
LOT OF STORIES FROM WORKERS

00:54:25.529 --> 00:54:29.433 region:rollup2
HOTEL WORKERS ABOUT THINGS THAT

00:54:27.898 --> 00:54:31.702 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUAL GAS CAN DO LIKE.

00:54:29.433 --> 00:54:34.371 region:rollup2
COME ON AND I DON'T I JUST

00:54:31.702 --> 00:54:37.074 region:rollup2
WANTED TO TAKE HER MY TRASH AND.

00:54:34.371 --> 00:54:39.209 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW MY TOWELS AND YOU KNOW

00:54:37.074 --> 00:54:41.612 region:rollup2
THAT IS IT IT. COMMON STANDARD

00:54:39.209 --> 00:54:42.980 region:rollup2
PROCEDURE IS FOR THE HOUSEKEEPER

00:54:41.612 --> 00:54:44.081 region:rollup2
ONLY TO BE IN THE ROOM WHEN

00:54:42.980 --> 00:54:47.384 region:rollup2
THERE'S NO CAST IN THE BROWN.

00:54:44.081 --> 00:54:48.652 region:rollup2
SO HOUSE KEEPER SHOULD NOT ENTER

00:54:47.384 --> 00:54:50.254 region:rollup2
THAT ROOM WHEN A GAS IS IN THE

00:54:48.652 --> 00:54:51.555 region:rollup2
ROOM UNLESS THE GUESTS IF

00:54:50.254 --> 00:54:53.123 region:rollup2
THEY'RE COMFORTABLE WITH IT AND

00:54:51.555 --> 00:54:55.526 region:rollup2
I GUESS REQUESTED.

00:54:53.123 --> 00:54:57.461 region:rollup2
INFILL THERE TWENTY ROOMS TO BE

00:54:55.526 --> 00:54:59.163 region:rollup2
CLEANED WITHIN THEIR SHIFT.

00:54:57.461 --> 00:55:00.364 region:rollup2
AYE OKAY.

00:54:59.163 --> 00:55:02.599 region:rollup2
I MEAN TAKE YOUR WORD FOR IT

00:55:00.364 --> 00:55:03.867 region:rollup2
THAT WE SHOULD ALL JUST ABIDE BY

00:55:02.599 --> 00:55:05.669 region:rollup2
COMMON DECENCY AND THAT THERE

00:55:03.867 --> 00:55:07.471 region:rollup2
ARE SOME STANDARD POSSIBLY THAT

00:55:05.669 --> 00:55:09.706 region:rollup2
EXISTS WITH SOME HOTELS. AND

00:55:07.471 --> 00:55:11.308 region:rollup2
THAT SOMETIMES MAYBE MAYBE OUR

00:55:09.706 --> 00:55:14.778 region:rollup2
HOUSEKEEPERS SOME.

00:55:11.308 --> 00:55:16.346 region:rollup2
SOME. VERY GOOD EMPLOYERS GIVE

00:55:14.778 --> 00:55:17.748 region:rollup2
THEM THE OPPORTUNITY NOT GO INTO

00:55:16.346 --> 00:55:19.416 region:rollup2
A ROOM AND YOU KNOW MAYBE THEY

00:55:17.748 --> 00:55:20.617 region:rollup2
DON'T GET THEIR ROOMS CLEAN THAT

00:55:19.416 --> 00:55:22.085 region:rollup2
THEY NEED TO GET. CLEAN DURING

00:55:20.617 --> 00:55:23.821 region:rollup2
THEIR SHIFT BECAUSE I KNOW.

00:55:22.085 --> 00:55:24.154 region:rollup2
HOTEL OWNERS AREN'T STRICT ABOUT

00:55:23.821 --> 00:55:25.823 region:rollup2
THAT AT ALL.

00:55:24.154 --> 00:55:27.691 region:rollup2
BUT LET'S SAY IT EXISTS OUT

00:55:25.823 --> 00:55:28.992 region:rollup2
THERE.

00:55:27.691 --> 00:55:30.627 region:rollup2
DON'T YOU SEE WHERE THERE'S NO

00:55:28.992 --> 00:55:32.529 region:rollup2
STANDARD THAT'S PROTECTING THESE

00:55:30.627 --> 00:55:34.264 region:rollup2
MAINLY FEMALE WORKERS THERE'S NO

00:55:32.529 --> 00:55:35.465 region:rollup2
I'D LIKE EVEN THAT'S WHERE.

00:55:34.264 --> 00:55:37.701 region:rollup2
WE'RE DISAGREEING ABOUT WHAT

00:55:35.465 --> 00:55:38.302 region:rollup2
HAPPENS MAJORITY OF THE TIME

00:55:37.701 --> 00:55:41.205 region:rollup2
JUST FROM TALKING TO DIFFERENT

00:55:38.302 --> 00:55:44.041 region:rollup2
WORKERS.

00:55:41.205 --> 00:55:45.809 region:rollup2
I I GUESS I LOOK AT IT FROM WE

00:55:44.041 --> 00:55:47.711 region:rollup2
HAVE A FRAMEWORK

00:55:45.809 --> 00:55:49.179 region:rollup2
FOR SEXUAL HARASSMENT SHOULD

00:55:47.711 --> 00:55:50.581 region:rollup2
SIXTY TWO WE HAVE A FRAMEWORK

00:55:49.179 --> 00:55:52.482 region:rollup2
FOR THIS AND WE ALREADY HAVE

00:55:50.581 --> 00:55:53.550 region:rollup2
PROCESSES AND PROCEDURES. ARE

00:55:52.482 --> 00:55:55.252 region:rollup2
MANAGERS ALL TAKE SEXUAL

HARASSMENT TRAINING WERE OUT

00:55:55.252 --> 00:55:59.489 region:rollup2
THERE AT THIS IS WHERE AN INNER

00:55:56.687 --> 00:56:00.057 region:rollup2
EDUCATING AS MUCH AS WE CAN ON

00:55:59.489 --> 00:56:01.024 region:rollup2
THIS TO BRING THIS UP TO THE

00:56:00.057 --> 00:56:02.659 region:rollup2
ISSUE.

00:56:01.024 --> 00:56:04.094 region:rollup2
OUR HOUSEKEEPERS ARE INCREDIBLY

00:56:02.659 --> 00:56:05.762 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT AND VALUABLE TO US.

00:56:04.094 --> 00:56:06.663 region:rollup2
AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT

00:56:05.762 --> 00:56:10.133 region:rollup2
THEY HAVE A SAFE WORKING

00:56:06.663 --> 00:56:10.767 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENT AS WELL SO WE WANT

00:56:10.133 --> 00:56:13.070 region:rollup2
TO DO THE RIGHT THING HERE AND

00:56:10.767 --> 00:56:15.739 region:rollup2
WE WANT O EDUCATE. SO FAR

00:56:13.070 --> 00:56:16.773 region:rollup2
EDUCATION HAS FOCUSED PRIMARILY

00:56:15.739 --> 00:56:18.075 region:rollup2
ON KEEPING THE WORKERS OUT OF

00:56:16.773 --> 00:56:19.309 region:rollup2
HARM'S WAY.

00:56:18.075 --> 00:56:20.611 region:rollup2
HOW DID YOU IT WHAT TO DO IT

00:56:19.309 --> 00:56:22.112 region:rollup2
WHAT THE SAFETY PRECAUTIONS ARE

00:56:20.611 --> 00:56:23.647 region:rollup2
WITH THE PROTOCOLS ARE?

00:56:22.112 --> 00:56:25.549 region:rollup2
EVERY MAJOR BRAND

00:56:23.647 --> 00:56:27.251 region:rollup2
HAS SAFETY AND AND SECURITY

00:56:25.549 --> 00:56:29.186 region:rollup2
PROCEDURES IN THE HOTEL. JUST

00:56:27.251 --> 00:56:30.654 region:rollup2
BEYOND THE SEXUAL HARASSMENT

00:56:29.186 --> 00:56:32.055 region:rollup2
EVERYTHING ELSE WE'VE GOT OTHER

00:56:30.654 --> 00:56:33.790 region:rollup2
SAFETY ISSUES AS WELL IT'S

00:56:32.055 --> 00:56:35.292 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY A A BIG ISSUE IN OUR

00:56:33.790 --> 00:56:36.727 region:rollup2
INDUSTRY SHOWING WE ARE ALWAYS

00:56:35.292 --> 00:56:38.128 region:rollup2
EVOLVING IN TERMS OF WHAT THOSE

00:56:36.727 --> 00:56:39.329 region:rollup2
STANDARDS ARE. AND WHAT THOSE

00:56:38.128 --> 00:56:40.364 region:rollup2
PROTOCOLS ARE

00:56:39.329 --> 00:56:42.132 region:rollup2
SO HAVE YOU SEEN SOME OF THE

00:56:40.364 --> 00:56:42.633 region:rollup2
SURVEYS DONE BY UNITE HERE ABOUT

00:56:42.132 --> 00:56:44.835 region:rollup2
WHAT.

00:56:42.633 --> 00:56:46.603 region:rollup2
THEIR WORKERS EXPERIENCE ON THE

00:56:44.835 --> 00:56:48.605 region:rollup2
JOB AS FAR AS I KNOW THERE IS

00:56:46.603 --> 00:56:50.073 region:rollup2
ONE SURVEY THAT SADDAM WAS DONE

00:56:48.605 --> 00:56:51.875 region:rollup2
IN CHICAGO.

00:56:50.073 --> 00:56:53.510 region:rollup2
IN THAT SURVEY.

00:56:51.875 --> 00:56:54.978 region:rollup2
TOOK OUT.

00:56:53.510 --> 00:56:57.080 region:rollup2
LOOKED AT.

00:56:54.978 --> 00:56:59.016 region:rollup2
WHAT THE DATA WAS AND IT SAID

00:56:57.080 --> 00:57:00.717 region:rollup2
OVER THE COURSE OF THEM BEING

00:56:59.016 --> 00:57:02.886 region:rollup2
EMPLOYED FOR THEIR THEIR

00:57:00.717 --> 00:57:04.154 region:rollup2
INDUSTRY?

00:57:02.886 --> 00:57:06.990 region:rollup2
THEIR CAREER AS A HOUSEKEEPER.

00:57:04.154 --> 00:57:08.525 region:rollup2
HAD THEY THE QUESTION WAS SUCH

00:57:06.990 --> 00:57:10.494 region:rollup2
THAT IT WASN'T IN THE PAST YEAR

00:57:08.525 --> 00:57:12.963 region:rollup2
TWO WASN'T IN THE PAST TEN YEARS

00:57:10.494 --> 00:57:15.432 region:rollup2
IT WAS OVER THE COURSE OF THEIR

00:57:12.963 --> 00:57:17.134 region:rollup2
OF THEIR. CAREER AND SO THOSE

00:57:15.432 --> 00:57:18.168 region:rollup2
ARE THE NUMBERS THAT I NOW.

00:57:17.134 --> 00:57:19.903 region:rollup2
I'M SURE THAT THAT'S THE ONLY

00:57:18.168 --> 00:57:21.171 region:rollup2
THAT'S THE ONLY STUDY THAT I'M

00:57:19.903 --> 00:57:22.572 region:rollup2
AWARE OF THE INDUSTRIES THAT

00:57:21.171 --> 00:57:23.373 region:rollup2
EVER DONE A STUDY ON BEHALF OF

00:57:22.572 --> 00:57:25.075 region:rollup2
THE WORKERS THEY CARE SO MUCH

00:57:23.373 --> 00:57:26.076 region:rollup2
ABOUT. I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER

00:57:25.075 --> 00:57:27.844 region:rollup2
TO THAT I HAVE NEVER DONE A

00:57:26.076 --> 00:57:29.980 region:rollup2
STUDY ON IT I'M SURE THAT THERE

00:57:27.844 --> 00:57:32.049 region:rollup2
ARE. HOTEL SAFETY STANDARD AND

00:57:29.980 --> 00:57:32.916 region:rollup2
STUDIES OUT THERE SO OKAY YES I

00:57:32.049 --> 00:57:35.285 region:rollup2
WOULD SAY THEIR STUDIES I'M

00:57:32.916 --> 00:57:36.219 region:rollup2
UNAWARE I'M JUST GONNA SUGGEST.

00:57:35.285 --> 00:57:37.988 region:rollup2
THAT.

00:57:36.219 --> 00:57:39.690 region:rollup2
IN PARTICULAR.

00:57:37.988 --> 00:57:40.624 region:rollup2
THE HOTEL INDUSTRY HAS BEEN

00:57:39.690 --> 00:57:41.992 region:rollup2
VERY DISMISSIVE AND I THOUGHT

00:57:40.624 --> 00:57:44.127 region:rollup2
THE COMMENTS TO BE HONEST WERE

00:57:41.992 --> 00:57:45.829 region:rollup2
VERY DISMISSIVE TODAY AND I WAS

00:57:44.127 --> 00:57:47.931 region:rollup2
SOMEWHAT OFFENDED BY SOME OF THE

00:57:45.829 --> 00:57:49.499 region:rollup2
COMMENTS MADE. OUTRIGHT WITH

00:57:47.931 --> 00:57:50.567 region:rollup2
SOME BEING I'M VERY.

00:57:49.499 --> 00:57:52.369 region:rollup2
IT AND PERHAPS IT WAS IT.

00:57:50.567 --> 00:57:54.871 region:rollup2
NOT.

00:57:52.369 --> 00:57:56.273 region:rollup2
ON PURPOSE BUT LIKE EVEN TO SAY

00:57:54.871 --> 00:57:58.141 region:rollup2
WHAT IS A MAN TO DO WHEN HIS

00:57:56.273 --> 00:58:00.110 region:rollup2
WIFE MAKES A HOTEL RESERVATION

00:57:58.141 --> 00:58:00.977 region:rollup2
FOR HIM THAT JUST WE SHOULD

00:58:00.110 --> 00:58:02.245 region:rollup2
THINK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW

00:58:00.977 --> 00:58:03.313 region:rollup2
WE'RE PRESENTING THESE.

00:58:02.245 --> 00:58:03.981 region:rollup2
SITUATIONS OKAY.

00:58:03.313 --> 00:58:05.382 region:rollup2
.

00:58:03.981 --> 00:58:07.551 region:rollup2
AT.

00:58:05.382 --> 00:58:08.652 region:rollup2
NOW.

00:58:07.551 --> 00:58:09.453 region:rollup2
I'M ALMOST DONE HERE I'M

00:58:08.652 --> 00:58:11.488 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY SUPPORTING THIS BILL

00:58:09.453 --> 00:58:12.422 region:rollup2
I'M.

00:58:11.488 --> 00:58:13.223 region:rollup2
I THINK IF THE INDUSTRY WERE

00:58:12.422 --> 00:58:14.825 region:rollup2
SERIOUS.

00:58:13.223 --> 00:58:16.493 region:rollup2
THAT.

00:58:14.825 --> 00:58:17.928 region:rollup2
THEY WOULD TAKE A LOOK AFTER ALL

00:58:16.493 --> 00:58:19.229 region:rollup2
THE STORIES ARE OUT THERE AFTER

00:58:17.928 --> 00:58:21.098 region:rollup2
LOOK THE MOST FAMOUS WHAT WAS

00:58:19.229 --> 00:58:23.867 region:rollup2
THAT THE IMF HAD TO YOU KNOW

00:58:21.098 --> 00:58:25.335 region:rollup2
RATE OF MADE RIGHT WE KNOW THESE

00:58:23.867 --> 00:58:27.137 region:rollup2
THINGS HAVE EXISTED FOR AWHILE.

00:58:25.335 --> 00:58:27.971 region:rollup2
IN BECAUSE I'M NOT I'M NOT

00:58:27.137 --> 00:58:29.973 region:rollup2
CERTAIN.

00:58:27.971 --> 00:58:31.308 region:rollup2
THAT EVEN OUR MOST RESPONSIBLE

00:58:29.973 --> 00:58:33.010 region:rollup2
ACTORS IN THE INDUSTRY THE

00:58:31.308 --> 00:58:34.111 region:rollup2
UNIONIZED ACTORS ARE DOING

00:58:33.010 --> 00:58:35.846 region:rollup2
ENOUGH WE KNOW THAT THOSE WHO

00:58:34.111 --> 00:58:37.214 region:rollup2
DON'T HAVE.

00:58:35.846 --> 00:58:38.949 region:rollup2
WORKER PROTECTIONS PUT IN PLACE

00:58:37.214 --> 00:58:40.150 region:rollup2
OR DEMANDED BY THE UNION REALLY

00:58:38.949 --> 00:58:41.852 region:rollup2
AREN'T DOING ANYTHING OR IT

00:58:40.150 --> 00:58:43.019 region:rollup2
THERE'S NO THERE'S NO REASON TO

00:58:41.852 --> 00:58:44.187 region:rollup2
BELIEVE THAT THERE'S ANYTHING

00:58:43.019 --> 00:58:45.922 region:rollup2
BEING DONE TO PROTECT BOTTOM

00:58:44.187 --> 00:58:47.557 region:rollup2
HOUSEKEEPERS IN PARTICULAR. AND

00:58:45.922 --> 00:58:48.959 region:rollup2
I THINK IT'S SHOCKING THAT GIVEN

00:58:47.557 --> 00:58:50.193 region:rollup2
HOW LONG THIS HAS BEEN IN THE

00:58:48.959 --> 00:58:52.028 region:rollup2
NEWS THAT NOTHING.

00:58:50.193 --> 00:58:53.697 region:rollup2
I'M NOT SIGNING ANY KIND OF

00:58:52.028 --> 00:58:55.332 region:rollup2
COMFORT AND WHAT'S BEEN OFFERED

00:58:53.697 --> 00:58:57.000 region:rollup2
SO I'M I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THE

00:58:55.332 --> 00:58:58.235 region:rollup2
BLACKLIST NOT THAT CONCERNED I'M

00:58:57.000 --> 00:58:59.603 region:rollup2
TO BE HONEST BECAUSE I DON'T

00:58:58.235 --> 00:59:01.671 region:rollup2
THINK YOU'RE GONNA HAVE

00:58:59.603 --> 00:59:03.373 region:rollup2
REPORTING OF PEOPLE I'M.

00:59:01.671 --> 00:59:04.908 region:rollup2
AND INTENTIONALLY OR WRONGLY

00:59:03.373 --> 00:59:06.109 region:rollup2
THAT DIDN'T DO SOMETHING WRONG

00:59:04.908 --> 00:59:07.644 region:rollup2
BUT I GET WE HAVE TO WORK ON THE

00:59:06.109 --> 00:59:08.412 region:rollup2
DUE PROCESS ASPECT IN THE NEXT

00:59:07.644 --> 00:59:09.379 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE WHICH HOPEFULLY I'LL

00:59:08.412 --> 00:59:10.514 region:rollup2
BE SITTING ON.

00:59:09.379 --> 00:59:12.215 region:rollup2
BUT I WOULD TELL THE INDUSTRY

00:59:10.514 --> 00:59:13.283 region:rollup2
THAT IF YOU'RE SERIOUS ABOUT NOT

00:59:12.215 --> 00:59:14.985 region:rollup2
FACING A BILL LIKE THIS WHETHER

00:59:13.283 --> 00:59:17.621 region:rollup2
THAT'S GETS THROUGH THIS YEAR OR

00:59:14.985 --> 00:59:18.989 region:rollup2

MAY WANT TO NUMBER ONE. DO A

00:59:18.989 --> 00:59:21.291 region:rollup2
SURVEY OF YOUR OWN WORKERS AND

MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY

SAFE MOST OF YOUR WORKFORCE ARE

00:59:23.760 --> 00:59:26.496 region:rollup2
A LARGE PART OF YOUR WATCHER

FEEL AS COMFORTABLE COMING

00:59:29.533 --> 00:59:33.470 region:rollup2

WHAT SHOULD BE HAPPENING HERE IN

00:59:37.908 --> 00:59:41.912 region:rollup2
THIS BILL AND I THINK THAT THE

00:59:39.576 --> 00:59:43.080 region:rollup2
NUMBER ONE CONCERN IF  WE WERE

00:59:41.912 --> 00:59:44.548 region:rollup2
IN A DIFFERENT INDUSTRY SHOULD

00:59:43.080 --> 00:59:46.716 region:rollup2

DRAMATICALLY.

01:00:59.222 --> 01:01:03.326 region:rollup2
.

01:01:01.625 --> 01:01:03.894 region:rollup2
THAT INDIVIDUAL NOT ONLY WAS

01:01:03.326 --> 01:01:05.729 region:rollup2
FIRED BUT WE WE TURNED THEM

01:01:03.894 --> 01:01:06.997 region:rollup2

.

01:01:09.432 --> 01:01:13.169 region:rollup2
AND I I JUST HOPE.

01:01:11.735 --> 01:01:15.338 region:rollup2
HE GETS ALL THAT HE DESERVED

01:01:13.169 --> 01:01:17.908 region:rollup2

I I DON'T SEE THAT BEING A

01:01:40.697 --> 01:01:41.565 region:rollup2
PROBLEM MAYBE OTHER THAN

01:01:41.198 --> 01:01:43.967 region:rollup2

TECHNOLOGY DEPRESSED PROTECT

01:02:14.331 --> 01:02:18.501 region:rollup2
THESE WORKERS IN WAYS THAT I

01:02:16.766 --> 01:02:20.070 region:rollup2
THINK WE ALSO SHOULD TAKE THAT

01:02:18.501 --> 01:02:21.338 region:rollup2
EXTRA STEP. SO THAT THEY CAN

01:02:20.070 --> 01:02:22.672 region:rollup2

AND.

01:02:25.041 --> 01:02:29.245 region:rollup2
MIKE MY COLLEAGUE TO LEFT AND I.

01:02:26.876 --> 01:02:30.880 region:rollup2

01:02:32.716 --> 01:02:39.656 region:rollup2
SEVERAL AND HOTEL SANTA.

01:02:36.620 --> 01:02:41.057 region:rollup2
TWO THOUSAND TWELVE. IT.

01:02:39.656 --> 01:02:42.525 region:rollup2
AND ARE I KNOW THERE'S BEEN

01:02:41.057 --> 01:02:45.028 region:rollup2
TIMES WHERE.

01:02:42.525 --> 01:02:47.130 region:rollup2
SIMULTANEOUSLY.

01:02:45.028 --> 01:02:47.664 region:rollup2
I'VE COMMODITY SHOWER AT THE

01:02:47.130 --> 01:02:49.099 region:rollup2
SAME TIME SOME OF THE BEEN

01:02:47.664 --> 01:02:50.433 region:rollup2
KNOCKING.

01:02:49.099 --> 01:02:52.769 region:rollup2
AND THEY'VE COME TO THE DOOR.

01:02:50.433 --> 01:02:54.404 region:rollup2
BUT LUCKILY.

01:02:52.769 --> 01:02:56.940 region:rollup2
I'D IN EXPOSED LIFE OF.

01:02:54.404 --> 01:02:58.508 region:rollup2
SO MY CONCERN IS IF I.

01:02:56.940 --> 01:02:59.809 region:rollup2
HAD NOT HEARD SOMETHING A MY

01:02:58.508 --> 01:03:01.745 region:rollup2
SPIDER SENSE DIDN'T SAY

01:02:59.809 --> 01:03:03.079 region:rollup2
SOMEBODY'S.

01:03:01.745 --> 01:03:05.382 region:rollup2
IN HERE I NEED TO STOP AND LOOK

01:03:03.079 --> 01:03:06.583 region:rollup2
OUT.

01:03:05.382 --> 01:03:08.985 region:rollup2
THAT THAT COULD HAVE TURNED INTO

01:03:06.583 --> 01:03:10.887 region:rollup2
A SITUATION WHERE THEY'VE GONE.

01:03:08.985 --> 01:03:12.155 region:rollup2
TO YOUR MANAGEMENT.

01:03:10.887 --> 01:03:13.123 region:rollup2
IN SAID THAT I HAD BEEN

01:03:12.155 --> 01:03:17.494 region:rollup2
INAPPROPRIATE AND WITHOUT DUE

01:03:13.123 --> 01:03:19.929 region:rollup2
PROCESS.

01:03:17.494 --> 01:03:21.197 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY THE ELECTED OFFICIAL.

01:03:19.929 --> 01:03:21.965 region:rollup2
THAT COULD BE NOT ONLY

01:03:21.197 --> 01:03:23.466 region:rollup2
EMBARRASSING BUT IT COULD BE

01:03:21.965 --> 01:03:23.633 region:rollup2
CAREER ENDING.

01:03:23.466 --> 01:03:25.435 region:rollup2
AND.

01:03:23.633 --> 01:03:27.470 region:rollup2
.

01:03:25.435 --> 01:03:28.705 region:rollup2
SO I I THINK WE ALSO NEED GO

01:03:27.470 --> 01:03:30.674 region:rollup2
FROM IN A JUDICIARY SIDE. TO

01:03:28.705 --> 01:03:31.775 region:rollup2

PREDATORS.

01:03:34.344 --> 01:03:37.147 region:rollup2

01:03:35.478 --> 01:03:39.716 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS.

01:03:37.147 --> 01:03:42.152 region:rollup2
WHO HAVE MADE AN HONEST MISTAKE?

01:03:39.716 --> 01:03:44.621 region:rollup2

01:05:31.127 --> 01:05:34.097 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR SITUATION.

BILL IS ABOUT TO PROCESS.

01:05:45.408 --> 01:05:48.378 region:rollup2
EVERYTHING IN THE LAST YEAR AND

01:05:46.743 --> 01:05:49.479 region:rollup2
A HALF THAT BEEN HERE HAS BEEN

01:05:48.378 --> 01:05:50.613 region:rollup2
DUE PROCESS AND ON THIS

01:05:49.479 --> 01:05:52.582 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR ISSUE.

01:05:50.613 --> 01:05:53.450 region:rollup2
THERE IS NONE.

01:05:52.582 --> 01:05:54.083 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S A HUGE CONCERN OF

01:05:53.450 --> 01:05:55.785 region:rollup2
MINE.

01:05:54.083 --> 01:05:56.619 region:rollup2
BECAUSE.

01:05:55.785 --> 01:05:58.855 region:rollup2
WE DON'T WANNA PROTECT ABOUT

01:05:56.619 --> 01:06:00.690 region:rollup2
ACTORS WE ABSOLUTELY DO NOT AND

01:05:58.855 --> 01:06:02.025 region:rollup2
IF IF THEY'VE BEEN.

01:06:00.690 --> 01:06:03.026 region:rollup2
THREE NIGHTS THREE OUT OF THREE

01:06:02.025 --> 01:06:04.794 region:rollup2
NIGHTS AT THEIR STAND AND

01:06:03.026 --> 01:06:06.229 region:rollup2
THEY'VE HAD THIS ISSUE. I WAS

01:06:04.794 --> 01:06:07.730 region:rollup2
HOPE THE GENERAL MANAGER HAD ME

01:06:06.229 --> 01:06:09.098 region:rollup2
TO THAT OF WHAT CALL NINE ONE

01:06:07.730 --> 01:06:11.100 region:rollup2
ONE STATE IN THE LEFT AND THE

01:06:09.098 --> 01:06:12.402 region:rollup2
PATRON TELETYPE'S HIS SIDE OF

01:06:11.100 --> 01:06:14.137 region:rollup2
THE STORE AND LET THEM DEAL WITH

01:06:12.402 --> 01:06:15.572 region:rollup2
IT AT A LAW ENFORCEMENT DOWNSIDE

01:06:14.137 --> 01:06:16.773 region:rollup2
OF THIS THING.

01:06:15.572 --> 01:06:18.074 region:rollup2
I JUST HAVE A TREMENDOUS CONCERN

01:06:16.773 --> 01:06:19.108 region:rollup2
IT COULD EVEN ON THE ETHNIC SIDE

01:06:18.074 --> 01:06:20.543 region:rollup2
OF THIS THERE'S SOME OF OUR

01:06:19.108 --> 01:06:22.479 region:rollup2
CULTURES WITHIN OUR COMMUNITIES

01:06:20.543 --> 01:06:24.214 region:rollup2
THAT HAVE A LOT THE SAME NAMES.

01:06:22.479 --> 01:06:25.648 region:rollup2
AND SO AS WE GO THROUGH THIS AND

01:06:24.214 --> 01:06:27.317 region:rollup2
AND WHETHER IT'S JOHN SMITH OR

01:06:25.648 --> 01:06:29.118 region:rollup2
WHOEVER THAT MAY BE. THERE'S A

01:06:27.317 --> 01:06:30.153 region:rollup2
LOT OF THOSE OUT THERE.

01:06:29.118 --> 01:06:32.222 region:rollup2
THERE'S NOT A LOT OF HE'S OUT

01:06:30.153 --> 01:06:33.423 region:rollup2
THERE ALBEIT BUT THERE'S A LOT

01:06:32.222 --> 01:06:34.791 region:rollup2
OF CULTURES THAT USE THE SAME

01:06:33.423 --> 01:06:36.693 region:rollup2
NAME SO THIS IS ONE OF MY

01:06:34.791 --> 01:06:38.628 region:rollup2
CONCERNS WITH THIS BILL. IS WE

01:06:36.693 --> 01:06:40.530 region:rollup2
HAVE TO FIX THAT PROCESS.

01:06:38.628 --> 01:06:41.898 region:rollup2
AND I THINK QUITE FRANKLY THAT

01:06:40.530 --> 01:06:43.199 region:rollup2
THERE IS A SOLUTION BETWEEN.

01:06:41.898 --> 01:06:44.501 region:rollup2
THE FOLKS WE NEED TO BE

01:06:43.199 --> 01:06:45.902 region:rollup2
PROTECTED AND THE INDUSTRY

01:06:44.501 --> 01:06:47.103 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THIS IS I DON'T THINK

01:06:45.902 --> 01:06:48.471 region:rollup2
THE INDUSTRY IS SAYING THAT ALL

01:06:47.103 --> 01:06:49.772 region:rollup2
THAT WE DON'T PROTECT OUR POLICE

01:06:48.471 --> 01:06:50.807 region:rollup2
THEY'RE NOT SAYING THAT. WHAT

01:06:49.772 --> 01:06:52.208 region:rollup2
THEY ARE SAYING IS THERE ARE

01:06:50.807 --> 01:06:54.444 region:rollup2
SOME VERY BIG CONCERNS BECAUSE I

01:06:52.208 --> 01:06:55.078 region:rollup2
DO THINK THE INDUSTRY HAS A?

01:06:54.444 --> 01:06:56.012 region:rollup2
RIGHT TO PROTECT THE PATRONS AS

01:06:55.078 --> 01:06:57.514 region:rollup2
WELL.

01:06:56.012 --> 01:06:59.282 region:rollup2
BECAUSE FOR THIS DUE PROCESS

01:06:57.514 --> 01:07:00.984 region:rollup2
ASPECT OF THIS PARTICULAR BILL

01:06:59.282 --> 01:07:02.185 region:rollup2
SO I'M I'M SORRY I CANNOT

01:07:00.984 --> 01:07:03.853 region:rollup2
SUPPORT THIS BILL TODAY BUT I DO

01:07:02.185 --> 01:07:05.488 region:rollup2
NOT WANT IT TO BE THAT I DON'T

01:07:03.853 --> 01:07:07.290 region:rollup2
PROTECT WORKERS. BUT IF WE COULD

01:07:05.488 --> 01:07:08.791 region:rollup2
FIX THOSE TWO PARTS OF THIS BILL

01:07:07.290 --> 01:07:10.293 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THAT THE PANIC BUT

01:07:08.791 --> 01:07:11.494 region:rollup2
IS ACTUALLY EASILY. I'M NOT IS

01:07:10.293 --> 01:07:12.695 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY SOMETHING THAT COULD

01:07:11.494 --> 01:07:14.864 region:rollup2
COULD EASILY BE DONE.

01:07:12.695 --> 01:07:16.633 region:rollup2
BUT THAT DUE PROCESS IS A

01:07:14.864 --> 01:07:17.767 region:rollup2

01:13:55.564 --> 01:13:58.668 region:rollup2
I I GUESS THE ONLY OTHER THING

01:13:57.533 --> 01:14:00.369 region:rollup2
THAT I WOULD ADD. NOT WANTING TO

IT SEEMS TO ME.

01:14:08.511 --> 01:14:11.113 region:rollup2
THERE IS AN INHERENT POWER

01:14:09.478 --> 01:14:13.149 region:rollup2

EVEN NOW.

01:14:21.223 --> 01:14:23.859 region:rollup2
AND THAT IT IS VERY RISKY AND

01:14:22.825 --> 01:14:25.428 region:rollup2
DANGEROUS.

01:14:23.859 --> 01:14:26.962 region:rollup2
FOR.

01:14:25.428 --> 01:14:28.597 region:rollup2

TO MAKE A COMPLAINT

01:14:28.597 --> 01:14:31.233 region:rollup2
AGAINST A GUEST.

01:14:30.266 --> 01:14:31.767 region:rollup2
THAT COULD EASILY BE BALLOTS

01:14:31.233 --> 01:14:33.069 region:rollup2

AGAINST THE WORKER.

01:14:36.872 --> 01:14:41.777 region:rollup2

MAKE YOU SEE. OR SAY LET US TAKE

01:14:48.718 --> 01:14:51.821 region:rollup2
