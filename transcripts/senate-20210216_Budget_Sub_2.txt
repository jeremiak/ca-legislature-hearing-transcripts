J. SMALL GRANTS PROGRAM- THIS IS BEEN GOING FULL I'M A NUMBER IF HE IS. AND IT REALLY DOES CRITICALLY IMPORTANT WORK TO EMPOWER COMMUNITIES WORKING ON A WIDE VARIETY OF SOLUTIONS TO SOME OF OUR TOUGHEST ENVIRONMENTAL CHALLENGES IT SINGULARLY FOCUSED ON FUNDING PROJECTS THAT MAKE THE BIGGEST DIFFERENCE A SMALL AMOUNT OF MONEY AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. AND THROUGHOUT THIS INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT YEAR HAVE IT NINETEEN THE MONSTER THE FUNDING HAS ONLY INCREASED IN TWENTY TWENTY ELEVEN THE PROGRAM APPLICANTS REQUESTED FULL MILLION AND GRANDSON'S FAMILY ONE POINT FIVE MILLION IN AVAILABLE FUNDS THE GROUNDS AWARDED LAST YEAR FUNDED CHAD THINGS LIKE IMPLEMENTING NEW CHEMICAL EXPOSURE ENCODED NINETEEN SAFETY MEASURES THE NAIL SALON WORKERS. ENGAGING HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS ACROSS CONTRA COSTA COUNTY AND CLIMATE ACTION PLANNING WE FUNDED GROUPS IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY AND ELSEWHERE THE SUPPORT FORMERLY INCARCERATED PEOPLE TO TRANSITION INTO WORKING IN THE COMMUNITY GARDENS AND INSTALLING COMMUNITY BASED INFRASTRUCTURE AND WE FIND THAT CUTTING EDGE RESEARCH EXAMINING BASS AND MATERNAL HEALTH OUTCOMES AFFECTING BLACK MOTHERS AND FAMILIES IN FRESNO AND AT A TIME WHEN OUR FRONT LINE WORK IS SHOWN HOW CRITICALLY ESSENTIAL. AND VULNERABLE THEY CAN BE WITH ALL IS THAT FUNDED THE- LED ORGANIZED. TO ALL HEALTH NOW THAT'S INTO. IS THE SAME AS NON ENGLISH. INDIGENOUS OUT FEET INCLUDE SPEAK. FIELD LAB AND THAT ARE JUST. A FEW IS. OF THE EXAM- IT'S IS ONE OF THESE PROGRAMS IT'S KIND OF BEEN. KICKED AROUND FROM FUNDING SOURCE THE FUNDING SOURCE OVER THE YEARS- IT COULD BE REALLY BUT WHEN I TALK TO PEOPLE. ABOUT EQUITY CLIMB ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE IS THE FIRST THING I GENERALLY TALK ABOUT BECAUSE- IT HAD A REALLY FOCUSES ON THE NEEDS OF COMMUNITIES RATHER THAN WHAT WE THINK THE NEEDS OF COMMUNITIES ARE- AND IT. IS ORIGINALLY WAS FUNDED FROM. A WHOLE HOST OF DIFFERENT- SOURCES PENALTY ACCOUNTS FROM WASTEWATER DISCHARGE ACCOUNT- POLLUTION CONTROL FIND. AND SOME SUPPLEMENTAL ENVIRONMENTAL PROJECTS- TOSCA AND BEVERAGE CONTAINER RECYCLING FUNDS OF ALSO. OVER TIME IN A LIMITED WAY SUPPORTED THIS PROGRAM SO. IDEALLY WE DO WANT TO USE IT FOR PENALTY FOR THIS PROGRAM AGAIN. BY IN LIGHT OF CURRENT THEM MONSIVAIS THE EVOLUTION CONTROL WASTEWATER DISCHARGE FUNDS TO FILL BUDGET FOR CHOKEHOLDS THOSE ACCOUNTS WERE NOT FEASIBLE. IN THIS BUDGET CYCLE SO- AND WE HAVE TO COME THE FINAL TO DEFRAY THIS OUT OF WELL AS HELPFUL SO AG SAYING. THAT WE WANT THAT ONE FIVE MILLION DOLLAR TO COME TOUGH- TO THIS YEAR AT A MINIMUM INTO WAY ABLE TO SECURE IT IT TENTATIVE FUNDING SOURCE. AND THAT'S HOPEFULLY MORE CONTINUOUS AND HOPEFULLY IS A VIABLE- OPTION TO KEEPING THE PROGRAM GOING- I WANT TO GROW THE PROGRAM I THINK. THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND CALIBRATION BE DOING. I'M SO WITH WITH VERY. I AM VERY INTENT ON ANYTHING I CAN DO TO PARTNER WITH ANY OF YOU ON THIS COMMITTEE TO THINK ABOUT HOW TO STRENGTHEN THE PROGRAM. GROW IT- IT IT MEETS AN INCREDIBLE NEED AND EVERY SINGLE PROJECT IS FUNDED I READ THROUGH ALL OF THEM- I JUST ONE DAY LIKE WOW THIS IS MATERIALLY SHAKING. OUT COMMUNITIES FOR THE BETTER SO- THE PROPOSAL IN FRONT OF YOU THAT IS. ONE POINT FIVE MILLION APPROPRIATION FOR THIS YEAR TO COME OUT OF PASTA. THANK YOU- LMAO YOU READ THE STAFF REPORT THE STAFF REPORT TALKS ABOUT YOU KNOW THIS IS THESE ARE GREAT PROGRAMS LET'S STIPULATE WHAT THE SECRETARY THAT THERE THE CJ- PROGRAMS ARE GOOD. BUT SOME OF THAT IS TOXIC. HARM BUT SOME OF IT AIR POLLUTION HARM SOME OF CAN GO FOR COME FROM BEVERAGE. SOME ITS WAYS WATER IS SUPPORT FOR ALL OF SOURCES THAT AFFECT THESE COMMUNITIES. AND THIS PROPOSAL IS K. IS TAKING IT OFF FROM THE TOSCA ACCOUNT. CAN YOU. COMMENT ON THAT AND GIVE ME YOUR INSIDES. YEAH GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN BIRDS ROSS BROWN WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE- YOU'RE RIGHT- MISTER SHARON AS A SECRETARY MENTIONS- THERE IN THE PAST THERE HAVE BEEN KIND OF A VARIETY OF. A SPECIAL FUNDS THAT HAVE BEEN USED TO SUPPORT THESE ACTIVITIES- THIS PROPOSAL HERE WITH- WOULD USE JUST THE TOSCA FUND RATHER THAN THE NEXUS SPECIAL FUNDS IN THE PAST. BUT WE DO THINK KIND OF EXPLORING- USING SOME MIX OF SPECIAL FUNDS. AS IS DONE BEEN DONE IN THE PAST AS IT IS. AN ALTERNATIVE WORTH EXPLORING THAT WOULD- MORE CLOSELY MATCH SORT OF THE MIX OF ACTIVITIES THAT ARE FUNDED HERE WHAT'S THE FUNDING SOURCES- AND THAT'S BOTH KIND OF IF THE LEGISLATURE APPROVES THE- DGSE REFORM. PROPOSAL THAT'S IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET WHICH IS- IN THIS PROPOSAL WOULD BE CONTINGENT ON THAT. OR IF IT DOESN'T WE DO THINK YOU KNOW KIND OF EXPLORING SOME OF THOSE- ALTERNATIVES ARE WORTHWHILE. AND WE'RE HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOU AND YOUR STAFF IS THAT SOMETHING THAT YOU'RE INTERESTED IN DOING AND WORKING WITH THE ADMINISTRATION TO EXPLORE WHAT'S POSSIBLE THERE. YEAH THE CHAIR HAS A BILL TO INCREASE THE FUNDS ON THE- DGSE AND THE THAT. TOXIC AND HAZARDOUS WASTE WE HAVE MORE THAN JUST A PASSING INTEREST I GUESS THE QUESTION IS THAT. YOU KNOW WE IF THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN AND I'D LIKE TO BE. SUCCESSFUL EVERYBODY WANTS TO BE SUCCESSFUL AND THERE'S A NEED TO IT IF IT DOESN'T WE'RE WE GET TO BE ACTIVE WE HAVE. ALL THE- ALL THE FUNDING. IN THE ANTICIPATED- I TEXAS OF CONTROL. ARE WAS THERE A HAND UP. FINANCE ONE OF YOU WEIGH IN HERE WE'VE GOT WE'VE GOT A WHOLE GROUP OF VIA. THE SOCIAL ILLS PROGRAMS THAT ARE CONTRIBUTING A LITTLE BIT TO KEEP THESE EACH A- THINGS OFF WE ARE. HOPEFUL THAT WE GET A TWO THIRDS VOTE BILL TO REFORM THE TSC FROM FEES BUT- IS THERE A MORE. IT IS WHAT DO YOU SAY ABOUT OUR STAFF COMMENTS ON THIS. HI GOOD MORNING CHAIR LIZZY ARE YOU DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I'M SO WE DO RECOGNIZE WE HAVE UTILIZED AVAILABLE PENALTY REVENUES FROM VARIOUS FUNDING SOURCES TO MEET THIS DEMAND BUT AS THE SECRETARY NOTED.

UNSTABLE POTENTIALLY PENALTY REVENUES ON A YEAR TO YEAR BASIS NIGHT THIS PROPOSAL INSTEAD WILL USE ARE YOU- TOSCA ENVIRONMENTAL FEE REVENUES TO PROVIDE A SUSTAINABLE AND ONGOING I'M SOURCES FOR THE PROGRAM. I'M KIND OF CRAZY HOT NOTED THAT THE PROPOSAL IS CONTINGENT ON THE PASSAGE OF THE GOVERNANCE AND REFORM BUT WE BELIEVE. SUSTAINABLE FINDINGS FOR THIS PROGRAM. WELL I KNOW FOR ME KICK ASK INTO BECAUSE I KNOW A LOT OF LIKE THE AB SIX ONE SEVEN. HI E. J.

TO COMPLEMENT WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR THESE OTHER AGENCIES YOU TELLING THIS COMMITTEE THAT THERE'S NO MONEY AVAILABLE FROM THESE AIR POLLUTION SETTLEMENTS. NOW WHAT AND WE DO RECOGNIZE THAT THESE SUPPLEMENTS FUNDING HAD SETTLEMENTS TO PROVIDE FUNDING INTO POTENTIALLY BEAVAILABLE AND ARE. WEARING BLACK AT ARTICLES LIKE THIS POINT IS TO UTILIZED MONEY FROM. OKAY CENTRESTAGE HAVE A QUESTION I DON'T SEE HAND UP I SEE OR HEAR. FIVE OTHERWISE THIS IS WE'RE GONNA HOLD THIS MATTER- OBVIOUSLY WE HAVE SOME OTHER QUESTIONS THAT WE LIKE TO FOLLOW UP WITH THAT AND- THIS IS THAT'LL CONCLUDE THAT THIS PUT THAT PORTION OF ISSUE NUMBER THIRTEEN. LET'S ESTABLISH A QUORUM OF MISS RIGHT CAN YOU PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. WHY CASKEY HERE KASKY HERE DOLLY. DOLLY HERE MCGUIRE HERE MCGUIRE HERE STERN. I'M HERE AT THE CENTER SIR DO YOU HAVE ANY STAFF WITH YOU IN THE ROOM OR IN YOUR OFFICE. MORNING DISTANTLY AWAY FEW OFFICES WHERE JEREMY WOLFE MY DISTRICT DIRECTOR BUT I'M- JUST ME THANK YOU FOR THAT OKAY I DID AND I DID HAVE A COMMON ON THE TASK ITEM BUT- YOU CAN- RESERVISTS YOU MISTER CHAIR AT. OKAY THANK YOU- LET'S IMPORTATION OF A FOURTEEN THIS IS OUR OVERSIGHT HEARING AYE CAPTAIN TREES WE HAVE. OF FOR DISTINGUISHED PANELISTS READ THE HAVE THEM INTRODUCE THEM YOU CAN GO ON THE WEBSITE READ ABOUT THEM LET'S START OFF WITH. THE LEGISLATURE'S OWN ANALYSTS OFFICE MISTER BROWN. YOU CAN BEGIN. WELCOME CARE RANDOLPH THEN A SECTOR BLUMENFELD AND- PROFESSOR CALLING WOULD ALSO. THANK YOU AGAIN MR SHERIDAN ROSS BROWN WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE- I DO AN ESTATE UP FRONT I'M NOT- AND A NON VOTING MEMBER OF THE INDEPENDENT EMISSIONS MARKET ADVISORY COMMITTEE WHAT SHE'LL HERE- MAYBE A LITTLE BIT ABOUT LATER ON- BUT I WILL BE SPEAKING THIS MORNNG OF COURSE IN MY ROLE AS- AN ANALYST FOR LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE SINISTER STOP SO AS TO. MAKE THAT CLEAR I'M SO SORRY I KNOW WE CAN WE HAVE A LOT WHAT IF YOUR PANEL LESSONS ALL TRY TO BE BRIEF WITH MY COMMENTS I JUST WANT TO KIND OF MAKE A FEW I LEVEL COMMENTS FIRST I THINK IMPORTANT FOR THIS CONVERSATION IS JUST A LITTLE CONTEXT FOR THE STATE'S GREENHOUSE GAS GOALS AND- WHERE WE'VE BEEN WHERE WE ARE AND- WHERE WE'RE GOING WHAT THEIR GOALS ARE- IN PARTICULAR THE- AMBITIOUS NATURE OF THE TWENTY THIRTY GREENHOUSE GAS GOALS SO JUST FOR CONTEXT. THE STATE HAS NOT IT'S TWENTY TWENTY GREENHOUSE GAS SCHOOLS A FEW YEARS EARLY- AND THAT'S A THAT'S A GREAT SUCCESS- BUT I THINK JUST FOR CONTEXT AGAIN THE ANNUAL EMISSION REDUCTIONS NEEDED TO MEET THE TWENTY TWENTY GOALS LAID OUT IN AB THIRTY TWO WERE ROUGHLY 1% REDUCTIONS IN EMISSIONS PER YEAR ANNUALLY- WHEREAS THE TO MEET THE TWENTY THIRTY GOAL IT'S CLOSER TO A FOUR PERCENT- ANNUAL. EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS NEEDED TO YOU TO MEET THAT GOAL SO- THAT THE GOALS ARE MUCH MORE AMBITIOUS KIND OF GOING UP TO TWENTY THIRTY AND I THINK THE- ONE OF THE OF COURSE THE MOST IMPORTANT QUESTIONS IN ONE THAT YOU MIGHT EXPLORE IN THIS HEARING IS WHAT IS THE NEXT OF POLICIES THAT THE LEGISLATURE WANTS TO ADOPT IN ORDER TO. ACHIEVE THOSE AMBITIOUS GOALS- AS YOU KNOW THE STATE HAS A WIDE VARIETY OF- PROGRAMS- REGULATORY PROGRAMS INCENTIVE PROGRAMS AS WELL AS THE STATE'S. ECONOMY WIDE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM AND SO SORTING THROUGH SORT OF A MIX OF PROGRAMS THAT ARE THIS MONTH MOST LIKELY TO ACHIEVE THOSE GOALS AND ACHIEVE THOSE GOALS AFFECTED LEE IS VERY IMPORTANT- IN IN AND KIND OF THAT. THAT CONTEXT THINK- I ALSO WANTED TO KNOW. AS PART OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN SCOPING. THAT THE EVERY BOARD ADOPTED- IS A- THEIR A GROWING. ROLE I DON'T. FOR AND TRADE- TO MEET THE TWENTY THIRTY TARGETS- I DON'T. BASIS IN TWENTY THIRTY NEARLY HALF OF THE EMISSION REDUCTIONS WERE. IDENTIFIED TO COME FROM CAP AND TRAD- AND SO. AS AN OFFICE I FAILURE WE DO THINK- RELYING ON CARBON PRICING AND CAP AND TRADE IS A COST EFFECTIVE WAY TO. REDUCE EMISSIONS BUT THERE ARE NO THERE ARE JUSTIFICATIONS FOR OTHER PROGRAMS AS WELL AND SO WE THINK EXPLORING SORT OF THE MIX OF CAP AND TRADE VERSUS OTHER. POLICIES AND PROGRAMS IS AN IMPORTANT ROLE FOR THE LEGISLATURE AND I'M SURE THAT WILL BE PART OF THIS HEARING- SO I THE SECOND POINT I WANT TO GET TO IS YOUR WHATEVER THE LEGISLATURE DECIDES ON WHAT. ROLE IT WOULD LIKE TO SEE COUNTRY PLAY GOING FORWARD- JUST HAVING THE PROGRAM IN PLACE IS NOT. NOT SUFFICIENT TO ENSURE THE PROGRAMS ACHIEVING THE GOALS OF THE LEGISLATURE HOUSE WHERE OF THE STATE HAS FOR IT SO- IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROGRAM THE DESIGN OF THE PROGRAM. MATTERS A LOT INSTEAD I GETS TO THE SECOND POINT THERE'S A LOT OF- A LOT OF IMPORTANT DESIGN DECISIONS AROUND BUT CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM AND HOW YOU'D LIKE TO HAVE IT STRUCTURED- I'M GONNA HIGHLIGHT. ONE IN PARTICULAR AT ONE THAT HAS AN ISSUE THAT HAS BEEN AROUND FOR. A FEW YEARS ESSENTIALLY SINCE THE EXTENSION IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN THROUGH AB THREE NINETY EIGHT SWITCHES THE- OF THE OVERALL SUPPLY OF ALLOWANCES THAT ARE OUT ON THE MARKET AND WHAT'S KNOWN AS SORT OF A BANK OF ALLOWANCES- AT. AS MANY OF YOU KNOW ALLOWANCES CAN BE KIND OF THAT ARE USED IN THE PRIOR YEAR CAN BE HELD ONTO AND BANKS AND USE FOR COMPLIANCE IN THE FUTURE YEAR. AND THERE'S A LOT OF GOOD REASONS TO HAVE THAT DESIGN FEATURE IN THE PROGRAM BUT AS RESULTS- IF EMISSIONS ARE LOWER THAN THE NUMBER OF ALLOWANCES THAT ARE OUT THERE IN THE INITIAL YEARS OF THE PROGRAM YOU CAN HAVE A SITUATION. WHERE THERE'S A LARGE NUMBER OF ALLOWANCES THAT ARE YOUR AVAILABLE TO USED. AND YEAR. AND PA. THAT WHEN YOU GET OUT I. LATER OUT THIRTY LARGE. ALLOW COULD BE USED TO COMPLY WITH THE- THE PROGRAM AND AS RESULTS- THE STATE MIGHT NOT BE CLOSE TO IT- AND THERE'S JUST A MISSION TARGETS OUT TO TWENTY THIRTY. SO I'M HAPPY TO KIND OF EXPLORE THAT ISSUE IN A LITTLE BIT MORE DETAIL BUT I JUST WANT TO SORT OF WHY GET AS ONE KIND OF. VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE AS IT RELATES TO SORT OF THE STRINGENCY OF THE PROGRAM. WHETHER OR NOT IT IS SET UP IN A WAY THAT- SUFFICIENT AND CONSISTENT WITH THE LEGISLATURES. OF GOALS OUT TO. OUT TO TWENTY THIRTY- AND SO I WILL KIND OF- MAYBE STOP MY COMMENTS JUST. HIGHLIGHTING THOSE COUPLE THINGS THERE- JUST AND ENDED BY SAYING- WE ARE HERE AS YOUR STAFF AND- HERE TO HELP YOU. SORT THROUGH SOME OF THESE BIG IMPORTANT QUESTIONS AROUND THE ROLE OF CAP AND TRADE AND IMPORTANT DESIGN FEATURES A PROGRAM- AND HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS OF WHERE YOU'RE GOING FORWARD. YOU KNOW MISTER BROWN- SECRETARY BLUMENFELD. INHERITED INHERITED THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM AS WELL AS- CHAIR RANDOLPH TO RANDOLPH IS COMING IN. APPROPRIATE LATE RIGHT AT THE TIME THAT AB THREE NINE EIGHT IS TAKING. THIS TAKING A AFFECT- I'D SO THEY WEREN'T AROUND- IN THE RULES AS AS THEY ARE TODAY. WHEN THE ENVIRONMENT CALL THE COMMITTEE WAS SIX EXPERIENCING THE HORROR CONSIDERING THE EXTENSION OF CAP AND TRADE AND- AND I. I LOSE SLEEP AT NIGHT. KNOWING THAT. WE WERE TOLD THAT WE COULDN'T AMEND THAT BILL WERE STAFF AND YOU IN PARTICULAR WERE SAYING THAT. THIS ALLOWANCE PROBLEM. WASN'T VERY BIG PROBLEM DON'T RULE OVER ALL THESE ALLOWANCES FROM THE- AB THIRTY TWO PROGRAM TO THE- AB THREE NINE A PROGRAM AND- THAT POLITICAL THIS. WAS MADE. AND NOW WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH THAT SO- COMING BACK TO YOU BUT- OF SECRETARY- BLUMENFELD GOOD MORNING ONCE AGAIN. GOOD MORNING JACK- BESTIVAL REALLY APPRECIATE- WHAT ROSS JUST SAID AND YOU'LL FOCUS ON THIS- OKAY ABOUT LOSING SLEEP AT NIGHT I'M I LIKELY DON'T LOSE SLEEP ATNIGHT THINKING ABOUT THAT PARTICULAR VOTE BY DELE SLEEP AT NIGHT THINKING ABOUT THE CLIMATE EMERGENCY AND- I AM A CRISIS THAT WAY AND I REALLY APPRECIATE YOU ALL. AND THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE FOCUS ON CLIMATE CHANGE- YEAH WE HAVE BASICALLY CAPS THE FOCUS. ON THIS CRITICAL ISSUE OF THE LAST FOUR YEARS BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS ABDICATED ITS RESPONSIBILITY AND I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU AT A PARTICULAR. THE OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY IT HELPS SHOP AND EVERYTHING THAT WE DO I'M AND YEAH ONCE AGAIN FOR THE RECORD MY NAME'S JERRY BLUMENFELD I'M THE SECRETARY OF AB CALLIE PA. I'M AND I ALSO WANT TO EXTEND A VERY WARM WELCOME TO CHAIR RANDOLPH I'M YOU'LL HEAR FROM NEXT- IN HER NEW ROLE AS YOU MENTIONED CHAD- SHE IS THE CHAIR OF THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD. HE'S GOT THAT COMMITMENT AND COMPASSION AND SMOCKS TO GET US EXACTLY WHERE ROSS DESCRIBED AS GOING WHICH IS A TWENTY THIRTY GOALS I JUST WANTED AS DIE I'M- J. Y. CASKEY WITH A BIT OF. HISTORY IS RUSTED AYE I WOULD MAKE SURE I'M NOT OVERLAPPING BUT REALLY JUST FOR THE PUBLIC TO UNDERSTAND. THAT CALIFORNIA IS PLAYING A GLOBAL LEADERSHIP ROLE WHEN IT COMES TO CLIMATE CHANGE I'VE NOT ONLY DO WE HAVE AMBITIOUS GOALS BUT WE HAVE AMBITIOUS ACTION. AND REALLY BEEN A POSITIVE FORCE FOR DRIVING ENHANCED EFFORTS BY NOT ONLY THE GOVERNMENTS AROUND THE WORLD BUT ALSO. THE U. S. GOVERNMENT HOPEFULLY AS I'LL AND ON WITH THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE BY DID MINISTRATION SO. AS WE HAD YOU HAD THE LEADERSHIP REALLY REQUIRES BOTH INTEGRATION AND TO BE COMPREHENSIVE NO SINGLE THING IS GOING TO SELL OUR CLIMATE PROBLEM THERE IS NO SILVER BULLET- ARE KIND OF PROGRAMS BUILDING A LONG HISTORY OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND INNOVATION ACROSS THE STATE. AND AS YOU HAD FOR ME THE FALL AND LITERALLY JUST BEFORE ON THE LAST ITEM THE ADMINISTRATION WILL CONTINUE TO ADVANCE. EQUITY AND ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE IN THIS CONTEXT. I BIPARTISAN AFFECTS BANDED MINISTRATIONS AND HAVE BENEFITTED FROM STRONG LEADERSHIP AND THREE GOVERNORS. ARE PARTNERS IN THE LEGISLATURE COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS THE NONPROFIT AND PRIVATE SECTORS. AND OUR REGULATORY AGENCIES. CALIFORNIA AND THIS REALLY THE MY IMPORTANT THING- J. Y. CASKEY KNOW THIS WE TALK TO. HIM I COUNTRY WHAT THEY TO KNOW. HOW IS CAL GROWN OUR ACCOUNT WHILE REDUCING EMISSIONS THE SAME TIME. THE CARBON INTENSITY OF CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY IS DECLINING. AND WE ARE AMONG THE MOST AMBITIOUS TARGETS IN THE WORLD AND EMPLOY MORE CALIFORNIANS. MORE CALIFORNIANS IN THE CLEAN ECONOMY THAN ANY OF THE STATE IN THE NATION. WE WILL ALSO DECOUPLED OUR EMISSIONS. I'M MISSIONS REDUCTIONS EFFORT SO WE GROWING THE ECONOMY WHICH IS GROWING BY TWENTY SIX PERCENT. BY REDUCING CARBON EMISSIONS BY THIRTY PERCENT. APPLE VALLEY THE BRAKES REDRESS CLIMATE CHANGE INCLUDES POLICIES CHRIS BUILDING EFFICIENCY. RENEWABLE POWER OUR RENEWABLE FUELS ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES. CLEAN AFRAID OPTIONS AN ECONOMY WIDE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM. AND PROTECTION OF OUR NATURAL WORKING LANDS. WE'VE MADE A LOT OF PROGRESS AND I WANTED TO GO THROUGH JUST A FEW QUICK EXAMPLES THAT. YOU IN THE PUBLIC CAN CONCEDE THAT NOT ONLY DO WE HAVE GOALS BUT WITH WITH CHEATING THAT. CALIFORNIA'S ACHIEVED ITS TWENTY TWENTY RENEWABLE ENERGY GOALS ALLEY. TODAY 63% OF THE STATE'S ELECTRICITY RETAIL SALES. COME FROM CARPENTRY SOURCES. YOU TO NATIONALLY ENERGY EFFICIENCIES CALIFORNIANS NOW USE 31% LESS ENERGY THAN THE AVERAGE AMERICAN. AND THE STATE'S APPLIANCE AND BUILDING ENERGY EFFICIENCY STANDARDS HAVE RESULTED IN A HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS. IN CONSUMER SAVINGS OVER THE PAST FORTY EIGHT. WE'VE ALSO ACTED AS AN ENVIRONMENTAL BACKSTOP AS I MENTIONED TO THE FORMER TRUMP ADMINISTRATION. SIGNING OF OLIVE TREE FRAME- COME CLEAN CAR STANDARDS WITH FIVE AUTOMAKERS AND FIGHTING TO PROTECT FOR OUR COMMUNITIES. IN TIMES OF ASK QUALITY. CALIFORNIA IS A GLOBALLY RECOGNIZED LEADER ON THE TRANSITION TO ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES AND MY HOME TO EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES. TOTALING 45% OF THE COUNTRY'S ELECTRIC CARS. NO WAY BY COMPARISON HAS THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND. THAT BEING SAID WE LOVE NO WAY FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO MISSED THE SUPERBOWL ADVERT WILL FERRELL THEY ALL WENT TO NORWAY TO LOOK AT HOW TO DO ELECTRIC VEHICLES WE GOT MORE THAN TWICE THE NUMBER OF ELECTRIC VEHICLES WILL FERRELL COULD JUST. STATING CALIFORNIA. WE HAVE TO THIRTY FOUR ELECTRIC VEHICLE MANUFACTURERS AND EASY'S ON THE STATE NUMBER ONE VALUE TO EXPLORE AT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS. AND CALIFORNIANS CAN NOW CHOOSE FROM SIXTY FOUR ELECTRIC VEHICLE MODELS. LAST YEAR THE END RESULT IS BOARD ADOPTED THE TRYING TO CLEAN TRUCK RULES. THE FIRST IN THE NATION PROGRAM TO ENSURE RAPID TRANSITION TO ZERO EMISSION MEDIUM TRUCKS BY TWENTY THIRTY FIVE. AND HEAVY DUTY TRUCKS BY TWENTY FORTY FIVE. PLAYING OUT HOW FREIGHT SECTOR AND GOODS MOVEMENT IS CRITICAL TO ADDRESSING% ENVIRONMENTAL INJUSTICE. IN DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES WHO HAVE BEEN DISPROPORTIONATELY BURDENED BY THESE ALL AND TOXIC EMISSIONS ALONG AFRAID CARDINALS. WILL ALSO CLEANING UP OUR FUELS CALIFORNIA'S LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD HAS RESULTED IN THE DISPLACEMENT. OF NEARLY SEVENTEEN BILLION GALLONS OF PETROLEUM BASED FUEL AND WILL SOON BE LAUNCHING OUT PROCESS AS YOU HAD FROM ROSS. TO LAUNCH THE SCALPING PLAN WHICH WILL CHART THE COURSE TO CARBON. NEUTRALITY IN TWENTY FORTY FIVE. WILL CONTINUE TO EQUITY INTO OUR PROGRAMS THROUGH THE SCOPING PLANS ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ADVISORY COMMITTEE ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE LEADERS WILL CONTINUE TO HELP US SHAPE OUR CARBON NEUTRAL FUTURE. WILL BE SOLICITING MEMBERS TO THE E. J. ADVISORY COMMITTEE NEXT MONTH. CALIFORNIA IS ALREADY EXPERIENCING WORSENING IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE LAST YEAR WE EXPERIENCE AS MANY OF YOU FELT PLEASANTLY THE HOTTEST AUGUST ON RECORD. AND SOME OF THE LARGEST WILDFIRES IN THE STATE'S HISTORY. GOVERNOR NEWSOM RECOGNIZE THE NEED TO ACCELERATE OUR ACTIONS ON CLIMATE AND ISSUED EXECUTIVE ORDERS ON ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES NATIONAL WETLANDS TO MOVE US TOWARDS AN EQUITABLE LOW CARBON AND RESILIENT FUTURE. ON THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM IN SPECIFICS I'M THIS IS BEEN A KEY STRATEGY IN OUR PORTFOLIO TO ACHIEVING OUR GHG REDUCTIONS SINCE AB THIRTY TO ASSIGN. LAST SUMMER AS YOU MENTIONED I SEND YOU A LETTER ABOUT USING THE NEXT COPING PLAN UPDATES REVIEWS THE ROLE OF CAP AND TRADE IN MEETING ON TWENTY THIRTY TARGET. THAT IS STILL THE PLAN AND THE SCOPING PLAN UPDATE WILL BEGIN THIS SPRING BUT THE FINAL PLAN THE COBBLED IN LATE TWENTY TWENTY TO FOR CONSIDERATION. WE'RE CALLING ON THE OUR CLIMATE POLICIES TO DO MORE IN THE NEXT DECADE. WE HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO ACCELERATE THE RATE OF EMISSION REDUCTIONS DRAMATICALLY. OPPORTUNITIES TO FURTHER STRENGTHEN THE CASH IN TRADE PROGRAM WILL BEGIN AS PART OF THE PUBLIC PROCESS TO UPDATE THE SCOPING PLAN. DO SO NOW WOULD BE PREMATURE. THE PROGRAMS IN THE LAST DECADE IS VERY DIFFERENT FROM THE ONE THAT CAME INTO PLACE JUST SIX WEEKS AGO. I'M TWENTY TWENTY ONE TO TWENTY THIRTY THE CASH DROPS BY 4% EACH YEAR THAT'S TWICE THE RATE FROM WHAT IT DROPPED IN THE LAST DECADE AND THAT'S A REALLY BIG DEAL. IN TERMS OF EMISSION REDUCTIONS IT'S EQUIVALENT TO RETIRING TWELVE CEMENT LINES IN OUR STATE- YEAH. AND THIS PROGRAM JUST CAME INTO EFFECT SIX WEEKS AGO WAS THE ONE THAT WAS DESIGNED THROUGH LEGISLATIVE DIRECTION. AS YOU KNOW AB THREE NINETY EIGHT PLACE SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS ON THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM FROM TWENTY TWENTY ONE TO TWENTY THIRTY. THESE REQUIREMENTS ALONG WITH THE AMBITION PROVIDED BY. SENATE BILL THIRTY TWOS GHG REDUCTION TARGET FORM THE BASIS OF HOW THE PROGRAM WILL CONTINUE TO ACHIEVE EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS THROUGH TWENTY THIRTY. IN RECOGNIZING THE PROGRAM'S ROLE IN ENSURING COST EFFECTIVE EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS EIGHTY THREE NINETY EIGHT REQUIRED TOP TO ADD A PRICE CEILING TO ENSURE THAT WOULD NOT BE ADDRESS IMPACTS TO THE ECONOMY. ENERGY RAISING CONSUMER. IS A PARTICULARLY. AT A TIME WHEN ACCORDING TO THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION EIGHT MILLION CALIFORNIANS TODAY AS STRUGGLING TO PAY THEIR UTILITY BILLS. EIGHTY THREE NINETY EIGHT ALSO REQUIRES COBB REMOVE ALLOWANCES THAT REMAIN UNSOLD AT AUCTION FOR MORE THAN TWENTY FOUR MONTHS FROM GENERAL CIRCULATION CORRESPONDING TO PERIODS OF LOW DEMOTT. DURING TWENTY SIXTEEN AND SEVENTEEN WHEN THERE'S POLITICAL UNCERTAINTY WE REMOVED ABOUT FORTY MILLION ALLOWANCES FROM GENERAL CIRCULATION. THIS RECOGNIZE THAT THERE MAY BE PERIODS WHERE THE MANTRA ALLOWANCES WOULD BE LOVE AND THE NEED TO ADJUST ALLOWING SUPPLY WOULD REFLECT MARKET TOMORROW. SINCE DEMAND WAS LOW DUE TO LOWER EMISSIONS DURING THE PANDEMIC UNSOLD ALLOWANCES WILL NOT BE AUCTIONED AND LESS DEMAND INCREASES. THE LIMIT ON OFFSETS THE COULD BE USED TO COMPLY WITH THE PROGRAM BETWEEN% TWENTY TWELVE AND TWENTY TWENTY. EIGHT PERCENT. AB THREE NINETY EIGHT REQUIRED THAT WE LIMIT THAT TOO HOT SO HALF OF THAT AMOUNT STARTING IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE. WITH ALL THESE REQUIREMENTS AND LAW COBB UNDERTOOK AN EXHAUSTIVE NEARLY TWO YEAR RULE MAKING TO AMEND CAP AND TRADE REGULATIONS. TO CONFORM TO THE LEGISLATIVE DIRECTION IN AB THREE NINETY EIGHT. THE BOARD ALSO VOTED TO REMOVE ALLOWANCES FROM TWENTY TWENTY ONE TO TWENTY THIRTY IN RECOGNITION THAT WE ACHIEVED OUR TWENTY TWENTY TAGLIATELLE I WOULD BE BELOW THE AB THIRTY TWO TARGET IN TWENTY TWENTY. THIS IS TO FURTHER ADJUST THE PROGRAM IN RESPONSE TO GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS REPORTING AND MODELING. COBB TOOK THESE AMENDMENTS AT THE DIRECTION OF THE LEGISLATURE AND EXISTING PROGRAM MEETS THE AUTHORITY AND MANDATE PROVIDED BY THE LOCAL IMPORTANTLY AB THREE NINETY EIGHT KEEPS INTACT THE DECADES LONG THERAPY ED DISTRICTS TO REGULATE REFINERIES AND OIL AND GAS FACILITIES HARMFUL CRITERIA POLLUTANTS. AND TOXIC AIR CONTAMINANTS THAT AUTHORITY IS NOT ALTERED IN ANY WAY. WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO SEE THE SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION OF THREE NINETY EIGHT AND A CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM AND TO REVIEWING THE ROLE THE PROGRAM AND MEETING OUR GHG TARGETS AS PART OF THE UPCOMING TWENTY TWENTY TWO SCOPING PLAN. UPDATE ANY CHANGES WOULD NEED TO BE CAREFULLY THOUGHT THROUGH AND ACCOMPANIED. BY ECONOMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROCESS THESE AS PART OF THE COB RULEMAKING. WHAT HAPPENED TRADE PROGRAMS PURPOSE IS TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. 80% ACROSS 80% OF THE STATE'S FOSSEL SECTORS THE AUCTION REVENUE BENEFIT IS AN IMPORTANT THING TO HIGHLIGHT. DAY ARE IN SANCHEZ WILL GO INTO THESE NUMBERS IN GREATER DETAIL IN A FEW MINUTES. THE DAY THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM HAS GENERATED ALMOST THIRTEEN BILLION DOLLARS IN AUCTION PROCEEDS TO FUND CRITICAL CLIMATE INVESTMENT PROGRAMS. NOTABLY OF THE SIX POINT THREE BILLION THAT HAS ALREADY BEEN IMPLEMENTED ABOUT PROVIDED BENEFITS THE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. COMMUNITIES WHERE INVESTMENTS A CAT ARE REALIZING A WIDE RANGE OF BENEFITS INCLUDING INCREASED AFFORDABLE HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES CLEAN ATHLETES YOUR MISSION VEHICLES. ENERGY AND WATER SAVINGS AND GREEN- MORE VIBRANT COMMUNITY. THE GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE ORDER REQUIRING SALES OF ALL NEW PASSENGER VEHICLES TO BE ZERO EMISSION BY TWENTY THIRTY FIVE AND ALL OPERATIONS OF MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES TO BE A FORTY FIVE. WILL AGGRESSIVELY MOVED THE STATE FURTHER AWAY FROM ITS RELIANCE ON CLIMATE HOLDING FOSSIL FUELS WHILE RETAINING AND CREATING JOBS SPURRING ECONOMIC GROWTH AND IMPROVING AIR QUALITY. THE TRANSPORTATION EXECUTIVE ORDER TACKLES EVERY ELEMENT OF HOW WE MOVE GOODS AND PEOPLE THROUGH THE STATE FROM POLLS AND RAIL YARDS TO HIGHWAYS AND DISTRIBUTION CENTERS. IT'S DESIGNED TO CLEAN UP THE AIR IN THE MOST VULNERABLE VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES FAST. INVESTMENT EVIDENCE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUNDS TO SUPPORT THE SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION OF THOSE THAT EXECUTIVE ORDER WE'LL SEE SEVERAL FORMS OF RETURNS INCLUDING PUBLIC HEALTH AND ECONOMIC BENEFITS. THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED BUDGET INCLUDING ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DEDICATED TO JUMPSTARTING THE ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE EXECUTIVE HOLD IMPLEMENTATION. WILL WITH ALMOST FIVE HUNDRED MILLION AND ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE INVESTMENTS AND I PROPOSE ONE BILLION IN INFRASTRUCTURE. WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU ALL ON DELIVERING A CLIMB AND SEVEN BUDGET THAT LISTS OUT ALL CALIFORNIANS. WE ALSO HOPEFUL AND EXCITED TO HAVE WITHIN YOU FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION. THE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION'S PERSISTENT ATTACKS ON HEALTH SCIENCE AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION COST US PRECIOUS TIME. WE'VE SEEN AN IMMEDIATE FOCUS ON THE PROVIDING TEAM ON A CLEAN CAR AGENDA OUR ON GOING LEFT RIDGES POWERFUL SUPER POLLUTANTS FROM WASTE AND OIL AND GAS. UNDER THIRTEEN EIGHTY THREE AND PRIORITIZING ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ACROSS THAT CLIMATE APHIDS. WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU AND OTHER CRITICAL PART AS AN OUT COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE ON CLIMATE AND ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE. AS WE RACE TOWARDS A CARBON NEUTRAL FUTURE. THANK YOU AND I LOOK FORWARD TO TAKING COMMENTS AT THE END OF QUESTIONS IF THERE ARE ANY ENERGY OKAY NO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT FURTHER OVERSIGHT AND I'VE- I WAS REMINDED WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE CLEAN CAR PRODUCTION DEAD YOU KNOW TESLA MANUFACTURING FACILITIES IN MY DISTRICT. DURING THE PANDEMIC THEY HAVE GONE FROM TEN THOUSAND EMPLOYEES TO TWENTY THOUSAND EMPLOYEES MAY I KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF NOISE ABOUT. THE LAWN MOWER MOVING TO TEXAS AND I WONDER HOW THAT'S WORKING OUT OF MINUS TEN DEGREES THIS MORNING BUT BUT THIS ISN'T THERE THERE ARE IMPACTS THAT WE HAVEN'T BRUSHED ON THANK YOU. CHEER RANDOLPH WELCOME TO SUBCOMMITTEE. TO THE YOU HAVE THE FLOOR. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH CHAIR AND MEMBERS- I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK HERE TODAY AS- I BEGIN MY FIRST FEW MONTHS OF MY TENURE HERE AT THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD. I FEEL INCREDIBLY PRIVILEGED TO DO THIS WORK THE MONUMENTAL TASK OF REDUCING AIR POLLUTION AND COMBATING CLIMATE CHANGE- AND THEN- AS YOU MENTIONED WE SEE RECORD COLD HITTING STATES THAT ARE ILL PREPARED FOR THAT IMPACT- AND ADDS SECRETARY BLUMENFELD. MENTION E IN CALIFORNIA ARE SEEING CLIMATE IMPACTS HERE- AND WE NEED TO BE FIGHTING IT AS EFFECTIVELY AS WE CAN. YOU'RE ALSO REMINDED THAT- THAT LAKE OF GLOBAL THE GLOBAL PANDEMIC CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS ARE FELT MOST STRONGLY BY THOSE WHO ARE LEAST EQUIPPED TO HANDLE IT. AS WE DISCUSSED THE COMPLEX NUANCES OF HOW WE DO THIS WORK. WE NEED TO KEEP IN MIND THAT WE NEED TO BE PROTECTING THOSE MOST VULNERABLE. AS WE DO THIS WORK. I JUST STARTED RECEIVING BRIEFINGS ON CARBS MANY PROGRAMS INCLUDING THE STATE'S WORLD LEADING CLIMATE CHANGE POLICIES. I LOOK FORWARD TO PARTNERING PARTNERING WITH THE LEGISLATURE AS WE CONTINUE TO WORK ON LONG TERM CLIMATE SOLUTIONS NOT JUST IN CALIFORNIA BUT NATIONALLY AND GLOBALLY AS WELL. FOR I SPEAK ON THE SPECIFICS OF THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM I WANT TO EMPHASIZE CARBS ORIGINAL MISSION THE REDUCTION OF AIR POLLUTION AND THE PROTECTION OF PUBLIC HEALTH. IN THE PAST FEW YEARS CITED BY THE LEGISLATURE. HARPIST ASSISTANT WE FOCUSED ON REDUCING AIR POLLUTION IN THE MOST BURDEN COMMUNITIES IN OUR STATE. AS WE PURSUE OUR CLIMATE GOALS AND TO MAINTAIN OUR EFFORTS TO REDUCE AIR POLLUTION IN PRIORITY AND ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE. THE MASS YOU MORE. DID THAT END THERE ARE SEVERAL NEW REGULATIONS UNDER DEVELOPMENT OR RECENTLY ADOPTED THAT CONTINUE TO DIRECTLY TARGET POLLUTION IN THESE COMMUNITIES. AS CHAIR BLOOMING AS SECRETARY OF WOMEN SHALL DISCUSS ONE REGULATION REQUIRES ZERO EMISSION DELIVERY TRUCKS AND CARGO HANDLING EQUIPMENT. BY TWENTY THIRTY FIVE AND ALL TRACKS TO HAVE ZERO EMISSION TECHNOLOGY BY TWENTY FORTY FIVE. I NAY REGULATION ENSURES THAT TRUCKS BUT STILL USE CONVENTIONAL FUELS- ULTRA CLEAN WATER ZERO EMISSION TRUCKS COME ONLINE. AND UNDER EIGHTY SIX SEVENTEEN COMMUNITY AIR PROTECTION PROGRAM WE CONTINUE TO WORK WITH AIR DISTRICTS IN IMPACTED COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE. WHAT SPECIFIC PLANS AND USED FOCUSED TOOLS TO DIRECTLY REDUCE LOCAL POLLUTION AND REDUCE EXPOSURE FOR COMMUNITY RESIDENTS. NOW I WANT TO KNOW HOW THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM FITS WITHIN OUR OVERALL CLIMATE PLANNING WILL BE AB STAGE TO CLIMATE CHANGE THAT THE PLAN. THE FIRST AB THIRTY TWO SCOPING PLAN COMPLETED IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT SERVED AS THE STATE'S ACTIONABLE PLAN FOR HOW TO ACHIEVE THE STATE'S TWENTY TWENTY GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION GOAL. LAYING OUT POLICIES AND PROGRAMS TO REDUCE EMISSIONS TO NINETEEN NINETY LEVELS BY TWENTY TWENTY. LOOTED AND MIX IT INTENT IS REGULATION. AND A CARBON SHE IN THE FORM AS CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM. THE SCOPING PLAN ALSO AS NOTED EARLIER INCLUDES. AN ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ADVISORY COMMITTEE OR THE E. JACK THIS REMAINS AN IMPORTANT SPACE FOR US TO WORK DIRECTLY WITH ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE AND COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS TO ENSURE THAT THEIR VIEWS ARE INCORPORATED INTO ARTWORK. I TO SKIPPING PLAN UPDATES IN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN AND TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN FOLLOW THE INITIALS AT THE PLAN. THE TWENTY THIRTEEN SKIPPING PLAN UPDATE REVIEWED THE PROGRESS OF THE PROGRAM AND LAID THE FOUNDATION FOR LONGER TERM EMISSION REDUCTIONS BEYOND TWENTY TWENTY. THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN SCOPING PLAN UPDATE LAID OUT THE PLAN TO ACHIEVING THE TWENTY THIRTY GREENHOUSE-GAS GOALS SET BY SB THIRTY TWO. TO REDUCE GHG EMISSIONS 40% BELOW NINETEEN NINETY LEVELS BY TWENTY THIRTY AND AGAIN UNDERSCORED THE NEED FOR A PACKAGE OF COMPLEMENTARY MEASURES. AS WE ALL KNOW THE STATE NOT ONLY A TEACHER TWENTY TWENTY ALL THAT DID SO A FULL FOUR YEARS EARLY. IT WAS THE SWEET OF POLICIES IN THE SCOPING PLAN NOT JUST THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM THAT HELPED US MEET THAT TARGET. THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN TO COPING PLAN CULTURE MANY OF THE EXISTING PROGRAMS TO BECOME MORE STRINGENT FROM. TWENTY TWENTY ONE TO TWENTY THIRTY HELP ACHIEVE THE TWENTY THIRTY TARGET. RAMPS THAT WERE INCREASED IN STRINGENCY INCLUDE THE RENEWABLE PORTFOLIO STANDARD THE LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD AND THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM. YOUR CAR BEGINS WORKING ON ANOTHER SKIPPING PLAN UPDATE THAT WILL EVALUATE OUR PROGRESS FOR ACHIEVING THE TWENTY THIRTY TARGET. AND LAY OUT THE PATH FOR ACHIEVING CARBON NEUTRALITY. THE SCRAPPING PLAN UPDATE IS NOT JUST A FORWARD LOOKING DOCUMENT BUT ALSO A FIVE YEAR OPPORTUNITY TO REVIEW OUR PROGRESS WE EXAMINE OUR PROGRAMS AND CONSIDER DEVELOPMENT IN EACH SECTOR TO BETTER UNDERSTAND WHAT THE CASE MAY BE WARRANTED TO ENSURE THE MOST EFFECTIVE PATH TO ARTICLE. THIS INCLUDES SIGNIFICANT MODELING AND ANALYSES TO ENSURE THAT ANY CHANGES OUR DATA AND SCIENCE BASED AND EVIDENCE DRIVEN. NOW I WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT- BEFORE TALKING ABOUT THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM IN MORE DETAIL TO GIVE A DISCLAIMER UP FRONT. I HAVE TO USE CAUTION WHEN DISCUSSING THE FUTURE OF THE PROGRAM AND ANY FUTURE CHANGES WE MAY MAY. I HAVE A FIDUCIARY RESPONSIBILITY AS THE MARKET ADMINISTRATOR ESPECIALLY SINCE THE NEXT AUCTION IS TOMORROW TO ENSURE THAT NOTHING IN MY TESTIMONY OR RESPONSES TO COMMITTEE QUESTIONS WILL SWAY THE MARKET ONE WAY OR THE OTHER. WE KNOW POLITICAL UNCERTAINTY AND STATEMENTS WE MAKE AS ADMINISTRATORS CAN IMPACT MARKET. SPECIFICALLY IT HAD HAS BEEN THE CASE SINCE THE PROGRAM'S INCEPTION INCEPTION ANY POTENTIAL ADJUSTMENTS TO IMPROVE THE PROGRAM WILL BE STRESSED DISCUSSED IN AN OPEN PUBLIC PROCESS TO ENSURE THAT ALL STAKEHOLDERS HAVE ACCESS TO THE SAME INFORMATION. AS MENTIONED THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM WAS AUTHORIZED BY AB THIRTY TWO IN TWO THOUSAND SIX. IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN AB THREE NINETY EIGHT LAID OUT THE ROLE OF THE LEGISLATURE ENVISIONED FOR THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM IN ACHIEVING THE TWENTY THIRTY TARGET. THE LEGISLATURE MADE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM IN EIGHTY THREE NINETY EIGHT. THOSE CHANGES WERE OUTLINED BY SECRETARY BLUMENFELD. BUT INCLUDED REDUCING THE ASSET USAGE LIMIT AND ADDING A PRICE CEILING AMONG OTHERS. IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN CARBON MENDED THE CAP AND TRADE REGULATION TO ALIGN WITH THE LEGISLATIVE DIRECTION IN AB THREE NINETY EIGHT IN A ROBUST REGULATORY PROCESS AND THOSE CHANGES TOOK EFFECT ON JANUARY FIRST OF THIS YEAR. AB THREE NINETY EIGHT LEGISLATIVELY DESIGN PROGRAM HAS ONLY BEEN IN OPERATION FOR SIX WEEKS. AS A RESULT THE IMPACT OF THESE CHANGES ON THE PROGRAM THE MARKET AND THE REGULATED ENTITIES IS NOT YET NOW. KARBALA NEED TO COLLECT DATA TO ANALYZE THE EFFECTS OF THE LEGISLATURE'S CHANGES AS PART OF THE NEXT COPING PLAN UPDATE. AT THAT TIME IF NECESSARY SCIENCE BASED AND EVIDENCE DRIVEN CHANGES TO THE PROGRAM IF BE PROPOSED AND EXAMINED. THIS IS THE STANDARD PRACTICE AT HARPER COLLEGE PROGRAM AND SINCE THE ADOPTION OF THE CAP AND TRADE REGULATION IN. TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN WE LAMENTED THE PROGRAM EIGHT TIMES TO IMPROVE IT. MY KIDS AND SAID ABOUT THE PROGRAM'S DESIGN AND PRICING BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO CONSIDER THE CONTEXT OF ITS ADOPTION. IN TWO THOUSAND AND SIX WHAT CALIFORNIA PROPOSED WAS GROUND BREAKING ITS POTENTIAL IMPACT AND NOW. THE EUROPEAN UNION'S EMISSIONS TRADING SYSTEM WAS IN ITS INFANCY. AND FOR THOSE WHO WERE HERE IN TWO THOUSAND AND SIX MANY IN THE LEGISLATURE EXPRESSED GRAVE CONCERNS BUT THE BROADER AB THIRTY TWO PROGRAM CALLS FOR ENERGY THE BALL. AND THAT THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM RESULT WOULD RESULT IN ECONOMIC RUIN FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IN THE CONTEXT OF THESE CONCERNS AND THE RELATIVELY UNTESTED CONCEPT OF A GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS MARKET. HARD DEVELOP THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM TO LIVE UP TO THE REQUIREMENTS THAT THE LEGISLATURE PUT IN STATUTE THAT REMAIN IN EFFECT TODAY. THIS IS FRANKLY THAT IT DIDN'T. CHANGE COST EFFECTIVE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS. AND WE CAN SEE THE RESULTS WE ACHIEVED OUR TWENTY TWENTY CALL. IN TWENTY SIXTEEN NOT ONLY WITHOUT HARMING THE ECONOMY BUT AT SECRETARY BLUMENFELD HIGHLIGHTED CALIFORNIA GROUP TO THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD AND IT'S BECOME A MAGNET FOR BUSINESSES RESPONDING TO THE LEGISLATURE'S LEADERSHIP ON CLIMATE CHANGE. BUT I DON'T WANT TO UNDERSELL THE CHALLENGE WE FACE AS WE LOOK TOWARDS TWENTY THIRTY AND TWENTY FORTY FIVE. MUCH OF OUR REDUCTIONS HAVE COME FROM A MASSIVE TRANSFORMATION IN THE ENERGY SECTOR AWAY FROM FOSSIL FUELS TO RENEWABLES. AND THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR IS WHERE WE MUST NOW SHIFT OUR FOCUS SINCE IT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ROUGHLY HALF OF THE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. AND OVER 90% OF THE HARMFUL DIESEL AIR POLLUTION IN THE STATE. TRANSITIONING CALIFORNIA'S MASSIVE PERSONAL AND COMMERCIAL VEHICLE FLEETS HE ZERO EMISSIONS WILL REQUIRE A DIFFICULT UNPRECEDENTED LEVEL OF EFFORT. BUT IT WILL BENEFIT BOTH CLIMATE CHANGE AND AIR QUALITY BECAUSE ZERO EMISSIONS AND ZERO EMISSION. I'D LIKE TO CLOSE BY REITERATING MY ENTHUSIASM FOR WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATURE AS WE CONTINUE TO IMPROVE AIR QUALITY FOR THE RESIDENTS OF CALIFORNIA. AND AS WELL AS WORKING TOGETHER TO ACHIEVE OUR AMBITIOUS CLIMATE GOALS SUCH AS CODIFYING THE GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE ORDER. TO MAKE CARBON NEUTRALITY OCAL FOR THE LEGISLATURE IS WELL AND REDUCING EMISSIONS FROM OUR LARGEST SOURCES IN THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR. THANK YOU AND I LOOK FORWARD TO THE DISCUSSION. THANK YOU AND THAT WE- DO APPLAUD THE HISTORIC WORK THAT THAT CARPETS DONE ON- LUCIAN AND THAT CONTINUES TO BE A MAIN ROLE THAT WE HAVE I KNOW WHEN WE TALK ABOUT CARBON PROGRAMS WE GET A LITTLE FUZZY WERE PEOPLE TALK ABOUT. THAT DECARBONISATION IS THE SAME THING IS IT AIR POLLUTION AND WE KNOW KNOX AND SOCKS ARE OF AIR POLLUTION PROBLEM NOT NECESSARY THE METHANE PROBLEM AND THE CARBON PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE SO WE'RE GLAD WE HAVE. PEOPLE HERE THAT KNOW THAT OUR NECKS PROFESSOR FROM STANFORD I HAVE YOUR BOOK HERE MAKING COMIC POLICY WORK FOR FROM THE SECRETARY YOU FOR FROM THE ALLEY- IN YOUR FOR FROM THE NEW TO. A CHAIR OF THE AIRPORT. WHAT'S YOUR THOUGHTS ON HOW WE CAN MAKE THE WESTERN CLIMATE INITIATIVE POLICY WORK HERE IN CALIFORNIA. MISTER COLLINS PROFESSOR CALLING FOR. GOOD MORNING CHOI PESKY THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE AND GOOD MORNING MEMBERS OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE- LET ME JUST SAY A FEW WORDS ABOUT THE CONTEXT OF WHERE WE'VE BEEN A THINK OF THE THREE PREVIOUS SPEAKERS LAID THIS OUT. VERY WELL- I THINK WHAT WE ARE FUNDAMENTALLY TALKING ABOUT THIS PROGRAM IS IT'S IMPORTANT EMPHASIZE THIS PROGRAM IS ABOUT HALF OF THE REDUCTIONS THAT ARE PLANNED. IN THE MOST RECENT SCOPING UNTIL WE TALK ABOUT THE MIX OF CALIFORNIA'S CLIMATE POLICIES AND THERE ARE MANY AND MANY OF THEM ARE VERY SUCCESSFUL HOW TO TREAT IS FAR AND AWAY THE BIGGEST IN TERMS OF THE PLANNED ROLE FOR THE NEXT STAGE OF THE CLIMATE POLICY PORTFOLIO- AND SO I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO TALK ABOUT THAT AND GET THAT RIGHT BECAUSE IT'S NOT JUST SORT OF ONE AMONG MANY. IT'S BY FAR THE BIGGEST ELEMENT OF THAT PORTFOLIO- AND IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO TALK ABOUT THAT BECAUSE IT. IS A QUESTION OF WHERE WE GO IN THE FUTURE AND THE QUESTION I THINK OF SCIENTIFIC INTEGRITY TO TALK THROUGH WHAT ALL OF THIS MEANS- I THINK A LOT OF WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE IS FRANKLY A PRETTY FUNDAMENTAL DISCONNECT ON THE WAY SOME OF THE DECISIONS WERE MADE IN THE PAST ABOUT. HOW TO IMPLEMENT THE ROLE FOR THAT PROGRAM- AND I'M I'M CONCERNED THAT IF WE REPEAT THAT EXERCISE WITHOUT A DEEPER COMMITMENT. TO SCIENTIFIC INTEGRITY AND TRANSPARENCY WILL END UP IN A SIMILARLY CONFLICTED POSITION- BUT I WELCOME THE OPPORTUNITY AND THE REMARKS MADE. BY THE SECRETARY AND THE NEW BOARD CHAIR. HAVE THAT KIND OF DISCUSSION INAPPROPRIATE. OF PUBLIC REGULATORY PROCESS IN THE FUTURE BECAUSE THAT IS HOW CALIFORNIA IS GOING TO SHOW ITS LEADERSHIP ON THESE ISSUES AND I THINK THAT'S THAT'S JUST CRITICAL IMPORTANT. BEFORE I GET INTO A LITTLE BIT MORE TO THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM. I ALSO WANT TO MENTION- I AM OFTEN A SPEAKER YOU INVITE TO SPEAK ABOUT CAP AND TRADE ISSUES WHICH MEANS I DON'T GET ENOUGH OPPORTUNITIES TO COMMENCE THE BOARD- FOR THEIR SUCCESS ON ISSUES LIKE THE CLEAN TRUCKS ROLL IN MOBILE SOURCE REGULATIONS WERE THINK IT'S UNEQUIVOCAL THAT CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN OF THE GLOBAL LEADERSHIP- FOR FRONT. ON THESE ISSUES- NEVERTHELESS I THINK WE DO HAVE TO TALK OPENLY AND FRANKLY ABOUT THE PERFORMANCE OF THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM GOING INTO THE NEXT SCOPING PLAN. THE FUNDING ISSUE- FROM MY PERSPECTIVE IS WHEN ONE LOOKS AT THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN SCOPE AND THE MOST RECENT PLANNING DOCUMENT HOW THE STATE IS GOING TO ACHIEVE-THE SB THIRTY TWO GOAL. WE SEE NOT ONLY THIS MAJOR EMPHASIS ON THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM. BUT A DISCUSSION OF THE CAMPING TRIP PROGRAM IS A WAY TO ENSURE. THAT THE STATE WILL ACHIEVE ITS GOALS BECAUSE IT WILL PERFORM SOME SORT OF HARD CAP LIKE FUNCTION AND REDUCE EMISSIONS NO MATTER WHAT- WHEN ONE LOOKS AT THE LANGUAGE AND ANALYSIS IN THE SCOPE AND PLAN. AND COMPARES IT TO THE LANGUAGE AND THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN RULES I THINK THERE'S A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT DISCONNECT. IN HE MODELING AND TECHNICAL WORK AND ASSERTIONS THAT ARE MADE AS BETWEEN THOSE TWO. POLICY PROCESS HE'S NOT DISCONNECT THANKS THE SOURCE OF A LOT OF THE TENSIONS WE TALKED ABOUT TODAY- SO ONE OF THE THINGS I WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT IN MY TESTIMONY THIS MORNING IS THAT THE INDEPENDENT EMISSIONS MARKET ADVISORY COMMITTEE. I WHERE I SERVED AS THE SENATE APPOINTEE- ROADS PACIFIC WE ON THIS ISSUE. AND I UNDERSTAND IT'S BEEN INCLUDED IN THE BACKGROUND MATERIALS FOR TODAY'S HEARING. I BRING THIS UP BECAUSE THE BOARD HAS A NUMBER OF CHOICES ABOUT HOW TO. PROCEED WITH THE WAY IT THANKS ABOUT THIS PROGRAM IN THE SCHOOL COMPOUND PROCESS AND THEN IN ANY FUTURE REGULATORY PROCESS USE THAT MY DEMAND THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM. AND THE I AM ACT CHAPTER ADDRESSES SOME OF THESE TENSIONS AND ISSUES HISTORICALLY AND I HOPE IT'S SOMETHING THAT THAT WE CAN WORK THROUGH AND TALK ABOUT. BECAUSE CONSISTENCY BETWEEN THE SCOPING PLAN. AND THE REGULATORY PACKAGE- UNDERLYING THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM IS ESSENTIAL TO MEET WHATEVER SET OF GOALS AND DECISIONS. THAT THIS ADMINISTRATION AND THE BOARD WANTS TO TAKE- SO I THINK THAT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT AREA TO HIGHLIGHT FOR THE POTENTIAL FOR CONSISTENCY TO RESOLVE SOME OF THESE TENSIONS. I WANT TO ADD THAT. IN A COUPLE OF THE THINGS I'VE HEARD MAY BE RELEVANT FOR THE COMMITTEE'S. CONSIDERATION THE- QUESTION ABOUT WHETHER THE PRO IS FOR. WELL IS AN- AND TECHNO CONTRA- I MEAN THAT'S I UNDERSTAND THAT MEANS IT'S ALSO FREQUENTLY SOMEWHAT DELTA FOLKS. AND SOMEWHAT COMPLICATED- PART OF THE PROBLEM HERE IS THAT THERE AREN'T VERY CLEAR TECHNICAL METRICS TO TRACK PROGRAM. AND THE I MAC AMONG OTHERS HAVE RECOMMENDED THAT THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD PRODUCE THESE KINDS OF METRICS WHICH ARE STANDARD AND OTHER CAP AND TRADE PROGRAMS FOR EXAMPLE THE EAST COAST REGGIE PROGRAM. AS WELL AS THE HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL EUROPEAN UNION PROGRAM. ALL THESE METRICS TO TRACK THE QUESTION OF THE NUMBER OF OUTSTANDING ALLOWANCES AND ALSO TO THE PROGRAM. INDEED THE RESOURCES FORTY ONE HAS SUCH A METRIC FOR THE LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD BUT- FOUR YEARS HAS BEEN. UNABLE OR UNWILLING TO PRODUCE SUCH A METRIC FOR THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM. YEAH I AM ACT DEVELOPED A METHOD I PUBLISHED A PEER REVIEWED SCIENTIFIC PAPER TO SHOW HOW IT COULD BE DONE. WE HAVEN'T REALLY HEARD ANYTHING ABOUT HOW THE BOARD MIGHT CONSIDER POSITIONS. AND I MENTION THIS BECAUSE WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO TRACK WHAT'S GOING ON IF YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO USE EVIDENCE BASED. BASED METHODS TO FIGURE OUT WHETHER OR NOT THE PROGRAM IS DOING WHAT WE WANTED TO DO. AND I THINK THERE'S A REALLY IMPORTANT OPPORTUNITIES TO AIM FOR A HIGHER BAR IN THE CYCLE- AND USE EVIDENCE TO GUIDE SOME OF THESE DECISIONS BECAUSE FROM MY POINT OF VIEW THAT IS. NOT A FAIR DESCRIPTION OF THE WAY THINGS WENT DOWN PREVIOUSLY. AND THAT IS NOT A COMMENT WITH RESPECT TO. THE NEW LEADERSHIP OF CALLIE PA AND THE NEW. CHAIR BOARD. I THINK. THE OTHER. COUPLE THINGS TO MENTION BRIEF- RESOLUTION EIGHTEEN FIFTY ONE PREMIER RESOURCES BOARD COMMITTED THE STAFF TO PRODUCE AN ANALYSIS OF THE NUMBER OF ALLOWANCES THAT ARE BANKS- AFTER THE PROGRAM'S TWENTY TWENTY. COMPLIANCE PERIOD. OF COMPLETES. AND THAT ANALYSIS IS DUE BY THE END OF THIS YEAR SO WE WILL PRESUMABLY HAVE SOME FORMAL PUBLIC STATEMENT FROM THE BOARD ON THESE METRICS. ARE WHERE I THINK WE ARE GOING TO SEE THAT THE NUMBER OF BANKS ALLOWANCES IS FAR IN EXCESS OF WHAT THE BOARD SAID IN ITS PREVIOUS WERE MAKING STATEMENT I THINK THAT WILL BE AN OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS. SOME OF THE CHALLENGES IN THIS PROGRAM- THE LAST THING I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT IS THAT. BOTH THE SECRETARY AND THE NEW BOARD CHAIR REFERENCE THE IDEA THAT THE A BETWEEN NINETY REGULATIONS TOOK EFFECT JUST SIX WEEKS AGO- THIS IS TRUE AS A MATTER OF LAW THE REGULATIONS TOOK EFFECT IN JANUARY OF THIS YEAR. BUT OF COURSE THEY WERE FINALIZED IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO MENTION THIS BECAUSE I THINK EVERY SINGLE PARTICIPANT IN THE MARKET HAS BEEN TRADING ON THE BASIS OF THOSE PERFECTLY UNDERSTOOD REGULATIONS. SINCE THOSE REGULATIONS WERE COMPLETED. SO WELL IT MAKES VERY GOOD SENSE. TO BE CAUTIOUS AND THOUGHTFUL AND THE MARKET REGULATOR'S ROLE AS A FIDUCIARY. I THINK IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO KNOW THE RULES AND PERFORMANCE OF THE MARKET HAS BEEN CRYSTAL CLEAR TO EVERYBODY PARTICIPATING IN THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS- AND THAT I DON'T THINK IS A- GOOD REASON TO- TALK ABOUT DEFERRING. A MORE DETAILED CONVERSATION ON WHAT SHOULD BE DONE- IF INDEED. THERE IS POTENTIALLY AN ISSUE THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED IN THE FUTURE- I THANK. MISTER CHAIR THAT WOULD BE A GOOD PLACE FOR ME TO LEAVE MY REMARKS AND I WELCOME ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS YOU MIGHT HAVE. WELL WE CERTAINLY WANT TO SHARE THAT AMBITION HAS ALL THE PANELISTS HAVE TODAY TO REALLY DECARBONIZE. OUR SOCIETY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA I GUESS YOU KNOW WERE. LET'S LET'S GO BACK TO THE BALANCE I MEAN WE'VE WE KNOW THAT THE- THERE'S A- RELIANCE ON. THE CARPENTRY TO REDUCE TO MEET OUR GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS THIS OUTLINED IN- AB- THIRTY TO THE FOR THE- SECRETARY- THE- A CHAIR DO YOU PLAN TO REFILL IT VISIT THIS BALANCE OF CAP AND TRADE AND OTHER MEASURES IN THE NEW SCOPING PLAN WHAT THE WEIGHT OF. OF THE RULE OF CAP AND TRADE SHOULD BE WILL START OFF WITH THAT GET PEOPLE'S INPUT. TAGS YES BASICALLY THE ANSWER IS YES- THAT THE- SCOPING PLANS- PROCESS WILL RELY ON AND- ANALYZING THE- EXISTING PROGRAMS AND IT'S ALREADY- TO DETERMINE HOW TO ACHIEVE REDUCTIONS AND THEN. DETERMINE WHAT ADDITIONAL REDUCTIONS I NEED TO BE. ADDRESSED BY CAP AND TRADE SO- WE KNOW THAT FOR INSTANCE THE AS THAT EXECUTIVE ORDER AND IS GOING TO HAVE SAID- THE IMPACT ON HOW WE LOOK AT. AT THE ROLE OF OTHER EMISSIONS REDUCTION STRATEGIES THAT WE WILL ABSOLUTELY- ANALYZE THAT IN THIS. EXCELLENT SECTOR BLOOMFIELD YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO ADD. NO I THINK- J. RANDALL SAID IT REALLY ARTICULATELY WHICH IS AND JUST TO KIND OF MAKE THE POINT THAT DANNY AINGE AND RANDO. MAKING IF THERE'S ANYTHING YOU KNOW THAT WHEN YOU GO AND TALK TO THE COB FOLKS THERE ARE A LOT OF PHD. PEOPLE THAT THAT RELEASE DIDN'T HAVE VERY VERY CRITICALLY ABOUT MAKING SURE WE USING METRICS AND BASING ON SCIENCE AND OUTCOMES AND THAT AND I THINK THAT'S RIGHT COBB'S BEEN SO SUCCESSFUL SAYS. DJ RANDALL'S POINT DISCOVERY PROCESS ALLOWS US TO DO THAT AND- NOW JUST AS ONE FOOTNOTE. THE EXECUTIVE ORDER THAT THE GOVERNOR CAME OUT WITH TO GET TO A 100% ZERO MISSION AND- THANK SALES BY TWENTY THIRTY FIVE WHO WILL HAVE A DRAMATIC IMPACT ON HOW THAT. HOW WE LOOK AT THOSE DIFFERENT- BALANCE IT IS INSPECTED SAYS YEAH IT. IS AN IMPORTANT POINT WE WE'VE MADE A LOT OF REFERENCES TO THE LOSCO THE PLAN- I WHEN I WHEN I TALK ABOUT THE SCOPING PLAN AND THE CROSSES THAT- LEANNE AND HER TEAM WILL UNDERTAKE- I DO IT IS PROBABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT CLIMATE THING THAT WILL HAPPEN- IT IN THE NEXT. DECADE IN CALIFORNIA BECAUSE IT REALLY WILL WILL SHAPE HOW THINGS HAPPENED SAID WE WILL PUT IN A LOT OF EMPHASIS ON THAT AND I ENVISAGE REALLY IS MAKING SURE IT'S- BUT A LOT OF PUBLIC PARTICIPATION. A LOT OF AS JAY RANDOLPH MENTIONED EQUITY AND OTHER CONSENSUS THE TABLES SET YET THAT THIS IS IMPORTANT PROCESS AND- IT'S OUR JOB IS TO LISTEN AND LEARN AND CALIBRATE. YEAH WELL WE'LL GET TODAY EXPENDITURE PLAN ON THE NEXT AND NEXT THING I KNOW WERE WERE EAGER TO GET TO THE DOES THAT PROGRAM AND I'VE OBVIOUSLY EAGER TO FIND OUT WHY C. B. R. P. IS NOT FUNDED BUT THAT'S I'M GETTING AHEAD OF MYSELF ON THE ON THE ISSUES- ONE LAST QUESTION FOR ME SINCE WE INCLUDED IN OUR- MATERIALS HERE THE- RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE- EIMAC THE INDEPENDENT. EMISSIONS MARKET ADVISORY COMMITTEE MISTER BROWN YOU SIT ON THAT BUT YOU'RE NOT A OF VOTING- MEMBER I GUESS THE QUESTION IS FOR THE SECRETARY- AND THE CHAIR RANDOLPH IS THAT. ARE YOU ANTICIPATING CONSIDERING THESE RECOMMENDATIONS AND HOW THEY HOW TO HAVE THIS CONSISTENCY WITH THE WITH THE NEW SCOPING PLAN AND THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM THIS BALANCING ACT THAT. WE'RE WE'RE GOING TO GO ON- PROFESSOR CALL WORDS. TALKED ABOUT THE MATCH BE AT THAT. YES ABSOLUTELY- WE ARE COMMITTED TO CONSIDERING ALL IMPACT INCLUDING- THAT FROM THE PUBLIC AND THE ADVISORY COMMITTEE SUCH AS IRAQ AND THE- EIGHTY THREE NINETY EIGHT OFF WORSE- SO WELL WE CAN'T REALLY. A SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATION THE PURPOSE OF THE LANDSCAPING PLAN PROCESSES TO REALLY ANALYZE ALL THAT IN PLACE AND I UNDERSTAND IT AND DEVELOP THAT THE CORRECT PLAN GOING FORWARD. THANK YOU THAT'S THAT'S BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO BE TOO MUCH OF A LAWYER BECAUSE I WANT TO GET TO VICE CHAIR DOLLIES BUT HE ANTICIPATES THE YOU KNOW WE HAVE TO DO REGULATIONS AND THE SCOPING PLAN DO EXPECT THOSE TO RUN. CAN CURRENTLY THAT YOU START WITH THE- THE RULE REVIEW AND THE SCOPING PLAN OR CONSECUTIVELY. OR DON'T KNOW. SORRY I WAS HAVING A LITTLE TROUBLE GETTING MYSELF LAST- FAN OF NEW FOR A MOMENT- SO AND WE DISCUSSED EXPECTING FINAL KICK US IN THE SPRING AND WILL BE HOLDING WORKSHOPS AND RELEASED A DRAFT IN TWENTY TWENTY TWO WITH THE WITH THE GOAL OF THE FINAL PLAN IN LATE TWENTY TWENTY PM- AND I REALLY THINK WE NEED TO- GO THROUGH THAT PROCESS IN UNDERSTAND WHAT ADDITIONAL CHANGES- WOULD BE NEEDED AS WE CONSIDER- OR AFTER WE CONSIDER. THAT SORT OF THE ROLE OF THECAP AND TRADE PROGRAM AND SO- GIVEN THE UNCERTAINTY ON THE OUTCOME AND THAT AND THE PROCESS OF THE SCOPING PLAN- I DON'T KNOW THAT WE CAN MAKE A SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATION AS TO KIND OF A REGULATORY TIMELINE- OR EVEN WHETHER AT SIGNIFICANT REGULATORY CHANGES ARE NECESSARY SO I THINKTHAT IS A KIND OF A TO BE DETERMINED TO QUESTION. OKAY BECAUSE I KNOW THE GOVERNOR HAS MADE A LOT OF ANNOUNCEMENTS AND EARLY ACTION AND THINGS THAT HE WANTS TO DO WHEN AND HOW WE CAN MEET THE MOMENT RIGHT WE CAN MEET THE MOMENT SO HOPEFULLY PEOPLE IN FINANCE WE CAN DO THESE THINGS CONCURRENTLY TO SHOW OUR TO SHOW THE WORLD OUR AMBITION HERE AND IN CALIFORNIA. MISTER BROWN. YOU HAVE ANYTHING THAT YOU WANT TO COMMENT ON. MY LOOKING AT THE EVERYBODY'S FACE. OKAY A CENTER DOLLY HAS QUESTIONS WELL THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I JUST WANNA SAY ON I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH ALL THE NEW- FOLKS WHO ARE. AT THE AIRPORT IN EPA- BUT I WANT I JUST WANNA MAKE SOME GENERAL COMMENTS TO START OUT WITH. AND I SAID TO THE LAST GO BEING HEARING- WHAT THAT TIME WAS ASSEMBLY MEMBER- CHESBRO AND WE HAD- MARY NICHOLS THERE AND WE ASKED THEN- I ASKED. ABOUT TOTAL CARMEN CARMEN IN CALIFORNIA WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT CARBON AND WILL MOSTLY FOCUS TODAY'S BEEN ON. EMISSIONS DRIVE FROM TRANSPORTATION AND WE DON'T REALLY TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THAT THERE'S BEEN A HUGE AMOUNT OF CARBON- RELEASE FROM FOREST FIRE. AND SO IT'S BEEN ONE OF MY PET PEEVES I'VE I TALK ABOUT ALL THE TIME AND I TYPICALLY GET. ALVO DID. MOSTLY ON MOST COMMITTEES I SAID ON- MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE I'M I'M IN A DIFFERENT- LOOK THOUGHT PROCESS I GUESS. BUT WHAT I WANTED TO SAY IS THAT. WE NEED TO LOOK AT HOLISTICALLY AT OR CARBON OUTPUT BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE DAY WE CAN DO ALL KINDS OF THINGS THAT AND I WANT TO SHARE ALSO THAT. I'M A FARMER. AS FOOD FOR PEOPLE EAT THAT I'M I'M PRETTY SURE EVERYBODY HAS TO HAVE THAT MOSTLY EVERY DAY. EXCEPT IN THAT TO AND I COMPETE WITH COMPANIES THAT. AND FARMS THAT ARE IN CALIFORNIA AND I'M STRUGGLING. I'LL JUST BE HONEST WITH YOU ALSO HAVE A TRUCKING BUSINESS. AND I'VE BEEN IMPACTED BY I BELIEVE THE BIGGEST TAX PUT ON CALIFORNIA'S INDUSTRY. WHICH WAS AB THIRTY TWO NOW I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU THAT I AM ALL FOR. CARBONITE I THINK WE SHOULD REDUCE OUR- CARBON FOOTPRINT I THINK WE SHOULD REDUCE POLLUTION I THINK THAT THE PEOPLE THAT LIVE IN COMMUNITIES THAT ARE IMPACTED I WANT TO HELP THEM. BUT I THINK IT'S HOW WE GO ABOUT IT. IT'S THE PRIORITY OF HOW WE SPEND THE DOLLARS THAT HAVE BEEN. BASICALLY TAXED OR ARE FORCED TO PAY FOR THEIR MISSIONS. AND I BROUGHT UP SEVERAL TIMES IN AND I THINK THE PUBLIC IS CATCHING ON TO THIS STUFF. BUT THE FACT THAT WE SPEND. HUGE AMOUNT OF DOLLARS ON TRANSPORTATION A TRAIN THAT WE'RE BUILDING THAT I'VE IN MY MIND I BELIEVE WILL NEVER BE COMPLETED. AND THAT'S THAT'S THE FRUSTRATION AND I HEARD- MR BLUMENFELD SAY THAT YOU KNOW THE CONNIE GREW BY TWENTY SIX PERCENT. AND WE'RE LEADING THE WORLD AND HOW WE DO. YOU KNOW CARBON REDUCTION BUT I'D LIKE TO KNOW WHERE THE ECONOMY GREW DID IT GROWTH PACIFIC LEE FROM. OUR CARBON GOALS OR DID IT GROW BECAUSE WE HAVE A- AND MEGA AMOUNT OF WORLD CORPORATIONS THAT PAY. IN CAPITAL GAINS TAX THAT'S IF YOU LOOK AT THE BUDGET AND FIND OUT WHERE THE MONEY COMES FROM THERE ACTUALLY- THAT HE PUT OUT A REPORT THAT SEVEN THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED TAXPAYERS PAID VERY WEALTHY PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA THAT ARE GETTING CAPITAL GAINS SO I'M VERY MUCH CONCERNED ABOUT THE ECONOMY- AND THE LONG TERM- LOOKING OF- THE LONG TERM EFFECTS OF THE DECISIONS THAT WE MAKE HERE. AND SO I THAT'S THE COMMENT I WANT TO MAKE AYE AYE I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW. YOU KNOW. I THINK THAT WAS THE PROFESSOR THAT SAID EVIDENCE BASED POLICY. AND THE MATRIX IS VERY IMPORTANT IN TWENTY TWENTY TWO I'M GONNA BE LOOKING THIS MATRIX WE DON'T COULD WILDFIRE WE'RE LYING TO OURSELVES IS SAYING HEY WORRY REDUCE EMISSIONS WERE NOT WE BURKE FOUR MILLION EIGHT. FOUR POINT TWO MILLION ACRES LAST YEAR. HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS ACRES EVERY YEAR. PAST THAT AND WE'RE GONNA BURN MORE AND WE KEEP TALKING ABOUT. TRANSPORTATION WHEN WE AND I KNOW WE THE LEGISLATURE HAD TO FORCE. BY LEGISLATION SB NINE ONE WHICH I WAS A BIG PLAYER IN TO GET T DONE TO ACTUALLY DO SOMETHING IN CARBON REDUCTION ON FUELS. AND I'VE SAID IT IN THIS COMMITTEE EARLIER. LOOK THERE'S THREE THINGS THAT CAUSE WILDFIRE OXYGEN IGNITION AND FUEL. IF THE ONE THING WE CAN CONTROL IS FUEL WE NEED TO REDUCE THE FUEL LOADING IN OUR WATERSHEDS. IF WE'RE GOING TO REDUCE CARBON AND IF NOT IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT YOU DO. WE'RE GONNA BURN. SO I'M ON BOARD I THINK THE WAY WE DO IT IS THE PROBLEM IS THAT WE NEED TO FOCUS ON GETTING TAKING CARE OF OUR WATERSHEDS WHICH IS OUR WILL OUR QUOTE WATER QUALITY IN OUR WILDLIFE IS PROTECTED WHEN WE DO THAT AS WELL. I WANTED TO TOUCH ON ONE LAST THING AND THEN I'LL BE HAPPY TO SEE. LISTEN BACK ABOUT WHAT'S IT AND I THINK IT'S WRONG THAT WE HAVE THESE EXECUTIVE ORDERS THAT ARE. ARE WHICH I THINK RUN CONSTITUTIONAL UNDER THE STATE OF EMERGENCY THE GOVERNOR'S DONE EXECUTIVE ORDERS. TO GET US TO TWENTY THIRTY FIVE WITH ALL ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES. THAT'S GREAT NO PROBLEM BUT HOW WE GONNA GET THERE AND STILL HAVE AN ECONOMY AT THE END OF THE DAY HOW MY GONNA RUN MY FORM AND HOW MY NEIGHBOR'S GONNA RUN THEIR FARMS ON ZERO MISSION IF ISSUES BY TWENTY THIRTY FIVE. TELL ME HOW WE'RE GOING TO GET THERE AND THEN. I'LL DECIDE WHETHER I'M GONNA STAY IN CALIFORNIA OR NOT BECAUSE OF A LOT OF BUSINESSES OUT THERE THEY'RE GOING IS A GREAT IDEA AND EVERY FEELS GOOD ABOUT IT. WE DO POLICY AROUND HERE ON FEELING GOOD NOT. FACTUAL MATRIX WHICH I HEARD. IN EVIDENCE BASED POLICIES. IT'S ALL BE CRITICAL OF THOSE WE ASKED. SHARE NICHOLS FIVE YEARS AGO WHAT ABOUT FOREST FIRES AND YOUR ANSWER WAS THAT'S A NATURAL DISASTER WE DON'T COUNT THAT. THAT'S WRONG I'M BREATHING NOT SMOKE EVERY YEAR AND SEWER ALL THE CONSTITUENTS OUT THERE AND THEY'RE GETTING TIRED OF HEARING HEY WE'RE GOING TO DO SOMETHING BUT ALL THEY'RE DOING IS REGULATING THIS AREA. AND NOT FOCUSING ON A HUGE EMITTER. AND ON TOP OF THAT WE'RE SPENDING MONEY ON THE TRAINING THAT DOESN'T GET US ANYTHING AND IT'S BILLIONS OF DOLLARS I THINK THAT WE'RE GONNA THE PEOPLE ARE GONNA WAKE UP TO THIS I HOPE. AND THROW PEOPLE OUT OFFICE THAT ARE MAKING BAD DECISIONS. AGAIN I WANT TO CAP OFFICE SAYING IN CLOSING THAT I AM FOR. A GOOD SOLID CLIMATE POLICY THAT MAKES SOME SENSE THAT ACTUALLY DOES SOMETHING THAT HELPS. CALIFORNIANS BREATHE CLEANER AND WE STOP EMITTING IF WE'RE GOING TO BE THE LEADER IN THE WORLD AND MUST BE THE LEADER IN THE RIGHT WAY AND LET'S BE TRANSPARENT ABOUT IT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. MISPRICED YOUR THIS I THANK YOU JUST SO WE'RE ALL CLEAR CENTER STERN CENTER MCGUIRE CENTER MINING NOW RETIRED MYSELF THIS SUB COMMITTEE WAS THE FIRST SUB COMMITTEE THAT CAME UP WITH THE TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR. OF FUNDING FOR WILDFIRE PREVENTION AND THAT WAS INCORPORATED IN A FIVE YEAR PLAN FOR NINE A ONE SO THERE'S SOME HOPE THAT THE OVERSIGHT HEARINGS THAT WE DO TODAY HERE AND THE HARD QUESTIONS THAT WE HAVE A WE ASK HAVE ARE THE NUCLEUS WHENEVER NOBODY KNOWS EXCEPT FOR THE ANELISTS OF THE PEOPLE OUT THERE IN TV LAND- CENTER STERN YOU HAVE YOUR HAND UP. THE FLOOR YOUR WEIGHT ARE THE PANELISTS ANY COMMENTS ON. OR THOUGHTS ON A CENTER DOLLIES- SUPPORT OF MATRIX AND PRIORITIZING- OUR SPENDING PLAN TO GET THE DEEP CARBONIZATION. YEAH GERMAN HELP FROM CALLIE PA JUST- TERMS AS SENATOR DOLLY OF FESTIVAL THANK YOU FOR THAT WHAT YOU ENDED ON WHICH IS HE YOU KNOW THE GOAL OF MOVING FORWARD ON A MATRIX BASED COMMONSENSE APPROACH TO- TO HERITAGE'S GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS I THINK THAT'S EVERYONE'S GOAL- AND FRANKLY HAVING THAT BIPARTISAN. FOCUS WE MAY ISAGREE ON ON WAYS OF ACHIEVING IT BUT HAVING THAT THAT BIPARTISAN FOCUS TO BEGIN WITH I THINK IT'S BEEN WHAT'S HOW CALIFORNIA IT IS FAR AS IT HAS- INTENDED JUST WANT ONE ELEMENT WHICH WAS THE EXECUTIVE ORDER THAT- IT WAS NOT TAKEN UNDER THE EMERGENCY ORDERS THAT EXIST ON THAT BECAUSE OF IT IS THE GENERAL AUTHORITY OF THE GOVERNOR TO ISSUE EXECUTIVE ORDERS AND THEN. JUST ON THE ON THE POINT ABOUT- IT'S OUR ABILITY TO ACHIEVE THAT I'M GENERAL MOTORS- TWO WEEKS AGO CAME OUT WITH A GOAL WHICH IS THAT OLDER VEHICLES SOLD. I'M ACROSS GM WILL BE A 100% ZERO EMISSIONS BY TWENTY THIRTY FIVE THE W. HAS HAD A GOAL OF TWENTY TWENTY SEVEN TO SELL ITS LAST INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE BUT THE POINT THAT I WANT TO MAKE TO YOU AND- HOW THE FOLKS IN AGRICULTURAL AND OTHER AREAS IS. A SALES MANDATE SO IT'S SAYING TO THE COMPANIES BY TWENTY THIRTY FIVE USUAL AT LEAST SELL. ELECTRIC VEHICLES SO THE ENTIRE FLEET OF VEHICLES THAT ARE RUNNING I MEAN YOU COULD BUY IN IN TWENTY THIRTY FULL AN INTERNAL COMBUSTION VEHICLE- YOU COULD BUY ONE NOW AND STILL DRIVE IT IN TWENTY FORTY SEVEN M. IT JUST TO BE REALLY CLEAR IT IS NOT A. PROHIBITION ON PEOPLE DRIVING. HELLO VEHICLES IN TWENTY THIRTY EIGHT NANA THE INTO THIRTY IT'S VERY- THE MANUFACTURE HAE NOT. TO SELL AND THE LAST THING I WANTED TO SAY ADAM. IS JUST A BIG THANK YOU TO YOU AND AGRICULTURE IN GENERAL- YOU HAVE DONE AN INCREDIBLE JOB IN PARTNERSHIP WITH A R. B. AND US. ON REDUCING EMISSIONS- AND AS WE'LL TALK ABOUT WITH THE PHAM A PROGRAM. WHEN DEPUTY SECRETARY LEARN SANCHEZ GOES TO THE BUDGET- THOSE PROGRAMS TO REALLY HELP CLEAN UP THE AIR IN PLACES LIKE THE SAN JOAQUIN AND SOUTH BECAUSE OF. FARMERS IN AGRA BEEN A TREMENDOUS TREMENDOUS. PADA AND SUPPORTER AN INNOVATOR AND THINKING ABOUT HOW WE REDUCE AB POLLUTION I JUST WANTED TO APPRECIATE YOU FOR THAT. CENTER CALLING. I THANK YOU FOR THOSE COMMENTS I WANTED TO JUST ADD. ONE LAST THING THAT JUST CAME TO MIND IS THAT. DO WHEN WILL WE START PUTTING. THE ADMISSIONS OF FOREST FIRE IN OUR CALCULATION. RIGHT NOW WE DON'T DO THAT I BELIEVE WE DON'T CALCULATE. THE MISSIONS THAT COME OFFOF FIRE INTO THE CLIMATE ACTION PLAN WE AT LEAST WE DIDN'T ON UNDER THE LAST COPING ARE YOU PLANNING ON. IN THIS SCOPING PERIOD TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE AMOUNT OF MISSIONS THAT ARE- RELEASED UNDER FORCE FIRE. DETERMINING THAT- INPUT INTO DISCUSSING PLAN WILL BE PART OF THE PROCESS GOING FORWARD. THAT'S A STRAWBERRY B. YES YES IT WAS I DIDN'T WAS THAT A YES OR NO MAYBE OKAY. WE WILL EXAMINE THAT QUESTION. WELL I ATTEMPTED TO RUN A BILL TO HAVE THAT HAPPEN AND IT HASN'T BEEN SUCCESSFUL- SO DO WE DO THINK WE NEED LEGISLATION TO. GIVE SOME DIRECTION. WELL I GUESS I WOULD SAY- IT. YOU KNOW WE ARE REGULATORY PROCESS REALLY IS ABOUT AND GETTING ALL OF THE- INPUT AND- ARGUMENTS FOR AND AGAINST VARIOUS DECISIONS THAT WE'RE GOING TO MAKE IN THAT PROCESS AND SO THAT IS- OUR PLAN GOING FORWARD. SO WOULD YOU AGREE THAT- FOREST FIRES ARE. A BIG PROBLEM OF OUR- EMISSIONS FOR CLIMATE CHANGE. THAT YOU KNOW FOREST FIRES ARE CRITICAL ISSUE AND- IT IS. AS SECRETARY BLUMENFELD MENTION IT'S YOU KNOW ADDRESSING ISSUES RELATED TO NATURAL AND WORKING LANDS IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF OUR AS COPING PLANNED AND ALICE'S AND DISCUSSION. MISTER CHAIR I WONDER IF I MIGHT OFFER A QUICK RESPONSE THE CENTER DIALING PLEASE PROFESSOR SAN CENTER I JUST WANTED TO AFFIRM YOUR YOUR- ASSERTION THE POOREST EMISSIONS FIRE MISSIONS ARE NOT INCLUDED IN TODAY'S INVENTORY. AS OF CARBS MOST RECENT DRAFT EMISSIONS REPORT EMISSIONS FROM THE TWENTY TWENTY FIRES WHICH ARE UNLIKE ANYTHING ANY OF US EVER LIVE THROUGH. WERE SLIGHTLY OVER A HUNDRED MILLION TONS OF CARBON DIOXIDE IT'S ABOUT TRIPLE THE WORST FIRE SEASON BEFORE THAT. I'M AND IT'S ABOUT ONE THIRD OF THE COVERAGE OF THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM AN ANNUAL BASIS AS TO THE POLICY DECISIONS THE BOARD MIGHT TAKE IN THE FUTURE I'LL JUST FLAG. THE DISCUSSION AROUND- GOVERNOR BROWN'S CARBON NEUTRALITY EXECUTIVE ORDER FOR TWENTY FORTY FIVE WHICH I HEARD THE SECRETARY AND CURRENT CHAIR SAY WOULD BE PART OF THE NEXT COUPLE PLAN PROCESS. I DON'T THINK ONE CAN TALK ABOUT CARBON NEUTRALITY WITHOUT THINKING COMPREHENSIVELY ABOUT BOTH THE CARBON BENEFITS AND EMISSIONS CONCERNS RELATED TO NATURAL WORKING LANDS INCLUDING FORESTS. SO I WOULD CERTAINLY HOPE THAT THIS BECOMES PART OF THE CONVERSATION EVEN THOUGH I WOULD BE SOMEBODY WHO WOULD SAY WE OUGHT TO MANAGE OUR ENERGY SYSTEM IN OUR LAND SYSTEMS WITH DIFFERENT GOALS AND DIFFERENT STRATEGIES WHERE PERHAPS YOU MIGHT HAVE A DIFFERENT POINT OF VIEW BUT I DO THINK EVENTUALLY THOSE CONVERSATIONS HAVE TO COME TOGETHER. NOT FOR THE REASONS YOU SUGGESTED. THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR THAT COMMENT I AGREE- THAT THEY'RE TWO DIFFERENT POTS BUT THEY THEY DO- STILL OF. THERE'S A HUGE AMOUNT OF MISSIONS AND- I'LL BE LOOKING FORWARD TO READING YOUR BOOK BY THE WAY. THERE ISN'T THAT THERE IS A NICE PIECE ON. NPR THIS MORNING WHEN I WAS DRIVING UP ABOUT PROFESSOR BURDON AND STANFORD TALKING ABOUT. TODAY THERE'S ABOUT SIXTY DAYS WERE THE POLLUTION FROM WILDFIRES AS- IT GOES OFF THE CHARTS COMPARED TO A DECADE AGO WHEN IT WAS LIKE THREE OR FOUR. AND THAT'S NOT A COVERED ENTITY. WE HAVEN'T EVEN STARTED THE PATTY. THE ANNUAL TARGETS FROM THE SCOPING PLAN VERSUS THE CAME OF TARGETS A CAP AND TRADE AND THAT'S IN OUR REPORT. CENTER STERN EUROPE. SANDERSON GO AHEAD WITH YOUR QUESTION OKAY THANKS MISTER CHAIR- APPRECIATE THE DISCUSSION I KNOW I KNOW WE'RE- CONSISTENTLY TALKING ABOUT CAP AND TRADE RIGHT NOW BUT- I APPRECIATE THE WIDE RANGING. REDUCE FLUID NATURE OF THE CONVERSATION- AND IT IT ONLY UNDERSCORES FOR ME I GUESS WHAT- ALEJO POINTED OUT TO BEGIN WITH WHICH IS THAT. THERE'S A BROADER FRAMEWORK AND- I THINK THIS REGULATION GETS A LOT OF ATTENTION BUT I APPRECIATE THE THAT THE LAST DISCUSSION ON THE ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE PIECE AND SOME OF OUR TRANSPORTATION GOALS THAT- REALLY ARE VERY DIFFERENT FUNCTION IN THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM AND- AND I DON'T THINK THERE'S GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE ORDER. HAS RECEIVED NEARLY- THE ATTENTION- OR- OR FOCUS THAT IT DESERVES IN THAT. AT THE TRAP. RIGHT NOW. FOR THE MIDDLE CLASS AND FOR PEOPLE STRUGGLING IN POVERTY IS OFTEN ASSOCIATED WITH THE TRAP THAT THEY'RE IN WITH THEIR VEHICLE FOR DRIVERS FOR SUPER COMMUTERS AROUND THE STATE FOR WORKING PEOPLE WHO ARE STRUGGLING THROUGH THIS PANDEMIC- YOU KNOW THEY'RE SPENDING MORE THAN HALF THEIR INCOME SOME OF THE DATA WE'VE BEEN LOOKING AT. SHOWS THAT HOUSEHOLD SPENDING MORE ON TRANSPORTATION THEN FOOD AND HEALTH CARE COMBINED RIGHT IN THE HEART OF A PANDEMIC YOUR SPENDING NO INCOME DISPOSABLE INCOME OR TAKING THEIR EDT CHECK AND THEN HAVING TO BUY GAS AND FIX THEIR CAR TO GET AROUND KEEP THEMSELVES ALIVE. THE TRANSPORTATION IS TRULY A- JUST LIKE POWER AT A MATTER OF LIFE AND DEATH FOR MANY PEOPLE AND I THINK IT UNDERESTIMATES WHEN WE WHEN WE THINK ABOUT OUR GOALS AT I. JUST WANT TO. POINT OUT THAT THIS TRANSPORTATION EMPHASIS THAT WE'RE SEEING HERE AND FOCUSING ON CALIFORNIA'S A MARKET MOVER IS NOT A NEW THING. HI YOU KNOW BACK IN TWO THOUSAND TWO THERE IS A BILL CALLED AB FOURTEEN NINETY THREE THAT SAID THERE RESOURCES BOARD SHOULD EXPLORE ALL COST EFFECTIVE IN TECHNOLOGICALLY FEASIBLE EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS FROM THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR FROM THE AUTOMOTIVE SECTOR. FOR LIGHT DUTIES PARTICULARLY AND- NOW WE ARE GOING TO HAVE AN ELECTRIC F. ONE FIFTY COMING OUT. THEY CAN PULL LIKE FIFTY TRAIN CARS OF TORQUE AND- THE- VERY POLITE TO THE SECTOR IS GOING TO BE- ACCESSIBLE BY A WHOLE NEW GENERATION OF MIDDLE CLASS AMERICANS AND- YOU KNOW WHEN YOU HAVE A- MONTHLY VEHICLE BUDGET. SAY TWENTY FIVE OR THIRTY DOLLARS TO FILL UP YOUR CAR AND MAINTAINING. FORTY DOLLARS VERSUS. FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS ARE YOU FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGE THE ECONOMICS OF. HOUSEHOLDS IN THIS STATE SO I ACTUALLY THINK IT'S A POVERTY FIGHTING TOOL AND I THINK IT WILL UNLOCK PEOPLE'S DISPOSABLE INCOME TO TAKE CARE OF THEIR HEALTH AND THEIR KIDS- AND I. I REALLY WANT TO KEEP OUR OURSELVES FOCUSED ON THAT IN THE LEGISLATURE THIS YEAR AS WE LOOK AT THESE AMBITIOUS GOALS. ANYTHING MY BIGGEST CONCERN HERE IS THAT THE LEGISLATURE ITSELF HAS NOT BEEN AMBITIOUS ENOUGH. AND THAT THIS ADMINISTRATION IS DOING WHAT IT CAN TO MOVE THE PUSH THE ENVELOPE. AND TO RESPOND WITH. WITH URGENCY- ON THINGS LIKE SAID CERTAIN NO ONE TARGETING CARBON NEUTRALITY IS A LONG TERM GOAL BUT ALSO UNITE I DON'T THINK. CARBON NEUTRALITY IS GOING TO BE ENOUGH. AND I FRANKLY THINK IT'S- A BIT OF AN ARBITRARY. GOAL GETTING TO ZERO SOUNDS GOOD OR YOU KNOW NEUTRALITY I GUESS SORT OF THIS TAKEN HOLD BUT IF YOU. IF THE-TRUE GOAL IS TO REVERSE THESE TRENDS AND TRY TO KEEP THESE FOREST FROM BURNING AS- A CENTER DOLLY SO. APTLY POINTED OUT AND YOU KNOW IN OUR MY COMMUNITIES BURNED TO AN- ARE WE LOST A LOT OURSELVES. BUT IF WE CAN ACTUALLY REVERSE OUR HISTORIC TRENDS. AND GET TO A PLACE OF CLIMATE RESTORATION. FORGET NEUTRALITY BUT ACTUALLY GET TO NEGATIVE EMISSIONS AND START REMOVING CARBON DIOXIDE WE WON'T BE ABLE TO CATCH UP IT'S GOING TO BE TOO LATE. NO STATE'S GOING TO BE ON FIRE THIS IS JUST THE BEGINNING. SO I YOU KNOW. I DO WANT TO SORT OF POINT OUT THAT. THE DANGER IN THE LEGISLATURE THIS YEAR IS TO. IS TO JUST SPEND TIME SORT OF. LOOKING FOR HOLES IN CRITICIZING BUT NOT TO TAKE BIG LEAPS THAT WE NEED TO TAKE. THE SET IS THE MINISTRATIONS TARGET ON A FURTHER HORIZON AND IF THIS BY ADMINISTRATION IS ACTUALLY GONNA OUTPACE CALIFORNIA. IN TERMS OF SETTING ITS ITS TARGETS AND AMBITIONS- WE'VE GOT SOME CATCHING UP TO DO EUROPE IS IT 55% BELOW NINETEEN NINETY LEVELS. BY TWENTY THIRTY WE'RE ONLY A 40% OUR GOALS ARE MUCH LESS THAN THE U. K. AND MANY OTHER. NATIONS ARE ACTUALLY WITH SMALLER SMALLER AGGREGATE ECONOMIES IN OURS PERHAPS- BUT BUT COLLECTIVELY THE E. U. FOUR DOOR SARS- SO I'M I'M CONCERNED THAT THE PLANNING EXERCISE GOING ON RIGHT NOW FRANKLY IS NOT AMBITIOUS ENOUGH AND THAT THE MODELING EFFORTS. UNDER WAY THEY WILL DRIVE THIS SCOPING PLAN. ARE GOING TO SORT OF SHOOT FOR. I YOU KNOW THESE THESE THESE NUMBERS WE'VE CHOSEN AND LORET EXECUTIVE ORDER BUT NOT PURSUE ALL COST EFFECTIVE TECHNOLOGICALLY FEASIBLE GOALS- SOME WONDERING IF EITHER L. A. O. OR AND MAYBE AND THE ADMINISTRATION CAN CAN COMMENT ON. HOW HOW MUCH WE'RE POTENTIALLY LEAVING ON THE TABLE RIGHT NOW- IF WE DON'T PLAN BIG IF WE IF WE SORT OF INCREMENTALLY INVEST FOR INSTANCE RIGHT NOW- AND ANY SORT OF JUST PLAN FOR THAT FORTY PERCENT. BUT DON'T GO BEYOND IT- IS THERE A RISK THAT WE LEAVE A NUMBER OF COST EFFECTIVE INVESTMENTS- ON THE TABLE TO THE PRIVATE SECTOR MAY ALREADY FIND TO BE COST EFFECTIVE BUT WE'RE NOT PURSUING THEM. WHO'D LIKE TO TAKE THE FIRST CRACK AT THAT I'M I'M REMINDED OF- THE END OF PROFESSOR CALLING WERE WORDS BOOK THAT SAID YOU KNOW DEEP CARBONIZATION MUST BE EARNED THE OLD FASHIONED WAY. THROUGH INDUSTRIAL POLICY INVESTMENT EXPERIMENTATION AND SCALING OUR- THUNDERSTORM RAISES A GOOD POINT POINT ABOUT AMBITION AND THIS THE CRITIQUE THAT SOME PEOPLE DON'T THINK WE'LL GET TO MAKE THE FORTY PERCENT. FIFTY A TARGET THAT WE HAVE THAT'S THAT'S LESS THAN EUROPEANS. LET'S SEE. WHO'S WAVING THEIR HAND- MR SHARE THIS IS ROSS FROM LA I CAN KIND OF TAKE A STEP AND I RESPONDED TO SOME OF THOSE COMMENTS THAT'S OKAY WITH YOU- YEAH I MEAN I THINK YOU KNOW. A LOT OF THE COMMENTS HE MADE SENATOR STERN REALLY SORT OF RELATE TO YOU KNOW THE LEGISLATURE'S GOAL AND SORT OF WHAT WHAT TYPES OF AMBITIONS THE LEGISLATURE HAS FOR SORT OF ITS LONG TERM CLIMATE GOALS WE HAVE THAT AS YOU MENTIONED THAT TWENTY THIRTY. GOAL IN STATUTES- I THINK THERE ARE KIND OF IMPORTANT QUESTIONS ABOUT YOU KNOW TO WHAT EXTENT DOES THE LEGISLATURE SUPPORT KIND OF THOSE LONGER TERM GOALS AND HOW AMBITIOUS DOESN'T WANT TO BE OUT OF TWENTY THIRTY BUT ALSO SORT OF BEYOND THAT. AND DEPENDING ON KIND OF WHERE YOU STAND ON I'M KIND OF THAT LEVEL OF AMBITION. IT CAN MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE AND SORT OF WHAT TYPES OF POLICIES YOU MIGHT. WANT TO ADOPT IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THOSE GOALS SO. YOUNG MID TERM TARGET YOU KNOW MIGHT- UP TO TWENTY THIRTY- YOU MIGHT KIND OF LOOK AT A CERTAIN SET OF POLICIES TO TRY TO ACHIEVE THAT YOU KNOW 40% REDUCTION UP TO TWENTY THIRTY. BUT IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT REALLY A MORE AMBITIOUS LONG TERM GOALS IN PARTICULAR. YOU MIGHT THINK ABOUT KIND OF A DIFFERENT STRATEGY FOR ACHIEVING THOSE LONG TERM GOALS AND NOT NECESSARILY SORT OF THE SAME SET OF ALL SEASON STRATEGIES OR CAN WE DO NOT NEED. A LONG TERM GOAL. I APOLOGIZE IF YOU'RE HEARING SOME. NOISE OUTSIDE. MY WINDOW. I THINK I JUST HAD A LOAD TRUCK MISTER. SO I YOU KNOW. YOU GET TO HAVE A- I DON'T KNOW LEAVE BLOWER YEAH. SO- I'M SORRY I YOUR POINT IS RIGHT ON BUT I MEAN IT YOU KNOW IN THE END THEY'RE SORT OF THE THERE'S A- A DIFFICULT BALANCING ACT I KNOW THAT YOU'LL YOU'LL HAVE TO KIND OF WRESTLE WITH THEM TRYING TO KIND OF. SORT OUT BOTH THE AND THE AMBITION BUT ALSO SORT OF THE COST OF MEETING THOSE GOALS- ANSWER THE MIX OF POLICIES THAT ARE- KIND OF- BEST ABLE TO MEET THOSE GOALS IN A COST EFFECTIVE WAY I GUESS ONE OTHER THING. I DO WANT TO MENTION AND I THINK YOU KIND OF. TOUCHED ON THIS- AS WELL IS I GUESS WHEN THINKING ABOUT THE MIX OF POLICIES AND KIND OF WHERE THE STATE WANTS TO GO AND HOW AMBITIOUS IT WANTS TO BE. IN ITS LEADERSHIP ROLE THINKING ABOUT WHICH POLICIES DO KIND OF HAVE THAT THE BIGGEST IMPACTS AND KIND OF. YOU KNOW WHAT WILL BE ADOPTED OTHER JURISDICTIONS. FOR EXAMPLE WHAT TECHNOLOGIES MIGHT CALIFORNIA BE ABLE TO PUSH THAT ARE LIKELY TO BE ADOPTED IN OTHER JURISDICTIONS AND HAVE THAT KIND OF. A BIGGER- IMPACT AND INFLUENCE OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA- IT COULD BE SORT OF IN AND OUT POLICY DEMONSTRATION CONTACTS MAYBE CALIFORNIA CAN SORT OF DEMONSTRATE HOW TO. IMPLEMENT CERTAIN POLICIES OR KIND OF YOU KNOW HOW TO DESIGN CERTAIN POLICIES IN A WAY THAT THAN OTHER JURISDICTIONS CAN LEARN FROM- WE THINK THOSE ARE KIND OF VERY IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS AND THINKING ABOUT. HOW CAN CALIFORNIA HOUSE- HAVE THE GREATEST IMPACTS AND KIND OF YOU KNOW THAT IN THE CLIMATE CHANGE WORLD AT LEAST. THINKING ABOUT KIND OF SOME OF THOSE BIGGER PICTURE QUESTIONS AND WORKING KIND OF CALIFORNIA DEMONSTRATE OTHER JURISDICTIONS OR SORT OF INFLUENCE WHAT OTHER JURISDICTIONS ARE GOING SO. THOSE ARE- I THINK MY SORT OF INITIAL COMMENTS BUT THE OTHERS ARE YOUR. COMMENTS ARE ARE. OR SORT OF VERY CRITICAL KIND OF THE- BIG PICTURE BY. ABOUT THE STATE'S GOING. HAPPY TO- CAN TO THE CONVERSATION AROUND. D. THE CONCLUSION OF OUR STAFF REPORT TALKS ABOUT THIS. MOMENT IN TIME WE HAVE A NEW CHAIR AT SAID. OPPORTUNE MOMENT TO DO THE SECRETARY BLUMENFELD YOU HAD YOUR HAND UP. THANK YOU CHAD- I WOULD JUST SAY. AS TO MAINLY TO SENATOR STAND I WAS OUT WITH THE GOVERNMENT- AND AS SIGNATURE NATURAL RESOURCES ON THE DAY AFTER THE ORANGE KIND OF APOCALYPTIC SKY- BLANKETED MUCH OF THE BAY AREA AND HE SAID. THAT SAME CONCERN ABOUT AMBITION- AND BASICALLY SAID. WE NEED TO GO BACK AND LOOK AT EVERY SINGLE POLICY AND UNDERSTAND CAN WE ACCELERATE IT- HALF HOW AN WE DO THAT AND SECONDLY WHAT AREAS ARE WE NOT CURRENTLY LOOKING AT THAT WE NEED TO CITING. I'M FROM THE HIGHEST LEVEL IN THE ADMINISTRATION THAT THAT BOND TO DECLINE IS SHED IN ADDITION IF YOU LOOK AT THE SB ONE HUNDRED GOAL. THAT THE BY THE DEMONISATION PUT OUT ITS TWENTY THIRTY FIVE HOUSES TWENTY FORTY FIVE- WE REALLY NEED TO LOOK AT WHAT WE'RE DOING HOW WE'RE DOING AND HOW WE'RE GOING TO ACHIEVE THAT- IN IN EVERY SINGLE SECTOR- YOU KNOW WE GOTTA HAVE PLACE I THINK WHERE. WE HAD MORE THAN A HUNDRED LAWSUITS AGAINST THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION WE ARE MY HEADSPACE CERTAINLY HAS HAD TO CHANGE IN THE LAST MONTH FROM A PLACE WHERE IT'S VERY DEFENSIVE. AND WE'RE REALLY- DEALING WITH ENORMOUS HEADWINDS TO WE GOT TAILWINDS NOW LIKE WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO HOW WE GONNA DO IT HOW WE CAN I THINK ABOUT IT DIFFERENTLY- BECAUSE THE SIZE IS ALSO AS AS DANNY AND OTHERS WE'RE GONNA AND LIANG CAN CAN. ATTEST THIS IS YOUR SHOWING THE IMMEDIACY OF WHAT WE NEED TO DO IT RIGHT WE REALLY AT. I THINK THE WILDFIRES- THE FLIP SIDE THAT SIDE OF THE WILDFIRES IS A LOT OF IT WAS CALLED BY DROUGHT. I'M AND DEAD TREES- FROM BEATLES NOW THE INFESTATIONS THAT WERE CRIME RELATED WE YOU KNOW BOTH THE WILD FIRS THEMSELVES BUT WHY THAT BECAUSE I'M ON THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND WE GET INTO THE SEA LEVEL RISE FLOODING ATMOSPHERIC RIVERS- YEAH WAY I'M VERY WORRIED ABOUT US MOVING INTO THE DROUGHT AND DRY WEATHER CONDITIONS THIS SUMMER. SO DID THE ALL OF THE ABOVE POLICY WHETHER IT'S WATER RESILIENCY PORTFOLIO ALL OTHER THINGS I'M I'M A 100% ON BOARD REVIEWS AND THAT THE STAND WE NEED WE NEED TO LOOK UNDER EVERY ROCK- UNDERSTAND WHAT WE CAN ACHIEVE HOW WE CAN ACHIEVE IT BECAUSE FRANKLY OF CALIFORNIA'S NOT DOING IT. OTHER PLACES AROUND THE WORLD ALL IN STATE WE CAN WAIT THIS WELLS THAT WE THAT LEAD. ROLE WE NEED TO PLAY AN I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE- AND THE ENTIRE LED. TO GET THAT DONE. FIVE YES. VERY QUICK RAISE AN EXAM- OF THIS APPROACH IS IN THE- SB ONE HOW RIVER THAT THE- AT PC ENERGY COMMISSION AND CARBS- WORKED ON ALL LAST YEAR IT WILL BE TRANSMITTED TO THE LEGISLATURE SHORTLY- WHERE WE DID THE- PART OF THE ANALYSIS WAS TAKING A LOOK AT- IF WE WERE TO MOVE BEYOND THE SPECIFIC STATUTORY GOAL IN SB ONE HUNDRED AND WHAT MIGHT SOME DIFFERENT SCENARIOS- FOR ELECTRICITY SALES- THAT WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO LOOK AT AND- AND WHAT THE VARIOUS- AND- IMPACTS OF. OF MOVING BEYOND JUST THE STATUTORY MANDATE WOULD BE SO THAT'S AN EXAMPLE WHERE WE DID TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY TO- RIGHT OUT SOME SCENARIOS BEYOND THE LEGAL LANGUAGE OF THE STATUTE. OKAY LET'S CONTINUE OUR AMBITIONS. US SENATOR MCGUIRE THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU TO THE PANEL IS PRESENT TODAY I JUST LIKE TO VERY QUICKLY GET TO THE G. G. R. A FORMULA SO IS WE KNOW 60% OF THAT FORMULA IS CONTINUOUSLY APPROPRIATED 40% THEN IT IS SPENT FOR OTHER INVESTMENTS RELATED TO CLIMATE- WHICH MEANS THERE ARE. SIGNIFICANT OTHER NEEDS FOR ADAPTED POLICY INITIATIVES. IN INVESTMENTS LIKE MILES WHAT LIKE WILDFIRE MITIGATION THAT'S BEING CROWDED OUT IN A COUPLE OF STATISTICS. SO WHEN IT CMES TO THE ISSUE OF WILDFIRES IN TWENTY TWENTY. MORE CARBON- WAS GENERATED FROM WILDFIRES IN ANY OTHER ECONOMIC SECTOR IN CALIFORNIA IN TWENTY TWENTY. HUNDRED TWENTY MILLION HUNDRED TWELVE MILLION METRIC TONS IT'S A COLLECT ABOUT TWENTY FOUR MILLION CAR. IN WHAT WE ALSO KNOW AS FIVE OF THE SIX LARGEST WILDFIRES IN OUR HISTORY HAPPENED LAST YEAR LARGEST WILDFIRES IN OUR HISTORY OF ALL TAKING PLACE IN THE LAST DECADE. IN THE CHALLENGE THAT WE SEE TO IT ESPECIALLY WITH CONNOR FOR FORESTS WHICH ARE SOME OF OUR BEST THINKS. IT WILL TAKE NEARLY A CENTURY TO BE ABLE TO RE GROW TO THEIR FULL MATURITY. I IN THE CHALLENGE THAT WE'RE FACED WITH NOW WITH WHILE THEM FIRE IS THAT THIS STATE PROUDLY IS DOING MORE TO COMBAT CLIMATE CHANGE. THAN ANY OTHER STATE IN THIS UNION. BUT THESE WILDFIRES NOW ARE SETTING OUR AMBITIOUS CLIMATE WORK BACK HERE IN THE GOLDEN STATE FULL STOP. SO WE HAVEN'T EVEN GONE INTO THE HEALTH IMPACTS OF WILDFIRE SMOKE IN HOW IT'S IMPACTING TENS OF MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS AND THIS PAST YEAR IT WAS LITERALLY WEEKS AT A TIME WEEKS AT A TIME NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. SO THE G. G. R. F. IS UNSTABLE. IT'S AN UNSTABLE FUNDING SOURCE- DUE TO ITS DESIGN NOW THE CHAIR OF THIS BUDGET SUB COMMITTEE CHAIRED BY CASKEY HAS BEEN VERY FOCUSED- INTONATIONS ARE WANTING BETTER BRING STABILITY. TO THE FORMULA BUT WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO COME TOGETHER TO GET TO DO THAT THIS YEAR. CANDIDLY FOR US NOT TO COMMIT THAT WE'RE GONNA TAKE WILDFIRE SMOKE INTO ACCOUNT I BELIEVE IS A DERELICTION OF DUTY- AND I WOULD LIKE TO BE A TO SEE THE SECRETARY'S STRATEGY THE ADMINISTRATION STRATEGY. TO ENSURE THAT THERE ARE RESOURCES AVAILABLE WITHIN THE G. G. R. F. ABOVE AND BEYOND WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT NOW TO BE A MITIGATE WILDFIRES IN MR SECRETARY APPRECIATE ALL YOUR WORK SIR TRULY. YOU OF THAT COMING IN A VERY CHALLENGING TIME FOR THE STATE BUT IF YOU CAN JUST GIVE US SOME LIGHT. IN REGARDS TO HOW WE CAN MAKE ROOM IN THE G. R. F. TO HELP MITIGATE WILDFIRES WOULD WOULD GREATLY APPRECIATE THAT MR SECRETARY FUTURE CENTER WOULD YOU LIKE FOR HIM TO DEAL WITH THAT THE FUNDING STABILITY QUESTION FIRST AND THEN. BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY WE'VE GOT A GREAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS SOME NEW FEES AND TAXES SOME OTHER IDEAS OF HOW THE FUND CLIMATE PROGRAM SECURITIZATIONS THE FORCES OF MONEY BUT THERE'S A FUNDAMETAL REFORM ON THE STABILITY OF THIS FUN. THAT MIGHT- PERFECT. HELP OUT. SECTOR AS THANK YOU JAZZ THANK YOU SENATOR I'M- I DON'T GET TO A OF OURSELVES BECAUSE WE GOT A PRESENT COMING UP OUT OF THIS ON THE G. CARE ACT BUDGET WAS EXPLICITLY DEALS WITH KIND OF. WHAT FUNDING KIND OF CURRENTLY GOING AND I AND I THINK TO THE SENATE IS FINE AND THAT THE ALLOCATION. WE'VE REALLY PRIORITIZED- A NUMBER OF FACTORS. BUT BASICALLY I AM LOOKING AT EQUITY ECONOMIC RECOVERY AND HEALTH AS THE THREE ELEMENTS THAT THAT WE WANT TO PRIORITIZE THIS LIMITED CHAD STARTED THIS HEARING- CLEARLY ARTICULATING THAT THOSE ARE ISSUES THAT YOU GET TO PROGRAM AND MAKE THE DECISION ON. WE TRIED THROUGH THE DISCIPLINE THAT WE HAVE ALL THIS BUDGET PROCESS TO USE THE LIMITED FUNDING I'M IN A WAY THAT MAXIMIZES ACROSS THE ENTIRE CLIMATE PORTFOLIO WALL WHAT WE CAN DO THAT WOULD OPEN TO OBVIOUSLY HAVING THAT DISCUSSION WITH YOU AND- LOOK FORWARD TO DOING THAT MAYBE IN IN THE NEXT SESSION IT IN I'M I'M ABSOLUTELY FINE WITH THAT AND I THINK THAT MAKES SENSE THAT JUST IF YOU DON'T MIND. JUST MR SECRETARY. YOUR STRATEGY THE ADMINISTRATION STRATEGY ON TO BE ABLE TO FREE UP SOME ADDITIONAL ROOM. A TO HELP MITIGATE FIRES YOU WANT TO COMMENT ON THAT OBVIOUSLY WE CAN GET INTO THE FORMULA INSTABILITY HERE- IN THE NEXT SECTION OF THIS HEARING BUT IF YOU DON'T MIND. JUST TALKING TO US ABOUT YOUR STRATEGY TO BE A FREE UP SOME FUNDING FOR WILDFIRE MITIGATION. DOES AND I THINK THAT IT WAS PRESENTED AT THIS COMMITTEE ALL. PERHAPS I'M BETTER NOW THAT I'M DOES IT BILLION DOLLAR WILDFIRE PROGRAM- THAT. THAT IS IN FRONT OF THE LEGISLATURE FROM. THE GOVERNOR IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET NOT. VERY FAMILIAR WITH THAT BUT MOST OF THAT IS ONE TIME RIGHT. SO THIS IS AN ONGOING CHALLENGE THIS IS A CRISIS IT'S BEEN IN THE STATE FOR TEN YEARS- IT'S GROWING WORSE. SO I I'M VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT WE DID LAST WEEK BUT A LOT OF IT IS ONE TIME FUNDING. OKAY PJ THAT AB. I GUESS THE POINT IS. THE WHAT WE'VE I THINK GOT IN THE TRAP OF AND I THINK HE'LL YOU'LL POINTING OUT IS IF IT'S A G. JARETH LI. FUNDING PLAY I MEAN THE GOVERNOR THAT. THIS IN THIS BUDGET WANTED TO CUT- GENERAL FUND MONEY AND YET IT IS ONE TIME MONEY BUT- THE POINT IS. THERE ISN'T SUFFICIENT MONEY IN THE IN THE G. GERAK IN THE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUND WHICH COMES FROM CAP AND TRADE. REVENUES TO DO NEARLY ANY OF THE THINGS THAT WE NEEDED TO DO THAT IF YOU LOOK AT- ELECTRIC VEHICLES WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT I'M- I THINK THE JAIL WAS TALKING ABOUT. SOME OF THOSE FUNDS IF YOU LOOK AT WILDFIRE. PREVENTION THE MONEY JUST SIMPLY ISN'T THAT SO PART OF THE QUESTION THAT THAT- THAT I THINK YOU'RE RAISING IS ABOUT THEIR CONTINUOUS APPROPRIATIONS MESSES THE NON CONTINUOUS. I'M THERE IS ONLY A 40% THAT'S AVAILABLE- IT'S A REALLY ISN'T A LOT OF. A LOT OF THERE IS VERY LITTLE HEADROOM TO BE ABLE TO MOVE THESE THINGS AROUND I WE TRY. THE BEST THAT WE CAN THROUGH A DISCIPLINED APPROACH TO PRIORITIZE THAT THE G. CARE ACT FUNDING. I'M WE'LL TALK ABOUT HOW WE DID THAT BUT IT ON TO YOUR QUESTION IS THEIR ABILITY TO FREE UP MORE MONEY WITHIN THE G. CARE ACT- I THINK THE ANSWER IS NO. IT YOU KNOW AND I'LL TURN IT BACK TO MISTER TERRY REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR ANSWERS ON THAT IN YOUR HONESTY AND I THINK THAT- LOOK BOTTOM LINE IS. TWENTY SECONDS RESEARCHER IS THAT WE NEED TO LOOK AT THIS FORMULA ONE TO BE A TO BRING MORE STABILITY TO FORMULA AN ADDITIONAL ROOM TO BE A TACKLE SOME OF THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES THAT ARE IMPACTING. BOTH THE CLIMATE AND THE HEALTH OF CALIFORNIANS ARE LOOK FOR TOWARD NEXT TO. A PART OF THE HEARING ON THE DISCUSSION THANK YOU. OKAY- I COULD GO FOR OUR- BUT WE'RE OUT OF TIME- ANYTHING ANY OF THE PANELISTS. LAST SPOTS THAT. ONE TO LEAVE THE- THE- SUBCOMMITTEE WITH- IF NOT WE'LL GO INTO THE EXPENDITURE PLAN HANK YOU EVERYONE FOR BEING HERE JANET VERSIGHT- IMPORTANT IDEAS WILL CONTINUE. HI I KNOW I'M A COUPLE OF PEOPLE. HAVE RESIGNED FROM THE- ONE THE PALACE I'LL BE TALKING DIRECTLY WITH THE AIRPORT ABOUT THE CONCERNS THAT THE RATE OF RACE ON THE OFFSET PROGRAM AND IT'S GOING ON BUT WE'VE WE'VE RUN OUT OF TIME SO WE'LL GET TO THAT LATER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AND WITH THAT WE'LL MOVE ON TO ITEM NUMBER- FIFTEEN WHICH IS THE. VARIOUS PROGRAMS FOR CAP AND TRADE WE HAVE THE CAL ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY THE AIR RESOURCE BOARD CAL FIRE AND- SEDIA FAITH. LET'S START OFF WITH CAL EPA THEN WILL FOLLOW IT UP BY THE- KELLY- AND- THE FINANCE DIRECTOR I BELIEVE WE'RE LOSING SECRETARY BLUMENFELD. LEAVES ME BAY YOU SAID JAY YOU GAIN DEPUTY SECRETARY LAWRENCE CHANGES TO THE PERSON WHO HAS THE UNENVIABLE TASK OF KIND OF BRINGING TOGETHER ALL THESE DIFFERENT ELEMENTS IN THE BUDGET SO SHE'LL GO THROUGH F. I'LL STAY HERE AND QUESTION DO YOU HAVE I LEARNED ALL OF MYSELF OR ANYONE ELSE CAN ONS OF BOBBY. I'M NOT. THE YOU SIR THANK YOU SIR THIRTY SUCH IMPORTANT MATTERS THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS REYES AND THE RESPECT OF THE PUBLIC IT'S HERE IN THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. I SINCERELY APPRECIATE THAT THESE ARE. INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT BUDGET CONSIDERATION SO GO AHEAD DEPUTY. MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK HERE TODAY. AS I MENTIONED MY NAME IS LAUREN SANCHEZ AND I SERVICE DEPUTY SECRETARY FOR CLIMATE POLICY AND INTERGOVERNMENTAL RELATIONS AT THE CALIFORNIA EPA. AS YOU FOR THIS MORNING TWENTY TWENTY WAS AN UNPRECEDENTED YEARS OF ACCELERATING CLIMATE IMPACT IN EVERY CORNER OF OUR STATE FROM RECORD BREAKING HEAT TO DEVASTATING WILDFIRES AS VICE CHAIR DOLLY HAS HIGHLIGHTED. DESPITE THE EXTREME CHALLENGES WE FACE CALIFORNIA CONTINUE TO DEVELOP AND ENFORCE OUR PROGRAMS AIMED AT PROTECTING PUBLIC HEALTH AND THE ENVIRONMENT. WE INSERTED IN A FOCUS ON EQUITY IN ALL OF OUR WORK AND ADVANCE STARTING VICIOUS CLIMBING GOALS WHICH WE'VE BEEN DISCUSSING THIS MORNING. GOVERNOR NEWSOM HAS CONTINUED TO PRIORITIZE OUR CLIMATE ACTION WITH THIS YEAR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL. I KEEP HELLER OF THE PROPOSED CLIMATE BUDGET IS THE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUND EXPENDITURES PLAN I AM PLEASED TO PRESENT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL FOR THE PLAN TODAY. TO DATE THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM HAS GENERATED ALMOST THIRTEEN BILLION DOLLARS IN AUCTION PROCEEDS TO FUND CRITICAL INVESTMENT PROGRAMS. THANKS TO YOUR LEGISLATIVE LEADERSHIP AND DIRECTION TO PRIORITIZE INVESTMENTS IN DISADVANTAGED AND LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES. AS ENVISIONED IN SB FIVE THIRTY FIVE IN AB FIFTEEN FIFTY DIRECTING ROJECTS TOWARDS COMMUNITIES IN NEED IS A KEY OBJECTIVE OF THE FUND. WE CONTINUE TO SET AN EXAMPLE FOR OTHER NATIONAL AND SUBNATIONAL CLIMATE PROGRAMS BY EMPHASIZING COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT. AND EQUITY IN PROGRAM DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION. NOTABLY OF THE SIX POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS HAS ALREADY BEEN LEGISLATIVELY APPROPRIATED AND SPENT ABOUT BENEFITED DISADVANTAGED AND LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES. THE YEAR TWENTY NINETEEN SO OUR SINGLE LARGEST ANNUAL INVESTMENT IN CALIFORNIA'S PRIORITY POPULATIONS TO DATE. THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED EXPENDITURE PLAN INCLUDES ONE POINT FOUR BILLION INCLUDING SEVERAL EARLY ACTIONS FOR FISCAL YEAR TWENTY TWENTY ONE. FOR EXISTING PROGRAMS THAT ADVANCE THE STATE'S PRIORITIES OF ONE EQUITY AN ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE TO PROTECTING PUBLIC HEALTH. AND THREE DRIVING A GREEN ECONOMIC RECOVERY WHILE REDUCING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. THE EXPENDITURE PLAN ALSO ADVANCES THE GOVERNOR'S RECENT EXECUTIVE ORDERS ON ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES AND NATURAL WORKING LANDS. THE PLAN PROPOSES THREE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE MILLION FOR THE COMMUNITY AIR PROTECTION PROGRAM CREATED THROUGH IT AB SIX SEVENTEEN WHICH REDUCES EMISSIONS AND COMMUNITIES WITH DISPROPORTIONATE EXPOSURE TO AIR POLLUTION THROUGH TARGETED MONITORING COMMUNITY EMISSION REDUCTION PROGRAMS AND INCENTIVES GRANTS TO COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND IMPLEMENTATION FUNDING FOR LOCAL AIR DISTRICTS. THE BUDGET ALSO PROPOSES FUNDING FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF SB TWO HUNDRED THE SAFE AND AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER PROGRAM. WHICH IS DESIGNED TO ACHIEVE SUSTAINABLE OPERATIONS FOR DRINKING WATER SYSTEMS AND ENSURE THAT THE ONE MILLION CALIFORNIANS WHO CURRENTLY LACK SAFE DRINKING WATER RECEIVE SAFE AND AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. THE OTHER THESE INVESTMENTS REFLECTS THE ADMINISTRATION'S PRIORITIZATION OF PROTECTING PUBLIC HEALTH IN THE STATE'S MOST VULNERABLE AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. THE PLAN ALSO PROPOSES SIX HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE MILLION DEDICATED TO THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR. THE LARGEST SOURCE OF CALIFORNIA'S GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND THE MAIN DRIVER OF HARMFUL AIR POLLUTION. AND TO SUPPORT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE GOVERNOR'S IO ON STEPS. PROGRAMS INCLUDED IN THIS TRANSPORTATION PACKAGE INCLUDES. HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION FOR EQUITY FOCUSED TRANSPORTATION PROGRAMS WHICH TOGETHER FIND FOR EXAMPLE LOW INCOME CAR SHARING PROGRAMS VANPOOL VAN POOLS FOR AGRICULTURE WORKERS AND SCHOOL BUSES IN RURAL COMMUNITIES. THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN MILLION FOR HEAVY DUTY VEHICLE PROGRAMS INCLUDING INCENTIVES FOR CLEAN TRUCKS BUSES AND OFF ROAD FREIGHT EQUIPMENT THE SO CALLED H. FIT PROGRAM RAN OUT OF FUNDING IN TWO WEEKS AS AN ILLUSTRATION OF HIGH DEMAND FOR THESE INCENTIVES ACROSS THE STATE. AND A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY MILLION FOR THE FARMER PROGRAM WHICH FUNDS CLEANER ADD VEHICLES AND ENGINES. THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY WHICH RECEIVES THE BULK OF FARMER FUNDING HAS OVER TWO HUNDRED MILLION IN PENDING APPLICATIONS TODAY. TURNING OVER OLDER AND HIGHER POLLUTING VEHICLES AND EQUIPMENT AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE IS ESSENTIAL TO PROTECTING PUBLIC HEALTH AS MANY CALIFORNIANS CONTINUE TO SUFFER FROM POOR AIR QUALITY IN OUR DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES HAVE BORNE THE BURDEN THE BURDEN OF POLLUTION FOR TOO LONG. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET FURTHER PROPOSES THE RE AUTHORIZATION OF THE LEGISLATURES ASSEMBLY BILL EIGHT WHICH WOULD PROVIDE FUNDING FOR ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE INFRASTRUCTURE. AND TO CLEAN UP CONSTRUCTION AND AGRICULTURAL EQUIPMENT AND LIGHT AND HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES ON OUR ROADS. THE OTHER WITH THE CONTINUOUSLY APPROPRIATED PROGRAMS WHICH INCLUDE HIGH SPEED RAIL TRANSIT PROJECTS TRANSIT ORIENTED AFFORDABLE HOUSING THE TRANSPORTATION INVESTMENTS RIGHT KEY PILLAR OF THE TRANSITION TO AN EQUITABLE SUSTAINABLE CALIFORNIA FOR ALL. THE ADMINISTRATIONIS NOT PROPOSING CHANGES TO OUR CONTINUOUSLY APPROPRIATED PROGRAMS WHICH ACCOUNT 465% AND FUTURE REFERENCE. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL ALSO REFLECTS OUR COMMITMENT TO BUILDING CLIMATE RESILIENCE THROUGH OUR NATIONAL WORKING LANDS AN URGENTPRIORITY AS HAS BEEN HIGHLIGHTED NUMBER OF TIMES THIS MORNING FOR THE NETWORKING LAND SECTOR IS TO REDUCE THE RISK OF CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRE IN OUR FORESTS. TO PROTECT OUR WET WATERSHEDS AND WILDLIFE AND RESTORE OR WASTE VALUABLE ROLE AS A CARBON SINK. INCLUDED WITHIN THIS PLAN IS THREE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE MILLION IN INVESTMENTS TOWARDS SB NINE A ONE TO SUPPORT WILDFIRE RESILIENCE. AND SUSTAINABLE FORESTRY INCLUDING A HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE MILLION IN EARLY ACTION FUNDING. TO MAKE HOLD THE STATE'S COMMITMENT TO PROVIDING TWO HUNDRED MILLION A YEAR FROM THE TEACHER ASKED. THIS PROVIDES VITAL PROGRAM FOR STATE PROGRAMS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND CONSERVATION GROUPS FOR PROJECTS. THAT REDUCE FUELS FOR WILDFIRE REFORESTED DAMAGE ECOSYSTEMS AND PRESERVE VULNERABLE LAND. WE'RE JOINED THIS MORNING BY CHIEF PORTER AND THE CAL FIRE TEAM FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION ON THIS PROPOSAL. ANOTHER KEY PILLAR OF OUR NATURAL WORKING LANDS EFFORTS IS OUR CLIMATE SMART AGRICULTURE PROGRAMS THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES INVESTMENT OF TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION. TO SUPPORT THEY ARE CALIFORNIA'S AGRICULTURE INDUSTRY TOWARDS CLIMATE SMART I. AS PART OF THAT PACKAGE THE BUDGET INCLUDES THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR CDFA IS HEALTHY SOILS PROGRAM TO PROVIDE GRANTS FOR ON FARM SOIL MANAGEMENT PRACTICES I THANK SECRETARY ROSS WHO IS ALSO WITH US THIS MORNING FOR HER LEADERSHIP ON THIS CRITICAL PROGRAM. I SECRETARY BLUMENFELD EXPRESSED EARLIER WE ARE EAGER TO WORK WITH OUR NEW FEDERAL PARTNERS ON OUR COLLECTIVE CLIMATE AND EQUITY AGENDA. IF I DIDN'T HARRIS ADMINISTRATION HAS RECENTLY PROPOSED JUSTICE FORTY AN INITIATIVE TO SPEND 40% OF INVESTMENTS IN DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES TO ADVANCE ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE. THIS INITIATIVE BUILDS ON YOUR LEGISLATIVE LEADERSHIP AND DIRECTION TO PRIORITIZE OUR INVESTMENTS IN DISADVANTAGED IN LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES. THANKS FOR YOUR ONGOING SUPPORT IN OUR TIRELESS EFFORTS ON ADMINISTRATION WIDE CLIMB pINVESTMENT PROGRAMS WE HAVE LESSONS AND STRATEGIES TO SHARE WITH OUR NEW PARTNERS. WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUED PARTNERSHIP WITH ALL OF YOU AND COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE TO ADVANCE PARTIES OF CLIMATE EQUITY PROTECTING PUBLIC HEALTH AND DRIVING A GREEN ECONOMIC RECOVERY. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME TODAY SECRETARY BLUMENFELD AND I ARE HERE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. PERFECT OF MISTER BROWN WITH THE L. A. L. WILL GO TO YOU- NEXT COULD YOU INCLUDING YOUR COMMENTS YEAH WE'VE WE'VE WE JUST HAD A- SESSION ON THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM AND WE KNOW THAT. AB SIX ONE SEVEN IS A POLLUTION CONTROL PROBLEMS ARE PROGRAM VERSUS A DECARBONISATION OR DEEP DECARBONIZATION PROBLEMS AND THERE'S TRADE OFFS WITH TAKING MONEY THAT COULD BE USED FOR. DECARBONISING AND GIVING IT TO. EQUITY PROGRAMS ARE NOW CALL VERSUS- CRITERIA POLLUTANT PROBLEMS IN AND THE TRADEOFF THAT WE HAVE WITH THAT. AND THEN THE SECOND PART PREFERRED LIKE YOU. TALK TO WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE CLEAN TRUCK THE H. FIT IS OVERSUBSCRIBED WE KNOW THAT THE AGRICULTURAL DIESEL ENGINE PROGRAM IS OVER SUBSCRIBED BUT THE- CLEAN CARS FOR ALL OUR INTEREST IN THE THAT THAT'S UNDER ITS SUBSCRIBER. THE CVR PETE HAD BEEN OVER SUBSCRIBED SO WE'VE GOT MONEY. HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION GOING AT TEN UNDER SUBSCRIBER PROGRAM IF YOU COULD TOUCH ON THAT AND WE'LL GET FOR HER FROM. THE AGENCY ALSO. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- YEAH SO I WILL TRY TO KIND OF TOUCH ON THOSE SPECIFIC QUESTIONS AS I CAN I MAKE MY WAY THROUGH OUR COMMENTS ON THE PROPOSED AT CALTRAIN EXPENDITURE PLAN I DO WANT TO NOTE- WE HAVE- ANALYSIS OF THE PLAN UP AVAILABLE ON OUR WEBSITE AT L. A. O. DOT CA DOT GOV- A LOT OF THAT ANALYSIS IS ALSO INCLUDED IN YOUR GENDER TODAY AND SO I'M JUST GONNA TRY TO. SUMMARIZE SOME OF THE KEY POINTS FROM THAT- I KNOW THERE'S KIND OF A LOT OF NUMBERS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PACKAGING KIND OF DIFFERENT AMOUNTS- I DO WANT TO KIND OF HIGHLIGHT THAT THERE. AGAIN THAT THERE IS BOTH THE CURRENT YEAR COMPONENT TO THIS PACKAGE AS WELL AS A BUDGET YOU'RE A COMPONENT ABOUT SIX HUNDRED TWENTY FOUR MILLION- DISCRETIONARY FUNDING IN THE CURRENT YEAR AND SEVEN HUNDRED FORTY FIVE. MILLION DISCRETIONARY FUNDING IN THE BUDGET YEAR- I THINK IT IS- AS IT IS KIND OF BEEN HIGHLIGHTED ALREADY- IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT THAT THIS THE DISCRETIONARY PACKAGES QUITE A BIT LESS THAN IT HAS BEEN IN PRIOR YEARS AND THAT'S FOR A COUPLE DIFFERENT REASONS. ONE JUST LOWER REVENUE LOWER EXPECTED REVENUE COMING AND RELATIVE TO A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO. AND THEN SPECIFICALLY WHEN IT COMES TO THE DISCRETIONARY PACKAGE AND I THINK THIS IS WHAT- SENATOR AYE MCGUIRE WAS ALLUDING TO. THERE IS A PORTION OF FUNDING WHICH IS SORT OF MOVED INTO THE CONTINUOUS OF CORPORATIONS- CONTINUES APPROPRIATIONS NOW SIXTY FIVE PERCENT. OF THE ANNUAL REVENUE ANOTHER SIGNAL FOR OF WHAT DRINKING WATER AS PART OF THAT SO THAT JUST KIND OF FURTHER REDUCES THE- AMOUNT OF MONEY AVAILABLE IN THE DISCRETIONARY- PORTION OF FUNDING- AND I WON'T GO THROUGH ALL THAT ALL THE DIFFERENT- THE SANCHEZ- TOUCHED ON KIND OF A LOT OF THE DIFFERENT PROGRAMS- I WON'T GO THROUGH THOSE. AGAIN JUST TO MAYBE HIGHLIGHT YOU KNOW THAT THE PROPOSED FUNDING WOULD WOULD REALLY GOING TO PROGRAMS THAT HAVE IN THE PAST COMMONLY RECEIVE G. G. R. S. BUT THERE ARE SOME PROGRAMS LIKE CRP WHICH WAS MENTIONED THAT ARE NOT INCLUDED AND PRIORITISED IN THIS PACKAGE. SO I THINK OUR OUR HE COMMENTS ON THE PACKAGE OVERALL AT A HIGH LEVEL ARE. ONE WE DO THINK THE REVENUE ESTIMATES OF THE MINISTRY ATION IS ASSUMING. REGION AND REASONABLE- FOR NOW- BUT OF COURSE TO HIGHLIGHT THAT THERE IS A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY AS YOU KNOW AROUND CAP AND TRADE REVENUE IN A LOT OF. VOLATILITY IN THE REVENUE SOURCE THAT'S IMPORTANT TO KEEP IN MIND IF YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT YOUR- OVERALL PACKAGE. THE SECOND POINT IS- WITH THE CURRENT REVENUE ESTIMATES ON THE PROPOSED EXPENDITURES- THE ESTIMATED FUND BALANCE AT THE END OF BOTH THE CURRENT YEAR IN THE BUDGET YEAR- IN OUR VIEW IS. STILL RATHER IS RELATIVELY SMALL- ROUGHLY A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS AT THE END OF BUDGET YOU'RE WITH HIS PROPOSED PACKAGE. AND SO WE DO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO KEEP IN MIND GIVEN THE VOLATILITY OF THE REVENUE. SOURCE THAT IT'S A RELATIVELY SMALL FUND BALANCE SO KEEP THAT IN MIND WHEN KIND OF THINKING ABOUT THE OVERALL AMOUNT OF FUNDING THAT YOU'RE- I'M GOING TO BE ALLOCATING. IN BOTH THE CURRENT YEAR BUDGET YEAR. AND FINALLY ON THE- JUST ON THE EARLY ACTION COMPONENTS- WE THINK THAT CERTAIN COMPONENTS OF THE PACKAGE ARE MORE JUSTIFIED FOR EARLY ACTION THAN OTHERS- IN GENERAL THERE ARE JUST. NO TRADE OFFS WHEN YOU WERE SPEAKING ABOUT EARLY ACTION- PACKAGE- YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO GET THE MONEY OUT THE DOOR A FEW MONTHS EARLIER BY ADOPTING. SOME CURRENT YEAR FUNDING BUT THAT- ALSO SORT OF LIMITS TO KEEP TRADE OFF IS THAT NOT NOT WHEN THAT SORT OF THE LEGISLATURE'S ABILITY TO. DELIBERATE OVER- THOSE PROPOSED EXPENDITURES AND SO IT- WE THINK THERE NEEDS TO BE A STRONG JUSTIFICATION FOR EARLY ACTION AND- I'M CERTAIN PROGRAMS WHICH YOU LIKE- HAVE. A STRONGER JUSTIFICATION AND OTHERS AND I THINK IN PARTICULAR THE- A WILDFIRE FUNDING AND SB NINE OH ONE FUNDING THIS POST CONSISTENT WITH- STATUTORY. GUIDANCE IN SB NINE OH ONE AND WE ALSO THINK THERE'S- THE ADMINISTRATION HAS MADE A CASE THAT'S- AND BY PROVIDING OUTSTANDING EARLY- SOME OF THOSE FIRE REDUCTION- PROJECTS- OR FOREST HEALTH PROJECTS COULD BE IMPLEMENTED. ARE PRIOR TO THE TWENTY TWENTY TWO A FIRE SEASON SO THERE'S- IF. THERE'S ANY OF THOSE THAT ARE A REASON TO. ACTUALLY. INCLUDE THAT AS EARLY ACTION. THERE ARE RECOMMENDED. ARE FIRST- I CONSIDERED. THE EARLY OUT PACKED TO AND LESS THAN DIMINISH. IS AND- THAT WOULD YOU KNOW THAT THE LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER YOU KNOW INSTEAD SORT OF PROVIDING A LOT OF THAT FUNDING AS PART OF ITS OVERALL. BUDGET YEAR PACKAGE- WITH THE- EXCEPTION OF- YOU KNOW WHAT. AN ALTERNATE WOULD REALLY JUST BE TO FOCUS ON THE WILDFIRE PIECE OF THE EARLY ACTION PACKAGE AND THEN. THE LASER OF THE ALLOCATIONS FOR SOME OF THE OTHER ITEMS- AND SO- UNTIL YOU YOU DECIDE ON YOUR- BUDGET YOUR PACKAGE. ANOTHER OPTION IS THE LEGISLATURE DOES IDENTIFY SOME REALLY HIGH PRIORITY PROGRAM SORT OF LIKE TO GET THE MONEY OUT THE DOOR A FEW MONTHS EARLIER- LOOKING AT JUST HOW MUCH MONEY ESSENTIALLY. WE ALREADY HAVE IN THE BANK FOR DDR ASK GIVEN THE REVENUE UNCERTAINTY- EVEN OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF OPTIONS WE THINK KIND OF FOCUSING ON. WHAT WE KNOW- WE HAVE AVAILABLE IN TERMS OF RESOURCES AND- BY OUR CALCULATIONS THAT'S RIGHT NOW IT AT ABOUT THREE HUNDRED MILLION SO MAYBE SORT OF LIMITING THE AMOUNT OF SPENDING IN THE CURRENT YEAR TO. THAT AMOUNT- IS IT IS A GOOD PLACE TO START. AND THEN OF COURSE YOU'LL NEED TO KIND OF. WANT TO SORT OF REASSESS YOUR RESOURCES THAT ARE AVAILABLE AFTER WE HAVE THE RESULTS FOR THE NEXT COUPLE OPTIONS AS YOU CONSIDER YOUR- YOUR BUDGET YEAR PACKAGE. OF ONE KIND OF LONGER TERM ISSUE WAITED WHILE HIGHLIGHTED IS- THINKING ABOUT I MENTIONED THE FUND BALANCE IN THE RELATIVELY LOW FUND BALANCE- UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL IS. ROUGHLY 5% OF KIND OF IN YOUR ESTIMATED ANNUAL REVENUE. WOULD YOU THINK THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT WANT TO THINK ABOUT KIND OF. IN THE LONG TERM IN PARTICULAR IN THE BUDGET YEAR AND GOING FORWARD. THINKING ABOUT TRYING TO BUILD UP THE RESERVE FUND THAT'S FINE GIVEN THE REVENUE VOLATILITY. THAT COULD KIND OF HELP YOU KNOW HELP ENSURE LONG TERM FUND SOLVENCY AS WELL AS MAYBE A LITTLE BIT MORE. FUNDING PROJECT ABILITY FOR THE PROGRAMS GOING FORWARD IF THERE'S A LARGE RESERVE FUND THAT COULD KIND OF WHETHER SOME OF THE- SOME OF THAT- ACTUATION. RENDON OVERTIME. AND FINALLY- YOU KNOW WHEN IT COMES TO ALLOCATE FUNDS. TO PRO- YOU KNOW THAT'S A THINK A OF BUSINESS. REALLY DEPEND ON KIND OF WHAT YOUR PRIORITIES ARE AND HOW THEY ARE THEY MIGHT BE DIFFERENT FROM THE ADMINISTRATION'S PRIORITIES- MR AT. YEAH SURE MENTIONS SB SIX SEVENTEEN AND PARTICULAR I THINK THAT'S KIND OF A- YOU KNOW ONE GOOD EXAMPLE OF YOU KNOW THAT PROGRAM IS REALLY FOCUSED ON LOCAL AIR POLLUTION REDUCTIONS- AND YOU KNOW. ULTIMATELY KIND OF YOU KNOW HOW YOU PRIORITIZE THAT PROGRAM COMPARED TO OTHER PROGRAMS THAT FOCUS MORE ON. GREENHOUSE GASES OR FORCED HELL OR SATAN AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER REALLY SORT OF COMES DOWN TO WHAT YUR PRIORITIES ARE. IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW. LOCAL AIR POLLUTION REDUCTIONS CLIMATE CHANGE- ACTIONS OTHER TYPES OF BENEFITS RELATED. TO FORESTRY IN WILDFIRE AND THOSE TYPES OF THINGS- AND ONCE YOU HAVE. ONE OF THOSE RARITIES. AREN'T RUNNING AROUND- I THINK LAST. I KNOW YOU MENTIONED MR CHER WAS ON THE- DIFFERENCE TRANSPORTATION RELATED PROGRAMS AND THE MAN FOR THOSE PROGRAMS AYE YOU'RE RIGHT H. H. THAT WAS OVERSUBSCRIBED ALONG. A LONG TIME AGO- AND- ARE UNDERSTANDING IS THAT C. B. R. P. DOES HAVE SOME MONEY AVAILABLE STILL TO PROVIDE FUNDS FOR I THINK THE ESTIMATES ARE FOR OVER THE NEXT FEW MONTHS THERE ARE STILL SOME FUNDING AVAILABLE- PROGRAMS THAT PROVIDES MORE REBATES- BUT I THINK THINKING ABOUT- CERTAINLY KIND OF WHAT THE DEMAND IS FOR THE PROGRAMS AND PARTICULARLY FOR THOSE PROGRAMS THAT AND- HISTORICALLY BEEN OVERSUBSCRIBED THINKING ABOUT THAT AND TAKING THAT INTO ACCOUNT AS ONE OF THAT KIND OF KEY FACTORS THAT YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT. PRIORITIZING YOUR LIMITED RESOURCES THAT YOU HAVE MISTER CHARLES. AND THE FINAL IT SO I JUST DID WANT TO CUT TOUCH ON. THE ISSUE. THE REASON AND IS RETURNING FOR. IT'S JUST A GENERAL MATTER. WE DO THINK THAT IT IS IMPORTANT TO THE LEGISLATURE TO BE THINKING ABOUT BOTH OF THOSE PIECES TOGETHER- ANSWER GOING TO CONTINUALLY ASSESS YOU KNOW WHETHER THE CURRENT MIX OF PROGRAMS THAT ARE FUNDED BOTH IN THE CONTINUOUS PREPARATIONS AND DISCRETIONARY. ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE LEGISLATURE'S PRIORITIES AND SO- YOU KNOW THINKING ABOUT THOSE TWO PIECES TOGETHER I KNOW WE OFTEN FOCUS ON THE DISCRETIONARY HE'S THINKING ABOUT- BOTH DISCRETIONARY CONTINUOUS WE THINK THIS WOULD WORK TO ENSURE THE MONEY IS GOING TO HIS LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES SO APOLOGIES IF I WENT A LITTLE BIT LONGER BUT- HAPPY TO ANSWER. I'M GOING TO KEEP A LITTLE BIT LONGER UNIQUE SITUATION WE HAVE ONE TIME MONEY YOU KNOW YOU CAN'T PICK UP THE NEWSPAPER AND HEAR ABOUT WE'VE GOT EXCESS MONEY IN THE BUDGET MAYBE MORE EXCESS MONEY AND IT'S NOT LOST ON ANYBODY ON THIS PANEL THAT RESOURCES IS ALWAYS GET LEFT BEHIND WHEN IT COMES TO THESE ONE TIME MONEY THEY'RE THEY'RE WE'RE NOT HAVING FUN SPENT SO MY QUESTION TO YOU IS THAT. YOU KNOW ONE ON GOOD AS SENATOR MCGUIRE PUT UP THE ONE TIME FOR ONE YEAR FUNDING FOR THE HEALTHY FORESTS OR EVEN THE CLEAN TRUCK PROGRAMS DIEM DON'T YOU THINK THAT THOSE ARE COULD BE GIVEN THE IMPACT THAT THEY WOULD HAVE. REASONABLE EXPENDITURES FOR GENERAL FUND ONE TIME MONEY WITH THE EXCESS OF FUNDS TO COME UP AND THE EXPENDITURE PLAN. FOR CAP AND TRADE CAN ADDRESS SOME OF THESE OTHER LONG TERM PLANS WE HAVE I MEAN NOT THAT TO GIVE UP ON IT BUT THAT VALANCE THAT WE SAY THERE'S MONEY HERE USES ONE TIME MONEY TO JUMP STARTED THE TRUCK PROGRAM AND JUMPSTART THE- THE FORESTS IN A PRESCRIBED BURN SIDE. THE VEGETATION WHAT SAY YOU MISTER BROWN YEAH I MEAN I THINK IT'S COMPLETELY REASONABLE TO BE LOOKING AT YOU KNOW NOT JUST THE G. R. S. BUT ALSO OTHER FUND SOURCES AVAILABLE TO THE LEGISLATURE- WHEN THINKING. ABOUT YOU KNOW I FUNDING ON A PROGRAMS OR ANY PRO REALLY- SO I THINK- YEAH ACROSS OUR OF NUGENT FUND FOR A- THAT'S A IT'S A REASONABLE THING TO LOOK OUT I THINK. YOU'RE THE ONLY- PERHAPS SORT OF OBVIOUS THING TO POINT OUT IS YOU KNOW TO THE EXTENT WHERE USING GENERAL FUNDS THOSE ONE TIME GENERAL FUND RESOURCES FOR THESE ACTIVITIES IS NOT AVAILABLE FOR- ANY OF THE OTHERS- LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES AND KIND OF OTHER THINGS THAT COULD BE FUNDED BUT- ANSWERED EXTENTS. THESE PROGRAMS ARE- HIGH PRIORITY FOR THE USE OF THOSE ONE TIME FUNDS THAT'S THAT'S CERTAINLY SOMETHING THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD CONSIDER- AND CONSIDERED IN THE CONTEXT OF BOTH THE GDR OF PACKAGES WELL AS I KNOW THEY- EIGHTY EIGHT EXTENSION WAS MENTIONED BUT JUST SORT OF THE BROADER SUITE. OF ON THE POLICIES AND FUNDING SOURCES AS IT'S TRYING TO PIECE TOGETHER ITS PACKAGE AND- THE FUNDING OF PROVIDES FOR- IT'S GOING TO PROGRAMS. THANK YOU AND ONE OTHER THING YOU HAVE INSTRUCTED THEIR FEISTY THIS COMMITTEE AND THAT THE- SENATE IN GENERAL ABOUT. TARGETING SOME MARKET FAILURES IN THE IN THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAMS TO LOOK AT. PILOT PROGRAMS AND DEMONSTRATION PROGRAMS THAT WE CAN PUT IN THAT SCIENCE ESEARCH THAT WERE THAT THE PRIVATE SECTOR IS NOT GOING. TO TAKE CARE OF THEY'RE THEY'RE NOT GOING TO. THE THEY'RE NOT GOING TO DO THIS PROPOSAL HAS NONE OF THAT YET- HOW CAN YOU GIVE US SOME CONTEXT OF WHAT WHAT THE IMPORTANCE IS TO MAKING THESE INVESTMENTS IN THESE PILOT PROGRAMS. SO THAT WE THAT NEXT GENERATION OF TECHNOLOGIES DONE THAT THE PRIVATE SECTOR IS NOT. COULD HAVE ALWAYS INVESTED THEM. YES I THINK OUR COMMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS AROUND THIS ITEM AS YOU MENTIONED ARE KIND OF. REALLY AND THE VAN OF YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT IS THE- THE MOST APPROPRIATE ROLE FOR GOVERNMENTS AND KIND OF SOME OF THESE CHANGES AND AN EMISSION REDUCTION ACTIVITIES SENDS. WE TALKED A LOT ABOUT CAP AND TRADE IN CARBON PRICING TO SORT OF TRY TO ADDRESS YOU KNOW SOME OF THAT THE EXTERNALITIES ESSENTIALLY ASSOCIATED WITH- WITH CARBON EMISSIONS BUT- THAT DOESN'T. NECESSARILY GET YOU ALL THE WAY THERE AND THERE ARE I THINK SORT OF STRONG. RATIONALES FOR SOME GOVERNMENT SUPPORT FOR- RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES- PILOTS AND DEMONSTRATIONS FOR. EARLY STAGE TECHNOLOGIES TO. THE YOU KNOW PROVIDE MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE DEGREE TO WHICH THOSE TECHNOLOGIES WORK AND KIND OF HELP THAT. THE MARKET FOR THOSE TYPES OF. ACTIVITIES AND SO WE DO THINK THAT'S A REASONABLE PLACE TO THINK ABOUT IF YOU CAN'T HAVE LIMITED FUNDS. HOW TO SORT OF FILL GAPS OR KIND OF YOU KNOW HOW TO- FUND ACTIVITIES WHERE THERE'S A STRONG SORT OF RATIONALE FOR SOME SORT OF GOVERNMENT. OUR GOVERNMENT SUPPORT FOR THOSE FOR THOSE PROGRAMS- IT IT IT I UNDERSTAND THAT SOME OF THE HEAVY DUTY VEHICLE FUNDING COULD GO TO. SOME PILOT AND DEMONSTRATION ACTIVITIES BUT YOU'RE RIGHT FOR THEM- AND THERE MIGHT BE I THINK- EVEN IN THE AGRICULTURAL AREA OTHERS I THINK. POTENTIAL FOR SOME- PILOTS AND DEMONSTRATIONS BUT- OVERALL A LOT OF THE MONEY I THINK IT'S GOING TO KIND OF. MORE DEPLOYMENT- INCENTIVES ON A LOT OF CASES AND SO THAT'S JUST THAT'S ONE KIND OF IMPORTANT THING THE LEGISLATURE THINK LAUGHTER. AFTER WAY AND A PARTLY GETS BACK AT SORT OF THE SOME OF THE DISCUSSION WE HAD AROUND SORT OF NEAR TERM VERSUS. LONG TERM GOALS THOSE THOSE PILOTS AND DEMONSTRATIONS AND SUPPORT FOR THOSE- KIND OF EARLY STAGE TECHNOLOGIES AND TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCEMENTS- HAVE MORE OF A KIND OF LONG TERM FOCUS WEARING IT I THINK THE HOPE IS THAT OVER TIME SOME OF THOSE TECHNOLOGIES WILL BE- THE COSTS WILL COME DOWN IN THAT THEY- THEY WILL BE pTHE OF THE LONGER TERM GOALS. BUT THAT'S SORT OF THAT I THINK THE TENSION THAT YOU YOUR FACE AND OF HOW TO. AND TRYING TO OF FIGURE OUT HOW TO. ALLOCATE YOUR FUNDS ACROSS DIFFERENT PROGRAMS IS PARTLY THAT THAT SORT OF SHORT TERM VERSUS LONG TERM FOCUS. AND THERE'S WHERE THE FUN BEGINS- ALL RIGHT. LET'S MOVE THE FINANCER YOU GET A LITTLE FLAVOR AND WITH. WHAT THE- CHAIRS THINKING ABOUT WHAT DO YOU HAVE ON THIS EXPENDITURE PROGRAM AND THE- AND THE- POINTS HAVE BEEN RAISED SO FAR. HI YES THANK YOU. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND WE DON'T HAVE ANYTHING ADDITIONAL TO ADD AT THIS TIME BUT ARE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY SPECIFIC QUESTIONS. YOU MIGHT HAVE. WE'RE LIMITED WITH TIME THANK YOU VERY MUCH LET'S GO TO A- DIRECTOR PORTER WITH CAL FIRE- AND ANGELA LOTS NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN THIS WEEK YOU HAVE A- THE ITEMS ON THE- THE NATURAL WORKING LANDS. GOOD MORNING. GOOD MORNING SHARE AND ECONOMIC CAMERA WORKING THIS THIS MORNING- AND MEMBERS ALSO THANK YOU SECRETARY BLUMENFELD AND EPA FOR PARTNERSHIP ON THIS TOPIC. AGAIN MY NAME IS TOM PORTER CAL FIGHTER- DIRECTOR AND STATE FORESTER- CAL FIRES FORCED HEALTH AND PREVENTION PROGRAMS INVEST GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUNDS. IN PROJECTS ACROSS CALIFORNIA AND THESE PROJECTS- REDUCE UNCONTROLLED WILDFIRE EMISSIONS AND INCREASE. CARBON ABSORPTION- WHICH DOES IN THOSE HEALTHY FORESTS THAT WE PRODUCE. ENCHILADAS HIS ASSISTANT DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF ENERGY CLIMATE AND ENERGY FOR CAL FIRE AND SHE WILL- FINISH THIS OPENING. THE MORNING EVERYONE I THINK YOU DIRECTOR PORTER GOOD MORNING SENATORS I THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK- AS EARLIER STATED THE CALVET COMPONENT OF THIS FUNDING CONTINUES- AT THE GOVERNOR COMPONENT OF THIS PROPOSAL CONTINUES AT THE FUNDING THAT WAS ESTABLISHED BY YOU ALL AND SB NINE A ONE. THE FOREST HEALTH AND FIRE PREVENTION OF PROGRAMS WHICH ARE ADMINISTERED BY RESOURCE MANAGEMENT IN THE OFFICE OF THE STATE FIRE MARSHAL HERE AT CAL FIRE AND- FUNDING FOR THE CALIFORNIA FUELS CREWS- WHICH- HELP US ACHIEVE THIS FUELS REDUCTION REFORESTATION AND OTHER LAND MANAGEMENT WORK. WE ARE EXCITED TO GET GOING WITH OUR PROGRAMMING FOR THIS YEAR HAS BEEN ON HOLD OF COURSE SINCE THIS PAST SUMMER AND FALL OUTWE HAVE PARTNERS ARE READY AND WAITING TO GET THE FUNDS INTO ON THE GROUND PROJECTS AND WE'D ALSO LIKE TO GET THEM GOING THAT WE CAN BE READY FOR THE NEXT ROUND OF FUNDING COMING UP NEXT YEAR. SO I APPRECIATE YOUR CONSIDERATION OF OUR FUNDING FOR THIS YEAR AND ALSO JUST LIKE TO DRAW YOUR ATTENTION TO THE EXTENSION OF THIS FUNDING BOUGHT THE TWO HUNDRED MILLION- WHICH WAS SET TO EXPIRE IN TWO OF HIS CLEAR TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR AT THE EXTENSION WHICH IS NOW CONTINUES THAT BLOCK THROUGH TWENTY THIRTY. THE END OF THE CURRENT AND OF THE COVENTRY PROGRAMMING- IT JUST BRINGS GREAT STABILITY TO OUR PROGRAMMING AND ALSO TO OUR PARTNERS AND HOW WE CAN CONDUCT OUR OPERATIONS FROM YEAR TO YEAR SIR REALLY GRATEFUL FOR THAT'S PROPOSAL AND FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION. OF THAT. THANK YOU SO MUCH. THE YOU ALL ALL COUPLE BACK IN A SECOND LET I REALIZE I'M TRYING TO MANAGE THE TIME HERE. LET'S MOVE TO- SECRETARY ROSS- AT THE MORNING STAFF AND MEMBERS RIGHT THREE H. AS YOU KNOW YOU'VE BEEN FOLLOWING THE WORKING LANDS IN THE HEALTHY SOILS AND THIS THIS SUBCOMMITTEE HAS. USES THE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR FIGURE VERSUS THE FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLAR FIGURE FOR EARLY ACTION AND I'M AND I KNOW YOU SPEAK FOR THE MINISTRY HERE THANKFUL FOR THE FIFTEEN MILLION- BUT JUST SO THE PUBLIC KNOWS IS WHAT WHAT WE HEAR THIS COMMITTEE ARE TALKING IN THE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN HALF FOR THE LAST. THREE YEARS SO. PLEASE GO AHEAD PRESENT. SURE I'M JUST VERY BRIEFLY I DID WANT TO TOUCH ON A COUPLE OF POINTS AROUND THE HEALTHY SOILS PROGRAM- WE ARE CURRENTLY OVER SUBSCRIBED BY 2100% WHICH IS A GOOD THING. I THINK THAT'S BECAUSE OF THE FORMULA THAT WE USE TO FUND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND MAKING SURE THAT THE SMALLEST FARMERS ARE SOCIALLY DISADVANTAGED FARMERS. AND FARMERS AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES KNOW ABOUT OUR PROGRAMS AND HAVE THAT TECHNICAL SUPPORT FROM FIVE FOUR PROGRAMS. IT'S ALSO BEEN PROVIDED THE INCENTIVE GRANTS. AS WELL AS FOR THE DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS. WE NEED TO SCALE UP ALL OF THESE HEALTHY CELLS PRACTICES. IN THE STATE IS LARGEST CALIFORNIA WITH THE DIVERSITY OF AGRICULTURE THAT WE HAVE. BUT THERE IS THE CROP PATTERNS. OR THE MICRO CLIMATES IN WHICH PEOPLE ARE FARMING OR THE SIZE OF THEIR FARMS THESE DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS I THINK HAVE REALLY HELPED US. CREATE A PLATFORM FOR MORE FARMERS TO SEE WHAT'S POSSIBLE AND TO ADOPT THOSE PRACTICES THEMSELVES. A NUMBER OF THOSE DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS HAVE ALSO COLLECTED DATA SO THAT WE CAN PROVIDE REAL TIME INFORMATION TO FARMERS ABOUT WITH THE ECONOMICS ARE WHAT THE TRADE OFFS ARE WITH THE DECISION MAKING PROCESS YEAH. I'M TO DATE. WE HAVE FUNDED APPROXIMATELY FORTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS IN GRANTS TO A TOTAL OF SIX HUNDRED AND FORTY SIX PROJECTS THAT'S A COMBINATION OF FIVE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY INDIVIDUAL FARMER INCENTIVE GRANTS. AS WELL AS SIXTY SIX DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS. THAT COVER OVER FIFTY SIX THOUSAND ACRES. S. A. KUESTER CO TWO EQUIVALENT OF A HUNDRED AND TEN THOUSAND METRIC TONS- AS WE HAVE EVOLVED THIS PROGRAM IN A FAIRLY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. WE MAKE SURE THAT IT'S ALIGNED WITH THE USDA NATURAL RESOURCES CONSERVATION. SERVICE THE STANDARD PRACTICES. SO IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S FAMILIAR. AND AS EVIDENCE BASED SCIENCE BASED PRACTICES. AND WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO INCLUDE ADDITIONAL PRACTICES AS TO GET THE DATA TO DO SO. THE MOST RECENT ONE HAS BEEN THIS PAST YEAR THE INCLUSION. OF WHOLE ORCHARD RECYCLING. FOR THOSE FOR- NEED TO BE TAKEN OUT. AUTOMATICALLY IF A WAY OF COME IN AND PULLING OUT THE WHOLE TREE MULCHING AT AND THEN IMMEDIATELY INCORPORATING THAT INTO THE SOIL TO SEQUESTER CARBON. HUGE POTENTIAL TO GROW THAT PROGRAM ESPECIALLY AS WE DEAL WITH POTENTIAL PHASE OUT IN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME AFTERBURNING. THE OTHER ONE I WANTED TO TOUCH ON AMONGST THE MANY HEALTH BENEFITS WE GET FROM HEALTHY SOILS. IS A POLLINATOR HABITAT WE HAVE SINCE THE ESTABLISHMENT OF OUR HEALTHY SOILS PROGRAM GIVEN EXTRA POINTS TO THOSE PROJECTS FOR HEDGE ROWS IN COVER CROPS. THAT ARE VERY FRIENDLY FOR BEES MONARCH BUTTERFLIES AND OTHER POLLINATORS. OF AND WITH THAT I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU HAVE. I WOULD POINT THAT. OTHERS INCLUDED IN EARLY ACTION ALLOWS US TO KEEP THE MOMENTUM THAT WE HAVE GOING. AND REALLY HELPS OUR FARMERS IN PLANNING THE SOONER THEY KNOW THAT DOLLARS MAY BE AVAILABLE IT WILL HELP THEM IN SOME OF THEIR PLAN TO DECISIONS GOING FORWARD. YEAH THANK YOU I NOTICED THAT YOU KNOW IN THE SMART AGRICULTURE VERSUS THE DIMERIC OR CULTURAL. CLIMATE PROGRAMS WE HAVE HISTORICALLY WE'VE GIVEN MONEY FOR METHANE REDUCTION HISTORICALLY YOU FOR PUT THE ENERGY DEPARTMENT ON INCENTIVES FOR FOOD PROCESSORS AND YOU'VE ALSO WORKED WITH THE ENERGY DEPARTMENT. FOR AGRICULTURE RENEWABLE ENERGY THAT DAY YEAH THE MICROGRID TO NAY THAT THE ACT E. D. HOW ABOUT THE PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT. YOU GOT THERE'S NOTHING IN THAT BUDGET UNDER- FOR. SMART ACADEMICS CLIMATE SMART AGRICULTURE CAN YOU HELP US OUT. SURE I'M- A MUCH OF THAT TECHNOLOGY HAS NOW BEEN PROVEN AND SO IT IS LISTED AS WHAT WOULD QUALIFY UNDER THE CLIMATE. CATALYST FUND FOR CLIMATE SMART AGRICULTURE THE BUDGET PROPOSES FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS TO FIND EXACTLY THOSE KINDS OF TECHNOLOGIES. IS THE DIFFERENCE OF PROVING THAT CAN WORK AND PRACTICAL EVERYDAY SITUATIONS AND THEN HOW DO YOU SCALE THAT UP AND GO THROUGH THE COMMERCIALIZATION TO BROADEN MAP ANDSO- LOW INTEREST LOANS AND LOAN GUARANTEES CAN BE VERY HELPFUL. AND CONTINUING TO SCALE UP ITS TECHNOLOGIES. FOR THOSE THREE PROGRAMS HAD LIKE A HUNDRED AND SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS TWO YEARS AGO RIGHT SO ALL THAT'S GOING TO COMPETE WITH ALL THE OTHER- A PROGRAMS OKAY. HI IT JUST SEEMS LIKE NO ONE I TALK ABOUT DECARBONIZATION ONCE AGAIN IT ALL I'M NOT I'M NOT LEAVING THE BAND HERE WHAT THE DIFFERENT TACK GESTURES BUT THE MONEY THAT GOES IN THERE AND THE METHANE REDUCTION AND THE DEEP CARBONIZATION THAT IS. THAT IS TRANSFERABLE I MEAN IF THE TECHNOLOGY IS AS YOU SAY READY TO GO. THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE LIKE TO EXPORT TO THE ARGENTINES AND THE OTHER CATTLE PRODUCING PEOPLE ALL OVER THE WORLD THE SAKE HERE'S RENT SOME ENERGY OFF IT IS RUN SOME FUEL OFFER THIS IT SEEMS LIKE THAT'S A- KEY ROLE FOR CALIFORNIA WITH THE- AMOUNT OF. THE IMPORTANCE OF AGRICULTURE FOR WE THAT'S TO BE A LEADER IN THESE. AREAS ACKERMAN. IF IT'S READY TO GO IT'S READY TO GO IT JUST SEEMS LIKE ZERO MIGHT BE. IT MIGHT BE PREMATURE BUT WILL I'M SURE MY OTHER COLLEAGUES WILL HAVE A QUESTIONS. ON THAT. OKAY FROM ALL RIGHT THAT'S IT WE'RE AT WORK FOR THE QUESTION CENTER DAHLE EAGLE FIRST. THANK YOU TO SHARE SO I HAVE A QUESTION FOR SECRETARY AG- ARE YOU FAMILIAR WITH THE EQUIPO GRAHAM THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT- USES TO. INITIATE A PROJECT FOR. WATER EFFICIENCIES HEALTHY SOILS I JUST BECAUSE MY THOUGHT IS THAT YOU KNOW FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IS. LIKE YOU KNOW A DROP IN THE OCEAN IN CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURE AND I WAS THINKING ALONG THE LINES OF SOMEBODY WHO IS VERY- CONSCIOUS ABOUT MAKING SURE MY SOILS ARE OUR- HEALTHY AND- I'VE DONE A LOT OF WORK IN THE BIO CHAR AREA IN. THE LIKES AND YOU MENTIONED ABOUT USING- YOU KNOW. THREE CROSSES RESIDUE TO BUILD YOUR SOIL WHAT ABOUT DOING MAYBE- LIKE A 75% GRANT TO THE FARMER IN THE IN THE IN THE PHARMACY PUT IN 25% OR FIFTY WE GET MORE ACRES TREATED WE GET MARK- BANKS. FOR THE BUCK IN THE CARBON SIDE OF IT IN HEALTHY SOILS AS ARE MANY THOUGHT ABOUT THAT. YES THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION SENATOR AND I'M SORRY I DON'T HAVE THE NUMBERS AVAILABLE ON WHAT THE MATCH HAS BEEN FROM OUR FARMERS HISTORICALLY- WHETHER IT'S IN THE METHANE REDUCTIONS OR OTHERWISE. AND WE HAVE WORKED REALLY HARD TO ALIGN OUR PRACTICES WITH THE NRCS LIKE THE EQUIP PROGRAM. AND PART OF OUR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE GOAL% HAS BEEN THAT WERE OUT. PROVIDING INFORMATION ABOUT CLIMATE SMART AGRICULTURE AND HERE ARE THE PLACES WHERE YOU CAN APPLY FOR INCENTIVES. BUT THERE IS THE USDA QUICK PROGRAM. FOR OUR PROGRAM AND I THINK THAT WITH SOME OF THE PROPOSALS FROM THE FIGHTING ADMINISTRATION THAT HAVE ALREADY RECEIVED QUITE A BIT OF ATTENTION AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. THERE'S EVEN MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR US TO LEVERAGE THE DOLLARS THAT WE HAVE. AND USE THAT TO INCENTIVIZE MORE FARMERS BEING ABLE TO TAP INTO THOSE FEDERAL DOLLARS AND DROP THOSE DOWN AS WELL. THANK YOU THAT'S GOOD TO HEAR THAT WE'RE TRYING TO LEVERAGE. THE SMALL RESOURCES WE HAVE I HAVE ONE MORE QUESTION- FOR CHIEF OF PORTER- SILVA AS SOMEBODY WHO WORKED- DILIGENTLY ON SB NINE A ONE AND WHO'S ALSO BEEN I WAS A MEMBER THIS YOU'RE NOT A CONSERVANCY- FOR SEVEN YEARS BEFORE I CAME TO THE LEGISLATURE WE WORKED ON- WE'VE WE'VE KNOWN THE FIRE HIS. IS GONNA DO WHAT IT'S DOING. AND SO WITH THAT I KNOW THAT WITH THE BOTTOM MONIES SEEM TO BE DIRECTED- TO YOUR ORGANIZATION. AND I TOURED A COUPLE OF THE PROJECT- A BY THE COLFAX AREA- THAT- E. THE CALIFORNIA WAS DOING IN. THE COST PER ACRE WAS REALLY HIGH AND SO ONE OF THE TOOLS I THINK THAT WE'VE I THINK MISSED OUT ON AS ARE FIRE SAFE COUNCILS EVERY COUNTY HAS A FIRE SAFE COUNCIL. THEY ARE WORKING WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ARE WORKING WITH HOMEOWNERS AND LANDOWNERS AND TRYING TO BE ABLE TO MAYBE GET SOME OF THESE RESOURCES DOWN- TO THE FIRE SAFE COUNCILS TO ABLE TO GO OUT AND DO SOME OF THE WORK ALONG WITH- WHAT YOU'RE PROVIDING. A WHAT YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT AT THE THEIR DISTASTE THE PACE AND SCALE THAT WE NEED TO MOVE. A IN CALIFORNIA TO GET THESE MOVIES- TREATED- I THINK THAT EVEN THOUGH WE PUT OF THE RESOURCES IN THERE- THERE'S JUST NOT ENOUGH CONTRACTORS OUT THERE- TO DO THE WORK AND SO I WANTED TO KNOW WHAT YOUR THOUGHTS WERE ON THAT IS HOW WE COULD MOVE- THE RESOURCES AND GET MORE WORK DONE ON THE GROUND AT A LESSER. OF A COST. TO TREAT MORE ACRES. THANK YOU SENATOR DOLLY- GREAT QUESTION AGAIN TOM PORTER CAL FIRE DIRECTOR AND STATE FORESTER WEEKWHAT- WHAT I WOULD SAY TO THAT IS- THE FUNDING THAT HAS BEEN BUILT INTO OUR BUDGET OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS- ON THE BACK OF SB NINE ONE THANK YOU VERY MUCH- HAS ALLOWED US TO START THAT BUILDING OF THE- THE INDUSTRY TO PRODUCE THAT WORK- SO. THOUGH THE FOREST WORKERS AND THE TIME IN IN CALIFORNIA CAPABILITIES ARE INCREASING WE HAVE SEVERAL OTHER PROGRAMS THAT ARE OUTSIDE OF THE SPECIFIC FUNDING THAT ARE ARE LOOKING AT INCREASING THE- THE- TRAINING FOR SUCH WORKERS. BUT THE QUESTION OF GETTING MORE MONEY TO FIRE SAFE COUNCILS AND ARMED- THOSE THAT ARE REALLY THE COMMUNITY BASED- ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURES TO MANAGE SOME OF THESE PROJECTS WERE VERY MUCH ABOUT THAT- WE CAN CONTINUE TO REPORT BACK ON ON WHAT WE ARE DOING WITH THE FUNDS THAT WE HAVE CURRENTLY BUT A LOT OF THOSE FUNDS ARE GOING TO A NONPROFIT AS AS WELL AS- THOSE FIRE SAFE COUNCILS. AND OTHERS AND I DO KNOW THAT LIKE ALL OF THESE PROGRAMS WE ARE OVER- SUBSCRIBED WE HAVE MORE APPLICANTS THAN WE CAN FUND ARE CURRENTLY AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO OF WITH THESE ADDITIONAL FUNDS STARTING TO GETTING GET MORE OF THOSE FUNDS DOWN TO THOSE TYPES OF A PROJECT AREAS BOTH OF THE FOREST HEALTH AREA. BUT ALSO IN THE FIRE PREVENTION WHICH IS THAT- NEXT YEAR IN AND AROUND CLOSER TO COMMUNITIES BUT STILL HAS A VERY POSITIVE GREENHOUSE. GAS ONE OF THE TOUGHEST. SO I HAVE A ONE MORE ON KNOW WHO THIS WOULD ANSWER THIS- WHAT ONE OF THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES I BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE IN. CALIFORNIA IS THAT. YOU KNOW ALMOST 60% OF OUR LAND IS CONTROLLED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND- I BROUGHT THIS UP IN OUR LAST HEARING ABOUT THEM BEING A PARTNER IN. YOU KNOW DOING GOOD FORESTRY AND- YOU KNOW OVER THE LAST FOUR YEARS IT'S ALWAYS BEEN. WELL YOU KNOW THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION AND ALL ALL AGREE HE HE WHEN HE SAID CALIFORNIA'S FOREST FIRES ARE CALIFORNIA'S PROBLEMS NO. THERE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S PROBLEM BECAUSE 60% OF THAT LAND THEY MANAGE OR DON'T MANAGE IN MOST CASES IN AT LEAST IN MY OPINION. WHAT IS A NEXUS BETWEEN. THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FORESTRY AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S FOR SERVICE IN TRYING TO HOLISTICALLY TREAT. THE MOUNT OF WATERSHEDS THAT ARE IMPAIRED IN CALIFORNIA AND I SAY THAT AS SOMEBODY WHO WORKED. WITH SOMETHING WE CALL THE QUINCY LIBRARY GROUP WHICH WAS TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO WHERE WE WENT THROUGH AND WE SAID WE HAD A FEDERAL BILL TO DO LANDSCAPE TYPE. FUEL BREAKS SO WAS MUST MOSAIC FUEL BREAKS IN LASSEN- PLUMAS AND SIERRA. FOR THE PART OF THE TITLE FORCED TO TRY TO PUT IN THESE FUEL BREAKS WE WOULD HAVE A FIRE LARGER THAN EIGHT THOUSAND ACRES WE WOULD HAVE FUEL RACING OR SO. THAT'S WHAT NEED TO REALLY HAPPEN WE NEED TO GO THROUGH AND PUT FUEL BREAKS IN OUR FOR SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE THESE. HUGE FOREST FIRES THAT WE CAN CONTAIN OF DUMB BACK AND TREAT. IN BETWEEN THOSE FIREBRICK SO WHO WHO IS COORDINATING WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S WHAT I'M TRYING TO FIGURE I THINK WE REALLY MISSED THE BOAT IN CALIFORNIA. BECAUSE WE DON'T WE HAVE A PARTNER WHO'S NOT AT THE TABLE. SO I'M ASSUMING NOW THAT- WE HAVE AN ADMINISTRATION AND IN. DC THAT. TALK TO THE ADMINISTRATION IN CALIFORNIA AND THERE'S NOT THIS ADVERSARIAL. RELATIONSHIP THAT WE CAN NOW SIT DOWN AND FIGURE OUT HOW WE'RE GOING TO TREAT. TOGETHER THE FORCED. ALLEGEDLY THAT AFTER. LIKE YEAH LIKE CANCER THAT. AGAIN I WILL I WILL PROVIDE AN ANSWER- AND THANK YOU AGAIN SENATOR DOLLY FOR THAT QUESTION. THE HELLO AGAIN TOM BORDER CAL FIRE DIRECTOR AND STATE FORESTER WHERE WE ARE- WITH THE WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PARTICULARLY FOR SERVICE WILL JUST FOCUS ON THEM THEY'RE THE LARGEST SINGLE LANDOWNER OF THESE TYPES OF PLANS IN CALIFORNIA. AND OUR RELATIONSHIP AND OUR OUR- PLANNING PROCESS IS VERY GOOD AND ACTUALLY- AND THEN BE OF A LOT OF PARTS OF THE OF THE UNITED STATES- BECAUSE WE ARE SO CLOSE. WHERE WE'VE HAD A SHORTAGE IS- IN FEDERAL FUNDING TO FEDERAL PROJECTS AND THAT IS AN AREA THAT WE'RE WORKING VERY CLOSELY OF THROUGH THE PROPER CHANNELS- SECRETARY CROWFOOT OF NATURAL RESOURCES. IS ENGAGED WITH THE ADMINISTRATION AND CONVERSATIONS- AT THE- AT THE BINDING MINISTRATION LEVEL ON AND FOR SERVICE USDA ON. INCREASING THAT FUNDING AND- MAKING SURE THEY'RE MEETING THEIR MATCH- THAT WE HAVE BEEN PROVIDING WE PUT ABOUT HOUSEHOLDS ARE ARE FUNDS OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS INTO PROJECTS ON FEDERAL LANDS- THAT PROTECT OUR COMMUNITIES- AND SO WE ARE ACTIVELY THERE. WE ARE HAVING THOSE CONVERSATIONS AND- REGION FIVE FORESTER RANDY MOORE AND I TALK REGULARLY ABOUT- INCREASING THOSE EFFORTS THEY NEED MORE FUNDING DIRECTED TO THEIR PROGRAMS OF ALL TYPES AND- JUST TO BACKTRACK ON THE PREVIOUS QUESTION. OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS WE'VE FUNDED A FIFTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF PROJECTS TO NINETY ONE A SEPARATE FIRE SAFE. COUNCILS IN CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU. RIGHT I GUESS FOR FINANCE TO. ADD TO THE COVER UP BECAUSE WE DID WE HAVE GIVEN MONEY TO CAL- YES FOR- THE LOCAL FIRE RESPONSE IN AND THE RESOURCE THAT THE ADMINISTRATION NATURAL RESOURCE ADMINISTRATION AT THE REGIONAL FOR A LOCAL FIRE- FORCE RESTORATION PROJECTS- BUT THE CAL FIRE WITH THE CAL WILDLIFE URBAN INTERFACE AND OTHER FIRE PREVENTION ACTIVITIES. AND ALSO THE URBAN FORESTRY ALL THOSE PROGRAMS ARE ZEROED OUT OTHER DISCREPANCY PROGRAMS ARE ALL GIRLS ARE NOT MEAN WE ARE WE KNOW WE HAD A HEARING LAST WEEK AND PRESCRIBED FIRES SOME REDUCTIONS SO WE KNOW THAT MONEY'S BEING REPLACED WHETHER IT'S ENOUGH MONEY WE'RE GOING TO GET THAT'S NOT PART OF THIS PROGRAM BUT- I THINK. THE MOSAIC. THAT THE CENTER DOLLIES TALKING ABOUT THESE OTHER PARTNERS THAT WE HAVE AT LEAST UNDER THIS HEALTHY FOREST. PROPOSAL IS BEEN ZEROED OUT FINANCE CAN YOU SHED SOME LIGHT ON YOUR THINKING. CERTAINLY THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION I WOULD JUST LIKE TO PUT THIS IN THE CONTEXT OF NOTING THAT WE HAVE LESS FUNDING AVAILABLE AS THE LA US ANALYSIS. I WE'RE PROPOSING ABOUT ONE POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS OVER TWO YEARS THE CURRENT YEAR AND THE BUDGET YEAR WHICH IS ABOUT WHAT WAS ALLOCATED IN A SINGLE YEAR. IN TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY SO THEREFORE WE HAVE HAD TO PROPOSED EXPENDITURE PLAN THAT IS TARGETED AND LIMITED. AND PRIORITIZES FUNDING FOR EQUITY PROGRAMS LOW CARBON TRANSPORTATION THEIR MISSION VEHICLES AND NATURAL WORKING WITH THEM. SO HOW CAN TO PASS IT OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE STEVEN BENSON TO SEE IF HE HAS ANYTHING ADDITIONAL TIME. YES IT IS THE CHAIR HAS NOTED BEFORE. IT'S FINE AND DANDY THEY HAVE THESE EQUITY PROGRAMS BUT THEY'RE NOT DEEP CARBON REDUCTION PROGRAM SIR THERE THE- POLLUTION PROGRAMS WHICH IS FINE BUT THAT'S NOT. WHAT THE SOURCE OF MONEY SUPPOSED TO BE DOING FOR AT LEAST WHAT FOR THE AMOUNT OF. THE AMOUNT OF CHANGES GOING INTO WITH THE LIMITED MONEY THAT WE HAVE- STEVE. EUROPE IT IS VERY BRIEFLY- MENTIONED THAT SO IF I AM GOING BACK. TO THE EARLIER QUESTION A LITTLE BIT THAT. REPORTER ROCK ABOUT A LOT OF THE RELATIONSHIP GOING ON A FEDERAL GOVERNMENT JUST WITH YOUR BILL. ON THAT NOTE TO NOTE THAT- NATURISM IS AGENCY OUR COMPUTERS OFFICE ENTERED INTO A STRATEGIC AGREEMENT WITH THE FOR SERVICE THAT HELP TREAT- I THINK THEY'RE GONNA MATCH THE GOAL OF FIVE THOUSAND ACRES ANNUALLY AS WELL SO THERE ARE THEY JUST GONNA TO GO ALONG WITH THAT I'M GOING CONVERSATIONS AND WHAT GOING ON TO HELP BOLSTER THAT WORK THAT'S PART OF THE MOSAIC GIVEN HOW MUCH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT UNKNOWNS IN TERMS OF FORTUNATE LANCE. UNDER THE PROGRAMS YOU KNOW THAT THE WILDFIRE FORCED RESILIENCE EXPENDITURE PLAN THIS YEAR WE TALKED ABOUT LAST WEEK- FOCUSES A LOT OF MONEY. THE FAIR AMOUNT OF MONEY- IT TO CONTINUE FOR ADDITIONAL FIVE YEARS THE TO OUR MILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT THAT'S DIRECTED THROUGH SB NINE A ONE. WELL THAT FUNDING GOES THE FORCED HEALTH PROGRAM AS WELL AS- THE FUNDING THAT GOES TO HELP WITH YOUR SMALL LANDOWNERS- SO. IT THINK THEY'RE THERE ARE FFORTS THE VARIOUS PROGRAMS RUN THROUGH AL FIRE ENGINES ARE EXTENT YOU KNOW YES AS WELL THAT- ARE. AIMED AT TRYING TO HALT. WITH AND IF THINK IS. APTLY PUT THE MOSAIC OF KIND OF LAND OWNED ALL THOSE VERY DIFFERENT VARIOUS DIFFERENT TYPES OF LANDOWNERS TO HELP ADDRESS THE PROBLEM. AND I WILL I WILL GO INTO MORE DETAIL ON THAT GIVEN HOW MUCH DETAIL WE WENT IN LAST WEEKON THE ON THE WELFARE FORCED RESILIENCE PLAN. BUT YOU KNOW HAPPY TO ANSWER HIS QUESTIONS. HELP REVAMP. ALL RECOGNIZE CENTER STERN HAS SOME QUESTIONS AS YOU REMEMBER FROM LAST WEEK THEY'RE- THEY'RE MEMBERS OF THIS SUBCOMMITTEE THAT HAVE A MORE AMBITIOUS PLAN HIS ON THE HEALTHY. FORESTS AND THE FOREST PREVENTION- AS FAR AS NUMBERS AND THERE'S ALSO IS I'VE INTIMATED BEFORE THERE'S GENERAL FUNDS FOR NATURAL RESOURCES THAT ARE NOT. IT I KNOW THE FOUR STAR BURNING TODAY SO IT'S NOT OUT OF THE PUBLIC SIDE YOU KNOW FROM FRONT AND CENTER BUT THAT'S WERE. INVOLVED IN GOOD GOVERNANCE AND WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE PLANNING FOR THESE THINGS IN ANTICIPATING THEM CENTER STERN EUROPE. THANKS MISTER CHAIR- THANKS IS CASH AND SO FAR. I LIKE. MISTER BROWN I DO NOT HAVE A LEAF BLOWER AND GAS POWERED LEAF BLOWER I HAVE A LOADING TRUCK IT IS BY THE WAY I DON'T THINK ELECTRICALLY POWERED- SO. WE ALL OF OUR ZOOM CHALLENGES MORNING PLEASE BEAR WITH ME TOO- IT IS. COMMON IN QUESTION- AND WE SORT OF FRAME THIS DISCUSSION AS THE ONE OF THE DECISION POINTS BEING- WE PURSUE EARLY ACTION. AT MY COMMENT IS THAT I. MY UNDER I DON'T THIS DOESN'T FEEL LIKE EARLY ACTION TO ME IT FEELS LIKE LEFTOVER WORK WE SHOULD HAVE DONE LAST YEAR- RIGHT AND I JUST WANTED. GET THIS SERVICE STRAIGHT FROM A IS THE BUDGETING STANDPOINT THAT. THE REVENUES THAT ACCUMULATED OVER THE COURSE OF LAST YEAR WERE NOT APPROPRIATE AGE- AT THE END OF SESSION. THE LEGISLATURE DIDN'T DIDN'T MAKE THOSE APPROPRIATIONS AND SO MONEY IS BEEN PILING UP. ADMITS DEBT AND ECONOMIC- DEVASTATION THAT WE LIKE WE'VE REALLY NEVER SEEN BEFORE SO I MY QUESTION IS ABOUT. HOW FAST WE CAN GET MONEY OUT THE DOOR TO GET PEOPLE BACK TO WORK IN CALIFORNIA AND HOW- HOW HOW IT'S HOW IT'S WORKED IN THE PAST IN TERMS OF TIMELINE. SO LIKE HOW TO SET SOME REASONABLE EXPECTATIONS- AND HOW WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO LEVERAGE- THE KIND OF FUNDING WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE WITH. WHAT WE HOPE WILL BE SOME ACTION FEDERALLY. THE HOUSE PASSED A ONE POINT FIVE TRILLION DOLLAR- HI MAKING INFRASTRUCTURE ORIENTED BILL LAST YEAR- AND WE KNOW THE SENATE'S CONSIDERING SOMETHING SIMILAR AND THIS ADMINISTRATION WAS GOING THROUGH THEIR SORT OF COVERT. PLAN IS ALSO BY ADMINISTRATION APPEARS TO BE INTERESTED IN. MAKING GOOD ON THE PRESIDENT'S PROMISE- FOR A MULTI TRILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT IN CLIMB IN INFRASTRUCTURE SO WHEN IT COMES TO SORT OF PRIMING THE PUMP AND GETTING DOLLARS MOVING QUICKLY SO THAT. WE CAN BE READY IN THESE PROGRAMS- SORT OF GO THROUGH THE FITS AND STARTS MAYBE. WE CAN GET LIKE ONE OR TWO SNAPSHOTS OF EXPECTATIONS FOR SPEED AND TIMING IF WE WERE TO TAKE SAY EARLY ACTION- NOT JUST ON WILDFIRE BUT- MORE BROADLY ON THE SORT OF. CLIMATE INFRASTRUCTURE. WE START GETTING PEOPLE BACK TO WORK. SO MAYBE I KNOW ONE OF THE MOST JOBS INTENSIVE SECTORS. IS OUR FOREST HEALTH AND FIRE PREVENTION SECTOR. IN CHIEF PORTER I APPRECIATE- THE- YOU KNOW THE SCRUTINY YOU'VE YOU YOU ABSORB FROM THOSE OF US IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND GOING INTO THE DETAILS OF ALL THESE PROGRAMS AND TRYING TO MAKE IT WORK FOR. YOU KNOW OUR OUR CERTIFIER ECOLOGIES DOWN IN SOCAL BUT I WILL SAY YOU KNOW ON THE WHOLE THIS THIS PROGRAM THE ANALYSIS WE'VE SEEN FROM FROM LIKE UCLA LUSKIN CENTER DID ONE RECENTLY- V. SINGLE MOST. ARE JOB PRODUCING GIGI ARE ASKED INVESTMENT WE'VE MADE THUS FAR HAS BEEN FORCED HEALTH ON A DOLLAR FOR DOLLAR BASIS. SO BECAUSE IT IS SO PEOPLE INTENSIVE IS MY UNDERSTANDING SO IF WE WERE TO TAKE EARLY ACTION STATE IN ACCORDANCE WITH WHAT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED OR- THE LEGISLATURE ACTUALLY TRY TO PUSH YOU GUYS A LITTLE FURTHER I THINK THE CHAIR JUST ALLUDED TO IT I THINK WE CAN DO MORE. I DON'T WANT TO UNDER SHOOT THAT'S MY BIGGEST CONCERN GOING INTO THIS FIRE SEASON NOT OVER SHOOTING- BUT HOW FAST CAN CAN WE MOVE CAN CAN WE BEAT. THIS FIRE SEASON- IN TERMS OF GETTING DOLLARS OUT INTO COMMUNITIES ON EVERYTHING FROM FORESTRY PROJECTS TO FUEL BREAKS TO FIRE SAFE COUNCILS TO COMMUNITY HARDENING I MEAN HOW FAST CAN CAN WE WILL. SENATOR STERN- THANK YOU AGAIN TOM PORTER CHALFORD RECTOR ST FORSTER- I AM GOING TO JUST TOUCH ON THIS AND I'M GOING TO PASS THE TORCH TO ASSISTANT DEPUTY DIRECTOR. A LOT OF US FOR MORE DETAIL. JUST IN GENERAL WE- THIS IS A VERY LONG TERM ISSUE AND WHERE WE DO PROJECTS WE WILL HAVE- IMPORTANCE- BENEFIT TO THOSE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE IN THE IN AND AROUND THOSE AREAS AND THOSE WIL LANDS. BUT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO MAINTAIN A LONG TERM INVESTMENT TOWARD EARLY ACTION WILL GIVE US- A SIGNIFICANT. LEG UP ON SOME PROJECTS THAT WILL AFFECTED PIECES AND PARTS OF THIS COMING SEASON. ABOUT MORE IN THE COMING SEASONS- ASSISTANT DEPUTY DIRECTOR LOUDEST. THANK YOU DIRECTOR PORTER THANK YOU SENATOR- IN G. LOUDEST ASSISTANT DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR CLIMATE AND ENERGY THE CALIFORNIA AT FIRST I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR RECOGNIZING THE AFFECTS THAT- THAT ARE FUNDING HAS HAD ON STIMULATING JOBS AND THE ECONOMY IT'S OUR SMALL OVERSTAFFED FAVORITE REPORTING METRICS TO COLLECT AND IT'S HAPPENED TO. YOU KNOW GET EMAILED AROUND EVERYWHERE WHEN THE DATA COMES IN BECAUSE WE FEEL THE IMPACT THAT IT HAS IN THOSE COMMUNITIES AND IT'S EXCITING TO US AS ELL WE'RE VERY READY TO- TO AT I HAVE MOVED ON GETTING FUNDS TO OUR PARTNERS WITH THIS EARLY ACTION FUNDING AND I BELIEVE THAT OUR PARTNERS ARE ALSO EAGER TO GET GOING ON THE GROUND BOTH BECAUSE THEY HAVE PEOPLE WHO. ARE READY TO GET TO WORKING WOULD LIKE TO GET TO WORK- AND BECAUSE THEY UNDERSTAND- THAT EVERY DAY WEEK AND MONTH OF WORK COUNTS TOWARDS A POTENTIALLY CHANGING THE EFFECTIVE A WILDFIRE IN THEIR COMMUNITIES. I WOULD LIKE TO- BY NOW- AND REINFORCE SOMETHING THAT DIRECTOR PORTER HAS SAID WHICH IS THAT FOR THE PROJECTS- IT IS IT IS ONGOING WORK EVERYTHING THAT WE DO- HAS THE POTENTIAL TO HAVE AN EFFECT AS SOON AS IT IS DONE- AND THAT GETTING STARTED QUICKLY AT COULD HAVE AFFECTS THIS FIRE SEASON AND IF T DOESN'T THEN COULD HAVE A GREATER EFFECT IN THE NEXT FIRE SEASON I WENT AND WORKED WELFARE'S STRENGTH RELATIVE TO OUR PROJECTS ARE. THE REALLY THE SOONER WE CAN GET GOING THE BETTER IN AND GETTING STARTED IS THAT THE MORE IMPORTANT THING TO FOCUS ON RATHER THAN WHEN THOSE PROJECTS- PUT INPUT FINISHED IS THERE ARE CONTINUOUSLY WORKED ON. THANK YOU OR YOUR TIME YEAH OF COURSE ISN'T THERE I KNOW MISTER BENSON HAD HIS HAND UP BUT IS THERE ANYTHING WE CAN DO TO TARGET THESE. FUNDS- IN LINE WITH SOME OF EQUITY. AND LABOR PRINCE THAT BEEN. SORT OF- TRYING TO LOOK AT MORE BROADLY IS A STATE I THINK IN TERMS OF HOW WE RECOVER- I'M THINKING OF YOU KNOW THE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES OUT THERE- THAT HAVE BEEN HIT IN THE LOOK AT THE SOME OF THE SET SEVEN CALIFORNIA WILDFIRES THAT HAVE BURNED THROUGH IN. COMMUNITIES LIKE IN THE SAN GABRIEL VALLEY OR GRATTAN ST BERNARD DINO WERE RIVERSIDE COUNTY HAVE AS THEIR BEEN ANY THOUGHT TO BUILDING SOME EQUITY METRICS AS WELL AS- ALSO TRYING TO UP LIFT ON THE WORK FORCE SIDE I'M TO THE MISTER BROWN'S LEAF BLOWER- EXAMPLE YOU KNOW WE TEND TO DENIGRATE LANDSCAPE. AND HOME HARDENING TYPE JOBS AND TREAT THEM AS YOU KNOW MERE LEAF BLOWING OR OR- BRUSH CLEARANCE THAT GOES TO MANY WORKERS WHO YOU KNOW DON'T HAVE BENEFITS ARE CERTAINLY AREN'T INTO A UNION BUT BUT YOU KNOW MAYBE TREAT IT IS SORT OF- SECOND TIER WORKERS IN LABOR BUT ANY THOUGHTS ON ON UP LIVE THERE IN IN THE WORK FORCE AND WAYS TO GET PEOPLE. THE CHIEF PORTERS POINT I GUESS ON A ON A LONGER TERM TRACK AS WE GO LONGER TERM DO WE BUILD THE NEXT GENERATION OF SORT OF FIRE RESILIENCY WORKERS ACTUALLY MAKE THIS A LONG TERM CAREER I'M WONDERING JUST QUICK. THOUSAND SORRY MR BENTSEN FOR. IN YOUR AND REYES. I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THEM- HERE CAL FIRE WE DO SEE LANDSCAPE MANAGEMENT AS A AS AN IMPORTANT CAREER WORTHY OF LIFETIME ACHIEVEMENT AND GOAL- THE IT'S CERTAINLY AT ANY TYPE OF LAND BASED LABOR CAN BE HARD AND HOT AND NOT VERY ATTRACTIVE BUT- IT COMPLETELY INTEGRAL TO EVERYTHING THAT WE DO- AND SO OF COURSE THERE'S ALWAYS SPACE. TO THINK MORE ABOUT WHAT WE'RE DOING AND WHETHER WE CAN INCREASE THE INTENDED. IN THE FACTS OF OUR ACTIONS I WILL SAY THAT WE DO CONSIDER- LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES- IN OUR GRANT SCORING BOTH FOR FOREST HEALTH AND FIRE PREVENTION IT'S AN IMPORTANT- CRITERIA. OF PROJECTS GET MORE POINTS FOR THE EFFECTS THAT THEY HAVE THERE AND WE DILIGENTLY COLLECT DATA ON ON WHERE WORKERS ARE I THINK EVEN TO THE POINT OF WHERE WORKERS ARE LIVING- TO SEND SURE THAT WERE REACHING DOWN INTO THOSE aMUNITIES- AND SO AND- I WILL. WOULD LIKE TO BOTH RECOGNIZE THAT- THAT WE CAN ALWAYS. WE CAN ALWAYS PROBABLY LOOK AT WHETHER THERE'S MORE WE CAN DO AND I WILL SAY THAT WE- HAVE REALLY BEEN FOCUSING- IN. HOW WE CAN WORK MORE WITH COMMUNITIES IN THE VERY FAR SOUTHERN PORTION OF THE STATE AND FINING SOME SUCCESSES ON A YEAR TO YEAR BASIS AND SO. ON AND SO. YOU KNOW MAYBE OUR NUMBERS WILL BE EVEN GREATER IN THE FUTURE BUT ALSO TO SAY THAT IT IS ALREADY A PRIORITY AND SOMETHING THAT WE- WE CERTAINLY VALUE. AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO. MISTER BRANSON WITH FINANCIAL RECOGNIZE. I THINK KNOWING JUST PROTECT ON SPRUCE BRIEFLY THAT PART OF THE EARLYACTION STRATEGY HERE TO READ EVERYTHING. HELLFIRE SAID IN TERMS OF GETTING BENEFITS AS FAST AS WE CAN BUT- GETTING STARTED EARLY ALSO HELPS US TO BUILD TRYING TO LEVERAGE ADDITIONAL FEDERAL FUNDING BOTH IN THE CAN ASSIST ME IN THE HARDENING AND WELL AS A LOT OF OTHER PROGRAMS- WITHIN CAN THIS. HAVE FIRE REPORTS RESILIENCE- YEAH STRATEGIES. IS AND IT'S THOSE WORTH NOTING AS WELL THAT IT NEARLY START- DOES HELP IN THAT REGARD AS WELL. EKEUS OF THE FOLLOW UP AND CENTER STERN'S QUESTION WE HAVE BEFORE US A HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS HIS FOR THE HEALTHY AND RESILIENT FOREST PROGRAMS HE'S LOOKING AT. SORT OF COLLECTIVELY OTHER PARTNERS I REMEMBER FROM LAST WEEK WE TALKED ABOUT EARLY MONEY OR MONEY TO GO TO THIS YEAR CONSERVANCY IN THE TAHOE CONSERVANCIES I'M WONDERING. REGIONALLY LIKE THE SAN GABRIEL OR SANTA MONICA ARE THERE OTHER CONSERVANCY THAT ARE IN THE QUEUE OR ARE HAVE. RESILIENT FORESTRY PLANS THAT WULD BE CONSIDERED WITH THIS EARLY ACTION MONEY OR IS THAT. FOR ANOTHER DAY. I DON'T REPRESENT SAN GABRIEL OR SANTA MONICA I'M JUST ASKING. HERE TOM PORTER I'M TO GIVE A VERY QUICK ANSWER- THE. THE REGIONAL AREAS ARE NOT FULLY SET UP YET THAT'S PART OF THAT OTHER BUDGET PROPOSAL AND THOSE PLANS WERE TO DEVELOP UNDER THAT THERE ARE PROJECTS OF VERY LARGE NUMBER OF PROJECTS THAT ARE AVAILABLE FOR- FUNDING- THAT ARE NOT CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH A REGIONAL PLAN BUT WILL BE PART OF THAT REGIONAL PLANS ACCOMPLISHMENTS ARE GOING FORWARD THAT WE WILL LOOK TO FUND THROUGH ANY EARLY ACTION ALONG WITH OTHER A VIABLE PROJECTS. OKAY SO SENATE MCGUIRE. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE CHAIR- I'M GONNA CHANGE DIRECTION JUST A BIT TO GO BACK TO THE NEWER- SO LONG SIR SURE AND I JUST WANNA IS A- HOW GRATEFUL I AM TO SECRETARY ROSS. FOR HER LEADERSHIP OVER THE MANY YEARS HE'S BEEN IN THIS ROLE IN PRIOR- AND THOROUGHLY ENJOY WORKING WITH HUMANA SECTOR IN YOUR TEAM. BUT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT METHANE EMISSIONS- ESPECIALLY THAT REDUCTION FROM DAIRY AND LIVESTOCK OPERATIONS IN WHAT I BELIEVE WAS A COMMITMENT. TO DAIRY FARMERS ACROSS THE STATE WHEN INITIALIZATION WAS PASSED IN WHERE I FEEL LIKE WE HAVE DROPPED THE BALL. IN FISCAL YEAR TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN ADMINISTRATION OR PERFORATED. AT THE BROWN ADMINISTRATION PROVIDE FIFTY MILLION. THEN IN SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN NINETY NINE MILLION MISAPPROPRIATED. I THEN LAST YEAR TWENTY NINE MILLION WAS APPROPRIATED EXCUSE ME TWO YEARS AGO 222-000-1820 TWENTY NINE MILLION WAS APPROPRIATED. LAST YEAR NOTHING. AND NOW WE'RE LOOKING AT LOANS. AND HERE'S WHAT I CAN SAY AT LEAST ON THE NORTH COAST I CAN'T SPEAK FOR THE CENTRAL VALLEY. BUT WE KNOW THAT THERE IS STILL SIGNIFICANT NEED. FOR MANURE MANAGEMENT OBVIOUSLY WERE NOT DIGEST OR COUNTIES BECAUSE WE HAVE PASSED YEAR THE MANURE MANAGEMENT AND ASSISTANCE ON THE NORTH COAST THE VAST MAJORITY OF DAIRY FARMERS IN THE NORTH COAST OUR SMALL FAMILY FARMERS. AND WE ALSO KNOW THAT MANY OF THEM BASED OFF OF THE CHALLENGES WITH NO PRICING OVER THE LAST COUPLE YEARS ARE HANGING ON BY A THREAD. IN WHAT I AM REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT IS SADDLING THEM WITH MORE DEBT- TO BE ABLE TO DO THE RIGHT THING AS THEY ARE NOW. BEING MANDATED TO DO. I THINK THAT THEY ARE MORE THAN WILLING TO COMPLY BUT- IT SIMPLY MOVING THIS INTO THAT CATALYST FUND- I'M REALLY CHALLENGED TO BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND WHY. ESPECIALLY NOW THAT THE PROGRAM WS OVER SUBSCRIBED- WE'RE NOT CONTINUE TO INVEST- AS WAS ORIGINALLY PROMISED AN IDEAL. IN MADAM SECRETARY I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WANT ANSWERS HER I SHOULD GO TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. THE CLERK ROSS. YEAH SURE- AND I APPRECIATE- YOUR COMMENTS SENATOR- AND OBVIOUSLY THE JERRY FAMILIES IN THE STATE HAVE REALLY. ON STEP AND VERY POSITIVELY INTO THE SPACE AND ARE REAL LEADERS IN SUSTAINABILITY OF THE WORK THAT THEY'VE DONE ON. NOTHING REDUCTION- AND THEY ARE MAKING TREMENDOUS PROGRESS TOWARDS OUR INVESTED AND JERRY NOTHING REDUCTION OF APPROPRIATIONS OVER THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS OVER THE LIFETIME OF THESE. PROGRAMS ALMOST TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS HAS BEEN FOR DEREK I JUST OF TECHNOLOGY. BUT IMPORTANTLY ABOUT SEVENTY MILLION DOLLARS HAS BEEN INVESTED FOR- NONTECHNICAL MAR- DRIVING YOUR MANAGEMENT PROJECTS COMPOST BARNS. AT TYSON VERY NICELY TOWARD HEALTHY SOILS PROGRAM. ALL OF THESE PROJECTS HAVE GENERATED FOUR HUNDRED AND TWENTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS IN MATCHING FUNDS. BOTH A JERRY FAMILIES AS WELL AS BY GESTURE. DEVELOPERS WE ARE AT A POINT OF MATURATION IN THESE PROGRAMS THAT HARD DECISIONS HAVE TO BE MADE. WITH A SCARCE DOLLARS THAT WE HAVE- WE ARE VERY OPTIMISTIC BASED ON PRELIMINARY STATEMENTS NOT ONLY FROM- PRESIDENT BIDEN BETTER ALSO HIS NOMINEE. WHO HOPEFULLY WILL BE CONFIRMED NEXT WEEK SECRETARY VILSACK. ABOUT THE DESIRE OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO CONTINUE TO INVEST IN THESE TYPES OF PROGRAMS THAT WE THINK THAT. OUR TRACK RECORD HERE- AND THAT EAGERNESS WITH WHICH I JERRY FAMILIES HAVE HAVE FOLLOWED THESE PROGRAMS THAT THEY ARE WELL POSITIONED FOR FEDERAL DOLLARS. IN ADDITION TO WHERE IT MAKES SENSE FOR THEM. EITHER FOR A LOAN GUARANTEE. FOR A LOW INTEREST LOAN FROM THE CATALYST FUND. THANKS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY THANK YOU IN A CENTURY LOOK I'LL. JUST FOLLOW UP WITH A QUICK COMMENT- BOTTOM LINE IS THAT DAIRY DIJO IN THIS IS WELL AWARE OF THIS REALLY WELL SUITED FOR CENTRAL. ON THE MINORE MEASURE SIDE ESPECIALLY. SCOTT IS NORTH COAST. THE VAST MAJORITY OF THOSE FOLKS HAVE THREE HUNDRED HEAD OF CATTLE. THREE HUNDRED IN A TRYING TO MAKE IT WORK WITH REDUCE NO POPS IS AN INSTABILITY IN THE MARKET SO I THINK AGAIN NGUYEN RIGHT NOW INSURANCE MISTER LARA WAS A SENATOR IN ADVANCE THE BILL THAT SET THIS TARGET ON- THE DAIRY INDUSTRY- AND FEEDLOTS THERE IS A COMMITMENT THAT THERE WOULD BE MONEY THERE TO BE A TO MAKE THAT TRANSITION GARY FARMER SIGNED ON TO THAT COMMITMENT AND NOW WE'RE SEEING THE BEST WE CAN DO IS PROVIDE THEM WITH A LOAN WHEN THEY ARE READY ARE LOW AND THEY HAVE LOANS- UP THE HILL. I DID THEY'RE HAVING TO BE A TO PAY OFF TO GO TO KEEP THEMSELVES IN BUSINESS SO I WOULD HOPE THAT THE SENATE IS GOING TO DO SOME ADDITIONAL WORK ON THIS BECAUSE IT'S CRITICAL TO ENSURE THAT THEY'RE ABLE TO ACHIEVE THE SUCCESS THAT THEY ARE NOW MANDATED TO BRING FORWARD THANK YOU THE SECRETARY BLOOM FOR YOU HAVE THAT ON THE SAME THEME SHORT TERM CLIMATE POLLUTANTS WE'VE GOT NOTHING FOR REFRIGERANTS AND NOTHING FOR OUR WASTE DIVERSION HAS JUST SORT OF BEEN THE HALLMARK BACKBONE PROGRAMS FOR HERE FOR THESE REALLY. BAD FIND IT. NOW AIR POLLUTION CLIMB- WHY. IT SEEMS LIKE THOSE ARE IT IS JUST WE CAN RELY ON LOANS OR WHAT WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IN THESE TWO AREAS. THE VIJAY THAT AND PJ- SENATE DEMS LOOK Y. AS A QUESTION AND- THE LAUREL- SB. THIRTEEN EIGHTY THREE- YEAH IT FEELS A SHOULDER CLIMATE POLLUTANTS WHETHER THAT. METHANE COMING. FROM LANDFILLS ALBANY- ALL. FROM THE WAY THEY'VE RE REFRIGERATE- AERIALS- THE AND SUPERMARKETS- SO ON THE CRIME INCLUDE- COBB HAS SOME OF THE MOST- REGULATIONS ON WALKS. A REFRIGERANT CAN BE USED INSTEAD OF REALLY S. AND NOT SAVINGS AB CHAT IN THAT- REFRIGERATION PROGRAMS OF THE MORE THAN COMPENSATE MOST OF THE FACILITIES- AND IN TERMS OF. MEDIA MANAGEMENT- AND THE WHOLE PANOPLY OF ISSUES IN THIRTEEN EIGHTY THREE- LIKELY- YOU'RE GONNA GET- DIRECTO R. WAGON A LATER IN THE DAY- YOU CAN TALK MORE EXPLICITLY ABOUT THIRTEEN EIGHTY THREE BUT- YEAH WE- TO SIGNATURE ROSSES POINT REALLY LOOKING AT THE CATALYST FUND. THINK ABOUT HOW TO LOSE SOME OF THESE TECHNOLOGIES HOLE WOULD THAT HAVE MATURED WHEN YOU LOOK AT ADOPTION BECAUSE- WE'RE LOOKING AT. MOVING PEOPLE I THE CAB AND THEN REPLY. INCENTIVES WHERE WE CAN- WE LEARN FUNDING AND OPULENT- THE GOAL IS TO GET PEOPLE TO JUST ADOPT THOSE BEHAVIORS SO THAT'S KIND OF THE OCT AND MANY DIFFERENT TECHNOLOGIES ARE AT DIFFERENT PLACES WITHIN THIRTEEN EIGHTY THREE- I DID WANT TO GO BACK TO THE SENATE TO STAND QUESTION A MAYBE LEFT- DEPUTY. DIRECTOR SANCHEZ ADDRESSES WHICH WAS ABOUT HOW I LOOK AT THE ACTION- IS A BIT OF AN- MISS. FRAMING IT REALLY IS- I'LL I'LL LET AND THEY'RE PRETTY SANCHEZ TOLD YOU THIS BUT IT'S- IT'S A CONTINUATION OF THE PROGRAMS I WANTED JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT WAS PLAY I DON'T KNOW IT.

I'M AT SIX ONE SEVEN WAS PASSED BY THE LEGISLATURE IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN TO SET UP A NEW PARADIGM FOR HOW CARBON ENGAGES COMMUNITIES TO ADDRESS THE LIVING LEGACY OF THE STRUCTURAL RACISM. IT'S PAST GOVERNMENT POLICIES. THAT HAVE PLAYED A ROLE IN THE HIGHER LEVELS OF AIR POLLUTION IN DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. AS IT AS ENVISIONED BY THE LEGISLATURE SB SIX ONE SEVEN HOLDS GREAT PROMISE TO BE A POWERFUL TOOL TO ADVANCE EQUITY. AN ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE IN CALIFORNIA. THE LEGISLATURE THAT TWO PER. IN FISCAL YEAR SEVEN EIGHTEEN IMPLEMENT AB SIX ONE SEVEN. FIFTY OF THEM WERE APPROVED WITH PERMANENT FUNDING AND BECAUSE THIS WAS A NEW PROGRAM AND WE WEREN'T SURE ABOUT THE WORKLOAD AT THAT TIME. TWENTY TWO WERE APPROVED WITH TEMPORARY FUNDING. I REQUEST TWO DAYS TO PROVIDE ONGOING FUNDING FOR THESE TWENTY TWO EXISTING PERMANENT POSITIONS.

WORK WITH LOCAL AIR DISTRICTS TO RIPON RESPOND TO THE COMMUNITY'S CONCERNS. BAKER CILLA TAKE. CROSS AGENCY COORDINATION. THESE FUNCTIONS ARE FUNDAMENTAL TO AB SIX ONE SEVEN IMPLEMENTATION ON ARE CRITICAL TO FOR FILLING THE PROMISE.

MORNING TERM MEMBERS IT IS SO GOOD TO BE HERE THIS MORNING- THANK YOU SO MUCH I AM I WILL KEEP MY REMARKS VERY BRIEF THIS MORNING I KNOW YOU ALL HAVE HAD. A VERY LONG MORNING AND AS YOU KNOW CAL RECYCLE PLAYS A VERY IMPORTANT% ROLE IN ACHIEVING OUR ECONOMIC RECOVERY EQUITY AND CLIMATE GOALS AND THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET OUTLINES HOW SUCCESSFUL CALIFORNIA CIRCULAR ECONOMY. AND WILL CREATE JOBS REDUCE WASTE AND SHE CRITICAL SHORT LIVED CLIMATE AT EMISSION REDUCTIONS I'M WITH THE AVERAGE AG CALIFORNIA GENERATOR- HE'S BEEN CALIFORNIA GENERATING OVER A TON OF TRASH EACH YEAR A LENT- AND LANDFILL WASTE BEING THE THIRD LARGEST SOURCE OF METHANE. IT IS CRITICAL TO GET- OUR PROGRAMS HERE IT COVERS I GO BACK ON TRACK I HAD TO MEET OUR WASTE REDUCTION RECYCLING GOALS I'M BOTH THE BCPS BEFORE YOU TODAY ARE AIMED AT DOING JUST THAT THE FIRST OF WHICH AS YOU MENTIONED SHARE IS THE FIVE MILLION DOLLARS- EARLY ACTION ITEM. AND OR AT AN EXPANSION OF THE BEVERAGE CONTAINER RECYCLING PROGRAMS PILOT PROJECTS AS YOU AS MANY OF YOU ARE AWARE AND YOU AND HAVE EXPERIENCED. IN YOUR DISTRICTS I'M- RECYCLE REDEMPTION OP. HAVE DISCRETE INCREASED AND SIGNIFICANTLY OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS AND HAVE BEEN FURTHER EXACERBATED BY THE COBIT PANDEMIC- THIS PILOT PROJECTS. AND EXPANSION WILL GIVE US THE OPPORTUNITY TO ASSIST THOSE JURISDICTIONS IN UNDERSERVED AREAS OF THE STATE TO PROVIDE REDEMPTION OPPORTUNITIES I HAD TO CONSUMERS- AND RURAL SUBURBAN AND URBAN AREAS THAT ARE CURRENTLY UNDERSERVED. EXCELLENT I WILL NOTE ON PAGE THIRTY FOUR OF THE STAFF REPORT WE HAVE A LITTLE CHART OF THE CONVENIENCE SOUNDS WE'RE MISSING ANOTHER BULLET THAT WOULD BE THE EXAM CONVENIENCE SUNSET THE THOUSAND AND ONE AND THEN THAT WOULD ACTUALLY ADD UP THAT WOULD GET A 100% WE'VE MISSED A LITTLE NUMBER THERE SO THAT'LL BE GOOD- LET'S SEE ALEJO. MISTER BROWN YOU'RE BACK GOOD MORNING AGAIN- SO- JUST TO KIND OF LEVEL SAID A LITTLE BIT JUST TO MAKE SURE THE COMMITTEES CLEAR SO THAT PROPOSAL IS FOR FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN THE CURRENT YEAR AS WELL AS FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN THE BUDGET YEAR WHICH WOULD BE AVAILABLE TO EXPAND THE PILOTS CURRENTLY THERE ARE- THE LEGISLATURE IS ALREADY PROVIDED FIVE MILLION IN THE PREVIOUS YEAR TO. IMPLEMENT UP TO FIVE I WOULD SWITCH THE DEPARTMENT IS DOING NOW- AND SO THIS WOULD ADD ANOTHER. TEN MILLION AND WOULD ALLOW THE DEPARTMENT TO EXPAND FROM FIVE PILOTS TO SEND PILOTS OUT OF TIME- SO WE THINK THE PROPOSED EXPANSION FROM FIVE PILOTS TO UP TO TEN PILOTS HAS A LOT OF MERIT AND IS IT IS KIND OF A REASONABLE EXPANSION AND I THINK IT MAKES SENSE TO EXPLORE. ADDITIONAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR DIFFERENT RETENTION MODELS IN DIFFERENT JURISDICTIONS SO WE DON'T HAVE ANY ISSUES OR CONCERNS WITH THAT I THINK OUR MAIN CONCERN IS WAS JUST THE SCALE OF THE FUNDING REQUEST ASSOCIATED WITH THAT EXPANSION- AGAIN THERE'S A CURRENTLY THERE OF THE LEGISLATURE IS ALREADY PROVIDED FIVE MILLION FOR FIVE PILOTS THIS WOULD BE. A TEN MILLION FOR FIVE MORE PILOTS SO IT'S KIND OF DOUBLE THE FUNDING FOR PILOTS- AND SO WE DON'T THINK THAT THAT'S REALLY JUST PROPORTIONAL WITH KIND OF THE EXPANSION IS BEING REQUESTED NO THE MINISTRATIONS INDICATED% THAT PERHAPS SOME OF THE MONEY WOULD BE USED TO EXTEND SOME PILOTS AND- THAT MIGHT BE REASONABLE IN SOME CASES BUT WE THINK KIND OF PROVIDING FUNDING. IT WOULD BE AVAILABLE FOR EXTENSION AS LITTLE BIT PREMATURE UNTIL I KIND OF WE GET TO THAT POINT AND THE ADMINISTRATION MAKES AN ARGUMENT ABOUT THE FUNDING DOES NEED TO BE EXTENDED AND THAT COULD BE REVISITED- IN AT A FUTURE DATE SO OUR RECOMMENDATIONS ARE ARE TO REDUCE THE FUNDING TO FIVE MILLION TOTAL INSTEAD OF TEN MILLION- SIMILAR TO- ONE OF THE PREVIOUS ITEMS WE DON'T FEEL THAT THERE'S ARE PARTICULARLY STRONG CASE FOR IT IS NEEDING TO BE EARLY ACTION IN THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT WANT TO CONSIDER PROVIDING NOT FIVE MILLION. JUST AS IT'S KIND OF OVERALL A BUDGET YEAR PACKAGE AND THAT WOULD ALLOW IT TO EXPLORE SOME. OF THE DETAILS OF HOW THAT THE TIONAL PILOTS TO BE AMPLE. WHAT YOU'RE A- SAY. THE MIGHT BE ABLE. AND TYPES OF. MODEL MIGHT BE A- AND THEN. WERE RECOMMENDED THE LEGISLATURE ADOPTS- REPORTING LANGUAGE- AS PART OF BUDGET TRAILER BILL LEGISLATION- OUR INTENT HERE IS NOT TO CREATES. A LOT OF ADDITIONAL WORK FOR THE DEPARTMENT TO GIVEN THAT THESE ARE. HIGHLIGHTS ONE OF THE MAIN GOALS IS TO EVALUATE HOW EFFECTIVE SOME OF THESE DIFFERENT MODELS ARE. I DON'T UNDERSTAND IS THAT THE DEPARTMENT WILL BE COLLECTING INFORMATION ON RETENTION RATES AND COSTS OF THE PILOTS AND- I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR THE LEGISLATURE. TO HAVE GOING FORWARD AS IT CONSIDERS WHETHER OR NOT TO EXPAND SOME OF THESE MODELS- MORE BROADLY. THE STATE AND SO I MEAN SOME REPORTING LANGUAGE REQUIRING THE DEPARTMENT TO REPORT SOME OF THOSE OUTCOMES OF THE LEGISLATURE CANNABINOID PERMISSION WE THINK. OTHERWISE THIS WILL BE SANTA MONICA ALL OVER AGAIN I WOULD SAY THE FIRST OF ON BEFORE WE GET TO CENTER DOLLY- THIRTY WAGNER OR- FINANCE. ANY PROBLEM ON THE REQUEST FOR REPORTING LANGUAGE AND HOLD MY HAND HERE OF. OF ONE FIVE MORE AND LET'S SEE WILL WILL DEAL WITH THE MONEY LATER HOW DOES THAT LOOK LIKE THE EARLY ACTION VERSUS THE REGULAR. YEAR WE'RE HERE. FEBRUARY MARCH WHAT WOULD BE ACCOMPLISHED WITH EARLY ACTION VERSUS JUST WAITING TILL JULY ONE. ED THANK YOU TERRAE CASSIDY AND SO. TWO THINGS ON THAT FIRST IF I COULD TAKE THAT AND THAT THE LARGER APPROPRIATION FIRST AND THE REASON THE DEPARTMENT IS ASKING FOR TEN MILLION DOLLARS IS TO ALLOW US THE FLEXIBILITY TO EITHER GO BACK TO SOME OF THE EXISTING PILOT PROJECTS- AND EXPANDS THOSE OR TO ALLOW THESE ADDITIONAL FIVE PILOT PROJECTS TO BE FUNDED A SLIGHTLY HIGHER LEVEL DEPENDING ON WHAT TYPES OF. EITHER TECHNOLOGY OR REGIONS THAT ARE BEING SERVED WE HAVE SOME JURISDICTIONS THAT ARE INDIVIDUAL CITIES AND THEN LIKE IN CINEMA COUNTY WE HAVE FIVE CITIES THAT ARE WORKING TOGETHER AND YOU HAD IMPLEMENTED A PILOT PROJECT AND ALLOWING US A SLIGHTLY HIGHER LEVEL OF FUNDING WOULD ALLOW US FLEXIBILITY TO DO MORE REGIONAL SOLUTIONS AS OPPOSED TO TRYING TO- HE SAT TOGETHER WITH INDIVIDUAL JURISDICTIONS. AND THE EARLY ACTION ITEM WAS SPECIFICALLY ASKED FOR BECAUSE WE HAVE CERTAIN JURISDICTIONS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA LIKE THE NORTH COAST THAT ARE CURRENTLY COMPLETELY I'M SERVE THEIR CONVENIENCE THE CLOSEST CONVENIENCE DOWN SERVICE- TO HUMBOLDT COUNTY RIGHT NOW IS IN CINEMA COUNTY- THE CLOSEST OPEN TRANSFER FACILITY IS UP AND CRESCENT CITY AT SO WE WOULD REALLY LIKE THE OPPORTUNITY TO OPEN UP THE GRANT PROGRAM AGAIN IN THE CURRENT YEAR. TO WORK WITH THOSE REGIONS OF THE STATE THAT ARE CURRENTLY COMPLETELY UNSERVED OR SEVERELY UNDERSERVED AND WE CANNOT DO THAT UNTIL WE RECEIVE THE STATUTORY AUTHORITY FROM THE LEGISLATURE TO DO THAT AND THE FUNDING TO- APPROVED THOSE BRANDS. SENATE ALWAYS HAVE SOMETHING SAY ON A COMMUNITIES YEAH. THE BASIC AT THE END OF YOUR COMMERCE THERE'D ADDRESSED WHAT I WANT I DEFINITELY THINK YOU NEED ONE RULERS AYE. I KNOW CENTER REQUIRED I HAVE A DISTRICT TO LOOK ALIKE AND THERE IS A ZERO SERVICE SO THEY NEEDED TO DEFINITELY I SEE DAILY- SAID THERE WAS MERIT SIND INTO DOING A RULED PART OF IT I THINK WE SHOULD ADD TO GET THAT INFORMATION OUT AS WELL. OKAY WE'RE GOING TO KEEP THIS ITEM OPEN WHICH ARE. ONLY SIX. ONLY CENTER MCGUIRE VERY QUICK AND IT JUST FIRST AND FOREMOST I JUST WANT TO SAY. CONGRATULATIONS THE DIRECTOR. AND REALLY APPRECIATED DIRECTORS- DIRECT INVOLVEMENT IN SOME OF THESE ISSUES- IT'S A BREATH OF FRESH AIR. ALL OF THE VERY QUICKLY SECURE AND JUST SAY THIS. THE REDEMPTION ISSUE IN RURAL CALIFORNIA. IT'S A HOT MESS. HOTNESS AND IT'S BEEN A HOT MESS. UP FOR A FEW YEARS NOW. IT WOULD APPRECIATE THE DIRECTORS APPROACH IS NOT LOOKING AT A ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH. IN UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE. A FEW COUNTIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE THAT ARE IN LINE THAT COULD POTENTIALLY BRING FORWARD A SUCCESSFUL PROJECT. IT WOULD HOPE. I AND I KNOW THE CHAIR IS WORKING WITH THE DIRECTOR. BUT I WOULD HOPE- THAT WE COULD LOOK AT EARLIER ACTION BEFORE JUNE- AND NOT WAIT TODAY BECAUSE I THINK THAT THERE ARE. WILLING ENTITIES GO TO MOVE FORWARD ON A CREATIVE SOLUTION THANK YOU SO MUCH RESEARCHER. IS HER THERE WERE MORE APPLICANTS THAN THAN FIVE THAT REQUIRE FUNDED ON THEIR CURRENT. OF BILINGUAL. TOUGHER OKAY. THAT IS CORRECT. OKAY ARE WE WILL KEEP YOUR ARTICLE NO WE WOULD HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH PROVIDING LEGISLATIVE REPORTING AND AS A LONG TIME AS YOU KNOW A LONG TIME POLICY WONK AND THE TRUE SUCCESS AND VALUE OF A PILOT PROJECT IS BEING ABLE TO. LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENS IN A PILOT PROJECT IN THE LEGISLATURE TO EVALUATE WHETHER OR NOT THAT IS A SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM THANK YOU ON THAT LET'S MOVE TO THE HI AT THE NEXT ORGANIC WASTE REDUCTION PROGRAM AND THE COST OF IMPLEMENTATION ACCOUNT. YES THANK YOU SO MUCH TERRY HOUSEKI AND AS YOU KNOW- SB THIRTEEN EIGHTY THREE BY SENATOR LARA WAS PASSED IN TWENTY SIXTEEN- REQUIRING A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT MEASURES TO CONTROL ORGANIC WASTE.

AND IS- IN TWENTY TWENTY TWO- AND OUR GOAL IS TO HIT AND 50% REDUCTION IN OUR ORGANIC WASTE BELOW OUR TWENTY FOURTEEN BASED CLIENT AND WE ARE ACTUALLY CURRENTLY RIGHT NOW ABOVE OUR TWENTY FOURTEEN BASELINE. SO WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND AS YOU ALSO KNOW THOSE TARGETS ARE A STATE WIDE TARGET THEY ARE NOT JURISDICTION BY JURISDICTION AND SO IT'S REALLY COMING UPON US THAT COVERS CYCLE WITH YOU IN THE LEGISLATURE.
