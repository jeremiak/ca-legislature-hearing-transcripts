AND THEN GO TO PUBLIC COMMENT AFTER THAT. SO I'M JUST GONNA START MY OPENING WITH MY OPENING STATEMENT AND ALLOW OUR OUR- VICE CHAIR TO SEE IF HE HAS ANY OPENING STATEMENTS A SEAT AND IF ANY OTHER COMMITTEE MEMBERS HAVE OPENING STATEMENTS BUT- AS WE ALL KNOW THE- COVERT NINETEEN. PANDEMIC WITH SOME THAT WE FOR C. THIS MERGES SEE WHICH IS USUALLY YOU USUALLY WITH MOST DISASTROUS THERE ARE DISCRETE. AND THEY IMPACT A CERTAIN NUMBER OF PEOPLE THIS IS A DISASTER THAT IS IMPACTED ALL FORTY MILLION CALIFORNIANS. WORLD BOOK BEFORE WE DO MY OPENING COMMENTS WE GOT GOT A SIGNAL TO TAKE BRAWL SO LET'S LET'S ROLE IN ESTABLISH FORMS SO. TANG HERE OBERNOLTE I. BLOOM HERE BRO YOUR FONG HERE KERR. SMITH GREAT IT'S AGAIN IT BECAUSE THIS PANDEMIC WAS UNFORESEEN IN BECAUSE IT'S AFFECTING EVERY SINGLE CALIFORNIAN IN OUR STATE- WE BEFORE WE LEFT APPROPRIATED ONE POINT ONE BILLION DOLLARS IN EMERGENCY FUNDS TO THE GOVERNOR AND WE ALSO AUTHORIZED THE DISASTER RESPONSE EMERGENCY OPERATIONS ACCOUNT TO ACCEPT. OTHER RESERVE FUNDS SO WHEN WE DID THIS- FIVE WEEKS AGO I THINK THIS SENSE WAS THIS IS GOING TO BE A DISCRETE DISASTER FOR STERN AMOUNT OF TIME- THAT AT SOME POINT THAT THIS WOULD BE OVER. NOW THAT WE'VE BEEN IT IS FOR ABOUT FIVE WEEKSTHIS OF PANDEMIC COULD LAST SIGNIFICANTLY LONGER LIFE MAY NOT COMPLETELY RETURN TO NORMAL AND TELL WE HAVE A VACCINE INTEL WE HAVE ACTUALLY HAVE- TESTING EVERYWHERE THAT'S YOU READILY ACCESSIBLE IN SO GIVEN THAT I THINK WE WANT TO GET A BETTER SENSE OF- BASED ON WHAT WE- KNOW TODAY- HOW HOW LONG IT'S- GONNA GO FOR. AND THE WHAT THE BUDGET EXPECTATIONS ARE GOING TO BE UP I FIRST I JUST WANT TO REALLY COMMEND THE GOVERNOR FOR HIS EXTRAORDINARY ACTION. LEADING THE STATE AND REALLY- WORK WITH ALL OUR COUNTY OUR CITY LEADERS IN DOING EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO THE CURVE ARMS PROUD OF THE EVERY CALIFORNIA. AND THE RESPONSE ACROSS OR WE'VE SEEN OUR IN THE STATE ALL OF US POINT OTHER WORKING WITH OUR FIRST AND THE INDUSTRY BUT THEN ALSO. WERE I EVERYBODY WHO YEAH I GET YOUR EVERYONE WHO OPENING SINGLE PHARMACY. EVERY SINGLE DAY WE SO MANY WHO ARE. TO GO TO WORK EVERY DAY TO KEEP US SAFE KEEP US HEALTHY KEEP AS FAT AND WE'VE ALL DONE AN AMAZING JOB OF WORKING. TOGETHER BUT WITH THE GOVERNOR'S LEADERSHIP WORKING WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ALSO WORKING WITH OUR HEALTH CARE WORKERS AND REALLY MAKING SURE THAT. WE HAVE BEEN AHEAD OF THIS CURVE NOT BEHIND IT- ONE THING THAT I'VE ALWAYS RESPECTED THE MOST ABOUT THE GOVERNOR IS HE'S ONE OF THE MOST TRANSPARENT PUBLIC OFFICIALS I'VE EVER KNOWN GOING BACK TO HIS TIME. WHEN HE WAS MY MAYOR IN SAN FRANCISCO- IN TODAY'S COMMITTEE IS ALL ABOUT TRANSPARENCY WHERE WE'RE GOING TO BE ASKING QUESTIONS TO GET A BETTER IDEA OF WHAT THE SCOPE. ENDEMIC YOU KNOW WHEN HOW LONG LAST FOR. WHAT WE THINK WILL BE THE EXPENDITURES ARE WE KNOW THAT BEFORE WE LEFT IT WAS A BILLION DOLLARS THAT WAS APPROPRIATED BUT NOW THE UNDERSTANDING IS THERE COULD BE SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS THAT WILL BE SPENT TO RESPOND TO THIS PANDEMIC IN CALIFORNIA THAT WE KNOW OF- OBVIOUSLY. THE ASSUMPTION IS THAT THE BULK OF THAT MONEY WILL BE- WILL BE REIMBURSED BY FEMA BUT ALSO ON WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE UNDERSTAND. WHAT WON'T BE WELL WILL BE AND WHAT ARE SOME OF THE SPECIFIC ISSUES REALLY ARE COMMITTEE TODAY IS TO PROVIDE THE PROPER OVERSIGHT OVER THAT SPENDING BUT ALSO TO BE A PARTNER. IN THAT PROCESS. WE KNOW THAT THERE IS A MODEL THAT HAS BEEN DRIVING THE THINKING OF THE STATE OF THE GOVERNOR- WE THINK THAT'S I PERSONALLY THINK THAT'S GREAT THAT PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS ARE DRIVING THE THINKING. ARE REALLY DRIVING THE RESPONSE HOWEVER THE MODEL THE STATE HAS PUT FORWARD- SAYS IT'S OUR PEAK IS AROUND MID MAY. WHEN THE OTHER PUBLIC MODELS HAVE THE PEAK AS A WEEK AGO SO WE JUST ONE UNDERSTAND WHAT THE DIFFERENCES WERE SOME OF THE DIFFERENCES IN THE ASSUMPTIONS. AND REALLY- OR STAND WITH THE DIFFERENCE OF A PEAK IN MID MAY WHAT DOES THAT MEAN IN TERMS OF THE STATE'S RESPONSE IN TERMS OF EXPENDITURES. BUT ALSO. WHAT THAT MEANS ABOUT WHEN WE MAY EVEN BE ABLE TO ANTICIPATE. GETTING BACK TO. WORK AND- OPENING BACK UP THE STATE AGAIN WHILE WE ALSO WANT TRANSPARENCY REGARDING WHAT THE FUTURE LOOKS LIKE WE ALSO NEED TO KNOW I GET A BETTER SENSE OF. WHAT HAS BEEN SPENT AND WHERE THE RESOURCES HAVE BEEN DEPLOYED- SENSE ALL EIGHTY OF US HAVE BEEN HOME IN OUR DISTRICTS WORKING IN VERY CLOSE CONTACT WITH OUR CITIES ARE COUNTIES OUR OUR HOSPITALS ARE HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS. WE ARE CONSTANTLY HEARING AND BEING ASKED ABOUT- WHERE THE PP IS- HOW HOSPITALS GOT CHOSEN TO OPEN. WHERE RESOURCES ARE BEING DEPLOYED. HOW DECISIONS ARE BEING MADE IN TERMS OF WHO'S MAKING DECISIONS AROUND THE HOTELS AND MOTELS FOR OUR HOMELESS POPULATION- INCENSE. INFORMATION HASN'T ALWAYS READILY- BEEN FLOWING BETWEEN THE ADMINISTRATION'S LEGISLATURE TODAY WE'RE TRYING TO REALLY GET A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT- INFORMATION AVAILABLE. INFORMATION WE CAN CONTINUE TO SHARE WITH OUR CONSTITUENTS WILL BE CAN SHARE WE ALL ARE VERY SLOW. GOVERNMENT OUR PARTNER AND THE HEALTH CARE AND WE WERE TO BE ABLE TO. GET THAT RISK TO THE IN BILL TIME SO WERE ASKING- WHAT WHAT IS AVAILABLE IN TERMS OF INFORMATION AS WELL AS WHAT CAN BE- SHARED AND HOPEFULLY WE CAN THE SYSTEM. COMPRISED THAT INFORMATION SO THAT THAT PUBLIC CAN REALLY SEE IT IN IN REAL TIME SO AGAIN MUCH EASIER IF WE CAN JUST DIRECT PEOPLE TO A WEBSITE THAT'S BEING UPDATED REGULARLY RATHER THAN. GETTING ON PHONE CALLS AND GETTING INFORMATION THAN HAVE TO DISTRIBUTE THAT INDIVIDUALLY- IN IN A MUCH LESS EFFICIENT WAY. SO AGAIN VERY- VERY THANKFUL THAT WE HAVE NUMBER OF PANELISTS FROM THE ADMINISTRATION TODAY I WILL BE GETTING THEM TO A SECOND I JUST WANTED TO FIRST TURN OVER TO AB OTHERS MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE TO SEE IF ANY OPENING COMMENTS- MISERABLE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AT AN HONOR TO BE BACK WITH YOU AND AN HONOR TO SEE EVERYONE IN PERSON AGAIN. THE pPOIGNANT. NOT JUST FOR US BOARD FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS. AND I THINK WE'RE ALL AWARE THE DEGREE TO WHICH CALIFORNIANS ARE HURTING WE HAVE PEOPLE THAT ARE OUT OF WORK WHERE PEOPLE HAVE PEOPLE WHO ARE STRUGGLING TO PAY THE RENT. PEOPLE WHO ARE ILL PEOPLE WHO ARE DYING- IT'S HUMBLING THOUGH TO THINK THAT THE DECISIONS THAT WE MAKE HERE IN THIS ROOM. AFFECTS THE ABILITY OF THE STATE TO RESPOND TO THAT CRISIS AND OUR ABILITY TO HELP PEOPLE WHETHER IT AND GET THROUGH IT. SO AS THE CHAIR SAID THE PURPOSE OF THIS HEARING IS TO CONDUCT OVERSIGHT OVER THE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS THAT THE STATE IS SPENDING IN RESPONSE TO THIS CRISIS. IN THE COURSE OF THIS HEARING. WE'RE GOING TO ASK SOME POINTED QUESTIONS WE'RE GONNA ASK SOME DIFFICULT QUESTIONS WE'RE GONNA HAVE SOME UNCOMFORTABLE QUESTIONS BUT I WANT TO MAKE IT VERY CLEAR. THAT OUR INTENT HERE IS TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS MONEY IS WISELY APPROPRIATELY SPENT. WE ARE STILL ALL ON THE SAME TEAM HERE. WE ALL HAVE THE SAME GOAL WHICH IS TO PARTNER WITH THE GOVERNOR AND OUR COLLEAGUES IN THE SENATE TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS MONEY GETS TO WHERE IT NEEDS TO GO ON THAT CALIFORNIA GETS THROUGH THIS. AS QUICKLY AND AS PAINLESSLY AS WE OSSIBLY CAN SO- MISTER CHAIR IT'S AN HONOR TO BE WORKING WITH YOU TODAY AND I YOU BACK. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR FOR CALLING THESE HEARINGS ON THE SUBJECTS AT. THIS IMPORTANT TIME. I LOOK FORWARD TO THIS HEARING ON THE DETAILS ABOUT THE MODELING. ON WHICH THE GOVERNOR'S ROAD MAP FOR MODIFYING AND ARE STAY AT. HOME ORDER IS BASED. IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT FOR US TO UNDERSTAND THE RATIONALE FOR. THE DETAILS OF. AND THE REPORTING BACK EXPECTATIONS. FOR THE EMERGENCY EXPENDITURES THAT HAVE BEEN PROVIDED TODAY. WHILE I APPRECIATEWHAT WE ARE FOCUSING ON TOGETHER IN THE PUBLIC EYE. RIGHT NOW I'M ALSO LOOKING FORWARD TO WHAT WE WILL DISCUSS ON APRIL TWENTY SEVENTH REGARDING RECOVERY MISTER CHAIR. I'D LIKE TO TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY IF I MAY TO BRIEFLY OUTLINE THE TOP ISSUES THAT ARE ON MY MIND AS WE MOVE FORWARD. THE CRISIS AND OUR RESPONSE IS A MARATHON AND NOT A SPRINT AND I'M MINDFUL AS THE CHAIR OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE THAT DEALS WITH HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES. OF THE LONG TERM PRESSURES IMPACTS DEMANDS AND PROTECTIONS THAT WE NEED TO KEEP IN MIND OF FOR THE HEALTH ACCESS AND SOCIAL SAFETY NET. I'VE BEEN VOCAL MY SUPPORT FOR THE GOVERNOR FOR THE DISASTER RELIEF AND EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE FOR THE UNDOCUMENTED COMMUNITY. WHILE THE FEDERAL RESPONSE DOESN'T RECOGNIZE THE SUPPORT THAT THIS WORKING COMMUNITY NEEDS. DURING THIS UNEMPLOYMENT CRISIS AND PANDEMIC CALIFORNIA HAS SHOWN LEADERSHIP ON THIS BASE. MORE NEEDS TO BE DONE FOR SURE AND THIS POPULATION WHICH WILL REQUIRE OUR SUPPORT SO THAT THEY CAN WEATHER THIS DEVASTATING TIME. EMERGENCY FOOD SUPPORT IS ANOTHER ISSUE OF GRAVE CONCERN. DEMANDS ON OUR FOOD BANKS ARE ESCALATING WITH EVERY PASSING DAY PRIORITIZING EMERGENCY FOOD SUPPORTS AND CAL FRESH NEEDS NEED TO BE AT THE HEART OF OUR HEALTH AND SAFETY RESPONSE. SENIORS AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES ARE BY DEFINITIONS. AT RISK IN THIS PANDEMIC AND MARSHALL MARSHALLING RESOURCES FOR THEM. AND THE PROGRAMS ON WHICH THEY RELY IS AN ABSOLUTE MUST RIGHT NOW. THIS INCLUDES OF COURSE OUR IN HOME SUPPORTIVE SERVICES AND ADULT PROTECTIVE SERVICES. SECONDLY WHILE ONLY EVER SUGGESTS THAT CALIFORNIA MAY ESCAPE THE EMERGENCY ROOM CRISES THAT WE ARE SEEING IN NEW YORK ITALY AND ELSEWHERE. THE EPICENTER OF CALIFORNIA'S CRISES SEEMS TO BE UNFOLDING WITHIN OUR NURSING HOMES. THE LIVES OF OUR MOST VULNERABLE RESIDENTS HAVE BEEN LEFT IN THE HANDS OF A WORK FORCE THAT IS INSUFFICIENT AT SIZE IN SIZE EVEN IN THE BEST OF TIMES. BEYOND TO NURSING HOMES ARE HEALTH CARE WORK FORCE OVERALL WAS RECOGNIZED TO BE WOEFULLY INADEQUATE PRIOR TO THIS PANDEMIC. NOW WE ARE WATCHING THAT THIS WORK FORCE IN KING COMPONENTS OF OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM SLIP AWAY AS THE WORLD STAYS HOME. FOR GOING EVEN NON EMERGENCY MEDICAL CARE. WE ARE SEEING MASSIVE FURLOUGHS LAYOFFS AND OORS CLOSING AND COMMUNITY CLINICS HOSPITALS BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CARE SETTINGS DENTAL CARE AND MORE. WE WILL NEED THIS WORKFORCE NOW MORE THAN EVER ONCE WE ENTER THE RECOVERY AND REBUILDING PHASES. AMONG OTHER STRATEGIES TELEHEALTH IS NOT A TEMPORARY SOLUTION IT IS OUR NEW NORMAL AND THEREFORE IT MUST BE SUPPORTED AND EXPANDED WELL BEYOND THIS PANDEMIC. FINALLY NONE OF US CAN IGNORE THE SECONDARY CRISIS THAT IS UNFOLDING BEFORE OUR EYES IN THE FORM OF INCREASES IN ALL FORMS OF FAMILY VIOLENCE AND IN BOTH FAMILY BASED AND COMMUNITY TRAUMA. UNEMPLOYMENT COMBINED WITH ISOLATION AND GRIEF IS A PERFECT RECIPE FOR NEW EPIDEMICS OF MENTAL ILLNESS SUICIDALITY SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND ADDICTION. ARGUABLY CALIFORNIA WAS NOT MEETING ITS NEEDS IN THIS AREA BEFORE THE PANDEMIC AND NOW WE ARE AN UNPRECEDENTED CRISIS HEADED OUR WAY. MY WORK WHICH IS WITHIN SOMEONE CALLS ON BOTH A HUMAN AND A HUMANE INSTINCT IN EVERY SENSE TO SHOW COMPASSION TO VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES AND TO FIGHT FOR THE RESOURCES THEY NEED TO SURVIVE. I PLAN TO PLAY THIS ROLE FULLY AS WE GO THROUGH THIS CRISIS AND EVENTUALLY COME OUT OF IT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR FOR ALLOWING ME TO PROVIDE TIME FOR THIS THANK YOU DOCTOR ABOUT. EIGHT MISTER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE AND FILL IN FOR MY ESTEEMED COLLEAGUE DR WEBER I THINK TWO VERY IMPORTANT THINGS TO NOTE AS WE GO THROUGH THIS PROCESS TODAY IS THAT WE WANT TO ENSURE THE CALIFORNIANS ARE REASSURED THAT THE DECISIONS THAT ARE BEING MADE IN SACRAMENTO AND OUR SUPPORT FOR THE WORK OF THE GOVERNOR AND HIS TEAM CONTINUED BE BASED ON THE HIGHEST ORDER SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE THE BASS MODELING AND ENSURING THAT WE HAVE THE HIGHEST AND BEST USE OF THE STATE'S RESOURCES. IN DEPLOYING ADDITIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE TO GET US THROUGH THIS CRISIS- SECONDARILY BECAUSE THIS IS BEING LIVE STREAMED- TO THE ENTIRE STATE I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT A NUMBER OF MEMBERS PRESENT ON THE PANEL TODAY COME FROM COUNTIES WHERE FACE COVERINGS ARE RECOMMENDED AND SO YOU SEE THAT REFLECTED IN THE PANEL HERE HERE IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY THEY ARE NOT RECOMMENDED AT PRESENT BUT THAT'S WHY YOU SEE A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SOME MEMBERS ARE WEARING FACE COVERINGS AND SOME MEMBERS NOT TO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE PUBLIC TO UNDERSTAND THAT. THANK YOU MISTER. MISTER BROOKS THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN THE FIRST I'D LIKE TO SAY HAPPY SIXTEENTH BIRTHDAY TO MY SON CONNOR WILL BE WITH THEM- LATER ON AFTER AFTER WE CONCLUDE THE HEARING I ALSO WANT TO A PAST MY CONDOLENCES ON OF THOSE CALIFORNIA'S AFFECTED BY THIS VIRUS. I WANT TO THANK THE FRONTLINE WORKERS THE DOCTORS THE NURSES THE MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS. WHO ARE DOING THE LORD'S WORK AND PROTECTING OUR STATE I ALSO WANT TO. SPEND TIME TALKING ABOUT SMALL BUSINESSES OF MY DISTRICT ARE HIT VERY VERY HARD THESE HOURLY WORKERS THE BARTENDERS THE WAITRESSES WHO ARE FILING FOR UNEMPLOYMENT IT'S BEEN THE NUMBER ONE CALL IN OUR IN OUR DISTRICT OFFICE- SOME OF THESE BUSINESSES MAY NOT REOPEN- THE NEXT COUPLE HEARINGS I WANT TO FIND OUT WE GET. TESTING DONE MORE QUICKLY- SPECIFICALLY THE IMMUNITY TESTING THERE'S THE STANFORD STUDY THAT CAME OUT THIS WEEK SAYING TAT THIS MAY HAVE GONE THROUGH- MANY PEOPLE IN THE WINTER AND THEREFORE THEY MAY BE A MEDIA. I ALSO WANT TO TALK ABOUT. LOCAL CONTROL BECAUSE NOT ALL AREAS OF THE SAME IN MY COUNTY OF ORANGE. NOW WE'VE GOT FOURTEEN HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE CASES OUT OF THREE POINT THREE MILLION PEOPLE YOU KNOW DO WE NEED TO LOCK DOWN. TO THE EXTENT THAT WE ARE NOW. AND IF WE IF WE DO OPEN HOW DO WE- NAVIGATE OUR NEIGHBORING COUNTY LOS ANGELES THAT'S THAT'S BEEN MORE IMPACTED LIKE TO HEAR SOME. SOME ANSWERS TO THAT YOU KNOW QUARANTINE IS SUPPOSED TO BE FOR SICK. NOT HEALTHY. THE P. PLEASE I MEAN THERE'S A STORY OUT IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN THAT WE ABANDON OUR STOCKPILE AS OTHER STATES IN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DID. LIKE TO GET QUESTIONS TO WHY THAT HAPPENED- THESE CALLS WE'VE BEEN ON SINCE. MARCH HAVE GIVEN US THE THIRTY THOUSAND FOOT VIEW OF NUMBERS AND STATS AND- I DON'T WANNA GET DEEPER INTO WHERE THESE MASTER GOING IN. AND ISSUES LIKE THAT. THE CONTRACT WITH THE MASKS IS SOMETHING I'D LIKE TO DISCUSS. I KNOW FOR A FACT THAT THEIR SALE COMPANIES LEOTARD COMPANIES LOCAL ALTERATIONS IN MY DISTRICT. THAT ARE MAKING MASS RIGHT NOW IN THESE DAYS THIS IS COULD HAVE USED TO BOOST- MAYBE WE SHOULD DIVERSIFIED INTO A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT COMPANIES- NOT JUST ONE CONTRACT I'D LIKE TO HEAR SOME ANSWERS TO THAT- BUT AGAIN. PROUD TO BE PART OF THIS MISTER CHAIRMAN AND I LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING FROM OUR PANELISTS. THANK YOU MISTER BROWN. ANY FROM THE COMMITTEE. POUGHKEEPSIE SEEING NONE WE ARE GOING TO GO TO OUR FIRST PANEL TO DISCUSS CALIFORNIA'S CODED NINETEEN INFECTION HOSPITALIZATION AND MORTALITY PROJECTIONS I BELIEVE WE HAVE MISTER GULAR DO CHIEF FROM- YES AS WELL AS MISTER- MY CHECK FROM- HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY. AVAILABLE REMOTELY. GOOD AFTERNOON OR GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FALL DIRECTOR COLOR DO CHEN AYE ARE HERE AT THE STATE OPERATIONS CENTER JOINING YOU FOR THIS HEARING- I WILL START BY- GIVING YOU AN OVERVIEW OF OUR MODELING WORK TODAY- AND THEN WE CAN- JUMPING TO YOUR QUESTIONS. WE DO HAVE A SHORT POWER POINT PRESENTATION- THAT WE ARE READY TO PUT UP ON THE SCREEN SO I'LL JUST GIVE THAT  SECOND AND THEN I'LL BEGIN MY REMARKS. AND THANK YOU FOR. TAKING THE TIME AND WE ARE. GRATEFUL TO YOU FOR GIVING US THIS OPPORTUNITY TO BE PART OF THIS HEARING TODAY. I BEFORE I WALK YOU THROUGH. OUR MODELING EFFORTS I WANT TO PRACTICE AND MIGHT REMARKS WITH THREE DISTINCT. PIECES OF INFORMATION THAT I THINK WILL PROVIDE YOU WITH A LITTLE BIT OF CONTEXT AS TO HOW WE ARE USING. OF MODELING AND DATA TO INFORM OUR DECISION MAKING HERE AT THE STATE OPERATIONS CENTER. FIRST I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT AND UNDER I UNDERSTAND THAT ALL MODELS INCLUDING THE MODEL THAT WE ARE USING. HAVE A HIGH. HIGH SENSE OF UNCERTAINTY. AND PART OF THAT IS BECAUSE THE SIGNS THE EVIDENCE BASE. FOR THE BASIC ASSUMPTIONS THAT WE'RE USING IN THESE MODELS. IS NOT ONLY THE FACT THAT THE EVIDENCE BASE AND THE SCIENCE IS BEING BUILT EVERYTHING HEY. SO IT'S IMPORTANT UNDERSTAND THAT THERE IS A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY THIS BOTTLE AND ALL MODELS BECAUSE OF THE BASIC ASSUMPTIONS. BEING MADE AT. THIS POINT THAT I. IS THAT. THERE ARE BOTH OF BOTTLES. AVAILABLE AND THERE IS A OF NO WITH REGARDS THE MILE. AND I THINK MODELING. HELP SAID LOOK AT RATIONALITY BUT I THINK DOES NOT GIVE A- CERTAIN FACTS OF WHAT. HAPPENED ON THE GROUND AND SO IT'S- IMPORTANT AS YOU LOOK AT BOTH THE BOTTLE AND ALL AUTO CENTER. PRESENT ACROSS STATE THAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT OUT. OPENLY IN THE SENSE THAT IT REALLY DOESN'T. ALL OF OUR BUT IT HELP UNDER THE JACK CORRECT NOT. THE THIRD POINT THAT I MAKE IT. DATA IS MOST AND- DATA IN THIS CAR. OR WE AGO WHEN WE- WITHIN THE OPERATE OR AT LEAST A TERMS OF. AROUND THE- WE DID NOT HAVE AN DAY. WE ONLY HAVE SOME PRETTY OF WERE WORKING ON THAT DATE WE HAVE ACT DATA AND NOT AND- THE ACTUAL DATA IS ON. IMPORTANT IN HELPING US UNDERSTAND THE DIFFERENCES THAT ARE HAPPENING WITH IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO THE ACTUAL DATA IS ACTUALLY WHAT'S GUIDING OUR WORK NOT THE MODELING WORK AND I THINK THAT IS A REALLY IMPORTANT THING HEY. I'LL CLOSE ON THIS SLIDE BY SAYING THAT DIRECTOR GO WOULD YOU CHIEF AND SENATE WE PLAN FOR THE WORST SCENARIO BUT WE ARE HARDEST TO COME UP THE BEST CASE SCENARIO AND THAT'S REALLY THE EFFORTS. WE'VE GOT DONE AT THE STATE OPERATIONS CENTER AND I THINK THAT'S THE CRIME BEYOND MODELING. SO THEY REALLY ARE LOOKING AT SOME OF THE WORST CASE SCENARIOS BUT WE WORK. REALLY RESCUE. SO WE CAN GO. WHAT YOU WILL SEE IS A SCENARIO WITHOUT IN ANY INTERVENTION. THIS IS IF WE IF THE GOVERNOR HAD NOT PUT A STAY AT HOME ORDER IN PLACE AND WE NOT DONE PHYSICAL DISTANCING THE HORIZONTAL LINE THAT YOU SEE ABOVE THE X. AXIS IS OUR SEARCH CAPACITY AND SEARCH CAPACITY WHETHER AN OVERWHELMING TO VERY VERY QUICKLY HAD WE NOT PUT THE STATE HOME ORDER IN FACT WE WOULD HAVE PRINT. MODEL PRINT CLOSE TO HUNDRED HOSPITALS. AS A RESULT OF THE VIRUS AND NO INTERVENTIONS BEING PUT IN PLACE THESE INTERVENTIONS ARE OFTEN CALLED NON PHARMACEUTICAL INTERVENTIONS ARE EMPTY EYES AND THEY INCLUDE THINGS SUCH AS- CLOSING DOWN MASS GATHERINGS I AM PUTTING IN THE STATE OR MORE. AND IMPLEMENTING PHYSICAL THIS. SO IT JUST SENSE OF THE MAC HAD WE DONE ANY. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. THERE WE ARE I LOOK AT THE SONORA. WITH THE IN THAT WE PUT IN PLACE AND WHAT YOU WILL SEE HERE IS A BLUE LINE THAT IS THE MEDIAN. THE SCENARIOS THAT ARE RAN IN THE BOTTLE AND THAT THE CODE THAT YOU SEE HERE. IS FROM THE TWENTY FIFTH PERCENTILE TO THE SEVEN FIFTH PERCENTILE THE RED DOTS THAT YOU SEE HERE- OR THE RED LINE AT THE BOTTOM IS OUR ACTUAL HOSPITALIZATIONS AND WHAT I WANT FOLKS TO TAKE AWAY FROM THE SCREEN IS THAT OUR INTERVENTIONS ARE WORKING EXTREMELY WELL. AND WHAT WE NEED TO YOU CAN THIS ARE WE TO THANK THE GENERAL. REALLY I BY GOVERNOR STATE OR- BECAUSE THE IMPACT IS EVIDENT IN THE DAY THAT WE'RE- SO MOST OF THE SPRAY IF. THE ACTUAL IS THE RIGHT DOT OR THE RED LINE THAT YOU SEE ON THIS PARTICULAR GRAPH. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. HERE WHAT WE'VE MODEL IS IF WE WERE TO LIFT THE INTERVENTIONS AND GO BACK TO NORMAL WHAT WE WOULD SEE IN TERMS OF THE SPY SO THE INITIAL DOTTED LINE WHICH IS LIGHTLY GREAT IS WHAT WE WOULD HAVE SEEN HAD WE NOT DONE ANYTHING THAT I HAD THE BLUE AYE SOLID LINE IS THE MEDIAN WITH REGARDS TO THE MODEL THE RED LINE IS THE ACTUAL HOSPITALIZATIONS. IF I WERE TO LEFT THAT THAT IN NON PHARMACEUTICAL ENGINES YOU WOULD SEE A SPIKE SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT OTHER COUNTRIES LIKE SOUTH KOREA INJURED AND THEY LIFTED THEIR EMPTY EYES AND NOW WE'RE HAVING TO PUT THEM BACK IN PLACE. EIGHTEEN EIGHTEEN FLU PANDEMIC GIVE US SOME GOOD INSIGHTS INTO TERMS OF HOW TO PREPARE FOR LIFTING EMPTY EYES AND IN FACT A NUMBER OF CITIES IN THE UNITED STATES LIFTED THEIR EMPTY ICE TOO QUICKLY AND SAW SIGNIFICANT BY EARLY THIS WEEK THE GOVERNOR LAID OUT SIX DIFFERENT INDICATORS THAT WE WILL BE USING TO GUIDE OUR DECISION MAKING AROUND HOW WE LEFT OR MODIFIED. GUYS MOVING FORWARD THAT VOID THE SIGNIFICANT SPIKE OUT WITHIN OUR CASES IN CALIFORNIA. NEXT LINE I WANT TO CLOSE MY PRESENTATION AND LOOK FORWARD TO ENGAGING WITH YOU IN IN A IN A CONVERSATION BUT I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU FIRST AND FOREMOST FOR HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS AND HOSPITALS WHO REALLY HAVE DONE A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF WORK OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS. AND PUTTING THE EMPTY EYES ARE. SOME PLACE WAS TO PREPARE OUR HEALTHCARE DELIVERY SYSTEM SO THAT IT HAD THE ABILITY TO TAKE CARE OF PEOPLE AND SAVE LIVES. FIRST AND FOREMOST I ALSO WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC BECAUSE THEY HAVE BEEN A BITING BUYERS IN ORDER AND IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT FOR US. TO CONTINUE TO DO THAT IN ORDER FOR US TO BE ABLE TO SAVE AS MANY LIVES AS POSSIBLE MISTER CHAIR I WAS. THERE AND WOULD LOVE TO IN ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MAY. THEY THEY I'D LIKE TO DO IS WE COULD JUST GO TO. ALL THE PANELISTS NAY WILL TAKE QUESTIONS FOR ALL OF THEM WHEN WE- FINISH OF THAT'S OKAY. SO BUT WOULD LIKE TO GO TO THE NEXT PANEL. ALL WHICH IS THE OVERVIEW OF TOTAL AND HEARD IN ANTICIPATED KOBE DISASTER- IN PUBLIC HEALTH RESPONSE STATE EXPENDITURES IN FEDERAL REIMBURSEMENTS. SO FIRST WE'RE GOING TO HAVE- MISTER VETO ANYTHINGFROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. HI MY NAME IS THE LATEST ONE OFTEN AND I'M JUST HAPPY DIRECTOR AT THAT FOR BUDGET AT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND I HAVE SEVERAL MY COLLEAGUES WERE LEADERS HERE AT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ON THE LINE AS WELL TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS I'LL KEEP OPENING REMARKS. NOW WE KNOW THAT WE ARE IN AN UNPRECEDENTED SITUATION BOTH IN TERMS OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND ALSO THE ECONOMIC SITUATION. THAT WE'RE FACING IN ADDITION WE ARE ADDRESSING THESE ISSUES IN THE CONTEXT OF WORKING TOWARD THE GOVERNOR'S. NAME REVISION BUDGET PROPOSAL- WHICH WILL BE SUBMITTED TO THE LEGISLATURE JUST A COUPLE WEEKS FROM NOW. FIND EIGHT FOURTEEN STATUTORY DEADLINE SO PEOPLE MORE TO SAY ABOUT THAT IN THE WEEKS TO COME. BUT I THOUGHT I WOULD MAKE THREE POINTS RIGHT NOW WITH REGARD TO THE SUBJECT OF THIS HEARING. IS THAT MINISTRATION VERY MUCH APPRECIATES THE ESTEY EIGHTY NINE APPLICATION THAT THE LEGISLATURE MADE A MONTH AGO AND WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE LEGISLATURE GAVE A GREATER DEGREE. WHAT DO YOU TRUST MINISTRATION. THAN MIGHT BE DIFFICULT FOR THE STORE OF BILLS GIVEN THE- SO WE ARE. TO PROVIDE AS MUCH INFORMATION ACTUALLY. REGARDING HOW THOSE MY COLLEAGUES AS MY HEALTH. THREE QUESTIONS TODAY. AND WE CAN'T. MAKE TAX YOU AFTER THE HEARING IS IN THIS CALL. THIS POINT IN TO MAKE THAT THERE. CONSIDERABLE I ASKED MR MAKE FROM A- MENTIONED WE ARE DOING PROJECT IN MY- WITH REGARD HOW WE EXPECT THIS PANDEMIC TO GO. BUT THE TRUTH IS NOBODY REALLY KNOWS FOR SURE OUR BEST ESTIMATE RIGHT NOW IS THAT KOBE RELATED EXPENDITURES TO DIRECTLY RESPOND. TO THIS EMERGENCY WILL TOTAL APPROXIMATELY SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS FOR THIS YEAR AND WE EXPECT THE MAJORITY OF THAT TO BE REIMBURSED BY FEMA. FEDERAL. THAT IS. FAST AND WHILE WE TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE- A CATEGORY WHERE WE- THAT FUNDING BE. ARE WE WILL HAVE MUCH MORE TO SAY ABOUT OUR UPDATED ESTIMATES IN TERMS OF OUR SPENDING AND WE ARE PROPOSED ALLOCATED IN THE WEEKS AND MONTHS TO COME. AND THEN THE FINAL POINT THAT I DO WANT TO MAKE A CASE IS THAT SEVERAL SUPPORT IS. ABSOLUTELY KEY OVER HERE CARE ACT INCLUDED ONE HUNDRED FIFTY BILLION DOLLARS IN STATE AND LOCAL EIGHT. WHICH APPROXIMATELY. FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS IS GOING TO CALIFORNIA'S SPLIT BETWEEN STATE AND CERTAIN LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND THAT'S CERTAINLY A GOOD START BUT IT'S NOT A NOT SEEN EVEN MUCH GREATER LEVELS SEVERAL. WELL IN A- TWICE THAT LATER IN THE MINISTRY WILL HAVE. MAKING SO WE ARE TO WORK WITH OUR FEDERAL PARTNERS TO TRY TO GET AS MUCH FEDERAL AID FOR BOTH THE STATE GOVERNMENT IS FALSE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. ALL AND WE HOPE TO WORK WITH YOU ON THAT SUBJECT AS WELL AND WITH THAT I'LL TURN IT OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE TREES A CALVERT. BUT SOME ADDITIONAL DETAIL IN TERMS OF THE EXPENDITURES MAKES DAY. THE MORNING TO RESET COLOR A DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- ALL QUICKLY NOTE THAT OVERALL ALLOCATIONS THAT STARTED IN MARCH THE AGENDA PROVIDES DETAILS ON THESE ON PAGE THREE AND WE ALSO WE ARE VERY IS REPRESENTATIVES FROM FINANCE AVAILABLE TO ADDRESS QUESTIONS ON THESE ALLEGATIONS- FIRST SB. ONE SEVENTEEN THE SITE ON MARCH SEVENTEENTH AND PROVIDED A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES FOR PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT CLEANING AND SANITIZING NUTRITION SERVICES AND DISTANCE LEARNING. I'M SB EIGHTY NINE WHICH INCLUDES SECTION THIRTY SIX WHICH PROVIDES UP TO ONE MILLION DOLLARS IN GENERAL FUND APPROPRIATIONS RELATED TO THE KOBE NINETEEN EMERGENCY. ON THIS FARM SB EIGHTY NINE ON ALLEGATIONS OF TOTAL SEVEN HUNDRED AND SIXTY EIGHT POINT NINE MILLION. AND YOUR PREPARATION IS SUBJECT TO SPECIFIED LEGISLATIVE NOTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS AND WE HAVE BEEN SENDING THOSE. I AM ALSO ON MARCH TWENTY FIFTH THE ADMINISTRATION PROVIDED NOTICE ABOUT ONE POINT THREE BILLION DOLLAR TRANSFER I'M TO THE DISASTER RESPONSE EMERGENCY OPTIONS ACCOUNTS. AND AS HAS BEEN NOTED PREVIOUSLY I AM CALIFORNIA HAS SECURED A RESIDENTIAL MAJOR DISASTER DECLARATION WHICH MAKES FEDERAL FUNDING AVAILABLE AND- OR- TO THE STATE AND REIMBURSEMENT OF MANY OF THE STATE COSTS IN YOUR THAT FEDERAL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCY IS EXPECTED. AND WITH THAT I WILL TURN IT OVER TO THE NEXT PANEL. THANK YOU ARE WE'RE GONNA HEAR FROM MISS. CURRY WITH OUR WE US RUNNING OF MISTER GIVE A DUTY WAS SPEAKING ON HER BEHALF. OKAY GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS COMMITTEE MARK RTG DIRECTOR OF THAT. OFFICE MURDERS YOU SERVICE IS GOING TO BE WITH OU THIS MORNING. LET ME START BY SAYING- THAT THE STATE OPERATIONS CENTER HAS BEEN ACTIVATED. SINCE EARLY MARCH AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL THE SUPPORT STATEWIDE PANDEMIC RESPONSE. ARE ACTUALLY- WE'VE ACTUALLY BEEN COLLECTIVELY BEEN ENGAGE WITH THIS- RESPONDED SO THAT ACTUALLY SINCE ABOUT MID JANUARY WHEN THE FIRST. REPATRIATIONFLIGHTS CAME IN THE CALIFORNIA ROUGHLY ABOUT THREE MONTHS. ALL WE ASK AND THE HEALTH OF HUMANS AGENCIES ARE WORKING- IN A UNIFIED EFFORT RESPOND TO THIS EVENT. WE HAVE OVER THREE HUNDRED PERSONNEL THAT ARE ACTIVATED AT THE STATE OPERATIONS CENTER EITHER REMOTELY OR IN PERSON. YOU'RE OUT MULTIPLE FACILITIES TO ENSURE APPROPRIATE SOCIAL-DISTANCING AND SAFETY. MULTIPLE TEAMS ARE ON THE GROUND IN THE FIELD PROVIDING MEDICAL CARE STAFF TO FOOD BANKS BUILDING FEEL HOSPITALS AND OTHER SUPPORT NEEDS TO OUR COMMUNITIES ARE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. GIVEN THE IMMENSE SCOPE AND SCALE AND COMPLEXITY IS A BAD THIS IS BETTER ALL HANDS ON DECK ALBERT INVOLVING ALL LEADERSHIP. AT EVERY AGENCY IN STATE GOVERNMENT TO SUPPORT LOCAL GOVERNMENT COMMUNITIES. AND THE PUBLIC. WE HAVE MULTIPLE TASK FORCES IN PLACE WORKING TIRELESSLY TO ADDRESS ISSUES SUCH AS HOSPITAL AND MEDICAL BRIDGE. HOUSING IS THAT. I'M ALREADY MOVE. BY. OUR SCHOOL. AS WELL ARE FEDERAL BAR IF. HELP THAT HE SERVICE. AND THE US ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS AND DEPARTMENT OF FATS ARE FULLY ENGAGED STATE OPERATIONS CENTER OR IN THE FIELD SUPPORTING CALIFORNIA'S NEEDS. CALIFORNIA HAS AND WILL CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON PROTECTING OF PROVIDING FOR HEALTH AND MEDICAL SERVICES AND PUBLIC SAFETY PROTECTING THOSE MOST VULNERABLE THE IMPACTS OF COVERT NINETEEN AND PROVIDING ECONOMIC AND OTHER RELIEF YOUR DRASTIC CASCADING IMPACTS. OF THIS UNPRECEDENTED EVENT. I WANT TO CLOSE MY AGAIN THINKING ALL OF THE CALIFORNIANS AND ALL OF OUR HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS WHERE THEY'RE FANTASTIC WORKER COOPERATION AND THE GREAT EFFORT THE FLAT OCCUR. AND HELP SAVE LIVES THIS IS A MARATHON AND WE'RE GONNA BE KEEPING OUT THIS UNTIL- WE ARE HOUSE THIS CHALLENGE AND GETTING BACK TO A NORMAL STATE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. I IN OUR LAST POLLICIS IS MISTER PETTIT ARE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST. OKAY BUT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MISTER VICE CHAIR AND MEMBERS OR INVITING ME TO PARTICIPATE HERE TODAY. I JUST HAVE A COUPLE OF. MINUTES HERE ABOUT COM COMMENTS. I WOULD SAY THE LEGISLATURE CLEARLY HAS RECOGNIZED THAT THE CODED NINETEEN PANDEMIC IS A PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY. AND HAS BEEN ACCOMMODATED TO THE BUDGET AUGMENTATIONS UNDERTAKEN BY THE ADMINISTRATION. AND GENERALLY SPEAKING THE LEGISLATURE'S TECH KNOWLEDGE THE ADMINISTRATION'S NEED FOR OPERATIONAL FLEXIBILITY AND HAS PROVIDED THE CAPACITY FOR IT TO RESPOND SWIFTLY TO THE PANDEMIC. BUT NOW WE'VE MOVED ON FROM THE INITIAL. PHASE OF THIS EPISODE AND IN THE COMING WEEKS THE LEGISLATURE WILL BE TASKED WITH PASSING A FINAL BUDGET PACKAGE. THIS WILL BE TAKING PLACE DESPITE THE CHALLENGING CIRCUMSTANCES. THEREFORE THIS PRESENTS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE STATE TO SHIFT ITS ORIENTATION FROM ONE OF REACTION TO THE PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS TO A MORE PROACTIVE STANCE. IN WHICH MORTGAGE ACTIVITIES ARE PLANNED IN ADVANCE AND INCORPORATE MORE OF A STRATEGIC APPROACH. BUT IN ORDER FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO EFFECTIVELY PARTNER WITH THE ADMINISTRATION. WE BELIEVE THAT THE LEGISLATURE WILL REQUIRE MORE DETAILED INFORMATION. IN BROAD TERMS THE TYPES OF USEFUL INFORMATION THAT THE THAT THE LEGISLATURE WOULD BENEFIT FROM WOULD INCLUDE HOW THE ADMINISTRATION HAS ALREADY RESPONDED. WHAT ARE THE ADMINISTRATION'S PLANS FOR THE COMING MONTHS PERHAPS UNDER MORE THAN ONE SCENARIO. WHETHER IT AND THEN FINALLY WHAT ARE THE COSTS OF THESE PLANS HOWEVER THE COST ESTIMATED AND HOW DOES THE ADMINISTRATION WAS A- FUNDED. THE DATE A LOT OF THE THIS KIND OF INFORMATION AT LEAST IN ANY DETAIL FORM IS NOT BEEN AVAILABLE TO THE LEGISLATURE. AND I MENTION ALL OF THIS JUST AS A REMINDER. THAT IT IS IMPORTANT TO RECALL THAT THE LEGISLATURE. HAS A CONSTITUTIONAL RESPONSIBILITY OF OVERSIGHT AND AUTHORITY OVER APPROPRIATIONS. IN THE MAY REVISION IS THE TRADITIONAL TIME WHEN THE ADMINISTRATION WILL PROVIDE UPDATED INFORMATION ON CASELOADS AND INCORPORATE THEIR EFFECT ON WORKLOAD AND THE ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS. OF PROVIDING WHAT WILL BE CRUCIAL HUMAN SERVICES AND HEALTH CARE SERVICES TO AFFECTED POPULATIONS THIS WILL BE ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT THIS YEAR. LIKEWISE IF NOT SOONER THAN A REVISION WILL BE AN IDEAL TIME FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO HOPEFULLY RECEIVE BACK UP INFORMATION ON THE- SEVEN BILLION AN ESTIMATED INCREASE COSTS RELATED TO RESPONDING TO KOBE NINETEEN. FINALLY I JUST LIKE TO NOTE THAT THE LEGISLATURE ACTING THROUGH THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE BUDGET COMMITTEE. AS CAN KERR HAS- CAN CONDUCTED AN EXPEDITED REVIEW AND CONCURRED WITH THE VARIOUS BUDGET DOCUMENTATIONS UNDERTAKEN BY THE ADMINISTRATION. HOWEVER HOWEVER IN THE COURSE OF PROVIDING THOSE REVIEWS THE JAIL BC HAS SENT TENURE REVIEW LETTERS TO THE ADMINISTRATION. THESE LETTERS HAVE MADE CERTAIN REQUEST OF THE ADMINISTRATION IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE REVIEW. SOME OF THE DATA THAT THE THAT THAT JAIL BC HAS AS INDICATED WOULD BE HELPFUL IS IN INCLUDES ADDITIONAL INFORMATION AND DATA. ON HOW THE FUNDING AUGMENTATIONS HAVE BEEN PUT TO USE EXPLANATIONS OF THE VARIOUS METHODOLOGIES FOR HOW THE NEEDED FUNDING AUGMENTATIONS ARRIVED A. AND HOW CERTAIN FUNDING INCREASES IN PURCHASES OF THE PP WILL BE ALLOCATED ACROSS THE STATE AND EVEN POTENTIALLY OUTSIDE OF THE STATE. THERE'S ALSO BEEN A REQUEST FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO VIEW CERTAIN OPERATING CONTRACTS SUCH AS IN THE CASE OF THE SAINT VINCENT'S HOSPITAL IN THE SEATING MEDICAL CENTER. I THINK IT IS REASONABLE FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO ANTICIPATE RECEIVING AN UPDATE ON THE STATUS OF THESE REQUESTED SOMETIME IN THE NEAR FUTURE. ALL RIGHT THIS WILL CONTINUE TO ASSIST THE LEGISLATURE IN EVALUATING ANY BUDGET AUGMENTATIONS. THEY COME THROUGH AND OF COURSE WE WILL BE WORKING WITH YOU IN THE COURSE OF- REVIEWING THE COMING BUDGET PROCESS. THANK YOU MISS BENNET. OUT WITH THAT WE SHOULD THE PANELISTS FOR THEIR- FOR THEIR CMMENTS WANTED TO TURN IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE TO OPEN UP FOR QUESTIONS. MR OBERNOLTE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR OF MY FIRST QUESTIONS FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. WHEN WE ADJOURNED SIX WEEKS AGO WE PRINT PLACED EXTRAORDINARY TRUST IN THE GOVERNOR WHEN WE PASSED IS BEING EIGHTY NINE AND DELEGATED TO HIM- BILLION DOLLARS OF SPENDING AUTHORITY TO RESPOND TO THE CORONAVIRUS CRISIS SO- IN THE ENSUING WEEKS. THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE BUDGET COMMITTEE HAS BEEN EXERCISING OVERSIGHT OVER THAT SPENDING AUTHORITY IN THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ISSUES US LETTERS ASKING FOR OUR CONCURRENCE IN THE SPENDING ITEMS THAT THEY PROPOSED UNDERTAKE. MOST OF THOSE REQUESTS I HAVE CONCURRED WITH SOME OF THEM I HAVE NOT AND TO ASK ABOUT THAT- THE GOVERNOR HAS SPENT MONEY ON THINGS DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE CORONA VIRUS WERE TALKING ABOUT- FIELD HOSPITALS PER MINUTE PP VENTILATORS MEDICAL PERSONNEL- HE SPENT SOME MONEY ON THINGS THAT WERE PERSONALLY RELATED LIKE OF HOMELESSNESS- THAT'S COULD BE A SUBSTANTIAL VECTOR. SPREAD OF THE DISEASE SO I UNDERSTAND THAT CHILD CARE WE MAKE SURE THAT OUR EMERGENCY MEDICAL PERSONNEL ARE ABLE TO GO TO WORK AND SO CHILD CARE IS IMPORTANT FOR THAT BUT ALSO HE SPENT MONEY. I'M SHORING UP OR SAFETY AND THE IT MIGHT BE. THROUGH THE MIGHT EVEN BE WHY IS A BY BE SOMETHING AGREE WITH WHEN RATING IT. SETTING GOVERNOR. BUT THAT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT I FEEL WAS GIVE HIM THE AUTHOR TO ALLOCATE MONEY FOR UNDER SB EIGHTY NINE I SB EIGHTY NINE THAT SECTION THIRTY SIX THE SECTION WE'RE DISCUSSING SAYS HALF A BILLION DOLLARS IS HEREBY APPROPRIATED FROM THE GENERAL FUND FOR ANY ITEM FOR ANY PURPOSE RELATED TO THE MARCH FIRST FOURTH. SEE UNDER ORDER THE- FINANCE SO THAT'S WHAT IT SAYS IT HAS TO BE REALLY TO THAT PROCLAMATION SO MY QUESTION FOR THE PARMA FINANCES HOW IS SPENDING ON SOCIAL SAFETY NET PROGRAMS RELATED TO THAT PROCLAMATION OF EMERGENCY. THANK YOU MISTER OBERNOLTE FOR THAT QUESTION I'LL SPEAK BRIEFLY AND THEN I MAY TURN IT OVER AS WELL MY COLLEAGUE AND SHE REACHED HHS UNIT HERE AT FINANCE I THINK THE MAIN THING IS. THAT REVIEW ALL THESE EXPENDITURES ASKED WAITED TO THE KOBE NINETEEN EMERGENCY RESPONSE AND SOME OF THEM AS YOU MENTIONED ARE DIRECTLY RELATED TO SCALING. HOSPITALS ARE PASSING THE PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT. BUT FOR SOME OF THESE OTHER CATEGORIES IT'S ALSO ABOUT MINIMIZING IN THE SHORT TERM THE IMPACT ON THE MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS WE KNOW THAT. THEY WERE GOING A COUPLE WEEKS THROUGH THE VISION PROCESS REGION BUDGET ACT MAN IT JUST SO HAPPENSTHAT THOSE DEADLINES WILL BE PRETTY SOON WHEN IT COMES TO SOME OF THE LONGER TURNS ACTIONS THAT WE WILL PROPOSE TO UNDERTAKE. BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT EVEN THOUGH FEDERAL SYSTEMS HAS BEEN THE OVERALL PACKAGE WAS VERY SIGNIFICANT OVER TWO TRILLION DOLLARS THERE WERE A LOT OF GAPS IN THERE SOMEPLACE IS WORKING OR NOT ME TOO WELL SOME PLACES WERE IMPACTED AND CHANGED. DIDN'T NECESSARILY PROVIDE LIMITATION ALL UP THROUGH THAT WE NEED AND SOME PLACES WHERE THERE ARE STILL VULNERABLE. HEALTH THAT ARE GETTING THE MORE THAN EIGHTY EIGHT IN STOCK. AND COURSE EIGHTY NINE. PROVIDED ONE BILLION DOLLARS OVER. THAT'S LESS THAN ONE TENTH OF 1% OF THE WORLD'S DRAWING. NUMBERS ARE PACKED. THE GOVERNOR DIRECTION AND SAID BOTH FOCUS ON UP TO. CAPACITY ALSO ON THOSE MOST. POPULATIONS SO DO VIEW THAT AS TO. RELEVANT ON THE ARE POPULATION THAT NEED RIGHT NOW- AND AS YOU KNOW WITH ASKING LOCAL GOVERNMENT VERY CLOSE PARTNERSHIPS WITH THE COUNTIES IN TERMS OF THE- WORK. REGARDING THE SOCIAL SERVICE PROGRAMS AND FOR THE DETAILS OF THAT SPECIFIC PER DAY YOU ASKED ABOUT ALTERNATE OFFERED. SHE. HELLO THAT- THIS IS ADAM TO RECEIVE THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- SO YES I THINK IF THERE WERE- THERE WERE A FEW THINGS IN THIS AREA THAT WERE- WHERE WE NOTICED AN IMMEDIATE YOU CRITICAL NEED AND ONE EXAM. ALL ALL TAKE IS SORT OF MONEY FOR THE FOOD BANKS. SO FOR EXAMPLE AS THE BIG CRUNCH AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT MADE A SIGNIFICANT. HERE IN- EMERGENCY. THAT'S BUT WHAT WE LEARNED IS THAT WE WERE SEEING AN IMMEDIATE. IS IN DEMAND FOR FOOD ASSISTANCE. AND THE FEDERAL MONEY THAT WAS APPROPRIATED IT I'M WAS NOT GOING TO BE AVAILABLE TILL JULY AND SO THIS WAS AN AREA WHERE. WE SAW AN IMMEDIATE NEED THAT NEEDED TO BE ADDRESSED AND THE FEDERAL INVESTMENT WAS NOT GOING TO IT TO COME FOR A COUPLE OF MONTHS AND SO THE STATE- YOU KNOW WE STEPPED IN AND BEAT INVESTMENT THERE ARE TWO TO FILL THOSE IMMEDIATE NEEDS IS. RESULT OF THE CRISIS. AND SO I DID TO THE TEXAS AND SO WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO ADDRESS- THROUGH THE SB EIGHT AND I PROCESS. RIGHT THANK YOU FOR THE RESPONSE BUT- MY QUESTION WAS NOT WHETHER OR NOT THIS WAS NEEDED. WHETHER OR NOT IT WAS WISE MY QUESTION IS WHETHER OR NOT THE GOVERNOR HAD THE STATUTORY AUTHORITY.TO SPEND THE MONEY ON SOCIAL SAFETY NET PROGRAMS. AND IT'S CLEAR TO ME THAT HE DID NOT. THE DECLARATION OF EMERGENCY WAS VERY DETAIL TO TALK ABOUT FAIR GROUNDS A TALKED ABOUT STATE OWNED PROPERTIES. RESPOND HERS HOSPITALS- MEDICAL PERSONNEL PRICE GOUGING. IT DID NOT TALK ABOUT THE SOCIAL SAFETY NET AND THERE'S A REASON FOR THAT BECAUSE- IN SB EIGHTY NINE THERE'S ANOTHER SECTION WE WOULD TALK ABOUT SECTION THIRTY SIX. AND THIRTY SEVEN SAYS. IT'S THE INTENT OF THE LEGISLATURE THE ADMINISTRATOR CAN WORK WITH STAKEHOLDERS INCLUDING MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE LEGISLATOR AFTER. HELPING SHREDDED TO BE CONSIDERED FOR AN- ON THE BALL. ASSIST VISUAL NONPROFIT WORK SMALL BUSINESS EXPECTING EIGHT. SHIP TO THE IMPACT OF IT. OKAY SO THAT'S BY THE WASTE I JUST READ YOUR- BILL THAT ALWAYS YOU NINE DOES OTHER THAN. DOES A- MARBLE. OF BILLS. HI IT'S SAFE SECTION SIX WE'RE THE GOVERNOR THE A FULL. IN THIS MONEY IN. TO THE FIGHT FIRST ANSWER. SEVEN WE'VE ALLEGE. WOULD LIKE TO PARTNER WITH THE GOV. IN ADDRESSING THE SOCIAL IMPACTS OF CODED THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS SO I FEEL LIKE THE LEGISLATURE'S BEEN BY PASSED ON THIS ISSUE. AND I'D LIKE TO ASK THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TO PLEASE DO WHAT THE LEGISLATION HAS SAID AND PARTNER WITH US. IN SHORING UP OUR SOCIAL SAFETY NET AS WE MOVE FORWARD- I ALSO QUESTION FOR. OH YEAH. NOW WE UNDERSTAND THAT. IF YOU EFFORT. EXPENDED IN OF THESE PROGRAMS FOR THE PROCUREMENT OF PP CREATING A DISTRIBUTION WAREHOUSE IN A SYSTEM FOR GETTING THOSE OUT TO THE- ORGANIZATIONS AND COMMUNITIES THAT NEED THEM- AND WERE I THINK YOU DIED OF A NEW UNITED IN OUR DESIRE TO SEE THAT BE AS EFFICIENT AND X. BUT IT. IS POSSIBLE. AB I'M THOUGHT THINK EVERYONE IS DíAS HAS HEARD STORIES FROM OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES ABOUT. HOSPITALS AND COUNTIES AND CITIES THAT. SUBMITTED REQUESTS FOR PP TO THE STATE AND THEN JUST DIDN'T HEAR BACK SO I'LL TELL YOU SOME STORIES FROM MY OWN DISTRICT- I'VE HAD HOSPITALS THAT SUBMITTED REQUESTS. THAT THEY THEY NEVER HEARD WORD ONE. AND THEN A COUPLE WEEKS LATER. 10% OF THE- TOP. SHOWED UP AND NOTHING WAS SAID AND SO MY QUESTION IS THIS I MEAN WE UNDERSTANDING THAT THIS THIS THIS IS A CRISIS THERE'S A HUGE NEED BUT CAN'T WE BE A LITTLE BIT BETTER AT PROVIDING GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICE. OR IS IT IS A QUICK BUT AT LEAST I THINK RESPONDING TO REQUEST EVEN IF IT'S TO STAY WE GOT YOUR REQUEST FOR PROCESSING AT WORK ON FIRST HEALTH OR- CAN'T FEEL RIGHT NOW WE'RE SORRY WE THINK WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO. AT THIS A CERTAIN DATE IN ORDER YOU KNOW. AT ALL THE BIG 10% I MEAN I. SHOULD BE DOING A BETTER JOB. TO CONVICTING THEIR IN. LIKE TO KNOW IF FOR MAKE OUT AT RISK. SO THIS IS REGARDED YOU THANKS FOR THE QUESTION- I GUESS LET ME START OFF BY SAYING THAT. OF THE SCOPE AND SCALE OF THIS ADVANCE HAS REALLY DICTATED THE NEED FOR US DEVELOPING AND IMPLEMENTING THE MOST EXTENSIVE LARGEST MOST COMPLICATED LOGISTICS DELIVERY AND COMMODITY PROCUREMENT. EFFORT WE'VE EVER DONE IN THE STATE'S HISTORY. IN DOING SO OUR EFFORT HAS BEEN WORKING VERY VERY CLOSE THEY ALL WITH THE EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES AUTHORITY HELP. BUT HELL SUPPORT THEM IN THEIR ACTING COORDINATING HOSPITALS AND- AND COUNTIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE BEING ABLE TO- PROVIDE HE AND OTHER COMMODITIES AS NECESSARY. THAT WAS ALL DONE IN REAL TIME UP WE'VE WE OF COURSE BUILT ON THE EXIST THE WAY WE DO- THIS KIND OF ABANDONED DISASTERS BUT AGAIN THE IT'S NOT- IT'S NOT A COMMON PLACE TO HAVE AN ADVANTAGE ALL FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES. EVERY HOSPITAL IN THE STATE EVERY FIRST RESPONDING AGENCY IN THE STATE IS THE INTERMEDIATE NEEDS OF THESE KIND OF COMMODITIES- SO- THE EFFORT WAS TO FORCE MULTIPLY HERE AND BUILD A VERY EXTENSIVE- CAPABILITY- THAT NOT ONLY INCLUDED- THE OF THE LEVERAGING ALL OF THE STATE ASSETS ARE DEPARTMENT WILL SERVICES AND OTHER. BUT ALSO PARTNERING WITH OUR FEDERAL PARTNERS A FEW OTHER OF FEDERAL AID HHS WORK. TO AS MAY. I'M ALWAYS REPOSSESSED POP LIKE THAT U. S. AT U. S. SAID MAYBE MERCY TO BE ABLE TO LOG WHAT CAPER. BECAUSE THE TIME ON ON. THAT'S JUST. BETTER MORE EFFICIENT AND MORE EFFECTIVE ALSO REAL TIME A WHY WOULD WITH A- WE WERE CARRYING COMMODITIES AND IN A VERY COMPETITIVE MARKET AND BEING ABLE TO GET THOSE THOSE RESOURCES IN. AS FAST WE POSSIBLY COULD AND GET THEM OUT TO THE STATE OUT THROUGHOUT THE STATE LASTLY IN WORKING WITH THE HOSPITAL CARE SYSTEM. THEY ALSO WERE DOING THEIR BEST TO ASSESS WHAT COMMODITIES WERE AVAILABLE IN THEIR HOSPITALS AND THEIR EXISTING PIPELINE AND WE COMPARE THE TWO TO BE ABLE TO. UP A SORT OF A- THE ONE WEBSITE I. OF MOVING THIS FORWARD ALL ABOUT IS YOU. YOU'RE QUITE AN AD UP THIS. HERCULES EFFORT. IN A VERY BROAD SCALE AND THAT- I THINK THAT IT IS SELF OPERATING RELATIVELY OFFICIALLY NOW- AND WILL HOPEFULLY WE'LL GET CONTINUE TO GET BETTER AS THE DAYS AND WEEKS A MOVE ON. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU AND I JUST TO BE CLEAR I MEAN WE WE'RE TRYING TO HELPTHE SITUATION WE'RE ON THE SAME TEAM HERE WE ALL OF US IN GOAL- BUT I'D LIKE TO ASK THAT. WHICH LOOK AT THIS SYSTEM FROM THE STANDPOINT OF THE PEOPLE IN OUR COMMUNITY ASKING SO QUITMAN AND PUT OURSELVES IN THEIR SHOES ABOUT WHEN THEY MAKE A REQUEST AT LEAST WE OUGHT TO RESPOND. AND THEM THAT WE GET THEIR REQUEST WERE PROCESSING AND EVEN. UNDER THEM. I PEOPLE IN OUR COMMUNITY KNOW THE STATUS OF THE EQUIPMENT THAT THEY'RE ORDERING AND THEN I HAVE A LAST QUESTION FOR THE LA- MISTER PETTIT. THE UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE SYSTEM AND- I WONDER IF YOU IT WE WE'VE CERTAINLY SEEN IN RECENT WEEKS THE SURGE IN UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE CLAIMS VERY HAPPY TO SEE THE EDT OPEN UP THAT NEW CALL CENTER THIS WEEK I THINK THAT THAT'S AT LEAST GOING TO GIVE PEOPLE. THE ABILITY TO GET THEIR CLAIMS AND THEN THERE IS THE PROCESSING- STARTED ON THEM- COULD YOU GIVE US AN UPDATE ON THE FINANCES OF THE BE ON MANAGER TRUST FUND AND WHETHER OR NOT- THAT FUND IS NOW- INSTALLED DID WITHOUT YOU KNOW WE'RE HAPPY TAKE TWELVE TITLED. SITUATION WITH A LITTLE OVER TWO TWO BILLION IN IN THE TRUST FUND RESERVE ALTHOUGH I DON'T KNOW AT THIS POINT- HAVE IT. EIGHT YEAH I DON'T KNOW AT THIS POINT IF I HAVE A THAT CURRENT FIGURE ON THAT THE BALANCE AS IT STANDS TODAY THE ADMINISTRATION MIGHT HAVE SOME INSIGHT ON THAT PERHAPS. IT IS ADDED TO MAKE THIS ONE OFTEN AGAIN WOULD DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AS THE ONLY MENTIONED WE DID HAVE- LAWS BALANCE IN THE LOW SINGLE DIGIT GOING TO DOLLARS COMING INTO. EMERGENCY HAS ALSO SEEN WITH THAT DATA IN TERMS OF THE NUMBER AT UNEMPLOYMENT PLATE. YOUR IN CALIFORNIA KNOWING. LAST PASSAGE OF IT'S ON I IN TURN OF THIS OF THE OF CLAY THAT YOU COMPARE WITH A GREAT TEN YEARS AGO OR SO WHAT THE STATE HAS DONE A TAKEN TO TAKE SOME GOING DOLLARS STAND ALONE FROM GOT JUST AS WE DID DURING THE GREAT. ALTER OVER MY COLLEAGUE WHO MAY HAVE SOME ADDITIONAL TO. THANK YOU CHRIS COOKED OF FOR AS A- APRIL. SEVENTEEN THE YOU ARE BY WAS A PROXY ONE SAID BILLION DOLLARS BUT I'LL JUST KNOW THAT. NO GIVEN THE SIR IN THE U. I. R. NUMBER OF YOU I CLICK. THE PART EDT HAS BEEN INCOME CONTACT WITH THE GOVERNMENT TO IT TO. THE MONITOR THE INCOME PLAYING. ON A OUT. ARRANGEMENTS TO DRIVE THIS FEDERAL ON I BE ALONE. IN THE PALE THE ON THE CLAIMS. THAT THEY RECEIVE. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE RICH FOLLOW UP QUESTION MISTER THIS ONE. SINCE WE ARE TAKING OUT TITLED FOR THE GOVERNMENT ARE FROM THE FEDERAL WHEN WE THAT A TWO EIGHT. THE STATE DID PAY THOSE LAW BACK AND AS A RESULT THEIR RESEARCH ARE ON EVERY EMPLOYEE IN THIS OF FOR AND YEARS ALL THE WAY TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN WHEN LOANS WERE FINALLY BACK SO THE WORD THIS TOOK OUT. BUT EMPLOYERS AND ENDED UP HAPPEN TO PICK ONE I'M ONE INTENTIONS ARE FOR THE STATE WITH RISK TO THE TITLE TWELVE LOANS TIME OTHER WORDS IT TAKE GOING TO THE- WORD. INTO NOT BACK. CHARGES BUT THE NOT EVERY EMPLOYER IN. DO I THINK ON THE WILL HAVE MORE TO SAY WITHIN A I CAN TELL YOU BRIEFLY WHERE WE ARE. AT RIGHT NOW WHICH IS THAT THE FEDERAL IN THE BILL THAT IT. I SAID THAT THEY WERE BE NO CHARGES THE STATE ON THOSE AT LEAST FOR THE END OF THIS CAN YEAR TWENTY SO ARE A TEN TO DISCUSS NOT ONLY A ANY OF BURDEN AND- MENTION. SO. QUESTION AROUND. THAT BROADER POINT ABOUT FEDERAL SUPPORT I THINK WILL BE ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT HERE BECAUSE I THINK WHAT YOU'LL SEE IS CALIFORNIA OF COURSE IS THE BIG STATE WILL BE TAKING THE LARGEST. LIKELY THAT TAKING AMONG THE LARGEST NUMBER OF LOAN AMOUNT OF LOANS FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THERE WILL BE A NUMBER OF STATES. ACROSS THE COUNTRY I CAN DISTORT. DESCRIBE WILL BE TAKING THOSE LOANS SO WHAT WE ARE HOPING FOR IS FOR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT JUST. US THIS PAST APRIL WILL TURN AS POSS. UNDER HIS THE REQUESTED. A RISK WHEN IT COMES TO. CHARGE PHONES. THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY. THAT THEY CAN SEEM ON. THE ON THIS. AND ALL JUST TURN IT ON. MICHAEL I JUST LOOK AT THE GENERAL. HE IS HELPED. STARTING PRIOR TO FUND LOAN AND FROM GENERAL THERE WERE KIND OF TWO THINGS THAT HAPPEN TO AND THE STATE AS AS AD ARCH DEPUTY MENTION THE- GEN FUND PAGE A LITTLE OVER DOLLARS IN INTEREST PAYMENTS THAT DID NOT GET.

ASSEMBLY MEMBER THIS IS MARK A MAJOR AT THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION AND I APPRECIATE- THE RESPONSE FROM MY COLLEAGUE AT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. I THINK THE APPROACH THAT WE ARE TAKING HERE IS REALLY LOOKING TO WORK WITH OUR LOCAL. WHICH THESE ASSETS. INTO I REALLY. STAND HOW WE CAN BETTER HELP AT THE INDIVIDUALS FROM MOST VULNERABLE IN THIS INSTANCE. IT'S THE INDIVIDUAL WHO IS HOMELESS AND COVERT POSITIVE. AND MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE GETTING THE SUPPORT OF CARE UNFORTUNATELY THERE IS NO TREATMENT. FOR COVERED NINETEEN YET BUT THERE ARE. THAT WE CAN. ACCESS THEM. IT'S NOT GOING TO BE THE STATE TELL. INDIVIDUAL AFTER GO IN TO OUR INTO OUR- BUT IT'S A IT'S THE PEOPLE WHO DIED IN THE- TRUST BE. SIR IS FROM THEM AT A LOT LEVEL THAT CAN AND NOT. THAT HE OR SHE IS WORKING WITH ON A BASIS AND THOSE ARE THE- THAT WE ARE. TRUSTED MESSENGERS IN THE CAN BE DURING WITH THESE POPULAR. TAYLOR RIGHT TO THEM THAT ARE YOU ARE BEING- PUT IN A HOTEL AND WHAT WRAPAROUND SERVICES WE CAN OFFER THEM. THANK YOU MISTER COOPER GONE MUST FOLLOW. I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. I THINK FIRST MY FIRST QUESTION GHOST- DEMARCO JUST UNDERSTAND- THE MODELING ME NOW MORE THAN EVER THE PUBLIC- BY THE ROUGHLY WANTS TO KNOW AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. TO UNDERSTAND YOU KNOW WHY THESE DECISIONS ARE BEING MADE BY THE GOVERNOR CAN YOU AND YOU AND I DO AGREE THAT THE MODEL IS ONLY AS GOOD AS THE ASSUMPTIONS THAT ARE PUT INTO IT SO CAN YOU. SHARE SOME OF THE SOME. MODELING THAT. SURE I AM HAPPY TO DO THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER SO- WE'VE LOOKED AT AT THIS PARTICULAR MODEL IS THE JOHNS HOPKINS MODEL I AND WE ARE LOOKING AT A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT MODELS SO THAT YOU PAY MY ONE THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT LEAVE THE UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON ANOTHER MODEL THE REASON WHY- THE U. PANAMA I THANK YOU JOHNS HOPKINS WASN'T. TO READ. IT RUN. RIGHT THERE RUNS PROBABLY AT. BILL BALLISTIC. ON A THOUSAND DIFFERENT SCENARIOS- AND SO IT GIVES YOU A RANGE IN TERMS OF WHERE YOU MIGHT BE THE OTHER REASON WE LIKE THAT JOHN TOP MODEL. THAT IT GAVE ELEVEN DATA SAID THAT WE HAD. THE RK ALI. WHAT HAPPENED. THERE ARE TWO AT AREA SO IN OF THE OF THE BASS LINE OF SOME JUST RUN THEM AT THE MEDICARE ARE NOT VALUE FOR THOSE OF YOU I'M WITH ARE NOT ARE NOT IS A VALUE THAT IS. GIVEN IN A PRETTY NEAT. AT HOW MANY THE END OF IT IT IS AND HOW MANY INDIVIDUALS MIGHT B IN FACT. GIVE YOU SOME CONTEXT AND ARE NOT VALUE OF ONE ANYTHING BELOW ONE MEANS THAT THE VIRUS WHAT KIND OF FADE OUT. ANYTHING WITHIN ONE. OVER ONE MEANS THAT AT THEIR COULD POTENTIALLY BE A PANDEMIC ARE EPIDEMIC OR AN OUTBREAK PRETEND TO MAKE IN THIS INSTANCE YOU KNOW WE'RE LOOKING AT A TWO TO THREE THIS IS IN A LOT AND WITH THE HELP IT IS A CAN. WELL CENTER CAN PREVENT. BUT WHAT. PARTICULARLY WITH THE SENATE DISEASE PREVENTION IN LOOKING AT WHAT THE UNMITIGATED ARE NOT VALUE LOOKS LIKE IN TERMS OF THE HOSPITAL. WE'RE LOOKING AT IT PERCENT STATION RATE WITHIN THIS PARTICULAR MODEL WE ARE ALSO LOOK AT A 32% CLOSE THIS OF VETERANS WERE HOT. IN THE SEE YOU SO THE ARE KIND OF UNDER S. THAT FEED INTO THIS PARTICULAR MODEL HAVE. YOU MIGHT HAVE SO ONE ONE OF. A FOLLOW UP TO THAT TO THAT IS THAT CERTAINLY THE MODELING AND THE ASSUMPTIONS ARE BASED ON THE TESTING LEVELS AND EACH EACH CAT IS HAS. A CERTAIN PROTESTING CAPACITY- CORRECT YES TO MORE THAN OTHER COUNTIES- IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY LA IN THE BAY AREA CERTAINLY OUR TESTING. DUE TO THE LA ABRASIVE EXISTED DOES THE MODELING THAT YOU CURRENTLY USED THE JOB AT. AT THE MODEL NOT A ANY THE MODELS ARE NOT BAKED IN TESTING WHAT WHAT REALLY- THE ACTUAL DATA THAT WE'RE GETTING CERTAINLY IS BASED ON TESTING BECAUSE THAT SOMEBODY HAS TO BE TASK IN ORDER TO CONFIRM POSITIVE BUT THE ACTION THAT WERE THAT FUNCTION OF TESTING TO SOME EXTENT- BUT THE ACTUAL MY OF DATA THAT'S COMING OUT OF THE MODEL. NOT ADJUSTED TO THE TIME. SO THEN IN OF THE INTERACTIONS BETWEEN THE DATA AND THAT AND THAT AND THE MODELING EVEN A QUE THEY CLEARLY WERE MAKING DECISIONS ON REAL TIME DATA SO HOSPITALS UP AS AT LEAST THE ONES THAT I'M FAMILIAR WITH AND KERN COUNTY THAT THEIR- THEY- SO HOW. YOU ADJUSTING THEN FOR A HOW DO YOU AND HOW ARE YOU FACTORING IN THOSE TYPES OF- DATA. TO IS TO ALLOW. THE DOUBLE HOSPITALS TO RE OPEN AND A LOT AND DO DO SURGERIES ARE YOU IS THAT PART OF THE GEN IN TERMS OF WELL AS WE JUST MOVING. YEAH THAT'S QUESTION DOWN A TREE JOB INCLUDING THE IN YOUR DE I'VE BEEN IN INCREDIBLE JOB OF DOING TWO THINGS ONE THEY HAVE DEPRESSED MEANING THAT THEY'VE MOVED LEVEL JOBS DON'T NEED AT A KEY LEVEL CARE HOSPITAL LEVEL CARE TO OTHER STRINGS- AND THEN MORE IMPORTANTLY THEY'VE ALSO BUILT UP A SURGE CAPACITY AND SO THEY ARE PREPARED IT. CAN HAVE OVERNIGHT. OUR I SEE YOU BACK RATE RK STRAIGHT OUT THAT WILL HELP IN THINKING REGARDS TO THE INDICATORS THAT THE GOVERNOR OUTLINED OUT WE CAN BE ABLE ARE RIGHT THE DISH INFORMATION ON THIS WE- I AROUND HOW DO WE- HAVE. TO CERTAIN THINGS IN ORDER TO MAKE MY- SUCH AS ARE CERTAIN REASON PARTICULAR HOSPITAL'S ASSET THAT WILL BE PART OF THAT EQUATION THAT REAL DATA REALLY HELPS US THINK ABOUT WHAT DO WE DO MOVING FORWARD AND THE SURGEON ONE OF THOSE ASKED. SO I GUESS THE FOLLOW UP ON THAT IS THERE JUST. ALLOW FOR LACK OF BETTER TERM NON HOT SPOT COUNTIES THE ABILITY TO FACE AND BACK TO WORK TO ALLOW HOSPITALS TO REESTABLISH- THE SELECTED PROCEDURES TO ALLOW PHYSICIANS TO SEE PATIENTS TWO SIX CLEARLY WITH THE SAME. CRITERIA ESTABLISHED BODY IS THAT A POSSIBILITY. SO THAT'S PART OF THE EQUATION AND THAT'S PART OF OUR THINKING IN REGARDS TO THE SIX INDICATORS- I'VE BEEN GOVERNOR ALTERNATELY WILL BE ADVISED BY HIS PUBLIC HEALTH AND SCIENCE ADVISERS AROUND- YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE SEEING WITH GUARDS DATA AND THEN HOW. TO MODIFY THOSE AT. HIGHS ARE INTERNET THAT WE CAN PLACE THAT CERTAINLY COULD BE AT STATE AID OR IT COULD BE YOU KNOW BUT WE HAVE TO BE VERY THOUGHT. IS WHAT WE DON'T WANT. WHAT COMING IN CAREER. PAN OR WHAT HAVE. NINETEEN SIXTEEN PANDEMIC WITH REGARDS TO THE CITY STAFF OR ACT AREAS THAT TOOK ASKED WE ACTION TO REACH AND WE NEED TO BE VERY VERY THOUGHTFUL ABOUT HOW WE DO THAT TOO. BUT THAT BY. I WILL BE OUT SET IT. AFTER THE INTERVENTIONS LEFT IN. OKAY AND IN ERMS OF THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- FOR THE PUBLIC HOSPITALS MUCH OF THE SUB TO FUNDING- IS PART OF THE CURRENT ELEVEN FIFTEEN WAIVER WHAT IS THE CURRENT STATUS AN EXTENSION AND I THINK THAT. THE IT ON A PER REPORTING BASIS JUST BECAUSE AND NOW EVERYTHING IS AS COVERT FOCUSED. ASSEMBLYMEMBER ALTERNATE OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE ADAM DORSEY TO ANSWER THAT. HI MY- COMPUTER IS FREEZING UP A LITTLE BIT OF SEEMING EVERYONE CAN HEAR ME- SO YES WE HAVE A NUMBER OF WAIVER REQUEST- PENDING FEDERAL GOVERNMENT NOW I'M SURE A LOT OF THOSE WERE WERE WERE WAITING STILL- FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT YOU KNOW YOU'RE BACK ON OF. I DON'T ANYTHING ELSE FOR. THIS STAGE I'M BUT DEPARTMENT HEALTHCARE SERVICES HAS BEEN. RELEASING YOU KNOW INFORMATION PUBLICLY AT SOME OF THOSE THINGS THAT BECOME APPROVED- THE SHOW- WILL WILL PROVIDE MORE UPDATES ON THAT IS THAT COM- BUT WITH RESPECT TO FUTURE- YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK SO. WITH THE GOVERNMENT I THINK RIGHT NOW WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS WE'RE TRYING TO CLOSE. HOW THE ROLL OUT OF THE FEDERAL ASSISTANCE. HAPPENED AND WE KNOW THAT THERE'S A LOT OF FEDERAL MONEY THERE THE FIRST. GEN PROVIDER REALLY AND WE THINK THAT'S BEEN HOW YOU KNOW THE MORE I TO BE DONE AND THEN THIRD THING I WOULD SAY IS THAT WE CONTINUE TO WORK ON FEDERAL ASK ON NEW FOR THAT PLACE AND SPORTS AND WORKING FEDERAL PARTNERS- TO MAKE SURE. THAT FOR ASSISTANCE- IS KIND AND IS THERE TO HELP SUPPORT THE PROVIDER COMMUNITY. SO TO FOLLOW UP ON THAT CERTAINLY THERE YOU'VE EVEN A KID THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL STRESS ON AND OFF DOCTORS RIGHT NOW WE HAVE POSITION. STEMS THAT MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SURVIVE- THE DEPEND MAKE JUST BECAUSE PATIENTS AREN'T ARE GOING. DID THE REGULAR CHECK UPS INTO GETTING SERVICES. THE FEAR THAT THERE'S A SECOND SURGE OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM BUT CERTAINLY NON COVALENT MEDICAL NEEDS- OF. THOUGH YOU KNOW THAT THE INCREASE IN AND OTHER- OTHER THAT. INCREASE OTHER TREATMENT DISEASE IS AN AND OTHER FACTORS IT WHAT IS THE ADMINISTRATION'S PLAN TO ADDRESS THAT. YEAH SO- MAYBE I'LL START AND THEN- I CAN KICK IT OFF TO. THE AGENCY HAS ANYTHING ELSE TO ADD ON THIS BUT- YOU'RE RIGHT OUT THIS IS HAPPENING THIS IS SOMETHING THAT YOU KNOW WE'RE HEARING FROM THE PROVIDER COMMUNITY- IT'S A- IT'S A STRESS FOR INDIVIDUALS- WHO ARE DELAYING CARE IT'S A STRESS. THE HEALTH- FROM THE FINANCE ACTIVE- AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT WERE YOU KNOW LOOKING AT MODELING AND TRYING TO THINK ABOUT- AND FACTORING INTO A KIND OF THE ASSISTANCE THAT WE'RE TRYING TO PURSUE- SO. WE'RE OUR- THERE WILL BE SOME. SORT OF SMART BACK OF A THIRD SERVICES WILL LIKELY OCCUR BUT WE DON'T KNOW TO WHAT EXTENT AND WE'RE WE'RE TRYING TO SORT OF PLAN FOR THAT AND MODEL FOR THAT AS BEST WE CAN- THINKING BEING COMING MONSOON YOUR AND MARK. FROM HEALTH. AGENCY YOU GOT IT. I AM ASSEMBLY MEMBER FONG THANK YOU FOR QUESTION AND ADAM AT YOU TO A REALLY NAY JOB CAPTURING AND I THINK THE THINGS THAT I WILL ADD IS I THINK WE'RE BEING PROACTIVE A STUNNED THE MEDIC SIDE TO REALLY THINK ABOUT WHAT. WE CAN PROVIDE FOR THEM TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE CARE. AS ADAM MENTIONED YOU DO HAVE A SERIES OF WAIVERS THAT ARE PENDING BEFORE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. PRESS FISHEL FLEXIBILITY WE RECOGNIZE THAT THIS IS AN UNBELIEVABLY DIFFICULT TIME FOR THEM TO. ESPECIALLY SOME OF THE SMALLER PRACTICES- WHERE THEY'RE NOT. SEEING THE VOLUME. AT COMING THROUGH THE DOOR. SO THAT IS. FROM AT LEAST THE MEDICAID SIDE AND THAT'S AN ACTIVE CONVERSATION THAT WE'RE HAVING WITH THE CENTERS FROM MEDICARE AND MEDICAID SERVICES AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL I APPRECIATE THAT. TO HAVE TO THAT TOO CALLOW YES IN TERMS OF THE PPO DISCUSSION- I WANT TO I WANT TO PIGGYBACK OFF WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER OBERNOLTE HAD INDICATED THAT WHICH SEEMS AT IN CONVERSATIONS WITH MY COLLEAGUES AND WITHIN MY PUBLIC HEALTH DIRECTOR.

THERE IS A SHIPMENT BEING A PP BEING SET THAT IF IT'S 50% ORDER OF ITS TAX AND THE ORDER OF ITS 95% THE ORDER THAT THAT CAN BE. THAT CAN BE TOLD IN ADVANCE TO A PUBLIC HEALTH DIRECTORS SO THEY DIDN'T TO EXPOSE. THANKS FOR THE QUESTION SO MEMBER I AM I WOULD JUST TELL YOU THAT- YOU KNOW WE CAN CONTINUE TO ENSURE THAT THAT OCCURS- THERE IS THERE IS A LOT OF COORDINATION AND COMMUNICATION IT'S GOING ON BETWEEN. THE MYSTICS DISTRIBUTION LIST AND THE RECEIVING A REQUEST. BUT I'LL YOU THAT- THAT YOU KNOW WILL ENSURE THAT IT IF THAT CONTINUES. IT CONTINUES TO BE. AN ISSUE THAT THAT THAT WILL CONTINUE. KEY YOU SHARE SOME OF THE CRITERIA BEING YOU. TERMINATING HOW MUCH IS PROVIDED SO WELL IF. YES IT OUT THERE YES IT. 10% FULHAM BUT WHAT GOES INTO THAT GEN.

THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBER RANDALL I KNOW YOU COVERED A LOT OF GROUND AT FIRST ON THE QUESTION AND I THINK I WILL IT OVER FIRST TO ACT WORSE FOR OUR AGE YOU AND THEN MARK MAGICJACK H. H.

THOSE INTO IN WE KNOW THAT SKILL NURSING IF TAKE. HAS SO SOME REALLY YOU GALA WITH HER EX. JUST AT AND. JUST ACCORDING. THIS STILL IS. OPTIONS GOING FORWARD AS WELL- AND THE SECOND THING THAT I'LL TOUCH ON WITH RESPECT TO CONNECTING WORKERS THE ADMINISTRATION- IS ENGAGE IN A HEALTH CORD THAT IS TRYING TO CONNECT WORKERS TO WHERE THEY ARE NEEDED. AND NO UTILIZED PEOPLE WHERE THEY'VE GOT YOU KNOW THEY'RE KIND OF PROFESSIONAL SKILLS THAT THEY CAN BROUGHT TO BEAR THIS AND I KNOW THAT THERE'S A NUMBER OF OTHER THINGS THAT- THE AGENCY WILL BE ABLE TO ADD. ONS ALL HIT NUMBER MARK OR. I GOT READY THIS IS A FROM ME WITH THE HELPING YOU SERVICES AGE. FOR AT REALLY THANK YOU THAT. BE THE INDIVIDUALS IN THE GOVERNOR THINK. ARE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE MOST VULNERABLE- AND SO THERE- WE'VE TAKEN. CON ACTIONS- OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS. ADD TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE SUPPORTING US FACILITIES SO LET ME START BY.

LIKE THEY- APPRECIATE THE PRAISE THAT THEY RECEIVE BUT REALLY NEED HELP DURING THIS CRISIS AND OFTEN TIMES THAT IN TERMS OF. BOTH BETTER SUPPORT- FINANCIALLY AS WELL AS MORE BODIES SO THE STIPEND IS A WONDERFUL WOULD WANTS TO JUST CONTINUE TO WORK AND TALK WITH THE ADMINISTRATOR IN REGARDING OFF LEASE FOR HAZARD PAY. IT'S HARD WHEN YOU'RE GETTING PAID MINIMUM WAGE AND BEING ASKED TO DO THE WORK THAT IS REQUIRED AT A SKILLED NURSING FACILITY NOT. THE END. IS A NOTHER MINIMUM WAGE JOB AND SO I BELIEVE WE CAN DO SOMETHING AS A STATE TO INCENTIVIZE. WHAT IS NOT MINIMUM WAGE EMPLOYMENT BUT TRULY A VITAL AND QUIRK SERVICE. WITH THAT WILL MOVE ASKING RE BEHAVE HEALTH I WANTEDTO MAKE SURE THAT WE WERE. DOING EVERYTHING THAT WE COULD AS AN ADMINISTRATION TO AND HER ACCESS TO BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES DURING THIS PANDEMIC WANTED TO ASK ARE WE LOOKING TOWARDS EXPANSION TO. BEHAVIORAL HEALTH TELEHEALTH. HOW CAN WE SUPPORT WHAT IS AN ALREADY.

I'M- ALL WE ARE HEARING WHAT YOU WERE HEARING FROM THE PROVIDER INUNDATED BUT THERE WAS A SUBSTANTIAL DROP IN IN HEALTH TREATMENT THAT WAS HAPPENING- FOR THOSE PRACTICES I. AND WE THINK IT IS IMPORTANT TO TRY TO SUPPORT UTILIZATION OF THOSE SERVICES PARTICULARLY DURING THIS TIME- YOU KNOW IT ALSO JUST SORT OF REFERENCES IS YOU KNOW SOME OF THE HOUSING SUPPORTS THEM- THAT WERE ALSO. DOING THAT. WE THINK WILL BE SUPPORTIVE OF THE OF THE INDIVIDUALS WHO- MAY BE EXPERIENCING BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CHALLENGES WELL AS- YOU KNOW HOUSING INSTABILITY- AND SO YEAH I WAS SOME OF THESE THINGS ARE ARE ACTUALLY BEING SHOOT AT THE MOMENT. AND WE WILL. ASK YOU FOR TO YOU MARKHAM EACH AT THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY SOME OF THE OTHER ISSUES ALL. DOCTOR THANK YOU FOR THAT.

JOINT AROUND AND MENTAL HEALTH BE ABLE HEALTH TOOL KIT- AND SO THAT IS AVAILABLE WE ARE ALSO AT AND BEING UP OUR OUTLINES FERRIES MENTAL HEALTH IN APRIL HEALTH HOT LINES IN THOSE ARE AVAILABLE. T. B. A. WE'VE GOT A SEE THE RESPONSES FOR END OF THERE ADD TO SUPPORT THEM THAT OBVIOUSLY OR WORK THAT SHOULD NOT ADD UP TO THE MEDICAID TO SUPPORT. BETTER IS THERE'S SO WE WILL LEAVE ONE OF THE THINGS YOU'VE DONE ADMINISTRATIVE HE IS YOU. OUR REGION TELL. SAME LEVEL. AS IN PERSON VISIT WOULD JUST ENCOURAGE THE MINISTER CHEN TO CONTINUE THIS PRACTICE. AND I GUESS I IN OF HAD BEEN TAPED FOR TO LOOK TOWARDS THIS TECHNOLOGY IS A RESOURCE. BUT I WOULD TO TELL YOU. RIGHT WAS YESTERDAY SOMETIMES I THINK WE HAVE TO. BE HUMAN AND HAVE STORIES AS WELL I WAS IN SOME PLACE WHERE I'VE PRACTICED MEDICINE FOR TEN YEARS AT A FOOD DISTRIBUTION YESTERDAY WITH THE- ROBBIE SEEK CHURCH THAT WAS DISTRIBUTING SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND POUNDS WORTH OF. GOODS TO A COMMUNITY THAT I KNEW WELL AND THEY HAD HUNDREDS IF NOT MORE THAN A THOUSAND CARS LINED UP TO RECEIVE GOOD SEE. IT IS A ROOM FOR ME AND A GOOD PRACTICE FOR MANY OF US WITHIN PUBLIC SERVICE TO REMEMBER THE NEED OF COMMUNITY RIGHT NOW. AND SO I WANT TO TALK IF I COULD HAVE BROUGHT THIS UP. FOR BUT TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR FOOD YOUR SUPPORT. NOW I UNDERSTAND THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS HAVING. RELIEF COMING IN JUNE OR JULY AND THAT INITIAL APPROPRIATION FOR EMERGENCY RELIEF ALLOWED US TO GET SOME FOOD OUT THE DOOR NOW. ARE WE AT FULL POWER THE FOR OUR FOOD THANKS FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL MONTHS AND HOW CAN WE ENSURE SINCE WE KNOW THERE'S GOING TO BE A GREAT NEED. THAT THEY HAD. REAL FRIENDS NOW WE NOR GET TWELVE GRID PEOPLE WHO APPLY FOR CAL FRESH IN A MONTH AND LAST MONTH IT WAS SHORTENED BECAUSE OF THE STAY AT HOME TIMELINE. WE HAD TWENTY SEVEN HUNDRED PEOPLE WHO APPLIED FOR CALIBRATION. SO I KNOW THAT. FOR OUR BANK SOMEONE JUST ASKED THE ADMINISTRATION TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE FULLY FUNDED AT CAPACITY AT ABLE TO DISTRIBUTE GOODS AT THIS TIME. HOPING THE ADMINISTRATION CAN COMMENT ON THAT QUESTION. YES I THINK I WILL TURN IT OVER FIRST TO MARCO YOU CAN TALK SPECIFICALLY ABOUT THE V. G. ISSUE RECOMMEND ANY OTHER CONCERNS ADDRESSED. DOCTOR ARAMBULA THANK YOU AGAIN AND I THINK. IN TERMS OF YOUR FIRST AT PEACE AROUND FOOD BANKS AS WE LOOTED TO EARLIER THIS WAS AN INTENT MASTER. IN AND MAKE SURE THEY DID NOT. HAVE A BIG GAPS AS WE WAIT FOR ADDITIONAL FEDERAL FUNDING ON THE EBT OR ARE AT MY APOLOGIES CALTRAIN SNAP SIDE CONFERENCE SHE AS I THE CALIFORNIA IS NOW GRANT. YOU HAVE ALREADY HE- IS. WHAT MEANS TO ONE POINT THREE MILLION HOUSE OUT WE ALSO HAVE A PEN EACH WAIVER ASKED SUBMIT IT TO THE PROGRAM IN THE U. S. T. IN PARTICULAR AND WHAT I WOULD DO IS IT WOULD ALLOW US. OUR FOOD IS. WHAT GETTING NORMAL THERE'S SO WHY HOPING TO GET APPROVAL THAT AND ORDER ADDITIONALLY WE WORK WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO ALLOW OUR CALVET EXTRA HANDS TO USE THEIR EBT CARDS ON LINE AND WE DID RECEIVE APPROVAL APPROVAL FOR AND WE WILL BE DOING. SELECT GROUP. HE SAID THAT. YES SIR WE HAVE TO THE BUT THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO GET THERE ONLINE I'M WE KNOW THEIR IS BIG YOU NEED AFTER FOOD AND WE'RE WHAT. AFTER THE VARIOUS FOOD. PROGRAM WE- IN ADDITION TO OUR PARTNERSHIPS I WITH THE FOOD BANKS AS YOU PROBABLY KNOW BUT BANKS ARE ALSO HAVING A HARD TIME RECRUITING VOLUNTEERS. ARE AT OUR- THE NATIONAL GUARD WAS TREMENDOUS AND HELPING AND SO IS THERE. ARE ACT CAL BALLING TEARS WE ARE SERVICE FARMER BE ADMINISTRATION TO REAL. I'VE BEEN ABLE TO PROVIDE THE- PACK. ACTION DELIVERING FOR FOLKS SO I THIS IS A AS AT THAT DIRECTOR GO DUE TO SAYS ONE ONE WHERE TRYING TO DO ALL OF OUR RE. ACROSS THE VARIOUS ENERGY PROGRAMS MAY WE'RE MEETING THE MANTIS CAN I AND WE READ WE'RE WORKING ON LEVERAGES TOOLS AND- THAT'S BETTER RESOURCE. FIRST TO BE A- THE MOST. THERE'S A QUOTE AND I DON'T WANT TO TRIED FROM ARE CHAVEZ ABOUT AN IRONY ABOUT. ANOTHER PEOPLE'S FOOD TO. BUT I BRING IT UP BECAUSE IT FEELS PARTICULARLY UNFAIR AS ARE UNDOCUMENTED COMMUNITY WAS EXCLUDED FROM THE FEDERAL STIMULUS AND SO MY NEXT QUESTIONS ARE REGARDING THE LEADERSHIP THAT THE STATE IS TAKING AND PROVIDE IT IN SEAVER. TO OUR COMMUNITY. THIS IS A PPO. CAN COLLECT INFORMATION AS THEY DISTRIBUTE THE SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN INCOME SUPPORT HAT CAN HELP US TO INFORM WHAT ARE UNMET NEEDS FUTURE EFFORTS THAT WE CAN PROVIDE TO RELIEVE OR OUR DISPATCH. THAT WOULD HELP US IN- THE FUTURE DECISIONS. YEAH COLLECTION. I CAN FOLLOW UP OFFLINE IF THE QUESTION IS STUMPING HOUSE WHAT I REALLY AM TRYING TO. UNDER UP CAN YOU HEAR ME SORRY WE HAVE TO TECHNOLOGY ISSUES THERE WE GO ALL RIGHT YES OKAY GREAT- SO AS YOU FOR THAT QUESTION HE ARE WORKING THAT LEAD TO THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES I THERE IS TO MAKE GROUPS. WE WERE ON A ON A- IS TO ASSESS NEED A THE LOCAL LEVEL CERTAINLY HAPPY FOLLOW WITH YOU AND YOUR TEAM I WOULD NOTE THAT THE GOVERNOR AND I DID STEP UP IN THIS YEAH WHERE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT I WAS NOT ABLE TO PROVIDE RESOURCES TO OUR I'M DR ED. RIGHT THINK BEFORE. WHERE PROVIDE ASSIST TO THEM SO I WOULD YOU KNOW THE ADMINISTRATION IS ATTEMPTING TO STEP IN AND MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE REALLY CALIFORNIA FOR ALL AS THE GOVERNOR OF THIS IS OUR OUR OUR OUR VALUES AND WE'RE STEPPING OUT THERE WE WILL BE HAPPY FOLLOW UP WITH YOU ON THE TEKHELET PONENS. SO I'M AS WE MIGHT BE LOOKING- FOR. WHEN I WOULD HAVE PAID THAT FOLLOW LINE. AND THEN I WILL FINAL QUESTION IF I MAY AND THAT'S- IN TERMS OF SAFEGUARDING OUR IN HOME SUPPORTIVE SERVICES AS WELL AS OUR ADULT PROTECTIVE SERVICES. I WANT TO SEE IF YOU CAN SPEAK FIRST TO. HOW THE CASELOADS HAVE CHANGED IN BOTH THE HSS AS WELL AS APS. AND HAS CHANGED DURING THE BASIS. AND DO WE HAVE ANY PROBLEM THANKS FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL MONTHS LOOKING AT THESE TWO POPULATIONS. AND WHAT IS THE STATE OF. PROVISIONS FOR OUR AYE HSS AND APS WORKERS AND THEN FINALLY IS THERE A DIFFERENCE AMONGST CERTAIN COUNTIES AND WHY I'M TRYING TO GO THERE IS TO ENSURE THAT ALL OF OUR CONTRACT EMPLOYEES. RECEIVED AN APPROPRIATE ACTIONS AND THAT ALL COUNTIES ARE DOING THE SAME. THIS IS MARK A MAJOR AGAIN WITH THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCIES SO WE ARE UNBELIEVABLY GRATEFUL TO AYE HSS PROVIDERS WHO ARE STEPPING UP AT THIS VERY DIFFICULT TIME- AS PART OF THE INITIAL ROUND OF FUNDING THERE IS A SECTION THIRTY SIX LETTER WHERE WE REQUEST FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. CHECK IN- FOR. CONSUME WITH THE WRITERS AND THAT WAS MATCHED BY WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WE ARE ALSO SETTING ASIDE PP FOR PROVIDER SPECIFICALLY- WHO ARE DEALING WITH INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE COVERED NINETEEN POSITIVE OR SUSPECT SO WE ARE WORKING WITH OUR COUNTY PARTNERS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE. REACHING OUT THAT AFTER AT THAT PP OUR TO THE AND SO THAT WORKING TEAM DOESN'T THEM AND I KNOW THAT OUR DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES WORKING CLOSELY WITH OUR LABOR. I TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE PROVIDING REAL TIME INFORMATION I TO THE- WORKERS WHO ARE DOING A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF WORK. AND IT'S A DIFFICULT TIME AND WE'RE LOOKING TO STEP TO PROVIDE AS MUCH SUPPORT AS WE POSSIBLY CAN. WELL I. AM HAVE HEARD ANECDOTAL THAT APS REPORTS ARE DOWN BUT WOULD ACTUALLY WANTS TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS VULNERABLE POPULATION AT THE MOMENT- WAS SUPPORTED AND- WE HAVE LOOKED TOWARDS HELPING THIS POPULATION WITH A HOME SAFE PROPOSAL AS WELL AS A SUPPORTING COUNTY YES WORKERS AND- THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL. CRISIS FINE IF I AND JUST TO HIS OWN. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US. BOTH BILL I'VE SPOKEN. TO THE CHAIR AND ABOUT KEEPING AN EYE TOWARDS RECOVERING AND REBUILDING AND WOULD BE FEARFUL THAT WE ARE BEING UNFAIR TO OUR PROVIDER COMMUNITY AT A MOMENT WHEN IT IS THEIR PRACTICES ARE DRASTICALLY CHANGED. THAT WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO PROVIDE SUPPORT WAY THAT INSURANCE THEY CONTINUED TO BE AROUND TO PROVIDE THAT SUPPORT. SO WHILE WE LOOK AT THE FINANCE THIS OF THIS I WOULD JUST ENCOURAGE THE STATE TO GO IN THAT DIRECTION AND I DON'T. MIND BEING TRANSPARENT ABOUT THAT I AUTHORED A BILL IF YOU YEARS AGO CODIFYING INFORMATION DONE THROUGH THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT BY PRESIDENT OBAMA. REGARD MEDICAL LOSS RATIO AND WHAT ENCOURAGE US AS A BODY TO LOOK TOWARDS OUR HEALTH INSURANCE PLANS THAT HAVE A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF RESOURCES THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE PROVIDING TOWARDS MEDICAL CARE I HAVE CONCERNS AS WE ARE LOOKING TOWARDS OUR INSURANCE. THAT THEY CAN BE A PART OF THE SOLUTION TO ENSURE WE HAVE THE RESOURCES NECESSARY TO ADDRESS THIS CRISIS HEAD ON. WANT THE ADMINISTRATION TO HOPEFULLY ENGAGE IN THOSE CONVERSATIONS AND WORK WITH US AS A LEGISLATIVE BRANCH TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR DOLLARS THAT WE PAID FOR PREMIUMS ARE ACTUALLY GOING TO PROVIDE CARE. SO RIGHT NOW WOULD. TURN MY TIME BACK OVER TO YOU MISTER CHAIR I WOULD ENCOURAGE OUR STATE TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE LEADERSHIP DURING THIS CRISIS AS WE CAN PROTECT OUR COMMUNITIES AND OUR CONSTITUENTS. CREEK DR ED WHAT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I'D LIKE TO THANK THE CHAIR AND THE SPEAKER FOR THE OPPORTUNITY- TO ACTUALLY BE HERE TODAY THIS IS NOT A COMMITTEE THAT I SAID ON. BUT THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR SOME QUICK. BUT I'VE BEEN REALLY WANTING TO ASK FOR QUITE A WHILE. I ASK THESE QUESTIONS IN THE SPIRIT OF- ACTUALLY LOOKING AT SECTION THIRTY SEVEN OF SB EIGHTY NINE. WHERE IT SAYS ONCE AGAIN AS AS- ONE MAKE SURE THERE'S A BIPARTISAN CONCERN- MISTER OBERNOLTE READ THIS SUMMER. THE FIRST LINE AGAIN BECAUSE I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT. WE HE- BY THIS AS A NAME. THE WAY I WANT TO DISCUSS THINGS HERE TODAY. THE END OF THE LEGISLATURE IT MINUTES. TO WORK STAKEHOLDERS ANG TEAM MEMBERS I JUST. PLEDGES STAFF. IT'S CLEAR THAT MR WORKING WITH. THEIRS BUT NOT PLEDGES SURE. THE STAFF. I HAVE A HEALTH COMMITTEE STAFF HAS OVER A HUNDRED OF HEALTH POLICY X. AND WE HAVE NOT BEEN ENGAGED AND WE HAVE BEEN TRYING TO ENGAGE. I WANT TO COMPLIMENT THE GOVERNOR I THINK IT'S AN AMAZING- AND I'M PROUD CALIFORNIAN AND WITH THE LEADER THAT THE GOVERNOR SHOWN. IT'S BEEN AUTUMN. WE COULD GET TO AN NOVEL. THERE IS TREMENDOUS EXPERTISE IN THIS LEGISLATIVE BODY. TO BE ABLE TO HELP TAKE THINGS TO A LEVEL AND IT FEELS LIKE EVERY FOR I MAY TO. GET THAT TO ANOTHER LEVEL- I'VE- SINCE QUITE FRANKLY- AND SO. GETTING INFORMATION THAT MIGHT DID YOU ONCE HE DESPERATELY NEED BEEN DIFFICULT. IT'S A MYTH OPPORTUNITY IT'S A MISSED OPPORTUNITY BECAUSE EACH OF US ON THE DíAS REPRESENT FOUR HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE. WE HAVE RELATIONSHIPS WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS- CITIES COUNTIES- SPECIAL DISTRICTS ARE HOSPITALS ARE DOCTOR GROUPS A VARIETY OF THINGS. WE'RE NOT GETTING- INFORMATION THAT WE THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO US TO BE ABLE TO COMMUNICATE PEOPLE AND TAKE THINGS TO THE NEXT LEVEL SO I SAY THESE THINGS IN THIS OF- WE GO FORWARD- AND HOW DO WE- GET THE YOU KNOW GET TE OPTION TO BE ENGAGED- MORE. AND ACTUALLY HELP SOLVE THESE SOME OF THESE LUNCHES- I HAVE SOME SPECIFIC QUESTIONS BUT THAT'S FRAME WHICH I TRY TO BE. CORD HOW DO WE- LIVE UP TO- THE INTENT IN SB EIGHTY NINE AND- ENGAGE LEGISLATURE ENGAGE LEGISLATIVE STATE STAFF. WE OFTEN AS LEGISLATORS- HERE MAYBE FIVE MINUTES BEFORE AN EXECUTIVE ORDER COMES OUT. OR OR WATCHING THE GOVERNOR. DALY AIDS TO GET INFORMATION YEAH- THAT'S THE CHAPLAINS MIGHT. WHEN I MY DISTRICT I HAVE COUNTY PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICERS IN HOSPITAL EXECUTIVES MEMBERS THE KINI. INFORMATION I TO SAY. NO I'LL TRY TO GET BACK TO YOU AND THAT'S- I THINK THAT'S A MISSED OPPORTUNITY- AS FAR AS QUICK IN SOME SPECIFIC QUESTIONS HERE. WE HAD AN EVENT HAPPENED- OVER THE WEEKEND TO- WHERE- A AN INMATE FROM CDC ARE FROM CHINO WAS RELEASED- WAS SUPPOSED TO GO TO STANISLAUS COUNTY- AND SO AND SELF QUARANTINE THERE FOR TWO WEEKS- THAT RELEASED. THE INMATE UP IN MENDOCINO COUNTY ARE WHERE. WE HAVE WE HAVE CASES IN MENDOCINO COUNTY- THE LAST ONE WAS A TWENTY TWO OR TWENTY THREE DAYS AGO NOW. AND NOW WE HAVE SOMEONE WHO EXPOSED TO ENDED UP IN OUR COUNTY NO NO THIS. AN THE IS A CONCERN TO ME SO MY QUESTION MY FIRST QUESTION IS. AS WERE READ SEEN IN MAYES FROM STATE PRISONS ARE WE TESTING. OR WE AND ARE WE FOLLOWING UP TO SEE THAT THEY ACTUALLY ARE SELF QUARANTINE SO THAT WE DON'T END UP WITH ANOTHER SITUATION WHERE AN INMATE- FORMER INMATE- ENDS UP IN A COUNTY THAT LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ISN'T EXPECTING. PUBLIC HEALTH IS AN EX. AND HOW DO WE YOU KNOW HOW DO WE GET THAT INFORMATION OUT THERE- SO THE QUESTION IS ARE THEY BEING TESTED PRIOR TO. PRIOR TO RELEASE AND IF NOT HOW WE ENSURING THAT THEY ARE ACTUALLY QUARANTINING IN PLACE WHERE THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO. THIS IS IN THE REST OF THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND WE ARE AWARE OF THOSE SITUATIONS- AND THE INCIDENT THAT TOOK PLACE MENDOCINO. AND UNDERSTAND THAT THE INDIVIDUAL WAS REMOVED AND- THERE ARE CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE- THAT HAD TO. BE IN THE OUT BECAUSE IT IS A PLACE THAT WOULD PLACE THEM. THE THAT WHAT. I'M IN A SENSE THAT OR REST. CATEGORY SO I'M I'M NOT A COULD NOT SAYING THAT THAT WAS RIGHT I THINK THAT WE ARE I'M- JEFF AWARE THAT YOU CAN. WE ARE NOT TESTING. AND WE ARE. CONTROL EXPOSURE IT HAS I'M I'M LEAVING IS FEES OF AT THIS I. IN THE GORE WORKING ON ADDITIONAL PARTNERSHIPS WITH CHEAP ARCHIE PROBATION OFFICERS OF CALIFORNIANS CDC ART- IDENTIFY MORE AND PLACEMENTS EITHER THROUGH PROJECT DRINKING OR OTHER AND HOUSING OPTIONS I THINK WE'RE STILL WORKING THROUGH A LOT OF THOSE ISSUES WITH PREMATURE TO GIVE YOU MORE. THAN POINT BUT WE ARE AWARE AND WORKING TO THE ISSUE CAN THIS MONTH WEREN'T THE RELEASE OF ABOUT THOUSAND OFFENDERS AND IT WOULD BE OUR TO OUR TEST EACH ONE OF THEM AND AS THEIR LEADING BUT ONLY. TO BE TEAM HAS A POTENTIAL. HAVE I DO. IS THE INDICATION WITH OUR COUNTY PART COULD BE I THINK IN REALLY WE STAR COMMUNICATING FROM C. ARE WITH COUNTY PROP PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT BUT NOT NECESSARILY PROBATION WHICH WE RECOGNIZE AS OF. ACTIVE AND MAKING SURE THAT WE EIGHT SEVEN INDIVIDUALS EARLY AND SO THAT THEY CAN ENGAGED HER PROBATION OFFICER LOCALLY LOCALLY AS WELL. WELL I THINK THE CONCERN IS THAT- YOU DO YOU DO YOU HAVE SOMEONE WHO IS NOW IN A COMMUNITY. THAT WAS CLOSED- IN A SETTING AND THE COMMUNITY DIDN'T KNOW THE PERSON WAS COMING IN AND THAT COULD HAVE BEEN. SO WE DON'T KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE AT THIS POINT I'M SURE OUR PUBLIC HEALTH AUTHORITIES IN MENDOCINO COUNTY OR TRYING TO TRACE UP WE DON'T KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE THAT THAT PERSON CAME IN CONTACT WITH. WE DON'T KNOW. NOW I'M NOT EVEN SURE IF THAT. HAS JUST POSITIVE BUT IT I HOPE THIS. BEEN OTHER OTHER NEEDS I'M JUST. FIVE I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THAT AND I KNOW MY- MY SHARE OF FROM MY DISTRICT ATTORNEY AND- MY COUNTIES. YEAH AND A HUGE RIGHT OF OTHER PEOPLE ARE. SCRATCHING OUR HEADS ON THAT I'VE ASKED TO A VAST MODELING DATA AS- AS AS OTHERS HAVE PASSED AND- AN APPRECIATE THE CHARTS THAT WE SAW I DO NOTE THAT- THERE'S A THEIR- IT DOESN'T. COMPLY HE LINES ON THE BOTTOM THAT SHOW THE DAY AND SHE THE IN THE NUMBER OF CASES. IF YOU LOOK AT THE DATES- AND THE RED LINES IT SHOWS ABOUT THE FIRST THIRD OF APRIL YET WE ARE IN THE- THIRD THROUGHOUT APRIL AND- I'M- I'M- AS A DATA DATA IS SENT IS NOT CURRENT SO WE DON'T REALLY KNOW. LAST WHERE. ARE SO. I RECOGNIZE THAT THERE'S ALL THAT BUT AS SOMEONE WITH A SCIENCE BACKGROUND AS SOME OF THE HEALTH CARE BACKGROUND AS DOES OUR DOCTOR ARAMBULA- I THINK WE ARE PROBABLY UNIQUELY POSITIONED TO UNDERSTAND THE DATA AND UNDERSTAND THE IMPLICATIONS OF THE DATA BUT WE HAVE BEEN GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO LOOK AT- AND- MORE TO CALL FOR ME TO PAY WITH CONFIDENCE TO MY- THESE. THEY WANT. AND SO. IN FEET I KNOW WE'RE GOOD NEXT WEEK ABOUT RECOVERY AND I'M I'M LOOKING TO THAT- THAT PP IS GOING TO BE A HUGE ISSUE AND IT'S NOT JUST A ISSUE FOR RIGHT NOW WITH WE WITH OUR SNIFFS AND HOSPITALS AND SO ON BUT AS WE LOOK TO THE FUTURE AND A RE OPENING- I. THINK IT IS MY BACK AND WE ARE IN IN DEBT THREE- ONE OF THOSE- AND I THINK IT TAKES A SCHOOL FOR THIS FOR THIS CONDITION BECAUSE OF THE- SCHOOLS. THERE IS. AND I WORRY. THE PEOPLE PROFESSION ALREADY STRUGGLING TO GET PP IT'S NOT JUST THE MASKS IT'S NOT JUST THE GLOVES IT'S FACE SHIELDS IT'S- PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT ITS HEAD WHERE. AND A VARIETY AND MATH AND GLOVES AND SO- WE KNOW THAT MOST DENTAL OFFICES ARE DOWN NOW- AND ONLY SENIOR URGENCY PATRONS PRETTY BEEN STRUGGLING TO GET PP. AB FOR OUR- THIS IS SOME CAL WHERE THERE ARE PROVIDERS THAT THESE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO END UP IN EMERGENCY ROOMS- THE PLACES THAT REALLY AREN'T THE SAFEST BECAUSE THEY'RE SEEKING DENTAL CARE AND I'M I'M VERY WORRIED ABOUT THAT. I WANT TO THANK DOCTOR REGULAR FOR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH WE'RE STARTING TO SEE A LOT OF CHALLENGES WITH WITH THAT. AND I'M VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THAT AS ARE THE- COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH OFFICERS I KNOW THAT THERE'S A AT A MISTER TING AS AND RECEIVE A LETTER OF SOME OF THEIR CONCERNS. ECHO THOSE KIND. AND SUPPORT FOR THAT. AS IT WERE TO HOSPITALS AND THE CHALLENGES HOSPITALS ARE GOING TO FACE- YOU KNOW NOT A HOSPITAL IT EQUAL I REPRESENT. A CAT A GO GO. TRICK WORK ON WE HAVE A LOT OF STE HOSPITALS BEING SICK CRITICAL ACT HOSPITALS AND THEY'RE SMALL AND THEY'RE GOING TO STRUGGLE. SO I ASK THAT THE- HE IS THE OF. IN TASTE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF AT THIS RETROFIT REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE COMING FORWARD- AND A POTENTIAL DELAY FOR THAT BECAUSE- HOW COULD WE POSSIBLY MOVE FORWARD ON THAT WHEN WE KNOW THAT OUR HOSPITALS RIGHT NOW MANY OF THEM ARE ON THE VERGE OF REALLY REALLY STRUGGLING SO IS THERE BEEN ANY CONVERSATION ABOUT. A POTENTIAL- PUSH BACK OF SOME OF THE TIME LINES. THE POTENTIAL FOR ADDITIONAL SUPPORT- FOR THOSE GOV HOSPITALS ESPECIALLY THOSE. THAT ARE NOT PARTS OF MAJOR HOSPITAL SYSTEMS THAT DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES. I GUESS BEFORE. ALTERNATE OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE ADAM DORSEY AND THEN MARK ON A WATCH AWAY AS WELL. HELLO THIS IS ADAM DORSEY DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND SO. YOU KNOW WHAT I CAN SAY THAT I MEAN THERE'S A OF A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT WAYS THAT WERE HEARING FROM HOSPITALS IN IN HEARING ABOUT THE SUPPORT THAT'S NEEDED AND CERTAINLY OVER THE ERRORS THE SEISMIC REQUIREMENTS OR SOMETHING. THAT ALWAYS HAD WILLING TO. WILLINGNESS TO DO EVALUATE RE. ON A CASE BY CASE BASIS- DEPENDING ON WHAT WAS NEEDED- BUT I WILL TURN IT OVER TO. SERVICES AGENCY. FOR ANY ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON ON THAT TYPICALLY. THANK YOU DOCTOR I THANK YOU ADAM AND THEN THANK YOU DOCTOR WORK FOR THAT QUESTION LET ME JUST ADD THERE'S TWO PIECES THAT I'D LIKE TO RESPOND THE FIRST IS THAT PEACE AROUND THE DATA COMPONENTS SO WE PROVIDED IN.

STATIONS AS WELL AS I SEE USE THAN CASE NOW ADD THAT WE PROVIDE TO THE GOVERNOR MORNING SO THAT IS ALSO MADE A BILL SIR HAPPY TO FOLLOW UP IN MAKES THAT YOU IN STAFF LINKS OF THOSE IN TERMS. HI SO I MAKE CITY AS ADAM ALLUDED TO THAT A SOMETHING THEY WE ARE SO. AT TO LOOK IN AND IT'S THAT WE HAVE BEEN LOOKING AT- PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC- AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE TAKE SERIOUSLY. HAVE TO BALANCE BOTH THE ABILITY FOR HOSPITALS TO BE READY- IN THE EVENT OF AN EARTHQUAKE AND MAKE SURE THAT I HAD THAT THE- THAT. POSSIBLE TO ME SURE THAT THE STATE. OUT BUT WE RECOGNIZE THAT AND ALSO THE FINANCIAL TO SOME EXTENT AND SO WE'RE HAVING TO BALANCE THAT. CERTAINLY WOULD HAPPY TO FOLLOW UP AS PART OF THE MAY REVISION AND HAVE THAT CONVERSATION WITH. THANK YOU A COUPLE MORE QUESTIONS MISTER CHAIR IF THAT'S OKAY- FIRST FOUR ONE THIS I WANT TO. COMMEND THE GOVERNOR ON THE CALL FOR THE- HEALTH KERR VOLUNTEER. HELP LAUNCH YOUR CORE- AND- THE AMAZING RESPONSE WE SAW WITHOUT- ON. UNBELIEVABLE QUITE FRANKLY AND- AND JUST GOES TO. SHOW THAT- THERE ARE THERE'S A THERE ARE A LOT OF FOLKS OUT THERE WHO REALLY WANT TO REALLY WANT TO BE ENGAGED. AND BE HELPFUL- DO ONE. YEAH AS MAYOR WHEREBY MANY. MANY I DON'T MIND OVERCOME IN MY JUST BUT I WOULD GATHER THAT THERE ARE MANY OTHERS IN THE STATE HAVE LAID OFF STAFF. AND ARE FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTERS ARE LAYING OFF STAFF- AND- DID THE IT IS IT DID OR IS THE IS THE HEALTH CORPS LOOKING TO THOSE- NOW LAID OFF- STAFF WHO ARE FAMILIAR WITH SPINDLES HAVE WORKED IN HOSPITALS CURRENT CERTAIN. CAN HOSPITALS AND HAVE OF CURRENT LOOKING THEM TOO AT THE INITIALLY- IN COMMUNITIES TO- HELP WITH THIS- AND THE REASON I ASK IS THAT WERE THE VOLUNTEERS ARE ARE ACTUALLY MY UNDERSTANDING IS PAID SO IT'S A- THEY ARE GETTING ME FOR THAT. THESE OTHER PEOPLE ARE NOW ON UNEMPLOYMENT SO. ESSENTIALLY THE SPENDING MONEY IN TWO DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS POSSIBLY THAT WE MIGHT HAVE TO SO- HABSI ADMINISTRATION READ TWO. OF AT AND COMMUNICATE WITH THE- NIXON THE HOSPITAL SIBLEY YOU SOME OF THESE ARE NOW LAY OFF- STAFF MEMBERS- IN THE HEALTH CORPS- AS A WAY TO EXPEDITE- FILLING THAT OUT. THIS IS MARCO MEETS WITH THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY I DON'T BELIEVE WE HAVE CERTAINLY CAN TAKE THAT OFF LINE AND GET BACK TO YOU. THANK YOU. REGARDING ANTIBODY TESTING- WE HEARD I DON'T KNOW MAYBE TEN DAYS AGO THAT- THROUGH STANFORD A COLLABORATIVE THAT THERE WOULD BE- IMMINENT APPROVAL OF- ANTIBODY TESTING- AND- I KNOW THAT THERE HAVE BEEN ANTIBODY TESTS DONE BUT I HAVE. SOUNDS MEANT HOW'S THAT EFFORT HAS THERE BEEN FDA APPROVAL OF THE END OF MY BODY TESTING WHAT IS THE STATUS ABOUT. SENATOR PAT I MEAN SIX SORRY ADD DOCTOR WED- APOLOGIES ABOUT THAT AT ON THAT ON THAT STAND FOR CASTTHE STANFORD CAST- WE INITIALLY THOUGHT REQUIRED FDA APPROVAL HOWEVER IT DOES NOT REQUIRE AFTER THE APPROVAL WHICH BECAUSE IT IS A CLEAR LAP- AND IT IS THE PROPERTY. OF TEST IT IS APPROVED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND CAN BE PUT INTO USE- AND SO WE'RE WORKING CLOSELY WITH OUR STANFORD PARTNER. TO SEE HOW WE- I WOULD. AROUND THE ENTIRE CAST AND PRODUCE BECAUSE THE VALIDITY AND THE RELIABILITY AS YOU KNOW AS A POSITION AND SOME OF THE SITE BACKGROUND. AT THAT SINCE IS REALLY IMPORTANT AND IT WILL TAKE SOME TIME TO GET THAT A TIE TREATED A PRO. IS WE'LL WORK VERY WITH OUR STANFORD COLLEAGUES AND MAKE SURE THAT THAT HAPPENS BUT FROM A FEDERAL PERSPECTIVE THAT TEST HAS BEEN APPROVED- AND CAN BE YEARS. I WASN'T AWARE OF THAT SO I APPRECIATE THAT AND THEN MY FINAL QUESTION IS ON HEALTH RELATED BUT IT'S EQUAL IT'S VERY VERY IMPORTANT. TO MY COMMUNITIES I REPRESENT A DISTRICT THAT HAS NO ENTITIES LET THAT ARE GREATER THAN FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND IN POPULATION. SO WHEN THE CARES AT WITH THE CARES ACT IN THE MONEY FOR GOVERNMENT SO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS- EVERY CAN BE PUTTING COUNTY AND WHAT LIVE. IS THAT FIVE THOUSAND THREE. I TODAY IT SEEMS NO INFORMATION ABOUT HOW THE SMALLER JURISDICTIONS ARE ACTUALLY GOING TO RECEIVE FEDERAL MONEY- AND- THAT'S A QUESTION I GET A LOT HOW IS IT GOING TO HAPPEN. HOW MUCH WITH BE TESTING THE CAT. AND SO I'D LIKE TO KNOW WHERE IS WHERE ARE WE ON THAT- IN OUR OUR COMMUNITY GOING TO HOW WE GONNA GET THAT IN A XIN. DESPERATELY WANTED NOW I UNDERSTAND RIGHT. MAYBE I MAYBE YOU CAN CALL. THE RISK TO THE MY FOR FROM FOR THE CARES ACT RELATED TO OUR WORK BUT THERE IS FOR THE- SINS OF HUNDRED THOUSAND OR UNDER. SO THOSE RESTRICTIONS AS WELL ARE THEY GOING TO SEE REDUCTION IN THE AMOUNT THAT THEY MIGHT GET SO THAT THE STATE- COOPS SOME OF THAT THROUGH. FOR ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS BECAUSE I THINK THAT WOULD BE A CHALLENGE AS WELL- SO- AND UP THAT WOULD BE REALLY HELPFUL. ASSEMBLY MEMBER WOULD IT WHEN IT COMES TO THE- FEDERAL MONEY WHICH IS APPROXIMATELY FIFTEEN POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS. YOU'VE IDENTIFIED VERY SIGNIFICANT ISSUE WHICH THAT GOVERNOR HAS ALL BLACKED OUT FOR THE REST OF THE NATION IS THAT. WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS IS SYSTEMS REACHES STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ACROSS THE SPECTRUM AND THAT FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND CAP. THE THING. YOUR CITIES OAKLAND AND LONG BEACH ON RECEIVE THAT STUCK REALLY FUN MONEY BIG THEY FALL THAT I HUNDRED THOUSAND CAPTAINS WE HAVE RAISED IT AT IN RUSSIA PRESENTED AS WE KNOW THAT ALL STATE SENT ON THE SAME THERE ARE WHERE THERE'S NO. PRESSURE AND SUMMER. THAT CONGRESS THAT CAN MAKE ADJUSTMENTS TO THAT FORMULA AS PART OF A BROADER PACKAGE A FEDERAL FUNDING. YOUR WEATHER COMES THIS WEEK OR IN THE NEXT SEVERAL WEEKS THAT'S SOMETHING. HIS WROTE. AND IN FAXED THE GOVERNOR HAS CALLED FOR ONE TRILLION DOLLARS IN STATE AND LOCAL ASSISTANCE THAT FROM CONGRESS TO HELP COVER SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT WE'RE FACING OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS WHEN IT COMES SPECIFICALLY TO THE ALLOCATION. YOU OR THE POINT THREE POWER. UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THAT FOR CONSCIOUS THAT IS AND SEVERAL BUILDINGS OF DOLLARS IS ON WAY SO WE SHOULD HAVE A UPDATE WITHIN THE- COUPLE. OF DAYS IN TERMS OF THAT WE IS THE CALIFORNIA PLAN FROM THE TREASURY DEPARTMENT BELIEVES IS THAT ALL OF THAT MONEY SHOULD BE ALLOCATED BY APRIL FOURTH WHICH IS. ALLEN SPOKE DATE THOSE GOVERNOR. HELP FOR THE ACTUAL CASH IWILL BE RECEIVED FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PRETTY SOON WHEN IT COMES TO THE ACTUAL SPENDING OUR MONEY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS PROVIDED SOME GUIDANCE WE HAVE HAD SOME ISSUES WITH THE ITEMS THAT THEY PROVIDED ALTHOUGH IT IS THE GENERAL SOME THAT WERE. WERE HOPE. GUIDANCE. DID THE SPENDING PRETTY FOR BECAUSE AS WE COVER IN THIS YEAR. THERE ARE SO MANY FACETS TO THIS. THERE THE DIRECTOR'S. HELPING VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES THEY'RE STEALING WITH CASELOAD INCREASES ARE ALSO. GAPS OUR STATE HAS LOST ITS CROSS COUNTRY ARE SAYING BUT THE ACTUAL ALLOCATION OF THAT FEDERAL I'M SORRY AND IT STATE. MY NAME. IS SOMEWHERE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD IT OR NOT. NOW THIS. HE'S NOW AND THEN WHEN IT COMES TO LOCAL GUY THAT THEY HAVE THE FREEDOM TO MAKE THEIR OWN DECISIONS ON HOW TO SPEND THAT MONEY WITHIN THE GUIDELINES SET. OKAY DAIS I'LL PASS IT OVER TO CHRISTY ON OUR TEAM IN CASE SHE ANYTHING ADDITIONAL. THANK YOU THE BACK THAT THAT YOU COVER ALL OF HYPE. AND THE OTHER I WOULD ADD IS RELATIVE TO THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT SHARE THERE'S FIVE POINT EIGHT BILLION THAT CAN BE. ACCESSED DIRECTLY BY THOSE LARGER INTO LARGE ANTI AS- AT AM. LARGEST THAT REPRESENTS ABOUT THIRTY FOUR CENT AT THE TOP. IN THOSE LOW BODIES. YEAH HOWEVER DURING THAT IN A LARGE WAY BUT PROBABLY IS NOT TING SOME OF THOSE. I'D AS LONG AS IT WASN'T PREVIOUSLY AND- ANY BUDGET PLAN IN TERMS OF SUPPLANTING THOSE FINES AND BUT- RELATE IT NINETEEN IT BROADLY USABLE AND WITH THE EXCEPTION OF BACK FEELING LOST REVENUES WHICH IS AN ISSUE WE HAVE REYES AND RIGHT IS. IT FAIR TO SAY THEN ONE NIGHT WHEN I MASS BY LOCAL GOVERNMENT THAT QUESTION WE JUST NEED TO WAIT UNTIL THE MAY RE BOXES OUT FOR THE SMALLER STATIONS REALLY DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY MIGHT BE GETTING HOW THEY MIGHT BE ABLE TO GET. I AM OR WHEN TO BE ABLE TO GET THE BEST ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION AND THEN CHRIS THIS WAY IT IS RIGHT NOW THE SMALL GOVERNMENTS ARE AN ELIGIBLE FOR A DIRECT. WILL SHARE. THE STATE. I'M DATING ON DAY ARE STILL HAVE TO DECIDE HOW TO ALLOCATE THAT WERE OBVIOUSLY FACING A LOT OF CHALLENGES. A CERTAIN WE DECISIONS THAT HE MAKES WILL BE TO SPEND THAT MONEY IN A WAY THAT BENEFITS THE WHOLE STATE BUT WHEN IT COMES. EFFORT. OKAY LOCAL. MAPS SO THE POSSIBILITY THAT SMALLER JURISDICTIONS MIGHT NOT GET MONEY WHERE LARGER JURISDICTIONS MIGHT IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING UNLESS CONGRESS TAKES ACTION. TWO RIGHT NOW LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THAT ARE ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND. I DON'T HAVE ANY OF THOSE SO THAT'S MIKE WE ASK MY CONCERN I DON'T HAVE ANY OF YES. YES IT WOULD BECAUSE RIGHT NOW ON THE MONEY GOES TO THOSE GOVERNMENTS OR TO THE STATE- SO THE MONEY THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ABOUT FIVE. WHICH I KNOW. ARE NOT YOUR DAY THANK CANNOT APPLY TO. THAT'S NICE. THE STATE OUT NOT IS A NAY REVISION NOT IN TERMS OF HOW GOVERNOR ONE TO SPEND MONEY. BUT THERE'S A POSSIBILITY THAT THAT SOME OF THE THAT THAT LARGER JURISDICTIONS COULD GET A HIGHER PERCENTAGE OF THEY MIGHT BE ELIGIBLE. THEN RURAL JUST WHAT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT IS WE'RE ALWAYS FIGHTING IN RURAL DISTRICTS FOR ARE JUST OUR FAIR SHARE. AS NOT EVEN GET OUR FAIR SHARE HERE. I I'M A LITTLE HELLO I AM VERY CONCERNED AS ARE MY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ON THAT. I JUST WANT TO CLOSE BY SAYING YOU KNOW I ASK DIRECT QUESTIONS AND I'M VERY POINTED IN MY QUESTIONS AND- AND BECAUSE I'M I'M CONCERNED AND- I DO IT IN THE SPIRIT OF REALLY WANTING TO MAKE THIS. BETTER FOR ALL OF US THAT WE CAN TAKE THIS TO THE TO THE NEXT LEVEL AND I HOPE IT WILL FIND A WAY TO DO THAT- WE HAVE- OF. THOSE UNIQUE RELATIONSHIPS WITH OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS- WE- ELECTED. I EMITS DISTRICT AND- I EXT. OF WITH MISTER GILL WOULD DO SHE THROUGH FIRES AND FLOODS- THE STRENGTH OF OUR EMERGENCY RESPONSE IN THOSE EVENTS WAS THE ABILITY TO ACT. WITH PRETTY MUCH ANYWHERE HE WANTED TO WHENEVER I NEEDED TO GET INFORMATION WHICH IS QUITE A LOT WHAT WE'RE EXPERIENCING NOW I WANT. THE MOST CURRENT INFORMATION TO THOSE PEOPLE WHO ASK FOR IT THE- I'M IN IN A DISASTER OUR- HAITIAN WHETHER IT'S GOOD NEWS OR BAD NEWS IS REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT TO BESIDE AND THEIR ABILITY TO PLAN FOR FUTURE ASKING. OF USING US AS A RESOURCE- WE FEEL LIKE WE'VE BEEN NOT USED AT ALL QUITE FRANKLY AND- WOULD HOPE IN THE FUTURE YOU CAN FIND A WAY. LEGISLATURE THE EXT.

THE STRUCTURE THAT'S THE FIRST PIECE OF THE SECOND PIECE IS REGARDING SAVINGS- IN THE VARIOUS PROGRAMS AND WE HAVE BEEN WORKING VERY HARD. WITH THE MISSION IN THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES TO IDENTIFY- SEVERAL PIECES OF DATA THAT ARE ESSENTIAL FOR US UNDERSTAND EXACTLY HOW MUCH YOU HAVE IN SAVINGS IN THESE DIFFERENT PROGRAMS INCLUDING. THERE'S THAT ARE ARE CLOSED WHETHER OR NOT AND- AS- PROGRAMS ARE FULLY SUBSCRIBED IF THEY ARE OPEN. UP AND THEN THERE BEEN SOME OTHER ISSUES AROUND ATTENTIONAL DOUBLE PAYMENT FOR STUDENTS AND FOR CHILDREN IN VOUCHER PROGRAMS THAT WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO GET SOME. GRASS THE MAGNITUDE AS- BEAT THE SHORT ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION IS THAT WE HAVE BEEN USING SAVINGS IN THESE PROGRAMS TO COVER THE COST OF POLICY DECISIONS THAT WE MAKE IT WOULD DRESS CODE BUT NOT. SO SAMPLE WE WAIVE FAMILY IS IN ALL OF OUR PROGRAMS AND HAVE BEEN USING SAVINGS FROM THIS PROGRAM TO COVER THE COST. I'M WE ALSO SEEN THAT OR- CLOSE WE'VE ENSURED THEY'VE THE VOUCHER SIDE THEY'VE RECEIVED AT LEAST THIRTY DAYS OF PAYMENT BUT IS IN ADDITION TO THE TEN DAY THEY ALREADY HAVE BUILT IN THEIR CONTRACTS- SO THAT'S ANOTHER US MINNESOTA IT'D COST WITH PAYMENT FOR FAMILY. THEY WOULD HAVE OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE BEEN. AS A VARIABLE SCHEDULES ON THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT COSTS THAT WE'RE CURRENTLY- TRACKING AND UTILIZING SAVINGS TO COVER SO. THERE ARE MANY THINGS HAPPENING CURRENTLY IN THE CHILD CARE SPACES AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH YOU- TO IDENTIFY WHAT RESOURCE AVAILABLE AND WE CAN UTILIZE THOSE FUNDS. THE US. THANK YOU I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY THE PIZZA THERE IS A GREAT APPRECIATION OF WHAT WE'RE DOING TO DATE THERE'S STILL AND I MADE EIGHT AND- I KNOW LEADERSHIP FROM THE ASSEMBLY HAS PUSHED ON THIS I KNOW IT'S BEEN A LETTER FROM THE LET'S SAY IT'S CAUCUS PUSHING ON WAS PROVIDERS THE STATE AND WE'VE GOT AN ACCESS ISSUE HASN'T GONE AWAY. WORST AS SOME OF THESE PROGRAMS ART ARE TINKERING FINANCIALLY BUT WE NEED TO REALIZE THAT WE HAVE IT'S AN ISSUE TODAY WITH THE SENSOR WORKERS OUT THERE- STRUGGLING SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE STEP IT UP AND SERVE THEM. THANK YOU. YOU MISTER BRECHT. DEFINITION THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN WANNA THE KNOWLEDGE BOTH YOU AND THE SPEAKER FOR INCLUDING DOCTOR WOULD NOT AYE IN TODAY'S HEARING I IN OUR CAPACITY IS THE ROCK BUT POLICY AND HEALTH AND GOVERNMENT ORDERS. ORGANIZE MY QUESTIONS FOR. FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THAT COMMITTEE- BUT WHICH I CHAIR. ALL START WITH THE- CALIFORNIA'S THIS DISASTER ASSISTANCE ACT AND FOR THOSE OF YOU NOT INTIMATELY FAMILIAR WITH THAT. THIS JACKET AUTHORIZES THE REIMBURSEMENTS AND- IN FACT THIS IN PLACE- PARTIALLY. TO AVOID PARALYSIS OF GOVERNMENT RESPONSE IN THE TIME OF PURCHASE TO SET A FORMULA OF WHICH THERE CAN BE EXPECTED REIMBURSEMENT- STATE ROOM LEVEL. PERFECTLY IT. ALLOW RESEARCH FIVE FOR COST BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THE REMAINING COST 75% OF THAT IS BORN BY THE STATE GOVERNMENT LEAVING ROUGHLY SIX POINT 25% FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT- TO. INHERIT YOU KNOW WITH FEW EXCEPTIONS- THE AW PROHIBITS THE STATE SHARE FOR ANY OVER PROJECT FROM EXCEEDING THAT 75% OF THE STAY ELIGIBLE COSTS. THERE ARE A HANDFUL DARKLY OF LEGISLATIVE THE OUTLINE DISASTERS WHICH ALLOW THE STATE TO COVER UP TO. PERCENT NON FEDERAL. AWESOME THAT LIST INCLUDES THE NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE LOMA PRIETA EARTHQUAKE THE NINETEEN NINETY ONE EAST BAY FIRE THE NINETY FOUR NORTHRIDGE EARTHQUAKE THE TWO THOUSAND ONE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WILDFIRES AND THE TWO THOUSAND THREE CENTS A MINUTE OF QUAKES. EARTHQUAKE UNFORTUNATELY MORE RECENT EFFORTS TO INCREASE THE STATE SURE DISASTER MITIGATION COSTS FROM 75% TO A FULL 1100% HAVE FAILED TO REACH THE GOVERNOR'S DESK. FOR EXAMPLE DURING THE TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY TWENTY SESSION. AB TWO FORTY SEVEN BY- AT THAT POINT ASSEMBLY MEMBER DOLLY NOW CENTER DOLLY- AS WELL AS- IT BEFORE ONE. OF OUR CALLERS WERE GAP.

THEY'VE TAKEN AND THE GOVERNOR'S TAKEN TO SLOW THE TRANSMISSION COVER NINETEEN I THINK I'VE HEARD IT SAID A COUPLE TIMES I COULDN'T AGREE MORE I'LL BE PROUD TO. HELP I AM RIGHT. HE SAID THAT IT'S TIME TO SEE WHAT WE CAN DO BETTER. PRODUCT KEY FOR EXAMPLE. WOULD PROVIDE SAFE ISOLATION CAPACITY FOR TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE CALIFORNIANS HOMELESS YOUR CALIFORNIA. IS A PERFECT EXAMPLE WHERE WE'VE CREATED UNCERTAINTY THROUGH THE ADMINISTRATION OF CDA- JUST A FEW DAYS AGO THE GOVERNOR KNOWLEDGE SOME OF THE- YEAH JUST. OUR LOCAL INCLUDING SOME MY COUNTIES TO QUICKLY SECURE- OVER SIX THOUSAND HOTEL ROOMS. AND I THINK WE SHOULD THAT- MY CONCERN. COMES FROM THE FACT THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE ARE TO TAKE THE NEXT STEPS AND EXECUTE ON THE SECURING OF THE ROPES ARM. AT ALL TO DO WITH WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE COSTS OF COMMITMENT SERVICE. OFFICIAL OVER HEAD MEALS UTILITIES. IN THE INDIVIDUALS REMAIN ISOLATED. HOW ABOUT SECURITY- WRAPAROUND SERVICES IT'S SATURDAY AND I JUST WANNA MAKE THE POINT DOESN'T MATTER YOUR HOW BOLD DATA. THE STATE. IS IF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS PARTICULARLY THOSE THAT MY COLLEAGUE- DOCTOR WOULD MENTIONED THAT DIDN'T RECEIVE THE MORE FLEXIBLE FUNDING POTS ABLE TO OR YOU'RE JUST TO CASH STRAPPED FOR TOO WORRIED TO IMPLEMENT. I ASKED THE REPRESENTS THE PART OF FINANCE AS WELL AS ALWAYS TO EXPLAIN TO ME THE COMMUNICATION PROCESS KIND OF GO BOTH WAYS I'M GONNA I'M GONNA START WITH THE FOLLOWING THREE QUESTIONS. FIRST HOW DOES HE ADMITS SURE THE SUPER TO IMPLEMENT THE PACIFIC DISASTER RESPONSE EFFORTS SUCH AS PROJECT CRANKY DOES THE ROLLOUT INCLUDES PROCESS. INFORMATION REGARDING EXPECT AS ELIGIBLE FOR REIMBURSEMENT TO HOW THE NEWSMEN MINISTRATION HAD A LOCAL GOVERNMENT REIMBURSE FOR REQUEST FOR THE COSTS INCURRED DURING THE RESPONSE EFFORTS AND HAS THE ADMINISTRATION CONSIDERED ADDING CO TEAM TO THE WEST OF THE ELIGIBLE 41100% STATE REIMBURSEMENT PURSUANT TO CD.

ROOM HE ALTERNATE OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE MARCO. THE OTHER QUESTIONS AND- I HAVE A VAGUE ACTUALLY DIRECTOR GELLER DUTY SINCE THIS IS A THEME A PROGRAM- WELL A LACK RIGHT A LITTLE BIT MORE ON THE- BUT THE QUESTIONS ASSEMBLY. TO CLARIFY- UP ROOM KEY OPERATION IS BEING FUNDED THROUGH WHAT WE CALL DIRECT FEDERAL ASSISTANCE ITS JOB AT CENTER I CATEGORY- MADE AVAILABLE- THROUGH THE MAJOR DISASTER. THAT HAS BEEN BY THE GOVERNOR SO WE'RE LEVERAGING THOSE BUILT THAT PROGRAM TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE REIMBURSEMENT TO OZ- AND THEN- THAT TIES IN WITH. THIS WILL OPEN A STATE FUNDING TO BE ABLE TO BACK UP ALL OF THAT THE CDA OR THE FOR A PRO. IS A STANDALONE. YEAH THAT COURT SHOULD. THANK YOU DRAW LET ME MAYBE DRE DOWN THE LITTLE BIT MORE WASN'T SICK IS FUNDED BY THE I THINK I WAS SICK THAT SHE A SUPPLE THE LOCKER MY UNDER.

FOR MAKING A MENTAL. IN THOSE JURISDICTIONS THAT FALL UNDER THE FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND I THINK IT WOULD PROVIDE. SOME LEVEL OF CERTAINTY THAT WOULD REDUCE ANY PARALYSIS WORD WERE SEEING AS FAR AS MOVING FORWARD ON SOME OF THE- MANAGER LOCAL. THAT'S WOULD BE FAIR CAN THE FIRST ROUND FEDERAL WENT TO THE LARGER URBAN AREAS LET ME TRANSITION AT THIS POINT AND TOUCH ON THE PROVIDER ISSUE THAT BOTH DOCTOR WOULDN'T DR RANDALL RAISED AS OUR IT'S TO OUR BUDGET GOING FORWARD NOT SO MUCH. WORDS AND- BEEN AROUND THIS BUILDING NOW I REMEMBER- THE LEGISLATIVE RESPONSE TO THE GREAT RECESSION I REMEMBER THE DIFFICULT DECISIONS- THEY WERE BUT BEFORE BOTH THE EXECUTIVE AND THE LEGISLATURE AT THAT TIME. BUT THE CRISIS IS ILLUSTRATED TO THE STATE THE DIRE NEED TO NOT JUST. DO THE STATUS QUO WHEN IT COMES TO. INVESTMENTS OR PROVIDERS BUT ACTUALLY MAYBE DOUBLE DOWN OUR EFFORTS AND I REALIZE THAT'S NEW SPENDING BUT I HOPE IT'S NEW SPENDING THAT MY COLLEAGUES AND GOVERNOR TAKE. SERIOUSLY I LIVE IN MERCED COUNTY ONE OF THE COUNTIES THAT SUFFICIENT OR THE WORST PROVIDER SHORTAGES- IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THEN CAN ASSEMBLY CISCO HAVE NEARLY THREE TIMES THE NUMBER OF DOCTORS PER ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND RESIDENTS THAT WE DO. AND THAT. WRITER WHICH IS- EVEN MORE DANGEROUS OBVIOUSLY DURING A CRISIS LIKE THIS AND AGAIN I AM FULLY- EYES WIDE OPEN AND RECOGNIZED EVERYONE IN THE STATE. IN THE COUNTRY.

BUT THIS AGAIN SHOULD EMPHASIZE TO US WE'VE NOT DONE ENOUGH THE LAST SEVERAL DECADES IN MAKING SURE THAT THEY'RE ENOUGH NOR THIS. PHYSICIANS NOTHING APPEARS. COMING UP CRISIS I HOPE. WITH THE MAYBE WITH THE TOP TO THE BOTTOM. SOME THIS. GROUP AND FIND A WAY AND THE WILL AN THE- TO DOUBLE DOWN ON THAT INVESTMENT. REGARDING CAN IN MAY TOPIC AND THIS IS BEEN ON MY MIND- AS WE STRUGGLE TO. DEAL WITH THIS CRISIS AND- CAN YOU PLEASE FACE HAVING- EARLY RELEASE OF INMATES AND PERHAPS SOME DISORGANIZATION TO THAT IS DOCTOR WOULD. SEVERAL YEARS AGO WE DID LEGISLATION HERE IN THIS BODY- RELATIVE TO. WHAT WAS DEEMED HOSPITAL PATIENT DUMPING. AT LEAST STANDARDS IN PLACE HOSPITALS TO EXERT STEPS YOU MAY REMEMBER THIS TO- PRIOR TO PUT SOMEONE ON THE STREET AND I THINK I'VE CERTAINLY HAS DIRECTED MY STAFF TO GO BACK AND LOOK AT LEGISLATION AND CONSIDER CRAFTING- A POLICY SIMILAR WHERE WE CAN ASK CITIES ARE IN. OTHERS TO HELP THIS ONE. BOTH FIFTY COMMUNITIES SO I'D LIKE TO PUT BEFORE EVERY FOR CONSIDERATION. THE FINAL THING I WANT TO RAISE. THE SPEED HI DRAFT A LETTER EARLY IN THIS CRISIS TO THE GOVERNOR- RELATIVE TO THE LEFT WHICH IS ENGAGEMENT WITH TASK FORCES ARE WE'VE HAD SUBSEQUENT ONES WITH. HIS ALL THIS WE'VE NOT. DRAW THE CONCLUSION AND- TODAY'S HEARING I HOPE WE CAN- DOUBLE LEFFERTS TO ARRIVE AT THAT INTERFACE. LEGISLATIVE I THINK THE- DOCTOR. CLEAR THERE IS ESSENTIAL IT THE LEGISLATURE WITH THESE MEMBERS WE ARE ACTUALLY SPOKESPERSONS FOR THE STATE IN OUR DISTRICTS ARE ABLE TO ENGAGE COMMUNITY AND BE AN ASSET TO THE EXECUTIVE AS THEY DEAL WITH THIS DIFFICULT- IN CLOSING. I WANT TO ASK THE DIRECTOR.

QUESTION COME UP- IT AND IF THEY CANNOT BE FILLED AT THE REGIONAL LEVEL THAN OF COURSE THEY'VE COME UP WITH THE STATE- WELL. DO YOU. HAVE A MEDICAL HEALTH COORDINATION CENTER OF THE NATION AND PRIORITIZATION OF WHERE THE- I NEEDED MY- BASED ON THE RESOURCES THAT WE HAVE A THIS IS A STANDARD- A PROCESS THAT WE HAVE IN PLACE HERE IN CALIFORNIA WHEN WE MANAGE- OF SCARCE RESOURCES DURING HIS AT. AND WHY THIS PROJECT- CONTRACT IN THIS PIPELINE OF COMMODITIES SO WHERE DOES IS THAT IT DOES PROVIDE AS WITH- OF A RELIABLE- AND SUSTAINABLE- SOURCE OF. COMMODITIES THAT WE CAN OF COURSE GET DOWN TO THE LOCAL- AFTER THESE WORDS NEEDED MOST- THIS IS CRITICAL FOR US BECAUSE THROUGHOUT THE COURSE OF THIS OF. THE CHALLENGES OF BEING ABLE TO GET. HE FROM SOURCES AROUND THE WORLD NOT JUST NOT JUST FOR IT BUT EVEN DOMESTIC SOURCES- HAS BEEN A HUGE CHALLENGE AND AS I MET EARLIER FOR ALL THIS THE ALL THE SAME REASONS OF COMPETITION AND- FRAUD AND MANY OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE BEEN SEEING THROUGHOUT THE- THROUGHOUT THE EVOLUTION OF THIS PROCESS. SO ONCE WE GET THE COMMODITIES IN WE WILL WE WILL OUR OUR PLAN IS. THE AMOUNT OF TIME THAT THEY'RE SITTING IN A- ELSE AND REALLY. START PUSHING THOSE OUT OF REALLY ALMOST AS SOON AS WE'RE GETTING THEM- TO AREAS THERE.

THE USE SHOULD MEN STATE GOVERNMENTS HAVE BUSINESS YOU'VE EVER ENTERED INTO AND SO. THE NEED TO ACCURATE INFORMATION CONSTITUENTS ON WHAT WAS ACTUALLY HAPPENING WAS TOUGH. I REMEMBER ONE DAY A WOMAN IN ORDER TO PUT ON FACEBOOK THAT ORANGE COUNTY SEVEN PM TO PM CURVE. NO THEY DON'T DID STOP FOR. PATIENT SO THAT IT SEEMS THE BEGINNING OF IT LET ME ASK YEAH THERE IS OF MARCH TWENTY SEVENTH. LA TIMES STORY- THAT ABOUT. HELLO TO TWO THOUSANDS THAT CALIFORNIA HAD BUILT A LARGE SUPPLY OF. THE MILLION AND NINETY FIVE RESPIRATORS TWENTY FOUR HUNDRED VENTILATORS KIT SET UP FOR TWENTY ONE THOUSAND ADDITIONAL PATIENT BEDS WHENEVER- THIS ALL WAS DISBANDED BEFORE ANYBODY ON THIS COMMITTEE OR IT ASSEMBLY WAS ELECTED TO DO YOU HAVE ANY HISTORICAL. KNOWLEDGE OF WHY THOSE AS WERE SAYS THEY WERE BOUGHT FOR THE AVIAN FLU OUTBREAK TO BE. SURE SHE- OKAY. THANKS FOR THE CALL THE ARE WELL ME JUST START OFF SAYING NOT NOT ABOUT A BIG PORTION OF AS I UNDERSTAND IT- THE- ISSUES WITH THE OP ALL COMMODITIES OR TALK ABOUT HOW TO DO IT FOR ASIAN THE BILL THEIR TIME. LIFE IN THE BILL TO MAINTAIN ALL OVER THE COURSE THE THERE WERE SOME THAT WERE UP YOU MY OF THE MATCH. IN CASE OF ASKED WE HAD LIKE WHEN WE USED SIX ADDRESS ALL WE USE SOME SHALL. LARGE NUMBERS OF THE COMMODITIES TO SUPPORT- CATASTROPHIC FIRE DISASTERS- AND- AND SOME SOME- ALL I. SIMPLY JUST THEM OR LOST THEIR SHELF LIFE ANDI THINK- ALL OVER THE YEARS. THE FOCUS- WAS TO. TAKE SOME OF THOSE COMMODITIES AND REPURPOSE THEM IT ALSO SUPPORTED REGIONAL CAPABILITIES BY PUSHING THEM THAT OUT BY PREVIOUS THAT A PART OF THE STATE LEVEL AND PLOT OUT YOUR LOCAL PARK. OR GUARD. SOME OF THE MODERN THANK YOU. BY THE WAY OTHER WORDS LAUGH OR THAT WHERE DID THE IN SOME FOR. AND A SOME TO SOMETHING MILLION MASS THAT WE HAD A- ALL OF THAT HAVE BEEN YOU HOW YOU LIVE UP. BENT IS IT PART YOU'RE PLANNING THIS TO HE SOME THE ORDER WERE CURRENTLY DOING TO BUILD BACK UP THAT STATE STOCKPILE. THIS OKAY LET ME US ON THE CONTRACT HAS BEEN- ABOUT A LITTLE BIT SO YOU DON'T NEED TO CONTRACT TO KNOW YOU WELL PAID FIVE DOLLARS A MASK- IT. IS THAT A GOOD EIGHT. IT LOOKS LIKE FANS GOT EM AND HONEYWELL WILL YOU DO IT FOR LESS THAN A DOLLAR I SEE SOME OTHER CONTRACTS AS HIGH AS ALMOST EIGHT DOLLARS I WENT INTO THE NEGOTIATION ON THE- MASK. I REALLY COMMENT ON- WEAR OUT ON UP FOR MASS COST- I CAN TELL YOU THAT- WE BELIEVE THAT THE TEAM THAT NEGOTIATED TO GET A- VERY GOOD PRICE UP. THE TIME. OF THE- GOSHI ASIANS- WE SAW MASKS. AT ITS HIGHEST TWELVE DOLLARS- AVERAGE OF ABOUT SEVEN DOLLARS. AND THE QUESTION PRICE FOR THESE MASS I THINK WILL BENEFIT THE STATE WE TOOK INTO ACCOUNT MANY THINGS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT- IN PARTICULAR- WITH THE VOLUME OF THE MASTER GETTING TO GET- WILL BE WE THOUGHT WAS A FAIR. DID YOU GO OUT IF YOU GO OUT TO BETTER WAS IT. LIKE A SOLE SOURCE CONTRACT WITH THE COMPANY OR HOW TO HOW TO GO DOWN. PARTICULAR ENTITY- WAS SO SOURCE OF LET ME BE CLEAR THAT- YOU KNOW- AGAIN OF THE WORLDWIDE- A SHORTAGE. A COMPETITION OUT THESE ASSETS IN THE INABILITY. TO BE ABLE TO PRODUCE THIS DOMESTICALLY THIS PARTICULAR SET OF ITEMS- IN FACT THE SUPPLIER OF ALL THIS PP EITHER WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ARE ALL CHINA BASED AND YOU KNOW. THIS IS THIS THAT THE CHALLENGES THAT WE FACE IN CALIFORNIA WE'RE NOT UNIQUE TO CALIFORNIA THIS HAPPENED IN EVERY STATE IN THE UNITED STATES. AS WELL AS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AS WELL AS THE MAJOR PROVIDERS F COMMODITIES SINCE OUR EMMETT. ALL OF THESE- ENTITIES WHAT WERE IN THE SAME EXACT POSITION. AND THEN OF COURSE- BEGAN A OF GRACIOUS- EFFORT TO OF FINE COMMODITIES- AT WHICH THEY PUT A IN A MASSIVE AMOUNT OF COMPETITION. THAT THE POINT IS IN A POSITION WHERE WE NEED TO REALLY A UTILIZED EVERY CAPABILITY THAT WE COULD IN CALIFORNIA I TO BE ABLE TO GET WHAT WE NEED IT. IT WAS REALLY- OF EXISTING RELATIONSHIPS ARE THAT WE HAD AND THE BUYING POWER OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ARE SIZING AND IN SCALE OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO LEVERAGE ALL OF THAT IT WILL BE ABLE TO GET THAT THE THINGS WE NEEDED AND LET AGAIN LET'S BE CLEAR. THESE ARE LIFESAVING DEVICES. THIS CALL THESE ARE CA IN. THE LIVES OF OUR HELP WORKERS AND OTHERS AND- YOU KNOW WHEN YOU'RE IN THE HEAT OF THE BATTLE- AND YOU'RE TRYING TO WORK THROUGH ALL THESE ISSUES ARE THE INTENT IS TO- DO WHAT WE CAN BE ABLE TO ADDRESS WHAT ANY S. AND- AGAIN- ALL WE WILL WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT TIME WHEN THE COURSE OF TIME CORRECT WILL RELEASE AND IN NOT YOU'LL FIND THAT THE- PRICE. WAS A WAS A GOOD BE A CIRCUS. SIR WELL THE REASON FOR MY LINE OF QUESTIONING IS BECAUSE I'M FACT SHEET FROM B. Y. DE AND FROM OF ME THAT SO THEY ARE A WORLD LEADER IN ELECTRIC VEHICLE BATTERY SOLAR AND STORAGE MANUFACTURING. I WON THIS CRISIS BROKE OUT BY THE WAY- BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY AND WHEN THIS CRISIS BROKE OUT. THEY ROUTED THEIR MANUFACTURING RETOOL THAT SO WE COULDPRODUCES MUCH PP FOR HEALTH CARE WORKERS THERE'S A LOT OF COMPANIES IN CALIFORNIA ACROSS THE COUNTRY THEY'RE DOING THE SAME THING SO I WOULD JUST SUGGEST NEXT TIME WE HAVE A LAW. OF TIME AND MONEY THAT WE LOOK OVER THE COULD BE ALL OVER THE STATE TO STOP WEARING TA GIVEN THE GOV YOU ACCESS MONEY IF WE COULD FOR ALL OF US COMPANIES TO SPEND MONEY ON SO JUST FOR WITH THESE LARGE CONTRACTS I HOPE TO YOU IT UP BROTHER NOBODY'S. SOME MONEY. IN IN THE IN THE VISION THAT'LL GIVE US SOME GUIDANCE GOING FORWARD WITH THE TAX STATE PUSH TO JULY FIFTEENTH DO YOU ENVISION A POTENTIAL AUGUST REVISION- SEEING THE RATE OF TAX DOLLARS TO COME INTO THE STATE. SO THE TAXI BEING PUSHED THAT DEFINITELY AFFECTS THE STATE'S CASH FLOW AND SO ONE THING THAT. I FIND THAT VERY BUSY BERMAN THE LAST SEVERAL WEEKS WORKING WITH THE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE IS MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE- SUFFICIENT CASH QUESTION OVER THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS INTEL SOME OF THAT CASH COMES BACK AND- ON JULY FIFTY. COMES TO THE BROADER WHEN THEY'RE NOT HAVE TO BE AND IT NO BUDGET DISCUSSION AFTER JUNE FIFTEENTH AFTER THE FISCAL YEAR STARTS ON JULY FIRST IT'S HARD TO SAY RIGHT NOW BECAUSE THERE IS SO MUCH UNCERTAINTY AND THE FACT THAT SOME. THINGS WILL BE DELAYED FOR JULY I CREATE UNCERTAINTY BECAUSE WE FIVE AND ON THE RIGHT AND UNITS INTO THE STATE TO MAKE OUR ESTIMATES ALL THAT BEING SAID OUR TEAM IS HARD AT WORK RIGHT NOW IT. PROJECTIONS THAT WE KNOW HOW. THE HELL SITUATION AND IT'S OF ALL THEY'RE GOING TO COURSE BEEPER ABOUT SOME THAT AND BE. OF THIS HEARING IN TERMS OF THE MODEL AND HOW WE ARE ALL OF IT AND ALSO THE ECONOMIC IMPACTS WHERE WORSE WORK WHERE WE ARE BIG. ON OUR OWN BUT WE'RE ALSO. NATIONAL AND GLOBAL. SO WE'RE TAKING NATIONAL AND GLOBAL ECONOMIC DATA INDICATORS AND- BRING THAT INTO OUR MODEL WITHOUT REVENUE FOR CASTING TEAMS SO WHAT WILL- PROPOSAL. FOR CHEAP. HE ON A DESTINED FOR MAYES. PROJECTIONS ON HOW HE EXPECTS RENDON YEARS AND NOT PROPER STATE ECONOMY TO GO. SHOULD IT HAPPEN THAT AFTER MAY FOURTEENTH IN JUNE AND JULY AND AUGUST WE HAVE. NO INFORMATION- THAT MAY REQUIRE ADDITIONAL ASSISTANCE TO THE BUDGET IT'S- POSSIBLE THAT THOSE ADJUSTMENTS CAN HAPPEN NUMBER AS JUST. THANK YOU. FOR MUCH OF THE FOR THING ON SAID JUST LIKE ECHO THE- OF THE VICE DON WOULD MISTER IS. YOU KNOW.

WITH THE TEAM AND WITH STEAM OUT- TO ENSURE THAT OUR SUPPLY CHAIN IN THIS PARTICULAR ENDEAVOR REMAINS- YOU KNOW WHAT WE EXPECT AND THEN THE SECOND PART OF THE QUESTION- WE CURRENTLY DO BACK TO THE TIME FRAMES THAT BEEN MADE. OUR OF THE CAR. ONE KEY THING I. IMPORTANT TO KNOW HOW. IS THE- OF THE MASS. ARE THAT THEY MEET THE CDC DIE OFSHE STANDARDS OF FOUR FOUR AROUND ACTUALLY. AND THAT'S THAT IS A REQUIREMENT THAT.

UGH OBTAINED DATA THAT WALL ALLOW US TO START. HE SOME OF THE STAYED HOME RESTRICT OF SOME. THE OF A LACK OF TESTING KITS WHICH IS I THINK THE ADDRESS FIRST AND BEING CHEN UP BUT AS AS WE SEE IS A- BY THE FACT AS WAS OR THAT ARE SHORTAGES OF SWABS AND TO AND OTHER MATERIAL THAT ARE NECESSARY TO. COMPLETE THE TESTS. AB THEN WE HAVE A AND IN SEROLOGY- TESTING OF WHICH HAS YET TO BE PROVEN- AND- SO IN THE NEAR TERM- THAT'S NOT REALLY AVAILABLE TO US ON ALL A LARGE SCALE BASIS EITHER. OF THE ONE THING THAT HAVE BEEN DISCUSSED AS CONTACT TRACING WHICH IS OLD SCHOOL- TECHNOLOGY IF YOU WILL. UP TO SIX. THAT IT IS SAID IN. THE NUMBER OF WHO WILL BE OUT IN THE FIELD OF MAKING CONTACT. WITH PEOPLE WHO OF I HAVE FOR A COOK NINETEEN AND- FOLLOWING UP WITH THOSE PEOPLE TO SEE WHO THEY BEEN IN CONTACT WITH- THIS IS HOW PANDEMICS IN THE PAST HAVE BEEN ADDRESSED IT'S A- OF. A KNOWN TO WORK AND SO MY QUESTION NAG A IS ARE WE CONSIDERING FUNDING- EFFORTS. OF CALIFORNIA THAT WILL. AT LEAST GIVE US A START NOW OPEN. THANK YOU AT SOME MEMBER IS MY MAKE SURE THE CALIFORNIA HELPING HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY ON THE TEST COMPONENT WE ARE ACTIVELY WORKING ON INCREASING OUR TESTING AFTER THE PROCESS STATE I AM IN AREAS. I WHAT I WILL CALL WE TESTING IN THE SAN THAT WE- HAVE PROTESTED CAPABILITIES OUT WE KNOW. SINGLE DAY WERE IN OUR TESTING OF BALK WITHIN OUR HEALTH CARE DELIVERY SAID. WELL SET ASIDE OF HEALTH CARE RECESSED. BUT WE HAVE A LOT MORE WORK AHEAD OF US TO CHIEF THAT I IN TERMS OF YOUR SECOND CUP AROUND KIND TRACY YORK THAT A PUBLIC HEALTH AT THAT IS YOU QUITE FREE. IT IS ACTUALLY COMMON ONE I'M THINKING SLASH CASH REGULAR BECAUSE FOR EXAMPLE WHERE WE ACT CON THE INTO WHO IT INFECTED AND MAKE SURE WE ARE ALSO AT THE WHO MIGHT BE EXPOSED TO THAT INDIVIDUAL I MONITOR THEM FOR SYMPTOMS THEY CAN BE A. THE GOVERNOR ASKED WILL ISSUE TO ASK. DECATUR'S LOOKING AT HOW YOU MODIFY THE NON PHARMACEUTICAL IN. SO WE HAVE INTO TODAY. AS OF THAT IN IN ONE WE OUT PLAN TO MAP. OUR EFFORTS CON TRACY SO THE GUY AND THE- HAVE COMMITTED PROVIDING I JUST THE GENERAL. WITH WEEKLY UP. ON THAT. AND SO WE LOOK FOR GAUGING THAT AND BRING WITH. AVAILABLE TO ACTUALLY DO THAT WORK THERE ARE MANY MANY QUALIFIED TO- INDIVIDUALS OUT THERE WHO ARE NOT WORKING OUT OF THE WORKFORCE IS CERTAINLY THERE THAT WE COULD. CALL UPON COMMENTED. OF THE- TERRIBLE CRISIS THAT WE'VE HAD TO- IN- OF PP AND- AND OTHER EQUIPMENT- IT'S QUITE CLEAR THAT WE HAVE ISSUES THAT WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH IN THE FUTURE AROUND PROCUREMENT AND TO. PROVIDING A SECURE SUPPLY CHAIN OF AND I THINK- BECAUSE OF. IN IN THE FUTURE WE SHOULD BE TALKING BOUT OF A DISCRETE FUNDING SOURCE SO THAT WE KNOW OF THAT THE FUNDING IS THERE WHO OP MINUTE LEE- CREATE A SYSTEM WHERE WE DON'T HAVE THIS KIND OF- IN THE FUTURE TO IT'S QUITE DISTURBING I THINK FOR EVERYONE. JUST YOUR OFF ON THE TREE AND THIS IS THE WORLD. THAT THE- OUR THINGS THAT ARE VERY TO RISK TO THIS DOWN WERE SIMPLY NOT OF IN THE NECESSARY QUANTITIES AND SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE DEFINITELY NEED TO WORK ON. THE ADDRESS CREATED A BUSINESS TASK OF HOW WHICH I'D YEAH GENERALLY THINK IS A THING OF BUT IVORY SOME A NO OF CONCERN AND MY COMMUNITY THEY MIGHT BE REFLECTED ELSEWHERE IN THE STATE AS WELL THAT SMALL BUSINESS NOT REALLY WERE LIKE THAT IN THAT. IN A. I TWO FIVE GREAT CAUSE TO EVERY IN THE STATE THAT SMALL THE- ROLE IN THE STATE OF. INSTEAD OF COLLAPSED AND THE NEW TO BE PART OF THE- ABOUT HOW BRING THE A CON BACK. ON BECAUSE ECONOMY COMES BY. CALIFORNIA AND ON. YEAH MISTER WILL I CAN CERTAINLY SAY FOR THE ADMIN I KNOW IT'S EASIEST IN THE HEARINGS SAY THE EVERYTHING A TALK BUT FROM DIRECT CON THAT WE'VE ALL WITH THE GOVERNOR THE SENIOR TEAM OUT SMALL BUSINESS BOTH IN TERMS FIXING THE P. FOR AND THAT THE FEDERAL BUT ALSO HELPING THE SMALL BUSINESSES IN THE STATE REALLY IS A TOP NUMBER FOR THE MANY BUT IT WILL. ASK FORCE I HAVE THAT THE LIST AT. NUMBER IN FRONT OF ME SO WE'D LIKE TO DEFINITELY AT BRING AT FEEDBACK THAT YOU HAVE SEX IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW WHO THEY NEED MAKE SURE THAT THEY REACH OUT. TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL CRISP ARE. RIGHT BUT MAKING SURE THAT SMALL. GET THE HELP THEY NEED OUT WILL BE A CRIME AVERAGE ON THAT TIME FORCE WHICH THE OF FINE. AND THE GOVERNOR OFFICE OF BUSINESS ECONOMICS WILL BE THERE CLOSELY WEST I BELIEVE THAT THERE. PLAN IS PUT OUT ABOUT. TERM I RECOMMEND. OVER THE NEXT A AS WELL. TIONS AND THAT. BROUGHT. THE STORE- LEVELS OF UNEMPLOYMENT TO THAT WE'RE EXPERIENCING IN THE STATE RIGHT NOW- AND THAT'S MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR MANY PEOPLE. TO MAKE THE RENT PAYMENT AND THAT TURNED AYE IS AFFECTING- MANY LANDLORDS AROUND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. ARE THERE ANY PLANS IN THE WORKS FOR- A STATEWIDE RENTAL ASSISTANCE THAT WOULD HELP TO ALLEVIATE THAT PROBLEM. SO ON THIS YEAR THAT THE RENT THAT RENDON RIGHT TO SYSTEMS DEFINITELY THE ADMINISTRATION IS VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE PRESSURES ON BOTH ON RENTERS AS WELL AS THE BROADER PRESSURES IN THE HOUSING MARKET AND THAT WAS A KEY DRIVER BEHIND THE DECISION WITH. RENTAL PAINTINGS I GOT THEIR- EXECUTIVE ORDER A COUPLE WEEKS AGO. I PERSONALLY CAN LOOK AT THESE AND NEIGHBORHOOD. ON TO PICK OF THE CONSTRAINTS THAT WE FACED WITH OUR BUDGET AND OUR BALANCED BUDGET REQUIREMENTS WE REALLY ARE LEANING ON THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AS MUCH AS WE CAN. TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL ASSISTANCE THERE WAS SOME HOUSING ASSISTANCE IN THE ACT WE NEED DEVELOPMENT BLOCK GRANT AND THEN ALSO I KNOW NOT DIRECTLY ON YOUR QUESTION. WHEN pASSISTANCE THROUGH THE EMERGENCY SOLUTIONS PROGRAMS BUT THE GOVERNOR. SAID ASK FROM THE SENATE BUT AS WELL UNLESS STEP POPPING RENTAL ASSISTANCE WILL BE HOPING AND NOT JUST SOMETHING THAT CAN FOR. THE FEDERAL. WE WILL ALL. PEOPLE AT WHAT WE DO YOU WITH REGARD TO THE BUDGET OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL ALSO TURNING OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE CHRIS AND WHO NAY ABLE TO WRITE ADDITIONAL. A THIS IS BECAUSE- I'M IN TURN OF THANK. COMPONENTS OF STATE. IN ADDITION TO THOSE THAT MY COLLEAGUE MENTIONED. THERE IS EIGHT TENANTS BASED RESIDENT AT RENTAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM AND FOR PUBLIC HOUSING AUTHORITIES WHICH SHOULD. BE ABOUT A HUNDRED AND SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS IN CALIFORNIA AND THEN ANOTHER. AND RELATED TO PUBLIC HOUSING AUTHORITIES JUST TO HELP THEM MAINTAIN OPERATIONS DURING THE PANDEMIC I KNOW IT IT IS NOT WIDESPREAD- BUT IT THERE IS SOME RELIEF AND CERTAIN AREAS. THANK YOU. THAT CONCLUDES MY QUESTIONS AND REMARKS THANK YOU MISTER THANK MATHEMATICS DOCTOR WOULD HAVE ONE FOLLOW UP QUESTION ON TESTING YES THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND ACTUALLY WANT TO THANK MISTER BLOOM FOR RIVER JOGGING MY MEMORY ON THIS MY CONCERN- AROUND TESTING- IS THAT I HAVE- ONE COUNTY THAT HAS NOT HAD A CASE I HAVE ONE COUNTY THAT HAS NO ACTIVE CASES BUT HAS HAD CASES- ANOTHER COUNTIES HAD TWO CASES AND THEN A COUPLE COUNTY SAID. QUITE A BIT MORE- THE END AND THOSE COUNTY THAT HAVEN'T HAD CASES OR OR HAVE HAD MINIMAL CASES IT ACTIVE CASES ARE VERY CAN ABOUT THE TESTING PART OF THIS AND THAT THE RESOURCE WILL GO HOT SYNOPSIS WAY TO IN THE REASON DIFFERENT. THE ARE SMALL TOWN IS. ZERO UNDER OR STEP YES. SIR THE POTENTIAL IS IF HAVE TESTING AND CONTEST COPE IN TEST A PERSON WHO'S A WOULD. SHOWING SYMPTOMS AND THE AND THE A PA RESULT THEY THE ABILITY TO TRACE BECAUSE THERE AREN'T AS MANY CASES IN THE COUNTY- THE COUNTIES ARE MUCH SMALLER. AND THERE THERE IS A CHANCE THAT YOU COULD STOP AN OUTBREAK- BUT IF THEY HAVE THE TESTING. A CODE. TO DO THAT- THE IMPLICATIONS OF THAT IN A SMALLER COUNTY THAT HAVE LESS FOR PURPOSES. BE SIGNIFICANT AND SO THAT BENEFIT. PART THAT I AM. I DIDN'T WHAT CAN I TELL MY SMALLER COUNTIES IS SAY THAT THEY WOULD LIKE TO HAVE SOME TESTING OF CAPACITY TO PREVENT AN OUTBREAK- NOT NECESSARILY- THEN THE WAY THEY'RE GETTING IT NOW. DOCTOR WITH THIS IS MARK ON EACH WITH THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCIES SO RIGHT NOW WE'VE HAD TO. PRIORITIZE WHERE WE ARE. TESTING AND WHO WE ARE TESTING- HOWEVER THE TESTING TASK FORCE HAS A VERY CLEAR- DIRECTOR FOR BOTH THE GOVERNOR AND THE SECRETARY THE HEALTHY. THIS IS AGING. AND THAT IS TO BE PASSED. THE STATE SO THAT WORKING TO WE'RE DOING ACTIVE UNITY. WORKING BROAD BASED CAN. THING AND. ANDRES IN TERMS OF RURAL VERSUS URBAN WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE GET TESTING CAPACITIES ACROSS THE STATE. INCLUDES RURAL AREAS OF THE STATE ESPECIALLY WITH REGARDS TO CONTACT TRACING YOU RECOGNIZE THAT WE CAN'T DO CONTRACT RACING WITH THE WORK FORCE THAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE IN THE PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE. AND SO WE ARE HAVING CONGRESS CHANGED. FORWARD PARTNER WITH YOU AND ARE. AROUND FIGURE OUT WHAT EVENTUALLY LEFT WHICH I IN ORDER TO HAVE THAT CAPACITY. I GUESS MY POINT IS IN SOME KEY THE PROBABLY COULD HAVE TO COME TO DO THAT CA TRACING IF THEY HAVE ABILITY TASK AND SO WITHOUT IT- YOU CAN'T AND SO- THAT'S THAT'S MY CONCERN. BUT THERE ABOUT THAT THE FORCE'S WORK ON IT AND- I HOPE THAT IF WE DO GET THAT HAPPENED THAT. AND I HAVE I WAS ON A CALL WAS SIX PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICERS LAST WEEK AND THE NUMBER ONE AND REMEMBER THESE ARE ALL DIFFERENT SIZE COUNTIES. THE NUMBER ONE THING THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT WAS A NUMBER ONE WAS TESS. NUMBER TWO. SO THANK YOU. THANK DOCTOR WHAT I WAS FOR AN GET TO MY QUESTIONS AND SO ON. IN A SO THIS MISTER BLOOM WASN'T THE ONLY ONE BETWEEN EVERYBODY LINE SO I DON'T HAVE SO JUST GO BACK TO TESTING FOR A- SECOND I I'M JUST GOAL IS ABOUT TWENTY FIVE TASADAY BY MAY FIRST DO WE- ARE WE ON OUR MARKET TO ME THAT GOAL IN THE- IN ORDER.

IN A DAY WHERE ACTIVELY NUMBER OF DIFFERENT SALUTE WERE NOT TO POINT TO JUST WANT TO FROM THE MORE DOWN IN ORDER FOR US TO A BY WE ARE A TRACK TO TWENTY FIVE TO TEST BY THE END OF THE MONTH NO NO YOU FOR THE BUT HOW MANY WE NEED TO UP TO DO THE BROAD TEST YOUR TO BRING TO. WHAT THIS CITY ACROSS THE STATE AND WHAT THE LIMITING OUR SO IT JUST BE TO TASK SOME IN WE HAVE THE ABILITY TASK WHAT THE LIMITING FACTOR A IS THE BILL TO COLLECT THE SPACE SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I LIEU TO OUR TODAY WAS THE NO THAT WE ISSUE THE CHAIN RICK SWAPS OR MEDIA OKAY. WE DO A LOT TESTING. BUT WE'RE HAPPY I'M JUST WITH REGARDS TO GETTING WE CAN ACTUALLY COLLECT THIS. WE'RE LOOKING NOW IS BOTH OF THOSE COME. TO SEE HOW HOW DO YOU PLAY IN THE THERE IF THERE IN THE THAT GOVERNOR HAS MAPPED OUT WITH RICK TO THE MODEST. OF THE- CLICK ON THIS GOING TO ASK THE QUESTION FOR THE THIRD TIME SO YOU HAVE A FULL OF TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND ON MAY FIRST. WHAT IS THE NUMBER WE NEED TO REACH. I WAS LOOKING FOR I DON'T I DON'T I DON'T HAVE A EXACT OF THOSE ANY RIGHT A HUNDRED JUST I DON'T AN EGG NUMBER PART OF THE CHANNEL IS GOING BE THIS CHAIN. I YOU HAVE A MANY TESTS AS POSSIBLE WE CAN'T AND I YOU CAN HAVE A TEST EVERYTHING CAL. BUT IF YOU HAVE ISSUE WITH THREE TO HOW YOU COLLECT SOME AND THEIR PROBLEM THREE TO THE- PASSED IN SO WE ARE NOT TO RE TWO ISSUES ONE. NO AGAINST SEMANTIC OF THE THIS BECAUSE STAYING YES LET'S JUST THE WHOLE TESTING PROCESS SO LET'S NOT GET STUCK WITH. IN YOU'RE GOING THE FIVE THOUSAND TODAY MY- WHAT NUMBER NEED TO. ORDER MORE NORMAL IS AT A HUNDRED IS A FIFTY IS IT LIKE A MAN BUT WHAT WHAT IS IT. WHERE ASSESSING THAT RIGHT NOW I DON'T HAVE THE NUMBER FOR. WHEN DO YOU THINK WOULD HAVE A NUMBER. I WAS.

FREE TESTING FOR EVERYONE DO YOU GIVE CENTS ON THEY'RE ABLE TO DO IT SAID THESE TWO IN THAT THE PROBABLY MORE I JUST IT I KNOW WHAT AT. THE BILL WHAT OTHER. CANNOT HAVE THEY BEEN ABLE TO AT THE SWAMP AND THAT AND THE REASON THAT YOU REFERRED TO IN OTHER AREAS HAVE. HI SO AT YOUR IS. RIGHT THERE A PAST CITY WITH REGARD TO THE NET OF FRIENDS THAT MIGHT BE AVAIL IN OUR LA MY BE THERE THAN IN MY BE ANOTHER. WE DON'T WE DON'T SEE TO THAT WE AT LEAST NOT RIGHT I'M NOT GOING BUT AN ISSUE REGARDS TO THE RE. THE THING THAT I WAS TO IS THE BY MEET WHICH THAT PIECE OF LUCK WITH THAT SPECIMENS PUT INTO AND WE ARE ACTIVELY WORKING ON ACTUALLY PRODUCING THAT ARE. THEN THIS. THAT CAN. HI JIM THIS YEAR THE DEEP SENSE OF WHY ORGAN CAN TO FOR EVERYBODY SAVE MY SAN FRANCISCO CAN'T. I THINK THAT'S A TO THE LOCAL. THAT WEREN'T DICTATE AT THIS LEVEL DOES WHAT AND WE ARE LOOKING TO WITH THOSE JR. BUT REMEMBER THE IT'S NOT JUST IN PUBLIC SECTOR WERE DOING TESTING WELL DOING A LOT OF PRIVATE SECTOR TEST AND HOW THE PRIVATE SECTOR ENTITIES DECIDE TO TEST AND WHERE TO TEST THAT IS UP M. BASED ON DEMAND. WHOLE LOT OKAY SO COLLABORATION PRIVATE ENTITY PUBLIC AND- THAT IS GOING TO BE THE DECISION OF THE LEVEL ASKED TO THEY PRY. THAT IS A LOW GEN I CAN THAT EIGHT BY I. FIVE TEN DAY ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT JUST STAY TEST THAT'S CAL TESTS ALL FOR ACCOUNT I'M SORRY. TO FOR. IN PUBLIC SECTOR HOW. HOW MUCH INFORMATION ARE YOU GETTING REAL TIME SO THAT YOU CAN GET A SENSE OF- JUST BECAUSE BASED ON. THIS DIALOGUE DOESN'T SEEM LIKE YOU HAVE A REALLY GOOD UNDERSTANDING WHAT'S HAPPENING LA WHICH IS THE- JUST COUNTY IN THE STATE VERSUS SAY. THE OTHER COUNTIES AND IN ON THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE. SO WHAT WE KNOW IS- WE HAVE VERY GOOD DATA COMING IN FROM ALL PROPER TERRY SPEAKING AT NO THEIR MANDATE. TO REPORT WITH REGARDS TO ALL TASKS THAT ARE POSITIVE- WE HAVE NOW REQUIRED THAT ALL LABORATORIES COMMERCIAL AND- PUBLIC REPORT NEGATIVES AS WELL THE PACE AT WHICH WE ARE GETTING THE NAME OF REPORTS. I NEED TO COUNTY AND WE- GEN BUT WE ARE COLLECTING AT AS MANDATED AT THAT LOCAL LABORATORIES BOTH PUBLIC AND PRIVATE REPORT BOTH POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE TESTS THAT THEY DO IN EACH FLAPPER. DO YOU DO IS. TIME YOU GET A REAL TIME DATA IN TERMS OF WHO'S ADMINISTERING TASS SO BASED ON THAT YOU HAVE A SENSE OF THE NUMBER OF TEST THEY'RE BEING. DONE YEAH I ASSUME. GETTING DOUBT THOSE FIGURES AT THE COUNTY LEVEL OR YOU GET GREATER GRANULARITY THAN THAT. I IT IS AT THE COUNTY LEVEL- IF YOU ACTUALLY VISIT OUR WEBSITE AT C. H. E. JEFF AT CA DOC UP EVERY DAY WE POST A NUMBER OF PROTESTS THAT ARE. ACROSS THE STATE GOT IT. WHAT WERE YOU DO REAL. YOU'RE NOT NECESSARILY. YOU DON'T HAVE A SENSE PACIFIC LEE WHAT THE OVERALL CAPACITY AS- WE GET WHAT WHAT WE HAVE A SENSE OF THIS HOW MANY TESTS WERE ACTUALLY DONE WHAT WE'RE WORKING ON RIGHT NOW. THE REASON WHY I CANNOT. ANSWER YOUR QUESTION IS WE'RE REACHING OUT TO EACH ONE OF THESE INSTITUTIONS TO SAY IN ADDITION TO WHAT YOU SAID RIGHT NOW HOW MUCH ARE CAN YOU. AND WHAT ARE THE LESS LIMITING FACTORS AS TO YOU NOT TEST IT'S A- CITY THAT WE'RE TRYING TO UNDERSTAND. MOMENT AND THE TWENTY FIVE TO TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND THE TESTS. THAT INCLUDES TESTS AWAITING A RESULT OR THAT'S JUST THE ONES THAT HAVE RESULT. WE'RE LOOKING TO DELIVER TWENTY TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO TEST TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND SPECIMENS PER DAY THAT'S THE THAT'S THE GOAL THAT THAT AT THE TASK FORCE HAS PUT FORWARD. GONNA SO THAT MEANS THAT THE TWENTY DOLLAR BILLS ARE RESULTS SO THAT'S A POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE. I'M SORRY CORRECT. JUST GOING BACK ARE JUST WANTED TO ASK QUESTIONS AROUND THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE BUDGET COMMITTEE LETTER WHICH WAS- LAST I THINK IT WAS LAST WEEK OR THE WEEK BEFORE THESE THESE WEEKS TOUGH START TO BLEND TOGETHER SO I APOLOGIZE FOR THE- FROM FORGET. AS PART OF THE LETTER WE HAD PASSED TO TRACK SUPPLY AND DEMAND A P. P. ACROSS THE STATE WE HAD ASKED FOR WHICH MAJOR TYPE OF EQUIPMENT AND DESTINATION EACH OUTGOING SHIP INTENT FOR THOSE TO BE TAKEN UP IN CAP SPACE COUNTY OR ZIP USER. INCLUDE OFFICER ISN'T UP. TO WORK TIME PARAPHRASING THE LETTER ALSO THE OF ORDER FILL BY COUNTY OR HEALTH CARE. THE POWER ORDER FOR DISTURBING WITHIN THESE JURISDICTION AND FOR ALL OF THAT TO BE. UP PUBLISHED ON OUR WEBSITE NOW- SHE THE- THAT THE COUNTY SPREAD SHEET THAT WE GOT SHOWING IN INETY FIVE RESPIRATORS AND SURGICAL MASKS- DID GIVE A SENSE ALL WHEN THAT INFORMATION CAN BE. PUBLISHED ONLINE I THINK A LOT OF. REQUEST A WEEK AT OUR FROM LOCAL OFFICIALS LOOKING AGAIN FOR INFORMATION I THINK MY COLLEAGUES HAVE ALL ECHO THAT IT WOULD BE GREAT IF SOME OF THIS INFORMATION COULD BE COULD BE BLIND REAL TIME LOOKS LIKE SOME OF THE DATA YOU FOR YOU. MENTION ALREADY TALKED ABOUT. YEAH THANKS FOR THE QUESTION. MISTER CHAIR WE ARE WORKING ON NOT- EXPANDING OUR- OUR DASHBOARD- AND THE INFORMATION THAT WE- WILL BE ABLE TO PUT UP ONLINE AND SO WE'RE HOPING TO. GET THAT COMPLETED OUR PRIORITY QUITE FRANKLY HAS BEEN ON GETTING THE PP WERE ACTUALLY RESPONDING TO THE EVENT AND SO MOST OF THE- EFFORTS OF THE CRUISER AND WORKING. I'M HAVE BEEN- TO BE ABLE TO AT LEAST OF FOCUS ON- ADJUDICATING WHY RESOURCES WE HAVE AND- TRY TO PUSH THOSE OUT AS AS FAST AS POSSIBLE. BUT WE HAVE BEEN WORKING ON THE DASHBOARD AND WE HOPE TO HAVE A COMPLETE HERE% ALL WITHIN A WEEK. OKAY BYE WEEK IT WILL BE ABLE TO GET SOMETHING ON A LINE. THAT'S GREAT AND DO YOU THINK YOU'LL BE ABLE TO PROVIDE INFORMATION THAT. EIGHTY RIVER QUESTION. ALL TO GO BACK AND LOOK AT THE LETTER AGAIN AND THERE ARE. MANY THINGSTHAT ARE ON THERE WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO- PROVIDE DAD AND I TRY TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE ARE NOT. SENSITIVE OR- A CRITICAL ISSUES ON THERE THAT WE CAN'T PROVIDE FOR OPERATIONAL REASONS NOT THAT'S FINE AND I THINK. YEAH I THINK FOR IN THIS THIS IS JUST TO SORT OF ECHO WHAT THE SENATE COMMITTEE SAID I THINK FOR ISSUES THAT ARE SENSITIVE WE ALL UNDERSTAND. THERE ARE SOME ISSUES THAT ARE SENSITIVE- MY SUGGESTION IT WOULD BE. GOOD TO HAVE A SEPARATE LEGISLATIVE BRIEFING ON ISSUES THAT ARE. PARTICULAR SENSE HERE THAT HAVE PARTICULAR SENSITIVITY. I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT FOR US TO AT LEAST GET BRIEFED ON THOSE ISSUES EVEN IF YOU CAN'T. COMPLETELY SURE THOSE WITH THE PUBLIC- SO WE WOULD BE GREAT TO ACTUALLY SET UP SOME SORT OF PROCESS TO THAT THAT- THAT THAT CAN OCCUR. I KNOW THAT THERE'S THESE DAILY ALL WE ASK CALLS THERE BUT THEY'RE ONLY ONE HOUR. AND OFTEN TIMES- YOU KNOW QUESTION I'M MORE SENSITIVE. I CAN'T BE HONEST AND SOMETIMES YOU KNOW QUESTION IS JUST WE GET TO THE QUESTIONS BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE ON THE CALL. BUT HOPE THERE'S A- YOU AGAIN. IN GETTING THE REST. THIS IS SORT OF THAT'S- AND- MAYBE I'M JUST OVERLY SENSITIVE BUT AGAIN IT JUST SEEMS THAT- IT WOULD BE IMPORTANT FOR US TO. BE ABLE TO HAVE A FULL BRIEFING ON. ALL THOSE ISSUES ARE SENSITIVE AND CAN'T BE RELEASED TO THE PUBLIC. THANK YOU ALL I WILL TAKE THAT BACK AND SEE IF WE CAN. WE CAN NOW WILL GET BACK ON THAT. ON IT AND JUST JUST GOING BACK TO- THE MODEL FOR A SECOND I KNOW THAT WE TOUCHED ON A LITTLE BIT BUT- BUT AGAIN. THE MODEL I GUESS. WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER THAN THE MODEL SHOWS A MID MAY PEAK I KNOW THAT SAY I THINK IT'S THE UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON MODEL BECAUSE THAT'S ONE OF THE MODELS THAT ONLINE. SHOWS A MID APRIL P. D. DO YOU KNOW WHO ANY. UNDERSTANDING THE DIFFERENCE. SURE THAT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN FOR THAT QUESTION AND THE JOHN TOP GUN MODEL IS ALSO AVAILABLE ONLINE AND OPEN TO THE PUBLIC AT THE DIFFERENCE AND IN US COMING CONVERSATIONS WITH OUR COUNTERPARTS ANOTHER STATE. IS THAT THE- THAT THE ASSUMPTIONS ARE BEING USED IN THE UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON MODEL ARE CHANGING ARE ON THE BACK AND QUITE FREQUENTLY. I AND- THEY ARE RATHER CONSERVATIVE COMPARED TO SOME OF THE OTHER MODELS- AND SO- WHAT WE ARE LOOKING AT IS NOT JUST ONE MODEL OF A MULTIPLE MODELS SO WE START THERE KEEPING A CLOSE EYE AYE OUT ON THEIR- AYE HME MODEL THAT IS BEING PRODUCED BY THE UNIVERSE. WASHINGTON THE UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA MODEL. OUT NOW TO MY- JOHN CAN THE MODEL WE ARE ALSO WERE. UNIVERSITY IT TO OUR PRODUCING A MODEL. THE IDEA HERE IS DIRECTIONALITY- ARE AWARE HOW ARE WE SEEING THE DIRECTIONALITY OF THE VIRUS WITHIN IN ANY PARTICULAR STATE AND- WHAT WE LIKED ABOUT THE JOHNS HOPKINS MODEL IS THE ABILITY TO PROVIDE COUNTY LEVEL DATA THAT THE OTHER MODELS WERE NOT ABLE TO DO. SOME OF THEM ARE BEGINNING TO DO THAT BUT THAT WHAT REALLY REALLY LIKED ABOUT THE JOHNS HOPKINS MODEL YEAH THAT'S GREAT IF YOU COULD SHARE THE LINK FOR THE HOPKINS MODEL THAT THE- GRAY AYE. ALWAYS FIND IT THE THROUGH THEIR WEBSITE. I'M NOT HERE I JUST DON'T COME BACK QUESTION AROUND CONSTRUED MUSIC CONSERVATIVE WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU MEAN THAT. IT'S BECAUSE- INSTEAD. PREDICT LESS INTER. SO BIG OF THAT THE CANCER. RIGHT OKAY GREAT- AND THEN JUST GOING BACK TO FINANCE ARE REGARDING SOME OF THE EXPENDITURES- WE KNOW THAT- MISS CALVERT PROVIDED THE EXPENDITURES FOR APPROXIMATELY THE- I GUESS PARKS MY FOR. TWO BILLION DOLLARS HERE THERE'S ANOTHER FIVE BILLION THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT. SPENDING CAN YOU GIVE US A SENSE OF WHAT. WHAT THAT IS WITH WITH THE MAJOR MARKETS ARE AND WE CAN GET A BREAK OUT. LATER TO BUT JUST TO GET A ROUGH SENSE. WILL I TURN IT OVER IT'S ACTUALLY SIX HOUR TO DISCUSS THAT I SHOULD SAY THAT SHE WILL SHE CAN DEFINITELY TALK ABOUT MAJOR BUCKETS AND HOW WORKING CATEGORIES WHEN IT COMES TO ACTUAL ALLOCATIONS- THESE ARE VERY ANSWER YOU CAN DISCUSS HOW WE ARE. GREAT. THREE SIX OVER IT AGAIN- SO TO VERY HIGH LEVEL OF ANY OF THE USED TO SECURE PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT AND CRITICAL THAT. I AM ALL THEIR BE VARIOUS HOSPITAL MEDICAL SEARCH. AND ACTIVITIES SO I'M STAFF BEING TOTALLY SAYS- AS AN EXAMPLE AND THE HOTELS FOR HEALTH CARE WORKERS AND- WHAT STEP THAT CANNOT GO HOME ITSELF ISOLATOR INCLUDED AND THERE'S A RANGE OF SUPPORT SERVICES NUMBER OF WHICH WE TALKED. ABOUT AS FAR AS BEING. ROLES ARE SIX BASIC ALEX SO THOSE ARE THAT THE HIGH LEVEL CATEGORIES. THAT ARE. INCOME IN THE LARGER AND SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS. EACH ESTIMATES. SO YOU HAD P. P. HOSPITAL AND MEDICAL SEARCH. HOTELS IN SUPPORT SERVICES WITH THE WHAT DO I'M SORRY APPLY MISTER CATEGORY OR TO. NO I THINK THAT CAPTURED THOSE- CORRECTLY SO SUPPORT SERVICES IS. INCLUDES THAT- HOMELESS SERVICES ALLOCATIONS A FEW BEEN SUPPORTS- THAT CHILD CARE SERVICES OF COURSE WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER- AS WELL AS SOME OF THE- SECTION THIRTY SIX PUBLICATIONS. SO SINCE THERE'S ABOUT ROUGHLY FIVE BILLION MORE THAT HASN'T BEEN- BROKEN OUT ROUGHLY WHAT ARE YOU ANTICIPATING SPENDING ON PPV VERSUS. HOTELS SUPPORT SERVICES HOMELESS AND CHILD CARE SERVICES. RIGHT AT THIS TIME WE DON'T HAVE A BREAK OUT TO PROVIDE YOU- AT THIS NUMBER AGAIN. TALKING ABOUT THE BROAD CATEGORIES BUT WE DON'T HAVE A BREAKOUT AVAILABLE TO SHARE. THAT'S BECAUSE YOU HAVEN'T THAT JUST- ESTIMATE OF WHAT YOU ANTICIPATE OR- YOU YOU HAVEN'T NAILED DOWN THOSE EXPENDITURES AT. RIGHT SO I THINK IT AND IT IS AGAIN YEAH OUR PRELIMINARY CASH FLOW ESTIMATE- AND THINGS ARE- CHANGE AND THINGS HAVE BEEN CHANGING SO WE ARE. TRACKING THESE CATEGORIES AND AGAIN DON'T HAVE A BREAK OUT AT THE TIME AT THIS TIME. YEAH I THINK JUST TO ECHO WHAT MICHAEL MARK I'M ALMOST ALL MY COLLEAGUES HAVE. SAID IN IN TOWN. I THINK WHERE YOU KNOW WHERE WE'RE OBVIOUSLY EXTRAORDINARILY SUPPORTIVE OF THE GOVERNOR AND THE ADMINISTRATION EVERYTHING THAT'S BEEN DONE TO. REALLY MANAGE THIS DEMOCRATS BASS AS POSSIBLE HERE IN CALIFORNIA- HAVING SAID THAT THE YOU KNOW THE EMERGENCY POWERS- THAT WERE GRANTED. YOU KNOW WITH AN UNDERSTANDING THAT THIS WOULD BE FOR A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF- DISCRETE TIME- DEFINITELY WASN'T THE SENSE THAT THERE WAS A BLANK CHECK OR THAT WE WOULD JUST BE- JUST- NOTIFIED AFTER EXPENDITURES WERE ALREADY COMMITTED TO SO I THINK THE HOPE IS. NOT WE HAVE GONE THROUGH A ROUGH INITIAL FIVE WEEKS AND OBVIOUSLY THERE'S STILL MORE TO BE. DONE BUT THAT WILL BE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE DISCUSSION BACK AND FORTH ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO THE- EXPENDITURE OF RESOURCES ESPECIALLY AS IT HAS AN IMPACT- GOING INTO NEXT YEAR'S BUDGET AS WELL AS- AN ONGOING BUDGETS. THIS IS NOT THIS IS A RESERVE ANY. OF POLY WE'VE ALL. VERY VERY TO BUILD YOU KNOW WE I WAS THERE ON THE GROUND FLOOR AS WE STARTED BUILDING THIS SERVICE AND I THINK WE- WANT TO HAVE A SAY IN TO HOW. THIS RESERVE MONEY IS BEINGSPENT- WE OBVIOUSLY KNOW THAT RIGHT NOW WE HAVE A CRISIS- WE HAVE FULL FAITH AND- DUTY OF THE GOVERNOR TO REALLY GET US THROUGH THIS CRIME BUT HOW DOES THAT I THINK WE ALSO. FEEL LIKE WE HAVE A VERY IMPORTANT ROLE TO PLAY ESPECIALLY AS IT COMES TO THE APPROPRIATION AND THE EXPENDITURE OF THESE RESOURCES SO THEN. JUST GOING BACK TO THE OTHER FIVE BILLION WIND WIND WE ANTICIPATE GETTING MORE INFORMATION ON THIS. SO I THINK I CAN SAY ARE. YOU EAT EVEN IN THE NEXT COUPLE WEEKS I DON'T THINK THAT THERE WILL BE A FULL PLAN FOR COMMUNICATIONS OF THE EXACT FIVE BILLION IN PART BECAUSE THAT FIVE BILLION. TAKER MAY CHANGE BUT CERTAINLY THAT YOU CAN EXPECT THAT AS PART OF THE NAME PROVISIONS. BUDGET PROCESS YOU KNOW WE'RE PRESENTING OUR FISCAL PLAN ABOUT PROPOSAL FOR THE UPCOMING YEAR FOR YOU OUR CONSIDERATION- THERE SHOULD BE ADDITIONAL DETAIL THERE. THEY WERE YOUNG I THINK THE HOPE. MOVE AWAY FROM JOINT. BUDGET NOW. ARE WE UNDERSTAND THAT YOU MAY NOT KNOW EVERYTHING IN THE FUTURE I THINK THE YOU KNOW EVERY YEAR WE DO A BUDGET AND THE ONLY THING. WE CAN SAY FOR CERTAINTY IS THE BY JUST NOT GONNA BE ONE UNDER PERCENT AFTER WE ALL WE ALL KNOW THAT- BUT- WE AGREE ON A DOCUMENT THAT IS A SET OF SYMBOLS ON THE SIDE OF EXPENDITURES OVER. I THINK IT WOULD BE NICE TO GO BACK THAT ESPECIALLY IN REGARDS TO STICK SPEND THE CHORE OF BILLIONS AND ENDS UP WITH YOU KNOW. TWENTY DOLLARS. SO AGAIN I THINK THAT THAT'S JUST MY A LIFE MY FINAL POINT JUST MAKING SURE THAT AGAIN WE- YOU KNOW WE HAVE A BUDGET PROCESS WE HAVE A BUDGET PROCESS AND HOW WE SPEND MONEY- OBVIOUSLY WE KNOW WERE IN AN EMERGENCY WHERE WE NEED TO EXPAND MONEY QUICKLY BUT ALSO ON HOW THE PROCESS WHERE WE ARE TRYING TO MANAGE OUR EXPENSE. WE ALREADY HOW FINE. WE GET OUR EXPECT WORSE BUDGET NEW HAS YOU KNOW MOVING FORWARD- HIGH I WOULD DEFINITELY CONCUR WITH THAT TO THINK IT'S EVEN MORE REASON FOR US TO BE WORKING TOGETHER- TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU KNOW AS WE MAKE THESE DECISIONS THAT THEIR JOINT DECISIONS NOT JUST ABOUT DECISIONS FROM ONE PARTICULAR PART- SO. LOOKING AROUND TO SEE IF THERE ARE ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS ARE PEOPLE DYING OF HUNGER- YOUKNOW WE ARE WE ARE GOING TO GO TO PUBLIC COMMENT WE HAVE A NUMBER OF PEOPLE ON THE PHONE WE HAVE A FEW BRAVE SOULS HERE IN THE COMMITTEE ROOM- SO WE WILL GO TO PUBLIC COMMENT WE ARE ASKING. A MINUTE EACH I AND I SEE MR LEVEL IN THE AUDIENCE WHO IS YOUR BRAVE. FOR HALF HOURS THIS HEARINGS ON THIS LEVEL. HELLO HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL COACH YOU ONCE TOLD ME THE THING HE LIKED ABOUT ME WAS I WAS TOO STUPID TO BE AFRAID. GOOD FOR YOU I BE REMISS I DIDN'T COMMENT ON THIS COMMITTEE HEARING I'VE BEEN HERE THIRTY FIVE YEARS AND THIS COMMITTEE HEARING WITH EVERYBODY'S QUESTIONS- EXEMPLIFIED THE VERY HIGHEST STANDARDS OF PUBLIC SERVICE EXCELLENCE- WHEN I TALK ABOUT VERY QUICKLY HE IS AN UNMET NEED THAT WE HAVE AND THAT'S THE NEED FOR INTER OPERABILITY SERVICES CONNECTING ALL OF THE HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS THE HOSPITALS. THE HEALTH OFFICERS IN EVERY COUNTY TOGETHER UNDER THE BEST INTEROPERABLE ANY SERVICE IN THE COUNTRY IS IN NEW JERSEY- WHERE THEY HAVE CONNECTED EVERYONE TOGETHER THEY MUNICH. FOR EXAMPLE YOU HAD A HOSPITAL LAID OFF PEAK. DATA MEDIA REPORT SOMEPLACE WHERE THERE WAS NEED- IF YOU NEEDED TO MEET MOVE PATIENTS IT'S A VERY EFFECTIVE- WE DON'T HAVE THAT HERE AND WE NEED TO- IT IS EASY TO INSTALL THE SOFTWARE SETTING UP. THE NEW JERSEY PROGRAM CAN BE SET UP IN EVERY HOSPITAL IN THE STATE IN LESS THAN FIVE DAYS. AND THE COST- IS PERHAPS ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS TOTAL WHICH IS PROBABLY REIMBURSABLE ON THE FEDERAL SIDE ANYWAY- I WOULD COMMANDED THIS COMMITTEE. THAT YOU ASKED POINTED QUESTIONS ABOUT. CAN WE GET THIS DONE HERE IN CALIFORNIA YOU MAY EVEN WANT TO PUT THAT AS PART OF YOUR AGENDA IN FUTURE HEARINGS.
