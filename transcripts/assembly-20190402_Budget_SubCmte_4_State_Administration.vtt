00:38:12.556 --> 00:38:13.290

THAT WE HAD LOOKED AT WOULD COST

00:38:26.203 --> 00:38:26.737

00:38:26.804 --> 00:38:27.705
PAID FOR EVERYTHING IS FOUR

00:38:27.772 --> 00:38:29.006

01:04:08.678 --> 01:04:10.880
AND THE LAST FIFTH OFFICE IS THE

01:04:10.947 --> 01:04:11.681
OFFICE OF PROFESSIONAL

01:04:11.747 --> 01:04:13.249
EXAMINATION SERVICES WERE

01:04:13.316 --> 01:04:15.551
REQUEST TO POSITIONS AND FUNDING

01:04:15.618 --> 01:04:17.119
TO MEET THE INCREASED WORKLOAD

01:04:17.186 --> 01:04:18.354
FOR DEVELOPING MAINTAINING AND

01:04:18.421 --> 01:04:21.857
BIT INVALIDATING OCCUPATIONAL

01:04:21.924 --> 01:04:23.993
LICENSING EXAMINATIONS.

01:04:24.060 --> 01:04:26.162
SO WE THAT'S THAT'S OUR PROPOSAL

01:04:26.229 --> 01:04:27.863
A WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR

01:04:27.930 --> 01:04:30.032
SUPPORT IN HERE RESPOND TO ANY

01:04:30.099 --> 01:04:31.100
QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE.

01:04:31.167 --> 01:04:32.568
THANK YOU L. L..

01:04:32.635 --> 01:04:33.636
SO AS YOU HEARD THERE ARE

01:04:33.703 --> 01:04:35.104
MULTIPLE COMPONENTS OF THIS --

01:04:35.171 --> 01:04:37.139
PROPOSAL SUMMER FUNDED BASED ON

01:04:37.206 --> 01:04:38.507
USAGE SO SOMETHING LIKE AN

01:04:38.574 --> 01:04:39.809
HOURLY RATE SOME OF THEM ARE

01:04:39.875 --> 01:04:40.676
FUNDED BASED ON WHAT'S CALLED

01:04:40.743 --> 01:04:42.345
PER RAT I WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY A

01:04:42.411 --> 01:04:44.080
WAY TO SPREAD COST OUT.

01:04:44.146 --> 01:04:45.147
ON TYPICALLY IT'S DONE BY

01:04:45.214 --> 01:04:46.482
POSITION COUNTS OF THE BOARDS IN

01:04:46.549 --> 01:04:48.551
EUROS PAY MORE IF THEY HAVE MORE

01:04:48.618 --> 01:04:49.752
POSITIONS LIKE THAT THEY HAVE

01:04:49.819 --> 01:04:50.886
YOUR POSITIONS.

01:04:50.953 --> 01:04:52.154
SO WE'RE RECOMMENDING REJECTING

01:04:52.221 --> 01:04:53.422
THE COMPONENTS THAT ARE FUNDED

01:04:53.489 --> 01:04:55.391
ON A PRO RATA BASIS THERE REALLY

01:04:55.458 --> 01:04:56.959
TWO REASONS FOR THAT THE FIRST

01:04:57.026 --> 01:04:58.594
IS THAT WE THINK THAT IT'S

01:04:58.661 --> 01:05:00.062
GENERALLY PREMATURE TO DO THIS --

01:05:00.129 --> 01:05:01.597
THE REASON FOR THAT IS THAT LAST

01:05:01.664 --> 01:05:02.298
YEAR IN THE BUDGET THE

01:05:02.365 --> 01:05:04.800
LEGISLATURE -- PROVIDED FUNDING

01:05:04.867 --> 01:05:06.402
FOR THE DEPARTMENT TO DO YOU --

01:05:06.469 --> 01:05:07.937
SOME BUSINESS PROCESS REVIEWS OF

01:05:08.004 --> 01:05:09.772
THEIR PRO RATA FUNDED SERVICES

01:05:09.839 --> 01:05:11.874
AND THEY'VE ONLY COMPLETED ONE A

01:05:11.941 --> 01:05:13.743
PORTION OF THOSE REVIEWS MOST OF

01:05:13.809 --> 01:05:14.377
THOSE REVIEWS HAVE NOT YET BEEN

01:05:14.443 --> 01:05:16.746
COMPLETED -- SO WE THINK THAT --

01:05:16.812 --> 01:05:18.281
IT WOULD BE BETTER TO WAIT UNTIL

01:05:18.347 --> 01:05:19.181
THOSE ARE COMPLETED.

01:05:19.248 --> 01:05:20.383
AND THE SECOND.

01:05:20.449 --> 01:05:22.318
REASON IS THAT WE THINK IN SOME

01:05:22.385 --> 01:05:23.919
AREAS THAT WE'RE GOOD

01:05:23.986 --> 01:05:25.354
JUSTIFICATION IS LACKING --

01:05:25.421 --> 01:05:27.623
EXAMPLE A THERE WAS A TRANSITION

01:05:27.690 --> 01:05:30.426
OF ONE OF THE BUREAU'S WITHIN

01:05:30.493 --> 01:05:32.428
THE DEPARTMENT OUT -- TWO

01:05:32.495 --> 01:05:33.696
SEPARATE DEPARTMENT -- AND

01:05:33.763 --> 01:05:34.797
THOUGH THERE SHOULD BE SOME

01:05:34.864 --> 01:05:36.299
ASSOCIATED REDUCTION IN THE

01:05:36.365 --> 01:05:38.267
WORKLOAD ASSOCIATED WITH --

01:05:38.334 --> 01:05:39.001
PROVIDING SERVICES TO THAT

01:05:39.068 --> 01:05:40.636
BUREAU WHICH YOU DON'T THINK

01:05:40.703 --> 01:05:41.203
IT'S FULLY REFLECTED IN THE

01:05:41.270 --> 01:05:43.172
PROPOSAL ADDITIONALLY I'VE YOU

01:05:43.239 --> 01:05:44.340
HEARD A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT

01:05:44.407 --> 01:05:45.708
ESTABLISHMENT OF THIS NEW

01:05:45.775 --> 01:05:48.944
REGULATORY -- REVIEW UNIT WITHIN

01:05:49.011 --> 01:05:51.514
THE CA -- AND THE WORKLOAD

01:05:51.580 --> 01:05:52.848
JUSTIFICATION DOESN'T FULLY TAKE

01:05:52.915 --> 01:05:54.150
INTO ACCOUNT THAT CURRENTLY

01:05:54.216 --> 01:05:55.785
THERE ARE SOME STAFF AT THE

01:05:55.851 --> 01:05:57.620
DEPARTMENT THAT ARE REVIEWING --

01:05:57.687 --> 01:06:00.756
REGULATORY -- SUBMISSIONS FROM

01:06:00.823 --> 01:06:02.425
BUREAUS IMPORTS AND SO WE THINK

01:06:02.491 --> 01:06:03.526
THAT THOSE ARE SOME OTHER

01:06:03.592 --> 01:06:08.030
REASONS FOR REJECTING -- THE

01:06:08.097 --> 01:06:09.999
PAROTID COMPONENT [inaudible]

01:06:10.066 --> 01:06:11.033
FINANCE.

01:06:11.100 --> 01:06:12.134
KITCHEN DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WE

01:06:12.201 --> 01:06:14.537
CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THE REQUEST

01:06:14.603 --> 01:06:17.907
AS PROPOSED AS DCA HAD NOTED --

01:06:17.973 --> 01:06:19.775
THE RESOURCES FOR THAT A

01:06:19.842 --> 01:06:21.977
DEDICATED REGULATIONS UNIT AND

01:06:22.044 --> 01:06:23.446
THE ACCOUNTING FISCAL SERVICES.

01:06:23.512 --> 01:06:24.647
ARE REQUESTED A LIMóN TERM

01:06:24.714 --> 01:06:28.651
BASIS AND THESE ARE THE OFFICES

01:06:28.718 --> 01:06:30.319
THAT ARE FUNDED ON A PRO RATA

01:06:30.386 --> 01:06:32.555
BASIS -- WE THINK THAT'S

01:06:32.621 --> 01:06:33.656
PROVIDES FLEXIBILITY FOR THE

01:06:33.723 --> 01:06:34.824
DEPARTMENT TO ADDRESS MORE

01:06:34.890 --> 01:06:37.026
IMMEDIATE ISSUES -- AND WORKLOAD

01:06:37.093 --> 01:06:38.461
INCREASES WHILE LYING FOR THE

01:06:38.527 --> 01:06:41.464
SUBSEQUENT EVALUATION OF ONGOING

01:06:41.530 --> 01:06:43.799
RESOURCE NEEDS BASED ON THE

01:06:43.866 --> 01:06:44.333
ORGANIZATIONAL MANAGEMENT

01:06:44.400 --> 01:06:47.269
REVIEWS -- WE ALSO ACKNOWLEDGE

01:06:47.336 --> 01:06:49.138
THAT FISCAL HAS SIGNIFICANTLY

01:06:49.205 --> 01:06:51.073
AND IMPACT TO THE DEPARTMENTS

01:06:51.140 --> 01:06:53.509
PROCESS SEES AND TO YOUR LIMITED

01:06:53.576 --> 01:06:56.078
TERM RESOURCES ARE NEEDED -- TO

01:06:56.145 --> 01:06:58.080
HELP ADDRESS THE THE INCREASE TO

01:06:58.147 --> 01:06:59.382
WORK WITH THE PROMISED SPERRIN

01:06:59.448 --> 01:07:00.416
SEEING.

01:07:00.483 --> 01:07:01.550
WERE ALSO SUPPORTIVE OF THE

01:07:01.617 --> 01:07:04.820
REGULATIONS UNIT BECAUSE THERE'S

01:07:04.887 --> 01:07:06.756
A CAPACITY ISSUE -- THE EXISTING

01:07:06.822 --> 01:07:08.257
STAFF SIMPLY JUST DON'T HAVE THE

01:07:08.324 --> 01:07:09.759
CAPACITY TO ADDRESS THE

01:07:09.825 --> 01:07:11.827
SIGNIFICANT VOLUME OF

01:07:11.894 --> 01:07:13.796
REGULATIONS INCLUDING INCREASED

01:07:13.863 --> 01:07:16.966
WORKLOAD FROM AB -- TWENTY ONE

01:07:17.032 --> 01:07:17.466
THIRTY EIGHT WE THINK A

01:07:17.533 --> 01:07:18.834
DEDICATED UNIT ONE PROVE THE

01:07:18.901 --> 01:07:20.436
QUALITY AND ALSO REDUCED

EXISTING TIMELINES. FOR

01:07:27.410 --> 01:07:28.844
LEGISLATURE AS WELL.

01:07:28.911 --> 01:07:34.850
THE REGULATIONS ISSUE -- WHAT IS?

01:07:34.917 --> 01:07:37.686
THE SORRY A IS THE PROVIDER

01:07:37.753 --> 01:07:38.354
WORKING GROUP'S HIGHEST PRIORITY

01:07:38.421 --> 01:07:40.189
FOR THE ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGE

01:07:40.256 --> 01:07:41.724
MANAGEMENT REVIEWS.

01:07:41.791 --> 01:07:43.025

AND THE BOARDS AND BUREAUS.

01:08:24.200 --> 01:08:26.869
ON THE TOPIC OF HOW DCA REFORMS

01:08:26.936 --> 01:08:28.204
THE WAY WHICH CRIMINAL RECORDS

01:08:28.270 --> 01:08:29.872
ARE CONSIDERED TO THE LICENSING

01:08:29.939 --> 01:08:31.273
APPLICATION PROCESS --

01:08:31.340 --> 01:08:33.609
SPECIFICALLY -- THE LEGISLATURE

01:08:33.676 --> 01:08:34.977
PASSED A LAW THAT GOVERNOR BROWN

01:08:35.044 --> 01:08:36.779
SIGNED THAT SAID THAT NON

VIOLENT OFFENSES THAT WERE

LONGER THAN SEVEN YEARS -- THERE

01:08:39.882 --> 01:08:41.784
WERE UNRELATED TO A LICENSE

01:08:41.851 --> 01:08:45.087
SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED AND AB

01:08:45.154 --> 01:08:45.688
TWENTY ONE THIRTY EIGHT WOULD

01:08:56.198 --> 01:08:56.632
WHEN WE WENT THROUGH THE

THE LEGAL AFFAIRS DIVISION HE

01:10:20.883 --> 01:10:21.884

YOU HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL

01:10:22.685 --> 01:10:24.420
QUESTIONS COULD.

01:10:24.486 --> 01:10:26.455
WHAT YOU ARE TO SPENDING THE

01:10:26.522 --> 01:10:27.656
COST OF THAT TO BE?

01:10:27.723 --> 01:10:30.292
AND HOW WILL I KNOW THAT IF WE

ACTUALLY BE USED FOR THAT

01:10:32.695 --> 01:10:33.662
BECAUSE AS YOU SAID IT'S GOING

01:10:33.729 --> 01:10:34.730
TO BE A TRADE OFF AND WHAT WE

01:10:34.797 --> 01:10:36.565
HAVE SEEN AS THEIR NUMBER OF DCA

01:10:36.632 --> 01:10:37.166
DEPARTMENTS.

01:10:37.232 --> 01:10:39.168
OR BUREAUS AND BOARDS THAT HAD

01:10:39.234 --> 01:10:41.236
OPPOSED THE BILL AND I SUSPECT

01:10:41.303 --> 01:10:43.639
MAY NOT BE.

01:10:43.706 --> 01:10:47.476
ITCHING TO IMPLEMENT THIS.

01:10:47.543 --> 01:10:50.279
SO THE THE THE COST THAT WE HAVE --

01:10:50.346 --> 01:10:52.681
OBVIOUSLY AS WE AS WE LOOK INTO

01:10:52.748 --> 01:10:55.551
THE REGULATIONS UNIT WE HAVE A

01:10:55.618 --> 01:10:57.152
IF I HAVE THE THE NUMBERS

01:10:57.219 --> 01:11:00.222
CORRECTLY -- ONE SECOND IT'S ONE

01:11:00.289 --> 01:11:03.759
POINT SIX SEVEN MILLION IN --

01:11:03.826 --> 01:11:05.027
NINETEEN NINETEEN TWENTY IT IS A

01:11:05.094 --> 01:11:06.328
THREE THE THE POSITIONS ARE

01:11:06.395 --> 01:11:08.130
THREE YEAR LIMITED TERM SO WE

01:11:08.197 --> 01:11:10.833
WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT -- WE

01:11:10.899 --> 01:11:12.568
ARE HITTING THE SWEET SPOT SO TO

01:11:12.635 --> 01:11:13.769
SPEAK IN TERMS OF THE ACTUAL

01:11:13.836 --> 01:11:16.639
POSITIONS THAT WE'RE SUGGESTS --

01:11:16.705 --> 01:11:17.806
ABER.

01:11:17.873 --> 01:11:19.842
SUGGESTING -- AND AFTER THREE

01:11:19.908 --> 01:11:20.843
YEARS HOPEFULLY AFTER WE

01:11:20.909 --> 01:11:22.678
IMPLEMENT TWENTY ONE THIRTY

01:11:22.745 --> 01:11:23.979
EIGHT AND MEET THE DEMANDS OF

01:11:24.046 --> 01:11:25.714
THE THE BACKLOG THAT WE CAN COME

01:11:25.781 --> 01:11:26.949
BACK TO LEGISLATURE AND MAKE

01:11:27.016 --> 01:11:28.817
SURE THAT WE ALL HAVE FOUND THE

01:11:28.884 --> 01:11:29.718
RIGHT APPROACH.

01:11:29.785 --> 01:11:31.020
SO THE PRICE TAG THE YOUR

01:11:31.086 --> 01:11:32.554
DEPARTMENT PLACED ON THIS BILL

01:11:32.621 --> 01:11:34.023
WAS TWO POINT FIVE MILLION

01:11:34.089 --> 01:11:35.524
DOLLARS AND SO.

01:11:35.591 --> 01:11:36.592
THE DEPARTMENT THAT YOU'RE

01:11:36.659 --> 01:11:38.027
SUGGESTING CREATING YOU'RE NOT

01:11:38.093 --> 01:11:39.328
EVEN SEND ALL OF THAT MONEY IS

01:11:39.395 --> 01:11:41.664
GOING TO GO TO IMPLEMENTING THIS

01:11:41.730 --> 01:11:41.830
NEW.

01:11:41.897 --> 01:11:42.431
PROGRAM RIGHT.

01:11:42.498 --> 01:11:43.399
COULD I JUST GET SOME MORE

01:11:43.465 --> 01:11:46.001
CLARITY ON HOW MUCH WHAT

01:11:46.068 --> 01:11:47.269

TODAY.

01:11:58.547 --> 01:12:00.315

CRIMES AND SEE A LIST OF THOSE

01:12:05.554 --> 01:12:06.989
IN CALIFORNIA WE'VE NUMBER OF

01:12:07.056 --> 01:12:08.991
CRIMES THAT ARE.

01:12:09.058 --> 01:12:09.458
CONSIDERED NOT ANSWERS

01:12:09.525 --> 01:12:10.626
NONVIOLENT.

01:12:10.693 --> 01:12:12.094
THAT IN MY PERSONAL OPINION I

01:12:12.161 --> 01:12:12.695
BELIEVE WE'RE DOING THE PUBLIC

01:12:12.761 --> 01:12:14.430

01:12:30.913 --> 01:12:32.014

THE REVIEW WAS COMPLETED.

01:13:06.315 --> 01:13:08.684
SO WE'RE HOLD THIS ITEM OPEN TO

01:13:08.751 --> 01:13:10.285
ALLOW MORE TIME FOR DISCUSSIONS

01:13:10.352 --> 01:13:11.754
THEY CONTINUE THE DIALOGUE

BREEZES SYSTEM UPDATE

AND BOARD OF ACCOUNTANCY OR TWO

01:14:02.337 --> 01:14:03.572

THE AMOUNT OF FIVE HUNDRED TWO

01:14:12.748 --> 01:14:13.816

01:14:17.252 --> 01:14:18.120
BOARD OF ACCOUNTANCY.

01:14:18.187 --> 01:14:19.421
THESE RESOURCES WILL ENGAGE IN

01:14:19.488 --> 01:14:20.722
CRITICAL PLANNING EFFORTS TO

01:14:20.789 --> 01:14:21.990
TRANSITION TO A NEW INFORMATION

01:14:22.057 --> 01:14:23.826
TECHNOLOGY SYSTEM AS PART OF

01:14:23.892 --> 01:14:25.594
THAT EACH PROGRAM'S INDIVIDUAL

01:14:25.661 --> 01:14:27.896
BUSINESS MODERNIZATION PLAN

01:14:27.963 --> 01:14:28.964
WE REQUEST SUPPORT OF THE

01:14:29.031 --> 01:14:31.066
SPECIES P. RESPECTFULLY AND

01:14:31.133 --> 01:14:32.501
WE'LL BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY

01:14:32.568 --> 01:14:33.001
QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE.

01:14:33.068 --> 01:14:34.069
L. L..

01:14:34.136 --> 01:14:34.937
SO WE'RE NOT READING ANY

01:14:35.003 --> 01:14:36.471
CONCERNS WITH THE VC PEAS UNDER

01:14:36.538 --> 01:14:38.006
CONSIDERATION TODAY WE DID HAVE

01:14:38.073 --> 01:14:40.108
SOME LARGER COMMENTS RELATED TO

01:14:40.175 --> 01:14:41.610
THE BUSINESS MODERNIZATION PLAN

01:14:41.677 --> 01:14:43.679
AND THIS IS BASICALLY -- THE

01:14:43.745 --> 01:14:45.547
PLAN FOR THE REMAINING BOARDS IN

01:14:45.614 --> 01:14:47.850
BUREAUS THAT WERE ON THE

01:14:47.916 --> 01:14:49.484
ORIGINAL BREEZE PROJECT BUT THEN --

01:14:49.551 --> 01:14:50.686
SUBSEQUENTLY BREEZE WAS

01:14:50.752 --> 01:14:52.020
TERMINATED AND SO THESE ARE THE

01:14:52.087 --> 01:14:53.355
BOARDS IN BUREAUS THAT ARE

01:14:53.422 --> 01:14:54.890
REMAINING AND THEY STILL NEED

01:14:54.957 --> 01:14:57.326
SOME I. T. SOLUTION -- SO OUR

01:14:57.392 --> 01:14:59.428
COMMENTS GENERALLY -- FOLLOW

01:14:59.494 --> 01:15:01.263
THAT THE TRAIN OF THOUGHT THAT

01:15:01.330 --> 01:15:03.365
THE BASICALLY THE DEPARTMENTS

01:15:03.432 --> 01:15:04.867
APPROACH HAS BEEN TO ALLOW THESE

01:15:04.933 --> 01:15:06.068
BOARDS IN BUREAU TO KIND OF MOVE

01:15:06.134 --> 01:15:07.736
AT THEIR OWN PACE THESE RELEASED

01:15:07.803 --> 01:15:09.137
THREE ENTITIES -- SO SOME OF

01:15:09.204 --> 01:15:10.272
THEM ARE MOVING MORE QUICKLY

01:15:10.339 --> 01:15:11.240
SOME OF THEM ARE MOVING LESS

01:15:11.306 --> 01:15:13.342
QUICKLY THE RATIONALE FOR THAT

01:15:13.408 --> 01:15:14.376
ACCORDING TO THE DEPARTMENT IS

01:15:14.443 --> 01:15:15.477
BASICALLY THAT SOME OF THESE

01:15:15.544 --> 01:15:17.312
ENTITIES -- ARE HAVE MORE

01:15:17.379 --> 01:15:18.680
ORGANIZATIONAL READY NESTS

01:15:18.747 --> 01:15:20.716
CURRENTLY TODAY -- AND ARE

01:15:20.782 --> 01:15:21.550
PREPARED TO MOVE FASTER THAN

01:15:21.617 --> 01:15:23.418
OTHERS -- SO THAT MAKES SENSE TO

01:15:23.485 --> 01:15:24.419
SOME DEGREE BUT THERE ARE SOME

01:15:24.486 --> 01:15:26.722
REPERCUSSIONS -- SOME OF THESE

01:15:26.788 --> 01:15:28.857
ENTITIES ARE AS A RESULT MOVING

01:15:28.924 --> 01:15:31.493
MORE SLOWLY THAN OTHERS AS YOU

01:15:31.560 --> 01:15:33.061
MIGHT EXPECT -- AND THE CURRENT --

01:15:33.128 --> 01:15:34.429
BUSINESS MODERNIZATION REPORT

01:15:34.496 --> 01:15:36.298
THAT WAS RELEASED IN DECEMBER

01:15:36.365 --> 01:15:37.933
REFLECT THAT SOME ENTITIES

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:39.668
CURRENTLY HAVE KIND OF T. B. D.

01:15:39.735 --> 01:15:41.236
AS THEIR AS THEIR CURRENT

01:15:41.303 --> 01:15:43.038
TIMELINE OR TIME LINES THAT ARE

01:15:43.105 --> 01:15:44.473
SEVERAL YEARS OFF.

01:15:44.539 --> 01:15:45.574
AND SO WE THINK THIS MAKES IT A

01:15:45.641 --> 01:15:46.508
LITTLE BIT MORE CHALLENGING FOR

01:15:46.575 --> 01:15:47.676
THE LEGISLATURE TO HAVE

01:15:47.743 --> 01:15:49.144
OVERSIGHT OVER THE PROJECT AND

01:15:49.211 --> 01:15:50.612
IT RAISES SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT

01:15:50.679 --> 01:15:51.947
REALLY WHAT THE APPROPRIATE ROLE

01:15:52.014 --> 01:15:52.981
FOR THE DEPARTMENT IS IN TERMS

01:15:53.048 --> 01:15:54.416
OF OVERSEEING THESE PROJECTS AND

01:15:54.483 --> 01:15:55.517
HOW MUCH THE DEPARTMENT SHOULD

01:15:55.584 --> 01:15:56.251
TAKE A LEADERSHIP.

01:15:56.318 --> 01:15:57.819
ROLE INSTEAD OF MAKING SURE

01:15:57.886 --> 01:16:00.222
THESE BOARDS IN BUREAUS-- MOVE

01:16:00.289 --> 01:16:02.524
AT AT AT AT SORT OF RELATIVELY

01:16:02.591 --> 01:16:03.959
QUICK PACE I WOULD NOTE THAT THE

01:16:04.026 --> 01:16:05.327
LEGISLATURE HAS PASSED LANGUAGE

01:16:05.394 --> 01:16:06.662
IN THE PAST THAT REQUIRED THIS

01:16:06.728 --> 01:16:08.297
REPORT AND REQUIRED UPDATES ON

01:16:08.363 --> 01:16:09.598
THESE TIME LINES.

01:16:09.665 --> 01:16:10.933
I'M SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE THERE

01:16:10.999 --> 01:16:12.401
WAS INTEREST IN MAKING SURE THAT

01:16:12.467 --> 01:16:13.468
THESE ENTITIES GOT THE

01:16:13.535 --> 01:16:15.070
TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS THAT THEY

01:16:15.137 --> 01:16:17.339
NEEDED IN A TIMELY FASHION -- SO

01:16:17.406 --> 01:16:18.607
OUR RECOMMENDATION IS TO HAVE

01:16:18.674 --> 01:16:20.309
THE CA REPORTED HEARING SUCH AS

01:16:20.375 --> 01:16:21.610
THIS ONE AS WELL AS THE RELEVANT

01:16:21.677 --> 01:16:24.513
BOARDS AND BUREAUS.

01:16:24.579 --> 01:16:25.514
I'M REALLY ONLINE.

01:16:25.580 --> 01:16:26.548
THE DEPARTMENT'S RATIONALE FOR

01:16:26.615 --> 01:16:28.684
THEIR APPROACH OF IN IN TERMS OF

01:16:28.750 --> 01:16:30.152
HAVING THESE BOARDS IN EUROS

01:16:30.218 --> 01:16:32.354
MOVE THROUGH THIS PROCESS -- AS

01:16:32.421 --> 01:16:35.891
WELL AS AS THE SPECIFIC REASON

01:16:35.958 --> 01:16:37.592
SOMEBODY'S ENTITIES NOW HAVE T.

01:16:37.659 --> 01:16:40.128
B. D. AS THEIR TIME LINES AND WE

01:16:40.195 --> 01:16:40.629
THINK THIS WILL HELP THE

01:16:40.696 --> 01:16:41.263
LEGISLATURE.

01:16:41.330 --> 01:16:42.631
IN A WAY WHETHER IT'S

01:16:42.698 --> 01:16:43.799
COMFORTABLE WITH THE APPROACH

01:16:43.865 --> 01:16:45.267
THAT THE DEPARTMENT TAKING OR IF

01:16:45.334 --> 01:16:46.535
THE DIP AT THE LEGISLATURE AND

01:16:46.601 --> 01:16:48.303
WANTED TO DIRECT THE DEPARTMENT

01:16:48.370 --> 01:16:50.205
TO TAKE A MORE HANDS ON APPROACH.

01:23:04.846 --> 01:23:07.315
THE SAME.

01:23:07.382 --> 01:23:08.717
STUFF THE SAME B. S. AND IT'S

01:23:08.783 --> 01:23:09.918
JUST IT'S JUST I'M DONE.

01:23:09.984 --> 01:23:11.553
THERE ARE NO MORE EXCUSES.

01:23:11.619 --> 01:23:12.854
NO TWENTY TWENTY FIVE IS NOT

01:23:12.921 --> 01:23:14.522
ACCEPTABLE.

01:23:14.589 --> 01:23:16.891
GET TOGETHERS IT.

01:23:16.958 --> 01:23:18.660
IT'S NOT THAT COMPLICATED.

01:23:18.727 --> 01:23:21.496
WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO IT?

01:23:21.563 --> 01:23:22.731
SO I JUST I MEAN WITH SOME

01:23:22.797 --> 01:23:24.332
STARTLING MONEY AT NOT DOING

01:23:24.399 --> 01:23:25.767
ANYMORE.

01:23:25.834 --> 01:23:27.869
SORRY MR TO NóI.

01:23:27.936 --> 01:23:29.337
HI I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THAT

01:23:29.404 --> 01:23:30.605
WERE WERE ON THE SAME PAGE ON

01:23:30.672 --> 01:23:32.707
THIS BECAUSE EVERY YEAR WE'VE

01:23:32.774 --> 01:23:33.875
APPROVED HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF

01:23:33.942 --> 01:23:35.577
DOLLARS OF IT PROJECTS AND WE'RE

01:23:35.643 --> 01:23:36.911
NOT SEEN ANY FRUITION IN FACT IT

01:23:36.978 --> 01:23:37.779
SEEMS LIKE.

01:23:37.846 --> 01:23:39.581
THE DATES THAT WERE SET KEEP

01:23:39.647 --> 01:23:41.916
STRETCHING SO I THINK FROM YOUR

01:23:41.983 --> 01:23:43.251
PERSPECTIVE IF YOU THINK IT'S

01:23:43.318 --> 01:23:44.586
STRATEGIC A STRATEGIC IF YOU'RE

01:23:44.652 --> 01:23:46.020
TRYING TO AVOID THE OVERSIGHT OF

01:23:46.087 --> 01:23:46.788
THIS COMMITTEE.

01:23:46.855 --> 01:23:48.923
BUT I HAVE SAID IN PRIOR YEARS

01:23:48.990 --> 01:23:50.158
THAT THERE IS GOING TO COME A

01:23:50.225 --> 01:23:51.659
POINT WHERE I CAN APPROVE THESE

01:23:51.726 --> 01:23:52.961
ANYMORE AND I FEEL LIKE.

01:23:53.027 --> 01:23:55.630
WE'VE HIT THAT POINT SO -- I

01:23:55.697 --> 01:23:58.466
HEAR EVERYTHING YOU'RE SAYING IT

01:23:58.533 --> 01:23:58.900
SOUNDS LIKE A LOT OF

01:23:58.967 --> 01:23:59.701
BUREAUCRATIC.

01:23:59.768 --> 01:24:01.035
MUMBLE JUMBLE THAT.

01:24:01.102 --> 01:24:02.570
FRANKLY I DON'T THINK CAN

01:24:02.637 --> 01:24:03.571
EXPLAIN TO THE PUBLIC HOW WE

01:24:03.638 --> 01:24:05.240
SPENT MILLIONS OF DOLLARS.

01:24:05.306 --> 01:24:07.409
I DON'T THINK IF YOU HAD THIS

01:24:07.475 --> 01:24:09.144
PROJECT TO DO IN ANY OTHER

01:24:09.210 --> 01:24:10.412
SECTOR THAT THERE IT WOULD BE

01:24:10.478 --> 01:24:12.680
ACCEPTED TO SAY THE TWENTY

01:24:12.747 --> 01:24:13.748
TWENTY FIVE IS.

01:24:13.815 --> 01:24:14.582
A IS A DATE THAT WE'RE SUPPOSED

01:24:14.649 --> 01:24:16.050
TO GET THINGS DONE IN IT THE

01:24:16.117 --> 01:24:17.552
TECHNOLOGY IS GOING TO CHANGE

01:24:17.619 --> 01:24:18.820
THREE TIMES.

01:24:18.887 --> 01:24:21.723
BY THAT DATE SO -- I CAN

01:24:21.790 --> 01:24:23.725
UNDERSTAND HOW IT IS THAT WE

01:24:23.792 --> 01:24:25.894
SHOULD BE EXPECTED HAVE FAITH

01:24:25.960 --> 01:24:28.163

CREATED AN OVERLAY AND A

01:25:17.245 --> 01:25:18.680
STRATEGY THAT I WAS.

01:25:18.746 --> 01:25:20.915

FIRST PHASE OF THE PROJECT I

01:26:52.874 --> 01:26:56.044
BELIEVE WERE -- UP ABOVE FIVE

01:26:56.110 --> 01:26:57.145
HUNDRED ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGE

LOT LONGER SCHEDULE BUT WE DO

01:27:29.143 --> 01:27:31.479

TYPICALLY IF YOU LEARN LESSONS

01:27:50.331 --> 01:27:51.299
YOU'RE ABLE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO

01:27:51.366 --> 01:27:52.700
DO THINGS FASTER.

01:27:52.767 --> 01:27:53.601

JUST NOT PREPARED TO SUPPORT

01:28:10.785 --> 01:28:12.086
THIS AT THIS TIME WHICH WE JUST

01:28:12.153 --> 01:28:12.954
NEED TO HAVE.

01:28:13.021 --> 01:28:14.322
BETTER PLANS AND AND MORE

THE NEXT WEEK OR TWO IS THE

01:28:25.299 --> 01:28:26.734
INITIAL ONE BREEZES STOOD UP

01:28:26.801 --> 01:28:28.536
INITIAL COST TO STAND RESULT.

01:28:37.979 --> 01:28:40.248
TODAY AND THEN ON THE HAND OUT

01:28:40.314 --> 01:28:42.083
ON PAGE FORTY THREE THE THE

01:28:42.150 --> 01:28:43.518
CHART YOU HAVE SOME THESE THINGS

01:28:43.584 --> 01:28:46.120
SAYS DELAYED -- DELAYED IS NOT

01:28:46.187 --> 01:28:48.189
ACCEPTABLE -- GIVE A SMART DATES

01:28:48.256 --> 01:28:49.757

01:28:49.824 --> 01:28:51.325
YOU'VE GOT ONE TWENTY TWENTY

01:28:51.392 --> 01:28:53.161
FIVE DID IN HERE BUT DELAYED

01:28:53.227 --> 01:28:54.829
COULD BE.

01:28:54.896 --> 01:28:55.596
TWENTY TWENTY SIX IN ALL AT WHAT

01:28:55.663 --> 01:28:57.932

01:29:00.001 --> 01:29:01.269
THERE WE HAVE DATES THEIR WORK

01:29:01.335 --> 01:29:04.939
WAS OPERATIONAL -- NEED -- TO

01:29:05.006 --> 01:29:06.908
THE SCHEDULE FOR TOO SMALL OF

01:29:06.974 --> 01:29:08.443
OUR SMALLER BOARDS FOR A

01:29:08.509 --> 01:29:10.344
RESOURCE PURPOSES AND WERE ABLE

01:29:10.411 --> 01:29:11.345
TO DO THAT SO THOSE WE CAN BUT I

01:29:11.412 --> 01:29:12.780
THINK WHEN YOU COME THE PEOPLE

THAT FUND YOUR PROJECT.

01:29:14.649 --> 01:29:16.350
NEED TO HAVE A HARD DATE.

01:29:16.417 --> 01:29:18.052
DO A DELAYED IS I MEAN I'M NOT

01:29:18.119 --> 01:29:19.353

01:29:19.420 --> 01:29:20.555
NOTHING FOR ME.

01:29:20.621 --> 01:29:23.091
SO A LOT OF OUR COMMENTS HERE --

01:29:23.157 --> 01:29:27.729
THE REMOTELY THIS ITEM WOULD

01:29:27.795 --> 01:29:28.463
HOLD OPEN.

01:29:28.529 --> 01:29:29.030

BEING SAID TODAY.

01:29:32.333 --> 01:29:33.968
SO IF THERE'S ANY CHANCE THIS

01:29:34.035 --> 01:29:37.238
GETTING PASSED THROUGH.

01:29:37.305 --> 01:29:40.041
SOMETHING IS HAPPENING.
