IMPROVEMENT THERE WERE SEVERAL

00:18:15.761 --> 00:18:17.029
LESSONS WE LEARNED IN THE

00:18:17.095 --> 00:18:18.363
SPRING THAT WE ARE ABLE TO

00:18:18.430 --> 00:18:20.332
BUILD UPON FOR IMPROVE DISTANCE

00:18:20.399 --> 00:18:22.301
LEARNING. PROGRAM IN THE FALL.

00:18:22.367 --> 00:18:23.735
AS WE PRESENT YOU TODAY WILL

00:18:23.802 --> 00:18:25.170
PRESENT WE WILL TOUCH UPON EACH

OF THESE LESSONS LEARNED AND

00:18:26.572 --> 00:18:27.940
HIGHLIGHTED HOW OUR PARTNERSHIP

00:18:28.006 --> 00:18:29.274
HELPED US IMPROVE UPON OUR WORK

00:18:29.341 --> 00:18:31.610
IN THE SPRING. GIVEN TIME

00:18:31.677 --> 00:18:33.345
CONSTRAINTS WE PUT KEY TOPICS

00:18:33.412 --> 00:18:34.179
AND IDEAS ON OUR SITES

00:18:34.246 --> 00:18:35.347
RECOGNIZING THAT WE WILL NOT

00:18:35.414 --> 00:18:37.783
HAVE ENOUGH TIME TO GOING TO

00:18:37.850 --> 00:18:40.752
EACH AREA IN GREAT DETAIL.

00:18:40.819 --> 00:18:42.154
RIGHT SO ONE OF THE FIRST

00:18:42.221 --> 00:18:43.989
THINGS THAT WE REALIZED IS THAT

00:18:44.056 --> 00:18:45.591
WE HAVE TO SUPPORTER

00:18:45.657 --> 00:18:46.058
PRACTITIONERS IN THIS

00:18:46.125 --> 00:18:48.427
ADJUSTMENT. AND HONESTLY IN

00:18:48.494 --> 00:18:50.095
NORMAL TIMES IT'S DIFFICULT TO

00:18:50.162 --> 00:18:51.396
COVER ALL OF THE STANDARDS AND

00:18:51.463 --> 00:18:53.966
IN OUR VIRTUAL MODEL OR IN A

00:18:54.032 --> 00:18:54.533
HYBRID MODEL THAT CHALLENGE

00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:56.535
INCREASES. SO ONE OF THE FIRST

00:18:56.602 --> 00:18:58.370
THINGS WE SET OUT TO DO OVER

00:18:58.437 --> 00:18:59.705
THE SUMMER WAS TO TASK

00:18:59.771 --> 00:19:00.305
ADMINISTRATORS AND

00:19:00.372 --> 00:19:02.241
PRACTITIONERS. IN REVIEWING

00:19:02.307 --> 00:19:03.842
STANDARDS BY GRADE LEVEL AND

00:19:03.909 --> 00:19:05.644
CONTENT AREA AND LIFTING UP THE

00:19:05.711 --> 00:19:07.913
POWER STANDARDS TO IDENTIFY

00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:10.449
EITHER THE POWER CENTERS OR

00:19:10.516 --> 00:19:12.284
BUILDING BLOCKS STANDARDS. ONCE

00:19:12.351 --> 00:19:14.620
THEY IDENTIFY THOSE WE NAME

00:19:14.686 --> 00:19:16.488
THEM THE ESSENTIAL STANDARDS.

00:19:16.555 --> 00:19:18.991
IDENTIFYING THESE STANDARDS IT

00:19:19.057 --> 00:19:20.058
CREATED MORE SYSTEM ALIGNMENT

00:19:20.125 --> 00:19:21.693
AS WELL AS ALLOWING TIME FOR

00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:22.661
TEACHERS TO PRIORITIZE

00:19:22.728 --> 00:19:24.930
RELATIONSHIPS. AND COMMUNITY

00:19:24.997 --> 00:19:26.231
BUILDING SO THAT STUDENTS DO

00:19:26.298 --> 00:19:28.166
FEEL CONNECTED EVEN THOUGH

00:19:28.233 --> 00:19:30.469
WE'RE IN A VIRTUAL WORLD. YOU

00:19:30.536 --> 00:19:33.071
CAN ALSO SEE SOME AND TRAINING

00:19:33.138 --> 00:19:35.007
MODULES THAT WERE CREATED- I

00:19:35.073 --> 00:19:37.042
WOULD DO WANT TO FOCUS ON THE

00:19:37.109 --> 00:19:39.144
LESSEN BANKS. SO WE CO SELECTED

00:19:39.211 --> 00:19:40.946
PRACTITIONERS TO DESIGN LESSONS

00:19:41.013 --> 00:19:42.948
TO- SERVE EITHER FOR A FLIPPED

00:19:43.015 --> 00:19:45.183
CLASSROOM WHERE STUDENTS WATCH

00:19:45.250 --> 00:19:48.053
THE LESSON DURING ASYNCHRONOUS

00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:48.654
TIME AND THEN WHEN THEY'RE IN

00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:49.655
SYNCHRONOUS TIME WITH THEIR

00:19:49.721 --> 00:19:53.091
CLASSROOM TEACHER. THEY THE

00:19:53.158 --> 00:19:53.525
TEACHER CAN PROVIDE

00:19:53.592 --> 00:19:54.660
DIFFERENTIATION. THE LESSON

00:19:54.726 --> 00:19:56.862
BIKE LESSONS ALSO SERVED AS

00:19:56.929 --> 00:19:59.231
MODEL LESSONS FOR COLLEAGUES.

00:19:59.298 --> 00:20:01.033
AS YOU CAN SEE WE ALSO HAD TO

00:20:01.099 --> 00:20:04.603
IDENTIFY TIME TO PREPARE. ALLOW

00:20:04.670 --> 00:20:05.904
PEOPLE TO PREPARE TO ALLOW THEM

00:20:05.971 --> 00:20:07.005
TO COLLABORATE AND WE

00:20:07.072 --> 00:20:11.710
PRIORITIZE SOCIAL JUSTICE. IN

00:20:11.777 --> 00:20:12.578
OTHER LESSONS LEARNED WAS THE

00:20:12.644 --> 00:20:14.079
NEED TO STRENGTHEN SCHOOL HOME

00:20:14.146 --> 00:20:17.049
CONNECTIONS. AND SO WE CAN IN A

00:20:17.115 --> 00:20:18.183
LEARNING LESSONS FROM THE

00:20:18.250 --> 00:20:20.118
SPRING WE REALLY FOCUSED ON

00:20:20.185 --> 00:20:21.420
STRENGTHENING OUR COMMUNICATION

00:20:21.486 --> 00:20:23.789
EFFORTS REALLY KNOWING THAT

00:20:23.855 --> 00:20:25.457
CLEAR AND TIMELY COMMUNICATION.

00:20:25.524 --> 00:20:27.092
IS OFTEN A CHALLENGE BUT IT'S

00:20:27.159 --> 00:20:29.027
SO IMPORTANT DURING THIS TIME

00:20:29.094 --> 00:20:31.096
WHERE INFORMATION IS CHANGING

00:20:31.163 --> 00:20:34.366
AND WEEKLY AND AT TIMES DALY.

00:20:34.433 --> 00:20:35.867
ANOTHER PIECE OF STRENGTHENING

00:20:35.934 --> 00:20:37.703
SCHOOL TO HOME CONNECTIONS WAS

00:20:37.769 --> 00:20:41.139
REALLY VALUING FAMILY CHOICE

00:20:41.206 --> 00:20:44.076
AND WITHIN OUR SYSTEM AS A PART

00:20:44.142 --> 00:20:45.043
OF OUR PLANNING FOR A LEARNING

00:20:45.110 --> 00:20:46.445
MODEL CONTINUE M. DURING THE

00:20:46.511 --> 00:20:48.213
SPEED INTERNET. AND SO BETWEEN

00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:48.847
THE DISTRICT AND THE

00:20:48.914 --> 00:20:50.682
ASSOCIATION THERE'S A SHARED

00:20:50.749 --> 00:20:53.352
GOAL AND THAT WE HAVE EXPANDING

00:20:53.418 --> 00:20:55.821
PROVIDING CHOICE- ACROSS OUR

00:20:55.887 --> 00:20:57.723
LEARNING MODEL CONTINUE ON SO

00:20:57.789 --> 00:21:00.592
THAT WE CAN POSSIBLY MEDICAID

00:21:00.659 --> 00:21:02.127
AS IT DECLINE ENROLLMENT. AND

00:21:02.194 --> 00:21:03.929
SO THERE'S A COUPLE EACH KEY

00:21:03.996 --> 00:21:05.464
AREAS WHERE WE IDENTIFIED THAT

00:21:05.530 --> 00:21:07.432
WE WOULD WORK TOGETHER TO

00:21:07.499 --> 00:21:09.868
EXPAND. AND ONE WAS OUR K.

00:21:09.935 --> 00:21:11.203
EIGHT HOME SCHOOL PROGRAM THAT

00:21:11.269 --> 00:21:14.272
EXISTED PRE COALBED. IT GREW

00:21:14.339 --> 00:21:19.311
FROM SEVENTY THREE STUDENTS IN.

00:21:19.378 --> 00:21:19.845
NINETEEN TWENTY TWO EIGHT

00:21:19.911 --> 00:21:20.345
HUNDRED AND FIFTY EIGHT

00:21:20.412 --> 00:21:22.147
STUDENTS THIS CURRENT SCHOOL

00:21:22.214 --> 00:21:24.850
YEAR. IN ADDITION WE HAD

00:21:24.916 --> 00:21:26.084
ANOTHER INDEPENDENT STUDY

PROGRAM FOR GRADES NINE THROUGH

00:21:28.420 --> 00:21:30.389
TWELVE. AND CREE COVE MADE IT

00:21:30.455 --> 00:21:31.857
WAS A HUNDRED AND SIXTY ONE

00:21:31.923 --> 00:21:33.158
STUDENTS ENROLLED IN THAT

00:21:33.225 --> 00:21:35.694

HEARING ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED

00:21:36.728 --> 00:21:38.730
STUDENTS THAT PROGRAM. AND SO

00:21:38.797 --> 00:21:40.032
WE BELIEVE THAT BY WORKING

00:21:40.098 --> 00:21:42.034
TOGETHER TO EXPAND TO THESE

00:21:42.100 --> 00:21:44.136
OPTIONS AND IT EXPANDED IN THE

00:21:44.202 --> 00:21:47.172

00:21:49.174 --> 00:21:50.308
FOR THE PRACTITIONER. THAT BY

EXPANDING THE OPTIONS AND

00:21:51.910 --> 00:21:53.512
HELPED US MITIGATE POTENTIAL

00:21:53.578 --> 00:21:55.313
DECLINING ENROLLMENT AS WE ONLY

00:21:55.380 --> 00:21:57.015
SAW A DROP IN OUR OVERALL

00:21:57.082 --> 00:22:00.819
MOMENT JUST UNDER TWO HUNDRED

00:22:00.886 --> 00:22:04.389
STUDENTS BELOW OUR PROJECTIONS.

00:22:04.456 --> 00:22:06.525
ANOTHER AREA THAT WAS A LESSON

LEARNED FOR US WAS TO INCREASE

00:22:08.026 --> 00:22:10.429

RESPONSE AND THIS VIRTUAL

00:22:11.797 --> 00:22:13.799
WORLD. AND SO ONE PIECE THAT WE

00:22:13.865 --> 00:22:15.500
WORKED ON TOGETHER AND THAT WAS

00:22:15.567 --> 00:22:17.069
TO REESTABLISH OUR INITIAL PRE

00:22:17.135 --> 00:22:18.970

SHARED GOOGLE DOC WE DID NOT

EXCHANGE FORMAL PROPOSALS. WE

00:24:14.052 --> 00:24:15.620
IDENTIFIED THAT WE HAD SHARED

00:24:15.687 --> 00:24:16.988
INTERESTS FROM ME THAT. WE

00:24:17.055 --> 00:24:18.824
WANTED TO IMPROVE UPON WHAT WE

00:24:18.890 --> 00:24:20.292
DID IN THE SPRING. SO OUR

00:24:20.358 --> 00:24:22.093

00:51:16.740 --> 00:51:18.341
3240% OF OUR KIDS. WILL BE

00:51:18.408 --> 00:51:19.910
FOUND MOSTLY WAS BECAUSE THEIR

00:51:19.976 --> 00:51:21.645
PARENTS DIDN'T HAVE THE STABLE

00:51:21.711 --> 00:51:23.413
STRUCTURE AT HOME. TO GET THEM

00:51:23.480 --> 00:51:24.748
ONLINE TO PROVIDE THAT SAFE

00:51:24.815 --> 00:51:26.516
SPACE FOR THEM. THEY BECAME THE

00:51:26.583 --> 00:51:28.018
BABYSITTERS THEY BECAME A

00:51:28.084 --> 00:51:30.287
SYSTEMS THAT WORK. AND SO A LOT

CURRICULUM OR THE TEACHING. IT

00:51:35.425 --> 00:51:36.660
WAS JUST THE FAMILY DIDN'T HAVE

00:51:36.726 --> 00:51:38.061
THE INFRASTRUCTURE TO PROVIDE A

00:51:38.128 --> 00:51:39.796
SAFE SPACE FOR LEARNING. NOW

00:51:39.863 --> 00:51:42.032

00:51:49.873 --> 00:51:52.275
TAKES THE ONUS OF. THE TEACHING

00:51:52.342 --> 00:51:53.310
LEARNING OFF THAT SCREEN TIME

00:51:53.376 --> 00:51:54.744
BUT MORE THE INDEPENDENT STUDY

WORK COMPLETION. AND THAT'S

00:51:56.546 --> 00:51:57.514

00:52:05.121 --> 00:52:06.656
NEEDS MET. AND THERE'S STILL A

00:52:06.723 --> 00:52:08.325

FIGURE OUT HOW TO BEST ENGAGE

00:52:13.230 --> 00:52:14.564

00:52:14.631 --> 00:52:15.966
CHOICE AND THEY HAVE A

RISE AND WHAT WE SHOULD BE

00:52:19.202 --> 00:52:20.904
MEASURING IS NOT WORK

00:52:20.971 --> 00:52:22.606

SHE MIGHT GUESS THERE'S NOT

01:01:00.490 --> 01:01:03.393
MORE. THAN BACK ABS INTERACTION

01:01:03.459 --> 01:01:05.328
BETWEEN THE STUDENT AND THE

01:01:05.395 --> 01:01:07.196
TEACHER AS WELL AS A PARENT AND

01:01:07.263 --> 01:01:09.599
SO ONE OF THE I THINK MORE

01:01:09.665 --> 01:01:11.401
SIGNIFICANT THINGS THAT THAT IS

01:01:11.467 --> 01:01:13.903
HAPPENING. IN REAL TIME RIGHT

01:01:13.970 --> 01:01:16.472
NOW ARE THE NUMBER OF CONTRACTS

01:01:16.539 --> 01:01:18.141
THAT STUDENTS ARE GETTING

01:01:18.207 --> 01:01:20.877
INDIVIDUALLY AND BACK ON IN AND

01:01:20.943 --> 01:01:22.545
OF ITSELF CAN MAKE SUCH A

01:01:22.612 --> 01:01:25.481
DIFFERENCE I TO ENSURE THAT

01:01:25.548 --> 01:01:28.718
BEST YOU UNDER WE'D MISS. MORE

01:01:28.785 --> 01:01:29.652
THAN THEY NEXT ASTON WE CAN'T

01:01:29.719 --> 01:01:31.921
WAIT RIGHT TO BE ABLE TO HAVE A

01:01:31.988 --> 01:01:33.723
MORE TYPICAL INTERACTION BUT

01:01:33.790 --> 01:01:36.092
WHAT OUR EDUCATORS ARE DOING-

01:01:36.159 --> 01:01:39.529
IS ACTUALLY UNPRECEDENTED- IN

01:01:39.595 --> 01:01:41.531
MY YEARS IN THIS FIELD. BUT I

01:01:41.597 --> 01:01:47.170
WANT TO QUICKLY JUMP IN ON ON.

01:01:47.236 --> 01:01:47.770
THAT COMMENT I THINK THAT. WE

01:01:47.837 --> 01:01:48.905
SHOULD TRY PERFECT WHICH IS

01:01:48.971 --> 01:01:50.740
PROVIDE YES WE ARE IN UNDER

01:01:50.807 --> 01:01:53.309
TERRITORY BUT THE BOTTOM LINE

01:01:53.376 --> 01:01:55.011
IS PEOPLE CAME INTO THIS

01:01:55.078 --> 01:01:55.578
PROFESSION BECAUSE THEY CARE

01:01:55.645 --> 01:01:57.580
ABOUT KIDS. THEY WANT TO HELP

01:01:57.647 --> 01:01:58.381
THEM LEARN AND GROW

01:01:58.448 --> 01:02:00.416
ACADEMICALLY THEY WANT TO SEE

01:02:00.483 --> 01:02:02.919
THEM THRIVE AND SURVIVE. SO I

01:02:02.985 --> 01:02:04.353
THINK THAT WE HAVE TO FIGURE

01:02:04.420 --> 01:02:06.155
OUT HOW WE MAKE SURE THAT WE

01:02:06.222 --> 01:02:08.157
ARE LISTENING TO THE PEOPLE WHO

01:02:08.224 --> 01:02:09.926
ARE IN DIRECT SERVICE TO

01:02:09.992 --> 01:02:11.461
STUDENTS DURING THIS TIME.

01:02:11.527 --> 01:02:12.762
ABOUT AS MELISSA PERSONALLY

01:02:12.829 --> 01:02:13.896
MENTIONED EARLIER I THINK WE

01:02:13.963 --> 01:02:15.565
HAVE TO REACH DOUBLE DOWN ON

01:02:15.631 --> 01:02:18.968
pHAVE TEAMS FIGURING OUT HOW TO

01:02:19.035 --> 01:02:21.637
SUPPORT KIDS- BUT THERE IS

01:02:21.704 --> 01:02:22.805
NOTHING THAT IS GOING TO

01:02:22.872 --> 01:02:24.841
REPLACE. THE INTERACTIONS OF

01:02:24.907 --> 01:02:26.342
HUMAN BEINGS WE KNEW THAT WHEN

01:02:26.409 --> 01:02:27.743
WE WERE IN PERSON AND IT'S JUST

01:02:27.810 --> 01:02:30.580
NOW BEEN AMPLIFIED. SO I HEAR

01:02:30.646 --> 01:02:33.082
THAT WE WANT TO SOLUTION ABOUT

01:02:33.149 --> 01:02:35.685
HOW TO DO THIS. I WE ARE YOU

01:02:35.751 --> 01:02:37.019
KNOW WE'RE MAKING EVERYTHING UP

01:02:37.086 --> 01:02:38.888
AS WE GO ALONG BASED ON WHAT

01:02:38.955 --> 01:02:41.257
WE- KNOW WORKS WHEN WE'RE

01:02:41.324 --> 01:02:43.226
SERVING PEOPLE IN PERSON. AND

01:02:43.292 --> 01:02:44.260
IT IS ABOUT CONNECTING WITH

01:02:44.327 --> 01:02:45.628
HUMAN BEINGS IN WHATEVER

01:02:45.695 --> 01:02:47.163
FORMATS THAT WE CAN MAKE

01:02:47.230 --> 01:02:49.298
HAPPEN. TO MAKE SURE THAT KIDS

01:02:49.365 --> 01:02:51.134
KNOW THAT THEY ARE SEEN HEARD

01:02:51.200 --> 01:02:53.236
AND VALUED AND THAT WERE THERE

01:02:53.302 --> 01:02:56.339
AND CARE ABOUT THEM. I WOULD

01:02:56.405 --> 01:02:57.673

01:05:30.760 --> 01:05:32.795
INSTANCES A LOT OF KIDS HAVEN'T

01:05:32.862 --> 01:05:34.096

EDUCATIONALLY FOR MANY MONTHS

01:05:35.965 --> 01:05:37.600
SO THEY'RE WAY WAY WAY BEHIND

01:05:37.667 --> 01:05:40.202
WHAT'S BEING DONE ON THAT SCORE

01:05:40.269 --> 01:05:41.070

STEPS AND HOW DO WE AVOID THIS

01:05:45.708 --> 01:05:50.079
HAPPENING IN THE FUTURE. SENATE

EIGHT COUNTY SUPERINTENDENTS

DEFINITELY THIS IS A

01:05:56.018 --> 01:05:58.154
CONVERSATION WE HAVE EVERY WEEK

01:05:58.220 --> 01:05:59.922

YOU LEARNED WHAT SHOULD WE

01:06:02.358 --> 01:06:04.560
MODIFY. BUT THIS IS DEFINITELY

01:06:04.627 --> 01:06:06.295
A STATEWIDE STATEWIDE

01:06:06.362 --> 01:06:08.764
CONVERSATION AND YOU KNOW I DO

01:06:08.831 --> 01:06:11.167
AGREE WITH YOU THAT THE MORE WE

01:06:11.233 --> 01:06:12.668
INTERACT AND LEARN FROM EACH

01:06:12.735 --> 01:06:14.236
OTHER AND THERE'S A LOT THAT'S

01:06:14.303 --> 01:06:15.471
GOING ON I THINK ACROSS THE

01:06:15.538 --> 01:06:18.374
STATE. SO THAT WE CAN- NOT

01:06:18.441 --> 01:06:19.775
COOKIE CUTTER HE CAN'T MAKE A

01:06:19.842 --> 01:06:21.977
COOKIE CUTTER APPROACH FROM ONE

01:06:22.044 --> 01:06:24.080
COUNTY TO ANOTHER ISSUE WELL NO

01:06:24.146 --> 01:06:25.681
BUT ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT

01:06:25.748 --> 01:06:27.516
YOU CAN WANDER AND THINK ABOUT.

01:06:27.583 --> 01:06:29.118
WHAT ARE THE LESSONS AND YOU'VE

01:06:29.185 --> 01:06:30.353
HEARD A FEW OF THEM RIGHT

01:06:30.419 --> 01:06:32.254
LISTEN CAREFULLY LISTEN

01:06:32.321 --> 01:06:33.989
CAREFULLY CHECK EVERYBODY

01:06:34.056 --> 01:06:36.926

01:06:36.992 --> 01:06:39.328
AND COMMUNICATE OFTEN. BE SURE

01:06:39.395 --> 01:06:40.830
THAT AS YOU'RE MOVING AS YOU'RE

01:06:40.896 --> 01:06:43.099
MOVING FORWARD YOU ARE PUTTING

01:06:43.165 --> 01:06:45.868
SAFETY NUMBER ONE. AND ENSURE

01:06:45.935 --> 01:06:50.139
THAT. EVERYONE HAS. A VOICE

01:06:50.206 --> 01:06:51.574
WHETHER IT BE A STUDENT A

01:06:51.640 --> 01:06:53.909
PARENT A TEACHER A CUSTODY AND-

01:06:53.976 --> 01:06:56.145
YOU KNOW WHOEVER IT YES NEEDS

01:06:56.212 --> 01:06:57.613
TO BE PART OF THIS AND THAT'S

01:06:57.680 --> 01:07:00.082
WHY WHEN YOU LOOK AT OUR

01:07:00.149 --> 01:07:02.084
SCHOOLS AND THE OPPORTUNITIES

01:07:02.151 --> 01:07:04.787
TO RE OPEN. IN PERSON THAT

01:07:04.854 --> 01:07:07.890
EVERYBODY HAS TO BE PART OF

01:07:07.957 --> 01:07:14.864
THAT CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT.

01:07:14.930 --> 01:07:16.031
IT LOOKS LIKE TO BE SAFE. I

01:07:16.098 --> 01:07:18.067
WOULD I WOULD ADAM. I THINK ONE

01:07:18.134 --> 01:07:21.470
THE MOST OF THING. IS

01:07:21.537 --> 01:07:23.506
EVERYTHING KEEPS CHANGING STILL

01:07:23.572 --> 01:07:25.474
AND HOW WE GET BETTER IN

01:07:25.541 --> 01:07:27.243
EDUCATION AND IN A CONTINUOUS

01:07:27.309 --> 01:07:29.111
IMPROVEMENT CYCLE IS BY

01:07:29.178 --> 01:07:29.879
REFLECTING ON WHAT WE'VE BEEN

01:07:29.945 --> 01:07:32.448
DOING MAKING ADJUSTMENTS AND

01:07:32.515 --> 01:07:34.650
SEEING WHAT THE IMPACT WAS AND

01:07:34.717 --> 01:07:36.352
ONE OF THE MOST DIFFICULT TIMES

01:07:36.419 --> 01:07:37.987
ABOUT IMPROVING ANYTHING THAT

01:07:38.053 --> 01:07:39.555
WE'RE DOING THIS TIME IS THAT

01:07:39.622 --> 01:07:41.624
WE KEEP HAVING TO SHIFT BASED

01:07:41.690 --> 01:07:43.125
ON OUR INVOLVING REALITY OF

01:07:43.192 --> 01:07:45.027
TRYING TO DO WHATEVER SCHOOL

01:07:45.094 --> 01:07:48.164
IS. TODAY SO I THINK THAT- YOU

01:07:48.230 --> 01:07:49.265

01:07:49.331 --> 01:07:50.533
GOING TO KNOW A LOT MORE

01:07:50.599 --> 01:07:52.668
HOPEFULLY THINGS WILL BE VERY

01:07:52.735 --> 01:07:54.770
DIFFERENT IN A YEAR FROM NOW.

01:07:54.837 --> 01:07:56.105
BUT I WILL JUST OFFERED THAT

01:07:56.172 --> 01:07:57.540

01:07:57.606 --> 01:08:00.309
DIFFICULT- ASPECTS OF THIS WORK

01:08:00.376 --> 01:08:01.544
RIGHT NOW IS THAT WE ARE

01:08:01.610 --> 01:08:02.945
CONSTANTLY HAVING TO PLAN FOR

01:08:03.012 --> 01:08:04.447
THE NEXT THING AND IT'S GIVING

01:08:04.513 --> 01:08:06.916
US VERY LITTLE TIME TO REFLECT

01:08:06.982 --> 01:08:08.350
ON WHAT WE'RE DOING RIGHT NOW.

01:08:08.417 --> 01:08:11.454

PRIVILEGE OF TRYING TO

01:33:59.467 --> 01:34:00.968
COOPERATE WITH SOME OF THEM.

01:34:01.035 --> 01:34:03.371
THEY ARE REALLY- BEING AS

01:34:03.437 --> 01:34:05.139
INNOVATIVE AS THEY CAN BE

01:34:05.206 --> 01:34:07.641
EVERYWHERE FROM FRESNO MODERATE

01:34:07.708 --> 01:34:09.477
MADERA SACRAMENTO YOU NAME IT

01:34:11.312 --> 01:34:12.980
LITTLE BIT OF HELP BUT I I'M

REALLY GRATEFUL TO BE HERE

01:34:14.515 --> 01:34:15.850
TODAY TO SHARE SOME OF MY

01:34:15.916 --> 01:34:17.985
RECOMMENDATIONS BECAUSE THEY'RE

01:34:18.052 --> 01:34:20.154
CARRYING A BURDEN THAT THEY

01:34:20.221 --> 01:34:21.889
SHOULDN'T BE AND WE REALLY NEED

01:34:21.956 --> 01:34:23.958
SOME LEGISLATIVE ACTION TO HELP

01:34:24.025 --> 01:34:27.928
NOT JUST OUR CHILDREN BUT ALL

01:34:27.995 --> 01:34:28.462
OF OUR COMMUNITIES TO HAVE

01:34:28.529 --> 01:34:29.030
ACCESS TO THE INTERNET. ONE

01:34:29.096 --> 01:34:30.097
THING IN SEAKING TO MANY OF

01:34:30.164 --> 01:34:32.166
THESE- SUPERINTENDENTS THAT WE

01:34:32.233 --> 01:34:36.137
ALL AGREE ON. IS THAT HOT SPOTS

01:34:36.203 --> 01:34:38.105
ARE A SHORT TERM SOLUTION. AS

01:34:38.172 --> 01:34:39.206
SUPERINTENDENT THURMOND

01:34:39.273 --> 01:34:40.708
MENTIONED ALTHOUGH WE WERE ABLE

01:34:40.775 --> 01:34:42.710
TO PARTNER WITH SEAT WITH THE

01:34:42.777 --> 01:34:43.744
TAX CALIFORNIA TELL CONNECT

01:34:43.811 --> 01:34:46.280
FUND. TO EXPAND OUR SOME OF THE

01:34:46.347 --> 01:34:47.782
FUNDING FOR PARTICULAR SMALL

01:34:47.848 --> 01:34:50.317
MEDIUM SCHOOLS IT'S JUST A

01:34:50.384 --> 01:34:53.487
BANDAID- THIS IS WHAT IS REALLY

01:34:53.554 --> 01:34:54.655
IMPORTANT I JUST WANT TO

01:34:54.722 --> 01:34:56.424
HIGHLIGHT SOME OF THE THINGS

01:34:56.490 --> 01:34:56.924
THAT SUPERINTEND ALREADY

01:34:56.991 --> 01:34:58.726
MENTIONED. THEY DON'T ALWAYS

01:34:58.793 --> 01:35:00.995
WORK EVERYWHERE THE HOT SPOTS

01:35:01.062 --> 01:35:02.897
AS THE NUMBER ONE PROBLEM FOR.

01:35:02.963 --> 01:35:04.432
SOME OF THE KIDS THAT WERE MOST

01:35:04.498 --> 01:35:05.766
CONCERNED ABOUT THAT ARE STILL

01:35:05.833 --> 01:35:08.302
BEING LEFT BEHIND. IN ADDITION

01:35:08.369 --> 01:35:09.837
THE SHARING OF THE DEVICES

01:35:09.904 --> 01:35:11.872
LEADS TO BANNED WITH ISSUES AND

01:35:11.939 --> 01:35:14.141
OF COURSE THE DATA CAPS IS JUST

01:35:14.208 --> 01:35:16.377
NOT A LONG TERM SOLUTION. THE

01:35:16.444 --> 01:35:17.878
REAL SOLUTION THAT I REALLY

01:35:17.945 --> 01:35:19.046
WANT TO ENGAGE ALL OF YOU TODAY

01:35:19.113 --> 01:35:21.048
IN THIS NEXT LEGISLATIVE YEAR.

01:35:21.115 --> 01:35:22.550
IS THAT WE NEED TO GOVERN THE

01:35:22.616 --> 01:35:24.051
INTERNET AS THE ESSENTIAL

01:35:24.118 --> 01:35:26.620
SERVICE THAT IT IS. IT IS A

01:35:26.687 --> 01:35:28.722
UTILITY THIS IS CENTRAL SERVICE

01:35:28.789 --> 01:35:32.493
NEEDS TO BE REGULATED LIKE ONE

01:35:32.560 --> 01:35:33.994
AND LEGISLATOR LIKE ONE.

01:35:34.061 --> 01:35:36.464
IRONICALLY WE HAVE LONG

01:35:36.530 --> 01:35:38.065
STANDING STATE AND FEDERAL LAW

01:35:38.132 --> 01:35:40.000
THAT REQUIRES OUR TELEPHONE

01:35:40.067 --> 01:35:42.203
VOICE CARRIERS FOR THE VOICE

01:35:42.269 --> 01:35:44.271
SERVICE. TO HAVE TO REALLY

01:35:44.338 --> 01:35:46.440
CRITICAL MANDATES ONE IS THAT

01:35:46.507 --> 01:35:47.608
THEY HAVE TO SERVE ALL

01:35:47.675 --> 01:35:50.211
CUSTOMERS IN A DESIGNATED AREA.

01:35:50.277 --> 01:35:52.880
WE REFER TO THIS TERM AS THE

01:35:52.947 --> 01:35:55.349
CARRIER OF LAST RESORT WE DO

01:35:55.416 --> 01:35:57.318
NOT HAVE THAT MANDATE FOR THE

01:35:57.384 --> 01:36:02.356
INTERNET AND WE DESPERATELY.

01:36:02.423 --> 01:36:02.957
NEEDED THE WE NEED. PERSONALLY

01:36:03.023 --> 01:36:03.958
I THE MOST EXPEDITIOUS AND%

01:36:04.024 --> 01:36:06.026
COMPREHENSIVE WAY TO GOVERN IN

01:36:06.093 --> 01:36:07.561
THIS APPROACH WOULD BE TO

01:36:07.628 --> 01:36:09.697
REQUIRE THAT CABLE COMPANIES TO

01:36:09.763 --> 01:36:11.599
BE THE CARRIERS OF LAST RESORT

01:36:11.665 --> 01:36:14.068
IN THEIR DESIGNATED AREAS. SO

01:36:14.135 --> 01:36:15.870
THAT ALL CUSTOMERS HAVE THE

01:36:15.936 --> 01:36:17.438
INTERNET SERVICE VAILABLE TO

01:36:17.505 --> 01:36:19.206
THEM AND TO HAVE IT AT AN

01:36:19.273 --> 01:36:21.609
AFFORDABLE RATE. AS I MENTIONED

01:36:21.675 --> 01:36:25.546
ALSO HISTORICALLY AND NOW

01:36:25.613 --> 01:36:26.514
TELEPHONE VOICE CARRIERS HAVE

01:36:26.580 --> 01:36:28.649
THE MANDATE OF CARRIER OF LAST

01:36:28.716 --> 01:36:29.617
RESORT. BUT THEY'RE ALSO

01:36:29.683 --> 01:36:31.819
MANDATED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE

01:36:31.886 --> 01:36:33.821
CALIFORNIA LIFELINE PROGRAM

01:36:33.888 --> 01:36:36.724
WHICH PROVIDES AFFORDABLE PLANS

01:36:36.790 --> 01:36:39.093
FOR VOICE. NO SUCH MANDATE

01:36:39.160 --> 01:36:41.795
EXISTS FOR INTERNET SERVICE

01:36:41.862 --> 01:36:44.031
PROVIDERS. THESE PROTECTIONS TO

01:36:44.098 --> 01:36:46.667
OBLIGATE TO SERVE AND TO HAVE

01:36:46.734 --> 01:36:48.068
AFFORDABLE PLANS FOR LOW INCOME

01:36:48.135 --> 01:36:51.505
CUSTOMERS. DON'T EXIST IN THE

01:36:51.572 --> 01:36:53.607
INTERNET SPACE BECAUSE WE HAVE

01:36:53.674 --> 01:36:55.509
USED ALLOWS A FAIR APPROACH FOR

01:36:55.576 --> 01:36:57.378
THE LAST COUPLE DECADES THAT

01:36:57.444 --> 01:36:59.747
THE FREE MARKET FREE OF THESE

01:36:59.813 --> 01:37:01.715
TYPES OF OBLIGATION WAS GONNA

01:37:01.782 --> 01:37:05.653
SOMEHOW ADDRESS THESE- ON THESE

01:37:05.719 --> 01:37:07.555
DISPARITIES THAT EXISTED. IN

01:37:07.621 --> 01:37:08.756
FACT THEY'VE CAUSED A GREATER

01:37:08.822 --> 01:37:11.725
DISPARITY. AS AN EXAMPLE JUST

01:37:11.792 --> 01:37:12.860
WANNA SHARE RECENT-

01:37:12.927 --> 01:37:14.028
INTERACTIONS THAT WE'VE HAD

01:37:14.094 --> 01:37:16.430
WITH EIGHTEEN T. ON THEIR

01:37:16.497 --> 01:37:19.133
FUTURE TO INVESTING COMMUNITIES

01:37:19.200 --> 01:37:20.901
AND THEY'VE BEEN VERY CLEAR

01:37:20.968 --> 01:37:22.536
THAT THEY PLAN TO RETIRE THEIR

01:37:22.603 --> 01:37:25.639
DSL SERVICE AND THAT THEY HAVE

01:37:25.706 --> 01:37:27.908
NO REAL UPGRADES TO AGREE THAT

01:37:27.975 --> 01:37:30.244
DSL TO FIBER ESPECIALLY NOT IN

01:37:30.311 --> 01:37:32.580
THE AREAS WHERE DOESN'T ALREADY

01:37:32.646 --> 01:37:34.882
EXIST. IN SOME AREAS WHAT

01:37:34.949 --> 01:37:37.651
THEY'RE PROPOSING IS TO PROVIDE

01:37:37.718 --> 01:37:40.554
NON FIXED INTERNET SERVICE AND

01:37:40.621 --> 01:37:41.922
THIS IS A WIRELESS BROADBAND

01:37:41.989 --> 01:37:43.624
SERVICE WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT

01:37:43.691 --> 01:37:44.858
THAT'S A SUBSTITUTE FOR

01:37:44.925 --> 01:37:47.027
WIRELINE INTERNET SERVICE FOR

01:37:47.094 --> 01:37:48.963
MUCH OF THE SAME REASONS THAT I

01:37:49.029 --> 01:37:50.431
MENTION WITH THE HOT SPOTS.

01:37:50.497 --> 01:37:52.199
SOME AREAS OF CALIFORNIA WILL

01:37:52.266 --> 01:37:55.869
BE LEFT WITH NOTHING NO ALL DSL

01:37:55.936 --> 01:37:59.206
NO FIBER UPGRADES NO CABLE AND

01:37:59.273 --> 01:38:02.109
NO MOBILE WIRELESS WE NEED TO

01:38:02.176 --> 01:38:03.944
ADDRESS THE SAME WE DESPERATELY

01:38:04.011 --> 01:38:05.779
NEED THE LEGISLATURE TO ACT.

01:38:05.846 --> 01:38:08.282
STUDY AFTER STUDY HAS FOUND

01:38:08.349 --> 01:38:10.317
THAT COMPANIES LIKE AT&amp;T AND

01:38:10.384 --> 01:38:12.419
COMCAST ARE RED LINING

01:38:12.486 --> 01:38:14.722
COMMUNITIES BOTH RURAL AND

01:38:14.788 --> 01:38:16.824
URBAN BECAUSE THEY HAVE NO

01:38:16.890 --> 01:38:18.492
OBLIGATION TO SERVE THE ENTIRE

01:38:18.559 --> 01:38:21.095
COMMUNITY. A RECENT REPORT FROM

01:38:21.161 --> 01:38:22.896
THE NATIONAL DIGITAL INCLUSION

01:38:22.963 --> 01:38:25.566
ASSOCIATION FOUND THIS PROBLEM

01:38:25.633 --> 01:38:27.801
TO BE NATION WIDE FOR A. T. AND

01:38:27.868 --> 01:38:29.770
T. THE MEDIAN INCOME FOR

01:38:29.837 --> 01:38:32.273
HOUSEHOLDS WITH ACCESS TO FIBER

01:38:32.339 --> 01:38:35.042
WAS 34% HIGHER. AND THEN IN THE

01:38:35.109 --> 01:38:38.145
AREAS WITH DSL ONLY. AN IN

01:38:38.212 --> 01:38:40.547
CALIFORNIA AT AND T. IS ONLY

01:38:40.614 --> 01:38:43.784
DEPLOYING FIBER 210% OR LESS

01:38:43.851 --> 01:38:46.086
HOUSEHOLDS IN RURAL COUNTIES

01:38:46.153 --> 01:38:48.622
SUCH AS KINGS TO WARY AND

01:38:48.689 --> 01:38:50.724
MADERA. ANOTHER STUDY BY THE

01:38:50.791 --> 01:38:52.393
ANNENBERG RESEARCH NETWORK ON

01:38:52.459 --> 01:38:54.895
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNICATIONS

01:38:54.962 --> 01:38:57.598
WERE USC RESEARCHER AND NONE. I

01:38:57.665 --> 01:39:00.334
GOT BUILDING. THIS LAST YEAR

01:39:00.401 --> 01:39:03.003
DID A STUDY ON WHO GETS ACCESS

01:39:03.070 --> 01:39:04.838
TO FAST BROADBAND IN LOS

01:39:04.905 --> 01:39:07.207
ANGELES COUNTY. THE FINDING

01:39:07.274 --> 01:39:09.243
INDICATED THAT FIBER SERVICES

01:39:09.310 --> 01:39:11.378
ARE LESS LIKELY TO BE OFFERED

01:39:11.445 --> 01:39:12.379
IN LOW INCOME AREAS WITH

01:39:12.446 --> 01:39:14.648
COMMUNITIES OF COLOR WITH THE

01:39:14.715 --> 01:39:17.251
MOST SEVERE DEFICITS IN AREAS

01:39:17.318 --> 01:39:18.519
THAT HAVE BLACK RESIDENTS

01:39:18.585 --> 01:39:21.255
LIVING IN POVERTY. IN JUNE OF

01:39:21.322 --> 01:39:23.223
THIS YEAR ANOTHER STUDY BY

01:39:23.290 --> 01:39:24.758
GREEN LIGHTING THE GREEN LINING

01:39:24.825 --> 01:39:27.027
INSTITUTE THEY SHARED THEIR

01:39:27.094 --> 01:39:28.996
FINDINGS OF COMMUNITIES IN AND

NEAR OAKLAND LACKING HIGH SPEED

01:39:31.699 --> 01:39:33.901
INTERNET ACCESS AND IT CLOSELY

01:39:33.967 --> 01:39:35.235
RESEMBLED A MAP OF THE

01:39:35.302 --> 01:39:38.205
REDLINING THAT OCCURRED IN

01:39:38.272 --> 01:39:38.739
HOUSING FROM THE NINETEEN

01:39:38.806 --> 01:39:40.808
THIRTIES. HERE AT THE DO YOU

01:39:40.874 --> 01:39:43.210
SEE AS I MENTIONED WE HEAR FROM

01:39:43.277 --> 01:39:45.245
INDIVIDUAL COMMUNITIES ALL THE

01:39:45.312 --> 01:39:47.448
TIME IN THESE LAST TWO WEEKS

01:39:47.514 --> 01:39:48.949
ALONE I PERSONALLY HAVE MET

01:39:49.016 --> 01:39:50.918
WITH COMMUNITIES IN CINEMA

01:39:50.984 --> 01:39:53.554
COUNTY. MENDOCINO COUNTY

01:39:53.620 --> 01:39:57.224
MONTEREY COUNTY FRESNO COUNTY

01:39:57.291 --> 01:39:59.226
AND COMMUNITIES ALL IN BETWEEN

01:39:59.293 --> 01:40:01.295
AND THE ISSUES RUN THE GAMUT

01:40:01.362 --> 01:40:03.464
MOST OF THE TIME THERE'S FIBER

01:40:03.530 --> 01:40:04.998
GOING THROUGH THE COMMUNITY AND

01:40:05.065 --> 01:40:07.201
THEY HAVE NO ACCESS OR THE

01:40:07.267 --> 01:40:09.603
FIBER GOES WITH ANY CABLE

01:40:09.670 --> 01:40:11.138
SERVICE HALF OF THE COMMUNITIES

01:40:11.205 --> 01:40:13.440
LIKE HIM BY ALLAH. AND THE

01:40:13.507 --> 01:40:15.109
OTHER HALF DOESN'T HAVE IT. OR

01:40:15.175 --> 01:40:16.543
LIKE THE COMMUNITY AND SIGNED

01:40:16.610 --> 01:40:18.011
HER ARE THE MONTEREY WAS

01:40:18.078 --> 01:40:20.280
SHOWING SERVICE BUT THE

01:40:20.347 --> 01:40:22.383
COMMUNITY DOESN'T HAVE IT. ALL

01:40:22.449 --> 01:40:23.584
OF THESE COMMUNITIES HAVE

01:40:23.650 --> 01:40:25.853
CHILDREN CHILDREN ARE FALLING

01:40:25.919 --> 01:40:27.688
BEHIND AND THE SUPERINTENDENTS

01:40:27.755 --> 01:40:29.556
ARE TRYING TO DO EVERYTHING

01:40:29.623 --> 01:40:32.359
POSSIBLE TO GET IT. RESOLVED

01:40:32.426 --> 01:40:36.663
BUT THEY CANNOT DO IT ALONE.

01:40:36.730 --> 01:40:38.832
THIS IS A YOU KNOW WE COME TO A

01:40:38.899 --> 01:40:41.168
POINT HERE WHERE WE HAVE. THE

01:40:41.235 --> 01:40:42.936
TRIED AN APPROACH OF OFFERING

01:40:43.003 --> 01:40:45.105
INCENTIVES AND USING THE MARKET

01:40:45.172 --> 01:40:46.573
FORCES TO TRY TO CLOSE THE

01:40:46.640 --> 01:40:48.709
DIGITAL DIVIDE BUT WE'RE PAST

01:40:48.776 --> 01:40:50.577
THAT POINT WE NEED TO REQUIRE

01:40:50.644 --> 01:40:53.046
THESE COMMUNITIES TO BE SERVED

01:40:53.113 --> 01:40:53.914
AND THAT THEY BE SERVED THE

01:40:53.981 --> 01:40:55.783
SAME QUALITY AT AN AFFORDABLE

01:40:55.849 --> 01:41:02.022
RATE. IT'S TOO LATE IT'S TOO IS

01:41:02.089 --> 01:41:03.056
JUST INSUFFICIENT NOW TO. ON A

01:41:03.123 --> 01:41:05.192
ALONE IN TWO THOUSAND AND SIX

01:41:05.259 --> 01:41:06.693

01:41:09.229 --> 01:41:11.598
DIFFICULT. THE CHANGE IT CHANGE

ACCESS. LONG TERM IT'S

01:50:47.941 --> 01:50:49.342
DIFFICULT FOR US TO SUBSIDIZE

01:50:49.409 --> 01:50:51.845
THOSE SORTS OF PROGRAMS. I WANT

01:50:51.911 --> 01:50:52.345
TO TALK A LITTLE ABOUT

01:50:52.412 --> 01:50:54.514
PERFORMANCE BECAUSE I MENTIONED

01:50:54.581 --> 01:50:56.349
FIBER TO THE HOME THE

01:50:56.416 --> 01:50:56.950
IMPORTANCE OF THE PERFORMANCE

01:50:57.017 --> 01:50:59.486
OF FIBER. HAS REALLY BEEN SHOWN

01:50:59.552 --> 01:51:03.623
BY THIS PANDEMIC. AND WE SAW AT

01:51:03.690 --> 01:51:06.993
THE START OF SHELTER IN PLACE A

01:51:07.060 --> 01:51:08.395
THIRTY. A PERCENT INCREASE

01:51:08.461 --> 01:51:10.730
ALMOST OVERNIGHT IN THE

CONSUMPTION OF INBOUND USAGE-

01:51:14.100 --> 01:51:16.403
AND BETWEEN FORTY AND 50%

01:51:16.469 --> 01:51:19.472
INCREASE IN OUTBOUND. AND SO

01:51:19.539 --> 01:51:21.241
YOU THINK ABOUT YOU KNOW SORT

01:51:21.307 --> 01:51:25.378
OF BASELINE PERFORMANCE OF A

01:51:25.445 --> 01:51:25.912
TWENTY FIVE DOWN THREE UP

01:51:25.979 --> 01:51:28.848
PRODUCT. AND A SINGLE ZOOM

01:51:28.915 --> 01:51:32.252
GROUP CALL REQUIRES BETWEEN ONE

01:51:32.318 --> 01:51:32.852
AND A HALF IN TWO AND A HALF

01:51:32.919 --> 01:51:35.188
MEGABITS. AND I HAVE THREE

01:51:35.255 --> 01:51:36.523
YOUNG CHILDREN MY WIFE AND I

01:51:36.589 --> 01:51:37.991
ARE ALSO LUCKY ENOUGH TO BE

01:51:38.058 --> 01:51:39.392
ABLE TO WORK FROM HOME GIVEN

01:51:39.459 --> 01:51:41.127
THE INDUSTRIES THAT WERE IN.

01:51:41.194 --> 01:51:42.629
AND THERE ARE TIMES WHEN ALL

01:51:42.695 --> 01:51:44.964
FIVE OF US- ON ZOOM TEAMS HANG

01:51:45.031 --> 01:51:48.868
OUT MEET AT CETERA AND- AND SO

01:51:48.935 --> 01:51:50.336
A LOT MORE UPSTREAM BANDWIDTH

01:51:50.403 --> 01:51:52.806
IS NEEDED. AS AN IMPORTANT

01:51:52.872 --> 01:51:55.208
RECOGNITION YOU KNOW AS THESE

01:51:55.275 --> 01:51:57.710
TECHNOLOGIES HAVE EVOLVED I

01:51:57.777 --> 01:51:58.344
THINK THE FUTURE OF WORK IN THE

01:51:58.411 --> 01:51:59.913
FUTURE OF LEARNING. YOU KNOW

01:51:59.979 --> 01:52:01.047
I'M TRYING TO TAKE THE MOST

01:52:01.114 --> 01:52:03.416
OPTIMISTIC VIEW ABOUT THE

01:52:03.483 --> 01:52:04.818
CHANGES THAT THIS PANDEMIC HAS

01:52:04.884 --> 01:52:07.787
BROUGHT. AND ONE OF THOSE IS

01:52:07.854 --> 01:52:08.922
THAT YOU KNOW WE MAY BE ABLE

01:52:08.988 --> 01:52:11.224
TO. WORK FROM HOME MORE AND

01:52:11.291 --> 01:52:11.991
HAVE MORE FLEXIBLE WORKING

01:52:12.058 --> 01:52:14.594
ENVIRONMENTS- AND WE MIDDLE

01:52:14.661 --> 01:52:16.162
SUPPORT STUDENTS WHO HAVE A

01:52:16.229 --> 01:52:19.866
VARIETY OF NEEDS. BY SUPPORTING

01:52:19.933 --> 01:52:23.403
THEM AT A DISTANCE SO I ONE

01:52:23.470 --> 01:52:24.971
TOLD ABOUT KIND OF THE TWO

01:52:25.038 --> 01:52:25.972
BROAD CATEGORIES THAT WE THINK

01:52:26.039 --> 01:52:30.143
ABOUT- IN REGARDS TO CONNECTING

01:52:30.210 --> 01:52:30.677
HOUSEHOLDS AND CONNECTING

01:52:30.743 --> 01:52:33.913
STUDENTS THE FIRST IS. I THINK

01:52:33.980 --> 01:52:35.248
THE ONE THAT GETS THE MOST

01:52:35.315 --> 01:52:36.716
ATTENTION THAT IS DEPLOYMENT.

01:52:36.783 --> 01:52:39.486
THE RURAL PROBLEM- THE SMALL

01:52:39.552 --> 01:52:40.954
PERCENTAGE OF HOUSEHOLDS IN

01:52:41.020 --> 01:52:42.789
CALIFORNIA WHO HAVE NO INTERNET

01:52:42.856 --> 01:52:44.991
ACCESS AVAILABLE OR FOR WHOM

01:52:45.058 --> 01:52:47.760
THE INTERNET ACCESS IS JUST.

01:52:47.827 --> 01:52:49.395
INSUFFICIENTLY SLOW AND SO THAT

01:52:49.462 --> 01:52:54.067
MIGHT BE A VERY OLD DSL SYSTEM.

01:52:54.134 --> 01:52:55.535
FOR NOTHING EVER. AND TESE

01:52:55.602 --> 01:52:58.037
AREAS YOU KNOW THESE ARE A

01:52:58.104 --> 01:53:00.140
CHALLENGE PRIMARILY OF SUBSIDY

01:53:00.206 --> 01:53:01.975
IT IS A FINANCIAL CHALLENGE HOW

01:53:02.041 --> 01:53:03.676
DO YOU CONVINCE CARES TO GO

01:53:03.743 --> 01:53:06.312
BUILD. A TO FAR FLUNG LOCATIONS

01:53:06.379 --> 01:53:07.413
WHERE IS THERE IS NO CLEAR

01:53:07.480 --> 01:53:10.483
RETURN ON INVESTMENT. AND I'VE

01:53:10.550 --> 01:53:12.485
SEEN REFORMS IN THE CASF

01:53:12.552 --> 01:53:14.053
PROGRAMMING CERTAINLY ENCOURAGE

01:53:14.120 --> 01:53:15.722
THE STATE TO CONTINUE TO COMMIT

01:53:15.788 --> 01:53:18.424
TO. A PROGRAMS LIKE CASF AND

01:53:18.491 --> 01:53:21.895
OTHER GRANT PROGRAMS. THAT

01:53:21.961 --> 01:53:25.231
WOULD REACH THOSE RURAL MARKETS.

01:53:25.298 --> 01:53:26.666
IN THOSE THERE CONTINUE TO BE

01:53:26.733 --> 01:53:28.635
PROBLEMS THOUGH BEARS AND

01:53:28.701 --> 01:53:30.570
DEPLOYMENT YOU KNOW ISSUES

01:53:30.637 --> 01:53:32.172
AROUND LOCAL PERMITTING-

01:53:32.238 --> 01:53:34.274
UTILITY STANDARDS LIKE

01:53:34.340 --> 01:53:35.842
DIRECTIONAL BORING IN MICRO

01:53:35.909 --> 01:53:37.510
TRENCHING ARE ESSENTIAL POLL

01:53:37.577 --> 01:53:39.879
SAFETY AND ONE TOUCH MAKE READY

01:53:39.946 --> 01:53:42.148
ACCESS TO UTILITY POLES ARE

01:53:42.215 --> 01:53:44.951
ESSENTIAL TABLE STAKES BEFORE

01:53:45.018 --> 01:53:45.518
YOU INVEST IN THOSE SORTS OF

01:53:45.585 --> 01:53:48.421
PROGRAMS. SONIC THOUGH IS

01:53:48.488 --> 01:53:49.756
FOCUSED ON THE URBAN AND

01:53:49.822 --> 01:53:52.492
SUBURBAN DEPLOYMENT TODAY WE-

01:53:52.559 --> 01:53:54.928
DO NOT- HAVE NOT BUILT ANY

01:53:54.994 --> 01:53:56.829
RURAL MARKETS AND WE HAVEN'T

01:53:56.896 --> 01:53:57.964
PURCHASED IT IN ANY OF THE

01:53:58.031 --> 01:53:59.766
SUBSIDY PROGRAMS WOULD REALLY

01:53:59.832 --> 01:54:00.967
STRUGGLE TO FIND A BUSINESS

01:54:01.034 --> 01:54:02.435
MODEL AROUND THOSE THAT WOULD

01:54:02.502 --> 01:54:04.170
ALLOW US AS A PRIVATE ENTITY.

01:54:04.237 --> 01:54:05.772
THE BILL NETWORK INTO THOSE FAR

01:54:05.838 --> 01:54:07.106
FLUNG IN VERY CHALLENGING

01:54:07.173 --> 01:54:09.676
ENVIRONMENTS I REALLY APPLAUD

01:54:09.742 --> 01:54:10.276
THE CARES THAT HAVE SUCCEEDED

01:54:10.343 --> 01:54:13.446
NOT. AS WE THINK ABOUT URBAN

01:54:13.513 --> 01:54:15.748
AND SUBURBAN ENVIRONMENTS.

01:54:15.815 --> 01:54:16.649
GENERALLY THERE IS SOME FORM

01:54:16.716 --> 01:54:19.719
ACCESS IT MIGHT BE A PRE

01:54:19.786 --> 01:54:22.822
EXISTING DSL OR A FIBRE TO THE

01:54:22.889 --> 01:54:25.325
NODE PRODUCTS OR IT MIGHT BE A

01:54:25.391 --> 01:54:27.393
HYBRID FIBRE COAXIAL CABLE

01:54:27.460 --> 01:54:30.797
SYSTEM OTHER MENU MEDIA A FIBER

01:54:30.863 --> 01:54:32.832
IN SOME LOCATIONS. IN THOSE

01:54:32.899 --> 01:54:35.335
LOCATIONS OF URBAN LOCATIONS WE

01:54:35.401 --> 01:54:37.737
ACTUALLY HAVE MORE UNCONNECTED

01:54:37.804 --> 01:54:39.672
HOUSEHOLDS AND MORE UNCONNECTED

01:54:39.739 --> 01:54:43.209
STUDENTS THAN WE DO IN THE

01:54:43.276 --> 01:54:43.810
RURAL MARKETS WHERE THEY HAVE

01:54:43.876 --> 01:54:45.478
NO CHOICE TO CONNECT. ADOPTION

01:54:45.545 --> 01:54:46.646
IS A CRITICAL ISSUE THAT

01:54:46.713 --> 01:54:51.284
IS A MORE COMPLEX PROBLEM

01:54:51.351 --> 01:54:54.487
DEPLOYMENT PROBLEM IS- YOU KNOW

01:54:54.554 --> 01:54:57.056
IT IS A CHALLENGING ONE IT'S AN

01:54:57.123 --> 01:54:57.657
EXPENSIVE ONE THAT'S WHY IT'S

01:54:57.724 --> 01:54:59.659
CHALLENGING. BUT THE ADOPTION

01:54:59.726 --> 01:55:01.027
ISSUE IS MORE COMPLEX IN OTHER

01:55:01.094 --> 01:55:02.528
WORDS WHEN THEY'RE TWO OR THREE

01:55:02.595 --> 01:55:04.931
CARRIERS OFFERING A SERVICE TO

01:55:04.998 --> 01:55:07.700
A HOME AND URBAN MARKET. WHY DO

01:55:07.767 --> 01:55:10.036
WE CAN TO HAVE ROUGHLY 20% OF

01:55:10.103 --> 01:55:12.205
HOMES IN URBAN MARKETS NOT

01:55:12.272 --> 01:55:15.675
CONNECTED. AND COST IS REALLY A

01:55:15.742 --> 01:55:19.279
KEY FACTOR THERE- SO THERE ARE

01:55:19.345 --> 01:55:21.948
TWO PRIMARY FACTORSCOST. AND

01:55:22.015 --> 01:55:23.816
EDUCATION ACCESS TO DEVICES

01:55:23.883 --> 01:55:27.353
ACOSTA- IT ENCOMPASSES DEVICES

01:55:27.420 --> 01:55:30.790
AND EQUIPMENT- THE

01:55:30.857 --> 01:55:31.357
AFFORDABILITY THE CONNECTION

01:55:31.424 --> 01:55:34.761
ITSELF WHERE EDUCATION HOW WHY

01:55:34.827 --> 01:55:36.763
DO I WANT THIS HOW WILL I USE

01:55:36.829 --> 01:55:39.799
IT. AND THE- YOU KNOW

01:55:39.866 --> 01:55:41.100
SUPPORTING THE PARENTS AND

01:55:41.167 --> 01:55:45.271
STUDENTS AS TO- THE KNOWLEDGE

01:55:45.338 --> 01:55:45.805
ABOUT THEM THE USE OF THE

01:55:45.872 --> 01:55:49.776
CONNECTIONS. AND AS A AS A

01:55:49.842 --> 01:55:52.345
COMPETITIVE CARRIER. WHAT WE

01:55:52.412 --> 01:55:54.547
OBSERVE IS THAT THE MORE

01:55:54.614 --> 01:55:55.114
COMPETITION YOU HAVE IN THE

01:55:55.181 --> 01:55:57.550
MARKETPLACE. THE HIGHER THE

01:55:57.617 --> 01:55:59.319
PERFORMANCE OF THE SERVICES.

01:55:59.385 --> 01:56:00.953
AND THE LOWER THE COST OF THOSE

01:56:01.020 --> 01:56:02.655
SERVICES AND CRITICALLY EASY

01:56:02.722 --> 01:56:04.724
THINK ABOUT AN ENVIRONMENT WITH

01:56:04.791 --> 01:56:05.858
DISTANCE LEARNING AND WORK FROM

01:56:05.925 --> 01:56:08.828
HOME. HAVING HIGHER THAN TWENTY

01:56:08.895 --> 01:56:10.730
FIVE DOWN AND THREE MEGABITS UP

01:56:10.797 --> 01:56:13.032
IS IMPORTANT. AND WHERE YOU

01:56:13.099 --> 01:56:15.368
HAVE SLOW LEGACY TECHNOLOGIES

01:56:15.435 --> 01:56:17.970
DEPLOYED YOU'D REALLY LIKE TO

DEPLOYMENT WE EXPERIENCE MANY

01:56:28.014 --> 01:56:29.649
BEARS TO THAT APPOINTMENT OF

02:11:35.787 --> 02:11:37.589
COMMUNITIES IN WHICH THIS FIBER

02:11:37.656 --> 02:11:39.391
GOES THROUGH OUT YET THEY WON'T

02:11:39.458 --> 02:11:40.859
FIGHT IN NOT ALLOW WORKING

02:11:40.926 --> 02:11:43.295
ACTIVITY. IN THOSE COMMUNITIES

02:11:43.362 --> 02:11:45.897
I SAY ALL THAT IS I AGREE WITH

02:11:45.964 --> 02:11:47.566
MS MCINTYRE NEWS MCINTYRE'S

02:11:47.633 --> 02:11:49.501
ALWAYS PUT HERSELF AT THE TABLE

02:11:49.568 --> 02:11:50.736
AND I DO WANT TO SAY THANK YOU

02:11:50.802 --> 02:11:51.203

02:11:58.844 --> 02:11:59.778
THAT WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO EASE

OUR COMMUNITIES BUT IN RETURN I

02:12:09.321 --> 02:12:10.455
DO BELIEVE THAT WE NEED TO MAKE

02:12:10.522 --> 02:12:13.158
IT EASIER FOR RURAL COMMUNITIES

02:12:13.225 --> 02:12:15.794

PROGRAM THEIR OWN PROGRAM THEY

02:12:20.198 --> 02:12:21.800
LOOK LIKE A WIDE FIRE BROADBAND

02:12:21.867 --> 02:12:23.368
DISTRICTS VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT

02:12:23.435 --> 02:12:25.370
WE HAVE WITH SEWER AND WATER

ARE AREA ON THE NORTH COAST.

02:12:50.629 --> 02:12:51.697

AND SATELLITE IS INCREDIBLY.

02:12:58.203 --> 02:12:59.771
WE'RE CURRENTLY WORKING WITH

02:12:59.838 --> 02:13:01.373
THE GOVERNMENT EDUCATION TO BE

02:13:01.440 --> 02:13:03.075
ABLE TO NEGOTIATE A RATE VERY

02:13:03.141 --> 02:13:04.676
SIMILAR TO WHAT COMCAST IS DONE

COMCAST ESSENTIAL PROGRAM

02:13:11.083 --> 02:13:12.384
PROVIDING. LOW INCOME FAMILIES

THROUGHOUT THIS PANDEMIC. BUT

02:13:20.392 --> 02:13:22.461
WE ALSO ARE FOCUSED ON A NON

02:13:22.527 --> 02:13:24.262
REGULATED UTILITY THAT WE HAVE.

02:13:24.329 --> 02:13:27.032

BUT TO GET RETURNED A

02:13:33.638 --> 02:13:35.674
SATELLITE. THAT WE ARE GOING TO

02:13:35.741 --> 02:13:37.008
BAT IN THIS WHILE YOU CAN

02:13:37.075 --> 02:13:38.243

THERE IS- AN INCREDIBLE.

02:13:49.788 --> 02:13:52.724
FRUSTRATION IN FACT DOWNRIGHT

02:13:52.791 --> 02:13:54.526
ANGER AT TIMES. THAT WE KEEP

02:13:54.593 --> 02:13:55.794
TALKING ABOUT THIS WE KNOW WHAT

02:13:55.861 --> 02:13:57.996
THE SOLUTIONS ARE BUT LIKE.

02:13:58.063 --> 02:14:00.132
THIS ONE INSTEAD- WE LET THE

02:14:00.198 --> 02:14:01.700
POLITICS GET IN THE WAY OF THE

02:14:01.767 --> 02:14:03.435
GOOD. AND I THINK YOU SO MUCH

OF YOUR FRUSTRATION AND WE NEED

02:14:10.742 --> 02:14:11.510
TO FIGURE OUT SOLUTIONS AND

02:14:11.576 --> 02:14:12.277
THAT'S CERTAINLY WHY WE'RE

02:14:12.344 --> 02:14:14.913
HERE- BUT WILL OPEN THAT UP TO

02:14:14.980 --> 02:14:16.014

TO SPEAK ON IT I'M HAPPY TO

02:14:29.928 --> 02:14:31.696
STATE HERE THAT WOULD RESHAPE

02:14:31.763 --> 02:14:34.132
IT SENATORS CANDOR- THAT THIS

02:14:34.199 --> 02:14:34.800
IS BEEN A MATTER OF BOTH

02:14:34.866 --> 02:14:37.002
POLITICS AND ABOUT A LACK OF

02:14:37.068 --> 02:14:38.770
INVESTMENT IN CALIFORNIA

02:14:38.837 --> 02:14:39.704
COMMUNITIES IT IS HEART

02:14:39.771 --> 02:14:41.706
BREAKING THAT THERE ARE

02:14:41.773 --> 02:14:42.441
COMPANIES THAT SIMPLY WILL NOT

02:14:42.507 --> 02:14:44.075
INVEST IN RULE COMMUNITIES

02:14:44.142 --> 02:14:45.343
BECAUSE THEY DON'T THINK THAT

02:14:45.410 --> 02:14:47.078
THE POPULATION IS BROAD ENOUGH

02:14:47.145 --> 02:14:48.146
FOR THEM TO IT WOULD BE

02:14:48.213 --> 02:14:49.781
PROFITABLE AND SO THAT MEANS

02:14:49.848 --> 02:14:50.916
WE'VE ALLOWED CALIFORNIANS TO

02:14:50.982 --> 02:14:52.117
GO ABOUT SOMETHING THEY NEED

02:14:52.184 --> 02:14:53.885
NOT JUST FOR THE PANDEMIC WE

02:14:53.952 --> 02:14:54.719
WANT OUR STUDENTS TO BE READY

02:14:54.786 --> 02:14:55.921
FOR THE JOBS OF TOMORROW WE

02:14:55.987 --> 02:14:56.888
WANT THEM TO BE THE COMPUTER

SCIENTISTS AND ENGINEERS. AND

02:14:58.890 --> 02:15:00.091
THAT BE HEALTH EXPERTS AND HAVE

02:15:00.158 --> 02:15:01.893

INSTRUCTION AND SO WE'RE

02:15:08.333 --> 02:15:09.167
COMMITTED TO WHAT THE SENATORS

02:15:09.234 --> 02:15:10.936

02:15:11.002 --> 02:15:12.637
KINDS OF OPTIONS INCLUDING

02:15:12.704 --> 02:15:14.439
INCLUDING SATELLITE WE THINK

02:15:14.506 --> 02:15:15.907
THAT THERE ARE SOME POTENTIAL

02:15:15.974 --> 02:15:17.576
OPPORTUNITIES THERE IT IS VERY

02:15:17.642 --> 02:15:19.511
VERY EXPENSIVE- BUT WE THINK

02:15:19.578 --> 02:15:20.312
THAT THERE ARE SOME

02:15:20.378 --> 02:15:22.113
OPPORTUNITIES AND AGAIN WE WANT

02:15:22.180 --> 02:15:23.648

HEARING YOU SAY IS THAT. YOUR

02:22:24.235 --> 02:22:26.104

THAT CURRENTLY OPERATE THE

02:23:31.970 --> 02:23:34.839
STATE. PLUS AND THE ENVIRONMENT

02:23:34.906 --> 02:23:36.774
