WITH THE FIRST BEING FILE NUMBER ONE ASSEMBLY BILL ONE ZERO ZERO NINE BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER BLUE MISCIBLE MARKHAM TO ASSEMBLY AGRICULTURE. AND WE ARE READY WHEN YOU ARE. THANK YOU GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIRMAN COLLEAGUES IT'S GOOD TO BE HERE AND I AM PLEASED TO BE PRESENTING A. B. ONE ZERO ZERO NINE WHICH ESTABLISHES THE FARM TO SCHOOL FOOD HUB PROGRAM WITHIN THE OFFICE OF FARM TO FORK IN THE DEPARTMENT OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE. AND PROPOSES FUNDING FOR A REGIONAL PILOT PROGRAM TO ESTABLISH THREE FARM TO SCHOOL FOOD HUBS IN NORTHERN. CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY FOOD JOBS THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES. THE MAJORITY OF WHICH ARE LOCATED ON THE EASTERN SEABOARD IN CALIFORNIA. CURRENTLY HAS- AROUND FIFTEEN WHICH OPERATE AT DIFFERENT SCALES AND A MORE CONCENTRATED IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. FOOD HAVE OFFER A REGIONALISED APPROACH TO FOOD DISTRIBUTION THAT HAS PROVEN TO BE A SUCCESSFUL MODEL FOR PROMOTING DIRECT FARM AND RANCH SALES TO LOCAL COMMUNITIES. THE COVERED NINETEEN PANDEMIC HAS RESULTED IN THE UNPREDICTABILITY AND LOSS OF MARKETS WHICH HAS HAD A DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACT ON CALIFORNIA'S SMALL SCALE FARMERS. PARTICULARLY THOSE WHO ARE HISTORICALLY UNDERSERVED FARMERS OF COLOR. FOOD SYSTEM REFORM INCREASINGLY CALLS FOR MORE REGIONALIZED FOOD SYSTEMS. WHICH IN TURN PROVIDE GREATER RESILIENCE IN TIMES OF NATURAL OR PUBLIC HEALTH DISASTER. DURING THE PANDEMIC THOSE AREAS THAT HAD COMMUNITY FACING FOOD HUBS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO PIVOT QUICKLY TOWARD REDIRECTING THEIR SUPPLY CHANGE TO AREAS OF NEED. AN EXCELLENT EXAMPLE OF THE SUCCESS OF THIS MODEL IS THE COMMON MARKET. A NONPROFIT FOOD HUB OPERATING IN PHILADELPHIA NEW YORK GEORGIA AND TEXAS WHICH PROVIDED SUPPORT FOR LOCAL FARMERS AND EMERGENCY FOOD RELIEF DURING THE PANDEMIC. WELL CALIFORNIA LEADS THE NATION IN AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION WITH THE FARM ECONOMY VALUED AT FIFTY BILLION DOLLARS. UNFORTUNATELY WE LAG BEHIND IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF REGIONAL IS FOOD SYSTEMS WHICH REQUIRE CAPITAL INVESTMENT IN AGGREGATION AND DISTRIBUTION INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDED TO INCREASE PURCHASING OF LOCAL CLIMATE FRIENDLY AND EQUITABLY PRODUCED FOOD. THIS IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT A PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT INTERMEDIARY SUPPLY CHAIN SUPPORT FOR SCHOOLS AND OTHER LARGE SCALE INSTITUTIONS. LOOK FUNDING FOR SCHOOL FOR FOOD HUBS IS NECESSARY IN ORDER TO BUILD BACK A BETTER FOOD SYSTEM A KANEMI SUPPORT LOCAL FARMING ECONOMIES ACCELERATE CLIMATE ADAPTATION AND RESILIENCE AND RE EMPLOY FOOD SYSTEM WORKERS. SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND OTHER PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS HAVE BEEN ENDEAVORING TO LEVERAGE THEIR SIGNIFICANT FOOD PURCHASING BUDGETS TOWARD THESE POSITIVE PUBLIC VALUES AND AB TEN OH NINE PROVIDES THE CRITICAL MISSING PIECE TO SUPPORT THEM IN THE THOSE EFFORTS IN ADDITION TO CREATING JOBS. AND SPURRING LOCAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. AB TEN OH NINE WILL ALSO SUPPORT DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AS THEY RECOVER FROM THE DRASTIC ECONOMIC IMPACTS OF THE COVERT NINETEEN PANDEMIC. THE FARM TO SCHOOL FOOD HUBS CREATED UNDER THIS BILL WILL PRIORITIZE AGGREGATION AND DISTRIBUTION FROM SMALL TO MID SCALE FARMS AND RANCHES THAT ARE COOPERATIVELY OWNED OR OWNED BY SOCIALLY DISADVANTAGED BEGINNING LIMITED RESOURCE VETERANS MINORITY OR DISABLED FARMERS AND RANCHERS TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND OTHER PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS. AB TEN OH NINE WILL INCREASE PURCHASING OF LOCAL CLIMATE FRIENDLY AND EQUITABLY PRODUCED FOOD BUILD A BETTER FOOD SYSTEM A KANEMI SUPPORT LOCAL FARMING ECONOMIES ACCELERATE CLIMATE ADAPTATION AND RESILIENCE. AN EMPLOYEE FOOD SYSTEM WORKERS ADDITIONALLY THESE FOOD HUBS WILL SERVE AS A MODEL FOR THE REST OF THE STATE TO FOLLOW AND HOPEFULLY ADOPT I AM PLEASED TO HAVE PAULA DANIELS CO FOUNDER OF THE CENTER FOR GOOD FOOD PURCHASING. AND SCOTT BURNT AND URBAN FARMER AND THE COORDINATOR OF THE RIVERSIDE UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT FOOD HAVE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF AB TEN OH NINE. THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATE MEMBER BLOOMIN IF WE COULD- BEFORE WE GET TO- WITNESSES MADAM SECRETARY GONNA CALL THE ROLL SO BECAUSE THAT WAS ONE. ASSEMBLY MEMBER REVERSED. HERE MATHIS.

WE DEVELOP A GOOD GOOD PERSON PROGRAM WITHIN THE LOS ANGELES FOOD POLICY COUNCIL WHICH I FOUNDED TEN YEARS AGO IS AN INITIATIVE THAT MAYOR BEATER THAT SUCH AND I'M PLEASED TO BE HERE TO TOP THE FINAL PART OF THIS IMPORTANT BATTLE. I'M L. UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT WAS AMONG THE FIRST TO ADOPT OUR PROGRAM IN TWENTY TWELVE AND AS A RESULT OF THAT IN ONE YEAR THEY WENT FROM LESS THAN 10% LOCAL SOURCING PRODUCE TO NEARLY FIFTY PERCENT. SOMETHING ABOUT TWELVE MILLION DOLLARS THE LOCAL FOOD ECONOMY AND CREATING OVER A HUNDRED FIFTY NEW JOBS. I PROGRAM EXPANDED NATIONALLY IT'S NOW HOUSING CENTER WE WORK WITH FIFTY FOUR INSTITUTIONS IN TWENTY ONE CITIES AROUND THE COUNTRY INCLUDING NEW YORK AND CHICAGO. IN CALIFORNIA ALONE OR IN TWENTY TWO PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS. FOURTEEN OF WHICH ARE SCHOOL DISTRICTS. I NEED TO CALIFORNIA TO. SPEND THE COME. ONE HUNDRED NINETY. TO ON FOOD PER YEAR. AND NOW DIRECTING AND- 16% OF THAT THEIR LOCAL FOOD ECONOMIES. SUPPORTING HUNDREDS OF CALIFORNIA LIVELIHOOD. THEY'D LIKE TO AND CAN DO SO MUCH MORE. ESPECIALLY TO SUPPORT THE SMALLER FARMERS BETTER 80% OF CALIFORNIANS. FARMING POPULATION. BUT TO DO THAT THEY NEED WHAT AB TEN OH NINE MAKES POSSIBLE FARM TO SCHOOL THROUGHOUT. BASED ON OUR INTENSIVE RESEARCH OVER THE PAST DECADE IT'S CLEAR THAT THE FUNCTIONS WHO HAD SERVED. IN CREATING A MORE DIRECT LINK AND THE LOCAL SUPPLY CHAIN ARE THE CRUCIAL MISSING PIECE. IN HELPING LOCAL FARMERS REACHED MARKETS AND LARGE INSTITUTIONS. I GAVE A LOT MORE DETAIL THE LETTER I SUBMITTED TO YOU ALL ABOUT HOW MANY COULD HAVE THERE ARE IN THE COUNTRY WHERE WHICH INCLUDES MICHIGAN MINNESOTA NEW YORK AND OHIO. STATE AND OTHERS HE COULD HAVE BEEN OTHER LOCAL PROJECTS AND INFRASTRUCTURE AS CRITICAL TO THEIR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. AND JOB CREATION STRATEGIES. THE PRIMARY MAYBE TEN ON A OR ARE REALLY AND- THAT PURPOSE AND HAPPY CONNECT. SMALLER SOCIALLY DIFFERENT AND SMART FARMERS FIFTEEN. MARK AFTER. A LARGE. LIKE SCHOOL DISTRICTS. BECAUSE ALL KEY TO AN EQUITABLE PANDEMIC ECONOMIC RECOVERY FOR CALIFORNIANS FARMERS THE SHARES OF THE PIE CHAIN RESILIENCE FOR TEACHER CRISIS. SUPPORT CLIMATE SMART PRODUCTION PRACTICES AND FOR THE WELL BEING OF CALIFORNIANS CHILDREN BY INCREASING ACCESS TO OUR LOCALLY GROWN HEALTHY FOOD AND ALSO LINKS WELL WITH THE PROVISIONS OF AB ONE TWENTY FIVE WHICH YOU'LL BE HEARING LATER.

PUT OBSERVER MISSION DRIVEN ARGUE. AIM TO AGGREGATING PRODUCE FROM SMALLER FARMS AND PROVIDING MUCH NEEDED SUPPORT TO LOCAL FARMING ECONOMIES. THE REQUESTED FOOD UP IS NOT ONLY GRANT FUNDED BUT RECEIVES TREMENDOUS IN KIND SUPPORT FROM THE SCHOOL DISTRICT INCLUDING TRUCKS WAREHOUSE INFRASTRUCTURE AND COUNTY THE MINISTRY TO BRIDGEPORT SUPPORT. WITHOUT THIS GRANT AND IN KIND SUPPORT THE FOOD WOULD NOT BE FINANCIALLY VIABLE. UNLIKE MAJOR FOOD DISTRIBUTION OF TWO THAT HAVE HIGH PROFIT MARGINS. TIONAL DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS ONLY RETURNED ELEVEN CENTS TO THE FARMERS FOR EVERY DOLLAR IN SALES WELL OF FOOD- WILL RETURN TO FARMERS. IMPORTANTLY FOOD HERBS ARE COMMUNITY FOCUSED IN BETTER THAN A LOCAL FARMER NETWORK AND HAVE THE MARKET INFRASTRUCTURE CAPACITY WITH SMALL SCALE FARMERS DON'T HAVE. FOR EXAMPLE DURING THE COPA NINETEEN PANDEMIC THE RIVER SAID FOOD I WAS ABLE TO QUICKLY PIVOT AND DISTRIBUTE ALMOST A HUNDRED. THOUSAND EMERGENCY FOOD BOXES BECAUSE OF THESE EXISTING RELATIONSHIPS. SMALL AND MEDIUM SPECIALTY CROP FARMERS ARE INDEPENDENT AND SELF RELIANT AND ARE NOT LOOKING FOR HANDOUTS OR SUBSIDIES THEY JUST WANTED DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM THAT WORKS IN THEIR FAVOR.

I WITH THE CALIFORNIA RULE LEGAL ASSISTANCE FOUNDATION- MISS KATTAN IF YOU ARE WITH US. YOU ARE WELCOME TO BEGIN. YES THANK YOU VERY MUCH- GOOD MORNING CHAIR RIVAS AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS I AM AN ACCOUNTANT WORK HEALTH AND SAFETY SPECIALIST WITH CALIFORNIA RURAL LEGAL ASSISTANCE FOUNDATION- TO START WE GREATLY APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR AND SPONSORS WILLINGNESS TO TRY TO ADDRESS CONCERNS ABOUT AB ELEVEN OH THREE AND TO NARROW THE POOL OF EMPLOYEES. ALLOWED TO WORK IN EVACUATION ZONES AND WE DO RECOGNIZE THE VALUE OF THE UNIFORMS STATE PROCESS FOR GRANTING PASSES TO AG PRODUCERS- AND HAVING ACCOMPANYING TRAINING REQUIREMENTS WITH THAT. HOWEVER WE ARE OPPOSED TO GRANTING PASSES THAT ALLOW ANY EMPLOYEES OF FARMS AND RANCHES INCLUDING MANAGERIAL EMPLOYEES TO WORK INSIDE EVACUATION ZONES. BECAUSE THESE WORKERS SHOULD NOT BE ASKED TO WORK OR ALLOWED TO WORK IN AREAS DEEMED UNSAFE FOR THE PUBLIC. ESPECIALLY IF THEY'RE GOING IN WITHOUT FIGHTER ESCORT- AND- IN A WITH DUE RESPECT- WE THINK THAT COMPARING THE BILL'S ACCESS PROVISIONS TO THE GRANTING OF PASSES TO THE PRESS ISN'T AN APPROPRIATE COMPARISON BECAUSE MEMBERS OF THE PRESS AREN'T WORKING. WITHIN THE EVACUATION. AND A COMMITMENT- WE ARE ALSO OPPOSED TO THE PROPOSED AMENDMENT TO THE PENAL CODE IN THIS BILL SKEWS ME. THAT WOULD ALLOW AG PASSHOLDERS ACCESS TO EVACUATION ZONES UNTIL RISK RISES TO THE LEVEL OF IMMINENT HARM. EXPERIENCE HAS SHOWN THAT WILDFIRES CAN EXPAND RAPIDLY AND THIS HIGH BAR FOR EXCLUDING PASSHOLDERS LEAVES NO MARGIN FOR SAFETY- INSTEAD WE THINK LAW ENFORCEMENT OR FIRE PERSONNEL SHOULD HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO REFUSE ENTRY TO ACT PASS HOLDERS- IF THEY JUDGE IT IS UNSAFE TO ENTER- IN CLOSING- WITHOUT FURTHER AMENDMENT TO EXCLUDE ALL EMPLOYEES. FROM THE AG PASS PROGRAM AND- AMENDMENT TO ALLOW LAW ENFORCEMENT AND FIRE PERSONNEL TO EXERCISE THEIR JUDGMENT ON WHEN TO ALLOW- ACCESS WE URGENT NO VOTE THANK YOU.

FARMERS IN THIS STATE PRODUCE FRUITS VEGETALES NUTS AND MEATS FROM ANIMAL LIVESTOCK IN ACCORDANCE WITH STATE PESTICIDE LABOR AND MINIMUM WAGE LAWS COMPLYING WITH THE STATE LAWS WITHOUT A DOUBT WE'VE HEARD INCREASES COST PROVIDES REAL BENEFITS TO THE HEALTH OF CONSUMERS TO THE ENVIRONMENT AND TO THE WORKERS WHO PRODUCE THESE GOODS. AB SEVEN TEN WOULD REQUIRE CERTAIN AGRICULTURE PRODUCTS SOLD TO THE PUBLIC TO BE PRODUCED IN COMPLIANCE WITH OUR STATE REGULATIONS THIS BILL WOULD PLACE OUR PESTICIDE REGULATIONS ON THE LISTED OUT OF STATE PRODUCE AND OUR LABOR REGULATIONS ON THE LISTED OUT OF STATE. COUNTRY PRODUCED THIS BILL WOULD ONLY APPLY TO THE FOLLOWING PRODUCE FRESH OR VALUE ADDED FRESH APPLES SPARGO'S BELL PEPPERS BLUEBERRIES DATES HONEYDEW MELONS LEMONS NECTARINES OLIVES AND TABLE GRAPES I CAN SHARE WITH YOU HOW WE CAME UP WITH THAT LIST IF NEED BE I UNDERSTAND THAT THE CONCERNS WITH THE ABILITY FOR GROCERY STORES TO SOURCE THESE PRODUCTS YEAR ROUND. BUT WE SPECIFICALLY CHOSE THESE LIST OF PRODUCTS BECAUSE A LOT OF THEM IF NOT ALL ARE GROWN YEAR ROUND HERE IN CALIFORNIA WHILE PRODUCTS LIKE APPLES ARE NOT IN SEASON YEAR ROUND THE OPEN MARKET AND OUR FARMERS HAVE ADDRESSED THE ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO ADJUST TO THOSE NEEDS. AN APPLE FARMER IN THE STATE OF WASHINGTON OR CHILE IT CAN TAP INTO A MARKET ALL THEY WOULD HAVE TO DO IS ENSURE THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF THEIR WORKERS. AND CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS THE- OF A HEALTHY AND SAFE SOCIETY. IS A HUMAN RIGHT AND THE LEGISLATURE CAN SHOW ITS COMMITMENT TO SAFEGUARDING THAT IDEAL. BY INSURING THEIR PRODUCE SOLD IN THE STATE MEETS THOSE SAME EXPECTATIONS THAT WE PUT ON OUR OWN FARMERS HERE IN CALIFORNIA. THE QUESTION WE MUST ASK OURSELVES. IS WHY DO WE PUT THESE REGULATIONS ON OUR FARMERS. AND I THINK IT'S SIMPLE. THE ANSWER IS A TO ENSURE THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF OUR- CONSUMERS- THE WORKERS. AND PROTECTING THE ENVIRONMENT I DON'T BELIEVE THAT WE'VE ADOPTED THESE REGULATIONS TO PURPOSELY HURT OUR FARMERS BUT CLEARLY WE'VE HEARD. THAT IT HAS. CAUSED A SIGNIFICANT ECONOMIC BURDEN TO SOME. FOR US THE INTENT OF THIS BILL. IS VERY CLEAR. IT'S ABOUT ENSURING THAT THE PRODUCTS SOLD IN THE STATE ME CALIFORNIA'S EXPECTATIONS ON HEALTH AND SAFETY. AND HUMAN RIGHTS OUT WITH THAT I WANT TO TELL YOU THAT- TRULY BELIEVE THAT- WE HAVE A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY HERE. TO UPHOLD THE AGRICULTURE INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA. AS A TOP PRIORITY AND MAKING SURE THAT AGAIN WE NEED THOSE HEALTH AND SAFETY. GOALS THAT WE SET EVERY SINGLE DAY WHEN WE PROVE PUBLIC POLICY HERE. OUT WE HAVE TO WITNESSES- THE FIRST IS ANTHONY BIANCO. WHO IS A LIFELONG FARMER IN THE COACHELLA IMPERIAL AND CENTRAL VALLEY. THE SECOND IS THAT NONE AND ON THIS YEAH WITH THE CALIFORNIA FARMWORKER FOUNDATION. RESEARCHER. AND TESSLER. MOTION BY SAMANTHA- IT'S A WITH THAT A PRE. THE TESTIMONY SOME A MEMBER OPERATOR WE PLEASE MAKE SURE TOO THAT WE- CONNECT MR BIANCO MISTER HERNANDEZ AND IF THEY ARE AVAILABLE NOW- PLEASE FEEL FREE TO A- TO START. IT IS A HALFPENNY BIANCO CAN YOU HEAR ME YES WE CAN. GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN I'M ANTHONY BIANCO THE CO OWNER OF ANTHONY VINEYARDS WITH OPERATIONS IN BOTH COACHELLA AND CENTRAL VALLEY. AB SEVEN TEN IS A CALIFORNIA FARM WORKER BUILT A CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL BILL THE CALIFORNIA FARMER BILL MAYBE THE FIRST TIME IN CALIFORNIA HISTORY THAT THESE THREE GROUPS HAVE JOINED FORCES TO GET BEHIND ONE BILL. AT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS ENSURED THE FARM WORKERS RECEIVE A LIVING WAGE AND THAT THE ENVIRONMENT IS PROTECTED GROWERS COSTS HAVE GONE UP DRAMATICALLY AND WE HAVE SEEN HIGHER LABOR COSTS LIKE THESE LISTED IN THE BILL. THAT WILL SOON NO LONGER BE PRODUCED AND THIS IS LEADING TO A DRAMATIC LOSS IN FARMWORKERS JOBS AT A LOSS IN CROP DIVERSITY FAR STATES GROWERS. BUT OTHER STATES AND COUNTRIES ARE NOW CAPITALIZING ON OUR STATE'S BRAVE LEADERSHIP AND SAFETY LIVING WAGES. FOR INSTANCE FOR NEARLY FORTY YEARS CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN REDUCING THE CHEMICALS GROWERS CAN USE OUR CROPS WE ARE FREELY GIVEN THREE REASONS FOR IT NUMBER ONE THE CHEMICALS ARE HAZARDOUS FOR THE FARMWORKERS REPLY IT GREAT REASON. NUMBER TWO THE CHEMICALS ARE NOT GOOD FOR THE ENVIRONMENT ANOTHER GREAT REASON NUMBER THREE THE CHEMICALS ARE DANGEROUS TO CONSUME. FANTASTIC REASON HOWEVER THESE THROUGH THESE SAME CHEMICALS ARE STILL USE GLOBALLY IN EVERY OTHER STATE AND THEN WE ALLOW THE STATE'S AND COUNTRY'S DIFFERENTLY SHIP FRUITS AND VEGETABLES CONTAIN THESE VERY CHEMICALS. APPLIED BY FARMWORKERS AND SOAKED INTO THEIR GROUND UNDERCUTTING OUR PRICES COSTING FARMWORKERS JOBS AND TO BE CONSUMED BY CALIFORNIANS WITHOUT CLOSING THIS BACK DOOR WE ARE NOT ONLY UNDER CUTTING OUR STATE'S AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRY WE'RE ALSO PUTTING CALIFORNIANS AT RISK. THIS BILL DOES NOT SAVE ALL CALIFORNIA FARMWORKERS JOBS AND WILL NOT SAVE ALL CALIFORNIA FARMS BUT IT WILL ENSURE THAT MANY CALIFORNIA FARM WORKERS AND GROWERS WILL CONTINUE SUPPLYING OUR STATE WITH THESE PRODUCTS. AND MORE IMPORTANTLY AND THAT THESE PRODUCTS WILL REPRESENT CALIFORNIA VALUES. EVERY TIME ONE OF THESE PRODUCTS IS BOUGHT AND CONSUMED IN CALIFORNIA YOU WILL KNOW THAT THE FORMER CREW HAD THEIR HANDS ON IT RECEIVED A LIVING WAGE AND. THAT THE ENVIRONMENT WAS FULLY PROTECTED. ALL OF THESE TEN. ARE PRODUCED EXPENSE AND I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THIS IS ONLY TEN PRODUCTS. THE BUYERS WILL TELL YOU THE PRICES WILL RISE AND SHELVES WILL NOT BE STOPPED THAT IS NOT THE CASE. AND HUGE MULTI BILLION DOLLAR MULTINATIONAL COMPANIES WILL BE FIGHTING THIS BILL TO ENSURE THEY KEEP **** KEEP SELLING OUT OF COUNTRY PRODUCT IN MAKING THEIR 60% ALL ALL CONTRIBUTING NOTHING TO OUR FARMWORKERS JOBS INTO OUR ECONOMY. FAR WORKING IS A STEPPING STONE TO A BETTER LIFE. AN ENTRY POINT TO THE AMERICAN DREAM THERE IS A NEW GENERATION OF FARMER CALIFORNIA ONE WHO CARES DEEPLY FOR THE FARM WORKERS WHO MAKE OUR INDUSTRY RUN. AND ALSO CARES PASSIONATELY FOR SHARED ENVIRONMENT AND I AM ONE OF THEM. CALIFORNIA FARMWORKERS AND MYSELF RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR YES VOTE ON AB SEVEN TEN THANK YOU. MISTER BARAK APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS MISTER HERNANDEZ IF YOU ARE READY TO GO FOR IS ALL YOURS. YES THANK YOU MR THE CALIFORNIA FORMATIVE FOUNDATION SUPPORTS LEGISLATION THAT EXPANDS PROTECTION FOR FARMWORKERS THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES. ALL WORK IS STILL NEEDED TO ENSURE THE SAFETY OF CALIFORNIA FARMWORKERS AB SEVEN TEN THIRTY STANDS FOR THE IMPORTATION OF CERTAIN CROPS INTO CALIFORNIA. THE STANDARDS ARE BASED ON CALIFORNIA'S GLOBALLY RECOGNIZED PESTICIDE AND FIFTY STANDARDS AND ENSURE THE PROTECTIONS AFFORDED TO FARMWORKERS HERE AND ALSO APPLY TO FARMWORKERS OUTSIDE OF OUR STATE. AB SEVEN TEN ALSO ENSURE THE PROTECTION OF PHARMACOLOGIC BECAUSE- FOR EXAMPLE THE COACHELLA VALLEY LAWMAKER POPULATION HAS GONE FROM SIXTY THOUSAND FARMWORKERS TO NOW JUST OVER TWENTY THOUSAND FARMWORKERS. CROPS MOVE OUTSIDE OF OUR STATE LINES WE NEED TO PROTECT THE LIVELIHOOD AND FUTURE FARMWORKERS ACROSS THE STATE BY SUPPORTING THIS LEGISLATION. CALIFORNIA THE NATIONAL LEADER IN SETTING STANDARDS FOR AUTOMOTIVE EMISSIONS AND AB SEVEN TEN IS ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF OUR STATE LEADING THE WAY AND PROTECTING THE HEALTH AND WELFARE. OF FARMWORKERS FORTY REASONS THE CALIFORNIA PHARMACARE FOUNDATION AS PROPS TO PORT EIGHTY SEVEN TEN AND WE THINK MR GARCIA. BURKE LEADERSHIP ON THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE. THANK YOU MR- AND SO WITH THAT I DO KNOW THAT WE HAVE WITNESSED THAT WILL BE TESTIFYING IN OPPOSITION. BUT THESE ARE GARCIA WITH THE CALIFORNIA GROCERS ASSOCIATION MISTER SEA IF YOU'RE WITH US. PLEASE FEEL FREE TO. PROVIDED TESTIMONY. HI THANK YOU TURN MEMBERS OF A TICKET WITH A CALIFORNIA GROCERS ASSOCIATION- FIGURE UNDERSTAND THE INTENT OF THE AUTHOR BUT WE MUST RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE SEVEN TEN DUE TO THE POSSIBLE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF THIS BILL I'M EIGHTY SEVEN CHANNEL CUT OFF ACCESS TO THE FRESH FRUITS AND VEGETABLES WITH DIFFERENT BILL- GROCERY GROCERY BY AS MUCH CALIFORNIA PRODUCT AS THEY CAN'T WANTED TO DO THAT ONE OF SEASON AND- PRODUCE ARE BROUGHT IN FROM OTHER STATES AND COUNTRIES IN ORDER TO KEEP THE SHELVES STOCKED WITH FRESH PRODUCE- NEED HELP. ENVIRONMENTAL LABOR REQUIREMENTS IN THE BILL MAKES IT DIFFICULT IF NOT IMPOSSIBLE TO THESE COMPORTS WITH. AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS. HORN PART FOR IMPORTED PRODUCTS TO COMPLY WITH THE LABOR STANDARDS WILL WILL BE TO. HELLO HAS MINIMUM MINIMUM WAGE IN THE COUNTRY L. DID HAVE CONTROL OF HOW OTHER STATES AND COUNTRIES THAT THE MINIMUM WAGE. IT WILL BE EVEN MORE DIFFICULT TO TRY TO COMPLY WITH THE STANDARD WHEN IMPORTING FROM OTHER COUNTRIES AS FOREIGN CURRENCIES FLUCTUATE ON A REGULAR BASIS- THIS BILL WILL LEAD GROCERS. WELL THIS BILL WILL LEAD. TO GROWTH OF MAKING A HARD DECISION OF NOT OFFERING THAT PRODUCT YOU TO COMPLIANCE ISSUES. OR THE ONLY AVAILABILITY OF THE LIST OF PRODUCTS WILL COME FROM PAST HARVEST THAT HAVE BEEN IN COLD STORAGE. AND THEY WILL BE SOLD AT MUCH HIGHER PRICES TO PEOPLE WHO CAN AFFORD IT. FOR THESE REASONS. CGA OPPOSES THIS BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISSING. FOR COMMENTS AND SO WITHOUT BRING IT BACK TO THIS COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS COMMENTS ASSEMBLY MEMBER CUNNINGHAM. RIGHT THANK YOU MR I'M I'M STRUGGLING WITH WITH THIS BILL AND IT'S FOR TWO REASONS I JUST WANT TO ARTICULATE THAT- AND THEN- SEE WHETHER OPEN TO. FURTHER AMENDMENTS THAT MIGHT ADDRESSES ISSUES- I'VE NOT TO GET TOO LEGALESE BUT I DO THINK THERE'S A COMMERCE CLAUSE PROBLEM- I'M NOT SURE HOW THAT CHALLENGING COURT WOULD COME OUT BUT I'M PRETTY SURE IT WOULD BE CHALLENGED- AND THERE'S POTENTIALLY AN- CHALLENGE UNDER THE- TREATY OF FORTY ALSO IN THE CONSTITUTION BECAUSE WE HAVE. TRADE AGREEMENTS WITH OTHER COUNTRIES IN PARTICULAR MEXICO- AND THIS THAT BECAUSE OF THE- THE MINIMUM WAGE ASPECT IN THE LABOR LAW ASPECT OF THIS BILL AS IT'S WRITTEN NOW WOULD ALMOST CERTAINLY PROHIBIT ANY IMPORTATION OF ANYTHING FROM FROM. MEXICO AND CALIFORNIA SO- MY SUGGESTION IS- OF MY THOUGHT AND WHEN I'M CURIOUS AS TO WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT IT IS IF THIS WERE NARROWED TO THE PESTICIDE PIECE WHICH IS CLEARLY A HEALTH AND SAFETY ISSUE. AND THE CHILD LABOR PEACE WHICH OTHERS UNIFORM AGREEMENT THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES OTHER COUNTRIES. CHILD LABOR'S INAPPROPRIATE SO- AND NOT AND NOT THE LABOR. PEACE I THINK YOU'D HAVE A CLEAN SALE BILL THROUGH. THE CONSTITUTIONAL CHALLENGES- IS WRITTEN NOW THE IT'S SORT OF IMPOSSIBLE TO COMPLY WITH THE MINIMUM WAGE IN CALIFORNIA'S EYES FROM WHICH- I THINK IN THE COUNTRY. IN TERMS STATES AND YOU KNOW WHEN YOU ADJUST FOR CURRENCY RATES WE CAN ALWAYS ALMOST COULD BE HIGHER THAN ALL OF SOUTH AMERICA SO- WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON THE CONSTITUTIONAL THING AND I'M NOT ASKING FOR LIKE A LEGAL OPINION BUT WHETHER THAT'S SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN THOUGHT THROUGH ADDRESSED THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS DID RAISE THAT ISSUE DID NICE JOB OF. KIND OF GOING THROUGH IT- AND THEN ARE YOU OPEN TO POTENTIALLY NARROWING THE BILL AT SOME POINT TO DO THE PESTICIDE AND CHILD LABOR PEACE. SO THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION THE FIRST AS WE DO HAVE A LEGAL. RIGHT COMING FROM- LET'S COUNCIL THE BILL HAS VERY SPECIFICALLY- BEEN FOCUSED ON THE ISSUE OF HEALTH AND SAFETY RIGHT. AND NOT THE ECONOMIC CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH INTERSECT WITH THE COMMERCE CLAUSE CONCERNS THAT YOU RAISE- THE NARROWING OF THE BILL IS THE ACTUAL PRODUCTS THAT HAVE BEEN SELECTED. AND THEIR AVAILABILITY YEAR ROUND TO TRY NOT TO GET INTO- THE ISSUES THAT THE GROCERS ASSOCIATION DRESSED ADDRESSED. DE UM ISSUE OF THE LABOR WE'RE CERTAINLY OPEN TO THAT BUT YOU KNOW THOSE ARE VERY FUNDAMENTAL. ISSUES THAT WE'VE ADOPTED HERE IN CALIFORNIA AS STANDARDS RIGHT- HUMAN RIGHTS STANDARDS- LIVING LIVING WAGE FOR WORKERS. IN CALIFORNIA AND THE ISSUE OF HEALTH AND SAFETY AND SO THOSE TWO COMPONENTS. ARE CRITICAL- TO HOW WE DO BUSINESS CAL. AND HOW WE SHOULD EXPECT PEOPLE DOING BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA- TO OPERATE IN SO I'M I'M OPEN TO LOOKING AT IT IN. THE INTEREST OF AVOIDING ANY LEGAL CHALLENGES BUT LOOK WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT WITH PROP TWO. AND PROP TWELVE THAT PASSED IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN THAT- FOCUSED ON THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF. CHICKENS AND OTHER ANIMALS WE THINK THAT THERE'S PRECEDENT. AROUND THE ISSUE OF HEALTH AND SAFETY. THAT APPLIES. TO THIS PARTICULAR PROPOSAL THAT'S BEFORE YOU TODAY. SHORT ANSWER OPEN TO THE IDEA ON THE LABOR. BUT I BELIEVE THAT- BOTH THE HAVE THE SAFETY IN THE LABOR ARE TWO PRINCIPLES THAT WE SHOULD LIVE BY STAND BY. AND APPLY THEM ACCORDINGLY- WHEN WE'RE EXPECTING OTHER PRODUCE TO BE SOLD- TO CALIFORNIANS AND REALLY- THAT'S REALLY THE FOCUS OF THE BILL BUT VERY OPEN- TO THOSE DISCUSSIONS MOVING FORWARD. ASSEMBLY MEMBER IRWIN- YES THANK YOU AND I HAD OF SOME OF THE SAME CONCERNS AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER CUNNINGHAM BUT I REALLY APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO HERE BECAUSE FOR YEARS WE'VE BEEN HEARING FROM OUR FARMERS THAT- THAT THE VALUES WE HOLD HERE AS CALIFORNIANS AS FAR AS A LABOR ISSUES AND ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES ARE MAKING THE PRODUCE IN CALIFORNIA MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE AND SO- THIS SORT OF WOULD LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD IF THERE'S SOME WAY TO. GET IT THROUGH LEGALLY SO I DO LIKE OF WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO HERE AS FAR AS A HIGH- MENTIONED SO COULD YOU GO OVER AGAIN HOW YOU PICKED THESE PRODUCTS BECAUSE CERTAINLY SEEMS LIKE SOME OF THE PRODUCTS ARE FAIRLY SEASONAL- I KNOW THAT- FOR INSTANCE IN VENTURA COUNTY THAT THAT BLUEBERRIES ARE GROWN OVER A VERY. SHORT PERIOD OF TIME SO- HOW WOULD WE MAKE SURE THAT CONSUMERS ARE NOT OF BLOCKING ACCESS TO- FRUITS AND VEGETABLES CERTAIN TIMES OF THE YEAR SO WE REACHED OUT TO THE WIDE ARRAY OF AG ASSOCIATIONS INCLUDING THE FARM PAYROLLS THE AG COUNCILS AND THEN WE GOT VERY SPECIFIC TO THE ACTUAL- PRODUCERS OF THE SPECIFIC- FRUITS AND VEGETABLES. AND THERE WERE SOME INTERESTING CONVERSATIONS WITH SOME OF THE GROUPS WHERE THE ACTUAL FARMERS WANTED TO BE INCLUDED BUT THE ASSOCIATION'S. DIDN'T SEE THE- POLITICAL INTERESTS GIVEN THE WIDE ARRAY OF FARMERS AT THE REPRESENT OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA AS WELL. AND SO THERE WERE SOME CONFLICTS BETWEEN THERE AND I'LL GIVE YOU THE EXAMPLE- THE FRUITS AND VEGETABLES THAT WERE PICKED. WE'VE BEEN GUARANTEED THAT THEY ARE MADE AVAILABLE- AND GROWN IN SPECIFIC PARTS OF THE STATE. ALL YEAR ROUND AND THERE ARE REGIONS IN CALIFORNIA THAT CAN DO THAT RIGHT- THE EXAMPLE WAS. A LOT OF PRODUCE. IS GROWN YEAR ROUND AND- WE HAD SOME CONVERSATIONS WITH FOLKS FOR EXAMPLE THE BLUEBERRIES THAT WERE ADDED LATER. BY REQUEST OF THE INDUSTRY. AFTER DISCUSSING WITH ALL OF THEIR PRODUCERS THAT IT'S VERY POSSIBLE TO PROVIDE THESE YEAR ROUND FROM CALIFORNIA. AND SO WE PUT OUT A CALL TO ALL OF THE ASSOCIATION'S. WITH THE HELP OF ORGANIZATIONS KIND OF THE CALL THE UMBRELLA ORGANIZATIONS LIKE FARM BUREAU WESTERN GROWERS AND OTHERS WHO LED US TO THESE- ASSOCIATIONS THAT REPRESENT THE SPECIFIC FRUITS AND VEGETABLES AND THAT'S HOW WE CAME UP WITH THE LISTEN. WE BELIEVE THAT IT IS A MODEST. LIST OF- PRODUCED VEGETABLES AND FRUITS THAT WE CAN COMPLY WITH AT THAT OUR SHELVES WILL NOT BE LEFT EMPTY- WELL WITH OUT THOSE PRODUCTS BECAUSE THE FARMERS THEMSELVES HAS SAID TO US. THAT THEY'RE ABLE TO MEET THOSE EXPECTATIONS AND PLAN FOR AND PLAN FOR A DEMAND IF NEEDED- TO STOCK UP. SO I SPECIFICALLY ALSO I APPRECIATE THAT THAT- THAT THE WORK THAT YOU'VE DONE IN THIS AREA SPECIFICALLY- I SEE LONDON'S ON THE LIST BUT I DON'T SEE A CITRUS MUTUAL ON THE SUPPORT LIST I ASSUME THAT THEY REPRESENT MANY. OF MULTINATIONAL ENTITIES TO AND THAT THAT THAT WAS THE CONFLICT BUT FARTHER. IN GENERAL THE LEMON GROWERS WANTED TO BE. THEN COLLUDED THE LEMON GROWERS IN COACHELLA VALLEY PERIL VALLEY. OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE MOST DEFINITELY. WANT TO BE INCLUDED. THE ASSOCIATION'S I BELIEVE. AND THEY CAN SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES I BELIEVE ARE CONFLICTED. WITH THE OTHER. PRODUCING INTEREST OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA SO LOOK FOR ME RIGHT I REPRESENT CALIFORNIA- OUR PRIORITY IS CALIFORNIANS AND THE PROTECTION OF CONSUMERS- THEIR HEALTH AND WELL BEING AND WE'RE ALSO WANTING TO MAKE SURE THAT- AS WE ADOPT THESE RULES AND REGULATIONS THAT THEY'RE APPLICABLES- IN HOLDING THAT SAME STANDARD. FOR GOODS THAT COME INTO CALIFORNIAN ARE SOLD OKAY AND THEN ONE MORE QUESTION- AS FAR AS- WHEN WE TALK ABOUT WHICH OF THE FARMWORKER WAGES WE DO HAVE OBVIOUSLY MINIMUM WAGE BUT WE HAVE- PEACE RIGHT ALSO SO OUR ART IS. THAT WHAT TYPE OF- WAGE TO OTHER STATES HAVE TO ADOPT. TO BE ABLE TO IMPORTANT TO CALIFORNIA. WHAT WHAT WE HAVE IN THE BILL AS IT'S CURRENTLY PRESENTED IS THE MINIMUM WAGE. THAT THAT'S THAT'S WHAT WE'RE FOCUSED ON RIGHT IS AT MEETING THAT- STANDARD ACROSS THE BOARD THAT WE BELIEVE AGAIN IS JUST ONE COMPONENT- TO HIGHLIGHT THE MOST IMPORTANT ONE IS THE HALTH AND SAFETY. OF THE GOODS THAT ARE SOLD IN CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU. OKAY OTHER ARMS COMES QUESTIONS ASSEMBLY WOMAN AGUIAR-CURRY- YEAH ASSEMBLY MEMBER I LIKE THAT THE IDEA OF THIS BILL YOU KNOW THAT BUT I DO HAVE A QUESTION. WHO IMPLEMENTS THIS BILL WHO WILL BE OUT WHAT DEPARTMENT WILL BE IN CHARGE OF IMPLEMENTING IT- AND- FOR STARTERS IMAGES OF THEMSELVES SO WE SEE. SIMILARITIES TO PROP TWELVE IT WAS A PASSED BY VOTERS 62% IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN D. DEPARTMENT OF FOOD AND AG AND THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. ARE TWO OF THE AGENCIES THAT OVERSEE THOSE ACTIVITIES I BELIEVE- THAT THAT IS THE SAME- ENTITIES THAT WILL OVERSEE THIS AS WELL HOW THE AGREED TO THAT YET- I CAN'T TELL YOU THAT THEY HAVE- BUT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT I WILL GET BACK TO YOU- AT THIS MOMENT WE'VE NOT GOTTEN ANY SIGNIFICANT PUSHBACK. RIGHT BUT- MAIN FOCUS OF THE BILL HAS BEEN ON THE ISSUE OF ADDRESSING LIKE THE FIRST QUESTION THAT WAS ASKED REGARDING THE COMMERCE CLAUSE- IN AGAIN I DON'T HAVE THE WHOLE LIST OF PRODUCTS IN FRONT OF ME- BUT I DO APPRECIATE ASSEMBLY MEMBER RUINS QUESTIONS TO YOU- REGARDING PARTICULAR BLOOD BLUEBERRIES THERE CERTAIN PLACES. YOU CAN GROWN THEY DO WELL. A THERE ARE TWO THAT WE DO TO PER. OUR PRODUCE. I'LL SLIDE OF THE UNITED STATES- AND THEIR CONTRACTS THE FARMERS HAVE TO GO THROUGH AS WELL- AND I'M SURE THOSE CONTRACTS AND RETAIL INDUSTRY SOME JUST. ARE YOU KNOW I'M I'M GONNA- GOING TO TODAY ON THIS BILL THAT JUST PASSED THE HOUSE OUTSTANDING QUESTIONS I THINK YOU AND I CAN WORK ON THOSE. THANK YOU IF YOU LIKE I'LL REPEAT THE LIST AGAIN RIGHT. THANK YOU OF FRESH APPLES ASPARAGUS BELL PEPPERS BLUEBERRIES DATES. I KNOW YOU MELONS LEMONS NECTARINES OLIVES AND TABLE GRAPES AND THEY WERE AGAIN THE OTHER. PRODUCES THAT WANTED TO JOIN BUT THEIR ASSOCIATIONS- SINCE MICHIGAN. WE'RE CONFLICTED. WITH THE INTERESTS THAT THEY REPRESENT THAT MANY TIMES ARE OUTSIDE OF THE STATE. FOR US THE REAL QUESTION IS A- WHOSE FIRST. WHO DO WE PRIORITIZE FIRST AND WHY AND I THINK THAT'S REALLY AT THE CORE OF- THE QUESTION- FOR YOU ALL TO DECIDE. WHEN DETERMINING THE TO SUPPORT THIS BILL. THANK YOU- SOME OF OUR FLOOR. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I THINK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD- I AM IN THE SUPPORT THIS BILL TODAY WE TALKED ABOUT IT IT IS AN INTERESTING. CONCEPT BECAUSE WE'VE HEARD IT A FEW TIMES. SINCE I'VE BEEN IN THIS BUILDING. THE REGULATIONS AND THE BURDEN THAT WE PUT ON. CALIFORNIA AG AND REQUIREMENTS THAT WE IMPOSE ON THEM. ARE TREMENDOUS- THERE IS A COST TO DOING BUSINESS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THAT SOMETIMES- IN MY OPINION IS REALLY REALLY EGREGIOUS AND QUITE FRANKLY AGGRESSIVE. WE HAVE NOT ALWAYS BEEN. KIND AS A BODY- TO THE AG COMMUNITY HAS RELATE TO SOME OF THE LAWS THAT WE DO PASS. SO I AM INCREDIBLY ENCOURAGED THAT WE ARE FOCUSED ON THE CALIFORNIA FARMERS NOW. AND I'VE SPOKEN TO SOME OF OUR LARGER PRODUCERS IN. THERE ISN'T AN IDEA THAT WE COULD HELP PRODUCT SHORTAGES AT CERTAIN TIMES OF THE YEAR AND THEY THEY BRING INTO THE IMPORT OF PRODUCTS- IN FROM MEXICO. A LOT OF THE LARGER ONES. ALREADY THE FALL UNDER THE SAME GUIDELINES I MEAN THEY THEY THEY MEET THE STANDARDS FROM CALIFORNIA TO BRING THOSE PRODUCTS AND SO. I GUESS WE COUPLE QUESTIONS. AT WHAT POINT DOWN THE LINE DO WE CONFIRM THAT AND IS THERE ANY LIABILITY ON THE DISC- LIKE TO DISTRIBUTORS BECAUSE A LOT OF PRODUCE GOES THROUGH THIS NEW. DISTRIBUTION CENTERS- BEFORE IT GETS TO THE STORE. SO WE THOUGHT ABOUT THAT. AND THEN ALSO THERE'S A TERMINATE HER TODAY FOR THE FIRST TIME- COLD KENNY SECTORS WHICH ARE SOME OF THE SMALL PRODUCERS. THAT MAY BE AN ETHNIC STORE. A MOM AND POP GROCERY STORE MIGHT BUY FROM A LOCAL GROWER THAT'S VERY LOCALIZED- MAYBE IT'S A FAMILY OWNED BUSINESS. WHAT ARE WE DOING TO THEM WILL THAT LITTLE MOM AND POP BE LIABLE AT THAT POINT- BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE THE DOCUMENTATION MAYBE IT'S JUST LIKE SAID A FAMILY OWNED SMALL OPERATION. SO I ABSOLUTELY SUPPORT THIS- BECAUSE I THINK IT'S A HUGE STEP FORWARD IN PROTECTING CALIFORNIA ACT. I DO THINK THERE'S A FEW THINGS WE DO NEED TO FLUSH OUT AND SO ONE IS THAT% THE LIABILITY ON THE DISTRIBUTION CENTERS. OR THE ART ON THE RETAILERS AND THEN ON THE MOM AND POP SOME OF THE SMALLER PRODUCERS- I DON'T WANT TO SEE. A STATE AGENCY. IMPOSING FINES AND FEES ON OUR COMMUNITY BASED ON BUSINESSES. THANK YOU FOR THOSE COMMENTS- I DON'T HAVE THE ANSWERS TO THOSE QUESTIONS THAT YOU POLLS- WILL GOING TO HAVE TO WORK ON THAT- AND GET BACK TO YOU AND SEE HOW WE- AT SOME PROTECTIONS- TO ADDRESS YOUR CONCERNS. RIGHT I WILL TELL YOU THAT- I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE THAT PROTECTING THE ENVIRONMENT IS A GOOD THING- HAVING LIVING WAGES FOR YOU KNOW OUR WORKERS IN CALIFORNIA IS A GOOD THING. AND PROTECT THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF OUR CONSUMERS IS A GOOD THING. AND MANY OF US HERE WILL WILL ARGUE THAT THAT'S WHY WE PASSED. THE POLICIES THAT WE DO. ON THE FLIP SIDE IS THAT- WE DON'T IMPOSE ALL SAYING. YOU KNOW EXPECTATIONS ON. BUSINESS ERA OCCURRING IN CALIFORNIA IN THIS CASE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE FRESH FOODS. AND GOODS THAT ARE SOLD HERE. AND IN THE INTEREST OF PROTECTING CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS- WE BELIEVE THAT BY DOING THIS. OUT WE RAISE THE BAR ALL THE WAY ACROSS THE BOARD AND WE CONTINUE. TO SEE A ROBUST AGRICULTURE INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA. FOR ME I SEE THE DIRECT CONNECTION TO THE WORK THAT I DO IN THE ENVIRONMENT SPACE. AND I AND I SEE THE DIRECT CONNECTION THAT HAS TO THE CONSTITUENTS THAT. I AND MANY OF YOU SERVE. IN AG COMMUNITIES ARE ARE FARMWORKERS BY. US SO- I APPRECIATE THAT THE QUESTIONS WE WILL LOOK AT THAT- AND MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN GET SOME. OF PROTECTIONS ARE RESPONSES TO THE CONCERNS THAT YOU RAISE BUT JUST WANTED TO REINFORCE THE POINT. ABOUT WHY THIS IS IMPORTANT. TO US NO AND I CAN CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THAT AND I WOULD JUST LIKE ENCOURAGE ALL OF US LIKE. AS WE MOVE FORWARD AND I SAID ON LABOR COMMITTEES WELL. AND THERE'S A LOT OF BILLS THAT. COULD SEEM VERY GOOD THERE IS A COST TO THAT. SO HAS REMOVING THIS THING FOR MAKE NO MISTAKE ABOUT THIS LIKE THIS IS GOING TO BE. A COST INCREASE TO THE CONSUMER. I CANNOT STE WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THAT. TO DO BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA THERE IS AN EXPENSE TO THAT THAT IS GOING TO BE PASSED ON THE LINE I THINK WE AS A BODY. NEED TO KEEP THAT IN MIND TOO THAT WE THERE'S A BALANCED ALL OF THIS. SO I APPRECIATE YOUR TIME. THANK YOU. I SHOULD MATHIS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MISTER SHE. I APPRECIATE YOUR WORK. ON ON THE- YOU YOU NEVER SHOW AWAY FROM. THREADING THE TOUGH NEEDLES- I DO SURE A LOT OF THE SAME CONCERNS OVER FOR TODAY ON THE LEGAL SIDE ON THE CONCERNS FOR THE INTERSTATE COMMERCE PIECE- BUT I HAVE TO AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUES. ON ON BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE ON THIS THAT. AGRICULTURAL AND CALIFORNIA IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. IN THE COMMENTS FROM MR FLORA THAT WE PUT EXTRA STRENUOUS REGULATIONS. ON OUR INDUSTRY HERE. IT ISN'T JUST AGRICULTURISTS INCLUDES OIL IT'S EVERYTHING ACROSS THE BOARD THERE IS A HIGHER COST OF DOING BUSINESS HERE IN CALIFORNIA. AND I THINK MR GARCIA AS YOU'VE MENTIONED NO WE SEE A LOT OF OR NORMAL AGRICULTURAL ASSOCIATION ALLIES. NOT SHOWING SUPPORT OR OPPOSITION ON THIS BILL. BECAUSE WE KNOW IT AS SAID THAT THEIR BODIES ARE MADE UP OF GROWERS IN MULTIPLE DIFFERENT STATES AND COUNTRIES. AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I'VE LOOKED AT BEING VICE CHAIRMAN OF THIS COMMITTEE GOSH GOING OF WHAT WE'RE ON SIX SEVEN YEARS NOW. IS THE VERY SIMPLE THING OF WHAT ARE WE DOING FOR THE CALIFORNIA GROWERS. NOT FOR THE ASSOCIATION. NOT NOW FOR. THE BIGGER SUFFERED FOR THE MOM AND POP SMALL GROWERS IS TRYING TO KEEP THE FAMILY FARM ALIVE. DOES THIS HELP THEM. DOES THAT HELP THEM COMPETE ON A LARGER SCALE. WHERE DOES IT HURT THAT. AND I BELIEVE THE INTENT ON THIS LEGISLATION HERE BEFORE US TODAY IS TO CREATE AS MUCH IRWIN SAID. A MORE EQUAL PLAYING FIELD FOR OUR SMALLER FAMILY GROWERS- ON TO ADD THAT VALUE OF THE HARD WORK THAT THEY GO THROUGH- I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU MISTER GARCIA ON ADDRESSING SOME OF THESE OTHER CONCERNS I'M I'M SURE. YOU'LL BE HEARING FROM MR FLOOR MORE ON ON THE LABOR SIDE AND MISTER CUNNINGHAM ON THE LEGAL EAST SIDE- I WILL SUPPORT YOU TODAY ON THIS BUT I DO LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING THIS TIED UP AS IT MOVES FORWARD. THANK YOU HE WAS VERY SHARE ANY OTHER. SOME COMES FROM I WAS THE COMMITTEE. SOME OF THE UP WITH- MISTER GARCIA THANK YOU FOR BRINGING US FOR I MEAN I ECHO WHAT A LOT OF MY COLLEAGUES HAD JUST MENTIONED. IN MY DISTRICT- WE WERE KNOWN FOR SPARES WE HAD THE BIGGEST DISPARITIES FESTIVAL. AND STATE OF CALIORNIA I MEAN. THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WOULD COME THROUGH BUT NOT JUST FOR THE PURPOSE FOR THE FOR THE EVENT BUT- OUR FARMER OWNERS- FARM GROWERS- THE BEST BURGERS. I'M TALKING STICK AS A STRINGER. YOU KNOW NOT NOT NOT TO SAY ANYTHING WHAT MEXICO BRINGS IN BECAUSE THEY'RE VERY VERY SKINNY RIGHT- BUT IT WAS THE BEST AND IT WAS AND WE FOLLOW EVERY REGULATION THAT THE STATE PUTS OUR FARMERS TO I MEAN WE LEAD WERE THE BEST RIGHT. BATES WHEN WE WHEN WE SAY THAT IT COMES AT THE COST AND I UP AND I'M GLAD THAT- MISS IRWIN PRODUCT THAT HOPEFULLY THIS WILL BREAK BRING YOU KNOW UP AND EVEN PLAYING FIELD HOPEFULLY THIS WOULD EVEN BRING SOME OF OUR FARMERS TO REGROW WHAT THEY DID BEFORE BECAUSE OUR FARMERS. THEY'LL SWITCH. WITH WHAT IS WHAT IS WHAT WHAT. WHAT ILLEGAL BUT NOT EQUALS OUT BUT- WHAT THEY CAN PRODUCE WHAT YOU KNOW WHAT PENCILS OUT WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY. YOU KNOW AND IT IS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE FARM WORKERS BECAUSE THEY LOVE THEIR FARMWORKERS YOU KNOW THEY THEY ARE. AND SO I'M GLAD YOU BROUGHT THIS FORWARD- I AM VERY SUPPORTIVE AND I AM I AM I'M HOPING THAT THAT OPENS UP SO THAT WE CAN EVENTUALLY BRING BACK- YOU KNOW MORE HERE. AND FILL UP OUR OUR SHELVES IF THEY SAY THAT THEY WERE NOT GOING TO FILL THOSE OUT WE ARE WE WILL FARMERS WILL FILL UP THE SHELVES THREE.

THANK YOU CHAIR MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF- AB THREE FIFTY COURAGEOUS A THREE YEAR PROGRAM THAT PROVIDES TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO HELP CREATE CONSERVATION MANAGEMENT PLANS FOR LANDOWNERS AND FARMERS. THESE PLANS WILL DRESS THE IMPACTS OF THEIR AGRICULTURAL PROPERTIES FROM THE IMPLEMENTATION OF SIGMA. MOVING FORWARD I AM COMMITTED TO WORK WITH STAKEHOLDERS TO EXPRESS THE AXIS TO THIS GRANT PROGRAM TO INCLUDE MORE CRITICAL OVERDRAFT BASINS BISONS ACROSS THE ENTIRE STATE. WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY IN IN THE SUPPORT OF THE BILL IS KATIE PATTERSON CALIFORNIA POLICY MANAGER FOR AMERICAN FARMLAND TRUST. THANK YOU SEVEN MEMBER- OPERATOR IF YOU CAN PLEASE CONNECT- IS PATTERSON WHO- WILL BE TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. IT'S PAST IF YOU WITH US PLEASE- PLEASE BEGIN. GOOD MORNING CHAIRING COMMITTEE MEMBERS AGAIN MY NAME IS KATIE PATTERSON NINE THE CALIFORNIA POLICY MANAGER FOR AMERICAN FARMLAND TRUST WE'RE PROUD TO SPONSOR EIGHTY THREE FIFTY I'D FIRST LIKE TO SHARE A LITTLE ABOUT OUR ORGANIZATION FOR THOSE WHO MAY NOT KNOW THE REST OF OUR WORK YES HE NOW HER FORTIETH YEAR CREATED THE CONSERVATION AGRICULTURE MOVEMENT WHICH SEEKS FOR THE LAND AND FOR THE PEOPLE WHO GROW ARCHES. AT THE MOVEMENT'S LEADERS IN THE NATIONAL AGRICULTURAL LAND TRUST WE HAVE THREE PRIORITY PROTECTING AGRICULTURAL LAND PROMOTING ENVIRONMENTALLY SOUND FARMING PRACTICES IN KEEPING FARMERS ON THE LAND. YES TO UNITE. ENVIRONMENTALISTS AND POLICYMAKERS AND DEVELOPING PRACTICAL SOLUTIONS LIKE EIGHTY THREE FIFTY THAT PROTECT FARMLAND AND THE ENVIRONMENT. SO WHERE ARE WE NOW WATER SCARCITY A CHANGING CLIMATE NEW REGULATIONS AND A GROWING POPULATION ARE JUST SOME OF THE CHALLENGES FACING FARMERS AND FARMLAND IN CALIFORNIA. IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY CALIFORNIA'S LARGEST AGRICULTURAL REGION. AN ANTIQUE WORK IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY WE FOUND THAT HIGH QUALITY FARMLAND MORE PRODUCTIVE VERSATILE AND RESILIENT WITH A RELIABLE WATER SOURCE IS VERY LIMITED WITH ONLY 9% OF ROUGHLY SIX MILLION ACRES OF IRRIGATED FARMLAND IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY. BEING OF HIGH QUALITY AND EXPERIENCING LOW WATER STRESS. ACCORDING TO THE STATE'S STRAPS GROUNDWATER REPORT STATE WIDE. GROUNDWATER OVERDRAFT IS ESTIMATED TO BE IN THE RANGE OF TWO TO TWO AND A HALF MILLION ACRE FEET PER YEAR. AND ACCORDING TO THE PUBLIC POLICY INSTITUTE OF CALIFORNIA INDICATIONS ARE THAT NEARLY 40% OF THE CURRENT SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY CROPLAND OR SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND ACRES OF LAND. MAY NEED TO BE FOLLOWED OR RETIRE TO BRING GROUNDWATER AQUIFER BALANCE. THIS SHIFT WOULD HAVE AN ECONOMIC COSTS OF APPROXIMATELY TWO BILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR. ACCORDING TO THE PUBLIC POLICY INSTITUTE. THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT THERE WILL BE SUBSTANTIAL COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH ACHIEVING SUSTAINABLE GROUNDWATER MANAGEMENT BUT THE LONG TERM ECONOMIC IMPACT WOULD BE CONSIDERABLY GREATER IF GROUNDWATER. USE IS NOT MANAGE TO SEE AN UGLY ANTISEPTIC TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE IS NOT MADE AVAILABLE PERFECT MY CONSERVATION PLANNING. SO WHY EIGHTY THREE FIFTY. ACROSS THE STATE FARMERS ARE STRUGGLING WITH DEVELOPING ON FARM CONSERVATION PLANS AND REACHING THE WATER USE REDUCTION GOAL BUT THE ACT WE RECOGNIZE IN MANY CASES SOCIALLY DISADVANTAGED FARMERS MAY REQUIRE INTENSIVE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. INCLUDING LANGUAGE SUPPORT TO MEET THE REQUIREMENTS AFFECT MATH. THIS BILL WOULD ENCOURAGE INNOVATION AND ALTERNATIVE ECONOMICALLY VIABLE APPROACHES TO AGRICULTURAL LAND MANAGEMENT. AND SEEKS TO PREVENT UNNECESSARY FOLLOWING INCREASING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND CONSERVATION PLANNING FOR AGRICULTURAL PRODUCERS IS ESSENTIAL TO HELP THE MOST IMPACTED COMMUNITIES BE SUCCESSFUL IN ACHIEVING THE STATE'S AMBITIOUS GOALS. ESTABLISHED IN A SUSTAINABLE GROUNDWATER MANAGEMENT ACT. WHEN FARMS AND RANCHES ARE MOST MANAGED FOR MULTIPLE BENEFITS THEY HELP TO PROTECT THE MOST VALUABLE AND PRODUCTIVE AGRICULTURAL LAND. PROJECT HE SAYS THAT THE GROUNDWATER SUPPLIES AND SUPPORT CRITICAL HABITAT FOR FISH AND WILDLIFE. FOR THESE REASONS WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST I FELT I'M AVAILABLE FOR ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE.

THANK YOU MR VICE CHAIR COLLEAGUES PLEASED TO PRESENT- LEGISLATION IS ON THE BILL ONE TWENTY FIVE IT'S A FOOD AND FARMING RESILIENCE BOND. HI AND I'VE INTRODUCED THIS BILL BECAUSE IT'S TIME THAT- WE FOCUS AND WE BUILD. A FOUNDATION FOR A BETTER FOOD SYSTEM HERE IN OUR STATE ONE THAT'S MORE RESILIENT MORE SUSTAINABLE AND MORE JUST. WHEN I WAS- I WANTED CHAIR OF THE ASSEMBLY AGRICULTURE- LAST FALL. YEAH I EMBARKED ON A STATEWIDE TOUR MANY OF YOU HELPED- IDENTIFY LOCATIONS AND- ACCORDING VISITS A LOT OF YOU. SHOULD DIGITORUM JOIN ME WHILE WE WERE ON THIS TOUR AND WE KNOW THAT WE HAD TO CUT SHORT UNFORTUNATELY BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC BUT- IN IT TOO MUCH WE VISITED OVER FIFTY SITES- ENGAGED. OVER SEVENTY STAKEHOLDERS- WE DID RELEASE A REPORT RECENTLY ON ON OUR FINDINGS AND SOME RECOMMENDATIONS- THAT WOULD GENERATED ON THE TOUR BUT- WHEN WE GET STAKEHOLDERS WE MET WITH FARMERS WITH AGRICULTURAL AND FARM WORKERS WITH INDUSTRY UNION LEADERS WITH ENVIRONMENTALISTS WITH SCIENTISTS- AND RESEARCH TEAMS FROM UC DAVIS UCLA. NOW WITH LOCAL ELECTED OFFICIALS- AND YOU KNOW ON ON ON OUR TOUR WE VISITED A JUST- SEVERAL OPERATIONS AG OPERATIONS MASSIVE FARMS SMALL FARMS WE VISITED- SOME COMMUNITY GARDENS ARE FOOD BANKS WE KNOW PEOPLE ACROSS OUR STATE WHO. ARE INVESTED IN AND WORK EVERY SINGLE DAY TO PRODUCE OUR FOOD AND TO KEEP EVERY RESIDENT HERE IN THIS STATE AND AROUND THE WORLD THAT. AND THROUGHOUT OUR TO IT WAS CLEAR THAT KOBE NINETEEN HAS LAID BARE THE VULNERABILITIES AND THE INEQUITIES WITHIN OUR FOOD SYSTEM. YOU KNOW SINCE THE BEGINNING A PANDEMIC THE NUMBER OF FOOD INSECURE RESIDENTS HERE CALIFORNIA HAS INCREASED BY TWO POINT ONE MILLION- BRINGING THE TOTAL FOOD INSECURE PEOPLE ARE SET UP TO SIX POINT FOUR. MILLION RESTAURANTS AND OTHER FOOD RELATED BUSINESSES THEY'VE BEEN- THEY'VE BEEN HIT HARD. BY THIS PANDEMIC MANY OF CLOSE THEIR DOORS AND WON'T REOPEN. SO FARMERS HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE GONE THROUGH HUGE VOLATILITY- ESPECIALLY THOSE THAT RELY ON RESTAURANT AND INSTITUTIONAL MARKETS. AND IT MANY HAVE LOST HUGE NUMBERS OF CROPS BECAUSE OF FAILED TO SUPPLY CHAINS. AND SO FARM AND AGRICULTURAL WORKERS AND ARE ESSENTIAL FOOD SUPPLY CHAIN WORKERS MANY OF THEM LIVE IN OVERCROWDED HOUSING AS WE ALL KNOW. AND THEY'VE BEEN ESPECIALLY VULNERABLE TO COVER NINETEEN AS AS AS THE DATA. SUGGESTS IN. AND STATES AND SO NOW THAT WE ARE FINALLY BEGINNING TO EMERGE FROM THIS. GLOBAL PANDEMIC IN THIS CRISIS. WHEN IT COMES TO OUR FOOD SYSTEM WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT IT STAYS HEALTHY. THE NEXT CRISIS. AND SO WE NEED TO PROTECT THE PEOPLE AND THE OPERATIONS THAT KEEP US FED. I AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT NO CALIFORNIAN GOES HUNGRY BECAUSE IT'S UNACCEPTABLE- AND SO THIS PROPOSED BILL THIS BOND EFFORT WILL IMPROVE OUR FOOD SYSTEM IN FOUR KEY WAYS FIRST IT. PROPOSES TO INVEST IN FOOD PROCESSING DISTRIBUTION AND MARKET INFRASTRUCTURE INCLUDING SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS TO INCREASE CAPACITY FOR EMERGENCY FOOD- SO DISTRIBUTION ACROSS OUR STATE. SECOND PROPOSES TO PROTECT FARM AND FOOD SYSTEM WORKERS BY MAKING INVESTMENTS IN WORKFORCE HOUSING. BY PROCURING WORKPLACE PP AND INVESTING AND PUBLIC HEALTH INITIATIVES FOR FARMING AGRICULTURAL WORKERS. THIRD IT WOULD COMBAT HUNGER- AND EXPAND HEALTHY FOOD ACCESS FOR OUR SCHOOL STUDENTS MOST VULNERABLE FAMILIES- AND FOR OUR SENIORS IN THE STATE. AND FOR THIS BOND- IT IT SEEKS TO PROMOTE SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE AND CLIMATE RESILIENCE BY INCREASING INVESTMENTS IN EXISTING OVERPRESCRIBE CDFA PROGRAMS- THAT. YOU'LL CERTAINLY HAVE HAVE- I SHOWN TO HAVE A- A BENEFIT FOR MANY GROWERS IN THE STATE. A LOT OF WORK HAS BEEN INVEST IN THIS LEGISLATION- TO DATE THERE OF WE HAVE OVER A HUNDRED ORGANIZATIONS FROM ACROSS CALIFORNIA.

WE MUST THAT HOLD POLLUTERS ACCOUNTABLE AND DIRECTOR TIME AND LIMITED PUBLIC RESOURCES TOWARD RAPIDLY TRANSITIONING TO ACTUALLY LOW CARBON AGRICULTURAL SYSTEM. THE SECTION I MENTIONED PROPOSES TO REDUCE METHANE AND CO TWO EMISSIONS THEIR PASTURE BASED GRAZING GRADING AND OTHER HOT TREND THAT IS THE TARGET OF POPULAR TED TALK LEAVING REVIEW RESEARCH HAS BEEN MORE SOBERING. NO ROGUE RESOURCES INSTITUTE IN THE US AND THE FOOD CLIMATE RESEARCH NETWORK IN THE UK. HAVE COME TO SIMILAR CONCLUSIONS. THAT THE- COULD AS A AGRICULTURE APPROVED HEALTH YOUR- VALUABLE EMPIRE BACK. BUT ARE UNLIKELY TO ACHIEVE BY SCALE EMISSIONS REDUCTION. AND QUOTE. ONE THAT THE LIMITED AMOUNT OF QUEUES CLUSTER THROUGH GRADE WHAT EVENTUALLY BACK POINT AND ALL THE WHILE THE LAST RECORD FILLED. CAN COOK IS NOT THE METHANE. HERE INTERROGATION INTO THE ATMOSPHERE. IN A TO HAVE ANY HOPE DEALING WITH CLIMATE. WE HAVE TO SHOW OUR STUFF EITHER WAY LIVESTOCK WELCOME FORMER RENDITION.

AND ALL OTHER PORTIONS OF THE BILL THAT PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR LIVESTOCK DAIRY OR FISH OPERATIONS OR THAT INCLUDES MEAT OR DAIRY AND FEEDING PROGRAMS ANIMAL AGRICULTURE IS A LEADING CONTRIBUTOR TO THE CLIMATE CRISIS DEFORESTATION SPECIES EXTINCTION OCEAN DEAD ZONES AND MULTIPLE ADDITIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CRISES. DOZENS OF RECENT PEER REVIEWED STUDIES CONCLUDE THAT SIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS IN ANIMAL FOOD PRODUCTION AND DIETARY SHIFTS TOWARD MORE PLANTS ARE CRUCIAL ELEMENTSIN ANY EFFECTIVE PLAN FOR ADDRESSING THE CLIMATE CRISIS. CONSUMPTION OF MEAT DAIRY FISH AND EGGS IS BLANKS TO KILLER DISEASES SUCH AS HEART DISEASE DIABETES ASTHMA STROKE ALZHEIMER'S AND CANCER CONDITIONS THAT DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACT AND KILL PEOPLE OF COLOR AND OTHER MARGINALIZED POPULATIONS ADDITIONALLY MANY OF THESE DISEASE AN INCREASED RISK FOR SEVERE AND FATAL COVERT NINETEEN FACTIONS. FURTHER VIRAL PANDEMICS HAVE ARISEN FROM LIVESTOCK OPERATIONS IN THE PAST AND LIKELY WILL AGAIN AN EDITORIAL IN THE JOURNAL BIOSCIENCE SIGNED BY OVER ELEVEN THOUSAND SCIENTISTS. CONCLUDES THAT EATING MOSTLY PLANT FOODS WHILE REDUCING THE GLOBAL CONSUMPTION OF ANIMAL PRODUCTS CAN IMPROVE HUMAN HEALTH AND SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS SINCE THE PURPOSE OF AB ONE TWENTY FIVE IS TO ENSURE A SECURE RESILIENT SUSTAINABLE AND EQUITABLE FOOD AND FARMING SYSTEM IT IS ANTITHETICAL TO THE BILL'S PURPOSES TO INCLUDE SUPPORT FOR ANIMAL AGRICULTURE.

FOR GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. I OKAY THANK YOU I DO NOT OPPOSE FUNDING TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS BUT I- SEE THAT THERE IS AN ANIMAL AGRICULTURE IS AN INDUSTRY THAT ALREADY HAS LARGE SUBSIDIES. AND THOSE SUBSIDIES ARTIFICIALLY LOWER THE PRICE SO THAT THOSE TACOS YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT CAN BE AS CHEAP AS THEY ARE IF THE SUBSIDIES THAT ARE CURRENTLY EXISTING WERE TAKEN AWAY. THEN PEOPLE WOULD BE ABLE TO AFFORD THE FRUITS AND VEGETABLES MORE EASILY I LOVED IT AN EARLIER BILL IS SUPPORTING FRUITS AND VEGETABLES. THE PRICE IS NOT PART OF THE LOOKED TOWARD AND THE OTHER PART OF IT. GLAZER pEXPENSIVE THAN HAMBURG. SO RIGHT I KNOW BECAUSE SUBSIDIES ARE NOT THAT'S THE PROBLEM THAT'S EXACTLY THAT'S WHY I'M SAYING THAT IF YOU IF YOU ACTUALLY HAD TO BUY THAT HAMBURGER FOR WHAT IT COST TO ASSIST US AS A SOCIETY TO CLEAN UP THE MESS FROM AND TO DEAL WITH THE CLIMATE ISSUES TO DEAL WITH THE HEALTH ISSUES IT WILL COST FOURTEEN DOLLARS PER FROM NEED AN ONYX CAN I. ASK YOU WOULD YOU PREFER MORE PEOPLE DE SALADS REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS THAT IS. A LARGER THREAT TO US- YES I WORK EVERY DAY. TO TO ADDRESS THE CLIMATE CRISIS BECAUSE IT IS THAT YOU JUST WHAT THE HUGE AMOUNT HI. OKAY THIS AND ANY OTHER. QUESTIONS WHAT. BECAUSE YOUR OPPOSITION THEM CONTRA LAST AFTER OUR MY IF YOU'RE GONNA ASK FOR MY OPINION RESPECTFULLY PLEASE LET ME FINISH BECAUSE I HAVE SOME INSULIN ALTERATION TO BRING HERE. AND STAY ON TOPIC MELANIE FETISH IT'S- K. PLEASE FINISH. MY SIMPLE QUESTION WOULD YOU LIKE TO SHARE RIGHT YOU CAN TYPE SO YES THERE. ARE I CLICK MY- I MY JOB AS A MINISTER MY PAID JOB. BECAUSE OF HOW MUCH THEY CARE ABOUT THE CLIMATE CRISIS AND I WANT YOUR CHILDREN AND MINE TOP- WHERE WE CAN LIVE. JUDY AND SO YES I CARE ABOUT REDUCING EMISSIONS. BUT THE WAY TO REDUCE EMISSIONS IS NOT TO SUBSIDIZE AN INDUSTRY THAT IS CREATING A MISSION IT IS TO INVITE THAT THAT INDUSTRY TO TRANSFORM AS VICTORIA WAS MENTIONING IN THE UK THERE NOW INSTEAD OF SUBSIDIZING THE PRODUCTION OF ANIMAL PRODUCTS OR OTHER FARM PRODUCTS THEY ARE SUBSIDIZING. SEQUESTRATION OF CARBON AND THIS BILL IS FLAWED BECAUSE IT GIVES AN INDUSTRY ANOTHER HAND OUT AN INDUSTRY THAT DOESN'T NEED IT THAT IS THAT IS THE BUT LEAVE IT THERE ARE THERE ARE NINE PLANETARY DOWNTOWN GREASE FIVE OF WHICH WE HAVE ALREADY CROSSED INTO UNSAFE OR POTENTIALLY UNSAFE TERRITORY IN ANIMAL AGRICULTURE IS THE LEAD AND FOUR OF THOSE INCLUDING THE CLIMATE CRISIS. AND WE CANNOT AFFORD TO KEEP PRETENDING THAT THIS ACT AND THAT THIS INDUSTRY- CAN CONTINUE AT THE RATE THAT IT IS WE NEED TO CHANGE YOUR DIET THE SCIENCE IS VERY CLEAR WE NEED TO REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF ANIMALS THAT WE RAISE FOR FOOD I DON'T NEED TO CHANGE YOUR DIET. WILL NOT MESS WITH IT WILL NOT BE ABLE TO KEEP FROM. GOING INTO A RUNAWAY GLOBAL. AND I THINK THAT. I APPRECIATE THAT OKAY THAT I AND I CAN MORNING AND I ASSURE YOUR ABOUT OUR ENVIRONMENT AND OUR KIDS CHECK OUT I ALSO WANT TO BE ABLE TO. OKAY AND I DON'T CARE THAT WE HAVE IN INDIA THIS TO THE TABLE. TO REDUCE THEIR GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS THAT PRODUCE MEAT AND MILK THAT ALLOW OUR KIDS TO SURVIVE. OKAY SO CAN. CONTRACTORS MATT MA'AM YOUR- A MEMBER YOUR YOUR TIME IS UP MISTER FLORNOY CONCLUDE YOUR REMARKS PLEASE I'LL CONCLUDE MY REMARKS- THANK YOU. MISTER GRAY. YOUR YOUR REMARKS ARE FALSE DICHOTOMY BETWEEN EATING A SALAD ADAM MA'AM IT'S NOT YOUR TOTAL THIS WEEK YOU HAVE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY. THE R. OPERATOR IF THAT WOULD MAKE IT A LOT. GLORIA TO GET IN. THE OPERATOR IF YOU COULD MUTE THE LINE INTEL- THEY ARE ADDRESSED BY A MEMBER THROUGH THE CHAIR THANK YOU. THANK THANK YOU- MISTER CHAIR. I THANK YOU JERRY THIS FOR BRING IN THIS- BEFORE US TODAY- ALL ECHO SOME OF THE COMMENTS MY COLLEAGUE FROM. REPPAN SHARED WITH US- THE HYPOCRISY IN THIS STATE. THAT MANY OF US WHO REPRESENT RURAL AND AGRICULTURAL COMMUNITIES DEAL WITH ALMOST DAILY IF NOT HOURLY HERE AT THE STATE CAPITOL. IF YOU THINK ABOUT ALL WE SHOULDN'T SUBSIDIZE INDUSTRIES BUT THEN WE END UP SUBSIDIZING SPORTS CARS. FOR PEOPLE IN THE BAY AREA HOW WAY BECAUSE THEY ARE. MEETING OUR- I AM IT TO GOALS WE'RE GONNA. GIVE THAT PERSON THAT NEEDED. YOU KNOW SIX OR SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLAR SUBSIDY ON A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS SPORTS CAR. BECAUSE THAT'S GOING TO MAKE THE DIFFERENCE. WHEN NOW VICE PRESIDENT KAMILLA HARRIS CAME. THROUGH MY DISTRICT CAMPAIGNING FOR A DIFFERENT JOB WHEN SHE WAS RUNNING FOR STATEWIDE OFFICE HERE IN CALIFORNIA WINTERSON CONVERSATION. WHERE WE SAT WITH A BUNCH OF. ADD BUSINESS PEOPLE FOR MY DISTRICT AND WENT AROUND THE ROOM AND TALK TO EVERYBODY AND- EVERY SINGLE PERSON IN THE ROOM THE NEW APPRECIATE THIS MISTER CHAIRMAN INTRODUCED THEMSELVES AS A SMALL FAMILY FORMER. I LOOKED AROUND THE ROOM AND I THOUGHT. I DON'T KNOW SOMEONE SMOKES ACCOUNT BIG FAMILY FROM WHICH I KNOW HOW I'VE BEEN TO THE FARMS. I SAID TO MADAM VICE PRESIDENT. ISN'T IT INTERESTING THAT WHEN YOU COME TO OUR PART OF THE WORLD. WE HAVE TO INTRODUCE OURSELVES AS SMALL. FAMILY FARMERS. FOR US NOT TO BE PAINTED. WITH THE BRUSH OF CORPORATE ADD EVIL EVIL FARMERS. I THINK IS WHEN I GO TO IT YOU KNOW YOU'RE PART OF THE WORLD UP IN THE BAY AREA. I NEVER HAVE ANYBODY AT GOOGLE OR FACEBOOK INTRODUCED THEMSELVES AS A SMALL FAMILY TECH COMPANY. FOR SOME REASON THEY DON'T HAVE TO APOLOGIZE FOR BEING SUCCESSFUL BIG AND I'LL GO EVEN FURTHER WE DON'T INTRODUCE BILLS LIKE THE ONE MR GARCIA HAD HERE A FEW MINUTES AGO. IMAGINE A BILL THAT SAID IF YOU DON'T. FOLLOW OUR LABOR STANDARDS IN OUR ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS WE WILL ALLOW YOU TO IMPORT COMPUTER CHIPS. HOW WE DOING THAT ANYTIME SOON. ALL PROBABLY NOT. AND THAT BRINGS ME TO YOUR BILL. WHICH AGAIN I WANT TO START BY SAYING THANK YOU I KNOW. YOUR HEART AND YOUR HEAD OR IN THE RIGHT PLACE WITH THE SELF. BUT WE LIVE IN A STATE. WHERE WE SUFFER FROM DROUGHTS AND FLOODS. IN THE SAME YEAR. WHATEVER YOU THINK ABOUT THAT FOR A MINUTE HOW DO YOU SUFFER FROM A DROUGHT IN THE FLOOD. IN THE SAME YEAR. WHY AM AN IDEA. THIS BECAUSE WE'VE BUILT. SO LITTLE WATER STORAGE IN THE LAST FOUR DECADES A 1% INCREASE FOLKS BY THE STATE IN OUR WATER INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE LAST FORTY YEARS AT A TIME WHERE WE MORE THAN DOUBLED. CALIFORNIA'S POPULATION. AND IT'S LIKE ADDITION BY SUBTRACTION WITH THE FOLKS HERE AT THE STATE CAPITOL WHERE WE'RE GONNA TAKE YOUR WATER YOU CAN'T PUMP IT OUT OF THE GROUND YOU CAN'T HAVE FROM THE RIVERS OVER NOT GOING TO BUILD A DAM. BUT WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO EXPECT THE SHELVES TO MIRACULOUSLY PRODUCE FOOD AT WHOLE FOODS. AND OBNOXIOUS PRICES BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO BAN OUT OF STATE STUFF TO. IT'S GET OLD AND- YOU KNOW WHEN THE VOTERS PASSED. CHANGES TO TERM LIMIT LAWS HERE IN CALIFORNIA ACTUALLY ALLOWED SUPPOSED TO STICK AROUND A LITTLE LONGER IN THE SAME HOUSE. HE GAVE THIS BODY SOME CONTINUITY SOME LONGEVITY RIGHT SOME INSTITUTIONAL MEMORY AND AS I SEE HERE THIS MORNING I THINK BACK TO WHEN I WAS FAIRLY NEW AROUND HERE. IT WAS MY SECOND TERM WE DID THE WATER BOND I DON'T THINK YOU WERE HERE YET MISTER CHAIRMAN- ALTHOUGH WE WISH WE'D HAD YOU HERE- AT THAT TIME. BUT WE NEGOTIATED AN AGREEMENT WITH THAT THEN THE A GENTLEMAN WHO WAS CHAIR OF THE WATER COMMITTEE. HAPPENS TO BE SPEAKER THE ASSEMBLY NOW. AND WE MADE AN AGREEMENT WITH THE- AUTHOR. WITH THE GOVERNOR WITH THE SENATE THAT WE'RE GONNA SPEND THREE BILLION DOLLARS A WATER STORAGE. NAMELY TO GET TWO MAJOR STORAGE PROJECTS SITES RESERVOIR ABOVE SACRAMENTO AND TEMPERANCE FLAT. IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY NEITHER OF WHICH- WELL NEITHER OF THOSE PROMISES HAVE BEEN FULFILLED RIGHT AND IN FACT. A CERTAIN INJURY WHY I APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS IF YOU CAN GET TO THE PURPOSE OF THE BILL PLACE Y. GOT AWFUL LOT TO SAY MISTER GERMINOMA I SEE. NO MY FRIEND THE REST. THE BOTTOM LINE IS WE FAILED TO. ACTUALLY INVEST IN AGRICULTURE THE WAY WE SHOULD YOU'VE OBVIOUSLY BROUGHT THIS. PROPOSAL FORWARD I IN EFFORT TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THAT ALTHOUGH ALL SAY THERE'S NOT ANY WATER STORAGE IN THIS WHICH I THINK'S A MAJOR SHORTCOMING. AND MOREOVER THERE'S NOT. SPECIFICITY AND WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS. GETTING INTO SPECIFIC PROJECTS THE REASON I BRING THAT UP IS BECAUSE WILL WHEN THIS BODY ON A BIPARTISAN BASIS VOTED FOR WATER BOND FOR WATER INFRASTRUCTURE AND THOSE PROMISES WERE LATER BROKEN. LACK OF SPECIFICITY LEADS OPPORTUNITY FOR BROKEN PROMISES RIGHT AND SO I GUESS WHAT I WOULD ASK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN. IS IF YOU WOULD BE OPEN I'M NOT PREPARED TO SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY IS IT'S A TWO THIRDS VOTE MY ONE. I WANT TO COME ON BOARD WITH THIS BOND WHEN I KNOW IT'S IN THE QUEUE IN THE- DECISION THAT WE NEEDED TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS THAT I THINK. ARE IMPORTANT FOR MY DISTRICT AND OTHERS- BUT I'D LIKE TO WORK WITH YOU ON THE SPECIFICITY AND HOW WE- DEAL WITH WATER INFRASTRUCTURE BECAUSE AGAIN TO SUFFER FROM FLOODS AND DROUGHTS IN THE SAME YEAR AND I KNOW I'M PREACHING TO THE CHOIR HERE- BUT I WANT TO RAISE THESE ISSUES PUBLICLY. I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR FFORTS TO ADDRESS THESE AND I LOOK FORWARD TO PARTNERING WITH YOU. GOING FORWARD. AT THE YPJ THE COMMENTS AND YOU KNOW CERTAINLY OPEN TO- ENGAGING. OVER THE ISSUE I MEAN IT'S- CERTAINLY- AS- A SIGNIFICANT ONE. SO THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER GRAY MR SHROYER I PROBABLY HAVE A WHOLE LOT LESS TO SEE THE STATUS OF MY DISTINGUISHED COLLEAGUE OF. I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING FORTH THE SAME BASIS- BOND MEASURE OF THE MEMBER SOUTH LA YOU KNOW MANY TIMES PEOPLE QUESTION. ME EVEN ON THIS COMMITTEE- BUT I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THIS- IT'S MEASURES LIKE THIS THAT CAN TRULY MAKE AN IMPACT IN COMMUNITIES LIKE MINE. WHO LACK ACCESS TO FRESH. AND HEALTHY FOOD REALLY BY INVESTING ABOUT SEVENTY FIFTY MILLION TO EXPAND ACCESS TO HEALTHY FOOD- WE ARE FIRM IN OUR COMMITMENT TO COMBAT HUNGER FOR AN ESTIMATED SIX POINT FOUR MILLION CALIFORNIANS.
