FIFTY SIX CORKERY ASSEMBLY BILL FIFTY SIX BY SOMETHING MEMBER EDUARDO GARCIA AND OTHERS AND EXPLAIN TO ELECTRICITY. MR GARCIA YOU MAIL MISTER SPEAKER AND COLLEAGUES GOOD MORNING. RICE TODAY TO PRESENT DAY BE. FIFTY SIX THE BILL THAT WOULD ADDRESS THE FACT THAT NO ONE I THINK DISAGREES WITH. THE NATURE OF ENERGY PROCUREMENT IN CALIFORNIA AND HOW IT'S FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGING. I'D LIKE TO START OFF BY. TALKING A BIT ABOUT THE BILL AS IT RELATES TO WHAT THE BILL DOES NOT DO. GIVEN THE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT ARE PRESENTED THEMSELVES -- VIA THE OPPOSITION -- SHARING WITH MANY OF YOU. THE BILL DOES NOT CHANGE ANY OF THE P. UC'S EXISTING AUTHORITY TO MANDY PROCUREMENT. THIS BILL DOES NOT PASS THE P. YOU SEE WILL STILL BE ABLE TO MANDATE PROCUREMENT OF VARIOUS ENERGY RESOURCES. THROUGH THE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES. THAT'S GOT TO BE MADE VERY VERY CLEAR. THE BILL WILL DO NOTHING. TO INTERFERE AT ALL WITH THE PROCUREMENT. CHOICES OF INDIVIDUAL LOAD SERVING ENTITIES. ALL THE L. S. EASE WILL STILL BE ABLE TO DO PROCUREMENT. AS THEY CURRENTLY DO AND IF THEY MEET THEIR OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE LAW THERE WOULD BE NO NEED FOR ADDITIONAL PROCUREMENT TO BE MANDATED BY THE P. YOU SEE. THIS BILL WILL NOT REQUIRE ANYONE. TO PAY FOR POWER THAT WAS NOT PURCHASED ON THEIR BEHALF. AS IS CURRENT PRACTICE ANY PROCUREMENT MANDATED BY THE P. YOU SEE WHAT HAVE ITS COST ASSIGNED. TO THE CUSTOMERS ON WHOSE BEHALF THAT PROCUREMENT WAS DONE FOR IN FACT. I CHALLENGE ANYONE. TWO POINT TO US WHERE IN THE BILL. IT SAYS THOSE THREE THINGS. AB FIFTY SIX SIMPLY GIVES THE P. YOU SEE THE ABILITY. TO REQUIRE THE CALIFORNIA ALTERNATIVE ENERGY AN ADVANCE TRANSPORTATION. FINANCING AUTHORITY TO PROCURE BACKSTOP POWER AS GAPS ARE IDENTIFIED. TO BE VERY CLEAR AGAIN. THIS BILL DOES NOT PASS. THE PROCUREMENT WILL STILL HAPPEN AT THIS CURRENTLY DONE THROUGH THE I USE. AND WILL BE FORCED TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO ENSURE THAT PROCUREMENT CONTINUES WHEN TWO OR THREE LARGE I'LL USE. EITHER CAN'T OR DON'T WANT TO CONTINUE THAT ROLE. IT I KNOW MANY IF NOT MOST OF YOU HAVE HEARD FROM OUR CCA PARTNERS. FROM YOUR DISTRICT OR STATE WIDE ASSOCIATIONS ALLEGING THAT THIS BILL WILL DISRUPT THEIR ABILITY. WE HAVE BEEN MEETING WITH CC EIGHT STAKEHOLDER SINCE FEBRUARY. AND ARE HOPEFUL THAT WE CAN FIGURE OUT THE DETAILS. TO ENSURE THAT DOES NOT HAPPEN. LET ME SAY UNEQUIVOCALLY. THAT IS THE POSITION THAT WE'VE TAKEN. AND IF THE BILL DOES ANYTHING OTHER THAN WHAT WE'VE SAID IT DOES. WE WILL MAKE SURE. OUT TO ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES OR YOU WON'T SEE THIS BILL COME BACK. FOR CONCURRENCE. IF THAT NEEDS TO BE FURTHER CLARIFIED. I AM HAPPY AND I WELCOME. MANY OF YOU WHO ARE INTERESTED IN THIS SUBJECT. TO HELP US BRING THIS TOGETHER. THIS IS THE RIGHT MOVE FOR CALIFORNIA COLLEAGUES. FOR GREATER RELIABILITY [inaudible] SUSTAINABILITY. TO REACHING OUR AGGRESSIVE CLIMATE CHANGE GOALS IN CALIFORNIA. AND I WANT TO JUST CLOSE BY THINKING MY COLLEAGUE FROM DELMAR FOR SHEPHERDING THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION. IN MY ABSENCE. FOR A FEW OF OUR SESSIONS IN COMMITTEES I WOULD THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR RIVAL TAKE THIS GARCIA DOCTOR QUIRK. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. SO I RISE IN SUPPORT OF AB. FIFTY SIX WE HAVE ALREADY HAD SITUATIONS [inaudible] BECAUSE THAT. HE INDEPENDENT SYSTEM OPERATOR HAS SEEN THAT WE DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH ENERGY. TO KEEP ELECTRICITY ON WHAT THEY DO THEN. IS TO CONTRACT ON A SHORT TERM BASIS WHAT ARE CALLED. RELIABILITY MUST RUN RMR CONTRACTS. THESE ARE EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE. WHAT THIS PROCUREMENT WOULD DO WOULD BE TO SAY IF THE I. S. O. SEES A PROBLEM ON THE GRID? THAT YOU CAN ENTER INTO A LONG TERM CONTRACT WHICH IS MUCH CHEAPER THAN WHAT WE'RE DOING NOW. RELIABILITY MUST RYAN IS EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE IT DOESN'T ALLOW IN FACT FOR EVEN THESE PLANTS TO PLAN AHEAD. IN ANY WAY IT DOESN'T ALLOW FOR MAINTENANCE AT CETERA. THIS IS A FAR BETTER WAY OF LOOKING AT BACK UP. THEN USE DEBATE. THERE WE ARE IN A TRANSITION. FROM PREDOMINANTLY THE INDEPENDENT. OUR SHE'S ME FROM THE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES TO THE COMMUNITY CHOICE AGGREGATORS. SOMETIMES THINGS FALL THROUGH THE CRACKS. RIGHT NOW THOSE CRACKS ARE BEING MAINTAINED THROUGH SHORT TERM VERY EXPENSIVE CONTRACTS. THIS WOULD ALLOW WHEN THE I SO SEES A CRACK HAVE A LONGER TERM CRANCH CONTRACT. UNTIL THIS CAN BE SOLVED BY THE ENERGY PURCHASERS PREDOMINANTLY THE THE COMMUNITY CHOICE AGGREGATORS. I URGE YOU TO BRING THIS BILL ON TO THE SENATE. ARM. AND THE STE THE COMMUNITY TRIES AGGREGATORS OF AS THE THE AUTHOR HAS SAID. WE'LL BE ABLE TO GO OVER THIS LANGUAGE AND MAKE SURE THAT IT'S DOING EXACTLY WHAT I SAY. THAT IS WHEN THERE IS A CRACK IT GETS FILLED AND IT GETS FILLED IN A WAY WHICH IS CHEAPER THAN WHAT WE'RE DOING NOW. SO PLEASE HELP THIS BILL GET ON TO THE SENATE. WHERE THE COMMUNITY CHOICE AGGREGATORS CAN MAKE SURE THAT THE BILL DOES WHAT I'VE JUST SAID AND WHAT THE AUTHOR SAYS IT JUST SAID THANK YOU? THANK YOU DOCTOR QUIRK MISTER MERCY G. YOUR RECOGNIZE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I RISE A RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL. THIS BILL CAME BEFORE THE UTILITIES AND ENERGY COMMISSION -- COMMITTEE. WHERE THE AUTHOR WHO WE ALL KNOW? IT -- LIKES TO TAKE ON BIG BILLS AND PUTS IN THE WORK NECESSARY. TO TO A PRODUCE GOOD POLICY. NONE THE LESS YOU KNOW I'M CONCERNED THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT [inaudible] PROCUREMENT MANDATES. THERE IS. SIGNIFICANT AMBIGUITY THAT HAS NOT BEEN CLEARED UP SINCE THE UTILITIES COMMITTEE HEARING. AND I'M LOOKING AT THE OPPOSITION LIST HERE.

AND I DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS A UPDATED LESS THIS IS ALL THE INFORMATION THAT I HAVE. BUT THIS IS BEING SUPPORTED BY THE BIOMASS ALLIANCE AS BEING OPPOSED BY SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON. BY ALL OF THE CCA'S BY THE CLEAN POWER ALLIANCE OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA IN PARTICULAR. THE LARGEST CCA INSTEAD OF CALIFORNIA. AS WELL AS SILICON VALLEY LEADERSHIP GROUP I THINK THERE'S REASON FOR CONCERN HERE. I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT. MEMBERS WERE AWARE OF THAT THIS IS A AND BUSINESS BILL WITH A LOT OF ON UNANSWERED QUESTIONS. I THINK. PROCUREMENT SHOULD BE LEFT TO THE GROWING MOVEMENT OF OUR COMMUNITY CHOICE AGGREGATORS WHO ARE EXPECTED PROVIDE UP 280% OF OUR ENERGY. IN THE NEAR FUTURE. THANK YOU MISTER MURATSUCHI MISS BURKE YOU ARE RECOGNIZED I I RISE IN SUPPORT OF AB FIFTY SIX THIS IS FOR CLARIFICATION THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT MANDATE -- THIS IS CENTRALIZED PROCUREMENT THAT IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF OUR UTILITIES SYSTEM MOVING FORWARD AS THE SYSTEM MOVES FORWARD AS IT EVOLVES WE ARE GOING TO NEED CENTRALIZED PROCUREMENT IN THE EVENT THAT OTHER. THINGS LIKE P. GENIES SITUATIONS HAPPEN AGAIN WHERE PROCUREMENT MAY BECOME AN ISSUE WE DO NEED A DEFAULT AB CENTRALIZED PROCUREMENT OF LAST RESORT.

TO COMMUNITIES PARTICULARLY THOSE OF COLOR AND LOW INCOME LIKE MINE WHO LIVE ALONG THE COAST SEE THIS THE MOST. WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT HER PLASTIC WASTE AND IT'S TIME THAT WE TAKE A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH AS A STATE TO DEALING WITH IT. AB TEN EIGHTY WOULD ENSURE CALIFORNIA'S ON THE FOREFRONT OF REDUCING POLLUTION FROM SINGLE USE PACKAGING AND PRODUCTS BY ESTABLISHING A COMPREHENSIVE GOAL OF REDUCING OUR WASTE. FROM THESE ITEMS 275% BY TWENTY THIRTY THREE SOURCE REDUCTION AND RECYCLING SPECIFICALLY THOSE MADE OF PLASTIC. THE BILL WOULD DIRECT CAL RECYCLED TO DEVELOP REGULATIONS ON SINGLE USE PACKAGING AND THE TOP TEN PRIORITY SINGLE USE PLASTIC ITEMS BASED ON LETTER SURVEYS REQUIRE MANUFACTURERS TO SOURCE REDUCE THESE ITEMS TO EXTENT FEASIBLE AND ENSURE THAT THEY ARE FULLY RECYCLABLE OUR COMPOSTABLE. THE PACKAGING A PRIORITY SINGLE USE ITEMS THE BILL ALSO REQUIRES MANUFACTURERS TO MEET INTERIM RECYCLING GOALS OF 20% BY TWENTY TWENTY FOUR WHICH WE KNOW SOME INDUSTRIES CAN ALREADY MEET. AND FORTY CENT PERCENT BY. TWENTY TWENTY EIGHT COLLEAGUES THIS EXACT PIECE OF LEGISLATION PASSED THE SENATE YESTERDAY WITH BIPARTISAN SUPPORT IT'S IMPORTANT AS WE MOVE THESE BILLS FOR IT AND THERE WILL BE CONTINUED DISCUSSION.

MISTER CALDERON [inaudible] YOUR RECOGNIZE [inaudible] THANK YOU. MISTER SPEAKER IS A MEMBERS TODAY I'M PROUD TO RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. IT'S IMPERATIVE THAT WE ACT RIGHT NOW TO REDUCE OUR RELIANCE ON SINGLE USE PLASTIC CYNOSURE THAT PLASTICS. WE ARE USING ARE RECYCLABLE AND COMPOSTABLE THIS BILL SAYS LOFTY GOALS FOR CALIFORNIANS. BUT OUR INDUSTRIES AND CITIZENS ARE FULLY CAPABLE OF RISING TO MEET THEM. PLASTIC ITEMS CAN BE FOUND LETTER THREE OUT THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. BEAUTIFUL COASTLINE THE BE SEEN OUR LANDFILLS AND OUR WATER WAYS. BUT PLASTIC WASTE THAT GETS DISCARDED INTO THE ENVIRONMENT DAMAGES ECOSYSTEMS AND MARINE LIFE IT CONTAINS A CONTAMINATES OUR FOOD SUPPLY AND CAN LEAD TO CHEMICAL LEACHING. EXPOSURE TO THESE PLASTICS ARE AND ASSOCIATED TOXINS HAS BEEN LINKED TO CANCER BIRTH DEFECTS IMPAIRED IMMUNITY ENDOCRINE DISRUPTION AND OTHER SERIOUS HEALTH PROBLEMS. ADDITIONALLY PLASTICS NEGATIVELY IMPACTS MARINE ECOSYSTEMS AND WILDLIFE COUNTLESS SEA BIRDS TURTLES MARINE MAMMALS WHALES AND DOLPHINS DIE FROM INGESTION AND DIDN'T OR ENTANGLEMENT. I MEAN HOW MANY TIMES WE HAVE TO LOOK AT TWITTER TURN ON THE NEWS TO FIND A DEAD WHALE HAS ROLLED UP ON A BEACH WITH A STOMACH FULL OF THIRTY POUNDS OF PLASTIC. RESEARCHERS ANTICIPATE A 40% INCREASE IN PLASTIC PRODUCTION OVER THE NEXT DECADE AT WHICH POINT PLASTIC PRODUCTION WILL ACCOUNT 420% OF GLOBAL FOSSIL FUEL CONSUMPTION. A LOT OF TIMES WE HEAR THIS ARGUMENT THAT WERE CALIFORNIA SO DOES MAKE SENSE WE DO THIS BECAUSE WE REPRESENT SUCH A SMALL PIECE OF THE PROBLEM WITH THAT'S A RIDICULOUS ARGUMENT BECAUSE WE ARE A LEADER WE ARE A TREND SETTER. WHAT WE DO MATTERS NOT JUST ON A NATIONAL LEVEL BUT ON THE INTERNATIONAL LEVEL SO THE DECISIONS WE MAKE THE TONES WE SAT? IS WHAT IS IMPORTANT IN TERMS OF CHANGING THE CONVERSATION AROUND ITEMS LIKE SINGLE USE PLASTICS THAT ARE IN OUR FOOD SUPPLY AND THAT ARE DAMAGING OUR ENVIRONMENT AND HAVING A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT. NOT MAYBE NECESSARILY THOROUGHLY UNDERSTOOD HOW SIGNIFICANT OF AN IMPACT THAT THEY'RE HAVING ON US ESPECIALLY WHEN WE'RE CONSUMING THEM IN OUR FOOD THIS BILL SETS GOALS THAT WILL PROTECT HUMAN AND WILDLIFE HEALTH. REDUCE CLEANUP COST IN OUR RELIANCE ON FOSSIL FUELS RESTORE ECOSYSTEMS AND REVITALIZE RESOURCE DEPENDENT COMMUNITIES.

HOW MUCH OF A CRISIS THAT WE HAVE BUT WE HAVE NOT BEEN ACTING AS THOUGH WE HAVE A CRISIS? I'LL TELL YOU WHAT WE DON'T HAVE WE DO NOT HAVE A CRISIS OF TECHNOLOGY. WE HAVE TECHNOLOGY THAT IS PERFECTLY CAPABLE OF MANUFACTURING RECYCLABLE ITEMS. THAT ARE EASY TO RECYCLE. AND A RECYCLING THOSE ITEMS WHAT WE HAVE HAD IS A CRISIS A POLITICAL WILL TO REQUIRE THAT OF MANUFACTURERS. WE KNOW THAT CHINA AND THE OTHER THREAD THIRD WORLD COUNTRIES THAT HAVE BEEN WE HAVE BEEN DUMPING OUR GARBAGE ON FOR YEARS NO LONGER ARE GOING TO TAKE OUR GARBAGE. IN FACT JUST THIS MORNING I READ THAT MALAYSIA IS ACTUALLY SENDING PLASTIC WASTE BACK TO UNITED STATES. THEY ARE PUTTING THEM ON BOATS. ON FREIGHTERS POWERED BY DIRTY DIESEL OF COURSE AND SENDING THEM RIGHT BACK TO US. WE HAVE A LOUD SHIPPERS AND MANUFACTURERS TO LITERALLY DUMPED GARBAGE AND PLASTIC INTO OUR COMMUNITY AND WHO DO WE EXPECT TO BEAR THE COST OF THAT WASTE. OUR RESIDENTS. WHO ARE GOING TO SEE VERY LARGE INCREASES IN THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT THEY PAY? FOR THEIR TRASH. AND THEN THEY'RE GOING TO BLAME US FOR THAT. WE HAVE ALLOWED MANUFACTURERS. OFF THE HOOK FOR FAR TOO LONG THEY SHOULD TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE PRODUCTS THAT THEY CREATE. THEY SHOULD MAKE SURE THAT WHATEVER PRODUCTS THEY PUT OUT ARE NOT JUST TECHNOLOGICALLY RECYCLABLE IN A LABORATORY BUT PRACTICALLY IN EASILY RECYCLED OUT IN THE FIELD. WE HAVE THE TECHNOLOGY TO DO THAT WE'VE ONLY HAD A POLITICAL LACK OF WILL. WELL OUR CHILDREN ARE DEMANDING MORE FROM US ARE DYING OCEANS ARE PAYING TESTAMENT TO OUR FAILURE.

ASSEMBLY BILL SIXTEEN ELEVEN BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER DAVID CHIU AND EXPLAIN TO HEALTH CARE COVERAGE MR CHIU. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER COLLEAGUES APPRECIATE YOUR CONSIDERATION OF AB SIXTEEN ELEVEN WHICH WOULD AND SURPRISE BILLING IN EMERGENCY ROOMS IN CALIFORNIA. IF YOU HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE YOU WOULD THINK THAT IF YOU NEED EMERGENCY ROOM CARE YOU'D BE COVERED. BUT UNFORTUNATELY YOU'RE BROUGHT TO THE WRONG HOSPITAL YOU COULD BE SURPRISED BY AN EXORBITANT BALANCE BILL THE BILL FOR THE BALANCE BETWEEN WHAT A HOSPITAL WANTS TO BE PAID AND WHAT INSURANCE HAS PAID. UNFORTUNATELY THIS IS SOMETHING THAT COULD IMPACT SOME SEVEN MILLION CALIFORNIANS AND WE ALL KNOW THAT IF YOU'RE UNDERGOING A LIFE THREATENING CONDITION YOU DON'T HAVE THE WHERE WITH ALL. TO DECIDE WHAT HOSPITAL TO GO. TO THIS BILL WOULD PROTECT PATIENTS IN ALL CIRCUMSTANCES FROM SURPRISE BOUNCE BILLING RELATED TO MERGE THE ROOM VISITS. INSURED PATIENTS WOULD ONLY -- THEIR CO PAYMENT OR DEDUCTIBLE TO RECOUP OTHER COSTS THE HOSPITAL INSURANCE COMPANY WOULD HAVE PROPOSED STANDARDIZED NEGOTIATIONS SO THAT THERE IS SOME PREDICTABILITY IN THE PROCESS. WE'VE TAKEN MANY AMENDMENTS THROUGH SEVERAL COMMITTEES TO BRIDGE THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN PATIENTS IN HOSPITALS ADDRESSING MANY OF THE CONCERNS OF HOSPITALS I'M COMMITTING THAT WE'RE GONNA WORK CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS BILL IN THE SENATE. WILL BE MAKING AMENDMENTS IN THE SENATE AND THIS BILL WILL COME BACK FOR A CONCURRENCE VOTE. IN CLOSE AFTER A MEDICAL EMERGENCY THE ONLY THING A PATIENT SHOULD HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT IS HOW TO GET BETTER NOT WHETHER A HOSPITAL BILL COULD% LEAD TO FINANCIAL RUIN WITHOUT A RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR MY VOTE. HEY RICH JUNE. DOCTOR WOULD YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS I RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. WE DEALT WITH THE ISSUE IN GENERAL AROUND SURPRISE BILLING -- FOR FOR ALMOST EVERYTHING RELATED TO MEDICAL CARE IN TWO THOUSAND AND SIXTEEN AND IT WAS A REALLY DIFFICULT REALLY DIFFICULT PROJECT. AND IT WASN'T PERFECT AND ONE OF THE THINGS WE DIDN'T ADDRESS WAS EMERGENCY ROOMS. AND IT'S CLEAR NOW THAT WE NEED TO ADDRESS THAT. I KNOW THAT NOBODY WANTS A SURPRISE BILL YOU GOT YOU YOU DON'T HAVE IT CERTAINLY AT TIMES YOU DON'T HAVE CONTROL OF WHERE YOU GO. WITH RELATED TO AN EMERGENCY MIGHT BE TAKEN THERE BY AMBULANCE OR FAMILY MEMBER YOU MIGHT BE OUT OF TOWN. IT'S SIMPLY NOT FAIR THAT IF YOU'RE NOT PART OF A NETWORK THAT YOU GET PAID YOU GET THIS EXORBITANT BILL AT THE END OF THE DAY. I UNDERSTAND THERE'S ANGST ABOUT THE SECOND PART OF THE BILL WHICH IS POTENTIALLY LOOKING AT SETTING RATES -- FOR SOME OF THE SERVICES AND I WOULD SAY THAT. WE NEED TO LET THIS BILL MOVE FORWARD AND WE NEED TO LOOK CONTINUE TO LOOK AT THAT PART OF THE BILL I THINK THAT THERE AYE THERE MAY BE VALID CONCERNS. THIS GIVES ALL HOSPITALS AN OPPORTUNITY TO SHOW WAS THE DATA SHOW WAS THE REASONS SHOW US WHAT YOU WHAT YOU MAY GAIN OR WHAT YOU MAY LOSE FROM THIS BILL. SO WE CAN ACTUALLY WORK WITH YOU ON A SOLUTION EVERY TIME WE TRY TO DO ANYTHING AROUND AFFORDABILITY OR TRYING TO LEVEL OUT COSTS. IT'S THE END OF THE WORLD FOR WHOEVER MIGHT BE AFFECTED. SO. WE NEED TO HAVE PEOPLE ACTUALLY PROVE THE IT'S PRETTY SHOW IT SHOWS THE INFORMATION GIVE US THE OPPORTUNITY REACT JUST SAYING THIS IS GONNA BE BAD FOR US AND BAD FOR HOSPITALS. IS NOT ACCEPTABLE LOT OF PATIENTS ARE GETTING BILLS THAT THEY SIMPLY DON'T DESERVE AND I THINK THIS IS A THIS DEFICIT BILLS A STEP FORWARD I WANT TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR ON THIS. IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT WHEN IT COMES BACK ON CONCURRENCE YOU DON'T HAVE TO VOTE FOR IT. BUT GIVE THIS GIVE THIS -- PROCESS AN OPPORTUNITY TO PLAY OUT LET US PROTECT PATIENTS FROM SURPRISE MEDICAL BILLS E. OURS AND GIVE AND GIVE US A CHANCE TO WORK THROUGH THIS I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR I'VE A THANK YOU DOCTOR WOULD MEMBERS AS PLEASE KEEP THE VOLUME LEVEL MANAGEABLE. IN THE CHAMBER SO WE GET ALL HERE THE DEBATE BEFORE THE BODY IS POWER QUE AND YOUR RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS I RISE IN SUPPORT OF AB -- SIXTEEN ELEVEN AFTER THE PASSAGE OF OUR COLLEAGUE FROM ALAMEDA IS BILL THAT DEALT WITH BALANCE BILLION HOSPITALS I ARRIVED IN IN IN NETWORK HOSPITAL TO BE TREATED BY AN ANESTHESIOLOGIST I NEVER MATT WHO IS OUT OF NETWORK. I RECEIVED A BILL THAT WAS WELL BEYOND ANYTHING I EXPECTED THAT I COULDN'T AFFORD. AND I WAS SHOCKED I DIDN'T REALIZE WHEN YOU SHOP IN NETWORK HOSPITAL YOU CAN BE TREATED BY AN OUT OF NETWORK COSTS DOCTOR YOU'VE NEVER EVEN MATS. AND THANKS TO THE BILL THAT THIS BODY PASSED I WAS ABLE TO CALL AND GET IT CORRECTED AND I ONLY HAD TO PAY THE RATES THE MY INSURANCE GUARANTEED. AND SO I HAVE BENEFITTED FROM THE WORK ON THIS SUBJECT THAT THIS BODY HAS DONE AND SO I URGE YOU TO SUPPORT THIS BECAUSE THERE'S NO REASON THAT SOMEONE WHO SHOWS UP IN THE EMERGENCY ROOM. AND EXPERIENCE IS THE SAME THING I EXPERIENCE SHOULD HAVE TO PAY AN EXORBITANT AMOUNT OF MONEY JUST BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THEY WERE GETTING. AND I UNDERSTAND THE CONCERNS ABOUT THE SECOND PART THE BILL I APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S CONTINUED COMMITMENT TO WORK ON THE RATE SETTING PORTION AND I TRUST HIM TO DO SO BUT I THINK THIS IS AN IMPORTANT PIECE OF LEGISLATION. THAT PROTECTS CALIFORNIANS SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE THAT. MISTER MURATSUCHI YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU VERY MUCH I I ALSO RISE IN SUPPORT OF AB. SIXTEEN ELEVEN YOUR COLLEAGUES I THINK -- WHERE WE'RE SEEING IN WASHINGTON THAT -- THERE IS GROWING BY PARTISAN MOVEMENT TO FIGHT BACK AGAINST SURPRISE MEDICAL BILLS THIS IS PART OF THAT EFFORT. WHILE I I I TRUST MY MY SEAT MADE WELCOME WILL CONTINUE TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE THE THE ISSUES THAT REMAIN WE NEED TO PUSH ON THE HOSPITAL INDUSTRY -- IN ORDER. TO TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE OF SURPRISE MEDICAL BILLS IT'S IMPORTANT BILL TRANSFERS SUPPORT. THANK YOU MISTER MURATSUCHI SEEING NO OTHER MEMBERS SEEKING RECOGNITION ON THIS ITEM. MR CHIU YOU MAY CLOSE THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS OF THE CHAMBER HEALTH COMMITTEE -- THE PERSONAL STORY FORMER COLLEAGUE BRENDA -- OUR COLLEAGUE FROM TORRANCE. I STARTED DIGGING IN THIS ISSUE WHEN WE DISCOVERED IN OUR CITY THERE WERE THOUSANDS OF PATIENTS IN RECENT YEARS WITH AN EMERGENCY BOUNCE BUILD EVEN THOUGH. THEY HAD INSURANCE IN EVERY ONE OF OUR DISTRICTS IN EVERYONE OF OUR DISTRICTS WE HAVE INDIVIDUALS WHO UNFORTUNATELY ARE EXPERIENCING THIS AGAIN SEVEN MILLION CALIFORNIANS HAVE INSURANCE BUT IF THEY GET SENT TO THE WRONG EMERGENCY ROOM. THEY CAN GET A BILL FOR TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS IN SOME INSTANCES SEVERAL HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS. I LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUE THE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE HOSPITALS AND OTHERS TO GET TO THE RIGHT SOLUTION ON THIS THIS IS HARD BUT WERE ASKING YOU TO DO TODAY IS CAST A VOTE. FOR THOSE PATIENTS WHO EITHER HAVE BEEN BOUNCE BUILT OR COULD BE BALLOTS BUILT. TO GIVE US THE OPPORTUNITY TO HOPEFULLY GET TO THE RIGHT PLACE WE'RE ALMOST THERE -- AND WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU.

TWENTY FOUR AB EIGHT FIFTY SEVEN BY MISTER DAVID CHIU CLERK WILL READ. AT SOME LEVEL EIGHT FIFTY SEVEN BY SOMETHING MEMBER DAVID CHIU AND OTHERS AND ACTUALLY THE PUBLIC BANKS. MR CHILL. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER COLLEAGUES APPRECIATE YOUR CONSIDERATION OF AB EIGHT FIFTY SEVEN AS WELL SO MANY CONVERSATIONS WE'VE HAD WITH MANY OF YOU THREE THREE COMMITTEES AND MANY MOMENTS ALONG THE WAY. FOR SOME I KNOW THIS IS A NEW IDEA BUT IT'S MODELED AFTER AN OLD IDEA AFTER THE PUBLIC BANK OF NORTH DAKOTA. WHICH ENJOY THAT'S ONE HUNDRED YEAR ANNIVERSARY SUCCESS THIS YEAR AS WELL AS PUBLIC BANKS AND OTHER COUNTRIES. OUR BILL DOES NOT ESTABLISH A PUBLIC BANK IT SIMPLY CREATES A PROCESS FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO CHARTER PUBLIC BANK A LONG MULTI YEAR PROCESS WITH MANY REGULATORY HURDLES. ARE BILL REQUIRES A LOCAL GOVERNMENT BE OF A CERTAIN SIZE BEFORE APPLYING FOR BANKING CHARTER WE TOOK AMENDMENTS TO EXCLUDE SPECIAL DISTRICTS AND REQUIRES SMALLER COUNTIES. TO FORM GPAS. MAYBE YOU ASKED US QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW WE ENSURE THAT PUBLIC BANK ASSETS ARE SAFEGUARDED UNLIKE PRIVATE BANKS ARE BILL REQUIRES A PUBLIC BANK TO ABIDE BY A FIDUCIARY DUTY. TO PROTECT ITS ASSETS REQUIRING COMPLIANCE WITH ALL REQUIREMENTS OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ON BANKING LAW WITH ALL REPORTING AND TRANSPARENCY REQUIREMENTS. ARE BILL ALSO REQUIRES A PUBLIC BANKS KEEP THE SAME COLLATERAL QUORUM IT'S AS PRIVATE BANKS. WE ESTABLISHED AMENDMENTS WE ACCEPTED AMENDMENTS TO REQUIRE PUBLIC BANK MAINTAIN FDIC DEPOSIT INSURANCE AND TO CONDUCT A FEASIBILITY STUDY AND HAVE A FULLY BLOWN. BUSINESS PLAN THAT ANALYZES COSTS CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS IN THE GALLERY WHEN APPLYING FOR A BANKING CHARTER. ALSO WANNA SAY WE ARE ENGAGED VERY DEEPLY WAS STAKEHOLDER SUCH AS CREDIT UNIONS AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND ARE HOPEFUL THAT THESE CONVERSATIONS WILL MAKE THE BILL EVEN BETTER IN THE SENATE. I WANT TO THANK THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE THAT REMOVED OUR BILL BECAUSE OF ALL THE MEMBERS SO WE'VE TAKEN FROM ITS JOB KILL A LIST. AND OF COURSE I WANT TO THANK THE ONE HUNDRED PLUS ORGANIZATIONS THAT HAVE COME ON IN SUPPORT OF A BILL. AND A PARTICULAR WANT TO THANK ALL OF OUR JOINT AUTHORS BUT BUT MARK MY COLLEAGUE FROM LOS ANGELES WHO HAS BEEN A TREMENDOUS PARTNER ON MOVING THIS BILL AND WITHOUT A RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN. MS WICKS YOUR RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND AND COLLEAGUES I RISES A A PROUD CO AUTHOR OF AB. EIGHT FIVE SEVEN AB EIGHT FIVE SEVEN PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY FOR LOCAL CITIES TO ESTABLISH A PUBLIC BANK SHOULD THEY CHOOSE AND SHOULD THEY GO THROUGH. THE NECESSARY AND CRITICAL HURDLES TO ENSURE THAT THEY HAVE AYE ABILITY TO DO SO DOESN'T REQUIRE THEM TO DO SO JUST GIVES AN OPTION. AND THE THING THAT I VERTICALLY LIKE ABOUT THIS BILL IS THAT -- IT ALLOWS LOCAL INVESTMENTS BY PUBLIC BANK THAT COULD INCLUDE AFFORDABLE HOUSING CLEAN ENERGY AND SMALL BUSINESSES. IT GIVES THE POWER BACK TO THE CONSUMERS THROUGH THIS PUBLIC BANK AND UNLIKE PRIVATE BANKS THAT PRIORITIZE SHAREHOLDER RETURNS. THESE PUBLIC BANKS COULD PROVIDE BENEFITS TO LOCAL COMMUNITIES IN THE RESIDENCE IN WHATEVER THOSE LOCAL COMMUNITIES ONE AND I THINK IT REALLY EMPOWERS THESE LOCAL COMMUNITIES. I WOULD STRONGLY URGE AN AYE VOTE ON ON AB EIGHT FIVE SEVEN APPRECIATE -- THE WORK -- OF MY COLLEAGUES FROM A LOS ANGELES AND SAN FRANCISCO ON THIS. MR MURATSUCHI YOUR RECOGNIZE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I ARM. HAVE HAD COUNT MANY CONVERSATIONS WITH MIGHT MY SEAT MADE ABOUT THIS BILL AND I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT. THAT EVERYONE HERE UNDERSTANDS. IT -- THE THE POTENTIAL ROAD THAT WE'RE GOING DOWN HERE I I'M I'M READING FROM THE LOS ANGELES TIMES EDITORIAL -- THIS TALKING ABOUT HOW. THIS IS FROM MAY TWENTY SEVENTH JUST A FEW DAYS AGO. STATE LEGISLATURE CONSIDERS A BILL TO LET. EIGHT CITIES OPERATE BANKS STUDY SO IT'S A REALLY BAD IDEA. YOU KNOW I DISCORDANT FROM PASSAGES OF OF THE OP ED. FEASIBILITY STUDIES HAVE REPEATEDLY FOUND THAT A PUBLIC BANK WOULD BE TOO EXPENSIVE FOR GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND TOO RISKY FOR TAXPAYERS WHILE ALSO DELIVERING QUESTIONABLE VALUE VALUE TO THE COMMUNITY. COUNTLESS PUBLIC BANK PROPOSALS HAVE BEEN ABANDONED OVER THE YEARS BECAUSE BANKING IS REALLY EXPENSIVE COMPLICATED IN RISKY BUSINESS [inaudible] YOU KNOW. I I THINK MOST OF US ALREADY HAVE OUR MINDS MADE UP AS AS TO HOW WE WANT TO VOTE ON THIS BUT I JUST WANT TO SHARE. YOU KNOW TO CAUTIONARY TALES. IN A ONE I THINK IS IS IS PROBABLY BETTER KNOWN IN ORANGE COUNTY WHEN THEY WHEN THEY TRY. TO RAISE FUNDS WITHOUT RAISING TAXES THEY THEY STARTED ENGAGING AND AND BOND TRADING. AND THAT WILL LEAD TO THE ORANGE COUNTY GOING TO BANKRUPTCY. AND IN MY OWN DISTRICT IN THE CITY OF GARDENA. THEY THOUGHT IT WOULD BE A GREAT IDEA. TO FORM A MUNICIPAL INSURANCE. COMPANY. YOU KNOW THEY THOUGHT THAT THEY CAN -- YOU KNOW. CIRCUMVENT THE FOR PROFIT MOTIVES OF OF INSURANCE OF PRIVATE INSURANCE COMPANIES AND TO PROVIDE THEIR COMMUNITY SERVICE. WELL IT ENDED UP BEING A HUGE FINANCIAL DEBACLE. BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE EXPERTISE. YOU KNOW THE THE THE THE THE MOTIVATIONS FOR PUBLIC ENTITIES ARE ARE. ARE -- YOU KNOW DIFFERENT FOR BETTER OR WORSE -- AND IT GOT THEM IN THE CITY BANK OF GUARDINO ALSO ALMOST ENTERED INTO BANKRUPTCY [inaudible] AND SO. YOU KNOW AS WE VOTE ON THIS BILL I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT -- YOU KNOW I I KNOW THAT THIS IS TREMENDOUSLY POPULAR ESPECIALLY WITH THE WITH THE OUR OUR OUR PROGRESSIVE FRIENDS -- BUT WE WE OPEN WE GO INTO THIS WITH OUR EYES WIDE OPEN. WE STUDY THE HISTORY WE LOOK AT THE CAUTIONARY TALES -- I WE MAKE OUR OUR VOTES THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER MURATSUCHI MS KAMLAGER-DOVE. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I DO WANT TO ECHO THE CONCERNS RAISED BY MY COLLEAGUE FROM THE SOUTH BAY -- CONCEPTUALLY THIS. IS A REALLY GOOD IDEA BUT I THINK IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT THAT WE CONSIDER -- THE REALITIES BEFORE US ACROSS -- THIS STATE -- AND I HAVE A LOT OF CONCERNS ABOUT THIS BILL BECAUSE IT WILL FOLLOW FDIC REGULATIONS THAT MEANS THAT ALL OF THOSE IN THE CANNABIS MARKETS WILL STILL BE ON ABLE TO PARTICIPATE. IN THESE BANKS IF YOU HAVE A PUBLIC BANK DOES THAT MEAN THAT YOU ARE ALSO WILL IT HAVE CITY EMPLOYEES THAT ARE WORKING FOR IT OR WILL IT JUST BE -- WILL THOSE THAT ARE HIRED WILL BE EMPLOYEES JUST BE FROM THE CITY OR THERE'S JURISDICTION -- UNDER WHICH THE BANK IS FOUNDED SO ARE YOU INCREASING BUREAUCRACY OR NOT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT HELPING THE UNDER BANKED IN THE ON BANKS BE ABLE TO OPEN AN ACCOUNT. BUT THOSE -- POTENTIAL -- CLIENTS OF A BANK STILL HAVE TO ABIDE BY THE CRITERIA SET BY FEDERAL LAWS SO HOW WILL THESE PUBLIC BANKS ENSURE THAT THOSE FOLKS WHO ARE UNBANKED AND UNDER BANKED GET CERTAIN KINDS OF ACCOMMODATIONS. TO ALLOW THEM TO BANK I WOULD BE REALLY CONCERNED IF WE DID THIS AND YOU LOOKED UP AND YOU SAW THAT THERE ARE ONLY CITY BANKS IN CERTAIN COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE. AND THOSE COMMUNITIES LIKE MINE IN SOUTH LA WHO PROBABLY DESPERATELY NEED A COMMUNITY BANK LIKE THIS WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO HAVE ONE OPEN. SO I THINK AS WE CONTINUE TO TALK ABOUT THESE ISSUES WE AND THEN ONCE AGAIN WHAT ABOUT THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS FOR BANKS HOW ARE THOSE FOLKS BEING SELECTED WILL THOSE BE POLITICAL SELECTIONS WILL THEY BE SELECTED BY THE CITY MANAGER -- OR THE MAYOR -- I THINK THESE ARE REAL ISSUES THAT WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO WORK OUT BEFORE WE GO DOWN THIS ROAD SO I WOULD JUST ASK FOR YOUR FOLKS TO REALLY CONSIDER THOSE CONCERNS WHILE PROCESSING HOW THEY'RE GOING TO VOTE FOR THIS BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISS KAMLAGER-DOVE MINS GARCIA YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU I ALSO RISE WITH THE A LOT OF HESITATION FOR THIS POLICY. I HAVE A COMMUNITY THAT HAS A LOT OF UNDER BANKED AND UNBANKED CONSTITUENCY AND I GET THAT THE STARS WANT TO HELP THEM OUT THERE. BUT I ALSO HAVE A COMMUNITY AT THE SPEAKER THAT THE CORRIDOR CORRUPTION. AND HIM AND I SAID TOGETHER MOST RECENTLY SOMEONE MY COUNCIL MEMBERS RENDON USE WE'VE ALL BEEN TALKING ABOUT THAT AGAIN. AND IT'S BEEN THAT WAY SINCE BEFORE I GOT HERE AND IT CONTINUES. OF TALK ABOUT HOW WHILE I'VE BEEN FIGHTING AGAINST THAT FOR THE LAST TEN YEARS I OFTEN FEEL LIKE WE HAVE MOVED BACKWARDS THAT AFFORD. IN THAT SPACE AND SO WE'RE IS ME TO GIVE ANOTHER TOOL TO MY COUNCIL MEMBERS LOCAL LIKE IT'S TO ABUSE. ARE OUT THERE UNDER THE FALSE PRETEXT OF HELPING A COMMUNITY THAT REALLY IF THE NEED AND DOES NEED SOME OF THE SERVICES OUT THERE. THAT'S WERE HAVING THIS DISCUSSION I KNOW IT'S POPULAR WITH A LOT OF INDIVIDUALS OUT THERE I HOPE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE WON'T ABILITIES AND WE'RE TRYING TO FIND SOLUTIONS. TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT JUST GIVING ANOTHER TOOL FOR FOLKS TO STEAL OUR MONEY AND MORE ELECTED OFFICIALS TO A ROAD THE PUBLIC TRUST OUT OF MY COMMUNITY THANK YOU. DOCTOR CHOI YOUR RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU SPEAKER AND THE MEMBERS SIDE RISE SO -- TO OPPOSE SAW A AB -- EIGHT FIFTY SEVEN I DON'T UNDERSTAND THE WHY GOVERNMENT. IS -- NOW TRYING TO AND FOR A COMMERCIAL. ALL MARKET PLAYS SO I THOUGHT THAT WE HAD THE BODY OF A MAKING POLICIES SO. NOW WE CAN NOT ONCE WE START THIS KIND OF A COMMERCIAL ACTIVITIES OF FOR PROFIT. WHY ARE YOU CAN MAKE IT TOUGH FOR NON PROFIT BUT THE? YOU CANNOT OPERATE -- SO TEN NINETY TWO WITHOUT MAKING PROFITS IN THE COMPETING WITH THE ESTABLISH THE COME COMMERCIAL ENTITIES. AND THE NEXT TWO MAY BE -- HEALTH INSURANCE AND NEXT I'M IN THE US ALREADY UP BEING PROPOSED AS SOMEONE PAY UP IN A POLICY. YOU KNOW WE CAN GO ON AND ON NOT THIS KIND OF ACTIVITIES SO AND THAT THIS IS SAW OF SUCH A BAD IDEA. AND THAT WE SHOULD NOT ALLOW SUCH A RISK OF FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO CITIES AND COUNTIES TO EVEN STATE THAT TO ENTER. A SUCH A RISKY BUSINESS ARE AND IN PRINCIPLE OR WE SHOULD NOT TO COMPETE WITH THE IS TABLETS OF COMMERCIAL ESTABLISHMENTS I STRONGLY URGE YOU. TO TO VOTE NO. THANK YOU DON'T CHOI MISTER STONE YOUR RECORD. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS I RISE IN ABSOLUTE SUPPORT OF THIS BILL RECOGNIZE. THEY COUNTIES PERFORM A LOT OF THIS FUNCTION ANYWAY THEY TAKE IN A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF MONEY FROM LOCAL AGENCIES. THEY HOLD ON TO THAT. AND THAT MONEY SITS WITH THE COUNTY. WITHOUT BEING ABLE REALLY TO BE USED TO THE BENEFIT OF OF THE COMMUNITY. THIS IS NOT A REPLACEMENT FOR COMMERCIAL BANKS THIS IS NOT EVEN NECESSARILY. A WAY JUST YET FOR THE CANNABIS INDUSTRY TO GET BAGS WHAT IT IS IS A WAY FOR THE MONEY THAT CITIES AND COUNTIES ARE HOLDING DUE TO THEIR NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS. TO BE ABLE TO USE THAT TO INVEST APPROPRIATELY IN THEIR COMMUNITY. KEEP THAT CAPITAL LOCAL AND MAKE IT WORK. IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A SOLUTION FOR THE UNDER BANKS THIS IS A VERY VIABLE POSSIBILITY IF YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT. THE ORANGE COUNTY AND SOME OF THE OTHER TO BAKUL SAID IT HAPPENED BEFORE REMEMBER THOSE WERE HAPPENING WITH DECISION MAKERS. OPERATING WITHOUT A LOT OF STRUCTURE AROUND THEM FOR ANY REAL OVERSIGHT. THIS PROVIDES A PATH FOR THAT OVERSIGHT PROVIDES A PATH FOR THE MONIES THAT ARE BEING HELD ANYWAY. SOMETIMES HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ACROSS THE STATE WELL ACROSS THE CALIFORNIA MUCH MORE THAN THAT BUT IN A GIVEN COUNTY. POTENTIALLY HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO BE ABLE TO VERY CAUTIOUSLY BE WORKED INTO THE COMMUNITY TO THE BENEFIT OF THAT COMMUNITY. AND FOR ALL THIS IS A VERY VIABLE HAVE. UNDER A STRICT STRUCTURE THAT IS NOT REPLACING LOCAL BANKS IT IS NOT REPLACE IN THE COMMERCIAL SECTOR IT FEELS A VERY DIFFERENT NASH AND IT WILL BE A VERY GOOD A GOOD. USE OF THE MONEY THAT IS COLLECTED ACROSS CALIFORNIA FOR LOCAL REINVESTMENT AND I URGE AND EITHER. THEY WERE STONE DR QUIRK YOUR RECOGNIZE. FIRST OF ALL I I RISE IN OPPOSITION TO A. B. EIGHT FIVE SEVEN REGRETFULLY. I HAVE TREMENDOUS RESPECT FOR THE AUTHOR BUT I JUST DON'T THINK THIS IS A GOOD IDEA ARM. WE ALL REMEMBER -- EIGHT OH NINE WHEN. THIS OP WHEN BANKS -- SUPPOSEDLY WELL MANAGED WENT OUT OF BUSINESS WERE ABSORBED BY OTHER BANKS. OF REMEMBER THE SAVINGS AND LOANS TO BAKUL. EVEN A WELL RUN. BANK IN THE WRONG SITUATION. OUR AND IF YOU PARTICULAR IF YOU INVEST PROJECT PREDOMINANTLY LOCALLY YOU'RE MORE LIKELY TO GET CAUGHT UP. AT THE SAME TIME THAT YOUR TAXES ARE GOING DOWN -- YOUR LOCAL ECONOMY IS GOING DOWN AND IF YOU INVESTED PRIMARILY THERE IT'S JUST TAKING A RISK THAT'S TOO MUCH. NOW IN MY OWN CITY WHILE I WAS ON CITY COUNCIL WE HAD A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. ARE IN. THAT WAS NOT IN RESERVE BUT SIMPLY THAT WE HAD TO KEEP. AND THAT WAS INVESTED VERY CONSERVATIVELY IN THE STATE WIDE FUND THAT THE CITIES AND COUNTIES HAVE AVAILABLE TO THEM. BUT IT'S INVESTED IN. TREASURY BILLS OTHER THINGS THAT ARE EXTREMELY EXTREMELY -- SAFE. AND THAT'S WHERE YOUR MONEY SHOULD BE. NOW IF YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT -- THE FACT THAT YOU'RE INVESTING IN A WALL STREET BANKER YOU'RE SENDING YOUR MONEY TO WALL STREET BANKS. THERE ARE ALTERNATIVES FOR THE CREDIT UNIONS I DON'T KNOW THAT THEY ARE FOR ALL THE SERVICES. THAT MISTER CHIU WOULD LIKE BUT THEY CERTAINLY. DO WORK WITH THE COMMUNITY -- THEY'RE NOT -- MOTIVATED BY THE OUR PROFIT MOTIVE AND THEY HAVE BEEN EXTREMELY SAFE. STABLE AND I WOULD JUST URGE THE OFFER AUTHORED TO THINK ABOUT WORKING WITH THE CREDIT UNIONS WHICH ARE ALREADY WELL ESTABLISHED HAVE A VERY LONG HISTORY OF STABILITY. AND SEE WHAT CAN BE DONE THERE AND WORK WITH THAT INDUSTRY THANK YOU. THANK YOU THAT QUIRK. MR SANTIAGO. I THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS AND I I APPRECIATE THE RIGORS DEBATE. AND LIKE ALL NEW IDEAS SOMETIMES ARE CHALLENGING. LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT THE BILL REALLY DOES AND MOST OF YOU HAVE HEARD FOR ME. A NUMBER OF TIMES THE BILL DOES NOT ESTABLISH BANKS AUTOMATICALLY. IT DOESN'T A PUTS A VERY RIGOROUS PROCESS. A RICH A VERY RIGOROUS PROCESS THAT REQUIRES A FEASIBILITY STUDY. SO IF YOU CAN'T PASS A FEASIBILITY STUDY. YOU CAN'T EVEN MOVE FORWARD. YOU'VE GOT A YOU'VE GOT TO DECLARE A PUBLIC GOOD. AND WHY NOT WHY NOT A BANK THAT WORKS FOR PUBLIC GOOD AND LOCAL AREAS AND REINVEST ARE DOLLARS THAT IS MOTIVATED BY DOING GOOD. RATHER THAN MOTIVATED BY THE BOTTOM LINE. THEN YOU STILL GOT TO FOLLOW ALL FEDERAL LAWS. ALL FEDERAL LAW IS GONNA BE FOLLOWED. YOU'VE GOT TO GO TO THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT BUSINESS OVERSIGHT OFFICE. OOPS I STUMBLE THEIR BUT YOU'VE GOT TO GO THROUGH THAT THAT'S NOT A THAT'S NOT A NEARLY PROCESS THAT YOU GO THROUGH THAT IS A SERIOUS PROCESS. SO A LOT OF THE CONCERNS OF FOLKS THAT SAID I APPRECIATE. BUT YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO GO THROUGH THAT PROCESS. IF YOU HAD SOME OF THOSE PROBLEMS THAT HAVE BEEN THAT HAVE BEEN SUGGESTED ON THE FLOOR. BUT I APPRECIATE THE DEBATE ON THE LAST. YOU HAVE TO BE FDIC INSURED. WE'RE NOT SAYING JUST GO PUT MONIES AT RISK YOU HAVE TO BE FDIC INSURED. AND SOMEONE MENTIONED -- THE LA TIMES ARTICLE. BUT WE APPRECIATE THE RIGOROUS DEBATE. WE DIDN'T HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO REAP BOTTLE BECAUSE WE WERE NEVER CONTACTED. LET'S BE VERY CLEAR THE REPORT THAT THEY POINT TO WAS ABOUT CANNABIS DOLLAR WAS NOT ABOUT THE TYPE OF DOLLARS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. AND AT THE VERY LEAST AT THE VERY LEAST I WOULD SAY. THAT I DON'T THINK REASONABLY. IT IT'S A IT'S A CHALLENGING IDEA TO THINK. THAT WE SHOULD PUSH BIG BANKS TO DO A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT THAT WE SHOULDN'T THINK ABOUT DOING A NEW WAY OF BANKING BECAUSE THE OLD WAY OF BANKING ISN'T NECESSARILY WORKING FOR OUR COMMUNITIES. WE HAVE A HUGE PROBLEM WITH INCOME INEQUALITY HERE IN CALIFORNIA. WE HAVE GOT THE CHALLENGE. BILLIONAIRES AND WALL STREET TO DO SOMETHING A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENTLY. AND LOOK WE'VE GOT A LONG DEBATE IN THE SENATE. HOW MANY IDEAS HAVE WE PUSH THROUGH THIS THROUGH THIS LEGISLATURE THAT ARE NOT BEEN PERFECT? BUT ARE ON THEIR WAY TOWARDS IMPROVING EIGHT AT TOWARDS IMPROVING. THE QUALITY OF LIFE FOR PEOPLE. THIS LEGISLATIVE PROCESS WILL ALLOW US. TO ADDRESS CONCERNS. WILL ALLOW US TO ADDRESS THOSE COMMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE. AND GET TO A FINAL PRODUCT. THAT WILL IMPROVE THE LIVES OF CALIFORNIANS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR NIVEAU. SEEING NO OTHER MEMBERS SEEKING RECOGNITION ON THE ITEM. MR CHIU YOU MAY CLOSE THANK YOU COLLEAGUES VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE RIGOROUS DEBATE -- THIS IS A DEBATE THAT WE'VE BEEN HAVING ALL YEAR -- AND I WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT AND THANK THE BANKING COMMITTEE THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT COMMITTEE THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE FOR PUTTING US AS A SUPPORTERS THIS BILL THROUGH THE PACES TO ADDRESS. THOSE QUESTIONS. I WOULD SUBMIT THAT WE HAVE DONE THAT AND LET ME JUST TAKE A FEW OF THE ISSUES THAT AND REYES FIRST OF ALL WITH REGARDS TO THE POSSIBILITY THE POLITICIZATION OF BANKS. UNLIKE PRIVATE BANKS. WHERE THERE IS NO IF I DO SURE DUE TO THE PUBLIC WE ESTABLISH THAT WITH THIS? THERE'D BEEN QUESTIONS AROUND THE IMPACT OF THIS BILL ON SMALLER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS. SINCE I GRADUATED FROM SCHOOL SOME TWENTY PLUS YEARS AGO. THE LARGEST WALL STREET BANKS HAVE SWALLOWED UP 75% OF CALIFORNIANS LOCAL BANKS. AND THIS BILL. THIS BILL ENVISIONS A PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN ANY LOCAL PUBLIC BANK. AND CREDIT UNIONS AND LOCAL COMMUNITY BANKS JUST AS IS THE MODEL WITH THE BANK OF NORTH DAKOTA WHICH HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL THE FOR THE BETTER PART OF A CENTURY. I WE'VE CERTAINLY HEARD THE CONCERNS ABOUT THE FACT THAT THERE MAY BE SOME LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THAT EITHER DON'T HAVE THE WHERE WITH ALL TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO THIS OR FOR HOME. THEY MAY NOT HAVE THE FINANCIAL LEADERSHIP TO BE ABLE TO DO THIS WE ARE AT THIS MOMENT DISCUSSING AMENDMENTS THAT WE WOULD ACCEPT IN THE SENATE TO ADDRESS. THOSE VERY CONCERNS. BUT LET ME JUST CLOSE BY SAYING WE NEED ANOTHER OPTION THAN WHAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW I THINK EVERYONE KNOWS THAT AT THE MOMENT WE HAVE HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. OF ASSETS BEING HELD BY OUR CITIES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THE ESTIMATE IS SEVEN HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS. THAT IS GOING TO THE LARGEST WALL STREET BANKS IN THE COUNTRY. AND THOSE BANKS ARE INVESTING PUBLIC MONIES. AGAINST OUR CALIFORNIA VALUES IN FOSSIL FUEL INDUSTRIES IN GUN MANUFACTURERS IN PRIZE PRIVATE PRISONS IN COMPANIES WITH UNFAIR LABOR PRACTICES. AND WE KNOW. THAT THESE LARGEST BANKS HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF CONSUMERS WHO ARE EXPERIENCING PREDATORY LENDING WHO HAD MILLIONS OF FAKE BANK ACCOUNTS OPEN IN THEIR NAMES. WHO'VE LOST HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF INTEREST PAYMENTS AFTER THE GREAT RECESSION. WE ALL HAVE LITERALLY MILLIONS OF HOMEOWNERS WHO'VE BEEN VICTIMIZED BY THE MORTGAGE FORECLOSURE CRISIS STUDENTS VICTIMIZED BY GREENLANDERS SMALL BUSINESSES TONIGHT ACCESS TO CAPITAL. THIS IS A BILL TO SUGGEST ANOTHER PATH IT WOULD ALLOW FOR THE POSSIBILITY OF CHARTERING A LOCAL BANK BUT WE ALL KNOW WHAT THE CRITIQUE OF THIS BILL IS. THE REQUIREMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN PLACED ALREADY BY THIS ASSEMBLY IN THIS BILL. COULD LIKELY MAKE IT SO DIFFICULT THAT WOULD BE VERY DIFFICULT FOR ANY LOCAL JURISDICTION TO CREATE A LOCAL BANK BECAUSE WE HAVE ESTABLISHED ALL OF THESE CRITERIAS BUT WHAT WE'RE SAYING TO COLLEAGUES IS.
