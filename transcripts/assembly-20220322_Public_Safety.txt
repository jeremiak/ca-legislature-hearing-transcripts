MY NAME IS MARCO GEORGIAN I'M HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION IN OPPOSITION TO TWENTY AB TWENTY TWENTY SEVEN- WE DEPLORE THE INCREASE IN HATE CRIMES AGAINST ASIAN AMERICANS IN THE WAKE OF THE FORMER PRESIDENT'S. CALLING COPE WITH THE CHINESE FLEW. THE HATE CRIME ENHANCEMENT ALREADY PROVIDES FOR AN ADDITIONAL ONE TO FOUR YEARS IN STATE PRISON FOR ANY FELONY HATE CRIME. LAST YEAR S. B. EIGHTY ONE WAS SIGNED INTO LAW. AT ENACTING ONE OF THE COMMITTEE ON THE- REVISION OF THE PENAL CODES KEY RECOMMENDATIONS THAT JUDGES SHOULD BE GIVEN LEGAL GUIDANCE AND EXERCISING THEIR SENTENCING DISCRETION. A. B. TWENTY TWENTY SEVEN WOULD TAKE THAT AWAY. AB TWENTY TWENTY SEVEN WOULD NOT DETER HATE CRIMES THE STATISTICS CITED BY THE DEPUTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY FROM ORANGE COUNTY ALL OCCURRED BEFORE S. B. S. B. EIGHTY ONE. ACTUALLY WENT INTO EFFECT. BOB RICE LET'S NOT STOPPED BY THE SENTENCING THAT EXISTED PRIOR TO A TO SB EIGHTY ONE. AB TWENTY TWENTY SEVEN WOOD AT IMPOSED A ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH TO HATE CRIME ENHANCEMENT IS CHARGED IN OTHER WORDS IT WOULD MEAN THAT A JUDGE AFTER HEARING ALL THE EVIDENCE AND WEIGHING THE LAWN THE FACTS WOULD BE TAPPED POWERLESS TO DISMISS A HATE CRIME AND AUNTS MEANT EVEN IF THERE WERE WARRANTED BECAUSE THE INDIVIDUAL COMMITTED THE FENCE BECAUSE THEY WERE MENTALLY ILL. THE INDIVIDUAL COMMISSION OF THE CURRENT OFFENSE WAS CONNECTED TO SEXUAL ABUSE SEX TRAFFICKING ANIMATE PARTNER PARTNER VIOLENCE OR CHILDHOOD TRAUMA. THE INDIVIUALS THE JUVENILE WHEN THEY COMMITTED THE CURRENT OFFENSE. IMPOSING THE ENHANCEMENT WOULD RESULT IN A DISCRIMINATORY RACIAL IMPACT. AND I DO WANT TO SAY THAT AS SOMEONE WHO WOULD FIT INTO AT LEAST THREE OF THE CATEGORIES THAT WOULD BE COVERED BY THE HATE CRIME STATUTE BUT IT JUST THINK THIS IS NOT THE WAY A CHILLING MORE CALIFORNIANS SO WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR NO VOTE ON AB TWENTY TWENTY SEVEN. THANK YOU. THANK YOU GOOD MORNING CHEN MEMBERS FRED WILLIAMS ACLU CAL ACTION IN OPPOSITION WHILE THE DESIRE TO DISCOURAGE HATE CRIMES TO A PROTECTED CLASSES LAUDABLE GOAL EXISTING LAW ALREADY PENALIZES HATE BASED OFFENSES WHILE PROVIDING APPROPRIATE JUDICIAL DISCRETION WHEN ENHANCEMENT IS NOT IN THE INTEREST OF JUSTICE JUDICIAL DISCRETION IS ONE THE MOST VITAL ASPECTS OF OUR LEGAL SYSTEM TYING THE HANDS OF JUDGES TO IMPOSE AN UPHOLD SENTENCES THAT THEY BELIEVE ARE ON JUST RUNS COUNTER TO THE MISSION OF THE COURTS. CURRENT LAW STRIKES A BALANCE ALLOWING JUDGES TO IMPOSE SENTENCES IN ORDER TO PROTECT PUBLIC SAFETY WITHOUT LOSING SIGHT OF THE OBLIGATION OF TE COURTS TO ACT FAIRLY. EACH INDIVIDUAL CASE PRESENTS A MULTITUDE OF FACTORS THAT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED BY THE JUDGE. THIS BILL REMOVES TOOL THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS PUT IN PLACE TO CREATE A MORE JUST AND EQUITABLE LEGAL SYSTEM IS FOR THESE REASONS AS YOU'VE GOT ACTION STRONGLY URGES THE NO VOTE.

SAMBA SURE THERE IS NO ONE ELSE HAS SIGNALED THEY WISH TO SPEAK ALL RIGHT THANK YOU WOULD NOW BRING IT BACK. TO THE COMMITTEE FOR COMMENTS QUESTIONS ANSWERS. MISTER MISTER COURT. YES I FIND THIS BILL JUST CONTRADICTORY. EVEN THOUGH THE JUDGE THINKS IT IS FURTHERANCE OF JUSTICE THAT THE ENHANCEMENT BE DISMISSED YOU'RE ASKING. THAT THAT THAT THEY NO LONGER HAVE THAT ABILITY EVEN THOUGH IT'S IN THE FURTHERANCE OF JUSTICE THIS JUST DOES NOT MAKE SENSE TO ME- AND- WHAT IT WOULD RESULT IN IS MORE JAIL TIME. MORE RESOURCES SPENT. ON KEEPING PEOPLE IN JAIL ARE IN PRISON. AS OPPOSED TO. EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS THAT COULD HELP IN THIS AREA. AS OPPOSED TO- TRYING TO HELP PEOPLE WHO HAVE PROBLEMS ARE KEEP FROM RECEIPT OF EIGHTEEN SO THIS JUST DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO ME I'M SORRY I'M GONNA HAVE TO VOTE NOW WE'VE SUGGESTED IN IN THE IN THE COMMENTS HERE THAT THERE'S A CAUSAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SB EIGHTY ONE AND A RISE IN HATE CRIMES OF THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS SB EIGHTY ONE WAS CHAPTER LAST YEAR DIDN'T GO INTO EFFECT UNTIL JANUARY OF THIS YEAR AND SO THE IDEA THAT WE WOULD UNDO A LAW SUGGESTING THAT THERE'S A LOOPHOLE WHEN IT HASN'T EVEN BEEN EFFECT FOR MORE THAN TWO MONTHS I THINK IT'S JUST POOR POLICY. SO I WILL ALSO BE VOTING THANK YOU TO OUR ADDRESS THE OPPOSITION'S OF CONCERNS. AB TWENTY TWENTY SEVEN IF YOU READ CAREFULLY DOES NOT THE- PROHIBITS A JUDGE FROM DISMISSING A HATE CRIME ENHANCEMENT IN THE INTEREST OF A JUSTICE. THIS BILL STATES THAT THE OR JUDGE IT IS- NOT REQUIRED. TO DO SO UNDER THE NEW S. B. EIGHTY ONE LANGUAGE. THE JUDGE IT WOULD RETAIN THE SAME AUTHORITY. DR HE WHY SHE HAS A PRIOR TO JANUARY FIRST OF TWO THOUSAND TWENTY TOOL TO DISMISS TO DISMISS AT THIS ENHANCEMENTS IF YOU WHY HE WHY SHE WANTED TO. BUT THE WITHOUT THE- NERO NERO PRESUMPTION IN FAVOUR BUT THIS MUSCLE LANGUAGE. CALIFORNIA MUST DO MORE AND THEN AB TWENTY TWENTY SEVEN GIVES UP A MESSAGE TO CALIFORNIA HAS A ZERO TOLERANCE OF FULL HE CRIMES ESPECIALLY BASED ON RACIAL WALK COLOR OF THE SKIN. I ASK YOU ALL TO THINK ABOUT THE YOU ALL COMMUNITIES- AND THOSE SO WHO ARE TARGETED SPECIFICALLY FOR THE RACE OF RELIGION SEXUAL ORIENTATION AND KNOW WHO THEY CHOOSE TO LOVE. THAT THE CRIME COMING FROM THE PLACE OF A HATE IS UP ON BLOCKS UP DOUBLE. TO LET THE VICTIMS TO NORMAL WE ARE ON THE SIDE OF A JUSTICE NOT UNDECIDABLE CRY. I RESPECTFULLY ASK WE I'VE WORKED. AND THANK YOU MR JOINER I THINK FOR BRING THIS UP I THINK FOR FAR TOO LONG WE EITHER AS A AS A SOCIETY OR AS A COMMUNITY OR EVEN HERE IN THE CAPITAL WE REALLY HAVEN'T RECOGNIZE ÁP I HATE AND THAT IS NOT SOMETHING IS JUST SPRING UP OVERNIGHT I. BELIEVE IT'S BEEN GOING ON FOR QUITE SOME TIME AND SO THE FACT THAT WE CONTINUE TO TALK ABOUT IT IS REALLY REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT AND I COMMEND YOU FOR BRINGING THIS TO THE FOREFRONT AND BRING IT HERE A TO THIS COMMITTEE. THERE IS A LAW IN PLACE THAT WE WOULD LIKE SPURS GAINERS BILL TO START TO BEGIN I MEAN IT BEGINS IN JANUARY WEARING HERE IN MARCH WE REALLY WOULD LIKE FOR THAT TO BEGIN AND TAKE HOLD IN ADDITION WHEN I CAME TWENTY TWELVE I WILL BE HONEST WITH YOU IF YOU ASK ME WHETHER OR NOT AND- PROMISED GEORGE AND SOME OF THE OTHER FOLKS. THAT WE WOULD GIVE JUDGES DISCRETION OF PROBABLY WOULD IN A LASTING WE WANT TO DO MAINLY BECAUSE WE HAD MANDATORY MINIMUMS AND WE REALLY DIDN'T GIVE THE JUDGES- WE BELIEVE NOW AT LEAST I BELIEVE THAT JUDGES ARE NOW IN THE BEST POSITION WITH ALL EVIDENCE BROUGHT IN TO MAKE THOSE KINDS OF THIS DECISIONS AND NOT TO INHIBIT THEM FROM BEING ABLE TO MAKE THE MOST JUST. DECISIONS POSSIBLE NOT KEEPING THE SCALE ONE WAY OR THE OTHER AND SO UNFORTUNATELY I WILL BE VOTING NO TODAY BUT I DO BELIEVE THAT WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO BRING THIS UP AND AGAIN I COMMEND YOU FOR MAKING SURE THAT- VALUE PROTECT API COMMUNITY BECAUSE ONCE YOU PROTECT API COMMUNITY PROTECT AFRICAN AMERICAN LATINO- IN OTHER COMMUNITIES THAT THE NEW PROTECTION FROM FROM HATE. CRIMES SO. IS THERE A MOTION. MOVED THERE'S A. ON AB TWENTY TWENTY SEVEN BY SEVEN MEMBER CHOI THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE JONES SAWYER JONES SAWYER NO LACKEY. BLACKIE I BONTA FONTANELLE BRIAN- NO BRIAN NO QUIRK QUIRK NO SANTIAGO SEYARTO HI THERE TOO I. I'M SORRY THAT MEASURE FAILS THANK YOU. PASSED THE GAVEL ABOUT REGULATORY CONSIDERATION AS DOES THE AUTHOR WANT THAT THAT ARE. BOTH APPRECIATE THAT OPPORTUNITY FORWARD REQUESTS ARE USUALLY WITHOUT ANY OBJECTION GROUP WILL GRANT RECONSIDERATION UNANIMOUSLY THANK YOU. SO I NEED TO MAKE A I NEED TO PRESENT SOME OF PASSED THE GAVEL TO MR LACKEY WELL THERE ARE. ASSEMBLY MEMBER VAL A B. L. A. FORTY SIX. THANK YOU MISTER AND MEMBERS AND COMMITTEE STAFF FOR YOUR TIME AND FOR WORKING WITH ME ON THIS BILL ARE START BY SAYING THAT WE'VE ACCEPTED THE COMMITTEE'S PROPOSED AMENDMENTS AB EIGHTEEN FORTY SIX IS AN IMPORTANT MEASURE THAT WILL REQUIRE THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE TO NOTIFY CRIME VICTIMS AND THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS IF THEY WILL NOT BE SENDING A REPRESENTATIVE REPRESENTATIVE TO ATTEND A PAROLE HEARING. IF A DISTRICT ATTORNEY DOES NOT SEND A REPRESENTATIVE AB EIGHTEEN FORTY SIX WOULD REQUIRE THE STATE TO REIMBURSE CRIME VICTIMS AND THEIR FAMILIES IF THEY NEED TO HIRE A PRIVATE ATTORNEY MEMBERS IT IS A TYPICAL PRACTICE FOR A DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE TO SEND REPRESENT REPRESENTATIVES TO APPEAR AT PAROLE HEARINGS AND DEMONSTRATE TO THE BOARD WHETHER AN INMATE IS UNSUITABLE FOR RELEASE. THE REPRESENTATIVE CAN HIGHLIGHT THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE INMATES CRIMES AND REBUT ANY MISLEADING ARGUMENTS MADE BY THE END MAY OR THE INMATE'S ATTORNEY ABOUT THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CRIME. THE RECENT POLICIES ENACTED IN ANGELES COUNTY. DISTRICT BY LOS ANGELES COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY GEORGE GASC GONE ARE ANYTHING BUT TYPICAL SOME OF THESE POLICIES HAVE CREATED HORRENDOUS CONSEQUENCES FOR CRIME VICTIMS AND THEIR FAMILIES. IN PARTICULAR HIS POLICY OF FORBIDDING DEPUTIES FROM ATTENDING PAROLE HEARINGS HAS LEFT MANY VICTIMS OUT IN THE DRIVE OUT TO DRY. CRIME VICTIMS SHOULD NOT HAVE TO FEND FOR THEMSELVES IN A COMPLEX LEGAL SYSTEM. WITHOUT THE LEGAL ASSISTANCE THEY NEED TO HAVE THEIR LOVED ONES OR THEMSELVES MEANINGFULLY REPRESENTED AND PAROLE HEARINGS MANY VICTIMS AND THEIR FAMILIES ARE UNABLE TO FULLY VOICE THEIR CONCERNS. AB EIGHTEEN FORTY SIX OFFERS THESE CRIME VICTIMS AND THEIR FAMILIES A NEEDED SOURCE OF SUPPORT PASSAGE OF THIS BILL WILL DO THE FOLLOWING. THE BILL WILL REQUIRE THAT THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE NOTIFY VICTIMS THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS AND THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS IF THEY WILL NOT BE SENDING A REPRESENTATIVE TO A PAROLE HEARING. ADDITIONALLY FOR VICTIMS THAT SEEK OUT PRIVATE LEGAL COUNSEL TO ASSIST WITH PARTICIPATING IN A PAROLE HEARING WHEN THE LOCAL DA WON'T. AB EIGHTEEN FORTY SIX WILL REQUIRE THE STATE TO REIMBURSE VICTIMS FOR REASONABLE PRIVATE ATTORNEY FEES OF UP TO NINE HUNDRED DOLLARS. THESE PROVISIONS ARE CRUCIAL PERFECT FOR PROVIDING CRIME VICTIMS AND THEIR FAMILIES THE SUPPORT THEY NEED DURING THESE PAROLE HEARINGS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS. AND I DO HAVE TWO WITNESSES ON THE LINE- RICHARD BOSS OF HAS A HE WAS THE HUSBAND OF A CRIME VICTIM AND TOKOPEDIA OF CRIME VICTIMS UNITED AT A BOARD MEMBER MOVE THE BILL. BEFORE THAT WITNESS GOES FORWARD THERE SEEMS TO BE A LITTLE BIT OF CONFUSION WE NEED TO CLARIFY ON THE AMENDMENTS. THERE'S NO NEW AMENDMENTS OF THE ONES THAT WERE IN PRINT IS THAT CORRECT CORRECT.

MISTER CHAIR THERE IS NO ONE ELSE TO SIGNAL THEY WISH TO SPEAK. THANK YOU VERY MUCH DO WE HAVE ANY WITNESSES OF AN OPPOSITION WOULD LIKE TO EXPRESS THEIR- OPPOSITION THIS TIME. RESTORED. YOU MAY PROCEED. GOOD MORNING CHAIR MEMBERS- MY NAME'S KEITH WIDELY- THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF ON COMMON LAW WHERE WE- ARE NONPROFIT THAT WORKS TO. MAKE A FAIR DISCRETIONARY PAROLE PROCESS THAT'S THE WORK WE DO- I HAVE- BEEN STUDYING THIS PROCESS FOR TWENTY YEARS- AND APPEARED IN HUNDREDS OF PAROLE HEARINGS ALSO TEACH CLASSES BERKELEY LAW. CALIFORNIA PRISONS AND DISCRETIONARY PAROLE SO I I'M VERY FAMILIAR WITH THIS PROCESS- AB EIGHTEEN FORTY SIX CONTINUES A TREND THAT DELIVERS NO JUSTICE AND PROVIDES NO RELIEF CRIME SURVIVORS. MORE THAN FORTY FIVE YEARS AGO CALIFORNIA SEVERELY LIMITED THE PAROLE BOARD'S ROLE BECAUSE IT'S DECISIONS WERE TOO OFTEN BASED ON BIASED. EMOTION AND GUT FEELINGS SINCE THEN WE'VE PASSED LAWS REQUIRING SPECIAL PAROLE HEARINGS FOR YOUTH AND ELDERLY AND FOR CRIMES CAUSED IN PART BY DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. TO COUNTER THAT WE'VE ALSO SEEN AN EXPANSION OF THE ROLE OF VICTIMS IN THE PROCESS. RESEARCH SHOWS THAT THE PRESENCE OF A VICTIM IN A PAROLE HEARING IS A STRONGER PREDICTOR OF THE HEARING'S OUTCOME THAN MOST OTHER FACTORS. YOUTH ELDERLY THE ORIGINAL CRIME THE LENGTH OF INCARCERATION OR THE AMOUNT OF PROGRAM THE PERSON'S DONE. THIS IS A PROBLEM FOR SEVERAL REASONS FIRST- SURVIVORS HAVE NO UNIQUE INFORMATION ABOUT OF PAROLE APPLICANTS CURRENT. RISK TO PUBLIC SAFETY. THE ROLE IN RECOUNTING THE IMPACT OF THE CRIME STIRS UP EMOTIONS OF PAROLE COMMISSIONERS AND THEIR DECISIONS ARE THEREFORE BASED ON BIAS EMOTION AND GUT FEELINGS. JUST AS THEY WERE FORTY FIVE YEARS AGO SECOND THE PROCESS RE TRAUMATIZE. COMMISSIONERS DISCUSSED IN EXCRUCIATING DETAIL THE WORST THING THAT EVER HAPPENED TO SURVIVORS WHILE PROVIDING NO OPPORTUNITY FOR HEALING. YET OF GROWING BODY OF RESEARCH SHOWING THAT A MAJORITY OF SURVIVORS OF VIOLENT CRIME CHOOSE RESTORATIVE JUSTICE WHEN GIVEN AN OPTION. WE JUST DON'T GIVE THEM AN OPTION- IF CALIFORNIA REALLY CARED ABOUT SERVING SURVIVORS WE WOULD INVEST IN THAT KIND OF HEALING PROCESS. AND NOT ADD TO THIS HARMFUL HEARING PROCESS. THIRD AND FINALLY THIS BILL ALLOCATES DISPROPORTIONATE RESOURCES I HAVE AN EXAMPLE RECENT EXAMPLE I JUST HAD A HEARING. WITH EIGHT SURVIVORS PRESENT IN THE HEARING WOULD QUALIFY FOR AN ATTORNEY. COSTLESS SEVENTY TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR ATTORNEYS JUST FOR THAT ONE HEARING AND THAT'S COMPARED TO JUST NINE HUNDRED DOLLARS- FOR THE WANT ATTORNEY THAT WOULD BE STATUTORILY REQUIRED TO REPRESENT A PAROLE APPLICANT THAT'S AN UNCONSCIONABLE THIS. THIS COMMITTEE SHOULD MAKE CLEAR THAT THE LEGISLATURE WILL NOT BLINDLY ENDORSE BILLS PROPOSED IN THE NAME OF BECOMES WITHOUT ASSESSING THE IMPACTS. COSTS IN ACTUAL CORRELATION TO PUBLIC SAFETY. WE STRONGLY URGE A NO VOTE ON THIS BILL. THANK YOU. MARCO GEORGE STRAIT HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION IN OPPOSITION TO EIGHTEEN FORTY SIX I WANT TO FIRST SAY THAT WE APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS BUT WE'RE SORRY BUT REGRETFULLY MUST STILL OPPOSE- AND I WOULD JUST ECHO OF THE COMMENTS THAT MR WILEY MADE. AND SAY- THAT BASICALLY. EIGHTEEN FORTY SIX. IN A VERDANT LEE SEEKS TO SUBVERT THE RULE OF LAW AND REPLACE THE FACTORY EVAN PAROLE PROCESS WITH AN EMOTIONALLY DRIVEN PROCESS. WHERE THE FAMILY TO EXERT UNDUE PRESSURE ON THE PAROLE COMMISSIONERS. WHO ARE PRIMARILY TASKED WITH ENSURING BOTH THE SAFETY OF THE COMMUNITY AND DUE PROCESS FOR THE INDIVIDUAL. AND ALSO I WANT TO SAY THAT PAYING FOR AND VICTIMS LAWYERS WOULD MERELY CREATE A BONANZA FOR POTENTIALLY UNSCRUPULOUS LAWYERS TO PREY UPON THE EMOTIONALLY VULNERABLE VICTIMS AND THEIR FAMILIES BY PROMISING THEM THAT THEY CAN GUARANTEE THAN AN INDIVIDUAL BE PAROLED. AND OF COURSE. THIS IS A PROMISE THAT NO ETHICAL LAWYER COULD MAKE SENSE THE BOARD'S DECISION IS SUPPOSED TO BE GOVERNED BY THE LAW ON THE FAX. ALL THE WHILE THE TAXPAYERS WILL BE STUCK WITH PAYING THE TAB. WASTING THAT COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER SPENT ON EDUCATION MENTAL HEALTH CARE AND HOUSING. THESE ARE PUBLIC GOODS THAT WOULD MAKE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY STAY FOR EVERYONE. SO WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR NO VOTE.

I APOLOGIZE YOUR YOU'RE YOUR LINE IS BARELY AUDIBLE WE COULD NOT HEAR YOU KNOW. MISTER CHAIR THERE IS NO ONE ELSE TO SIGNAL THAT THEY WISH TO SPEAK RIGHT THANK YOU I WOULD NOT BRING IT BACK TO. COMMITTEE MEMBERS. MISTER CORK. SAU MARSH MARSHES LAW WAS- AN INITIATIVE AND AS LONG AS WE HAVE THAT INITIATIVE PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT USED TO. MATTERS OF LAW AND LAW COURT HAVE SOMEONE TO GUIDE THEM THROUGH THE PROCESS IF THE DA. A KILLER FOR TELLY CAL OF THE QUARTER THIS. DOES WISH TO SEND SOMEONE A I THINK IT'S ONLY RIGHT THAT THEY HAVE. REPRESENTATION I THINK YOUR ARGUMENTS BY AND LARGE ARE ACTUALLY AGAINST. MARSY'S LAW IN WHICH CASE YOU REALLY SHOULD. THE ONLY WAY TO CHANGE THAT IS TO HAVE ANOTHER INITIATIVE. SO I'LL BE VOTING I. RESPOND TO. BUT I HAVE THE STRUGGLE WITH THIS ONE I THAT THAT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR VICTIMS ARE SUPPORTED THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS GET THE SUPPORT THAT THEY NEED. I DO HAVE CONCERNS WITH THE NOTICE. OR THE LACK OF NOTICING AND IMPACT THAT THAT WILL HAVE ON THE PEARLY. AND IN IN THEIR OPPORTUNITY TO BE ABLE TO SEEK PAROLE- AND I HAVE ADDRESSED THIS WITH YOUR- WITH YOUR STAFF- AND WITH YOU AUTHOR AT. HEATEDLY AND FOR THAT REASON I WILL BE VOTING NO ON THIS. THANK YOU WITH SUCH. SO I'M GONNA BE SUPPORTING YOUR- YOUR BILL TODAY- AS YOU KNOW A DE. I GOTTA TELL YOU THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE REAL WORLD AND THE EDUCATIONAL WORLD AND WHAT WE WISH WOULD HAPPEN. BUT I HAD A CHANCE- THIS YEAR TO WITNESS. I WHAT IF FEEL LIKE TWENTY THIRTY YEARS LATER. WHEN THE A PERSON- THAT- IS A NEIGHBOR OF MINE. WHO ARE SUFFERED A HORRIFIC. ASSAULT AFTER WATCHING HER DAD GET SHOT IN THE FACE SHE GOT SHOT IN THE CHEST SHE MANAGED TO SURVIVE. HER HER PERPETRATOR CAME UP FOR A PAROLE HEARING. AND THEY FOUND OUT ABOUT THE LAST MINUTE. AND THEY WERE CONVINCED THAT THEY WERE GOING TO LET THIS GUY GO AND BACK INTO SOCIETY. AND THE FEAR IN THAT COUPLE. THAT THEIR LIVES ARE GOING TO BE IN DANGER THEIR KIDS LIVES ARE GOING TO BE IN DANGER ISRAEL IT'S NOT IMAGINED IT'S EDIBLE LASTING EFFECT OF HAVING A HORRIFIC CRIME PERPETRATED ON SOMEBODY. AND SO THIS BILL HELPS THOSE PEOPLE. HAVE A VOICE BECAUSE THEY NEED TO HAVE A VOICE THIRTY YEARS LATER FORTY YEARS LATER. IT DOESN'T MATTER. WHAT HAPPENED IN THAT IT HAPPENED THIRTY YEARS LATER AND THIS PERSON HAS A MIRACULOUSLY CHANGED. I HOPE THEY CAN I HOPE THEY HAVE. I HOPE THEY'VE FOUND WHATEVER IT IS THAT MADE THEM THAT PERSON WAY BACK THEN TO MAKE THEM A BETTER PERSON BUT THAT DOES NOT ALLEVIATE THE FEAR. THAT THESE HAVE THESE. AND THEY HAVE TO HAVE A WAY TO VOICE THEIR FEARS EVEN IF IT MAKES THAT WHAT YOU THINK THE PAROLE HEARING WHAT MAKES IT A BIASED HEARING. THEY THEY NEED TO HAVE A PLACE IN THAT HEARING. IT'S NOT THEIR FAULT THAT THEY ARE THERE. IT'S THEIR FAULT THE MAYBE THEY SURVIVED AND CAN BE THERE. AND SO I'M GOING TO BE SUPPORTING THIS BECAUSE IT MAKES SENSE MAKES SENSE FOR VICTIMS. AND WHILE I'M ALL FOR PEOPLE BEING REHABILITATED. THERE IS A LASTING EFFECT ON SOME ACTIONS THAT PEOPLE TAKING THEIR LIVES. AND TO SIMPLY DISMISS THAT THE VICTIMS CONCERNS IN FAVOR OF THAT AT TO ME IS WRONG. YES MR LACKEY. YEAH FIRST OF ALL LET ME JUST A CORRECT ONE OF THE- INFERENCES- THERE WOULD BE MULTIPLE NINE HUNDRED DOLLAR REIMBURSEMENTS FOR MULTIPLE CHARGES- SO QUESTION TO THE AUTHORS OUT I. ON THAT IS ACTUALLY NOT ACCURATE THIS IS ACTUALLY SUPPOSED TO BE A LAST DITCH EFFORT TO- REIMBURSE. WHO HAVE PAID ALREADY PAID FOR PRIVATE ATTORNEY- AND THE ULTIMATE REASON IS BECAUSE THE DA IS NOT SENDING REPRESENTATION AT THE DA'S SEND REPRESENTING. THEN THIS WOULD NOT GOING TO AFFECT. AND THE WORD IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THE MAN NINE HUNDRED DOLLAR REIMBURSES WOULD ONLY. TAKE PLACE IF THERE'S MULTIPLE VICTIMS. AND NOT MULTIPLE CHARGES THAT CORRECT CORRECT. OKAY AND THE OTHER PIECE AS WE KEEP TALKING ABOUT. I'M I WAS A GAS WHEN I HEARD THAT- IT'S BELIEVE THAT- VICTIMS PRESENT IN FOR- JUST EMOTION TO THE JUDICIAL PROCESS. EMOTIONS ARE NOT ALWAYS MISLEADING- AND I THINK THAT WE HAVE SUCH A STRONG FOCUS ON REHABILITATING. THAT WE FORGET ABOUT THEIR TERMS AND I DON'T THINK. THE DALLAS A FAIR PROCESS I THINK THAT- VICTIMS DESERVE TO BE PRESIDENT THEY DESERVE TO BE CONSIDERED AND JUDGMENTS. AND- I'M I'M HOPING THAT WE CAN MOVE IN THE DIRECTION OF CONSIDERING INVOLVING VICTIMS IN THIS PROCESS WHICH THIS BILL DOES I'M PROUD TO SUPPORT IT GLAD YOU BROUGHT FORWARD. IN YOU. DID YOUR- YOU GOT THAT LOOK I JUST I WE NEED TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE VICTIMS SUPPORTED- I DO THINK THAT WE NEED TO ALSO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE. AT THE BALANCE OF POWER RECOGNIZED WITHIN THE PAROLE HEARING AND HAVING AN OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE PEOPLE HAVE THE CURRENT CORRECT NOTICING SO THAT THEY CAN PREPARE AND HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO FULLY ADDRESS. THAT EMOTIONAL MOMENT AND ADDRESS THOSE VICTIMS CONCERNS IN THAT MOMENT IN THE PRO HEARING IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL WHICH IS WHY A I IMPLORE THE AUTHOR TO CONSIDER. INC ADDING A NOTICING REQUIREMENTS INTO THIS INTO THE LEGISLATION. AND I THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT WERE WILLING TO HAVE DEEPER CONVERSATIONS ABOUT WITH WITH YOUR OFFICE. ANY OTHER COMMENT. OKAY YOU MAY CLOSE. THANK YOU I'M AB EIGHTEEN FORTY SIX NOTIFICATION AND REIMBURSEMENT PROVISIONS WILL SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE THE ABILITY OF CRIME VICTIMS AND THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PAROLE HEARING PROCESS WE'RE DOING THAT YOU KNOW AS WE SPEAK WE HAVE I'M WITNESSES IN SUPPORT WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION AND I GUARANTEE YOU THAT THAT YOU DON'T JUST WAKE UP IN THE MORNING YOU DECIDE YOU'RE GOING TO COME AND- WHICH YOU GIVE YOUR TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT OR OPPOSITION IT WAS ORGANIZED IT WAS ORGANIZED THAT BY PEOPLE WHO UNDERSTAND THE PROCESS. AND ARE VICTIMS DESERVE THE SAME PROCESS AND THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL HELPS TO ENSURE- AS YOU JUST HEARD WITNESSES IN SUPPORT CRIME VICTIMS AND THEIR FAMILIES ARE BEING NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY THE POLICIES OF LA'S DISTRICT ATTORNEY AND- IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT WE THE STATE STAND UP FOR CRIME VICTIMS AND ENSURE THAT THEIR VOICES ARE NOT HINDERED BY THE COMPLEX THE COMPLEXITY OF THE JDICIAL PROCEEDINGS WHEN A DA DOES NOT ENGAGE IN THE PROCESS I URGE YOUR SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE THANK YOU. THANK YOU- I I'M INVOLVED PROBABLY IN IN A MORE PAROLE HEARINGS THAT I DO NOT WANT TO MY OFFICE CASTIGATING LETTERS ONE OF I DID LEARN. IS ONCE IS PAROLED- WE DO NOT READ LITIGATE CRIME. IT'S ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THEY'VE BEEN REHABILITATED I THINK THIS IS WHERE MAYBE SOME OF THE CONFUSION IT IS NOT ABOUT. GOING AFTER SOMEONE FOR CRIME THAT THEY COMMITTED WELL GUESS WHAT. THEY PAID THEIR SAID DEBT TO SOCIETY. AND SO IT IS IT IS IMPAIR. THAT YOU UNDER WHEN YOU GO TO A HE- IS RELATED. IT IS NOW SAYING WE NEED TO PUNISH YOU MORE IS NOT SAYING THAT AT ITS- THE QUESTION IS WILL YOU CAN REHABILITATED. AND I THINK THAT'S WHERE AND I DON'T WANNA GET INTO DEBATE AWARE THAT DA SHOW UP WHOEVER SHOWS UP AT IT AT THE END OF THE DAY YOU WANT TO MAKE. THAT THAT ENDED. HAS BEEN FULL REHABILITATED AND WHETHER OR NOT THEY'RE DANGER TO SOCIETY AND COME OUT AGAIN- I WANT YOU FOR WORKING WITH OUR OFFICE. MORE FOR YOU WERE CUT OFFICE AHEAD OF TIME SO THAT'S WHY YOU DON'T HAVE TO TAKE AMENDMENTS BUT ALSO WOULD URGE YOU TO LISTEN TO IT ASSEMBLY MEMBER BONTA SAID. ABOUT MAYBE TAKING SOME MORE MEMBERS IF DISTINCT OR TO GET OUT AND MOVE FORWARD. BECAUSE I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE KEEP IT BALLOTS. THAT IS WAIT ONE TOGETHER AND YOU HAVE TO MAKE. OF THAT INDIVIDUAL AND WHAT THEY'VE DONE. WHILE THEY'RE IN PRISON. TO MAKE THEMSELVES BETTER. SO THAT WE THEY DO COME BEFORE. A PAROLE HEARING. NOT ONLY IS IT FAIR BUT WE UNDERSTAND THAT WHEN WE MEAN TO. CRAWL JUSTICE SYSTEM THE LEGAL SYSTEM WHEN WE LET THEM OUT. WE'RE PRETTY DARN CERTAIN. THAT THE COMMUNITY WILL BE SAFE BUT MOST IMPORTANT AT THE KERR TRY IN A DAY. THEY BELIEVE THAT. WHAT THEY DID WAS WRONG. THEY SERVED OUR TIME AND WE LET THEM OUT- AND SO- BECAUSE OF YOUR COOPERATION WITH US TO MEET AND HAVE AN AMENDMENTS. AND MY BELIEF THAT YOU WILL LISTEN TO WHAT. OF SOME OF THE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE IT SAID- AND I HAVE POKED FAITH THAT YOU WILL HELP TO IMPROVE THIS BILL. A CHESHIRE AND I'VE. YOUR ON AB FORTY EIGHT B. SIX BY A TERRACE THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE JONES SAWYER. GENSER IRAQI. BLACKIE HI BONTA. BONTA NEL BRIAN NO BRIAN NO CORK ARE WORK I STEP. SEYARTO THEATER I. THE MEASURES ON CALL YOU NEED ONE MORE VOTE. AND WE WILL. NOW GO TO. A. B. EIGHTEEN FORTY SEVEN CALAVERAS ITEM NUMBER THREE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN PERSON COMMITTEE STAFFER WORKING WITH ME ON THIS BILL I AB EIGHTEEN FORTY SEVEN WILL HELP CRIME VICTIMS THEIR NEXT OF KIN FAMILY MEMBERS AND OTHER MEANING FLEE EXERCISE THEIR RIGHTS DURING PAROLE AND WE SENTENCING HEARINGS. RECENT REGULATIONS FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS IMPOSE ON REASONABLY DIFFERENT STANDARDS AND NOTICE REQUIREMENTS ON CRIME VICTIMS AND THEIR LOVED ONES IN SOME CASES THE FAMILY MEMBERS OF CRIME VICTIM'S ARE THE ONLY ONES WHO ARE ABLE TO SPEAK ON BEHALF OF THEIR LOVED ONES WHO LOST THEIR LIVES AT THE HANDS OF CRIMINALS. SHOULD THESE FAMILY MEMBERS BE SUBJECTED TO DIFFERENT NOTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS THIS IS WHAT THIS BILLS ADDRESSING IN MY VIEW IT'S ENTIRELY UNREASONABLE TO MAINTAIN THESE DIFFERENT STANDARDS ADDITIONALLY RECENT LEGISLATION PROVIDED FOR THE COURT TO DISPENSE WITH HAVING AN IN COURT HEARING ON A PETITION FOR RESENTENCING IF THE PROSECUTION AND DEFENSE ATTORNEY AGREED. THIS UNFORTUNATELY NEGLECTS TO ACCOUNT FOR THE CONSTITUTION CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT OF CRIME VICTIMS TO BE HEARD DURING ANY PROCEEDING AND WHAT'S THE RIGHT OF A VICTIM IS IMPLICATED. THE STATE NEEDS TO OFFER CRIME VICTIMS CLEAR WAYS TO PARTICIPATE IN SITUATIONS WHERE THE PROSECUTION AND DEFENSE ATTORNEY AGREED TO DISPENSE WITH IN COURT HEARINGS. TO REMEDY THESE OVERSIGHTS AB EIGHTEEN FORTY SEVEN DOES THE FOLLOWING THE BILL PROHIBITS THE BOARD OF PAROLE HEARINGS FROM REQUIRING MORE THAN FIFTEEN DAYS MINIMUM NOTICE. THAT A VICTIM VICTIMS NEXT OF KIN A MEMBER OF THE VICTIM'S FAMILY OF VICTIMS REPRESENTATIVE COUNCIL REPRESENTING ANY OF THESE PERSONS OR VICTIMS SUPPORT PERSONS MUST GIVE THEIR INTENTION TO ATTEND A PAROLE SUITABILITY HEARING. THE BILL ALSO PROVIDES CRIME VICTIMS A MEANS OF HAVING THEIR OPINION HEARD ON A PETITION OF RESENTENCING EVEN IF THE DEFENSE AND THE PROSECUTION BOTH AGREE TO WAIVE THE HEARING. IF THEY NOTIFY THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY WITHIN FIFTEEN DAYS OF RECEIVING THE NOTICE THAT RESENTENCING IS BEING SOUGHT. THESE PROVISIONS ARE NECESSARY FOR HELPING CRIME VICTIMS MEANING FLEE PARTICIPATE AND PAROLE AND RESENTENCING HEARINGS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. I DO HAVE- ONE WITNESS I PREPARED TO TESTIFY TODAY WITH CRIME VICTIMS UNITED THE OPERATOR REPUBLICAN UP THE LINE FOR REPRESENTATION CRIME VICTIMS UNITED. GOOD AFTERNOON THIS IS TOP OF IT ALL IN AGAIN ONCE AGAIN TO THIS COMMITTEE THANK YOU ON BEHALF CRIME VICTIMS UNITED I AM AN EXECUTIVE BOARD MEMBER WHEN CRIME VICTIMS UNITED WAS FOUNDED IN NINETEEN SEVENTY NINE IT WAS DUE TO THE UNFORTUNATE NEED OF THE TWO INDIVIDUALS FOUND THIS ORGANIZATION LIKE IN HER IT'S LARGER. THERE DAUGHTER WAS MORE pVICTIMS OF CRIME VICTIMS UNITED STARTED. I STRUGGLE TO TEST ONE NINE. I SHOULD WITH THE ASK HOW DID GET HERE. READ CRIME VICTIMS UNITED WE'RE FIGHTING FOR THE VICTIMS OF CRIMES HAVE STANDARDS. YOU KNOW MAYBE NOT THE SAME STANDARDS OF THE PERSONS CONVICTED OF THE CRIME IN WHICH THEY WERE A VICTIM OF. BUT TO HAVE STANDARDS THAT CAN SOMETIMES BE PREVENTATIVE OF THE VICTIMS OF FAMILY AND WITH THE NEXT YOU CAN. TAP TO REPAIR PAROLE HEARINGS. AND HOW THEIR DAY ESSENTIALLY IN COURT AND I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU JUST SAID MOMENTS AGO ABOUT. YOU KNOW THE FACT THAT WE DON'T WANT TO READ. THE CASE- IN THE END THE TREATMENT- PREVENTION BILL BUT IN THIS INSTANCE THESE VICTIMS. ARE STILL VICTIMS AND THEY WILL NEVER NOT BE VICTIMS IT APPEARS THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS IS MAKING RULES. THAT ARE HURDLES AND HURDLES THAT CARRY A MUCH HIGHER BURDEN FOR THE VICTIMS TO APPEAR AT THIS POLL HEARINGS. WE. HAVE TO ASK OURSELVES WHY. I TOLD YOU I THIS COME WE HAVE TO START LOOKING UP FOR VICTIMS. AS MUCH AS THE BEING DONE FOR THOSE CHARGED AND IN THIS INSTANCE CONVICTED OF A CRIME. I DON'T WANT TO CALL CRIMINALS THEY'RE CONVICTED OF A CRIME. AND ONE MORE THING THIS BILL DOES WHY WOULD WE PREVENT AN ATTORNEY ON BEHALF OF THE VICTIM. APPEARING IN PERSON WE ALL KNOW BEING IN PERSON IS A LOT MORE IMPACTFUL THAN IT REMOTELY SO ON BEHALF OF CRIME VICTIMS UNITED WE ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT AND A YES VOTE ON AB. EIGHTEEN FORTY SEVEN. THANK YOU. ANY WITNESSES IN HERE IN THE AUDITORIUM FOUR IN SUPPORT. ANY WITNESSES ON ON CALL THEY WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT. OF THE BILL. AB. EIGHTEEN FORTY SEVEN.

OVER THE PAST YEAR THE NATIONAL RETAIL SECURITY SURVEY REPORTED STATED THAT ABOUT 69% OF RETAILERS SAID THEY HAD SEEN AN INCREASE IN ORGANIZED RETAIL CRIME. THE REPORT ALSO NOTES THAT RETAILERS SAY THE STAFF HAVE BECOME MORE AGGRESSIVE AND VIOLENT IN YEARS PAST ADDITIONALLY CALIFORNIA PROSECUTORS STATE THAT THE NUMBER OF DEATHS ARE LIKELY UNDER REPORTED AS BUSINESS OWNERS ARE DISCOURAGED FROM FILING REPORTS SINCE THE PENALTY AGAINST CRIMINALS HAS BEEN REDUCED TO A MISDEMEANOR.

PUBLIC SAFETY ADVISER FOR CALIFORNIA FOR SAFETY AND JUSTICE SMILE THIRD COMMITTEE MEETING ABOUT PROP FORTY SEVEN AND THANK YOU FOR THE PRIVILEGE OF BEING ABLE TO TALK. FIRST OFF OF PROP FORTY SEVEN DID NOT CHANGE THE THRESHOLD FOR- MISDEMEANOR FELONY TO FROM FOUR HUNDRED AND NINE FIFTY THAT OCCURRED FIRST IN TWO THOUSAND AND TEN. PROP FORTY SEVEN DID- CHANGE THE WATER SECTIONS OF IT BUT IT DIDN'T- MOVE THE THRESHOLD AT NINE FIFTY. THE PERHAPS EVEN MORE IMPORTANTLY. AT NINE FIFTY THERE ARE THIRTY NINE STATES IN THE UNION TO HAVE A HIGHER THRESHOLD FOR THE A OF DIVISION BETWEEN MISDEMEANOR FELONY- OF VIOLENCE. IF WE RETURN TO FOUR HUNDRED OTHER WOULD BE ONE STATE NEW JERSEY WHO HAS A LOWER THRESHOLD THEY CURRENTLY HAVE A THRESHOLD OF TWO HUNDRED. TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS SUPPORT UNDERSTAND TOO THAT THE PEW FOUNDATION DID A LOT OF VERY FLORAL FALL- INDEPENDENT. AUDIT OF THE IMPLICATIONS OF CHANGING THE THRESHOLD UP TO SEND SOME INSTANCES LIKE TEXAS. TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS- IT HAD NO IMPACT ON EITHER REPORT CRIME OR INCIDENTS AT ALL IT'S- A BASICALLY A NEUTRAL- FOR PRIME PREVENTION POINT OF VIEW IT IS- AS IS TO OBVIOUSLY CECILIA DESIGNED TO BE. A WAY TO CASE MANAGE FRAUD DISTRICT ATTORNEYS COURTS AND PRISON POPULATIONS. AND OF COURSE OUR PRISON POPULATION IS STILL UNDER THE GUIDELINES OF THE FEDERAL COURTS. THE THE THREES ARE- IS I'VE HAD TO DO IT OR BEEN ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN ALL HAVE A SO CENTRAL WHEN IT COMES TO FORTY SEVEN AND NOT TO BE FLIPPANT ABOUT IT BUT IF WE COULD JUST GET BACK TO WHERE WE CAN PUT PEOPLE IN STATE PRISON FOR THEFT WILL BE RELEASED A WHOLE LOT BETTER OFF. AND AGAIN I REMIND FOLKS FOR DECADES THE CLEARANCE RATE OR WHICH IS JUST A REST- DIFFICULT ARREST NOT CONVICTION FOR ALL CRIMES GO CONNECTED TO PROP FORTY SEVEN WASHINGTON FEB RUN SOMETHING LESS THAN 5% 50% OR EVEN REPORTED 5% OR IDENTIFIED CAPTURED. YOU COULD DIVIDE THAT BY ANOTHER THIRD FOR CONVICTION SO YOU'RE RUNNING SOMEWHERE AROUND 3% WHEN YOU LOOK AT BOB OF SERVICE RATES THE PRIME OR THE HIGHEST RECIDIVISM RECIDIVISM RATES IN OUR POPULATIONS JAIL AND PRISON. FIRST AND SECOND DRUMMERS EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY FOUR. MARCADA CONCLUDED DRUG OFFENSE PROP CRIMES IN THEFTS THEY RUN ABOUT SO FIVE. I'VE SAY BECAUSE THE VERY TARGET POP THE FORTY SEVEN FUN SIX HUNDRED MILLION TO DATE A HUNDRED THIRTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET. THE TARGETS THAT VERY GROUP. THAT GROUP WHEN THEY ARE PROGRAMS AND I HAVE VERY DIFFERENT FEELINGS AND SOME MEMBERS RESPECTFULLY OF THE COMMITTEE AROUND THE IMPLICATIONS OF- A- RAW VOTE TREATMENT AND REHABILITATION WHEN THAT GROUP IS TREATED THEY WERE SORT OF IT AT A MUCH LOWER RATE. THIS IS BEEN CONFIRMED BY OUR OWN BORDER STATE AND COMMUNITY CORRECTIONS. AND ALL AND FINE. THE PROP FORTY SEVEN HAS UNIQUELY PUMPED.

THAT WILL BRING YOU BACK TO THE COMMITTEE. OF FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. MR LUCKY AT HAND ON A BUTTON SO. YEAH I'M I'LL BE BRIEF COLIN WAS PRETTY EXTENDED THEIR SO HIM AND TRY TO GET TO THE POINT HERE- RETAIL THEFT IS A REAL PROBLEM LADIES AND GENTLEMAN AND- THIS IS OUR THIRD. PROPOSAL TO TRY TO BRING SOME REMEDY. WHAT WHEN THE GOVERNOR RECOGNIZES THE RETAIL THEFT IS A PIVOTAL PROBLEM AND HIS PROPOSED A SUBSTANTIAL FUNDS TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM. WE NEED TO FIGURE SOMETHING OUT. AND- I'M HOPING. THAT THIS MEASURE IMMINENT WON'T BE THE END ALL BE ALL BUT IT'LL BE A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION AND HAS MY SUPPORT. THANK YOU. I'LL MAKE A MOTION APPROVED. IS THERE A SECOND SHOT. ANY OTHER COMMENTS MISTER CHAIR IF I COULD JUST ADDRESS SOME OF THE POINTS THAT WERE BROUGHT UP- I KNOW THE PEW INSTITUTE- REPORT WAS BROUGHT UP EARLIER BUT I WOULD SAY THAT EVEN THE BERKELEY REPORT THAT WAS BROUGHT UP IN YOU KNOW CITY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF BERKELEY IS NOT KNOWN AS- ONE OF THE MOST CONSERVATIVE- REPORT SO WE CAN GET IN THE STATE BUT EVEN THEY RECOGNIZE THAT THERE WAS AN ISSUE. HERE THEY EVEN REPORTED EVEN FROM THEIR RESPONDENTS SIXTY FIVE PERCENT- SIGN INCREASING RETAIL THEFT RIGHT WELCOME A LIMITED- REMEDY TO THIS ISSUE WHEN YOU LOOK AT YOU KNOW THE GOVERNOR DOING SOMETHING LIKE MR LACKEY SAID ARE YOU LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED TO THE RITE AID WORKER DOWN IN LOS ANGELES THAT WAS SHOT AND KILLED BECAUSE THEY WERE TRYING TO PREVENT SOMEBODY FROM STEALING WHEN YOU. AT SAN FRANCISCO THERE WAS A WOMAN THAT HAD OVER A HUNDRED AND TWENTY SEPARATE INCIDENCES OF. CRYING BECAUSE SHE WAS TAKING THINGS FROM A TARGET THAT ABOUT THE VALUE WENT OVER FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. WHEN YOU LOOK AT. ANY WHEN YOU LOOK AT JUST WHAT'S HAPPENING ACROSS THE ENTIRE STATE AND WHEN YOU START ASKING PEOPLE. YOU KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON IN YOUR STORE WHAT'S HAPPENING AND THEY SAY LOOK- JUST LIKE WE HAD- THE TESTIMONY EARLIER IT'S PEOPLE ARE COMING IN AND JUST DEALING BECAUSE THEY KNOW THERE'S NO REAL REPUTATION. RIGHT THAT'S WHY YOU SEE THE THINGS HAPPENING AT. AT TARGET THAT'S WHY YOU SEE THESE THINGS AND WHY YOU HAD ALL OF THESE CALLS. COMING IN FROM ALL PARTS OF THE STATE EVERY REGION OF THE STATE THIS IS A PROBLEM. WE'RE TRYING TO DO WITH AB SIXTY NO THREE IS JUST HAVE A VERY. TARGETED APPROACH A VERY MEASURED APPROACH TO SAY LOOK WE NOT ONLY RECOGNISE THIS PROBLEM. BUT WE WANT TO HELP ADDRESS IT WHEN I'M TALKING TO LAW ENFORCEMENT LOCALLY WHEN I'M TALKING TO THE BUSINESS UNDER. WHEN I'M TALKING TO CUSTOMERS. THEY SAY LOOK. IN THE THRESHOLD WAS LOWER AT FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS WE DIDN'T SEE THE PROBLEMS THAT WE SEE NOW. NOW I KNOW THAT THERE'S- DEBATE ON. WHETHER THIS WILL ACTUALLY MAKE A DIFFERENCE AND WHETHER OTHER STATES HAVE HIGHER LIMITS IT'S FINE BUT HERE IN CALIFORNIA IF YOU JUST TALK TO THE LOCALS. IF YOU JUST TALK TO OUR BUSINESS OWNERS THEY WILL TELL YOU. SINCE THIS CHANGE THIS IS WHAT WE'VE SEEN IF WE COULD GO BACK AND SAY LOOK. LET'S GO BACK TO WHAT IT WAS PRIOR AND HOPEFULLY THAT HELPS ALLEVIATE THE SITUATION AT THE END OF THE DAY I WANT TO JUST MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE PROTECTING CONSUMERS. THAT WE'RE PROTECTING OUR STORE CLERKS SO THAT WHAT HAPPENED DOWN IN RITE AID DOESN'T HAPPEN TO OTHERS- WINDY YOU LOOK AT THE AMOUNT OF AGGRAVATED ASSAULTS THAT ARE HAPPENING TO OUR EMPLOYEES. AT OUR STORES WE WANT TO TRY TO HELP ALLEVIATE THAT I BELIEVE THIS IS A STEP IN THE RIGHT. RIGHT DIRECTION I JUST RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU AND- IT IS A PROBLEM IN THE GOVERNOR DID RECOGNIZE IT I WISH YOU HAD BEEN OPPORTUNITY TO LISTEN TO THE- PUBLIC SAFETY HERE WHEN WE TALKED ABOUT THE- THE GOVERNOR'S. BASIC QUARTER BILLION DOLLARS INVESTMENT IN ORGANIZED RETAIL THEFT- WHICH OBVIOUSLY I WAS VERY EXCITED ABOUT BECAUSE IT IS BY BILL. ORGANIZED RETAIL FOR THAT THEN I'M THE ONE THAT EXTENDED THE LEAD TO SUNSET. AND ALSO TOOK OUT SOME PROVISIONS I THOUGHT WAS HARMFUL- I THINK NOW HOPEFULLY WE GET IN OUR OFFER YOU THE SAME IF THIS BILL DOES NOT MAKE IT OUT HERE. THAT WE ALL COME TOGETHER IN A COLLABORATIVE POLICING STRATEGY- RIGHT NOW IS COMPROMISED AS WITH ME BASED POLLUTION IF AND WE'RE REALLY NOT GETTING TO- A COMPREHENSIVE PROPER CONSERVE SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM. WE'RE ALL GOING TO SIDE ARGUED ABOUT WHICH ONE IS BETTER. AND SO I WILL GIVE YOU TO DO THE SAME OPPORTUNITY THE GOVERNOR HAS GIVEN US RESOURCES IMPROBABLE GIVE US MORE. EVEN WHEN SOMEONE MENTIONED THAT YOU KNOW WE NEED BATMAN OR WHILE WE WAIT FOR BATMAN TO COME IN ABOUT BATMAN IS THE ATTORNEY GENERAL THAT IS THE IS THE CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY PATROL WE DO HAVE A BATMAN. WHEN OTHERS DO NOT DO THEIR JOB AND EXACERBATE THE SITUATION BECAUSE THEY DON'T LIKE THE LAWS THAT ARE IN PLACE BECAUSE THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO LAW ENFORCEMENT. WHERE LAWMAKERS WE MADE THE LAW THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO ENFORCE IT IS NOT BEING. ENFORCED IN A WAY THAT WILL REDUCE CRIME AND WE'RE NOT DOING WHAT WE NEED TO DO UNDER REHABILITATION SIDE TO ENSURE THAT WHEN. WHEN LAW ENFORCEMENT CAPTURE THESE INDIVIDUALS THEY'RE ABLE TO FUNNEL THEM INTO RICE RESOURCES SO THEY DON'T PERCENT OF A- SO IT IS A COMPREHENSIVE. OF COLLABORATIVE WHEN I SEE COLLABORATIVE IS NOT COMP IT'S NOT IT'S A PARTNERSHIP MR. IT'S A COLLABORATIVE PARTNERSHIP WITH POLICE AND COMMUNITY NOT. TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT YOU WILL TAKE WHAT THE OTHER SIDE WOULD TAKE AND SO ON. IF THIS BILL DOESN'T GET OUT WE STILL NEED TO HAVE FOR A DISCUSSION. ON HOW WE CAN ACTUALLY FOCUS LIKE A LASER ON HOW WE CAN IN ORGANIZED RETAIL THEFT. UP OTHERWISE AS I SAID BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE AND OTHER COMMITTEES ON THE OTHER PEOPLE THAT WILL GET TO THE ADVANTAGE OF THE CRIMINALS. THAT'S WHAT WE ARE DOING WE'RE ALLOWING THEM TO CRIMINALS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF OUR DYSFUNCTION. AND WE NEED TO STOP THIS DESTRUCTION. WORK TOGETHER. AND WITH THAT FOR THE REASONS IT WOULD STATED ABOUT- YOU REALLY HAVE TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT WILL GO AFTER TO FILL THE PRISONS. THAT IS NOT A SOLUTION THAT IS WHAT LOWERING THE THRESHER WILL ULTIMATELY DO IS JUST FILLED THE PRISONS AGAIN WE'VE ALREADY BEEN TO THREE STRAIGHT VERY DONE IT BEFORE. AND IT DIDN'T WORK TO BE A GAY PEOPLE OF WHO ARE FEARFUL OF CRIME GAVE HIM A WARM FEELING THAT THESE PEOPLE WERE INCARCERATED IN A PRISON PLANTATION SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE. BUT IT. GIVE A BLACK BROWN COMMUNITIES LIKE YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE. AND SO WITH THAT UNFORTUNATELY I'M A RECOMMENDED NO VOTE BUT I DO WANT TO KEEP THE DOOR OPEN. DEBT WE COME UP WITH A COLLABORATIVE COMPREHENSIVE POLICING STRATEGY MISTER CHAIR AND I APPRECIATE THAT AND- APPRECIATE YOU HERE IN THE BUILDING OKAY. I'M AB SIXTEEN AT THREE BY SOME MEMBERS SALAS THE MOTION IS DUE PASSED TO THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE JONES SAWYER. JONES SAWYER NO LACKEY LACKEY I BONTA. VOTING BONTA NOT VOTING BRIAN NOW BRIAN NO QUIRK. QUIRK KNOWS SANTIAGO. SANTIAGO NOT VOTING SEYARTO ZERO TWO I. THE MEASURE FAILS. THANK YOU. NOW WE HAVE. MISTER GIBSON BURST IN FILE ORDER. THEY'RE ACTING IN MAIENSCHEIN BUT IF CHEN DOESN'T SHOW MAIENSCHEIN IS NEXT YES. P. ITEM NUMBER FOUR GIPSON- AB NINETEEN TWENTY FOUR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO PRESENT ASSEMBLY BILL NINETEEN TWENTY FOUR WHICH SEEKS TO REDUCE BARRIERS TO EMPLOYMENT BUT THOSE WHO WERE ON I WANT TO UNDERSCORE WORK ON PROBATION ALTHOUGH THEY WERE CONVICTED OF A LESS SERIOUS CRIME. THIS IS A GROUP OF PEOPLE THOSE WHO SERVED PRISON SENTENCING. I'VE COME ACROSS MANY INDIVIDUALS IN MY DISTRICT MADE A MISTAKE MEMBERS THEY PAID THEIR DEBT TO SOCIETY. AND SINCE THEN THEY HAVE HAD TO FACE. OBSTACLES ROAD BLOCKS JUST TO GET BACK ON THEIR FEET. THE NAVIC AND NAVIGATING THEN THE TO THE NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES OF THESE BARRIERS. YES FELT BEYOND THE INDIVIDUAL AFFECT THESE ARE FOLKS WHO ARE NOT. STRUGGLING WHO ARE NOW STRUGGLING. TO MAKE ENDS MEET FOR THEIR FAMILIES. DO YOU KNOW WHAT IT FEELS LIKE. BEING ABLE NOT TO TAKE CARE OF YOUR FAMILY. BEING LESS THAN A MAN A WOMAN. BUILDING JUST LAST DAM. HAVING HAVING TO CHOOSE BETWEEN FEEDING YOURSELF OR FEEDING YOUR BABY. THIS IS THE REALITY THAT MANY OF MY DISTRICT AND THOSE ACROSS CALIFORNIA FACE EACH AND EVERY DAY. OURS AND OUR SOCIETY HAS REFUSED TO FORGIVE THEM. HAVING MADE A MISTAKE. AND JUST NEED SOMEBODY TO FORGIVE THEM JUST SO THAT THEY CAN WRITE A NEW NARRATIVE FOR THE LIVES MOVING FORWARD. WHEN SOMEONE IS DENIED A SECOND CHANCE TO PROVIDE FOR HIS OR HER FAMILY. THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY THERE'S A SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC IMPACT A CRIMINAL RECORD SHOULD NOT BE A LIFE SENTENCE FOR UNEMPLOYMENT. AND POVERTY. THIS MEASURE NOT ONLY BRINGS US A STEP CLOSER TO GIVING THOSE WHO HAVE PAID THEIR DEBT TO SOCIETY A FAIR SHOT TO REBUILD THEIR LIVES. BUT IT IS ALSO A TESTAMENT. TO WHAT WE BELIEVE REHABILITATION SHOULD BE AND LOOK LIKE IN THIS STATE. THIS BILL WOULD STREAMLINED APPLICATION PROCESS TOWARDS OBTAINING A CERTIFICATE OF REHABILITATION. HEY CERTIFICATE OF REHABILITATION ALLOWS THE COURT TO FIND A PERSON THAT HAS BEEN REHABILITATED. CURRENTLY IT IS HARD FOR THOSE CONVICTED OF A LESSER OF SERIOUS OFFENSE TO OBTAIN A CERTIFICATE THEN THOSE WHO ACTUALLY SERVED PRISON IN THIS STATE. I SCRATCH MY HEAD BECAUSE THIS DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO ME. LET ME BE CLEAR CERTIFICATE OF REHABILITATION DOES NOT STEAL. OR X. BONDS A CONVICTION. RECORD OR RESTORE CIVIL RIGHTS BUT IT CAN IMPROVE A PERSON'S CHANCE OF BEING GRANTED AN OCCUPATIONAL LICENSE BACK TO WORK. PUTTING PEOPLE BACK TO WORK WE'RE TALKING ABOUT FOLKS WHO HAVE PAID THEIR DEBT TO SOCIETY AND NEED TO FIND A JOB TO KEEP A ROOF OVER THEIR HEADS. BOOT ON THE TABLE. AND SUPPORT THEIR FAMILIES. PEOPLE EXCLUDED FROM EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES ARE MORE LIKELY TO FALL INTO A CYCLE OF CRIME. WE CAN CHANGE THIS. WE CAN STOP THE CYCLE WE CAN DO IT TODAY. MEMBERS OUR FOCUS SHOULD BE TOWARDS SUPPORTING THE REHABILITATION PROCESS AND ENCOURAGING PEOPLE TO GET BACK INTO THE WORK FORCE AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE IT IS OUR JOB TO HELP THOSE PEOPLE MOVE FORWARD AND WRITE A NEW NARRATIVE. IT IS TIME TO PUT JUSTICE REHABILITATION AND REDEMPTION. AT THE CENTER OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE. SYSTEM IN THIS STATE. AB NINETEEN TWENTY FOUR IS A COMMON SENSE MEASURE THAT WILL SERVE AS A TOOL TO PROVIDE A BETTER OPPORTUNITY. FOR PEOPLE LIVING WITH ALL RECORDS AND READY TO GET BACK TO WORK. AND GET THE PEACE OF AMERICAN DREAM JOINING ME TO PROVIDE SUPPORTING TESTIMONIES WHICH TO GILBERT AND MRS KIRBY FROM THE CALIFORNIA SAFETY AND JUSTICE. JOHN. YOU MAYBE GET. CALLING BY PHONE.

GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS WHEN ACTIVATING AND I AM THE PRESIDENT AND FOUNDER OF COMMUNITY REFLECTIONS AND LOCATED IN SOUTH LOS ANGELES. COMMUNITY REFLECTIONS WORKS TO ADDRESS THE IMMEDIATE NEEDS OF FAMILIES AND INDIVIDUALS AND UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES OF WESTMONT AND WESPAC. I'LL BE SPEAKING ABOUT THE DIFFICULTY OF OBTAINING MY CERTIFICATE OF REHABILITATION AND WHILE I WHOLEHEARTEDLY SUPPORT LEGISLATION THAT WILL MAKE IT MORE ACCESSIBLE FOR PEOPLE TO RECEIVE A CERTIFICATE OF REHABILITATION. FIRST OFF I'M SIXTY FIVE YEARS OLD AND I'VE BEEN IN THE SYSTEM SINCE A TEENAGER I GREW UP IN DEEP POVERTY AND A VERY DEPRESSING TIMES WHERE LOW PERFORMING SCHOOLS DRUGS. THE INDUSTRIALIZED NATION AND POLICE VIOLENCE PUTS MANY OF MY PEERS AND ME INTO CRIMINAL ACTIVITY I STILL HAD TO TAKE FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR MY ACTIONS AND HOLD MYSELF ACCOUNTABLE. YET IT WAS VERY CHALLENGING TO BECOME A PRODUCTIVE CITIZEN DUE TO THE CONVICTIONS AND MANY RESTRICTIONS PLACED ON ME BY THE SYSTEM. WHEN I LEARNED ABOUT OPPORTUNITIES TO MOVE FOR WITH MY LIFE AND WITH GOES OUT HALF THE MANY YEARS SUCH AS BEING A PUBLIC SERVANT AND A SUCCESSFUL ENTREPRENEUR I WOULD HIGHLY EXCITED AND DETERMINED AT THE SAME TIME. ONE OF THOSE OPPORTUNITIES TOWARDS FREEDOM WAS. A CERTIFICATE OF REHABILITATION. WELL IT TOOK ME TO YEARS TO RECEIVE MONSTER TO REHABILITATE. I STAYED THE COURSE AND LEARN HOW TO FILE MY PAPERWORK DO A LOT OF TRIAL AND ERROR. PEOPLE WHO COME TO MY COMMUNITY INTAKE CENTER SEEKING HELP WITH CERTIFICATES OF REHABILITATION AND OTHER LEGAL ASSISTANCE HAVE MENTIONED THAT THE LOWER YOUR FEES CAN BE HIGHLY EXPENSIVE. I HAD TO DRIVE BACK AND FORTH TO THE COURTS BECAUSE I HAD SO MANY CONVICTIONS. IN WITH GAS PRICES BEING SO RIDICULOUSLY HIGH I IMAGINE THIS WILL CREATE HUGE BARGAINS ALL UNEMPLOYED PEOPLE OR THOSE IN NEED OF FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE. WHEN I TOLD MY STORY TO THE DEPARTMENT OF REHABILITATION STAFF ABOUT WHY I FEEL I DESERVE TO BE REHABILITATED. I CRIED BECAUSE OF A LOT OF THE A LOT OF THE TRAUMA RESTART THIS AND BROUGHT UP- EMOTIONS IT WAS A LOT OF PRESSURE TO GET ALL OF THE FORMS FILLED OUT CORRECTLY. AND WHEN HE CAME TO MY DATE TO GO BEFORE THE JUDGE I WAS PANICKING ANXIOUS AND TRIGGER BECAUSE THE MY PTSD FROM PRESIDENT AND JUST GROWING UP IN SOUTH CENTRAL ROLE. THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS I HAD TO DO A LOT OF LEG WORK TO GET SUPPORT AND CHARACTER REFERENCE LETTERS FROM INDIVIDUALS AND ORGANIZATIONS THAT I WORK WITH SINCE MY CORPORATION. I BEGAN THE PROCESS AND EARLY TWENTY NINETEEN AND FINALLY RECEIVED MY CERTIFICATE OF REHABILITATION. IN MAY OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND- ROSS THIS IS A VERY STRESSED IN. YEAH AFTER LIKE A HUGE WEIGHT HAS BEEN LIFTED OFF OF MY BACK. I WORK WITH A LOT OF FORMERLY INCARCERATED PEOPLE IN MY COMMUNITY AND FOR THEM TO SEE THAT I CANRECEIVE MY CERTIFICATE OF REHABILITATION.

THE MEASURE PASSES THANK YOU VERY MUCH COMMITTEE. MR MAIENSCHEIN. YOU CAN GO NOW OCTOBER SITTING TO WAIT YOU'RE HERE WE'RE GOING DO YOU FOR THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISS MY BUDGET GETS MESSED UP IT'S ON YOU. BOB HAULAGE EISEN IN. I THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS I WANT TO BEGIN BY ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS AS PROPOSED IN THE ANALYSIS THE CALIFORNIA PENAL CODE TRAITS ALMOST ALL RESTRAINING ORDER VIOLATIONS AS MISDEMEANORS ALARMINGLY VIOLATIONS INVOLVING UNLAWFUL ENTRY INTO THE VICTIM'S HOME CARRY THE SAME PENALTIES AS VIOLATIONS OCCURRING VIA TAX TO SOCIAL MEDIA AND PHONE AND UNLAWFUL ENTRY INTO THE VICTIM'S HOME IS INTRUSIVE AND DANGEROUS PARTICULARLY IN CASES OF INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE. AB TWENTY FORTY WILL ALIGN THE PENALTY FOR FORCIBLY ENTERING INTO THE VICTIM'S HOME TO THAT OF VIOLATIONS THAT RESULT IN INJURY OF THE PROTECTED PARTY. THIS BILL WILL PUNISH PROTECTIVE ORDER VIOLATIONS WITH EITHER A TWO THOUSAND DOLLAR FINE. FOR THIRTY DAYS IMPRISONMENT IN A COUNTY JAIL. THIS BILL WILL GIVE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE VICTIMS A SENSE OF SECURITY IN KNOWING THAT THEIR HOUSEHOLD AND FAMILY ARE FURTHER PROTECTED FROM THEIR ABUSER. WITH ME ON THE LINE I HAVE REBEKAH ZIP ON BEHALF OF THE SAN DIEGO CITY ATTORNEY'S OFFICE. WHEN EVERY YEAR THANK YOU. GO AHEAD THANK ALL RIGHT THANK YOU THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS I REBEKAH THAT THE CHIEF OF THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND SEX CRIMES UNIT IN THE SAN DIEGO CITY ATTORNEY'S OFFICE APPEARING VIA TELEPHONE ON BEHALF OF SAN DIEGO CITY ATTORNEY MARA ELLIOTT. I WORK WITH VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE WHO HAVE OBTAINED PROTECTIVE ORDERS AGAINST THEIR ABUSERS A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE VICTIM MAY RETURN HOME ONLY TO DISCOVER THAT HER ABUSER HAS BEEN IN THE HOUSE THAT HE HAD PERHAPS RANSACKED IT OR WORSE IS STILL THERE IN HER HOME VIOLATING HER SENSE OF SAFETY AND WHAT SHOULD BE A SANCTUARY OFTEN IN VIOLATION OF A VALID SERVED PROTECTIVE ORDER FROM A FAMILY COURT. THIS INVASION OF PERSONAL SAFETY AND PRIVACY CREATES A SPECIAL TYPE OF TERROR ABOUT THEIR VICTIMS THAT ALLOW THEM TO TRACK THE VICTIM INCLUDING THE VICTIM'S SCHEDULE AND INFORMATION ABOUT THE VICTIMS FIFTY PLAN. I PERSONALLY SEEN DOZENS OF CASES WHERE AN ABUSER ENTERED THE VICTIM'S HOME AND FLAGRANT DISREGARD. OF A PROTECTIVE ORDER. ONE VICTIM HOME ALONE WITH HER THREE SMALL CHILDREN COWERED IN A BEDROOM WHILE HER ABUSER BROKE THROUGH HER FRONT DOOR WITH A CROWBAR. ANOTHER PERSON CAME HOME TO FIND THEIR ABUSER BURNING HER PERSONAL PROPERTY ON THE STOVE. AB TWENTY FORTY AS A MANDATORY MODERATE CUSTODIAL SANCTIONS THAT WILL DETER ABUSERS. ALLOW VICTIMS TIME TO REGROUP CHANGE LOCKS POR MOVED TO PROTECT THEM FROM DANGER. CURRENT LAW DOES NOT OFFER VICTIMS SUFFICIENT PROTECTION FROM THIS TYPE OF VIOLATION. AB TWENTY FORTY WILL ALSO AID JUDGES BY FLAGGING ELEVATED PROTECTIVE ORDER VIOLATION SO THAT THE INFORMATION CAN BE CONSIDERED AND BAIL AND SENTENCING DECISIONS. AND I'M AVAILABLE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE THANK YOU FOR THE TIME.

CURRENTLY CALIFORNIA'S CONCEAL CARRY WEAPONS CCW PERMITS ARE VALID FOR TWO YEARS OR UP TO FOUR YEARS DEPENDING ON THE OCCUPATION OF THE APPLICANT. AFTER WHICH IT MAY BE RENEWED. AB TWO ZERO THREE THREE WHAT EXTEND THE POSSIBLE POSSIBLE POSSESSION AND USE OF A CCW PERMIT FROM TWO YEARS UP TO FIVE YEARS. CURRENT LAWS BURDENSOME FOR CCW HOLDERS WHO COME IN FOR A RENEWAL EVERY TWO YEARS KNOWING FULL WELL THAT THE PERMIT WILL BE RENEWED. IN ADDITION TO SAVING RENEWAL COST FOR CCW HOLDERS.

BE SUBJECT TO THE SCRUTINY AND PROCESS REGULARLY THIS BILL FALLS SHORT OF THIS THERE'S SIMPLY TOO MUCH THAT CAN CHANGE IN AN INDIVIDUAL'S LIFE OVER THE COURSE OF FIVE YEARS AS THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS POINTS OUT A PERSON'S MENTAL HEALTH OR LIFE CIRCUMSTANCES MAY HAVE CHANGED IN A WAY AS TO NOW MAKE THE PERSON AT REST OR NO LONGER HAVING GOOD COSTS SIMILAR SIMILAR HE HAD THE RIGHT TO CARRY CONCEALED FIREARMS SHOULD ONLY COME WITH AN OBLIGATION TO BE WELL TRAINED IN FIREARMS AND FIREARM SAFETY REQUIRING TRAINING ONLY EVERY FIVE YEARS IS INSUFFICIENT AND WOULD PLACE CALIFORNIANS AT RISK. IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT CALIFORNIA CONTINUE TO BE A LEADER AND MAINTAIN STRONG STANDARDS IN THE FACE OF THE MOVEMENT TO PERMIT LESS CARRY AND OTHER STATES STATES WITH HIGHER WEEK CONCEALED CARRY PERMITTING LAWS- ASSOCIATED WITH 13215% HIGHER RATES OF VIOLENT CRIME AND 11% HIGHER RATES OF FIREARM HOMICIDE I'D ALSO LIKE TO SAY THAT IN THE HOUSE SUPPORTS AB TESTIMONY THEY BROUGHT UP COST A LOT AND COST TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT IF THAT IS THE ONE CONCERN THEY COULD CONSIDER RAISING THE FEES FOR COMPACT CONCEALED WEAPONS PERMIT APPLICANTS FOR THESE REASONS BRADY AND BRADY CALIFORNIA STRONGLY OPPOSE AB TWO ZERO THREE THREE.

MISTER CHAIR THERE IS NO ONE WHO SIGNAL BUT THEY WISH TO SPEAK THEY WILL BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE MEMBERS WITH ANY COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. MISTER SEA AFTER THANK YOU. SO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD THIS ISN'T SO MUCH A BIG% GUN RIGHTS BILL IS IT IS A GOVERNMENT STREAMLINING BILL TO ELIMINATE REDUNDANCY AND- AND TAKE AWAY SOME OF THOSE PROCESS SEES- CLOG UP THE SYSTEM SO TO SPEAK. WHEN OFFICERS ARE INVOLVED IN DOING ALL OF THAT- IN DOING THIS EVERY TWO YEARS I THINK ANYBODY IN THE ASSEMBLY CAN ATTEST TO TWO YEARS GOES BY PRETTY QUICK- BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE- WE'RE ALWAYS HAVING TO. GET OUT THERE AND HE'D RUN FOR SEATS AGAIN BUT- BUT ANYWAY- I'D LIKE TO BE ADDED AS A CO AUTHOR ON THIS BILL- IF YOU'RE TAKING CO AUTHORS. WE HONOR THAT OKAY IN APPRECIATE THAT AND APPRECIATE THE BILL IN THE ATTEMPT TO HELP STREAMLINE GOVERNMENT A LITTLE BIT. AND I THINK. PEOPLE NEED TO ALSO MAKE THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN- CZW CARRIERS AND THE PEOPLE WHO ARE INVOLVED IN IN IN GUN VIOLENCE- VERY FEW OF THEM ARE C. C. W. CARE. SO SO ANYWAY- PRECIADO YOUR THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY OTHER COMMENTS QUESTIONS. YOU MAY CLOSE THIS IS YOUR FOR WANT TO REGENERATE TODAY DOESN'T CHANGE THE PROCESS WHICH GOT TO GO THROUGH TO GET THE C. C. W. ALL IT'S GOING TO DO EXTENDED TIME. YOUR LICENSE CAN BE REVOKED AT ANY TIME SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR MICHAEL. OKAY SO THIS IS AS YOU PROBABLY NOTICED BILL TRIED. IN THIS COMMITTEE- SEVERAL TIMES IT'S AND IT FAILED MISS COMMITTEE SERVICE OVER TIME. IN A REASON IS BECAUSE THE LAST THING LAW. THE EXISTING C. C. W. PERMIT HOLDERS- I THINK ARE PROBABLY. THE MOST CONSCIENTIOUS AND OF GOOD MORAL CHARACTER PROBABLY IN THE WORLD- IT IS BECAUSE WE HAVE THIS PROCESS IN PLACE THAT THEY HAVE TO COME BACK. EVERY TWO YEARS. EXTENDING IT MAY HAVE SOME ADVERSE WITH THAT TERM- IF IT IF IT AIN'T BROKE DON'T FIX IT. WELL RIGHT NOW THE SYSTEM. ISN'T BROKEN- IN THAT COULD BE CORRECTED BUT I DON'T THINK ANY CCW. OWNER HAS BEEN INVOLVED IN MASS SHOOTINGS OR ANY OF THAT- AND I FIRMLY BELIEVE IS BECAUSE- GOVERNMENT. WHICH DOESN'T ALWAYS WORK ALL THE TIME THIS IS ONE AREA. WHERE WE'RE AT 1100% ACCURACY AND THE ROAD WANTED PERCENT ABILITY TO ENSURE THAT THE PUBLIC STAY SAFE- AND SO UNFORTUNATE WITH DAD I'M GOING TO. RECOMMEND A NO VOTE BUT I UNDERSTAND WAT YOU'RE WHAT YOU'RE SAYING BUT REALLY WOULD LIKE FOR YOU TO LOOK AT. WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW IN REALITY. THAT THAT THE C. C. W. CARRIERS RIGHT NOW BECAUSE OF THE- WHICH I THINK YOU'RE CALLING STRINGENT. REGULATIONS BECAUSE OF STRINGENT REGULATIONS I THINK THE PUBLIC HAS BEEN SAFE AND WE'VE ENSURE THAT- BECAUSE OF A LIFE CHANGE THE FORCES OR SOMEONE GETTING ANGRIER THE MENTAL STATUS CHANGE OVER FIVE YEARS- WE CAN GET THEM A LOT SOONER. AND HOPEFULLY TAKE AWAY THEIR GUNS OBVIOUSLY WE MUST BE DOING IT BECAUSE AGAIN. THERE HASN'T BEEN ANY ANY PROBLEMS WITH THAT. ALL THE ROLE ALL OF PROVIDE THAT OKAY. AB TWO ZERO THREE THREE BY THE MEMBER SMITH THE MOTION IS TO PASS JONES SAWYER. JONES SAWYER NO LACKEY LACKEY HI BONTA BONTA KNOW BRIAN BRIAN NO QUIRK YOU KNOW QUICK NOTES SANTIAGO SANTIAGO KNOWS THEY ARE TO. I THINK THEY ARE TOO HIGH.

A BY UNANIMOUS CONSENT. OKAY THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS TODAY I'M HERE TO PRESENT AB TWENTY THREE THIRTY THREE OUR NATION IS FACING A CRISIS THESE LAST FEW YEARS HAVE SEEN A MAJOR INCREASE TARGETED AN AMBUSH STYLE ATTACKS AGAINST OUR POLICE OFFICERS LAST YEAR ALONE THREE HUNDRED FORTY SIX OFFICERS WERE SHOT IN THE LINE OF DUTY.

THE TWENTY UP ONE OTHERS INJURED WHAT AT STATUTES AS A POLICE OFFICER TO THE LIST OF CHARACTERISTICS WHICH QUALIFY A CRIMINAL ACT AS A HATE CRIME. OTHER STATES HAVE ALREADY RECOGNIZED THE DANGERS POLICE OFFICERS FACE DUE TO THEIR PROFESSION. AND HAVE TAKEN STEPS TO ENSURE THAT THEY ARE PROTECTED. THE IT IS THEREFORE TO TIME THAT CALIFORNIA FOLLOW SUIT IN ENSURING THAT ACTS OF-VIOLENCE AGAINST POLICE OFFICERS IS RECOGNIZED AS A HATE CRIME. THIS BILL IS CRUCIAL AT A TIME WHEN LAW ENFORCEMENT IS WORKING TO BRIDGE THE DIVISION WITHIN THE COMMUNITIES THEY POLICE. LET'S REINFORCE THAT NOTION. THAT INDIVIDUAL SO TARGET POLICE OFFICERS BECAUSE OF THE BADGE THEY WEAR. SHOULD BE PUNISHED FOR THAT MALICE WHETHER THOSE OFFICERS ARE SITTING IN A PATROL CAR OUTSIDE A METRO STATION OR REPORTING UP ON A MULTIPLE CAR CRASH AB TWENTY THREE THIRTY THREE SENDS A MESSAGE THAT TARGETED ATTACKS ON POLICE WON'T BE TOLERATED INSURERS ADDITIONAL CRIMINAL PENALTIES IF A CRIME SPECIFICALLY TARGETS A VICTIM BECAUSE OF THEY ARE A POLICE OFFICER.

HM GOOD MORNING GERMANY WHERE MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE PENSION AND I GUESS ISSUE OF THE SAN MARINO COUNTY THE MEN AND WOMEN OF LAW ENFORCEMENT USED TO RISK THEIR LIVES FOR THEIR COMMUNITIES. THEY DO THIS DESPITE THE DAILY REST OF THEIR PERSONAL SAFETY. TOO OFTEN WEARING A UNIFORM SUBJECTION TO BECOMING A TARGET OF VIOLENT AND HATEFUL CRIMINALS. AN EXAMPLE OF THIS IS WHAT WE SEE ON NATIONAL NEWS WHERE LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS ARE BEING SHOT AND KILLED WELL SIMPLY SITTING IN THEIR PATROL CARS. THERE ARE WORKING DEDICATION AND NOT GONE UNNOTICED AND ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY THREE THIRTY THREE WELL RESTORE JUSTICE TO THE MEMBERS OF OUR PROFESSION WERE VICTIMIZED FOR SIMPLY PUTTING ON A BADGE. ASSAULT AGAINST A PEACE OFFICER SALAS 7% INCREASE NATIONALLY BETWEEN TWENTY NINETEEN TO TWENTY TWENTY. WITH OVER SIXTY THOUSAND ASSAULTS OCCURRING IN TWENTY TWENTY ALONE STEPPING UP IN GOVERNING WRONG THIS BILL SOLDERING CO AUTHORS HAVE COURAGEOUSLY STEPPED UP BY WRITING A PROVISION OUTLINING A PEACE OFFICER AS A PROTECTED CLASS WITH RESPECT TO HATE CRIMES. A DESIGNATION THAT NOT ONLY SHOWS WE'RE WILLING TO SUPPORT LAW ENFORCEMENT WELL ONE AND MAYBE TERROR VIOLENCE AGAINST THEM. RECRUITING MEN AND WOMEN TO JOIN LAW ENFORCEMENT IS BECOMING INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT DON'T AND THEIR FAMILIES WORRY THEY MIGHT BECOME ONE MORE STATISTIC A VICTIM OF VIOLENCE TARGETING LAW ENFORCEMENT. WHEN THERE'S NO ONE LEFT TO ANSWER THE CALL WE WILL HAVE TO ASK OURSELVES WHAT MORE COULD WE HAVE DONE. LIKE MANY AGENCIES ACROSS THE STATE AND COUNTRY OUR DEFICIT FACED INCREASED VIOLENCE IN FEBRUARY OF TWO THOUSAND TWELVE DETECTIVE JEREMIAH MACKAY WAS SHOT AND KILLED BY CHRISTOPHER DORNER WHO SPECIFICALLY SET UP TO TARGET COPS. IN OCTOBER TWENTY EIGHTEEN DEPUTY ROBERT JOHN WAS SHOT TO A CLOSED DOOR OR ANSWERING A CALL FOR SERVICE. IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE PARDUBICE EXPERIENCE SIGNIFICANT SPIKES IN VIOLENCE W. DUSTIN WILSON WAS SHOT AND WAS NEARLY KILLED WHILE ON A VEHICLE CHECK. SERGEANT DOMINICK BACA WAS SHOT AND KILLED WHILE TRYING TO APPREHEND THE SUSPECT AFTER PURSUIT. DEBBIE CARLOS VELASCO WAS THE VICTIM OF AN UNPROVOKED AMBUSH WITH AN ASSAULT RIFLE ASSEMBLY ATTEMPTING TO MAKE A TRAFFIC STOP. THE FOLLOWING NUMBERS REPRESENT THE NUMBER OF DEPUTY SHERIFF'S OFFICIALS IN SAN MARINO COUNTY. AND TWENTY SIXTEEN TWO HUNDRED SIXTY NINE. IN. TWENTY SEVENTEEN FOUR HUNDRED SEVENTEEN TWENTY EIGHTEEN SIX EIGHTY SIX. TWENTY NINETEEN SIX TWENTY SIX AND TWENTY TWENTY SIX SEVENTY THREE. FROM TWENTY SIX TO TWENTY TWENTY THERE'S BEEN A HUNDRED AND 50% INCREASE IN VIOLENCE AGAINST OUR JAPANESE. ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY THREE THIRTY THREE CAN HELP SLOW THE ONGOING ASSAULT ON PEACE OFFICERS AND SEND A POWERFUL MESSAGE THAT THERE'S NO PLACE FOR HATE BASED VIOLENCE INCLUDING VIOLENCE DIRECTED AT MEN AND WOMEN. WHO HAVE CHOSEN TO SERVE A LIFE OF SERVICE. I INCLUDING PEACE OFFICERS IN LIST OF ACTUAL OR PERCEIVED CHARACTERISTICS OF VICTIMS THAT QUALIFY. WILL BE BETTER EQUIPPED TO DEFEND OUR OFFICERS IN INSTANCES WHERE HATE CRIMES ARE PERPETRATED AGAINST THEM OUT OF BIAS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND CONSIDERATION I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK THAT YOU PASS ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY THREE THIRTY THREE. THANK YOU WE WILL NOW. GO TO OPPOSITION. YOU HAVE FIVE MINUTES. THE. MARGO GEORGE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION I WANT TO SAY THAT WERE SYMPATHETIC TO THE TOUGH AND SOMETIMES THANKLESS JOB THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT HAVE AS A PUBLIC DEFENDER FOR OVER THIRTY YEARS I SAW FIRST HAND WHAT ON A LAW ENFORCEMENT HAD TO DEAL WITH- AB TWENTY THREE THIRTY THREE WILL NOT MAKE POLICING SAFER CRIMES AGAINST POLICE ARE ALREADY PUNISHED WITH HARSHER PUNISHMENTS THAN CRIMES AGAINST CIVILIANS RANGING FROM DOUBLE THE COUNTY JAIL SENTENCE FOR ASSAULT TO ON. THE DEATH PENALTY OR L. WANT FOR MURDER. HATE CRIMES HAS TRADITIONALLY BEEN A CATEGORY BASED ON DISCRIMINATION AGAINST IMMUTABLE CHARACTERISTICS SUCH AS AGE. COLOR DISABILITY GENDER I. D. NATIONAL ORIGIN RACE SEX AND SEXUAL ORIENTATION. SOME OF US IN THIS ROOM HAVE THOSE CHARACTERISTICS. AND WE CAN'T CHANGE THEM I CAN'T CHANGE MY AGE I CAN'T CHANGE THE FACT THAT I'M FEMALE WELL PERHAPS I COULD MAIL DAYS BUT DON'T CHOOSE TO IT WOULD BE VERY- BUT LIFE ALTERING- BUT PEACE OFFICER STATUS IS DIFFERENT IT'S AN OCCUPATION THAT CAN BE EASILY CHANGED. ADDING POLICE OFFICERS HAS THE POTENTIAL FOR LONG TERM DISTORTION OF THE HATE CRIME CATEGORY. BECAUSE UNFORTUNATELY WE'VE SEEN IN THE LAST NUMBER OF YEARS OF QUITE A FEW INDIVIDUAL OCCUPATIONS TARGETED. BUSINESS INSIDER REPORTED IN OCTOBER OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE THAT 31% OF HOSPITAL NURSES HAVE REPORTED AN INCREASE IN VIOLENCE UP FROM 22% IN MARCH OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE ONE AND FOUR NURSES FACES PHYSICAL VIOLENCE ON THE JOB. AND THE HOSPITAL IS THE MOST DANGEROUS SPORT ONE OF THE MOST DANGEROUS WORKPLACES IN THE COUNTRY ACCORDING TO OSHA. SALES CLERKS HAVE BEEN SHOT AND KILLED FOR ASKING ON CUSTOMERS TO WEAR FACEMASK. ELECTION POLL WORKERS SURVEYS HAVE FOUND THAT 17% OF AMERICA'S A LOCAL ELECTIONS WERE OFFICIALS HAVE BEEN THREATENED DUE TO THEIR JOBS DURING THE TWENTY TWENTY ELECTION CYCLE AND THE CO THAT NINETEEN PANDEMIC. AB TWENTY THREE EIGHT. THIRTY THREE IS BAD PUBLIC POLICY BECAUSE IT DIMINISHES THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE CRIME DESIGNATION AND FOLLOWS THE FILLED PARADIGM OF TRYING TO DEAL WITH OUR SOCIAL PROBLEMS WITH INCREASED CRIMINALIZATION AND CARS AND INCARCERATION. SO WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR NO VOTE ON A B. TWENTY THREE THIRTY THREE. THANK YOU ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN THE IN THE ROOM THAT ARE IN OPPOSITION. WHEN I GO TO THE PHONE LINES WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION- TO AB. TWO THREE THREE THREE TWENTY THREE THIRTY THREE ITEM NUMBER TWELVE.

ANDREY AND KRISTINA BONTA DELI ON WITH SAMBAR DINO FREEDOM ALL AND PROJECT AMIGA IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU. ONE ONE FORTY FOUR. PARDON ME. LINE ONE FORTY FOUR. AND JUST ANOTHER MOMENT. HELLO CAN YOU HEAR ME. YES HI GARY WITH PROGRAM PRIVATE IN OPPOSITION OF AB TWO THREE THREE THREE. BY. TWO THIRTY NINE. GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS GOING TO CO SIGN ON BEHALF OF THE ENTIRE DEFINITION WEEK WE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE AB. TWO THREE THREE THREE. MISTER CHAIR THERE IS NO ONE ELSE TO SIGNAL BUT THEY WISH TO SPEAK. THANK YOU WE NOW BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS YES RIGHT. NOT POLICING IS AN INCREDIBLY DANGEROUS PROFESSION- AND I APPRECIATE WHAT THE AUTHORS TRYING TO DO THERE AS WAS ALREADY MENTIONED THERE ARE ALREADY A NUMBER OF LAWS. THE PLACING HIM HAS WITH A CRIMES AGAINST POLICE OFFICERS PENAL CODE. TWO FORTY ONE C. SPECIFICALLY DEFINES ASSAULT ON A POLICE OFFICER AND REYES THE PUNISHMENT BY UP TO ONE YEAR IN COUNTY JAIL OR A FINE OF TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR BOTH JAIL AND A FINE IT'S LITERALLY DOUBLE THE PUNISHMENT. THAT SOMEONE ASSAULTING A PERSON WAS NOT A POLICE OFFICER WE GET. THIS SIX SIX FOUR E. ATTEMPTED MURDER ON A PEACE OFFICER. RESULT RESULT IN A WHILE. TWO FORTY THREE BE BETTER IN A POLICE OFFICER TO MISDEMEANOR BUT THIS TO FORTY THREE C. WHICHRAISE THE TOLL WOBBLER TO FORTY THREE D. WHICH RAISE IT TO. A SERIOUS FELONY. ONE FORTY EIGHT BE RESISTING ARREST WHICH GETS ADDED TO MANY MANY MANY MANY MANY MANY ENCOUNTERS WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF PROTECTED CLASSES IT WAS ITERESTING TO ME THAT ONE OF THE WITNESSES BROUGHT UP CHRISTOPHER DORNER WHO HIMSELF WAS A LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER WHO WAS UPSET FEELING THAT HIS PROTECTED CLASSES A BLACK OFFICER HAD BEEN VIOLATED BY SOME OF HIS COLLEAGUES IT'S A TERRIBLY TRAGIC HORRIBLE. HORRIBLE CASE BUT I DON'T THINK THAT IT RISES TO THE CONVERSATION ABOUT HATE WHEN WE HAVE A IMMUTABLE CHARACTERISTICS FOR BLACK FOLKS ARE JEWISH COMMUNITY- API COMMUNITY AS WE HEARD EARLIER TODAY THERE'S A LOT WE'VE GOT TO DO TO ADDRESS HATE AND I DON'T THINK YOUR CHOSEN PROFESSION RISES TO THE SAME. AS THE IMMUTABLE CHARACTERISTICS THAT MANY FOLKS WERE BORN WITH SO I WILL BE RESPECTFULLY VOTING NO ON THIS ONE. YOUR COMMENT. WITH THAT YOU MAY CLOSE MISTER SMITH IS THIS BILLS DOES NOT DO ANYTHING FOR REAL RESISTING ARREST WITH THE DEPUTY IS STRICTLY AMBUSH STYLE ASSAULT ON OUR MEN AND WOMEN IN UNIFORM BECAUSE THEY WERE THE BATCH I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AYE VOTE. AND I AND I SYMPATHIZE IN FACT I OF MY BLOOD STILL BOILS WHEN I SEE YOUNG PEOPLE JUST SCREAM AND HOLLER AT. LAWFORD'S OFFICE WHO JUST DOING YOUR JOB LIKE KEEPING THE PEACE AND WE DO HAVE TO DO SOMETHING PREEMPTIVE FIGURE OUT A WAY. TO GET- LAW ENFORCEMENT THE KIND OF RESPECT THEY USED TO HAVE IT'S OBVIOUSLY GONE WAY DOWN. ANYBODY THAT'S WILLING TO- KILL A LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER REALLY SHOULD NOT BE AMONGST US AND SHOULD BE TAKEN OFF THE STREET AND SO I BELIEVE WE DO HAVE LAWS THAT IT RECOGNIZES THAT THAT THAT PERSON IS PROBABLY THE MOST DANGEROUS PERSON YOU COULD HAVE SHOULD HAVE IF YOU'RE NOT AFRAID TO KILL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER AND- THE BUT I THINK WE DO HAVE EXISTING LAWS THAT CAN THAT CAN HANDLE THAT CAN TAKE CARE OF THAT AND ULTIMATELY PROTECT THE PUBLIC. IF NOT THE LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS AND FORTUNATE WITH THAT I WILL RECOMMENDED A NO VOTE. PROVIDE THE MOTION. CALDERON ON AB TWENTY THREE THIRTY THREE BY SEVEN MEMBER SMITH THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE JONES SAWYER JONES SAWYER NO LACKEY LACKEY HI BONTA BONTA KNOW BRIAN. NO BRIAN NO QUIRK. QUIRK KNOWS SANTIAGO SEYARTO THEY ARE TO I. THE MEASURE FAILED. DOES HE WANT THAT. OKAY YOU'RE WELCOME MISTER TEEN- I DON'T NUMBER SIX A. B. ONE NINE FOUR SEVEN NINETEEN FORTY SEVEN. THANK YOU MATURE LET ME JUST DOUBLE. THANK THE CHAIR AND ALL THE COMMITTEE STAFFER WORKING WITH ME ON THIS BILL WE ARE GLADLY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS- AB NINETEEN FORTY SEVEN- STEMS FROM THE SIGNIFICANT JUMP INHATE CRIMES IN OUR STATE. AND IN OUR COUNTRY IN PARTICULAR TARGETED TOWARD ASIAN AMERICANS- IN PARTICULAR SAN FRANCISCO A RECENT STATS SHOWED THAT IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE HATE CRIMES JUMPED OVER FIVE HUNDRED PERCENT. IN IN LA HE CRIMES JUMPED OVER A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY THREE PERCENT- TARGETING- API'S HAVING SAID THAT WHILE THERE THE JUMP AGAINST API'S ARE STILL THE LARGEST. AFRICAN AMERICANS STILL REDUCE REMAIN UNFORTUNATELY THE LARGEST- THE LARGEST RECIPIENTS OF HATE CRIMES AND HATE INCIDENTS IN OUR STATE. THIS WEEK THIS BILL IS REALLY- FOCUSED ON REQUIRING LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES TO ADOPT A DETAILED SPECIFIC POLICY INSTRUCTING OFFICERS ON HOW TO IDENTIFY RESPOND TO AND REPORT HE CRIMES- WE SEE TOO OFTEN IN SOME COUNTIES WHERE THERE ARE NO HATE CRIMES A REPORT I BELIEVE SAMPOERNA DINO RIVERSIDE.A REPORTED- ZERO TWO NO HATE CRIMES SAID THAT HE COMES AREN'T OCCURRING IN THOSE JURISDICTIONS JUSTICE STOP PERHAPS OFFICERS ARE ABLE TO RESPOND THEY CAN'T REPORT OR PEOPLE DON'T FEEL COMFORTABLE COMING FORWARD. REGARDLESS WHAT WE WANT IS WE WANT- POST TV WORKING WITH EVERY SINGLE LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY IN THE ENTIRE STATE TO DEVELOP A BEST PRACTICE- SO THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES HAVE THE ABILITY TO CALL AND TRAIN THEIR OFFICERS ON REALLY HOW TO BEST RESPOND IDENTIFY. AND TO REPORT THESE HATE CRIMES ON. I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE THAT THESE. INCIDENTS ARE UNFORTUNATELY AND WE'VE SEEN A RISE OF THE LAST COUPLE YEARS THERE'S BEEN A HUGE FRUSTRATION- THAT HAS ALSO RISEN DUE TO COLD IT AND FORTUNATELY WAS CERTAIN COMMUNITIES BEING TARGETED ARE BEING BLAMED FOR THE VIRUS WE'RE SEEING. THAT UNFORTUNATELY- YOU KNOW MY COMMUNITY IN THE APP I COMMUNITY HAS BEEN ONE OF THE MAJOR TARGETS- JUST A FEW THINGS THAT AB NINETEEN FORTY SEVEN DOESN'T DO IT DOESN'T EXPAND PENALTIES OR EXPAND WHAT A HATE CRIME IS SO DOESN'T CHANGE THE DEFINITIONS. IT ALSO ENSURES THAT HATE CRIMES ARE REPORTED AS HATE CRIMES AND VICTIMS- I HAVE THE ABILITY TO GO GET THE RESPECT AND THE DIGNITY THEY DESERVE ALL ACROSS CALIFORNIA SO THAT- WE HAVE CHARLES JOHN HERE FROM THE CALIFORNIA ASIAN PACIFIC AMERICAN BAR ASSOCIATION- AS OUR FIRST WITNESS. AT THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIR JONES SAWYER MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS CHARLES JOHN I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA ASIAN PACIFIC AMERICAN BAR ASSOCIATION. DEEPLY APPRECIATE YOUR TIME AND YOUR CONSIDERATION. I THE THAT THESE NEW ALTHOUGH THEY HAVE BEEN RISING WHAT'S DIFFERENT NOW IS THAT. WE HAVE TECHNOLOGY TO BEAR WITNESS TO THIS HATE. AND YOU MAY HAVE SEEN. THE VIDEO- OUT OF JURISDICTION IN NEW YORK- QUEEN AMERICAN WOMAN NAMED ESTHER LEE. WHO WAS TAKING A TRAIN HOME. AND MAN APPROACHED HER- CASSIRER DIDN'T RECEIVE THE REACTION THAT HE WANTED- SPEWED BOTH GUARANTEES AT HER- VULGAR GESTURES. AND SPIT ON HER TWICE. AND CALLED HER A KERRIER. A KERRIER. AND THE INVESTIGATING OFFICER IN THAT SITUATION- DESPITE THE REQUEST THE VICTIM. REFUSED TO. INVESTIGATE IS A HATE CRIME AND IN ADDITION REFUSE TO EVEN INCLUDE THE WORD CARRIER IN THE REPORT BECAUSE IT WAS NOT RELEVANT IN HIS VIEW DESPITE HER REQUEST. SHE INQUIRED AND HE SAID THAT IT WASN'T BECAUSE THE PERSON DIDN'T SAY ASIAN CARRIER OR CHINESE CARRIER IT DIDN'T RISE TO THE LEVEL OF THE HATE CRIME. THESE CRIMES CERTAINLY ARE. BECOMING A CUTE IN THE TIME OF COATED- BUT THEY DIDN'T START WITH CODE- IN TWENTY SIXTEEN IN. WHAT I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE WAS A VERY DIVISIVE- ELECTION THAT'S WHEN WE STARTED SEEING THE RISE OF HATE CRIMES. NOT JUST AGAINST EAST ASIANS AGAINST IMMIGRANTS CALIFORNIA WAS THE NUMBER ONE A PLACE WHERE WE START WE HAD THE GREATEST RICE THE NUMBER OF HATE CRIMES THESE PILOTS AND HATEFUL ACTS- IMMIGRANTS IN PARTICULAR HISPANICS- WORK THAT WE SIDE DRAMATIC JUMP- THAT'S WHEN I PERSONALLY STARTED BECOME INVOLVED IN THIS ISSUE- WHEN I HEARD ABOUT SIX AMERICAN MAN. STOPPED AT A STOP SIGN IN RICHMOND CALIFORNIA NOT TOO FAR FROM- NOT TOO FAR FROM WHERE I LIVE- HE- A WHITE PICKUP TRUCK FILLED WITH MEN. PULLED UP ALONGSIDE HIM THREW A BEER CAN AT HIS- CAR CHASE THEM TO THE NEXT STOP WHITE AND WHEN HE ROLLED DOWN HIS WINDOW. TWO TALKED TO- THESE PEOPLE COSTING HIM. EXCUSE ME HE ADDED THEY REACHED INTO. HIS CAR AND KNOCKED OFF HIS RELIGIOUSLY MANDATED- HEAD DRESS- GRABBED HIS HAIR AND- CUT HIS RIDICULOUSLY MANDATED- TOP NOT. IN THERE EVEN THERE BECAUSE THERE ARE PEOPLE DON'T ALWAYS USE THE N. WORD OR THE C. WORD. AB BUT IT TAKES SOME TIME TO INVESTIGATE. AND YOU KNOW WE ALL KNOW THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS ARE SOMETIMES OVER TAX THEIR OVERTAXED AND- WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS IT HELPS ASSIST OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS BY PROVIDING TRAINING AND POLICIES SO THAT THEY- KNOW A THING WHEN THEY SEE IT. THEY KNOW IT WHEN THEY SEE IT. AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER AT TEEN- WHO I THINK FOR HIS LEADERSHIP- EXPRESSED THIS IS NOT EXPAND PENALTIES IT DOES NOT EXPANDED DEFINITION OF HATE CRIMES IT S. SISTER LAW ENFORCEMENT DEPARTMENTS BY- MAKING SURE THAT OVER TAX POLICE DEPARTMENTS I GET THE TRAINING THAT THEY NEED TO DO A PROPER INVESTIGATION. I'LL JUST CLOSE WITH ONE PERSONAL STORY WHICH IS GREW UP IN DETROIT AND FLINT MICHIGAN. AND YOU KNOW WHAT WE SEE TODAY YOU KNOW- THE HIM MY SISTER AND I HAD TO WALK THROUGH A FIELD TO GET OUR ELEMENTARY SCHOOL GILLISPIE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL AND- WHAT YOU KNOW WHAT WE WERE AFRAID OF WALKING THROUGH THAT FIELD. BECAUSE. IN THE PAST I REMEMBER THAT DISTINCT. DID DISTINCT MEMORY OF BEING CALLED A CHECK OR CHEN CHONG OR GO BACK TO CHINA I AM KOREAN BY THE WAY- AND- THAT FEELING OF FEAR WHEN NEIGHBORHOOD CHILDREN WOULD THROW ROCKS AT OUR HOME. IN A WET WHEN I MOVED TO CALIFORNIA TWENTY FOUR YEARS AGO- AND STARTED TO RAISE A FAMILY HERE YOU KNOW I SAW CALIFORNIA AS A- YOU KNOW BUT BUT AS A TRUE MELTING POT A PLACE OF. BEGIN A BIT THAT THAT IN MY VIEW HAD YOU KNOW THAT THIS WAS A PLACE OF REFUGE FOR SOMEONE FROM THE API COMMUNITY- MY PARENTS VISITED ME FOR EIGHTY EIGHT DAYS IN SAN FRANCISCO EIGHTY EIGHT DAYS IN THAT TIME THEY WERE ACCOSTED THREE TIMES- VIOLENTLY ATTACKED TWO TIMES AND THEY ARE AFRAID THEY ARE AFRAID OF LIVING IN SAN FRANCISCO THEY'RE FREE TO VISIT ME THEY CAN'T LEAVE THEY ARE AFRAID OF LEAVING THEIR HOUSE- HATE CRIMES- THIS IS NOT GONNA SOLVE. HATE CRIMES THIS IS NOT GOING TO ELIMINATE HATE- BUT WHAT THIS DOES DO IS. MAKE A- MAKE A CHANGE TO HELP OUR OFFICERS. I INVESTIGATE- AND SEE IT WHEN IT OCCURS THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION.

THE HINDU AMERICAN FOUNDATION THE- CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF HUMAN RELATIONS ORGANIZATIONS. AND THE CENTER FOR THE STUDY OF HATE AND EXTREMISM AT CCAC CAL STATE OF TIMBER DINO. THIS BILL IS BASED ON THE- FINDINGS OF THE AUDIT THAT THESE- RIBBON KANSEN CHU GOT AT THE REQUEST OF- SO MANY THE SAME SUPPORTING GROUPS. WHICH FOUND THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT CALIFORNIA HAS NOT ADEQUATELY IDENTIFIED REPORTED OR RESPONDED TO HATE CRIMES IT IT FOCUSES PARTICULARLY ON THE AUDIT RECOMMENDATIONS CONCERNING. WHAT LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES SHOULD DO WHICH ARE TO HAVE FORMAL POLICIES TO GUIDE EVERY OFFICER AND THE POLICIES BUILD OUT OF THIS BILL ARE BASED ON THE REAL WORLD EXPERIENCE OF- COMMUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA THEY'RE VERY AT THAT ARE SUBJECT HE GRABS THE EXAMPLES ARE ALL REAL WORLD EXAMPLES IS NOT HYPOTHETICAL FROM THE- SECONDLY IS. ABOUT THE USE OF A SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT FORM TO THE OFFICERS THE FIRST RESPONDING OFFICER CAN CONDUCT AN INVESTIGATION ON THE SCENE- INTERVIEW THE WITNESSES ON THE SCENE LOOK FOR EVIDENCE ON THE SCENE. AND THE THIRD IS- IS MANDATED TRAINING WHICH- THE LEGISLATURE ADOPTED LAST YEAR AND THIS REQUIRES UP AS AN ACTUAL SCHEDULE WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENS. ON THE FOURTH PART OF THE- A RECOMMENDATION OF THE AUDIT WAS THE DOJ SHOULD EXERCISE LEADERSHIP.

BONTA HI BRIAN HI BRIAN HI QUIRK. QUIRK I SAN DIEGO. SAN DIEGO I SEYARTO. THEY ARE TOO HIGH. THAT MEASURE PASSED. NOW WE HAVE ASSEMBLYMEMBER KILL WEBER- AB. TWENTY ONE EIGHTY FIVE. FROM. YOU MAY BEGIN WHENEVER YOU'RE READY THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND MEMBERS I WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE AND ITS STAFF FOR ALL ITS WORK AND I WILL BE ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS. I'M HERE TO PRESENT AB TWENTY ONE EIGHTY FIVE WHICH ALLOWSSURVIVORS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ASSAULT TO HAVE ACCESS TO MEDICAL EVIDENTIARY EXAMINATION. DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IS A CRIME THAT OFTEN ESCALATES WITHOUT INTERVENTION. RESEARCH DEMONSTRATES THAT EVEN ONE INCIDENT OF STRANGULATION IS A PREDICTOR OF A FUTURE ATTEMPT OF MURDER AND ONE OF THE MOST LETHAL FORMS OF INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE. CURRENTLY SURVIVORS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE HAVE AN EQUAL ACCESS TO CARE. AS THEY ARE NOT PROVIDED THE SAME RIGHT TO MEDICAL EVIDENTIARY EXAMS A SEXUAL ASSAULT VICTIMS. SO SPEAKING PLAINLY IF YOU HAVE BEEN SEXUALLY ASSAULTED THEN YOU WILL COME INTO THE HOSPITAL AND SEE EITHER A SPECIALIST THAT'S A SAFER SAME PROVIDER OR ANOTHER PROVIDER LIKE MYSELF WHO HAS BEEN TRAINED IN THE PROPER WAY TO DO THESE EXAMS COLLECT THE FORENSIC EVIDENCE AND SURE THAT THE PATIENT IS GIVEN ACCESS TO MEDICATIONS SOCIAL WORK AND OTHER RESOURCES. THAT THEY MAY NEED PRIOR TO BEING DISCHARGED. THIS IS NOT THE CASE FOR MOST VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. TO ADDRESS THIS IN FEBRUARY OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN. SAN DIEGO COUNTY IMPLEMENT A COUNTY WIDE PILOT PROGRAM WITH AN ON CALL FORENSIC NURSE EXAMINER TO DOCUMENT STRANGULATION AND OTHER INJURIES FROM DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ASSAULT. FROM TWENTY SEVENTEEN TO TWENTY TWENTY THE PILOT PROGRAM RESULTED IN MORE EXAMS BEING CONDUCTED AND A 15% DECREASE IN DOMESTIC VIOLENCE HOMICIDES SINCE THE START OF THE PILOT PROGRAM. AB TWENTY FIVE EIGHTY FIVE WOULD EXPAND THIS NECESSARY TREATMENT FOR VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE STATEWIDE. IT INCREASES A STATEWIDE FUNDING STREAM THROUGH THE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES TO REIMBURSE PROVIDERS FOR THOSE CONDUCTING MEDICAL EVIDENTIARY EXAMS FOR DEMANDS FOR VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. IT WILL HELP EXPAND ACCESS TO MEDICAL EVIDENTIARY EXAMS WHICH WILL BRING ABOUT EARLY DETECTION AND INTERVENTION WHICH ULTIMATELY HAS BEEN PROVEN TO SAVE LIVES AND INCREASE FAMILY SAFETY AND WELLNESS. IN ADDITION LOCAL SEXUAL ASSAULT RESPONSE TEAMS SEXUAL ASSAULT FORENSIC EXAMINER TEAMS AND OTHER QUALIFIED MEDICAL EVIDENTIARY EXAMINERS WILL PERFECT WILL DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT BREAST PRACTICE WRITTEN POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR MAINTAINING PATIENT CONFIDENTIALITY. THIS BILL IS SPONSORED BY THE SAN DIEGO COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE AND SUPPORTED BY THE CALIFORNIA CHAPTER OF THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF SOCIAL WORKERS AND POLICE OFFCER RESEARCH ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA. HERE TO SPEAK WITH ME TODAY IS TRACI PRIOR CHIEF DEPUTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY SAN DIEGO COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE AND MICHELLE SOARES A CALIFORNIA SEXUAL ASSAULT FORENSIC EXAMINER ASSOCIATION NURSE THANK YOU. THANK YOU MY NAME IS TRACY PRIOR I'M A CHIEF DEPUTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY IN SAN DIEGO AND HAS SERVED AS A AS A PUBLIC PROSECUTOR FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS OUR DISTRICT ATTORNEY SUMMER STEPHAN IS A PROUD SPONSOR OF AB TWENTY ONE EIGHTY FIVE. MANY YEARS AGO I HEARD A PHRASE THAT STUCK WITH ME. IN THE PRESENCE OF VIOLENCE ONE CANNOT ACHIEVE HEALTH. I HAVE SEEN THE AFTERMATH THAT SERIOUS SEXUAL AND PHYSICAL ASSAULT HAS HAD ON THE VICTIMS OF VIOLENCE. AND HAVE SEEN THE DIFFERENCE THAT QUALITY HEALTH AND SPECIFICALLY A FORENSIC MEDICAL EXAMINATION CAN HAVE TO HELP A VICTIM PROGRESS FROM BEING A SURVIVOR TO A THRIVE ARE. IN A FORENSIC MEDICAL EXAMINATION ESPECIALLY TRAINED NURSE OR DOCTOR EXAMINES A PATIENT WHO'S EXPERIENCED VIOLENCE THEY PROVIDE MEDICAL TREATMENT THE DOCUMENT INJURIES AND THEY CONNECT THAT INDIVIDUAL TO LOCAL SOCIAL SERVICES AND DEVELOP A SAFETY PLAN TOGETHER. THESE HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS ARE UNIQUELY TRAINED IN THE NEUROBIOLOGY OF TRAUMA AND BEST UNDERSTAND THE PSYCHOOGICAL AND SOCIAL PRESSURES THE IMPACT PATIENTS AFFECTED BY VIOLENCE. THESE EXAMINATIONS HAVE BEEN DEEMED THE GOLD STANDARD IN THE FIELD. THE PROBLEM IS THAT CURRENTLY ONLY SEXUAL ASSAULT RAPE VICTIMS ARE LEGALLY ENTITLED TO THESE EXAMINATIONS FREE OF CHARGE. DOMESTIC VIOLENCE VICTIMS EACH DAY IN CALIFORNIA EXPERIENCED SERIOUS VIOLENCE ON THEIR OWN BUT THEY'RE NOT NECESSARILY SEXUALLY ASSAULTED AND THEY DON'T GET ANY ACCESS TO THIS GOLD STANDARD MEDICAL EXAMINATION WE CAN DO BETTER. DOMESTIC VIOLENCE VICTIMS ARE STRANGLED EVERY YEAR WHICH IS ASSOCIATED WITH A SEVEN TIMES HIGHER LIKELIHOOD OF THEM BEING MURDERED BY THEIR ABUSER YET THESE VICTIMS DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO A FREE MEDICAL EXAMINATION WE SHOULD DO BETTER LEGISLATOR PUT AN EXCLAMATION POINT RIGHT IN FRONT OF US WHEN IT DECLARED THE PROTECTION OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE VICTIMS QUOTE HAS BEEN HAMPERED BY THE LACK OF CONSISTENT AND COMPREHENSIVE MEDICAL EXAMINATIONS. THIS BILL WOULD MAKE US BETTER. THE BILL PROVIDES EQUAL ACCESS FOR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE VICTIMS ESPECIALLY THOSE HAVE BEEN STRANGLED. AND THEY BRING DOMESTIC VIOLENCE VICTIMS ON PAR WITH VICTIMS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT AND THIS TRULY IS A PREVENTATIVE PUBLIC HEALTH APPROACH TO PUBLIC SAFETY. MY COUNTY RECOGNIZE THIS GAP IN TWENTY SIXTEEN WE KNEW THERE WERE SPECIALIZED MEDICAL FORMS ALREADY DESIGNED TO TREAT THESE HEALTH EXAMS WE KNEW THERE WERE SPECIALLY TRAINED HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS STANDING AT THE READY TO PERFORM THEM. BUT THERE WAS NO FUNDING AND NO MANDATE IN THE LAW FOR THEM. SO WE APPLIED FOR A CAL OH YES STATE GRANT TO PILOT A PROGRAM TO SEE IF IT WOULD WORK. AFTER ALL THAT IS THE PURPOSE OF GRANTS ISN'T IT TO TRY SOMETHING INNOVATIVE AND SMART AND THEN SEEK SUSTAINABLE FUNDING AND LEGISLATIVE SOLUTIONS IF IT TRULY MAKES A DIFFERENCE TO OUR COMMUNITY. WE ROLLED OUT THE PROGRAM IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND NOW A SPECIALLY TRAINED FORENSIC NURSE RESPONSE TWENTY FOUR SEVEN TO SERIOUS DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND STRANGULATION CALLS. TO DATE WE'VE DONE A THOUSAND OF THESE EXAMINATIONS AND OUR OUTCOMES HAVE SAVED LIVES. WE'VE SEEN A VIOLENCE HOMICIDES AND AN 11% REDUCTION IN STRANGULATION TO BEING THE METHOD USED IN HOMICIDES WHEN COMPARING THE YEARS BEFORE THE PROGRAM. AND AFTER. MY COLLEAGUE WILL SHARE THE STORY OF A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE VICTIM WHO HAD A FRACTURED LARYNX BUT WOULD NEVER WOULD HAVE KNOWN IT AND COULD HAVE DIED BUT FOR THE FACT THAT SHE HAD ACCESS. TO THIS FORENSIC MEDICAL EXAMINATION. THE NUMBERS IN THE STORIES AND SAN DIEGO ARE IMPORTANT BUT TAKING A STEP BACK THIS BILL IS SIMPLY ABOUT ACCESS. SEXUAL ASSAULT VICTIMS IN CALIFORNIA GET IMPORTANT AN LIFESAVING HEALTHCARE FOR FREE BUT VICTIMS OF SERIOUS DOMESTIC VIOLENCE DO NOT. IT'S TIME TO CHANGE THAT. I STRONGLY RECOMMEND YOU PASSED TWENTY ONE EIGHTY FIVE OUT OF COMMITTEE TODAY IN DOING SO YOU'LL CHAU DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND STRANGULATION VICTIMS THAT THEIR HEALTH AND THEIR SAFETY. DESERVE AN A PLUS RESPONSE FROM ALL OF US THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN. AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS MICHELLE SHORES. I'VE BEEN A NURSE A REGISTERED NURSE FOR OVER SIXTEEN YEARS I'M ALSO A CERTIFIED EMERGENCY NURSE A PEDIATRIC ADOLESCENT AND- ADULT SEXUAL SALTS CERTIFIED NURSE AND ACTIVISM INNER- I COME TO YOU TODAY I AM THE DIRECTOR OF OUR LOCAL PROGRAM HERE IN SAN DIEGO WHICH GAVE ME A DEEP UNDERSTANDING OF THE NEED A- NEED FOR THESE EXAMS. BUT ALSO- AS A BOARD MEMBER FOR THE CALIFORNIA SEXUAL ASSAULT FORENSIC EXAMINER ASSOCIATION THAT. AND IT'S BEEN AN HONOR IN MY CAREER TO SERVE THE MOST VULNERABLE OF OUR POPULATION I HAVE SEEN FIRST HAND WHAT TRAUMA CAN DO BUT I'VE ALSO WITNESSED WHEN A COMMUNITY COMES TOGETHER WHAT TRAUMA INFORMED CARE AND WRAPAROUND SERVICES CAN DO TO SAVE LIVES. YOU KNOW AS A HEALTH CARE PROVIDER I HAVE A DUTY AND OBLIGATION TO ADVOCATE FOR MY PATIENTS HEALTH AND SAFETY. AND UNEQUAL ACCESS TO THESE EXAMS FOR VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE HAS REALLY BEEN A CHALLENGE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND I'D LIKE TO SHARE WITH YOU A STORY THAT I HAVE CONSENT PERMISSION TO SHARE FROM ONE OF OUR PATIENTS AND I THINK OF HER OFTEN. WHEN WE KNOW BETTER WE CAN DO BETTER. AND BECAUSE SAN DIEGO COUNTY HAS THAT PROCESS IN PLACE FOR THE MEDICAL EVIDENTIARY EXAMS. THIS IS AVAILABLE TO OUR COUNTY WE HAD A PATIENT THAT WAS ODD STRANGLED IN OUR COUNTY FLED TO AN OUTSIDE COUNTY. WHERE SHE WAS OT GIVEN ACCESS TO MEDICAL EVIDENTIARY EXAM. THEREFORE CAME BACK TO OUR COUNTY AFTER SAFETY MEASURES WERE IN PLACE. WAS OFFERED ONE WHERE OUR NURSE- ASSESSED HER AND RECOGNIZED SERIOUS STRANGULATION- SYMPTOMS. THEY HAVE NO VISIBLE INJURY. SHE WAS RECOMMENDED TO GET FURTHER CARE AND HAD A FRACTURED LENNIX. SHE CAME TO ME AND ASKED FOR SOMEONE THAT'S HAD THEIR VOICE BOX BROKEN TO HAVE HER VOICE HEARD. HAD THIS BEEN AVAILABLE IN THAT OTHER COUNTY WITHOUT SPECIALIZED TEAM THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN AN IMMEDIATE RESPONSE THAT WOULD HAVE SAVED HER. HENSCHEL LETHAL OUTCOMES SIX DAYS LATER AFTER WE SAW HER. SO I COME TO YOU TODAY ASKING KNOWING THAT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE FOR CHILDREN WITNESSING IN THE HOME KNOWING INCREASE FOR A SCORES AND PUTTING THIS UP FRONT RESPONSE ACCESS TO VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IS OUR DUTY AS HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS INFRASTRUCTURE EXISTS AND I'D I RECOMMEND AND I VOTE FROM THIS COMMITTEE AND I THINK YOU ALL FOR YOUR TIME TODAY.

SANTIAGO I SEYARTO THEY ARE TOO HIGH. THE MEASURE PASSES. THIS DAVIES AB TWENTY FOUR OH NINE THE LAST ONE OF THE DAY. MOVE THE BILL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS TODAY I'M HERE TO PRESENT AB TWO FOUR OH NINE AT FIRST I WANT TO THANK COMMITTEE STAFFER WORKING WITH MY STAFF AND STAKEHOLDERS AND RECENT AMENDMENTS. UNDER CURRENT LAW YOU KNOW COLD THIRTY FORTY THREE A VICTIM OF A CRIME OR THE VICTIMS NEXT OF KIN HAS A RIGHT TO ATTEND THE INMATE'S PAROLE HEARING WITH THE DESIGNATED REPRESENTATIVE IF THEIR CONTACT INFORMATION IS ON FILE THE BORDER PRO HEARING WILL PROVIDE THE NOTICE IN ADVANCE OF THE HEARING. HOWEVER GIVEN THE PASSAGE OF TIME ANY INFORMATION IS USUALLY OUT OF DATE INSTEAD THE PROSECUTING AGENCY WHICH IS ALSO NOTIFIED IS IN THE BEST POSITION TO CONTACT VICTIMS OR THEIR FAMILIES USING DMV RECORDS AND DATABASE. MOST ALREADY DO BUT IT'S NOT A LEGAL REQUIREMENT UNFORTUNATELY IF THE PROSECUTING AGENCY CHOOSES TO ABSENT ITSELF FROM THE PROCESS VICTIMS OR THEIR FAMILIES ARE LEFT IN THE DARK AS TO THE INMATES CONDUCT WHILE IN PRISON AND THE LIKELIHOOD OF RELEASE WHICH COMPLICATES DECISION TO TEN OR WHAT KIND OF STATEMENT TO MAKE. AB TWO FOUR OH NINE IT'S A SIMPLE MEASURE TO CODIFY THE PRACTICE OF ENSURING DISTRICT ATTORNEY OFFICES NOTIFY VICTIMS OR VICTIMS NEXT OF KIN ABOUT UPCOMING PAROLE HEARINGS. AS WE'RE ALL AWARE OF THE LEGAL SYSTEM IS FAR FROM PERFECT AND CREATES MANY BARRIERS FOR JUSTICE ENSURING WE HELP VICTIMS UNDERSTAND THE PRO PROCESS. AND THE RIGHTS TO HELP FIND CLOSURE AND WHAT ARE MOST TIMES VERY TRAUMATIZING EVENTS. IN THEIR LIFE AGAIN MEMBERS THIS IS STRICTLY JUST NOTIFICATION BILL IT DOES NOT REQUIRE ANY MANDATE TO THE DA. TO GET INVOLVED IN PRO PROCESS IT MERELY JUST REQUIRES THEM TO NOTIFY THE VICTIM ABOUT A PAROLE HEARING. WITH ME HERE TODAY VIA PHONE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS IS ATTORNEY JOHN MCKINNEY I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU. JOHN MCKINNEY READY TO TESTIFY. EIGHTEEN T. OPERATE OPEN UP LINE. ERARD MISTER CHIP. PLEASE PLEASE GO AHEAD. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS JOHN MCKINNEY I'M A DEPUTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY I WANT TO MAKE IT CLEAR THAT I'M SPEAKING FOR MYSELF TODAY MY OPINION DOES NOT REPRESENT THE VIEWS OF OUR OFFICE OR OF THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY- WE COME BEFORE YOU TODAY. ASKING YOU TO SUPPORT AB TWO PORT THERE ARE NINE WHICH WAS INSPIRED. BY THE DEATH OF A YOUNG MAN WHOSE CASES ARE PROSECUTED. YOUNG MARQUIS FOR BLOCK WAS EIGHTEEN YEARS OLD HE'S AN AFRICAN AMERICAN TEEN. THE ATTENDED A PARTY IN THE CITY OF POMONA. NUMBER KNOWN TO HIM THERE WAS A GAME OR SEVERAL GANG MEMBERS PRESIDENT THERE WHO HAD A PARTICULAR DISLIKE FOR AFRICAN AMERICANS. IT WAS TARGETED FROM THE MOMENT HE WALKED AND- EVENTUALLY HE WAS CHASED DOWN BEATEN. STABBED THROUGH THE HEART AND SHOT IN THE HEAD. WE PROSECUTED TEN PEOPLE FOR THAT KILLING. SIX WERE CONVICTED OF MURDER. HIS MOTHER ATTENDED FOUR SEPARATE TRIALS COULD COVER ALL OF THE DEFENDANTS. AND AT NO TIME DID SHE EVER WANT TO SEE PICTURES OF COURSE HAN. LAYING IN THE STREET UNCLAD BLEEDING- RECENTLY THE FIRST OF THE CONVICTED- DESCENDANTS BECAME ELIGIBLE FOR PAROLE AFTER JUST ELEVEN YEARS IN CUSTODY AFTER BEING CONVICTED OF SECOND DEGREE MURDER. SHE DID NOT GET NOTICE FROM THE PAROLE BOARD. OUR OFFICE ACTUALLY REACHED OUT TO ME ABOUT A WEEK BEFORE THE HEARING AND BECAUSE I HAD HER NUMBER OF MY CELL PHONE I WAS ABLE TO CONTACT HER. BUT SHE WAS FRANTIC SHE WAS CONFUSION WITH THE WILDER SHE THOUGHT THAT THE DEFENDANT WAS GONNA SERVE AT LEAST FIFTEEN YEARS. AND TO ADD INSULT TO INJURY I HAD TO TELL HER THAT OUR OFFICE WOULD NOT BE PARTICIPATING IN THE PAROLE HEARING. SO IN A VERY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME SHE DID EVERYTHING SHE COULD TO TRY TO PREPARE HERSELF INCLUDING. REQUESTING ALL OF THE POLICE REPORTS AND PHOTOGRAPHS REPORTS FIRST TIME. SHE WENT TO THE PAROLE HEARING- ALONE. IN THE PAROLE BOARD GRANTED PAROLE. SHE WAS DEVASTATED SHE WAS HOSPITALIZED TWICE SHORTLY AFTER THE HEARING SHE FELT THAT THE HEARING WAS UNFAIR. SO AB TWO FOUR ZERO NINE WOULD ADDRESS A COUPLE OF THINGS- MOST IMPORTANTLY IT SUPPORTS TRANSPARENCY IN THE PROCESS. IF THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY OR THE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE PEOPLE REFUSES TO BE PRESENT THEN CERTAINLY- VICTIMS HAVE A RIGHT TO KNOW THAT THE HEARING IS HAPPENING APPLE RIGHT TO BE PRESENT TO PARTICIPATE IF THEY CHOOSE TO. UNDER CURRENT LAW. THERE REALLY IS NO THERE IS NO MANDATE FOR DISTRICT ATTORNEYS TO NOTIFY VICTIMS AND THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY IS IN THE BEST POSITION TO DO IT. IN THE CASE OF MARKIEFF WILL BLOCK AND HIS MOTHER JUST COOKED TODAY ILLUSTRATE THAT. BECAUSE WE WORK SO CLOSELY WITH VICTIMS AND THEIR FAMILIES MANY OF US PROSECUTORS HAVE PERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE VICTIMS. AND EVEN IF THEIR RECORDS BECOME OUTDATED IN OUR FILES OFTENTIMES WE WILL STILL HAVE CON TO CONTACT THEM. I WILL I WILL POINT OUT ONE THING ABOUT MY CURRENT BOSS TO DISTRICT ATTORNEY MISTER GASTON WE ALL KNOW THAT. ARE THE REASON WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THIS NOTICE REQUIREMENT IS BECAUSE OF HIS DECISION TO ABSENT HIMSELF OUR OFFICE FROM THE HEARING. IN HIS WRITTEN DIRECTIVE HE WRITES QUOTE. THIS OFFICE WILL CONTINUE TO MEET ITS OBLIGATION TO NOTIFY IN IT BY THE VICTIMS UNDER CALIFORNIA LAW. IN A COMMITTED TO A PROCESS OF HEALING AND RESTORATIVE JUSTICE FOR ALL CLICK. UNCLE STRUGGLING AGAIN I'M NOT SPEAKING FOR THE DELAY BUT THAT IT'S IN HIS WRITTEN POLICY WHERE IT APPEARED HE ASSUMES THAT CALIFORNIA LAW ALREADY REQUIRES THIS TYPE OF NOTICE- SO DESPITE HIS DECISION NOT TO PARTICIPATE IN NEEDS HEARING IT DOES APPEAR THAT HE SUPPORTS A NOTICE REQUIREMENTS. ALL RIGHT WITHOUT NOTICES NO RIGHT AT ALL AND SO OF ALL THE RESULT STATE TRANSPARENCY RESPECT FOR VICTIMS SUPPORT FOR VICTIMS. UNDERSTANDING THAT. THERE'S NOTHING MORE TRAUMATIZING THAN HEARING AFTER THE FACT. THAT SOMEONE WHO KILLED A CLOSE LOVED ONE IS BEING PAROLED AND YOU DIDN'T EVEN KNOW THAT THE HEARING WAS HAPPENING. I THINK VICTIMS DESERVE THIS NOTICE THEY DESERVE THE RIGHT TO MAKE THE DECISION ABOUT WHETHER TO ATTEND OR NOT. WHETHER WHETHER TO SUBMIT A LETTER OR NOT. THEY DESERVE THE RIGHT TO GATHER OTHER FAMILY AND FRIENDS WHO WILL PARTICIPATE. AND THAT'S ALL THIS IS A VERY MODEST REQUESTS I THINK IT DOVETAILS NICELY WITH A B. EIGHTEEN FORTY SIX WHICH WAS DISCUSSED EARLIER. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU. AND ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT IN THE ROOM. ANY WITNESSES TO SUPPORT ONLINE. TELEPHONE OVER A TELEPHONE LINE WISH TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL PLEASE PRESS ONE ZERO PRESS ONE THERE ARE. MISTER CHAIR NO ONE IS SIGNAL BUT THEY WISH TO SPEAK. GARY ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME'S KEITH WIDELY EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF UNCOMMON LAW- WE REMAIN OPPOSED TO THIS BILL- I HAVE PERSONALLY PARTICIPATED IN HUNDREDS. OF PAROLE HEARINGS- I HAVE PERSONALLY WITNESSED THEM- THIS BILL ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY INVOLVE SURVIVORS OF VIOLENT CRIME I'VE SEEN THEM BE RE TRAUMATIZED BY THIS PROCESS OVER AND OVER AGAIN- AND I'VE I'VE STUDIED THOUSANDS OF HEARING TRANSCRIPTS- AND SEEING THIS DISPLAY A MAY TIMES. AND IMPORTANT PORTENT CLARIFICATION I NEED TO MAKE- YOU KNOW FROM FROM A GOOD DISCUSSION WE HAD EARLIER THIS IS ABOUT- MARSY'S LAW AND- IT ACTUALLY EXPANDS THE DEFINITION OF VICTIMS AND IT'S IMPORTANT WE'RE CLEAR ABOUT THAT PARENTS CHILDREN SIBLINGS GUARDIAN AND A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE PERSON ACTUALLY DIRECTLY HARPER BACKGROUND ALL OF THEM ARE INCLUDED AS DEFINITE BY DEFINITION. AS VICTIMS. AND UNDER THE OTHER BILL WE DISCUSSED EIGHTEEN FORTY SIX EACH ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE COULD HIRE AN ATTORNEY. FOR THE TO SHOP AT A PAROLE HEARING EACH ONE OF THEM. SOME OF THE SUPPORT- THAT THAT- HAS BEEN OFFERED FOR TWENTY FOUR NUYS BASED ON THIS THE ASSERTED NEED TO SUPPORT- VICTIMS AND I CERTAINLY- DON'T HAVE ANY PROBLEM WITH THAT HOWEVER- THIS EFFORT TO- REQUIRE ADDITIONAL NOTICE IT'S DUPLICATIVE BECAUSE- THE BILL IS ASSIGNING THE DA RESPONSIBILITIES ARE ALREADY HELD BY THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS. THEY HAVE ISN'T AN OFFICE OF VICTIMS AND SURVIVORS RIGHTS AND SERVICES THAT'S ALREADY OBLIGATED TO PROVIDE THESE NOTICES- THEY PROVIDE THEM AT LEAST NINETY DAYS BEFORE THE HEARINGS- AND ALL SURVIVORS NEED TO DO IS REGISTER- WITH THE BOARD TO GET THOSE NOTIFICATIONS- MOREOVER JUST LAST YEAR. CCR GOT AN ADDITIONAL ONE POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS TO HIRE ADDITIONAL STAFF TO DO THIS VERY THING. TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL NOTICE- TWO SURVIVORS OF THE CRIMES OF THAT THE PROBE WAS BEING CONSIDERED- THE OTHER POINT I MAKE IS THAT. TWENTY FOUR NINE- I JUST DON'T THINK IT RELEASED SUPPORT SURVIVORS- BECAUSE AS WE INDICATED REQUIRES THE A TO- REACH OUT TO ALL SURVIVORS EVEN IF THEY'VE CHOSEN TO HAVE NOTHING TO DO FURTHER WITH THIS PROCESS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE PERSON WHO CAUSED THEM HARM OR THE CRIME BECAUSE THE MARK- AND IN FACT MOST CRIME SURVIVORS CHOOSE NOT TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PROCESS- I THINK IT'S BECAUSE OF CONCERNS ABOUT TRIGGERING THE PAST HARMS BASS DRUM- AND IT'S A PROCESS THAT PROVIDES NO ACCESS TO HEALING. I THINK THIS CHOICE HAS TO BE RESPECTED- WHAT THIS BILL WOULD DO IS IT WOULD FORCE THEM TO BE A PART OF A HARMFUL PROCESS SOLELY AT THE WHIM. OF PEOPLE WHO WANT TO CAPITALIZE OFF THEIR RAW EMOTION. TO DISTRACT PAROLE COMMISSIONERS FROM THERE NOT JUST THE PRIMARY THIS SOLE RESPONSIBILITY. AS THE CONSIDER SOMEONE'S CURRENT RISK PUBLIC SAFETY- AND SO FOR THAT REASON WE STRONGLY URGE A NO VOTE ON TWENTY FOUR NINE. JAMES GEORGE. THREE SHAPING AMENDMENTS. THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THE AMENDMENTS- AND MARCO GEORGE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION I WOULD ECHO THE COMMENTS THAT MR WILEY SAID- BUT ALSO I WOULD SAY AS SOMEONE WHO HAS BEEN ASSAULTED AND I DON'T THINK THAT BAPTISM COMMON THAT- VERY LARGE PERCENTAGE OF WOMEN IN THE FIVE HAVE BEEN- AB TWENTY FOUR OH NINE. DOES NOT HAVE ANY KIND OF EITHER OFTEN OR OPT OUT OF THE NOTIFICATION PROCESS. AND BECAUSE IT DOESN'T- IT WILL ACTUALLY HARM AND RECALL THE TIME SOME PEOPLE. FOR VICTIMS WHO ELECTED NOT TO BE CONTACTED BE BY CDC. THEY'LL STILL BE CONTACTED BY THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY UNDER THIS BILL FOR VICTIMS WHO WISH TO FORGET. FOR VICTIMS WHO HAVE SOUGHT TO REBUILD THEIR LIVES. FOR VICTIMS WHO HAVE UNDERGONE COUNSELING AND DECIDED TO CLOSE THE DOOR COMPARTMENTALIZE WHAT HAPPENED. THERE'S NO NO WAY FOR THEM IN THIS BILL THE SITE PLEASE DON'T CONTACT ME ANYMORE AND FOR THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY TWO FIVE BY THEIR WISHES FOR THEM FROM THE BEGINNING TO SAY I DON'T WANT TO BE INVOLVED IN THIS PROCESS. SO I RESPECTFULLY ON BEHALF OF C. P. A. ASK FOR YOUR NUMBER. THANK YOU. NOW GO TO THE PHONE THIRTY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. I EIGHTEEN T. OPERATOR COULD OPEN UP BLIND. FOR THOSE WHO WISH TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION PLEASE PRESS ONE THEN ZERO AT THIS TIME PRESS ONE AND ZERO. MISTER CHAIR WE HAVE SEVERAL PEOPLE SIGNALED THAT THEY WISH TO SPEAK ONE MOMENT. WE'LL GO TO LINE TWO SIXTY TWO. HI GOOD AFTERNOON THIS IS GREGORY FIDEL ON BEHALF OF INITIATE JUSTICE AND RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION THANK YOU. ONE TWO SIXTY THREE. JIM WEINBERG- BEHALF OF THE FRIENDS COMMITTEE ON LEGISLATION OF CALIFORNIA ALSO IN OPPOSITION. MISTER CHAIR THERE IS NO ONE ELSE PARDON ME THAT ONE ADDITIONAL. LINE EIGHTY TWO TWO HUNDRED THIRTY UPON RETURNING ON BEHALF OF SOME BREAKING UP WITH HIM ALL AND PROJECT AMIGA IN OPPOSITION THE CHIEF. MISTER CHAIR THERE IS NO ONE ELSE IS SIGNAL BUT THEY WISH TO SPEAK THANK YOU BRING ABOUT TO COMMITTEE FOR ANY QUESTIONS BONTA ANIMUS TO CORK THIS TWO ZERO THE FIRST IS- IF A VICTIM IS ALREADY A CONTACTED AS REQUIRED BY. OVS R. S. WHAT IS THE- PROBLEM THAT WE ARE TRYING TO SOLVE BY ALSO REQUIRING THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY TO. ALSO INITIATE THAT NOTICE AND THEN I JUST AS A PRACTICAL MATTER- FOR THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY- TO RECEIVE THAT NOTICE HOW WOULD IT NEXT OF KIN IN PARTICULAR. THAT NO TO REGISTER OR PARTICIPATE IN THE REGISTRATION PROCESS- AND GIVE THAT TO MISTER MCKINNEY FOR ME. OKAY THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS THAT. AB TWO FOUR OH NINE DID NOT DUPLICATE THE EXISTING NOTICE REQUIREMENT I THINK WHAT NEEDS TO BE UNDERSTOOD ABOUT THE GOOD THING NOTICE REQUIREMENT IS. IT REQUIRED AN OPT IN PROVISION VICTIMS HAVE TO NOTIFY THE BORDER PATROL THAT THEY WISH TO RECEIVE FUTURE NOTICE THE BORDER PATROL THEN SEND AN APPLICATION TO THE VICTIM THAT THEY FILL OUT AND THEN HAVE TO RETURN. SO ALTHOUGH MOST ABOUT IT IF NOT IF DE PROCESS WE KNOW THAT A LOT OF OUR VICTIMS ARE NOT YET SOPHISTICATED. AND ALTHOUGH THEY WANT THE NOTICE ARE NOT IN THE BEST POSITION TO FOLLOW THROUGH WITH THAT PROCESS. AND EVEN IF THEY DO OFTENTIMES THESE HEARINGS WILL COME UP OVER A DECADE AFTER THE REGISTER. WE KNOW THAT WE HAVE POPULATIONS THAT ARE VERY TRANSITORY SO THEY MOVED AROUND A LOT. THEY CHANGED THEIR PHONE NUMBERS ALL. AND ONCE THAT HAPPENED THE BORDER PATROL WILL BE IN A VERY- DISADVANTAGES POSITION TO REACH OUT TO THE- FOLKS. DISTRICT ATTORNEY BUT THAT'S GENERALLY ARE IN THE BEST POSITION TO DO THAT AND THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH THE PROCESS THAT DUPLICATE ABOVE NOTICE THAT'S ALL WE'RE TALKING ABOUT NOBODY'S BEEN CRAFTED INTO PARTICIPATING. IN THE HEARING IT'S JUST NOTICED THAT THE HEARING IS HAPPENING. ARE THERE ALSO BEEN A LOT OF NEW LAW- THAT HAD ME PEOPLE WHO WERE PREVIOUSLY INELIGIBLE FOR PAROLE ELIGIBLE FOR PAROLE. WE'VE GOT A LOT OF NEW LAWS THAT ALLOW CREDITS FOR PEOPLE WHO SERVING TIME FOR MURDER WHERE VICTIMS MAY NOT EXPECT THAT A PAROLE HEARING IS GOING TO HAPPEN. FOURTEEN YEARS AND BECAUSE OF CREDIT THAT ARE BEING- NOW AGAINST A MURDER CONVICTION IN TOTAL HEARING TO HAPPEN NOT HAPPENING A LOT SOONER. AND WITHOUT DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S REACHING OUT TO THEM DALY MAY VERY WELL FIND OUT THAT SOMEBODY IS PAROLED WHEN THEY SEE THEM IN THE SUPERMARKET. WHERE THEY SEE THE MEDIC STATE. AND OUR NO THAT'S NOT WE WANT I DON'T THINK IT'S FAIR MINDED PEOPLE. ONE OTHER QUESTION. JUST A FOLLOW UP I'M NOT REALLY UNDERSTANDING HOW THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY WOULD BE IN ANY BETTER POSITION THAN OVERLY THAN THAT- THE SRS TO- ACTUALLY HAVE ACCESS TO. THAT INFORMATION FROM THAT VICTIMS OR AT THE NEXT OF KIN AFTER TIME DELAY SO FOR THAT REASON I'M GOING TO BE VOTING NO ON THIS. MAGRIS THAT BRIEFLY. I'VE I'VE PROSECUTED FORTY MURDER TRIALS I PROBABLY HAVE THIRTY VICTIMS FAMILIES OF MYSELF ALL. I TALKED TO SOME OF MY VICTIMS NOT ALL FORTY BUT I KEEP UP WITH ABOUT TEN FAMILIES REGULARLY THEY CALLED ME WE TALK ABOUT THINGS YOU KNOW THAT ARE NOT RELATED TO THE CASE. WE HAVE FILES IN OUR FILES WE HAVE NOT ONLY THE VICTIM BUT WE HAVE. OTHER WITNESSES WHO KNOW THE VICTIM WE HAVE. A PLETHORA OF INFORMATION IN OUR FILES THAT WILL ALLOW US TO FIND SOMEONE. EASIER MUCH EASIER THEN THE BORDER PATROL'S. BORDER POLL WOULD HAVE I MEAN ALL THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE THIS AT ONE TIME REGISTRATION INFORMATION- SO YOU KNOW THERE'S REALLY NO PROBLEM WITH THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY. MEETING FOR REASONABLE EFFORTS DISCUSS ALL THIS BILL REQUIRES AND REASONABLE EFFORTS TO REACH OUT AND FIND SOME EXCEPTION. THANK YOU RIGHT OR VISIT PURPOSE TO QUIRK WHO BETTER QUESTION. MISTER CORK- HUMBOLDT LITTLE BIT- CONCERNED THAT. WELL I UNDERSTAND THE CONCERN THAT IF YOU HAVEN'T OPTED IN SOME PEOPLE JUST. YOU KNOW MAY HAVE LOST THAT PIECE PER. TO- THAT PC PER A CONCERN THAT YOU'RE GOING TO BE. REMINDING PEOPLE OF SOMETHING THEY DON'T WANT TO BE REMINDED ABOUT I'M GOING TO SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY BUT I REALLY NEED TO THINK ABOUT THAT. AND I HAVE CONCERNS AND I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING YOU NEED TO THINK ABOUT ALSO IT'S GOING TO GO TO APPROPRIATIONS WHICH- NOW ALL OF US HAVE BILLS TO DIE THERE EVERY YEAR. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR YOU TO GET SOME SORT OF- ESTIMATE FROM THE D. A.'S THAT DOESN'T COME OUT TO BE SEVERAL MILLION DOLLARS TO AFFORD IT. BECAUSE- IT'S SPECIFICALLY SAYS THAT IT MAY BE SOMETHING THE STATE HAS TO REMEMBER SO I THINK YOU NEED TO. TALK TO THE D. A.'S AND GET THEM TO COME UP WITH I HOPE A LOW ESTIMATE FOR THE SAKE OF YOUR BILL. BUT THEN I'M I'M ALSO CONCERNED AGAIN ABOUT PEOPLE BEING REMINDED ABOUT SOMETHING THAT I WANT TO REMIND IT ABOUT AND I'D LIKE YOU TO THINKABOUT THAT- SO RESERVE MY VOTE FOR THE FLOOR BUT I'LL HELP YOU GET IT OUT TODAY. THANK YOU. YES ZERO. THERE'S NOTHING IN THIS BILL THAT- IS STEP HAS SUBPOENA POWER OVER SOMEBODY WHO GETS NOTIFIED THAT THEY HAVE TO GO TO THE PAROLE HEARING SO THEY GET AND PIECE OF PAPER THEY DON'T WANT TO DO IT THEY WRINKLE IT UP TO THROW. THE TRASH. AND THEY'VE DEALT WITH IT. OKAY BECAUSE THAT'S I. I'M I UNDERSTAND. RIGHT BUT I'M JUST SAYING I GET IT DID YOU KNOW SOME OF THE ARGUMENTS SOUND LIKE YOU KNOW PEOPLE ARE COMPELLED TO GO TO THIS AND IT'S GOING TO DREDGE UP MEMORIES- PEOPLE THAT HAVE LEARNED TO COMPARTMENTALIZE AND DEAL WITH THESE THINGS- WILL WILL IF THAT'S WHAT THEY HAVE DONE AND THEY DON'T CARE TO BE NOTIFIED ARE THEY DON'T CARE TO PARTICIPATE- THEY WILLSIMPLY JUST THROW IT AWAY AND NOT PARTICIPATE AND THAT TAKES CARE OF THAT PROBLEM SO I'LL BE SUPPORTING YOUR BILL THANK YOU. THE OTHER. JUST REAL QUICK GREAT YET IT SEEMS LIKE. TO ME THIS BILL IS BASICALLY SUPPORTED BY JUST DECENCY OF BEING ABLE TO- NOTIFY SOMEONE OF THIS LEVEL OF- AND OFFENDER I I'D- I TOOK UMBRAGE WITH THE FACT TO SAY THAT- VICTIMS WOULD ACTUALLY CAPITALIZE OFF OF THEIR SOUL OF MOTION. I MEAN THAT IS INSULTING TO ME. TO KNOW THAT- A LOT OF THESE OFFENSES ARE VERY HEINOUS AND- THE WAY THEY IMPACT VICTIMS JUDGMENT. I MEAN IT'S VERY VERY UNFORTUNATE FOR ALL INVOLVED THAT TO SOME PEOPLE TAKE THESE COURSES OF ACTION BUT IN THE INTEREST OF JUSTICE WE NEED TO RECOGNIZE BOTH THE OFFENDER. AND THE VICTIM AND THIS IS ALL THIS IS ASKING OF THE VICTIMS BE NOTIFIED. THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE DISCUSSION AYE I FIND IT HARD TO BELIEVE THERE'S OPPOSITION BUT I'M I'LL BE SUPPORTING. DO WITH THAT YOU MAY CLOSE EARLY AND I JUST WANNA. TOUCH BASE IN REGARDS TO YEARS ONE OF THE THINGS WITH THE DA THEY HAVE ACCESS TO DMV RECORDS A LITTLE BIT MORE RECORDS THAT THEY CAN FIND IF THEY NEED TO FIND THE PERSON ESPECIALLY IF IT'S SPEND FIVE TEN YEARS SINCE THIS CASE HAPPENED. IN REGARDS TO YOU ON YOUR OBJECTION REGARDS TO- THE OPTING IN OPTING OUT RIGH NOW YOU CAN DO THIS BUT BUT I'D LIKE TO DO IS SIT DOWN WITH YOU AND LET'S CLARIFY THIS TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT THERE. AND WE COULD DO THAT APPROPRIATIONS BECAUSE THAT SEEMS TO BE THE BIGGEST THING IS HAVING THEM HAVE TO DEAL WITH TRAUMA AGAIN SO IF IT'S NOT BEING CLARIFIED THERE THEN WE CAN GO AHEAD IN MAY BE RESTRUCTURED SO IT'S VERY CLEAR THAT THEY HAVE A CHANCE RIGHT THERE. TO OPT IN OR OPT OUT TO HERE AND I THINK THAT WOULD SELL PROBABLY WHAT YOUR CONCERNS ARE. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR NIGHT THANK YOU- FOR. A JOB BROUGH. WE WERE GONNA MMHM HOPEFULLY MOVED ASIDE BUT I WILL PUT. I URGE YOU TO LISTEN TO WHAT WITH SOME OF THE MEMBERS HAVE SAID REALLY WELL ACTUALLY MR CORK IN RESPONSE TO A WIDER IT COULD BE FIXED DREAMY DIFFICULT NOT ONLY TO GET OUT OF. ROPES BUT- JUST GETTING OFF THE FLOOR- AND I LIKE MR CORKER WROTE. BROUGH FOR TO HELP YOU GET OUT OF IT BUT UNDERSTAND. IF CERTAIN THINGS AREN'T RESULT WOULD BE VERY. DIFFICULT FOR US TO A TO VOTE FOR IT AGAIN I'D BE HAPPY TO SIT DOWN WITH BOTH OF THEM. THANK YOU.
