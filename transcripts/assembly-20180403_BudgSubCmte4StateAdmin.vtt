00:37:51.035 --> 00:37:55.373 region:rollup2
IN THIS CASE WE WOULD SEPARATE

FUNDS ARE HARD WHEN WE EXPECT TO

00:38:28.339 --> 00:38:30.975 region:rollup2
AND THEN WE WOULD PULL THE

PERCENT.

00:39:31.135 --> 00:39:33.538 region:rollup2
BUT ACCOUNTING FOR THE UNFUNDED

00:39:32.604 --> 00:39:34.072 region:rollup2
NO PLACE LIKE HOME POSITIONS THE

MONTHLY AVERAGE WAS SIXTEEN

00:39:36.941 --> 00:39:39.577 region:rollup2
POINT FOUR PERCENT.

00:39:38.042 --> 00:39:40.578 region:rollup2
BUT ACCOUNTING AGAIN FOR THOSE

00:39:39.577 --> 00:39:41.579 region:rollup2
NO PLACE LIKE HOME POSITIONS THE

00:39:40.578 --> 00:39:43.548 region:rollup2

PERCENT.

00:39:43.548 --> 00:39:45.883 region:rollup2
SO WHAT'S YOUR PLAN TO BRING ON

00:39:44.549 --> 00:39:46.885 region:rollup2
BOARD IT WILL STAFF POSITIONS

00:39:45.883 --> 00:39:49.220 region:rollup2
FOR EIGHTEEN NINETEEN.

00:39:46.885 --> 00:39:51.122 region:rollup2
OUR PLAN IS TO HIRE IN WAVES

00:39:49.220 --> 00:39:52.290 region:rollup2
FIRST FOCUSING ON THE SP TWO

00:39:51.122 --> 00:39:53.958 region:rollup2
POSITIONS.

00:39:52.290 --> 00:39:55.560 region:rollup2
WE'VE DEVELOPED A PROJECT

00:39:53.958 --> 00:39:57.829 region:rollup2
PLANNER WE'RE IN THE PROCESS OF

00:39:55.560 --> 00:39:59.297 region:rollup2
I'VE HAD. REFINING OUR PROJECT

00:39:57.829 --> 00:40:01.099 region:rollup2
PLAN FOR MANAGING THE EFFORT AS

00:39:59.297 --> 00:40:03.468 region:rollup2
ACROSS ORGANIZATIONAL PROJECT

00:40:01.099 --> 00:40:04.702 region:rollup2
FOR THE DEPARTMENT.

00:40:03.468 --> 00:40:06.537 region:rollup2
AND AYE WERE APPROACHING IT

00:40:04.702 --> 00:40:08.206 region:rollup2
STRATEGICALLY SO THAT WERE

00:40:06.537 --> 00:40:09.574 region:rollup2
PLANNING THAT THAT WILL ON BOARD

00:40:08.206 --> 00:40:11.309 region:rollup2
POSITIONS AND PEOPLE IN A WAY

00:40:09.574 --> 00:40:13.311 region:rollup2
THAT WILL SUPPORT. THE

00:40:11.309 --> 00:40:15.013 region:rollup2
ONBOARDING ACTIVITIES AS WELL AS

00:40:13.311 --> 00:40:16.981 region:rollup2
THE ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGE FOR

00:40:15.013 --> 00:40:19.651 region:rollup2
THE DEPARTMENT SO THAT FIRST

00:40:16.981 --> 00:40:22.253 region:rollup2
WAVE WOULD BE WHAT TIME PERIOD.

00:40:19.651 --> 00:40:23.821 region:rollup2
AND WHAT IS FAR AS NUMBERS GO.

00:40:22.253 --> 00:40:26.190 region:rollup2
THE FIRST WAVE I THINK THAT I

00:40:23.821 --> 00:40:27.392 region:rollup2
HAD BETWEEN SP TWO AND AND

00:40:26.190 --> 00:40:29.794 region:rollup2
IRVINE RATHER THE SP THREE

00:40:27.392 --> 00:40:30.995 region:rollup2
POSITIONS AS APPROXIMATELY HALF

00:40:29.794 --> 00:40:32.964 region:rollup2
OF THE EIGHTY ONE POSITIONS

00:40:30.995 --> 00:40:34.232 region:rollup2
REQUESTED IN THE NEXT FISCAL

00:40:32.964 --> 00:40:35.600 region:rollup2
YEAR.

00:40:34.232 --> 00:40:37.602 region:rollup2
SO WE'D FIRST BEFORE KISSING ON

00:40:35.600 --> 00:40:38.169 region:rollup2
THE OTHER HALF OF POSITIONS

00:40:37.602 --> 00:40:40.638 region:rollup2
WITHIN THE FIRST HALF OF THE

00:40:38.169 --> 00:40:41.239 region:rollup2
FISCAL YEAR.

00:40:40.638 --> 00:40:43.107 region:rollup2
OKAY SO JUST BASICALLY TO WAVE

00:40:41.239 --> 00:40:45.310 region:rollup2
THEN.

00:40:43.107 --> 00:40:47.245 region:rollup2
YES ALTHOUGH I THINK THE NUANCES

00:40:45.310 --> 00:40:50.982 region:rollup2
THAT THERE MAY BE A LEADER WAVE

00:40:47.245 --> 00:40:52.283 region:rollup2
OF FOR S. B. THREE. I'VE HAD.

00:40:50.982 --> 00:40:54.485 region:rollup2
THAT THE RECRUITMENT WOULD BEGIN

WITHIN THIS COMING FISCAL YEAR.

00:40:54.485 --> 00:40:57.322 region:rollup2
BUT WOULD BE CONCLUDED MOVING

00:40:56.788 --> 00:41:00.591 region:rollup2
INTO THE NEXT FISCAL YEAR

WITH RENTAL ASSISTANCE BUT I

00:42:53.371 --> 00:42:56.140 region:rollup2
THINK WE ALL KNOW THAT. WE NEED

00:42:54.772 --> 00:42:57.575 region:rollup2

00:43:13.257 --> 00:43:17.095 region:rollup2
ADDRESSING SHORT TERM

00:43:14.459 --> 00:43:18.896 region:rollup2
HOMELESSNESS DO YOU HAVE. DATA

FOR DATA PROJECT PERSPECTIVE BUT

00:44:01.973 --> 00:44:04.742 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY WE WANT TO BUILD A TO

00:44:03.007 --> 00:44:06.210 region:rollup2
THIS SOME EXPECTATION THAT WE

00:44:04.742 --> 00:44:07.945 region:rollup2
SEE?

00:44:06.210 --> 00:44:08.946 region:rollup2

WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE.

00:44:29.233 --> 00:44:31.235 region:rollup2
I THINK YOU KNOW WE DON'T REALLY

00:44:29.901 --> 00:44:32.770 region:rollup2
HAVE THE ABILITY TO.

00:44:31.235 --> 00:44:34.805 region:rollup2

KNOW SOMETHING THAT OUR WHOLE

00:44:37.208 --> 00:44:39.510 region:rollup2
ACCORDING TO FIND TO COUNSEL'S

00:44:38.309 --> 00:44:40.478 region:rollup2
NEED A PRIORITY OF.

00:44:39.510 --> 00:44:41.145 region:rollup2
WE CERTAINLY HAVE BEGUN TO LOOK

00:44:40.478 --> 00:44:42.880 region:rollup2
INTO BUT OF COURSE WE DON'T HAVE

00:44:41.145 --> 00:44:43.614 region:rollup2
A STATE LEVEL SYSTEM THAT WE

00:44:42.880 --> 00:44:44.715 region:rollup2
WOULD LIKE IN TERMS OF THE

00:44:43.614 --> 00:44:45.750 region:rollup2
CAPABLE YOU'RE GETTING AT.

00:44:44.715 --> 00:44:47.718 region:rollup2
TO REALLY DO THE GREAT

00:44:45.750 --> 00:44:48.252 region:rollup2
EVALUATION I THINK THAT'S NEED

00:44:47.718 --> 00:44:49.787 region:rollup2
TO MAKE MORE MORE INFORMED

00:44:48.252 --> 00:44:51.088 region:rollup2
DECISIONS.

00:44:49.787 --> 00:44:52.390 region:rollup2
BUT WE DO RECOGNIZE I THINK THIS

00:44:51.088 --> 00:44:53.891 region:rollup2
DIFFERENCE NEED OF SERVING FOLKS

00:44:52.390 --> 00:44:54.725 region:rollup2
NOW AND SO THAT'S WHY YOU HEAR

00:44:53.891 --> 00:44:56.227 region:rollup2
THE THE MENU OF THINGS.

00:44:54.725 --> 00:44:59.063 region:rollup2
I THINK GET GOOD AT THAT BUT

00:44:56.227 --> 00:45:00.031 region:rollup2
ALSO WITH THE AYE ON GETTING A

00:44:59.063 --> 00:45:00.965 region:rollup2
CHRONICLE ASSISTANCE IN THIS

00:45:00.031 --> 00:45:04.368 region:rollup2
LONG TERM SOLUTIONS THAT WE TALK

00:45:00.965 --> 00:45:06.204 region:rollup2
ABOUT. YOU LOCAL HOUSING SUBSIDY

00:45:04.368 --> 00:45:06.771 region:rollup2
APPLICABLE SUBSEA POOLS OR WHAT

00:45:06.204 --> 00:45:07.605 region:rollup2
DOES ACTUALLY THAT LEVERAGE

00:45:06.771 --> 00:45:09.307 region:rollup2
OTHER FUNDING THAT CAN BE USED

00:45:07.605 --> 00:45:10.775 region:rollup2
TO AUGMENT OR SUPPLEMENT

00:45:09.307 --> 00:45:11.976 region:rollup2
SUPPORTIVE HOUSING I THINK WOULD

00:45:10.775 --> 00:45:12.577 region:rollup2
REALLY LIKE TO SEE. COMMUNITIES

00:45:11.976 --> 00:45:14.979 region:rollup2
OMICS OF THOSE CHOICES BUT.

00:45:12.577 --> 00:45:17.148 region:rollup2
BUT WE ALSO UNDERSTAND THE NEED

00:45:14.979 --> 00:45:17.748 region:rollup2
TO ADDRESS A WHOLE CONTINUUM OF

00:45:17.148 --> 00:45:20.284 region:rollup2
ELICITED FROM FOR SHELTER DEL

00:45:17.748 --> 00:45:21.319 region:rollup2
ON%

00:45:20.284 --> 00:45:22.019 region:rollup2
TO PERMANENT POSITION CREATED

00:45:21.319 --> 00:45:22.653 region:rollup2
YOUR ANSWER ON THAT AND AND

00:45:22.019 --> 00:45:23.287 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY FROM MY PERSPECTIVE I

00:45:22.653 --> 00:45:24.622 region:rollup2
THINK ANYTHING YOU CAN DO TO

00:45:23.287 --> 00:45:25.323 region:rollup2
COLLECT MORE DATA. SOONER THAN

00:45:24.622 --> 00:45:25.990 region:rollup2
LATER IS AS HELPFUL.

00:45:25.323 --> 00:45:27.158 region:rollup2
YOU MAY KNOW THAT I HAVE A BILL

00:45:25.990 --> 00:45:29.393 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD.

00:45:27.158 --> 00:45:30.561 region:rollup2
IT WOULD TO ASK EACH CD TO

00:45:29.393 --> 00:45:31.829 region:rollup2
START COLLECTING LOCAL DATA SO

00:45:30.561 --> 00:45:32.463 region:rollup2
THAT WE HAVE A BIGGER PICTURE OF

00:45:31.829 --> 00:45:33.030 region:rollup2
OF EXACTLY WHAT'S GOING ON IN

00:45:32.463 --> 00:45:37.368 region:rollup2
OUR. FUNDS CAN BE BEST USED

00:45:33.030 --> 00:45:38.302 region:rollup2
PUMP.

00:45:37.368 --> 00:45:39.370 region:rollup2
A DIFFERENT QUESTION I HAD WE

00:45:38.302 --> 00:45:40.705 region:rollup2
ALL SHARE THE GOAL OF WANTING TO

00:45:39.370 --> 00:45:41.305 region:rollup2
GET MONIES OUT TO OUR LOCALITIES

00:45:40.705 --> 00:45:41.772 region:rollup2
AS AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE TO

00:45:41.305 --> 00:45:42.373 region:rollup2
GIVE THEM. FLEXIBILITY

00:45:41.772 --> 00:45:45.042 region:rollup2
ANDADDRESSING THE CRISES THAT

00:45:42.373 --> 00:45:46.510 region:rollup2
ARE

00:45:45.042 --> 00:45:48.112 region:rollup2
HAPPENING ON THE STREETS OF OF

00:45:46.510 --> 00:45:49.380 region:rollup2
CITIES AND COUNTIES. OF BUT I

00:45:48.112 --> 00:45:51.449 region:rollup2
THINK THERE'S A BALANCE BETWEEN

00:45:49.380 --> 00:45:53.818 region:rollup2
WANTING TO GET MONEY OUT. TO

00:45:51.449 --> 00:45:55.419 region:rollup2
LOCALS TO BE USED AS A SEE FIT.

00:45:53.818 --> 00:45:56.053 region:rollup2
VERSES WANTING TO MAKE SURE THAT

00:45:55.419 --> 00:45:57.188 region:rollup2
THE MONIES ARE WELL SPENT AND

00:45:56.053 --> 00:45:59.256 region:rollup2
I'M WONDERING HOW DO YOU PLAN TO

00:45:57.188 --> 00:46:00.224 region:rollup2
BALANCE THOSE NEEDS IF THEY'RE

00:45:59.256 --> 00:46:01.559 region:rollup2
CITIES TO. ONE IT'S BEEN MONIES

00:46:00.224 --> 00:46:03.194 region:rollup2
IN CERTAIN WAYS BETTER ONLY

00:46:01.559 --> 00:46:04.762 region:rollup2
ADDRESSING PARTS OF THE ISSUE

00:46:03.194 --> 00:46:07.265 region:rollup2
HOW THE BALANCE FLEXIBILITY WITH

00:46:04.762 --> 00:46:08.699 region:rollup2
MAKING SURE THAT THERE'S ACTUAL

00:46:07.265 --> 00:46:09.767 region:rollup2
OUTCOME SAID THAT WORK FOR US.

00:46:08.699 --> 00:46:10.434 region:rollup2
YEAH I MEAN I THINK I THINK

00:46:09.767 --> 00:46:11.402 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY WE'RE GONNA GO UP THE

00:46:10.434 --> 00:46:12.069 region:rollup2
PUBLIC COMMENT EXPLORE SOME

00:46:11.402 --> 00:46:13.771 region:rollup2
THESE QUESTIONS ON

00:46:12.069 --> 00:46:14.739 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTABILITY LIKE HOW HOW MUCH

00:46:13.771 --> 00:46:17.141 region:rollup2
CAN WE.

00:46:14.739 --> 00:46:18.142 region:rollup2
DEMAND OF OF RECIPIENTS

00:46:17.141 --> 00:46:18.743 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE IF YOU'RE

00:46:18.142 --> 00:46:19.877 region:rollup2
GOING TO CUT MORE BLOCK GRANT

00:46:18.743 --> 00:46:22.246 region:rollup2
MODEL.

00:46:19.877 --> 00:46:22.446 region:rollup2
HOW FAR CAN WE PUSH ON SOME OF

00:46:22.246 --> 00:46:23.347 region:rollup2
THOSE?

00:46:22.446 --> 00:46:25.283 region:rollup2
?

00:46:23.347 --> 00:46:26.217 region:rollup2
SO I DON'T HAVE THE ANSWER TODAY

00:46:25.283 --> 00:46:27.118 region:rollup2
RIGHT BECAUSE I THINK WE WE

00:46:26.217 --> 00:46:28.686 region:rollup2
ANTICIPATE THAT'S GOING TO BE A

00:46:27.118 --> 00:46:30.554 region:rollup2
MAJOR MAJOR POINT OF KIND OF

00:46:28.686 --> 00:46:31.389 region:rollup2
DISCUSSION AND AS WE DO

00:46:30.554 --> 00:46:33.457 region:rollup2
WORKSHOPS ON THE DRAFT

00:46:31.389 --> 00:46:35.426 region:rollup2
GUIDELINES ARE ENCRYPTED BACK

00:46:33.457 --> 00:46:36.160 region:rollup2
FROM MULTIPLE LITTLE PARTIES.

00:46:35.426 --> 00:46:36.794 region:rollup2
BUT I REST ASSURED IT'S

00:46:36.160 --> 00:46:38.529 region:rollup2
SOMETHING WE'VE DONE A LOT OF

00:46:36.794 --> 00:46:39.630 region:rollup2
INTERNAL DISCUSSION ABOUT ABOUT

00:46:38.529 --> 00:46:41.732 region:rollup2
HOW DO WE HAVE THAT APPROPRIATE

00:46:39.630 --> 00:46:42.333 region:rollup2
CAN ABILITY AND CAN GET THAT OUT

00:46:41.732 --> 00:46:44.402 region:rollup2
OF PEACE.

00:46:42.333 --> 00:46:45.369 region:rollup2
NOT TO SAY YOU KNOW WE DON'T

00:46:44.402 --> 00:46:46.704 region:rollup2
SEE THAT THERE'S ONLY CERTAIN

00:46:45.369 --> 00:46:47.972 region:rollup2
THINGS THAT CAN BE DONE I THINK

00:46:46.704 --> 00:46:49.407 region:rollup2
SOME THE CRITICISM CRITICISM

00:46:47.972 --> 00:46:50.441 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY IN THE PAST AS WE WERE

00:46:49.407 --> 00:46:51.309 region:rollup2
MAYBE OVERLY PRESCRIPTIVE AND

00:46:50.441 --> 00:46:53.678 region:rollup2
HOW MUCH MONEY HAD TO BE SO

00:46:51.309 --> 00:46:54.312 region:rollup2
UNCERTAIN THINGS. WE WANTED TO

00:46:53.678 --> 00:46:55.313 region:rollup2
MAKE SURE WE HEARD SOME OF THAT

00:46:54.312 --> 00:46:55.980 region:rollup2
TOO.

00:46:55.313 --> 00:46:57.648 region:rollup2
BUT.

00:46:55.980 --> 00:47:00.518 region:rollup2
BUT CERTAINLY SURE THAT GOAL ON

00:46:57.648 --> 00:47:01.752 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTABILITY ABSOLUTELY.

00:47:00.518 --> 00:47:02.253 region:rollup2
YEAH WELL SAMIR DID NOT MENTION

00:47:01.752 --> 00:47:03.421 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW.

00:47:02.253 --> 00:47:04.288 region:rollup2
SOME OTHER THINGS WE HAVE BUT

00:47:03.421 --> 00:47:05.556 region:rollup2
WE WE WE DO WE DO ACKNOWLEDGE

00:47:04.288 --> 00:47:06.557 region:rollup2
THAT WE HAVE SOME OF THE FORCES

00:47:05.556 --> 00:47:07.491 region:rollup2
ON THE CAPITAL SIDE FOR PERMITS

00:47:06.557 --> 00:47:08.459 region:rollup2
FOR OF HOUSING.

00:47:07.491 --> 00:47:11.128 region:rollup2
STILL ABLE TO BE DEPLOYED FROM

00:47:08.459 --> 00:47:11.729 region:rollup2
THE DEPARTMENT SO WE TOOK THAT

00:47:11.128 --> 00:47:12.763 region:rollup2
INTO ACCOUNT AS WELL IN TERMS

00:47:11.729 --> 00:47:13.397 region:rollup2
OF.

00:47:12.763 --> 00:47:13.998 region:rollup2
THE FUNDS WE MAY BE ABLE TO

00:47:13.397 --> 00:47:15.266 region:rollup2
STILL THE POINT FOR OUR MULTI

00:47:13.998 --> 00:47:18.102 region:rollup2
FAMILY HOUSING PROGRAM FOR

00:47:15.266 --> 00:47:20.071 region:rollup2
SUPPORTIVE HOUSING OR HOPEFULLY

00:47:18.102 --> 00:47:22.406 region:rollup2
WHEN I YOU KNOW POLITICAL FUNDS

00:47:20.071 --> 00:47:24.175 region:rollup2
ARE UNLOCKED. AYE WE ALSO COURSE

00:47:22.406 --> 00:47:26.377 region:rollup2
HAVE A BETTER NEEDS A HOUSING

00:47:24.175 --> 00:47:27.745 region:rollup2
HOMES PREVENTION PROGRAM WHICH

00:47:26.377 --> 00:47:28.412 region:rollup2
IS UP THE VETERANS FOCUS BUT

00:47:27.745 --> 00:47:29.613 region:rollup2
RIGHT FOR SUPPORT HOUSING SO WE

00:47:28.412 --> 00:47:30.614 region:rollup2
WERE NOT MINDFUL THAT WE HAD A

00:47:29.613 --> 00:47:31.482 region:rollup2
LOT OF POTENTIAL WRITTEN

00:47:30.614 --> 00:47:32.149 region:rollup2
RESOURCES OUT THERE. ON THE

00:47:31.482 --> 00:47:33.918 region:rollup2
CAPITAL SIDE WE THOUGHT HOW CAN

00:47:32.149 --> 00:47:34.919 region:rollup2
WE SUPPORT THAT AND AUGMENT THAT

00:47:33.918 --> 00:47:36.053 region:rollup2
HELP THOSE HAPPEN QUICKER BUT BE

00:47:34.919 --> 00:47:38.456 region:rollup2
MINDFUL THAT WE ARE GOING TO

00:47:36.053 --> 00:47:40.324 region:rollup2
HAVE A LOT OF CAPITAL IN THE

00:47:38.456 --> 00:47:42.259 region:rollup2
STREET. AND.

00:47:40.324 --> 00:47:43.194 region:rollup2
B. THREE PASSES EVEN MORE.

00:47:42.259 --> 00:47:44.095 region:rollup2
GREAT FANDOM AND I APPRECIATE

00:47:43.194 --> 00:47:45.129 region:rollup2
THE FACT THAT YOU'RE GONNA BE

00:47:44.095 --> 00:47:46.097 region:rollup2
PUTTING THE MONEY OUT IN WAVES.

00:47:45.129 --> 00:47:47.631 region:rollup2
AND GET OUT SOME MONEY EARLY AND

00:47:46.097 --> 00:47:48.899 region:rollup2
THEN WAIT FOR THE FEDERAL MONEY

00:47:47.631 --> 00:47:51.135 region:rollup2
TO COME DOWN BEFORE.

00:47:48.899 --> 00:47:52.703 region:rollup2
PUTTING THAT OUT HOW MUCH OF

00:47:51.135 --> 00:47:53.971 region:rollup2
THE STATE USED THE FUNDING HAS

00:47:52.703 --> 00:47:55.473 region:rollup2
ALREADY GONE OUT THIS YEAR.

00:47:53.971 --> 00:47:57.174 region:rollup2
.

00:47:55.473 --> 00:47:58.843 region:rollup2
TO DATE AND THEN WILL GO OUT OF

00:47:57.174 --> 00:48:00.711 region:rollup2
THE NEXT FEW MONTHS LIKE GIVE US

00:47:58.843 --> 00:48:02.480 region:rollup2
A SENSE OF IT THIS YEAR'S AND WE

00:48:00.711 --> 00:48:04.315 region:rollup2
HAVEN'T DONE A FOR THIS YEAR WE

00:48:02.480 --> 00:48:05.282 region:rollup2
WOULD BE W. B. BLOCK MONTH BOOK

00:48:04.315 --> 00:48:06.984 region:rollup2
IT WE WE WE DID ABOUT A THIRD OF

00:48:05.282 --> 00:48:08.152 region:rollup2
THE FUNDING ALREADY OF OUR.

00:48:06.984 --> 00:48:09.553 region:rollup2
STATE EST FUNNY SO INITIALLY WE

00:48:08.152 --> 00:48:10.988 region:rollup2
HAD ABOUT THIRTY FIVE THIRTY SIX

00:48:09.553 --> 00:48:12.289 region:rollup2
MILLION OFFER CC SO WE HAVE A

00:48:10.988 --> 00:48:13.424 region:rollup2
TWENTY FIVE MILLION MEETING IN

00:48:12.289 --> 00:48:15.960 region:rollup2
THE REASON WHY WE ARE SO SORRY

00:48:13.424 --> 00:48:17.228 region:rollup2
SINCE YOUR PROPERTY THIRTY FIVE

00:48:15.960 --> 00:48:18.229 region:rollup2
WE WERE BUT AT THE SIGHT SENT

00:48:17.228 --> 00:48:20.264 region:rollup2
TWENTY FIVE OUT OF TWENTY FIVE.

00:48:18.229 --> 00:48:21.232 region:rollup2
STILL REMAINS FROM THAT AND THE

00:48:20.264 --> 00:48:24.001 region:rollup2
REASON WHY THAT THIS IS IT ME IS

00:48:21.232 --> 00:48:25.269 region:rollup2
IT EARLY ON OTHERS ALSO SHIFT

00:48:24.001 --> 00:48:30.207 region:rollup2
FOR THOSE FOR THE FOR THOSE

00:48:25.269 --> 00:48:32.209 region:rollup2
GRANTEES SO THEY NEED A KIND OF

00:48:30.207 --> 00:48:34.278 region:rollup2
A RAMPING UP SO TO SPEAK.

00:48:32.209 --> 00:48:35.846 region:rollup2
AND THAT WAS WHY WAS BETTER

00:48:34.278 --> 00:48:36.447 region:rollup2
THIRD DOWN IN THE FIRST ROUND

00:48:35.846 --> 00:48:38.382 region:rollup2
AND THEN THEY GET TO SPEECH

00:48:36.447 --> 00:48:39.917 region:rollup2
WASN'T DO THE REMAINDER. THIS

00:48:38.382 --> 00:48:41.552 region:rollup2
YEAR AND NOW IT DOES OF COURSE

00:48:39.917 --> 00:48:44.722 region:rollup2
BEFORE S. B. TWO WITHIN THE NEXT

00:48:41.552 --> 00:48:45.356 region:rollup2
IT'S ANOTHER THREE TO THE NEXT

00:48:44.722 --> 00:48:46.924 region:rollup2
WE JUST THINK THEY'RE COMMITTING

00:48:45.356 --> 00:48:47.758 region:rollup2
CONDOMS OF SKILL. BUT PUTTING

00:48:46.924 --> 00:48:49.160 region:rollup2
THEM ALL TOGETHER FOR SOME

00:48:47.758 --> 00:48:52.263 region:rollup2
EXPANDED USES COUNTER JUSTIN

THE CAREER THE BUDGET YEAR.

00:49:34.672 --> 00:49:38.742 region:rollup2
OKAY. STARTED RICHARD NORRIS UP

00:49:37.741 --> 00:49:40.644 region:rollup2
IN ARE YOU IS THERE ANY PLAN TO

00:49:38.742 --> 00:49:41.679 region:rollup2
DISTRIBUTE MONEY REGIONALLY.

00:49:40.644 --> 00:49:42.746 region:rollup2
SO THAT.

00:49:41.679 --> 00:49:44.982 region:rollup2
REGIONS OF THE STATE CAN

00:49:42.746 --> 00:49:46.917 region:rollup2
COORDINATE HOW TO BEST ADDRESS

00:49:44.982 --> 00:49:47.451 region:rollup2
HOMELESS CRISES AS OPPOSED TO

00:49:46.917 --> 00:49:48.385 region:rollup2
CITY BY CITY OR COUNTY BY

00:49:47.451 --> 00:49:48.752 region:rollup2
COUNTY.

00:49:48.385 --> 00:49:51.488 region:rollup2
SURE.

00:49:48.752 --> 00:49:52.456 region:rollup2
WELL WE ARE PROPOSING TO DO IT

00:49:51.488 --> 00:49:54.925 region:rollup2
THROUGH TO THE EXISTING PROCESS

00:49:52.456 --> 00:49:55.526 region:rollup2
WAS GO TO CONTINUES OF CARE IN

00:49:54.925 --> 00:49:56.327 region:rollup2
ORDER FOR THE COTTONY BECAUSE

00:49:55.526 --> 00:49:57.728 region:rollup2
THOSE THE ENTITIES THAT RECEIVE

00:49:56.327 --> 00:49:58.996 region:rollup2
ALL THE FEDERAL FUNDING AS WELL.

00:49:57.728 --> 00:50:01.398 region:rollup2
UNTIL IT VARIES SOME COULD USE A

00:49:58.996 --> 00:50:02.466 region:rollup2
CARE ARE MULTI COUNTY IN FACT NO

00:50:01.398 --> 00:50:03.367 region:rollup2
ONE IS SEVEN COUNTIES UP IN THE

00:50:02.466 --> 00:50:04.969 region:rollup2
NORTHERN PART OF STATE RIGHT

00:50:03.367 --> 00:50:05.569 region:rollup2
THERE ARE SOME. THERE ARE SOME

00:50:04.969 --> 00:50:07.238 region:rollup2
ITS IT.

00:50:05.569 --> 00:50:08.205 region:rollup2
THERE ARE SOME COLLABORATIONS

00:50:07.238 --> 00:50:09.940 region:rollup2
ON THAT LEVEL.

00:50:08.205 --> 00:50:12.343 region:rollup2
THE NICE PART ABOUT THAT IS

00:50:09.940 --> 00:50:13.244 region:rollup2
THAT'S A TYPICALLY WHERE CITIES

00:50:12.343 --> 00:50:14.512 region:rollup2
AND COUNTIES ARE BOTH ENGAGED TO

00:50:13.244 --> 00:50:15.679 region:rollup2
THE POST IS ONE OF THE SECURE

00:50:14.512 --> 00:50:16.080 region:rollup2
THE COUNTY. RECEIVING THE

00:50:15.679 --> 00:50:18.082 region:rollup2
FUNDING.

00:50:16.080 --> 00:50:18.515 region:rollup2
BUT THEY DO VARY IN TERMS OF

00:50:18.082 --> 00:50:22.186 region:rollup2
THEIR.

00:50:18.515 --> 00:50:22.453 region:rollup2
TO YOUR GRAPHIC COVERAGE TO

00:50:22.186 --> 00:50:23.087 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY.

00:50:22.453 --> 00:50:24.054 region:rollup2
.

00:50:23.087 --> 00:50:25.256 region:rollup2
I DON'T KNOW THAT WE HAVE

00:50:24.054 --> 00:50:25.823 region:rollup2
ANYTHING IN THE WAY WE'VE

00:50:25.256 --> 00:50:27.458 region:rollup2
WITHOUT WHAT IF YOU DO THAT

00:50:25.823 --> 00:50:29.793 region:rollup2
WOULD PRECLUDE. YOU KNOW IT MORE

00:50:27.458 --> 00:50:30.427 region:rollup2
REGIONAL APPROACHES BUT THE

00:50:29.793 --> 00:50:31.262 region:rollup2
FACTS ARE AND SOME WE CAN THINK

00:50:30.427 --> 00:50:32.363 region:rollup2
ABOUT AS WE.

00:50:31.262 --> 00:50:32.997 region:rollup2
GET TO THE FINAL CUT THE

00:50:32.363 --> 00:50:33.864 region:rollup2
GUIDELINES MIGHT BE INTERESTING

00:50:32.997 --> 00:50:35.466 region:rollup2
IT'S A PUBLIC COMMENT ON THAT

00:50:33.864 --> 00:50:37.101 region:rollup2
YET BUT I THINK WE ALL

00:50:35.466 --> 00:50:38.802 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND THAT. HOMELESSNESS

00:50:37.101 --> 00:50:40.704 region:rollup2
DOESN'T ASSERTED STAY IN A CITY

00:50:38.802 --> 00:50:42.907 region:rollup2
OR A COUNTY AND GETTING WE JUST

00:50:40.704 --> 00:50:45.776 region:rollup2
TO WORK WITH EACH OTHER TO COURT

00:50:42.907 --> 00:50:46.443 region:rollup2
A RESOURCES.

00:50:45.776 --> 00:50:48.946 region:rollup2
BOB MIGHT MAKE SOME SENATE WE

00:50:46.443 --> 00:50:50.681 region:rollup2
HAVE ALLOWED IN THE PASS.

00:50:48.946 --> 00:50:51.982 region:rollup2
IF THE PREVIOUS DURATIONS FOR

00:50:50.681 --> 00:50:53.250 region:rollup2
CONTINUE TO CARE TO CUT A JOIN

00:50:51.982 --> 00:50:53.817 region:rollup2
UP THERE FUNDS IF THEY DECIDED

00:50:53.250 --> 00:50:54.818 region:rollup2
TO DO SO I THINK WE ONLY HAD

00:50:53.817 --> 00:50:56.787 region:rollup2
ONE.

00:50:54.818 --> 00:50:57.688 region:rollup2
OR TWO XR TWO TWO TWO POTENTIAL

00:50:56.787 --> 00:50:59.456 region:rollup2
DOT GREAT HE'S GOING UP TO DO

00:50:57.688 --> 00:51:00.491 region:rollup2
THAT WE PROVIDED THAT OPTION WE

00:50:59.456 --> 00:51:02.192 region:rollup2
HAVE PROVIDED THAT'S AN OPTION I

00:51:00.491 --> 00:51:03.127 region:rollup2
M. TWO FINAL QUESTIONS SO. AT

00:51:02.192 --> 00:51:05.129 region:rollup2
THIS MOMENT THE REALLY. THERE

00:51:03.127 --> 00:51:06.964 region:rollup2
ANY STATE PROGRAMS TO EXIST THAT

00:51:05.129 --> 00:51:08.332 region:rollup2
EXISTS TO ADDRESS CHRONIC

00:51:06.964 --> 00:51:09.099 region:rollup2
HOMELESSNESS.

00:51:08.332 --> 00:51:09.633 region:rollup2
THAT.

00:51:09.099 --> 00:51:10.668 region:rollup2
WE CAN GET UP AND RUNNING

00:51:09.633 --> 00:51:11.902 region:rollup2
QUICKLY

00:51:10.668 --> 00:51:12.469 region:rollup2
AT THIS POINT MY UNDERSTANDING

00:51:11.902 --> 00:51:14.705 region:rollup2
IS WE REALLY DON'T HAVE THAT

00:51:12.469 --> 00:51:16.507 region:rollup2
RIGHT.

00:51:14.705 --> 00:51:18.008 region:rollup2
WE'D WE CERTAINLY HAVE A NAY.

00:51:16.507 --> 00:51:19.143 region:rollup2
ON THE NO POLITICAL PROGRAM FOR

00:51:18.008 --> 00:51:21.312 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE RIGHT RATING AT THAT HAS

00:51:19.143 --> 00:51:23.180 region:rollup2
A SPECIFIC TARGET ON CHRONICLE

00:51:21.312 --> 00:51:24.515 region:rollup2
WITH THIS AND WRITE LOW THIS

00:51:23.180 --> 00:51:26.650 region:rollup2
AUTUMN A PART OF THOSE THOSE

00:51:24.515 --> 00:51:27.785 region:rollup2
FUNDS HAVE BEEN BOTTLED UP IN

00:51:26.650 --> 00:51:29.553 region:rollup2
YEAH AND WE'RE PROBABLY.

00:51:27.785 --> 00:51:30.220 region:rollup2
POTENTIAL YEAR AWAY FROM BEING

00:51:29.553 --> 00:51:31.255 region:rollup2
ABLE TO TAP THOSE TO AGE IT FOR

00:51:30.220 --> 00:51:32.423 region:rollup2
ALMOST ALL OF OUR CAPITAL

00:51:31.255 --> 00:51:33.924 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS YOU SCORED

00:51:32.423 --> 00:51:34.892 region:rollup2
BETTER IF YOU TARGET THE MORE

00:51:33.924 --> 00:51:35.459 region:rollup2
DEEPLY PRODUCT PUBLICIST SO IN

00:51:34.892 --> 00:51:36.694 region:rollup2
THAT WAY WE. WE INCENTIVIZE

00:51:35.459 --> 00:51:37.494 region:rollup2
THAT.

00:51:36.694 --> 00:51:39.430 region:rollup2
BUT THOSE ARE ALL ON THE

00:51:37.494 --> 00:51:40.331 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENT SIDE OF THINGS THIS

00:51:39.430 --> 00:51:41.665 region:rollup2
IS THE ONLY PROGRAM THAT WE

00:51:40.331 --> 00:51:46.103 region:rollup2
ADMINISTER THAT'S KIND OF THE

00:51:41.665 --> 00:51:47.705 region:rollup2
NON CAPITAL.

00:51:46.103 --> 00:51:49.740 region:rollup2
.

00:51:47.705 --> 00:51:50.708 region:rollup2
OPTION FOR THE MOST PART GREAT

00:51:49.740 --> 00:51:51.241 region:rollup2
AND THEN A FINAL QUESTION M..

00:51:50.708 --> 00:51:51.909 region:rollup2
THE SP TWO ESTIMATES FOR

00:51:51.241 --> 00:51:52.376 region:rollup2
SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN RIGHT NOW ARE

00:51:51.909 --> 00:51:54.979 region:rollup2
FAR LOWER THAN WHAT WE

00:51:52.376 --> 00:51:56.347 region:rollup2
I HOPE FOR A NO.

00:51:54.979 --> 00:51:57.781 region:rollup2
TO UNDER FIFTY MILLION OR MORE

00:51:56.347 --> 00:52:00.150 region:rollup2
OF WHAT WE HAD ANTICIPATED GET

00:51:57.781 --> 00:52:01.585 region:rollup2
FROM SP TWO COULD YOU OR COULD

00:52:00.150 --> 00:52:03.487 region:rollup2
SOMEONE EXPLAIN WHY THE

00:52:01.585 --> 00:52:04.822 region:rollup2
ESTIMATES ARE. HALF OF WHAT WE

00:52:03.487 --> 00:52:07.891 region:rollup2
HAD THOUGHT WE VOTED ON LAST

00:52:04.822 --> 00:52:09.393 region:rollup2
YEAR.

00:52:07.891 --> 00:52:10.327 region:rollup2
AND SO THE ESTIMATES STILL

00:52:09.393 --> 00:52:12.429 region:rollup2
REMAINS A TWO HUNDRED FIFTY

00:52:10.327 --> 00:52:13.797 region:rollup2
MILLION TOTAL FOR THE CALENDAR

00:52:12.429 --> 00:52:14.698 region:rollup2
YEAR BUT BECAUSE OF THE.

00:52:13.797 --> 00:52:16.667 region:rollup2
ALIGNMENT OF THE BUDGET YEAR

00:52:14.698 --> 00:52:17.635 region:rollup2
AND THE CALENDAR YEAR I THINK

00:52:16.667 --> 00:52:19.269 region:rollup2
THAT'S THAT ONE HUNDRED TWENTY

00:52:17.635 --> 00:52:21.972 region:rollup2
NINE MILLION YOU OKAY SO IT IS

00:52:19.269 --> 00:52:24.008 region:rollup2
IT IS A COUNTER YOU.

00:52:21.972 --> 00:52:24.341 region:rollup2
AGAIN THANK YOU FOR YOUR

00:52:24.008 --> 00:52:25.142 region:rollup2
PRESENTATION.

00:52:24.341 --> 00:52:27.077 region:rollup2
.

00:52:25.142 --> 00:52:28.912 region:rollup2
FOR OUR COLLEAGUES I THINK WE'LL

00:52:27.077 --> 00:52:29.480 region:rollup2
KNOW THAT.

00:52:28.912 --> 00:52:31.215 region:rollup2
NOT ONLY DO WITH A HOUSING

00:52:29.480 --> 00:52:32.950 region:rollup2
CRISIS WE'VE HOMELESSNESS CRISIS

00:52:31.215 --> 00:52:34.485 region:rollup2
IN THE CHALLENGES. THAT WE'VE

00:52:32.950 --> 00:52:35.953 region:rollup2
HAD IS A STATE IS GETTING FUNDS

00:52:34.485 --> 00:52:37.921 region:rollup2
GETTING ENOUGH FUNDS QUICKLY

00:52:35.953 --> 00:52:38.756 region:rollup2
ENOUGH TO PROGRAMS AT WORK AND I

00:52:37.921 --> 00:52:40.257 region:rollup2
THINK.

00:52:38.756 --> 00:52:41.058 region:rollup2
WE.

00:52:40.257 --> 00:52:42.726 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WE'RE STARTING GET

00:52:41.058 --> 00:52:44.361 region:rollup2
FUNDS OUT BUT BECAUSE NO PLACE

00:52:42.726 --> 00:52:45.362 region:rollup2
LIKE HOME MONIES HAVE BEEN HELD

00:52:44.361 --> 00:52:45.929 region:rollup2
UP THAT HASN'T BEEN ABLE TO GET

00:52:45.362 --> 00:52:48.732 region:rollup2
OUT.

00:52:45.929 --> 00:52:50.334 region:rollup2
WE HAVE A POT OF MONEY THAT WE

00:52:48.732 --> 00:52:51.635 region:rollup2
NEED TO GET OUT FASTER.

00:52:50.334 --> 00:52:53.270 region:rollup2
AND THAT WE HAVE THE ODYSSEY

00:52:51.635 --> 00:52:55.072 region:rollup2
NEED TO WRAP IT UP AND THEN WHAT

00:52:53.270 --> 00:52:56.473 region:rollup2
MR UPSET WAS TALKING ABOUT WAS.

00:52:55.072 --> 00:52:58.275 region:rollup2
A WAS HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THESE

00:52:56.473 --> 00:53:00.811 region:rollup2
FUNDS ARE WELL USED AND AND I

00:52:58.275 --> 00:53:03.280 region:rollup2
THINK ALL OF US ARE. ACUTELY.

INTERESTED IN AND SEE THE

00:53:03.280 --> 00:53:06.483 region:rollup2
OUTCOME OF WHERE THE

00:53:04.715 --> 00:53:07.985 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION GETS WITHOUT HOW

00:53:06.483 --> 00:53:10.154 region:rollup2
THE YEARS SHE PROGRAM IS CHANGED

00:53:07.985 --> 00:53:11.422 region:rollup2
ARE BUT. A AGAIN APPRECIATE ALL

00:53:10.154 --> 00:53:12.256 region:rollup2

00:53:16.960 --> 00:53:20.197 region:rollup2
EXACTLY THE CURRENT THINKING OF

00:53:19.630 --> 00:53:20.698 region:rollup2
OF HOW THOSE MONIES WILL BE

00:53:20.197 --> 00:53:23.333 region:rollup2
USED.

INTO UP PUTTING TOGETHER

00:53:29.773 --> 00:53:32.342 region:rollup2
SOMETHING VERY QUICKLY.

00:53:31.508 --> 00:53:35.212 region:rollup2
AND.

IN INCOME AND WE LOOK AT THIS

00:53:36.513 --> 00:53:39.249 region:rollup2
HOMELESS ISSUE IS LOOKING AT

BEST PRACTICES WHAT'S WORKING

00:53:39.249 --> 00:53:42.286 region:rollup2
AND WHAT COMMUNITIES I DON'T

00:53:40.451 --> 00:53:44.822 region:rollup2
KNOW HOW WE GET THERE. FRANKLY

00:53:42.286 --> 00:53:45.856 region:rollup2
I'M BUT MAYBE IT'S AFTER A YEAR

00:53:44.822 --> 00:53:48.125 region:rollup2
OF PUTTING THESE FUNDS OUT THERE

00:53:45.856 --> 00:53:48.659 region:rollup2
WE TAKE A STEP BACK AND TRY TO

00:53:48.125 --> 00:53:48.926 region:rollup2
FIGURE OUT WHAT'S ACTUALLY

00:53:48.659 --> 00:53:50.794 region:rollup2
WORKING.

00:53:48.926 --> 00:53:53.964 region:rollup2
.

00:53:50.794 --> 00:53:54.531 region:rollup2
MY OPINION LOCALLY IN MY REGION

00:53:53.964 --> 00:53:56.100 region:rollup2
IS THAT.

00:53:54.531 --> 00:53:57.601 region:rollup2
WE KEEP DOING THE SAME THING

00:53:56.100 --> 00:53:58.802 region:rollup2
OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND IT'S NOT

00:53:57.601 --> 00:54:01.405 region:rollup2
ANY MORE SUCCESSFUL THAN THE

00:53:58.802 --> 00:54:03.740 region:rollup2
YEAR BEFORE AND SO. ON I REALLY

00:54:01.405 --> 00:54:04.341 region:rollup2
APPRECIATE THAT THAT LIST OF

00:54:03.740 --> 00:54:05.609 region:rollup2
THINGS THAT YOU WENT THROUGH

00:54:04.341 --> 00:54:06.677 region:rollup2
THAT I TRADED TAKE NOTES AND IF

00:54:05.609 --> 00:54:08.579 region:rollup2
YOU CAN PRETTY YOU KNOW PRESENT

00:54:06.677 --> 00:54:09.213 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT'S A LITTLE BIT

00:54:08.579 --> 00:54:11.315 region:rollup2
MORE FORMAL THAT WOULD BE MUCH

00:54:09.213 --> 00:54:12.516 region:rollup2
APPRECIATED THANK YOU. IN JUST A

00:54:11.315 --> 00:54:13.951 region:rollup2
FOLLOW UP AND ON THE STREET YOU

00:54:12.516 --> 00:54:15.052 region:rollup2
EARLIER TALKED ABOUT REPORTING

00:54:13.951 --> 00:54:15.686 region:rollup2
THAT I DO BELIEVE IT'S.

00:54:15.052 --> 00:54:17.287 region:rollup2
THE COUNTIES AND CITIES HAVE THE

00:54:15.686 --> 00:54:17.888 region:rollup2
BEST.

00:54:17.287 --> 00:54:19.356 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WHAT'S BEST FOR THEIR

00:54:17.888 --> 00:54:21.091 region:rollup2
JURISDICTIONS BUT. AT SOME POINT

00:54:19.356 --> 00:54:22.860 region:rollup2
SOME REPORT BACK WAS WORKING NOT

00:54:21.091 --> 00:54:24.361 region:rollup2
ONE NOT WORKING LOT OF MONEY'S

00:54:22.860 --> 00:54:25.796 region:rollup2
GOING OUT AND WE NEVER GET.

00:54:24.361 --> 00:54:27.364 region:rollup2
WHAT'S AFFECTED WAS NOT THAT'S

00:54:25.796 --> 00:54:28.765 region:rollup2
WITH THE BIGGEST ISSUE NOT JUST

00:54:27.364 --> 00:54:31.135 region:rollup2
HOMELESSNESS THE MONTHS A LOT OF

00:54:28.765 --> 00:54:32.436 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS STATE PROGRAMS.

00:54:31.135 --> 00:54:34.104 region:rollup2
I DON'T THINK I AGREE COMPLETELY

00:54:32.436 --> 00:54:34.671 region:rollup2
WITH YOU INTENDED TO SPEAK TO

00:54:34.104 --> 00:54:35.305 region:rollup2
YOUR WE PUT WITH HAVING YOUR

00:54:34.671 --> 00:54:35.906 region:rollup2
OWN.

00:54:35.305 --> 00:54:37.141 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW SOME OF THESE THINGS

00:54:35.906 --> 00:54:37.808 region:rollup2
WITH MANY MORE THINGS THAT HAVE

00:54:37.141 --> 00:54:39.343 region:rollup2
BEEN BEST PRACTICES THAT MAKE ME

00:54:37.808 --> 00:54:41.245 region:rollup2
IS THAT WE WANT TO ALLOW FOR

00:54:39.343 --> 00:54:43.847 region:rollup2
RIGHTS WE WANT READ AS AN OPTION

00:54:41.245 --> 00:54:46.416 region:rollup2
OTHER COMMUNITIES TO REPLICATE

00:54:43.847 --> 00:54:47.918 region:rollup2
IF THEY CAN'T. SO THERE REPORT

00:54:46.416 --> 00:54:48.485 region:rollup2
BACK EVERY HIT FROM THESE LOCAL

00:54:47.918 --> 00:54:50.787 region:rollup2
JURISDICTIONS ON MONEY SPENT

00:54:48.485 --> 00:54:51.655 region:rollup2
AND.

00:54:50.787 --> 00:54:52.289 region:rollup2
WITH THE PLAN WITH THAT

00:54:51.655 --> 00:54:53.490 region:rollup2
WE HAVE BEEN DEPLOYED ANY FUNDS

00:54:52.289 --> 00:54:54.725 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY IN THIS MANNER YET SO

00:54:53.490 --> 00:54:55.526 region:rollup2
WE WOULD OUTLINED IN RIGHTS

00:54:54.725 --> 00:54:57.194 region:rollup2
GUIDELINES WITH EXPECT

00:54:55.526 --> 00:54:57.761 region:rollup2
IT WOULD BE FOR.

00:54:57.194 --> 00:54:58.762 region:rollup2
BUT THERE WILL BE GUIDELINES

00:54:57.761 --> 00:55:00.564 region:rollup2
WITH THAT THERE. WE WOULD REVISE

00:54:58.762 --> 00:55:02.466 region:rollup2
OUR CURRENT IF YOU GOT LET'S NOT

00:55:00.564 --> 00:55:03.467 region:rollup2
PLY THEM TO FULFILL THESE POTS

00:55:02.466 --> 00:55:04.034 region:rollup2
OF MONEY SO MAYBE CALL THE NEW

00:55:03.467 --> 00:55:04.968 region:rollup2
SOMETHING NEW AND IN THE END

00:55:04.034 --> 00:55:05.135 region:rollup2
BUT.

00:55:04.968 --> 00:55:07.204 region:rollup2
BUT.

00:55:05.135 --> 00:55:08.505 region:rollup2
BUT WE WOULD PUT OUT FOR THE

00:55:07.204 --> 00:55:09.773 region:rollup2
FRAMEWORK AYE I LAID OUT YES

00:55:08.505 --> 00:55:12.209 region:rollup2
PROGRAM THAT LETS AND FINALIZE

00:55:09.773 --> 00:55:12.809 region:rollup2
GUIDELINES AS TO KEEP THE

00:55:12.209 --> 00:55:14.077 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE EXPERT REVERSING WE

00:55:12.809 --> 00:55:15.879 region:rollup2
EXPECT THAT.

00:55:14.077 --> 00:55:16.346 region:rollup2
DESKTOP REPORT BACKS WE CAN LOOK

00:55:15.879 --> 00:55:16.680 region:rollup2
AT IT AND HE WAS BEING

00:55:16.346 --> 00:55:17.314 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVE.

00:55:16.680 --> 00:55:21.018 region:rollup2
SO.

00:55:17.314 --> 00:55:22.019 region:rollup2
HOW MUCH MONEY WE SPENT BY JULY?

00:55:21.018 --> 00:55:23.453 region:rollup2
HOW WOULD YOU SAY WE SPEND IT

00:55:22.019 --> 00:55:24.555 region:rollup2
WILL IT WILL GO UP BY THIS JULY

00:55:23.453 --> 00:55:25.956 region:rollup2
WILL BE GOTTEN AUGUST WE WEGET

00:55:24.555 --> 00:55:27.524 region:rollup2
THAT WE GET SO WE GET THAT WE

00:55:25.956 --> 00:55:28.892 region:rollup2
GET QUARTERLY REPORTS THIRTY

00:55:27.524 --> 00:55:29.893 region:rollup2
DAYS AFTER EACH QUARTER FROM THE

COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE WE HAVE

00:55:29.893 --> 00:55:32.596 region:rollup2
EVEN? GOTTEN OUR FIRST QUARTER'S

00:55:31.228 --> 00:55:33.630 region:rollup2
WORTH OF OF OF FUNDS THAT WE

00:55:32.596 --> 00:55:34.965 region:rollup2
HOPE THAT THAT BY THE END THIS

00:55:33.630 --> 00:55:36.767 region:rollup2
MONTH WE WILL HAVE THAT. AND

00:55:34.965 --> 00:55:39.236 region:rollup2
THEN WE GET THE SECOND QUARTERS

00:55:36.767 --> 00:55:40.771 region:rollup2
AT THE END OF JULY WE PUT A NO

00:55:39.236 --> 00:55:43.307 region:rollup2
FELT PUBLIC TO ACCEPT.

00:55:40.771 --> 00:55:44.641 region:rollup2
SO THEY FOCUS ON A SPENDING ESG

00:55:43.307 --> 00:55:47.544 region:rollup2
A WILL HAPPEN WITH PROPOSED

00:55:44.641 --> 00:55:48.612 region:rollup2
TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE.

00:55:47.544 --> 00:55:50.480 region:rollup2
WE WOULD AMEND OUR PROGRAM TO

ACCOMMODATE ANYTHING THAT WAS IN

00:55:50.480 --> 00:55:52.082 region:rollup2
THE BUDGET.

00:55:51.181 --> 00:55:53.717 region:rollup2
I MEAN I WAS THAT'S PENDING

00:55:52.082 --> 00:55:55.819 region:rollup2
LANGUAGE SO THAT'S WILL BE

00:55:53.717 --> 00:55:56.687 region:rollup2
STRUCTURED OUR OUR PROCESS SO IT

00:55:55.819 --> 00:55:58.388 region:rollup2
FOLLOWS THE PATH TO THE STATE

00:55:56.687 --> 00:55:59.856 region:rollup2
BUDGET SO ANY FINALIZATION WE

00:55:58.388 --> 00:56:02.626 region:rollup2
COULD INCORPORATE.

00:55:59.856 --> 00:56:04.194 region:rollup2
A CHANGES THAT WERE MADE.

00:56:02.626 --> 00:56:05.362 region:rollup2

HUNDRED TWENTY NINE MILLION

DOLLARS BECAUSE THAT THE

00:56:26.583 --> 00:56:28.318 region:rollup2
ANALYSIS FROM THE COMMITTEE

TWENTY SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN

00:56:54.411 --> 00:56:56.213 region:rollup2

MILLION EVERY EVERY FISCAL YEAR

00:57:10.661 --> 00:57:13.697 region:rollup2
BASED ON SB TWO FUNDS

00:57:12.663 --> 00:57:15.065 region:rollup2

00:57:19.703 --> 00:57:22.639 region:rollup2
MICHAEL HAD OPEN UP TO PUBLIC

00:57:21.271 --> 00:57:29.112 region:rollup2
COMMENT ANYONE WISH TO SPEAK ON

00:57:22.639 --> 00:57:30.447 region:rollup2
THIS ITEM.

00:57:29.112 --> 00:57:31.548 region:rollup2
GOOD AFTERNOON SHARONREPORT

00:57:30.447 --> 00:57:32.950 region:rollup2
WITH THE CORPORATION FOR

00:57:31.548 --> 00:57:34.751 region:rollup2
SUPPORTIVE HOUSING.

00:57:32.950 --> 00:57:36.520 region:rollup2
AND WE TO APPRECIATE THE WORK

00:57:34.751 --> 00:57:38.922 region:rollup2
THAT AGE CITY HAS DONE ON THIS

00:57:36.520 --> 00:57:40.457 region:rollup2
ISSUE. AYE WE HAVE SOME CONCERNS

00:57:38.922 --> 00:57:41.825 region:rollup2
WITH THE MONEY GOING THROUGH THE

00:57:40.457 --> 00:57:42.793 region:rollup2
EMERGENCY SOLUTIONS GRANT

00:57:41.825 --> 00:57:43.827 region:rollup2
PROGRAM.

00:57:42.793 --> 00:57:45.562 region:rollup2
WE HAVE.

00:57:43.827 --> 00:57:47.531 region:rollup2
HEARD BASICALLY THAT

00:57:45.562 --> 00:57:50.067 region:rollup2
PRELIMINARY OF FINDINGS THAT

00:57:47.531 --> 00:57:52.202 region:rollup2
WE'VE SEEN SO FAR ON RAPIDLY

00:57:50.067 --> 00:57:53.670 region:rollup2
HOUSING IN CALIFORNIA HAVE NOT

00:57:52.202 --> 00:57:55.172 region:rollup2
SHOWN GREAT SUCCESS FOR THIS

00:57:53.670 --> 00:57:57.908 region:rollup2
INTERVENTION.

00:57:55.172 --> 00:57:59.409 region:rollup2
IN FACT THREE QUARTERS OF OUR

00:57:57.908 --> 00:58:00.877 region:rollup2
STATES HOMELESS POPULATION ARE

00:57:59.409 --> 00:58:03.981 region:rollup2
SINGLE ADULTS.

00:58:00.877 --> 00:58:05.816 region:rollup2
AND FOR THAT POPULATION RAPIDLY

00:58:03.981 --> 00:58:07.985 region:rollup2
HOUSING HAS NOT PRUNED PROVEN TO

00:58:05.816 --> 00:58:09.786 region:rollup2
BE SUCCESSFUL GENERALLY THESE

00:58:07.985 --> 00:58:11.121 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS AND UP HITTING A

00:58:09.786 --> 00:58:11.655 region:rollup2
CLIFF AT SOME POINT WHERE THAT

00:58:11.121 --> 00:58:13.490 region:rollup2
RENTAL ASSISTANCE ENDS AND

00:58:11.655 --> 00:58:16.259 region:rollup2
THEIR.

00:58:13.490 --> 00:58:18.095 region:rollup2
CYCLING BACK INTO HOMELESSNESS

00:58:16.259 --> 00:58:20.230 region:rollup2
I'LL BE THINK THAT PUTTING THE

00:58:18.095 --> 00:58:22.933 region:rollup2
MONEY INTO ESG WILL JUST FURTHER

00:58:20.230 --> 00:58:24.568 region:rollup2
THE CYCLE AND OF NOT GO TOWARD

00:58:22.933 --> 00:58:26.136 region:rollup2
PROVEN METHODS ON IT HAVE

00:58:24.568 --> 00:58:28.939 region:rollup2
RAPIDLY HOUSING IS ACTUALLY NOT

00:58:26.136 --> 00:58:30.374 region:rollup2
YET IN EVIDENCE BASED PRACTICE.

00:58:28.939 --> 00:58:31.875 region:rollup2
AND.

00:58:30.374 --> 00:58:33.377 region:rollup2
WE DO THINK THAT THE MONEY

00:58:31.875 --> 00:58:35.946 region:rollup2
SHOULD NOT GO BY FORMULA BUT

00:58:33.377 --> 00:58:37.714 region:rollup2
SHOULD GO TO CITIES AND COUNTIES

00:58:35.946 --> 00:58:39.783 region:rollup2
THAT APPLY AND SHOW THAT THEY

00:58:37.714 --> 00:58:42.085 region:rollup2
HAVE THE CAPACITY TO. I USE THE

00:58:39.783 --> 00:58:43.720 region:rollup2
MONEY ALLOCATED QUICKLY TO GET

00:58:42.085 --> 00:58:45.055 region:rollup2
PEOPLE OFF THE STREETS QUICKLY.

00:58:43.720 --> 00:58:46.023 region:rollup2
TOWARD THAT END WE DO THINK THAT

00:58:45.055 --> 00:58:48.291 region:rollup2

.

01:07:07.724 --> 01:07:09.959 region:rollup2
I WASN'T SURE IF THAT WAS GONNA

01:07:09.192 --> 01:07:11.494 region:rollup2
BE THE CASE AND AND I'M

01:07:09.959 --> 01:07:14.264 region:rollup2
WONDERING IF.

01:07:11.494 --> 01:07:15.832 region:rollup2

SPENT.

01:07:29.445 --> 01:07:32.282 region:rollup2

.

01:07:34.083 --> 01:07:36.085 region:rollup2
BUT I THINK WE'VE ALSO

01:07:35.084 --> 01:07:39.322 region:rollup2

01:07:36.085 --> 01:07:40.356 region:rollup2
STAFFING NEEDS BASED ON SP TO

01:07:39.322 --> 01:07:42.592 region:rollup2
FROM WHEN WE USE THE SG

01:07:40.356 --> 01:07:43.793 region:rollup2
PROGRAMMERS ARE RESOURCE BUT I

01:07:42.592 --> 01:07:45.194 region:rollup2
I'M NOT SURE THE RIBBING MUCH

01:07:43.793 --> 01:07:46.930 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT SO IT TO THE EXTENT

01:07:45.194 --> 01:07:48.965 region:rollup2
THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT S. B.

01:07:46.930 --> 01:07:51.768 region:rollup2

OKAY SO STAFF THERE WOULD IT

01:07:55.305 --> 01:07:59.409 region:rollup2
AFTER BE THERE DOVER IF THAT WAS

01:07:56.573 --> 01:08:00.376 region:rollup2
DESIGNED TO BEFORE. OKAY AND

01:07:59.409 --> 01:08:01.010 region:rollup2
THEN M. I PICKED IT UP A FULL

01:08:00.376 --> 01:08:02.412 region:rollup2
QUESTION RELATED TO SOME OF THE

FOCUSED ON RAPIDLY HOUSING

01:08:09.552 --> 01:08:11.054 region:rollup2
WHICH OBVIOUSLY ONLY FOCUSES ON

01:08:10.687 --> 01:08:13.122 region:rollup2
A SUB.

01:08:11.054 --> 01:08:14.257 region:rollup2

THAT YOU'RE PROPOSING IS GOING

01:08:17.527 --> 01:08:21.064 region:rollup2
TO CAPTURE. A THE THE

01:08:19.762 --> 01:08:23.199 region:rollup2
CHRONICALLY HOMELESS POPULATION

01:08:21.064 --> 01:08:24.801 region:rollup2

YEAH I I ACTUALLY WOULDN'T SAY

01:08:26.202 --> 01:08:29.038 region:rollup2
THIS IS THE IF YOU PROGRAM AT

01:08:27.303 --> 01:08:30.139 region:rollup2
ALL RIGHT WE ARE USING SOME OF

01:08:29.038 --> 01:08:31.641 region:rollup2
THAT ABOUT THE OTHER BASELINE

01:08:30.139 --> 01:08:33.376 region:rollup2
FOR CONTINUITY FOR YOU KNOW

01:08:31.641 --> 01:08:34.510 region:rollup2
RECIPIENTS IN THE SORT OF THINGS

01:08:33.376 --> 01:08:36.179 region:rollup2
BUT TERMS THE EXPANDED USES

01:08:34.510 --> 01:08:37.547 region:rollup2
THERE SO THERE SO MUCH BROADER.

01:08:36.179 --> 01:08:39.449 region:rollup2
THAN THAT WHAT WE WERE ABLE TO

01:08:37.547 --> 01:08:40.216 region:rollup2
DO BEFORE THAT I WOULDN'T

01:08:39.449 --> 01:08:41.584 region:rollup2
CHARACTERIZE WHAT WE'RE DOING

01:08:40.216 --> 01:08:43.386 region:rollup2
THE FOR EVEN AS YES TO EITHER

01:08:41.584 --> 01:08:44.520 region:rollup2
SOME YES YOU LIKE PROVISIONS

STILL DO A RAPPER HOUSING MODEL

01:08:47.156 --> 01:08:49.892 region:rollup2
IF YOU DETERMINE THAT WAS BEST

01:08:48.091 --> 01:08:51.561 region:rollup2
FOR YOUR. COMMUNITY BUT THERE'S

01:08:49.892 --> 01:08:53.663 region:rollup2
A NUMBER OF OTHER USES RIGHT

01:08:51.561 --> 01:08:55.298 region:rollup2
THAT THAT GO WELL BEYOND.

01:08:53.663 --> 01:08:57.333 region:rollup2
WHAT WE CURRENTLY OR PREVIOUSLY

01:08:55.298 --> 01:08:59.402 region:rollup2
WERE ABLE TO FUND AND SO WHILE

01:08:57.333 --> 01:09:01.571 region:rollup2
WE USE THAT AS A WAY TO?

01:08:59.402 --> 01:09:02.905 region:rollup2
MOVE FORWARD RIGHT IN TERMS OF

01:09:01.571 --> 01:09:04.440 region:rollup2

OUR GRANTEES THEIR COMMUNITIES.

01:09:04.440 --> 01:09:07.610 region:rollup2
I DON'T THINK IT'S PROBABLY

01:09:06.609 --> 01:09:09.145 region:rollup2
ACTOR TO SIT THIS ESP MOVING

01:09:07.610 --> 01:09:10.346 region:rollup2
FORWARD RIGHT THIS IS TAKING

01:09:09.145 --> 01:09:11.981 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE THINGS FROM ESPN

01:09:10.346 --> 01:09:13.983 region:rollup2
EXPANDING SIGNIFICANTLY BASED ON

01:09:11.981 --> 01:09:15.785 region:rollup2
THE. THE DEFICIENCIES THAT WERE

01:09:13.983 --> 01:09:17.920 region:rollup2
THERE THAT WE HEARD FROM AYE

01:09:15.785 --> 01:09:20.657 region:rollup2
ADVOCATES AND AND THE

01:09:17.920 --> 01:09:23.626 region:rollup2

YESTERDAY SO I I'M HEARING YOU

01:09:24.827 --> 01:09:29.065 region:rollup2
NOW SO ESSENTIALLY SOMETHING

01:09:28.431 --> 01:09:29.866 region:rollup2
THAT'S BROADER THAT ADDRESSES.

01:09:29.065 --> 01:09:31.834 region:rollup2
THE MULTIPLICITY OF OF

01:09:29.866 --> 01:09:33.202 region:rollup2
CHALLENGES THAT WERE SEEN WITH

01:09:31.834 --> 01:09:33.503 region:rollup2
YEAH I MEANIF IT HURTS A GUY I

01:09:33.202 --> 01:09:34.303 region:rollup2
DON'T KNOW.

01:09:33.503 --> 01:09:36.072 region:rollup2
BUT CERTAINLY IT THAT WE HOPE

01:09:34.303 --> 01:09:36.739 region:rollup2
IT WILL ALLOW TO GET AT SOME OF

01:09:36.072 --> 01:09:37.340 region:rollup2
THOSE USES ALL OF US THAT WILL

01:09:36.739 --> 01:09:38.775 region:rollup2
BE AT THE DISCRETION TO SOME

01:09:37.340 --> 01:09:40.009 region:rollup2
DEGREE OF THE THE LOCAL

BUT.

01:09:41.210 --> 01:09:43.346 region:rollup2
BUT WE DO THINK THAT THE

01:09:42.178 --> 01:09:44.247 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY IS THERE TO TO REACH

01:09:43.346 --> 01:09:45.848 region:rollup2
MUCH DEEPER.

ELEVEN.

01:42:32.279 --> 01:42:36.550 region:rollup2
THE SCIENCE CENTER WAS

01:42:33.247 --> 01:42:38.419 region:rollup2
SUCCESSFUL IN WINNING A NATIONAL

01:42:36.550 --> 01:42:40.321 region:rollup2

SINCE TWO THOUSAND TWELVE. WE

01:42:45.292 --> 01:42:49.196 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY ATTRACT SOMEWHERE NEAR

01:42:47.561 --> 01:42:51.699 region:rollup2
A MILLION PEOPLE A YEAR. ALL WHO

COME TO SEE IT THE IDEA HERE

01:42:51.699 --> 01:42:55.469 region:rollup2
WOULD BE THAT THE FOUNDATION.

01:42:53.334 --> 01:42:57.405 region:rollup2

01:42:55.469 --> 01:42:58.506 region:rollup2
PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP.

01:42:57.405 --> 01:42:59.940 region:rollup2
WHEREUPON WE WOULD BUILD A

01:42:58.506 --> 01:43:01.642 region:rollup2
BUILDING.

01:42:59.940 --> 01:43:04.145 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD BE A PERMANENT

THERE'S NO MONEY THAT WOULD NEED

01:43:10.618 --> 01:43:13.921 region:rollup2
TO CHANGE HANDS IN THIS BUDGET

01:43:12.086 --> 01:43:15.956 region:rollup2
YEAR IN FACT WE'RE LOOKING TO DO

01:43:13.921 --> 01:43:17.792 region:rollup2
IS TO EXTEND THE SAME TERMS.

01:43:15.956 --> 01:43:20.127 region:rollup2
THAT TOOK PLACE IN THE FACE TO

01:43:17.792 --> 01:43:21.195 region:rollup2
PROPOSAL SOME TWENTY YEARS AGO.

01:43:20.127 --> 01:43:23.230 region:rollup2

COMPLETE FACED THREE THE

01:43:23.230 --> 01:43:26.700 region:rollup2
FOUNDATION IS GOING TO PUT UP.

01:43:24.965 --> 01:43:28.069 region:rollup2

HAVE ALREADY RAISED.

01:43:31.138 --> 01:43:33.908 region:rollup2
OF THE STATE WOULD PUT UP

01:43:32.406 --> 01:43:36.277 region:rollup2
SOMEWHERE AROUND FORTY OF FIFTY

01:43:33.908 --> 01:43:38.012 region:rollup2
MILLION DOLLARS. AND THAT WOULD

01:43:36.277 --> 01:43:39.647 region:rollup2
BE PAID IN INCREMENTS BY

01:43:38.012 --> 01:43:41.582 region:rollup2
EXTENDING THE LEAST.

01:43:39.647 --> 01:43:43.851 region:rollup2
