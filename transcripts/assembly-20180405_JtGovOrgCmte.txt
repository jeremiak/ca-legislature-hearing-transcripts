AND BRING OF THIS MORNING'S JOINT INFORMATIONAL. A HEARING TO START. THANK YOU ALL FOR. BEING HERE IN ATTENDING THIS MORNING'S HEARING. SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND TWELVE THE TRIBAL NATION GRANT FUNDS BEEN INCLUDED EIGHTEEN TRIBAL STATE GAMING COMPACTS EXECUTED BY GOVERNOR BROWN. AS A MEANS TO INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF REVENUE SHARE BETWEEN THE SEVENTY PLUS TRIBES WHO ARE ELIGIBLE FOR REVENUE SHARING TRUST FUND ALLOCATIONS. THE TRIBAL NATION GRANT FUND IS DEFINED WITH THOSE COMPACTS IS A FUN TO MAKE DISCRETIONARY DISTRIBUTION OF FUNDS TO NON GAMING TRIBES AND LIMITED GAMING TRIBES. FOR PURPOSES RELATED TO EFFECTIVE SELF GOVERNANCE SELF DETERMINED COMMUNITY AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. THE VARIOUS SPECIFICS OF HOW THE. TRIBAL NATION GRANT FUNDED OPERATE. WAS NOT DETAILED IN PRIOR COMPAQ'S SO THAT ALL INTERESTED TRIBES COULD PARTICIPATE IN A BROADER DISCUSSION. TRIBAL PARTICIPATION IS TAKING PLACE THE REFORM DISCUSSIONS INFORMAL CONSULTATIONS HELD BETWEEN THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND CALIFORNIA'S ARE STF ELIGIBLE TRIBES. THE CALIFORNIA GIMMICK CONTROL COMMISSION ESTIMATES. THIS YEAR FOR THE FIRST TIME THERE WILL BE A SURPLUS OF APPROXIMATELY THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS IN REVENUE SHARING TRUST FUND. THIS SURPLUS AND FUTURE FUNDS COULD BE USED FOR BY THE ANNUAL FUNDING FOR THE TRIBAL NATION GRAPHITE. POWER BEFORE ANY APPROPRIATION BY THE LEGISLATURE CAN OCCUR. ENABLING LEGISLATION WOULD NEED TO BE ADOPTED TO PROVIDE GUIDELINES FOR THE OPERATION AND EXECUTION OF THE FUND. FOLLOWING THE FORMAL CONSULTATIONS WITH TRIBAL LEADERS IN AFTER COMMENT PERIOD LANGUAGES DRAFTED THAT INCORPORATE THE IDEAS CONCERNS SUGGESTIONS AND FINDINGS. LAST SEPTEMBER THE LANGUAGES AMENDED INTO A BILL. THAT I HAD ON THE TNG AFTER IN THE SENATE. I THEN HAD AB EIGHT EIGHTY PLACED ON THE SENATE NOT TO FILE TO GIVE THE RESPECTIVE STAKEHOLDERS THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE FURTHER INPUT. ON THIS IMPORTANT TOPIC. THE GOAL OF TODAY'S HEARING IS TO INFORM MEMBERS ABOUT THE HISTORY AND THE OBJECTIVES OF THE TRIBAL NATION GRANT FUND. I UNDERSTAND THE IMPLEMENTATION FRAMEWORK ESTABLISHED BY THE PROPOSED LEGISLATIVE LANGUAGE AND SEEK INPUT FROM ALL INTERESTED STAKEHOLDERS ON POTENTIAL REFINEMENTS OR IMPROVEMENTS TO THAT FRAMEWORK. WITH THAT. I WILL. GIVE IT THE SENATE AN OPPORTUNITY TO COMMENT WHEN THE. ARRIVED THEY'VE JUST ADJOURNED OF SO WILL BE BEING JOINED BY. A CHAIRMAN DODD. MOMENTARILY AND WE WILL MOVE TO ITEM TWO ON THE PUBLIC AGENDA. AND ASKING NEED ONLY OUR PRINCIPAL FISCAL POLICY ANALYST LEGISLATIVE SOBS TO GO AHEAD AND APPROACH. A AND BEGIN. HER PRESENTATION THANK YOU SO MUCH TO I'M PROVIDE SOME CONTEXT FOR YOUR DISCUSSION TODAY ON THE TRIBAL NATION GRANT FUND. INSIST PACIFIC WE WILL BE PROVIDING AN OVERVIEW OF THE TRIBAL GAMING FUNDS HOW THE FISCAL CONDITION OF THESE FUNDS HAVE CHANGED IN RECENT YEARS TO ISSUE THE RENEGOTIATION COMPAQ. AND THEN ALSO ESTIMATES FOR HOW MUCH COULD BE DEPOSITED INTO A COUPLE OF THESE FUNDS IN THE FUTURE. SO IN PRIOR YEARS GAMING COMPACTS GENERALLY REQUIRE TRIBES MAKE PAYMENTS INTO VARIOUS STATE ACCOUNTS DEPENDING ON CERTAIN CONDITIONS. AND SO THESE ACCOUNTS WHERE THE REVENUE SHARING TRUST FUND THE HARDEST YAFFE SPECIAL DISTRIBUTION FIND THE STF IN THE STATE GENERAL FUNDS. THE SPECIFIC PAYMENT REQUIREMENTS INTO EACH OF THESE ACCOUNTS GENERALLY DEFERRED ACROSS THE TRIBES AND DEPENDED ON VARIOUS FACTORS INCLUDING THE NUMBER OF MACHINES OPERATED. AS WELL AS THE AVERAGE SLOT MACHINE THAT WENT. SO PAYMENTS THAT WERE DEPOSITED INTO THE ARTIST YAFFE ARE DISTRIBUTED TO CERTAIN FEDERALLY RECOGNIZED TRIBES THAT EITHER DO NOT OPERATE CASINOS OR THAT OPERATE CASINOS WITH FEWER THAN THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MACHINES. IN EACH OF THESE TRIALS ARE GENERALLY SUPPOSED TO RECEIVE ALLOCATIONS ON ONE POINT ONE MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY. SINCE TWO THOUSAND ONE TWO WHEN OUR STAFF WAS FIRST CREATED. ANNUAL EXPENDITURES FROM THE FINE WHO GENERALLY EXCEEDED ANNUAL REVENUES. PAYMENTS THEN DEPOSITED INTO THE STF WERE GENERALLY AUTHORIZED FOR FOR PURPOSES IN THE FOLLOWING PRIORITY ORDER. FIRST TO BACKFILL THOSE SHORTFALLS IN OUR STF THAT I JUST MENTIONED SECOND FOR PROBLEM GAMING. THIRD OF FOR REGULATORY COSTS AND FOURTH PAYMENTS TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THAT WERE IMPACTED BY THE TRIBAL CASINOS THESE ARE SOMETIMES KNOWN AS LOCAL MITIGATION GRANTS. SIMILAR TO THE RCF SINCE TWO THOUSAND EATS NINE THE ANNUAL EXPENDITURES FROM THE STF HAVE GENERALLY EXCEEDED THE ANNUAL REVENUES. AND SO FINALLY CERTAIN TRIBES WERE ALSO REQUIRED TO MAKE PAYMENTS INTO THE STATE GENERAL FUNDS. IN THIS REALLY STARTED IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN EIGHT. HOWEVER THE NINTH CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEAL RULED IN THE RING CON BAND VERSUS SCHWARZENEGGER CASE THAT THESE TYPES OF PAYMENTS WERE NOT PERMITTED. SO IN ORDER TO ADDRESS ALL OF THESE ISSUES THE STATE CHANGED THE PAYMENT STRUCTURE THAT WERE REQUIRED IN TRIBAL STATE COMPACT THAT WERE RENEGOTIATED IN RECENT YEARS. SPECIFICALLY THE RE NEGOTIATED COMPACTS REQUIRED INCREASED PAYMENTS TO THE ARTIST YEAH. AND AUTHORIZE THE TRANSFERS OF MONIES THAT WERE NOT NEEDED TO PROVIDE ALL ELIGIBLE TRIBES WITH ONE POINT ONE MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY. THESE MONIES ARE THE ONES THAT WOULD BE TRANSFERRED INTO THIS NEW TRIBAL NATION GRANT FUNDS WHICH YOU'LL BE HAVING FURTHER DISCUSSION ABOUT TODAY. SO THESE FUNDS AS MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY WORD TO BE ALLOCATED AS GRANTS TO TRIBES I EITHER DID NOT OPERATE CASINOS ARE AHEAD CASINOS WITH FEWER THAN THREE HUNDRED FIFTY MACHINES. FOR THE PURPOSE OF SELF SUFFICIENCY ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OR COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT. THE RENEGOTIATE COMPAQ'S ALSO ELIMINATED PAYMENTS TO THE GENERAL FUND AND GENERALLY SHIFTED MITIGATION OUR OTHER PAYMENTS TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AWAY FROM THE STF. AND INSTEAD TRIES WERE GENERALLY SUPPOSED TO REACH THEIR OWN AGREEMENTS WITH THEIR RESPECTIVE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS FOR THESE TYPES OF PAYMENTS. AS OF THIS TIME AND THAT THE STF WOULD GENERALLY BE ONLY USED TO FIND STATE REGULATORY OUR PROBLEM GAMING COSTS. SO A NUMBER OF THESE RENEGOTIATE CONTACTS HAVE JUST RECENTLY GONE INTO A FACT SO THE FULL IMPACT OF THESE NEW TERMS ON PAYMENT DEPOSITS INTO THE ARIAS TFR GENERALLY UNCERTAIN. PRELIMINARY ESTIMATES INDICATE THAT ABOUT. A HUNDRED AND TEN MILLION WILL BE DEPOSITED INTO THE OUR STAFF AND THAT ABOUT EIGHTY MILLION WILL BE NEEDED TO PROVIDE SEVENTY TWO ELIGIBLE TRIBES. WITH THEIR FULL ALLOTMENT IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN. THIS MEANS THAT ABOUT TWENTY TO THIRTY MILLION COULD BE AVAILABLE FOR TRANSFER INTO THE TRIBAL NATION GRANT FUNDS. AND THIS COULD BE THE CASE ANNUALLY FOR THE NEXT FEW YEARS IN THE NEAR TERM. IN THE LONG RUN THIS AMOUNT COULD POTENTIALLY INCREASE TO EXCEED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS BUT THERE IS SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTY TO THAT. I THINK AS TIME GOES ON AND WILL BE TRACKING THOSE REVENUE DEPOSITS WILL HAVE A BETTER SENSE OF WHAT THE FUTURE LOOKS LIKE. AND SO THE WITH THAT WILL CONCLUDE OUR COMMENTS ARE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE. THANK YOU APPRECIATE YOUR PRESENTATION AT THIS TIME WE'VE BEEN JOINED. BY SENATE. GENERALIZATION SHARE OF THE GERMAN DOG AND SO GO AHEAD AND NOW MOVES TO HIM FOR SMOKING REMARKS. THANK YOU ARE CHAIRMAN GRAY AND THANKS TO YOUR STAFF FOR A. HELP ME PUT THIS COMMITTEE TOGETHER IT COMMITTEE MEETING TOGETHER JOINT COMMITTEE I APOLOGIZE FOR BEING LATE LOT GOING ON THE CAPITAL THIS MORNING. AS MANY OF YOU KNOW THE GREAT RANCHERIA COMPACT IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE. WAS THE FIRST COMPACT THAT INCLUDED THE TRIBAL NATION GRATIFIED. AS THE CENTER WHO REPRESENTS SECOND UNION ESPECIALLY THANKFUL TO BE HERE TODAY IS THE CHAIR OF THE SENATE GEO COMMITTEE. I'M HOPEFUL THAT TODAY'S HEARING HELPS OUR RESPECTIVE COMMITTEES CRAFT LEGISLATION. THAT IS BOTH FAIR AND RESPECTFUL OF TRIBAL SOVEREIGNTY. I'M ALSO LOOKING FORWARD TO HEARING IDEAS ON HOW WE CAN GUARANTEE THAT THE FUNDS WILL BE USED TO EMPOWER TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS. TO ADDRESS THE MANY NEEDS OF THEIR COMMUNITIES. ONCE AGAIN THANK YOU CHAIRMAN GREAT AND THANKS IN ADVANCE ALL THE WITNESSES WHO AGREED. TO TESTIFY HERE TODAY. OKAY AT THIS TIME. MEMBERS WILL GO AHEAD MOVE. NOT FOR QUESTIONS FROM THE MEMBERS IF ANYONE. WOULD LIKE TO ASK ANY QUESTIONS OF. MS LEE WE CAN TAKE THOSE AT THIS TIME. SEEING I HAD I HAD รณ ON. SENATOR DR NESTLE BECAUSE I WAS A LITTLE BIT YOU MAY HAVE ALREADY. ANSWER THIS QUESTION BUT I'M JUST MOVING FORWARD WE HAVE AN IDEA OF HOW MUCH. FUNDS WILL BE DEPOSITED IN. THE TNG OFF ON A YEARLY BASIS. ABSOLUTELY SO CURRENTLY. A NUMBER OF THE RENEGOTIATE COMICS HAVE JUST GONE INTO EFFECT SO THE IMPACTS ARE STILL LITTLE UNCERTAIN. BUT PRELIMINARY ESTIMATES HAVE INDICATED THAT ABOUT A HUNDRED AND TEN MILLION WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR DEPOSIT INTO THE RST HALF THE REVENUE SHARING TRUST FUND. AND THAT ABOUT EIGHTY MILLION OF THAT WILL BE NEEDED TO PROVIDE THE ELIGIBLE TRIBES WITH THEIR ONE POINT ONE MILLION DOLLAR ALLOCATIONS. SO THIS MEANS THAT ABOUT TWENTY TO THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS WOULD BE AVAILABLE FOR TRANSFER INTO THE TRIBAL NATION GRANT FUNDS. THIS AMOUNT COULD INCREASE IN FUTURE YEARS TO EXCEED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS BUT THERE IS SOME UNCERTAINTY TO THAT AND SO WE WILL BE MONITORING DEPOSITS AND AS THE COMPLEX KIND OF REALLY GOING TO AFFECT. GREAT THANK YOU. ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS. SEEING NONE WHO ARE. THANK YOU AND MS LAHAM WE WILL MOVE TO ITEM THREE ON THE AGENDA. ASK BOTH JOE DILLON. AND CRISTINA STARTED TO APPROACH AND. PROCEED WITH THEIR PRESENTATIONS WATER OR HEAR FIRST FROM JOE DILLON SENIOR ADVISER. FOR TRIBAL NEGOTIATIONS THE OFFICE OF GOVERNOR BROWN. WELCOME BACK WHICH DON'T. WELL GOOD MORNING. THANK YOU FOR THE FOR TAKING THE TIME OUT OF YOUR BUSY SCHEDULE TO TALK WITH THIS IMPORTANT TOPIC. ALL PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF THE OBJECTIVES HISTORY IN A BASIC ASSEMBLY OF THE KIND BILL LANGUAGE. TRIBAL ADVISORS. SNYDER I WILL LOOK FORWARD AND DISCUSS ISSUES RELATED TO IMPLEMENTATION. THAT THE GOAL OF THAT TRIBAL NATION GRAND FUND IS TO GET ADDITIONAL FUNDS TO THE GOVERNMENTS OF THE OUR STF ELIGIBLE TRIBES IN A MANNER THAT'S FAIR TO THE TRIBE TO CONTRIBUTE. ABOUT. AND FAIR AFFECTED AND RESPECTFUL OF THE TRIBES THAT RECEIVE THOSE FUNDS ABOUT WHEN THE THAT PEOPLE AMENDED THE CONSTITUTION TO ALLOW TRIBES IN AT THIS POINT ONLY TRIBE TO OFFER CERTAIN FORMS OF CLASS REGAINING THE INTENT WAS TO ALL TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS TO BENEFIT FROM. FROM GAMING AS WE LOOK AROUND THE STATE. I THINK WE CAN SAY THAT FOR THE MOST PART IT'S BEEN SUCCESSFUL I THINK THE NUMBERS OF. REVENUE GENERATED IS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS IT'S ONE QUARTER OF ALL THE REVENUE GENERATED IN THE COUNTRY FROM TRIBAL GAMING THAT THAT HAPPENS HERE IN CALIFORNIA. WE'VE SEEN TRIBES MAKING INVESTMENT IN THEIR FACILITIES WHICH CREATES JOBS AND THEY'RE ALSO MAKING MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL INVESTMENTS IN THEIR COMMUNITIES SO IT'S NOT JUST. TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS THAT ARE BENEFITING BUT IT'S THE COMMUNITIES IN WHICH THOSE THOSE GAMING FACILITIES ARE LOCATED. BUT I THINK WE HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE SUCCESS IS NOT UNIFORM. THAT. THERE ARE HUNDRED NINE FEDERALLY RECOGNIZED TRIBES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FORTY NINE OF THEM DON'T DO ANY GAMING. TWENTY THREE A LIMITED GAMING OPERATIONS MEANING THEY HAVE LESS THAN THREE HUNDRED FIFTY SLOT MACHINES AND THEY MIGHT CHOOSE TO DO THIS. FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS WHETHER IT'S BECAUSE. THEY JUST DON'T FOR THEIR VALUES TO THE LARGER PRINCIPLES WANT ENGAGING GAMING OPERATIONS OR BECAUSE THEY'RE LOCATED. IN AN AREA WHERE THERE'S NO MARKET FOR THIS KIND OF ACTIVITY. BUT THE GOAL OF THE TRIBAL NATION GRANT FUND IS TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF THOSE SEVENTY TWO TRIBES AND ENSURE THAT THEY ARE ABLE TO AS THE PEOPLE ATTENDED BENEFIT FROM FROM TRIBAL GAMING. THE OUR STF WAS CREATED IN THE NINETEEN NINETY NINE COMPAQ'S WHICH. PROVIDES THAT ONE POINT ONE MILLION DOLLARS WILL GO TO EACH OF THOSE. ELIGIBLE TRIBES. IT. THAT AMOUNT HASN'T CHANGED IN FACT I CAN'T CHANGED IN THE COMPACT LANGUAGE ITSELF IT SPECIFIED THAT ANY MONEY THAT'S PUT INTO THE ICE T. F.. BEYOND WHAT'S REQUIRED TO MAKE THAT ONE POINT ONE MILLION. DB XIN MUST STAY IN THE FUND FOR FUTURE YEARS SO IT SIMPLY ISN'T AN OPTION TO TAKE THE ADDITIONAL REVENUE INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF THE DISTRIBUTION THROUGH THE US TO YEAH. AS. BUT CHAIRMAN INDICATED THE GRADING COMPAQ WAS THE FIRST ONE IN TWENTY TWELVE WHICH INCLUDED THE TRIBAL NATION GRANT FUND. IT IS GENERAL LANGUAGE AND THE INTENT WAS ALL ALONG TO ALLOW FOR IMPLEMENTING LEGISLATION. TO PROVIDE THE DETAILS OF HOW THAT THE PROCESS WOULD WORK TO ENSURE THAT THAT. THE MONEY GOT TO THE TRIBES IT NEEDED IT IN A WAY THAT WAS FAN HAVE LEGITIMACY IN THE EYES OF ALL STAKEHOLDERS. TO GET THINGS MOVING AND TWENTY SIXTEEN WE STARTED TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS WITH TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS AND THAT BECAME MORE INTENSE OF LAST YEAR. WE HAD A NUMBER OF CONSULTATIONS THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND. DEVELOPED DRAFT LANGUAGE WE RECEIVED A LOT OF FEEDBACK A LOT OF. HELPFUL COMMENTARY ON HOW TO MAKE IT BETTER AND WE PROVIDED THAT TO THE OTHER STAFF. WHICH IS WHAT IS NOW. AB EIGHT EIGHTY AND I WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT NONE OF US THINK THAT THE CURRENT LANGUAGE IS NECESSARILY PERFECT WE. WE WELCOME ALL IDEAS ON HOW TO MAKE IT BETTER WE JUST DON'T WANT UP PERFECT TO BE THE ENEMY OF THE GOOD IF THE MONEY. DOESN'T IF THERE ISN'T A MECHANISM TO GET THE MONEY OUT THE MONEY SITS AND THAT DOESN'T DO ANYBODY ANY GOOD SO WOULD LIKE TO NOW SHE'S PROVIDE A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF THE CURRENT. BILL PROCESS. FIRST OF ALL AND I THINK THIS IS PROBABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT ASPECT OF IT S THAT TRIBAL LEADERS WILL MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT. THE THE THE DETAILS OF THE AMOUNT IMPLEMENTATION THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THEY ARE JUST SIMPLY GOING TO BE MAKING THE DECISIONS ABOUT. AWARDING THE GRANTS ARE ALSO THE ONES WORKING WITH THE TRIBAL ADVISER WHO WILL ESTABLISH THE DETAILS OF THE PROCESS. THE BILL LAYS OUT CERTAIN IMPORTANT. PRINCIPLES SO THAT PEOPLE UNDERSTAND WHAT IT IS THAT THIS PROGRAM IS GOING TO BE BUT THERE LOT OF DETAILS AS THEIR TYPICALLY I LEGISLATION THAT ARE LEFT TO IMPLEMENTATION. HE'LL BE TRIBAL LEADERS WORKING WITH THE TRAVEL ADVISOR THAT WILL MAKE THOSE DECISIONS. AND. THAT. THE PROCESS IS A COMPETITIVE APPLICATION PROCESS THAT'S BECAUSE THE COMPAQ CLAIM WHICH REQUIRES THAT IT BE A COMPETITIVE APPLICATION PROCESS. THE. THE APPLICATION IS. IN THE. THE STATUTORY LANGUAGE INTENDED TO BE A CONCISE APPLICATION RECOGNIZE THAT THAT THESE ARE TRIBES THEY DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES TO SPEND A LOT OF MONEY ON GRANT WRITING. THE INTENT IS TO MAKE IT A CONCISE SIMPLE APPLICATION THAT PRESENTS THE INFORMATION THE DECISION MAKERS NEED. THE GAMMA CONTROL COMMISSION WILL PROVIDE THE ASSISTANCE AND AND PROCESSING THOSE AND PRESENTING INFORMATION TO DECISION MAKERS THE PURPOSE OF OF. THE THE GRANT IS. IS VERY BROAD IN OTHER WORDS. AT PRETTY MUCH ANY. PURPOSE RELATING TO SOLVE GOVERNMENTS DEVELOPING A SELF DETERMINED COMMUNITY AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IS WITHIN THE SCOPE OF WHAT'S PERMISSIBLE THE ONLY TWO AREAS WHERE. GRANT FUNDS CANNOT BE USED TO PRATAPADITYA ATTRIBUTIONS IN GAMING. OF THE BILL. STRIKE THE BALANCE I THINK BETWEEN TRANSPARENCY AND CONFIDENTIALITY THAT THE MEETINGS OF THE PALACE STEPPED BACK LOOKING OPEN MEETINGS ACT WITH THE PROVISION TO ALLOW FOR CLOSE SECTION. DISCUSSION OF THINGS WHICH I RELATE TO THE INTERNAL AFFAIRS OF TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS OR OTHERWISE SENSITIVE SUCH AS FINANCIAL. ACCOUNTABILITY AND TO ENSURE THAT THE MONEY IS USED FOR THE PURPOSES. FOR WHICH THE THE AND MONEY WITH SOCKS THE BUREAU OF GAMBLING THE TROLL WILL BE. ABLE TO DO. AUDITS OF OF THOSE. OF THOSE GRANT PROGRAMS AND IN A MANNER THAT'S CONSISTENT WITH GUIDANCE DEVELOPED BY BY THE PANEL. AND LIKE THE. REVENUE SHARING TRUST FUND THAT THE FUNDING FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS WILL COME FROM THE INDIAN GAMING SPECIAL DISTRIBUTION BUT. AS WE. HAVE WORKED THROUGH THE CONSULTATION PROCESS WITH. TRIBAL LEADERS THERE WERE A NUMBER OF CONCERNS WHICH ARE REYES EYES TWENTY SHARE THOSE WITH YOU NOW I'M SURE YOU'LL HEAR MORE LATER TODAY. THE FIRST WAS THAT THE PROGRAM IN THE TRIBAL NATION GRANT FUND IS DIFFERENT FROM THE REVENUE SHARING TRUST FUND THE REVENUE SHARING TRUST FUND IS IS BASED ON THE PRINCIPLE THAT. I THINK THAT. EACH TRIBE AS A SOVEREIGN TRIBAL NATION IS IS EQUAL TO EVERY OTHER TRIBE IN THAT THEY SHOULD GET THE SAME BENEFIT AND I AND I THINK WE RESPECT AND EMBRACE THAT'S THAT PRINCIPLE THAT'S WHY. THREAT THAT WE NEGOTIATIONS THAT THAT. RESULTED IN A TRIBAL NATION GRANT AND WE WE MADE IT CLEAR THAT THE. THE PRIMARY PURPOSE OF THE FUNDS THAT GO INTO THIS POT WILL BE TO DEFINE THE REVENUE SHARING TRUST FUND AND IT'S ONLY IF THERE. IS THAT FUND IS FULLY SOLVENT THAT THERE WOULD BE MONEY THAT GOES INTO THE TRIBAL NATION GRANT FUND THE THINKING BEHIND THE TRIBAL NATION GRANT FUND IS THAT. THAT. RATHER THAN A MARGINAL INCREASE AND FUNDING TO ALL THAT THAT. INFUSION AND THAT'S A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF FUNDS CAN MAKE IT MORE IMPACTFUL LONGER LASTING. IMPACT ON A COMMUNITY OF SUCH AS AN INVESTMENT HOUSING OR A HOSPITAL OR OTHER SORTS OF INFRASTRUCTURE MORE SO THAN A MARGINAL INCREASE IN THE REVENUE SHARING TRUST FUND. AND. THERE WERE CONCERNS ABOUT THE COMPETITIVE. ASPECT TO TO THE TRIBAL NATION GRANT FUND. WE AGAIN. HAVE TRIED TO RESPOND TO THAT. AND IN A WAY TO ENSURE THAT THE THAT. THE PROCESS IS IS IS SIMPLE AND. WELL AND THAT. APPLICATION IS COULD. YOU KNOW I I I SHOULD KNOW THAT IN RESPONSE TO THE CONCERNS ABOUT THE THE REVENUE SHARING TRUST FUND. BEING AVAILABLE TO ALL WE HAVE INCORPORATE LANGUAGE IN THE BILL WHICH WHICH. EMPOWERS THE PANEL TO DISTRIBUTE SOME BUT NOT ALL OF THE FUNDS TO. ALL. TRIBE THAT HAVE APPLIED IF THEY DETERMINE THAT TO BE THE THE MOST EFFECTIVE USE OF THOSE FUNDS AND WE BELIEVE THAT'S. AS FAR AS WE CAN GO BUT IT RESPONSE THIS CONCERNS AND STILL CONSISTENT WITH. THE COMPACT LANGUAGE THAT CONSTRAINS US. AND FINALLY I THINK IT WILL. THERE WERE. WERE SOME CONCERNS THAT THE INITIAL CONTACT THE GREAT COMPACT INCLUDED THE TRIBAL NATION GRANDSON BUT THAT THERE WAS NO. OUT REACH BEFORE THAT I THINK I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY NOT GOOD STATEMENT I THINK THAT'S JUST REFLECTS THE FACT THAT COMPAQ NEGOTIATIONS ARE CONFIDENTIAL RECENTLY HAD. WE CAN'T UNRING THAT BELL BUT WE'VE CERTAINLY DONE OUR BEST TO TO HAVE OUTREACH IN TERMS OF. OF WHAT THE FUND IS AND HOW WILL BE IMPLEMENTED. THE. THE FOCAL POINT WITHIN STATE GOVERNMENT FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF. THE TRIBAL NATION GRANT FUND WILL BE THE TRIBAL ADVISER I MEAN SHOULD BE WORKING WITH THE BEGAN TO CONTROL COMMISSION THE BJORK AND THE CONTROL. I SHOULD ACKNOWLEDGE THAT. OUTSTANDING WITH THAT IF YOU GOMEZ DID IS THE TRIBAL ADVISER TO GET US TO THIS POINT AND THAT WE'RE VERY GRATEFUL TO HAVE CRISTINA SNYDER. TAKING ON THESE RESPONSIBILITIES NOW AND SHE'S A GRADUATE OF UCLA YOU SLAY LAW SCHOOL SHE'S WORK AND TRIBAL ISSUES AND AND. WASHINGTON DC AND AND HERE IN THE STATE AND SHE IS A MEMBER OF THE TRACTOR AND OF HOW MY NATION SO WE'RE GRATEFUL TO HAVE FOR BRINGING ALL OF THAT. ISSUE AND OTHERS AND SO WITH THAT I'LL TURN IT OVER TO TRAVEL ADVISORS. THANK YOU. ACCEPTED THE RESPONSIBILITY OF SERVING AS TRIBAL ADVISER BECAUSE AS A MEMBER OF A CALIFORNIA TRY I CARE DEEPLY ABOUT THE ISSUES TROUBLING PEOPLE'S FACE THROUGHOUT THE STATE. AND WANTED TO BE A PART OF FACILITATING THE RELATIONSHIP OF MUTUAL RESPECT AND COLLABORATION BETWEEN. TWO SOVEREIGNS. WELL MULTIPLE SOVEREIGNS. I'M SOMEONE WHO'S INSPIRED BY CHALLENGES PARTICULARLY WHERE THE OBJECTIVE IS WORTHWHILE. GETTING ADDITIONAL FUNDS TO THE GOVERNMENTS OF THE REVENUE SHARING TRUST FUND ELIGIBLE TRIBES IS AN INCREDIBLY WORTHWHILE GOAL AND SOMETHING WORTH DOING RIGHT. WITH ADEQUATE TRIBAL AND PUT IT. I KNOW THAT THEIR TRIBES THAT SUPPORT THE TRIBAL NATION GRANT FUND AND OTHERS WHO HAVE SERIOUS CONCERNS. I'M COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH THE LEADERS FROM EACH OF THESE TRIBES TO IMPLEMENT THE TRIBAL NATION GRANT FUND IN A MANNER THAT IS FAIR EFFECTIVE RESPECTFUL AND CONSISTENT WITH THE APPLICABLE COMPAQ'S AND IMPLEMENTING REGULATIONS. AND LEGISLATION. I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT IMPLEMENTATION IN HALF. THANK YOU. THANK YOU PRE SHOULD. THE INTRODUCTION I THINK WE DO HAVE. SEVERAL QUESTIONS SHE MEMBERS. ALL BEGIN. BASKING GENERAL. I KNOW THE RECENT COMPAQ SADDAM. THE RESTRUCTURING THE PRINCIPLE THAT GAMING TRIBES SHOULD SHARE MORE REVENUE WITH LIMITED OR NON GAMING. IT WAS THIS PRECIPITATED BY A JUDICIAL RULINGS BUT WHAT WAS THE YOU KNOW. SERIES OF EVENTS. YES SIR SO I THURMOND KIND DECISION AS AS A NEED INDICATED WAS. ISSUED IN TWENTY TEN I THINK THAT I DROVE US TO TO RETHINK. HOW WE WOULD ENGAGE TRIBES IN OUR NEGOTIATIONS AYE I THINK A QUESTION THE? THE APPROACH OF OF HAVING. TRIBES CONTRIBUTE TO THE GENERAL FUND. WE'VE WE'VE FELT IN THE TRIBES HAVE AGREED THAT THEY SHOULD THOSE FUNDS THAT THAT THOSE TRIBES THAT. ARE ENGAGED IN GAMING. TO THE EXTENT THAT THEY CAN AND SHOULD SHARED THAT THE. THE SUCCESS THAT THEY'RE HAVING WITH OTHERS INCLUDING THOSE TRIBES THAT AREN'T SO. SO BLESSED WITH THE LOCATION OR FREEWARE OR YOU KNOW LARGE MEDIA POPULATIONS SO IT WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY. A JUDICIAL DECISION AND AND REVISITING OF OF OUR POLICY. JR COULD YOU ALSO ON. EXPLAIN HOW THE TRIBAL NATION GRANT FROM DIFFERS. FROM THE STF RELATING TO. TRIBES VERSUS DEAL WITH LOCAL IRRIGATION AND ARM COMMUNITY BENEFIT. TYPE THING YES SIR IT'S STILL ONE OF THE. THE FOR SPECIFIED USES OF THE. THE STF WAS FOR LOCAL MEDICATION AND AND. WHERE THERE WAS MONEY AVAILABLE AND AND RECENTLY THERE HAS BEEN MANY BUT IT WAS JUST SHOULD BE THROUGH LOCAL BENEFIT COMMITTEES FOR THE BENEFIT OF LOCAL JURISDICTIONS? THE THE BENEFICIARIES THEIR DAMNED WORD NON TRIBAL ENTITIES THEY WERE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS THAT THAT TRIBAL NATION GRANT FUND. IS. I THINK I'M A. ESSENTIALLY AN EVOLUTION A A REFINEMENT. OF THE REVENUE SHARING TRUST FUND THE BENEFICIARIES OF TRIBES. A IT IT'S MONEY THAT COMES FROM TRIBES FOR TRIBES TO AND THAT'S WHY THE APPROACH THAT WE'RE TAKING HERE. MIGHT BE DIFFERENT IN CERTAIN RESPECTS THEN ABOUT WHAT WAS DONE WITH THE STF WITH REGARD TO THE LOCAL BENEFIT COMMITTEES. BIGELOW. THANK YOU ON. TO DILLON. WHAT HAPPENS IF THE BILL IS NOT PASSED THIS LEGISLATIVE SESSION AND? ON THIS ISSUE. AND WHAT HAPPENS TO THE FUNDS THE MONEY JUST SITS THERE AND I I I I IT WOULD IT WOULD NOT GO TO THE BENEFIT OF OF THE TRIBES IF IT'S PLACED IN THE* TF. IT WOULD STAY IN THE US TF IT WOULD INCREASE THE AMOUNT THAT'S DISTRIBUTED TO THOSE TRIBES. AND THE SECOND. SINCE THE GREAT AND COMPACT TOO ALL THE CONTACTS INCLUDE PROVISIONS RELATED TO THE T. AND G. F.. IF SO WAS THERE MUCH PUSH BACK INCLUDING THOSE PROVISIONS DURING THE COMPACT NEGOTIATIONS. NO THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION ALL OF THE CONTACT THAT WE'VE NEGOTIATED INCLUDE TRIBAL NATION GRANT FUND PROVISIONS. WHEN. I AYE THAT. TRIBES UNDERSTAND THE POLICY OBJECTIVES WE'VE HAD DISCUSSIONS IN SOME OF OUR ONGOING NEGOTIATIONS ABOUT THE TRIBAL NATION GRANT FUND A LET THAT THE TRIBAL LEADERS WHO INVOLVED IN THOSE DISCUSSIONS TALK ABOUT THAT I MEAN CLEARLY THAT. THE CONTACTS THAT WE HAVE CONCLUDED TO THIS POINT. REFLECT AGREEMENT BY THE PARTIES TO THOSE COMPACTS THAT. THAT. THE THE PROVISIONS OF THIS COMPACT INCLUDING THE TRAVEL AGENT GRANT FINDER THINGS WHICH WE ALL SUPPORT. CAN AND MAYBE FINALLY. IT MIGHT BE A QUESTION THAT I CAN ASK YOU AND THEN THE TRIBES CAN BE PONDERING THIS QUESTION AS WELL. DID YOU SEE ANY ISSUES THAT MAY HAVE A ROSE THROUGH THE. THE ENTIRE PROCESS PROCESS LAST YEAR DURING OUR CONSULTATIONS. WHO WE WE HAVE WE TRY TO ADDRESS THOSE YOU KNOW FOR INSTANCE THAT'S WHY I WANTED TO GO? THROUGH THE LIST OF OF OF OF CONCERNS HAVE BEEN RAISED AND HOW WE'VE TRIED TO TO RESPOND I THINK. YEAH AGAIN I THINK THAT. THE CONCERNS A GENUINE AT AND AND WE HAVE. TRY TO IN GRAY ENGAGE ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS AND AND I THINK THERE'S A DEFINITE NEED. TO TRY TO GET. FUND ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO THE RCF ELIGIBLE TRIBES IN. I I BELIEVE THAT WE'VE GOT A LONG WAY TOWARDS ADDRESSING THIS CONCERN. IT MAY NOT BE PERFECT BUT I THINK IT. IT THE LEAST GIVES US SOMETHING TO START I THINK IT'LL BE IN GOOD HANDS AS FAR AS IMPLEMENTATION AND CERTAINLY WE CAN REVISIT ISSUES IF WE FIND THAT. DOWN THE ROAD THERE NEED TO BE SOME ADJUSTMENTS TO THAT THE BASIC FRAMEWORK SO UNDERSTANDING THAT COMPARTE A COMPONENT THAT LEADS ME. TO THE TO THE QUESTION OF. WHAT WE MAY HAVE AN ADMINISTRATION CURRENT? LEE IN PLACE THAT SUPPORTIVE IN EMBRACING OF THIS WHAT HAPPENS IF THE. AND THE NEXT ADMINISTRATION COMING AND HAS A LITTLE DIFFERENT THOUGHT PROCESS AND MAYBE ISN'T AS EMBRACING. HOW DOES THIS BINDER NOT BUYING THAT NEXT STEP? WELL I I THINK THAT THAT THE COMPACTS ARE A STATE THEY'VE BEEN OUR STATE LAWS EVEN RATIFIED IN PLACE OF GOVERNMENT TO GOVERNMENT AGREEMENTS THAT THAT BIND US I MEAN AND DOES COMPACTS. CREATE. THE REVENUE SHARING TRUST FUND IN THE TRIBAL NATION GRANT FUNDS THEY THEY HAVE THE THE THE PURPOSES AND LIMITATIONS THAT THOSE FUNDS HAVE SO ANOTHER WHICH WE CAN INCREASE. THE THE RCF BEYOND ONE POINT ONE MILLION AND THE WAY THE COMPACTS RIGHT NOW MONEY INTO THAT THAT'S IN THOSE COMPACTS THAT INCLUDE THAT TRIBAL NATION GRAPH AND WE'RE GOING TO THAT FUND TO BE AVAILABLE. THAT'LL BE BINDING ON ON WHOEVER SITS IN AND IN THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND AND I THINK THAT. THAT IT IS IMPORTANT TO TO. FOR LOTS OF REASONS ITHINK TO TO HAVE A VEHICLE THAT ALLOWS US TO MOVE THINGS FORWARD CONSISTENT WITH WHAT IS ALREADY STATE LAW. DE AND SO SO THAT'S WHY WE THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO GET THAT NOW TO MAKE SURE THAT THE MONEY JUST DOESN'T SIT THERE IT GETS OUT OF THE TRIBES THAT NEEDED. EXACTLY AND I THINK THAT'S A CONCERN OF EVERYONE TO MAKE SURE NO MATTER. WHO'S SITTING IN THESE CHAIRS IN THE FUTURE THE MONEY FOLLOWS WHAT WAS INTENDED FROM. THESE DAYS MOVING FORWARD SO THAT THEY'RE NOT. UTILIZED IN OTHER WAYS THAT MAYBE WEREN'T IN AGREEMENT. YES SIR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WE SHOULD GO IF YOU COULD DATA. OKAY AT THE CORE OF THIS LEGISLATION. AND THIS TOPIC IT SEEMS LIKE. I LIKE TO HEAR YOUR PERSPECTIVE ON RESPECTING SOVEREIGNTY RIGHT. AYE IN THESE NEGOTIATIONS BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY OR WHATEVER THE ULTIMATE OUTCOME OF LEGISLATION IS WE WANT TO MAKE SURE IT'S CRAFT IN SUCH A FASHION THAT WE. YOUR ACHIEVE THESE GOALS YOU FLAT OUT ABOUT THE SAME TIME. AB ABSOLUTELY WOULDN'T FRAMEWORK RESPECTING US ARMS COULD YOU GIVE ME YOUR PERSPECTIVE ON THAT. BUT YES SIR I THINK A BIG PART OF IT IS GOING TO BE THE ROLE THAT TRAVEL ADVISOR SNYDER PLAYS I MEAN THE REASON WHY. I THINK A LOT OF THE DETAILS HAVE BEEN. LEFT TO IMPLEMENTATION IS TO ENSURE THAT THE TRIBAL LEADERS WORKING WITH THE TRAVEL ADVISOR ABLE TO PUT THOSE DETAILS INTO PLACE THAT THAT RESPECTS I THINK. NOT THE LEGITIMATE INTERESTS OF OF ALL THE TRIBES IN THE STATE THAT WENT TO GENERATE CONTRIBUTE THE MONEY AND THE ONES WHO RECEIVE IT NOT TO HAVE A PROCESS THAT HAS LEGITIMACY IN THEIR EYES. SO THAT'S WHY WE. UP INTENDED TO HAVE LEGISLATION THAT. IT REFLECTED THE INPUT OF OF TRIBES IN THE STATE AND THAT'S WHY WE HAVE. WORKED HARD TO TRY DE GET THAT INPUT AND CLEARLY AT WE CAN'T TAKE EVERY INPUT INTO ACCOUNT IN THE BILL WITH THERE ARE CERTAIN CONSTRAINTS BUT BUT I THINK. I THINK IN MY MIND. IT'S THE AT RESPECTFUL ENGAGEMENT INCLUSION OF. OF TRIBAL LEADERS IN MAKING DECISIONS THAT FOR RESPECTS THEY'RE ON A LEGITIMATE ROLE IN THIS PROCESS. FORMERLY IT MY ROLES JUST GONNA BE TO FACILITATE THESE CONVERSATIONS BETWEEN SOVEREIGN LEADERS AND SO ON. YOU KNOW I THINK THAT THE WAY THAT THE LEGISLATION IS ALREADY DRAFTED RESPECTS THE IDEA THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE DISCUSSIONS THAT ARE. YOU KNOW. BEST LEFT TO BE BETWEEN SOVEREIGN LEADERS AND NOT FOR THE PUBLIC AND I THINK THAT THAT REALLY RESPECTS A LOT OF THE COMMENTS AND FEEDBACK THAT WE GOT PRIOR TO IT TO THE LEGISLATION BEING DRAFTED. BUT. I WOULD LIKE TO EMPHASIZE THAT MY ROLE IS NOT. AS PUPPETMASTER IT'S REALLY JUST BRINGING PEOPLE TOGETHER AND MAKING SURE THAT THEY ARE THEY ARE FOLLOWING THEIR OWN RULES AND THAT THERE ARE. RESPECTING THESE PRINCIPLES OF SOVEREIGNTY. I APPRECIATE THAT ARE CERTAINLY I THINK THE ADDITION OF THE PROVISION. BEFORE THE TRIAL ADVISER IN THE PLEDGE AND WAS A MAJOR STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. IN PROVIDING THAT FORUM WITH WHICH TO HAVE THOSE RESPECTFUL. DISCUSSIONS. SO. I APPRECIATE THAT ANSWER ANY OTHER ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS FROM THE MEMBERSHIP THIS TIME. SEEING THEN WHY DON'T WE GO AHEAD AND. THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATIONS AND AND MOVE ON TO ITEM FOR ON THE AGENDA. AND ASK. ALL OF THE PRESENTERS. TO. APPROACH TO DANCE AND PREPARE YOUR PRESENTATION WELCOME CHAIRMAN. GOOD MORNING. THANK YOU FOR HAVING US HERE. MY NAME IS SCOTT COZART NINE HAVE THE HONOR AND PRIVILEGE TO BE THE TROUBLE CHAIRMAN OF THE SUBURBAN BAND W. SANYO INDIANS. WE'RE LOCATED IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. AT THE FOOTHILLS OF THE SAN JACINTO MOUNTAINS AND ON THE BANKS OF THE SIGNS ON THE RIVER. THE SABAH TRIBE IS GOVERNED BY AN ELECTED FIVE MEMBER TRIBAL COUNCIL. AND WE OPERATE A CASINO UNDER THE NINETEEN NINETY NINE. TRIBAL STATE COMPACT GAMING COMPACT. TODAY. AS REPRESENTATIVES OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. YOU ARE HERE TO LISTEN AND HOPEFULLY TO LEARN. AS CHAIRMAN OF THE TRIBE I'M HERE TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THE VIEWS OF THE SUBURBAN TRIED. AND OUR OPPORTUNITIES FOR A BRIGHTER FUTURE. IF YOU CHAIR THAT REQUIRES A RENEWED. TRIBAL STATE GAMING COMPACT. PARTLY A COMPACT WITH MUTUALLY AGREED UPON TERMS THAT FURTHER ADVANCES. OUR SELF DETERMINATION. AND SELF GOVERNANCE NEEDS FAR INTO THE FUTURE. AS SUCH THE SOBELL LISSOUBA TRIBE APPRECIATES THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS THE JOINT COMMITTEE ON THE TRIBAL NATIONS GROUND FUN. WILL ALSO SUBMIT WRITTEN COMMENTS FOR THE FORMER RECORD AS WELL. THE TRIBE FIRMLY BELIEVES THAT THE LEGISLATURE MUST CLARIFY. THE PURPOSE AND EFFECT OF THE TNG OUT AND THERE'S INFORMATIONAL HEARING IS A GOOD START. OVERALL WE THINK IT IS PREMATURE TO ADVANCE ANY LEGISLATION REGARDING THE DISTRIBUTION OF TRIBAL GAMING FUNDS WITHOUT ADEQUATE CONSULTATION. AND CONSIDERATION OF THE MERITS OF ANY PROPOSED TNG F. IMPROVEMENT IMPLEMENTATION SCHEME. CONSULTATION AFTER THE FACT IS NOT CONSULTATION. AND WHETHER OR NOT THE TRIBE IS CURRENTLY A PARTY TO THE TN GF. THE SUBURBAN TRIBAL SEARCH OUR SOVEREIGN INTEREST IN THE CREATION OF A STATE BUREAUCRATIC ENTITY HOWEVER BENEVOLENT. THAT MAY IMPOSE OR INFRINGE ON OUR TRIBAL SOVEREIGNTY. SECOND THE SUBURBAN TRIBE HAS NO OBJECT OBJECTION TO SOME OF OUR TRIBAL GAMING REVENUES BEING DISTRICT DISTRIBUTED. TO THOSE IDENTIFIED ELIGIBLE TRIBES. IN FACT A TRIBALLY DRIVEN TRIBALLY CREATED. PROCESS TO DO JUST THAT WAS CREATED IN THE NINETEEN NINETY NINE COMPAQ. PROCESS KNOWN AS THE REVENUE SHARING TRUST FUND. AS SET FORTH IN THE NINETY NINE COMPAQ R. STF RECOGNIZES THE DESIRE OF THE CALIFORNIA TRIBES TO CREATE OPPORTUNITIES FOR ALL TRIBES IN THE STATE. DAR ES GEF CONCEPT WAS CREATED TO SHARE REVENUES WITH THOSE TRIBES LANDS OR CIRCUMSTANCES PROHIBITED SIZEABLE CASINOS. SINCE THE VERY BEGINNING THE SUBURBAN TRIBE HAS CONTRIBUTED TO THE RSC HAVE BOTH DIRECTLY IN THE FORM OF GAMING DEVICE LICENSES FEES. AND INDIRECTLY. THROUGH PAYMENTS UNDER THE SPECIAL DISTRIBUTION FUND SHORTFALL PROCESS. Q. TO OUR TRIBE SUPPORT TO THE RST F. WAS THE EQUITABLE DISTRIBUTION OF FUNDS TO THOSE IDENTIFIED ELIGIBLE TRIBES. SOME MOBILE TRIBE ALSO SUPPORTED EACH RECIPIENT TRIBE'S SOVEREIGN RIGHT. TO ASSESS ITS OWN NEEDS. AND SET ITS OWN PRIORITIES. OUR TRIBE WILL NOT SECOND GUESS OR MICRO MANAGE OTHER SOVEREIGNS TRIBAL PRIORITIES. AFTER HISTORY OF BROKEN PROMISES THE NEGLIGENCE BY BOTH THE FEDERAL AND STATE GOVERNMENTS THE SMOKE A TRIBE IS NOT GOING TO SUBSTITUTE OUR JUDGMENT OR ACT LIKE IT. PATERNALISTIC TRUSTEE OF THE OUR STF. INSTEAD WE ADVOCATE THAT SOVEREIGNTY IS A SOVEREIGNTY DEBTS. OVER THE YEARS WE HAVE RESPECTED EACH OF THE ELIGIBLE TRIBES RIGHTS AND WE CONTINUE TO DO THAT TODAY NO STRINGS ATTACHED TO THEIR SOVEREIGNTY. WHY IS THIS IMPORTANT IMPORTANT EXCUSE ME? WELL THE ENVISIONED TN. GEE UP PROCESS PUT SIMPLY IS PATERNALISTIC AT HIS VERY CORE. RATHER THAN SEEK LEGAL PATHWAYS TO EQUALLY DISTRIBUTE THOSE FUNDS AND THE ARTIST YOU HAVE OR SIMILAR TN G. UP PROCESS. THE SUGGESTED IMPLEMENTATION PLANS SEEK TO DIVIDE ELIGIBLE TRIBES CREATING COSTLY COMPETITION AND PREDICTABLE INEQUITY. IN ADDITION THE TNG F. PROCESS MAY CREATE A CUMBERSOME AND COMPLICATED ADMINISTRATIVE BUREAUCRACY. A NEW BRIATORE SEE DOES NOT. PENSKE'S MEN NEW BUREAUCRACY NOT SEEN IN INDIAN COUNTRY. SINCE THE FEDERAL CREATION OF THE BUREAU OF INDIAN AFFAIRS. TO BE CLEAR THIS MOBILE TRIBAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE FOR THE FEDERAL BUREAUCRACY OUR TRUSTY. IS NOT ONE WE SEEK TO MIRROR. AT THE STATE LEVEL. WE ARE NOT LOOKING TO CREATE A MANY BE AYE. AT THE STATE AND QUITE FRANKLY THE STATE SHOULD WANT TO EITHER. SIMPLY PUT ANY INSERTION OF A SAVINGS CLAUSE. AND LEGISLATION TO DISAVOW A TRUST RELATIONSHIP WITH THE TRIBE. IN THAT ADMINISTRATION OF THE TNG F. WILL NOT RELEASED THE STATE FROM RESPONSIBILITY OR ACCOUNTABILITY. THAT'S GIVEN THE HISTORICAL FAILURES OF THE FEDERAL AND STATE GOVERNMENTS TO FULFILL THE PURPOSE AND INTENT OF THE TREATIES THE CONSTITUTION AND STATUTES. THE SUBURBAN DRIVE SIX A STREAMLINED APPROACH TO THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE TNG UP. BY REDUCING THE TIME AND MONEY SPENT ON A LENGTHY BUREAUCRATIC PROCESS. FOR DESPITE OUR SUCCESS THE SUBURBAN TRIBE NOT UNLIKE VIRTUALLY EVERY TRIBE IN THE NATION INCLUDING OUR AS. ANTI NGF ELIGIBLE TRIBES CONTINUES TO NEED MORE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT INFRASTRUCTURE HOUSING EDUCATION. JUDICIAL SYSTEMS HEALTHCARE AND SOCIAL SERVICES. THE ECONOMIC NEED INTO COUNTRY IS SELF EVIDENT THEREFORE ELABORATE DISTRIBUTION PROCESS IS NOT NECESSARY. RATHER WE BELIEVE THE TNG AFTER SUBMISSION PROCESS PROCESS SHOULD REMAIN SIMPLE AND INEXPENSIVE LIKE OUR STF PROCESS. FURTHER IT SHOULD REMAIN FAIR AND EQUITABLE THE SHOULD BE DISTRICT DISTRIBUTED ON A PREDICTABLE SCHEDULE FOR PLANNING AND THE SHOULD BE SPENT ON TRAVEL BATES PRIORITIES. IN CLOSING OUR RESERVATION THE. ON OUR RESERVATIONS OVER TRIBE HAS CREATED A LOCAL ECONOMY. DESPITE THE LOSS OF THE RESERVATION ON WATER SUPPLY FOR DECADES. THE HISTORICAL WRONGS HAVE MADE THIS MOBILE PEOPLE STRONGER AND BETTER PREPARED TO FACE THE NEXT CHALLENGE SHORT TRAVEL SOVEREIGNTY. BUT THE SUBURBAN TRIBAL COUNCILS QUESTS ISABEL WELL BEYOND SIMPLY BEING ABLE TO OPEN BUSINESSES AND CREATE JOBS. RATHER THE TRIBAL STRENGTHEN OUR COMMUNITIES BY ADVANCING THE OVERALL WELL BEING OF OUR PEOPLE. INCLUDING OUR SISTER CALIFORNIA TRIBES. WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE JOINT COMMITTEE TO FIND A WORKABLE SOLUTION. ONCE AGAIN THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK OUT AGAINST LOCAL WILL SUBMIT WRITTEN TESTIMONY. THANK CHAIRMAN. GOOD MORNING. MY NAME'S DAN ALSO GOTTA I'M THE CHAIRMAN OF THE EQUIPMENT OF INDIANS ALSO THE CHAIRMAN OF THE. CT A SEED TO CONTACTED TRIBE STEERING COMMITTEE WHICH IS ABOUT COMPRISE ABOUT TWENTY TRIBES. ORIGINALLY AS ESTABLISH THE NINETEEN NINE NINE COMPAQ'S. IT UNION RIGIDLY THE NINE AYE COMPACT ESTABLISHED THE. THERE ARTIST YOU HAVE REGIONALLY ENDING HAS CONTINUED EVER SINCE YOU KNOW THAT EVERY TRIBE OPERATING THREE IN A FIFTY FIVE THREE ARE PRETTY DEVICES. IS ELIGIBLE FOR THE ONE POINT ONE MILLION DOLLARS. ANY SURPLUSES TO BE ROLLED OVER TO SUBSEQUENT YEARS IF THERE'S A SHORTFALL. THAT IS TO BE MADE UP BY THE STF OR OTHERWISE THE AMOUNT OF THE AS FAR AS TO HAVE IS TO BE DISTRIBUTED TO ALL ELIGIBLE TRIBES IN EQUAL SHARES. AS OUR STATE IS CURRENTLY ESTABLISHED THERE'S NO MECHANISM FOR DISTRIBUTING ANY SURPLUS AND IN THE RTF UNTIL NOW. THERE HAS NOT BEEN AN ISSUE BECAUSE OUR STF WAS IN A PERPETUAL SHORTFALL. BUT NEWT BUT THE NEW BROWN ADMINISTRATION COMPACTS WHICH HAVE A LIMITED LIMITED. THE GAMING DEVICE LICENSING SYSTEM THAT WAS PRIMARY SOURCE FOR FINDING GARCIA. HAVE CREATED A STRONG LIKELIHOOD THAT THERE'S A SURPLUS IN OURS. AND OURS JEFF IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. THE US IS. THE PROFESSOR PURPOSES OF THE T. NGF IS TO CREATE A MECHANISM FOR DISTRIBUTING ANY SURPLUS AND AND ARTIST YOU HAVE RATHER THAN ROLLING OVER THE MONIES. FOR FUTURE YEARS BY SPILLING ANY SURPLUS AND TO THE G. NGF IN AWARDING GRANTS TO RCF ELIGIBLE TRIBES. THE STATE HASN'T IDENTIFIED WHICH TRIBES IF ANY HAD ANY INPUT. IN THE CONCEPT OF THE TNG F. OR THE FOR GOING CONTACT LANGUAGE IT FIRST APPEARED IN THE GRAIN COMPACT. BUT WITHOUT THE SPILLOVER LANGUAGE. THAT WAS ADDED LATER. IN LATER COMPLEX INSTANCES BEEN AMENDED TO THE GREEN COMPACT. HOWEVER NO BURKE BROWN ADMINISTRATION COMPAQ SPELLS OUT THE PROCESS OR CRITERIA. BY WHICH GRANTS ARE TO BE AWARDED OR BY WHOM GRANT APPLICATIONS ARE TO BE REVIEWED AND APPROVED. OR HOW OR BY WHOM GRANT REVIEWERS APPROVE OR APPROVALS ARE TO BE SELECTED. AS ORIGINALLY INTRODUCED. AB AT CONFLICTING TAINT KNOW MORE DETAILS THAT ARE CONTAINED IN THE VARIOUS COMPACTS THAT REFER TO THE TNG ERA. THE STATE PREPARED CONCEPTUALIZE OF HOW THE T. NGF WOULD. BE ADMINISTERED BUT THE PROPOSAL WAS MET BY STRONG OPPOSITION FROM A SIGNIFICANT. NUMBER OF OUR FIRST YOU HAVE ELIGIBLE TRIBES AND VARYING DEGREES OF SUPPORT FROM OTHER TRIBES. THE COMPAQ STEERING COMMITTEE. CONSISTENT ABOUT TWENTY TWENTY MEMBER TRIBES. IS STRONGLY OPPOSED. AB AT HAS BEEN AMENDED TO FLESH OUT SOME OF THE DETAILS OF HOW THE T. NGF WOULD WORK. THE AMENDMENTS ADDRESS SOME BUT ONLY A RELATIVELY FEW OF THOSE PROVISIONS DEEMED. MOST UNACCEPTABLE TO BY NEARLY ALL TRIBES IS THAT FOR THOSE THAT ENDORSED THE JINJA. FOR EXAMPLE THE BILL NO LONGER GRANTS MATERIALS SUBJECT TO DISCLOSURE ON THE PUBLIC RECORDS ACT AND NO LONGER REQUIRES RECIPIENT TRIBES TO WEIGH THE SOVEREIGN IMMUNITY WHICH WE APPRECIATE THESE AMENDMENTS. HOWEVER CONTINUES TO CONTEMPLATE COMPETITIVE PROCESS FOR GRANTS FOR LIMITED RANGE OF PURPOSES JUST. SORRY DOES DIRECTLY LIMITING TRIES RIGHT TO SELF DETERMINATION AND ALSO REQUIRES OUGHT TO BE CONDUCTED. DESPITE ITS LIMITATIONS GARCIA HAS HAD FOUR PRIMARY VIRTUES FOR ELIGIBLE TRIBES. FIRST USED THE DISTRIBUTION PROCESS WAS SIMPLE TO ADMINISTER. SECOND ALL THOSE CAPPED AT ONE POINT ONE MILLION DOLLARS EACH TRIBE RECEIVED AN EQUAL AMOUNT AND US ALLOCATIONS ARE FAIR AND EAT. A TO ALL ELIGIBLE TRIBES. THIRD AS YOU SEE IT OF THE DISTRIBUTIONS. IS PREDICTABLE. ENABLING RECIPIENT TRIBES TO PLAN FOR THE RECEIPT OF THE FUNDS. AND THE USE OF THOSE FUNDS. FINALLY IT RESPECTS THE RIGHT OFEACH RECIPIENT TRIBE TO SET ITS OWN PRIORITIES AND DETERMINE HOW BEST TO MEET ITS OWN NEEDS WITH NO STRINGS ATTACHED AND HOW THE FUNDS ARE TO BE SPENT. OTHER THAN CREATING A MECHANISM BY WHICH THE SURPLUS AN ARTIST YOU HAVE CAN BE DISTRIBUTED. RATHER THAN ROLLING OVER FREE FUTURE YEARS. THE PROCESS PROPOSED BY ABA EIGHTY DOES NOT PRESERVE ANY OF THE VIRTUES OF THE RCF. AND IF THE TNG EFFORTS TO DISTRIBUTE MONIES BY AWARDING GRANTS ON THE COMP UNCOMPETITIVE BASES. FOR SPECIFIED PURPOSES AS DETERMINED BY CUMBERSOME AND COMPLICATED ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESS THOSE VIRTUES CAN'T BE PRESERVED. FOR EXAMPLE. THE QUEEN RESTORATION CONSISTS OVER NINETEEN THOUSAND ACRES LOCATED IN THAT NEAR TOWN OF ANZA IN A FAIRLY REMOTE AND. LIGHTLY POPULATED. AREA GROUPS SAY COUNTING THAT'S NOT EASY TO GET TO. ALTHOUGH WE OFFERED TO SMOGGY GAMING FACILITY. THEY CANNOT GENERATE ANYTHING CLOSE TO WHAT THE TROUBLE GOVERNMENT IN THE RESERVATION COMMUNITY NEEDS AND. WAY PROGRAMS IN INFRASTRUCTURE. ALTHOUGH BLESSED WITH MORE LAND THAN MANY CALIFORNIA TRIBES THE CREW RESERVATIONS ROADS AREN'T PAVED. IT DOESN'T HAVE A COMMUNITY WATER SEWAGE SYSTEM MUCH OF THE RESERVATION HOUSE DOG COULD USE IMPROVEMENT AND THE RESERVATION RESIDENTS. HAVE TO TRAVEL FAR FOR MANY GOOD FOR MANY GOOD SERVICES AND EMPLOYMENT. THE QUIZ SITUATION IS NOT UNIQUE CRITICALLY AMONG TRIBES THAT ARE NOT LOCATED NEAR MAJOR POPULATION CENTERS OR NEAR MAJOR HIGHWAYS. THAT'S WHY KOREA AMONG MANY OTHER TRIBES HAS BEEN AND WILL LIKELY RETURN WILL REMAIN. ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE DISTRIBUTIONS FROM THE OURS TIA. WHO'S A MEMBER OF THE. OF THE COMPLEX DURING COMMITTEE. A COALITION OF TWENTY TRIED TO HAVE BEEN JOINED TOGETHER TO NEGOTIATE REPLACEMENTS. MOST OF THE CDS THE CHARGES ARE ELIGIBLE FOREST YES. DISTRIBUTIONS AND AGREE THAT ANY SURPLUS IN RCF SHOULD BE DISTRIBUTEDTO ALGEBRA BILLS WILL TRIBES IN EQUAL SHARES. AS A SURPLUS THE CRUISE RATHER THAN SIMPLY ROLLING THEM OVER FOR FUTURE YEARS. WHICH ARE CURRENT COMPAQ SEATS. ALTHOUGH CUI WAS NOT CONSULTED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE CONCEPT WITH TNG HAVE WE UNDERSTAND THE MAIN PURPOSE IS TO PROVIDE A MEANS FOR DISTRIBUTING RSTS. SURPLUS RATHER THAN ROLLING OVER. HOWEVER QUEER ALONG WITH THE REST THE CTS THE TRIBES OPPOSE GREATNESS SYSTEM WHICH TRIBES MUST COMPETE FOR GRANTS. TO BE AWARDED BY A BUREAUCRACY EVEN IF. ONE ELECTED AMONG TRIBAL LEADERS THOUGH HOW THE POWER TOWARD MONEY BASED ON A SUBJECTIVE JUDGMENTS. ABOUT WHICH TRIED NEEDS AND PRIORITIES ARE MORE URGENT AND LEGITIMATE AND OTHER TRIBES. VIRTUALLY EVERY ARTIST YET BILLS WHICH I'VE HAS MAJOR. AND IMMEDIATE NEEDS RATHER. WHETHER THEY LACK. ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES IF STRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT INADEQUATE LAND BASE HOUSING EDUCATION JUDICIAL SYSTEM OF. EDUCATION HEALTHCARE SOCIAL SERVICE AND ALL THE OTHER THINGS THAT PEOPLE. NEED AND EXPECT FROM THE GOVERNMENT'S. THIS WILL MAKE ESTABLISHING GRANT CARTERI IN EXCEEDINGLY DIFFICULT AND INQUISITIVE IN UNNECESSARY TESTS. FOR ONE EXAMPLE IN. THE TRIBE WITH A LARGE. BUT REMOTE LAND BASE AND RELATIVELY SMALL POPULATION HAVE A GREATER NEEDS IN A REMOTELY LOCATED DRIVE WITH THE SMALL AND BASS IN A RELATIVELY LARGE POPULATION. CALIFORNIA'S TRIBES AND RESERVATION COMMUNITIES ARE TOO DIVERSE. FOR ANY IT AND SEE ALSO ANY ENTITY EXTERNAL TO THE TRIBE ITSELF TO WAY ONCE TRIED CERTAIN DANCE IS AGAINST ANOTHER. FOR THESE REASONS QUEER SUGGESTED THE TNG ERA RESTRUCTURED SO OF RESERVES WHAT WE REGARD AS THE GREATEST VIRTUES OF THEIR* CHIA. THE DISTRIBUTION PROCESS BE OF SIMPLE TO ADMINISTER. IT SHOULD BE FAIR TO ALL ELIGIBLE TRIES MEANING EACH RECIPIENT TRIBE SHOULD RECEIVE THE SAME OUT WHEN THE FUNDS ARE DISPUTE JUST DISPERSED. SCHEDULE FOR MAKING JUST RESTAURANTS SHOULD BE PREDICTABLE ENABLE ENABLING RECIPIENT TRIBES TO PLAN FOR THE RECEIPT AND USE OF FUNDS. THE RIGHT OF EACH IT RECIPIENT TRIBE TO SET ITS OWN NEEDS A PARTY SHOULD BE RESPECTED. THE ONLY APPLICATION SHOULD BE TIMELY SUBMISSION OF A LETTER DOCUMENT THE TRIBES ELIGIBILITY REQUESTS DISBURSEMENT OF EQUAL SHARES OF T. NGF. DISBURSEMENTS. HAD THERE BEEN MEANINGFUL CONSULTATION WITH THE ALIFORNIA TRIES WHEN TINA JEFF WAS BEING CONCEIVED. THE TASK OF DEVISING AN APPROPRIATE STRUCTURE WOULD HAVE BEEN MUCH EASIER LESS CONTROVERSIAL. HOWEVER. WE APPRECIATE THE GEO. CHAIRS EFFORTS TO FIND A FAIR AND WORKABLE SOLUTION TO SITUATION NOT THEIR OWN MAKING. I'LL BE HAVE A QUEER AND THE CDS MEMBER TRIBES APPRECIATE YOUR TIME AND LOOK FOR DISMISSING AND DEVELOPING THE SOLUTIONS. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON. I'M CHAIRMAN WHY NOT THE SECOND TICKET ENTRANCE REAL I'M NOT GOING TO READ. MY ENTIRE LETTER AS CHAIRMAN DANIEL. AIRPORT OUR OPPOSITION IS ALMOST IDENTICAL AND WITH. WHAT WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE? WITH THE WAY THE TEAM JEFF. GOES ON SALINAS READ THIS A LITTLE PART OF IT. I'M RUNNING FOR THE. I'M RUNNING TO THE STATE MY TRIBAL COUNCILS OPPOSITIONS THE TROUBLE NATION'S GRANT FUND. AND THE PAST PASSES OF AB EIGHT EIGHTY. THE TRIBE IS A FEDERAL FEDERALLY RECOGNIZED INDIAN TRIBE ORGANISE EYES. ORGANIZED UNDER A WRITTEN CONSTITUTION WHICH DELEGATES A CHICKEN RANCH TRIBAL COUNCIL AS A GOVERNMENT BODY OF THE TRIBE. THE TRIBE IS A BENEFICIAL OWNER THE CHICKEN RANCH INDIAN RESERVATION LOCATED ATOMIC COUNTY CALIFORNIA. THE TRIBE IS ALSO THE OWNER AND OPERATOR OF A SMALL CASINO THE CONSISTS OF THREE HUNDRED FORTY NINE GAMING DEVICES. THE TRIBE IS PART OF THE COMPACT DRIVE STEERING COMMITTEE THAT IS CURRENTLY IN THE COMPAQ NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE. I AM WRITING TO INFORM HIM THAT THE TRIBE OPPOSES THE INCLUSION OF THE OF THE TNG OF AND THE TRIBES COMPACT. AND THE PASSES OF A BAT FOR ALL THE REASONS SET FORTH IN THE CTS HE'S LETTER DATED. AUGUST ELEVENTH TWENTY SEVENTEEN TO CHAIRMAN GREG. SO. WITHOUT. I LOOK FORWARD. TWO ALTHOUGH. PROPOSITIONS AND I SAID. TERMS AGO KNOWN GERMAN DANIEL. WITHOUT WOULD LIKE SEE. THE TEAM JEFF CALLED EVENLY TOURISTS THE TRIBES SO I DON'T WANT TO WASTE ANY. MORE GUYS THIS TIME THANK YOU SO MUCH. HELLO. I'M THE TROUBLE CHAIRMAN FOR THE COUNTY VALLEY BAND OF POMO INDIANSAND ALSO THE CHAIRMAN FOR UNITED POLLINATION COUNCIL. WHICH CONSIST OF SIXTEEN TRIBES IN LAKE MENDOCINO CINEMA COUNTIES. ALL THOSE TRIBES WILL MOST LIKELY QUALIFY OTHER THAN ONE FOR THE TRIBAL NATIONS GRAND FUN. WE HAVE TWO OFFICIAL STANCES. THE FIRST IS MITCHELL STATUS IF IT'S GOING TO BE A GRANT PROCESS. IS THAT THE TRIBAL LEADERS DECIDE. WHAT TRIED WILL BE AWARDED THOSE DOLLARS? WE KNOW OUR COMMUNITY BETTER THAN ANYBODY ELSE SO THAT. THAT WAS A BIG ONE FOR US BUT ALSO. SECOND OFFICIAL PLEASED WE JUST MET YESTERDAY WAS. NO MATTER WHAT DIFFERENCES WE MAY HAVE IN OUR COMMUNITIES OUR TRIBAL COMMUNITIES OR THE POLITICS YOU HAVE WHEN YOU'RE AND. THAT WE'VE WE ASK DON'T MATTER WHAT. THAT THIS BILL GET PASSED THIS YEAR. WE HAVE TRIBES THAT ARE SUFFERING LIKE YOU WILL NEVER EVER SEEN IN YOUR LIFE. IN YOUR LIFE. IF YOU GUYS WERE TO VISIT SOME OF THE RESERVATIONS THAT I HAVE WITNESSED. IT'S VERY SAD. VERY SAD. NOW AS THE CHAIRMAN OF THE KIND OF ALL THE BAND OF POMO INDIANS. MY POSITION IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT THAN MY COLLEAGUES THAT SIT HERE WITH ME. I HAVE. LET ME GIVE A A LITTLE BACKGROUND ABOUT COYOTE VALLEY. THROUGH NEW MARKET TAX CREDITS. THROUGH THE LOW INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDITS THROUGH FEDERAL GRANTS. AND SELF FUNDING. BY THE END OF TWO THOUSAND AND NINETEEN. WE ILL BUILD BUILDING A SMALL NEW CASINO. THREE HUNDRED FORTY NINE GAMES. WE WILL BE WILL BUILDING HUNDRED A ONE HOTEL ROOM. WE JUST REMODELED THIRTY BRAND NEW HIGH BRED TO PRACTICALLY BRAND NEW HUD HOMES. WE WOULD BUILDING THIRTY NEW HOMES. WE WILL BUILDING OUR NEW INFRASTRUCTURE FOR ON WASTE IN OUR OWN WATER. AS WE ALL KNOW THAT THE STRUGGLE. CITIES. WE'RE DOING THAT. ONLY BECAUSE. S. COMPETITIVE GRANTS ARE AVAILABLE LARGE AMOUNTS. CANNOT BUILD. THE GYMNASIUM. YOU CANNOT BUILD A NEW TROUBLE GOVERNMENT OFFICE. YOU CAN EVEN BUILD ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OR ROADS. IF WE DISTRIBUTE THE MONIES EVENLY. NOW THIS IS AGAINST. MY OWN TRIBE. IT'S NOT THE BENEFIT OF MY TRIBE TO SAY WHAT I'M SAYING. IF YOU DISTRIBUTED EVENLY TO THE RCF. QUALIFICATIONS IF YOU WILL. MY TRIBE AND POLITICALLY. I'VE CONSTITUENTS AT HOME THAT I GOT ANSWERED TO. WANT TO KEEP THE MONEY. WHICH MEANS THE TRIBES THAT HAVE NO GAMING ZERO GAMING. HAVE NO LEVERAGE NO COLLATERAL TO BUILD ANYTHING OR NO LEVERAGE EVEN QUALIFY FOR OTHER GRANTS THAT ARE OUT THERE LIKE THE LOW INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDITS AVAILABLE TO US. THEY WILL BUILD TO BUILD A COMMUNITY. SO AS A TROUBLE CHAIRMAN. IT'S REALLY HARD FOR ME TO. BELIEVE THAT'S IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF INDIAN COUNTRY IN CALIFORNIA. FOR COMEDY VALLEY TO. GET A LITTLE EXTRA MONEY. WHEN I HAVE TRIBES THAT ARE SUFFERING NEXT DOOR TO ME. STRUGGLING. NO WATER. NO WAY SYSTEMS. NOT EVEN A JAM. THE GOVERNMENT BUILDINGS ARE FALLING APART. FOR ME TO TAKE MONEY. I PUT MYSELF FIRST. I WOULD FEEL AS IF I WAS LETTING MY COMMUNITY DOWN MY INDIAN COMMUNITY DOWN. NEST NO DISRESPECT MY COLLEAGUES HERE OR ANYBODY ELSE OR ANY OTHER TRIBAL LEADERS THAT ARE SPEAKING. IT'S. DIFFERENCE WE LIVE IN DIFFERENT AREAS POSSIBLY. AND WHEN YOU'RE THE CHAIRMAN OF SIXTEEN TRIBES. AND MORE THAN HALF OF TRIBES HAVE. VERY LITTLE. IT'S VERY HARD. TO SAY. THE SMALL GAME TRIBE GIVE ME MY SHARE BECAUSE IT'S EASIER. TRIBES HAVE THRIVED WE HAVE TRIED CUT ABOUT THIS THRIVED ON THE GRANT PROCESS. BECAUSE WHEN THERE'S MORE MONEY AVAILABLE AND IT'S COMPETITIVE. YOU COULD DO A BIGGER THINGS. WE ALL KNOW THAT'S WHY WE'RE CONSIDERING THE GRANT PROCESS. IF YOU DISTRIBUTE EVENLY WHAT CAN YOU BUILD. WHAT CAN YOU HONESTLY DEVELOP? NOTHING. SO ONCE AGAIN WILL BE LEFT PLEASE TRY TO HAVE ZERO WILL BE LEFT STRUGGLING. NOW SOME OF THE TRIBES THAT HAVE ZERO WITH THE NOTES DISTRIBUTED EVENLY BECAUSE. THEY'RE AFRAID THAT THEY MIGHT NOT HAVE THE. STAFF TO QUALIFY FOR A GRANT. THAT MIGHT BE A POSSIBILITY. BUT IF WE NEVER OFFER A TRY FOUR FIVE MILLION SIX MILLION TO DEVELOP SOMETHING. THAT'S GOING TO LAST A COMMUNITY FOR THIRTY YEARS WHAT'S THE POINT OF THE TRIBAL NATIONS GRAB FUN. I AGREE THAT IT SHOULD NOT GO TO PER CAPITA. BUT ALSO. DISAGREE THAT IT SHOULD BE DISTRIBUTED EVENLY WE HAVE SO MANY TRIED STRUGGLING THAT DON'T HAVE ANYTHING. AND ASK YOU. TO. POSSIBLY PUT POLITICS ASIDE. AND ASK YOURSELVES IF YOU WERE. A TRIBAL CHAIRMAN OF A RESERVATION THAT HAD NOTHING. WOULD YOU RATHER HAVE FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND. MAYBE EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND. OR WOULD YOU RATHER BILL THE GYMNASIUM ERECT RECREATIONAL CENTER FOR YOUR PEOPLE. WHICH YOU BROTHER BILL THIRTY HOMES LIKE WE ARE FOR YOUR PEOPLE. WE CAN'T LET THE FEAR. OF THOSE OF THE GRANT PROCESS HOLD US BACK WE JUST CAN'T. YOU HAVE TO WE TRIBES KNOW HOW TO FIGHT FOR MONEY. THE FIGHT HALF A MILLION IS A FIGHT FOR NOTHING. YOU CAN DO ANYTHING WITH IT. SO I ASK YOU JUST TO TAKE UNDER CONSIDERATION YOU TO PUT YOURSELF IN MY SHOES DOT. WHOEVER ALSO SHOES IF YOU WILL TO BUT. GOETHE TRIBES AN SEE AND ASK AND AND LOOK AROUND TO SEE IF THEY COULD BUILD ANYTHING WITH THAT. MIDDLEMAN A MONEY. SO THAT BEING SAID THAT'S JUST. MY POSITION THE TRIBAL CHAIRMAN FOR KIND OF IDENTICAL INDIANS AND I HAD A JOB JUST AND MY AUNT WOULD ALWAYS. MY AUNT AFTER SHE WOULD GIVE ME A LASSEN SHOULD END WITH THE JOKE. MR SO TO TALK THE NEXT DAY I GUESS. BUT THE. I ALWAYS SAY YOU DO YOU KNOW HOW CAN THE UNITED STATES WERE THE FIRST PEOPLE ON THE MOON. BECAUSE THEY HEARD INDIANS HAVE LAND UP THERE. THAT'S MY JOKE OF THE DAY. I APPRECIATE YOU AND I REALLY DO THINK THE GOVERNOR AND THE TRIBES ARE CONTRIBUTING TO THE TRAVEL AGENTS CRAP FUND. AND I THINK WE SHOULD RESPECT WHAT THE TRIBES THAT CONTRIBUTE TO THE TRIAL MISSION GRANT FUND. THERE THAT WHAT THEY WANT FOR THEIR COMMUNITY AFTER CONTRIBUTE TO THANK YOU. THANK YOU ARE CHAIRMAN THANK YOU ALWAYS GOOD TO HAVE SOME LEVIY. THE IF IN HIS DISCUSSIONS WITH THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR PRESENTATIONS AND. YOUR THOUGHTFUL APPROACH TO. WHAT I THINK IS AN INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT ISSUE? ON. YOU PROVOKE SOME THOUGHT AS I. IT'S IN HERE LISTENING TO TESTIMONY ON. IT WE WILL WE'VE RAISED ISSUES. RELATED MY COMMENTS ON ON. SOVEREIGNTY AND HOW DO WE AND WE PRESERVE PROTECT AND RESPECT THAT. TO THE UTMOST DEGREE AND CERTAINLY. WE'VE MADE SOME AMENDMENTS TO THE LEGISLATION. WE'VE TRIED HAVE ADEQUATE. PUBLIC REVIEW INCLUDING OBVIOUSLY TODAY'S OPPORTUNE DISCUSSES ISSUE IN SOME DETAIL HERE FROM YOURSELVES AND. AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS AND I INTERESTED PARTIES. I KNOW THERE WAS SEVERAL. TRIBAL CONSULTATION CONSULTATIONS HELD THROUGHOUT THE STATE. AND I ASSUME SOME OF THE FOLKS HERE PROBABLY PARTICIPATED. I IN THOSE IN REDWOOD VALLEY AND. PAULA ON TRINIDAD SACRAMENTO. ON THE OPPORTUNITIES TO DISCUSS THIS ISSUE BUT. THE THE THOUGHT WHILE MY MIND IS YOU KNOW WE WE RAISE THE ISSUE OF EQUITY. INTERESTING BECAUSE IS THE THE CHAIRMAN. A GREATER VALUE RAISES IN EQUITY CAN BE VIEWED A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT WAYS. AND AND IN SOME RESPECTS FROM EQUAL DISTRIBUTION. THAT PROHIBITS FOLKS FROM. ENGAGING IN SOME WAYS ARE DIRECTED HIS THAT'S AN EXCELLENT. A POINT THAT MAYBE YOU COULD WALK US THROUGH I THINK ON. WHEN YOU HIT ON THE ISSUE OF INEQUITY HAD HOW DO YOU SEE A CHAIRMAN. AS RELATES COULD YOU ILLUSTRATE SOME EXAMPLES. OF HOW THE SYSTEM MIGHT GO AWRY IN YOUR MIND BASED ON YOUR COMMENTS. OFF-AGAIN. BUT TO BOTH. THE GERMAN WOMAN ON THE RIGHT SIDE THE TO HIT HER YEAH. DANGER RATHER. INEQUITY OF. WHOM IN DID IN THOSE CONSULTATIONS. PART OF THAT BUREAUCRATIC PROCESS THAT WAS BEING DISCUSSED. JUST HAS NO THOSE POLITICS HERE DOES POLITICS IN TRIBES IN AT THE SACRAMENTO CONSULTATION THERE WAS SOME OF THAT WAS BROUGHT OUT YOU KNOW IT IS MENTIONED. HEY IF THAT TRIBES GET NO HAS A GRANT APPLICATION AND THEY'RE NOT GETTING THE FUNDS YOU KNOW BECAUSE JUST IF THEY WERE TO SIT ON THAT THAT THAT PANEL. SOLELY WITHIN THEIR THERE'S THERE'S THERE'S. THERE'S KIND OF. NO ANIMOSITY THERE'S THIS ISSUE THE OTHER TRIBES RELATE TO NEIGHBOR NEIGHBORING TRIBES THAT THAT THEY HAVE THEIR AND SO IF THERE WAS THAT PANELS TO BE DEVELOPED. THEN. NOTE THAT TRIBE MAY NOT IF DEPEND ON WHO'S ON THE PANEL WOULD BE ABLE TO BEGIN A TO GIVE FUNDS. THE INEQUITY THAT WE TALK ABOUT AS FAR THE DISTRIBUTION. WHERE I THINK IT WAS MENTIONED EARLIER ABOUT THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS IS IS PROJECTED TO COME INTO NEXT YEAR? AND IN THOSE BECAUSE STATIONS THEY SAID WELL MAYBE WOULD DO LIKE A TWENTY MILLION DOLLAR PROJECT HERE. LEFT IN TWO FIVE MILLION DOLLAR PROJECTS THIS YOU KNOW IN A GIVEN YEAR OVER HERE. THE OTHER SEVENTY TWO TRIBES THAT ARE ELIGIBLE FOR THIS YOU KNOW THAT LAST TRIBE THAT'S GONNA GET FUNDS TWENTY SOME YEARS LATER YOU KNOW. DURING THIS WHOLE TIME IF IT WAS FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS. THEY CAN GO GET USE THOSE FUNDS. AND ACQUIRE SHOULD BE LANDING YOU KNOW OVER THOSE OVER THOSE YEARS AT TWENTY SEVEN YEARS BY TIME THEY GOT RECEIVE FUNDS AND HAD THAT INDEX. THAT'S ALWAYS SAID IT'S DISTRIBUTE AN EQUAL BASIS. GIVE THOSE TRIBES. AN OPPORTUNITY IN THE VERY FIRST YEAR IF IT WAS TO BE PASSED ALL SEVENTY TWO TRIBES TO GO OUT AND SEEK TRADITIONAL LENDING AND ALL TRIGGER TRIES BE EQUALLY AFFECTED. AND USE THOSE FUNDS HOW THEY FEEL. BESS DRESSES THEIR KNEES ON THE RESERVATION BECAUSE WHETHER IT'S ROADS TO GYMNASIUM. WATER SYSTEMS THEY CAN GO AND LEVERAGE THOSE FUNDS IN THAT FIRST YEAR. ALL SEVENTY TWO TRIES BUT IF YOU HAVE TO WAIT TO TWENTY YEARS LATER DOWN THE ROAD WHEN WHEN YOU GET YOUR GRANT YOU KNOW FINALLY. AND AND THEN LIKE CHAIRMAN HUNTER SAID. YOU KNOW THERE'S THERE'S THERE'S ADMINISTRATION IS OUT THERE THAT HAVE VERY VERY LIMITED STAFF OR NONE AT ALL. WE TALK ABOUT A COMPETITIVE GRANT PROCESS WE SEE THAT IN THE FEDERAL. PROCESS RIGHT NOW WHERE GRANT OF VERY COMPETITIVE YOU KNOW AND EIGHT TRIBES HAVE TO DEMONSTRATE THAT THE THE FUNDS ARE GOING TO BE A GOOD PURPOSE AND THEY'RE GOING TO USE IT FOR SUCCESSFUL. APPLICATION. KNOW HOW THE TRIBES GOING HELD ONE TRIBE THAT HAS NO NO MINISTRY OF STAFF GOING TO. EUROPE AGAINST ANOTHER TRIBE HAS A DECENT NO MINISTRY OF STAFF THAT CAN DEMONSTRATE THAT THAT'S GOING TO BE A SUCCESSFUL PROGRAMS GOING CONTINUE TO OPERATE. THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE THE NOT GOING TO BE EQUAL IN THERE FOR THIS ONE PROBABLY WILL BE ON PAPER A BETTER YOU KNOW AND THIS ONE'S GOING TO BE RISKS YOU KNOW A HIGHER RISK AND AND IT'S NOT GOING TO WORK OUT FOR THEM THEY'RE NOT GONNA GET. AWARDED FUNDS. AND SO THAT'S WHAT WE'VE WE SEE. THIS WHOLE PROCESS OF CREATING ANOTHER AMINI B. I A IN CALIFORNIA IS IT'S IT'S NOT SOME THAT CALIFORNIA SHOULD WANT TO DO YOU KNOW AND AND AND. THE FUNDS THAT ARE BEING CREATED IN THE AND AND THE TRIBES THERE. ARE CONTRIBUTING TO IT THEY DON'T WANT TO SEE ANOTHER PATERNALISTIC YOU KNOW OR. BE AYE A KINDA RULE FROM CALIFORNIA THAT YOU WANTED TO HELP THOSE ELIGIBLE TRIBES TO GET MORE FOR MORE REFUNDS. RATHER THAN OURS DO YOU HAVE AND AND SO THAT'S WHY WE WERE PROPOSING SOME THAT'S EQUAL BECOME A DISTRIBUTED EQUALLY TO ALL THOSE TRIBES IN IN IN THE FIRST YEAR. ALL SEVENTY TRIBES TUNISIAN CHARGE CAN BE COOLEY BENEFIT FROM IT. IT DOES STRIKE ME I'M. SO I THINK THERE'S COMPELLING ARGUMENT ON BOTH SIDES AS I LISTEN TO THAT DISCUSSION AND IT STRIKES ME THAT COMBINATION OF THE HONESTY OF. AND THE TNG HALF. ABOUT CREATE A KIND OF A. DUAL TRACK SYSTEM WHERE YOU DO HAVE A BASELINE FOR EVERY TRIBE AND YOU ALSO HAVE A SEPARATE FUND THAT COULD BE AWARDED IN PERHAPS A LARGER CHUNKS. FORCED THE FOR THE SPECIFIC. TYPES PROJECTS IT CHAIRMAN HUNTER RAISED. IT DOES SEEM THAT THERE COULD BE SOME BENEFIT THERE BUT IT IT IT IT RAISES ANOTHER QUESTION IN MY MIND THAT PREDATES MY SERVICE. IN THE LEGISLATURE IN SOME RESPECTS WITCHES. BOTH OF THESE FUNDS WERE NEGOTIATED COMPACTS. RIGHT. SO WHAT'S YOUR PERSPECTIVE ON WHY WE DIDN'T DEAL. WITH. HOW WE'RE GOING TO SPEND THE MONEY AT THE TIME THAT WE NEGOTIATED TO FIND IN THE COMPACT BETWEEN THE STATE AND THE TRIBE? I MEAN OBVIOUSLY EACH TRIBE HAVE TO SPEAK FOR ITSELF NAPA JUST YOUR PERSPECTIVE AND. CERTAINLY YOUR EXPERIENCES. IN THOSE PROCESS IN THAT PROCESS. I AGREE I WOULD OBJECT THAT TO ANY ANY OF THE CHAIRMAN WHO WOULD LIKE TO RESPOND WE HEARD AT AT ONE OF THE MEETINGS A SEA KNIGHT WHO WAS. THIS. WAS FORCED UPON THOSE. TRIBES THAT HAD TO OF NEVER COMING UP FOR COMBAT NEGOTIATIONS IS SOMETHING THAT THE STATE WANTED AND THEREFORE HE WANTED THE COMPACT DISC WAS SOME THAT WAS FORCED TO HAD TO BE IN A COMPACT IF THEY WANT A NEW COMPACT. AND SO. THEY HAD TO BASICALLY TAKE IT YOU KNOW AND IF THEY WANTED A COMPACT TO GET THROUGH LEGISLATORS AND THAT'S THAT'S BASICALLY WHAT WE HEARD. CHRISTOPHER CROSSES. THE FLIP SIDE OF THAT ARGUMENT WOULD BE THAT'S A NEGOTIATION. GRAVERT EVEN TAKE WHERE. DUCK TO PARTIES. DON'T END UP WITH EVERYTHING THEY WANT IN THE IN THE COMPAQ BUT IT'S JUST INTERESTING AYE AYE THAT WE DIDN'T IDENTIFY THAT. AND PERHAPS IT WASN'T FORESEEN TO BUY SOME OF THE TRACKS. MORE I'D I'D LIKE TO RESPOND AS WELL CAUSE I WAS THERE IN THE BEGINNING WHEN WE START THE NIGHT I'M COMPACTS. AND WE DID HAVE A PROCESS IS CALLED OUR STF. AND AS EXACTLY WHAT WE MANAGED TO DO IS GIVE THEM ONTO THE TRIBES. THAT HAD LESS AGREE ON FIFTY MACHINES NOW WE PAY INTO THAT WE DON'T RECEIVE ANY MONEY FROM. BUT IS NOT OUR PLACE TO TELL THEM WHAT TO DO WITH IT AND NEVER DISRESPECTED A CHAIRMAN HUNDRED THAT THE SOUNDS LIKE HE'S DOING QUITE WELL. WITHOUT THAT THE NEW TNG ACROSS HAS BEEN INEFFECTIVE HE'S ONE AFTER GRASSO AND I COMMEND HIM FOR THAT. HE IS DOING A REALLY GOOD JOB THERE'S SOME TRIBES ARE JUST THAT MAY NOT BE POSSIBLE. BUT. ON THE OTHER HAND THEY MAY BE ABLE TO LOOK TO THEM AS WELL AND SO WILL LOOK THIS IS WHAT THEY DID AND WE COULD DO THE SAME THING. SO. IT IT IN AN ECONOMY. IF MEMORY SERVES ME THE THE. KID JEFF OBVIOUSLY WAS ESTABLISHED. LATER THAN THEY ARE CITY FM FOR FOR THOSE ACCESS FUNDS AND MAYBE MY QUESTIONS MORE PER THAT. UPON THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THAT FUND. WHY THE VARIOUS PARTIES INCLUDING ADMINISTRATION AND THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE DIDN'T NEGOTIATE? WELL THIS IS HOW WE'RE GOING TO. ALLOCATE OR SPEND THESE FUNDS WELL I GUESS I I DO. RIGHT THERE WITH VIA. DIDN'T ASK US EITHER SO. OKAY PUBLIC. IT'S KINDA GOES BACK TO THE FACT WHICH PUBLIC HEARD FOR IN THE CONSULTATIONS AS JOE DOING AND MENTION. IS TO DIVERSE. THE DUBBED THE PERSPECTIVES OF THE TRIBES YOU KNOW SOME WANTED SOMEONE IT THIS WAY OTHERS ARE OPPOSED TO IT. WEARS A BECAUSE OF THE BUREAUCRACY TO THE PROCESS THAT'S GOING TO BE CREATED INTO IT YOU KNOW THAT THE COMPETITIVE PROCESS YOU KNOW AND THEN HAVING A PANEL WHILE AND HAVE TO REVIEW IN. AND SAY HEY YOU KNOW WHAT TRIBE YOUR TRIED NEEDS ARE GREATER THAN THIS TRIBES NEEDS NO PUT EVERY TRIBE AS A SELF GOVERNMENT HAS THE RIGHT TO DETERMINE WHAT'S PRIORITIES OR ITS OWN. AND IT SHOULD BE LEFT UP TO A PANEL OR SOMEBODY ELSE ANOTHER TRIBE. TO TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT THEY CAN HAVE THAT BECAUSE AND SO THAT'S PROBABLY MOST LIKELY THE REASON WHY A A FRAMEWORK HASN'T BEEN. DRAFTED IN PUTTING ANY COMPACT AND STILL THE FRAMEWORK STILL NOT EVEN IN AB EIGHTY AS IT IS CURRENTLY WRITTEN. RICHEST TRIBESMAN AGAIN THE SYSTEM FOR PURPOSES OF DISCUSSION HERE. TODAY THAT IT COULD HAVE BEEN A FRAMER COULD HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED PRIOR TO ADOPTING. A DOES COMPACTS THAT THE THAT THE TNG AFTER DESERT AND BOTH PARTIES WHO NEGOTIATED THE COMPACT ON BOTH SIDES COULD HAVE. I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO ESTABLISH THAT FRAMEWORK AND HERE WE ARE DEALING WITH THE LEGISLATIVE PROPOSAL TRIES DAMAGE THAT FRAMEWORK THAT WASN'T. OBVIOUSLY ESTABLISH SO IT'S JUST AN INTERESTING A DISCUSSION I'LL GO AHEAD AND BRING IT BACK TO THE REST THE COMMITTEE IF THERE'S. SOME ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR. COMMENTS AT THIS TIME. SEEING THE OTHER LIKE TO THANK ALL OF CHAIRMAN FOR YOUR TIME AND. AND YOUR TESTIMONY HERE TODAY AND I APPRECIATE THE DIALOGUE ON THIS IMPORTANT TOPIC. OKAY MEMBERS AT THIS TIME WE'RE GOING TO MOVE TO THE LAST PANEL. AND ASK. STACEY UNA BAXTER WELL AS STEPHANIE. ALICIA MATZAH TO APPROACH. THIS. BAXTER IS WITH THE CALIFORNIA GIMLI CONTROL COMMISSION. I WISH NOT TO. WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE BUREAU OF GAMBLING CONTROL IF YOU GO AHEAD AND. APPROACH AND PRESENT. YOUR TESTIMONY THANK YOU. CORRECTION OUR MISS BAXTER'S NOT ATTENDANCE AND WE HAVE A PINCH HITTER SO GO AHEAD AND INTRODUCE YOURSELF. GOOD MORNING SERMON GRAY INSTRUMENTS AUDIT MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. AND A CARD DEPUTY DIRECTOR LEGISLATION REGULATORY AFFAIRS WITH THE CALIFORNIA GET WHAT CONTROL COMMISSION. I'M HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF STACEY LYNN BAXTER AND WITH ME TODAY IS RICHELLE RYAN. THE COMMISSION'S TRIBAL FUNDS ADMINISTRATOR. UNDER AB EIGHT EIGHTY THE COMMISSION'S ROLE AS THE ADMINISTRATOR OF THE FUND WOULD BE SIMILAR TO THE COMMISSION'S ROLE AS THE ADMINISTRATOR. OF THE REVENUE SHARING TRUST FUND FOR THE PAST EIGHTEEN YEARS. IN ADDITION THE COMMISSION WILL PROVIDE ADMINISTRATIVE SUPPORT SERVICES FOR THE NEW GRANT PROGRAM. BASED ON THE DIRECTION OF THE TRIBAL ADVISER IN THE PANEL AND IN CONSULTATION WITH FEDERALLY RECOGNIZED TRIBES. THESE RESPONSIBILITIES WOULD GENERALLY INCLUDE PROCESSING THE GRANT APPLICATIONS PROVIDING ASSISTANCE DISBURSING THE GRANTS. PROVIDING AN APPLICATION FORM APPROVED BY THE PANEL AND ASSISTING IN DEVELOPING THE VARIOUS PROCESSES AND PROCEDURES TO IMPLEMENT THE PROGRAM. THE COMMISSION WILL ALSO PROVIDE APPLICATION FORMS TO ELIGIBLE TRIBES AND PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO APPLICANTS ON THE GRANT APPLICATION PROCESS. IN ADDITION THE COMMISSION WILL PREPARE AN ANNUAL REPORT ON THE STATUS OF THE GRANTS. IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT UNDER EIGHTY EIGHT EIGHTY THE COMMISSION WOULD NOT BE PERMITTED TO COMPLETE A GRANT APPLICATION ON BEHALF OF THE TRIBE. DEVELOP THE CRITERIA FOR THE GRANTS OR EXERCISE IN THE CONTROLLER DISCRETION. OVER THE APPROVAL OR DISAPPROVAL OF THE GRANT APPLICATIONS. THE BILL IS CONSISTENT WITH THE RECENT COMPACTS THAT STATE OF THE DIS THE COMMISSION SHALL NOT EXERCISE CONTROL. OR DISCRETION OVER THE USER DISBURSEMENT OF TRIBAL NATION GRANDSON BUNNIES. OVERALL THE COMMISSION'S RESPONSIBILITIES RELATED TO THE NEW TRIBAL NATION CRAP FUND PROGRAMS WOULD INVOLVE ADMINISTERING THE FUND. AND PROVIDED ADMINISTRATIVE SUPPORT SERVICES TO HELP ESTABLISH AND IMPLEMENT. THIS NEW PROGRAM. WE LOOK FORWARD TO ASSISTING WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROGRAM AND WE ARE HAPPY TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE ANY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. NECESSARY. AND WERE AVAILABLE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH MAX. THE MORNING CHAIRMAN DODD MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS DEFINITION MAZU. AND I AM THE DIRECTOR OF THE BUREAU OF GALA CONTROL WITHIN THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. AND ON BEHALF OF ATTORNEY GENERAL HONEY SARAH THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY DISCUSS THE BUREAU'S ROLE IN THE TRAVEL NATION BRENNAN PROGRAM. AS PROPOSED BY ASSEMBLY BILL EIGHT EIGHTY. SO WITH A LITTLE BIT OF BACKGROUND THE BUREAU CURRENTLY HAS FORTY ONE POSITIONS IN ITS BODY AND COME COMPAQ COMPLIANCE. SECTION THE MAJORITY OF WHOM ARE AUDITOR'S TO CONDUCT COMPLAINTS REVIEWS PURSUANT TO TROUBLE STATE GAMING COMPACTS. AS WELL AS STATUTES AND REGULATIONS PERTAINING TO GAMBLING ESTABLISHMENTS OR CARD ROOMS IN THE STATE. FOR TRIBAL GAMING OUR STAFF CONDUCTS AUDITS OF PAYMENTS TO THE SPECIAL DISTRIBUTION FUND. THE REVENUE SHARING TRUST FUND AND OTHER REVENUE CONTRIBUTIONS PROVIDE FOR THE COMPLEX. I WHICH WILL ALSO INCLUDE TRAVEL NATION RENDON. THESE ARTISTS ARE CONDUCTED AT LEAST EVERY TWO YEARS. PERO STAFF ALSO CONDUCTS ANNUAL REVIEWS TO ENSURE THE NON GAMING AND THE MANY GAMING TRIBES ARE ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE THEIR DISTRIBUTIONS FROM THE REVENUE SHARING TRUST FUND. AND REVIEWS MINIMUM TROUBLE MIDDLEMAN TRAIL CONTROL STANDARDS FOR CLASS THREE GAMING AT LEAST EVERY TWO YEARS. WE ALSO CONDUCT INSPECTIONS ARE DESK REVIEWS FOR ELECTRONIC GAMING DEVICES. ABOUT FOUR TIMES A YEAR TO COME FROM COMPLIANCE WITH MANUFACTURER STANDARDS AND THE TROUBLE. GAME AGENCIES REGULATIONS. ADDITIONALLY BUREAU STAFF AT OUR TRIBAL LICENSING SECTION ROUTINELY WORK TRAVEL GAME AGENCIES. ON LICENSING TYPE MATTERS FOR TRIBAL KEY EMPLOYEES AND VENDORS. AND STAFF ARE COMPLIANCE AND ENFORCEMENT SECTION CONDUCTS ANNUAL COMPLIANCE COMPAQ COMPLIANCE INSPECTIONS AND WORKS WITH TROUBLED GAME AGENCIES ON CRIMINAL MATTERS. SO SINCE IT CALIFORNIA HAS APPROVED TRIBAL GAMING WE HAVE WORK TOWARD DEVELOPING POSITIVE WORKING RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE TRIBAL GAMING AGENCIES ARE ALSO VERY FAMILIAR WITH THE PROVISIONS OF THE TRIBAL STATE COMPACTS. ASSEMBLY BILL EIGHT EIGHTY AS CURRENTLY DRAFTED REQUIRES THINK BUREAU TO CONDUCT AUDITS OF THE USE OF THE GRANT FUNDS. I FROM THE NET TREPIDATION GRANT FUNDS. THE PROCESS BROUGHT IN THE USE OF THE GRANTS WILL BE DEVELOPED BY THE TRAVEL ADVISOR AND THE TREPIDATION GRANT PANEL. IN CONSULTATION WITH FEDERALLY RECOGNIZED TRIBES IN CALIFORNIA. SO GIVEN THE BUREAU'S CURRENT ROLE IN EXPERIENCE WORKING WITH TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS IN TROUBLE GAME AGENCIES WE BELIEVE. OUR ROLE IN THE USE OF THE GRANT FUND PROGRAM IS APPROPRIATE. ONCE THE PANEL SELECTED THE GRANT PROCESS ESTABLISHED IN THE PROCESS FOR AIDID PIECE OF THE GRANTS IS DEVELOPED BY THE PANEL. THE ROCHA BILL DETERMINE WHAT TYPE OF ADDITIONAL RESOURCES WILL NEED TO CARRY OUT OUR RESPONSIBILITIES. SO THANK YOU AND I AM OPEN TO ANY QUESTIONS GREAT THANK YOU. I HAVE A COUPLE OF FOR THE THAT CAN WE KEEP TROLL COMMISSION UNDER THE PROPOSED LANGUAGE THE. CALIFORNIA GAMBLING CONTROL COMMISSION WILL PROVIDE ADMINISTRATIVE. A SUPPORT. I WOULD THE COMMISSION NEED AT STAFF TO HEAR IT TO ADHERE TO THIS MANDATE. SO MADE THAT WE WOULD NEED ONE POSITION AND FUNDING FOR THE PROGRAM ART AT THIS POINT OUR ESTIMATES. IS THAT COSTS WOULD LIKELY BE UNDER TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS PER YEAR SO WE WOULD NEED TO SUBMIT THE BCP. FOR THOSE OF RESOURCES. K.. AND THEN. FOR THE GAMBLING CONTROL UNDER THE PROPOSED LANGUAGE THAT BUREAU OF GAMBLING CONTROL WILL CONDUCT AUDITS. I TO ENSURE THE FUNDS ARE USED IN A CONSISTENT MANNER WITH THE APPLICATION OF THE AWARD. HOUSES CONSISTENT WITH THE CURRENT AUDITING REQUIREMENTS THE BUREAU MAINTAINS. A RELATING TO TRIBAL GAMING IS VERY CONSISTENT THE BUREAU DOES ALL OF THE KIND OF AUDITING AND REVIEWS UNDER THE TROUBLE STATE GAMING COMPACTS SO AGAIN SINCE WE'D.

NO I I'M NOT DONE YET. OKAY. WE A PUBLIC COMMENT. PERIOD NOW ANYBODY FROM THE PUBLIC WHICH SHE TO. ADDRESS THE. JOINT COMMITTEE. IT'S OUR IT'S OKAY. GOOD MORNING ATANY CAMERA TRIBAL ATTORNEY FOR THE. TOLERATING THE NATION WHICH IS A LIMITED GAMING TRIBE. APPROXIMATELY EIGHT MILES SOUTH OF THE OREGON BORDER THEIR OF AN ARTIST TF BENEFICIARY IN WOULD BE THE BENEFICIARY OF THE TNG OFF. WE SUPPORT. THE EFFORTS OF THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND THE TRIBES WHO HAVE STEPPED UP AND ARE WILLING TO FUND THE TNG OFF. AND BELIEVE THAT. WE ARE RELATIVELY CLOSE TO HAVING AS CLOSE TO THE CONSENSUS IS POSSIBLE MOVING FORWARD WITH RESPECT TO WHAT AB EIGHT EIGHTY LOOKS LIKE AND DUMP WE SUPPORT THE EFFORTS. UP I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO SEPARATE. THE NEGOTIATION OF THE COMPACT FROM THE IMPLEMENTATION. OF THE COMPACTS OF THOSE TRIBES WHO'VE AGREED TO PAY INTO THE END TNG UP SELF THANK YOU FOR YOUR EFFORTS. GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN DODD AYE CHAIRMAN RAYMOND CHUCKIE HITCHCOCK I'M. CHAIRMAN WHAT RANCHERIA HERE IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY. I I'M IN SUPPORT OF AB EIGHT EIGHTY. I KNOW THERE'S SOME LANGUAGE THAT NEEDS TO BE WORKED OUT. BUT WE ARE REVENUE SHARING TRUST FUND TRIBE HERE WE HAVE ALMOST EIGHT HUNDRED MEMBERS AND WHERE ARE FORTUNATE TO GET THE ONE POINT ONE MILLION. I AS JUST RECENTLY LAST YEAR WE. ENTERED INTO A COMPACT THAT HAS A TRIBAL NATIONS GRANT FUND AND WE WERE GIVEN MEANINGFUL CONCESSIONS IS PART OF THE NEGOTIATIONS WHICH WE. ARE WE REFER RESPECTFULLY. AGREED TO. I THE TRIBAL NATIONS GRANT FUND WITH THE EXCESS MONEY WOULD GIVE TRIBES AN OPPORTUNITY TO TAP INTO OTHER RESOURCES IN GRANTS TO HELP THEIR MEMBERS IN THEIR TRIBES. I SEE THAT THE LANGUAGE HAS. COMPETITIVE GRANTS IN IT AND THAT'S KIND OF THE CONTENTION. YEAH A HUNDRED NINE TRIBES IN CALIFORNIA SO YOU GET A HUNDRED NINE DIFFERENT VIEWS ON THIS BUT I THINK THERE'S A BALANCE THAT CAN BE STRUCK BETWEEN THIS OF. POTENTIAL COMPETITIVE GRANTS THAT IF THERE'S THIRTY MILLION IN A POT FIFTEEN MILLION OF ITS FOR COMPETITIVE GRANTS IN THE OTHER FIFTEEN COULD BE. SPLIT EQUALLY AMONG TRIBES THAT ARE ARE STF. AND THOSE EQUALLY AMOUNTS COULD BE BASED OFF OF HOW MANY MEMBERS. BECAUSE OUR TRIBE HAS EIGHT HUNDRED MEMBERS CLOSELY AND WE A ONE POINT ONE MILLION AND HAVE ANOTHER TRY THAT MAY ONLY HAVE THIRTY MEMBERS AND THEY GET ONE POINT ONE MILLION. SO THERE'S LITTLE DIVERSITY THERE WHAT YOU CAN DO WITH EIGHT HUNDRED MEMBERS AND ONE POINT ONE MILLION AND TWENTY MEMBERS. TO PROVIDE SERVICES WE CURRENTLY USE OUR TF FUNDS TO HELP ELDER SERVICES AYE WE GIVE SCHOLARSHIPS TO OUR OUR STUDENTS TO GO TO COLLEGE AND THINGS THAT NATURE. I JUST THINK THERE'S LANGUAGE THAT CAN BE WORKED AS LONG AS IT'S. AGREE WITH THE TRIBE THE TRIBAL ADVISER POSITION IS SOMETHING THAT'S IMPORTANT AS A PERMANENT POSITION WITH THE GOVERNOR. SOMEBODY THAT'S FROM A FEDERALLY RECOGNIZED TRIBE TO BE THAT LIAISON BETWEEN THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND THE TRIBES HERE IN CALIFORNIA. TRIBAL SOVEREIGNTY IS ALREADY SEE SOMETHING THAT ALL TRIBES ARE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT I THINK AT THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE IN MISTER JONAS. I WORK TO TRY TO YOU KNOW LEVY EIGHT SOME OF THAT LANGUAGE AS WELL. I I I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY HERE WITH THE GOVERNOR LEAVING THIS YEAR SEEKING OUT TO FIND FIND THE STRIKE THE BALANCE. AND MAKE THIS HAPPEN THIS YEAR DOING THIS LEGISLATIVE SESSION AND DON'T LET THIS SLIP AWAY BECAUSE THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL TRIBES TO BE ABLE TO. I REAP THE BENEFITS OF THIS IT'S JUST. FINDING THAT BALANCE THAT EVERYBODY CAN AGREE ON THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN. SUSAN JOHNSON EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA NATION'S INDIAN GAMING ASSOCIATION WE REPRESENT THIRTY FIVE TRIBES FROM THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND FROM TRIBES OF BOTH PAY INTO THE TNG F.. AND THOSE. THAT WILL BE RECIPIENTS OF THE T. NGF AND AS YOU'VE SEEN TODAY. THERE'S DISAGREEMENT AMONG HOW THAT'S DONE THEIR SUPPORT FOR THE T. NGF THERE'S OPPOSITION MOST OF THE OPPOSITION COMES FROM THE COMPACT IN PROCESS SO TRYING TO TAKE THE CONTRACTING PROCESS OUT. BUT THAT BE BETWEEN THE TRIBE IN THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE LOOKING AT EIGHT EIGHTY WE AGREE THAT THIS MONEY SHOULD I BE DISTRIBUTED HOW THAT MONEY IS GOING TO BE DISTRIBUTED. IS THE LOOK BUT IS THE RUB AND SO WE'RE WORKING WITH OUR MEMBERS WE APPRECIATE THIS HEARING I THINK THIS. BEGINS THAT DISCUSSION MORE WITH YOU DIRECTLY WITH THE TRIBES. AND WE'RE GONNA DO OUR BEST TO. HELP MOVE THIS FORWARD IN SOME WAY THAT WORKS FOR AND ALL OF THE TRIBES BUT WE WANT TO. SAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR HAVING THIS HEARING AND A STARTING THAT DISCUSSION.
