HOW DO WE ASSIST CALIFORNIANS

00:57:18.535 --> 00:57:20.236
WITH THE ECONOMIC RECOVERY OVER

00:57:20.303 --> 00:57:22.839
THE NEXT FEW YEARS. HOW DO WE

00:57:22.906 --> 00:57:24.174
BALANCE OUR STATE'S LONG TERM

00:57:24.240 --> 00:57:26.743
FISCAL HEALTH AGAINST CUTS IN

00:57:26.810 --> 00:57:28.478
GOVERNMENT SERVICES WHICH WILL

00:57:28.545 --> 00:57:31.247
EXACERBATE THE ECONOMIC PAIN

00:57:31.314 --> 00:57:33.016
FAMILIES ARE NOW FEELING. HOW

00:57:33.082 --> 00:57:34.951
MUCH ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL RISK

00:57:35.018 --> 00:57:36.719
SHOULD OUR STATE TAKE LONG TO

00:57:36.786 --> 00:57:38.454
AID THOSE FAMILIES. WHO HAVE NO

00:57:38.521 --> 00:57:40.557
SAVINGS AND NO RESOURCES TO

00:57:40.623 --> 00:57:43.359
BORROW FROM. IF WE MUST MANAGE

00:57:43.426 --> 00:57:45.528
THIS DISEASE FOR MANY YEARS TO

00:57:45.595 --> 00:57:47.597
COME AS SCIENTISTS PREDICT. HOW

00:57:47.664 --> 00:57:48.531
DO WE ALLOW FOR QUICK AND

00:57:48.598 --> 00:57:50.300
DECISIVE ACTIONS NEEDED IN

00:57:50.366 --> 00:57:52.435
TIMES OF CRISIS. WITHOUT

00:57:52.502 --> 00:57:54.571
SACRIFICING A DELIBERATIVE IN

00:57:54.637 --> 00:57:55.972
TRANSPARENT DEMOCRATIC

00:57:56.039 --> 00:57:58.141
GOVERNMENT. HOW DO WE ENSURE

00:57:58.208 --> 00:57:59.742
PUBLIC PARTICIPATION AT A TIME

00:57:59.809 --> 00:58:01.144

RISE TO THIS CHALLENGE AND FIND

00:58:08.051 --> 00:58:08.551

LEGISLATURE AS- WE GATHER. TO

00:58:43.820 --> 00:58:45.455
TRY AND CRAFT A BUDGET THAT

00:58:45.521 --> 00:58:46.823
WILL ACCOMPLISH ONE PURPOSE AND

00:58:46.890 --> 00:58:48.625
ONE PURPOSE ALONE. WHICH IS TO

00:58:48.691 --> 00:58:50.326
SET CALIFORNIA ON THE ROAD TO

00:58:50.393 --> 00:58:51.861
RECOVERY FROM THIS

00:58:51.928 --> 00:58:56.032
UNPRECEDENTED THAT. TO THAT END.

00:58:56.099 --> 00:58:57.667
ALL OF THE QUESTIONS THAT I'M

00:58:57.734 --> 00:58:59.168
GOING TO BE DIRECTED TO THE LA

00:58:59.235 --> 00:59:00.336
ONLY DO YOU HAVE TODAY WE'RE

00:59:00.403 --> 00:59:01.971
GOING TO ASK JUST ONE QUESTION

00:59:02.038 --> 00:59:03.473
DOES THE MAY REVISION THAT THE

00:59:03.539 --> 00:59:05.241
GOVERNOR HAS PRESENTED SET US

00:59:05.308 --> 00:59:07.110
ON THAT PATH IN MANY WAYS I

00:59:07.176 --> 00:59:08.478
THINK IT DOES BUT I HAVE SOME

00:59:08.544 --> 00:59:10.647
SERIOUS CONCERNS THE FIRST OF

00:59:10.713 --> 00:59:13.116
MY CONCERNS. IS WHETHER OR NOT

00:59:13.182 --> 00:59:15.218
THIS BUDGET SETS ON APPROPRIATE

00:59:15.285 --> 00:59:16.486
DIVISION BETWEEN EXECUTIVE

00:59:16.552 --> 00:59:18.421
AUTHORITY ON ONE HAND AND TO

00:59:18.488 --> 00:59:20.757
THE OVERSIGHT AUTHORITY OF THE

00:59:20.823 --> 00:59:22.859
LEGISLATURE ON THE OTHER. WHEN

00:59:22.926 --> 00:59:24.661
WE LEFT SEVERAL MONTHS AGO WE

00:59:24.727 --> 00:59:26.162
GAVE THE GOVERNOR OF BILLION

00:59:26.229 --> 00:59:27.430
DOLLARS IN APPROPRIATIONS

00:59:27.497 --> 00:59:28.665
AUTHORITY TO STOP THE SPREAD OF

00:59:28.731 --> 00:59:29.832
CORONAVIRUS AND I THINK THAT

00:59:29.899 --> 00:59:31.534
WAS A VERY APPROPRIATE ACTION.

00:59:31.601 --> 00:59:32.735
FOR US TO TAKE HOWEVER THE

00:59:32.802 --> 00:59:34.837
GOVERNOR'S ASKING US TODAY TO

00:59:34.904 --> 00:59:37.206
GIVE HIM. AN ADDITIONAL THREE

00:59:37.273 --> 00:59:37.774
BILLION DOLLARS OF SPENDING

00:59:37.840 --> 00:59:40.143
AUTHORITY. AND IN ADDITION TO

00:59:40.209 --> 00:59:41.878
THAT TO GIVEN AUTHORITY. TO

00:59:41.945 --> 00:59:43.813
SPEND THE TEN MILLION DAHLE TEN

00:59:43.880 --> 00:59:44.981
BILLION DOLLARS OF FEDERAL

00:59:45.048 --> 00:59:45.982
REIMBURSEMENT FUNDS TO COME

00:59:46.049 --> 00:59:46.683
BACK FROM THE FEDERAL

00:59:46.749 --> 00:59:48.718
GOVERNMENT. IN WAYS THAT HE

00:59:48.785 --> 00:59:51.587
SEES VINCE. AND I HAVE CONCERNS

00:59:51.654 --> 00:59:52.055
THAT THAT MIGHT NOT BE

00:59:52.121 --> 00:59:53.556
APPROPRIATE ACTION TO TAKE. WE

00:59:53.623 --> 00:59:54.891
HAVE A CONSTITUTIONAL DUTY TO

00:59:54.958 --> 00:59:56.592
OVERSEE THE SPENDING OF THOSE

00:59:56.659 --> 00:59:58.561
TAXPAYER DOLLARS. WE CAN EASILY

00:59:58.628 --> 01:00:00.430
RECONVENE EVEN IF WE'RE NOT IN

01:00:00.496 --> 01:00:02.365
SESSION THIS FALL. TO EXERCISE

01:00:02.432 --> 01:00:04.033
THAT AUTHORITY AND I'D LIKE TO

01:00:04.100 --> 01:00:06.803
BE A PARTNER TO THE GOVERNOR IN

01:00:06.869 --> 01:00:07.437
THE ADMINISTRATION AND SPENDING

01:00:07.503 --> 01:00:09.405
THAT MONEY. THE SECOND CONCERN

01:00:09.472 --> 01:00:10.673
I HAVE IS THAT WE ALL OF

01:00:10.740 --> 01:00:12.008
KNOWLEDGE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE

01:00:12.075 --> 01:00:13.943
TO MAKE LARGE CUTS. TO BALANCE

01:00:14.010 --> 01:00:15.878
OUR BUDGET THIS YEAR. AND I

01:00:15.945 --> 01:00:17.213
THINK I SPEAK FOR EVERYONE IN

01:00:17.280 --> 01:00:18.948
THIS CHAMBER WHEN I SAY. WE

01:00:19.015 --> 01:00:20.249
NEED TO ENSURE THAT WERE STILL

01:00:20.316 --> 01:00:21.884
PROTECTING THE MOST VULNERABLE

01:00:21.951 --> 01:00:24.087
SEGMENTS OF OUR SOCIETY. AND WE

01:00:24.153 --> 01:00:25.755
DIDN'T NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:00:25.822 --> 01:00:27.790
THE CUTS WERE MAKING. OUR

01:00:27.857 --> 01:00:29.559
INCONGRUENCE WITH OUR VALUES AS

01:00:29.625 --> 01:00:31.861
CALIFORNIANS. NOW THE GOVERNOR

01:00:31.928 --> 01:00:33.830
HAS PROPOSED A SORT OF CUTS IN

01:00:33.896 --> 01:00:35.298
THE BUDGET AND IT'S SOMETHING

01:00:35.365 --> 01:00:36.499
THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE REFINING

01:00:36.566 --> 01:00:37.967
OVER THE NEXT COUPLE WEEKS I

01:00:38.034 --> 01:00:38.768
THINK SOME OF THOSE CUTS ARE

01:00:38.835 --> 01:00:40.036
APPROPRIATE SOME OF THEM I

01:00:40.103 --> 01:00:41.270
THINK WE ARE GOING TO AGREE OR

01:00:41.337 --> 01:00:42.438
NOT AND I'LL GIVE YOU ONE

01:00:42.505 --> 01:00:44.107
EXAMPLE FROM MY OWN DISTRICT

01:00:44.173 --> 01:00:44.907
THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED TO

01:00:44.974 --> 01:00:46.709
CLOSE THE BARSTOW VETERANS

01:00:46.776 --> 01:00:49.078
HOME. IN BARSTOW CALIFORNIA I

01:00:49.145 --> 01:00:50.313
WAS IN BARSTOW YESTERDAY THERE

01:00:50.380 --> 01:00:51.481
WAS A RALLY TO SAVE THE

01:00:51.547 --> 01:00:53.016
VETERANS HOME ALTHOUGH WAS OVER

01:00:53.082 --> 01:00:54.484
A HUNDRED DEGREES IN BARSTOW WE

01:00:54.550 --> 01:00:55.985
HAD OVER FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE

01:00:56.052 --> 01:00:57.954
BY MY COUNT YET THAT REALLY

01:00:58.021 --> 01:01:01.257
EXPRESSING OUTRAGE. THAT WE AS

01:01:01.324 --> 01:01:04.394
A LEGISLATURE. WHAT CONSIDER.

01:01:04.460 --> 01:01:06.496
THROWING NEARLY TWO HUNDRED

01:01:06.562 --> 01:01:07.397
ELDERLY VETERANS OUT OF THEIR

01:01:07.463 --> 01:01:08.998
HOME AND I HOPE THAT EVERYONE

01:01:09.065 --> 01:01:09.665
WOULD AGREE THAT'S NOT

01:01:09.732 --> 01:01:12.001
SOMETHING. THAT IS PART OF OUR

01:01:12.068 --> 01:01:14.437
VALUES AS CALIFORNIANS. THE

01:01:14.504 --> 01:01:15.605
THIRD THING THAT I'M CONCERNED

01:01:15.671 --> 01:01:17.673
ABOUT IS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE

01:01:17.740 --> 01:01:20.143
BUDGET WE PASS. SETS CALIFORNIA

01:01:20.209 --> 01:01:21.010
ON THE ROAD TO ECONOMIC

01:01:21.077 --> 01:01:23.179
RECOVERY. WE'VE HEARD SOME

01:01:23.246 --> 01:01:25.648
EXTREMELY DISTURBING TESTIMONY

01:01:25.715 --> 01:01:26.416
IN THE LAST COUPLE WEEKS IN OUR

01:01:26.482 --> 01:01:28.284
BUDGET COMMITTEE. THE ECONOMIC

01:01:28.351 --> 01:01:30.520
EXPERTS PROJECT THAT IF THE

01:01:30.586 --> 01:01:31.921
STARS ALIGNED WE COULD HAVE A

01:01:31.988 --> 01:01:33.823
RELATIVELY QUICK ECONOMIC

01:01:33.890 --> 01:01:35.224
RECOVERY FROM THIS RECESSION

01:01:35.291 --> 01:01:36.793
BUT THAT FROM AN EMPLOYMENT

01:01:36.859 --> 01:01:39.462
STANDPOINT. RECOVERY WILL TAKE

01:01:39.529 --> 01:01:41.831
A LONG TIME PERHAPS YEARS

01:01:41.898 --> 01:01:43.399
PERHAPS THREE OR FOUR YEARS

01:01:43.466 --> 01:01:45.334
THAT IS EXTREMELY SOBERING WHEN

01:01:45.401 --> 01:01:46.736
YOU THINK ABOUT. THE HUNDREDS

01:01:46.803 --> 01:01:48.337
OF THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS

01:01:48.404 --> 01:01:50.473
THAT ARE OUT OF WORK RIGHT NOW.

01:01:50.540 --> 01:01:52.208
SO MY QUESTION IS THIS BUDGET.

01:01:52.275 --> 01:01:54.410
GOING TO SET US ON THE ROAD TO

01:01:54.477 --> 01:01:56.145
BREAKING THOSE JOBS BACK AND WE

01:01:56.212 --> 01:01:56.979
HAVE TO REMEMBER WHEN WE TALK

01:01:57.046 --> 01:01:58.748
ABOUT THE BUDGET. THAT WE IN

01:01:58.815 --> 01:02:00.216
GOVERNMENT CANNOT CREATE JOBS

01:02:00.283 --> 01:02:02.118
WE LAY THE FOUNDATION BUT

01:02:02.185 --> 01:02:03.519
INDUSTRIES AND BUSINESSES IN

01:02:03.586 --> 01:02:04.654
CALIFORNIA THE CREATORS OF

01:02:04.720 --> 01:02:05.988
THOSE JOBS THOSE OF THE

01:02:06.055 --> 01:02:07.123
ENTITIES THAT ARE NEEDED GOING

01:02:07.190 --> 01:02:08.691
TO BE TO HIRE. OR CALIFORNIANS

01:02:08.758 --> 01:02:10.893
BACK TO WORK. AND I HAVE SOME

01:02:10.960 --> 01:02:12.061
SERIOUS CONCERNS ABOUT THAT IN

01:02:12.128 --> 01:02:13.329
THIS BUDGET. THE GOVERNOR'S

01:02:13.396 --> 01:02:14.831
PROPOSED RAISING TAXES ON

01:02:14.897 --> 01:02:16.365
BUSINESS OVER FIVE BILLION

01:02:16.432 --> 01:02:18.434
DOLLARS THIS YEAR. AND HE'S

01:02:18.501 --> 01:02:19.602
DOING IT IN A PROGRESSIVE A

01:02:19.669 --> 01:02:21.704
PARTICULARLY REGRESSIVE WAY. BY

01:02:21.771 --> 01:02:23.573
DISALLOWING THE NET OPERATING

01:02:23.639 --> 01:02:25.441
LOSS TO TAX DEDUCTION SO IN

01:02:25.508 --> 01:02:26.375
OTHER WORDS WE'RE GOING TO

01:02:26.442 --> 01:02:29.078
PENALIZE THE COMPANIES THAT ARE

01:02:29.145 --> 01:02:31.147
ALREADY DOING POORLY. HE'S ALSO

01:02:31.214 --> 01:02:32.682
GOING TO CAP THE AMOUNT OF TAX

01:02:32.748 --> 01:02:33.783
CREDITS THE BUSINESSES CAN

01:02:33.850 --> 01:02:35.618
TAKE. WHICH TO ME IS RENEGING

01:02:35.685 --> 01:02:36.986
ON THE PROMISES THAT WE MADE TO

01:02:37.053 --> 01:02:38.287
THOSE BUSINESSES WHEN WE PASS

01:02:38.354 --> 01:02:39.689
THOSE TAX CREDITS. AND THOSE

01:02:39.755 --> 01:02:40.923
PROMISES OF THE BUSINESSES HAVE

01:02:40.990 --> 01:02:42.725
BEEN RELYING ON WHEN THEY PUT

01:02:42.792 --> 01:02:44.227
TOGETHER THE BUSINESS PLAN. FOR

01:02:44.293 --> 01:02:46.062
THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS. AND I

01:02:46.129 --> 01:02:47.530
ALSO THINK WE NEED TO MAKE SURE

01:02:47.597 --> 01:02:48.464
THAT WE SHORE UP OUR

01:02:48.531 --> 01:02:50.066
UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE SYSTEM.

01:02:50.133 --> 01:02:51.501
MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS ARE

01:02:51.567 --> 01:02:53.202
RELYING ON THAT SYSTEM WE NEED

01:02:53.269 --> 01:02:54.370
TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT SYSTEM

01:02:54.437 --> 01:02:56.405
IS HEALTHY. WE HAVE JUST TAKEN

01:02:56.472 --> 01:02:58.341
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. OF LOANS

01:02:58.407 --> 01:02:59.475
FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO

01:02:59.542 --> 01:03:01.344
SHORE UP THAT SYSTEM WE NEED TO

01:03:01.410 --> 01:03:02.578
MAKE SURE WE HAVE A PLAN FOR

01:03:02.645 --> 01:03:04.313
PAYING TAT MONEY BACK. BECAUSE

01:03:04.380 --> 01:03:05.781
IF WE DON'T HAVE A PLAN AND WE

01:03:05.848 --> 01:03:07.650
FAIL TO REPAIR THAT MONEY BACK.

01:03:07.717 --> 01:03:09.485
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WILL DO

01:03:09.552 --> 01:03:10.987
AS THEY HAVE DONE IN THE LAST

01:03:11.053 --> 01:03:13.489
RECESSION. AND IMPOSE PENALTIES

01:03:13.556 --> 01:03:15.158
ON EVERY BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA

01:03:15.224 --> 01:03:16.125
FOR EVERY EMPLOYEE THAT THEY

01:03:16.192 --> 01:03:18.461
HAVE. WE CANNOT ALLOW THAT TO

01:03:18.528 --> 01:03:20.463
HAPPEN. THAT WAS BE PENALIZING

01:03:20.530 --> 01:03:22.265
BUSINESSES WHOSE. ARE ARE NOT

01:03:22.331 --> 01:03:23.499
AT FAULT AT ALL IN THIS PRICES

01:03:23.566 --> 01:03:24.767
BECAUSE WAS ACTION OF THE STATE

01:03:24.834 --> 01:03:26.169
THAT SHUT THEM DOWN. IT WAS AN

01:03:26.235 --> 01:03:27.403
ACTION OF THE STATE BUT TOOK

01:03:27.470 --> 01:03:29.105
THOSE LOANS. AT A NEEDS TO BE

01:03:29.172 --> 01:03:29.872
AN ACTION OF THE STATE THE

01:03:29.939 --> 01:03:33.776
REPAIRS THOSE LOANS SO I THINK

01:03:33.843 --> 01:03:34.410
THAT'S SOMETHING WE NEED TO PAY

01:03:34.477 --> 01:03:35.011
ATTENTION AND- IN THE BUDGET.

01:03:35.077 --> 01:03:36.546
AND THEN LASTLY. I THINK IT'S

01:03:36.612 --> 01:03:37.713
VERY IMPORTANT THIS BUDGET SETS

01:03:37.780 --> 01:03:40.216
US ON A PATH. TO FUTURE SUCCESS

01:03:40.283 --> 01:03:42.685
IN OUR BUDGETS. THE LEGISLATIVE

01:03:42.752 --> 01:03:43.519
ANALYST'S THE DEPARTMENT OF

01:03:43.586 --> 01:03:45.254
FINANCE AGREED ON THE FACT THAT

01:03:45.321 --> 01:03:47.290
THIS BUDGET DEFICIT IS NOT A

01:03:47.356 --> 01:03:49.525
SINGLE YOU'RE ABOUT. WE WILL BE

01:03:49.592 --> 01:03:50.693
FACING ANOTHER BUDGET DEFICIT

01:03:50.760 --> 01:03:52.228
NEXT YEAR PROBABLY OF SIX

01:03:52.295 --> 01:03:53.429
BILLION DOLLARS OR MORE EVEN

01:03:53.496 --> 01:03:54.363
WITH THE CUTS THAT HAVE BEEN

01:03:54.430 --> 01:03:55.398
PROPOSED IN THIS YOU YEAR'S

01:03:55.464 --> 01:03:57.300
BUDGET THE YEAR AFTER THAT IT

01:03:57.366 --> 01:03:58.935
WILL BE EVEN WORSE PERHAPS AS

01:03:59.001 --> 01:03:59.869
MUCH AS SIXTEEN BILLION

01:03:59.936 --> 01:04:01.637
DOLLARS. SO WE NEED TO MAKE

01:04:01.704 --> 01:04:02.405
SURE THAT WE'RE NOT JUST MERELY

01:04:02.471 --> 01:04:03.472
KICKING THE CAN DOWN THE ROAD

01:04:03.539 --> 01:04:04.974
THIS YEAR BECAUSE IT'S JUST

01:04:05.041 --> 01:04:06.375
GOING TO BE HARDER FOR US NEXT

01:04:06.442 --> 01:04:07.510
YEAR. AND THE GOVERNOR'S

01:04:07.577 --> 01:04:08.945
PROPOSING DOING A COUPLE OF

01:04:09.011 --> 01:04:09.912
THINGS THAT I'M VERY CONCERNED

01:04:09.979 --> 01:04:11.681
ABOUT ALONG THOSE LINES FIRST

01:04:11.747 --> 01:04:13.783
OF ALL HE'S PROPOSING OVER TEN

BILLION DOLLARS OF INTER FUND

01:04:15.284 --> 01:04:16.519
BORROWING SO WE'RE BORROWING

01:04:16.586 --> 01:04:18.120
MONEY FROM RESTRICTED FUNDS

01:04:18.187 --> 01:04:19.121
PUTTING IT IN THE GENERAL FUND

01:04:19.188 --> 01:04:20.590
AND PROMISING TO PAY IT BACK

01:04:20.656 --> 01:04:22.825
LATER WITH INTEREST. FOLKS THAT

01:04:22.892 --> 01:04:23.392
IS JUST KICKING THE CAN DOWN

01:04:23.459 --> 01:04:25.094
THE ROAD. ANOTHER THING THAT IS

01:04:25.161 --> 01:04:26.929
PROPOSING IS. FIVE BILLION

01:04:26.996 --> 01:04:28.564
DOLLARS A BUDGET DEFERRALS.

01:04:28.631 --> 01:04:29.498
WHICH JUST MEANS THAT WE'RE

01:04:29.565 --> 01:04:30.700
GOING TO PAY THE BILLS THAT WE

01:04:30.766 --> 01:04:32.802

YEAR'S BILLS INSTEAD OF THIS

NINETEEN PANDEMIC HAS

01:06:35.057 --> 01:06:36.459
FUNDAMENTALLY ALTERED OUR

01:06:39.895 --> 01:06:43.232
ECONOMIC CRISIS. THE US IS

01:06:43.299 --> 01:06:44.667

RECESSION THAT IS EXPECTED TO

01:06:47.169 --> 01:06:49.038
BE WORSE THAN THE GREAT

01:06:49.105 --> 01:06:51.707
RECESSION. CALIFORNIA PERSONAL

01:06:51.774 --> 01:06:53.209

WAS PROJECTED IN JANUARY. ONE

01:07:07.390 --> 01:07:09.859
OF THE MOST ALARMING ASPECTS OF

01:07:09.925 --> 01:07:10.860
THE EARLY MONTHS OF THIS

01:07:10.926 --> 01:07:12.261
RECESSION ARE THE UNEMPLOYMENT

01:07:12.328 --> 01:07:14.730
LEVELS ESPECIALLY AMONG LOWER

01:07:14.797 --> 01:07:17.166
WAGE WORKERS. WHICH IS

01:07:17.233 --> 01:07:19.435
AMPLIFYING THE WAGE DISPARITY

01:07:19.502 --> 01:07:20.770
THAT EXISTED BEFORE THE

01:07:20.836 --> 01:07:24.006
PANDEMIC IT. SINCE FEBRUARY

TWO FIFTEEN POINT 5% IN APRIL

01:07:31.747 --> 01:07:33.516
AND FURTHER INCREASES ARE

01:07:33.582 --> 01:07:36.318
EXPECTED LATER THIS QUARTER.

01:07:36.385 --> 01:07:37.219
JUST FOR A LITTLE BIT OF

01:07:37.286 --> 01:07:39.688
CONTEXT IN THE GREAT RECESSION

01:07:39.755 --> 01:07:41.857

WHICH WAS TWELVE POINT THREE

01:07:46.829 --> 01:07:48.631
PERCENT. SO THE STATE HAS

01:07:48.697 --> 01:07:51.767
REACHED THIS NEW RECORD PEAK

01:07:51.834 --> 01:07:53.869
AND JUST TWO SHORT MONTHS. THIS

01:07:53.936 --> 01:07:55.838
IS AN UNPRECEDENTED CHALLENGE

01:07:55.905 --> 01:07:57.473
FOR CALIFORNIANS BUT ESPECIALLY

01:07:57.540 --> 01:07:58.707

HAPPENED FROM PRIOR RECESSIONS.

01:12:57.139 --> 01:12:58.674
BUT THIS BUDGET DOES RELY ON

01:12:58.741 --> 01:13:00.476

01:27:43.358 --> 01:27:45.159
INFORMATION THAT IS ON THE

01:27:45.226 --> 01:27:46.694
PREVIOUS TABLE BUT IT'S JUST

01:27:46.761 --> 01:27:48.496

01:27:48.563 --> 01:27:50.732
WON'T SPEND TIME ON THIS SLIDE

01:27:50.798 --> 01:27:51.833

KINDERGARTEN TO TWELFTH GRADE-

01:28:04.946 --> 01:28:06.481

MENTIONED TO ME A REVISION DOES

01:28:10.885 --> 01:28:13.655
PROPOSED TO REDUCE THE LEVEL OF

01:28:13.721 --> 01:28:15.390
PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT

01:28:15.456 --> 01:28:16.524
FUNDING TO THE MINIMUM

01:28:16.591 --> 01:28:19.160
GUARANTEE- AND THIS WOULD

01:28:19.227 --> 01:28:21.029
ABSENT ANYTHING ELSE THAT WOULD

01:28:21.095 --> 01:28:22.997
RESULT IN ABOUT A SIX BILLION

01:28:23.064 --> 01:28:24.732
DOLLAR YEAR OVER YEAR DECLINE

01:28:24.799 --> 01:28:28.102
IN FUNDING FOR THE- K. TWELVE

01:28:28.169 --> 01:28:29.337
SCHOOLS. FROM THE CURRENT YEAR

01:28:29.404 --> 01:28:31.873
TO THE BUDGET YEAR. HOWEVER THE

01:28:31.939 --> 01:28:34.709
NAY REVISION DOES INCLUDE

01:28:34.776 --> 01:28:37.145
VARIOUS OFFSETTING. PROPOSALS

01:28:37.211 --> 01:28:38.546
THAT WOULD MITIGATE THE THOSE

01:28:38.613 --> 01:28:40.548
REDUCTIONS I WAS ALREADY

01:28:40.615 --> 01:28:42.383
MENTIONED BUT THESE INCLUDE THE

01:28:42.450 --> 01:28:44.986
USE OF ONE TIME FEDERAL FUNDS.

01:28:45.053 --> 01:28:46.754
AND ALSO THE USE OF DEFERRALS

01:28:46.821 --> 01:28:47.822
WHICH ENABLE THE SCHOOL

01:28:47.889 --> 01:28:49.390
DISTRICTS TO SPEND IT AT A

01:28:49.457 --> 01:28:51.492
LEVEL HIGHER THAN THAN THE

01:28:51.559 --> 01:28:56.464
MINIMUM GUARANTEE.THE NET

01:28:56.531 --> 01:28:58.199
EFFECT OF THESE ADJUSTMENTS ARE

01:28:58.266 --> 01:28:59.967
THAT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE

01:29:00.034 --> 01:29:01.769
CHANGES FROM YEAR TO YEAR.

01:29:01.836 --> 01:29:03.471
ACTUALLY K. TWELVE SPENDING IS

01:29:03.538 --> 01:29:05.973
RELATIVELY FLAT FROM THE

01:29:06.040 --> 01:29:07.542
CURRENT YEAR TO THE BUDGET YEAR.

01:29:07.608 --> 01:29:08.876
AND THEN IN ADDITION TO THAT

01:29:08.943 --> 01:29:10.211
THE MAY REVISION PROPOSES THIS

01:29:10.278 --> 01:29:11.813
NEW SUPPLEMENTAL OBLIGATION

01:29:11.879 --> 01:29:14.048
THAT WOULD BE PAID TO THE

01:29:14.115 --> 01:29:14.615
SCHOOLS OVER THE SUBSEQUENT

01:29:14.682 --> 01:29:18.786
YEARS. THE FIFTY GOING TO PAGE

01:29:18.853 --> 01:29:22.857
FIVE. THIS SLIDE SUMMARIZES THE

01:29:22.924 --> 01:29:23.391
CORVETTE NINETEEN RELATED

01:29:23.458 --> 01:29:26.260
FUNDING. BOTH THE AMOUNTS THAT

01:29:26.327 --> 01:29:28.396
HAVE ALREADY BEEN EXPENDED AND

01:29:28.463 --> 01:29:30.198
IN ADDITION THE PROPOSED AMOUNT

01:29:30.264 --> 01:29:31.966
OF SPENDING IN THE MAY REVISION

01:29:32.033 --> 01:29:34.135
SO IF YOU LOOK AT THIS TABLE

01:29:34.202 --> 01:29:36.104
THE TOP PORTION SUMS TO ABOUT

01:29:36.170 --> 01:29:38.106
TWO POINT TWO BILLION THOSE ARE

01:29:38.172 --> 01:29:38.673
THE FUNDS THAT HAVE ALREADY

01:29:38.740 --> 01:29:40.475
BEEN EXPENDED AND THEN AT THE

01:29:40.541 --> 01:29:43.644
LOWER HALF OF THE TABLE THIS IS

01:29:43.711 --> 01:29:44.212
WHAT IS PROPOSED IN THE MAY

01:29:44.278 --> 01:29:46.614
REVISION. THE DIRECT RESPONSE

01:29:46.681 --> 01:29:48.483
EXPENDITURES FOR THREE POINT

01:29:48.549 --> 01:29:50.518
FIVE BILLION- WERE INCLUDED IN

01:29:50.585 --> 01:29:51.986
THE MAY REVISION AND INITIALLY

01:29:52.053 --> 01:29:53.554
WE HAD VERY LITTLE INFORMATION

01:29:53.621 --> 01:29:55.256
ABOUT WHAT THOSE. PROPOSALS

01:29:55.323 --> 01:29:57.291
ENTAILED. ALTHOUGH WE RECENTLY

01:29:57.358 --> 01:29:58.726
RECEIVED A FINANCE LETTER THAT

01:29:58.793 --> 01:30:01.596
PROVIDED SOME ADDITIONAL

01:30:01.662 --> 01:30:02.930
LIMITED INFORMATION ABOUT THOSE.

01:30:02.997 --> 01:30:04.031
AND THEN YOU'LL SEE HERE THAT

01:30:04.098 --> 01:30:05.266
THE GIRL IS PROPOSING THIS

01:30:05.333 --> 01:30:06.701
COVERT NINETEEN CONTINGENCY

01:30:06.768 --> 01:30:10.037
FUND THAT WOULD BE A TWO POINT

01:30:10.104 --> 01:30:12.173
NINE BILLION DOLLAR FINE. AND

01:30:12.240 --> 01:30:13.674
THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSES TO

01:30:13.741 --> 01:30:15.543
USE CONTROL SECTION LANGUAGE

01:30:15.610 --> 01:30:16.944
WHEN IT COMES TO THE

01:30:17.011 --> 01:30:21.349
EXPENDITURES FROM THAT FUND. SO

01:30:21.415 --> 01:30:23.818
MOVING ON TO SORT OF THE LA-

01:30:23.885 --> 01:30:26.721
ASSESSMENT OF THE PACKAGE AND

01:30:26.788 --> 01:30:29.323
THE SITUATION TO BEGIN WITH. I

01:30:29.390 --> 01:30:31.559
WOULD NOTE THAT ON MAY EIGHTH

01:30:31.626 --> 01:30:34.962
OUR OFFICE PUBLISHED A- SPRING

01:30:35.029 --> 01:30:38.499
FISCAL OUTLOOK. AND YOU KNOW

01:30:38.566 --> 01:30:39.700
THIS IS ACTUALLY SOMEWHAT

01:30:39.767 --> 01:30:41.569
UNUSUAL FOR OUR OFFICE WE

01:30:41.636 --> 01:30:43.304
TYPICALLY PUBLISH AN OUTLOOK IT

01:30:43.371 --> 01:30:45.640
IN NOVEMBER BUT USUALLY NOT ONE

01:30:45.706 --> 01:30:47.708
IN THE SPRING BUT GIVEN HOW

01:30:47.775 --> 01:30:49.777
MUCH HAS CHANGED SINCE JANUARY

01:30:49.844 --> 01:30:51.445
WE FELT THAT IT WAS IMPORTANT

01:30:51.512 --> 01:30:52.547
TO PROVIDE AN UPDATED

01:30:52.613 --> 01:30:53.848
ASSESSMENT OF THE BUDGETARY

01:30:53.915 --> 01:30:56.250
BASS LINE. FOR YOU EVEN IN

01:30:56.317 --> 01:30:57.618
ADVANCE OF RECEIVING THE MAY

01:30:57.685 --> 01:31:00.888
REVISION. AND CONSIDERING THAT

01:31:00.955 --> 01:31:02.723
THERE IS SO MUCH UNCERTAINTY

01:31:02.790 --> 01:31:04.826
OUT IN THE ECONOMY AND IN IN

01:31:04.892 --> 01:31:06.394
THE WORLD IN GENERAL WE

01:31:06.460 --> 01:31:08.596
DEVELOPED OUR- SPRING OUTLOOK

01:31:08.663 --> 01:31:10.631
OR FISCAL OUTLOOK USING TWO

01:31:10.698 --> 01:31:12.934
SCENARIOS. ONE WE WERE CALLING

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:15.102
THE U. SHAPED RECESSION WHERE

01:31:15.169 --> 01:31:16.971
THERE'S A DOWNTURN IN AND IN

01:31:17.038 --> 01:31:19.073
THE COMING MONTHS THE ECONOMY

01:31:19.140 --> 01:31:20.775
EXPERIENCES A STRONGER KIND OF

01:31:20.842 --> 01:31:22.610
MORE ROBUST TYPE OF RECOVERY.

01:31:22.677 --> 01:31:24.212
AND IN THAT SCENARIO THE STATE

01:31:24.278 --> 01:31:26.080
WOULD BE FACING AN EIGHTEEN

01:31:26.147 --> 01:31:28.082
BILLION DOLLAR BUDGET PROBLEM.

01:31:28.149 --> 01:31:29.450
THE OTHER SCENARIO WE

01:31:29.517 --> 01:31:30.585
CONSIDERED WAS SLIGHTLY

01:31:30.651 --> 01:31:32.820
PESSIMISTIC IT'S WHAT WE CALL

01:31:32.887 --> 01:31:34.188
THE L. SHAPE SCENARIO WHERE THE

01:31:34.255 --> 01:31:35.790
ECONOMY WOULD GO DOWN AND THEN

01:31:35.857 --> 01:31:37.558
HAVE A MORE PROTRACTED KIND OF

01:31:37.625 --> 01:31:39.594
A SLOWER TYPE OF RECOVERY. AND

01:31:39.660 --> 01:31:42.663
IN THAT IN THAT SCENARIO THE

01:31:42.730 --> 01:31:43.231
BUDGET PROBLEM IS THIRTY ONE

01:31:43.297 --> 01:31:45.666
BILLION. NOW IN BOTH OF THESE

01:31:45.733 --> 01:31:47.902
SCENARIOS THE MAIN DRIVER OF

01:31:47.969 --> 01:31:49.837
THE BUDGET PROBLEM IS A

01:31:49.904 --> 01:31:50.671
SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN

01:31:50.738 --> 01:31:52.506
REVENUES. IN ARE YOU SHAPE

01:31:52.573 --> 01:31:54.942
SCENARIO IT'S A TWENTY SIX

01:31:55.009 --> 01:31:56.944
BILLION DOLLAR REVENUE DECLINE

01:31:57.011 --> 01:31:59.013
FROM JANUARY ESTIMATES. AND IN

01:31:59.080 --> 01:32:01.048
THE- SHAPE SCENARIO IT'S A

01:32:01.115 --> 01:32:01.616
THIRTY NINE BILLION DOLLAR

01:32:01.682 --> 01:32:03.217
REVENUE DECLINE FROM THE

01:32:03.284 --> 01:32:05.620
JANUARY ESTIMATES. AN IMPORTANT

01:32:05.686 --> 01:32:07.421
THING TO NOTE ABOUT THAT IS

01:32:07.488 --> 01:32:08.723
THAT THE THIRTY NINE BILLION

01:32:08.789 --> 01:32:10.024
DOLLAR REVENUE DECLINE IN OUR

01:32:10.091 --> 01:32:12.393
BILL SHEA SCENARIO IS ACTUALLY

01:32:12.460 --> 01:32:13.861
QUITE SIMILAR IN THE BIG

01:32:13.928 --> 01:32:16.063
PICTURE TO THE GOVERNOR'S.

01:32:16.130 --> 01:32:18.032
FORTY ONE BILLION DOLLAR

01:32:18.099 --> 01:32:18.566
REVENUE DECLINE IN THE MAY

01:32:18.633 --> 01:32:20.468
REVISION. AND AS THE DIRECTOR

01:32:20.534 --> 01:32:22.136
OF FINANCE JUST MENTIONED THE

01:32:22.203 --> 01:32:23.838
MAIN DIFFERENCE IN OUR-

01:32:23.905 --> 01:32:25.072
ULTIMATE BUDGET PROBLEM

01:32:25.139 --> 01:32:26.607
ESTIMATES HAVE TO DO WITH HOW

01:32:26.674 --> 01:32:27.909
WE MEASURE THE STATE'S

01:32:27.975 --> 01:32:31.612
EXPENDITURE BASE. SO MOVING TO

01:32:31.679 --> 01:32:34.015
THE NEXT PAGE. YOU KNOW WHETHER

01:32:34.081 --> 01:32:35.850
YOU. THINK THE STATE INYO

01:32:35.917 --> 01:32:37.218
DEFINED IT AS A THIRTY ONE

01:32:37.285 --> 01:32:38.552
BILLION DOLLAR BUDGET PROBLEM

01:32:38.619 --> 01:32:40.288
OR A FIFTY FOUR BILLION DOLLAR

01:32:40.354 --> 01:32:42.924
PROBLEM PROBLEM. THE MAIN

01:32:42.990 --> 01:32:43.524
MESSAGE OF OUR SPRING OUTLOOK

01:32:43.591 --> 01:32:46.260
WAS THAT. WE THINK YOU SHOULD

01:32:46.327 --> 01:32:47.361
CONSIDER USING A MIX OF

01:32:47.428 --> 01:32:50.331
PROPOSALS A MIX SOLUTION TO

01:32:50.398 --> 01:32:52.767
CLOSE THIS BUDGET PROBLEM. AND

01:32:52.833 --> 01:32:53.267
IN FACT THAT'S WHAT THE

01:32:53.334 --> 01:32:54.602
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSING. HE

01:32:54.669 --> 01:32:56.837
PROVIDES. A PACKAGE THAT

01:32:56.904 --> 01:32:59.407
INCLUDES A PRETTY WELL BALANCED

01:32:59.473 --> 01:33:01.309
MIX OF SOLUTIONS FOR YOU TO

01:33:01.375 --> 01:33:03.544
CONSIDER. THE WE THINK THAT YOU

01:33:03.611 --> 01:33:04.645
MAY WANT TO MAKE SOME

01:33:04.712 --> 01:33:05.846
ADJUSTMENTS TO THOSE TWO SO

01:33:05.913 --> 01:33:07.515
THAT THOSE PARTICULAR

01:33:07.581 --> 01:33:09.650
COMPONENTS BETTER REFLECT YOUR

01:33:09.717 --> 01:33:13.287
PRIORITIES. NOW A COUPLE OF

01:33:13.354 --> 01:33:15.589
SPECIFIC. POINTS I WOULD WANT

01:33:15.656 --> 01:33:18.192
TO MENTION HERE. ON THE

01:33:18.259 --> 01:33:20.227
PROPOSED REVENUE SOLUTIONS THE

01:33:20.294 --> 01:33:21.495
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSING THAT THE

01:33:21.562 --> 01:33:23.731
STATE AUGMENT ITS REVENUES BY

01:33:23.798 --> 01:33:25.733
FOUR POINT FOUR BILLION THE TWO

01:33:25.800 --> 01:33:27.735
MAIN COMPONENTS OF THAT HAVE TO

01:33:27.802 --> 01:33:29.136
DO WITH SUSPENDING THE NET

01:33:29.203 --> 01:33:31.472
OPERATING LOSSES FOR BUSINESSES

01:33:31.539 --> 01:33:32.773
FOR THREE YEARS AND PUTTING A

01:33:32.840 --> 01:33:34.375
LIMIT ON THE TAX CREDITS THAT

01:33:34.442 --> 01:33:36.811
CAN BE TAKEN. IN IN THOSE IN

01:33:36.877 --> 01:33:40.448
THOSE YEARS. NOW INSTANCE SUMS

01:33:40.514 --> 01:33:42.717
IN ONE SENSE THIS IS PERHAPS

01:33:42.783 --> 01:33:44.085
MORE APPEALING THAN A BROAD

01:33:44.151 --> 01:33:45.886
BASED TAX INCREASE BECAUSE

01:33:45.953 --> 01:33:47.788
GENERALLY IT'S VIEWED AS SORT

01:33:47.855 --> 01:33:49.890
OF AN ACCELERATION OF TAXES

01:33:49.957 --> 01:33:51.759
THAT WOULD BE PAID ANYWAY. SO

01:33:51.826 --> 01:33:55.329
IT'S NOT REALLY VIEWED IN SOME

01:33:55.396 --> 01:33:56.497
SOME ANALYSES WOULD SUGGEST

01:33:56.564 --> 01:33:59.033
IT'S NOT AS BURDENSOME AS A

01:33:59.100 --> 01:34:00.835
BROAD BASED TAX INCREASE. ON

01:34:00.901 --> 01:34:02.870
THE OTHER HAND. THE CORPORATION

01:34:02.937 --> 01:34:04.772
TAX IS KNOWN FOR BEING VERY

01:34:04.839 --> 01:34:07.475
DIFFICULT TO PREDICT. AND SO TO

01:34:07.541 --> 01:34:09.643
THE EXTENT THE SOLUTIONS RELY

01:34:09.710 --> 01:34:11.645
ON THE REVENUE FROM THIS SOURCE

01:34:11.712 --> 01:34:14.915
IT BECOMES MORE RISKY TO RELY

01:34:14.982 --> 01:34:17.385
ON THAT SOURCE OF REVENUE. IN

01:34:17.451 --> 01:34:19.553
ADDITION WE THINK THAT THE MAY

01:34:19.620 --> 01:34:21.422
REVISION MIGHT ESTIMATE THESE

01:34:21.489 --> 01:34:22.656
THEREVENUE THAT WOULD COME

01:34:22.723 --> 01:34:23.891
FROM THESE ACTIONS TO BE A

01:34:23.958 --> 01:34:26.627
LITTLE BIT TOO HIGH. SO COULD

01:34:26.694 --> 01:34:27.228
BE SOMEWHAT OPTIMISTIC IN OUR

01:34:27.294 --> 01:34:29.864
JUDGMENT. WHEN IT COMES TO THE

01:34:29.930 --> 01:34:31.132
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED SPENDING

01:34:31.198 --> 01:34:33.300
REDUCTIONS WE THINK SOME ARE

01:34:33.367 --> 01:34:35.336
PRETTY WELL TARGETED OTHERS

01:34:35.403 --> 01:34:38.039
HOWEVER ARE RELATIVELY BLIND

01:34:38.105 --> 01:34:39.974
THERE HAVE KIND OF A AN ACROSS

01:34:40.041 --> 01:34:42.109
THE BOARD QUALITY TO THEM. SO

01:34:42.176 --> 01:34:43.811
I'M THINKING OF THE HIGHER

01:34:43.878 --> 01:34:46.047
EDUCATION BUDGET AND YOU JUST-

01:34:46.113 --> 01:34:47.681
BRANCH AND EMPLOYEE

01:34:47.748 --> 01:34:49.116
COMPENSATION ALL OF THOSE ARE

01:34:49.183 --> 01:34:51.685
SUBJECT 210% REDUCTIONS WE

01:34:51.752 --> 01:34:53.054
THINK YOU MAY WANT TO CONSIDER

01:34:53.120 --> 01:34:55.389
A MORE TARGETED APPROACH IN

01:34:55.456 --> 01:34:59.860
SOME OF THOSE AREAS. MOVING TO

01:34:59.927 --> 01:35:03.731
PAGE EIGHT I WANTED TO COMMENT

01:35:03.798 --> 01:35:06.767
ON THE MULTIPLE YEAR- BUDGET

01:35:06.834 --> 01:35:08.436
OUTLOOK HEARD BUDGET CONDITION

01:35:08.502 --> 01:35:10.704
AND A KEY MESSAGE AARON IN FULL

01:35:10.771 --> 01:35:13.174
AGREEMENT WITH MY COLLEAGUE

01:35:13.240 --> 01:35:13.808
FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE

01:35:13.874 --> 01:35:15.910
THAT THE KEY MESSAGE HERE IS

01:35:15.976 --> 01:35:18.579
THAT UNDER ANY SCENARIO THE

01:35:18.646 --> 01:35:19.880
STATE WOULD APPEAR TO BE FACING

01:35:19.947 --> 01:35:22.650
IS KIND OF A STRUCTURAL PROBLEM

01:35:22.716 --> 01:35:23.184
THERE'S AN ONGOING BUDGET

01:35:23.250 --> 01:35:25.453
PROBLEM. AND WELL THE GOVERNOR

01:35:25.519 --> 01:35:27.021
DOES MAKE PROGRESS ON THIS

01:35:27.088 --> 01:35:28.622
FRONT IT WOULD REDUCE THE

01:35:28.689 --> 01:35:30.825
STRUCTURAL PROBLEM OVER THAT.

01:35:30.891 --> 01:35:33.094
FOR OVER THE FORECAST YEARS. IT

01:35:33.160 --> 01:35:34.495
STILL WOULD LEAVE THE STATE

01:35:34.562 --> 01:35:35.896
UNDER THE UNDER THE

01:35:35.963 --> 01:35:37.331
ADMINISTRATION'S PROJECTIONS IT

01:35:37.398 --> 01:35:39.200
WOULD LEAD TO STAY WITH A LARGE

01:35:39.266 --> 01:35:41.902
DEFICIT IN THE FINAL YEAR

01:35:41.969 --> 01:35:42.436
TWENTY TWENTY THREE TWENTY

01:35:42.503 --> 01:35:43.671
FOUR. NO PART OF THIS IS

01:35:43.737 --> 01:35:44.972
BECAUSE OF THAT LARGE

01:35:45.039 --> 01:35:46.941
SIGNIFICANT NEW SUPPLEMENTAL

01:35:47.007 --> 01:35:48.642
OBLIGATION THAT WOULD BE TO THE

01:35:48.709 --> 01:35:51.378
SCHOOLS. THAT WOULD ADD TEN

01:35:51.445 --> 01:35:52.847
POINT ONE BILLION TO THE STATE

01:35:52.913 --> 01:35:54.815
SPENDING THROUGH IN THE YEARS

01:35:54.882 --> 01:35:58.519
OF THE- OF THE OUTLOOK HORIZON.

01:35:58.586 --> 01:36:00.521
IN ADDITION THERE ARE SOME COST

01:36:00.588 --> 01:36:02.723
SHIFTS IN THE BUDGET SOME OF

01:36:02.790 --> 01:36:04.792
THESE INCLUDE CHANGES TO THE TO

01:36:04.859 --> 01:36:06.827
THE- PENT SUPPLEMENTAL PENSION

01:36:06.894 --> 01:36:08.429
PAYMENTS THAT YOU PROVIDED LAST

01:36:08.496 --> 01:36:10.998
YEAR IN THE BUDGET. AND THEY

01:36:11.065 --> 01:36:12.266
THAT THE CHANGES THE GOVERNOR'S

01:36:12.333 --> 01:36:13.667
PROPOSING ESSENTIALLY HAVE THE

01:36:13.734 --> 01:36:14.802
EFFECT OF ACHIEVING SOME

01:36:14.869 --> 01:36:16.637
SAVINGS IN THE NEAR TERM BUT AT

01:36:16.704 --> 01:36:18.105
THE EXPENSE O CREATING HIGHER

01:36:18.172 --> 01:36:20.608
COSTS OVER THE LONGER TERM AND

01:36:20.674 --> 01:36:23.043
THAT WOULD CONTRIBUTE TO. A

01:36:23.110 --> 01:36:24.845
LONGER TERM STRUCTURAL ISSUE.

01:36:24.912 --> 01:36:26.113
NOW WHEN IT COMES TO FEDERAL

01:36:26.180 --> 01:36:28.582
FUNDING WE DO BELIEVE THAT IT'S

01:36:28.649 --> 01:36:31.118
APPROPRIATE FOR POLICY MAKERS

01:36:31.185 --> 01:36:33.387
TO CONTINUE TO PURSUE- FEDERAL

01:36:33.454 --> 01:36:35.456
AID AND TO THE EXTENT WE GET IT

01:36:35.523 --> 01:36:37.391
THAT COULD HELP THE PROBLEM-

01:36:37.458 --> 01:36:39.393
BUT IN IT'S ALMOST CERTAINLY

01:36:39.460 --> 01:36:41.128
THE CASE THAT EVEN IF. FOURTH

01:36:41.195 --> 01:36:42.963
EVEN IF FEDERAL ASSISTANCE IS

01:36:43.030 --> 01:36:45.666
FORTHCOMING. IT WILL LIKELY BE

01:36:45.733 --> 01:36:47.401
LIMITED TERM IN NATURE ONE OR

01:36:47.468 --> 01:36:49.503
TWO YEARS AT THE MOST. AND IN

01:36:49.570 --> 01:36:51.472
THAT CASE. THE LEGISLATURE WILL

01:36:51.539 --> 01:36:52.773
BE ONCE AGAIN FACED WITH A

01:36:52.840 --> 01:36:54.942
STRUCTURAL ISSUE WHEN THAT

01:36:55.009 --> 01:36:56.777
FUNDING BEGINS TO PHASE OUT. SO

01:36:56.844 --> 01:36:57.711
THAT'S SOMETHING WE THINK

01:36:57.778 --> 01:36:58.846
YOU'LL WANT TO BE KEEPING IN

01:36:58.913 --> 01:37:01.815
MIND AS YOU CONSIDER THE BUDGET.

01:37:01.882 --> 01:37:03.717
FINALLY ON THE LAST PAGE OF MY

01:37:03.784 --> 01:37:05.586
PRESENTATION I WANTED TO.

01:37:05.653 --> 01:37:07.321
PROVIDE A WORD ON THIS THE

01:37:07.388 --> 01:37:08.989
ISSUE OF LEGISLATIVE AUTHORITY

01:37:09.056 --> 01:37:12.593
AND OVERSIGHT. YOUR NECK

01:37:12.660 --> 01:37:14.695
JANUARY BUDGET THE GOVERNOR HAD

01:37:14.762 --> 01:37:18.098
A LOT OF PROPOSALS AND HE'S

01:37:18.165 --> 01:37:19.667
MADE CHANGES TO MANY OF THOSE

01:37:19.733 --> 01:37:22.336
PROPOSALS IN THE MAY REVISION.

01:37:22.403 --> 01:37:24.205
BUT AT THE SAME TIME HE'S ALSO

01:37:24.271 --> 01:37:27.174
RETAINING SOME BIG SIGNIFICANT

01:37:27.241 --> 01:37:29.610
POLICY CHANGES INCLUDING THE

01:37:29.677 --> 01:37:31.478
CREATION OF A NEW DEPARTMENT

01:37:31.545 --> 01:37:32.813
AND THE SIGNIFICANT

01:37:32.880 --> 01:37:34.148
REORGANIZATION OF EXISTING

01:37:34.215 --> 01:37:36.984
DEPARTMENTS. NOW SOME OF THESE

01:37:37.051 --> 01:37:38.519
IDEAS MAY HAVE MERIT. BUT THEY

01:37:38.586 --> 01:37:41.488
ARE SIGNIFICANT COMPLEX MULTI

01:37:41.555 --> 01:37:43.724
YEAR UNDERTAKINGS IN MANY MANY

01:37:43.791 --> 01:37:46.026
INSTANCES. AND CONSIDERING THAT

01:37:46.093 --> 01:37:47.962
THE LEGISLATURE WAS ON RECESS

01:37:48.028 --> 01:37:50.297
FOR PART OF THE SPRING. AND YOU

01:37:50.364 --> 01:37:51.565
ARE UNABLE TO HOLD THE SAME

01:37:51.632 --> 01:37:53.033
LEVEL OF HEARINGS THAT YOU

01:37:53.100 --> 01:37:55.202
WOULD IN A NORMAL YEAR. WE

01:37:55.269 --> 01:37:56.537
THINK IT'S REASONABLE THAT YOU

01:37:56.604 --> 01:37:58.239
WOULD CONSIDER DEFERRING ACTING

01:37:58.305 --> 01:38:01.508
ON THOSE ITEMS MAYBE INTO THE

01:38:01.575 --> 01:38:02.543
POLICY PROCESS OR EVEN A

01:38:02.610 --> 01:38:04.044
SUBSEQUENT BUDGET YOU. YOU HAVE

01:38:04.111 --> 01:38:06.981
A FULLY CONSIDERED THEM. AND

01:38:07.047 --> 01:38:09.817
THEN LAST WHEN IT COMES TO THE

01:38:09.883 --> 01:38:11.785
PROPOSALS FOR THE COVERT

01:38:11.852 --> 01:38:14.321
NINETEEN SPENDING. WE HAVE SOME

01:38:14.388 --> 01:38:16.190
SERIOUS RESERVATIONS ABOUT THE

01:38:16.257 --> 01:38:17.358
DEGREE OF LATITUDE THAT THE

01:38:17.424 --> 01:38:18.859
ADMINISTRATION IS SEEKING FROM

01:38:18.926 --> 01:38:21.895
THE LEGISLATURE. WE APPRECIATE

01:38:21.962 --> 01:38:24.098
THE NEED FOR THE STATE TO. BE

01:38:24.164 --> 01:38:26.000
NIMBLE AND ITS RESPONSE TO THE

01:38:26.066 --> 01:38:28.569
PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY. BUT

01:38:28.636 --> 01:38:30.237
THE PROPOSED USE OF THE CONTROL

01:38:30.304 --> 01:38:31.505
SECTION PROVISIONS RISK

01:38:31.572 --> 01:38:32.873
UNDERMINING THIS THE

01:38:32.940 --> 01:38:35.209
LEGISLATURE'S AUTHORITY AND ITS

01:38:35.276 --> 01:38:36.610
ABILITY TO FULFILL ITS

01:38:36.677 --> 01:38:38.579
OVERSIGHT FUNCTION. AT A

01:38:38.646 --> 01:38:39.880
MINIMUM WE THINK YOU MAY WANT

01:38:39.947 --> 01:38:41.715
TO CONSIDER AMENDING THE

01:38:41.782 --> 01:38:43.651
LANGUAGE AND SOME OF THESE

01:38:43.717 --> 01:38:46.420
CONTROL SECTION PROPOSALS. AND

01:38:46.487 --> 01:38:47.821
WE REALLY DO VIEW THIS AS AN

01:38:47.888 --> 01:38:49.523
IMPORTANT ISSUE BECAUSE IT

01:38:49.590 --> 01:38:51.792
REALLY SPEAKS TO THE CORE ISSUE

01:38:51.859 --> 01:38:53.360
OF THE BALANCE OF POWER BETWEEN

01:38:53.427 --> 01:38:54.995
THE EXECUTIVE AND LEGISLATIVE

01:38:55.062 --> 01:38:57.564
BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT. AND FOR

01:38:57.631 --> 01:38:58.666
THAT REASON WE THINK IT

01:38:58.732 --> 01:39:01.368
WARRANTS YOUR ATTENTION. SO

01:39:01.435 --> 01:39:03.270
WITH THAT I'LL BE HAPPY TO TAKE

01:39:03.337 --> 01:39:04.805
QUESTIONS AS APPROPRIATE. THANK

01:39:04.872 --> 01:39:10.611

01:40:23.117 --> 01:40:24.151
RELATIONSHIP OF TRUST WITH THE

01:40:24.218 --> 01:40:25.486
GOVERNOR. BUT ALSO THE

01:40:25.552 --> 01:40:27.421
GOVERNOR'S ASKING FOR

01:40:27.488 --> 01:40:27.921
EXTRAORDINARY ABILITY TO

01:40:27.988 --> 01:40:30.124
ALLOCATE. SOURCES OUTSIDE OF

01:40:30.190 --> 01:40:32.159
THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS AND I'M

01:40:32.226 --> 01:40:33.327
WONDERING THE SPECIFICALLY THE

01:40:33.394 --> 01:40:34.962
CONTROLLING WHICH IS SECTIONS

01:40:35.028 --> 01:40:37.064
ELEVEN POINT. EIGHTY SIX ELEVEN

01:40:37.131 --> 01:40:37.798
POINT NINETY AND THE MAY

01:40:37.865 --> 01:40:39.933
REVISED WHAT. DOES THE

DEPARTMENT SEEK TO ACCOMPLISH

01:40:40.901 --> 01:40:42.035
THERE THAT YOU DON'T FEEL COULD

01:40:42.102 --> 01:40:43.804
BE ACCOMPLISHED IN PARTNERSHIP

01:40:43.871 --> 01:40:46.840
WITH THE LEGISLATURE. YES SO I

01:40:46.907 --> 01:40:48.342
MEAN AND SPECIFICALLY RELATED

01:40:48.409 --> 01:40:49.610
TO THE CONTROL SECTIONS AROUND

01:40:49.676 --> 01:40:51.845
THE FEDERAL FUNDS- I THINK IT'S

01:40:51.912 --> 01:40:53.180
IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT WE'VE

01:40:53.247 --> 01:40:54.148
BEEN HAVING A LOT OF

01:40:54.214 --> 01:40:55.916
CONVERSATIONS. WITH THE

01:40:55.983 --> 01:40:58.018
LEGISLATIVE. STAFF ABOUT HOW TO

01:40:58.085 --> 01:41:00.421
MODIFY THOSE TO INSURE THAT

01:41:00.487 --> 01:41:02.022
THERE'S OVERSIGHT. THERE'S BEEN

01:41:02.089 --> 01:41:04.491
SO MUCH CHANGE IN THE FEDERAL

01:41:04.558 --> 01:41:06.093
GUIDANCE ESPECIALLY AROUND THE

01:41:06.160 --> 01:41:08.295
CORONA VIRUS RELIEF FUND- IT

01:41:08.362 --> 01:41:09.563
WAS REALLY IMPORTANT FOR US TO

01:41:09.630 --> 01:41:10.397
BE ABLE TO BUILD AND

01:41:10.464 --> 01:41:12.065
FLEXIBILITY INCLUDING THE WEEK

01:41:12.132 --> 01:41:13.333
OF THE BUDGET RELEASE THERE WAS

01:41:13.400 --> 01:41:15.469
EVEN NEW- GUIDANCE THAT STILL

01:41:15.536 --> 01:41:16.737
HAS NOT BEEN MEMORIALIZED IN

01:41:16.804 --> 01:41:18.172
ANY KIND OF WRITTEN FORMAT.

01:41:18.238 --> 01:41:19.339
THAT WE COULD UTILIZE THE

01:41:19.406 --> 01:41:21.108
CORONA VIRUS REALLY FUNDS TO

01:41:21.175 --> 01:41:23.744
ACTUALLY- MATCH THE FEMALE AT

01:41:23.811 --> 01:41:25.512
THE FEMALE AS THE STAFFORD ACT

01:41:25.579 --> 01:41:27.281
EXPENDITURES SO. GIVEN THAT WE

01:41:27.347 --> 01:41:29.683
WEREN'T REALLY COMPLETELY SURE

01:41:29.750 --> 01:41:30.884
ABOUT HOW WE WOULD ALLOCATE

01:41:30.951 --> 01:41:32.186
THOSE MONIES WE KNOW THAT WE

01:41:32.252 --> 01:41:33.620
HAVE GUIDANCE FROM THE U. S.

01:41:33.687 --> 01:41:34.955
TREASURY THAT'S VERY SPECIFIC

01:41:35.022 --> 01:41:36.056
ABOUT WHAT HOW IT NEEDS TO BE

01:41:36.123 --> 01:41:37.991
SPENT- WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE

01:41:38.058 --> 01:41:39.226
THAT THERE WAS OF SUFFICIENT

01:41:39.293 --> 01:41:40.894
FLEXIBILITY. I THINK WE'VE

01:41:40.961 --> 01:41:42.463
ALREADY LOOKED AT MAKING SURE

01:41:42.529 --> 01:41:43.664
THAT THERE IS A NOTIFICATION

01:41:43.730 --> 01:41:46.600
PERIOD PROP- AT NOTIFICATION A

01:41:46.667 --> 01:41:49.169
BUILT IN TO THOSE AFFECTS. SO

01:41:49.236 --> 01:41:51.138
THAT THAT EVERYONE UNDERSTANDS

01:41:51.205 --> 01:41:52.372
WHAT THE FINAL OUTCOME IS THAT

01:41:52.439 --> 01:41:54.408
THAT THAT THAT ONE PIECE- THE

01:41:54.475 --> 01:41:56.510
CROWN OF THE COVERT NINETEEN

01:41:56.577 --> 01:41:58.479
PANDEMIC IT'S HAS SUCH A

01:41:58.545 --> 01:42:00.147
DIFFERENT ARC THANMANY

01:42:00.214 --> 01:42:04.451
EMERGENCIES. YOU KNOW A-

01:42:04.518 --> 01:42:07.354
EARTHQUAKE A FLOOD TIRES WITH

01:42:07.421 --> 01:42:08.121
EXPERIENCE THE LAST SEVERAL

01:42:08.188 --> 01:42:09.756
YEARS THEY USUALLY ARE HAPPENS

01:42:09.823 --> 01:42:10.891
OVER THE PERIOD OF THE DAY ARE

01:42:10.958 --> 01:42:12.659
YOU DAYS OR- A COP WEEKS THIS

01:42:12.726 --> 01:42:14.695
IS A DISASTER AT THAT THAT

01:42:14.761 --> 01:42:15.896
SPENDING MUCH LONGER AND SO I

01:42:15.963 --> 01:42:17.064
THINK THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF

01:42:17.130 --> 01:42:18.899
BACK AND FORTH IN A LOT OF GOOD

01:42:18.966 --> 01:42:20.667
CONVERSATIONS. OVER THE LAST

01:42:20.734 --> 01:42:23.837
FEW WEEKS ABOUT HOW AND AS- HOW

01:42:23.904 --> 01:42:25.072
THAT THE HOW THIS IS DIFFERENT

01:42:25.138 --> 01:42:27.541
AND HOW IT FRANKLY IT IS STILL.

01:42:27.608 --> 01:42:29.409
REALLY THE SAME. EVERYTHING

01:42:29.476 --> 01:42:32.312
THAT THE GOVERNOR- THE ACTIONS

01:42:32.379 --> 01:42:34.181
THAT THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE IN

01:42:34.248 --> 01:42:35.849
THE GOVERNOR HAS TAKEN AND ALSO

01:42:35.916 --> 01:42:38.252
WHAT I HAVE ARE. AND HAITIANS

01:42:38.318 --> 01:42:40.020
THAT PROVIDE. ALL BASED ON

01:42:40.087 --> 01:42:41.889
STATUTE AND SPECIFICALLY THE

01:42:41.955 --> 01:42:44.057
EMERGENCY SERVICES ACT THEN HE

01:42:44.124 --> 01:42:47.961
CONTROL. SECTIONS THAT ARE

01:42:48.028 --> 01:42:48.529
EMBEDDED IN THE BUDGET THE

01:42:48.595 --> 01:42:49.129
ANNUAL BUDGET ACCESS GOVERN.

01:42:49.196 --> 01:42:50.430
THE WRITTEN Q. THAT WE MAKE.

01:42:50.497 --> 01:42:51.632
ALLEGED WHICH ARE ALL OF THOSE

01:42:51.698 --> 01:42:53.700
HAVE BEEN FOLLOWED. BUT WE ALSO

01:42:53.767 --> 01:42:55.669
HEAR AND UNDERSTAND THAT THAT

01:42:55.736 --> 01:42:57.504
THAT'S NOT ENOUGH YOU KNOW AND

01:42:57.571 --> 01:42:58.939
THERE HAS BEEN A LOT MORE

01:42:59.006 --> 01:43:00.941
EXECUTIVE ACTION HERE THAN

01:43:01.008 --> 01:43:02.576
MAYBE AND PRIOR LONG

01:43:02.643 --> 01:43:05.112
EMERGENCIES. LIKE OF LIKE THE

01:43:05.178 --> 01:43:06.513
DROUGHT FOR EXAMPLE THE DROUGHT

01:43:06.580 --> 01:43:07.881
EMERGENCY DID LAST FOR SEVERAL

01:43:07.948 --> 01:43:10.551
YEARS- BUT IT WAS IT WAS STILL

01:43:10.617 --> 01:43:11.985
MORE GEOGRAPHICALLY ISOLATED

01:43:12.052 --> 01:43:14.187
THAN THIS EMERGENCY IS. SO A

01:43:14.254 --> 01:43:15.422
LOT OF REALLY UNIQUE

01:43:15.489 --> 01:43:16.957
CIRCUMSTANCES THAT I THINK ARE

01:43:17.024 --> 01:43:21.295
CAUSING A LOT OF- GOOD. DEBATE

01:43:21.361 --> 01:43:22.729
BUT I THINK THAT YOU KNOW THE

01:43:22.796 --> 01:43:23.997
ADMINISTRATION WOULD MAINTAIN

01:43:24.064 --> 01:43:24.965
THAT THE POWERS OF THE

01:43:25.032 --> 01:43:26.266
EMERGENCY SERVICES ACTOR

01:43:26.333 --> 01:43:29.970
ABSOLUTELY FUNDAMENTAL. TO THE

01:43:30.037 --> 01:43:32.573
EXECUTIVE BRANCH BEEN ABLE TO

01:43:32.639 --> 01:43:34.007
TAKE ACTION SWIFTLY TO. PROTECT

01:43:34.074 --> 01:43:35.976
PUBLIC HEALTH AND- PUBLIC SAFE.

01:43:36.043 --> 01:43:37.444
AND SO THOSE ARE THE THINGS

01:43:37.511 --> 01:43:38.645
THAT AND THAT THE DEBATE AND

01:43:38.712 --> 01:43:40.714
BALANCE THAT I THINK- WILL HAVE

01:43:40.781 --> 01:43:41.949
TO CONTINUE TO HAVE A DIALOGUE

01:43:42.015 --> 01:43:43.817
ON. AS WE PUT TOGETHER THIS

01:43:43.884 --> 01:43:45.652
BUDGET THANK YOU VOTE I AGREE

01:43:45.719 --> 01:43:46.753
YOU HIT THE NAIL ON THE HEAD

01:43:46.820 --> 01:43:47.321
THAT THIS IS THE START OF A

01:43:47.387 --> 01:43:49.823
DISCUSSION. AND I THINK YOU'VE

01:43:49.890 --> 01:43:50.390
HEARD LOUD AND CLEAR THAT WE

01:43:50.457 --> 01:43:52.759
WANT TO PRESERVE OUR ABILITY.

01:43:52.826 --> 01:43:54.194
TO EXERCISE OF LEGISLATIVE

01:43:54.261 --> 01:43:55.395
OVERSIGHT THAT WE ARE EXPECTED

01:43:55.462 --> 01:43:57.698
TO. ABA A SECOND QUESTION I

01:43:57.764 --> 01:43:59.766
HAVE FOR YOU REGARDS THE TITLE

01:43:59.833 --> 01:44:00.968
TWELVE LOANS THAT THE

01:44:01.034 --> 01:44:02.135
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE HAS

01:44:02.202 --> 01:44:03.470
RECENTLY TAKEN FROM THE FEDERAL

01:44:03.537 --> 01:44:04.838
GOVERNMENT TO SHORE UP OUR

01:44:04.905 --> 01:44:05.973
STATE UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE

01:44:06.039 --> 01:44:07.708
SYSTEM. SO WHAT IS THE

01:44:07.774 --> 01:44:09.743
DEPARTMENT'S THINKING ABOUT HOW

01:44:09.810 --> 01:44:11.311
THOSE LOANS ARE GOING TO BE

01:44:11.378 --> 01:44:12.412
REPAID I KNOW THAT THE CARE IS

01:44:12.479 --> 01:44:14.381

01:44:14.448 --> 01:44:15.616
THE TIME BEING WHICH IS YOU CAN

01:44:15.682 --> 01:44:16.917
WHICH IS HELPFUL BUT IT DOES

01:44:16.984 --> 01:44:18.285
NOT HELP US PAYING THAT ACT AND

01:44:18.352 --> 01:44:19.820
SO I'M WONDERING WHAT HOW THE

01:44:19.886 --> 01:44:21.455
YEAH I KNOW SOMETHING THAT WE

01:44:21.521 --> 01:44:23.256
ARE TRACKING VERY CLOSELY AND

01:44:23.323 --> 01:44:25.959
THAT. WE'RE VERY CAN ABOUT- AND

01:44:26.026 --> 01:44:29.863
THE NUMBER OF UNEMPLOYMENT.

01:44:29.930 --> 01:44:30.497
PEOPLE ON A PLANE EMPLOYMENT IS

01:44:30.564 --> 01:44:33.834
REALLY AS- AT NUMBER- SOMETHING

01:44:33.900 --> 01:44:34.501
THAT THE STATE HAS NOT SEEN

01:44:34.568 --> 01:44:36.470
BEFORE. UNDERTHE LAST

01:44:36.536 --> 01:44:37.804
RECESSION WE DID HAVE TO TAKE

01:44:37.871 --> 01:44:39.606
OUT MULTIPLE TENS OF BILLIONS

01:44:39.673 --> 01:44:40.741
OF LOANS FROM THE FEDERAL

01:44:40.807 --> 01:44:42.542
GOVERNMENT AND WE DID THAT. AND

01:44:42.609 --> 01:44:45.479
WE DID REPAY THAT- OVER TIME.

01:44:45.545 --> 01:44:48.315
AND THOSE INTEREST COSTS- WOULD

01:44:48.382 --> 01:44:50.584
IT WORK OUT BORN BY THE STATE.

01:44:50.651 --> 01:44:51.952
LATE CHECK A CLEAR THOUGH

01:44:52.019 --> 01:44:53.153
WITHOUT GOING INTO COLLOQUY

01:44:53.220 --> 01:44:54.354
RIGHT AND THAT HAS A WE

01:44:54.421 --> 01:44:56.490
REPEATED. THE STATE REPAIRS

01:44:56.556 --> 01:44:58.191

01:44:58.258 --> 01:44:59.793
STATE RIGHT- FORCED RIGHT PAY

01:44:59.860 --> 01:45:01.895
THE PRINCIPAL THE SAME TIME.

01:45:01.962 --> 01:45:04.798
THERE IS A MECHANISM IT'S

01:45:04.865 --> 01:45:08.201
CALLED THE FOOD THAT. THAT IS

01:45:08.268 --> 01:45:09.202
THAT AS- BUSINESSES THAT. THE

01:45:09.269 --> 01:45:10.737
NUMBER OF YEARS IN WHICH THAT

01:45:10.804 --> 01:45:13.407
THE LOAN IS OUTSTANDING- ONE

01:45:13.473 --> 01:45:15.409
THING THAT WAS IN THE CARE IS

01:45:15.475 --> 01:45:18.278
ACCESS. THAT THE EXTENSION OF

01:45:18.345 --> 01:45:20.080
THE INTEREST FREE UNTIL

01:45:20.147 --> 01:45:21.915
DECEMBER IS ABSOLUTELY HELPFUL.

01:45:21.982 --> 01:45:23.550
WE WOULD LIKE A MUCH LONGER

01:45:23.617 --> 01:45:25.419
PERIOD OF INTEREST FREE LOANS

01:45:25.485 --> 01:45:26.586
FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

01:45:26.653 --> 01:45:27.220
THIS TIME GIVEN THE

01:45:27.287 --> 01:45:29.890
EXTRAORDINARY. STRESS ON ALL

01:45:29.956 --> 01:45:30.691
AND EMPLOYMENT SYSTEMS

01:45:30.757 --> 01:45:31.958
THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY

01:45:32.025 --> 01:45:34.461
INCLUDING CALIFORNIA- WE WILL

01:45:34.528 --> 01:45:36.463
BE WORKING THERE IS A DELAY IN

01:45:36.530 --> 01:45:37.564
TERMS OF THE TIME IN WHICH IT

01:45:37.631 --> 01:45:40.734
REQUIRES THE STATE TO PAY BACK-

01:45:40.801 --> 01:45:43.170
WITH INTEREST THOSE LOANS- BUT-

01:45:43.236 --> 01:45:44.304
THAT WILL BE SOMETHING THAT.

01:45:44.371 --> 01:45:46.606
THAT THAT IT WILL BE EITHER ON

01:45:46.673 --> 01:45:48.375
THE GENERAL FUND OR IN YEARS

01:45:48.442 --> 01:45:50.143
PAST THE STATE DISABILITY

01:45:50.210 --> 01:45:51.945
INSURANCE FUND ABLE TO MAKE

01:45:52.012 --> 01:45:53.880
SOME OF THOSE INTO. BY THE-

01:45:53.947 --> 01:45:57.751
PAYMENTS THE SOME AT. FIND I'M

01:45:57.818 --> 01:45:58.418
SO THOSE WILL BE TYPES OF

01:45:58.485 --> 01:45:59.186
THINGS THAT THE STATE WILL BE.

01:45:59.252 --> 01:46:00.387
WITH FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL. AND

01:46:00.454 --> 01:46:02.189
ALSO BE MINDFUL OF THE IMPACT

01:46:02.255 --> 01:46:04.024
ON BUSINESSES AROUND SO THAT

01:46:04.091 --> 01:46:04.825
THAT'S THE INTEREST AND THE

01:46:04.891 --> 01:46:06.560
PRINCIPAL. AND THE PRINCIPAL IS

01:46:06.626 --> 01:46:08.361
IT'S ALL IS ALL A PART OF THAT

01:46:08.428 --> 01:46:10.530
THE TAX THE TAXES ON BUSINESSES

01:46:10.597 --> 01:46:12.299
THAT THAT SUPPORT THAT PROGRAM

01:46:12.365 --> 01:46:14.534
RIGHT SO DOES THE STATE INTEND

KNOW. AS FAR AS EARLY EDUCATION

01:53:22.228 --> 01:53:23.897
THIS BUDGET UNFORTUNATELY THE

01:53:23.963 --> 01:53:25.465
MAY REVISED ESTIMATES OVER ONE

01:53:25.532 --> 01:53:26.866
BILLION DOLLARS IN PROGRESS

01:53:26.933 --> 01:53:27.700
WE'VE MADE THE PAST COUPLE

01:53:27.767 --> 01:53:29.102
YEARS ON CHILD CARE AND

01:53:29.169 --> 01:53:31.271
PRESCHOOL. IT'S A TOUGH CALL

01:53:31.337 --> 01:53:32.272
BUT THE RIGHT CHOICE I WILL

01:53:32.338 --> 01:53:33.940
KNOW IN THE MAY REVISED TO

01:53:34.007 --> 01:53:34.874
REPURPOSE MANY OF THESE

01:53:34.941 --> 01:53:37.177
DOLLARS. FROM ONE TIME DOLLARS

01:53:37.243 --> 01:53:39.145
FOR EASY- INFRASTRUCTURE THE

01:53:39.212 --> 01:53:40.980
PRE SCHOOL EXPANSION TO PROP UP

01:53:41.047 --> 01:53:43.016
THE EXISTING CHILD CARE SLOTS

01:53:43.082 --> 01:53:44.150
BUT ONE THING WE NEED TO TALK

01:53:44.217 --> 01:53:45.185
ABOUT WHICH IS CRITICALLY

01:53:45.251 --> 01:53:46.286
IMPORTANT THAT WE REJECT AND

01:53:46.352 --> 01:53:48.354
THAT'S THE CUTS. TO RATES FOR

01:53:48.421 --> 01:53:50.356
BOTH CHILD CARE AND PRESCHOOL

01:53:50.423 --> 01:53:53.092
PROGRAMS. THESE SANDERS FAMILY

01:53:53.159 --> 01:53:55.161
BASED PROGRAMS CENTERS WERE

01:53:55.228 --> 01:53:56.963
BARELY AFLOAT BEFORE BECAUSE OF

01:53:57.030 --> 01:53:58.765
THE NINETEEN. AND WITH THESE

01:53:58.831 --> 01:54:00.333
RATE CUTS IT REALLY WILL BE THE

01:54:00.400 --> 01:54:01.801
DEATH KNELL TO THESE PROGRAMS

01:54:01.868 --> 01:54:02.702
AND THAT MEANS PEOPLE LOSING

01:54:02.769 --> 01:54:04.337
THEIR JOBS FOR LONELY WOMEN

01:54:04.404 --> 01:54:06.306
WOMEN OF COLOR AS WE KNOW. THE

01:54:06.372 --> 01:54:07.407
WHAT IS THIS MEAN TO RE OPENING

01:54:07.473 --> 01:54:08.741
OUR ECONOMY. WHAT DOES THIS

01:54:08.808 --> 01:54:10.877
MEAN TO HAVING PEOPLE GO BACK

01:54:10.944 --> 01:54:12.478
TO WORK THEY'RE BOTH RELATED.

01:54:12.545 --> 01:54:15.248
OUR COLLEGES ALSO- FACE TOUGH

01:54:15.315 --> 01:54:17.483
CHALLENGES. WE HAVE INCREASED

01:54:17.550 --> 01:54:20.220
COST OUR CAMPUSES AT A TIME.

01:54:20.286 --> 01:54:21.888
WHEN REVENUES ARE DECREASING

01:54:21.955 --> 01:54:23.089
WE'VE SEEN REVENUE CUTS AND

01:54:23.156 --> 01:54:24.958
HOUSING AND PARKING SO IT'S A

01:54:25.024 --> 01:54:25.525
DOUBLE DOUBLE WHAMMY FOR OUR

01:54:25.592 --> 01:54:27.994
CAMPUSES. SO GO BACK TO OUR

01:54:28.061 --> 01:54:29.128
REALITY CHECK ON THIS ON THIS

01:54:29.195 --> 01:54:31.030
BUDGET. AND MY QUESTION IS WHEN

01:54:31.097 --> 01:54:32.031
I WOULD ASK DEPARTMENT OF

01:54:32.098 --> 01:54:35.301
FINANCE AND LA TO ENTERTAIN.

01:54:35.368 --> 01:54:37.403
WITHOUT OPEN SCHOOLS STABLE

01:54:37.470 --> 01:54:38.771
CHILD CARE AND ACCESSIBLE

01:54:38.838 --> 01:54:40.440
HIGHER EDUCATION CAN WE

01:54:40.506 --> 01:54:42.542
REASONABLY REOPEN CALIFORNIA

01:54:42.609 --> 01:54:44.244
AND SEE AN ECONOMIC RECOVERY.

01:54:44.310 --> 01:54:47.380
THANK YOU. THANK YOU WE'RE NOT

BARBARA YEAH YOU HAVE TO THE

01:54:54.254 --> 01:54:55.822
SCHOOLS QUESTION IS ONE THAT

01:54:55.888 --> 01:54:57.490
THAT REALLY KEEPS ME UP AT

01:54:57.557 --> 01:54:58.691
NIGHT I HAVE SMALL CHILDREN

01:54:58.758 --> 01:55:00.927
MYSELF AND THE SOCIAL

01:55:00.994 --> 01:55:03.029
DISTANCING PROTOCOLS THAT THE

01:55:03.096 --> 01:55:04.998
PUBLIC HEALTH DOCTORS.

01:55:05.064 --> 01:55:06.766
RECOMMEND TO KEEP US ALL SAFE

01:55:06.833 --> 01:55:08.268
YOU KNOW ARE ARE HARD TO REALLY

01:55:08.334 --> 01:55:09.535
WRAP YOUR HEAD AROUND IN AN

01:55:09.602 --> 01:55:11.604
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL ENVIRONMENT-

01:55:11.671 --> 01:55:13.106
BUT THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS

01:55:13.172 --> 01:55:14.707
BEEN WORKING VERY HARD WITH THE

01:55:14.774 --> 01:55:16.442
DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND

01:55:16.509 --> 01:55:19.312
WITH THAT THE SCHOOL FIELD- TO

01:55:19.379 --> 01:55:22.715
PUT FORTH GUIDANCE- TO HELP

RE OPENING OF SCHOOLS THIS

01:55:26.352 --> 01:55:28.288
FALL- THE FOUR POINT. BILLION

IN FEDERAL FUNDS IN IT THAT WAS

01:55:29.856 --> 01:55:32.058
REALLY DESIGNED TO HELP TO

01:55:32.125 --> 01:55:33.593
ADDRESS SPECIFICALLY THE

01:55:33.660 --> 01:55:35.628
LEARNING LOSS MITIGATION THE

01:55:35.695 --> 01:55:36.996
NECESSARY STEPS THAT SCHOOLS

01:55:37.063 --> 01:55:39.332
ARE GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE A TO

01:55:39.399 --> 01:55:40.667
REOPEN SAFELY ENTERTAIN

SAFE SO- THAT'S I AM YOU KNOW I

01:55:50.877 --> 01:55:52.745

THAT THE SCHOOLS BEING OPEN IS

01:55:54.614 --> 01:55:55.882
REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT AND

01:55:55.948 --> 01:55:57.283
IT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU KNOW

01:55:57.350 --> 01:55:58.718
SCHOOL DISTRICTS ACROSS THE

01:55:58.785 --> 01:56:00.787
STATE ARE GOING BE GRAPPLING

01:56:00.853 --> 01:56:01.888
WITH- WITH THEIR LABOR

01:56:01.954 --> 01:56:03.189
ORGANIZATIONS AND WITH THE

01:56:03.256 --> 01:56:05.158
PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS LOCALLY

01:56:05.224 --> 01:56:06.326
AND WE HOPE TO GIVE GUIDANCE

THAT'LL TO PROVIDE A AND HOW

01:56:09.662 --> 01:56:12.465
THEY CAN DO IT SAFELY AND

01:56:12.532 --> 01:56:14.367
ALLEN'S ALL OF THOSE THINGS BUT

01:56:14.434 --> 01:56:16.336
IT'S WHAT THE REALLY BIG

01:56:16.402 --> 01:56:18.271
STRUGGLES- AT. THIS PANDEMIC IS

01:56:18.338 --> 01:56:20.940
COSTING IT IS ACT ON SCHOOLS

01:56:21.007 --> 01:56:22.442
AND THEN THE ENTIRE THAT HAD

01:56:22.508 --> 01:56:25.745
CHILDREN AND THEIR PARENTS.

01:56:25.812 --> 01:56:28.014
WORK SO THAT. HOW WE REALLY TRY

01:56:28.081 --> 01:56:30.116

IT'S OFTEN THAT ARE BUDGETS ARE

01:56:54.874 --> 01:56:55.808
NEXT OF OUR VALUE AND APHORISM

01:56:55.875 --> 01:56:56.943
HAS NEVER BEEN APPARENT NO MORE

01:56:57.009 --> 01:56:59.579
IMPORTANT THAN NOW AS WE SEEK

01:56:59.645 --> 01:57:00.913
TO ADDRESS THE BUDGETARY FALL

01:57:00.980 --> 01:57:03.316
OUT OF A PANDEMIC THAT IS A

01:57:03.383 --> 01:57:07.720
HEALTH ECONOMIC SOCIAL JUSTICE

01:57:07.787 --> 01:57:09.722
AND ENVIRONMENTAL CRISIS. LET

01:57:09.789 --> 01:57:10.656
US BEAR IN MIND THAT THE

01:57:10.723 --> 01:57:12.859
PANDEMIC HAS ITS ROOTS IN THE

01:57:12.925 --> 01:57:14.293
ENVIRONMENT WHERE WARMING

01:57:14.360 --> 01:57:16.295
CLIMATES CONSTRAINTS ON HABITAT

01:57:16.362 --> 01:57:18.998
AND BIO BIO DIVERSITY LEGAL AND

01:57:19.065 --> 01:57:21.134
ILLEGAL TRADE IN WILD ANIMALS

01:57:21.200 --> 01:57:23.403
HAVE ALL PLAYED A ROLE. SO I'M

01:57:23.469 --> 01:57:24.570
FRUSTRATED WITH THE

01:57:24.637 --> 01:57:25.805
ADMINISTRATION'S MAY REVISION

01:57:25.872 --> 01:57:27.407
PROPOSALS FOR NATURAL

01:57:27.473 --> 01:57:29.609
RESOURCES. NOW I UNDERSTAND

01:57:29.675 --> 01:57:32.111
THAT TOUGH CUTS ARE NEEDED AND

01:57:32.178 --> 01:57:33.846
WE ALL HAVE TO DO WITH LESS.

01:57:33.913 --> 01:57:36.449
BUT WHAT IS HAPPENING HERE IS

01:57:36.516 --> 01:57:37.984
EIGHTY FUNDING OF ENVIRONMENTAL

01:57:38.050 --> 01:57:41.020
PROTECTIONS AND WE CAN'T FORGET

01:57:41.087 --> 01:57:42.789
THAT IN THESE PERILOUS TIMES TO

01:57:42.855 --> 01:57:44.690
COPE WITH NINETEEN CRISIS. HAS

01:57:44.757 --> 01:57:46.659
BEEN HARDER ON THOSE WHO ARE

01:57:46.726 --> 01:57:49.095
ALREADY SUFFERING FOR EXAMPLE

01:57:49.162 --> 01:57:50.696
WITHOUT ACCESS THOSE WITHOUT

01:57:50.763 --> 01:57:52.398
ACCESS TO CLEAN WATER AND CLEAN

01:57:52.465 --> 01:57:55.701
AIR. THE MAY REVISION CONTAINS

01:57:55.768 --> 01:57:57.570
NUMEROUS FUND SHIFTS AND LOANS

01:57:57.637 --> 01:57:59.238
IN ORDER TO RELIEVE PRESSURE

01:57:59.305 --> 01:58:00.706
FROM THE GENERAL FUND.

01:58:00.773 --> 01:58:02.708
SIMULTANEOUSLY THE PROPOSAL'S

01:58:02.775 --> 01:58:04.277
PLACE US IN A POSITION WHERE WE

01:58:04.343 --> 01:58:05.778
HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN CLEAN

01:58:05.845 --> 01:58:08.047
AIR OR WILDLIFE CONSERVATION

01:58:08.114 --> 01:58:10.049
AND A GOOD EXAMPLE OF THIS IS

01:58:10.116 --> 01:58:11.517
THIS IS PLANTING THE

01:58:11.584 --> 01:58:12.885
SUPPLANTING OF GENERAL FUND

01:58:12.952 --> 01:58:15.254
EXPENDITURES. WITH EIGHTY EIGHT

01:58:15.321 --> 01:58:17.256
POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS

01:58:17.323 --> 01:58:17.857
FROM THE AIR POLLUTION CONTROL

01:58:17.924 --> 01:58:20.393
ACCOUNT. THIS ACCOUNT IS FOR

01:58:20.460 --> 01:58:21.561
THE REMEDIATION OF AIR

01:58:21.627 --> 01:58:25.064
POLLUTION. NOT TO FIX OUR

01:58:25.131 --> 01:58:26.999
GENERAL FUND CASH FLOW PROBLEM

01:58:27.066 --> 01:58:28.634
ANOTHER EXAMPLE IS THE PROPOSED

01:58:28.701 --> 01:58:30.169
ROLLBACK OF THE HABITAT

01:58:30.236 --> 01:58:31.471
CONSERVATION FUND WHICH

01:58:31.537 --> 01:58:33.306
EARMARKED IN MARCH THIRTY

01:58:33.372 --> 01:58:35.374
MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY FOR A

01:58:35.441 --> 01:58:36.776
VARIETY OF CONSERVATION

01:58:36.843 --> 01:58:39.178
EFFORTS. THE ADMINISTRATION IS

01:58:39.245 --> 01:58:40.947
COUPLING THIS ROLL BACK WITH

01:58:41.013 --> 01:58:42.548
THE SHIFT OF EIGHTEEN POINT

01:58:42.615 --> 01:58:43.616
NINE MILLION DOLLARS ON AN

01:58:43.683 --> 01:58:45.618
ONGOING BASIS FROM THE WILD

01:58:45.685 --> 01:58:47.854
LIFE CONSERVATION BOARD TO THE

01:58:47.920 --> 01:58:49.522
DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE

01:58:49.589 --> 01:58:51.624
AND IN THE FACT THEY'RE SAYING

01:58:51.691 --> 01:58:52.959
WE EITHER GIVE THIS MONEY THE

01:58:53.025 --> 01:58:55.127
WILDLIFE CONSERVATION BOARD OR

01:58:55.194 --> 01:58:56.462
WE GET THIS TO THE DEPARTMENT

01:58:56.529 --> 01:58:58.664
OF FISH AND WILDLIFE AND- WELL

01:58:58.731 --> 01:59:00.233
I THINK THE F. W. CERTAINLY

01:59:00.299 --> 01:59:01.934
NEEDS ADDITIONAL FUNDING.

01:59:02.001 --> 01:59:03.336
TAKING FROM ANOTHER SISTER

01:59:03.402 --> 01:59:04.637
DEPARTMENT CONDUCTING

01:59:04.704 --> 01:59:06.739
COMPLIMENTARY WORK IS SIMPLY

01:59:06.806 --> 01:59:08.608
NOT THE RIGHT APPROACH AND

01:59:08.674 --> 01:59:10.009
FINALLY WHILE WE'RE TALKING

01:59:10.076 --> 01:59:11.043
ABOUT THE NEED TO BECOME

01:59:11.110 --> 01:59:12.912
RESILIENT TO THE CHANGING

01:59:12.979 --> 01:59:15.281
CLIMATE THE ADMINISTRATION IS

01:59:15.348 --> 01:59:17.350
PROPOSING A THIRTY THREE POINT

01:59:17.416 --> 01:59:19.085
SEVEN MILLION BASELINE.

01:59:19.151 --> 01:59:20.620
REDUCTION FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF

01:59:20.686 --> 01:59:21.787
FISH AND WILDLIFE AND A

01:59:21.854 --> 01:59:24.023
REDUCTION TO THE IMPLEMENTATION

01:59:24.090 --> 01:59:25.291
OF THE SUSTAINABLE GROUND WATER

01:59:25.358 --> 01:59:27.159
MANAGEMENT ACT WHICH IS A

01:59:27.226 --> 01:59:29.695
PROGRAM TO BRING GETTING TO

01:59:29.762 --> 01:59:30.396
BRING OUR GROUNDWATER TABLE

01:59:30.463 --> 01:59:33.766
BACK INTO BALANCE. I WORRY THAT

01:59:33.833 --> 01:59:34.934
THESE FUNCHESS AND REDUCTIONS

01:59:35.001 --> 01:59:36.269
WILL HAVE AN OVERALL REGRESSIVE

01:59:36.335 --> 01:59:38.771
IMPACT ON ALL OF OUR CRITICAL

01:59:38.838 --> 01:59:41.641
ENVIRONMENTAL EXPENDITURES

01:59:41.707 --> 01:59:43.809
EFFORTS AND SUCCESSES. MEMBERS

01:59:43.876 --> 01:59:45.578
I SHARE MANY OF THE CONCERNS

01:59:45.645 --> 01:59:47.013
THAT WILL BE EXPRESSED ABOUT

01:59:47.079 --> 01:59:49.215
OTHER AREAS OF OUR BUDGET. AS

01:59:49.282 --> 01:59:50.483
WE APPROPRIATELY FOCUS

01:59:50.550 --> 01:59:51.951
ATTENTION AND BUDGETARY

01:59:52.018 --> 01:59:53.419
RESOURCES ON IMPORTANT ISSUES

01:59:53.486 --> 01:59:55.221
LIKE HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS

01:59:55.288 --> 01:59:57.390
EDUCATION PUBLIC SAFETY AND

01:59:57.456 --> 01:59:59.892
HEALTH. I HOPE THE AT THE ADMIT

01:59:59.959 --> 02:00:02.728
THAT THE ADMINISTRATION WILL

02:00:02.795 --> 02:00:03.329
HEED THIS CALL ABOUT THE MANY

02:00:03.396 --> 02:00:04.997
CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN

02:00:05.064 --> 02:00:06.332
EXPRESSED ABOUT THE CRITICALLY

02:00:06.399 --> 02:00:08.234
IMPORTANT ENVIRONMENTAL WORK.

02:00:08.301 --> 02:00:09.969
THAT WE MUST CONTINUE TO DO ON

02:00:10.036 --> 02:00:12.171
BEHALF OF THE HEALTH. AND

REALIZE IT DOESN'T RESULT. IN

02:06:36.455 --> 02:06:38.657
MORE OF ARGUES BEING CHARGED AS

02:06:38.724 --> 02:06:40.326
ADULTS RATHER THAN STATE ONCE

02:06:40.392 --> 02:06:41.660
AGAIN GETTING THE CARE AND

02:06:41.727 --> 02:06:42.928
SERVICE THAT WE BELIEVE ME.

02:06:42.995 --> 02:06:44.863
THIS IS NOT BEEN THOUGHT OUT WE

02:06:44.930 --> 02:06:46.298
HAVE NOT HAD DISCUSSIONS WE HAD

02:06:46.365 --> 02:06:48.100
LOTS OF DISCUSSIONS LAST YEAR.

02:06:48.167 --> 02:06:49.501
THAT WOULD NOT FRUITFUL DID NOT

02:06:49.568 --> 02:06:52.304
PROVE TO GIVE US THE ACTION WE

02:06:52.371 --> 02:06:55.040
NEED AND NOW BEING ASKED IN IN

02:06:55.107 --> 02:06:55.674
A MATTER OF MINUTES A SUBURBAN.

02:06:55.741 --> 02:06:58.410
BASICALLY MOVE ALL OF OUR THE

02:06:58.477 --> 02:06:59.211
DIGITAL JUSTICE DEPARTMENTS TO

02:06:59.278 --> 02:07:01.046
THE COUNTY WITHOUT A PLAN WITH

02:07:01.113 --> 02:07:02.815
ANY DIRECTION AS TO WHAT IT

02:07:02.881 --> 02:07:03.582
WOULD LOOK LIKE. AND THAT

02:07:03.649 --> 02:07:07.152
BRINGS US GREAT CONCERN. TO

02:07:07.219 --> 02:07:08.187
PROTECT LEGISLATIVE. THE FROM

02:07:08.253 --> 02:07:09.722
PREVIOUS YEARS WE HAD IN. WE'VE

02:07:09.788 --> 02:07:10.856
OFTEN TALKED ABOUT ALL THE

02:07:10.923 --> 02:07:12.324
THINGS THAT IS SO ESSENTIAL AS

02:07:12.391 --> 02:07:13.258
WE MOVE FORWARD IN AS WE HAVE

02:07:13.325 --> 02:07:14.493
REDUCES TO. THE PRISON

02:07:14.560 --> 02:07:16.295
POPULATION WANT TO MAKE SURE

02:07:16.362 --> 02:07:17.463
THAT WHAT WE'RE DOING IS

02:07:17.529 --> 02:07:19.198
CORRECT AND SOMETIMES THESE.

02:07:19.264 --> 02:07:20.866
WERE POSES COME OUT OF. OUT OF

02:07:20.933 --> 02:07:22.501
THE BLUE IS AS A RESULT OF THAT

02:07:22.568 --> 02:07:23.469
WE DO NOT HAVE THE SAME LEVEL

02:07:23.535 --> 02:07:25.237
OF CONFIDENCE. IN MAKING SURE

02:07:25.304 --> 02:07:26.338
THAT WE HAVE SPOTTED OUT

02:07:26.405 --> 02:07:28.173
CAREFULLY NOT JUST FINANCIALLY

02:07:28.240 --> 02:07:30.209
THE PROGRAMMATIC LATE. WE ARE

02:07:30.275 --> 02:07:31.710
CONCERNED OF COURSE ABOUT THE

02:07:31.777 --> 02:07:33.479
OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL. WE

02:07:33.545 --> 02:07:34.446
HAVE NOT BECAUSE OF INSPECTOR

02:07:34.513 --> 02:07:35.447
GENERAL THE COULD NOT DO

02:07:35.514 --> 02:07:36.682
INSPECTIONS BECAUSE IT DID HAVE

02:07:36.749 --> 02:07:38.183
STAFFING. SO LAST YEAR WE

02:07:38.250 --> 02:07:40.219
FOUGHT TO BASICALLY- STAFF

02:07:40.285 --> 02:07:41.920
OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL.

02:07:41.987 --> 02:07:43.922
AND THEY'VE NOW HARD TO STAFF.

02:07:43.989 --> 02:07:45.557
AND THE RECOMMENDATION IS TO

02:07:45.624 --> 02:07:47.426
GET RID OF ALL OF THE STAFF AND

02:07:47.493 --> 02:07:48.060
REDUCE THE OFFICE OF INSPECTOR

02:07:48.127 --> 02:07:50.629
GENERAL. WHICH WE FIND TO BE OF

02:07:50.696 --> 02:07:52.531
GREAT CONCERN AS WE TALK ABOUT

02:07:52.598 --> 02:07:54.733
CLOSING PRISONS. MORE LIKELY

02:07:54.800 --> 02:07:56.101
WOULD GIVE THAT TO AND THEN THE

02:07:56.168 --> 02:07:57.102
INSPECTOR GENERAL. SO TO MAKE

02:07:57.169 --> 02:07:58.704
SURE THAT THOSE THINGS THAT WE

02:07:58.771 --> 02:07:59.772
PUT IN PLACE A HOUSING FOR

02:07:59.838 --> 02:08:02.041
PRISONERS LEAVING. AND A NUMBER

02:08:02.107 --> 02:08:03.442
OF OTHER THINGS THAT ARE STILL

02:08:03.509 --> 02:08:04.710
IN PLACE. I WANNA MAKE SURE

02:08:04.777 --> 02:08:06.078
THAT OUR COURTS TO LOOK ONCE

02:08:06.145 --> 02:08:08.080
AGAIN FUNDED ADEQUATELY. AND

02:08:08.147 --> 02:08:09.815
THAT WE DO NOT GET RID OF MUCH

02:08:09.882 --> 02:08:10.716
OF THE THINGS THAT REQUIRE

02:08:10.783 --> 02:08:13.452
EQUAL ACCESS TO JUSTICE IN THE

02:08:13.519 --> 02:08:14.253
DEPENDENCY COOL INSTEAD OF THE

02:08:14.319 --> 02:08:16.188
YEAR. OF WE HAVE A NUMBER OF

02:08:16.255 --> 02:08:17.956
THINGS IN THE SYSTEM BUT WE

02:08:18.023 --> 02:08:20.492
WANT TO RECOGNIZE THE FACT THAT

02:08:20.559 --> 02:08:21.193
WE HAVE MADE GREAT STRIDES IN

02:08:21.260 --> 02:08:22.761
PUBLIC SAFETY. TEL AND IS KNOWN

02:08:22.828 --> 02:08:27.800
PROBLEM THAT WE'RE. IN TRYING

02:08:27.866 --> 02:08:28.634
TO GET INTO REHABILITATION DOES

02:08:28.700 --> 02:08:29.635
KIND OF A THAT IMPORT. WE

02:08:29.701 --> 02:08:30.202
CANNOT LOSE SIGHT OF THAT IN

02:08:30.269 --> 02:08:30.836
THE- OF SIMPLY. A REDUCING THE

02:08:30.903 --> 02:08:32.071
BUDGET AND HAVE TO CONTINUE TO

02:08:32.137 --> 02:08:33.305
PUSH TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE

02:08:33.372 --> 02:08:34.706
PROGRAMS ARE INCLUDED. IN THE

02:08:34.773 --> 02:08:36.842
CUTS. IN THE CONVERSATION THANK

02:08:36.909 --> 02:08:39.711
YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CALDERON.

02:08:39.778 --> 02:08:41.046
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND I

02:08:41.113 --> 02:08:41.880
ONE THING BOTH THE DEPARTMENT

02:08:41.947 --> 02:08:43.649
FINANCES WAS LA A FOR COMING IN

02:08:43.715 --> 02:08:45.818
PRESENTING- BEFORE US MY

02:08:45.884 --> 02:08:46.718
QUESTION IS JUST REALLY QUICKLY

02:08:46.785 --> 02:08:49.054
ON- THE RATE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE.

02:08:49.121 --> 02:08:50.422
IN CALIFORNIA HAVE YOU LOOKED

02:08:50.489 --> 02:08:51.723
INTO SEEING IF THERE'S GOING TO

02:08:51.790 --> 02:08:53.292
BE ANY TYPE OF A REBOUND. AS WE

02:08:53.358 --> 02:08:54.827
CAN AS WE BEGIN TO REOPEN THE

02:08:54.893 --> 02:08:56.128
ECONOMY PEOPLE GO BACK TO WORK.

02:08:56.195 --> 02:08:57.196
IF YOU LOOK TO SEE IF THERE'S

02:08:57.262 --> 02:08:57.996
ANYTHING TO BE ANY ANY

02:08:58.063 --> 02:08:59.998
REBOUNDING- AND THAT RIGHT AND

02:09:00.065 --> 02:09:01.366
EMPLOYMENT RATE TO SEE A DROP-

02:09:01.433 --> 02:09:02.768
AND THEN ALSO GIVEN THE CURRENT

02:09:02.835 --> 02:09:04.336
SITUATION THE BUDGET AS IS

02:09:04.403 --> 02:09:04.970
BEING PROPOSED THAT IN THE MAY

02:09:05.037 --> 02:09:07.139
REVISED- IF THE BUDGET WERE TO

02:09:07.206 --> 02:09:09.174
PASS AS IS- WHAT WOULD YOU

02:09:09.241 --> 02:09:10.809
EXPECT THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE-

02:09:10.876 --> 02:09:12.711
TO BE. BEYOND THAT IF EITHER OF

02:09:12.778 --> 02:09:14.079
IT THAT I'M BY BOTH OF YOU TO

02:09:14.146 --> 02:09:15.714
ANSWER- BUT JUST WANTING IF

02:09:15.781 --> 02:09:16.415
THERE'S BEEN ANY THOUGHT INTO

02:09:16.482 --> 02:09:18.050
WHAT THAT'S GONNA LOOK LIKE. AS

02:09:18.117 --> 02:09:21.753
WE RE OPEN AND THEN WHAT THAT

02:09:21.820 --> 02:09:22.354
WOULD LOOK LIKE AT THIS BUDGET

02:09:22.421 --> 02:09:26.525
WOULD PASS AS IS. IF THE FATHER.

02:09:26.592 --> 02:09:29.294
YES SO WE DO ASSUME THAT THE

02:09:29.361 --> 02:09:31.196
UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IS GOING TO

02:09:31.263 --> 02:09:32.865
DECLINE- THROUGHOUT THE COURSE

02:09:32.931 --> 02:09:34.833
OF THE YEAR I'M OUR FORECAST

02:09:34.900 --> 02:09:37.369
ASSUMES THE PEAK THIS QUARTER-

02:09:37.436 --> 02:09:39.271
ADD THE SECOND QUARTER OF THE

02:09:39.338 --> 02:09:40.706
AT TWENTY TWENTY BUT WE DO

02:09:40.772 --> 02:09:42.307
ASSUME THAT IT THAT IT STARTS

02:09:42.374 --> 02:09:44.143
TO DECLINE I'M GOING FORWARD AS

02:09:44.209 --> 02:09:46.178
THE ECONOMY RE OPENS- OUR

02:09:46.245 --> 02:09:47.980
FORECAST DOES NOT ASSUME A

02:09:48.046 --> 02:09:49.615
SECOND WAVE IN THE SECOND SET

02:09:49.681 --> 02:09:52.718
OF CLOSURES- WE DID WE DID DO

02:09:52.784 --> 02:09:54.453
AN EXTENDED SHUTDOWN OF

02:09:54.520 --> 02:09:57.089
SCENARIO- BUT THAT IS NOT WHAT

02:09:57.156 --> 02:10:00.159
THE BUDGET IS BASED ON- SO I DO

02:10:00.225 --> 02:10:01.927
THINK THAT- YOU KNOW WE HOPE

02:10:01.994 --> 02:10:03.061
THAT AS THE RE OPENING

02:10:03.128 --> 02:10:05.164
CONTINUES- THAT. THAT MORE

02:10:05.230 --> 02:10:06.798
PEOPLE WILL BE ABLE TO RETURN

02:10:06.865 --> 02:10:09.902
TO WORK- AND WE DO ASSUME- AN

02:10:09.968 --> 02:10:11.937
18% OVERALL UNEMPLOYMENT RATE

02:10:12.004 --> 02:10:13.272
FOR THE ENTIRE TWENTY TWENTY

02:10:13.338 --> 02:10:14.473
YEAR BUT WE'RE ASSUMING THAT

02:10:14.540 --> 02:10:16.675
THERE'S A THERE'S A PEAK- THIS

02:10:16.742 --> 02:10:19.044
QUARTER- I HAVE OVER TWENTY

02:10:19.111 --> 02:10:21.513
FOUR PERCENT- SO IT IS VERY

02:10:21.580 --> 02:10:23.615
BLEAK- THAT THOSE ARE

02:10:23.682 --> 02:10:24.917
UNEMPLOYMENT NUMBERS OF WE HAVE

02:10:24.983 --> 02:10:29.087
NOT SEEN IN MODERN HISTORY AND-

02:10:29.154 --> 02:10:30.489
AND THERE'S A LOT OF

02:10:30.556 --> 02:10:32.591
UNCERTAINTY TO JUST THIS LAST

02:10:32.658 --> 02:10:33.659
MONTH THERE ARE ACTUALLY TWO

02:10:33.725 --> 02:10:35.761
MIL AND- IF PEOPLE WHO LEFT THE

02:10:35.827 --> 02:10:37.696
JOB MARKET THERE'S NOT JUST

02:10:37.763 --> 02:10:38.864
PEOPLE WERE FILING FOR

02:10:38.931 --> 02:10:40.098
UNEMPLOYMENT BUT THERE ARE

02:10:40.165 --> 02:10:41.266
PEOPLE WHO HAVE. ESSENTIALLY

02:10:41.333 --> 02:10:43.001
DROPPED OUT OF THE WORK FORCE

02:10:43.068 --> 02:10:45.070
AND ARE NOT NO LONGER LOOKING-

02:10:45.137 --> 02:10:46.805
SO THERE'S A THERE'S A LOT OF

02:10:46.872 --> 02:10:47.973
DATA THAT EVERYONE IS LOOKING

02:10:48.040 --> 02:10:50.209
AT AND REALLY UNDERSTAND- THE

02:10:50.275 --> 02:10:52.611
TRUE IMPACT ON EMPLOYMENT AND-

02:10:52.678 --> 02:10:54.146
MOTHERS UNCERTAINTY WE DO

02:10:54.213 --> 02:10:57.849
ASSUME THAT IT'S GOING TO GET

02:10:57.916 --> 02:11:00.886
BETTER. FROM WHERE IT IS TODAY.

02:11:00.953 --> 02:11:04.256
AND IN THE- LA OWES ANALYSIS I

02:11:04.323 --> 02:11:06.491
WOULD THINK THE MOST COMPARABLE

02:11:06.558 --> 02:11:08.594
WOULD BE THE L. SHAPE SCENARIO.

02:11:08.660 --> 02:11:10.095
IN THAT CASE WE ALSO THINK THE

02:11:10.162 --> 02:11:11.630
SECOND QUARTER THE ONE WE'RE IN

02:11:11.697 --> 02:11:12.864
NOW WOULD BE THE PEAK

02:11:12.931 --> 02:11:14.933
UNEMPLOYMENT RATE. IN THAT IN

02:11:15.000 --> 02:11:16.702
THATTHAT IN THIS QUARTER WOULD

02:11:16.768 --> 02:11:19.304
BE EIGHTEEN PERCENT- AND THEN

02:11:19.371 --> 02:11:20.706
BEGIN TO GRADUALLY TRANSITION

02:11:20.772 --> 02:11:23.508
DOWN AND BUT- STILL BY THE END

02:11:23.575 --> 02:11:25.811
OF OUR FORECAST PERIOD. WE

02:11:25.877 --> 02:11:28.380
WOULD BE STILL AT. DOUBLE DIGIT

02:11:28.447 --> 02:11:30.916
10% UNEMPLOYMENT BY TWENTY

02:11:30.983 --> 02:11:33.952
TWENTY TWO- YOU KNOW A COUPLE

02:11:34.019 --> 02:11:36.455
OF IT IS. FOR IS YOU KNOW

02:11:36.521 --> 02:11:38.257
DIFFICULTIES WITH IT IS THAT

02:11:38.323 --> 02:11:40.092
THE DATA COMING IN. YOU KNOW

02:11:40.158 --> 02:11:41.827
ONCE A MONTH AND ITS REPORTING

02:11:41.893 --> 02:11:43.395
ON THE PRIOR MONTH SO THERE'S A

02:11:43.462 --> 02:11:45.764
LAG. ONE THING WE'RE KEEPING A

02:11:45.831 --> 02:11:48.667
VERY CLOSE EYE ON. THE WEEKLY

02:11:48.734 --> 02:11:49.301
NEW UNEMPLOYMENT CLAIMS

02:11:49.368 --> 02:11:51.670
NUMBERS. AND KEEPING OUR EYE

02:11:51.737 --> 02:11:55.073
ON- HOW MANY- TOTAL PEOPLE ARE

02:11:55.140 --> 02:11:57.075
STILL ON UNEMPLOYMENT.

02:11:57.142 --> 02:11:59.544
INSURANCE BENEFITS AND TO THE

02:11:59.611 --> 02:12:01.713
EXTENT WE START TO SEE THOSE

02:12:01.780 --> 02:12:04.049
NUMBERS COME DOWN THAT WOULD BE

02:12:04.116 --> 02:12:07.152
SOME REASON FOR OPTIMISM. AND

02:12:07.219 --> 02:12:09.354
THERE ARE I MEAN I THINK ONE

02:12:09.421 --> 02:12:10.822
THING WE'RE FACED WITH AT THIS

02:12:10.889 --> 02:12:12.090
TIME IS THE POSSIBILITY THAT

02:12:12.157 --> 02:12:14.593
THE ECONOMY. COULD HAVE SOME

02:12:14.660 --> 02:12:16.194
SOMEWHAT OF A THIRTY THREE A

02:12:16.261 --> 02:12:18.430
REBOUND AS AS THE- SUMMER

02:12:18.497 --> 02:12:20.132
MONTHS GO ON AND IF YOU BEGIN

02:12:20.198 --> 02:12:21.767
TO RE OPEN WE COULD SEE SOME

02:12:21.833 --> 02:12:23.869
JOB GROWTH NUMBERS. AND SO THE

02:12:23.935 --> 02:12:25.837
TREND MIGHT LOOK MORE FAVORABLE

02:12:25.904 --> 02:12:28.206
BUT STILL THE- UNDERLINED LEVEL

02:12:28.273 --> 02:12:30.075
OF UNEMPLOYMENT COULD REMAIN

02:12:30.142 --> 02:12:33.779
YOU KNOW DRAMATICALLY- HI SO.

02:12:33.845 --> 02:12:36.081
THOSE ARE THE ITEMS WERE

02:12:36.148 --> 02:12:37.549
WATCHING. AND WHAT WE'RE

02:12:37.616 --> 02:12:40.919
THINKING ABOUT IT AT THIS TIME.

02:12:40.986 --> 02:12:42.587
THANK YOU WE'RE NEXT GOING TO

02:12:42.654 --> 02:12:55.300
GO TO A MISS WALDRON. THANK YOU

02:12:55.367 --> 02:12:59.204
MISTER CHAIRMAN. JOB AN

02:12:59.271 --> 02:13:00.906
ECONOMIC RECOVERY IS OF COURSE

02:13:00.972 --> 02:13:04.176
THOSE OF ITS CENTRAL AND- I

02:13:04.242 --> 02:13:05.577
JUST WANTED TO TOUCH ON A

02:13:05.644 --> 02:13:07.779
COUPLE OF KEY BUDGET ASKS THAT

02:13:07.846 --> 02:13:09.047
I THINK A REALLY IMPORTANT THAT

02:13:09.114 --> 02:13:11.049
WE THAT DON'T GET LOST IN THE

02:13:11.116 --> 02:13:13.318
SHUFFLE- IN PARTICULAR THE

02:13:13.385 --> 02:13:14.820
WILDFIRE RISKS ARE STILL WITH

02:13:14.886 --> 02:13:17.289
US- I'VE SUBMITTED A TWENTY

02:13:17.356 --> 02:13:18.590
FOUR MILLION DOLLAR REQUESTED

02:13:18.657 --> 02:13:19.925
BUDGET SUB THREE FOR THE

IGNORING PURE SCIENCE. IN FAVOR

02:23:05.944 --> 02:23:07.779
OF POLITICAL SCIENCE. IT FEELS

02:23:07.845 --> 02:23:09.013
LIKE WE JUST DUSTED OFF THE

02:23:09.080 --> 02:23:10.782
PLAN FOR THE LAST RECESSION OR

02:23:10.848 --> 02:23:12.617
USING THE SAME PLAYBOOK. WE

02:23:12.684 --> 02:23:14.686
MADE HUGE MISTAKES. AND WE PLAN

02:23:14.752 --> 02:23:16.754
TO REPEAT THEM. THEY'RE ALSO

02:23:16.821 --> 02:23:18.656

02:23:18.723 --> 02:23:21.592
ON THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. WITH

02:23:21.659 --> 02:23:21.960

WHO CAN LEAST AFFORD IT AND WHO

02:23:29.300 --> 02:23:31.269

ABOUT DIABETES. FOUR MILLION

02:24:53.317 --> 02:24:55.953

FEDERAL MASS. PARTICIPANTS ARE

02:25:16.874 --> 02:25:18.443
LESS LIKELY TO DEVELOP TYPE TWO

02:25:18.509 --> 02:25:19.977
DIABETES BUT IT APPEARS THAT

02:25:20.044 --> 02:25:21.245
THE STATE WOULD RATHER JUST ADD

02:25:21.312 --> 02:25:22.880
TO THE OVER THREE POINT SIX.

02:25:22.947 --> 02:25:25.049

RECIPIENTS WHO ARE DIABETIC.

02:25:29.821 --> 02:25:31.589
THIS IS NUTS. THE BUDGET ALSO

02:25:31.656 --> 02:25:32.623
CALLS FOR THE ELIMINATION OF

02:25:40.131 --> 02:25:41.499
SO IMPORTANT A WOUND CARE TO

WITH DIABETES. THIS IS REALLY

02:25:49.807 --> 02:25:51.576
PENNY WISE AND POUND FOOLISH.

02:25:51.642 --> 02:25:52.677

02:25:57.181 --> 02:25:58.583
MANY OF MY CONSTITUENTS IN

SOMEWHERE ELSE THAT WILL

02:26:11.295 --> 02:26:13.231
DEVASTATE PROVIDER NETWORKS. SO

NEXT YEAR A HEIGHTENED

02:36:02.152 --> 02:36:03.187
AWARENESS THAT MAYBE IF A CHILD

02:36:03.253 --> 02:36:04.822

IN THE BUDGET YEAR. TWELVE

02:45:03.093 --> 02:45:03.660
EIGHTEEN TWENTY EIGHTEEN TWENTY

02:45:03.727 --> 02:45:04.294
NINETEEN HOW BRIGHT COLLEGE WAS

02:45:04.361 --> 02:45:05.562

02:45:05.629 --> 02:45:08.131
DOLLARS AN ON GOING GOING FUNDS

02:45:08.198 --> 02:45:09.466
AND A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS

02:45:09.532 --> 02:45:12.002
IN ONE TIME ZONES THAT COULD BE

02:45:12.068 --> 02:45:13.970
SPENT OVER SEVEN YEAR PERIOD.

02:45:14.037 --> 02:45:15.238
SINCE THEN THE ONE HUNDRED

02:45:15.305 --> 02:45:16.506
MILLION DOLLR IN ONE TIME

02:45:16.573 --> 02:45:18.241
FUNDING HAS NOT BEEN TOUCHED

02:45:18.308 --> 02:45:20.076

ACTUAL PROGRAM WELL THE

02:45:26.816 --> 02:45:28.418
ADMINISTRATION HAS PROPOSED A

02:45:28.485 --> 02:45:31.021
CUT TO EXISTING FUNDING I THINK

02:45:31.087 --> 02:45:32.822
WE NEED TO GO MUCH DEEPER.

02:45:32.889 --> 02:45:35.392

ELIMINATE FUNDING TO CALIBRATE

02:45:36.993 --> 02:45:39.462
ENTIRELY ELIMINATING CALIBRATE

02:45:39.529 --> 02:45:41.164

HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND

02:45:57.681 --> 02:45:58.214
DOLLARS BECAUSE THE I THOUGHT

02:45:58.281 --> 02:46:00.250
IT WOULD NOT BE NEEDED TO

02:46:00.317 --> 02:46:02.419
PLACES WHERE THIS MONEY COULD

02:46:02.485 --> 02:46:04.354
BE BETTER USED. PART TIME

HAPPENED- WITH THIS PANDEMIC

02:46:59.709 --> 02:47:01.478
THAT'S GOING TO BE REALLY

02:47:01.544 --> 02:47:05.215
INTERESTING. TO WATCH IS THE-

02:47:05.281 --> 02:47:06.549

02:47:48.191 --> 02:47:49.793

03:28:58.092 --> 03:29:00.060
FASCINATING TO ME COMING FROM A

03:29:00.127 --> 03:29:01.395
CENTRAL VALLEY A LOWER INCOME

03:29:01.462 --> 03:29:03.764
COMMUNITY- JUST LAST YEAR WE

03:29:03.831 --> 03:29:05.032
FOUGHT VERY VERY HARD TO PUT IT

03:29:05.099 --> 03:29:06.600
SERVICES COVERED BACK UP MEDI

03:29:06.667 --> 03:29:09.370
CAL. AND NOW ON YOUR LATER IT'S

03:29:09.436 --> 03:29:11.872
ON THE CHOPPING BLOCK AND SO I

03:29:11.939 --> 03:29:12.706
THINK FOR ME IN NOT

03:29:12.773 --> 03:29:14.408
UNDERSTANDING THIS SIGNIFICANT

03:29:14.475 --> 03:29:19.113
OF JUST THAT ONE ASPECT OF THE

03:29:19.179 --> 03:29:21.081
MEDICAL SYSTEM IMPOSSIBLE

03:29:21.148 --> 03:29:21.649
SYSTEM IN ITS ENTIRETY BUT I

03:29:21.715 --> 03:29:23.918

WERE. SO HAVING THAT STRIPPED

03:29:32.726 --> 03:29:34.361
OUT OF MEDI CAL- I THINK IS

03:29:34.428 --> 03:29:36.397
DEVASTATING SIMPLY ONE YEAR

03:29:36.463 --> 03:29:38.699
AFTER- IT WAS PUT IN AND IT WAS

03:29:38.766 --> 03:29:40.467
STRIPPED OUT INTO THE TWO

03:29:40.534 --> 03:29:41.001

EVEN IDENTIFY THOSE AND I THINK

03:30:52.673 --> 03:30:53.140
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT OUR

03:30:53.207 --> 03:30:54.875

BE WITH EVERY UNIT IN MIND

03:31:30.544 --> 03:31:31.979
WRITING A BUDGET IS A SERIOUS

03:31:32.046 --> 03:31:33.814
CHALLENGE. BUT A SOUL IS

03:31:33.881 --> 03:31:34.615
IMPORTANT THE IMPACT ON

03:31:34.681 --> 03:31:36.550
RESIDENTS ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO

ARE IN LOW AND WORKING CLASS

03:31:38.585 --> 03:31:40.487
NEIGHBORHOODS. ARSON SOCIAL

03:31:40.554 --> 03:31:42.289
SAFETY NET MUST BE PROTECTED

03:31:42.356 --> 03:31:43.857
AND PROGRAMS TO MOVE THE

03:31:43.924 --> 03:31:46.193

HOMELESSNESS CRISIS HAS BEEN

03:31:47.428 --> 03:31:49.596
MADE MORE CHALLENGING SOLUTIONS

03:31:49.663 --> 03:31:50.731
LIKE EXPANDING THE TYPES OF

03:31:50.798 --> 03:31:53.200
HOUSING CARES ACT FUNDING CAN

03:31:53.267 --> 03:31:54.902
BE APPLIED TO WILL BE ESSENTIAL.

03:31:54.968 --> 03:31:56.470
IN PARTICULAR I'M CONCERNED

03:31:56.537 --> 03:31:58.405
ABOUT THE IMPACT PUBLIC SAFETY.

03:31:58.472 --> 03:31:59.540
THE ADMINISTRATION IS

03:31:59.606 --> 03:32:01.608
CONSIDERING THE CLOSURE OF TO

03:32:01.675 --> 03:32:03.510
STATE PRISONS WHEN THIS YEAR.

03:32:03.577 --> 03:32:04.678
I'M PARTICULARLY CONCERNED

03:32:04.745 --> 03:32:05.746
ABOUT THE CALIFORNIA

03:32:05.813 --> 03:32:07.214
INSTITUTION FOR MEN THE STATE

03:32:07.281 --> 03:32:09.817
PRISON IN CHINO. THIS FACILITY

03:32:09.883 --> 03:32:11.852
HAS MAJOR INFRASTRUCTURE ISSUES

03:32:11.919 --> 03:32:13.520
ALONG WITH THE HIGHEST

03:32:13.587 --> 03:32:14.455
INFECTION RATES OF COVERT

03:32:14.521 --> 03:32:15.722
NINETEEN IN THE STATE. THE

03:32:15.789 --> 03:32:18.125
FACILITY IS A NIGHTMARE HOWEVER

03:32:18.192 --> 03:32:19.293
TO CLOSE TO PRISONS MEANS

03:32:19.359 --> 03:32:21.328
ADDING MORE INMATES TO CHINO

03:32:21.395 --> 03:32:22.863
THIS IS DANGEROUS WITHOUT

03:32:22.930 --> 03:32:23.297
NEEDED UPGRADES AND

03:32:23.363 --> 03:32:26.166
IMPROVEMENTS. MISTER CHAIR MY

03:32:26.233 --> 03:32:26.800

UPGRADE CURRENT FACILITIES SUCH

03:32:31.839 --> 03:32:33.707
AS GINO TO COUNT FOR HIGHER

03:32:33.774 --> 03:32:40.114
POPULATION. THANK YOU. I'M JUST

03:32:40.180 --> 03:32:41.448
A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE PUBLIC

03:32:41.515 --> 03:32:43.484
SAFETY PROGRAMS- THE GOVERNOR'S

03:32:43.550 --> 03:32:45.352
MAY PROVISION DOES PRIORITIZE

03:32:45.419 --> 03:32:48.222
PUBLIC SAFETY ABSOLUTELY- THAT

03:32:48.288 --> 03:32:50.257
THE SAVINGS THAT I YOU KNOW

03:32:50.324 --> 03:32:51.391
HAVING HAVING BEEN SOMEONE WHO

03:32:51.458 --> 03:32:52.926
WORKED ON PUBLIC SAFETY

03:32:52.993 --> 03:32:54.561
PROPOSALS MANY YEARS AGO DURING

03:32:54.628 --> 03:32:56.663
THE LAST RECESSION WHAT USUALLY

03:32:56.730 --> 03:32:58.132
WITH THE DYNAMICIS REALLY A

03:32:58.198 --> 03:32:59.633
SPLASHING OF THE REHABILITATION

03:32:59.700 --> 03:33:01.869
PROGRAMS IN ORDER TO PRESERVE

03:33:01.935 --> 03:33:03.904
THE OTHER YOU KNOW MAINTAIN THE

03:33:03.971 --> 03:33:06.406
REST OF THE PERSON OPERATIONS

03:33:06.473 --> 03:33:08.275
AND IN THIS CASE THAT'S NOT

03:33:08.342 --> 03:33:09.877
WHAT THE PROPOSAL IS BECAUSE I

03:33:09.943 --> 03:33:10.811
THINK THERE'S A REAL

03:33:10.878 --> 03:33:13.981
RECOGNITION BY THIS BODY- AT AS

03:33:14.047 --> 03:33:15.782
WELL AS THE AS THE GOVERNOR IN

03:33:15.849 --> 03:33:16.650
THE ADMINISTRATION ABOUT THE

03:33:16.717 --> 03:33:18.919
IMPORTANCE OF THE AT. THE TIME

03:33:18.986 --> 03:33:20.320
THAT WE DO HAVE INMATES IN OUR

03:33:20.387 --> 03:33:21.321
PRESS IS THAT THEY ARE WORKING

03:33:21.388 --> 03:33:24.358
TOWARDS REHABILITATION AND THEN

03:33:24.424 --> 03:33:26.360
WILL BE RELEASED TO COMMUNITIES

03:33:26.426 --> 03:33:27.628
AND THAT'S GOING TO MAKE

03:33:27.694 --> 03:33:28.795
COMMUNITY SAFE WHEN THEY WHEN

03:33:28.862 --> 03:33:31.131
THEY LEAVE HAVE LEADS US

03:33:31.198 --> 03:33:36.203
PROGRAM. ONE PER. IN OUR IN OUR

03:33:36.270 --> 03:33:37.271
BUDGET TO I. WERE COST IN THE

03:33:37.337 --> 03:33:38.906
PER SYSTEM AND AT THAT I WANTED

03:33:38.972 --> 03:33:40.140
TO HIGHLIGHT WITH WAS ON THE

03:33:40.207 --> 03:33:41.208
PAROLE TERMS THIS IS AN

03:33:41.275 --> 03:33:44.211
EVIDENCE BASED- PROPOSAL- TO

FOR A LOT OF INMATES AT. AT TWO

03:33:48.348 --> 03:33:51.618
YEARS- AND THE IDEA THERE IS

03:33:51.685 --> 03:33:54.288
THAT MOST INMATES AND WHAT MOST

03:33:54.354 --> 03:33:56.423
OFFENDERS WHO. PRESIDENT BE AN

FEW MONTHS AND THAT'S REALLY

03:33:59.293 --> 03:34:01.261
BEEN BORNE OUT BY RESEARCH. AND

03:34:01.328 --> 03:34:03.030
SO THAT'S ONE OF THE WAYS THAT

03:34:03.096 --> 03:34:05.299

HAVE ON OUR NOVEMBER ELECTIONS.

ELECTIONS PROCEDURES TO UPHOLD

03:35:54.174 --> 03:35:55.275
THE FOUNDATIONAL PRINCIPLE THAT

03:35:55.342 --> 03:35:57.110
NO CALIFORNIA SHOULD HAVE TO

03:35:57.177 --> 03:35:58.612
RISK IN THEIR HEALTH AND

EXERCISE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL

03:36:01.682 --> 03:36:04.217
RIGHT TO VOTE. WE MUST AVOID

03:36:04.284 --> 03:36:05.652
THE BOTTLE THAT WE SAW ON

03:36:05.719 --> 03:36:06.920
WISCONSIN WHERE VOTERS WERE

03:36:06.987 --> 03:36:08.422
DISENFRANCHISED WHEN THEY WERE

03:36:08.488 --> 03:36:09.589
FORCED TO CHOOSE BETWEEN THE

03:36:09.656 --> 03:36:12.492
SAFETY OF THEIR HOMES. AND THE

03:36:12.559 --> 03:36:14.561
UNKNOWN RISKS VOTING IN PERSON.

03:36:14.628 --> 03:36:17.597
IN EARLY APRIL I'M AT AB EIGHT

03:36:17.664 --> 03:36:18.165
SIXTY TO REQUIRE THAT EVERY

03:36:18.231 --> 03:36:19.833
CALIFORNIA VOTER. RECEIVE A

OF THEIR OWN HOME. IN EARLY MAY

03:36:25.839 --> 03:36:27.341
THE GOVERNOR FOLLOWED THIS WITH

03:36:27.407 --> 03:36:27.941
AN EXECUTIVE ORDER TO REQUIRE

03:36:28.008 --> 03:36:30.744
THE SAME. BOTH MY BILL AND THE

03:36:30.811 --> 03:36:32.145
GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE ORDER

03:36:32.212 --> 03:36:33.246
ACKNOWLEDGE THE NEED TO

03:36:33.313 --> 03:36:35.048
MAINTAIN IN PERSON VOTING

03:36:35.115 --> 03:36:37.017
OPTIONS FOR THOSE WHO NEED. FOR

03:36:37.084 --> 03:36:38.185
MILLIONS OF VOTERS ACROSS

03:36:38.251 --> 03:36:39.753
CALIFORNIA THIS WILL BE A

03:36:39.820 --> 03:36:41.922
SIGNIFICANT SHIFT TO THE WAY

03:36:41.988 --> 03:36:42.456
THEY HAVE VOTED FOR THEIR

03:36:42.522 --> 03:36:44.224
ENTIRE LIFE. IT HAS THE

03:36:44.291 --> 03:36:45.759
POTENTIAL TO CREATE VOTER

03:36:45.826 --> 03:36:48.095
CONFUSION. IF THIS CONFUSION

03:36:48.161 --> 03:36:49.763
LEADS TO CALIFORNIANS NOT

03:36:49.830 --> 03:36:51.832
VOTING OUT OF FRUSTRATION THEN

03:36:51.898 --> 03:36:52.232
ALL WE'VE DONE IS

03:36:52.299 --> 03:36:54.101
UNINTENTIONALLY DISENFRANCHISE

03:36:54.167 --> 03:36:56.436
A DIFFERENT GROUP OF VOTERS.

03:36:56.503 --> 03:36:58.171
THAT IS WHY A STATEWIDE VOTER

03:36:58.238 --> 03:36:59.373
EDUCATION AND INFORMATION

03:36:59.439 --> 03:37:01.742
CAMPAIGN IS CRITICAL TO

03:37:01.808 --> 03:37:02.943
ENSURING THAT EVERY VOTER IN

03:37:03.009 --> 03:37:04.544
CALIFORNIA UNDERSTANDS THE

03:37:04.611 --> 03:37:06.046
CHANGES THAT HAVE BEEN PUT IN

03:37:06.113 --> 03:37:07.347

03:37:10.083 --> 03:37:11.752

RADIO AND STREAMING AUDIO AND

03:37:15.956 --> 03:37:17.524
IT'S CRITICAL THAT THE CAMPAIGN

03:37:17.591 --> 03:37:18.792
IS CONDUCTED WITH APPROPRIATE

03:37:18.859 --> 03:37:21.027

AS TO HOW MUCH THAT BUDGET

03:37:31.872 --> 03:37:33.407

03:39:30.557 --> 03:39:32.592
STATE ADDRESS ON THIS ISSUE

BECAUSE IT'S VERY IMPORTANT-

03:39:35.462 --> 03:39:38.398
AND IT'S AN A AND A CRISIS IN

03:39:38.465 --> 03:39:42.435
OUR STATE- AND IT STILL IS. AND

03:39:42.502 --> 03:39:44.538
MAYBE EVEN MORE NOW WITH THE

03:39:44.604 --> 03:39:47.641
COVERT NINETEEN SITUATION. I'VE

03:39:47.707 --> 03:39:49.209

03:39:49.276 --> 03:39:51.711
THE LAST TWO YEARS I'VE MET

03:39:51.778 --> 03:39:53.547
WITH DOZENS OF STAKEHOLDERS

03:39:53.613 --> 03:39:55.715

ALL UP ECHO THE SAME SENTIMENT.

03:39:58.818 --> 03:40:00.820
WE MUST CREATE ONE CENTRALIZED

OFFICE AT THE STATE LEVEL TO

03:40:03.123 --> 03:40:04.891

03:40:09.763 --> 03:40:11.031
IN THE FIGHT AGAINST

03:40:11.097 --> 03:40:13.033
HOMELESSNESS. FUNDING ALONE

03:40:13.099 --> 03:40:17.871

I LOOK FORWARD TO OF DISCUSSING

03:40:20.674 --> 03:40:22.709

EQUITABLE FUNDING TO ASSURE

03:41:42.355 --> 03:41:44.658
THAT THE STUDENTS ARE NOT LEFT

03:41:44.724 --> 03:41:47.894

04:05:21.807 --> 04:05:23.842
WERE ALREADY UNDER FUNDED. AND

04:05:23.909 --> 04:05:25.944
IN MY DISTRICT SCHOOLS WERE

04:05:26.011 --> 04:05:28.413
ALREADY CLOSING TO SAVE MONEY.

04:05:28.480 --> 04:05:29.448
THE GOVERNOR'S MAY REVISE

04:05:29.514 --> 04:05:32.084
PROPOSES A 10% CUT AND LOCAL

04:05:32.150 --> 04:05:35.287
CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA. THIS

04:05:35.353 --> 04:05:37.089
WOULD BE DETRIMENTAL TO OUR

04:05:37.155 --> 04:05:39.224
SCHOOL STUDENTS AND TEACHERS.

04:05:39.291 --> 04:05:41.193
ESPECIALLY AT A TIME WHEN WE

04:05:41.259 --> 04:05:41.693
ARE WORKING TO CLOSE THE

04:05:41.760 --> 04:05:43.929
ACHIEVEMENT GAP. THE CALIFORNIA

04:05:43.995 --> 04:05:45.530
LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS HAS

04:05:45.597 --> 04:05:49.501
PUSHED FOR REFORM TO THE LCL F.

04:05:49.568 --> 04:05:50.735
THAT EXPANDS FUNDING FOR MORE

04:05:50.802 --> 04:05:52.437
STUDENTS SPECIFICALLY THE

04:05:52.504 --> 04:05:55.574
LOWEST PERFORMING SUBGROUP. WE

04:05:55.640 --> 04:05:58.243
BELIEVE THIS WOULD FUND THE

04:05:58.310 --> 04:06:00.479
LITERAL GAP IN L. CFL AND GO A

04:06:00.545 --> 04:06:02.347
LONG WAY IN ADDRESSING

04:06:02.414 --> 04:06:05.684
DISPARITIES IN EDUCATION FOR

04:06:05.750 --> 04:06:07.619
AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDENTS. BUT

04:06:07.686 --> 04:06:10.322
INSTEAD OF MOVING FORWARD WE'RE

04:06:10.388 --> 04:06:12.257
NOW STEPPING BACKWARDS. WITH

04:06:12.324 --> 04:06:17.562
BIG CUTS. A 10% CUT TO L. CFF

04:06:17.629 --> 04:06:19.231
EQUATES TO THE FRONT FOLLOWING

04:06:19.297 --> 04:06:23.668
CUTS. THIS WOULD LOOK LIKE A

04:06:23.735 --> 04:06:24.302
ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED THIRTY

04:06:24.369 --> 04:06:25.637
DOLLAR DECREASED PER STUDENT

04:06:25.704 --> 04:06:30.208
SPENDING. EIGHT TWENTY ONE

04:06:30.275 --> 04:06:32.577
THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED AND SEVEN

04:06:32.644 --> 04:06:33.845
SIXTY SEVEN DOLLAR FUNDING CUT.

04:06:33.912 --> 04:06:37.716
PASSWORD IN A NINETEEN POINT 1%

04:06:37.782 --> 04:06:41.353
INCREASE IN CLASS SIZE. I

04:06:41.419 --> 04:06:42.654
UNDERSTAND THE DIFFICULT

04:06:42.721 --> 04:06:44.422
DECISIONS MUST BE MADE WITH

04:06:44.489 --> 04:06:46.057
THESE PROPOSED CUTS WOULD STRIP

04:06:46.124 --> 04:06:48.894
DISTRICTS OF THE RESOURCES

04:06:48.960 --> 04:06:51.062

PROGRAM. IT GIVES SCHOOLS THE

04:07:04.943 --> 04:07:06.478
ABILITY TO CREATE NEW

04:07:06.545 --> 04:07:08.446
OPPORTUNITIES FOR VULNERABLE

04:07:08.513 --> 04:07:11.049

SHORT TERM. WE SHOULD AT THE

04:18:31.229 --> 04:18:32.129

ADMINISTRATION- WITH REGARD TO

04:25:51.268 --> 04:25:53.237
THIS BUDGET- WE ALL KNOW HOW

04:25:53.304 --> 04:25:55.072
INCREDIBLY CHALLENGING THIS IS

04:25:55.139 --> 04:25:56.507
AS THE CHAIR OF THE HOUSING

04:25:56.573 --> 04:25:58.142
COMMITTEE MY COMMENTS WILL BE

04:25:58.208 --> 04:25:59.877
MOSTLY FOCUSED ON HOUSING.

04:25:59.943 --> 04:26:01.512
DURING OUR STATE'S HOUSING AND

04:26:01.578 --> 04:26:02.846
HOMELESSNESS CRISIS THE WORDS

04:26:02.913 --> 04:26:04.248
IN OUR STATE'S HISTORY AND THAT

04:26:04.315 --> 04:26:06.150
WAS BEFORE THE PANDEMIC. I

04:26:06.216 --> 04:26:07.017
APPRECIATE THAT THE GOVERNOR

04:26:07.084 --> 04:26:08.686
WAS ABLE TO AVOID MAJOR CUTS IN

04:26:08.752 --> 04:26:11.055
THIS AREA- FROM HIS ORIGINALLY

04:26:11.121 --> 04:26:13.524
PROPOSED BUDGET. BUT ON HOUSE

04:26:13.590 --> 04:26:14.291
CALIFORNIANS NEED MORE

04:26:14.358 --> 04:26:16.960
RESOURCES. CORONAVIRUS ON TOP

04:26:17.027 --> 04:26:19.530
OF THESE CRISES IS GASOLINE ON

04:26:19.596 --> 04:26:21.665
FIRE BECAUSE HOUSING AS HEALTH

04:26:21.732 --> 04:26:23.467
CARE AND THE LACK OF HOUSING

04:26:23.534 --> 04:26:24.635
WILL INCREASE COVER NINETEEN

04:26:24.702 --> 04:26:26.603
SPREAD. WE NEED MORE FUNDING TO

04:26:26.670 --> 04:26:28.372
PERSONALLY HOUSE CALIFORNIANS

04:26:28.439 --> 04:26:29.973
OVER A HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND

04:26:30.040 --> 04:26:31.275
HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS TO

04:26:31.342 --> 04:26:32.109
STABILIZE RENTERS AND

04:26:32.176 --> 04:26:34.978
HOMEOWNERS. WHO ARE A WRENCH OR

04:26:35.045 --> 04:26:36.714
A MORTGAGE CHECK AWAY FROM

04:26:36.780 --> 04:26:38.682
ADDICTIONS OR FORECLOSURES. AND

04:26:38.749 --> 04:26:39.717
I WOULD LIKE TO SUGGEST I HOPE

04:26:39.783 --> 04:26:41.151
THAT WE CAN CONSIDER ONGOING

04:26:41.218 --> 04:26:43.120
REVENUE MEASURES TO ADDRESS THE

04:26:43.187 --> 04:26:44.922
SITUATION. IN BUDGET

04:26:44.988 --> 04:26:46.390
SUBCOMMITTEE FOUR I ASKED A

04:26:46.457 --> 04:26:47.324
NUMBER OF QUESTIONS TO THE

04:26:47.391 --> 04:26:49.159
ADMINISTRATION TO UNDERSTAND

04:26:49.226 --> 04:26:50.227
SOME SPECIFICALLY PROPOSED

04:26:50.294 --> 04:26:51.895
POLICIES AND WOULD STILL

04:26:51.962 --> 04:26:54.031
APPRECIATE ANSWERS TO THEM.

04:26:54.098 --> 04:26:55.899
FIRST PROJECT ROOM KEY TO

PURCHASE HOTELS AND MOTELS FOR

04:26:57.801 --> 04:26:59.536
HOMELESS CALIFORNIANS IS A GOOD

04:26:59.603 --> 04:27:00.971
CONCEPT. BUT THERE ARE MANY

04:27:01.038 --> 04:27:02.206
UNANSWERED QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW

04:27:02.272 --> 04:27:04.007
IT WILL BE EFFECTIVE. BOTH

04:27:04.074 --> 04:27:05.409
BECAUSE IT'S SO EXPENSIVE PER

04:27:05.476 --> 04:27:06.977
UNIT AND ALSO BECAUSE IT

04:27:07.044 --> 04:27:07.878
DOESN'T FUND THE SERVICES

04:27:07.945 --> 04:27:09.880
NEEDED FOR EFFECTIVE PERMITS

04:27:09.947 --> 04:27:11.682
SUPPORT OF HOUSING. MY QUESTION

04:27:11.749 --> 04:27:12.916
IS WHETHER WE CAN MAKE THE

04:27:12.983 --> 04:27:14.852
PROGRAM MORE FLEXIBLE TO ALSO

04:27:14.918 --> 04:27:16.453
CONSIDER RENTAL ASSISTANCE TO

04:27:16.520 --> 04:27:18.088
MASTER LEASES FROM PRIVATE

04:27:18.155 --> 04:27:20.023
LANDLORDS. PAYING FOR RENT AS A

04:27:20.090 --> 04:27:21.125
LUMP SUM BEFORE THE END OF THE

04:27:21.191 --> 04:27:23.327
YEAR WITH OPERATING ASSISTANCE

04:27:23.394 --> 04:27:24.962
FOR SUPPORT OF HOUSING. COULD

04:27:25.028 --> 04:27:26.697
BE CONSIDER SPENDING ON REAL

04:27:26.764 --> 04:27:27.898
PRESERVATION OF AFFORDABLE

04:27:27.965 --> 04:27:30.868
HOUSING WHICH WOULD BE A TWENTY

04:27:30.934 --> 04:27:31.502
THOUSAND DOLLAR INVESTMENT PER

04:27:31.568 --> 04:27:34.204
UNIT VERSES THE ESTIMATED TWO

04:27:34.271 --> 04:27:35.172
HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLAR COST.

04:27:35.239 --> 04:27:37.007

MUCH NEEDED TO OUR CHAMPION FOR

04:27:44.982 --> 04:27:47.117
YEARS. THAT BEING SAID THE

04:27:47.184 --> 04:27:48.552
PROPOSED CAP ON INVESTORS USING

04:27:48.619 --> 04:27:50.654
TAX CREDITS WOULD UNDERMINE

04:27:50.721 --> 04:27:52.723
AFFORDABLE HOUSING INVESTMENTS.

04:27:52.790 --> 04:27:53.824
THE PROPOSAL ITSELF IS ALREADY

04:27:53.891 --> 04:27:55.325
DECREASING INVESTOR INTEREST IN

04:27:55.392 --> 04:27:57.027

TO ASK FOR CONSIDERATION OF

04:28:01.198 --> 04:28:01.732

FAMILIES AND WORKERS WHO

04:28:32.996 --> 04:28:34.898
BECAUSE OF THEIR STATUS CAN'T

04:28:34.965 --> 04:28:36.533

WE'LL GET SOME ANSWERS TO THOSE

04:28:50.214 --> 04:28:51.348
QUESTIONS- NOT NECESSARILY

04:28:51.415 --> 04:28:53.283
TODAY I WOULD IMAGINE BUT- IN

04:28:53.350 --> 04:28:54.585
THE NEAR FUTURE WITH THAT TO

04:28:54.651 --> 04:28:56.086
LOOK FOR TO WORK WITH EVERYONE.

04:28:56.153 --> 04:28:57.888
TO WHAT MOVING FORWARD THESE

04:28:57.955 --> 04:29:01.525
DIFFICULT DECISIONS. I'M IN A

04:29:01.592 --> 04:29:03.093
DRESS A COUPLE OF THEM ONE OF

04:29:03.160 --> 04:29:05.496
THEM THAT HAVE BEEN- AFTER A

04:29:05.562 --> 04:29:06.530
COUPLE TIMES AND THAT'S ABOUT

04:29:06.597 --> 04:29:09.766
THE MSF P. PROGRAM. AND THE SEA

04:29:09.833 --> 04:29:11.969
BASS PROGRAM- BOTH PROGRAMS

04:29:12.035 --> 04:29:14.037
THAT ARE ARE VERY GOOD PROGRAMS

04:29:14.104 --> 04:29:16.373
THEY ARE NOT ACTUALLY-

04:29:16.440 --> 04:29:17.241
IMPLEMENTED ACROSS THE STATE

04:29:17.307 --> 04:29:19.309
EVENLY. AND WE ARE LOOKING

04:29:19.376 --> 04:29:20.777
BECAUSE OF HOW VULNERABLE AND

04:29:20.844 --> 04:29:22.212
FREE OF THIS POPULATION IS AND

04:29:22.279 --> 04:29:24.848
HOW- IMPACTED BY THE COVERT

04:29:24.915 --> 04:29:26.750
NINETEEN PANDEMIC THEY ARE. AND

04:29:26.817 --> 04:29:28.085
WE ARE LOOKING AT THIS NEW

04:29:28.151 --> 04:29:29.486
BENEFIT THAT WOULD BE A PART OF

04:29:29.553 --> 04:29:31.355
THE MAIN MEDI CAL PROGRAM SO

04:29:31.421 --> 04:29:32.523
WOULD BE STATEWIDE IN WOULD BE

04:29:32.589 --> 04:29:35.092
CONSISTENT STATEWIDE- THAT

04:29:35.158 --> 04:29:40.230
WOULD BE PROVIDE. THE NURSING

04:29:40.297 --> 04:29:42.299
NURSING HOME AT AND NURSING

04:29:42.366 --> 04:29:43.467
CERTAIN NURSING HOME SERVICES

04:29:43.534 --> 04:29:45.369
AT HOME. AND THE IDEA WOULD BE

04:29:45.435 --> 04:29:46.470
TO WRAP AROUND THESE FRAIL

04:29:46.537 --> 04:29:47.804
SENIORS WITH THE TYPES OF

04:29:47.871 --> 04:29:49.239
SERVICES THAT THEY NEED TO

04:29:49.306 --> 04:29:51.375
PROVIDE IN A SAFE ENVIRONMENT-

04:29:51.441 --> 04:29:54.311
AT HOME- TO BE HONEST LIKE THE

04:29:54.378 --> 04:29:55.946
COVERT BAND HAMMOCK HAS REALLY

04:29:56.013 --> 04:29:57.648
IMPACTED SIGNIFICANTLY THE

04:29:57.714 --> 04:29:59.049
OPERATION OF MANY OF THESE

04:29:59.116 --> 04:30:01.318
CENTERS BECAUSE- SENIORS CAN'T

04:30:01.385 --> 04:30:03.720
SAFELY CONGREGATE- IN. AND

04:30:03.787 --> 04:30:05.756
COMMON SPACES SO THAT SOMETHING

04:30:05.822 --> 04:30:08.191
THAT WE CONTINUE TO WORK I'M AT

04:30:08.258 --> 04:30:09.126
DAY IN AND DAY NIGHT TO GET

04:30:09.192 --> 04:30:11.828
THOSE- WRAPAROUND SERVICES TO

04:30:11.895 --> 04:30:13.931
THOSE SENIORS- ADDITIONAL MEALS

04:30:13.997 --> 04:30:15.632
TO THE SENIORS. AND THERE ARE

04:30:15.699 --> 04:30:17.301
ADDITIONAL FEDERAL FUNDS THAT

04:30:17.367 --> 04:30:19.570
ARE COMING IN JULY ONE- I

04:30:19.636 --> 04:30:20.837
BELIEVE THAT THE SENIOR

04:30:20.904 --> 04:30:22.306
NUTRITION PROGRAM- IT THAT'S

04:30:22.372 --> 04:30:24.474
BEEN REFERENCED A FEW TIMES WAS

04:30:24.541 --> 04:30:26.510
A ONE TIME REQUESTED THAT FROM

04:30:26.577 --> 04:30:28.812
LAST YEAR THAT HADN'T GONE OUT

04:30:28.879 --> 04:30:29.613
YET AND I THINK THAT'S- ONE OF

04:30:29.680 --> 04:30:31.081
THE THINGS THAT- KEEPS BEING

04:30:31.148 --> 04:30:32.916
RIGHT UP IT'S NOT A BASE CUTS

04:30:32.983 --> 04:30:34.084
YOU SEEN YOUR NUTRITION

04:30:34.151 --> 04:30:36.053
PROGRAMS THAT. ABSOLUTELY WOULD

04:30:36.119 --> 04:30:37.588
NOT BE IN LINE WITH WHAT WE'RE

04:30:37.654 --> 04:30:39.022
TRYING TO DO IN THIS BUDGET.

04:30:39.089 --> 04:30:40.490
AND THERE IS ADDITIONAL FEDERAL

04:30:40.557 --> 04:30:41.992
FINES THERE'S A LOT THAT'S

04:30:42.059 --> 04:30:44.027
GOING ON IN THE COPA NINETEEN

04:30:44.094 --> 04:30:45.095
RESPONSE TO GET ADDITIONAL

04:30:45.162 --> 04:30:47.397
MEALS TO SENIORS. AND ALSO HELP

04:30:47.464 --> 04:30:48.665
TO SUPPORT THAT THE RICH THE

04:30:48.732 --> 04:30:49.933
RESTAURANT INDUSTRY THAT'S BEEN

04:30:50.000 --> 04:30:52.903
VERY- HARD HIT BY THE PANDEMIC.

04:30:52.970 --> 04:30:54.438
I'M SO SENIORS ARE A HIGH

04:30:54.504 --> 04:30:56.206
PRIORITY- I DEFINITELY

04:30:56.273 --> 04:30:58.141
RECOGNIZE THAT A LOT OF CONCERN

04:30:58.208 --> 04:30:59.376
ABOUT THOSE TWO OPTIONAL

04:30:59.443 --> 04:31:00.877
BENEFITS. AND IT'S REALLY

04:31:00.944 --> 04:31:02.813
IMPORTANT WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT

04:31:02.879 --> 04:31:04.281
THE CHOICES THERE ARE REALLY

04:31:04.348 --> 04:31:06.116
HARD CHOICES WHEN YOU LOOK AT

04:31:06.183 --> 04:31:07.551
REDUCING THE GENERAL FUND AT

04:31:07.618 --> 04:31:10.220
THE LEVEL. THAT WE HAVE TO

04:31:10.287 --> 04:31:11.722
BALANCE THE BUDGET ABSENCE

04:31:11.788 --> 04:31:14.124
BETTER ABSENT FEDERAL FUNDS-

04:31:14.191 --> 04:31:15.692
THERE ARE REALLY JUST THREE

04:31:15.759 --> 04:31:18.128
SCHOOLS IN THE HEALTHCARE AREA

04:31:18.195 --> 04:31:19.429
THERE'S ELIGIBILITY THEIR

04:31:19.496 --> 04:31:20.964
OPTIONAL BENEFITS AND THEIR

04:31:21.031 --> 04:31:23.500
RATES. AND THE PROPOSITION

04:31:23.567 --> 04:31:24.434
FIFTY SIX ARE SUPPLEMENTAL

04:31:24.501 --> 04:31:26.069
RATES THAT WE'VE BEEN PROVIDING

04:31:26.136 --> 04:31:27.337
JUST FOR THE LAST COUPLE OF

04:31:27.404 --> 04:31:30.774
YEARS. PRIOR AT TO ABOUT THREE

04:31:30.841 --> 04:31:33.043
YEARS AGO THOSE THOSE MONIES

04:31:33.110 --> 04:31:34.344
WERE BEING FUND FOR FINDING CAL

04:31:34.411 --> 04:31:37.047
BASED. AND THEN WE WERE ABLE TO

04:31:37.114 --> 04:31:38.615
THROUGH THE BETTER ECONOMIC

04:31:38.682 --> 04:31:43.153
TIMES. TO SWITCH THOSE MONEY

04:31:43.220 --> 04:31:44.588
INTO SUPPLEMENTAL RAY. AND I'M

04:31:44.655 --> 04:31:45.656
NOT TO SIT HERE AND- THAT THE

04:31:45.722 --> 04:31:47.858
CARE AND THREE AND A BE FINE

04:31:47.924 --> 04:31:48.759
THROUGH THIS THERE IS ALL. OF

04:31:48.825 --> 04:31:51.261
AND- I THE ENTIRE CARE AND THE

04:31:51.328 --> 04:31:53.063
IMPACTS THAT THE KOBE PANDEMIC

04:31:53.130 --> 04:31:55.165
HAS HAD ON IT AND MAY CONTINUE

RECESSION FACING A FIFTY FOUR

04:40:53.970 --> 04:40:54.904
BILLION DOLLAR BUDGET DEFICIT

WRENCHING CUTS AND SO I JUST

NOT SPECIFICS THE THEY CAN BE

04:41:04.981 --> 04:41:05.848
APPLIED TO A NUMBER SPECIFICS

04:41:05.915 --> 04:41:07.817
BUT TWO THEMES ONE THAT WE- DO

04:41:07.884 --> 04:41:09.485
A LOT OF US. HAVE ALREADY ASKED

04:41:09.552 --> 04:41:10.753
THAT WE DO WHICH IS KEEP OUR

04:41:10.820 --> 04:41:12.589
MOST VULNERABLE IN MIND. AND

04:41:12.655 --> 04:41:13.923
TOP OF MIND AS WE MAKE OUR

04:41:13.990 --> 04:41:15.458
DECISIONS AND TO. THAT WE

04:41:15.525 --> 04:41:18.861
PRIORITIZE. REVENUE OPTIONS

04:41:18.928 --> 04:41:20.763
MORE THAN WE HAVE SO FAR IN

04:41:20.830 --> 04:41:22.432
THIS DISCUSSION WE KNOW RIGHT

04:41:22.498 --> 04:41:24.767
NOW. THAT SO MANY PEOPLE ARE

04:41:24.834 --> 04:41:26.636
BARELY HANGING ON OTHERS. CAN

04:41:26.703 --> 04:41:29.072
NO LONGER HANG ON WE KNOW. THAT

04:41:29.138 --> 04:41:30.073
FOLKS ARE TEETERING ON THE EDGE

04:41:30.139 --> 04:41:31.407
AND SOME HAVE FALLEN OVER THE

04:41:31.474 --> 04:41:32.508
EDGE ALREADY WE KNOW THAT AN

04:41:32.575 --> 04:41:34.510
ECONOMIC. RECESSION HURTS FIRST

04:41:34.577 --> 04:41:35.912
AND HURTS WORSE THOSE MOST

04:41:35.979 --> 04:41:38.748
VULNERABLE. IN OUR COMMUNITY.

04:41:38.815 --> 04:41:42.051
SO FOLKS NEED US TO HELP THEM

04:41:42.118 --> 04:41:44.120
MORE NOT LESS. THEY NEED TO

04:41:44.187 --> 04:41:48.591
INVEST I'M NOT. THAT FROM THEM

04:41:48.658 --> 04:41:51.294
SO I REALLY ASK THAT WE CAN ARM

04:41:51.361 --> 04:41:53.196
VULNERABLE TALK SOME. ABOUT

04:41:53.263 --> 04:41:55.531

SAFE KEEPING US HEALTHY. IN

04:42:09.279 --> 04:42:09.846
MANY CASES KEEPING US. MANY OF

04:42:09.912 --> 04:42:12.615
THEM. STAND TO LOSE SO MUCH

04:42:12.682 --> 04:42:14.751
FROM THE CUTS IN PROPOSED CUTS

04:42:14.817 --> 04:42:16.119
IN THIS BUDGET AND I KNOW THOSE

04:42:16.185 --> 04:42:18.221
CUTS. AREN'T DESIRED WE TAKE NO

04:42:18.288 --> 04:42:20.490
PLEASURE IN THEM- THERE ON.

04:42:20.556 --> 04:42:22.258
CONSEQUENCES BUT I REALLY ASKED

04:42:22.325 --> 04:42:24.193
THAT WE KEEP THAT EQUITY LANDS.

04:42:24.260 --> 04:42:26.429
AS WE VIEW OUR BUDGET AND MAKE

04:42:26.496 --> 04:42:31.167
DECISIONS ABOUT- WHO GOING TO

04:42:31.234 --> 04:42:31.768
BENEFIT IN GOING TO GET HURT

04:42:31.834 --> 04:42:34.237
BECAUSE THAT THOSE THE THAT.

04:42:34.304 --> 04:42:35.972
HURT MOST THE AT LEAST PREPARED

04:42:36.039 --> 04:42:37.307
TO BEAR THAT BURDEN. SO LET'S

04:42:37.373 --> 04:42:38.975
KEEP THAT IN IN MIND I KNOW SO

04:42:39.042 --> 04:42:40.310

CUTS THAT ARE JUST INCREDIBLY

04:43:15.678 --> 04:43:17.680

THERE AS FAR AS TAKING ANOTHER

04:44:42.899 --> 04:44:44.534
LOOK AT SOME OF THE STATE'S TAX

04:44:44.600 --> 04:44:46.969
EXPENDITURES. AND IN SOME CASES

04:44:47.036 --> 04:44:48.871
WE THINK THAT SOME OF THE TAX

04:44:48.938 --> 04:44:50.606
EXPENDITURES THAT EXIST- HAVE A

04:44:50.673 --> 04:44:52.074
QUESTIONABLE POLICY

04:44:52.141 --> 04:44:54.677
JUSTIFICATION. ARE THAT YOU

04:44:54.744 --> 04:44:57.213
COULD CONSIDER- THIS STEP UP

04:44:57.280 --> 04:44:59.482
BASIS ON INHERITED ASSETS

04:44:59.549 --> 04:45:01.984
WHERE- PERSON INHERITS AN ASSET

04:45:02.051 --> 04:45:05.288
IN IT'S NOT- RE PRICES TO

04:45:05.354 --> 04:45:07.290
MARKET VALUE- YOU COULD

04:45:07.356 --> 04:45:10.159
CONSIDER- MOVING THE- STATE'S

04:45:10.226 --> 04:45:13.229
TAX CODE MORE. IN LINE. WITH

04:45:13.296 --> 04:45:15.064
WHAT THEY CALL- CONFORMITY TO

04:45:15.131 --> 04:45:17.834
THE FEDERAL TAX CODE. AND PUT A

04:45:17.900 --> 04:45:19.602
LIMIT ON THE PROPERTY TAX

04:45:19.669 --> 04:45:23.105
DEDUCTIONS THAT- PEOPLE BENEFIT

04:45:23.172 --> 04:45:25.741
FROM CURRENTLY WITH THEIR LOCAL

04:45:25.808 --> 04:45:27.210
PROPERTY TAX PAYMENTS. SO THERE

04:45:27.276 --> 04:45:29.078
ARE PROBABLY A RANGE OF OPTIONS

04:45:29.145 --> 04:45:30.246
AND I THINK OUR OFFICEWOULD BE

04:45:30.313 --> 04:45:32.114

AND WE ACTUALLY HAVE A POST ON

04:45:35.551 --> 04:45:36.953
OUR WEBSITE THAT TALKS THROUGH

04:45:37.019 --> 04:45:40.756
SOME OF THESE IDEAS SO. THERE

04:45:40.823 --> 04:45:41.991
ARE SOME IDEAS OUT THERE. THANK

NOT HAVE A VOICE IN OUR STATE

04:46:02.945 --> 04:46:05.047

SHELTERS ARE A LIFELINE FOR

04:47:18.521 --> 04:47:19.822
THOSE PEOPLE AND THEIR CHILDREN

04:47:19.889 --> 04:47:21.424
THEY'RE A LIFELINE WE NEED TO

04:47:21.490 --> 04:47:23.526
PROTECT OUR MOST VULNERABLE

FROM OUR GOVERNOR ABOUT THAT.

04:47:38.674 --> 04:47:40.309
NEXT WITH REGARD EDUCATION.

GENERAL FUND EXPENDITURES ARE

04:47:44.680 --> 04:47:46.482
BEING SLASHED BY FOURTEEN POINT

04:47:46.549 --> 04:47:48.618
THREE PERCENT. NON EDUCATION

04:47:48.684 --> 04:47:50.820
GENERAL FUND EXPENDITURES ARE

04:47:50.886 --> 04:47:52.588
ONLY BEING CUT BY FIVE PORT

FIFTY FOUR BILLION DOLLAR

04:48:00.162 --> 04:48:01.597
BUDGET PROBLEM THE BIGGEST CUT

04:48:01.664 --> 04:48:02.798
IS TO QUE THROUGH FOURTEEN

04:48:02.865 --> 04:48:05.668
EDUCATION BIGGEST PARTS 28% OF

04:48:05.735 --> 04:48:08.170
THE PROPOSED SOLUTIONS. THAT'S

04:48:08.237 --> 04:48:10.573
WRONG EDUCATION IS A CORE STATE

04:48:10.640 --> 04:48:11.774
GOVERNMENT FUNCTION IT'S THE

04:48:11.841 --> 04:48:13.442
TOP PRIORITY OF OUR STATE

04:48:13.509 --> 04:48:15.544
GOVERNMENT. THE TOP PRIORITY

04:48:15.611 --> 04:48:16.812
THE VOTERS AGREE THAT'S WHY THE

04:48:16.879 --> 04:48:18.948

A FOR BUT IS NOW BECOME THE

04:48:25.388 --> 04:48:28.024
CEILING BECAUSE THIS BUDGET. IF

04:48:28.090 --> 04:48:28.658
EDUCATION IS TRULY OUR TOP

04:48:28.724 --> 04:48:31.027
PRIORITY IT SHOULD BE THE FIRST

04:48:31.093 --> 04:48:32.361
THING WE FIND AND THE LAST

04:48:32.428 --> 04:48:34.830
THING WE CUT. PERIOD WE'VE SEEN

04:48:34.897 --> 04:48:35.865
LEARNING LOSS FROM REMOTE

04:48:35.931 --> 04:48:37.333
LEARNING ALREADY. WE ASKED OUR

04:48:37.400 --> 04:48:38.801
TEACHERS ARE EDUCATORS ARE

04:48:38.868 --> 04:48:41.237
ADMINISTRATORS TO DO DIFFICULT

04:48:41.303 --> 04:48:43.339
AND CREATIVE AN UNPRECEDENTED

04:48:43.406 --> 04:48:45.307
THINGS AND THEY RESPOND. TO

04:48:45.374 --> 04:48:46.242
KEEP SOME SEMBLANCE OF

04:48:46.308 --> 04:48:47.843
EDUCATION GOING DURING

04:48:47.910 --> 04:48:49.845
WARRANTY. NOW WE'RE GONNA ASK

04:48:49.912 --> 04:48:50.946
THEM TO DO EVEN MORE AS WE

04:48:51.013 --> 04:48:52.181
START SCHOOL NEXT YEAR AND

04:48:52.248 --> 04:48:53.916
THEY'RE GONNA HAVE TO DO WITH

04:48:53.983 --> 04:48:54.450
MUCH MUCH LESS. AND THAT'S

04:48:54.517 --> 04:48:57.086
WRONG. EDUCATION IS THE LADDER

04:48:57.153 --> 04:48:58.888
OF OPPORTUNITY FOR MILLIONS.

04:48:58.954 --> 04:49:01.290

PRIORITIZE AND FUNDED IN THIS

04:49:18.174 --> 04:49:21.010
BODY AND THIS BUDGET SLASHES IT

04:49:21.077 --> 04:49:23.546
IN HALF AND THAT'S WRONG. THAT

04:49:23.612 --> 04:49:25.548
IS THE LIFELINE FOR PEOPLE THAT

04:49:25.614 --> 04:49:27.049
IS THEIR PATHWAY TO A SKILLED

04:49:27.116 --> 04:49:28.851

04:49:38.060 --> 04:49:39.595
THAN A FOURTEEN PERCENT CUT

04:49:39.662 --> 04:49:41.397
BIGGER THAN ANYTHING ELSE. THEY

04:49:41.464 --> 04:49:43.065

05:13:15.743 --> 05:13:16.978
PAYCHECKS AWAY FROM FINANCIAL

05:13:17.044 --> 05:13:18.913
RUIN AND WE'VE NOW SEEN WHAT

05:13:18.980 --> 05:13:20.181
HAPPENS WHEN WE HAVE AN ENTIRE

05:13:20.248 --> 05:13:22.517
STATE. THAT LOSES ITS PAYCHECK

05:13:22.583 --> 05:13:23.618
FOR A COUPLE OF WEEKS AND I

05:13:23.684 --> 05:13:24.852
THINK THAT THAT SHOULD SHOW US

05:13:24.919 --> 05:13:26.187
THAT OUR ECONOMY IS NOT NEARLY

05:13:26.254 --> 05:13:28.022
AS RESILIENT. AS WE MAY HAVE

05:13:28.089 --> 05:13:29.390
THOUGHT WE'VE HAD FOR A LONG

05:13:29.457 --> 05:13:30.825
TIME AND ECONOMY IN CALIFORNIA

05:13:30.892 --> 05:13:32.960
THAT'S WORKED EXTREMELY WELL

05:13:33.027 --> 05:13:35.930
FOR A VERY FEW AMOUNT OF PEOPLE.

05:13:35.997 --> 05:13:37.165
AND WE TALK ABOUT REBUILDING

05:13:37.231 --> 05:13:38.633
AND RECOVERY I HOPE THAT A

05:13:38.699 --> 05:13:40.034
RECOVERY IS NOT AS WITH AN EYE

05:13:40.101 --> 05:13:43.037
TOWARDS GETTING BACK WHERE WE

05:13:43.104 --> 05:13:45.072
BECAUSE IT DOES HOW TO SOLVE

05:13:45.139 --> 05:13:46.274
THOSE ISSUES THAT LED TO SO

05:13:46.340 --> 05:13:48.676
MANY CALIFORNIANS BEING. JUST A

05:13:48.743 --> 05:13:50.545
COUPLE OF PAYCHECKS AWAY FROM

05:13:50.611 --> 05:13:51.546
LOSING THE ROOF OVER THEIR

05:13:51.612 --> 05:13:54.148
HEADS. NOW COLBERT NINETEEN IS

05:13:54.215 --> 05:13:54.782
HIDDEN CERTAIN POPULATIONS MORE

05:13:54.849 --> 05:13:57.585
THAN OTHERS. IT'S NO SURPRISE

05:13:57.652 --> 05:13:58.953
TO A LOT OF US THAT IT'S HIT.

05:13:59.020 --> 05:14:01.022
ARE SOCIO ECONOMICALLY

05:14:01.088 --> 05:14:02.323
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES ARE

05:14:02.390 --> 05:14:03.591
BLACK IN OUR BROWN COMMUNITIES

05:14:03.658 --> 05:14:04.926
MORE THAN IT'S HEARD A LOT OF

05:14:04.992 --> 05:14:06.594
OTHER COMMUNITIES. THERE'S A

05:14:06.661 --> 05:14:08.095
LOT OF REASONS TO GO INTO THAT

05:14:08.162 --> 05:14:09.564
I DON'T THINK IT'S GENETICS. I

05:14:09.630 --> 05:14:11.332
THINK IT HAS A LOT TO DO WITH

05:14:11.399 --> 05:14:13.067
SYSTEMIC IN LONG TERMS UNDER

05:14:13.134 --> 05:14:13.968
INVESTMENTS IN THOSE

05:14:14.035 --> 05:14:14.869
COMMUNITIES AND THOSE

05:14:14.936 --> 05:14:17.038
POPULATIONS. AND THE RESULTS

05:14:17.104 --> 05:14:18.706
THAT THAT'S HAD OF BEEN REALLY-

05:14:18.773 --> 05:14:20.408
TRAUMATIC AND WE'VE GOT A FIX

05:14:20.474 --> 05:14:21.409
THAT AND MAKE SURE THAT OUR

05:14:21.475 --> 05:14:23.177
BUDGET DOESN'T DO MORE HARM. TO

05:14:23.244 --> 05:14:24.879
THOSE VERY COMMUNITIES THAT

05:14:24.946 --> 05:14:26.080
MEANS THAT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE

05:14:26.147 --> 05:14:26.681
THAT WE PROTECT OUR

05:14:26.747 --> 05:14:29.817
INVESTMENTS. IN CHILD CARE. IN

05:14:29.884 --> 05:14:31.852
HEALTH OUTCOMES AND ARE HEALTH

05:14:31.919 --> 05:14:34.288
FACILITIES. IN OUR ELDERLY WHO

05:14:34.355 --> 05:14:35.489

THEY'RE PROTECTED IN OUR FOSTER

05:14:37.158 --> 05:14:37.925
YOUTH WHO WERE SO

05:14:37.992 --> 05:14:39.527
DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTED BY

05:14:39.594 --> 05:14:41.529
HOMELESSNESS. AND BY LATER ON

05:14:41.596 --> 05:14:44.465
A- GOING INTO PRISONS. IN

AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND

05:14:45.666 --> 05:14:47.068
HOMELESSNESS THAT IN LOS

05:14:47.134 --> 05:14:48.903
ANGELES ALREADY WORK REALLY THE

05:14:48.970 --> 05:14:50.338
SAME OF THE STATE AND IN MANY

05:14:50.404 --> 05:14:52.273
PARTS OF THE STATE. THIS IS

05:14:52.340 --> 05:14:52.673
GOING TO MAKE THAT

05:14:52.740 --> 05:14:55.776
EXPONENTIALLY WORSE. CERTAINLY

05:14:55.843 --> 05:14:56.911
IN EDUCATION WHICH SHOULD BE

05:14:56.978 --> 05:14:58.813
THE PRIDE OF OUR STATE. ON THE

05:14:58.879 --> 05:14:59.780
OTHER THING I WANT I WANT TO

05:14:59.847 --> 05:15:01.115
TALK ABOUT BEFORE I GET TO

SPECIFIC EXAMPLES. IS REALLY.

05:15:03.451 --> 05:15:06.187
RESILIENCY AT MAKING SURE THAT

05:15:06.254 --> 05:15:07.989
WHAT WE INVEST THAT WE DON'T.

05:15:08.055 --> 05:15:09.757
PULL INVESTMENTS FROM SOME THAT

05:15:09.824 --> 05:15:11.158
THEY MIGHT HELP BALANCE BUDGET.

05:15:11.225 --> 05:15:13.527
BUT THE ON THE ROAD ACOSTA EXT.

05:15:13.594 --> 05:15:16.964
MORE BECAUSE THEY WERE PROGRAMS

GENERATIONS EVEN MAYBE JUST

05:15:28.943 --> 05:15:30.177
FIVE YEARS DOWN THE ROAD WE'RE

05:15:30.244 --> 05:15:31.712
GOING TO COST US MUCH MUCH

05:15:31.779 --> 05:15:33.514
MORE. IN NOT JUST IN OUR BUDGET

05:15:33.581 --> 05:15:38.319

RECOGNIZE THE BOUNCING A

05:38:45.838 --> 05:38:47.140
BUDGET. DURING AN ECONOMIC

05:38:47.206 --> 05:38:48.808
CRISIS WILL NOT BE EASY NOR

AND LEAVES FUTURE LEGISLATORS

05:39:04.857 --> 05:39:06.059
WITH EVEN WORSE OPTIONS TO

05:39:06.125 --> 05:39:08.027

05:39:16.769 --> 05:39:18.438
ROBUST STATE STIMULUS PLAN.

05:39:18.504 --> 05:39:19.939

CALIFORNIANS BACK TO WORK WE

05:39:22.108 --> 05:39:24.077
MUST EXPLAIN HOW OUR ACTIONS.

05:39:24.143 --> 05:39:26.079
IN THE BUDGET AND OUTSIDE OF IT

05:39:26.145 --> 05:39:27.380
WILL HELP PUT THE STATE

05:39:27.447 --> 05:39:29.048

THAT WE NEED TO PROPERLY

05:39:33.853 --> 05:39:35.254
SERVICE ARE FORTY MILLION

05:39:35.321 --> 05:39:37.724

PROPER FUNDING OF PUBLIC

05:39:40.326 --> 05:39:42.361
EDUCATION. THIS IS NOT ONLY AN

05:39:42.428 --> 05:39:43.596
IMPERATIVE FOR PARENTS LOOKING

05:39:43.663 --> 05:39:44.931
TO RETURN TO WORK BUT IS

05:39:44.997 --> 05:39:46.566
CRITICAL FOR TRAINING OUR YOUNG

05:39:46.632 --> 05:39:47.967
PEOPLE TO COMPETE IN THE GLOBAL

05:39:48.034 --> 05:39:49.769
ECONOMY. THEY ARE OF COURSE OUR

05:39:49.836 --> 05:39:51.838
FUTURE TAXPAYERS. I SHARE THE

05:39:51.904 --> 05:39:52.972
CONCERNS OF OUR LARGE URBAN

05:39:53.039 --> 05:39:53.873
SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAVE

05:39:53.940 --> 05:39:54.774
QUESTIONED THE EDUCATIONAL

05:39:54.841 --> 05:39:55.908
FUNDING DECISIONS IN THIS

BUDGET AND HOPE THAT THEY WILL

05:39:57.477 --> 05:39:59.212
BE ADDRESSED. I THINK THAT'S

05:39:59.278 --> 05:40:00.213
ALSO TRUE FOR THE UTILIZATION

05:40:00.279 --> 05:40:02.348
OF POP SIXTY FIFTY SIX MONTHS

05:40:02.415 --> 05:40:03.850
PARTICULARLY AS THEY RELATE TO

05:40:03.916 --> 05:40:05.718
WOMEN'S HEALTH CARE. SECONDLY

05:40:05.785 --> 05:40:06.419
I'VE BEEN IMPRESSED BY THE

05:40:06.486 --> 05:40:07.954
NIMBLE ACTION OF STATE AGENCIES

05:40:08.020 --> 05:40:09.522

OF DOLLARS TO A HEALTHCARE

05:43:53.746 --> 05:43:55.014
SYSTEM THAT IS ALREADY AN

05:43:55.081 --> 05:43:56.449
ADEQUATE FOR MANY WHO THOSE.

05:43:56.515 --> 05:43:58.818
HORNS WERE IN GREAT NEED.

05:43:58.884 --> 05:43:59.852
THAT'S NOT TO MENTION THAT-

05:43:59.919 --> 05:44:01.821
DIGITAL DIVIDE. SO IF YOU'RE IN

TELEHEALTH IS WANTED POTENTIAL

05:44:16.335 --> 05:44:18.204
SOLUTION. PARTICULARLY FOR

05:44:18.270 --> 05:44:20.106
THOSE WHO CAN'T SHOW UP. I TO A

05:44:20.172 --> 05:44:22.141
CLINIC TO A OSPITAL OR TO

05:44:22.208 --> 05:44:26.245
VISIT A REGULAR DOCTOR. THERE

05:44:26.312 --> 05:44:27.680
ARE SOLUTIONS ON THE TABLE THAT

05:44:27.747 --> 05:44:30.282
WE CAN TAKE. NOBODY HERE I

05:44:30.349 --> 05:44:33.753
BELIEVE ONCE DID YOU ANY CUTS.

05:44:33.819 --> 05:44:35.021
BASED ON WHAT I'VE HEARD ALL OF

05:44:35.087 --> 05:44:36.422
US LAMENTED THE SITUATION THAT

05:44:36.489 --> 05:44:37.923
WE'RE IN WITH A FIFTY FOUR

05:44:37.990 --> 05:44:39.959
BILLION DOLLAR DEFICIT. AND

05:44:40.026 --> 05:44:40.893
EVEN IF IT'S BACK BILL BY

05:44:40.960 --> 05:44:43.329
FEDERAL FUNDS WE STILL LACK. A

05:44:43.396 --> 05:44:45.564
SOCIAL MATT. WE STILL LACK THE

05:44:45.631 --> 05:44:47.366
ABILITY TO FULFILL THOSE THINGS

05:44:47.433 --> 05:44:48.934
THAT WE VERY MUCH CARE ABOUT.

05:44:49.001 --> 05:44:51.070
EVERYONE HERE STATED. THAT WE

05:44:51.137 --> 05:44:52.371
NEEDED TO PRESERVE PROGRAMS

05:44:52.438 --> 05:44:54.240
THAT WE LAMENTED CUTS. BUT

05:44:54.306 --> 05:44:56.308
THAT'S ONLY IF WE ACCEPT THE

05:44:56.375 --> 05:44:56.842
STATUS QUO AND DON'T THINK

05:44:56.909 --> 05:45:00.679
ABOUT SOLUTIONS. AND THE WAY TO

05:45:00.746 --> 05:45:02.782
INCREASE REVENUE. I DON'T THINK

05:45:02.848 --> 05:45:04.450
IT'S A SECRET THAT PAST

05:45:04.517 --> 05:45:06.218
GOVERNORS AND LEGISLATURES. AND

05:45:06.285 --> 05:45:10.156
COALITIONS HAVE AFTER VOTERS TO

05:45:10.222 --> 05:45:13.459
CONSIDER RAISING REVENUE VOTERS

05:45:13.526 --> 05:45:15.361
CAN DECIDE FOR THEMSELVES

05:45:15.428 --> 05:45:16.262
WHETHER OR NOT THAT'S A THAT'S

05:45:16.328 --> 05:45:19.065
A FAIR SOLUTION. AND I DON'T I

05:45:19.131 --> 05:45:21.801
LOOK AT IT ONE OF THE 1% JUMP

05:45:21.867 --> 05:45:24.236
ON A PRIVATE JET GO TO THE

05:45:24.303 --> 05:45:25.738
LUXURY OF A TWENTY SECONDS THE

05:45:25.805 --> 05:45:28.174
QUARANTINE THE REST OF THE 99%

05:45:28.240 --> 05:45:30.709
AS HARTNETT HOME. GETTING MORE

05:45:30.776 --> 05:45:32.111
SICK AND SEEN THE NUMBERS DRIVE

05:45:32.178 --> 05:45:33.746
UP AN ILLNESS AN INFECTION RATE

05:45:33.813 --> 05:45:36.048
THE CALL THE NINETEEN. I MEAN I

05:45:36.115 --> 05:45:37.917
PUT ON THE TABLE. MAYBE WE

05:45:37.983 --> 05:45:39.685
SHOULD TALK ABOUT A WEALTH TAX.

05:45:39.752 --> 05:45:40.920
BUT SOME PEOPLE ARE DOING

05:45:40.986 --> 05:45:43.122
JUSTICE COMFORTABLE TODAY. AS

05:45:43.189 --> 05:45:44.490
THEY WERE BEFORE THE PANDEMIC

05:45:44.557 --> 05:45:46.325
AND IN FACT SOME MIGHT ARGUE

05:45:46.392 --> 05:45:47.460
THAT THEY'RE EVEN DOING BETTER

05:45:47.526 --> 05:45:49.061
TODAY. THAN THEY WERE BEFORE

05:45:49.128 --> 05:45:51.530
THE PANDEMIC. I THINK WE SHOULD

05:45:51.597 --> 05:45:52.098
PUT ALL THOSE THINGS ON THE

05:45:52.164 --> 05:45:55.301
TABLE. AND TALK ABOUT. HAVING

05:47:36.168 --> 05:47:37.970
NIMBLE RESPONSE BY THE STATE

05:47:38.037 --> 05:47:39.738
BUT I THINK THE LEGISLATURE

05:47:39.805 --> 05:47:41.540
DEMONSTRATED ITS ABILITY TO ACT

05:47:41.607 --> 05:47:43.876
SWIFTLY AT THAT TIME TO PASS

05:47:43.943 --> 05:47:46.178
LEGISLATION AND I THINK THAT

05:47:46.245 --> 05:47:49.715
SOME OF THE PROPOSED LANGUAGE-

05:47:49.782 --> 05:47:51.850
GRANTS. UNUSUAL LEVEL OF

05:47:51.917 --> 05:47:53.018

05:47:55.087 --> 05:47:58.290
RE DIRECT FUNDS OR TO ALLOCATE

05:47:58.357 --> 05:48:00.893
FUNDS TO ANYTHING THAT COULD BE

05:48:00.960 --> 05:48:02.861
CONSIDERED CODE RELATED FOR

05:48:02.928 --> 05:48:05.998
EXAMPLE AND SO YOU KNOW WE JUST

05:48:06.065 --> 05:48:08.033
THINK THAT THAT'S SOMETHING

05:48:08.100 --> 05:48:10.269
THAT YOU WOULD AS A BODY WOULD

05:48:10.336 --> 05:48:13.105
WANT TO REVIEW AND CONSIDER

05:48:13.172 --> 05:48:15.174

ARE IN DETAIL SO THAT WE CAN

05:48:26.719 --> 05:48:28.854

05:49:03.956 --> 05:49:05.891
TODAY BY THE GOVERNOR OF THE

05:49:05.958 --> 05:49:07.459
STATE IN NEW YORK. A LOT OF

05:49:07.526 --> 05:49:10.062
BAD- DECISIONS WERE MADE A LOT

05:49:10.129 --> 05:49:11.597
OF MISTAKES WERE MADE. BASED

05:49:11.664 --> 05:49:12.898
UPON THE INFORMATION THAT WAS

05:49:12.965 --> 05:49:15.000
GIVEN AT THE TIME. SO WE'VE ALL

05:49:15.067 --> 05:49:16.201
LEARNED AS WE'VE GONE THROUGH

05:49:16.268 --> 05:49:17.770
THIS PROCESS LET'S ALL AGREE

05:49:17.836 --> 05:49:19.505
THAT WE CAN ALL DO BETTER. AND

05:49:19.571 --> 05:49:21.573
WORK TOGETHER IN A L. MORE

05:49:21.640 --> 05:49:22.941

THAT WE CAN BE MOST SUCCESSFUL-

05:49:25.210 --> 05:49:26.145
BUT I DON'T WANT TO SEE THE

05:49:26.211 --> 05:49:27.379
STATE OF CALIFORNIA OVER

05:49:27.446 --> 05:49:29.214
REACHING AND GOING ANY FARTHER.

05:49:29.281 --> 05:49:30.082

INSTEAD OF ITS ATTENDED PROMISE

05:50:05.117 --> 05:50:07.219
PURPOSE THAT WAS MENTIONED BY-

05:50:07.286 --> 05:50:08.187
I NEVER MY COLLEAGUES AND

05:50:08.253 --> 05:50:09.988
SECONDLY- FUNDING FOR HIGH

05:50:10.055 --> 05:50:11.056
SPEED RAIL REMAINS

05:50:11.123 --> 05:50:13.192
CONSPICUOUSLY UNAFFECTED GIVING

05:50:13.258 --> 05:50:14.593
IT RECEIVED A CONTINUES

05:50:14.660 --> 05:50:16.495

AUCTION PROCEEDS DESPITE

05:50:18.063 --> 05:50:19.131

BILLION DOLLARS OR WITH THE

05:50:20.866 --> 05:50:22.000
ADMINISTRATION CONSIDER MAKING

05:50:22.067 --> 05:50:23.435
ADJUSTMENTS TO HIGH SPEED RAIL

05:50:23.502 --> 05:50:24.703
REVENUES IN ORDER TO FUND

05:50:24.770 --> 05:50:26.071
EDUCATION OR HELP SCHOOL

05:50:26.138 --> 05:50:27.573
DISTRICTS WOULD WITH DISTANCE

05:50:27.639 --> 05:50:29.842
LEARNING. THIS FALL I WILL SAY

05:50:29.908 --> 05:50:32.010
THAT WE MUST ADJUST OUR

05:50:32.077 --> 05:50:33.812
PRIORITIES REFLECT OUR NEEDS AT

05:50:33.879 --> 05:50:35.381
THIS TIME AND BREAKING PROMISES

05:50:35.447 --> 05:50:36.315
BY SHIFTING TRANSPORTATION

05:50:36.382 --> 05:50:38.517
FUNDS AND NOT ADJUSTING HIGH

05:50:38.584 --> 05:50:39.485
SPEED RAIL FOR REVENUES TO FUND

05:50:39.551 --> 05:50:40.819
OTHER PRIORITIES SUCH AS

05:50:40.886 --> 05:50:42.287
EDUCATION DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO

05:50:42.354 --> 05:50:44.189
ME AND SO AS THIS WITH A

05:50:44.256 --> 05:50:45.557
MISTRESS HAS SAID TIME AND TIME

05:50:45.624 --> 05:50:47.025
AGAIN OUR BUDGET IS A

05:50:47.092 --> 05:50:48.026
REFLECTION OF OUR PRIORITIES

05:50:48.093 --> 05:50:49.795
HOWEVER IN THIS BUDGET WE I

05:50:49.862 --> 05:50:51.029
BELIEVE WE ARE NOT PUTTING OUR

05:50:51.096 --> 05:50:52.364
RESOURCES WHERE THEY ARE NEEDED

05:50:52.431 --> 05:50:55.167
MOST AND I WOULD LIKE TO. HEAR

05:50:55.234 --> 05:50:57.136
YOUR PERSPECTIVE. YES ON THE

05:50:57.202 --> 05:50:59.238
HIGH SPEED RAIL. THOSE MONIES

05:50:59.304 --> 05:51:00.706
THOSE CAP AND TRADE MONIES THAT

05:51:00.773 --> 05:51:02.508
ARE AT THAT HAVE BEEN ALLOCATED

05:51:02.574 --> 05:51:04.543
TO THE HIGH SPEED RAIL- THOSE

05:51:04.610 --> 05:51:06.245
ARE THOSE WILL BE SPENT ON ON

05:51:06.311 --> 05:51:08.414
COMPLETING THAT THE- THE- SECT.

05:51:08.480 --> 05:51:09.748
THE SECTION OF THE HIGH SPEED

05:51:09.815 --> 05:51:11.550
RAIL. IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY.

05:51:11.617 --> 05:51:14.620
AND THEY THE FEDERAL FUNDING-

05:51:14.686 --> 05:51:16.422
WORK THERE WAS A TIME LIMIT ON

05:51:16.488 --> 05:51:17.589
SPENDING THAT SO THAT'S THE

05:51:17.656 --> 05:51:19.758
MONEY THAT'S BEING SPENT FIRST-

05:51:19.825 --> 05:51:21.393
THERE ARE NO PROPOSED CHANGES

05:51:21.460 --> 05:51:22.294
TO THE HIGH SPEED RAIL IN THIS

05:51:22.361 --> 05:51:24.263
BUDGET. AND THAT BUDGET WE

05:51:24.329 --> 05:51:25.531
TALKED A LOT TODAY ABOUT

05:51:25.597 --> 05:51:26.799
INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE IMPORTANT

05:51:26.865 --> 05:51:28.333
EVENT AT PORTENTS OF

05:51:28.400 --> 05:51:30.202
INFRASTRUCTURE AS ONE WAY THAT

05:51:30.269 --> 05:51:31.804
GOVERNMENT CAN ACTUALLY SPUR

05:51:31.870 --> 05:51:33.839
AND ADD JOBS. AND THE HIGH

05:51:33.906 --> 05:51:35.674
SPEED RAIL HAS ADDED HUNDREDS

05:51:35.741 --> 05:51:37.743
OF THOUSANDS OF JOBS IN THE

05:51:37.810 --> 05:51:39.311
CENTRAL VALLEY- AND WILL

05:51:39.378 --> 05:51:40.846
CONTINUE TO OVER THE NEXT

05:51:40.913 --> 05:51:42.314
SEVERAL YEARS AS THE-

05:51:42.381 --> 05:51:43.949
CONSTRUCTION CONTINUES TO RAMP

05:51:44.016 --> 05:51:46.084
UP- SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT'S

05:51:46.151 --> 05:51:48.353
HAPPENING NOW. SO TO STOP THAT

05:51:48.420 --> 05:51:50.522
WOULD BE REALLY DETRIMENTAL TO

05:51:50.589 --> 05:51:52.224
THAT TO THAT EFFORT THAT'S BEEN

05:51:52.291 --> 05:51:54.693
GOING ON- AND THEN I KNOW I

05:51:54.760 --> 05:51:55.961
KNOW THAT YOU HAD ANOTHER

05:51:56.028 --> 05:51:56.962
QUESTION AT THE BEGINNING THEN

05:51:57.029 --> 05:51:58.330
I GOT IT JUST LIKE THEY KNOW

05:51:58.397 --> 05:51:59.998
THE JUSTIFICATION FOR THE

05:52:00.065 --> 05:52:01.467
TRANSFER. OF FILES THAT I TO

05:52:01.533 --> 05:52:02.201
THE STATE OUR ACCOUNTS OF THE

05:52:02.267 --> 05:52:03.569
STATE HIGHWAY ACCOUNT THE

05:52:03.635 --> 05:52:04.503
MONIES THAT WERE TRANSFERRED

05:52:04.570 --> 05:52:06.371
AND AGAIN. LOOKING ALL ACROSS

05:52:06.438 --> 05:52:07.739
STATE GOVERNMENT AND ALL

05:52:07.806 --> 05:52:09.575
DIFFERENT AREAS FROM FUNDS THAT

05:52:09.641 --> 05:52:11.243
COULD BE BORROWED OR

05:52:11.310 --> 05:52:12.344
TRANSFERRED AND WE IN THAT AND

05:52:12.411 --> 05:52:15.047
THAT IS. NOT IDEAL- BUT GIVEN

05:52:15.113 --> 05:52:16.815
THE MAGNITUDE OF THIS CRISIS WE

05:52:16.882 --> 05:52:17.916
THINK THAT SOME INTERNAL

05:52:17.983 --> 05:52:19.818
BORROWING AS NECESSARY. TO

05:52:19.885 --> 05:52:23.021
REALLY AVOID THE HARSHEST CUTS-

05:52:23.088 --> 05:52:24.923
IN SO THAT THAT- STATE HIGHWAY

05:52:24.990 --> 05:52:26.124
ACCOUNT THOSE OUR INTEREST

05:52:26.191 --> 05:52:28.026
EARNINGS AND THAT THE IDEA IS

05:52:28.093 --> 05:52:29.127
THAT THOSE WOULD BE ABLE TO BE

05:52:29.194 --> 05:52:30.596
TRANSFERRED. TO THE GENERAL

05:52:30.662 --> 05:52:32.364
FUND. IT JUST IT WAS JUST OF

05:52:32.431 --> 05:52:34.166
ART ARE NOT PROTECTED UNDER THE

05:52:34.233 --> 05:52:36.168
THAT I'M ARTICLE NINETEEN OF

05:52:36.235 --> 05:52:37.703
THE CONSTITUTION. I SEE THAT

05:52:37.769 --> 05:52:38.570
THERE'S THE SEMANTICS THERE BUT

05:52:38.637 --> 05:52:39.538
I WOULD JUST LIKE THE I MEAN I

05:52:39.605 --> 05:52:40.772
MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THERE

05:52:40.839 --> 05:52:42.374
IS NO INTENT BY DEMONSTRATION

05:52:42.441 --> 05:52:43.809
TO BACK FILL ANY OF THOSE FUNDS

05:52:43.876 --> 05:52:45.010
ARE TRANSFERRED. SO THAT WOULD

05:52:45.077 --> 05:52:46.879
BE TRANSPLANT OUR TRANSFERS ARE

05:52:46.945 --> 05:52:49.014
TRANSFERS LOANS OR LOANS AND

05:52:49.081 --> 05:52:49.681
LOANS WOULD BE REPAID WITH

05:52:49.748 --> 05:52:51.550
INTEREST. SO THIS IS SO IT

05:52:51.617 --> 05:52:52.918
WOULD OPENING WOULD BE THIS ONE

05:52:52.985 --> 05:52:57.422
IS MY AND- MY UNDERSTANDING. IS

05:52:57.489 --> 05:52:59.024
INTEREST EARNINGS THAT WOULD BE.
