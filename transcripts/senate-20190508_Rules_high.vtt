SERVICE TO THE STATE OF

00:23:27.405 --> 00:23:28.673
CALIFORNIA.

00:23:28.740 --> 00:23:30.842
AND ONE THING I GLEANED FROM OUR

00:23:30.909 --> 00:23:32.144
CONVERSATION.

00:23:32.210 --> 00:23:34.946
WE HAVE MANY HEROES IN AMERICAN

00:23:35.013 --> 00:23:37.149
INDUSTRY WHO STARTED IN THE MAIL

00:23:37.215 --> 00:23:39.684
ROOM AND YOU SHARED WITH ME.

00:23:39.751 --> 00:23:41.586
THAT YOU ALSO STARTED IN THE

00:23:41.653 --> 00:23:43.922
MAIL ROOM AND LOOK LOOK WHERE

00:23:43.989 --> 00:23:46.291
YOU HAVE ENDED UP A LOT OF HARD

00:23:46.358 --> 00:23:48.059
WORK AND COMMITMENT AND I

00:23:48.126 --> 00:23:50.262
IMAGINE FAMILY SUPPORT.

00:23:50.328 --> 00:23:53.131
AS WELL ALONG THE WAY -- I JUST

00:23:53.198 --> 00:23:54.966
WANT TO ASK A QUESTION THAT --

00:23:55.033 --> 00:23:56.368
WE TALKED ABOUT YESTERDAY

00:23:56.434 --> 00:23:58.136
BECAUSE I THINK THE COMMITTEE

00:23:58.203 --> 00:23:59.404
WOULD FIND IT OF INTEREST.

00:23:59.471 --> 00:24:02.507
THE CHALLENGE OF PAY EQUITY --

00:24:02.574 --> 00:24:03.842
ENDS.

00:24:03.909 --> 00:24:06.311
GENDER DISCRIMINATION IN PAY

00:24:06.378 --> 00:24:09.514
EQUITY -- WITH STATE JOBS I

00:24:09.581 --> 00:24:11.116
THINK MY BELIEF WAS WELL IF YOU

00:24:11.183 --> 00:24:15.020
HAVE A JOB CLASSIFICATION.

00:24:15.086 --> 00:24:15.554
ANYONE WITHIN THAT

00:24:15.620 --> 00:24:17.656
CLASSIFICATION WOULD RECEIVE THE

00:24:17.722 --> 00:24:20.692
SAME COMPENSATION BUT YOU HELP

00:24:20.759 --> 00:24:21.793
ME UNDERSTAND IT'S A LITTLE MORE

00:24:21.860 --> 00:24:23.829
COMPLICATED THAN THAT AND YOU

00:24:23.895 --> 00:24:26.031
TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT.

00:24:26.097 --> 00:24:28.400
HELL WORK IS VALUED IN DIFFERENT

00:24:28.466 --> 00:24:29.901
CLASSIFICATIONS AND I WONDER IF

00:24:29.968 --> 00:24:32.304
YOU COULD JUST SHARE A LITTLE OF

00:24:32.370 --> 00:24:34.406
THAT WITH THE COMEDIAN.

00:24:34.472 --> 00:24:35.941
YOUR THOUGHTS OF HOW.

00:24:36.007 --> 00:24:37.976
WE DO TAKE THAT ON AND IT

00:24:38.043 --> 00:24:39.144
SOUNDED A LITTLE MORE

00:24:39.211 --> 00:24:40.846
CHALLENGING IN A LITTLE MORE

00:24:40.912 --> 00:24:42.414
COMPLEX THAN I MIGHT HAVE

00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:45.016
THOUGHT AT THE OUTSET YEAH -- IN

00:24:45.083 --> 00:24:46.451
OUR CONVERSATION YESTERDAY --

00:24:46.518 --> 00:24:48.653
THE GENDER PAY GAP IS ACTUALLY A

00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:49.888
LITTLE BIT COMPLEX FOR THE STATE

00:24:49.955 --> 00:24:51.623
OF CALIFORNIA BECAUSE SALARIES

00:24:51.690 --> 00:24:54.125
ARE SET -- AND IT DOESN'T MATTER

00:24:54.192 --> 00:24:56.595
WHICH GENDER -- YOU HAVE

00:24:56.661 --> 00:25:00.732
PARTICULAR SALARY HOWEVER WOMEN

00:25:00.799 --> 00:25:02.901
HAVE MOSTLY BEEN GEARED TOWARD

00:25:02.968 --> 00:25:06.004
CLERICAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCES AND

00:25:06.071 --> 00:25:07.672
YESTERDAY I KIND OF GAVE YOU THE

00:25:07.739 --> 00:25:08.807
EXAMPLE.

00:25:08.874 --> 00:25:10.475
OF OF A DOUBT ADOPTION

00:25:10.542 --> 00:25:12.110
SPECIALISTS WHO REQUIRES A

00:25:12.177 --> 00:25:15.347
MASTER'S DEGREE -- TO DO THE JOB

00:25:15.413 --> 00:25:16.748
DOESN'T RECEIVE AN MSA ON MERRY

00:25:16.815 --> 00:25:18.717
SALLY ADJUSTMENT TILL AFTER

00:25:18.783 --> 00:25:19.484
TWENTY FOUR MONTHS.

00:25:19.551 --> 00:25:21.519
HOWEVER A CORRECTIONAL OFFICER

00:25:21.586 --> 00:25:23.421
IN A HIGHWAY PATROL OFFICER ONLY

00:25:23.488 --> 00:25:27.058
REQUIRE A HIGH SCHOOL DEGREE AND

00:25:27.125 --> 00:25:27.626
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THE

00:25:27.692 --> 00:25:30.262
STUDIES THAT WE HAD WITH UC

00:25:30.328 --> 00:25:32.163
BERKELEY AND TAX STATE.

00:25:32.230 --> 00:25:33.965
THE REPORT SHOWS THAT OTHER

00:25:34.032 --> 00:25:35.200
STATES LIKE MINNESOTA AND

00:25:35.267 --> 00:25:36.935
WASHINGTON HAD DONE SOME

00:25:37.002 --> 00:25:39.237
RESEARCH AND ACTUALLY DID SOME

00:25:39.304 --> 00:25:41.940
INFORMATION ABOUT THE VALUE OF

00:25:42.007 --> 00:25:47.545
WORK AND HOW.

00:25:47.612 --> 00:25:48.847
THE WORK SHE DID.

00:25:48.914 --> 00:25:50.916
BE ANALYZED BASED ON THE SKILLS

00:25:50.982 --> 00:25:52.150
THE RESPONSIBILITY EFFORT AND

00:25:52.217 --> 00:25:53.184
THE WORKPLACE CONDITIONS TO

00:25:53.251 --> 00:25:55.320
MEASURE THE VALUE AND TO PROVIDE

00:25:55.387 --> 00:25:56.855
AN OPPORTUNITY.

00:25:56.922 --> 00:25:58.590
TO IDENTIFY THE GENDER PAY GAP

00:25:58.657 --> 00:26:01.192
OR GAPS AND AND FIX THEM

00:26:01.259 --> 00:26:02.594
ACCORDINGLY.

00:26:02.661 --> 00:26:06.097
I FOUND THAT VERY INTERESTING IN.

00:26:06.164 --> 00:26:08.033
IMPLICIT WITHIN THAT COMPARISON

00:26:08.099 --> 00:26:10.902
IS THAT A MALE CORRECTIONAL

00:26:10.969 --> 00:26:12.237
OFFICER WITH A HIGH SCHOOL

00:26:12.304 --> 00:26:13.338
DIPLOMA.

00:26:13.405 --> 00:26:16.241
WOULD BE COMPENSATED AT A HIGHER

00:26:16.308 --> 00:26:18.376
LEVEL THAN THE ADOPTION

00:26:18.443 --> 00:26:19.477
SPECIALIST WITH A MASTER'S

00:26:19.544 --> 00:26:24.015
DEGREE -- A FEMALE.

00:26:24.082 --> 00:26:25.417
TRADUCTION SPECIALIST IS THAT

00:26:25.483 --> 00:26:27.919
THERE'S ACTUALLY A 13% GAP

00:26:27.986 --> 00:26:29.888
BETWEEN AN ADOPTION SPECIALISTS

00:26:29.955 --> 00:26:32.090
IN A CORRECTIONAL OFFICER AND A

00:26:32.157 --> 00:26:33.959
36% GAP BETWEEN ADOPTION

00:26:34.025 --> 00:26:37.095
SPECIALIST AND A C. H. P. OFF.

00:26:37.162 --> 00:26:39.998
AND HOW DO WE BEGIN TO RECONCILE

00:26:40.065 --> 00:26:41.366
THAT WHAT DID YOU LEARN FROM

00:26:41.433 --> 00:26:43.268
THESE OTHER STATES EXPERIENCE

00:26:43.335 --> 00:26:44.669
ARE THEY AHEAD OF US IN.

00:26:44.736 --> 00:26:46.438
TRYING [inaudible]

00:26:46.504 --> 00:26:49.774
TO THEY THE QUALITY OF A THINNER.

00:26:49.841 --> 00:26:51.309
AND WHAT HAVE YOU LEARNED FROM

00:26:51.376 --> 00:26:53.144
THEIR EFFORTS WELL I'VE I'VE

00:26:53.211 --> 00:26:56.147
LEARNED THAT -- LOOKING AT THE

00:26:56.214 --> 00:26:57.816
VALUE WORK COULD BE EXPENSIVE --

00:26:57.882 --> 00:26:59.117
IT'S SOMETHING THAT I THINK THE

00:26:59.184 --> 00:27:01.052
STATE OF CALIFORNIA SHOULD LOOK

00:27:01.119 --> 00:27:03.288
AT ALONG WITH NON TRADITIONAL

00:27:03.355 --> 00:27:04.856
APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS FOR

00:27:04.923 --> 00:27:08.893
WOMEN -- THAT WOULD HELP CLOSED

00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:10.495
AT THE PAY GAP.

00:27:10.562 --> 00:27:12.097
WE ACTUALLY HAVE HAD A COUPLE OF

00:27:12.163 --> 00:27:17.068
MENTORSHIP THE I. D..

00:27:17.135 --> 00:27:17.936
A PROGRAM THAT WAS SPEARHEADED

00:27:18.003 --> 00:27:19.571
BY THE GOVERNMENT AGENCY -- I

00:27:19.637 --> 00:27:21.339
BELIEVE THAT WE SHOULD ALSO LOOK

00:27:21.406 --> 00:27:23.975
INTO A STATEWIDE MENTORSHIP

00:27:24.042 --> 00:27:25.143
PROGRAM FOR WOMEN.

00:27:25.210 --> 00:27:27.312
THANK YOU AND WE COULD.

00:27:27.379 --> 00:27:28.980
PURSUE THIS I HOPE WILL HAVE A

00:27:29.047 --> 00:27:30.382
CHANCE.

00:27:30.448 --> 00:27:31.483
AS WE WORK WITH THE IN THE

00:27:31.549 --> 00:27:33.184
FUTURE AND I THINK WE HAVE THE

00:27:33.251 --> 00:27:35.420
RIGHT PERSON FOR THE JOB SO.

00:27:35.487 --> 00:27:37.022

AND THANK YOU SENATOR FOR FOR

00:27:45.063 --> 00:27:46.831
STARTING AT LINE OF OF QUESTIONS --

00:27:46.898 --> 00:27:47.966
DIALOGUE.

00:27:48.033 --> 00:27:52.904
IN TERMS OF AN INCLUSIVE AND

00:27:52.971 --> 00:27:54.739

STRATEGIES FOR RECRUITMENT THIS

WAS ONE OF OUR STAFF QUESTIONS

00:28:01.646 --> 00:28:03.648
IT'S A REALLY GOOD QUESTION

00:28:03.715 --> 00:28:05.483
REGARDLESS OF WHERE WE ARE.

00:28:05.550 --> 00:28:07.052
IN MANAGEMENT IN THE STATE

00:28:07.118 --> 00:28:10.188

RECRUITMENT EFFORTS -- WE HAVE

00:28:22.300 --> 00:28:25.003
IN THE PAST TAKEN A PASSIVE ROLE

PROACTIVE ROLE.

00:28:32.277 --> 00:28:33.978
AND I BELIEVE THAT DOING A

00:28:34.045 --> 00:28:35.213
LITTLE BIT MORE FOCUS

00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:37.916
RECRUITMENT WITH THOSE AREAS

00:28:37.982 --> 00:28:42.387
THAT WE ARE UNDER UTILIZED WOULD

00:28:42.454 --> 00:28:43.721
BE MORE OF A FICTIVE.

00:28:43.788 --> 00:28:46.491
ROACH TO OF PROVIDING DIVERSE

00:28:46.558 --> 00:28:48.626
CITY INTO OUR IN OUR WORK STATE

00:28:48.693 --> 00:28:51.096

00:28:58.303 --> 00:29:00.371
GREAT AT STREAMLINING OF

00:29:00.438 --> 00:29:02.841
REGULATION SAYS ACTUALLY HELP IN

00:29:02.907 --> 00:29:05.710
THAT AREA TO HAVE MORE DISABLED.

00:29:05.777 --> 00:29:07.846
IN OUR WORK FORCE WE'VE ALSO

00:29:07.912 --> 00:29:09.414
PARTNERED WITH THE US MARINES

00:29:09.481 --> 00:29:12.217
COURT -- AND WE'VE DONE SOME

00:29:12.283 --> 00:29:16.121
FOCUS RECRUITMENT DOWN THERE --

IN THAT AREA.

00:29:41.779 --> 00:29:42.447
I SAW.

00:29:42.514 --> 00:29:44.649
AN A. IN TERMS OF LANGUAGE

00:29:44.716 --> 00:29:46.518
CAPABILITIES -- WE ARE

00:29:46.584 --> 00:29:49.087
INCREDIBLY DIVERSE AS A STATE.

00:29:49.154 --> 00:29:50.889
BUT IT SEEMS --YOU KNOW WE'RE

00:29:50.955 --> 00:29:52.290
ALWAYS TALKING ABOUT HOW TO

00:29:52.357 --> 00:29:53.424
INCREASE OUR LANGUAGE

00:29:53.491 --> 00:29:55.393
CAPABILITIES AND WHEN YOU TALK

00:29:55.460 --> 00:29:58.229
ABOUT DIVERSE -- INCLUSION AND

00:29:58.296 --> 00:30:00.231
RECRUITMENT THEY'RE PROBABLY OUR

00:30:00.298 --> 00:30:01.966
COMMUNITIES WERE BETTER FOCUS AN

00:30:02.033 --> 00:30:03.501
OUT REACH COULD BE DONE.

00:30:03.568 --> 00:30:07.939
I I CAN'T I CAN'T SPEAK TO THE

00:30:08.006 --> 00:30:10.208
OUR REQUIREMENT LEVEL IN TERMS

00:30:10.275 --> 00:30:12.343
OF EDUCATION BUT WHERE HAVE YOU

00:30:12.410 --> 00:30:14.045
SEEN AREAS ARE EVIDENCE WHERE

00:30:14.112 --> 00:30:15.780
THERE ARE PARTICULAR PLACES

00:30:15.847 --> 00:30:17.215
WHERE WE NEED MORE LANGUAGE

00:30:17.282 --> 00:30:20.218
DIVERSITY AND THOUGHTS ON HOW.

00:30:20.285 --> 00:30:22.420
TO TO WORK ON THAT.

00:30:22.487 --> 00:30:26.291
WELL -- YES AND NO -- WE

00:30:26.357 --> 00:30:27.859
ACTUALLY HAVE A ONE EIGHT

00:30:27.926 --> 00:30:30.028
HUNDRED LINE FOR ANYONE THAT HAS

00:30:30.094 --> 00:30:32.397
ANY ISSUES WITH LANGUAGE AND WE

00:30:32.463 --> 00:30:34.766
WILL PROVIDE INTERPRETERS AT THE

00:30:34.832 --> 00:30:35.800
STATE EXPERIENCE FOR ANYBODY

THAT.

00:30:36.401 --> 00:30:39.337
NEEDS THAT TYPE OF ASSISTANCE --

00:30:39.404 --> 00:30:41.906
THE LINE FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND

00:30:41.973 --> 00:30:45.944
WE PROBABLY MAYBE ON AVERAGE GET

00:30:46.010 --> 00:30:47.478
FIVE TO TEN CALLS A MONTH --

00:30:47.545 --> 00:30:49.981
WHICH SEEMS TO BE KIND OF LOW

00:30:50.048 --> 00:30:51.950
FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

00:30:52.016 --> 00:30:53.351
DO YOU THINK IT'S A MATTER OF
