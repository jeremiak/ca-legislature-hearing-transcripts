YOUTH -- ES YOU DE TREATMENT SERVICES TO INCLUDE ANY PUBLICLY FUNDED DIRECT SERVICE INTENDED TO ADDRESS OR TREAT S. YOU DIS FOR INDIVIDUALS FROM BIRTH -- TO TWENTY SIX CALIFORNIA'S MADE NUMEROUS ATTEMPTS TO ADDRESS. THE COMPLEX NOT OF ISSUES RELATED TO MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND IN OUR SYSTEM AND PROGRAMS DON'T SEEM TO CARRY OUT OUR INTENTIONS. WE SEE THE RESULTS AROUND US ON THE STREETS IN OUR SCHOOLS AND IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM MULTIPLE STUDIES HAVE ESTABLISHED THAT ADOLESCENTS ARE MORE VULNERABLE THAN ADULTS TO ALCOHOL CANNABIS TOBACCO AND OTHER DRUG RELATED. PROBLEMS SERVICES FOR YOUTH NEED TO BE INTEGRATED AND WRAPAROUND SERVICES ARE NECESSARY AYE THIS BILL SEEKS TO ADDRESS ALL OF THESE ISSUES TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF A YOUTH INTERVENTION PREVENTION AND TREATMENT STANDARDS FOR CHILDREN. TODAY I HAVE WITH ME AND NUMBER FOLKS ONE SPEAKING IN SUPPORT. WE DON'T HAVE A QUORUM UNFORTUNATELY BUT I APPRECIATE YOUR ENTHUSIASM. I LOVE THAT SHOW IS READY -- TO WE HAVE TO WITNESSES -- THREE MINUTES EACH PLEASE. THANK YOU -- MEMBERS ASSEMBLY HEALTH COMMITTEE THANK YOU CHAIRMAN WOULD -- MY NAME IS DOCTOR DAVID CONN AND THEN THE PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA SOCIETY OF ADDICTION MEDICINE. I WANTED TO START WITH THE STORY JACK FROM NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WAS TWELVE YEARS OLD WHEN HE BEGAN TO SMOKE CANNABIS DRINK ALCOHOL REGULARLY. HIS SUBSTANCE USE HELP MUFFLE THE EMOTIONAL TURMOIL BECAUSE BY DIFFICULT FAMILY LIFE YOU BEGIN USING OXYCODONE. AND SHORTLY THEREAFTER BY HIS FRESHMAN YEAR IN HIGH SCHOOL HE BEGAN INJECTING HEROIN. IF YOU THINK YOU TO HELP WHERE THE STORY IS HEADED YOU MIGHT BE SURPRISED NOW IS TWENTIES AFTER YEARS OF ADDICTION JACK IS NOT ONLY IT STILL ALIVE HE'S RECLAIMING ITS LIFE. IN A PROCESS OF INCREDIBLE DEDICATION AND COURAGE. RECOVERY THROUGH MEDICAL TREATMENT WHICH PROVIDES BEHAVIORAL THERAPY SOCIAL SUPPORT. IN CRITICALLY MEDICINE TO MANAGE ADDICTION. JACK WAS LUCKY. FINDING TREATMENT IS A CHALLENGE BUT FINDING EFFECTIVE TREATMENT EVEN MORE SO. IS CALIFORNIA IS POISED TO INVEST NEW MONIES INTO YOU SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER. PREVENTION EARLY INTERVENTION TREATMENT WE NEED TO LOOK AT THE SUCCESS OF JACK AND OTHER PEOPLE TO GUIDE SOUND DECISION MAKING. NEW SOURCE OF FUNDING PROMISE AUGMENT YOU SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER TREATMENT BY HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ANNUALLY. THIS NEW SURGE OF FUNDING ADDRESSES ONE OF TWO PROBLEMS WE FACE IN CALIFORNIA THE FIRST PROBLEM IS ACCESS TO TREATMENT. NEARLY ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND CALIFORNIA YOUNG PEOPLE BETWEEN THE AGES OF TWELVE AND SEVENTEEN REPORTED THAT THEY NEEDED. BUT DID NOT GET AS YOU DE TREATMENT. IN TWENTY SIXTEEN FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY THOUSAND YOUNG CALIFORNIANS BETWEEN THE AGE OF TWELVE AND TWENTY FIVE MISUSED OPIOIDS AND SYNTHETIC OPIOIDS SUCH AS FENTANYL. AND THOSE FENTANYL'S ARE ADDING A TWIST IN A STORY IN THAT IT IS DANGEROUS IT IS THAT. OUR PEOPLE ARE DYING. BUT THERE'S A SECOND FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM THAT WE NEED TO ADDRESS ACCESS TO TREATMENT ALONE IS NOT ENOUGH JACK FOR EXAMPLE CYCLE IN AND OUT OF THE SYSTEM HALF DOES WITH YOUR HALF DOZEN TREATMENT PROGRAMS. THAT DIDN'T USE EVIDENCE BASED BACK BEST PRACTICES. NON EVIDENCE BASED TREATMENTS FAILED HIM THAT COULD HAVE COST HIM HIS LIFE. INSTEAD WE MUST PROVIDE ACCESS TO EFFECTIVE RESULTS BASED TREATMENT THAT IS APPROPRIATE FOR YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE SPECIAL AND DIFFERENT NEEDS PHYSICALLY. EMOTIONALLY SOCIALLY AND ACADEMICALLY. DEVELOPMENTALLY A YOUNG PERSONS BRAIN IS SIMPLY DIFFERENT YOUNG BRAIN FINISHES DEVELOPING AT THE AGE OF TWENTY FIVE ADDICTION CHANGES THE BRAIN IN INTERRUPTS DECISION MAKING PROCESSES. NOT RELATED TO JUDGMENT GOOD JUDGMENT AND DECISION MAKING. IT HAVE ADDICTION HAMPER OCIAL DEVELOPMENT AND DERAILS THE CRUCIAL FINAL YEARS OF MATURATION. YOUNG PERSON WHO IS STRUGGLING WITH ADDICTIONS ALSO PART OF THE FAMILY AND THE ENTIRE FAMILY MAY NEED HELP AS WELL. FINALLY MUST WE MEET MUST BE THE EVER WEAR THAT CHILDREN AND TEENS ARE JUST HAVE NOT EXPOSE A PROBLEM IN THE PAST BUT THEY COULD BE EXPOSED TO TRAUMA CURRENTLY SO WE NEED TO ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES. THAT IS WHY MY ORGANIZATION THE CALIFORNIA SOCIETY OF ADDICTION MEDICINE. IS SPONSORING LEGISLATION S. B. TWO SEVENTY FIVE TO CREATE CLEAR STANDARDS FOR USE SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER PREVENTION. EARLY INTERVENTION AND TREATMENT. THE BILL WOULD INVOLVE PEDIATRICIANS PSYCHIATRISTS SOCIAL SERVICES EDUCATIONAL EXPERTS AS WELL AS YOU THINK PARENTS. SO IN SUMMARY I APPRECIATE YOUR SUPPORT FOR S. B. TWO SEVENTY FIVE TO CREATE. A TREATMENT SYSTEM THAT WORKS THANK YOU. VERY MUCH DOCTOR. MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS ROBERT HARRIS ON BEHALF OF BESSIE AYE YOU CALIFORNIA. WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH SEE SAM TO DEVELOP THIS BILL FOR ALMOST A YEAR IT TOOK A LONG TIME TO FIGURE OUT. WHAT'S THE BEST APPROACH BUT WE KNOW WE ALL KNOW THAT THIS SOMETHING MUST BE DONE BECAUSE WE CAN'T LET CHILDREN SUFFER WITH BAD TREATMENT WHEN WE FINALLY HAVE MONEY TO GIVE THEM GOOD TREATMENT. SO STANDARDS ARE THE CRITICAL THING THAT SPLIT THE BILLS HELPS CREATE. AND WE WOULD APPRECIATE YOUR SUPPORT FOR THE BILL THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIRMAN RANDALL HAGER FOR THE CALIFORNIA PSYCHIATRIC ASSOCIATION WERE VERY HAPPY TO CO SPONSOR THIS BILL HERE TO ANSWER ANY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OTHER SUPPORT JUST YOUR NAME AND ORGANIZATION PLEASE. OF MARKET DATA BY HALF SHATTERPROOF IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN FIRST MY CONSUMERS ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA HEALTH PLUS ADVOCATES IN THE THIRTEEN HUNDRED COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS IN CALIFORNIA AND SUPPORT THANK YOU. THAT'S YOUR ANSWER WITH THE COUNTY HEALTH EXECUTIVES ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT Q.. KELLY BROKE SOME BEHALF OF THE COUNTY WELFARE DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION PLEASED APPEARANCE PARTY GIVE. TOM RENT FREE WITH THE COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA IN SUPPORT. FAIR MCDADE TING ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES IN SUPPORT. JERRY DAILY WITH THE CALIFORNIA CONSORTIUM OF ADDICTION PROGRAMS AND PROFESSIONALS IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS HOME A HAVE WITH CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF ALCOHOL AND DRUG PROGRAM EXECUTIVES CAT PEE. OF THE DIRECTION OF THIS BILL BUT WE DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS AND WE'VE -- DISCUSS THOSE WITH. SIR AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORK AS THIS BILL MOVES THROUGH THE PROCESS THANK YOU. HELEN ROTH HADN'T HE JUST FOR HEALTHY KIDS WERE FINE WITH THE TREATMENT STANDARDS BUT WE HAVE A A PROVINCE WITH THE EARLY INTERVENTION AND PREVENTION. THIS IS REALLY -- AWAY TOWARDS PROP SIXTY FOUR IT'S BEEN A WHOLE STAKEHOLDERS PROCESS THAT THIS IS BY PASSING. IN WERE REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT THAT ON BOTH THE PROP SIXTY FOUR AND EARLY INTERVENTION AND PREVENTION WE THINK ARE VERY DIFFERENT THAN. THE TREATMENT STANDARDS THAT WOULD BE SET UP THAT'S FINE IT'S JUST TOO BROAD THANK YOU. GIVE. MISTER CHAIR TONY TRIGGER ON THE HAVE THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION WE APPRECIATE THE WORK THAT THE COMMITTEE CONSULTANT ON THE BILL WE HAVE AN OPPOSING LESS AMENDED WE'LL LOOK AT THE AMENDMENTS WHEN THEY'RE IN PRINT AND WE'LL GO FROM THERE. THANK YOU APPRECIATE IT. WE'RE GONNA PAUSE FOR A MINUTE AND THEN. WE HAVE TO GROW THINK WE MAY HAVE A QUORUM. WOULD HERE MAYES HERE AGAR CURRY. BIGELOW. BONTA BURKE CARILLO FLORA LIMON MCCARTY. THIS AREA RODRIGUEZ [inaudible] SANTIAGO BERMAN [inaudible] WALDRON. WE HAVE A QUORUM LEVEL. OKAY LIVE MOTION. AND THE SECOND IS THEIR OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. WE HEARD FROM SUPPORT AND US A COUPLE OF TWEENER SEPARATELY AND ONE OPPOSITION ANYONE ELSE. SEE NO ONE QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THAT SCIENCE MR MCCARTY THANK YOU I I JUST CAME IN SO I MISSED THE FIRST PART OF THE PRESENTATION BUT I SUPPORT THE EFFORT WE'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH HERE JUST A FEW. I QUESTIONS MAYBE CAN YOU CAN HELP ME HERE SO I I KNOW FROM THE PEOPLE IN BETWEEN THAT. KIND OF A DEBATE AS FAR AS TREATMENT AND PREVENTION AND WE WANT TO DO THEM BOTH HERE IN CALIFORNIA SO I JUST WANTED TO ASK. KIND OF YOUR VIEWS ON THAT AND HOW YOU KIND OF SEE THIS PLAYING OUT WITH. POTENTIAL PROP SIXTY FOUR REVENUES DOWN THE ROAD AND I KNOW YOU MENTIONED PROP SIXTY FOUR AND POTENTIALLY GENERAL FUND. BUT THAT WHAT'S YOUR WHAT'S YOUR INTENT ON THAT. HE'S GONNA GO FIRST [inaudible] JUST ABOUT. THROUGH THE CHAIR ARM. SO THE BILL MANTON IS UP PREVENTION AND EARLY INTERVENTION AND IT ASKS. THE COUNTY OFFICE EDUCATION TO WORK CLOSELY WITH THE COUNTY OFFICE THAT DOES TREATMENT TO MAKE SURE THAT. BECAUSE YOU CAN'T DO PREVENTION WITHOUT. HEMINGWAY TO TREATMENT FOR PEOPLE WHO THEATER EARLY AND A PASSION ARE FRENCH AND DOESN'T WORK. FOR THE SAME THING WHEN PEOPLE DRIVE IN THE PEOPLE WHO. IN THE TREATMENT COMMUNITY AND THEY MIGHT NOT NEED. THE DEPTH THE TREATMENT THEY OFFER BUT THEY CAN GET THE EARLY INTERVENTION THE SCHOOLS. SO THAT'S WHY THE BILL SO THEY SHOULD WORK TOGETHER. TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T HAVE STAND THE LOANS LITTLE FILO. THINGS THAT WE ACTUALLY WORKED TOGETHER. ACROSS THE BOARD WE DON'T SET STANDARDS FOR EARLY INTERVENTION. WE SET STANDARDS FOR TREATMENT WHICH IS A CRITICAL THING BECAUSE IT'S TOTALLY MISSING RIGHT NOW BECAUSE WE HAVE BEEN DOING TREATMENT FOR KIDS. OKAY SO IT IS THE IDEA THAT THOUGH THIS WOULD BE THE THE VESSEL TO HELP SHAPE PROP SIXTY FOUR FUNDING. WHERE WE WE OPENED TO THAT WOULD BE LOOKING AT SENATOR? I THINK THAT'S A CONVERSATION THAT PASSED THE CONTINUE I THINK THIS PRESENTS A FRAMEWORK TO INTEGRATE AND SORT OF MAKE EVERYTHING WORK MORE EFFICIENTLY AND I THINK THAT'S THE CONVERSATION YOU NEED TO GO ON I THINK THAT THE WORKING GROUP WITH ALL STAKEHOLDERS I THINK IS A PRAGMATIC STEP TO TRY TO HELP INTEGRATE ALL OF THE PROGRAMS OUT THERE. SO. I DON'T SEE THIS AS A HIERARCHAL THING I SEE IT AS AN INTEGRATED THING. FAIR ENOUGH HE KNOWS I KNOW IS A VERY DIFFERENT BUT SIMILAR TO OUR CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM. POT OF MONEY SCARCE POT LOT A GREAT IDEAS AND A LOT OF A COMPETITIONS WAS TO MAKE SURE THAT. WE PLEASE BUT FOCUS ON ON THE INTENT OF THE VOTERS AND SIXTY FOUR I'M. AND THEN LASTLY. THIS THE THE APPOINTMENTS ON HERE ARE PRETTY MUCH ALL WEEK ON THE HEALTH SIDE WHICH ISN'T A BAD THING REPORTS THE HEALTH COMMITTEE. BUT ON THE PREVENTION SIDE THERE WASN'T A LOT OF EDUCATOR AND THE I THINK THERE'S ONE OR TWO FROM THE S. P. AYE. AND THE MAJORITY ARE FROM. THE THAT HEALTH SIDE IS THAT. YOUR YOUR INTENT HAVE A MORE FOCUSED ON THAT TREATMENT SIDE BECAUSE IF YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT PREVENTION. THE ENTITY THAT DOES PREVENTION. IS THE PUBLIC EDUCATION. A A VENUE MAINLY IN CALIFORNIA AND THROUGH OUR PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM IN THROUGH OUR NOT. EARLY EDUCATION AND SO FORTH. SO I THINK IT'S A VALID POINT AND WE CAN HAVE A FURTHER CONVERSATION ON THAT -- BY THE THAT'S A GOOD POINT. THAT'S A WILL LOOK AT THE MAKE UP. AND YOU AND I CAN TALK ABOUT IT. IF THAT'S OKAY WITH THE CHAIR YOU KNOW. I THINK YOU. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. TOOK. SO GOODNESS MISSING HER NOW I JUST WANT TO COMMENT I REALLY APPRECIATE BEING THIS FOR ONE OF MY GOALS. IS WHATEVER WE CAN DO FOR MENTAL HEALTH HELP YOU ARE YOUNGSTERS AND I WOULD BE HONORED IF I CAN BE A CO AUTHOR [inaudible] SO [inaudible] ANYONE ELSE. SEE NO ONE WOULD YOU LIKE CLOSER RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH I APPRECIATE. VERY MUCH YOU BRING THIS THIS FORWARD AND TACKLING A VERY VERY DIFFICULT SUBJECT DOWN. AS I UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS MY UNDERSTAND IS THIS THE SEXY SETS THE STANDARDS AND THAT'S AND THAT'S ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL -- ULTIMATELY HOW WE FUND THIS AND IT WILL BE PLAYED OUT LATER WHETHER IT'S PROP SIXTY FOUR GENERAL FUND WHATEVER -- BUT THAT IS NOT. THE SCOPE OF THIS BILL AT THIS POINT IT IS ABOUT THE STANDARD SO SO I APPRECIATE THAT THOUGH THE BILL DOES ENJOY A DO PASS RECOMMENDATION I THINK YOU FOR THAT AND THEN THAT. THE I THINK YOU FOR ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS THAT MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS A MOTION WAS MADE BY MISTER MAYES AND SECONDED BY SOMEBODY. MISTER BIGELOW -- ALWAYS HERE ACTUALLY MUCH CAN. SO THOSE THAT WE HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. WHAT I WOULD AYE MAYES AYE MAYES AYE AGAR CURRY? ANGER CURRY I BIGELOW BUT I BIGELOW AYE BONTA BURKE CARILLO. FLORA. FLORA I LOW MOAN. MCCARTY TYPE MCCARTY AYE THIS AREA. RODRIGUEZ. RODRIGUEZ AYE. SANTIAGO. THURMOND. WALDRON. WALDRON AYE. IT. HAS GREAT EIGHT VOTES YOUR BILLS OUT WILL LEAVE IT OPEN FOR OTHER SAT ON THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR [inaudible] I SEE [inaudible] RIGHT. THE CENTER HUESO ARE YOU ARE YOU PRESENTING ON YOUR OWN OR WITH CENTER LARA OR OKAY [inaudible] PLEASE [inaudible] THANK YOU. PLEASE AS A ABOUT PERCENT. BUT THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT BILL FOR MY DISTRICT THAT IT EXPANDS ACCESSIBILITY TO QUALITY AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE. FOR INDIVIDUALS WORKING. IN THE SAN DIEGO AND IMPERIAL COUNTIES THIS IS OUR OF IS PARTICULARLY. ABOUT THE BORDER REGION WHICH HAS A VERY INTERESTING AND VERY DIFFERENT DIE NAPA SOCIAL DYNAMIC THAN THE OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE. WE HAVE -- A VERY IMPORTANT PROGRAM THAT WAS IMPLEMENTED ALONG THE BORDER THAT ALLOWS -- PEOPLE ARE THAT LIVE IN THE BORDER AREA TO ACCESS QUALITY COULD MEDICAL HIT CARE THAT IT'S LOCATED. IN THAT RIGHT AT THE BORDER. THE BORDER OF CALIFORNIA WITH MEXICO. YOU KNOW WE PRIDE OURSELVES IN CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN A VERY DIVERSE STATE. AND THE STATE THAT -- CELEBRATES OUR DIVERSITY. WE HAVE -- YOU KNOW TODAY IN IN THE BORDER AREA WE'RE STRUGGLING WITH SOME. ISSUES THAT -- MAKE. ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE VERY VERY DIFFICULT LONG BORDER -- THIS BILL HAS ARISEN FROM SOME OF OUR WORK THAT WE'VE DONE LOCALLY AT WITH OUR WITH OUR SELECT COMMITTEE ON ON COOPERATION WITH CALIFORNIA MEXICO. WE WE'VE WE DID -- A RECENT -- HEARING AT THE BORDER TO ADDRESS HEALTH ISSUES AND WE FIND THAT. SOME OF THE STATE'S MOST PRESSING HEALTH ISSUES ARE FOUND AT THE BORDER SIMPLY BECAUSE OF THE OF THE OF THE THAT THE DYNAMICS OF OTHER VERY FLUID AND AND A VERY ACTIVE BORDER. WE I HAD A BILL THAT -- WAS TRYING TO GET THAT THE OFFICE OF BORDER BI NATIONAL HELPED WORK ON A STRATEGY ON IMPROVING HEALTH AT THE BORDER. BUT THIS BILL IT IS MUCH BETTER THIS BILL OF WHAT IT WOULD EXPAND OF THE SCOPE OF OF BUT OF ACCESS OF ELIGIBILITY FOR PEOPLE LIVING LONG BORDER [inaudible] TO TO QUALIFY. FOR A A HEALTHCARE PROGRAM THAT IT WAS A CREATED BY OUR STATE SEVERAL YEARS BACK. IN PARTICULAR THIS BILL WOULD OF THIS BILL WOULD YEAH. HELP HER TO MAKE SURE THAT -- A PROGRAM CALLED SIMPSON WHICH OFFERS HEALTH CARE AND BROKE BORDER IS MADE MORE AVAILABLE TO ANYBODY. THAT WANTS TO ACCESS THAT PROGRAM CURRENTLY. THIS PROGRAM EXISTS IT'S ONLY ACCESSIBLE TO PEOPLE THAT HAVE I HAVE -- MEXICAN -- NATIONALITY OR MEXICAN -- OF OF MEXICAN ORIGIN LIVING IN THE UNITED STATES WORKING IN THE UNITED STATES -- AND THIS WOULD EXPAND IT BEYOND THAT TO PEOPLE THAT ARE LIVE ALONG THE BORDER REGION THAT ONE APART TO SPEND PROGRAM. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT MAKES THIS EXCITING. IS THAT SAMSUNG OFFERS A A VERY WIDE ARRAY OF OF PROGRAMS TREATMENTS. I THOUGHT THAT OFTEN ARE NOT AVAILABLE ON ON OUR SIDE OF THE BORDER. BUT THEY ALSO PROVIDE -- HIGH QUALITY SERVICE AT A VERY AFFORDABLE RATE. SO WE HAVE SOME TESTIMONY HERE THAT ARE SPEAK -- TO WHY WHY THIS IS THIS BILLS NECESSARY WHY IT'S IMPORTANT TO OFFER IT TO THE PEOPLE OF OF THOSE TWO COUNTIES ALONG THE BORDER [inaudible] AND WHY -- THIS WOULD BE A GOOD BILL TO SUPPORT. FO THE BENEFIT OF CALIFORNIANS -- THIS BILL SEEKS TO EXPAND HEALTH CARE OPTIONS AND SEND YOU ON A PER COUNTIES. BY ALLOWING EMPLOYERS. IN THOSE REGIONS TO PARTNER WITH SIMPSON. OF THE SIMPSON HEALTH PLAN FOR THEIR EMPLOYER. SPONSORED HEALTH GROUPS BEYOND JUST MEXICAN NATIONALS AND THEIR DEPENDENTS. SOME SAYS ONE OF THE LEADING HEALTH MAINTENANCE ORGANIZATIONS IN NORTHERN MEXICO AND SINCE TWO THOUSAND HAS PROVIDED OVER FORTY SEVEN THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS WITH AFFORDABLE QUALITY ALTERNATIVE. TO THE TRADITIONAL HMO. WE HAVE CHI MAK. MARIAMA HE'S A LITTLE BIT TO COUNSEL FIRST SIMPSON. I JAMIE MARIAMA SORRY. WE CALL THE I JUST CHANGE YOUR YOUR GENDER THERE SORRY. JAMIE I'M MEADOW YAMASKA LEGAL COUNSEL WITH SOME SUCH IS HERE TO ANSWER TECH TECHNICAL QUESTIONS OF COMMITTEE MEMBERS SHOULD HAVE ANY. WE HAVE WILLIAM BECAUSE HE CAN'T CAMPBELL WHO IS AND WHO IS EMPLOYED AT A CAR DEALERSHIP IN MY DISTRICT AND HE IS. HERE TO SPEAK ON HIS EXPERIENCES WITH SIMPSON. AND WE ALSO HAVE A REPRESENTATIVE FROM SINCE -- HERE OF TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS IF ANY SHOULD HAPPEN IF -- LOW WHO DID YOU WANT US SURE BUT A GOOD AFTERNOON TWO WITNESSES THREE MINUTES EACH SO. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN OF MIGHT AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME'S JAMIE MORIYAMA AND I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF SINCE THE HEALTH PLAN. BUT IN A FEW MINUTES YOU'LL HEAR FROM MR -- CAMPBELL AND THE REASON WHY WE ARE SPONSORING THIS BILL. OUR PLAN IS UNIQUE OUR NETWORK IS IN MEXICO AND MEMBERS WHO ELECT OUR PLAN ARE CHOOSING TO RECEIVE PRIMARY CARE FROM PROVIDERS IN MEXICO. WHEN THIRTEEN FIFTY ONE POINT TWO WAS FIRST PASS AND THAT'S HOW WE'RE LICENSE IT WAS LIMITED FOR THE BENEFIT OF MEXICAN CITIZENS LEGALLY EMPLOYED IN CALIFORNIA? DUE TO THE IMMIGRATION LAWS THOSE MEXICAN CITIZENS WERE THREATENED WITH THE LOSS OF COVERAGE. UPON BECOMING A NATURALIZED U. S. CITIZEN. DUAL CITIZENSHIP WAS NOT ALLOWED AT THE TIME HENCE THE CHANGE TO MEXICAN NATIONAL WHERE WE'RE AT TODAY. WE ARE A UNIQUE PLAN AND WE'RE NOT GONNA BE FOR EVERYONE HOWEVER IF SOMEONE LIKE MR CAMPBELL WHO WANTS AN AFFORDABLE OPTION. AND IS WILLING TO RECEIVE CARE MEXICO WANTS TO JOIN THE PLAN WE DO NOT WANT TO HAVE TO TURN HIM AWAY DUE TO HIS NATIONALITY. OUR CURRENT MEMBERSHIP TOTALS APPROXIMATELY FORTY SEVEN THOUSAND WHICH INCLUDES PRIMARY SUBSCRIBERS AND THEIR DEPENDENTS. SHOULD SHOULD SIMPSON MEMBERSHIP GROWTH DUE TO THE CHANGING NATIONALITY REQUIREMENTS. SINCE THE HOUSE ABILITY TO MEET THAT NEED WE ARE NOT DECO TIMELY ACCESS REQUIREMENTS HOWEVER WE TRACK NETWORK ADEQUACY ON THEIR OWN ACCORD. WE DO THIS THROUGH OUR GRIEVANCE DEPARTMENT IN MEXICO. AND WE ALSO MONITOR UTILIZATION ON A MONTHLY BASIS TO TRACK POSITION APPOINTMENT USAGE AND ENROLLMENT NUMBERS TO ANTICIPATE NETWORK NEEDS WE LSO HAVE A WAIT LIST OF POSITIONS WAITING TO JOIN OUR NETWORK IN MEXICO. I THINK HERE'S A MISCONCEPTION ABOUT SENSA BECAUSE WE ARE UNIQUE IN WE ARE A MEXICAN HEALTHCARE PLAN THAT WE DO NOT COMPLY WITH THE REGULATIONS AND THE LAWS WHICH IS INCORRECT. WE COMPLY WITH ALL KNOCKS KEEN REQUIREMENTS IN A CA REQUIREMENTS TO THE EXTENT THAT WE CAN. I'D LIKE TO GIVE AN EXAMPLE IT MAY CLARIFY THE ISSUE -- WHEN THE A CA WAS IMPLEMENTED WE MET WITH OUR ACTUARIES? AND USE TO FEDERAL CALCULATOR TO TRY TO CREATE SMALL GROUP PRODUCTS THAT WOULD MEET THE METAL LEVER LEVELS IN NEAR THE STANDARD. PRODUCTS. DOING SO PROVED IMPOSSIBLE WITHOUT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF COPAYS THAT FAR EXCEEDED 50% OF THE ACTUAL COST OF SERVICE TO THE PLAN. SO WE RECEIVED AN EXEMPTION AND WE HAVE TO ALTERNATE PLANS FOR SMALL GROUPS AND BOTH OF THEM EXCEED 90% IN VALUE. THEY'RE VERY RICH PLANS. SO SIMPSON IS UNIQUE. WE ARE NOT ANY BETTER OR ANY WORSE THAN ANY CALIFORNIA BASED HEALTH PLAN WERE JUST DIFFERENT. SENATE BILL SIX FORTY ONE WILL PROVIDE CONSUMERS WITH ANOTHER OPTION FOR HEALTH CARE. SINCE EXPRESSES ITS STRONG SUPPORT FOR THIS BILL AND WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST THE SAME FROM THIS COMMITTEE [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] CAMPBELL. GOOD AFTERNOON EVERYBODY MONIES WHEN COFFEE CAMPBELL MOST SINGLE FILE FROM SENEGAL CALIFORNIA OR WORK FOR FRANK AUTO GROUP I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF SOME SO HEALTH PLAN AND CRISTINA CARRILLO.

MONTH BOTH WOULD HAVE BEEN A ROUGHLY AROUND FOUR DOLLARS. I WITH COST OF LIVING AT ALL TIME HIGH. IT JUST DIDN'T MAKE ANY SENSE FOR ME FINANCIALLY. I WASN'T ABLE TO AFFORD INSURANCE IT'LL MOVE DEALERSHIPS. I FOUND OUT THAT MY CURRENT EMPLOYER PAYS HALF A MORE PREMIUM. SO WHEN IT CAME TIME TO CHOOSE WHICH INSURANCE PLAN OR ONE OF THE GOAL WITH. I WANTED TO CHOOSE SENSIBLE ONCE AGAIN. IT WASN'T AVAILABLE FOR ME. EVEN WITH MY EMPLOYER PAIN HAVE SINCE OF STILL WOULD HAVE BEEN CHEAPER TOOL. FOR BEING A SINGLE PARENT LIVING SENEGAL'S DEFTLY NOT EASY. WHEN TIMES ARE HARD WE SCRAMBLE IN THIS WORLD TO TRY TO SAVE A BUCK OR? TWO ALLOWING AMERICANS WHO WANT TO CHOOSE AN AFFORDABLE HEALTH PLAN AND GO OVER THE BORDER FOR CARE IT JUST MAKES SENSE. IT'S ARROGANT ACT AS THE THERE ARE VIABLE SOLUTIONS OUT THERE THAT BENEFIT AMERICAN CITIZENS. MEDICAL TRAVEL TOURISM ISRAEL AND FOR SOME WHO CAN'T AFFORD HEALTHCARE.

TO REMOVE OUR OPPOSITION WE ARE ASKING FOR A SET OF AMENDMENTS THAT TO THE FOLLOWING FIRST THAT IT WOULD CREATE A PUBLIC PROCESS FOR EXEMPTIONS FROM CONSUMER PROTECTIONS. SECOND APPLYING THE SAME FISCAL SOLVENCY STANDARDS THAT ALL OTHER HEALTH PLANS MEET CALL TANGIBLE NET EQUITY. AND LASTLY REQUIRING EMPLOYER MUST OFFER A FULLY AC COMPLIANCE PLAN.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS HIGH HORIA -- TELEHEALTH IS EXPANDING ITS A VITAL PART OF OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. THAT INCREASES ACCESS TO CARE. TO AND LOWERS THE COST ESPECIALLY RURAL UNDERSERVED AREAS OF OUR STATE. PLANO CALIFORNIA THERE AT LEAST FIVE WEBSITES OR MOBILE APPS THAT PATIENTS CAN USE REQUEST HAS FOR CERTAIN STDS OR HORMONAL BIRTH CONTROL WITHOUT AN OFFICE VISIT. WHOEVER THE SPONSOR OF THIS BILL FOUND THAT IN SOME AREAS THE STATE HEALTH INSURANCE REIMBURSEMENTS FOR THESE TYPES OF TELEHEALTH SERVICE IS LIMITED. THIS BILL CLARIFIES INSURANCE COVERAGE IS AVAILABLE FOR CERTAIN REPRODUCTIVE SERVICES DELIVERED TO TELL HEALTH. POLICY REQUIRES THAT OUR FAMILY PACK PROGRAM TO COVER IT I WITH THAT MEMBERS I RESPECTFULLY ASK THAT I WOULD HAVE INTERVIEWS HERE LIKE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT THE MEASURE [inaudible] GO AHEAD. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS AMY MORE AND I'M VICE PRESIDENT OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS AT ESSENTIAL ACCESS HEALTH. AND ESSENTIAL ACCESS IS PROUD TO SPONSOR SB. TEN TWENTY THREE THIS BILL I'M AS THE SENATOR MENTIONED SEEKS TO EXPAND ACCESS TO ESSENTIAL SEXUAL AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH SERVICES INCLUDING BIRTH CONTROL AN STD TESTING PREVENTION AND TREATMENT. BY ENHANCING COVERAGE FOR THE SERVICES PROVIDED TO MOBILE HOW TECHNOLOGIES LIKE VIDEO PHONE AND SMARTPHONE APPLICATIONS. WE THANK SENATOR HERNANDEZ FOR HIS LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE AND FOR BEING A CHAMPION FOR WOMEN'S HEALTH ESPECIALLY DURING THESE TIMES. CALIFORNIA HAS SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED UNINTENDED PREGNANCY RATES IN OUR STATE SINCE THE NINETEEN NINETIES THANKS TO POLICY AND PROGRAM INNOVATIONS. THAT HAVE ADVANCE OR AT REDUCE BARRIERS TO ACCESSING REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE BUT DESPITE THIS PROGRESS. IN CALIFORNIA DISPARITIES REMAIN AND ARE UNINTENDED PREGNANCY RATES REMAIN DOUBLE THOSE AND OTHER DEVELOPED COUNTRIES AND STD RATES ARE AT A HISTORIC HIGH. DISPROPORTIONATELY OF BONE. RELATIONS IN OUR STATE AS A AREAS AND I'M LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES STILL FACE BARRIERS IN ACCESSING TIME SENSITIVE SEXUAL AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE. AND WE HAVE MANY SEXUAL REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE DESERT REGIONS THAT EXPERIENCE THE HIGHEST RATES OF UNINTENDED PREGNANCY AND STDS. AND ON WHAT WE NOW WIDESPREAD SMARTPHONE USE OFFERS NEW PATHWAYS FOR EXPANDING ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE. AND IN TURN AN OPPORTUNITY TO IMPROVE PUBLIC HEALTH OUTCOMES AND SAVE PUBLIC RESOURCES. THIS BILL SEEKS TO ELIMINATE BARRIERS AS THE SENATOR MENTIONED BY ALLOWING OUT EXPLICITLY PLANS TO COVER THESE SERVICES DELIVERED TO MOBILE TELEHEALTH AND ALSO REQUIRE FAMILY PACK TO COVER THESE SERVICES. AND IN THESE DAYS -- WITH WOMEN'S AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH UNDER ATTACK AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL WE HAVE TO HEARING CALIFORNIA DO EVERYTHING THAT WE CANNOT ONLY TO HOLD THE LINE. AND PROTECT THE ACCESS THAT CALIFORNIANS HAVE NOW BUT TO KEEP PUSHING FORWARD ALSO WITH NEW POLICY INNOVATIONS IN NEW PATHWAYS TO HEALTH. SO FOR THESE REASONS WE ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SO GOOD AFTERNOON I'M DOCTOR ALLEN HARSH WORDS I AM A BOARD CERTIFIED INTERNIST A FELLOW OF THE SOCIETY FAMILY PLANNING. AND A TENURED PROFESSOR OF MEDICINE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA DAVIS. I'M INTO TWO THOUSAND AND SIXTEEN I WORK WITH OUR STATE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES OFFICE OF FAMILY PLANNING IS THERE SENIOR MEDICAL. CONSULTANT HOWEVER I'M SPEAKING TODAY AS A PRIVATE CITIZEN NOT AS A REPRESENTATIVE OF BY THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES. I'M HERE TODAY TO URGE YOU TO SUPPORT S. B.. TEN TWENTY THREE WHICH IS DESIGNED TO EXPAND THE USE TELEHEALTH FOR THE PROVISION OF FAMILY PLANNING SERVICES. I FIRST BECAME INVOLVED IN TELEHEALTH OVER A DECADE AGO AS FACULTY AT THE UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH MEDICAL CENTER IN PENNSYLVANIA. I WORKED WITH COLLEAGUES TO DEVELOP A PROGRAM WE CALLED YOU VISITS AND IS NOW A PROGRAM CALLED ANYWHERE CARE. THIS PROGRAM OFFERS PATIENTS WITH NON EMERGENCY SYMPTOMS QUALITY CARE ONLINE QUICKLY WITH THE EXPLICIT GOAL OF NOT HAVING TO WAIT. IN AN EMERGENCY ROOM OR A WAITING ROOM OR DEAL WITH PARKING HASSLES. SUCH CONVENIENCE IS REALLY BECOMING THE STANDARD OF CARE AND PRIVATE HEALTH CARE. SUCH PROGRAMS ARE ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT TO MAINTAINING THE HEALTH PEOPLE LIVING IN RURAL AREAS ESPECIALLY DURING SNOWY WINTERS WHEN ROAD CONDITIONS CAN BE HAZARDOUS. OF PARTICULAR RELEVANCE TO TODAY'S CONVERSATION I LED UPMC'S LAUNCH OF A CONTRACEPTIVE YOU VISIT WHICH ALLOWED WOMEN TO REQUEST A PRESCRIPTION FOR HORMONAL CONTRACEPTION. AS WE PREVIOUSLY PUBLISHED IN PEER REVIEW JOURNALS WOMEN WHO USED A CONTRACEPTIVE QUESTIONNAIRE TO SELF SCREEN FOR CONTRAINDICATED INSTALL HARMONIC CONTRACEPTION OR LESS LIKELY THE WOMEN WHO SAW CLINICIAN DURING THE REGULAR OFFICE VISIT. TO RECEIVE INAPPROPRIATE PRESCRIPTIONS MEANING USING TELEHEALTH PROVIDE HORMONAL CONTRACEPTION HAS BEEN PROVEN TO BE BOTH SAFE AND EFFECTIVE. MY CURRENT CLINICAL PRACTICE HERE IN SACRAMENTO I GET TO SEE FIRSTHAND THE WAYS ACCESS TO TELEHEALTH IMPROVE MY PATIENTS LIVES. I TAKE CARE OF A GOOD NUMBER OF PATIENTS WHO LIVE A COUPLE HOURS NORTH OF SACRAMENTO. FOR THOSE LIVING IN RURAL AREAS AND PARTICULARLY THOSE WITHOUT GAS MONEY TO DRIVE TO A CLINIC RIGHT NOW. THE OPTION OF TELEHEALTH IS A GOD SO. ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO WORK NIGHTS OFTEN FIND IT HARD TO GET TO CLINIC DURING USUAL BUSINESS HOURS. IN ALL OF THE SITUATIONS THE OPTION OF USING TELE HEALTH TO DISCUSS CONCERNS BUT ABOUT POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS ROUTINE REFILLS WHEN NEEDED CAN MEAN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN. DISEASE AND HEALTH FOR ALL THESE REASONS I STRONGLY ENCOURAGE YOU TO HELP THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA EXPAND THEIR USE OF TELEHEALTH TO EXPAND ACCESS TO PUBLICLY FUNDED FAMILY PLANNING SERVICES. THANKS VERY MUCH DOCTOR OTHER IS IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN FIRST MEGAN SUPERS ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA HEALTH PLUS ADVOCATES IN SUPPORT THANK YOU.

ACTOR CURRY. ANCHOR CURRY I BIGELOW. BIGELOW AYE BONTA. BURKE. CARILLO. CARILLO AYE FLORA [inaudible] LIMON [inaudible] MCCARTY [inaudible] NAZARIAN. RODRIGUEZ SANTIAGO BERMAN WALDRON. HERE FOR WE NEED SOME MORE VOTES YOU MISSED IT THERE WHERE WE HAD ENOUGH VOTES HERE WHILE MY EYES IS AMAZING SURE I'M SURE THEY DON'T NAY BARRACKS CINNAMON. SO ANYWAY YEARS YOUR NEXT BILL SENATE YEAH SP ONE ONE ZERO EIGHT PERFECT THINKING. THINGS CHAIR MEMBERS IN JANUARY AS WE KNOW THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ANNOUNCED A DRAMATIC CHANGE IN POLICY BY ALLOWING STATES TO CONDITION. MEDICAID COVERAGE AND WORK AND COMMUTING GAUGE MEN FOR CERTAIN BENEFICIARIES THE UNDERLYING THEORY BEHIND REQUIREMENTS IS THAT INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE NOT WORKING CHOOSE NOT TO BE EMPLOYED -- BUT THERE ARE MAJOR FLAWS IN THIS STINKING FIRST OFF MEDICAID BENEFICIARIES WHO CAN WORK. DO WORK SECOND IMPOSING WORKERS LAWSON COVERAGE FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE ACTUALLY IN NEED OF COVERAGE TO WORK OR PEOPLE WHO CAN'T WORK BECAUSE THERE. HAVE FAMILY CAREGIVERS OR IN FULL TIME STUDENTS FINALLY A WORK REQUIREMENT WILL LEAD TO AN OVERLY BURDENSOME PAPERWORK AND RESULT IN HIGHER STATE AND COUNTY ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS. CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN A LEADER IN IMPLEMENTATION INLAND TAMING THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. ENCOURAGING ENROLLMENT IN COVERAGE MAKING MEDI CAL CONTINGENT OUR WORK REQUIREMENTS IS A STEP BACKWARDS MEMBERS. THIS BILL PUTS CALIFORNIA RECORD IS REJECTING MISGUIDED AND MEAN SPIRITED ATTEMPTS TO MAKE TAKE MEDICARE COVERAGE AWAY FROM THOSE WHO NEED IT MOST. AYE ASPIRIN AYE VOTE AND I HAVE INDIVIDUALS HERE LIKE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THE MEASURE MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS. GOOD AFTERNOON I'M CHEN FLOYD FROM THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY AND ARE PROUD TO SPONSOR S. B. ELEVEN AWAY. WHEN CONGRESS FAILED TO REPEAL THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT LAST YEAR THE FEDERAL MEDICAID AGENCY BEGAN ADVISING STATES ON CHANGES THEY COULD MAKE TO REDUCE ENROLLMENT IN THEIR STATE MEDICAID PROGRAMS? FOUR STATES ALREADY HAVE WAIVERS REAP APPROVED WITH WORK REQUIREMENTS FOR ADULTS WHO ARE NOT ELDERLY OR DISABLED WELL EIGHT MORE HAVE PENDING APPLICATIONS. THREE OF THOSE APPROVED WAIVERS ALSO INCLUDE A LOCK OUT PERIOD THAT BARS AN INDIVIDUAL FROM RECEIVING MEDICAID COVERAGE SEVERAL MONTHS -- FOR FAILING TO TURN IN PAPERWORK PAY PREMIUMS OR MEET THOSE WORK REQUIREMENTS. STATES ALSO OF A NUMBER OF OTHER REQUESTS AND PENDING WAIVER APPLICATIONS TO RESTRICT ELIGIBILITY SUCH AS TOTAL ENROLLMENT CAPS TIME LIMITS LOWERING OF THE INCOME ELIGIBILITY THRESHOLD AND REINTRODUCTION OF THE ASSETS TEST. IT'S NOT YET KNOWN HOW MANY OF THESE REQUESTS WILL BE APPROVED. WE RECOGNIZE THESE ATTEMPTS FOR WHAT THEY ARE A RETURN TO THE IDEA THAT SO SOME LOW INCOME PEOPLE ARE MORE DESERVING OF HEALTH CARE THAN OTHERS. PRIOR TO OUR MEDI CAL EXPANSION MANY PEOPLE WHO NEEDED HEALTH CARE OFTEN HAD TO WAIT UNTIL THEIR HEALTH HAD DETERIORATED TO THE POINT THAT THEY WOULD BECOME ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICARE ALL. ON THE BASIS OF A DISABILITY. IN OTHER WORDS LOW INCOME PEOPLE HAD TO BECOME MEDICALLY UNABLE TO WORK IN ORDER TO GET THE NEEDED HEALTH SERVICES. THAT WOULD ALLOW THEM TO WORK THIS IS NOT GOOD HEALTH POLICY. FURTHERMORE WE HAVE LEARNED IN CALIFORNIA THAT ANY PAPERWORK REQUIREMENTS BECAUSE ELIGIBLE PEOPLE TO LOSE COVERAGE. AS A RESULT WE HAVE TAKEN THE STEPS TO REDUCE SUCH REQUIREMENTS IN OTHER WORDS WORK REQUIREMENTS WILL CAUSE WORKING PEOPLE TO LOSE COVERAGE FOR FAILURE TO CERTIFY REGULARLY THAT THEY ARE INDEED WORKING. THE VAST MAJORITY OF MEDI CAL BENEFICIARIES WHO ARE NOT HELD EARLIER DISABLED ARE IN WORKING FAMILIES AS A SENATOR MENTIONS. THOSE WHO DO NOT WORK HAVE LEGITIMATE REASONS CHRONIC ILLNESS FAMILY CAREGIVING RESPONSIBILITIES FULL TIME SCHOOL OR WORK IS SIMPLY NOT AVAILABLE TO THEM. SIMILARLY RESTRICTIONS ON WHEN AND HOW LONG A PERSON MAY ACCESS MEDICAID DENIES IN HUMANITY OF WITHHOLDING NEEDED HEALTH CARE FOR BUREAUCRATIC PURPOSES. WELL IT MAY BE THAT NO ONE IN OUR CURRENT ADMINISTRATION EXPECTS IMPOSE NEW RESTRICTIONS ON ELIGIBILITY LEGISLATION MUST BE CONSIDERED NOT ON BEST INTENTIONS BUT I'M POTENTIAL CONSEQUENCES. SHOULD OUR ADMINISTRATION CHANGES SHOULD THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SEEK TO IMPOSE SUCH REQUIREMENTS ON AN EXISTING WAIVER APPLICATION WE WILL NEED THE PROTECTION OF A STATE STATUTE THAT REQUIRES LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT. PRIOR TO REDUCING ELIGIBILITY FOR MEDICAL. FOR THESE REASONS WE'RE PROUD TO SPONSOR SB ELEVEN AWAIT WE THINK THE AUTHOR PURRS LEADERSHIP AND RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR AYE VOTE AND NOW I HAVE MY COLLEAGUE LIES ATTENTION ON FROM LEGAL SERVICES IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA TO GIVE YOU SOME. EXAMPLES OF SOME MEDICARE RECIPIENTS THAT WOULD BE HARMED BY SUCH REQUIREMENTS MOVE THE BILL. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN THERE'S MY NAME IS LIES ATTENTION ON A MANAGING ATTORNEY AT LEGAL SERVICES OF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA OUR OFFICE PROVIDES DIRECT LEGAL SERVICES TO HELP CONSUMERS IN THIRTY TWO NORTHERN CALIFORNIA COUNTIES. WE BELIEVE WORK REQUIREMENTS AS A CONDITION OF MEDI CAL ELIGIBILITY WOULD HAVE A VERY DETRIMENTAL EFFECT ON OUR LOW INCOME CLIENTS. FOR SO MANY OF THEM ACCESS TO NECESSARY HEALTHCARE SERVICES TO THE MEDICARE PROGRAM IS ESSENTIAL TO BEING ABLE TO EVENTUALLY REJOINED THE WORK FORCE. ONE OF OUR RECENT CLIENTS AS A FIFTY SEVEN YEAR OLD MAN A FATHER OF TWO HERE IN SACRAMENTO HE USUALLY WORKS AS AN INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR BUT INJURED HIS BACK THIS AS FAR AND SUBSEQUENTLY HAD TWO HEART ATTACKS. I HE WAS UNABLE TO WORK DURING THIS TIME PERIOD IN COULD NOT HAVE COMPLIED WITH WORK REQUIREMENTS HOWEVER SINCE HE'S HAD CONSISTENT ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE SERVICES TO MEDI CAL HE'S RECOVERING WELL AND GOING BACK TO WORK. ANOTHER CLIENT WE HAD WAS A THIRTY SEVEN YEAR OLD SINGLE MOM WITH THREE KIDS FROM SHASTA COUNTY SHE WAS WORKING AS A REGISTERED NURSE AND HER THIRTEEN YEAR OLD DAUGHTER. BEGIN HAVING SEIZURES DURING WHICH SHE WOULD SOIL HERSELF EXPERIENCE INTENSE PAIN IN ONE SIDE. HER DOCTOR SUSPECTED SHE MIGHT HAVE A BRAIN TUMOR BEGAN SENDING HER TO SPECIALIST APPOINTMENTS HERE IN SACRAMENTO SOMETIMES UP TO THREE TIMES A MONTH. HIS MOM HAD TO QUIT HER NURSING JOB TO CARE FOR HER DAUGHTER AND TO ACCOMMODATE THE FREQUENT TRIPS TO SACRAMENTO. IF WORK REQUIREMENTS WE IMPLEMENTED AS A CONDITION OF MEDI CAL ELIGIBILITY THIS WOMAN WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO COMPLY IT WOULD HAVE BEEN WITHOUT ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE SERVICES HERSELF. MANY THE PEOPLE IN THE MEDICAL EXPANSION POPULATION ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE DISABILITIES AND CANNOT WORK IN OUR AWAITING A DISABILITY DETERMINATION IN THE DAYS BEFORE THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. GETTING A PROPER DISABILITY DETERMINATION TO GET ON TO MDI CAL COULD TAKE MONTHS I HAD ONE CLIENT COULD ADVANCE RECTAL CANCER AS WELL AS MAJOR DEPRESSION. BUT HIS DISABILITY DETERMINATION WAS STILL DENIED THAT DENIAL WAS EVENTUALLY OVERTURNED IT TOOK US SEVERAL MONTHS TO APPEAL AND THAT MEANT UNFORTUNATELY WENT WITH THE ACCESS TO MEDICAL DURING THAT TIME. WHILE MOST MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES ARE IN WORKING FAMILIES ARE ALSO MANY PEOPLE WHO ARE UNABLE TO WORK DUE TO MEDICAL CONDITIONS CAREGIVING RESPONSIBILITIES OR DISABILITIES THE IMPLEMENTATION OF WORK REQUIREMENTS IN THE MEDICAL PROGRAM. WOULD LEAVE THESE GROUPS OF PEOPLE WITHOUT NEEDED HELP FOR THESE REASONS WE SUPPORT THE BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OTHERS IN SUPPORT JUST YOUR NAME AND ORGANIZATION PLACE.

IT'S A THREE ONE SO WILL WILL LEFT LEAVE WHO LIVED ON COFFEE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN VERSONIX WHEN IS ESPY ONE ONE FIVE TWO CORRECT. CHAIR MEMBERS -- WE ARE ALL AWARE OF THE GROWING HOMELESS CRISIS IN CALIFORNIA. THIS BILL IS TRYING TO TACKLE JUST ONE ASPECT OF THIS PROBLEM. WHAT HAPPENS WHEN HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS ARE DISCHARGED FROM THE HOSPITAL? I WANT TO BE CLEAR. THAT HOSPITALS ARE NOT THE CAUSE OF THE PROBLEM. AND IN MANY CASES HAVE BEEN DOING ALL THE BILL IS ASKING THEM TO DO AND MORE. BUT THERE HAVE BEEN A NUMBER OF HIGH PROFILE CASES WHERE PATIENTS HAVE BEEN DISCHARGED IN AN UNSAFE MANNER. FEEDBACK FROM HOMELESS SHELTERS MAKES IT CLEAR THAT WE NEED BETTER CAN COORDINATION BETWEEN THE HOSPITALS AND THE HOMELESS SERVICES PROVIDERS. MY STAFF AND SPONSORS BEEN WORKING CLOSELY WITH A HOT SPOT COMMUNITY ADDRESS MANY OF THE CONCERNS AS WE CAN. WITH PRIOR AMENDMENTS EVERY MOVE REQUIREMENTS TO KEEP PATIENTS IN THE HOSPITAL UNTIL DAYLIGHT HOURS OR DURING IN. INCLEMENT WEATHER AND DELETED CHANGES TO THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT LAW AMONGST OTHER THINGS. AS YOU ANALYSIS DESCRIBES I'M OFFERING ADDITIONAL AMENDMENTS TODAY AS WE CONTINUE WORK TO ADDRESS THESE CONCERNS. I MATT HAPPY TO ALSO TAKE ADDITIONAL MEMBERS SUGGESTED IN YOUR ANALYSIS IN COMMENT NUMBER. SEVEN WITH THESE CHANGES I BELIEVE WE'RE VERY MUCH CLOSER TO POSITION WITH THE HOSPITAL AND PHYSICIAN COMMUNITY ALTHOUGH AS ALWAYS WE WILL CONTINUE NEGOTIATE IN GOOD FAITH. I WILL NOTE THAT THE HOSPITAL COMMUNITY CONTINUES TO OBJECT TO LANGUAGE THAT ENSURES THAT THIS BILL DOES NOT PREEMPT LOCAL ORDINANCE OR SETTLEMENTS. ALL ALONG OR INTENT WITH THIS BILL WAS TO SET A FLOOR AND NOT INTERFERE IF LOCAL JURISDICTIONS HAVE THEIR OWN LOCAL ORDINANCES. CITY OF LOS ANGELES FOR EXAMPLE HAS GROWN ANNA AND TAKE PATIENT DUMPING BILL FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS IN THE CITY ATTORNEY OF LOS ANGELES. REQUESTED A LANGUAGE THAT IS IN THIS BILL ENSURE THAT IT DOES NOT INTERFERE WITH OUR EFFORTS IN LOS ANGELES. THIS IS ONE AREA WHERE THE HOSPITALS I WOULD GUESS WE'LL HAVE TO AGREE TO DISAGREE BUT MEMBERS WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK WHEN I'M. Q. WE HAVE TWO WITNESSES THREE MINUTES EACH I SEE. FIVE PEOPLE SO WHAT'S YOUR PLEASURE. YOUR SIX YEAR OKAY OKAY SO TO WITNESSES THREE MINUTES IT TOOK PLACE. A MY NAME IS STEVE WATERS ON THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF FIRST UP COMMUNITIES -- MY ORGANIZATIONAL RAN FOR THE COUNTY OF SACRAMENTO THE WINNER SANCTUARY EMERGENCY SHELTER PROGRAM THE LAST FEW YEARS. I'D LIKE TO SHARE SOME OF THOSE EXPERIENCES FIRST THE PROGRAM IS AN EMERGENCY SHELTER BUT MEANS WE TAKE A HUNDRED PEOPLE PER NIGHT. I AND AND WE WE RUN NIGHTLY FROM APRIL THROUGH NOVEMBER. SO FOR ABOUT A HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE NIGHTS STRAIGHT. IT'S WE HAVE THREE AND TAKE SITES PEOPLE ARE ALLOWED TO WALK UP AND CHECK IN IN THE MID AFTERNOON. WE PROVIDE THEM DINNER SHELTER FOR THE NIGHT. AND THIS SURE WE'VE BROUGHT IN MORE AND MORE HOW COLLABORATIVE PARTNERSHIPS TO BRING IN MEDICAL CARE HOUSING COUNSELING AND OTHER SERVICES. WE THEN TRANSPORT THEM TO A HOSTING CHURCH FOR THE NIGHT. YOU HAVE OVER FORTY CHURCHES IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY THE PARTICIPATED THIS YEAR. THEY USUALLY SLEEP ON THE FLOOR WE GIVE HIM SLEEPING BAGS. WE ALLOW THEM TO BRING ALONG A A BAG OF BELONGINGS [inaudible] I HIM A FEW OF THE OUR CHURCHES HAVE COTS BUT VERY FEW -- THE EXTRA SERVICES WE OUT WE'RE WE WERE ABLE TO HOUSE OVER FIFTY THIS YEAR SO IT'S EXPANDED THE SCOPE OF THE EMERGENCY -- SHELTER. IN TERMS OF THE UNSCHEDULED DROP OFFS THAT WE SAW WE SAW MANY MORE THIS YEAR THAN IN PREVIOUS YEARS. MUCH LARGER PROBLEM FOR SOME REASON ALL SEASON LONG. WE SAW SEVERAL PROF PER WEEK AND IN SOME CASES EVERY DAY OF THE WEEK. REALLY RECEIVE PATIENTS FROM HOSPITALS MENTAL HEALTH FACILITIES AND OTHER AGENCIES PRETTY MUCH IN THAT ORDER HOSPITALS BEING THE ONES WE SEE THE MOST FROM. MY PLACE BECAME VERY SENSITIVE TO ANY TAXI RIVER DRIVER. PLEASE SIR OTHER OFFICIAL VEHICLE DRIVING UP OUT FRONT STARTING TO UNLOAD SOMEBODY ESPECIALLY TO SINCE WE VERY SELDOM WERE CONTACTED AND ADVANCE. I HAVE SUPERVISORS OR REPLACE IT SUPERVISE ALL NIGHT LONG BUT THEY'RE NOT SKILLED HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS -- OF THE SITUATION OF PEOPLE COMING. TO US WITH MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES AND OTHER PHYSICAL ISSUES COULD BE VERY STRESSFUL NOT JUST FROM MY STAFF. BUT FOR THE OTHER PATIENTS OR OTHER CLIENTS WHO WERE TAKING CARE OF ALSO. SEE I'M SHORT ON TIME WHEN YOU SKIP DOWN. WE ESTABLISHED A RELATIONSHIP WITH SEVERAL HOSPITALS. ESPECIALLY AFTER THIS -- TOPIC KEPT THAT THE MEDIA WORK PRIMARILY WITH SUTTER AND KAISER ON THIS UNDERTAKING LEAD. WE ESTABLISHED A LINE OF COMMUNICATION THAT SEEM TO MAKE ALL THE DIFFERENCE IN THE WORLD IN COORDINATING AND CONTROLLING THE OUTCOME. I'D IMPROVES THE CHANCES FOR THE CLIENT TO SUCCEED IF THEY UNDERSTAND WHAT OUR SYSTEM HAS THE CAPABILITY OF PROVIDING IN THE WAY OF CARE. THEY ALSO WORK ARE CLOSELY WITH KAISER IN SOME CASES BRINGING IN CLIENTS THAT NEED OF SPECIAL EQUIPMENT FOR OXYGEN. FIRST A COMMUNITY SUPPORTS SP ELEVEN FIFTY TWO WE BELIEVE THAT HOSPITAL RELEASES SHOULD DROP PATIENTS AT SHELTERS ONLY WITH APPROPRIATE NOTICE IN COORDINATION. WE THINK THE PROTOCOL SHOULD BE IN PLACE IN ADVANCE OF THE PATIENTS ARRIVING. IN CASES WHERE THE PATIENT HAS NO PLACE TO SLEEP AND SIGNIFICANT MENTAL OR CHRONIC HEALTH ISSUES. THEY MUST BE DIRECTED TO APPROPRIATE CARE RATHER THAN AN EMERGENCY SHELTER. AGAIN NOW WE ARE IN SUPPORT OF THIS AND WE THINK THAT WITH THE RIGHT PROCESS SEASON PROTOCOLS HE COULD BE MADE VERY SUCCESSFUL. MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS MARK WINDOWS WITH S. YEAH YOU CALIFORNIA S. B. ELEVEN FIFTY TWO TAKES A FAIR AND APPROPRIATE APPROACH TO ENSURE HOMELESS PATIENTS ARE DISCHARGED WITH DIGNITY. PROPER CARE AND DISCHARGE PLANNING. AS MENTIONED IN THE SENATE COMMITTEE ON HEALTH OF SAN FRANCISCO RESIDENT DOCTOR TESTIFIED HOW HIS HOSPITAL RECOMMENDED DISCHARGING A HOMELESS PATIENT IN THE RAIN WITH PLASTIC BAGS DESPITE THE PATIENT HAVING SEVERE SKIN INFECTIONS. ALSO AFTER SERVING OUR OUR INS IN HOSPITALS MEMBERS REPORTED THAT MOST HOSPITALS DO NOT HAVE A UNIFORM STANDARD IN PLACE. EVEN WITHIN THE SAME HOSPITAL SYSTEM. TO ENSURE HOMELESS PATIENTS ARE DISCHARGED SAFELY WITH RESPECT AND DIGNITY THE BILL SIMPLY CREATES A MINIMUM HUMANE STANDARD FOR HOSPITALS DISCHARGING HOMELESS PATIENTS AND AIMS TO FILL A GAP. IN CURRENT LAW THAT DOES NOT EXPLICITLY OUTLINED STANDARDS WHEN TREATING THIS VULNERABLE POPULATION. THESE TYPES OF STANDARDS PROPOSED ARE ALSO NOT UNPRECEDENTED AS WE HAVE SEEN SIMILAR POLICIES CREATED WITHIN THE VA HOSPITAL SYSTEM. AND THE WHOLE PERSON CARE PILOTS. IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT WHILE SOME HOSPITALS CURRENTLY GO ABOVE THE PROPOSED STANDARDS IN THIS BILL WHEN DISCHARGING PATIENTS MANY IF NOT MOST DO NOT. THE BILL ALSO ENSURE AGAIN ESTATE RIGHT STANDARD FOR ALL HOSPITALS TO FOLLOW. LASTLY SEIU REPRESENTS OVER TEN THOUSAND SOCIAL WORKERS ALONG WITH NUMEROUS ARE AND WHO ARE. DOING THE DISCHARGE PLANNING FOR THESE PATIENTS. THIS MEASURE WOULD FURTHER EMPOWER THEM TO DO WHAT THEY NEED TO DO WHEN DISCHARGING PATIENTS FROM THE HOSPITAL. BOTH SEIU AND SEE PAN HAVE MADE A GOOD FAITH EFFORT TO WORK WITH OPPOSITION TO ADDRESS THEIR CONCERNS. NOTABLY WE TOOK THREE LARGELY SUBSTANTIVE AMENDMENTS TO EASE THE HOSPITAL'S ISSUES ON THE SENATE FLOOR. WE HOPE TO CONTINUE TO HAVE PRODUCTIVE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION AND CALLIE SAP. AND ENSURE THAT THIS MOST VULNERABLE POPULATION RECEIVES THE HIGHEST QUALITY OF CARE AT ALL TIMES THINK YOU. KAREN SAVAGE CALIFORNIA PAN I THINK HELP.

AND I SERVICE THE VICE PRESIDENT FOR RURAL HEALTH CARE AND GOVERNANCE AT THE CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION. AT C. H. A. I HAVE WORKED ON THE ISSUES RELATED TO HOMELESS PATIENT DISCHARGE FOR MANY YEARS. CH A REMAINS SOME LAST AMENDED WE HAVE WORKED DILIGENTLY AS YOU'VE HEARD WITH THE AUTHOR STAFF IN THE BILL'S SPONSORS TO NEGOTIATE REASONABLE REQUIREMENTS IN THE BILL. AND WE THANK THEM FOR THEIR WILLINGNESS AND COMMITMENT IN THAT PROCESS. HAS THE AUTHOR HAS ACKNOWLEDGED HOSPITAL'S DID NOT CREATE THE HOMELESS CRISIS AND WITHOUT ADEQUATE AND APPROPRIATE COMMUNITY RESOURCE AS HOSPITAL'S CANNOT SOLVE THE PROBLEM ALONE. WE REMAIN OPPOSED PRIMARILY DUE TO THE PREEMPTION LANGUAGE IN THE BILL WE BELIEVE IT SETS A CONDITION THAT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO FRACTURE THE WORK WE HAVE CAREFULLY NEGOTIATED. ALLOWING LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO IMPOSE MORE BURDENSOME REQUIREMENTS ON HOSPITALS THAN IT'S REQUIRED UNDER STATE LAW. WILL CREATE A PATCHWORK REGULATORY SYSTEM. ADDITIONALLY THE BILL IGNORES THE RESPONSIBILITY OF OTHER ORGANIZATIONS IN OUR COMMUNITIES TO STEP UP AND PARTNER WITH COMMUNITY HOSPITALS. TO PROVIDE-THOSE SERVICES NEEDED BY THIS VULNERABLE POPULATION. THE HOMELESS CRISIS IS A STATE WIDE PROBLEM TO EFFECT REAL CHANGE WE DO WHAT WE NEED A COMMITMENT BY MANY INCLUDING THE HOSPITAL'S I'D LIKE TO INTRODUCE AMANDA WILKINSON.

SUPPORTING A PATIENT IN ENSURING THE STAY HEALTHY ISN'T JUST ABOUT HELPING THEM FOLLOW MEDICAL ADVICE THAT WE PRESCRIBE. THERE'S SO MUCH MORE THAT'S NEEDED ON THE ROAD TO RECOVERY THE CHALLENGE THAT WE FACE IS IDENTIFYING AND COORDINATING THE APPROPRIATE RESOURCES FOR THESE PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY -- IF WE CAN BETTER ADDRESS THESE CHALLENGES WE HAVE MORE OF AN OPPORTUNITY.

I I DIDN'T KNOW THEN THE OPPOSITION I HEARD CHI TWO ARGUMENTS ONE DOES FROM THAT. IN THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY THAT PERFECT PROVIDERS FARCE CAPACITY AND WORKLOAD ONE AS FAR AS THAT. THE PREEMPTION ISSUE SO I WANTED TO ASK YOU IF YOU TRIP RESPONDED THOSE TUITION SURE I'D BE MORE THAN HAPPY FIRST LET ME JUST. TELL YOU THAT I AGREE AND WHEN YOU SAID TEN YEARS AGO WHEN YOU DID IT WHEN YOU WERE A CITY COUNCIL MEMBER. I BELIEVE IS ROUGHLY AROUND TEN YEARS ARE ELEVEN YEARS AGO WHEN I WAS ELECTED TO THE STATE ASSEMBLY ACTUALLY SAT IN THIS COMMITTEE AND SENATOR STUDIO AT THE TIME HAD ONE VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT I THINK. LA HAS RIGHT NOW TO THIS PROBLEM HAS BEEN AROUND FOR AWHILE. WITH REGARD TO THE PREEMPTION AS I MENTION [inaudible] FLOOR. AND NOT THE CEILING. AND LET'S SAY THAT WE AGREE TO DISAGREE ON THIS BILL THAT EITHER DOESN'T GET SIGNED OR IF IT. IT DOESN'T AFFORD AFTER THIS COMMITTEE. THIRTY SET AT A HIGHER LEVEL IN THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES SO IT IS ALREADY THERE I DON'T WANNA -- CHANGE WHAT IS ALREADY KIND OF IN STATUTE. WITH REGARD TO THE NOT PATIENT CARE AREA I MEAN WE'RE MORE THAN WILLING TO TALK TO YOU KNOW THE E. OURS OF THE HOSPITALS BUT PROMISED NOT EVERY HOSPITAL HAS. NINE PATIENT CARE AREAS SO. YES BY ALL MEANS ARE WILLING TO CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION SO THAT'S WHY WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO PUT THAT INTO THE BILL AT THIS TIME [inaudible] THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE YOUR MOTION. THERE IS NO MOHAMMED ABOUT. MOTION ON OF MY MR MCCARTY A SECOND BY MATTEL YEAR CURRY -- I JUST A QUESTION OF THE HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION -- DO YOU. I'M FOR GOING TO PLUG THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD IS OBVIOUSLY. HEARING FROM MR MCCARTY NOW HE'S WHERE HE DID TEN YEARS AGO THIS THIS PROBLEMS GET ANY BETTER ACTUALLY I WOULD ARGUE IS ACTUALLY GETTING WORSE. AND SO YOU FEW SAID WE NEED RESOURCES WHATEVER. BUT I DON'T HEAR SOLUTIONS ARE ALTERNATIVES DO YOU HAVE AN ALTERNATIVE FOR A SOLUTION THAT YOU COULD OFFER HERE BECAUSE I'M NOT ON THE HEARING THAT I'M JUST HEARING. WE CAN'T DO IT. WELL WE THINK THAT WE HAVE WORKED DILIGENTLY WITH THE AUTHORS OFFICE AND THE BILL'S SPONSORS TO TRY TO COME UP WITH THE FAULT THE INTENT OF THE BILL WHICH IS TO CREATE A HOMELESS PATIENT DISCHARGE POLICY OUR HOSPITALS WORK UNDER DISCHARGED POLICIES AND WE HAVE AGREED. THAT THIS IS A UNIQUE ENOUGH PROBLEM THAT ISN'T GOING AWAY THAT SEEMS TO BE GROWING THAT WE NEED TO CREATE THAT HOMELESS. PATIENT DISCHARGE POLICY I THINK AMANDA CAN CAN SPEAK TO JUST HOW GRAVE THE ISSUE HAS BECOME AND SOME OF OUR HOSPITALS -- WHAT WHAT WE ARE SAYING IS THAT IN ORDER FOR HOSPITALS TO CONTINUE TO DO THE WORK THAT THEY'RE DOING AND AMANDA DOES THIS WORK EVERYDAY IN HER HOSPITAL? WE NEED MORE RESOURCES FUNDED AND APPROPRIATE IN THE COMMUNITY TO HELP US WHEN WE'RE READY TO DISCHARGE THAT PERSON WHO NEEDS RESPITE CARE OR TEMPORARY SHELTER OR EVEN A PATHWAY TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THAT SOMETHING HOSPITALS ARE WILLING AND ARE CURRENTLY TRYING TO DO BUT WE NEED ADDITIONAL RESOURCES IN THE COMMUNITY AND WE THINK THAT THE BILL -- WOULD WOULD SHOULD CALL OUT THAT MEET. I ONE OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE SEE AS THE BEST JOB THAT WE COULD POSSIBLY DO EVERYDAY IS TO SET UP A GREAT RESOURCE LIST AND GET SOME CONNECTIONS AND PROVIDE A WARM HAND OFF TO AGENCIES. WHERE WE THINK WE'RE FACILITATING THE BEST CASE SCENARIO PLAN FOR THE PATIENT PROVIDING MADS PROVIDING EQUIPMENT -- THE TRANSPORTATION. THE CHALLENGES WHEN YOU HAVE A PATIENT WHO MAY HAVE A HISTORY OF TRAUMA OR INSTITUTIONALIZATION. AND WE RUN INTO -- PATIENTS THAT LEAVE BEFORE WE CAN COMPLETE THE PLAN -- AND THOSE ARE THOSE ARE GREAT CHALLENGE. TWO NAVY WHERE IF WE HAD SOMEONE ON THE RECEIVING END IN THE COMMUNITY WHERE WE CAN PARTNER. IN CENTRAL ISAM SUPPORT OUT IN THE COMMUNITY WITH EITHER SHELTER AGENCIES OR COUNTY AGENCIES. THERE THERE ARE -- MOMENTS THAT SOMETIMES WE JUST SIMPLY CAN'T CAPTURE IN THE HOSPITAL. AND SO THAT IS THAT IS ONE OF THE AREAS WHERE I COULD SEE A SOLUTION HAPPENING IS HOSPITALS COLLABORATING. IN THE COMMUNITY. AFTER THE DISCHARGED OR EVEN ONCE A PATIENT YOU KNOW IF THEY LEAVE IN THE MIDDLE OF A DISCHARGE PLAN -- SO WE COULD FOSTER SOME SUCCESS. I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE SEE AS A BARRIER MOST OFTEN. IT WASN'T THERE PROGRAM AT SOME POINT WHERE HOSPITAL'S REXY DOING CHARITY CARE AND COMMUNITIES. WELL I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF VARIATIONS ON THAT THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND AT CURRENT CURRENTLY IN CHICO WE DON'T HAVE ANY A PROGRAM LIKE THAT AND SO BUT I THINK THERE ARE DIFFERENT. HOSPITALS ARE DOING DIFFERENT PROGRAMS THAT ARE MEETING DIFFERENT NEEDS FOR HOUSING AND STUFF LIKE THAT -- ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. CNN WHICH I TO CLOSE TALK YES I'M SURE I WOULD LIKE TO ARM YOU KNOW. SINCE I GOT ELECTED IN TWO THOUSAND SIX UP UNTIL NOW. WHEN I INTERACT WITH IT WAS IN THE ASSEMBLY OR MY SENATE DISTRICT? THERE IS A INCREASE OF HOMELESSNESS WITHIN OUR COMMUNITIES WE SEE IT. AND IT SPILLING OVER INTO OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM HOSPITAL'S EMERGENCY ROOMS ETCETERA. LET ME JUST REITERATE LIKE A SEMI OPEN STATEMENTS. THE HOSPITALS ARE DOING AN INCREDIBLE JOB AND THEY'RE DOING EVERYTHING THEY CAN BUT THERE ARE STILL INSTANCES WHERE YOU HAVE SOMEBODY IT'S LEFT IN THE STREET WITH THEIR HOSPITAL GOWN AN IV IN THERE. THIS IS NOT HUMANE THIS IS WEIRD THIS IS NOT WHAT THIS COUNTRY'S ABOUT WHAT CALIFORNIA'S ABOUT. AND I KNOW WHEN I STARTED TO SIT THERE WOULD BE SOME CONCERNS BUT WE'VE SCALED US BACK WAY WAY BACK TO WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION I MEAN LET ME ALSO STATE OF WITH REGARD TO WHAT. THE THE COMMENT THAT THE DEMAND THE OPPOSITION. THAT YES THE AGREE WITH THE DISCHARGE POLICY WHICH IS IN THIS BILL WHICH WE ARE GOING TO HAVE. YES WE DO NEED MORE RESOURCE AREN'T ENOUGH RESOURCES HERE'S WHAT I DID DO IN THIS BILL. OTHER ME REPHRASE THAT WHAT I DIDN'T DO IN THIS BILL THAT WAS IN THE STUDIO BILL WHEN I WAS IN IN THE ASSEMBLY. SEE IT'S A DEAL BILL HAD EXTENSIVE PENALTIES. IF THE HOSPITAL'S DIDN'T ABIDE. AND I DON'T MEAN LIKE I RECALL I DON'T THINK I VOTED FOR THE BILL JUST BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO PUT A A PENALTY IN THE HOSPITAL SO THIS. BILL HAS NO PENALTIES WHATSOEVER IT'S A BILL DESIGNED TO BE ABLE TO WORK. THE HOSPITAL'S. WITH THE COMMUNITIES AND THE AVAILABLE RESOURCES WE HAVE OUT THERE AND I I REALLY BELIEVE WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING TO THE ABSOLUTE MORAL PATIENTS AND WITH THAT MEMBERS ARE RESPECT LASSEN I'VE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH DOCTOR NAN AS FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD -- THE BILL HAS A DO PASS RECOMMENDATION WE HAVE A MOTION BY MISTER AGUILAR CURRY A SECOND FIVE MR MCCARTY.

WITH UNCERTAINTIES CREATED IN THIS CURRENT FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION PREMIUMS ARE TO SPEED IT GO UP BETWEEN TWELVE AND 32%. I HAVE AUTHOR OTHER BILLS INTENDED TO KEEP CALIFORNIA'S HEALTH INSURANCE MARKETS STABLE. BUT I KNOW YOU AGREE THAT WE CAN DO MORE TO MAKE INSURANCE MORE AFFORDABLE IN CALIFORNIA BY CREATING SUBSIDIES FOR THOSE WHO CAN'T CURRENTLY. OR ELIGIBLE FOR FEDERAL ASSISTANCE AND HELP LOWER THE INCOME. OF PEOPLE WHO ARE ELIGIBLE FOR FEDERAL SUBSIDIES FOR PROVIDING MORE HELP THROUGH STATE SUBSIDIES. THERE ARE FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND WHO DON'T QUALIFY FOR THE FEDERAL COURT ARE -- ECA SUBSIDIES ARE ANOTHER -- CALIFORNIA'S WHO DO QUALIFY BUT REMAIN UNSURE BECAUSE PREMIUMS ARE STILL HIGH AND WITH THAT MEMBERS I RESPECTFULLY ASK WHEN I'M ON VERY MUCH [inaudible] WITNESSES. BEST PAL ON BEHALF OF HEALTH ACCESS CALIFORNIA PLEASED TO BE HERE IN SUPPORT OF THE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE KNOW. BILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS HAVE BENEFITTED FROM THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT BUT WE HAVE MORE TO DO TO MAKE COVERAGE AFFORDABLE.

WHETHER TO MARRIED COUPLE IN THEIR EARLY SIXTIES IN YOUR DISTRICT MISTER CHAREST PAYING NINETEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR COVERAGE WITH THE SIX THOUSAND DOLLAR DEDUCTIBLE. AND HOW THEY AFFORD THAT ON SIXTY FIVE OR SEVENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS I HAVE NO IDEA. OR SOMEBODY TRYING TO LIVE ON EIGHTEEN OR TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS BEING ASKED TO SPEND THREE OR 4% OF THEIR INCOME FOR PREMIUMS.

TO GET COVERED THROUGH THE EXISTING COVERAGE AVAILABLE TO HIM AND THAT'S JUST NOT AFFORDABLE TO SOME PEOPLE AND MOST OF THE STATE NOT ON THE BORDERS DOES NOT HAVE THE OPTION TO GO TO MEXICO TO GET THEIR HEALTH CARE.

SOME HEALTH PROVIDERS ARE AWARE THAT THERE ARE DIFFERENT MEDICAL NECESSITY STANDARDS FOR ADULTS AND CHILDREN. FOR HEALTH PROVIDERS WHO ARE WHO ARE INFORMED MANY DO NOT KNOW THAT THEY MUST EXPLICITLY REQUEST THIS BROADER EPS DE T. STANDARD.

YOU ON TO SOME OTHER BILLS FOREST [inaudible] SENATOR STONE. WE'RE HAPPY TO HAPPY TO ENTERTAIN YOU APPEAR PLEASE. PRETTY CHAIR ON WILL MEMBERS. I APPLAUD YOU FOR YOUR OF YOUR YOUR INSURANCE TODAY. AS I'M RUNNING UP AND DOWN THE STAIRS TODAY PROCESS EARLY READY TALKING ABOUT. MISTER CHAIR FELLOW MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ON PRESENTING S. B. TWELVE FIFTY FOUR WHICH REQUIRE A PHARMACIST AT A HOSPITAL PHARMACY TO CONFIRM. AN ACCURATE PATIENT MEDICATION PROFILE FOR EACH HIGH RISK PATIENTS UPON ADMISSION. OF THAT PATIENT. I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE CHAIR AND THE COMMITTEE FOR WORKING WITH US ON S. B. TWELVE FIFTY FOUR AND I'M HAPPY TO BE TAKEN THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS TODAY. IT'S STARTLING COLLEAGUES AT UP ON THEIR MEDICATION LESS UPON ADMISSION TO HOSPITAL NOT 259%. OF THESE AREAS HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO CAUSE MODERATE TO SEVERE HARM. THANK YOU SIR THERE IS CURRENTLY A LACK. OF OVERSIGHT FOR ENSURING SUCH MEDICAL LISTS ARE ACCURATE A PUNDIT HOSPITAL ADMISSION. THIS LACK OF DEFINED RESPONSIBILITY RESULTS AND HERE'S IN THE LESS ANY ERRORS IN THE MEDICATION ORDERS WHEN PATIENTS ARE IN THE HOSPITAL AND FACT WHEN THEIR DISCHARGE. NOT ONLY DOES THIS LEAD TO SIGNIFICANT HARM TO THE PATIENT BUT STUDIES HAVE SHOWN. THAT THIS PROBLEM ALSO COST BILLIONS OF DOLLARS DUE TO MEDICATION RELATED READMISSIONS. AND ADVERSE DRUG EVENTS THIS BILL WILL BETTER ENSURE THE ACCURACY OF WHAT A PATIENT MEDICATION PROFILE IS AN ADMISSION. THEREBY POTENTIALLY STOPPING ANY ERRORS WHICH WILL ENHANCE PATIENT SAFETY AND REDUCE POSITION. AND HOSPITAL LIABILITY INCLUDING AFTER THE PATIENTS DISCHARGE I WOULD LIKE TO INTRODUCE DOCTOR RIEDERS CHANGING PHARMACY OFFICER PROFESSOR OF MEDICINE. FOR CEDAR SINAI AN ASSISTANT DEAN OF CLINICAL PHARMACY AT UCSF. THEY APPEAR ON BOTH CENTER STONE AND THANK YOU TO THAT -- TO THAT. FAMILY COMMITTEE ON HEALTH -- COMMUNITY SHARE A PERSONAL STORY AND AND AND FROM MY PROFESSIONAL PERSPECTIVE HAVING BEEN. A PHARMACIST FOR MANY MANY YEARS AND DO IT VERY QUICKLY -- FROM A PERSONAL PERSPECTIVE ABOUT TWENTY YEARS AGO ACTUALLY LAST MONTH MY FATHER WAS DIAGNOSED WITH A BRAIN TUMOR FROM MY METASTATIC LUNG CANCER. WHEN HE WAS DISCHARGED FROM HOT ONE HAAS I NOTICED THAT THEY DISCONTINUED ONE OF THE MEDICATIONS THAT WAS TO REDUCE THE SWELLING IN HIS BRAIN? I AND SO I HAD TO MAKE SURE THAT GOT TAKEN CARE WHEN HE WAS READMITTED TO THE HOSPITAL OR OTHER MEDICATIONS THAT WERE -- UNDEAD I SWEAR THEN THAT IT WOULD MAKE IT MY HEART CAREER GOAL TO TO FIX THIS SOMEHOW. MORE RECENTLY MY NINETY YEAR OLD HAND WAS HOSPITALIZED I WAS I WAS TAKING CARE OF HER. AND UPON ADMISSION -- THEY DISCONTINUED HER HER MATS FOR HER BREAST CANCER THEY WERE ALSO DISCONTINUED SUBSEQUENTLY AND THEN SHE WAS. START ON MULTIPLE -- BLOOD PRESSURE MEDS SHE WAS NINETY POUNDS SHE WAS ADMITTED FALLS AND I NEEDED TO CORRECT A MEDALIST. PERFECT PROFESSIONAL PERSPECTIVE I'VE ALWAYS BELIEVED THAT THE BEST CARE IS PROVIDED WHEN THE HEALTH CARE TEAM WORKS TOGETHER. PHYSICIANS AND NURSES ARE INTENT ON STABILIZING THE PATIENT AT THE TIME OF ADMISSION TO MAKE SURE WHATEVER CONDITION ARE BEING ADMITTED FOREST IS TAKEN CARE OF PHARMACISTS ARE TRAINED TO UNDERSTAND MEDICATIONS AND HOW THEY'RE USED IN THAT EVERY MEDICATION ORDER HOUSE TO BE A COMPLETE SENTENCE JUST AS WE SPEAK. IN ENGLISH SO WE'VE CONDUCTED A RESEARCH STUDY THAT WAS PUBLISHED IN THE PEER REVIEWED LITERATURE ALONG WITH MANY OTHER ORGANIZATIONS IN OUR STUDY WE FOUND THAT. PHARMACY STAFF TO COMMIT THAT TOOK A MEDICATION RISK. LEST I RESULTED IN 80% REDUCTION IN MEDICATION ERRORS HAD THOSE THERE IS NOT BEEN CORRECTED TO STUDY DEMONSTRATED THAT THERE WOULD HAVE AN AVERAGE OF THREE AREAS PER PATIENT. OF WHICH ONE POINT TWO WOULD HAVE IN YRIA SERIOUS OR LIFE THREATENING THIS WAS DONE BY PHYSICIAN PERRY VIEW OF THE OF THE AREAS THEMSELVES TO DEMONSTRATE THE POTENTIAL HARM. THE ISSUE IS THE MEDICATION LISTS ARE ARE OBTAINED BY RIGHT OF INDIVIDUALS AND DIFFERENT HEALTH CARE SETTINGS WHEN ONE GOES TO A DOCTOR'S OFFICE IS OFTEN A MEDICAL ASSISTANT. GIVEN THE COMPLEXITY OF MEDICATIONS THAT I'M GOING RELEASE OF NEW MEDICATIONS THAT ARE VERY VERY CHALLENGING TO UNDERSTAND THE NUMBER OF PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC DISEASES AS WELL AS THE NUMBER OF PHYSICIANS PATIENTS ARE OFTEN SEEN. THESE LISTS ARE PROBLEM PRONE IN THE POTENTIAL FOR HARM IS REAL FOR THE PURPOSE OF THIS BILL IS TO ENSURE THAT A QUALITY IMPROVEMENT PROCESS WITH PHARMACISTS AND PHARMACY STAFF WERE TRAINED IN THIS AREA. ENSURE THE ACTRESS IN THE MEDALIST WHEN OUR PATIENTS ARE. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE THIS WITH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF THEIR OTHER WITNESSES AND SUPPORT. WE A PARADIGM MAP CALIFORNIA LIFE SCIENCES ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT BECUZ. CONNIE DELGADO WITH A CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT. IF YOU.

GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS PAT WHALEN ELLIS MOST NAPA SEE HERE ON BEHALF OF UNITED NURSES ASSOCIATION ALSO REMOVING OUR OPPOSITION WE DO STILL HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THE FACT THAT THE BILL ALLOWS -- THE GATHERING OF THE MEDICATION PROFILE TO BE DELEGATED TO PHARMACY TECHNICIANS AND WE'RE NOT COMFORTABLE THAT THEY HAVE THE EXPERIENCE -- TO TAKE ACCURATELY BECAUSE OTHER MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS HAVE TO RELY ON THAT DOWN THE LINE -- BUT WE ARE MOVING TO NEUTRAL THANK YOU [inaudible] ANYONE ELSE. SEEING NO ONE WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS THE WORKING COMMITTEE -- IS WAS A OF THANK YOU FOR BRINGING TO GO FORWARD.

WHEN I ASK A A CENTER LABOR WOULD YOU MIND IF WE ASK TALKED OF MISTER ROTH TO TAKE HIS BILL FORGET HIS WEEK SIGNIFICANTLY SHORTER? NO PROBLEM THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATOR ROTH. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR OF HOPE SPRINGS ETERNAL ON THE SHORTER PIECE BUT THANK YOU. I'M ALWAYS HOPEFUL SENATOR. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR FIRST LET ME JUST TO THANK YOU PERSONALLY AND YOUR STAFF FOR MEETING WITH ME AND WITH MY STAFF ON THIS BILL -- TO ATTEMPT TO WORK OUT SOME OF THE ISSUES. OF THE BILL IS -- SIMPLY DESIGNED TO ENSURE THAT PATIENTS HAVE THE RIGHT TO RETRIEVE AND PRESERVE THEIR MEDICAL RECORDS PURCHASE DESTRUCTION IF THE PATIENTS DECIDE TO DO SO. OF THIS PARTICULAR BILL AT THIS POINT IN TIME REQUIRES THAT SPECIFIED HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS SEND A SINGLE NOTICE. VIA EMAIL OR POST. MALE. TO THE PATIENTS LAST KNOWN ADDRESS EMAIL OR POST NOTIFYING THE PATIENT AND HIS OR HER PERSONAL HEALTH CARE RECORD WILL BE DESTROYED IF IT'S GOING TO BE DESTROYED. AND WHEN AND GIVES THE PATIENT T. OPPORTUNITY TO REQUEST A COPY. BEFORE THE RECORDS ARE DESTROYED I JUST WANT TO SAY I RECOGNIZE IS THE ANALYSIS POINTS OUT THAT MEDICAL RECORDS ARE NOT THE PROPERTY OF THE PATIENT. BUT MY PURPOSE IN MOVING THIS BILL WAS TO ENSURE THAT PATIENTS RECEIVE A CLEAR NOTIFICATION. WHEN MEDICAL RECORDS ARE GOING TO BE DESTROYED AND GIVEN AN OPPORTUNITY TO PRESERVE THOSE RECORDS IF THE PATIENT IS OURS TO DO SO? FUTURE OF AN OPPORTUNITY TO REVIEW AT LEAST SOME MOCK UPPER DRAFT AMENDMENTS THAT -- YOUR STAFF HAS PROVIDED TO ME -- THAT PROVIDE A NOTIFICATION. TERM RECORD RETENTION PERIOD AT THE BEGINNING OF THE A HEALTH CARE PROVIDER PATIENT RELATIONSHIP AND AS WE DISCUSSED I HAVE SOME CONCERNS THE PROVIDING. PATIENTS WITH INFORMATION AT THE BEGINNING OF THE DOCTOR PATIENT RELATIONSHIP WHEN THE PATIENT IS FOCUSED ON SECURING MEDICAL TREATMENT OR PAIN RELIEF MAY NOT BE THE MOST EFFECTIVE. NOTIFICATION METHOD TO THE PATIENT -- AS YOU KNOW AND WE DISCUSSED I'M ALSO CONCERNED THAT PROVIDING PATIENTS WITH THE MEDICAL RETENTION PERIOD WHETHER IT'S SEVEN YEARS OR FIVE YEARS. MAY NOT ACTUALLY. TELL THE PATIENT WHEN THOSE RECORDS ARE GOING TO BE DESTROYED AND TRIGGER IN THE PATIENT'S MIND ASSUMING THEY REMEMBER THAT NOTIFICATION. THAT FAR DOWNSTREAM EXACTLY WHEN THEY NEED TO PROVIDE. THE NOTIFICATION TO THE OF MEDICAL -- PROVIDERS OFFICE BUT I ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT THERE CERTAINLY ARE ARGUMENTS ON THE OTHER SIDE AND POINTS TO BE MADE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THIS DISCUSSION. AND SHOULD THIS BILL HAPPEN TO MOVE FORWARD OF FROM THIS COMMITTEE I HAVE PERSONALLY COMMITTED TO WORK WITH YOU AND WORK WITH YOUR STAFF TO TRY TO COME UP WITH A WORKABLE ALTERNATIVE -- ACCEPTABLE TO BOTH OF US -- AGAIN ASSUMING THE BILL HAPPENS TO MOVE OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE AND ASSUMING -- IF IT'S AN APPROPRIATION ISN'T THAT IT SHOULD HAPPEN TO MOVE OUT OF APPROPRIATIONS AND I INTEND TO OF FULLY HONOR THAT COMMITMENT AND AGAIN I WANT TO EXPRESS MY APPRECIATION. TO YOU FOR TAKING YOUR TIME IN THIS BUSY WEEK TO MEET WITH ME ON THE DETAIL OF THE BILL. I HAVE A COUPLE OF FOLKS HERE WHO MAY WANT TO BRIEFLY -- ADDRESS SOME ISSUES MISTER ALLEN BONUS AND AND CHEN FLORI WAS I CAN WESTERN CENTER THINK. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND COMMITTEE. I'M ALAN POINT US PRIVATE CITIZEN FROM LAGUNA BEACH IN SUPPORT. I'VE BEEN WORKING ON RELATED LEGISLATION FOR MORE THAN TWELVE YEARS STEMMING FROM MY WIFE'S PERSONAL BATTLES WITH BREAST CANCER. WE FACE SKINNER DEAL NOT JUST WITH THE DISEASE BUT WITH AN ARCANE SYSTEM OF LAWS THAT ARE CONFUSING AT BEST. SPEAK YOU ASLI BSENT WORST WHEN IT COMES TO PROTECTING PATIENT MEDICAL RECORDS FROM PREMATURE DESTRUCTION. THIS IS WHAT DRIVES ME TO THIS DAY WHAT HAPPENS MY WIFE SHOULD NOT HAPPEN TO ANYONE ELSE. PEOPLE PAY DOCTORS FOR VITAL SERVICE WHICH INCLUDES STORING MEDICAL RECORDS. WELL CURRENT LAW ALLOWS PATIENTS TO ACCESS THEIR MEDICAL RECORDS MOST WOULD BE SHOCKED TO LEARN. DOCTORS ARE FREE TO SHRED PATIENT RECORDS WITH NO OBLIGATION TO INFORM THE PATIENT. IN THE CASE OF CANCER AND OTHER DISEASE. THAT GO INTO REMISSION FOR PERHAPS DECADES TREATMENT PLANS ARE DEPENDENT ON WHAT HAS HAPPENED BEFORE. MY WIFE SUFFERED FROM BREAST CANCER TWICE OVER FOURTEEN YEAR PERIOD. WHEN SHE WAS STRICKEN THE SECOND TIME I TRY TO RETRIEVE HER ORIGINAL TUMOR SLIDES AND RADIATION RECORDS TO LEARN WHETHER HER CANCER WAS NEW OR RECURRENT? AND WHETHER SHE WAS A CANDIDATE FOR MORE RADIATION. BUT THE SLIDES HAD BEEN DESTROYED AND THE RADIATION RECORDS WERE MISSING. IN THE MAD RUSH TO TREAT DOCTORS RECOMMEND MY WIFE BE RADIATED AGAIN. BUT WITHOUT THE RADIATION RECORDS THERE WAS NO WAY OF KNOWING WHETHER SHE HAD REACHED A LIFETIME MAXIMUM OF RADIATION FROM HER FIRST BATTLES WITH CANCER. RADIATION TREATMENT CAN BE BOTH THE QUEUE OR AND CURSE. WITHOUT THE NOTIFICATION REQUIREMENT IN THIS BILL PATIENTS WILL CONTINUE TO BE IN THE DARK. NEVER KNOWING WHETHER THE DOCTOR PATIENT RELATIONSHIP HAS ENDED. OR WHETHER THEIR RECORDS EVEN CONTINUE TO EXIST. KNOWING ONE PATIENT MEDICAL RECORDS MAY BE DESTROYED. IT'S NOT THE SAME AS KNOWING WHEN PATIENT RECORDS WILL BE DESTROYED. IT WAS PURE CHANCE THEN MY WIFE'S TUMOR SLIDES WERE DESTROYED AND RADIATION RECORDS WERE EVENTUALLY FOUND. THE CHANCE IS NOT HOW WE SHOULD BE RUNNING HEALTH CARE IN THIS STATE. AND I HEARD YOUR SUPPORT THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON CHEN FOR ON BEHALF OF WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY. MANY OF THE LOW INCOME PEOPLE THAT WESTERN CENTER AND OUR PARTNERS SERVE HAVE COMPLICATED MEDICAL HISTORIES WHEN MEDICAL RECORDS ON AVAILABLE PROVIDERS CAN MAKE APPROPRIATE TREATMENT DECISIONS BASED ON WHAT'S BEEN TRIED IN THE PAST. ADDITIONALLY MANY PUBLIC BENEFITS PROGRAMS RELY ON MEDICAL RECORDS FOR PROGRAM ELIGIBILITY DETERMINATION SUCH AS ARE SSI PROGRAM MEDI CAL PROGRAMS BASED ON DISABILITY AND CERTAIN VETERANS BENEFITS. OTHER PROGRAMS RELY ON MEDICAL RECORDS TO DETERMINE WHETHER A BENEFICIARY SHOULD BE SUBJECT TO WORK REQUIREMENTS SUCH AS CAL WORKS AND CAL FRESH NOT YET MEDI CAL. AS SUCH WE SPONSORED S. B. FIVE SEVENTY FIVE LAST YEAR TO ENSURE THAT PEOPLE WHO RELY ON THESE RECORDS COULD ACCESS AND FOR FREE WHEN NEEDED FOR VARIOUS PROGRAM DETERMINATIONS. HOWEVER WITHOUT THE PROTECTIONS. A BIT OF PROTECTING THE UNDERLYING MEDICAL RECORDS THE PROTECTIONS IN S. B. FIVE SEVENTY FIVE R. POINTLESS IT YOU KNOW WE'VE WHEN I WAS IN LEGAL SERVICES PREVIOUSLY I HELP MANY PEOPLE WHO WERE TRYING TO PROVE THEIR DISABILITY AND THEY COULD NOT ACTUALLY GET THE RECORDS TO PROVE THAT. DISABILITY BECAUSE THE RECORDS WERE GONE. MEDICAL RECORDS ARE ALSO USED IN A VARIETY OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND CAN HELP DETERMINE WHO HAS CUSTODY OF A CHILD WHETHER COMPANY IS LIABLE FOR HARM OR WHETHER AN EMPLOYEE HAS A CLAIM AGAINST AN EMPLOYER. CONSUMERS MUST BE INFORMED WHEN THEIR MEDICAL RECORDS ARE IN JEOPARDY SO THEY CAN PRESERVE THE DOCUMENTS THAT MAY DICTATE THEIR RIGHTS IN THE FUTURE -- FINALLY IN OUR LOCAL LEGAL SERVICES ADVOCATES SAY ALSO HELP A LOT OF PEOPLE WITH MEDICAL TO AT AND ALL TO SAY THAT MANY PROVIDERS DO GO TO GREAT LENGTHS TO FIND SOMEBODY ONE A BILL IS OWED AND WE WOULD HOPE THAT THEY WOULD GO TO AT LEAST THOSE. SIMILAR LINKS TO FIND SOMEBODY WHEN THEY'RE GOING TO DESTROY THEIR MEDICAL RECORDS I PERSONALLY FOUND OUT WHEN I WAS APPLYING TO LAW SCHOOL AS A YOUNG ADULT THAT ALL OF MY PEDIATRIC RECORDS HAD BEEN DESTROYED. AND LATER IN LIFE IT WAS ACTUALLY THE FACT THAT MY MOM DID HAVE GOOD MEDICAL RECORDS ABOUT HER BREAST CANCER THAT I WAS ABLE TO MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT MY CARE AND MY COUSIN WAS ABLE TO MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT HER. SO FOR THIS WE URGE YOUR AYE VOTE AND WE URGE TO CONTINUE TO WORK TOGETHER TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE BEST NOTIFICATION IS FOR CONSUMERS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OTHERS IN SUPPORT I JUST YOUR NAME AND ORGANIZATION PLEASE. MARY JANE FOR IS HEALTH ACCESS CALIFORNIA IN SUPPORT. THE MIKE MONTGOMERY CONGRESS OF CALIFORNIA SENIORS WHO SUPPORT THE BILL THANK YOU. SARAH FLOCKS CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. TAYLOR DOT SOME OF THE CALIFORNIA NURSES ASSOCIATION IN STRONG SUPPORT. JEFFERSON MOST OF THE MEDICAL BOARDOF CALIFORNIA THE BOARD SUPPORTS THE CONCEPT OF THIS BILL EVEN WORKING WITH AUTHORS OFFICE IN WILL BE BRINGING IT BACK TO OUR BORN JULY THANK YOU. PANCAKES CALIFORNIA ALLIANCE OF TOUGH RETIRED AMERICANS STRONG SUPPORT CALIFORNIA'S DISABILITY RIGHTS IN STRONG SUPPORT. IS ANYONE IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS AMY DUGGAR NOT THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION SEEMAYER REMAINS OPPOSED TO S. B. TWELVE THIRTY EIGHT AND MUST AMENDED TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEMATIC SECOND NOTICE REQUIRED CURRENTLY UNDER THE BELL. WITHIN SIXTY DAYS OF DESTRUCTION OF THE MEDICAL RECORDS TO THE PATIENTS LAST KNOWN MAILING ADDRESS AND EMAIL. THE SECOND NOTICE ASSEMBLY AND WORKABLE AS DRAFTED IN CREATES NUMERO NUMEROUS OPERATIONAL ON PRIVACY CONCERNS IT FUNDAMENTALLY DOES REGARDS AWAY THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM CURRENTLY WORKS AND THAT MANY HEALTH FACILITIES AND HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGES NOW GOVERN RECORD MAINTENANCE ND DESTRUCTION. DEPENDING ON HOW THE HEALTH SYSTEM IS INTEGRATED IN THE ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD SYSTEM USED THIS BILL AS WRITTEN DOES NOT ACKNOWLEDGE THAT INSTEAD PUTS A POSITION IN A POSITION OF HAVING TO COMPLY WITH THE DESTRUCTION NOTICED. THAT THEY DO NOT CONTROL IN MANY INSTANCES. THERE FOR A RAISES OPERATIONAL CONCERNS OF HOW THE NOTICE WOULD WORK FOR PROVIDERS THAT MAY PRACTICE IN MULTIPLE SETTINGS GIVEN THE RECORDS ARE MAINTAINED IN THOSE INTERNAL SYSTEMS AND DO NOT FOLLOW THE PROVIDER. THE HEALTHCARE SETTINGS ARE NOT OBLIGATED UNDER THE BELL YET THE PROVIDERS THAT THE CONTRACT WITH ARE OBLIGATED UNDER THE BELT. IN ADDITION MEDICAL PRIVACY LAWS ENSURE THAT PATIENTS COME ACROSS LIMITATIONS ON COMMUNICATIONS NOW WHEN A PATIENT MAY HAVE BEEN SEEN PERCENT OF MEDICAL SERVICES FOR EXAMPLE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SERVICES ARE REPRODUCTIVE ISSUES. THE BILL WILL REQUIRE AN ACROSS THE BOARD NOTICE TO BE CENTER ADDRESS SHOWING THAT THEY RECEIVE THE SERVICE AS A WITH NO EXCEPTIONS EVEN IF THE PATIENT. THEY ONLY BECAUSE AT A CERTAIN NUMBER. THEY INFORMATION IN THE NOTICE IS CAPTURED AND THE LAWS MEDICAL INFORMATION WHICH MEANS THAT THERE MAY BE A PRIVACY BREACH OF OPEN BY A DIFFERENT INDIVIDUAL. FOR PATIENTS IN DECADES AGO IT IS VERY LIKELY THAT THE CONTACT INFORMATION ON FILE WILL NO LONGER BE ACCURATE THERE FOR THE MAJORITY OF THE NOTICES WILL NOT REACHING THE WRONG INDIVIDUALS. SO THE SECOND US IN THE BOW WE THINK WILL ONLY CREATE CONFUSION AND LITIGATION AND A MASSIVE BURDEN ON MEDICAL PRACTICES THAT YOU MAY HAVE OFFERED AMENDMENTS THAT WE THINK WOULD ADDRESS THESE CONCERNS AND QUESTIONS WHILE ALSO ENSURING PATIENTS ARE AWARE OF THE RETENTION RECORD POLICY. WHICH IS THE UNDERLYING ISSUE -- WE ALSO APPRECIATE THE CHAIR IN THE COMMITTEE'S WORK ON THAT BELL IN THEIR EFFORTS AND WILLINGNESS TO WORK WITH THE OUT THERE AND THE CONCERNS -- BUT WE REMAIN OPPOSED LAST MINUTE AT THIS TIME WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING CONVERSATIONS -- BUT WILL BE CONTAINED US FOR NO VOTE OF THESE ISSUES ARE ADDRESSED IN THE FUTURE THANK YOU. MY NAME IS LIZ ALLAN AND I'M HERE REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH INFORMATION ASSOCIATION. I'D -- THIS ASSOCIATION REPRESENTS -- NINE THOUSAND HEALTH INFORMATION MANAGERS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND PRIMARILY WE ARE THE PEOPLE WHO DEAL WITH THE MEDICAL RECORDS WHEN PATIENTS COME IN REQUEST FOR THEM OR WE WORK WITH THE PRACTITIONERS WHO OWN THE RECORDS AND AND MAKE THEM AVAILABLE TO THE PATIENTS WE STRONGLY SUPPORT PATIENT ACCESS TO THEIR HEALTH INFORMATION AND TO THEIR MEDICAL RECORDS BUT WE CANNOT SUPPORT THIS BILL. ARE IN LESS AMENDMENTS ARE MADE TO IT -- WE SUPPORT THE FACT THAT PATIENTS SHOULD BE INFORMED AT THE TIME THEY ENCOUNTER THEIR PROVIDERS THAT THE LENGTH OF TIME THE PROVIDER WILL KEEP THEIR RECORDS. AND HOW THE PATIENT MAY OBTAIN COPIES OF THOSE RECORDS. BUT THE WAY THAT THIS -- THE BILL WORKS WITH THIS IS NOT REALLY GOING TO WORK IN. IN THE REAL WORLD -- ARE MAJOR CONCERNS ARE THE POTENTIAL BREACHES OF PROTECTED HEALTH INFORMATION BY SENDING LETTERS OR EMAILS TO THE LAST KNOWN ADDRESS OF PATIENTS WHO YOU MAY HAVE NOT SEEN FOR FIVE OR TEN OR FIFTEEN YEARS -- IT TOO AND MAYBE HUNDREDS OF PATIENTS ARE THOUSANDS OF PATIENTS -- THERE'S A LOT OF UNFORESEEN AND POTENTIALLY EXTENSIVE BREACHES OF UP PROTECTED HEALTH INFORMATION. IT'S IN A EXTENSIVE ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN MEDICAL GROUPS WHO MAY ROUTINELY DESTROY. UP TO THIRTY THOUSAND RECORDS A YEAR. ARE OF PATIENTS THAT HAVE BEEN DOT HAVE EXCEEDED THEIR RETENTION POLICIES -- IT'S A LACK OF STANDARDIZED MEDICAL RECORD RETENTION LAWS THAT IS -- UNDERNEATH THAT UNDERLIES ALL THIS. HOSPITALS AND CLINICS MAY HAVE TO OFFER MAY HAVE LAWS THAT. SPECIFY HOW LONG THEY HAVE TO KEEP THE RECORDS INDIVIDUAL PHYSICIAN PRACTITIONERS DO NOT. A HYBRID MEDICAL RECORDS AND ELECTRONIC -- MEDICAL RECORDS AREN'T ISSUE FOR EVERYBODY WERE IT IN ELECTRONIC RECORDS BUT THERE ARE STILL A LOT OF PAPER RECORDS REMAINING SO WHAT IS THE ORIGINAL RECORD THAT WOULD BE GIVEN TO THE PATIENT. SO UNLESS THERE ARE -- AMENDMENTS THAT ADDRESS THESE ISSUES THAT CALIFORNIA HEALTH INFORMATION ASSOCIATION STRONGLY OPPOSES THE BILL. OTHER WITNESSES IS JUST NAME AN ORGANIZATION PLEASE. AS THAT RECORD WITH THE CALIFORNIA DALLAS ASSOCIATION REPRESENTING TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND MEMBER DENNIS WE ARE POSTED ON SOME ENDED. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS TO MATT REPRESENT THE CALIFORNIA SOCIETY OF PLASTIC SURGEONS IN OPPOSITION [inaudible] VERY MUCH ANYONE ELSE. BRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. WITH BIGGER YEAH THANK YOU CENTER OFFERING THIS FOR AND COMMITTEE TO WORK -- TO GET THE IMPLEMENTATION PIECE DOWN THAT THE OPPOSITION DOESN'T APPRECIATE AT THIS POINT. ALL SUPPORT YOUR BILL TODAY AND I LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING THE AMENDMENTS IN THE CHANGES AND HOPEFULLY I CAN VOTE FOR TO GET ON THE FLOOR. THINKING [inaudible] ANYONE ELSE. I DON'T THINK EVER THINK YOU I THINK -- I APPRECIATE OUR CONVERSATION THIS MORNING AS WELL SENATOR I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HAS -- BECOME GLARINGLY CLEAR TO ME IS THAT THERE IS HUGE INCONSISTENCY THROUGHOUT THE MEDICAL PROFESSION AND HOW RECORDS ARE RETAINED. I'M REALLY OLD SCHOOL I KEPT EVERY RECORD FROM EVERY PATIENT EXCEPT THOSE WHO WHO I KNEW HAD TO SEE WERE DECEASED -- IN A PERFECT WORLD I THINK THAT'S THE WAY IT SHOULD BE DONE AND DEATH YOU WOULDN'T HAVE WE WOULDN'T HAVE THIS ISSUE WE'RE ALSO MOVING INTO THE AGE OF ELECTRONIC RECORDS SO STORAGE WILL BE DIFFERENT AND UP POTENTIALLY EASIER TO MAINTAIN. AND IT COULD BE A POINT IN THE NOT TOO DISTANT FUTURE WHERE WE DON'T HAVE THIS ISSUE BECAUSE IT IS ELECTRONIC AND IT'S IN THE CLOUD WHERE THE HECK THAT IS -- BUT BUT YOU KNOW I MEAN JUST JUST JUST LISTEN TO LISTEN TO THE INCONSISTENCY HERE. PROVIDERS TREATING MEDI CAL PATIENTS ARE REQUIRED TO KEEP THEIR RECORDS FOR A MINIMUM OF TEN YEARS. OPTOMETRISTS FOR SEVEN YEARS. DEPARTMENT OF MANAGED HEALTHCARE REQUIRES CONTRACTS BETWEEN HEALTH PLANS AND PROVIDERS WHO REGULARLY FURNISH SERVICES UNDER THE PLANT -- TO REQUIRED PROVIDES RICK MAINTAIN RECORDS FOR TWO YEARS. HMO MEDICAL RECORDS MUST BE RETAINED FOR TWO YEARS. POSITIONS TO DISPENSE OF A SCHEDULE ONE TWO AND FORD OR FOR DRUGS A MUST KEEP RECORDS FOR THREE YEARS. WORKERS COMP GUY CASES PER FIVE YEARS THERE IS HUGE INCONSISTENCY HERE AND I WOULD BET THE YOU COULD PROBABLY ASK. HALF THE PHYSICIANS WOULD GET IT WRONG THEY DON'T KNOW HOW LONG THIS WAS TO KEEP RECORDS. AND SO YOU YEAR THIS IS A MUCH BIGGER ISSUE -- OUT THERE -- AND I APPRECIATE YOU BRINGING THIS FORWARD I THINK WE'VE ACCEPTED OUR FIRST AMENDMENT -- THERE AND I THINK WE'RE WHICH IS THAT WERE CLARIFYING AND TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS TO ALLOW THE NOTIFICATION. OTHER RETENTION -- APPEARED TO APPEAR IN ANOTHER FORM RECEIVING GIVEN SO THAT'S THE EARLY PART S. -- WE'RE STILL TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW THIS THE SECOND THAT WHAT HOW THE SECOND NOTIFICATION WORK TONIGHT COMMITTED. TO TO WORK WITH YOU THROUGH THAT -- IN AYE I AGREE -- I THINK MAINTAINING RECORDS IS IS IMPORTANT ARE FOR PATIENTS AND SO AND WE ALSO BUT NEED TO FIND A WAY TO KEEP PATIENTS INFORMED. AT SOME POINT PATIENTS NEED TO TAKE SOME RESPONSIBILITY -- AS WELL FOR THE THE THE DISPOSITION OF OF THEIR RECORD SO -- SO WE WILL CONTINUE -- TO WORK I WORK WITH YOU ON THIS AND I APPRECIATE THE SPIRIT WHICH YOU COME FORWARD ON TRYING TO SOLVE OF A REAL PROBLEM I THINK I BELIEVE -- AND THAT THIS THIS DOES SO SUPPORT ARE YOU TO HAVE A SUPPORT RECOMMENDATION FOR ME AND AT THIS POINT I WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. WELL LET ME JUST ASSURE THE LOOK FIRST FOR MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU VERY VERY MUCH FOR THOSE COMMENTS AND FOR YOUR HELP EARLIER. LET ME JUST ASSURE THE COMMITTEE THAT THERE IS NO INTENT HERE TO VIOLATE ANYONE'S PRIVACY OR DISCLOSE ANY MEDICAL INFORMATION. AND I I DON'T BELIEVE A A NOTIFICATION IN A IN A EITHER A SHORT LETTER OR AN EMAIL THAT SIMPLY SAYS -- WE HAVE YOUR RECORDS WE'RE GOING TO DESTROY THE MONEY MAY NINETEEN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN IF YOU WANT THEM GIVE US A CALL OR CONTACT US AT HACKS. VIOLATES OUR DISCLOSES ANYONE'S MEDICAL INFORMATION UNDER ANY DEFINITION WHETHER IT'S THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF MEDICAL INFORMATION ACT THAT WE DEAL WITH HERE IN CALIFORNIA. OR OF FEDERAL HIPPA. OF SECONDLY REPRODUCTIVE SERVICES THERE'S NO INTENT HERE TO DISCLOSE THAT SORT OF INFORMATION AND IN FACT THE CLINICS TO PROVIDE THOSE SERVICES. ARE EXEMPT UNDER THE BILL AND OBVIOUSLY I THINK THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS KNOW THAT IT'S THE HEALTH CARE PROVIDER HIMSELF HERSELF FOR ITSELF IN THE CASE OF A GROUP. THAT DECIDES WHETHER MEDICAL RECORDS ARE DESTROYED AFTER THE RETENTION RECORD RETENTION PERIOD -- AND WHEN AND I DO RECOGNIZE THAT THERE MAY BE SOME ADMINISTRATIVE KOSTER INCONVENIENCE IT'S OCCUR INCURRED HERE BY THE HEALTH CARE PROVIDER OR THE GROUP DEPENDING ON THE WAY THE PROVIDER DECIDES TO IMPLEMENT THE PROVISIONS OF THIS PARTICULAR BILL FRANKLY IF THIS BILL PREVENTS AND ON UNNECESSARY PROCEDURE PROVIDES. FOR MORE EFFECTIVE TREATMENT FOR A PATIENT OR IN. AND HOPEFULLY THE RARE CASE SAVES THE LIFE I THINK THOSE ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS OF THAT INCONVENIENCE CERTAINLY ARE WELL WORTH IT. AGAIN I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I APPRECIATE THE COMMITTEE COMMITTEE'S CONSIDERATION -- AND I WOULD CERTAINLY RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. WE HAVE A MOTION [inaudible] MOTION. MUCH MR MCCARTY. SECOND BY MISTER RODRIGUEZ PUT THEM TO SLEEP. I I'M SURE WILL BE AWAKE IN A MOMENT. A TO THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TWO PROBES -- MEMSIC TRIP PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. WOULD I WOULD I MAYES.

RODRIGUEZ AYE SANTIAGO. THURMOND WALTER [inaudible] WILDER KNOW. YOU'RE FIVE VOTES -- WE HAVE SOME MEMBERS MISSING WILL LEAVE THE ROLE WILL LEAVE IT ALONE HALL THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THINK THINK CENTER SENATOR LEYVA THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS TO BEGIN I WOULD LIKE TO THANK YOU AND YOUR COMMITTEE STAFF BEFORE THE TIME USE THAT WORKING WITH ME AND MY STAFF ON THIS BILL. I'M PLEASED TO ACCEPT THE CHAIR'S RECOMMENDATION RECOMMENDED AMENDMENTS THAT SIMPLIFY THE ILL SIGNIFICANTLY. AMONG OTHER THINGS THESE AMENDMENTS REMOVE THE SIXTY DAY NOTICE REQUIREMENT. STIPULATE THAT FINANCIAL ASSISTANT CAN ASSISTANCE CAN BE DISCONTINUED IF A PATIENT DIES OR OBTAINS OTHER HEALTH INSURANCE COVERAGE. PROHIBITS PROVIDERS FROM BALANCE BILLING PATIENTS. REMOVES COMPLICATED REVIEW DETERMINATIONS. IMPOSE ON REGULATORS AND SPECIFIES THE PAYMENT RATE FOR FINANCIALLY INTERESTED ENTITIES. THIS BILL WILL PREVENT PROVIDERS FROM GAMING THE SYSTEM AS A MECHANISM TO ARTIFICIALLY GENERATE THREE TO FOUR TIMES THE MEDICARE REIMBURSEMENT RATE FOR PROVIDING THE EXACT SAME CARE. THIS GAMING OF THE SYSTEM IS HARMFUL AND A COUPLE OF WAYS. IT CAN EXPOSE THE PATIENT TO AN INCREASED SHARE OF COSTS WITH COPAYS AND DEDUCTIBLES AND A COMMERCIAL PLAN. IT PUTS PUTS PATIENTS AT RISK OF LOSING COVERAGE IF THE PROVIDER STOPS MAKING THEIR PAYMENTS. IT DRIVES UP COSTS FOR EVERYONE ELSE BY SHIFTING RISK TO FRAGILE INDIVIDUAL MARKET. S. B. ELEVEN FIFTY SIX PROTECTS LEGITIMATE THIRD PARTY PAYMENT MECHANISMS REMOVES THE INCENTIVE FOR PROVIDERS TO GAME THE SYSTEM AND ESTABLISHES SAFEGUARDS TO HOLD PATIENTS. WHO MAY HAVE INADVERTENTLY BEEN CAUGHT UP IN ONE OF THESE PAYMENT SCHEMES HARMLESS HERE IN SUPPORT WITH ME TODAY? AND YOU ONE FROM THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA HEALTH AND INSURANCE COMPANIES ENGLAND BACCHUS FROM DRUG POLICY ALLIANCE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS AND YOU ONE WITH THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA LIFE AND HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANIES WERE STRONGLY IN SUPPORT OF SB ELEVEN FIFTY SIX WE SEE THIS IS A MODEST. BUT IMPORTANT EFFORT TO ADDRESS THE SITUATION THAT WE'VE SEEN OCCUR IN JUST THE LAST FEW YEARS SINCE THE PASSAGE OF THE ACA. WHAT IS HAPPENING IS THAT SOME PROVIDERS OF TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE GUARANTEED ISSUE ONCE REQUIREMENTS OF THE ACA TO STEER PATIENTS INTO COMMERCIAL HEALTH INSURANCE MARKET? BY OFFERING TO PAY FOR THE PATIENTS PREMIUMS WHEN THE PATIENT MAY BE ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICARE ALLEN MEDICARE. THEY DO THIS BECAUSE IT IS IN THEIR FINANCIAL INTEREST TO DO SO THEY KNOW THEY WILL MAKE MUCH MORE FROM INSURANCE PAYMENTS TO OUTWEIGH THE COST OF THE PREMIUMS. NOW MANY TIMES IS NOT IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE PATIENTS AND CERTAINLY NOT IN THE BEST INTEREST OF INDIVIDUALS AND SMALL GROUPS STRUGGLING TO PAY THEIR PREMIUMS. IN THOSE MARKETS. OTHER THAN A LOT OF PRESS COVERAGE ABOUT AFINANCIALLY INTERESTED OUT OF NETWORK SUBSTANCE ABUSE DISORDER TREATMENT FACILITIES. AND HOW THEIR PRACTICES ARE CAUSING HUGE BILLS FOR INSURERS AND NOT PROVIDING SUBSTANTIVE HELP FOR THE ADDICTED. BUT I BELIEVE MY COLLEAGUE HERE WILL PROVIDE MORE DETAIL ABOUT THAT PRACTICE SO I WILL JUST CONCENTRATE PERHAPS IN ANOTHER AREA OF CONCERN. WHICH IS WITH IN NETWORK DIALYSIS CENTERS. THE ISSUE THAT WE'RE SEEING OCCURS WHEN THE DIALYSIS CLINIC STAFF FIND PATIENTS WITHIN THEIR CLINICS AND THEN STEER THEM INTO COMMERCIAL COVERAGE WHEN THEY WOULD OTHERWISE BE ABLE TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICARE OUT WITH NO SHARE OF KOSTER MEDICARE. THE DIALYSIS PROVIDER THINK CONNECTS THE PATIENT WITH THE AMERICAN KIDNEY FUND WHICH IS THE RECIPIENT OF CHARITABLE CONTRIBUTIONS FROM THE PROVIDER TO PAY FOR THE PATIENTS PREMIUM. SO IT'S BASICALLY JUST A PASSED THROUGH. THE DIALYSIS PROVIDER THEN BILLS INSURERS THREE TO FOUR TIMES THE AMOUNTS THAT MEDICARE WOULD PAY. FOR THREE TREATMENTS A WEEK FOR MONTHS OR YEARS ON AND THE FINANCIAL INCENTIVE IS OBVIOUS. AND THIS IS NOT JUST A BILLING DISPUTE BETWEEN HEALTH PLANS AND PROVIDERS A CENTER LEYVA POINTED OUT THERE ARE SOME REAL HARM TO CONSUMERS. SO WHAT DOES SQ ELEVEN FIFTY SIX DO TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM THE BILL SIMPLY REQUIRES A FINANCIAL INTERESTED THIRD PARTY PAYERS DO THE RIGHT THING BY THEIR PATIENTS BY KEEPING THEM ON COVERAGE FOR A FULL YEAR. RATHER THAN KICKING THEM OFF WHEN HEALTH INSURANCE CAN NO LONGER BE BUILT THEY MUST NOTIFY PATIENTS OF THEIR OPTIONS AND NOT STEER THEM INTO A PARTICULAR PLAN. AS WE CURRENTLY CHOIR OF OTHER AGENTS AND BROKERS AND THEY MUST LET HEALTH PLANS KNOW THAT THEY ARE PAYING FOR THESE PREMIUMS AND WHETHER THEY'D MET THESE OBLIGATIONS. NOW YOU MAY HAVE HEARD THAT THIS BILL WILL FORCE PEOPLE INTO MEDICARE TAKE AWAY THEIR COMMERCIAL COVERAGE NOTHING IN THIS BILL. REQUIRES ANYONE TO BE ON MEDICARE OR PROHIBITS A FINANCIALLY INTERESTED PROVIDER FROM PAYING THE PREMIUMS FOR COMMERCIAL COVERAGE. THE BILL SIMPLY TAKES THE FINANCIAL INCENTIVE FOR DOING SO WAY BY AUTHOR REYES NAY INSURED TO PAY THE MEDICARE RATE WHERE THE CONTRACT TREAT WHATEVER IS LOWER. WE AGREE WITH THIS COMMITTEE AND MEMONS HE THINK MEET THEY FURTHER STREAMLINE THIS PROCESS AND MAKE IT MORE WORKABLE. AND WE WOULD ASK YOUR AYE VOTE ON THIS IMPORTANT MEASURE. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN COMMITTEE GOING BACK IS FOR DRUG POLICY ALLIANCE DRUG POLICY ALLIANCE IS A NATIONAL ADVOCACY ORGANIZATION. WORKING TO END THE DRUG WAR AND REPLACE IT WITH POLICIES THEIR BALLOT BASED ON HEALTH PUBLIC HEALTH COMPASSION AND HUMAN RIGHTS. OUR INTEREST IN THIS BILL GOES TO THE ISSUE OF ALL THE WORK THAT WE AND OTHER ADVOCATES DID TO ENSURE THE SUBSIDY USE DISORDER TREATMENT WAS IN THE A CS. WE DO NOT FORESEE HOWEVER UNSCRUPULOUS PROVIDERS WOULD SHOW UP IN CALIFORNIA AND TRYING TO GET VANTAGE OF THE ACA BY RECRUITING PATIENTS WITH SUBSIDIES DISORDER FROM OUT OF STATE. MOVING TO CALIFORNIA AND THEN ROLLING THEM IN THE HIGHEST RETURN PAY PLAN THAT THEY COULD. THIS WAS NOT MOTIVATED BY CONCERN FOR THE PATIENT OR THE FAMILY OF THE COMMUNITY BUT BY GREED. AND SO WE WANT TO SEE THAT. PATIENTS ARE GUARANTEED. IF THEY ARE RECRUITED INTO TREATMENT THAT FIRST OFF THEIR FULLY INFORMED OF THEIR OPTIONS WHICH IS FAIR FOR EVERY PATIENT INCLUDING A PERSON WITH THE SUBSIDIES DISORDER AND THEIR FAMILY. THEY'RE GUARANTEED TO YEARS COVERAGE IS OUR PRIMARY INTEREST AS MANY OF YOU KNOW THERE WAS A LOT OF COVERAGE OF THIS PICKED OUT OF ORANGE COUNTY. THAT PEOPLE RECRUITED FROM OUT OF STATE BROUGHT TO CALIFORNIA. THEY RAN THE INSURANCE PREMIUM UP TO ITS MAXIMUM PAYMENT. AND THEN THEY KICKED THEM TO THE CURB QUITE LITERALLY TO THE CURB WHERE THEY WERE THEN HOMELESS IN ORANGE COUNTY. THEY WERE PENDANT ON STREET SERVICES E. OURS AND THEY HAD NO WAY TO GET HOME WITH THAT HOME WAS OHIO WHERE I WORK SOMEPLACE ELSE. FOR THESE REASONS WE LIKE TO MAKE SURE THAT FAMILIES OF ADDICTED PERSONS PEOPLE SUBSTANCE ABUSE DISORDERS. ARE FULLY INFORMED AND HAVE ACCESS TO THE HEALTH CARE INSURANCE IS APPROPRIATE TO THEIR NEED THANK YOU. Q. OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT JUST YOUR NAME AND ORGANIZATION. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS TERAFLOPS CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION IN SUPPORT THANK YOU.

I JUST WANNA LET THIS COMMITTEE KNOW THAT I'VE SEEN THIS SCHEME IN FULL EFFECT FOR YEARS NOW JUST AND I'M ROSE DEADLY AND CLOSE SUPPORT. REPIX CALIFORNIA DISABILITY RIGHTS STRONG SUPPORT THE KNOW WILL BRING IN A BRIEF BACK -- IS THERE ANYONE IN OPPOSITE MISTER CHAIRMAN THE MEMBER SCOTT WORSHIP HAVE TO CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF ELECTRICAL WORKERS TO CALIFORNIA STATE PATRIOTS COUNCIL. AND THE WESTERN STATES COUNCIL SHEET METAL WORKERS. THE ISSUE THAT MY HEALTH TRUST FUNDS HAVE WITH THIS BILL IS ON THE DIALYSIS SIDE NOT ON THE DRUG TREATMENT SIDE. EVEN WITH THE LAST THEIR AMENDMENTS AS I UNDERSTAND WHICH I THINK IMPROVES UPON THE BILL. IT STILL IS BEYOND ME WHY THIS LEGISLATURE. WE WANT TO TAKE WORKERS. WHO HAVE FALLEN ON HARD TIMES? WHO ARE GROSSLY ILL? AND PUSH ALLOW EACH YOU MOST TO PUSH THEM ON TO MEDICARE. SO THAT THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS. ARE THEN LEFT WITHOUT HEALTH INSURANCE. LET ME GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE. IT IS IN A UNION TRUST FUND MULTI EMPLOYER TRUST FUND. AND EMPLOYER PAYS A CERTAIN AMOUNT PER HOUR TO A MEMBERS HEALTH CARE ACCOUNT. THEY DRAW DOWN THAT ACCOUNT ON A MONTHLY BASIS. WHEN THEY GET TOO IF THEY GET UNEMPLOYED AS WE DO AND CONSTRUCTION ON A REGULAR BASIS MY MEMBERS WILL BE OUT OF WORK SOMETIMES A YEAR OR TWO YEARS? WHEN THEY RUN THEIR COUNT DOWN? TO ZERO THEY GET COBRA. MEANING THEY HAVE TO PAY OUT OF THEIR POCKET. TO MAINTAIN THEIR HEALTH INSURANCE NOT JUST FOR THEM. BUT FOR THEIR FAMILY. I KNOW OF TWO INSTANCES WHERE MEMBERS OF MINE HAVE RECEIVED GRANTS THAT HAVE HELPED THEM MAINTAIN THEIR HEALTH INSURANCE. NOT FOR THEMSELVES BECAUSE THEY COULD GOING TO MEDICARE. BUT FOR THEIR FAMILY. SO IT IS BEYOND ME WHY. IT'S A DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLE THAT WE WANT TO FORCE WORKERS. OUT OF THEIR HEALTH INSURANCE FOR THEIR FAMILIES SO THAT. H. YOU MODES CAN SAVE A FEW MONTHS WORTH THE MONEY. BECAUSE REMEMBER THERE ARE THE CAPTIVE THIRTY MONTHS. BEFORE SOMEBODY WITH ON DIALYSIS GETS PUSHED. I TO MEDICARE. SO IS THAT REALLY WHAT WE WANT TO DO. TAKE HEALTHCARE AWAY FROM FAMILIES KNOW THEY COULD GOING TO MEDI CAL. IF THE SPEND DOWN THEIR ASSETS ALL THE WAY DOWN TO TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS. SO I DON'T WANT TO PUT MY MEMBER IN A POSITION OF HAVING TO SAY YOU HAVE TO SELL YOUR HOUSE. AND SPENT EVERY PENNY OF IT. ON HEALTH CARE. SO YOUR FAMILY CAN GET ON MEDI CAL WHEN YOU COULD JUST BE IN OUR UNION TRUST FUND. UP BLUE SHIELD OR A BLUE CROSS THE HEALTH PLAN THROUGH THOSE REASONS I THINK THIS BILL IS FLAWED ON THE DIALYSIS. THANK YOU. BY BY EARLY AGREEMENT WE'D AGREED FOR THREE WITNESSES A TWO MINUTE SCENE SO. SO YOU KNOW WHERE. SO SO THAT EVERYBODY IN THE AUDIENCE NOW SO YOU'VE GOT A COUPLE MINUTES. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN WOOD AND MEMBERS OF THE ASSEMBLY HEALTH. I'M LEVINE BURDEN PRESIDENT AND CEO OF THE AMERICAN KIDNEY FUND LAST YEAR WE HELPED OVER FOUR THOUSAND LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS. OUGHT TO PAY FOR THEIR HEALTH INSURANCE PREMIUMS. I'M HERE TODAY IN OPPOSITION TO SB ELEVEN FIFTY SIX DUE TO SOME CHALLENGES THAT REMAIN IN THE CURRENT VERSION. WE ARE EXTREMELY GRATEFUL TO YOU CHAIRMAN WOULD MD ASSEMBLY HEALTH COMMITTEE FOR INTRODUCING SIGNIFICANT AMENDMENTS TO THE BILL. THESE AMENDMENTS WILL ELIMINATE MANY OF THE PROVISIONS THAT WOULD HARM COVERAGE AND CARE FOR CALIFORNIA DIALYSIS PATIENTS THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY THE SENATE VERSION OF THE BILL. WE THANK EACH MEMBER FOR SPENDING THE TIME THAT YOU HAVE WITH PATIENTS FROM YOUR DISTRICTS OVER THE LAST SEVERAL WEEKS. WE THANK THE CHAIRMAN AND THE COMMITTEE FOR PUTTING FORTH AMENDMENTS TO ELIMINATE THE REQUIREMENT THAT PATIENTS RECEIVING CHARITABLE PREMIUM ASSISTANCE. MUST FIRST APPLY FOR MEDICARE AND MEDICAID OBVIOUS AND WAIT SIXTY DAYS BEFORE THEY COULD RECEIVE ASSISTANCE. WE BELIEVE THAT THE CHANGES THAT HAVE BEEN ACTIVE GO A LONG WAY IN IMPROVING THE BILL HOWEVER. WE ARE UP WE REMAIN CONCERNED ABOUT ISSUES THAT MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR US TO SUPPORT THIS BILL IN ITS CURRENT FORM. LET ME BE ABSOLUTELY CLEAR OUR CONCERN IS NOT ABOUT REIMBURSEMENT RATES WE ADAMANTLY BELIEVE THAT RACE SHOULD BE NEGOTIATED BETWEEN INSURERS AND PROVIDERS. OUR CONCERN IS ABOUT MAINTAINING SUFFICIENT BALANCE IN THE SYSTEM TO ENSURE ACCESS FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE ON DIALYSIS. WHILE WE THINK THAT IT WAS NOT THE INTENTION OF THE COMMITTEE. THE REWRITE POTENTIALLY CAUSES NEW ISSUES FOR PATIENT ACCESS. ESPECIALLY FOR THOSE PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN INNER CITY AND RURAL AREAS. CHARITABLE PREMIUM ASSISTANCE DOES NOT HAVE A VALUE OF PATIENTS IN THESE AREAS CANNOT FIND A PLACE TO RECEIVE THEIR CARE. OUR CONCERN IS THAT ELEVEN FIFTY SIX SB ELEVEN FIFTY SIX AS CURRENTLY WRITTEN. COULD LEAD TO THE CLOSURE OF DIALYSIS CENTERS AND THEY ARE FIVE THREATEN PATIENT ACCESS. IT IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT THAT THE COMMITTEE ANALYZE THIS ISSUE BEFORE PASSING LEGISLATION THAT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO DISRUPT THE AVAILABILITY OF CARE FOR SOME OF CALIFORNIA'S MOST MEDICALLY VULNERABLE CITIZENS. I PATIENTS CANNOT GET TO CARE BECOME THE CLINIC IS CLOSE THEY'RE HELPFUL SUFFERED GREATLY AND THE COST OF CARE WILL INCREASE AS THEY WILL BE HOSPITALIZED MORE AND WILL SEEK. ARE CURATIVE CARE AND OTHER TREATMENTS. WE CAN ALSO TELL YOU THAT THERE IS A LONG HISTORY AND MEDICARE. ABOUT ESTABLISHING A BALANCE BETWEEN PUBLIC AND PRIVATE REIMBURSEMENTS AND THAT IS ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL TO MAKE THE ENTIRE SYSTEM WORK. OUR PROGRAM AT THE AMERICAN KIDNEY FUND WAS ESTABLISHED TWENTY ONE YEARS AGO UNDER FEDERAL ADVISORY OPINION TO ENSURE THAT WE WOULD BE ABLE TO SUPPORT PATIENTS ABILITY. TO CHOOSE THE INSURANCE THAT BEST MEETS THEIR FINANCIAL NEEDS THIS IS THE COMBINATION OF PUBLIC AND PRIVATE. PASSING LEGISLATION THAT SAYS PROVIDERS WILL BE A REIMBURSED AT THE MEDICARE RIGHT FOR PATIENTS WHO RECEIVED CHARITABLE ASSISTANCE SEEMS TO RUN CONTRARY TO THREE DECADES A STATUTE AND REGULATION. AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. THIS WELL ESTABLISHED HISTORY RECOGNIZES THE REALITY THAT PUBLIC PROGRAMS AND PRIVATE INSURERS MUCH SHARE THE BURDEN OF COVERING THIS POPULATION. I WOULD THEREFORE URGE THE COMMITTEE TO CONSIDER THE POTENTIAL BROADER IMPLICATIONS OF THE PAVEMENT MEASURES OF THE BILL. IN ADDITION WE ARE ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT ISSUES ARE PROVISIONS IN THE BILL THAT WOULD MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR US. TO PROVIDE CHARITABLE ASSISTANCE BASED UPON OUR MISSION AS IT WOULD BE LIMITED ONLY TO FINANCIAL NEED WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THE FACT THAT THE AMERICAN KIDNEY FUND FOR ALMOST HALF A CENTURY. HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED NOW TO PROVIDE ASSISTANCE TO PEOPLE WHO ARE HAVE TRANSPLANTS OR WHO ARE ON DIALYSIS MAKING SURE THAT THEY GET THE CARE THEY NEED. I WOULD ALSO URGE YOU TO REMEMBER THAT YOU CAN SAY IT AS MANY TIMES AS YOU WISH BUT AMERICA KIDNEY FUND NOT A FINANCIALLY INTERESTED ORGANIZATION WE URGE YOU TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS BILL BEFORE YOU PASS IT. IF YOU WE HAVE NOW EXCEEDED SEVEN MINUTES MIGHT BE GREEN IT WAS THREE THREE WITNESSES TWO MINUTES EACH SO I'M GONNA ASK. FOR THE WITNESSES THEIR NAME AND POSITION ON THE BILL ONLY HOUSE ONE POINT OUT TO THE COMMITTEE THAT THIS MOCKUP IS NOT COMMITTEE MARKUP THIS IS A MOCK UP. FROM THE FROM THE CALIFORNIA DIALYSIS COUNCIL SO IT LOOKS VERY MUCH LIKE OUR MOCK UP AND JUST WANT TO POINT OUT THAT THERE IS A MARKET THAT IS. FROM THEM WITH SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS SO WITH THAT -- I APOLOGIZE WE WERE PRETTY CLEAR ABOUT WHAT WE WERE WE WE WE ASK WE WERE ASKED THREE WE WERE GIVEN THREE WITNESSES TWO MINUTES EACH WE WENT PAST THAT WENT TO SEVEN MINUTES AND SO JUST ASKING NOW. FOR NAME AND POSITION ON THE BILL PLEASE. JAN THE WALL IS A PATIENT. YES GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN WOULD AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS. YEAH I THINK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO YOU.

BY THE REPRESENTATIVE FOR THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF ELECTRICAL WORKERS THE CALIFORNIA STATE PRIDE PATRIOTS COUNCIL IN THE WESTERN STATE COUNCILS OF SHEET METAL WORKERS I AM HOPING THAT THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO COME TO THE TABLE AND ACTUALLY RESOLVE SOME OF THE CONCERNS. HOW MUCH LIKE THE TERRIBLE FOUNDATIONS AND THE AMERICAN KIDNEY FUND WHICH TESTIFIED TODAY? SEVERAL UNIONS HAVE HEALTH CARE TRUST THAT ACTUALLY ENABLE THE WORKERS AND THEIR FAMILIES TO CONTINUE TO HAVE HEALTHCARE AND THIS IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT FOR CONSTRUCTION WORKERS. WHOSE WORK IS OFTEN IN FLUX AND I WORRY THAT IF A WORKER GOES ON MEDICARE THEIR FAMILIES ALSO LOSE HOT. SO I LIKE TO ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE CONCERNS AS WELL -- I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH HIM ON A QUALIFY MAY VOTE TODAY AND HOPEFULLY WERE ABLE TO FACILITATE A CONVERSATION TO BRING EVERYONE INVOLVED TO RESOLVE SOME. THANK YOU SUMA MEMBER DO ALREADY ANSWERED OUR IN MY CLOTHES WOULD IF YOU'RE COMFORTABLE WITH OKAY VERY GOOD THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR QUESTIONS IT IS A CONFUSING BILL OR CAN BE OF COMPUTING BILL. BOMB I JUST WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR THAT NO ONE WOULD LOSE ACCESS TO DIALYSIS BECAUSE OF THIS BILL THIS IS SIMPLY ABOUT MAKING SURE NO ONE IS PROFITING. OFF OF SOMEONE ELSE'S MISERY SO TO SPEAK -- MISTER WET SHOE CAME IN AND KIND OF DROPPED HIS BOMB AND THEN LEFT HAS NEVER MET WITH ME -- I ASKED TO MEET WITH HIM AND HE NEVER MET WITH ME SO I HEARD HIS CONCERNS FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME TODAY. I SAT ON A LABOR TRUST FUND FOR TWELVE VERY AWARE OF HOW THAT WORKS. IF THE MEMBER HE IS TALKING ABOUT NEEDED THE DIALYSIS THEY WOULD NOT BE DENIED DEL DIALYSIS CARE. THIS BILL WOULD NOT IN ANY WAY SHAPE OR FORM HELP OR HURT HIS FOR THE FAMILY MEMBER BUT THE DIALYSIS WORKER IF THEY WERE ON COBRA OR NOT AND COOPER WOULD STILL HAVE ACCESS. THIRD PARTY PAYERS CAN STILL BE A PART OF THIS AND PAY WE JUST DON'T WANT THEM TO BE ABLE TO PROFIT FROM IT -- THAT ANSWER ALL OF YOUR QUESTIONS. OKAY COME ON UP HERE MISTER WHICH AND ALSO MISTER CHAIR I AM SIR FLOCKS FROM THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION CAN ALSO SHARE LAVERS VIEWPOINT [inaudible] A A SIMILAR CREEL I I I DON'T DISAGREE WITH THE SENATOR'S CONTENTION. THAT ONE OF MY MEMBERS WHO NEEDS DIALYSIS WOULDN'T CONTINUE TO GET DIALYSIS [inaudible] BUT EVERY TRUST FUND WOULD SOME BECOMES ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICARE BECAUSE OF AGE OR BECAUSE OF SOME OTHER QUALIFYING FACTOR. IN THEY ARE THE IN ROLE WE AND THEY GOING TO MEDICARE. THEIR FAMILY IS THEN DROPPED FROM COVERAGE BECAUSE THERE ARE NO LONGER AN ACTIVE PARTICIPANT IN THE TRUST. THERE ARE NO LONGER RECEIVING THEIR HEALTHCARE THROUGH THE TRUST SO THEN THE FAMILY MEMBERS ARE GOING TO BE LEFT. IN YOU AT THIS IS AN ISSUE JUST FOR MY MEMBERS ANY WORKER YOU CARE ABOUT OTHER WORKERS. IF ANY IF IF THE OF A WORKER WHOSE OBTAINING PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE EITHER THROUGH THEIR AMP THROUGH THEIR EMPLOYER. IS FORCED ON A MEDICARE. THEY LOSE COVERAGE FOR THEIR FOR FOR THEIR WIVES THEIR BABIES AND THEY AND THEY THEN HAVE TO GO ON MEDI CAL BUT YOU DON'T QUALIFY. ON MEDI CAL INTO YOU HAVE ASSETS OF NO MORE THAN TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS SO YOU'RE FORCING THAT WORKER TO HAVE TO SPEND DOWN THEIR ASSETS SO THEY QUALIFY FOR MEDICAID. AND THAT'S WHAT I OBJECT IT IF I MAY MISTER CHAIR WHAT YOU SAID INITIALLY IS WHEN ONE OF YOUR MEMBERS WHO ARE MANY TIMES OUT OF WORK FOR MANY MONTHS AT A TIME. AND HOUSE TO GOING COBRAR THEN LOOSES COBRA WOULD LOSE THEIR COVERAGE SO WHAT I WAS RESPONDING TO WAS YOUR INITIAL ASSERTION THAT YOUR MEMBER WOULD LOSE COVERAGE WHAT YOU JUST SAID ABOUT MEDICARE. IS CORRECT BUT THAT WAS NOT YOUR FIRST ASSERTION. I APOLOGIZE MY LETTER TO THE COMMITTEE WAS CLEAR I THOUGHT MY TESTIMONY WAS CLEAR I'M NOT DISPUTING THE FACT THAT THE THAT THE WORKER WILL GO ON MEDICARE AND WILL GET IS DIALYSIS. I'M WORRIED ABOUT THE FAMILY MEMBERS WHO HAVE TO LOSE THEIR HEALTHCARE SO NAY CHAMO CAN SAVE A LITTLE BIT OF MONEY. IT'S ACTUALLY NOT WHAT THE BILL DOES BUT WE APPRECIATE YOUR OPINION. PLEASE NO NO [inaudible] WHO WIENER [inaudible] OTHER. I SUB COUPLE COMES SO -- THANK YOU SENATOR LIVE FOR BRAIN FOREIGN AS YOU KNOW THE COST OF HEALTHCARE IS CONTINUALLY GO UP. AND THE TYPES OF PAYMENTS SINCE RELATIONSHIPS PLAY A PART OF THAT -- AYE I REALLY APPRECIATE YOU GONNA DO SOME AMENDMENTS IT TAKES MORE TIME ON THIS. I'M CONCERNED ABOUT MY RURAL PEOPLE I'M CONCERNED CONSUMERS THE MAY SUFFER UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES AS A RESULT OF THIS SO I DON'T WANT THE NEW LANGUAGE TO BE ANY WIDER IMPACT ON PATIENTS AND PROVIDERS THAT ARE GOOD ACTORS BECAUSE THERE ARE SOME GOOD ONES THAT ARE OUT THERE. AND TRULY PROVIDING NECESSARY ASSISTANCE SO ALSO PUT YOUR BILL TODAY -- HOWEVER I HOPE TO SEE IT CHANGING IT ONLY BETTER BY THE TIME IT COMES TO THE FLOOR. I APPRECIATE THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER WE ARE ALWAYS LOOKING FOR OUR BILLS TO GET BETTER AND IF YOU HAVE ANY SPECIFIC -- ISSUES OR IDEAS PLEASE LET ME KNOW. AND AND I WOULD JUST SAY THAT -- KF THAT THIS BILL COULD CAUSE THE CLOSURE OF DIALYSIS CLINICS WHICH I THINK MIGHT GO TO TO YOUR CONCERN ABOUT YOUR RURAL FOLKS. BEFORE EVER INTRODUCED THIS BILL I HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO MEET WITH TO THE BIGGEST -- PROVIDE DIALYSIS PROVIDERS AND ONE OF THEM LET ME KNOW THAT THEY WERE GOING TO CONTINUE TO OPEN DIALYSIS -- CLINICS BECAUSE THEY WERE SO PROFITABLE SO I DON'T KNOW THAT WE NEED TO WORRY ABOUT THIS IN THIS BILL [inaudible] THANK YOU. IT'S MY RATIOS I ALWAYS HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT IT. FAIR ENOUGH. MAY WAS CHAIR OF IN JUST A FEW QUESTIONS THAT I THINK THERE ARE COMPLEXITIES THIS BILL OF REGARDLESS OF WHERE PERSON. YOU KNOW LANDS ON IT CAN TURN TO THEIR OPINION. TODAY WE HEARD FROM PATIENTS SOME WHO SAID THEY SUPPORT AND SOME SAY THEY OPPOSE AND I THINK THAT WE OWE IT. TO THE PUBLIC HEALTH TO HAVE A ROBUST CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT IS TRUE AND WHAT IS NOT -- SO THAT WE GET ALL -- YOU KNOW MAKE A VOTE TODAY WITH CONFIDENCE THAT WHAT WE'RE DOING IS IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH AND I KNOW THAT'S YOUR ATTENTION SENATOR NIGHT RESHAPE THAT. YOU AND YOUR STAFF TO MAKE YOURSELF AVAILABLE TO MEDIAN OTHERS OF THE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE AND I APPRECIATE THAT THAT SIDE I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON IN THIS. YEAH -- IN SO YOU KNOW IF YOU USE WITH THE CHAIR SUPPORT UNLIKE DOES* WE MAKE IT PLAIN AND WE JUST SAY. WHY WE'RE DOING WHAT WE'RE DOING? AND WHY WE OPPOSE IT KNOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF AND WHEN WE DO IT RANK THIS BREAKDOWN RIGHT. SO. IF I HAD IT WRONG SISTANI BUT AS I UNDERSTAND IT -- THAT THERE ARE SOME COMPANIES THAT PROVIDE DIALYSIS THAT GET UP BASICALLY [inaudible] PROFIT. BY USING THIRD PARTY PAYERS TEND TO HELP. THOSE WHO NEED DIALYSIS TREATMENT AND THEY'RE ABLE TO GET THERE BUT A BILL AT A MUCH HIGHER RATE THAN THEY WOULD IF THOSE INDIVIDUALS WERE SERVED BY MEG CAO. COME I DON'T HOW MUCH DOES SO YOU'RE LEARN JUST RIGHT IRAQ I GOTTA GO SLOW MY AND SO -- THIS BILL WOULD SAY THAT YOU HAVE TO VERIFY THAT SOMEONE IS ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICARE THAT IS CORRECT AND DOES IT ALSO MEAN THAT. IF THAT PERSON IS ELIGIBLE THEY CAN NO LONGER ACCEPT THAT THIRD PARTY PAYMENT THAT DONATION BUT THAT THEY MUST IN FACT. BECOME A MEDIC CAO PATIENT NO THE WOULD JUST BE THE A REIMBURSEMENT RATE WOULD JUST BE AT THE MEDI CAL RATE. FOR MEDICARE RIGHT SO THEY CAN CONTINUE TO RECEIVE THE DONATION FROM THE CHARITABLE ENTITY YEAH UP BUT THE PROVIDER WHO PROVIDES THE DIALYSIS HAST ONLY BE REIMBURSED AT THE RATE THAT THEY WOULD IF THIS PERSON WAS ON MEDI CAL. THAT IS CORRECT GLAD THAT'S BEEN CLARIFIED -- IN I WANT TO HEAR FROM THE OPPOSITION IF ANYONE IF IF ANYTHING THAT WE ARE SAYING. IS DIFFERENT YES MA'AM. THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- THANK YOU SO MUCH. THAT THE ISSUE HERE. IS THAT PROVIDED THE THE THE SYSTEM. THAT ALLOWS DIALYSIS SERVICES TO BE PROVIDED HAS ALWAYS ASSUMED FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE PROGRAM. THAT THEY ARE OUR PUBLIC PROGRAMS THAT ARE AVAILABLE AND MOST PEOPLE USE THOSE AND THEY WORK WELL FOR MOST PEOPLE. ECONOMIC ASSIST SYSTEM ALSO ASSUMES AND THERE'S A WHOLE HISTORY OF FEDERAL LEGISLATION THAT THERE WOULD ALSO BE SOME FOLKS WOULD USE PRIVATE INSURANCE. IT TAKES THE COMBINATION OF THOSE THINGS TO MAKE THE SYSTEM WORK WHEN THAT COMBINATION DOES NOT WORK DIALYSIS CENTERS WILL BEGIN TO CLOSE. SOME OF THEM ALREADY LOSING MONEY AND THE WHEN WHEN THAT HAPPENS WHEN THOSE REIMBURSEMENT RATES WHEN THAT BALANCE IS NOT ESTABLISH MORE OF THEM WILL LOSE AND SOME OF THEM WILL CLOSE THE PROBLEM IS THE PEOPLE WHO ARE ON DIALYSIS HAVE TO GO THREE TIMES A WEEK THREE OF FOUR HOURS -- MY FRIEND HERE WHO HAS THE DIALYSIS PATIENT UNDERSTANDS THAT VERY WELL SHE NOW GOES TO DIALYSIS CENTER THAT'S CLOSE TO HER HOME. IF CENTERS CLOSE THOSE DIALYSIS CENTERS MAY INVOLVE A MUCH LONGER DISTANCE OF TRAVEL WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE 75280% OF WHOM ARE UNEMPLOYED BECAUSE OF THE TREATMENT BECAUSE OF THE DISEASE. THEY DON'T HAVE THE MONEY. THEY DON'T OFTEN DON'T HAVE PRIVATE TRANSPORTATION CANNOT AFFORD PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION DO NOT HAVE SOMEBODY TO TAKE THEM HOW WILL THEY GET TO THE CARE THAT THEY NEED THAT IS THE ACCESS ISSUE SO LET ME ASK YOU THIS I AGREE. I THINK WE AGREE. AND TELL ME IF I'M WRONG I WANT IT IS OPTIONS THAT MEDICARE RATES ARE LOW. AND THAT IT MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO SERVE PEOPLE IN EVERY SPECTRUM OF HEALTH CARE DELIVERY BECAUSE OF THOSE RATES BEING LOW IT MAKES A HARPER PROVIDERS. TO SERVE EVERYONE I I THINK WE AGREE ON THAT I THINK THAT'S A MATTER THAT WE HAVE TO WORK ON HOW TO INCREASE MEDICARE REIMBURSEMENT RATES -- AND IT'S MEDICARE I STEERED YOU WRONG BY SAYING MEDI CAL I APOLOGIZE. THAT OKAY -- BUT WHAT I HEARD IS THAT A PERSON DOESN'T LOSE THE ABILITY TO TAKE THE THIRD PARTY PAYMENTS UNDER THIS BILL. DO YOU DISAGREE WITH THAT DC I YEAH YOU MISTER CHAIR DESTRUCTOR MUCH. AYE AYE MISS WHAT I DO HAVE SOME QUESTIONS FOR YOU THE US LET THEM. GIVE PERSON WILL NOT LOSE THE MEDICARE WILL NOT LOSE THE THIRD PARTY REIMBURSEMENT BUT THE THIRD PARTY REIMBURSEMENT IS OF NO USE IF YOU DON'T HAVE A CENTER WHERE YOU CAN GO TO GET DIE OUT UNDERSTOOD. UNDERSTOOD THAT AND SO I THINK AT LEAST FOR NOW FEELS LIKE THIS CLARITY ABOUT THAT PART OF THE BILL. IN ITS COMPLEXITIES THE SECOND PART IS THE PART THAT HAS TO DO WITH THOSE -- FOLKS WHO WORK IN LABOR WHO SOMETIMES HAVE SEASONAL WORK AND SOMETIMES -- HAVE TO GO -- ON COBRA AND YOU KNOW I I WAS CONCERNED HEAR THAT SOMEONE WOULD BASICALLY HAVE TO GIVE UP THEIR INSURANCE OR FOR THEIR DEPENDENTS. IN ORDER TO RECEIVE BENEFITS BECAUSE REQUIREMENTS OF THIS BILL. THAT IS THAT IS NOT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF SOMEONE HIT THE THAT MEMBER. YOU KNOW BETTER THAN I MISTER WHICH PLEASE ANSWER [inaudible] MISTER CHAIRMAN -- IT WOULD WHEN YOU ARE CO BRED. AND YOU ARE PAYING AND YOU CAN'T AFFORD TO PAY THAT ANY LONGER. AND YOU FALL OUT OF YOUR HEALTH CARE YOU GOING TO MEDICARE -- YOUR FAMILY MEMBERS DON'T FOLLOW WITH YOU OKAY MEDICARE'S GOING TO BE FOR THE FOR THE PERSON WITH THE REAL DISEASE THEY'RE GONNA GO ON MEDICARE THEIR FAMILY WHICH WAS GETTING THEIR EMPLOYER HEALTH CARE. ARE GONNA BE DROPPED RIGHT. THAT'S IN IT IN. I'M STILL TRYING LOOK AT THE AMENDMENTS WERE TAKEN AT THE BACK BUT MY UNDERSTANDING PLEASE CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG. IS THAT THE BILL IS STILL PERMISSIVE FOR THE HEALTH PLAN TO ACCEPT THE GRANTS THAT HAS NOT CHANGED TO YOUR FIRST QUESTION. MEANING IF YOU VOTE FOR THIS BILL YOU'RE GIVING THE FLEXIBILITY TO THE HMO TO SAY NO WE'RE NOT GONNA TAKE THE GRANTS AND THAT'S THAT'S IT MUST BE AMENDMENTS THAT WERE TAKEN EARLIER. CHANGE THAT THE BILL AS WRITTEN IS STILL MAY. OKAY SO WE'RE GONNA GO TO THAT BUT BEFORE WE DO I LIKE TO ASK YOU MISTER WHICH AND THEN THE AUTHOR. I I I I FAMILIAR WITH COBRA. AND I'M FAMILIAR WITH SOME OF THE WORK THAT YOU MEMBERS DO AND THAT IT CAN BE SEASONAL. AND IT WOULD BE A CONCERN TO ME IF SOMEONE WAS ESSENTIALLY FORCED TO GIVE UP THEIR INSURANCE FOR THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS FOR THEIR DEPENDENTS. I WANT TO ASK THE AUTHOR HOW THE BILL SPEAKS TO THAT BECAUSE I UNDERSTAND THAT THE BILL WAS STE WHO AT LEAST ATTEMPTING TO CREATE. SOME WORKAROUNDS -- FOR FOLKS WHO FALL IN A UNIQUE SITUATION LIKE THOSE THAT YOU READ BUT BEFORE BEFORE YES APPRECIATE I APPRECIATE THE QUESTION THE OFFER SOMETHING THAT MAYBE THAT TERRIFIES AND MAYBE DOES AND I'M NOT TRYING TO MUDDY THE WATER WHICH IS ALREADY REALLY. WHY NOT LET'S PUT SOME MORE MONEY? LOOK MY AMENDMENTS WERE INTENDED TO AVOID DISRUPTION FOR PATIENTS. BUT ELIMINATE THE FINANCIAL INCENTIVES. THAT WAS MY INTENTION NOTHING IN THE BILL WILL TO PROHIBIT THE COMPANIES FROM CONTINUING TO DONATE TO FOUNDATION SET UP TO HELP PATIENTS. BUT THIS WILL TEST WHETHER COMPANIES ARE MAKING THE DONATIONS TO TRULY HELP PEOPLE OR JUST TO AUGMENT THEIR BOTTOM LINE. SO SYMPATHETIC AS PEOPLE -- ARE HERE YOU KNOW ABOUT I MEAN I CAN APPRECIATE WHERE YOU'RE COMING FROM -- MISTER WET WE ALL HAVE TO DEAL WITH THAT IT WITH COBRA AT SOME POINT YES IT IT IS A IT IS IT IS IT IS AN ISSUE SO. I DON'T KNOW IF I MADE IT CLEAR ARE MADE HERE NO NO I THINK MISTER CHAIR YOUR YOUR RE STATEMENT ABOUT THE AMENDMENTS IS HELPFUL. I THINK WE HAVE ESTABLISHED THAT EVEN IF THIS BILL PASSES THAT -- A THIRD PARTY CAN STILL MAKE A DONATION. AND AND OF THE REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE AMERICAN CAN FUN ALSO AGREED THAT THAT IS STILL THE CASE THAT NOW THEY HAVE A DIFFERENT ARGUMENT. THEIR THEIR ARGUMENT IS THAT. THEY'LL BE LESS REVENUE OVERALL TO SUPPORT THE INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDED TO SUPPORT EVERYBODY WHO NEED SERVICE THAT'S A DIFFERENT QUESTION BUT AT LEAST ON THIS I THINK WE HAVE AGREEMENT AND YOUR AMENDMENTS. REALLY POINT THAT OUT CLEARLY THAT NOTHING ABOUT THIS BILL SAYS THAT THIRD PARTIES CANNOT CONTINUE TO CONTRIBUTE TO SUPPORT THE HEALTH CARE NEEDS A SOMEWHAT DIALYSIS. I THINK WHAT WE ARE IN THE MOMENT -- DEALING WITH SOME -- NEED FOR MORE CLARITY I'LL SAY IT THAT WAY IS ON THIS ISSUE OF THOSE WHO -- ARE REPRESENTED BY THE TRUSTS WHO COULD BE SEASONALLY Y. WORKING AND WOULD THEY BE FORCED TO GIVE UP THEIR ASSETS. TO ESSENTIALLY BECOME ELIGIBLE-- FOR MEDICARE -- IT IF I MAY MISTER CHARITIES I'D LIKE TO ASK JOHN FROM SEIU TO RESPOND. THANK YOU JOHN ALLEN SEIU UNITED HEALTHCARE WORKERS ALSO HERE WITH LABOR IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS BILL SPEAKING DIRECTLY TO THE COBRA ISSUE. TO A A SEASONAL WORKER WHO WOULD SOMETIMES BE ON COBRA AND SOMETIMES BE COVERED BY -- BY A TRUSTS HEALTH INSURER NO DIFFERENT. ANY OTHER PATIENT AND AS THE CHAIR SAID -- THERE IS NOTHING IN THE BILL THAT PROHIBITS A THIRD PARTY FROM MAKING THOSE PAYMENTS TO PROVIDE HEALTH INSURANCE COVERAGE TO PAY THAT COBRA PREMIUM. FOR EXACTLY THE THE WORKER THAT WAS DESCRIBED NOTHING IN THE BILL PROHIBITS THAT COBRA PAYMENT. ALL THAT WOULD HAPPEN IS THAT IF IT IS A FINANCIALLY INTERESTED PAVEMENT BY FINANCIALLY INTERESTED CITY. THEN IT WOULD TRIGGER THAT MEDIC ABOUT LOWER OF THE MEDICARE RATES OR THE CONTRACTED RATE. SO THERE IS. NO REASON WHY A PERSON WOULD BE FORCED OFF OF COBRA. AND ON TO MEDICARE [inaudible] IN LESS. THE THIRD PARTY ENTITY IS CHOOSING TO TO NO LONGER MAKE THOSE PAYMENTS BECAUSE THE PROVIDER WOULD RECEIVE A LOWER REIMBURSEMENT RATE SO THE MESSAGE I THINK I FOLLOWED THAT AND I THINK WHAT I HEARD YOU SAY. IS THAT -- A THIRD PARTY ENTITY COULD MAKE A CONTRIBUTION TO HELP SOMEONE WHO IS A CORPORATE STYLE HEALTH INSURANCE THEY CAN CONTINUE ON THAT FORM OF HEALTH INSURANCE AND CONTINUE TO GET. TREATMENT DO. THE ASSURANCE THAT THEY HAVE THE COOPER THAT IS CORRECT IN SO OF MR WHICH JUST SO I'M CLEAR. ARE THERE SCENARIOS WHERE. HAVE WE MISSED ANYTHING TO THE ASSERTION THAT THE THIRD PARTY SURE THIS BILL DOES NOT PROHIBIT THE THIRD PARTY INSURERS. FROM PAYING FOR SAY WHEN YOU'RE MEMBERS WHO HAS CORPORATE TO CONTINUE IN THAT SAME LINE OF INSURANCE WE MISS ANYTHING ON THAT NOW I NEED TO LOOK AT THE AMENDMENTS AS ARE TAKEN THEY WERE REFLECTED IN THE ANALYSIS SELECT AFTER LOOKING OKAY SENT BACK TO OUR LAWYERS THE TRUCK. ITEMS AND SEE IF THERE'S A IMPACT GOT A QUESTION TO THE AUTHOR INTO THE PROPONENTS ARE IT -- MAY BE OPPONENTS IS THERE NYTHING ABOUT THIS BILL THAT SAYS IF TWENTY THREE MINUTES A MEMBER. OF ONE OF THESE GROUPS AND IS ALL CORPORA -- THAT HE HAS TO GIVE ME. THAT SOMEONE WHO IS -- A SEASONAL WORKER AND CORPORATE WOULD NOT QUALIFY. FROM MEDICARE -- IN THEIR CURRENT FINANCIAL SITUATION AND THAT OF THE THIRD PARTY GROUP WAS GOING TO CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THEIR CARE THAT THERE WOULD BE NO REASON UNDER THIS BILL FOR THAT TO CHANGE BUT I DON'T MAKE ANY ASSUMPTIONS. THAT IS CORRECT THE I THINK THE ONLY REASON THAT SOMEONE WOULD NOT NO LONGER BE A COBRA IS IF THEIR TIME RAN OUT MOST THE TIME YOU'RE ONLY ENTITLED TO BE ON COVER FOR EIGHTEEN MONTHS GOT IT -- ANYHOW THIS ASK FROM THOSE OF FROM AMERICA KIDNEY FUND OR OTHERS. IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU SEE DIFFERENTLY THAT THIS BILL SAYS THAT A PERSON'S OWN COBRA WHO WANT TO STAY ON COBRA WHO REALLY DOESN'T QUALIFY FOR MEDICARE. IN ALL LIKELIHOOD -- WOULD IT BE ABLE TO CONTINUE RECEIVING THEIR CARE THROUGH THEIR CORPORATE ARRANGEMENT WITH THE SUPPORT OF A THIRD PARTY. IS THERE ANYTHING THAT WE'VE MISSED. SO LONG AS WE HAD RESOURCES WE COULD HELP THAT PERSON ARE CONCERNED AS I MENTIONED BEFORE IS THAT. THE IN IN LOOKING AT THIS LEGISLATION AS REVISED ALTHOUGH THERE ARE A LOT OF IMPROVEMENTS IN IT WE'RE CONCERNED THAT THERE ARE GRAVE IMPLICATIONS FOR THE AVAILABILITY OF DIALYSIS CARE THAT HAVE NOT BEEN LOOK THAT HAVE NOT BEEN CONSIDERED. AND WE THINK THAT IN THE INTEREST OF PATIENTS IN THE CITY AND IN THIS CUT IN THE STATE THAT IT IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND ALL THE IMPLICATIONS FOR ACCESS BEFORE THIS BILL IS ACTED ON AYE I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT THAT WE HAVE TO HAVE A COMPETITION BUT THE LONG. TERM -- ABILITY OF OUR STATE AND NATION TO SERVE A DIALYSIS PATIENTS IN PATIENTS WITH OTHER OTHER CONDITIONS I AM IN TERMS OF WHAT'S RIGHT IN FRONT OF US TODAY. AND IT SEEMS TO ME THAT IN THIS CONVERSATION WITH BEEN LIFTED UP HIS AT THIS BILL DOES NOT FOR SOMEONE TO GIVE UP THEIR COOPER ARRANGEMENT. ARM AND AND IT DOESN'T A THIRD PARTY. PORTER TO SUPPORT SOMEONE SCARE WHICH SEEM TO HAVE BEEN THE TWO MAJOR ISSUES I AT HIM I I WOULD SAY THAT THAT IS TRUE BUT WHAT I WOULD WHAT I WOULD RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE WITH IS THAT THIS REALLY IS NOT A LONG TERM ISSUE IT REALLY IS AN IMMEDIATE IMPACT. AND THAT IS THE CONCERN I YOU KNOW WHAT I STAND CORRECTED YOU'RE RIGHT HE HAS SHORT TERM URGENCY AND I THINK WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HUESO ADDRESS. THANK YOU THANK YOU I THINK I THINK THAT'S IT FOR MY QUESTIONS MISTER THANK YOU FOR THE LATITUDE COURSE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THINK -- ESTIMATES. NOTHING WAS CHAIR -- IT'S INTERESTING LISTEN TO THE CONVERSATION HERE AND I'VE ONLY BEEN A LEGISLATURE FOR FOUR YEARS BUT I CAN TELL YOU THAT THERE'S A LOT OF DECISIONS THAT ARE. MADE HERE BASED UPON YOUR INNATE BIASES -- SOMETIMES -- YOU MAY HAVE YOU KNOW CONFIRMATION BIAS WHERE IT'S LIKE WELL IF IT'S THIS PERSON'S THEN I'M ADAMANTLY OPPOSE OF ITS US PERSONS AYE MADLY AYE I'M I'M IN SUPPORT OF TO BE FAIR OUT TO THE AUTHOR. I WHEN I FIRST SAW YOUR NAME I WAS LIKE I'M GONNA BE OPPOSED. YEAH I WEAR THAT AS A BADGE OF HONOR THE WELL. SO DO I SO DO I BUT GOT GREAT REGARD FOR YOU AND WE DO REPRESENT THE SAME THE SAME COUNTIES. SURE THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT WILL BE ABLE TO TO WORK ON BUT I'LL TELL YOU WHEN I FIRST SAW THIS -- MODE LIKE OF COURSE I'M. I'M I'M OPPOSED. WHEN I HEARD THAT -- WE'RE GOING TO BAN NON NON PROFITS FROM BEING ABLE TO GIVE PREVIOUS PREMIUM ASSISTANCE. I JUST SOME OF MY COMMUNITY I WAS LIKE NO ABSOLUTELY NOT THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH NON PROFITS. THAT BEING ABLE TO THAT TO GET PREMIUM ASSISTANCE ABOUT FOLKS IN MY HOMETOWN THAT ARE BARELY ABLE TO MAKE ENDS MEET MOM AND WE'VE GOT -- DIALYSIS FACILITY IN MY HOME TO LAST A COUPLE OF YEARS AND I WANNA MAKE SURE THOSE FOLKS I'M STILL HAVE SERVICE AND I KNOW THAT ALL OF US IN OUR I'M OFFICES OF HAD FOLKS IS SHOWING UP. NAM AND SAYING YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THE SERVICE. IGNORANCE CAN BE BLISS SOMETIMES AND FOR ME IT WAS AND HOW I STARTED TO DIG INTO THIS MORE AND MORE AND MORE. AND THE THING THAT I BEGAN TO REALIZE WAS. MY GOODNESS THEIR GAME IN THE SYSTEM HERE. THERE WAS ONE PARTICULAR -- TERM I'M WHEN I ASKED THE QUESTION OF WHAT WOULD HAPPEN -- IF FOLKS STOPPING IN THIS YOU KNOW WE WENT BILL TO PROVIDE THAT SERVICE ANYMORE. NOW SO COUPLE QUESTIONS JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT I'M THAT BACK TO MR THURMAN'S -- QUESTIONS ON TO MAKE SURE WE GET THIS -- THIS CORRECT. IF MY MOM IF I WAS ON A FIVE THAT IF A RELATIVE -- WANTED TO PAY FOR PREMIUM ASSISTANCE. WOULD ANYTHING CHANGE IF THEY CONTINUE TO KEEP PAYMENT PREMIUMS PREMIUM ASSISTANCE NO. SO IT'S ONLY FOR THOSE PEOPLE WHO A FINANCIAL INCENTIVE -- THAT'S THE ONLY THE ONLY DIFFERENCES CORRECT. SO THERE'S A QUESTION THAT THEN POPS UP. IS WHY WHY DO WE DO THIS ARBITRAGE THAT'S WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE TO ME WE HAVE AYE NONPROFIT THAT'S OUT HERE THAT FOLKS ARE. BY WRITING CONTRIBUTIONS TO TO BE ABLE TO PROP UP THOSE. OF THIS PREMIUM PAYMENTS BECAUSE MY GUESS IS IS THAT THE PRIVATE PAYERS PAY SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN WHAT MEDICARE A CITIES ON THE GROUND. SO LIKE TO MAYBE DIG INTO THAT QUESTION. A LITTLE BIT WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE SO IF I'M BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW FOR WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT DIALYSIS. SO IF I GO ON MONDAY WEDNESDAY FRIDAY WHAT IS MEDICARE PAY FOR THAT ONE PARTICULAR SERVICE ON ON A MONDAY WHAT'S WHAT IS MEDICARE PAY. I LOWER MY EXPERTS ANSWER -- MEDICARE PAYS BETWEEN TWO HUNDRED FIFTY AND THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS PER TREATMENT MCKENNA. AND COMMERCIAL RATES FOR THE LARGE FOR PROFIT DIALYSIS CENTERS ARE GENERALLY AROUND A THOUSAND DOLLARS PER TREATMENT. AND YOU HAVE TO HOW MANY TIMES A DAY OR A WEEK SOMETIMES A WEEK. HUNDRED AND FIFTY TREATMENTS PER YEAR SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE THEN NOT SO. YOU'RE LOOKING AT EASILY A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS IN DIFFERENCE BETWEEN. COMMERCIAL AND MEDICARE RIGHT AND HOW MUCH WITH THE PREMIUM PAYMENT BE THE PREMIUM ASSISTANCE ARE BEING PAID. A BY THE NONPROFIT FOR THAT YEAR HOW MUCH. IT WOULD THOUSAND FIFTEEN HUNDRED SO MAYBE FIFTEEN THOUSAND SO DO PRETTY WELL WE WERE TALKING ABOUT A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF MONEY. SEVENTY FIVE EIGHTY EIGHTY THOUSAND DOLLARS MY GOODNESS THAT'S THAT'S SMART BUSINESS. THE PROBLEM IS. THE PROBLEM IS. IS THAT IN OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM IS ONE THING THAT I'VE LEARNED IS THAT WERE GAME IN EVERYBODY'S GAME EVERYBODY. AND WE HERE HAVE THESE THESE COMMITTEE HEARINGS AND YOU GOT THE DOCKS TRYING TO GAME THE HOSPITAL'S TRYING TO GAME THE PROVIDERS. AND THE REASON THAT OUR HEALTHCARE COSTS CONTINUE TO KEEP ESCALATING IS BECAUSE EVERYBODY'S GAME AND EVERYBODY. AT SOME POINT IN TIME THAT HOUSE TO STOP NOW. AS THE VICE CHAIR I MET WITH LOTS OF DIFFERENT FOLKS SAYING LOOK WE GOTTA FIGURE OUT A WAY. TO BE ABLE TO COME UP WITH -- MAYBE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD AND WE WORKED WITH THAT THE CHAIR TO TRY TO COME UP WITH THAT. AND THEY WANT TO FIND OUT THE AMENDMENT WAS IS JUST APPLY THAT THE MEDICARE RIGHT I THOUGHT WELL. I REMEMBER EFFECTS I MEMBER THIS DISCUSSION JUST A FEW WEEKS AGO WRONG BUT 80% OF OUR PATIENTS ARE ALREADY ON MEDICARE IS ALREADY PAINT. TO SO IT'S ONLY THE EXTRA 20% OF PATIENTS AND THAT ARE THAT ARE BUT THAT THAT THE THAT THE PRIVATE PROVIDERS ARE ARE PAYING THAT INCREASED THAT INCREASED AMOUNT WHAT'S WRONG WITH. SAYING LOOK YOU CAN STILL GIVE TO AMERICA KIDNEY FUND YOU CAN GIVE TO A NONPROFIT. BUT IF THERE'S STUFF BUT ELIMINATE THE FINANCIAL INCENTIVE YOU JUST ARE GOING TO HAVE TO PAY THE MEDICARE RATE. I THINK THAT TAKES MOST OF ALL THE ARGUMENTS. OFF THE TABLE AND SO I THINK WHEN I SAW THOSE AMENDS BETWEEN THECHAIR OF THE COMMITTEE IN THE THE AUTHOR I'M NOT QUITE SURE MORE OF WHAT WE CAN DEAL. NOW I CAN CHOOSE -- BECAUSE I'VE HAD THOSE PATIENTS IN MY ARE IN MY OFFICE AND I'VE HAD THOSE PHONE CALLS INTO MY DISTRICT OFFICE IN. TO THE CAPITOL OFFICE I CAN CHOOSE TO TO TURN A BLIND EYE. TO THAT BUT THE FACT IS FOLKS ARE GAME IN THE SYSTEM. WE GOTTA DO SOMETHING ABOUT THAT. SO I'LL BE SUPPORTING THIS TODAY. THANK YOU SO WHENEVER. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS WAS WELCOME. IT'S TOUGH IT'S HARD WHEN WE HAVE SO MANY PEOPLE ON BOTH SIDES IN THE SO MANY ISSUES. AND NOT YOU KNOW I JUST WANT TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE SUBSTANCE USE. ISSUE BECAUSE I'M VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THAT [inaudible] ALSO PALM. SOME TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW THE RATES COULD EVEN BE. AFFECTED OR CHANGED. BECAUSE WHEN WE LOOKED AT SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER. RAISING REIMBURSEMENT RATES TO HER TO HELP FOR TREATMENT. WE WERE TOLD BY THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES ON THE RECORD AND I HAVE THE TRANSCRIPT OF COURSE I DON'T HAVE WITH ME BUT THAT THAT. THAT THEY DON'T SET RATES. SENATE STONE THROUGH ODS AND THE WAIVERS ON THAT THE COUNTIES OF SENDING THE RATES FOR THOSE TREATMENTS SO IF WE COULDN'T. REYES THE REIMBURSEMENT RATES HOW WOULD YOU BE ABLE TO LOWER THEM. WITHOUT GOING COUNTY BY COUNTY BY COUNTY. A SIMILAR BERMAN ASK AND RESPOND ABOUT. YES THANK YOU. I THINK WHAT WE'RE SEEING THIS OCCUR AN IS THAT -- COMMERCIAL HEALTH INSURANCE MARKET. SO WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS ADDRESS JUST THE COMMERCIAL MARKET AND WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN THE SUBSTANCE ABUSE SPACE IS THAT IT'S GENERALLY OUT OF NETWORK SUCH A SUPERUSER TREATMENT CENTERS THEIR ADAM NETWORK. SO YOU DON'T HAVE A CONTRACT WITH THEM FOR A PARTICULAR RATE. WHAT THEIR THEN I'M NOT PAINTBRUSH IN ALL OF THEM THIS IS JUST SOME OF THE BAD ACTORS BUT WHAT THEY'LL DO IS THEY'LL GO AND GET PEOPLE TO COME IN BY USING A BODY WHAT THEY CALL BY THE BROKERS WE'VE HEARD? THOSE BILLS IN THIS COMMITTEE AND AND THEY'LL GO AND GET PEOPLE TO JOIN GIVING THEM INCENTIVES LIKE WE'RE GOING TO GIVE YOU A SCHOLARSHIP ALLIANCE PEOPLE DON'T EVEN KNOW THEY'RE BEING SIGNED UP FOR HEALTH INSURANCE THEY'RE ADDICTED PEOPLE. AND VULNERABLE THEY BRING THEM INTO THESE TREATMENT CENTERS. AND THEN THEY SIGN HIM UP FOR HEALTH INSURANCE BECAUSE THEY KNOW THAT THEY CAN BUILD THE HEALTH INSURANCE FOR FAR MORE THAN THEY'RE GOING TO PAY IN PREMIUM PAYMENTS. THEN AFTER THE NINETY DAY TREATMENT PLAN IS OVER AND THEY KNOW THEY'RE GOING TO BE QUESTIONED ABOUT WHY THIS PERSON STILL. TERRIBLY ADDICTED THE DAILY AS MY COLLEAGUE SAID THEY LITERALLY KICKING TO THE CURB. WHERE THINGS THAT THIS BILL DOES IS IT REQUIRES A THIRD PARTY -- PAYER WHOSE FINANCIALLY INTERESTED IN PAYING FOR A FULL YEAR OF OF PREMIUMS INSTEAD OF THIS KICKING HIM TO THE CURB WHEN YOU CAN'T BILL HEALTH INSURERS ANYMORE. DURING THAT TIME CARRY BECAUSE THEY'RE OUT OF NETWORK THEIR BILL CHARGES ARE EX IS PART. THOUSANDS UPON THOUSANDS UPON THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS. AND SO YOU CAN TRY AND NEGOTIATE THAT WITH THEM BUT YOU'RE PAYING FAR MORE IN ADDED NETWORK COVERAGE IN YOUR PAIN IN NETWORK WITH THE CONTRACTED PROVIDER. AND OF COURSE IT'S IN THE PATIENT'S BEST INTEREST TO GO TO CREDENTIAL PROVIDERS WITHIN A NETWORK. AND SO THIS BILL DOES NOT SAY YOU CANNOT CONTINUE TO PAY THOSE PREMIUMS BUT YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO DO SOME -- SOME THINGS TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT PATIENTS PROTECTED DURING HAVE TO LET THEM KNOW WHAT THEIR OPTIONS ARE. AND IF YOU CONTINUE TO PAY THOSE PREMIUMS FOR THEM. YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO MEET THOSE STANDARDS LIKE PAYING FOR A FULL YEAR LEADING THE HEALTH LAN KNOW THAT THAT YOU ARE PAYING THESE THIRD PARTY PAYMENTS. AND THEN AS YOU SAID THEY TAKE THE FINANCIAL INCENTIVE AWAY. BY MAKING SURE THAT THEY'RE GONNA PAY THE MEDICARE RATE. NOT MEDI CAL MEDICARE. SO THAT'S ON THE SUBSTANCE ABUSE SPACE THAT'S THAT THE ANSWER THAT QUESTION WHERE WERE NOT PROHIBITING IT IN FACT THE FIRST SENTENCE OF THIS BILL SAYS YOU HAVE TO ACCEPT THOSE PAYMENTS HEALTH PLANS HEALTH INSURERS. BUT THE FINANCIAL INCENTIVE TO DO THE WRONG THING IS TAKEN AWAY IN THAT AND THEY REQUIRED TO DO THE RIGHT THING BY THE PATIENT IS IS SET OUT IN THE BILL. IT'S A VERY SIMPLE BUILT THAT WAY. THAT HANS I GUESS BUT THE FUNNY IS THAT I DO HAVE IS ABOUT THE RACE SENDING PART OF IT -- HE IT I UNDERSTAND YOU KNOW THE BUSINESS PAR VERSUS THE YOU KNOW A MORE GOVERNMENT RUN THE MIDDLE COMPARING ONE TYPE OF PLAN TO ANOTHER. AND I JUST I'M JUST CONCERNED ABOUT. AND MAYBE SOMEONE CAN RESPOND TO THAT THAT. YOU KNOW WE'RE TALKING IT IF THERE'S A LOT OF PROBLEMS WITH IN A DUMPY PEOPLE ON THE CURB. SHORT TERM YOU KNOW PEOPLE SIGNED UP THINK IN THE GETTING YEAR THEY GET THREE MONTHS OR WHATEVER. AND I'M LOOKING AT THESE AMENDMENTS ON THESE OR WHAT PART. THESE PUT HE HOOKED IT SAYING IN HERE THAT THEY ARE COMMITTING TO PROVIDE PREMIUM ASSISTANCE. FOR A FULL YEAR'S. FOR THE REMAINDER ASSEMBLY MEMBER THOSE ARE PASSED OUT BY THE OPPOSITION I BELIEVE. THOSE ARE NOT THE AMENDMENTS THAT THE COMMITTEE TOOK. SO THAT'S THAT'S WHERE I'M HAVING UNSETTLING. RIGHT NOW WITH THE THE WEIGHT REDUCTION. THINK YOU. IT DID YOU I'M GETTING QUITE WAS YOUR QUESTION. WELL IT'S JUST I MEAN THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS GOING ON THAT ARE WRONG. AND I'M THINKING THERE MIGHT BE OTHER WAYS TO LOOK AT IT AS WELL BESIDES JUST LOOKING AT THAT RATE ISSUE [inaudible] TOM. FEAR ME SUGGESTIONS WERE ALWAYS OPEN TO SUGGESTIONS BUT MAY I MISTER CHAIRMAN MAY I RESPOND. ACTUALLY NOT LISTA UNLESS THE UNLESS THE WITNESS. DO YOU HAVE. YEAH ANY RESPONSE REGARDING THAT. YEAH UP THANKS VERY MUCH AND I'LL BE VERY BRIEF UP THERE ARE WAYS TO CONTROL THESE ISSUES AND THOSE WAYS HAVE A LOT TO DO WITH THEIR NUMBER GUARDRAILS THAT WE HAVE SUGGESTED THAT OTHERS WORTH ETHIC. SUGGESTED AND THAT HAVE BEEN AND IN VARIOUS BROUGH VERSIONS OF THE BILL ALTHOUGH THE GUARDRAIL THAT WE DO IN FACT FOLLOW WE ALSO OPERATE OUR PROGRAM UNDER THE ADVISORY OPINION. FROM THE HHS INSPECTOR GENERAL WHICH WE HAVE DONE FOR THE LAST COUPLE OF DECADES SO THERE ARE THINGS TO TO CONTROL THOSE AND TO MAKE SURE THAT THE ORGANIZATION PROVIDING THE THIRD PARTY IS A ASSISTANCE. IS A YACHT AND INDEPENDENT CHARITY WITH AN INDEPENDENT BOARD WITH NO INTEREST WHATSOEVER IN NAY IN A PROVIDER TO ASSURE THAT CARE IS NOT PROVIDED. US SUPPORT IS NOT PROVIDED ON A SHORT TERM BASIS BUT IT'S PROVIDED ON A FULL PREMIUM YOUR BASIS ALL OF THOSE THINGS TO SHOULD ENSURE THAT THERE IS NOT COST DURING THOSE ARE THINGS THAT WE STRONGLY BELIEVE IN. THAT WE STRONGLY SUPPORT AND WE BELIEVE WOULD ADDRESS MANY OF THE ISSUES HERE WE HAVE BEEN PROMOTING THOSE THINGS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY -- IN MANY STATES IN SUGGESTING THAT. SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE ALWAYS FOLLOW [inaudible] THE QUESTIONS. SENATE I KIND OF FROM LIVING YOUR BILL SINCE BEFORE YOU GOT OUT OF OUR COMMITTEE -- ALL YEARS MATTER FACT -- BUT YOU KNOW THIS BILLS ABOUT PREMIUM ASSISTANCE OF FOR FINANCIALLY FROM FINANCIALLY INTERESTED ENTITIES. STEERING PATIENTS IN THE COVERAGE. THAT HAVE POTENTIAL REIMBURSING AT A HIGHER RATE. WE UNDERSTAND THIS PRACTICE EXISTS. AND THIS BILL ATTEMPTS TO SET SOME PARAMETERS FOR THE PRACTICE. AS IMPORTANT THAT IN DOING SO WE DON'T PLACE A BURDEN ON PATIENTS DISRUPT THEIR CARE. A RESULT IN LAPSING COVERAGES. WITH THESE AMENDMENTS WE REMOVE THE FINANCIAL INCENTIVE TO ENGAGE IN BEHAVIOR THAT TAKES ADVANTAGE OF THE SYSTEM THAT'S THE CORE OF THE AMENDMENTS. I BELIEVE THE AMENDMENT STREAMLINED THE PROCESS WILL NOT PLACE A BURDEN ON PATIENTS PLANS OR REGULATORS. THE AMENDMENTS ALLOW ASSISTANCE TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE BE PROVIDED BY THOSE CHARITIES. THAT HAVE THE PATIENT'S INTERESTS AT HEART. AND ALLOW THESE PATIENTS CONTINUE WITH THEIR COMMERCIAL COVERAGE EVEN THOUGH THEY MAY QUALIFY UNDER MEDI CAL OR MEDICARE. NOTHING PROHIBITS THAT -- AND THAT IS THAT IS THE HEART THAT IS THE HEART OF THE BILL. THE BILL. ENJOYS A DO PASS RECOMMENDATION. YOU'VE ALSO HEARD FROM PEOPLE THAT THEY WANT TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON THAT I WOULD ENCOURAGE THAT -- THIS OF THE DEBATE HAS BEEN VERY ROBUST YOU CAN ONLY IMAGINE HOW IT WILL ROBUST IT WILL BE WHEN HE GETS TO OUR FLOOR. IF. ON THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE -- WITH THAT I WITH BUT WE DO HAVE WE DO NOT HAVE MOTION. WE DO NOT HAVE A PROMOTION. THE SECOND BY MISTER MAYES WITHOUT WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE SENATOR LET ME THINK RESEARCHER. AND I REALLY DO APPRECIATE ALL OF THE HELP THAT YOU AND YOUR COMMITTEE STAFF GAVE US ON THIS BILL.

I SPENT TWENTY YEARS WORKING ON HEALTH CARE FOR YOUR AVERAGE WORKER MAKING SURE THAT THEY HAD ACCESS AND THAT THEY HAD ACCESS AND IT WAS AFFORDABLE. I WOULD NEVER EVER AFTER A BILL THAT WOULD HARM SOMEONE'S ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE BUT WHAT WE ALWAYS RAN UP AGAINST WHEN WE'RE NEGOTIATING THOSE BENEFITS WAR WERE PEOPLE WHO WANT TO MAKE A PROFIT AND THEY WERE MORE WORRIED ABOUT THE PROFIT.

FOURTEEN NINETY FIVE YES SIR THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS THAT THIS IS THE ANNUAL SENATE HEALTH COMMITTEE OMNIBUS BILL WHICH MAKES NON CONTROVERSIAL CHANGES TO VARIOUS PROVISIONS OF HEALTH LAW INCLUDING REVISING THE REPORTING STRUCTURE OF LAW ENFORCEMENT PERSONALITY HOSPITALS. REVISING MENTAL HEALTH SERVICE PERFORMANCE CONTRACT REQUIREMENTS AND MAKING CLEAN UP CHANGES TO TO RECENTLY ENACTED BILLS RECENT AMENDMENTS ADDED LANGUAGE AT THE REQUEST OF THE PART OF A PUBLIC HEALTH TO GIVE THEM THE BELIEVE ISSUE HOSPICE PROVIDER LICENSE BASED ON AN APPLICANT BEING ACCREDITED BY ESTIMATES APPROVED. NATIONAL CREATING ORGANIZATION THE PART PUBLIC HEALTH REQUESTED THIS LANGUAGE BASED ON A GROWING BACKLOG OF HOSPICE PROVIDER LICENSE APPLICATIONS AND HAS RECENTLY IMPLEMENTED SIMILAR PROGRAM FOR HOME HEALTH AGENCIES. AS ALWAYS AS A COMMITTEE BILL ITEMS MUST REMAIN NON CONTROVERSIAL AND THIS LANGUAGE WAS VETTED WITH HOSPICE PROVIDER ORGANIZATIONS OF ANY ENTITY OPPOSES ANYTHING IN THIS BILL THAT CANNOT BE ADDRESSED WITH AMENDMENTS. THAT PROVISION BE REMOVED OR EXPECT WE ASK FOR A KNIFE IT. THANK YOU DOCTOR PAN ANY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT BETSEY ARMSTRONG ON BEHALF OF THE COUNTY HEALTH EXECUTIVES ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT OF THE SPECIFIC PROVISIONS EXTENDING PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY THANK YOU. MELISSA CORTES ROTH ON BEHALF OF MY MEDICS IN SUPPORT OF THE STEM CELL THERAPY PROVISIONS. CHILDREN SCHOOL DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH IN SUPPORT OF THE HOSPICE PROVISIONS. ANY FURTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. MOVING TO OPPOSITION ARE THERE ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. SEE NINE BACK TO A QUESTION TO COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. THIS BIG WELL THANK YOU AND THE DOCTOR AND THAT YOU CAN HELP US THERE'S GONNA CONCERN RAISED ABOUT PROVISIONS IN THIS BILL APPEAR TO BE SUBSTANTIAL AND IN THEIR SUBSTANTIATED. IN THE POLICY CHANGE ON THEY'RE NOT JUST THE NORMAL TECHNICAL -- TYPE OF NON CONTROVERSIAL CHANGES. SHOULDN'T THIS. HAD BEEN ADDRESSED IN A MORE. APPROPRIATE WAY GOING THROUGH THE POLICY COMMITTEE OF PROCESS. MAYBE YOU COULD ADDRESS THAT FOREST'S. SO I GUESS I'LL BE HELPFUL IF YOU COULD INDICATE WHICH PORTION THE BILL YOU FEEL A SUBSTANTIVE OKAY SO IS BEING RELEASED SPECIFIC THE HOSPICE CARE OKAY. IF YOU COULD ADDRESS THAT ON HOW DOES THE DP H. INTEND TO ENSURE QUALITY COMPASSIONATE CARE FOR PEOPLE FACING LIFE. LIMITING ILLNESS AND INJURY INCLUDING EXPERT MEDICAL CARE PAIN MANAGEMENT EMOTIONAL AND SPIRITUAL SUPPORT EXPRESSLY TAILORED. TO THE PATIENT'S NEEDS AND WISHES. THIS SEEMS TO BE A CHANGE IN DEVIATION. FROM THE NORMAL PROCESS BY ADDING SUCH A IN DEPTH OKAY. OKAY SO ACTUALLY -- THAT I KNOW THAT I WILL TALK. I DON'T KNOW THAT THEY AYE I'VE MAY HAVE ACTUALLY -- WE HAVE TO FUND PUBLIC HEALTH ADDRESS ADDRESS THAT TO THE POLICE TO CHANGE [inaudible] PLEASE DO [inaudible] OKAY UP TILL SUGGEST BOTH DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH -- I MAY HAVE MISSED A PART OF YOUR QUESTION SO I DON'T ANSWER FULLY THAT'S WHEN I LET ME KNOW AND THE DEPARTMENT OF BELIEVES THAT THE SAFETY PROTECTIONS ARE STILL INTACT BECAUSE THE ORGANIZATIONS THAT WILL BE PERFORMING THE INITIAL LICENSING A SURVEY. ARE APPROVED BY THE CENTER FOR MEDICARE AND MEDICAID. AND THE CENTER FOR MATTER MEDICARE MEDICAID ONLY APPROVES THOSE. ACCREDITING ORGANIZATIONS THAT STANDARDS MEET THE FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS OR EXCEED THOSE REQUIREMENTS. IN ADDITION THE DEPARTMENT INTENDS TO FULLY WORK WITH THE ACCREDITING ORGANIZATIONS TO ENSURE THAT ANY STATE SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS WE HAVE FOR HOSPICE PROVIDERS [inaudible] ARE ADDRESSED BY THE ACCREDITATION STANDARDS AND IF NOT WE WILL WORK WITH THOSE ACCREDITING ORGANIZATIONS TO MAKE SURE OF THAT. THE FACILITIES MEET THOSE REQUIREMENTS SO HELP US TO UNDERSTAND BECAUSE THE ASSEMBLY HEALTH COMMITTEE ANNOUNCES STATED THAT. AS OF OCTOBER TWENTY FIFTH TWENTY SEVENTEEN THERE WERE SEVENTY TWO HOSPICE APPLICANTS AWAITING INITIAL LICENSE SURVEYS AND IT DEVIATES STATES THAT. IN FACT THEY STATED ON JUNE TWENTIETH SUPPORT A SUPPORT LETTER THAT THE DEVIATES ANTICIPATES THAT THE CONTINUAL GROWTH IN THE NEW OPERATING HOSPICES WILL FURTHER DELAY. WAIT TIMES SO HOW WE HOW DO WE JUSTIFY THIS IN THIS OMNIBUS BILL. AND RECOGNIZE MAYBE. YOU COULD HELP ME UNDERSTAND THAT. SO I IT'S WHY CLARIFY SO THE ISSUE IS IS THAT THE DEFINITIONS INCREASING THE BACKLOG. ONE YES. BY CREATING THE DEFINITION ARE WHERE INCREASING. A NUMBER OF BACKLOGS FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH TO TO NOT BE ABLE. TO FACILITATE MEETING THE NEEDS STILL. SO IN RESPECT TO THE SERVICE. IT'S REALLY ABOUT THE SURVEYS. OKAY SO DAMNED IF I MAY -- THE I KNOW IS NORMALLY THE SHE REAL SIMPLE BILL WE ALL YOU KNOW GATHER AROUND A LOT BUT THIS HAD A SUBSTANTIAL. CHANGES AND SO ON THAT'S WHEN TRYING TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF IT SO THE APPLICANTS WILL STILL GO THROUGH THE REGULAR PAPER APPLICATION PROCESS WHERE THEY'RE REVIEWED BY OUR CENTRALIZED APPLICATIONS UNIT. AND THEN THE PROVIDER HAS THE OPTION TO GO TO ONE OF THESE ACCREDITING BODIES TO RECEIVE A SURVEY. THOSE ACCREDITING BODIES MAY HAVE THE ABILITY. TO AND CONDUCT THE SURVEY AHEAD OF THE SCHEDULE WHERE THE DEPARTMENT NORMALLY WOULD WHERE THEY WOULD BE WAITING IN LINE POTENTIALLY. FOR A COUPLE OF MONTHS TO GET A SURVEY. AND SO WE THINK THAT HAVING THIS OPTION MAY IMPROVE THEIR ABILITY TO BECOME LICENSE. SO ESSENTIALLY WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN AS THEIR HANDS ARE GOING. TO GET FULL AND ARE NOT GONNA BUILD WHAT DO THERE'D THIS SURVEY [inaudible] POTENTIALLY. I AM NOT SURE THIS IS YOUR QUESTION CAME QUE REPEAT THE QUESTION AGAIN SORRY PRICE IT. SO FROM FROM FROM APPEARANCE THINKS IT LOOKS LIKE THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH. WILL PROBABLY HAVE THEIR HANDS FULL AND WON'T BE ABLE. TO REALLY GO OUT AND DO ALL OF THE SURVEYS BECAUSE THERE. THERE'S NOT ENOUGH TO GO AROUND FOR THEM. TO MAKE IT HAPPEN ON A FUNDING NOT ENOUGH ACT. SUPPORT THIS IS SO WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS ACTUALLY A LITTLE -- DECREASE THE BACKLOG I UNDERSTAND YEAH [inaudible] SO -- BUT IT DOESN'T APPEAR THAT THAT'S THE WAY IT'S GONNA HAPPEN. MAYBE HAVE FRAMED THE QUESTION WRONG I AND I APOLOGIZE KNOCKED HIM BUT I IT'S A REAL CONCERN THAT THAT THAT'S THAT'S BEING RAISED SO. OKAY WELL AS AS AS I INDICATED BEFORE MY TESTIMONY -- IF THE YEAH THERE ISN'T OUT AS A COMMITTEE BILL IF THERE IS A PORTION THAT IS -- THAT'S A STICKING POINT WE WILL REMOVE THAT FROM THE BILL -- SO -- SO WE CAN'T TRY TO ADDRESS YOUR CONCERNS ADAM AND THEN -- WILL THEN IF WE WILL LOOK TO REMOVE THAT PROVISION FROM THE BILL I I GUESS WHAT I WOULD SAY IS THAT. WE'RE TRYING TO LIVE REMOVES THE BACKLOG BY GIVING THEM SO WHAT THAT MEANT WHAT THE BILL DOES INCLUDE. IS IS THAT -- THERE IS AN AMEND THEIR BASIC IS LANGUAGE GIVING THE PART PUBLIC HEALTH THE ABILITY TO ISSUE A HOSPICE PROVIDER LICENSE. BASED ON THE FACT THAT BEING CREDITED BY CMS APPROVED NATIONAL TRADING ORGANIZATION THEREFORE THAT THE PART PUBLIC HEALTH -- WOULD BE ABLE TO MORE RAPIDLY -- APPROVE IT BECAUSE THEY CAN THEN THE FOR TO THE CREDITING AGENCY WHICH AGAIN IS A CMS APPROVED ACCREDITING ORGANIZATION AND THAT WOULD -- THEREFORE ALLOW THEM -- TO APPROVED THE MORE QUICKLY WITHOUT HAVING TO SEND THEIR OWN PEOPLE BASICALLY BECAUSE ACCREDITING BODY HAS READY -- ACCREDITED THAT ENTITY. OKAY SO THAT VERY WELL MAY BE THE CRUX OF THE ENTIRE. ISSUE RIGHT THERE. THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH -- INTENDING TO TRANSFER THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES OVER TO A NATIONAL ACCREDITED ORGANISE OKAY AND THAT VERY WELL MAY BE THE ISSUE. OBJECT AT HEART HERE IS THAT WERE ACTUALLY PASSING THAT OFF FROM THE STATE TO A NATIONAL ORGANIZATION. WHICH IS I BELIEVE WE'RE ALL GONNA PROBABLY KNOW MORE ABOUT. OKAY SO -- SO AGAIN IF I'D THAT REMAINS IN ISSUE SAID IT THIS IT THESE ARE CMS APPROVED NATIONAL GRADING BUYS HOWEVER IF THAT IS -- CONTINUES IS THAT IS AN ISSUE FOR FOR YOU AND OTHERS THAT AND WE WILL REMOVE THAT PROVISION FROM THE BILL. OKAY GOTTA HOPEFULLY WE CAN WORK IT OUT. THEY BEAT THAT BUT BEGAN IF IN THE END YOU STILL THE SIDE THAT'S A PROBLEM SO WE MOVED BILL. CRUCIATE THANK YOU. I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE WE GET THIS RIGHT DOUGLASS DR BEN YOUR DOCTOR PAN YOU ARE -- ACTING AS THE AUTHOR ON THIS -- ON THIS YET COMMITTEE ON BILL WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THEM REMOVING LANGUAGE ON THIS BIGELOW AYE ARE YOU OR ARE YOU COMFORTABLE WITH THAT AS IT CURRENTLY SITS ARE YOU SUGGESTING THAT HE'S BEEN LANGUAGE. REMOVED RIGHT NOW WORD OR IS THIS AFTER THIS COMMITTEES DOWN WE CAN CONTINUE TO WORK ON AT THIS POINT. AT THIS POINT I JUST WANTED A CLARIFICATION OKAY I THINK WE WALKED INTO. YOU KNOW A LONG WAY AROUND THE TREE BUT WE GOT TO THE THE P. H.. INTENDING TO TRANSFER TO THE NATIONAL ORGANIZATION I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT'S ON THE RECORD WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE GETS. ADDED AND SO BUT THAT'S A SUBSTANTIAL CHANGE FROM OUTSIDE THE NORM OF WHAT WE'VE DONE IN THE PAST WELL WE'VE WE'VE DONE SIMILAR THINGS LIKE THIS FOR OTHER PROGRAMS LIKE HOME HEALTH AGENCIES SO THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME WE'VE. DONE RIGHT HERE WHERE LONELY SOUND POLICY PRIOR OKAY THAT'S WHAT I'M. TALKING ABOUT IS ONLY THROUGH THE POLICY COMMITTEE OKAY NOT THROUGH THE HONEST. ALRIGHT WELL -- I WILL DEFER TO YOU WHETHER YOU FEEL THAT WE SHOULD REMOVE IT BY THE TIME IT HITS THE FLOOR ARE IF YOU WILL BE COMFORTABLE NOW OF THE DISCUSSION WITH THAT PART OF THE CULT THAT THIS INAPPROPRIATE PEOPLE. SO PLEASE GIVE ME DIRECTIONS TO GET. I I I IF I CAN MR. I'M GOOD WITH THAT WITH A RESPONSE I BELIEVE ANSWER THE QUESTION FOR CLARITY PURPOSES.

TIME THIS IS BILLED BUILD OFF OF AN EFFORT THAT WE HAVE A PREVIOUS LEGISLATION WE RAN IN TWENTY FOURTEEN TO INCREASE DENTAL PLAN TRANSPARENCY IN VALUE. I'M ONE OF THE THINGS ARE MEMBERS HERE FROM THEIR PATIENTS IS THAT THEY DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND THEIR PLAN BENEFITS AND THAT ALSO I'M WHEN THEY'RE IN THE MIDDLE TREATMENT THEY OFTEN DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT THE PLAN IS GOING TO COVER. AND THEN SOMETIMES AFTER THE FACT WHAT THEY'LL BE ON THE HOOK FOR SO WHERE THIS TO PROVISIONS IN THE BILL ONE IS CREATING A STANDARDIZED MATRIX THAT WOULD ALLOW PATIENTS TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THEIR PLAN BENEFITS. AND THE SECOND IS REQUIRING PLANS TO MORE FULLY COMMUNICATE WITH OUT OF NETWORK PROVIDERS SO THAT THEY CAN EDUCATE THEIR PATIENTS ABOUT THE TRUE COST AND WE REALLY APPRECIATE THE WILLINGNESS OF THE DENTAL PLANS TO WORK WITH US WE KNOW IT'S BEEN A LONG PROCESS -- WE ARE TAKING SOME AMENDMENTS I BELIEVE IN COMMITTEE TODAY THAT WOULD REMOVE I'M ONE OF THAT ONE OF THEIR PIECES OF OPPOSITION AND WE'RE GONNA BE WORKING WITH THEM. IN THE FALL ON FURTHER DISCUSSIONS AROUND. THE GOAL OF CDA AND WE THINK THAT THERE'S A POTENTIAL REASONABLE DEAL I THAT WE CAN GET YOU AND ARE HOPEFUL THAT WE CAN HAVE SOME DISCUSSIONS ALTHOUGH DEATHLY NO COMMITMENT THERE -- SO WITH THAT I WOULD JUST URGE YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU. SWEAR TO MAKE SURE THAT YOUR EXCEPT I COMMITTEE RIGHT.

HERSELF IN THE SPONSOR AND SO THE REMOVAL. OF THAT PROVISION WILL GO A LONG WAY TOWARD HELPING US. GET TO A PLACE WHERE WE CAN WORK THROUGH THE REMAINING ISSUES THERE IN THE BILL -- THE DENTAL PLANS OBVIOUSLY SHARE THE INTEREST OF THE DENTISTS TO MAKE SURE THAT CONSUMERS UNDERSTAND HOW THEIR COVERAGE WORKS AND SO WE THINK WITH SOME ADDITIONAL DISCUSSIONS WE CAN GET THERE AND RESOLVE OR REMEDIATE ISSUES.

OKAY THANK YOU -- MISTER VICE CHAIR. LIKE COLLEAGUES I'M PRESENTING A SPEED TEN FORTY FIVE TODAY -- WHICH IS -- A CONSERVATORSHIP DEL -- TO HELP US SOME OF THE MOST ARE DEBILITATED AND OUR PEOPLE ON OUR STREETS -- TO TO MENTAL ILLNESS AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE DISORDER ARE GOING TO START BY THANKING THE THAT CHAIR DOES NOT HERE AND AUDIT COMMITTEE STAFF ARE FOR WORKING WITH US -- AS WELL AS WITH THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE WE ALL WORK TOGETHER ON AMENDMENTS -- AND I DO ACCEPT THOSE AMENDMENTS ON I BELIEVE WILL BE ADOPTING THEM IN THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE. OF LATER THIS WEEK -- SO THANK YOU FOR THAT. ON THIS BILL -- IS IS REALLY ABOUT A SMALL US SUBSET OF OUR HOMELESS POPULATION NO ON OUR STREETS NOT JUST IN SAN FRANCISCO -- BUT IN LOS ANGELES AND FRANKLY IN OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE ALTHOUGH THIS BILL IS LIMITED -- TO SAN FRANCISCO AND LOS ANGELES IS A PILOT PROGRAM WHO ARE UNRAVELLING AND AND UNFORTUNATE DYING. PEOPLE HER SEVERELY DRUG ADDICTED -- SEVERELY MENTALLY ILL ARE IN SO ALTHOUGH WE ALL WANT TO SEE MORE ON SERVICES OFFERED HOUSING. TREATMENT -- TOTALLY IN FAVOR OF THAT -- YOU THESE ARE PEOPLE YOU CAN'T REACH SIMPLY BY OFFERING SERVICES AYE AND RIGHT NOW. NOW THE TOOLS THAT ARE COUNTIES HAVE -- UNDER THE LPS ARE AYE INSUFFICIENT TO REGION'S POPULATION IN FOR TYPICALLY. FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE -- ADDICTED -- THEY GOT HELD IN A SEVENTY TWO HOUR HOLD AND BY THE END OF THE SEVENTY TWO HOURS WHEN THEY GO BEFORE A JUDGE -- THEY SEEM SOBER AND NORMAL AND THE JUDGE SAYS WELL THERE'S NO BASIS TO HOLD THIS PERSON SEEMS FINE TO ME -- AND NEVER MIND THAT THEY'VE BEEN FIFTY ONE FIFTY FIVE OR SIX OR SEVEN TIMES IN THE LAST YEAR. AND SO WHAT ENDS UP HAPPENING THESE PEOPLE ARE THEY DO END UP GETTING CONSERVE. BUT IT'S CALLED IT'S A DIFFERENT KIND OF CONSERVATORSHIP CALLED JAIL BECAUSE THEY END UP CYCLING THROUGH THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. OTHER FIRST THEIR MAIN INTERACTIONS WITH POLICE OFFICERS NOTS NOT. WHAT WE WANT TO HAVE HAPPEN PEOPLE CONSTANTLY INTERACTING WITH POLICE OFFICERS? GOING TO JAIL GETTING THEIR TREATMENT IN JAIL WE WANT TO GIVE PEOPLE A DIFFERENT CITING. AND THIS TOOL OF WHICH WILL ALLOW. PLACE PEOPLE INTO A CONSERVATORSHIP UNDER VERY NARROW CIRCUMSTANCES IN TERMS OF LOOKING AT THEIR TRACK RECORD HOW MANY TIMES HAVE THEY BEEN. FIFTY ONE FIFTY EIGHT OF FOR EXAMPLE -- THEIR DIAGNOSIS THEIR INABILITY CARE FOR THEMSELVES. I'D THE BILL RETAINS ALL OF THE STRONG DUE PROCESS PROTECTIONS ARE CURRENTLY IN OUR CONSERVATIVE SHIP LAWS YOU I HAVE TO GO BEFORE A JUDGE. UNION TRIAL BY JURY -- YOU GOT A RIGHT TO AN ATTORNEY IN SAN FRANCISCO WE PROVIDE A FULL PUBLIC DEFENDER -- AND YOU GET PERIODIC A REVIEW EYES YOU KNOW THERE'S AN ESCALATION IN TERMS OF THE PEER TIME IT NEVER IS MORE. ABOUT IN ONE YEAR BY THE BILL HAS BEEN -- AMENDED OVERTIME AS HAS ASSEMBLYMAN AYE SANTIAGO'S WERE WE'RE BOTH ON THIS PARALLEL TRACK AND LOTS OF AMENDMENTS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE REALLY PROVIDING WRAPAROUND SERVICES -- WHETHER WE WANT TO USE I LEAST RESTRICT -- WE HAVE PEOPLE WHO ARE CONSERVE TO LIVING IN SUPPORT OF HOUSING IS NOT JUST ABOUT PUTTING EVERYONE. IN A LOCKED FACILITY THAT MAY BE NECESSARY FOR SOME PEOPLE BUT THE PREFERENCE THE STRONG PREFERENCE I IS TO HAVE PEOPLE IN. MY SUPPORT OF HOUSING AND OF COURSE THE ULTIMATE GOAL IS TO GET PEOPLE HEALTHY AGAIN -- IT'S NOT HUMANE OR PROGRESSIVE. TO HAVE PEOPLE DYING ON OUR STREETS AND TO JUST WALK BY AND SAY WELL IT WOULD BE GREAT IF WE COULD DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. WERE TRYING TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT -- SAN FRANCISCO AND LOS ANGELES ARE BOTH COMING TO THIS LEGISLATURE ASKING FOR THESE TOOLS THERE OTHER COUNTIES INTERESTED AS WELL. AND THE ORIGINAL BILL DID INCLUDE ALL FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES IT'S BEEN NARROWED TO TWO COUNTIES IN THE PILOT PROGRAM. AYE IT'S A GOOD BILL AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR I DON'T. WITH ME TODAY ARE KELLEHER MOTO NAM WHO IS THE DIRECTOR OF TRANSITIONS FROM SAN FRANCISCO TO PART IN PUBLIC HEALTH. AND JILL NELSON -- WHO IS THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF PROGRAMS AFTER THE SAN FRANCISCO DEPARTMENT OF AGING? ADULT SERVICES THANK YOU THANK YOU. WHEN IT'S IN SUPPORT? I'M JOHN YELTSIN AND DEPUTY DIRECTOR PROGRAMS THE DEPARTMENT OF AGING ADULT SERVICE SAYS OUR DEPARTMENT OPERATE SAN FRANCISCO'S OFFICE OF THE PUBLIC SENATOR WIENER FOR HIS LEADERSHIP ON THIS REALLY IMPORTANT ISSUE AND THANK ALL OF YOU FOR YOUR TIME TODAY -- SAVVY AS YOU'VE HEARD SP TEN FORTY FIVE WOULD CREATE AN OPTIONAL NEW CONSERVATORSHIP TO SERVE OUR MOST AT RISK RESIDENTS THOSE EXPERIENCING MENTAL ILLNESS AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER. LIMITING AND ADULTS CIVIL LIBERTIES IS A SERIOUS MATTER AND CONSERVATORSHIP IS ABSOLUTELY CONSIDERED TO BE AN INTERVENTION OF LAST RESORT. BUT THE FACT REMAINS THAT THERE IS A SMALL SUBSET OF OUR POPULATION THAT FACE. PROFOUND CHALLENGES OUT AND THEY'RE NOT ABLE TO ENGAGE IN SERVICES ON A VOLUNTARY BASIS. WE SEE THEIR HEALTH DETERIORATE WITH EACH CRISIS S. B. TEN FORTY FIVE WOULD OFFER US A WAY TO HELP BREAK THE CYCLE OF STREETS HOSPITALS IN JAIL A CYCLE THAT ABSOLUTELY DOES NOT. FACILITATE OR PROMOTE THEIR RECOVERY. WE BELIEVE THAT THE PROVISIONS IN SB TEN FORTY FIVE WOULD PROVIDE US WITH A TOOL THAT CAN HELP TO SAVE THE LIVES OF PEOPLE. THAT CANNOT ACCESS HELP TO OUR CURRENT LAWS. THE LPS ACTS IN LAURA'S LAW OR ASSISTED OUTPATIENT TREATMENT BOTH HAVE NARROW ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA. AND NEITHER CONSIDER SUBSTANCE USE EXCEPT FOR ALCOHOL AS A SPECIFIC CONTRIBUTOR TO GRAY DISABILITY. THE REALITY IS THOUGH THAT ON THE STREETS TODAY. METHAMPHETAMINES AND HARRY DRUGS ARE RAVAGING OUR STREETS AS SUCH WE HAVE INDIVIDUALS OR TWO ELDER ACCEPT VOLUNTARY SERVICES UNDER LAURA SAW. BUT THEY DON'T PRESENT WITH THE OVERWHELMING LEVEL OF DISABILITY REQUIRED TO SATISFY THE LPS INVOLUNTARY HOLDS ESPECIALLY ONCE THEY'VE BEEN IN THE HOSPITAL FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS. BECAUSE SUBSTANCE USE A MENTAL ILLNESS OR CHRONIC CONDITIONS IT'S ACTUALLY POSSIBLE THAT THE DIFFERENT POSSESS PROVISIONS. IS LARA'S LAW LPS IN S. B. TEN FORTY FIVE CONSERVATORSHIP COULD SERVE THE SAME INDIVIDUAL BUT AT DIFFERENT POINTS IN TIME. WE THINK THAT S. B. TEN FORTY FIVE WOULD HELP TO FILL A GAP. AND WE SEE A REAL OPPORTUNITY TO HELP STABILIZE PEOPLE WHO ARE IN CRISIS AND HELP THEM TO ACCESS SERVICES THAT THEY MAY NOT BE AWARE THAT THEY ACTUALLY NEED. AND WE STAND READY TO PROVIDE THEM WITH SERVICE RICH HOUSING IN PLACEMENT -- A WE DO DISAGREE WITH THE SUGGESTION THAT S. B. TEN FORTY FIVE WOULD GREATLY EXPAND. THE POTENTIAL NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS WHO WOULD BE UNDER A CONSERVATORSHIP WE FEEL THAT WE WOULD BE -- USING THE VERY NARROW ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA IN SP. TEN FORTY FIVE TO REACH THE INDIVIDUALS -- WHO WE ACTUALLY ALREADY KNOW BECAUSE THEY ARE IN OUR DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH SYSTEMS AND OUR -- CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEMS. SO WE SUPPORT THE NARROW ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA SP TEN FORTY FIVE PROPOSES AND WE REALLY APPRECIATE THE SAFEGUARDS IN PROTECTIONS. THAT WOULD SUPPORT AN INDIVIDUAL'S RIGHT TO CONTEST CONSERVATORSHIP WITH LEGAL REPRESENTATION. SOME HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE THANK YOU. IN SHARING TRAIN MEMBERS MY NAME IS KELLY HOW ABOUT ON I'M THE DIRECTOR TRANSITIONS AT THE SARASOTA PART OF PUBLIC HEALTH. MY TEAM IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PROVIDING APPROPRIATE PLACEMENT FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE PLACED ON CONSERVATORSHIP SO WE DO NOT HAVE A PLACE TO GO AFTER LEAVING THE HOSPITAL. AS YOU'VE HEARD S. B. TEN FORTY FIVE IS INTENDED. THESE INDIVIDUALS ARE NOW BUT A SYSTEM OF CARE BUT ARE CURRENTLY HARD TO REACH I'D LIKE TO OFFER AN EXAMPLE OF WHO THAT MIGHT BE. MR JOHNSON IS A FIFTY SIX YEAR OLD MAN WITH A LONG HISTORY WITHIN THE CITY SYSTEM OF CARE BUT ONLY WITH CRISIS SERVICES ARE JAIL. IN THE PAST YEAR HE HAS BEEN BROUGHT TO PS FIFTEEN TIMES HE HAS HAD TEN ENCOUNTERS WITH THE SAN FRANCISCO POLICE DEPARTMENT. HE IS KNOWN TO BE HOMELESS HAS A MAJOR DEPRESSION DIAGNOSIS IS NOT ENGAGE IN ANY TREATMENT SERVICES ARE BEING OFFERED ANY CURRENT HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES BECAUSE OF ITS ACT OF SUBSTANCE ABUSE. METHAMPHETAMINE USE IS OBSERVED AS A PRIMARY ISSUE DURING HIS PS VISITS IN AFTER A TWELVE HOUR STAY HE TENDS TO CLEAR UP ENOUGH TO NO LONGER MEET MEDICAL NECESSITY IN ITS RELEASED. HE RETURNS TO PS LATER THAT WEEK HAVING THEN PICKED UP BY THE POLICE FOR BEING UNDER THE INFLUENCE ADDRESSING IN PUBLIC IN EXITING AGGRESSIVE BEHAVIORS TOWARDS OTHERS ON THE STREET. HE ONCE AGAIN CLEARS AFTER AN OVERNIGHT STAY IN IS RELEASED IN THE MORNING BECAUSE HE NO LONGER MEETS GAVE DISABILITY CRITERIA SITTING YOU WILL GO TO SAINT ANTHONY'S FOR LUNCH AND WE'LL GO TO THE SHELTER AFTER THAT TO WAIT FOR A BED. WHEN HE IS DISCHARGED HE STARTS OUT FOR SAINT AND SAINT ANTHONY'S BUT ENDS UP LOOKING FOR DRUGS ON THE WAY? AND FORTUNATELY I COULD SHARE MORE EXAMPLES LIKE THIS INCLUDING ONES OF AGING INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER AND OTHER CONDITIONS LIKE DIABETES OR HIV. SERVICES GOES A LONG HISTORY OF PROVIDING COMPASSIONATE CARE FONG A COVER GRANTED MODEL. RECENTLY WE STARTED AN INTER AGENCY WORKING GROUP TO CREATE CARE PLANS FOR THE FORTY TO FIFTY OF OUR HIGHEST UTILIZE YEARS OF MULTIPLE SYSTEMS. SOME AMONG THIS GROUP HAVE BEEN KNOWN TO THE CITY FOR YEARS AND WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO HELP THEM. STABILIZE NOT BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T TRIED THAT BECAUSE THEIR ABILITY FOR SELF CARE IS DETERIORATED OVER TIME AND VOLUNTARY SERVICES ARE HARDER AND HARDER FOR THEM TO ACCEPT. FOR THEM IT'S BECOME FREE FIVE CAN BE A PATH TO STABILITY HOUSING IN A VASTLY IMPROVED QUALITY OF LIFE THANK YOU AND HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU OTHERS AND SUPPORT. MISTER CHAIRMAN WAS ALEX HAWTHORN CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION HERE IN SUPPORT. MISTER CHAIRMAN THERE'S MORE ASSEMBLE WHICH I OR ANTI ON BEHALF OF MAYOR GARCETTI IN THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES AND THE CITY OF SANTA MONICA AND SPORT. SECURE. NICOLE WATERMAN ON BEHALF OF THE ORANGE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS AND SUPPORT. SO ANYONE IN OPPOSITION MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS SUCKER CHILD DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF A COALITION OF MENTAL HEALTH ADVOCATES. HEALTH ADVOCATES -- AND CIVIL RIGHTS ADVOCATES DO UP UNFORTUNATELY IN REGRETFULLY OPPOSE THIS BILL -- WITH THAT BEING SAID I WOULD I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT. THE A I THINK THE COMMITTEE CONSULTANT OF THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS REALLY DRILL DOWN TO WHAT ARE THE SIGNIFICANT ISSUES THAT WE'VE HAD. IN ARE CONCERNED WITH THIS BILL OUR OPPOSITION REMAINS BECAUSE INVOLUNTARY EXPANSION OF INVOLUNTARY CARE IS GOING DIRECTLY COUNTER TO WHERE WE'VE BEEN FOR THE LAST TWENTY THIRTY YEARS. ON MOVING MORE DIRECTLY INDIVIDUALS OUT OF INSTITUTIONS AND INTO A COMMUNITY BASED SETTINGS FROM COMMUNITY BASED CARE WHEN WE START IMPOSING AGAIN INVOLUNTARY CARE. YEAH OF PROVISIONS WE END UP GOING IN THE WRONG DIRECTION -- BUT I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT THE AMENDMENT TO THAT HAVE BEEN PROPOSED HERE NARROW I THINK THE STANDARD AND THE REST THAT ARE OPPOSE THAT YOU WILL PULL INTO THOSE. PERSONS WHO -- WOULD BE MORE BROADLY DEFINED AND NOT NECESSARILY -- REQUIRED TO BE -- ENVELOPED IN HELD. AND AT ADDITIONALLY WHAT IS CENTRAL -- TO OUR POSITION IS THAT IF WE ARE PULLING INDIVIDUALS AND ON THE INVOLUNTARY HOLDS THAT THAT HAS TO BE TIED DIRECTLY TO SERVICES. WE HAVE IN MANY MANY PLACES -- INCLUDING THIS A. B. A MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM THAT IS FAILING INDIVIDUALS. AND TO PUT MORE PEOPLE INTO THAT SYSTEM IS THE WRONG DIRECTION WE NEED TO BUILD THAT BACK AND FOR INDIVIDUAL SO THAT THOSE SERVICES ARE AVAILABLE -- FOR THEM AND WHEN I SAY SERVICES THAT IS SUPPORTIVE HOUSING LOCATED IN THE COMMUNITY -- IT WRAPAROUND SERVICES -- AVAILABLE FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS PHYSICAL CARE AND MENTAL HEALTH AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CARE -- FOR FOR THEM IF THOSE ARE -- ASSURED TO THESE INDIVIDUALS WE BELIEVE THAT THAT THEN BECOMES PROGRESS IN TREATING THE THE INDIVIDUALS THAT I THINK -- THE AUTHOR AND THE SPONSORS OF THIS BILL ARE SEEKING -- TO PROVIDE FOR THANK YOU. GOOD EVENING CHEN FLOYER IS WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY I TOO WOULD LIKE TO ACKNOWLEDGE -- THE PROGRESS THAT HAS BEEN MADE IN THE AMENDMENTS WERE PARTICULARLY GRATEFUL TO SEE WHAT WE THOUGHT OF OR INCENTIVES TO CONTINUE ARRESTING PEOPLE LIVING ON THE STREETS AND SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE FELT TAT WORK. THAT COULD HAVE. UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES THE AMENDMENTS SEEM TO BE ADDRESSING THOSE -- AND WE ALSO DO APPRECIATE THE ADDITIONAL DUE PROCESS PROTECTIONS -- AND THE INTENT TO LINK PEOPLE TOWARD SERVICES WE DO REMAIN OPPOSED MAINLY BECAUSE WE JUST YOU KNOW THE PROMISES OF DE INSTITUTIONALIZATION TO PROVIDE COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES AND THE PROMISES OF THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT. JUST HAVE NEVER BEEN FULLY FULFILLED. PLACE WERE STILL GOING TO BE CREATING THE SITUATIONS BUT WE WE ARE APPRECIATIVE OF THE MOVEMENT THAT HAS HAPPENED WITH THIS BILL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OTHERS IN OPPOSITION. PLAIN X. CALIFORNIA THE DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA LINES RETIRED AMERICANS OF STRONG UP CLOSE. AND AS A CLIENT. I OPPOSE. HIGHLY STRUNG WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF SOCIAL REHABILITATION AGENCIES IN OPPOSITION. KIMBERLY CHANNEL BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA PAN ETHNIC HEALTH NETWORK WE DO HAVE A OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED -- POSITION RIGHT NOW WE LOOK FORWARD TO REVIEWING THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS IN DETAIL AND APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATIONS THAT HAVE -- OCCURRED THIS FOR THANK YOU PICK YOU. JERRY BROWN AROUND BEHALF SEIU CALIFORNIA -- IN. YEAH OPPOSE WITH OUR ALLIES THINK [inaudible] ANYONE ELSE [inaudible] AFFORDABLE. CENTER APPRECIATE YOU BRINGING THIS UP IT'S A IT'S TIME THAT WE DO SOMETHING AND ONE OF OUR COUNTIES AND IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY STANISLAUS COUNTY IS ACTUALLY. BEEN VERY ACTIVE AND ADDRESSING THIS HOMELESS POPULATIONS I WOULD LOVE TO CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION ON PROUD TO SUPPORT THIS BILL TODAY AND TING TING IN THE CONVERSATION. TRYING YOU MAY BE RURAL STANISLAUS COUNTY INVOLVED IN THIS IS ALSO APPRECIATE VERY MUCH. I THANK YOU AND AND STANISLAUS COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS THIS ACTUALLY IDEA OF I THINK ORIGINATED -- THEY WERE INVOLVED IN THEN WE HAVE THAT ON MOVIE AND SAN FRANCISCO -- THEY DID SEND A LETTER ASKING TO BE INCLUDED THE BILL STARTED IS IMMENSE WITH ALL FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES -- SENATOR JACKSON AYE ASSETS TO NARROW ITS TO COUNTIES WE DID -- I THINK THAT THERE ARE AYE. PERSONALLY I THINK ANY COUNTY THAT ONCE OFTEN IF THEY'RE ABLE TO OFFER THE SERVICES AND MAKE CERTAIN SHOWINGS. THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO SO I'M OPEN TO TRYING TO RESOLVE OUT BY STANISLAUS COUNTY WILL NEED TO GO. BUY MORE ACTIVE THROUGH ITS NUMBERS TO MAKE THOSE REQUESTS SUCH. ALL I DON'T THINK THE AUTHOR BECAUSE HE HE AND I HAVE BEEN WORKING ON THIS ISSUE FROM FROM DIFFERENT HOUSES FOR DEBATE AND IT'S LIKE A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT BUT NOT REMIND. THE COMMITTEE THAT WHEN WE'VE SUPPORT OUR BILL HOW NOW MY BILLS HAD THE SAME FATE ON THE ON THE OP ON THE OTHER HOUSE WHERE IT'S BEEN NARROWED TO ONE COUNTY THIS AFTERNOON I UNDERSTAND IT'S BEEN NEARLY DID NOW TO COUNTIES -- SAN FRANCISCO LOS ANGELES BUT I THINK IT'S A WORTHWHILE CONVERSATION AND I'VE MET WITH THE OPPOSITION -- BRIEFLY HOW MY WAY OUT FROM THE LAST MEETING. AND THERE IS AMERICA ARGUING ABOUT PEOPLE HAVING SERVICES -- TODAY. BUT IT MAY BE A STRETCH TO FIND BETTER LANGUAGE WHEN A JUDGE OR A COURT IS CONSIDERING. A CONSERVATIVE BECAUSE EVERY THERE'S EVERY EFFORT AND WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO AND WHAT I THINK I HEARD -- MISTER A WINNER PRESENT -- THERE'S EVERY EFFORT THAT THIS PROCESS GET SOMEBODY TO A BETTER LIFE. AND THAT'S THE MORE HUMANE THING TO DO I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE CAN'T LOSE IN THIS PROCESS AND I I I WON'T REPEAT THIS THOUGH THE LONG SPEECH ENABLED WE TALKED ABOUT A KAZOO IT'S IT'S DIFFICULT. TO DIFFICULT SUBJECT THAT THINK THAT YOU CAN PICK SOMEBODY UP AGAINST THEIR OWN WILL BUT IT BUT AT THE VERY END OF THE DAY. IT IS ABSOLUTELY THE MORE HUMANE THING TO DO THAN TO WATCH -- SOMEBODY POTENTIALLY DIE ON THE STREET -- THERE ARE LITERALLY PEOPLE ON THE STREETS AND AND I I I I KNOW YOU KNOW THIS BUT THEY WHO. HAVE NO TOES. OR FEET OR RAPED [inaudible] AND YOU TO TURN A BLIND EYE AND NOT CHALLENGE THE CURRENT LAWS. IT IS ABSOLUTELY IN HUMANE ARM. ALL BE OF STOP NOW GENERAL. MAKING A LOT MEETING LONGER BUT I CANNOT EMPHASIZE ENOUGH HOW MUCH WE NEED TO CHALLENGE -- THE LAWS THAT WE HAVE TODAY BECAUSE THEY'VE RESULTED IN SOME PRETTY HORRIFIC -- OUTCOMES AND WHEN WE HAVE THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY EIGHT HUNDRED PEOPLE DIED AND I CAN'T GIVE YOU THE EXACT NUMBER OF THE PEOPLE WHO WANT TO BENEFIT FROM THIS LAW. BUT EIGHT HUNDRED PEOPLE DIED ON THE STREETS LAST YEAR ALONE. IN THE END I GUESS AND AND I GOT IMAGINE THAT THERE ARE. THERE ARE PLENTY OF EXAMPLES THAT WE KNOW IN EACH OF OUR DISTRICTS. I WISH IT WERE STATEWIDE. ARM AYE I WISH IT WAS MORE AGGRESSIVE QUITE FRANKLY. OF THE IN THE SENSE THAT THE IN THE SENSE OF GETTING PEOPLE TOWARDS A BETTER RECOVERY BUT ALSO REMIND PEOPLE THAT. THAT THERE'S NOTHING THAT STOPS THIS FROM BE. UP PROCESS WHERE THEY END UP IN SOMEBODY'S HOME -- IF IT WAS YOUR CHILD. IF IT WAS YOUR UNCLES YOUR MOTHER. WHEN YOU WANT TO FIGHT FOR THEM AND BE ABLE TO PICK THEM OFF THE STREET BRING AMEND YOUR HOME AND DO EVERYTHING YOU POSSIBLY COULD? TIM. SO THAT THEY HAVE A HEALTHY HAPPY AND PRODUCTIVE LIFE. AND I THINK THAT WHAT WE'RE WAITING HERE AND IT'S A CHALLENGE BUT WE'VE GOT TO DO THIS. FISA NOT SUPPORT YOUR EFFORTS. I'LL MAKE IT QUICK AYE TO ISSUES GOING STATEWIDE I'M WHO WE'VE HAD NUMEROUS CONVERSATIONS WITH FAMILIES AND THEY'RE JUST BEING TORN APART AND NOT KNOWING WHAT TO DO WITH A LOVED. ONE AND THEY'VE TRIED EVERY AVENUE FOR CONSERVATORSHIP SO I'M HOPING WE CAN GET ON TRACK WITH THIS HOPE THIS WORKS -- AND YOU KNOWIF YOU CAN OFTEN OTHER COUNTIES OR LET THEM DO THAT THAT BE GREAT. THANK YOU. THANK I WOULD SAY IS THERE IS. TIME REMAINING OF MEMBERS ADVOCATE [inaudible] YOU KNOW. IT IF I IF IT'S JUST ME THEN. IT'S IT'S HARDER BUT OF PEOPLE FROM DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE STATE GRAVITATING IT'S MORE POWERFUL. BUT THANK YOU FOR THAT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN -- YOU KNOW WAS AS MR SANTIAGO SAYING AND IT'S ABOUT THE DIGNITY. AND THE MANATEE OF THESE PEOPLE ON IT'S JUST SEEMS LIKE. THERE'S MORE AND MORE AND I WAS JUST IN SAN FRANCISCO. ON FRIDAY AND YOU KNOW I HADN'T BEEN THERE IN THE VERY LONG TIME. SHOCKED TO SEE. THE FOLKS OUT ON THE STREET AND YOU KNOW I SEE IT IN SAN DIEGO BUT I'M NOT IN THE CITY'S AREA MORE RURAL AREAS SO I DON'T GET. TO SEE YOU KNOW AS MUCH BOMB. WHAT YOU SAID ABOUT THESE? YOU KNOW PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING THROUGH THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM TIME AND TIME AND TIME AND TIME AND TIME AGAIN -- I WISH I HAD THE CHART I DIDN'T KNOW THIS WOULD COME UP BUT I HAVE A CHART THAT SHOWS HOW MUCH ALL THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF TREATMENTS AND HOUSING IN THINGS BECAUSE VERSUS INCARCERATION WITCHES [inaudible] DOLLARS MORE [inaudible] PATIENT. AND THAT'S YOU KNOW THAT'S WHERE WE'RE SPENDING MONEY WHEN WE SHOULD BE HELPING PEOPLE GET INTO HOUSING GET AND HAVE SOMEONE WHO CAN ACTUALLY SPEAK FOR THEM -- YOU KNOW WHICH IS WHAT YOUR BILL DOES -- BUT I DID HAVE SOME QUESTIONS FOR CLARIFICATION IF I MIGHT PHAM. SO HOW HOW DO YOU IDENTIFY PEOPLE WHO WOULD QUALIFY FOR THE CONSERVATORSHIP. AND HOW ARE THEY MONITORED HOW HAS THE DUE PROCESS PROTECTED WE KNOW SAN FRANCISCO YOU KNOW DOES A GOOD JOB WITH. WITH CIVIL LIBERTIES AND YEAH HOW WOULD THAT TRANSLATE INTO HOW YOU ACTUALLY. DEVELOP THE CONSERVATIVE SHIP PROGRAM AND WHAT YOU LOOK. FOR SO ARE MAYOR ELECT BONE MARROW LOOKED BREED HAS ACTUALLY SUBMITTED A A LOCAL ORDINANCE -- IT'S THE MENTAL HEALTH CARE COORDINATION PILOT PROGRAM AND THIS ORDINANCE WOULD ESSENTIALLY ESTABLISH A MULTI DISCIPLINARY TEAM -- IT WOULD CODIFY A MULTI DISCIPLINARY TEAM IS NOT TO SAY THAT WE DON'T HAVE OTHER MULTI DISCIPLINARY TEAMS ALREADY IN EXISTENCE. THROUGH THAT TEAM WE WOULD BE WORKING -- THROUGH A MULTI DEPARTMENTAL AND ALSO INCLUDING LAW ENFORCEMENT AND LAUNCH THE PARK POLICE. FOR A BAY AREA RAPID TRANSIT FOR PEOPLE FAMILIAR WITH OUR TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM -- THE POLICE THAT A LOT OF OUR HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS THAT HAVE ACUMINATE MAY ACTUALLY BE RESIDING DOWN ON THE PART TUNNELS -- SO BRINGING THAT GROUP TOGETHER SO THAT WE CAN IDENTIFY THOSE INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE COMING INTO OUR SYSTEMS THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH BE THE PRIMARY SYSTEM -- AND IN TRYING TO COORDINATE OURS IS STRATEGIES AND INTERVENTIONS IS SO THAT WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT IF WE ARE MOVING TOWARDS CONSERVATORSHIP. THAT WE HAVE ATTEMPTED EVERY OTHER INTERVENTION FIRST ON A VOLUNTARY BASIS AND THAT WOULD BE INCLUDING LOOKING AT ASSISTED OUTPATIENT TREATMENT TO SEE THAT THAT WOULD BE. IF THAT'S APPROPRIATE -- AND SO THESE ARE GONNA O. GENERALLY SPEAKING INDIVIDUALS THAT WE KNOW BECAUSE WE ARE TRACKING THEM AS ARE COMING INTO OUR PSYCHIATRIC EMERGENCY ROOM. INTO OUR AND A MERGER WELL ISSUES WERE TRACKING THEM AS THEY'RE COMING INTO OUR JAIL IN THEIR BE TREATED BY JAIL PSYCHIATRY -- ENDS IT WE ARE WORKING TO COORDINATE OUR INFORMATION SHARING TO TO BETTER. BETTER INTERVENE EL STRATEGICALLY AND IN A MORE TIMELY MANNER SO IN TERMS THE DUE PROCESS QUESTION -- EVERY ARE PROPOSED CONSERVANCY WOULD HAVE A PUBLIC DEFENDER -- ASSIGNED TO THEM AND THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO REQUEST A JURY TRIAL -- OUR OFFICE THE OFFICE OF THE PUBLIC CONSERVATIVE WOULD BE DOING IT AND THOROUGH INVESTIGATION REALLY NEED TO PRESENT TO THE COURT. ON THE ARRAY OF ISSUES THAT ARE LISTED IN THE SP TEN FORTY FIVE AND PART OF OUR BURDEN WOULD BE TO DEMONSTRATE TO THE COURT THAT WE HAVE EXHAUSTED EVERY OTHER POSSIBLE ALTERNATIVE. THAT COULD BE CONSIDERED ON A VOLUNTARY BASIS [inaudible] OKAY -- AND WE KNOW YOU KNOW SOMETIMES LAWS LAW ISN'T ENOUGH -- CAN YOU EXPLAIN WHY YOU KNOW THE A OR T. PROCESS DOESN'T HELP THE POPULATION WE'RE TRYING TO HELP. SO LOWER IF YOU THINK ABOUT -- THESE THREE TYPES OF CONSERVATORSHIP SERVICES ON A SPECTRUM -- YOU CAN THINK OF THE LAURA'S LA ASSISTED OUTPATIENT TREATMENT ON THE BOARD VOLUNTARY SIDE OF THE SPECTRUM. SO ASSISTED OUTPATIENT TREATMENT YOU SINCE SAN FRANCISCO IMPLEMENTED IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN WE HAVE ASSISTED NINETY FOUR INDIVIDUALS ONLY THIRTEEN OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS ACTUALLY REQUIRED IS TO GO TO COURT AND GET PETITIONS FROM THE COURT. THROUGH THAT PROCESS WE ARE GENERALLY SPEAKING ENGAGING INDIVIDUALS ON A VOLUNTARY BASIS. AND AGAIN THE LAURA'S LAW IS -- A LESS RESTRICTIVE FORM -- INSISTED OUTPATIENT TREATMENT IT DOES NOT ALLOW US TO PROVIDE FOR IT INPATIENT TREATMENT WHEN THAT MIGHT BE REQUIRED. AND SO WITH S. B.. TEN FORTY FIVE IF IMPATIENT -- PLACEMENT IS THE MOST APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF PLACEMENT. THEN WE WOULD HAVE THE ABILITY TO TO DEMONSTRATE A REQUEST THAT AUTHORITY FROM THE COURT WHERE YOU DON'T HAVE THAT WITH THE ASSISTED OUTPATIENT TREATMENT OR LAURA'S LA. WELL IT'S ACTUALLY NAM -- ENCOURAGING TO HEAR FROM. REAL WORLD MORE REAL WORLD PRACTITIONERS WHO ARE OUT ON THE STREET. YOU KNOW TRYING TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN PEOPLE'S LIVES WHO. ARE. JUST IN SUCH A OF THE DEVASTATING PLACE -- YOU KNOW THAT YOU DEAL WITH PEOPLE ON A DAILY BASIS. AND KNOW WHAT KIND OF TREATMENT THEY NEED ITEM WE WILL WINS AND REALIZE HOW INVOLVED IT WAS SO. THANK YOU [inaudible] THE X.. TO ANYONE ELSE. THERE IS ONE THANK YOU. FOR TACKLING THIS THEN THIS INCREDIBLY COMPLICATED TOPIC AND AND YOUR YOUR DILIGENCE IN AND TRYING TO MOVE A SOLUTION FORWARD. I THINK I THINK WE'VE MADE TREMENDOUS PROGRESS NIGHT SOUNDS LIKE THEY'RE STILL STILL SOME OUTSTANDING ISSUES AND I APPRECIATE YOU APPRECIATE THAT I KNOW THAT YOU'LL CONTINUE WORKING WORKING WITHOUT -- THE BILL DOES ENJOY DO PASS RECOMMENDATION -- DON'T KNOW WHO WE DO HAVE A WE DO HAVE A MOTION BY FROM MISTER SANTIAGO A SECOND FROM MISTER FLORA -- WHICH LIKE CLOTHES ARE.

WHERE TO GO MUCH CHAIRMAN? JESSE MARVIN UNRRA. LET'S ADMIT HAPPEN THIS BILL THEM. SO THIS IS THE THIS IS THE COMMITTEE PER MEDICINE ACT OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN AND THEN WE'LL TALK ABOUT AMENDMENTS TO THE MINUTE BUT BASICALLY IN A NUTSHELL MEMBERS. WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE IS THAT IN TWO THOUSAND AND TEN RAND CORPORATION DID A STUDY? THEY INDICATED HE FORTUNE 27% OF ALL -- E. D. VISITS WHERE NON URGENT CARE TO TAKE PLACE IN DIFFERENT SETTINGS SUBSEQUENT. S. COMPRISE FOUR POINT 528% OF ALL THE P. PATIENTS YET. 21228% OF ALL VISITS WEREN'T NECESSARY. IN OTHER WORDS WHAT WE'RE DOING THANK YOU SIR. WHAT WE'RE DOING IS WE'VE GOT THIS CHALLENGE WILL WHICH WE'VE GOT THIS EXTRA MENDER SIXPENCE? IN HEALTH CARE DELIVERY AND HOW DO WE APPROPRIATELY WITH THE APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF AND HERE HERE I CAN'T. SIT IT'S NO SAID -- THE THEY SAW HIM GO EACH OTHER FOR A LONG TIME SO IT TOOK ME A SECOND. BUT IN ANY OF AT HOW DO WE PROVIDE THAT LEVEL OF SERVICE AND SO WHAT WE'VE DONE HERE WITH RESPECT TO THIS ACTING OR CUT TO THE CHASE HERE. IS TO COME UP WITH THIS COMMITTEE PER MEDICINE THERE'S BEEN SOME PILOT PROJECTS THERE'S DIFFERENCE OF OPINIONS WITH RESPECT TO IT. OUT WE'VE COMMITTED TO TAKING THE AMENDMENTS NOTED AND SUGGESTION A IN THE ANALYSIS. AND WE APPRECIATE THOSE SET FORTH IN BE BUT WE ARE BUT THERE'S CERTAIN OVERLAPPING QUALIFICATIONS OF THIS MEASURES. OVERSIGHT COMMISSION EXISTING INVEST COMMISSIONS AND WE CERTAINLY COMMIT TO WORK WITH THE M. DOCTORS. OUR NURSES AND OTHERS AND WE'D HAVE BEEN TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHERE WE CAN FIND SOME SOME COMMON GROUND IN THIS REGARD AND SO. OF TURNOVER URGE CHRISTY BALMA BUT BUT WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS TO BE SMART ABOUT THIS ISSUE AND THERE ARE. LEGITIMATE MITCHELL HERE FROM THE OPPOSITION ISSUES WITH RESPECT TO SCOPE OF PRACTICE WITH RESPECT TO THE LEVEL OF PATIENT CARE THAT WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME TRYING TO FIGURE OUT AND WE'RE NOT DONE YET [inaudible] BUT THAT [inaudible] DUO. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS THE COMMITTEE CHRISTY MOMMY HAVE THE CALIFORNIA FICTIONAL FIREFIGHTERS THE THINK THE COMMITTEE AND STAFF FOR THE THIRD ANALYSIS IN THE RECOMMENDATIONS. OF THAT WE WILL ENDEAVOR TO ACCOMPLISH IN OUR NEXT STOP THIS BILL SIMPLY LEVERAGES THE TRUSTED COMMUNITY RESOURCE. CONNECTING UP PATIENTS TO THE RIGHT SERVICES AT THE RIGHT TIME AND THE OTHER FIREFIGHTERS AND PARAMEDICS IN YOUR COMMUNITIES. A THIS BILL BECAUSE THIS ISSUE HAS COME TO THIS COMMITTEE MULTIPLE TIMES SO I WOULD SAY THAT THIS BILL SPECIFICALLY IS DESIGNED TO BE VERY PATIENT FORWARD. TAPPING THE EXPERTISE. FEEDBACK AND DIRECTION OF MENTAL HEALTH. BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND MEDICAL EXPERTS -- THE THE STUDIES THE PILOTS THAT HAVE GONE ON HAVE BEEN. EVALUATED BY AN INDEPENDENT THIRD PARTY THESE YOU CASF STUDIES MULTIPLE STUDIES RELEASED IDENTIFYING THIS IS AN EFFECTIVE PROGRAM WITH. ZERO NEGATIVE OR ADVERSE PATIENT OUTCOMES. OF THIS BILL CONTAINS ROBUST REPORTING REQUIREMENTS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CONTINUE TO MONITOR EVALUATE THESE PROGRAMS AND ALSO A SUNSET SO THAT WE HAVE A CHANCE TO DEMONSTRATE EFFECTIVENESS -- OVER THE COURSE OF ITS LIFETIME I THINK THIS IS ONE SOLUTION ON MANY AND I'VE EVEN HEARD ABOUT AND COMMITTEE TODAY -- AND ON BEHALF OF MY FIREFIGHTERS WHO FEEL LIKE THEY'RE IN CRISIS MODE IN THE FIELD WITH THESE PATIENTS THAT NEED SERVICES THEY ARE NOT GETTING. WE WILL STICK TO OUR GOALS OF MAKING SURE THERE'S MORE SAFE AND MORE COMFORTED. AFTER WE'VE ARRIVED ON SCENE BUT REALLY WE WE COULD GET THEM TO THE SERVICES THEY NEED THIS BILL MAKES THAT A POSSIBLE WE URGE YOUR SUPPORT TODAY. AS CHAIR MEMBERS TIM AND REPRESENT THE CALIFORNIA CHAPTER OF THE AMERICAN BECAUSE EMERGENCY PHYSICIANS AND WE ARE SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. ON IT'S KIND OF A BIG MOMENT FOR ORGANIZATION BECAUSE WE HAVE BEEN OPPOSED TO THE IDEA OF COMMUTE PARA MEDICINE GOING BACK TO THE INTRODUCTION OF THE PILOT PROGRAMS. WE HAD EXPRESSED IN NUMBER CONCERNS AROUND THE SAFETY OF THE PROGRAMS ON THEIR WHETHER PATIENTS WILL BE TREATED EQUALLY AND THIS TYPE OF A SYSTEM. IN WORKING WITH THE SPONSOR AND THE AUTHOR WE HAVE -- COME UP WITH SOME LANGUAGE IN ASKING NINE FORTY FORCE YOU SEE TODAY WHICH GETS TO A SUPPORT POSITION WE THINK ARE PROPER PATIENT PROTECTIONS IN THERE. ON THE DATA COLLECTION IS GOOD AND ALONG WITH THE SUNSET THAT IS TO MENTION LOUD SINCE THE CHANCE TO CHECK IT. IN THERE ARE SPLIT THEIR SPECIFIC LANGUAGE ON THE RELEASED FROM TALA WHICH ENSURES THAT ALL PATIENTS ARE TREATED EQUALLY AND FOR THESE REASONS RENTS AFFORDABLE RESPECT LAST DRIVER. YOU VERY MUCH -- OTHERS IN SUPPORT JUST YOUR NAME AND ORGANIZATION. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN VERSE THE REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS FOR THE COUNTY OF SANTA CLARA ASKED ME TO CONVEY THAT COUNTY SPUR THANK YOU THANK YOU. CHAIR MEMBERS KEPT US FOR THE LOCAL HEALTH PLANS CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT. MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS DAVID JONES ABOUT THE CITY MYRIAD ON SPORT [inaudible] VERY MUCH ANYONE ELSE. SEEING NO ONE WE HAVE OPPOSITION THE CHAIR. THE TWO WITNESSES THREE MINUTES. MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE STEPHANIE ROBERSON ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA NURSES ASSOCIATION IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL -- MEMBERS WE BELIEVE THAT THIS BILL IS BASED ON WHAT PILOTS WE BELIEVE THAT FLOOD PILOTS WILL LEAD TO FLAWED POLICY AND WILL PUT PATIENTS IN HARM'S WAY. AND WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT THE JURY IS OUT ON THESE PILOTS. THEY HAVE BEEN EXTENDED FOUR TIMES AND THE DATA HAS NOT CHANGED. DELIVERING SERVICES IN THE AREA OF POST DISCHARGE FOLLOW UP WHICH IS MOST PROBLEMATIC TO US. IN THE BIGGEST COHORT OF PATIENTS 25% OF THEM -- NINE HUNDRED TWENTY TWO PATIENTS PILOTS RETURNED TO THE E. D. IN THIRTY DAYS. IN YEAR 231% OF A FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY TWO POST DISCHARGE FROM RELEASE A TWO HUNDRED FORTY NINE PATIENTS RETURN TO THE EATING IN THIRTY DAYS. AND AT THE POINT THIS POINT THE PILOTS ARE TO DECREASE ADMISSIONS THAT'S THE POINT OF THE POST DISCHARGE PILOT. THESE PILOTS OCCURRED IN LA AND YOU COUNTIES IS IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT AN ADDITIONAL TWO THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE PEOPLE THAT WERE ELIGIBLE FOR THE POST DISCHARGE PROUD OF PROJECT. DID NOT ENROLL EIGHT HUNDRED AND TWENTY THREE PATIENTS DID NOT CONSENT. PEOPLE WHO WERE ELIGIBLE BUT NOT ROLL OVER HISPANIC AFRICAN AMERICAN IN PREFERRED TO RECEIVE THE ANYWHERE INFORMATION IN A LANGUAGE OTHER THAN ENGLISH. THE MAJORITY WHERE I'M MEDI CAL BENEFICIARIES IN OVERALL THIS PILOT SERVE MOSTLY WHITE ENGLISH SPEAKING MALES. INDIA TRIAGE INFREQUENT EMS USER CASE IN ALAMEDA AND SAN DIEGO. A SMALL COHORT WITH LESS THAN EIGHTY PATIENTS OVER FORTY FIVE PATIENTS WERE ABANDONED AND FOLLOWED UP BY ACTUAL LICENSE PERSONNEL DOCTORS. WHEN THE PARAMEDICS AND TRAINEES WERE REMOVED FROM THE PILOT -- THEY WERE REMOVED FROM THE PILOT TO MEET THEIR NINE ONE ONE NEEDS FROM THE AMBULANCE PROVIDER. ONE MORE INSTANCE ALTERNATE DESTINATION MENTAL HEALTH I WANT TO NOTE THAT 99% OF THOSE PATIENTS WERE DIVERTED TO THE PILOT BECAUSE THEY WERE MEDI CAL RECIPIENTS. 1% OF THOSE PATIENTS STATE IN THE E. D. BECAUSE OF PATIENTS WERE PRIVATE PAY. I'M GONNA MOVE TO SOME SOLUTIONS AND I'M SENDING AROUND TO ALL OF YOU AND I HAVE MANY MORE -- PATIENT -- STATS THAT I CAN SHARE WITH YOU BUT THIS DOESN'T PAINT A PRETTY PICTURE NINE FOUR FOUR IS BASED ON FACT FAILED OUTCOMES CROSS ALL CONCEPTS FORTY PRE 3% OR MEDI CAL BENEFICIARIES. 20% MEDI CAL 50% AN INCH THE GOAL IS TO ALLEVIATE YOUR PRESSURE. WITH PATIENTS WHO DO NOT NEED TO BE IN THE E. R. DECREASE WALL TIME AND MAKE SURE THAT PATIENTS ARE SAFELY TRIAGE I PASSED AROUND TO YOU SOMETHING THAT'S ALREADY HAPPENING. IN OUR CALIFORNIA SYSTEMS YOU CAN HAVE A RAPID A VALUE ADD VALUATION THAT COULD HAPPEN SORT OF RAPID EMR. AND WHAT HAPPENS IS A DOCTOR -- COMBINED WITH NURSES NURSE PRACTITIONERS MPS RIGHT NOW IN OUR SYSTEM OUR TRIAGE ING THOSE LOW ACUITY PATIENTS SO WHEN A PARAMEDIC CALLS INTO THE OUR LIKE THEY DO RIGHT NOW THEY SAY THEY HAVE A PATIENT. THEY HAVE THESE RAPID EVALUATION UNITS WHERE THESE. COM COLD BLUE TEAMS COME TO THE SITE COME TO WHERE THE PATIENT IS AND DISCHARGES THEM OR THEY CAN GO TO THE LOCAL PARAMEDIC AND SAY YOU CAN TAKE THEM TO AN ALTERNATE DESTINATION CENTER. AND BASED ON SOME OF THOSE PILOTS THE OF DECREASE WALL TIME AND DECREASED -- TIME IN THE E. R. FOR EACH PATIENT SO WE URGE THAT YOU LOOK AT THESE OTHER ALTERNATIVES MEMBERS THINK YOU. PETER CALLISON ON BEHALF OF TO CLIENTS ONE WOULD BE THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION FOR HEALTH SERVICES AT HOME WHICH A HOME HEALTH AGENCIES THEIR OPPOSITION IS SIMILAR TO WHAT WAS ARTICULATED BY THE NURSES ASSOCIATION. SECOND CLIENT HAS THE CALIFORNIA HOSPICE AND PALLIATIVE CARE ASSOCIATION I'D LIKE TO FOCUS MY COMMENTS UPON THE IMPACT ON HOSPICE. WITH THIS -- WITH THIS LEGISLATION IT'S OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT UNDER THE PILOT PROGRAMS THAT THE ONLY HOSPICE PARTICIPANT WAS IN VENTURA COUNTY. A GOOGLE SEARCH REVEALED THAT THERE'S ABOUT ELEVEN HIGHER HOSPICE PROGRAMS IN VENTURA COUNTY IT'S OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT ONE HOSPICE PROGRAM PARTICIPATED IN THAT PILOT THAT WOULD MEAN THAT. TEN OF THE HOSPICES DECLINED TO PARTICIPATE BECAUSE THEY DID NOT FIND THAT TO BE USEFUL FOR THEIR PATIENTS OR FOR THEIR PROGRAMS. HAVING SAID THAT. THE DILEMMA WITH HOSPICE IS THAT THE IT'S FOR THE TERMINALLY ILL. IT'S NOT -- THAT PAYMENT SYSTEM FOR HOSPICES CAPITATED IT'S LIKE A MANAGED CARE SYSTEM FOR THE TERMINALLY ILL. BECAUSE OF THAT IF A NON LICENSE A NON HOSPICE LICENSE PERSONNEL AS INSINUATED INTO THE CARE OR PER FILE PERFECT PROVIDES CARE OF SOME WAY SHAPE OR FORM. THAN THAT IMPACTS HOW THE HOSPICE IS REIMBURSED IT IMPACTS HOW WHO PAYS FOR SHOULD A PATIENT BE. TRANSFERRED TO AN EMERGENCY ROOM IS THE HOSPICE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE PAYMENT OF FOR THE REIMBURSEMENT IS THE FAMILY IS THE FAMILY IS THE PATIENT IT'S UNCERTAIN. SO THAT WE BELIEVE THAT THE TERMINALLY ILL SECTION OF THE BILL SHOULD BE COMMENDED TO EXCLUDE HOSPICE PARTICIPATION -- HAPPY TO TALK WITH THAT FURTHER WITH THE SPONSORED OR WHAT THE AUTHOR WE JUST DON'T THINK THAT IT'S COMPATIBLE FOR HOW HOSPICES STRUCTURED FOR THE PURPOSE AUSPICES SERVED -- AND RESPECTFULLY REQUEST THAT FROM FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION. OTHERS IN OPPOSITION JUST YOUR NAME AND ORGANIZATION. I MISTER CHAIR CHRIS MCKAY LEON WE HAVE THE CALIFORNIA AMBULANCE ASSOCIATION WE ARE OPPOSE FOR OTHER REASONS. THAT'S YOU ARMSTRONG ON BEHALF OF THE MS ADMINISTRATORS ASSOCIATION AN EMERGENCY MEDICAL DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION REGRETFULLY A POST [inaudible] YOU. THE DEPARTMENT THE CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION AND OPPOSITION OF THE BILL ANYONE ELSE. SEE KNOWN BRING BACK TO COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS COMMENTS QUESTIONS FROM ME. I'M SORRY MR. YEAH MISTER BIG JUST TO TALK ABOUT THE OF THE AMENDMENTS -- THAT SPECIFIC SPECIFICALLY BE SEE YOUR GONNA TAKE THE A A BUT NOT. BE CORRECTED AND THEN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS HERE IT'S IS GIVEN THE OVERLAP THE TWO ENTITIES THE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEES HOUSE WAS BUILT PEERS UNNECESSARY. AND DUPLICATIVE. DO YOU NOT BELIEVE THAT TO BE TRUE. WELL I THINK WE NEED TO CONSULT WITH ALL THE VARIOUS FOLKS TO FIND OUT I MEAN WE IS THIS PROCESS WHO DO READ THE BILL IT'S KIND OF AMAZING TO ME. IT BASICALLY SETS FORTH LOCAL ABOUT OUR AUTONOMY TO MAKE A DETERMINATION AND SETS FORTH WITH THAT FRAME LOOKS LIKE. THEY GOT REQUIRES A BIT MORE HOMEWORK TALK AND EVERYBODY TO FIGURE OUT THOSE COMMITTEES LOOK LIKE OR HAVE. THEY SUGGESTED THAT WE'RE HAPPY TO TAKE THE TIME TO DO THE PUT A HUGE AMOUNT TIMES MEASURE SO FAR AND COMMITTED TO KEEP WORKING ON IT UNFORTUNATELY THAT'S ONE OF THE CHALLENGES WITH THIS LEGISLATIVE PROCESS HAS BEEN. PERFORMED ABOUT THIRTY FIVE YEARS AGO TED. HAS THESE VEHICLES RUN THROUGH COMMITTEES RATHER THAN AMENDING IMAGE GO ALONG SO WHAT'S. WE WILL WILL WORK WILL CONTINUE WORK ON YOU THAT COMMITMENTS ARE I JERRY JUST WANTED. TO HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH MY FIRE CHIEF IN MY COUNTY TODAY I'M WHOSE. PORTER OF OF THIS -- AND I'M GONNA SUPPORT THIS TODAY ALTHOUGH I DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS ON A NUMBER OF OF DIFFERENT THINGS HELP TO BUILD A CONTINUE WORKING ON IT BUT I AM I WILL -- I WILL REGRET IT WILL SUPPORT IT AND I DO THINK THIS SORT OF INNOVATIVE APPROACH AS WE CONTINUE ON IS GOING TO BE VERY HELPFUL -- ABOUT FOR THE FIRE SERVICE AND FOR PREPARE MEDICINE MATURE NAM GOING FOR IT IT'S HARD LOOK THE THESE THINGS ARE CHALLENGING BUT WE'VE GOT UNBELIEVABLE COST PRESSURE. ON YOU KNOW WITH THAT THAT THAT SOMEBODY BECAUSE NINE ONE ONE IN A FIRE. DE OFFICIAL WHO DID SHOWS UP COMES DIFFERENT COUNTIES A DIFFERENT KIND OF EQUIPMENT. AND SOMETIMES A PERSON IS CALLED THIRTY FIVE BUT CERTAINLY YOU NEED THE PROFESSIONS OF DOCTORS AND NURSES AND MAKING SOME OF THESE DETERMINATIONS. BUT IT TOOK THESE ARE TOUGH DECISIONS AND SO. YOU KNOW WE MAKE GOVERNMENT WORK BETTER IS TO DO THE HOMEWORK TO FIGURE IT OUT THAT'S WILLING TO DO. MISTER CHARLES SECOND MOTION. BIGELOW THANK YOU VERY MUCH BEE BEE -- I'M GLAD TO HEAR THAT YOU'RE A ENTERTAINING THE AMENDMENT ON A I APPRECIATE THAT AND I ALSO. WAS WONDERING IF YOU COULD MAYBE ADDRESS SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT WERE RAISED ABOUT THE PRIVATE COMMENTS THAT WERE MADE HERE A MOMENT AGO. AND I HAVE ANOTHER QUESTION OF WELL THE BIG ISSUE IS A BIG ISSUE IF FACING. A WITH RESPECT TO ON THIS ISSUE IS THE IDEA THAT PUBLIC AGENCY PREFER PREFERENCE IN OUR JUDGMENT REALLY PRESERVES THE RIGHT OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO MANAGE -- EMERGENCY RESPONSE SYSTEMS INTEGRATE THOSE A CRITICAL SERVICES GENDER EXISTING PLANTS RIGHT IF YOU LOOK AT THE FRAMEWORK OF THIS. I THINK IN THE LARGER ARCHITECTURE DE AND WILL LOOK TO YOU WORK ON IT IT'S ALL ABOUT TRYING TO SET A FRAMEWORK FOR LOCAL OPTIONS RIGHT IF YOU READ THIS IF A LOCAL AGENCY WITH THE COUNTY ELECTS TO DEVELOP. HERE'S HOW TO DO THIS AND GOES THROUGH AND SETS FORTH THAT PLANTS SO I THINK THERE IS PARTICULARLY FLEXIBILITY CERTAIN AND CERTAINLY. THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE THE FIRST RESPONDER IF YOU WILL IN THOSE COUNTIES WHERE THEY DON'T HAVE A I THINK GOVERNMENT WILL HAVE THE ABILITY TO TO DO WITHOUT A CAR APPROPRIATELY AND BEING SOMEONE WHO IS ON THE FRONTLINE WHO DOES RESPOND ON A REGULAR BASIS AS AN EMT -- I COULD SEE THE SAME PATIENT OVER AND OVER. OVER AND OVER RIGHT IT'S GROUNDHOG DAY IN MANY CASES -- IN THAT THIS THE SCENARIO NEVER CHANGES. I CAN'T CITE ONE WHERE DID CHANGE. REALLY YEAH THE THIRD TIME THERE YOU ASSUMED YOU WERE NOT GOING TO STAGE OUTSIDE. I WALKED IN AND IT'S ILLEGALLY SHOT FIVE TIMES. THAT WAS A TIME TO TAKE YOUR SIGN AND LEAVE. IT SO ANY DID HE DID DESTRUCTIVE WEAPON -- DON'T THE REALITY THE REAL ISSUE IS. FIREMAN GET THEIR FIRST. IN THE RURAL AREA RIGHT BUT THE TRUTH IS. WE DON'T HAVE PARAMEDICS IN A FIRE SYSTEM IN RURAL AREAS FOR THE VAST MAJORITY NOT IN ALL AREAS BUT IF FOR THE VAST MAJORITY AT LEAST THE DISTRICT THAT I CAN SAY. I REPRESENT. IN MOST CASES IS THE LOCALEMS AMBULANCE CARRIERS. THERE THE FIRST PEOPLE THERE IN MANY CASES THEY'RE NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS [inaudible] SO HOPEFULLY WE WON'T BE STE TRADING [inaudible] AND HARMING THOSE FOLKS WHO ARE IN PRIVATE ENTERPRISE WILL BE DOING OF VALUE JOB. IN OUR COMMUNITIES AS WE MOVE FORWARD ON BUT AT THE SAME TIME WORKING IN RESPECTING -- WHAT WHAT THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS CAN AND CAN'T DO AND I THINK THIS MEMO COVERS A GREAT DEAL OF THAT? PERSPECTIVE OF THEIR LIKE IT I ENJOY TO SEE IF I COULD COULD IF I COULD JUST ADD TO YOUR THOUGHT. WITH THE WHOLE THING SURE IT IN SECTION SEVENTY NINE ONE SEVEN NINE SEVEN POINT TO THE SEVEN SEVEN TWO IT SAYS. THAT THE REPORTER SUPERVISOR ESTABLISH EMERGENCY MEDICAL CARE COMMITTEE AND SO ALSO INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING MEMBERS. THAT ADVISE EMS AGENCY ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF COMMITTEE PARAMEDICS PROGRAMS SO THAT THE WHOLE IDEA. I THINK IN THE STATE IS BIGGEST CALIFORNIA'S LONGER STILL OF ONE CALIFORNIANS SET OF THREE OR SIX WHATEVER. THE NUMBERS THAT HAVE BEEN PROPOSED OVER THE YEARS. THE IDEA IS TO MARRY THE PROFESSIONALISM BY REQUIRING TWO REGISTERED NURSES RECORDING TO E. R.. DOCKS REQUIRING A NUMBER OF OTHER FOLKS IN THE PROCESS THAT THAT THE STANDARDS BE SAD. THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS TO MAKE THOSE DETERMINATIONS WITH THE ADVICE. BECAUSE NOT EVERY CA I SUSPECT YOU KNOW ALPINE COUNTY AND THAT WE CITIES -- OR TRINITY COUNTY WEAVERVILLE IT WILL HAVE DIFFERENT STANDARDS IN LOS ANGELES OR SAN DIEGO AND THEY'LL MAKE THOSE DETERMINATIONS WITH THE ADVICE OF EXPERTS [inaudible] ACTUALLY IT. AS FAR AS THE MPS GO. IT'S ONE STANDARD NATIONWIDE. AND WERE ON A NATIONALIST AND AND WE DO HAVE STATED CALIFORNIA STANDARD ARE THAT WE ACT ON AND THEN EACH BOARD OF SUPERVISORS ADOPTS THE IN MANY CASES THOSE FORTY SUPERVISORS. TURN IT OVER TO A JOINT. OPERATION LIKE THE FRESNO MADERA MARIN MERCED AGENCY WHICH IS BASED ON A FRESNO. WE WORK UNDER THOSE STANDARDS AND THE SCOPE OF PRACTICE THAT'S PLACED HIM IN IN. IN ACTION AND THAT HAPPENS THROUGHOUT THIS MY DISTRICT. LIKE COUNTIES COMBINED AND WORK TOGETHER IN A MULTI AGENCY ARE A WORLD SO IT BECOMES A LITTLE MORE COMPLICATED IN THE CONTEXT OF WHAT EVERYONE'S DOING. ROSETTA POLLEN TWIRL A TO RURAL FROM THAT URBANIZED THOUGHT PROCESS THAT MAYBE YOU'RE ACCLIMATED TO FOUR I'M MORE RULE. ACCLIMATED. TO GIVEN THAT SAID I THINK I'M IN A PLACE WHERE I UNDERSTAND WHERE YOU'RE GOING. AND THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE CAN SUPPORT OUR TODAY BUT I DO HAVE ONE FINAL CONCERT. YOU TALKED ABOUT THE AGED -- COMMUNITY AND HOW WE CAN HANDLE THAT. BECAUSE IT IS IT'S DIFFERENT SCOPE IN A DIFFERENT MECHANISM FOR HANDLING OF PATIENTS. MAYBE THAT CONVERSATION CAN CONTINUE. ULCER -- GREAT DEAL. BECAUSE AS WE GO THAT'S JUST A SEPARATE ENTITY THAT MOVES THE PATIENT NOT ALWAYS IS THAT. CALLED AN ADVANCED LIFE CALL. ALRIGHT APPRECIATE IT THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE [inaudible] BERMAN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- DESPICABLE QUESTIONS SO -- I WOULD START WITH -- THE EMERGENCY ROOM PHYSICIANS REPRESENTATIVE VALUE YOU OUTLINED THAT PREVIOUS SEE. THERE WAS OPPOSITION AND I DO REMEMBER HEARING ON A SIMILAR BILL. HEARING A CONCERN ABOUT WHO SHOULD ASSESS SOMEONE'S -- MEDICAL CONDITION AND I GUESS I WOULD ASK THAT QUESTION TO YOU IN. AND I GUESS ON BEHALF OF YOUR MEMBERS AND NURSES -- YOU KNOW BOMB Y. THE CHANGE -- I GUESS IN YOUR POSITION WHAT'S DIFFERENT -- GIVEN THE CONCERN EXPRESSED BEFORE ARM INTO AND WHY SHOULD THIS. WHY SHOULD WE BE CONCERNED IF -- THE ASSESSMENTS ARE HAPPENING -- BY A PHYSICIAN AND A NURSE IN IN AN EMERGENCY ROOM SET. I THINK YOUR SERMON. ON BEHALF EMERGENCY PHYSICIANS WE FEEL THAT AND ASKING NINE FORTY FOUR THERE SOME GUARDRAILS THEY'VE BEEN PUT IN PLACE TO ENSURE THAT WHEN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE PROTOCOLS THAT WILL BE USED BY THE PARAMEDICS IN THE FIELD. THEY'LL HAVE SOME ADDITIONAL OVERSIGHTS YOU BOTH AT THE LOCAL LEVEL AND AT THE STATE LEVEL AND GETTING TO A KIND OF SENATE AROUND THE AMENDMENT THAT WAS DESCRIBED IN AND AND BE IN THE ANALYSIS. ONE OF THE VALUES THAT WE SEE IN THAT COMMITTEE IS THAT IT WOULD BE COMPRISED OF PEOPLE WHO ARE MORE FAMILIAR WITH DEVELOPING PRODUCT BECAUSE FOR IT ADDRESSING PATIENTS OF THAT. KIND SO SOMEONE WHO IS A LOWER CUTIE PATIENT TODAY M. SAYS MORE GEARED TOWARDS TRUMPCARE. IT'S MORE GEARED TOWARDS SETTING UP SYSTEMS FOR ESTABLISHING CRITERIA FOR A STROKES AND OR STOP ME CENTERS ALSO A VERY DIFFERENT TYPE OF THE PATIENT. ARE CONCERNED WITH THE CURRENT STRUCTURE OF THEM SAYS THAT IT MAY NOT BE COMPRISED OF ENOUGH EXPERTS. TO BEST EVALUATE WHETHER THE PROTOCOLS BEING DEVELOPED ARE APPROPRIATE FOR A DIFFERENT TYPE OF THE PATIENT. SO US WITH SENATOR HERTZBERG TALKING ABOUT TRYING -- TO TO THROUGHOUT WHAT THE COMPOSITION OF THAT IS SO WE FELT THAT WAS ANOTHER IMPORTANT PART OF S. B. NINE FORTY FOUR THAT WE HAD NOT SEEN ANOTHER LEGISLATION. FOUND WE ALSO FELT IT WAS IMPORTANT TO HAVE WHATEVER WE PUT INTO LAW IS LARGELY BASED ON THE PILOTS THAT HAVE BEEN TESTED SO OUR PERSPECTIVE IS DIFFERENT TEST SOMETHING. WE FEEL THAT IT HAS SHOWN THAT THAT THIS CAN BE DONE THAT WE SHOULD MODEL LEGISLATION AROUND THAT. IN THE ONE THE MOST IMPORTANT ONES IS THAT WE INCLUDE LANGUAGE TO ENSURE THAT ALL PATIENTS ARE TREATED EQUALLY. SO WE WORRY THAT IF YOU SET UP A SYSTEM WHERE POTENTIALLY ONLY CERTAIN PATIENTS GO TO A SOBERING CENTER SO MAYBE YOU'RE HOMELESS PATIENTS -- ARE MORE LIKELY TO END UP IN THAT SITUATION WHERE IT'S A BETTER PAYING PAY SHOULD BE MORE LIKELY THAN UP AT THE HOSPITAL. AYE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT. THE SPIRIT OF PROVIDING EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES THAT WE TREAT EVERYONE THE SAME THAT'S EQUAL ACCESS SO THOSE THINGS WERE INCLUDED WHICH GOT OUR ORGANIZATION TO MORE. COMFORTABLE LEVEL CLASSES QUESTION -- TO THAT PROPONENTS AND OPPONENTS YOU KNOW IS THIS IS ABOUT SCOPE OF PRACTICE MEANING WE HAVE TWO GROUPS SAID -- FROM MY EXPERIENCE SERVICE WELL YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN SERVED WELL BY PARAMEDICS HAD BEEN SERVED WELL BY NURSES -- EXISTE CASE GORGEOUS SWAPPING ONE GROUP FOR ANOTHER -- IS A CISCO POSITION CISCO CONVERSATION. STEPHANIE WITH THE STEPHANIE ROBERSON WITH CALIFORNIA NURSES ASSOCIATION WE FULLY BELIEVE THAT THIS IS A SCOPE ISSUE WE FELT THAT THIS ISSUE SHOULD WANT TO BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS COMMITTEE. WE BELIEVE AND AT AN APPROPRIATELY TRAINED GREAT PRE HOSPITAL CARE PARAMEDIC THOUGHTS THE LANE THAT PARAMEDICS ARE IN AND THEY DO THE HAND OFF -- TO  <u><c.green>OUR PHYSICIANS NURSES</c></u> AND AND OTHER LICENSE PERSONAL YOU KNOW I WANT TO GO BACK A LITTLE BIT TO THE TWO TIERED ISSUE WE HAVEN'T SEEN THE LANGUAGE BUT WE HAVE BEEN RAILING ON THAT ISSUE SINCE THE INCEPTION OF THIS BILL. WHAT YOU HAVE -- IN IN IN BETTER THAN THIS BILL. ARE -- AMBITION BASICALLY CONSORTIUMS WITH HOSPITALS IN THE SO BRING IN BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CENTERS THAT ONLY TAKE MEDI CAL. RECIPIENTS. THAT BY DEFINITION IS EMBEDDED IN THIS BILL THAT HAS NOT BEEN FIXED WE DID NOT GET ANY AMENDMENTS ON THAT ISSUE SO IF YOU CARE ABOUT IF YOU CARE ABOUT THE TWO TIRED STANDARD CARE. HE WOULD WANT TO LOOK AT OUR AMENDMENTS I BELIEVE ON PAGE FIVE OR SIX OF OUR OPPOSE LETTER I'M SORRY AND PASS IT OUT. SO ABSOLUTELY WE DON'T FEEL THAT THESE ARE GOOD MODELS IF I HAD MORE TIME I WOULD LAY OUT ALL OF THAT YOU KNOW ADVERSE EVENTS THAT HAVE HAPPENED. WITH THE PILOTS THERE'S DATA THAT WE ACTUALLY CAN'T COMPARE THAT. UCSF IS HIDING FROM US THAT INSA IS HIDING FROM US WE ARE ASKING FOR THE RAW DATA TO COMPARE THOSE NUMBERS THEY'RE NOT GIVING IT TO US SO WHAT ARE THEY HIDING. SO NOT ONLY DO WE LEAVE THAT THIS IS A SCHOOL FOR PROPOSITION THAT PATIENTS HAVE BEEN DIVERTED TO THE SOBERING CENTERS AND THEN GO BACK TO THE E. R. BECAUSE THE PARAMEDICS THAT ARE OUT IN THE FIELD ARE ASSESSING THESE PATIENTS -- ADEQUATELY. WHEN YOU LOOK AT A A PATIENT WHO IS IS YOU KNOW ON HOW THE SOBERING ISSUE WHOSE INEBRIATED OFTENTIMES YOU KNOW THAT DOESN'T ALWAYS PRESENT AS SUCH? THESE PATIENTS MAY HAVE FALLEN WE'VE SEEN THOSE ISSUES AND THERE ARE LAYERED ISSUES AND IN. EMSA IN YOU SEE A STEPS ONLY DATA. TROUBLE IN THE FIELD. UNDERSTANDING IF IT'S DRUGS OPIATES AND ALCOHOL THOSE ARE LAYERED ISSUES AND THOSE ARE VERY COMPLEX SITUATIONS SO THAT WAS ALSO CAPTURED IN THE DATA THAT THE PROPONENTS ARE TALKING ABOUT TODAY. SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT ANSWER ON BEHALF OF HOSPICE IN THAT THE ISSUE FOR THE HOSPICE PROGRAMS IS. THE CONTINUITY OF CARE FOR THE PATIENT A PLAN OF CARE FOR HOSPICE PATIENTS THE AVERAGE STATE LIKE OF STATE FOR HOSPICE. SEVENTEEN DAYS SO THIS IS A PATIENT POPULATION IN THE WANING DAYS OF THEIR LIFE SO ENSURING THAT THEIR CARE IS CONDUCTED AS THEY HAVE ARRANGED WHEN DAVE'S SECURED HOSPICE CARE -- TO ENSURE THAT IF THERE ARE -- ADVANCE DIRECTIVES THAT THERE HONORED BUT THERE'S ALSO THE ECONOMIC ELEMENT OF IN INCLUDING INTO HOW THAT PATIENT IS TREATED AND NON LICENSED HOSPICE PERSONNEL ISSUE. THAT COULD PUT THE HOSPICE PROGRAM AT RISK FINANCIALLY OR THE PATIENT'S FAMILY AT RISK COULD YOU JUST TELL US WHAT THE BASELINE IS FOR EMERGENCY -- SUPPORT FOR SOMEONE IN A HOSPICE ENVIRONMENT JUST LIKE AND UNDERSTAND WHAT IT IS NOW IN WHAT WOULD BE UNDER THE PARA MEDICINE PROGRAM THE REASON I I AND I SHOULD KNOW THIS BUT BECAUSE I WAS ALSO SOCIAL WORKER. AND I PROVIDED HOSPICE SOCIAL WORK SERVICES IN. IN HOMES. FOR PATIENTS BUT I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT THE ROLE IS FOR THAT IMPAIR MEDICINE -- IN THE HOSPICE SO WHAT WE TALK ABOUT WHAT'S THE CONCERN THAT MIGHT HAPPEN. WELL I GOT A CONCERN -- ONE CONCERN IS FOR EXAMPLE -- IF A PATIENT DOES NEED TO LEGITIMATELY A HOSPICE PATIENT NEED TO BE TRANSFERRED TO AN EMERGENCY ROOM. WHICH GIVEN THAT HOSPICE CARE IS CARE THAT IS PROVIDED FOR THOSE WHO HAVE -- NO LONGER ARE SEEKING CURED OF CARE AND THAT OFTEN. BUT WHEN IT DOES IF A THE WAY IT WORKS CURRENTLY IS IF A HOSPICE PERSONNEL IS THE ONE WHO MAKES THE CALL TO HAVE. EMERGENCY MEDICAL TRANSPORT THEN THAT IS DEALT WITH THROUGH THE HOSPICES CAPITATED PAYMENT. AND THE HOSPICE Y. -- WINDS UP IT BECOMES PART OF THEIR REIMBURSEMENT BUT IF A NON HOSPICE PERSONNEL MAKES THAT CALL. AND THE PATIENT IS TRANSFERRED THEN EITHER THE HOSPICE PROGRAM HAVE TO EAT THE COST OF THAT. THEMSELVES. OR THE PATIENT'S FAMILY MAYBE WIND UP HAVING TO BEAR THE BURDEN OF IT INTERFERE IT JUST INTERFERES WITH THE FLOW OF CARE FOR THE FOR THE PATIENT'S FAMILY THE PATIENT. AND ULTIMATELY FOR THE THE ECONOMICS OF THE HOSPICE PROGRAM ITSELF. I THINK THE AUTHOR WANTED TO ADDRESS THE SCOPE QUESTION. BUT AS I HAVE AN ANSWER O. WAY ORDER OR YOU WITNESSES YOU KNOW I BASICALLY WHAT LOOK WEEKLY WE DRESS THIS. AND I'LL SHOW TWO SECTIONS IF YOU LOOK AT PAGE TWELVE OF THE MEASURE. A SUB PARAGRAPH TWO IT SAYS. MY TALKS ABOUT THE PROTOCOL IT'S IS THE FACILITY NOT BE BASED UPON ARE AFFECTED BY THE PATIENTS AT THIS CITY CITIZENSHIP AGE PRE EXISTING MEDICAL ADDITIONS INSURANCE STATUS. ECONOMIC STATUS ABILITY TO PAY MEDICAL SERVICES OR ANY OTHER CHARACTERISTIC LISTS IS DEFINED SECTION FIFTY ONE US OF A CALL THAT'S GENERAL CIVIL RIGHTS ACT PASSED. NINETY FOUR I REMEMBER THAT. AND IN ADDITION THE IF YOU LOOK AT PAGE THIRTEEN REGIONAL LANGUAGE WAS ANY AGREEMENT WITH AN ALTERNATE DESTINATION FACILITY. HAS TO BE A PROVIDE THAT IF IT FAILS TO PUT OPERATE RECORDS OF SIX THIRTEEN SEVENTEEN THAT'S M. TAUGHT WHICH IS THE BOTH FEDERAL AND STATE EMERGENCY MEDICAL TREATMENT LABOR I IT WILL RESULT IN THE IMMEDIATE TERMINATION OF THE USE THE FACILITIES FOR THE COMMITTEE AMERICA. PERMISSION PROFILE. SO BOTH WITH RESPECT TO THE FACILITY IN WITH RESPECT TO THE TREATMENT. BUT HE CRACKED WHEAT AND ONE THAT WE HAD THE BILL IN THE OTHER ONLY AT THE MAN. I GUESS I SAY RACED US WE THOUGHT IT WAS APPROPRIATE ON HOW TO SENSE IT THIS WAY BECAUSE YOU'RE IN SO FORTUNATE THERE TOO IMPORTANT GROUPS BEFORE US -- WHO EACH PROVIDING INCREDIBLE SERVICE TO OUR COMMUNITY SAID ABSOLUTE WHAT I WANT TO BE A TO BE A TO SAY IS ONE OF THE TONIGHT'S ON SUPPORTING WHAT'S IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BEST PUBLIC HEALTH? AND SO I GUESS I'M GONNA BOIL IT DOWN TO THE PROPONENTS WILL SAY WHY THIS IS IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH. IN THE OPPONENTS WILL SAY WHY IT'S NOT BE AND YOU KNOW I I'M NOT GOING TO GO TO SOME THAT'S A SCOPE ISSUE BUT IT'S ABOUT. PROMOTING THE PUBLIC HEALTH I'M ABOUT IT WHY IS THIS IN THE BEST OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND FOR THOSE WHO DON'T AGREE WHY WHY WHAT IMPACTS OR NEGATIVE IMPACTS. DO YOU THINK YOU CAN OCCUR. I CAN ANSWER MIGHT THE LITERATURE. HOW THROUGH THE CHAIR HE'S ONE OF THE GROUPS BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT HE WAS ARE THURMOND YOU'RE RIGHT ON THE MONEY THIS IS ABOUT THE BENEFIT TO PUBLIC HEALTH IS NOT OF THE SCOPE FIGHT AND THE LOCALLY MISS AGENCIES TALK ABOUT LOCAL OPTIONAL SCOPES OF PRACTICE THAT ARE AUTHORIZED NOW FOR EMTS. WANTS TO THE PARAMEDICS ABSENT ANY LEGISLATIVE AUTHORIZATION BECAUSE THEY'RE ALWAYS OPERATING UNDER MEDICAL CONTROL OF MEDICAL DIRECTOR IN THE COUNTIES -- BUT THIS IS A PROMOTION OF PUBLIC HEALTH BECAUSE IT WHAT WE'RE SUGGESTING IS THAT IF WE CONTINUE TO RESPOND ON THE SAME POPULATION OF FOLKS? OF ORAL HOSPITALS ARE DISCHARGING PATIENTS WHO END RIGHT BACK UP IN THE ER BECAUSE OF A FAILURE OF CONFORMANCE WITH THEIR MEDICATIONS OR WHAT HAVE YOU THE HOSPICE. IS IS SIMPLY ABOUT. MAKING SURE THAT [inaudible] WE'RE NOT TRANSPORTING THEM AGAINST THEIR WISHES THAT IS THE WHOLE POINT OF THE HOSPICE A PILOT PROJECT IN THE AUTHORIZATION OF THIS BILL SO THIS IS A PROMOTIONAL PUBLIC HEALTH. THIS IS THIS IS A SERVICE THAT DOESN'T EXIST FOR PATIENTS WHICH IS WHY THEY'RE FALLING THROUGH THE CRACKS. AND I ONE MORE THING I JUST IDENTIFY BECAUSE IN THE CONTEXT OF YOUR QUESTION. IT WAS REVISITED MAYBE -- REPEATEDLY. THESE PILOTS WERE VOLUNTARY SO YOU GOT FACILITIES THAT VOLUNTEERED TO PARTICIPATE IN TESSA'S PROGRAM YOU CAN'T JUDGE THE PROGRAM. THAT HAD ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY MEDI CAL PATIENTS BECAUSE THEIR ACCOUNT OF HIS COUNTY FACILITY AND THAT'S WHO THEY ACCEPTED IT WASN'T BECAUSE THEY WERE MAKING SOME SELECTION THE FIELD AND DIVERTED THAT PATIENT POPULATION SO THE DATA CAN TELL LOTS OF STORIES. BUT I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT. THE THE INDEPENDENT EVALUATOR HAS NO INTEREST IN THIS PROJECT EXCEPT TO SUGGEST IS THIS THE RIGHT THING FOR A COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTER COMMUNITY BENEFIT. AND THE FIREFIGHTERS BELIEVE IT IS WHICH IS WHY WE ARE BEFORE YOU. AFTERNOON EVENING NIGHT. I UNDERSTAND WHAT -- THIS MOMENT JUST SAID ABOUT YOU KNOW THESE FACILITIES ONLY ACCEPT MEDICAL PATIENTS BUT I WOULD ARGUE THAT THAT IS DONE BY DESIGN. SO YOU HAVE IN YOU CAN TREAT SYSTEM. THAT BASICALLY ONLY ACCEPTS MEDI CAL PATIENTS AND IF THAT'S NOT THE CASE IN THIS WAS OPEN TO EVERYONE WE LOOKED AT THE DATA GOT A BIT THE ARE PRIVATE PAY. EVERYBODY ELSE WOULD TO THESE FACILITIES SO IT'S DONE BY DESIGN WHETHER IT'S NOT THE CHARGER THAT'S NOT THE INTENT IS DONEBY DESIGNS WITH INHERENT IN THE PROCESS THAT'S NOT RIGHT. WE ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT THERE'S A LOOPHOLE IN SECTION THIRTEEN SEVENTEEN THAT NEEDS TO BE FIXED WE HAVEN'T SEEN THE LANGUAGE IT'S NOT A TOTAL FIX. SO THIS DOES NOT PROMOTE PUBLIC HEALTH WE BELIEVE WE BELIEVE THAT YOU HAD WHOLESALE PATIENTS DECIDING YOU KNOW BY THEIR OWN VOLITION THAT THEY'D WANT TO TAKE PART OF THESE PILOTS WHO HAD HOLE SO COMMUNITIES. PERMANENTLY FOLKS OF COLOR THAT DECLINED THESE PILOTS IT'S NOT REFER REFLECTIVE OF CALIFORNIA AND I DON'T BELIEVE THAT WE SHOULD MOVE PUBLIC POLICY IN A FASHION THAT'S NOT REFLECTIVE OF CALIFORNIA. WE ALL KNOW ABOUT SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH. WE ALL KNOW THAT IF YOU ARE AFRICAN AMERICAN YOU PRESENT WITH SICKLE CELL AND OTHER ISSUES SO FOR ABOUT PUBLIC HEALTH WE NEED TO BE MOVING POLICIES THAT BEST. YOU KNOW SUIT THE PATIENT AND WE JUST DON'T THE RIGHT WAY WE'VE AGAIN SHOWED YOU SOME MODELS THAT WORK. OUR MEMBERS ARE DOING THIS THIS THIS TRIAGE AND WE WOULD BE OUT A RATIO SO IF WE CAN PUT A NURSE ON THE TRUCK WE WOULD BUT WE CAN'T. THAT IS THAT IS SOMETHING THAT IS A NON STARTER FOR US AND THAT WOULD BE BAD FOR PATIENT SAFETY WE CAN'T HAVE AN RN JUMP ON THE TRUCK INTO THE ASSESSMENT BUT WHAT WE HAVE SAID IS. IN THE LOT OF THESE CASES IN CALIFORNIA HOSPITALS TODAY THERE ARE SYSTEMS THAT WORK THAT REDUCE WAIT TIME THAT REDUCE WALL TIME AND THEN YOU ALSO HAVE THE APPROPRIATE PRACTITIONER DOING THE ASSESSMENTS THAT TO TRIPLE WHEN. WE PASS THOSE THINGS AROUND THAT JUST BECAUSE THE PROPONENTS AND COME UP WITH IT DOESN'T MEAN IT'S NOT A GOOD THING. SO I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD MODEL AND TESTED IN SOME CASES COMBAT KAISER MARINO VALLEY SIXTY SEVEN MINUTES TO TWELVE MINUTES USING POSITION ARE IN MODEL. IN OTHER CASES FOUR TO SIXHOURS WERE REDUCED TO ONE TO TO THAT. DOOR TO PHYSICIAN AND OUT THE DOOR I THINK I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING WE OUGHT TO LOOK AT THANKS TO THE PARTICIPANTS THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. IF YOU VERY MUCH ANYONE ELSE. SEEING NO. ONE JUST TO CLOSE ALL WILL SAY IN CLOSING IS THE TERROR. BERMAN MADE A POINT ABOUT. GROUPS THAT CARE DEEPLY ABOUT THE PUBLIC HEALTH OF CALIFORNIA. THIS HAS CAUSED ATTENTION. WHICH I DON'T LIKE. THE MEETING IN MY OFFICE. THIS WEEK WAS AT LAST WEEK A CAMERA PURSUANT. AND TRYING TO GET AND LISTEN TO THE POINTS THAT WERE MADE. TRYING TO GET THE PARTIES TO FIGURE IS A PLACE. THEY'RE MUCH SMARTER ON THIS ISSUE THAT I DON'T APPEAR BEFORE HEALTH COMMITTEE OFTEN. BUT I THOUGHT THAT WAS COMMON SENSE IN THE NOTION OF TRYING TO DO EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO PROMOTE COMMUNITY PARA MEDICINE. AND AVOIDING THIS PROBLEM BECAUSE IT WILL TIME OR WHATEVER BUT JUST BASIC GOVERNMENT COST WHERE WE CAN GET STUFF DONE IN A MORE INTELLIGENT WAY. I THOUGHT THAT THAT WAS FLEXIBILITY IN THE PROPOSAL. LOCALS CONTROL IN THE PROPOSAL TO DO THAT CLEARLY THERE'S SOME CERTAIN CHALLENGES WITH RESPECT TO INTERPRETATION OF WHAT THAT MEANS IS. TO ARM THE PROPER LEVEL OF CARE I'M NOT STOPPED WORKING ON THIS BILL. WHETHER THIS THING KEEPS PASSING OR NOT I'M CONTINUING TO LISTEN AND TO TRY TO LEARN AND TO TRY TO MAKE IT BETTER. TO INCORPORATE THE ISSUES THAT ARE. LEGITIMATE WITH RESPECT TO THAT INCLUDING THE ISSUES THAT WERE JUST RAISED HERE TODAY IN THIS COMMITTEE. AND WITH THAT I WOULD ASK FOR NIVEAU. NO THANK YOU SENATOR HERTZBERG THIS IS THE THIRD COMMUNITY PARA MEDICINE FILL THIS COMMITTEE IS CONSIDERED IN THE LAST TWO YEARS AND I APPRECIATE ALL THE HARD WORK THAT'S GONE INTO MOVING THIS ISSUE FORWARD. UNDERSTAND THE STAKEHOLDERS CONCERN FOR PUBLIC PATIENT SAFETY. WHEN THEIR INNOVATIONS IN HOW HEALTH CARE IS PROVIDED USUALLY TAKES AWHILE FOR THE POLICY TO CATCH UP WITH THE PRACTICE? TERRIBLY THE PROCESS FOR DEVELOPING PROGRAMS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL WITH OVERSIGHT REGULATIONS PRIDE PROVIDED BY EMSA ALLOWS FOR SIGNIFICANT INPUT NO OVERSIGHT. WELL THANK YOU FOR ACCEPTING OUR CLARIFYING AMENDMENT WHICH IS PART A AS WELL AS AGREED TO WORK ON LANGUAGE THAT WILL REMOVE THE OVERSIGHT COMMISSION. TRIBALLY DUPLICATES THE WORK OF OF THE COMMISSION ON EM -- THAT DICK AND TO CHANGE THE COMMISSION'S MEMBERSHIP TO PROVIDE NECESSARY EXPERTISE TO OVERSEE COMMUNITY PARA MEDICINE.
