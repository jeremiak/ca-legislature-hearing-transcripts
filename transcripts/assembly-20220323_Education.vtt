THAT THAT WAS GOING TO BE THE

01:31:35.823 --> 01:31:38.860
CASE SO FOR ME TO BE ABLE TO SEE

01:31:38.926 --> 01:31:39.694

01:36:51.805 --> 01:36:53.574
STATE ECONOMIES. INDUSTRY

01:36:53.641 --> 01:36:55.509
CHANGES AND AFFECTS WHAT COURSES

01:36:55.576 --> 01:36:57.645
WE OFFER OR WE DON'T OFFER BASED

01:36:57.711 --> 01:36:59.780
ON LOCAL WORKFORCE NEEDS. FOR

01:36:59.847 --> 01:37:01.315
THIS REASON RP STUDENTS HAVE

01:37:01.382 --> 01:37:02.449
ACCESS TO CLASSES LIKE VIDEO

01:37:02.516 --> 01:37:04.318
GAME ART DESIGN CYBERSECURITY

SPORTS MEDICINE. ROP COURSES AND

01:37:06.887 --> 01:37:08.289
PROGRAMS TO MAXIMIZE THE

01:37:08.355 --> 01:37:09.390
OPPORTUNITY FOR STUDENTS TO

01:37:09.456 --> 01:37:11.525

FURTHER EDUCATION IN THE FIELD

01:37:13.561 --> 01:37:15.396
OF STUDY SO THEY HAVE CAREERS BY

01:37:15.462 --> 01:37:16.830
CHOICE AND NOT BY CHANCE.

01:37:16.897 --> 01:37:18.465
IMPLEMENTING SEARED SENIORITY

01:37:18.532 --> 01:37:19.967
BASED LAYOFFS WOULD FORCE US TO

01:37:20.034 --> 01:37:21.035
RETAIN TEACHERS AND PROGRAMS

01:37:21.101 --> 01:37:23.103
THAT MAY NOT HAVE LABOR MARKET

01:37:23.170 --> 01:37:24.672
DEMAND. OR FOR WHICH THEY DON'T

01:37:24.738 --> 01:37:25.873
HAVE THE PROPER EXPERTISE IN

01:37:25.940 --> 01:37:26.774
TRAINING BECAUSE THE WAY C. G.

01:37:26.840 --> 01:37:28.576
CREDENTIALS ARE STRUCTURED. FOR

01:37:28.642 --> 01:37:30.311
EXAMPLE A TEACHER IN DENTISTRY

01:37:30.377 --> 01:37:32.146

01:37:32.213 --> 01:37:33.847

SAME ICT CREDENTIAL AS A

01:37:39.787 --> 01:37:41.255

NEED TO IMPLEMENT A LAYOFF THAT

01:37:43.157 --> 01:37:44.491
THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE ME TO

01:37:44.558 --> 01:37:45.492
LAY OFF BASED ON SENIORITY AND

01:37:45.559 --> 01:37:47.528
NOT THE COURSE THAT HAS GREATER

01:37:47.595 --> 01:37:48.462
INDUSTRY DEMAND BECAUSE THEY

01:37:48.529 --> 01:37:49.997

UNDERSTAND IT ACTUALLY LAW

01:40:02.262 --> 01:40:03.263
TODAY. DOESN'T NECESSARILY. THE

01:40:03.330 --> 01:40:05.432
LAST IN FIRST OUT. IT'S A

01:40:05.499 --> 01:40:07.234
MISNOMER AND THAT'S- PROMULGATED

01:40:07.301 --> 01:40:09.303
BY GROUPS WHO WANT TO GET

01:40:09.370 --> 01:40:11.305
TEACHERS FROM MY PERSPECTIVE IT

01:40:11.372 --> 01:40:14.274
SAYS IF I'M CORRECT I THINK I AM

01:40:14.341 --> 01:40:16.276
IS LAST IN FIRST OUT AND LAST.

01:40:16.343 --> 01:40:18.045
THAT LOCAL SCHOOL BOARD ADOPTS A

01:40:18.112 --> 01:40:20.681
DIFFERENT POLICY. SO TO BE ON

01:40:20.748 --> 01:40:22.716
THE SCHOOL BOARD TO ADOPT A

01:40:22.783 --> 01:40:25.219

UNDERSTAND YOUR CONCERN. MR

01:40:27.020 --> 01:40:30.657

ELECTED TO THE ASSEMBLY I SAT ON

01:40:31.725 --> 01:40:34.161
A VERY SMALL SCHOOL BOARD- I'M

01:40:34.228 --> 01:40:36.330
STRONGLY OPPOSED BECAUSE I THINK

01:40:36.397 --> 01:40:37.531
WITH IT THIS IS ACTUALLY GONNA

01:40:37.598 --> 01:40:39.500
DO IS WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO LAY A

01:40:39.566 --> 01:40:41.668
TEACHER OFF WITHIN THE FIRST

01:40:41.735 --> 01:40:42.436
YEAR BECAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW I

01:40:42.503 --> 01:40:43.971
HAVE SCHOOLS ROBIN DISTRICT

01:40:44.037 --> 01:40:45.139
THERE WERE FIRES OR SCOLDED WE

01:40:45.205 --> 01:40:47.274
HAD CHILDREN MOVING 30% OF KIDS

01:40:47.341 --> 01:40:48.842
MOVE FROM ONE SCHOOL DISTRICT TO

01:40:48.909 --> 01:40:51.311
ANOTHER SO YOU HAD TO UP YOUR

01:40:51.378 --> 01:40:51.979
TEACHERS AT THAT SCHOOL DISTRICT

01:40:52.045 --> 01:40:53.480
THAT WAS OPENED IN PERSON. THEN

01:40:53.547 --> 01:40:54.815
THERE THEN THE NEXT YEAR YOU'RE

01:40:54.882 --> 01:40:56.283
BUDGET LOOKS DIFFERENTLY BECAUSE

01:40:56.350 --> 01:40:57.484
THOSE CHILDREN HAVE GONE BACK TO

01:40:57.551 --> 01:40:59.553
ANOTHER SCHOOL I THINK THIS IS-

01:40:59.620 --> 01:41:01.622
TIME TO POORLY BECAUSE OUR

01:41:01.688 --> 01:41:02.890
SCHOOLS ARE REELING RIGHT NOW

01:41:02.956 --> 01:41:04.491
AND ARE STILL HAVE A LOT OF

01:41:04.558 --> 01:41:06.527
QUESTIONS ON HOW THEY'RE GOING

01:41:06.593 --> 01:41:07.828
TO BE FUNDED IN THE YEARS TO

01:41:07.895 --> 01:41:09.630

01:41:15.803 --> 01:41:17.638
PERMANENT STATUS FOR ALL OF THEM

01:41:17.704 --> 01:41:18.806
THAT CAME THROUGH BECAUSE I

01:41:18.872 --> 01:41:22.409
VALUE THE WORK THAT YOU DO. BUT-

01:41:22.476 --> 01:41:24.311
BUDGETS ARE WHAT THEY ARE AND

01:41:24.378 --> 01:41:26.113
I'M I AM VERY CONCERNED THIS IS

01:41:26.180 --> 01:41:27.881
ACTUALLY GOING TO HAVE. THE

01:41:27.948 --> 01:41:30.717
OPPOSITE. EFFECT FOR TEACHERS

01:41:30.784 --> 01:41:32.119
ARE GOING TO FEEL EVEN MORE

01:41:32.186 --> 01:41:36.290
LESS- SECURE IN THEIR JOBS

01:41:36.356 --> 01:41:38.425
BECAUSE OUR OUR SMALL SCHOOLS

01:41:38.492 --> 01:41:40.027
WHICH THIS LITERALLY TARGETS MY

01:41:40.093 --> 01:41:42.229

01:42:01.415 --> 01:42:02.683
MEASURE GIVES ONE MORE PIECE OF

01:42:02.749 --> 01:42:04.351

01:42:20.067 --> 01:42:22.035
ADAPT TO MAKE SURE CITY SCHOOLS

01:42:22.102 --> 01:42:22.636
