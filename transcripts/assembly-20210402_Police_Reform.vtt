00:31:46.271 --> 00:31:48.273
WITH THE CALL WITH EVEN FOR

00:31:48.339 --> 00:31:50.208

PUT HIS FEET ON THE BACK OF

00:32:19.937 --> 00:32:22.206
SOME DIALOGUE WITH ME DURING

00:32:22.273 --> 00:32:24.575
WHICH WE ALL ACKNOWLEDGE ANGELO

00:32:24.642 --> 00:32:27.011
DID NOT BELONG IN JAIL. BECAUSE

00:32:27.078 --> 00:32:29.247
HE WAS HAVING A MENTAL HEALTH

00:32:29.314 --> 00:32:31.849
CRISIS. BUT THEY DID NOT CHECK

00:32:31.916 --> 00:32:34.786

CHIP. BUT THEY DID NOT. AFTER

00:32:44.962 --> 00:32:48.166
WHORL THE OFFICER THAT HAD HIS

00:32:48.232 --> 00:32:50.535
KNEE AND WEIGHT ON ABSOLUTE

00:32:50.601 --> 00:32:54.372
RETIRED IN THE ANOTHER OFFICER.

00:32:54.439 --> 00:32:57.608
DO KIDS POLICE ONCE THE

00:32:57.675 --> 00:33:01.279
PARAMEDICS ARRIVED THE REMOVED

00:33:01.346 --> 00:33:03.981
THEIR WAIT FOR AVENGERS THE ACT

00:33:04.048 --> 00:33:06.117
AS THEY TURN THEM OVER HE WAS

00:33:06.184 --> 00:33:09.087
LIAM LEADING FROM HIS MOUTH ANY

00:33:09.153 --> 00:33:13.658
TH ICE ROLLED UP IN HIS HEAD HE

00:33:13.725 --> 00:33:15.993

REMOVE THE HEAD COACH AND

00:33:18.463 --> 00:33:19.964
WITHOUT PERFORMING CPR

MOVE HIM TO A GURNEY WHERE THEY

00:33:26.738 --> 00:33:30.742
BEGIN THE CPR THEY TOOK HIM TO

00:33:30.808 --> 00:33:35.346
THE HOSPITAL. WE BELIEVE THAT

00:33:35.413 --> 00:33:38.182
THE CONDUCT OF THE OFFICERS WAS

00:33:38.249 --> 00:33:39.550
UNNECESSARY FOR TWO MAIN

00:33:39.617 --> 00:33:42.053
REASONS- FIRST THAT THEY

00:44:34.538 --> 00:44:36.306
AND TRAUMA OF THE JOB. AND I

00:44:36.373 --> 00:44:38.575
CAN HONESTLY SAY THAT OVER A

00:44:38.642 --> 00:44:40.077
HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF

00:44:40.144 --> 00:44:43.380

00:44:52.623 --> 00:44:53.991
THE SAME NERVOUS SYSTEM THAT

00:45:00.597 --> 00:45:02.433
TO MAKE VERY CRITICAL DECISIONS

00:45:02.499 --> 00:45:04.635
THEMSELVES. SOMETIMES THOSE

00:45:04.701 --> 00:45:05.869
DECISIONS ARE GOOD AND

00:45:05.936 --> 00:45:07.604
SOMETIMES THEY'RE NOT SO GOOD

00:45:07.671 --> 00:45:10.374
AND AFTERWARDS THEY SPEND THE

00:45:10.441 --> 00:45:12.276
REST OF THEIR LIVES BEATING

00:45:12.342 --> 00:45:16.680

PERSON IS ABUSED THE WHOLE

00:52:01.084 --> 00:52:05.522
ENTIRE FAMILY FEELS THE PAIN.

00:52:05.589 --> 00:52:07.724
POLICE ABUSE OF POWER IF THESE

00:52:07.791 --> 00:52:09.459
DAMAGES TO OUR COMMUNITIES AS

00:52:09.526 --> 00:52:11.761
WELL WHEN LAW ENFORCEMENT ABUSE

THEIR POWER IT CREATES

00:52:13.230 --> 00:52:14.464
ADDITIONAL PROBLEMS FEAR AND

00:52:14.531 --> 00:52:16.800
MISTRUST MISTRUST DAY INDOORS

00:52:16.867 --> 00:52:19.836
YEARS AFTER THE INCIDENT OCCURS

00:52:19.903 --> 00:52:20.904
WHICH FURTHER TO GRACE THE

00:52:20.971 --> 00:52:22.305

SOMEONE IN A BLACK OR BROWN

00:52:27.143 --> 00:52:29.212
COMMUNITY IS A BIG BOTH CRIME.

00:52:29.279 --> 00:52:31.181
WE HAVE TO THINK TWICE ABOUT

00:52:31.248 --> 00:52:32.883
CALLING THE POLICE WE'RE JUST

00:52:32.949 --> 00:52:35.719
SAYING SINCE WE PAY HARD EARNED

00:52:35.785 --> 00:52:38.221
TAX MONEY FOR THEIR SERVICE.

00:52:38.288 --> 00:52:39.856
OUR FIRST THOUGHT IS. CAN WE

00:52:39.923 --> 00:52:42.692
TRUST THEM. IT RECALL POLICE

00:52:42.759 --> 00:52:46.463
WILL THEY ESCALATE OR NOT AND

00:52:46.530 --> 00:52:48.365
YEAH- DE ESCALATE WHEN THEY

00:52:48.431 --> 00:52:50.367
ARREST ME OR HURT ME OR OR

00:52:50.433 --> 00:52:52.335
WORSE KILL ME YOU KNOW AND NOT

00:52:52.402 --> 00:52:54.137
GET THE REAL PERPETRATOR AND

00:52:54.204 --> 00:52:55.238
THIS TRAIN OF THOUGHT AS

00:52:55.305 --> 00:52:58.174
BROUGHT ABOUT BY BAD POLICING

00:52:58.241 --> 00:53:01.545
AND THE OVER USE OF FORCE IN

00:53:01.611 --> 00:53:02.412
OUR BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITIES.

00:53:02.479 --> 00:53:03.980
HI AGAIN HAVE EXPERIENCED THIS

00:53:04.047 --> 00:53:07.150
FIRST HAND- I LIVE IN OAK GROVE

00:53:07.217 --> 00:53:07.617
IS TO THE OUTSIDE OF

00:53:07.684 --> 00:53:09.719
SACRAMENTO. ELEVEN THOUGH

00:53:09.786 --> 00:53:11.688
PRETTY WELL TO DO NEIGHBORHOOD.

00:53:11.755 --> 00:53:13.023
AND SOME YEARS AGO THERE WAS AN

00:53:13.089 --> 00:53:14.858
INCIDENT THAT A RARE INCIDENT

00:53:14.925 --> 00:53:16.426
OCCURRED RON NEED TO CALL THE

00:53:16.493 --> 00:53:18.628
POLICE. AND WHEN I CALLED THEM

00:53:18.695 --> 00:53:20.030
TO REPORT THE CRIME I FELT THE

00:53:20.096 --> 00:53:22.165
NEED TO TELL THE DISPATCHER TO

00:53:22.232 --> 00:53:24.467
LET THE POLICE NOW. AS SHE WAS

00:53:24.534 --> 00:53:29.773
SENDING- THE POLICE THROUGH.

00:53:29.839 --> 00:53:31.474
I'M A ENABLE. AND THE ONLY THE

00:53:31.541 --> 00:53:33.677
HOUSE ARE BLACK. AND THAT WE

00:53:33.743 --> 00:53:36.012
WERE NOT THE SUSPECTS. I WANT

00:53:36.079 --> 00:53:37.514
TO MAKE THAT CLEAR BECAUSE I

00:53:37.581 --> 00:53:39.416
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT I WAS

00:53:39.482 --> 00:53:40.750

WAYS I'M I AM NOT ALONE. THE

00:53:51.394 --> 00:53:53.263
IMPACT OF MISUSE OF AUTHORITY

00:53:53.330 --> 00:53:55.131
IS THAT. WE DON'T KNOW WHERE

00:53:55.198 --> 00:53:57.767
THE TERMS. YOUR REAL BALLPARK

00:53:57.834 --> 00:53:59.336

00:54:01.037 --> 00:54:03.840
FEARFUL. ALL FOUR LINES. AND

00:54:03.907 --> 00:54:05.208

THAT IS THE- TO BLACK PEOPLE

00:54:17.354 --> 00:54:18.488
BLACK MEN AND WOMEN ARE STILL

00:54:18.555 --> 00:54:20.991

00:54:21.057 --> 00:54:22.659
TEST AND I'M SORRY IT'S OKAY

00:54:22.726 --> 00:54:26.062
HOW LAW ENFORCEMENT TREATS US.

BURKE GOES DARK OR CHARGES MATT

01:01:02.458 --> 01:01:05.028
AGAIN AS PART OF THE RECOVERY.

01:01:05.094 --> 01:01:09.599
ASPECT WHEN- AN OFFICER- YES

01:01:24.013 --> 01:01:28.084
PREVIOUS QUESTION. IF POSSIBLE-

01:01:28.151 --> 01:01:29.919
IN REGARDS AND I THINK IT'S I'M

01:01:29.986 --> 01:01:31.154

01:01:31.220 --> 01:01:33.856
QUESTIONS AND WITH MY ANSWER- I

01:01:33.923 --> 01:01:34.657
THINK IT'S GOING TO TAKE A

01:01:34.724 --> 01:01:36.426
NUMBER OF THINGS TO MAKE

01:01:36.492 --> 01:01:37.794
FAMILIES FEEL LIKE THEY'RE

01:01:37.860 --> 01:01:39.562
GETTING WHAT THEY NEED OUT OF-

01:01:39.629 --> 01:01:41.297
THE SITUATION LIKE THE INCIDENT

01:01:41.364 --> 01:01:42.398
THAT THEY'VE EXPERIENCED IT'S

01:01:42.465 --> 01:01:43.633
GONNA THINK THEY'RE GONNA NEED

01:01:43.699 --> 01:01:45.034
MENTAL HEALTH HELP. THEY'RE

01:01:45.101 --> 01:01:46.836
GONNA NEED TIME TO BE ABLE TO

01:01:46.903 --> 01:01:48.571
TRY TO HEAL AND BE ABLE TO TAKE

01:01:48.638 --> 01:01:49.238
CARE OF THEMSELVES OF MONEY

01:01:49.305 --> 01:01:51.340
FINANCIAL HELP- BUT THEY ALSO

01:01:51.407 --> 01:01:53.709
NEED TO SEE JUSTICE. AND NO

01:01:53.776 --> 01:01:55.845
JUSTICE MEANS NOT JUST WINNING

01:01:55.912 --> 01:01:58.314
A LAWSUIT BUT IN ITS I'M NOT

01:01:58.381 --> 01:01:59.449
SAYING ANYTHING ABOUT LAWSUITS

01:01:59.515 --> 01:02:01.484
I MEAN YOU KNOW WHATEVER THAT

01:02:01.551 --> 01:02:02.418
FAMILY WANTS TO PURSUE IS WHAT

01:02:02.485 --> 01:02:04.153
THEY SHOULD GET. BUT JUSTICE

01:02:04.220 --> 01:02:06.222
MEANS THAT THE OFFICERS THAT

01:02:06.289 --> 01:02:08.458
THAT GREW INTO THEIR TO THE

01:02:08.524 --> 01:02:09.625
SITUATION THAT PUT THEM IN THE

01:02:09.692 --> 01:02:13.763
SITUATION THEY NEED TO SEE SOME

01:02:13.830 --> 01:02:16.532
TYPE OF- REPERCUSSIONS THEY

01:02:16.599 --> 01:02:17.533
NEED TO SEE THAT THOSE OFFICERS

01:02:17.600 --> 01:02:19.035
ARE PENALIZED. THAT THEY'RE

01:02:19.102 --> 01:02:21.437
TREATED AS IF IT WAS BIKE IF I

01:02:21.504 --> 01:02:23.239
GO OUT AND SHOOT SOMEBODY OR-

01:02:23.306 --> 01:02:24.707
YOU KNOW PUT MY KNEE ON

01:02:24.774 --> 01:02:27.143
SOMEBODY'S NECK UNTIL THEY DIE-

01:02:27.210 --> 01:02:28.945
HOW WOULD I BE TREATED. WHAT I

01:02:29.011 --> 01:02:30.213
HAVE TO I WOULD HAVE TO GO TO

01:02:30.279 --> 01:02:32.348
THE COURTS I WOULD HAVE TO- YOU

01:02:32.415 --> 01:02:34.117
KNOW HAVE A JURY LISTEN TO MY

01:02:34.183 --> 01:02:35.885
TRIAL AND THEN I WOULD GET A

01:02:35.952 --> 01:02:37.687
PUNISHMENT THAT. SEEMS

01:02:37.753 --> 01:02:39.055
EFFICIENT FOR THE CRIME THAT I

01:02:39.122 --> 01:02:40.590
COMMITTED SO I THINK THAT'S

01:02:40.656 --> 01:02:42.358
PART OF THE PROCESS THAT'S BEEN

01:02:42.425 --> 01:02:43.860
MISSING AND THAT'S NEEDED. AND

01:02:43.926 --> 01:02:45.094
THAT'S GOING TO BE WHAT HELPS

01:02:45.161 --> 01:02:47.029
HEAL FAMILIES IT WON'T NONE OF

01:02:47.096 --> 01:02:49.398
THOSE THINGS. ALONE WORK I

01:02:49.465 --> 01:02:51.134
DON'T THINK I DON'T THINK JUST

01:02:51.200 --> 01:02:54.070
YOU KNOW SEEING. THE OFFICER GO

01:02:54.137 --> 01:02:55.304
THROUGH THAT PROCESS IS GOING

01:02:55.371 --> 01:02:56.506
TO HELP HEAL THE FAMILIES BY

01:02:56.572 --> 01:02:58.541
ITSELF. BUT IT ALL THOSE THINGS

01:02:58.608 --> 01:02:59.809
TOGETHER ARE GOING TO HELP TO

01:02:59.876 --> 01:03:03.679
BRING THOSE FAMILIES TO- TO A

01:03:03.746 --> 01:03:05.948
BETTER SPACE. THANK YOU VERY

01:03:06.015 --> 01:03:08.184
MUCH DOES ANYONE ELSE WANT TO

01:03:08.251 --> 01:03:10.887
ELABORATE ON THAT QUESTION- WE

01:03:10.953 --> 01:03:13.256
WILL GO TO- HERE IN THE

01:03:13.322 --> 01:03:15.224
AUDIENCE- WE SEE- MISTER

01:03:15.291 --> 01:03:19.395
COLLINS- PLEASE PROCEED. THANK

01:03:19.462 --> 01:03:20.029
YOU VERY MUCH ASSEMBLY MEMBER

01:03:20.096 --> 01:03:23.533
GIPSON- YEAH I JUST TO. WANT TO

01:03:23.599 --> 01:03:24.734
GET THE PERSPECTIVE THAT IT'S

01:03:24.800 --> 01:03:25.968
BEYOND THE FAMILY I THINK WHAT

01:03:26.035 --> 01:03:27.436
WE'VE EXPERIENCED IS SO MUCH

01:03:27.503 --> 01:03:31.474
COMMUNITY SUPPORT- AND- BUT

01:03:31.541 --> 01:03:33.276
IT'S ALSO BECAUSE THE COMMUNITY

01:03:33.342 --> 01:03:35.111
ITSELF IS INJURED BY THIS

01:03:35.178 --> 01:03:36.646
SITUATION I THINK WHAT WE NEED

01:03:36.712 --> 01:03:38.381
FOR THAT IS A SENSE THAT THE

01:03:38.447 --> 01:03:40.816
SYSTEM IS JUST A SENSE THAT THE

01:03:40.883 --> 01:03:44.253
SYSTEM WILL INVESTIGATE ITSELF

01:03:44.320 --> 01:03:47.190
AND CAN CORRECT ANY WRONGS- SO

01:03:47.256 --> 01:03:48.257
FOR THE FAMILY THERE'S JUST

01:03:48.324 --> 01:03:49.959
DON'T NORMAL GRIEVING BUT WHEN

01:03:50.026 --> 01:03:52.962
YOU FEEL. THAT JUSTICE IS IN

01:03:53.029 --> 01:03:54.497
BEING CARRIED OUT AND YOU CAN'T

01:03:54.564 --> 01:03:56.899
TRUST A SYSTEM THAT MAKES THE

01:03:56.966 --> 01:03:59.835
PAIN THAT MUCH GREATER BUT I

01:03:59.902 --> 01:04:01.304
THINK IT'S NOT AGAIN JUST ABOUT

01:04:01.370 --> 01:04:02.772
THE FAMILY I THINK IT'S ABOUT

01:04:02.838 --> 01:04:05.007
THE COMMUNITY IN MANY WAYS WE

01:04:05.074 --> 01:04:06.342
HAVE BEEN APPROACHED BY SO MANY

01:04:06.409 --> 01:04:07.777
OTHER FAMILIES WHO HAVE NOT

01:04:07.843 --> 01:04:09.512
COME FORWARD BEFORE WHO HAVE

01:04:09.579 --> 01:04:11.747
NOT BEEN UP PUBLIC IN THEIR

01:04:11.814 --> 01:04:14.917
SUFFERING- SO WE KNOW WE HAVE

01:04:14.984 --> 01:04:16.485
MANY PEOPLE IN THE SAME

01:04:16.552 --> 01:04:17.820
SITUATION BUT WHAT'S SHOCKING

01:04:17.887 --> 01:04:19.855
IS. ONE OUTPOURING OF SUPPORT

01:04:19.922 --> 01:04:21.157
WE HAD FROM PEOPLE THAT KNEW

01:04:21.224 --> 01:04:23.259
ANGELO AND SOMETHING ABOUT ALL

01:04:23.326 --> 01:04:24.327
OF THIS COMMUNITY MEMBERS THAT

01:04:24.393 --> 01:04:26.195
ARE HAVING DOUBTS ABOUT THE

01:04:26.262 --> 01:04:28.331
SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE AND I THINK

01:04:28.397 --> 01:04:29.732
THAT THE NUMBER ONE THING WE

01:04:29.799 --> 01:04:31.634
CAN DO FOR JUSTICE MAKING SURE

01:04:31.701 --> 01:04:32.802
THAT WHEN THAT SYSTEM MAKES

01:04:32.868 --> 01:04:34.670
MISTAKES WHEN THE IT NEEDS TO

01:04:34.737 --> 01:04:36.872
CORRECT DIRECTION IT IS ABLE TO

01:04:36.939 --> 01:04:40.576
DO SO IT DOESN'T CLOSE INTERNET

01:04:40.643 --> 01:04:41.744
SOFT. AND JUST. ATTACKED JUST

01:04:41.811 --> 01:04:45.715
QUO IT HAS TO. MAKE CHANGES

01:04:45.781 --> 01:04:47.016
LIKE ANY SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE

01:04:47.083 --> 01:04:48.217
AND WE NEED A SYSTEM WE CAN

01:04:48.284 --> 01:04:50.519
TRUST WE NEED A SYSTEM THAT WE

01:04:50.586 --> 01:04:52.221
THINK IS JUST AND I THINK

01:04:52.288 --> 01:04:54.423
THAT'S THE NUMBER ONE. THINK

01:04:54.490 --> 01:04:55.358
THAT YOU KNOW YOU CAN'T BRING

01:04:55.424 --> 01:04:57.193
ANGELA BACK BUT THAT IS THE

01:04:57.260 --> 01:04:58.461
MOST IMPORTANT THING I THINK

01:04:58.527 --> 01:05:00.630
FOR THE COMMUNITY TO HEAL. IS

01:05:00.696 --> 01:05:02.698
TO BE ABLE TO REGAIN TRUST IN.

01:05:02.765 --> 01:05:04.900
THE SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE- AND I

01:05:04.967 --> 01:05:05.901
THINK FOR THAT WE NEED TO MAKE

01:05:05.968 --> 01:05:07.937
SOME REFORMS BECAUSE WE DON'T

01:05:08.004 --> 01:05:08.904
HAVE ENOUGH INDEPENDENT

01:05:08.971 --> 01:05:11.073
OVERSIGHT WE DON'T HAVE-

01:05:11.140 --> 01:05:13.442
OFTENTIMES. THERE'S TOO MUCH.

01:05:13.509 --> 01:05:16.279
OF IT YOU KNOW THEY'RE THERE

01:05:16.345 --> 01:05:17.346
YOU KNOW WHAT WE WERE TOLD THIS

01:05:17.413 --> 01:05:19.482
I'M SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS AND FOR

01:05:19.548 --> 01:05:21.350
THE COVER UP THAT ONE SUIT.

01:05:21.417 --> 01:05:27.123
THIS OF THE MESSAGES WE'VEGOTTEN FROM OTHER FAMILIES- AND-SO WERE. WERE A LITTLE BIT

01:05:27.189 --> 01:05:28.424
WORRIED MORE THAN A LITTLE BIT

01:05:28.491 --> 01:05:29.959
WORRIED THAT THE SYSTEM ITSELF

01:05:30.026 --> 01:05:32.128
WON'T BE ABLE TO CORRECT. ITS

01:05:32.194 --> 01:05:33.896
OWN PROBLEMS AND THAT'S WHY I

01:05:33.963 --> 01:05:34.730
THINK YOU FOR HAVING THIS

01:05:34.797 --> 01:05:36.899
HEARINGS AND- AND BRING THIS

01:05:36.966 --> 01:05:37.767
ISSUES THAT ARE REALLY

01:05:37.833 --> 01:05:40.069
DIFFICULT FORWARD- YOU KNOW

01:05:40.136 --> 01:05:41.304
THEIR BABY DOUBLE DIGITS FOR

01:05:41.370 --> 01:05:42.371
EVERYONE INVOLVED THE POLICE

01:05:42.438 --> 01:05:44.173
OFFICERS. AND THE FAMILIES BUT

01:05:44.240 --> 01:05:47.910
WE NEED A SYSTEM THAT CAN THAT

01:05:47.977 --> 01:05:48.544
CAN RECTIFY ITSELF. THANK YOU.

01:05:48.611 --> 01:05:49.612
THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THAT'S

01:05:49.679 --> 01:05:50.746
THE REASON WHY WE'RE HERE.

01:05:50.813 --> 01:05:52.548
WE'RE HERE TRYING TO. SEE HOW

01:05:52.615 --> 01:05:54.717
WE CAN CORRECT THE SYSTEM. AND

01:05:54.784 --> 01:05:57.153
MAKE THE SYSTEM BETTER- I WANT

01:05:57.219 --> 01:05:59.288
TO GO TO OUR LINE WE HAVE A

01:05:59.355 --> 01:06:01.624
MAJORITY LEADER- MISS ELOISE

01:06:01.691 --> 01:06:03.326
RASCAL I'M SORRY JUST HOLD ON

01:06:03.392 --> 01:06:05.628
ONE MOMENT I WANTED TO FOR TO-

01:06:05.695 --> 01:06:06.629
I WANNA GO TO MISTER TOM LACKEY

01:06:06.696 --> 01:06:08.631
WAS WITH US. AND THEN I'LL GO

01:06:08.698 --> 01:06:19.875
TO MYSTERIOUS. THERE'S A REASON

01:06:19.942 --> 01:06:24.180
THAT- THIS PROBLEM HAS EXISTED

01:06:24.246 --> 01:06:24.980
FOR A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF

01:06:25.047 --> 01:06:27.450
TIME THERE'S JUST A LOT OF

01:06:27.516 --> 01:06:29.552
MISUNDERSTANDING ON MANY

01:06:29.618 --> 01:06:31.020
FRIENDS BECAUSE YOU'RE YOU'RE

01:06:31.087 --> 01:06:33.055
DEALING WITH SUCH A VERY VERY

01:06:33.122 --> 01:06:34.824
DELICATE EMOTIONS YOU'RE YOU'RE

01:06:34.890 --> 01:06:37.026
DEALING WITH FEAR YOU'RE

01:06:37.093 --> 01:06:40.529
DEALING WITH- ANGER AND OFTEN

01:06:40.596 --> 01:06:44.133
TIMES VIOLENCE. AND WHAT

01:06:44.200 --> 01:06:46.068
HAPPENS IS I THINK THINGS COULD

01:06:46.135 --> 01:06:47.236
BE MIS CHARACTERIZED

01:06:47.303 --> 01:06:48.504
MISUNDERSTOOD BECAUSE OF THE

01:06:48.571 --> 01:06:50.373
VOLATILITY OF WHAT WE'RE

01:06:50.439 --> 01:06:53.142
TALKING ABOUT BUT WHAT I THINK

01:06:53.209 --> 01:06:55.077
IS VERY VERY VERY VITAL IS THAT

01:06:55.144 --> 01:06:59.915
WE- WE'RE ABLE TO OPENLY. SB

01:06:59.982 --> 01:07:02.084
TRANSPARENT FROM BOTH SIDES AND

01:07:02.151 --> 01:07:05.755
BE SYMPATHETIC TO BOTH SIDES

01:07:05.821 --> 01:07:06.389
BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S WHEN YOU

01:07:06.455 --> 01:07:09.492
GET REMEDY- IF IT IF IT BECOMES

01:07:09.558 --> 01:07:12.561
TOO LOPSIDED. THEN I THINK

01:07:12.628 --> 01:07:13.763
SOMETIMES OUR VISION GETS

01:07:13.829 --> 01:07:16.132
BLURRY SO I'M HOPING THAT WE

01:07:16.198 --> 01:07:17.733
CAN HAVE CLARITY AND THAT WE

01:07:17.800 --> 01:07:19.802
CAN BE HONEST AND THAT WE CAN

01:07:19.869 --> 01:07:21.937

THAT REGARD. AND THAT THAT'S

01:17:11.293 --> 01:17:13.528

TO THE VICTIM TO CHANGE THEIR

01:17:21.136 --> 01:17:23.605

OUR COMMUNITIES. ESPECIALLY ARE

01:17:37.686 --> 01:17:39.054
BROWN AND BLACK COMMUNITIES

01:17:39.121 --> 01:17:43.291
THAT- BY BY ALL INDICATIONS BY

01:17:43.358 --> 01:17:44.860
ALL STATISTICS ARE THE ONES

01:17:44.926 --> 01:17:46.628

MISTER CHAIR FOR ALLOWING ME TO

01:17:52.034 --> 01:18:10.619
SHARE A FEW COMMENTS.

01:18:25.634 --> 01:18:26.735
THE

01:18:26.802 --> 01:18:30.439
RELATIONSHIP- OUR JOB IS TO

01:18:30.505 --> 01:18:33.175
PASS LEGISLATION IT ISN'T IT TO

01:18:33.241 --> 01:18:34.576
BE ON THE GROUND ALTHOUGH ALL

01:18:34.643 --> 01:18:35.811
OF US I AND ALL OF MY

01:18:35.877 --> 01:18:37.846
COLLEAGUES AND I SPEND A LOT OF

01:18:37.913 --> 01:18:40.182
TIME IN THE COMMUNITY. BUT WHAT

01:18:40.248 --> 01:18:42.350
IS IT WE CAN DO IS LEGISLATORS

01:18:42.417 --> 01:18:44.586
TO IMPROVE THIS RELATIONSHIP-

01:18:44.653 --> 01:18:46.888
BETWEEN LAW ENFORCEMENT AND THE

01:18:46.955 --> 01:18:50.459
COMMUNITY. I THINK THAT IT'S

01:18:50.525 --> 01:18:52.527
IMPORTANT TO VIEW. LAW

01:18:52.594 --> 01:18:54.096
ENFORCEMENT AS A SYSTEM INSTEAD

01:18:54.162 --> 01:18:55.397
OF AN INDIVIDUAL LIKE

01:18:55.464 --> 01:18:57.032
INDIVIDUAL OFFICERS BECAUSE

01:18:57.099 --> 01:18:59.067
IT'S A SYSTEM THAT ALLOWS FOR

01:18:59.134 --> 01:19:00.769
OFFICERS WHETHER THEY'RE GOOD

01:19:00.836 --> 01:19:02.070
OR BAD TO DO WHATEVER IT IS

01:19:02.137 --> 01:19:04.573
THAT THEY'VE DONE AND SO THAT'S

01:19:04.639 --> 01:19:05.207
WHERE THE PROBLEM IS AND THAT'S

01:19:05.273 --> 01:19:07.042
THE ROOT OF THE PROBLEM- AND I

01:19:07.109 --> 01:19:09.244
THINK THAT'S WHAT LEGISLATORS

01:19:09.311 --> 01:19:10.645
CAN DO IS TO HELP FIX RID OF

01:19:10.712 --> 01:19:12.747
THE PROBLEM. ISSUES AYE WE SEE

01:19:12.814 --> 01:19:14.549
A LOT OF BANDAIDS WE SEE A LOT

01:19:14.616 --> 01:19:17.786
OF- YOU KNOW TEMPORARY FIXES OR

01:19:17.853 --> 01:19:18.587
YOU KNOW GOOD STATEMENTS ARE

01:19:18.653 --> 01:19:20.889
PERFORMATIVE GESTURES- BUT WE

01:19:20.956 --> 01:19:23.191
NEED TO SEE ACTUAL ROOT OF THE

01:19:23.258 --> 01:19:26.495
PROBLEM FIXES WHERE LAWS ARE

01:19:26.561 --> 01:19:27.829
ACTUALLY BEING MADE THAT.

01:19:27.896 --> 01:19:29.598
HONESTLY I FEEL LIKE. IF THERE

01:19:29.664 --> 01:19:30.866
IS A PUNISHMENT IN PLACE FOR

01:19:30.932 --> 01:19:33.235
OFFICERS THAT. HARM PEOPLE IN

01:19:33.301 --> 01:19:35.070
THE COMMUNITY AND I FEEL LIKE.

01:19:35.137 --> 01:19:37.139
THAT THE HARM WILL STOP ITS

01:19:37.205 --> 01:19:39.007
OFFICERS KNOW THAT THEY WILL.

01:19:39.074 --> 01:19:40.675
BE FIRED AND POSSIBLY BE

01:19:40.742 --> 01:19:43.311
INCARCERATED. FOR MURDERING

01:19:43.378 --> 01:19:45.480
SOMEBODY THEN THAT WILL STOP.

01:19:45.547 --> 01:19:47.582
IT'LL MAKE THEM THINK TWICE-

01:19:47.649 --> 01:19:50.752
BEFORE DOING ANYTHING AND- IT

01:19:50.819 --> 01:19:52.687
DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN THAT.

01:19:52.754 --> 01:19:54.222
YOU KNOW ALL THESE OFFICERS ARE

01:19:54.289 --> 01:19:55.223
GOING TO GO TO JAIL NOW LET'S

01:19:55.290 --> 01:19:56.791
GET IT IT'S IT MEANS THAT

01:19:56.858 --> 01:19:58.827
OFFICERS WILL NO LONGER JUMP

01:19:58.894 --> 01:20:00.862
TO. RESORTING TO EXCESSIVE

01:20:00.929 --> 01:20:02.898
FORCE OR VIOLENCE ON THE FIRST

01:20:02.964 --> 01:20:05.033
RESPONSE SO I THINK IN

01:20:05.100 --> 01:20:06.301
EVERYBODY'S LIFE WE ALL HAVE

01:20:06.368 --> 01:20:08.003
JOBS THAT WE DO AND WE ALL HAVE

01:20:08.069 --> 01:20:09.804
CHALLENGES ON OUR JOBS AND WE

01:20:09.871 --> 01:20:10.939
HAVE TO MAKE DECISIONS ON OUR

01:20:11.006 --> 01:20:12.307
CHALLENGES AND WE ALWAYS THINK

01:20:12.374 --> 01:20:13.642
ABOUT AM I GOING TO LOSE MY JOB

01:20:13.708 --> 01:20:15.143
IF I MAKE THIS BAD DECISION.

01:20:15.210 --> 01:20:16.745
AND SO THAT'S WHAT I THINK THAT

01:20:16.811 --> 01:20:17.379
OFFICERS NEED TO HAVE THE SAME

01:20:17.445 --> 01:20:21.550

01:25:07.702 --> 01:25:12.006
OFFICERS- YOU KNOW REALLY

01:25:12.073 --> 01:25:15.710
STRUGGLE WITH. AND SO MAKING

01:25:15.777 --> 01:25:16.911
SURE THAT THOSE OFFICERS GET

01:25:16.978 --> 01:25:18.646
THE HELP THAT THEY NEED BECAUSE

01:25:18.713 --> 01:25:21.816
THAT WAY THEY'RE LESS LIKELY TO

01:25:21.883 --> 01:25:24.519
USE THAT PROPERTY OWNERS- AND

01:25:24.586 --> 01:25:26.221
HAVING THEM MENTORED BY THOSE

01:25:26.287 --> 01:25:28.256
GOOD OFFICERS THAT ARE ABLE TO

01:25:28.323 --> 01:25:29.724
COMMUNICATE WITH THEIR

01:25:29.791 --> 01:25:33.161
COMMUNITY EFFECTIVELY- AND- TO

01:25:33.228 --> 01:25:35.630
BRING UITY TO THAT COMMUNITY.

01:25:35.697 --> 01:25:37.031
I THINK THAT MENTORING

01:25:37.098 --> 01:25:39.601
PROCESSES GOOD MENTAL ALL CHECK

01:25:39.667 --> 01:25:40.502
INS I THINK ARE REALLY

01:25:40.568 --> 01:25:42.804
IMPORTANT I DO WELL LET'S CHECK

01:25:42.871 --> 01:25:45.573
IN WITH A COUPLE OF DEPARTMENTS

01:25:45.640 --> 01:25:47.942
AND I THINK THOSE ARE IMPORTANT

01:25:48.009 --> 01:25:49.611
BECAUSE THEY ACTUALLY HELP THE

01:25:49.677 --> 01:25:51.212
COPS BECAUSE MENTALLY HEALTHY

01:25:51.279 --> 01:25:53.414
COPS RESPOND. AN APPROPRIATE

01:25:53.481 --> 01:25:56.918
WAY AND SO THAT I THINK IS VERY

01:25:56.985 --> 01:25:59.521
IMPORTANT TO BRING HEALING TO

01:25:59.587 --> 01:26:03.124
BALK BOB GOOD- BUT THERE ARE A

01:26:03.191 --> 01:26:04.893
LOT OF OFFICE THAT ARE

01:26:04.959 --> 01:26:06.494
STRUGGLING WITH PTSD AND

01:26:06.561 --> 01:26:10.064
DEPRESSION ON THEM. AND THAT

01:26:10.131 --> 01:26:12.367
THAT ALSO GOING TO INFLUENCE

01:26:12.433 --> 01:26:13.635
THEIR RESPONSES TO THE

01:26:13.701 --> 01:26:16.337
COMMUNITY- I THINK THESE ARE

01:26:16.404 --> 01:26:18.139
IMPORTANT TOPICS AND THE MORE

01:26:18.206 --> 01:26:21.109

01:27:33.982 --> 01:27:36.317
ABSOLUTELY AND I HAVE MET WITH

01:27:36.384 --> 01:27:37.919
MANY OFFICERS AFTER THEY HAVE

01:27:37.986 --> 01:27:39.654
BEEN IN A SHOOTING AND I'VE

01:27:39.721 --> 01:27:43.057
ALSO TREATED THEIR- OFFICERS

01:27:43.124 --> 01:27:45.660
BUT SIGNIFICANT PTS. AFTER

01:27:45.727 --> 01:27:47.095
THEY'VE DONE IN THIS YEAR ALONE

01:27:47.161 --> 01:27:50.198
AND SO HELPING- THEM TO RE

01:27:50.264 --> 01:27:52.233
CALIBRATE THEIR SYSTEM SET UP

01:27:52.300 --> 01:27:54.068
AND TAKE THE NUMBER OF DAYS FOR

01:27:54.135 --> 01:27:56.504
THAT OFFICER TO. COMPLETELY

01:27:56.571 --> 01:27:58.272
COME DOWN FROM THAT MUCH OF

01:27:58.339 --> 01:27:59.841
ADRENALINE AND THAT MUCH

CORTISOL THE NEEDS. AND FELL ON

01:28:02.510 --> 01:28:04.178
AVERAGE IT TAKES ABOUT TEN DAYS

01:28:04.245 --> 01:28:05.613
ACCORDING TO THE LETTERS CARE

01:28:05.680 --> 01:28:09.083
SELL. OUT SOMETIMES DEPARTMENT-

01:28:09.150 --> 01:28:12.086
MAYBE ARE NOT AS AWARE OF SOME

01:28:12.153 --> 01:28:13.988
OF THOSE- RESEARCH FINDINGS

01:28:14.055 --> 01:28:16.557
HIMSELF. HELPING OFFICERS TO BE

01:28:16.624 --> 01:28:18.326
ABLE TO TAKE A FEW DAYS TOP TO

01:28:18.393 --> 01:28:19.861
BE ABLE TO RECALIBRATE SO

01:28:19.927 --> 01:28:21.162
THEY'RE NOT GOING BACK IN THE

01:28:21.229 --> 01:28:26.267
FIELD- YOU KNOW VERY- EXHAUSTED

01:28:26.334 --> 01:28:28.770
AND NOT ABLE TO FUNCTION IN A

01:28:28.836 --> 01:28:30.605
FULL CAPACITY I THINK IS VERY

01:28:30.672 --> 01:28:33.708
IMPORTANT. AND ALSO HELPING

01:28:33.775 --> 01:28:36.110
THEM TO DEAL WITH THE DECISIONS

01:28:36.177 --> 01:28:37.879
THAT THEY THEY MADE WHETHER

01:28:37.945 --> 01:28:38.813
THEY WERE GOOD AND BAD

01:28:38.880 --> 01:28:47.155
DECISIONS AT. THAT MOMENT- GO

01:28:47.221 --> 01:28:53.261
AHEAD. OKAY NO CREDIT. OKAY SO

01:28:53.327 --> 01:28:57.498
I THINK- HELPING DAMAGE- GOOD

01:28:57.565 --> 01:29:00.601
TO BEGIN WITH WHICH IS THE-

01:29:00.668 --> 01:29:02.670
MUTUALLY ARETHA OF TRYING- BUT

01:29:02.737 --> 01:29:04.305
ALSO THEM TO COMPLY BECAUSE

01:29:04.372 --> 01:29:08.009
BEST THEY GO ON- I WERE TALK

01:29:08.076 --> 01:29:10.044
EXTENSIVELY TO OFFICERS AND

01:29:10.111 --> 01:29:11.612
MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE READY TO

01:29:11.679 --> 01:29:13.081
RETURN TO FULL DUTY BECAUSE

01:29:13.147 --> 01:29:16.517
RETURNING THEM- SOMETIMES SMALL

01:29:16.584 --> 01:29:19.721
DEPARTMENT- THEY THEY DON'T

01:29:19.787 --> 01:29:21.456
HAVE THE LUXURY OF LETTING THEM

01:29:21.522 --> 01:29:23.357
STAY OSCAR VERY LONG BECAUSE

01:29:23.424 --> 01:29:26.427
THEY HAVE SUCH SHORT STAFFING-

01:29:26.494 --> 01:29:28.329
SO I THINK THAT IS A

01:29:28.396 --> 01:29:31.466
SIGNIFICANT ISSUE- AND ALSO

01:29:31.532 --> 01:29:33.234
HAVING DEPARTMENTS UNDERSTAND

01:29:33.301 --> 01:29:35.336
THAT AN OFFICER DOES NEED TIME

01:29:35.403 --> 01:29:37.472
TO RECOVER. AND ALSO IF THERE

01:29:37.538 --> 01:29:38.740
WAS A TRAINING ISSUE OR THEY

01:29:38.806 --> 01:29:39.941
DID SOMETHING THAT WASN'T

01:29:40.007 --> 01:29:41.743
CORRECT MAKES BUT THAT THEY

01:29:41.809 --> 01:29:47.915
HAVE THE PROPER TRAINING AND.

01:29:47.982 --> 01:29:49.250

BACK TO WORK IS THERE A TIME

01:30:02.797 --> 01:30:03.931
BECAUSE YOU MAKE MENTION

01:30:03.998 --> 01:30:05.867
SMALLER DEPARTMENTS THEY NEED

01:30:05.933 --> 01:30:08.069
THAT OFFICER BACK SO THE TIME

01:30:08.136 --> 01:30:09.604

01:44:16.149 --> 01:44:18.085
POINT. BUT QUITE FRANKLY THESE

COLOR AND HOW HISTORICALLY WE

01:44:41.441 --> 01:44:43.977
HAVE BEEN ON THE WRONG SIDE OF

01:44:44.044 --> 01:44:45.912
HISTORY AND HOW WE HAVE USED.

01:44:45.979 --> 01:44:48.148

CONTEMPORARILY IT HAPPENS IN

01:45:08.435 --> 01:45:09.970

ISSUES. AND WE DON'T ALWAYS

01:47:31.378 --> 01:47:33.580
HAVE TO USE. THE LAW AS

01:47:33.647 --> 01:47:36.650
LEVERAGE. TO TRY TO IMPROVE

01:47:36.716 --> 01:47:37.150
SAFETY OF THE COMMUNITY.

01:47:37.217 --> 01:47:38.885
SOMETIMES IT'S- EVIDENCE OF

01:47:38.952 --> 01:47:40.821
SOMEONE TO A RESOURCE. THAT

01:47:40.887 --> 01:47:41.421
COULD GET THEM OUT OF THEIR

01:47:41.488 --> 01:47:42.656
SITUATION WHETHER IT'S-

01:47:42.722 --> 01:47:44.357
SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER WHAT IT

01:47:44.424 --> 01:47:45.625
MUST'VE VIOLENCE OR WHETHER

IT'S HOMELESSNESS. AND NOT

01:47:47.327 --> 01:47:48.662

01:47:48.728 --> 01:47:51.331
SYSTEM. AS A WAY TO REMOVE. THE

01:47:51.398 --> 01:47:52.966

DOCTOR PORTER MENTIONED THIS IS

01:48:02.142 --> 01:48:03.643
ACCOUNTABILITY AT THE END OF

TO A DEATH IT COULD BE JUST A

01:48:19.159 --> 01:48:20.627
POLICY THAT WAS VIOLATED BUT

01:48:20.694 --> 01:48:22.195
NOBODY WOULD KNOW ABOUT OTHER

01:48:22.262 --> 01:48:23.029
THAN THE PEOPLE IN THAT

01:48:23.096 --> 01:48:24.931
DEPARTMENT. AND SO THE CHIEF IS

01:48:24.998 --> 01:48:25.932
THE MOST IMPORTANT PERSON WHEN

01:48:25.999 --> 01:48:28.602
IT COMES TO HOW OFFICERS BEHAVE

01:48:28.668 --> 01:48:30.303
INSIDE AND OUTSIDE THE PART.

01:48:30.370 --> 01:48:31.238
BECAUSE OFFICERS NEED TO

01:48:31.304 --> 01:48:32.906
UNDERSTAND THAT ONE DAY WILL BE

01:48:32.973 --> 01:48:34.107

01:48:36.142 --> 01:48:37.210
WITH OUR MORES AND OUR

01:48:37.277 --> 01:48:38.845
PRINCIPLES. BUT ALSO THEY WILL

01:48:38.912 --> 01:48:39.646
BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE WHEN THEY

01:48:39.713 --> 01:48:40.747
DO NOT. AND WHETHER THAT'S

01:48:40.814 --> 01:48:42.115
SOMETHING SMALLER THAT

01:48:42.182 --> 01:48:43.183
SOMETHING LARGE THEY WILL BE

01:48:43.250 --> 01:48:45.218
HELD ACCOUNTABLE AND I THINK.

01:48:45.285 --> 01:48:46.686
OUR ASSOCIATION IS MOVING IN

01:48:46.753 --> 01:48:48.488

TRANSPARENCY. ACCOUNTABILITY

01:48:53.026 --> 01:48:54.995
WILL FOLLOW. AND ONCE THE

01:48:57.030 --> 01:48:57.564

FEARFUL OF THEIR INTERACTIONS

01:49:12.479 --> 01:49:13.713
WITH THE POLICE BECAUSE THEY

01:49:13.780 --> 01:49:14.314
UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY'RE TO BE

01:49:14.381 --> 01:49:16.182

01:57:05.017 --> 01:57:07.854
UNSUBSTANTIATED VIOLENCE IS A

01:57:07.920 --> 01:57:10.957
BOLD VIOLATION OF A UNIQUELY

DIFFERENT APPROACH IT ASKING

01:57:56.836 --> 01:57:59.138
QUESTIONS LIKE WHICH

01:57:59.205 --> 01:58:00.840
RELATIONSHIPS HAVE BEEN BROKEN

01:58:00.907 --> 01:58:04.043
AND WHAT DOES THE COMMUNITY

01:58:04.110 --> 01:58:06.312
AGREE COULD BE DONE TO HEAL. IT

01:58:06.379 --> 01:58:08.214
IS THOROUGHLY INCLUSIVE

01:58:08.281 --> 01:58:10.550
COMMUNITY DRIVEN AND GRASSROOTS

01:58:10.616 --> 01:58:13.653
IN ITS ORIENTATION. FOR EXAMPLE

01:58:13.719 --> 01:58:16.322
LET'S IMAGINE A SITUATION OF

THINGS DEVALUED HOW ARE LISTS.

01:58:43.516 --> 01:58:46.219

01:58:46.285 --> 01:58:49.222
HATRED RESENTMENT VENGEANCE

01:58:49.288 --> 01:58:52.825
RETRIBUTION RACIALLY TARGETED

01:58:52.892 --> 01:58:55.795
IN BETRAYED. AND THE POLICE

01:58:55.862 --> 01:58:57.797
OFFICER MIGHT FEEL ANGER.

01:58:57.864 --> 01:59:02.268
RESENTMENT FEAR SHE AND SELF

01:59:02.335 --> 01:59:05.137
RIGHTEOUSNESS. RESTORATIVE

01:59:05.204 --> 01:59:06.906
JUSTICE WOULD HAVE AN ENTIRELY

01:59:06.973 --> 01:59:08.674
DIFFERENT APPROACH TO RESOLVING

01:59:08.741 --> 01:59:11.310
THIS CONFLICT THEN I CURRENT

ATTEMPTING REPAIR RESTORATIVE

01:59:17.049 --> 01:59:19.619
JUSTICE WOULD SINCERELY EXPLORE

01:59:19.685 --> 01:59:22.054
HOW WE FIRST IDENTIFY THE

01:59:22.121 --> 01:59:24.123
VICTIMS AND THE COMMUNITIES

01:59:24.190 --> 01:59:26.492
THAT HAVE BEEN HARMED. HEY WE

01:59:26.559 --> 01:59:27.827
WOULD CONSIDER BOTH THE

01:59:27.894 --> 01:59:29.996
INDIVIDUALS MOST IMPACTED BY

01:59:30.062 --> 01:59:32.565

IMPACTED BY THE HARM AND THAT'S

01:59:46.879 --> 01:59:48.781
CAUSING. SO THIS WOULD INVOLVE

BRINGING TOGETHER THE POLICE

01:59:50.283 --> 01:59:52.885

WERE BROKEN AS A RESULT OF THE

02:00:19.545 --> 02:00:21.514
HARMFUL ACTION AND THEY WOULD

02:00:21.581 --> 02:00:23.683
WORK TOGETHER TO DETERMINE BY

02:00:23.749 --> 02:00:26.919
CONSENSUS WHAT WAS NEEDED TO

HELP THE HARM. THE OFFENDER

02:00:29.188 --> 02:00:30.590
POLICE OFFICER WOULD TAKE

02:00:30.656 --> 02:00:32.658
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE HARM

02:00:32.725 --> 02:00:35.261

SOLUTION FOCUSED PROCESS IT CAN

02:01:04.090 --> 02:01:05.691
BE REALLY LIFE CHANGING FOR ALL

WHO CAUSED THE HARM AND FOR

02:01:10.863 --> 02:01:12.832
THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN HARMED AS

02:01:12.898 --> 02:01:16.235

CAUSED AND FELT BY EACH OTHER.

02:01:48.200 --> 02:01:50.236
IT ALSO CREATES AN OPENING FOR

02:01:50.302 --> 02:01:51.937
EXPRESSIONS OF REMORSE

02:01:52.004 --> 02:01:56.208

BECAUSE THE POLICING SYSTEM IS

02:10:40.566 --> 02:10:42.100
OPERA OPERATING PROCEDURE WE

02:10:42.167 --> 02:10:44.436
JUST LEASE AND THAT IS. GIVING

02:10:44.503 --> 02:10:45.604
A VOICE TO THE COMMUNITY SO

02:10:45.671 --> 02:10:48.006
PART OF THAT IS LISTENING TO

02:10:48.073 --> 02:10:49.274
THE COMMUNITY'S CONCERNS AND

02:10:49.341 --> 02:10:52.211
BEING RESPONSIVE. AND LISTENING

02:10:52.277 --> 02:10:53.579
ACTIVELY ABOUT WHAT THE

02:10:53.645 --> 02:10:54.746
COMMUNITY BELIEVES NEED THAT

02:10:54.813 --> 02:10:56.548
NEEDS TO HAPPEN WILL IMPORT TO

02:10:56.615 --> 02:10:57.683
PREVENT SOMETHING LIKE THAT

02:10:57.749 --> 02:10:58.917
FROM OCCURRING. NOW THE STATE

02:10:58.984 --> 02:11:02.054
OF CALIFORNIA UNLESS SOMETHING

02:11:02.120 --> 02:11:04.223
BECOMES. PUBLIC FODDER FOR

02:11:04.289 --> 02:11:06.191
EXAMPLE IF IT MAKES IT INTO THE

02:11:06.258 --> 02:11:08.627
PUBLIC DOMAIN. INFORMATION

02:11:08.694 --> 02:11:10.162
CANNOT BE RELEASED ON

02:11:10.229 --> 02:11:11.196
INVESTIGATIONS WITHIN THE

02:11:11.263 --> 02:11:12.164
POLICE DEPARTMENT THAT'S

02:11:12.231 --> 02:11:13.966
SOMETHING WE HOPE TO CHANGE

02:11:14.032 --> 02:11:15.767
MOVING FORWARD BECAUSE AGAIN

02:11:15.834 --> 02:11:18.170
THAT. FROM MY PERSPECTIVE. SORT

02:11:18.237 --> 02:11:21.506
OF INHIBITS OUR ABILITY. TO

02:11:21.573 --> 02:11:22.874
SHOW THAT WE ARE HOLDING PEOPLE

02:11:22.941 --> 02:11:24.977
ACCOUNTABLE AND TO BUILD TRUST.

02:11:25.043 --> 02:11:26.445
SO RIGHT NOW UNLESS IT'S IN THE

02:11:26.511 --> 02:11:28.080
YEAR THE ONLY THING WE CAN DO

02:11:28.146 --> 02:11:29.881
IS COMMUNICATE WITH THE PERSON

02:11:29.948 --> 02:11:31.350
WHO LIVES THE COMPLAINT TO GIVE

02:11:31.416 --> 02:11:32.284
THEM THE RESULTS OF THE

02:11:32.351 --> 02:11:33.485
COMPLAINT. WELL LET'S SAY

02:11:33.552 --> 02:11:35.354
SOMETHING DID GO PUBLIC I THINK

02:11:35.420 --> 02:11:37.489
IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE AGENCY

02:11:37.556 --> 02:11:38.991
TO BE IN A COMMUNITY TALKING

02:11:39.057 --> 02:11:40.726
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED BEING

02:11:40.792 --> 02:11:42.561
HONEST AND FORTHRIGHT AND IF WE

02:11:42.628 --> 02:11:44.396
MAKE MISTAKES. LET'S OWN UP TO

02:11:44.463 --> 02:11:46.098
WHAT I KNOW I HEARD THAT THE

02:11:46.164 --> 02:11:48.233
DOCTOR MENTIONED THE CONCERNED

02:11:48.300 --> 02:11:50.035
ABOUT LAWSUITS AND THERE ARE.

02:11:50.102 --> 02:11:51.570
PEOPLE WHO ARE CONCERNED WITH

02:11:51.637 --> 02:11:53.372
THAT BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY

02:11:53.438 --> 02:11:54.172
WHAT'S MOST IMPORTANT IS

02:11:54.239 --> 02:11:55.974
BUILDING TRUST. AND NOT

02:11:56.041 --> 02:11:57.442
NECESSARILY SAVING A COUPLE OF

02:11:57.509 --> 02:11:59.111
DOLLARS ON THE BACK IN. THE

02:11:59.177 --> 02:12:00.879
COMMUNITIES CONSTRUCTIVE SO I

02:12:00.946 --> 02:12:02.381
BELIEVE THE MOST IMPORTANT

02:12:02.447 --> 02:12:04.583
THING IS TO BE TRANSPARENT. AND

02:12:04.650 --> 02:12:06.485
TO BE ACCOUNTABLE AND TO LISTEN

02:12:06.551 --> 02:12:07.686
ACTIVELY TO WHAT THE COMMUNITY

02:12:07.753 --> 02:12:10.589
IS SAYING AND RESPOND TO THOSE

02:12:10.656 --> 02:12:13.125
REQUESTS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH

02:12:13.191 --> 02:12:15.227
CHIEF OF FOR RESPONDING TO THAT

02:12:15.294 --> 02:12:17.763
QUESTION. WANT TO GO TO MISS-

02:12:17.829 --> 02:12:20.799
BANQUETTE- WITH RESPECT TO WHAT

02:12:20.866 --> 02:12:21.700
DO YOU THINK THAT THE

02:12:21.767 --> 02:12:24.236
LEGISLATURE SHOULD BE DOING- TO

02:12:24.303 --> 02:12:25.904
TRY TO ADDRESS THIS WHOLE

02:12:25.971 --> 02:12:28.273
RESTORATIVE JUSTICE KIND OF. OF

02:12:28.340 --> 02:12:31.376
SPACE. CAN YOU NAME A THREE

02:12:31.443 --> 02:12:33.178
POINTS THAT YOU LIKE TO. SHARE

02:12:33.245 --> 02:12:35.147
WITH US. THAT YOU THINK THROUGH

02:12:35.213 --> 02:12:37.182
YOUR WORK OBJECT IT WILL BE

02:12:37.249 --> 02:12:39.084
VERY USEFUL FOR US TO CONSIDER.

02:12:39.151 --> 02:12:40.552
AS WE DO THIS WORK IN TERMS OF

02:12:40.619 --> 02:12:44.323
REFORMING A REIMAGINE WHAT LAW

02:12:44.389 --> 02:12:44.923
ENFORCEMENT EXPECTING IN THIS

02:12:44.990 --> 02:12:47.225
STATE. YES THANK YOU FOR THAT

02:12:47.292 --> 02:12:51.730
QUESTION- THE BIG QUESTION I

02:12:51.797 --> 02:12:54.299
WOULD SAY NUMBER ONE AND A

02:12:54.366 --> 02:12:56.868
FOCUS ON RESTORATIVE POLICING

02:12:56.935 --> 02:12:58.103
THERE ARE SOME EXAMPLES

02:12:58.170 --> 02:13:00.405
WORLDWIDE IN THE CITY OF HULL

02:13:00.472 --> 02:13:02.474
ENGLAND FOR EXAMPLE IT'S A

02:13:02.541 --> 02:13:04.009
RESTORATIVE CITY IT USES

02:13:04.076 --> 02:13:06.178
RESTORATIVE APPROACHES IN

02:13:06.244 --> 02:13:09.314
POLICING SO NOT. IS TO INFUSE

02:13:09.381 --> 02:13:10.716
THESE PRACTICES AND PRINCIPLES

02:13:10.782 --> 02:13:12.617
BUT TO REALLY MAKE ORGANIZED

02:13:12.684 --> 02:13:14.653
THE SYSTEMS THEMSELVES- TO

02:13:14.720 --> 02:13:16.788
FOCUS MORE ON RELATIONSHIPS AND

02:13:16.855 --> 02:13:18.990
DIALOGUE AND RESOLVING

02:13:19.057 --> 02:13:21.560
WRONGDOING NOT ONLY FOCUSED ON

02:13:21.626 --> 02:13:23.628
CRIME SO THERE'S A THERE'S A

02:13:23.695 --> 02:13:25.897
COMPLETE KIND OF RE ORIENTATION

02:13:25.964 --> 02:13:28.033
IN POLICING AND I WOULD ARGUE

02:13:28.100 --> 02:13:29.768
FOR- AND I THINK MOST

02:13:29.835 --> 02:13:30.635
RESTORATIVE JUSTICE

02:13:30.702 --> 02:13:32.871
PRACTITIONERS WOULD TOO SO

02:13:32.938 --> 02:13:34.072
THAT'S A BIG THING WHICH DEALS

02:13:34.139 --> 02:13:36.041
WITH- THAT KIND OF%

02:13:36.108 --> 02:13:37.175
INFRASTRUCTURE WITHIN OUR

02:13:37.242 --> 02:13:39.144
POLICE SEEMED KIND OF SYSTEMS

02:13:39.211 --> 02:13:41.279
THEMSELVES. YES AND THAT'S ONE

02:13:41.346 --> 02:13:44.349
AND IT'S A NUMBER TWO- WOULD BE

02:13:44.416 --> 02:13:46.551
TO SINCE TWO I AGREE WITH

02:13:46.618 --> 02:13:47.953
WHAT'S BEEN SAID ABOUT TRAINING

02:13:48.019 --> 02:13:49.755
LIKE YOU CAN'T TRAIN RACISM OUT

02:13:49.821 --> 02:13:51.523
OF PEOPLE BUT IT'S IMPORTANT TO

02:13:51.590 --> 02:13:55.427
GIVE- POLICE OFFICER IS A KIND

02:13:55.494 --> 02:13:57.229
OF AN ORIENTATION THAT SPEAKS

02:13:57.295 --> 02:13:59.297
TO THE HEART OF THAT IMPLICIT

02:13:59.364 --> 02:14:02.100
BIAS DOESN'T HAPPEN SO THAT IT

02:14:02.167 --> 02:14:04.503
IS ELIMINATED IN A DEEP WAY AND

02:14:04.569 --> 02:14:05.971
SO FOR THAT TO HAPPEN YOU CAN'T

02:14:06.037 --> 02:14:07.372
JUST TEACH PEOPLE AND TRY TO

02:14:07.439 --> 02:14:08.874
SPEAK TO THE HEAD AND TRY TO

02:14:08.940 --> 02:14:11.710
INTELLECTUALLY. GET THEM TO NOT

02:14:11.777 --> 02:14:13.545
WE HAVE A REFLEX THAT IS NOT

02:14:13.612 --> 02:14:15.814
LARGELY UNCONSCIOUS IN IN A

02:14:15.881 --> 02:14:18.450
MOMENT WHERE HARM OCCURS SO

02:14:18.517 --> 02:14:20.485
IT'S MORE THAN JUST TRADING IT

02:14:20.552 --> 02:14:23.422
IS. AN EXPERIENCE REALLY THAT

02:14:23.488 --> 02:14:26.758
IS RESTRUCTURING A LIFETIME OF

02:14:26.825 --> 02:14:27.692
YOU KNOW TAKING AND A WHITE

02:14:27.759 --> 02:14:29.428
SUPREMACIST KIND OF A CULTURE

02:14:29.494 --> 02:14:31.296
AND ENVIRONMENT SO JUST BEING

02:14:31.363 --> 02:14:37.369
REALLY. SERIOUS AND SINCERE

02:14:37.436 --> 02:14:38.970
ABOUT. I DON'T WANT THE TREE

02:14:39.037 --> 02:14:42.841
BUT UP ABOUT RE. THE OF THE

02:14:42.908 --> 02:14:44.976
CALL- POLICING BASICALLY BOTH

02:14:45.043 --> 02:14:46.545
HOW POLICE UP. ENGAGE THOSE

02:14:46.611 --> 02:14:48.880
ACTIVITIES HOW THIS HOW THE

02:14:48.947 --> 02:14:54.286
THAT IT POLICE INSTITUTIONS-

02:14:54.352 --> 02:14:57.055
OUR BRAVE. MEN IT'S- AN ORGAN

02:14:57.122 --> 02:14:58.390
AND THEN WHAT THEIR

02:14:58.457 --> 02:15:02.961
EXPECTATIONS ARE OF THEM. YES I

02:15:03.028 --> 02:15:05.597
RACES- YOU KNOW KIND OF EITHER

02:15:05.664 --> 02:15:08.033
AND APPROACH SO I WOULD SAY

02:15:08.099 --> 02:15:08.600
THOSE TWO THINGS IN THE LAST

02:15:08.667 --> 02:15:11.169
JUST OPENING UP THE WAYS IN

02:15:11.236 --> 02:15:15.707
WHICH- IS OFTEN. THIRD AND A

02:15:15.774 --> 02:15:17.175
COMMUNITY CAN'T INTERACT SO

02:15:17.242 --> 02:15:20.178
CREATING OPPORTUNITIES FOR THIS

02:15:20.245 --> 02:15:23.181
NEW DEEP INTO HEALING SO YES

02:15:23.248 --> 02:15:25.116
PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN HARM TO

02:15:25.183 --> 02:15:26.685
COMMUNITIES HAVE BEEN HARMED

02:15:26.751 --> 02:15:29.020
THAT HAVE BEEN HARMED WANT-

02:15:29.087 --> 02:15:30.288
ACCOUNTABILITY AND WHAT'S THAT

02:15:30.355 --> 02:15:31.723
ACCOUNTABILITY LOOKS LIKE IS

02:15:31.790 --> 02:15:32.691
DIFFERENT THAN WHAT AN

02:15:32.757 --> 02:15:35.927
OVERSIGHT BOARD. ART I TELL YOU

02:15:35.994 --> 02:15:37.963
WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO

02:15:38.029 --> 02:15:40.332
INDIVIDUALS TO OUR ARMED AND

02:15:40.398 --> 02:15:43.768
COMMUNITIES. AND KIND OF. IN

02:15:43.835 --> 02:15:45.470

AND THE- AND THE COMMUNITY

02:15:48.273 --> 02:15:53.979
NETWORK DINNER ALSO. CONSENT

02:15:54.045 --> 02:15:58.083
EXISTENCE IS DONE THE- FOR THAT.

02:15:58.149 --> 02:15:59.551
BUT TO KIND OF GO OVER THE

02:15:59.618 --> 02:16:01.453
OUTSIDE THIS IS BUT THAT'S HOW

02:16:01.520 --> 02:16:02.754
TO COMPLETE ACT HAPPY SO MANY

02:16:02.821 --> 02:16:03.955
OF THESE OTHER RESPONSE ARE YOU

02:16:04.022 --> 02:16:06.358
KNOW BAND ON A GUNSHOT WOUND

02:16:06.424 --> 02:16:08.860
AND THAT THE PAIN GETS CARRIED

02:16:08.927 --> 02:16:11.329
BY OF THE COMMUNITY AND THE

02:16:11.396 --> 02:16:13.532
POLICE OFFICER AND THE POLICE

02:16:13.598 --> 02:16:15.567
INSTITUTION TO JUST CREATE

02:16:15.634 --> 02:16:16.935
BIGGER BARRIERS AND MORE

02:16:17.002 --> 02:16:20.205
DIVISIONS SO- I WOULD JUST SAY

HAVING ANOTHER OPERATOR HAVING

02:16:22.240 --> 02:16:24.309
MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR DEEP

02:16:24.376 --> 02:16:26.144
RESTORATIVE RELATIONSHIPS

02:16:26.211 --> 02:16:28.580
BETWEEN POLICE POLICE OFFICERS

02:16:28.647 --> 02:16:31.016

DOING THAT WE'RE NOT DOING BY

02:16:51.436 --> 02:16:53.872
WAY OF POLICY. TO TRY TO

BRIDGE THE GAP- ADDRESS ISSUES

02:17:14.426 --> 02:17:16.828
THAT ARE NOT BEING ADDRESSED-

02:17:16.895 --> 02:17:19.164
SO THAT THE COMMUNITY AND LAW

02:17:19.230 --> 02:17:20.932

COMMUNITY HE'S- IT IS JUST A

02:17:46.992 --> 02:17:49.294
SYMPTOM OF WHAT IS OCCURRING IT

02:17:49.361 --> 02:17:50.795
IN EVERY SITUATION IN OUR

02:17:50.862 --> 02:17:53.598
COUNTRY. RIGHT WE ARE THE FACE

02:17:53.665 --> 02:17:55.834
OF GOVERNMENT AND SO THE THINGS

02:17:55.900 --> 02:17:57.669
THAT CAN MOST GO WRONG

02:17:57.736 --> 02:17:59.304
TYPICALLY HAPPEN WHEN THOSE

02:17:59.371 --> 02:18:00.672
INTERACTIONS TAKE PLACE BECAUSE

02:18:00.739 --> 02:18:02.173
WE'RE ON THE COMMUNITIES BUT

02:18:02.240 --> 02:18:04.175
EVERY SYSTEM. IN THE UNITED

NINETEEN SIXTIES AND SOME OF

02:18:10.682 --> 02:18:11.282
THE SAME THINGS THAT WERE

02:18:11.349 --> 02:18:12.617
MENTIONED IN THAT REPORT. EXIST

02:18:12.684 --> 02:18:16.054
TODAY. BUT IF YOU WERE TO ASK.

02:18:16.121 --> 02:18:17.288
AND YOU DID WHAT THE

02:18:17.355 --> 02:18:18.723
LEGISLATURE COULD DO I THINK

02:18:18.790 --> 02:18:19.290
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THE

02:18:19.357 --> 02:18:21.359
LEGISLATURE IS DOING IS. TRYING

02:18:21.426 --> 02:18:23.628
TO MAKE SURE THAT. DEPARTMENTS

02:18:23.695 --> 02:18:25.497
ARE MORE TRANSPARENT. BUT I

02:18:25.563 --> 02:18:26.665
THINK REALLY THE MILLION DOLLAR

02:18:26.731 --> 02:18:27.966
QUESTION AND I'VE SAID THIS TO

02:18:28.033 --> 02:18:29.768
SOMEONE COLLEAGUES. IS HOW DO

02:18:29.834 --> 02:18:31.670
YOU HOLD CHIEF. CHIEF OF POLICE

02:18:31.736 --> 02:18:33.705
ACCOUNTABLE. BECAUSE THAT'S TO

02:18:33.772 --> 02:18:35.440
CHANGE THE CULTURE. AT THE END

02:18:35.507 --> 02:18:37.075
OF THE DAY. YOU CAN HAVE

02:18:37.142 --> 02:18:39.210
POLICIES YOU CAN HAVE. LAWS ON

02:18:39.277 --> 02:18:40.545
THE BOOKS YOU CAN HAVE TRAINING

02:18:40.612 --> 02:18:42.514
BUT ULTIMATELY THE CHIEF.

02:18:42.580 --> 02:18:44.716
CHANGES THE CULTURE SO HOW DO

02:18:44.783 --> 02:18:45.316
YOU HOLD YOUR CHIEFS OF POLICE

02:18:45.383 --> 02:18:47.585
ACCOUNTABLE. THAT IS WHAT I'M

02:18:47.652 --> 02:18:48.453
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT BECAUSE

02:18:48.520 --> 02:18:49.521
THAT'S WHAT I THINK NEEDS TO BE

02:18:49.587 --> 02:18:51.690
DONE IF YOU TRULY WANT SYSTEMIC

02:18:51.756 --> 02:18:53.758
CHANGE AT. ALL LEVELS. IN

02:18:53.825 --> 02:18:54.726
ADDITION TO SOME OF THE THINGS

02:18:54.793 --> 02:18:56.227
HAVE BEEN DISCUSSED BECAUSE I

02:18:56.294 --> 02:18:57.395
THINK THERE IS VALUE WILL BRING

02:18:57.462 --> 02:18:58.296
THINGS TO PEOPLE'S ATTENTION

02:18:58.363 --> 02:19:00.265
GIVEN THEM AN OPPORTUNITY. TO

02:19:00.331 --> 02:19:03.468
RECOGNIZE. SOME OF THE BLIND

02:19:03.535 --> 02:19:06.571
SPOTS. AND THEN. CREATE

02:19:06.638 --> 02:19:07.472
INTERVENTION SO THAT THEY DON'T

02:19:07.539 --> 02:19:08.907
HAVE AS MANY. AND THEY DON'T

02:19:08.973 --> 02:19:10.308
IMPACT THE WAY THEY TREAT

02:19:10.375 --> 02:19:11.176
PEOPLE BUT AT THE END OF THE

02:19:11.242 --> 02:19:14.179
DAY THE CHIEF. OF POLICE CHANGE

02:19:14.245 --> 02:19:14.779
THE CULTURE IN AN ORGANIZATION

02:19:14.846 --> 02:19:17.749
WHICH- INFORMED HOW OFFICERS

02:19:17.816 --> 02:19:19.617
TREAT PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY.

02:19:19.684 --> 02:19:21.619
AND HOW DO WE DO THAT THAT'S

02:19:21.686 --> 02:19:24.989
THE QUESTION. THANK YOU ALSO

02:19:25.056 --> 02:19:27.092
FOLLOW QUESTION I'VE HEARD AND

02:19:27.158 --> 02:19:29.260
I DARE NOT MENTION NAMES BUT

02:19:29.327 --> 02:19:31.262
I'VE HEARD FROM POLICE CHIEFS

02:19:31.329 --> 02:19:33.965
THAT THEIR HANDS ARE ARE ALMOST

02:19:34.032 --> 02:19:36.968
TAG IN TERMS OF DEALING WITH A

02:19:37.035 --> 02:19:39.070
BAD APPLE THAT MAY EXIST IN A

02:19:39.137 --> 02:19:44.242
DEPARTMENT- DO YOU SHARE- THAT

02:19:44.309 --> 02:19:47.312
SAME FEELING AND OR IF THERE'S

02:19:47.378 --> 02:19:49.614
ANY SUGGESTIONS YOU CAN GIVE.

02:19:49.681 --> 02:19:52.283
US THAT WE MAY BE ABLE TO

02:19:52.350 --> 02:19:55.587
ADDRESS THAT FROM A POLICY

02:19:55.653 --> 02:19:58.423
STANDPOINT MOVING FORWARD. VERY

02:19:58.490 --> 02:20:00.558
GOOD QUESTIONS ALSO THIS I'VE

02:20:00.625 --> 02:20:01.159
GOT THE UNIQUE EXPERIENCE OF

02:20:01.226 --> 02:20:02.427
HAVING WORKED IN ANOTHER STATE

02:20:02.494 --> 02:20:03.928
THAT HAVE HAD- HAVING COME TO

02:20:03.995 --> 02:20:06.131
CALIFORNIA. AND I'VE BEEN AN

02:20:06.197 --> 02:20:08.266
EXECUTIVE FOR. ONE THIRD OF MY

02:20:08.333 --> 02:20:09.534
CAREER SO ABOUT TWELVE YEARS

02:20:09.601 --> 02:20:11.069
I'VE BEEN AT EITHER NUMBER TWO

02:20:11.136 --> 02:20:13.638
IN A LARGE AGENCY. AND HERE IS

02:20:13.705 --> 02:20:15.273
THE CHIEF. AND A SMALLER AGENCY.

02:20:15.340 --> 02:20:17.842
MY HANDS ARE TIED NOW I CAN

02:20:17.909 --> 02:20:18.943
UNDERSTAND FROM THE STANDPOINT

02:20:19.010 --> 02:20:20.845
THEY FEEL IF SOMETHING GOES TO

02:20:20.912 --> 02:20:22.080
ARBITRATION AND THE DECISION

02:20:22.147 --> 02:20:23.581
THEY'VE MADE MAYBE GETS

02:20:23.648 --> 02:20:24.816
OVERTURNED AND ARE IN

02:20:24.883 --> 02:20:26.151
ARBITRATION THAT'S A SEPARATE

02:20:26.217 --> 02:20:27.519
ISSUE I CAN UNDERSTAND THAT CAN

02:20:27.585 --> 02:20:30.121
BE FRUSTRATING. AND I SEE THAT

02:20:30.188 --> 02:20:31.523
AS AN IMPEDIMENT BUT AT THE

02:20:31.589 --> 02:20:33.458
SAME TIME OFFICERS WANT TO MAKE

02:20:33.525 --> 02:20:35.760
SURE THAT THEY'VE GOT AN

02:20:35.827 --> 02:20:37.996
AVENUE. TO ADDRESS. ISSUES THAT

02:20:38.062 --> 02:20:39.230
THEY FEEL MAYBE THEY WEREN'T

02:20:39.297 --> 02:20:41.766
BEING TREATED FAIRLY IN. BUT MY

02:20:41.833 --> 02:20:42.967
HANDS ARE TIED IF I WANT TO

02:20:43.034 --> 02:20:44.736
TAKE A PARTICULAR ACTION

02:20:44.803 --> 02:20:46.271
BECAUSE I BELIEVE VIOLATES

02:20:46.337 --> 02:20:48.139
POLICY OR BELIEVE IT VIOLATES.

02:20:48.206 --> 02:20:49.374
THE PHILOSOPHICAL APPROACH AND

02:20:49.440 --> 02:20:51.075
I THINK OUR OFFICERS SHOULD BE

02:20:51.142 --> 02:20:52.410
EMBODYING. I CAN HOLD PEOPLE

02:20:52.477 --> 02:20:55.847
ACCOUNTABLE MY HANDS ARE TIED.

02:20:55.914 --> 02:20:56.915
NOW I NEED TO MAKE SURE I HAVE

02:20:56.981 --> 02:20:58.016
A STRONG ENOUGH CASE SO THAT

02:20:58.082 --> 02:20:58.716
THE LIKELIHOOD OF GETTING

02:20:58.783 --> 02:21:00.251
OVERTURNED IS REDUCED BUT THE

02:21:00.318 --> 02:21:01.519
FACT IS NONE OF US HAVE A

02:21:01.586 --> 02:21:02.554
CRYSTAL BALL AND YOU CAN HAVE

02:21:02.620 --> 02:21:04.088
THE STRONGEST CASE IN THE WORLD

02:21:04.155 --> 02:21:05.657
AND I CAN STLL GET OVER HER.

02:21:05.723 --> 02:21:07.358
MY HANDS ARE TIED SO I WOULD BE

02:21:07.425 --> 02:21:09.060
CURIOUS TO KNOW WHAT THOSE

02:21:09.127 --> 02:21:11.296
EXAMPLES ARE BECAUSE MY HANDS

02:21:11.362 --> 02:21:13.498
WERE TIED WHEN I WAS IN TEXAS

02:21:13.565 --> 02:21:15.767
NOT. TIED HERE. THANK YOU VERY

02:21:15.834 --> 02:21:18.803
MUCH FOR THAT. I WANT TO GO TO-

02:21:18.870 --> 02:21:21.706
MISS YOU- IF YOU'RE STILL WITH

02:21:21.773 --> 02:21:24.409
US. AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH TO

02:21:24.475 --> 02:21:25.476
WE MAY HAVE ANOTHER QUESTION I

02:21:25.543 --> 02:21:28.213
DON'T KNOW BUT PLEASE STAND BY

02:21:28.279 --> 02:21:30.048
I MISS YOU I HAVE A QUESTION

02:21:30.114 --> 02:21:32.350
FOR YOU- WHAT DO YOU THINK THE

02:21:32.417 --> 02:21:33.618
LEGISLATURE SHOULD BE FOCUSED

02:21:33.685 --> 02:21:35.086
ON AS IT RELATES TO RE

02:21:35.153 --> 02:21:37.121
IMAGINING AND I USE THE WORD-

02:21:37.188 --> 02:21:38.923
REIMAGINE ALSO REFORM

02:21:38.990 --> 02:21:40.825
INTERCHANGEABLY BUT WE'RE GOING

02:21:40.892 --> 02:21:41.860
TO REIMAGINE WHAT LAW

02:21:41.926 --> 02:21:42.894
ENFORCEMENT LOOKS LIKE IN THE

02:21:42.961 --> 02:21:44.295
STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SO WITH

02:21:44.362 --> 02:21:47.065
THAT BEING SAID WHAT ARE SOME

02:21:47.131 --> 02:21:49.734
OF WHAT CAN YOU GIVE ME THREE-

02:21:49.801 --> 02:21:50.969
PARTICULAR AREAS THAT THE

02:21:51.035 --> 02:21:52.537
LEGISLATURE SHOULD BE FOCUSING

02:21:52.604 --> 02:21:55.240
ON TO TRY TO HELP AND REIMAGINE

02:21:55.306 --> 02:21:58.910
WHAT LAW ENFORCEMENT LOOKS LIKE

02:21:58.977 --> 02:21:59.978
IN THIS STATE. FROM YOUR LANDS.

02:22:00.044 --> 02:22:02.247
SURE SO THERE HAS BEEN A THEME

02:22:02.313 --> 02:22:03.815
HERE TODAY IT'S REALLY ABOUT

02:22:03.882 --> 02:22:04.949
TRANSPARENCY AND

02:22:05.016 --> 02:22:06.784
ACCOUNTABILITY. WHEN YOU'RE

02:22:06.851 --> 02:22:08.353
LOOKING AT THESE REFORMS YOU

02:22:08.419 --> 02:22:11.322
HAVE A COUPLE OF ISSUES. ONE I

02:22:11.389 --> 02:22:14.158
EASE IN SB TWO ONE TWO IN

02:22:14.225 --> 02:22:15.793
FRONT. OF ONE OF THE WITH

02:22:15.860 --> 02:22:18.263
ISSUES. IT HOW DO YOU DEAL WITH

02:22:18.329 --> 02:22:21.432
DECERTIFICATION WE ARE NOW ONLY

02:22:21.499 --> 02:22:23.167
ONE OF FOUR STATES THAT DO NOT

02:22:23.234 --> 02:22:25.403
HAVE A PROCESS. IN DEALING WITH

02:22:25.470 --> 02:22:26.704
POLICE OFFICERS WHO BREAK THE

02:22:26.771 --> 02:22:28.439
LAW. SO IT REALLY IS

02:22:28.506 --> 02:22:30.541
UNACCEPTABLE BUT ALL THESE

02:22:30.608 --> 02:22:33.311
OTHER STATES HAVE A WAY TO DEAL

02:22:33.378 --> 02:22:34.479
WITH THEIR OFFICERS AND TREAT

02:22:34.545 --> 02:22:36.247
THEM AS PROFESSIONALS THAT THEY

02:22:36.314 --> 02:22:38.349
ARE. BUT WE DO NOT SO THAT

02:22:38.416 --> 02:22:41.219
REALLY IS ONE WAY TO MAKE. IT

02:22:41.286 --> 02:22:43.588
TRANSPARENT. AND YOU HAVE-

02:22:43.655 --> 02:22:46.090
ACCOUNTABILITY BY THE OFFICERS.

02:22:46.157 --> 02:22:47.992
THE SECOND ISSUE AS WE TALKED

02:22:48.059 --> 02:22:50.061
ABOUT ARE THESE IMMUNITIES THE

02:22:50.128 --> 02:22:52.964
WAY THAT WE TREAT THE VICTIMS.

02:22:53.031 --> 02:22:53.798
OF POLICE VIOLENCE SO

02:22:53.865 --> 02:22:55.566
DIFFERENTLY. THAN WE DO THE

02:22:55.633 --> 02:22:57.435
OFFICERS THEMSELVES. IS

02:22:57.502 --> 02:22:59.003
UNSPEAKABLE AND EXPAND THE

02:22:59.070 --> 02:23:02.106
CLEAR MESSAGE AGAIN AND AGAIN

02:23:02.173 --> 02:23:03.875
TO EVERYBODY WITHIN THE STATE.

02:23:03.942 --> 02:23:06.110
THAT SOME PEOPLE DESERVE TO BE

02:23:06.177 --> 02:23:07.912
TREATED BETTER SOME PEOPLE GET

02:23:07.979 --> 02:23:10.548
SPECIAL TREATMENT FROM THE

02:23:10.615 --> 02:23:13.151
JUDGES. OUT FROM THEIR OWN

02:23:13.217 --> 02:23:15.086
DEPARTMENTS FROM THE POPULAR.

02:23:15.153 --> 02:23:16.888
CHILDHOOD VICTIMS HAVE NOWHERE

02:23:16.955 --> 02:23:19.257
TO GO NO ONE TO TALK TO YOU. I

02:23:19.324 --> 02:23:20.191
SO I THINK IT'S REALLY

02:23:20.258 --> 02:23:22.193
CRITICALLY IMPORTANT THAT IN

02:23:22.260 --> 02:23:24.696
LOOKING AT SB TOOTH THAT BOTH

02:23:24.762 --> 02:23:26.731
PROVISIONS. AND ARE LOOKED AT

02:23:26.798 --> 02:23:28.833
VERY CAREFULLY BECAUSE THEY

02:23:28.900 --> 02:23:31.035
BELIEVE THE REPRESENT WIDE

02:23:31.102 --> 02:23:37.608
ACCOUNTABILITY AND.

02:23:37.675 --> 02:23:39.911
TRANSPARENCY CAN LEAD TO. THANK

MUCH FOR THAT HI I HEAR YOU

KNOW A COMMON THEME IN TERMS OF

02:23:49.754 --> 02:23:50.922
A TRANSPARENCY AND I THINK

02:23:50.989 --> 02:23:53.791
THAT. WHAT I'VE HEARD FROM BOTH

02:23:53.858 --> 02:23:55.126
SIDES PEOPLE WANT TO BE

02:23:55.193 --> 02:23:57.528
TRANSPARENT IN THIS PARTICULAR

02:23:57.595 --> 02:23:59.897
PROCESS AND SO WE CERTAINLY

02:23:59.964 --> 02:24:02.300

THAT WE ARE LOOKING AT AND

02:24:04.469 --> 02:24:06.104

THE CAPITOL BUILDING. AND WE

02:30:40.064 --> 02:30:41.932
NOTICED THERE WAS A PARADE OF

02:30:41.999 --> 02:30:43.634
ANTIFA MARCHERS THAT WERE

02:30:43.701 --> 02:30:46.103
MARCHING DOWN IN ST AND WE HAD

02:30:46.170 --> 02:30:48.038
PARKED OUR VEHICLE IN IN ST

TEARING OFF- SIDE MIRRORS AND

02:30:59.250 --> 02:31:01.752
SLASHING TIRES AND AS THEY

02:31:01.819 --> 02:31:03.754
STARTED TO APPROACH THE POLICE

02:31:03.821 --> 02:31:05.322
WORK MAINTAINING QUITE A

02:31:05.389 --> 02:31:07.091
DISTANCE FROM THESE MARCHERS

02:31:07.158 --> 02:31:09.760
AND THEY TOLD US THAT WE SHOULD

02:31:09.827 --> 02:31:11.896
NOT PASS BY THE POLICE

02:31:11.962 --> 02:31:13.197

02:31:13.264 --> 02:31:15.499
OUR SAFETY. AND I SAID WHAT

02:31:15.566 --> 02:31:17.201

WE SEE IT WE CAN ARREST THEM

02:31:21.872 --> 02:31:23.841
BUT THEY WERE BASICALLY WAITING

02:31:23.908 --> 02:31:25.743
A WHOLE BLOCK BEHIND THE

02:31:25.810 --> 02:31:27.278

FOR THEM TO SEE- ANY KIND OF

02:31:30.047 --> 02:31:32.183
VANDALISM AGAINST VEHICLES. AND

02:31:32.249 --> 02:31:34.118
IT BOTHERED ME THAT. I FELT

02:31:34.185 --> 02:31:35.886

02:31:55.973 --> 02:31:56.407
RIGHT NEXT TO THE POLICE

02:31:56.474 --> 02:31:58.476

LOOKING AT THEIR DAMAGED

02:32:19.430 --> 02:32:21.131
VEHICLES AND- IT BOTHERED ME

02:32:21.198 --> 02:32:25.402
THAT. THAT THE POLICE OFFICERS

02:32:25.469 --> 02:32:27.972
WOULD ALLOW THAT TO HAPPEN- TWO

02:32:28.038 --> 02:32:28.572

THEY DO I CANNOT A MAN OF THE

02:32:58.035 --> 02:32:59.169
MATCH IN THE MENA STRESSED THAT

THANK YOU LET ME SPEAK TODAY-

02:35:08.465 --> 02:35:13.170
WHAT I LEARNED ABOUT AB SIX IS

02:35:13.237 --> 02:35:14.338
FIVE IS THAT I LEARNED THAT

02:35:14.405 --> 02:35:16.807
IT'S TO FIND POTENTIAL HATE

02:35:16.874 --> 02:35:19.143
GROUPS WITHIN LAW ENFORCEMENT

02:35:19.209 --> 02:35:20.811
AND I THINK THIS BILL. THE LIST

02:35:20.878 --> 02:35:22.646
WHERE I WRITE IS VERY SLIPPERY

02:35:22.713 --> 02:35:25.049
SLOPE BECAUSE YOU WANT TO. VOTE

02:35:25.115 --> 02:35:26.417
OUT THE HATE GROUP OF THOSE

02:35:26.483 --> 02:35:27.317
HAVE BEEN INVOLVED THE HATE

02:35:27.384 --> 02:35:28.285
GROUP BUT THE QUESTION COMES

02:35:28.352 --> 02:35:30.821
DOWN TO WHO WITH THE HATE GROUP

02:35:30.888 --> 02:35:32.923
IN WHAT IS A HATE GROUP. AND

02:35:32.990 --> 02:35:34.658
WHEN YOU LABEL THINGS SPECIAL

02:35:34.725 --> 02:35:36.560
LAW ENFORCEMENT HAS WEISS A PER

02:35:36.627 --> 02:35:38.562
ME SI OVER INTO VICE DIPLOMACY

02:35:38.629 --> 02:35:40.397
WORLD THINGS VERY DANGEROUS

02:35:40.464 --> 02:35:41.932
VISUAL LABEL AND EVERY SINGLE

02:35:41.999 --> 02:35:43.834
PERSON IN LAW ENFORCEMENT. A

02:35:43.901 --> 02:35:45.569
SUPREME IS BASED ON COLOR SKIN

02:35:45.636 --> 02:35:47.171
AND BY DEFINITION THAT WOULD BE

02:35:47.237 --> 02:35:49.673
RACES. SO I THINK THIS BILL IS

02:35:49.740 --> 02:35:51.075
A VERY SLIPPERY SLOPE BECAUSE

02:35:51.141 --> 02:35:52.676
IT TARGETS A CERTAIN PEOPLE

02:35:52.743 --> 02:35:54.178
EVEN THOUGH IT'S SAID TO BE

02:35:54.244 --> 02:35:55.779
CLAIM THAT IT'S NOT IT REALLY

02:35:55.846 --> 02:35:57.781
IS TARGETING A GROUP OF PEOPLE

02:35:57.848 --> 02:35:59.383
BECAUSE WHO BECOMES A HATE

02:35:59.450 --> 02:36:02.252
GROUP CHRISTIANS. PRO LIFERS

02:36:02.319 --> 02:36:03.954
ANYBODY THT HAS A RELIGION

02:36:04.021 --> 02:36:04.722
THAT GOES AGAINST THE

02:36:04.788 --> 02:36:06.590
NARRATIVE. WHO DO WE START

02:36:06.657 --> 02:36:08.659
DEMAND WHO'S I HATE GROUP AND

02:36:08.726 --> 02:36:12.896
WHO'S NOT. SO I THINK THIS IS A

02:36:12.963 --> 02:36:13.497
VERY SLIPPERY SLOPE I THINK.

02:36:13.564 --> 02:36:14.298
YOU SHOULD REALLY TINK ABOUT

02:36:14.364 --> 02:36:14.898

02:36:14.965 --> 02:36:17.234
BILL. COULD YOU CAN BE

02:36:17.301 --> 02:36:19.470
POTENTIALLY TARGETING PEOPLE.

02:36:19.536 --> 02:36:21.171

02:36:21.238 --> 02:36:25.142
