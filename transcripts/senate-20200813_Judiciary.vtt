CHARLES BILL AFFECTED CONTACT

TRACING IS CRITICAL TO

00:29:11.182 --> 00:29:12.617
SUCCESSFULLY BATTLING THIS

00:29:12.684 --> 00:29:15.253

THE UPPER HAND ON THIS PANDEMIC

00:29:33.671 --> 00:29:34.973
I THINK IT IS AS SIMPLE AS

00:29:35.039 --> 00:29:36.608
THAT. AND OF COURSE ONE OF THE

00:29:36.674 --> 00:29:38.209
PRIMARY FACTORS FOR WHETHER A

THEIR ASSOCIATIONS IF THEY KNOW

00:30:17.849 --> 00:30:19.250
THAT IT IS SLOWLY BEING USED TO

THE BILL'S A STRONG STEP

00:30:52.250 --> 00:30:53.851

CERTAINLY MAKING A SPLASH. I

00:31:35.593 --> 00:31:37.729
THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT- I

00:31:37.795 --> 00:31:40.598
THINK I WOULD LIKE TO

00:31:40.665 --> 00:31:43.034
RESPECTFULLY SUBMIT A- SLIGHTLY

00:31:43.101 --> 00:31:47.171
DIFFERENT POSITION I THINK- YOU

00:31:47.238 --> 00:31:49.073
QUOTED THAT PUBLIC HEALTH IS

00:31:49.140 --> 00:31:52.310
ABOUT TRUST. I WOULD SUBMIT TO

00:31:52.377 --> 00:31:55.313
MY COLLEAGUES INTO THE PUBLIC.

00:31:55.380 --> 00:31:57.081
THAT PUBLIC HEALTH IS ABOUT

00:31:57.148 --> 00:32:01.586
RESPONSIBILITY. AND I FIND IT

00:32:01.653 --> 00:32:03.488
VERY CHALLENGING TO

00:32:03.554 --> 00:32:07.091
SIMULTANEOUSLY. GET EVERYONE TO

00:32:07.158 --> 00:32:11.296
AGREE. THAT WE ARE IN A BONA

00:32:11.362 --> 00:32:14.632
FIDE EMERGENCY. NOT ONLY IN THE

00:32:14.699 --> 00:32:16.401
CITY CALIFORNIA IN OUR NATION

00:32:16.467 --> 00:32:19.504
BUT GLOBALLY. BUT THEN PUT

00:32:19.570 --> 00:32:22.807
FORWARD RULES THAT PRESCRIBE

00:32:22.874 --> 00:32:27.712
EXACTLY HOW WE ADAPT TO THE DOT

00:32:27.779 --> 00:32:29.447
THE DYNAMIC SITUATION OF THIS

00:32:29.514 --> 00:32:32.550
EMERGENCY. WHAT I DON'T

00:32:32.617 --> 00:32:36.254
UNDERSTAND ADDITIONALLY IS. WE

00:32:36.321 --> 00:32:40.224
HAVE AREAS OF THE STATE THEY DO

00:32:40.291 --> 00:32:42.593
NOT HAVE THE MEDICAL PERSONNEL.

00:32:42.660 --> 00:32:44.896
AND THE PERSON THE PERSONNEL

00:32:44.962 --> 00:32:47.732
CORPS. TO BE ABLE TO DO THE

00:32:47.799 --> 00:32:49.634
TYPE OF WORK THAT WE DEEM SO

00:32:49.701 --> 00:32:51.736
IMPORTANT IN UNDERSERVED AND

00:32:51.803 --> 00:32:53.404
CIRCUMSTANCES WOULD NEED TO

00:32:53.471 --> 00:32:56.941
INVOKE. INACTIVATE OTHER

00:32:57.008 --> 00:32:58.910
RESOURCES OF THE STATE

00:32:58.976 --> 00:33:01.979
SOMETIMES THAT COULD BE.

00:33:02.046 --> 00:33:05.049
INDIVIDUALS AND LAW ENFORCEMENT.

00:33:05.116 --> 00:33:07.352
SO I THINK I CAN BASED ON

00:33:07.418 --> 00:33:09.520
EARLIER PIECE OF LEGISLATION

00:33:09.587 --> 00:33:11.456
THAT HAVE COME THROUGH. I

00:33:11.522 --> 00:33:12.790
BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE ADEQUATE

00:33:12.857 --> 00:33:14.892
PROTECTIONS IN PLACE FOR THOSE

00:33:14.959 --> 00:33:15.993
INDIVIDUALS THAT WOULD NORMALLY

00:33:16.060 --> 00:33:19.063
BE CONCERNED ABOUT DISCLOSING

00:33:19.130 --> 00:33:21.165
INFORMATION TO LAW ENFORCEMENT.

00:33:21.232 --> 00:33:22.567
BECAUSE I THINK THERE WAS A

00:33:22.633 --> 00:33:25.370
RULE IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN WHAT

00:33:25.436 --> 00:33:29.374
WAS IT SB FIFTY FOUR. TWENTY

00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:31.142
TWENTY SEVENTEEN SB FIFTY FOUR

00:33:31.209 --> 00:33:33.111
DISALLOWED LAW ENFORCEMENT FROM

00:33:33.177 --> 00:33:35.880
SHARING INFORMATION- WITH LAW

00:33:35.947 --> 00:33:37.648
ENFORCEMENT IN SUCH A WAY THAT

00:33:37.715 --> 00:33:39.617
IT WOULD- PUT IN JEOPARDY THEIR

00:33:39.684 --> 00:33:42.587
IMMIGRATION STATUS OR DISCLOSE

00:33:42.653 --> 00:33:44.922
IT IN THAT IN THAT FASHION. SO

00:33:44.989 --> 00:33:48.059
I GUESS IF WE'RE SERIOUS ABOUT

00:33:48.126 --> 00:33:51.162
TACKLING THIS PANDEMIC. THEN WE

00:33:51.229 --> 00:33:52.697
NEED TO ACTIVATE ALL THE

00:33:52.764 --> 00:33:54.031
RESOURCES OF THE STATE OF

00:33:54.098 --> 00:33:56.567
CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN YES IN

00:33:56.634 --> 00:33:57.969
CERTAIN INSTANCES THAT MAY

00:33:58.035 --> 00:33:59.804
INCLUDE LAW ENFORCEMENT

00:33:59.871 --> 00:34:01.439
ESPECIALLY IN RURAL MOUNTAIN

00:34:01.506 --> 00:34:04.108
COMMUNITIES WHERE IT'S TERRIBLY

00:34:04.175 --> 00:34:06.577
RELEVANT. IN THEIR RELIED UPON

00:34:06.644 --> 00:34:09.847
IN THOSE SITUATIONS. SO FOR

00:34:09.914 --> 00:34:10.448
SERIOUS ABOUT DOING SOMETHING

00:34:10.515 --> 00:34:13.084
ABOUT THIS DON'T HANDCUFF. THE

00:34:13.151 --> 00:34:15.119
EFFORTS UNDER WAY THAT COULD BE

00:34:15.186 --> 00:34:17.288
TERRIBLY USEFUL FOR US

00:34:17.355 --> 00:34:19.690
OVERCOMING OUR SITUATION SO I

00:34:19.757 --> 00:34:21.225
WOULD RESPECTFULLY REQUEST MY

00:34:21.292 --> 00:34:24.328
COLLEAGUES. THIS IS ALREADY

00:34:24.395 --> 00:34:25.863
ADEQUATELY PROTECTED IN PRIOR

00:34:25.930 --> 00:34:28.032
LEGISLATION. THE IDEA THAT YOU

00:34:28.099 --> 00:34:30.401
WOULD STOP LAW ENFORCEMENT FROM

00:34:30.468 --> 00:34:32.937
PARTICIPATING AS NEEDED. LEAVE

00:34:33.004 --> 00:34:34.605
IT UP TO LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO

00:34:34.672 --> 00:34:35.606
DETERMINE WHETHER THEY HAVE THE

00:34:35.673 --> 00:34:38.176
RESOURCES. THAT IN CERTAIN

00:34:38.242 --> 00:34:39.510
CIRCUMSTANCES THEY WOULD NEED

00:34:39.577 --> 00:34:41.412
TO RELY ON LAW ENFORCEMENT LET

00:34:41.479 --> 00:34:43.514
THEM DECIDE. THE LEGISLATION

00:34:43.581 --> 00:34:45.316
ALREADY EXISTS THAT PROTECTS.

00:34:45.383 --> 00:34:46.784
ARE THOSE COMMUNITIES THAT

00:34:46.851 --> 00:34:48.486
WOULD OTHERWISE BE FEARFUL THIS

00:34:48.553 --> 00:34:50.888
PIECE OF LEGISLATION. LITERALLY

00:34:50.955 --> 00:34:53.157
SENDS THE WRONG MESSAGE THAT

00:34:53.224 --> 00:35:00.097
PERFECTLY THE WRONG TIME. DO

00:35:00.164 --> 00:35:01.632

MEASURES THAT WOULD DISALLOW.

00:35:33.431 --> 00:35:35.066
LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT FROM PART

00:35:35.132 --> 00:35:36.634
FROM COMMUNICATING WITH FEDERAL

YOU HAVE IN THIS BILL EXCLUDED

PLACE TO DISALLOW THAT I'M-

00:35:47.712 --> 00:35:49.213

S. NOW THIS IS NOT LIKE THIS.

00:36:03.060 --> 00:36:04.128
THE FLOOR SESSION WHERE PEOPLE

00:36:04.195 --> 00:36:06.130
CAN PRESENT THEIR BILL AND THEN

00:36:06.197 --> 00:36:07.431

WERE DEBATING BILLS AND WE'RE

00:36:12.003 --> 00:36:13.070
BETTING THEM SO THAT WE CAN

00:36:13.137 --> 00:36:14.839
DECIDE. WHETHER OR NOT THEY'RE

00:36:14.906 --> 00:36:16.674
WORTHY OF MOVING FORWARD FOR

00:36:16.741 --> 00:36:18.009
FULL SENATE VOTES ARE WOULD ASK

00:36:18.075 --> 00:36:19.877
MADAM CHAIR THAT. THE MEMBER

INFORMED DECISION ON THE BILL-

00:36:25.616 --> 00:36:28.152
A POINT WELL TAKEN- THE IF THIS

00:36:28.219 --> 00:36:29.954
IS PART OF A COLLOQUY RATHER

00:36:30.021 --> 00:36:32.657
THAN A STATEMENT- THAT DOESN'T.

00:36:32.723 --> 00:36:34.625
IT THAT ISN'T SEEKING THAT

00:36:34.692 --> 00:36:36.961
INTERACTION THEN CERTAINLY-

00:36:37.028 --> 00:36:39.330
ASSEMBLY MEMBER. PLEASE ANSWER

00:36:39.397 --> 00:36:40.598
PERHAPS THIS WILL LEAD TO SOME

00:36:40.665 --> 00:36:43.501
ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION AND IT

00:36:43.568 --> 00:36:47.371
ISN'T JUST A STATEMENT. I HAVE

00:36:47.438 --> 00:36:49.073
SOME EXPERIENCE HERE AND I

00:36:49.140 --> 00:36:50.775
DON'T HAVE FAITH THAT THIS WILL

00:36:50.841 --> 00:36:54.579
LEAD TO. SOME RABBIT HOLE- I DO

00:36:54.645 --> 00:36:57.081
RESPECT THE QUESTION AND SHE'S-ASKING AND I DO INTEND TO

00:36:57.148 --> 00:36:59.884

00:36:59.951 --> 00:37:01.986
THE LAST PART OF IT I DO INTEND

00:37:02.053 --> 00:37:02.987
TO ADDRESS IT BUT I'D LIKE TO

00:37:03.054 --> 00:37:05.323
HEAR FOR EXHAUSTIVE CONCERNED

00:37:05.389 --> 00:37:07.592
SO I CAN ADDRESS THEM AND HOLD.

00:37:07.658 --> 00:37:10.928
WELL I THINK. AGAIN IT IS. THIS

00:37:10.995 --> 00:37:12.330
IS A STRANGE PLACE TO BE

00:37:12.396 --> 00:37:14.498
HAVING. A CONVERSATION USUALLY

00:37:14.565 --> 00:37:16.601
WE DO IT IN A COMMITTEE ROOM.

00:37:16.667 --> 00:37:19.036
AND I THINK A CONVERSATION IS-

00:37:19.103 --> 00:37:20.438
IS WARRANTED IF THERE IS A

00:37:20.504 --> 00:37:23.374
DESIRE TO- CONTINUE. IN THAT

00:37:23.441 --> 00:37:24.442
FASHION AGAIN THERE'S A

00:37:24.508 --> 00:37:25.977
DIFFERENCE I SEE AT LEAST.

00:37:26.043 --> 00:37:28.579
BETWEEN MAKING A STATEMENT. AND

00:37:28.646 --> 00:37:31.415
GOING THROUGH- AN INQUIRY. SURE

00:37:31.482 --> 00:37:33.517
THANK YOU OKAY. ME PLEASE ASK

00:37:33.584 --> 00:37:34.785
YOUR QUESTION AGAIN. WELL MY

00:37:34.852 --> 00:37:37.321
QUESTION IS WHY WAS LAW

00:37:37.388 --> 00:37:38.856
ENFORCEMENT SPECIFICALLY

00:37:38.923 --> 00:37:40.691
EXCLUDED FROM YOUR BILL GIVEN

00:37:40.758 --> 00:37:42.526
THE FACT. THAT WE ALREADY HAVE

00:37:42.593 --> 00:37:44.128
PASSED A LAW THAT WOULD

00:37:44.195 --> 00:37:45.763
PROHIBIT THEM FROM

00:37:45.830 --> 00:37:47.965
COMMUNICATING AND COOPERATING

00:37:48.032 --> 00:37:49.000
WITH FEDERALLAW ENFORCEMENT

00:37:49.066 --> 00:37:51.702
OFFICIALS FOR THE PURPOSES OF

00:37:51.769 --> 00:37:52.737
IMMIGRATION SURE THIS IS JUST

00:37:52.803 --> 00:37:54.205
ONE SLICE OF WHAT THIS

00:37:54.271 --> 00:37:56.040
LEGISLATION ATTEMPTS TO DO.

00:37:56.107 --> 00:37:58.609
THAT LEGISLATION DOES MUCH MORE

00:37:58.676 --> 00:38:00.511
THAN THAT AND PROTECTING DATA

00:38:00.578 --> 00:38:02.747
OF INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE

00:38:02.813 --> 00:38:04.682
UNDERGOING CONTACT TRACING. BUT

00:38:04.749 --> 00:38:06.717
WHAT'S THE WHAT THE REAL GOAL

00:38:06.784 --> 00:38:09.654
HERE IN CONTACT TRACING HAVING

00:38:09.720 --> 00:38:11.222
IS HAVING A ROBUST SYSTEM. WE

00:38:11.288 --> 00:38:13.057
HAD VERY FEW RULES OR

00:38:13.124 --> 00:38:15.026
GUIDELINES WE'VE NEVER REALLY

00:38:15.092 --> 00:38:17.128
DONE THIS BEFORE AT SCALE. AND

00:38:17.194 --> 00:38:19.363
WITH THE TYPE OF EMERGENCY THAT

00:38:19.430 --> 00:38:21.866
WE ARE UNDER. SO THE GOAL

00:38:21.932 --> 00:38:23.901
SHOULD BE TO HAVE AS MUCH

00:38:23.968 --> 00:38:26.871
PARTICIPATION. IN CONTACT AS

00:38:26.937 --> 00:38:29.040
SOON AS POSSIBLE SO WHY NOT

00:38:29.106 --> 00:38:31.242
INCLUDE LAW ENFORCEMENT. SOON

00:38:31.308 --> 00:38:34.311
THEY'RE NOT THE ONES. THAT WE

00:38:34.378 --> 00:38:34.945
NEED TO ENCOURAGE PARTICIPATION

00:38:35.012 --> 00:38:36.981
FROM WE NEED TO HAVE

00:38:37.048 --> 00:38:38.916
PARTICIPATION FROM THOSE WHO

00:38:38.983 --> 00:38:43.287
EITHER HAVE CONTRACTED. OF THE

00:38:43.354 --> 00:38:44.789
NINETEEN OR MAY HAVE BEEN

00:38:44.855 --> 00:38:47.458
EXPOSED TO COPE AT NINETEEN AND

00:38:47.525 --> 00:38:49.794
EVERYTHING SHOWS US THAT THEY

00:38:49.860 --> 00:38:51.328
ARE NOT INTERESTED IN

00:38:51.395 --> 00:38:53.197
PARTICIPATING IN A CONTACT

00:38:53.264 --> 00:38:56.100
TRACING PROGRAM. THAT IS

00:38:56.167 --> 00:38:58.335
ENGAGED BY LAW ENFORCEMENT.

00:38:58.402 --> 00:38:59.770
OKAY SIR MADAM CHAIR I WON'T

00:38:59.837 --> 00:39:01.205
ASK ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS OF

00:39:01.272 --> 00:39:03.174
THE MEMBER I WILL JUST CONTINUE

00:39:03.240 --> 00:39:04.942
WITH MY OWN COMMENTS AND I AM

00:39:05.009 --> 00:39:08.279
VERY DISTURB FRANKLY THAT. THE

00:39:08.345 --> 00:39:10.114
SUGGESTION HAS BEEN MADE THAT

00:39:10.181 --> 00:39:12.249
LAW ENFORCEMENT DOES NOT NEED

00:39:12.316 --> 00:39:14.285
TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS PROGRAM

00:39:14.351 --> 00:39:17.054
WE HAVE ALREADY SEEN. INMATES

00:39:17.121 --> 00:39:20.257
HAVE HAD TO HAVE BEEN RELEASED%

00:39:20.324 --> 00:39:21.258
FROM OUR PRISONS BECAUSE OF A

00:39:21.325 --> 00:39:23.294
COVERT OUTBREAK AND THE PEOPLE

00:39:23.360 --> 00:39:25.730
WHO WORK IN THOSE INSTITUTIONS

00:39:25.796 --> 00:39:27.231
ARE LAW ENFORCEMENT THEY ARE

00:39:27.298 --> 00:39:28.866
ABSOLUTELY AT RISK IMPACT I

00:39:28.933 --> 00:39:32.236
WOULD ARGUE MORE SO. THEN SOME

00:39:32.303 --> 00:39:34.205
OTHER MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITY

00:39:34.271 --> 00:39:37.908
SO I REALLY I'M- I'M SHOCKED

00:39:37.975 --> 00:39:40.177
THAT YOU WOULD SUGGEST THAT LAW

00:39:40.244 --> 00:39:41.712
ENFORCEMENT NEED NOT

00:39:41.779 --> 00:39:42.546
PARTICIPATE THAT LAW

00:39:42.613 --> 00:39:43.781
ENFORCEMENT NEED NOT BE

00:39:43.848 --> 00:39:46.117
PROTECTED. AND THAT THEY ARE

00:39:46.183 --> 00:39:47.718
NOT ALLOWED TO PARTICIPATE IN A

00:39:47.785 --> 00:39:49.653
PROGRAM BECAUSE YOU THINK THAT

00:39:49.720 --> 00:39:51.722
THEY MIGHT USE IT FOR PURPOSES

00:39:51.789 --> 00:39:53.023
OF IMMIGRATION WHICH WE'VE

00:39:53.090 --> 00:39:55.960
ALREADY SAID YOU CANNOT DO SO I

00:39:56.026 --> 00:39:58.295
THINK THAT. WE'RE TRYING TO

00:39:58.362 --> 00:39:59.830
PROTECT THE HEALTH OF ALL THE

00:39:59.897 --> 00:40:00.998
MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITY THAT'S

00:40:01.065 --> 00:40:02.566
WHY WE'RE ALL WEARING MASKS AND

00:40:02.633 --> 00:40:04.835
WE'RE SOCIALLY DISTANCING AND I

00:40:04.902 --> 00:40:05.936
THINK WE OWE THAT TO OUR LAW

00:40:06.003 --> 00:40:08.405
ENFORCEMENT COMMUNITY IS WELL

00:40:08.472 --> 00:40:09.607
TO PROTECT THEM TOO BUT TO SAY

00:40:09.673 --> 00:40:11.242
THAT. WE'RE GOING TO PROTECT

00:40:11.308 --> 00:40:13.410
EVERY OTHER PERSON IN

00:40:13.477 --> 00:40:16.147
CALIFORNIA EXCEPT YOU LAW

00:40:16.213 --> 00:40:18.149
ENFORCEMENT I THINK THAT'S

00:40:18.215 --> 00:40:19.817
THAT'S A HORRIBLE. MESSAGE TO

00:40:19.884 --> 00:40:21.819
SEND AND IT'S CERTAINLY NOT

00:40:21.886 --> 00:40:23.087
SOMETHING THAT I'M GOING TO BE

00:40:23.154 --> 00:40:24.421

CASKEY THE FLOOR'S YOURS I KNOW

00:40:33.697 --> 00:40:34.932

00:40:36.167 --> 00:40:38.803
PRACTICAL DETAILS. I WANT TO

00:40:38.869 --> 00:40:41.005

AS THE EMPLOYER PART OF THE

00:40:45.009 --> 00:40:46.844
OBJECTION FOR THE OPPOSITION IS

HERE. AND RECOGNIZING THAT IT

01:16:39.328 --> 01:16:41.530
IS A TOOL. BUT IS IT IT'S A

01:16:41.596 --> 01:16:44.166
TOOL THAT COULD PROLIFERATE

01:17:21.870 --> 01:17:23.638
CONCERN WITH FOR EXAMPLE

01:17:23.705 --> 01:17:25.173
GEOLOCATION OUTSIDE THE

01:17:25.240 --> 01:17:28.443
WORKPLACE. BUT IN THIS TIME OF

01:17:28.510 --> 01:17:30.746
CRISIS IT DOES SEEM TO ME THAT

01:17:30.812 --> 01:17:32.547
THAT WE WANT TO BE AS-

01:17:32.614 --> 01:17:33.915
EFFICIENT AS POSSIBLE

01:17:33.982 --> 01:17:35.317
PARTICULARLY IN WORK PLACES

01:17:35.384 --> 01:17:36.618
WITH LARGE NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES

01:17:36.685 --> 01:17:38.153
THAT WE CAN DO CONTACT TRACING

01:17:38.220 --> 01:17:40.722
AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. AND TO

01:17:40.789 --> 01:17:43.392
THE EXTENT THAT EMPLOYEE- DOES

01:17:43.458 --> 01:17:45.494
HAVE SOME OF HIS OR HER PRIVACY

01:17:45.560 --> 01:17:49.231
RIGHTS- IMPACTED THE THAT THIS

01:17:49.297 --> 01:17:49.898
MAY BE A TIME WHERE WE NEED TO

01:17:49.965 --> 01:17:52.034
DO STUFF BUT I'LL LEAVE THAT.

01:17:52.100 --> 01:17:55.570
UP I HAVE I HAVE CONCERNS

01:17:55.637 --> 01:17:57.806
STRONG CONCERNS. IN APPRECIATE

01:17:57.873 --> 01:17:59.608
THAT AND I THINK THE ASSEMBLY

01:17:59.674 --> 01:18:00.809
MEMBERS VERY WILLING TO WORK

01:18:00.876 --> 01:18:02.077
THROUGH THE COMMITTEE AND MAKE

01:18:02.144 --> 01:18:03.045
SURE THAT SOME OF THOSE

01:18:03.111 --> 01:18:04.446
CONCERNS TO GET ADDRESSED

01:18:04.513 --> 01:18:06.348
BECAUSE AGAIN I BELIEVE MISTER

01:18:06.415 --> 01:18:08.016
CHARLES GOALS NOT TO PROHIBIT

01:18:08.083 --> 01:18:09.284
THE APPS OR MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE

01:18:09.351 --> 01:18:11.520
FOR THEM TO WORK. BUT TO SET A

01:18:11.586 --> 01:18:13.722
CLEAR EXPECTATION FOR THE

01:18:13.789 --> 01:18:15.457
EMPLOYEE WHEN THEY DOWNLOAD

01:18:15.524 --> 01:18:19.361
THAT APP WHEN THAT HAPPENS

01:18:19.428 --> 01:18:21.229
TRACKING THEM. AND IT IN PLACES

01:18:21.296 --> 01:18:22.764
THAT THAT IN IN WAYS THAT THEY

01:18:22.831 --> 01:18:24.433
MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE OTHERWISE

01:18:24.499 --> 01:18:26.468
THE ANTICIPATED. AND I THINK

01:18:26.535 --> 01:18:28.470
IT'S A DANGEROUS ROAD TO STEP

01:18:28.537 --> 01:18:29.071
DOWN AND I KNOW WE HAVE TO DO

01:18:29.137 --> 01:18:30.372
EVERYTHING WE CAN TO DO CONTACT

01:18:30.439 --> 01:18:33.108
TRACING. BUT BECAUSE OF THE

01:18:33.175 --> 01:18:36.111
POWER OF THESE DEVICES AND

01:18:36.178 --> 01:18:37.312
THEIR ABILITY. TO COLLECT

01:18:37.379 --> 01:18:38.480
MANAGE AND DISTRIBUTE

01:18:38.547 --> 01:18:40.949
INFORMATION FAIRLY BROADLY.

01:18:41.016 --> 01:18:42.617
INCLUDING IF IT IS A THIRD

01:18:42.684 --> 01:18:44.686
PARTY. APPLICATION THAT

01:18:44.753 --> 01:18:46.621
EMPLOYER NOW IS ASKING TO BE

01:18:46.688 --> 01:18:49.324
DOWNLOADED ON SOMEBODY'S. PHONE

01:18:49.391 --> 01:18:51.760
IF THAT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN

01:18:51.827 --> 01:18:52.594
THE APP PROVIDER AND THE

01:18:52.661 --> 01:18:54.696
EMPLOYER OR ARE NOT CLEAR

01:18:54.763 --> 01:18:57.566
ENOUGH. THEN THAT DATA CAN GO.

01:18:57.632 --> 01:18:58.633
WHO KNOWS WHERE IT COULD IN

01:18:58.700 --> 01:19:00.135
FACT BE OWNED BY THE

01:19:00.202 --> 01:19:04.840
APPLICATION. AND THE

01:19:04.906 --> 01:19:06.041
APPLICATION DEVELOPER AND THEIR

01:19:06.108 --> 01:19:07.776
COMPANY RATHER THAN EVEN THE

01:19:07.843 --> 01:19:10.178
EMPLOYER. SO IF THAT'S

01:19:10.245 --> 01:19:12.080
SOMETHING THAT'S CLEAR THEN YES

01:19:12.147 --> 01:19:14.816
I WOULD EXPECT A LOT I WOULD

01:19:14.883 --> 01:19:15.417
CERTAINLY NOT WANT TO SIGN UP

01:19:15.484 --> 01:19:17.119
FOR THAT. BUT I WOULD WANT TO

01:19:17.185 --> 01:19:18.787
HAVE THE OPTION TO BUY A PLAYER

01:19:18.854 --> 01:19:20.989

TAKE A LOOK AT IT IF YOU THINK

01:19:26.128 --> 01:19:29.631
WE'VE DONE A GOOD ENOUGH JOB.CONSENT TO IT AND THN WE CAN

01:19:29.698 --> 01:19:31.666
COVER THAT GROUND IF NOT THE

01:19:31.733 --> 01:19:33.468
EMPLOYER MAY NEED TO DO. TO

01:19:33.535 --> 01:19:36.071
AUGMENT THE APPLICATION. FOR

01:19:36.138 --> 01:19:36.605
THOSE WHO DO NOT WANT TO

01:19:36.671 --> 01:19:39.608
SUBSCRIBE. WITH OTHER METHODS

01:19:39.674 --> 01:19:40.542
TO BE ABLE TO COLLECT THAT

01:19:40.609 --> 01:19:42.043
INFORMATION THIS HAS NOTHING TO

01:19:42.110 --> 01:19:44.579
DO WITH OTHER METHODS. THANK

01:19:44.646 --> 01:19:47.415

01:19:47.482 --> 01:19:53.255
BORCHERS. THIS IS CERTAINLY A

01:19:53.321 --> 01:19:56.791
BALANCING ACT I THINK. LAST

01:19:56.858 --> 01:19:58.126
YEAR WE SPENT A GOOD AMOUNT OF

01:19:58.193 --> 01:19:59.961
TIME ON PRIVACY RELATED MATTERS

01:20:00.028 --> 01:20:03.632
IN FACT ON THE CHAIR AND NINE

01:20:03.698 --> 01:20:05.934
FIVE SPENT- EVEN MORE TIME ON

01:20:06.001 --> 01:20:09.804
RESEARCHING. HOW OTHER PARTS OF

01:20:09.871 --> 01:20:12.874
THE COUNTRY AND OTHER PARTS OF

01:20:12.941 --> 01:20:15.043
THE WORLD ARE MANAGING

01:20:15.110 --> 01:20:18.280
PRESERVATION OF PRIVATE DATA.

01:20:18.346 --> 01:20:21.516
SO WHAT WE HAVE HERE IS WE HAVE.

01:20:21.583 --> 01:20:23.885
CONSTITUTIONAL EXPECTATIONS AND

01:20:23.952 --> 01:20:27.622
WE HAVE A BONA FIDE EMERGENCY.

01:20:27.689 --> 01:20:29.124
I IN I GUESS I'D LIKE TO ASK

01:20:29.191 --> 01:20:30.725
QUESTIONS I MAY THROUGH THE

01:20:30.792 --> 01:20:36.731
CHAIR TO. THE THIS IS NOT THE

01:20:36.798 --> 01:20:39.100
ALTERNATOR FINE JOB OF MY DAD.

01:20:39.167 --> 01:20:45.340
HEY WHY IS THIS NOT MANDATORY

01:20:45.407 --> 01:20:47.142
CAN YOU CAN YOU CAN YOU RECITE

01:20:47.209 --> 01:20:49.010
JUST A LITTLE BIT ON THE

01:20:49.077 --> 01:20:50.412
RATIONALE AS TO WHY THIS WAS

01:20:50.478 --> 01:20:54.216
NOT- WHY THIS DIDN'T GO THE

01:20:54.282 --> 01:20:56.551
DIRECTION OF A MANDATORY-

01:20:56.618 --> 01:20:59.321
POLICY BUT- I GUESS IN A CLEAR

01:20:59.387 --> 01:21:01.723
ON THE QUESTION THAT IT'S NOT

01:21:01.790 --> 01:21:04.492
MANDATING WHAT WHAT IS IT YEAH

01:21:04.559 --> 01:21:05.427
BECAUSE MY UNDERSTANDING IS

01:21:05.493 --> 01:21:08.930
THAT THIS IS VOLUNTARY THAT THE

01:21:08.997 --> 01:21:10.665
INDIVIDUAL CAN. THE RULES ARE

01:21:10.732 --> 01:21:12.601
THAT WOULD GO ALONG WITH THIS-

01:21:12.667 --> 01:21:14.236
WOULD PROTECT DATA BUT THE

01:21:14.302 --> 01:21:16.037
TRACING ITSELF IT WOULD BE

01:21:16.104 --> 01:21:18.073
VOLUNTARY FOR THOSE THAT WISH

01:21:18.139 --> 01:21:19.908
TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS EVENT A

01:21:19.975 --> 01:21:21.343
TERRY AGAIN THIS BILL HAS

01:21:21.409 --> 01:21:23.778
NOTHING TO DO WITH CONTRACT

01:21:23.845 --> 01:21:26.514
TRACING PER SE IT ONLY HAS THE

01:21:26.581 --> 01:21:28.783
IT'S WITH APPLICATION SO THAT

01:21:28.850 --> 01:21:31.886
THE CONTACT TRACING. ITSELF

01:21:31.953 --> 01:21:34.289
THIS IS SILENT ON AND DOESN'T

01:21:34.356 --> 01:21:35.457
DEAL WITH THAT IT'S REALLY IF

01:21:35.523 --> 01:21:36.925
THE IF THE EMPLOYER WANTS TO

01:21:36.992 --> 01:21:38.960
USE A PARTICULAR APPLICATION

01:21:39.027 --> 01:21:40.795
AGO RIGHT THERERIGHT YOU THINK

01:21:40.862 --> 01:21:41.696
IT WOULD USE A PARTICULAR

01:21:41.763 --> 01:21:45.767
APPLICATION. THEN THE WHAT THIS

01:21:45.834 --> 01:21:46.334
IS SAYING IS THAT CANNOT BE

01:21:46.401 --> 01:21:49.571
MADE. OBLIGATORY ON AN EMPLOYEE

01:21:49.638 --> 01:21:50.438
THAT'S THAT'S WHAT I'M GETTING

01:21:50.505 --> 01:21:53.174
AT YEAH SO WHY IS IT SO YOU'RE

01:21:53.241 --> 01:21:54.509
GIVING THE EMPLOYEE THE WITH

01:21:54.576 --> 01:21:57.112
THE OPTION TO DOWNLOAD THE APP

01:21:57.178 --> 01:21:59.047
OR WHATEVER FORM OF TECHNOLOGY.

01:21:59.114 --> 01:22:02.083
THE PRESS. WHY IS IT IS IN THAT.

01:22:02.150 --> 01:22:04.719
MADE MANDATORY WHAT HAS BEEN

01:22:04.786 --> 01:22:07.722
EMPLOYEE MUST. SUBSCRIBE THEM

01:22:07.789 --> 01:22:11.426
SELVES TO THIS TYPE OF SERVICE

01:22:11.493 --> 01:22:13.895
THAT WOULD HELP THE PUBLIC FOR

01:22:13.962 --> 01:22:15.163
PURPOSES OF TRACING DOWN THE

01:22:15.230 --> 01:22:18.633
ROAD OKAY BECAUSE BUT I THINK

01:22:18.700 --> 01:22:20.535
THAT'S A LITTLE BIT OF ALARMING

01:22:20.602 --> 01:22:22.837
PERSPECTIVE BECAUSE THE

01:22:22.904 --> 01:22:23.438
EMPLOYEE NONE OF US KNOW WHAT

01:22:23.505 --> 01:22:25.140
THAT APPLICATION IS. THE DATA

01:22:25.206 --> 01:22:27.242
THAT IT COLLECTS WHO OWNS THAT

01:22:27.309 --> 01:22:29.577
DATA HOW IT'S BEING USED AND SO

01:22:29.644 --> 01:22:31.346
FOR AN EMPLOYER WHO MAY OR MAY

01:22:31.413 --> 01:22:33.114
NOT HAVE DONE THEIR RESEARCH

01:22:33.181 --> 01:22:34.149
AND ARE JUST BUYING AN

01:22:34.215 --> 01:22:36.451
APPLICATION AND SAY YOU MUST

01:22:36.518 --> 01:22:40.588
USE THIS APPLICATION. THREE

01:22:40.655 --> 01:22:41.122
DIFFERENT THAT AN EMPLOYER

01:22:41.189 --> 01:22:41.956
INSTALLING. THE WORD PROCESSING

01:22:42.023 --> 01:22:43.024
APPLICATION ON THE COMPUTERS

01:22:43.091 --> 01:22:44.659
AND SAY YOU MUST USE THIS I'VE

01:22:44.726 --> 01:22:45.727
BEEN IN THAT SITUATION AND IT'S

01:22:45.794 --> 01:22:47.028
BEEN VERY DEVASTATING WHEN IT'S

01:22:47.095 --> 01:22:48.396
AN APPLICATION THAT I DON'T

01:22:48.463 --> 01:22:50.365
PARTICULARLY CARE FOR. BUT I

01:22:50.432 --> 01:22:51.599
DON'T HAVE A CHOICE IN THAT

01:22:51.666 --> 01:22:53.468
CASE IN THIS CASE. THE

01:22:53.535 --> 01:22:54.969
APPLICATION CAN HAVE SOME VERY

01:22:55.036 --> 01:22:57.238
SIGNIFICANT PERSONAL ISSUES FOR

01:22:57.305 --> 01:22:59.107
THAT EMPLOYEE AND IF THE

01:22:59.174 --> 01:23:00.675
EMPLOYER HASN'T DONE THEIR JOB

01:23:00.742 --> 01:23:02.310
AND WE MANDATE THAT THE

01:23:02.377 --> 01:23:05.347
EMPLOYEE NOW DOWNLOADS. THE

01:23:05.413 --> 01:23:06.881
WHATEVER IT HAPPENS TO BE

01:23:06.948 --> 01:23:08.450
BECAUSE WE'RE NOT SPECIFYING

01:23:08.516 --> 01:23:10.218
WHAT THE APPLICATION IS WE'RE

01:23:10.285 --> 01:23:13.254
JUST SAYING THAT YOU CAN'T.

01:23:13.321 --> 01:23:16.458
HOISTED ON AN EMPLOYEE NOW IF

01:23:16.524 --> 01:23:17.492
THE EMPLOYER HAS DONE THEIR

01:23:17.559 --> 01:23:19.794
JOB. AND HAS BUILT

01:23:19.861 --> 01:23:20.929
INAPPROPRIATE RELATIONSHIP WITH

01:23:20.995 --> 01:23:22.630
THE APP BELPER AND CAN

01:23:22.697 --> 01:23:23.665
ARTICULATE THIS IS WHAT WE'RE

01:23:23.732 --> 01:23:25.133
TRYING TO DO. THIS IS HOW YOUR

01:23:25.200 --> 01:23:27.936
DATA GETS USED THIS IS WHO OWNS

01:23:28.002 --> 01:23:29.003
YOUR DATA. THIS IS VERY VERY

01:23:29.070 --> 01:23:30.705
IMPORTANT TO DO I DON'T

01:23:30.772 --> 01:23:32.607
UNDERSTAND WHY MOST EMPLOYEES

01:23:32.674 --> 01:23:34.809
WOULDN'T SAY OKAY I TRUST MY

01:23:34.876 --> 01:23:36.578
EMPLOYER I TRUST THE SITUATION.

01:23:36.644 --> 01:23:38.246
BUT THIS REALLY IS ASKING THAT

01:23:38.313 --> 01:23:41.383
EMPLOYEE THE EMPLOYER TO TAKE

01:23:41.449 --> 01:23:42.484
THAT ADDITIONAL STEP. IN ORDER

01:23:42.550 --> 01:23:44.185
TO ARTICULATE. WHY THIS IS

01:23:44.252 --> 01:23:45.754
SOMETHING THAT THE EMPLOYEE

01:23:45.820 --> 01:23:48.089
SHOULD USE THAN THEY CAN OPT IN

01:23:48.156 --> 01:23:50.558
AND BE A PART OF IT. I THINK

01:23:50.625 --> 01:23:51.559
EMPLOYEES THEMSELVES LIKE ALL

01:23:51.626 --> 01:23:53.995
OF US WANT TO STAY SAFE FROM UP.

01:23:54.062 --> 01:23:55.897
SO DO I ONE CONTRACT CONTACT

01:23:55.964 --> 01:23:57.399
TRACING BEING DONE FOR THOSE

01:23:57.465 --> 01:23:59.067
THAT INTERACT WITH YES.

01:23:59.134 --> 01:24:01.803
ABSOLUTELY DO I WANT TO HAVE TO

01:24:01.870 --> 01:24:03.204
USE THE TOOL THAT IMAY NOT

01:24:03.271 --> 01:24:04.906
KNOW NOTHING ABOUT THAT HAS

01:24:04.973 --> 01:24:07.409
TREMENDOUS PERSONAL AND PRIVACY

01:24:07.475 --> 01:24:08.676
IMPLICATIONS ENTER. I'M GONNA

01:24:08.743 --> 01:24:10.612
BE A LITTLE BIT MORE RELUCTANT

01:24:10.678 --> 01:24:11.946
ABOUT THAT SIR UNLESS I'VE HAD

01:24:12.013 --> 01:24:14.983
A CHANCE TO DO MY HOMEWORK SO

01:24:15.049 --> 01:24:15.583
THAT'S REALLY WHAT THIS BILL.

01:24:15.650 --> 01:24:18.820
IS SETTING UP. THANK YOU VERY

01:24:18.887 --> 01:24:21.656
MUCH- AND I THINK GOING BACK TO

01:24:21.723 --> 01:24:23.591
THE BALANCING ACT THAT- CENTER

01:24:23.658 --> 01:24:26.861
HERTZBERG I'M NOT HERTZBERG ON

BURKE HAD TALKED ABOUT. I AM I

01:24:29.330 --> 01:24:31.633
BELIEVE THAT WE- ARE IN A

01:24:31.699 --> 01:24:32.867
SITUATION WHERE CERTAIN

01:24:32.934 --> 01:24:35.103
SAFEGUARDS NEED TO BE PUT INTO

01:24:35.170 --> 01:24:37.906
PLACE. NGUYEN APPS ARE

01:24:37.972 --> 01:24:40.475
DOWNLOADED. I FRANKLY BELIEVE

01:24:40.542 --> 01:24:42.877
THAT UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES

01:24:42.944 --> 01:24:43.611
THAT SINCE WE'RE NOT IN A

01:24:43.678 --> 01:24:46.781
POSITION. TO GET A HANDLE ON

01:24:46.848 --> 01:24:49.984
THIS PANDEMIC. THAT PUBLIC

01:27:07.255 --> 01:27:08.389
TROUBLE EVEN GETTING PEOPLE

01:27:08.456 --> 01:27:10.792
JUST TO WEAR MASKS. LET ALONE

01:27:10.858 --> 01:27:13.361
HAVE THEM AGREE. TO PROVIDE

01:27:13.428 --> 01:27:14.796

DIRECTION WHEN AN APPLICATION

01:27:34.315 --> 01:27:35.683
IS THE APPROACH THAT AN

01:27:35.750 --> 01:27:37.552
EMPLOYER WANTS TO USE IT

01:27:37.619 --> 01:27:39.554

THAT SAID IT IS A BALANCING ACT

AND I THINK. I GUESS THE

01:31:30.418 --> 01:31:31.819
QUESTION IS A PART OF THE

MIGHT BE COLLECTED. IT'S A

01:31:48.502 --> 01:31:50.605
QUESTION TO THE- THROUGH THE

01:31:50.671 --> 01:31:52.473
CHAIR THE CHAIR ASSEMBLY MEMBER

DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT

01:31:55.176 --> 01:31:56.677
QUESTION AND THAT'S SOMETHING

01:31:56.744 --> 01:31:58.746
THAT WE CAN CERTAINLY GET FOR

01:31:58.813 --> 01:32:00.481

EXPECT THAT HAPPENS AND THAT'S

01:32:10.324 --> 01:32:10.892
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE SEE

01:32:10.958 --> 01:32:12.727
WITH MOST APPLICATIONS IS THIS

01:32:12.793 --> 01:32:14.562
IS HOW YOUR DATA IS BEING USED

01:32:14.629 --> 01:32:17.098
CORRECT AND I THINK THAT WOULD

01:32:17.164 --> 01:32:18.099
HELP. TO GET MORE

01:32:18.165 --> 01:32:20.735
PARTICIPATION. THIS SUPPORTS

01:32:20.801 --> 01:32:22.270
THE PUBLIC HEALTH AND WORKER

01:32:22.336 --> 01:32:24.772
HEALTH OBJECTIVE. IF PART OF

01:32:24.839 --> 01:32:27.275
THAT INFORMED CONSENT. REQUIRES

01:32:27.341 --> 01:32:29.677
THE EMPLOYER TO SAY COLLECTED

01:32:29.744 --> 01:32:31.445
FOR THIS PURPOSE FOR NO OTHER

01:32:31.512 --> 01:32:35.683
PURPOSE WILL BE DESTROYED BY

01:32:35.750 --> 01:32:37.118
SUCH AND SUCH A DATE. IT CITRIX.

01:32:37.184 --> 01:32:39.186
THAT COULD BUILD CONFIDENCE.

01:32:39.253 --> 01:32:41.055
THAT EXERCISE OF WHETHER AN

01:32:41.122 --> 01:32:43.424
EMPLOYEE CHOSE. TO OPT IN OR

01:32:43.491 --> 01:32:45.993
OPT OUT. I WAS ALSO INTERESTED

01:32:46.060 --> 01:32:47.528
NOT TO SEE PUBLIC HEALTH

01:32:47.595 --> 01:32:50.164
OFFICERS. LISTED IN SUPPORT OR

01:32:50.231 --> 01:32:52.233
OPPOSITION AND THEN I DID HEAR

01:32:52.300 --> 01:32:53.067
THE PHONE CALLS WHERE THEY SAID

01:32:53.134 --> 01:32:55.636
THEY WERE. STILL FORMULATING A

01:32:55.703 --> 01:32:57.972
POSITION AND I THINK. ALL THE

01:32:58.039 --> 01:33:01.042
PEOPLE- THE INTEREST GROUPS

01:33:01.108 --> 01:33:03.377
LARGELY TECHNOLOGY GROUPS FORM

01:33:03.444 --> 01:33:06.714
PLAYER GROUPS- I THINK THERE

01:33:06.781 --> 01:33:08.215
NEEDS TO BE A PUBLIC HEALTH

01:33:08.282 --> 01:33:11.886
VOICE. IN HERE AS WELL BECAUSE-

01:33:11.953 --> 01:33:14.488
IT IS A BALANCING ACT. I AM A

01:33:14.555 --> 01:33:16.757
STRONG PROTECTOR OF INDIVIDUAL

01:33:16.824 --> 01:33:20.261
RIGHTS CIVIL LIBERTIES- PRIVACY

01:33:20.328 --> 01:33:22.763
RIGHTS. BUT WHEN WE HAVE A

01:33:22.830 --> 01:33:25.266
PUBLIC HEALTH EPIDEMIC. IN THE

01:33:25.333 --> 01:33:28.235
REFUSAL. OF A WORKER. TO

01:33:28.302 --> 01:33:31.639
PARTICIPATEIN. AN ASPECT OF

01:33:31.706 --> 01:33:33.908
SCREENING THAT COULD PROVE TO

01:33:33.975 --> 01:33:37.745
HELP. OTHER CO WORKERS- STAY

01:33:37.812 --> 01:33:40.648
SAFE AD HEALTHY FATS FOR ME

01:33:40.715 --> 01:33:42.383
WHERE IT GETS KIND OF TOUGH TO

01:33:42.450 --> 01:33:43.551
SAY THERE SHOULD NEVER BE AN

01:33:43.617 --> 01:33:47.755
EXCEPTION. TO THE SHARING OF

01:33:47.822 --> 01:33:50.358
INFORMATION I IT DOES HELP ME

01:33:50.424 --> 01:33:51.425
TO UNDERSTAND IT DOESN'T

01:33:51.492 --> 01:33:53.594
PROHIBIT OTHER TYPES OF TRACING

01:33:53.661 --> 01:33:56.230
THIS IS SIMPLY RELATED IF THIS

01:33:56.297 --> 01:33:58.466
PARTICULAR APPLICATION OR- A

01:33:58.532 --> 01:34:02.136
COMPUTER APPLICATION. WOULD BE.

01:34:02.203 --> 01:34:04.171
RECOMMENDER BY AN EMPLOYER FOR

01:34:04.238 --> 01:34:06.007
THEIR WORK FORCE FOR THE

01:34:06.073 --> 01:34:08.209
PURPOSE OF PROTECTING EVERYONE

01:34:08.275 --> 01:34:10.111
IN THE WORK FORCE- SO THAT'S

01:34:10.177 --> 01:34:11.545
WHERE I STRUGGLE WITH THIS I

01:34:11.612 --> 01:34:13.381
WOULDN'T NORMALLY STRUGGLE WITH

01:34:13.447 --> 01:34:16.517
THE PRIVACY RELATED BILL- I CAN

01:34:16.584 --> 01:34:18.352
I WILL BE SUPPORTING IT TODAY

01:34:18.419 --> 01:34:20.087
BUT IT WOULD BE HELPFUL FOR ME

01:34:20.154 --> 01:34:23.090
TO HEAR FROM THE AUTHOR- IF AS

01:34:23.157 --> 01:34:24.392
PART OF THIS IF IT MOVES

01:34:24.458 --> 01:34:26.394
FORWARD AND MOVES INTO LAW.

01:34:26.460 --> 01:34:28.496
THAT ANY EMPLOYER SEEKING TO

01:34:28.562 --> 01:34:30.564
USE SUCH AN APPLICATION WOULD

01:34:30.631 --> 01:34:34.201
HAVE TO MAKE. AN EMPLOYEE AWARE

01:34:34.268 --> 01:34:37.171
OF THE PROTECTIONS IF THEY WERE

01:34:37.238 --> 01:34:39.540
TO OFTEN- SO THAT I'M JUST KIND

01:34:39.607 --> 01:34:40.908
OF CLOSING WITH THE STATEMENT

01:34:40.975 --> 01:34:42.610
NOT REALLY A QUESTION THAT IN

01:34:42.676 --> 01:34:44.412
AND IF YOU WANNA COME IN YEAH

01:34:44.478 --> 01:34:46.247
IT WELL. FROM MY STANDPOINT I

01:34:46.313 --> 01:34:47.982
WOULD TEND TO AGREE AND THAT'S

01:34:48.049 --> 01:34:50.684
PART OF THE EMPLOYER BEING ABLE

01:34:50.751 --> 01:34:52.119
TO ENSURE TO SIMPLY THAT THIS

01:34:52.186 --> 01:34:54.021
IS THE RIGHT WAY TO GO AS I

01:34:54.088 --> 01:34:55.456
THINK MOST EMPLOYEES IF YOU

01:34:55.523 --> 01:34:56.424
THINK ABOUT IT ARE GOING TO

01:34:56.490 --> 01:34:57.691
WANT TO BE PART OF CONTACT

01:34:57.758 --> 01:35:01.162
TRACING SOME AREN'T. BUT

01:35:01.228 --> 01:35:01.695
HOPEFULLY THAT'S A REALLY

01:35:01.762 --> 01:35:03.664
MINIMAL. MOST WILL END PART OF.

01:35:03.731 --> 01:35:05.332
ENSURING THAT THAT EMPLOYEE

01:35:05.399 --> 01:35:06.867
DOES OPT INTO THIS PARTICULAR

01:35:06.934 --> 01:35:08.436
METHOD OF CONTACT TRACING.

01:35:08.502 --> 01:35:10.037
THAT'S IMPORTANT AND I KNOW

01:35:10.104 --> 01:35:12.740
THAT THAT. I'M SORRY I CAN'T

01:35:12.807 --> 01:35:13.974
ANSWER ALL THE QUESTIONS ABOUT

01:35:14.041 --> 01:35:15.643

WITH YOU. ON AREAS THAT CAN

01:35:22.550 --> 01:35:25.419
HELP CLARIFY AND SOLIDIFY TO

ENSURE THAT THIS GETS DONE

01:35:27.154 --> 01:35:30.624
MISTRUST. NOT TRY TO PREVENT

01:35:30.691 --> 01:35:31.192
THESE APPS FROM BEING USED.

01:35:31.258 --> 01:35:31.826
JUSTIN THAT THAT THEY'RE BEING

01:35:31.892 --> 01:35:34.195
USED IN AN APPROPRIATE WAY SO

01:35:34.261 --> 01:35:35.963

SOME PARAMETERS LEGITIMATE

01:37:30.444 --> 01:37:32.413
GUIDELINES TO THE COMPANY BUT

01:37:32.479 --> 01:37:34.715
AGAIN IT'S NOT THE ONLY AVENUE

01:37:34.782 --> 01:37:35.816
WE'VE BEEN DOING CONTACT

01:37:35.883 --> 01:37:41.121
TRACING OF FOR DECADES- IN THIS

01:37:41.188 --> 01:37:42.389
HEALTH ISSUES WE DO A FOR

BEEN DOING THAT FOR YEARS.

01:37:45.059 --> 01:37:48.262
WHICH ARE NON APPLICATION BASED

01:37:48.329 --> 01:37:50.531
SO THERE ARE OTHER OPTIONS- BUT

01:37:50.598 --> 01:37:52.132
WE DO WE REALLY WANT TO MAKE

01:37:52.199 --> 01:37:54.835
SURE THAT THAT THE PEOPLE ARE-

01:37:54.902 --> 01:37:57.404

WE KNOW. YOU KNOW THAT THE

01:38:09.883 --> 01:38:11.485
FOLKS WHO THINK OF IT AS A HOAX

01:38:11.552 --> 01:38:13.354
AS I MENTIONED THEY- THAT THEY

01:38:13.420 --> 01:38:18.125

01:38:22.162 --> 01:38:24.999
AVENUE IF WE DO SEE A GREATER

01:38:25.065 --> 01:38:27.601
USE OF APPLICATIONS AND I THINK

01:38:27.668 --> 01:38:29.336
THIS DOES BALANCES PRIVACY

01:38:29.403 --> 01:38:31.038
ISSUES BUT AGAIN THIS IS A BILL

01:38:31.105 --> 01:38:32.106
THERE ARE AMENDMENTS THAT ARE

01:38:32.172 --> 01:38:33.974
STILL BEING DISCUSSED. I THINK

01:38:34.041 --> 01:38:36.110
THE PURPOSE THE FOCUS IN THE

01:38:36.176 --> 01:38:37.411
PARAMETERS THAT ARE SET FORTH

01:38:37.478 --> 01:38:39.813

THAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR SO- WITH

01:38:44.451 --> 01:38:46.620

MONEY WAS FOCUSED ON AND THAT

01:39:00.167 --> 01:39:02.736
IS YOU KNOW IN THAT WORKPLACE.

01:39:02.803 --> 01:39:06.006
WE REALLY HAVE TO DO MORE TO

01:39:06.073 --> 01:39:08.242
PROTECT ALL THOSE WORKERS. WE

01:39:08.309 --> 01:39:10.711
ARE FINDING EVERY SINGLE DAY IN

01:39:10.778 --> 01:39:13.814
THE NEWSPAPER- WORKPLACES

01:39:13.881 --> 01:39:17.551
WORKED AS HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE-

01:39:17.618 --> 01:39:21.422

AND- WE HAVE TO DO A MUCH MUCH

01:39:23.824 --> 01:39:26.560
TIGHTER JOB. AND I AGREE THERE

01:39:26.627 --> 01:39:28.729
IS OF COURSE A PRIVACY ISSUE

01:39:28.796 --> 01:39:31.165
BUT THERE IS A PUBLIC HEALTH

01:39:31.231 --> 01:39:33.067
ISSUE AND THERE'S A PUBLIC

01:39:33.133 --> 01:39:34.068
HEALTH ISSUE FOR PEOPLE IN YOUR

01:39:34.134 --> 01:39:36.203
WORKPLACE YOU GO TO WORK. YOU

01:39:39.973 --> 01:39:41.442
GOING TO BE SAFE AND HEALTHY

01:39:41.508 --> 01:39:45.946
FOR YOU- AND IT'S SO- IT SEEMS

01:39:46.013 --> 01:39:48.148
TO ME WE HAVE TO HAVE A SYSTEM

01:39:48.215 --> 01:39:51.051
THAT COVERS ALL THE WORKERS OR

01:39:51.118 --> 01:39:53.454
ELSE IT'S- USELESS. YOU KNOW AS

01:39:53.520 --> 01:39:55.889
FAR AS WHAT WE WHAT WE NEED FOR

01:39:55.956 --> 01:39:58.225
TO PROTECT THOSE WORKERS SO. IF

01:39:58.292 --> 01:40:01.061
AN EMPLOYEE REFUSES TO SIGN THE

01:40:01.128 --> 01:40:02.496
HIP A RELEASE AND IF YOU DON'T

01:40:02.563 --> 01:40:04.965
HAVE SOME SYSTEM LIKE A THE

01:40:05.032 --> 01:40:06.934
TECHNOLOGY TO MAKE UP FOR IT.

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:09.436
THEN THEN YOU'RE NOT GOING TO

01:40:09.503 --> 01:40:12.272
BE TRACED. AT ALL AND- ALL THE

01:40:12.339 --> 01:40:15.576

01:40:20.881 --> 01:40:22.416
REAL CONCERNS I'M NOT SURE

01:40:22.483 --> 01:40:24.151
ABOUT ALL THE ANSWERS I'VE

01:40:24.218 --> 01:40:29.556
SEEN- IDEAS ABOUT AMENDMENTS TO

01:40:29.623 --> 01:40:32.159
THIS ABOUT MAKING IT SURE THAT

01:40:32.226 --> 01:40:34.528
IT'S LIMITED TO THE WORKPLACE

01:40:34.595 --> 01:40:36.463
SO IT DOESN'T GO BEYOND THAT SO

01:40:36.530 --> 01:40:40.033
OUR PRIVACY IS PROTECTED OF. SO

01:40:40.100 --> 01:40:41.068
I THINK THAT THERE ARE

01:40:41.135 --> 01:40:43.570
DEFINITELY WAYS TO AMEND THIS

01:40:43.637 --> 01:40:46.407
IN SUCH A WAY THAT WILL GIVE US

01:40:46.473 --> 01:40:47.541
WHAT WHAT WE ALL ARE LOOKING

01:40:47.608 --> 01:40:53.514
FOR- SO I'D LIKE TO URGE. THE

01:40:53.580 --> 01:40:55.282
AUTHORED THROUGH THE PRESENTER

TO PLEASE LOOK AT A MORE

01:40:57.251 --> 01:41:00.154
SERIOUS WAYS OF AMENDING THIS

01:41:00.220 --> 01:41:02.222
BILL FOR THE COULD HAVE OUR

01:41:02.289 --> 01:41:05.259
FULL SUPPORT AT LEAST WITH

01:41:05.325 --> 01:41:07.327
REGARDS TO ME. THANK YOU.

01:41:07.394 --> 01:41:09.763
SENATOR STERN AND I THINK THAT

01:41:09.830 --> 01:41:12.433
IS THE LAST INCREASE CENTER

01:41:12.499 --> 01:41:14.835
STERNECK NO. CENTER GONZALEZ

01:41:14.902 --> 01:41:16.804
WILL GO NEXT TO CHEDDARS DURING

01:41:16.870 --> 01:41:18.639
THE FLOOR IS YOURS. OKAY THANK

01:41:18.705 --> 01:41:21.542
YOU MANAGER- THANKS FOR THIS

01:41:21.608 --> 01:41:23.410
INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT ABATE IT

01:41:23.477 --> 01:41:24.077
SORT OF DAWNED ON ME THAT THIS

01:41:24.144 --> 01:41:26.380
COMMITTEE. IS REALLY THE FIRST

01:41:26.447 --> 01:41:27.915
MEANINGFUL PLACE IN THE

01:41:27.981 --> 01:41:30.017
LEGISLATURE THAT WE'VE READ

01:41:30.083 --> 01:41:31.218
STARTED WRESTLING WITH THESE

01:41:31.285 --> 01:41:34.388
HUGE AND CRUCIAL ISSUES SO-

01:41:34.455 --> 01:41:35.722
APPRECIATE THE RIGOR WITH WHICH

01:41:35.789 --> 01:41:36.824
YOU'VE ALLOWED THE DEBATE TO

01:41:36.890 --> 01:41:40.727
TAKE PLACE MADAM CHAIR AND- YOU

01:41:40.794 --> 01:41:42.996
KNOW I. THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF

01:41:43.063 --> 01:41:45.032
TALK THROUGH THIS BILL ABOUT.

01:41:45.098 --> 01:41:46.233
THERE WILL BE AMENDMENTS OR

01:41:46.300 --> 01:41:48.202
CONSIDERATION OF AMENDMENTS

01:41:48.268 --> 01:41:49.636
THIS IS A PROCEDURAL POINT I'M

01:41:49.703 --> 01:41:52.072
TRYING TO GET A SENSE. IF THIS

01:41:52.139 --> 01:41:54.641
BILL IS AMENDED- IN SOME

01:41:54.708 --> 01:41:58.545
SUBSTANTIAL WAY GOING FORWARD

01:41:58.612 --> 01:41:59.146
ARE WE GONNA HAVE A CHANCE TO

01:41:59.213 --> 01:42:04.418
SEE THIS AGAIN- OR IS THIS. I

01:42:04.485 --> 01:42:05.018
DON'T KNOW TIMING WISE ARE THE

01:42:05.085 --> 01:42:05.886
IS GONNA WORK BUT I'M A LITTLE

01:42:05.953 --> 01:42:07.721
WORRIED ABOUT TAKING A VOTE

01:42:07.788 --> 01:42:09.790
TODAY AND THEN. YOU KNOW WE

01:42:09.857 --> 01:42:11.425
COULD LOOK ENTIRELY DIFFERENT

01:42:11.492 --> 01:42:13.126
LATER ON WE DON'T GET GET A

01:42:13.193 --> 01:42:15.095
SECOND BITE AT THE APPLE. YEAH

01:42:15.162 --> 01:42:16.463
I DON'T I DON'T THINK THE BILLS

01:42:16.530 --> 01:42:17.931
CAN LOOK ENTIRELY DIFFERENT I

01:42:17.998 --> 01:42:21.168
THINK THAT THE AUTHOR AND- THIS

01:42:21.235 --> 01:42:22.569
COMMITTEE ARE PAYING VERY CLOSE

01:42:22.636 --> 01:42:24.104
ATTENTION TO THE CONCERNS THAT

01:42:24.171 --> 01:42:26.273
HAVE BEEN ARTICULATED. I THINK

01:42:26.340 --> 01:42:28.642
THAT THE BILL HAS IT HAS MOVED

01:42:28.709 --> 01:42:30.277
HAS BEEN TIGHTENED

01:42:30.344 --> 01:42:33.013
CONSIDERABLY- THE BILL'S NEXT

01:42:33.080 --> 01:42:34.781
JOURNEY IS TO APPROPRIATIONS

01:42:34.848 --> 01:42:36.683
WERE OF COURSE YOU KNOW.

01:42:36.750 --> 01:42:39.353
AMENDMENTS CAN AND ARE LIKELY

01:42:39.419 --> 01:42:41.989
TO BE TAKEN THEN WE ARE IN A

01:42:42.055 --> 01:42:44.157
RATHER CONSTRICTED TIME FRAME-

01:42:44.224 --> 01:42:48.462
BUT- I THINK AT THIS POINT WITH

01:42:48.529 --> 01:42:49.029
THE WORK THAT'S BEEN DONE ON

01:42:49.096 --> 01:42:50.430
THIS BILL. THE HARD WORK BY THE-

01:42:50.497 --> 01:42:52.065
BY THE AUTHOR AND THE STAFF OF

01:42:52.132 --> 01:42:54.001
THIS COMMITTEE I THINK WE HAVE

01:42:54.067 --> 01:42:57.704
MOVED ALONG- TO A POINT WHERE-

01:42:57.771 --> 01:42:59.640
I WON'T SAY IT PROTOCOL TO

01:42:59.706 --> 01:43:02.075
TWEAK. BUT I THINK WE'RE CLOSE

01:43:02.142 --> 01:43:02.976
TO THE POINT WHERE WE JUST NEED

01:43:03.043 --> 01:43:06.747
TO- PERHAPS- CLARIFY A LITTLE

01:43:06.813 --> 01:43:11.251
BIT MORE- SIGNIFICANTLY JUST

01:43:11.318 --> 01:43:13.086
WHAT THIS BILL DOES AND DOESN'T

01:43:13.153 --> 01:43:14.855
DO BUT IN TERMS OF RE WRITING

01:43:14.922 --> 01:43:16.056
THE BILL. AND GOING IN A

01:43:16.123 --> 01:43:18.125
DIFFERENT DIRECTION- THAT'S NOT

01:43:18.191 --> 01:43:20.027
GONNA HAPPENOKAY I BET THAT'S

01:43:20.093 --> 01:43:21.862
YOUR HELPFUL I'M CAN I JUST

01:43:21.929 --> 01:43:23.530
ASK- IT JUST A SUBSTANTIVE

01:43:23.597 --> 01:43:24.898
QUESTION OF THE AUTHOR HERE.

01:43:24.965 --> 01:43:27.668
WELL WITHOUT OBJECTION TO THE

01:43:27.734 --> 01:43:30.203

RATE. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER.

01:43:36.009 --> 01:43:39.012
SO THE- I'M I'M TRYING TO

01:43:39.079 --> 01:43:40.581
SQUARE THIS I KNOW YOU'RE NOT

01:43:40.647 --> 01:43:43.216
THE AUTHOR OF SIX SIXTY BUT THE

01:43:43.283 --> 01:43:45.118
DEFINITION WE JUST WENT THROUGH

01:43:45.185 --> 01:43:46.453
LOOKING AT CONTACT TRACING

01:43:46.520 --> 01:43:48.422
WRITTEN LARGE AND NOT BEING

01:43:48.488 --> 01:43:51.325
ABLE TO USE THAT INFORMATION

01:43:51.391 --> 01:43:53.026
FOR ANY OTHER PURPOSES OTHER

01:43:53.093 --> 01:43:55.629
THAN CONTACT TRACING. THAT SEEM

01:43:55.696 --> 01:43:58.765
TO BE COMPREHENSIVE- YOUR THE

01:43:58.832 --> 01:44:00.601
BILL HERE AS YOU RIGHTLY POINT

01:44:00.667 --> 01:44:01.802
OUT DEALS WITH JUST THE

01:44:01.868 --> 01:44:04.137
TECHNOLOGY ASSISTED CONTACT

01:44:04.204 --> 01:44:05.672
TRACING RIGHT THAT SUBSET THAT

01:44:05.739 --> 01:44:10.277
ACT SET. I I'M I'M TRYING TO

01:44:10.344 --> 01:44:13.013
FIGURE OUT WHY WE NEED TO START

01:44:13.080 --> 01:44:16.583
A SECOND LAYER OF PROTECTION IF

01:44:16.650 --> 01:44:17.951
WE'RE ALREADY SAYING YOU CAN

01:44:18.018 --> 01:44:20.253
ONLY USE THAT CONTACT TRACING

01:44:20.320 --> 01:44:21.254
ANY KIND OF CONTACT TRACING

01:44:21.321 --> 01:44:23.256
INFO FOR CONTACT TRACING

01:44:23.323 --> 01:44:26.026
PURPOSES ONLY WHY WE HAVE TO

01:44:26.093 --> 01:44:29.896
HAVE A SECOND SET OF

01:44:29.963 --> 01:44:32.499
RESTRICTIONS IN HERE. JUST FOR

01:44:32.566 --> 01:44:36.003
A TECHNOLOGY SPECIFIC KIND.

01:44:36.069 --> 01:44:38.372
SURE CENTER AND I THINK THE

01:44:38.438 --> 01:44:39.773
REASON IS BECAUSE OF THE NATURE

01:44:39.840 --> 01:44:42.809
OF APPLICATIONS AND HOW THOSE

01:44:42.876 --> 01:44:43.243
GET USED I THINK THE

01:44:43.310 --> 01:44:45.946
EXPECTATION IS THAT THAT

01:44:46.013 --> 01:44:47.648
INFORMATION THAT IS BEING USED

01:44:47.714 --> 01:44:50.117
DURING KIND CONTACT TRACING AND

01:44:50.183 --> 01:44:51.184
MOST OF THE BILLS DEALING WITH

01:44:51.251 --> 01:44:52.252
THAT ARE DEALING IN THE LARGER

01:44:52.319 --> 01:44:55.756
SENSE OF CONTACT FACING ANY OF

01:44:55.822 --> 01:44:56.356
THE TOOLS THAT MIGHT GET USED

01:44:56.423 --> 01:44:58.392
FOR CONTACT TRACING. THIS IS

01:44:58.458 --> 01:45:00.560
INCOMPATIBLE WITH THAT BUT IT

01:45:00.627 --> 01:45:03.096
IS CLARIFYING. THAT IF YOU'RE

01:45:03.163 --> 01:45:04.431
GOING TO USE AN APPLICATION AND

01:45:04.498 --> 01:45:05.999
REMEMBER THE APPLICATION BY ITS

01:45:06.066 --> 01:45:08.535
NATURE. IS COLLECTING MORE

01:45:08.602 --> 01:45:11.204
INFORMATION. THAN SOMEONE

01:45:11.271 --> 01:45:13.807
NECESSARILY WOULD THROUGH USING

01:45:13.874 --> 01:45:15.642
OTHER TOOLS BECAUSE IF IT IS

01:45:15.709 --> 01:45:17.477
DOING IF IT IS TRACKING THE

01:45:17.544 --> 01:45:19.413
MOVEMENTS OF AN INDIVIDUAL FOR

01:45:19.479 --> 01:45:22.416
EXAMPLE. THEN THAT INFORMATION

01:45:22.482 --> 01:45:24.084
IS BEING COLLECTED AND STORED

01:45:24.151 --> 01:45:26.253
SOMEWHERE AND YES WHICH ONLY

01:45:26.319 --> 01:45:28.355
SUPPOSED TO BE BEING USED FOR

01:45:28.422 --> 01:45:32.626
CONTACT TRACING. BUT BECAUSE WE

01:45:32.693 --> 01:45:33.260
HAVEN'T SPECIFIED WHO OWNS THAT

01:45:33.326 --> 01:45:35.295
WHERE DATA IS COMING FROM. AND

01:45:35.362 --> 01:45:36.396
IT MIGHT BE THE COMPANY WITH

01:45:36.463 --> 01:45:37.397
THE RESPONSIBILITY OR AN

01:45:37.464 --> 01:45:39.866
ORGANIZATION WITH

01:45:39.933 --> 01:45:40.434
RESPONSIBILITY OF DOING THE

01:45:40.500 --> 01:45:41.168
CONTACT TRACING AND YET THE

01:45:41.234 --> 01:45:42.269
DATA THAT COMES OUT OF THE

01:45:42.335 --> 01:45:44.738
APPLICATION ITSELF. MAY RESIDE

01:45:44.805 --> 01:45:47.007
IN B. OWN SOMEPLACE OUT. WE'RE

01:45:47.074 --> 01:45:49.509
JUST TRYING TO DO. A LITTLE BIT

01:45:49.576 --> 01:45:51.311
OF BELT AND SUSPENDERS HERE.

01:45:51.378 --> 01:45:53.046
ENSURING THAT ANY INFORMATION

01:45:53.113 --> 01:45:54.581
COLLECTED THROUGH THE

01:45:54.648 --> 01:45:56.550
APPLICATION BECAUSE THAT'S ALL

01:45:56.616 --> 01:45:57.050
WE'RE LOOKING AT IS THE

01:45:57.117 --> 01:45:58.885
APPLICATION ITSELF. IS BEING

01:45:58.952 --> 01:46:00.587
MANAGED IN SUCH A WAY AS WE

01:46:00.654 --> 01:46:02.589
WOULD EXPECT. SO I DON'T AS

01:46:02.656 --> 01:46:04.691
LONG AS THOSE DEFINITIONS AND

01:46:04.758 --> 01:46:06.526
THE PROTECTIONS ARE SIMILAR

01:46:06.593 --> 01:46:10.030
THERE'S REALLY NO HARM HERE BUT

01:46:10.097 --> 01:46:10.897
THERE ARE OTHER. WHO HAVE

01:46:10.964 --> 01:46:12.666
ACCESS TO THIS INFORMATION

01:46:12.733 --> 01:46:15.435
POTENTIALLY DEPENDING ON HOW

01:46:15.502 --> 01:46:16.470
THE APP GETS WRITTEN. AND WHOSE

01:46:16.536 --> 01:46:18.004
IT IS AND WHERE IT RESIDES IN

01:46:18.071 --> 01:46:20.507
AND HOW IT FUNCTIONS. THAT WE

01:46:20.574 --> 01:46:21.775
NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT ALL

01:46:21.842 --> 01:46:23.276
OF THOSE PARTIES ARE BROUGHT IT

01:46:23.343 --> 01:46:26.379

01:46:26.446 --> 01:46:27.981
THAT IT IS ART OF THE SELLING

01:46:28.048 --> 01:46:29.716

ABOUT WHAT THE LIMITATIONS ARE

01:46:37.224 --> 01:46:39.993
ON THAT DATA. BECAUSE YOU'RE

GOING TO SAY THIS CAN ONLY BE

01:46:46.500 --> 01:46:48.502
USED IN THE SENSE. BUT AS WE

THIS TOOL. AND YOU HAVE THE

01:47:46.960 --> 01:47:49.763
RIGHT AT ANY TIME TO OPT OUT OF

01:47:49.830 --> 01:47:51.598
THAT TOOL AND I GUESS I DON'T

01:47:51.665 --> 01:47:53.700
SEE THIS THE SAME WAY AS LIKE.

01:47:53.767 --> 01:47:55.101
A CONSUMER GOING ON THE

01:47:55.168 --> 01:47:57.103
INTERNET NOT WANTING TO HAVE

01:47:57.170 --> 01:47:59.306
ADS SERVED ON THEM WERE YOU

01:47:59.372 --> 01:48:01.074

PRIVACY CONTEXT YOU KNOW MINE

01:48:03.343 --> 01:48:05.745

01:48:13.620 --> 01:48:15.021
SAME KIND OF. FRAMEWORK THAT

01:48:15.088 --> 01:48:16.590

CPA IN THE- AND THE ANALYSIS

01:48:20.694 --> 01:48:21.928
AND IT SEEMS LIKE WE'RE SORT OF

01:48:21.995 --> 01:48:23.129
USING THAT AS THE BASELINE

01:48:23.196 --> 01:48:24.564
FRAMEWORK THIS IS NOT A

01:48:24.631 --> 01:48:27.033
CONSUMER. FRAMEWORK AT ALL THIS

01:48:27.100 --> 01:48:29.636
IS ABOUT. THE FOR MY FREEDOM TO

01:48:29.703 --> 01:48:32.873
GO TO WORK AND FEEL SAFE- IS

01:48:32.939 --> 01:48:34.541
CONTINGENT UPON OTHER PEOPLE

01:48:34.608 --> 01:48:36.610
PLAYING BY THE SAME RULES AS ME

01:48:36.676 --> 01:48:38.311
AND I DON'T WANT THOSE WHO WANT

01:48:38.378 --> 01:48:40.280
TO BE REBELS. AND GO GET

01:48:40.347 --> 01:48:42.382
COVETING COME INTO WORK.

01:48:42.449 --> 01:48:43.350

SAFELY SO THAT THAT'S MY

01:48:50.490 --> 01:48:53.159
CONCERN IS NOT JUST THE

01:48:53.226 --> 01:48:53.793

THAT APP HAS BEEN APPROPRIATELY

01:49:46.479 --> 01:49:47.514
VETTED AND APPROVED WE THOUGHT

01:49:47.580 --> 01:49:48.982

POSSIBILITY IF NOT REALLY WHAT

THEM THAT'S FINE IN THIS CASE.

01:50:11.104 --> 01:50:12.739
IT'S NOT INVALIDATING THE TOOL

01:50:12.806 --> 01:50:14.841
BECAUSE THE ORGANIZATION CAN

01:50:14.908 --> 01:50:16.977
STILL USE THE TOOL. BUT AN

01:50:17.043 --> 01:50:19.646

02:19:03.001 --> 02:19:04.035
ISN'T NEEDED BECAUSE CURRENT

02:19:04.102 --> 02:19:06.471
LAW ALLOWS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO

02:19:06.538 --> 02:19:08.339
ENACT AND ENFORCE CLOSE

02:19:08.406 --> 02:19:10.108
ORDINANCES FOR WHICH THEY DO.

02:19:10.175 --> 02:19:11.009
AND IF YOU BELIEVE IN THE

02:19:11.076 --> 02:19:13.745
PROMISE OF THE NINE NINE NINE

02:19:13.812 --> 02:19:14.846
BUT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AMERICAN

02:19:14.913 --> 02:19:15.980
SOLDIERS JURISDICTIONS KNOW

02:19:16.047 --> 02:19:18.016
BEST HOW TO DO THIS. AND WHAT

02:19:18.083 --> 02:19:19.718
DO YOU HAVE THAT SAME STATE

02:19:19.784 --> 02:19:21.019
THAT THE SAME JURISDICTIONS

02:19:21.086 --> 02:19:23.888
WILL BE ABLE TO DO A PARK

02:19:23.955 --> 02:19:24.456
CLOSURE ORDINANCE. WE DON'T

02:19:24.522 --> 02:19:25.824
KNOW WHY THIS BILL ONLY APPLIES

02:19:25.890 --> 02:19:27.358
TO MOBILE HOMES WHY WOULD YOU

02:19:27.425 --> 02:19:29.260
SIMPLY APPLY TO ONE TYPE OF

02:19:29.327 --> 02:19:31.563
PROPERTY WHEN A PART. WENT OUT

02:19:31.629 --> 02:19:33.231
WALMART'S ONE NOT LIQUOR STORES

02:19:33.298 --> 02:19:35.700
IF IT'S SO CRITICAL THAT WE GET

02:19:35.767 --> 02:19:36.234
LOW INCOME AND AFFORDABLE

02:19:36.301 --> 02:19:38.536
HOUSING. IMPORTANTLY WHY SHOULD

02:19:38.603 --> 02:19:39.504
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE THEIR

02:19:39.571 --> 02:19:42.040
HANDS TIED AT THE MOMENT IN

02:19:42.107 --> 02:19:42.807
TIME WHEN THEY GO TO CLOSE THE

02:19:42.874 --> 02:19:44.509
PARK. VERSUS BEING ABLE TO FILL

02:19:44.576 --> 02:19:46.511
THEIR HOUSING ELEMENT WHICH

02:19:46.578 --> 02:19:48.313
LASTS FIVE YEARS. AT THE END OF

02:19:48.379 --> 02:19:49.881
FIVE YEARS IF THEY'RE HOUSING

02:19:49.948 --> 02:19:51.916
ELEMENT DOESN'T TAKE INTO

02:19:51.983 --> 02:19:53.685
ACCOUNT LOW INCOME AND MODERATE

02:19:53.752 --> 02:19:54.285
INCOME HOUSING. WOULD BE. YOU

02:19:54.352 --> 02:19:57.422
CAN. I'M FINE WORKING WITH ONE

02:19:57.489 --> 02:19:58.556
OF OUR ATTORNEYS WHO IS THE

02:19:58.623 --> 02:20:00.258
PERSON THAT DOES PARK CLOSURES

02:20:00.325 --> 02:20:01.526
AND HER SIXTEEN YEARS OF DOING

02:20:01.593 --> 02:20:03.061
THIS SHE HAS NEVER WORKED ON A

02:20:03.128 --> 02:20:04.863
PARK CLOSURE THAT HAS RESULTED

02:20:04.929 --> 02:20:07.232
IN A COMMERCIAL CHANGE EVERY

02:20:07.298 --> 02:20:08.233
SINGLE PART BECAUSE SHE'S

02:20:08.299 --> 02:20:09.934
WORKED ON HAVE BEEN FOR HOUSING

02:20:10.001 --> 02:20:11.636
AND SO IN THAT REGARD WE

02:20:11.703 --> 02:20:13.538
BELIEVE IT'S INCORRECT THAT

02:20:13.605 --> 02:20:15.073
EVERY PART CLOSURE THAT OCCURS

02:20:15.140 --> 02:20:16.441
AS BEEN FOR HOUSING. AND

02:20:16.508 --> 02:20:20.178
FINALLY PART CLOSURES TAKE FOUR

02:20:20.245 --> 02:20:21.079

02:20:21.146 --> 02:20:23.782

TWO SEVENTY. THAT MOVE TO NINE

02:20:30.822 --> 02:20:31.389
NINE NINE BECAUSE WE'RE LIMITED

02:20:31.456 --> 02:20:31.956
THE REASON I KNOW NINE ONE

02:20:32.023 --> 02:20:32.690
KILLED IN THE US COME WAS

02:20:32.757 --> 02:20:33.258
BECAUSE WE SHOULD THAT INTO

02:20:33.324 --> 02:20:35.393
LIKES STERN AND IT'S UNDER AND

02:20:35.460 --> 02:20:37.061
THUNDER WERE IS THIS BILL WILL

02:20:37.128 --> 02:20:38.429

ANY SENSE. IT'S BAD PUBLIC

02:20:58.249 --> 02:20:59.851

PLENTIFUL. AS APARTMENTS. THAT

TAKES ON THE RESPONSIBILITY.

02:30:47.271 --> 02:30:49.874

WERE GIVEN TWO HUNDRED AND

02:31:32.082 --> 02:31:32.550
FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR

02:31:32.616 --> 02:31:34.485

APARTMENT BUILDING ON THAT VERY

02:31:37.955 --> 02:31:41.559
SAME PROPERTY AT THE EXACT SAME

02:31:41.625 --> 02:31:42.460

THANK YOU MY OF MY LAST MY LAST

02:31:48.566 --> 02:31:51.869
FALL OR I THINK YOU HAD

02:31:51.936 --> 02:31:52.703
MENTIONED EARLIER THAT. THERE

02:31:52.770 --> 02:31:55.139
ARE SUFFICIENT LEGAL SAFEGUARDS

02:31:55.206 --> 02:31:57.141
THAT EXIST WITHIN THE STATE AND

02:31:57.208 --> 02:31:58.309
CERTAINLY AT THE AT THE LOCAL

02:31:58.375 --> 02:32:01.545
LEVEL. IN YOUR OPINION THAT

02:32:01.612 --> 02:32:04.849
THIS LEGISLATION IS NOT. NEEDED

02:32:04.915 --> 02:32:06.550
CAN YOU EXPAND A LITTLE BIT

02:32:06.617 --> 02:32:10.387
MORE ON. YOUR POINTS EARLIER

02:32:10.454 --> 02:32:10.921
BECAUSE I WASN'T CERTAIN I

02:32:10.988 --> 02:32:12.790
CAUGHT ALL OF THEM. THANK YOU

02:32:12.857 --> 02:32:15.159
YES. WE WOULD EXPECT BASED ON

02:32:15.226 --> 02:32:16.360
THE CONTENTION OF THE BILL THAT

02:32:16.427 --> 02:32:17.828
THERE WOULD BE AN EXAMPLE OF

02:32:17.895 --> 02:32:19.830
WHERE PARK CLOSE AND RESIDENTS

02:32:19.897 --> 02:32:20.764
WEREN'T GIVEN ADEQUATE

02:32:20.831 --> 02:32:22.333
COMPENSATION OR RELOCATION

02:32:22.399 --> 02:32:23.968
COSTS. TO GET THOSE EXAMPLES

02:32:24.034 --> 02:32:26.070
WERE NEVER GIVEN WHICH MEANS

02:32:26.136 --> 02:32:28.372
THAT OVER THE PAST TWO DECADES

02:32:28.439 --> 02:32:29.473
OF MOBILE HOME PARK CLOSURES

02:32:29.540 --> 02:32:30.608
THAT ARE TURNING TO THE WORKING

02:32:30.674 --> 02:32:32.409
ON THE REALLY HASN'T BEEN A

02:32:32.476 --> 02:32:33.244
PROBLEM BECAUSE LOCAL

02:32:33.310 --> 02:32:34.812
GOVERNMENTS REALLY DO ADDRESS

02:32:34.879 --> 02:32:36.714
THE CONCERNS OF THE RESIDENTS

02:32:36.780 --> 02:32:38.382
NOT THE PARK OWNER BECAUSE THEY

02:32:38.449 --> 02:32:39.683
DON'T WANT. FIVE HUNDRED

02:32:39.750 --> 02:32:40.885
RESIDENTS ON THEIR DOORSTEP

02:32:40.951 --> 02:32:43.187
COMPLAINING ABOUT COST AND SO

02:32:43.254 --> 02:32:44.855
WE HAVEN'T SEEN THOSE EXAMPLE

02:32:44.922 --> 02:32:46.090
SO WE'RE NOT SURE WHY THIS BILL

02:32:46.156 --> 02:32:47.658
IS EVEN NEEDED BECAUSE

02:32:47.725 --> 02:32:50.394
NOTHING'S BEEN SHOWN TO BE

02:32:50.461 --> 02:32:50.961
BROKEN OVER THE PAST TWENTY

02:32:51.028 --> 02:32:55.833
YEARS. OKAY THANK YOU. I THINK

02:32:55.900 --> 02:32:59.870
AND ALL IT ALL IN HERE THAT.

02:32:59.937 --> 02:33:02.306
WE'VE DEALT WITH RENT CONTROL.

02:33:02.373 --> 02:33:05.009
ISSUES IS- THIS YEAR AND

02:33:05.075 --> 02:33:07.244
CERTAINLY LAST YEAR. AND IT

02:33:07.311 --> 02:33:09.413
COMES DOWN I THINK PHILOSOPHY

02:33:09.480 --> 02:33:12.249
DO YOU BELIEVE THAT. EITHER

02:33:12.316 --> 02:33:14.018
DIRECTLY FROM THE STATE OR

02:33:14.084 --> 02:33:16.186
INDIRECTLY FROM THE LOCALITY.

02:33:16.253 --> 02:33:20.124
THAT RENT CONTROL WOULD HELP-

02:33:20.190 --> 02:33:22.293
OUR HOUSING STOCK. I THINK

02:33:22.359 --> 02:33:23.827
BASED ON THE CONVERSATIONS THAT

02:33:23.894 --> 02:33:26.997
I'VE HAD WITH WITH BUILDERS.

02:33:27.064 --> 02:33:29.233
WITH FOLKS THAT CAPITALIZE.

02:33:29.300 --> 02:33:32.336
THOSE IN DEVELOPMENT- AND THOSE

02:33:32.403 --> 02:33:33.704
THAT MIGHT OTHERWISE BE

02:33:33.771 --> 02:33:36.307
INTERESTED IN. INCREASING THE

02:33:36.373 --> 02:33:41.111
HOUSING STOCK. IS THAT. WHEN

02:33:41.178 --> 02:33:43.147
YOU DISINCENTIVE VISE THE

02:33:43.213 --> 02:33:46.283
MARKET IN SUCH A WAY IT WILL

02:33:46.350 --> 02:33:48.619
ACTUALLY COMPOUND THE PROBLEM I

02:33:48.686 --> 02:33:50.621
DON'T MEAN UNDERVALUED THAT THE

02:33:50.688 --> 02:33:53.390
ISSUES AND- IN AREAS THAT I

02:33:53.457 --> 02:33:57.928
THINK HAVE OUT PRICED. OF

02:33:57.995 --> 02:33:58.562
VIRTUALLY EVERYBODY AND I THINK

02:33:58.629 --> 02:33:59.229
WE KNOW THE EXAM OF SOME OF THE

02:33:59.296 --> 02:34:00.397
BARE AND ELSEWHERE WHERE PEOPLE

02:34:00.464 --> 02:34:04.234
JUST SIMPLY CAN'T AFFORD TO PAY

02:34:04.301 --> 02:34:06.337
THE OUTRAGEOUS RATES. BUT I

02:34:06.403 --> 02:34:08.238
WOULD CAUTION. AS A MATTER OF

02:34:08.305 --> 02:34:10.040
POLICY. THAT THOSE LIMITED

02:34:10.107 --> 02:34:13.143
INSTANCES. ON THE COAST BE

02:34:13.210 --> 02:34:16.513
APPLIED STATEWIDE AS POLICY.

02:34:16.580 --> 02:34:20.751
RENT CONTROL IS A DISINCENTIVE

02:34:20.818 --> 02:34:21.952
TO INVESTING IN OUR HOUSING

02:34:22.019 --> 02:34:25.155
STOCK. AND I THINK THERE'S BEEN

02:34:25.222 --> 02:34:27.891
ENOUGH STUDIES- ON THE SUBJECT

02:34:27.958 --> 02:34:30.894
THAT. IT COMES DOWN TO A

02:34:30.961 --> 02:34:33.197
PHILOSOPHICAL STANDPOINT BUT

02:34:33.263 --> 02:34:35.299
IT'S NOT A FACTUAL ONE SO MY

02:34:35.366 --> 02:34:39.603
OPINION- WHEN YOU ADD IN. ALL

02:34:39.670 --> 02:34:40.938
THESE DIFFERENT CONSIDERATIONS

02:34:41.005 --> 02:34:42.539
WE HAVE TO ASK OURSELVES ARE WE

02:34:42.606 --> 02:34:44.508
ACTUALLY HELPING OUR HOUSING

02:34:44.575 --> 02:34:46.644
STOCK. BY THIS TYPE OF PIECE OF

02:34:46.710 --> 02:34:49.446
LEGISLATION OR THOSE SIMILAR

02:34:49.513 --> 02:34:50.948
AND I THINK THE ANSWER'S GOING

02:34:51.015 --> 02:34:53.484
TO PROVE- THAT WE'RE NOT GOING

02:34:53.550 --> 02:34:54.718
TO MOVE THE NEEDLE IN

02:34:54.785 --> 02:34:56.253
CALIFORNIA. WITH OUR HOUSING

02:34:56.320 --> 02:34:58.288
CRISIS IN WAYS THAT WE

02:34:58.355 --> 02:35:00.257
OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE IMAGINED

02:35:00.324 --> 02:35:01.191
AND ULTIMATELY IT'S A IT'S A

02:35:01.258 --> 02:35:04.895
DOOMED- ALMOST IRREVERSIBLE

02:35:04.962 --> 02:35:10.501
PROCESS. THANK YOU SEEN NO

02:35:10.567 --> 02:35:12.770
OTHER HAND UP THE WHICH IS ONE

02:35:12.836 --> 02:35:14.672
OF THE POINT OUT THE MOBILE

02:35:14.738 --> 02:35:16.540
HOME PARKS ARE NOT THE SAME AS

02:35:16.607 --> 02:35:19.710
APARTMENT BUILDINGS YOU ARE THE

02:35:19.777 --> 02:35:21.345
MOBILE HOME IS REALLY NOT VERY

02:35:21.412 --> 02:35:24.848
MOBILE. AND SO THEY ARE IN A

02:35:24.915 --> 02:35:27.685
BIND IF THE PARK CLOSES IT'S

02:35:27.751 --> 02:35:28.318
NOT LIKE AN APARTMENT BUILDING

02:35:28.385 --> 02:35:30.821
THAT. SHUTS DOWN BECAUSE UNLIKE

02:35:30.888 --> 02:35:32.356
TENANT IN AN APARTMENT BUILDING

02:35:32.423 --> 02:35:34.458
THE MOBILE HOMEOWNER LOSES A

02:35:34.525 --> 02:35:36.760
MAJOR ASSET WHICH IS HIS OR HER

02:35:36.827 --> 02:35:41.632
HOME. SO AND IT'S OFTEN THEIR

02:35:41.699 --> 02:35:44.401
ONLY MAJOR ASSET- SO I THINK

02:35:44.468 --> 02:35:46.136
THIS BILL DOES A BETTER JOB OF

02:35:46.203 --> 02:35:47.971
COMPENSATING THEM FOR THAT LOSS

02:35:48.038 --> 02:35:49.773
AND I THINK THE AMENDMENTS MAKE

02:35:49.840 --> 02:35:51.709
CLEAR WE ARE NOT TYING THE

02:35:51.775 --> 02:35:54.178
HANDS OF THE LOCALS WHEN THEY

02:35:54.244 --> 02:35:55.879
DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT TO

02:35:55.946 --> 02:35:58.082
APPROVE A PARK CLOSURE TO CALL

02:35:58.148 --> 02:36:01.151
THE PARK OWNERS BUT NINE IS

02:36:01.218 --> 02:36:03.020
PROBABLY A FIRST IN MY- CAREER

02:36:03.087 --> 02:36:04.621
HERE AT THE- THE BATTLES

02:36:04.688 --> 02:36:06.990
BETWEEN THE A PARK OWNERS IN

02:36:07.057 --> 02:36:09.026
THE HOMEOWNERS ARE LEGEND- AND

02:36:09.093 --> 02:36:13.464
CONTINUE. TO THIS VERY DAY- THE

02:36:13.530 --> 02:36:15.265
QUESTION OF RENT CONTROL.

02:36:15.332 --> 02:36:17.201
NOTHING IN THE BILL REQUIRES

02:36:17.267 --> 02:36:19.670
LOCAL JURISDICTIONS- TO IMPOSE

02:36:19.737 --> 02:36:22.740
RENT CONTROL. ON MOBILE HOMES-

02:36:22.806 --> 02:36:24.374
AND IF THEY DECIDE TO DO IT

02:36:24.441 --> 02:36:25.609
NOTHING REQUIRES LOCAL

02:36:25.676 --> 02:36:28.145
JURISDICTIONS. TO APPLY THAT

02:36:28.212 --> 02:36:29.680
RENT CONTROL TO LONG TERM

02:36:29.747 --> 02:36:33.016
LEASES SO- I THINK WE HAVE TO

02:36:33.083 --> 02:36:34.685
BE CLEAR WITH THIS BILL DOES

02:36:34.752 --> 02:36:38.956
AND DOESN'T TO. AND I SEE THIS

02:36:39.022 --> 02:36:40.324
BILL ALSO IS RETURNING LOCAL

02:36:40.390 --> 02:36:44.728
CONTROL ON ON THIS ISSUE AND-

02:36:44.795 --> 02:36:48.832
IF THE OPPONENTS THINK THAT

02:36:48.899 --> 02:36:50.567
EXEMPTING LONG TERM LEASES FROM

02:36:50.634 --> 02:36:51.769
LOCAL RENT CONTROL IS BETTER

02:36:51.835 --> 02:36:54.471
POLICY- I INVITE YOU TO

02:36:54.538 --> 02:36:56.140
CONVINCE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS OF

02:36:56.206 --> 02:36:58.041
THAT I KNOW THAT THE LEADERSHIP

03:00:18.507 --> 03:00:21.076
MEASURE AND IT BEING THE WAY

03:00:21.143 --> 03:00:22.478

THIS. MADAM IN I GUESS THE GETS

03:00:56.946 --> 03:00:58.647

KNOW THAT THE BAY ARE TO THESE

03:01:04.286 --> 03:01:06.488
SOPHISTICATED CREDITOR IN THE

03:01:06.555 --> 03:01:07.957
FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE

03:01:08.023 --> 03:01:09.758
OPERATING IN THIS IN CALIFORNIA

03:01:09.825 --> 03:01:13.162
IN THE IN THE- IN THE- STATE N.

03:01:13.229 --> 03:01:15.464
THEY HAVE ALL THE OTHER TOOLS

03:01:15.531 --> 03:01:17.199
REMEDIES THAT THE CALIFORNIA

03:01:17.266 --> 03:01:19.235
LAW APPEALS TO THEM. AND WAGE

03:01:19.301 --> 03:01:21.670
GARNISHMENT LEVYING OF BANK

03:01:21.737 --> 03:01:24.640
ACCOUNTS THEN IN GETTING A

03:01:24.707 --> 03:01:26.709
JUDGMENT AND PLACING A LIEN ON

03:01:26.775 --> 03:01:30.646
THE PROPERTY- IT SEEMS TO ME

03:01:30.713 --> 03:01:32.414
THAT IT'S- UNFORTUNATE THAT

03:01:32.481 --> 03:01:34.516
THAT WERE OPENING UP THIS DOOR

03:01:34.583 --> 03:01:36.085
TO ALLOW THESE FOR SALES TO

03:01:36.151 --> 03:01:37.486
CONTINUE WITH THE MOST

03:01:37.553 --> 03:01:39.722
SOPHISTICATED CREDITORS. THAT

03:01:39.788 --> 03:01:41.690
DEBT THAT HOLD LARGEST AMOUNT

03:01:41.757 --> 03:01:43.092
OF DEAD IN THE STATE OF

03:01:43.158 --> 03:01:45.160
CALIFORNIA I'M WORRISOME ABOUT

03:01:45.227 --> 03:01:49.198
WELL IT'S NOT USE NOW. D.

03:01:49.265 --> 03:01:52.334
REMEDIES IN MY- OPINION WOULD

03:01:52.401 --> 03:01:54.470
BE ADEQUATE FOR THEM TO

03:01:54.536 --> 03:01:58.040
CONTINUE TO GO ABOUT OTHER THAN

03:01:58.107 --> 03:01:59.141
OPENING UP THE DOOR AND I'M

03:01:59.208 --> 03:02:01.577
WONDERING WHY. I MEAN I GUESS I

03:02:01.644 --> 03:02:02.811
CAN UNDERSTAND THE POLITICAL

03:02:02.878 --> 03:02:04.813
SIDE BUT ACADEMICALLY YOU KNOW

03:02:04.880 --> 03:02:05.948
AND THEN SECURITY IT IS AN

03:02:06.015 --> 03:02:07.383
UNSECURED DEBT THAT'S WHAT THEY

03:02:07.449 --> 03:02:09.084
WERE AND- THEY'RE ENTITLED TO

03:02:09.151 --> 03:02:12.388
THAT STATUS. REGARDLESS OF

03:02:12.454 --> 03:02:14.523
SEVEN THOUSAND SEVEN DOLLARS OR

03:02:14.590 --> 03:02:17.559
ORDERS SEVEN CENTS. SO DOES

03:02:17.626 --> 03:02:18.727
THAT MAKE SENSE THE CONCERN

03:02:18.794 --> 03:02:24.033
THAT I HAVE. THROUGH THE CHAIR

03:02:24.099 --> 03:02:25.134
YET THROUGH CHAIR TO A

03:02:25.200 --> 03:02:30.406
PROFESSOR AT KRISHNA KUMAR FEE.

03:02:30.472 --> 03:02:33.075
HI I THINK WE BROADLY AGREE

03:02:33.142 --> 03:02:34.943

OTHER SIDE WITH TO- YOU KNOW

03:02:40.616 --> 03:02:42.651
PROTECT CONSUMERS- TO THE

03:02:42.718 --> 03:02:43.886
DENTIST AND I WE THOUGHT

03:02:43.952 --> 03:02:45.721
POSSIBLE NOW AND WE LOOK AT THE

03:02:45.788 --> 03:02:47.356
BIGGEST CATEGORY DID THAT

03:02:47.423 --> 03:02:49.758
MEDICAL DEBT FOR EXAMPLE IS NOT

03:02:49.825 --> 03:02:50.292
GOING TO COME UNDER THAT.

03:02:50.359 --> 03:02:51.727
FINANCIAL INSTITUTION EXEMPTION

03:02:51.794 --> 03:02:53.529
BECAUSE THEY DON'T HOLD MEDICAL

03:02:53.595 --> 03:02:56.265
DEBT- STUDENT LOANS WHICH ARE

03:02:56.332 --> 03:02:58.200
LIKELY TO BE OR CAN BE AN ACT

03:02:58.267 --> 03:02:59.468
THAT THE SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND

MENTIONED- EXCLUDED FROM THAT

03:03:02.838 --> 03:03:05.040
EXEMPTION AND SO WHAT WE'RE

03:03:05.107 --> 03:03:06.709
LEFT WITH IS PERHAPS- CREDIT

03:03:06.775 --> 03:03:09.144
CARD DEBT OR OTHER CATEGORIES

03:03:09.211 --> 03:03:10.479
BUT IF YOU KIND OF LOOKED AT

03:03:10.546 --> 03:03:12.681
THE FEDERAL RESERVE- DATA ON

03:03:12.748 --> 03:03:14.183
WHAT THE CREDIT BALANCES THAT

PEOPLE HAVE. IT EXCEEDINGLY

03:03:16.418 --> 03:03:18.487
RARE FOR THERE TO BE SOMETHING

DOLLARS MEAN. THIS IS SAID THIS

03:05:29.852 --> 03:05:31.186
IS ON TOP OF THE- MMHM THE

03:05:31.253 --> 03:05:33.088
HOMESTEAD EXEMPTION WHICH- I

03:05:33.155 --> 03:05:34.490

PUT YOUR CORRECT OKAY. WELL I

03:05:36.658 --> 03:05:38.527
THINK WHAT I WAS. TRYING TO

03:05:38.594 --> 03:05:39.461
UNDERSTAND IS WHAT ABOUT

03:05:39.528 --> 03:05:41.230
RESTRUCTURED DEBT BECAUSE I

03:05:41.296 --> 03:05:43.198
THINK THE ROUTE IT SAYS HERE

03:05:43.265 --> 03:05:46.835
THAT ON A DEBT THAT WAS SECURED

03:05:46.902 --> 03:05:48.470
BY THE DEBTORS PRINCIPAL PLACE

03:05:48.537 --> 03:05:50.606
OF RESIDENCE AT THE TIME IT WAS

03:05:50.672 --> 03:05:54.409
INCURRED. SO WHAT HAPPENS. IN A

03:05:54.476 --> 03:05:55.944
SCENARIO WHERE THE DEBT IS

03:05:56.011 --> 03:05:57.913
RESTRUCTURED SO THAT IT WAS IN

03:05:57.980 --> 03:05:59.781
KURD IN ONE SCENARIO BUT

03:05:59.848 --> 03:06:01.850
RESTRUCTURED THEREAFTER DOES

03:06:01.917 --> 03:06:03.352
THAT CHANGE THE NATURE OF THIS

03:06:03.418 --> 03:06:04.987
THROUGH THE CHAIRED BY READING

03:06:05.053 --> 03:06:06.555
A SAID IT'S THE LATTER DAY IT

03:06:06.622 --> 03:06:09.024
IS IT'S AS IT MOVES FORWARD

03:06:09.091 --> 03:06:11.760
BECAUSE YOUR VALUE OF YOUR HOME

03:06:11.827 --> 03:06:13.228
WOULD GO UP. BUT THE PROFESSOR

03:06:13.295 --> 03:06:16.131
OR MISTER SAID I DISAGREE. LET

03:06:16.198 --> 03:06:17.599

FALL INTO ARREARS LATER IN TIME.

BUT THEN RESTRUCTURE THE DEBT

03:06:30.746 --> 03:06:33.448
IN ITS NOT ARE COLLATERALIZED

03:06:33.515 --> 03:06:36.552

03:07:21.396 --> 03:07:21.997
PARTICULAR SCENARIO THAT I

03:07:22.064 --> 03:07:25.500
UNDERSTAND CORRECTLY. SB FIRST

LOAN WAS SECURITIZED. UNDER OF

03:07:27.336 --> 03:07:30.405

THEY'RE REPLYING. SO THEY WOULD

03:07:40.082 --> 03:07:44.920
BE A GREAT HOPES ARE GOING.

03:07:44.987 --> 03:07:46.021
THAT THEY WOULD HAVE TO FOLLOW

03:07:46.088 --> 03:07:48.256
THE SECOND CONTRACT AND NOT THE

03:07:48.323 --> 03:07:50.025
UN SECURITIZED CONTRACT BECAUSE

CONTRACT GOT IT. IN MY WRITING

03:08:00.969 --> 03:08:03.338
BUT MY LAST POINT. I HAVE A

03:08:03.405 --> 03:08:06.541
SOFT SPOT ON THIS ISSUE. BUT

03:08:06.608 --> 03:08:09.144

CARDS IN PROPERTY TAX ARE

03:08:38.473 --> 03:08:40.275

STATEMENT OF TO SAY THE LEAST.

03:27:52.693 --> 03:27:53.994

NEVER BE UNDONE- AND THEY

03:28:34.802 --> 03:28:36.470
SHOULD NEVER HAPPEN IN THE

03:28:36.537 --> 03:28:40.074
FIRST PLACE SO IF WE NEED TO

NEVER HAVE HAPPENED AND NEVER

03:28:48.883 --> 03:28:51.418
BE ALLOWED TO HAPPEN AGAIN I

03:28:51.485 --> 03:28:52.920

THINK YOU SAID IT VERY WELL ON.

03:29:08.002 --> 03:29:10.537
THIS THINGS LIKE THIS ARE

03:29:10.604 --> 03:29:13.340
ABSOLUTELY UNCONSCIONABLE- AND

03:29:13.407 --> 03:29:16.243
I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS BUT

03:29:16.310 --> 03:29:18.379
MY CONCERN IS THAT WE ARE

03:29:18.445 --> 03:29:22.049
ISOLATING ONE INSTITUTION. WHEN

03:29:22.116 --> 03:29:24.018
WOULD IT NOT BE BETTER AS A

03:29:24.084 --> 03:29:26.820
MATTER OF POLICY. TO CHANGE THE

03:29:26.887 --> 03:29:28.923
STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS ISSUES

03:29:28.989 --> 03:29:33.994
MORE BROADLY. HAVE IT APPLIED.

03:29:34.061 --> 03:29:36.597
TO WHAT ALL SCHOOLS. AND THEN

03:29:36.664 --> 03:29:38.465
WE DEAL WITH S. C. BEFORE NOW

03:29:38.532 --> 03:29:40.401
WE'RE DEALING WITH UCLA BUT

03:29:40.467 --> 03:29:42.703
THIS KIND OF PIECEMEAL APPROACH

03:29:42.770 --> 03:29:45.806
FROM A POLICY STANDPOINT JUST

03:29:45.873 --> 03:29:47.775
CONCERNS ME THAT IT COULD BE.

03:29:47.841 --> 03:29:49.977
BETTER ADDRESSED IF THERE WERE

03:29:50.044 --> 03:29:51.645
IF THERE WERE REFORMS ACROSS

03:29:51.712 --> 03:29:55.082
THE BOARD IN TERMS OF SEXUAL

03:29:55.149 --> 03:29:57.418
IMITATIONS SO I'LL CERTAINLY BE

03:29:57.484 --> 03:30:00.554
SUPPORTING IT BUT- IF WE IF WE

03:30:00.621 --> 03:30:03.524
HEAR ANOTHER SCHOOL. WHETHER

03:30:03.590 --> 03:30:05.292
IT'S IN THE UC SYSTEM THE CSU

03:30:05.359 --> 03:30:07.895
SYSTEM OR A PRIVATE SYSTEM IF

03:30:07.962 --> 03:30:09.263
WE HEAR THAT A SITUATION LIKE

03:30:09.330 --> 03:30:10.397
THIS OCCUR AGAIN ARE WE JUST

03:30:10.464 --> 03:30:12.599
GONNA GO SCHOOL BY SCHOOL BY

03:30:12.666 --> 03:30:14.101
SCHOOL OVER THE COURSE OF THE

03:30:14.168 --> 03:30:15.903
YEARS I DON'T THINK THAT THAT'S

03:30:15.970 --> 03:30:17.538
MORE POLICY I THINK WE SHOULD

03:30:17.604 --> 03:30:21.241
BE EVALUATING- SUCH LIMITATIONS

03:30:21.308 --> 03:30:24.545
REFORM. THANK YOU I WILL NOTE

03:30:24.611 --> 03:30:26.146
THAT WE HAVE EXPANDED THE

03:30:26.213 --> 03:30:28.849
STATURE LIMITATIONS ON THESE.

03:30:28.916 --> 03:30:30.985
OFFENSES ARE GOING FORWARD I

03:30:31.051 --> 03:30:32.419
THINK WE DID THAT A FEW YEARS

03:30:32.486 --> 03:30:35.089
AGO TO TEN YEARS- WE'VE DONE IT

03:30:35.155 --> 03:30:36.123
WITH COURSE WE HAD THE

03:30:36.190 --> 03:30:37.858
SITUATION WITH THE CHURCH.

03:30:37.925 --> 03:30:40.861
CATHOLIC CHURCH AND- EXPANDED

03:30:40.928 --> 03:30:42.496
THAT STATUE LIMITATIONS I MEAN

03:30:42.563 --> 03:30:44.164
THE BOTTOM LINE THIS IS GOT TO

03:30:44.231 --> 03:30:46.233
STOP. THIS JUST CANNOT BE

03:30:46.300 --> 03:30:48.369
ALLOWED TO HAPPEN AND I THINK

03:30:48.435 --> 03:30:48.969
WE HAVE HERE IN THE STATE OF

03:30:49.036 --> 03:30:50.871
CALIFORNIA. A TAKEN A VERY

03:30:50.938 --> 03:30:53.841
STRONG POSITION ON THIS. AND IT

03:30:53.907 --> 03:30:56.910
IS MY HOPE. THAT THE MESSAGE IS

03:30:56.977 --> 03:30:58.512
OUT THERE YOU JUST CANNOT

03:30:58.579 --> 03:31:01.648
EXPLOIT PEOPLE LIKE THIS- AND I

03:31:01.715 --> 03:31:03.050
THINK THIS ADDRESSES BUT WE

03:31:03.117 --> 03:31:04.118
KNOW TO HAVE BEEN A LONG

03:31:04.184 --> 03:31:06.220
STANDING PROBLEM- AND IS AN

03:31:06.286 --> 03:31:08.389
APPROPRIATE RESOLUTION. AT THIS

03:31:08.455 --> 03:31:09.923
POINT IN TIME I HOPE WE DON'T

03:31:09.990 --> 03:31:11.792

RIGHT OF ACTION WHICH I BELIEVE
