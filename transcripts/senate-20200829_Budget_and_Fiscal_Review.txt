SIR IT IS OUR INTENTION TO- TAKE VOTES TODAY ON BUDGET BILL JUNIOR WHICH IS AB EIGHTY SIX. AND TO TAKE VOTES ON ITEMS THREE THROUGH TWELVE THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT ANY AT ANY OTHER COMMENT SUSTENANCE NIELSEN. WITH THAT WE'RE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND LET'S BEGIN WITH OUR FIRST BILL AB SIX RELATED TO THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE ON L. A. L. I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU'RE GOING TO PRESENT FIRST AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THE PLEASURE OF HEARING FROM OUR TWENTY GENERAL MR BECERRA- AND THEN FOLLOWED BY FINANCE IF THEY HAVE ANY COMMENTS LET'S GET STARTED WITH THE L. A. O. ON. AB. SIX MEETING I'M SURE SENATORS ANNUALLY WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE WE HAVE BEEN ASKED TO PROVIDE A BRIEF SUMMARY OF THIS BILL THE BILL HAS FOUR MAJOR PROVISIONS FIRST- IN ADDITION TO THE STATE'S UNFAIR COMPETITION LAW PLANS THIS BILL WOULD PERMIT CIVIL PENALTIES FOR VIOLATIONS OF THE STATE'S UNFAIR BUSINESS PRACTICES LAWS TO ALSO BE DEPOSITED INTO THE PUBLIC RIGHTS LAW ENFORCEMENT SPECIAL FUNDS FOR CONSUMER PROTECTION ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES. SECONDS THE BILL WOULD ALSO PROVIDE DOJ WITH UP TO SIXTEEN ADDITIONAL EXEMPT POSITIONS- THE WHICH WOULD BRING THEIR TOTAL TO THIRTY THREE. THIRD THE BILL WOULD AUTHORIZE DOJ TO USE ITS OWN AUTHORITY TO SEEK CIVIL PENALTIES FOR VIOLATIONS OF CERTAIN WATER POLLUTION LAWS INSTEAD OF ONLY BEING ABLE TO BRING SUIT UPON COMPLAINT BY THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE. FOURTH AND FINALLY- STATES ARE CURRENTLY IN THE PROCESS OF SEEKING AROUND TO TWENTY SIX POINT FOUR BILLION FROM CERTAIN OPIOID DISTRIBUTORS AND MANUFACTURERS. TO ADDRESS THE IMPACTS OF THE OPIOID CRISIS. AND SO THIS BILL IS INTENDED TO HELP FACILITATE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AND TURN INTO A STATEWIDE OPIOID SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS TO MAXIMIZE CALIFORNIA'S SHARE OF ANY SETTLEMENT REVENUES. IT WOULD ENCOURAGE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WHO FILED OPIOID LAWSUITS BEFORE AUGUST TWENTY FOURTH TO JOIN THE SETTLEMENTS AND ALLOWS THE ATTORNEY GENERAL TO RELEASE OR DISMISS ANY CLAIMS AFTER THAT DATE. ADDITIONALLY IT WOULD REQUIRE THAT THE STATE PORTION OF ANY SETTLEMENT MONIES- BETTER RECEIVED BE USED IN A MANNER CONSISTENT WITH THE FRAMEWORK OF THE SETTLEMENT AND WOULD ALSO BE SUBJECT TO LEGISLATIVE APPROPRIATION. THESE PROVISIONS WOULD ONLY GO INTO A FACT OF A STATE WIDE OPEN RATED CREMINS WAS ENTERED INTO AND WOULD BE REPEALED AS OF JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY THREE. WITHOUT WILL CONCLUDE OUR SUMMARY COMMENTS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ATTORNEY GENERAL BECERRA WELCOME SIR. BETTER CHAIR AND NO SENATORS THANK YOU VERY VERY MUCH FOR LETTING ME COME BY I KNOW IT'S BEEN A LONG DAY FOR EVERYONE AND SO I'LL KEEP MY REMARKS VERY BRIEF AND- TAKE ANY QUESTIONS FIRST- THE PRINCIPLE- REASON FOR AB SIX- IS THE OPIOIDS I SETTLEMENT THAT. A MONTH AGO I WOULD HAVE TOLD YOU THAT WE WORK- CONTINUING TO TRY BUT NO REAL SIGNS THAT WE WERE ON THE HORIZON OF SUCCESS THERE ARE THIRTY FIVE HUNDRED LAWSUITS BY GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES STATES LOCAL GOVERNMENTS COUNTIES AND CITIES TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS AND THE TERRITORIES WHO ARE SUING ANY NUMBER OF DEFENDANTS- DEALING WITH OPIOIDS MANUFACTURERS DISTRIBUTORS PHARMACIST. WE ARE ON THE CUSP OF A SETTLEMENT WITH A NUMBER OF THOSE MAJOR- DEFENDANTS THAT- ABOUT TWO WEEKS AGO WE SUBMITTED A DEMAND AND TO THEM AND WE RECEIVED A COUNTER WHICH WAS. I THINK A LOT OF US A LEGITIMATE SERIOUS COUNTER WHICH GIVES OF THE US THE PROSPECT OF SETTLING. AND HERE'S THE IMPORTANT PART. FOR US TO SETTLE THIRTY FIVE HUNDRED LAWSUITS AND TO SETTLE THE FIFTY FOR THE FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES WHO HAVE SET UP FILE LAWSUITS THE TWENTY FIVE OR THE TWENTY SIX MAJOR CITIES WILL FILE LAWSUITS IN CALIFORNIA. WE OUGHT TO COME TOGETHER BECAUSE THE ONLY WAY THESE SETTLEMENTS WORK IS IF THE DEFENDANTS AS A RESULT OF SETTLING CLAIMS HAVE WHAT THEY CALL GLOBAL PEACE THEY DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT BEING BLINDSIDED BY LAWSUIT. SO AB FIVE BECOMES IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT CARRIES FORWARD- A PROVISION IT'S ABOUT FOUR PARAGRAPHS THAT THE MAIN PARTS OF THE AB SIX THAT OCCURRED LATE TO OPIATES THAT ARE IMPORTANT. ONE IT SAYS THAT IF THERE IS A SETTLEMENT. IT HAS TO CONTINUE TO TERM IN THERE THAT SAYS THAT MOVING FORWARD NO OTHER JURISDICTIONS IN THE STATE WILL BE FILING NEW CLAIMS BECAUSE IT WOULD MAKE IT POSSIBLE T. CLOSE THE DEAL IF DEFENDANTS ARE STILL SEEN NEW CLAIM BEING FILED AGAINST IMPACT THEIR PEACE PLAN SIDE. SECONDLY IT ALSO SAYS THAT NOTHING TAKES EFFECT UNTIL SETTLEMENT IS AN ACTIVE AND THE SETTLEMENT AND THE TERMS OF THE SETTLEMENT WILL DRIVE HOW THIS IS. HOW THE- ANY RESOURCES ARE DISTRIBUTED THROUGHOUT THE STATE TO THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND TO THAT END TO THE STATE GOVERNMENT AND SO I HOPE THAT- ALONG WITH THE OTHER IMPORT PROVISIONS. THAT THE CENTERS WILL RECOGNIZE WE HAVE A CHANCE ACTUALLY THREE. WHAT HAS BEEN A- DECADES LONG PROBLEM WITH OPIOIDS AND NOW PROVIDE RELIEF AT A TIME QUITE HONESTLY WHERE I THINK MOST LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND THE STATE ARE STRAPPED TRYING TO PROVIDE. DECENT HEALTHCARE TO A LOT OF CALIFORNIA SO LET ME STOP THERE HE QUESTIONS ON OPIOIDS OR ANYTHING ELSE YOU'D LIKE TO DISCUSS. THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER TWENTY GENERAL LIVES HERE IF THE PROBLEM FINANCES HAS ANY COMMENTS BEFORE OPENING UP TO MEMBER QUESTIONS FINANCE. AMADOR SENIOR APARTMENT OF FINANCE SO WE DON'T HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENTS ON THIS BILL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER DORSEY- QUESTIONS MEMBERS OF THE- IF YOU LET US KNOW HERE JEFF YOUR QUESTION TO THE L. A. O. OR THE ATTORNEY GENERAL SENATOR NIELSEN I THANK YOU SIR. ATTORNEY GENERAL BECERRA QUESTION. YES AFTER GENERAL THE CITY'S AND COUNTIES VOICED SOME STRONG OPPOSITION AND THEY ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE IMPACT OF THIS ON DOWN. ARE-THOSE CONCERNS GOING TO BE ADDRESSED AS WE PROCEED HERE. EIGHT CENTER YES SIR AND- I JUST GOT OFF A CALL WITH US THE SECOND A NUMBER OF THE COUNTY REPRESENTATIVES- THEIR CONCERN WAS THAT THEY WANTED TO MAKE SURE THEY HAD A SEAT AT THE TABLE AND ABSOLUTELY THEIR RIGHT. AND THAT WILL BE GUARANTEED THROUGH THE SETTLEMENT ITSELF AND WHAT I CAN TELL YOU SENATORS AT IF YOU LOOK AT THE PROVISIONS IN EIGHTY SIX THAT RELATE TO THE OPIOIDS SETTLEMENT. AS I SAID ABOUT FOUR PARAGRAPHS THAT ARE OPERATIVE IT'S VERY NARROW AND WHAT IT SAYS IT SIMPLY SAYS LET'S GET GOING LET'S MAKE SURE THAT WE TRY TO GET EVERYBODY ON BOARD BECAUSE THE WAY THE SETTLEMENTS WORK. THE DEFENDANTS PROFFER RESOURCES TO SETTLE THE CLAIMS THEY WILL NOT LET GO OF RESOURCES UNTIL THE CLAIMS ARE RELEASED. THE FEWER CLAIMS THAT ARE BASED THE LESS MONEY THAT THEY WILL- I LOOK AT THE RESOURCES THAT THEY'LL SEND TO US SO FOR US TO GET THE 100% SHARE THAT. THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA GOVERNMENT SHOULD RECEIVE UNDER THE OVERALL SETTLEMENT WE HAVE TO BE A CLOSE THE DOOR ON NEW LITIGATION FOR THESE DEFENDANTS AND SO THIS BILL SIMPLY. SAYS MOVING FORWARD. NO MORE NUKES CAN BE FILED. ALL THIS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THE COUNTIES IN THE CITIES. THAT HAVE ALREADY FILED THEIR CLAIMS BEFORE AUGUST TWENTY FOURTH TWENTY TWENTY. ALL THOSE JURISDICTIONS GET TO DECIDE DO THEY WANT TO CONTINUE WITH THEIR LITIGATION WHAT DO THEY WANT TO JOIN THIS SETTLEMENT. THAT WILL BE UP TO THEM THEY WILL NOT BE FORCED TO CHOOSE. BUT THE JURISDICTIONS THAT HAVE NOT YET FILED. THEY WILL NOT BE ABLE TO WAIT. NOW AND SAY WAIT NOW WE WANT TO FIVE. THEY WILL GET TO PARTICIPATE FULLY THEY'RE ENTITLED TO THEIR FULL SHARE IN THE SETTLEMENT. BUT WE'RE TRYING TO LOCK THE DOOR SO WE CAN NOW NAIL THE SENATE DOWN AND GET IT MOVING. SO WE CAN ALL WITH A CALIFORNIA LOCAL GOVERNMENTS OF THE STATE GET OUR FAIR SHARE. THEN THE- MISTER TURNER GENERAL AS FAR AS THE ON THE APPORTIONMENT THERE FROM OF THE QUOTE SETTLEMENT- HOW ARE EACH COUNTY HELP WITH DETERMINE WHAT THEIR SHARES WILL BE. AND THE EXTRA OPERATIVE EXPRESSION CENTER YOU GET RIGHT ON IT SO. THERE IS NO YET THAT NO SETTLEMENT TODAY THERE ARE TERMS THAT ARE BEING NEGOTIATED BUT WHAT I CAN TELL YOU IS THE OUTLINES OF THE DEAL- PRETTY MUCH FIXED BECAUSE SOME OF THAT IS DONE BY THE PLAINTIFFS THE GOVERNMENTS THAT ARE SUING. AND GENERALLY SPEAKING THE OVERALL APPROACH WILL BE THAT WE WILL TAKE THE PART OF RESOURCES THAT THESE DEFENDANTS COLLECTIVELY WILL PROVIDE. AND IT WILL BE DISTRIBUTED 70% OF IT WILL GO DIRECTLY TO OPIOIDS ABATEMENT DEAL WITH ADDICTION TO DEAL WITH- PREVENTION THE THINGS THAT COMMUNITIES NEED AT HOME FOR THEIR FAMILIES FOR THEIR COMMUNITIES. 15% OF THE POT WILL BE RESERVED EXCLUSIVELY TO THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO CONTINUE TO DO THE OPIOIDS WORK THE WAY THEY THINK THEY CAN SUPPLEMENT WHAT IS THE 70% POT. AND THEN THE OTHER 50% POT IS LEFT FOR THE STATE GOVERNMENT ALSO SUPPLEMENT THE WORK THAT'S BEING DONE THROUGHOUT THE STATE ON OPIOIDS FIFTEEN SEVENTY FIFTEEN. STATE DOESN'T HAVE ANY SAY AS TO WHAT HAPPENS TO THE- LOCAL SHARE LOCALS DON'T HAVE A SAY IN WHAT HAPPENS TO THE STATE SHARE EVERYONE IN THE SETTLEMENT STATE AND LOCALS WILL PARTICIPATE IN DETERMINING HOW THE SEVENTY PERCENT. IS ALLOCATED IF THEY DON'T AGREE THE MONEY SITS IN A LOCAL IN A STATE OF CALIFORNIA POT NOT IN ARE NOT IN YOUR- BUDGET I'M SORRY NINETY YOUR GENERAL FUND IT SITS IN A- SETTLEMENT POT. UNTIL ALL THE JURISDICTIONS LOCAL AND STATE AND DETERMINE HOW THAT MONEY WILL BE DISTRIBUTED. THANK YOU ONE LAST QUESTION. THIS ALSO EXTENDS YOUR AUTHORITY GREATLY IN A SORT OF UNPRECEDENTED WAY WERE. AGENCIES AND ENTITIES CAN INITIATE LITIGATION BUT YOU SEPARATELY AND INDEPENDENTLY CANTU. WHY WHY IS THAT NECESSARY. ARE WE TALKING ABOUT THE FISHING GAME PROVISION HERE THAT IS RIGHT. SIR OCCASION WHILE I. SENATE WHAT THAT'S CLEAN UP LANGUAGE OR TRY TO CLARIFY REMEMBER UNDER THE COST. THAT OF JUSTICE THE ATTORNEY HAS INDEPENDENT AUTHORITY. TO INITIATE ACTIONS TO DEFEND THE PEOPLE WITH THE RESOURCES AND THE VALUES OF THE STATE AND WE HAD A RETURN CASE RECENTLY WHERE. BECAUSE WE WORK CLOSELY WITH FISH AND WILDLIFE THEY ARE STATE LIENT I AM THE ATTORNEY FOR THE FISH AND WILDLIFE WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE FOLLOW OUR FIDUCIARY DUTY OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO. PROTECT THE INTERESTS OF OUR CLIENTS EVEN THOUGH WE HAVE AN INDEPENDENT AUTHORITY TO SUE. WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE WE'RE ABIDING BY OUR FIDUCIARY RESPONSIBILITY TO OUR STATE CLIENT. SO THAT THERE WON'T BE ANY CONFLICT BETWEEN WHAT I CAN DO INDEPENDENTLY AND WHAT I MUST DO AS COUNSEL FOR BY STATE AGENCY CLIENT. WE ALWAYS MAKE AN EFFORT TO DEFER TO OUR STATE AGENCY CLIENT AND WHAT WE DO. BUT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE IT'S CLEAR THAT IF THERE IS A NEED TO DIFFERENTIATE. THAT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE DOES NOT LOSE ITS JURISDICTION. TO INITIATE ACTIONS THAT THE CONSTITUTION GIVES US SO TO AVOID. WORK WE WERE TRYING TO GET THIS CLEAN UP LANGUAGE INTO THE BILL THAT WAS THE ACTUAL BASIN BILL AB SIX. BEFORE IT CAN BE. IN CLEAR THAT UP I DON'T BEACHWOOD SETTLEMENT COULD RUN AND WE DON'T WANT TO MISS THE TRAIN BECAUSE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE CALIFORNIA BEING THE LARGEST STATE. GETS INTO THAT SETTLEMENT. AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE- MISTER LETTING OTHER STATES B. AS TO THE POT. WELL EXCUSE ME I DO UNDERSTAND THE AUTHORITIES OF THE. ATTORNEY GENERAL REPRESENTING AGENCIES. BUT AS A- LOOK AT HOW HAVE BEEN DONE HISTORICALLY. THIS IS A DEPARTURE. BECAUSE YOU ARE NOW IT KNOWLEDGE IN A SEPARATE AND INDEPENDENT TRACK. AND IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT YOU'RE GOING TO. INVITE YOUR OWN ACTION. AND THAT'S THE TICKET. AND TO ME I DON'T THINK THAT'S GOOD GOVERNMENT IT'S A GREAT EXPANSION OF THE AUTHORITIES OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL I WOULD LOOK AT IT IN THAT MANNER YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO CONVINCE ME ON THIS AND OTHER WORDS MISTER TURNER GENERAL. LET ME LET ME TRY THE OTHER ROUTE HERE- CENTER BECAUSE YOU PROBABLY GOT A GOOD POINT HE WOULD NOT BE CONSISTENT IN IT WOULDN'T MAKE SENSE FOR THE ATTORNEY FOR A STATE AGENCY TO BE DOING SOMETHING OTHER THAN WHAT THE STATE AGENCY SETS. AND THAT'S WHERE WE HAVE TO REALLY- ABIDE BY OUR FIDUCIARY RESPONSIBILITY AS WE- PROTECT THE INTERESTS OF OUR CLIENTS AND SO I DON'T THINK YOU'VE EVER YOU COULD PROBABLY EVER BRING UP THE CASE IN YOUR MEMORY WHERE YOU'VE SEEN THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE BE AT ODDS WITH THE STATE AGENCY CLIENT- IN COURT. AND SO WHAT WE DON'T EXPECT THAT TO HAPPEN BUT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE IT'S CLEAR THAT. IF OUR STATE AGENCY CLIENT FOR EXAMPLE IS IT GOING TO GET INVOLVED IN A PARTICULAR MATTER. THAT IT DOESN'T- PRECLUDED ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE FROM BEING ABLE TO TAKE ACTION TO INITIATE ACTION. IF OUR EIGHT STAGES. FINE IS NOT A VOTERS. AND WE DON'T WANT IT TO BE PERCEIVED THAT NO YOU CAN'T DO THAT BECAUSE YOU STAGE IT AGENCY CLIENT. IS A DAY IN THAT ACTUALLY SO LET E EXPLAIN. THOUGH THERE THE PUT THAT. EXPLANATION COULD POINT ON WHAT I JUST SAID. I AM A THE STATE PROSECUTOR. FOR THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. WE ALSO HAVE FIFTY EIGHT OTHER LOCAL PROSECUTORS THE DA'S IN OUR FIFTY ACCOUNTS. THE SAME STATUTE THAT WE'RE REFERRING TO THAT WE'RE TRYING TO CLEAN UP PROVIDES TO THOSE FIFTY EIGHT DISTRICT ATTORNEYS. THE SAME POWERS THAT I'M TELLING YOU THAT WE'RE TRYING TO CLARIFY THAT THE AG AT WHICH IS TO TAKE INDEPENDENT ACTION REGARDLESS OF WHAT THE STATE AGENCY FISH AND WILDLIFE SAYS AND SO IT WOULD BE INCONGRUOUS. TO SAY THAT ANYONE OF THE FIFTY EIGHT DISTRICT ATTORNEYS HAVE THE INDEPENDENT AUTHORITY TO TAKE ACTION REGARDLESS OF WHAT THIS- THE STATE AGENCY FISH AND WILDLIFE SAYS. AND THE- ATTORNEY GENERAL SUPERVISORS FIFTY EIGHT DISTRICT ATTORNEYS WOULD NOT SO WHAT WE'RE SIMPLY TRYING TO DO IS CLARIFY THAT. THE WAY THIS STATE HAS TO WORK AGP REPRESENTING ALL STATE AGENCIES SHOULD NOT UNDERMINE THE INDEPENDENT AUTHORITY THAT THE CONSTITUTION GIVES. TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE BUT AGAIN TO YOUR POINT IS I THINK YOU'RE ACTUALLY RIGHT IT WOULD BE INCONGRUOUS DEFINED. THE DEPARTMENT JUSTICE ACTING AGAINST THE INTERESTS OF ONE OF ITS STATE AGENTS CLIENTS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR EXPLANATION ATTORNEY GENERAL CONSIDER ME REMAINING A SKEPTICAL THANK YOU FOR YOUR ANSWER. YOUR QUESTIONS. THANK YOU SENATOR NELSON ANY OTHER MEMBERS. THAT HAVE QUESTIONS FOR THE COMING YEAR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM MADAM. CHAIR AND THANK YOU TO THE AGE FOR THAT X. AYE AYE AYE. AND I AND I APOLOGIZE WE'VE BEEN PLAYING PHONE TAG- TODAY IT TO REALLY ADDRESS THIS EXACT ISSUE THAT WAS BROUGHT UP BY- BY THE GOOD SENATOR NIELSEN AYE I AM I HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THIS AS WELL AND PART OF THE CHALLENGES. ANY TIME YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT WATER. IN RURAL CALIFORNIA. IT IS A SUBJECT OF GREAT CONCERN MOSTLY BECAUSE THERE'S NOT ENOUGH AND THAT THAT EXISTS THERE'S ONE BIG DEBATE OVER WHETHER WERE USING TOO MUCH WHETHER- MORE SHOULD BE USED FOR THE ENVIRONMENT AS OPPOSED FOR FARMING AND- AND AS YOU KNOW IT'S BEEN A SUBJECT OF LITIGATION OVER THE OVER THE YEARS AND PART OF THE CHALLENGE WITH THE LANGUAGE. AS IT IS IN THIS BUDGET TRAILER BILL. AND IT WELL FIRST OF ALL LET ME JUST SAY TO PUT A. POINT OPIOID SETTLEMENT IN WITH THE BILL THAT'S GOING TO SIGNIFICANTLY I BELIEVE IMPACT RURAL CALIFORNIA AND- CREATES PARANOIA IN THE WATER ROSE I GET WHAT YOU'RE WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IN REGARDS YOU TAKE POSITION- AGAINST- YOUR CLIENTS AND I BELIEVE IT AND I KNOW YOU AND I KNOW THAT THAT. WOULD BE THE WAY YOU WOULD HANDLE IT. BUT YOU WON'T BE THE AG FOREVER AND SO I GET CONCERNED ABOUT HOW WE'RE SETTING UP THE SYSTEM AND RIGHT NOW IT REQUIRES. VISION AND MYLIFE TO- ACTUALLY INSTITUTED DO AN INVESTIGATION- AND ANY AS YOU SAID YOU CAN DO IT SEPARATELY BUT UT IT REALLY IS. IS THROUGH THE AT THE A GS SEVEN OF THE FISH AND WILDLIFE. I'M A AND THERE THERE'S GREAT CONSTERNATION ABOUT WHAT WE'RE WHAT WE'RE REALLY DOING HERE AND WHETHER IT'S A GREAT EXPANSION OF THE AUTHOROF YOUR OFFICE TO GO INTO. AN AREA WHERE- THERE MAY BE A CONFLICT IN TERMS OF HOW- AND HOW THE SITUATION OCCURRED IN AND SOME OF THE BIGGER PICTURES WHICH IS ARE WE- ARE WE REALLY RESTRICTING. FLOWS AND IS THIS A SITUATION THAT- THAT REQUIRES THE AG TO COME AND SO I JUST I HAVE GREAT CONCERNS ABOUT PUTTING THESE TWO TOGETHER NUMBER ONE AND I'VE HEARD. MY PHONE HAS BLOWN UP OVER THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE BECAUSE- BECAUSE IT IS CREATING GREAT ANXIETY IN ROCK CALIFORNIA AND SO I JUST WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW THAT I'M NOT SURE WE HAVE HI. I'M NOT SURE I AGREE WITH THAT THE- THE ANALYSIS THAT IT'S AN EXPANSION THAT IT'S NOT AN EXPANSION THAT IS IT JUST CLARIFYING AND SO THAT'S THAT. I GUESS. THAT'S MY CONCERN. SENATOR EFFECTIVE AT IF I COULD HAVE QUICKLY TRY TO REACH. OR YES. YEAH SO CENTER THANK YOU FOR THE THAT THE COMMON. THE REASON THIS CAME UP. BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THAT THE PHARMACY JUST AS WE HAVE THAT IN A MINUTE FORTY AND WE WOULD EXERCISE IT IF NECESSARY BUT WHAT WE WOULD DO IS TRY TO EXERCISE AND WHEN WE HAVE A STATE AGENCY.THAT IS INVOLVED AND MAYBE TAKING A PARTICULAR POSITION BECAUSE AGAIN IT WOULD BE A VIOLATION OF OUR OF OUR FIDUCIARY RESPONSIBILITY WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS IF THAT AGENCY HADN'T SPOKEN OR IS. STANDING DOWN. WE DON'T WANT THE IMPRESSION TO BE THAT. FIFTY EIGHT D. A.'S. CAN GO AHEAD AND TAKE ACTION INDEPENDENTLY REGARDLESS EVEN IF THE- FISHING BY LIKE DECIDED TO WALK INTO THIS. BUT THE STATE EIGHTY EIGHT G. WHO REPRESENTS THIS ALL OF THE OTHER PEOPLE CALIFORNIA. AND ALL OF ITS RESOURCES- WHILE EACH D. A. CAN ONLY REPRESENT THOSE IN HIS- COUNTY. CAT AND SO THAT WOULD BE AN INCONSISTENCY AND WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS AVOID. THE LAW HAVING THESE INCONSISTENCIES BECAUSE A CASE WAS PRODUCT WHERE THERE WAS NOT A AN ISSUE BECAUSE WE REPRESENTED. THE DEPARTMENT- AND THERE WAS NO CONFLICT BUT THE QUESTION AROSE. HOW IS IT THAT DJS CAN GO AHEAD AND ACT INDEPENDENTLY BUT THE SUPERVISOR. OF THE STATE'S PROSECUTOR CAN'T DO WITH FIFTY PROSECUTORS CAN DO UNDER THE SAME LAW AND SO WE'RE WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS AVOID THERE BEING. A AN INCONSISTENCY AND THAT'S WHY AS I SAID IT'S REALLY A CLEAN UP LIKE WE BELIEVE WE HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO DO THIS- BUT WHY HAVE IT BE CLOUDED BY. THIS SENSE THAT IT'S NOT QUITE CLEAR AND ONE FINAL CLARIFICATION CENTER BOB THIS. A LIFE AB SIX FOR RELATE OPIOIDS IS NOT A SETTLEMENT I WANT TO MAKE SURE IT'S CLEAR WE DON'T YET HAVE A DEAL. WHAT WE HAVE IS NEGOTIATIONS WHERE WE MADE IT DEMAND AS THE PLAINTIFF GOVERNMENTS. ARE TO THE DEFENDANT- MANUFACTURERS AND DISTRIBUTORS. AND WE BELIEVE WE'RE NOW ON THE CUSP OF GETTING A SETTLEMENT. AND THIS ALLOWS US TO TRY TO MOVE THAT DEAL FORTY IN A WAY THAT LETS CALIFORNIA START TO CLAIM. THE RESOURCES THAT WOULD BE PART OF THAT SETTLEMENT THAT WOULD BE ENTITLED. TO OUR STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. WELL I'M HAVING HEARD THAT I DO APPRECIATE THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN HAVING UP A SETTLEMENT AND WORKING TOWARDS IT WHY DO YOU NEED TO THIRTY AT THIS PARTICULAR POINT TO DO IT. NUMBER ONE AND NUMBER TWO IS- THE LETTERS THAT I RECEIVED IN OPPOSITION FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENT ARE CONCERNED THAT. THAT THEY WILL NOT RECEIVE COMPENSATION FOR THEIR ATTORNEYS FEES IT THEY'VE EXPANDED UP TO THIS POINT- MY FROM MY UNDERSTANDING FROM WHAT YOU SAID IS IT SOUNDS LIKE THAT THERE WOULD THAT THERE WOULD BE A PER. FOR EXPENSES THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN PAID BUT IF YOU COULD ANSWER THAT FOR ME PLEASE THAT WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL. YES THE- THE NEED IS BASED ON THE FACT THAT. THE DEFENDANTS HAVE THE WAY THIS WILL WORK IS THAT. THE MORE THE DEFENDANTS HAVE ASSURANCE THAT THEY WILL NOT FACE LAWSUIT IN THE FUTURE. FROM THESE PLAINTIFF GOVERNMENT SINCE. WHETHER IT'S THE STATE'S. THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS COUNTIES CITIES WHETHER IT'S THE- TERRITORY GOVERNMENT'S OR WHETHER IT'S THE TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS. THE MORE THAT THEY HAVE THAT ASSURANCE THAT THERE WILL NOT WILL NOT BE A LAWSUIT AGAINST THEM B. AS A RESULT OF THE SENATE THE MORE THEY WILL LET GO THE RESOURCES THAT THEY ARE OFFERING TO SETTLE THE CASE. BUT LESS. ASSURANCE THEY HAVE. BECAUSE ARE NOW RELEASE FOR THEIR NOT X. BY DIFFERENT GOVERNMENTS. THE LESS MONEY THAT. THE STATE AND ITS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WILL RECEIVE FROM THE POT SO ESSENTIALLY. OUR OUR STATE OUR CITIES ARE COUNTIES AND THE STATE. WILL BE HELD HOSTAGE. BY ANY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THAT HAVE NOT YET SUIT. BUT WHO MAY WANT US TO INTO THE FUTURE AND THE DEFENDANTS WILL SAY. WE HAVE TO FACE THE PROSPECT OF NEW COUNTIES AND CITIES TRYING TO SUE IN CALIFORNIA AND THEREFORE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO HOLD BACK SOME OF THE CITY AND COUNTY MONEY AND THE STATE MONEY. BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN AND WE DON'T WANT TO TAKE THAT RISK THAT WE LAID OUT ALL THIS MONEY AND WE STILL END UP WITH LAWSUITS AGAINST US SO WE HAVE TO TRY TO EQUAL LIBERALIZED EQ. GET IN A GLITTERING HERE WHERE. ARE THE DEFENDANTS YET THE ISSUE OF. SIXTEEN DISTINGUISHING AGAINST THEM AND WE EVEN GET THE RESOURCES THAT ARE BEING COMMITTED IN THE SUMMIT SO WE CAN ADDRESS THE OPIOID CRISIS AND SO THIS LEGISLATION IS SOMETHING SUPPOSED JUST FOUR PARAGRAPHS AND YOU CAN I CAN REDO THE PARAGRAPH THAT SPEAKS TO IT. IT'S VERY SIMPLE JUST AS THIS. AUGUST TWENTY FOURTH TWENTY TWENTY. IF YOU HAVE FILED. A LAWSUIT ALREADY. YEAH COUNTY OR CITY OR STATE. YOU CAN DECIDE. IF YOU WANT TO PARTICIPATE IN THE SETTLEMENT OR NOT AND IF YOU DON'T WANT TO YOU CAN CONTINUE WITH YOUR LAWSUIT MOM FOR WE CAN'T STOP THAT THIS BUDGET LEGISLATION DOESN'T BOB BUT IF YOU HAVEN'T ALREADY FILED A LAWSUIT HAVING MADE A CLAIM OF LEGAL CLAIMS AGAINST. THESE PARTICULAR DEFENDANTS. YOU CAN'T. IF THIS BILL PASSES AND THERE'S A SETTLEMENT THAT'S RICH AND THE SETTLEMENT HAS TO BE REACHED JUST JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE THE BILL DOESN'T WORK AT THE AT TO GET THE SETTLEMENT IN PLACE. YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO FILE A NEW LAWSUIT. BECAUSE THAT WOULD CREATE THE UNCERTAINTY FOR THE DEFENDANTS THAT WOULD HOLE CAUSED THEM TO HOLD BACK THE MONEY. AND SO THIS LEGISLATION IF IT BECOMES LAW LET'S JUST QUICKLY RESOLVE CASES THAT ARE OUT THERE THIRTY FIVE HUNDRED LAWSUITS ALREADY. FILED MANY MORE THAT COULD BE FILED BY OTHER COUNTIES AND CITIES THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. AND SO WHAT THIS DOES IS FOR THOSE WHO HAVEN'T ALREADY FILED IT SAYS. YOU WON'T BE ARE FOUND THE FUTURE YOU DIDN'T TAKE THE TIME TO DO IT. BUT YOU WILL GET TO PARTICIPATE FULLY IN THE SETTLEMENT AND GET YOUR FAIR SHARE. OUT OF. THE SETTLEMENT POT IN YOUR JURISDICTION. THANK YOU. THANK YOU WILL GO NEXT TO A SENATOR BELL FOLLOWED BY SENATOR MORLOCK. I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THOSE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA THEY'VE BEEN HARMED DIRECTLY. BY THE OPIOID AND DRUG ABUSE CRISIS AND AS- MOST OF YOU KNOW AND- MY CAREER IN THE LEGISLATURE. HAVE BEEN THE ONE TO FORM THE ALCOHOL AND DRUG ABUSE- SELECT COMMITTEE IN THE ASSEMBLY. AND THEN- THE SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE- WE'VE BEEN. WORKING ON THIS ISSUE- FOR SOME TIME SO MY PERSPECTIVE IS. THAT DOES IT HAVE BEEN HARMED IN CALIFORNIA ONLY 10% OF THEM ACTUALLY RECEIVE. SERVICES NECESSARY THAT MEANS AND 90% DO NOT RECEIVE SERVICES SO THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE A SETTLEMENT. IS SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE BENEFICIAL I THINK TO A LOT OF PEOPLE IF IT WAS DONE RIGHT THAT'S THE POINT I'M GOING TO MAKE SURE. FOR MANY. DECADES ACTUALLY. THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THE REALIGNMENT. THROUGH ELIMINATING THEIR ALCOHOL AND DRUG ABUSE DEPARTMENT IN TWENTY THIRTEEN- THROUGH- LEGISLATION. HAS BASICALLY SAID THAT THE COUNTIES NOT THE STATE GOVERNMENT. ARE THE MAIN RESPONSIBLE PARTY FOR PROVIDING SERVICES. TO PEOPLE AFFLICTED WITH SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND NEEDHAM'S NEED OF SERVICES SO THAT WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE EMERGENCY ROOM WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE CLINICS WE TALK ABOUT THE DRUG ABUSE PROGRAMS. DO WE TALK ABOUT THE COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS A LOT OF THOSE ORGANIZATIONS. OUR FUNDED COORDINATED BY THE COUNTIES SO WHAT I'M SAYING IS THE COUNTIES HAVE. A MUCH GREATER UNDERSTANDING OF THE AFFLICTION. THAT THIS SETTLEMENT ENTAILS SO MY QUESTION TO ATTORNEY GENERAL IS GIVEN THE FACT THAT THE STATE HAS. IN SOME CASES NOT. BEEN VERY ASSERTIVE AND DEALING WITH THE OPIOID CRISIS. WHY SHOULD THE COUNTY SB. NOT CONSIDERED EQUAL PARTNERS AT LEAST AND DEVELOPMENT OF A SETTLEMENT. AND WHEN I HEARD THE SETTLEMENT SPLIT I WAS SURPRISED BECAUSE I THINK THAT THE COUNTIES. ARE THE ONES THAT ARE PROVIDING. THE ACTUAL SERVICE TO PEOPLE I REMEMBER MYSELF AS A COUNTY SUPERVISOR FOR TWELVE YEARS BEEN THREATENED WITH BEING ARRESTED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WHEN WE ESTABLISH A NEEDLE EXCHANGE PROGRAM. THEY THREATENED TO ARREST US IMPORTANCE IS JAIL. AND WE SAID WELL WE HAVE THE JAIL IF THE COUNTY SO YOU'RE NOT TO BE PUT IN US IN OUR JAILS SO. THEY WEREN'T ALLOWED TO DO THAT BUT I LIKE TO KNOW WHY THE COUNTY'S. CARE BE EQUAL PARTNERS. WITNESSES TURNING GENERAL AND DISCUSSION OF THE SETTLEMENT. AND THE DISTRIBUTION OF FINDING IT AS POINTED OUT. IS VERY IMPORTANT WHY CAN'T THE COUNTIES HAVE DIRECT. DIRECT SOURCES OF FUNDING COMING FROM THE SETTLEMENT RATHER THAN HAVE TO GO THROUGH SOME STATE GOVERNMENT PROCESS. AND THOSE ARE MY QUESTIONS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. THANK VERY MUCH CENTER BELL MISTER TURNER GENERAL. SKINNER SEVERAL THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTIONS- SO YOU WERE OR WHERE THOSE QUESTIONS HAVE BEEN RAISED DURING THE SETTLEMENT NEGOTIATIONS AND THAT'S WHY THE SETTLEMENT IT'S- WILL BE BASED ON THE ACTIONS BY ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS TO PLAY GOVERNMENT'S. WHO ARE PART OF THE SETTLEMENT IF YOU ARE A MEMBER OF THE SETTLEMENT CLASS YOU GET TO PARTICIPATE AND EACH STATE WITH ITS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WILL DECIDE FOR THEMSELVES HOW THEY WISH TO HAVE THOSE ALLOCATIONS MADE FOR THE MITIGATION AND ABATEMENT PROGRAMS. TO ADDRESS- THE OPIOID ADDICTION AND THE AT THE CRISIS AND SO IN CALIFORNIA AND THIS IS WHAT I MENTIONED TO THE COUNTY REPRESENTATIVES THAT I WAS ON THE PHONE WITH A RIGHT BEFORE WE GOT ON FOR THIS. BUDGET SESSION- AS I MENTIONED WE'RE GONNA BE SITTING DOWN WITH THEM THEY ARE ALL REPRESENTED BY COUNSEL AND WILL BE SITTING DOWN WITH THEM BECAUSE WE HAVE TO COME UP WITH A WEIGHT OF METHODOLOGY FOR THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE DOLLARS THAT EVERYONE AGREES TO. IF WE CANNOT SO ESSENTIALLY EVERYONE HAS A VETO POWER IF WE CAN'T COME UP WITH A SOLUTION THE STATE CAN'T JUST IMPOSE ONE THE% MONEY IS HELD BY THE SETTLEMENT ADMINISTRATOR IN A POT NOT THE GENERAL FUND OF THE STATE IN A SETTLEMENT POT. AND UNTIL THE PLAYERS IN THAT STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IN THE STATE COME TO TERMS THAT MONEY IS HELD IN THAT POT THE 70% THE 15% THAT THE. LOCAL GOVERNMENTS GET THEY WILL GET DIRECTLY. IT DECIDE HOW DO YOU THE STATE WILL GET THE 50% SHARE AND IT WILL DECIDE WHAT IT WISHES TO DO. BY THE WAY AND ALL OF THAT 15% 50% SURE THAT EACH OF THE- LOCAL GOVERNMENT AT THE GOVERNMENTAL AND- ENTITIES GET. WILL BE DETERMINED BY HOW MUCH PARTICIPATION THE REASON THE SETTLEMENT THE MORE THAT THEIR OUTSTANDING- LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THAT DON'T PARTICIPATE. THE LAST OF THE FULL AMOUNT OF THE GOVERNMENTS IN THE STATE WE GET AND SO THAT'S WHY UNITS IMPORTANT HAVE THIS BILL. SO WE GET MOVING IN GET EVERY ON BOARD THAT WATCHED. THOSE THAT DON'T WANT TO AS I SAY WHO FORTY FATHER COMES IN COULD MOVE FORWARD BUT IF YOU'LL NOTICE TO YOUR POINT BECAUSE YOU'RE RIGHT- OFTENTIMES LOCAL GOVERNMENT HAS FELT LIKE IT'S BEEN. SHORT CHANGED BY THE STATE. THE MONEY. ARE ABATEMENT PROGRAMS. MOST OF THOSE MITIGATION PROGRAMS ON OPIOIDS ARE RUN BY COUNTY HEALTH FACILITIES. NOT THE STATE AND SO AT THE END OF THE DAY BECAUSE OUR SETTLEMENT IS DICTATING THAT THE MONEY MUST BE SPENT ON OPIOID SERVICES ABATEMENT PREVENTION. MITIGATION SERVICES THOSE MY WILL HAVE TO END P IN THE HANDS OF THOSE WHO DO THOSE SERVICES AND THE STATE IS NOT IN THE BUSINESS OF DOING DAY TO DAY OPIOID WORK. COUNTY ARE HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS THAT DO IT EARLIER THIS THAT DOES THE STATE. BECAUSE OF ITS- NOT DIRECT ENGAGEMENT ON THE OPIOID. CRISIS IS GOING TO UNDER ESTIMATE THE COST. AND THIS IS CONCERNING ME REGARDING THE SETTLEMENT BECAUSE I THINK IF WE LOOK AT IT FROM A STANDPOINT OF WHAT KIND OF IMPACTS THEIR DIRECT AND INDIRECT IMPACTS. R. THE SETTLEMENT DOLLAR AMOUNTS- WE DON'T WANT TO BE TOO LOW. BECAUSE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN HARMED IN MANY LIFELONG MULTI GENERATIONAL WAYS. BECAUSE OF THIS- FOR EXAMPLE. WHEN YOU GO AYE AYE VISIT MIKE TWENTY SIX PRISONS. EVERY TIME I GO ASKED WARDENS HOW MANY OF PEOPLE ARE HERE BECAUSE OF MENTAL HEALTH OR SUBSTANCE ABUSE. AND HE SAID YOU KIDDING ALMOST ALL OF THEM. AND ALMOST EVERY WORD SAYS YOU TURN GENERAL OF THIS. SO THE COST TO THE STATE GOVERNMENT. IN TERMS OF OUR PRISONS AND THE COUNTIES IN TERMS OF THE JAILS. IS SOMETHING IF WE HAD A FULL SERVICE DRUG TREATMENT FREE AVAILABLE DRUG TREATMENT. WOULD BE TREMENDOUSLY IMPACTED IN A POSITIVE WAY. SO I TAKE THE COUNTIES CAN ADMINISTER AND OPERATE SUCH A PROGRAM. AND MY URGING IS TO USE THE MODEL WHEN WE CREATED THE CHILDREN'S HEALTH CARE WITH THE CIGARETTE. SETTLEMENT WHEN WE HAD THAT WE ENDED UP HAVING ALL THE KIDS IN CALIFORNIA WHETHER UNDOCUMENTED OR OR UNINSURED BY OTHER MEANS COVERED. WHERE THE CHILDREN'S HEALTH CARE. FUNDS COMING FROM THE TOBACCO LAWSUIT SETTLEMENT. AND THAT'S HOW THOSE PROGRAMS WERE FUNDED WE CAN DO THE SIMILAR THING WORKING WITH COUNTIES FOR SUBSTANCE ABUSE IN CALIFORNIA SO. I URGE MORE COMPREHENSIVE LOOK. AT THE AT THE ATATURK ISSUE AND HAVE IT AS PART OF THE GOALS OF A SETTLEMENT TO HAVE A COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TREATMENT PROGRAM. FOR EVERYONE IN CALIFORNIA WHO NEEDS IT THANK YOU. THANK YOU BEFORE I GO TO A US SENATOR MORE LOCKED UP QUICKLY- MISTER TWENTY GENERAL YOU MENTIONED THE COUNTIES AND MEETING WITH C. SECOND COUPLE TIMES WE'VE ALSO HEARD FROM OUR CITY ATTORNEYS WILL ARE THEY BEING INCLUDED IN THE CONVERSATION. YES THEY ARE AND SOME OF THE CITIES ARE REPRESENTED BY OUTSIDE COUNSEL VERSES ARE CITY ATTORNEYS SO WHOEVER THEIR LEGAL REPRESENTATIVES IN THE OPIOID CASE ARE THE FOLKS THAT WE'VE BEEN NEGOTIATING AND TALKING TO. THANK YOU SO MUCH CENTER MORE LOT. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR IN THANK YOU ATTORNEY GENERAL BECERRA- CENTER BELL JUST. YEAH IN THE CONCLUDING REMARKS. STARTED TO ADDRESS- SOME WHERE WHERE I'VE ALREADY BEEN BEFORE WERE BOTH A LITTLE OLDER BUT IN. NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN THE ATTORNEY GENERAL FOR THE STATE OF MISSISSIPPI MISTER MICHAEL MOORE WAS SUCCESSFUL IN. FURTHERING THE NATIONAL TOBACCO SETTLEMENT IN A ATTORNEY GENERAL DAN LUNGREN WAS INVOLVED AT THAT TIME A BIT IT CREATED A REVENUE STREAM SORT OF AN ANNUITY- SO ALL THOSE THAT WERE BENEFITING FROM THE SETTLEMENT AND SO THOSE ARE SOME OF THE QUESTIONS I'D LIKE TO JUST PUT BEFORE YOUR JUST. LAY ON THE TABLE YOU CAN. TECH ONE AT A TIME OR HOWEVER YOU WANT TO ADDRESS THEM BUT I WANT TO KNOW IF YOU'RE WORKING ON A SETTLEMENT THAT TO LUNCHTIME. OR IF IT IS AN ANNUITY. AND THEN YOU'VE ALREADY KIND OF ADDRESS HOW WILL BE APPROPRIATE WITH THE FIFTEEN SEVENTY FIFTEEN PLAN BUT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT MISAPPROPRIATION OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA RECEIVED. ITS SHARE OF THE SETTLEMENT SO DID ALL THE COUNTIES IN CALIFORNIA BUT THE STATE- THROUGH GOVERNOR THEN GOVERNOR DAVIS TOOK THAT REVENUE STREAM SECURITIZED DEBT AND ISSUED A BOND TO. BALANCE THE BUDGET AND SO THAT MONEY DIDN'T GO TO PROGRAMS LIKE SENATOR BILL WAS REFERRING TO MOST OF IT WAS EATEN UP AND PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST- SO IT WAS. I THINK MISAPPROPRIATED IT WAS NOT USED FOR WHAT WAS SUPPOSED TO START I'D LIKE TO KNOW WHAT KIND OF PROTECTIONS YOU'RE PUTTING INTO THIS EEMENT SO THAT IT DOES GO WHERE IT'S SUPPOSED TO GO. AND THEN- SINCE WE'RE USING A BETA PROGRAMS- WEEK WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE USE IT FOR ABATEMENT PROGRAMS AND THEN MY LAST QUESTION MIGHT BE IT IS A QUESTION FOR THE CHAIR- WE HAVE TWO SEPARATE VERY DISTINCT SUBJECTS IN THIS BILL. AND I'M JUST WONDERING WHY. SHOULD THE BILL CAN BE SINGLE SUBJECT AS OPPOSED TO SETTLEMENT TEAM BUILDING VERSUS FISHING GAME AND I'M JUST TRYING TO MAYBE GET AN EXPLANATION. ON THAT THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. THANK YOU MISTER GENERAL. THEY'RE MORE LIKELY FIRST THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION HAD IT I ALMOST GET THE IMPRESSION THAT YOU'VE BEEN INSIDE OR NEGOTIATIONS BECAUSE YOU'VE SOME OF THE POINTS THAT WERE RAISED VERY EARLY ON BY A LOT OF OLKS WHO WERE IS. TO SOME DEGREE DISSATISFIED WITH THE WAY THE TOBACCO SETTLEMENT ROLLED OUT AND LESSONS LEARNT A LOT OF FOLKS SAID THEY LEARNED A LOT ABOUT HOW TO DEAL WITH MASSIVE SETTLEMENTS THAT WAY THAT BROUGHT LARGE PARTS OF MANY TO EACH JURISDICTION AND HOW TO MAKE SURE IT ACTUALLY GOT USED THAT'S WHY WE STARTED FROM THE PREMISE THAT A 100% OF THE FUNDS. MUST GO INTO OPIOIDS SOME OF THE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS AND STATES THAT WHAT WE GOT TO HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF FLEXIBILITY BECAUSE OPIOIDS MAY HAVE CAUSED A LACK OF. EDUCATION OPPORTUNITY FOR KIDS AND WE'D LIKE TO GET THE FAT THE KIDS OR THE- PARENTS WHO DIED FROM OPIOIDS. TO KNOW THAT THEY'RE STILL GOING TO HAVE A CHANCE FOR GOOD EDUCATION FOR. OPIOID JUST BECAUSE INCREASED CRIME IN SOME OF OUR COMMUNITIES. AND A LOT OF OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT HAVE BEEN TAX DEALING WITH. THAT DRUG ADDICTION AND WE SHOULD COMPENSATE THOSE WHO PROTECTED PEOPLE DURING THIS CRISIS. AND SO THAT'S WHY YOU YOU SAW THE LOCALS. AND THE STATE'S THIS STILL HAS TO BE USED FOR OPIATES IT HAS TO BE RELATED TO OPIATES BUT IT HAS A LITTLE BIT MORE DISCRETION. ON WHAT WE WOULD DEFINE IS STILL TACKLING THE CONSEQUENCES OF OPIOID ADDICTION. BUT 70% OF THE FUNDS. OPIOIDS AND WHO DECIDES IT'S NOT THIS. IT WILL BE THE ALL THOSE PLAYERS THE STAKEHOLDERS THIS DOES THE PLAINTIFFS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS COUNTY CITIES AND THE STATE COMING TOGETHER AND- WORKING OUT THE ARRANGEMENTS AND SO WHAT WILL BE A LUMP SUM WILL BE ANYBODY WITH WILL BE ONLY DIRECTED. TO PROGRAM SPECIFIED PROGRAM THAT WILL BE UP TO THOSE IN THE. SITTING DOWN JUST HOW. WILL ALLOCATE THAT SAID PERCENT SHARE AND ONLY THAT WAY AND IN TERMS OF ANY MISAPPROPRIATION AND AGAIN I THINK HERE'S WHERE THE CONCERN IS BY THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THAT THE STATE MAY. USE THAT MONEY IN WAYS THAT WERE NOT EXPECTED UP. THERE AT THE TABLE. THIS IN THIS A SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT IT WAS CLEAR FROM THE VERY GET GO. THEY WILL BE AT THE TABLE MOST OF THOSE THIRTY FIVE HUNDRED LAWSUITS CLEARLY ARE NOT THE STATE'S THERE ONLY FIFTY STATES. IT'S MOSTLY CITIES AND COUNTIES AND QUITE HONESTLY IT'S THE COUNTIES THAT COUNT THE MOST BECAUSE IN MOST PLACES CERTAINLY CALIFORNIA. IF THE COUNTIES WILL PROVIDE. PUBLIC HEALTH. MENTAL HEALTH ALL THE HEALTHCARE SERVICES AND SO THEY WILL BE AT THE TABLE AND THIS BILL. AB SIX DOES NOT DETERMINEOR DIRECT HOW THOSE DOLLARS WILL BE ALLOCATED. THAT IS ONLY THROUGH THE SETTLEMENT AND SO THIS BILL ALL IT DOES IS TRY TO GET US TO MOVE TO GET THOSE DOLLARS BECAUSE WILL FALL WAY BEHIND. IF WE CAN'T GUARANTEE THAT IN CALIFORNIA. THOSE DEFENDANTS CAN LET GO OF THOSE DOLLARS HE COMMITTED FOR THOSE PROGRAMS AND THE LESS THAT THEY CAN CLICK GOAL BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE. THE LIABILITY RELIEF THAT THEY NEED. THE LESS WILL BE ABLE TO DO WITH THE FUNDS THAT ARE THERE. THANK YOU TAMBIéN I'M SURE WHAT ABOUT THE QUESTION OF SINGLE SUBJECT. ALL L. A. O. OR FINANCES EITHER YOU LIKE TO RESPOND. GOOD AFTERNOON I'M SURE I CAN HEAR MY- WE CAN GIVE US YOUR NAME SO THEY CAN FINALLY GET YOU ON THE SCREEN THIS IS OUR NUMBERS OF THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE BY TERMS OF CIVIL CIVIL- SORRY SINGLE SUBJECT ISSUE- I DON'T HAVE ANY. COMMENTS ON THAT EVEN THOUGH THIS IS A LIFE PROPOSAL I WOULD DIE. FOR TO ALLEN IF THEY HAVE LOTS. ANYONE FAMILIAR. THIS IS A NEED ONLY WHAT THE L. A. L. I DON'T THINK THIS IS A LOT OF TROUBLES ON AND WE WOULD DEFER TO THE LEGISLATURE- IN TERMS OF THE CHOICE IN TERMS OF WHAT TO INCLUDE SO WE DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO ADD. A MINUTE SURE WE'RE GETTING YOU KNOW PULLED FROM A LOT OF SITES ACTED TOWNIES THAT ARE OPPOSED THIS BILL I'VE GOT. DISTRICT ATTORNEY SAID THAT SUPPORT IT SO I'M- BOTH A LITTLE CONCERNED OBVIOUSLY YOU SIR SHORT NOTICE AND GETTING INUNDATED- BUT IT'S IT WOULD SEEM THAT IF THIS. WOULD HAVE BEEN TWO BILLS THAT WOULD HAVE RELEASED RESOLVE ONE. PART OF THE EQUATION. ALL I KEEP LISTENING TO THE OTHER QUESTIONS IN IN TESTIMONY IN IT TO WITNESSES THAT CALL THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR FOR LETTING ME PARTICIPATE. I APPRECIATE THAT AND I THINK THE ONE THING I WOULD SAY IN RESPONSE IN TWO MORE LIKE THAT BECAUSE IT ALL INVOLVES THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. THAT DOES TECHNICALLY- FIT WITHIN OUR SINGLE SUBJECT RULE. BECAUSE IT ALL HITS THE SAME DEPARTMENT BUT I CAN UNDER. WHAT YOU'RE CHALLENGE OF HAVING PEOPLE WANTING TO SUPPORT SOME ASPECTS OF IT AND OTHERS WANTED TO SUPPORT A DIFFERENT ASPECT SO THANK YOU. I HAVE. SENATOR HER TOP. WHO WILL BE FOLLOWED BY SENATOR DOLLY AND THEN SENATOR SKINNER FILTER HER TADO. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- YOU KNOW I JUST WANTED TO RIGHTS AND EXPRESS MY CONCERN ON THIS. BUDGET ITEM UP VERTICALLY AROUND A LOT OF THE ISSUES THAT FIGHT GOOD FOR A FRIEND AND COLLEAGUE FROM A SALINAS MENTIONED. EARLIER TODAY- BUT MORE THAN ANYTHING I WILL SUPPORT IT IN COMMITTEE I JUST. WANT X. MY CONCERNS THAT- AND MAY NOT ABOUT FRED ON THE FLOOR. THAT IS IT. THANK YOU US SENATOR DOLLY. GOOD EVENING. I WANTED TO- FIRST OFF JUST TO SAY THAT. I LISTEN TO THE COMMENTS VERY CLOSELY OF- GOOD SENATOR SENATOR BELL WHO SERVED START TO AT TWELVE YEARS. ON THE UP OR SUPERVISORS AND I HAPPEN TO EXCEED HIM BY SIX FOR YEARS I HAVE SIXTEEN YEARS HAPPENED TO BE AROUND WHEN WE DID THAT. BACK OF SETTLEMENT. AND SO ONE OF MY GET MAKE GUESS MY QUESTIONS ARE I MEAN THERE WAS A LOT OF THINGS THAT WENT WRONG WITH THE THAT I THINK IN AND AS WE ALL HEARD TODAY. ALL OF THE SUPPORT I'VE ELEVEN COUNTIES- IF THERE'S ANYTHING THE LAST HOUR HOUR AND A HALF MY PHONE HAS BEEN BLOWING UP IN MY EMAILS HAVE BEEN BLOWING UP AND- THEN JUST QUITE QUITE FRANKLY MY OWN EXPERIENCE WITH THE TOBACCO. WHAT WHAT WE WANT IT'S BACK I WANT TO STAY SOMETHING THAT HASN'T BEEN SAID. THAT IS YOU KNOW THESE PHARMACEUTICALS THAT MADE THESE. VERY DICKEY DRUGS IN NEW THEIR ADDICTIVE AND PLAYED OFF ON OUR CITIZENS NUMBER ONE I THINK THEY NEED TO BUILD BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE. AND JUST LIKE JUST LIKE TOBACCO COMPANIES WERE HELD ACCOUNTABLE AND IT WASN'T UNTIL WE DID PROP. GEN THE FIRST FIVE COMMISSIONS IN THOSE WHO REALLY STARTED SEEING THE TOBACCO MONIES ACTUALLY GET DOWN TO WHERE THEY WERE ACTUALLY HELPING THE PEOPLE. THAT WERE AFFECTED BY HEALTH. AND SO. I MY QUESTION IS FOR THE FOR THE- ATTORNEY GENERAL'S GOOD TO SEE YOU ON THE ZOOM BY THE WAY SIR. AND WHAT IS THE URGENCY HERE THERE'S A LITTLE LACKING A LOT OF DETAIL. ON HOW THIS IS REALLY GOING TO PLAY OUT OBVIOUSLY YOU STATED. QUITE CLEARLY HOW THE- YOU KNOW PERCENTAGES ARE SET FORTH BUT- THE DEVIL IS ALWAYS IN THE DETAILS AND THE COUNTIES ARE THE ONES THAT REALLY GET THE SERVICES OUT AND I'M CONCERNED- THAT. THIS MAY NOT PLAY OUT IN THE OR COULD BE IN THE SUN SAME MANNER. AS A TOBACCO SETTLEMENT SUBCOMMITTEE COULD YOU GIVE ME A REASON WHY WE HAVE TO DO THIS. TODAY NUMBER ONE. AND WHY CAN'T WAIT FOR I KNOW THAT I HEARD THAT YOU KNOW WHAT THERE'S OBVIOUSLY OTHER PEOPLE THE TABLE BUT UP. THERE THEY'RE GONNA BE HED ACCOUNTABLE THE AMERICAN PUBLIC KNOWS. THAT THEY KNEW. AND THEY HAVE DEEP POCKETS TRUST ME THERE'S ANYBODY HAS DEEP POCKETS THEY HAPPEN. AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE HELD ACCOUNTABLE. SO THAT'S MY FIRST QUESTION. AFTER A GREAT ANSWER OF COURSE SIR. THANK YOU SENATE ALL YES GOOD TO SEE YOU AND A GOOD QUESTION AND I'LL TRY ANNALISE'S DIPLOMATICALLY AS I CAN. MOST OF THESE CASES AB I KNOW THEIR CASES HAVE BEEN OUT FOR SIX SEVEN YEARS THAT I'VE BEEN AROUND- AS I SAID THERE'S ABOUT THIRTY FIVE HUNDRED RIGHT NOW LAWSUIT FILED THROUGHOUT THIS. COUNTRY. HERE'S WHAT HAPPENS AND I THINK YOU'LL GET THIS ALL. AND YOUR NUMBER OF JURISDICTIONS THAT ARE FOR WHATEVER REASON DID NOT FILE MANY CASES BECAUSE LIKE PROBABLY MANY COUNTIES IN YOUR DISTRICT THEY'RE SMALL AND THEY DON'T HAVE A LOT OF RESOURCES. IF THEY PARTICIPATE IN THE SENATE THERE GONNA GET THEIR SHARE OF WHAT WOULD COME TO THEM EVEN IF THEY NEVER. PUT A FOOT IN THE DOOR TO FILE A LAWSUIT. BUT HERE'S WHAT THE MOSTLY THE DEFENDANT'S FEAR BUT I THINK THEY'RE RIGHT. THE MOMENT THIS IS ANNOUNCED AS A SETTLEMENT DEAL. SOME BRIGHT ATTORNEY IS GONNA GO RENT TO WHEN YOU'RE COUNTIES AND SAY YOU HAVEN'T FILED YET. YOU KNOW IF YOU FILE YOU MIGHT BE TO EXTRACT A LITTLE BIT MORE OUT OF THESE COMPANIES. BY SAYING THAT YOU NOW I FILE YOUR OWN LAWSUIT SO NOW IT'S NOT JUST THIRTY FIVE HUNDRED LAWSUITS AGAINST IS TO DEFEND IT NOW STREET FIVE HUNDRED AND ONE AND SO THEY SHOULD UP THEIR DEAL A LITTLE BIT MORE BECAUSE THEY'RE THEY'RE IN MORTGAGE. YOU'RE PRETTY LEGALLY. AND WHAT IT DOES. AND BY THE WAY THE-PROBABLY DO THAT FOR. HANDS AND FEET. THAT BRIDGE EVEN THOUGH THEY PROBABLY NEVER TAKE THAT ALL THE WAY TO COURT. RIGHT AND- WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS AVOID THE GAMING OF THE SYSTEM WE'RE CLOSE. BUT SOMEONE'S GOING TO FEEL LIKE THEY CAN GET PRETTY SMART AND TRY TO GAME THE SYSTEM AND SEE IF THEY CAN EXTRACT A LITTLE BIT MORE. AND WHAT THAT DOES IS IT IT WILL MAKE. IF AND IT'S A COOK THIS IS WHAT WE TOLD YOU GUYS ABOUT. CERTAINTY THIS IS. AND THAT'S WHY IN THE SENATE YOU WILL FIND LANGUAGE AS- THE MORE UNCERTAINTY THERE IS- IN TERMS OF OUR BEING SUED OR THE CAPABILITY OF OTHER GOVERNMENTS TO SUE US. THE LAST WEEK AND LET GO OF BECAUSE WE HAVE TO WATCH OUT. WE HAVE TO KEEP MONEY IN OUR POCKETS TO FIGHT OFF ANY POTENTIAL RISK. AND SO IT DEPRIVES THOSE COUNTIES IN YOUR DISTRICT ARE SAYING WE COULD'VE FOUGHT TO SEE ANY OUT. WE'RE WILLING TO TAKE OUR SHARE. OF THE SETTLEMENT AND YOUR- WILL BE DIPPED OF MONEY. BECAUSE THE DEFENDANTS WILL HAVE A RIGHT TO SAY WE CAN'T LET IT ALL GO. AND WHILE THIS DEAL WILL BE IN THE END INTHE BILLIONS OF CALIFORNIA SHOULD BE GETTING IN THE BILLIONS. THERE'S A VERY STRONG CHANCE IF WE HAVE A LOT OF THIS GAMING GOING ON THAT WE MAY FIND THAT WE ARE. PRECLUDED FROM GETTING. AND FOR MAYBE A LONG TIME. ALL OF OUR FAIR SHARE WHICH COULD BE WORK LEAVING AT LEAST MILLIONS PROBABLY HUNDREDS OF NO AND POSSIBLY BILLIONS ON THE TABLE AND I DON'T THINK ANYONE WANTS. TO THANK YOU FOR THAT ANSWER AND I THAT THERE'S ALWAYS A LOT OF WRANGLINGS GOING ON WHEN YOU HAVE- YOUR THERE'S RISK I HEAR YOU. AND AS SOMEBODY WHO SAT IN MANY OF THOSE BOARD MEANS. MAKING THOSE DECISIONS AS WE HAD TRIAL ATTORNEYS SUING US FOR EVERYTHING IN THE COUNTY OVER AT ACCESS AND- KNOW THAT THE DESK WAS A QUARTER OF AN INCH TOO TALL. OR TOO LOW OR WHATEVER YOU NAME IT. LOOK THERE'S ALWAYS AN ATTORNEY OUT THERE THAT WILL- TAKE A CASE OUT ON THE- ON THE ABILITY BILL SETTLED OUT NOT EVER TAKE IT TO COURT WE GET THAT- SO I GUESS MY I JUST WANT TO MAKE A LOT COMMON I DO APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS- DELETED. THE URGENCY OF IT I KNOW THAT THERE'S EVERYBODY OUT THERE. TALKING. ABOUT CALIFORNIA'S A BIG STAKE IN THIS GAME I THERE'S COUNTY IN A PARTY. TOGETHER INCLUDING SOME THAT I REPRESENT. THEY ARE VERY NERVOUS- AND EDUCATION BUT REASON I RAN FOR THE STATE LEGISLATORS BECAUSE I DON'T TRUST THE STATE LEGISLATURE THEY'VE BEEN. TAKING ADVANTAGE OF MY OPINION OF COUNTIES FOR EVER- PASSING UNFUNDED MANDATES AND THE LIKE AND I WAS THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS I RAN FOR THIS JOB WAS TO. BUT SOME. YOU KNOW STOPPING IT BECAUSE IT THEY REALLY THE ONES THAT THEY DO GET THE SERVICES AND THEY'RE HAMSTRUNG AND THEY HAVE NO ABILITY. TO BE ABLE TO RAISE REVENUES- AND I AND AS I STATED EARLIER. YOU KNOW WE SAW THE PRODUCT DIDN'T TAKE HIM OUT OF THAT WAS AS YOU CAN GET FIFTY CENTS A PACK WENT TO THE COUNTIES DIRECTLY AND THEY- WE USED IT TO. FIND OUR UNFUNDED PENSION LIABILITY WAS AWESOME- WAS IT ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO TAKE CARE OF HEALTH ISSUES. IN OUR COUNTIES AND WE WERE ABLE TO FIND IT SO. I'M NOT GOING TO BE A BUT I'M GONNA BE OPPOSING THIS BILL TODAY JUST TO JERRY I THINK WE NEED A LITTLE MORE TIME A LOT MORE DETAIL. NOTHING AGAINST THE THAT YOUR OFFICE OR WHAT YOU'RE DOING THERE BUT I THINK IT IF WE DO A LOT MORE WORK. APPRECIATE YOUR- ANSWERS IN THANK YOU. MADAM CHAIR FOR THE. THANK YOU SENATOR DOLLAR FINISHES. YOU MADAM CHAIR SO TO THE AG ARE PRE IS TO OF THE GAMING THAT COULD OCCUR HOWEVER I THINK THE- WHEN WE THINK ABOUT. THE DAMAGE THAT THOSE PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES WHO KNOWINGLY ANDREA TOBACCO AND ALLERGIES ARE QUITE ACCURATE TO MAKE YOUR KNOWINGLY. DEVELOPED A PRODUCT. THAT THE NEWS WAS HIGHLY ADDICTIVE AND PURPOSEFULLY PUSHED IT AND PUSHED THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY WE DID NOT REVEAL THE INFORMATION ABOUT HOW HOW MUCH THEY KNEW ABOUT ITS ADDICTION. OUR CAPABILITIES BUT THEN PUSH THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY TO UTILIZE OVERSUBSCRIBED AND TO UTILIZE IT FOR SO MANY MORE. TYPES OF TREATMENTS THEN REALLY WOULD EVER BE JUSTIFIED AND WHEN WE THINK ABOUT THE DAMAGE TO OUR COMMUNITIES TO FAMILIES TO INDIVIDUALS TO OUR COUNTIES TO OUR CITIES. IT IS SO SEVERE THAT I HESITATE TO BE IN A SITUATION WHERE WE WOULD NOW PREVENT ANY FUTURE LAWSUITS BECAUSE I THINK THERE COULD BE MORE THE COULD BE UNCOVERED FIRST. SO I'M A LITTLE CONCERNED ABOUT THAT NOW BUT I THINK THE MOST SERIOUS CONCERN IS THAT. WE ARE RECEIVING COMMUNICATIONS FROM OUR CITIES AND COUNTIES THAT HAVE BEEN. THAT HAVE BEEN PARTY'S THESE LAWSUITS WHO INDICATED THAT THEY HAVE REACHED OUT TO THE AG'S OFFICE THAT JUST AS THE AG DESCRIBED THIS TYPE OF. GLOBAL SETTLEMENT IS NOT UNCOMMON AND SO WHAT I'M GETTING FROM THE CITIES AND THE COUNTIES IS NOT SO MUCH THAT THEY ARE OPPOSED TO THIS. POTENTIAL CONCEPT BUT RATHER THE ONCE MORE THE DETAILS WORKED OUT AND OUT WHEN THEY LOOK AT WHAT THE DETAILS SO FAR THE OTHER STATES. THE LEGISLATION THAT OTHER STATES HAVE DONE THAT WOULD INCORPORATE CITIES AND COUNTIES THERE'S MORE OF THE DETAIL HAS BEEN SPELLED OUT AND THAT THEY ARE VERY CONCERNED THAT WITHOUT THAT SPELLED OUT DETAIL. WE ARE REALLY TOO MUCH WASHING YOUR HANDS OF. OF HOW- HOW THESE FUNDS MIGHT BE DISPERSED AND- HI I THINK THE AG IF YOU WANT TO RESPOND TO THAT I KNOW YOU TO SORT OF ADDRESS THIS BUT THAT IS THE CLEAR COMMUNICATION. THAT WE ARE GETTING FROM OUR CITIES AND COUNTIES. AND MANAGER IF I COULD RESPOND YES PLEASE. SERVICE CENTER SKINNER OF AND GOOD POINT AND- HERE'S WHAT CONFUSES ME ABOUT WHAT SOME OF THE- THE ATTORNEYS FOR THESE- LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE SAYING- THIS BILL IN NO WAY CAN DRIVE ANY PART OF THE SETTLEMENT DISCUSSION. THE REALITY IS THAT THIS BILL SIMPLY SAYS. TWO THINGS. FIRST IT SAYS. IF YOU HAVEN'T ALREADY FILED A CLAIM AGAINST THESE DEFENDANTS. THEN YOU CAN'T RUSH TO THE COURTHOUSE TO TRY TO DO IT NOW WHICH WOULD ESSENTIALLY MAKE THE DEFENDANTS BACK OFF OF PROVIDING THE FULL RESOURCES IN THE SECOND. AND SO WE'RE TRYING TO SAY. THE GAME HAS CONCLUDED LET'S TALLY UP THE SCORE SO WE CAN MOVE AND DETERMINE HOW TO DISTRIBUTE THE RESOURCES TO MAKE IT TO DEAL WITH THE HARM CAUSED BY THE OPIOID CRISIS. IT'S AND IT'S VERY CLEAR MOST OF THE PEOPLE YOU'RE HEARING FROM. ARE THE FOLKS WHO HAVEN'T SUIT. IT'S THE FOLKS WHO HAVE TO. AND CRAPPIE HONEST WITH YOU AND FORGIVE ME AGAIN I'M GONNA TRY TO BE DIPLOMATIC YOU'RE NOT HEARING SO MUCH FROM THE SUPERVISORS FROM THEIR ATTORNEYS. AND BY THE WAY. GO DEEPER YOU'RE NOT REALLY HEARING FROM THE COUNTY COUNCIL'S. YOU'RE HERE FOR THE PRIVATE ATTORNEYS THAT THESE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE HIGHER. THE FOLLOWING THIS BUILT IN A DAY. WILL END UP PROVIDING FOR ATTORNEYS FEES. SUBSTANTIALLY IN THE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS- I UNITED I'M I WILL TELL YOU I AM UP TO HEAR. WITH THESE ARGUMENTS THAT I'M HEARING BECAUSE- THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE A SEAT AT THE TABLE THIS BILL CANNOT CLOSE THAT DOOR. THIS BILL SIMPLY SAYS NO MORE NEW LAWSUITS AGAINST THESE DEFENDANTS SINCE YOU KNEW THIS THIS WORK ON THE SETTLEMENT HAS BEEN UNDER WAY FOR MORE THAN TWO YEARS. AND SO TO RUSH TO THE COURTHOUSE DOOR TO FILE A CLAIM WHEN WE GOT THE SETTLEMENT IN PLACE IS SIMPLY TO REALLY. GET IN THE WAY OF COMMUNITIES THAT ARE READY TO MOVE FORWARD DOING SO AND THE FINAL THING I MENTIONED IS THE OTHER IMPORTANT PROVISIONS IN THIS BILL THAT SPEAKS TO THIS. OPIOID IT SAYS WHAT THE SET UP WITH A STATEWIDE OPIATE OPIOID SIX SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT IS. IT SAYS IT MEANS ANY SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS. ARE CONSENT PER STIPULATED JUDGMENT AND RELATED DOCUMENTS. CONCERNING OPIOIDS DETECTOR BOB THE FUNDS OBTAINED THIS IS ELEVEN NINE NINE NINE POINT THREE TO THE FUNDS OBTAINED BY THE STATE. PURSUANT TO A STATEWIDE OPIOID SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT PURSUANT TO A STATEWIDE OPIOID SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT SHALL BE DISTRIBUTED NOT PURSUANT THIS IS BILL BUT SHALL BE DISTRIBUTED IN A MANNER. CONSISTENT WITH THAT AGREEMENT. IN A MANNER CONSISTENT WITH THAT AGREEMENT THAT MEANS THIS BILL DOESN'T DRIVE ANYTHING WITH REGARD TO THE SETTLEMENT. IT SIMPLY SAYS NO MORE RUSHING TO THE COURTHOUSE DOOR TO FILE CLAIMS THAT YOU COULD HAVE FILED A TIME TO AND YOU MUST ABIDE BY THE TERMS OF THAT SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT WHICH AS WE'VE HAD DISCUSSED ABOUT PREVIOUSLY WITH OTHER SENATORS. MUST INCLUDE ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND THE STATE GOVERNMENT DETERMINING HOW THOSE MONIES WILL BE JUST DISPERSED IN THAT STATE JURISDICTION. YES SO IT'S- BACK IF YOU SENSE OF FRUSTRATION IS BECAUSE THAT'S WHY IT'S TAKEN SO LONG TO GET TO THIS POINT. BECAUSE WE'VE ALWAYS GOT SOMEBODY WHO WANTS TO KNOCK ON THE DOOR. AND I WILL TELL YOU THERE ARE A WHOLE BUNCH OF COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE BEEN WAITING TO GET RELIEF IF THESE FOLKS ARE REALLY SERIOUS ABOUT NEEDING TO FILE A CLAIM. THEN WHY HAVEN'T THEY DONE IT BACK TO PROTECT THE INTERESTS OF THE FOLKS AND THEY SAY THEY REPRESENT. IT IS KIND OF INTERESTING THAT ONLY NOW THAT WE SEEM TO HAVE A SETTLEMENT AT HAND. ONLY NOW TO HEAR PEOPLE SAY OH MY GOSH MY CHANCE TO SUE IS GOING TO BE LIMITED. YOU HAD YEARS YOU'VE KNOWN ABOUT THE OPIOID CRISIS FOR YEARS WHY DID YOU FINALLY GET TO PROTECT YOUR PEOPLE BACK THEN. YEAH I UNDERSTAND THIS TO COME LAST MINUTE WE DID NOT EXPECT THE DEFENDANT TO GIVE US A SOLID RESPONSE TO WORK TO OUR DEMAND. AND BECAUSE OF THAT WE HAVE A CHANCE TO BRING THIS YEAR THE TIPPING POINT TO A GOOD END. BUT WE'RE NOT GOING TO LET THIS BE ABUSED BY BY INDIVIDUALS WHO JUST WANT TO. REALLY GET IN THE SYSTEM. IF I CAN JUST FOLLOW UP ABSOLUTELY SAID THANK YOU CHAIR. SO I AM HEARING FROM MAYORS I AM NOT ONLY HEARING FROM CITY ATTORNEYS I'M ALSO HEARING FROM MEMBERS OF PORTS OF SOUPS. NOW YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT THEY COULD HAVE USED AN EXTERNAL COUNSEL. BUT THE ONES I AM HEARING FROM MARK ACTUALLY FILED LAWSUITS SO THEY'RE NOT PARTY THEY'RE NOT ENTITIES THAT DID NOT FILE A LAWSUIT. SO THAT THEIR OBJECTION IS NOT THAT DAY WOULD. LATER BE PRECLUDED THOUGH I THINK THERE IS A LEGITIMATE ISSUE AROUND OUT BUT LET IT GO LET THAT DECIDE I THINK THERE'S- A- IF THE BILL IS AS SIMPLE AND STRAIGHTFORWARD THEN IT'S HARD FOR ME TO UNDERSTAND WHY THOSE CITIES AND COUNTIES CAN'T READ IT IN THE SAME WAY THAT YOU ARE DESCRIBING AND I THINK. THAT ALONE THERE IS EITHER A SERIOUS LACK OF COMMUNICATION OR DAY THEIR READ IS VERY DIFFERENT THAN THE ARE AT DOJ'S READ- AND IT'S HARD FOR US TO DISCERN RIGHT NOW WHICH WHICH IS THE CASE. I'M SURE IF I COULD JUST ADD TO THE CENTERS QUESTION GIVE YOU EITHER GIVE A CLEAR RESPONSE. MAY I RESPOND AS MANAGER OF COURSE YES PLEASE. SO CENTERS HERE LET ME JUST REPEAT TO YOU FROM SECTION ELEVEN NINE NINE NINE POINT THREE THREE I'M NOT GOING TO TRY TO. GET A TO REALIZE HERE I'LL JUST READ IT STRAIGHT FROM THE LANGUAGE IN THE BILL. IN A STATEWIDE OPIOID SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT. THE ATTORNEY GENERAL MAY RELEASE ANY CLAIM RELATED TO THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THE SETTLEMENT. THAT MAY BE BROUGHT BY A GOVERNMENT ENTITY AGAINST A SETTLING DEFENDANTS. EXCEPT THOSE CLAIMS FILED BY A GOVERNMENT ENTITY BEFORE AUGUST TWENTY FOURTH TWENTY TWENTY. AND JUST TO PUT IT MORE LAYMAN'S TERMS. AS I SAID IF YOU HAVEN'T ALREADY FILED YOUR SUIT. THEN WE WILL LIMIT YOUR ABILITY GOING NOW THAT WE GOT TO SELL BUT IF YOU LIKE THOSE CITY. A CITY THAT YOU MENTION THOSE MAYORS IMAGINE HOW FILE SUIT. THEY'RE NOT IMPLICATED AB SIX DOESN'T AFFECT THEM. THEY CAN MOVE FORWARD WITH THEIR LOSS IT'S ALL THE WAY TO CORDON THROUGH A JURY TRIAL IF THEY WISH. AB SIXTY DOESN'T STOP AT. EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THOSE HOW AT FIVE HUNDRED JURISDICTIONS THAT HAVE ALREADY SUED. KEEP GOING. THEY DON'T HAVE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE SETTLEMENT. THEY CAN STRUGGLE ALL THE WAY. AB SIX SIMPLY SAYS MOVING FORWARD SO ALL THOSE FOLKS WHO'VE ALREADY FILED THEIR CLAIMS ARE PROTECTED AND WE DON'T INTEND TO GET IN THE WAY IF THEY DON'T WISH TO PARTICIPATE IN SO THEY'RE NOT REQUIRED TO AND SO IF THERE'S NO AMBIGUITY HERE. I THAT'S WHY I DON'T GET WHY SO MANY THESE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE CONCERNED EXCEPT THAT THEY'RE HEARING FROM THEIR ATTORNEYS THAT THEY SHOULD BE CONCERNED. AND SO I AM ONE OF THESE I DO INTEND TO DO AS I CAN TO REACH OUT TO A BUNCH OF GUYS SUPERVISORS. AND MAYORS BECAUSE I WE GET INTO THE TERMS OF THE PAYMENT OF ATTORNEY'S FEES AND THE TERMS OF THE POT THAT WOULD DISTRIBUTED. BECAUSE IN THAT FIFTEEN SEVENTY FIFTEEN POT. FIFTEEN JERK ST FIFTEEN TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS 70% FOR ABATEMENT. THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS I DETERMINE HOW TO DISTRIBUTE THE 15% AMONG THE FIFTY STATES AND FOR THOSE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IN THE FIFTY STATES THE STATE AG'S DETERMINE HOW TO DETERMINE THE 50% PART AMONGST FIFTY STATES I WOULD ENCOURAGE EVERY LOCAL GOVERNMENT MAYOR AND COUNTY SUPERVISOR WHO'S LISTENING TO BE RIGHT NOW TO ASK. HOW MUCH ARE THEY GOING TO GET IN CALIFORNIA OF THAT 15% PORTION THAT'S ALLOCATED TO ALL THE CITY AND COUNTY GOVERNMENTS IN THE NATION. AND I CAN TELL YOU THE ANSWER. AND IT'S GOING TO BE LESS THAN THEIR PROPORTIONATE SHARE THEIR WE'RE GOING TO GET FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IN OUT OF THE FIFTY STATES OUT OF THAT 50% SURE THAT. OKAY FOR THE STATE'S. AND THAT'S BECAUSE AT THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE WE WERE UNWILLING. TO GO WITH ANY ALLOCATION FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THAT UNDER REPRESENTED OUR POPULATION. AND SO WE'RE GETTING MORE THAN 10% OF ANY POT OF MONEY AND THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HOW MUCH THEY'RE GETTING. OUT OF THAT COUNTIES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HOW MUCH OF THAT 50% PART. IN THE NATION THAT'S RESERVE TO THE CITY ACCOUNTS THEY'RE GETTING. ALMOST TWO PERCENTAGE POINTS LAST. THAT'S A DEAL THAT THEIR ATTORNEYS NEGOTIATED FOR THEM. AND SO I JUST. FOLKS TO RECOGNIZE THAT THERE IS CONCERN HERE ABOUT THIS BILL NOT BECAUSE IT'S SO- DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND IT'S HARD NOT TO BE ABLE TO MAKE SENSE AT THREE OR FOUR PARAGRAPHS AND THE WORDS ARE NOT AMBIGUOUS. BUT THERE IS A LOT OF GAME GOING ON BUT I GET IT IS LAST MOMENT I APOLOGIZE FOR THAT WE DID NOT EXPECT THAT WOULD BE ABLE TO MOVE THIS QUICKLY TOWARDS A RESOLUTION OF A GLOBAL DEAL ON ON TRACK I ABSOLUTELY UNDERSTAND THE CONCERNS THAT YOU'RE EXPRESSING ON BEHALF OF YOUR CONSTITUENTS. SENATOR PAN. THANK YOU AND- PRECIADO EXPLANATIONS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL HIGH AFTER THAT I'VE NEVER HAD NOT SERVED ON THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS I'M NOT ATTORNEY AND JUST THE DOCK- BUT- I ALSO POINT OUT THAT IS A POSITION THAT I WORK IN THE ER I TAKE CARE OF PATIENTS FIRST AND THEN I FIGURE OUT WHETHER YOU GET PAID OR NOT LATER- AND- IN THE CLINIC AND I TAKE A MEDIC CAL WE CAN TALK ABOUT MEDICAL RATES AND OTHER FACTORS STILL TAKE CARE OF THEM- SO LET'S TALK ABOUT TOURNEY'S NOW. SO FIRST COMMENT FIRST I DO HAVE A BRIEF COMMENTS ABOUT. I KNOW THAT SOME MY COLLEAGUES HAVE TALKED ABOUT THE- SORTIE- REGARDING FISHING GAME AND- I GUESS THE MAIN ISSUE THERE- WHICH- I. AND I APPRECIATE THE EXPLANATION AGES GIVEN ON THAT IS JUST THAT YOU KNOW WE DON'T. PUT PEOPLE IN DOUBLE TRIPLE JEOPARDY IN TERMS OF HOW MANY DIFFERENT PEOPLE COME AFTER THEM SO THAT THEY KNOW UNDERSTAND WHAT KIND OF RULES THAT FILE I THINK THAT. PERHAPS IS THE MAIN PRINCIPLE I UNDERSTAND WHAT. THE AGS SAID ABOUT- HIS. NEED FOR THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE TO BE ABLE TO ACT- SOMEWHAT INDEPENDENTLY BUT I THINK AGAIN- YELLED THERE MAYBE FIFTY EIGHTY AS BUT THAT THEY DON'T HAVE JURISDICTION OVER THE STATUS. THE WHOLE STATE SO YOU PRIMARILY ONLY FACING ONE OR TWO DAYS OF HIM ACCOUNT COUNTIES OR JURISDICTIONS OR BOB THAT BUT- SIDE FROM THAT JUST ON THE OPIOID SETTLEMENT. ISSUE AND I APPRECIATE ALL THE EXPLANATIONS I GUESS THE ONE QUESTION I DO HAVE. ON. THAT IS THAT. ON 15% SO YOU TALK ABOUT SEVENTY PERCENT- FOR- TREATMENT PROGRAMS AND SO FORTH WHICH I THINK IS GOOD YOU KNOW WE WANT TO HAVE ACTUALLY MOST OF MONEY GOES THERE. AN EXISTING PERCENT FOR THE STATE 15% FOR- LOCALITIES. CAN YOU PERHAPS ADDRESS- HOW THAT 15% LOCALITIES WILL BE DIVVIED UP AMONG THE LOCALITIES BECAUSE WE HAVE LOCLITIES THAT HAVE ACTUALLY PARTICIPATED HAVE SUITS. SOME OF THEM MAY DECIDE NOT TO BE PART OF SETTLEMENT CONTINUE ON THEIR SUITS AS YOU MENTIONED. YOU THEN YOU HAVE YOUR CALORIES THAT HAVEN'T WE'RE GONNA FORBID THEM FROM BEING ABLE TO WEIGH IN IN THE FUTURE- DO THEY HAVE ANY PIECE OF THAT HOW'S THAT GOING TO BE DECIDED AMONGST ALL THE CITIES AND COUNTIES AND LOCALITIES IN CALIFORNIA. WHAT PORTION THAT THAT GOING TO BE DIVVIED UP- AND I THINK THAT SOME OF THE- THINGS THAT COME BACK AS YOU KNOW PEOPLE SAID WELL WHAT ABOUT THE MONEY WE VERY PUT IN TO PURSUE THIS LAWSUIT WILL TALK ABOUT THE PEOPLE READY FILED SUITS- THAT THE LOCALITIES- AND DECIDE SO CAN YOU PERHAPS ADDRESS. THAT ISSUE SPECIFICALLY. ENTER. PLEASE SIR GO AHEAD. A SURVEY GREAT QUESTIONS UP BY THE WAY FIRST. UNDER THE- ON THE FISH AND WILDLIFE DIVISION THAT THERE COULD BE NO DOUBLE JEOPARDY PLEASE UP LET ME MAKE SURE THAT THAT'S CLEARLY WE YOU CAN GO TO KEEP GOING AFTER A PARTICULAR- STAKEHOLDERS THAT WAY SO. YOU SHOULD HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THAT- BUT ON THE OPIOIDS DEAL- ON THE 50% OF FIRST. EVERY JURISDICTION AS I MENTIONED THERE WILL BE. BILLIONS IN THE POT FOR ATTORNEYS FEES AND COSTS. EVERY JURISDICTION WILL BE ABLE TO RECOUP A FILE TO RECOUP ITS ATTORNEYS FEES AND COSTS EVERY JURISDICTION- AS I SAID. THERE'S A BILLIONS THAT WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR ATTORNEYS FEES AND COSTS I WILL TELL YOU THAT FROM MY PERSPECTIVE I WOULD PUT MORE THAT MONEY INTO A BASEMENT. WE DIDN'T- YOUR SO IF I CAN SAY TO YOU M. AND I MEAN IT. SINCERELY THE STATE CALIFORNIA PRETTY DEAL BECAUSE THE RATE THAT WE PAY OUR ATTORNEYS IS. A FRACTION OF. WHAT SOME OF THESE FULL CHARGING LOCAL CAN DO THE SOME GONNA PUT YOU A LITTLE BIT. THIRTY APPRECIATE SO I LIKE TO HEAR A LITTLE MORE ABOUT HOW. YOU SAID THERE'LL BE PLENTY OF MONEY IN THE 15% I AGREE WITH YOU WE CAN PUT MORE OF IT IN THE BASEMENT THAT'S- WHAT THEY LIKE TO SEE BUT YOU HAVEN'T REALLY ANSWERED THE QUESTION ABOUT SO WHAT PROCESS- WHAT. MECHANISM DO YOU SEE BEING EMPLOYED TO DECIDE HOW TO DIVVY UP THAT 15% THAT GOES TO LOCALITIES IS IT- EACH LOCALITY WHO PARTICIPATES IN THE SETTLEMENT. SINISTER ATTORNEY FEES AND HE GET ALL OF IT ASSUMING THERE'S ENOUGH MONEY FOR THAT WHICH YOU SEEN THE CRUSADER PROBABLY WILL. IS IT NOTE THIS THAT THE LOCALITIES HAVE DECIDED TO NOT BE PART OF SETTLEMENT AND CONTINUE TO PURSUE THEIR OWN CASES. VERY FILE. ID DO THEY GET ANY OF THIS OR NOT BUT SINCE ARE. GOING THEIR OWN PATH TODAY. PLACE THAT HAVE NOT FILED. DO THEY GET A PORTION OF THAT AT ALL. OBVIOUSLY WE'RE GOING TO BAN THEM FROM BEING ABLE TO FILE ANYTHING PASSED THE TWENTY FOURTH OKAY NEED PERHAPS. IS THIS SOMETHING THAT. WHO'S GONNA BE AT THE TABLE TO DECIDE HOW THAT 50% GETS DIVVIED UP. SO YOU YOU'LL BE HAPPY TO KNOW THAT. TO PAY ATTORNEYS FEES AND COSTS YOU ARE A LOCAL GOVERNMENT WILL NOT HAVE TO DO IT INTO THE 50% POT THAT IT WILL GET. THERE IS A SEPARATE POT. A CIVICALLY FOR ATTORNEYS FEES AND COSTS THAT HAS AND THAT WILL HAVE NO IMPACT OR WILL NOT DIP INTO THE FIFTEEN PERCENT. OKAY 70% OR THE OTHER STANDALONE THERE WILL BE A STANDALONE PRODUCT. CARE PAY FOR ATTORNEYS FEES AND COSTS THAT WILL NOT IMPACT THOSE. DOLLARS THAT ARE AVAILABLE FOR. EACH IN TERMS OF WHO GETS WHO CAN DEPEND. IF YOU HAVE FILED A CLAIM. AND YOU DECIDE NOT TO PARTICIPATE IN THE SETTLEMENT BECAUSE YOU WANT TO CONTINUE FORWARD WITH YOUR LAWSUIT RIGHT THEN OBVIOUSLY YOU CANNOT. GET MONEY FROM THE POT BECAUSE YOU'VE DECIDED YOU WANT TO GO YOUR OWN WAY AND- MOVE YOUR MOVE YOUR LAWSUIT- AND SO YOU WILL NOT PARTICIPATE. BUT BE BECAUSE YOU DON'T PARTICIPATE. YOU REDUCE THE AMOUNT IN THE POT. THAT EVERY OTHER LOCAL GOVERNMENT. AND STATE OKAY. YES THEIR SHARE BECAUSE THE DEFENDANTS WILL REQUIRE THAT A RESERVE BE CAPPED. TO COVER THEIR RISK OF THE LITIGATION THAT CONTINUES FORWARD BY OTHER JURISDICTIONS. AND THAT'S WHY EIGHTY SIX IS SO IMPORTANT BECAUSE WE'RE TRYING TO GET EVERYONE TO COME TO TERMS NOW WE'VE BEEN GOING THROUGH THIS WITH THE THIRTY FIVE HUNDRED DIFFERENT JURISDICTIONS AT ISSUE WITH THE FOLKS THAT HAVE ENSUED. AND SAYING OKAY WE GOT A DEAL BY THE WAY ALL THESE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS THAT WERE PART OF THIS FINAL NUMBER THAT WE'RE COMING TO. IT'S NOT AS IF THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHERE WE WERE ON THE NUMBER OKAY AND SO FOR THEM TO SAY WOW YOU'RE GONNA FOR CLOSE OUR OPPORTUNITY TO SUE. IT'S VERY DISINGENUOUS OKAY. PART OF THIS OKAY I'VE- ALL ALONG AND IT'S ESPECIALLY HARD FOR ME TO. SWALLOW IF. LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WHO HAVE ATTORNEYS WHO'VE BEEN PART OF THIS ARE SAYING WELL WAIT A MINUTE WE DON'T GET WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO OF COURSE YOU KNOW WE'RE TRYING TO DO WE'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS THE CONCERNS. THAT THE DEFENDANTS OUT OF GETTING CERTAINTY THAT THEY WON'T BE SUED. AND SO TO GET THAT WE GOTTA GET CLAIMS RELEASED. BY ALL THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IN THE STATE AND THAT'S ALL WE'RE TRYING TO DO TOO EVEN- SIX AND WE DON'T LIMIT ANYONE WHO'S ALREADY SUIT. AND WE ONLY LIMIT THOSE WHO HAVEN'T SEEN. BY AUGUST TWENTY FOURTH TWENTY TWENTY. IT'S VERY SIMPLE THE END OF THE PLAN YOU HAVE A FOLLOW UP QUESTION YES THANK YOU I GET THAT MAIN POINT I WAS JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT THE MORE SPECIFICS ABOUT THE 15% APPRECIATE KNOWING THERE'S A SEPARATE POT TO ADDRESS THE TOURNEY FEES THAT FOR THOSE WHO DECIDE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE SETTLEMENT THANK YOU.

YEAR WELCOME SENATOR MORLOCK. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FOR MEMBERS. ALL RIGHT SEEN NONE WE WILL MOVE ON TO ASSEMBLY BILL. ONE OH SEVEN GENERAL GOVERNMENT. FINANCE. GOOD EVENING MADAM CHAIR AND VICE CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE- CHRIS COOK WITH DEPARTMENT FINANCE. YES GO AHEAD. ARE YOU GOING TO PRESENT. ON THI. AB ONE OH SEVEN. THE GENERAL GOVERNMENT TRAILER BILL MAKES VARIOUS CHANGES AND CLEAN UP THE JANET DOES A REALLY GOOD JOB OF OUTLINING THOSE CHANGES SO I'LL JUST HIGHLIGHT A FEW OF THOSE NOTABLE ITEMS AB ONE OH SEVEN ESTABLISHES THE CALIFORNIA ECONOMIC IMPROVEMENT TAX ABOUT YOUR ACT WHICH WOULD REQUIRE THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD IN CONSULTATION WITH THE TREASURE AND FINANCE TO DEVELOP A COMPREHENSIVE PLAN FOR A CALIFORNIA ECONOMIC IMPROVEMENT TAX VOUCHER PROGRAM- IT CLARIFIES THAT THE EMPLOYER WHO EMPLOYS MIGRANT FARM WORKERS CANNOT SELL RENT OR SUBLEASE THE HOUSING THAT IS SUBSIDIZED BY THE STATE. AND CLARIFIES THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE INSPECTION OF THOSE HOMES THAT ARE NOT SUBSIDIZED BY THE DEPARTMENT. IT PROVIDES AUTHORITY FOR THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD TO SHARE INCOME DATA FOR THE EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT. AT ITS FEDERAL EMPLOYMENT PROGRAMS AND THE AUTHORITY TO EXCHANGE DATA WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES FOR INDIVIDUALS IN THE CALIFORNIA EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT AND FOR HOUSEHOLDS WHO HAVE NOT YET RECEIVED FEDERAL STIMULUS CHECKS FROM THE CARES ACT. AB ONE SEVEN ALSO PROVIDES AN EXTENSION FOR COUNTY ASSESSORS TO CONDUCT PROPERTY TAX APPEAL HEARINGS. AND CLARIFIES THAT REMOTE HEARINGS CAN BE USED FOR THOSE PURPOSES. AND FINALLY ROUTE REQUIRES THE DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT OF THEIR THE EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT BEGINNING SEPTEMBER FOURTH. UNTIL JULY ONE TWENTY TWENTY ONE TO MAKE SPECIFIED INFORMATION RELATED TO UNEMPLOYMENT PROGRAM. THE EMPLOYMENT PROGRAM AVAILABLE ON THE DEPARTMENT'S WEBSITE. WITH THAT I'M JOIN REMOTELY- BY MY COLLEAGUES FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WHO ARE AVAILABLE TO SPEAK IN FURTHER DETAIL OR ANSWER QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE ON THIS TRAILER BILL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ANY QUESTIONS FOR MEMBERS. A THIRTY DORADO. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- FIRST I WANT TO THANK THE ADMINISTRATION AND ARE SENATE BUDGET COMMITTEE STAFF OFF FOR THEIR ORK THIS PAST YEAR ON THE ENFORCEMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF AB SEVENTEEN EIGHTY THREE TO ENSURE QUALITY FARM WORKER HOUSING IN CALIFORNIA I HAVE A RAISE THIS ISSUE MULTIPLE TIMES AND IN MANY WAYS- TO MAKE SURE THAT- ALONG WITH MY COLLEAGUES IN THE ASSEMBLY IN HERE. UP TO REALLY PUSH FOR PEACE AND FARMWORKER HOUSING FOR FARMWORKERS- MANY OF OUR FARMWORKERS SISTERS AND BROTHERS FACE HIGH RENTS AT THE SAME TIME FOR VERY UNSAFE AND INADEQUATE LIVING THIS IS BEEN A BATTLE IN THE FIELDS FOR MANY YEARS DATING BACK TO THE BATTLES OF THE UNITED FARM WORKERS UNION- AGAINST PESTICIDES FOR HUMANE HOUSING- AND HAVING LIVED THROUGH ALL OF THAT AND NOT HAVING HAD HOUSING MYSELF FOR OUR FAMILY THIS IS VERY- IMPORTANT TO ME PERSONALLY. UP TODAY TENCENT OVERCROWDED BUNK HOUSES ARE STILL CONSIDERED BY SOME AS BEING ADEQUATE FARMWORKER HOUSING BUT I THINK ALL OF US BELIEVE THAT WORKERS DESERVE DIGNIFIED HOUSING NOT JUST TO BE CROWDED UP. CURRENTLY H. A EMPLOYERS ARE OBLIGATED TO PROVIDE HOUSING TO WORKERS IN THAT FEDERAL PROGRAM. INDIVIDUALS IN THAT PROGRAM SOMETIMES EXPERIENCED WAGE THEFT HUMAN TRAFFICKING FORCED LABOUR. AND ABUSES OF H. TWO A. WORKERS HAVE INTENSIFIED ESPECIALLY DURING THIS CRISIS. BUT WE MUST BE DILIGENT TO ENSURE THAT OUR STATE DOLLARS ARE NOT USED TO SUBSIDIZE HOUSING FOR H. TWO A. WORKERS. THOSE WORKERS DESERVE THE HOUSING BUT THAT'S THE EXCLUSIVE DUTY AND RESPONSIBILITY OF THE EMPLOYERS WHO PARTICIPATE IN THE H. TWO A. PROGRAM. SO I JUST WANT TO SAY THOSE FEW WORDS BECAUSE IT SEEMS TO KEEP POPPING UP HERE OR THERE AND I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE WERE. CONTINUE TO BE VIGILANT OVER HOW OUR STATE DOLLARS ARE SPENT THANK YOU MANAGER. THANK YOU SENATOR SENATOR MORLOCK. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THE- TAX VOUCHER ACT HAS ME VERY CURIOUS. WHEN YOU HAVE SOMEONE PREPAY TAXES THAT SAID DEBORAH TO CASH CREDIT TO LIABILITY. AND THAT'S A DEAD END SO I'M JUST CURIOUS IF WE'RE CREATING A DAD WITH THIS. SCHEME WOULD REQUIRE THAT A GO BEFORE THE VOTERS IN A BALLOT MEASURE IN. SHOULDN'T THAT BE APPROVED BY A TWO THIRDS VOTE- IF YOU'RE BORROWING AND I'M I'M JUST CURIOUS IF THAT HAS ALREADY BEEN RESEARCHED AS- THIS THIS DISCUSSION HAS STARTED. FINANCE. RISCO CLICK FINANCE- I BELIEVE MY COLLEAGUE J. CHAMBERLAIN IS ON THE LINE- ARE YOU SENATORS QUESTION. YES GOOD EVENING ST TERM DEPARTMENT FINANCE SO- THIS WAS THIS IS ACTUALLY A LEGISLATIVE PROPOSAL. AND I DON'T I CAN'T SPEAK TO WHETHER WITH THE TWO THIRDS. VOTE A TEST HAS BEEN HAS BEEN LOOKING TO. MISTER CHAIRMAN WHAT HAVE YOU DONE ANY RESEARCH ON THIS TRIP LIKE I DO WE HAVE ANOTHER STATE THAT'S ALREADY DONE THIS. I AM NOT AWARE OF ANY OF THE STATE'S DONE THIS. OKAY SO WHERE WHAT WHAT WHERE WOULD ONE GO TO. TOOL RESEARCHERS SHOULD WE JUST WAIT FOR LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL TO FLUSH IT OUT FOR US AND LET ME CHECK IN WITH L. A. O. ALSO- SEARCH MORE LIKE TO SEE IF THERE'S SOMEONE THERE WHO MAY HAVE A RESPONSE ALEJO. HI THIS GOOD EVENING THIS IS CAROLINE CHIU FROM LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE- CENTER ROCK WE HAVE NOT OUR RESEARCH THE SPECIFIC QUESTION YOU'RE ASKING IN TERMS OF WHETHER OR NOT- THE TEXT FILE TO PROPOSAL WOULD CONSTITUTE DEBT HOWEVER- THE PER. DAY PROVISIONS IN THE BILL- ACTUALLY ARE. WOULD BE FOR THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD AND CONSULT CONSULTATION WITH THE TREASURER AND- THE DEPARTMENT FINANCE TO. BRING FORWARD A PROPOSAL TO THE LEGISLATURE FOR. I TAX FEDERAL PROGRAM AS YOU OUTLINED- BY THE SPRING OF NEXT YEAR SO I DO ANTICIPATE THAT THIS WOULD BE. A QUESTION THAT. I THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD WOULD FLUSH OUT ININ ITS WORK ON DEVELOPING THIS PROPOSAL AND I THINK IT IS IT IS ONE WHERE. THEY THEY LIKELY WOULD NEED TO THINK ABOUT- ANY CONSTITUTIONAL CONSTRAINTS- SUCH A- AT. MECHANISM WOULD CREATE. A YOU SEE HOW HOW IT WOULD RELATE TO ALL THE OTHER BONDS AND- TENSION AN OPEB. LIABILITIES WE HAVE IN IN THE ENTIRE SCHEME IS- RUTH YESTERDAY IN ANOTHER. SETTING THAT BOY WE ARE WE ARE LOOKING AT ADDING SO MUCH DEBT SO FAST. AND TO THE BALANCE SHEET AND WE ALREADY HAVE ONE OF THE LARGEST AND- RESTRICTED NET DEFICITS IN IN THE NATION AND IF- MISTER RESPONSE ON WE'RE HERE I'D ASK HIM WHERE'S OUR COMPREHENSIVE ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT YOU ARE HERE IT'S ALMOST IN A SESSION WE STILL HAVEN'T RECEIVED IT THE ONLY STATE. THAT YOU KNOW WE HAVEN'T GOTTEN IN SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ADDING DEBT IT WOULD BE NICE TO SEE WHERE BALLOT SHE LOOKS LIKE. THANK YOU MANAGER. AND ANSWER MORE LIKE I JUST WANT ALSO REITERATE AS I. TOOK ANOTHER LOOK AT MY NOW OFFICE THIS ALSO THE POINT OF THE TRAILER BILL IS TO. SET UP THE PLANT NOT THE PROGRAM ITSELF BUT I THINK THE EXPECTATION IS TO THIS PLAN SOME OF THE RESEARCH. AND CLARIFICATION YOU'RE SEEKING SHOULD BE IDENTIFIED THROUGH THE PROCESS THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU MANAGER. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS ON THIS BILL SENATOR NIELSEN. PART OF THE FINANCE THE NEPA EXTENSION THE THIRTY HERE- SEEMS LIKE A- AREAS TIMING. SEEMS LIKE MORE OF A- POLICY ISSUE THAN A BUDGET ISSUE AND I'M GONNA RAISE CONCERNS ABOUT THE SINGLE SUBJECT ISSUE AS WELL AN APPROPRIATE POINT IN THE FUTURE. BUT WHAT WHAT WHAT WOULD BE THE REASON FOR THIS NEPA PROVISION IN HERE SPECIFICALLY. AND AGAIN WHAT IS THE URGENCY OF ACCOMPLISHING THIS IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS. YES THIS IS MARTIN WROTE THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND SO WE NEED TO DELEGATION CAN HAVE A LONG HISTORY- WITH THE STATE WHERE THE- BECAUSE THE STATE HAS THE STATE'S SEQUEL PROCESS IS SO ROBUST- THERE'S A LOT OF DUPLICATION AND WE THE STATE ITSELF DOES MORE THAN IS REQUIRED FOR. FOR THE NEED TO WORK SO- THIS IS BEN- THE NORM AND FOR- PROBABLY PROJECTS FOR AT LEAST THE LAST FIFTEEN YEARS OR MORE- AND SO IN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT MADE THIS. AN OPTION FOR- TRANSIT PROJECTS- A FEW YEARS AGO AND SO THIS WAS FIRST PUT INTO A LEGISLATION THAT LED TO THE INITIAL AUTHORITY IN STATUTE FOR THIS. EXPIRES JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY ONE SO. THIS IS REALLY JUST A AN EXTRA A WIN YEAR EXTENSION. OF THAT- TO- TO CONTINUE ALLOWING A LOCAL TRANSIT AGENCIES AND- BASICALLY ANYBODY DOING TRANSIT PROJECTS ACROSS THE STATE TO CONTINUE TO HAVE THAT. ACHIEVE THAT BENEFIT WHEN WE DO THE- WHEN WE DO THE DELEGATED ME TO WORK. WE SAVE MONTHS- IF NOT YEAR SOMETIMES ON PROJECTS AND- RESULTING IN PROJECTS SAVINGS SO IT'S JUST IT'S A VERY GOOD POLICY. THIRTY NIELSEN WELL FOR FIRST OF ALL YOU DIDN'T EXPLAIN THE URGENCY AND I'M WONDERING IF THIS DOESN'T HAVE SOME APPLICATION TO THE HIGH SPEED RAIL ISSUE. BECAUSE THERE'S A- THE END OF THE LINE HANGING OUT THERE LOOMING OUT THERE AND THAT COULD BE OF SOME APPLICATION IN THIS. AND AGAIN WHY JUST AT THE END OF THE SESSION KIND OF A RUSH TO DEAL. COULD NOT THIS BEEN DEALT WITH OVER A MUCH LONGER PERIOD OF TIME AND PREPARATION. YES I MEAN THE REASON FOR THE REASON THAT IT NEEDS TO BE DONE NOW- IS AS I MENTIONED BEFORE THAT JANUARY ONE TWENTY TWENTY ONE DEADLINE. AND SO- BURKE THE EXPIRATION OF OUR THIRTY TO CONTINUE DOING THAT- THERE YOU KNOW IT'S JUST BUDGET COULD HAVE BEEN ADDRESSED IT BURIES POINTS IN THE PAST BUT WHAT WE'RE ASKING FOR THE EXTENSION NOW- AS STUDENTS SO THAT. SO THE LOCAL TRANSIT AGENCIES AS WELL AS ANY- STATE PROJECTS. CAN CONTINUE TO ACHIEVE THE SAVINGS. AB FURTHER QUESTIONS. ANY QUESTION FOR MY REMOTE PARTICIPANTS SEEN NONE CALLING FROM GONNA- TAKE US TO THE NEXT BILL A. B. EIGHTEEN SIXTY FOUR BUT I'M GOING TO SUGGEST WE TAKE A BRIEF PAUSE FOR DINNER- FOR MEMBERS HERE IN THE CHAMBERS DINNER HAS ARRIVED WE ALSO NEED TO GIVE OUR TECHNICAL SUPPORT FOLKS A BRIEF BREAK THEY HAD BEEN WORKING STRAIGHT THROUGH WHAT THE COMMITTEES THAT WERE GOING THROUGH- AFTER FLOOR SESSION ON THE- ALBUM I'M GOING TO SUGGEST MAYBE TWENTY MINUTES- IT BUT WE WANT TO TAKE A BREAK BECAUSE I KNOW THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE PUBLIC COMMENT AND IT MIGHT RUN QUITE. A BIT OF TIME OKAY SO HOW ABOUT WE- HERE THE PRESENTATION FROM DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE FOR AB EIGHTEEN SIXTY FOUR DEPARTMENT. OF FINANCIAL PROTECTION AND INNOVATION. GOOD EVENING MADAM START YES GOOD EVENING MADAM CHAIR MISTER VICE CHAIR AND SENATOR SO IT IS EVEN NOW I WAS ABOUT TO SAY GOOD AFTERNOON. I'M I'M KIMBERLY HARBISON WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND I WOULD LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR INVITING US. TO DISCUSS THIS PROPOSAL WITH YOU AGAIN TODAY. I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO THANK THE LEGISLATIVE STAFF FOR THEIR TIME AND FEEDBACK AS THEY'VE WORKED WITH US TO REFINE AND IMPROVE THIS PROVOKED PROPOSAL OVER MANY MONTHS THIS YEAR. INCLUDING RESOLUTION OF THE LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT COMPONENTS. WELL THIS PROPOSAL INCLUDES CHANGING THE NAME OF THE DEPARTMENT OF BUSINESS OVERSIGHT TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCIAL PROTECTION AND INNOVATION. IT IS NOT REORGANIZING THE DEPARTMENT OR CREATING A NEW ONE. RATHER IT IS ENHANCING EXISTING REGULATORY FUNCTIONS. AND APPLYING A NAME THAT IS MORE DESCRIPTIVE OTHER FUNCTION AND MORE EASILY UNDERSTOOD BY CONSUMERS AND OTHERS. THE CENTRAL PURPOSE OF THIS BILL IS TO PROTECT CONSUMERS FROM UNLAWFUL UNFAIR DECEPTIVE OR ABUSIVE ACTS ORPRACTICES. AND EXPAND THE DEPARTMENT'S JURISDICTION TO COVER CURRENTLY UNLICENSED PERSONS. THAT OFFER OR PROVIDE CONSUMER FINANCIAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES IN CALIFORNIA. THIS PROPOSAL INCLUDES RESOURCES FOR RESEARCH GREATER COMMUNITY EDUCATION AND OUTREACH AND OMBUDSPERSON FUNCTION AND INNOVATION TECHNOLOGY OFFICE. FOCUSED ON EMERGING AND CHANGING FINANCIAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES IN THE MARKETPLACE. THE TWENTY TWENTY BUDGET ACT INCLUDES FUNDING IN A SET ASIDE ITEM THAT IS NOT YET AVAILABLE TO THE DEPARTMENT OF BUSINESS OVERSIGHT. IT IS CONTINGENT UPON THE LEGISLATURE'S APPROVAL AND THE GOVERNOR'S SIGNATURE OF THIS BILL WITH SUBSEQUENT NOTIFICATION TO THE JOINT- LEGISLATIVE BUDGET COMMITTEE. THE COST OF THE CALIFORNIA CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION LAW PROGRAM WILL BE FUNDED BY NEW COVERED PERSON REGISTRATION FEES. EXISTING IT HUMILIATED SETTLEMENT REVENUES AND EVENTUALLY. YOU SETTLEMENT REVENUES EXISTING LICENSEES ARE NOT EXPECTED TO PAY ANY OF THE COST OF THIS PROGRAM. THIS BILL OUTLINES HOW DEPARTMENTS EXPANDED OVERSIGHT AUTHORITY WILL FUNCTION CURRENTLY DANIELLE'S REGULATION IS BASED IN LICENSING STATUS. WHEN A CONSUMER HAS A COMPLAINT THE FIRST QUESTION IS WHETHER THAT BUSINESS HAS A LICENSE OR IF THEY SHOULD HAVE A LICENSE. IF THE CONSUMER FINANCIAL BUSINESS DOES NOT FALL WITHIN A PRESCRIPTIVE JUST DEFINITION IN STATUTE. DVR DOES NOT HAVE JURISDICTION OR ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY OVER THAT AND STATE AND CANNOT TAKE ACTION EVEN IF CONSUMERS ARE BEING HARMED. THIS BILL PROVIDES AUTHORITY FOR THE COMMISSIONER TO REQUIRE CURRENTLY UNLICENSED FINANCIAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO REGISTER WITH THE DEPARTMENT. EXAMPLES OF THESE CURRENTLY UNLICENSED PRODUCTS INCLUDE CREDIT REPAIR AGENCIES THAT COLLECTORS AND INCOME SHARE AGREEMENTS. THE DEPARTMENT WILL BE ABLE TO SUPERVISE THESE NEW COVERED PERSONS TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH CONSUMER LAWS. IT WILL BE ABLE TO ENFORCE THESE LAWS AND LEARN INFORMATION ABOUT CURRENTLY UNREGULATED. AND EMERGENCY AN EMERGENCY NEW EMERGING NEW INDUSTRY STANDARD REGISTRATION. WITH THE KNOWLEDGE GAINED TO REGISTRATION THE LEGISLATURE WILL BE ABLE TO MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS ON WHETHER TO CREATE AND HOW BEST TO STRUCTURE NEW LICENSING PROGRAMS. WE KNOW THAT IN DIFFICULT ECONOMIC TIMES SUCH AS THE ONE WE ARE CURRENTLY EXPERIENCING BAD ACTORS OFTEN PREY ON THOSE IN FINANCIAL DISTRESS. THOSE MOST DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTED INCLUDE PEOPLE OF COLOR NEW CALIFORNIANS LOWS IN UNDER RESOURCED COMMUNITIES STUDENTS AND SENIORS. I WOULD LIKE TO NOTE THAT COMMISSIONER ALVAREZ HAS TESTIFIED IN PREVIOUS HEARINGS THIS MONTH. BUT SINCE THE ONSET OF THE CODE NINETEEN PANDEMIC THIS SPRING DVO HAS RECEIVED A 40% INCREASE IN CALLS AND COMPLAINS AND THOSE ARE JUST THE CONSUMERS. WHO FIGURED OUT HOW TO FIND THEM OF THE TOTAL INCREASES PROBABLY HIGHER. YEAH CHIEF DEPUTY COMMISSIONER CHRIS SCHULTZ IS HERE WITH US TODAY AND AVAILABLE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. I THANK YOU AND THAT CONCLUDES MY TESTIMONY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISS HARBISON MEMBERS ANY QUESTION THIRTY NIELSEN. THANK YOU ABOUT A PRESIDENT OF. TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. I'M ALWAYS WARY OF THE CREATION OF NEW ENTITIES. AND I QUESTION WHETHER THIS IS APPROPRIATE INCLUSION IN A- BUDGET TRAILER BILL. WE HAVE A HISTORY HERE OF CREATING NEW AGENCIES THAT DON'T SOLVE PROBLEMS. THE OFFICE OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY WHICH SINGULAR GREATEST ACCOMPLISHMENT OVER THE YEARS HAS BEEN TO RENAME ITSELF ABOUT TWO OR THREE TIMES. BUT I HAVE NOT. STE ANY FEWER LECH'S IF YOU WILL HONOR BILLIONS OF DOLLARS EXPENDED. THROUGH THIS HI TECH APPLICATION. IN STATE GOVERNMENT WE CONTINUE EVEN RIGHT NOW. TO HAVE PROBLEMS WITH IT. IT APPEARS MORE TO ME THAT YOU PICKED A MORE CONTEMPORARY ISSUE TOO LAFFONT TO GAIN CEDIT FOR CREATING THIS. ENTITY THAT'S GOING TO. TAKE CARE OF ALL THE PROBLEMS. AND BE THE ADVOCATE FOR THE CONSUMERS I GATHER. BUT WHAT WHAT IT IS AGAIN THE URGENCY OF THIS AND WHY IS IT BEING PROPOSED IN THIS BUDGET. SENATOR NELSON THANK IF YOUR QUESTION WE PROPOSE THIS IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET IN JANUARY AND- IT IS SORT OF AT THE END OF THE ENTIRE SPRING PROCESS THAT WE NORMALLY GO THROUGH WITH YOU. WE DON'T SEE THIS AS A NEW DEPARTMENT OR EVERY- RECONSTRUCTION IT'S- WORRY ENHANCING WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF BUSINESS OVERSIGHT. CAN DO WERE AIMING TO GET. THOSE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT FALL THROUGH THE CRACKS RIGHT NOW SO IT THERE I CAN TO WHAT DVO DOES BUT THEY'RE JUST OUTSIDE THE BOUNDARIES OF WHAT THEY CAN ENFORCE. SO THIS IS JUST MERELY ENHANCING WHAT THEY ALREADY DO IT'S GIVING IT A MORE DESCRIPTIVE NAME THAT I THINK IT WILL MAKE IT EASIER FOR FOLKS TO UNDERSTAND WHAT EXACTLY THEY DO FOR PEOPLE. THANK YOU ANY OTHER QUESTIONS BECAUSE WE DISCUSSED THIS ISSUE BEFORE US SENATOR PAN. I THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- I DO WANT TO FIRST OF ALL- PRECEDED MINISTRATION ADDRESSING THE QUESTIONS THAT WE BROUGHT UP AT A PREVIOUS HEARING AND MAKING MODIFICATIONS. I'M CERTAINLY INTERESTED IN HEARING WHAT SOME OF THE STAKEHOLDERS WILL SAME PUBLIC COMMENT ABOUT THIS PROPOSAL. I DO APPRECIATE THAT THE SECTOR MANY. ADJUSTMENTS AND MODIFICATIONS MADE IN RESPONSE TO OUR QUESTIONS. I THINK WHAT ONE OF THINGS THAT'S HELPFUL IS. WOULD BE HELPFUL TO US SAID THE CLARITY WHICH I DID ASK AT THE PREVIOUS HEARING ABOUT- WHO HAS TO REGISTER AND STANDARD THERE'S NOW A- MORE CLARIFIED THRESHOLD SO THAT WE'RE- TRULY TRYING TO CAPTURE THOSE WHO ARE. MORE INVOLVED IN. COMMERCIAL SERVICES- AS I UNDERSTAND THERE'S PERHAPS SOME ISSUE ROUND DEBT COLLECTORS RELATED TO- HELP WHERE THEY ARE IN THE PROCESS OF POTENTIALLY BEING LICENSED AND HOW THAT MIGHT HAPPEN IF YOU HAVE A GROUP THAT'S- GOING TO BE LICENSE SHORTLY. DO THEY FALL OUT ONCE LICENSE KICKS AND- SO THERE'S A FEW ISSUES ARE OUTSTANDING DIED. HOPEFULLY YOU CAN- AND- THAT MIGHT WILL BE ADDRESSED- AS WE MOVE FORWARD THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE QUESTIONS QUESTIONS FROM OUR REMOTE PARTICIPANTS MEMBERS. CENA COLLEAGUES IT'S SIX FORTY ONE I'M GONNA SUGGEST THAT WE TRY OUR BEST TO RETURN BY SEVEN TEN WITH AN EXPECTATION THAT I WILL GAVEL DOWN AT SEVEN FIFTEEN FAIR ENOUGH.

SUBMITTED IN A PHYSICAL COPY. BUT THE LAST PROBABLY COMPONENT IN HIGH RIDGE IS THERE ARE PROVISIONS IN THIS BILL OF RELATIVE TO UC'S CAPITAL OUTLAY PROCESS OF REQUIRING THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. CHIU SUBMIT CERTAIN CERTIFICATIONS- AS A REQUIREMENT FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TO. APPROVE SOME OF THEIR CAPITAL OUTLAY PROJECTS- THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IS NOT IN A POSITION TO SUPPORT THAT LANGUAGE BUT WE UNDERSTAND THAT IT IS IN THE BILL AND IT IT WILL BE MOVING FORWARD.

FOR BY EDITOR MOORLACH AND JESSICA HOME THEY COVER THE K. TWELVE AREA FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- I CAN'T PROVIDE YOU WITH AN EXACT NUMBER OF HOW MANY ARE GOING AT THIS MOMENT WE ACTUALLY DON'T HAVE GREAT DATA ON THAT- BECAUSE OF CODE NINETEEN THAT HAS CREATED FROM PROBABLY ANTICIPATE TO BE ADDITIONAL MOVEMENT OF FAMILY- THROUGHOUT THE STATE- HOWEVER GENERALLY SPEAKING THE MAJORITY OF LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES ARE IN A DECLINING ENROLLMENT ADDITION AND STATEWIDE. ON ABA HAD BEEN DECLINING. YEAR OVER YEAR FOR SEVERAL YEARS NOW. THANK YOU MISS HOMES I'M- I JUST CURIOUS BECAUSE- OF THE MAJORITY OF THOSE THAT HAVE CONTACTED US. HAVE BEEN CONCERNED ABOUT SCHOOL DISTRICTS OR SCHOOLS THAT ARE ACTUALLY GROWING IN ENROLLMENT BUT WE'RE- WE'RE CAPPING THAT. IN THE END I'M I'M STILL SORT OF AT A LOSS AS TO. WHY WE'RE NOT ALLOWING GROWING SCHOOLS. IN CHARTER SCHOOLS TO HAVE THE ADDITIONAL FUNDING. HE SAID EXCELLENT QUESTION- AND ONE THAT REALLY HAD A LOT OF FISCAL DRIVERS BEHIND IT- THERE'S QUITE A BIT THAT WE DON'T KNOW RIGHT NOW ABOUT HOW FAMILIES ARE REACTING TO EDUCATIONALLY REACTING TO COPE IT NINETEEN INCH AND THE REQUIREMENT- THE HEALTH AND SAFETY REQUIREMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN PUT IN PLACE- TO HELP PROTECT CHILDREN AND STAFF AT SCHOOL- BUT WE DO HAVE. FROM ANECDOTAL INFORMATION THAT INDICATES THAT THERE COULD BE QUITE A BIT OF MOVEMENT- STATEWIDE- BETWEEN. DIFFERENT LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES. AT THE PHYSICAL AND OF BAD DURING THIS YEAR- IS THAT BECAUSE WE'RE HOLDING- ALL LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES HARMLESS. BUT BASICALLY WE ARE ENSURING THAT IF THEY HAVE A DROP IN ATTENDANCE. ON THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE- THAT THEY WILL STILL RECEIVE- APPORTIONMENT FUNDING BASED ON THEIR NINETEEN TWENTY AVERAGE DAILY ATTENDANCE EIGHTY EIGHT IF THERE IS MOVEMENT. AMONG STUDENTS BETWEEN ALLEY EIGHT. THAT WILL CREATE SIGNIFICANT GROWTH ON TOP OF THAT HOLD HARMLESS AND BECAUSE WE ARE IN A POSITION RIGHT NOW- AND HAVING ELEVEN BILLION DOLLAR TECH WORLD FOR OUR SCHOOLS IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE WHICH IS JUST AS A REMINDER- THAT WITH THE MAXIMUM AND DEFERRAL AMOUNT THAT WE HAD DURING THE GREAT RECESSION AND THE ACTUALLY BUILT UP OVER SEVERAL YEARS THAT WE'RE GOING STRAIGHT T THAT AMOUNT. ON ANYTHING HERE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE ADDITIONAL COST OF MOVEMENT- BETWEEN SCHOOL AND THAT IT COULD BE SIGNIFICANT DUE TO COOK AT NINETEEN AND THEN CREATE THE NEED FOR SIGNIFICANT INCREASED MOST VIOLENT. THANK YOU MISS HOME I CAN TELL YOU ANECDOTALLY THAT MOTHERS. ARE THAT I HAVE ENCOUNTERED HAVE BEEN IN TWO YEARS. ABOUT WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. ABOUT THEIR- KIDS KIDS EDUCATION. AND HOW ARE THEY GONNA DO THEIR JOBS AND SO IT'S BEEN DIFFICULT AND SO WHEN WE FOR CLOSE ON. ALLOWING CERTAIN CHARTER SCHOOLS TO GROW A LITTLE BIT AS AN OPTION FOR OUR PARENTS BUT IT JUST THE IS COMES OFF AS VERY INSENSITIVE. AND SO I JUST PASS THAT ALONG BASED ON MANY OF THE ENCOUNTERS I'VE HAD. DEALING WITH CONSTITUENTS. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. THANK YOU CENTER MORALE. YES THANK YOU. MA'AM HELLO RIGHT NOW THIS BILL STILL EXCLUDES AS MY FRIEND- THE CENTER FROM ORANGE COUNTY IS THAT EXCLUDES NON CLASSROOM BASED CHARTER SCHOOLS AND SELF I WANT TO MOVE TO A MAN A. B. EIGHTEEN SIXTY FIVE AND THE STRIKE SECTION FOUR THREE FIVE ZERO FIVE C. ONE. SO THOSE CHARTER SCHOOLS CAN BE INCLUDED IN THE FUNDING SIMILAR OTHER SCHOOLS- THIS BODY OF LEGISLATORS SHOULD NOT BE PROMOTING A POLICY THAT SHOWS FAVORITISM- WHAT IT SHOULD BE ONE THAT PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR THE THOUSANDS OF FAMILIES. WHO CHOOSE THE SCHOOLS AND SO I URGE THE REJECTION OF THIS BUDGET TRAILER BILL AND ASK YOU TO PLEASE- ADOPT THE MOTION THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU ARE SENATOR DOLLY. EIGHT THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. SO I WANT TO DISTURB I THINK THIS IS FOR- MISS HOLMES- PERSONAL APOLOGIZE ARE YOU WE GOT THE STUFF NOT TOO LONG AGO AND IT'S- SO IT'S-VERY- LITTLE BIT BAY GONE- DETAIL AT LEAST ON WHAT I'M PROVIDED WITH SO- BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I'VE FACED WITH A- WITH EDUCATION IN MY DISTRICT IS. VERY ROLE AND- SO I HAVE ELEVEN COUNTY SO I REPRESENT THE NORTHEASTERN PART OF THE STATE. AND SOME OF OUR ABILITY TO DISTANCE LEARNERS JUST NOT AVAILABLE BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE FOR- BROADBAND OR HOT SPOTS OR ANY OF THOSE TYPES OF. DISTANCE LEARNING AND WE'VE SEEN YOU KNOW. A DIFFICULT BUT WE DO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BECAUSE WHICH YOU STATED EARLIER ABOUT THE DROP IN ENROLLMENT WE HAVE PLENTY OF SPACE IN OUR SCHOOLS WE HAVE THE ABILITY BILL ACTUALLY. BRING OUR CHILDREN TO OUR SCHOOLS AND TEACH THEM THERE BUT THE ONE THING THAT SETS GUINNESS STIFLE FOR SCHOOL BOARDS IS THAT OF THE LIABILITY AND SO THERE WAS SOME LEGISLATIONPREVIOUSLY THAT WAS AVAILABLE- THEY DIDN'T COME TO FRUITION AND I WAS WONDERING IF THERE'S ANYTHING IN THIS. IN THIS TRAILER BILL WOULD ADDRESS THAT- A LIABILITY ISSUE THAT IS LOOMING AND HOLDING OUR SCHOOL BOARDS- IT KIND OF THE IT I GUESS STATE THEY'RE FEARFUL THAT THEY'RE GONNA GET SUED IF SOME TEACHER HAS A CODE OR CHOPPED CHILD BRINGS COBIT IN- THAT'S VERY UNFORTUNATE BECAUSE WE CAN ACTUALLY BRING THESE KIDS TO OUR SCHOOLS AND- THE TEACHER WHERE THEY CAN'T GET UP. THE SERVICE IS ANY OTHER WAY. BECAUSE THERE'S NO INFRASTRUCTURE AVAILABLE FOR THEM. YES AND SENATOR DOLLY WE HAD HEARD- ABOUT THOSE CONCERNS AS WELL- I DON'T BELIEVE THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE HAS- A POSITION ON THE BILL THAT YOUR YOUR- REFER. BUT THAT DOES HELP. ON EDUCATION COMMITTEE- BUT- I BUT I CAN TELL YOU WITH THAT. AB EIGHTEEN SIXTY FIVE DOES NOT INCLUDE ANY LANGUAGE THAT WOULD LIMIT THE LIABILITY- FOR EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES. CHECKUP AT NINETEEN. THANK YOU SO MUCH I APPRECIATE THAT I JUST WANT ALSO- MENTION THE FACT THAT. THE SAME THING MY OTHER COLLEAGUES IMAGINE IS IT THERE YOU KNOW THE CHARTER SCHOOLS HAVE BEEN DOING DISTANCE LEARNING AND THOSE TYPES OF THINGS FOR MANY YEARS AND THEY'RE VERY. PROFESSIONAL VERY WELL AND- I THINK IT'S UNFORTUNATE THAT THEY DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO BUILD TRANSFER MANY MANY MANY. I WOULD SAY IN THOUSANDS OF. MY CONSTITUENTS WHO ARE TRYING TO GET THEIR CHILDREN- EDUCATED WOULD LIKE TO MOVE TO THAT PLATFORM BUT DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY BECAUSE OF THE FINANCING STRUCTURE AND IN THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION SO. THANK YOU FOR YOUR INPUT AND FOR MY COLLEGE AS WELL. I WOULD SECOND THE MOTION THAT MORALE HAD IF THAT'S APPROPRIATE MADAM CHAIR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- AND WHILE I APPRECIATE THAT TOWARDS THE END OF SESSION- IT FEELS LIKE- ALL OF OUR PROCESS EASIER RATHER TRUNCATED LET ME JUST CLARIFY FOR ALL. BUT THIS TRAILER BILL HAS BEEN IN PRINT SINCE TUESDAY- MATERIALS WERE GIVEN. TO THE MINORITY CAUCUS- I BELIEVE YESTERDAY- AND SO WHILE I APPRECIATE IT'S NOT IDEAL. THE MATERIALS WERE GIVEN IN PROVIDED AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS ON THIS BILL. THANK YOU SEEN NONE LET'S MOVE ON TO AB. EIGHTEEN SIXTY SEVEN PAID SICK FULLY SICK PLEASE FINANCE. YES COULD YOU MENTION MADAM CHAIR OF AYE SURE MEMBERS CHRIS COOK WITH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AB EIGHTEEN SIXTY SEVEN SMALL EMPLOYER FAMILY LEAVE MEDIATION HANDWASHING AND SUPPLEMENTAL PAID SICK LEAVE SO AB EIGHTEEN SIXTY SEVEN CREATES A SMALL EMPLOYER FAMILY LEAVE MEDIATION PILOT PROGRAM. AT THE DEPARTMENT OF FAIR EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING THIS PROGRAM WOULD AUTHORIZES SMALL EMPLOYER OR THE EMPLOYEE TO REQUEST ALL PARTIES PARTICIPATE. IN A DEPARTMENTS MEDIATION PROGRAM. IT WOULD ALSO PROHIBIT AN EMPLOYEE FROM PURSUING PURSUING CIVIL ACTION UNTIL THE MEDIATION IS COMPLETE. THIS PILOT PROGRAM WOULD BE REPEALED ON JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY FOUR AND IS CONTINGENT UPON SB THIRTEEN EIGHTY THREE BEING ENACTED. AB EIGHTEEN SIXTY SEVEN ALSO PROVIDES THAT FOOD EMPLOYEES WORKING AND ANY FOOD FACILITY SHALL BE PERMITTED TO WASH THEIR HANDS EVERY THIRTY MINUTES AND ADDITIONALLY AS NEEDED. AB EIGHTEEN SIXTY SEVEN PROVIDES SUPPLEMENTAL PAID SICK LEAVE. THE CIVICALLY THE BILL FILLS THE GAPS IN PAID SICK LEAVE PROVIDED IN RECENT FEDERAL LAW AND THE GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE ORDER BY ESTABLISHING COBIT NINETEEN FOOD SECTOR SUPPLEMENTAL PAID SICK LEAVE FOR FOOD SECTOR WORKERS AS PRESCRIBED. ESTABLISHES SUPPLEMENTAL PAID SICK LEAVE FOR BUSINESSES WITH OVER FIVE HUNDRED EMPLOYEES. PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTOR FIRST RESPONDERS AND HEALTH CARE WORKERS EXEMPTED BY FEDERAL LAW IN THE RECENT FEDERAL LAW. ON THE SUPPLEMENTAL PAID SICK LEAVE CONFORMS WITH THE RECENT- FEDERAL SUNSET DATE DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY. DECEMBER YEAH AND- STATES THAT THE LABOR COMMISSIONER SHALL ENFORCE THE COSBY NINETEEN FOOD SECTOR SUPPLEMENTAL PAID SICK LEAVE PROVISIONS AS PRESCRIBED. FINALLY EIGHTY EIGHTEEN SIXTY SEVEN APPROPRIATES A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS IN THE LABOR AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT FUNDS FOR THE LABOR COMMISSIONER TO DO THE WORK FOR THE ENFORCEMENT. WITH THAT I'M AVAILABLE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS ON THE COMMITTEE MAY HAVE. AND THANK YOU QUESTIONS MEMBERS. SENATOR DORADO MANAGERS THIS I JUST WANNA MAKE A COMMENT I DON'T HAVE A QUESTION OF COURSE IS THE TIME OKAY YEAH I WANTED TO SPEAK IN IN SUPPORT OF THE SMALL EMPLOYER FAMILY LEAVE MEDIATION PILOT PROGRAM. IT SHOULD TAKE AFFECT- ONE SENATOR JACKSON'S FAMILY. LEAVE BILL BECOMES LAW THAT'S S. B. THIRTEEN EIGHTY THREE. I DO BELIEVE THAT A LOT OF THE OPPOSITION- HAS OVERSTATED THE CONCERNS ABOUT LITIGATION EVERY TIME WE'VE EXPANDED JOB PROTECTION UNDER THE CALIFORNIA FAMILY RIGHTS ACT. OF THE SORT OF CLAIMS THAT THE SKY IS FALLING ABOUT LITIGATION HAVE NOT BEEN BORN OUT. FAMILIES WANT TIME TO CARE FOR THE SICK LOVED ONES. THEY'RE NOT LOOKING FOR LAWSUITS THIS MEDIATION PILOT PROGRAM REPRESENTS AN ATTEMPT TO PROVIDE A FREE AND A ONE OF A KIND FORM. THROUGH THE DEPARTMENT OF FAIR EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING FOR RESOLVING DISPUTES AND WHAT COULD BE INADVERTENT MISUNDERSTANDINGS WITH EMPLOYERS AND EMPLOYEES. IT IS A CREATIVE CREATIVE AND MEANINGFUL OPTION TO PREVENT DISPUTES FROM ESCALATING- MOST OF ALL IT REPRESENTS AN ATTEMPT TO MAKE FAMILY WORK FOR SMALL EMPLOYERS. I'M FINE I JUST WANNA ALSO EXPRESSED SUPPORT FOR THE SUPPLEMENTAL SICKLY SICK LEAVE AS DESCRIBED THANK YOU MANAGER THANK YOU. SENATOR MORE LAW. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. WHAT TO WEAR WHEN I GO TO FIND THE DEFINITION OF WHAT IS A BUDGET TRAILER BILL IS IT YOU CAN IT JUST BE FOR A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR. THE LABOR COMMISSIONER IS THAT IS THAT WHAT MAKES THIS A BUDGET BILL OR. IS SHOULDN'T THIS BE A POLICY BILL. THREE TO MORE LOCK- THE BUDGET BILL ITSELF WHICH IS ALWAYS HUNDREDS OF PAGES WHEN YOU OPEN IT IT. IS FILLED WITH CODE SECTION AND LOTS OF DOLLAR AMOUNTS UNTIL THE WAY I'VE OFTEN DESCRIBED IN UNDERSTOOD IT MYSELF. FOR MANY YEARS NOW IS THE BUDGET BILL ITSELF. IS THE WHAT AND THE TRAILER BILLS ARE THE HOW IS HOW THE DOLLARS ARE TO BE APPROPRIATED SO WHAT'S THE PROGRAMMATIC. EXPLANATION OF WHY AND HOW WE'RE SPENDING THE MONEY. AND SO I THINK WE OFTEN HAVE DISCUSSION AND DEBATE ABOUT PERCEPTION ABOUT WHAT CONSTITUTES A TRAILER BILL VERSUS WHAT CONSTITUTES A POLICY BILL- AND THAT WILL PROBABLY CONTINUE TO BE UP FOR DEBATE. WE OFTEN HAVE DEBATE ABOUT WHETHER. SOMETHING IS MET THE SINGLE SUBJECT RULE IN A TRAILER BILL I THINK I REFERENCED EARLIER WHEN THE QUESTION WAS RAISED BECAUSE THE TRAILER BILL FOCUSED ON ONE DEPARTMENT. WE DEEMED IT APPROPRIATE ABSENT THAT I THINK THAT'S ABOUT THE BEST. ANSWER I CAN GIVE YOU THIS EVENING. YEAH JUST CALLING BALLS SIR. YOU KNOW HAVING AN UMPIRE OR REFEREE JUST KIND OF WONDER WHERE THAT. RULES ARE SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND EXPLANATION MESSENGER HAPPY TO SENATOR LABEL. BERENBERG METABOLIC CHARGES ONE TO HELP OUT A LITTLE BIT AS WELL IF YOU GOOGLE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TRAILER BUDGET JUST TREAT GOOGLE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE IT GIVES YOU AN EXPLANATION AND THE DEFINITION OF WHAT TRAILER BILL LANGUAGES. YOU ACTUALLY COVER TO PERFECTLY MATCH CHU THANK YOU GOING TO SAY DON'T READ IF I WAS CENTER LEYVA THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR HELPING US IDENTIFY THAT. THAT RESOURCE SENATOR NIELSEN I SEE YOUR PAL SIR YES. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR WELL ON THIS PARTICULAR POINT I RAISED CONCERNS ABOUT IT LITERALLY EVERY YEAR AND TRAILER BILL PROCESSES IN MY OPINION GOTTEN COMPLETELY OUT OF CONTROL. THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO QUESTION THAT SOME OF THESE TRAILER BILLS INCLUDING THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH TODAY TONIGHT TOMORROW. OUR POLICY. NOT NECESSARY TO IMPLEMENT THE PROVISIONS OF THE BUDGET AND THAT WAS THE OLD TIME. DEFINITION FOR THE TRAILER BILL. AND I AM GOING TO OBJECT TO SOME OF THESE BILLS AT LEAST FOR THE RECORD FOR THE HOPE OF SOMEDAY WE WILL HAVE MITIGATION. THAT PRECLUDES THESE EXCESSES AT THE INTERSECTION. OF MAJOR POLICY WE'VE GOT A WHOLE NEW AGENCY CREATED HERE. AT THE END OF SESSION. AND THAT THE NECESSARY TO IMPLEMENT THE BRIDGE THE BUDGET WELL ONLY IF YOU SAY WELL IT WAS INTRODUCED IN JANUARY. WELL THEN LET'S GO THROUGH THE PROCESS AND FOR THE CREATION OF A NEW AGENCY THERE IS A PROCESS WHEREBY L. A. OLD REVIEWS IT. AND THE LITTLE HOOVER COMMISSION. I USED ON WHICH I SET. WE'VE NEVER HAD ANY DISCUSSION OF THIS QUOTE NEW AGENCY. TO MY KNOWLEDGE A LITTLE HOOVER COMMISSION. SO LET'S GET BACK TO PROCESS AND I WILL CONTINUE TO OBJECT TO THE EXCESSIVE TRAILER. I APPRECIATE THAT SIR AND I WILL READ ONE ADDITIONAL SENTENCE- BECAUSE I THINK YOU KNOW IN MANY INSTANCES IS UP TO INTERPRETATION AND I THINK YOU KNOW THE USES. PERHAPS A CHANGE OVER THE YEARS QUITE FRANKLY BUT A TRAILER BILL OF THE BILL THAT MAKE STATUTORY CHANGES RELATED TO THE BUDGET. AND SO WHILE WE TEND TO HARP ON WHETHER TRAILER BILL TO TRAILER BILL YOU KNOW I GUESS PERHAPS THE BIGGER QUESTION IS IT APPROPRIATE TO MAKE THE STRUCTURAL CHANGES IN THE BUDGET. BECAUSE THE TRAILER BILLS ARE MERELY RESPONDING TO THE STRUCTURAL CHANGES THAT WE PROPOSED IN THE BUDGET ITSELF AND SO YOU KNOW PERHAPS THAT SHOULD BE THE BIGGER ARGUMENT- THAT WE SHOULD. BRING FORWARD. WHAT THAT ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS ON THIS TRAILER BILL. THIRTY NIELSEN WHAT MADAM CHAIR ON THIS VERY THIS PARTICULAR BILL CAN SOMEONE TELL ME WHAT PROVISIONS IN THIS BILL OUR NATIONAL. TO THE BUDGET. YES THERE IS MONEY IN THE BUDGET BILL JUNIOR DEALING WITH PAID SICK LEAVE EDUCATION M. LABOR ENFORCEMENT. AND SO THERE IS AN ALLOCATION THIRTY TWO POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS GENERAL FUND. THAT'S WHAT'S IN THE BUDGET THAT REQUIRES ACTION TO BE TAKEN. I STILL OBJECT FAIR ENOUGH ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. SENATOR MELENDEZ. I THANK YOU MADAM CHAIRWOMAN I JUST WANT TO FIND OUT IF SENATOR MORALE I BELIEVE MADE A MOTION- ARE WE VOTING ON THAT MOTION. AS I STATED AT THE TOP OF THE HEARING SENATOR MELINDA'S ALL THE MOTIONS WILL BE TAKEN. AT THE END OF THE HEARING AFTER WE HEAR ALL PUBLIC COMMENT. OKAY THANK YOU IF HE CHOOSES TO MAKE THAT MOTION AGAIN AT THAT POINT IT CAN BE ADDRESSED. OF THE LAST SEVERAL BUDGET HEARINGS THAT'S WHAT WE'VE DONE WE'VE HEARD ALL THE TESTIMONY WE'VE TAKEN PUBLIC COMMENT AT THE END AND WE GO FOR ONLY ABOUT. A SOMETHING WE'VE DONE THE LAST MAYBE THREE HEARING. ANY OF QUESTIONS BEFORE WE ON. IT SEEN NONE LET'S MOVE ON TO AB EIGHTEEN SIXTY EIGHT JUVENILE JUSTICE REALIGNMENT FINANCE. KERN COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ASSEMBLY BILL EIGHTEEN SIXTY EIGHT REALIGNED THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR YOU CURRENTLY ELIGIBLE TO GO TO THE DIVISION OF JUVENILE JUSTICE TO COUNTENANCE. THIS BUDGET TRAILER BILL CLOSES AND TAKE TO THE DIVISION OF JUVENILE JUSTICE BEGINNING JULY TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUT ALLOW CERTAIN YEARS TO STILL COME TO DJJ WHILE CHANGES ARE BEING IMPLEMENTED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. IT RAISES THE AGE OF JURISDICTION TO MAX T. J. J'S FOR THE REALIGN POPULATION. INCLUDES INTENT LANGUAGE TO ESTABLISH AN ALTERNATIVE DISPOSITIONAL TRACK BY MARCH TWENTY TWENTY ONE TO PREVENT YOU FROM BEING SENT TO ADULT COURT. RELATED TO FINDING THE BILL PROVIDES TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS PER ESTIMATED YOU AND A MINIMUM OF TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS PER COUNTY. THIS CALL YEARS TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO THREE TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR IN THE FUNDING IS DISTRIBUTED BY COUNTY BASED ON 50% OF THE POPULATION. JUDICATA FOR CRIMES LISTED IN WEEK SEVEN OH SEVEN B. AND PENAL CODE TWO NINE ZERO POINT ZERO ZERO AND- 30% BASED ON DJJ YOUTH STAGE IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN AND TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN. AND 20% BASED ON COUNTY POPULATION AGES AND THREE SEVENTEEN. IT REQUIRES THE GOVERNOR AND LEGISLATURE TO ADJUST THE BITE COUNTY FUNDING FORMULA DISTRIBUTION BY JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY FOUR TO IMPROVE OUTCOMES FOR THIS POPULATION. PROVIDES NINE POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS ON A ONE TIME BASIS FOR FACILITY IMPROVEMENTS AND PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT FOR THE REAL LINE POPULATION. TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR FINDING EACH COUNTY WILL BE REQUIRED TO ESTABLISH A JUVENILE ADVISORY BODY THAT DEVELOPS AND IMPLEMENTS A JUVENILE JUSTICE REALIGNMENT PLAN HAS SPECIFIED. THE BILL ESTABLISHES THE OFFICE OF YOUTH AND COMMUNITY RESTORATION WITHIN THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY EFFECTIVE JULY TWENTY TWENTY ONE. HOUSING THE OFFICE WITHIN THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY WILL PROVIDE A CONNECTION IN UNIFIED APPROACH BETWEEN THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM AND THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM. THE OFFICE WILL IDENTIFY AND DEVELOP POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPROVED OUTCOMES- PROVIDE TARGETED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE IDENTIFYING DISSEMINATE BEST PRACTICES. COLLECTING CHECK FOR COMPLETION OF THE COUNTY JUVENILE JUSTICE REALIGNMENT PLANS.

CONSCIENCE ARE MOVED TO THE NEW OFFICE BY JANUARYTWENTY TWENTY FIVE. INCLUDES A NEW STATE LEVEL ON BY ADMIN. FOR YOUTH IN THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM AND HER HAS THE OFFICE CA OF ON THAT OF LOCAL PROGRAMS BEING YOU KNOW IN THE LINE. POPULATION THE BILL ALSO CONTINUES THE WORK OF THE YOUTH JUSTICE COMMITTEE WITHIN THE CHILD WELFARE COUNCIL UNTIL JULY TWENTY TWENTY THREE. AND REQUIRES THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE TO SUBMIT A PLAN BY JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY THREE TO UPDATE THE JUVENILE COURT AND PROBATION STATISTICAL SYSTEM DATABASE. WHICH WILL DETAIL HOW TO IMPROVE AND MODERNIZE STATEWIDE JUVENILE JUSTICE DATA COLLECTION REPORTING. BACK INCLUDES ALL THE DETAILS OF THE BILLS I'M JUST GOING TO SAY WE APPRECIATE ALL THE DISCUSSION HARD WORK WAS COMPLETED THE LEGISLATURE AND STAKEHOLDERS ON THIS PROPOSAL AND I'M AVAILABLE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU QUESTIONS MEMBERS. THIRTY MCGUIRE. THANK YOU SO MUCH MADAM CHAIR I DO KNOW THAT THERE'S BEEN AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF DIALOGUE THAT HAS GONE INTO THIS CRITICAL ISSUE- IN MY FOCUS ON FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IS THE ISSUE OF RURAL COUNTIES. ONE OF THE ITEMS THAT I THINK RURAL COUNTIES ONE OF FOCUSING ON IS A NON ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH. IN I THINK ON THE MERITS OF THIS BILL- ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL TO BE ABLE TO ADVANCE. BUT I'D LIKE TO BE A TO ASK ABOUT THE ALLOCATION FORMULA WITHIN THE BILL. IN THE FACT THAT. WHAT WE JUST HEARD IS THAT ALL COUNTIES RECEIVED THAT TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THE- PER. IF THIS IS DAY ONE CONFIRM THAT THAT IS ABSOLUTELY TRUE NUMBER ONE. NUMBER TWO HOW CAN WE EXPECT COUNTIES TO PROVIDE ADEQUATE PROGRAMS AND SERVICES PARTICULARLY IF THOSE WHO RELIED ON DJ ARE DISADVANTAGED. UNDER THE FORMULA I'M GONNA ONE EXAM MADAM CHAIR AND I'LL TURN IT OVER TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TO YOU. DEALER COUNTY INCREDIBLY SMALL COUNT PROXY TWENTY SIX THOUSAND. THERE BUDGET YEAR TO YEAR IS INCREDIBLY TIGHT BUT ESPECIALLY NOW UNDER THE ISSUE OF CODE. SO WHILE THEY WANT TO STEP UP TO DO THE RIGHT THING AT TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS PER USE IT IS GOING TO BE ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL THAT THAT MONEY IS GUARANTEED TO SUCH A SMALL COUNTY. WHO WANT TO BE ABLE TO DO THE RIGHT THING ON BEHALF OF THEIR YOUTH. SO I WANT TO GET A GUARANTEE HERE FROM DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. IF THIS TORRENT TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND PER USE. IS SOLID WITHIN THE BUDGET. THE OVERALL ALLOCATION IS BASED ON TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS PER USE. AT THE STATEWIDE LEVEL PLUS THE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLAR MINIMUM. THAT BY COUNTY DISTRIBUTION IS. BASED ON THOSE THREE FACTORS I DESCRIBE 50% BASED ON YOU'D BETTER EDUCATED. FOR CRIMES AND WAIT SEVEN OH SEVEN BEING PENAL CODE TWO NINE ZERO POINT ZERO ZERO EIGHT. 30% BASED ON THE JJ'S USAGE IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN. AND 20% BASED ON THE COUNTY'S. YOUTH POPULATION TOTALS- SO I GUESS IN RESPONSE TO YOUR THE QUESTION HERE IS THAT- THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF USERS THAT ARE ACTUALLY ELIGIBLE TO GO TO DJJ TODAY. I DON'T END UP COMING TO DJJ- IN THE FORMULA WEIGHTS THAT CATEGORY THE HIGHEST IN SOME WAY TO REFLECT THAT AND WE WANT TO PROVIDE COUNTY'S MONEY TO DEAL WITH THAT. ENTIRE POPULATION- AND SO LOOKING FORWARD FOR COUNTIES THAT ARE HIGHER OR HIGHER YOU LATER SERVERS AND DJJ ON THAT POPULATION. I MEAN THEY NEED TO DO SOMETHING DIFFERENTLY WITH THE FOLKS MAYBE THEY'RE INCARCERATING LOCALLY- TO BE ABLE TO TAKE ON THE ENTIRE NEW. NEED YEAR- BUT IT'S SORT OF A AND IT'S ALSO A LOOKING FORWARD FORMULA THAT REALLY BAD IN SOME WAYS. AND STATES THAT WHAT IT WOULD HAVE SINCE 200-018-2000 NINETEEN IS A REFLECTIVE OF WHAT WILL HAPPEN MOVING FORWARD. MY WHAT ARE AND THAT BIGGER POPULATION OF JUDICATA YOUTH IN THOSE CRIME CATEGORIES I MENTIONED. ARE ACTUALLY A MORE HOLISTIC LOOK AT THE POPULATION THAT ACTUALLY IS BEING REALIGNED. I'M NOT JUST THE ONES THAT WERE ACTUALLY SENT TO DJJ. I THINK THE FRUSTRATION THAT- AND I AGAIN I'LL SPEAK MORE ON. RURAL COUNTIES RURAL COUNTIES RELY ON DJJ MORE THAN URBAN COUNTIES OR EVEN SUBURBAN COUNTIES BECAUSE THERE ARE NO ADDITIONAL RESOURCES WITHIN THE COUNTY. SO THEN WHAT WE'RE GOING TO START DOING IS NOW WE'RE GONNA START LEARNING. ADDITIONAL. AND I GET IT IN ABSOLUTELY AGREE. WITH Y. WE'RE GOING DOWN THIS ROAD IT IS ABSOLUTELY. AFTER FUTURE OF THE- KIDS. IN IT THIS TIME THOUGH NEEDING BE A PER. THE RULE COUNTIES. WHO DO NOT HAVE THE FINANCES TO BE ABLE TO. COMPETE WITH SUBURBAN URBAN COUNTIES THE ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO DO SO. AND I JUST I HAVE SOMECONCERNS ABOUT THIS PROPOSAL IN IF MY LAST QUESTION IS THIS FINAL PROPOSAL THAT'S IN FRONT OF US NOW IN THE SAME PROPOSAL HAS BEEN DISCUSSED. OVER THE PAST MANY WEEKS WITH COUNTIES. THIS FUNDING ALLOCATION WAS ACTUALLY START A PART OF THE LEGISLATIVE- INITIAL PROPOSAL THAT WAS RELEASED AND SENATE BILL EIGHT TWENTY THREE- LAST- I THINK IT WAS LAST WEEK- SO. THAT DON'T BREAK DOWN AS A FIFTY THIRTY TWENTY HAS BEEN OUT THERE AND AVAILABLE FOR SOME TIME- IS A SAMETIME. DISCUSSIONS ABOUT OKAY WHAT PERCENTAGE BREAKDOWN FOUND- COULD BE YEARS- OBVIOUSLY YOU CAN USE VARIOUS FACTORS- AND- WE INCLUDED IT'S KIND OF LIKE A LONG TERM COMMITMENT- REVISITING THE DISTRIBUTION OVER ALL TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S FUNCTIONAL AND HAS IMPROVED OUTCOMES FOR THE POPULATION OVERALL. CAN YOU TELL ME HOW YOU'RE GONNA REVISIT THIS AND EVALUATE. WE DON'T KNOW SPECIFICALLY I THINK THAT'LL BE BASED ON WHAT TAKES PLACE THROUGH IMPLEMENTATION WHAT DATA WERE BEING OUT WILL BE ABLE TO. HAVE BEEN THOSE TYPES OF THINGS SO IT'S A COMMITMENT THAT WERE COMING BACK TO REVISIT THE DISTRIBUTION- STAR IN. TWENTY TWENTY FOUR. THEY CAME TO YOU'RE WELCOME SIR MORLOCK. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. AFTER YOU'RE ELECTED TO COUNTY SUPERVISOR I YOU REALLY GET INVOLVED WITH THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES. PRETTY CRITICAL FOR L. A. COUNTY TO BE A PARTICIPANT IT WAS A REWARDING EXPERIENCE FOR ME TO SERVE ON THEIR BOARD- IN UNDER EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE- I SERVED AS SUPERVISOR WHEN ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER WAS GOVERNOR. I NEVER SAW HIM AS HE'S ACTIVE IN. WHEN GOVERNOR BROWN WAS ELECTED HE WAS ED ARE VERY FOR IT IN THE VERY FIRST THE SECOND MEETING OR GETTING THAT THAT HE COULD ATTEND HE WAS THERE AND- WE HAD A GREAT WORKING RELATIONSHIP. I DO NOT KNOW BECAUSE I JUST DON'T KNOW- IF GOVERNOR NEWSOM HAS ATTENDED BECAUSE HE SAID BOARD MEETINGS. I'M I'M- FOR SURE TO ERR MAYBE REASSURED THAT THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF DIALOGUE GOING ON BASED ON WHAT CENTER MCGUIRE YOU SHARED. BUT WHEN I LOOK AT MY- COMMENTARY I'M SEEING C. SACK IN ALL THE COUNTIES OPPOSED INCLUDING CHEAPER. OFFICER'S BALIK COUNTIES OPPOSED TO THIS. REALLY REAL SO I'M CONCERNED THAT MAYBE THERE HASN'T BEEN DIALOGUE SO MR COLUMN CAN YOU. HELP ME OUT HAS BEEN DIALOGUE AND THE SECOND QUESTION IS FORMER STATE SENATOR. GLORIA ROMERO FORMER. DEMOCRATIC MAJORITY LEADER. HER HEART AND SOUL INTO. DEALING WITH THIS PARTICULAR AREA I'M JUST CURIOUS HAVE YOU OR HAS THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE CONSULTED WITH HER ON THIS INITIATIVE. AND THERE HAS BEEN A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF DISCUSSION WITH- THE PROBATION DEPARTMENT'S IN THE COUNTIES ON THIS PROPOSAL- UNFORTUNATELY THEY THEY ARE IN OPPOSITION TO THE AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE ADMINISTRATION THE LEGISLATURE- BUT WE ARE AT. LOOKING FORWARD TO CONTINUING PRODUCTIVE DISCUSSIONS IN THE FUTURE AND REALITY THIS PROPOSAL IS GONNA TAKE- OVER FOUR YEARS TO. RESPOND FERMENTATION INTAKE DOESN'T COLLECT CLOTHES UNTIL JULY TWENTY TWENTY ONE- AND THE REAL WORK BEGINS NOW AND WE DEFINITELY- PLAN TO CONTINUE INCLUDING THEM. IN THEIR CONVERSATION MOVING FORWARD ABOUT HOW TO MAKE THIS A SUCCESSFUL TRANSITION. THANK YOU HAVE A GLORIA ROMERO SHE BEEN CONTACTED. I'LL HAVE TO GET BACK TO YOU ON GLORIA AYE I HAVE NOT PERSONALLY SPOKE WITH HER WE SHOULD BE A GREAT RESOURCE THANK YOU MISTER CULLEN THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. THANK YOU FOR MORE LIKE IT'S NOT APPROPRIATE THIS PLACE FOR ME TO TALK ABOUT YOU KNOW CAMPAIGN RELATED THINGS BUT I'LL BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO TALK WITH YOU ABOUT THAT. OFF STATE PROPERTY. MOVING ON. TO MANAGER- JUST MAKING A PREDICTION I DON'T THINK I WAS TALKING ABOUT. OKAY I WOULD SEE THE VIEW FROM THE RAW. THANK YOU MANAGER JUST TO PIGGYBACK ON WHAT MY COLLEAGUE FROM THE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WAS ASKING ABOUT. I DON'T KNOW I PREFER CONFESS THAT I DON'T KNOW A LOT ABOUT THE SERIOUS SO IF MY QUESTION MAKES NO SENSE. I HOPE YOU WILL TELL ME. IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT IN THE PAST OVER TIME SOME COUNTIES HAVE DEVELOPED MORE MATURE AND ROBUST PROGRAMS FOR DEALING WITH THESE. SEVEN OF SEVENTY JUVENILES. AND OTHER COUNTIES HAVE REFERRED MORE. T. DJJ WHICH I THINK YOU REFERENCED. UNDER THIS PLAN IN MY TO UNDERSTAND THAT THERE MAY THEN BE SOME FUNDING. DISPARITY BETWEEN TWO WERE MORE ROOM LOCAL PROGRAMS. AND COUNTIES WHO NO LONGER HAVE DJJ. TO REFER THE SEVEN OH SEVEN BE JUVENILES. TO FINALLY I THINK AS I DESCRIBED IT IS THAT IT WILL TAKE INTO ACCOUNT- THE BIGGEST PORTION WILL TAKE INTO ACCOUNT ALL THOSE WHO ARE ELIGIBLE TO GO TO DJJ EVEN IF THEY JOBS GO- IN OUT. I THINK SOME OF THAT MAY COME FROM COUNTY IS CERTAIN COUNTIES HAVING BETTER PROGRAMS IT MAY COME FROM CERTAIN COUNTIES- PREFERRING A CERTAIN. TYPE OF- ADJUDICATION OR- DISPOSITION TRACK FOR UNIVERSITY IS MAYBE AN ALTERNATE PROGRAM THAT DOESN'T INCLUDE GOING TO DJJ SO I THINK MOVING FORWARD. COUNTY UNDER MOTTO I THINK IT'S GOING TO HAVE- COUNTY IS THAT MAYBE HAVE BEEN SENDING MORE USED TO DJJ TO I'M CONSIDER FACTORS TO DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT WITH THE POPULATION BUT THEY WERE KEEPING. YOU KNOW AS A HYPOTHETICAL EXAMPLE MAYBE THEY WERE I'M KEEPING MORE USE THAN THEIR HALLS WHERE DOES THE INTERNET IS SIMILAR YOU HAVE BEEN A DIFFERENT COUNTY MAY HAVE RECEIVED OUTPATIENT. TREATMENT OR SOMETHING ELSE IN THAT MANNER SO- WHICH IS LESS EXPENSIVE THAN BEING- HOLDING SOMEONE OF THE STABILITY SO I MEAN AGAIN THAT'S A HYPOTHETICAL HERE BUT I NEED TO SORT OF GIVE YOU THE START OF. CONCEPTUALIZED PROBABLY NEED TAKE PLACE BASED ON THAT AND HOW THAT KIND OF LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD. AND THAT SORT OF. THE TOWN IS ALSO A YOU AREN'T YOU SEPARATE AND ENDED. OR AND OR- FOR- ACTIVITIES WERE ONE OF THE LABOR THIS. YEAR LOOK AT A GUY WHO SPENT SIX YEARS DOING IT PROJECTS NOT. PUBLIC SAFETY SO. WHEN THE LIGHT SWITCH IS FLIPPED AND WE GO FROM WHAT WE HAVE TODAY TO WHAT YOU'RE PROPOSING. WELL RIVERSIDE COUNTY FOR EXAMPLE RECEIVE MORE MONEY LESS MONEY OR THE SAME MONEY. RIVERSIDE COUNTY BEING A COUNTY THAT REFERRED MORE JUVENILES TO DJJ SEVEN SEVEN BEES. THEN THE COUNTY CAPT AND LOCAL PROGRAMS. IS THAT A QUESTION YES SORRY I WAS I WAS LOOKING AT MY CHART TO SIGN RIVERSIDE COUNTY YEAH ES THEY WOULD GET US A SLIGHTLY SOMETHING SMALLER AMOUNT THAN IF WE JUST BASED ON. DIVISION OF JUVENILE JUSTICE OVERHAUL OUR NATION'S PROBABLY TAKE BACK SLIGHTLY SMALLER IT WOULD BE TWO POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS IN TWENTY ONE TWENTY ZERO IF WE JUST USE ONLY DJJ AS A FACTOR. AND IT WOULD BE ABOUT TWO POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS IF WE USE- THE FACTORS AS LAID OUT IN THE TRAILER BILL. OKAY AND I UNDERSTAND I UNDERSTAND THE. INCENTIVE PROGRAM IS WORKING HERE. SO MY NEXT QUESTION. IS THERE A PLAN TO CREATE A PATH TO HELP THOSE COUNTIES WHO. NEED HELP TO DEVELOP. MORE MATURE AND ROBUST LOCAL PROGRAMS TO DEAL WITH THESE SEVEN SEVEN B. IS THERE SOME BREADCRUMB APPROACH TO INCENTIVIZE THE COUNTIES AND HELP THEM. EXPAND THE LOCAL PROGRAMS THAT WE'RE TRYING TO GET THEM TO EXPAND TO DEAL WITH JUVENILES. YEAH I THINK THERE'S AND FOR THOSE BUT IT WILL NOT ENTITLED TO MONEY SO MONEY A MONETARY PLAN RIGHT IT'S SO EASY THE TRAILER BILL APPROPRIATES NINE POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS TO ASSIST COUNTIES MUST START OF FUNDS SO THAT COULD BE FACILITY UPGRADES I CAN BE PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT. AND I THINK THAT'S ONE CRITICAL AREA WHERE SOME OF THESE COUNTIES THAT DON'T HAVE THOSE PROGRAMS DEVELOPS AND- DO THAT- AND THEN SECONDARILY TO I THINK I WOULD POINT OUT THAT THIS IS NOT WHERE THE STATE WILL START SENDING THEIR U. AS A MEDIA LEAST. YOU'D BETTER IN THE IN THE COUNTY MEANS JULY ONE IT WILL BE. YEAH WILL NO LONGER BE A SENTENCING OPTION EXCEPT FOR CERTAIN YOU. I'M IMMEDIATELY IN JULY TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND THEREFORE THERE THE SENATE A SLOW INCREASE TO A COUNTY IT HAD TO TAKE OVER THIS POPULATIONS OVER THE NEXT TEN MONTHS WITH THAT NINE POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS. AND THEN HAVING THE TIME TO SORT OF PLAN FOR THAT- THAT. THE PLANE THE HOPE IS THAT THOSE COUNTIES WILL BE ABLE TO SORT OF. EITHER BUILD UP THE CAPACITY THEMSELVES OR SORT OF REGIONALLY FIGURE OUT WHICH COMPANIES CAN DO Y. AND SORT OF LOOK AT YOU KNOW MAYBE ONE COUNTY DOES MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT ONE TO SEX OFFENDER TREATMENT. AND SORT OF BUILD THOSE RELATIONSHIPS AND TO PROVIDE THE SERVICES NEEDED FOR THE USED TO HAVE IF IT IF IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE FOR OR COUNTY TO HAVE THAT DEDICATED. PROGRAM SO. I'M I'M A LITTLE BIT HANDICAP BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW THE LANDSCAPE WHICH BUT YOU KNOW THE LANDSCAPE OF THE COUNTIES THAT ARE IMPACTED IN THIS FASHION SO. GIVEN THE LANDSCAPE WHICH YOU KNOW. DO YOU THINK THE NINE POINT WHATEVER IT WAS MILLION. IS SUFFICIENT TO ALLOW THOSE COUNTIES THAT ARE IMPACTED TO. BUILD UP THE LOCAL PROGRAMS NECESSARY. TO ATTRACT THE ADDITIONAL FUNDING NECESSARY. TO PROPERLY. A DEALER FOR A TREAT. AND REHABILITATE THE JUVENILES WERE TALKING ABOUT. YEAH I HONESTLY I DON'T HAVE A FULL ANSWER ON WHETHER IN THE SUFFICIENCY ABOUT FINDING WILL BE ABLE TO ALLOW EVERY COUNTY TO DEVELOP EVERY PROGRAM- AND IMMEDIATELY I. CAN SAY THAT YOU KNOW OUR CONVERSATIONS ALL N HAVE INCLUDED THAT AS THE START UP SIGNS- AND I'M SURE. BOOKS WOULD ALWAYS LIKE MORE BUT- THAT WASN'T AN AREA- BIG DISCUSSION BETWEEN THE PARTIES THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS- AND SO- YOU KNOW OUR HOPES IS THAT IT IS SUFFICIENT AND IN COMBINATION WITH MORE TIME. AND OR OR COUNTIES TO KIND OF BUILD THIS SLOWLY AS AND THEY'RE NOT GOING TO IMMEDIATELY HAVE A HUNDRED YEARS THAT THEY DIDN'T OTHERWISE HAVE ON JULY WIND IT'LL BE SORT OF THE SLOW GROWTH INTO THAT PROGRAM OVER TIME. WHAT I HOPE YOU'LL CONTINUE TO LOOK AT THIS AS WE MOVE INTO THE- TO THE NEXT BUDGET YEAR AND I APPRECIATE YOUR RESPONSES AND- FRANKLY THANK YOU FOR PUTTING UP WITH MY QUESTIONS IN AN AREA THAT I'M NOT PARTICULARLY. FAMILIAR WITH SO THANK YOU MANAGER. OF COURSE SENATORS COMING YEAR. THANK YOU FOR MUCH MADAM CHAIR AND THANK YOU FOR- THE QUESTION SO FAR. I GUESS THE ISSUE FOR ME IS THAT. MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THIS IS KIND OF A COMPROMISE. PROPOSAL THAT THAT TAKES A LITTLE BIT OF FROM WHAT THE GOVERNOR HAD PROPOSED- IN HIS. EITHER IN HIS JANUARY BUDGET OR MAY REVISED AND- SOME INTEREST THAT THE LEGISLATURE HADN'T I GUESS I GUESS IT AND YOU SAID YOU INDICATED THAT. THE COUNTIES WERE AT THE TABLE. AND ARE AWARE OF THIS PROPOSAL AND WE'RE NEGOTIATING AND I MY PHONE'S BEEN BLOWING UP TODAY THEN MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE WE'RE WE'RE TRYING TO DO. BUDGET AT THE SAME TIME THAT WE'RE FINISHING UP BILLS AND SO EVERYBODY THINKS EVERYTHING'S BEEN PUT TOGETHER AT THE LAST MINUTE OR MAYBE IT HAS BEEN BUT- THE COUNTIES ARE TELLING ME THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THEY HAVEN'T SEEN BEFORE THAT THEY'RE NOT PREPARED. TO BE ABLE TO IMPLEMENT. THIS AS QUICKLY AS BOB IS AS IT IS IN THE BUDGET AND THAT THAT THEY JUST DON'T HAVE THE CAPACITY TO DO THIS RIGHT NOW AND IT HAS NOT BEEN PART. THAT THEY HAVEN'T BEEN AT THE TABLE NEGOTIATING THIS SO I AM CONCERNED CAN YOU TALK TO US A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT BECAUSE- I'M- WE DID THIS BEFORE. WHEN WE TOOK A AT A WHOLE CATEGORY OF INDIVIDUALS THAT WOULD NORMALLY GO TO STATE PRISON WE SENT THEM TO THE COUNTY. AND I THINK THAT'S- WITH SOME EXCEPTIONS HAS BEEN A SUCCESS. BUT WE ALSO SEND A LOT OF MONEY AND SO I'M WONDERING WHY ARE THE COUNTIES CALLING ME SAYING WHAT THE F. AND THE- PROBATION CHIEFS IN PARTICULAR SAYING THAT THEY HAVEN'T BEEN AT THE TABLE THIS IS NOT PART OF WHAT THEY- WOULD HAVE AGREED. TO SO ADD THIS THERE HAS BEEN- AS I SAID STATED PREVIOUSLY TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF DISCUSSION WITH THE COUNTY IS ON THE PROPOSAL OF REALIGNING- THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THESE USED TO THEM AND- THE FINAL AGREEMENT EACH YEAR BEFORE YOU TODAY IS AN AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE LEGISLATURE. UNFORTUNATELY THERE ARE DETAILS IN HERE THAT THEY ARE NOT IN FULL AGREEMENT AND- WHICH IS PROBABLY WHY YOU'RE HEARING FROM THEM- SO IT YOU KNOW I THINK OVERALL WE DID OUR BEST TO INCORPORATE- INPUT FROM MULTIPLE SITES- AND YOU KNOW THIS IS A- AN INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT ISSUE AND INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT TIME AND- THAT'S WHY IT'S HERE BEING DONE NOW- AND I THINK THE THING THAT I WOULD. DESCRIBE IT- DID MENTION EARLIER IS THAT THIS IS GONNA BE A MULTI YEAR IMPLEMENTATION- BEGINNING NEXT YEAR OUR WORK IS JUST BE GONE ON IT THESE CONVERSATIONS ARE NOT OVER WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE DISCUSSING. THIS PROPOSAL- WITH ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS INCLUDING OUR COUNTY PARTNERS AND SO- WE AND WE REALIZE THAT TODAY THERE- IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL- BUT- OVERALL THEY HAVE BEEN A PART OF IT- WE DEFINITELY TRY TO INCORPORATE. MANY COMPONENTS- THAT THEY NEEDED CONSIDERATION- AND- AND YOU KNOW WE FEEL LIKE IT'S A GOOD BALANCE BETWEEN ALL SIDES- AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO KEEPING THAT CONVERSATION GOING- TO MAKE IMPROVEMENTS WHERE WE CAME. THANK YOU ALSO TO SKINNER THIRTY NIELSEN MMHM SENATOR SKINNER FIRST. I WAS GONNA GIVE HER THE FINAL WORD IN THAT SHE THE SUB CHAIRS LET'S GO TO HOUSTON TO NIELSEN LET ME GO ON AND ALL I'LL BE BRIEF I JUST WANT TO ECHO THE OBSERVATIONS OF MY TWO COLLEAGUES OF THIS. SPOKE AND I DO KNOW A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THIS AGENCY. AND THE RESPONSIBILITIES. AND I TAKE NO COMFORT IN THE KIND OF. TRUST US WORDS OF DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. IF ANYBODY WHO'S BEEN INVOLVED IN COUNTY GOVERNMENT AND I HAVE NOT BUT I THINK I'M RATHER EXPERT IN  REPRESENTING NINETEEN DIFFERENT COUNTIES OVER THE YEARS. THE WORST THING THAT COUNTIES CAN NEVER HEAR FROM THE STATUS TRUST US OR FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TRUST US. THE ONLY TIME IN MY EXPERIENCE THAT THE COUNTIES HAVE EVER HAD THEIR WORD OF THE WORD OF THE STATE CAP TO THEM WAS TRIAL COURT. FUNDING THAT WAS A LONG BATH. BUT WHAT WILL HAPPEN HERE THERE'S A MULTI YEAR WHATEVER OKAY. BUT I WOULD REMIND FINANCES THE PURPOSE OF THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM IS REHABILITATION. WHICH REQUIRES A LOT OF PROGRAMMING. AND ONE AREA WHICH HAS BEEN NEGLECTED HISTORICAL ONE THAT WAS UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF THE STATE. WHAT WHAT I CALL FOR THE BROKEN HEART. WHICH IS WHY OUR YOUTH SO MANY GET INTO DRUGS. ALCOHOL AND. CRIMINAL BEHAVIOR AND ACTIVITY GANKS. THE NOURISHMENT OF THE CHILD. LOVE AND DISCIPLINE AND AFFECTION OF THE FAMILY. WELL IN THAT THIS PURPOSE. OF THE JUVENILE JUSTICESYSTEM NOW REMANDED BY THIS IDEA. TO OUR COUNTIES IS GOING TO BE ALL ABOUT REHABILITATION. AND GUESS WHO'S GOING TO GET SUED. NOT THE STATE. COUNTY BY COUNTY JUST AS HAPPENED IN THE ORIGINAL CRIMINAL JUSTICE REALIGNMENT. THE INMATE LAWSUITS THAT SO BEDEVIL THE STATE. AND PUT THE STATE INTO RECEIVERSHIP IMPOSTERS BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. THOSE LAWSUITS MARCH RIGHT OUT INTO OUR COUNTY JAILS. AND NOW THEY'RE GONNA OF MARCH RIGHT OUT IN DEALING WITH THE JUVENILE OFFENDERS NOW REMANDED TO THE AUTHORITY OF THE COUNTIES. AND AS TO THAT REHABILITATIVE PURPOSE. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE KIND OF JUST GLOSSES OVER THAT WELL WE'LL DO SOMETHING HERE WOULD YOU SHOP IN THERE I'M SORRY YOU'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE THAT CHOICE. THE LAWSUIT WE'LL TELL YOU WHAT YOUR CHOICES ARE AND WHAT PROGRAMS WILL HAVE TO BE. ADMINISTERED I WOULD GIVE HIM SOME STARTUP MONEY FOR A FACILITIES. GREAT WHO'S GOING TO GIVE MONEY TO STAFF THOSE FACILITIES. TO CONCEIVE OF AND THE ARCHITECTS OF THOSE REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMS. AT THE BEST THIS IDEA IS NOT EVEN HALF COOKED AND I URGE. A NO VOTE. THANK YOU AND SENATOR SKINNER. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- I WANT TO FIRST THANK THE ADMINISTRATION FOR THE VERY PRODUCTIVE CONVERSATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN HAPPENING OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS. AND I FEEL THAT THIS IS COME A LONG WAY TOWARDS. I WANT TO PUT THIS INTO CONTEXT THAT. LAST YEAR READ THE LEGISLATURE ACTED ON THE GOVERNOR'S INISH INITIATIVE. WHICH THE GOVERNOR IN LAST YEAR'S WERE TO A YEAR AGO- BUDGET. PROPOSED TO MOVE THE ENTIRE- HANDLING OF JUVENILES WITHIN OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM INTO THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AND WAS VERY CLEAR THAT THE PURPOSE WAS THAT WE HAVE TO ACCEPT. AS WE OF- AS SCIENCE AND MEDICS MEDICINE AND EVERYTHING ELSE IS TELLING US THAT. JUVENILES WHO ARE IN OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. ARE NOT FULLY FORMED ADULTS ENACT FOR MANY OF THEM IT WAS A TRAUMA INCIDENT IT COULD BE A LEARNING DISABILITY IT COULD BE SO MANY THINGS THAT CAUSED DIFFERENT THINGS AND NOT AN ESSENTIAL CRIMINAL NATURE THAT CAUSED THEM TO. IN GAUGING WHATEVER BEHAVIORS LED THEM TO THAT SYSTEM. AND SO THERE WAS THIS EMBRACING OF THE GOVERNOR TO HELP ALL OF US LOOK ACT APPROACHING JUVENILES DIFFERENTLY THAN WE DO ADULTS NO WE ALL KNOW THE WE'VE ALWAYS APPROACHED EVEN KNOWS MUCH TO A DEGREE DIFFERENTLY. BUT HE REALLY ASKED US TO LOOK AT IT THROUGH THE LENS OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES. AND WE ADOPTED THAT. NOW A YEAR LATER OF COURSE WERE IN A PANDEMIC WERE IN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN AND IN OUR ADOPTION OF THAT WE AND THE GOVERNOR WE'RE SEMI SILENT ABOUT WHAT WE WOULD DO WITH THE STATE FACILITIES WHERE WE NOW HAVE EIGHT HUNDRED KIDS THE DEPARTMENT OF JUVENILE JUSTICE STATE FACILITIES- I THINK FIRST MANY PEOPLE THEN MAYBE THE GOVERNOR I DON'T SPEAK FOR HIM BUT I THINK IT WAS ANTICIPATED THAT OVER TIME. THOSE WOULD PROBABLY. CLOSE THAT THROUGH THIS HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES MODEL THERE WOULD BE DEVELOPED VERY DIFFERENT APPROACHES. BUT I THINK WE'RE THE PLACE NOW WHERE. I'M A VERY MUCH THROUGH BUDGET REASONS AND ALSO BECAUSE COMMUNITIES AFFECTED ARE HAVE ADVOCATED FOR A LONG TIME THAT. THEY FEEL THAT THE YOUTH SHOULD BE CLOSER TO HOME THAT THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE BETTER TREATMENT BETTER- DID DIEM FIREMAN IS BETTER- IF THEY'RE NOT SENT OFF TO THE CENTRALIZED FACILITIES SO THE GOVERNOR CAME BACK TO US THIS YEAR AND SAID. LET'S GO WITH THE LOCAL APPROACH. AND BUT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT WAS INITIALLY PRESENTED TO US COMPARED TO LAST YEAR'S IT DIDN'T HALF THAT HEALTH CONCERT HUMAN SERVICES COMPONENT AND SO THE CONVERSATIONS OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF MONTHS HAVE BEEN HOW CAN WE ACHIEVE. THAT. THAT DESIRE TO. TREAT OUR KIDS WITHIN OUR LOCAL AREAS HAVE OUR COUNTIES WHICH IN MANY CASES NO I STARTED OUT- JUST LESS THAN TEN YEARS AGO. THERE WERE MORE THAN FOUR TIMES. THE NUMBER OF KIDS IN OUR STATE FACILITIES THAN TODAY SO WE KNOW OVER TIME MANY OF OUR COUNTIES HAVE JUST ON THEIR OWN ACTED TO TAKE MORE RESPONSIBILITY LOCALLY AND TO HANDLE THERE ARE KIDS IN DIFFERENT WAYS AND WE ALSO KNOW THAT MANY OF OUR OWN COUNTY JUVENILE HALLS HAVE MANY FEWER KIDS SO ARE COUNTIES THEMSELVES HAVE REALLY TAKEN AN INITIATIVE MANY OF THEM. TO APPROACH JUVENILE JUSTICE A DIFFERENT WAY. SO WE NOW HAVE FAR FEWER KIDS AND- THE N. MANY COUNTIES WERE SAYING YES WE CAN HANDLE THIS BUT OF COURSE THEY WANT TO SUPPORT AND SO WHAT I THINK THAT THIS. MODEL AND- I BUT IT IT IT'S DISAPPOINTING TO HAVE THE COUNTIES SO UNIFORMLY AGAINST AD I THINK REALLY IF. IF THEY LOOK AT IT A LITTLE CLOSER I DON'T THINK THAT THEY WOULD FIND IT SO OBJECTIONABLE NUMBER ONE. HALF OF A RURAL COUNTIES HAVE NO KIDS IN OUR STATE FACILITIES HALF. SO HALF OF A RULER COUNTIES RIGHT NOW. HAVE SAID NO CHILD NO EIGHT OF THE EIGHT HUNDRED. AND UNDER THE FOREIGN FUNDING FORMULA IF WE WENT WITH A FUNDING FORMULA THAT SAID. YOU WOULD ONLY BE FUNDED IF YOU SENT A KID TO DJJ HALF OF OUR RURAL COUNTIES WOULD GET NO MONEY. AND SO THIS FUNDING FORMULA ENSURES THAT ALL OF OUR COUNTIES GET MONEY BECAUSE IT ACCEPTS THAT ARE COUNTIES UNDER THIS SCENARIO. WILL BE. HANDLING OUR KIDS AND THERE'S. WHILE THE TRAILER BILL SHOWS THE INTAKE OF DJJ STOPPING ON JULY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY ONE THE FACILITY STILL CLOSE THAT DAY IT WILL NOT BE A WHOLESALE. AND I BROUGHT UP THE EIGHT HUNDRED YOUTH THAT ARE CURRENTLY BECAUSE I WANTED TO. TO SORT OF HELP US UNDERSTAND THE SCALE THIS IS VERY DIFFERENT THAN OUR ADULT REALIGNMENT ARE ADULT REALIGNMENT WAS SUCH A MUCH MORE A HUGE SCALE COMPARATIVELY. WHAT OTHER POINTS DID I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE. SORRY I BROKE MY GLASSES TODAY AND THEY KEEP FALLING OFF MY FACE WHICH MAKES IT VERY HARD FOR ME TO REACH BUT- OF. SO ONE MOMENT. D. STATE IS IN THIS PROPOSAL PUTTING TWO HUNDRED MILLION ON THE TABLE AND IF WE WERE TO LOOK AT THIS IS ONLY BEING THOSE EIGHT HUNDRED BUT WE HOPE OF COURSE WE ARE HOPING THAT IT OR NOT HOPING THAT MORE KIDS GET INTO THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM BUT RATHER THAT WE ARE. PROVIDING A LEVEL THAT THE COUNTIES ARE ABLE TO MEET THEIR NEEDS THAT WHEN YOU THINK OF IT AS IT IS GOING TO ENSURE THAT EVERY COUNTY GET SOME LEVEL OF FUNDING I THINK IT'S VERY RESPONSIVE AND IT ALSO IF YOU WERE JUST A DIVIDED BY EIGHT HUNDRED IT'S QUITE A HEALTHY AMOUNT. NONE OF OUR BOARD OF STATE AND COMMUNITY CORRECTIONS WHICH NOW HAS A ROLE IN THE JUVENILES THAT ARE JUST HANDED. HANDLED ON THE COUNTY LEVEL NONE OF THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES ARE BEING IMMEDIATELY TRANSFERRED. AND BECAUSE WE ARE DOING THIS IN PHASES WE HAVE TIME TO MAKE ADJUSTMENTS AND ADDITIONALLY THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE REFERENCES THAT IT'S ANTICIPATED THAT THERE WOULD POTENTIALLY BE. REGIONAL FACILITIES WERE COUNTIES COULD COME TOGETHER AND POOL RESOURCES FOR PERHAPS THOSE YOUTH THAT NEED A DIFFERENT LEVEL OF SUPERVISION OR HOUSING FOR EXAMPLE SO WHILE THIS DOES NOT CROSS EVERY T. AND DOT EVERY I. I THINK DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE DID A GOOD JOB OF EXPLAINING THAT IT IS SOMETHING THAT WE ARE DOING AND FACES. AND IT DOES GIVE US THE ABILITY TO. ADJUST AND IT'S EVEN BUILT IN TO GIVE US THE ABILITY TO ADJUST AS WE MOVE FORWARD AND I JUST AGAIN REALLY I WANT TO EXPRESS MY APPRECIATION. TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND ADMINISTRATION FOR THE ENGAGEMENT AND I ALSO WANTED TO JUST EXPRESS THEIR IF WE THINK BACK TO OUR INFORMATIONAL HEARING ON THIS. MANY OF THE EXPERTS THAT WE HEARD FROM. REALLY TALKED ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF PRESERVING THAT LANDS OF THE HEALTH MODEL FOR OUR JUVENILES AND I THINK THAT WE HAVE DONE A GOOD JOB. IN IN. IN IN SHARING THE DATA IS THERE IN THIS MODEL. THANK YOU CENTER SKINNER ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS.

THE EITC OF THE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT WAS EXPANDED. TO I. TEN TAXPAYERS. IF THE TAX HAD A CHILD A QUALIFYING CHILD WHO'S FIVE YEARS OLD OR YOUNGER.

I THANK YOU ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS REMOTE MEMBERS. SEEN NONE WE WILL MOVE ON TO AB EIGHTEEN EIGHTY FIVE THE DEBTOR EXEMPTIONS HOMESTEAD EXEMPTION. FINANCE. EVEN AGAIN MA'AM CHAIR MEMBERS CRITICAL DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AB EIGHTEEN EIGHTY FIVE DEBTOR- EXEMPTIONS HOMESTEAD EXEMPTION SO CURRENT LAW STATES THAT A HOMESTEAD EXEMPTION PROTECTS THE VALUE OF A HOMEOWNER'S PRIMARY RESIDENCE IN THE EVENT OF A BANKRUPTCY SPECIFICALLY PROVIDES THAT A SPECIFIED PORTION IN EQUITY IN THE HOME STATE IS EXEMPT FROM COUNTY TOWARDS A JUDGMENT IN DEBT- THIS BILL INCREASES THE HOMESTEAD IN THE EXEMPTION IN PERSONAL BANKRUPTCY CASES TO THE GREATER OF THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND OR THE COUNTY MEDIAN. HOME SALES PRICE IS UP TO SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS AND THIS BILL ALSO PROVIDES THESE LIMITS SHALL BE ADJUSTED ANNUALLY FOR INFLATION WITH THAT VALUABLE TO ANSWERING QUESTIONS. THANK YOU QUESTIONS. MISTER COOK I SEE YOUR HAND UP THAT WAS JUST BECAUSE YOU WERE GOING TO BE THE ONE TO SPEAK ON IT. OKAY THANK YOU. YES ANY OTHER QUESTIONS ANY OF OUR REMOTE MEMBERS. THANK YOU FIFTEEN NINE WE WILL MOVE ON TO. AB THIRTY THREE THIRTY THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS BOARDS LICENSEES AND REGULATORY FEES. THANK YOU SENATOR MITCHELL KIMBERLY HARBISON AGAIN FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AB THIRTY THREE THIRTY INCREASES LICENSING AND REGULATORY FEES FOR THE BOARD OF BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES CALIFORNIA ACUPUNCTURE BOARD AND THE- MEDICAL BOARD AT THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS. EFFECTIVE JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY ONE. PROPOSED FEE INCREASES ARE NEEDED TO MAINTAIN EACH FUND'S SOLVENCY AND MAKE SURE LICENSING AND ENFORCEMENT MANDATES CAN BE CONTINUED WITHOUT DIMINISHING CONSUMER PROTECTION. OR REDUCING SERVICES TO LICENSEES INCLUDING CREATIVE CREATING SIGNIFICANT LICENSING BACKLOG. TWO OF THE BOARD DID NOT RAISE THEIR FEES AND MORE THAN TWENTY YEARS AND ONE HAS A TEMPORARY INCREASE IN PLACE THAT EXPIRES IN JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY ONE. THE BOARD TO LOOK FOR AND IMPLEMENTED OPPORTUNITIES TO CUT COSTS WHENEVER POSSIBLE BUT THESE FEE INCREASES ARE STILL NEEDED LARGELY AS A RESULT. OF COST INCREASES FOR THINGS LIKE EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION RETIREMENT. RENT ATTORNEY GENERAL RATES AND OTHER FACTORS OUTSIDE THE CONTROL OF THE BOARD. APPROVING THESE INCREASES WOULD ALSO NEGATE THE NEED FOR THE BOARD TO TAKE LOANS FROM OTHER DC SPECIAL FUNDS UNDER THE DEPARTMENT SPECIAL FUND LOAN AUTHORITY. KNOWN AS CONTROL SECTION FOURTEEN. ACHIEVING FUND SOLVENCY THAT WAY WOULD NECESSITATE AN EVEN LARGER FEE-INCREASE IN THE FUTURE BOTH COVER ONGOING EXPENSES AND TO PAY BACK THE LOANS. THESE PROGRAMS ARE ALL AT OR NEAR THEIR CURRENT STATUTORY FEE LIMITS AND REQUIRE LEGISLATIVE CHANGE TO AMEND THEIR EXISTING FEES. THE PROPOSED FEES INVOLVED IN SUCH THE TO SUPPORT THE FUNCTIONS OF THE BOARD OR PROGRAM AND ARE SUPPORTED BY CONTRACTED FEES STUDIES THAT WE'VE SHARED WITH THE LEGISLATURE. THE OTHER MAIN COMPONENT OF THIS BILL IS AN INCREASE IN THE ANNUAL FEE CHARGED TO LICENSEES. WHO ARE AUTHORIZED TO UTILIZE THE STATE'S PRESCRIPTION DRUG MONITORING PROGRAM NOTICED YOURS. OR THE CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE UTILIZATION REVIEW AND EVALUATION SYSTEM. BUT HERE'S FEES PAID BY DCA LICENSEES ARE USED TO REIMBURSE. THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE FOR WORKLOAD IDENTIFIED BY DOJ AND APPROVED THROUGH THE-BUDGET PROCESS TO OPERATE AND MAINTAIN THE SYSTEM. THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE STATES IN INCREASING IN THE HERE'S FEE IS NEEDED TO ADDRESS REVENUE SHORTFALL. AND IMPLEMENTATION OF LEGISLATION TOTALING MORE THAN FOUR MILLION WHICH IS PASSED IN RECENT YEARS. ACCORDINGLY THIS BILL PROPOSES TO CHANGE THE FEE FROM SIX DOLLARS TO ELEVEN DOLLARS ON APRIL FIRST TWENTY TWENTY ONE. AND THEN TO LOWER THE FEE FROM ELEVEN DOLLARS TO NINE DOLLARS ON APRIL FIRST TWENTY TWENTY THREE. AFTER DOJ COMPLETES THE INITIAL IMPLEMENTATION OF WORKLOAD RELATED TO CURE TO RESEARCHERS LEGISLATION AND THE ONGOING COSTS DECLINE. I'D LIKE TO NOTE THAT THIS THE LEVEL WOULD NOT COVER ANY ADDITIONAL COSTS THAT THE LEGISLATURE MAY WISH TO APPROVE FOR DOJ IN THE OUT YEARS. WHILE DCA CANNOT RAISE THE CEILING BUT ON ITS OWN. THIS BILL ALLOWS THE DEPARTMENT TO LOWER THE STATE'S REGULATION IF THE REASONABLE COST TO OPERATE AND MAINTAIN CURES ARE LOWER THAN THE STATUTORY LIMIT. I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO NOTE THAT DRUG OVERDOSE DEATHS HAVE SURPASSED MOTOR VEHICLE ACCIDENTS IN THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS AND YEARS ASSIST IN FIGHTING THIS EPIDEMIC WHICH WE ALSO HEARD MORE ABOUT. EARLIER TONIGHT. THAT CONCLUDES MY TESTIMONY I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE AND I ALSO HAVE TAYLOR SHAKE FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIR HERE WITH ME AS WELL. THANK YOU MS HARBISON MEMBERS QUESTIONS. UNDERPANTS THANK YOU- MADAM CHAIR- FISHY THE PRESENTATION FROM FINANCE AND CERTAINLY- SOMEONE WHO ALSO SERVES ON THE SENATE COMMITTEE ON. BUSINESS PROFESSIONS AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT HAVE SOME FAMILIAR DAVE BOARDS BUT ALSO SHOULD DISCLOSE MY CONFLICT OF INTEREST IS THAT I COME FROM A TO. BOARD HOUSEHOLD I AM A LICENSEE OF THE BOARD OF MEDICINE MY WIFE IS A LICENSEE THE DENTAL BOARD. ALLIES THAT NEITHER ONE OF THESE BOARD TO BE AFFECTED BY THESE FEES INCREASES SO THERE'S NO PERSONAL CANGE FOR US BUT- AS pLICENSE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA OF COURSE HAVE A- VERY PERSONAL INTERESTS AS WELL AS THE POLICY INTEREST IN HOW WE OPERATE OUR BOARDS AND FINANCE THEM. SO S. SEVERAL QUESTIONS THE FIRST OF ALL. I KNOW THAT THROUGH THE- COMMITTEE WE DO DO EVERY SEVERAL YEARS- WE REVIEW EACH BOARD AND- WE ACTUALLY DO ASKED THE BOARD THEMSELVES ABOUT THEIR FINANCES. AND THEY TELL US LIKE WHAT IS GOING ON IN TERMS OF THE FINANCES YET ADEQUATE FINANCING AND SO FORTH I RECOGNIZE THAT SEVERAL THE BOARDS HERE THAT YOU'VE POINTED OUT- YOU SAY NEED- INCREASE FEES. AND A YELLOW. I GUESS ONE QUESTION IS THAT- I MEAN WE'RE BUT WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT IN SUBSTANTIAL INCREASES- SO NICE YEAR TO ACUPUNCTURE LICENSING BOARD- IS WE'RE GOING FROM SEVENTY FIVE DOLLARS TO TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THAT'S LIKE A SO MANY OF THESE- BUT THEY'RE THEY'RE NOT LIKE 10% 20% OR EVEN 50% SOME OF THESE ARE LIKE A 100% 2100% 3100% INCREASES IN THE FEES- THE- ACUPUNCTURE TRAINEE FROM 52210024100% INCREASE ACUPUNCTURE TRAINING APPLICATION FEE TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS TO A THOUSAND DOLLARS. TWENTY FIVE TO A THOUSAND DOLLARS TO A THOUSAND DOLLARS- YOU KNOW- AND THEN WE TALK ABOUT THE BOARD BEHAVIORAL-SCIENCES AND WE OFTEN TALK HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE ABOUT THE SHORTAGE WE HAVE. MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS. AND YOU KNOW WE'RE DOUBLING THE FEES FOR A LICENSED MARRIAGE FAMILY AND- EDUCATIONAL COLLEGES MORE DOUBLE HUNDRED TO FIFTY VOCAL SOCIAL WORKERS YOU KNOW DOUBLING. SEVENTY FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY YOU KNOW AFRICAN LAZY A HUNDRED TWO HUNDRED FIFTY I MEAN WE'RE TALKING DOUBLING TRIPLING THEIR FEES. REGISTRATION FEES AND THEN ON TOP OF THAT IF IT WASN'T BAD ENOUGH THAT WE ARE DOUBLING TRIPLING QUADRUPLING.THEIR FEES THEN WE SAY THE BOARD THEMSELVES CAN INCREASES HE IS AGAIN AND OFTENTIMES DOUBLING THEM AGAIN. AND SO THAT IS QUITE DISTURBING TO ME I WILL POINT OUT THAT I KNOW THAT THE- IT WAS A PREVIOUSLY A BILL THAT WAS REJECTED BY THE SENATE- THAT ACTUALLY ALLOWED THE BOARD TO RAISE FEES WITHOUT LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT. SO I GUESS THERE SIR TWO PARTS THAT- EXPRESSED CONCERN ONE IS THAT. YOU KNOW WE HAVE THE FEE INCREASE ITSELF AND I CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND SO PERHAPS A MORE INDEPTH DESTINATION THAT'S WHY WE NEED TO DOUBLE TRIPLE. THESE FEES AND THE FOLLOW UP IS THAT IF THAT IS INSUFFICIENT WHY IS THAT NOT SUFFICIENT ITSELF AND WHILE WE ALSO AUTHORIZING THE BOARD ITSELF WITHOUT LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT TO DOUBLE THOSE FEES AGAIN. WHY NOT COME BACK TO LEGISLATURE AND SAY OKAY WELL. YOU DOUBLE THE FEES ON UB'S BECAUSE BASED ON THE WHATEVER INFORMATION YOU'RE-ABOUT TO TELL ME. WHY ARE WE ALLOWING THE BOARD THEN WE DOUBLE THE FEES WITHOUT COMING BACK TO LEGISLATION EXPLAINING WHY WHAT IS IT THAT'S GOING ON. IN THAT REGARD SO I IT ALSO SOME QUESTION ABOUT YOUR THE LET'S START WITH THIS. FINANCE THANK YOU DR PAN. I THINK OF IT IT'S UNFORTUNATE THAT IT'S COMING SIDING WITH THE ECONOMIC RECESSION THAT'S TAKING PLACE RIGHT NOW BUT FOR SOME OF THESE LIKE ACUPUNCTURE BOARD HASN'T RAISE THE FEES IN THIRTY FIVE YEARS SO. WHEN IT'S OVER A PERIOD OF TIME THAT IS THAT LONG ISLAND LATELY AND I APPRECIATE YOU SAID THAT ALREADY. SO IT HAS A VERY SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE BECAUSE OF THE TIME OKAY. LET ME POSE. AND YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TRYING TO RECALL THE LAST TIME THEY WERE BEFORE OUR COMMITTEE BECAUSE IT SAID. THE SENATE AND ASSEMBLY BOTH HAVE COMMITTEES THAT OVERSEE THESE BOARDS- THAT THE- IT'S COMMITTEE ON BUSINESS PROFESSIONS AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT HERE IN THE SENATE SIMILAR NAME AND ASSEMBLY. ANDREWS YOU THESE COMMITTEES ON A REGULAR ASIS AND I KNOW BECAUSE I'M A MEMBER OF THE COMMITTEE WE ASKED ABOUT THEIR FINANCES AND DO THEY HAVE ADEQUATE RESOURCES. AND SO USUALLY WHAT HAPPENS IS THEY TELL US THEY DON'T WE TELL THEM WELL SHOULD YOU INCREASE YOUR FEES. SO I AM CURIOUS AS TO SO YOU I KNOW YOU SAID THAT HE HAS AN INCREASE IN TWENTY YEARS. I'M CURIOUS WHAT HAS HAPPENED SUDDENLY. THAT AT LEAST SINCE THE LAST TIME THEY HAD A SUNSET REVIEW THAT'S HAPPENED THAT'S NOW SAID THAT THEIR THAT THEIR FINANCIAL SITUATION SUDDENLY DECLINED SO IT'S NOT TWENTY YEAR DECLINE. IT'S A MUCH SHORTER PERIOD OF TIME SINCE LAST SUNSET REVIEW I WHICH I CAN'T RECALL TO TOP MY HEAD EXACTLY WHEN LASSEN TO REVIEW IS FOR THESE BOARDS BUT- YOU KNOW WE DO THEM. FAIRLY REGULARLY SO IT'S BY LIKE FOUR OR FIVE YEARS AT THE OUTSET THE LONGEST AND PROBABLY SHORTER THAN THAT. SO WHAT'S HAPPENED RECENTLY. IT'S NOT SOMETHING HAPPENED TWENTY YEARS AGO. NO I'LL I'LL ASK TWENTY SAID CALLING FOR ASSISTANCE IN A MOMENT BUT I THINK- PART OF IT TOO IS OF THE BOARDS HAVE. TRYING TO BE RESPONSIBLE WITH THEIR FUNDS OVER TIME AND YOU KNOW TO SAVE MONEY WHERE THEY COULD END UP SORT BECAUSE THEY WEREN'T PAID FOR AND MORE DUTIES- MORE LICENSING REVIEWS MAR APPLICATIONS AND THINGS LIKE THAT AND THEY'RE AT THE POINT NOW WHERE THEY CAN'T. THEY DON'T HAVE ANYMORE. GIVE LEFT SO THAT'S WHY THEY'RE COMING NOW BECAUSE THEY'VE TRIED TO MAKE DO OVER THIS PERIOD OF TIME. AND IN SOME OF THE REVIEWS SAID THAT WE CAN MANAGE IT MORE YOU KNOW WORKING WITH AND WHAT WE HAVE. AND THEY'RE AT THE POINT WHERE THEY CAN'T DO THAT ANYMORE. OKAY SO. IS THE FEE INCREASE THAT YOU'RE ASKING THAT WE APPROVE. JUSTIN OURSELVES SO WE'RE DOUBLING TRIPLING QUADRUPLING SOME OF THESE FEES. IS THAT SUFFICIENT WHY IS THE BOARD NOW AUTHOR ALSO BEING AUTHORIZED TO DOUBLE THOSE FEES AGAIN WITH A DOUBLE DOUBLE THAT'S AFTER THE MAX OUT OF WHAT WE'RE ALLOWING THEM. AND THEN YOU'RE SAYING LET'S DOUBLE IT AGAIN WITH BOARD APPROVAL ONLY NOW LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT TO HOW MUCH MONEY DO WE REALLY NEED TO INCREASE THE FEES. THAT WE SHOULD BE OVERSEEING. AND NOT WITHOUT HAVING TO GIVE THE BOARD IT'S ALREADY TO INCREASE THE FEES WITHOUT LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT WHICH IS REALLY PROBLEMATIC BECAUSE THAT'S A POLICY WE REJECTED AS A SENATE EARLIER. WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT- DOCTOR PAN. DOUBLING AGAIN I THINK AREYOU REFERRING TO THE UP TO X. AMOUNT OF DOLLARS NINE YES SO WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT HERE YOU HAVE INCREASES THE LICENSING FEE LET'S SAY I'M JUST COME PICK ONE AT ACUPUNCTURE BOARD TWENTY FIVE TO FIFTY. AND THEN THE BOARD CAN INCREASE THE FEE UP TO THREE FIFTY THAT'S ACUPUNCTURE EIGHT. LICENSED FAMILY THERAPIST SEVENTY FIVE TO ONE FIFTY. AUTHORS THE BOARD INCREASE THE FEES UP TO THREE HUNDRED SO YOU WILL GO FROM SEVENTY FIVE TO ONE FIFTY SO YOU'RE DOUBLING IT. NAY SAYING THE BOARD ITSELF CAN DOUBLE IT AGAIN NOW THE THREE HUNDRED- LICENSES THE EDUCATIONAL THAT COLLEGE APPLICANTS. INCREASE FROM ONE HUNDRED TO TWO FIFTY AUTHORIZES THE- BOARD INCREASE THE FEE UP TO FIVE HUNDRED SO AGAIN WE'RE GOING FROM ONE HUNDRED TO TWO FIFTY. AND THE BOARD CAN NOW GO FROM TWO FIFTY TO FIVE HUNDRED DOUBLING AGAIN. OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN SO WHAT'S GOING ON. WHY IS THE BOARD BEING GIVEN THIS AUTHORITY TO RE DOUBLE THE FEE AFTER WE'RE READY DOUBLED OR TRIPLED IT. IN THIS- AS AS WELL. SO HOW MUCH MONEY DO YOU NEED. SO WE- THEM THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTION NOT DEPEND SO WHAT WE NEED IS THE AMOUNT THEY WERE ASKING FOR NOW. WHERE IN THE BILL IN VARIOUS PLACES IT SAYS WE NEED YOU KNOW. THIS FOR YOURSELF IN THIS AMOUNT NOW. THAT'S WHAT THEY NEED NOW WITH THE UP TO LANGUAGE IS A CEILING THEY WERE ASKING YOU TO APPROVE OR NOT SAYING. IT'S GOING TO BE WELL I THINK IF WE WANT CAN YOU. I THINK IF THEY WANT THE- MONEY. BACK TO LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT AND THE OTHER POINT I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE IS. THAT IT'S NOT WITHOUT INPUT JUST BECAUSE IT'S SET AT A LEVEL NOW. DEPARTMENT CONSUMER STILL HAS TO GO THROUGH REGULATORY- REGULATION PROCESS. AND THEY TALKED ABOUT THESE FEES WITH THEIR STAKEHOLDERS SANTA OKAY. IT'S A REGULATORY PROCESS A PRE SHEET THAT I WANT TO BE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS WE'VE REJECTED AS POLICY HERE IN THE SENATE. THE AUTHORITY YOU GET THE BOARD TO INCREASE THE SEAS. WITHOUT THE LEGISLATURE. WHICH IS WITH ETHICALLY WHAT YOU'RE ASKING US TO DO BECAUSE YOU'RE SAYING WE'RE GOING TO INCREASE THE FEES FROM WHATEVER TO YOU KNOW THIS EX NUMBER. AND THEN WE GAVE THE BOARD AUTHORITY TO AGAIN DOUBLE IT AGAIN. IN MANY CASES. AND I THINK THAT'S VERY PROBLEMATIC BECAUSE THAT'S NO DIFFERENT POLICY DECISION YOU'VE EMBEDDED IN HERE- SO WELL I'M NOT HAPPY ABOUT. INCREASING THE FEES I ALSO UNDERSTAND WE WANT TO BOARD THE FUNCTION. I THINK WE'RE BOTH ON THE SAME. SIDE ON THAT WE WANT TO BOARD TO FUNCTION. WE WANNA BE ABLE TO YOU KNOW WE ARE RECOGNIZED NEEDING THE FEES DECREASE FEES. BUT WHY IS IT WILL ME THE BOARD AUTHORITY TO INCREASE THE FEES EVEN FURTHER WITHOUT LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT TO KNOW IS WHY IS THE LEGISLATURE NOT. IT IS BASICALLY LEGISLATION BE APPROVING ANY FEE INCREASES. RIGHT AND OF COURSE YOU SHOULD HAVE A RECORD PROCESS WHERE YOU GET STAKEHOLDERS AND YOU COME BACK TO US HE SAID GUESS WHAT. WE NEED TO INCREASE THE FEES SO MORE BECAUSE OF THIS WE HEAR FROM OUR STAKEHOLDERS AND WE DID OUR ANALYSIS AND ECONOMIC YOU KNOW WE LOOKED AT THE BOARD EXPENDITURES BOTTLED BLOOD CETERA. AND YOU COME TO US AND YOU EXPLAIN TO US WHY AND THEN OF COURSE WE WILL SAY OKAY. OR WE MIGHT HAVE SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT IT BUT ACTUALLY WHAT YOU'VE DONE HERE AS YOU SAID WE'RE GOING TO. ASK YOU TO DOUBLE THE FEES BY THE WAY THROUGH BUDGET TRAILER BILL WHERE WE DON'T HAVE AS MUCH TIME FOR EXPLANATION AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO. ALLOW THE BOARD WITHOUT THE LEGISLATURE BECAUSE YOU GET AS YOU'RE TELLING US WILL PROVE IT IN ADVANCE. YES OF COURSE NOT INCREASING IT RIGHT AWAY BUT THEY'RE NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO DOUBLE IT AGAIN. THAT SEEMS TO ME TO BE VERY INAPPROPRIATE. MISMAS HARBISON IF YOU COULD RESPOND TO THE FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION WHICH IS YOU KNOW WHY CREATE THIS AUTOPILOT OPPORTUNITY TO INCREASE THE FEES AS OPPOSED TO. THE EXISTING LEGISLATIVE. INFRASTRUCTURE. I THINK THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL. IF YOU CAN THANK SENATE WEST. I THIS IS US ASKING FOR LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT TO SAY WE THINK. THIS IS WHERE IT NEEDS TO BE NOW AND WE CAN SEE IN THE FUTURE IT MAY NEED TO GO UP TO. AN ADDITIONAL LEVEL. THAT WE WOULD ASK THAT YOU. YOU KNOW IMPROVE. THAT MUCH LEEWAY FOR THE DEPARTMENT THROUGH REGULATION IN COMMUNICATION. WITH STAKEHOLDERS WITH THE PUBLIC- SAY THIS IS THE THRESHOLD THAT YOU. I GO TO AND THEN AFTER THAT YOU NEED TO COME BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE AGAIN- ESPECIALLY THIS YEAR I THINK YOU KNOW WE PROPOSE THESE EARLIER IN THE YEAR. IT WAS DEFERRED IN JUNE BECAUSE OF COMENZó JUST THE UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THINGS BY OUT AND TIMING. I THINK THIS IS AN EXTRA MEASURE TO BE SURE THAT WE CAN BE RESPONSIVE. TO THE NEEDS OF THE DEPARTMENTS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE PROVIDING CONSUMER PROTECTION THAT WERE NOT DELAYED AND HAVING. YOU KNOW. FUNDS THAT ARE IN ARE. OVER JOHN. WELL I THINK YOU NEED TO DO A MUCH BETTER JOB OF EXPLAINING. THE FEES AND FRANKLY- THEY SAID- YOU'RE TAKING YOUR MOVING TAKING SOMETHING ELSE BRAG OF THE LEGISLATURE. AND UNFORTUNATELY I DO NOT FIND YOUR ANSWERS SATISFACTORY IN THAT REGARD I THINK IF YOU SIMPLY PRESENTED US A SET UP FEE INCREASES AND PRESENTS THE EVIDENCE FOR WHY YOU NEEDED IT. THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN FINE FOR ME EVEN THOUGH I RECOGNIZE AS- THAT. BILLS FEES ARE AND HOW TO PEOPLE ARE PAYING THEM IT'S AN INCREASE ON THE SOMETHING THEY HAVE TO PAY. RIGHT BUT TO GIVE YOURSELF ALSO THE GRANT THE BOARDS THE AUTHORITY AFTER DATES AFTER. THE SENATE HAS REJECTED THAT IN THE PAST. IS A THREE TO INCREASE THE FEES WITHOUT LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT AND FORESEES A STEP TOO FAR AND I'M AND UNFORTUNATELY I'M ABLE TO SUPPORT. THIS PROPOSAL BECAUSE OF THAT HE STRIPPED OUT THAT PERHAPS WILL BE DIFFERENT. LET ME JUST TOUCH BRIEFLY ON CURES I APPRECIATE. THE CHAIR GIVING INTELLIGENCE. REGARDING THE- INCREASE CERTAINLY RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF THE CURES DATA SYSTEM- SOMEONE WHO AGAIN HAS TO USE THE SYSTEM. THIS EXPANSION OF THE CARE SYSTEM IS THIS TO ALLOW PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT LICENSED. THE LICENSEES WHO ARE ACTUALLY PAYING INTO THE SYSTEM IT TAKES EXPAND ACCESS TO THE TO ADDITIONAL PERSONNEL BEYOND PEOPLE WHO HOLD LICENSES. TO CARE SYSTEM. ARE YOU REFERRING TO THE DELEGATES DR GRANT I AM TALKING ABOUT THE CARE SYSTEM SOBRE INCREASING THE FEES OF THE CURE TO THE CARE SYSTEM TO SUPPORT EXPANSION THE CARE SYSTEM. IS TO EXPAND SO THAT THE CARE SYSTEM IS NOW ACCEPTABLE TO PEOPLE BEYOND THE PEOPLE WHO ARE LICENSED FOR PAYING THE FEES. SO THERE'S BEEN A NUMBER OF BILLS IN RECENT YEARS- FOR THAT WERE INCLUDED IN THAT DEPARTMENT JST AS THE C. P. IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN TWENTY AND THERE'S ONE THAT'S ACTUALLY INCLUDED IN THE BUDGET BILL JUNIOR THAT WE HEARD. EARLIER THIS EVENING- AB EIGHTY SIX AND- THAT COMPONENT FOR EIGHTY FIVE TWENTY EIGHT HAS ONE POINT. FOUR MILLION DOLLARS IN FEES SO. THE ANSWER IS YES OR NO I THINK IT'S A PRETTY SIMPLE QUESTION IS IT TO EXPAND THE CARE SYSTEM FOR USE OF PEOPLE BEYOND THE PEOPLE WHO ARE LICENSED WHO ARE PAYING THIS FEE. SO. IS DOING A NUMBER OF THINGS WHICH I WAS TRYING. METHODICALLY IF YOU'D GO AHEAD WITH YOUR EXPLANATION THAT'S FINE HE GO AHEAD. AND SO THERE ARE DELEGATES THE USER SYSTEM AND THEY ARE NOT BEING CHARGED FEES BECAUSE THEY ARE OFTEN UTILIZING THE SYSTEM ON BEHALF OF THE LICENSEE. SO FOR EXAMPLE IN A DOCTOR'S OFFICE YOU MIGHT HAVE. THE MEDICAL ASSISTANT OR TECHNICIAN. ACCESS CURES BUT THEY'RE NOT DOING IT INDEPENDENTLY THEY'RE DOING IT ON BEHALF OF A LICENSEE SO WE DON'T THINK IT MAKES SENSE TO TRY TO THE MEDITATIONAL FEE TO DO THE WORK OF. THAT DOCTOR'S OFFICE. OKAY WELL I THINK THAT- REGARDING THE CARE SYSTEM. I BELIEVE THAT IT SHOULDN'T IF WE DO EXPAND THE SYSTEM BEYOND THE POINT AND I UNDERSTAND YOUR POINT ABOUT IF SOMEONE'S ACTING AS AN AGENT ON BEHALF OF A LICENSE PERSON THAT'S DIFFERENT BUT IF WE'RE GONNA EXPAND THE SYSTEM ANYWAY BEYOND THE PEOPLE WHO ARE LICENSE. THEN THAT COST SHOULD BE BORNE MORE BROADLY THAN JUST SIMPLY THE LICENSEES BY INCREASING THE SEAS. SO I THINK WE JUST WANT TO KEEP KEEP THAT IN MIND AND ANY INCREASE AND THE CURES FEES IT'S EASY JUST IT CRANK UP THE FEES ON THE LICENSEES- BUT AS THE SYSTEM. IS BEING BROADENED IF WE'RE ENGAGING PEOPLE ARE ALLOWING PEOPLE THAN THOSE PEOPLE SHOULD ALSO SHARE IN THE COST OF THAT SYSTEM. SO APPRECIATE- THAT- EXPLANATION BUT THAT'S THE REASON FOR MY QUESTION IS ANSWERED ON QUESTIONS THAT WITH THAT THANK YOU SOME VERGE MADAM CHAIR. THANK YOU SENATOR DOLLY. I THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR JUST A QUICK COMMENT REAL QUICK I JUST WANTED TO. FOLLOW UP ON THE CONVERSATION WE'VE BEEN HAVING ON THE SET. LIST LEGISLATION. YOU KNOW AT THE TIME WE HAVE COPD AND WE HAVE YOU KNOW BUSINESSES THAT ARE. ARE STRUGGLING RIGHT NOW I JUST DON'T BELIEVE IS THE TIME THAT WE SHOULD BE.

AREA VERSUS RAISING FEES I JUST WANT TO MAKE THAT NOTE FOR THE COMMITTEE TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THANK YOU. MADAM CHAIR. THANK YOU ANY OTHER QUESTIONS.

GOOD EVENING MADAM CHAIR MY NAME IS BOB REID WITH READ GOVERNMENT RELATIONS- APPEARING ON BEHALF OF THE VALLEY ATWATER COALITION- FORTY THREE AGRICULTURAL WATER SUPPLIERS IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY WE WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION TO AB SIX. OPS SPECIFICALLY THE PROVISION IN THE LEGISLATION RELATING TO THE FISH AND GAME CODE. IT REALLY COMES DOWN TO THE PLACEMENT OF A COMMA IN THIS PROVISION OF LAW MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS- THE STAKEHOLDER COMMUNITY AND THE ATTORNEY GENERAL WERE UNDER THE BELIEVE SINCE THIS LAW WENT INTO EFFECT IN NINETEEN FIFTY SEVEN. THAT BOTH COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S AND THE ATTORNEY GENERAL HAD TO ACT ONLY ON THE COMPLAINT OF THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE IN ORDER TO PURSUE AN ACTION IN TRIAL COURT TO COLLECT CIVIL PENALTIES. AN APPELLATE DISTRICT DECISION IN THE THIRD APPELLATE DISTRICT. SAID THAT BECAUSE IN LAYPERSON'S TERMS BECAUSE OF THE PLACEMENT OF THE COMMON IN THIS SUBDIVISION I COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY DID NOT HAVE TO ONLY ACT UPON THE COMPLAINT FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE. INSTEAD OF COMING BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE GAINING THAT CLARIFICATION AND FIXING THE SUBDIVISION THE ATTORNEY GENERAL NOW WANTS TO MAKE IT EVEN WORSE BY ADDING IN. HIS ABILITY TO TAKE ACTION- IMPORT WITHOUT COMPLAINT OF THE DEPARTMENT FISH AND WILDLIFE. WHAT THIS COMES DOWN TO MADAM CHAIR IS THAT THE LEGISLATURE OVER TIME ESTABLISHES DEPARTMENTS TO PROVIDE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION OF THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA I'M TALKING ABOUT THE DEPARTMENT FISH AND WILDLIFE THE DEPARTMENT TOXIC SUBSTANCES CONTROL THE DEPARTMENT OF PESTICIDE REGULATION THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD ARE PROVIDED THIRTY BY THIS LEGISLATURE TO. REGULATE AND ENFORCE OUR VARIOUS ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS THEY DO SO WITH A SPECIFIC PURPOSE AND INTENT IS NO DIFFERENT IN THIS SECTION EITHER AND SO WE OBJECT TO THE PROVISION OF THIS BILL.

GOOD EVENING MADAM CHAIRMAN HONORABLE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE DEPUTY COUNTY COUNSEL WILLIAM LET'S OF THE COUNTY OF MONTEREY CALLING TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION TO AB. SIX CONTRARY TO WHAT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL STATED THERE ARE POTENTIAL COMPONENTS OF EIGHTY SIX THAT COULD AFFECT THE RIGHTS OF COUNTIES AND CITIES THAT HAVE ALREADY I HAVE ALREADY FILED SUIT. MONTEREY COUNTY FILED SUIT IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN. AND WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT. THE FACT IT IS A SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT IS ALREADY DISCUSSING TERMS SUCH AS ALLOCATIONS BETWEEN LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IN THE STATE IT IS NOT CLEAR THAT. THE STATE IS FULLY COGNIZANT OF THE COUNTIES AND CITIES PRIOR DAMAGES AND FUTURE COSTS TO THE BASEMENT. WE HAVE NO EVIDENCE THAT THEY'VE INVESTIGATED THIS. WE HAD NOT BEEN CONSULTED WE ARE A MEMBER OF A COALITION OF THIRTY THREE COUNTY. AND CITIES RECORD BY BARON AND BUDD IN WHICH WE ARE ALSO VERY ACTIVE CO COUNSEL- AND WE HAVE ATTEMPTED ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS TO CONFER WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE AND THEY HAVE REBUFFED OUR ATTEMPTS TO DO SO- ANY SUBSTANTIVE DEGREE THEY SAID THAT THEY WANTED TO MEET BUT WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO DISCUSS. ANY SPECIFICS OF THE SETTLEMENT WITH THEM. SO WE ARE QUITE CONCERNED- WE DID NOT HAVE A SEAT AT THE TABLE AND I WILL POINT OUT THAT THE FIFTEEN SEVENTY FIFTEEN METHODOLOGY- PROPOSED BY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL.
