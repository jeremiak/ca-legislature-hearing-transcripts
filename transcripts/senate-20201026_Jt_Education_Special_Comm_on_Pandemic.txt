TO FINALLY CLOSE THE DIGITAL DIVIDE. THE PURPOSE OF TODAY'S HEARING IS TO LEARN FROM SOME SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION AND WHAT THEY'RE DOING TO SERVE STUDENTS DURING THE COVERED OCCURRED AB. COBIT PANDEMIC SKEWS ME THIS HEARING IS NOT ABOUT WHETHER SCHOOL SHOULD FULLY RE OPEN OR ABOUT ISSUES OF SAFETY. TODAY'S HEARING IS MEANT TO EXPLORE ONE FACET OF K. TWELVE EDUCATION THE ASSEMBLY HELD A HEARING THAT FOCUSED ON THE DIGITAL DIVIDE AND ITS IMPACT ON STUDENTS. THE ASSEMBLY WILL HOLD ANOTHER HEARING TOMORROW TO DISCUSS THE SAFE RE OPENING OF SCHOOLS. DURING THIS PANDEMIC I'M PERSONALLY WORRIED ABOUT THE LOSS OF LEARNING AND THE LIGHTLY WIDENING OF THE OPPORTUNITY GAP. IT IS CRITICAL THAT EVERY STUDENT CALIFORNIA HAS ACCESS TO QUALITY pENVIRONMENT WHETHER THEY'RE LEARNING VIRTUALLY OR IN PERSON. I'M ALSO WORRIED ABOUT OUR STUDENTS WITH EXCEPTIONAL NEEDS THOSE NEEDING MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ENGLISH LEARNERS AND STUDENTS WHO NEED THEIR SCHOOLS TO PROVIDE A TRUSTED ADULT. IN A SAFE PLACE. IT IS CRITICAL THAT WE KEEP THE OPPORTUNITY GAP IN MIND AS WE CONSIDER WHAT IS BEST FOR STUDENTS AND SCHOOLS AND AS WE DESIGN OUR EDUCATIONAL AND SUPPORT PROGRAMS. SCHOOL EMPLOYEES AT ALL LEVELS HAVE BEEN WORKING INCREDIBLY HARD TO ADJUST TO BE INNOVATIVE AND TO CONTINUE TO SERVE THEIR STUDENTS WELL. AND I APPLAUD ALL OF YOU FOR THAT. FORTUNATELY THIS HEARING CANNOT COVER ALL ASPECTS OR REPRESENTATIVES FROM SEVERAL CRITICAL AREAS THAT DO DESERVE ATTENTION SUCH AS CHILD CARE FOSTER AND HOMELESS YOUTH. MEALS AND HEALTH SAFETY VULNERABLE OR NEGLECTED CHILDREN AND MIGRANT STUDENTS AND HIGHER EDUCATION. ONE OF THE CRITICAL AREAS THAT WE WON'T BE COVERING TODAY IS THE VAST SCOPE OF WHAT WORK. DONE BY CLASS OF FORTIFIED EMPLOYEES I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE A MOMENT TO RECOGNIZE THOSE EMPLOYEES. MANY OF WHOM PROVIDE INSTRUCTION AND SERVICES OFTEN TO OUR MOST VULNERABLE STUDENTS. CLASSIFIED EMPLOYEES ARE ESSENTIAL TO THE DELIVERY OF KEY SERVICES. FROM THE I. T. STAFF WHO ENSURE SCHOOLS CAN PROVIDE DISTANCE LEARNING. A TENNIS COURTS TO TRACK ABSENT STUDENTS TO SEVERAL CLASSIFICATIONS WORKING TO ENSURE STUDENTS HAVE ACCESS TO MEALS. ON THAT NOTE WE WILL BE HAVING A WE WILL BE JOINING THE SENATE HUMAN SERVICES COMMITTEE ON NOVEMBER SEVENTEENTH. TO DISCUSS FOOD IN SECURITY AND SPECIFICALLY ABOUT STUDENT ACCESS TO SCHOOL MEALS. THANK YOU ALL AND THANK YOU TO ALL THE WITNESSES I LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING FROM ALL OF YOU AND HEARING YOUR TESTIMONY. AT THIS TIME I'D LIKE TO ASK SENATOR GONZALEZ IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO MAKE ANY OPENING REMARKS.

TO WHAT IS A NEW WORLD OF DISTANCE LEARNING AND IN GENERAL A NEW WAY OF ADOPT ADAPTING TO THIS PANDEMIC INDUCED WORLD- WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE BEST PRACTICES AROUND THE STATE THAT WE CAN LEARN FROM. HOW DO YOU MAKE SURE THE EDUCATIONAL NEEDS OF ALL OF OUR STUDENTS ARE BEING MET ARE WE ADDRESSING THE INEQUITIES THAT EXISTED. FOR MOST VULNERABLE STUDENTS EVEN BEFORE THE PANDEMIC FOR ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES AND CHILDREN WHO ARE HOMELESS- I KNOW IN MY DOES TRICKS MENTAL HEALTH. TO BE A OF A BIG ISSUE IS. WITH THE COMPLIANCE SPANISH SPEAKING COMMUNITIES AND HOW DO WE ADDRESS THOSE NEEDS. OF THOSE ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS AND PARENTS. AND THERE'S ALSO ONE POINT TWO CALIFORNIANS WITHOUT ADEQUATE OR NO. INTERNET ACCESS WHATSOEVER SOMETHING THAT I AM CERTAINLY- GOING TO HONE IN ON. YOU KNOW THERE'S NO SUBSTITUTE FOR IN PERSON LEARNING AS SOON AS A SCIENCE SAYS IT IS SAFE FOR T. K. THROUGH TWELVE STUDENTS TEACHERS AND OTHER STAFF TO RETURN TO CLASSROOMS ACROSS THE STATE. WE WILL SEE MORE AND MORE. OF THAT HAPPENING UNTIL ALL OF OUR CHILDREN HAVE RETURNED TO THEIR CLASSROOMS. BUT IN IN THE MEANTIME WE NEED TO ADDRESS THE DIGITAL DIVIDE AND WHAT MORE WE CAN DO. MANY OF OUR A MANY OF US REPRESENT COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE ALL BEEN. NEGLECTED AND IGNORED BY COMPANIES. AND THE- MANY STAKEHOLDERS THAT NEED TO BE ABLE TO COME TO THE TABLE TO COOPERATE WITH US. WE CANNOT CALL OURSELVES THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY WITHOUT. TACKLING THE DIGITAL DIVIDE- IN A SERIOUS WAY.

FOUR FIVE SEVEN SEVEN FIVE FIVE NINE NOW LET'S HEAR FROM OUR FIRST PRESENTER MISTER DAVID ME CHERYL WHO IS THE SUPERINTENDENT OF CAJON VALLEY UNION SCHOOL DISTRICT WELCOME MR MAYOR SHE WROTE PLEASE TAKE IT AWAY. THANK YOU SIR MAY I PLEASE HAVE CONTROL THE SCREEN. THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT. THERE IS A OKAY YES WE CAN I'M GONNA START MYSELF ON A FIVE MINUTE TIMER TO BE RESPECT FOR MY COLLEAGUES. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE- IN TERMS OF THE DIGITAL DIVIDE THIS OUR CURRENT EIGHTH GRADE CLASS THEY'VE HAD THEIR OWN COMPUTER AND UBIQUITOUS WIFI FOR THEIR LEARNING SINCE THEY WERE IN KINDERGARTEN WE STARTED THIS JOURNEY IN TWENTY THIRTEEN. ASKING HOW CAN WE USE DATA SCIENCE MACHINE LEARNING AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TO MAKE IN THE CLASSROOM MORE HUMAN USING TECHNOLOGY NOT SIMPLY REPLACING THE TEXTBOOKS WITH A CHROMEBOOK HARDWARE GETS OLD REALLY FAST WE KNOW THAT IN CALIFORNIA. THE CONVERSATION HAS TO BE ABOUT SOFTWARE TOOLS. AND THE DIGITAL PROGRESS THAT'S HAPPENING GLOBALLY SO WE CAN USE THAT AND HARNESS THOSE. IN THE CLASSROOM. WHEN OUR KIDS SIGN ONTO THEIR COMPUTERS- THEY'RE AUTOMATICALLY LOGGED INTO ALL OF THEIR APPS AND PROGRAMS. THIS IS PART OF THE DATA SECURITY AND DATA PRIVACY. THAT HAS TAKEN AS A COUPLE YEARS TO BUILD. BEHIND THE FIREWALL. BUT REALLY TECH EMPOWER THE TEACHERS TO LEAVE THAT THE SAGE OF THE STAGE. AND ENTER A MORE PERSONALIZED LEARNING BLENDED ROTATION TYPE APPROACH. AND SO TWENTY FOURTEEN WE BEGAN USING SUMMER SCHOOL. AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO TRAIN OUR TEACHERS AND OUR STUDENTS ON HOW TO USE THE DEVICES SMARTLY. HOW TO MAXIMIZE INDIVIDUAL AND SMALL GROUP INSTRUCTION. SO THAT IF YOU LOOK WHAT KIDS ARE ON THEIR DEVICES ARE NOT ALL ON THE SAME PROGRAMS THERE'S ADAPTIVE TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE HELPING THEM. PERSONALIZE THEIR LEARNING SO WE CAN PROGRESS MONITOR AND MAKE SURE THAT EACH CHILD. WHETHER THEY'RE LEARNING LANGUAGE LEARNING CONTENT. OR ARE INVESTING IN THEIR MODERN CURRICULUM WE KNOW EXACTLY WHERE THEY ARE. AND SO ARE MONITORING GIVES ARE ARE BUILT INTO THE PROGRAM YOU'RE GONNA HEAR SHORTLY FROM OUR STUDENTS TEACHERS AND SOME OF OUR PARENTS. AND THIS. IS WHAT DISTANCE LEARNING LOOKS LIKE IN APRIL. SINCE TWO FOURTEEN WITH TWENTY ON A PLAN LEARNING MODEL WHERE WE'RE WORKING WITH THE STUDENTS IN PERSON WITH THEIR LEARNING BUT WE'RE ALSO WORKING WITH SOMEONE. AND THAT TRANSITIONS RIGHT NOW BEAUTIFULLY TOWARDS DISTANCE LEARNING. IT'S ALLOWING US TO KEEP THOSE PERSONAL CONNECTIONS AND ALLOWING US TO WORK WITH THE STUDENTS TO THEIR COMPUTERS. TO CONTINUE THE SUCCESS THAT WE'VE HAD WITH THEIR EDUCATION. WE GET TO DO OUR WEEKLY VIDEO CHATS THERE'S NO. KIDS GET TO SEE THEIR TEACHERS. THEY GET TO SEE THEIR FRIENDS. WE'RE ABLE TO START THAT ENABLE BECAUSE OUR KIDS AND TEACHERS ALREADY HAVE THEIR OWN TECHNOLOGY. AND PROGRAMS YES THE WAY WE OPERATE SCHOOL NOW RIGHT IT JUST DEPENDS ON YOUR DEFINITION AIRINGS ON THAT THE PROGRAM IS ACCESS. TWENTY ONE PILOTS BASIC SKILLS. SUBJECT MATTER AND HOME VALLEY MODERN CURRICULUM WHICH INCLUDES TO ADD. COMPUTER SCIENCE. SOCIAL. EMOTIONAL LEARNING AS WELL AS WORLD. SO WE BE ABLE TO. STUDENT PROGRESS AND- USING COMPUTERS. HONORING THE NEED FOR. PLAY AS WELL AS FAMILY TIME FOR ALL MEMBERS IN OUR LEARNING COMMUNITY. THAT WAS THE FIRST ITERATION IN APRIL ONE OF THE THINGS WE LEARNED RIGHT AWAY IS THAT A LOT OF OUR OUR KIDS WEREN'T ENGAGING AND THE DISTANCE LEARNING LARGELY BECAUSE BOTH PARENTS NEEDED TO WORK AND IN A LOW INCOME COMMUNITY PARENTS ARE GONNA GO TO WORK BUT- FOOD ON THE TABLE. AND SOME OF THE BEST NINE FOURTH GRADERS BEGAN BABYSITTERS FOR THE YOUNGER CHILDREN AND SO WE PUT TOGETHER A THREE CHILD CARE CENTER WORKER PROGRAM. SHAMAN LONG FORCE MY WIFE IS A NURSE. YEAH KIDS SECOND AND THIRD GRADE. WHEN WE HEARD THIS PROBE. IT WAS IT WAS REALLY A RELIEF FOR US BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN A LITTLE STRESSED IS NOT KNOWING HE SAID WHAT THE GONNA DO THIS WITH BOTH WORK. LESS FOR US WE ACTUALLY WAS WEAK THE FOR LEARNING. WE DIDN'T KNOW THAT I WHAT WE'RE BUT- GIBBOSA TO GO TO WORK AND DIDN'T HAVE A OPTION. WE OUR SCHOOLS IN PROVIDED THE LEARNING. ENRICHMENT IS A GLITCH. AND THE MEALS THAT THEY RELY ON AS WELL. WE CAN USE THE SUMMERTIME CARE ACT. SOCIAL DISTANCING AND SAFETY ROLES AND CINNAMON INCREASED. LEARNING PROGRAMS ALL TWENTY SEVEN OF OUR SCHOOL COMMUNITIES. WITH THE GOAL OF SOCIAL EMOTIONAL LEARNING AND CONNECTEDNESS IN MIND. SOME OF MY FAVORITE TAKE AWAYS. ARE SEEING OUR STUDENTS AND STAFF BEING EXCITED. TO BE WORKING WITH ONE ANOTHER. TO BE ABLE TO TAKE A LAUGH ON THE FIELD SAFELY TO BE ABLE TO COOK TO BE ABLE TO CREATE. IN OUR MAKERSPACE AND IT'S BEEN A FUN AND EXCITING WAY. FOR OUR STAFF AND STUDENTS TO PRACTICE WHAT OUR NEW SCHOOL YEAR MIGHT LOOK LIKE IN THAT GAVE OUR UNIONS TO TRUST. OPEN UP THIS IS A GREAT CLIP I DON'T HAVE TIME I THINK THE WAY LEARNING- THAT ALL OF OUR SCHOOLS ARE OPEN WE PRACTICE SUCH A DISTINCT ALL THE RULES IN PLACE AND CONTINUE THE OPTION OF DISTANCE RUNNING OR IN PERSON LEARNING. AS YOUR BROTHERS WILL BACK UP. WHEN THEY'RE ABLE TO. OUR SCHOOLS ARE PLACE FOR. GO FIRST. FOR FOOD AND THAT IN THAT ROUTINE AND TIME OF OUR LIVES WITH. THE SCHOOLS ARE JUST REALLY MAKE A C. PLACE FOR. PERSONAL FEEL THAT WHEN STUDENTS WALK IN THE DOOR THERE WATCH INTO A TO. AND BE THERE FAST SINGLE DAY. IT'S GOING BE. WEARING A MASK THIS IS BE TEARING SANITIZING AND LAW IN. BECAUSE AND ONE LAST ACTUALLY THAT WAS THERE LAST MUCH MORE TO BUT IT'S FIVE MINUTES INTO SECOND THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO OPPORTUNITY. THANK YOU MISTER SUPERINTENDED THAT WAS REAL HARD TO SEE AND THANK YOU FOR STAYING SO CLOSE ON TIME THAT IS MUCH APPRECIATED. NEXT WE'LL HEAR FROM SAN JUAN UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT BOTH FROM A SUPER BOWL FROM A DEPUTY SUPERINTENDENT AND A TEACHERS REPRESENTATIVE WE'LL BEGIN WITH MS BENSON ELLIE AND THEN GO TO MS BROWN. YOU MAY PERCEIVE AS WELL AS AN ALLEY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I'M JUST GONNA SET UP SO. YOU CAN SEE MONEY. EVERYBODY CAN SEE THAT WE CAN GREAT. AGAIN MY NAME IS MELISSA BASS MILLIE I AM THAT DEPUTY SUPERINTENDENT FOR SAN JUAN UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT AND I HAVE SHANNON BROWN WITH ME WHO IS THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR THE ST ONE TEACHERS ASSOCIATION. A LITTLE BIT ABOUT SAN JUAN UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT WE'RE LOCATED IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY AND INCLUDES BOTH URBAN AND SUBURBAN NEIGHBORHOODS ACROSS SEVENTY FIVE SQUARE MILES. OUR CURRENT ENROLLMENT IS JUST A BAD NIGHT. THIRTY NINE THOUSAND STUDENTS ACROSS OUR SIXTY FOUR SCHOOLS. AB ARMAMENT 47% ARE IDENTIFIED CURRENTLY AS LOW INCOME THIS IS A DECREASE FROM LAST YEAR WHERE IT WAS FIFTY FOUR PERCENT. 12% OUR IDENTIFIED AS STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES AND 15% ARE IDENTIFIED AS ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS. WITH 12% OF OUR TOTAL POPULATION HAVING AN IMMIGRANT STATUS MEANING THEY WERE NOT BORN IN THE US AND HAVE ATTENDED SCHOOLS U. S. SCHOOLS FOR FEWER THAN THREE YEARS. AND YOU CAN SEE OUR TOP THREE LANGUAGES IN OUR SYSTEM OR SPANISH DARI AND PASHTO. IN THE SPIRIT OF CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT THERE WERE SEVERAL LESSONS WE LEARNED IN THE SPRING THAT WE ARE ABLE TO BUILD UPON FOR IMPROVE DISTANCE LEARNING. PROGRAM IN THE FALL. AS WE PRESENT YOU TODAY WILL PRESENT WE WILL TOUCH UPON EACH OF THESE LESSONS LEARNED AND HIGHLIGHTED HOW OUR PARTNERSHIP HELPED US IMPROVE UPON OUR WORK IN THE SPRING. GIVEN TIME CONSTRAINTS WE PUT KEY TOPICS AND IDEAS ON OUR SITES RECOGNIZING THAT WE WILL NOT HAVE ENOUGH TIME TO GOING TO EACH AREA IN GREAT DETAIL. RIGHT SO ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS THAT WE REALIZED IS THAT WE HAVE TO SUPPORTER PRACTITIONERS IN THIS ADJUSTMENT. AND HONESTLY IN NORMAL TIMES IT'S DIFFICULT TO COVER ALL OF THE STANDARDS AND IN OUR VIRTUAL MODEL OR IN A HYBRID MODEL THAT CHALLENGE INCREASES. SO ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS WE SET OUT TO DO OVER THE SUMMER WAS TO TASK ADMINISTRATORS AND PRACTITIONERS. IN REVIEWING STANDARDS BY GRADE LEVEL AND CONTENT AREA AND LIFTING UP THE POWER STANDARDS TO IDENTIFY EITHER THE POWER CENTERS OR BUILDING BLOCKS STANDARDS. ONCE THEY IDENTIFY THOSE WE NAME THEM THE ESSENTIAL STANDARDS. IDENTIFYING THESE STANDARDS IT CREATED MORE SYSTEM ALIGNMENT AS WELL AS ALLOWING TIME FOR TEACHERS TO PRIORITIZE RELATIONSHIPS. AND COMMUNITY BUILDING SO THAT STUDENTS DO FEEL CONNECTED EVEN THOUGH WE'RE IN A VIRTUAL WORLD. YOU CAN ALSO SEE SOME AND TRAINING MODULES THAT WERE CREATED- I WOULD DO WANT TO FOCUS ON THE LESSEN BANKS. SO WE CO SELECTED PRACTITIONERS TO DESIGN LESSONS TO- SERVE EITHER FOR A FLIPPED CLASSROOM WHERE STUDENTS WATCH THE LESSON DURING ASYNCHRONOUS TIME AND THEN WHEN THEY'RE IN SYNCHRONOUS TIME WITH THEIR CLASSROOM TEACHER. THEY THE TEACHER CAN PROVIDE DIFFERENTIATION. THE LESSON BIKE LESSONS ALSO SERVED AS MODEL LESSONS FOR COLLEAGUES. AS YOU CAN SEE WE ALSO HAD TO IDENTIFY TIME TO PREPARE. ALLOW PEOPLE TO PREPARE TO ALLOW THEM TO COLLABORATE AND WE PRIORITIZE SOCIAL JUSTICE. IN OTHER LESSONS LEARNED WAS THE NEED TO STRENGTHEN SCHOOL HOME CONNECTIONS. AND SO WE CAN IN A LEARNING LESSONS FROM THE SPRING WE REALLY FOCUSED ON STRENGTHENING OUR COMMUNICATION EFFORTS REALLY KNOWING THAT CLEAR AND TIMELY COMMUNICATION. IS OFTEN A CHALLENGE BUT IT'S SO IMPORTANT DURING THIS TIME WHERE INFORMATION IS CHANGING AND WEEKLY AND AT TIMES DALY. ANOTHER PIECE OF STRENGTHENING SCHOOL TO HOME CONNECTIONS WAS REALLY VALUING FAMILY CHOICE AND WITHIN OUR SYSTEM AS A PART OF OUR PLANNING FOR A LEARNING MODEL CONTINUE M. DURING THE SPEED INTERNET. AND SO BETWEEN THE DISTRICT AND THE ASSOCIATION THERE'S A SHARED GOAL AND THAT WE HAVE EXPANDING PROVIDING CHOICE- ACROSS OUR LEARNING MODEL CONTINUE ON SO THAT WE CAN POSSIBLY MEDICAID AS IT DECLINE ENROLLMENT. AND SO THERE'S A COUPLE EACH KEY AREAS WHERE WE IDENTIFIED THAT WE WOULD WORK TOGETHER TO EXPAND. AND ONE WAS OUR K. EIGHT HOME SCHOOL PROGRAM THAT EXISTED PRE COALBED. IT GREW FROM SEVENTY THREE STUDENTS IN. NINETEEN TWENTY TWO EIGHT HUNDRED AND FIFTY EIGHT STUDENTS THIS CURRENT SCHOOL YEAR. IN ADDITION WE HAD ANOTHER INDEPENDENT STUDY PROGRAM FOR GRADES NINE THROUGH TWELVE. AND CREE COVE MADE IT WAS A HUNDRED AND SIXTY ONE STUDENTS ENROLLED IN THAT PROGRAM AND CURRENTLY WORKING HEARING ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED STUDENTS THAT PROGRAM. AND SO WE BELIEVE THAT BY WORKING TOGETHER TO EXPAND TO THESE OPTIONS AND IT EXPANDED IN THE TERMS OF THE SCOPE OF STOCKING AS AS TRAINING AND THE SUPPORT FOR THE PRACTITIONER. THAT BY EXPANDING THE OPTIONS AND HELPED US MITIGATE POTENTIAL DECLINING ENROLLMENT AS WE ONLY SAW A DROP IN OUR OVERALL MOMENT JUST UNDER TWO HUNDRED STUDENTS BELOW OUR PROJECTIONS. ANOTHER AREA THAT WAS A LESSON LEARNED FOR US WAS TO INCREASE OUR SAFETY NETS AND ARE TIERED RESPONSE AND THIS VIRTUAL WORLD. AND SO ONE PIECE THAT WE WORKED ON TOGETHER AND THAT WAS TO REESTABLISH OUR INITIAL PRE CODED INDICATORS THAT WOULD BE AN INITIAL INDICATORS TRIGGERING AND LAYERS OF SUPPORT FOR OUR STUDENTS. AND SO REALLY DIGGING BACK INTO THE ATTENDANCE TAKING PRACTICE AS A FIRST RESPONSE SYSTEM Q. AND IDENTIFY STUDENTS WHO ARE NOT ENGAGING OR PARTICIPATING IN DISTANCE LEARNING. AND THEN LAYERING AND CRATES AND OTHER ASSESSMENT PRACTICES THAT WE JOINTLY WORKED ON TOGETHER. IN ADDITION WE ALSO HAD TO REIMAGINE OUR SUPPORTS THAT WE ARE FORMALLY PROVIDED. I AM AN IN PERSON FORMAT TO SEE HOW WE MIGHT PROVIDE THOSE IN VIRTUAL SENSE. AND SO WE HAVE A LOT OF STAFF WHO WORK AND SUPPORT CENTERS THESE ARE STAFFS THAT ARE SOCIAL. OR SAYS FOR VARYING FROM TECHNO NEEDS AND HOW IS BEING TO FOOD. MOST SUPPORT SESSION THROUGH. HE WHICH IS EITHER ONE TO ONE AND SMALL GROUP OUR WHOLE GROUP SESSIONS WE ALSO HAD AN ACADEMIC SUPPORTS THAT ARE LAYERED IN ANOTHER KEEP PEACE THAT WE WANT TO HIGHLIGHT IS AND HER SOUL IS A PARTNERSHIP THAT WE ENTERED AND BUDGET IS A CONCIERGE SERVICE THAT CONNECTS COMMUNITIES TO RELIABLE HIGH QUALITY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. AND I AM IT IS OFFER TWENTY FOUR SEVEN EITHER BY PHONE OR WEBSITE DOES IT SUPPORT SERVICES OFFERED TO OUR STUDENTS FAMILIES AND STAFF AND WE LAUNCHED A AND MID AUGUST WITH NEARLY A THOUSAND ENQUIRIES AND FROM OUR STUDENTS AND STAFF WITH MOST OF THE ENQUIRIES BEING FOCUSED AROUND STUDENTS. AND ALSO LOOKING AT- SUPPORTS IN ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION. RIGHT SOURCE A LITTLE BIT INTERNET LINE HOW POSSIBLE BUT WE WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU THE ALL OF OUR SIDE LETTERS OF AGREEMENT DURING THIS TIME HAVE BEEN CREATED A SHARED GOOGLE DOC WE DID NOT EXCHANGE FORMAL PROPOSALS. WE IDENTIFIED THAT WE HAD SHARED INTERESTS FROM ME THAT. WE WANTED TO IMPROVE UPON WHAT WE DID IN THE SPRING. SO OUR PROCESS INCLUDED REFLECTING ON WHAT WORKS IN EDUCATION AND IN PERSON SCHOOLING. AS WELL AS REFLECTING ON- WHAT WE NEED TO APPROVE IMPROVE UPON IN THE SPRING. SO ONE OF THE MAIN THINGS THAT WE IDENTIFIED WAS THAT EACH SO WE NEED TO CREATE A SYSTEM. THAT ALLOWS EACH STUDENT TO GET WHAT THEY NEED RATHER THAN ALL STUDENTS RECEIVING THE SAME THING. SO WE THINK IT'S IMPORTANT. TO CALL OUT THAT OUR DISTANCE LEARNING SIDE LETTERS ARE CONSISTENTLY MISUNDERSTOOD. IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND UNDERSTAND THE STRUCTURE OF AGREEMENT YOU NEED TO CAN WHAT IN PER SCHOOLING. LIKE STUDENTS DON'T RECEIVE FIVE JUST HOURS OF DIRECT INSTRUCTION IN FACT I WOULD ARGUE THAT'S NOT GOOD PEDAGOGY. ARE THEY RECEIVING. AND THEN ENGAGING. PRACTICE AND THAT IS PACKED IT GOES BACK AND FORTH THROUGHOUT THE DAY. VERY CONTENT. SO WE COMPARE OUR IN OF SYNCHRON TIME TO DIRECT INSTRUCTION AN INDEPENDENT WORK TO ASYNCHRONOUS TIME IN OUR AGREEMENT OUR MINIMUM SYNCHRONOUS TIME IS VERY SPECIFICALLY- DEFINED TO MEAN A CLASSROOM TEACHER ALL STUDENTS AND INTERACTING ON ZOOM. OUR SECONDARY AGREEMENT IS STRUCTURED MUCH MORE LIKE A TRADITIONAL SECONDARY DAY WHERE THE KIDS ATTEND SCHOOL IN PERIODS. IN ELEMENTARY RESTRUCTURED THE SCHEDULE BY FIRST IDENTIFYING THE CLASSROOM TEACHER TIME AND THEN ALLOWING THE OTHER RACK ON SERVICES. THE PLANNED AROUND A TEACHER INSTRUCT. THIS THEY GO UP AND THE MEN INCLUDE KIND AREA. IN AREAS SUCH AS MUSIC ART HE SCIENCE SPANISH FOREIGN LANGUAGE THIS. WE ALSO HAVE OUR EMAIL DE TIME FOR TO SUPPORT ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS. THIS IS. IN ADDITION TO THE GREAT. MENASCO DESIGNATED GIVEN US FOR THE STUDENTS THAT ARE LEARNING ENGLISH ADDITIONALLY WITH SPECIAL EDUCATION SERVICES DOES HAPPEN- VARIETY OF WAYS DEPENDING ON THE- SO IN LAYERED ON SERVE LIKE SPEECH AND A- HE- THEY WOULD WORK WITH CLASSROOM. CHOI THE OF TIME TO DELIVER THAT SERVICE. RESOURCE THOSE THOSE TEACHERS WOULD WORK WITH THE KERR T. EITHER TO JOIN THE ZOOM OR TWO WHOLE DIFFERENTIATION SESSIONS OR ADDITIONAL SUPPORT SESSIONS AFTERWARDS. THE ACADEMIC INTERVENTION SUPPORT THAT WAS PROVIDED THAT COULD BE PROVIDED BY A CLASSROOM TEACHER IT CAN ALSO BE PROVIDED BY SOMEONE WHO IS AN ACADEMIC INTERVENTION SPECIALIST WITHIN OUR SYSTEM. SO HOW ARE TO START WITH HOW WE STARTED OUR ON THIS JOURNEY WAS WE HAVE A FOUNDATION OF TRUST. AND THE UNDERPINNINGS OF THAT IS THAT WE DON'T ARGUE ABOUT WHO CARES MORE ABOUT KIDS WE CARE ABOUT CATS. ALL OF THE PEOPLE WHO WORK IN OUR SYSTEM CAME INTO THE WORK BECAUSE WE WANT TO CREATE THE HIGHEST QUALITY EDUCATION SYSTEM THAT WE CAN'T. IN ADDITION OUR PARTNERSHIP ALLOWS US TO CALIBRATE WITH EACH OTHER AND BUILD THAT SHARED UNDERSTANDING THROUGH THE TRUSTING RELATIONSHIP WHICH ULTIMATELY IN TURN REDUCES CONFUSION FOR FAMILIES BECAUSE THERE'S CLARITY AND PROGRAM WHEN WE'RE ABLE TO START. DISTANCE LEARNING IN THE FALL. AND THEN ADDITIONALLY OUR PARTNERSHIP WHAT WE SITE IS B. WE SITE DEEP IN EXPANSION THROUGH THIS WORK TOGETHER WHETHER IT WAS BECAUSE WE HAD TO SEND THE SIZE TOGETHER B. ON TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF INFORMATION. AND FEEDBACK THAT WAS AND THAT'S CONTINUING TO COME OUR WAY- SO WHETHER IT'S- IT'S FANTASIZING AND SHARING UNDERSTANDING AROUND THAT OR WORKING TOGETHER TO IMPROVE SERVICES AND OUTCOMES FOR STUDENTS. WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO RESPOND TO THE CHALLENGES WITH CREATIVE CREATIVITY AND INNOVATION. AND CLARITY WHICH ULTIMATELY HAS TO HELP TO MINIMIZE CONFLICTS AND CONFUSION ON OUR SITE LEVEL. IN AND THIS IS THE KIND OF OUR- AND RIVER GRATEFUL FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY SHARE OUR WORK WITH YOU. LADIES YOU BOLT THAT WAS EXCELLENT I REALLY LIKE THE LIST LESSONS LEARNED AND MOST IMPORTANTLY IT WAS BUILT ON A FOUNDATION OF TRUST WE SHOULD ALL. GET TO THAT LEVEL THANK YOU VERY MUCH- NEXT WE'LL HEAR FROM A MERRY JANE BURKE WHO IS THE MARIN COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT OF SCHOOLS. MS BURKE PROCEED WHEN YOU ARE READY. I THANK YOU VERY MUCH I'M VERY- VERY HONORED TO BE WITH YOU AND WANT TO EXPRESS MY THANKS TO ALL OF YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE. AS I GIVE YOU INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING IN OUR COMMUNITY. IN MARIN AND I JUST WANTED BALLOTS THAT. MIGHT COLLEAGUES OTHER SEVEN COUNTIES. WHAT ALL HAPPENED VERY SIMILAR STORY TO YOU I DON'T WANT I'LL BE. THAT THEY ARE FOR. ON DOING. WE CAN TO MAKE SURE THAT WE GET OUR KIDS TO SCHOOL. AS SOON AS WE SAY. ODD TEND NOT WORK AND- BUT YOU CAN COLLABORATE HOW OTHERS IN A WAY THAT. ONCE NEED CAN BE. SO I'LL BE SPEAKING PRIMARY ABOUT SPECIAL ED. SO I ALSO TO START BY GOING BACK. FOR MOMENT AND NOT JUST TO WHAT YOU. FROM US OF MY- A WEEK TO SEE. PLANNING TAKE BACK TO AND- AS SOON AS WE- OUR OWN. OF WHAT WAS. IN TERMS. MOVING TO A JUST MY- AND IN MARCH WE ARE. AT CHILD CARE. FOR FIRST RATE. DOCTORS NURSE OTHER ESSENTIAL WORKERS. AND DURING THAT TIME. ALL BEGAN I DO. THE PROGRAM. IN STRUCTURES THAT WERE. NOT BE PASSED FOR TO OPEN OUR ESPECIALLY CLASSES PERSON. EVERY HAS BEEN BY BY FINES FIVE. HEALTH. ART SHOULD LOOK LIKE. HOW DO WE CHECK THAT A CHILDREN AND STAFF ARE HEALTHY WHEN THEY COME INTO CLASS ON HOW TO WE ESSENTIALLY DECLINED OUR CLASSROOMS SO THAT THEY'RE SAFE ONCE THE PP THAT'S- NECESSARY SO DURING THE PILOT- POP UP CHILD CARE WE WERE ABLE TO PUT TOGETHER. VARIETY OF PROTOCOLS BEGIN TO DOCUMENT THEM AND PROVIDE TRAININGS TWO THOUSAND THE COMMUNITY RELATED TELLS ALL. HE WE BECAME AWARE AS ABOUT ACROSS STATE. THAT FOR ME OF OUR WITH SPECIAL NEEDS- AS MENTIONED BY SOMEONE ELSE THOSE CHILDREN THAT NEED WORK TO GET THE SAME OPPORTUNITIES THAT DISTANCE LEARNING WHAT NOT WORKING THE PROGRAM THAT OUR OFFICE OPERATES PRIMARILY. IS FOR STUDENTS HAVE HAD VERY COMPLEX LEARNING NEEDS IT WOULD BE CONSIDERED IN THE MODERATE TO SEVERE RANGE MANY WITH UNDERLYING HEALTH CONDITIONS. AND SO IT DEFINITELY WASN'T WORKING HOW THE INFORMATION WAS COMING NOT JUST FROM PARENTS BUT FROM OUR TEACHERS AND SO KNOWING THAT ARE SPECIAL AND PROGRAMS ARE PRIMARILY SMALL COHORTS BETWEEN. EIGHT TO TWELVE STUDENTS WE DECIDED TO GO AHEAD AND DEVELOP A PILOT FOLLOWING THE PROTOCOLS THAT WE LEARNED AND IN CLOSE CONTACT WITH ALL THE STAFF WHETHER IT'S ADMINISTRATORS. LIVESTOCK OR THE TEACHER SO I STARTING IN MAY WE HAD HIGHLIGHTS THAT WERE BEING OFFERED IN DURING THAT TIME WE LEARNED MORE REFINED FOR THERE ARE PROTOCOLS. PROVIDED FOCUS GROUPS FOR STAFF FOR PARENTS AND THEN ULTIMATELY DECIDED TO OPERATE ALL OF OUR SPECIAL ED PROGRAMS IN PERSON ALL FOR THE SUMMER SO THIS LAST SUMMER. WE HAD STUDENTS COME INTO PLAY IN PERSON ALL WE DID A SURVEY WITH PARENTS 92% WERE. RAISING THEIR HANDS SAYING YES WE LOVE OUR STUDENTS BACK AND BACK IN SCHOOL- WE HAD TEACHERS WHO WERE. SAFE AND WE WERE ABLE TO OPERATE VERY VERY SUCCESSFULLY HOW WE WORKED WITH DOCTORS- WHO HAD. ESSENTIALLY PROP PROVIDED APPROVAL THAT MORE MEDICALLY FRAGILE STUDENTS WOULD BE ABLE TO. ATTEND SCHOOL IN A PHASED MANNER AND WERE ABLE TO STAND UP ALL OF OUR ALL OF OUR PROGRAMS I'M AT THIS POINT- WE HAVE FIFTY CLASSROOMS THAT ARE OPERATING ONE IS TOTALLY VIRTUAL AND THAT STUDENTS WHO ARE. PARENTS ARE EITHER NOT READY OR ARE IN A SITUATION WHERE THEY THINK THEIR MEDICAL SITUATION. DOES NOT YET LET THEM SCHOOL AND OTHER THAN. OF THE REST OF OUR PROGRAM ARE EIGHTY FIVE PER OR STUDENTS WHO ARE IN PERSON AND OTHERS WHO ARE CHANGING USING A BLENDED APPROACH WE HAVE A LIVE STREAMING STRUCTURE SO THAT STUDENTS ARE ABLE TO I CAN'T ATTEND IN PERSON THEY CAN STILL BE THERE FOR- ACTIVITIES. WITH THEIR CLASS AND- I'M- SORRY I DON'T TOO LONG WITHIN IT THAT WAS MY- BUT WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT. WHEN A PARENT HAS NOT. RISKY TO PARTICIPATE IN CLASS ON A DAILY THAT THEY RAISE THEIR AND SAY HEY WE'RE CHECK BACK SO. BOB LINE IS WE HAVE BEEN WORKING CLOSELY WITH ALL OF OUR STAKEHOLDERS AND DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN TO BRING BACK THE MOST VULNERABLE A STUDENTS IN OUR UNITY. NOW I NEED THESE OPPORTUNITIES IN ORDER TO ACCESS LEARNING I'LL STOP THERE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISS BURKE OUT THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR HIGHLIGHTING PUBLIC CHILD CARE THAT'S BEEN INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT AND ALSO THE GREAT WORK THAT YOU HAVE DONE AND SPECIAL ED BEING DONE IN PERSON. ALL RIGHT NEXT WE'RE GOING TO PROCEED TO OUR LAST WITNESSFOR THIS PANEL IT IS A NEEDED SHIRLEY FROM CORONA NO COURT NORTH. CORONA NORCO UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT SURELY PLEASE PROCEED WHEN YOU'RE READY. BUT AFTERNOON THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME THIS AFTERNOON. AND SIMILAR TO OUR PREVIOUS GUESTS I DO NOT HAVE A PRESENTATION BUT I HAVE WRITTEN UP. SOME INFORMATION THAT I WOULD LIKE TO SHARE WITH YOU AND WHEN ASKED TO SPEAK TODAY- THERE THREE SPECIFIC AREAS THAT. I WAS ASKED TO GIVE UP SO I AM THE COORDINATOR. OF OUR SCHOOL COUNSELING SERVICES. SO SIMILAR TO. THE DISTRICTS THAT WERE C. TODAY AT MANY OF OUR JUST. ACROSS UNITED. PROBABLY THE WORLD. OUR MENTAL HEALTH CONCERNS ARE EXTREME. BRANCH AND SO BUT I TO SPEAK TO TODAY IS WHAT ARE WE JUST SEEING HOW WE ADDRESS THE CONCERNS AND SO- THREE AREAS THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT. CABOT LOOK TOWARDS THE DRESSING OUR BUT OUR SCHOOL COUNSELORS AND ONE IS THAT WE HAVE A POSITION CALLED AND DINNER XIN COUNSELOR AND THIS INTERVENTION COUNSELOR IS. ONLY AT OUR HIGH SCHOOL LEVEL AT THIS TIME BUT WE DO HAVE SCHOOL COUNSELORS TO K. THROUGH TWELVE AND ARE VERY LARGE DISTRICT BUT AT THE INTERVENTION COUNSELOR. IS IT ONE OF OUR HIGH SCHOOL COUNSELORS WHO PREDOMINANTLY WORKS WITH SOCIAL EMOTIONAL- IN THE SOCIAL EMOTIONAL DEMAND FOR SCHOOL COUNSELING AND IN THE TIER TWO AND THREE WHICH IS THE MORE INTENSIVE- SERVICES THEY- WORK IN SMALL GROUPS INDIVIDUAL COUNSELING AND ALSO IN THE REFERRING OUT OF SERVICES. THEY WORK WITH IT STUDENTS WHO ARE IDENTIFIED AS HIGH RISK THEY PRESENT WITH SEVERE BEHAVIORAL OR EMOTIONAL CHALLENGES AND THESE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED THROUGH. SHORT TERM CRISIS COUNSELING GROUP COUNSELING AND OR A REFERRALS TO THE COMMUNITY- AND COMMUNITY AGENCIES BECAUSE SIMILAR TO- ALL OTHER DISTRICTS IN OUR STATE WE ARE NOT ON CAMPUS OUR COUNSELORS ARE PROVIDING THESE SERVICES TO RESUME. THROUGH PHONE CALLS THROUGH GOOGLE ME- THEY ARE DOING WHAT THEY CAN TO REACH OUR STUDENTS TO GET FROM THE SERVICES THAT THEY NEED. ANOTHER ASPECT- OF OUR SCHOOLS COUNSELING PROGRAM IS A FOSTER YOUTH COUNSELOR AND SO I KNOW EARLIER USE INTERNET WE WERE GOING TO TALK ABOUT FOSTER CANCELING YOUR FOSTER YOUTH BUT- I LIKE TO REALLY HIDE I HIGHLIGHT OUR FOSTER YOUTH PROGRAM- WE HAVE EIGHT COUNSELOR. ON A SIGN EVEN TWO IS DEVOTED TO WORKING WITH OUR FOSTER STUDENTS ALONG WITH WORKING WITH OUR FOSTER- COUNSELORS AT THE SCHOOL SITE SO ALL OF OUR COUNSELORS WORK WITH OUR FOSTER STUDENTS THEY PROVIDE- MONTHLY MEETINGS FOR OUR SCHOOLS. FOR OUR SCHOOL COUNCIL FOR STUDENTS AND MAKING SURE THAT THEY ARE CONNECTED WHAT SERVICES DO THEY NEED DO WE HAVE COMPUTERS THAT WE CAN OFFER THEM DO WE HAVE RESOURCES EVE SOMETHING. LIKE TOOTHPASTE BOOKS CLOTHING AND WE- GO ABOVE AND BEYOND FOR OUR FOSTER STUDENTS AND ACTUALLY WE- COLOR FOSTER STUDENTS THE ALL STARS AND WE- OFFER ALL STARRED PROGRAM AT ALL AND CHIEF TWELVE SCHOOLS IN OUR DISTRICT. AND IT ACTUALLY- JUST RECENTLY WAS ANNOUNCED THAT OUR ALL STAR PROGRAM IS A GOLDEN BALL WINNER SO WE'RE VERY PROUD OF THE WORK THAT WE'RE DOING WITH OUR FOSTER STUDENTS- ARE FOSTER CANCERS NAME IS JANICE SHE ALSO WORKS REALLY CLOSELY WITH OUR COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION TO MAKE SURE THAT. OUR DATA IS ACCURATE- ONE THING. TO NOTE ABOUT FOSTER YOUTH AND THE DATA IS THAT OFTEN TIMES THEY GET LOST IN THE SYSTEM AS WE MOVE FROM SITE TO SITE DISTRICT TO DISTRICT COUNTY TO COUNTY AND SO SHE WORKS REALLY CLOSELY TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR DATA IS UP TO DATE AND ACCURATE. AND THAT WE ARE KEEPING TRACK OF OUR STUDENTS. ONE OTHER. IS MAKING THAT OUR STAFF TREE AND SO WHAT WE RECOGNIZED IS THAT. OUR TEACHERS ALTHOUGH IN THE PAST HAVE ALWAYS BEEN FIRST AND FOREMOST IN FRONT OF THE STUDENTS IT IS EVEN MORE LIKELY THAT THEY ARE THE PEOPLE WHO ARE ENGAGING FULLY WITH THEIR STUDENTS BEFORE OUR SCHOOL COUNSELORS BEFORE ADMINISTRATORS AND SO OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS THROUGH THE ADOPTION OF THE ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY TWO FORTY SIX AND EIGHTY SIX SEVENTEEN SIXTY SEVEN WE DO AND HAVE HAD SUICIDE PREVENTION POLICIES AND BOARD POLICY IN PLACE FOR OUR SCHOOL DISTRICT AND WE HAVE ALONG WITH THAT ASSEMBLY BILL ADOPTED COUNTRY NEEDLE WHICH IS A SELF PACED COURSE THAT OUR STAFF TAKES. TO LEARN ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH AND SUICIDE PREVENTION SO ALL OF OUR TEACHERS AND ADMINISTRATION TAKE THIS COURSE AND WE HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMEND OUR CLASSIFIED STAFF TO TAKE THIS COURSE BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT OFTENTIMES ARE CLASSIFIED STAFF ARE FIRST AND FOREMOST WORKING WITH SOME OF OUR AND MOST AT RISK STUDENTS. WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING AND TO ENGAGE WITH OUR STUDENTS THROUGH THIS VIRTUAL TIME IS ALSO CONDUCTING NEEDS ASSESSMENTS WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE MEETING THEM WHERE THEY ARE AT WHAT. AND WHAT DO THEY NEED FROM US IS IT MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES IS IT A COMPUTER IS IT FOOD WHAT ARE THOSE NEEDS THAT WE CAN OFFER FROM THE SCHOOL DISTRICT. WE'RE OFFERING OUR SCHOOL COUNSELORS OFFERING GROUP AND INDIVIDUAL COUNSELING. WHERE OFFERING MORE- CLASSROOM LESSONS AND I THINK THEY'VE EVER- OFFERED IN THE PAST THEY'RE ALSO WORKING WITH STUDENTS THROUGH WHAT THEY'RE CALLING LUNCH BUNCHES AND SO OFTEN TIMES MAYBE THEY DON'T HAVE TIME TO OFFER A CLASSROOM LESSON. BUT THEY'RE OFFERING THEIR TIME DURING A LUNCH BUNCH. TO WORK WITH STUDENTS TO JUST LEARN AS A SKI. OR A COVER. OUR STUDENTS ARE SO- ENGAGED BUT DISENGAGED AT THE SAME TIME THEY DON'T HAVE THEIR COMPLETE CAMERAS ON THERE MAYBE NOT PARTICIPATING IN CLASSES THIS LUNCH BUNCH OFFERS THIS KIND OF ENGAGEMENT AND SOCIALIZATION. WHAT WE ARE DOING DIFFERENTLY SINCE- COLLUDED IN SINCE WE BEEN OUT- SIMILAR TO- ADD MARY JANE BEFORE WE I THINK THAT THE SAME THING OKAY IT'S GONNA BE ABOUT A MONTH- BUT WHAT CAN WE DO- BUT WHAT HAVE WE BEEN DOING SO. EVERYTHING IS BEING OFFERED VIRTUAL MY COUNSELORS HAVE LITERALLY TURN ON A DIME TO SERVE OUR STUDENTS AND THEY ARE WORKING AS A TEAM THEY ARE PLAYING TO PEOPLE STRINGS THEY ARE LOOKING TO INTERESTS. WE ARE PUSHING OUT NEWSLETTERS TO FAMILIES HOW CAN YOU BE INVOLVED WHAT SHOULD YOU BE LOOKIG FOR WHAT ARE SOME IMPORTANT THINGS TO BE- INFORMATION TO HAVE. AND THEY HAVE ALSO. AND I DID SEND SOME INFORMATION BEFORE AND I'M HOPEFUL THAT YOU WILL ALL BE ABLE TO REVIEW IT AND ART WE'VE HAD AYE WHATEVER CANCERS CREATE A VIRTUAL CALL IN A ROOM. THAT IS A REALLY COOL AND UNIQUE RESOURCE AND- WE'VE ACTUALLY BEEN RECOGNIZED ACROSS THE WORLD FOR IT WE GOT SOME INFORMATION HAT PEOPLE IN ASIA ARE USING IT- PEOPLE IN ENGLAND AND- DISTRICTS FROM ACROSS THE UNITED STATES ARE ASKING IF THEY CAN UTILIZE A VIRTUAL CALMING ROOM AND IT'S A PLACE FIRST. FAMILIES AND STUDENTS TO GO AND- COLOR PLAY A GAME I TAKE SOME DEEP. AND IT'S A REALLY FIND IT UNIQUE I'M KIND OF COOL INVENTIVE WAY TO ENGAGE WITH OUR STUDENTS. ALL MANY OF OUR SITES HAVE BEEN CREATED WITH- CAN UNIVERSAL CANCERS HAVE CREATED WEBSITE SO THAT THEY CAN ENGAGE WITH THEIR FAMILIES. WE'VE ALSO RECENTLY HAD A DISTRICT COLLEGE FAIR ON VIRTUALLY EVERYTHING IS DONE VIRTUALLY AND THEN MANY OF THEM ARE. ALSO NAVIGATING AND REACHING OUT TO FAMILIES THROUGH FACEBOOK AND INSTAGRAM. AND SO I JUST HOPE THAT YOU CAN SEE THAT HERE IN CORONA NORCO WE ARE ENGAGING- WITH OUR STUDENTS ON THEIR MENTAL HEALTH CONCERNS BUT- AT A GREATER LEVEL ALSO IN MANY OF THESE- TACTICS CAN BE EXPLORED AND- REALLY REPLICATED ACROSS- ACROSS THE STATE AND ACROSS. THE US SO THANK YOU ALL FOR HAVING ME HERE TODAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISS SURELY BUT I THINK THAT MENTAL HEALTH IS BEEN TOP OF MIND FOR MANY OF US ABOUT ALL OF OUR STUDENTS.

AND THEN ALSO- AS WE MOVE FORWARD HERE INTO THE SPRING SEMESTER AFTER DECEMBER. CAN YOU TALK TO US ABOUT. HOW YOU'RE COMMUNICATING WITH YOUR PARENTS AND YOUR STUDENTS. IF WE START SEEING VIRUS LEVELS GO UP- IN WHAT THE MESSAGES THERE NO THAT WERE TALK ABOUT ACCESS TO DISTANCE LEARNING BUT- IF WE HAVE TO START RIGHT AB MATCHING BACK WHAT DOES THAT LOOK LIKE AND HOW DO YOU.

ACT WITH PUBLIC HEALTH AND RECEIVED A- AND TRAIN NEW WEEKLY SO THAT'S ONE OF THE STRATEGIES THAT WERE USING AND I KNOW OTHERS HAVE. STRATEGIES THAT ARE PROBABLY HAS AFFECTED MORE MORE EFFECTIVE. NO THANK YOU ONE LAST QUESTION. MADAM CHAIR. CHARLIE NINE CERTAIN SAUCES- I'M- READING YOU SEEN SOME ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS GO BACK SCHOOL TALK WITH US IF YOU WILL- ABOUT THE COMMUNICATION TO PARENTS AND STUDENTS ABOUT IT THERE IS A NEED TO BE ABLE TO GO BACK TO. FULL DISTANCE LEARNING NOT PROVIDING THOSE OPTIONS RATHER GET THE HEIGHT RELIGION WELL CAN YOU TALK TO US ABOUT WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE. AS HONESTLY WE HAVE TO ALWAYS LOOK AT WHAT A WORST CASE SCENARIO MAY BE ESPECIALLY AS WE GO INTO WINTER ACCIDENT BURKE. SURE SO AT THIS POINT. IN MARIN COUNTY I WOULD SAY ALL OF OUR- HE CAME THROUGH- THREE SCHOOLS WILL HAVE IN PERSON OPPORTUNITIES FOR KIDS AS EARLY AS MADE NO. AND THEY ARE. MODELS THERE IS JUST. WHERE IT IS NOW OKAY ARE RIGHT IT IS PROVIDING PROPER. TEN THAT THE ABILITY AND WITH JUST LEARNING SO THAT'S NUMBER ONE. WELL WE HAVE STRONG PROTOCOLS PLACE RELATING TO SEND THEIR- THAT WE WOULD TO PUT INTO PLACE IN THE- OF. A COPEPOD THAT. FOR JUST THAT POINT WE'VE HAD A HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND. GAINES IN OUR COUNTY PERSON AND OF THOSE DAYS THERE HASN'T BEEN A SINGLE SCHOOL TRANSMISSION OF STUDENTS TO STUDENTS STUDENTS AND STAFF BACK TO FAT PERSPECTIVE STUDENTS OR SEEN. NO BERRIES. A PROTOCOLS BUT WE KNOW THAT IN THE EVENT THAT WE- CANNOT WITHOUT PRACTICE DOING THAT- WELL WE DIDN'T DO IT AS WELL AS I WOULD HAVE HOPED IN MARCH BUT WE WILL BE SO MUCH. STRONGER AND READY TO GO IN THE EVENT THAT THAT. HAPPENS YOUR- THANK YOU MCGUIRE OF DOC. MY SHE WROTE I THINK YOU HAVE YOU HAVE UP TO ALL RESPOND THAT QUESTION IS CORRECT IN QUESTIONS PART OF A SANTA COUNTY. ARE WAIVER PROCESS ALSO NOW WORLD OUR PLAN HAS T INCLUDE MULTIPLE SCENARIOS LIKE YOU. YOU ASKED ABOUT TERMS IT IN. IN FALLS CLOSURE. WE START MEETING WITH OUR PARA AND THE PRESIDENTS WE- AS SOON AS WE ARE DOWN AND- THAT WITH OUR LABOR GROUP SO. MANY IS FRANK OFTEN. BECAUSE THE RULES CHANGE THE POLICIES HAVE CHANGED SO FREQUENTLY AND OFTEN. THAT THEY NEED TO BE REGULAR. AND SO EVEN NOW WE HAVE. 70% OF OUR STUDENTS ARE IN PERSON. LEARNING WE'VE HAD TO QUARANTINE. PROBABLY HUNDRED STUDENTS TO DATE. BASED ON CONTACT TRACING AND PRECAUTION. AND SAID TO MARY JANE'S POINT WE HAVEN'T HAD ANY SCHOOL TO SCHOOL PRESS SPREAD. AND WE'VE BEEN OPEN SINCE APRIL. AND SO SAID SCHOOL SAFETY FOR US IS ABOUT ABOUT A PRACTICE JUST LIKE OUR FIRE DRILLS AND EARTHQUAKE DRILLS. AS LONG AS EVERYONE KNOWS THE ROUTINE PROCEDURES AND FOLLOWING THEM. AND WE CAN ELIMINATE MITIGATE RISK. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WE'RE GOING TO GO TO SENATOR ELENA GONZALEZ AND WE'RE GOING TO GO TO SENATOR HANNAH BETH JACKSON AND THEN SENATOR PAN CENTER GONZALEZ THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND THAT THIS QUESTION MAY BE FOR SUPERINTENDENT MEET EURO- AND A FEW OTHERS AS WELL I'M JUST INTERESTED IN. THE HYBRID MODEL THAT YOU'RE IN CURRENTLY AS IT PERTAINS TO DIGITAL ACCESS AND ATTENDED ENTIRELY CROSS REFERENCING THOSE TO ENSURE THAT IF THERE ARE KIDS THAT DO NOT- THAT ARE HAVING TROUBLE LOGGING ON TO THEIR WIFI OR LOGGING ON TO THEIR- THEIR- THE- THE DEVICE. BY THE ACTUALLY IF FULLY INTENDING. THE SCHOOL AND I DON'T KNOW HOW THAT DATA IS BEING CROSS REFERENCED- YET ACTUALLY THAT THAT THAT PLAYS INTO A POINT THAT I OPPOSE SOMETHING WE DISCUSS ANYWAYS IN TERMS OF ATTENDANCE AND ENGAGEMENT TRACKING RIGHT. THE WAY THAT WE'RE CURRENTLY DOING IT NOW IS STRESSING OUT TEACHERS AND FAMILIES AND IS MEASURING THE WRONG THINGS IN TERMS OF WORK COMPLETION. BUT ENGAGEMENT AND CONNECTIVITY AND STUDENT. BASICALLY CONNECTION TO THEIR CLASSMATES AND A TEACHER ARE IMPORTANT CRITICALLY IMPORTANT. AND SO. IN OUR FIRST ROUND OF DISTANCE LEARNING WHEN IT WAS THE ONLY OPTION. BASICALLY FROM MARCH THROUGH JUNE- WE LOST ABOUT FOUND MOSTLY WAS BECAUSE THEIR PARENTS DIDN'T HAVE THE STABLE STRUCTURE AT HOME. TO GET THEM ONLINE TO PROVIDE THAT SAFE SPACE FOR THEM. THEY BECAME THE BABYSITTERS THEY BECAME A SYSTEMS THAT WORK. AND SO A LOT OF THAT THAT REASONS ARE KIDS COULDN'T GET ON HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THE TECHNOLOGY OR THE CURRICULUM OR THE TEACHING. IT WAS JUST THE FAMILY DIDN'T HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE TO PROVIDE A SAFE SPACE FOR LEARNING. NOW THAT WE'VE OPENED OPTIONS WE HAVE OPTIONS FOR DISTANCE LEARNING FULLY FOR PARENTS THAT WANT THAT. WE HAVE OPTIONS FOR IN PERSON LEARNING AND THEN WE HAVE A HOME SCHOOL OPTION WHICH TAKES THE ONUS OF. THE TEACHING LEARNING OFF THAT SCREEN TIME BUT MORE THE INDEPENDENT STUDY WORK COMPLETION. AND THAT'S BEEN HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL BECAUSE NOW PARENTS THAT. THEY'RE CHOOSING TO KEEP THEIR KIDS AT HOME FOR DISTANCE LEARNING AND ARE PROVIDING A SPACE I THE KIDS ARE GETTING THEIR THEIR NEEDS MET. AND THERE'S STILL A HANDFUL OF KIDS THAT WERE STILL ONE ON ONE WITH TWO HOME VISITS AND FAMILY LIAISONS. TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO BEST ENGAGE THEM BUT WHEN FAMILIES HAVE A CHOICE AND THEY HAVE A STRUCTURED. THEN ENGAGEMENT CAN RISE AND WHAT WE SHOULD BE MEASURING IS NOT WORK COMPLETION AND SCREEN TIME. BUT RATHER HOPING ENGAGEMENT USING TOOLS LIKE GALLUP THE GALAXY ENGAGEMENT CALL CALIPARI JUDGEMENTAL. AND DIAGNOSTICS TO SHOW THEIR KIDS ARE MAKING PROGRESS NOT THAT THEY'RE TURNING IN A WORK PACKAGE THANK YOU IT DOESN'T SHOW ANYTHING WE NEED TO HAVE DIE. AND TOOLS WITH THESE COMPUTER ADAPTIVE. TECHNOLOGIES THAT SHOW PROMISE. IN LEARNING AND READING LANGUAGE ARTS AND MATH. THANK YOU FOR MUCH AND I HAVE A COUPLE MORE QUESTIONS HE SAID VERY MUCH SUPER. THAT WAS A GREAT ANSWER AND THEN. THE NEXT QUESTION IS FOR SUPERINTENDENT BASS AND ALI AND DIRECTOR BROWN I BELIEVE. CAN YOU JUST CLARIFY YOU'VE BEEN DOING SOME REALLY GREAT WORK IN THE POINTS THAT YOU PUT TOGETHER WERE VERY ORGANIZED AND REALLY GREAT TO HEAR ABOUT- AND HOW WE CAN EXPAND THOSE BEST PRACTICES STATEWIDE. CAN YOU CLARIFY HE WORK BEING DONE TO MAKE STUDENTS FEEL MORE CONNECTED WE OFTEN HEAR OF COURSE THEY'RE DISCONNECTED THEIR THEIR VIDEOS ARE OFF. THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT NUANCES I HEARD ABOUT THE LUNCH BUNCH THAT I BELIEVE- MS AS SURELY AS- DISCUSSED BUT HOW HOW HOW SUCCESSFUL HAVE THOSE SUPPLEMENTAL. OPPORTUNITIES BEEN. YES I'D LIKE TO RESPOND TO THAT. AND WE HAVE DEVELOPED MULTIPLE APPROACHES TO ENGAGING STUDENTS IN THE CLASSROOM AND SO. WE ARE GRABBING ATTENDANCE DATA AND- DALY AND LOOKING OUT PARTICIPATION NOT WAY AND WE ALSO HAVE TEACHERS REFERRING. REGARDING ENGAGEMENT CONCERNS WITH STUDENTS WHETHER THEY'RE NOT FULLY PARTICIPATING AND THE DIGITAL CLASSROOM OR THEY HAVEN'T SEEN THEN AND- WE HAVEN'T SEEN OR HEARD FROM THEM IN A WHILE AND SO WE HAVE TIME. REPURPOSED A LOT OF OUR STAFF ONE THING THAT- IS VERY EVIDENT IS THAT NONE OF US HAVE THE SAME ROLES THAT WE USED TO HAVE. PRE COATED. AND SO WE UTILIZED A VARIETY OF SUPPORT STAFF TO ON DISABILITY OUTREACH TO SEE IF IT'S AN ISSUE I HAVE- DEVICE CONNECTIVITY. OR FAMILY INFRASTRUCTURE OR IF IT'S RELATED TO SOMETHING LEARNING IN THE CLASSROOM AND SO AND- WE HAVE WE HAVE TEAMS THAT INCLUDE CLASSIFIED STAFF AS WELL AS CERTIFICATED STAFF AND WE'VE BEEN USING CULTURAL BROKERS TO HELP AS OUR REACH TO FAMILIES. WITH WHO AND MIGHT HAVE. LANGUAGE ACCESS ISSUES. GREAT THANK YOU AND THAT'S A MATTER FINANCING PLEASE IN THE YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT IN THE NEXT QUESTION ACTUALLY IS A GREAT SEGUE AS YOU MENTIONED LANGUAGE ACCESS ON THIS ONE THIS QUESTION IS FOR MR LEE. ON MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES I HAVE A LOT OF IT I KNOW THAT I'M PREACHING TO THE CHOIR HERE BUT I HAVE A LOT OF COMMUNITY MEMBERS THAT. ASK ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AND LANGUAGE ACCESS OPPORTUNITIES FAR BEYOND MAYBE WHAT IS EVEN AVAILABLE SO HOW DO WE- BEST PARTNER I THINK THERE WAS SALAS THAT WAS BROUGHT UP BUT- WHAT CAN WE DO TO SUPPORT THESE UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES THAT SPEAK. SPANISH COME BY VARIOUS LANGUAGE THAT- NEED THESE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES HOW ARE WE OUT REACHING TO THESE COMMUNITIES. THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION SO WE SIMILAR TO- I DON'T REMEMBER WHICH DISTRICT MENTIONED CAROUSEL IS THAT WE DO PARTNER WITH CAROUSEL IS ALSO AND CARE SOLIS I BELIEVE HAS. A HUNDRED AND FIFTY DIFFERENT LANGUAGES THAT THEY- HAVE TRANSLATIONS FOR THE STUDENTS AND SO. IF WE KNOW THE LANGUAGE AND WE- EXPLAIN THAT TO OUR- TO THE CARE SOLIS CONCIERGE THE NAME MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE APPROPRIATE PEOPLE ARE REACHING OUT TO THE FAMILIES- AND THEN WE- IN OUR DISTRICT WE HAVE A- WE HAVE EIGHTY SIX SCHOOL COUNSELORS WHICH IS. SOUNDS LIKE A LOT BUT WE HAVE FIFTY THREE THOUSAND STUDENTS SO IT'S REALLY NOT THAT MANY- AND WE AND WE HAVE MANY CONCERTS WHO SPEAK. DIFFERENT LANGUAGES AND SO ALTHOUGH THEY MIGHT BE A HIGH SCHOOL COUNSELOR OR AN ELEMENTARY COUNSELOR WHEN WE HAVE STUDENTS WHO NEED. MANDARIN OR VIETNAMESE OR THAI COLLEAGUE OR SPANISH WE HAVE COUNSELORS WHO CAN HELP WITH THOSE SERVICES ALSO. TO BE ABLE TO SPEAK TO THE FAMILY TO- EITHER PROVIDE SERVICES OR LINK THEM TO SERVICES IN THEIR IN THEIR NATIVE LANGUAGE IN THEIR HOME LANGUAGE SO- I AGREE THAT THE LANGUAGE IS A BARRIER BUT WE ARE DOING THE VERY. BEST THAT WE CAN TO HELP OUR FAMILIES. THANK YOU. VERY GOOD THANK YOU SO MUCH WE'RE GOING TO MOVE OUT OF SENATOR JACKSON CENTER JACKSON PLEASE PROCEED WHEN YOU'RE READY THANK YOU SO MUCH AND THANK YOU ALL FOR DOING THIS- I DON'T MEAN FOR YOU THIS IS CERTAINLY ONE OF THE MORE CHALLENGING PARTS OF THIS- COLEMAN. NINETEEN CERTAINLY THE NON MEDICAL SIDE OF IT IS SO HOW WE DOING WITH OUR OUR KITCHEN AND- HOW ARE TEACHERS AND HOW THE WHOLE PROCESS IS WORKING SO I JUST WANNA GIVE YOU ALL. THE SHOW TO THANK YOU FOR WHAT YOU'RE DOING- I HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS- ONE THE FIRST ONE RELEASE HOW DO WE KNOW HOW OUR KIDS ARE DOING- YOU KNOW USUALLY- SO MUCH OF. IDENTIFYING HOW THEY'RE SUCCEEDING IN THEIR DEVELOPMENT IN THE SUCCESS OF THEIR EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCE IN THEIR DEVELOPMENTIN GENERAL IS BECAUSE- IN TEACHERS HAVE THOSE IN. HIGH THAT THEY ARE ABLE TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS IN PERSON- GIVE A HUG OR WATCH CHILDREN INTERACTING WITH EACH OTHER WHAT'S THE NORM WHAT ISN'T WHAT'S OUT THERE THAT IS HELPING. I YOU AS OUR PROFESSIONALS IDENTIFY AND DETERMINE WHAT'S WORKING AND WHAT ISN'T WORKING WHEN IT COMES TO THESE- BOTH THE ACADEMICS OF IT AND THEN THE SOCIALIZATION AND MENTAL HEALTH ASPECTS OF THAT EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCE. I START SENATOR JACKSON PLEASE PROCEED AGAIN WHAT I LOVE TO BE THE SOLUTION FOR POST CODE IS WIND I DIAGNOSTICS AND PROGRESS MONITORING WAS COME TO COMPUTER ADAPTIVE TOOLS. THAT BLEED INTO NOT JUST LANGUAGE ARTS AND MATH BUT OTHER CONTENT AREAS TO BASED ON THE TYPES OF SOFTWARE. AND IN CONTRACTS THE DISTRICT HAS YOU CAN SEE REAL TIME DATA ON A DASHBOARD THAT WE CAN EASILY SUBMIT TO THE STATE FOR ACCOUNTABILITY TO SHOW EXACTLY WHAT'S HAPPENING ACADEMICALLY WITH THEIR KIDS. THE GALLUP STUDENT ENGAGEMENT PAUL THE GALLUP PARENT GAZED UPON GALLUP EMPLOYEE ENGAGEMENT POLL DO REPORT ON THOSE THINGS HOLD. AYE ENGAGEMENT SOCIAL MOTION A WELLBEING AND WELLNESS AND SO IF WE WANT THOSE THINGS THEN WE MEASURE THOSE THINGS BECAUSE WHAT GETS MEASURED GETS DONE. BUT THOSE TOOLS AND ADDITION TO REGULAR MEETINGS WITH OUR PARENTS OUR WHOLE STYLE AS WELL AS SMALL GROUPS AND CONVERSATIONS- ONE OF ONE ON ONE THE STUDENTS ONE OF ONE OF THE FAMILIES IS HOW WE GET THAT INFORMATION ABOUT HOW THEY'RE REALLY DOING. THE CONVERSATIONS THAT WE HAVE WITH OUR PARENTS AND FAMILIES ARE CRITICAL AND WE'VE INCREASED SALES BY. 1000% IN THE LAST EIGHT MONTHS. WELL THAT'S GREAT THE PRO AGAIN IS AS MUCH AS A AYE IS HELPFUL AT ALL THERE'S JUST NOTHING LIKE THAT DIRECT CONTACT AND YOU MENTIONED WORKING WITH FAMILIES BUT WE HAVE A LOT OF FAMILIES WHERE THEY'RE NOT ENGLISH SPEAKERS- WHERE THEY'RE WORKING. YOU KNOW TWELVE HOURS THEY ARE ACTUALLY MAY NOT EVEN KNOW HOW THEIR KIDS ARE DOING BECAUSE- THEY'RE NOT AT HOME- ARE THERE ARE ARE THERE ANY SYSTEMS ARE IDEAS IN. DISCUSSION OR IN PLACE RIGHT NOW TO ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES. PARTICULARLY SINCE WE'RE NOT WITH OR IF WE ARE BACK 27080% OF CLASSROOM TIME BUT- YOU KNOW JUST ALL THE READING IS THAT THIS WEEK THERE'S ANOTHER WAVE COMING IN. AND THERE'S A REAL UNCERTAINTY ABOUT WHAT THE NEXT FEW MONTHS ARE GOING TO LOOK LIKE- FOR. OUR KIDS IN SCHOOL AND WHAT HAVE YOU OTHER ANY OTHER- OPTIONS OR PROGRAMS OR IDEAS THAT ARE FOMENTING OR THAT THAT HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED. CENTER JACKSON- AMERICAN. MAYBE WHAT I CAN AS FAR AS- WHAT WE JUST HEARD. WHAT ARE TEACHERS ARE IS NOTHING. TEACHERS COUNSELORS. STAFF HELLO MIRACLE MAKING UP THE NUMBERS .COM THAT ARE BEING HAD THAT ARE INDEED GET WITHIN CHILDREN AND THEIR- NOT SCHOOL HOURS BUT BEFORE SCHOOL AFTER SCHOOL ON THE- AND SHE MIGHT GUESS THERE'S NOT MORE. THAN BACK ABS INTERACTION BETWEEN THE STUDENT AND THE TEACHER AS WELL AS A PARENT AND SO ONE OF THE I THINK MORE SIGNIFICANT THINGS THAT THAT IS HAPPENING. IN REAL TIME RIGHT NOW ARE THE NUMBER OF CONTRACTS THAT STUDENTS ARE GETTING INDIVIDUALLY AND BACK ON IN AND OF ITSELF CAN MAKE SUCH A DIFFERENCE I TO ENSURE THAT BEST YOU UNDER WE'D MISS. MORE THAN THEY NEXT ASTON WE CAN'T WAIT RIGHT TO BE ABLE TO HAVE A MORE TYPICAL INTERACTION BUT WHAT OUR EDUCATORS ARE DOING- IS ACTUALLY UNPRECEDENTED- IN MY YEARS IN THIS FIELD. BUT I WANT TO QUICKLY JUMP IN ON ON. THAT COMMENT I THINK THAT. WE SHOULD TRY PERFECT WHICH IS PROVIDE YES WE ARE IN UNDER TERRITORY BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS PEOPLE CAME INTO THIS PROFESSION BECAUSE THEY CARE ABOUT KIDS. THEY WANT TO HELP THEM LEARN AND GROW ACADEMICALLY THEY WANT TO SEE THEM THRIVE AND SURVIVE. SO I THINK THAT WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE LISTENING TO THE PEOPLE WHO ARE IN DIRECT SERVICE TO STUDENTS DURING THIS TIME. ABOUT AS MELISSA PERSONALLY MENTIONED EARLIER I THINK WE HAVE TO REACH DOUBLE DOWN ON pHAVE TEAMS FIGURING OUT HOW TO SUPPORT KIDS- BUT THERE IS NOTHING THAT IS GOING TO REPLACE. THE INTERACTIONS OF HUMAN BEINGS WE KNEW THAT WHEN WE WERE IN PERSON AND IT'S JUST NOW BEEN AMPLIFIED. SO I HEAR THAT WE WANT TO SOLUTION ABOUT HOW TO DO THIS. I WE ARE YOU KNOW WE'RE MAKING EVERYTHING UP AS WE GO ALONG BASED ON WHAT WE- KNOW WORKS WHEN WE'RE SERVING PEOPLE IN PERSON. AND IT IS ABOUT CONNECTING WITH HUMAN BEINGS IN WHATEVER FORMATS THAT WE CAN MAKE HAPPEN. TO MAKE SURE THAT KIDS KNOW THAT THEY ARE SEEN HEARD AND VALUED AND THAT WERE THERE AND CARE ABOUT THEM. I WOULD LIKE TO ADD SOMETHING ALSO REAL QUICK- WANTED PIECES THAT WE ARE WORKING ON ACTUALLY CURRENTLY IS. THIS IDEA AROUND THAT THE MENTAL HEALTH OF OUR STUDENTS IS NOT A SCHOOL PROBLEM IT'S A COMMUNITY PROBLEM AND SO HOW CAN WE- ENGAGE THEM IN OUR COMMUNITY TO HELP WITH- GETTING RESOURCES OUT TO FAMILIES IF THEY'RE NOT CHECKING OUR- FACEBOOK OR INSTAGRAM OR GET LISTENING TO. THOSE VOICEMAILS I GO HOME EVERY SINGLE NIGHT EVERY SINGLE WEEK HOW ELSE CANWE ENGAGE WITH OUR FAMILIES AND SO WE HAVE AN INTERFAITH- MEETINGS AND OUR COMMUNITY AND GETTING INTO THOSE MEETINGS HAVING THOSE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE INTERFAITH- SO THAT. NGUYEN MESSAGING GOES OUT IT'S ALSO BEING MESSAGE THROUGH OUR CHURCHES THROUGH OUR SYNAGOGUES THROUGH OUR MOSQUES. THAT IT'S NOT JUST A SCHOOL IT'S- SITUATION BUT IT'S REALLY A COMMUNITY IT'S REALLY. WHAT I LIKE TO SAY AND WERE ROUTE WE NEED TO WRAP AROUND OUR STUDENTS IT'S NOT ONLY A SCHOOL- SITUATION RIGHT NOW AND SO THAT IS ONE OF THE OTHER AREAS THAT WERE REALLY LOOKING AT IS THAT. HOW CAN WE LEVERAGE OTHER ASPECTS OF OUR COMMUNITY TO HELP US WITH. OUR FAMILIES AND OUR STUDENTS. SO AND THANK CONSTRUCT THINK YOU'RE YOU'RE HELPS RIGHT IT'S JUST ABOUT THIS CENTRO WATERS I DON'T THINK WE WERE NECESSARILY PREPARED. FOR THIS SO LET LET ME ASK THIS QUESTION- LESSONS LEARNED. BY GOING FORWARD. I HAS IS THERE ANY KIND OF- A COLLABORATIVE EFFORT STATEWIDE FOR EXAMPLE. IN ONE OF MY COUNTIES IN VENTURA COUNTY IT'S ARE THEY DISCOVERED. THAT SOME OF THESE KIDS- AT THE HOME SITUATION IS JUST NOT CONDUCIVE FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS TO DOING THIS KIND OF ZOOM IN. DISTANCE LEARNING SO THEY'RE. HELPING CREATE. IN IDEAS. THE BACKDROPS FOR STUDENTS SO IT APPEARS THAT THEY'RE IN A DIFFERENT WORLD THEN PERHAPS THEY ARE- IS A SAY FEEL COMFORTABLE AT ALL I MEAN THIS IS KIND OF AN INTERESTING IDEA I SUSPECT EVERY SCHOOL AND EVERY CHILD IN EVERY DISTRICT HAS SOME OF THESE. ISSUES AND DIFFERENT ISSUES AND INNOVATIONS THAT THEY'RE APPLYING IS THERE IS THERE ANY KIND OF COLLECTIVE DISCUSSION ABOUT THIS AND I ANY SHARING OF LESSONS LEARNED ANYTHING THAT THAT WE IS POLICYMAKERS CAN DO. TO HELP IN THIS REGARD BECAUSE I YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY WE'VE BEEN OUT SINCE MARCH IN MANY INSTANCES A LOT OF KIDS HAVEN'T BEEN DOING ANYTHING EDUCATIONALLY FOR MANY MONTHS SO THEY'RE WAY WAY WAY BEHIND WHAT'S BEING DONE ON THAT SCORE ARE YOU ALL TALKING TO EACH OTHER. WHAT WHAT ARE THE NEXT STEPS AND HOW DO WE AVOID THIS HAPPENING IN THE FUTURE. SENATE JACKSON ON BEHALF OF THAT FIFTY EIGHT COUNTY SUPERINTENDENTS DEFINITELY THIS IS A CONVERSATION WE HAVE EVERY WEEK OR EVERY OTHER WEEK WHO'S DOING WHAT WHAT'S WORKING WHAT HAVE YOU LEARNED WHAT SHOULD WE MODIFY. BUT THIS IS DEFINITELY A STATEWIDE STATEWIDE CONVERSATION AND YOU KNOW I DO AGREE WITH YOU THAT THE MORE WE INTERACT AND LEARN FROM EACH OTHER AND THERE'S A LOT THAT'S GOING ON I THINK ACROSS THE STATE. SO THAT WE CAN- NOT COOKIE CUTTER HE CAN'T MAKE A COOKIE CUTTER APPROACH FROM ONE COUNTY TO ANOTHER ISSUE WELL NO BUT ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT YOU CAN WANDER AND THINK ABOUT. WHAT ARE THE LESSONS AND YOU'VE HEARD A FEW OF THEM RIGHT LISTEN CAREFULLY LISTEN CAREFULLY CHECK EVERYBODY COMMUNICATE WITH TRANSPARENCY AND COMMUNICATE OFTEN. BE SURE THAT AS YOU'RE MOVING AS YOU'RE MOVING FORWARD YOU ARE PUTTING SAFETY NUMBER ONE. AND ENSURE THAT. EVERYONE HAS. A VOICE WHETHER IT BE A STUDENT A PARENT A TEACHER A CUSTODY AND- YOU KNOW WHOEVER IT YES NEEDS TO BE PART OF THIS AND THAT'S WHY WHEN YOU LOOK AT OUR SCHOOLS AND THE OPPORTUNITIES TO RE OPEN. IN PERSON THAT EVERYBODY HAS TO BE PART OF THAT CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT. IT LOOKS LIKE TO BE SAFE. I WOULD I WOULD ADAM. I THINK ONE THE MOST OF THING. IS EVERYTHING KEEPS CHANGING STILL AND HOW WE GET BETTER IN EDUCATION AND IN A CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT CYCLE IS BY REFLECTING ON WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING MAKING ADJUSTMENTS AND SEEING WHAT THE IMPACT WAS AND ONE OF THE MOST DIFFICULT TIMES ABOUT IMPROVING ANYTHING THAT WE'RE DOING THIS TIME IS THAT WE KEEP HAVING TO SHIFT BASED ON OUR INVOLVING REALITY OF TRYING TO DO WHATEVER SCHOOL IS. TODAY SO I THINK THAT- YOU KNOW A YEAR FROM NOW WE'RE GOING TO KNOW A LOT MORE HOPEFULLY THINGS WILL BE VERY DIFFERENT IN A YEAR FROM NOW. BUT I WILL JUST OFFERED THAT THAT IS ONE OF THE MOST DIFFICULT- ASPECTS OF THIS WORK RIGHT NOW IS THAT WE ARE CONSTANTLY HAVING TO PLAN FOR THE NEXT THING AND IT'S GIVING US VERY LITTLE TIME TO REFLECT ON WHAT WE'RE DOING RIGHT NOW. SCREECH I THINK I THINK IT'S SAFE TO SAY THAT THE MY COLLEAGUES PROBABLY SHARE THAT THERE WOULD YOU YOU ARE- HAVING TO DEAL WITH SO MANY THINGS IT'S HARD TO REALLY TAKE A AND HAVE THE TIME TO REFLECT SO I WOULD JUST- THAT THE THANK YOU THANK YOU WALL PASSED THE MIKE BACK IN- BUT JUST URGE YOU TO STAY IN TOUCH YOU KNOW SO MUCH OF THIS CLEARLY I SEE DOLLAR SIGNS- WHEN I HEAR DR ME CHERYL TALKING ABOUT THE FACT THAT THEY THEY'VE GOT ALL OF THE STUFF- COMPUTERS AND THE TECHNOLOGY IS THERE AND THAT THERE IS. BROADBAND YOU KNOW WE DON'T HAVE THAT A LOT OF PLACES IN THE STATE CLEARLY A LOT OF WHAT WE NEED TO DO TAKES MONEY- AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO BUT I THINK IT'S REALLY VERY IMPORTANT THAT THERE CONTINUE TO BE THIS DIALOGUE WITH THE LEGISLATURE SO WE KNOW WHAT IT'S GOING TO TAKE TO EDUCATE OUR CHILDREN DURING THIS DIFFICULT TIME BECAUSE FRANKLY I'M WORRIED THAT SO MANY OF OUR KIDS HAVE FALLEN BEHIND- AND- THAT WE NEED TO IDENTIFY WHO THEY ARE THEY FALLING BEHIND ACADEMICALLY EMOTIONALLY- YOU MENTION SAFETY CRITICAL PROBLEMS- THAT. YOU KNOW THAT THEIR SUCH ISOLATION THAT IT'S KIND OF HARD TO TELL SO I JUST WANT TO END UP BY THANKING YOU ALL IN AND ASKING. THAT YOU CONTINUE TO KEEP. US IN IN FOR IS TO YOUR NAY ARE AND HOW WELL YOU'RE DOING AND WHAT MORE YOU NEED IN ORDER TO DO A BETTER. THANK YOU THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THANK SENATOR JACKSON CENTER PAN. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND- I WANT TO THANK ALL THE PRESENTERS AND PARTICULARLY RECOGNIZE- BOTH THE- RUSSIAN AND BROWN AND MELISSA BEST KNOWN WHO ARE IN MY DISTRICT AT SAN JUAN UNIFIED- DO I ASK SOME QUESTIONS ARE BUILDING ON THE QUESTIONS THAT THAT CENTER GONZALEZ AND CENTER HANNAH BETH JACKSON. ALSO ASKED. SO AND I KNOW WHAT THE SUPERINTENDENT CARE SURE YOU MENTIONED THAT IN THE SPRING IN YOUR SCHOOL DISTRICT YOU SAID ABOUT 3240% OF THE KIDS KIND OF DROPPED OFF IN THE SPRING. AND YOU MENTIONED OF COURSE INFRASTRUCTURE. ISSUES NOT NECESSARY BROADBAND BUT OTHER TYPES HOME ISSUES. THAT I GUESS THE QUESTION I HAVE AND MORE BROADLY NOT JUST FOR YOU- SUPERDIMENSION AERO IS THAT. WITH THIS NEW SCHOOL YEAR THIS FALL AND WHEN THE THINGS THAT I JUST WANT PERHAPS. THINK ABOUT IS THAT YOU KNOW IN OUR ROLES. IN IN THE STATE SENATE AND I'M SURE MANY OTHER PEOPLE WE END UP SPENDING A LOT OF TIME ON WHETHER ZOOMS ARE CONFERENCE CALLS AND SO FORTH AND FRANKLY FROM MY OWN PERSONAL EXPERIENCE AND I THINK YOU MAY PEOPLE HAVE ALSO EXPRESSED THIS IT'S- FAIRLY FATIGUING. TO DO THAT TO AFFECT PEOPLE'S BEEN WRITTEN ABOUT. HOW MUCH MORE FATIGUING IT IS TO DO REPEATED ZOOMS AND- CONFERENCE CALLS VERSUS ACTUALLY MEETING IN PERSON- AND- SO. I GUESS. THE TERM SO I GUESS THE QUESTION I HAVE IS I SO YOU MENTIONED THIRTY FORTY PERCENT- AND I'VE HEARD THIS NUMBER FROM OTHER SCHOOL DISTRICTS BEFORE. WHAT IS THE PERCENTAGE OF HAVING THE FALL AND ALSO IS THAT PERCENTAGE INCREASING OR IS IT CHANGING. FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE SCHOOL YEAR THIS FALL TO THIS POINT TITLES ARE WE DEVELOPING. THIS ARE CHRONIC FATIGUE. AMONG STUDENTS AND ALSO PERHAPS ALSO AMONG TEACHERS AS WELL HAVING TO BE ON A SENSUALLY OF VISION YOU KNOW THIS VIRTUAL. MEDIUM FOR HOURS EVERY SINGLE DAY SO THIS IS. IS THIS AN ISSUE THAT YEAR- EXPERIENCING- SEEING AMONGST BOTH THE STUDENTS. AND PERHAPS EVEN THE STAFF THE TEACHERS. AND PERHAPS AND ALSO IF YOU HAVE ANY DATA IN TERMS OF NUMBERS OF WHAT PERCENTAGE OF STUDENTS RIGHT NOW AT THIS STAGE. ARE ACTUALLY OF YOUR EXPECTED ROMAN WHO YOUR CONCERN MAY BE DISENGAGED BECAUSE OF WHATEVER REASON. AT THIS POINT SO SINCE 3040% WAS MENTIONED FOR THE SPRING WAS IT NOW. IT'S AN- LOS DIGIT NOW AND SHAUNA BROWN'S. EARLIER ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP THAT I HAVING EVERY PERSON SEEN AND HEARD. I THINK WAS OUR SUCCESS WE MET WEEKLY WITH PARENT GROUPS. HOW WE MET WEEKLY WITH OUR CLASSIFIED PLAYGROUPS. WE'VE HAD WEEKLY WITH OUR TEACHERS ASSOCIATION AND TEACHER ASKED REACHED FOR. AND THE QUESTION IS WHERE WHERE HOW ARE YOU DOING OUT WHAT ARE YOUR HOPES WANTS AND NEEDS- SOCIALLY EMOTIONALLY AND PROFESSIONALLY. AS IN CONVERSATION WITH FAMILIES WHAT ARE YOUR HOPES AND NEEDS AND WANTS BOTH SOCIALLY EMOTIONALLY. AND ACADEMICALLY FOR THE CHILDREN. AND THE FIRST THOSE CONVERSATION JUST GAVE US THE ANSWERS TO THE PROBLEMS YOU'RE HAVING. ONE OF THE NUMBER ONE CONCERN AS WELL AS OUR EMPLOYEE CHILD CARE. OUR TEACHERS NEEDED TO COME TO WORK BUT THEY'RE ALSO YOU KNOW. PARENTS AND SO HOW DO WE NEED BOTH IT'S HARD TO USES LEARNING JUST BY YOURSELF BUT WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO MANAGE YOUR OWN DISTANCE LEARNING YOUR KIDS. IT'S AN ISSUE. OF FREE CHILDCARE FOR ALL EMPLOYEES IS SOMETHING WE IMPLEMENTED RIGHT AWAY. SOMETHING THAT WILL PROBABLY GIVE US A CALL BACK IF WE CAN FIGURE OUT HOW TO FINANCE IT. JUST TAKES THE STRESS OF WORK- AWAY IN TERMS OF GIVING YOUR FULL ATTENTION TO THE JOB. AND THEN THE SAME CONCERNS. FROM OUR FAMILIES WORK. I NEED TO WORK THAT NOT IN THIS WORKING MY WIFE I BOTH NEED WORK IN THE DON'T HAVE ANY SOLUTION CHILD CARE. THAT'S WHY WE OPEN UP SCHOOLS IN A- TO PROVIDE THE POP CHARTER SO THAT ARE TOWNS NO WORK IN UNDER THOSE. CAN GET THIS IS LEARNING STEP. THE LAST THING THAT WE LEARNED WAS THAT. WE HAD A THANK YOU CAN PROGRAM WITH ARE BLACKWOOD SYSTEM WOULD CALL. AND THEM. FOR A COMMUNITY. WE REALIZE THAT 40% THE PARENTS. OUT OF THIS NEW. SO IT FANS WERE RECEIVING. FROM US AFTER ALL THE MECHANISMS AND WE HAD TO RECONSTITUTE. NEEDS ARE OUR SYSTEM. AROUND A NEW PHONE. I TAX AND EMAIL SYSTEM TO RECONNECT WITH OUR FAMILIES. AND THEN ONE HOME VISIT AT A TIME WE'RE ABLE TO RECONNECT. IT'S JUST THAT A COUPLE KIDS- THAT. PARENTS ARE NOT PUTTING THEIR EDUCATION. AT THE HEART OF. WHAT THEY'RE DOING RIGHT. NOW THAT. ARE THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE. OKAY THANK YOU. L. OF A- MESS BROWN ONE TO SINCE YOU'RE THE EXACT. OF THE TEACHERS. ONE HAD SOME OBSERVATIONS. I DE FIFTEEN ISRAEL I MEAN I THINK EVERYONE ON THIS- CALL CAN ATTEST TO THAT. IT'S I WOULDN'T SAY IT'S NOT JUST THE INNER INTERACTIONS- THAT ARE OCCURRING VIRTUALLY BUT I DO THINK THAT IMPACTS SO AS MUCH AS WE NEED TO ENGAGE WITH EACH OTHER- IT'S NOT THE SAME AS YOU HEARD OTHER PEOPLE SAYING SO- YOU KNOW A LOT OF WHAT FILLS UP EDUCATORS IS THE INTERACTION WITH STUDENTS. AND THAT'S MISSING RIGHT NOW SO THAT IS ABSOLUTELY IMPACTING PEOPLE- I THINK THE OTHER THING IS. D. EDUCATORS ARE HAVING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO TAKE. CONTENT THAT THEY KNOW WELL AND THEY'RE VERY WELL VERSED IN DELIVERING AN IN PERSON FORMAT RIGHT SO AS I MENTIONED EARLIER THERE'S THE DIRECT INSTRUCTION AND THEN I LET MY STUDENTS GO TO INDEPENDENT STUDY WHO KNOW THE WORK AND THEN I CAN PULL EITHER IN. STUDENT OR SMALL GROUPS ON THE BACK OF THE ROOM IN REAL TIME TO MAKE THOSE ADJUSTMENTS THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS- THAT TAKE EXTRA WORK IN A VIRTUAL WORLD BECAUSE YOU CAN'T MAKE THOSE ADJUSTMENTS ON THE FLY- PUTTING THE RESOURCES ONLINE. MAKING THEM ACCESSIBLE AND UNDERSTANDABLE FOR STAFF AND STUDENTS ARE SKEWS ME FOR IT STUDENTS AND PARENTS AND EVERY AGE LEVEL- WE'RE HEARING ON A REGULAR BASIS FROM TEACHERS THAT THEY ARE SPENDING BETWEEN TEN AND TWELVE HOURS A DAY- THAT INCLUDES THE TIME THEY'RE SPENDING WITH STUDENTS AND SYNCHRONOUS BUT IT ALSO IS ALL OF THE GRADING OF ALL OF THE ONLINE THE COMMUNICATION FOLLOWING UP WITH FAMILIES AND STUDENTS. AS WELL AS HAVING TO REFORMAT EVERYTHING TO FIT IN A VIRTUAL WORLD SO THE FIFTEENTH ISRAEL- AND- WERE ABSOLUTELY HEARING ABOUT IT. THANK YOU. BOB I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO TRACK- SO OBVIOUSLY LEARNING IS A- BILL TO A STREET RIGHT WE HAVE STOOD THE LEARNER AND THAT AND THE TEACHER AND SO. HOW BOTH ARE DOING A VERY IMPORTANT AND ONLY GET TO ACCESS THE INTERNET I MEAN SUCH AS THOSE OF. BOTH WAYS. THE OTHER QUESTION I HAD- FOLLOWING UP ON THE DISCUSSION ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH AND- CERTAINLY THAT'S THE- MAJOR ISSUE. TWENTY SO I LIKE TO SHARE NO THE HEALTH COMMITTEE AND BUT JUST LIKE ANY HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES. SO WHAT DEGREE ARE HIS COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH WORKING WITH SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO TRY TO PROVIDE ACCESS TO MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. FOR STUDENTS. SO I KNOW THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE TRYING VERY HARD ON THEIR OWN WITH THEIR OWN RESOURCES AND I APPRECIATE OUT REACH SOME THE COMMUTER ORGANIZATIONS BUT WHAT IS COUNTY BOARD COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS DOING WITH SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE HAD THEY BEEN. ABSENCE AND EFFORTS TO PROVIDE BETTER ACCESS TO MENTAL HEALTH. PARTICULARLY VIRTUALLY FOR STUDENTS WHO HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED AS HAVING CHALLENGES. SO I COULD TAKE MAYBE PART OF THAT SO IN MARIN COUNTY DEFINITELY STRONG RELATIONSHIP WITH COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH. ARE THEY REACHED OUT- AND I THINK IT WAS IN THE SPRING I STARTED DOING A TRAINING ONLINE WEEKLY FOR DIFFERENT. PARENTS AND STUDENTS DIFFERENT EACH. I'M IN MULTIPLE LANGUAGE. BUT IT AVAILABLE IN HAVE. IN ADDITION ARE PART OF OUR OVERALL WELLNESS GROUP AND THEY ARE BRING YOU TO LEVERAGE OUR RESOURCES AND SUPPORT SO THEY'RE DEFINITELY A STRONG PLAYER IN OUR COMMUNITY. OKAY I WOULD SAY WE RECEIVED TREMENDOUS SUPPORT FROM THE COUNTY PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAN DIEGO AND ESPECIALLY THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE DOWN HERE. WHO'S SEEN A RISE AND IN CRIME ABUSE AND- TEEN SUICIDE ATTEMPTS- CHILDREN COMING INTO RADY CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL WITH SCARS AND BRUISES AND THINGS THAT WE WOULD THINK ARGUES THAT ARE NOT IDENTIFIED BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT IN OUR BUILDINGS. THOSE ARE THE THINGS THAT ARE OUR LOCAL EPIDEMIOLOGIST PEDIATRICIANS AND LAW ENFORCEMENT HAVE SAID. ARE THE REASONS THAT THEY SEE SCHOOLS NEED TO BE VERY OPEN TO GET THAT SAME PLACE BACK FOR KIDS. IS ALSO REFLECTED IN OUR PARENT TEACHER TALK IN TERMS OF WHAT YOU'RE ACTUALLY SAYING. WHEN YOU HAVE CONVERSATIONS WITH OUR FAMILIES. DEFINITELY THREE OTHERS ON THE- DEGREE THAT THEY CONTINUE TO BE PARTNERS I THINK THE WE CONTINUE TO FACE CHALLENGES AND NOT GOING BACK TO THE SCREEN TIME AND VIDEO THAT THE ON THE VIRTUAL FORMAT AS THE FORMAT FOR SERVICE DELIVERY AND SO THAT CAN AT TIMES BE THE CHALLENGE IN TERMS OF OUTRAGE BUT THEY ARE VERY MUCH SO PARTNER. WITH US. I WAS JUST GONNA SAY OUR AN- COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH IS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT IN THAT MAYBE WEREN'T WE DON'T HAVE AS MUCH OF A PARTNERSHIP- IN OUR COUNTY AND SO- WHAT WE DO OFFER IS THROUGH OUTREACH SERVICES THAT I'VE BEEN ABLE TO. SEEK ON MY OWN I AM NOT FROM THEM C. KEEN- APPS CELL. THAT'S KIND AN OFF END. ACTOR OKAY NO THANK YOU I AT THE RELY THAT YOU CAN DIFFER BUT ALSO WE CAN HAVE A BROADER EFFORTS AND TO DRIVE THEIR ACTS AND THEN FINALLY- IT'S GOT WORSE SOMEONE MENTIONED ABOUT SOCIAL MEDIA- I GUESS ARE THERE EVER CONCERNS ABOUT YOUR SOCIAL MEDIA CERTAINLY CAN BE USEFUL TOOL BUT ARE THERE ARE CONCERNS ABOUT PRIVACY- YOU KNOW IT'S SO WE'RE NOW NOW DOING STUFF VIRTUALLY AND I KNOW YOU'RE NOT USING SOCIAL MEDIA NECESSARY TO DIRECTLY TO DO TEACHING BUT- IT. IS YOU KNOW IN TERMS OF USING SUCH AS THE SOCIAL MEDIA IS THERE AS A MEDIUM FOR ENGAGING STUDENTS ARE FAMILIES AND ESPECIALLY AROUND SENSITIVE ISSUES LIKE LET'S SAY MENTAL HEALTH BEHAVIOR BETTER. PRIVACY CONCERNS ABOUT THAT. I BELIEVE I WAS THE ONE THAT MENTIONED IT- IN MY- WHEN I WAS SPEAKING AND SO WHEN I SPEAK TERMINAL ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH IN OUR- SOCIAL MEDIA IT'S- OURS COUNSELORS HAVE CREATED- CAL FACEBOOK ACCOUNTS INSTAGRAM ACCOUNTS WHERE IT'S JUST PUSHING MESSAGING OUT TO FAMILIES. WITHOUT THAT RESPONSE BACK SO WE'RE NOT RECEIVING RESPONSES BACK FROM FAMILIES WE ARE ONLY PUSHING MESSAGING OUT. IF THEY WANT TO REACH AS THAN THEY NEEDED SEEK. THROUGH MEANS OF A PHONE CALL OR AN EMAIL THAT WE ARE NOT- GETTING INFORMATION THROUGH OUR SOCIAL MEDIA FROM THE FAMILIES. OKAY THANK YOU THANK YOU. MR MUCH MANAGER THANK YOU SENATOR PAN A SING NO MORE MICROPHONES RAISED IN THE CHAMBER AND NO MORE HANDS RAISED ON THE COMPUTER I HAVE ONE FINAL QUESTION AND THAT'S FOR IS SURELY. AND THIS IS A HARD QUESTION TO ASK WE'VE HEARD ANECDOTALLY THAT SUICIDE RATES AMONG STUDENTS ARE UP. SINCE YOU ARE THE HEAD OF COUNSELING THAT IS ON THIS PANEL I'M GOING TO ASK DIRECTLY IF YOU DO YOU KNOW IF SUICIDE RATES ARE UP IN YOUR SCHOOL DISTRICT OR- IF THE SCHOOL DISTRICT HAS HAD ANY SUICIDE SINCE COVERED. OUR RATES ARE UP AND YES WE HAVE- BUT WHAT WE'RE FINDING IS THAT. IN THE PAST- WE WOULD KNOW IMMEDIATELY BECAUSE THE KIDS WERE CONNECTED THEY WERE SHOWING UP AT SCHOOL OR NOT SHOWING UP AT SCHOOL UNTIL. IT'S BEEN ACTUALLY REALLY DIFFICULT CHALLENGES ON OUR IN DEPTH FIND OUT WHAT'S GOING ON WITHIN THE COMMUNITY BECAUSE- THAT FAMILIES ARE NOT REACHING OUT TO THE SCHOOL SITE TO SAY THE STUDENT IS NOT GOING TO BE ATTENDING SCHOOL TOMORROW BECAUSE OF THIS OR THAT AND SO. AND BUT OUR NUMBERS ARE UP AND YES WE HAVE HAD SUICIDES THIS YEAR. THANK YOU I'M SORRY TO HEAR THAT BUT THANK YOU FOR YOUR HONEST ANSWER. OKAY AT THIS TIME I WOULD LIKE TO TURN THE GAVEL OVER TO CHEER GONZALEZ WHO'S GOING TO PRESIDE OVER OUR SECOND PANEL. THANK YOU TO ALL OF OUR FIRST PANELIST. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. LEYVA FOR YOUR- AMAZING WORK ENOUGH ON THE FIRST PANEL AND I JUST WANNA THINK AS WELL- ALL OF THE STAKEHOLDERS. AND EDUCATORS WHO SPOKE TO US AND GIVE US THEIR INCREDIBLE INSIGHT- YOUR WORK IS DEFINITELY APPRECIATED.

ACCESS CODE FOUR FIVE SEVEN. SEVEN FIVE FIVE NINE. OUR SECOND PANEL IS GOING TO TALK WITH US ABOUT ACCESS TO THE INTERNET.

IN FINDING WAYS FOR US TO BE MORE INCLUSIVE HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. ARE VERY FIRST PANELIST ME THANK HIM SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE AND IS PATIENTS AS WELL. WE'LL BE STATE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION TONY THURMOND WELCOME MR SUPERINTENDENT. THANK YOU SENATOR- GONZALEZ THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU SENATOR LEYVA. UP FOR TODAY'S HEARING INTO ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE JOINT COMMITTEE- IT HAS BEEN HELPFUL TO YOU HERE- THE HEARING PROCEEDINGS. I WANT TO THANK ALL THE MEMBERS WHO WERE PARTICIPATING TODAY- FOR. LEARNING LOSS MITIGATION FUND THAT'S BEEN PROVIDED TO OUR SCHOOLS- BETWEEN YOU AND THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE THIS MEANS FIVE POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS- THAT CAN BE USED. TO SUPPORT- DEVICES INTERNET AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE. FOR OUR STUDENTS- AGAIN I WANT TO START BY ALSO SPEAKING TO SOME OF THE THEMES THAT MANY OF YOU HAVE SPOKEN TO. AS YOU STARTED OUT TODAY ETHNOLOGY OUR STUDENTS. ARE EDUCATORS AND THEIR FAMILIES FOR THEIR RESILIENCE- THIS IS AN INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT TIME PROBABLY THE MOST DIFFICULT THAT WE WILL SEE. OUR LIFETIME AS I HEAR FROM EDUCATORS AND STUDENTS. ALL OVER THE STATE EVERYONE IS LEANING IN AS HARD AS THEY CAN. TO MAKE THIS WORK I THINK MANY OF YOU KNOW THAT OUR SCHOOLS OPEN THIS FALL WITH NINETY SEVEN PERCENT. OF OUR SCHOOLS OPENING IN DISTANCE LEARNING- IF YOU LOOK AT THE TOP TWENTY FIVE LARGEST SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN THE STATE MOST OF THEM CONTINUE. TO BE IN DISTANCE LEARNING I THINK MAYBE TWO AS I LOOK AT THE LIST IN FRONT OF ME- MAYBE TO- HAVE ACTUALLY UP PROVIDE HAVE OPENED WHILE MANY OF THOSE AT. LARGER DISTRICTS ARE IN DISTANCE LEARNING SOME OF THEM HAVE SMALL COHORTS AS HAS BEEN ALLOWED BY THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH ALSO BY THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT. OF PUBLIC HEALTH WE KNOW THAT WE NOW HAVE OF METRICS FOR HELPING SCHOOL DISTRICTS MAKE DECISIONS WHEN IT MAY BE SAFER TO OPEN. AND WHEN IT'S ABSOLUTELY NOT SAFE TO OPEN UP MORE THAN 40% OF OUR DISTRICTS CONTINUE TO BE- IN PURPLE- ZONES WHICH MAY KNOW UP MEANS THAT THEY CANNOT OPEN. AT THIS TIME- I WANT. TO THANK US LATER MCGUIRE NOW OTHERS WHO SERVED IN SENATOR LEYVA UP FOR YOUR SERVICE ON THE TASK. AND I BE NAY AND THE DEAL DIVIDE I YOU CENTER AGAIN. FOR YOUR LEGISLATION TO WHICH THE DIVIDE IN THE GOING FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU- AS YOU SAY IN THIS INTEREST THAT YOU HAVE. WELL FOR GOING FORWARD. AT THIS TIME WE IT'LL ARE STILL OPERATING OFF OF THE ASSUMPTION THAT MAYBE A MILLION STUDENTS MAYBE A MILLION AND A HALF STUDENTS IN CALIFORNIA. ARE WITHOUT COMPUTING DEVICES OR INTERNET OR BOTH THIS IS AN EMBARRASSMENT. TO ME FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FOR OUR NATION THAT WE HAVE ALLOWED THIS DIGITAL DIVIDE TO EXIST WE KNOW THAT STUDENTS TO RULE COMMUNITIES CONTINUE TO BE. WITHOUT THE INFRASTRUCTURE THEY NEED TO PROVIDE ACCESS TO THE INTERNET AND IT IS MY BELIEF THAT THE INTERNET IS SO SLOW LIKE. ELECTRICITY AND WE WANT TO WORK WITH YOU AND OTHERS TO MAKE. APRIL AND REALLY SINCE MARCH WE WORK WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE IN THE FIRST PARTNER AND FOUNDATIONS MANY OF YOU WHO HELPED TO SECURE DONATIONS IN THE EARLY DAYS. WE RECEIVED A HUNDRED THOUSAND COMPUTING DEVICES ANOTHER HUNDRED THOUSAND HOT SPOTS- BUT THAT JUST WASN'T ENOUGH- THE NATION HAS BEEN EXPERIENCING A SHORTAGE OF COMPUTING DEVICES IN HOT SPOTS. IT'S SO MANY OF OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAVE BEEN A WAITING LIST WAITING TO GET THE LATEST ROUND OF DEVICES TO BE A BILL TO THEM. WHEN I THINK MY STAFF AND OTHERS LIKE MERRY NICELY WORK LITERALLY WITH MANUFACTURERS ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY TO MAKE ANOTHER FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DEVICES AVAILABLE TO OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS FOR PURCHASE WITH THEIR LEARNING LOSS MITIGATION FUNDS. AND I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE PARTNERSHIP WITH APPLE IN T. MOBILE THAT HAS MADE ANOTHER MILLION AND A HALF THE PRICE IS AVAILABLE TO OUR STUDENTS THESE ARE DEVICES THAT. ARE INTERNET ENABLED THEY'RE SOLD AT A REDUCED COST AND IF THEY ARE AVAILABLE TO OUR STUDENTS AT A TIME WHEN THERE'S A SHORTAGE ON AVAILABLE DEVICES I LIKE TO ALSO- THANK THE INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS IN OUR STATE. AND AGAIN CENTER LEYVA CENTER INQUIRE WHO WORK WITH US- TO SAY TO THEM LOOK YOU'VE GOT TO PROVIDE FREE INTERNET AND IN MANY IT IN MANY CASES. AND CERTAINLY LOW COST INTERNET FOR THOSE WHO QUALIFY I'M IN THERE DOING THAT AT ABOUT TEN DOLLARS A MONTH FOR MANY OF OUR FAMILIES. WE'VE ASKED THEM TO DO THAT WITHOUT PROVIDING. ANY HOOPS TO JUMP THROUGH NOT ASKING FAMILIES TO YOU KNOW PROVIDE THEIR CREDIT HISTORY NOT ASKING FOR SOCIAL-SECURITY NUMBER- AND THEY'VE DONE THAT THEY PROVIDED LIAISONS THAT FAMILIES CAN CALL. TO GET HELP GETTING ACCESS TO THESE PROGRAMS BUT YET WE STILL SEE CHALLENGES THAT EXIST FOR MANY OF OUR FAMILIES AND WE INTEND TO USE THE TASK FORCE AND WORKING CLOSELY WITH YOU. TO ADDRESS MANY OF THOSE EVEN IN THE TASK FORCE WE FOUND UP IN SOME CASES STATE GOVERNMENT HAS CONTRIBUTED TO THE DELAY TO BUILDING INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS THAT WILL ALLOW. FOR BROADBAND IN SO WE'VE USED TASK FORCE TO ESTABLISH A BETTER WORKING RELATIONSHIP WITH CALTRANS THEY HAVE A WAY TO- HUNT. FOR PROJECTS THAT NEED TO BE EXPEDITED AND IF THEY'RE PER. ISSUES WORK THROUGH. SO THAT WE CAN NEXT. THOSE PROJECTS I WANT TO THANK EVERY AGENCY THAT HAS HELPED- TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS CRAIG COMING FROM- THE DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION. THE CALIFORNIA TELEKINETIC- IF FOLKS THAT ALLOWED FOR EIGHTY SIX THOUSAND HOT SPOTS TO GO TO THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY. RULE AND SMALL- DISTRICTS FIVE MILLION DOLLARS COMING FROM THE CALIFORNIA ADVANCED SERVICES FUND. THAT PROVIDED DEVICES IN HOT SPOTS AT FOURTEEN SCHOOL DISTRICTS AGAIN OUR INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS HAVE STEPPED UP TO PROVIDE TO REDUCE COST. INTERNET TO OUR K. TWELVE. FAMILIES AND ALSO TO HIGHER EDUCATION STUDENTS MANY OF WHOM ARE FINANCIALLY INSECURE FOOD INSECURE BUT THEY'RE ALSO. IN DISTANCE LEARNING THEIR STILL MANY MANY CHALLENGES. WE DON'T HAVE INTERNET IN OUR RULE COMMUNITIES THIS IS A CHALLENGE. WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE INTERNET TAXES FAMILIES ARE TRYING HARD. TO ADDRESS THE INTERNET MULTIPLE PEOPLE IN ONE HOME AND SOMETIMES THEY JUST GET KNOCKED OFF A RESUME. IN SO WE KNOW THAT OUR INTERNET COMPANIES ARE GOING TO HAVE TO HELP US TO ADDRESS THESE GAPS. WHEN I THINK DR GARY MICHELSON ENGINE AND TECH WHO'VE COME FORWARD TO HELP US IN CREATING WHAT WE'RE GONNA BE ANNOUNCING A NEW. INNOVATION COMPETITION- SENATOR LEYVA NINE TO. FORCE MEMBER WILL BE TALKING ABOUT THIS. THIS A WAY FOR US TO GET THOSE TO DO RESEARCH TO THOSE WHO ARE ENTREPRENEURS THOSE WHO ARE INNOVATORS. TO COME UP WITH A NEW TYPE OF TECHNOLOGY OR WASTE TO HELP US ADDRESS- THE LACK OF INTERNET IN OUR STATE COME UP WITH NEW SOLUTIONS AND CUTTING EDGE. SOLUTIONS TO DO THAT WILL BE OFFERED A CASH CRISIS HELP MAKE THAT HAPPEN. PROVIDE SOME INCENTIVES TO COMPANIES AND RESEARCHERS AND INNOVATORS TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN. FOR OUR STUDENTS AND SO- WE'RE DIGGING IT ON ALL THE THINGS THAT YOU ALL ARE TALKING ABOUT TODAY. TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR STUDENTS HAVE THE TOOLS TO LEARN AND ALSO THE TOOLS TO BE CONNECTED WITH CANCERS BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT RIGHT NOW MORE THAN EVER. OUR STUDENTS NEED ACCESS TO SOCIAL. LEARNING IS SOMETIMES THE ONLY WAY THEY CAN GET ACCESS. TO A COUNSELOR IS TO TELL THE HEALTH WE'VE CREATED A COUNSELING. THIS OF THAT SPEAKS TO OF OUR- NAY WHERE THEY CAN. CALL THE NUMBER ANY IS. YOU GET CONNECT. TO A SHORTER RESOURCE THE FIELD WILL BE WORKING WITH US THIS TO DO WHAT YOU HEARD EARLIER TODAY FROM THE COME HOME VALLEY DISTRICT. A DIFFERENT TYPE OF FAMILY ENGAGEMENT. IF OUR FAMILIES DON'T HAVE COMPUTERS WE CAN EXPECT THEM TO RESPOND TO THE INTERNET. AND SO WE WANT TO WORK WITH OUR DISTRICTS TO ADDRESS ISSUES AROUND FAMILY ENGAGEMENT. WE DON'T WANT IGNORE THE PANDEMIC OF RACISM THE MANMADE PANDEMIC WHERE% YOUNG PEOPLE SEE POLICE BRUTALITY IN RACIST ACTS OCCURRING. ON THEIR TELEVISION SCREEN EVERY SINGLE DAY. OUR OFFICE PROVIDED MORE THAN A HUNDRED WEAPON ARE SINCE THE PANDEMIC. I STARTED TO EXAMINE EVERY WAY TO DELIVER EDUCATION TO DISTANCE LEARNING TO EVEN PROVIDING SUPPORT. TO OUR STUDENTS THAT TO HAVING CONVERSATIONS ABOUT ANTI RACISM. WILL BE MAKING AN ANNOUNCEMENT THIS WEEK OF. A NEARLY A DOZEN NEW SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE PROVIDING. MANY GRANT TO DO A MORE PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT AROUND ADDRESSING- OUR- OUR NEEDS AS IT RELATES TO ANTI RACISM WORKING ANTI BIAS WORK. I THANK ALL OF OUR SCHOOL DISTRICT EMPLOYEES FOR THEIR WORK- AT THE HEIGHT OF THE PANDEMIC MORE THAN FIVE THOUSAND SITES PROVIDING MEALS WE KNOW THAT OUR FAMILIES. CONTINUE TO STRUGGLE I WANT TO THANK ALL OF OUR COUNTY HEALTH OFFICERS AND- OTHERS WHO COME TOGETHER WITH OUR COUNTY SUPERINTENDENTS. TO TALK NEW IDEAS AROUND MORE TESTING- TO TALK THROUGH HOW WE KEEP OUR FAMILY SAFE- WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS UNTIL WE- ADDRESS THE DIGITAL DIVIDE ONCE AND FOR ALL. IN OUR LIFETIME I THANK THE MEMBERS OF THESE TWO COMMITTEES FOR YOU COMING TOGETHER TO ADDRESS THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE. AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWERING YOUR QUESTIONS AT ANY TIME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR SUPERINTENDENT AND I KNOW YOU HAVE BEEN LEANING INTO THIS ISSUE LIKE NO OTHER AND WE REALLY APPRECIATE THE COMPREHENSIVE REPORT AND AT THE INCREDIBLE WORK OF THE DIGITAL. DIVIDE TASK FORCE INCLUSIVE OF SENATOR LEYVA AND SENATOR MCGUIRE I THINK THEM FOR THEIR WORK AS WELL. WE APPRECIATE THAT PRESENTATION- NEXT WE HAVE. A MARTHA WHO'S MON I SERVICE COMMISSIONER AT CAL PUBLIC. COMMISSION COMMISSION WE THANK HER FOR BEING HERE WELCOME COMMISSIONER ASSET GOODMAN A SERVICE. THANK YOU CHAIRWOMAN GONZALEZ SENT THANK YOU CHAIRWOMAN LEYVA AND ALL OF THE SENATORS AS YOU KNOW AND AS AS SUPERINTENDENT THURMOND JUST MENTIONED THAT YOU SEE HAS BEEN VERY INVOLVED IN WORKING WITH- DEPARTMENT EDUCATION ON SOME OF THE FUNDS THAT HE'D MENTIONED. BUT FIRST I DO WANT TO STOP IN A KNOWLEDGE ALL THE SUPERINTENDENTS FOR THEIR AMAZING WORK WE'VE HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF TRYING TO COOPERATE WITH SOME OF THEM. THEY ARE REALLY- BEING AS INNOVATIVE AS THEY CAN BE EVERYWHERE FROM FRESNO MODERATE MADERA SACRAMENTO YOU NAME IT WE'VE BEEN. TRYING TO DO A LITTLE BIT OF HELP BUT I I'M REALLY GRATEFUL TO BE HERE TODAY TO SHARE SOME OF MY RECOMMENDATIONS BECAUSE THEY'RE CARRYING A BURDEN THAT THEY SHOULDN'T BE AND WE REALLY NEED SOME LEGISLATIVE ACTION TO HELP NOT JUST OUR CHILDREN BUT ALL OF OUR COMMUNITIES TO HAVE ACCESS TO THE INTERNET. ONE THING IN SEAKING TO MANY OF THESE- SUPERINTENDENTS THAT WE ALL AGREE ON. IS THAT HOT SPOTS ARE A SHORT TERM SOLUTION. AS SUPERINTENDENT THURMOND MENTIONED ALTHOUGH WE WERE ABLE TO PARTNER WITH SEAT WITH THE TAX CALIFORNIA TELL CONNECT FUND. TO EXPAND OUR SOME OF THE FUNDING FOR PARTICULAR SMALL MEDIUM SCHOOLS IT'S JUST A BANDAID- THIS IS WHAT IS REALLY IMPORTANT I JUST WANT TO HIGHLIGHT SOME OF THE THINGS THAT SUPERINTEND ALREADY MENTIONED. THEY DON'T ALWAYS WORK EVERYWHERE THE HOT SPOTS AS THE NUMBER ONE PROBLEM FOR. SOME OF THE KIDS THAT WERE MOST CONCERNED ABOUT THAT ARE STILL BEING LEFT BEHIND. IN ADDITION THE SHARING OF THE DEVICES LEADS TO BANNED WITH ISSUES AND OF COURSE THE DATA CAPS IS JUST NOT A LONG TERM SOLUTION. THE REAL SOLUTION THAT I REALLY WANT TO ENGAGE ALL OF YOU TODAY IN THIS NEXT LEGISLATIVE YEAR. IS THAT WE NEED TO GOVERN THE INTERNET AS THE ESSENTIAL SERVICE THAT IT IS. IT IS A UTILITY THIS IS CENTRAL SERVICE NEEDS TO BE REGULATED LIKE ONE AND LEGISLATOR LIKE ONE. IRONICALLY WE HAVE LONG STANDING STATE AND FEDERAL LAW THAT REQUIRES OUR TELEPHONE VOICE CARRIERS FOR THE VOICE SERVICE. TO HAVE TO REALLY CRITICAL MANDATES ONE IS THAT THEY HAVE TO SERVE ALL CUSTOMERS IN A DESIGNATED AREA. WE REFER TO THIS TERM AS THE CARRIER OF LAST RESORT WE DO NOT HAVE THAT MANDATE FOR THE INTERNET AND WE DESPERATELY. NEEDED THE WE NEED. PERSONALLY I THE MOST EXPEDITIOUS AND% COMPREHENSIVE WAY TO GOVERN IN THIS APPROACH WOULD BE TO REQUIRE THAT CABLE COMPANIES TO BE THE CARRIERS OF LAST RESORT IN THEIR DESIGNATED AREAS. SO THAT ALL CUSTOMERS HAVE THE INTERNET SERVICE VAILABLE TO THEM AND TO HAVE IT AT AN AFFORDABLE RATE. AS I MENTIONED ALSO HISTORICALLY AND NOW TELEPHONE VOICE CARRIERS HAVE THE MANDATE OF CARRIER OF LAST RESORT. BUT THEY'RE ALSO MANDATED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE CALIFORNIA LIFELINE PROGRAM WHICH PROVIDES AFFORDABLE PLANS FOR VOICE. NO SUCH MANDATE EXISTS FOR INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS. THESE PROTECTIONS TO OBLIGATE TO SERVE AND TO HAVE AFFORDABLE PLANS FOR LOW INCOME CUSTOMERS. DON'T EXIST IN THE INTERNET SPACE BECAUSE WE HAVE USED ALLOWS A FAIR APPROACH FOR THE LAST COUPLE DECADES THAT THE FREE MARKET FREE OF THESE TYPES OF OBLIGATION WAS GONNA SOMEHOW ADDRESS THESE- ON THESE DISPARITIES THAT EXISTED. IN FACT THEY'VE CAUSED A GREATER DISPARITY. AS AN EXAMPLE JUST WANNA SHARE RECENT- INTERACTIONS THAT WE'VE HAD WITH EIGHTEEN T. ON THEIR FUTURE TO INVESTING COMMUNITIES AND THEY'VE BEEN VERY CLEAR THAT THEY PLAN TO RETIRE THEIR DSL SERVICE AND THAT THEY HAVE NO REAL UPGRADES TO AGREE THAT DSL TO FIBER ESPECIALLY NOT IN THE AREAS WHERE DOESN'T ALREADY EXIST. IN SOME AREAS WHAT THEY'RE PROPOSING IS TO PROVIDE NON FIXED INTERNET SERVICE AND THIS IS A WIRELESS BROADBAND SERVICE WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT THAT'S A SUBSTITUTE FOR WIRELINE INTERNET SERVICE FOR MUCH OF THE SAME REASONS THAT I MENTION WITH THE HOT SPOTS. SOME AREAS OF CALIFORNIA WILL BE LEFT WITH NOTHING NO ALL DSL NO FIBER UPGRADES NO CABLE AND NO MOBILE WIRELESS WE NEED TO ADDRESS THE SAME WE DESPERATELY NEED THE LEGISLATURE TO ACT. STUDY AFTER STUDY HAS FOUND THAT COMPANIES LIKE AT&amp;T AND COMCAST ARE RED LINING COMMUNITIES BOTH RURAL AND URBAN BECAUSE THEY HAVE NO OBLIGATION TO SERVE THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY. A RECENT REPORT FROM THE NATIONAL DIGITAL INCLUSION ASSOCIATION FOUND THIS PROBLEM TO BE NATION WIDE FOR A. T. AND T. THE MEDIAN INCOME FOR HOUSEHOLDS WITH ACCESS TO FIBER WAS 34% HIGHER. AND THEN IN THE AREAS WITH DSL ONLY. AN IN CALIFORNIA AT AND T. IS ONLY DEPLOYING FIBER 210% OR LESS HOUSEHOLDS IN RURAL COUNTIES SUCH AS KINGS TO WARY AND MADERA. ANOTHER STUDY BY THE ANNENBERG RESEARCH NETWORK ON INTERNATIONAL COMMUNICATIONS WERE USC RESEARCHER AND NONE. I GOT BUILDING. THIS LAST YEAR DID A STUDY ON WHO GETS ACCESS TO FAST BROADBAND IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY. THE FINDING INDICATED THAT FIBER SERVICES ARE LESS LIKELY TO BE OFFERED IN LOW INCOME AREAS WITH COMMUNITIES OF COLOR WITH THE MOST SEVERE DEFICITS IN AREAS THAT HAVE BLACK RESIDENTS LIVING IN POVERTY. IN JUNE OF THIS YEAR ANOTHER STUDY BY GREEN LIGHTING THE GREEN LINING INSTITUTE THEY SHARED THEIR FINDINGS OF COMMUNITIES IN AND NEAR OAKLAND LACKING HIGH SPEED INTERNET ACCESS AND IT CLOSELY RESEMBLED A MAP OF THE REDLINING THAT OCCURRED IN HOUSING FROM THE NINETEEN THIRTIES. HERE AT THE DO YOU SEE AS I MENTIONED WE HEAR FROM INDIVIDUAL COMMUNITIES ALL THE TIME IN THESE LAST TWO WEEKS ALONE I PERSONALLY HAVE MET WITH COMMUNITIES IN CINEMA COUNTY. MENDOCINO COUNTY MONTEREY COUNTY FRESNO COUNTY AND COMMUNITIES ALL IN BETWEEN AND THE ISSUES RUN THE GAMUT MOST OF THE TIME THERE'S FIBER GOING THROUGH THE COMMUNITY AND THEY HAVE NO ACCESS OR THE FIBER GOES WITH ANY CABLE SERVICE HALF OF THE COMMUNITIES LIKE HIM BY ALLAH. AND THE OTHER HALF DOESN'T HAVE IT. OR LIKE THE COMMUNITY AND SIGNED HER ARE THE MONTEREY WAS SHOWING SERVICE BUT THE COMMUNITY DOESN'T HAVE IT. ALL OF THESE COMMUNITIES HAVE CHILDREN CHILDREN ARE FALLING BEHIND AND THE SUPERINTENDENTS ARE TRYING TO DO EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO GET IT. RESOLVED BUT THEY CANNOT DO IT ALONE. THIS IS A YOU KNOW WE COME TO A POINT HERE WHERE WE HAVE. THE TRIED AN APPROACH OF OFFERING INCENTIVES AND USING THE MARKET FORCES TO TRY TO CLOSE THE DIGITAL DIVIDE BUT WE'RE PAST THAT POINT WE NEED TO REQUIRE THESE COMMUNITIES TO BE SERVED AND THAT THEY BE SERVED THE SAME QUALITY AT AN AFFORDABLE RATE. IT'S TOO LATE IT'S TOO IS JUST INSUFFICIENT NOW TO. ON A ALONE IN TWO THOUSAND AND SIX THE DIGITAL INFRASTRUCTURE AND VIDEO COMPETITION ACT KNOWN AS DIFFICULT. THE CHANGE IT CHANGE THE CABLE FRANCHISE LICENSING TO BE ISSUED BY US THE CPUC INSTEAD OF LOCAL CITIES AND COUNTIES. DIFFICULT TO THE AUTHORITY FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WITHOUT PROVIDING THE P. YOU SEE ANY AUTHORITY TO ENFORCE AGAINST THIS CRITICAL TYPE OF REGULATING WE CANNOT INSURE THAT. IN EACH COMMUNITY EVERYONE GETS SERVED OR EVEN I EACH COUNTY LEVEL THAT THERE'S NO REDLINING. THIS IS A MAJOR PROBLEM AND I REALLY CALL ON THE LEGISLATURE TO TAKE THIS ON. THANK YOU SIR. OKAY. THANK YOU COMMISSIONER I I'LL LET YOU GO AHEAD AND FINISH WE HAVE ABOUT FIVE MINUTES FOR EACH PERSON WE GAVE A LITTLE BIT MORE TIME TO GO RIGHT OKAY THANK YOU CHIRLA AND I'M SORRY TO BE SO ANIMATED SUS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY I JUST WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE BY SAYING WE CANNOT LEAVE THIS TO THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS WE NEED TO PROVIDE MORE FUNDING AND I KNOW YOU ARE% A LEADER IN EXTENDING THE CALIFORNIA ADVANCED SERVICES FUND WE NEED TO FIND THAT SAFETY NET AND WE ALSO NEED TO MANDATE THESE REQUIREMENTS OF THE INCUMBENTS THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU SO MUCH COMMISSIONER AND I APPRECIATE THE SOLUTIONS THAT YOU PROVIDED AND I KNOW THAT YOU'RE ALSO TO VERY VERY COMMITTED I'VE TALKED WITH THE MULTIPLE TIMES AND I JUST REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR INSIGHT HERE. AND WHAT MORE WE CAN DO TO IMPROVE- THE SITUATION FOR ALL OF OUR CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS THANK YOU VERY MUCH I'M NEXT PANELIST IS CAROLYN MCINTYRE PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA CABLE AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS ASSOCIATION IS MCINTYRE THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH US. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS- CAROLYN MCINTYRE. I'M HAPPY TO BE HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CABLE AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRY- MEMBERS OF OUR ASSOCIATION FAST INVEST HEAVILY IN CALIFORNIA'S. BROADBAND INFRASTRUCTURE HAVING INVESTED MORE THAN FORTY BILLION DOLLARS IN CALIFORNIA. SINCE NINETEEN NINETY SIX. ARE THE MEMBERS OF THE ASSOCIATION WHICH I WILL POINT OUT. DO NOT INCLUDE AT&amp;T GIVEN THE EXAMPLE CITED BY THE COMMISSIONER. OF THE MEMBERS OF OUR ASSOCIATION HOWEVER DO SERVE. ABOUT EIGHT LONG AND INTERNET SERVICE CUSTOMERS IN STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I'M IN ADDITION TO DELIVERING FASTER RELIABLE INTERNET SERVICE TO BUSINESSES AND RESIDENTIAL CUSTOMERS. CCJ MEMBER COMPANIES TO VOLUNTARILY OFFER PLANS. TO EXTEND INTERNET SERVICE FOR LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS IN FAMILIES. WITH STUDENTS THAT ARE NOW LEARNING FROM HUB. AT THE CABLE INDUSTRY HAS ACTUALLY BEEN OFFERING IS LOW INCOME INTERNET PROGRAMS. LONG BEFORE THE CURRENT PANDEMIC AND I WILL NOW WITHOUT. ANY GOVERNMENT SUBSIDIES. UNDER THESE PLAY THAT ARE SEARCH PROVIDER I'M SERVICE AT A COST THAT RANGES BETWEEN NINE NINETY FIVE IN SEVENTEEN NINETY FIVE PER MONTH. FOR FAMILIES WITH THE STUDENT IN GRADES K. THROUGH TWELVE WHO QUALIFIED FOR THE FEDERAL FREE LUNCH OR REDUCED LUNCH PROGRAM OR AND NOW THEIR SOCIAL SERVICE PROGRAM I LIKE HOW FRESH IT JUST DEPENDS ON THE COMPANY. I'M IN ADDITION TO OUR ON GOING LOW INCOME INTERNET ACCESS PLANS IN RESPONSE TO THE PANDEMIC SOME OF THE COMPANIES HAVE ACTUALLY IMPLEMENTED ADDITIONAL SPECIAL OFFERINGS FOR NEW CUSTOMERS THAT PROVIDE FOR TWO FREE MONTHS OF SERVICE FOR. CUSTOMERS THAT QUALIFY FOR THE FREE REDUCED LUNCH PROGRAM. END FOR NEW CUSTOMER COLLEGE STUDENTS AND IN SOME CASES EDUCATORS. SO I'D ALSO LIKE TO MENTION ANOTHER STRATEGY THAT WAS ACTUALLY UNDERTAKEN AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL FOR THE INDUSTRY- THE CABLE INDUSTRY IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE EDUCATION SUPERHIGHWAY- BASICALLY IS ESTABLISH THE FRAMEWORK FOR A PROGRAM CALLED K. THROUGH TWELVE. BRIDGE TO BRIBERY AND THAT BASICALLY ESTABLISHES A FRAMEWORK FOR THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND THE CABLE INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS TO WORK TOGETHER TO IDENTIFY POPULATIONS- STUDENT POPULATIONS THAT STILL DO NOT HAVE INTERNET CONNECTIVITY. UNDER THE STRUCTURE OF THE PROGRAM ULTIMATELY THE SCHOOL DISTRICT WOULD ENTER INTO AN AGREEMENT WITH THE INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER TO. PROVIDE PROVIDE FOR WHAT WE REFER TO EIGHT IS A SPONSORED SERVICE AGREEMENT AND I WILL NOTE THAT A SPONSORED SERVICE AGREEMENT CAN BE ENTERED INTO YOUR BY. ANY ORGANIZATION OR ANY INDIVIDUAL EVEN THAT WHAT LIGHT. TO TAKE IT UPON THEM SOUTH TO NEGOTIATE CON. AND TO PAY FOR A SERVICE ON TWO INCH. BROADBAND CONNECTED TO CERTAIN POPPED UNDER THE STRUCTURE OF THIS PROGRAM AND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FOR EXAMPLE COULD ACTUALLY ENTER INTO AN AGREEMENT WITH INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS- TO PROVIDE SERVICE TO WHATEVER POPULATION THEY IDENTIFIED- AND PRACTICALLY HAVE THESE POPULATIONS CONNECTED OVERNIGHT. SO THERE ARE OPTIONS OUT THERE- AVAILABLE- AND ONLY THAT AND WHILE WE DO NOT AGREED WITH THE COMMISSIONER OF THAT PRODUCT AND SERVICE NEEDS TO BE REGULATED AS A UTILITY WE DO IT KNOWLEDGE THAT THERE IS MUCH WORK TO BE DONE IN CALIFORNIA. FOR IMPROVING BROADBAND AVAILABILITY THROUGHOUT THE STATE- IT STARTED WITH PROGRAMS THAT ARE CURRENTLY UNDER WAY AT THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION CALIFORNIA ADVANCED SERVICES FUND AND AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL THE REGIONAL DIGITAL OPPORTUNITY FIND BOTH OF FOR EACH WELL DEPLOYED PROVIDE FUNDING TO DEPLOY. BROADBAND SERVICE TOO MANY AT THE HOUSEHOLDS IN THE STATE THAT ARE CURRENTLY IN ME. BUT THE ULTIMATELY THE SOLUTION HERE IS IN FACT I'M GOING TO BE ADDITIONAL PRIVATE INVESTMENT BY MEMBERS THAT OUR ASSOCIATION AS WELL AS MANY OTHER COMPETITORS IN THE INDUSTRY- AS WELL AS THE PUBLIC SUBSIDIES THAT WOULD BE AVAILABLE TO THOSE AREAS ARE TO THOSE COMMUNITIES. WHERE IT'S HARD TO DEPLOY OR FOR MANY CHALLENGES THAT CURRENTLY EXIST THERE AND IS NOT CURRENTLY SERVICE BEING PROVIDED AT THE TWENTY FIVE IN THREE LEVELS- I WILL ALSO NOTE HOWEVER THAT I ASKED THAT THE LEGISLATURE IN CONSIDERING BROADBAND DEPLOYMENT. LOOK TO ELIMINATE BARRIERS TO PERMITTING- INCLUDING BY REQUIRING STATE AND LOCAL AGENCIES TO EXPEDITE AND STREAMLINE. PERMITTING ACCESS THAT HAVE OFTEN DOWN BROUGHT PROJECT PROHIBIT LOW GOVERNMENT FROM EXCESSIVE. AND REQUIRE SPECIFIC TIME. FOR AT INVESTOR ON YOUR OR OTHER OWNERS BROWN ACTS TO THE POLLS FOR BROADBAND DEPLOYMENT PURPOSES. LAST LATE I'LL SAY WELL THERE'S MUCH TO BE DONE AND I DO WANT TO MAKE SURE TO MENTION THAT WE ALSO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT ADDITIONAL WORK NEEDS TO BE DONE IN THE BROADBAND ADOPTION AND DIGITAL LITERACY SPACE. THAT IS ONE OF THE PRIMARY REASONS WHY OUR MEMBER COMPANIES DO IN FACT PROVIDE BROADBAND SERVICES FOR CERTAIN POPULATIONS AT A LOWER COST. BUT THERE'S ALSO A LOT OF WORK TO BE DONE IN THE SPACE OF RECOGNIZING HOW TO USE THE TECHNOLOGY AND EDUCATING SON FAMILIES ON THE FACT THAT THE TECHNOLOGY IS IN FACT A PART OF OUR EVERYDAY LIVES. AND WE NEED TO UNDERTAKE DIGITAL LITERACY EFFORTS TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYBODY GETS THE BENEFIT OF THE TECHNOLOGY SO THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY AND I. LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISS MCINTYRE PRIEST YOUR- INSIGHT AS WELL I KNOW YOU'VE WORKED VERY HARD WITH MANY OF US IN THE LEGISLATURE TO FIND SOLUTIONS. AND SPECIFICALLY THE POINT OF DIGITAL LITERACY IS A HEARD LOUD AND CLEAR AND I KNOW PEOPLE HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT. NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM DANE JASPER THE C. E. O. OF SONIC A TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPANY AN INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER BASED IN SANTA ROSA CALIFORNIA- MISTER JASPER YOU CAN GO RIGHT AHEAD THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY SONIC IS A- COMPETITIVE INTERNET ACCESS PROVIDER FOCUSED ON FIVE THE HOME SERVICES. EIGHT MILLION SEVEN SISCO BAY AREA TODAY. AND WE SERVE ABOUT A QUARTER OF A MILLION CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS TODAY. AND WE ARE SIMILAR TO- COMPANIES LIKE GOOGLE FIBER AND TAKING INTERNET AND METRO IN THAT IN THAT WE'RE A NEW MARKET ENTRANTS- BUILDING TODAY EXCLUSIVELY FIBER THE HOME NETWORKS. WE WITH THE BEGINNING A PANDEMIC- WE LAUNCHED A COVERT NINETEEN PROGRAM AND- AND THAT PROGRAM OFFERS A COMPLETELY FREE ACCESS TO OUR GIGABIT FIBER SERVICE SO THAT'S A ONE THOUSAND MEGABIT SERVICE- TO T. K. THROUGH TWELVE STUDENTS COLLEGE STUDENTS. US SENIORS ESSENTIAL WORKERS. WORKERS AND HEALTH CARE WORKERS AND DELIVERY AND GROCERY. OF THE CHALLENGES THAT THAT PROGRAM IS JUST A FEW MONTHS LONG IT ONLY PROVIDES A FEW MONTHS HAVE COMPLETELY FREE ACCESS. LONG TERM IT'S DIFFICULT FOR US TO SUBSIDIZE THOSE SORTS OF PROGRAMS. I WANT TO TALK A LITTLE ABOUT PERFORMANCE BECAUSE I MENTIONED FIBER TO THE HOME THE IMPORTANCE OF THE PERFORMANCE OF FIBER. HAS REALLY BEEN SHOWN BY THIS PANDEMIC. AND WE SAW AT THE START OF SHELTER IN PLACE A THIRTY. A PERCENT INCREASE ALMOST OVERNIGHT IN THE CONSUMPTION OF INBOUND USAGE- AND BETWEEN FORTY AND 50% INCREASE IN OUTBOUND. AND SO YOU THINK ABOUT YOU KNOW SORT OF BASELINE PERFORMANCE OF A TWENTY FIVE DOWN THREE UP PRODUCT. AND A SINGLE ZOOM GROUP CALL REQUIRES BETWEEN ONE AND A HALF IN TWO AND A HALF MEGABITS. AND I HAVE THREE YOUNG CHILDREN MY WIFE AND I ARE ALSO LUCKY ENOUGH TO BE ABLE TO WORK FROM HOME GIVEN THE INDUSTRIES THAT WERE IN. AND THERE ARE TIMES WHEN ALL FIVE OF US- ON ZOOM TEAMS HANG OUT MEET AT CETERA AND- AND SO A LOT MORE UPSTREAM BANDWIDTH IS NEEDED. AS AN IMPORTANT RECOGNITION YOU KNOW AS THESE TECHNOLOGIES HAVE EVOLVED I THINK THE FUTURE OF WORK IN THE FUTURE OF LEARNING. YOU KNOW I'M TRYING TO TAKE THE MOST OPTIMISTIC VIEW ABOUT THE CHANGES THAT THIS PANDEMIC HAS BROUGHT. AND ONE OF THOSE IS THAT YOU KNOW WE MAY BE ABLE TO. WORK FROM HOME MORE AND HAVE MORE FLEXIBLE WORKING ENVIRONMENTS- AND WE MIDDLE SUPPORT STUDENTS WHO HAVE A VARIETY OF NEEDS. BY SUPPORTING THEM AT A DISTANCE SO I ONE TOLD ABOUT KIND OF THE TWO BROAD CATEGORIES THAT WE THINK ABOUT- IN REGARDS TO CONNECTING HOUSEHOLDS AND CONNECTING STUDENTS THE FIRST IS. I THINK THE ONE THAT GETS THE MOST ATTENTION THAT IS DEPLOYMENT. THE RURAL PROBLEM- THE SMALL PERCENTAGE OF HOUSEHOLDS IN CALIFORNIA WHO HAVE NO INTERNET ACCESS AVAILABLE OR FOR WHOM THE INTERNET ACCESS IS JUST. INSUFFICIENTLY SLOW AND SO THAT MIGHT BE A VERY OLD DSL SYSTEM. FOR NOTHING EVER. AND TESE AREAS YOU KNOW THESE ARE A CHALLENGE PRIMARILY OF SUBSIDY IT IS A FINANCIAL CHALLENGE HOW DO YOU CONVINCE CARES TO GO BUILD. A TO FAR FLUNG LOCATIONS WHERE IS THERE IS NO CLEAR RETURN ON INVESTMENT. AND I'VE SEEN REFORMS IN THE CASF PROGRAMMING CERTAINLY ENCOURAGE THE STATE TO CONTINUE TO COMMIT TO. A PROGRAMS LIKE CASF AND OTHER GRANT PROGRAMS. THAT WOULD REACH THOSE RURAL MARKETS. IN THOSE THERE CONTINUE TO BE PROBLEMS THOUGH BEARS AND DEPLOYMENT YOU KNOW ISSUES AROUND LOCAL PERMITTING- UTILITY STANDARDS LIKE DIRECTIONAL BORING IN MICRO TRENCHING ARE ESSENTIAL POLL SAFETY AND ONE TOUCH MAKE READY ACCESS TO UTILITY POLES ARE ESSENTIAL TABLE STAKES BEFORE YOU INVEST IN THOSE SORTS OF PROGRAMS. SONIC THOUGH IS FOCUSED ON THE URBAN AND SUBURBAN DEPLOYMENT TODAY WE- DO NOT- HAVE NOT BUILT ANY RURAL MARKETS AND WE HAVEN'T PURCHASED IT IN ANY OF THE SUBSIDY PROGRAMS WOULD REALLY STRUGGLE TO FIND A BUSINESS MODEL AROUND THOSE THAT WOULD ALLOW US AS A PRIVATE ENTITY. THE BILL NETWORK INTO THOSE FAR FLUNG IN VERY CHALLENGING ENVIRONMENTS I REALLY APPLAUD THE CARES THAT HAVE SUCCEEDED NOT. AS WE THINK ABOUT URBAN AND SUBURBAN ENVIRONMENTS. GENERALLY THERE IS SOME FORM ACCESS IT MIGHT BE A PRE EXISTING DSL OR A FIBRE TO THE NODE PRODUCTS OR IT MIGHT BE A HYBRID FIBRE COAXIAL CABLE SYSTEM OTHER MENU MEDIA A FIBER IN SOME LOCATIONS. IN THOSE LOCATIONS OF URBAN LOCATIONS WE ACTUALLY HAVE MORE UNCONNECTED HOUSEHOLDS AND MORE UNCONNECTED STUDENTS THAN WE DO IN THE RURAL MARKETS WHERE THEY HAVE NO CHOICE TO CONNECT. ADOPTION IS A CRITICAL ISSUE THAT IS A MORE COMPLEX PROBLEM DEPLOYMENT PROBLEM IS- YOU KNOW IT IS A CHALLENGING ONE IT'S AN EXPENSIVE ONE THAT'S WHY IT'S CHALLENGING. BUT THE ADOPTION ISSUE IS MORE COMPLEX IN OTHER WORDS WHEN THEY'RE TWO OR THREE CARRIERS OFFERING A SERVICE TO A HOME AND URBAN MARKET. WHY DO WE CAN TO HAVE ROUGHLY 20% OF HOMES IN URBAN MARKETS NOT CONNECTED. AND COST IS REALLY A KEY FACTOR THERE- SO THERE ARE TWO PRIMARY FACTORSCOST. AND EDUCATION ACCESS TO DEVICES ACOSTA- IT ENCOMPASSES DEVICES AND EQUIPMENT- THE AFFORDABILITY THE CONNECTION ITSELF WHERE EDUCATION HOW WHY DO I WANT THIS HOW WILL I USE IT. AND THE- YOU KNOW SUPPORTING THE PARENTS AND STUDENTS AS TO- THE KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THEM THE USE OF THE CONNECTIONS. AND AS A AS A COMPETITIVE CARRIER. WHAT WE OBSERVE IS THAT THE MORE COMPETITION YOU HAVE IN THE MARKETPLACE. THE HIGHER THE PERFORMANCE OF THE SERVICES. AND THE LOWER THE COST OF THOSE SERVICES AND CRITICALLY EASY THINK ABOUT AN ENVIRONMENT WITH DISTANCE LEARNING AND WORK FROM HOME. HAVING HIGHER THAN TWENTY FIVE DOWN AND THREE MEGABITS UP IS IMPORTANT. AND WHERE YOU HAVE SLOW LEGACY TECHNOLOGIES DEPLOYED YOU'D REALLY LIKE TO SEE FAST FIBRE DEPLOYED. AS A COMPETITIVE CARRIER FOCUSED ON URBAN AND SUBURBAN FIBER DEPLOYMENT WE EXPERIENCE MANY BEARS TO THAT APPOINTMENT OF PAUL SAFETY AND ONE TOUCH MAKE READY PROCESSES AROUND POLL REINFORCEMENT AND REPLACEMENT TO ALLOW FOR DEPLOYMENT ARE CHALLENGING AND TODAY RESULTING GAPS IN OUR DEPLOYMENT. LOCAL PERMITTING ALSO PRESENTS CHALLENGES AND- WE HAVE CITIES THAT WERE READ WITH TODAY. WHO DON'T WANT US TO SET TEMPORARY POLLS. DESPITE THE EXISTING COAL BEING OVERLOADED AND UNSAFE AND THE TEMPORARY POLL WOULDN'T RESOLVE THIS SAFETY ISSUE WHILE ALLOWING US TO DEPLOY. WHAT IT MEANS TO PAUL SITTING SIDE BY SIDE MAY FIND THAT UNSIGHTLY DESPITE IT BEING A TEMPORARY CONDITION UNTIL THE ELECTRIC UTILITY POLE HONOR RESOLVES THE EXISTING SAFETY ISSUE. THANK A THIRD TRAILER IS. STANDARDS AROUND MODERN CONSTRUCTION METHODOLOGIES IN UNDERGROUND CONSTRUCTION. AND TODAY THE TWO PRIMARY UNDERGROUND CONSTRUCTION METHODS USED ARE TRENCHLESS METHODS DIRECTIONAL BORING AND MICRO TRENCHING- BUT DESPITE THAT MANY CITIES HAVE NOT ADOPTED STANDARDS ALLOW FOR NARROW SLOT OR MICRO TRENCHING- TO BE PERFORMED. BUT THAT IS AN ESSENTIAL TECHNOLOGY FOR NEW DEPLOYMENT OF FIBER OPTIC INFRASTRUCTURE THANK YOU MISTER JACKSON IS GOING TO HAVE TO ASK YOU TO JUST REFERENCE YOUR ARM AS- THE OTHER ISSUE THAT WE THINK IS ACCESS TO MULTI TENANT ENVIRONMENTS. APARTMENT BUILDING OWNERS. DO NOT NECESSARILY WANT TO SEE THEIR TENANTS WELL CONNECTED AND THIS REALLY SURPRISED ME AND- I LIVE IN THE NORTH BAY. ACTION SENATOR MIKE MCGUIRE'S- REGION AND- SO YOU KNOW I GREW UP IN NORTH BAY AREA AND OUR FIRST MAJOR FIBER DEPLOYMENTS IN THE CITY OF SAN FRANCISCO. AND WE'RE STRUGGLING TO GET INTO A NUMBER OF- BUILDINGS IN WESTERN SAN FRANCISCO WE SPOKE WITH A BUILDING MANAGER ABOUT HOW GREAT THIS NEW FIBRE CONNECTION BEING HOW MUCH THEIR TENANTS WOULD ENJOY A GIGABIT RELIABLE FIBER SERVICE. IN THIS BUILDING MANAGER SAID THIS BUILDINGS RENT CONTROL THE SENATE LIKE THEIR INTERNET THEY CAN MOVE AND THAT'S BETTER FOR US. AND THAT'S THAT SORT OF ATTITUDE IS REALLY CORROSIVE SAM'S HAS TAKEN SOME STEPS TO COMPEL ST JASPER CAN WE DO THAT BILL HAVE YOU. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN HEAR ME OKAY A NUMBER OF BUILDINGS WHERE WE STRUGGLE WITH ACCESS. SO FROM A STATE ONE POLICY PERSPECTIVE POLICIES AROUND I DON'T THINK MODERNIZE TRENCHING METHODS. ACCESS TO APARTMENT BUILDINGS POLICIES LIKE THE- SORRY MR JASPER WE'VE DONE WELL OVER THE FIVE MINUTES I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE WE'RE BEING FAIR WITH EACH OF OUR PANELISTS SO- I KNOW WILL HAVE A LOT OF QUESTIONS RESPECTED TO WHAT YOU JUST MENTIONED WE JUST REALLY THANK YOU FOR YOUR INSIGHT THERE SO I'M GONNA GO HEAD TO OUR FINAL PANELIST AND THEN WE'LL OPEN IT UP FOR QUESTIONS I'M SURE YOU WILL HAVE SOME QUESTIONS- OUR FINAL WITNESS ON THIS PANEL IS JORI WOLF THE VICE PRESIDENT OF DIGITAL INNOVATIONS THAT MAGELLAN ADVISORS. THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER WILL FOR JOINING US. THANK YOU AND GOOD AFTERNOON- COMMITTEE CHAIRS GONZALEZ AND LEYVA- AND ALSO- SENATORS I WOULD. LIKE TO LET YOU KNOW- MAGELLAN ADVISORS WORKS WITH GOVERNMENTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ACTUALLY THROUGHOUT THE NATION- BUT WE FOCUS WORK- AND HELPING GOVERNMENTS OF. AND DESIGN AND BUILD OUR FIBER AND WIRELESS NETWORKS TO HELP WITH ELIMINATING THE DIGITAL DIVIDE. WORK OUR CLIENTS SEE VERY RATTLING. DODD IT'S EXPENSIVE FOR THE SERVICE PROVIDERS TO BUILD WITHIN- THE RURAL AREAS AND EVEN IN SOME METRO AREAS WHERE THE PARCELS ARE LARGE AND THE DENSITIES ARE NOT ON OUR SMALL. WE LOOK TO OPPORTUNITIES TO UTILIZE PUBLIC ASSETS WHENEVER POSSIBLE YEAH OUR FOCUS IS TO ASSIST GOVERNMENTS IN FILLING OF THIS GAP THE GAP BETWEEN THE CONSUMER AND THE SERVICE PROVIDER SERVICE PROVIDERS ARE PLEASE ARE ARE HAVE A PROFIT MOTIVE AND THAT'S REALLY WELL UNDERSTOOD- AND OF COURSE IT'S RESPECTED THEY HAVE SHAREHOLDERS THAT THEY NEED TO ACCOUNT TO. THE GOVERNMENTS ARE LOOKING AT BROADBAND IS A NEW UTILITY AND OF COURSE- IT WAS ALL AROUND IT I CANNOT MAKE DEVELOPMENT IN WHICH BROADBAND BECAME KEY AND ARE FOUND DEAD ELEMENT OF JUNIOR BUILDING. WE SIT WE SAW THIS STARTING IN THE NINETEEN NINETIES SOUND IT'S CONTINUING NOW INTO THE TWO THOUSANDS. BEING SECOND ELEMENT GOAL AN OBJECT. HAVE NOW BE SUPERSEDED BY CO. AND CHARLIE AND LEARNING HAS EMERGED AS THE PRIMARY THING. WE'RE SEEING THAT SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND GOVERNMENTS ARE NOW STARTING TO PAIR UP AND WORK TOGETHER ESPECIALLY BECAUSE GOVERNMENTS MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENTS AND COUNTY GOVERNMENTS DO HAVE ASSETS AND THEY CAN WORK WITH UTILITY PROVIDERS. WITH OTHER STATE AGENCIES- AND ALSO WHERE'S COMMITTEE ANCHOR INSTITUTIONS IN WHICH TO- BUILD FIBER OPTIC NETWORKS TO PROVIDE FOR THE GAPS THAT CURRENTLY EXIST FOURS ARE USED AND THE STUDENTS- THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS THEMSELVES ARE WELL SERVED BY STATE PROGRAMS- SCENIC IS DONE VERY WELL. ALONG THE LINES OF E. RATE FUNDING- BUT OF COURSE THAT IS CONNECTING SCHOOL FACILITIES BUT IS NOT CONNECTING WITH THE CONSUMER- WE SEE TIME AND TIME AGAIN. WHERE ARE USING THEIR BACKBONE AND ALSO ASSISTING- CITY. I'M SORRY WHAT SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO IN WHICH TO- IMPLEMENTED CARRIER SOLUTIONS WIRELESS SOLUTIONS FOR THE LAST MILE TO CONNECT TO USED TO THESE. ODD JOBS TO THE INTERNET- AND ALSO THE G. SERVICES- INCLUDING THEIR FAMILIES FOR TELEWORK. WE HAVE. GONE FROM CITIES. UP AND FUNDING MASTER PLANS FOR OF SHORTFALL CAN. AND NETWORK TO CITY'S PARTNER AND LOOKING FOR PRIVATE PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS WITH NEW ENTRANTS TO OPERATE THESE NETWORKS BASED UPON THE PUBLIC ASSETS IN THE INVESTMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE AND TRAFFIC SIGNAL CONTROL SYSTEMS- AND MANY OTHER SYSTEMS FOR UTILITY SCALE- APPLICATIONS. AND MANY MANY OTHERS THOSE ARE NOW- SPILLING OVER INTO YOUR FILLING THE NEEDS OF STUDENTS FOR DISTANCE LEARNING AFRICAN ACTING FAMILIES- WHERE THERE. ISN'T ENOUGH DOWN WEST. WITH THESE CAN WE'RE SEEING AT. IN KEY THROUGHOUT. IN THE NORTHERN PORTION OF THE COUNTY AND EVEN IN THE SOUTHERN PORTION OF THE COUNTY WHERE COUNTIES ARE BRINGING THEIR CITIES TOGETHER- AND WITH MANY COUNTIES COMING TOGETHER AND CONSOLIDATING INTO CONSORTIUMS IN WHICH TO APPLY FOR GRANT FUNDING FROM THE STRUTS- INDIAN USING OTHER STATE MONIES FOR BEING ABLE TO USE THOSE LOCAL MATCH. THE BIG CHALLENGE THAT OUR CLIENTS HAVE RIGHT NOW IS FINDING THE LOCAL MATCH THE LOCAL MATCHES THE MOST DIFFICULT. PART IN BEING ABLE TO FIND THE LAST MILE- BUT ALSO FUNDING MIDDLE MILE BACKBONE NETWORKS FOR REGIONAL COLLABORATION AMONG CITIES WITHIN COUNTIES AND COUNTIES. WITH ONE ANOTHER WHICH IN GEOGRAPHIC AREAS. WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE IMPLEMENTATION OF A DICK ONCE THROUGHOUT ALL OF THESE COMMUNITIES WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE PUBLIC WORKS ASSOCIATIONS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO ADOPT A ONCE. AND IS IT INSTEAD TO ADOPT STANDARDS FOR- DIRECTIONAL BORING- BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY FOR MICRO TRENCHING TECHNOLOGIES. IT'S REALLY KEY THAT WE LOOK AT THIS ALTERNATE SOLUTION NOT JUST FROM THE SERVICE PROVIDERS WHO CAN'T AFFORD TO BUILD WHERE IT'S TOO EXPENSIVE BUT TO ASSIST TO THE GOVERNMENTS TO BUILD. WHERE THEY FEEL THAT IT'S KEY FOR THE COMMUNITY BUILDING FOR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND FOR QUALITY OF LIFE. AND FOR RESPONSE TO KROGER. WE'D LIKE TO SEE- THE EXPANSION OF OPPORTUNITIES TO GO AFTER FEDERAL MONEY AGAIN THERE'S JUST NOT ENOUGH LOCAL MATCH IN WHICH TO DO THAT BUT IF THE STATE WERE ABLE TO ASSIST. OUR CLIENTS- AND CITIES AND COUNTIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE- IN ACQUIRING FEDERAL GRANTS USING STATE MONIES- OF THESE NETWORKS WILL END UP GENERATING REVENUE AND THOSE REVENUES. WILL ACTUALLY REPAY THE CAP EX INVESTMENTS- FOR THESE BROADBAND MUNICIPAL NETWORKS THAT BETTER SERVE THE COMMUNITIES ESPECIALLY IN RURAL AREAS AND WHERE IT'S TOO EXPENSIVE TO BUILD. WE ALSO SEE THAT OUT THERE ARE- OPPORTUNITIES FOR CITIES TO COME TOGETHER BECAUSE WORKING INDEPENDENTLY WORKS OR ON THEIR OWN- IS IT'S TOO EXPENSIVE- IT'S TOO DIFFICULT TO BE ABLE TO WRITE GRANT APPLICATIONS ONE AFTER THE NEXT AND- IF THEY COME TOGETHER IN A REGIONAL COURT A COOPERATIVE CONCERN. AT A COUNTY LEVEL WE SEE THAT THERE'S MUCH MORE OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF CITY TO CITY CAPITAL PROJECTS THAT CAN BE USED TO LOWER THE COST OF CONSTRUCTION TO BRING IN YOU JODY IS SUCH AS WATER YOU JUST NEED WATER DISTRICTS ELECTRIC COOPS AND OTHERS THAT CAN ASSIST. YOU PROVIDING ASSETS INCLUDING AERIAL DEPLOYMENT AS WELL AS C. R. P. PROJECTS CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PROJECTS UNDERGROUND THAT WILL HOUSE THE COST OF THE CONSTRUCTION OF FIBER NETWORKS WITHIN THESE COMMUNITIES. SO OVERALL SEE THAT THERE'S BEEN A LACK OF ATTENTION TO MUNICIPALITIES AND TWO COUNTIES AND GOVERNMENT'S TRYING TO ACHIEVE SOMETHING THAT IS NOT BEING DONE BY THE PRIVATE SECTOR- BUT THEY OBVIOUSLY UNDERSTAND NEEDS TO BE DONE. AND WE NEED WAS SYSTEM GOING FORWARD THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- VICE PRESIDENT WILL FULLY APPRECIATE THAT INSIGHT AS WELL- WE THINK EACH OF THE PANELISTS FOR BEING HERE AND ALL OF YOUR INSIGHT AS MENTIONED- WE WILL NOW TAKE IT BACK TO MEMBERS QUESTIONS OF THE VERY FIRST NUMBER I HAVE IS A SENATOR MCGUIRE. THANK YOU SO MUCH OF NINE CHAIRMAN SHOOTER I'M BITES COMMENTS IT'S ALRIGHT WITH YOU INSURE LATELINE FIRST AND FOREMOST I WANT TO SAY THANKS FOR ABOUT EXCELLENT PANEL HERE TO GAIN BEGINS. YOUR PERSONAL REPRESENTED AT THE CHALLENGES THAT CALIFORNIA FACES IN. JERRY I WANT TO SEE IF YOU CAN YOU AND YOUR LEYVA PEER LEADERS ON THESE. ISSUES ESPECIALLY REGION IN GENERAL THE DIGITAL DIVIDE IN A BIG SHOUT OUT TO SUPERINTENDENT TONY THURMOND OF COURSE. THE MINISTRATION OGBU TONY THURMOND HAS BEEN A PERSON HAD BEEN. WALKING HIS TALK ON ALL ISSUES TO BRIDGE THE DIGITAL DIVIDE ONCE THAT FIVE POINT THREE BILLION AS ALLOCATED A GETTING THAT MONEY INTO THE HANDS OF DISTRICTS. I AND I ALSO WANT TO SEE THANK YOU TO RISE TO PRETEND BERMAN FOR INSURING. THE DOCKET RESPONSE IN STAFFERS HAD OF TRYING TO BE ABLE TO BRING DOWN THOSE WAITING LISTS THERE ARE BARELY AT TENS OF THOUSANDS OF DEVICES THAT WERE WAITING FOR WEATHER CHAPLAINS. ARE IN OR OUT LAPTOPS ARE HOT SPOTS IN THE SUPERINTENDENT IN HIS TEAM HAS BEEN ALL OVER. BRINGING DOWN THOSE WAITING THIS AS ONE STATE THANK YOU. I JUST A FEW COMMENTS. ON WORLD. AND WORLD CUP FOR HAS HAD A DIGITAL THE BY. SINCE BEARS AROUND. I'M DESPITE ALL DIGITAL THE- NAY BE NEW FOR SOME AREAS THE STATE BUT- WE TAKE A LOOK. AT WHAT IS HIGH. I HIGHLIGHTS THE DISK. THAT WE'VE HAD CAL. FOR YOU WHEN IT COMES TO CONNECT TO THE ONCE UP. NEEDIEST KIDS. IF WE LOOK AT RURAL CALIFORNIA PER CAPITA. REAL CALIFORNIA HAS THE HIGHEST RATES OF HOMELESSNESS AND STATE FACTS. HUMBOLDT COUNTY HAS. THE HIGHEST. HOMELESS RATE PER CAPITA IN THE STATE AND THE THIRD HIGHEST IN AMERICA MENDOCINO COUNTY HAS THE SEVENTH. HIGHEST ALMOST RATE. IN AMERICA AND IT'S A COMMUNITY OF SIXTY SEVEN THOUSAND VOTES. DATE THESE RURAL COUNTIES HAVE THE HIGHEST RATES OF ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES BOTH PHYSICAL AND SEXUAL ABUSE OUR HIGHEST RATES OF KIDS IN POVERTY PER CAPITA. IN WE KNOW THAT WHEN CONNECT. HAPPENS IN OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES OUR ECONOMY PROSPERS AND I THINK THAT'S BEEN A FRUSTRATION. THAT WE'VE HAD FOR DECADES IN RURAL CALIFORNIA. ALL RIGHT SO I JUST WANT TO TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE POLITICS OF IT. BECAUSE WE CAN TALK TO WEAR BLUE IN THE FACE THAT WE NEED AN ACTIVITY LET'S JUST BE REALLY OPEN AND BLUNT. IT'S THE POLITICS THAT EXIST IN THE LEGISLATURE ON WHY WE'RE NOT SEEING CONNECTED IN OUR COMMUNITIES WE CAL TALE- ALMOST EVERY YEAR. CHU I'M SPECIAL INTERESTS LIKE TELECOM AND CABLE SO THAT WE DON'T PROVIDE. EASIER ACCESS TO OPERATE MUNICIPAL OPTIONS ARE HAPPENING MUNICIPAL. MUNICIPALITIES BE ABLE TO WORK WITH REGIONAL CARRIERS LIKE SONIC TO BE ABLE TO IMPLEMENT. THEIR OWN SOLUTIONS BETTER BRIDGE THE DIGITAL DIVIDE THIS HAS EVERYTHING TO DO WITH POLITICS AND NOT SOUND POLICY IN THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE I WHY WE CONTINUE TO SEE THIS DIGITAL BY. INCREDIBLY. FRUSTRATING I WILL SAY THE AT. WHEN THERE ARE NO WINNERS BEEN MUNICIPAL UNVEILED. IN YOUR INCITING OF THE PUBLIC UTILITIES FOR MONEY OUT WE IT'S NOT COME OUT T. A BOY. AND TO BE OUT OF SIGHT NEEDS. MUNIS OPTION IN THESE GRANTS TO BE TO SLOW. TO CAN FOR A LOCAL GUY OR SMALL REGIONAL CARRIER MEDIUM RANGE CARRIER GET PROVIDE. FIBER BECAUSE WHEN IT'S THE SUPER SLOPE. THERE ARE AREAS WHERE COM AND AT&amp;T AND VERIZON ONE NEVER GOT NAY WILL NEVER GO BUT WHAT I'VE SEEN IN MY NECK OF THE WOODS IS THAT NAY WILL SITE THEY WILL FIGHT TOOTH AND NAIL TO BE ABLE TO STOP. AT SMALL PROJECTS ARE MEDIUM SIZED PROJECTS ARE BEING DUMPED OUT. AND I AGREE WITH THE CHAIR OR THE CHAIR AND STAND UNITED NOT SOME OF THE NEWS THE COMMISSIONER REPUBLICAN CHILES COMMISSION ON THE. STATUS AND JUST WANT TO THANK YOU FOR HER WORK. I WERE WE ARE HAVE CHALLENGE. IS WHERE FIBER EXISTS MOST LARGE COMPANIES WON'T ALLOW ACCESS EVEN YES THERE ARE COUNTIES IN THE STATE IS WILLING TO PAY AND THAT'S THE BOTTOM LINE TO THE LEASE ON THE NORTH COAST WHERE LIFE'S FIBER EXIST IT'S DARK IN THE COMMUNITIES IN WHICH THIS FIBER GOES THROUGH OUT YET THEY WON'T FIGHT IN NOT ALLOW WORKING ACTIVITY. IN THOSE COMMUNITIES I SAY ALL THAT IS I AGREE WITH MS MCINTYRE NEWS MCINTYRE'S ALWAYS PUT HERSELF AT THE TABLE AND I DO WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO THIS BACKING TRACK REPRESENTS PEOPLE OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO HAVE COLLABORATIVE CONVERSATIONS AND I AGREE WITH THAT. I GREE WITH MR ASK FOR THAT WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO EASE PERMITTING WE DO NEED TO EASE PERMITTING ACROSS THE STATE OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO. CONNECT OUR COMMUNITIES BUT IN RETURN I DO BELIEVE THAT WE NEED TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR RURAL COMMUNITIES OR URBAN COMMUNITIES ESPECIALLY URBAN COMMUNITIES OF COLOR BE ABLE TO LAUNCH THEIR OWN PROGRAM THEIR OWN PROGRAM THEY LOOK LIKE A WIDE FIRE BROADBAND DISTRICTS VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT WE HAVE WITH SEWER AND WATER ELECTRIC- AND- ALLOW THOSE COMMUNITIES WE ARE WORK WITH THE REGIONAL CARRIER LIKE A SONIC. I TO BE ABLE TO LAUNCH THE- BROADBAND OR WIFI WITHIN WAR INCORPORATED COMMUNITY- TO BE ABLE TO CONNECT YOUR KIDS AND BE A CONNECTOR FAMILIES. LASTING ALL SAVES THIS. THERE ARE AREA ON THE NORTH COAST. THAT HOT SPOT WILL WORK THERE IS NO SO. TOWERS IN THE ALL WAY BE ABLE TO GET CAN. WITH CONNECTED INTERNAL IS SATELLITE. AND SATELLITE IS INCREDIBLY. WE'RE CURRENTLY WORKING WITH THE GOVERNMENT EDUCATION TO BE ABLE TO NEGOTIATE A RATE VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT COMCAST IS DONE AND I WANT TO SAY. WE NEED TO POINT OUT WHEN THEY DO GOOD AND COMCAST IS DONE GOOD WITH OUR COMCAST ESSENTIAL PROGRAM PROVIDING. LOW INCOME FAMILIES AND KIDS ACCESS. TO THE INTERNET IN EXPLAINING THAT PROGRAM BY THE WAY I JUST WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO THEM. THROUGHOUT THIS PANDEMIC. BUT WE ALSO ARE FOCUSED ON A NON REGULATED UTILITY THAT WE HAVE. BECAUSE IT'S REGULATED AT THE SEC AND ADDS SATELLITE IN MAKING SURE THAT FOR THOSE KIDS WHO HAVE NO OTHER ALTERNATIVE BUT TO GET RETURNED A SATELLITE. THAT WE ARE GOING TO BAT IN THIS WHILE YOU CAN DOLLARS IN FEDERALLY REGULATED UTILITIES. I DON I DID TOO LONG AND I'M SORRY A LITTLE BIT OF A SOAPBOX I'M HAPPY TO HEAR FROM ANY OF OUR PANELISTS MANAGER BUT- I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT THERE IS- AN INCREDIBLE. FRUSTRATION IN FACT DOWNRIGHT ANGER AT TIMES. THAT WE KEEP TALKING ABOUT THIS WE KNOW WHAT THE SOLUTIONS ARE BUT LIKE. THIS ONE INSTEAD- WE LET THE POLITICS GET IN THE WAY OF THE GOOD. AND I THINK YOU SO MUCH ADVENTURE THANK YOU SENATOR MCGUIRE- I TO. ALSO FEEL A LOT OF YOUR FRUSTRATION AND WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT SOLUTIONS AND THAT'S CERTAINLY WHY WE'RE HERE- BUT WILL OPEN THAT UP TO THE PANELISTS OF ANYONE WOULD LIKE. TO RESPOND TO THAT WE WOULD LOVE TO. HERE YOU. WELL MADAM CHAIR NO ONE ELSE WISHES TO SPEAK ON IT I'M HAPPY TO STATE HERE THAT WOULD RESHAPE IT SENATORS CANDOR- THAT THIS IS BEEN A MATTER OF BOTH POLITICS AND ABOUT A LACK OF INVESTMENT IN CALIFORNIA COMMUNITIES IT IS HEART BREAKING THAT THERE ARE COMPANIES THAT SIMPLY WILL NOT INVEST IN RULE COMMUNITIES BECAUSE THEY DON'T THINK THAT THE POPULATION IS BROAD ENOUGH FOR THEM TO IT WOULD BE PROFITABLE AND SO THAT MEANS WE'VE ALLOWED CALIFORNIANS TO GO ABOUT SOMETHING THEY NEED NOT JUST FOR THE PANDEMIC WE WANT OUR STUDENTS TO BE READY FOR THE JOBS OF TOMORROW WE WANT THEM TO BE THE COMPUTER SCIENTISTS AND ENGINEERS. AND THAT BE HEALTH EXPERTS AND HAVE ACCESS TO HIGH SPEED INTERNET CHAT NOT JUST AT HOME BUT AT SCHOOL- LOWER OUT OF THE PANDEMIC IN THERE IN IN PERSON INSTRUCTION AND SO WE'RE COMMITTED TO WHAT THE SENATORS TALK ABOUT LOOKING INTO ALL KINDS OF OPTIONS INCLUDING INCLUDING SATELLITE WE THINK THAT THERE ARE SOME POTENTIAL OPPORTUNITIES THERE IT IS VERY VERY EXPENSIVE- BUT WE THINK THAT THERE ARE SOME OPPORTUNITIES AND AGAIN WE WANT TO PURSUE THEM FULL SPEED AHEAD AND HAPPY TO WORK WITH- CENTER AND WITH YOURSELF MADAM CHAIR AND- SENATOR. LEYVA OUR TECHNOLOGY PARTNERS IN. THE ENTIRE LEGISLATURE AS WE MOVE FOR. I'M THIS IS YOUR WHAT CAN. I BUT I BELIEVE THAT THAT.THERE ARE MANY. AND TO. USE EXISTING PUBLIC INVESTMENTS ESPECIALLY IN. SUBURBAN AND RURAL AREAS- WE SEE RAIL ALIGNMENT SPECIES MARC CORRIDORS WE SEE- OLD ABANDONED TELECOM ASSETS. WE SEE AGAIN ABANDONED. GAS PIPELINES SO LARGE AND EXTENSIVE WATER. NETWORKS AND VARIOUS OTHER. UTILITIES THAT WOULD ENABLE GOVERNMENTS TO SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE THE COST OF CONSTRUCTION. AND IN THE IN THE COURSE OF DOING THAT TO ENABLE. FACILITATE PRIVATE INVESTMENT TO DO THE LAST MILE CONNECTIVITY WITHIN THESE RURAL AREAS TO FILL. IN THE FOR BROADBAND. WHERE WE DON'T HAVE A TODAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER WILSON THANK YOU MISTER SUPERINTENDENT FOR THOSE ANSWERS AND SENATOR MCGUIRE FOR YOUR QUESTION WILL MOVE ON TO SENATOR TO BOOT ASAL AND THEN TO CENTER LEYVA. THANK YOU- IN SCHOOL IT'S WONDERFUL TO CA MIGHT MY COLLEAGUES HERE AND I'M GLAD I CAME UP. AFTER SENATOR MCGUIRE- BECAUSE OF WHAT HE SAID WHICH IS REALLY POWERFUL AND CLEAR. THANK YOU SIR LEYVA THANK YOU CENTER. BUT IF WE DON'T HAVE THAT OF COME. THEN FORGET IT WE'RE NOT WE'RE NOT DOING OUR KIDS ANY JUSTICE WE'RE NOT WE'RE NOT DEFENDING THEM WE'RE NOT PROTECTING THEM AND I JUST WANNA SAY FROM FROM MY DISTRICT IS MORE OF A QUICK COMMENT. THEN IT IS A QUESTION BUT- MY DISTRICT ALL THE ALL THE KIDS- I REPRESENT ARE IN THE SECOND LARGEST SCHOOL DISTRICT IN THE COUNTRY IS SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND STUDENTS 80% ARE LOW INCOME. THE NEW- L. A. U. S. T. REPORT SAYS 60% OF THE STUDENTS LOG ON TO THE DISTRICTS VIRTUAL CLASSROOM SOFTWARE ON A DAILY BASIS- ONE IN FOUR FAMILIES IN L. A. COUNTY WAS SCHOOL AGE CHILDREN HAVE THE TECHNOLOGY RESOURCES. THAT MEANS TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND COUNTY HOUSEHOLDS WITHOUT THE RESOURCES. SO AND MOST OF THOSE BEING IN IN MY DISTRICT AND WHAT ABOUT THE PARENTS WHO DON'T HAVE THE- THE ABILITY TO DO THIS BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT HOME OR- THAT CHILD CARE PROVIDERS DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO THIS. I THINK IT'S pWEALTHIEST CALIFORNIA IS POINTING TO THESE ISSUES THOSE KIDS WILL NEVER HAVE THE CHANCE TO BE A TO FILL THE CAREERS AND THE WORK FORCE NEEDS THAT THE STATE HAS- AS LONG AS WE CONTINUE TO DEFEND- WHATEVER PRACTICES LEAD. TO WHAT'S GOING ON RIGHT NOW- SO- EVERYONE S. SENATE MCGUIRE I WANT TO BE A PARTNER WITH YOU TO TAKE THIS OUT PUBLICLY WHAT CENTER THEN SALAS AND CENTER LEYVA AND ANYBODY ELSE. I THINK IT'S JUST OUTRAGEOUS I. ONE COMMENT THAT WAS MADE EARLIER. THAT I AGREED IS NOT A AGING. PROBLEM THIS A TECHNOLOGY THAT WE'VE GOT A FIX AND- I SURE HOPE THAT THE P. YOU SEE IN THOSE OF US IN THE LEGISLATURE COME UP WITH THE- WITH THE RIGHT ANSWER BECAUSE- IT SHOULDN'T BE UP TO OUR SUPERINTENDENTS TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO THIS THAT'S NOT THEIR JOB THEIR JOB IS TO TEACH- AND IT'S NOT TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO MAKE SURE THERE'S KIND OF CONNECTIVITY OR DEVICES SO. THANK YOU ALL I JUST WANT TO MAKE THAT COMMENT AND I APPRECIATE ALL THE WORK THAT THE PANELS PUT IN THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU SENATOR DROUGHT SO WE APPRECIATE THAT THANK YOU FOR JOINING US SENATOR LEYVA THANK YOU SENATOR GONZALEZ ON I JUST WANNA SAY AMEN TO WHAT SENATOR ALSO SAID AN AMEN TO WHAT SENATOR- ACQUIRE OR SAID. THAT THE IT'S REALLY INCREDIBLE THAT IN TWO THOUSAND TWENTY WE ARE STILL TRYING TO FIGURE OUT THE DIGITAL DIVIDE AND IT ISN'T JUST FOR SCHOOL CHILDREN HOW DO PEOPLE DO THEIR WORK FROM HOME I HAVE A QUESTION FOR OUR CAROL MCINTYRE. MS MCINTYRE CAN EXPLAIN HOW THE CAPE THE WELVE BRIDGE TO BROADBAND. INITIATIVE WORKS. IN REGARDS TO THE VERIFICATION OF A STUDENT OR FAMILIES ELIGIBILITY. IS IT COMPLETELY UP TO THE SCHOOL TO DETERMINE WHO IS ELIGIBLE SUCH AS STUDENTS WHO ARE ELIGIBLE FOR FREE OR REDUCED PRICE MEALS TO SERVICE PROVIDERS CONTACT FAMILIES TO DETERMINE ELIGIBILITY AND IF SO WHAT INFORMATION IS SOUGHT CREDIT HISTORY CURRENT INCOME. IF YOU COULD ENLIGHTEN US A LITTLE BIT THAT BE REALLY HELPFUL. M. SENATOR LEYVA I THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION- I HAD A LITTLE BIT BACK FEET BUT I BELIEVE I. AM UNDERSTOOD WHAT YOU'RE ASKING WHICH IS HOW THE FAMILIES ARE IDENTIFIED AND HOW THEIR QUALIFYING- I'M FORTY BE LOW INCOME PROGRAM OFFERINGS YEAH. THE CTA MEMBER COMPANIES THEY WORK WITH THE ATTEMPT TO WORK WITH THE SCHOOLS AND- IN MANY CASES WITH COMMUNITY PARTNERS. TO IDENTIFY POPULATIONS THAT MAY ACTUALLY QUALIFY FOR THE PROGRAM. AND THEN ONCE THOSE POPULATIONS ARE A QUALIFYING AND THEN THE FAMILY NEED APPLY AND VARIOUS FORMS OF IDENTIFICATION FOR THEM TO CONFIRM WHO AND THE AT THE CUSTOMER ACTUALLY IS. ARE ACCEPTABLE AND MANY CASES NO CREDIT REPORT IS REQUIRED I THEY SIMPLY NEED TO ENSURE THAT THE NEEDS BE CRITERIA FOR THE PROGRAM. WHICH IS ELIGIBILITY FOR THE FREE OR REDUCED LUNCH PROGRAM OR AND NOW THEIR SOCIAL SERVICE PROGRAMS DEPENDING ON THE COMPANY I'M AND THEN AND GET PROPERLY IDENTIFIED SO THAT THE COMPANY MAY PROVIDE. THEM WITH SERVICE. THE YOU SO WHEN POPER AT. THAT THE THEIR VARIOUS. THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO THE CUSTOMER DEPENDING ON WHAT THEY WANT TO OPERATE THEY CAN SIMPLY OFFER A DRIVER'S LICENSE OR- AN AUTHOR ACCENTUAL SECURITY I THINK IF IN FACT THAT'S WHAT THEY CHOOSE TO VARIOUS COMPANIES. I WILL NARROW IT IS SIMPLY TO CONFIRM THE IDENTIFICATION OF THE POTENTIAL CUSTOMER IN THEN THE INFORMATION IT'S NOT RETAIN THEIR AFTER THANK YOU I KNOW THAT THIS IS SECURITY NUMBERS WAS AN ISSUE THAT WE HAD WHEN WE FIRST STARTED THE DIGITAL DIVIDE TASK FORCE AND WE'D ASK PROVIDERS TO NOT ASK FOR THAT SO IT SOUNDS LIKE WHAT I'M HEARING YOU SAY IS THAT. YOUR PROVIDERS DO NOT ASK FOR IT BUT IT'S AN OPTION THAT THEY CAN PROVIDE IT THE OPTION IS UP TO THE CONSUMER BUT FORM AND IDENTIFICATION THEY LIKE TO PROVIDE AND THEN FOR CREDIT HISTORY YOU SAID IN MANY CASES IT IS NOT NEEDED. WHY WOULD IT BE EVER NEEDED. WELL FIRST SEVEN NEW CUSTOMERS THE COMPANY'S WERE IN FACT RAINY I CREDIT REPORTS. THAT PRACTICE IS NO LONGER IN PLACE INSIDE CULVERT- HAS BEEN- AND HAS BECOME A PROBLEM. THANK YOU- ONE OTHER QUESTION I KNOW WHEN THE COMMISSIONER TALKED ABOUT- THE LEGISLATURE AND GOVERNMENT REGULATING. INTERNET SERVICE YOU SAID THAT YOU DID NOT AGREE WITH THAT I'M JUST CURIOUS WHY. AS THE COMPANIES ARE COMPETITIVE INDUSTRY COMPANIES THAT HAVE ME PRIVATE INVESTMENTS INTO THE NETWORKS TO BUILD AND DEPLOY BROADBAND IN MOST OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WITHOUT ANY RATE OF RETURN WHICH IS GENERALLY THE MODEL THAT IS APPLIED TO RATE REGULATED COMPANIES AS WELL- THE ELECTRIC AND GAS UTILITIES THAT CURRENTLY OPERATE THE STATE. PLUS AND THE ENVIRONMENT IS MUCH MORE COMPETITIVE WHERE YOU GENERALLY HAVE AT LEAST TWO PROVIDERS USUALLY MORE I PROVIDING ASK SERVICE IN THE END OF THE YEAR IN ATHERTON COMMUNITY. WE KNOW THAT WE HAVE A PROBLEM WITH INTERNET CONNECTIVITY AND WE KNOW WE HAVE A PROBLEM WITH SERVICE IN MOST OF THE STATE AND WITH THE COMPETITIVE NATURE OF THE CABLE INDUSTRY AN INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER PROVIDERS- FRANKLY IT HASN'T GOTTEN DONE. SO HAVING GOVERNMENT STEP IN HAVING THE LEGISLATURE STEP IN. ISN'T THAT A WAY FOR US TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYONE HAS ACCESS. LET ME BE CLEAR WE SUPPORT THE STATE'S EFFORTS TO DEPLOY BROADBAND GOAL IS. OUR WHAT WE DON'T SUPPORT IS GOVERNMENT SUBSIDIZED COMPETITION WE BELIEVE THAT IT IS APPROPRIATE TO SET A STANDARD FOR THE MINIMUM SPEEDS AND THE TYPES OF SERVICES THAT BE- CONSUMERS IT SHOULD HANDLE. IT TO THE EXTENT THAT THAT SERVICE IS NOT AVAILABLE IN THERE'S NO PRIVATE INVESTMENT TO ALTERNATELY BRING THIS THE SERVICE ACT TO THAT LEVEL. AND THEN WE SUPPORT THE USE OF GOVERNMENT SUBSIDIES TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT BROADBAND IS AVAILABLE. AS THE AND TWO WITNESSES POINTED OUT EARLIER IN THE GALLEY IN THE END SUNDAY. REPRESENTATIVES THERE ARE SOME CASES WHERE IT'S JUST NOT ECONOMIC FOR A COMPETITIVE COMPANY TO BE WILLING TO GO AND MAKE A PRIVATE INVESTMENT SO WE ARE FULLY SUPPORTIVE. AND GOVERNMENT SUBSIDIES BE AT THE SURCHARGE SPENDING THAT HAS BEEN AVAILABLE WERE AFTER FINDING AND BECOMING AVAILABLE TO SUPPORT IN THE AREAS. GREAT THANK YOU THOSE ANSWERS WERE VERY HELPFUL THANK YOU MA'AM CHEROKEE CENTER LEAVE AND I THINK COMMISSIONER SERVICE HAS HER HAND UP AS WELL TO ADD. TO THIS CONVERSATION COMMISSIONER. IT THANK YOU CHAIR AND CHERYL LEYVA. I JUST WANNA COUNTER THE STOCK POINTED FACTS AND- WHICH IS THAT WE DO NOT HAVE COMPETITION WE CERTAINLY DON'T HAVE COMPETITION WITH CABLE PROVIDERS. VIRTUALLY EVERY TERRITORY IS ONLY SERVED BY ONE. CABLE COMPANY THERE ARE SOME LIMITED AREAS WHERE THERE IS ACTUAL COMPETITION WITHIN CABLE AND THAT'S- WHAT YOU THINK IT IS THE RICHER AREAS IN AS EVERY STUDY I MENTIONED ALREADY FOUND IT'S THE RICHER WHITER AREAS SO THE COMPETITION THE MARKET IS NOBODY IS COMPETING FOR POOR PEOPLE OF COLOR THAT'S THE PROBLEM IF WE'RE GONNA ALLOW THESE CABLE COMPANIES TO PROFIT FORTY AND 50% R. O. Y. ON THESE RICHER WHITER COMMUNITIES. THEN THEY SHOULD HAVE THE OBLIGATION TO SERVE THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY THIS IS WHERE THE OBLIGATION COMES IN THERE'S NO COMPETITION IN ALL OF THESE. AND BY THE WAY I WANT TO ADD I AGREE WITH SOMETHING THAT DANG SAID EARLIER FROM SONIC. THE PROBLEM WAS ADOPTION AND URBAN AREAS HE IS OUR BIGGEST PROBLEM IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IT'S WHERE MILLIONS OF OUR CHILDREN ARE BEING LEFT ALONE IT'S IN LA IT'S IN THE BIG CITIES IN OAKLAND IT'S AN FRESNO IT'S AN BAKER STILL IT'S IN SACRAMENTO IT'S IN THE CITIES. AND THESE CABLE COMPANIES HAVE THE BENEFIT OF SERVING THE WEALTHY WITH NO OBLIGATION TO SERVE THE POOR THE OTHER FRONTIER EIGHTEEN ANTI SAME THING THEY THEY DON'T HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO SERVE. THEY DON'T EVEN HAVE A GOOD YOU KNOW HIGH FIBER EVERYWHERE SO ANYWAY. I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT. THIS IS NOT GONNA TO THE MARKET HAVE WE WILL A LONG TIME AND IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT FINDING THE ALTERNATIVE THAT'S GONNA TAKE A LONG TIME WE- THESE COMPANIES. SHOULD HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO SERVE THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY. IT'S THE WE HAVE NO REPORTING ON HOW THERE'S NO TRANSPARENCY ON THESE LOW INCOME PLANS THAT THEY'RE OFFERING. YES IT'S GREAT THAT THEY'RE DOING THAT BUT THEY'RE NOT REQUIRED TO DO IT ALL THE ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS ARE ALL OVER THE PLACE WE DON'T KNOW HOW ONE PERSON'S IMPLEMENTING IT OVER ANOTHER. THERE'S NO UNIFORMITY THERE'S NO REQUIREMENT THERE'S NO REPORTING WE ACTUALLY DON'T KNOW HOW MANY CALIFORNIANS ARE SIGNED UP FOR THESE PROGRAMS TO EVEN GIVE THEMCREDIT. THAT THIS IS HAPPENING THEY SHOULD BE PUBLICLY REPORTED SO WE KNOW WHERE THE POCKETS OF THEY'RE STILL MISSING OUT AND CONTINUE TO WORK ON PROGRESS THAT ARE. IMMEDIATE LOW HANGING FRUITS. THANK YOU THANK YOU COMMISSIONER AND I HAVE TO ADD ON TO THAT I KNOW THAT THE IDEA OF OPEN ACCESS OR OF WHICH IS A- SYSTEM WHERE THE SAME PHYSICAL NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE IS USED AND SHARED BY MULTIPLE INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS- IT'S BEEN BROUGHT UP IN. IN PAST DISCUSSIONS- THESE COULD BE COMMUNITY BASED OPEN ACCESS NETWORKS COULD THAT COULD BE NEUTRAL OPEN MARKET PLATFORMS WERE SERVICE PROVIDERS ALL HAVE EQUAL ACCESS TO THE INFRASTRUCTURE SO I JUST WANTED TO ASK ABOUT THAT AND PERHAPS- EITHER- MISTER JASPER MISTER WOLF CAN ALSO. DISCUSS THIS BECAUSE THEY WOULD BE. AN OPEN ACCESS NETWORK WOULD WOULD KIND OF BE OPEN TO ALL- PROVIDERS LARGE AND SMALL LOCAL GOVERNMENTS SO IF WE CAN TOUCH ON THAT AND WHY THAT WOULD BE SO IMPORTANT. SB AS A PERTAINS TO COMPETITION. I CAN START THANK YOU- MADAM CHAIR I THINK IT'S KEY THAT GOVERNMENT'S ASSISTANCE TO THE PRIVATE SECTOR AND YOU COMING INTO AREAS WHERE THERE'S BEEN A LACK OF INVESTMENT BECAUSE OF THESE OBSTACLES- EITHER THE LACK OF DENSITY OR THE- THE ISSUES OF- OF COMPETITIVE CONTESTS ADAM AND THE MARKET- WE HAVE SEEN THAT IN THE COUNTY OF VENTURA AND THAT NOW IN THE COUNTIES OF SONOMA NAPA. MARIN MENDOCINO- THAT ZZ WHEN THESE COUNTIES THE CITIES COME TOGETHER- AND IN THE SOUTH BAY IN CALIFORNIA THIRTEEN CITIES CAME TOGETHER THEY WERE ABLE TO REMOVE THESE OBSTACLES BY PROVIDING AN OPEN ACCESS MIDDLE MILE NETWORK THAT ENABLED NEW ENTRANTS TO COME IN AND INVEST IN JAIL AND THE LAST MILE. AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT'S HAPPENING- WHAT'S KEY AND ALL THIS IS THERE NEED TO BE DROPPED STONES THERE NEEDS TO BE. VISIBILITIES ABOUT. AND IT'S SIX. TO BUILD ALL THAT- SO EXCITES BUILDING THE MIDDLE MILE BACKBONE THE CITIES AND THESE COUNTIES ARE PROVIDING THEIR CIP PROJECTS WHICH WERE WERE WERE LOWERED THE COST OF THE CONSTRUCTION. BUT AT THE SAME TIME THEY'RE PROVIDING KEY PHYSICAL FACILITIES AND ASSETS IN WHICH TO- PROVIDE FOR MEET ME ROOMS- DROP ROOMS- INTERCONNECTION POINTS FOR PROVIDERS TO DO BUSINESS WITH OTHER RESEARCH. AND OTHER PROVIDERS- AND THAT'S REALLY CHEESY. POSTURING THE BUILD OF FIBER AND NETWORK WHERE THERE ISN'T THERE ISN'T ONE TODAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT MISTER WOLF A PRE SHEE YOUR YOUR COMMENTS THERE- AND THEN A MISSED SENATOR PENN HAS A QUESTION I'LL GO TO HIM. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND APPRECIATE THE DISCUSSION- FIRST OF ALL IT PARDON MY IGNORANCE WHAT IS WHEN WE TALK ABOUT LOW INCOME AREAS AND WE I HEARD SOMETHING ABOUT. WHAT WE ONLY WANT TO SUBSIDIZE THE MINIMUM. SO WE DON'T SUBSIDIZE COMPETITION WHAT WHAT IS THAT STANDARD. OF INTERNET ARE BROADBAND THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THAT. WE'RE EXPECTING LOW INCOME AREAS TO HAVE. I FELT OUT OF MISS MCINTYRE WANT TO ADDRESS THAT BECAUSE THEY THINK YOU MADE REFERENCE TO THAT WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT SPEED ARE WE TALKING ABOUT THAT IT'S OKAY TO SUBSIDIZE BUT NOT. ABOVE SENATE PANELS CAROLYN MCINTYRE WITH CGA. WE SUPPORT THE FCC'S STANDARD OF TWENTY FIVE AND THREE. I TWENTY FIVE MEGABITS PER SECOND DOWN AND THREE ASK OKAY. SO I THANK YOU SO I GUESS MY NEXT QUESTIONS ACTUALLY TO OUR SUPERINTENDENT. PUBLIC CONSTRUCTION TONY THURMOND AND A I WANNA THANK SO MUCH FOR LEADERS. LEAVE ME A LA OF QUESTIONS ASK IN REGARD TO SCHOOL OPEN. AND STAYING OPEN THAT'S NOT THE SUBJECT OF THIS HEARING BUT WHAT DID WANT TO ASK YOU IS THAT. IS SUPERINTEND PUBLIC CONSTRUCTION. HAS OF THE PART OF EDUCATION LOOKED AT. WHAT'S OF INTERNET DOES A TYPICAL FAMILY NEED IN ORDER FOR THEIR KIDS TO PEOPLE TO ENGAGE IN THE DISTANCE LEARNING WE JUST TALKED ABOUT THE FIRST HALF OF THE HEARING. YOU KNOW IF YOU HAVE TWO KIDS. THREE KIDS EIGHTY MORE BUT EVEN WITH JUST TWO OR THREE. WHAT KIND OF SPEED INTERNET THE PEOPLE NEED TO HAVE IN ORDER FOR THEM TO HAVE RELIABLE CONNECTION. PETER PAN- THERE'S BEEN MUCH DEBATE ON THE SUBJECT. PUT IT. IN A VERY FRANK WAGER THANK AT SOME COMPANIES ARE NOT. PROVIDING HIGH SPEED INTERNET. AND THEN WHEN YOU COMBINE THAT WITH DATA CAPS AND OTHER ISSUES YOU GET COMPLAINTS SAID FAMILIES WHO SAY- WE GET KICKED OFF- WE'RE NOT ABLE TO GET. YOU KNOW SUSTAINABLE INTERNET CONNECTION- MULTIPLE FAMILIES CANNOT BE ON AT THE SAME TIME. AND SO THERE ARE THESE HUGE CHALLENGES THAT. CONTINUE TO BE A CHALLENGE IN THAT- PO CENTER LAVINE I'VE TALKED ABOUT THE NEXT- SET OF MEETINGS FOR THE- CLOSING THE DIGITAL DIVIDE TASK FORCE TO FOCUS ON THINGS LIKE. THESE DATA CAPS AND SPEEDS YOU KNOW A FEW WEEKS AGO THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE DATE THROUGH- TO- TO AN EXECUTIVE BOARD TO TALK ABOUT STANDARD SPEEDS THAT PEOPLE SHOULD BE. WORKING TOWARDS AND- YOU KNOW I I'M SURE- THIS IS MY ME MUCH MORE SPEAK TO THAT- THROUGH OUR LANDS AT THE PC BUT THE REALITY IS THAT. NOT ALL FAMILIES IN CALIFORNIA HAVE ACCESS TO HIGH SPEED INTERNET AND IN PARTICULAR OUR LOW INCOME FAMILIES- FIND MORE TIMES THAN NOT THAT THEY DO. NOT HAVE ACCESS TO HIGH SPEED INTERNET. IS THOMAS WITH COVERED IN. EVEN RECOGNIZE THAT. ONCE WE ACTUALLY CAN LET KIDS GET BACK TO SCHOOL THEY'RE EITHER GONNA DO HYBRID FOR AWHILE OR WE MAY EVEN BE LOOKING AT. OTHER FORMS OF USING THE INTERNET IS THIS THIRD AS DIFFERENT. DIFFERENT. AT THE TOP OF EDUCATE OR SOMETHING ABOUT IS. FOR AT LEAST FROM AN EDGE ONE. WHICH BE. THE MINIMUM AT YOU KNO WHAT WHAT TO THE TYPICAL FOR OR HOW. WHAT'S THE MINIMUM LEVEL OF ACCESS THEY SHOULD HAVE TO BROADBAND IN ORDER FOR THEM TO ENGAGE FULLY AND EDUCATION WHICH IS A CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT ACTUALLY HERE IN THE CITY CALIFORNIA. WE PARTNERED WITH WITH THE PC WITH THE CPUC AND THEIR JOB AND- IN THE TECHNOLOGY DEPARTMENT REALLY THEY REALLY TAKING THE LEAD ON ESTABLISHING WHAT THOSE- SPEEDS IN METRIC SHOULD BE WE AGREE. THAT THERE SHOULD BE A- LEVEL PLAYING FIELD- SO THAT EVERYONE HAS ACCESS TO HIGH SPEED INTERNET AND SO WHEN WE REACHED OUT TO COMPANIES THAT HAVE SAID WE'RE GOING TO DONATE- YOU KNOW REDUCE COSTS. OF TECHNOLOGY IN HOT SPOTS WE'VE ASKED THEM TO MAKE THAT HIGH SPEED INTERNET AND SO- I CAN TELL THAT THIS WAS MY SERVICES IS TRYING TO GET TO ANSWER THIS QUESTION BECAUSE I'M IN HER LANE. AND BUT WE AGREE WITH WHERE THE P. C. P. C. IN OTHER PLACES ARE MEETING TO ENSURE THAT THERE IS HIGH SPEED INTERNET OKAY AND I DO WANT TO GET TO ACTUALLY A COMMISSIONER GUZMAN ASSET BUT JUST NEEDED ONE LAST QUESTION- SUPER DENT THURMOND. AND ALSO ASKED THE SAME QUESTION OF- THE COMMISSIONER- WE HEARD THAT THE FCC STANDARDS IS. THIRTY YEARS TWENTY FIVE DOWN THIRTY UP THAT IT'S PRIVATE CORRECTLY IS THAT SUFFICIENT AS AS THE PARTICIPATION LOOKED AT IT FOR A FAMILY. TO BE ABLE ENGAGE IN EDUCATION. I REALIZE PERHAPS A QUESTIONS A LOT MORE COMPLEX THAN SIMPLY ASKING THAT BUDGET IS BUT THERE'S A BASELINE IS THAT ENOUGH. AND WITH TO I CAN CLARIFY AS WELL THE FEDERAL STANDARD IS AS MENTIONED BY- MS MCINTYRE IS TWENTY FIVE- DOWNLOAD THREE UPLOAD RATE AND I KNOW I'M COMMISSIONER SERVICE CAN ELABORATE ON THIS- I THINK THE FEDERAL- STANDARD FOR WHAT WE'VE SEEN BIRTH. YOU KNOW MULTIPLE KIDS IN THE HOUSEHOLD I THINK HAS TO BE ABOVE TWENTY FIVE I THINK WE'VE SEEN GOALS OF A HUNDRED MEGABYTES UPS UPLOAD AND A HUNDRED MEGABYTES DOWNLOAD TO BE ABLE TO. SUSTAIN IN THIS ARGUMENT VARMINT. AND ALL KICK IT OFF TO IN THANK YOU MISTER SUPERINTENDENT AS WELL BUT I'LL KICK IT OFF TO COMMISSIONER US OF ITS WHO CONDUCTED THE TYPICALLY ABOUT THE CALIFORNIA STANDARDS. AS IT PERTAINS TO OUR SUBSIDIZE WORK- FOR SUBSIDIZED PLAN IN THE CALIFORNIA SERVICES FUND. NO THANK YOU. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION CENTER PAN I THINK THE- THE QUESTION IS THAT. THE FCC STANDARD TWENTY FIVE DOWN THREE UP WAS PRE COATED. RIGHT NOW. THE UPLOAD SPEED TO UP TO PARTICIPATE IN THE STEP OF RITUAL MEETING REQUIRES MORE THAN THREE UP. AND SO WE'RE LOOKING AT- A SITUATION WHERE AT MINIMUM WE SHOULD BE HAVING OUR CHILDREN AND ALL OF US REALLY TO BE ABLE TO ENGAGE IN ALL INTERACTIONS. AT A HUNDRED DOWN AND A HUNDRED UP. THE EXECUTIVE ORDER THAT SUPERINTENDENT THURMAN MENTION THE GOVERNOR SAID THE GOAL OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS A HUNDRED DOWN HE LOOKED KIND OF LEFT IT OPEN FOR THIS THE UP SPEED. BUT WE CAN TELL YOU FOR A FACT THAT. YOU KNOW THREE UP IS INSUFFICIENT WE WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO DO THIS CONVERSATION AND SO I KNOW DAY AND YOU HAD A REALLY GOOD POINT EARLIER ACTUALLY ON WHAT YOU SEE THE NEED AS THE NEED IS FIBER. WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE SPEEDS IT'S ALMOST LIKE ANOTHER TRICK IT'S BEEN USED AS KIND OF LIKE IS THIS THE INNER IS INTERNET A COMMUNICATION SERVICE OR AN INFORMATION SERVICE IT'S ANOTHER ONE OF THOSE TRICKS WE TALK ABOUT SPEED. WHAT WE NEED IS THE BEST INFRASTRUCTURE FOR ALL CITIZENS FOR ALL PEOPLE IN STATE CALIFORNIA AND THAT'S FIBER AND SO HUNDRED SYMMETRICAL IS A MINIMUM. FROM MY PERSPECTIVE FOR US TO HAVE YOU KNOW ONE OR TWO KIDS PARTICIPATING IN THE CLASSROOM BEING ABLE TO SEE THEIR TEACHER HAVE ALL THAT. ALL THOSE THINGS ARE TIED TO MENTAL HEALTH SO YOUR PANELISTS SPOKE OF EARLIER HE NEEDS. TO BE AT LEAST A HUNDRED SYMMETRICAL. JUST TO CLEAR WHAT MOTHER SAYING IS THAT. IT IS SOME TO KNOW THAT COPPER CANNOT PROVIDE THAT KIND OF UPLOAD SPEED SIGNIFICAN UPLOAD SPEEDS- BEYOND- YOU KNOW THE SIX MEGABITS PER SECOND- WE ALSO KNOW THAT IT'S- NOT CAPABLE OF DELIVERING A HUNDRED MEGABITS DOWN- IN ANY CASE. IN ANY ANY ANY ANY REAL COMMERCIAL BASIS. SO IT REALLY DEFINES- THESE SPEEDS THESE DEFINITIONS OF SPEEDS REALLY DEFINE- THE MEDIA. AND THAT IS STEP TO FUTURE IS FIBER. THANK YOU I GUESS MY DOT COM AND DEFERRED WRAP UP IS JUST THAT AND THAT THAT SORT OF GOT TO MY QUESTION I ASKED THE SUPERINTENDENT TO IS TO ME. OBVIOUSLY THESE ARE TECHNICAL QUESTIONS THAT ALSO NEED TO BE FIGURED OUT BUT WE HAVE A- RIGHT TO AN EDUCATION HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IN OUR CONSTITUTION. AND RIGHT NOW LEISTER EDUCATIONS. VERY DEPENDENT ON ACCESS TO BROADBAND. EIGHT SO AND OF AT LEAST A CERTAIN MINIMUM CAPACITY. WHATEVER THAT IS AND- DEBTS AND SO I HOPE THAT OUR DEPARTED EDUCATION. SO OUR SUPERINTENDENT IN OUR GOVERNOR CAN WORK TOGETHER AND DEFINE WHAT THAT IS. BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S A SEPARATE STANDARD AND JUST THE FTC STANDARD. BECAUSE WE DO HAVE. DON'T STUDENT CHILDREN HAVE A RIGHT TO AN EDUCATION HERE AND CITY CALIFORNIA AND SO WE DO NEED TO THINK ABOUT HOW WE MEET THAT STANDARD. AND WHAT KIND OF REQUIREMENTS AND DEMANDS WE NEED TO PUT ON- BUT IT'S OUR- SERVICE PROVIDERS ARE OTHER INFRASTRUCTURE FOLKS OR OTHER TYPES OF INVESTMENTS WE NEED TO MAKE COMES OF SUBSIDIES OR OTHER TYPES OF THINGS AS THE STATE GOVERNMENT AND ALSO WHAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS MAY NEED TO DO. IN ORDER TO TRIED IT IS SURE WE MEET AT CONSTITUTIONAL STANDARD OF THAT RIGHT OF EDUCATION THANK YOU. AND I KNOW YOU SAID YOU WANTED TO ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT OPENING AND THINGS THAT NEED TO WORK WITH YOU OFFLINE. OUR OFFICE WOULD ALSO BE HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOU ON THIS VERY ISSUE THAT YOU RAISE I JUST WANT TO BE CLEAR- WE CAN WORK WITH THE CPUC AND DEPARTMENT TRANSPORTATION. WE CAN PUT OUT A RECOMMENDATION BUT WITHOUT LEGISLATION OR REGULATION THEY WILL NOT HAVE ANY IMPACT. AND SO YOU KNOW. AGAIN WE'RE HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOU AND THE MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE ON A VERY SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS. IN CALIFORNIA WE'D BE HAPPY TO DO THAT. THANK YOU SUPERMAN THURMOND I LOOK FOR TO ARE. OFF LINE FOR THE CONVERSATION WITH YOU ABOUT THAT AND APPRECIATE YOUR LEADERSHIP THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR. THANK YOU SENATOR PAN. AM AND JUST TO BE CLEAR AS WELL- I HAVE TO MENTION THAT YOU KNOW THE ALIFORNIA SERVICES FUND RIGHT NOW AS IT STANDS IN CALIFORNIA WE ARE BELOW THE FEDERAL STANDARD. SIX DOWNLOAD SPEED ONE UPLOAD SPEED IS OUR CURRENT STANDARDS WERE WELL BELOW THE FEDERAL STANDARD- FOR MEANING FOR THOSE WHO COULD BE. DEFINED AS SERVED UNDER THAT PLAN- WITH THAT I JUST WENT LIVE. VEGAS MANAGER CAN I JUST MAKE IT CLEAR FIND TREATMENT HERE TO CAROLYN MCINTYRE. I DO WANT TO POINT OUT THAT AS THE CTA MEMBERS OFFERS SERVICE. AT SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER SPEEDS THAN TWENTY FIVE THREE- I SIMPLY WANTED TO RESPOND TO THE QUESTION EARLIER ABOUT WHAT WE CONSIDERED. INSUFFICIENT SERVICE AND THAT'S LESS THAN TWENTY FIVE THREE. BUT ALL OF THE CTA'S MEMBERS OFFER GIGABIT SERVICE. AND I WOULD LIKE TO BEG TO DIFFER WITH THE FACT THAT FIBER IS THE ONLY WAY TO GET THERE. MANY OF THESE NETWORKS ARE ON HIGH BRED. AND FIND BERMAN CALLING. AND SO I WOULD ON LIKE TO IT'S IN IN THE- TO THE LEGISLATURE TO ACTUALLY RECEIVE A PRESENTATION. ON NETWORK FUNCTIONALITY WHAT'S ACTUALLY NEEDED AND REAL DATA TO SUPPORT HOW THE NETWORK IS ACTUALLY BEING USED DURING HELP AT. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT PUBLIC POLICY DECISIONS ARE GOING TO BE BASED ON WHAT WE'RE ACTUALLY SEEING IN THE MARKET AND WHAT IS ACTUALLY AVAILABLE FROM A TECHNOLOGY NEUTRAL STANDPOINT. THANK YOU MISS MCINTYRE WE APPRECIATE THAT- AND JUST A VERY LAST QUESTION THAT I HAVE IN THE WE'RE GONNA TURN IT BACK OVER TO SENATOR LEYVA- TO TAKE ON A PUBLIC COMMENT- WAS JUST DIGITAL LITERACY I KNOW WE OFTEN TALK ABOUT THE HARDWARE AND WE TALKED VERY. IN DEPTH ABOUT THE INFRASTRUCTURE BUT HOW DO WE HELP PARENTS AND STUDENTS- IN A SIGNIFICANT WAY WITH DIGITAL LITERACY PROGRAMS AND- FOR THAT I WILL KICK THAT OFF TO A SUPERINTENDENT THURMOND IF YOU CAN ANSWER THAT AND HOW WE CAN JUST HELP YOU. MAKE THAT HAPPEN. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I APPRECIATE YOU ASKING THAT WE THINK THAT THIS CONVERSATION HAS TO BE MORE THAN JUST. PROVIDING A STUDENT WITH A COMPUTING DEVICE. OR A HOT SPOT. WE THINK THAT THERE ARE ONE WE HAD BEEN SUSTAINED- THE PROVISION OF EQUIPMENT OVER TIME- MANY OF OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE EQUIPMENT THAT THEY ARE USING EVEN THOSE THAT ARE IN A ONE TO ONE RELATIONSHIP. STUDENTS ARE USING DEVICES THAT OFTEN DON'T WORK WHEN THEY GO TO TAKE STANDARDIZED TESTS YOU KNOW THEY FIND THEMSELVES OPENING DEVICES FOR THE FIRST TIME BUT ALSO AREN'T WORKING. AREN'T FUNCTIONAL AND SO WE NEED A VERY BROAD A ROBUST PLANNED ON CLOSING THE DIGITAL DIVIDE. THAT IT LOOKS AT EQUIPMENT THAT LOOKS AT TRAINING FOR STUDENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES MANY OF OUR FAMILIES ARE ASKING FOR TRAINING. IN SUPPORT AND YOU KNOW MANY OF OUR EDUCATORS ARE ASKING FOR TRAINING ONE OF THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES THAT WE HEARD. WHEN THIS IS LEARNING BEGAN IN MARCH IS THAT THERE WERE JUST SOME EDUCATORS AND STAFF WHO JUST WEREN'T COMFORTABLE- YOU KNOW. USING THE COMPUTERS IN THE WAYS THAT THEY HAD NOT USED THEM BEFORE IS SO WE DO NEED DIGITAL. LITERACY AND TRAINING FOR EVERY ASPECT OF THE EDUCATIONAL FAMILY OF THOSE RESOURCES DON'T EXIST RIGHT NOW FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS- SOME DISTRICTS DO BETTER THAN OTHERS. BUT THOSE RESOURCES DON'T EXIST THIS IS EGGS DEFINITELY OPPORTUNITIES. FOR YOU THE NEW LEGISLATION OR FOR WORK IN THE BUDGET AND WE WOULD AGREE WITH YOU MADAM CHAIR THAT IS WE HAVE THIS CONVERSATION GOING FORWARD. IT ABSOLUTELY HAS TO FOCUS ON THE RECEIPT TRAINING AND SUPPORT. FOR THE STUDENTS THEIR FAMILIES AND EDUCATORS WILL BE USING THIS EQUIPMENT AND HOW TO SUSTAIN IT. A LOT OF OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAVE THIS KIND OF PATCHWORK QUILT OF DIFFERENT OPERATING SYSTEMS AND THINGS THAT THEY'RE USING. YOU KNOW WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE THINGS BE MORE EFFECTIVE IN STREAMLINED AND WILL RESOURCE IN A WELL MAINTAINED- AND WE APPRECIATE YOUR INTEREST. IN THE DIGITAL LITERACY WE HAVE TO WORK WITH YOU AND OTHERS ON THAT SUBJECT THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR SUPERINTENDENT AND I DO HAVE A QUESTION A. REYES TEN BY SENATOR DODD. YES PLANCHEREL TAKE YOU MUCH UP FOR VERY AND IN FOR ALL THE SPEAK FOR THIS VERY INFORMED CONVERSATION WHAT IT'S REALLY DRILL DOWN TO ME IS THAT THAT. THERE ARE SO MANY MORE QUESTIONS THAN THERE ARE ANSWERS- IN THIS PANEL THEY OBVIOUSLY WE HAVE THE SIGNIFICANT. DIGITAL DIVIDE LONG BEFORE- CODE NINETEEN AND WE SEE IN THE- DESPERATE- CHALLENGES THAT WE HAVE PARTICULARLY IN. LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES AND IT JUST HOW UNSETTLING THAT IS AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT LEGISLATION PERHAPS COMING OUT THIS YEAR. YEAH I AM VERY VERY VERY CONCERNED THAT THIS IS YEAH HUGELY COMPLICATED ISSUE THAT SOMETIMES WITH YEAH WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO THE TELL COMMUNITY CATIONS INDUSTRY IS MADE TO LOOK LIKE THIS BLACK BOX THAT- YELLOW. I DO YOU KNOW WHERE I'M GOING WITH THIS I REALLY THINK THAT WE NEED. YEAH A TASK FORCE THAT YOU KNOW I KNOW THE OVER HOUSTON PEOPLE SAY OH GEEZ THAT'S- YEAH I'M GONNA TAKE TOO MUCH TIME BUT THE REALITY IS HERE WE ARE. IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THE STATE OF INNOVATION. AND WHAT I JUST WHAT I DID HEARING YES AGAIN MORE QUESTIONS THAN WE HAVE ANSWERS TO WE NEED BETTER OUT. OF SPEED DOWNLOAD SPEED THAT IS YOU KNOW CLEAR TO BE BUT- IS FAR AS AFFORDABILITY IN GETTING OUR STUDENTS TO WHERE THEY'RE EVEN CLOSE TO WHERE THEY NEED TO BE. I DON'T KNOW HOW WE GET THERE I KNOW I APPRECIATE- SUPERINTENDED- SERMONS IS UP OUT SHE DIDN'T. IN WORK ETHIC ON THIS WE ALL NEED TO GET ON BOARD BUT I THINK WE GOT TO FIND OUT. SOME MORE CRITICAL- YOUR ASSAM REALLY DEEP QUESTIONS IN IT IT REALLY GET DOWN TO THE POINT WHERE WE KNOW WHERE WE'RE GOING INSTEAD OF. YOU KNOW MAKING THIS ON THE FLY YOU KNOW MAYBE SOME OF THESE OTHER COMPANIES HAVE THAT ALREADY AND WE HAVEN'T HEARD THAT THAT MAY BE A TOPIC. FOR ANOTHER BE MADAM CHAIRWOMAN AND I'D BE DELIGHTED TO HEAR THAT I WOULD LIKE TO. TAKE A- THIS MCINTYRE INTERPRETATION. TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THIS TOPIC CAN TAKE ME THROUGH. AND MAYBE OTHERS THROUGH WHAT. OF WHAT SHE WAS TALKING ABOUT THEIR TO GET MORE INFORMATION I'D SOUGHT I DO APPRECIATE EVERYBODY'S TIME AND EFFORT- THIS ON THIS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT TOPIC THANK YOU SENATOR DARDEN I HAVE SUPERINTENDED ME ASSURE WHO HAS TO STAND UP. THANK YOU I WASN'T SURE IF IT WAS APPROPRIATE TREES MAN ON THIS PANEL THAT TONY AND- AND SENATORS I WOULD LOVE TO HELP WITH THIS INITIATIVE. WE'VE BEEN VERY STRATEGIC AND THOUGHTFUL AND OUR TECHNOLOGY IMPLEMENTATION DEPLOYMENT. AND IT'S ALL INTERRELATED WITH ASSESSMENT DATA ACCOUNTABILITY IS NOT JUST A STANDALONE THING THAT YOU KNOW IF THE DEVICES AND THINGS CHANGE. BUT THAT'S- THE WAY WE BRING OUR EDUCATORS AND THE CONVERSATION EMPOWER THEM WITH THE TOOLS. TO LEARN ALONGSIDE WITH THE STUDENTS. BUT ALSO THING POST PANDEMIC YOU KNOW WHAT IS OUR LONG TERM TECHNOLOGY STRATEGY. THERE'S A TERM CALLED THE HOMEWORK GAP THAT EXISTED BEFORE KOVIN. AND REFERRED TO THE STUDENTS THAT HE DIDN'T HAVE ACCESS TO UBIQUITOUS AND FREE WIFI. A TO DO THEIR HOMEWORK AND DISTRICT LIKE OURS IT'S REQUIREMENTS OUR KIDS HAVE TO. ACCESS HIGH QUALITY DIGITAL TOOLS FROM THEIR HOME. SO IN TWENTY FOURTEEN WE MADE AN EFFORT TO CONNECT EVERY FAMILY BACK THEN KNOWING THAT THERE IS AN INEQUITY IF WE DIDN'T- IT'S EXCITING TO HEAR THE CONVERSATION HERE ABOUT. MAKING THIS MORE TO CALIFORNIA EFFORT- BUT WHEN YOU MANDATE THE COMMENT THAT WE CAN'T LEAVE THIS FOR SUPERINTENDENTS TO DO IT ON OUR OWN. I'M NOT ALONE IN IN LEADING A DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION. AND THERE ARE A FEW IN CALIFORNIA THAT I THINK ALONG WITH TONY CAN REALLY. MAKE IT EASIER FOR OTHERS TO START THINKING ABOUT WE JUST PURCHASED ALL THESE TOOLS. NOW HOW DO WE MAKE IT A UBIQUITOUS PART OF OUR OUR SYSTEM. THANK THE LITTLE WITH THAT THANK YOU SUPERINTENDENT- I WILL JUST CLOSE BY SAYING THAT- THIS TIME CALLS FOR CREATIVE AND BOLD SOLUTIONS WE CANNOT CALL OURSELVES ONCE AGAIN THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY WITH LEAVING. SO MANY KIDS BEHIND RULE A COMMUNITY CHILDREN URBAN KIDS AND EVERYONE IN BETWEEN ESPECIALLY SENIORS THAT NEED THIS FOR TELEHEALTH SERVICES AS WE'RE SEEING AN UPTICK. SO WITH THAT I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU SO MUCH TO THIS PANEL. I'M GONNA KICK IT BACK TO SENATOR LEYVA. SORRY ONE MOMENT.
