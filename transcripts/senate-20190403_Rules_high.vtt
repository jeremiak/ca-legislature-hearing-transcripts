00:08:05.184 --> 00:08:07.587
IN JUST THE PHYSICAL EMOTIONAL.

00:08:07.653 --> 00:08:12.158
FATIGUE AND SOMETIMES TRAUMA ON

00:08:12.225 --> 00:08:13.693
THE FRONT LINES OF FIRE.

00:08:13.759 --> 00:08:15.428
HELL IS CAL FIRE APPROACHING

00:08:15.494 --> 00:08:17.330
THAT MAYBE YOU COULD SHARE WITH

00:08:17.396 --> 00:08:19.298
THE COMMITTEE WHAT SOME O THE

00:08:19.365 --> 00:08:21.534
EXPECTED A DAYS OF SERVICE ARE

00:08:21.601 --> 00:08:23.102
WHEN YOU'RE.

00:08:23.169 --> 00:08:25.471
IN ACTIVE FIRE FIRE FIGHTING

00:08:25.538 --> 00:08:27.106
MODE BECAUSE I FOUND IT KIND OF

00:08:27.173 --> 00:08:29.275
AMAZING THE CONTINUOUS DAYS OF

00:08:29.342 --> 00:08:31.277
WORK.

00:08:31.344 --> 00:08:34.347
YES -- WE WE ASK A LOT OF OF OUR

00:08:34.413 --> 00:08:36.115
STATE FIREFIGHTERS -- AN

00:08:36.182 --> 00:08:37.950
EMERGENCY RESPONDERS ACROSS THE

00:08:38.017 --> 00:08:39.752
BOARD -- SOME OF THOSE ARE

00:08:39.819 --> 00:08:40.720
FIREFIGHTERS THEY'RE THEY'RE

00:08:40.786 --> 00:08:43.155
ALSO SUPPORT THROUGH ALL OF THE

00:08:43.222 --> 00:08:46.025
DIFFERENT AGENCIES THAT RESPOND --

00:08:46.092 --> 00:08:47.660
BUT I'LL SPEAK ON BEHALF OF CAL

00:08:47.727 --> 00:08:52.164
FIRE WE WE WE TRULY HAVE PASSED --

00:08:52.231 --> 00:08:54.166
OUR EMPLOYEES TO GO ABOVE AND

00:08:54.233 --> 00:08:56.903
BEYOND WE WE ARE SEEING A LONGER

00:08:56.969 --> 00:08:58.170
FIRE SEASON.

00:08:58.237 --> 00:08:59.472
IT'S ABOUT SEVENTY FIVE DAYS

00:08:59.538 --> 00:09:02.675
LONGER -- EVERY YEAR THAN IT HAS

00:09:02.742 --> 00:09:05.278
BEEN -- THAN IT WAS. TWENTY TO

00:09:05.344 --> 00:09:06.646
THIRTY YEARS AGO AND AND AND

00:09:06.712 --> 00:09:10.016
PREVIOUS TO THAT -- SO PEOPLE

00:09:10.082 --> 00:09:12.018
AREN'T GETTING THAT WINTER BREAK

00:09:12.084 --> 00:09:14.287
TO START AS EARLY OR THEIR

00:09:14.353 --> 00:09:15.554
SPRINGS THERE'S OUR ARCH CUT

00:09:15.621 --> 00:09:18.424
SHORT -- AND SO WHAT WE'RE

00:09:18.491 --> 00:09:21.928
FINDING IS -- THAT THE

00:09:21.994 --> 00:09:26.465
TRADITIONAL -- JUST GO GO GO --

00:09:26.532 --> 00:09:29.869
IS IS VERY DIFFICULT TO MAINTAIN

00:09:29.936 --> 00:09:32.772
AND THE WHAT WE BEN -- AND IT'S

00:09:32.838 --> 00:09:38.844
IT'S NOT A ABSOLUTE FOR MORE --

00:09:38.911 --> 00:09:40.346
FOURTEEN DAYS AND TWENTY ONE

00:09:40.413 --> 00:09:41.347
DAYS BUT THOSE ARE THE TWO

00:09:41.414 --> 00:09:43.582
BREAKING POINTS THAT WE USE --

00:09:43.649 --> 00:09:46.519
WHEN AN INDIVIDUAL A IS OUT FOR

00:09:46.585 --> 00:09:49.055
FOURTEEN DAYS THEY NEED TO HAVE

00:09:49.121 --> 00:09:50.823
A RESET FOR A DAY?

00:09:50.890 --> 00:09:54.260
IF IT'S IF THEY'RE GONNA BE OUT

00:09:54.327 --> 00:09:54.860
FOR TWENTY ONE DAYS IT'S A TWO

00:09:54.927 --> 00:09:55.795
DAY RESET.

00:09:55.861 --> 00:10:00.199
AND AS IT STANDS -- IN IN OUR

00:10:00.266 --> 00:10:03.769
INFORMAL POLICY NOW -- WE WE WE

00:10:03.836 --> 00:10:07.673
DON'T HAVE A MECHANISM TO RETURN

00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:09.775
THEM HOME AT THAT POINT -- IS

00:10:09.842 --> 00:10:11.477
THAT IS NOT A REQUIREMENT AND

00:10:11.544 --> 00:10:12.945
THAT IS DOING THAT ONE OR TWO

00:10:13.012 --> 00:10:14.513
DAY BREAK THAT IS TRUE AND THAT

00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:15.548
IS SOMETHING THAT THAT IS

00:10:15.614 --> 00:10:18.084
CONCERNING TO ME THAT WE HAVE --

00:10:18.150 --> 00:10:19.919
FIREFIGHTERS AND EMERGENCY

00:10:19.986 --> 00:10:22.021
RESPONDERS THAT ARE OUT FOR

00:10:22.088 --> 00:10:23.456
TWENTY ONE DAYS MAY HAVE TWO

00:10:23.522 --> 00:10:25.624
DAYS OF OF RECOVERY IN A HOTEL

00:10:25.691 --> 00:10:27.693
AND GO BACK TO WORK FOR ANOTHER --

00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:28.761
TWENTY ONE DAYS AND THAT CAN

00:10:28.828 --> 00:10:31.397
HAPPEN OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND

00:10:31.464 --> 00:10:34.033
AND FIREFIGHTERS **** AT TIMES

00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:35.935
HAVE BEEN OUT FOR A SIXTY PLUS

00:10:36.002 --> 00:10:36.602
DAYS.

00:10:36.669 --> 00:10:38.604
WITHOUT EVER GETTING HOME TO SEE

00:10:38.671 --> 00:10:39.972
THEIR FAMILIES THAT SUBJECT TO

00:10:40.039 --> 00:10:42.942
REVIEW CURRENTLY IS ARE THEIR

00:10:43.009 --> 00:10:44.076
BREAKING POINT SWEAR.

00:10:44.143 --> 00:10:45.745
ADDING AN EXTRA DAY TO RESET

00:10:45.811 --> 00:10:46.645
WERE.

00:10:46.712 --> 00:10:49.749
AFTER FORTY DAYS SIR FIFTY DAYS

00:10:49.815 --> 00:10:51.884
YOU GET A WEEK OR SOMETHING --

00:10:51.951 --> 00:10:53.719
THAT WOULD HELP.

00:10:53.786 --> 00:10:55.888
IT'S THE A WHO WE NEED TO REVIEW

00:10:55.955 --> 00:10:58.157
THE ENTIRE OUR OUR ENTIRE SYSTEM

00:10:58.224 --> 00:10:59.859

IN MAKING ADJUSTMENTS ON THE FLY

00:11:04.997 --> 00:11:06.866
AND I'LL SAY THAT IS WHILE THESE

00:11:06.932 --> 00:11:08.334
THESE -- SEASONS HAVE BEEN

00:11:08.401 --> 00:11:12.972
WEARING ON IS THAT WE WE DON'T

MAINTAIN THE HOMES ARE LESS

00:15:34.833 --> 00:15:37.936
LIKELY TO BURN -- IT IS NOT A

00:15:38.003 --> 00:15:41.373
SILVER BULLET AS AS I MENTIONED

00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:43.909

00:15:49.248 --> 00:15:50.683
SOMETHING THE LANDOWNER CAN DO.

00:15:50.749 --> 00:15:55.521

THE DANGER THERE -- I ON A LAST

00:17:55.808 --> 00:17:57.309
QUESTION AND I IN ANOTHER ONE

00:17:57.376 --> 00:17:59.578
THAT WE DISCUSS WITH THEM

PLANNED THAT.

00:18:16.161 --> 00:18:17.863
AND CERTAINLY THE OVERSIGHT OF

00:18:17.930 --> 00:18:19.264
THE FIRE THIRTY AT THAT TIME

00:18:19.331 --> 00:18:22.468
REGARDING THAT ISSUE WAS BROUGHT

IS SLEEP DEPRIVATION AND THEN --

00:24:14.553 --> 00:24:18.056
WHAT THAT THEN CAUSES -- IN THE

00:24:18.123 --> 00:24:19.925
FUTURES FOR AS FAR AS ONCE

00:24:19.991 --> 00:24:21.960

YOU BECOME.

00:24:24.596 --> 00:24:26.431
OF MORE SLEEP DEPRIVED AND THEN

00:24:26.498 --> 00:24:27.465

ALL OF THESE DIFFERENT -- THE

00:24:55.527 --> 00:24:56.728
STUDIES THAT ARE OUT THERE THAT

00:24:56.795 --> 00:24:59.097
ARE THAT ARE GOING TO BE HELPFUL

00:24:59.164 --> 00:25:04.603
IN IN HIS -- CRAFTING A PROGRAM

00:25:04.669 --> 00:25:05.370

REALLY BE SPECIFIC TO THE

00:25:06.838 --> 00:25:08.406
INDIVIDUAL AND THE SITUATION

00:25:08.473 --> 00:25:10.976
THAT THEY'RE THEY'RE SEEING.

00:25:11.042 --> 00:25:12.777
I WAS.

00:25:12.844 --> 00:25:14.079
SEVEN IMPRESSED WITH THE FACT

00:25:14.145 --> 00:25:15.780
THAT YOU'RE FIELDING FIELD

00:25:15.847 --> 00:25:18.383
SUPPORT UNITS WERE --

00:25:18.450 --> 00:25:20.452
FIREFIGHTERS CAN COMMON.

00:25:20.518 --> 00:25:22.020

00:25:22.087 --> 00:25:24.890
QUESTION I DO HAVE OR A POINT IN

00:25:24.956 --> 00:25:26.892
A I WOULD HOPE THAT.

00:25:26.958 --> 00:25:28.960
WE'RE IN WE'RE NOT AS A WAITING

00:25:29.027 --> 00:25:30.762
FOR PEOPLE TO COME TO US I KNOW

00:25:30.829 --> 00:25:31.997
IN THE AS I RECALL IN THE

00:25:32.063 --> 00:25:34.900
MILITARY WE HAD A CONCEPT OF IT

00:25:34.966 --> 00:25:35.667
WE CALL BUDDY CARE.

00:25:35.734 --> 00:25:38.236
WHERE -- MILITARY MEMBERS WERE

00:25:38.303 --> 00:25:41.306
TRAINED TO OBSERVE SIGNS AND

00:25:41.373 --> 00:25:42.707
SIGNALS OF INDIVIDUALS IN

00:25:42.774 --> 00:25:44.242
DISTRESS.

00:25:44.309 --> 00:25:46.511
AND TO BRING THAT.

00:25:46.578 --> 00:25:48.313
ISSUE OR THE PEOPLE TO THE

00:25:48.380 --> 00:25:50.048
ATTENTION OF THOSE WHO CAN BEST

00:25:50.115 --> 00:25:51.316
DEAL WITH THE PROBLEM.

00:25:51.383 --> 00:25:52.584
AND I WOULD HOPE THAT AS YOU'RE

00:25:52.651 --> 00:25:55.253
FORMULATING YOUR POLICIES YOU

00:25:55.320 --> 00:25:57.389
YOU LOOK TO THAT INTO TRAINING

00:25:57.455 --> 00:26:00.225
PROGRAMS TRAINING.

00:26:00.292 --> 00:26:01.893
YOUR FIRE CREWS TO TO WATCH FOR

00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:03.762
SIGNALS OF INDIVIDUALS WHO READ

00:26:03.828 --> 00:26:05.263
DISTRESS BECAUSE OF SLEEP

00:26:05.330 --> 00:26:07.332
DEPRIVATION -- LENGTHY

00:26:07.399 --> 00:26:08.767
DEPLOYMENTS ARE TIME AWAY FROM

00:26:08.833 --> 00:26:09.834
FAMILIES.

00:26:09.901 --> 00:26:11.469
SO THAT IF THOSE INDIVIDUALS

00:26:11.536 --> 00:26:13.405
DON'T SELF IDENTIFY FOR WHATEVER

00:26:13.471 --> 00:26:14.839
REASON -- PRESSURE THAT EXISTS

00:26:14.906 --> 00:26:17.709
OUT THERE WE GET THEM.

00:26:17.776 --> 00:26:18.843
TO THE APPROPRIATE PEOPLE WHO

00:26:18.910 --> 00:26:22.080
