HAVING A SEVEN THREE FOUR. WE WILL BEGIN OUR REGION ITEM ONE SO BILL. TEN AND THAT IS SENATOR GONZALEZ AND CALLED WILL BECAUSE THE BILL BY TODAY SENATOR COMPARED MAY THIS IS THE- THANK YOU VERY MUCH CHAIR AND- THANK YOU FOR THE ON. TO SB FOR TEN AS PER CALL. AS FOURTEEN TO IS THE CAL EMERGENCY SOLUTION AND HOW PRO. PROVIDE EMERGENCY AS- FOR THOSE OWN AND WHO HAVE BEEN NAY NAY. AFFECT BY THE PROVIDE NINETY VIRUS RENTAL ON SUPER IN THE PER. WOULD AGREED ONE EXCEPT 8% OF THE RAY AND THE REMAINING PERCENT TO NOT CHARGE LATE. THREE NO. THE RENT FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE YEAR. AND FOR NOT FILE IN THE T. BASED ON PAYMENT PAYMENT RED RIVER THREE ANY PERIOD FOR WHICH THERE EXCEPT. SB FOR TEN IS TO FINANCE SECURE. AND WELL BEING OF CAL RENTER WHO BY FAULT OF THEIR OWN LUSTER HAD SIGNIFICAN REDUCTION IN THEIR INCOMES AS A RESULT OF THIS PANDEMIC. I KNOW THAT THERE ARE CONCERNS OF AMONG THE OPPONENTS THAT THE BILL THAT SHOULD NOT BE VOLUNTARY ON THE PART OF THE LANDLORD AND WHILE THOSE ARE VALID CONCERN THE BILL REDUCES THE AMOUNT. OF RENT AN OWNER CAN COLLECT AND THERE COULD BE LEGAL CHALLENGES OVER MANDATORY REDUCTIONS. THERE ARE NO PROGRAMS TODAY OFFER RENTAL ASSISTANCE SUCH AS THIS I AM CERTAINLY WILLING TO WORK WITH THE SENATE LEADERSHIP. TO FIND AN ALTERNATIVE FOR PROVIDE RELIEF THAT IS MANDATORY. OTHER PROPOSALS UNDER CONSIDERATION BY THE SENATE LEADERSHIP WILL PROVIDE RENT PAYMENTS AND TAX CREDIT FOR LANDLORDS OVER A TEN YEAR PERIOD. STARTING IN TWENTY TWENTY FOUR WHICH IS ALSO PROPOSED AS A BOTH A VOLUNTARY PROGRAM. HOWEVER WITH THE RENTER'S NEED AND WHAT BE FOURTEEN TO PROPOSE IS TO PROVIDE RENT RELIEF SOON. RATHER THAN LATER FOR OWNERS WHO CAN'T. MAKE IT AND TELL TWENTY TWENTY FOUR. THE OPPOSITION ALSO POINTS OUT THAT THE BILL DOES NOT TARGET OWNERS INTENDED TENANTS MOST IN NEED AGAIN GIVEN THE STATE'S BUDGETARY CONSTRAINTS THAT IS CERTAINLY A VALID POINT IT CAN BE CONSIDERED. ULTIMATELY APPROPRIATIONS HAVE TO CONSIDER THE PRICE TAG FOR THE BILL AND CREATE A FRAMEWORK THAT TARGETS THOSE MOST IN NEED. THE BOTTOM LINE IS IT ACCOUNT- NOTHING THIS IS THENUMBER ONE CONCERN IN MY DISTRICT THE FEAR OF INFECTION BECAUSE OF THE ECONOMIC SITUATION IS BECAUSE BEEN CREATED BECAUSE OF THIS PANDEMIC. IF THIS BILL WERE STALLED I KNOW OF NOTHING THE PROVIDES DIRECT ASSISTANCE THE CALIFORNIA RENTERS. I WOULD LIKE TO CONTINUE TO MOVE THE BILL TO FIND A SOLUTION FOR THOSE MOST IN NEED. AND DOLLARS THAT ARE AVAILABLE SOONER RATHER THAN LATER WE ALL KNOW THAT EVICTION IS A BIG CONCERN ONCE THE COURT OPEN AND WE DESPERATELY DESPERATELY NEED TO FIND AHLERS.

THE COMMITTEES- DO ANY MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE HAVE QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS ABOUT AS THE FOURTEEN TIME CENTER MORE LOCK. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. I WANT TO THANK. THE AUTHOR IN THE PRESENTER FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD AND FOR CLARIFYING THAT THIS IS NOT THE TEN YEAR PAY BACK PLANNER THE TWENTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS. ECONOMIC RECOVERY SO THANKS FOR CLARIFYING THAT I AM. I AM CONCERNED ABOUT A FEW ISSUES THEY WERE BROUGHT UP- BY THOSE THAT PARTICIPATED IN THE CALLS AND- PHIL THE FIRST IS. THE ADMINISTRATIVE CONCERNED SOMEONE MENTIONED A MILLION APPLICATIONS WE'VE WE'VE BEEN DEALING WITH THE EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT. RECEIVING APPLICATIONS WORK WE'RE DEALING WITH IT AS LEGISLATORS ARE HEARD THE LAST NUMBER WAS THAT SEVEN THOUSAND CALLS A DAY COME FROM OUR OFFICES TO THE E. D. T. THE HELP CONSTITUENTS FILL THE EDT IS A MESS. DMV WITH A BILL IDEAS BEEN A MESS- EVEN THE UNDOCUMENTED WORKERS TRYING TO GET. STATE FUNDS THAT'S BEEN A MESS- SO I AM REAL CONCERNED ABOUT. WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN AT THIS PROGRAM IS IMPLEMENTED WITH THE HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT. DEPARTMENT WE'RE LOOKING AT SOME KIND OF MANAGEMENT TRANSITION. WHAT KIND OF SOFTWARE. I'M JUST CONCERNED SIDE I'D I'D LOVE TO HEAR. HOW WE'RE GOING TO RAMP UP FOR SOMETHING LIKE THIS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT THAT QUESTION- LET ME JUST SAY THAT THAT- THIS REALLY IS A WORK IN PROGRESS WE STARTED OFF THINKING EIGHT CD IS A PROGRAM THAT THAT. WORKED WELL IN THE EIGHTIES CD WE'VE GIVEN THEM A LOT OF WORK TO DO OVER THE PAST COUPLE YEARS AND THEY'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE THE BAND WITH AND SO ONE OF THE AMENDMENTS WAS TO ALLOW THEM TO. PARTICIPATE AS A- AS A PARTNER WITH NON. IT MAY MAKE MORE SENSE TO GO TO LOCAL. ORGANIZATIONS IN EACH ONE OF THE COUNTIES BUT BUT LET ME JUST SAY THAT WHENEVER YOU'RE DEALING WITH A PANDEMIC. AND YOU'VE GOT THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE THAT ARE AFFECTED HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE THAT ARE AFFECTED. IT'S ALWAYS GOING TO BE A CHALLENGE. TO IDENTIFY WHAT PART OF GOVERNMENT IS GOING TO BE ABLE TO TAKE ON THE RESPONSIBILITY TO HANDLE A LOT OF PAPERWORK. AND THE AND THE- OVERSEE. MAKE SURE ANY IS ACTUALLY GETTING WHERE IT SHOULD GO AND SO- WITH THAT IN MIND ALMOST ANY ORGANIZATION THAT WE CHARGE WITH THIS KINDS OF KIND OF RESPONSIBILITY IS GOING TO HAVE A CHALLENGE BUT I DO THINK THAT IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE RECOGNIZE THAT THAT PROBABLY PEOPLE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL KNOW HOW TO DISTRIBUTE AND HOW TO SET UP FOR START. BETTER FIGURE OUT THAT. AND WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO BE OPPORTUNITY FOR THEM TO STAFF UP THE END HAPPY INFRASTRUCTURE IN PLACE TO BE ABLE TO DEAL WITH THIS BUT I. QUESTION BECAUSE I THINK WE'VE ALL DEALING WITH IT. THE ISSUE WITH THE V. D. QUITE FRANKLY AS WE HAD A THREE POINT 8% UNEMPLOYMENT RATE AND SO THEY WERE PERFECTLY STAFFED. FOR A THREE POINT 8% UNEMPLOYMENT AND QUITE FRANKLY IT HAD THEY HAD TOO MANY EMPLOYEES. AT BUDGET TIME WE WOULD HAVE BEEN SAYING WHY WE HAVE SO MANY PEOPLE WORKING A DVD EITHER BUDGET IS INFLATED WE NEED TO CUT REESE SAYS. BUT FROM A THREE POINT. NUMBER NOW IS ABOUT 15% THAT'S HUGE IN. AND DOES. IS ALL THE FACT THAT THERE'S BEEN SOME HICCUPS IN IN GETTING ARE BUT BUT WE DO IT IS IT THE REALITY OF THE SITUATION IS THAT ALMOST ANYWHERE WE PUT THIS IS GOING TO BE DIFFICULT AND I HAVE NO. NO IN. THE CITY IT'S- A QUESTION OF HAVING THEM BE THE ADMINISTRATORS OF A PROGRAM AND THEN GET IT GETTING THE LOCAL RESOURCES NECESSARY TO. TO ROLL THIS KIND OF PROGRAM. ONE DAY YOU'RE LOOKING AT OPTIONS AND ALTERNATIVES- BECAUSE WE'VE GOT THIS CAL AS WELL WHICH HAS BEEN A BILLION DOLLAR SOFTWARE PROBLEM- BUT I. DIDN'T DO SOME RESEARCH. AND THE STATE OF RHODE ISLAND. WAS ABLE TO MOVE PAGE IT'S UNEMPLOYMENT. IMPLOSION RATHER QUICKLY AND- SO THEY- THEY USE SOFTWARE THAT WAS. IN THE CAR IT WAS IT. AND SO THEY'VE BEEN GIVING A THE BEST IT'S PROMPTLY SO MAYBE THERE'S SOME. THAT WE SHOULD LOOK AT THAT TO HELP. WITH THIS PROGRAM- THE NEXT QUESTION I HAD. WAS SINCE FOR ESTABLISHING A NEW- THERE WOULD REQUIRE BUREAUCRACY BUT IT WOULD ALSO REQUIRE A LOT OF FUNDING. SO I'M JUST CURIOUS. EVEN THOUGH I DON'T BELIEVE THAT A LOT OF THESE. PEOPLE THAT WERE LAID OFF THERE WAS SORT OF A SELF INFLICTED BY BY THE CAPITAL SO NEEDS TO STEP UP IN SOME WAY I JUST DON'T KNOW WHERE THE MONEY'S GOING TO BE COMING FROM AND OF COURSE SHOULD HAVE FROM THE GENERAL FUND. OKAY SO IT'S A BUDGET PRIOR FIFTH OFFICE OF IT TODAY BECAUSE I THINK THE STATE HAS A RESPONSIBILITY. BECAUSE IT KIND OF. CREATED SOME OF THIS PROBLEM SO- BUT I I'M CONCERNED ABOUT. HOW WE MANAGE IT SO THAT WE JUST DON'T FRUSTRATE A LOT OF GOOD PEOPLE EVEN MORE I UNDERSTAND THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER. CENTER THERE ARE. YES THANK YOU CENTER SKINNER- ONE MILLION PEOPLE IN THE STATE OF RHODE ISLAND SO. IT'S QUITE A DIFFERENCE FROM WHAT WE FACE IN CALIFORNIA. BUT I- I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT RESPONSE THAT- CENTER RECOVERY IT'LL JUST BE OFF. THE AUTHOR CO AUTHOR. OF JUST PRESENTED- I AND I APPRECIATE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN OTHER PROPOSALS WHICH IS- WOULD TAKE A LITTLE BIT MORE TIME TO SOMETHING THAT'S NEEDED RIGHT NOW- I THINK YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. IN SAYING THAT. THE ORGANIZATIONS ON THE GROUND- HAVE THE EXPERIENCE NOT TO HANDLE YOU KNOW HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE DESPERATE BUT THEY CERTAINLY HAVE A SENSE OF HOW TO DO IT ON THE GROUND AND SO. I APPRECIATE THAT THE AUTHOR IS GOING TO REACH OUT TO THOSE ORGANIZATIONS IT'S BEST DONE WITH THEM IN MIND ON THE PRACTICAL SIDE OF IT- BECAUSE ON THE ISSUE OF. WHETHER OR NOT WE SHOULD DO THIS WE ABSOLUTELY SHOULD DO IT. THEY'RE GOING TO FACE IT NOW IN A LITTLE BIT MORE ORGANIZED WAY OR WE'RE GOING TO FACE IT ONE HUNDREDS OF. PEOPLE ARE THEY- ALL EVERYONE IS GOING TO- OF JUST BE IN THAT DESPERATE MULTIPLE. AGAIN THEM THE I THINK THE PRIORITY IS DEFINITELY THOSE WHO ARE THE MOST IN NEED RIGHT AWAY AND REACH THE HEART- GET GET TO THE HARD TO REACH COMMUNITIES SELF EMPLOYED UNDOCUMENTED. AND LANGUAGE LANGUAGES THAT CALIFORNIA'S SPEAK- SO I WILL SUPPORT THIS AND I HOPE- THAT WE CAN- AT LEAST FOR NOW ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE IMMEDIATE ISSUES AND I WOULD ERR ON THE SIDE OF- BEANS TO IT. AND AS QUICK AS POSSIBLE AND NOT BEING BURDEN TO SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO TAKE. A REALLY LONG TIME AND I THINK THAT'S WHERE YOU'RE COMING FROM AS WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU CENTER CABALLERO. ROSS SO- THERE ARE COMMON OR QUESTIONS. OKAY SEEING NINE- I- IN SUPPORT OF A MOVING IS OUT OF COMMITTEE FOR THIS BILL- STILL NEEDS ADDITIONAL WORK BOTH IN TERMS OF A MECHANISM- AND- AND OTHERWISE- TYPICALLY- WITH THIS- STATE RENTAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN- MOVED THROUGH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AS OPPOSED TO THE STATE. HAVING A DIRECT RELATIONSHIP- CAN THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE SOMETIMES IN A BETTER POSITION TO DO ITEM AND EVEN THOUGH THERE ARE. REASONS WHY THE HASN'T WORKED SO WELL- THESE DAYS YOU KNOW IT DOES SHOW THAT OUR OUR STATE AGENCIES CAN GET OVERWHELMED. FOR A STATE OF FORTY MILLION PEOPLE- BUT WITH THAT SAID I I'M I THINK WE SHOULD MOVE THIS FORWARD- TO CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION. I ALSO WANT TO KNOW AND SOME OF THE OPPOSITION CALLERS- THIS BILL DOES NOT A VICTIM PROTECTIONS- AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO EVERYTHING ALL IN ONE BILL THIS IS ABOUT FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE. WE DO NEED CONTINUING STRONG AFFECTION PROTECTIONS BECAUSE OF WHAT ENDS UP HAPPENING IS PEOPLE DON'T PAY THE RENT AND ULTIMATELY GET SOME ASSISTANCE AT SOME POINT. BUT THEY'VE ALREADY. GOT A THREE DAY NOTICE OR- OR WHATEVER. IT DEFEATS THE PURPOSE I WILL NOTE THAT THE GOVERNOR'S DIRECTION- EXECUTIVE ORDER EXPIRES ON SUNDAY. AND OUR CITIES ARE NOT YET RENEW THEIR LOCAL ELECTION MORATORIUM- BECAUSE THEY'RE WAITING FOR THE GOVERNOR. BY THE BACK OF. THE THIS. CONVERSATION WITH HER OF FINDING FIVE ZERO ZERO AND I WROTE A CIRCLE IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE THANK YOU MUCH MISTER I WANT TO SAY I THANK THAT THE TENANTS AND TENANTS WRITER OF PURCHASE I'M I'M I ALWAYS APPRECIATE HEARING FROM THEM AND I'VE I'VE TAKEN NOTES- I JUST WANT TO CALL OUT THAT THE BILL. DOES NOT DISCRIMINATE AGAINST AND THE SELF EMPLOYED AN UNDOCUMENTED WE EXPECT THAT THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE THE SAME KIND OF DATA ABOUT THE PANDEMIC AFFECTING THEM THAT ANYONE ELSE WOULD HAVE BEEN SO WE EXPECT THAT EVERYONE WILL BE ABLE TO QUALIFY AND ALSO THAT THERE ARE OBJECTION PROTECTIONS IN THE BILL FOR THE POOR TO. THE PROGRAM. BY THAT PACIFIC IS DESIGNED TO HEY IF. YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GONNA PARTISAN AS A LAW. YOU GOING TO YOU'RE GOING TO GET UP CERTAIN. AND PART OF THAT IS THE- TO AFFECT THE TENANTS THAT ABILITY TO GET ONE HUNDRED PERCENT. THE INABILITY TO GET A 100% OF THAT OF THE RENT. AND THE OF THE ABILITY TO RAISE THE RENT SO. WITH WITH THAT IN MIND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I DO WE HAVE A MOTION. MOTION BY CENTER LIKE HEALTH NEEDS. I WILL CALL THE ROLL.
