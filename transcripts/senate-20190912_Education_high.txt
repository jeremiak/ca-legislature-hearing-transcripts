MORNING SENATORS RETURNING WORKS AND ON BEHALF OF THE WESTERN ELECTRICAL CONTRACTORS ASSOCIATION WHILE WE SUPPORT THE UNDERLYING PRINCIPLE OF FUNDING FOR A SCHOOL FACILITIES I WERE OPPOSED TO THE MEASURE FOR THE EXACT REASON THAT MISTER DE AS A MENTIONED. IN SECTION TWELVE THE PRIORITIZATION OF UP LA PROJECTS WE THINK THIS IS A BAD PUBLIC POLICY FOR REASONS OF FIRST OF ALL. WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT A COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT OF PRIORITIZATION BELONGS IN A SCHOOL FACILITIES MEASURE LIKE THIS. A SECOND APPEAL ACE DISCRIMINATE THEY DISCRIMINATE EIGHT AGAINST APPRENTICES AND- WORKERS AND CONTRACTORS WHO ARE MERIT SHOP CONTRACTORS AND EMPLOYEES. OF HEARD. STUDIES HAVE DEMONSTRATED THE PROJECT LABOR AGREEMENTS ACTUALLY INCREASE SCHOOL CONSTRUCTION COSTS THE NATIONAL UNIVERSITY STUDY SUGGESTED THAT PROJECT LABOR AGREEMENTS INCREASE SCHOOL CONSTRUCTION BY 15222% THUS IF YOU ARE GIVING THESE PRIORITIES THOSE DISTRICTS WILL BE ABLE TO DELIVER LESS FOR THEIR PROJECTS UNDER PROJECT LABOR AGREEMENT. FOURTH FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF SMALL DISTRICTS IN OF. RURAL AND SUBURBAN AREAS. EQUALLY QUALIFIED PROJECTS NOW IN A LOT WILL LARGE URBAN SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO HAVE A PROJECT LABOR AGREEMENT WILL HAVE A HIGHER PRIORITY. MANY OF THE DISTRICTS IN YOUR OWN AREAS WILL BE AT A COMPETITIVE DISADVANTAGE WITH LARGE URBAN DISTRICTS THAT HAVE PROJECT LABOR AGREEMENTS AND FINALLY WE'RE VERY CONCERNED THAT THE INCLUSION OF THIS LANGUAGE WILL. POTENTIALLY DISSUADE VOTERS FROM APPROVING THE BOND IN MARCH THEY WILL SEE IT AS ANOTHER EXAMPLE AS A GIFT TO SPECIAL INTEREST GROUPS THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH SCHOOL CONSTRUCTION AND SCHOOL FACILITIES FOR THOSE REASONS WE ARE OPPOSED THANK YOU SIR. NEXT IN OPPOSITION OR IN BETWEEN. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS NANCY TRIED ASSISTING US ON BEHALF OF THE COALITION FOR ADEQUATE SCHOOL HOUSING UNFORTUNATELY GIVEN THE TIME CONSTRAINTS WE WERE NOT ABLE TO GET TO EITHER A SUPPORT REPOSE POSITION BUT WE DO HAVE JUST A VERY BRIEF COMMENTS. WE HAVE TO BEGIN WITH OUR THANKS FOR TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER O'DONNELL AND HIS STAFF AN EXTRAORDINARY EXTRAORDINARY AMOUNT OF WORK THAT'S GONE INTO THIS WE ARE VERY APPRECIATIVE. THE COALITION FOR ADEQUATE SCHOOL HOUSING IS THE ONLY STATEWIDE ADVOCACY GROUP DEDICATED TO K. TWELVE FACILITIES ISSUES WE HAVE MANY CONCERNS WERE ADDRESSED IN OUR LETTER WE WILL TAKE UP YOUR TIME GETTING INTO THOSE NOW EXCEPT TO SAY. WE DO HOPE THAT THEY WILL BE ADDRESSED AND FOLLOW UP LEGISLATION OR REGULATIONS THE PARTY TO ONE ADDRESSES THE DEVELOPER FEE PROHIBITION AND REDUCTION WHICH HAS BEEN REJECTED MULTIPLE TIMES BY THE HOUSING AND GOVERNMENTAL FINANCED COMMITTEES IN BOTH THE ASSEMBLY AND LEGISLATURE. OF ACKNOWLEDGEMENT THAT SCHOOL DISTRICTS CAN NOT FUND CAPITAL PROJECTS WITHOUT THE SOURCE OF FUNDING SO WE'RE VERY ENCOURAGED BY THE AUTHORED BY MR O'DONNELL'S I'M COMMITMENT TO CONTINUE TO FOLLOW AND MONITOR THAT ISSUE. AND THE CASH BOARD WILL DETERMINE WHETHER AND TO WHAT EXTENT IT REMAINS INVOLVED WITH THIS BOND BUT UNFORTUNATELY IT CAN'T DO THAT BEFORE. THE END OF SESSION THANK YOU. THANK YOU. NEXT. EARNING REBEKAH CURLY ON BEHALF OF THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE FACILITY COALITION AND THE COUNTY SCHOOL FACILITIES CONSORTIUM. WERE IN A SIMILAR POSITION TO VOTE PRIOR WITNESS. WE HAVE NOT HAD THE TIME TO FULLY THAT AND ANALYZE THE IMPACT THAT THE AMENDMENTS WILL HAVE ON THIS BILL. AS IN PARTICULAR FOR COUNTY OFFICES WE BELIEVE THAT WE WOULD BENEFIT FROM THE FINANCIAL HARDSHIP PRIORITY BUT WE REALLY SHARE THE CONCERNS THAT WERE RAISED EARLIER REGARDING PROCESSING. AND WE JUST WEREN'T ABLE TO GET TO A POSITION IN TIME THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU TO ALL THE WITNESSES. WHERE WERE YOU BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ANY QUESTIONS. DOCTOR PM. THANK YOU AND I WANT TO THANK BOTH THE AUTHORS FOR THEIR WORK ON THIS VERY IMPORTANT BOND. AS A FORMER MEMBER OF THE STATE ALLOCATION BOARD. WE HAVE ALREADY COMMITTED ESSENTIALLY ALL THE PRIOR BONDS AND I GUESS WERE NOW RUNNING A LIST OF. PEOPLE WHO THERE'S NO COMMITMENT RIGHT SO HOW. THE TERMS OF WHEN THIS BOND PASSES WHAT HAPPENS THERE WE GO BACKWARDS TO THE TO THE PEOPLE WHO ARE IN FUNDED OR DOES IT START A NEW. WHERE WHERE DOES THE- WHAT HAPPENS WITH ASSUMING THE VOTERS PASS IT YEAH YOU KNOW IT'S A- IT WILL. HOW HOW DO WE PUT I AND INVITED AND APPRECIATE ACTUALLY DID MINISTRATIONS DOING SOME PRIORITIZATION. WHERE DO WE THERE'S A START WITH THE BACKLOG GUARD IS THAT THE BACKLOG OR DOES IT. START WITH THE TIME THE BOND ACTUALLY IS APPROVED BY THE VOTERS WE DO HAVE EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A BACKLOG NOW SO WE START WITH THE BACKLOG. OKAY SO I JUST WANT TO KEEP THAT IN MIND EIGHT HUNDRED BILLION BACKLOG SO THAT MEANS THAT. I DO APPRECIATE THE INCENTIVES I WOULD ALSO. THE PRIORITIZATION I THINK THAT HAVING SOME OF THAT IMPORTANT I ALSO APPRECIATE. THE SOME OF THE CONCERNS ABOUT DEVELOPER FEES ALTHOUGH AGAIN YOU KNOW WE'RE TRYING TO BALANCE OUR HOUSING TO I MEAN WE'RE NOT GONNA HAVE STUDENTS WHO. DON'T HAVE PLACE LET MOST OF WHAT WE DO HAVE STUDENTS HAVE NO PLACE TO LIVE AND THAT'S A PROBLEM. RIGHT AND SO I THINK IT'S PRAISE SOMEONE CONTINGENT ON US AND I APPRECIATE. A SUMMER DOWNEY SAID YOU CAN BE MONITORING THIS REGULARLY AND THINKING ABOUT. WHAT ARE THE SOLUTIONS WE HAVE ASIDE FROM DEVELOPER FEES THAT MAY ACTUALLY DISCOURAGE HOUSING CONSTRUCTION. TO HELP SUPPORT SCHOOL DISTRICTS BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY FIRST OF ALL YOU HAVE STUDENTS WHO ARE LIVING YOU NEED TO EDUCATE THEM SO WE'D BE SURE WE HAVE THERE'S- SO THEY BOTH GO HAND IN HAND I ALSO. WANTS TO SET A SAY THAT DIED I EIGHT SUPPORT YOUR STRONG SUPPORT THE P. L. A. INCENTIVES I THINK YOU KNOW TERMS OF THAT'S WE WANT TO LOOK AT QUALITY CONSTRUCTION AND I KNOW THAT PLA'S OF ACTUALLY GENERATED MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR PEOPLE HERE AND AT LEAST IN MY DISTRICT SO. I JUST I KNOW THAT WAS RAISED BY SOME OPPOSITION ABOUT THAT AND THEN FINALLY I THINK IN TERMS OF THE HIGHER EDUCATION PIECE I THINK I'VE SAID THIS BEFORE IN THE COMMITTEE CERTAINLY VERY SUPPORTIVE OF WHAT'S IN THIS PLAN FOR HIGHER EDUCATION. BUT IN THE SAME IN SOME SENSES WE NEED TO COME OF THE MORE SYSTEMATIC WAY OF ALSO FOUND CUT AND WE'RE SO FAR BEHIND THAT'S WHAT WE DID YOU KNOW WE NEED THIS BECAUSE WE ARE SO FAR BEHIND IN ALL OR THREE SYSTEMS I. YOU KNOW WHAT THAT ARE YOU SEE. AT A CSU AND OF COURSE KEOGH COMMITTEE COLLEGE DISTRICT. SO WHILE CERTAINLY THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT. I THINK WE NEED TO LOOK MORE SYSTEMATICALLY BECAUSE I THINK THE LAST HIGHER EDUCATION BONDS HOW LONG AGO. CENTER LATER. TWO THOUSAND AND SIX OKAY SUCH A LONG TIME AGO SO. WE NEED TO. ALSO TH EVEN THAT AFTER HE PASSED THE SPOT WE NEED TO THINK HOW WE DO THAT MORE SYSTEMATICALLY IN SOME COULD ARGUE ALSO THAT LITTLE BIT OF K. TWELVE PASSED YOU MORE BONDS BUT- THINKING ABOUT. MORE SYSTEMATICALLY FUNDING OUR CAPITAL PROJECTS WITH THAT. I THINK IS NECESSARY VERY MUCH. MANAGER GET CAN I JUST COME IN YOUR MANAGER YES. TO PANIC GOING FORWARD I'D BE HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOUNGER SENATOR GLAZERS WELL. TO LOOK AT OUR HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING MODEL FOR IT FOR THEIR FACILITIES. AND ALSO HOW IT'S APPLIED ACROSS THE SYSTEM AND EVEN ON EACH CAMPUS. I WALK THROUGH CAMPUS JUST ABOUT EVERY DAY. BOBBI STAY WHEN I'M AT HOME WITH THE DOG IN THE MORNING I. C. LE DISPARITY THERE SEE BUILDINGS THAT ARE. BRAND NEW SHINY. AND WHILE THAT DIDN'T SEEM TO ME THAT HAS THE HIGHEST PRIORITY AND THEN OTHERS ARE. IN THE CLASSROOMS AND LOOK THE SAME WAY THEY DID WHEN I WAS THERE THIRTY FIVE. THIRTY YEARS AGO WHATEVER WAS. THIRTY YEARS AGO SO I'M I THINK THAT IS SOMETHING THAT IS WAS WORTHY OF DISCUSSION. MY RESPONSE. THE LAST ADMINISTRATION REALLY BROKE WITH TRADITION. AND RATHER THAN FOCUSING ON THESE TYPES OF CAPITAL BOND SYSTEMATICALLY OVERTIME. OR IN THE OLD DAYS THE OLD COPY FUND. WHICH WAS OIL. REVENUE THEY RELIED UPON INTERNAL BORROWING. THAT WILL. WAS IF IT WAS TO CONTINUE PUT PRESSURE ON TUITION INCREASES AND IT WAS SOMETHING I WAS VERY MUCH OPPOSED TO DURING THAT TIME AND SO WE HAD KIND OF A FREEZE. BUT I THINK YOU'RE YOUR COMMENTS ARE WELL TAKEN AND I WOULD SUPPORT CONTINUING WORK ON THAT AREA. THANK YOU BOTH CENTER DRAWS SO YEAH I'M- THANK YOU FOR ALL YOUR WORK ON THIS AND I THINK THE THINGS THAT YOU'VE IDENTIFIED HERE FOR THE FOR THE USE OF THE OF THE FUNDS IS A REALLY GREAT THINGS THAT HE PROBABLY WOULD NEVER HAVE SEEN IN THE IN THE PAST. BUT THERE'S SO MANY THINGS I WONDER IN HOW DO YOU GIVE GUIDANCE AND FOCUS BECAUSE THERE'S SO MANY THINGS YOU TRYING TO TRYING TO ADDRESS PRESCHOOLS WHICH I THINK IS GREAT WE NOW HAVE WE'RE GONNA HAVE THE NEED FOR MORE SPACE FOR PRESCHOOL WITH SUCH A SUCH A FOCUS THERE. BUT ALSO HEALTH AND SAFETY STUDENT HOUSING ON DISASTER ASSISTANCE THERE'S SO MANY SO MANY THINGS HOW DO YOU REALLY ARE YOU REALLY GET TO THE BOTTOM OF HAVING AN IMPACT WHEN IT SPREAD OUT IN SO MANY DIFFERENT WAYS. WELL FIRST WHAT IS YOUR HAS TO HAVE THE- RIGHT THE PROGRAM IS STILL BASED ON NEED THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT IT'S NOT JUST GET I GET I GET MY SHARE ITS NEED THEY HAVE TO ESTABLISH A TO BE HARD TO WRITE WILL HAVE TO ESTABLISH A NEED AND IT'S VERY TECHNICAL PROCESS. THEY ALSO HAVE TO WANT THE MONEY AND SO THOSE TWO THINGS HAVE TO HAPPEN IN THIS WHOLE PROCESS I WOULD SAY PRETTY EQUITABLE PROCESS SET UP TO THE STATE ALLOCATION BOARD BOARD THAT WE SIT ON THAT THAT THAT DOLES OUT THE MONEY FOR SCHOOLS FROM THE BOND AND ALSO SETS UP THE ASSOCIATE REGULATIONS. TO ENSURE THAT THAT MONEY IS DEL VALLE WISELY FAIRLY. AND AS RAPIDLY AS POSSIBLE. IN IN THE IN THE HIGHER EDUCATION SPACE BILL SYSTEMS HAVE FIVE YEAR CAPITAL PLANS TO TRY TO SET PRIORITIES. TO PUBLIC HEARINGS AND PUBLIC DEBATE. AND THAT PROBABLY WOULD BE THE GUIDANCE THAT THEY WOULD USE GOING FORWARD IF THE BOND IS APPROVED TO. MAKE GOOD CHOICES THAT GOING FORWARD. THE OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. WE HAVE A MOTION. BILLS REMOVED JOHN WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE SAYS FOR AN IPHONE I THINK SENATOR GLAZER AND OTHERS THE ADMINISTRATION FOR WORKING TOGETHER IN A- STAKEHOLDERS TO PUT THIS TOGETHER THANK YOU.
