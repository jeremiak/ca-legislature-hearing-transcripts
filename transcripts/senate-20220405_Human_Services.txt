AND UNFORTUNATELY GROWING NUMBER OF FAMILIES WITH CHILDREN WHO ARE LIVING ON OUR STREETS YOU YOU'RE NOT HAVE HOUSING AND ADDITIONALLY- PREGNANT PEOPLE SO WHAT SB TEN EIGHTY THREE DOES IS EXPEDITE. THEIR ACCESS TO TEMPORARY HOTEL VOUCHERS AND THEN EXTENDS THE TIME THAT SUCH A FAMILY CAN STAY IN THE TEMPORARY HOTEL SO THAT. THEY HAVE ENOUGH TIME WITH THE SOCIAL WORKER WHOEVER'S ASSISTING THEM TO SECURE THAT PERMANENT HOUSING THERE'S A VERY INTERESTING- SERIES- I BELIEVE IT'S- I IT WAS- FUNDED AND SET UP BY PBS. THAT SESAME STREET PRODUCED AND IT'S HEARING FROM KIDS DIRECTLY AND EACH SEGMENT IS ABOUT A KIDS EXPERIENCE A ONE SEGMENT IS KIDS WHO ARE ON CHILDREN OF VETERANS ANOTHER SEGMENT IS KIDS WHO ARE CHILDREN OF INCARCERATED PEOPLE IN ANOTHER SEGMENT IS CHILDREN WHO ARE HOMELESS. AND THE IT'S VERY POWERFUL BUT THE TRAGEDY OF WATCHING IT IS THERE'S MANY ON SCENES WHERE THE KIDS ARE IN THE HOTEL ROOM WHERE THEY HAVE THIS TEMPORARY AND THEY'RE BEING ABLE TO GO TO SCHOOL AND THEY WERE GETTING BACK IN THERE DOING THEIR HOMEWORK BUT THEN THEIR VOUCHER RUNS OUT. AND THEY'RE BACK IN THEIR CAR IN THE NEAR IT MOVE AROUND SO MUCH THAT THEY CAN'T GO TO THE SAME SCHOOL OR THE SOCIAL WORKERS TRYING TO HELP THEM CAN'T FIND SO THIS BILL WOULD ADDRESS THAT AND ALLOW ME GO TO MY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT.

CALIFORNIA HOUSING MARKET NOT IN TODAY'S HOUSING MARKET YOU NEED MORE TIME TO GET ASSISTANCE AND THEN FRANKLY AND THEN FINALLY- THIS BILL ALSO- EXPANDS THE POTENTIAL RESOURCES THAT ARE AVAILABLE- FOR THE PROGRAM ELIMINATES THE ONCE AND- YEAH I YEAR PROHIBITION- ON GETTING- ASSISTANCE FOR THIS AS WE KNOW UNFORTUNATELY SOME FAMILIES HAVE MULTIPLE INCIDENTS OF HOMELESSNESS AND WE NEED TO BE PREPARED TO HELP THEM AT ALL TIMES FOR ALL THESE REASONS WE STRONGLY SUPPORT SB TEN EIGHTY THREE.

RIGHT WELL THANK YOU- SENATOR SKINNER FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD TO IMPROVE THE PROGRAM THAT AFFECTS SOME OF THE MOST VULNERABLE MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITIES PREGNANT AND HOMELESS FAMILIES WITH CHILDREN BEEN WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT TO ADDRESS TECHNICAL AND IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES. AND I WOULD ASK THAT YOU CONTINUE WORKING WITH BOTH THE DEPARTMENT AND THE COUNTIES TO WORK OUT THESE TECHNICAL OUR CONCERNS. ARE DO WE HAVE ANY COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS AT. CENTERPOINT THANK YOU AND US ARE SKINNER REALLY APPRECIATE YOU BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD AND CERTAINLY GREE WITH- WHAT YOU'RE PROPOSING AND THE BILL LIKE IT DID HAVE A QUESTION IN TERMS OF CAPACITY AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT DO YOU HAVE AN ANSWER TO THIS THE- SO CERTAINLY I THINK IT MAKES. SENSE FOR EVERYTHING THAT YOU SAID THAT- TEST FIRE SAID AT TERMS OF HAVING MORE TIME. FOR PEOPLE- BUT I GUESS I'M ALSO WHETHER YOU CAN COMMENT ON BOTH- HOW DO WE HAVE THE SHELTER CAPACITY ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO AND- WE THINKING ABOUT PROVIDING- OUR LOW SUPPORT WE CAN PROVIDE LOCALITIES TO HAVE THAT FILTER TO PASSAGE AND I PEOPLE STAYING LONGER FOR ALL THE GOOD REASONS YOU POINTED OUT. THAT HE NEEDS A LONGER OBVIOUSLY GO WE'VE BEEN WORKING IN THE SENATE- TO. ACTUALLY PROVE OVERALL HOUSING OVER ALSO IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT SHELTERS BUT CLEARLY THAT TERMS OF THIS POPULATION WITH THIS BILL I GET THE MORE PRESSURE ON SHELTER CAPACITY RIGHT TO SINCE WE KNOW THAT PEOPLE STAY LONGER- SO COULD HE MAYBE. WERE THERE CAN YOU PERHAPS ADDRESS THAT IN TERMS OF- IT'S NOT PART OF THE BILL BUT PERHAPS THERE'S OTHER THINGS YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT OR SUCH OTHER CONVERSATIONS ABOUT INSURING THAT- THIS IS A DIGITAL NOW BECOMES LAW THAT WE ACTUALLY HAVE THE SHELTER CAPACITY TO ALLOW PEOPLE TO STAY THAT PERIOD OF TIME- OR WE GET YOU KNOW WITHOUT FORCING OTHER PEOPLE. TO BASICALLY NOT BILL TO GET INTO THE SHELTER. YOU ALSO COULD USE ASSISTANCE. CERTAINLY THROUGH THE CHAIR. YES THANK YOU FROM. SO BILL ABOUT THE SOUTH AND NOT THE SHORTER AND THE IS BE. PART OF THE PART THE PROBLEM WITH THE SHELTER SYSTEM IS THAT LET'S TAKE- YOU'VE GOT FEMALE SOLDIERS MAIL SHELTER SO YOU'RE YOU'RE A FAMILY WITH KIDS AND YOU HAVE A SON THAT'S TWELFTH IN IN- MOTIONAL TO RULES WOULDN'T ALLOW THE TWELVE YEAR OLD MALE TO GO INTO THE WITH FEMALE SHELTER SO THE FAMILY THEN REFUSES TO GO TO SHELTER BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO SEE THEIR CHILDREN SEPARATED. SO THAT'S WHY THIS BILL IS FOCUSED ON VOUCHERS FOR ITS USUALLY IN- THERE ARE SOME PROGRAMS THAT AREN'T HOTEL OR MOTEL THERE'S SOME YOU KNOW TRANSITIONAL HOUSING THAT THE VOUCHERS WOULD BE APPLIED FOR BUT IT'S NOT FOR TRADITIONAL SHELTER. AND AS WE ARE PUTTING MORE MONEY INTO THINGS LIKE PROJECT- ROOM KEY AND SUCH WHILE IT'S CERTAINLY YOU KNOW IT'S NOT CLEAR THAT WILL DO THAT UNLIMITED LEE WE AT THE MOMENT HAVE MORE CAPACITY TO GIVE PEOPLE VOUCHERS FOR LONGER AND THEN YOU KNOW WHAT PART OF MY THINKING AND TRYING TO DO THIS RIGHT NOW IS THAT WE ARE FUNDING VOUCHERS AND WE ARE FINDING PERMANENT HOUSING. AND SO IF WE HAVE A FAMILY IN A IN A IN THE TEMPORARY MAYBE WE WILL CONNECT THEM TO THAT NEW HOUSING QUICKER AND. THEY SHOULD HAVE A PRIORITY FOR IT ANYWAY. NO THANK YOU APPRECIATE THE ANSWER AND CERTAINLY THEY THINK THAT IS THE HOPE RIGHT THAT RADIO. GIVE PEOPLE THE TIME AND YOU MADE THAT- YOU HAVE SAID THAT THE TESTIMONY THAT. SIXTY DAYS MAYBE TOO SHORT TO ACTUALLY MAKE THAT CONNECTION YEAH AND THEN YOU LOSE THE FAMILY ON THE STREETS RIGHT AGAIN INSTEAD OF BEING ABLE TO STILL CONNECT THEM AND GET THEM INTO A PERMIT HOUSING SOLUTIONS. RIGHT THANK YOU AND I'D LIKE TO MOVE TO BUILD APPROPRIATE TIME. THANK YOU I HAVE IF YOU HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. NO OKAY SO WE HAVE A MOTION TO MOVE THE BILL CENTERS CAN WHICH LIKE TO CLOSE THANK YOU SO MUCH- MANAGER AND YES I WILL ABSOLUTELY COMMIT TO CONTINUING TO WORK WE WANT THIS TO WORK AND WE KNOW. I'VE ALREADY HAD THE EXPERIENCE WHERE YOU KNOW OUT GOOD BILLS WERE PASSED THAT DIDN'T REALLY GET IMPLEMENTED IN THE WAY INTENDED BECAUSE THERE WASN'T CAPACITY OR THERE WERE OBSTACLES THAT THE DEPARTMENT'S. HUNT MAYBE THEY HADN'T IDENTIFIED IN ADVANCE BUT WE HADN'T WORKED CLEAR ENOUGH TO SEE SO. THAT WITH THAT EXPERIENCE I DEFINITELY WANT TO HAVE THE DEPARTMENT'S HELP US IDENTIFY WHAT OBSTACLES OR THE COUNTIES. SO THAT WE CAN TWEAK IT BECAUSE WE WANT TO WORK THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS AND WITH THAT I ASTRONOMICAL THANK YOU. I SO HAVE A MOTION ON SB TEN EIGHTY THREE- BY SENATOR HAND THE MOTION IS TO PASS THE FIRST RE RE REFER TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS CONSULTING HE PLEASE CALL THE ROLL.

RIGHT THANK YOU CENTER BATES YOU'RE YOU'RE UP TO PUT. YEAH COME ON UP. SLOCUM CENTER BAY TO MAKE ISN'T YOUR BILL S. B. THIRTEEN FORTY TWO. SO THIS IS SB THIRTEEN FORTY TWO A GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR HER TADO AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS I AM VERY PLEASED TO PRESENT S. B. R. THIRTEEN FORTY TWO WHICH WOULD AUTHORIZE COUNTIES TO CREATE MULTI DISCIPLINARY TEAMS FOR OLDER ADULTS. ADULTS ARE TO BEGIN IT'S REALLY WANT TO THANK YOU AND THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR ALL OF THE WORK THEY HAVE PUT INTO MAKING THIS BILL WORK THE FASTEST GROWING DEMOGRAPHICS IN CALIFORNIA IS OLDER ADULTS. BY TWENTY THIRTY ONE QUARTER OF CALIFORNIA'S POPULATION WILL BE SIXTY OR OLDER. A RECENT SCANNED FOUNDATION POLL REPORTED THAT NEARLY 40% OF CALIFORNIANS OVER THE AGE OF SIXTY FOUR WHO LIVE INDEPENDENTLY STATED THEY NEED HELP WITH THEIR DAILY ACTIVITIES SUCH AS RUNNING ERRANDS BEATING DRESSING ANNUAL PREPARATION. HOWEVER AGING SERVICES ARE FRACTURED BY AN ARBITRARY DIVISION OF EXPERTISE IN PROGRAMS CERTAINLY KIND OF LIKE PROGRAM SILOS ON THE ONE HAND THIS ALLOWS FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF QUALITY SERVICES AND SKILLED STAFF BUT ON THE OTHER IT CREATES GAPS IN INEFFICIENCIES THAT CAN ONLY BE RESOLVED WITH THESE AGENCIES ARE ALLOWED TO WORK TOGETHER. BY AUTHORIZING COUNTIES TO CREATE A MULTI DISCIPLINARY TEAM FOR OLDER ADULTS AGING SERVICE PROVIDER AGENCIES CAN SHARE INFORMATION TO HOLISTICALLY ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF THIS SEGMENT OF THE POPULATION. THEY WILL ALSO BE ABLE TO DEVELOP COORDINATED CASE PLANS IMPROVE SERVICE DELIVERY AND PROVIDE SUPPORT TO CAREGIVERS THE CURRENT SYSTEM DOES NOT ALLOW FOR THE COORDINATION OF SERVICES AMONG AGING SERVICE PROVIDER AGENCIES DUE TO LEGAL CONSTRAINTS. ON THE SHARING OF INFORMATION THE RESULT IS OLDER ADULTS ARE SUBJECTED TO LENGTHY AND OFTEN REDUNDANT INTAKE PROCESS SEES THAT REQUIRE THEM TO REPEAT THEIR STORY TO EACH NEW PROVIDER FULLY CAPABLE OF ADVOCATING FOR THEMSELVES SB THIRTEEN FORTY TO SEEK TO SUPPORT THOSE WHO NEED ASSISTANCE NAVIGATING THE COMPLEX NETWORK. OF SERVICES AVAILABLE IN THEIR AREA IT BRINGS THE EXPERTS AND PROGRAMS TOGETHER TO BETTER SERVE OUR AGING ADULT POPULATION IN THE CARE GIVERS WHO OVERSEE THEM. THE MEASURE WOULD REPLACE A LONG STANDING REACTIVE APPROACH TO OLDER ADULT CARE COORDINATION WITH THE NEW PROACTIVE ONE OFFERING COMPREHENSIVE AND COLLABORATIVE STRATEGIES TO DELIVER AGING SERVICES THE BILL IS SPONSORED. BY THE COUNTY OF ORANGE AND SUPPORTED BY C. SACK CW L. C. W. D. A. AND A NUMBER OF NONPROFITS THIS EFFORT IS BEING LED BY THE PEOPLE ON THE GROUND. DOING THIS MOST IMPORTANT WORK AND I'M HONORED TO BE THE AUTHOR HERE TO TESTIFY ON BEHALF. OF THE BILL OUR DEBORAH BATES NO RELATIONSHIP. ORANGE COUNTY SOCIAL SERVICE AGENCY DIRECTOR IN HOLLY HAGLER CEO FOR MEALS ON WHEELS ORANGE COUNTY. GOOD AFTERNOON SHARE HER CALDERON COMMITTEE MEMBERS I'VE NEVER BATES DIRECTOR OF ACCOUNTING A BORN SOCIAL SERVICES AGENCY. MANY LOCAL JURISDICTIONS INCLUDING ORANGE COUNTY YOU'RE WORKING ON AFFECTING THEIR CURRENT AGING SERVICES IN SUPPORT OF THE MASTER PLAN FOR AGING. ARE THE RESULT OF THIS WORK WE HAVE RECOGNIZED THE NEED TO DEVELOP MORE COMPREHENSIVE AND INTEGRATED CASE MANAGEMENT MODEL. TO HOLISTICALLY MEET THE UNIQUE NEEDS OF THOSE WE SERVE OUR DESIRES TO PROVIDE SERVICES THAT ARE BOTH PERSON CENTERED AND SIMPLIFY ACCESS TO COORDINATED RESPONSES. ARE FREE FOR CUSTOMER EVALUATION PROCESS THE CAPTAIN COUNTING. BARRIERS TO CARE FOR NATION. THE CLEAR THE FOR TO THE END OF BILL FOR THE- THAT PROVIDE CRITICAL SUPPORT. FROM SHARING INFORMATION WITH EACH OTHER. I THINK FOR EXAMPLE A SITUATION IN WHICH WE HAVE AN INDIVIDUAL SEVENTY EIGHT YEARS OF AGE WITH MULTIPLE SERVICING. SHE LIVES ON A SMALL MONTHLY RETIREMENT BENEFIT 5% STRUGGLING TO MEET THEIR BASIC NEEDS EACH MONTH. THAT YOU'RE PAYING HER RIGHT PURCHASING FOOD FOR DECLINING HEALTH HAS CREATED ADDITIONAL CHALLENGES WITH MAINTAINING A HEALTHFUL AND OTHER CRITICAL DAILY ACTIVITIES. TODAY SHE WOULD NEED TO SEEK SERVICES FROM UP TO FIVE DIFFERENT PROGRAMS INTO PROVIDERS. INTERACTION WITH THE SERVICE PROVIDERS WOULD REQUIRE SOMEONE WHO IS ALREADY STRUGGLING TO COMMUNICATE WITH MULTIPLE STAFF MEMBERS AND SOCIAL WORKERS HAVE BEEN VARIOUS ORGANIZATIONS REQUIRED THEM TO NAVIGATE THROUGH A MULTITUDE ABOUT THE PORTAL. AND DIFFERENT ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS. ACCORDING SB THIRTEEN TWO CREATE AN ART. FOR US TO BEGIN ADDRESSING THE FRAGMENTED SUPPORT SYSTEM THAT CURRENTLY EXIST AND I'LL ALLOW FROM LEVEL OF FLEXIBILITY NEEDED FOR US TO IMPLEMENT INTEGRATED SERVICES MODEL FOR BETTER SUPPORT THE UNIQUE NEEDS OF THIS POPULATION- IT AFFORDED AN OPPORTUNITY DEVELOP INTEGRATED ASSESSMENT OF NEED. A COMPREHENSIVE AND INDIVIDUALIZED CASE PLANS. FIFTY THIS BILL WITH THE PORT OF THING CARING FOR AGING POPULATION OF COOKIE SEMANA WITHOUT REQUIRING THEM TO GO TO EACH INDIVIDUAL ACCESS POINT EACH TIME THEY NEED A SERVICE. ESPECIALLY FOR THOSE WITH MULTIPLE AND COMPLEX NEEDS. AND ALLOW FOR THE CREATION OF MULTI DISCIPLINARY TEAMS VETERAN GROUP BOTH GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES AS WELL COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS. MEMBERS OF THE MPC WOULD HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF MAINTAINING PRIVACY AND WILL BE REQUIRED TO SIGN A MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING IN ORDER TO PARTICIPATE. BMO YOU WOULD MAKE IT VERY CLEAR THAT PRIVACY IS PARAMOUNT. FINALLY WE WILL BE WORKING WITH THE SENATE JUDICIARY CONSULTANTS ON LANGUAGE AROUND CONSENT. FOR INFORMATION SHARING AND URGE YOUR SUPPORT OF THIS IMPORTANT. MEASURE THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND A WILL BE MY ON TO WITNESS WERE TO. GOOD MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS I AM HOLLY HAIGLER CEO OF MEALS ON WHEELS ORANGE COUNTY I AM ALSO ON THE BOARDS OF DIRECTORS FOR MEALS ON WHEELS CALIFORNIA AND FOR MEALS ON WHEELS AMERICA. MEALS ON WHEELS ORANGE COUNTY DELIVERS A MILLION MEALS ANNUALLY TO AT RISK OLDER ADULTS PROVIDE SOCIAL SERVICES SUCH AS ADULT DAY CARE CASE MANAGEMENT CARE COORDINATION AND OTHER PROGRAMS DESIGNED TO HELP OLDER ADULTS REMAIN SAFE IN THEIR HOMES. AND THE COMMUNITY THEY LIVE. AT MEALS ON WHEELS- SEE WE PARTNER WITH THE COUNTY AND MUNICIPALITIES AS WELL AS SENIOR HOUSING MANAGED CARE HEALTH PLANS HOSPITALS AND OTHER ORGANIZATIONS SIR VULNERABLE OLDER ADULTS. AND PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR CAREGIVERS WHO NEED A CONSISTENT AND ONGOING PLAN OF CARE. IN MY EXPERIENCE OLDER ADULTS UTILIZING THE SERVICES OF MEALS ON WHEELS THOSE BE COULD ALSO BENEFIT FROM ADDITIONAL CARE IN OTHER AREAS OF THEIR LIVES. SERVICES SUCH AS HOUSING TRANSPORTATION LEGAL ADVICE AND OTHER ACTIVITIES OF DAILY LIVING BECOME MORE CHALLENGING AS WE AGE. REQUIRING A NEW INTRODUCTION DETERMINATION OF NEED AND SEPARATE CASE PLAN FOR EACH AND EVERY SERVICE PROVIDED IS AN UNNECESSARY BARRIER TO CARE. WE RECOGNIZE THAT VARIOUS SERVICES REQUIRE STRONG COORDINATION BY THOSE WHO PROVIDE THE CRITICAL PROGRAM THAT OLDER ADULTS RELY ON FOR THEIR SAFETY INDEPENDENCE AND WELLBEING. SB THIRTEEN FORTY TWO WILL SUPPORT THE MASTER PLAN FOR AGING EMPHASIS ON PROVIDING PERSON CENTRED SERVICES AND IMPROVED ACCESS. IT WILL HELP OLDER ADULTS IN NEED OF ADDITIONAL ASSISTANCE RECEIVE A MULTITUDE OF COORDINATED SUPPORT IN A STREAMLINED MANNER WHILE ALSO PRESERVING THEIR PRIVACY. THANK YOU.

WANT TO THANK YOU FOR AND APPRECIATE YOUR FOCUS ON PROVIDING MORE INTEGRATED COORDINATED CARE TO OUR OLDER ADULTS IN CALIFORNIA- BEATS AND- AS MENTIONED IN THE ANALYSIS- IT IS IMPORTANT WE HAVE ÁP. BALANCE BALANCES WILL MORE COORDINATED SERVICES WITH THE NEED TO IMPLEMENT INDIVIDUAL BOB HALL THERE ARE CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION MAY BE SHARED AND OBTAIN THEIR CONSENT TO THAT INFORMATION SHARING UNDERSTAND WILL BE WORKING ON THAT EXACT LANGUAGE IN THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE. THANK YOU FOR WORKING WITH US- DO ANY MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS COMMENTS VIA CENTER PANDION THE CALM WATER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND SIR BATES I CERTAINLY APPRECIATE- WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE WITH THIS BILL AND- TO ALLOW BASICALLY DIFFERENT AGENCIES WORK TOGETHER THROUGH THIS MULTI DISCIPLINARY TEAM. I THINK WAS BECAUSE THIS WAS NOTED IN THE ANALYSIS ABOUT PRIVACY ISSUES OF COURSE WERE DEALING WITH SENIORS WHO ARE ADULTS AND- AND- I'M SURE WE PROTECT OUR PRIVACY SO I KNOW YOU'LL BE ADDRESSING SOME HILL MADE HIS ISSUES AND YOU DO SHERRY BUT- I DID WANT IT SIR. MAYBE ASK QUESTIONS REGARDING THE PRIVACY ISSUES- SO- IN TERMS OF- THE PRIVACY RULES WHICH- AT LEAST YOUR INTENT- WITH THIS I MEAN. SO THE MULTI DISPLAY TEAM GETS GETS TOGETHER- I GUESS WOULD THIS BE ON A- YES NEED TO KNOW BASIS AND OTHERS I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE ARE PARTICULARLY TO THE PERSON BEING SERVED EXACTLY WHO'S- GOING TO YOU KNOW. UNDER WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES THEIR PERSONAL INFORMATION MAY BE SHARED WHAT TYPE OF INFORMATION RIGHT SO- AND I START THINKING ABOUT MY YEAH MYSPACE'S PRIVACY IS A HEALTH PROFESSIONAL. SO SOMEONE MAY SIGN A DEAL WAVERED IT SAYS OF COURSE YOU KNOW- FOR PRIVACY AND WE GET HIT BY AND SO FORTH BUT A LATE WITHIN THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM BUT EVEN WITHIN THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM IF YOU'RE NOT INVOLVED IN ACTUAL PATIENT CARE OF THE PATIENT YOU SHOULD BE GETTING. THEIR HEALTH INFORMATION RIGHT BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT ACTUALLY PARTLY INVOLVED EVEN THOUGH YOU MAY BE WORKING IN THE HOSPITAL AND SO FORTH. SO I DON'T KNOW WHETHER TO THEIR THOUGHTS IN TERMS OF. FOR THE AND THE T. THAT. HOW YOU INSURED- WHAT YOU THINK MAYBE THE- THE BOUNDARIES FOR SHARING OF INFORMATION WITHIN THE M. D. T. TO PREVENT- I GUESS- VENTURING OF INFORMATION PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY AREN'T INVOLVED IN PROVIDING SERVICES RIGHT AND I REALIZE THAT SOME OF IT MAYBE ALSO BECAUSE- YOU'RE EXPLORING WHETHER THEY NEED A SERVICE SO. MAYBE THEY'RE NOT RECEIVING SERVICE YET BUT- BUT BASICALLY LIMITED AND I GUESS YOU COULD SAY NEED TO NOTATE BASIS AND- I'M SURE THE DISTRICT MAYBE CAN HELP WORK OUT THE LANGUAGE FOR HOW HOW YOU WOULD ACTUALLY BUT THEN THE CODE. BUT THE BUT AT AND I KNOW YOU SO I HAVE EXPERIENCE AS A SOCIAL WORKER AND SOME OF THESE ISSUES WELL BUT MAYBE YOU CAN TRY TO ADDRESS SOME OF THAT TO BE HELPFUL. FOR ME I THINK IT'S PROBABLY THE OUR DOCTOR PAN SENATOR PAM. BUT IT GOES TO THE INTAKE PROCESS ITSELF AND IT USUALLY HAVING BEEN I A DID A GREAT DEAL ABOUT WHEN I WAS SOCIAL WORKER. THERE ARE FORMS THAT ARE FILLED OUT SO IT WOULD BE THEY'LL MAKE GIVING CONSENT. BUT I DO BELIEVE THAT THE FORM THAT THEY'RE GOING TO FILL OUT WHICH WOULD BE MULTI OVER THE THREE DISCIPLINES THAT. THEY WOULD HAVE TO HAVE A VERY IN DEPTH CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT IT MEANT IF THEY WERE CONSENTING AND IN PARTICULAR IT IS ALL ABOUT THE HEALTH ISSUES THE PRIVACY THAT. HAVE TO DO WITH WHAT PROJECTS HIPPA SO I WOULD SEE A FORM THAT ACTUALLY. I HAD ABOUT CONSENT ON IT AND THEN EXPLAINING WHAT THAT. MEANT TO THE INDIVIDUAL WHICH HOUSING INTAKE SO WORKER YOU DO. SPEND A LOT OF TIME. ON THE FACE TO FACE. WHEN YOU'RE DO. IT ONLINE. I WOULD SAY THAT. COULD BE PART PROBLEMATIC IF IT'S NOT DONE FACE TO FACE. WE HAVEN'T REALLY CONFRONTED THAT QUESTION BUT I THINK THAT SOMETHING THAT. IN TERMS OF THIS WHOLE DISCUSSION ABOUT THE PRIVACY NEEDS TO COME UP. GOT A FORM AND YOU'RE GOING OVER IT WITH YOUR CLIENT. AND WHAT IT MEANS THAT EACH ONE OF THE AREAS THAT YOU'RE PROVIDING INFORMATION. I SEE THE HEALTH ISSUES HAVE A LOT TO DO WITH NUTRITION OKAY. AND WHETHER AND THE MEDICATIONS THAT ARE BEING. GIVEN AND TAKEN. IT WOULD BE THE I THINK THAT. THE CONSENT OF THE INDIVIDUAL TO SAY. I HAVE A HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE PROBLEM THAT I'M TAKING THIS. AND IF THEY DON'T WISH TO DISCUSS THAT BUT THAT HAS A LOT TO DO WITH NUTRITION. THEN THAT'S SOMETHING THAT IS LEFT WITH THE CLIENT THE INDIVIDUAL. IF THEY WANT TO REVEAL THAT. BUT IT SEEMS TO ME IF YOU'RE GOING TO EACH ONE OF THESE INDIVIDUALLY. THESE PROGRAMS YOU HAVE THAT SAME ISSUE. IDEA BECAUSE WHAT I WOULD DO IS AN INTAKE SUPERVISOR. WE WOULD INTERVIEW THE PERSON. THEY NEEDED X. Y. NZ WE'D HAVE TO SEND THEM TO ALL THOSE DIFFERENT. AGENCIES TO GET THAT HELP. AND THEY WERE GOING THROUGH THE SAME INTERVIEW PROCESS THE SAME CONSENT. SO THIS IS PUTTING IT ALL WITH ONE INDIVIDUAL WHO'S GOING TO DO THE INTERVIEW AND I'M ASSUMING. THAT THAT TRIAGE WOULD COME WHEN THE PERSON APPLIES. FOR SOME SORT OF ASSISTANCE. THE OPRAH APPRECIATE ANSWER I THINK- AND I AGREE WITH YOU THAT WE WANT TO MAKE SOMEONE HAVE TO PHYSICALLY GO. ANSWER THE SAME QUESTIONS OVER AND OVER AGAIN FOR EACH DIFFERENT PROGRAM AND THAT'S PROBABLY WHAT THE MDT WILL HELP ADDRESS. I THINK THE PART THAT. PERHAPS COULD USE A CLARIFICATION RIGHT BECAUSE AT LEAST BUT THAT'S LIKE. WHEN YOU WENT EACH PROGRAM YOU KNEW THAT THAT PROGRAM TO GET THE INFORMATION YOU CAN AND YOU MIGHT DECIDE REFUSE THE ANSWER FOR ONE PROGRAMS YOU THINK WASN'T RELEVANT TO THEM THAN THE OTHER SO NOW YOU HAVE ONE AND TWO. SO I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THEY KNOW THAT OKAY IF I DO THE ONE INTAKE EXACTLY WHO'S GOING TO GO TO. AND ALSO THAT. AND I'M- AND AGAIN NOT TRYING TO PUT THE ENTIRE BURDEN ON THE PERSON RECEIVING THE SERVICES THAT THERE WILL BE A BEST JUDGMENT THAT. INFORMATION THAT IS NECESSARY TO BE SHARED THAT THEY MAY HAVE GIVEN ON THE INTAKE. WOULD NOT TO BE SHARED WITH AGENCIES WERE THAT WOULD BE RELEVANT TO THEM RIGHT SO THAT WE WOULD DO AN INTAKE. YOU'D BE GATHERING THIS INFORMATION BUT ONLY THE- INFORMATION THAT'S NECESSARY. FOR THE OTHER AGENCIES WHO MAY BE PART OF ME IN THE M. B. T. IT'S ADDRESS SO THAT WE CAN GET THEM THE WHOLE. SET OF SERVICES THAT ONLY THE ONES THAT WERE PARTICULARLY RELEVANT ARE NECESSARY FOR THAT-AGENCY TO HAVE WOULD BE SURE TO NOT MISS OF THE ENTIRE INTAKE WHICH MAY BE MORE COMPREHENSIVE. IN ORDER TO TRY TO COVER ALL THE DIFFERENT BASES. SELL SELL LEADS SO HOPEFULLY IS YOUR JUDICIARY. THAT THAT CAN BE SORTED OUT BUT THAT IS THAT. IS WHAT I'M SAYING MAKE IT. ARE YOU AGREEMENT DOES THAT MAKE SENSE YES YES OKAY ALL RIGHT I'M COMING IN FOR LET'S SAY HELP. WITH CLUB. YOU KNOW HOUSEKEEPING ON THE SERVICES I NEED BECAUSE I'M NOT ABLE TO. PARTICIPATE COMPLETELY AN AVERAGE. EVERYDAY OUT DAILY ACTIVITIES WILL THEY DON'T NEED TO KNOW. HOW MUCH MONEY OF THE BANK. YOU KNOW RIGHT FINANCIAL LITERACY GOES ALONG WITH THIS TOO WHICH IS ALWAYS BEEN A PROBLEM IN DOING INTAKE ARE THEY ELIGIBLE ACTUALLY. RIGHT SO. YES WE WOULD CERTAINLY ADDRESS THAT BECAUSE I AGREE TOTALLY. NOT NOT WHEN I THINK THAT I SIGNED IN IN MY EXPERIENCE- THERE'S SUCH A DESPERATE NEED. THEY'RE WILLING TO SAY ANYTHING ANY REAL WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE A- ON THE RED. THAT SHOULDN'T BE PART OF PART. SERVICE THAT THEY NEED AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE TO CREATE A FIVE. OF SOME SORT. OKAY NOT THAT THAT THAT'S VERY HELPFUL BECAUSE IT COULD BE AS YOU ACTUALLY GAVE A FAIRLY AND- INTAKE BECAUSE MAYBE THERE'S SOMETHING THAT YOU NEED THAT YOU HAVE SHARE FINANCIAL DATA BUT THERE MAY BE ANOTHER SERVICE THAT BE HELPFUL TO YOU. THAT DOESN'T NEED TO KNOW THAT. JUST BECAUSE HE GAVE ON INTAKE THEY DON'T. THEY DON'T NEED TO KNOW THAT RIGHT THEY JUST NEED TO KNOW THE STUFF THEY NEED TO KNOW. THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATE CENTER A THINK THEY NEED TO KNOW IT'S A GREAT. IT'S A GREAT. CUT COVER IT ALL DON'T YOU. WHAT WOULD YOU REALLY NEED TO KNOW. OKAY RIGHT. WELL THANK YOU AND I'M HAPPY TO MOVE THE BILL TO PROCEED I THINK YOU. THANK YOU SIR PAN AM CENTER COMMON PURCHASE OF QUESTION FROM YOU GUYS. AT THE RISK OF SOUNDING REDUNDANT VERY- HAPPY TO KNOW AS IT WAS IN THE ANALYSIS THAT THE LANGUAGE AROUND CONSENT IS GOING TO BE HASHED OUT IN- JUDICIARY. I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU BUT DURING COLD IT I HAPPEN TO WATCH THAT MOVIE I CARE A LOT. AND IT'S- INTENSE IN TERMS OF HOW THE ELDERLY FOLKS AT CAN BE AND ARE ROUTINELY TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF. YEAH A LOT OF IT HAS TO DO WITH- THEIR INFORMATION AND HOW IT IS SHARED AND SO- JUST ALSO HOPING THAT THERE'S CONTINUED DISCUSSION AND THOUGHT AROUND CHECKS AND BALANCES BECAUSE I DO THINK THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT. THE CLIENT NEEDS. AND THEN WHAT PEOPLE THINK THE CLIENT NEEDS AND OFTEN TIMES WE PUT A LOT IN THAT LATTER BUCKET BECAUSE SOMEONE IS ELDERLY BECAUSE MAYBE THEY SEEM FORGETFUL OR BE YOU KNOW BECAUSE LIKE YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU NEED- YOU KNOW I. MOTHER SAYS THAT A LOT. WHEN I'M TALKING TO HER- AND THE REALITY IS THAT MANY ELDERLY FOLKS DO NOT WHAT THEY NEED AND THEY DO KNOW WHAT THEY WANT AND SO HOW DO WE- MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S A FRAMEWORK IN PLACE. THAT DOESN'T TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THEM THAT DOESN'T DISMISS OR MARGINALIZE THE THINGS THAT THEY BELIEVE ARE IMPORTANT FOR THEM- BECAUSE THE OTHER PART THAT WE KNOW. IS THAT THERE'S A LOT OF MONEY TO BE MADE OFF THE BACKS OF THE ELDERLY- AND SO ALSO HOW DO WE CREATE A FRAMEWORK THAT ALSO IS VERY HONEST ABOUT THAT BECAUSE OFTEN TIMES PEOPLE MAY. SUGGEST ADDITIONAL RESOURCES- BECAUSE REIMBURSEMENT RATES ARE YOU JUST BECAUSE THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE MONEY OFF THE BACKS OF THE SENIOR AND SO. THAT CAN ALSO COMPLICATE THINGS SO HOPING THAT SOME OF THAT IS ALSO INFUSED IN SOME OF THE DISCUSSIONS THAT HAPPEN- ENGINEERS. AND I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL OKAY THANK YOU. ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS WITH MEMBERS THREE NINE OKAY. OUR CENTER BATES ARE WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. WITH YOU THANK YOU FOR THE SUB. VERY ROBUST DEBATE I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT. ISSUE THAT'S BEEN BROUGHT UP BECAUSE SOMETIMES SENIORS STARTED TO GIVE TOO MUCH INFORMATION THAT THEY DON'T NEED TO GO. INTO THAT CAN OPEN THE DOOR TO OF PRIVACY BREACHES AND ALSO. I TAKING ADVANTAGE SO WE WILL MAKE SURE AS WE GET TO JUDICIARY THAT. WE ARE VERY CAREFUL AND ENSURE THAT WE DO HAVE THOSE FIREWALLS AND HAVE IT CONTAINED ISSUE ALL UP YOU KNOW HAVE INDICATED AND I'M CERTAINLY AND OUT.

R. EIGHT BY CENTER COME AGAIN- AND- JUST FEEL FREE TO PRESENT YOUR BILL WHEN YOU ARE READY. GOOD AFTERNOON. MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT S. J. R. EIGHT WHICH CALLS ON CONGRESS TO EXPAND THE SOCIAL SECURITY DISABILITY INSURANCE PROGRAM TO ALLOW CHILDHOOD DISABILITY RECIPIENTS THE RIGHT TO MARRY WHOMEVER THEY CHOOSE WITHOUT THE THREAT OF TERMINATION TO THE BENEFITS SOCIAL SECURITY IS THE MOST EXTENSIVE SAFETY NET PROGRAM AND UNITED STATES WERE EXPENSIVE HEALTH INSURANCE CAN BE AND AFFORDABLE FOR MANY. DISABILITY HEALTH BENEFITS OFFER COMPREHENSIVE SUPPORT FOR SEVERE CHRONIC ILLNESSES AND DISABILITIES AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO EXPENSIVE COMMERCIAL COVERAGE ROUND SIXTY FIVE MILLION ELIGIBLE WORKING AMERICANS AND THEIR FAMILIES DEPEND ON THE SOCIAL SECURITY DISABILITY INSURANCE PROGRAM FOR MONTHLY LIFESAVING BENEFITS THIS PROGRAM IS A LIFELINE FOR MANY SOME DRAW SOCIAL SECURITY AS THE AGE WHILE OTHERS HAVE RELIED ON LIFESAVING SUPPORT. SINCE BIRTH. USE YOUR DISABLED BEFORE THE AGE OF TWENTY TO QUALIFY FOR BENEFITS THROUGH A PARENT'S EARNINGS AND ARE KNOWN AS CHILDHOOD DISABILITY RECIPIENTS UNFORTUNATELY INEQUITIES WITHIN THE PROGRAM PENALIZE CHILDHOOD DISABILITY RECIPIENTS WHO PURSUE A LEGAL MARRIAGE WITH A NON DISABLED PARTNER. CHILDHOOD DISABILITY RECIPIENTS FACE THE THREAT OF TERMINATION OR SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION TO THE BENEFITS IF THEY MARRY A PERSON WHO IS NOT DISABLED. THOSE WHO RELY ON BENEFITS FOR INCOME SUPPORT OR HEALTH COVERAGE MUST DECIDE BETWEEN CONTINUED LIFESAVING ASSISTANCE OR MARRYING THEIR SIGNIFICANT OTHER. THIS ONE THE SYSTEM HAS DISCOURAGED DISABLED PEOPLE FROM MARRYING THE LOVE OF THEIR LIFE. EVERY CITIZEN IS GUARANTEED THE RIGHT TO MARRY WHOM THEY CHOOSE HOWEVER MARRIAGE PRESENTS A FINANCIAL BARRIER FAR TOO STEEP FOR A SIGNIFICANT POPULATION OF DISABLED AMERICANS IF IT CAUSES THE BENEFITS TO CEASE. CONGRESS MUST AMEND THE CURRENT DISCRIMINATORY STRUCTURE OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY DISABILITY INSURANCE PROGRAM. TO GUARANTEE CHILDHOOD DISABILITY RECIPIENTS THE RIGHT TO MARRY WHOMEVER THEY CHOOSE AND RETAIN THE LIFESAVING BENEFITS THEY HAVE HAD THROUGHOUT THEIR ENTIRE LIFE.
