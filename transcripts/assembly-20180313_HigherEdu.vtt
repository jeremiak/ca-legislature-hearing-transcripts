00:46:13.904 --> 00:46:17.174 region:rollup2
THE BUDGET ISSUES UP BUT NOT

00:46:15.373 --> 00:46:19.043 region:rollup2
HERE I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THE

00:46:17.174 --> 00:46:21.812 region:rollup2
STUDENTS ARE AFFORDABILITY

00:46:19.043 --> 00:46:23.581 region:rollup2
ATTENDING THE UNIVERSITY. S. ARE

00:46:21.812 --> 00:46:27.585 region:rollup2
NOT NOW OVER CHARGED A THOUSAND

00:46:23.581 --> 00:46:28.185 region:rollup2
DOLLARS TO TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS

00:46:27.585 --> 00:46:28.386 region:rollup2
TO MAY MAKE A DIFFERENCE SO TO

00:46:28.185 --> 00:46:29.687 region:rollup2
THEM.

00:46:28.386 --> 00:46:30.254 region:rollup2
SO WE ARE MORE CONCERNED ABOUT

00:46:29.687 --> 00:46:31.656 region:rollup2
THE NUTRITION THAT I USE A

00:46:30.254 --> 00:46:33.090 region:rollup2
HOWEVER.

00:46:31.656 --> 00:46:34.692 region:rollup2
A IT IS AN OPTION IF THEY ARE

00:46:33.090 --> 00:46:36.794 region:rollup2
CONCERNED THAT IF THEY CAN GET

00:46:34.692 --> 00:46:38.462 region:rollup2
THOSE SCHOLARSHIPS ARE. YOU KNOW

00:46:36.794 --> 00:46:40.164 region:rollup2
ALONE SO BY ALL MEANS SO FOR

00:46:38.462 --> 00:46:41.732 region:rollup2
THEM TO BUY THEIR MADE PLANS ON

00:46:40.164 --> 00:46:44.135 region:rollup2
KNOWING THAT THE HOW MUCH EXTRA

00:46:41.732 --> 00:46:46.370 region:rollup2
COSTA. A IT IT WILL COST THEM TO

00:46:44.135 --> 00:46:48.239 region:rollup2
BUY PUMP CAMPUS PROVIDED MALES

00:46:46.370 --> 00:46:50.274 region:rollup2
YEAH I THINK THE I APPLAUD THE

00:46:48.239 --> 00:46:51.542 region:rollup2
EFFORT TO BE STUDENT CENTRIC SO

00:46:50.274 --> 00:46:52.877 region:rollup2
THAT THEY CAN DECIDE WHAT TO DO

00:46:51.542 --> 00:46:54.712 region:rollup2
I HOPE THAT AND CERTAINLY

00:46:52.877 --> 00:46:55.746 region:rollup2
ENCOURAGE IT. THIS INTERACTING

00:46:54.712 --> 00:46:57.915 region:rollup2
AND VISITING WITH THE.

00:46:55.746 --> 00:46:59.650 region:rollup2
INDEPENDENT COLLEGES THAT HAVE

00:46:57.915 --> 00:47:01.986 region:rollup2
EXPRESSED A CONCERN ABOUT THIS.

00:46:59.650 --> 00:47:04.822 region:rollup2
AS I SHARE IT AND I HOPE TO BE

00:47:01.986 --> 00:47:05.423 region:rollup2
A CHANCE TO FIND AN OPPORTUNITY

00:47:04.822 --> 00:47:05.690 region:rollup2
TO WORK TOGETHER WITH THEM ON

00:47:05.423 --> 00:47:06.457 region:rollup2
THAT ONE.

00:47:05.690 --> 00:47:09.460 region:rollup2
THANK YOU THANK YOU.

I IS THERE SOMEONE WHO I IS FROM

00:47:10.761 --> 00:47:15.366 region:rollup2
I GUESS THE CSU OUR I MAYBE THAT

00:47:13.864 --> 00:47:16.400 region:rollup2
THE INDEPENDENT SCHOOLS TO THAT

00:47:15.366 --> 00:47:17.168 region:rollup2
THAT COULD ANSWER QUESTIONS I

00:47:16.400 --> 00:47:18.069 region:rollup2
DON'T.

00:47:17.168 --> 00:47:23.808 region:rollup2
DON'T SEE ANYONE.

00:47:18.069 --> 00:47:25.076 region:rollup2
STILL UP HERE.

00:47:23.808 --> 00:47:26.243 region:rollup2
THANK YOU I I JUST WANT TO

00:47:25.076 --> 00:47:28.646 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND THE ECONOMY OF SCALE

00:47:26.243 --> 00:47:30.314 region:rollup2
OR EVEN A LITTLE BETTER SO I AM.

00:47:28.646 --> 00:47:32.383 region:rollup2
I MEAN YOU KNOW I AT WHAT POINT

00:47:30.314 --> 00:47:33.984 region:rollup2
DID TO OPT OUT START TO ACTUALLY

00:47:32.383 --> 00:47:35.720 region:rollup2
HAVE AN APPRECIABLE IMPACT ON

00:47:33.984 --> 00:47:36.854 region:rollup2
COSTS AYE AND HOW HOW MUCH HOW

00:47:35.720 --> 00:47:40.958 region:rollup2
BIG WILL THE IMPACT BE.

00:47:36.854 --> 00:47:42.727 region:rollup2
AT SARAH.

00:47:40.958 --> 00:47:44.528 region:rollup2
SEWER EIGHT. FOR THE INDEPENDENT

00:47:42.727 --> 00:47:47.331 region:rollup2
COLLEGES I'M NOT SURE EXACTLY

00:47:44.528 --> 00:47:48.833 region:rollup2
HOW MANY INSTITUTIONS WAITED.

00:47:47.331 --> 00:47:50.101 region:rollup2
LOSE THE ABILITY BUT FOR

00:47:48.833 --> 00:47:51.335 region:rollup2
INSTANCE.

00:47:50.101 --> 00:47:53.771 region:rollup2
MILLS COLLEGE IN OAKLAND.

00:47:51.335 --> 00:47:55.906 region:rollup2
HAD RECENTLY BROUGHT IT IN FROM.

00:47:53.771 --> 00:47:57.408 region:rollup2
BEING FULLY IN THE HOUSE TO

00:47:55.906 --> 00:47:58.175 region:rollup2
SAVE THE STUDENTS MONEY. AND

00:47:57.408 --> 00:47:59.610 region:rollup2
THEY'RE BARELY MEETING THE

00:47:58.175 --> 00:48:01.712 region:rollup2
MINIMUM GUARANTEE FOR THEIR

00:47:59.610 --> 00:48:03.481 region:rollup2
PROVIDER. SO IF THEY HAVE

00:48:01.712 --> 00:48:05.015 region:rollup2
STUDENTS OPTING OUT THEY WOULD

00:48:03.481 --> 00:48:06.117 region:rollup2
HAVE TO BRING IT BACK IN BECAUSE

00:48:05.015 --> 00:48:07.184 region:rollup2
THE PROVIDERS

00:48:06.117 --> 00:48:09.120 region:rollup2
WEREN'T WILLING TO COME IN

00:48:07.184 --> 00:48:10.087 region:rollup2
WITHOUT THE GUARANTEE. AYE SOME

00:48:09.120 --> 00:48:11.255 region:rollup2
AND I CAN FIND ADDITIONAL

00:48:10.087 --> 00:48:12.423 region:rollup2
INFORMATION AS TO HOW MANY OF

00:48:11.255 --> 00:48:13.791 region:rollup2
OUR CAMPUSES.

00:48:12.423 --> 00:48:14.925 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD BE BUT TO THE EXTENT

00:48:13.791 --> 00:48:16.093 region:rollup2
THAT WE HAVE TO BRING IT IN

00:48:14.925 --> 00:48:17.194 region:rollup2
HOUSE BECAUSE THE SIZE OF THE

00:48:16.093 --> 00:48:17.428 region:rollup2
INSTITUTIONS OBVIOUSLY IMPACTS

00:48:17.194 --> 00:48:21.365 region:rollup2
COSTS.

00:48:17.428 --> 00:48:23.167 region:rollup2
I'M.

00:48:21.365 --> 00:48:24.535 region:rollup2
PLUGIN ALEX RAISE OF THE CSU AND

00:48:23.167 --> 00:48:27.972 region:rollup2
I THINK I CAN SAY GENERALLY IS

00:48:24.535 --> 00:48:28.739 region:rollup2
THAT.

00:48:27.972 --> 00:48:30.641 region:rollup2
TOP PERSON PROBLEM.

00:48:28.739 --> 00:48:32.676 region:rollup2
I THINK IT'S A GENERALLY IS

00:48:30.641 --> 00:48:33.978 region:rollup2
THAT OUR DINING AND.

00:48:32.676 --> 00:48:35.379 region:rollup2
THROUGH OUR AND HOUSING

00:48:33.978 --> 00:48:36.680 region:rollup2
SERVICES ARE BOTH AUXILIARIES

00:48:35.379 --> 00:48:38.382 region:rollup2
ARE SELF SUPPORT.

00:48:36.680 --> 00:48:40.050 region:rollup2
SO THEY ARE NONPROFIT ENTITIES

00:48:38.382 --> 00:48:41.018 region:rollup2
THEY DON'T MAKE A PROFIT OFF OF

00:48:40.050 --> 00:48:42.686 region:rollup2
STUDENTS.

00:48:41.018 --> 00:48:44.455 region:rollup2
AND WHEN THEY ARE NEGOTIATING

00:48:42.686 --> 00:48:46.190 region:rollup2
THEIR CONTRACTS WITH VENDORS

00:48:44.455 --> 00:48:47.691 region:rollup2
LIKE THE DECKS ON OTHERS ARE

00:48:46.190 --> 00:48:49.026 region:rollup2
OFTENTIMES IN THOSE CONTRACTS

00:48:47.691 --> 00:48:51.362 region:rollup2
THERE ARE BASS LINE REVENUE

00:48:49.026 --> 00:48:52.963 region:rollup2
GUARANTEES THAT AT THAT.

00:48:51.362 --> 00:48:54.532 region:rollup2
THAT WILL LOCK IN THE PRICE

00:48:52.963 --> 00:48:55.866 region:rollup2
POINTS FOR THERE'D THAT EITHER

00:48:54.532 --> 00:48:56.634 region:rollup2
PURCHASING THE SERVICES THAT

00:48:55.866 --> 00:48:59.770 region:rollup2
THEY'RE RECEIVING THOSE

00:48:56.634 --> 00:49:00.204 region:rollup2
CONTRACTS AND SO ON I MEAN IF IF

00:48:59.770 --> 00:49:01.071 region:rollup2
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR.

00:49:00.204 --> 00:49:03.073 region:rollup2
.

00:49:01.071 --> 00:49:04.708 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW SANSOME NUMBERS CRUNCH

00:49:03.073 --> 00:49:06.076 region:rollup2
TIME KIND OF WHITE CHANGE ON ONE

00:49:04.708 --> 00:49:07.144 region:rollup2
SIDE EQUALS CAO ONE ON THE OTHER

00:49:06.076 --> 00:49:08.412 region:rollup2
I DON'T HAVE THAT WITH ME I'D BE

00:49:07.144 --> 00:49:09.814 region:rollup2
HAPPY TO FOLLOW UP AND CHECK IN

00:49:08.412 --> 00:49:10.915 region:rollup2
WITH OUR FOLKS WHO RUN OUR

00:49:09.814 --> 00:49:13.117 region:rollup2
AUXILIARIES ON OUR CAMPUSES.

00:49:10.915 --> 00:49:14.718 region:rollup2
BUT GENERALLY OUR CONCERN IS

00:49:13.117 --> 00:49:16.420 region:rollup2
THAT IF THERE IS.

00:49:14.718 --> 00:49:19.457 region:rollup2
A SIGNIFICANT.

00:49:16.420 --> 00:49:21.559 region:rollup2
OR NOTABLE REDUCTION IN

00:49:19.457 --> 00:49:23.861 region:rollup2
STUDENTS UTILIZING OUR DINING

00:49:21.559 --> 00:49:25.262 region:rollup2
SERVICES THAT THAT IS GOING TO

00:49:23.861 --> 00:49:26.931 region:rollup2
HAVE TO BE MADE UP.

00:49:25.262 --> 00:49:28.666 region:rollup2
LIKELY IN THE FORM OF

00:49:26.931 --> 00:49:30.167 region:rollup2
INCREASING OUR PRICES FOR

00:49:28.666 --> 00:49:31.468 region:rollup2
STUDENTS WHO DO OPT INTO THOSE

00:49:30.167 --> 00:49:32.069 region:rollup2
THING HOW MANY STUDENTS WE TALK

00:49:31.468 --> 00:49:33.537 region:rollup2
ABOUT WHEN HE'S UP THERE IS

00:49:32.069 --> 00:49:35.206 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY VARIES A LOT I BET ON

00:49:33.537 --> 00:49:38.142 region:rollup2
CAMPUS CAMPUS BUT WHAT'S THE

00:49:35.206 --> 00:49:38.976 region:rollup2
GENERAL. BALLPARK THIRD STUDENTS

00:49:38.142 --> 00:49:40.110 region:rollup2
PARTICIPATING DINING SERVICES.

00:49:38.976 --> 00:49:41.645 region:rollup2
I'LL GOSH I HAVE TO FOLLOW UP

00:49:40.110 --> 00:49:43.614 region:rollup2
WITH YOU I AFTER I CHECK WITH

00:49:41.645 --> 00:49:45.015 region:rollup2
OUR FOLKS NINE SENT THOUSANDS OF

STUDENTS I'M SURE IT AND MAKING

00:49:45.015 --> 00:49:48.285 region:rollup2
I WOULD ASSUME SO AND AGAIN I I

00:49:46.884 --> 00:49:49.520 region:rollup2
DON'T WANT TO COMMIT TO NUMBERS

00:49:48.285 --> 00:49:50.855 region:rollup2

00:49:49.520 --> 00:49:52.156 region:rollup2
HAPPY DEFAULT THEIR OFFICE. OKAY

00:49:50.855 --> 00:49:53.524 region:rollup2
YEAH I I STRUGGLE TO SEE A

00:49:52.156 --> 00:49:55.926 region:rollup2
LITTLE BIT HOW THIS IS MUCH OF A

00:49:53.524 --> 00:49:57.628 region:rollup2
PROBLEM FOR THE CSU. AND I YOU

00:49:55.926 --> 00:50:00.531 region:rollup2
KNOW FOR THE SCHOOLS THAT ARE

00:49:57.628 --> 00:50:01.332 region:rollup2
WORSE SETTING POLICY FOR AND.

00:50:00.531 --> 00:50:02.299 region:rollup2
I'M NOT SURE I LIKE THE IDEA

00:50:01.332 --> 00:50:04.068 region:rollup2
THAT YOU'RE FORCING SOME

00:50:02.299 --> 00:50:05.302 region:rollup2
STUDENTS TO HAVE THIS MEAL PLAN

00:50:04.068 --> 00:50:06.704 region:rollup2
ORDER SUBSIDIZE.

00:50:05.302 --> 00:50:07.872 region:rollup2
THE COST FOR EVERYONE I MEAN IN

00:50:06.704 --> 00:50:09.106 region:rollup2
THEORY WE CAN DO THAT WITH ALL

00:50:07.872 --> 00:50:09.907 region:rollup2
KINDS OF THINGS RIGHT YOU DID

00:50:09.106 --> 00:50:11.175 region:rollup2
FOR STUDENTS TO BUY THEIR

00:50:09.907 --> 00:50:12.743 region:rollup2
LAPTOPS FROM THE UNIVERSITIES

00:50:11.175 --> 00:50:13.510 region:rollup2
THAT WE CAN GET BETTER. BOLT

00:50:12.743 --> 00:50:15.346 region:rollup2
DISCOUNTING PRICE.

00:50:13.510 --> 00:50:17.381 region:rollup2
ON THE OTHER HAND.

00:50:15.346 --> 00:50:17.848 region:rollup2
I DO THINK THAT WHEN YOU'RE

00:50:17.381 --> 00:50:18.249 region:rollup2
TALKING ABOUT PRIVATE

00:50:17.848 --> 00:50:19.650 region:rollup2
UNIVERSITY.

00:50:18.249 --> 00:50:20.784 region:rollup2
THAT YOU KNOW WE WOULD HAVE THE

00:50:19.650 --> 00:50:22.119 region:rollup2
FREEDOM TO EXPERIMENT WITH

00:50:20.784 --> 00:50:22.987 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT WAYS OF SETTING UP

00:50:22.119 --> 00:50:24.788 region:rollup2
CAMPUS LIFE.

00:50:22.987 --> 00:50:26.590 region:rollup2
MAYBE THERE'S AN ARGUMENT THAT

00:50:24.788 --> 00:50:28.025 region:rollup2
HAVE A CAMPUS WANTS TO SAY THAT

00:50:26.590 --> 00:50:29.126 region:rollup2
WE WANNA I HAVE EVERYONE TAKE

00:50:28.025 --> 00:50:30.661 region:rollup2

LIVING ON CAMPUS IN ORDER TO

00:50:30.661 --> 00:50:32.997 region:rollup2
BUILD COMMUNITY.

00:50:31.061 --> 00:50:34.231 region:rollup2
THEN MAYBE THEY OUGHT TO HAVE

00:50:32.997 --> 00:50:36.033 region:rollup2
THAT OPTIONS I DO KNOW THAT

00:50:34.231 --> 00:50:37.601 region:rollup2

CALIFORNIA'S PUBLIC SCHOOLS I

00:50:41.505 --> 00:50:44.441 region:rollup2
BET MAYBE NOT THOSE THAT ARE

STUDENTS OF RECEIVING OUR STATE

FUNDING.

00:51:01.625 --> 00:51:04.261 region:rollup2
IF THEY'LL RECEIVE A STATE

00:51:02.993 --> 00:51:08.098 region:rollup2
FUNDING I THINK THAT THEY ARE

00:51:04.261 --> 00:51:08.599 region:rollup2
NOT SUBJECT TO.

00:51:08.098 --> 00:51:10.267 region:rollup2

MISS POINT OF VIEW. OF COLLEGE

00:51:52.176 --> 00:51:55.746 region:rollup2
AFFORDABILITY AND OF

00:51:53.544 --> 00:51:58.482 region:rollup2
TRANSPARENCY WHY AM I SUPPOSED

00:51:55.746 --> 00:52:00.718 region:rollup2
TO JUST BECAUSE I LEAVE ARE. OUT

00:51:58.482 --> 00:52:03.754 region:rollup2
ON THE CAMPUS HOUSING NOT IN MY

00:52:00.718 --> 00:52:05.923 region:rollup2
FORCED TO BUY IN TO MEET PLAN.

00:52:03.754 --> 00:52:08.092 region:rollup2
WHERE I CAN GET BY MUCH LESS

00:52:05.923 --> 00:52:08.993 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD SAY BLOW CONGRESS UP

00:52:08.092 --> 00:52:11.328 region:rollup2

AND I SEE WHETHER THIS SOLUTION

00:52:18.002 --> 00:52:19.670 region:rollup2
IS.

00:52:19.003 --> 00:52:23.107 region:rollup2
IT'S FITTING FOR THEM IS A MIGHT

00:52:19.670 --> 00:52:25.175 region:rollup2
BE FIRST THE CS USE THANK.

00:52:25.175 --> 00:52:28.045 region:rollup2
THERE WERE A LOT OF THE.

00:52:26.243 --> 00:52:30.247 region:rollup2
GOOD POINTS BROUGHT UP TODAY

PART OF YOUR BILL BREAKING OUT

00:52:31.448 --> 00:52:34.451 region:rollup2
THE THE.

00:52:32.116 --> 00:52:37.554 region:rollup2
ROOM AND BOARD AND THE.

00:52:34.451 --> 00:52:38.856 region:rollup2
THAT THE MEAL PLANS AND THEN

00:52:37.554 --> 00:52:40.624 region:rollup2
YOU TO BUT I THINK OTHER.

00:52:38.856 --> 00:52:42.259 region:rollup2
ISSUES THAT WERE BROUGHT UP

00:52:40.624 --> 00:52:43.994 region:rollup2
LIKE FOOD INSECURITY ARE.

00:52:42.259 --> 00:52:45.929 region:rollup2
I THINK THOSE ARE RELEVANT

00:52:43.994 --> 00:52:47.164 region:rollup2
ISSUES LIKE I DO THINK THE

00:52:45.929 --> 00:52:49.600 region:rollup2
COLLEGES SHOULD OFFER

00:52:47.164 --> 00:52:51.301 region:rollup2
FLEXIBILITY SO. UP POTENTIALLY

00:52:49.600 --> 00:52:52.870 region:rollup2
LOWER PRICED MEAL PLANS BUT NOW

00:52:51.301 --> 00:52:53.804 region:rollup2
I LOOK AT THIS IN THE EXTREME IF

00:52:52.870 --> 00:52:56.106 region:rollup2
YOU END UP.

00:52:53.804 --> 00:52:58.442 region:rollup2
BOB IN THE DORM SETTING WITH NO

00:52:56.106 --> 00:52:59.743 region:rollup2
COOKING OF FACILITIES AND A LOT

00:52:58.442 --> 00:53:01.378 region:rollup2
OF THESE STORMS.

00:52:59.743 --> 00:53:03.013 region:rollup2
AND I HAD THREE KIDS THAT WENT

00:53:01.378 --> 00:53:05.516 region:rollup2
THROUGH COLLEGE THEY'RE VERY

00:53:03.013 --> 00:53:06.784 region:rollup2
CROWDED THREE PEOPLE TO A ROOM.

00:53:05.516 --> 00:53:08.285 region:rollup2
THEY ALL TURNED OUT MEAL PLAN

00:53:06.784 --> 00:53:09.453 region:rollup2
AND NOW THEY HAVE THEIR ROOMS

00:53:08.285 --> 00:53:11.555 region:rollup2
FILLED WITH.

00:53:09.453 --> 00:53:13.824 region:rollup2
FOOD YOUR YOUR POTENTIALLY GOING

00:53:11.555 --> 00:53:14.992 region:rollup2
TO HAVE RODENT ISSUES YOU COULD

00:53:13.824 --> 00:53:16.493 region:rollup2
POTENTIALLY HAVE FOOD SAFETY

00:53:14.992 --> 00:53:19.296 region:rollup2
ISSUES AND I THINK IT'S.

00:53:16.493 --> 00:53:22.900 region:rollup2
NOT UNREASONABLE FOR COLLEGES TO

00:53:19.296 --> 00:53:24.134 region:rollup2
TO TRY TO AVOID THAT SITUATION.

00:53:22.900 --> 00:53:24.968 region:rollup2
SO I'M NOT SURE IF YOU HAVE A

00:53:24.134 --> 00:53:26.837 region:rollup2
RESPONSE THAT OR NOT BUT IT'S.

00:53:24.968 --> 00:53:28.372 region:rollup2
.

00:53:26.837 --> 00:53:29.673 region:rollup2
THOSE COLLEGE DORM ROOMS THAT

00:53:28.372 --> 00:53:32.242 region:rollup2
I'VE BEEN TO DON'T NEED

00:53:29.673 --> 00:53:33.610 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL LOAVES OF BREAD OR

00:53:32.242 --> 00:53:35.045 region:rollup2
JARS OF PEANUT BUTTER OF.

00:53:33.610 --> 00:53:35.679 region:rollup2
FLOATING AROUND THAT SOMEBODY

00:53:35.045 --> 00:53:38.749 region:rollup2
DOESN'T HAVE.

00:53:35.679 --> 00:53:41.452 region:rollup2
ANY MEAL PLAN AT ALL YEAH I CAN

00:53:38.749 --> 00:53:41.652 region:rollup2
SEE THAT UP POSSIBILITY.

00:53:41.452 --> 00:53:42.986 region:rollup2
BUT.

00:53:41.652 --> 00:53:45.255 region:rollup2
.

00:53:42.986 --> 00:53:47.291 region:rollup2
ARE. THERE SOME.

00:53:45.255 --> 00:53:49.860 region:rollup2
AS THE CAMPUS PROVIDED A

00:53:47.291 --> 00:53:52.796 region:rollup2
HOUSING. OUT UNITS OUT WITH ME

00:53:49.860 --> 00:53:53.063 region:rollup2
EVEN COOKING FACILITIES SO WHEN

THEY AND.

00:53:53.063 --> 00:53:57.935 region:rollup2
STUDENTS ARE LEAVING THEIR THEY

00:53:55.399 --> 00:54:00.537 region:rollup2
HAVE NO OPTION SO THOSE ARE THE

00:53:57.935 --> 00:54:02.306 region:rollup2
ONES THAT THEY ARE LIKELY IF

00:54:00.537 --> 00:54:04.074 region:rollup2
THEY CAN USE THEIR OUT KITCHEN

00:54:02.306 --> 00:54:05.843 region:rollup2
FACILITIES ABOUT THAT THOSE OUT

00:54:04.074 --> 00:54:08.011 region:rollup2
WITHOUT IT BUT I THINK THIS IS A

00:54:05.843 --> 00:54:10.380 region:rollup2
MATTER OF OUR. COLLEGES SETTING

00:54:08.011 --> 00:54:13.717 region:rollup2
THE OPEN POLICIES ON THE COOKING

00:54:10.380 --> 00:54:18.655 region:rollup2
ITSELF AND UBER AND WHAT ALLOW

00:54:13.717 --> 00:54:19.990 region:rollup2
DECADE IN THE DORMITORIES CELL

00:54:18.655 --> 00:54:21.125 region:rollup2
WITH NO KIDS AND I MANAGED.

00:54:19.990 --> 00:54:21.625 region:rollup2
AND ALLEN SO I MEAN I'M IN

00:54:21.125 --> 00:54:23.026 region:rollup2
AGREEMENT WITH THAT BUT

00:54:21.625 --> 00:54:23.660 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY WITH MY KIDS AND THEY

00:54:23.026 --> 00:54:24.394 region:rollup2
WERE NOT FORCE TO TAKE A MEAL

00:54:23.660 --> 00:54:25.129 region:rollup2
PLAN IF THERE WERE COOKING

00:54:24.394 --> 00:54:26.363 region:rollup2
FACILITIES THEY WERE THEY WERE

00:54:25.129 --> 00:54:26.897 region:rollup2
REQUIRED TO TAKE A MEAL PLAN IF

00:54:26.363 --> 00:54:27.865 region:rollup2
THERE WEREN'T ANY COOKING

00:54:26.897 --> 00:54:30.667 region:rollup2
FACILITIES.

00:54:27.865 --> 00:54:32.569 region:rollup2
THE FBI AREAS SAW IS A FIRE

00:54:30.667 --> 00:54:35.072 region:rollup2
HAZARD THOUGH RULED ON. WHATEVER

00:54:32.569 --> 00:54:36.874 region:rollup2
YEAH ISSUE SANITARY ISSUES SO WE

00:54:35.072 --> 00:54:38.609 region:rollup2
CAN FACE IT BUT I THINK AUTO SET

00:54:36.874 --> 00:54:40.344 region:rollup2
CAN BE SET UP BY THE COLLEGE

00:54:38.609 --> 00:54:40.844 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION YOU KNOW HOW TO

00:54:40.344 --> 00:54:43.981 region:rollup2
PREVENT. SUCH POTENTIAL

00:54:40.844 --> 00:54:46.049 region:rollup2
PROBLEMS.

00:54:43.981 --> 00:54:47.151 region:rollup2
DOCTOR WEBER. OKAY COULD THE YES

00:54:46.049 --> 00:54:49.219 region:rollup2
I APPRECIATE THIS AND AND

00:54:47.151 --> 00:54:51.655 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY THE ISSUE OF OF FOOD

00:54:49.219 --> 00:54:53.390 region:rollup2
INSECURITY AND. AND CAMPUSES IN

00:54:51.655 --> 00:54:54.691 region:rollup2

SAYING THAT THIS WOULD BE

00:54:57.261 --> 00:55:01.031 region:rollup2
CONTINGENT UPON. WHETHER NOT THE

00:54:59.863 --> 00:55:02.800 region:rollup2
DORMITORIES HAD COOKING

00:55:01.031 --> 00:55:04.701 region:rollup2
FACILITIES ARE NOT BECAUSE THIS

00:55:02.800 --> 00:55:05.969 region:rollup2

UPON IN THE LIVING. FACILITIES

00:55:11.875 --> 00:55:15.546 region:rollup2
WITH UP TO TEN FACILITATE ONE

00:55:13.343 --> 00:55:17.381 region:rollup2

UNIT SO WITH THE KITCHEN

00:55:21.051 --> 00:55:26.089 region:rollup2
FACILITIES SO IF THAT'S SO. A

00:55:23.887 --> 00:55:27.858 region:rollup2
LOT BUT THAT. THAT THAT THAT

00:55:26.089 --> 00:55:36.867 region:rollup2
THAT'S A COLLEGE OR A

00:55:27.858 --> 00:55:38.168 region:rollup2
INSTITUTIONALLY OWN THE

00:55:36.867 --> 00:55:39.770 region:rollup2
FACILITIES THAT THEY HAVE NO.

00:55:38.168 --> 00:55:41.271 region:rollup2
THEY DID TO TWO THINGS ARE ON

00:55:39.770 --> 00:55:43.607 region:rollup2
I'M NOT EMPHASIZE SAID THAT IS

00:55:41.271 --> 00:55:44.975 region:rollup2
TARA THE TRANSPARENCY PARENTS

00:55:43.607 --> 00:55:46.710 region:rollup2
ARE. UP WOULD KNOW WHAT THE OUT.

00:55:44.975 --> 00:55:47.945 region:rollup2
PAYING.

00:55:46.710 --> 00:55:50.280 region:rollup2
AND THOSE.

00:55:47.945 --> 00:55:52.182 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WHAT.

00:55:50.280 --> 00:55:55.385 region:rollup2
THEY THEY ARE IT.

00:55:52.182 --> 00:55:57.554 region:rollup2
UP BY DIDN'T WANT BY OUT. GAY

00:55:55.385 --> 00:56:00.224 region:rollup2
AND OUT WE ARE NOT THE FOCUSING

00:55:57.554 --> 00:56:02.893 region:rollup2
UPON ANY UNITS SELL WITH FEE OF

00:56:00.224 --> 00:56:05.128 region:rollup2
UP PUTTING FACILITIES WHY NOT.

00:56:02.893 --> 00:56:08.765 region:rollup2
AND. WHAT IF IT FOR WITH THICK

00:56:05.128 --> 00:56:10.033 region:rollup2
KNOTTED TO FISTS EDITED SO I

00:56:08.765 --> 00:56:10.234 region:rollup2
MEAN THAT CAN THAT CAN BUY AND?

00:56:10.033 --> 00:56:11.134 region:rollup2
AND.

00:56:10.234 --> 00:56:11.735 region:rollup2
WITHOUT THAT TIM FACILITIES TO

00:56:11.134 --> 00:56:13.470 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY FOR THE CONVENIENCE

00:56:11.735 --> 00:56:14.972 region:rollup2
OF.

00:56:13.470 --> 00:56:17.407 region:rollup2
I DON'T THINK ARE IN ALL MY

00:56:14.972 --> 00:56:20.344 region:rollup2
ANTICIPATION IS THAT DATA.

00:56:17.407 --> 00:56:22.212 region:rollup2
NEVER BE DRAMATIC CHANGE.

00:56:20.344 --> 00:56:25.148 region:rollup2
BUT THE I THINK BY BY DOING

00:56:22.212 --> 00:56:26.883 region:rollup2
THIS WAY A COTTAGES TO WOULD BE

00:56:25.148 --> 00:56:28.118 region:rollup2
MORE. COST CONSCIOUS

00:56:26.883 --> 00:56:30.821 region:rollup2
AND.

00:56:28.118 --> 00:56:32.489 region:rollup2
LET THE OUR STUDENTS TO KNOW

00:56:30.821 --> 00:56:34.725 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE WHAT THE OUTLYING INTO

00:56:32.489 --> 00:56:37.027 region:rollup2
AND DONE ANY CALCULATION.

00:56:34.725 --> 00:56:39.062 region:rollup2
FOR THE FOOD CONTRACTING DE

00:56:37.027 --> 00:56:41.932 region:rollup2
WOULD KNOW HOW MUCH IT COST US

00:56:39.062 --> 00:56:43.433 region:rollup2
SO IT IS NOT TOO DIFFICULT TO

00:56:41.932 --> 00:56:46.770 region:rollup2
SEPARATE THE HOUSING UNITS.

00:56:43.433 --> 00:56:50.140 region:rollup2
A AND UP AGAINST OUR.

00:56:46.770 --> 00:56:50.340 region:rollup2
THE MID SET THE PROFILE.

00:56:50.140 --> 00:56:53.777 region:rollup2
OKAY.

00:56:50.340 --> 00:56:55.712 region:rollup2
.

00:56:53.777 --> 00:56:57.381 region:rollup2
I THINK THEY'RE PROBABLY SOME.

00:56:55.712 --> 00:56:58.582 region:rollup2
ROOM FOR OBVIOUSLY SAW MINUTES

00:56:57.381 --> 00:57:00.050 region:rollup2
OF THIS IS SOMETHING BECAUSE

00:56:58.582 --> 00:57:01.618 region:rollup2
I THINK THE DOCUMENT AT LEAST

00:57:00.050 --> 00:57:03.153 region:rollup2
THE ONE I'M LOOKING AT SAYS THAT

00:57:01.618 --> 00:57:04.254 region:rollup2
WE WOULD PROHIBIT.

00:57:03.153 --> 00:57:05.489 region:rollup2
CITIES FROM ACQUIRING STUDENT

00:57:04.254 --> 00:57:06.857 region:rollup2
HAVE A CAMPUS MEAL PLAN AS A

00:57:05.489 --> 00:57:08.892 region:rollup2
CONDITION OF LIVING IN

00:57:06.857 --> 00:57:11.528 region:rollup2
INSTITUTIONALLY OPERATE HOUSING

00:57:08.892 --> 00:57:13.397 region:rollup2
SO I THINK THAT'S LIKE ACROSS

00:57:11.528 --> 00:57:14.531 region:rollup2
THE BOARD VERSUS SAYING. IT

00:57:13.397 --> 00:57:16.099 region:rollup2
UNLESS YOU IF YOU KNEW IT WAS

00:57:14.531 --> 00:57:17.501 region:rollup2
ONLY DESIGNED FOR THOSE PLACES

00:57:16.099 --> 00:57:19.269 region:rollup2
THAT THAT DUMB.

00:57:17.501 --> 00:57:20.404 region:rollup2
BUT DON'T HAVE OR DOES IT DON'T

00:57:19.269 --> 00:57:22.539 region:rollup2
HAVE COOKING FACILITIES OR

00:57:20.404 --> 00:57:23.640 region:rollup2
WHATEVER THEN AND THIS THAT THEN

00:57:22.539 --> 00:57:25.075 region:rollup2
APPLY THEM I MEAN.

00:57:23.640 --> 00:57:26.643 region:rollup2
I I.

00:57:25.075 --> 00:57:27.811 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THIS IS PRETTY A

00:57:26.643 --> 00:57:29.346 region:rollup2
STANDARD TO LOOK LIKE THAT

00:57:27.811 --> 00:57:31.315 region:rollup2
EVERYONE WOULD HAVE TO

00:57:29.346 --> 00:57:33.483 region:rollup2
INSTITUTIONS WOULD HAVE TO.

00:57:31.315 --> 00:57:35.319 region:rollup2
REQUIRE UP HAVE TO GIVE

00:57:33.483 --> 00:57:37.287 region:rollup2
STUDENTS THE OPTION OF HAVING A

00:57:35.319 --> 00:57:39.356 region:rollup2
PLAN AND NO PLAN THAT'S WHAT THE

00:57:37.287 --> 00:57:40.824 region:rollup2
STATE IS SO EVIDENTLY IF YOU. IF

00:57:39.356 --> 00:57:42.959 region:rollup2
YOU ALTERING IT NOW AND SAYING

00:57:40.824 --> 00:57:43.527 region:rollup2

AREA EVEN THE LARGE ONES HAVE A

00:57:58.709 --> 00:58:02.379 region:rollup2
MULTITUDE OF OPTIONS

00:58:00.310 --> 00:58:04.281 region:rollup2
STUDENTS I MEAN IT WOULD BE NICE

00:58:02.379 --> 00:58:04.848 region:rollup2
IF THEY DID BREAK OUT THE COST

00:58:04.281 --> 00:58:06.350 region:rollup2
WHATEVER YOU COULD KIND OF

00:58:04.848 --> 00:58:06.850 region:rollup2
FIGURED OUT TO SELL. BUT MOST OF

00:58:06.350 --> 00:58:08.151 region:rollup2
THE TIME WE GO TO THESE

00:58:06.850 --> 00:58:10.787 region:rollup2
CAMPUSES.

00:58:08.151 --> 00:58:12.756 region:rollup2
THEY HAVE ALL KINDS OF

STUDENTS OF THAT ARE THERE AND

00:58:14.791 --> 00:58:18.328 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEY DO HAVE. OF THE

00:58:17.027 --> 00:58:20.330 region:rollup2
LARGER CAMPUS IS NOT ALWAYS THE

00:58:18.328 --> 00:58:22.132 region:rollup2

THIS OTHER KIND OF STUFF AS WELL

00:58:26.503 --> 00:58:29.339 region:rollup2
AS SOME OTHER THINGS. AND THEN

00:58:27.771 --> 00:58:30.774 region:rollup2
THEY HAVE SOME THE TRADITIONAL

00:58:29.339 --> 00:58:32.409 region:rollup2
AREAS OF PEOPLE LIVE IN BECOMES

00:58:30.774 --> 00:58:34.411 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT TO TRY TO MANDATE THAT

00:58:32.409 --> 00:58:35.345 region:rollup2
THAT WE THAT EVERYBODY HAS TO

00:58:34.411 --> 00:58:37.114 region:rollup2
HAVE A CERTAIN THING.

00:58:35.345 --> 00:58:38.815 region:rollup2
ITEMSI FOUND CAMPUS AS TO BE

00:58:37.114 --> 00:58:40.017 region:rollup2
ALMOST EXTREMELY ACCOMMODATING

00:58:38.815 --> 00:58:41.151 region:rollup2
NOW MUCH MORE WHEN I WITH THE

00:58:40.017 --> 00:58:42.919 region:rollup2
COLLEGE YOU KNOW THAT WASN'T

00:58:41.151 --> 00:58:44.554 region:rollup2
THERE WAS A LOT OF FLEXIBILITY.

00:58:42.919 --> 00:58:46.390 region:rollup2
BUT DID NOW WHEN I GO ON CAMPUS

00:58:44.554 --> 00:58:47.824 region:rollup2
AS YOU FIND ALL KINDS OF LIVING

00:58:46.390 --> 00:58:49.326 region:rollup2

ALL THEY ALSO HAVE MULTIPLE

00:58:49.326 --> 00:58:52.596 region:rollup2
PLANS WHERE YOU CAN HAVE LIKE

00:58:50.360 --> 00:58:53.864 region:rollup2
ONE MEAL A DAY OR TWO MEALS A

00:58:52.596 --> 00:58:55.432 region:rollup2
DAY OR WHATEVER.

00:58:53.864 --> 00:58:56.833 region:rollup2
AND AND THE STUDENTS HAVE A

00:58:55.432 --> 00:58:58.502 region:rollup2
TENDENCY TO FAMILIES PICK WHAT

00:58:56.833 --> 00:59:01.171 region:rollup2
THEY THINK IS BEST AT THIS POINT

00:58:58.502 --> 00:59:01.605 region:rollup2
BUT. I'M NOT SURE IF THIS IS

00:59:01.171 --> 00:59:02.773 region:rollup2
CLEAR ENOUGH ABOUT.

00:59:01.605 --> 00:59:04.474 region:rollup2
WHAT I WANT TO MANDATE THAT

00:59:02.773 --> 00:59:05.942 region:rollup2
EVERYONE HAS TO HAVE TO SET THE

00:59:04.474 --> 00:59:07.677 region:rollup2
SEPARATE HAVE AN OPTION TO HAVE

00:59:05.942 --> 00:59:09.479 region:rollup2
A MEAL PLAN NO MEAL PLAN?

00:59:07.677 --> 00:59:10.380 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I AB AS POINTED OUT BY

00:59:09.479 --> 00:59:12.249 region:rollup2
MY COLLEAGUE HERE.

00:59:10.380 --> 00:59:14.284 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW DORMS CAN GET TO BE

00:59:12.249 --> 00:59:16.319 region:rollup2
SOME REALLY TRASHY PLACES IF YOU

00:59:14.284 --> 00:59:17.120 region:rollup2
FELT STUDENTS TRYING TO COOK

00:59:16.319 --> 00:59:19.122 region:rollup2
INTO MY BEEN AND BELONG TO

00:59:17.120 --> 00:59:19.689 region:rollup2
PEOPLE AT THAT PLACE THAT WAS A

00:59:19.122 --> 00:59:20.957 region:rollup2
DISASTER.

00:59:19.689 --> 00:59:24.061 region:rollup2
SET THINGS ON FIRE.

00:59:20.957 --> 00:59:26.663 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW TRIED TO COOK YOU KNOW

00:59:24.061 --> 00:59:28.331 region:rollup2
BUGS AND STUFF RENDON EVERYWHERE

00:59:26.663 --> 00:59:29.599 region:rollup2
YOU CAN IMAGINE A STUDENTS

00:59:28.331 --> 00:59:31.334 region:rollup2
MAKING TACKLES IN A ROOM ONE

00:59:29.599 --> 00:59:33.470 region:rollup2

STUFF AND THAT YOU WOULD WANT IN

00:59:33.470 --> 00:59:36.540 region:rollup2
A NORMAL LIVING CONDITION GIVEN

00:59:34.504 --> 00:59:38.375 region:rollup2
THE CONDITIONS OF THE DORMITORY

00:59:36.540 --> 00:59:40.077 region:rollup2
BEING A VERY SMALL ROOM SO. I'M

00:59:38.375 --> 00:59:41.711 region:rollup2
NOT SURE IF I WANT TO MANDATE

00:59:40.077 --> 00:59:43.814 region:rollup2
THAT EVERYBODY HAS TO HAVE THE

00:59:41.711 --> 00:59:45.482 region:rollup2
OPTION OF NOT HAVING FOOD

00:59:43.814 --> 00:59:47.284 region:rollup2
BECAUSE. I DON'T LET KIND OF

00:59:45.482 --> 00:59:48.251 region:rollup2
PLAYS WITH THE THE OVERALL

00:59:47.284 --> 00:59:50.153 region:rollup2
GENERAL PLAN THAT'S THERE BUT IF

00:59:48.251 --> 00:59:51.288 region:rollup2
YOU. EXITING OUT THOSE OF THE

00:59:50.153 --> 00:59:52.756 region:rollup2
PLACES THEM THAT'S NOT REALLY

00:59:51.288 --> 00:59:54.191 region:rollup2
REFLECTED HERE AND THEN WHAT

I'VE READ IS THE NARRATIVE YEAR.

00:59:54.191 --> 00:59:57.594 region:rollup2
AND IF YOU INTEND TO OP THEM OUT

00:59:55.892 --> 00:59:58.628 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THAT WOULD BE. TO

00:59:57.594 --> 01:00:00.530 region:rollup2
MAKE THE BILL A LITTLE BIT

00:59:58.628 --> 01:00:02.132 region:rollup2
BETTER FOR THOSE WHO HAVE SOME

01:00:00.530 --> 01:00:04.134 region:rollup2
CONCERNS ABOUT SAFETY ISSUES AND

01:00:02.132 --> 01:00:05.836 region:rollup2
LIVING CONDITIONS IN DORMITORIES

01:16:35.424 --> 01:16:38.294 region:rollup2
COULD TAKE IS THE STATE COULD

01:16:36.659 --> 01:16:38.627 region:rollup2
STEP IN AND TRY TO EXTEND THAT

01:16:38.294 --> 01:16:40.563 region:rollup2
GRACE PERIOD.

01:16:38.627 --> 01:16:41.931 region:rollup2
.

01:16:40.563 --> 01:16:43.732 region:rollup2
EITHER BY ASSUMING WHATEVER THE.

01:16:41.931 --> 01:16:44.500 region:rollup2
PAINFUL OF THE INTEREST IS OR

01:16:43.732 --> 01:16:46.435 region:rollup2
PERHAPS SOMETHING EVEN BE

01:16:44.500 --> 01:16:48.137 region:rollup2
NEGOTIATED. WITH THAT WITH

01:16:46.435 --> 01:16:49.805 region:rollup2
PROVIDERS UNDER THIS IS TAKING A

01:16:48.137 --> 01:16:51.674 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT APPROACH AND HAVING

01:16:49.805 --> 01:16:52.875 region:rollup2
THE STATE IS KIND OF STEP IN.

01:16:51.674 --> 01:16:55.144 region:rollup2
AND AND MAKE THE PAYMENTS ITSELF

01:16:52.875 --> 01:16:56.312 region:rollup2
I'M JUST CURIOUS WHY YOU OPTED

01:16:55.144 --> 01:16:57.880 region:rollup2
TO GO THAT DIRECTION IS THAT THE

01:16:56.312 --> 01:16:58.948 region:rollup2
WAY NEW YORK HAS A FOR EXAMPLE.

01:16:57.880 --> 01:17:00.816 region:rollup2
THAT IS ONE EXAMPLE.

01:16:58.948 --> 01:17:02.818 region:rollup2
THAT HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN SO

01:17:00.816 --> 01:17:05.020 region:rollup2
WE CERTAINLY WOULD LIKE TO LOOK

01:17:02.818 --> 01:17:07.389 region:rollup2
AT THIS OPTION IS A WASTE HOW

01:17:05.020 --> 01:17:08.691 region:rollup2
OUR STUDENTS ARE RELIEVED DOT.

01:17:07.389 --> 01:17:10.192 region:rollup2
DOT.

01:17:08.691 --> 01:17:11.527 region:rollup2
RIGHT BUT THE IDEA IS TO EXTEND

01:17:10.192 --> 01:17:11.794 region:rollup2
THE GRACE PERIOD AND SO I'M

01:17:11.527 --> 01:17:13.162 region:rollup2
WONDERING.

01:17:11.794 --> 01:17:14.864 region:rollup2
.

01:17:13.162 --> 01:17:16.031 region:rollup2
IF THERE MIGHT BE A WAY TO DO

01:17:14.864 --> 01:17:16.866 region:rollup2
THAT WITHOUT THE STATE JUST

01:17:16.031 --> 01:17:20.236 region:rollup2
TAKING ON.

01:17:16.866 --> 01:17:21.070 region:rollup2
THAT THE PAYMENTS ITSELF.

01:17:20.236 --> 01:17:23.372 region:rollup2
I DO HAVE YOU EXPLORE THAT

01:17:21.070 --> 01:17:23.973 region:rollup2
OPTION WELL IT'S CERTAINLY A

01:17:23.372 --> 01:17:26.075 region:rollup2
MEASURE WE CAN LOOK AT IN THE

01:17:23.973 --> 01:17:27.843 region:rollup2
FUTURE.

01:17:26.075 --> 01:17:29.211 region:rollup2
OKAY.

01:17:27.843 --> 01:17:30.613 region:rollup2
YOU GUYS I THINK I DON'T NOT

01:17:29.211 --> 01:17:33.349 region:rollup2
WHITE THAT THIS APPROACH MIGHT

01:17:30.613 --> 01:17:35.584 region:rollup2
BE PREFERABLE.

01:17:33.349 --> 01:17:37.586 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY A GRACE PERIOD IS IS

01:17:35.584 --> 01:17:38.921 region:rollup2
IS VALUABLE BUT ON THAT DOESN'T

01:17:37.586 --> 01:17:41.056 region:rollup2
CHANGE THE INTERESTS THAT A

01:17:38.921 --> 01:17:42.191 region:rollup2
STUDENT HAS TO PAY I THINK FROM

01:17:41.056 --> 01:17:43.893 region:rollup2
FROM OUR ORGANIZATIONS

01:17:42.191 --> 01:17:45.861 region:rollup2
PERSPECTIVE THE IDEA OF

01:17:43.893 --> 01:17:47.663 region:rollup2
RELIEVING SOME OF THAT DEBT IS

01:17:45.861 --> 01:17:50.733 region:rollup2
EXTREMELY VALUABLE TO STUDENTS.

01:17:47.663 --> 01:17:55.371 region:rollup2
OKAY THANK YOU.

01:17:50.733 --> 01:17:56.438 region:rollup2
ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS.

01:17:55.371 --> 01:17:58.040 region:rollup2
I DO NOT BUT I JUST WANT SOME

01:17:56.438 --> 01:17:58.207 region:rollup2
CLARIFICATION.

01:17:58.040 --> 01:18:00.042 region:rollup2
THE.

01:17:58.207 --> 01:18:00.910 region:rollup2
SO FORWARD.

01:18:00.042 --> 01:18:02.411 region:rollup2
TWO YEARS WE WOULD MAKE THE

01:18:00.910 --> 01:18:04.246 region:rollup2
PAYMENT.

01:18:02.411 --> 01:18:06.382 region:rollup2
IS THAT RIGHT FOR UP TO TWENTY

01:18:04.246 --> 01:18:07.917 region:rollup2

PARKING HOW MANY YEARS.

01:18:13.923 --> 01:18:17.026 region:rollup2
TEN YEARS. IT WOULD DEPEND I

01:18:15.758 --> 01:18:18.360 region:rollup2
MEAN THE AVERAGE DEBT LOAD OF

01:18:17.026 --> 01:18:19.495 region:rollup2
ITS IF YOU SEE IN THIS AROUND

01:18:18.360 --> 01:18:21.197 region:rollup2
SIXTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS SO

01:18:19.495 --> 01:18:22.731 region:rollup2
THING SIXTY THOUSAND DOLLARS SO

01:18:21.197 --> 01:18:24.266 region:rollup2

01:18:32.708 --> 01:18:36.745 region:rollup2
CORRECT PROBABLY SO SO THE IT'S

01:18:34.843 --> 01:18:38.480 region:rollup2
BASED OFF OF INCOME AND FAMILY

DISCRIMINATION THIS WAGE

01:34:29.697 --> 01:34:33.268 region:rollup2
DISPARITY MAKES IT EVEN HARDER

01:34:34.969 --> 01:34:39.240 region:rollup2
IMPORTANTLY THIS BILL IS ABOUT

EQUALITY BY CREATING AN INCOME

01:34:39.240 --> 01:34:42.744 region:rollup2

AN EDUCATION KNOWING THEY CAN

FLEXIBILITY TO REPAY THEIR LOANS

01:34:52.820 --> 01:34:55.924 region:rollup2
UPON GRADUATION.

01:34:54.255 --> 01:34:57.692 region:rollup2
I RESPECTFULLY ASK WHEN I VOTE

01:34:55.924 --> 01:35:00.495 region:rollup2
AND AND I WILL SAY.

01:34:57.692 --> 01:35:01.829 region:rollup2
THAT YOU KNOW WITH WITH.

01:35:00.495 --> 01:35:03.331 region:rollup2
WITH THE FACT THAT WE DO HAVE

01:35:01.829 --> 01:35:04.899 region:rollup2
DISABILITY IN CALIFORNIA FOR THE

01:35:03.331 --> 01:35:06.935 region:rollup2
STUDENTS TO ACCEPT THESE LOANS.

01:35:04.899 --> 01:35:08.836 region:rollup2
AND THE FACT THAT THERE IS

01:35:06.935 --> 01:35:10.838 region:rollup2
UNCERTAINTY RIGHT NOW WITH THAT

01:35:08.836 --> 01:35:12.440 region:rollup2
WITH WITH THE PROGRAM. ARE

01:35:10.838 --> 01:35:13.641 region:rollup2
INCOME BASED REPAYMENT PROGRAM

01:35:12.440 --> 01:35:15.743 region:rollup2
IS WHAT'S FAIR AND IS SOMETHING

01:35:13.641 --> 01:35:17.679 region:rollup2
THAT WE NEED TO OUR TO PUT INTO

01:35:15.743 --> 01:35:19.581 region:rollup2
LAW CODIFIED INTO LAW OUR

01:35:17.679 --> 01:35:20.515 region:rollup2
STUDENTS WHO ARE DOCUMENTED THAT

01:35:19.581 --> 01:35:23.151 region:rollup2
HAVE STUDENT LOANS.

01:35:20.515 --> 01:35:25.186 region:rollup2
THEY CAN APPLY AND GET A A.

01:35:23.151 --> 01:35:26.621 region:rollup2
UP INCOME BASED PAYMENT PROGRAM

01:35:25.186 --> 01:35:28.289 region:rollup2
SO THIS IS SOMETHING THAT ISN'T

01:35:26.621 --> 01:35:30.158 region:rollup2
NEW THIS ISN'T SOMETHING THAT

01:35:28.289 --> 01:35:31.693 region:rollup2
SOMEBODY WHO IS YOU KNOW A

01:35:30.158 --> 01:35:32.961 region:rollup2
DOCUMENT STUDENT DOESN'T HAVE

01:35:31.693 --> 01:35:34.028 region:rollup2
ACCESS TO AS WELL THROUGH THE

01:35:32.961 --> 01:35:35.230 region:rollup2
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THEY CAN

01:35:34.028 --> 01:35:36.664 region:rollup2
PUBLIC IMPLYING GET THE SAME

01:35:35.230 --> 01:35:39.267 region:rollup2
STATUS. SO I THINK IT'S ONLY

01:35:36.664 --> 01:35:41.002 region:rollup2
FAIR ARE YOU KNOW THAT WE CAN

01:35:39.267 --> 01:35:42.570 region:rollup2
CREATE THE SAME STANDARDS FOR

01:35:41.002 --> 01:35:44.772 region:rollup2

I'VE NEVER LIVED ANYWHERE ELSE

01:35:55.350 --> 01:35:58.987 region:rollup2
SO I THINK IS REALLY IMPORTANT.

01:35:57.685 --> 01:36:00.321 region:rollup2
THAT WE IMPLEMENT SOME LIKE

01:35:58.987 --> 01:36:01.623 region:rollup2
THIS IT'S REALLY SMALL BUT IT

01:36:00.321 --> 01:36:03.091 region:rollup2
GOES A LONG WAY TO MAKES A BIG

01:36:01.623 --> 01:36:04.192 region:rollup2
DIFFERENCE IN ITS IN ITS FAIR.

01:36:03.091 --> 01:36:05.727 region:rollup2

STUDENTS WHO WERE FOOD IN

01:47:38.852 --> 01:47:43.891 region:rollup2
SECURING HOMELESS WERE THEIR

01:47:40.754 --> 01:47:45.559 region:rollup2
GPAS WERE LOWER THEIR ACADEMIC

01:47:43.891 --> 01:47:47.127 region:rollup2

THEY WERE EXPERIENCING AND

01:47:51.365 --> 01:47:55.602 region:rollup2
NEGATIVE IMPACTS FOR THOSE. AND

01:47:54.068 --> 01:47:57.237 region:rollup2
WHEN WE LOOK THAT STUDENTS WHO

01:47:55.602 --> 01:47:58.605 region:rollup2
WERE VERY LOW FOOD SECURE SO

01:47:57.237 --> 01:48:00.774 region:rollup2
THESE ARE THE STUDENTS WHO WERE

WHO ARE EXPERIENCING HUNGER. AND

01:48:00.774 --> 01:48:03.410 region:rollup2

EXPERIENCING

01:48:04.345 --> 01:48:08.048 region:rollup2
I. THINK THEM THAT GO ALONG WITH

01:48:06.313 --> 01:48:10.150 region:rollup2

01:48:13.887 --> 01:48:16.523 region:rollup2
FOOD IN SECURING HOMELESS

01:48:14.555 --> 01:48:18.892 region:rollup2

01:48:22.629 --> 01:48:26.133 region:rollup2
HOUSING SECURE COUNTERPARTS.

01:48:23.964 --> 01:48:27.868 region:rollup2
