EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR AND PHOEBE'S SO JOURNAL TO MY WITNESSES. MANAGER HELLO -- I'M PHOEBE **** AND I'M A RISING SENIOR GOT HIGH SCHOOL IN PALO ALTO -- FRESHMAN YEAR I USED TO FALL ASLEEP READING ARTICLES ABOUT WHAT HILLS WOULD BE LEGAL. OR WITH A KITCHEN KNIFE UNDER MY PILLOW JUST IN CASE THINGS GOT TOO HARD TO HANDLE. IT FELT LIKE A SECURITY BLANKET HAVING THE CONTROLLED END IT ALL. AS A YOUNG PERSON AND AN ADULT DOMINATED WORLD I AND MANY OF MY PEERS FEEL LACK OF CONTROL OVER ABUNDANCE OF FACTORS IN OUR LIVES. WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE MUCH FREEDOM WHEN INDEPENDENCE AND ADULTHOOD LOOMS AHEAD ASKING FOR HELP FEELS LIKE A STEP BACKWARDS? I'VE GROWN UP FORTUNATE SO WHEN I STARTED FEELING DEPRESSED I FEEL GUILTY LIKE I DIDN'T DESERVE TO FEEL THE WAY THAT I DID. BUT THE LONGER I HELD IT IN THE MORE. THE MORE A GOTTEN GOTTEN -- MY GRADES STARTED TO SLIP SECOND SEMESTER OF MY FRESHMAN YEAR. AND SCHOOL STRESS ISOLATED ME FROM REALITY. THEN I STARTED GETTING VALIDATION FROM A BOY TWO YEARS OLDER THAN ME -- IN A WORLD WHERE GRADES DISPLAYED WORTH I FELT LIKE MORE THAN THAT TO HIM. AND THIS IN SECURITY AND BLIND TRUST ME TO BE IN A BATHROOM WHERE I WAS SEXUALLY ASSAULTED. BY THE TRUSTED PERSON I TRUSTED THE MOST. HE LEFT ME AND I FELT HUMILIATED I FELT LIKE MY ONLY OPTIONS WERE TO STRUGGLE THROUGH IT ALONE OR KILL MYSELF. BECAUSE REACHING OUT WOULD MEAN SURRENDERING ANY FREEDOM THAT I DID HAVE. AFTER GETTING HOSPITALIZED IN PROCESSING WHAT I'D BEEN THROUGH WITH A NEW THERAPIST I HAD A NEED TO CHANGE OUR SUPPORT SYSTEM FOR YOU. ALL CO HELPED ME FIND MY CONTROL AGAIN. IT GAVE ME HOPE THAT OTHER ADOLESCENTS WHO FELT LIKE I FELT. CAN GET HELP AND THAT SELF AWARENESS AND REACHING OUT FOR SUPPORT WOULD BE TREATED AS A SIGN OF MATURITY AND STRENGTH AS OPPOSED TO WEAKNESS. I NEEDED A SPACE THAT WASN'T AT SCHOOL A PLACE I COULD GO TO TO BE VULNERABLE. NOT FEEL LIKE A LIABILITY ISSUE I DON'T KNOW WHETHER OR NOT I WOULD HAVE GONE TO ALTHOUGH IF IT WERE BEEN IT'D BEEN A POSSIBILITY FOR ME. BUT HAVING THAT SAFETY NET AND A RESOURCE TO TURN TO BEFORE RESORTING AND SUICIDE NEEDS TO BE AN OPTION FOR OUR YOUTH. THANK YOU. MEDICARE MEMBERS TOBY OWING THEY TAKE A DIRECT MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY COMMISSION I'D I DON'T THINK I WAS PREPARED TO SIT NEXT TO TV TODAY. AND SO I WANT TO THANK HER FOR COMING AND SHARING THAT STORY. I CAN TELL YOU THAT -- FROM THE COMMISSION'S PERSPECTIVE WE HEAR FAR TOO OFTEN. THAT YOUNG PEOPLE DON'T FIND THE SERVICES THEY NEED DESIGNED IN A WAY THAT IS APPROPRIATE FOR THOSE NEEDS AND WHO THEY ARE. IN THE COMMUNITY SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE -- THE COMMISSION IS SPONSORING THIS LEGISLATION SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE IT IT INTENDS -- TO CHANGE THE SYSTEM BY STARTING WITH THE NEEDS OF YOUNG PEOPLE. AND MAKING FUNDS AVAILABLE IN A STRATEGY AVAILABLE TO ENSURE THAT OUR SYSTEM IS. ASKING YOUNG PEOPLE WHAT THOSE NEEDS ARE HOW TO DESIGN SERVICES IN WAYS THAT ARE APPROPRIATE FOR THOSE NEEDS. AND THAT THAT THAT WE CAN DELIVER A RANGE OF SERVICES THAT ARE TAILORED TO THEIR INTEGRATED. AND THAT HAVE THIS THE TREMENDOUS POTENTIAL THAT WE'VE SEEN IN OTHER COUNTRIES TO RESULT IN THE KINDS OF OUTCOMES WE NEED IN CALIFORNIA. NAMELY THAT WE HELP PEOPLE WORK THROUGH THE ISSUES THAT ARE AFFECTING THEIR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. THAT WE RECOGNIZE HOW IMPORTANT IT IS FOR YOUNG PEOPLE TO GRADUATE FROM HIGH SCHOOL TO FIND THOSE SOCIAL SUPPORT IN THOSE NETWORKS TO FIND EMPLOYMENT.

OKAY WELL WAIT UNTIL WE HAVE A QUORUM AND LOG -- DO THE MOTION AT THAT TIME. OKAY WE'LL MOVE ON TO SB. FIVE EIGHTY TWO FOR SENATOR BILL. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS -- SB FIVE EIGHTY TWO IS THE SORT OF THE SECOND HALF OF THE USE MENTAL HEALTH EQUATION. THIS BILL WILL BOLSTER MENTAL HEALTH PARTNERSHIPS. TO MAKE SURE. SCHOOL OF CHILDREN RECEIVE HELP AND SCHOOL SETTINGS -- 50% OF ALL LIKE TIME CASES OF MENTAL HEALTH BEGIN BY AGE FOURTEEN AGAIN. SO AT LEAST 50% OF OUR TENSION A RESOURCES. PROBABLY SHOULD BE FOCUSED ON YOU. WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE GIVING SCHOOLS. THE RESOURCES THEY NEED. SO THAT YOUTH AND SCHOOL SETTINGS HAVE MENTAL HEALTH SUPPORT. ALSO I MIGHT ADD THE TEACHERS SHOULD HAVE. SUB SUPPORT. IF YOU EVER HEARD FROM TEACHERS. THAT TEACH TEACH IN CLASSROOMS WITH MAYBE ONE OR EVEN TWO STUDENTS WITH A BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PROBLEM. IT WILL DISRUPT THE WHOLE CLASS. SO THEY NEED SUPPORT. TO AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR SCHOOLS -- HAVE THE RESOURCES THAT THEY NEED SO YOUTH IN SCHOOL SETTINGS HAVE THAT SUPPORT. THIS MENTAL HELP TRIAGE FRONTS ARE INTENDED TO HAVE A FOCUS ON YOUTH AND CHILDREN BUT THE MAJORITY THE FUNDS HAVE BEEN USE ACTUALLY FOR ADULTS NOT CHILDREN. IT'S KIND OF INTERESTING. THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AND OVERSIGHT ACCOUNTABILITY COMMISSION HAS BEEN WORKING. TO CORRECT THIS INDIRECT -- MORE OF THESE GRANTS TO PROGRAMS THAT SERVE YOU. SB. FIVE EIGHTY TWO REQUIRES THAT FUNDS BE ALLOCATED TO THE YOUTH PROGRAMS. THE FUNDING INCENTIVIZE IS COUNTIES AND SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO PARTNER. AND INTEGRATE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES IN THE SCHOOLS. AND WE EXPECT THE POOL OF APPLICANTS TO SIGNIFICANT INCREASE GIVEN THE SIGNIFICANT NEED AN INTEREST IN A GREAT. MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES IN THE SCHOOLS. NOW FOR EXAMPLE OF ONE OF THE CORE DEMANDS. RECENTLY. IN LOS ANGELES. WHAT TEACHERS WERE THEY WERE ON STRIKE AND THEY WANTED TO PROVIDE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ON SCHOOL SITES? WHAT THEY CALL COMMUNITIES BASED SCHOOL SO THEY HAD A? THEY SAID WELL WE'RE HAVING OVERCROWDED CLASSROOMS WE NEED HELP. IN THE CLASSROOM WE LIKE TO HAVE. SOME SUPPORT. FOR US TEACHERS. IN THE CLASSROOM AND WE THINK ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS TO HAVE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PROGRAMS. TO HELP US DO A BETTER JOB TEACHING. THE BILL ENJOYS SUPPORT OF THE MAIL HELP PROVIDERS AS LONG AS SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS AND ALL TURN OVER TO OUR WITNESSES AND TURN OVER WITNESSES THAT. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON YVONNE COUNTRY WITH THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS. AT THIS COMMITTEE IT IS WELL AWARE -- OUR THIRD WE'RE FACING HISTORIC RATES IN TERMS OF STUDENT MENTAL HEALTH -- MY COLLEAGUES AND I CAN'T GO ANYWHERE -- IN THE STATE WITHOUT HEARING GUT WRENCHING STORIES OF RELATED TO ANXIETY DEPRESSION. TRAUMA SUICIDE IDEATION. I'LL JUST QUICKLY SHARE A FEW OF THE STORIES SOME OF THEM ARE RELATED TO ANXIETY LEVELS REACHING THE POINT OF TEMPORARY PARALYSIS. SOME OF THEM ARE RELATED TO TO STUDENTS ATTEMPTING TO COPE WITH THE LOSS OF FRIENDS AND WILD FIRES. AND FAR TOO MANY OF THEM TRAGICALLY ARE ARE RELATED TO YOUNG CHILDREN -- COMMITTING SUICIDE -- IN IN WHAT'S BECOME VERY CLEAR IT SET SET TO US AS AN ASSOCIATION IS THAT THESE ARE NOT HAPPENING IN ISOLATION -- WITH THE THEY'RE NOT EXCEPTIONS TO THE RULE -- THE THE THESE ARE BECOMING THE NORM UNFORTUNATELY. I MEAN WE REALLY BELIEVE THAT SCHOOLS ARE IN A PRIME POSITION TO TO HELP MEET THE NEEDS. OF OF STUDENTS TO MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS OF STUDENTS. ON WALL EDUCATORS ARE WELL INTENTIONED -- STUDENTS NEED DIRECT ACCESS TO MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS -- IN THIS BILL WILL WILL HELP ACHIEVE THAT -- WE WE BELIEVE THAT. THE HIGHER PRIORITIZATION OF THE USE OF THE FUNDS WILL BE TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS IN SCHOOLS. THE NUMBER THE AMOUNT OF TIME THAT STUDENTS SPEND ON CAMPUS ALLOWS MENTAL PROBLEM HEALTH PROFESSIONALS DEVELOP WITH THE TRUSTING RELATIONSHIPS -- WITH WITH KIDS -- BUT ALSO IT IT'S ABOUT ACCESSIBILITY. AND FAR TOO OFTEN COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES AREN'T ACCESSIBLE PARTICULARLY IN RURAL AND REMOTE AREAS -- WITHIN YOUR SERVICE A PROVIDER MAY BE A THIRTY MINUTE DRIVE AWAY -- SO WE WE WERE STRONG SUPPORT OF SB FIVE EIGHT TWO AND AND RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR IDOL. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS AGAIN TOBY OWING WITH THE MENTAL HEALTH COMMISSION.

FOR OLDER FO IT FOR ADULTS IT'S HOMELESSNESS AND CRIMINAL JUSTICE INVOLVEMENT BUT FOR CHILDREN AND YOUTH IT'S THE CHALLENGES THAT WE'RE SEEING IN THE SCHOOL SITES IN TERMS OF EDUCATIONAL OUTCOMES. MEN HOUSE SERVICES ACT EXPLICITLY IDENTIFIES SUPPORTING THE ABILITY OF YOUNG PEOPLE TO THE STATE IN SCHOOL. AS A BEHAVIORAL HEALTH GOAL. THE COMMISSION HAS DONE A NUMBER OF THINGS AS SENATOR BILL POINTS OUT TO A LINE THE DOLLARS THAT ARE CURRENTLY AVAILABLE WITH THIS GOAL WHAT SB FIVE EIGHTY TWO IS IS PUTS THAT IN STATUTE PROVIDES SOME ADDITIONAL FLEXIBILITY. TO USE THESE FUNDS IN WAYS THAT ARE MORE TAILORED TO THE LOCAL NEEDS. AND IT REALLY CREATE SOME INCENTIVES TO STRENGTHEN THE OPPORTUNITIES BETWEEN COUNTIES AND SCHOOLS THAT WE CAN DELIVER CARE IN WAYS THAT ARE VERY MEANINGFUL FOR YOUNG PEOPLE. IT IS AS THE SENATOR SAID IN SOME WAYS A COMPANION TO THE OTHER BILL TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE SERVICES AVAILABLE IN THE COMMUNITY AS WELL AS ON CAMPUSES.

YOU KNOW THANK YOU GOOD. YES. ABSOLUTELY -- THE BILL DEFINES -- YOUTH -- S. U. D. TREATMENT SERVICES TO INCLUDE ANY PUBLICLY FUNDED DIRECT SERVICES INTENDED TO ADDRESS OR TO TREAT AS YOU DIS -- FOR INDIVIDUALS FROM BIRTH TO TWENTY SIX YEARS OF AGE CALIFORNIA'S MADE NUMEROUS ATTEMPTS TO ADDRESS THE COMPLEX NOT OF ISSUES RELATED TO MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE. AND THE OUR SYSTEM AND PROGRAMS DON'T SEEM TO ALWAYS CARRY OUT OUR INTENTIONS -- WE SEE THE RESULTS AROUND US ON THE STREETS AND OUR SCHOOLS AND IN CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. MULTIPLE STUDIES HAVE ESTABLISHED THAT ADOLESCENTS ARE MORE VULNERABLE THAN ADULTS TO ALCOHOL CANNABIS TOBACCO AND OTHER DRUG RELATED PROBLEMS. SERVICES FOR YOUTH NEED TO BE INTEGRATED AND WRAP AROUND -- AND ARE NECESSARY TO SERVE THE YOUTH MOST IN NEED WHEREVER THEY ARE IN THE COMMUNITY. I WHETHER IT'S ON THE STREETS IN A HOMELESS SHELTER OR IN A FOSTER CARE OR GROUP HOME OR IN SCHOOLS. THIS BILL SEEKS TO ADDRESS ALL OF THESE ISSUES THROUGH THE DEVELOPMENT OF THIS YOU TREATMENT STANDARD FOR CHILDREN ADOLESCENTS AND YOUNG ADULTS BY SPECIFICALLY ADDRESSING THEIR NEEDS. AS DIFFERENT AND THIS DISTINCT FROM ADULTS -- BY DEVELOPING A NEW METHODOLOGY FOR CARING FOR OUR YOUNGER POPULOUS POPULATION WITH ME TODAY HAVE DR -- TìM SIR MACK -- FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA SOCIETY OF ADDICTION MEDICINE AND VOTED I SAY THAT RIGHT I HOPE. I WAS I CLOSE. WHY? WHY VOTE A SANTA CLARA COUNTY -- PSYCHIATRIST AND THERAPIST AND RESPECTFULLY ASK WHEN I BUT WHEN YOU HAVE A CORPSMAN CAN VOTE. WELCOME DOCTOR SEARCH SERMON. WELCOME. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TO TESTIFY HERE I'VE BEEN WORKING ON TRYING TO CREATE A SYSTEM. INTEGRATED SYSTEM FOR A TREATMENT OF ADOLESCENTS SUBSTANCE USE. SINCE -- TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN WHEN I WROTE TO YOU FIRST -- FOUR THE CAL FOR CALIFORNIA SOCIETY OF ADDICTION MEDICINE I WAS I CHAIRED THE YOUTH WORK GROUP FOR THE BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION. ON MARIJUANA POLICY AND IS AND LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR NEWSOME AND I HAVE -- I'M THE AUTHOR OF THE MODEL SET OF STANDARDS FOR A USED TREATMENT -- FOR THE CALIFORNIA SOCIETY OF ADDICTION MEDICINE I BROUGHT COPIES -- FOR FOR THE MEMBERS HERE -- THIS IS WHAT STANDARDS COMES DOWN. TO WE NEED A INTEGRATED CONTINUUM OF CARE A SYSTEM OF CARE. IF WE DON'T HAVE STANDARDS THEN THE PROGRAMS THAT GET FUNDED WILL BE PROGRAMS WHICH ARE -- BROUGHT TO US BY -- PRIVATE -- TREATMENT CENTERS BY PREVENTION ENTREPRENEURS BY DIFFERENT -- GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES AND WE WILL END UP WITH A COLLECTION A A FRAGMENTED COLLECTION OF SERVICES FOR YOUTH. WE NEED TO TAKE THE MONEY THAT'S AVAILABLE THROUGH PROP SIXTY FOUR AND YES PDT AND MENTAL HEALTH. ARE COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH AND CREATE AN INTEGRATED SYSTEM THAT STARTS IN THE SCHOOLS. WHO IS -- STUDENT ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS THAT HAVE STANDARDS PROGRAMMATIC STANDARDS AND STANDARDS FOR OF THE SPECIALTY TRAINING OF THE COUNSELORS. WITH THAT'S WITH THE PRETREATMENT HAPPENS THAT'S WHERE THE EDUCATION THE PREVENTION AND THE AND THE EARLY INTERVENTION HAPPENS AND THEN WE NEED VERY CLOSE LIAISON WITH COMMUNITY BASED CENTRES. WHICH WILL DO THE ACTUAL TREATMENT THE EVALUATION TO SEE IF TREATMENTS NEEDED THE INTENSIVE OUTPATIENT TREATMENT THE ON GOING OUT PATIENT TREATMENT -- AND ESOS COMMUNITY CENTERS IT SHOULD HAVE SPECIAL LEAVE OUT REACH FOR SCHOOL DROPOUTS FOR TREATMENT DROP OUTS FOR HOMELESS YOUTH. WE NEED TO RECOGNIZE THAT A SYSTEM OF TREATMENT FOR ADOLESCENTS HAS TO BE SEPARATE AND DIFFERENT FROM ANY TREATMENT FOR FOR ADULTS WHY DOES IT HAVE TO BE DIFFERENT. FOR SAFETY PURPOSES -- IT PEOPLE EARLY IN ABSENCE WHO ARE FOURTEEN YEARS OLD AND IT CAN'T BE PUT TOGETHER WITH PEOPLE OR TWENTY TWO YEARS OLD WHO WERE -- EARLY IN ABSENCE THEY DON'T HAVE THE BEST BOUNDARIES SAFETY IS ONE MAJOR REASON WE NEED TO HAVE -- IT SEPARATE BECAUSE THE THE TREATMENT GOALS ARE DIFFERENT FOR USE YOUTH ARE. A LOT OF TIMES WHEN YOU'RE TWENTY TWO TO THE TREATMENT GOAL IS TO LAUNCH FROM YOUR FAMILY WHEREAS WHEN YOU'RE FOURTEEN IT'S TO RECOGNIZE YOUR DEPENDENCE UPON THAT FAMILY. WE HAVE TO HAVE MUCH MORE INTENSE FAMILY AND FROM OF TREATMENT IN ADOLESCENCE CENTERS BECAUSE A LOT OF THESE -- USE ARE IN FAMILIES WERE TRYING WAS NOT IN THE PAST IS HAPPENING CURRENTLY WE NEED HIGHLY SPECIALIZED TRAINING THAT YOU DON'T NEED TO HAVE IN ADOLESCENT. TO OUR I MEAN INTO DON'T TREATMENT BECAUSE YOU NEED TO BE SENSITIVE TO ALL OF THE PSYCHOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT IS HAPPENING IN ADOLESCENCE. I BELIEVE WE HAVE AN OBLIGATION WE HAVE A AN INDUSTRY RIGHT NOW WHICH IS LEGAL WHICH IS SELLING MARIJUANA. THAT INDUSTRY SHOULD BE OBLIGATED TO HELP PICK UP THE COST OF REMEDIATION FOR ANY DAMAGE DONE BY THEIR PRODUCT. AND THAT MEANS PROP SIXTY FOUR FUNDS ALONG WITH THE OTHER FUNDS NEED TO BE SIR OF NEED TO BE -- UNDER RATING PROGRAMS WHICH BY STANDARDS HAVE TO BE INTEGRATED INTO AN ON CONTINUUM OF CARE FROM SCHOOLS.
