PLEASE READ. ASSEMBLY BILL EIGHTY EIGHT BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER BURKE AN ACT RELATING TO TAXATION AND DECLARING THE URGENCY THERE OF SICK AFFECT IMMEDIATELY. SENATOR SKINNER THE FLOOR IS YOURS THANK YOU- MADAM PRESIDENT AND MEMBERS. AB AT IS THE. ACTION THAT WOULD ALLOW OUR BUSINESSES THAT HAVE RECIEVED PAYCHECK PROTECTION LOANS AND WHOSE LOANS WERE FORGIVEN IT WOULD ALLOW THEM TO HAVE TAX CONFORMITY- IN THEIR CALIFORNIA TAXES THIS BILL WAS HEARD IN OUR BUDGET COMMITTEE ON FEBRUARY EIGHTEENTH HOWEVER THE ACTION WAS DELAYED BECAUSE THERE WAS A PROVISION IN THE AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN ACT THAT COULD HAVE PUT BY OUR CALIFORNIA STATE A CALIFORNIA'S FEDERAL FUNDS AT RISK. SO WE FINALLY HAVE RECEIVED FEDERAL GUIDANCE THAT ALLOWS US TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS VERY IMPORTANT MEASURE TO ASSIST START BUSINESSES THAT HAVE BEEN IMPACTED BY THE CODE NINETEEN PANDEMIC. THE BILL HAS BEEN RECENTLY AMENDED THE PRIMARY DIFFERENCE IS THAT THE PRIOR VERSION CAPPED. THE AMOUNTS THAT BUSINESSES CAN DEDUCT FOR THE EXPENSES. THAT THE- EXPENSES USING FORGIVEN PPP LOAN SIR WAS CAPPED AT A HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND WE HAVE REMOVED THE CAP IN THIS BILL ALLOWS BUSINESSES TO DEDUCT ALL BUSINESS EXPENSES PAID FOR WITH THE PPP LOAN THAT WAS FORGIVEN EXCEPT FOR IF IT WAS IF IT IS DEEMED TO BE AN ILL ELIGIBLE ENTITY. ED IN ELIGIBLE BUSINESSES OR THOSE WHO DO NOT MEET THE REDUCTION IN GROSS RECEIPTS OF 25% OR MORE WHICH WAS A CONDITION OF THE SECOND ROUND OF THE PPP LOANS OTHERWISE THE BILL JUST MAKES A FEW CONFORMING CHANGES RELATED TO BOTH PPP LOANS AND ECONOMIC- INJURY DISASTER LOANS. AND THIS ACTION WILL PROVIDE OUR CALIFORNIA BUSINESSES BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN BENEFITS AND WITH THAT I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. IS THERE ANY DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THIS ITEM. WE NEED. TAKE A MINUTE. WHAT. SENATOR DOLLY. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT MEMBERS I JUST WANTED TO SAY I'M IN SUPPORT I CANNOT TELL YOU HOW MANY CALLS WE'VE HAD OUR OFFICE FROM PEOPLE TRYING TO PREPARE THEIR% TAXES- OBVIOUSLY THEY HAVE EXTENDED THE DEADLINE WHICH IS VERY HELPFUL BUT MANY OF BUSINESSES THAT ARE TRYING TO PREPARE- THIS IS TIMELY AND AYE ARJUN AYE VOTE ON THIS BILL AND THIS GET THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY ABLE DO THEIR TAXES AND GET BACK ON TRACK. THANK YOU. CENTER GROVE. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I KNOW THERE WAS A CONFUSION WITH THE- BOTH ADMINISTRATIONS THE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION HAD ALLOWED A THESE LOANS AND THEN THE ADMINISTRATION WE HAVE NOW HAD TO- RESTRICTIONS ON GUN STATES NOT BE ABLE TO REDUCE OUR TAXES AND I'M SO GRATEFUL THAT THE IS THAT THE SENATE PRO TEM THE BUDGET CHAIR WERE TO THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE WORKS REALLY HARD TO GET CLARITY OUT OF THE ADMINISTRATION IN WASHINGTON DC SO THAT WE CAN OFFER- DEDUCTIONS TO THE BUSINESSES THAT HAD APPLIED FOR THESE PPP LOANS- LIKE MY COLLEAGUE FROM BEAVER. MY PHONE WAS RINGING OFF THE HOOK BECAUSE PEOPLE WERE YOU KNOW SAID I WOULDN'T TAKE IT ALONE IF I KNEW I WASN'T GONNA GET THESE DEDUCTIONS AND THEY HAVE TO TAKE THAT LOAN KEEP THEIR EMPLOYEES EMPLOYED USE THAT MONEY FOR RESOURCES TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE STILL HAD A JOB AND WE'RE GOING TO BE DISASTROUS ET DE PROCESS AND THEN YOU HAVE TO PAY TAXES ON THAT MANY AT THE END WAS- YOU KNOW SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE WERE VERY UPSET ABOUT SOMEONE I THINK THE BUDGETARY FOR. MAKING SURE THAT THIS GOT RESOLVED% AND- IT JUST YEAH I. URGE A NO VOTE ON THIS BILL. SEEING NO FURTHER DISCUSSION- DEBATE. SENATOR WIENER. THANK YOU I'M PRESIDENT I ALSO- I'D URGE AND I GO AND I ALSO REALLY WANT TO THANK OUR BUDGET STAFF THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE TO ADDRESS IS REALLY A TEAM EFFORT- THESE BUSINESSES ARE HURTING SO BADLY AND- AND I JUST THINK THIS MAKES ALL THE SENSE IN THE WORLD PPP HAS ALWAYS BEEN EXTREMELY BIPARTISAN PROGRAM FEDERALLY IN HERE IN CALIFORNIA- WE ALL WANT THESE BUSINESSES TO SUCCEED THANK YOU. SENATOR PAN. THANK YOU AYE MADAM PRESIDENT CENTERS I TO STAND IN STRONG SUPPORT AND AGAIN REALLY APPRECIATE- THE WORK- THE OF OUR- BUDGETS- TEAMINDUS ARE BUDGET CHAIRS WALLS ARE PRO TALLMAN OR GOVERNOR MAKING THIS HAPPEN- IT WAS A SMALL BUSINESS OWNER OF THE AND ALSO CERTAINLY HEARING FROM A LOT OF SMALL BUSINESSES MANY BUSINESSES GOT TO KEEP THE LAWN SO TRY TO KEEP PEOPLE ON THE PAYROLL EVEN WHEN THEY DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH REVENUE TO REALLY SUPPORT THAT AND- WAS WE KNOW THE PDT LOANS REQUIRED YOU TO SPEND 60% OF THE LOAN ON PAYROLL ITSELF. SO P. AND REALLY APPRECIATE WERE ABLE TO DO THIS FOR THE BUSINESSES HERE IN CALIFORNIA I REALLY APPRECIATE. THE HARD WORK IT TOOK TO MAKE IT HAPPEN THANK YOU. SENATOR BATES. THANK YOU I TO RISE IN US SUPPORT OF THIS BUT JUST WANT TO PUT ON THE RECORD IN HOPE GOING FORWARD THAT DIED TWO OF THE CONCERNS RAISED BY THE COMBINATION OF THE CHAMBER THE BANKERS ASSOCIATION COUCH TAX IN THE APARTMENT ASSOCIATION WOULD BE CONSIDERED AS THE BILL MOVES FORWARD BECAUSE OTHERWISE IT WOULD LOOK ODD TO SOME DEGREE THAT THERE'S A FEW WINNER THERE'S A LOT OF WINNERS BUT IF YOU'RE A FEW LOSERS AND I THINK WE'RE IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT. THIS IS A REALLY FOR THE WHOLE BUSINESS SECTOR THAT HAS SUFFERED SO GREATLY DURING THE PANDEMIC NOW THEY THEIR EMPLOYEES IN PARTICULAR- SO HOPEFULLY THEY'LL TAKE A LOOK AT THAT AS IT MAKES ITS WAY THROUGH THE PROCESS THANK YOU. SENATOR HER. OF THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT- I TO RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL AND I THINK TO BE A PART TIME AND THE BUDGET CHAIR FOR HITTING CLARITY AND- MAKE IT WORK FOR OUR BUSINESSES ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IS THERE ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE. SENATE ROTH. THANK YOU WRITTEN THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT TO TALK ABOUT ALL THE TIME WERE BIPARTISAN SOLUTIONS ARE THE BEST SOLUTIONS IN THE LONGER LASTING AND HERE'S ONCE AGAIN EXAMPLE WHERE WE'VE ALL PULLED TOGETHER TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN TO HELP OUR SMALL BUSINESS PEOPLE I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE AND THANK MY COLLEAGUE FROM FRESNO BECAUSE REALLY HIS LEGISLATION SB TWO SIXTY FIVE WAS THE GENESIS OF THIS PROGRAM. IT TOOK THE GOVERNOR A LONG TIME TO GET TO GET TO WHERE I THINK THIS BODY WAS BUT HE ALMOST GOT THERE SO EVEN THOUGH THIS IS A THIS IS A GREAT EFFORT I THINK IT'S STILL FALLS A LITTLE SHORT BUT OBVIOUSLY WORTHY OF SUPPORT. J. AS WE MOVE FORWARD THIS CHAMBER HAS CONTINUED TO LEAD IS NOT AFRAID TO LEAD IN FACT RELISHES THE CHALENGE AND THAT'S THE GOVERNOR HAS MENTIONED THAT HE WANTS TO OPEN UP SOCIETY ON THE FIFTEENTH OF JUNE I REALLY BELIEVE IT'S NOW TIME FOR US TO TAKE A LOOK AT TERMINATING THIS EMERGENCY ACT I DON'T THINK WE NEEDED ANYMORE I THINK EVERY CALIFORNIA BENEFITS FROM HAVING A COMPLETE GOVERNMENT WHERE YOU HAVE THE PROPER CHECKS AND BALANCES- THAT IS LAID OUT IN THE CONSTITUTION. SO I HOPE- THE LEADERSHIP IN THIS HOUSE WILL- CONTEMPLATE MOVING S. C. R. FIVE FROM THE MY GOOD MY GOOD FRIEND FROM LAKE ELSINORE SO WE CAN AGAIN BE A CO EQUAL BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT AND WITH THAT I REGION. AYE VOTE FOR THIS MEASURE. SENATOR TO LET. THANK YOU MANAGER RIGHT TO RISE TO SUPPORT THIS BILL IT IS SO IMPORTANT TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THE BUSINESS OWNER SMALL BUSINESSES EVERY SINGLE DAY WE HEAR THE STORIES OF MOM AND POP NEEDING HELP THIS IS OUR WAY OF COMING TOGETHER IS A SENATE COMING TOGETHER AS A CITY CALIFORNIA SAY WE APPRECIATE YOUR PATIENCE AND NOW WE'RE TAKING THE BIG STEP FORWARD THEY SEE THAT WE CAN COME TOGETHER AS WE SURE WE HEARD THE TERM.

IMPORTANT MEASURE THAT WILL REALLY WILL HELP. IN IN OUR EFFORTS THE PANDEMIC HAS BEEN DEVASTATING. TO OUR COMMUNITY SAID. THAT IF WE CAN DO IS STEP. UP AND UP FOR THESE POLICIES THAT WILL HELP IN THIS AND THOSE EFFORTS. BUT THAT I ALSO ASTRONOMICAL THANK YOU. CENTER HERTZBERG. THANK VERY MUCH WHEN PRESIDENTS TO RISE IN SUPPORT AND GIVE MY- CONGRATULATIONS TO THE BUDGET CHAIR BUDGET TEAM IN BOTH HER OFFICE AND IN THE PRO TEM'S OFFICE AS WELL AS THE PROTON THIS IS REALLY AN ELEGANT SOLUTION TO- QUITE DIFFICULT CHALLENGES COSTS A LOT OF MONEY AND THANK GOD WE HAVE A LOT OF MONEY NOW IN CALIFORNIA FROM THE FEDS AND ALSO FROM THE- KANEMI THAT IS SURPRISINGLY OCCURRED HERE SO I'M JUST I THINK IT'S A QUITE PRACTICAL SOLUTION BY LOOKING AT THE PERCENTAGE RATHER THAN LOOKING AT CATEGORIES THAT WE HAD DISCUSSED BEFORE. VERY HAPPY TO SEE IT AND- ASK YOUR STRONG SUPPORTERS MEASURE. SENATOR AKOWSKI. THANK YOU MA'AM- PERSON I HAVE A QUESTION FOR THE AUTHOR- ALONG THIS LINE BECAUSE IN WHEN WE FIRST DID PPV OR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT THE PPP ONE IT WAS TO HELP KEEP BUSINESSES OPEN GIVE MONEY TO HARPER PAY FOR THE EMPLOYEES PREVENT THE ECONOMY FROM CRASHING YEAH THE DATA NOW WHEN THEY WHEN WE HEARD AB EIGHTY EIGHT WAS A HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS YOU KNOW EXCLUSION IF YOU MADE MORE THAN HAVE YOU COULD DEDUCT UP TO HUNDRED FIFTY NOT GOING WITH THE PERCENTAGE OF 25% UNDER PPP TWO- ARE WE ARE AT RISK OF HAVING MANY SMALL BUSINESSES. THAT HAVE A 19% LOSS OR AN 18% LOSS THAT THE THAT THAT BORROWED MONEY UNDER PPP ONE WILL HAVE TO I DO HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT INCOME AND IS. I GUESS FOR. WHAT DOES IT MINISTRY SAVE THAT. HE SAID THAT CENTER SKINNER WOULD YOU LIKE TO ADDRESS THAT IN YOUR CLOSING OR WOULD YOU LIKE TO ANSWER THAT RIGHT NOW. WHICHEVER YOUR PREFERENCES MADAM PRESIDENT. IF YOU COULD ANSWER IT RIGHT NOW IT LOOKS LIKE CENTER IT MIGHT COST IS NOT FINISHED SO LET'S OKAY NICE RIGHT NOW THEN WE CAN- SO THE SPECIFIC THAT- THE SENATOR FROM FOR YOUR OWN IS REFERRING TO IS THAT. THE WHAT MAKES A BUSINESS WHO MAY HAVE RECEIVED A LOAN IN ELIGIBLE FOR THIS DEDUCTION IS THE SAME CRITERIA THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ITSELF USED FOR THE USE RING OF LOANS IN THE SECOND ROUND WHICH IS THAT. THE BUSINESS WOULD HAVE HAD TO HAVE A LOT SHOWN A LOSS IN GROSS RECEIPTS OF 20% 5% OR HIGHER IN TWENTY TWENTY THAT'S COMPARED TO THE SAME TIME PERIOD IN TWENTY NINETEEN. SO IT DOES NOT MEAN THAT THE BUSINESS WOULD HAVE NECESSARILY HAD TO SHOW A- THE- REDUCTION IN GROSS RECEIPTS OF 25% OVER THE ENTIRE YEAR BUT RATHER FOR THE PERIOD. FOR WHICH THEY ARE CLAIMING SO- THERE ARE ESTIMATIONS ARE IT IT WELL IT DOES EXCLUDE SOME BUSINESSES IT'S A VERY SMALL NUMBER. THANK YOU SO MUCH IS THERE ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE. CENTER BURGESS. THANK YOU FOR THE PRESIDENT AND I DO WANT TO EXTEND MY- D. WAS APPRECIATION OF MY COLLEAGUES- WHO WERE HELPFUL IN ALLOWING ME TO BE HERE TODAY I THINK I. THINK I RAN A MILE LIKE SIX AFTER SEVEN MINUTES. THE VIRGINIA FROM A LOT OF BREATH. THIS IS WANTED TO WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR- LEGISLATIVE LEADERS COURSE THE BUDGET YEAR ON. PHOTO MACINNES AND ALL THOSE WHO SPEND TIME WORKING ON THIS BILL. SOME OF YOU MAY REMEMBER THAT. MY COLLEAGUE AND I FROM SALINAS INTRODUCED A BILL A LONG TIME AGO THE SEVENTY FOUR SB SEVENTY FOR THE KEEP CALIFORNIA WORKING AT. IT WAS DURING THAT THE CRAFTING OF THE BILL. THAT THE ISSUE OF WHAT WOULD BE A TAXABLE EVENT. WAS BROUGHT UP. AND UPON FURTHER INQUIRY WE REALIZE THAT. INDEED THERE WERE COMPONENTS OF FEDERAL FUNDING THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE ELIGIBLE FOR TAXABLE BE CONSIDERED TAXABLE EVENT. AND I THINK. BY INTRODUCING SB TWO SIX FIVE IN JANUARY. IN JANUARY- WE WERE ABLE TO EARN A LOT OF SUPPORT BECAUSE I THINK A LOT OF FOLKS JUST DIDN'T FEEL THAT WOULD BE. OTHERWISE FAIR. FOR EMERGENCY RELIEF FUNDING FROM THE FEDS. THE TAX AT THE STATE LEVEL. AND I THINK EVERYONE IN THIS ROOM INCLUDING THE LEADERSHIP AGREED WITH THAT WORKING WITH THE GOVERNOR AND OTHER FLKS THAT WE HAD THE KEY PROVISIONS OF TWO SIX FIVE CORPORATE INTO AB AT AND FOR THAT I'M- ABSOLUTELY GRATEFUL FOR. AND WE HAVE AN ONLINE PETITION IN THOUSANDS OF FOLKS SUPPORT. ALL THE SMALL BUSINESSES. AND ALL THE FOLKS WITHIN OUR DISTRICTS SO FOLKS WITHOUT FURTHER DELAY I AM ACTUALLY PLEASED TO SUPPORT AB EIGHTY AS EMERGENCY EARLY ACTION ITEM IN THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR EVERYONE WHO SUPPORTIVE OF THIS. PROCESS THANK YOU. SEEING NO FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE. CENTER SKINNER YOU MAY CONCLUDE THANK YOU VERY MUCH- JUST IS- TERMS OF SCALE IN CALIFORNIA THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PROVIDED NINETY SEVEN BILLION IN P. P. P. AND THE YEAH IDEA OR ECONOMIC INJURY DISASTER LOANS AND ABOUT IT WAS ABOUT A MILLION LOANS. AND THE AVERAGE WAS ABOUT. NINETY SIX THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED AND TWENTY EIGHT WAS THE AVERAGE LOAN. SO AS I MENTIONED THIS WOULD ALLOW FOR THE TAX CONFORMITY WITH A FEW EXCEPTIONS THAT I DESCRIBED AND APPRECIATE THE DISCUSSION WITHOUT AND THE FLOOR WITHOUT I ASK FOR YOUR I. BOOKED.

PLEASE READ. SENATE RESOLUTION SIX BY SENATOR SKINNER RELATIVE TO REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CENTERS SKINNER THE FLOOR IS YOURS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- MADAM PRESIDENT MEMBERS I'M PLEASED TO PRESENT S. C. R. SIX WHICH COMMEMORATES THE FORTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF THE U. S. SUPREME COURT'S RULING IN ROE VERSUS RAID. ROVERS'S WAIT A RULING THAT WAS ISSUED ON JANUARY TWENTY SECOND. NINETEEN SEVENTY THREE. IT WAS A LANDMARK RULING AND WHAT IT CAN CHANGE WHAT'S THE JUSTICES ASSERTION THAT THE FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT PROVIDES AND THE AMENDMENTS RIGHT TO PRIVACY THAT THAT RIGHT TO PRIVACY. PROTECTS A WOMAN'S RIGHT TO CHOOSE WHETHER OR NOT TO HAVE AN ABORTION. THE SUPREME COURT IN THAT RULING CLASSIFIED THE RIGHT TO CHOOSE THAT'S FUNDAMENTAL WHICH REQUIRED LOWER COURTS TO EVALUATE CHALLENGED ABORTION LAWS UNDER THE STRICT SCRUTINY STANDARD WHICH IS THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF JUDICIAL REVIEW IN THE UNITED STATES. KNOW THAT LANGUAGE WAS WEAKENED SLIGHTLY IN THE NINETIES WHICH OPENED THE DOOR TO THE LEGISLATIVE ATTACKS THAT WE NOW SEE BY MANY STATES WERE TRYING TO A ROAD THAT CHOICE. BUT FUNDAMENTALLY BOTH THE RULING AND A WOMAN'S RIGHT OVER HER REPRODUCTIVE CHOICES REMAIN. THE LAW OF THE LAND. BEFORE THAT RULING IN ROE VERSUS WADE ABOUT A MILLION WOMEN A YEAR IN THE UNITED STATES RESORTED TO ILLEGAL ABORTION ED WHICH LED THEN TO OVER FORTY FIVE THOUSAND ANNUAL DEATHS. NO ONE FORTUNATELY AS I REFERENCED DUE TO A WEAKENING OF THE RULING IN THE NINETIES. THERE HAVE BEEN MANY STATE ACTIONS TO TRY TO WEAKEN. BROUGH VERSUS WADE AND IN THE LAST EIGHT YEARS ALONE FOUR HUNDRED AND EIGHTY THREE NEW TATE LEVEL RESTRICTIONS HAVE BEEN ENACTED NOT ALL HAVE BEEN APPEALED BUT THAT SO MANY HAVE BEEN PASSED BY DIFFERENT LEGISLATURES. CLINIC VIOLENCE AND THREATS WHEN PROVIDERS ARE ON THE RISE. AARON IT IS MORE AND MORE DIFFICULT FOR WOMEN TO EXERCISE THEIR RIGHT DEPENDING ON WHERE THEY LIVE BECAUSE OF HAVING NO CLINIC ANYWHERE NEAR THEM. AS A REFLECT ON THIS ANNIVERSARY I THINK ABOUT THE CURRENT SUPREME COURT AND WHETHER THAT CURRENT MAJORITY WILL RESPECT THE WILL OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE THE ONE I REFERENCE THE WILL I MEAN. THAT POLLS AS RECENT AS AUGUST TWENTY NINETEEN SHOW THAT SEVEN IN TEN AMERICANS DO NOT WANT ROE VERSUS WADE OVERTURNED. AND IN FACT THE MAJORITY OF AMERICANS 59% HAVE INDICATED A GREATER CONCERN IS WITH STATES THAT ARE MAKING IT TOO DIFFICULT FOR WOMEN TO EXERCISE THEIR REPRODUCTIVE CHOICES. FORTUNATELY CALIFORNIA HAS A LONG HISTORY OF SUPPORTING A WOMAN'S PERSONAL DECISIONS REGARDING HER REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH INCLUDING ABORTION. AND WE HAVE EXPANDED ACCESS TO REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE BY MANDATING INSURANCE COVERAGE. FOR MANDATING INSURANCE COVERAGE AND ALSO EXPANDING THE LOW INCOME ACCESS FOR ABORTION SERVICES WE'VE ALSO EXPANDED ACCESS TO. MEDICATION ABORTION AT ALL UNIVERSITY HEALTH CENTERS. S. R. SIX REMINDS US THAT THE WORK OF ENSURING A WOMAN'S RIGHT TO CHOOSE IS NOT DONE. EVERY WOMAN DESERVES TO MAKE THIS DECISION FOR HERSELF EVERY WOMAN DESERVES FINANCIAL AND MEDICAL SUPPORT. AND I THINK WE ALL UNDERSTAND THAT GENDER EQUITY WILL REMAIN ELUSIVE UNTIL WOMEN HAVE FULL AGENCY TO DETERMINE THEIR REPRODUCTIVE DECISIONS AND FULL ABILITY TO ACCESS AND ACT ON THOSE DECISIONS. AND WITHOUT I ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS. SENATOR DOLLY. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT. I WATCH THIS RESOLUTION COMMON GOAL FOR THE PAST EIGHT YEARS AND I HAVE SAT SILENTLY. MY SILENCE HAS BECOME THE LOUDEST VOICE IN MY HEAD. THIS IS DEDICATED TO MY DAUGHTER ROSLYN ROSLYN YOUR SMILE BRIGHTENS MY DAY. YOUR LOVE FOR LIFE IS CONTAGIOUS YOUR BRAVE AND ELEVEN YEARS OLD YOU NEVER CEASE TO AMAZE ME. YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL AS YOUR DADDY I CAN'T WISH BUT THE YEARS WOULD SLOW DOWN. YOU ARE GROWING UP TOO QUICKLY. YOU ARE THE YOUNGEST ANNUAL FOREVER BE MY BABY GIRL. WHEN WATSON WAS BE INFORMED BY OUR CREATOR GOD IN HER MOTHER'S WOMB WE WERE TOLD THERE WAS NO HEARTBEAT AND THERE WASN'T A BABY IT WAS SIMPLY A POSITIVE A FALSE POSITIVE. BUT THE SONOGRAM SHOWED HER TINY FRAME. WE WERE PAINFULLY TOLD TO GET ARE NOT WE WERE PAINFULLY TOLD NOT TO GET OUR HOPES UP AND THE DNC WAS THE BEST CHOICE. THIS NEVER BECAME OUR TRUTH WE HELD ON YOUR HOPE AND TOLD OURSELVES TO WAIT TWO WEEKS. WHAT IF OUR BABY WAS THERE WHAT IF IT WASN'T A FALSE POSITIVE WHAT IF. TWO WEEKS LATER MY WIFE AND I WENT TO HER HER DOCTOR'S APPOINTMENT AND FOR THE FIRST TIME WE HEARD ROZ'S HEARTBEAT. WE CRIED OUR DOCTOR CRIED WITH THIS IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL MOMENT I STAND HERE TODAY AS A VOICE. A VOICE FOR THOSE WHO HAVEN'T LOST THEIR VOICE. A VOICE FOR THOSE WHO WILL NEVER GIVEN A CHANCE TO BE LOVED BY THEIR FATHER AND MOTHER. THE ONES WHO WILL NEVER KNOW WHAT THE FIRST DAY OF KINDERGARTEN IS LIKE. OR LEARN TO RIDE A BIKE. OR FOR THE ONE WHO WILL NEVER WALK DOWN THE AISLE WEDDING I'LL TODAY I STAND AS A VOICE FOR THE VOICELESS. HERE ARE A FEW STATISTICS ABORTION IS THE LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH WORLDWIDE KILLING MORE THAN FORTY TWO POINT SIX MILLION BABIES IN JUST TWENTY TWENTY ALONE HIGHER THAN AIDS CANCER MALARIA AND OTHERS COMBINED ACCORDING TO THE REPORT RELEASED BY WORLD METERS BASED ON THE WORLD HORSE HEALTH ORGANIZATION SUCH AS X. AS OF DECEMBER. THIRTY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY. IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE THERE HAVE BEEN TWELVE POINT FIVE MILLION ABORTIONS WORLDWIDE. THAT IS AN AVERAGE OF THREE MILLION ABORTIONS A MONTH AND APPROXIMATELY EIGHTY TWO THOUSAND A DAY. SOURCE WORLD- METERS WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION IN THE U. S. THERE ARE OVER THREE THOUSAND ABORTIONS PER DAY. 22% OF ALL PREGNANCIES IN THE U. S. EXCLUDING MISCARRIAGES IN AN ABORTION. CALIFORNIA IS ONE OF THE TOP TEN STATES FOR ABORTION RATES IN THE US. WE MUST CONTINUE TO FIGHT FOR BETTER SOLUTIONS. WE CAN DO BETTER WE MUST. WE HAVE A BUDGET SURPLUS. WE HAVE FUNDING TO PROVIDE GREATER EDUCATION AND EDUCATION AND POWERS. FOR THOSE REASONS AND MANY MORE MEMBERS I WILL NOT BE SUPPORTING THIS RESOLUTION TODAY THANK YOU. SENATOR GONZALEZ. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT AND I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO THE AUTHOR- FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD- THERE ARE STILL MANY BARRIERS TO ACCESSING ABORTION IN CALIFORNIA EVEN THOUGH WE ARE CONSIDERED A LEADING STATE IN THE FIGHT FOR A PRODUCTIVE FREEDOM AND ACCESS TO REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE WE STILL SO MANY BARRIERS IN ORDER TO CONTINUE TO LEAD THE WAY INTO TRULY UPHOLD THE VALUES THESE VALUES WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT ABORTION AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE SERVICES ARE ACCESSIBLE AND EQUITABLE TO ALL CALIFORNIANS NOT. ONLY ONLY THOSE WHO CAN AFFORD IT. THE ALL TOO SIMILAR FAMILIAR STATISTICS AND STORIES. PORTION ACCESS THIS IS THE GRIM REALITY OF INJUSTICE WHEN SYSTEMIC INEQUITY IS ALLOWED TO CONTINUE. IT IS PEOPLE OF COLOR TRANS NON BINARY PEOPLE PEOPLE IN RURAL COMMUNITIES PEOPLE OF. ALL ETHNIC BACKGROUNDS AND SOCIOECONOMIC BACKGROUNDS AS WELL THAT FACE THE WORST AND ARE SPECIALLY HARMED AS IT PERTAINS TO REPRODUCTIVE. HEALTH CARE ACCESS THE CONSEQUENCES ARE TOO. GREAT AND WHEN CABS CALIFORNIANS SHOULD UPHOLD THIS RIGHT. AND FOR THAT I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO SENATOR SKINNER AND IS A PROUD MEMBER OF THE WOMEN'S CAUCUS. I STAND IN SUPPORT OF THIS AND I HOPE MY COLLEAGUES WILL DO TO. SKINNER GROVE. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I WOULD AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUE FROM BEAVER THAT AND FOR YEARS WE'VE SAT SILENT ON THIS FLOOR AND NOT DEFENDED- DEARBORN WE'VE JUST VOTED NO ON THESE PARTICULAR PIECES OF LEGISLATION- WHEN ROE VERSUS WADE PAST THERE WASN'T THE TECHNOLOGY THAT WE HAD- THAT WE HAVE AVAILABLE TO US TODAY WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THE TECHNOLOGY THAT WE HAVE TODAY- I WAS BLESSED THIS PAST YEAR TO HAVE TWO GRAND BABIES BORN ON THE SAME DAY. EVERY SECOND AND WE GOT TO GO WATCH THEIR ULTRASOUNDS WHERE THEY HAVE THE NEW THREE D. AND FIVE D. VERSIONS AND THEY HAVE A PERSONALITY OF THEIR OWN EVEN AT TWENTY WEEKS TWENTY FIVE WEEKS THIRTY TWO WEEKS AND THEY SET THEIR THUMBS- WE GET TELL TYLER WAS GONNA HAVE LITTLE TINY LIVES LIKE YOUR DAD AND WE CAN HELP RALLY WAS GOING TO HAVE REALLY NICE BIG LIPS LIKE HER MOM HIS MOM. AND WE COULD TELL THAT PROBABLY WAS GOING TO BE LONGER AND PROBABLY WAY MORE THAN TYLER- BUT YOU KNOW COUSINS NONETHELESS IN WE COULD SEE THAT EACH ONE OF THEM HAVE THEIR OWN PERSONALITY EVEN INSIDE THEIR MOTHER'S WOMBS- THE REPORT IN FEBRUARY IT WAS THE RIGHT TO LIFE MEANT AND I POSTED A PICTURE BECAUSE BIRD ALLOWED IN THE HOSPITAL BECAUSE OF THE RESPONSE TO KOBE DIDN'T ALLOW PARENTS IN THERE. BUT MY SON IN LAW TOOK A PICTURE OF MY GRANDSON. TWO SECONDS MAYBE AFTER HE CAME OUT OF THE WHEN HE SAW THE UMBILICAL CORD ATTACHED. IT CAME OUT HIS HANDS. AND THEN HE WAS CRYING OF COURSE AND THEN. I CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE THAT. MY COLLEAGUES ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE AISLE THINK THAT. TEN SECONDS BEFORE THAT PHOTO. THAT THAT IS NOT A LIFE. TEN SECONDS BEFORE THAT PHOTO WAS TAKEN MY COLLEAGUES ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE AISLE SAY THAT THAT IS NOT A LIFE AND THE WOMAN HAS A RIGHT TO CHOOSE TO TERMINATE. THAT BABY. M. THINGS NEED TO CHANGE THINGS DEFINITELY NEED TO CHANGE THERE'S NEW TECHNOLOGY OUT THERE THAT SHOWS THAT THESE BABIES IN THE WOMB HAVE PAIN THAT THESE BABIES IN THE WOMB FEEL PAIN THIRTY- THAT THEY LEARN AND THEY DEVELOP THEIR OWN PERSONALITIES IT WAS JUST AMAZING TO ME LIKE I. WHEN THE OTHER KIDS HAVE THEIR BABYSITTING HAVE THIS TECHNOLOGY OUT THERE AND SO WAS THIS YEAR THIS PAST YEAR HAS BEEN JUST A LEARNING EXPERIENCE- I WAS ALWAYS IN PRO LIFE BUT- THIS PARTICULAR EXPERIENCE THIS LAST YEAR WHEN I WAS ABLE TO SEE THE SONOGRAMS OF THE FIVE D. PORTION. IT'S LIKE LOOKING AT A REAL PHOTOGRAPHS. OF THE BABY IN THE WOMB- I WOULD. ASK MY COLLEAGUES TO- TAKE A DEEP BREATH CAN SUPPORT THOSE THOSE YOUNG GIRLS THAT WILL NEVER BE BORN THOSE YOUNG BOYS THAT MAY HAVE A PROMISING FUTURE- THAT WILL HAVE A PROMISING FUTURE IF THEY WERE ABLE TO BE BORN. I WOULD LIKE YOU TO THINK ABOUT THE FOUNDING OF PLANNED PARENTHOOD AND HOW MARGARET SANGER AND HOW IT ACTUALLY STARTED AND WHERE THOSE SPECIFIC CLINICS ARE ACTUALLY LOCATED AND HOW THAT IS TRULY A RACIAL ISSUE. AND I WOULD ASK YOU TO VOTE NO ON THIS PARTICULAR PIECE OF LEGISLATION. THANK YOU. SENATOR MELENDEZ. GOOD TO GO THERE WE GO THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT- I WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUES WHO HAVE SPOKEN IN OPPOSITION TO THIS RESOLUTION PARTICULARLY MY COLLEAGUE FROM BEAVER I THOUGHT THOSE WERE VERY POIGNANT REMARKS TO MAKE. TO HIS DAUGHTER. OKAY SORRY YOU'RE LOOKING AT ME AS THOUGH THERE'S A PROBLEM MY APOLOGIES- MY OWN DAUGHTER HINO SHE'S EIGHTEEN NOW AND SHE'S GOING TO BE GOING OFF TO COLLEGE AND I HOPE THAT- SHOULD SHE EVER FIND HERSELF IN A POSITION WHERE SHE'S. PREGNANT AND WASN'T PLANNING ON BEING PREGNANT THAT SHE FALL BACK ON. WHAT SHE WAS TAUGHT IN THE HOME WHICH SHE WAS TAUGHT IN HER CHURCH THAT EVERY- WITH THE LIFE IN THE WOMB GOD HAS CREATED AND TO TAKE THAT INTO CONSIDERATION I DON'T. I FEEL AS THOUGH AFTER HAVING BEEN IN THE LEGISLATURE NOW FOR ALMOST TEN YEARS THAT. IS IF THERE IS AN EFFORT FOR CALIFORNIA TO BE NUMBER ONE IN. IN PROVIDING THE MOST NUMBER OF ABORTIONS IN THE COUNTRY I DON'T THINK THAT THAT'S SOMETHING WE SHOULD BE STRIVING TOWARD I DON'T THINK PUSHING POLICIES. THAT TAKE THE LIFE OF AN IS AN INNOCENT CHILD THOSE AREN'T VALUES. THOSE ARE NOT VALUES. WE TALK ALL THE TIME IN THESE CHAMBERS ABOUT. THE VALUE OF A LIFE THE SANCTITY OF THE LIFE. AND I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY DOT MINDSET DOESN'T APPLY WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AN UNBORN CHILD. ABORTION. PUSHING POLICIES THAT MAKE IT EASIER TO GET AN ABORTION TO MAKE IT CHEAPER TO GET AN ABORTION TO MAKE THEM MORE ABUNDANT THOSE ARE NOT VALUES I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR DON'T VOTE THANK YOU. THERE ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE. SEEING NONE SENATE- SENATOR WIENER. THANK YOU ROAD SHOWS TO PRESENT I RISE IN STRONG SUPPORTER OF AS OUR SIX YEAR PEOPLE CAN HAVE WHATEVER PERSONAL VIEWS- THEY WANT TO HAVE ABOUT ABORTION AND WHAT MAKES SENSE OF WHAT A WOMAN BELIEVES MAKE SENSE FOR HER AND HER LIFE AND- THOSE ARE ALL OPINIONS AT EACH PERSON AS AN INDIVIDUAL HIGHS- BUT THE ISSUE HERE. IS WHETHER WOMEN HAVE THE AGENCY AND THE INDEPENDENCE AS HUMAN BEINGS TO MAKE CHOICES ABOUT THEIR OWN BODIES AND ABOUT THEIR OWN LIVES. AND FRANKLY IT'S NONE OF MY BUSINESS. WHETHER WOMAN DECIDES SHE WHETHER SHE WANTS TO GET PREGNANT WHETHER SHE WANTS TO CARRY TO TERM THAT IS HER CHOICE AND HER CHOICE. ALONE AND WE HAVE MOVED PAST THE POINT IN TIME NOT EVERYWHERE IN THE WORLD BUT WE SAY WE MOVED PAST IN THIS COUNTRY. THE POINT IN TIME WHERE WOMEN WERE VIEWED AS PROPERTY OF THEIR HUSBANDS OR THEY WERE SUBSERVIENT IN SOCIETY AND THEY JUST HAD TO DO WHAT THEY WERE TOLD- THAT'S NO LONGER. THE CASE IN THIS COUNTRY AND I HOPE ONE DAY AROUND THE WORLD- AND IF A WOMAN CAN MAKE REPRODUCTIVE CHOICES FOR HERSELF AND CONTROL HER OWN BODY AND CONTROL THE TIMING OF WHETHER AND WHEN- SHE HAS A CHILD. THEN THERE IS NO WAY THAT WE CAN HAVE THAT FULL INDEPENDENCE AGENCY AND EQUALITY. SO I ASKED FOR AN AYE VOTE. SENATOR BRADFORD. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I TO RISE IN SUPPORT AND I'M KIND OF MIXED HERE BECAUSE PERSONALLY. I BELIEVE IN LIFE IN PRO LIFE. BUT I. WHOLEHEARTEDLY INSTEAD FAST BELIEVE IN A WOMAN'S RIGHT TO CHOOSE A WOMAN'S RIGHT TO DO WITH HER BODY AS SHE SEES FIT. THEY MANY TIMES WHEN INDIVIDUALS CHOOSE TO HAVE AN ABORTION IT'S NOT JUST SIMPLY THE TERMINATOR PRESENT A PREGNANCY IT MIGHT BE BECAUSE OF HEALTH COMPLICATIONS BOTH FOR THE WOMAN AND THE FOETUS- BUT THERE ARE TIMES WHEN IT'S ONE OF. MATURITY. THEIR ABILITY TO RAISE A CHILD THE FINANCIAL WORLD WERE ABOUT TO PROVIDE FOR THAT CHILD AND I GUESS MY REAL ROB HERE IS THAT. THOSE WHO ARE STILL PRO LIFE IN THE WOMB.% WELL THE FIRST ADVOCATE FOR DEATH OF THAT SAME INDIVIDUAL ONCE THEY BECOME A TEAM AND THEY CROSS THE LINE. SO YOU CAN'T BE PRO LIFE IN THE WOMB N. M. PRO DEATH ONCE THEY BECOME AN ADULT SO ON THAT REASON AND THOSE REASONS HI SCOTT FOR AYE VOTE. SENATOR KAMLAGER. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I RISE IN SUPPORT OF SR SIX- I YOU KNOW I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE FOCUS THIS DISCUSSION ON HEALTH EQUITY AND HEALTH ACCESS. ACHIEVING HEALTH EQUITY REQUIRES FINDING THE SYSTEMIC RACISM THAT CREATES BARRIERS TO ALL KINDS OF SEXUAL AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE. WE HAVE SEEN FROM THIS PAST YEAR THAT THE PANDEMIC HAS LAID BARE SO MANY RACIAL DISPARITIES IN HEALTH CARE. BUT WE CAN ALSO SEE WHO IS MOST AFFECTED. BY INCREASED ABORTION RESTRICTIONS AND IN SKYROCKETING SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASE GREAT. WE ARE CONTINUING TO FACE RELENTLESS ATTACKS ON OUR ABILITY TO KEEP PROVIDING SEXUAL AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE YES INCLUDING ABORTION. AND THOSE ATTACKS EQUATE THE SILENCING OF WOMEN. WOMEN ARE NOT A MONOLITHIC GROUP. WOMEN SHOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO CHOOSE WHAT THEY WANT TO DO WITH THEIR BODIES AND HOW THEY WANT TO LIVE. N. AS WE FIGHT SO OFTEN TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ALL HAVE A RIGHT. WHY DOES IT SEEM TO BE OKAY. TO DENY THE RIGHTS OF WOMEN TO MAKE CHOICES ABOUT HOW WE WANT TO LIVE. THERE WAS A REALLY GREAT OP ED. IN LAST WEEK'S NEW YORK TIMES WRITTEN BY ALEXIS MCGILL JOHNSON THE CURRENT EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR PLANNED PARENTHOOD- ACTUALLY QUITE ELOQUENTLY TALKS ABOUT. PLANNED PARENTHOOD'S FOUNDING AND ITS FOUNDER. AND NO LONGER EXCUSES. THE VALUES AND BEHAVIOR OF THAT PARTICULAR PERSON. EUGENICS WRONG AFFILIATING WITH THE KLU KLUX KLAN WRONG. CENTRALIZING BLACK AND BROWN IN IMMIGRANT WOMEN WRONG. BUT FOCUSING ON BODILY AUTONOMY AND SELF DETERMINATION FOR WOMEN IS SOMETHING QUITE FRANKLY WE ALL SHOULD BE SUPPORTING. FINN ABORTIONS ARE NOT ONE IN THE SAME. MANY FOLKS HAVE THEM BECAUSE WHAT'S GROWING INSIDE OF THEM STOPS GROWING. IT STOPS GROWING. AND THOSE DECISIONS THAT WOMEN HAVE TO MAKE. ARE PROBABLY THE ONE DECISION THEY NEVER WANT TO HAVE TO MAKE. BUT IT IS ABOT THE HEALTH OF THE MOTHER. AND THE FACTTHAT THERE IS SOMETHING INSIDE OF THAT MOTHER TO BE OR MOTHER WHO WANTED TO BE. THAT IS NOT TO GROWING. THAT SCIENCE. AND UNFORTUNATELY IT IS LIFE. SO I WOULD JUST URGE US. TO NOT CONTINUE TO SUGGEST THAT WOMEN ARE SECONDS. AND THAT THE RIGHT FOR US TO DETERMINE HOW OUR BODIES ARE TREATED IN WHO HAS CONTROL OVER THEM. IT'S NOT SECONDS. AND THAT WE SUPPORT ORGANIZATIONS AND CLINICS VETERAN COMMUNITY IS QUITE FRANKLY THAT NO ONE REALLY CARES ABOUT UNTIL IT'S EXCITING. TO ALLOW THOSE ORGANIZATIONS AND COMMUNITY CLINICS TO PROVIDE CARE THAT OFTEN TIMES NO ONE ELSE IS PROVIDING. SO I ASK. WE SUPPORT SELF DETERMINATION AND BODILY AUTONOMY AND A WOMAN'S RIGHT TO CHOOSE AND THINK AND MAKE DECISIONS FOR HERSELF BY SUPPORTING SR SIX THANK YOU. SENATOR WEST OF. THANK YOU AMONG A MOMENT EVEN THOSE NUMBERS IT DOESN'T HAVE MY OWN LIKE SO. I'D LOVE TO SHARE THE- THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO MAKE A FEW COMMENTS HERE AND I JUST WANT TO SHARE MY OWN PERSONAL PERSPECTIVE ON THIS MATTER AS A- AS A LATINO CATHOLIC. WHO HAS OFTEN BEEN ASKED HOW DO I RECONCILE HAS A CATHOLIC MY POSITIONS ON. ON ALLOWING A WOMAN'S CHOICE. AND THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT IS OFTEN RAISED BEEN SOMEBODY PERSONALLY. THAT SUPPORTS LIFE SUPPORTS- IT I'M NOT I'M PERSONALLY OPPOSED TO ABORTION TRULY. AND THAT'S AN AREA WHERE I OFTEN STRUGGLE. BUT I LOOK AT THIS FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF WHAT IT REALLY IS I OFTEN I I'VE BEEN HERE FOR YEARS HEARING ARGUMENTS HOW BLESSED GOVERNMENT IS MORE. AND- FROM FROM ONE SIDE OF THE AISLE OFTEN SAYS LESS GOVERNMENT IN YOUR LIFE IS BETTER WE WANT FREEDOM. AND THEN WHEN I HEAR HOW THEY ARGUE FOR MORE GOVERNMENT. IN DETERMINING INDIVIDUAL FAMILY PLANNING I CAN'T RENTS ARE RECONCILED THAT THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE TO ME. AND WITH THIS REALLY TRANSLATES TO. IS IT WILL YOU KNOW WHEN WE TALK ABOUT IMPOSING LAWS ON LOCAL GOVERNMENT THAT'S CALLED AN UNFUNDED MANDATE. THIS IS THIS IS AN UNFUNDED MANDATE ON ON WOMEN'S LIVES. A GOVERNMENT DECIDES YOU HAVE TO HAVE. CHILDREN BUT DOES NOTHING. TO SUPPORT THE UPBRINGING OF THOSE CHIP CHILDREN. BACKED UP BY AN IDEOLOGY OF PEOPLE THAT SAY. WE SUPPORT LIFE BEFORE IT'S BORN BUT WON IT ONCE IT'S BORN. WE DON'T SUPPORT IT ANYMORE. LET THOSE CHILDREN LIVE IN POVERTY. LET THEM LIVE IN INEQUALITY WITHOUT EQUAL ACCESS TO DRINKABLE WATER WITHOUT EQUAL ACCESS TO QUALITY EDUCATION. AND I'VE BEEN HEARING HERE NOT ELEVEN YEARS. DEBATING PROVIDING. EQUAL OPPORTUNITY FOR THE PEOPLE OF OUR STATE. AND JUST TRYING DOT TRYING TO UNDERSTAND HOW SOMEBODY ON THE- ONE HAND COULD SUPPORT. LIFE BEFORE IT'S BORN BUT ONCE IT'S BORN. NOT SUPPORTED AT WHEN. IT'S MOST APPROPRIATE THIS IF YOU REALLY LOOK AT WHAT THIS IS. THIS IS GOVERNMENT CONTROL OF FAMILY PLANNING THE GOVERNMENT SAYING YOU MUST HAVE A CHILD AND WE WILL HAVE NOTHING TO DO. HOW THAT CHILD IS RAISED WHETHER IT'S PROVIDED WITH A LITTLE HOME HEALTH CARE EDUCATION. THAT'S WHERE WE'RE AT BUT YOU HAVE TO HAVE THAT CHILD BUT I WANT TO SEND YOU WITH ONE THOUGHT TODAY AS- WELL AFTER THIS VOTE WE COULD PROBABLY GUESS HOW THE SPORT'S GONNA. TURN OUT. WELL I WOULD LIKE TO SEND EVERYONE WITH A FIVE. IS THAT A FORM OF SLAVERY. GOVERNMENT SAYING TO WOMEN YOU MUST DO THIS YOU MUST DO THAT. WITHOUT YOUR CHOICE SOMETHING THAT SIGNIFICANT IS GIVING BIRTH AND RAISING A CHILD THE GOVERNMENT SAYING YOU MUST DO THAT. IS THAT ANOTHER FORM OF SLAVERY IN ARE WE DEBATING. ANOTHER FORM OF SLAVERY HERE IN THE SENATE FLOOR. PLEASE SUPPORT S. R. SIX. SENATOR PAN. I THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT- SENATORS- I RISE IN SUPPORT OF S. R. SIX AS A POSITION- WHICH RECOGNIZES THE IMPORTANCE OF REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH AND MARKS THE FORTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF THE SUPREME COURT DECISION ROE VERSUS WADE A GOOD FOR SO I JUST POINT OUT SINCE I'M GENERALLY A DIVIDEND SPACE TO A POLICY MAKER THAT ACTUALLY- HERE IN CALIFORNIA- OUR POLICIES- FOR THOSE WHO SAY THEY WANT TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF ABORTIONS ACTUALLY HAS BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL. SHE REDUCE THE PORTIONS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BY OVER 60% SINCE THE EARLY NINETEEN NINETIES. SO I HAVE YOU KNOW WHEN PEOPLE ACTUALLY WANT TO TALK ABOUT SOME WE REALLY ABOUT REDUCING ABORTIONS YOU SHOULD BE DEFINITELY FULLY IN SUPPORT OF- ACCESS TO CONTRACEPTION- MANY OTHER POLICIES WELL THAT WE HAVE PURSUED HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF ABORTIONS. HOWEVER I ALSO POINT OUT AND I KNOW THAT- THAT OTHER SEPARATE POINT ON THE FLOOR THAT IS A POSITION I THINK THAT. MIGHT COME TO HEALTH CARE- THAT SHOULD REALLY BE A DECISION BETWEEN THE- PATIENT AND THE DOCTOR INDIVIDUAL THE DOCTOR. ABOUT THEIR OWN HEALTH AND- YOU KNOW PEOPLE HAVE DIFFERENT BELIEFS. THEY AND THE IT'S TAKEN STATION SINCERELY FOLLOW THEIR OWN BELIEFS BUT THEN THE QUESTION IS DO WE AS GOVERNMENT IMPOSE- THESE RULES TO RESTRICT PEOPLE'S PERSONAL CHOICES ESPECIALLY THOSE CHOICES DON'T AFFECT. THE HEALTH OF THE PEOPLE AROUND THEM. AND- SO. I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT- WE SHOULD NOT BE INTERFERING IN THIS WAY IN THE PRIVATE PERSONAL DECISIONS OF WOMEN. THAT EVERY PERSON HAS THE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT TO MAKE THEIR OWN REPRODUCTIVE DECISIONS THAT INCLUDES ACCESS TO REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH NOW INCLUDES ABORTIONS WHICH IS HEALTHCARE. AND SO CERTAINLY I THINK THAT FOR THOSE WHO WANT TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF ABORTIONS WE SHOULD CONTINUE SUPPORT POLICIES THAT WE PURSUED HERE TO SEE THE CALIFORNIA WHICH HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN DOING SO. AND CERTAINLY WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT OUR CONSTITUTION. CONTINUES TO PROTECT THE PRIVACY. OF THE PEOPLE OF THE WHOLE COUNTRY THE EXPOSITION OF ROE VERSUS WADE. RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT PRESS ARE SIX THANK YOU. IS THERE ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE. SINGMAN CENTER SKINNER YOU MAY CONCLUDE. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT. THESE TOPICS I SUPPOSE SOME OF US MAY AT TIMES WANT TO SKIRT BRINGING FORWARD CONTROVERSIAL ISSUES- AND HAVING DISCUSSIONS THAT ARE VERY PERSONAL VERY SENSITIVE AND FOR MANY VERY EMOTIONAL. BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO SOMETIMES HAVE THESE DEBATES BECAUSE. WHAT I WOULD ASSERT IS THAT WE CAN NO WAY. FOR TO UNDERSTAND. WHY WHAT GOES THROUGH ONE'S MIND WHAT ARE THE FACTORS THAT INFLUENCED HER DECISION. WHEN SHE CHOOSES EITHER TO PROCEED WITH THE PREGNANCY OR TO ABORT. AND THAT IS REALLY WITH THE BRILLIANCE AND IMPORTANCE OF THE COURT'S RULING IS IN ROE VERSUS WADE. IS THAT IT GAVE WOMEN. AGENCY OVER THEIR BODIES AGENCY OVER THEIR REPRODUCTIVE CHOICES IT DOES NOT IMPOSE ABORTION. IT DOES NOT IMPOSE THAT SOMEONE PROCEED WITH THE PREGNANCY RATHER IT GIVES THE WOMAN THE WOMAN THE ABILITY TO DECIDE. NOW IT IS INTERESTING. THE EVOLUTION OF THE POLITICAL VIEWPOINTS ON THIS ISSUE. IN FACT IT IS THE REPUBLICAN PARTY THROUGHOUT THE SIXTIES AND PART IN GOOD PART OF THE SEVENTIES. WHO WAS OVERALL FAR STRONGER PRO CHOICE THAN THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY. THAT OBVIOUSLY HAS REVERSED ITSELF SOME OVERTIME. BUT THE ISSUE FOR ME IT'S NOT AN IDEOLOGICAL ISSUE. MY STRONG BELIEF IN A WOMAN'S RIGHT TO HAVE AGENCY OVER HER BODY AND HER REPRODUCTIVE CHOICES HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH ALL IDEOLOGY IT'S ABOUT PERSONAL EXERCISE IN THE SAME WAY. THAT WE DO NOT AS A GOVERNMENT IMPOSED INTERFERENCE ON THE EXERCISE OF PERSONAL CHOICE REGARDING ONE'S RELIGIOUS VIEWS. OR EVEN ONES POLITICAL VIEWS. THE CIRCUMSTANCES FOR WHICH A PERSON MAY A WOMAN MAY CHOOSE TO HAVE AN ABORTION MAYBE THAT THEIR HEALTH IS IMPACTED IT MAY BE THE CIRCUMSTANCES FOR WHICH THEY GOT PREGNANT. OR MAYBE ANY OTHER NUMBER OF THINGS. BUT THAT IS THE WOMAN'S RIGHT. AND THAT WAS THE PURPOSE OF THE RULING AND WHY IT CITED THE FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT WHICH WAS THE PRIVACY AMENDMENT. AND IT IS SOMETHING THAT AMERICANS AS I CITED EARLIER STILL STRONGLY BELIEVE AND HOLD. AND WITH THAT I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE ON S. R. SIX. MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL.
