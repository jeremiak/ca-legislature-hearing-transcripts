INSTEAD OF ELIMINATING IT

01:22:13.995 --> 01:22:14.963
ALTOGETHER I THINK THAT

01:22:15.030 --> 01:22:15.930

AGAIN AND IT LOOKS LIKE THAT IT

01:23:46.087 --> 01:23:46.855
WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT WOULD

01:23:46.921 --> 01:23:48.923
BE SUPPORTABLE FOR REPUBLICANS

01:23:49.124 --> 01:23:50.158

THE LANGUAGE IT'S UNCOMFORTABLE

01:24:50.084 --> 01:24:51.386
TO EVEN MAKE A DECISION BUT

01:24:51.453 --> 01:24:53.288
WHEN YOU READ THE CHEST OF WHAT

01:24:53.354 --> 01:24:55.457
THE INTENT IS IT SEEMS LIKE IT

01:24:57.025 --> 01:24:58.259
I SAID WE HAVEN'T SEEN ANY

01:24:58.326 --> 01:24:59.561
LANGUAGE AND IT'S REALLY HARD

01:24:59.627 --> 01:25:00.829
FOR US TO VOTE ON BILLS THAT

01:25:00.895 --> 01:25:03.898

MANY JUST SKIP OVER THE DMV

01:25:31.993 --> 01:25:33.127
I THINK WE ALL BELIEVE THAT'S

01:25:33.194 --> 01:25:35.230
A DISASTER IT'S AMAZING TO ME

01:25:35.296 --> 01:25:36.531
THAT WE'VE SPENT SEVEN HUNDRED

01:25:36.598 --> 01:25:37.832

A FEW YEARS AGO WHEN THERE IS

01:25:41.736 --> 01:25:42.770
A DIFFERENT ADMINISTRATION A

01:25:42.837 --> 01:25:43.538

THIS AGENDA FOR FUTURE YEARS

01:25:57.252 --> 01:25:58.253
I JUST THINK THAT PEOPLE WILL

01:25:58.319 --> 01:25:59.554
GO THROUGH THE NORMAL PROCESS

01:25:59.621 --> 01:26:00.855
OF THEIR FIVE YEAR FOR YOUR

01:26:00.922 --> 01:26:02.891

01:26:02.957 --> 01:26:05.260
ISSUED -- BEFORE THEY HAVE TO

01:26:05.326 --> 01:26:06.361
DO ANY ADDITIONAL STUFF FOR

01:26:06.427 --> 01:26:08.363
REAL ID'S SO IT DOESN'T THAT

01:26:08.429 --> 01:26:09.531
DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE TO ME

01:26:09.597 --> 01:26:10.865
AND I GUESS I I JUST WANT YOU

01:26:10.932 --> 01:26:11.833
TO KNOW I'M LOOKING AT IT FROM

01:26:11.900 --> 01:26:13.635
A BUSINESS STANDPOINT IF MY

01:26:13.701 --> 01:26:14.802
CONTRACT WAS GOING TO RENEW

01:26:14.869 --> 01:26:16.037
IN THREE YEARS I WOULDN'T

01:26:16.104 --> 01:26:17.405
NEED A FIVE YEAR EXTENSION IN

01:26:17.472 --> 01:26:18.740
ORDER TO APPROVE THE CONTRACT

01:26:18.806 --> 01:26:19.774

RENEWED ON A NATIONAL BASIS

01:26:21.776 --> 01:26:25.280
SO I HOPE THAT MAKES SENSE AND

01:26:28.416 --> 01:26:29.183
AND THEN THAT CAN BE A

01:26:29.250 --> 01:26:30.051
CONSIDERATION BECAUSE

01:26:30.118 --> 01:26:31.486
THAT SAVES TAXPAYERS SEVEN

UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IS GOING

01:28:08.816 --> 01:28:10.585
