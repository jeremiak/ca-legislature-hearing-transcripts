01:02:16.833 --> 01:02:17.967
DEVELOP POLICIES THAT WILL

01:02:18.034 --> 01:02:20.736
PREVENT FUTURE MEGA FIRES. THE

EVEN STOP IT ONCE IT STARTS IT

01:05:27.723 --> 01:05:29.392
BECOMES A LIFESAVING MISSION

01:05:29.458 --> 01:05:30.593
NOT A FIRE SUPPRESSION THAT

01:05:30.660 --> 01:05:32.595
MISSION. SO IF YOU'RE NOT

01:05:32.662 --> 01:05:33.362
GETTING ON TOP OF THE FUEL

01:05:33.429 --> 01:05:35.264
REDUCTION IF YOU'RE NOT DOING

01:05:35.331 --> 01:05:37.333
SOMETHING ABOUT FUEL YOU'RE NOT

01:05:37.400 --> 01:05:41.137
SOLVING THIS PROBLEM. SO

01:05:41.203 --> 01:05:41.737
HUNDRED EIGHTY HUNDRED EIGHTY

01:05:41.804 --> 01:05:43.372
MILLION BUT THE REST OF IT IS A

01:05:43.439 --> 01:05:46.642
LOT OF SMOKE AND MIRRORS. AND

01:05:46.709 --> 01:05:48.444
LET'S FACE IT WE DON'T NEED

01:05:48.511 --> 01:05:52.014
ANYMORE SMOKE. IN CALIFORNIA

01:05:52.081 --> 01:05:53.416
AND THAT'S WHAT WE'VE HAD

01:05:53.482 --> 01:05:55.785
MYCOLOGIST TALKED ABOUT THE

01:05:55.851 --> 01:05:56.352
CARBON EMISSIONS FROM THESE

01:05:56.419 --> 01:05:58.020
FIRES THEY- THEY COMPLETELY

01:05:58.087 --> 01:06:01.023
DWARF. THE REDUCTIONS THAT

01:06:01.090 --> 01:06:04.260
WE'VE MADE ON CARBON. AND STILL

01:06:04.327 --> 01:06:12.401
WE JUST. WELL DOWN ON THE MONEY.

01:06:12.468 --> 01:06:13.869
AND WE NEED TO REDUCE THE

01:06:13.936 --> 01:06:17.406
BUREAUCRATIC. RED TAPE THE GETS

01:06:17.473 --> 01:06:18.507
IN THE WAY OF DOING PROJECTS

01:06:18.574 --> 01:06:20.743
SEEK WAS A PROBLEM SYKORA

01:06:20.810 --> 01:06:22.011
STANDS IN THE WAY OF DOING

01:06:22.078 --> 01:06:25.581
THESE PROJECTS WE DID THIRTY

01:06:25.648 --> 01:06:26.215
FIVE UNDER THE GOVERNOR BECAUSE

01:06:26.282 --> 01:06:27.817
THE GOVERNOR. PUSH FOR

01:06:27.883 --> 01:06:30.186
STREAMLINED PROJECTS WE DID

01:06:30.252 --> 01:06:31.654
THIRTY FIVE OF THEM. WE DON'T

01:06:31.721 --> 01:06:32.755
KNOW HOW MANY MORE ARE GOING TO

01:06:32.822 --> 01:06:34.724
BE DONE UNDER THIS BILL. THERE

01:06:34.790 --> 01:06:35.691
STILL HAS BEEN NO STREAMLINING

01:06:35.758 --> 01:06:37.493
THAT'S ANOTHER ISSUE THAT NEEDS

01:06:37.560 --> 01:06:39.495
TO BE ADDRESSED. I HAVE

01:06:39.562 --> 01:06:41.664
LEGISLATION ON THAT FRONT. THAT

01:06:41.731 --> 01:06:43.032
I WOULD HOPE THAT THIS BODY

01:06:43.099 --> 01:06:43.866
WOULD PASS BECAUSE IF YOU HAVE

01:06:43.933 --> 01:06:46.102
THE MONEY. BUT YOU DON'T HAVE

01:06:46.168 --> 01:06:46.669
THE ABILITY TO MOVE FOR WITH

01:06:46.736 --> 01:06:49.638
THE PROJECT. WHICH IS EXACTLY

01:06:49.705 --> 01:06:51.073
WHAT HAPPENED IN BERRY CREEK

01:06:51.140 --> 01:06:52.808
THIS YEAR. THEY HAD THE MONEY.

01:06:52.875 --> 01:06:53.776
PREPARE TO MOVE FOR THE

01:06:53.843 --> 01:06:55.711
PROJECT. AND HOW TO DO A FULL

01:06:55.778 --> 01:06:56.946
ANOTHER SEQUEL REVIEW AND IT.

01:06:57.012 --> 01:06:58.981
PUT THEM OUT EIGHTEEN MONTHS

01:06:59.048 --> 01:07:02.051
THE FIRE CAME THIS YEAR. IF WE

01:07:02.118 --> 01:07:03.152
DON'T DO SOMETHING ABOUT

01:07:03.219 --> 01:07:05.354
STREAMLINING SEEK WERE. SO THAT

01:07:05.421 --> 01:07:07.123
WE CAN DO THESE PROJECTS AND WE

01:07:07.189 --> 01:07:09.158
CAN DO THEM TIMELY. AND THE WE

01:07:09.225 --> 01:07:10.926
CAN INCREASE THE PACE AND SCALE

01:07:10.993 --> 01:07:13.295
WE'RE NOT. SOLVING THE PROBLEM

01:07:13.362 --> 01:07:14.497
SO I HOPE THAT TODAY IS NOT

01:07:14.563 --> 01:07:16.732
JUST. HEY WE SOLVED IT PAT EACH

01:07:16.799 --> 01:07:20.035

01:07:21.837 --> 01:07:25.207
WE'RE DONE. THERE'S A LOT MORE

01:07:25.274 --> 01:07:26.809

WASN'T SIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR

01:16:41.496 --> 01:16:43.832

COPING. SO WELL THERE WAS MONEY

01:16:54.743 --> 01:16:56.812
IN THE BUDGET UNFORTUNATELY

01:16:56.878 --> 01:16:58.547
THERE WAS A POLICY THAT WAS

01:16:58.613 --> 01:16:59.781
EITHER IN THE BUDGET OR PASSED

01:16:59.848 --> 01:17:01.717
BY THIS LEGISLATURE WERE SIGNED

01:17:01.783 --> 01:17:03.418

THIS BILL HAS A NUMBER OF

01:17:10.792 --> 01:17:11.793
PROVISIONS THAT ARE DIFFERENT

01:17:11.860 --> 01:17:14.696
FROM AB THIRTY TWO SIXTEEN OF

01:22:08.790 --> 01:22:11.026
TO THE SENATE CAME BACK. THEY

01:22:11.092 --> 01:22:14.462
GOT OUT WITH FORTY FOUR VOTES.

01:22:14.529 --> 01:22:16.798
THERE IS A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF

01:22:16.865 --> 01:22:19.067
OPPOSITION. TO THIS PARTICULAR

01:22:19.134 --> 01:22:21.436
PIECE OF LEGISLATION. THE

01:22:21.503 --> 01:22:22.337
BUDGET CHAIR IN HIS COMMENTS AT

01:22:22.404 --> 01:22:24.372
THE BEGINNING. MENTIONED THAT

01:22:24.439 --> 01:22:26.441
THIS WAS A POLICY. THERE WAS

01:22:26.508 --> 01:22:28.276
MONEY IN THE BUDGET BUT THE

01:22:28.343 --> 01:22:30.745
POLICY WASN'T THERE ADMITTING.

01:22:30.812 --> 01:22:34.949
THIS IS A POLICY BILL. WE HAVE

01:22:35.016 --> 01:22:35.483
NOT RAN THIS BILL THROUGH

01:22:35.550 --> 01:22:38.286
POLICY THIS YEAR. THIS BILL HAS

01:22:38.353 --> 01:22:40.288
AN EMERGENCY CLAUSE ON IT'LL GO

01:22:40.355 --> 01:22:43.058
AFFECTED ME DEEPLY. BUT BECAUSE

01:22:43.124 --> 01:22:45.293
WE'RE USING THE BUDGET PROCESS.

01:22:45.360 --> 01:22:46.728
WE DON'T HAVE TO DO THAT WE GET

01:22:46.795 --> 01:22:49.664
THAT WITH A SIMPLE MAJORITY.

01:22:49.731 --> 01:22:51.499
FRIENDS THIS IS INCREDIBLY

01:22:51.566 --> 01:22:56.237
PROBLEMATIC. EMPLOYEES HAVE THE

BURDEN. TO PUT THE FEES. THE

01:23:12.020 --> 01:23:15.190
FINES THE LIABILITY ON THE

01:23:15.256 --> 01:23:17.592
EMPLOYEE ON EMPLOYERS RATHER.

01:23:17.659 --> 01:23:19.027
IT'S UNACCEPTABLE SO YOU HAVE

01:23:19.094 --> 01:23:21.763

01:23:36.378 --> 01:23:37.679
LITIGATION COMES AFTER THAT.

01:23:37.746 --> 01:23:39.514

BUSINESS TO ME THAT THIS WILL

01:23:40.982 --> 01:23:43.251

01:36:10.064 --> 01:36:11.665
RIGHT. THAT'S WHY IT'S

01:36:11.732 --> 01:36:14.068
IMPORTANT BECAUSE WE HAVE A

01:36:14.135 --> 01:36:17.071
GROUP OF WORKERS WHO HAVE BEEN

01:36:17.138 --> 01:36:18.405
UNEMPLOYED UNEMPLOYMENT

01:36:18.472 --> 01:36:19.807
HOPEFULLY ON UNEMPLOYMENT

01:36:19.874 --> 01:36:20.708
BECAUSE WE DON'T HELD WELL

01:36:20.774 --> 01:36:22.309
THAT'S BEEN GOING. WE DON'T

01:36:22.376 --> 01:36:24.311

01:36:30.384 --> 01:36:32.686
BACK WITH THEIR EMPLOYER. IN A

01:36:32.753 --> 01:36:34.922
WAY THAT'S REASONABLE IN A WAY

01:36:34.989 --> 01:36:36.557
THAT WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO

01:36:36.624 --> 01:36:38.726
AGAIN. HAVE A GOVERNMENT AGENCY

01:36:38.792 --> 01:36:42.196
PROVIDE. A CHECK AGAINST OF THE

01:36:42.263 --> 01:36:42.796
MEASURE THAT THIS BILL GETS

01:36:42.863 --> 01:36:44.932
IMPLEMENTED. WE ALL KNOW WHAT

01:36:44.999 --> 01:36:46.233
HAPPENS WHEN WE DO BILLS WITH

01:36:46.300 --> 01:36:47.001
THERE'S NO ENFORCEMENT

01:36:47.067 --> 01:36:48.802
MECHANISM WHEN THERE'S NOBODY

01:36:48.869 --> 01:36:50.871
WATCHING IT'S SELECTIVELY.

01:36:50.938 --> 01:36:55.209
IMPLEMENTED SO AGAIN. THESE ARE

01:36:55.276 --> 01:36:57.178
AGAIN LOW WAGE WORKERS THESE

01:36:57.244 --> 01:36:57.978
ARE NOT PEOPLE WHO GET PAID A

01:36:58.045 --> 01:37:00.548
LOT OF MONEY THESE ARE FOLKS

01:37:00.614 --> 01:37:02.216

THEY'RE UNDER THE CURRENT BILL.

02:01:29.148 --> 02:01:30.316
IS CLEAR AND CONVINCING

02:01:30.383 --> 02:01:31.417
EVIDENCE ALTHOUGH WE ARE

02:01:31.484 --> 02:01:32.518
WORKING WITH OUR SPONSORS ARE

02:01:32.585 --> 02:01:33.786
STAKEHOLDERS TO LOOK AT

CHANGING THAT STANDARD. TO SORT

02:01:37.490 --> 02:01:38.924

02:01:38.991 --> 02:01:40.993
CONCERNS HAVE BEEN RAISED HERE.

02:01:41.060 --> 02:01:42.261
AND THE INITIAL NOTION OF THE

02:01:42.328 --> 02:01:43.696
CLEAR AND CONVINCING IS WE'RE

02:01:43.763 --> 02:01:46.032
HOLDING KIDS AND YES WE ARE

02:01:46.098 --> 02:01:48.000
TALKING ABOUT KIDS WHO ARE

02:01:48.067 --> 02:01:50.469
POTENTIALLY. GUILTY OF IT'S A

02:01:50.536 --> 02:01:52.371
VERY SERIOUS CRIMES ARE THEY

GOING TO BE NONCUSTODIAL ARE

02:01:54.407 --> 02:01:56.409

02:01:58.244 --> 02:02:01.113

02:02:01.180 --> 02:02:03.249
THESE ARE KIDS HOWEVER WHO

02:02:03.315 --> 02:02:05.518
FEDERAL PROBATION FOR TWO.

02:02:05.584 --> 02:02:07.687
THREE YEARS BECAUSE THEY'RE

02:02:07.753 --> 02:02:09.955
GUILTY OF SHOPLIFTING. BECAUSE

02:02:10.022 --> 02:02:12.458
THERE TRUANT THAT'S REALLY WHAT

02:02:12.525 --> 02:02:14.260
WE'RE TRYING TO CHANGE AND SO

02:02:14.326 --> 02:02:16.595
YES A COURT IS GOING TO HAVE TO

02:02:16.662 --> 02:02:17.129
REVIEW THAT CASE AFTER SIX

02:02:17.196 --> 02:02:20.132
MONTHS. AND IF THERE'S A REASON

02:02:20.199 --> 02:02:21.901
BECAUSE THEY'RE IN REHAB.

02:02:21.967 --> 02:02:23.969
BECAUSE THEY'RE DOING A

02:02:24.036 --> 02:02:26.639
RESTITUTION PROGRAM. BECAUSE

02:02:26.706 --> 02:02:27.573
THEY ARE WORKING WITHIN THE

02:02:27.640 --> 02:02:29.241
COMMUNITY BASED ON THE TERMS OF

02:02:29.308 --> 02:02:31.677
THEIR PROBATION. COULD THAT GET

02:02:31.744 --> 02:02:34.480
EXTENDED FOR THESE VERY VERY

02:02:34.547 --> 02:02:36.916
SERIOUS CRIMES. ABSOLUTELY

02:02:36.982 --> 02:02:39.251
THAT'S HOW THE BILL'S DESIGN.

02:02:39.318 --> 02:02:41.487
THAT'S WHY THE CONDITIONS THAT

02:02:41.554 --> 02:02:44.056
ARE BEING CREATED IN THIS BILL.

02:02:44.123 --> 02:02:46.258
THE PROBATION CONDITIONS HAVE

02:02:46.325 --> 02:02:48.861
TO BE WHAT IS SPECIFIC TO THAT

02:02:48.928 --> 02:02:52.064
CHILD. INTO THAT CIRCUMSTANCE

02:02:52.131 --> 02:02:54.033
SO WE DON'T HAVE THE CASE WHERE

02:02:54.100 --> 02:02:56.001
SOMEONE HAS COMMITTED A MINOR

02:02:56.068 --> 02:02:58.337
OFFENSE. AND HAS VERY VERY

02:02:58.404 --> 02:02:59.939
SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF CONDITION

02:03:00.005 --> 02:03:02.341
PROBATION CONDITIONS PUT ON

02:03:04.443 --> 02:03:06.345
GUARANTEEING THAT THERE THAT

02:03:06.412 --> 02:03:09.215
THEY WILL FAIL. AND NO THERE IS

02:03:09.281 --> 02:03:10.683
NOT A DISCUSSION THIS IS A

02:03:10.750 --> 02:03:12.318
BLACK OR BROWN KID OR THIS IS A

02:03:12.384 --> 02:03:14.954
KID FROM THE ZIP CODE SO

02:03:15.020 --> 02:03:16.288
THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE MORE.

02:03:16.355 --> 02:03:17.523
PROBATION CONDITIONS PUT ON

02:03:17.590 --> 02:03:19.959
THEM THE FACTS OF THE MATTER

02:03:20.025 --> 02:03:22.161
ARE HOWEVER IF IT IS A BLACK OR

02:03:22.228 --> 02:03:24.764

02:03:26.899 --> 02:03:28.801
CONDITIONS PUT ON THEM. THAT'S

02:03:28.868 --> 02:03:31.937
A FACT IS THAT BLATANT RACISM.

02:03:32.004 --> 02:03:34.406
IS IT SORT OF. A BLATANT

02:03:34.473 --> 02:03:36.008
ATTEMPT TO GO AFTER CERTAIN ZIP

02:03:36.075 --> 02:03:37.810

02:03:37.877 --> 02:03:40.379
INHERENT RACISM ABSOLUTELY.

02:03:40.446 --> 02:03:41.514
THAT'S REALLY WHAT'S AT STAKE

02:03:41.580 --> 02:03:43.249
IN THAT WITH THIS BILL AND

02:03:43.315 --> 02:03:43.883
THAT'S WHY WE'RE TRYING TO TAKE

02:03:43.949 --> 02:03:45.751
THE RESEARCH. AND TRYING TO

02:03:45.818 --> 02:03:47.987
TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT THESE KIDS

02:03:48.053 --> 02:03:50.156
ARE GOING THROUGH HOW THEY'RE

02:03:50.222 --> 02:03:52.858
BEST SERVED WITHIN PROBATION

THEY CAN BE. A PROPERLY

02:03:57.963 --> 02:03:59.632
SUPERVISED HAVE APPROPRIATE

02:03:59.698 --> 02:04:01.801
CONDITIONS PUT ON THEM BASED ON

02:04:01.867 --> 02:04:03.202
THE SEVERITY OF THE CRIME.

02:04:03.269 --> 02:04:05.304
BASED ON THE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT

02:04:05.371 --> 02:04:07.506
THEY FIND THEMSELVES IN. AND

02:04:07.573 --> 02:04:09.175
BUILD SOME BETTER CONSISTENCY

02:04:09.241 --> 02:04:10.209
ACROSS THE STATE COUNTY TO

02:04:10.276 --> 02:04:13.245
COUNTY. SO IF A CHILD IS GUILTY

02:04:13.312 --> 02:04:14.980
OF THE WORST OF THE WORST OF

02:04:15.047 --> 02:04:16.949
THESE HEINOUS CRIMES AS AS AS

02:04:17.016 --> 02:04:18.717
BEEN DETERMINED. THERE ARE

02:04:18.784 --> 02:04:20.886
APPROPRIATE MECHANISMS IN PLACE

02:04:20.953 --> 02:04:21.620
TO ENSURE THAT THEY ARE HELD

02:04:21.687 --> 02:04:24.089
ACCOUNTABLE. AND THAT THEY ARE

02:04:24.156 --> 02:04:26.158
GOING TO SERVE. WHATEVER

02:04:26.225 --> 02:04:27.526
PUNISHMENT WE FEEL IS

02:04:27.593 --> 02:04:30.863
APPROPRIATE. BUT TOO OFTEN

02:04:30.930 --> 02:04:33.065
THESE ARE MINOR OFFENSES AND

02:04:33.132 --> 02:04:34.767
THESE KIDS ARE TREATED THE SAME

02:04:34.834 --> 02:04:36.302
AS IF THEY ARE A VERY SERIOUS

02:04:36.368 --> 02:04:38.537
OFFENDERS THAT'S THE PIECE WE

02:04:38.604 --> 02:04:39.905
HAVE TO GET OUT FROM UNDERNEATH

02:04:39.972 --> 02:04:42.274
HERE AND ENSURE THAT THOSE

02:04:42.341 --> 02:04:44.009
TERMS OF PROBATION ARE

02:04:44.076 --> 02:04:46.512
APPROPRIATE THAT THEY'RE

02:04:46.579 --> 02:04:48.647
ACTUALLY BEING REVIEWED. ON A

02:04:48.714 --> 02:04:50.416
SIX MONTH BASIS SO THAT THEY

02:04:50.482 --> 02:04:52.484
DON'T JUST LANGUISH FOR TWO OR

02:04:52.551 --> 02:04:53.152
THREE YEARS BECAUSE AND THIS IS

02:04:53.219 --> 02:04:55.754
WHAT HAPPENS. COURTS HEAD DOOR

02:04:55.821 --> 02:04:57.089

02:04:57.156 --> 02:04:59.091
ANOTHER YEAR OR FOR TWO YEARS

02:04:59.158 --> 02:05:00.526
OR THE PROBATION SYSTEM JUST

02:05:00.593 --> 02:05:02.494
ONCE HAS THEM CYCLING ON

02:05:02.561 --> 02:05:04.730

DRESSED WHATEVER UNDERLYING

02:05:08.200 --> 02:05:10.069
ISSUE THERE IS THAT'S WHY THIS

02:05:10.135 --> 02:05:12.171
MAKES SENSE IT IS BASED ON THE

02:05:12.238 --> 02:05:14.974
RESEARCH IT IS BASED ON HOW WE

02:05:15.040 --> 02:05:17.276
ARE RESPONSIBLE TO OUR KIDS.

02:05:17.343 --> 02:05:19.178
AND IT IS INTENTIONALLY

02:05:19.245 --> 02:05:20.846
DESIGNED THIS WAY TO START TO

02:05:20.913 --> 02:05:23.883
UNDO. THE INHERENT RACISM THAT

02:05:23.949 --> 02:05:25.517
