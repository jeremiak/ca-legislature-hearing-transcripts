ALL RIGHT THEN LET'S CALL OF THE P. YOU SEE. WE'VE GOT A SERIES OF SPEAKERS FINANCE MISTER BROWN FROM THE ELIO. COME FOR THIS WILL BE ITEM NUMBER. SIX OR WHAT ELSE IS EIGHT ISSUE [inaudible] EIGHT YOU SEE [inaudible] CATCHER. I MIGHT ADD [inaudible] YES [inaudible] AND TO SINCE I HAVE PRACTICED BANKRUPTCY LAW FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS THERE'S LIKE A HANDFUL OF PEOPLE THAT HANDLE THE TELE THESE SO. I HAVE A ONE THE PASSING INTEREST OF THE TWENTY EIGHT MILLION THAT'S BEEN REQUESTED HERE SO PLEASE BEGIN. THE CPC IS REQUESTING SORRY. BECAUSE THE SENATORS. I'M JEFF DRIVEN SIDE FROM THE LEGAL DIVISION OF THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION. AND BERNARD AS A VIA THE A DIRECTOR FOR ADMINISTRATION WITH THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION -- WE HAVE SEVERAL SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS HERE TODAY TO PRESENT OUR REQUEST AND ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THE COMMITTEE MAY HAVE. OUR FIRST ITEM ON FOR DISCUSSION IS ISSUE NUMBER EIGHT PC RESPONSE TO THE UTILITY BANKRUPTCY WHICH WILL BE PRESENTED BY MR DRIVEN STYLE.

AND AUDIT POSITIONS WHICH WILL BE PRESENTED BY MISS ANGIE WILLIAMS. OUR FIFTH ITEM IS ISSUE NUMBER TWELVE THE DECENTRALIZATION OF THE P. UC SACRAMENTO AND LOSS OF LOS ANGELES OFFICES WHICH I WILL PRESENT. AND FOR MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC ALL THESE MATTERS THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION IS THE WHOLE -- HOLD THEM OPEN SO I WILL HAVE THE PUBLIC HEARING AT THE% CONCLUSION OF ALL -- OF THE P. YOU SEE ITEMS PLEASE PM. THANK YOU JEFF -- SENATORS. JUST DRIVEN SIDE. FOR THE PC. THE CPC IS REQUESTING FUNDING FOR LEGAL SERVICES CONTRACTS TO ADDRESS THE P. JEANNIE BANKRUPTCY AND RELATED MATTERS. THE AMOUNT OF FUNDING IS TWENTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS OVER THREE YEARS. THE LEGAL SERVICES CONTRACT IS AN UNANTICIPATED COST FOR ADVICE AND REPRESENTATION ON RESTRUCTURING FINANCING. AND BANKRUPTCY MATTERS. THE CPC IS AN IMPORTANT STATE PARTY WITH STANDING AND A SIGNIFICANT ROLE TO PLAY IN THE P. GINNY BANKRUPTCY CASE. WE SET P. GENIES RATES AND WE OVERSEE THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL STRUCTURE. WE EVER SEE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF SERVICE AND THE COMPANY'S OPERATIONS INCLUDING ISSUANCES OF DEBT. EQUITY AND USE OF UTILITY PROPERTY AS COLLATERAL. WE ALSO IMPLEMENT IMPORTANT PUBLIC POLICY INITIATIVES AND PROGRAMS SUCH AS CLEAN ENERGY. ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE. ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND PUBLIC PURPOSE PROGRAM. TO FILL THIS ROLE WILL P. GENIE IS IN BANKRUPTCY THE CPC MUST HAVE FUNDS IN ITS BUDGET TO PAY FOR EXPERT REPRESENTATION. IN BANKRUPTCY COURT. OUR COUNCIL MUST ALSO BE ABLE TO RELY ON AN EXPERT ADVISOR. TO EVALUATE COMPLEX FINANCIAL CONDITIONS. AND ALSO TO MONITOR AND REPORT BACK ON THE FLOW OF INFORMATION IN THE CAPITAL MARKETS. THIS WILL ALLOW OUR COUNCIL TO PROVIDE ADVICE AND EFFECTIVE REPRESENTATION TO THE PC. I CAN CONTINUE WITH GENERAL COMMENTS ON THE CONTRACTS OR MOVE TO TAKING QUESTIONS IT'S WHATEVER WORKS FOR THE COMBINED LIKE FREE THEY HAVE A DIFFERENTIATIONBETWEEN BANKRUPTCY WORK. AND REGULAR LEGAL WORK THE YOU KNOW SITTING P. YOU SEE RATES TERMS AND CONDITIONS. YOU KNOW THE ISSUANCE OF DEBT. THEY'RE GONNA GO FOR BANKRUPTCY APPROVAL WHILE YOU HAVE -- THAT IS GOOD IF YOU HAVE A SECONDARY ROLE AS FAR AS THE THAT IS THE THE COURT HAVING APPROVAL OF THAT AND IN YOUR THE CLEAN ENERGY PROGRAM SURE ENERGY EFFICIENCY THAT GOES ON NOT WITHSTAND THE FACT THAT THEY HAVE A DEBTOR POSSESSION ACCOUNT. SO I GUESS WHAT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT IS WHAT DID YOU KNOW THIS IS A REORGANIZATION OF THE CREDITORS AT THE PC'S NOT A CREDITOR. YOU SEE IS A CREDIT CARD OKAY SO WHEN THAT LIMITED ROLE THAT YOU HAVE A CLAIM. YOUR ATTORNEY WILL FILE A CLAIM. THE COURT WILL ACCEPT THE CLAIM OR NOT ACCEPT THE CLAIM THAT'S NORMAL BANKRUPTCY CLAIM WORK BUT THAT'S NOT. TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF ADVICE -- IT THROUGH THE THROUGH. THE DEBTOR IS GOING TO BE PROPOSING THEIR PLANNED PC THAT SOME PROPOSED TO DO A PLAN RIGHT THERE TO REVIEW THE PLAN. BUT THEY'RE NOT THE PROPOSED A PLAN. THE LAST TIME THE P. THE P. GINNY WAS A BACK UP TO THE PC DID PROPOSE A PLAN. SO YOU'RE ANTICIPATING THAT THE P. YOU SIS GOT A PROPOSED A PLAN I MEAN THIS IS THIS IS ROUND TO IT. I'M JUST SAYING THAT WAS IN. THAT WAS AN UNUSUAL ALL UTILITIES ARE UNUSUAL REORGANIZATIONS RIGHT SO LET'S LET'S PUT IT THERE I JUST. YOU KNOW I I WANT THE PUBLIC TO FEEL CONFIDENT THIS IS THE SECOND REQUEST BY THE ADMINISTRATION MINISTRATION ASK FOR TWENTY MILLION FOR IN HOUSE. YOU KNOW FOR THE FOR THE GOVERNOR TO HAVE INFORMATION SORT OF A BANKRUPTCY ONE A ONE EIGHT AND ADVICE BUT BUT THE DEBTOR IS THE IS THE ENTITY THAT PROPOSES THE PLANT YOU WERE. AND I GUESS I'M TRYING TO DETERMINE WHAT. WHEN IT COMES TO SETTING RATES WHAT WOULD BE THE THETHE ADDED VALUE FOR THE FOR THE -- THE P. YOU SEE WITH THE LEGAL TEAM. SO I THERE'S A LOT TO IMPACT AND LIKE TO KIND OF YOUR QUESTION INTO SEVERAL DIFFERENT CATEGORIES. IN TERMS OF THE ROLE OF THE PCS REGULATOR. AND THE ROLE OF THE BANKRUPTCY COURT NOW THE P. GENIES IN BANKRUPTCY I THINK THE BEST WAY TO CONCEPTUALIZE THAT IS THAT THE COURT. AND THE P. UC NEED TO WORK SIDE BY SIDE. HE JENNY IS THE DEBTOR IN POSSESSION THAT MEANS THAT THEY ARE RUNNING THEIR COMPANY. THERE'S NOT A TRUSTEE RUNNING THE COMPANY FOR THEM. AND THEY NEED TO SEEK BANKRUPTCY COURT APPROVAL FOR MOST OF THE ACTIONS THAT THEY TAKE RUNNING THE COMPANY. CORRECT THE MILLER EARLY THERE A REGULATED UTILITY. AND THEY NEED. TO MAKE SURE THAT THE P. UC APPROVALS THAT ARE NECESSARY FOR THEM TO TAKE THE ACTIONS TO CONDUCT THEIR BUSINESS. ALSO ARE PROVIDED IN THE LAST BANKRUPTCY THERE WAS A CONCERN THAT THE UTILITY WAS TRYING. TO ONLY HAVE THE BANKRUPTCY COURT PROVIDE THE APPROVALS FOR ITS ACTIONS AND TO CUT OUT THE P. YOU SEE ONE OF THE REASONS WHY WE NEED. TO APPEAR N BANKRUPTCY COURT WITH EXPERT COUNSEL IS SO THAT WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT THE BANKRUPTCY COURT. PROCESS IS NOT DISPLACING THE REGULATORY PROCESS SO WE CAN DO. OUR JOB REGULATING UTILITY IT CERTAINLY THIS IS JEFF BROWN TO A JUDGE DENNIS MONTALE HE KNOWS THAT HE HEARD ALL THOSE ARGUMENTS YOU'RE NOT GONNA NEED COUNSEL TO SPEND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO CONVINCE HIM ABOUT THE ROLE OF THE P. YOU SEE WE'VE LEARNED SOMETHING. IN THE IN THE EIGHTEEN YEARS WHAT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT AND WE'RE GONNA HOLD IT IS THAT SOME OF THE WORK THAT THE DEBTOR IN POSSESSION COULD DO WAS ORDINARY THEY HAVE A HUNDRED TWENTY DAYS. TO ACCEPT LEASES AND AND EXECUTORY CONTRACTS ARE THERE THERE [inaudible] TERMINATED RIGHT. I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE ROLE OF THE P. YOU SEE WOULD BE ON A LEASE AGREEMENT THAT. P. JEANNIE HAS IN FRESNO JUST PICK IN PICKING OUT THEIR MEAN THAT'S GOING TO BE WORKED THAT THEY'LL DO BUT HOW THAT AFFECTS% THE OPERATION. I MEAN IT DOES HAVE SOME EFFECT ON THE OPERATION BUT AS FAR AS A THE P. YOU CEASE ROLE I'M. CHALLENGED I GUESS THEY MAY BE IF IF THERE MAY BE AN EXPONENT OF EXPLANATION BY SAID THERE'S SOME ORDINARY MONTHLY OPERATING REPORTS ARE FILED YOU KNOW WHETHER THIS COUNCIL'S GETTING. CLEAN OVER THE MONTHLY OPERATING REPORTS. YOU KNOW I MEAN THE US TRUSTEE DOES THAT ROLE YES YOU'RE RIGHT THERE IS A LOT OF ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS THAT OCCURS IN THE BACK OF THE CARD. IN ADDITION HOWEVER THE BANKRUPTCY PROCESS IS A COLLABORATIVE PROCESS. THIS IS NOT AN ADVERSARY PROCEEDING WHERE TWO LAWYERS ARE GOING TO GET UP AND FIGHT IT OUT IN FRONT OF THE JUDGE. THE CREDITORS COMMITTEE THE EQUITY HOLDERS COMMITTEE THE TORT CLAIMS CLAIMANTS COMMITTEE THE DEBTOR IN POSSESSION ARE ALL GOING TO WORK COLLABORATIVELY. TO DEVELOP A PLAN. P. GINNY HAS EXCLUSIVITY IN TERMS OF PROPOSING A PLAN FOR A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF TIME. AND THEN THAT EXCLUSIVITY WILL AND EVEN EVEN THEN P. GENIE IS GOING TO NEED TO WORK WITH ALL OF THE PARTIES. TO DEVELOP A PLAN THAT WILL ALLOW IT TO EXIT THE P. U. C. NEEDS TO HAVE SOPHISTICATED COUNCIL AN EXPERT FINANCIAL ADVISORS SO IT CAN GET IN ON THE GROUND FLOOR. AND WORK WITH THOSE FOLKS WERE DEVELOPING CAJUN HIS EXIT PLAN RATHER THAN SIMPLY WAITING ON THE SIDELINES FOR A PLAN TO BE DEVELOPED AND THEN PRESENTED TO THE PEACHES REGULAR COMMISSION RECORDS ON DO. THE CHALLENGE THAT WE HAVE IS THAT THE DEAD YOUR OWN ADMISSION YOU WERE A REDITOR I DON'T KNOW IF THE CREDITORS COMMITTEE I THOUGHT I READ THAT THE BEEN FORMED ALREADY. I DON'T KNOW BUT THE EQUITY HOLDERS COMMITTEE BUT THOSE AND THAT IS CERTAINLY THE DEBTOR IN POSSESSION THOSE PROFESSIONALS ARE APPROVED BY THE BANKRUPTCY COURT AND SUBJECT TO THE BANKRUPTCY COURTS REVIEW ON THEIR THEIR THEIR FEES. ARM WE'RE THE ONLY PEOPLE THAT ARE ARE HAVE THE OVERSIGHT OVER OVER THIS YOU'RE NOT GOING TO SUBMIT YOUR OR THE ATTORNEY WHOEVER WE HIRE HERE FOR TWENTY EIGHT MILLION. THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE SCRUTINIZED BY THE BANKRUPTCY COURT OF WHETHER THE WORK THAT THEY DID WAS IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF THE CREDITORS OR POP OR CONTINUE THE YOU KNOW THE THE BENEFIT OF THE THE REORGANIZATION YOU JUST HAVE US. YOU KNOW BE IN WORKLOAD AND I DON'T KNOW IF WE'RE GOING TO DO THIS EVERY SIX MONTHS GO OVER THE PLAN -- THE THE THE BILLING SECTOR DOING TO SEE THAT THEY'RE DOING THIS. THE STATE'S WORK IN REPRESENTATION. YOU SEE WHITE MY DILEMMA BECAUSE WE HAVE A JUDGE THAT'S LOOKING OVER EVERYBODY ELSE IS ALL THE OTHER PROFESSIONALS WORKING ON HERE WE'RE IT'S A COLLABORATIVE PROCESS BUT WE DON'T HAVE. THE JUDGE LOOKING OVER HOW MUCH MONEY THAT P. YOU SEIZE ATTORNEYS JUST SPENDING. IN THE LAST P. GINNY BANKRUPTCY WE DID END UP GOING TO THE COURT FOR SOME OF OUR EXPENDITURES AND SO THE JUDGE DID REVIEW IT. BUT I THINK THAT PIECE THE EXPENDITURES OF THE PC IS PROPOSING ARE IN LINE WITH THE EXPENDITURES OF ALL OF THE OTHER PARTIES IN THE PRECEDING. P. JEANNIE PROPOSED TO SPEND ABOUT TWENTY FOUR MILLION FOR THE FIRST THIRTEEN WEEKS ONLY THEY SPENT THREE MILLION SO FAR. THAT'S WHAT WE KNOW THE EXPENDITURES OF WE'RE PROPOSING HERE ARE TWENTY EIGHT MILLION WHICH COMPARES TO TWENTY FOUR MILLION FOR THE LAST P. JEANNIE BANKRUPTCY WHICH IS ABOUT THIRTY MILLION. IN TODAY'S DOLLARS. WE LOOKED AT THE HOURLY FEES THAT THE COUNCIL IS PROPOSING AND COMPARED IT WITH THE REQUESTS FOR FEES THAT WERE MADE AND OTHER LARGE BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDING SUCH AS THE SEARS PROCEEDING. AND THE HOURLY FEES ARE COMPARABLE. WE ALSO HAVE ARRANGED WITH OUR COUNSEL IF WE'RE ABLE TO MAKE PROMPT PAYMENT THERE IS A SLIGHT DISCOUNT ON THOSE FEES. SO WE BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE OBTAINED. A FAIR FEW ARRANGEMENT FOR THE ST FROM THESE COUNCIL -- ALE. GOOD MORNING BRIAN BROWN WITH THE L. A. L. -- YEAH WE TOOK A LOOKAT THIS AND WE FELT THAT GIVEN THE NATURE OF THE BANKRUPTCY AND THAT IS NOT A CORE COMPETENCY OF THE COMMISSION'S CURRENT LEGAL STAFF WE THOUGHT -- THE NEED TO HIRE OUTSIDE COUNSEL MADE A LOT OF SAND IN TERMS OF THE THE MAGNITUDE THERE IS A GREAT DEAL OF UNCERTAINTY OF WHAT THOSE COSTS ARE GOING TO BE OVER THIS% THREE YEAR PERIOD AND IT COULD EVEN SCRATCH BEYOND THREE YEARS POTENTIALLY BUT AS THE COMMISSION NOTED. LOOKING BACK AT THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH IT TWO THOUSAND ONE BANKRUPTCY WE FELT LIKE THIS SEEM LIKE A REASONABLE. ORDER OF MAGNITUDE ASKED THE MAN AND WE ALSO NOTICED A NOTE THAT THERE IS. MUCH OF THE LANGUAGE PROPOSED BY THE ADMINISTRATION THAT LIMITS THE DOLLARS TO BE USED FOR THIS PURPOSE AND CAN'T BE USED FOR ANY OTHER PURPOSE OF THAT. THEN IF IT TURNS OUT THAT THERE'S LESS FUNDING REQUIRED -- IT WILL BE USED FOR ANYTHING ELSE. MEMBERS ANYBODY ELSE HAVE A QUESTION CENTER MONEY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- SO THE QUESTION THERE'S IN THE STAFF COMMENTS OF FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH FOR THE FINANCIAL ADVISER -- WHO'S THE FINANCIAL ADVISER THE FINANCIAL ADVISORS A FIRM CALLED TO SERRA PARTNERS. IN. IN THEIR RETAINED AT FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH THAT IS CORRECT HOW MANY PERSONAL DISSENT IN LAW -- THE CONTRACT PROVIDES THAT THE ASSIGNED PERSONNEL WILL BE AVAILABLE -- ON ON AN ON CALL BASIS MEANING THAT THEY ARE FULLY COMMITTED TO THIS PROJECT -- THE FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS COMPARES -- TO ANOTHER NUMBER THAT IS HIGHER FOR ANOTHER FINANCIAL ADVISER IN THIS PROCEEDING -- WE ALSO DID SOME DUE DILIGENCE. BEFORE HIRING TO SERRA AND THERE WAS ANOTHER FIRM WHO WAS IN THE RUNNING. AND THEY WERE COMING IN AT I CAN SAY THIS FULLY RELIABLY BECAUSE I'M GOING BY MY MEMORY. I BELIEVE -- SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND COMING DOWN. TO FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND AND I BELIEVE THIS IS A STANDARD ARRANGEMENT IN A BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDING FOR THE COUNCIL. TO HAVE A FINANCIAL ADVISER. WHO CAN WORK WITH THEM THEY'RE WORKING UNDER THE UMBRELLA OF OUR ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE SO THAT OUR COUNCIL CAN GIVE US ADVICE? ABOUT WHAT IS. HEY WHAT IS OCCURRING IN THE FINANCIAL MARKETS WHICH WE NEED TO KNOW. AND BE WHAT THE ANALYTICS ARE. ON NOT ONLY P. GENIE THAT ON ANY. TOTAL DEALS THAT ARE BEING DEVELOPED. THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THE COMMENT -- LUCRATIVE BUSINESS TO BE IN IT SOUNDS LIKE -- THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THERMAL WIRE THANK YOU SO MUCH THIS YEAR. LOOK I UNDERSTAND A SEPARATION BETWEEN THE MINISTRATION PC. AND ESPECIALLY IN CHALLENGING TIMES THAT THIS I NEED TO ENSURE THAT BE IT THE STATE IS ABLE TO WORK. IN A UNITED FRONT AND SOME ITEMS. I'M CURIOUS ABOUT HOW YOUR COUNCILS WORKING WITH THE ADMINISTRATION'S COUNCIL TO ENSURE THAT. WE ARE UNIFIED AND WHAT'S GOING TO BE BEST FOR THE RATE PAYER AND WILL THERE BE -- GROUP DISCUSSIONS MEETINGS BETWEEN THE TWO CAN YOU JUST FILL US IN ON THAT BECAUSE I I THINK ON SOME OF THIS IT'S GOING TO BE IMPORTANT THAT WE ARE. ALL SPEAKING WITH ONE VOICE. I AGREE WITH YOU I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE'RE ALL SPEAKING WITH ONE VOICE -- I CAN'T SPEAK FOR THE ADMINISTRATION AS A WHOLE OR THE GOVERNOR BUT MY MY TAKE IS THAT THE GOVERNOR IS HANDLING STATEWIDE ISSUES. THAT ARE BROADER AND MORE COMPLEX THAN THE ISSUES OF THE PC IS HANDLING THE PC IS A PIECE OF THE PUZZLE. AND SO OUR COUNCIL WILL BE HANDLING. OUR ASPECT OF THIS AND WILL NEED TO COORDINATE WITH THE STATE AS A WHOLE WHICH I THINK IS GRAPPLING WITH A A BIGGER PROBLEM. PUSHING BACK ON THAT A BIT. THE SETTLEMENT IMPACTS THE ENTIRE STATE. SO THE GOVERNOR AND I CAN'T SPEAK FOR HIM AND I LOVE TO HEAR FROM DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AS WELL -- PC IS IT IN THE MIDDLE -- AND SO WOULD LIKE TO BE A TO GET A BETTER UNDERSTANDING IS THERE GOING TO BE COORDINATION BECAUSE THE DECISION CERTAINLY MADE YOU SEE IS GOING TO BE A STATEWIDE SIGNIFICANCE. I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU ARE IN THE WEEDS ON ALL ISSUES IN OUR TECHNICAL MATTERS OF THE BANKRUPTCY. AND BEING ABLE TO HAVE A COORDINATED EFFORT IS GOING TO BE CRITICAL. NO MATTER WHAT ORGANIZATION HERE IN NO MATTER HOW LARGE THE ORGANIZATION IS. SO IS THERE ARE THERE PLANS -- TO INSURE ESPECIALLY ON MATTERS. WHERE? ADMINISTRATION POTENTIAL LEGISLATURE WILL BE IS IN COORDINATION -- IN ON THE SAME FRONT. I THINK THE PC WILL BE COORDINATING WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE THE PIECE IS AN INDEPENDENT AGENCY BUT WE WORK CLOSELY WITH THE ADMINISTRATION -- THE PC COMMISSIONERS ARE APPOINTED BY THE GOVERNOR SIR I UNDERSTAND THAT IS A STATE IN MY I I UNDERSTAND. SEPARATION OF CHURCH AND STATE SO I TOTALLY GET THAT AND I DON'T NEED THE LESSON JUST BEING REALLY CANDID WITH YOU RIGHT. SO I'DLIKE YOU TO GET STRAIGHT TO MY ANSWER MY QUESTION YOU KNOW LIKE A STRAIGHT ANSWER. PLEASE DON'T GIVE ME A LESSON ON WHO DOES WHAT I DON'T NEED THAT. I'M ASKING ABOUT CORONATION IN PLEASE ADDRESS YES WE WILL COORDINATE. AS GRAY INTO WHETHER PLANS APPEAR TO DO THAT -- TO BE HONEST I FEEL IT'S A QUESTION THAT'S ABOVE MY PAY GRADE. OKAY SO THROUGH THE CHAIR THAT IS SOMETHING THAT I'D LIKE TO BE A TO GET A BETTER UNDERSTANDING ON BECAUSE THE MINISTRATION HAS BEEN COORDINATING WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND VICE VERSA. AND SINCE YOU ARE ON THE FRONT LINES I BELIEVE IT TO BE YOU SEE SHOULD BE COORDINATING WITH THE ADMINISTRATION AS WELL -- AND WOULD LIKE TO BE A TO GET A FOLLOW UP ON THAT AND HOW THAT'S GOING TO LIE I WILL BE HAPPY LIKE THANK YOU SO MUCH CENTER [inaudible] HEY MISTER -- IT WOULD HELP IF WE CAN FLESH OUT. THE EXACT NATURE OF THE VARIOUS TYPES OF ADVICE THAT THE P. YOU SEE IS GOING TO BE GETTING FROM OUTSIDE COUNSEL HERE SO -- IN TERMS OF THE FEDERAL BANKRUPTCY CODE PROVISIONS ABOUT P. YOU SEIZE APPROVAL. OF ANY FINAL SETTLEMENT AFFECTING RATES IS THIS -- WITH THIS APPROPRIATION. DEAL WITH THAT -- WILL PROCESS OR IS THIS MORE IN THE FRONT END CAN YOU HELP US WITH SCOPE. JUST GET A SENSE OF THE VARIOUS PHASES I'M SO IN TERMS OF THE ADVISORY PROCESS IS WALK US THROUGH MAYBE -- IS SUPPOSED TO IS THIS THE SORT OF THE WHOLE THING RIGHT. IT AT THIS POINT PARTICIPATING IN A PROCEEDING BUT ALSO. ON THE APPROVAL PROCESS AND AND AND SIR EVEN ANTICIPATING THAT -- HELP WAS WAS GO. SO THE END GAME OF THE FINAL POINT OF THE BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDING IS THE P. GINNY WILL HAVE A PLAN. AND THE PLAN WILL BE APPROVED EITHER IN PART FOR SPECIFIC ELEMENTS OF IT THAT RELATE TO FINANCE BY TH COMMISSION AND IT WILL ALSO BE APPROVED BY THE BANKRUPTCY COURT. SO IN ORDER FOR THE PLAN TO BE WORKABLE. IT NEEDS TO WORK. FOR ALL OF THE PARTICIPANTS AND THE BANKRUPTCY NEEDS TO WORK FOR P. JEANNIE AND NEEDS TO WORK FOR P. GENIES CREDITORS AND EQUITY HOLDERS. BUT IT NEEDS TO WORK FOR THE COMMISSION AS THE REGULATOR AS WELL. AND IT NEEDS TO WORK FOR RATEPAYERS AND SO OUR JOB IS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PLAN. WORKS FOR EVERYONE INCLUDING US INCLUDING THE REPAIR. AT THE OUTSET. RIGHT NOW WE WILL BE STARTING TO GET INVOLVED IN DISCUSSIONS. ON HOW THE PLAN IS STRUCTURED HOW IT'S CONCEPTUALIZE WITH THE BASIC ELEMENTS OF THE PLATTER. AS IT GETS FLUSHED OUT. WE WILL NEED TO RELY ON OUR FINANCIAL ADVISER. AND ON OUR COUNCIL. TO DETERMINE HOW IT'S GOING TO WORK WITH THE REPAIR PACKS WILL BE. AND AT THE END WE WILL NEED TO DECIDE WHETHER WE AS AN AGENCY WANT TO APPROVE BY THE PLANET ELEMENTS TO PLAN THEIR WITHIN OUR JURISDICTION. WHERE'S THE BOOK OF THE WORKING TO BE IS IT. IS IT A IS IT A RIGHT NOW. THING OR IS THIS THAT'S A REALLY GOOD QUESTION OKAY -- I'VE BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS ARE LUMPY WORK HAPPENS IN REALLY BIG CHUNKS. AT TIMES THAT ARE UNPREDICTABLE. I MEAN IF THERE'S A QUICK EXIT THEN THE BULK OF THE WORK I GOING TO START TOMORROW IF THERE'S A SLOW EXIT. I THINK THE BULK OF THE WORK WILL START ABOUT A YEAR FROM NOW -- SO IT'S IT'S VERY UNPREDICTABLE THAT'S PROBABLY ARE ASKING FOR THE MONEY FOR THREE YEARS. SO THAT IT'S THERE WHEN IT'S NEEDED -- AND AT THIS POINT IT'S RELATIVELY EARLY DAYS IN THE BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDING SO WE CAN'T PREDICT HOW IT'S GONNA GO. REMIND ME AGAIN WHO WHO IS THE OUTSIDE LEGAL COUNSEL IT'S A LITTLE CANCELS THE PAUL WEISS FIRM THIS IS PAUL WEISS AND THOSE DO SERRA SERRA PARTNERS AND THIS YEAR'S RELATIVELY NEW RIGHT I MEAN THEY STARTED IN TWENTY SIXTEEN TO MY KNOWLEDGE -- IS THAT I AM SPEAKING FROM WHAT I HAVE READ ON THE WEBSITE AND AND I BELIEVE SOMETHING I READ THE WALLSTREET JOURNAL. THE THE MAIN DRIVER THE MAIN PRINCIPLES AND IS OUR PARTNERS WERE WITH THE COOL HAND LOKI FIRM. I FELT AS IF HE W. P. OKAY I MIGHT BE RE I'VE READ ABOUT THE IS D. U. C. E. R. A. THAT'S CORRECT. I THOUGHT THEY HAD LEFT A BIG A BOUTIQUE INVESTMENT FIRM WHICH ONE DID YOU SAY YOU WILL HAND LUCKY OKAY. I'M ALL RIGHT. OVEN AND THEN. THE POP IN YOUR POLL WISE COUNSEL IS BASED OUT OF SERVICE IS GOING TO YOUR OUT OF NEW YORK OKAY. AT BUT SO THE WOULD YOU SAY RIGHT NOW IS A MORE FINANCIAL. PHASE AND AND THAT LATER IS GOING TO BE MORE LEGAL IS THAT NOT THE RIGHT WAY TO THINK ABOUT IT ONE THING WE'VE BEEN STRUGGLING WITH IS THE LACK OF OF MATH FRANKLY THAT WE'RE GETTING IN TERMS OF THE ABILITY TO CHECK WHAT THE MARKETS ARE TELLING US. WE GET THERE'S A LOT OF ADVOCACY GOING ON A LOT OF THINGS -- CAST ABOUT YOU KNOW YOU HEAR NUMBERS COMING OUT OF ELLIOTT MANAGEMENT. THE GENIE WILL THEN COME UP WITH pTHINGS COMING FROM OTHER EQUITY AND DEBT HOLDERS. DO YOU ANTICIPATE ON THE FINANCIAL SIDE -- ANY SORT OF MORE PUBLIC FACING OR AT LEAST LEGISLATIVELY FACING INTERFACE FOR WE CAN GET A SENSE OF HOW. TO RIGHT SIZE RELEASED ANALYZE SOME OF THE INFORMATION E'RE GETTING BACK OR IS THAT SORT OF BEYOND THE SCOPE OF WHAT YOU'RE ANTICIPATING USING THE SERVICES I MEAN TO THE EXTENT THAT THE P. UC STAFF UNDERSTAND THE SITUATION OF FINANCIAL MARKETS I THINK WOULD BE HAPPY. TO PROVIDE YOU KNOW BRIEF LEGISLATORS -- WE ARE GOING I MEAN PART OF THE PURPOSE OF HAVING A FINANCIAL ANALYST ON BOARD IS TO MONITOR WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE FINANCIAL COMMUNITY. SO WE CAN UNDERSTAND WHAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING WHETHER PROPOSALS MAKES SENSE WHETHER THEY DON'T. WHAT WHAT THEIR EFFECT ON REPAIRS MIGHT BE? AND I DO HAVE LIMITATIONS ON YOUR ABILITY TO TO INTERFACE WITH US ON THAT. I MEAN IS THERE IS THERE SOME PRIVILEGE THAT YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO SAY CERTAIN THINGS TO US AND ALLOWED TO SHARE OTHERS OR I HAVEN'T REALLY THOUGHT THAT THROUGH I MEAN MAY KNOW WE HAVE PRETTY -- LIBERAL -- AS RULES IN TERMS OF THE INTERFACE WITH THE LEGISLATURE IN WHICH YOU'RE JUST HEARING TODAY IS. LET'S LET'S MAXIMIZE THAT COME THE THE FLOW THAT CONVERSATION TO AT LEAST ARM US WITH THE BEST INFORMATION POSSIBLE BECAUSE YES I I MEAN I UNDERSTAND. THAT I I'M I'M A LAWYER SO I'M ALWAYS CONCERNED ABOUT ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIDE. YOU KNOW IT'S LIKE HOW DOES THAT LINE UP I KNOW THE EX PARTE APPLIES VERY DIFFERENTLY TO CONVERSATIONS THE LEGISLATURE WHERE YOU DON'T HAVE THE SAME RESTRICTIONS BUT HOW THAT LINES UP WITH YOUR ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE VERSUS YOUR PRIVILEGE WITH THEIR FINANCIAL SERVICE VISOR. JUST LOVE SOME FEEDBACK ON THAT FIND OUT THE SCOPE AND THEN LET'S SORT OF MAXIMIZE THE FLOW THAT THE BEST YEAH LET ME THINK ABOUT OKAY. THANK YOU. I THINK IT'S SAD. PART OF THE WORK OUT IS GOING TO BE OUTSIDE THE BANKRUPTCY COURT THAT'S GOING TO BE WHAT THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR COME TOGETHER WE'VE TALKED ABOUT. YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S NOT A SECRET THAT THERE'S FUNDING IS GOING TO BE AN IMPORTANT THING AND HOW THAT HOW THAT PIECE GOES IN. I BELIEVE THE DEBTOR IN POSSESSION WILL USE THAT AS THE P. YOU SEE WILL USE THAT SO SO THERE'S MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THIS IS THE THIS IS THE BANKRUPTCY WORK. THAT WE'RE PAYING FOR THE OTHER NORMAL LEGISLATIVE WORKER OR DATED THEY WORK THE PC DOES NOT THAT THESE FOLKS WON'T TOUCH IT BUT IT'S GOOD TO BE WITH THE BANKRUPTCY LANDS ON IT AND THAT WOULD BE. BASED ON WHILE IT'S A COLLABORATIVE ENVIRONMENT IT'S THE DEBTOR POSSESSIONS PLAN YOU KNOW SO WE BUT SOMETIMES WE AS LEGISLATORS WANT TO SAY WELL THIS IS MY PLANNER ON THE GOVERNOR THIS IS MY PLAN. THAT'S ALL NICE FOR THE PRESS BUT THIS IS THE DEBTOR IN POSSESSION IS PLANNED AND IT'S COLLABORAIVE AND ACT BUT I KNOW THIS IS ROUND TWO WITH THE JUDGE. SO WE I THINK WE HAVE WORKED OUT WHAT THE ROLE OF THE P. YOU SEE IS WHAT THE ROLE OF IT IS BECAUSE THE WHOLE UNITED STATES IS LEARNED FROM. BANKRUPTCY. P. JEANNIE ROUND ONE SO I JUST WANNA IT'S WORD OF CAUTION THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO RE LITIGATE WHAT ARE. RESPONSIBILITIES ARE LET'S GET IN AND AND AND FIGURE OUT HOW THOSE DIFFERENT PIECES ARE BECAUSE FOR MY COLLEAGUES THE PLAN COMES TOGETHER IS DIFFERENT PIECES YOU WORK OUT. DIFFERENT AGREEMENTS WITH DIFFERENT CREDITORS AND HOW YOU'RE GOING TO WORK OUT AND THEN IT COMES TOGETHER AND MOSAICS SO [inaudible] THAT'S THAT'S ALL I HAVE TO SAY. WE'RE GONNA HOLD THIS MATTER. OPEN -- WILL BE BACK LATER ON LOOKING FOR THE MAY REVISE ALL RIGHT. ANYTHING YOU WANT TO ADD AT THE END. OF NOT IF THEY'RE NOT ANYMORE QUESTIONS OKAY LET'S BOOK.

WITH THE FTC PLEASE PROCEED YES OF BERNARD AS A VETO LEFT DIRECTOR FOR ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES -- HE ADMINISTRATION HAS DIRECTED THE PC TO INCREASE THE COMMISSION'S PRESENCE OUTSIDE OF SAN FRANCISCO TO BETTER COLLABORATIVE COLLABORATE WITH OTHER STATE AGENCIES. PROVIDE MORE TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES FOR STAFF AND PROMOTE PUBLIC ACCESSIBILITY TO THE AGENCY. ADDITIONALLY CHAPTER THREE FOUR ONE STATUTE OF TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN IN S. B. EIGHT FORTY DIRECTS THE CPUC TO DEVELOP OPTIONS FOR LEVERAGING ADDITIONAL FACILITIES. IN AREAS OF THE STATE INCLUDING SACRAMENTO. THAT WOULD ALLOW THE COMMISSION TO COLLABORATE WITH OTHER STATE ENTITIES AND PROVIDE STAFF MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR TRAINING CAREER DEVELOPMENT. AND EXCHANGE AND PLACEMENTS AND OTHER STATE ENTITIES. THE C. P. U. C. SIX A PRESENCE THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA WITH LOCATIONS IN SAC SAN FRANCISCO SACRAMENTO LOS ANGELES AND SAN DIEGO. CPUC ALREADY HAS OFFICES IN SAN FRANCISCO SACRAMENTO AND LOS ANGELES. A SAN DIEGO OFFICE IS UNDER CONSIDERATION IN A FUTURE PHASE OF DECENTRALIZATION. THE LONG TERM PLAN INCLUDES AN INCREASED PRESENCE TO BETTER SERVE OUR REGULATED COMMUNITY WHICH INCLUDES THE ABOVE MENTIONED LOCATIONS. THE GOAL OF DECENTRALIZATION IS TO PROVIDE GREATER ACCESS THROUGH THE TO THE PC. THROUGH ESTABLISHING OFFICES THROUGHOUT THE STATE. INCREASING THE PC'S FOCUS AND EXPERTISE BY RELOCATING RESPONSIBILITIES AND MAKING LOGISTICAL CHANGES THAT IMPROVE THE COMMISSION'S ABILITY TO FUNCTION. TO ESTABLISH CROSS AGENCY RELATIONSHIPS FOR EXAMPLES. WITH THE CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD DIVISION OF OIL GAS AND GEOTHERMAL RESOURCES. TO FOSTER COLLABORATION AND COORDINATION IN ACTIONS AND EXCHANGES OF INFORMATION. GREAT I'M SO UPDATE THE GUY A SUBCOMMITTEE NOW WE HAVE DSG. THE GST GST GS -- AND YOU KNOW IT'S A IT'S A MONSTER FOR US TO TRY TO UNDERSTAND WE KNOW WE-HAVE ACCESS TO THE PROPERTY WE WE KNOW FROM THIS COMMITTEE THAT THE AIR RESOURCE BOARD IS MOVING OUT OF LA. AND MOVING OVER TO RIVERSIDE TO COAL CO LOCATE WITH WITH THEM. X. HI UPDATE US ON WHAT YOU THE WORK THAT YOU'VE DONE WITH A D. S. G. ON THIS SURPLUS STATE PROPERTY THAT YOU MAY. BE ABLE TO MOVE INTO BECAUSE WE SEE THAT YOU'RE MOVING INTO OUR STREET. ON A LEASE. AND I'M WONDERING IS THAT A STATE PROPERTY EITHER I COME IN ON CUE SO I KNOW IT'S OVER THERE I FEEL. COMFORTABLE BUT IT IS AT THE CORE AND THE POINT OF THE QUESTION IS IS THAT WE HAVE TO STAY PROPERTY THAT'S THERE THIS IS. NORMAL OFFICE BUT WHEN YOU GET FIFTEEN TWENTY PEOPLE IN LA YOU COULD BE ANYWHERE RIGHT WOULD PUT PVC UP IN AFTER SOME STATE PROPERTY THAT SURPLUS. ARE WE EXHAUSTING THOSE AREAS AND YOU KNOW -- RE PURPOSING I'M WE HAVE. CAL FIRE WE HAVE DMV THEY COME IN HERE THAT SAY WITHOUT GROWN OUR FACILITY AND WE WANT TO MOVE TO SOMETHING ELSE SO IS A P. YOU SEE. TRY TO GOBBLE UP THOSE PROPERTIES. YES SENATOR -- WE ARE ACTIVELY ENGAGED WITH DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL SERVICES ON ALL THE SURPLUS PROPERTIES THEY HAVE AVAILABLE THROUGHOUT THE STATE WITH THESE TIPS. SPECIFIC LOVE LOCATIONS IN SAN FRANCISCO WE'VE WORKED CLOSELY WITH. GENERAL SERVICES AT THE FOUR FIFTY FIVE GOLDEN GATE AVENUE BUILDING WHERE WE HAVE A PORTION OF THE ENERGY THE DIVISION -- IN SACRAMENTO THERE WASN'T MUCH LESS SPACE AVAILABLE AND WE PUT OUT AN ADVERTISEMENT AND IT WAS COMPETITIVELY BID AND THAT WAS THE BEST DEAL WE COULD ACHIEVE WAS THE OUR STREET -- PROPERTY IN LOS ANGELES -- THERE IS LIMITED AVAILABILITY IN OUR CURRENT BUILDING AND THE BUT WE ARE LOOKING -- TO BECOME MORE DECENTRALIZED SO WE DID VISIT THE US STATE BUILDING IN SAN DIEGO AND IT'S A BUILDING THAT WE ARE INTERESTED IN. AND WE WOULD SEEK A VERY ECONOMICAL AND APPROPRIATE ENGAGEMENT WITH DEPARTMENT GENERAL SERVICES L. L. ANYTHING. WE DON'T HAVE ANY CONCERNS WITH THE PARTICULAR PROPOSAL WE WE DO NOTE AS IS LISTED IN YOUR AGENDA THAT. WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF INFORMATION RIGHT NOW ON WHAT PHASE TWO IS GOING TO LOOK LIKE THAT SEEM TO BE STILL UNDER DEVELOPMENT BY THE COMMISSION. WE DO THINK THIS COMMITTEE HEARING IN PROBABLY FUTURE ONE WILL BE GOOD OPPORTUNITIES FOR YOU TO IDENTIFY AND ASK THE COMMISSION FOR WHAT. THEIR FUTURE PLANS ARE FOR DECENTRALIZATION -- THE LOCATION OF THE COMMISSION. AND IN HOW MUCH OF ITS OPERATIONS ARE CENTERED IN SAN FRANCISCO THAN AN AREA OF INTERESTFOR SOME LEGISLATORS IN THE PAST -- IN RENT. THAT'S RIGHT AND SO -- A AND WE KNOW AS WELL THAT THERE IS THE COMMISSIONER THERE COULD BE OPPORTUNITIES PANEL WHICH UNITS IT MOVES TO WHICH LOCATION THERE MAY BE OPPORTUNITIES TO IMPROVE. OPERATIONS COORDINATION WITH AND WITH THE AIR BOARD WITH THE ENERGY COMMISSION WITH OTHER AGENCIES AND SO IT MAY BE VALUABLE. TO DO YOUR DUE DILIGENCE YOUR OVERSIGHT OVER THE COMMISSION MAKE SURE THEY'RE USING THE RIGHT CRITERIA IN DETERMINING THAT THE CENTER LINE AND SEND A SNEAK PREVIEW SOME FACE TO YOU CAN HELP US OUT HERE. NOT AT THIS TIME. CENTER JONES. A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS REGARDING THE SANDY LOCATION -- IS THAT A A SERIOUS -- IS THAT A HOME IS A SERIOUS ACCIDENT IS THAT SOMETHING THAT YOU MIGHT ACTUALLY PURSUE IS -- MOVING SOME OF THE OPERATIONS TO SAN DIEGO. YES SENATOR I PERSONALLY VISITED THE FRONT STREET -- BUILDING LAST WEEK I WALKED THE ENTIRE BUILDING SAW MULTIPLE SPACES THERE I SUBMITTED A THE WORK PLAN OF THE FLOOR PLAN. AND OTHER DOCUMENTATION TO THE DIRECTOR OF THE CPC THIS LAST WEEK -- IT'S IT IS A SERIOUS CONSIDERATION. THIS IS WHAT WILL THAT OFFICE HAVE -- HE CAN YOU TELL ME THE LEVEL OF INTERACTION IT WOULD HAVE WITH THE PUBLIC COMING TO THAT BUILDING OR IS IT MOSTLY -- STATE EMPLOYEES THAT DON'T INTERACT WITH THE PUBLIC. I WOULD CONSIDER IT A KIND OF LIKE A SATELLITE OFFICE BECAUSE IT DOESN'T HAVE OF THE FULL CAPABILITIES FOR HEARING ROOMS AT THIS POINT. THERE IS A A MAJOR HEARING ROOM IN THE BASEMENT THAT I TOURED BUT UNFORTUNATELY BECAUSE OF THE LIMITED ABILITY TO UPGRADE THAT BUILDING -- IT'S VERY DOUBTFUL WOULD BE ABLE TO USE THOSE FACILITIES BUT I DID. CERTAINLY TOUR THAT AREA AND CONSIDER IT MOST OF THE STAFF -- LOCATING THERE WOULD BE WORKING OUTSIDE OF THE OFFICE -- THEY WOULD BE DOING THE INSPECTIONS INVESTIGATIONS -- ALE JAY'S WOULD BE THERE AND MOST LIKELY OUR HEARINGS WE HAVE TO BE IN LOS ANGELES OR SOME OTHER LEASED SPACE I CAN I WANNA MAKE SHORT TIME AT THE BILLING ON FRONT STREET. ON FRONT STREET THAT IS CLOSE TO MY MY CONCERN WITH THAT BUILDING IS -- IF THE PUBLIC HAS. TO HAVE ACCESS TO THE EMPLOYEES ARE THE PARKING IS -- NOT VERY GOOD THERE FOR THE PUBLIC AND I THINK THERE'S EVEN SOME PARKING CHALLENGES FOR THE EMPLOYEES IT'S IT'S IT'S KIND OF UNDER PART -- I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE REACHED OUT TO THE LEGISLATORS THAT ARE LOCATED. IN THAT OFFICE BUILDING KIND OF GET THEIR TAKE ON THE INTERACTION WITH THE PUBLIC -- FOR THAT I HAVE IS IF THERE'S NO PUBLIC INTERACTION AND I'M LESS CONCERNED IF THERE'S SIGNIFICANT PUBLIC INTERACTION AND I'M. THE CONCERNS HIGHER. I WOULD CONSIDER IT -- MINIMAL OKAY. THE JUDGE WHEN YOU'RE IN THERE. WHEN YOU GET A PC IN SAN DIEGO YEAH. ART LET'S OPEN UP THE PUBLIC HEARING THESE ARE THE ISSUES THAT WERE HOLDING OPEN WITH THE P. YOU SEE IT'S ISSUE. EIGHT TEN ELEVEN AND TWELVE ANYBODY PUBLIC WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS WHAT WE HAVE MEMBERS OF P. YOU SEE HERE. WE'LL CLOSE THE PUBLIC HEARING THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOU SEE -- MEMBERS LET'S JUMP [inaudible] TO ISSUE NUMBER SEVEN WITH THE M -- THE ENERGY COMMISSION IS ENERGY HERE NOW. THIS IS THE ENERGY RESOURCE PROGRAM ACCOUNT DEFICIT REDUCTION WE HAVE HIT. THE POINT ZERO ZERO ZERO THREE LIMIT. A KILOWATT HOURS WE HAVE INDEED YES PLEASE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH DREW BONE I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR THE ENERGY COMMISSION -- THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE TIME TO HEAR FROM US THAT ACCOUNT THE ENERGY RESOURCES PROGRAMS ACCOUNT THE ACCOUNT. A GENERATES FOR US -- WHAT HAS BEEN HISTORICALLY SUFFICIENT FUNDS TO RUN A? LARGE CHUNK OF OUR ORGANIZATION HOWEVER IT IS IN A STRUCTURAL DEFICIT AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE BEFORE YOU -- THIS MORNING. DEMAND FOR OUR SERVICES HAS BEEN INCREASING WE'VE GOT ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED PLUS STAFF OF THE ENERGY COMMISSION. OF FOUR HUNDRED PLUS OF THOSE ARE FUNDED FROM THIS ACCOUNT OVER THE LAST ABOUT DECADE YOU -- GRANTED A SEVENTY NEW POSITION SO IT'S GROWN CONSIDERABLY AT THE SAME TIME THE REVENUES HAVE BEEN DECLINING. IN IT THERE'S TWO REASONS FOR THIS THE FIRST IS THE BUYING THE METER SOLAR THAT WE'VE BEEN SO SUCCESSFUL WITH THE CALIFORNIA WE'RE UP TO ABOUT EIGHT EIGHT GIGAWATTS RIGHT NOW AND TO PUT THAT IN PERSPECTIVE THAT'S MORE. THAT PRODUCES MORE ENERGY THAN THE STATE OF VERMONT CONSUMES IN ITS ENTIRETY SO WE'VE REALLY DONE WELL. WHAT WOULD THAT BE IN DOLLARS SO THAT WE HAVE A? YOU KNOW IF WE IF WE WERE ABLE TO CHARGE FOR THE BEHIND THE METER AND WHICH I NOW I REALIZE THAT'S LEGISLATION SOME PEOPLE. RIGHTI'LL GET EMAILS FROM IT BUT BUT IT'S IT IS [inaudible] A CONCERN. AMONG THE ITEMS THAT YOUR STAFF AND THE AWAY ALWAYS IDENTIFIED AS POTENTIAL AREAS TO INCREASE REVENUES. TO TO CLOSER SHORTFALL IS TO IMPOSE THIS CHARGE WHICH ISN'T CURRENTLY. IMPOSED ON BY THE METER TO BUY THE METER AND TEST YOUR QUESTION THE THE THE NUMBER -- IT I GUESS YOUR QUESTION WOULD BE WHAT IF WE TOOK THE CURRENT CHARGE AND JUST STRAIGHT UP APPLIED THAT TO BEHIND ME -- I'D I THINK IT GENERATES. ABOUT DOING -- THREE MILLION. SO THAT WOULD IF WE JUST TOOK THE POINT ZERO ZERO THREE CHARGE IT WOULD GENERATE THREE MILLION MORE SO WE WOULD CLOSE THE STRUCTURAL DEFICIT WOULD FIX IT RIGHT. IT WOULD SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCE IT -- SO THANKS FOR THE QUESTION THE OTHER PIECE OF IT IS CONSERVATION. AND THAT'S CHIEFLY BAN -- ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND SO AS WE REDUCE THE ENERGY WE CONSUME BY BECOMING MORE ENERGY EFFICIENT -- AND BUILDINGS INCREASINGLY ARE BECOMING SO AS OUR APPLIANCES THAT -- THAT ALSO HAS HAS A A SUPPRESSING IMPACTS OF THIS IS GREAT FOR CALIFORNIA IT'S GREAT FOR RATEPAYERS REDUCES RATES IT'S BUT SOME THESE ARE AMONG THE REASONS WHY OUR PER CAPITA CONSUMPTION IN CALIFORNIA'S 44% LOWER. THAN THE AVERAGE THROUGHOUT THE NATION SO WE'VE DONE REALLY WELL THERE BUT IT IMPACTS OUR ABILITY TO RUN OUR OUR ORGANIZATION SO THAT'S WHY WERE -- BEFORE YOU TODAY. OF FOR THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS WE'VE BEEN SPENDING MORE THAN WE'VE -- BEEN BRINGING IN AND WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO DO THAT BECAUSE THERE'S BEEN A RESERVE THAT IS TRENDING SIGNIFICANTLY DOWNWARDS AND WILL HIT ZERO IN THE NEXT COUPLE YEARS -- I THINK I'LL MAKE SOME CHANGES SO. WHAT WE'VE GOT BEFORE YOU WILL BEFORE SAID THAT I WANT TO SAY THAT IN THE LAST TWO BUDGET CYCLES WE HAVE REDUCED THE PRESSURE ON THIS ACCOUNT? BUT TWENTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS SO WE'VE DONE A LOT OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS I THANK YOUR STAFF MR HACKER AND OTHERS WHO HAVE BEEN COLLABORATING WITH US. AND OF COURSE FINANCE TO FIGURE OUT WAYS TO DO THAT AND WE'VE WE'VE DONE IT QUITE SUBSTANTIALLY WE STILL AREN'T THERE. BUT WHAT WE'VE GOT BEFORE YOU THIS MORNING IS AN ADDITIONAL ABOUT TEN MILLION PER YEAR. THAT WOULD FURTHER REDUCE THE PRESSURE ON THIS ACCOUNT -- NOT GET US ALL THE WAY THERE BUT IT WOULD BE A HUGE HELP BELIAU -- YES WE RECOMMEND ADOPTING THE PROPOSED CHANGES IN THE APRIL FINANCE LETTER WE THINK THIS DOES MAKE A SUBSTANTIAL PROGRESS TOWARDS CLOSING THAT GAP. AS THE COMMISSION NOTED -- THEY'RE STILL A GAP REMAINING AND SO WHAT WE'VE SUGGESTED AS YOU STARTED YOUR CONVERSATION ALREADY IS WHAT ARE THOSE OTHER OPTIONS THAT MIGHT STILL BE AVAILABLE -- TO FULLY CLOSE THE GAP. THE THESE OPTIONS AS WELL THAT WE KNOW IN THE AGENDA AS WELL AS OTHERS ARE IDENTIFIED IN THE COMMISSION REPORT THAT CAME OUT EARLIER THIS YEAR -- ULTIMATELY WHETHER YOU -- YOU DO HAVE SOME TIME YOU DON'T HAVE TO DOT MORE THAN WAS PROPOSED TODAY THE THE STRUCTURAL DEFICIT REMAIN BUT IT. DOESN'T GO INTO THE RESERVES ARE DEPLETED RESERVES UNTIL TWENTY AT TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE SO YOU HAVE SOME TIME. BUT IF YOU CHOOSE NOT TO FULLY CLOSED THE GAP NOW WE WOULD RECOMMEND GUESS IF YOU HAVE THE LAST TWO YEARS THE DOCKING SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT LANGUAGE. REQUIRING THE COMMISSION TO COME BACK TO YOU AGAIN NEXT YEAR WITH ADDITIONAL OPTIONS. WHAT'S YOUR OPINION I I KNOW THAT SOME LEGISLATORS WHENEVER WE HAVE A TWO THIRDS VOTE KIT LITTLE SQUEAMISH ABOUT ABOUT THAT BUT AS AS FAR AS GRANTING THE AUTHORITY YOU KNOW WERE -- WE'RE ALL WE ALL HAD MATH SO WE'VE GOT POINT. ZERO ZERO THREE THREE TEN THOUSANDTHS. THE VIRUS AT THREE TEN THOUSANDS PER KILOWATT HOUR -- IF THE AUTHORITY WERE BUT LET'S SEE RIGHT MEASUREMENT AND BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT WE DON'T WANT LEGISLATORS TO BE WORKING YOU KNOW IF WE'RE GOING TO RAISE THE CAP. WE DON'T WANT LEGISLATORS TO COME BACK -- OR HAVE TO VOTE ON THIS ON AN ANNUAL BIG ANNUAL BASIS BECAUSE PER IS AN IMPORTANT PROGRAM BUT THE BUT WE REALIZE THAT THEY HAVE TO COME TO US IF WE RAISE THE CAP. I'M JUST MAKING UP NUMBERS. FOR TEN THOUSANDS YOU KNOW JUST TO PICK BECAUSE I GUESS WE GO THREE POINT THREE FIVE TWO TWO TWO OR WHATEVER THE NUMBER IS IF WE DID. pCLOSE THAT STRUCTURAL DEFICIT BY JUST USING A TINY PORTION OF THAT -- AS A AS AN INCREASE IN THEN YOU WOULD HAVE THAT RESERVE AS THE ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND THE THESE OTHER MATTERS GO ON OR MAYBE NEVER USE IT. DO YOU HAVE A OPINION. HE READ THE REPORT YES. NO A A CERTAINLY THE LEGISLATURE HAS DISCRETIONTO RAISE THAT CAPPED WHATEVER IT DECIDES THE AND IS IT IS -- PROGRAMS WORK IN THE PAST THE THERE'S BEEN THE STATUTORY CAP AND PRIOR TO THAT THERE WAS DISCUSSION ABOUT -- THEY DIDN'T FULLY -- A UTILIZED IN THE ENTIRE SPACE THAT WAS AVAILABLE THE YOU COULD FOR EXAMPLE INCREASE THE CAP TO SOME HIGHER LEVEL KNOWING THAT THAT DOESN'T NECESSARILY MAN THAT YOU -- THE COMMISSION WOULD CHARGE THAT FULL AMOUNT AND INSTEAD IT WOULD BE DICTATED BY. WHATEVER BUDGET PROPOSALS ARE APPROVED BY YOU TO PROVIDE PROGRAMS AND PROVIDE SERVICES USING THE HERB OF FINE AND SO YOU COULD IMAGINE A SCENARIO WHERE YOU HAVE SOME FLEXIBILITY. WITH A HIGHER CAP BUT YOU WOULD STILL HAVEA LOT OF WITH AUTHORITY TO DETERMINE WELL WHAT WE ONE OF WHAT BUDGET PRIORITIES THAT WE HAVE IN IN JUST MAKING SURE THAT THE ACTUAL AMOUNT COLLECTED IS. COMMENSURATE WITH THAT RIGHT NOW AND WE WOULD HAVE I MEAN IF WE DID BEHIND THE METER AND AND AND HAD THAT INCLUDED IN THE STRUCTURAL DEFICIT WOULD BE LESS SO THAT. THAT. FUDGE FACTOR WOULD BE A LITTLE BIT THAT WOULD KEEP US YOU KNOW EVERY YEAR WE HAVE A REPORT OR FUTURE. HERE'S A STEP TWO WOULD HAVE A REPORT THAT SAID OKAY WE HAVE TO ADJUST TO RATE THIS MUCH IN ORDER TO GET IT WE HAVE THE AUTHORITY WERE ASKING. YOU KNOW IN A PUBLIC HEARING TO HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO GO DO IT AND THAT'S A DIFFERENT THAT'S A DIFFERENT CONVERSATION. THEN THE STRUCTURAL DEFICIT EVERY TIME I'M UP HERE. THE SERVER MAY THE JUST TO PUT THIS ABSTRACTION OF THREE TEN THOUSANDS INTO PERSPECTIVE WHAT IT IMPACTS -- THE REST AVERAGE RESIDENTIAL METER IT'S ABOUT SEVENTEEN CENTS PER MONTH. AND THE INCREASE YOU JUST DESCRIBE IT AT ABOUT ANOTHER NICKEL PER MONTH -- TO THAT. EVER TO REPAIR OKAY THIS IS THE ONLY MATTER WE HAVE WITH THE ENERGY COMMISSION GOOD OPEN UP THE PUBLIC HEARING. ANY -- FRACTION INTO CS THAT WANT TO TALK TO US ADDRESS THE CLOSE THE PUBLIC HEARING THERE'S NO ACTION BE TAKEN WE'RE GOING. TO ALL THIS MATTER OPEN THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THE MEMBERS RIGHT.
