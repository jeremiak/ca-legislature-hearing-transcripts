ONCE AGAIN THANK YOU- I AM HERE TO PRESENT SENATE BILL NINE OH FIVE THE BACKGROUND CHECKS SECURITY AT. CALIFORNIA LAW ALLOWS ORGANIZATIONS TO REQUEST ALL OF AN APPLICANT'S RECORDSOF CONVICTIONS FROM CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE IF THE APPLICANT WOULD HAVE SUPERVISOR OR DID DISPLAY EVERY POWER. OVER MINOR OR ANOTHER IN THEIR CARE. THIS MEASURE IS PRUDENT STEP IN ENSURING THE SAFETY OF MINERS AND OTHER VULNERABLE INTO INDIVIDUALS. HOWEVER THESE REQUESTS CAN BE EXPLOITED TO DIVULGE THE LOCATION OF UNDOCUMENTED INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE APPLYING TO VOLUNTEER IN THEIR COMMUNITIES. THE BACKGROUND CHECKS CAN POTENTIALLY BE USED TO DISSEMINATE PERSONAL INFORMATION WITHOUT PROPER WARRANT CONSTITUTING AN UNLAWFUL SEIZURE. THE FEAR OF THIS PERSONAL INFORMATION BEING TAKEN HAS CREATED A CHILLING EFFECT ON THE VOLUNTEER EFFORTS OF ORGANIZATIONS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. SOME INDIVIDUALS ARE AFRAID OF VOLUNTEERING AND CONTRIBUTING AND THEIR COMMUNITIES OF FEAR OF THEIR PRIVACY BEING PREACHED BY FEDERAL ENTITIES. DURING THIS CALL BUT NINETEEN CRISIS WE NEED VOLUNTEERS MORE THAN EVER. ESPECIALLY NOW PEOPLE SHOULD BE NOT BE HELD BACK FROM PROCEDURES FROM CONTRIBUTING TO THEIR COMMUNITIES. SB NINE OH FIVE PROTECT THE PRIVACY OF CALIFORNIANS BY NO LONGER REQUIRING A RESIDENCE ADDRESS ON THE BACKGROUND CHECK. BY NOT REQUIRING AN ADDRESS ON THE BACKGROUND CHECKS WE CAN PROVIDE INSURANCE TO INDIVIDUALS THAT THEY CAN VOLUNTEER IN THEIR COMMUNITIES WITHOUT RISKING AND COMPROMISING THE SAFETY AND SECURITY OF THEMSELVES OR THEIR LOVED ONES. THE BILL WOULD ALSO PROHIBITTHE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE FOR PROVIDING ANY INFORMATION RELATED TO THESE BACKGROUND INQUIRY TO OTHER ENTITIES. INCLUDING GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES ABSENT OF A COURT ORDER OR A WARRANT. SB NINE OH FIVE DOES NOT OBSTRUCTED SORTIES IN THEIR DUTY TO KEEP KIDS SAFE FROM PREDATORS. IN FACTSB NINE OH FIVE WOULD INTRODUCE A UNIVERSAL TYPES I TAKE BACKDROP LANGUAGE. FBI STANDARDS SIMPLIFY THE PROCESS AND REDUCING THE NUMBER OF REQUESTS FOR FEDERAL CRIMINAL RECORDS THAT ARE DENIED BY THE FBI. SB FIVE EDGE TO THE EXISTING PRIVACY PROTECTIONS OF CITIZENS AND UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS ALIKE WITHIN THE STATE WITHOUT IMPENDING THE ABILITY OF THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE TO INVESTIGATE INTERACTING AFFORDABLE POPULATIONS.

ARE ISSUE OF I COULD USE BEING STOLEN OFF OF PEOPLE'S PORCHES IS A STATE WIDE AND- I LEARNED IT NATIONAL ISSUE AS SOME LIMóN LOW IS ALSO WORKING ON A SIMILAR BILL. IN 20001810% OF ALL RETAIL SALES IN THE COUNTRY OCCURRED ON LINE. BECAUSE OF THE COVERT NINETEEN SITUATION ONLINE SALES HAVE INCREASED EXPONENTIALLY. IN FACT BETWEEN MARCH AND APRIL OF THIS YEAR ONLINE SALES INCREASED 49% IN THE COUNTRY. BOB SHOPPING ONLINE CAN BE EASIER AND SAFER UNFORTUNATELY THIEVES WITH MEL INTENT. ARE INCREASINGLY STEALING PACKAGES ANY SENIOR THIEVES HAVE OFTEN BEEN REFERRED TO IN THE MEDIA AS PORCH PIRATES. THE DISPROPORTIONATE AMOUNT OF PORTS PIRACY OCCURS IN CALIFORNIA IN 20001930% OF ALL STOLEN PACKAGES ACROSS THE NATION WERE STOLEN IN THIS STATE. THESE PACKAGES CONTAIN A WIDE VARIETY OF ESSENTIAL ITEMS SUCH AS MEDICATIONS AND FOOD. ANY SENIORS AND DISABLED INDIVIDUALS RELY ON PACKAGE DELIVERY FOR SURVIVAL. IN ORDER PROTECT THOSE MOST VULNERABLE WE MUST TAKE EVERY STEP WE CAN TODAY TO STOP PORCH PRIVACY. IS A BIPARTISAN BILL SEC ALLEN IS THERE IS A CO AUTHOR OF THIS BILL AND AS I MENTIONED A SIMILAR LOW ALLEN IS A CO AUTHOR. AND ASSEMBLYMAN LOW WORKING ON A BIT I IN THE ASSEMBLY. THE NEW ME AT HOME.

THIS IS A WIDE RANGE OF OPTIONS WHEN REPORTS PRIVATE STILL THREE PACKAGES WITHIN A THREE YEAR PERIOD I WAS REALLY SURPRISED WHEN I INTRODUCED THIS BILL- BACK IN THE FALL HOW MUCH MEDIA. GEN WAS GIVEN TO THIS TOPIC I DID RADIO INTERVIEWS ACROSS THE STATE AND- I'M AT LEAST EIGHT OR NINE INTERVIEWS IN DIFFERENT AREAS OF CALIFORNIA AND THEN EVEN OTHER STATES THAT REACHED OUT TO US TO KIND OF FIGURE OUT. YOU KNOW THREE AND I THINK WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO KIND OF TAKE A LEADERSHIP ROLE HERE AS AS WE LIKE TO DO HERE IN CALIFORNIA IN THE SENATE IN THE CALIFORNIA STATE SENATE AND REALLY SET THE EXAMPLE FOR THE REST OF THE COUNTRY. THAT'S IT FOR MY OPENING COMMENTS I DO BELIEVE. SAN DIEGO DISTRICT ATTORNEY SUMMER STEPHAN. IS ON THE PHONE SHE'S MY MAIN WITNESS SO IF SHE CAN.

AT THE BILL IS A VERY MODEST BILL ADDED BALLOT IS ESSENTIAL AND PRESS THE WAY THAT IT DOES THAT IS IT THE SHOULD ORDINARY THAT FROM THESE PORCH BY. IT TO MEAN THAT YOU ACTUALLY TO ENTER INTO THE VILLAGE. SOMEONE HOME PRIME. THERE ARE A PART THERE IS SAYING NO MATTER HOW STE OR LARGE.

INSPECTOR THE WORK DONE BY THE COMMITTEE TO ADDRESS AND USE THE PACKAGE TO ACT. LIKE THAT RESULT FROM SOCIAL DUTIES AND INCOME INEQUALITY. BILL IS THE LONG POLICY FOR THE MOMENT. SB NINE SEVEN NINE SIX TO CREATE A NEW CRIMINALITY PUNISHABLE BY UP TO A YEAR IN JAIL FOR MERELY ENTERING AN AREA THAT IN A NEIGHBORHOOD IT'S HARD TO BALLOT OR DESPITE. THIS BILL ALSO GIVES NO GUIDANCE AS TO HOW TO BE IMPLEMENTED FRANKLY WITHOUT ACTUATING PROFILING. ESPECIALLY WHEN ARMS NEIGHBORHOOD WATCHMAN AND A LIGHT. SHOULD TAKE IT UPON THEMSELVES TO ENFORCE THE LAW. FURTHER THIS BILL LACKS CLARITY ON HOW TO DISTINGUISH THE INTENT TO STEAL A PACKAGE AT THE BEHAVIOR SO THAT. APART FROM MERELY TAKING A WALK WE'RE GOING FOR A RUN. PERHAPS ELECTION YOUR CAMPUS DURING WORK ANY OTHER ACTIVITY. THIS BILL IS RIGHT FOR PROVIDING ABUSE ESPECIALLY NOW WITH THE CALLING ON ESSENTIAL WORKERS TO GO INTO NEIGHBORHOODS ARE NOT FAMILIAR WITH. ALL SUPPLY AND CONNECTED. DESPITE THE WORK OF ADVOCATES AND THIS BODY TO ADDRESS EXPLICIT AND IMPLICIT BIAS THIS BILL INSTEAD SIGNAL THAT WE SHOULD LOOK TO EACH OTHER WITH SUSPICION. RUNNING pIN WAYS WORSE THAN BLOOMING BUYERS. SENATORS THE PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE ON BEHALF OF OUR BIGGER CENTER FOR HUMAN RIGHTS I URGE YOUR NOTE. THE NEXT KEY WITNESS MODERATOR ON THE PHONE FIRST LINE. LIKE A DOCTOR OFF YOUR LINE IS OPEN. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS MIGHT GET DOCTOR ALSO ON BEHALF OF THE ACLU OF CALIFORNIA WE APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S EFFORTS AND THE EFFORTS OF THE COMMITTEE AND COMMITTEE STAFF NARROW THE SCOPE OF THE BILL UNFORTUNATELY THIS DOES NOT REMOVE OUR OPPOSITION. FIRST WE DO NOT BELIEVE THIS. THE FERRY UNDER EXISTING LAW A PERSON CAN ALREADY BE PROSECUTED FOR ENTERING THE CARTILAGE AT HOME WITH THE INTENT TO COMMIT AND FAST. AND CONVICTED OF A VARIETY OF CRIMES INCLUDING ATTEMPTED PASSED ATTEMPTED RECEIVING STOLEN PROPERTY AND ATTEMPTED MAIL FAST AMONG OTHER OFFENSES. GIVEN THE AVAILABILITY OF EXISTING LAWS WE DO NOT BELIEVE SEPARATE CRIME AND- VERY. AND. CREATING THE PUNISH FOR THIS WILL NOT PEOPLE FROM ENGAGING IN THE PRESCRIBED CONTACT THE RESEARCH IT'S CLEAR THAT THE FACT OF PUNISHMENT RATHER THAN A LINK THERE CENTER AND IS A LOT MAY SERVE AS A DETERRENT INCREASING JAIL SENTENCE AT THIS TIME CA ONLY STARTS TO MAKE OUR CON COUNTY JAIL TO MORE DANGEROUS DURING ON CRAFT THEM TO THE PUBLIC CRY STASHED. MY COLLEAGUES SAID WE ARE. THAT SB NINE SEVEN NINE COULD BE YOU AS A TOOL TO DISCRIMINATE AGAINST HOMELESS PEOPLE PEOPLE WITH MENTAL ILLNESS AND PEOPLE OF COLOR IN PARTICULAR WE FELLER FEAR THAT THE BILL COULD BE USED AS A PRETEXT FOR ARRESTING PEOPLE AGAINST TO LAW ENFORCEMENT OR PROPERTY OWNERS ARE EXPLICITLY IMPLICITLY BY ASKING. PEOPLE WHO THEY BELIEVED TO NOT ALONG. FOR ALL OF THESE REASONS WHERE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSED TO THE BALLOT URGENT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU LET US SEE IF THERE'S ANY OTHER WITNESSES- IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL AGAIN THIS IS YOUR NAME AFFILIATION AND YUROK OPPOSITION ONLY AT THIS POINT. LET'S SEE IF THERE'S ANYONE HERE IN THIS HEARING ROOM. SEEING NINE ARE THERE IS THERE ANYONE IN THE HEARING ROOM ON THE SECOND FLOOR SEEING NINE- MODERATOR. BY YOU CAN SEE IF THERE'S ANYONE ON THE LINE WHO WOULD LIKE TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION. FOR THOSE ON THE PHONE LINES IF YOU'D LIKE TO HAVE YOUR VOICE HEARD PLEASE PRESS ONE AND THEN ZERO AT THIS TIME ONE MOMENT PLEASE. AND WE DO NOT HAVE ANYBODY CURING UP ON THE PHONE LINES AT THIS TIME PLEASE CONTINUE. THE. A PROVINCIAL. UPON THANK YOU SO BUT SEEING THAT THERE ARE NO OTHER WITNESSES. EITHER IN THE HEARING ROOM OR ON THE PHONE SO I WILL ALLOW SENATOR JACKSON TO ASK YOUR QUESTION THAT I BELIEVE CENTER MITCHELL YOU ADD A COMMENT OR QUESTION ADDITIONALLY ALRIGHT LET IT AND EIGHT CENTER MORE LIKE WELL SO WE'RE GOING. THANK YOU THANK YOU MANAGE- AND CENTER BROWN- MY EARLIER OBSERVATION THAT WHEN WE ARE SUPPOSED TO DEAL WITH EACH BUILT ON ITS OWN MERITS IRRESPECTIVE OF WHAT OTHER BILLS ARE BEING PRESENTED THAT'S NOT BEFORE US TODAY SO THAT WAS THE REASON FOR MY OBSERVATION UP. AND THEN I THINK YOU STILL HAVE YOUR KEY WITNESS THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY OF SAN DIEGO ON THE LINE SO EITHER CENTER IF YOU WOULD ANSWER THIS HER HAVE HER DO THAT. BOB WE HAVE THE PRIME PETTY THEFT THE CHARITY ON THE BOOKS WHAT DISTINGUISHES THIS. OF NEW CRIME FROM THE CRIME OF PETTY THEFT THE PENALTY IS I UNDERSTAND THAT IS SUPPOSED TO BE THE SAME THAT THE WOBBLY PROVISION HAS BEEN REMOVED SO THIS IS A MISDEMEANOR IN FACT PETTY THEFT WITH THE PRIOR. I THINK IT'S STILL A FELONY. WHY SHOULD WE BE CREATING A NEW MEASURE THAT IS. LESS ULTIMATELY- AS IF WE CAN'T TERMS OF AND FOR THE CRIME OF PETTY THEFT- AND HOW IS THIS. HOW DOES THIS FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF PROSECUTOR CREATE IT AN EASIER MECHANISM- TO- TO PROSECUTE INTO ULTIMATELY FIND A- A BIRD THE ALLEGED PERPETRATOR GUILTY OF THE CRIME- WHEN YOU HAVE THE CRIME OF PETTY THEFT. THE BOOK. AT REALLY GOOD QUESTION IF I CAN I WOULD I WOULD LOVE. A STEP TO ADDRESS THAT THANK YOU MODERATOR YOU CAN HAVE THE HOSE LINE FOR DA STUFF INTO A ANSWER CENTER JACKSON'S QUESTION. ONE MOMENT PLEASE. THE LINE IS OPEN PLEASE GO AHEAD. THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATOR FOR THAT QUESTION IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING- AS OF A FEW MOMENTS BEFORE THE HEARING BEGAN AT THAT THE- AMENDMENT TO WASN'T TAKEN AND THAT WHAT THIS SECTION DOES DIFFERENT IS ON AT THE- OF AND THIS WOULD MAKE IT. BOB BLUR PUNISHABLE BY A MISDEMEANOR OR BY- LOCAL JAILED ELEVEN SEVENTY SENTENCE OF FIVE SIXTEEN MONTHS TWO OR THREE YEARS AND LOCAL JAIL NOT A STATE PRISON. AND SO THIS BILL AS OPPOSED TO THE PAST- DOES HAVE A GRADUATED CONSEQUENCE SO THAT FOR THE ORGANIZED PORCH PETER THAT ARE INTRUDING ON PEOPLE'S- PLAYS AT. THEIR WELL BEING AND MY MIND- THAT THERE IS A GRADUATED CONSEQUENCE- THE- YEAH THE OTHER THAT PROP. FOR SEVEN. WE MORE AT THE AT BILL TO HAVE GRADUATED CONSEQUENCES FOR PETTY THEFT SO THIRTY PASSED THE FIRST TIME OR THE HUNDREDTH TIME IN ANY GIVEN YEAR WOULD STILL BE A MISDEMEANOR- AND WOULD NOT EVER GRADUATE TO A FELONYMATTER HOW MANY TIMES. ONE OF THE- THIS BILL DOES IS IT TRACKING NICE IS THE IMPACT OF PORCH PIRACY ON AND I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO KNOW WHAT IT EIGHT PROBABLY AFFECTS PEOPLE OF COLOR AND OFF LOWER ECONOMIC STATUS THAN IT WOULD DO THE WEALTHY WHO CAN ORDER AND RE ORDER THEIR PACKAGES AND SO THOSE ARE THE PEOPLE MOST AFFECTED. MAY I GET CLARIFICATION MADAM THOUGHT MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE AUTHOR DID IN FACT REMOVE THE WATER BLUR SO IS THAT ACCURATE YES CORRECT THE THOSE AMENDMENTS ARE BEING OFFERED TODAY IN A AND I'M WILLING TO ACCEPT THEM OF THAT. HELLO THE- TWO GET POSITION OF MOVING THE BILL FOR. WELCOME MAT. THAT IF THAT'S THE CASE THEN THIS BILL DOESN'T DO ANYTHING MORE THAN A PETTY THEFT WOULD DO BECAUSE IF YOU'RE CONVICTED OF THIS ONE TIME OR FIFTY TIMES IT'S STILL A MISDEMEANOR- AND SO I. WHAT'S AT THE PENALTY IS THE PENALTY WILL BE THE SAME IS THE- AS I UNDERSTAND IT MAY I MASS FOR CLARIFICATION THAT MADAM CHAIR WILL THE PENALTY BE THE SAME. AS IF THIS WERE INDEED A PETTY THEFT. I BELIEVE SOBRE OUTSIDE I RETURNED TO MY COMMITTEE CONSULTANT TO SEE IF. I CAN GET A CLARIFICATION ON THAT. THERMOS KENNEDY. THE BUT THE WEATHER THE PENALTY IS GOING TO BE THE SAME I THINK THAT- YOU KNOW LET ME CONFIRM WITH STELLA BUT THEY I BELIEVE THAT- THEY'RE SIMILAR OFFENSES THE DIFFERENCE HERE IS THERE'S DIFFERENT PROOF ELEMENTS SO THE PENALTIES WILL BE SIMILAR BUT HERE YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO PROVE THE INTENT TO STEAL RIGHT AND THAT WAS MY NEXT QUESTION HAVING. BEEN A PROSECUTOR. LONG TIME AGO NONETHELESS I REMEMBER THAT SPECIFIC CONTENT CRIMES ARE HARDER TO PROVE IN GENERAL INTENT CRIMES IN GENERAL INTENT CRIME AT YOUR SHOW THAT THE ACT WAS DONE THAT'S THE END OF IT YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO ON. AND OF THE- OF THE PERPETRATOR. AND THAT IS THE SORT OF IT HOW DO WE PROVE INTENT AS I UNDERSTAND IT THIS. THIS BILL TALKS ABOUT INTENT RIGHT- BUT WHAT DOES THAT MEAN ATTENTION OF THE POSSESSION OF A OF A BOX CUTTER OR OTHER PACKAGES AND I WOULD RESPECTFULLY. DISAGREE WITH THE NOTION THAT RICH PEOPLE CAN GO OUT AND READ BY THINGS I THINK THAT IF THE STAFF- AND I THINK THAT WE HAVE TO RESPECT THAT. THE VICTIMS OF THAT THE F. BUT I CHEST I'M HAVING TROUBLE SEEING WHY WE NEED TO ADD THIS PARTICULAR. OFFENSE WHEN WE ALREADY A PETTY THEFT AND WE ALREADY HAVE THE ABILITY TO CONNECT WITH THE SAME PUNISHMENT THAT THAT NOW THIS WOULD MOVE FORWARD I THINK YOU ON A KEY TOPIC THERE THE INTENT. AND THEN I ALSO APPRECIATE YOUR CALM. IN A RECORDING EIGHT OF THE VICTIMS I WAS SURPRISED IN IN STE THE RADIO BUT I DID THIS IS. TENS THERE'S- ONE OF THE COMMENTS FOR LISTENERS I. AM DON'T REMEMBER WHAT MEDIA MARK WAS IN. BUT WHAT IF THE PERSON TAKING PACKAGE NEEDS AND THE PER IN ORDER THE PACK. I LIKE I DON'T I DON'T KNOW HOW TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION YOU KNOW- BUT BACK TO YOUR QUESTION ABOUT INTENT IN IF SUMMER WANTS TO JUMP IN HERE WITH A BETTER LOCATION. I'M HAPPY TO DO THAT BECAUSE THAT HAS COME UP A COUPLE TIMES AND- AND I AND I APPRECIATE THAT IT IS MORE DIFFICULT TO PROVE CONTENT WE- DISCUSS THAT- WHEN WE ARE. INTRODUCING THE KEY TRACK. I THINK CURTILAGE. AND THEN. FENCE AND SO YOU'VE GOT. AND THEN AS SUMMER- ALLUDED TO THE ORGANIZATION. ASPECT OF THIS WHEN YOU PUT ALL THOSE TOGETHER. I THINK THAT'S WHEN THE AND I'M NOT I'M NOTBEEN A PROSECUTOR- NOR. FORTUNATELY EVER PROSECUTED SO I AVEN'T LIVED THAT EXPERIENCE- I DON'T THINK THEY GO HAND IN HAND. SO I THINK YOU KNOW IT'S UP TO THE PROSECUTOR IN LAW OBVIOUSLY LAW ENFORCEMENT TO PUT THOSE THINGS TOGETHER I THINK THAT ALSO ADDRESSES. TURNS AT THE WITH. OUR OF. APPROACH IN IN AND AT. YOU KNOW ALL THOSE OTHER THINGS AS WELL THAT. THIS IS ALREADY A HARD THING TO PROVE. AND SO YOU'RE HAVING TO HAVE- A PERSON. OFFENDED ME MULTIPLE TIMES FOR THIS TO COME INTO FACT BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO ENTER THE CURTILAGE WHICH IS A DEFINED. AS DIFFERENT FREE TO- DOMICILE BECAUSE HE DOMICILED. THIRTY I JUST LEARNED THIS I SAW LIKE EXPERT I'M REALLY NOT BUT YOU KNOW FOR A SINGLE FAMILY HOME THE CURTILAGE BEGAN BEGINS WITH YOU CROSS OFF THE PUBLIC SIDEWALK UNDER THE PERSONAL PROPERTY AND AN APARTMENT IT'S DIFFERENT IT'S AT THE DOOR YOU KNOW THE NOT ALWAYS OF THE BUILDING AND YOU'RE NOT IN THE CURRENT. AGE OF THAT HOME- SO. I THINK WHEN YOU PUT ALL THOSE THINGS TOGETHER AND THEN OTHER ASPECTS OF THE- CASE INDIVIDUAL CASES I THINK IS WHEN YOU ARE ABLE TO DEVELOP INTENT. THE PROBLEM IS IF I'M IN AND OUT OF THE FOR THE NEXT. QUESTION THE PROBLEM IS IT'S STILL PETTY THEFT WHETHER THEY'RE IN YOUR CURTILAGE OR NOT AND I IT JUST SEEMS TO ME WHILE RECOGNIZING THAT THESE KINDS OF PETTY THEFTS ARE OCCURRING. MORE AND MORE FREQUENTLY- AND- APPALLINGLY SELF FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS- IT SEEMS THAT WE HAVE THE ABILITY NAY. TO PROSECUTE AND PERHAPS THE QUESTION TO THE TO THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY IF I MAY IS. WHY IS IT OUR PERSPECTIVE IS A PROSECUTOR WHY DO YOU BELIEVE THAT GIVEN THE FACT THAT THE- DEFENSE IS GOING TO BE MISTER. THIRTY WOULD THAT YOU WOULD CHARGE THIS IS LIEU OF A PETTY THEFT CHARGE IF YOU WERE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND PROSECUTE SOMEONE WHO WAS ACCUSED OF COMMITTING. THE OFFENSE. MODERATOR WILL ALLOW- DA CHEF AND TO ANSWER. THANK YOU SENATOR AND I APPRECIATE YOUR EXPERTISE AND BACKGROUND IN THIS- THIS PARTICULAR- SENATE BILL A PROPOSED SENATE BILL MAKES THE PUNISHMENT A ONE YEAR AS OPPOSED TO THAT ATTY THAT. MAKES THE PUNISHMENT AS SIX MONTHS PUNISHMENT IT ALSO BRINGS IT INTO CONSISTENCY WITH A COMMERCIAL BURGLARIES DOES AND TRAINING LIKE A WALMART OR A DIFFERENT PLACE WITH THAT INTENT TO STEAL YOU STILL HAVE TO SHOW WHY YOU WERE THERE BUT YOU COULD LIVE AND SHOULD BE ON THE FIRST AND- PRIOR HISTORY. I TAKING OF FORTUNE. SO YOU KNOW HOW TO WAIT TILL THEY COMPLETE BUT AND POLICE CAN BE CALLED AN ACTION CAN BE TAKEN JUST BY VIEWING THAT THE PERSON IS ON YOUR PROPERTY AND YOU KNOW IS A PERSON YOU DON'T KNOW WHEN IS A PERSON THAT. HAS THE TOOLS OR THE THINGS OUR TRUCK WAITING FOR THEM SO IF POLICE WERE TO INVESTIGATE THEY'RE ABLE TO NOT HAVE TO WAIT TILL THE PROJECT CARRIES AWAY THE- ITEMS THAT THEY STOLE AND ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY PULL FROM A DOOR TO DOOR. FOR ABLE TO STOP THEM BEFORE GET THE BEST CAN OUR THIRD DOOR SO THE FACT THAT THERE IS AN EIGHT PLEASE. TO ONE YEAR VERSION. AND AS A- OR YOU AT THAT THE JOY WOULD HAVE THE DISK AS WHAT WOULD THERE NO MAN MINIMUM BEING. AND THE FACT THAT IT LAWS FOR. THE GOOD THAT'S NOT TO BE COMPLETED IN THE PERSON TO GET AWAY AND THE VEHICLE BUT TO HAVE- A PERSON CALL ABOUT. SOMEONE TRYING TO TAKE THEIR PACKAGES AND THEN USE THAN NORMAL EVIDENCE THAT WE HAVE FOR A VARIETY OF INTENSE WE DO COMMERCIAL BURGLARY OR POTENTIAL BURGLARY IT ALL. TO SOMEBODY BE FOR THE ABLE AND THEIR PRIOR INCIDENTS AS EVIDENCE OF ANY. ARE ALL IT WOULD ALLOW US TO CHARGE THAT FULLER. AFTER IF THAT'S SIMPLEST ROUTE TO GO YES DEFINITELY WE IT WAS ONLY A ON- ASKING FOR THE ANSWER TO THE ONE QUESTION THAT CONNECTION I GET CLARIFICATION YOU MENTION AS I'VE GOT THREE OTHER MEMBERS WHO WANT TO ASK QUESTIONS AND I HAVE. A PHONE ON THE PHONE. OKAY KLAY HERE VERSUS SIX MONTHS AND THE ABILITY FOR A LOT. IS THAT NOT NAY AVAIL IN ANY THEFT. IT IS BUT YOU HAVE TO ACTUALLY HAVE THAT THE PAST MEANING YOU'VE TAKEN THAT PACKAGE AND YOU ARE- YOU ARE DONE YOU'VE STOLEN AS OPPOSED TO SOMEBODY WHO IS- THE PERSON WHO COMES BACK TO YOUR POOR AND TAKES BACK **** THEY TAKE THEM. THANKS ARMS LET ME BEFORE WE ASK ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS JUST BECAUSE WE NORMALLY HOWEVER WITNESSES FIRST LET ME HAVE THE MODERATE.

ALL RIGHT THANK YOU APPRECIATE THAT LET US CONTINUE WITH THE QUESTIONS FROM THE DíAS I BELIEVE THE CITY CENTRE RITUAL LOTS OF SENATOR MORE LOCKED IN SENATOR BRADFORD AND THEN SENATOR WIENER BUT THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR WE ARE SEEING AN AMAZING- TRENDS NEW TRENDS AND ECONOMICS IN TECHNOLOGY- ONE WE'RE SEEING A LOT MORE SHIPPING IN THE OTHERS WERE SINGING BRING. PROVIDE WERE YOU ACTUALLY GET TO SEE WHO'S AT YOUR PORCH. ED'S VIDEOTAPED IN AND THEN IT JUST. SEEMS TO BE SENT OUT PUBLICLY BUT WE'RE EVEN SING IT BY OUR AIRPORT WHEN I LANDED THEY JUST BUILT UP WAREHOUSE IN MONTHS TWO YEARS AGO. THE OTHER TWO MORE WAREHOUSES. HELLO THIS AREA ALONG. IT'S JUST A AN AMAZING- SIGHT TO BEHOLD SO THESE VIDEOS GET SENT TO THE-NEWS STATIONS AND SO WE GET TO SEE SOMEONE WALKING RIGHT UP TO THE PORCH AND THEN TAKING SOMETHING AND THEN WALKING AWAY AND IT IT'S- IT'S ALMOST REPLACE CAR CHASES. THE NIGHTLY NEWS SO I. FIND THIS REAL FAST BECAUSE WHEN YOU BRING IT UP PEOPLE REACT STAGES A MOSTLY REACT TO LIKE. YEAH THIS IS JUST NOT RIGHT THAT PEOPLE ARE TAKING STUFF RIGHT OFF OF OUR- PORCH IS IN FACT WE'RE SEEING VIDEOS OF. PEOPLE FALLING DELIVERY TRUCKS LIKE PRIME FED EX UPS AND IT'S RIGHT THERE OFF ON TV YOU CANNOT GOING THIS IS INCREDIBLE. I'M SEEING YOU TO DEALS ON. PUTTING IN GAG STUFF INSIDE A BOX JUST TO HAVE SOMEONE STILL WOULDN'T YOU KNOW IT GETS SURPRISE WHEN IT'S OPENED- EVEN WITH THE VIDEO IN INSIDE TO SEE THEIR REACTION OR- ARE WE'RE SEEING OBVIOUSLY TRACKING DEVICES AS WELL THE- TO CATCH THESE PEOPLE TOLD. SOME OF THE MORE DISTURBING. VIDEOS WE SEE ON TV IS WHEN HOMEOWNER ACTUALLY CONFRONTS THAT THE FRONT AND A COUPLE OF THESE ARE NOT BEEN PRETTY. SO I'M- CONCERNED I BROUGHT IT UP YOU KNOW WHAT ONE OF MY PRESCRIPTIONS ARE BY IN ALL THESE CRITICAL. IS THAT PEOPLE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT SO. CENTER JONES I'M I'M REALLY GLAD YOU BROUGHT SOMETHING FORWARDED IT SHOWS THAT SACRAMENTO'S. REACTIVE YOU KNOW WANTS TO DO SOMETHING TO TRY TO ADDRESS- THIS PARTICULAR SITUATION BECAUSE I EIGHT AFTER WATCHING THESE NEWS CLIP SIDE I HAVE EVERYTHING FOR ME DELIVER TO MY DISTRICTOFFICE. YOU KNOW GIVES YOU DON'T PUT IT MY DOOR YOU YOU ACTUALLY BRING IT BY SIGHT DO THE SAFETY PURPOSE. GLAD SO I JUST AND WHEN TIME IS RIGHT MADAM CHAIRMAN MOVE THE BILL. A BECAUSE I THINK. WE NEED TO ADDRESS THE SITUATION SOME FORM OR FASHION AND I THINK IT SHOWS THAT SACRAMENTO'S AWARE AND IS ADDRESSING. THE SITUATION SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. ARTS CENTER BRADFORD THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND I TO- ONE APPLE SOME CINNAMON SORT OF BEEN STATED THERE'S NO DOUBT WITH THE INCREASE OF HOME DELIVERY- SERVICES THAT THERE HAS BEEN AN INCREASE AND PORTS PIRACY BUT A GREAT CONCERN TO KEEP AN WITH. ADDING ADDITIONAL I'M ARE ENHANCEMENT I THINK WE KNOW THE HISTORY OF WHOSE PRIMARILY IMPACTED BY ALL THESE INCREASE CRIMES AND ENHANCEMENTS AND I THINK WE HAVE. BUT AT THE STATE YOU IN WINNING CRIMES AND HAVE IT DOESN'T THE TEAR CRIME IN ANY SHE FORM OR FOR. BUT I THINK WHAT REALLY GETS ME BECAUSE pWE JUST WITNESSED AND GEORGIA. OR YOU SAW A YOUNG AFRICAN AMERICAN MAN JUST SIMPLY ENTER ON UNOCCUPIED HOUSE. AND RESIDENTS TO GET UPON THEMSELVES TO BE JUDGE JURY AND EXECUTIONER AND I'M FEARFUL THAT THE EXPANSION OF THESE CRIMES WILL ONLY EMPOWER THOSE FOLKS WHO. ALREADY HAVE. BIASES AS IT RELATES TO POOR MINORITY PEOPLE SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY'RE IN THE WRONG NEIGHBORHOOD SO- I CAN'T SUPPORT THIS SITE TO AGREE THAT LIKE I SAY THERE'S AN INCREASE IN ON PORTS. AND PIRACY BECAUSE OF AN EXPANSION OF DELIVERY SERVICES BUT I JUST THINK ON THE LAWS THAT ARE CURRENTLY ON THE BOOK CLEARLY ADDRESS THE CONCERNS ARE TRYING TO ADDRESS. THANK YOU. SENATOR WIENER. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR WHEN I FIRST SAW THIS BILL I WAS INTRIGUED BY IT IS BECAUSE THIS IS A VERY REAL ISSUE I DON'T WANT TO. DOWNPLAY THAT IN ANY WAY I KNOW JUST FOR THE HOUR THIS IS BEEN GOING ON FOR AWHILE BACK WHEN I WAS IN THE WERE SUPERVISORS I GOT REGULAR. DIFFERENT HORRIBLY PRESS PACKAGE ARE WOULD BE STOLEN AND THIS ISN'T ABOUT NOT HOLDING PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE PEOPLE WHO STEAL SHOULD BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE AND- AND THE CURRENT LAW DOES ALLOW FOR THAT AND AS I READ THIS LAW THE MAIN DIFFERENCE. WE GOT A CLEAR FIVE. IS IT DOES INCREASE THE PENALTY- AND FROM SIX MONTHS TO SOLELY ONE YEAR ON I DON'T YOU KNOW IT TOO. GO IN AND TRY TO CLOSE LOOPHOLES TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE. COMMIT CRIMES ARE HELD ACCOUNTABLE WE WE'VE BEEN DOING TRYING TO WORK AROUND AUTO BURGLARIES- WELL. SUCCESSFULLY THIRTY ONE PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR BEHAVIOR- BUT INCREASING THE PENALTY I DON'T. DOES THE E. R. THE RIGHT PATH HE SIX MY IS STILL BUT I THINK PAY QUITE IMPACTFUL. SENTENCE AND IF SOMEONE'S DOING IT REPEATEDLY THOSE ARE SEPARATE CRIMES EACH OF WHICH SUBJECT TO SIX MONTHS SO I'M I'M NOT CALL FOR PRESENT. BUFFY FIVE THE BILL IS A THIS LEGISLATION TODAY. SEVEN MITCHELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH I JUST AGAIN I AGREE WITH EVERY THE STATE WITH EVERYONE HAS MADE THIS IS OF CRIME OPPORTUNITY AND IT'S UNFORTUNATE I TO STOP THE PROBE SOLUTION ACTUAL CRIME YOU KNOW. MY COLLEAGUES TALK ABOUT THAT WE WILL. THIS BILL DOESN'T APPLY TO BECAUSE THE VIDEO WE SEE ARE ONCE. THIS ACTUALLY STOLE AND ITEM. IT'S WHEN THEY ACTUALLY TAKEN THE ITEM FROM THE PORCH AT ARE LEAVING. MY CHALLENGE WITH THE BILL- IT IS IT'S MULTI FOLD YOU KNOW FIRST OF ALL YOU KNOW THIS NOTION OF YOU TO WRITE TO HIM BECAUSE OF THE RING RING QUE. CARE MUST ALSO. CAPTURE IMAGES OF PEOPLE WALKING. ON THE PUBLIC SIDEWALK AND SO THIS NOTION OF RIGHT TO PRIVACY IS REALLY A TWO WAY STREET I DON'T KNOW OF THE EXTERIOR OF MY FRONT DOOR- AS THE SUPPORTING WITNESS- PARK. THE SAME. YEAH I. PERSONAL IT TIED MY FRONT DOOR WITH REGARD TO INTENT. WE HAVE HAD LOTS OF CONVERSATIONS IN THIS COMMITTEE WITH REGARD TO INTENT OPTICALLY AROUND SINCE ENHANCEMENTS ARE AT IT AND I'VE BEEN TO UNDERSTAND THAT THAT. YES THAT INTENT IS WE UP TO THE DISCRETION OF THE ARRESTED AUTHORITY AND- TIMES IN MY EXPERIENCE IN THIS WILL BE DEAL WITH INTENT YOU ALREADY HAVE POSSESSION OF WHATEVER. IS TO SELL ITS INTENT TO DO SOMETHING WITH SOMETHING YOU ALREADY HAVE A SESSIONS NO. IN TO COME. A ROBBERY AGAIN I WOULD HAVE CONCERN IN THAT INTENT WOULD BE TO FIND- BY. A WILL OF TO THE REST WITH ALREADY. LASTLY I WOULD JUST ADD. YOU KNOW THERE ALSO ARE. YELLS ONLINE IF YOU LOOK WHERE- YOU KNOW PEOPLE QUESTION THE RIGHT OF CERTAIN PEOPLE TO BE THE SPACE. IN FOR MISS YOU TOO THE ELVES OF PEOPLE USING A KEY ENTERING BUT CURRENTLY OF THEIR APARTMENT BUILDING AND BEING ASKED WHAT YOU DOING HERE. AND WHAT YOU'RE WHAT APARTMENT YOU THE END WHEN THEY HAVE USED THE PASS KEY TO GET IN THE EXTERIOR DOOR AND SO PERHAPS THE- HE CELLPHONE IN THE NEW RING CAMERAS HAVE GIVEN US ALL A SENSE OF. SOME OF FORTY THE WE CAN TAKE A FOR US OFF THE COURT IN THE OUR INTENT. OTHER I VISIT THIS I THINK FOR ALL THOSE REASONS I'M NOT COMFORTABLE THIS MEASURE I THINK DOESN'T TRULY ADDRESS THE ISSUE AND- OUR STATE. I HAVE NO PROBLEM SOME THIRTY CURRENT LAW GRAND THEFT IF IT'S OVER AND HUNDRED DOLLARS BUT BUT PUT IN THE HANDS OF THE ARREST A SORTIE THE DISCRETION TO DETERMINE WHETHER MY PRESENCE THERE SUGGESTS INTO THIS BILL I TWO FOUR FOR THOSE REASONS I WILL BE SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY. NO OTHER COMMENTS FROM MY COLLEAGUES ON THE DICE I'D LIKE TO MAKE A COMMENT BEFORE YOU CLOSE SO WHEN AT. IN OUR- NEW ODD PANDEMIC CIRCUMSTANCE AND- WHEN WE WERE- FIRST SITTING BILLS FOR THE- HEARING I DIDN'T HAVE ACCESS TO THE COMMITTEES HOUSES I CERTAINLY HAS TO THE BILL. AND REPORTER END UP. IN IT I WAS NOT FULLY AWARE OF THE- OF WHAT ARE THE OTHER EXISTING STATUTES AND BASICALLY THE BILL WOULD BE TO COMPARE AS IT'S BEEN DISCUSSED HERE WHETHER WE ARE STATUTES ARE ADEQUATE NOW THERE'S CERTAIN. YOU THE AUTHOR AND THE DS. MAY YOUR CASE AS TO WHY YOU THINK THEY ARE INADEQUATE HOWEVER I AFTER REVIEWING THE ANALYSIS AND ESPECIALLY THE DEBATE DAY. IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THIS IS. WELL I CAN CERTAINLY APPRECIATE SOME PEOPLE FEELING THAT THIS IS REALLY NECESSARY IT IN FACT SEEMS REDUNDANT AND THE ISSUE OF. BEING ABLE TO ALLOW SOMEONE PROSECUTED FOR INTENT THAT IS A VERY DIFFICULT THING TO PROVE I'M VERY COMFORTABLE SOMEONE BEING PROSECUTED BECAUSE THEY STOLE PACKAGE EVEN IF THE PACKAGE WE ON THE FRONT LAWN. SO THE CURTILAGE ISSUE IS ON IF YOU SEE. THE ISSUE OF WHETHER YOU HAPPENED TO BE THERE. WITHIN TEN OR NOT IS A VERY HARD IS A VERY SUBJECTIVE AND SO IN BOTH LISTENING TO THE DEBATE AND AFTER I WAS EIGHT. THE ANNOUNCES BY. YEAH I CAN'T SUPPORT THE BILL IN ITS CURRENT FORM AND I DO APPRECIATE AND I THINK BY WHEN MY STAFF IN OUR FIRST TALKING ABOUT IT I AM VERY AWARE THAT THERE IS MORE TO SUPPORT PIRACY. FIRST THIS IS A KNOW CAN BE CITY. ON FOR. HOWEVER THEY CAN STILL BE PROSECUTED FOR THE CRIME IF THEY STEAL THAT ARE. THAT PACKAGE SO. THINK OF EXPLAIN WHERE I'M COMING FROM BUT CENTER JONES YOU MAY CLOSE THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS AND FIRST OF ALL I WANT TO A ALLEGE SENATOR AND FURS CONCERNS OF. SANGRE YOU HAD A PERCENT THAT. SITUATION IN GEORGIA IS UNACCEPTABLE AND AS A SOCIETY AND AS A CULTURE WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO. CONTINUE TO THOSE ISSUES.

THANK YOU BOB MORE OF MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE- SENATE BILL BY ELEVEN ELEVEN AMENDS CALIFORNIA LAW TO PERMIT YOU TO STAY IN JUVENILE FACILITIES.

AGE EIGHT TO TWENTY ONE WHOSE CASES ORIGINATED IN AN ALL COURT SHOULD BE IN ADULT JAILS. IT CREATE PRESUMPTION FOR KEEPING NEWS AND JUVENILE FACILITIES AND REQUIRES THAT A JUDGE DECIDE WHETHER YOU MAY BE MOVED. PROVIDES GUIDANCE FOR A JUDGE'S DECISION CURRENT LAW PROVIDES NO STANDARDS FOR THIS DECISION. OF THE YOUTH TO BE MOVED TO AN ADULT JAIL IF THE JUVENILE FACILITY SAFELY CARE FOR THEM OR IF THE PHYSICAL SPACE COULD NOT COMMENT ON OLDER POPULATION. SIMPLY BY SALAS THE RULES FOR DIFFERENT. OF YOUTH INCLUDING YOU AND YUBA COURT. AN YOUTH WHO HAVE BEEN ORDERED TRANSFERRED TO THE ADULT COURT. OF THE VAST MAJORITY OF INCARCERATED YOUTH IN CALIFORNIA ARE HELD IN COUNTY LEVEL FACILITIES. IN HIS MAY REVISION THE GOVERNOR PROPOSES TO SHUT DOWN THE DEPARTMENT OF JUVENILE JUSTICE FACILITIES.

WE'LL QUEUE UP FOR PHONE OPPOSITION ONE AND THEN ZERO THE ONLY REASON I WENT STRAIGHTTO THE PHONE LINES IS BECAUSE THERE'S NO- NO ONE IS IN THIS ROOM.

ALL RIGHT- ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE DíAS SENATOR MORE LIKE GO AHEAD. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. I VOTED FOR SB ONE NINETY AND I JUST. OF SOME CONCERNS OF THIS BECAUSE IT WAS PROSPECT OF A NOT. A NOT ADDRESS THE PRIOR BALANCES- SO WE'RE DOWN TO EITHER. EIGHTEEN OR TWENTY TWO COUNTIES DEPENDING ON. WHO'S PROVIDING THE DATA BUT I HAVE. TWENTY TWO COUNTIES TRYING TO COLLECT ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY SIX MILLION ONE OF THE SPEAKERS SAID IT'S DOWN TO EIGHTEEN COUNTIES TRYING TO COLLECT FOR THREE MILLION. M. O. R. RECEIVED. MOST OF THE CANCER JUST UNILATERALLY DECIDED JUST TO DROP THE WHOLE THING AND- IT SHOULD BE A LOCAL BOYS. AND SO THAT'S COMMENDABLE. I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THOSE THAT ARE STILL. TRYING TO COLLECT THAT WERE DRESSING HERE. AND SO I HAVE DATA OF COUNTYSPENDING ALMOST AS MUCH AS THE AMOUNT THEY'RE TRYING TO COLLECT AND I I'M JUST SORT OF CURIOUS SENATOR ALSO. HAVE HAVE THESE COUNTIES SOLD THE RECEIVABLES. LIKE EIGHTY CENTS THE LADY TOOK EIGHTY SEND HER CUT JUST SOLD A TWENTY CENTS AND SO THERE'S A COMPANY THAT BOUGHT THESE. ACCOUNTS ARE COLLECTING ON THEM. I'M JUST SORT OF CURIOUS WERE. OR IS IT ALL JUST STAFF DRIVEN WHERE THEY'VE JUST BEEN. MAKING PHONE CALLS AND SENDING LETTERS. THE CENTER MORE LIKE I AM NOT SURE OF THE ANSWER I JUST KNOW THAT THE END RESULT IS THAT IT'S NOT WORTH THE TIME AND THE MONEY THAT'S BEING SPENT TO TRY TO COLLECT UP ON IT IT'S JUST THAT IT'S NOT WORTH IT SO I DON'T SPECIFICS I. ANY OF. IF SEVEN COMBOS MOVIE WOULD YOU HAVE ANY MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE. YEAH SURE AND SO MOST OF THIS THAT ARE ACTUALLY ALL THE FAT IS NOT SENT TO PRIVATE COLLECT AGENCIES IT'S ALL THE WAY STAND THAT COUNTY REVENUE DEPARTMENTS THAT YOU CALL CAN. I THAT SHOW THAT'S WHY WHEN YOU SEE YOU ORANGE FOR EXAMPLE IS SPENDING AND EIGHTY CENTS ON THE- THEIR SPENDING AND THAT MY MONEY ON STAFF. TRYING TO COLLECT MONEY AND GET PROCEED AS- I THAT KIND OF WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AND YEAH THE UPDATED NUMBER. IN EIGHTEEN COUNTY THE FORTY THREE NOT AND I WILL SAY. 85% OF THAT IS HELD BY ORANGE AND TULARE COUNTY. MORE THAN THAT SINCE OUR REPRESENT ORANGE COUNTY LIVING. NOT DEFENDED BUT LET ME ASK YOU ABOUT IT IF THEY'RE SPENDING EIGHTY TWO CENTS. ON THE DOLLAR THEY'RE GIVING OUR LEAVING EIGHTEEN CENTS ON THE TABLE BY NOT PURSUING- THE AMOUNT OF. THESE BILL'S ARM WOULD THAT BE THEN A ARE A REIMBURSABLE MANDATE WHERE THEY COULD APPLY TO THE STATE AND SAY HEY GIVE US EIGHTEEN CENTS ON. WE'RE I DON'T THINK SO. THERE IS ANYBODY WHO HAS A MORE MORE LEGAL ANSWER TO THAT. IF YOU DON'T MIND CENTER MORE WATER WILL CALL IN SENATOR MITCHELL'S CARRIED A BILL AND SHE MAY HOUSES SUBJECT MATTER EXPERT BRED SENATOR MITCHELL THANK YOU SENATOR MORLOCK- I DON'T KNOW ABOUT ALL THAT BUT I DID SPEND QUITE A BIT OF TIME ON THE ISSUE WITH SOME OF THE FOLKS ON THE PHONE. WHAT I'D SAY ON SEVERAL GO MOST TROUBLE THAT MANY OF THE COUNTIES THAT CARRIED THE- BOMB- HIGHEST DEAD IF YOU WILL WE'RE ALSO COUNTIES THAT WEREN'T FOLLOWING CURRENT LAW AT THAT TIME AND WE'RE PURSUING PEOPLE WHO CURRENT LAW WAVED FIND. ARM AND SOUL- I DON'T REMEMBER ORANGE COUNTY SPECIFICALLY IF THEY WERE ALL QUITE FRANKLY ONE OF THE OFFENDERS BUT THAT WAS WHAT WE FOUND MOST TROUBLING THAT PEOPLE WERE ALREADY BEING FINED- YOU KNOW. GIVEN GIVEN. COVER UNDER CURRENT LAW THAT SAID IF YOU WERE LOW INCOME AND THAT CERTAIN CRITERIA THAT YOU SHOULD BE WAVE CHARACTER PURSUING EVERYBODY ON. I APPRECIATE YOUR PERSPECTIVE THAT IF THE STATE MANDATE SAYS THAT WE ELIMINATE FINES AND FEES BUT THAT'S NOT THE PRACTICE THAT. IN THE COUNTY SEVEN GATE A GOOD NUMBER OF COUNTIES HAD VOLUNTARILY STOP THE PRACTICE BEFORE WE EVEN INTRODUCED THE BILL TWO YEARS AGO BECAUSE THEY FOUND THAT VERTICALLY WITH WITH REGARD TO JUVENILES IT WAS COUPLE IN THEIR ABILITY TO REUNITE WITH THEIR FAMILIES AND ALL JUVENILE LOCKED TALKS ABOUT THE WHOLE POINT IS TO REUNIFY AN IMPROVISED AT THE PORT OF OPPORTUNITY FOR THE- FAMILIES. RESEARCH SHOWED UP AND- WERE COMPLICATED. I AGREE TO YOUR BILL. AND SO THAT'S RAIMES TO GET OKAY FINE STOP IT YOU KNOW IT'S NOT WORKING FOR A GOOD NUMBER OF REASONS. BUT WE DIDN'T MAKE IT RETROACTIVE SOON ITS ANOTHER SISTER RECEIVABLE ON THE BOOKS WRITTEN. HARD TO COLLECT IN. MOST MANAGERS SO SAID LET'S NOT SPENDING MORE MONEY ON THIS BECAUSE IT'S NOT WORTH THE TIME AND SENATE CLAIRE'S CASE. SPENDING MORE THAN THEY'RE RECEIVING SO THAT ALL MAKES SENSE BUT- FOR THOSE COUNTIES THAT SOMEHOW HAVEN'T COME TO THAT CONCLUSION WE'RE NOW UNILATERALLY SAYING TO A LOCAL BODY. YOU WILL. RIGHT OFF YOUR RECEIVABLES. END OF DISCUSSION. AND I'M I'M WONDERING WHY SHOULD WE DO THAT TO A LOCAL AGENCY. WHEN THEY CAN DO IT ON THE ROAD. AN THROUGH THE CHAIR YOU MAY ANSWER MITCHELL. SORRYSENATOR ALTHOUGH. HE WAS LOOKING AT ME THAT'S WHY I LEAN BACK IN I HE RIGHT I SEE YOU BUT YOU KNOW AND THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN OUR DESIRE IN THE ORIGINAL BILL- BUT WE WERE CLEAR THAT WE WERE- FOLLOWING THE NATIONAL BRAND AND WANTED TO STOP COLLECTION FROM POINT AND THE GOLD EXTRA STEP. WHICH UP. COUNTIES THAT HAVE NOW COME ON. FAQ ANNUAL ALSO WORK THAT YOU KNOW THE COUNTIES BEGIN TO COOK BEGAN COLLECTING THESE FINES AND FEES DURING A TIME WHEN THERE BUDGETS WERE REDUCED- AS A RESULT OF STATE CUT BACKS AND SO IT BECAME. A EIGHT HM ISSUE AS OPPOSED TO WHETHER IT REALLY IS FOR THE MILLIE THE RIGHT THING TO DO AND SELL ONLY INTRODUCED A BILL AND SEVENTEEN IT WAS DURING A TIME WHEN- LOCAL COFFERS WERE CERTAINLY MORE FLOOD NAY HAD BEEN IN THE PREVIOUS TEN YEARS. A AGAIN LOOKING AT THE RESEARCH. PROPONENTS ON THE PHONE RECOGNIZING HOW MANY COUNTIES WERE ON COLLECTING UNDER CURRENT LAW INAPPROPRIATELY AND THAT WAS THE REAL PUSH. AND SO I HEAR WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS WHETHER NOTS IT'S APPROPRIATE TO FORCE COUNTIES TO NOT COLLECTED A RECEIVABLE ON I GUESS THAT'S JUST YOU KNOW THE MATTER OPINION ON THEY THERE'S RESEARCH THAT SUGGESTED IT WAS AND PROBABLY AN INAPPROPRIATE ACTION TO TAKE IN THE FIRST PLACE. TO BE PERFECTLY HONEST I AM AND WE WILL. AT BUT IT WAS OF THE LAW AND SO THEY DID WHAT THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO DO AND- AND SO NOW I JUST WONDER IF THERE'S A WAY TO SPLIT THE BABY LIKE. WE'LL GIVE YOU TO FOR THE REMAINING QUE. TEN CENTS ON THE DOLLAR. AS OPPOSED TO JUST TAKING IT ALL AWAY- AND THAT'S JUST THAT'S WHERE I'M HAVING. MAYBE THE BUSINESS HANGOVER BUT ALL THAT. AND AGAIN I WANT TO SAY THAT AT THE STATE LEVEL YOU KNOW IT WASN'T A STATE. LAW THAT. MANDATED THAT THEY COLLECT THE FINES AND FEES IN THE FIRST PLACE. THOSE ARE DECISIONS MADE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. BUT WHAT IS IF THEY FOR. COLLECTING FINES AND FEES. BECAUSE THE STATE. REQUIRED THAT THEY DO SO. NOT BUT NOW IT'S STATE COMING IN SAYING ROOM THOSE LAWS. SO WITH THE JUST SORT OF A UNIQUE. SITUATION OF SACRAMENTO VERSUS LOCAL AND I'M JUST TRYING TO FIND YOUR AVAILABLE. CENTER MORE LIKE YOU YOU MAYES IF THERE'S ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS TO THE AUTHOR YOU MAY BUT IN THE MEANTIME I AM TRYING TO GET AN ANSWER TO THE SPECIFIC QUESTION OF WHETHER THIS BILL. AND HOW IT IS CONSTRUCTED AS SENATOR TO THERE HAS PRESENTED. WHETHER THAT CREATES A STATE REIMBURSABLE MANDATE OKAY SO I'M TRYING TO GET THAT ANSWER FOR YOU AND WILL- I DON'T THINK IT DOES- THE- BUT I AM TRYING TO GET THAT ANSWER OKAY. SO SIR MARK HAVE ADDITIONAL QUESTION TO THE AUTHOR NO I DO NOT THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF A AND E'S CENTER DRUGS SO LIKE I INDICATED AYE AYE THE- THIS DOES NOT SHOW AND I DO THINK THAT THIS THE ACTION.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR DRESSER WILL NOW TURN TO OUR LAST STOP TURNER CLASS BILL SB ELEVEN THIRTY THREE SENATOR JACKSON WHICH YOU CAN DO RIGHT FROM THE DíAS AND- THE- PORT WHERE. IS YOUR ON THE POST. OUR CHURCH KEVIN BRIZILL. AND BELOW ARE AT MICHAEL BLOW WILL BE IN PERSON NOT ON THE LINE BUT- GO AHEAD SENATOR JACKSON'S. PRESENT THANK YOU OF MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS I APPRECIATE THE INDULGENCE TO ALLOW TO GO LET. OUR THIS MEASURE POSTPONES THE SUNSET DATE ON A LAW THAT REDUCES THE NUMBER OF PEREMPTORY CHALLENGES AFFORDED IN MISDEMEANOR MISDEMEANOR TRIALS. I WILL BE ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS THAT POSTPONED THE SUN SETTING OF EXISTING LAW FOR PERIOD OF THREE YEARS. NOW IN A CRIMINAL TRIALBOTH THE PROSECUTOR AND DEFENSE ATTORNEY ARE PERMITTED TO CHALLENGE JURORS THAT THEY BELIEVE TO BE UNFIT TO SERVE THESE CHALLENGES MAY EITHER BE FOR CAUSE OR CHOSE ROOM THREE CHALLENGES. IN A FOR CAUSE CHALLENGE THE IT IS QUESTION POTENTIAL JURORS TO ELICIT ENOUGH INFORMATION TO CONVINCE THE JUDGE THAT A JUROR IS NOT QUE OF RENDERING AN IMPARTIAL VERDICT. OBSERVE LATE THE JUDGE MRS. THAT THE DOES NOT GO AGAINST PEREMPTORY CHALLENGES STILL AVAILABLE ON THE BASIS OF JUST SIMPLY A DECISION THAT YOU DON'T LIKE. THE LOOK THE ANSWER YOU STILL ARE ENTITLED TO REMOVAL FOR PEREMPTORY CHALLENGES THAT ARE NOT AT THE EXPENSE. IN ANY WAY OF THE CAR FOR A PRINTER CHALLENGE SO. ARE AGAIN AN ATTORNEY CAN SIMPLY DISMISS IT. AJ PEREMPTORILY WITHOUT GIVING ANY. TO SEE. IN MISDEMEANOR TRIALS AGAIN NOT TOUCHING OF DISMISSAL FOR COSTS SO THIS NUMBER OF SIX IN MISDEMEANOR TRIALS HAS BEEN THE LAW FOR JUST OVER THREE YEARS PRIOR TO THAT THE CAP ON THE PEREMPTORY CHALLENGE NUMBER WAS TEN. THE LAW OF THE REDUCES THE NUMBER OF PEREMPTORIES IN THESE CASES FROM STAND TO SIX IS DUE TO SUNSET JANUARY OF JANUARY FIRST OF NEXT YEAR. NOT THE SUNSET DATING TENSION CONTAINED IN THIS MEASURE ELEVEN THIRTY THREE THE NUMBER OF PEREMPTORIES WILL RETURN TO THE YES RULE OF TEN FOR MISDEMEANOR. WITH GREAT THAN THE DAYS AND- OF FOUR MISDEMEANORS WITH PENALTIES OF NINETY DAYS OR LESS. AS YOU WILL HEAR FROM LOS ANGELES SUPERIOR COURT PRESIDING JUDGE KEVIN BRAZIL. OUR JUDGES FEEL VERY STRONGLY THAT THE REDUCED NUMBER OF PEREMPTORY CHALLENGES RESULT IN MORE EFFICIENT CORD ADMINISTRATION WITH NO DIMINUTION OF THE RIGHTS OF CRIMINAL DEFENDANTS. COURTED ASIAN IS MORE FISH AS YOU WERE JUROR. WANT TO SERVE IN A- WHEN NUMBER OF PEREMPTORY CHALLENGES DECREASES. INDEED IN A STUDY BY THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL. HE FOUND THE 6% DECREASE IN THE NUMBER OF JURORS CALLED SINCE THE NUMBER OF PEREMPTORY WAS REDUCED. THAT 6% OUT TO BE TENTH. CITIES WHO DO NOT NEED TO BE CALLED FOR JURY THE- EVEN TODAY PARMON SO. DISTANCE IT IS LAW THE COURTS WILL HAVE. GETTING POTENTIAL- STEVEN REPORT FOR SERVICE ADDITIONALLY THE FEWER PROSPECTIVE JURORS THERE ARE THE CITY. ROOMS WILL ADMINISTRATION OF OUR JURY SYSTEM THIS IN LIGHT AND THE TREMENDOUS BACKLOG IN TRIAL THAT WE HAVE IN THE COURTS. OR THE COLD TEEN SITUATION. THIS WHOLE STUDY WHEN THE PEREMPTORY LIMIT WAS SET AT TEN AND I THINK THIS IS INTERESTING TO NOTE THE AVERAGE NUMBER OF PEREMPTORIES. WITH HER THAN SIX BY EACH ATTORNEY AND THE MAXIMUM WAS REDUCED TO SIX THE AVERAGE DROPPED OF FOR THE DEFENSE ATTORNEYS WERE RARELY USING MORE THAN THE SIX TO WHICH WERE ENTITLED NO BY THE WAY. VERY IMPORTANT. IN ANY WAY FIVE WAR CAN. TURN ANY OTHER IN. THAT THE REDUCED NUMBER OF PEREMPTORIES IS DAMAGING TO CRIMINAL DEFENDANTS I BELIEVE REDUCING THE NUMBER OF PEREMPTORY CHALLENGES WILL IMPROVE JUDICIAL ADMINISTRATION AND REDUCE IT IS RESISTANCE TO JURY SERVICE WELL HAVING NO EFFECT ON THE RIGHTS OF CRIMINAL DEFENSE. AT THE MENTIONED. ON THE LINE. OF MISTER OF BELOW HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THIS MISSION. OUR MODERATOR YOU CAN ALLOW A JUDGE BRAZIL ON THE HOST LINE TO.

HAD SENT A RICH YOUR COMMENTS GO AHEAD APPRECIATE THAT I DON'T HAVE A QUESTION I JUST CONVERSATION WITH THE- AND I. MUST ACKNOWLEDGE UPDATE IT NOT TO IS ABSOLUTELY RIGHT IT WAS DROPPED IN THE BUDGET BILL I IN THE- TENTH OUR SERVER IS AGO WHICH IS HOW WE- GOT TO WHERE WE WERE- IT WAS IT. LATE COULDN'T GET THROUGH AND- THE SENATE CHOSE TO ACCEPT THAT AND SO I THINK IT THAT. YOU KNOW CURRENT LAW WORK IN THE CITY DID NOT GET ALL HEARING PUBLIC POLICY. BECAUSE IT WILL THE PUBLIC POLICY ISSUE. UP FULLY APPRECIATE- THE NOTION OF ECONOMIES ANY FISSION CITIES- FROM MY PERSPECTIVE BASED ON THE DISTRICT I REPRESENT I THINK CAN TRUMP DUE PROCESS. AND FULLY HERE MONEY THAT THE CHIEF JUSTICE WILL BE DOING. I HAPPEN TO READ. REPORT CONDUCTED BY THE- NYU SCHOOL OF LAW THEIR CIVIL JURY PROJECT THAT TALKS ABOUT UNDERSTANDING BY US ACROSS THE BOARD IN JURY SELECTION PROCESS AND TECHNOLOGY EVERYBODY TO A POINT WHERE- JURIES ARE TRULY A JURY. YEARS WERE EMPLOYED BIAS WAY INTO THAT PROP I THINK IT IS REQUIRED WORK. THE FULL. IF CHALLENGES RIGHT I HOPE THAT A PART OF ULTIMATELY GET SAYS THERE THE COVERT NINETEEN CHALLENGES REAL AND I HOPE THE COURTS ACROSS THE STATE ARE BEGINNING TO THINK ABOUT TALK ABOUT HOW THEY'RE GOING TO ADDRESS UP I DON'T KNOW THE BILL SIGNIFICANT IMPACT YOU STILL HAVE TWELVE JURORS IN EUROPE YOU CAN'T THIS. WE'RE GOING TO BUILD. ALLEN PORTS THAT AGAIN I HOPE. THE BILL MAKES THAT BIG A DIFFERENCE ALL OF WITH REGARD TO A RESPONSE TO CALL IT NINETEEN AND FOR ALL THOSE REASONS I WON'T BE VOTING TODAY I THE BILL. FOR CERTAINLY SENATOR JACKSON ME SO WHEN THIS WAS- IN. PUT IN A BUDGET BILL AS AS THE CHAIR OF THAT PARTICULAR SUBCOMMITTEE WE DID NOT HEAR IT AND- WE DID NOT GET TO SEE A LANGUAGE IN THE TRAILER BILL UNTIL AFTER CLOSER HEARING. AS FAR. WORD IN A I EXPRESSED MY ARM OFF AT THAT POINT TO THE AND TO THE STAFF THAT NO CHEATING BUT IT WAS- FIFTY EIGHT GET THROUGH SO IT'S OBVIOUS IS THE POLICY. WHAT WE HAVE ASSIST IT. AND I APPRECIATE THAT WE REALLY ARE UNDER THESE AT I WILL NEVER CALLED PRESIDENT SINCE WE'VE HAD A PLAGUE PANDEMICS ORBITS. THEN ARE LIFETIME THIS IS. AND WE KNOW THE DATE MAKING THE AND MANY MANY FACTORS ARE. A VERY DIFFICULT TO DO ASSEMBLY. COOL IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO VENTURE A COURT ROOM RIGHT NOW- I COULD RESHAPE PERHAPS AN EXTENSION OF ONE WE'RE JUST GIVEN THE ENDEMICS DANCE BUT AS IN THE TERM MISTIMED ONLY HOPING THAT WE WILL NOT BE IN THIS CIRCUMSTANCE WOULD HAVE LIKE EIGHTEEN MONTHS. IF THIS YEAR'S WHEN WE KNOW THAT WE ALREADY HAVE THAT WHEN WE LOOK AT THREE MAKE UP WHEN WE LOOK AT WHO SHOWS UP. WHO IS STEPHEN ALLOWED TO SERVE. WE ALREADY HAVE A SITUATION WHERE OUR JURIES AREN'T NECESSARILY REPRESENTATIVE. OUR POPULATION AS A WHOLE AND SO TO REDUCE THE PEREMPTORY CHALLENGE. DOES CREATE A SITUATION WHERE THE DID IT JUST RESTRICTS THE ABILITY FOR THE TO HELP ENSURE THAT THE JURY POOL REALLY REFLECTS. THE YOU KNOW IF THAT TYPE OF DEMOGRAPHICS IN THE FEAR PROCESS SO I. A WOULD STAY OFF OF IT RIGHT NOW BECAUSE I WOULD NOT BE COMFORTABLE TO EXTEND IT FOR THREE YEARS. YES CENTER MOORLACH. SENSORS A SO MUCH OPPOSITION NIGHT I WOULD JUST LOVE TO MOVE THIS BILL. AND I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE THE SUPPORT BY REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUE IN DOING THAT. THANK OKAY FOR IF I MAY RESPOND YES LAWYERS FOR A GO AHEAD SAM JACKSON IBM. I APPRECIATE THE PASSION WITH WHICH THE- PUBLIC DEFENDER ADVOCATES ON BEHALF OF THEIR CLIENTS BUT I ALSO APPRECIATE. OF THE JUDGES ARE THERE TO DO JUSTICE. AND THE I DON'T THINK ANYBODY DISAGREES ABOUT THE NOTION IT IS IMPORTANT TO HAVE A FAIR AND IMPARTIAL JURY. THAT IS CRITICS. AND I BELIEVE THAT IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES AND THE WHAT WE'VE SEEN OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS AND WHAT YOU HEARD THE PRESIDING JUDGE OF THE LOS ANGELES SUPERIOR COURT ARTICULATE IS THAT IN FACT THIS IS A PROP AS THE US WORK. AND IF YOU COULD JUST STICK. PRIOR TO THE REDUCTION FROM TEN TO SIX. THE AVERAGE NUMBER OF PEREMPTORIES AN ATTORNEY WOULD USE IN A MISDEMEANOR CASE WAS FIVE POINT TWO FOR THE PROSECUTOR AND FIVE POINT SEVEN FOR DEFENSE ATTORNEYS. SO THE DATA SHOWS THAT THEY DON'T USE TEN ANYWAY. AFTER THE LIMIT WAS REDUCED TO SIX THE AVERAGE DROPPED TO THREE POINT NINE PERCENT. OR THREE POINT NINE PEREMPTORIES FOR PROSECUTOR AND FOR PEREMPTORIES FOR DEFENSE COUNSEL OUT. THERE IS THE ABILITY IN A CASE FOR AN ATTORNEY TO REQUEST THAT THE ID NUMBER OF PEREMPTORY SHOULD BE EXTENDED SO THIS DOES NOT PRECLUDE. THE ABILITY TO HAVE ASK FOR A AND FOR A COURT IN DOING JUSTICE WHICH IS THE JOB OF THESE JUDGES. OUR TO A LOT OF FOR A PEREMPTORIES. THE NOTION THAT. WE ARE BALANCING EFFICIENCY AGAINST JUSTICE IS JUST SIMPLY NOT ACCURATE BUT I DO SHADE I WITH FORMER PROSECUTOR BUT ENHANCE WITH. WITH THE PUBLIC DEFENDERS AND DEFENSE ATTORNEYS EVERYBODY HAS A PASSION REPRESENTING THEIR POINT OF VIEW BUT THE ARBITER IS THE JUDGE. THIS IS A MEASURE THAT HAS OVERWHELMING SUPPORT BY THE COURTS NOT BECAUSE THEY THINK IT'S GOING TO REDUCE OUR JUSTICE IN FACT THAT IT'S NOT THE CASE. YOU HAVE NO IMPACT. IMPLICIT YES. YOU KNOW WE HAVE THE CHIEF JUSTICE'S CREATED A WHOLE EFFORT TO ADDRESS THAT PROBLEM WHETHER WE HAVE TEN PEREMPTORIES OR SIX ISN'T GOING TO ADDRESS THE IMPLICIT BIAS ISSUE THAT WE HAVE IN OUR SOCIETY SO TO TRY TO INFLATE THOSE TWO I THINK IS NOT AN ACCURATE WITH OF WHAT THIS BILL DOES I THINK THAT. PEREMPTORIES THIS IS CHARLES TO IT WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO THE PUBLIC DEFENDERS JUST AN OPPORTUNITY TO TRY TO PUSH THAT ENVELOPE- TO WHAT THEY PERCEIVED JUSTICE TO BE. AND I RESPECT THAT THEY ARE ADVOCATES THE ADVOCATE FOR THEIR CLIENTS WE HAVE THOUGH THE COURTS. SAYING THE DISPENSING OF JUSTICE IS NOT IMPAIRED AND AS WE LOOK AT THE FUTURE HERE. AND THE FACT THAT WE ARE IN THIS DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCE WHERE THERE WILL BE MANY JURORS PERSPECTIVE JURORS WILL NOT SHOW UP. IT'S ARE GETTING I'M AWARE OF MASS TODAY. ARM I THINK THAT THIS IS A REASONABLE MEASURE I WOULD LIKE I WOULD SUBMIT THAT WITH AN OPPORTUNITY TO REVIEW THE CASE AND THAT INITIAL REPORT THIS ED. OVER AGAIN WAS DONE IN THE PARTS OF THIS PROCESS I THINK THIS IS CHARGED- A DESIRE TO GO TO. THERE WERE. APPRECIATE THE FACT. HEARD AS AND MANY THINGS TO ALMOST ACT BUT THEY TURNED OUT TO A GOOD. I WOULD SUBMIT THAT THIS IS INDEED A GOOD MEASURE. BECAUSE IT WILL ALLOW US THE OPPORTUNITY BOTH ADDRESS THE REALITIES OF THE CURRENT SITUATION IT ALLOWS FOR ADDITIONAL PEREMPTORIES IF IN FACT THAT IS WARRANTED. ARE WE ALSO KNOW THAT THE DATA ALONE AND I WOULD RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE I KNOW PUBLIC DEFENDERS WILL BRING UP LITIGATION FOR ANY PURPOSE. IF THEY FELT THAT THIS BILL WAS OR THAT THIS LAW AS IT EXISTS TODAY WAS UNCONSTITUTIONAL THEY WOULD HAVE BROUGHT AN ACTION TO TRY TO OVERTURN IT AND THEY NOT. OR IF THEY HAVE IT IS APPROVED SO ONCE WE COME OUT OF ALL THE- HI PER. TEN BECAUSE- AGAIN I. GET DOWN TO IS THE FACT THIS HAS BEEN WORKING. WE HAVE NOT SEEN AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF- OR THE PEOPLE GOING TO THE MAXIMUM POTENTIAL THERE IS THAT OUTLET IF THEY SHOULD NEED FOR ADDITIONAL PEREMPTORIES. STUDY GOING ON DO WITH A MUCH BROADER ISSUE OF IMPLICIT BIAS AND I BELIEVE THAT UNDER THIS CURRENT CIRCUMSTANCE WE ARE NOT SACRIFICE. THIS IN WAY SHAPE FORMIN FACT OF. GIVING OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM AN ONGOING BASIS WILL ALLOW US TO BE ABLE TO ACCOMMODATE THE NEEDS OF. THE THOSE PAST THIS AND THOSE SEEKING JUSTICE AND WITH THAT I WOULD ASK FOR YOUR IPHONE. BETTER WIENER. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- THIS IS A THERE ARE FRANKLY GOOD ARGUMENTS ON BOTH SIDES THIS BILL THIS IS NOT IT'S LIKE A CLEAR CUT BILL I'M I'M GONNA BE ROOTING. BILL TODAY. I HAVE NEVER. TRY I CRIMINAL CASE SO I'M WAS THIRTEEN THE CIVILITY I DID. IF YOU CIVIL JURY TO SO I PICKED QUITE A FEW. BY JURIES- BY- PEREMPTORY CHALLENGES ARE AN ODD THING AND I THINK SOMETIMES THEY ARE IN MY EXPERIENCE OVER RATED ONE THEY'LL GET USED TO SPEAKING WITH A MASK ON. ON OFTEN- BASED ON STEREOTYPES GOOD AND BAD I AM VERY BAD- SOMETIMES THEY ARE SAFETY VALVE WHEN YOU HAVE A JUDGE CLEARLY SHOULD HAVE A- BECAUSE AND DIDN'T DO SO AND THAT HAPPENS AND PEREMPTORY IS A SAFETY VALVE IT IS VALUABLE HI. BUT OFTEN THEY ARE BASED ON. NUMBER OF TIMES IN MY EXPERIENCE AS A TRIAL ATTORNEY WHEN I WOULD END UP. YOU HEAR YOU END OF THIS USING SOMEONE NEW AND UP WITH SOMEONE EVEN WORSE. SO SOMETIMES YOU UP REALLY DAMAGING YOUR OWN. CASE BUT THE NUMBER OF TIMES WHERE YOU END UP WITH SOMEONE ON YOUR JURY WHO YOU THINK IS YOUR WORST NIGHTMARE. HE WON I'VE BEEN GREATER. ADVOCATE OR- YEAH. IT HAPPENS ALL HI SO THIS PRINTER THEY CAN BE VALUABLE AS WHEN I WAS TRYING A CASE I WANT AS MANY COULD POSSIBLY HAVE BUT I OFTEN ENDED UP BUT AS I GOT MORE EXPERIENCED I USED A FEW HARM FEWER HIS EYES SO AND SOME HAPPY TO SUPPORT THE BILL TO.
