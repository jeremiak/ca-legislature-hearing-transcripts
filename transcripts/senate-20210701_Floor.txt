HIGHS THIRTY THREE KNOWS FIVE THE BUDGET BILL IS APPROVED MOVING ON TO ITEM NUMBER TWENTY EIGHT MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE READ. ASSEMBLY BILL ONE FORTY ONE BY THE ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE ON BUDGET AN ACT RELATING TO CANNABIS AND MAKING APPROPRIATION THEREFORE TAKE EFFECT IMMEDIATELY BILL RELATED TO THE BUDGET CENTER SKINNER THE FOR YEARS. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT MEMBERS AB BUDGET TRAILER BILL WHICH ESTABLISHES THE DEPARTMENT OF CANNABIS CONTROL AND CONSOLIDATES THE EXISTING CANNABIS LICENSE ENTITIES INTO A SINGLE ENTITY AND THE EXISTING ONES NOW ARE UNDER THE BUREAU OF CANNABIS CONTROL DEPARTMENT OF FOOD KNACK IN THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH INSTEAD THEY WILL ALL BE PART OF THE DEPARTMENT OF CANNABIS CONTROL. THE BILL ALSO ESTABLISHES THE FRAMEWORK FOR CANNABIS TREAT SAMPLES EXTENDS THE PROVISIONAL PROGRAM SUNSET DATE JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY SIX AND THE PROVISIONAL LICENSES WOULD OTHERWISE SUNSET AT THE END OF THIS YEAR ON JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY TWO HOWEVER WITH THE EXTENSION IT ALSO ESTABLISHES TANGIBLE GOAL POSTS FOR LICENSEES TO ACHIEVE CERTAIN BENCHMARKS WHILE THEY ARE UNDERGOING THEIR ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE. THE TEN OF THE BILL IS NOT TO DISRUPT AGREEMENTS THAT LOCAL JURISDICTIONS HAVE MADE WITH THE STATE TO COMPLY WITH SYKORA AND IT ITS INTENT IS TO HELP THE PROVISIONAL LICENSEES MOVED INTO ANNUAL LICENSURE SO ON THIS NOTE THERE'S BEEN DISCUSSIONS WITH THE ADMINISTRATION AND WE'VE ALREADY MADE SOME AGREEMENTS AND TO LET. OUR OTHER HOUSE TO MAKE SOME CHANGES IN THE CLEAN UP TRAILER BILL INCLUDING FOR SUBSEQUENT RENEWALS AFTER JULY-FIRST TWENTY TWENTY THREE THERE IS CLARIFICATION ON HOW TO DEMONSTRATE COMPLIANCE WITH SEQUEL FOR LOCAL JURISDICTIONS THAT HAVE MADE AGREEMENTS ON DOT COMPLIANCE THAT ARE NOT CURRENTLY ENVISIONED WITHIN THE BILL BEFORE US. AND WILL ADD LANGUAGE IF SECRET IS COMPLETE THAT THEY ARE NOT SUBJECT TO COMPLY WITH THE SEQUEL BENCHMARKS IN THIS BILL. AND WITH THAT I ASK FOR YOUR VOTE. SENATOR HIM ON. THANK YOU AT IT MEMBERS AT THIS IS A IF THE TRAILER BILL THAT'S DEFINITELY NOT PERFECT IT'S A COMPROMISE AND A SOMEONE WHO REPRESENTS A DISTRICT THAT AT ONE POINT HELD ONE THIRD OF THE LEGAL LICENSES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- BUT WE HAVE HAD A QUITE A NUMBER OF EXPERIENCES- IN TERMS OF BOTH THE SUCCESSES BUT IMPERFECTIONS OF THE BALLOT INITIATIVE- WHEN VOTERS PASSED PROPOSITION SIXTY FOUR IN TWENTY SIXTEEN- EVERY COUNTY TOOK A DIFFERENT PATH AND WE HAVE FIFTY DIFFERENT COUNTIES. SANTA BARBARA COUNTY THAT I REPRESENTS WITHIN FIRST THE FIRST FOUR MONTHS OF THE LAW BEING PASSED. WAS ABLE TO APPROVE EIGHT HUNDRED DIFFERENT LICENSES IN THE FIRST FOUR MONTHS- AND THAT IS HOW WE ENDED UP BEING A COUNTY THAT HAD SO MANY OF THE LICENSES. AND ON THIS FLOOR IN THIS BODY HAS TALKED SO MUCH ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE. OF ALLOWING FOR SMALL GROWERS SMALL CULTIVATORS AT TO HAVE A STAKE IN THE GAME- TO ENSURE THAT THIS INDUSTRY IS ONE THAT SUPPORTS ALSO. UNDER REPRESENTED COMMUNITIES AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AND THE REALITY IS THAT FOUR YEARS LATER. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE SEEN IN OUR DISTRICT AND I THINK THAT THIS TRAILER BILL ADDRESSES IT IT'S SOMETHING- RELATED TO STACKED LICENSES. BUT CONCEPT THAT MANY BIG GROWERS HAVE MULTIPLE SMALL LICENSES- IN ORDER TO GET NINE HUNDRED ACRES A HUNDRED AND SEVETY FIVE HUNDRED AND FORTY SEVEN ACRES NINETY ACRES BIG. ACREAGE FOR THEM NOW THE BALLOT INITIATIVE TO TRY TO PREVENT THIS TRY TO ENSURE THAT WE WOULD HAVE SOME OF THE SMALL GROWERS BE COMPETITIVE IN THIS. AND SO FOR THESE REASONS AT THIS PARTICULAR TRAILER BILL AS IT RELATES TO THE SMALL LICENSES- AND IN THE STACKED LICENSES SPECIFICALLY PUTS A LIMIT ON THIS WE HAD FOR YEARS- FOR FOLKS TO COMPLETE THE PROCESS BOTH AT THE LOCAL JURISDICTION. AND AT THE STATE LEVEL AND THE COULD THE IDEA WAS NEVER THAT BIG COMPANIES WOULD SWEEP UP THE LITTLE ONES IT WAS NEVER THAT IDEA BUT THE REALITY AND THE DATA SHOW THAT THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING- WHICH COULD COMMUNITIES WHERE WE HAVE BEEN VERY GENEROUS FOR WE HAVE TRIED TO DO THE RIGHT THING. IMPLEMENT THE LAW AND SO I WANT TO POINT THAT OUT BECAUSE I KNOW THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF DISCUSSION AND I THINK THAT NOW THIS BODY HAS A DIFFERENT DILEMMA. THE DILEMMA OF NOT JUST THINKING ABOUT HOW WE MOVE. FROM THE UNLICENSED- E. NO COMMUNITY TO GET THEM TO BE LICENSE BUT ALSO HOW WE DO RIGHT FOR ALL LOCAL COMMUNITIES IN TERMS OF ENSURING THAT THE IDEA BEHIND. THIS BALLOT INITIATIVE TO ALLOW A COMPETITIVE FIELD AMONG ALL PRODUCERS GROWERS- THE- EASE IS ACTIVE AND I THINK THAT THAT'S WHAT WE'RE SEEN SO I KNOW THAT THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF DISCUSSION IN THIS BODY AND I WANTED TO THE SPECIFICALLY RAISES. BECAUSE THE ISSUES THAT THAT HAPPENED IN ONE COUNTY ARE NOT THE SAME- IN OTHER COUNTIES SO WHEN WE'RE DEALING WITH FIFTY EIGHT DIFFERENT COUNTIES- WE HAVE SOME SERIOUS DISCUSSIONS TO BE HAD. ABOUT HOW WE ENSURE- THE BALANCE BETWEEN THE COUNTIES THAT WE DON'T WANT TO PROVE ANYTHING BUT ALSO THE COUNTIES- WHO HAVE BEEN EXCEPTIONALLY GENEROUS AND ARE NOW SEEN THAT THE SPIRIT OF THE VOTERS- IS IN JEOPARDY. BECAUSE PEOPLE HAVE FIGURED OUT HOW TO GO AROUND SOME OF THE PROCESS SEASON I WANT TO SAY THAT AS IT RELATES TO SEEK WELL. SANTA BARBARA COUNTY DECIDED TO DO- A PROGRAMMATIC ER BECAUSE IT'S FASTER IT WOULDN'T BE THAT PLACE AND EVEN WITH THOSE. ELEMENTS IN PLACE OF TRYING TO HELP PEOPLE GO THROUGH THE PROCESS FASTER WE'VE HAD THESE CHALLENGES SO I WANTED TO MAKE SURE TO SHARE THAT WITH FOLKS- AND ENCOURAGED AS DISCUSSIONS MOVE FORWARD. WE TRY TO FIND A WAY TO ENSURE THAT ALL KEY FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES- WE DEAL WITH IT I THINK THE UNINTENDED REPERCUSSIONS. OF THE BALLOT INITIATIVE. FOR FIFTY DIFFERENT COUNTIES WHICH I KNOW IS VERY DIFFICULT SO- WITH THAT TIME I WILL BE SUPPORTING AT THIS. PARTICULAR TRAILER BILL AND I LOOK FORWARD TO ONGOING DISCUSSIONS. SENATOR DOLLY. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT MEMBERS SO WE HAD LINK THE DEBATE ON THIS BILL YESTERDAY. AND I JUST WANT TO REFLECT ON SOME OF THE COMMENTS FROM MY FROM THE LAST SPEAKER I'M THE ONLY FARMER I BELIEVE LIKE. ON THIS FLOOR. TEN WE ABIDE BY ALL LOT OF A LOT OF DIFFERENT RULES BUT W HAD A PROPOSITION THAT PUT US IN THIS SITUATION. AND WE TALKED ABOUT THAT YESTERDAY BUT- INTEL WE THE PERSONAL I THINK I'M GONNA LAY OUT THIS BILL AGAIN BECAUSE IT'S NOT COOKING WE'RE GOING TO PUSH IT THROUGH AND WE'RE NOT GOING TO GET WHAT WE WANT. I DIDN'T WISER HURRY WISER HURRY NOT TO SLOW DOWN AND REALLY TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT WE HAVE HERE I THINK WE SHOULD SLOW DOWN AND WE SHOULD DO THIS TRY TO DO THIS RIGHT IS NOT GOING TO BE PERFECT. ANYWAY I HAVE. TWO DAYS AGO WE HAD A FIRE THE LAB ARE YOU PROBABLY ALL KNOW IN SISKIYOU COUNTY. BERNIE INTO ILLEGAL. POT GROWS IN. THERE WAS A SHOOT OUT. N. ONE PERSON DIED. SO IN AWE AND ARE COUNTIES WE HAVE ONE CODE ENFORCEMENT OFFICER FOR COUNTIES THAT ARE FORTY FIVE HUNDRED SQUARE MILES YOU CAN'T POSSIBLY DEAL WITH THE ILLEGAL GROWS THAT ARE HAPPENING SO THEY'RE COMPETING AGAINST THOSE LEGAL GROWS. THAT YOU HAVE IN YOUR AREA SEMI TALK ABOUT SMALL FARMERS VERSUS BIG FARMERS LOOK THIS IS CALIFORNIA YOU BETTER GROWTH YOU'RE GOING TO BE A FARMER YOU'RE NOT GONNA STAY IN BUSINESS BECAUSE OF ALL THE REGULATORY LAWS THAT ARE PASSED. IN THIS BODY SO FOR ME I WANT TO SAY WE NEED TO NUMBER ONE. WE NEED TO WORK ON. GOING AFTER THE LEGAL GROWS BECAUSE IF YOU HAVE IF YOU DON'T ENFORCE ILLEGAL GROWS YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET THE GUY THAT'S TRYING TO BE LEGAL WHO'S PAYING THE MONEY. AND GOING TO THE REGULATORY PROCESS THAT WE SET UP. HE CAN'T COMPETE WITH THE ILLEGAL PRODUCT THAT'S COMING ALL OVER CALIFORNIA SO. I'M GONNA LAY OFF AYE I SUGGEST THAT WE WAIT THERE'S NO REASON TO HURRY ON THIS WE NEED TO. SPEND SOME MORE TIME AND DO IT RIGHT IS WHAT I SAID. IN THE THERE ARE BUDGET HEARING. LET'S TAKE OUR TIME THE DEVIL'S IN THE DETAILS AND LOOK YES T'S PROBLEMATIC BECAUSE OF PROP SIXTY FOUR IS NOT EASY AND YOU'RE RIGHT. EVERY COUNTY DOES SOMETHING DIFFERENT. BUT UTIL WE FOR STILL HELP COUNTIES TO ENFORCE ILLEGAL GROWS WE'RE NEVER GONNA GET THERE AND THESE LEGAL PEOPLE ARE GOING TO GIVE UP. THE CENTER FROM THE NORTH COAST BROUGHT UP SOME REALLY GREAT POINTS AND TRUST ME. THEY'VE BEEN GROWING MARIJUANA IN HUMBOLDT COUNTY. FOR I WAS BORN BUT I'M FIFTY FIVE THEY'VE BEEN DOING IT THERE AND THEY'RE TRYING TO BECOME LEGAL AND DO IT IN A REGULATED MARKET INTEL WE SLOW DOWN AND DO IT RIGHT WE'RE GONNA END UP WITH THE SAME EXACT THING AND WE'RE NOT GOING TO GET WHAT WE ASK FOR SO I ASK THAT WE STILL. DO NOT PASS THIS BILL AND GIVE US SOME TIME TO DO IT RIGHT. SENATOR BRADFORD. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT PRESIDENT I TO RISE WITH GREAT CONCERNS ON THIS MEASURE- A MEASURE THAT HAS BEEN CLEARLY DEBATED AND I COMMEND OUR BUDGET YEAR FALL OR WORK THE BUDGET COMMITTEE BOTH HOUSES- BUT I STILL THINK THERE'S GREAT CONCERN SPECIALLY WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE EQUITY ASPECT OF THIS MEASURE WHY IS IT THAT EVERY EQUITY APPLICANT HAS A PROVISIONAL LICENSE WHAT WE WANT TO CUT THE TIME FRAME OF THOSE EQUITY AYE A LICENSE YES. YOU'VE EXPANDED FOUR YEAR BUT AGAIN. BUT IT'S VERY LITTLE CONFIDENCE BECAUSE WE DO THE SAME THING TIME AND TIME AGAIN OF PROMISES PROMISES. DR MARTIN LUTHER KING STATED MARCH I WATCHED IN AMERICA'S CONTINUE TO RIDE A PROMISSORY NOTE. TO THE NEGRO THAT KEEPS COMING BACK AND SUFFICIENT FUNDS FOR WE ARE FIFTY SEVEN YEARS LATER AND WE'RE STILL GETTING PROMISSORY NOTES. AND COMING BACK WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY WE HAVE SPENT MORE MONEY ON ENFORCEMENT THEN WE TRULY SPENT. ON HELPING THESE EQUITY APPLICANTS WE SHOULD ALL BE CONCERNED THAT 80% OF ALL LICENSES IN THE SPACE INDUSTRY AND A HALF YEARS A CONTROLLED BY WHITE MEN. YEAH MINORITIES WOMEN DISABLED VETERANS STRUGGLE EVERY DAY BANNER THIS SPACE LEGALLY. AND WE'VE SPENT MORE AGAIN MORE MONEY ON ENFORCEMENT AND YOU CONTINUE TO CALL IT THE BLACK MARKET BUT IT'S NOT BLACK AND BROWN PEOPLE IN THIS MARKET THEY'RE NOT THE ILLEGAL GROWERS AND THEN YOU WANT TO CONTINUE TO WEAPONIZE SEQUEL. ON PEOPLE WHO ARE TRYING TO ENTER THE SPACE THIS IS WHAT PEOPLE ARE LEAVING CALIFORNIA. THE L. R. WHY SHOULD YOU BE TAPPED OUT A SEQUEL EXEMPTS I MEAN ARE. ALTERCATION JUST OPEN UP A DISPENSER MOTHER'S BUSINESS AFTAB SECRET APPROVAL TO OPEN UP A STORE MAKES ABSOLUTELY NO SENSE SO. I HAVE GREAT CONCERNS AND I KNOW THERE'S BEEN A GREAT NEGOTIATIONS AND COMMITMENTS MADE BUT AGAIN I LIVE LONG ENOUGH TO KNOW PROMISES ARE NOT REALITIES. SENATOR BATES. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT- I THINK I REMINDED MYSELF AND CERTAINLY MANY OF US OFTEN THAT WHEN GOVERNMENT MAKES PROMISES THAT NEEDS TO KEEP THEM OR WE LOSE THE CONFIDENCE IN OUR GOVERNMENTS AND I THINK WE'VE SEEN A LOT OF THAT IN THE PAST YEAR AND A HALF THE VOTERS WERE TOLD WHEN WE CREATED A LEGALIZED MARKET PLACE IN CALIFORNIA WE ARE GONNA SHUT DOWN THE ILLEGAL MARKET PLACE. WE NEED AN OVERWHELMING SHOW OF FORCE BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BY OUR GOVERNMENT TO ENSURE THAT THAT PROMISE IS KEPT TO THE PUBLIC THAT SHOW FOR SHOULD BE IN THE FORM OF LAW ENFORCEMENT AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION ENFORCEMENT WE SHOULD BE PROTECTING THE LEGAL MARKET PLACE WE SHOULD BE PROTECTING. VERY IMPORTANTLY ONE OF THE LARGEST GROUPS IN CALIFORNIA THAT HAVE INFLUENCE IN OUR LIVES THIS LEGISLATURE IS THE ENVIRONMENTAL COMMUNITY. WE SHOULD BE DEALING WITH THE ILLEGAL WATER DIVERSIONS THAT ARE WORSENING THE IMPACTS OF OUR DROUGHT WE SHOULD BE PROTECTING PUBLIC AND PRIVATE LANDS FROM ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION. WE SHOULD BE ELIMINATING THE ILLEGAL GROW SITES REDUCE THE RISK OF CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES AND WE SHOULD BE PROTECTING OUR WILDLIFE BIRDS MOUNTAIN LIONS THAT ARE AT RISK DUE TO THE ILLEGAL USE OF PESTICIDES AND RODENTICIDES. WE JUST SEEM TO TRY TO OUTLAW OF THOSE PARTICULAR- TESTIFIED THAT ARE NEEDED AND CAN BE APPROPRIATELY USE RATHER THAN GOING AFTER THE BAD ACTORS FOR USING THEM THERE USING THEM ILLEGALLY AND HARMING OUR WILDLIFE. TRULY DEALING WITH THE CANNABIS INDUSTRY MEANS DEALING WITH THOSE ISSUES IT MEANS INCREASING CRIMINAL PENALTIES IT MEANS PUTTING ILLEGAL GROW SITE OPERATORS IN PRISON IT MEANS MOST IMPORTANTLY AS WE'VE HEARD FROM OUR- GOOD SENATOR FROM BEAVER WHO ARE THEY HAVE TO. LIVE ALONG SIDE OF MUCH OF THE F. GIVE US RESOURCES RESOURCES FOR LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ARE ABSOLUTELY MANDATORY IF WE ARE GOING TO MEET THE PROMISES WE MADE TO THE PUBLIC IT REQUIRES AN ACTION PLAN AND IT REQUIRES ACTION FROM THE GOVERNOR'S ADMINISTRATION. AND THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE TIME IS NOW THE JOB NEEDS TO GET DONE IN THIS BILL DOESN'T GET US THERE. THANK YOU. SEEING NO FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE SENATOR SKINNER WOULD YOU LIKE TO CONCLUDE YES. THANK YOU. AS I REFERENCE THIS BILL WILL BE AMENDED AND I REFERENCE SOME OF THE AMENDMENTS AND ONE OF THE ADDITIONAL AMENDMENTS IS THAT. IT WILL CLARIFY. OR RATHER IT WILL YES WILL CLARIFY THAT THE HUNDRED MILLION. IN CANNABIS LOCAL JURISDICTION GRANT PROGRAM WHICH WAS ADOPTED THE BUDGET BILL WOULD BE DEPLOYED QUICKLY SO THAT IT CAN HELP LOCAL JURISDICTIONS MEET THE DEADLINES IN THE BILL WHEN I MENTION SOME OTHER THINGS IN THESE DISCUSSIONS ARE UNDER WAY. THE NECESSITY OF THE TIMING TODAY TO ACT ON THE BILL EVEN THOUGH WE KNOW THAT WE ARE GOING TO BE ADDING ADDITIONAL AMENDMENTS TO THIS BILL IS BECAUSE OUR BUDGET BILL. CREATED THE CONSOLIDATION OF THE DEPARTMENTS INTO THE ONE OFFICE OF DEPARTMENT OF CANNABIS CONTROL SO THAT IS WHY WE NEED TO ACT TODAY WHAT IS BEFORE US BUT WE WILL. SOON ACT ON THE ADDITIONAL THINGS I MENTIONED IN THE OTHER DISCUSSIONS THAT ARE UNDER WAY WITHOUT I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. INTEGRITY VERY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL.

AND THIS IS WHAT IT DOES IS IT EXTENDS AND EXPANDS THE STATUTORY RELIEF THAT WE PROVIDED TO OUR TRANSIT OPERATORS. IN THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET TO HELP THEM RECOVER FROM THE CODE NINETEEN PANDEMIC. AND ALL OF US KNOW. HOW MUCH THE FARE BOX THE FAIR INCOME DROPPED WITH THE UNDER THE PANDEMIC WITH SO MANY PEOPLE WHO NO LONGER THAN BY. ROAD TRANSIT AND THE HELP THAT THEY NEED. IT EXTENDS THE STATE'S DELEGATION AUTHORITY UNDER THE NATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION ACT THROUGH JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. IT PROVIDES FOR THE CREATION IN IMPLEMENTATION OF THE CLEAN CALIFORNIA PROGRAM. WHICH WILL ALLOCATE A BILLION DOLLARS OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS TO HELP CLEAN UP OUR ROADWAYS AND HIGHWAYS. IT PROVIDES STATUTORY FLEXIBILITY TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IN MEETING THEIR REQUIRED SPENDING LEVELS ON ROAD MAINTENANCE- AND WE KNOW THAT MANY THINGS WERE DISRUPTED. DURING THE PANDEMIC SO WE ARE GIVING THIS EXTENDED TIME PERIOD SO THAT THEY CAN CONTINUE WITH GOOD ROAD MAINTENANCE. AND PROVIDES FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A LIMITED PILOT PROGRAM.

SENATOR TROUBLED. SEVEN MINUTES ON THE SPELL AT THE DESK THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE READ THE AMENDMENTS AMENDMENTS BY SENATOR OCHO OF FOLK THAT ONE. SENATOR BOTH THE FLOOR'S YOURS. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT MEMBERS. CALIFORNIANS ARE CURRENTLY IN DURING THE HIGHEST GAS PRICES IN THE NATION AVERAGING FOUR DOLLARS AND TWENTY TWO CENTS FOR REGULAR GALLON OF GASOLINE WHICH IS MORE THAN A DOLLAR ABOVE THE NATIONAL AVERAGE. THE ADVERSE IMPACTS OF HIGH GAS PRICES AND TAXES THAT WE KNOW DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTS OUR LOW TO MIDDLE INCOME RESIDENTS NOT ONLY AFFECTS DRIVERS. IT INCREASES THE COST OF LIVING. INCLUDING BUSINESS COST AND FOOD PRICES HAMPERING OUR RELIEF EFFORTS AND ECONOMIC RECOVERY. TODAY JULY FIRST CALIFORNIA'S EXCISE TAX ON A GALLON OF GASOLINE WILL RISE TO FIFTY ONE POINT ONE SENSE. AT A TIME WHEN THE STATE BUDGET IS ENJOYING A HISTORIC SURPLUS CALIFORNIANS DESERVE A TAX BREAK NOT HIGHER TAXES. THE AVERAGE FAMILY OF FOUR PAYS AS MUCH AS EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLARS IN GAS TAXES A YEAR AND THIS INCREASE IS GOING TO COST CALIFORNIA DRIVERS AN ADDITIONAL EIGHTY THREE MILLION. DOLLARS IN THE NEXT YEAR ALONE. GAS COSTS ACCOUNT AGRICULTURAL SECTOR AND RAISING THE GAS TAX WOULD INHERENTLY RAISE THE PRICE OF FOOD. FURTHER RESULT IN NOT JUST A HIGHER TAXES THE PUMP BUT ALSO INCREASE COSTS AT THE CHECK OUT LINE. I GAS TAX HOLIDAY OR MORE SPECIFICALLY A FULL MORATORIUM ON CALIFORNIA'S GASOLINE EXCISE TAX BACKFIELD WITH GENERAL FUND. DOLLARS FROM THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWENTY TWO FISCAL YEAR WOULD PROVIDE MUCH NEEDED RELIEF FOR CALIFORNIANS. FOUR YEARS THIS LEGISLATURE HAS FAILED TO PRIORITIZE INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS IN ITS GENERAL FUND SPENDING RELYING ON BOND FUNDING FOR INCREASING TAXES.

THERE ARE STILL SOME OF US ON THIS FLOOR THAT SERVED IN THE LEGISLATURE DURING THE RECESSION AND HAD TO MAKE CUTS TO THE RATES THAT WERE PAID OUR PROVIDERS ARE DEEP PROVIDERS AND THOSE- CUTS HAVE NOT YET FULLY BEEN RESTORED EVEN OVER MANY YEARS PAST THAT RECESSION. SO MOST SIGNIFICANTLY WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS PROVIDES FOR THE SERVICE PROVIDER RATE REFORM WITH IN THE DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES SYSTEM BY PROVIDING PHASED IN RATE INCREASES OVER FIVE YEARS AND SHIFTS THE SYSTEM TO FOCUS ON CONSUMER OUTCOMES IN A PERSON CENTRED MODEL. AND I AM HOPEFUL THAT WE ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO MOVE UP THAT TIMELINE THAT FIVE YEAR TIMELINE TO A SHORTER TIMELINE- IN THE FUTURE IF WE SEE CONTINUED GOOD REVENUES IT ALSO IMPLEMENTS A LANGUAGE ACCESS AND CULTURAL COMPETENCY INITIATIVES WITHIN OUR DEPARTMENT OF DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES REQUIRES THE DEPARTMENT.

THE MONEY DID NOT FOLLOW TO THE LOCAL AREAS AND WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS REALLY TAKE US VERY FAR ON TE PATH TO DO WHAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN DONE AT THE TIME THAT THE STATE HOSPITALS CLOSE ADDITIONALLY THIS LEGISLATURE ADOPTED THE OPTION OF SELF DETERMINATION PLANS AND I BELIEVE IT WAS EIGHT YEARS AGO FOR PEOPLE IN LOCAL REGIONAL CENTERS THIS BILL CREATES AN OMBUDSPERSON THAT WILL WORK WITH FAMILIES TO EXPEDITE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THAT BILL THAT HAS NOT MOVED RAPIDLY OVER EIGHT YEARS.
