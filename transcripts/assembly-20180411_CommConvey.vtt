AND.

00:38:27.805 --> 00:38:30.275 region:rollup2
WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT IS OVER

00:38:29.107 --> 00:38:31.376 region:rollup2
THE YEARS IN THE PAST WE HAVE

00:38:30.275 --> 00:38:33.244 region:rollup2
BEEN SUPPORTIVE OF THE PROGRAM'S

00:38:31.376 --> 00:38:34.946 region:rollup2
BEEN A GOOD PROGRAM?

00:38:33.244 --> 00:38:36.814 region:rollup2
BUT IT DISTINCTION BETWEEN.

00:38:34.946 --> 00:38:38.850 region:rollup2
THE THE CARRIES OF LAST RESORT

00:38:36.814 --> 00:38:39.851 region:rollup2

00:38:46.925 --> 00:38:48.626 region:rollup2
SO IT'S UNDERSTANDABLE THAT THEY

00:38:48.126 --> 00:38:50.161 region:rollup2
WOULD HAVE SOME SORT OF

00:38:48.626 --> 00:38:52.330 region:rollup2
OBLIGATION.

00:38:50.161 --> 00:38:52.897 region:rollup2
AND SO WE WE PUT SUPPORT OF THAT

00:38:52.330 --> 00:38:53.598 region:rollup2
THE PAST SERVICE WAS REALLY

00:38:52.897 --> 00:38:53.898 region:rollup2

.

00:38:55.667 --> 00:38:58.703 region:rollup2
WHAT WE WERE LOOKING AT ON HIGH

00:38:57.035 --> 00:39:01.472 region:rollup2
COSTS FUND A PROGRAM SO THESE

00:38:58.703 --> 00:39:02.106 region:rollup2
ARE THE SMALL RURAL ILEX CENTER?

00:39:01.472 --> 00:39:03.374 region:rollup2
AT ABOUT THIRTEEN OF THEM IN THE

00:39:02.106 --> 00:39:06.644 region:rollup2
STATE.

00:39:03.374 --> 00:39:07.579 region:rollup2
AS WE EXPAND OUR FACILITIES OUT

00:39:06.644 --> 00:39:09.147 region:rollup2
TO THE RURAL AREAS AND HE'S ERIC

00:39:07.579 --> 00:39:10.915 region:rollup2
ROYER HAS BECOME MORE POPULATED

00:39:09.147 --> 00:39:12.483 region:rollup2
WE HAVE FACILITIES THERE SO WE

00:39:10.915 --> 00:39:14.152 region:rollup2
ARE IN SOME OF THESE THESE

00:39:12.483 --> 00:39:16.387 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES TODAY. AND ALL THAT

00:39:14.152 --> 00:39:18.056 region:rollup2
WE'RE ASKING IS THAT WE BE ABLE

00:39:16.387 --> 00:39:19.591 region:rollup2
TO EFFECTIVELY COMPETE WITH

00:39:18.056 --> 00:39:20.158 region:rollup2
EVERYONE ELSE BECAUSE IT DOES

00:39:19.591 --> 00:39:21.125 region:rollup2
AREAS ARE PROTECTED AT THIS

00:39:20.158 --> 00:39:22.594 region:rollup2
POINT.

00:39:21.125 --> 00:39:24.062 region:rollup2
SO OUR PROPOSED AMENDMENT THAT

00:39:22.594 --> 00:39:25.930 region:rollup2
WE'RE SUGGESTING TODAY IS THAT.

00:39:24.062 --> 00:39:27.999 region:rollup2
.

00:39:25.930 --> 00:39:29.934 region:rollup2
THE COMMISSION. IN REVIEWING

00:39:27.999 --> 00:39:31.102 region:rollup2
SOME STUDIES COMPARATIVE STUDIES

00:39:29.934 --> 00:39:32.604 region:rollup2
BETTER INDIVIDUALIZED FOR EACH

00:39:31.102 --> 00:39:34.339 region:rollup2
OF THESE COMMUNITIES.

00:39:32.604 --> 00:39:36.241 region:rollup2
THAT WITHIN SIX MONTHS OF THAT

00:39:34.339 --> 00:39:37.942 region:rollup2
FINAL REPORT THAT THEY JUST TAKE

00:39:36.241 --> 00:39:39.344 region:rollup2
A LOOK AND MAKE A DETERMINATION

00:39:37.942 --> 00:39:40.845 region:rollup2
WHETHER OR NOT THAT COMMUNITY

00:39:39.344 --> 00:39:42.313 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE OPEN TO COMPETITION.

00:39:40.845 --> 00:39:44.015 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S IT NOW THE COMMISSION

00:39:42.313 --> 00:39:44.916 region:rollup2
COMES BACK AND SAYS NO WE DON'T

00:39:44.015 --> 00:39:46.317 region:rollup2
THINK THAT THERE'S ENOUGH

00:39:44.916 --> 00:39:47.819 region:rollup2
COMPETITION IN THIS COMMUNITY

00:39:46.317 --> 00:39:49.954 region:rollup2
THAN FIND THEN WE WILL LIVE WITH

00:39:47.819 --> 00:39:50.989 region:rollup2
THAT. SO THAT'S OUR FIRST MET

00:39:49.954 --> 00:39:52.857 region:rollup2
FOR THE HIGH COST BUT HEY.

00:39:50.989 --> 00:39:54.225 region:rollup2
THE HIGH COST FUND BE COMMUNITY

00:39:52.857 --> 00:39:54.559 region:rollup2

00:39:54.225 --> 00:39:56.027 region:rollup2
PROGRESSIVELY.

00:39:54.559 --> 00:39:57.362 region:rollup2
.

00:39:56.027 --> 00:39:58.930 region:rollup2
REDUCE ITSELF IN NINETEEN NINETY

00:39:57.362 --> 00:39:59.964 region:rollup2
SEVEN IS ROUGHLY FOUR HUNDRED

00:39:58.930 --> 00:40:01.733 region:rollup2
NINETY MILLION DOLLARS TODAY

00:39:59.964 --> 00:40:03.601 region:rollup2
IT'S A PROBABLY ABOUT TWENTY

00:40:01.733 --> 00:40:04.202 region:rollup2
THREE MILLION DOLLARS TODAY. BUT

00:40:03.601 --> 00:40:05.336 region:rollup2
WE'RE LOOKING AT MORE MORE

00:40:04.202 --> 00:40:06.271 region:rollup2
COMPETITION LOWER THAN THOSE

00:40:05.336 --> 00:40:07.839 region:rollup2
RURAL AREAS

00:40:06.271 --> 00:40:09.374 region:rollup2
AND WE JUST BELIEVE IT IS TIME

00:40:07.839 --> 00:40:11.776 region:rollup2
THAT WE ALSO.

00:40:09.374 --> 00:40:13.278 region:rollup2
SHOULD HAVE EQUAL FOOTING IN A

00:40:11.776 --> 00:40:14.479 region:rollup2
COMPETITION IN THOSE COMMUNITIES

00:40:13.278 --> 00:40:16.714 region:rollup2
SO ALL THAT WE'RE ASKING AND

00:40:14.479 --> 00:40:18.616 region:rollup2
THAT AMENDMENT IS THAT THE PC.

00:40:16.714 --> 00:40:19.918 region:rollup2

CONTINUATION.

00:40:23.855 --> 00:40:28.159 region:rollup2
WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT IS FROM

00:40:26.057 --> 00:40:29.661 region:rollup2
THE LEGISLATURE IS A DESIRE TO

00:40:28.159 --> 00:40:30.962 region:rollup2

SERVICE WRITERS THAT WE PUT

00:41:16.541 --> 00:41:19.877 region:rollup2

01:03:41.051 --> 01:03:44.788 region:rollup2
THE PROCEEDING PROCEEDINGS WE

01:03:42.686 --> 01:03:46.356 region:rollup2
HAVE NOW THAT THAT THAT ARE OPEN

01:03:44.788 --> 01:03:48.692 region:rollup2
FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME. THE
